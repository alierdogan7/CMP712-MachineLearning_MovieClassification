1
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,078
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.

2
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:28,812
Ladies and gentlemen,
this station has the honor to present...

3
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:34,927
<i>...a weekly report on the New York scene
by Alexander Woollcott, The Town Crier.</i>

4
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,655
This is Woollcott speaking.

5
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:41,892
This evening, instead of reporting to you
on the new plays along Broadway...

6
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,832
...I want to say a word about
the swarm of young hopefuls...

7
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:46,801
...who arrive in New York each year...

8
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:50,534
...determined to make good on the stage
if it takes a leg.

9
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,874
I have here over 1000 letters
from such young people...

10
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:57,346
...asking what to do, where to start.

11
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,144
Every one of these people...

12
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:03,653
...thinks that he has more talent
than 90 percent of the actors on Broadway.

13
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:07,315
Broadway. They call it
"The Great White Way."

14
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:11,726
<i>But it shines with a radiance
no electrical company can inspire.</i>

15
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,957
<i>It comes from the likes of you.</i>

16
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,194
<i>One word of advice,
take what you can get.</i>

17
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,998
<i>Grab the chances as they come along.</i>

18
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,301
<i>Act in hallways, sing in doorways...</i>

19
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,104
<i>... and if you have to, dance in cellars.</i>

20
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:36,214
Hello, everybody. How do you do?

21
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,949
We're gonna do a song and a dance
and all for you.

22
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,025
Never seen a better crowd at any place.

23
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,458
We just wanna see you
have a smile on your face.

24
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,326
So here comes our bag of tricks.
We turn on the show.

25
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,059
Drop the nickel in, Nicky,
and here we go.

26
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:55,969
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

27
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:59,236
<i>New York, New York
Fascinating city</i>

28
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:02,711
<i>Magic castles rising in the air</i>

29
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:06,181
<i>Wall Street, Broadway
Guys are sittin' pretty</i>

30
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,150
<i>Every window hides a millionaire</i>

31
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:13,125
<i>So when defeatists holler
"There's no chance"</i>

32
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:17,559
<i>Just tell them this
But with a dirty glance</i>

33
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:22,395
<i>Once Mr. Woolworth
Didn't have a dime</i>

34
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:26,300
<i>And Irving Berlin
Didn't have a rhyme</i>

35
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,373
<i>And Thomas Dewey
Didn't have a crime</i>

36
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:33,569
<i>But anything can happen in New York</i>

37
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,875
<i>Once Rockefeller
Didn't have that oil</i>

38
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,748
<i>And Tiffany
He didn't have a pearl</i>

39
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,214
<i>And Ziegfeld
Didn't even have a girl</i>

40
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,883
<i>But anything can happen in New York</i>

41
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,498
<i>You, too, can be that big ball of fire</i>

42
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:55,964
<i>You, too, can have your name
In Who's Who</i>

43
00:03:56,135 --> 00:04:02,540
<i>You, too, can climb up higher and higher
Until you reach that Rainbow Room</i>

44
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,141
<i>The Wall Street bankers
Didn't have a trust</i>

45
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:12,011
<i>The Automat
It didn't have a crust</i>

46
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:15,154
<i>The Hall Of Fame
It didn't have a bust</i>

47
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,949
<i>But even you can be one in New York</i>

48
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:22,493
<i>Yes, sir
You can be one in New York</i>

49
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,859
<i>You, too, can be that big ball of fire</i>

50
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:29,331
<i>You, too, can start from scratch
And get rich</i>

51
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:32,869
<i>You, too, can climb up higher and higher</i>

52
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:36,736
<i>Like Lord & Taylor, Bonwit Teller
Gimbel, Macy, Rockefeller</i>

53
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:40,504
<i>You can even be an Abercrombie Fitch</i>

54
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:44,943
<i>Once Mr. Morgan
Didn't have a yacht</i>

55
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,918
<i>And Joe DiMaggio
Didn't have a swat</i>

56
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,818
<i>The pot of gold
Didn't have a pot</i>

57
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:56,018
<i>But anything can happen in New
Don't mean innuendo</i>

58
00:04:56,195 --> 00:05:02,100
<i>We mean only in New York</i>

59
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:06,299
Yes, sir! Hey, hey, hey!

60
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,464
That's the show! Hey, hey!

61
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:14,511
Hey, that's us. Feed the little kitty, folks.
We take anything.

62
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,774
Hey, all the way.

63
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,322
Well, Nick, you got the armored car
outside for us tonight?

64
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,084
- Boys, I've got bad news for you.
- What's the matter?

65
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,228
I want you to resign.

66
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,488
You mean,
you want us to quit working here?

67
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,757
Oh, no, sir, Nick. We love you too much.

68
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:37,528
We wouldn't let you sit in this cellar
all by yourself every night, would we?

69
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:38,966
Then I got to fire you.

70
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,470
- Fired?
- Why?

71
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,542
Look, I got the business, yes?

72
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,645
I got the wife, I got the three kids...

73
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,407
...I got myself, I got you, yes?
- Yeah.

74
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:52,915
But I only got three customers
eating my spaghetti.

75
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:56,146
So, I've got to go out of business.

76
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,722
That's too bad, Nick.

77
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:07,098
Don't worry, Nick.
Spaghetti will come back someday.

78
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,834
Hey, what's this? Five bucks.

79
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:15,974
Wait a minute.
Who put this money in there?

80
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,131
- Five dollars?
- Yeah.

81
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,574
It couldn't be that icky from Waterbury,
could it?

82
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:22,180
I don't get it.
She probably thought it was a buck.

83
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:23,872
I'll have to give it back to her.

84
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,077
Hey, you're not gonna cast that nice,
fresh folding money back on the waters.

85
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,722
I hate to do it, fellas,
but things aren't that tough.

86
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,087
And I better do it quick,
before my stomach talks to my willpower.

87
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,195
Hey, wait a minute. Just let me hold it.

88
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,158
Goodbye, Mr. Lincoln.

89
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,303
Excuse me, lady,
but I think you made a mistake.

90
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:51,443
- I found that in the kitty over there.
- Anything wrong with it?

91
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:55,513
- It's a 5.
- The kitty says you take anything.

92
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:57,543
You mean?

93
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:00,743
Gosh, that's an awful lot of admission
just to watch us...

94
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,514
...when you can see the top shows
on Broadway for $4.40.

95
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:06,453
I think your show is as good
as some I've seen on Broadway.

96
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,218
You do? You do?

97
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:11,727
Oh, gosh, thanks.
We kind of think we're pretty good too.

98
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:14,298
The straw hats around here
won't even listen to us...

99
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,265
...and the out-of-town trade
very seldom gets down this way.

100
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,564
Where are you from?
What part of the country?

101
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,037
- I was born in Wisconsin, but l...
- Wisconsin?

102
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,438
Well, that's funny.
My mom was born in Wisconsin.

103
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,908
- You like New York?
- I get tired of it sometimes...

104
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,740
Wait til you start swinging out.

105
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,008
You know something?
You talk just like my mom.

106
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,811
She said that God made New York...

107
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,613
...just so that the good people
would enjoy Wisconsin.

108
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,881
Your mother
might have something there.

109
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,651
No place like it.
That's what I tell her in every letter.

110
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,591
Where else can a fellow
shoot out of a firetrap like this...

111
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,924
...into a top spot on Broadway?

112
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:49,226
Sure, it happens every day.
Fellow comes in, sees something he likes.

113
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,597
Says, "That's it."
Your name goes up in lights.

114
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,238
- You're a hit overnight.
- Really?

115
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:57,206
- Sort of like Horatio Alger, isn't it?
- Yeah, yeah.

116
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:01,611
Only it hasn't happened to us
like that yet.

117
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:04,648
The roof caved in on us tonight.
This bin's gonna close up.

118
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,045
But we're on the upbeat.

119
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,620
When we become headliners, we'll send
you tickets, get your money's worth.

120
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:13,190
- You do that. I'll give you my address.
- Swell.

121
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,452
- There.
- Well, thank you very much.

122
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:18,290
Miss Jones from Wisconsin.

123
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,964
You've been darn swell to us.

124
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:24,660
If you need a couple of fellows to
show you the city or anything like that...

125
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,738
Well, here, I'll give you one of our cards.
There you are.

126
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,542
Which of the Three Balls of Fire are you?

127
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,745
I'm the one you can't get any insurance on.
Tommy Williams.

128
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,888
You can phone me at Pitt-Astor Drugstore.
I'm there all the time.

129
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:47,492
It's kind of like an actors' clearing-house.
I'd like to show it to you sometime.

130
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,584
That's very nice, Tommy.

131
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:52,629
- I'm much obliged.
- Why, not at all.

132
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,892
You liked our act, didn't you?
You give a fella a lot of heart.

133
00:08:56,068 --> 00:09:00,630
You know, the last person that made me
feel this good was my mother.

134
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:04,375
That's a nicer compliment than I paid you.
You'll hear from me.

135
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,308
You just drop your hat
and I'll come running.

136
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,414
Oh, and thanks again for this fiver.

137
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:12,142
You know, you made Santa Claus
seem like a schoolboy.

138
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:17,119
It won't seem so much when you split it
three ways and deduct the income tax.

139
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,258
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

140
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,401
- Hello.
- Hello.

141
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,505
- Hi, Tommy, Hammy.
- Hi, ladies.

142
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,641
- Tommy, I got that part.
- Swell, Sally.

143
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,036
- Wonderful.
- Great.

144
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,609
- Hi, sexy boy.
- Oh, hello, fellas.

145
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,610
- Been making the rounds?
- And how.

146
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,772
- Anything new?
- Yeah, did you have any luck?

147
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,441
I saw 14 producers,
but nobody's producing.

148
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,883
<i>Oh, dear. That's...</i>

149
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:54,587
Hi, Bert. Keep those sidewalks
hot enough nowadays, don't they?

150
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,354
- Stop looking at that 85c dinner.
- Boys, what will it be?

151
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,054
- Steak, medium.
- Chicken, fried.

152
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,596
- Squab, broiled.
- Yeah, I know.

153
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,701
- Three hams on rye and heavy on the ham.
- Oh, that's very funny.

154
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,894
- There was a call for you guys.
- Call for us?

155
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:09,633
- Yeah, the Thornton Reed office.
- Thornton Reed's office.

156
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,837
- Thornton Reed?
- Easy, buddy.

157
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,876
Don't you think it's too warm for jokes?

158
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:17,504
I don't know, but she says Thornton Reed
Productions wants you before 6:00.

159
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,345
How can we lose? We've been turned down
by every producer.

160
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:25,013
Look here, Shorty, if this is a gag,
you've seen your last banana split.

161
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,833
Hey, excuse me, ma'am.

162
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:47,708
This may sound crazy to you,
but did you call us?

163
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:49,972
Well, who are you?

164
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:57,948
Well, we're the Three...

165
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:00,490
- Balls of Fire.
- Balls of Fire.

166
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,289
Right in there, please.

167
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,098
Well, go ahead. It's only a doorknob.

168
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,578
Well, hello.

169
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:29,483
But, miss, I thought that you were...

170
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:32,556
In Wisconsin?
I'm afraid not, not for 20 years.

171
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:37,822
- But, Miss Jones, l...
- Hey, you're not Jonesy?

172
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:40,932
<i>Not the famous Jo... Holy...</i>

173
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,595
Well, aren't you going to sit down?

174
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,630
Oh, yeah.

175
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:49,236
And I was gonna show you New York.

176
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,610
Maybe you will someday.
You know, I've never really seen it all.

177
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,439
Now, boys, to get down to business.

178
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,877
Mr. Reed is producing
a new musical revue.

179
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,516
I have spoken to him about you.

180
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,379
- About us?
- Thornton Reed?

181
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,680
<i>This is getting to be like
Alice in Wonderland.</i>

182
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:05,915
So if you'll be at the old Amsterdam
tomorrow morning at 11:00...

183
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:08,185
...I may be able to get him
to watch your act.

184
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,055
But please, you mustn't tell a soul.

185
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:14,029
This is a very private audition.
Mr. Reed doesn't like actors.

186
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,027
Well, do you think you can make it?

187
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:21,332
- Make it?
- Right now, we've been there for hours.

188
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,737
Hello. Oh, yes, Thornton.

189
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,673
See you tomorrow morning
at the theater.

190
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,140
- Thank you very much.
- Yes, Thornton.

191
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:31,783
You don't know what you've done.

192
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,384
What did you say, Thornton?

193
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:37,886
I mean, what did you say, Thornton?
Oh, I don't know.

194
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,388
I don't see any objection to Philadelphia.

195
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,827
Read that, please. Read that.

196
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:48,160
- Thanks very much. Goodbye.
- Bye.

197
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,071
Sorry. Come on.

198
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,156
- Hammy.
- Hiya, Jenny.

199
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,452
You look as if you swallowed
the Academy Award.

200
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,856
I'm really riding.

201
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:20,590
Thornton Reed has just asked us
to come over to a little audition tomorrow...

202
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:22,825
...at the old Amsterdam.
- Thornton Reed?

203
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,300
Listen, you better come over.
You never can tell.

204
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,269
- Thanks. That's one I owe you.
- But you better keep it quiet.

205
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,635
- Don't forget kids, 11:00 sharp.
- Thanks, Tommy.

206
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,904
That's all right. Shorty, remember those
ham sandwiches we ordered?

207
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,512
Trade them in for top sirloins.

208
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,479
- How do you want them?
- On a plate with a lot of potatoes.

209
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:42,109
I'm not kidding. Tomorrow at the old
Amsterdam. Don't forget to tell Eddie.

210
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,778
Keep this under your hats, kids.

211
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:46,550
Thornton Reed's new musical,
the old Amsterdam, tomorrow.

212
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,022
Actors working, yeah!

213
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,954
Wait a minute, Shorty.
That's kind of quick, isn't it?

214
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,566
- Pitt-Astor's super service.
- What did you do, send out for it?

215
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:59,127
This is what I've been telling you
fellas about, eating acting.

216
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,273
- Yes.
- Yeah.

217
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,638
What's that?

218
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,818
Excuse me, I'll be back in a minute.

219
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:22,894
- Hey, you can't do that.
- Go away.

220
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:28,859
- What are you crying about?
- None of your business.

221
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:44,678
All right, come on, come on, break it up.
You've gotten your laugh.

222
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,408
I don't think I like you.

223
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,018
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

224
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,417
- Now that we know each other...
- But we don't.

225
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,853
My name is Williams, Tommy Williams.
What's yours?

226
00:14:54,260 --> 00:15:00,529
It doesn't matter. I'm just a failure.

227
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,725
Oh, well, I was a failure yesterday.
Now look at me today.

228
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,769
You mean,
you even looked worse yesterday?

229
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,868
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

230
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,216
But I was a success yesterday.

231
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:21,615
You mean,
you even looked better yesterday?

232
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:29,954
Oh, I worked and I slaved.

233
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:36,628
There were only three words in the part,
but, oh, they were such beautiful words.

234
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,326
"I love you"?

235
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,462
No.

236
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,744
"The telephone, madam."

237
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,606
I never got past "the telephone."

238
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:57,613
I just haven't got any talent.

239
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,818
Well, you cry awfully pretty.

240
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,559
- You think so?
- Yeah, no question.

241
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,134
And I wouldn't worry
about three tired little words.

242
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,430
You have talent.
Why, you're steaming with it.

243
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:14,936
It's coming out all over you.

244
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:18,603
And don't say you can't act,
because you can act.

245
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:21,712
You're not unhappy,
you're only making yourself believe you are.

246
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,611
And that's acting.
And that's why it's wonderful.

247
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,878
You mean I don't really feel badly at all?

248
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:31,545
Oh, of course, you do.
Of course, you do. Excuse me.

249
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:35,216
But those are 14-karat tears
and you don't wanna waste them...

250
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:39,524
...because someday, they'll come in awfully
handy at the curtain of the second act.

251
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:44,329
But don't you have to feel better
to be able...?

252
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,971
Sure you do,
but you don't want to let them touch you.

253
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:51,098
Why, I'll bet right at this minute
you have more talent than Katharine Cornell.

254
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:54,040
I'll bet at this minute
I've got more talent than Barrymore.

255
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,738
That's what you've got
to keep dreaming and thinking.

256
00:16:56,915 --> 00:17:00,681
And when things get so bad
that you just wanna holler murder...

257
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,185
...that's when you sell yourself
a bill of goods.

258
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,256
And if you can do it then,
you can sell anybody.

259
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:15,066
I guess I'm getting to be
quite a speechmaker.

260
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:19,760
You know,
you don't talk like an actor at all.

261
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:24,500
Oh, but I act like one.
You're through with that?

262
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,701
- Oh, yeah, here.
- Thanks.

263
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:30,906
Well, now that I've straightened
your life out, what's your name?

264
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:34,277
- Penny.
- Penny, just like that?

265
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,978
- No puns.
- All right, one-cent.

266
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,624
- Where do you live?
- I live down that way.

267
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:45,287
- Would a nickel swing it?
- No, but two might.

268
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,489
All right, I'm declaring myself a partner.

269
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,260
- Come on.
- All right.

270
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:57,073
- Hey, where you going?
- I'm gonna fly this little sparrow home.

271
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:01,702
Well, stay out of the stratosphere,
Cock Robin. We've got an act to rehearse.

272
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:08,145
- You live far from the subway?
- I practically live in it.

273
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,617
- Hiya, Mary.
- Hello, Penny.

274
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,949
- Hello, Johnny. How's your mother?
- Much better.

275
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,591
- Thanks for the cake.
- Okay.

276
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,852
Well, here we are.

277
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:19,293
- How are you on steps?
- Terrific.

278
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,780
Hello, Papa. Papa.

279
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,474
Oh, hello, dear. Oh, hello, hello.

280
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,642
- Papa, this is Mr. Williams.
- How do you do?

281
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,846
- How do you do? I hope we didn't interrupt.
- No, not at all.

282
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:46,490
Barbara Jo is late again.

283
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,058
Penny, if she comes,
you tell her she's a bad girl.

284
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:53,665
You know, every time I have an orchestra
rehearsal for those children, why, I'm late.

285
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:57,165
- Goodbye, young man. Glad to know you.
- Bye-bye, sir.

286
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,668
- Oh, my.
- I hope I didn't drive him out.

287
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:03,239
He was just afraid I was gonna ask him
if he collected from Mrs. Mulligan.

288
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,569
He just won't ask for money.

289
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,342
Boy, I'll bet this piano has played
a lot of empty stomach music.

290
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,279
Yeah. Would you like a piece of cake?

291
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:15,420
- Cake? Did you bake it?
- No, but I bought it.

292
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:18,215
- Oh, bring it on then.
- All right.

293
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:27,230
Where's Papa Morris? I'm late.

294
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,629
Well, excuse me.
Are you taking a lesson?

295
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:32,395
No, no, I'm just tuning the piano.

296
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,562
You mean I won't be able
to take a lesson?

297
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,141
You certainly won't. Where've you been?
This is the third time in a row...

298
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,278
- It's wonderful, wait till you hear.
- What?

299
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:43,107
They got the thing passed.
We're all going to the country.

300
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,182
Two weeks, for free.
Isn't that marvelous?

301
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,318
- All the kids?
- The whole settlement house.

302
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:50,455
Mr. Stone just told me.
And I'm president of the whole thing.

303
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:53,819
- Congratulations.
- This is Barbara Jo. This is Mr. Williams.

304
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:57,484
- Pleased to meet you, Mr. Williams.
- Mr. Williams is an actor, you know.

305
00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:02,032
<i>- A real actor? On the stage?
- Well, I...</i>

306
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,328
Here's your cake. Here, Barbara Jo.

307
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:08,098
Gee, you don't look like an actor.

308
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,735
That's what most of the producers think.

309
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:14,537
- Won't you sit down, Mr. Williams?
- Thank you.

310
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:20,109
You know, Mr. Williams, there's a couple
of things I don't understand about acting.

311
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,716
Only a couple of things?

312
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:26,385
When you're on the stage...

313
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,651
...you have your arms around the girl
and say:

314
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:31,591
"I love you more than
anything in the whole world."

315
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,094
- Yeah?
- Do you really mean it?

316
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:37,759
Well, that depends upon the girl.

317
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,201
Yeah, I suppose so.

318
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:45,809
But, gee, when Robert Taylor says it,
he makes me believe it.

319
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:49,436
You know, Penny's gonna be an actress.
She's always acting.

320
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:53,073
- Eat your cake, darling.
- Well, I am eating it.

321
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:58,656
Oh, well, got to be going.
Big meeting tonight.

322
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,088
Wait until the kids
find out they're really going.

323
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,125
Some of them
never even seen the country.

324
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:06,560
- Tell Papa I couldn't help it.
- I'll tell him, but you better practice.

325
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:09,132
Why, Penny, you know I love to practice.

326
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:12,134
Goodbye, Mr. Williams.
Sure like to see you act sometime.

327
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:13,737
Well, thank you.

328
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:15,463
Bye, Penny.

329
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:25,709
- Won't you sit?
- Won't you sit?

330
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:33,756
Here we are, just as if we had planned it.

331
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:36,485
Yeah, you mean just as if we didn't.

332
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:46,131
You know, I have a feeling that you're
gonna be that unknown quantity in my life.

333
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,897
What's that?

334
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,142
Something
that brings a fellow good luck.

335
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:55,542
The springboard. The inspiration.

336
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:59,275
The thing that everything adds up to.

337
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:02,511
Gee, that's quite an assignment.

338
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,387
Not with what you have.

339
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,088
Just what have I, Mr. Williams?

340
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:14,232
Well, it's a combination.

341
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:19,564
A combination of something sweet
and warm.

342
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:26,806
Plus a quality
that's far away from everybody.

343
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:30,345
Reflection of talent, that's what it is.

344
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:35,243
There's something special
lighting everything around you.

345
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,516
- I didn't know I had that.
- Sure, that's what you have.

346
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,625
And as soon as I see
Thornton tomorrow...

347
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:44,455
...why, I'm gonna tell him
to take a good look at you.

348
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:47,928
Before you know it, we'll be dancing
on top of the world, together.

349
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:52,628
Oh, gee, that would be fun,
if it ever came true.

350
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:54,863
As soon as I get through
with the audition...

351
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,602
...why, I'll come back over here
and you'll see how true it is.

352
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,507
Well, just so you won't get lost.

353
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,910
I'll be at the settlement house
filing envelopes.

354
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:07,813
And you can park your dream boat
right outside the entrance.

355
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,847
- Now, will you do something for me?
- Lf I can.

356
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:17,552
- Will you sing me a song?
- How do you know I can?

357
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:22,223
Because you sing when you talk,
when you walk.

358
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:25,265
Why, you're eyes are...
Why, they're singing right now.

359
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:28,333
They are?

360
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,468
Well, I'll be darned.

361
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:47,859
<i>When a girl meets boy</i>

362
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:54,488
<i>Life can be a joy</i>

363
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,293
<i>But the note they end on</i>

364
00:23:56,468 --> 00:24:02,634
<i>Will depend on
Little pleasures they will share</i>

365
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:09,304
<i>So let us compare</i>

366
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:14,914
<i>I like New York in June</i>

367
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:18,522
<i>How about you?</i>

368
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:22,126
<i>I like a Gershwin tune</i>

369
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:26,196
<i>How about you?</i>

370
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:33,133
<i>I love a fireside
When a storm is due</i>

371
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:37,036
<i>I like potato chips
Moonlight and motor trips</i>

372
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:41,111
<i>How about you?</i>

373
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:47,650
<i>I'm mad about good books
Can't get my fill</i>

374
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:54,122
<i>And Franklin Roosevelt's looks
Give me a thrill</i>

375
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:59,127
<i>Holding hands in the movie show
When all the lights are low</i>

376
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:04,360
<i>May not be new
But I like it</i>

377
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:10,133
<i>How about you?</i>

378
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,809
<i>I like Jack Benny's jokes</i>

379
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,108
<i>To a degree</i>

380
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:21,741
<i>I love the common folks</i>

381
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,117
<i>That includes me</i>

382
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:32,120
<i>I like to window shop on 5th Avenue</i>

383
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:35,824
<i>I like banana splits
Late supper at the Ritz</i>

384
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:39,198
<i>How about you?</i>

385
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:46,368
<i>I love to dream of fame
Maybe I'll shine</i>

386
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:52,347
<i>I'd love to see your name
Right beside mine</i>

387
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:55,145
<i>I can see we're in harmony</i>

388
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:00,223
<i>Looks like we both agree
On what to do</i>

389
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,519
<i>- And I like it
- And I like it</i>

390
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:08,792
<i>- How about you?
- How about you?</i>

391
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:12,999
<i>I'm so delighted
I've ignited the spark within you</i>

392
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:16,629
<i>Let me continue to make it burn</i>

393
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:20,005
<i>With you, I will be like a Trilby
So let's not dally</i>

394
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:23,409
<i>Come on, Svengali
I've lots to learn</i>

395
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:28,178
<i>When you're arising
Start exercising daily</i>

396
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,287
<i>For example
Just a sample</i>

397
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:33,652
<i>Bend and touch the floor
Fifty times or more</i>

398
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:37,158
<i>A fine start
To be a Bernhardt</i>

399
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,594
<i>A dictionary's necessary
But not for talking</i>

400
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,791
<i>It's used for walking
The Ziegfeld way</i>

401
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:47,598
<i>Is this okay?</i>

402
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:51,037
<i>That's the trick
You're catching on quickly</i>

403
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:52,540
<i>Should I take a bow?</i>

404
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,372
<i>Oh, let me show you how</i>

405
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:58,004
<i>- Just like partners on the stage
- Yeah.</i>

406
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:03,951
<i>If you can use a partner
I'm the right age</i>

407
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:29,694
Hey, don't go under there.

408
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:32,666
The way our luck's been running,
I wish it was Friday the 13th.

409
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:35,237
- Oh, no, you don't.
- Wait a minute, what's the idea?

410
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:37,738
- This happens to be Friday.
- And the 13th.

411
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:38,898
It is?

412
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:40,476
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

413
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,544
Strange. Well, here we are.
Remember, this Thornton Reed is big-league.

414
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:47,116
This is a private audition.
No mugging, no pressing.

415
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,048
- Don't look anxious.
- All right.

416
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:54,183
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!

417
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:57,290
Look's like
somebody's been reading our mail.

418
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:01,364
Easy, folks. Easy, folks. Do you realize
you're getting on Mr. Reed's nerves?

419
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:04,593
Mason, where's the boy
with my sandwich?

420
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:07,670
He'll be here.
I think he got lost in the crowd.

421
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:11,172
- I can't even get a 10c sandwich.
- Thornton, remember your headache.

422
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:14,072
Don't rub me down.
You're the cause of all this.

423
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:17,043
You and your discoveries.
I don't want to discover anyone.

424
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:19,683
I give you my word.
This time, I only told three boys.

425
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:21,409
Where, in Yankee Stadium?

426
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:24,384
This is wonderful.
Every actor in New York will love you.

427
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:28,219
I don't want every actor in New York
to love me. I want my wife to love me.

428
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:32,989
- Drink this.
- I don't want it, I want my sandwich. I'm...

429
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,927
Mason, you've got to keep them back.

430
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:37,260
- Please, please, please.
- I'm keeping them back.

431
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:40,563
People, you must stop this nonsense.

432
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:45,801
All I'm doing is a little intimate musical,
not the Passion play.

433
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:50,539
- Quiet, quiet, quiet!
- Listen, we want to give everyone a chance.

434
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:54,412
But unless you line up so I can see you,
I'll have to call the whole thing off.

435
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,553
- Come on, Jenny. Let's get in.
- Get in, Helen.

436
00:30:57,722 --> 00:31:01,488
- Quit shoving back there, you pig.
- What's the big idea?

437
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:05,060
Mr. Reed, you don't know us, but
we just closed the Tip-Top Inn in Albany.

438
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,857
Yeah, we're the Four Hot Licks.

439
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,020
- May...
- Ray...

440
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,757
- Fay...
- And Kay.

441
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:14,997
<i>Oh, sextet from Madam Lucia</i>

442
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:18,802
<i>Oh, sextet
I love you, yeah</i>

443
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:21,673
Please, please, some other time.

444
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:25,111
Mason, have them pass by in one line
so we could get through with this.

445
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:26,545
Mr. Reed will see you.

446
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,845
- Keep in one line, keep moving.
- No, I'm sorry.

447
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,954
- Make it snappy.
- Yes, I could use you.

448
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:33,113
- Yes, no, too small.
- Just keep on going.

449
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,555
- No, too short. No, boys.
- No.

450
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,558
- What do you mean, no?
- But, Thornton...

451
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,527
- I mean no, I can't use you.
- Well, how do you know?

452
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,791
- How do l...?
- You haven't seen us do anything.

453
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:46,334
We're the Three Balls of Fire.
Once we get started, you can't put us out.

454
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,904
But I can put you out
before you get started. Mason.

455
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:53,032
Thornton, wait. These are the boys I've
been telling you about. They're tremendous.

456
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,441
In three years,
they'll be greater than Astaire.

457
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:58,810
Then bring them back in three years.
I'm sorry, lad, some other time.

458
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:01,144
- Not now, that's all. I'm sorry.
- Mr. Reed, l...

459
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,650
All right, keep them going.

460
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,015
- Just keep on going.
- No, no, no, I'm sorry.

461
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:08,818
No, I can't use you.
No, no children. No, no children.

462
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:12,656
Wait, wait,
don't send my brother to the chair.

463
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:17,494
Don't let him burn.
Please, please, warden, please.

464
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:21,400
Mr. Reed, I have some clippings here.
This is Maxine when she was a little girl...

465
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:24,336
Mason, Mason.

466
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:28,544
Maybe we ought to change our name
to the Three Puffs of Smoke.

467
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:31,841
Private audition.
How do you like her, giving us that?

468
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:35,918
It's not her fault.
It's those producers. They're all the same.

469
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:41,525
Just send out nonchalantly for 1000 actors
every time they get lonesome.

470
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:48,594
Well, I guess we're cooked, fellas.
Yep, on both sides.

471
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:49,994
What do we do now, Tom?

472
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:53,069
I've been pedaling that hocus-pocus
about talent and ambition.

473
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:57,367
They don't want talent. They wouldn't know
talent if it was wrapped up in the mailbox.

474
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,203
I guess it's back to the bulrushes.

475
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:02,107
Maybe I don't belong in show business.
I don't know.

476
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,710
It's all right, I'll do something else. Drive
a truck, dig ditches, sell shoes, anything.

477
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:09,216
Take it easy, Tommy.
You know you're not serious.

478
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,514
We'll be back
making the rounds again tomorrow.

479
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:13,657
- Something will turn up.
- Not me, brother.

480
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,225
What are you trying to do,
split up the axis?

481
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:18,362
How long you gonna go
through life singing?

482
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,191
How long are you gonna
keep yourself in hock to producers?

483
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:23,334
Until you become a producer yourself.

484
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,698
Until you become a producer yourself.
That's very funny.

485
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,862
Until you become a producer yourself.

486
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:37,244
Sure. Why not?

487
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,851
There's nothing magic to it.

488
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:47,924
All you need is a little courage,
taste, money.

489
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:51,220
Yeah, and we're loaded
with courage and taste.

490
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:55,127
We've got lots of talent.
So why don't we sign ourselves up?

491
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:59,395
Four months ago, when we came to this
city, we devoted our lives to the theater.

492
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,504
Here comes the Gettysburg Address.

493
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:04,004
We got the brush
from the New York producers.

494
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:05,403
Living or dead.

495
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:08,409
We've got a satchel full of talent
and no place to display it.

496
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:10,342
So we'll build our own showcase.

497
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:14,609
- Have you forgotten about money?
- Or are you planning to win a raffle?

498
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,215
Money? Well, anybody can
put on a show with money.

499
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,084
Let's not be corny about this thing.

500
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:23,352
Oh, certainly, can't be corny,
so let's forget about money.

501
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:25,086
What do we use instead?

502
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:31,061
<i>Well, anything. We can use...</i>

503
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:37,939
Well, you know... like a... a cause.

504
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,734
- A what?
- A what?

505
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,469
A cause.

506
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:48,051
A great, big beautiful cause.
Something that'll tug at their heartstrings...

507
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:51,347
...make them dig down in their jeans
and bring tears to their eyes.

508
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:53,114
You better stop eating that salami.

509
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,384
Don't you realize that America
is cause-crazy?

510
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,326
Why, they give shows for everybody.
China, the Red Cross, Bundles for Britain.

511
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,863
There must be some place
they haven't thought of.

512
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:03,762
Right here.

513
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:06,561
Now you're talking.

514
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:08,898
How about a cause for eatless actors?

515
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:13,373
Actors? No, nobody cares about actors.
It's gotta be something solid.

516
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:16,377
- Like widows, orphans, dogs.
- How about mailmen or motormen?

517
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:19,072
- No, no, glamour.
- How about ball players?

518
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,480
They've all got chicken farms.

519
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:25,144
- Hey, I got it. I got it.
- Well, what is it?

520
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,757
How about chorus girls?

521
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,656
Well, how about them?

522
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:38,035
I'm sorry, Hammy.
I guess I'm just blowing bubbles again.

523
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,968
If only I hadn't written
that big buildup to Mom...

524
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,801
...promised the city hall to everybody.

525
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:53,712
Hey, where are you going?

526
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:57,753
I'm gonna get a little air. I'm a little flat.

527
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:28,751
What's your claim?

528
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:35,581
Look, look,
things can't be as bad as all that.

529
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:39,563
You don't know what happened.

530
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:43,863
Something awful happened to me,
but I'm not crying, look.

531
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,299
You're a boy.

532
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:52,006
You know, you cry awfully pretty.

533
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:57,609
- I do?
- Sure, you cry beautifully.

534
00:36:57,782 --> 00:37:01,946
Why, if I thought I looked that pretty,
I'd be crying my eyes out all the time.

535
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:05,111
You know what?
I'm gonna make you my official crier.

536
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:10,683
Well, and as soon as things get tough...

537
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:13,591
...why, I'll give you the signal
and you can turn it on.

538
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:17,825
Why, everybody can cry
if they're unhappy themselves.

539
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:20,994
It's not me so much. I've seen it.

540
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:25,905
But some of the other kids,
they never even been there.

541
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:30,514
<i>- And those old trustees...
- The who?</i>

542
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:32,371
The Board of Trustees.

543
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:37,852
They promised we were going to the country
for two whole weeks.

544
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:41,958
And now they tell us
they can't give us the money.

545
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:46,786
Well, don't you worry about it.
You're still young.

546
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:50,365
<i>You have lots of time to go to the...</i>

547
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:58,031
Hey, what did you say?

548
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:06,246
We were gonna see cows and brooks
and milk them and everything.

549
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:09,352
You mean, they backed out on you?

550
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:15,091
Why, I've never heard of such a thing.
Why, how dare they do that?

551
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:18,456
- Come on, we'll go see about it right now.
- See about what?

552
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:22,087
These kids have never seen the sunlight,
babbling brooks, blade of grass...

553
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:24,166
...a bluebird flitting from tree to tree.

554
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:27,236
What has happened to the milk
of human kindness? Where is he?

555
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:29,930
- Where's who?
- The whatchamacallit, the number one guy.

556
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:32,371
- The superintendent? He's inside.
- That's our man.

557
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:34,773
<i>Why, the idea of these people,
these children...</i>

558
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,115
So all you have to do is give us the word
and we're ready to go.

559
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:40,682
I like your enthusiasm.

560
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:43,285
I'm afraid it's a much bigger job
than you imagine.

561
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:45,581
No, it isn't.
You see, Tommy's a professional.

562
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:49,351
Yes, I know, but where are you
going to get all the talent?

563
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,962
Talent?
Why, the world is riddled with talent.

564
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,257
You can shake it out of trees.
It's right here.

565
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:58,630
This girl right here, she's
the greatest singer of songs I ever heard.

566
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:01,203
You've got the greatest crying act
in show business.

567
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:02,964
<i>And as for myself, well...</i>

568
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,576
And if that isn't enough, I can
walk into a drugstore on 44th street...

569
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:09,474
...throw a rock, hit more talent
than on any Broadway show.

570
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:11,842
Well, that takes care of the talent.

571
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,484
Now, where do you propose
putting this show on?

572
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:15,983
In the auditorium?

573
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:18,621
They couldn't seat over
100 people there.

574
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:22,020
No, this has gotta be big.
This isn't gonna be any amateur night.

575
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,421
It's gotta be gigantic.

576
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:26,961
Like the World Series or the Aquacade.
This is Rose Bowl stuff.

577
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:29,463
Why, it looks as if
you'll need a whole city block.

578
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:31,066
Yeah.

579
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:38,965
City block. Yeah. Sure, that's it.
Right in the neighborhood.

580
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:41,168
We'll rope it off.
Everybody will come to it.

581
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:45,748
We give them a sample, then pass the hat.
With the money we take, we'll hire the hall.

582
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:49,113
Put on a show for half a buck
that'll send those kids to the country.

583
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:51,584
Well, I must admit
you have a wonderful platform.

584
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:53,747
- Couldn't we, Mr. Stone?
- Please, please?

585
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:57,451
Well, in the face of all this enthusiasm,
what can I say?

586
00:39:57,628 --> 00:40:02,065
But I'm not guaranteeing
that Mr. Busch will be swept off his feet.

587
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,530
Mr. Busch? Who's Mr. Busch?

588
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:08,570
The district leader. He's the only one
who can give you a permit for a block party.

589
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,902
- Tough customer?
- A very tough customer.

590
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:15,907
Come on, we'll go there, see if we
can cut him down to our size. Bye.

591
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,809
- Thank you.
- That's quite all right.

592
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:23,648
So here's this character sitting there,
Simon J. Busch.

593
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:25,152
Typical ward heeler.

594
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:29,156
Heater sticking out the side of his mouth,
big black derby with heart to match.

595
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:31,817
So I go to work on him. I say:

596
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:37,730
"Mr. Busch, if you donate this city block,
it'll send you to Congress."

597
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:39,563
He keeps on smoking.

598
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:44,299
I try to appeal to his sense of chivalry.
He can't even spell it.

599
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:48,639
I talk to him about his school days.
He never went.

600
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:51,475
Things are desperate
and Barbara Jo was crying so hard...

601
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:54,447
...she looks like a road show edition
of the Johnstown flood.

602
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,348
So I slide right into the theme song.

603
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,450
"Mr. Busch, you're not gonna keep
these starving kiddies away...

604
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,528
...from the babbling brooks,
and the birds that sing...

605
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:09,188
...and the vitamins A, B, C, and D.

606
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:13,234
You're not gonna be responsible
for young America growing up with rickets.

607
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:15,998
Oh, no, not you, Mr. Busch.

608
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:20,269
Not you. Not a man who reminds me
so much of Thomas Jefferson."

609
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:22,344
Then I had tell him who Jefferson is.

610
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:24,481
I tell you, he folded up
like a wet tent.

611
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:27,378
He started to cry, tears came
as big as Ping-Pong balls.

612
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:29,314
He just couldn't resist the cause.

613
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,148
It's the sucker shot of the century.

614
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,654
If we play our cards right,
use those kids right...

615
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:37,760
...we'll land right in the middle of Broadway
with four-forty written all over us.

616
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:43,456
And all the time, Mr. Busch just kept
sitting there, smoking that smelly old cigar.

617
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:46,000
And just when I was sure
he was gonna say no...

618
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,297
...Mr. Williams got right on top
of the desk...

619
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:50,599
...and he told him
what wonderful kids we were.

620
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:54,403
And if we didn't all get sunshine
and fresh air, we'd wind up with pickets.

621
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:56,773
- With what?
- Pickets.

622
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:58,244
Darling, you mean rickets.

623
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:02,579
Well, anyway, he was wonderful,
and Mr. Busch finally said he'd go it.

624
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:04,345
- And you know what, Penny?
- What?

625
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,457
All I could think of was...

626
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:12,860
...was Abraham Lincoln
freeing the slaves.

627
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,956
I'm gonna tell him you said that.

628
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:17,794
- He'll like that.
- Oh, I wish you would.

629
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:20,801
- Gee, he's exceptional.
- Yeah.

630
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:23,872
Too bad he isn't better-looking.

631
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:29,069
Why, Barbara Jo, he's fine-looking.
He's got character in his face.

632
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:33,182
You know he turned down an opportunity
in a Broadway show just to do this?

633
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:34,783
- Honest?
- Yes.

634
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:36,977
And you'll never know
what that meant to him.

635
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:41,215
I couldn't have done it,
not even my three little words.

636
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:46,227
Gosh, he never stops
to think of himself.

637
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:48,595
But he'll be paid back.

638
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:56,034
You know, Penny, if it was
anybody else but you, I'd be jealous.

639
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:01,067
If it was anybody else but him,
you could have him.

640
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:25,693
- Is it all right?
- Yeah.

641
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:28,133
- Let's get it on the pole.
- Okay.

642
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,834
- How's that?
- Swell, Tony.

643
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:32,771
The tempo's perfect. Just right.

644
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,911
I know my dance all right.
Can I go now?

645
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:36,876
Sure, Ronnie. Sign your name over here.

646
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:40,107
- I'll have to take the children.
- Right. Thank you, Mrs. Crainen.

647
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,684
- Come on, children.
- Jenny, give me that.

648
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:44,912
Everybody, can I have
your attention please?

649
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,886
After you get through with your work...

650
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:50,254
...whether painting a sign,
practicing a song or dance, you can leave.

651
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:53,089
Other performers are coming in.
They have to rehearse too.

652
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:57,063
After your work, sign one of these cards
before you go out. Thanks, everybody.

653
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:59,828
Oh, Penny, get your costume on.
We're gonna do our skit.

654
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:02,097
- All right.
- Will you come and see my costume?

655
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:03,466
I have no time now.

656
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:11,304
All right, everybody,
let's have it quiet, please, quiet now!

657
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:13,966
Everybody, take those signs
and banners and posters...

658
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:15,611
...and put them in the anteroom.

659
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:18,179
Move that piano here in this corner.
Hurry up, now!

660
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:21,181
All the rest of you,
come on down here by the stand here.

661
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:23,216
Come on, right up close to the platform.

662
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,947
That's it. Now let me have
your attention please! Quiet!

663
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:30,287
Now, look, we're gonna do the number first,
so all of you get in your aprons and overalls.

664
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:33,555
Come on, now, let's move.
And don't forget, give us lots of zambo.

665
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,358
Go ahead, take it, Johnny.

666
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:54,614
<i>When our grandmas and our grandpas
Were just girls and boys</i>

667
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:59,313
<i>They seemed to have
A lot more fun than we</i>

668
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:05,824
<i>Their party clothes were calicoes
And homemade corduroys</i>

669
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:11,263
<i>And a big event
Was called a husking bee</i>

670
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:15,337
<i>A banjo and a fiddle
And a big old-fashioned barn</i>

671
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:19,067
<i>Was all the preparation that they made</i>

672
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:23,943
<i>And if they tell you otherwise
Dismiss it as a yarn</i>

673
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:28,915
<i>Refreshments were confined to lemonade</i>

674
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:34,820
<i>Now, you may say it's corny
And I guess I must agree</i>

675
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:38,025
<i>But it was good enough for grandma</i>

676
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:41,130
<i>It was good enough for grandpa</i>

677
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:46,463
<i>And it's good enough for me</i>

678
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:51,131
<i>Hoedown
The country's gone hoedown</i>

679
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:57,269
<i>It's puttin' its toe down
And kickin' its heel</i>

680
00:46:57,447 --> 00:47:01,611
<i>Hoedown is really a rare dance</i>

681
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:07,087
<i>A pioneer square dance
But with a new deal</i>

682
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:13,022
<i>One, two
Swing your partner lightly</i>

683
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:18,191
<i>While you hold her ever so tightly</i>

684
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:22,464
<i>Hoedown
And bring your best beau down</i>

685
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:28,168
<i>We're facing a showdown
And gotta make hay</i>

686
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:34,284
<i>'Cause hoedown's on its way</i>

687
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:41,752
<i>Stand in line and do the turkey
Like a Yankee Doodle Dandy</i>

688
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:44,416
<i>When you turkey, do it jerky</i>

689
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:46,654
<i>That's the trick
Now you're hoein' on down</i>

690
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:51,927
<i>Sashay, sashay, sashay around
While you're hoein' on down</i>

691
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:57,062
<i>Form a circle in the middle
Everybody allemande</i>

692
00:47:57,241 --> 00:48:01,905
<i>Boys keep tempo with the fiddle
And your gal in the calico gown</i>

693
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:07,516
<i>Hoe on down with your calico gown</i>

694
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:11,415
<i>Do-si-do around
It's very romantic</i>

695
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:12,816
<i>Do-si-do</i>

696
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:16,858
<i>Do-si-do some more
And maybe she'll fall</i>

697
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,295
<i>Now it's time to do your honors</i>

698
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:22,796
<i>Then when you've gone
Through your honors</i>

699
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:27,903
<i>Promenade the hall</i>

700
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:32,064
<i>Hoedown
The country's gone hoedown</i>

701
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:38,272
<i>Its puttin' its toe down
And kickin' its heel</i>

702
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:42,282
<i>Hoedown is really a rare dance</i>

703
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:47,549
<i>A pioneer square dance
But with a new deal</i>

704
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:53,552
<i>One, two
Swing your partner lightly</i>

705
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:58,326
<i>While you hold her ever so tightly</i>

706
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:02,563
<i>Hoedown
And bring your best beau down</i>

707
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:08,336
<i>We're facing a showdown
And gotta make hay</i>

708
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:12,881
<i>'Cause hoedown's on its way</i>

709
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:22,535
Hey!

710
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:09,410
<i>Hoedown
And bring your best beau down</i>

711
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:14,483
<i>We're facing a showdown
And gotta make hay</i>

712
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:20,190
<i>So hoedown
Showdown</i>

713
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:27,360
<i>Hoedown on its way</i>

714
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:35,010
- Mr. Stone, you sent for us?
- Yes, I did.

715
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:37,703
I just received this letter
from the Board of Trustees.

716
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,872
I'd like to read it to you.

717
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,207
Oh, here we are.

718
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:45,752
"We are sending you 20 refugee youngsters
from the British war relief...

719
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:47,082
...on the Fourth of July.

720
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:48,724
We want you to entertain them...

721
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:51,759
...and show them what a real
American Fourth of July is like."

722
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:53,725
This is a great honor for us.

723
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,024
"A shortwave broadcast
has been arranged...

724
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:59,259
...and the English children
will talk to their parents in London...

725
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:02,064
...directly from the settlement house."

726
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:06,767
The only difficulty is that the broadcast
is scheduled for 3:00.

727
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:11,211
But that's the time that the block party
is scheduled for.

728
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:13,246
Yes, I know, and I'm very sorry, Tommy.

729
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:17,250
But can't you postpone the block party
till the following week?

730
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,150
- No, that's no good.
- We'll never get a permit again.

731
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:23,121
Wait a minute.
You say they're gonna broadcast, huh?

732
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:27,191
Well, why not hook up the broadcast
with the block party?

733
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:30,629
From the sidewalks of New York,
straight to the Lambeth Walk, huh?

734
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,201
Tommy, that's an excellent idea.
I'll speak to the board about it.

735
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:36,066
- But, Tommy...
- Wait a minute.

736
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:37,797
- You do that, will you?
- I will.

737
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:41,000
And I'll take care of everything.
Now, go on. Go on, now.

738
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,645
- I don't get it.
- Neither do I.

739
00:54:44,814 --> 00:54:47,874
Those Bundles from Britain will
be a fine act for us to follow.

740
00:54:48,051 --> 00:54:49,643
- I hope they're a sensation.
- What?

741
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:50,808
- Don't you get it?
- No.

742
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:53,251
Three Balls of Fire.
Flashlights, newsroom, radio.

743
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:55,823
Kids torn from their mothers,
thrown into our laps...

744
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:59,359
...and an international hookup.
- I never thought of the publicity angle.

745
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:02,191
What a showcase.
This is the cause we've been looking for.

746
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:05,562
We've been worrying about kids
that nobody cares about to the country.

747
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:07,259
We don't need them anymore.

748
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:11,339
<i>Penny, it'll be no time until we'll be dancing
right up on top of the...</i>

749
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,501
Penny, what's the matter?

750
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:19,847
Did you say we don't even need
those kids anymore?

751
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,017
<i>Penny...</i>

752
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:33,285
Why didn't you guys shut me up?

753
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:42,534
<i>Penny, I...</i>

754
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:47,467
<i>If you'll only...</i>

755
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:50,340
What's the matter,
did you run out of speeches?

756
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:54,844
You know, you make me
feel pretty awful.

757
00:55:55,018 --> 00:56:00,388
Well, you shouldn't.
You're getting everything you wanted.

758
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:04,254
First, you wanted a cause.
Well, you got it.

759
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:08,989
Then you wanted a showcase.
Well, you got that too.

760
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:13,829
Then you wanted to get to Broadway.
Well, you're gonna get there.

761
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:17,029
Of course, you may knock down
a few people and climb over them...

762
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,334
...but you'll get there.

763
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:22,701
You're gonna be a big success.

764
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:27,817
You ought to be very happy.

765
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:35,181
Penny. Gee, you said that
as if you hated me.

766
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:39,889
That's silly. I don't hate you.
I think you're wonderful.

767
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:45,262
- Your talent, your ambition...
- Well, then, what's the matter?

768
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:47,232
Nothing.

769
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:53,434
I just don't think
you're Abraham Lincoln anymore, that's all.

770
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:24,431
Go on, there's your cue.

771
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:27,508
No, no. This is your party.

772
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:34,706
Ladies and gentlemen...

773
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:38,217
...I think it's wonderful the way
you've turned out for our block party.

774
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:42,188
The purpose of this was to give you
a sample of what you're gonna see later on.

775
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:45,088
And of course, to collect enough money
to hire a theater.

776
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:46,592
We're gonna pass the hat now.

777
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:49,664
Everything we collect will go
towards putting on our big show.

778
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:51,926
And we hope to raise enough money
from that...

779
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:54,899
...to send the settlement house kids
to the country.

780
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:59,974
And now, there's someone that
Mr. Stone feels that you ought to meet.

781
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,976
And nothing would have been possible
without him.

782
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:07,549
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Mr. Tommy Williams.

783
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:14,279
You really gave me away.

784
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:20,754
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.
Thank you very much.

785
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:24,195
<i>I, well...</i>

786
00:58:24,367 --> 00:58:27,200
Well, in the face of all this,
there's just nothing I can say.

787
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:29,863
For the first time in his life.

788
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:32,439
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a big surprise for you.

789
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:34,042
As our special guest today...

790
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:37,338
...we have a group of young people
all the way from London, England.

791
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,540
In a few moments, their mothers
and fathers will be with us too...

792
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:43,584
...by way of shortwave
transatlantic hookup.

793
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:46,449
I now take great honor
in presenting to you at this time...

794
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:49,057
...our little cousins from across the sea.

795
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:05,337
<i>- Hello. Hello, Mrs. Downing.
- Yes, this is Mrs. Downing.</i>

796
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:07,976
We have your daughter here.
All right, Elinor.

797
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:13,138
<i>- Hello? Mommy? Is that you?
- Hello, darling. Yes. How are you?</i>

798
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:17,514
Oh, splendid, Mommy.
I've gained 5 pounds.

799
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:19,177
How's Daddy and Rex?

800
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:22,085
<i>Daddy's fine.
Rex is wagging his tail right now.</i>

801
00:59:22,258 --> 00:59:25,591
<i>- How are you getting along, dear?
- Oh, hunky-dory.</i>

802
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:30,131
<i>- What did you say?
- Hunky-dory. That's American for "okay."</i>

803
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,790
Okay, Elinor.

804
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:35,369
Hello, Mr. Phillips. Come in, Mr. Phillips.

805
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:40,035
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, son. How are you, old boy?</i>

806
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:43,667
<i>Fine. I... l...</i>

807
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:47,145
<i>Is that all you have to say for yourself?
How do you like America?</i>

808
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:51,219
Fine little place. Only they drive
on the wrong side of the road.

809
00:59:51,387 --> 00:59:53,855
<i>Anything you want me
to tell Grandmother?</i>

810
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:56,992
Oh, yes. Tell her to change the mark
on the kitchen wall.

811
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,593
I've grown a whole inch taller.

812
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:01,787
<i>Good enough. Keep growing, Robert.
We'll be seeing you soon.</i>

813
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:03,489
Righto, governor.

814
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:06,726
Oh, tell Billy Hammond
I'm learning to roller skate.

815
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:08,734
Thank you, Robert. That was swell.

816
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:12,705
And now, London, I want to introduce
little Barbara Jo Conway...

817
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:15,639
...who is acting as official hostess
to all your children...

818
01:00:15,812 --> 01:00:20,749
...at the Fourth of July celebration
down here on the East Side of New York.

819
01:00:20,917 --> 01:00:24,080
Hello? Hello, London? Can you hear me?

820
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,547
Gosh, it's wonderful
to have your children here.

821
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:28,452
We really wish you were here too.

822
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:32,561
And now we've got a special song for you
and Penny Morris is gonna sing it for you.

823
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:37,632
Really, folks, I wish you could see her.
She's beautiful.

824
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:52,138
<i>From the dark cafes of Paris</i>

825
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:58,379
<i>From the streets of Amsterdam</i>

826
01:00:59,022 --> 01:01:05,518
<i>From the homes of old vienna</i>

827
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:12,558
<i>To the shores of Uncle Sam</i>

828
01:01:13,603 --> 01:01:20,600
<i>Wherever freedom's hope is true</i>

829
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:28,341
<i>Each heart cries out to you</i>

830
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:37,316
<i>Don't give up, Tommy Atkins</i>

831
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:40,326
<i>Be a stout fella</i>

832
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:45,524
<i>Chin up! Cheerio! Carry on!</i>

833
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:51,265
<i>Keep a stiff upper lip
When you're in doubt, fella</i>

834
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:56,378
<i>Chin up! Cheerio! Carry on!</i>

835
01:01:56,546 --> 01:02:01,609
<i>Oh, the sun's sure to smile
On your tight little isle</i>

836
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:06,949
<i>So hang on to your wits
And you'll turn the blitz on Fritz</i>

837
01:02:07,123 --> 01:02:12,720
<i>There's a whole world behind you
Shoutin', "Stout fella!"</i>

838
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:18,834
<i>Chin up! Cheerio! Carry on!</i>

839
01:02:26,342 --> 01:02:31,871
<i>Don't give up, Tommy Atkins
Be a stout fella</i>

840
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:36,883
<i>Chin up! Cheerio! Carry on!</i>

841
01:02:37,053 --> 01:02:42,389
<i>Keep a stiff upper lip
When you're in doubt, fella</i>

842
01:02:42,558 --> 01:02:47,291
<i>Chin up! Cheerio! Carry on!</i>

843
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:52,457
<i>Oh, the sun's sure to smile
On your tight little isle</i>

844
01:02:52,635 --> 01:02:57,868
<i>So hang on to your wits
And you'll turn the blitz on Fritz</i>

845
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:03,376
<i>There's a whole world behind you
Shoutin', "Stout fella!"</i>

846
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:08,506
<i>Chin up! Cheerio! Carry on!</i>

847
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:16,683
<i>Don't give up, Tommy Atkins
Be a stout fella</i>

848
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:21,523
<i>Chin up! Cheerio! Carry on!</i>

849
01:03:21,697 --> 01:03:27,260
<i>Keep a stiff upper lip
When you're in doubt, fella</i>

850
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:32,203
<i>Chin up! Cheerio! Carry on!</i>

851
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:37,369
<i>Oh, the sun's sure to smile
On your tight little isle</i>

852
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:42,575
<i>So hang on to your wits
And you'll turn the blitz on Fritz</i>

853
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:48,247
<i>There's a whole world behind you
Shoutin', "Stout fella!"</i>

854
01:03:48,424 --> 01:03:50,654
<i>Chin up!</i>

855
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:53,557
<i>Cheerio!</i>

856
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:58,257
<i>Carry on!</i>

857
01:04:04,273 --> 01:04:11,270
<i>Carry on!</i>

858
01:04:18,454 --> 01:04:20,445
I knew I never should have
opened this show.

859
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:23,353
Thornton, don't let these
small-town critics get you down.

860
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:26,359
Oh, a Boy Scout could tell
what's wrong with this turkey.

861
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:28,258
It's tired, it's stale, it needs air.

862
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:30,365
All we need is
a couple numbers and jokes.

863
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:32,626
Jokes? I expected someone
to come out and say:

864
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:34,929
"Who was that lady
I seen you with last night?"

865
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:38,403
Mason, call New York.
Get Jonesy on the phone.

866
01:04:38,574 --> 01:04:40,064
I'll make a show of this yet.

867
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:42,234
Get me New York, Plaza 66601.

868
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:45,073
Say, how about changing the costumes
on that hotel number?

869
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:48,684
Sure, only we'll change the costumes
and the music and the backdrop...

870
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:51,183
...and the actors,
every mother's ham of them.

871
01:04:51,354 --> 01:04:54,187
- What are you gonna do, close?
- Thornton Reed never closes.

872
01:04:54,357 --> 01:04:58,453
- Hello? Hello, Jonesy?
- Give me that. Jonesy.

873
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:03,429
Oh, yes, Thornton.
Yes, I've seen the notices. Yes, Thornton.

874
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:07,057
We need a new first-act finale
and a new number in the second act.

875
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:09,261
Call every agent in New York,
if you have to.

876
01:05:09,438 --> 01:05:11,338
But be here tomorrow night sure...

877
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:14,738
...and bring some performers with you
that can sing and dance.

878
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:19,280
Yes, and for the love of Philadelphia,
don't bring them in wheelchairs.

879
01:05:24,553 --> 01:05:29,320
Get Marelli. See if he can get
Lane and Abbot for Mr. Reed immediately.

880
01:05:44,073 --> 01:05:45,938
- Excuse me.
- Well, Tommy.

881
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:48,076
Have you seen your pictures
in the papers?

882
01:05:48,244 --> 01:05:50,508
Yeah, say, how about that?

883
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:54,741
- Look, look. Oh, I've got more too.
- I suppose you'll send them to your mother?

884
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:57,351
Yeah, she'll think I'm running
for president.

885
01:05:57,987 --> 01:06:00,854
All hokum aside, Jonesy,
how did you like us last night?

886
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:03,589
I was really impressed.

887
01:06:03,759 --> 01:06:05,750
Well, if you like us,
then we're on our way.

888
01:06:05,928 --> 01:06:08,863
We got $42 last night
and with your contribution, it makes 67.

889
01:06:09,031 --> 01:06:11,864
All we need is a theater.
You find out about the old Duchess?

890
01:06:12,034 --> 01:06:13,763
Yes, and Mr. Reed still owns it.

891
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:16,871
But I'm afraid it won't be any good
to you, Tommy.

892
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:19,530
- Why not?
- Well, it hasn't been occupied in years.

893
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:21,540
Hasn't even any seats in it.

894
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:23,508
Well, it has a stage, hasn't it?

895
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:26,375
Yes, but it's a warehouse.

896
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:30,041
Oh, we don't care. We'll take it.
Here, I got the bread right with me. Here.

897
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:32,915
- Sixty-seven dollars.
- No, Tommy. I'd have to ask Mr. Reed.

898
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:36,718
And I can't bother him now.
He's having so much trouble.

899
01:06:36,892 --> 01:06:40,191
Hello? Oh, hello, Marelli.
Did you get them?

900
01:06:40,796 --> 01:06:45,631
But Mr. Reed will give them 1500
and feature billing.

901
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:49,332
All right, Marelli. Yes, I know you tried.
Thank you.

902
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,865
Don't see why he wouldn't let us
have it for one night.

903
01:06:54,043 --> 01:06:55,408
We'd fix it up and everything.

904
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:59,607
The Duchess? No, no, Tommy.
That's completely out of the question.

905
01:06:59,782 --> 01:07:04,549
Poor Thornton.
I don't know what I'm going to do.

906
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:07,747
Look, you don't happen
to know of an act...

907
01:07:07,923 --> 01:07:12,519
...a good group that could be spotted
a couple of times in Mr. Reed's show?

908
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:14,424
- Sure, I do.
- Who? Where?

909
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:18,158
- Right here. The Three Balls of Fire.
- No, no, Tommy, I need a big act.

910
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:21,167
Twelve, 15 people, and a singer.

911
01:07:21,337 --> 01:07:24,397
What about our group and Penny?
How about the act we did yesterday?

912
01:07:24,573 --> 01:07:27,508
- It stopped traffic. You said so yourself.
- I wonder...

913
01:07:27,676 --> 01:07:31,407
<i>No, no, no. Thornton wouldn't...</i>

914
01:07:32,148 --> 01:07:35,015
I don't know why not, though.

915
01:07:35,584 --> 01:07:39,645
Look, could you get that wonderful girl?
What's her name?

916
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:41,915
- Penny. Penny Morris?
- Yes, could you get her?

917
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:44,889
Your gang from the drugstore.
Get them together and rehearse.

918
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:48,997
Do the number tomorrow afternoon at
a matinee exactly as you did it last night.

919
01:07:49,165 --> 01:07:52,657
You mean that? You mean?
You mean it? We're gonna...?!

920
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:57,135
Yes, for Mr. Reed's show tomorrow
in Philadelphia.

921
01:07:57,306 --> 01:07:59,740
Tomorrow. Sure, why not?

922
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:02,844
All right. Get them all together.
Be here in my office at 5:00.

923
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:08,109
We're taking the 6:00 train for Philadelphia,
and may heaven have mercy on my soul.

924
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:13,984
Six o'clock, 5:00.
We'll be here. Okay!

925
01:08:14,957 --> 01:08:17,755
All aboard for Philadelphia!

926
01:08:21,997 --> 01:08:24,693
Don't move! Stay where you are!
Stop me if I sound crazy...

927
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:29,099
...but tonight, you, me, and all the kids from
the drugstore are leaving on the train...

928
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:32,502
...and tomorrow in Philadelphia,
we open in Thornton Reed's new show!

929
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:38,670
You think I'm crazy, but I'm not.
We're going tonight.

930
01:08:38,848 --> 01:08:41,681
No luck, eh? Hallelujah.
Truth will out, talent will tell!

931
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:43,284
- Now, wait...?
- I can see it now.

932
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:47,013
Tommy Williams, Penny Morris,
the Balls of Fire in lights as big as coconuts!

933
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:51,285
Success! Success, in three easy lessons.
Now what do you think of Williams?

934
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:54,860
- I think Williams is still Williams.
- What?!

935
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:57,362
You're going to Philadelphia?
Without me, because...

936
01:08:57,533 --> 01:09:00,991
Without you? Penny, are you crazy?
This is it. What are you talking about?

937
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:03,468
The same thing.
Those little kids we promised...

938
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:05,800
That was before.
Thornton Reed, he's in trouble.

939
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:08,375
If we can save this show,
we can land our own ticket.

940
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:10,944
What about Hammy, Ray,
all the kids at the drugstore?

941
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:13,343
They waited all their lives
for a shot like this.

942
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:15,040
But Reed's got a million dollars.

943
01:09:15,217 --> 01:09:18,948
And you and I and Hammy and Ray
can hang on till we get another chance.

944
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:22,579
- But, gosh, those little kids...
- No.

945
01:09:22,758 --> 01:09:23,986
Oh, Tommy, don't you see?

946
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,958
It's not the two weeks in the country
that's gonna cure them.

947
01:09:27,129 --> 01:09:29,359
It's giving a kid something
he's dreamed about...

948
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:32,797
...so maybe he won't feel like
there's nothing left to go on for later.

949
01:09:32,968 --> 01:09:36,028
Gosh, I wanna go to Philadelphia
just as much as you do.

950
01:09:36,205 --> 01:09:40,198
But if I did it, it would be just like stealing
their stockings off the Christmas tree.

951
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:42,367
I can't do that. I just can't, that's all.

952
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:44,012
You don't get the point at all.

953
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,240
I'm talking about the lives and careers
of 15 people. Artists.

954
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:50,476
I'm talking about Tommy Williams
and Penny Morris, the performers.

955
01:09:50,653 --> 01:09:53,213
That has nothing to do with kids
getting to the country.

956
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:55,414
Let's get to be stars first
and then we can...

957
01:09:55,591 --> 01:09:58,492
Never mind, don't bother.
You haven't heard anything I've said.

958
01:09:58,661 --> 01:10:01,858
- Don't make me do anything I regret...
- Go on! Go to Philadelphia!

959
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:03,589
I hope you stop the show!

960
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:06,360
Well, all right, then.

961
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:11,296
I'll get it fixed!

962
01:10:12,908 --> 01:10:17,572
Mr. Williams! Mr. Williams! Mr. Williams,
I've been looking for you all morning...

963
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:20,579
- I'm sorry, I'm awfully busy.
- Please, it's awfully important.

964
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:22,717
Everybody's waiting in the auditorium.

965
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:25,217
Well, all right, hurry up,
I've got an appointment.

966
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:27,184
Thanks a lot. It'll only take a minute.

967
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:34,124
Hey, what's this all about?

968
01:10:35,864 --> 01:10:37,126
- What do you want?
- Come on.

969
01:10:37,299 --> 01:10:39,699
- Look, here he comes! Here he comes!
- Here he comes!

970
01:10:39,868 --> 01:10:41,699
- Yeah.
- Come on!

971
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:52,614
Well, Mr. Williams,
all the kids and myself...

972
01:10:52,781 --> 01:10:55,011
...we had a meeting
of the executive committee...

973
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:58,244
...and we were talking about how you
gave up a big Broadway show...

974
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:02,584
...to do all this for us
and we weren't doing anything for you.

975
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:05,192
Well, that's not right.

976
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:08,922
There's been a lot of talk around this place
about getting us to the country.

977
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:12,727
But nobody ever did anything about it
except you.

978
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:16,667
You just walked right in
and didn't listen to anybody.

979
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:22,368
And now we're going.
After all the promises, we're really going.

980
01:11:22,578 --> 01:11:28,107
Well, well, we just wanna say thank you.

981
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:31,344
But with 50 kids to do it,
it would take an awful long time.

982
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,010
We know you're a busy man.

983
01:11:33,188 --> 01:11:40,185
So we all chipped in and
bought you a present, and here it is.

984
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:04,347
You shouldn't have.
You shouldn't have done this, because l...

985
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,181
Don't you like it?

986
01:12:06,355 --> 01:12:09,051
Sure, sure I like it.

987
01:12:10,292 --> 01:12:17,130
It's swell. In fact, it's one of
the nicest presents I've ever seen.

988
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:21,859
You shouldn't have spent the money
on me, though.

989
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:26,635
But I'm glad you did,
because every time I look at this watch...

990
01:12:28,377 --> 01:12:30,368
...l'm gonna see every one of your faces...

991
01:12:30,546 --> 01:12:34,243
...and gonna remember
what a swell gang you are.

992
01:12:35,918 --> 01:12:39,479
Honest, you'll never know
what it means to me.

993
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:45,616
All I can say is that
I haven't even started to earn it.

994
01:12:45,794 --> 01:12:47,625
But I will.

995
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:50,260
And after it's all over with
and all through...

996
01:12:50,432 --> 01:12:54,994
...I hope that you'll be glad
that you gave it to me.

997
01:12:56,138 --> 01:12:58,368
And you don't have to worry
about the country...

998
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:04,638
...because you're not only going,
but you're gonna go first class too.

999
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:18,254
Penny. Penny.

1000
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:21,088
- Hello, Mr. Stone.
- How do you do?

1001
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,425
Oh, excuse me. Is Penny here?

1002
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:29,799
- I think she's up on the roof.
- Oh, thanks.

1003
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:43,812
<i>Penny...</i>

1004
01:13:43,986 --> 01:13:46,682
You better hurry.
You're gonna miss that train.

1005
01:13:47,489 --> 01:13:51,152
I just have one more speech to make
and I have to make it.

1006
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:55,922
You don't have to listen
if you don't want to.

1007
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,293
Go ahead, I'm listening.

1008
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:04,533
All my life, I've been rehearsing myself
to be a big man...

1009
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:08,335
...and it's taken me just five minutes
to find out that I'm only a heel.

1010
01:14:08,877 --> 01:14:11,402
Bunch of little kids chip in
their nickels and dimes...

1011
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:16,244
...to buy me a $5 watch
marked down to 3.50. There it is.

1012
01:14:17,019 --> 01:14:20,113
And I'm so ashamed at myself
that it took a bunch of 6-year-olds...

1013
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:25,090
...to make me realize that there's more to
life than just a song, a dance and an encore.

1014
01:14:25,694 --> 01:14:30,427
And that there's more to people than just
sitting out front, being an audience.

1015
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:37,062
Well, it's half past 1
and that's the end of my speech.

1016
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:40,800
Oh, Tommy, that's a wonderful speech.

1017
01:14:42,744 --> 01:14:45,679
And life begins at half past 1.

1018
01:14:50,953 --> 01:14:55,219
Penny, I've got a couple of words
I wanna say to you...

1019
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:58,654
...just this time, sitting down.

1020
01:15:00,762 --> 01:15:02,662
Only a couple?

1021
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:06,099
Well, really three.

1022
01:15:07,302 --> 01:15:10,601
Well, go ahead and say them
and get them over with.

1023
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:17,508
Oh, I could say "I love you"
just like all the rest of them.

1024
01:15:18,614 --> 01:15:20,878
That's still good, you know.

1025
01:15:21,049 --> 01:15:23,882
But it wouldn't tell you
what I really mean.

1026
01:15:24,486 --> 01:15:25,919
I'll settle for it.

1027
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:29,421
Oh, no, you're not gonna talk me
out of my love scene.

1028
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:37,297
Were you ever in a rainstorm...

1029
01:15:37,466 --> 01:15:41,300
...and you felt like you were the only person
in the world that wasn't getting wet?

1030
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:43,734
Did you ever look up
and see a full moon and...

1031
01:15:43,906 --> 01:15:46,306
...well, it only looked like
a half a moon to you...

1032
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:48,500
...because you were
looking at it all alone?

1033
01:15:49,578 --> 01:15:52,411
Penny, did you ever find someone and...

1034
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:59,520
...and all of a sudden, you felt like
you were taking off, right out into space...

1035
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:05,593
...like a propeller going round and round
and round, 30,000 revolutions a minute...

1036
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:09,026
...and there wasn't any landing fields
left in the world?

1037
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:13,224
I've had that feeling.

1038
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:16,371
And it all started in a drugstore.

1039
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:22,475
- Penny.
- Yeah?

1040
01:16:25,447 --> 01:16:26,846
Tommy.

1041
01:16:27,015 --> 01:16:30,678
Oh, isn't it wonderful what you can find
these days in drugstores?

1042
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:32,945
- Yeah.
- Oh, gosh.

1043
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:40,987
And that's about all there is to it.

1044
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:49,227
I know, it even sounds crazy to me,
but that's the way it has to be.

1045
01:16:50,305 --> 01:16:53,502
Well, I guess I'll have to send
these railroad tickets back, then.

1046
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:59,213
Gee, I hate to have you do that.

1047
01:17:00,082 --> 01:17:02,550
- Maybe if l...
- Tommy.

1048
01:17:04,553 --> 01:17:07,021
I hope you don't think we're ungrateful,
Miss Jones...

1049
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:09,953
...because you've
been simply wonderful...

1050
01:17:10,525 --> 01:17:14,291
...but this is the way Tommy and I
have decided to do it.

1051
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:16,431
Isn't it, Tommy?

1052
01:17:16,898 --> 01:17:22,336
Yeah, yeah, that's what we've decided.

1053
01:17:23,338 --> 01:17:27,138
You're giving up this great opportunity
to help a bunch of kids you hardly know.

1054
01:17:30,345 --> 01:17:32,905
Helping people's hard work, isn't it?

1055
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:34,309
Don't you worry.

1056
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:39,819
You'll find it's worthwhile at
the oddest times and the strangest places.

1057
01:17:43,392 --> 01:17:45,292
How soon can you get
your show together?

1058
01:17:47,629 --> 01:17:51,258
Our show? Oh, in about 10 days.

1059
01:17:51,433 --> 01:17:53,958
Yeah, our only problem
is getting a theater.

1060
01:17:54,136 --> 01:17:57,333
Well, there's no problem now.

1061
01:17:58,206 --> 01:18:01,232
- You mean we can have the old Duchess?
- Yes.

1062
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:04,174
No, put your bread away.
If the theater's any good to you...

1063
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:07,179
...you can have it as
Thornton's contribution to the cause.

1064
01:18:07,983 --> 01:18:09,416
He doesn't even have to know.

1065
01:18:09,584 --> 01:18:12,849
It's on Gilmore Street, about seven
blocks from the settlement house.

1066
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:15,717
- How about that?
- It's wonderful, I don't know what to say.

1067
01:18:15,891 --> 01:18:17,188
Don't say anything.

1068
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:19,623
Just get your show started
and make it good.

1069
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:22,992
Thornton doesn't know it,
and he won't until I'm ready to tell him...

1070
01:18:23,165 --> 01:18:26,225
...but he's gonna see your show
in his theater from the front row.

1071
01:18:26,401 --> 01:18:28,062
- Oh, you see, Tommy?
- Yeah.

1072
01:18:28,236 --> 01:18:30,898
But Miss Jones,
won't Mr. Reed be angry?

1073
01:18:31,073 --> 01:18:33,667
Very likely.
That's why it's got to be good.

1074
01:18:33,842 --> 01:18:38,074
Otherwise, I'll find myself in the country
with the rest of the kids.

1075
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:37,269
Gosh. Isn't it beautiful?

1076
01:19:38,907 --> 01:19:41,432
It's kind of run-down, isn't it?

1077
01:19:43,345 --> 01:19:45,176
It's wonderful.

1078
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:49,881
Well, maybe after we clean it up
and brighten it a little...

1079
01:19:50,051 --> 01:19:54,215
...but right now,
it's giving me the creeps.

1080
01:19:54,389 --> 01:19:58,951
- It does?
- It's kind of like a haunted house.

1081
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:02,620
Penny, every theater is a haunted house.

1082
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:05,323
Ghosts with greasepaint...

1083
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:09,095
...ghosts that sing and dance
and laugh and cry.

1084
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:13,740
You should think of all the shows
that have been in this theatre.

1085
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:20,479
Flops, successes, bad shows,
great shows.

1086
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:24,383
You can't tell me that that ever dies.

1087
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:30,514
It's all around us right now,
all the laughter and applause, cheers.

1088
01:20:31,259 --> 01:20:34,626
Why, it's on every inch
of this old stage up here.

1089
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:39,395
- Do you see what I mean?
- Yeah, I see what you mean.

1090
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:41,832
Then when new ones come along,
kids like us...

1091
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:44,437
...that love the theatre
just as much as they did...

1092
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:47,370
...they're glad and they're rooting for us.

1093
01:20:47,542 --> 01:20:51,103
They're saying, "This is your chance.

1094
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:55,113
Go on out there, we've had ours,
now it's your turn.

1095
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:57,808
There's your audience.
They're waiting for you."

1096
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:02,081
Can't you just see it now?

1097
01:21:04,259 --> 01:21:05,954
Look.

1098
01:21:06,561 --> 01:21:10,827
The leader taps his stand with his stick.
The music starts.

1099
01:21:10,999 --> 01:21:13,365
The footlights gradually come up.

1100
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:17,904
This is that one breathless moment when
everything in the world comes to a stop.

1101
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:21,807
Over in the wings, the light man
at the board reaches for the switch.

1102
01:21:21,977 --> 01:21:26,107
Now the hands that pull the curtain
are on the rope, waiting for the cue.

1103
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:29,182
The curtain rises slowly.

1104
01:21:29,918 --> 01:21:34,150
I never saw them, but I feel as though
I'd been here watching them every night.

1105
01:21:34,623 --> 01:21:37,888
<i>Richard Mansfield in Cyrano de Bergerac.</i>

1106
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:41,790
I know just how he felt,
standing there, waiting for his cue.

1107
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:47,364
Your nose is rather large.

1108
01:21:48,036 --> 01:21:52,029
- Have you quite finished, sir?
- I should say that is sufficient.

1109
01:21:52,207 --> 01:21:54,300
You humdrum dolt.

1110
01:21:54,476 --> 01:21:58,742
How dare you insult a splendid nose
with such meager, piddling words?

1111
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:02,077
Let me show you what you might
have said had you had an ounce...

1112
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:05,219
...yes, even an ounce of imagination
or wit.

1113
01:22:05,387 --> 01:22:08,288
To wit, insolent.

1114
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:11,181
What do you do with that nose
when drinking?

1115
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:15,125
Does it go above the glass or below
the glass, for surely, it does not fit inside.

1116
01:22:15,297 --> 01:22:18,528
Descriptive. It's a rock.

1117
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:23,093
It's a mountain.
What am I saying, a mountain?

1118
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:28,734
It's a peninsula. Eloquent.

1119
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:35,577
What is that dazzling thing, sir?
Is it a torch? A bonfire? A volcano?

1120
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:37,684
Stamp it out before it blinds my eyes.

1121
01:22:37,852 --> 01:22:42,414
- Buffoon.
- Who, me?

1122
01:22:43,058 --> 01:22:45,185
So be it.

1123
01:22:46,294 --> 01:22:50,355
Prepare to die exquisitely.

1124
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:52,693
- Poet.
- Yes, poet.

1125
01:22:52,867 --> 01:22:58,237
Swordsman, take your choice.
No, wait. You shall have both.

1126
01:22:58,406 --> 01:23:02,638
For while I fight with you,
I shall compose a ballad...

1127
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:09,717
...and with the last line of my poem,
my sword shall run you through.

1128
01:23:09,918 --> 01:23:12,751
<i>Swiftly, my hat is tossed aside.</i>

1129
01:23:12,921 --> 01:23:15,583
<i>Slowly, my cloak is allowed to fall
over my left free arm.</i>

1130
01:23:15,757 --> 01:23:18,658
<i>And to draw and we stand on guard.</i>

1131
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:24,356
<i>Lunge, and my sword is met with yours.
Dancers of steel that dazzle the eye.</i>

1132
01:23:24,532 --> 01:23:26,762
<i>Back you go, in time to my verse.</i>

1133
01:23:26,935 --> 01:23:30,666
<i>And then, when I have finished my song,
you die.</i>

1134
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:34,104
<i>Pray now, while you still have life.</i>

1135
01:23:34,275 --> 01:23:36,835
<i>Prince, pray, with your final sigh.</i>

1136
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:39,947
<i>Stay, look sharp, I've run out of verse.</i>

1137
01:23:40,115 --> 01:23:47,078
<i>And now, as I finish my song,
you die</i>

1138
01:24:02,137 --> 01:24:07,700
<i>For it is Mary, Mary</i>

1139
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:11,812
<i>Plain as any name can be</i>

1140
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:14,972
<i>But with propriety</i>

1141
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:21,282
<i>Society will say "Marie"</i>

1142
01:24:21,456 --> 01:24:26,587
<i>But it was Mary, Mary</i>

1143
01:24:26,761 --> 01:24:30,561
<i>Long before the fashions came</i>

1144
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:37,604
<i>And there is something there
That sounds so square</i>

1145
01:24:37,772 --> 01:24:42,471
<i>It's a grand old name</i>

1146
01:24:42,644 --> 01:24:47,843
<i>But it was Mary, Mary</i>

1147
01:24:48,016 --> 01:24:52,146
<i>Long before the fashions came</i>

1148
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:56,120
<i>And there is something there</i>

1149
01:24:56,291 --> 01:25:00,057
<i>That sounds so square</i>

1150
01:25:00,228 --> 01:25:06,656
<i>It's a grand old name</i>

1151
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:20,146
<i>For she's my Daisy</i>

1152
01:25:20,315 --> 01:25:23,250
<i>My bonnie Daisy</i>

1153
01:25:24,018 --> 01:25:26,384
<i>She's as sweet as sugar candy</i>

1154
01:25:26,554 --> 01:25:28,988
<i>And she's very fond of Sandy</i>

1155
01:25:29,157 --> 01:25:35,619
<i>And I worry for my dearie</i>

1156
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:41,929
<i>I would rather lose my kilt
Than lose my Daisy</i>

1157
01:25:47,675 --> 01:25:54,171
<i>For I would rather lose my kilt
Than lose my Daisy</i>

1158
01:26:01,756 --> 01:26:06,557
<i>Sure, I've got rings on my fingers
And bells on my toes</i>

1159
01:26:06,728 --> 01:26:10,664
<i>Elephants to ride upon
My little Irish rose</i>

1160
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:14,393
<i>So come to your nabob
On next Patrick's Day</i>

1161
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:18,061
<i>Be Mistress Mumbo-Jumbo
Jij-Ji-Bo J. O'Shea</i>

1162
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:23,108
<i>Sure, I've got rings on my fingers
And bells on my toes</i>

1163
01:26:23,278 --> 01:26:26,907
<i>Elephants to ride upon
My little Irish rose</i>

1164
01:26:27,081 --> 01:26:30,812
<i>So come to your nabob
On next Patrick's Day</i>

1165
01:26:30,985 --> 01:26:37,447
<i>Be Mistress Mumbo-Jumbo
Jij-Ji-Bo J. O'Shea</i>

1166
01:27:33,147 --> 01:27:39,643
<i>I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy
Yankee Doodle do or die</i>

1167
01:27:39,954 --> 01:27:46,450
<i>A real live nephew of my Uncle Sam
I was born on the 4th of July</i>

1168
01:27:46,828 --> 01:27:53,324
<i>I've got a Yankee Doodle sweetheart
She's my Yankee Doodle joy</i>

1169
01:27:54,335 --> 01:27:57,600
<i>Yankee Doodle came to London
Just to ride the ponies</i>

1170
01:27:57,772 --> 01:28:01,208
<i>Say, I am a Yankee Doodle Boy</i>

1171
01:28:01,576 --> 01:28:08,072
<i>He's a Yankee Doodle Dandy
A Yankee Doodle do or die</i>

1172
01:28:08,416 --> 01:28:14,912
<i>A real live nephew of his Uncle Sam
Born on the 4th of July</i>

1173
01:28:15,356 --> 01:28:19,315
<i>I've got a Yankee Doodle sweetheart</i>

1174
01:28:19,494 --> 01:28:22,657
<i>She's my Yankee Doodle joy</i>

1175
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:26,658
<i>Yankee Doodle came to London
Just to ride the ponies</i>

1176
01:28:26,834 --> 01:28:32,636
<i>I am a Yankee Doodle boy</i>

1177
01:29:39,107 --> 01:29:42,508
- Come in.
- Oh, Tommy, they're beautiful.

1178
01:29:42,677 --> 01:29:45,942
- Maybe I should have got a dozen more.
- No, one would have been enough.

1179
01:29:46,114 --> 01:29:49,083
Once, you told me I was
gonna be dancing on top of the world...

1180
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:53,880
...and tonight, I'm all filled up with things
I've been saving to say...

1181
01:29:54,055 --> 01:29:57,718
...but now that the time is here,
I guess I'll just go on and say them, huh?

1182
01:29:57,892 --> 01:30:00,793
But, Tommy... oh, no, don't go.
I want to thank you too.

1183
01:30:00,962 --> 01:30:03,453
You've done so much and...

1184
01:30:03,631 --> 01:30:06,099
...I guess I'll never be happier
than I am tonight.

1185
01:30:06,968 --> 01:30:12,497
- Hey, Tommy, your mother's here.
- Oh, Mom! How are you?

1186
01:30:12,673 --> 01:30:15,938
Wait a minute. What are you doing,
working your way through college?

1187
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:18,908
I bought them all on the train.
I was saving them for you.

1188
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:21,378
You've grown a little, haven't you?

1189
01:30:21,549 --> 01:30:23,744
Mom, I'd like you
to meet some of my friends.

1190
01:30:23,918 --> 01:30:27,615
No, no, no. Don't tell me.
This is Penny, of course.

1191
01:30:27,789 --> 01:30:30,553
I'm awful glad to meet you.
How'd you know it was me?

1192
01:30:30,725 --> 01:30:34,024
Tommy writes
such wonderful descriptions.

1193
01:30:34,195 --> 01:30:38,188
- And of course, this is Hammy.
- No, Mom, that's Ray.

1194
01:30:38,366 --> 01:30:40,334
In back of you, that's Hammy.

1195
01:30:40,501 --> 01:30:44,198
- Of course, the one with the blank verse.
- That's him.

1196
01:30:44,372 --> 01:30:46,067
- Fifteen minutes.
- I've got to go.

1197
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:50,233
Excuse me. I'll see you after the show.
And here. This is for recognizing me.

1198
01:30:50,411 --> 01:30:53,175
You go on out and get your seat now.
See you after the show.

1199
01:30:53,347 --> 01:30:55,144
You come back, if you'll talk to me.

1200
01:30:55,316 --> 01:30:59,616
Here it is, son, this wonderful minute,
just as we talked about it so many times.

1201
01:30:59,787 --> 01:31:02,381
Yeah, sort of jumped up
on top of us, huh?

1202
01:31:02,557 --> 01:31:05,856
Yes, and the funniest thing is
I'm not the least bit nervous.

1203
01:31:06,027 --> 01:31:08,791
No, no, of course, you're not.
Of course, you're not. Here.

1204
01:31:08,963 --> 01:31:10,624
Give me a kiss for good luck, huh?

1205
01:31:10,798 --> 01:31:12,060
- You got your tickets?
- Yes.

1206
01:31:12,233 --> 01:31:14,497
- I'll see you after the show. Bye.
- All right.

1207
01:31:14,669 --> 01:31:16,603
Gosh, what a peach of a mom, huh?

1208
01:31:16,771 --> 01:31:20,400
- I wish Jonesy and Reed would get here.
- Don't worry, Jonesy won't let us down.

1209
01:31:20,575 --> 01:31:22,600
- You think he'll go for us?
- He'll go for us.

1210
01:31:22,777 --> 01:31:24,870
I hope they don't leave
before our big number.

1211
01:31:25,046 --> 01:31:29,005
With Jonesy on one side and mom on the
other, I'm taking the short end of the bet.

1212
01:31:29,183 --> 01:31:31,151
- Ten minutes.
- Hey, we'd better hurry.

1213
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:34,311
I'm gonna go out front and
see the house, huh? Be right back.

1214
01:31:35,756 --> 01:31:40,250
- Mr. Williams, how do I look?
- You look swell, Barbara Jo.

1215
01:31:40,428 --> 01:31:42,589
- Good luck to you.
- Thanks.

1216
01:31:46,634 --> 01:31:51,401
Tommy Williams. My boy.
Acting since he was that high.

1217
01:31:53,007 --> 01:31:54,235
- Tommy. Hey, Tommy.
- Yeah?

1218
01:31:54,408 --> 01:31:58,037
- She's here. Jones.
- Oh, swell. Excuse me, Maria.

1219
01:31:58,212 --> 01:32:00,840
Jonesy, am I glad to see you.
Where is he?

1220
01:32:01,015 --> 01:32:02,676
- He's not here, Tommy.
- Not here?

1221
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:04,283
I'm terribly sorry, Tommy.

1222
01:32:04,452 --> 01:32:06,682
Does that mean he's not coming?
You promised us...

1223
01:32:06,854 --> 01:32:09,687
I know I promised you, Tommy,
but I just couldn't ask him.

1224
01:32:09,857 --> 01:32:12,087
The poor guy is going crazy
in Philadelphia.

1225
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:15,286
The show isn't doing any business.
They're rewriting, recasting.

1226
01:32:15,463 --> 01:32:17,488
On top of all that, he twisted his ankle.

1227
01:32:17,665 --> 01:32:19,929
I had to sneak out of town myself.

1228
01:32:20,101 --> 01:32:23,502
Never mind, we'll put the show on,
it'll be great and he'll hear about it.

1229
01:32:23,671 --> 01:32:25,195
- Won't he, Jonesy?
- Overture's in.

1230
01:32:25,373 --> 01:32:27,603
Come on, Tommy, you're gonna be late.
Hurry up.

1231
01:32:27,775 --> 01:32:31,006
Everybody, come here for a minute.
Come on around me.

1232
01:32:31,178 --> 01:32:33,738
Come on. Wait a minute.
I got something to tell you.

1233
01:32:33,915 --> 01:32:37,544
This is the first time in years that
the curtain's gone up in the old Duchess.

1234
01:32:37,718 --> 01:32:40,084
Let's make them glad
they didn't tear it down, huh?

1235
01:32:40,254 --> 01:32:42,984
What do you say?
Come on, places, everybody!

1236
01:32:59,907 --> 01:33:02,774
<i>- Run for your lives!
- Stay where you are!</i>

1237
01:33:02,944 --> 01:33:05,435
<i>- Make a lot of noise!
- Keep still!</i>

1238
01:33:05,613 --> 01:33:11,279
<i>A bombshell just fell over Brazil</i>

1239
01:33:11,786 --> 01:33:14,550
<i>- Lay down your arms
- Run up your flags</i>

1240
01:33:14,722 --> 01:33:17,190
<i>You'll surrender to this jill</i>

1241
01:33:17,358 --> 01:33:21,488
<i>This bombshell that fell over Brazil</i>

1242
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:28,295
<i>Her contribution
To the art of elocution</i>

1243
01:33:28,469 --> 01:33:34,430
<i>Is apt to start a revolution
Among the ladies at the Ritz</i>

1244
01:33:34,842 --> 01:33:40,371
<i>In Rio de Janeiro
When she sings "Mamae Eu Quero"</i>

1245
01:33:40,548 --> 01:33:46,919
<i>Every local caballero
Admits that it's a blitz</i>

1246
01:33:47,254 --> 01:33:50,189
<i>So give up the ship
Throw in the sponge</i>

1247
01:33:50,358 --> 01:33:53,020
<i>Get ready for a great big thrill</i>

1248
01:33:53,194 --> 01:33:58,461
<i>For here comes
That bombshell from Brazil</i>

1249
01:35:01,762 --> 01:35:03,195
Hey, Ma!

1250
01:35:06,067 --> 01:35:07,329
- How was it?
- Sensational.

1251
01:35:07,501 --> 01:35:10,493
- You murdered them.
- Come on, we only got a minute to change.

1252
01:35:10,671 --> 01:35:12,502
I was nervous.
I forgot the second chorus.

1253
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:15,331
- You were great. Keep on being nervous.
- Don't forget...

1254
01:35:15,509 --> 01:35:18,307
- Who's Tommy Williams?
- I am.

1255
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:21,812
I'm Inspector Moriarity.
Who are these two apples?

1256
01:35:21,982 --> 01:35:23,643
- They're my partners.
- Your partners?

1257
01:35:23,818 --> 01:35:25,251
What do you think you're doing?

1258
01:35:25,419 --> 01:35:28,183
We're in the middle of a number.
We're on stage in a minute.

1259
01:35:28,355 --> 01:35:30,380
- Come back around...
- Slow down, Mr. Ziegfeld.

1260
01:35:30,558 --> 01:35:32,822
- You ain't putting on any show.
- What do you mean?

1261
01:35:33,027 --> 01:35:34,824
- We're not putting on a show?
- Who says?

1262
01:35:34,995 --> 01:35:38,396
State of New York, City of New York,
board of health, and fire commission.

1263
01:35:38,566 --> 01:35:39,555
Shall I go on?

1264
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:43,192
We're putting on a show. People
bought tickets. They're out in front now.

1265
01:35:43,370 --> 01:35:46,430
That's what I'm talking about.
You can't lock people in a firetrap.

1266
01:35:46,607 --> 01:35:48,575
This theatre's been condemned
for 15 years.

1267
01:35:48,743 --> 01:35:50,267
- I don't believe it.
- It's a plot.

1268
01:35:50,444 --> 01:35:54,312
Mr. Moriarity, you can't stop the show.
Please, don't stop it.

1269
01:35:54,482 --> 01:35:57,315
- Fifty little kids that never saw the sunlight.
- With rickets.

1270
01:35:57,485 --> 01:36:00,545
We've worked day and night like dogs,
like slaves. My mother, she...

1271
01:36:00,721 --> 01:36:03,189
I know all about the kids
and I've got a mother too...

1272
01:36:03,357 --> 01:36:07,919
...but if that audience isn't out of there in
15 minutes, I'll have to call the 8th Precinct.

1273
01:36:08,095 --> 01:36:11,861
- Mr. Moriarity, couldn't you...?
- I'm sorry, fellas, I know how you feel.

1274
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:15,468
I almost was in a show myself once.

1275
01:36:29,483 --> 01:36:33,214
- Tommy. Tommy!
- Come in.

1276
01:36:33,387 --> 01:36:35,981
Come on. The orchestra's played
your cue three times.

1277
01:36:36,157 --> 01:36:38,216
Aren't you coming out on the stage?

1278
01:36:38,392 --> 01:36:43,830
Yeah, I'm coming out.

1279
01:36:43,998 --> 01:36:46,694
Bet I get a million laughs too.

1280
01:37:00,981 --> 01:37:02,846
Ladies and gentlemen...

1281
01:37:03,484 --> 01:37:08,717
...l'm terribly sorry,
but something unexpected has come up...

1282
01:37:08,889 --> 01:37:11,858
...and we will not be able
to continue the show.

1283
01:37:12,993 --> 01:37:18,397
It's some fire regulation or something
like that, something we knew nothing about.

1284
01:37:19,233 --> 01:37:23,795
And I'm awfully sorry that
we can't give the show...

1285
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:29,632
...because it's really a wonderful show
and I'm sure that you would have all liked it.

1286
01:37:29,810 --> 01:37:35,214
Anyhow, we want to thank each and
every one of you for coming here...

1287
01:37:35,382 --> 01:37:38,977
...and having faith in us and trying to
help the send the kids to the country.

1288
01:37:40,154 --> 01:37:42,554
Everybody did their best.

1289
01:37:43,924 --> 01:37:49,226
So if you will stop by the box office
on your way out...

1290
01:37:49,463 --> 01:37:53,524
...why, your money will
be cheerfully refunded. Thank you.

1291
01:38:27,268 --> 01:38:30,897
Tommy, don't eat your heart out.

1292
01:38:31,071 --> 01:38:33,665
You did the best you could
and we're awful proud of you.

1293
01:38:33,841 --> 01:38:37,800
Yeah. Everybody did their best
and where did it get us?

1294
01:38:37,978 --> 01:38:39,570
Right out in left field.

1295
01:38:39,747 --> 01:38:42,580
No, don't help yourself,
help everybody else.

1296
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:46,550
Be a Santa Claus, make sacrifices.
If you can do that for the rest of your life...

1297
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:50,281
...you'll be a big success,
when you're about 165 years old.

1298
01:38:50,457 --> 01:38:52,584
- Tommy, you don't mean that.
- You can bet I do.

1299
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:55,228
Where did it get us?
No money for the kids, no show...

1300
01:38:55,396 --> 01:38:58,092
...chance with Thornton Reed
blown right out of the window.

1301
01:38:58,265 --> 01:39:00,665
Tommy, you mustn't let it make you bitter,
please.

1302
01:39:00,834 --> 01:39:02,301
Faith, hope and charity.

1303
01:39:02,469 --> 01:39:06,098
Take those kids and wrap them in cellophane
and give them back to the Indians.

1304
01:39:06,273 --> 01:39:08,070
From now on, it's the old rules for me.

1305
01:39:08,242 --> 01:39:10,267
I'll get a chance again.
When I do, look out.

1306
01:39:10,444 --> 01:39:13,902
Because I'm gonna take anything
from anybody, at any time, any place.

1307
01:39:14,081 --> 01:39:16,174
- Tommy, l...
- No.

1308
01:39:30,331 --> 01:39:33,266
Mr. Williams.
They didn't take it. They didn't take it.

1309
01:39:33,434 --> 01:39:36,426
- Didn't take what?
- Come on, you tell him, Mr. Stone, tell him.

1310
01:39:36,603 --> 01:39:39,367
Tommy, it's amazing.
Everybody went right by the box office.

1311
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:42,805
- They wouldn't take their money back.
- Some of them gave money besides.

1312
01:39:42,977 --> 01:39:45,946
Seven hundred and forty dollars.

1313
01:39:47,214 --> 01:39:50,081
Isn't it wonderful?
We got all the money to go to the country.

1314
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:53,014
Now there's no need for putting
on a show at all.

1315
01:39:54,421 --> 01:39:59,620
Yeah. You're right.

1316
01:40:00,894 --> 01:40:03,829
There's no need in putting
a show on at all.

1317
01:40:04,565 --> 01:40:05,759
Tommy.

1318
01:40:09,303 --> 01:40:11,828
Mr. Stone, there's something
I'd like to say.

1319
01:40:12,006 --> 01:40:15,737
I know that the main purpose is getting
Barbara Jo and the kids to the country...

1320
01:40:15,909 --> 01:40:19,174
...but there's something else
that we have to take into consideration.

1321
01:40:19,346 --> 01:40:23,146
Tommy and his friends gave up
a lot more than most of you know about.

1322
01:40:23,317 --> 01:40:27,014
Getting this show on to them
is just as important as going to the country.

1323
01:40:27,187 --> 01:40:29,087
So I think that it would be fair...

1324
01:40:29,256 --> 01:40:32,657
...if we let him decide if he wants
to use this money to hire a theatre...

1325
01:40:32,826 --> 01:40:35,795
...and get his chance
to put the show on.

1326
01:40:35,963 --> 01:40:42,960
And they can go to the country later on,
maybe next year.

1327
01:40:43,737 --> 01:40:49,232
Well, I don't know what to say.
What do you think, Josephine?

1328
01:40:49,576 --> 01:40:53,979
Well, I suppose if it's fair.

1329
01:40:54,348 --> 01:40:58,409
Sure, we can go later on.

1330
01:41:02,222 --> 01:41:04,588
You'd give this to me?

1331
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:09,120
Sure, if it's fair.

1332
01:41:13,834 --> 01:41:15,495
No, Jo.

1333
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:20,529
You're not only going to the country,
but you're leaving tomorrow morning.

1334
01:41:20,707 --> 01:41:24,040
- Mr. Williams.
- Splendid.

1335
01:41:27,214 --> 01:41:31,742
Where are they? It's ridiculous, fantastic
fabulous. I absolutely can't believe it.

1336
01:41:31,919 --> 01:41:34,615
I want to find how anyone
could do a thing like this to me.

1337
01:41:34,788 --> 01:41:37,018
- Where are they?
- Thornton. It's Thornton.

1338
01:41:37,191 --> 01:41:42,094
- Mr. Reed? I thought he was in Philadelphia.
- Run, don't walk, to the nearest exit.

1339
01:41:42,396 --> 01:41:45,923
Who'd...? There you are!

1340
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:48,967
I knew you had a hand in this fiasco.

1341
01:41:49,136 --> 01:41:51,297
Now, Thornton, don't get excited.
We only...

1342
01:41:51,472 --> 01:41:55,431
I've got a $ 100,000 turkey
in Philadelphia and what do I get?

1343
01:41:55,609 --> 01:41:59,238
Fire commission, board of health,
police department, warrants for my arrest!

1344
01:41:59,413 --> 01:42:03,747
Thornton, I'm terribly sorry, it's all my fault.
But there's no harm done.

1345
01:42:03,917 --> 01:42:07,683
No harm done? They bring me back to town
as though I were a criminal!

1346
01:42:07,855 --> 01:42:09,117
I thought they were crazy.

1347
01:42:09,289 --> 01:42:12,087
A show in my own theatre
and I don't even know it.

1348
01:42:12,426 --> 01:42:16,760
Thornton, unravel. There isn't any show
and there isn't going to be one.

1349
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:18,227
<i>Wait a minute, maybe...</i>

1350
01:42:19,099 --> 01:42:23,058
Mr. Reed, will you listen to me
for just a minute?

1351
01:42:23,237 --> 01:42:25,262
Mr. Reed, I'm so glad you're here.

1352
01:42:25,439 --> 01:42:27,999
It's against the law
to put our show on for an audience.

1353
01:42:28,175 --> 01:42:31,440
There's no law against putting it on for you.
You didn't buy a ticket!

1354
01:42:31,612 --> 01:42:33,944
Now she wants to sell me a ticket!

1355
01:42:34,114 --> 01:42:35,638
- Mason?
- Yes, sir.

1356
01:42:35,816 --> 01:42:39,547
No, no, Mr. Reed, dear Mr. Reed,
we spent weeks and weeks.

1357
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:42,780
We gave up everything.
All we want you to do is just sit down.

1358
01:42:42,956 --> 01:42:45,789
I've got trouble enough
without amateur...!

1359
01:42:46,393 --> 01:42:48,054
- Quick, Tommy, get them ready.
- Yeah.

1360
01:42:48,228 --> 01:42:51,664
Bring the curtain down. Mr. Morris, hurry.
Get the orchestra in the pit.

1361
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:55,366
Please, just watch this one number,
especially Tommy Williams.

1362
01:42:55,536 --> 01:42:57,970
And I give you my word of honor,
it won't hurt a bit.

1363
01:42:58,138 --> 01:43:00,538
Come on, Daddy, the overture.

1364
01:43:06,947 --> 01:43:11,782
<i>Here we are, six characters
Depressed and melancholy</i>

1365
01:43:11,952 --> 01:43:16,753
<i>Here we are, six characters
In search of a finale</i>

1366
01:43:16,924 --> 01:43:21,156
<i>We've racked our brains
And taxed our minds</i>

1367
01:43:21,328 --> 01:43:25,560
<i>To find a trick that's new</i>

1368
01:43:25,732 --> 01:43:32,729
<i>But still we haven't got
The slightest idea what to do</i>

1369
01:43:34,041 --> 01:43:38,535
<i>We might try a Russian ballet
But a ballet might disclose</i>

1370
01:43:38,712 --> 01:43:43,911
<i>That I am more athletic
Than aesthetic on my toes</i>

1371
01:43:44,084 --> 01:43:48,180
<i>Say, how about a circus?
We could all go acrobatic</i>

1372
01:43:48,355 --> 01:43:54,851
<i>Now, here's a trick I learned in school
To strengthen my sciatic</i>

1373
01:43:56,129 --> 01:44:02,398
<i>We could all go South American
And cut a South American rug</i>

1374
01:44:02,569 --> 01:44:07,097
<i>But I'd never arrive
I ain't hep to their jive</i>

1375
01:44:07,274 --> 01:44:11,540
<i>I'm just a Brooklyn jitterbug</i>

1376
01:44:12,479 --> 01:44:17,314
<i>Hold everything... I've got it, pals
Let's do an aquacade</i>

1377
01:44:17,484 --> 01:44:23,787
<i>It's true that I can't swim a stroke
But you ought to see me wade</i>

1378
01:44:24,491 --> 01:44:29,724
<i>What's wrong with doing something old?
Something tried and true</i>

1379
01:44:29,896 --> 01:44:35,232
<i>Well, how about a minstrel show?
Does that appeal to you?</i>

1380
01:44:35,402 --> 01:44:38,530
<i>A good old-fashioned minstrel show</i>

1381
01:44:38,705 --> 01:44:42,106
<i>- That suits us
- Well, then let's go!</i>

1382
01:44:42,276 --> 01:44:45,541
<i>Go and tell New York
To grab a piece of cork</i>

1383
01:44:45,712 --> 01:44:48,647
<i>And join that blackout over Broadway</i>

1384
01:44:49,416 --> 01:44:52,249
<i>Everybody's gonna be dancin' on air</i>

1385
01:44:52,419 --> 01:44:55,286
<i>When they hear them
Playing "Swanee River" in Times Square</i>

1386
01:44:55,455 --> 01:44:58,549
<i>Every southern lass
Is gonna cook with gas</i>

1387
01:44:58,725 --> 01:45:01,717
<i>And boy, that southern cookin's okay</i>

1388
01:45:01,895 --> 01:45:08,061
<i>And when you hear that moan
On the slide trombone</i>

1389
01:45:08,235 --> 01:45:13,935
<i>You'll wanna black up
For that blackout over Broadway</i>

1390
01:45:14,641 --> 01:45:17,667
<i>Go and tell the town
They ought to come on down</i>

1391
01:45:17,844 --> 01:45:21,575
<i>And join that blackout over Broadway</i>

1392
01:45:21,748 --> 01:45:24,273
<i>You'll see Andrew Jackson Brown
Straight from the south</i>

1393
01:45:24,451 --> 01:45:27,579
<i>And if he don't entertain you
You can shut my mouth</i>

1394
01:45:27,754 --> 01:45:30,587
<i>There'll be so much fun
That long before we're done</i>

1395
01:45:30,757 --> 01:45:33,783
<i>Those angels up in heaven will say</i>

1396
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:40,195
<i>"Ain't got no time to stall
Spread your wings, you all</i>

1397
01:45:40,367 --> 01:45:45,361
<i>And start to black up
For that blackout over Broadway"</i>

1398
01:46:39,159 --> 01:46:42,390
<i>Every southern lass
Is gonna cook with gas</i>

1399
01:46:42,562 --> 01:46:45,531
<i>And boy, that southern cookin's okay</i>

1400
01:46:45,699 --> 01:46:52,195
<i>And when you hear that moan
On the slide trombone</i>

1401
01:46:52,372 --> 01:46:58,868
<i>You'll wanna black up
For that blackout over Broadway!</i>

1402
01:46:59,579 --> 01:47:02,070
Gentlemen, be seated.

1403
01:47:07,821 --> 01:47:11,313
<i>Mr. Tambo, Mr. Tambo
How do you do?</i>

1404
01:47:11,491 --> 01:47:14,255
<i>And incidentally, how do you feel?</i>

1405
01:47:14,428 --> 01:47:19,695
<i>Well, now, I feels just like a stovepipe
Nothing else, buddy</i>

1406
01:47:19,866 --> 01:47:21,629
<i>You feels just like a stovepipe?</i>

1407
01:47:21,802 --> 01:47:24,703
<i>Yeah, sooty</i>

1408
01:47:30,811 --> 01:47:34,577
<i>Now, Mr. Bones, Mr. Bones
It's good to see you</i>

1409
01:47:34,748 --> 01:47:37,808
<i>And incidentally, Mr. Bones
How do you feel?</i>

1410
01:47:37,984 --> 01:47:39,315
<i>How does I feel?</i>

1411
01:47:39,486 --> 01:47:42,387
<i>Well, man, I feels just like
A fireplace here of late</i>

1412
01:47:42,556 --> 01:47:44,524
<i>You say you feels just like a fireplace?</i>

1413
01:47:44,691 --> 01:47:47,353
<i>I said it, I feels grate</i>

1414
01:47:54,835 --> 01:47:58,464
<i>We all expect some dancing
When the minstrels come to town</i>

1415
01:47:58,638 --> 01:48:01,539
<i>So now may I present to you</i>

1416
01:48:01,708 --> 01:48:06,441
<i>Mr. Rufus Rastus Jefferson Davis Brown</i>

1417
01:48:14,387 --> 01:48:20,883
<i>By the light of the silvery moon</i>

1418
01:48:21,294 --> 01:48:25,060
<i>I want to spoon
By the light of the moon</i>

1419
01:48:25,232 --> 01:48:29,999
<i>To my honey, I'll croon love's tune</i>

1420
01:48:30,170 --> 01:48:36,666
<i>Honey moon, keep a-shinin' in June
The month of June</i>

1421
01:48:37,043 --> 01:48:40,843
<i>Your silvery beams
Will bring love's dreams</i>

1422
01:48:41,014 --> 01:48:44,814
<i>We'll be cuddlin' soon
Oh, make it soon</i>

1423
01:48:44,985 --> 01:48:48,182
<i>By the silvery moon</i>

1424
01:49:04,971 --> 01:49:07,531
<i>By the silvery moon</i>

1425
01:49:11,144 --> 01:49:14,204
<i>By the silvery moon</i>

1426
01:49:18,385 --> 01:49:22,048
<i>Oh, Mr. Interlocutor
Could there be something wrong?</i>

1427
01:49:22,222 --> 01:49:25,714
<i>We are waiting just
To hear Mr. Tambo do his song</i>

1428
01:49:25,892 --> 01:49:29,055
<i>Mr. Tambo
Do you feel good and strong?</i>

1429
01:49:29,229 --> 01:49:35,395
<i>Then get right up and show the folks
How you can sing that song</i>

1430
01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:40,529
<i>I hear tell there's a stranger
In the Jones household</i>

1431
01:49:40,707 --> 01:49:43,835
<i>- Yes, sirree, yes, sirree
- That's what I'm told</i>

1432
01:49:44,010 --> 01:49:47,707
<i>I hear tell there's a new arrival
Six days old</i>

1433
01:49:47,881 --> 01:49:50,645
<i>- Yes, sirree, yes, sirree
- Worth his wait in gold</i>

1434
01:49:50,817 --> 01:49:54,218
<i>Come right in
And meet the son</i>

1435
01:49:54,387 --> 01:49:58,221
<i>Christening's done
Time to have some fun</i>

1436
01:49:58,391 --> 01:50:01,792
<i>- Yes, sirree, yes, sirree
- Yes, sirree</i>

1437
01:50:01,962 --> 01:50:04,192
<i>Yes, sirree, yes, sirree</i>

1438
01:50:04,364 --> 01:50:07,925
<i>It's a big holiday everywhere</i>

1439
01:50:08,101 --> 01:50:11,434
<i>For the Jones family
Has a brand-new heir</i>

1440
01:50:11,605 --> 01:50:14,870
<i>He's a joy, heaven-sent
And we proudly present</i>

1441
01:50:15,041 --> 01:50:18,499
<i>Mr. Franklin D. Roosevelt Jones</i>

1442
01:50:18,678 --> 01:50:22,045
<i>When he grows up
He never will stray</i>

1443
01:50:22,215 --> 01:50:25,616
<i>With a name
Like the one that he's got today</i>

1444
01:50:25,785 --> 01:50:28,117
<i>When he walks down the street
Folks will say</i>

1445
01:50:28,288 --> 01:50:33,225
<i>"Pleased to meet
Mr. Franklin D. Roosevelt Jones "</i>

1446
01:50:33,393 --> 01:50:36,123
<i>What a smile
And how he shows it</i>

1447
01:50:36,296 --> 01:50:40,198
<i>He'll be happy all day long</i>

1448
01:50:40,367 --> 01:50:43,234
<i>What a name
I'll bet he knows it</i>

1449
01:50:43,403 --> 01:50:47,339
<i>With that handle
How can he go wrong?</i>

1450
01:50:47,507 --> 01:50:50,567
<i>And the folks in the town all agree</i>

1451
01:50:50,744 --> 01:50:54,145
<i>He'll be famous
As famous as he can be</i>

1452
01:50:54,314 --> 01:50:57,806
<i>How can he be a dud
Or a stick-in-the-mud</i>

1453
01:50:57,984 --> 01:51:01,943
<i>When he's Franklin D. Roosevelt Jones?</i>

1454
01:51:02,122 --> 01:51:04,955
<i>Go to sleep, my baby</i>

1455
01:51:05,125 --> 01:51:08,754
<i>And maybe you'll balance the budget
By and by</i>

1456
01:51:08,928 --> 01:51:15,424
<i>Oh, you're a lucky baby
With Franklin D. For your name</i>

1457
01:51:15,602 --> 01:51:19,038
<i>Mrs. Jones' baby boy
Is a welcome resident</i>

1458
01:51:19,205 --> 01:51:22,538
<i>Give him a fishing rod for a toy
He's the future president</i>

1459
01:51:22,709 --> 01:51:26,042
<i>When this rascal goes to school
ABC's won't matter</i>

1460
01:51:26,212 --> 01:51:29,375
<i>Teach him plain old 'rithmetic
And of course, some fireside chatter</i>

1461
01:51:29,549 --> 01:51:36,352
<i>My friends, my friends
Let's all shout hooray!</i>

1462
01:51:36,523 --> 01:51:39,788
<i>It's a big holiday everywhere</i>

1463
01:51:39,959 --> 01:51:43,622
<i>For the Jones family
Has a brand-new heir</i>

1464
01:51:43,797 --> 01:51:47,255
<i>We'll be proud to affirm
When he serves his fourth term</i>

1465
01:51:47,434 --> 01:51:48,833
<i>- Just you wait and see
- Yeah!</i>

1466
01:51:49,002 --> 01:51:50,560
<i>- He'll make history
- Yeah!</i>

1467
01:51:50,737 --> 01:51:57,734
<i>'Cause he's Franklin D. Roosevelt Jones!</i>

1468
01:52:02,982 --> 01:52:07,851
<i>Oh, ring, ring the banjo
For Franklin Roosevelt Jones</i>

1469
01:52:08,021 --> 01:52:11,218
<i>But when you hear the banjo</i>

1470
01:52:11,391 --> 01:52:17,330
<i>It's played by Mr. Bones</i>

1471
01:54:53,887 --> 01:54:57,186
<i>Way down on the levee
In old Alabamy</i>

1472
01:54:57,357 --> 01:55:00,349
<i>There's Daddy and Mammy
There's Ephraim and Sammy</i>

1473
01:55:00,526 --> 01:55:04,155
<i>On a moonlight night
You can find them all</i>

1474
01:55:04,330 --> 01:55:07,322
<i>While they are waitin'
The banjos are syncopatin'</i>

1475
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:10,697
<i>Oh, what's that they're sayin'?
Oh, what's that they're sayin'?</i>

1476
01:55:10,870 --> 01:55:13,805
<i>While they keep playin'
And hummin' and swayin'</i>

1477
01:55:13,973 --> 01:55:20,037
<i>It's the good ship Robert E. Lee
That's here to carry the cotton away</i>

1478
01:55:20,213 --> 01:55:26,709
<i>Watch them shufflin' along
See them shufflin' along</i>

1479
01:55:26,886 --> 01:55:30,322
<i>Go take your best gal
Your real pal</i>

1480
01:55:30,490 --> 01:55:33,618
<i>Go down on the levee
I said to the levee</i>

1481
01:55:33,793 --> 01:55:39,959
<i>And we'll join that shufflin' throng
Hear that music and song</i>

1482
01:55:40,133 --> 01:55:43,660
<i>It's simply great, mate
Waitin' on the levee</i>

1483
01:55:43,836 --> 01:55:46,999
<i>Waitin' for the Robert E. Lee!</i>

1484
01:56:31,918 --> 01:56:34,113
<i>We're babes on Broadway</i>

1485
01:56:34,287 --> 01:56:39,589
<i>We're goin' places
When our new faces appear</i>

1486
01:56:39,759 --> 01:56:43,490
<i>It's a wonderful street
For babes like us to be on</i>

1487
01:56:43,663 --> 01:56:47,429
<i>We're here because
We want our names in neon</i>

1488
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:51,092
<i>We left Topeka
We left Eureka</i>

1489
01:56:51,270 --> 01:56:54,637
<i>And came to seek a career</i>

1490
01:56:54,807 --> 01:56:58,368
<i>Oh, we're milkin' applause
Instead of milkin' a cow</i>

1491
01:56:58,544 --> 01:57:03,982
<i>'Cause we're babes on Broadway now!</i>
