1
00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:02,616
Thanks for waiting,
Miss Pierce.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,217
Please, just call me Brittany.

3
00:00:04,252 --> 00:00:05,202
Brittany,

4
00:00:05,253 --> 00:00:07,370
this is Dr. Leonard Hauptman.

5
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:09,289
I am Dr. Donald Langdon,

6
00:00:09,323 --> 00:00:12,125
the dean of the mathematics
department here at MIT.

7
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:13,960
Brittany,

8
00:00:13,995 --> 00:00:16,463
when MIT heard about your
near-perfect SAT score,

9
00:00:16,497 --> 00:00:17,964
we were a little skeptical.

10
00:00:17,998 --> 00:00:19,299
A 0.2 grade point

11
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:23,169
is practically unheard of.

12
00:00:23,204 --> 00:00:24,871
That means you've
never gotten higher

13
00:00:24,906 --> 00:00:25,906
than a D-minus.

14
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,390
Is that why I had to take

15
00:00:27,441 --> 00:00:28,642
that math test this morning?

16
00:00:28,676 --> 00:00:33,012
We needed to see for ourselves

17
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,232
if you were MIT material.

18
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:36,233
And how did I do?

19
00:00:36,284 --> 00:00:37,567
You scored a zero.

20
00:00:37,618 --> 00:00:39,903
Brittany, you lack
a basic understanding

21
00:00:39,954 --> 00:00:41,755
of even the simplest arithmetic,

22
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:43,406
and I don't know why
you couldn't have used

23
00:00:43,457 --> 00:00:45,024
a number-two pencil,
like we asked.

24
00:00:45,042 --> 00:00:47,661
Filling out the ovals in crayon

25
00:00:47,695 --> 00:00:49,212
broke our Scantron machine.

26
00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:51,164
I'm sorry.
However,

27
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:56,336
we would like to ask you
about these numbers

28
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,338
that you scribbled
on the back of your test.

29
00:00:58,372 --> 00:00:59,673
Yeah.

30
00:00:59,707 --> 00:01:01,007
I don't know.

31
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,559
I didn't know any of the answers
on the test, so...

32
00:01:02,593 --> 00:01:05,228
I had all these numbers swirling
around in my head,

33
00:01:05,263 --> 00:01:07,397
so I just decided
to write them all down

34
00:01:07,431 --> 00:01:09,099
so my brain would stop
feeling so tickly.

35
00:01:11,552 --> 00:01:13,236
Jill.

36
00:01:15,606 --> 00:01:19,192
Brittany, this is no ordinary
series of numbers.

37
00:01:19,226 --> 00:01:21,528
When you start
in the upper left-hand corner

38
00:01:21,562 --> 00:01:23,079
and read it from left to right,

39
00:01:23,114 --> 00:01:24,080
it's a prime number.

40
00:01:24,115 --> 00:01:25,248
Okay.

41
00:01:25,283 --> 00:01:26,733
Normally you'd need
a supercomputer

42
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:28,201
to find a prime number
that large.

43
00:01:28,235 --> 00:01:30,537
Totes.
But when you start

44
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:32,622
from the upper right
and read it from right to left,

45
00:01:32,673 --> 00:01:34,457
you get Avogadro's constant.

46
00:01:34,508 --> 00:01:36,376
Sweet.
But that's not even

47
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,544
the most amazing part.

48
00:01:37,578 --> 00:01:39,462
When you start
in the lower left-hand corner

49
00:01:39,513 --> 00:01:41,631
and read the number
counterclockwise,

50
00:01:41,682 --> 00:01:43,550
you get Planck's constant,

51
00:01:43,584 --> 00:01:45,769
which is the fundamental unit

52
00:01:45,803 --> 00:01:49,306
of measurement
in quantum mechanics.

53
00:01:49,357 --> 00:01:51,057
We-we don't even know
what it means.

54
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:52,392
We believe

55
00:01:52,426 --> 00:01:55,562
that what we are now calling
the Brittany Code...

56
00:01:55,596 --> 00:01:56,563
The Brittany Code.

57
00:01:56,597 --> 00:01:57,614
...will go
down in history

58
00:01:57,648 --> 00:01:59,232
as the most important

59
00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:01,951
scientific breakthrough
of the 21st century.

60
00:02:01,986 --> 00:02:03,453
Oh, my God.

61
00:02:03,487 --> 00:02:04,788
That is...

62
00:02:04,822 --> 00:02:06,606
totally a-amazing.

63
00:02:06,624 --> 00:02:08,575
I thought you were gonna tell me
that I was an idiot,

64
00:02:08,609 --> 00:02:10,293
and that's bullying,
and I won't tolerate that.

65
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:17,617
Brittany, it's possible
that you may be

66
00:02:17,635 --> 00:02:21,421
the most brilliant scientific
mind since Albert Einstein.

67
00:02:21,455 --> 00:02:23,006
No way.

68
00:02:23,057 --> 00:02:24,841
And that is why

69
00:02:24,892 --> 00:02:27,977
we here at MIT

70
00:02:28,012 --> 00:02:31,264
would like to present to you

71
00:02:31,298 --> 00:02:33,149
a very unusual proposition.

WILL:
All right, guys.

82
00:03:01,545 --> 00:03:02,962
It's finally here.

83
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:04,130
Regionals.

84
00:03:04,164 --> 00:03:05,348
(cheering)

85
00:03:05,383 --> 00:03:06,800
Yeah!
That's right!

86
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:08,184
WILL:
I just found out,

87
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:10,203
because of safety concerns
related to

88
00:03:10,237 --> 00:03:12,872
late-season tornados,
Indianapolis has declined

89
00:03:12,907 --> 00:03:13,973
to host the competition.

90
00:03:14,008 --> 00:03:15,959
So! As defending champions,

91
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:17,627
we're having regionals here,

92
00:03:17,661 --> 00:03:18,628
in our auditorium.

93
00:03:18,662 --> 00:03:19,712
Did you hear that?
Yes!

94
00:03:19,747 --> 00:03:21,965
Home court advantage,
yo! (Whoops)

95
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:24,084
Now, because of
a sexting scandal

96
00:03:24,118 --> 00:03:25,468
at Our Lady of Perpetual
Loneliness,

97
00:03:25,503 --> 00:03:27,637
their glee club,
the Nun-touchables,

98
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:29,556
has been excommunicated
by the new pope.

99
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,557
(murmuring)
They've been replaced

100
00:03:30,591 --> 00:03:31,641
by the world-famous

101
00:03:31,675 --> 00:03:33,393
boys of Ziegler Prep,

102
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:34,727
the Waffle-toots.

103
00:03:34,762 --> 00:03:36,646
Like cake farts?
They're very good.

104
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,731
The Hoosierdaddies are still
the odds-on favorite.

105
00:03:38,766 --> 00:03:40,767
I mean, their lead vocalist,
Frida Romero,

106
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:42,986
is a tiny juggernaut of talent.

107
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,939
We are in for
the fight of our lives.

108
00:03:45,973 --> 00:03:48,908
So... let's get real.

109
00:03:48,943 --> 00:03:50,844
<i>There comes a moment</i>
<i>in every performer's life</i>

110
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:52,529
<i>that defines him or her,</i>

111
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,581
<i>sometimes for</i>
<i>the rest of their career.</i>

112
00:03:54,615 --> 00:03:56,416
This is our moment.

113
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,751
We've struggled, we've endured,

114
00:03:58,786 --> 00:04:01,621
and now we must triumph.

115
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:02,956
<i>And speaking of that,</i>

116
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,175
<i>I want us all</i>
<i>to just take a moment</i>

117
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:06,876
<i>to send some positive energy</i>

118
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:08,261
<i>to one of our very own.</i>

119
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:11,164
She has her final callback
for <i>Funny Girl</i> today.

120
00:04:13,217 --> 00:04:14,350
Rachel Berry.

121
00:04:14,385 --> 00:04:16,469
We're ready for you.

122
00:04:16,503 --> 00:04:18,771
WILL: <i>So, let's all give a big</i>
<i>round of applause to Rachel,</i>

123
00:04:18,806 --> 00:04:20,190
<i>wherever she is.</i>

124
00:04:20,224 --> 00:04:22,859
(glee club applauding)

125
00:04:22,893 --> 00:04:24,394
Hi, I'm Rachel Berry,

126
00:04:24,428 --> 00:04:26,696
and I'll be auditioning for
the role of Fanny Brice today,

127
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,881
and I'll be singing.

128
00:04:27,915 --> 00:04:30,483
"To Love You More"
by Celine Dion.

129
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:32,518

Thank you, Rachel.

We'll let you know.

163
00:07:16,183 --> 00:07:18,151
(school bell ringing)

164
00:07:18,185 --> 00:07:19,869
You can only do this once,

165
00:07:19,903 --> 00:07:22,238
so it-it has to be perfect.

166
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:23,706
It has to be,
you know, special.

167
00:07:23,741 --> 00:07:26,159
Are you actually talking
about a marriage proposal?

168
00:07:26,193 --> 00:07:28,161
Dude, we're in high school.

169
00:07:28,195 --> 00:07:29,495
You're not ready
to get married,

170
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:30,630
and I'm not letting you.

171
00:07:30,664 --> 00:07:32,298
Well, I'm not asking
for your permission.

172
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,666
I'm already gonna do it.

173
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,802
What I'm asking for is your
help about how to do this.

174
00:07:35,836 --> 00:07:37,053
From my best friend.

175
00:07:37,087 --> 00:07:38,221
Okay.

176
00:07:38,255 --> 00:07:39,672
Then, as your best friend,
I need to remind you

177
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:41,591
that just a few weeks ago,
you were totally confused.

178
00:07:41,642 --> 00:07:43,309
You didn't even know where
Kurt stood with this Adam guy.

179
00:07:43,344 --> 00:07:45,311
Well, I don't remember
you being

180
00:07:45,346 --> 00:07:47,847
this introspective when you were
asking Brittany to marry you.

181
00:07:47,881 --> 00:07:51,067
One, I don't even know
what that means, and two,

182
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:52,268
we thought the world
was ending.

183
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,736
And when we realized
it wasn't...

184
00:07:53,771 --> 00:07:54,904
I regretted it.

185
00:07:54,938 --> 00:07:56,189
Will you listen to yourself?

186
00:07:56,223 --> 00:07:58,241
You sound exactly like
the rest of the world,

187
00:07:58,275 --> 00:07:59,525
saying that
"it's not time yet."

188
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:00,943
Well, you know what?

189
00:08:00,994 --> 00:08:02,412
People like me
have been hearing that

190
00:08:02,446 --> 00:08:04,247
for hundreds and
hundreds of years.

191
00:08:04,281 --> 00:08:05,581
This is happening.

192
00:08:05,616 --> 00:08:07,750
I am gonna ask Kurt
to marry me.

193
00:08:07,785 --> 00:08:10,253
And not only are you
one of my best friends,

194
00:08:10,287 --> 00:08:12,922
but I was kind of hoping
that you would be my best man.

195
00:08:12,956 --> 00:08:15,375
So let me know if you,
uh, change your mind.

196
00:08:18,128 --> 00:08:20,380
You know what? Someone has to do the
right thing here. Marley, stop...

197
00:08:20,414 --> 00:08:21,547
(whispers indistinctly) Jake...

198
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:23,883
...six, seven, eight, nine...

199
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:25,601
Uh, are, are Joe and Sugar here?

200
00:08:25,636 --> 00:08:28,271
Present, Mr. Shue.
(kids cheer)

201
00:08:28,305 --> 00:08:30,056
WILL:
Come on.

202
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,691
Sugar!
Great. Okay.

203
00:08:31,725 --> 00:08:34,227
Guys, I have finalized
our set list.

204
00:08:34,261 --> 00:08:36,279
We are going with "I Love It"
by Icona Pop...

205
00:08:36,313 --> 00:08:37,647
GIRL: I love it!
Yes.

206
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:39,449
"Hall of Fame" by The Script
and will. I.am.

207
00:08:39,483 --> 00:08:40,700
(kids cheer)

208
00:08:40,734 --> 00:08:43,486
And Marley's original song
"All or Nothing."

209
00:08:43,537 --> 00:08:45,288
(overlapping chatter)

210
00:08:45,322 --> 00:08:47,657
Hey, Mr. Shue, what
about <i>my</i> original song?

211
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:48,658
Do you remember?

212
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:50,243
♪ My cup, my cup

213
00:08:50,277 --> 00:08:51,711
♪ Sayin' "What's up?"

214
00:08:51,745 --> 00:08:53,129
♪ To my cup, my cup

215
00:08:53,163 --> 00:08:55,131
♪ More of a friend...
"My Cup" is one of a kind,

216
00:08:55,165 --> 00:08:56,549
but we're going
with Marley's song.

217
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,301
Oh, come on, boo.

218
00:08:58,335 --> 00:08:59,469
Two thumbs down.

219
00:08:59,503 --> 00:09:01,304
The only way to polish
that turd of a song

220
00:09:01,338 --> 00:09:03,055
is with my angelic alto voice.
Whoa.

221
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:06,142
So I demand to sing it
as a solo.

222
00:09:06,176 --> 00:09:09,896
And I demand to sing all
the good songs as solos.

223
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,681
Everyone can snap their fingers

224
00:09:11,732 --> 00:09:13,015
and march around behind me.

225
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:14,984
Tina, please make
an exact replica

226
00:09:15,018 --> 00:09:16,602
of Jennifer Lawrence's
Oscar dress.

227
00:09:16,636 --> 00:09:17,603
Um, no.

228
00:09:17,637 --> 00:09:18,938
Um... yes.

229
00:09:18,972 --> 00:09:20,273
Let me break it down.

230
00:09:20,307 --> 00:09:21,741
No one in this musty choir room

231
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:24,327
compares to my megawatt
star power.

232
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:26,162
Blaine, you're shorter
than your average lawn gnome.

233
00:09:26,196 --> 00:09:27,914
Joe, you look like
a Yucatán spider monkey.

234
00:09:27,948 --> 00:09:30,249
Tina is... you know,
she's... Tina.

235
00:09:30,284 --> 00:09:31,250
Wait, baby.
Baby, I love you,

236
00:09:31,285 --> 00:09:32,502
but you're really
out of line, here.

237
00:09:32,536 --> 00:09:33,669
And would you stop texting?

238
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:34,954
I'm trying to talk to you,
it's really rude.

239
00:09:34,988 --> 00:09:35,988
(phone rings)

240
00:09:38,258 --> 00:09:39,759
Did you seriously
just break up with me?

241
00:09:39,793 --> 00:09:40,793
By a text?

242
00:09:40,827 --> 00:09:42,628
Yeah.
As fascinated as I am

243
00:09:42,662 --> 00:09:44,347
by your down-filled,
pillow-soft lips

244
00:09:44,381 --> 00:09:46,349
that are ten times
too big for your face,

245
00:09:46,383 --> 00:09:48,017
I really miss my sweet,
sweet lady kisses.

246
00:09:48,051 --> 00:09:49,852
Sorry/not sorry.

247
00:09:49,887 --> 00:09:52,138
Moving on, I repeat:

248
00:09:52,172 --> 00:09:54,023
I require all the solos.

249
00:09:54,057 --> 00:09:56,058
That's just the way
it's gonna be.

250
00:09:57,394 --> 00:09:58,644
Brittany, why are
you doing this?

251
00:09:58,678 --> 00:10:00,897
Well, I'm just living
your lesson, Mr. Shue.

252
00:10:00,948 --> 00:10:02,148
It's all or nothing.

253
00:10:02,182 --> 00:10:04,834
All or nothing!
(sighs)

254
00:10:08,431 --> 00:10:09,398
(knocking) Come in!

255
00:10:09,432 --> 00:10:11,900
(knocking)

256
00:10:11,934 --> 00:10:13,435
I said, come in.
(pounding)

257
00:10:15,038 --> 00:10:16,405
What the hell are you doing?

258
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:18,707
I'm nailing my 95 theses
to the door.

259
00:10:18,742 --> 00:10:20,242
Your 95 what?

260
00:10:20,276 --> 00:10:22,544
They're 95 reasons
why I'm quitting the Cheerios!

261
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:25,664
"Number one. It is true
that members of the Cheerios!

262
00:10:25,715 --> 00:10:27,416
"received illegal salaries
and kickbacks.

263
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,252
"Last year alone,
I earned $5,000.

264
00:10:30,286 --> 00:10:32,504
Number two..."
I can read them myself

265
00:10:32,555 --> 00:10:34,006
without you reading them to me
like I'm some idiot.

266
00:10:34,057 --> 00:10:35,724
"Number three."

267
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:38,394
Last year Sue Sylvester locked
seven Cheerios! In a...

268
00:10:38,428 --> 00:10:39,812
"dog crate in order
to potty-train them."

269
00:10:39,846 --> 00:10:41,563
What are you doing?

270
00:10:41,598 --> 00:10:43,732
I soaked my uniform
in lighter fluid overnight,

271
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:46,485
and will now solemnize
my departure from the Cheerios!

272
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:49,772
By lighting it on fire.

273
00:10:49,806 --> 00:10:51,240
(screams) Lord Jesus!

274
00:10:51,274 --> 00:10:53,692
This fool done tried
to set my hair on fire!

275
00:10:54,527 --> 00:10:56,912
Okay, guys, listen up.

276
00:10:56,946 --> 00:10:59,114
Uh, first up, we're gonna tackle Icona Pop.
(phone buzzes)

277
00:10:59,148 --> 00:11:01,667
It's got a unique beat,
but not entire different from...

278
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:03,168
All right, look.
I'm-I'm sorry.

279
00:11:03,203 --> 00:11:04,753
Excuse me, Mr. Shue,
but I've got to say something.

280
00:11:04,788 --> 00:11:05,587
Okay.

281
00:11:05,622 --> 00:11:08,674
(sighs)

282
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,843
Look, so I hate
to pull a Brittany here,

283
00:11:10,877 --> 00:11:13,095
but the bottom line is,
I'm not performing in regionals

284
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:15,097
until Catfish reveals
themselves.

285
00:11:15,131 --> 00:11:17,800
This whole situation is out
of hand and needs to end.

286
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:20,519
Hey, look, I'm serious, okay?

287
00:11:20,553 --> 00:11:23,439
I can't take it anymore,
it-it's tearing me apart.

288
00:11:23,473 --> 00:11:26,025
And someone in this room
is playing games with me,

289
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:28,027
and I want to know who!

290
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:29,895
Somebody, just say who it is.
I don't think it's any of us.

291
00:11:29,946 --> 00:11:32,481
Pull out your phones! Everybody
pull out your phones right now!

292
00:11:32,515 --> 00:11:33,732
Ryder, relax, man.
Dude.

293
00:11:33,783 --> 00:11:35,234
I know this is upsetting, but...

294
00:11:35,285 --> 00:11:36,535
Well, now nobody
is going to admit it

295
00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:38,570
for fear of being murdered.

296
00:11:38,621 --> 00:11:40,072
I've told this person
everything,

297
00:11:40,123 --> 00:11:42,291
and I want to know who it is.

298
00:11:42,325 --> 00:11:44,460
I know you're upset... I want to know...
No, you don't know.

299
00:11:44,494 --> 00:11:46,245
You don't know, okay? Who is it?

300
00:11:46,296 --> 00:11:47,329
It's not me.

301
00:11:47,363 --> 00:11:49,298
All right, fine.
If nobody's gonna say anything,

302
00:11:49,332 --> 00:11:51,500
pull out your phones. And I want
to see all of your phones.

303
00:11:51,534 --> 00:11:53,469
Are you serious?
All of your phones.

304
00:11:53,503 --> 00:11:56,221
Pull out your texts. I'm serious!
Texts! (All shouting)

305
00:11:56,256 --> 00:11:57,923
Whoever it is, just say it.

306
00:11:57,974 --> 00:12:00,041
Who is it?
It's me.

307
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,311
I'm Catfish.

308
00:12:09,936 --> 00:12:11,987
What? What do you...?

309
00:12:12,021 --> 00:12:14,773
No, I-I-I asked you.
You swore to me.

310
00:12:14,808 --> 00:12:16,241
I'm sorry.

311
00:12:16,276 --> 00:12:19,194
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

312
00:12:19,228 --> 00:12:21,363
Look, just take it easy,
Ryder, okay?

313
00:12:21,397 --> 00:12:22,998
This was just a little joke.

314
00:12:23,032 --> 00:12:24,500
Things got out of hand.

315
00:12:24,534 --> 00:12:26,368
(scoffs)

316
00:12:26,402 --> 00:12:29,588
What, you're-you're
defending her?

317
00:12:29,622 --> 00:12:31,340
Huh? Are you kidding me?

318
00:12:34,076 --> 00:12:36,578
What's wrong with you people?

319
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,681
WILL:
Ryder...

320
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,222
BOY:
Marley, that's messed up.

321
00:12:47,256 --> 00:12:49,691
Well, if you were asking me
to marry you,

322
00:12:49,726 --> 00:12:51,393
I'd want that big one.

323
00:12:51,427 --> 00:12:53,112
My fingers are on
the larger side,

324
00:12:53,146 --> 00:12:55,063
and you have to figure,
with my build,

325
00:12:55,097 --> 00:12:56,732
after we have a few babies,

326
00:12:56,766 --> 00:12:59,451
I may put on
a couple of pounds.

327
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:01,153
Tina, I'm looking
for a ring for Kurt.

328
00:13:01,204 --> 00:13:03,822
He is so lucky.

329
00:13:03,873 --> 00:13:06,291
Those are engagement rings.

330
00:13:06,326 --> 00:13:08,994
That's good because I'm looking
to get engaged.

331
00:13:09,045 --> 00:13:10,245
I am constantly

332
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:12,998
telling my nieces
and nephews to wear condoms.

333
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:14,917
It's for my boyfriend.
I'm not pregnant.

334
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:16,001
He used to be

335
00:13:16,052 --> 00:13:17,503
my boyfriend. It was...
the whole thing,

336
00:13:17,554 --> 00:13:19,304
it's very complicated.
I won't get into it.

337
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:20,639
But basically,
I love him very much,

338
00:13:20,673 --> 00:13:23,142
and I want to spend
the rest of my life with him,

339
00:13:23,176 --> 00:13:25,177
so I'm going to ask
him to marry me.

340
00:13:25,228 --> 00:13:26,929
Tell me about your man.

341
00:13:26,963 --> 00:13:30,015
Really?

342
00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:32,684
Is he your soul mate?

343
00:13:32,735 --> 00:13:34,937
Yes, he is.

344
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,111
I met Liz when we were 18.

345
00:13:43,145 --> 00:13:45,280
It was at a Styx concert

346
00:13:45,314 --> 00:13:47,366
back when they were doing
hard rock,

347
00:13:47,417 --> 00:13:50,252
not this weird robot stuff.

348
00:13:50,286 --> 00:13:53,088
We've been together ever since.

349
00:13:53,122 --> 00:13:56,341
Doesn't matter
how young or old you are.

350
00:13:56,376 --> 00:13:58,293
True love is true love.

351
00:13:58,327 --> 00:14:01,630
My friends have been
giving me so much flak.

352
00:14:01,664 --> 00:14:04,766
If we all had listened,
we wouldn't be moments away

353
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:07,886
from the Supreme Court
finally telling us

354
00:14:07,937 --> 00:14:11,390
that we are just as crazy
and awesome as everybody else.

355
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:12,941
Hey, dude.

356
00:14:12,976 --> 00:14:14,776
Don't try to stop me.
I'm doing this, okay?

357
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:16,862
I love you and I want to support
you, so if you're really

358
00:14:16,896 --> 00:14:18,647
gonna do this, I'm helping
you pick out the ring.

359
00:14:18,681 --> 00:14:20,649
I have, like, the best taste.
Is this him?

360
00:14:20,683 --> 00:14:21,950
No. Oh, no.
No.

361
00:14:21,985 --> 00:14:24,052
I mean, he wants to do me,
but we're just friends.

362
00:14:24,086 --> 00:14:26,054
Sam.
Jan.

363
00:14:26,088 --> 00:14:28,557
Would you excuse us
for just a moment?

364
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:29,558
Yeah, sure.

365
00:14:29,592 --> 00:14:31,092
(hushed):
I don't.

366
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,094
(hushed): You <i>do</i> want to do me.

367
00:14:34,948 --> 00:14:36,398
Forgive me for being pushy,

368
00:14:36,432 --> 00:14:39,735
but do you have anyone
to advise you on this?

369
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:41,954
Someone who would
really understand?

370
00:14:41,988 --> 00:14:44,573
Someone... gay?

371
00:14:44,607 --> 00:14:46,241
Yeah.
Not really.

372
00:14:46,275 --> 00:14:49,244
I just want you guys
to see what's possible

373
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:51,179
when two people
really love each other.

374
00:14:51,214 --> 00:14:53,916
Sound good?

375
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,784
(school bell ringing)

376
00:15:01,674 --> 00:15:03,124
Brittany, have a seat.

377
00:15:03,142 --> 00:15:04,509
We need to chat.

378
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,795
I thought you were teaching
aerobics to fat soccer moms.

379
00:15:06,813 --> 00:15:08,764
Oh, I just stopped
by the teachers' lounge

380
00:15:08,798 --> 00:15:11,033
to retrieve my baby's
placenta in the fridge.

381
00:15:11,801 --> 00:15:13,485
Brittany, Sue and I are

382
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,937
very worried about you.

383
00:15:14,971 --> 00:15:16,939
And we need to know
what's going on.

384
00:15:16,973 --> 00:15:20,025
I refuse to speak to either of
you in this office. It's dusty

385
00:15:20,076 --> 00:15:21,977
and drab and Mr. Shue's
"Teacher of The Year"

386
00:15:21,995 --> 00:15:23,862
picture really creeps me out.
So there's

387
00:15:23,913 --> 00:15:25,313
only one place that I'll talk:

388
00:15:25,331 --> 00:15:29,150
My turf, my rules, my <i>Fondue.</i>

389
00:15:29,168 --> 00:15:31,119
♪ Fondue for two! ♪
♪ Hey!

390
00:15:31,154 --> 00:15:33,538
♪ Fondue for two!
♪ That's some hot dish!

391
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:35,540
♪ Fondue for two!

392
00:15:35,591 --> 00:15:37,659
Welcome back to <i>Fondue for Two.</i>

393
00:15:37,677 --> 00:15:40,345
Tonight's guests are two sworn
enemies who became friends,

394
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,215
then became enemies again,
then became friends again,

395
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:46,001
then enemies, and then
everybody stopped caring.

396
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:48,003
Sue Sylvester
and Will Schuester.

397
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:49,671
It's great to be here.
Yeah.

398
00:15:49,689 --> 00:15:50,856
Oh, my goodness,

399
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,841
this fondue smells disgusting.

400
00:15:52,859 --> 00:15:54,860
It's like somebody poured
chardonnay on a homeless woman

401
00:15:54,894 --> 00:15:56,028
who'd been dead several days.

402
00:15:56,062 --> 00:15:57,145
Yeah, fantastic.

403
00:15:57,179 --> 00:15:59,815
So, Mr. Shue, is it true
that you and Emma

404
00:15:59,849 --> 00:16:00,983
are finally getting married?

405
00:16:01,017 --> 00:16:02,200
Yeah, it looks like it.

406
00:16:02,235 --> 00:16:04,185
Awesome. Do you plan
on having children,

407
00:16:04,203 --> 00:16:06,321
or just continue to have
weirdly intimate relationships

408
00:16:06,355 --> 00:16:07,990
with high school students
instead of children?

409
00:16:08,024 --> 00:16:09,408
No, we'd like to have kids.

410
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:11,376
Speaking of kids,
Sue Sylvester,

411
00:16:11,411 --> 00:16:14,913
what if I were to tell you
that I know the true identity

412
00:16:14,964 --> 00:16:16,081
of your baby's
celebrity father?

413
00:16:16,132 --> 00:16:18,083
I would say that's highly unlikely.
What if I were

414
00:16:18,134 --> 00:16:20,736
to tell you that I know for a
fact that it's Michael Bolton?

415
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:23,655
I would say that you have
no proof.

416
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:27,943
Well, Michael Bolton played in
a concert in Columbus, Ohio

417
00:16:27,977 --> 00:16:30,445
nine months to the day before
your daughter was born.

418
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:33,165
Also, Robin's birth certificate
says she was born in.

419
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,118
"Ol' Milton Beach," which is
an anagram for "Michael Bolton."

420
00:16:36,152 --> 00:16:39,621
Also, Michael Bolton has a new
album out, and track number one

421
00:16:39,655 --> 00:16:43,675
is called "So Proud to Be
Your Father, Robin Sylvester."

422
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,011
Michael Bolton and I met in 1994
in Los Angeles

423
00:16:46,045 --> 00:16:48,130
when I punctured his windpipe
with a letter opener

424
00:16:48,164 --> 00:16:51,350
at Kate Mantilini's where
he was having lunch and

425
00:16:51,384 --> 00:16:53,435
I just happened
to be doing my taxes.

426
00:16:53,469 --> 00:16:56,271
He choked after inhaling in
a chunk of his own hair,

427
00:16:56,305 --> 00:16:59,057
and I saved his life.
He's owed me a favor ever since.

428
00:16:59,108 --> 00:17:01,610
And just in case
you're wondering,

429
00:17:01,644 --> 00:17:04,062
Michael Bolton
is a fantastic lover.

430
00:17:04,113 --> 00:17:06,114
Wow. We did it all night, Will.

431
00:17:06,149 --> 00:17:07,866
We did it every which way.

432
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,401
Cool.

433
00:17:09,452 --> 00:17:11,536
(ringing)

434
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:13,121
Pick up.

435
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,291
I'm sorry, did,
uh, hell just freeze over

436
00:17:16,325 --> 00:17:18,877
or did you just White Chocolate
butt-dial me?

437
00:17:18,911 --> 00:17:20,212
Hey, look,
I need to talk to you.

438
00:17:20,246 --> 00:17:22,748
Sorry, no can do, Trouts,
I just got back

439
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,550
from a dance class and
I'm already five minutes late

440
00:17:25,585 --> 00:17:28,420
for drinks with this insanely
hot off-Broadway <i>choreographer.</i>

441
00:17:28,471 --> 00:17:30,055
It's about Brittany.
Obviously.

442
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:31,807
Okay, she broke up with me.
Inevitably.

443
00:17:31,841 --> 00:17:33,675
Okay, look, she's been acting
really weird since she met with

444
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:35,594
those people at MIT, okay? She
even dropped out of regionals.

445
00:17:35,645 --> 00:17:37,229
Okay, and are we sure

446
00:17:37,263 --> 00:17:39,815
it's not just Britney 3.0 Week
in Glee Club?

447
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:41,566
Look, okay, I know I'm not
your favorite person,

448
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:43,151
but you also know
that I'd help you

449
00:17:43,186 --> 00:17:46,488
if you ever asked me to.

450
00:17:46,522 --> 00:17:51,109
Something, something's wrong.
I'm asking you for help.

451
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,279
It was love at first sticks,

452
00:17:55,306 --> 00:17:57,808
that's what we always say.

453
00:17:57,842 --> 00:18:00,427
Well, the irony was that we met
at the concert, you know.

454
00:18:00,478 --> 00:18:03,597
We grew up in the same town just a
few blocks from each other. Wow.

455
00:18:03,648 --> 00:18:05,816
We went to the same high school.
You guys are

456
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,184
like a Nora Ephron movie.
Exactly.

457
00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:08,685
Did you go to prom together?

458
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:09,987
No.
Yeah, well...

459
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:11,888
Well, we went together
as a group.

460
00:18:11,906 --> 00:18:13,440
We took boys, of course.

461
00:18:13,491 --> 00:18:15,058
Merle and Tommy,
those poor fools.

462
00:18:15,076 --> 00:18:17,494
Merle and Tom. They had no
idea what was going on.

463
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:21,231
It was different times then,
you know.

464
00:18:21,249 --> 00:18:23,733
There were, there were
no gay clubs at school.

465
00:18:23,752 --> 00:18:27,538
You know, nobody talked about
it. We had no representation.

466
00:18:27,572 --> 00:18:30,073
But somehow
we always found a way.

467
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:32,960
That summer we went on a bus
tour of the United States.

468
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,212
We saw all the sights.

469
00:18:35,246 --> 00:18:38,348
And in the end we decided
we liked Ohio the best.

470
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:42,970
Yeah, yeah, came back,
moved in together,

471
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:46,390
got each other through college,
and we broke up twice,

472
00:18:46,424 --> 00:18:48,475
and got back
together again twice.

473
00:18:48,526 --> 00:18:50,227
And then we bought
the house in Lima.

474
00:18:50,261 --> 00:18:52,362
What haven't
we seen from our porch?

475
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:53,864
Nothing.
Hmm.

476
00:18:53,898 --> 00:18:55,265
AIDS.
Yeah.

477
00:18:55,283 --> 00:18:57,067
Don't Ask, Don't Tell.

478
00:18:57,101 --> 00:18:59,036
<i>Ellen.</i>

479
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:02,156
We've seen it all
side-by-side.

480
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:05,659
Remember when we couldn't even
do this in public, hold hands?

481
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,161
Oh, yeah.

482
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:08,445
You guys are so sweet.

483
00:19:08,463 --> 00:19:11,165
But you know, when I asked you
"How did you guys meet?"

484
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,250
I actually meant,
"How did you meet Blaine?"

485
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:14,751
Oh! At the mall.

486
00:19:14,785 --> 00:19:16,620
I was clothes shopping with Tina

487
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:19,756
and we were at the food court
at Sbarro,

488
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,009
and Jan and I just got
to talking.

489
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,927
And I said,
"Why don't we continue this

490
00:19:23,961 --> 00:19:26,296
over dinner at Breadstix?"
We've been coming here 20 years.

491
00:19:26,314 --> 00:19:27,397
Thirty.

492
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:28,599
30 years? 30. Wow.

493
00:19:28,633 --> 00:19:31,018
We camped out
for the grand opening.

494
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,569
Yes, we did.

495
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,188
Well, I'm glad
you recommended it, Jan.

496
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,440
I mean, it's great and really
inspiring to hear your story.

497
00:19:36,474 --> 00:19:39,142
You know, I know I don't, and we
don't really have too many

498
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,311
gay and lesbian role models
to look up to, so...

499
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:43,447
You guys are a sweet couple.

500
00:19:43,481 --> 00:19:45,866
Thank you.
Oh, we're not a couple.

501
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:49,036
Would you have married me
if I had asked you?

502
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,787
I mean, if we were allowed to?

503
00:19:50,821 --> 00:19:51,821
I always said yeah,

504
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,757
as soon as it's legal in Ohio.

505
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:54,824
It will be.
Yeah.

506
00:19:54,843 --> 00:19:56,543
Eventually.

507
00:19:56,594 --> 00:20:00,664
But in the meantime, there are still
plenty of places where it's legal.

508
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:05,636
And so, Elizabeth
Margaret Stevens...

509
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:09,389
...will you legally marry me?

510
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,275
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, oh!

511
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:13,610
Oh, honey, yes.

512
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,445
(patrons exclaim, cheer)

513
00:20:17,615 --> 00:20:19,449
(whooping)

514
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:23,620
(school bell ringing)

515
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,188
Hey, can we talk?

516
00:20:25,206 --> 00:20:27,023
Why don't you just text me?

517
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:30,994
I know it was wrong
and I know you're hurt,

518
00:20:31,028 --> 00:20:33,413
but you're taking it
out on everyone,

519
00:20:33,464 --> 00:20:36,083
and that's not fair.
We need you for regionals!

520
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:37,751
You don't need me, all right?

521
00:20:37,802 --> 00:20:39,703
Jake's a better dancer,
Artie's a better singer,

522
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:40,870
and Sam's better looking.

523
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:42,372
Now you're just feeling
sorry for yourself.

524
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,541
We're not competing with
each other, we're a team and...

525
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,976
Why?

526
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:49,146
Why what? I need to know why.
Okay, you say we're

527
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,048
a team, but you've been lying
to me and messing with my head,

528
00:20:52,066 --> 00:20:54,884
and I need some kind of explanation
if I'm gonna go to regionals.

529
00:20:54,903 --> 00:20:56,320
Because....

530
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:01,241
because I know
I'm not your vision of beauty.

531
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:05,562
Wait. It-It was...?

532
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,949
Yes, I'm Unique aka Wade,

aka Katie, aka Catfish.

534
00:21:10,752 --> 00:21:13,537
Marley, I love you,
but you don't have to cover

535
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:14,671
for me anymore.

536
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,974
(voice breaking): It started
off innocent at first,

537
00:21:17,008 --> 00:21:20,127
and then he started
telling me things,

538
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:22,346
and it got way
too deep to stop.

539
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,847
And you don't know how long

540
00:21:23,881 --> 00:21:26,216
it's been since I felt this
close to someone

541
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,751

gonna punch me in the face,

00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:38,478
but the truth is, I reached out
to you because I liked you.

545
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:40,647
So I got a picture
of a cute blonde

546
00:21:40,698 --> 00:21:42,099

You're acting like a
completely different person,

580
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:10,237

I have to jump on this offer
before it gets taken away.

702
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:22,886
They want me
to leave immediately.

703
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,689
That's why I had that meltdown.

00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:27,391

705
00:29:27,425 --> 00:29:30,894
Um... my entire life,

706
00:29:30,928 --> 00:29:34,731
people have always told me
that I was stupid.

707
00:29:34,765 --> 00:29:39,769
And... after a while
I started to believe them.

708
00:29:40,771 --> 00:29:43,740
And it wasn't until...

709
00:29:43,774 --> 00:29:46,743
I walked in this room...
(sniffles, sighs)

710
00:29:46,777 --> 00:29:48,612
...and I joined this club

711
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:51,114
that I really started
believing in myself.

712
00:29:51,132 --> 00:29:54,668
And as soon as I did that,
as soon as...

713
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:58,672
I started believing that maybe
I was smart after all,

714
00:29:58,723 --> 00:30:01,341

the whole world did, too.

and who I take his virginity,

731

732
00:30:43,685 --> 00:30:47,387

all like the foster kids

733
00:30:47,438 --> 00:30:49,940
who come to live with us
when the orphanage closes

734
00:30:49,974 --> 00:30:53,276
(laughter) and that we don't trust

735
00:30:53,311 --> 00:30:54,811

in the 2013 Greater Midwest.

880
00:37:36,481 --> 00:37:39,699
Show Choir Regionals goes to...

881
00:37:39,734 --> 00:37:43,203
the Waffle-Toots!
(cheering and applause)

882
00:37:50,995 --> 00:37:54,297
Now the moment
we've all been waiting for.

883
00:37:54,332 --> 00:37:57,334
In second place...

884
00:38:01,172 --> 00:38:03,807
...from Indianapolis, Indiana,
the Hoosierdaddies,

885
00:38:03,841 --> 00:38:07,644
and first place goes
to McKinley High New Directions!

886
00:38:07,678 --> 00:38:09,679
(cheering and applause)

887
00:38:37,792 --> 00:38:40,427
(cheering and applause
continues)

888
00:38:51,939 --> 00:38:53,940
(footfalls approaching)

889
00:39:15,296 --> 00:39:16,913
McKinley High is officially
on its way to becoming

890
00:39:16,964 --> 00:39:19,082
a regionals dynasty!
(cheering and applause)

891
00:39:19,133 --> 00:39:21,585
Only 24 more of these babies
before we catch up

892
00:39:21,636 --> 00:39:23,169
to Vocal Adrenaline.
Oh, please.

893
00:39:23,203 --> 00:39:24,838
Vocal Adrenaline's time
has passed.

894
00:39:24,872 --> 00:39:27,841
The present and the future is
all about the New Directions!

895
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:31,011
And we are going to prove it
when we go to sunny Los Angeles

896
00:39:31,045 --> 00:39:33,847
for nationals and take home
our second national championship

897
00:39:33,881 --> 00:39:36,433
in a row! That's right.
That's right.

898
00:39:36,484 --> 00:39:39,436
Miss Pillsbury,
who's your friend?

899
00:39:40,821 --> 00:39:42,939
Um, Miss Pillsbury, you're
supposed to bring someone in

900
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,941
to bless the team
<i>before</i> the big game.

901
00:39:44,992 --> 00:39:47,360
Okay. Thank you.

902
00:39:47,394 --> 00:39:50,530
Um, I figured out
that I can't handle the pressure

903
00:39:50,564 --> 00:39:53,667
of a big wedding,
so I told Will,

904
00:39:53,701 --> 00:39:57,671
if we're gonna get married, that
I wanted an intimate ceremony

905
00:39:57,705 --> 00:40:02,175
in a special place surrounded
by the people that we love.

906
00:40:02,209 --> 00:40:04,177
Are you guys seriously
throwing a surprise wedding?

907
00:40:04,211 --> 00:40:06,296
Just like Brooke Burke
and David Charvet?

908
00:40:06,347 --> 00:40:10,100
Yes. (Chuckles) No music,
no reception, no planning.

909
00:40:10,134 --> 00:40:13,270
Just me, the one true love
of my life,

910
00:40:13,304 --> 00:40:15,805
and then we'll have
a little dinner at Breadstix.

911
00:40:27,034 --> 00:40:30,036
(New Directions!
Humming "Bridal Chorus")

912
00:40:50,675 --> 00:40:52,642
(sighs)

913
00:40:52,677 --> 00:40:54,978
WILL: You're still here.
(chuckling): I'm here.

914
00:40:55,012 --> 00:40:56,680
MINISTER:
Do you guys have

915
00:40:56,731 --> 00:40:59,149
vows prepared?
I knew I forgot something

916
00:40:59,183 --> 00:41:00,817
and... no. (Laughing): No.

917
00:41:00,851 --> 00:41:03,937
Um... Well, hold on. You always get
to make the romantic speeches,

918
00:41:03,971 --> 00:41:07,190
so, um, why don't you
let me do it this time?

919
00:41:07,241 --> 00:41:10,910
I'd love that.
Yeah? Okay.

920
00:41:10,945 --> 00:41:12,912
There was this one day, um,

921
00:41:12,947 --> 00:41:15,115
right around the time
that we first met.

922
00:41:15,149 --> 00:41:16,533
Um, out in the courtyard.

923
00:41:16,584 --> 00:41:18,835
And I had gum stuck

924
00:41:18,869 --> 00:41:20,003
to the bottom of my shoe,

925
00:41:20,037 --> 00:41:22,839
and you scraped it off
with a credit card.

926
00:41:22,873 --> 00:41:24,541
And whenever things in my head

927
00:41:24,592 --> 00:41:27,844
get all gooey and sticky and
messy and I can't get 'em out,

928
00:41:27,878 --> 00:41:30,380
you always come along
and you make me feel clean

929
00:41:30,431 --> 00:41:33,183
and you make me feel
whole again.

930
00:41:33,217 --> 00:41:37,103
Will, just as I know
that the sky is blue,

931
00:41:37,138 --> 00:41:41,524
I know that you and I
are meant to be together.

932
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:44,227
You are my hero, you are...

933
00:41:44,278 --> 00:41:47,364
my one true love,
you are my inspiration.

934
00:41:47,398 --> 00:41:49,733
I love you, Will Schuester.

935
00:41:49,784 --> 00:41:52,619
(shuddering breath) I can't
believe this is happening.

936
00:41:52,653 --> 00:41:54,654
(laughs)

937
00:41:57,291 --> 00:42:00,577
(sighs) I-I remember
that day with the gum.

938
00:42:00,628 --> 00:42:03,380
And the day you chaperoned
the field trip to Carmel High.

939
00:42:03,414 --> 00:42:05,715
And the red coat you wore

940
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:08,051
when you took the team
to their first sectionals.

941
00:42:08,085 --> 00:42:09,753
I love that coat. I got it on sale.
(chuckles)

942
00:42:12,256 --> 00:42:15,392
I remember and notice
everything about you.

943
00:42:15,426 --> 00:42:17,394
(exhales)

944
00:42:17,428 --> 00:42:20,063
You only get one
true love of your life.

945
00:42:20,097 --> 00:42:22,098
And you are mine, Emma.

946
00:42:22,149 --> 00:42:24,484
And I promise you
that as long as you

947
00:42:24,518 --> 00:42:26,736
just keep being you
and-and let me love you,

948
00:42:26,771 --> 00:42:28,405
I will be
the happiest man alive.

949
00:42:28,439 --> 00:42:31,074
And can we just skip to the
"I do" part because I can't...

950
00:42:31,108 --> 00:42:32,075
(chuckles) I can't

951
00:42:32,109 --> 00:42:33,443
spend one more minute

952
00:42:33,494 --> 00:42:35,111
without being
this woman's husband.

953
00:42:35,162 --> 00:42:37,747
Works for me. I have
a reservation at Breadstix, too.

954
00:42:37,782 --> 00:42:39,666
(laughter) We'll see you there.

955
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,667
Emma,

956
00:42:40,701 --> 00:42:43,203
do you take Will
to be your husband,

957
00:42:43,237 --> 00:42:46,756
to love and honor, forsaking all
others from this day forward?

958
00:42:46,791 --> 00:42:49,759
I do. I do. I do. I do.
(chuckles)

959
00:42:49,794 --> 00:42:50,760
Will?

960
00:42:50,795 --> 00:42:52,178
Oh, I definitely do.

961
00:42:52,213 --> 00:42:53,596
(laughter)

962
00:42:53,631 --> 00:42:55,598
By the power vested in me

963
00:42:55,633 --> 00:42:58,435
and all the rest, Will, Emma...

964
00:42:58,469 --> 00:43:02,605
Wemma... I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

965
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,691
Oh!
(cheering and applause)
