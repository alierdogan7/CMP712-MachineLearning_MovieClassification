00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,914
(Whistling)

2
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:21,350
Hey! You have any change?

3
00:00:21,352 --> 00:00:23,018
Oh, sorry. I only have 20s.

4
00:00:23,531 --> 00:00:25,078
I got them from working.

5
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,556
(Whistling)

6
00:00:27,558 --> 00:00:29,758
Rebecca: How cute were we at summer camp?

7
00:00:29,783 --> 00:00:32,960
Look, oh, there's us in the
Camp Canyon Grove lunch line.

8
00:00:33,148 --> 00:00:34,163
Oh. So cute!

9
00:00:35,227 --> 00:00:36,734
There's you lifting weights.

10
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:37,757
Supes cute.

11
00:00:37,782 --> 00:00:40,082
There's you flexing. Cute, cute, cute.

12
00:00:41,031 --> 00:00:44,100
Oh, this is you in the camp chapel.

13
00:00:44,437 --> 00:00:46,749
Remember? You were the
only one who went in there.

14
00:00:46,835 --> 00:00:48,281
Yeah, I know it's not cool

15
00:00:48,306 --> 00:00:49,976
to believe in God and stuff, but I do.

16
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:52,453
Oh, my God. That's, like... that's insane.

17
00:00:52,478 --> 00:00:53,765
I believe in God, too.

18
00:00:54,351 --> 00:00:55,551
What are the odds?

19
00:00:56,148 --> 00:00:57,710
<i>I think a lot of people believe in...</i>

20
00:00:57,735 --> 00:00:58,820
Man: Hey, man.

21
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,539
Josh: What's wrong?

22
00:01:01,288 --> 00:01:03,375
Sorry, it's... Greg's over there,

23
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,085
and I haven't really seen
him since our... our date.

24
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:08,661
You took some guy home

25
00:01:08,686 --> 00:01:10,052
from our date

26
00:01:10,077 --> 00:01:12,610
and slept with him?
What is wrong with you?!

27
00:01:12,635 --> 00:01:14,168
(Sighs)

28
00:01:14,193 --> 00:01:15,392
Hi!

29
00:01:15,417 --> 00:01:16,717
(Laughing)

30
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:19,015
- How are you? 
- I'm good.

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,074
I'd ask how you are, but I already know.

32
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:22,198
You're terrible.

33
00:01:22,578 --> 00:01:24,181
W-what?

34
00:01:24,183 --> 00:01:25,583
She's horrible.

35
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,751
What are you talking
about? What did she do?

36
00:01:27,753 --> 00:01:30,221
<i>(Laughing) What didn't she do?</i>

37
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:31,755
Um, Greg, what are you doing?

38
00:01:31,757 --> 00:01:34,024
Don't say anything. What are...? What?

39
00:01:34,026 --> 00:01:36,160
It's nothing. Uh, uh,
oh, oh, no, don't worry.

40
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:39,230
I won't tell him anything.
Why? Because I'm not terrible.

41
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:43,567
O-okay, maybe you had a bad
date, but Rebecca is awesome.

42
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:44,635
She just moved here

43
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:45,936
and already she's done

44
00:01:45,938 --> 00:01:47,204
so much for everybody.

45
00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:48,339
No, I can't argue with that.

46
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:51,000
<i>She has done so, so much.</i>

47
00:01:51,452 --> 00:01:54,353
What's this? Oh, no, no, no,
no. It's nothing! It's nothing!

48
00:01:54,378 --> 00:01:57,112
Pictures from your little summer
camp fling, which you lied to me

49
00:01:57,137 --> 00:01:58,336
and everyone else about.

50
00:01:58,361 --> 00:02:00,395
Dude, you're being a
little harsh to Rebecca.

51
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,752
Okay? Are you gonna defend her?

52
00:02:01,787 --> 00:02:03,287
You're just as bad, Chan.

53
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,655
Look at you.

54
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:06,123
Cuddling up over Boba when you know

55
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,825
your girlfriend would
not be cool with that.

56
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:09,193
There's a word for that. What is it?

57
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:10,594
Oh, yeah. Terrible.

58
00:02:10,968 --> 00:02:12,263
Man: Number 31!

59
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,430
That's me.

60
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:15,947
Bye, liars and terrible people.

61
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,403
That was ridiculous.

62
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,005
<i>He is ridiculous.</i>

63
00:02:21,664 --> 00:02:23,908
Who just marches up to people
and tells them they're terrible?

64
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,542
- I know, right? 
- That's insane!

65
00:02:25,544 --> 00:02:26,911
No one has ever said anything

66
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:28,648
like that to me before in my life!

67
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,614
Yeah, me neither.

68
00:02:31,179 --> 00:02:33,951
Naomi: You're selfish
and dramatic and weird.

69
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:35,920
You drove your father out of this house.

70
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,288
You're terrible!

71
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,723
Yeah. I mean, yeah, that's a...

72
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:41,592
That's a bad thing to say to somebody.

73
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:42,914
That would scar you.

74
00:02:42,971 --> 00:02:45,938
There is nothing wrong
with us. Especially not you.

75
00:02:45,963 --> 00:02:48,773
You're great! You're awesome.

76
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:03,080
- I should go. 
- Well, I should probably go.

77
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:05,582
- Oh, yeah, let's go.
- Yeah, here you go. Yeah.

78
00:03:05,584 --> 00:03:07,468
Okay. Okay, yup.

79
00:03:07,493 --> 00:03:08,726
I don't care what he says.

80
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,655
<i>I am a good person. I'm a great person.</i>

81
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:13,424
I do good things all the time, like...

82
00:03:14,203 --> 00:03:15,828
Hi. Here.

83
00:03:16,775 --> 00:03:18,241
Yes. (Inhale deeply through her nose)

84
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:21,117
And is there anything else
that I can do for you today?

85
00:03:23,195 --> 00:03:24,768
<i>Rebecca: So I did something</i>

86
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,303
that wasn't great.

87
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:28,205
I mean, yeah, I'm not proud of it,

88
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:30,908
especially since I came to
this city for a new start.

89
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,643
I guess I messed that up.

90
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:35,779
But what I did wasn't, like,
Hitler level or anything.

91
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,648
This is a really nice car.

92
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,017
Oh, thanks! It's a 2015 Hyundai Sonata.

93
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,386
It has 185 horsepower,
17-inch alloy wheels,

94
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,854
a four-cylinder engine, heated seats,

95
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,648
and a hands-free smart trunk.

96
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:51,695
Greg is so wrong about me.

97
00:03:51,992 --> 00:03:54,698
I'll show him. You just watch.

98
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,234
Yeah, you can let me out here.

99
00:03:56,602 --> 00:03:58,068

Hey, Pam-spray,

136
00:05:07,606 --> 00:05:10,507
did you rewrite my brief
for the Caswick case?

137
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:12,543
Yeah, three days ago.

138
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,044
It's on your desk.

139
00:05:14,046 --> 00:05:17,448
Oh, then I spilled some
coffee on that bad boy.

140
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,683
Can you hop on your Pamster
wheel and print me up

141
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:20,918
another one?

142
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,387
Nope. You're rude.

143
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,988
And you're Pam.

144
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,657
(Laughing)

145
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,093
Ooh! (Laughter)

146
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,894
Oh, Karen, did you file those briefs?

147
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:33,797
No, I'm sorry, my snake is
sick, and I just can't focus

148
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:34,998
whenever my snake is sick.

149
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,366
Also, my internet is down,

150
00:05:36,368 --> 00:05:38,502
so I can't post about
it on my YouTube channel.

151
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,370
So I was gonna tweet about it instead,

152
00:05:40,372 --> 00:05:42,473
<i>but then my account got hacked again, so...</i>

153
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,843
Okay, Karen, Karen, you told
me all of this this morning,

154
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,978
and you're my case assistant, and I just...

155
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,947
I really need you to focus.

156
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:53,016
I need to go. My electrolytes are low.

157
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:57,685

159
00:05:59,164 --> 00:06:00,757
Okay, no big deal,

160
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,494
but I got lattes for the entire office.

161
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,896
That's right, more than three bucks!

162
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:08,198
And everyone's name is
written correctly on the cup.

163
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,968
Also, I brought donuts for everybody.

164
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,903
And I'm not talking
about the plain ones, no,

165
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:14,605
they got all the goop on them.

166
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,507
So come get it.

167
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,742
Oh, Karen. I saw that flyer last week.

168
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:21,178
Are you still crowdfunding for
Long John Slither's fang cancer?

169
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,880
Yeah, I just found out

170
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,214
- it's terminal. 
- Oh, my God.

171
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:25,916
We're gonna fight this, okay?

172
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,384
I pledge $1,000

173
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:29,119
to help your sick snake.

174
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:30,621
- Oh, thank... thank you. 
- Yes.

175
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,156
He's in so much pain.

176
00:06:33,031 --> 00:06:34,158
Paula: So...

177
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,193
Clearly, you're still on this

178
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:37,261
"I'm a good person" thing.

179
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,663
I mean, Greg really got to me this morning.

180
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,198
Oh, come on!

181
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,667
You are not a terrible person.

182
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:46,403
Greg is just a whiny little bitch.

183
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:47,037
Yeah.

184
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,071
And sexy.

185
00:06:48,073 --> 00:06:48,939
He should be

186
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:50,541
a-a search term on porn sites.

187
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:51,441
Okay.

188
00:06:51,443 --> 00:06:52,576
But who cares what he thinks?

189
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,977
Well, I care what he thinks,

190
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:55,982
because I care what me thinks

191
00:06:55,984 --> 00:06:58,392
and me wants me to be a good person.

192
00:06:58,417 --> 00:06:59,883
Am I a good person?

193
00:06:59,885 --> 00:07:01,952
Being a good person is overrated.

194
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:03,887
I mean, who cares about that?

195
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:04,865
Darryl!

196
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:05,773
Darryl, Darryl, Darryl.

197
00:07:05,798 --> 00:07:06,797
Just the man I wanted to see.

198
00:07:06,822 --> 00:07:08,188
Are you still selling chocolate bars

199
00:07:08,213 --> 00:07:09,737
for your daughter's baseball team?

200
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,228
- Mm-hmm. 
- Okay, great.

201
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,530
I'm gonna buy all of the chocolate bars.

202
00:07:13,532 --> 00:07:14,218
All.

203
00:07:14,243 --> 00:07:15,275
All!

204
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,445
Yeah.

205
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,270
Now, you might be thinking, "what?

206
00:07:18,295 --> 00:07:19,594
"Rebecca, that's too nice.

207
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:20,785
It's too good."

208
00:07:20,914 --> 00:07:22,998
Well, that's who I am, people.

209
00:07:23,023 --> 00:07:23,967
My goodness

210
00:07:23,992 --> 00:07:26,076
in "on fleek," as the Internet says.

211
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,545
Oh! But, Darryl, what's wrong?

212
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:30,814
(Sighs) Shut the door.

213
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:32,249
If anyone needs me,

214
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,351
I'll be in here helping Darryl.

215
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:35,453
We're all clear?

216
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:36,677
Great.

217
00:07:38,507 --> 00:07:39,890
What's wrong, buddy?

218
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,358
It's my stupid wife Stacey.

219
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,826
She's trying to get primary
custody of my daughter.

220
00:07:43,585 --> 00:07:45,028
Jiminy Christmas.

221
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,695
I'm the primary parent.

222
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,046
I spend way more Te with
Madison than she does.

223
00:07:49,071 --> 00:07:49,770
I mean...

224
00:07:49,892 --> 00:07:51,425
She's just jealous.

225
00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:53,257
I mean, what if I lose Madison?

226
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,207
Oh, I'm in my own private hell.

227
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:01,845
Well, it doesn't have to
be private anymore, Darryl.

228
00:08:01,847 --> 00:08:02,846
Come on.

229
00:08:02,848 --> 00:08:04,414
Everybody...

230
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,482
I have an announcement to make.

231
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:06,483
Gather around, it's very exciting.

232
00:08:06,882 --> 00:08:08,151
As we all know,

233
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:10,020
our boss, Darryl Whitefeather,

234
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:12,256
has been going through
a very terrible divorce.

235
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,724
Yeah, you know, the "private" part

236
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,626
- wasn't the part I wanted to change. 
- Okay. Yeah.

237
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,804
So I have decided to represent him

238
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:19,963
in his divorce case.

239
00:08:19,965 --> 00:08:21,965
What? You're gonna represent me?

240
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:23,433
Oh, my gosh, that's all I ever wanted!

241
00:08:23,435 --> 00:08:25,102
I mean, you said "no" so many times...

242
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:27,070
Bup-bup-bup,
bup-bup-bup. (Chuckles)

243
00:08:27,072 --> 00:08:29,039
No, I mean, I asked
yesterday and you said, "no!"

244
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,507
Bup-bup-bup-bup! I
was thinking about it.

245
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:31,808
Okay. It's just that, you
know, you said "never..."

246
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,410
So, daddy, you ready to get to work?

247
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:34,911
- Mm-hmm! You bet. 
- Come on.

248
00:08:34,913 --> 00:08:37,447
'Carr and I need focus so hard on the case

249
00:08:37,449 --> 00:08:39,483
we will be out of the
office for the next few days.

250
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:40,757
Um, where are we going?

251
00:08:40,782 --> 00:08:42,460
- It doesn't matter. Okay?
- No.

252
00:08:42,485 --> 00:08:43,929
Hey. Wait a minute.

253
00:08:43,954 --> 00:08:45,122
W-what about the Caswick case?

254
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,290
We need your help.

255
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,924
What are we supposed to do?

256
00:08:47,926 --> 00:08:49,726
Maybe actually do your job.

257
00:08:49,728 --> 00:08:50,560
Hmm.

258
00:08:50,562 --> 00:08:51,561
You can't go.

259
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:52,796
I need approvals.

260
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,265
Well, Paula knows the
office, like, inside and out.

261
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:57,167
She can handle it all.

262
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,602
Paula's not a lawyer.

263
00:08:58,604 --> 00:08:59,803
She's a paralegal.

264
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,706
You mean she can handle
the filing and the coffee.

265
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,740
(Tim chuckles)

266
00:09:03,742 --> 00:09:05,342
No, Tim.

267
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:06,710
I mean she can supervise everything,

268
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,023
including the cases.

269
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,346
Yeah, Paula's in charge.

270
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,380
Cool, Darryl?

271
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:11,601
Yeah. Sure.

272
00:09:11,626 --> 00:09:13,626
Great. Knock 'em dead.

273
00:09:17,378 --> 00:09:19,545
(Sighs)

274
00:09:39,937 --> 00:09:41,478
Ow.

275
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,828
A shard got in my eye.

276
00:09:42,853 --> 00:09:43,742
I need some eyewash!

277
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:44,966
Karen!

278
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,217
You passive-aggressive,

279
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,281
miserable piece of garbage.

280
00:09:49,306 --> 00:09:52,585
Shut your garbage face!

281
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,559
(Giggles)

282
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:56,927
You heard what they said.

283
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,007
I'm in charge now.

284
00:10:01,238 --> 00:10:05,473
And we are going to get some
friggin' work done around here!

285
00:10:05,537 --> 00:10:07,938
Do you hear me?

286
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,726
Now go.

287
00:10:14,384 --> 00:10:16,551
(Indistinct chatter)

288
00:10:17,758 --> 00:10:19,959
(Cheering)

289
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:24,821
Um, why are we here?

290
00:10:24,823 --> 00:10:27,557
Uh, they have great coffee and free wi-fi.

291
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:29,140
Um, so does our office.

292
00:10:29,205 --> 00:10:30,104
Hi.

293
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,795
Hi. Yeah.

294
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:32,863
We'd like two coffees over here.

295
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,231
And you know what? Just keep it coming,

296
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,932
'cause I'm gonna be doing a lot of helping.

297
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:37,000
Thanks.

298
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:38,502
I like your shirt.

299
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:39,870
(Sighs)

300
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,305
So, Darryl, let's talk
about this arbitration,

301
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:44,441
where I'll save your daughter.

302
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:45,776
Darryl: Save her?

303
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:47,611
Is she in danger? I mean,
did something happen?

304
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,012
No, no, Darryl, that's why I'm here,

305
00:10:49,014 --> 00:10:51,314
is to protect you from your
evil wife's machinations.

306
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:52,649
Okay, look, the truth is, I just want

307
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:53,717
whatever's best for Madison.

308
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,185
I mean, I just want us all to get along.

309
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:56,640
Hey, chief, just a sec.

310
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,318
Hey.

311
00:11:00,343 --> 00:11:02,159
Hey, can we get some waters

312
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,494
and a breakfast burrito just for me?

313
00:11:04,496 --> 00:11:06,129
I'm sorry if we're loud over there.

314
00:11:06,131 --> 00:11:07,597
I'm just helping out a friend;

315
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:09,166
a little pro bones work as I like to say.

316
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,634
(Whispers): It's Darryl and his divorce.

317
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:12,369
- He has a kid, right? 
- Yeah, that's why I'm help...

318
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,718
Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.

319
00:11:13,743 --> 00:11:16,744
I don't know what you're up
to, but this is about a family.

320
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:18,068
This isn't about you.

321
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:19,443
No, I'm aware.

322
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,778
I mean, as a child of
divorce, I understand that...

323
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,914
Oh, spare me, please.

324
00:11:25,796 --> 00:11:27,517
Do you forgive me yet?

325
00:11:28,445 --> 00:11:30,798
<i>Josh: Forgive me,
father, for I have sinned.</i>

326
00:11:31,382 --> 00:11:33,790
I haven't been to
confession in three years.

327
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:35,792
Priest: Hmm, my son.

328
00:11:35,794 --> 00:11:37,427
You must repent

329
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:40,507
and do 5,000 hail Marys.

330
00:11:41,062 --> 00:11:42,299
That's so many.

331
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:45,068
And, uh, 400...

332
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,303
Keg stands, dude!

333
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:47,370
It's me, bro!

334
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:49,906
Father Brah, no way!

335
00:11:49,908 --> 00:11:51,274
Yeah, I got promoted.

336
00:11:51,276 --> 00:11:53,076
I can finally do confession now.

337
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:54,511
That's amazing, Father Brah.

338
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:55,645
Thanks, man, I've been meaning to say

339
00:11:55,647 --> 00:11:57,581
thank you so much for the nickname.

340
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,849
Oh, yeah, glad you like it.

341
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,784
It was super easy to come up with.

342
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,953
Father Joseph, father Bro-seph,

343
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,654
Father bro, Father
Brah... Bam! Psh!

344
00:12:05,328 --> 00:12:07,491
I mean, attendance has
shot through the roof

345
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:08,792
- since you did that, man. 
- Nice!

346
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:11,261
Now, what's up, man? What can I do for you?

347
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,163
So, I've been with Valencia for, like,

348
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,131
forever and I know we're
meant to be together.

349
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:16,967
But someone recently said something to me.

350
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,201
I don't want to say who.

351
00:12:18,203 --> 00:12:19,336
Greg.

352
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,004
- It was Greg, mm-hmm.
- He said something to me

353
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:23,707
that on one level I didn't think was true.

354
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,609
<i>But on another level it is true.</i>

355
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,411
So there are, like, two things
going in in my brain right now.

356
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:30,085
Two things are a lot for one brain.

357
00:12:30,437 --> 00:12:31,921
Okay, so let's simplify.

358
00:12:32,671 --> 00:12:35,218
What's really bothering you?

359
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,122
Just tell me straight
up from your heart, dude.

360
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:44,328
I think I might be attracted
to someone besides Valencia.

361
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:49,327
Don't get me wrong.

362
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:50,857
I still love Valencia.

363
00:12:50,882 --> 00:12:52,983
But there is another girl.

364
00:12:53,008 --> 00:12:54,775
Yeah, I hear you, J-town, I mean,

365
00:12:54,777 --> 00:12:56,410
look, let...
Tell you what.

366
00:12:56,412 --> 00:12:58,843
Let's take this to a higher court.

367
00:13:01,664 --> 00:13:04,684
So, you're saying that one
day, you want to marry Valencia,

368
00:13:04,687 --> 00:13:06,453
have kidlings and, like,

369
00:13:06,455 --> 00:13:07,821
live happily ever after.

370
00:13:07,823 --> 00:13:09,423
Right, so then, when I find myself

371
00:13:09,425 --> 00:13:11,125
thinking about this other girl...

372
00:13:11,127 --> 00:13:12,893
- That's a foul, dude. 
- I know, I feel terrible!

373
00:13:12,895 --> 00:13:14,661
No, I mean, like, like, watch your elbows.

374
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:17,231
Oh. So, I think about Rebecca's smile,

375
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:20,300
you know, her hair, her boobs, her butt,

376
00:13:20,302 --> 00:13:22,169
her... boobs.

377
00:13:22,171 --> 00:13:23,904
Well, it's natural to
have those feelings, dawg.

378
00:13:23,906 --> 00:13:25,606
(Both grunt)

379
00:13:26,578 --> 00:13:29,777
But it's not just that
Rebecca makes me feel great.

380
00:13:30,257 --> 00:13:33,914
You know, she believes in me
in a way that nobody else does.

381
00:13:34,187 --> 00:13:35,851
Well, that's... major.

382
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:38,118
And that's not all.

383
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,554
I do other things that are sinful.

384
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,290
I've had premarital sex.

385
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:45,092
Lots of it. And sometimes I watch

386
00:13:45,094 --> 00:13:48,061
adult content and I take care of myself.

387
00:13:48,063 --> 00:13:50,864
And I don't mean in the
vitamin/exercising kind of way.

388
00:13:50,866 --> 00:13:52,099
Okay, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.

389
00:13:52,101 --> 00:13:53,382
Look, dude.

390
00:13:53,407 --> 00:13:55,374
The way I see
it... you're lucky.

391
00:13:55,718 --> 00:13:58,405
No, man, this moral crisis you're having?

392
00:13:58,407 --> 00:13:59,840
It's a chance to look within.

393
00:13:59,842 --> 00:14:03,477
Like, God is personally inviting
you to take stock of your life.

394
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:05,979
So, here's an assignment, okay?

395
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:08,015
For, like, the next 24 hours,

396
00:14:08,017 --> 00:14:10,050
what I want you to do is
write down all the thoughts

397
00:14:10,052 --> 00:14:11,585
that you think are sinful.

398
00:14:12,656 --> 00:14:13,687
Okay.

399
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:15,460
God is challenging you, man.

400
00:14:15,984 --> 00:14:17,468
It's an opportunity.

401
00:14:17,805 --> 00:14:20,873
- Just like this is an opportunity. 
- Oh, come on.

402
00:14:20,898 --> 00:14:23,007
Oh, nothing but net!

403
00:14:23,032 --> 00:14:24,820
And Christ!

404
00:14:25,434 --> 00:14:29,203
♪ Oh-oh, oh-oh,
oh-oh, oh-oh... ♪

405
00:14:30,164 --> 00:14:33,173
<i>Darryl: Oh, Madison, she
was such a fussy baby.</i>

406
00:14:33,175 --> 00:14:34,608
I mean, she would cry all night long.

407
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,110
I mean, these ear-piercing
screams, but you know what?

408
00:14:37,453 --> 00:14:38,312
Are you listening to me?

409
00:14:38,314 --> 00:14:39,680
Yeah, sorry, I-I am.

410
00:14:39,682 --> 00:14:41,548
Anyway, she had this first grade teacher,

411
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,517
- who was an amazing listener... 
- Hey! Hey!

412
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,285
Uh... do you know where Greg went?

413
00:14:45,287 --> 00:14:46,420
He went home.

414
00:14:46,422 --> 00:14:47,254
Wait, how'd I miss him?

415
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,022
He went through the back door?

416
00:14:49,024 --> 00:14:49,976
Wait.

417
00:14:50,008 --> 00:14:51,474
I know you...
You're that lady

418
00:14:51,499 --> 00:14:53,037
on the dartboard in the storage room.

419
00:14:53,062 --> 00:14:53,827
Oh.

420
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:54,895
(Laughing)

421
00:14:54,897 --> 00:14:56,296
That's how we kid.

422
00:14:56,298 --> 00:14:57,531
Me and Greg, yeah.

423
00:14:57,533 --> 00:14:58,999
We make a joke about the other per on

424
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:01,034
in another room that the
other person will never see,

425
00:15:01,036 --> 00:15:03,537
and then we never tell
the other person about it.

426
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:05,138
It's so funny.

427
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,306
Oh, give him my regards.

428
00:15:06,308 --> 00:15:07,546
Nice meeting you.

429
00:15:07,571 --> 00:15:08,648
Uh-huh.

430
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,079
Okay.

431
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:13,714
You know, I'm...

432
00:15:13,716 --> 00:15:15,816
- I think I got to call it a day. 
- Oh...

433
00:15:15,818 --> 00:15:17,584
I got to go home and think about this case.

434
00:15:17,586 --> 00:15:19,253
I just don't know if
there's enough evidence here

435
00:15:19,255 --> 00:15:20,888
to redo the custody arrangements.

436
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,322
Oh, but you have to come up with something.

437
00:15:22,324 --> 00:15:23,590
<i>Wait!</i>

438
00:15:23,592 --> 00:15:25,336
Rebecca, look.

439
00:15:25,361 --> 00:15:28,414
I need you to understand
this is not just another case.

440
00:15:28,473 --> 00:15:30,674
And this is not just a favor
you're doing for your boss.

441
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:32,266
This means everything to me.

442
00:15:32,562 --> 00:15:34,201
Madison is my sun and my moon.

443
00:15:34,203 --> 00:15:37,337
She is the candle in the
window that guides me home.

444
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:38,939
She's the cream in my coffee!

445
00:15:38,941 --> 00:15:40,674
Okay, dude, I got to stop you, sorry.

446
00:15:40,676 --> 00:15:42,843
Uh, maybe it's because my
father's an abandoning coward.

447
00:15:42,845 --> 00:15:44,645
Could be that, but I feel like

448
00:15:44,647 --> 00:15:46,113
you should dial back

449
00:15:46,115 --> 00:15:49,046
the whole daddy-daughter love thing.

450
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:52,152
It sounds a little like... Amber Alert.

451
00:15:52,154 --> 00:15:54,288
What?! What are you talking about?

452
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,856
A father's love for a daughter

453
00:15:55,858 --> 00:15:57,591
is one of the purest loves on earth!

454
00:15:57,593 --> 00:15:58,992
Oh, no.

455
00:15:59,453 --> 00:16:02,429
I just wish I could explain
how I feel about her.

456
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,796
I'm gonna try.

Yes.

507
00:18:26,357 --> 00:18:28,036
Is Madison home from school yet?

00:18:28,744 --> 00:18:30,110
Don't look so sad.

00:18:30,112 --> 00:18:32,312
You will get your
pho... thank you.

510
00:18:32,314 --> 00:18:34,314
You'll get them back at
the end of the workday,

511
00:18:34,316 --> 00:18:36,216
which may be midnight.

512
00:18:36,218 --> 00:18:38,085
I got to go... some
bitch wants my phone.

513
00:18:38,087 --> 00:18:39,920
Oh, my God, I'm gonna strangle you.

514
00:18:39,922 --> 00:18:41,288
Put it in. Put it in. Put it in the box!

515
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,522
Thank you.

516
00:18:47,096 --> 00:18:48,695
This is my gumball machine!

517
00:18:48,697 --> 00:18:50,430
It is not your gumball machine!

518
00:18:50,432 --> 00:18:52,499
- It is everybody's gumball machine. 
- No!

519
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:56,103
You are not Don Draper!

520
00:19:00,482 --> 00:19:02,776
Darryl is so damn disorganized.

521
00:19:02,778 --> 00:19:06,346
Some of the papers in here are so old.

522
00:19:06,794 --> 00:19:07,981
Oh, good news.

523
00:19:07,983 --> 00:19:10,117
I found a coupon from Blockbuster.

524
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:12,452
<i>The Color Purple is now
available on laser-disc.</i>

525
00:19:19,536 --> 00:19:21,044
Okay, that's strange.

526
00:19:21,069 --> 00:19:22,639
Paula, Paula?

527
00:19:22,664 --> 00:19:24,431
I have a weird tampon thing happening.

528
00:19:24,433 --> 00:19:26,982
Bup, bup, bup! Karen, shut it down.

529
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,104
Oh, Tim.

530
00:19:50,562 --> 00:19:51,786
Oh.

531
00:19:53,075 --> 00:19:54,227
Hi, Paula.

532
00:19:54,229 --> 00:19:56,163
So now you know my name.

533
00:19:56,165 --> 00:19:57,931
Interesting.

534
00:19:57,933 --> 00:19:59,399
Listen, I'm sorry about...

535
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:02,012
Bup, bup, bup, bup. Did you say "about"

536
00:20:02,037 --> 00:20:05,639
or "a-boot"?

537
00:20:05,841 --> 00:20:07,541
That's right, Timster.

538
00:20:07,543 --> 00:20:09,209
I know the truth.

539
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:10,977
Please, you can't tell anyone.

540
00:20:10,979 --> 00:20:12,279
Don't tell anyone what?

541
00:20:12,281 --> 00:20:14,281
That you're not an American citizen?

542
00:20:14,283 --> 00:20:16,516
That you've been working
in this country illegally

543
00:20:16,518 --> 00:20:19,853
on an expired visa, because
you're really Canadian?

544
00:20:19,855 --> 00:20:21,388
Paula, please, I need this job.

545
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,811
I alienated everyone
in my firm in Winnipeg.

546
00:20:23,836 --> 00:20:25,903
- Shocking. 
- I came out to L.A. for a convention.

547
00:20:25,928 --> 00:20:28,261
I met Darryl at a strip club.

548
00:20:28,263 --> 00:20:29,529
We would never speak of again.

549
00:20:29,531 --> 00:20:31,898
I gave him some fake
documents and he never noticed!

550
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,200
You know what?

551
00:20:33,202 --> 00:20:35,168
I saw through that phony
work permit right away.

552
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,803
I've been at the firm ever since,

553
00:20:36,805 --> 00:20:37,938
watching my long Os

554
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,506
and pretending not to like hockey.

555
00:20:39,508 --> 00:20:40,907
It's been so difficult.

556
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:43,376
Yeah, no, it sounds harrowing.

557
00:20:43,378 --> 00:20:45,575
Look, I know you hate me.

558
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,888
And now you got a reason to get rid of me.

559
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,713
But I am begging you.

560
00:20:49,651 --> 00:20:51,099
Paula, what are you gonna do?

561
00:20:51,158 --> 00:20:52,868
I don't know.

562
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:55,288
Because I'm gonna have to talk to Pamela,

563
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,872
and she is a real bitch.

564
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,033
This one is Snail-y Minaj.

565
00:21:07,035 --> 00:21:10,070
This one is Snail-or Swift.

566
00:21:10,072 --> 00:21:11,864
And this one is Snail-y Rae Jepsen.

567
00:21:11,889 --> 00:21:13,188
(Chuckles)

568
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,041
Maybe you should name one escargot.

569
00:21:17,045 --> 00:21:18,278
I'm sorry.

570
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,346
That was... it was a...

571
00:21:19,348 --> 00:21:20,834
(Chuckling): It was a joke, get it?

572
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:23,208
You're here to talk
about my parents, right?

573
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:26,063
Rebecca, you know what,
I'm-I'm not too sure about this.

574
00:21:26,088 --> 00:21:27,187
Look, honey, I just don't want to put you

575
00:21:27,189 --> 00:21:28,255
in the middle of this whole thing...

576
00:21:28,257 --> 00:21:29,389
You know, Madison,

577
00:21:29,391 --> 00:21:32,146
I think we can tell
the judge what you want.

578
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:34,794
Oh, that's easy... I
want to live with my dad.

579
00:21:36,482 --> 00:21:38,832
"I want to live with Madison's dad.

580
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:40,800
He's the best."

581
00:21:40,802 --> 00:21:42,135
Well, thank you, Iggy A-snail-ya.

582
00:21:42,137 --> 00:21:43,239
I appreciate that.

583
00:21:43,312 --> 00:21:47,716
So, Madison, I'm here to
help you get what you want.

584
00:21:47,743 --> 00:21:50,919
So if there's anything you could think of

585
00:21:50,944 --> 00:21:53,364
that would help me win this case...

586
00:21:53,433 --> 00:21:55,500
- Well, let me see. 
- Yeah, uh-huh.

587
00:21:55,525 --> 00:21:57,091
- You know what, this is a mistake. 
- It's fine. No, shh.

588
00:21:57,219 --> 00:21:58,716
Madison: (Gasps) Oh.

589
00:21:58,741 --> 00:22:01,221
Well, sometimes my mom
leaves me home by myself,

590
00:22:01,223 --> 00:22:03,189
and I went on her iPad
to see where she was,

591
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:06,536
and turns out she goes
to a motel with her boss.

592
00:22:14,046 --> 00:22:15,521
That's something, right?

593
00:22:19,888 --> 00:22:21,857
Oh, come on, Tim's a dick.

594
00:22:22,287 --> 00:22:24,113
We can finally get rid of him,

595
00:22:24,138 --> 00:22:25,684
send him back to the land

596
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:27,442
of universal health care and nice people.

597
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,599
I know.

598
00:22:29,624 --> 00:22:31,419
He's got kids, and they're cute.

599
00:22:31,896 --> 00:22:33,380
They're probably jerks, too.

600
00:22:33,492 --> 00:22:36,026
Like, little Justin Bieber jerks.

601
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,310
You know it's true.

602
00:22:37,335 --> 00:22:39,871
Wow, this place is so quiet and tidy.

603
00:22:39,896 --> 00:22:40,864
What'd you do?

604
00:22:40,889 --> 00:22:42,122
She broke our spirit.

605
00:22:42,733 --> 00:22:43,966
Great.

606
00:22:46,443 --> 00:22:48,243
Paula: Okay, you're not gonna believe

607
00:22:48,245 --> 00:22:49,578
what has been happening around here.

608
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,514
First of all, Karen has been
hoarding all the calcium chews.

609
00:22:52,516 --> 00:22:54,182
Okay, Paula, I really want
to hear about all this,

610
00:22:54,184 --> 00:22:55,550
but I actually got to get to the courthouse.

611
00:22:55,552 --> 00:22:57,519
I scheduled an emergency
hearing for Darryl today.

612
00:22:57,521 --> 00:22:58,453
A hearing already?

613
00:22:58,455 --> 00:22:59,655
Yeah. Wow.

614
00:22:59,657 --> 00:23:01,657
Yeah, I'm gonna bust this case wide open.

615
00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:04,359
And when I do...
Suck it, Greg.

616
00:23:04,361 --> 00:23:06,461
(Grunts rhythmically)

617
00:23:07,564 --> 00:23:09,531
♪ Greg's gonna suck it,
Greg's gonna suck it ♪

618
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:11,133
♪ Greg's gonna suck
it... ah, yeah! ♪

619
00:23:11,818 --> 00:23:13,735
Your honor, what is the emergency?

620
00:23:13,737 --> 00:23:14,770
I have a business trip to the Caymans.

621
00:23:14,772 --> 00:23:16,772
My plane is leaving today.

622
00:23:16,774 --> 00:23:18,779
Your honor, may we begin?

623
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:22,411
What's up, YouTubers?

624
00:23:22,413 --> 00:23:25,180
<i>It's episode three of
The Snailysitters Club.</i>

625
00:23:25,182 --> 00:23:26,548
She has a YouTube channel?

626
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,582
I know, right?

627
00:23:27,584 --> 00:23:29,251
Everybody has a YouTube channel.

628
00:23:29,253 --> 00:23:31,219
Even weird Karen from my office.

629
00:23:31,221 --> 00:23:33,622
So tonight, just like last Friday,

630
00:23:33,624 --> 00:23:36,224
my mom is with her boss at the motel,

631
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:38,804
and I'm with the best
babysitters in the world...

632
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:41,240
My snails, holla!

633
00:23:41,849 --> 00:23:44,333
This week is super exciting

634
00:23:44,335 --> 00:23:47,536
'cause me and my snails
are gonna make s'mores

635
00:23:47,538 --> 00:23:50,672
on the gas stove. (Chuckles)

636
00:23:50,674 --> 00:23:52,007
Left alone.

637
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:54,009
Gas stove.

638
00:23:54,011 --> 00:23:55,857
Some mores.

639
00:23:55,882 --> 00:23:57,782
Your honor, she is very mature.

640
00:23:58,232 --> 00:24:00,177
And I was only gone for a couple minutes.

641
00:24:00,651 --> 00:24:01,950
Half hour at the most.

642
00:24:01,952 --> 00:24:03,685
How long were you sleeping with him? Hmm?

643
00:24:03,687 --> 00:24:06,188
You worked there for five years.

644
00:24:07,235 --> 00:24:09,068
The whole five years?

645
00:24:09,497 --> 00:24:12,036
Yeah, but he doesn't talk
about his feelings all the time.

646
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,710
And he doesn't cry at cat food commercials.

647
00:24:14,735 --> 00:24:17,060
Your honor, the evidence
of neglect is irrefutable.

648
00:24:17,267 --> 00:24:19,001
Ms. Bunch, I have to agree with you.

649
00:24:19,003 --> 00:24:20,302
Mr. Whitefeather,

650
00:24:20,304 --> 00:24:21,370
I'm granting you

651
00:24:21,372 --> 00:24:22,738
temporary full custody of your daughter.

652
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,669
(Whispering): Yes.

653
00:24:23,694 --> 00:24:26,986
Mrs. Whitefeather, you will
have supervised visitation

654
00:24:27,011 --> 00:24:29,311
until the custody arrangements
are fully finalized.

655
00:24:29,313 --> 00:24:30,786
Supervi...

656
00:24:32,316 --> 00:24:33,435
Great.

657
00:24:33,784 --> 00:24:35,084
Thank you so much

658
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:36,708

this matter, your honor.

659
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:38,723

00:26:48,185 --> 00:26:49,451
Oh, look at Madison.

711
00:26:49,453 --> 00:26:51,386
- She's so happy. 
- Darryl: I know. It's great.

712
00:26:51,388 --> 00:26:54,089
I just... my whole life was a lie,

713
00:26:54,091 --> 00:26:55,490
but (Chuckles) I'll get used to that.

714
00:26:55,492 --> 00:26:56,491
Yeah, you will!

715
00:26:56,493 --> 00:26:57,959
Yeah! That's the spirit.

716
00:26:58,795 --> 00:27:00,629
Barkeep.

717
00:27:00,631 --> 00:27:02,081
Your finest champagne.

718
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,408
And, ooh, let's see, a mint
chocolate chip ice cream

719
00:27:05,433 --> 00:27:06,732
for the young lady.

720
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,204
Sorry, (Chuckles) Context...

721
00:27:09,206 --> 00:27:12,541
May I present to you a family reunited.

722
00:27:12,543 --> 00:27:13,575
What do you suggest?

723
00:27:14,406 --> 00:27:16,906
I got Darryl temporary custody.

724
00:27:17,621 --> 00:27:18,480
Okay.

725
00:27:18,482 --> 00:27:19,527
So?

726
00:27:19,883 --> 00:27:23,985
Well, "so"... (Chuckles) You said
that I was a terrible person.

727
00:27:23,987 --> 00:27:27,136
But clearly now I'm not.

728
00:27:27,224 --> 00:27:30,808
You're... never mind.

729
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,621
What do you mean, "never mind"?

730
00:27:33,964 --> 00:27:35,574
What do you mean, "never mind"?

731
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,366
Rebecca: Son of a...

732
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,401
Hey!

733
00:27:39,403 --> 00:27:41,803
My God, I don't understand you.

734
00:27:41,805 --> 00:27:43,672
What are you doing? You can't come in here.

735
00:27:43,674 --> 00:27:46,007
Oh, just listen to me... I'm out
there trying to help somebody,

736
00:27:46,009 --> 00:27:47,342
and all I ask is for your forgiveness,

737
00:27:47,344 --> 00:27:48,410
and you won't even give it to me.

738
00:27:48,412 --> 00:27:49,347
Why?

739
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,527
Wow.

740
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,383
Either you truly hate me or
you're super good at darts.

741
00:27:55,816 --> 00:27:56,785
Why do you care what I think?

742
00:27:56,787 --> 00:27:58,086
I'm not your priest.

743
00:27:58,088 --> 00:28:00,088
I just care, okay?

744
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,390
Look, I know... I know that I messed up.

745
00:28:02,392 --> 00:28:05,026
And I know that it was, like, so wrong

746
00:28:05,028 --> 00:28:06,761
to sleep with another guy on our date.

747
00:28:06,763 --> 00:28:08,396
I made a mistake.

748
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:11,433
And so please just forgive
me, because I'm imperfect.

749
00:28:11,435 --> 00:28:12,634
Why is that so hard?

750
00:28:12,636 --> 00:28:13,969
Rebecca, let me be clear here.

751
00:28:13,971 --> 00:28:15,270
Unless you
can Un-have-sex

752
00:28:15,272 --> 00:28:17,005
with that guy you ditched
me for on our date,

753
00:28:17,007 --> 00:28:18,273
I don't care what you do.

754
00:28:18,275 --> 00:28:20,108
You could save the world, Avengers-style.

755
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,486
So this is about sex.

756
00:28:21,777 --> 00:28:22,877
Why didn't you say so?

757
00:28:22,879 --> 00:28:24,480
That's an easy thing to rectify.

758
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:26,271
Let's do it, let's do it. It's safe...
I'm on the ring.

759
00:28:26,296 --> 00:28:27,283
What are you...? No.

760
00:28:27,308 --> 00:28:28,717
Yeah, let's get these puppies
out of the cage. Stop it, stop it.

761
00:28:28,719 --> 00:28:29,794
Let these puppies
out of their crate.

762
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:31,152
Stop it, what is...
what is wrong with you?

763
00:28:31,154 --> 00:28:32,787
I-I'm supposed to forget what happened

764
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:36,157
because you took a case and
got some guy temporary custody?

765
00:28:38,777 --> 00:28:39,928
"Temporary."

766
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:40,962
I get it.

767
00:28:40,964 --> 00:28:41,930
What?

768
00:28:41,932 --> 00:28:43,265
I get it, I get it.

769
00:28:43,267 --> 00:28:44,633
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.

770
00:28:45,371 --> 00:28:47,097
I don't get it. What?

771
00:28:47,122 --> 00:28:49,748
Okay, so new plan.

772
00:28:49,773 --> 00:28:52,474
I'm not gonna get you temporary custody.

773
00:28:52,476 --> 00:28:55,176
Instead, how would you like it

774
00:28:55,178 --> 00:28:57,441
if I got you permanent custody?

775
00:28:57,443 --> 00:28:58,371
What? Wait.

776
00:28:58,396 --> 00:29:00,259
Yep, that's right. Mmm.

777
00:29:00,284 --> 00:29:02,317
(Slurred): I'm gonna get
you permanent custody.

778
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:03,618
I'm gonna do it right now.

779
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,953
(Speaks indistinctly)

780
00:29:04,955 --> 00:29:07,188
I missed that part.

781
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:09,157
Sorry, that was cryptic, let me explain.

782
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:12,193
I'm gonna go to the bank, withdraw $10,000,

783
00:29:12,195 --> 00:29:14,129
and plant it in your wife's suitcase,

784
00:29:14,131 --> 00:29:15,363
because it's illegal to take

785
00:29:15,365 --> 00:29:16,698
that amount of money over the border.

786
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,133
So when she tries to fly
to the Cayman Islands,

787
00:29:18,135 --> 00:29:19,034
they'll find it and arrest her,

788
00:29:19,036 --> 00:29:20,135
and you'll get permanent custody.

789
00:29:20,137 --> 00:29:21,369
That's all cleared up.

790
00:29:21,371 --> 00:29:22,871
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bank. Bye!

791
00:29:23,224 --> 00:29:24,683
Oh, she's bananas.

792
00:30:00,152 --> 00:30:01,751
What the hell are you doing?!

793
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,291
What up?

794
00:30:08,316 --> 00:30:09,726
'Sup?

795
00:30:09,728 --> 00:30:10,960
- You got a game? 
- Yeah.

796
00:30:10,962 --> 00:30:13,096
Interfaith League, playing
The Chosen Ones today.

797
00:30:13,098 --> 00:30:15,231
Cantor Goldstein's got this killer move.

798
00:30:15,233 --> 00:30:17,097
He calls it the torah,
'cause you can't touch it.

799
00:30:17,535 --> 00:30:19,752
Uh, here-here's my list of sins.

800
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:21,041
Uh, I printed it out.

801
00:30:21,066 --> 00:30:22,839
You did it,
man... good on you.

802
00:30:22,841 --> 00:30:24,541
All right.

803
00:30:25,355 --> 00:30:27,877
Okay, so you went to the mall
and you saw a sexy mannequin

804
00:30:27,879 --> 00:30:30,246
and you wanted to have sex with it.

805
00:30:30,248 --> 00:30:32,749
And then you saw another sexy mannequin

806
00:30:32,751 --> 00:30:35,318
and you wanted to have
sex with that one, too.

807
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,921
And then you saw a sexy girl at the mall

808
00:30:37,923 --> 00:30:41,658
and you wanted her to watch you have sex

809
00:30:41,793 --> 00:30:43,893
with two sexy mannequins.

810
00:30:45,564 --> 00:30:48,231
According to this list, you
thought about Rebecca a lot.

811
00:30:48,233 --> 00:30:49,730
<i>Like, a lot a lot.</i>

812
00:30:50,652 --> 00:30:51,935
And all day yesterday,

813
00:30:51,937 --> 00:30:54,604
did you act on any of
these sinful thoughts?

814
00:30:54,606 --> 00:30:55,714
No.

815
00:30:56,508 --> 00:30:58,775
Bro-heem, you're good.

816
00:30:59,261 --> 00:31:02,238
What matters is what you
do, not what you think.

817
00:31:02,481 --> 00:31:06,216
What God cares about are our actions.

818
00:31:06,597 --> 00:31:07,972
That's all.

819
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:12,285
So you admire Rebecca for
her brains and her beauty.

820
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:13,800
I understand that.

821
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:15,527
What's important is...

822
00:31:16,088 --> 00:31:18,655
What are you gonna do about these feelings?

823
00:31:25,136 --> 00:31:26,102
What happened?

824
00:31:26,104 --> 00:31:27,170
Is there something wrong with Madison?

825
00:31:27,172 --> 00:31:28,137
Is that why you're here?

826
00:31:29,308 --> 00:31:30,106
No.

827
00:31:30,108 --> 00:31:33,011
You know what? I'm here for justice.

828
00:31:33,778 --> 00:31:34,932
Okay.

829
00:31:34,957 --> 00:31:37,424
I don't know what that 
means, but please stop.

830
00:31:37,449 --> 00:31:38,848
You've taken my daughter away.

831
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:39,916
Isn't that enough?

832
00:31:39,918 --> 00:31:41,199
I haven't taken your daughter away.

833
00:31:41,224 --> 00:31:42,371
You abandoned your daughter.

834
00:31:42,396 --> 00:31:44,949
You left her in a house
with nothing but snails?

835
00:31:44,974 --> 00:31:46,839
I mean, who does
that? Bup-bup-bup!

836
00:31:47,017 --> 00:31:48,464
You have some nerve.

837
00:31:48,515 --> 00:31:49,980
So I made some bad mistakes,

838
00:31:50,005 --> 00:31:52,081
but I do want what's best for my daughter.

839
00:31:52,397 --> 00:31:54,269
I mean, I love her so much.

840
00:31:54,294 --> 00:31:55,927
Do you have any idea how hard it is

841
00:31:55,952 --> 00:31:57,933
to know that your child
prefers their father?

842
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:59,691
Well, no, I don't have kids, personally.

843
00:31:59,716 --> 00:32:01,482
- Shocking. 
- But...

844
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:03,740
I mean, it-it sounds hard.

845
00:32:03,742 --> 00:32:05,074
It all sounds hard.

846
00:32:05,076 --> 00:32:06,809
What would you know about
what I've been through?

847
00:32:06,811 --> 00:32:08,652
You're just some soulless lawyer.

848
00:32:08,847 --> 00:32:10,636
Oh, yeah, I saw you pump your fist

849
00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:12,715
when the judge gave my daughter away.

850
00:32:13,183 --> 00:32:14,817
How dare you?

851
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:16,980
Why in the world would
you even take on this case?

852
00:32:17,005 --> 00:32:19,039
What's wrong with you?

853
00:32:19,242 --> 00:32:20,472
I...

854
00:32:22,097 --> 00:32:24,360
What is wrong with me?

855
00:32:24,362 --> 00:32:26,896
Off the top of my head,
I'd say low self-esteem,

856
00:32:26,898 --> 00:32:28,231
a lack of maternal affection

857
00:32:28,233 --> 00:32:30,533
and a genetic predisposition
for anxiety and depression.

858
00:32:30,535 --> 00:32:31,581
(Sighs)

859
00:32:31,606 --> 00:32:34,173
I did not think that was
where you were gonna go.

860
00:32:34,439 --> 00:32:35,605
God...

861
00:32:36,797 --> 00:32:39,300
Because of that lack

862
00:32:39,421 --> 00:32:41,388
of any parental validation,

863
00:32:41,413 --> 00:32:45,003
I always seek outside
validation from others.

864
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:48,131
And somehow I've made Greg

865
00:32:48,156 --> 00:32:50,371
my new moral arbiter in this town.

866
00:32:52,351 --> 00:32:53,317
Okay.

867
00:32:53,342 --> 00:32:54,441
You know what?

868
00:32:54,825 --> 00:32:56,391
I can fix this.

869
00:32:56,542 --> 00:32:57,644
We can fix this.

870
00:32:57,669 --> 00:32:59,602
Come with me. Come with me.

871
00:33:00,026 --> 00:33:01,746
Who the hell is Greg?

872
00:33:08,121 --> 00:33:09,386
Do you know what?

873
00:33:09,388 --> 00:33:11,363
You have the softest hair.

874
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:13,023
What do you want me to say, people?

875
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:14,558
That she doesn't have the softest hair?

876
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,327
And I don't watch her at
night when she's sleeping?

877
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:17,394
'Cause I do.

878
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:18,964
She's a little angel.

879
00:33:19,425 --> 00:33:20,097
Right?

880
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:21,832
- That's my girl. 
- (Madison giggles)

881
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,834
Mommy! You came to my game!

882
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:25,936
I decided to postpone my trip.

883
00:33:26,058 --> 00:33:28,572
- Oh. 
- You're with the crazy lady.

884
00:33:28,613 --> 00:33:30,386
- Hey... 
- Rebecca: Well, okay.

885
00:33:30,411 --> 00:33:31,876
Crazy is a pejorative term

886
00:33:31,878 --> 00:33:32,977
and it's an over-generalization

887
00:33:32,979 --> 00:33:34,445
of a number of disorders... what?

888
00:33:34,706 --> 00:33:36,947
That was so funny, when you pretended

889
00:33:36,949 --> 00:33:39,817
like you were gonna put
money in my mom's suitcase.

890
00:33:39,819 --> 00:33:40,985
Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.

891
00:33:40,987 --> 00:33:41,986
Okay. So, Darryl...

892
00:33:41,988 --> 00:33:42,920
- Hmm? 
- Stacey and I

893
00:33:42,922 --> 00:33:45,623
had a talk and we agree

894
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:47,424
that we can settle this
custody arrangement together.

895
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:48,926
Stacey: Yeah.

896
00:33:48,928 --> 00:33:50,961
We don't want to damage
Madison with our disagreements.

897
00:33:50,963 --> 00:33:52,763
That can lead to a whole lot of problems.

898
00:33:52,765 --> 00:33:54,198
Ask Rebecca.

899
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,143
Yeah. But don't ask me.

900
00:33:56,168 --> 00:33:57,035
Seriously, don't.

901
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,144
You don't want the whole spiel.

902
00:33:58,169 --> 00:33:59,339
So, yes,

903
00:33:59,364 --> 00:34:00,564
I believe that we can come up with

904
00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:02,050
a fair and equitable arrangement

905
00:34:02,075 --> 00:34:03,741
without involving a judge.

906
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,542
Does that sound good?

907
00:34:06,394 --> 00:34:07,363
Sounds great.

908
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,769
Great.

909
00:34:09,138 --> 00:34:12,440
Stacey, thank you so
much for understanding.

910
00:34:13,401 --> 00:34:14,800
Can I have my cash back now?

911
00:34:14,825 --> 00:34:16,392
(Whispering): I already bought a hot tub.

912
00:34:16,417 --> 00:34:18,016
No...

913
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:20,108
Now, uh, let's go watch your game, guys.

914
00:34:20,133 --> 00:34:21,599
- Yeah! 
- Sure.

915
00:34:21,624 --> 00:34:23,170
There we go.

916
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:25,128

Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.

917

There you go.

918
00:34:27,004 --> 00:34:28,441
She had flyaways.

919
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:30,132
Can't have her walking around like that.

921
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,589
<i>family is important.</i>

922
00:34:35,614 --> 00:34:37,147
I was letting my own self-interest

923
00:34:37,172 --> 00:34:38,269
get in the way of that.

924
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,464
So Stacey and I worked out
what's best for Madison,

925
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:43,652
and, you know, at the end of the day,

926
00:34:43,677 --> 00:34:45,121
I just feel really good about it.

927
00:34:45,146 --> 00:34:47,769
Yeah, you're a good little munchkin.

928
00:34:48,037 --> 00:34:48,894

929

934
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:17,636

936
00:35:19,319 --> 00:35:22,463
You know, I want to turn you in so much,

937

938
00:35:24,223 --> 00:35:26,292

939
00:35:26,319 --> 00:35:27,785
But here's the thing:

940
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:29,261
Your family looks sweet,

941
00:35:29,286 --> 00:35:31,686
and I have no problem ruining your life,

942
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,490
