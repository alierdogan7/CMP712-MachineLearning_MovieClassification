Hey!

61
00:04:23,887 --> 00:04:26,366
Songbird, you come
here tonight,

62
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:27,805
and I'll dance
with you free.

63
00:04:27,806 --> 00:04:30,206
Oh, no, you don't.
You gotta pay me.

64
00:04:30,207 --> 00:04:32,126
Danny, come on.
Your breakfast.

65
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,047
Come on.

66
00:04:36,446 --> 00:04:38,365
Don't let pop catch you
talking to that.

67
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:39,326
Why not?

68
00:04:39,327 --> 00:04:40,766
I'm just being neighborly,

69
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:41,727
and he picked
the neighborhood.

70
00:04:41,728 --> 00:04:43,165
Oh, why don't you
lay off?

71
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,606
He went broke.

72
00:04:44,607 --> 00:04:46,045
The neighborhood
picked him.

73
00:04:46,046 --> 00:04:47,966
Sit down and eat
your breakfast.

74
00:04:49,407 --> 00:04:52,286
Boy, it sure don't feel
like the last day of school.

75
00:04:52,287 --> 00:04:54,685
Everything's so quiet
just like any other day.

76
00:04:54,686 --> 00:04:57,086
What were you expecting,
a 21-gun salute?

77
00:04:57,087 --> 00:04:58,047
Why not?

78
00:04:58,526 --> 00:04:59,966
I mean, at 3:00,
it's all over.

79
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,886
Don't that make it
kind of special?

80
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:06,206
Tomorrow they call my name
and give me a piece of paper.

81
00:05:09,086 --> 00:05:11,005
It's for sure,
isn't it, Danny?

82
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:12,925
I mean, this time, huh?

83
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:14,845
Sure, kid. I'm a cinch.

84
00:05:14,846 --> 00:05:16,765
You said that
last year.

85
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:19,645
Pop went out and
bought all this junk

86
00:05:19,646 --> 00:05:21,086
for a graduation
party,

87
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,526
and then there was
no graduation.

88
00:05:23,007 --> 00:05:25,405
That old Mrs. Pearson,
she's the one that flunked me,

89
00:05:25,406 --> 00:05:27,325
and she'd have done it
again this year,

90
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:29,726
but I showed her.
I showed the old man, too.

91
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,125
He's been waiting a whole
year to have this party.

92
00:05:32,126 --> 00:05:34,045
Now he can stop
bugging me about it.

93
00:05:34,046 --> 00:05:35,486
He doesn't mean
to bug you, Danny.

94
00:05:35,487 --> 00:05:37,885
He wants to be
proud of you.

95
00:05:37,886 --> 00:05:39,327
Sure.

96
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:44,606
I've been thinking a lot
about the old house, Mimi,

97
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,047
and about mom.

98
00:05:46,048 --> 00:05:48,927
I wish she could be here
tomorrow for the graduation.

99
00:05:49,406 --> 00:05:50,366
I really miss her.

100
00:05:50,847 --> 00:05:52,766
I miss her, too.

101
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,165
He misses her the most.

102
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,566
It's a terrible thing to
lean on someone so hard,

103
00:05:57,567 --> 00:05:59,486
you don't know
you're leaning.

104
00:05:59,487 --> 00:06:00,925
Never finding out

105
00:06:00,926 --> 00:06:02,845
until the day she
isn't there anymore.

106
00:06:02,846 --> 00:06:05,725
It's been like stumbling
around in the dark

107
00:06:05,726 --> 00:06:07,645
for him ever since.

108
00:06:07,646 --> 00:06:10,525
When he sits there and
watches you graduate,

109
00:06:10,526 --> 00:06:11,966
he'll have eyes again

110
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,847
for the first time
in 3 years.

111
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:19,166
Well, then I'd better hurry.

112
00:06:20,126 --> 00:06:22,045
Got a whole day's work
ahead of me

113
00:06:22,046 --> 00:06:23,965
between now
and miss Pearson.

114
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,366
How do you think that's
been eating at him, huh?

115
00:06:26,367 --> 00:06:28,765
You working in a joint
like the blue shade?

116
00:06:28,766 --> 00:06:31,645
One man in the family's
gotta have a job.

117
00:06:31,646 --> 00:06:33,086
What's the difference
where you sweep up?

118
00:06:33,087 --> 00:06:35,006
It all looks the same
on a garbage truck.

119
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,926
Danny, you got pa
all wrong.

120
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:38,846
Yeah, me and the world.

121
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,245
Now, look, sis, what
are we fighting for?

122
00:06:41,246 --> 00:06:43,165
It's the last day
of school, okay?

123
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,126
Yeah.

124
00:06:44,126 --> 00:06:45,086
Bye.

125
00:06:45,087 --> 00:06:46,478
Bye.

126
00:07:04,766 --> 00:07:05,726
Morning, Chico.

127
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:06,686
Hi, Danny.

128
00:07:06,686 --> 00:07:07,646
Who's that?

129
00:07:07,646 --> 00:07:08,606
Oh, some of
Maxie's friends.

130
00:07:08,606 --> 00:07:09,566
They've been here
all night.

131
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,005
I couldn't
get rid of 'em.

132
00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:11,966
Try to work around
'em, will you?

133
00:07:12,446 --> 00:07:12,926
See you later.

134
00:07:13,406 --> 00:07:14,366
Okay. See you tonight.

135
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,285
Man: Don't be like that.

136
00:07:16,286 --> 00:07:18,686
Come on, Ronnie,
Maxie said to be nice.

137
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,126
Now be nice, huh?

138
00:07:20,127 --> 00:07:21,565
I am being
nice to you.

139
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,965
I haven't spit in
your eye yet.

140
00:07:23,966 --> 00:07:24,926
That's very funny.

141
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,365
You better do
what Maxie says.

142
00:07:26,366 --> 00:07:28,765
You know, he's
the boss around here.

143
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:30,685
Hey, kid.

144
00:07:30,686 --> 00:07:32,125
What happened
to the music?

145
00:07:32,126 --> 00:07:33,086
Well, the band
went home.

146
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:35,005
How about you?
Can you play the piano?

147
00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:35,966
Nah.

148
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:37,885
Leave him alone.
He's just a busboy.

149
00:07:37,886 --> 00:07:40,285
This joint's got a cabaret
license, ain't it?

150
00:07:40,286 --> 00:07:43,165
I paid my money, and
I want to be entertained.

151
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,126
Come on,
let's dance, honey.

152
00:07:44,606 --> 00:07:45,566
That's enough
entertainment

153
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:47,005
till the real thing
comes along.

154
00:07:47,006 --> 00:07:47,966
The band
went home.

155
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:48,926
That's all right.

156
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,366
Busboy here will
sing us a song.

157
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,285
Hey, come on, kid.
Sing us a song,

158
00:07:52,286 --> 00:07:53,246
and I'll buy you
a drink, huh?

159
00:07:53,247 --> 00:07:54,685
Aw, look, mister,
I got work to do.

160
00:07:54,686 --> 00:07:56,605
I've gotta stack the chairs
and sweep up.

161
00:07:56,606 --> 00:07:59,006
I appreciate your offer,
but I'll be late for school.

162
00:07:59,086 --> 00:07:59,966
School?

163
00:08:01,886 --> 00:08:03,805
The kid goes to school.
Ain't that nice?

164
00:08:03,806 --> 00:08:05,245
I went to school once.

165
00:08:05,246 --> 00:08:07,165
Bartender's school.

166
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,605
Hey, Ronnie,
you ever go to school?

167
00:08:08,606 --> 00:08:11,005
Huh? I said, you ever
go to school?

168
00:08:11,006 --> 00:08:13,885
Wake up, stupid,
I'm talking to you.

169
00:08:13,886 --> 00:08:17,725
No, they never had
to give you lessons.

170
00:08:17,726 --> 00:08:18,686
Why, you--

171
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,126
Look out! Let go
of me, will you?

172
00:08:20,606 --> 00:08:21,566
Forget it.

173
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,485
Okay, okay, take it easy.
I'll sing.

174
00:08:23,486 --> 00:08:25,405
Did you hear that, Ralph?

175
00:08:25,406 --> 00:08:26,846
The kid is gonna sing.

176
00:08:27,246 --> 00:08:28,766
Don't ever try
that again, huh?

177
00:08:32,126 --> 00:08:34,525
All right, what are
you gonna sing?

178
00:08:34,526 --> 00:08:36,446
Sing your school song.

179
00:08:36,926 --> 00:08:38,845
You gotta have
a school song.

180
00:08:38,846 --> 00:08:40,765
An Alma mater.

181
00:08:40,766 --> 00:08:42,685
You know,
the one with the words

182
00:08:42,686 --> 00:08:44,557
about loyal and true.

183
00:08:44,638 --> 00:08:47,005
Well, you heard
the lady.

184
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:48,446

That's real nice,
kid, real nice.

197
00:09:35,006 --> 00:09:36,445
Here.

198
00:09:36,446 --> 00:09:38,846
What do you do
for an encore?

199
00:09:39,326 --> 00:09:40,765
Aw, never mind.

200
00:09:40,766 --> 00:09:43,645
Come on, honey,
let's finish the dance.

201
00:09:43,646 --> 00:09:45,565
We don't need no music.

202
00:09:45,566 --> 00:09:47,006
Stop it!

203
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:48,925
What do you
think I am?

204
00:09:48,926 --> 00:09:50,845
I know who you are
and what you are.

205
00:09:50,846 --> 00:09:51,806
Come here and be quiet.

206
00:09:51,807 --> 00:09:53,726
You know who
and what, huh?

207
00:09:54,046 --> 00:09:56,605
It's a lifetime
study

208
00:09:56,606 --> 00:09:59,005
to find out
who you are.

209
00:09:59,006 --> 00:10:01,886
To thine own
self be true,

210
00:10:02,366 --> 00:10:05,245
and it follows
as the day...

211
00:10:05,246 --> 00:10:08,606
To thine own
self be true...

212
00:10:10,046 --> 00:10:11,966
If you can
afford it.

213
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:14,845
If you'll excuse me,

214
00:10:14,846 --> 00:10:16,285
my mother is waiting up
for me with a hot toddy.

215
00:10:16,286 --> 00:10:17,246
Get out of here.

216
00:10:17,246 --> 00:10:18,206
You never
had a mother.

217
00:10:18,206 --> 00:10:19,166
What's with you,
kid?

218
00:10:19,646 --> 00:10:21,086
You looking for
trouble, too?

219
00:10:23,966 --> 00:10:24,926
No. I'm like the lady,

220
00:10:24,927 --> 00:10:26,365
just looking
to get out of here.

221
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:28,236
Let me go with you.

222
00:10:28,237 --> 00:10:30,765
Okay, get out of here and mind
your own business, huh?

223
00:10:36,398 --> 00:10:37,358
Ronnie: Aah!

224
00:10:37,758 --> 00:10:38,797
Get up!

225
00:10:39,198 --> 00:10:40,238
You're not a baby.

226
00:10:40,717 --> 00:10:42,157
Leave her alone.

227
00:10:42,158 --> 00:10:45,038
Come on.
Get out of here.

228
00:10:49,678 --> 00:10:51,757
Oh, boy.

229
00:10:51,758 --> 00:10:53,678
You're a pretty fancy
performer, ain't you, kid?

230
00:10:56,558 --> 00:10:59,437
Now you know what I do
for an encore.

231
00:10:59,438 --> 00:11:01,358
Go on, get out of here.

232
00:11:04,238 --> 00:11:05,677
Ronnie: Taxi!

233
00:11:14,798 --> 00:11:16,718
Come on, baby,
have a drink, huh?

234
00:11:20,077 --> 00:11:22,477
I guess I'll lose
the job for this.

235
00:11:22,478 --> 00:11:23,916
No, you won't.

236
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,357
They won't tell Maxie.

237
00:11:25,358 --> 00:11:28,237
Maxie doesn't like to have
his merchandise manhandled.

238
00:11:28,238 --> 00:11:30,157
He'll loan me out
for an evening

239
00:11:30,158 --> 00:11:31,118
to be mauled
a little bit,

240
00:11:31,597 --> 00:11:33,997
but when it comes
to a sock in the eye,

241
00:11:33,998 --> 00:11:36,396
that pleasure is for
Maxie Fields alone.

242
00:11:36,397 --> 00:11:37,357
Nice fella.

243
00:11:37,838 --> 00:11:38,798
Maxie?

244
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:39,758
Yeah.

245
00:11:41,678 --> 00:11:43,597
He wouldn't
like you.

246
00:11:43,598 --> 00:11:45,517
You know why?

247
00:11:45,518 --> 00:11:47,437
Because I like you.

248
00:11:47,438 --> 00:11:50,317
Maxie hates
everything I like.

249
00:11:50,318 --> 00:11:53,197
Maxie's
my benefactor.

250
00:11:53,198 --> 00:11:54,636
He's the circus master,

251
00:11:54,637 --> 00:11:57,997
the cheese,
the big cheese.

252
00:11:57,998 --> 00:12:00,396
Big and green
and moldy.

253
00:12:00,397 --> 00:12:01,837
You've had
too much to drink.

254
00:12:01,838 --> 00:12:03,245
You know it's 8:00
in the morning?

255
00:12:03,246 --> 00:12:04,718
I was supposed to be
home by midnight--

256
00:12:05,197 --> 00:12:06,157
I forget whose--

257
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:09,036
Or my convertible
turns into a pumpkin.

258
00:12:09,037 --> 00:12:11,917
Maxie turns everything
into a pumpkin.

259
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:15,756
Danny...

260
00:12:15,757 --> 00:12:17,677
Why don't you
kiss me?

261
00:12:18,158 --> 00:12:20,125
All the wrong
people try to.

262
00:12:20,126 --> 00:12:21,516
Look, we're almost
to the school.

263
00:12:21,517 --> 00:12:23,596
Will you tell me
where you live?

264
00:12:23,597 --> 00:12:27,276
I want to go
to school with you.

265
00:12:27,277 --> 00:12:30,156
I used to love
to go to school.

266
00:12:30,157 --> 00:12:32,076
I was going to be
everything.

267
00:12:32,077 --> 00:12:35,917
A nurse
and a bus driver.

268
00:12:36,877 --> 00:12:38,317
You know what I am?

269
00:12:38,318 --> 00:12:41,197
You're in the circus.

270
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:42,158
That's right.

271
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:45,998
I'm in the circus.

272
00:12:55,598 --> 00:12:57,517
I'm going in
and explain everything.

273
00:12:57,518 --> 00:12:59,437
You're going home,
wherever that is.

274
00:12:59,438 --> 00:13:02,796
Danny, Mrs. Pearson
marked you absent.

275
00:13:02,797 --> 00:13:04,686
Well, we'll show Mrs. Pearson
a thing or two.

276
00:13:04,766 --> 00:13:06,605
Hey, where'd you
pick that up?

277
00:13:06,606 --> 00:13:07,597
Aw, go on.

278
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,997
You ever seen anybody
with a few too many?

279
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,436
Go on.

280
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:13,356
Will you tell the man
where to take you?

281
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:15,276
I'll be a good girl.

282
00:13:15,277 --> 00:13:16,718
If you'll give me
a good morning kiss,

283
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:19,598
I'll tell the man
where I live.

284
00:13:20,077 --> 00:13:21,997
[People laughing
and ribbing]

285
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:24,877
[Whistling and laughing]

286
00:13:26,797 --> 00:13:28,716
Boy: How about
that chick, huh?

287
00:13:28,717 --> 00:13:30,157
Go on.

288
00:13:30,158 --> 00:13:31,597
Hey, Danny,
you're blushing.

289
00:13:32,557 --> 00:13:34,477
[Bell rings]

290
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,763
Man: Just
a second, Danny.

291
00:13:36,764 --> 00:13:38,205
Go ahead,
Mrs. Pearson.

292
00:13:38,605 --> 00:13:40,076
Arriving late
the last day of school,

293
00:13:40,557 --> 00:13:42,476
your mouth all smeared
with lipstick.

294
00:13:42,477 --> 00:13:44,397
How do you explain that,
Mr. Fisher?

295
00:13:44,605 --> 00:13:47,755
Well, I don't know as I can
explain it, Mrs. Pearson.

296
00:13:47,756 --> 00:13:50,635
You see, sir,
this morning I--i went in--

297
00:13:50,636 --> 00:13:52,555
I usually go in
to sweep up, see?

298
00:13:52,556 --> 00:13:54,475
But, uh, uh--

299
00:13:54,476 --> 00:13:55,916
Well--well,
look, honey, I mean--

300
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:57,355
Mr. Fisher.

301
00:13:57,356 --> 00:13:59,756
I have been instructing
here for some 20 years,

302
00:13:59,757 --> 00:14:01,676
and no one ever
called me honey.

303
00:14:01,677 --> 00:14:03,597
Oh, I believe you.

304
00:14:03,757 --> 00:14:05,996
Mrs. Pearson,
let me talk to the boy.

305
00:14:06,204 --> 00:14:06,956
If you'll
forgive me, sir,

306
00:14:06,957 --> 00:14:09,356
I have talked to
the boy many times,

307
00:14:09,357 --> 00:14:10,795
and to what avail?

308
00:14:10,796 --> 00:14:12,236
On his last day
of school,

309
00:14:12,237 --> 00:14:14,156
in an unprovoked
display of violence,

310
00:14:14,157 --> 00:14:15,595
he attacked
two of his classmates.

311
00:14:15,596 --> 00:14:17,515
The boy has
no conception

312
00:14:17,516 --> 00:14:19,435
of respect
and discipline.

313
00:14:19,436 --> 00:14:20,876
Under
the circumstances,

314
00:14:20,877 --> 00:14:22,316
regretfully, perhaps,

315
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:24,235
I have no choice.

316
00:14:24,236 --> 00:14:28,076
Mr. Fisher will not
be graduating tomorrow.

317
00:14:32,396 --> 00:14:34,315
Danny, wait a minute.

318
00:14:34,316 --> 00:14:36,716
I'd like to talk to you.

319
00:14:37,196 --> 00:14:39,596
You know I'll have to go
along with her, don't you?

320
00:14:40,076 --> 00:14:41,515
I just want you
to know that I'm sorry.

321
00:14:41,516 --> 00:14:42,955
Well, thanks.

322
00:14:42,956 --> 00:14:43,916
Well, I'll be seeing
you next year.

323
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:45,836
No, you won't
see me next year.

324
00:14:46,316 --> 00:14:47,276
Now, wait a minute.

325
00:14:47,756 --> 00:14:49,196
Sit down, Danny.

326
00:14:50,636 --> 00:14:52,076
Sit down, I said.

327
00:14:53,036 --> 00:14:54,475
Now, you've just
been told

328
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,395
that you're not
graduating tomorrow.

329
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,835
Doesn't that mean
anything to you?

330
00:14:57,836 --> 00:15:00,235
You said I'm not graduating.
Okay, that's it.

331
00:15:00,236 --> 00:15:01,644
Now what do you want?

332
00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:03,595
I once had a son, Danny.

333
00:15:03,596 --> 00:15:05,035
He lived 13 years.

334
00:15:05,036 --> 00:15:07,436
Some hoodlums jumped him
one night, and he died.

335
00:15:07,564 --> 00:15:09,355
I'm sorry, but what's
that got to do with me?

336
00:15:09,356 --> 00:15:11,275
Because you have all the
earmarks of being a hoodlum.

337
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:12,715
A hoodlum or a hustler.

338
00:15:12,716 --> 00:15:14,155
Whatever you
want to call it.

339
00:15:14,156 --> 00:15:15,595
This isn't
principal talk.

340
00:15:15,596 --> 00:15:17,035
Well, the more difficult
the student,

341
00:15:17,036 --> 00:15:19,435
the more I try
to lean over backwards.

342
00:15:19,436 --> 00:15:20,875
Listen, Mr. Evans,

343
00:15:20,876 --> 00:15:23,755
we moved into this
neighborhood 3 years ago.

344
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,676
In the 3 years that I've
been going to school here,

345
00:15:26,156 --> 00:15:29,035
I've shined shoes and dusted
people off in a barbershop.

346
00:15:29,036 --> 00:15:31,915
I've done towel duty
in four different men's rooms.

347
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,315
I've stacked chairs and bottles
and swept the floor up

348
00:15:34,316 --> 00:15:35,756
of every joint
on bourbon street.

349
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:38,156
It's gotten so I look longer

350
00:15:38,636 --> 00:15:41,035
at a dame with clothes on
than one without.

351
00:15:41,036 --> 00:15:42,475
I'm not a hoodlum,

352
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:44,395
but I am a hustler.

353
00:15:44,396 --> 00:15:46,795
I've had to be for
a very simple reason--

354
00:15:46,796 --> 00:15:49,675
My old man.

355
00:15:49,676 --> 00:15:52,555
You see, sir, my mother
was killed in an accident

356
00:15:52,556 --> 00:15:53,995
about three years ago.

357
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:55,435
Well, after that,

358
00:15:55,436 --> 00:15:57,355
it might as well have
gotten the old man, too,

359
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,755
because he took himself
right out of the lineup.

360
00:15:59,756 --> 00:16:01,195
He quit cold.

361
00:16:01,196 --> 00:16:03,595
He lost
the drugstore he owned,

362
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:05,035
he lost the house,

363
00:16:05,036 --> 00:16:07,916
and then finally what few
little jobs he's had since.

364
00:16:09,356 --> 00:16:12,236
You know, maybe I could have
liked school, Mr. Evans,

365
00:16:12,716 --> 00:16:14,156
but every time
I wanted to play ball,

366
00:16:14,636 --> 00:16:16,075
I had to go to work.

367
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:17,995
Somebody had to.

368
00:16:17,996 --> 00:16:19,436
Anyway, now I'm through.
I'm through.

369
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,795
I wasn't aware that you
worked after school, Danny.

370
00:16:22,796 --> 00:16:25,195
It's not the working
after school, Mr. Evans.

371
00:16:25,196 --> 00:16:27,115
It's the working before.

372
00:16:27,116 --> 00:16:29,036
It's been nice
talking to you.

373
00:16:29,437 --> 00:16:32,395
I'm sorry I said
what I did, Danny.

374
00:16:32,396 --> 00:16:33,356
That's all right.

375
00:16:33,836 --> 00:16:36,235
My life's a long way
from over yet,

376
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:39,116
and you never know.
You may be right.

377
00:16:45,356 --> 00:16:46,796
That's him.

378
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:48,716
Excuse me.

379
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:50,156
You Danny Fisher?

380
00:16:51,596 --> 00:16:53,035
What about it?

381
00:16:53,036 --> 00:16:54,476
Let's take a walk.

382
00:17:11,756 --> 00:17:13,675
Okay, what's the beef?

383
00:17:13,676 --> 00:17:15,116
They call me shark.

384
00:17:15,596 --> 00:17:16,556
This is sal,
and that's dummy.

385
00:17:16,556 --> 00:17:17,516
I--

386
00:17:17,516 --> 00:17:18,476
All right.

387
00:17:18,477 --> 00:17:21,355
Now, you beat up my brother
in school today,

388
00:17:21,356 --> 00:17:24,236
and I believe
in an eye for an eye.

389
00:17:27,116 --> 00:17:28,076
Okay, okay!

390
00:17:28,077 --> 00:17:31,436
You go for the knife,
I'll bash his brains in.

391
00:17:38,156 --> 00:17:40,556
Well, you go
real fast.

392
00:17:41,036 --> 00:17:41,996
All right.

393
00:17:43,436 --> 00:17:46,796
You--you're right
about my brother.

394
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:50,155
He should learn
a little manners.

395
00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:53,515
So would you like to
hang out with us, huh?

396
00:17:53,516 --> 00:17:54,476
No.

397
00:17:54,925 --> 00:17:55,916
Why not?
Wait a minute.

398
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:57,355
Wait.
We get money.

399
00:17:57,356 --> 00:17:59,756
Sometimes
we get a lot.

400
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,156
Listen, we got something
cooking for us tomorrow.

401
00:18:02,636 --> 00:18:05,516
If you change your mind,
we'll be right here.

402
00:18:06,956 --> 00:18:07,916
I said no.

403
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:09,356
[Kicks knife]

404
00:18:11,276 --> 00:18:12,236
Thanks.

405
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,356
Good boy.

406
00:18:22,796 --> 00:18:24,236
Fights real dirty.

407
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,555
Hi.

408
00:18:28,556 --> 00:18:30,476
Well?

409
00:18:33,836 --> 00:18:35,275
What's the matter?

410
00:18:35,276 --> 00:18:37,195
Old lady Pearson
flunked me, Mimi.

411
00:18:37,196 --> 00:18:39,115
I'm not graduating
tomorrow.

412
00:18:39,116 --> 00:18:40,076
Oh, Danny, no.

413
00:18:40,556 --> 00:18:41,996
Oh, Danny, yes.

414
00:18:42,476 --> 00:18:44,876
For the second year
in a row, yes.

415
00:18:45,356 --> 00:18:47,755
If this keeps up much longer,
I'll be a freshman again.

416
00:18:47,756 --> 00:18:51,115
But you could go
back another year.

417
00:18:51,116 --> 00:18:53,995
Yeah? You don't make
money in school, Mimi.

418
00:18:53,996 --> 00:18:56,396
Pop's been fired four times
in the last year,

419
00:18:56,876 --> 00:18:58,315
and he hasn't
got a job now.

420
00:18:58,316 --> 00:18:59,755
You're working,
I'm working,

421
00:18:59,756 --> 00:19:02,156
and from now on,
full-time, kid.

422
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,476
Well, guess
where I've been.

423
00:19:06,956 --> 00:19:08,876
Got a quart
of ice cream here

424
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,795
and this to go with it.

425
00:19:10,796 --> 00:19:12,715
A little special dessert
for the celebration.

426
00:19:12,716 --> 00:19:14,155
Papa, I want
to talk to you.

427
00:19:14,156 --> 00:19:16,076
Good, good, son.
I want to talk to you, too.

428
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:18,475
Mimi, you're gonna have to do
your listening from the kitchen.

429
00:19:18,476 --> 00:19:19,915
Go on now.

430
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,315
Well, let's see now, son.
Where do I begin?

431
00:19:22,316 --> 00:19:23,276
There's something
I have to tell you, pop,

432
00:19:23,276 --> 00:19:24,236
but you gotta
understand--

433
00:19:24,716 --> 00:19:26,636
Now, now, I don't
gotta nothing, huh?

434
00:19:27,116 --> 00:19:29,035
You gotta, 'cause
I'm older than you.

435
00:19:29,036 --> 00:19:30,955
I go first.

436
00:19:30,956 --> 00:19:33,356
Now, Danny, I made
some notes last year

437
00:19:33,836 --> 00:19:36,235
when you were
supposed to graduate,

438
00:19:36,236 --> 00:19:38,635
and I think I still
have them here.

439
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,556
Yeah, here they are.

440
00:19:41,036 --> 00:19:41,996
That's kind of silly,
isn't it?

441
00:19:41,997 --> 00:19:43,915
A father making notes
on things

442
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:44,876
that he wants to say
to his own son.

443
00:19:45,356 --> 00:19:46,316
Aw, pop--

444
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:49,195
Oh, I can--i can really
say it all in one breath.

445
00:19:49,196 --> 00:19:50,636
I'm proud of you, son.

446
00:19:51,116 --> 00:19:52,555
I'm proud of you because
you went back to school.

447
00:19:52,556 --> 00:19:53,995
Pa, there's something
you don't understand.

448
00:19:53,996 --> 00:19:54,956
Don't say it.
Don't even say it.

449
00:19:54,956 --> 00:19:55,916
I know all about it.

450
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:57,836
Now, Mr. Evans called me
this morning.

451
00:19:58,316 --> 00:19:59,755
I spent all afternoon
with him.

452
00:19:59,756 --> 00:20:01,676
We had a nice
long chat together.

453
00:20:02,156 --> 00:20:02,636
I'm sorry, pop.

454
00:20:03,116 --> 00:20:04,076
Well, I'm sorry,
too, son,

455
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,475
but things are gonna
be different, definitely.

456
00:20:06,476 --> 00:20:08,395
That's why
we're celebrating.

457
00:20:08,396 --> 00:20:12,716
We also had a talk
with that Mrs. Pearson woman.

458
00:20:13,196 --> 00:20:15,595
Now, she said that you could
graduate before next year

459
00:20:15,596 --> 00:20:18,475
if you'd go to night school
and make up your marks

460
00:20:18,476 --> 00:20:19,436
and learned
a little discipline.

461
00:20:19,436 --> 00:20:20,396
No--

462
00:20:20,876 --> 00:20:23,275
So from now on, Danny,
that's the way it's gonna be.

463
00:20:23,276 --> 00:20:24,715
No more working for you.

464
00:20:24,716 --> 00:20:26,155
You'll do
the going to school.

465
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:27,116
I'll do the going to work.

466
00:20:27,596 --> 00:20:29,035
How many times have we
been through this?

467
00:20:29,036 --> 00:20:30,476
Danny, you've got
to graduate.

468
00:20:30,956 --> 00:20:31,916
You've got to graduate

469
00:20:31,917 --> 00:20:33,355
if you ever want
to take up a profession.

470
00:20:33,356 --> 00:20:34,795
Pa, we've been
all through this.

471
00:20:34,796 --> 00:20:36,235
And I want you
to have a profession.

472
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:38,635
I don't want you working
on bourbon street

473
00:20:38,636 --> 00:20:40,555
with hoodlums and bums
the rest of your life.

474
00:20:40,556 --> 00:20:42,955
No. A profession
sets a man apart

475
00:20:42,956 --> 00:20:44,124
from the rest
of the world.

476
00:20:44,396 --> 00:20:45,356
Like you?

477
00:20:45,357 --> 00:20:47,276
A registered pharmacist,
and you can't get a job.

478
00:20:47,596 --> 00:20:49,195
You're wrong
about that, Danny.

479
00:20:49,196 --> 00:20:51,596
There was an opening came up
at the regal pharmacy,

480
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:53,516
and the employment office
is sending me over

481
00:20:53,996 --> 00:20:55,404
to see the manager.

482
00:20:55,484 --> 00:20:56,396
Well, that doesn't mean
you've got the job.

483
00:20:56,396 --> 00:20:57,356
Oh, they'll hire me.

484
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:58,316
Sure, they will.

485
00:20:58,317 --> 00:21:00,235
They'll hire me,
and I'll keep the job.

486
00:21:00,236 --> 00:21:01,675
Things are gonna be
different.

487
00:21:01,676 --> 00:21:04,076
I'm not going
back to school.

488
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:05,996
Look, son,

489
00:21:06,476 --> 00:21:08,395
you didn't fail because
your marks were bad.

490
00:21:08,396 --> 00:21:11,275
Mr. Evans said you failed
because of your attitude.

491
00:21:11,276 --> 00:21:13,195
He said anybody
that disagreed with you

492
00:21:13,196 --> 00:21:14,156
got a punch in the mouth.

493
00:21:14,636 --> 00:21:16,556
Is that what I brought
you up to do, to fight?

494
00:21:17,036 --> 00:21:18,955
No, pa, that's not what
you brought me up to do,

495
00:21:18,956 --> 00:21:20,876
but I stopped
listening to you.

496
00:21:21,356 --> 00:21:23,275
I ran out
of other cheeks.

497
00:21:23,276 --> 00:21:24,715
You know, I remember
once, pop,

498
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,155
when I was no more
than three feet high,

499
00:21:26,156 --> 00:21:27,596
you took me
to the circus.

500
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,515
You accidentally
bumped into some guy,

501
00:21:29,516 --> 00:21:30,956
and he turned around
and punched you.

502
00:21:31,436 --> 00:21:32,396
He punched you
right in the mouth,

503
00:21:32,397 --> 00:21:33,835
and you know
what you did?

504
00:21:33,836 --> 00:21:34,796
Nothing.

505
00:21:34,796 --> 00:21:35,756
Nothing.

506
00:21:35,757 --> 00:21:37,675
When they swing
at you, pop,

507
00:21:37,676 --> 00:21:39,115
it's not enough
to duck.

508
00:21:39,116 --> 00:21:40,556
You gotta
swing back.

509
00:21:40,876 --> 00:21:41,995
Maybe you can't
anymore,

510
00:21:41,996 --> 00:21:43,435
but I'm not
taking after you.

511
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:44,875
You go to school.

512
00:21:44,876 --> 00:21:46,156
I'm going out
and make a buck.

513
00:21:53,036 --> 00:21:54,955
Sal: Yeah, but we can't
count on him.

514
00:21:54,956 --> 00:21:55,916
What good is he, huh?

515
00:21:56,396 --> 00:21:57,356
Collecting money
or something.

516
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,795
That's about all
he can do.

517
00:21:58,796 --> 00:21:59,756
Hi.

518
00:21:59,757 --> 00:22:02,155
Well, well,
now we're somewhere.

519
00:22:02,156 --> 00:22:03,595
I was hoping
you'd show.

520
00:22:03,596 --> 00:22:05,035
You said something
about money.

521
00:22:05,036 --> 00:22:05,996
Funny you should
bring that up.

522
00:22:05,997 --> 00:22:08,395
That's just what
we were talking about.

523
00:22:08,396 --> 00:22:10,795
Do you know that five-and-dime
on Charles street?

524
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:12,235
Well, we were gonna pull
a phony fight there,

525
00:22:12,236 --> 00:22:14,635
but my brother,
he gave me a better idea.

526
00:22:14,636 --> 00:22:16,555
He told me that you sing
like a bird.

527
00:22:16,556 --> 00:22:17,996
In fact, he says that's
what you're famous for

528
00:22:18,476 --> 00:22:20,395
in that school of yours--
Singing and flunking.

You're not gonna
steal anything now.

about them.

I'm sorry.
That job has been filled.

620
00:26:14,635 --> 00:26:15,595
But the employment
office told me that--

621
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:17,036
I hired a man yesterday.

622

But I've got to
have the job.

00:26:18,956 --> 00:26:20,395

Oh, no trouble
at all, Mr. furst.

about a job.

younger than me.

We've had four younger men
in the last three months.

634

Have you read
this man's credentials?

635
00:26:38,635 --> 00:26:40,554
Is he a good man
or an incompetent man?

636
00:26:40,555 --> 00:26:42,955
How do you tell that,
by looking at his suit?

637
00:26:42,956 --> 00:26:44,394
I'll wait over here.

638
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:45,836
Give the man
an application.

639
00:26:46,315 --> 00:26:47,275
I don't have
any applications.

640
00:26:47,276 --> 00:26:49,195
Then give him the job.

881
00:36:01,241 --> 00:36:02,201
Okay.
Okay.

882
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:07,000
What can I do
for you, sir?

883
00:36:07,001 --> 00:36:08,440
Oh, what room's
the party in?

884
00:36:08,441 --> 00:36:09,880
I beg your pardon--
What party?

885
00:36:09,881 --> 00:36:12,280
You know, the party
the fellas are having.

886
00:36:12,281 --> 00:36:16,601
Oh. Oh! It's up in 205.

887
00:36:26,201 --> 00:36:28,600
Well, it looks like
my friends are late.

888
00:36:28,601 --> 00:36:30,521
Or maybe
we're early, huh?

889
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:33,881
What kind of a game
are you playing?

890
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:35,800
It's no game.

891
00:36:35,801 --> 00:36:37,240
Honest.

892
00:36:37,241 --> 00:36:39,161
I like you.

893
00:36:39,641 --> 00:36:41,080
What's your name?

894
00:36:41,081 --> 00:36:44,440
Nellie. I told you
in the store.

895
00:36:44,441 --> 00:36:45,881
Oh, yeah. Nellie.

896
00:36:46,841 --> 00:36:49,240
I--i like you, Nellie.

897
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:50,681
I like you a lot.

898
00:36:51,161 --> 00:36:53,080
What's your name?

899
00:36:53,081 --> 00:36:54,041
George.

900
00:36:55,961 --> 00:36:58,361
How much did
this room cost you?

901
00:37:01,721 --> 00:37:03,161
My name's Danny.

902
00:37:03,641 --> 00:37:05,560
Danny Fisher.

903
00:37:05,561 --> 00:37:07,001
You comin' in?

904
00:37:09,401 --> 00:37:10,361
I don't know.

905
00:37:11,801 --> 00:37:15,161
I've never been to a place
like this before.

906
00:37:15,641 --> 00:37:18,040
But I want
to see you again.

907
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:19,481
Is this the way?

908
00:37:21,881 --> 00:37:24,280
I've been looking
at the door

909
00:37:24,281 --> 00:37:27,160
of that lousy
five-and-ten for a year.

910
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:30,521
And today when you
walked in, I thought...

911
00:37:31,961 --> 00:37:32,921
Oh!

912
00:37:32,922 --> 00:37:35,321
Well, what are you
bawling about?

913
00:37:35,801 --> 00:37:37,241
Stop bawling.

914
00:37:39,161 --> 00:37:41,080
I like you.

915
00:37:41,081 --> 00:37:43,960
That's the reason
I'm crying.

916
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:47,320
I--i like you more than
I like anybody I know.

917
00:37:47,321 --> 00:37:49,241
And I don't even know you.

918
00:37:49,513 --> 00:37:53,081
That's why--
That's why I'm crying.

919
00:37:57,401 --> 00:37:59,320
[Closes door]

920
00:37:59,321 --> 00:38:01,721
The party's over.
Let's go.

921
00:38:10,841 --> 00:38:13,720
Well,
I guess this is it.

922
00:38:13,721 --> 00:38:15,641
Good night, Danny.

923
00:38:16,121 --> 00:38:18,040
I guess I'd better
go upstairs now.

924
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:19,001
Good night.

925
00:38:33,881 --> 00:38:36,281
I didn't mean nothing
by it, honest.

926
00:38:36,761 --> 00:38:37,721
But you played up to me
this afternoon.

927
00:38:37,722 --> 00:38:40,601
I--i thought
you knew the score.

928
00:38:41,081 --> 00:38:42,041
I'm sorry.

929
00:38:42,233 --> 00:38:43,961
I liked you right away,
that's all.

930
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:48,281
I better go now.

931
00:38:49,721 --> 00:38:52,121
Will--will I see you
again, Danny?

932
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,561
Well, I--i don't know.

933
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,480
You see...

934
00:38:55,481 --> 00:38:56,921
I'm pretty busy.

935
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,321
I don't know.

936
00:39:00,761 --> 00:39:04,121
If you ever had the time,
I'd--I'd like to see you again.

937
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:07,001
Good night.

938
00:39:08,921 --> 00:39:09,881
Good night.

939
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:23,801
Hey, schoolboy.

940
00:39:28,601 --> 00:39:31,480
I thought this was gonna be
turned into a pumpkin.

941
00:39:31,481 --> 00:39:33,400
You really showed Maxie.

942
00:39:33,401 --> 00:39:34,361
You can sing.

943
00:39:34,362 --> 00:39:35,800
So do you, I hear.

944
00:39:35,801 --> 00:39:36,761
I used to.

945
00:39:37,113 --> 00:39:39,640
Yeah, I met a guy named,
uh...Legrand.

946
00:39:39,641 --> 00:39:40,601
Charlie?

947
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:41,561
Yeah.

948
00:39:41,561 --> 00:39:42,521
He's a nice fellow.

949
00:39:42,522 --> 00:39:43,960
Smart, too.

950
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:45,400
He sounded broke to me.

951
00:39:45,401 --> 00:39:46,361
He is.

952
00:39:46,362 --> 00:39:47,800
Now, how smart
do you call that?

953
00:39:47,801 --> 00:39:49,720
He owns the king creole.

954
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:52,120
It's the only place
on bourbon street

955
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:54,040
without Maxie Fields'
fingerprints

956
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:55,001
on the cash register.

957
00:39:55,002 --> 00:39:56,921
I'd say that's smart.

958
00:39:57,401 --> 00:40:00,760
Uh, that's, uh...That's
a pretty piece of material.

959
00:40:00,761 --> 00:40:02,681
You ought to have a dress
made out of it.

960
00:40:02,952 --> 00:40:05,081
Don't you like it?

961
00:40:05,353 --> 00:40:06,521
I love it.

962
00:40:07,961 --> 00:40:10,840
Hey, what do you say we
get together sometime

963
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:13,240
and sing all the old songs

964
00:40:13,241 --> 00:40:14,680
or--or anything else
you want to do?

965
00:40:14,681 --> 00:40:16,600
I'd like to.
I--i can't.

966
00:40:16,601 --> 00:40:19,001
I'd really like to,
but I can't.

967
00:40:19,961 --> 00:40:20,921
I get it.

968
00:40:21,353 --> 00:40:23,320
Maybe we'll meet
someplace by accident.

969
00:40:23,593 --> 00:40:25,720
Well, you tell me
where you think

970
00:40:25,721 --> 00:40:27,159
the accident
will take place,

971
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,552
and I'll make sure
I'm there.

972
00:40:28,633 --> 00:40:29,561
It'll take place.

973
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,000
Just don't rush it.

974
00:40:31,481 --> 00:40:33,400
I'll be waiting.

975
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:34,839
You'd better go now.

976
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,280
What's the big rush?

977
00:40:36,281 --> 00:40:38,680
Maxie'll be here any
minute. You'd better go.

978
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,479
You remember in the cab
when you wouldn't leave

979
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,399
until I kissed you?

980
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,233
Well, I'm standing right
here until you kiss me.

981
00:40:57,401 --> 00:41:00,280
I'll see you sometime.

982
00:41:00,281 --> 00:41:02,680
Boy, that's gonna be
some accident.

Mr. primont, off and on
for over 25 years,

993
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:47,158
I've been doing
the same kind of work,

994
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:48,598
and I've filled a lot
of prescriptions

995
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:49,559
just like this one.

996
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,998
Now--now,
in my opinion--

997
00:41:50,999 --> 00:41:52,438
I don't care how long

998
00:41:52,439 --> 00:41:53,878
you've been filling
out prescriptions.

999
00:41:53,879 --> 00:41:55,798
What I'm telling you is
that I'm running the store.

1000
00:41:55,799 --> 00:41:57,238
Why, of course, sir.

1001
00:41:57,239 --> 00:41:58,678
But see, all I'm saying
is that in my opinion,

1002
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:00,118
the mixture
that you're using--

1003
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:01,558
Finnell, will you shut
your old mouth up?

1004
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:02,519
Just shut your old mouth up

1005
00:42:02,999 --> 00:42:03,959
and do things the way
I say or get out.

1006
00:42:03,959 --> 00:42:04,919
Why, yes, of course.

1007
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,358
Now take that jar
and put it back

1008
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:07,799
on the counter
where it belongs.

1009
00:42:08,279 --> 00:42:10,198
Yes, Mr. primont.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1010
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:11,159
Danny.

1011
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,598
Hey, pop.

1012
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:15,478
Danny, what--what
a pleasant surprise.

1013
00:42:15,479 --> 00:42:16,918
You been here long?

1014
00:42:16,919 --> 00:42:18,358
No. I--i just walked in.

1015
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:19,319
I wanted to wish you
luck on your first day.

1016
00:42:19,799 --> 00:42:20,759
Well, thank you.

1017
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:23,158
Would you like to sit down
for a few minutes?

1018
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:24,119
No. There was something

1019
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:25,079
I wanted to talk
to you about, pop,

1020
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:26,519
but, you know,
you were up and gone

1021
00:42:26,999 --> 00:42:27,959
before I even turned
over this morning.

1022
00:42:28,439 --> 00:42:30,359
Uh-huh. This job I keep.

1023
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:31,799
Well, we'll talk
about it tonight, pop.

1024
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:32,759
Anything wrong here?

1025
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:33,719
Uh--

1026
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:35,638
Uh, yes. There's
plenty wrong here.

1027
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:37,558
I had a prescription
filled here last week,

1028
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:39,478
and I got
the wrong medicine.

1029
00:42:39,479 --> 00:42:40,439
It almost poisoned me.

1030
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,358
Oh, that pharmacist
is no longer with us.

1031
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:44,278
So I was just told.
Lucky for you

1032
00:42:44,279 --> 00:42:46,198
this gentleman knows what
he's talking about.

1033
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:48,598
Thanks to you, sir,
I'll be coming back in.

1034
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:49,559
Good day, sir.

1035
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,478
Uh, good day, sir.
Call again.

1036
00:42:51,479 --> 00:42:52,919
I will.

1037
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:23,638
Well, hello.

1038
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:25,078
Hi.

1039
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:27,479
I figured you'd decided
to stay with Maxie.

1040
00:43:27,959 --> 00:43:28,919
No, but...

1041
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:31,318
Well, I don't know what
to do, Mr. Legrand.

1042
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:32,759
You see, my old man's
against all of this.

1043
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:34,199
He wants me to
go back to school.

1044
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:37,078
Oh? Sit down.

1045
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:39,479
What does he
want you to be?

1046
00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:43,318
Well, he used to talk about
me becoming president,

1047
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:47,638
but, uh, I think he
gave up on that idea.

1048
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:50,039
How much does
a singing job pay?

1049
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:52,918
Here you start at scale--
85 a week.

1050
00:43:52,919 --> 00:43:54,839
If they like you,
you get more.

1051
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:56,758
How does it sound?

1052
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:59,638
Well, it sounds good,
but, uh...

1053
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:02,038
Well, I--i never sang
professionally before.

1054
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:02,999
I don't even know
if I can do it.

1055
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,710
Well,
you did it last night.

1056
00:44:04,711 --> 00:44:06,838
Yeah, but last night,
I was mad.

1057
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:07,799
Oh, so stay mad.

1058
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:09,239
You've sold me.

1059
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:10,679
Now if I could just
sell my old man.

1060
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:14,039
Well, if you do as he
says and go to school,

1061
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:15,958
what about after school?

1062
00:44:15,959 --> 00:44:17,878
No deal.

1063
00:44:17,879 --> 00:44:20,759
He says I do the studying,
he does the work.

1064
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:25,078
Only, I saw him
do the work.

1065
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,478
You hate to see someone
crawl, Mr. Legrand,

1066
00:44:27,479 --> 00:44:30,358
especially if it's
your own father.

1067
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:32,758
Now, I pushed him
into that job,

1068
00:44:32,759 --> 00:44:34,678
but $85 a week
could get him out.

1069
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:36,119
Let me talk to him.

1070
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:37,079
It won't do you no good.

1071
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:38,519
I've known him
since I was born.

1072
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,958
Invite me to dinner.

1073
00:44:39,959 --> 00:44:40,919
You're wasting
your time.

1074
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,359
Why? It's a free meal.

1075
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:43,799
You afraid of him?

1076
00:44:44,071 --> 00:44:45,238
No.

1077
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:47,158
Then invite me.

1078
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:48,119
Okay, you're invited.

1079
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,558
29 royal street,
all the way up.

1080
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:51,479
29 royal.

1081
00:44:52,678 --> 00:44:55,318
Ronnie says
you're smart.

1082
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:57,238
Does she?

1083
00:44:57,239 --> 00:44:59,159
She ought to know.

1084
00:44:59,319 --> 00:45:01,078
She could have
had a career.

1085
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:02,998
Not that she
hasn't got one.

1086
00:45:02,999 --> 00:45:05,399
Maxie Fields--
There's a name for you.

1087
00:45:05,879 --> 00:45:07,799
Everything he touches
turns to drink.

1088
00:45:08,071 --> 00:45:09,239
You know him all right.

1089
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:10,631
Know him?

1090
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:12,599
Maxie and I
go a long way back.

1091
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:14,519
We were kids together.

1092
00:45:14,999 --> 00:45:17,398
I remember the first words
that came out of his mouth--

1093
00:45:17,399 --> 00:45:18,359
"stick 'em up."

1094
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:19,799
See you at dinner.

1095
00:45:19,799 --> 00:45:20,759
Okay.

1096
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:26,038
No, you don't understand
how I feel, Mr. Legrand,

1097
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:28,438
and you won't watch out for him
like he's your own son,

1098
00:45:28,439 --> 00:45:30,359
because he's not your son.
He's my son.

1099
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:32,278
Just a minute,
Mr. Fisher.

1100
00:45:32,279 --> 00:45:34,679
You keep speaking of Danny
having a profession.

1101
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:36,119
Singing is a profession.

1102
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:38,519
All right, so he's
starting in a sewer.

1103
00:45:38,999 --> 00:45:39,959
Sewers can't be ignored.

1104
00:45:40,439 --> 00:45:42,358
They run under
the best cities,

1105
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:44,279
and some of them lead to the
fanciest plumbing at the ritz.

1106
00:45:44,759 --> 00:45:45,719
But Danny
isn't a plumber.

1107
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,158
What I meant--

1108
00:45:47,159 --> 00:45:48,598
I know what you meant.

1109
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:51,958
The answer is no.
I'm sorry, Mr. Legrand.

1110
00:45:51,959 --> 00:45:53,878
No, you're not sorry.

1111
00:45:53,879 --> 00:45:56,278
Why don't you ask him
what he wants to do?

1112
00:45:56,279 --> 00:45:58,678
The boy was born
with an unusual talent.

1113
00:45:58,679 --> 00:46:00,118
He has the right
to think for himself.

1114
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:02,999
You don't have a right
to ask me these questions.

1115
00:46:03,479 --> 00:46:06,358
Mimi, will you please
get Mr. Legrand's hat?

1116
00:46:06,359 --> 00:46:07,799
All right, pop.

1117
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:11,158
Thanks for dinner, Mimi.

1118
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:12,119
You're some cook.

1119
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:13,079
Thanks.

1120
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:15,478
I may be leaving
empty-handed,

1121
00:46:15,479 --> 00:46:17,398
but everywhere else
I'm full.

1122
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:18,838
I'm going out
for a while, pa.

1123
00:46:18,839 --> 00:46:20,278
I'll be back.

1124
00:46:20,279 --> 00:46:23,158
I'd like to speak
to you again about this.

1125
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:25,558
Maybe we can have a drink
and talk it over quietly.

1126
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:26,519
I don't drink.

1127
00:46:27,959 --> 00:46:31,318
No, I didn't
think you did.

1128
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:32,759
Good-bye, Danny.

1129
00:46:41,399 --> 00:46:43,318
Why'd you bring
a man like that here?

1130
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:45,719
Pa, you didn't have
to talk to him like that.

1131
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:48,598
He thinks I can
do a job for him.

1132
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:50,039
But you don't care what
he thinks or what I think

1133
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:51,958
or what I want,
for that matter.

1134
00:46:51,959 --> 00:46:52,919
What do you want, son?

1135
00:46:53,399 --> 00:46:54,359
A pink convertible.

1136
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,278
Then register at school.

1137
00:46:56,279 --> 00:46:59,638
Look, pa, I got
a very average brain.

1138
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:00,599
I'm not
a brilliant student.

1139
00:47:01,078 --> 00:47:02,518
I'm average.
Do you understand?

1140
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:03,957
I don't want to crawl.

1141
00:47:03,958 --> 00:47:05,877
Oh, I crawl, is that it?
Is that what I do?

1142
00:47:05,878 --> 00:47:07,318
Yeah, you crawl.
You have no choice.

1143
00:47:07,319 --> 00:47:08,757
They got you
on the run early.

1144
00:47:08,758 --> 00:47:10,677
That's not so!
That's not the truth!

1145
00:47:10,678 --> 00:47:11,638
I've fought--

1146
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:13,558
You fought!
Sure, you fought!

1147
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,478
You back-pedaled
all the way.

1148
00:47:15,959 --> 00:47:18,357
I saw what happened today
between you and your boss, pa,

1149
00:47:18,358 --> 00:47:19,798
and it's not going
to happen to me.

1150
00:47:19,799 --> 00:47:21,718
Charlie Legrand's
got 85 bucks a week

1151
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:23,157
that says
I can be a performer.

1152
00:47:23,158 --> 00:47:25,077
If he's willing to take
a chance, then so am i.

1153
00:47:25,078 --> 00:47:26,038
What about school?

1154
00:47:26,038 --> 00:47:26,998
I went to school.

1155
00:47:26,998 --> 00:47:27,958
And you failed.

1156
00:47:27,958 --> 00:47:28,918
I'm through failing.

1157
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:36,597
You know, if you
weren't so young,

1158
00:47:36,598 --> 00:47:38,038
I'd ask you to have
that drink with me.

1159
00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:39,959
I think I'm old enough
to have a drink, Mr. Legrand.

1160
00:47:40,438 --> 00:47:41,398
Swell. Let's go.

1161
00:47:41,399 --> 00:47:42,838
No, not tonight.

1162
00:47:42,839 --> 00:47:44,758
I think it would
look kind of funny.

1163
00:47:44,759 --> 00:47:46,678
Tomorrow night?

1164
00:47:46,679 --> 00:47:48,117
I'll pick you up
at 9:00.

1165
00:47:48,118 --> 00:47:50,518
All right,
it's a date.

1166
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:51,957
You know,
I was wondering.

1167
00:47:51,958 --> 00:47:53,398
Is there anything
in particular

1168
00:47:53,399 --> 00:47:55,798
a man of 40 says
to a girl of 20?

1169
00:47:56,279 --> 00:47:58,198
Mm-hmm.

1170
00:47:58,199 --> 00:48:00,597
Say you're 38.

1171
00:48:00,598 --> 00:48:02,517
Yeah.
[Chuckles]

1172
00:48:02,518 --> 00:48:03,478
Danny.

1173
00:48:04,919 --> 00:48:06,357
I'm sorry,
Mr. Legrand.

1174
00:48:06,358 --> 00:48:07,799
I knew it was
gonna happen.

1175
00:48:08,278 --> 00:48:09,238
That's all right.
You don't mind

1176
00:48:09,239 --> 00:48:11,158
if I have a drink with
your sister, do you?

1177
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:12,599
Well, you know
I don't care,

1178
00:48:13,078 --> 00:48:14,518
but you'd better check
with the old man.

1179
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:16,438
Mr. Legrand isn't going to make
a singer out of me, so why--

1180
00:48:16,439 --> 00:48:18,837
No, but he's going
to make one out of me.

1181
00:48:18,838 --> 00:48:20,757
Do we sign papers or
shake hands or what?

1182
00:48:20,758 --> 00:48:22,198
We shake hands.

1183
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,597
After you open
and you're a smash,

1184
00:48:24,598 --> 00:48:25,558
then we sign papers.

1185
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:26,999
I'll be at the club
tomorrow morning.

1186
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,918
Good.

00:50:43,734 --> 00:50:45,173
Here we go. You'll
be great tonight.

1228
00:50:45,174 --> 00:50:47,093
I heard you
rehearsing before.

1229
00:50:47,094 --> 00:50:49,013
What kind of songs are
you singing, folk songs?

1230
00:50:49,014 --> 00:50:50,453
Yeah, I guess so.

1231
00:50:50,454 --> 00:50:54,293
That's what I thought.
What planet?

1232
00:50:54,294 --> 00:50:56,694
Just laughing it up,
kid.

1233
00:50:56,885 --> 00:50:58,133
No offense. Ha ha!

1234
00:50:58,134 --> 00:50:59,094
Ha ha.

1235
00:51:01,446 --> 00:51:01,974
Nervous?

1236
00:51:02,454 --> 00:51:03,414
A little.

1237
00:51:03,415 --> 00:51:06,294
I just wanted you to know
the place isn't full.

1238
00:51:06,406 --> 00:51:08,693
But half a house can hate
you as hard as a full house.

1239
00:51:08,694 --> 00:51:09,654
Right.

1240
00:51:09,654 --> 00:51:10,614
When you walk
out there tonight,

1241
00:51:10,615 --> 00:51:12,053
as far as you're concerned,
the place is jammed.

1242
00:51:12,054 --> 00:51:13,493
They're expecting the best,

1243
00:51:13,494 --> 00:51:14,454
and that's what you've
got to give them.

1244
00:51:14,934 --> 00:51:15,894
You know something?
I'm glad you told me this.

1245
00:51:15,894 --> 00:51:16,854
I'm not nervous anymore.

1246
00:51:16,855 --> 00:51:18,294
Good.
I'm scared to death.

1247
00:51:18,774 --> 00:51:19,734
What for?
All you have to do

1248
00:51:19,735 --> 00:51:21,173
is sing like you're mad,
and you'll be a smash.

1249
00:51:21,174 --> 00:51:22,614
[Drumroll]
Here we go.

1250
00:51:23,094 --> 00:51:24,532
The 2 biggest words
in show business...

1251
00:51:24,533 --> 00:51:25,493
"You're on."

1252
00:51:32,213 --> 00:51:33,653
Now, ladies
and gentlemen...

1253
00:51:33,654 --> 00:51:35,573
The moment
you've all been waiting for.

1254
00:51:35,574 --> 00:51:37,972
The king creole takes
great pride in presenting

1255
00:51:37,973 --> 00:51:39,414
a young man
with a big future.

1256
00:51:39,525 --> 00:51:41,812
The new sensation
of bourbon street...

1257
00:51:41,813 --> 00:51:44,692

Hey, Danny.

1308
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:58,294
Hi.

1309
00:53:58,295 --> 00:54:00,213
You busy?
No.

1310
00:54:00,214 --> 00:54:01,174
Okay. We got a date?

1311
00:54:01,174 --> 00:54:02,134
Where are we going?

1312
00:54:02,134 --> 00:54:03,094
I'll show you.

[Riverboat whistle blows]

1314
00:54:08,853 --> 00:54:11,253
We're almost there.
It's just around this bend.

1315
00:54:11,254 --> 00:54:12,214
Wait till you see it.

1316
00:54:15,094 --> 00:54:18,452
You don't know how
I was hoping you'd come by.

1317
00:54:18,453 --> 00:54:20,373
I don't even understand it.

1318
00:54:20,854 --> 00:54:22,774
I mean, lots of fellas
have come into the store

1319
00:54:23,253 --> 00:54:24,213
asking for a date.

1320
00:54:24,214 --> 00:54:26,132
Just like you.

1321
00:54:26,133 --> 00:54:29,012
Making cracks.

1322
00:54:29,013 --> 00:54:32,852
You were even worse.
You came in to rob the store.

1323
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:36,213
But I was looking
for you when I came out.

1324
00:54:36,214 --> 00:54:39,572
Then you took me
to that hotel...

1325
00:54:39,573 --> 00:54:41,973
And I went with you.

1326
00:54:41,974 --> 00:54:43,894
I don't understand it.

1327
00:54:44,373 --> 00:54:45,333
I thought
I was a nice girl.

1328
00:54:45,685 --> 00:54:47,733
You are a nice girl,
Nellie.

1329
00:54:47,734 --> 00:54:50,613
I've been thinking about
that night, and I'm sorry.

1330
00:54:50,614 --> 00:54:52,533
Yeah, me, too.

1331
00:54:52,534 --> 00:54:53,972
I told you before--

1332
00:54:53,973 --> 00:54:57,812
No, Danny, that's not
what I'm sorry about.

1333
00:54:57,813 --> 00:55:00,693
It's like everything
just started with you.

1334
00:55:01,014 --> 00:55:04,532
I guess both of us
did something that day

1335
00:55:04,533 --> 00:55:05,973
we'd never done
before, Nellie.

1336
00:55:05,974 --> 00:55:09,333
I never robbed a store.

1337
00:55:09,814 --> 00:55:11,733
I guess there's a last time
for everything, too.

1338
00:55:11,734 --> 00:55:12,694
Danny, I--i
didn't mean it.

1339
00:55:12,695 --> 00:55:14,613
Wait. We're
coming to it now.

1340
00:55:14,614 --> 00:55:16,052
You see that house
over there?

1341
00:55:16,053 --> 00:55:18,932
Way over there?
See it?

1342
00:55:18,933 --> 00:55:21,812
That used
to be our house.

1343
00:55:21,813 --> 00:55:23,254
Pa bought it when
I was about 8 years old.

1344
00:55:23,733 --> 00:55:25,174
It was kind of
my birthday present.

1345
00:55:25,366 --> 00:55:28,533
We sure had a lot of
happy times there.

1346
00:55:28,646 --> 00:55:30,933
I'm gonna buy that
house back someday

1347
00:55:30,934 --> 00:55:32,372
or one just like it.

1348
00:55:32,373 --> 00:55:33,813
And I guarantee you,

1349
00:55:33,814 --> 00:55:34,774
nobody's gonna take
it away from me.

1350
00:55:34,775 --> 00:55:36,644
Nobody.

1351
00:55:36,645 --> 00:55:40,052
I told my mother
about you.

1352
00:55:40,053 --> 00:55:41,972
I told her I met
a million-dollar boyfriend

1353
00:55:41,973 --> 00:55:43,893
in a five-and-ten-cent store.

1354
00:55:47,254 --> 00:55:49,173
Danny...

1355
00:55:49,174 --> 00:55:51,573
Aren't you ever going
to kiss me tonight?

1356
00:55:53,493 --> 00:55:57,813
Nellie, don't fall
in love with me.

1357
00:55:57,814 --> 00:56:01,172
Love means getting
married, having kids.

1358
00:56:01,173 --> 00:56:02,614
I don't even know
who I am yet.

1359
00:56:02,773 --> 00:56:05,012
Who do you have to be?

1360
00:56:05,013 --> 00:56:06,454
I don't want to be
like my old man.

1361
00:56:08,853 --> 00:56:12,213
Love, marriage,
having kids.

1362
00:56:12,214 --> 00:56:14,134
I want to be
somebody first.

1363
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:16,054
Do you know
a better way?

1364
00:56:19,413 --> 00:56:21,333
You could still kiss me.

1365
00:56:29,973 --> 00:56:31,893
Just...Just leave it
at that, Nellie.

1366
00:56:32,374 --> 00:56:33,334
For now, anyway.

1367
00:56:33,335 --> 00:56:35,253

Hurry up! Your breakfast
is getting cold.

1420
00:59:02,134 --> 00:59:03,572
Okay, I'm coming.

1421
00:59:03,573 --> 00:59:05,492
Well, big shot.
Sing a couple of songs

1422
00:59:05,493 --> 00:59:06,933
and right away sleep
all morning, huh?

1423
00:59:06,934 --> 00:59:08,853
Ahh, you're a little behind
schedule yourself, kid.

1424
00:59:08,854 --> 00:59:10,292
Lookit there.

1425
00:59:10,293 --> 00:59:11,733
Mr. Legrand kept me
up half the night

1426
00:59:11,734 --> 00:59:13,172
talking about you.

1427
00:59:13,173 --> 00:59:14,613
What happened
the other half?

1428
00:59:14,614 --> 00:59:16,052
Why, you!

1429
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:17,972
[Chuckles]

1430
00:59:17,973 --> 00:59:19,892
Charlie's
a very fine man.

1431
00:59:19,893 --> 00:59:22,293
I could like him a lot.

1432
00:59:22,294 --> 00:59:24,213
You seen pop
this morning?

1433
00:59:24,214 --> 00:59:25,652
For a minute.

1434
00:59:25,653 --> 00:59:28,053
Did he ask how
it went last night?

1435
00:59:28,054 --> 00:59:29,974
I told him they all applauded.
Everyone loved you.

1436
00:59:30,453 --> 00:59:31,413
What did he say?

1437
00:59:31,414 --> 00:59:33,333
Oh, you know pop.

1438
00:59:33,685 --> 00:59:35,253
What did he say?

1439
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:40,053
He said wash your hands
before you bring him his lunch.

1440
00:59:42,933 --> 00:59:44,374
Sounds like pop.

1441
00:59:46,294 --> 00:59:47,254
Here, Danny.

1442
00:59:52,533 --> 00:59:53,493
I don't care how long

1443
00:59:53,974 --> 00:59:55,412
you've been filling out
prescriptions.

1444
00:59:55,413 --> 00:59:57,332
Maybe been filling them out
too long for all I know.

1445
00:59:57,333 --> 01:00:00,212
Will you ever understand
that I'm running the store?

1446
01:00:00,213 --> 01:00:01,653
I understand,
Mr. primont.

1447
01:00:01,654 --> 01:00:04,533
You understand, Mr. primont.
You understand, Mr. primont.

1448
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:06,454
That's what you're
getting paid for.

1449
01:00:06,933 --> 01:00:08,373
You can't teach
an old dog new tricks.

1450
01:00:08,374 --> 01:00:09,812
That's what I told furst
when he made me hire you.

1451
01:00:09,813 --> 01:00:11,204
I'm not an old dog.

1452
01:00:11,205 --> 01:00:12,692
And don't answer me back
when I talk to you!

1453
01:00:12,693 --> 01:00:14,565
Here, maybe at least you
can mop up this floor.

1454
01:00:14,645 --> 01:00:16,532
Well, go ahead
and take it.

1455
01:00:16,533 --> 01:00:17,974
Now mop over there.

1456
01:00:26,614 --> 01:00:28,534
Hey, Danny.

1457
01:00:29,013 --> 01:00:31,413
Wowie. You know you got
this whole street buzzin'?

1458
01:00:31,414 --> 01:00:32,374
Yeah?
Yeah.

1459
01:00:32,853 --> 01:00:34,772
Already they're saying
you're the next somebody.

1460
01:00:34,773 --> 01:00:37,174
And I knew you when you were
just singing for watches.

1461
01:00:37,653 --> 01:00:38,613
Well, it's a little
early to reminisce.

1462
01:00:39,094 --> 01:00:40,054
I'll see you around,
shark.

1463
01:00:40,533 --> 01:00:41,973
Maxie Fields wants
to see you, Danny.

1464
01:00:41,974 --> 01:00:42,934
Well, I don't want
to see Maxie Fields.

1465
01:00:43,413 --> 01:00:44,373
He told me to bring you.

1466
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:46,292
Well, you tell him--

1467
01:00:46,293 --> 01:00:47,733
Maxie is no guy
to give the brush to.

1468
01:00:47,734 --> 01:00:49,173
He can get rough
if he wants to.

1469
01:00:49,654 --> 01:00:51,092
You know what I mean.

1470
01:00:51,093 --> 01:00:53,013
If he wants to see me,
let him make a reservation.

1471
01:00:53,494 --> 01:00:54,932
There's three shows a night
at the creole.

1472
01:00:54,933 --> 01:00:56,853
That drugstore
you just come out...

1473
01:00:57,334 --> 01:00:59,253
That's where your old man
works now, ain't it?

1474
01:00:59,254 --> 01:01:00,214
So?

1475
01:01:00,293 --> 01:01:01,174
Nothin'. I just go in there

1476
01:01:01,653 --> 01:01:03,093
and get a pack of cigarettes
once in a while.

1477
01:01:03,094 --> 01:01:04,532
I been thinkin'.

1478
01:01:04,533 --> 01:01:05,974
If my old man was getting
knocked around like that,

1479
01:01:06,453 --> 01:01:07,413
I'd sure try to
help him if I could.

1480
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:10,773
I been working on it.

1481
01:01:10,774 --> 01:01:12,213
I'll make you a deal.

1482
01:01:12,694 --> 01:01:14,133
You come see
Maxie Fields,

1483
01:01:14,614 --> 01:01:15,574
I'll try to work up
an angle.

1484
01:01:15,575 --> 01:01:17,972
You never can tell.
You do me a favor,

1485
01:01:17,973 --> 01:01:19,414
and I'll try to do you
and your old man a favor.

1486
01:01:23,254 --> 01:01:24,214
Where's Fields?

1487
01:01:24,566 --> 01:01:26,612
I'll take you to him.

1488
01:01:26,613 --> 01:01:28,054
You know I'm on
his payroll now?

1489
01:01:28,533 --> 01:01:29,973
I am. I'm one
of his boys.

1490
01:01:29,974 --> 01:01:32,372
And that drugstore
situation...

1491
01:01:32,373 --> 01:01:33,814
Is liable to clear up
just like that.

1492
01:01:48,053 --> 01:01:51,093
Well, this is it.
Come on. Walk right in.

1493
01:01:51,094 --> 01:01:53,014
Hiya, pal.
Shark treating you okay?

1494
01:01:53,493 --> 01:01:54,453
[Grunts]

1495
01:01:54,454 --> 01:01:56,373
Go right up them stairs.
Maxie's expecting you.

1496
01:01:56,854 --> 01:01:57,814
Aren't you
coming up with me?

1497
01:01:57,814 --> 01:01:58,774
I'll wait here.

1498
01:02:16,533 --> 01:02:19,412
Oh. This is where
you live, huh?

1499
01:02:19,413 --> 01:02:20,373
This is
where I visit.

1500
01:02:20,374 --> 01:02:22,773
Maxie: What's all the chatter?
Send the kid in.

1501
01:02:28,533 --> 01:02:29,972
Hi, Danny.

1502
01:02:29,973 --> 01:02:31,413
I hear you're a smash
over at that joint.

1503
01:02:31,893 --> 01:02:34,292
Good news travels fast.
Sit down. Sit down.

1504
01:02:34,293 --> 01:02:35,732
Care for a drink?

1505
01:02:35,733 --> 01:02:37,173
No, thanks.

1506
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:39,092
Was there anything
special, Mr. Fields?

1507
01:02:39,093 --> 01:02:40,532
No, no, nothing special.

1508
01:02:40,533 --> 01:02:42,452
Just a friendly little
get-together, that's all.

1509
01:02:42,453 --> 01:02:44,373
I'm interested in any new
attraction on the street.

1510
01:02:44,853 --> 01:02:46,773
It's good for all of us.
One tie, all tie.

1511
01:02:47,253 --> 01:02:49,124
And then again,
you never know.

1512
01:02:49,125 --> 01:02:51,525
What's friendly one day
is business the next.

1513
01:02:53,813 --> 01:02:55,365
[Chuckles]

1514
01:02:55,845 --> 01:02:57,284
You've got good taste,
Danny.

1515
01:02:57,285 --> 01:02:58,724
But you know, you got
to be able to afford it.

1516
01:02:58,725 --> 01:03:00,644
Ronnie wants money
even to serve a drink.

1517
01:03:00,645 --> 01:03:01,605
Maxie,
please.

1518
01:03:02,053 --> 01:03:04,004
Serve the kid
a drink for nothin'.

1519
01:03:04,005 --> 01:03:05,444
Nah, I don't
want a drink.

1520
01:03:05,445 --> 01:03:07,364
You know, Ronnie
won a contest once.

1521
01:03:07,365 --> 01:03:09,764
Best legs
in the state of...

1522
01:03:09,765 --> 01:03:11,205
Where's that
you're from, honey?

1523
01:03:11,365 --> 01:03:12,645
Maine.

1524
01:03:12,725 --> 01:03:14,084
That's it. Maine.

1525
01:03:14,085 --> 01:03:15,045
Show the kid
your legs.

1526
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:16,965
Maxie, please.

1527
01:03:17,285 --> 01:03:19,364
Well, you won a contest
with them legs.

1528
01:03:19,365 --> 01:03:22,244
Must have been 2,000 people
watching them in the finals.

1529
01:03:22,245 --> 01:03:24,165
Don't be embarrassed.
Show the kid what won.

1530
01:03:27,525 --> 01:03:28,965
All right,
Maxie.

1531
01:03:31,844 --> 01:03:33,284
Pretty good, huh?

1532
01:03:33,285 --> 01:03:35,204
And there's nothing wrong
with the rest of it.

1533
01:03:35,205 --> 01:03:36,643
I gotta get going.

1534
01:03:36,644 --> 01:03:37,604
All right, kid.

1535
01:03:37,604 --> 01:03:38,564
I just wanted to have
this little chat with you,

1536
01:03:39,045 --> 01:03:40,483
get to know you
a little better.

1537
01:03:40,484 --> 01:03:42,884
I like to see
people get ahead.

1538
01:03:42,885 --> 01:03:44,323
And like I said,
who knows?

1539
01:03:44,324 --> 01:03:46,244
Maybe someday we'll be
doing business together.

1540
01:03:46,725 --> 01:03:48,163
You may be working
for me again.

1541
01:03:48,164 --> 01:03:49,605
I don't think so,
Mr. Fields.

1542
01:03:50,084 --> 01:03:52,963
You never can tell.
Wheel comes around.

1543
01:03:52,964 --> 01:03:54,404
After all,
I saw you first.

1544
01:03:54,405 --> 01:03:56,803
I gotta admit, I was a little
put out when you quit.

1545
01:03:56,804 --> 01:03:58,724
Especially to go
with a crumb like Legrand.

1546
01:03:59,205 --> 01:04:00,643
Charlie's no crumb.

1547
01:04:00,644 --> 01:04:02,084
He's a pretty
decent fella.

1548
01:04:02,085 --> 01:04:04,005
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

1549
01:04:04,484 --> 01:04:06,403
I forgot about him
and your sister.

1550
01:04:06,404 --> 01:04:08,805
Eh, this has been quite
a week for Charlie.

1551
01:04:09,284 --> 01:04:10,244
First, he finds
himself a singer,

1552
01:04:10,245 --> 01:04:11,685
then he finds himself
a girl.

1553
01:04:12,164 --> 01:04:14,084
You're some
talented family.

1554
01:04:14,565 --> 01:04:15,525
What are you
trying to say?

1555
01:04:16,004 --> 01:04:18,404
I got only one thing
to say, kid...

1556
01:04:18,405 --> 01:04:20,324
I don't like losing things.

1557
01:04:20,325 --> 01:04:22,244
I don't mind taking,
but I don't like to lose.

1558
01:04:22,245 --> 01:04:23,683
Not even a busboy.

1559
01:04:23,684 --> 01:04:25,603
When I lose something,
I want it back,

1560
01:04:25,604 --> 01:04:27,524
and sooner or later,
I get it.

1561
01:04:28,005 --> 01:04:29,443
That's all.

1562
01:04:29,444 --> 01:04:31,363
You got a long way
to go, boy.

1563
01:04:31,364 --> 01:04:32,805
Lots and lots
of good luck.

1564
01:04:33,284 --> 01:04:34,725
Show him to the door,
will you, honey?

1565
01:04:41,445 --> 01:04:43,843
[Softly] Don't come
back here anymore, Danny.

1566
01:04:43,844 --> 01:04:45,763
Stay far, far away.

1567

doc?

1739
01:11:45,652 --> 01:11:47,092
He's alive. Just.

1740
01:11:47,572 --> 01:11:48,532
There's been damage
to the brain.

1741
01:11:49,012 --> 01:11:50,931
We've relieved
the pressure temporarily,

1742
01:11:50,932 --> 01:11:52,851
but he's going to need another
operation immediately.

1743
01:11:52,852 --> 01:11:54,291
A delicate one.

1744
01:11:54,292 --> 01:11:56,211
Cabot.

1745
01:11:56,212 --> 01:11:59,571
Dr. Martin cabot has performed
this kind of operation.

1746
01:11:59,572 --> 01:12:01,011
Is he good?

1747
01:12:01,012 --> 01:12:02,932
He's the best,
but expensive.

1748
01:12:03,412 --> 01:12:04,324
How expensive?

1749
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:08,211
Oh, a couple of thousand,
maybe more.

1750
01:12:08,212 --> 01:12:10,131
I'm still deep in hock,

1751
01:12:10,132 --> 01:12:12,052
but maybe
I can scrape up 500.

1752
01:12:13,492 --> 01:12:15,204
We'll get it someway.

1753
01:12:20,692 --> 01:12:22,611
Dr. Patrick.
Where's this man?

1754
01:12:22,612 --> 01:12:24,052
Where's this Fisher?

1755
01:12:24,532 --> 01:12:25,971
Dr. cabot!

1756
01:12:25,972 --> 01:12:27,891
You know,
it took me a whole year

1757
01:12:27,892 --> 01:12:29,811
to wangle this dinner
invitation. Lucy pitman.

1758
01:12:29,812 --> 01:12:31,731
Well, anything
for Maxie Fields.

1759
01:12:31,732 --> 01:12:33,172
Thank you.

1760
01:12:33,652 --> 01:12:34,612
You the boy?

1761
01:12:35,092 --> 01:12:35,572
Yes, sir.

1762
01:12:36,052 --> 01:12:37,491
Mr. Fields must be
very fond of you.

1763
01:12:37,492 --> 01:12:39,411
Said you used
to work for him.

1764
01:12:39,412 --> 01:12:40,852
When he heard about this,
he wanted to help out.

1765
01:12:41,044 --> 01:12:43,251
Well, let's go.

1766
01:12:43,252 --> 01:12:44,692
When you work
for Maxie Fields,

1767
01:12:45,172 --> 01:12:46,612
it's better
than blue cross.

1768
01:12:47,092 --> 01:12:48,052
What's the case?

1769
01:12:57,652 --> 01:12:59,571
They've been in there
for hours.

1770
01:12:59,572 --> 01:13:01,972
Must be some kind
of world's record.

1771
01:13:05,812 --> 01:13:07,732
[Elevator doors open]

1772
01:13:12,052 --> 01:13:13,491
He made it.

1773
01:13:13,492 --> 01:13:15,891
Oh, thank god.

1774
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:16,852
Well, I think
I'm going to go home.

1775
01:13:17,332 --> 01:13:18,292
No sense in going
to that dinner party.

1776
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:20,212
Lucy gives me
a pain anyway.

1777
01:13:20,692 --> 01:13:21,652
Thank you,
doctor.

1778
01:13:21,653 --> 01:13:23,092
He's going
to be all right.

1779
01:13:23,572 --> 01:13:25,011
May take
a little while, though.

1780
01:13:25,012 --> 01:13:26,452
But he's a strong man.
A real fighter.

1781
01:13:26,932 --> 01:13:29,331
But, doc, about
Maxie Fields. How--

1782
01:13:29,332 --> 01:13:31,251
Strange man, isn't he?

1783
01:13:31,252 --> 01:13:34,611
Very coarse, vulgar,
very powerful.

1784
01:13:34,612 --> 01:13:37,011
Send him my best.
I'll send him my bill.

1785
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:39,412
Thank you, doctor.
Thank you.

1786
01:13:45,652 --> 01:13:48,051
[Crying] I'll
pay him back, sis.

1787
01:13:48,052 --> 01:13:49,492
I'll pay every cent.

1788
01:13:58,132 --> 01:14:01,491
I got a lot of
payin' back to do.

1789
01:14:01,492 --> 01:14:03,412
A lot of payin' back.

1790

Doorman: Soon as
the show breaks, folks,

1791
01:14:07,252 --> 01:14:09,171
there'll be plenty
of tables for everyone.

1792
01:14:09,172 --> 01:14:11,091
Just stand in line
and don't go away.

1793
01:14:11,092 --> 01:14:12,531
It's a fabulous show.

1794
01:14:12,532 --> 01:14:13,971
This kid is absolutely
sensational!

1795
01:14:13,972 --> 01:14:16,851
Just be patient, folks.
It won't be very long now.

1797
01:14:18,292 --> 01:14:19,252
Good evening, folks.

1798

Hi.

1799
01:14:20,213 --> 01:14:21,651
Good evening, miss Fisher.
How's your father?

1800
01:14:21,652 --> 01:14:22,612
Oh, much better,
thanks.

1801

want to see him.

I got to bring them.

01:17:35,092 --> 01:17:37,011
go up the stairs,
and turn the lock.

for a little guy,

you make an
awful lot of noise.

1870
01:17:42,291 --> 01:17:45,170
Now, for a little guy,
I'm remembering a rainy night

1871
01:17:45,171 --> 01:17:46,611
and a man carrying
a bag of money.

1872
01:17:46,612 --> 01:17:49,010
Now, your old man,
he's been in that hospital

1873
01:17:49,011 --> 01:17:50,930
about a month now,
ain't that right?

1874
01:17:50,931 --> 01:17:52,850
And I hear
he gets out tomorrow,

1875
01:17:52,851 --> 01:17:54,292
and I'm real glad
about that.

1879
01:18:01,972 --> 01:18:03,892

for you.

Every time I see him
lying down,

1900
01:19:26,931 --> 01:19:28,372
I keep looking
at his chest

1901
01:19:28,851 --> 01:19:30,291
and hoping.

1902
01:19:30,292 --> 01:19:33,172
But the pig keeps
right on breathing.

1903
01:19:35,043 --> 01:19:37,011

see me tonight.

to see you tonight.

01:19:42,291 --> 01:19:43,731
What about?

1908
01:19:43,732 --> 01:19:45,651
We wants you to quit
Charlie Legrand

1909
01:19:45,652 --> 01:19:47,090
and go to work for him.

1910
01:19:47,091 --> 01:19:49,010
And what are you
supposed to do about it?

1911
01:19:49,011 --> 01:19:50,930
Whatever
I can do about it.

1912
01:19:50,931 --> 01:19:52,371
Your heart
wouldn't be in it.

1913
01:19:52,372 --> 01:19:53,811
You wouldn't miss it.

1914
01:19:54,771 --> 01:19:56,690
Would you like a drink?

1915
01:19:56,691 --> 01:19:58,610
Would you like
a cigarette?

1916
01:19:58,611 --> 01:20:00,051
Shall we talk?

1917
01:20:00,052 --> 01:20:01,490
Can I do anything
for you?

1918
01:20:01,491 --> 01:20:02,931
Anything at all?

1919
01:20:02,932 --> 01:20:04,851
The general idea is...

1920
01:20:04,852 --> 01:20:06,772
I'm supposed
to befriend you.

1921
01:20:07,732 --> 01:20:10,130
You know, for a--a...

1922
01:20:10,131 --> 01:20:13,491
For a bum? A tramp?
For what?

1923
01:20:13,492 --> 01:20:14,930
Oh, I was just gonna say

1924
01:20:14,931 --> 01:20:16,371
you got a pretty good
way of talking.

1925
01:20:16,372 --> 01:20:18,770
Hmm.
You'd be surprised

1926
01:20:18,771 --> 01:20:20,690
how many tramps graduate
school with honors.

1927
01:20:20,691 --> 01:20:22,132
As a matter of fact, me.

1928
01:20:22,611 --> 01:20:24,531
Well, I flunked
without honors.

1929
01:20:25,972 --> 01:20:27,410
I'm sorry,
but I don't think

1930
01:20:27,411 --> 01:20:29,811
I'm going to be able
to handle this setup.

1931
01:20:29,812 --> 01:20:31,732
This is a setup,
isn't it?

1932
01:20:32,692 --> 01:20:34,611
It was all fixed
in advance.

1933
01:20:34,612 --> 01:20:35,572
Mmm.

1934
01:20:36,532 --> 01:20:38,451
You tell Maxie Fields
that I wasn't in the mood.

1935
01:20:38,452 --> 01:20:40,371
I'll be square with him
in a few months.

1936
01:20:40,372 --> 01:20:41,810
I won't owe him
anything,

1937
01:20:41,811 --> 01:20:43,731
and that's the way
I wanna keep it.

1938
01:20:43,923 --> 01:20:45,650
Danny...

1939
01:20:45,651 --> 01:20:47,092
I wish
you wouldn't go.

1940
01:20:48,052 --> 01:20:49,971
This isn't the accident,
honey.

1941
01:20:49,972 --> 01:20:52,370
The accident happened
that first morning

1942
01:20:52,371 --> 01:20:53,811
in the blue shade.

1943
01:20:53,812 --> 01:20:55,731
From then on,
everything's been fixed

1944
01:20:55,732 --> 01:20:57,651
just like
a crooked fight.

1945
01:20:57,652 --> 01:21:00,050
And you're wrong
about the heart.

1946
01:21:00,051 --> 01:21:01,491
I do miss it.

1947
01:21:01,492 --> 01:21:03,890
I miss it so much
there's a girl I may marry

1948
01:21:03,891 --> 01:21:05,810
just because she has one
to give me.

1949
01:21:05,811 --> 01:21:07,730
I'm not asking you
to marry me.

1950
01:21:07,731 --> 01:21:09,171
Well, you're asking me
something.

1951
01:21:09,172 --> 01:21:10,611
You're a little tight,
aren't you?

1952
01:21:10,771 --> 01:21:13,490
I'm not tight.
I'm drunk.

1953
01:21:13,491 --> 01:21:15,891
But I'll tell you
what you are.

1954
01:21:15,892 --> 01:21:17,811
You're being rude.

1955
01:21:17,812 --> 01:21:19,731
You're condemning me

1956
01:21:19,732 --> 01:21:21,651
and ignoring
my god-given charms.

1957
01:21:21,652 --> 01:21:23,571
God didn't give you
the charms

1958
01:21:23,572 --> 01:21:25,492
for what you're using
them for, honey.

1959
01:21:26,931 --> 01:21:27,891
That's funny.

1960
01:21:27,892 --> 01:21:30,770
And I read the instructions
so carefully.

1961
01:21:30,771 --> 01:21:32,212
Danny...

1962
01:21:33,172 --> 01:21:35,091
Please don't go.

1963
01:21:35,092 --> 01:21:36,052
Come here.

1964
01:21:36,053 --> 01:21:37,491
I want to show you
something.

1965
01:21:41,331 --> 01:21:42,291
Look.

1966
01:21:45,652 --> 01:21:48,050
What's he doing
down there?

1967
01:21:48,051 --> 01:21:49,970
He has orders
from the pig

1968
01:21:49,971 --> 01:21:52,371
to clock your entrance
and exit.

1969
01:21:52,372 --> 01:21:55,251
You see, you're supposed
to spend a few hours here,

1970
01:21:55,252 --> 01:21:56,690
and in those few hours,

1971
01:21:56,691 --> 01:21:58,611
acquire the habit
of coming back.

1972
01:22:00,691 --> 01:22:01,971
In due time,

1973
01:22:01,972 --> 01:22:03,891
Mr. Fields will
approach you

1974
01:22:03,892 --> 01:22:05,331
with a bill
for my graciousness.

1975
01:22:05,812 --> 01:22:07,251
Double-cross
Charlie Legrand.

1976
01:22:07,732 --> 01:22:08,692
Exactly.

1977
01:22:08,693 --> 01:22:10,612
What if I leave now?

1978
01:22:11,572 --> 01:22:14,452
Then the pig will punish me
for having failed.

1979
01:22:15,412 --> 01:22:16,851
If you were kind,

1980
01:22:17,332 --> 01:22:19,251
you'd stay
for a few hours

1981
01:22:19,252 --> 01:22:21,171
and just pretend
like you like me.

1982
01:22:21,172 --> 01:22:23,091
We could--we could
smoke some cigarettes.

1983
01:22:23,092 --> 01:22:25,011
We could play some music.

1984
01:22:25,012 --> 01:22:27,891
Just make it seem
as though I have charm.

1985
01:22:27,892 --> 01:22:30,772
I--i could sing
some songs for you.

1986
01:22:31,732 --> 01:22:34,131
I used to be a singer,
you know?

1987
01:22:35,572 --> 01:22:37,011
Yes, I did.

Yeah.

1997
01:22:57,172 --> 01:22:58,611
That's a real oldie.

1998
01:22:58,612 --> 01:23:01,011
Used to be
my theme song.

1999
01:23:02,931 --> 01:23:04,850
I ask you to stay

2000
01:23:04,851 --> 01:23:07,730
because I hate to be
punished by Mr. Fields.

2001
01:23:07,731 --> 01:23:09,651
He's not a very
sensitive man.

2002
01:23:13,012 --> 01:23:14,931
All right.

2003
01:23:14,932 --> 01:23:16,852
I-I'll stay.

2004
01:23:18,772 --> 01:23:20,211
And i...

2005
01:23:20,692 --> 01:23:22,612
I think you
arecharming.

2006
01:23:23,572 --> 01:23:25,491
I don't use that word,
but you are.

2007
01:23:25,492 --> 01:23:26,931
Thank you.

2008
01:23:27,891 --> 01:23:28,851
Oh.

2009
01:23:28,851 --> 01:23:29,811
Ohh.

2010
01:23:29,811 --> 01:23:30,771
Ah, Ronnie.

2011
01:23:30,771 --> 01:23:31,731
I'm sorry.

2012
01:23:31,731 --> 01:23:32,691
Don't--don't cry.

2013
01:23:32,691 --> 01:23:33,651
You'll wake up
the circus master.

2014
01:23:34,132 --> 01:23:36,052
Oh, Danny, hold me.
Hold me, please.

2015
01:23:37,972 --> 01:23:40,370
Ronnie, what are you
doing here with this man?

2016
01:23:40,371 --> 01:23:42,290
How'd you get
into this?

2017
01:23:42,291 --> 01:23:44,211
How do you get out?

2018
01:23:49,011 --> 01:23:49,971
Go home, Danny.
Go home.

2019
01:23:50,452 --> 01:23:50,931
Ronnie, please.

2020
01:23:51,412 --> 01:23:53,332
No, no. Not here.
Not in this house.

2021
01:23:53,811 --> 01:23:55,252
I wouldn't know if it
was because I wanted you

2022
01:23:55,731 --> 01:23:56,691
or because
Maxie wanted you.

2023
01:23:57,172 --> 01:23:58,132
Maxie's got nothing
to do with it.

2024
01:23:58,611 --> 01:24:00,052
Maxie:
I wouldn't be too sure.

2025
01:24:00,404 --> 01:24:02,450
Sorry to intrude. Uh...

2026
01:24:02,451 --> 01:24:03,891
I don't mind you two

2027
01:24:03,892 --> 01:24:05,331
wrestling around
a little bit together,

2028
01:24:05,812 --> 01:24:07,251
but as everyone knows,
wrestling is all a fake.

2029
01:24:07,732 --> 01:24:09,170
Let's not forget
who's supposed to win--

2030
01:24:09,171 --> 01:24:10,611
Me.

2031
01:24:10,612 --> 01:24:12,532
I told you once before.
I'm not gonna work for you.

2032
01:24:13,011 --> 01:24:13,971
Well, it's too bad.

2033
01:24:14,452 --> 01:24:15,891
I was hoping
it could be arranged

2034
01:24:16,372 --> 01:24:18,292
on some kind
of a friendly basis.

2035
01:24:18,771 --> 01:24:19,731
But...

2036
01:24:20,212 --> 01:24:21,651
It can be done
the other way, too.

2037
01:24:24,531 --> 01:24:25,972
Now, you listen to me,
punk.

2038
01:24:26,451 --> 01:24:27,892
You're gonna work
at my club.

2039
01:24:28,371 --> 01:24:29,331
I can do a lot for you,

2040
01:24:29,812 --> 01:24:31,251
and I can do a lot
against you.

2041
01:24:31,732 --> 01:24:34,130
Your old man's coming out
of the hospital tomorrow.

2042
01:24:34,131 --> 01:24:35,572
Might not be so good
for his health

2043
01:24:36,051 --> 01:24:37,971
if he found out it was you
who help put him there.

2044
01:24:38,452 --> 01:24:39,412
It was an accident.

2045
01:24:39,412 --> 01:24:40,372
Was it?

2046
01:24:40,373 --> 01:24:41,810
Somebody was gonna
get hit.

2047
01:24:41,811 --> 01:24:43,251
Too bad it was him.

2048
01:24:43,252 --> 01:24:44,690
But you were in
on it.

2049
01:24:44,691 --> 01:24:46,130
It was all done
because of you.

2050
01:24:46,131 --> 01:24:47,570
You don't think
he'd mind?

2051
01:24:47,571 --> 01:24:48,531
Okay, you tell him.

2052
01:24:49,011 --> 01:24:49,971
Or shall I?

2053
01:24:50,451 --> 01:24:51,891
You do it,
and I'll kill you.

2054
01:24:52,371 --> 01:24:54,290
I got an easier way.

2055
01:24:54,291 --> 01:24:55,730
All you gotta do

2056
01:24:55,731 --> 01:24:57,170
is sign this little
piece of paper.

2057
01:24:57,171 --> 01:24:58,131
There's nothing on it,

2058
01:24:58,611 --> 01:24:59,571
but don't worry.
I'll fill it in later.

2059
01:24:59,572 --> 01:25:01,490
No, Danny. No!

2060
01:25:01,491 --> 01:25:02,930
Shut up.

2061
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:05,330
Or maybe you'd like me
to fill Charlie's place

2062
01:25:05,331 --> 01:25:06,771
with stink bombs
every night.

2063
01:25:07,251 --> 01:25:09,171
Or if that's
an unpleasant thought,

2064
01:25:09,651 --> 01:25:10,611
how about real bombs?

2065
01:25:10,612 --> 01:25:12,050
You think I wouldn't?

2066
01:25:12,051 --> 01:25:14,451
Everything goes boom.
Easiest thing in the world.

2067
01:25:14,931 --> 01:25:16,370
Make it all look
like an accident.

2068
01:25:16,371 --> 01:25:18,291
Anything can be made
to look like an accident.

2069
01:25:18,723 --> 01:25:20,691
What do you say, kid?

2070
01:25:37,491 --> 01:25:39,891
Well, that's
more like it.

2071
01:25:40,851 --> 01:25:43,250
Now, don't let me
interrupt you any longer.

2072
01:25:43,251 --> 01:25:46,130
You were just saying
to her, um...

2073
01:25:46,131 --> 01:25:48,531
"Maxie has nothing
to do with it."

2074
01:25:54,291 --> 01:25:56,210
So now you know.

2075
01:25:56,211 --> 01:25:58,611
That's how
you get into it.

2076
01:26:00,051 --> 01:26:02,930
Now Maxie's got you
like he's got me.

2077
01:26:02,931 --> 01:26:04,371
It's too late.

2078
01:26:07,251 --> 01:26:10,130
You do something wrong...

2079
01:26:10,131 --> 01:26:12,531
And that makes you
do something worse.

2080
01:26:12,643 --> 01:26:13,970
And the first thing
you know,
