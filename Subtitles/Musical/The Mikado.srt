We loved each other at once...

123

guardian Ko-Ko, a cheap tailor...

a month ago...

126

that Ko-Ko had been condemned
to death for flirting.

I should find Yum-Yum at liberty.

171
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:04,541

You will understand this when I tell
you that I can trace my ancestry back...

179
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:34,571
to a protoplasmal primordial
atomic globule.

180
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:39,159
Consequently, my family pride
is something inconceivable.

181
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:43,663
I can't help it.
I was born sneering.

182
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:46,833
But I struggle hard
to overcome this defect.

183
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:50,170
I mortify my pride continually.

184
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:53,673
When all the great officers
of state resigned in a body...

185
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:57,594
because they were too proud
to serve under an ex-tailor...

186
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:02,390
did I not unhesitatingly accept
all their posts at once?

187
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,351
And the salaries attached to them?

188
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:07,312
- Oh.
- You did.

189
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,440
A Pooh-Bah paid for his services!

190
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:13,068
I a salaried minion!

191
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,653
But I do it.

192
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:18,740
It revolts me, but I do it.

193
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,325
And it does you credit.

194
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,161
But I don't stop at that.

195
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:27,207
I also retail state secrets
at a very low figure.

196
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,960
- For instance -
- Any information about Yum-Yum -

197
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:33,213
Would come under the head
of a state secret.

198
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:42,472
Another insult,
and, I think, a light one.

Oh, Pooh-Bah, Pooh-Bah.

233
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:20,065
It seems that the
festivities in connection...

234
00:22:20,066 --> 00:22:21,966
...with my approaching
marriage must last a week.

235
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,634
Now I should like to do the thing
handsomely, and I want to consult you...

236
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,553
as to the amount I ought to spend
upon them.

237
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:28,638
Certainly. In which
of my capacities?

238
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:31,808
As first lord of the treasury,
lord chamberlain...

239
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,811
attorney general,
chancellor of the exchequer...

240
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,605
privy purse or private secretary?

241
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,816
Suppose we say as private secretary.

242
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,235
Speaking as your private secretary...

243
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:47,323
I should say that, as the city will have
to pay for it, don't stint yourself.

244
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,409
- Do it well.
- Exactly.

245
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,328
As the city will have to pay for it -
that is your advice.

246
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:55,498
Of course,
as chancellor of the exchequer...

247
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:59,836
I am bound to see that
due economy is observed.

248
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,048
Oh, but you said just now,
"Don't stint yourself. Do it well."

249
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,050
As private secretary.

250
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:07,635
And now you say
that due economy must be observed.

251
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,847
As chancellor of the exchequer.

252
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,099
I see.

253
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,854
Come over here where the
chancellor can't hear us.

254
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,981
Now then, as my solicitor...

255
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,609
how would you advise me to
deal with this difficulty?

256
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:26,362
Oh, as your solicitor, I should have
no hesitation in saying "Chance it."

257
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:29,365
- Thanks. I will. - If it were not
that, as lord chief justice...

258
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,703
I am bound to see
that the law isn't violated.

259
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:43,588
Now then,
as first lord of the treasury?

260
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,882
Of course,
as first lord of the treasury...

261
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:50,553
I could propose a special vote
that would cover all expenses -

262
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,972
if it were not that,
as leader of the opposition...

263
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:57,435
it would be my duty
to resist it tooth and nail.

264
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:04,067
Or, as paymaster general,
I could so cook the accounts...

265
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:08,613
that, as lord high auditor,
I should never discover the fraud.

266
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:12,075
But... as archbishop of Titipu...

267
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,411
it would be my duty
to denounce my dishonesty...

268
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:20,917
and give myself into my own custody
as first commissioner of police.

269
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,086
That's extremely awkward.

270
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:28,925
I don't say that all these distinguished
people couldn't be squared.

271
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,262

Oh, but you're not going to kiss

Well, that was the idea.

307
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:02,453
- It seems odd, doesn't it?
- It's rather peculiar.

308
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:05,999
Oh, I expect it's all right.
Must have a beginning, you know.

309
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,336
Well, of course.
I know nothing about these things.

00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:14,465
But I've no objection...
if it's usual.

Oh, it's quite usual...

312
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,177
I think.

00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,888
Eh, Lord Chamberlain?

00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,685

Thank goodness that's over.

seen you for ever so long!

318
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:45,371
I've come home for good.
And I'm not going back anymore!

319
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:47,790
I beg your pardon,
but will you present me?

320
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,542
Oh, this is the gentleman -

321
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,627
One at a time, please.

322
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:55,298
If you please. He is the gentleman
who used to play so beautifully on the -

323
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,883
Oh, on the, uh - on the -

324
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,551
On the Marine Parade.

325
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:01,846
Oh, sir, I have the misfortune
to love your ward Yum-Yum.

326
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,973
Oh, I know I deserve your anger.

327
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,017
You -

328
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:16,069
Anger? Not a bit, my boy.

329
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,488
Why, I love her myself.

330
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:22,325
Charming little girl, isn't she?
Pretty eyes, nice hair.

331
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,410
Taking little thing altogether.

332
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:28,664
Very glad to hear my opinion
backed by a competent authority.

333
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:31,334
Thank you very much. Good-bye.

334
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,919
Take him away.

335
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,670
Oh!

336
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:51,479
Yum-Yum!

337
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:53,523
Oh, at last we're alone.

338
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:55,525
I've sought you night and day
for three weeks...

339
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,860
with the belief that your guardian
was beheaded.

340
00:28:57,945 --> 00:29:01,364
But now I find that you're about
to be married to him this afternoon.

341
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,949
Yes.

342
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,868
But you do not love him?

343
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:07,120
No.

344
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,205
Oh, why don't you refuse him?

345
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,790
What good would that do?

346
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:14,001
He is my guardian,
and he wouldn't let me marry you.

347
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:18,381
Besides, a wand'ring minstrel who plays
a wind instrument outside teahouses...

348
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:21,968
is hardly a fitting husband for
the ward of the Lord High Executioner.

349
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:24,554
Oh, but...

350
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:27,306
what if it should prove
that after all I am no musician?

351
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:30,726
There! I was certain of it,
directly I heard you play.

352
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:32,437
Oh, it -

353
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,632
But what if it should
prove that I am...

354
00:29:34,633 --> 00:29:36,733
...the son of His
Majesty the Mikado?

355
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:39,569
- The son of the Mikado?
- Oh! Shh, shh, shh!

356
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,574
But why is Your Highness disguised?

357
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:48,578
And what has Your Highness done? And will
Your Highness promise never to do it again?

358
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:54,041
Some years ago I had the misfortune
to captivate Katisha...

359
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,085
an elderly lady of my father's court.

360
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:59,755
My father ordered me to marry her
within a week or perish on a scaffold.

361
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,759
That night I fled his court and, assuming
the disguise of a second trombone...

362
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:05,887
I joined the band in
which you found me.

395
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:55,931
I am the bearer of a letter
from His Majesty, the Mikado.

396
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:59,018
A letter from the Mikado?

397
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:06,859
What in the world
can he have to say to me?

398
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,200
Ah, here it is at last.

399
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:19,622
I thought it would come
sooner or late - later.

400
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:29,131
The Mikado is struck by the fact...

401
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:32,718
that no executions have taken
place in Titipu for a year.

402
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:38,724
And he decrees that unless someone
is beheaded within one month...

403
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:44,647
the post of Lord High Executioner
shall be abolished!

404
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:51,195
And the city reduced
to the rank of a village!

405
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,281
There's no help for it.

406
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:57,493
I shall have to execute
somebody at once.

407
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:03,207
The only question is,
who shall it be?

408
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,668
Well, it seems unkind to say so...

409
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:09,338
but as you're already under
sentence of death for flirting...

410
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:12,007
everything seems to point to you.

411
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:18,681
To - To me? Wh-What are you talking
about? I can't execute myself.

412
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,349
Why not?

413
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:22,977
I don't see how a man can
cut off his own head.

414
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,771
A man might try.

415
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:28,858
If he only succeeded
in cutting it half off -

416
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,279
that would be something.

417
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:38,117
No. Pardon me, but
there I am adamant.

418
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:41,746
I am afraid that unless
you can obtain a substitute -

419
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,330
A substitute?

420
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:45,875
Nothing easier.

421
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:53,549
Pooh-Bah, I appoint you
lord high substitute.

422
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,217
I should be delighted.

423
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:58,888
Such an appointment would
realize my fondest dreams!

424
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,350
But, no, at any sacrifice...

425
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:08,647

00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:53,956

Nonsense!

00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,040
What for?

486
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,042
Because you're going to marry
the girl I adore.

487
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:59,086
Nonsense, sir.
I won't permit it.

00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,922
I am a humane man, and if you
attempt anything of the kind...

00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:03,632
I shall order your instant arrest.

490
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:06,301
Come, sir. Desist at once,
or I summon my guard.

491
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:08,220
That's absurd. If you attempt
to raise an alarm...

492
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,556
I instantly perform the happy
dispatch with this dagger.

493
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,307
No, no! Don't do that!

494
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,146
Why, this is horrible.

495
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,064
You cold-blooded scoundrel.

496
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:22,151
Are you aware that in taking your
life you're committing a crime?

497
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:23,819
Committing a crime which -

498
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:25,571
which -

499
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,076
The substitute!

500
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:34,329
What's the matter?

501
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:36,915
Is it absolutely certain
that you're resolved to die?

502
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Absolutely.

503
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,169
- Will nothing shake your
resolution? - Nothing.

504
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,139
Then, if you really
mean what you say,

505
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,340
...don't spoil yourself
by committing suicide...

506
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:48,677
but be beheaded handsomely at
the hands of the public executioner.

507
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:51,180
- I don't see how that would
benefit me. - You don't?

508
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:55,267
Observe.

509
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:59,354
You'll have a month to live, and you'll
live like a fighting cock at my expense.

510
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:02,191
When the day comes, there'll
be a grand public ceremonial.

511
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:03,942
You will be the central figure.

512
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:06,653
No one will attempt to deprive you
of that distinction.

513
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:10,199
There'll be a procession,
bands, dead march, bells tolling...

514
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:12,367
all the girls in tears -

515
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:15,037
Yum-Yum distracted.

516
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:18,207
Then, when it's all over,
general rejoicings...

517
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:21,543
and a display of fireworks
in the evening!

518
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:24,797
You won't see them, but
they'll be there all the same.

519
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:27,966
Do you think Yum-Yum will
really be distracted at my death?

520
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:32,721
I'm convinced of it. Bless you, she's the
most tenderhearted little creature alive.

521
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:35,140
I should be sorry to cause her pain.

522
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:37,726
Perhaps, after all,
if I were to withdraw from Japan...

523
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:41,063
and travel in Europe for a couple of
years, I might contrive to forget her.

524
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:44,233
Oh, I don't think you could
forget Yum-Yum so easily.

525
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:49,822
And, after all, what is more
miserable than a love-blighted life?

526
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:50,864
True.

527
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:55,244
Life without Yum-Yum.

528
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:58,330
Why, it seems absurd.

529
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:01,333
And yet there are a great many people
in the world who have to endure it.

530
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:06,088
Poor devils, yes! You're quite
right not to be of their number.

531
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,924
I won't be of their number!

532
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,509
Noble fellow!

533
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,094
I'll tell you how we'll manage it.

534
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:15,806
Let me marry Yum-Yum tomorrow...

535
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,599
and in a month you may behead me.

536
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:21,103
No. No. I draw the line at Yum-Yum.

537
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,188
Very good. If you can draw
the line, so can I.

538
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:26,191
No! Stop! Listen one moment!
Be reasonable.

539
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:28,777
She'll be a widow in a month,
and you can marry her then.

540
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:33,365
Yes, that's true, of course.
I quite see that.

541
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:38,036
But dear me. My position during
the next month will be most unpleasant.

542
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:40,372
Most unpleasant.

543
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,749
Not half so unpleasant
as my position at the end of it.

544
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,043
Yes, but dear me -

545
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:47,629
Oh, very well. I agree.

546
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:51,967
After all, it's only putting off
one's wedding for a month.

547
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:55,888
But you won't prejudice her
against me, will you?

548
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:58,765
You see, I've educated
her to be my wife.

549
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:02,811
She's been taught to regard me
as a wise and good man.

550
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:05,981
Now, I shouldn't like her views
on that point disturbed.

551
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:10,569

708

Everything seems to smile upon me.

709
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:38,423
I'm to be married today
to the man I love best...

710
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:40,925
and I believe
I'm the very happiest girl in Japan.

711
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:42,760
Well, dear, it can't be denied...

712
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:45,555
that the fact that your husband
is to be beheaded in a month...

713
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:47,557
is, in its way, a drawback.

714
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,893
It does seem to
take the top off it, you know.

715
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:52,186
I don't know about that.
It all depends.

716
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:54,272
At all events, he will
find it a drawback.

717
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:57,442
Not necessarily, bless you.
It all depends.

718
00:53:57,526 --> 00:54:00,403
Oh! I think it very
indelicate of you...

719
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:03,615
to refer to such a subject
on such a day.

720
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,618
If my married happiness
is to be - to be -

721
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:07,952
Cut short?

722
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:10,496
Well, cut short in a month...

723
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:12,540
can't you let me forget it?

724
00:54:24,887 --> 00:54:28,973
Yum-Yum! Yum-Yum in tears -
and on her wedding morn?

725
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:35,897
They've been reminding me that
in a month you're to be beheaded.

726
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:38,399
A month? Why, what's a month?

727
00:54:38,484 --> 00:54:40,735
These divisions of time
are purely arbitrary.

728
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:42,737
Who says 24 hours make a day?

729
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:45,073
There's a popular impression
to that effect.

730
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:47,700
Then we'll efface it.

731
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:50,203
We'll call each second a minute -
each minute an hour...

732
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,622
each hour a day
and each day a year.

733
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:56,542
Oh, at that rate, we've about 30 years
of married happiness before us.

734
00:54:56,627 --> 00:55:00,964
Yes. How time flies when one
is thoroughly enjoying oneself.

735
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:03,675
That's the way to look at it.
Don't let's be downhearted.

736
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:05,760

to every cloud.

768
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:14,305
Never mind.
I must get used to it.

769
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:16,724
Only please do it by degrees.

770
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:19,769
Begin by placing your
arm around her waist.

771
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:24,023
No, no.

772
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:27,318
Not yet. Let me get used
to that first.

773
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:29,403
Oh, wouldn't you like to retire?

774
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:31,697
It must pain you to see us
so affectionate together.

775
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:34,867
No. I must learn to bear it.

776
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:39,122
Now oblige me by allowing her
head to rest on your shoulder.

777
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,085
Like that?

778
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:47,922
I'm much obliged to you.

779
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:51,217
Now, k -

780
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:52,510
k- k-k -

781
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,262
kiss her.

782
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,724
Thank you.

783
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:01,811
Thank you.

784
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:03,896
It's simple torture!

785
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:08,860
Oh. Oh, come, come. Bear up.
After all, it's only for a month.

786
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:13,364
No. It's no use deluding oneself
with false hopes.

787
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:18,703
- What do you mean?
- My child. My poor child.

788
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:22,582
My little bride that
was to have been.

789
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:24,709
"Was to have been"?

790
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:26,544
You never can be mine.

791
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:27,879
- Oh!
- What?

792
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:29,964
Oh, I'm so glad!

793
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:34,510
I've just ascertained
that, by the Mikado's law...

794
00:58:34,595 --> 00:58:38,222
when a married man is beheaded,
his wife is buried alive.

795
00:58:38,307 --> 00:58:40,600
- Buried alive?
- Buried alive!

796
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:42,935
Buried alive.

797
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:48,149
It's a most unpleasant death.

798
00:58:48,817 --> 00:58:51,652
- But whom did you get that from?
- Oh, from Pooh-Bah.

799
00:58:51,737 --> 00:58:54,322
- He's my solicitor.
- But he may be mistaken.

800
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:57,700
So I thought. So I consulted the
attorney general, the lord chief justice...

801
00:58:57,784 --> 00:59:00,745
the master of the rolls, the judge
ordinary and the lord chancellor.

802
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:02,705
They're all of the same opinion.

803
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:06,083
Never knew such unanimity
on a point of law in my life.

804
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:08,586
But stop a bit. This law
has never been put in force.

805
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:14,425
Not yet. You see, flirting is the only
crime punishable with decapitation...

806
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:18,012
and married men never flirt.

807
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:23,017
Oh, I quite forgot that.

808
00:59:24,353 --> 00:59:28,814
Well, I - I suppose I may take it that
my dream of happiness is at an end.

809
00:59:29,942 --> 00:59:31,859
- Darling -
- Yes?

810
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:33,778
Oh.

811
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:35,947
I don't want to appear selfish...

812
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:38,908
and I love you with all my heart.

813
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:41,202
It makes a difference, doesn't it?

814
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:44,830
You see, burial alive - It's -

815
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:47,124
It's such a stuffy death.

816
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,169
I call it a beast of a death.

817
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:53,089
You see my difficulty, don't you?

818
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:54,382
Yes.

819
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:58,761
And I see my own. If I insist
on you carrying out your promise...

820
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,763
I doom you to a hideous death.

821
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,932
If I release you,
you marry Ko-Ko at once.

01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:37,711
The Mikado and his suite
are approaching the city -

867
01:02:37,796 --> 01:02:40,464
and will be here in 10 minutes.

868
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:42,007
- The Mikado?
- Mmm.

869
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:44,135
He's coming to see
if his orders have been carried out.

870
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:47,513
Oh, I can't live without Yum-Yum. This
afternoon I perform the happy dispatch.

871
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:50,975
Now look here, you know. This is
getting serious. A bargain's a bargain.

872
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:54,186
As a man of honor and a gentleman,
you are bound to die ignominiously...

873
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:56,772
at the hands of the
public executioner.

874
01:02:56,857 --> 01:02:58,566
Very well then.

875
01:02:59,151 --> 01:03:00,818
- Behead me.
- Ooh!

876
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,945
What? Now?

877
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:05,656
Certainly. At once.

878
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:08,701
Chop it off, Ko-Ko. Chop it off.

879
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:20,838
I don't go about prepared to execute
gentlemen at a moment's notice.

880
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,506
Oh!

881
01:03:22,591 --> 01:03:25,176
Why, I never even killed a bluebottle.

882
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:29,013
Oh, come, my poor fellow. After
all, if I don't mind, why should you?

883
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:31,223
Remember.
Sooner or later, it must be done.

884
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:33,934
Must it?

885
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:35,936
I'm not so sure about that.

886
01:03:36,021 --> 01:03:37,980
What do you mean?

887
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:40,502
Why should I kill you
when making an affidavit...

888
01:03:40,503 --> 01:03:42,903
...that you've been executed
will do just as well?

889
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:45,779
Here are plenty of witnesses
the lord chief justice...

890
01:03:45,864 --> 01:03:47,449
...the lord high admiral,
commander-in-chief,

891
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:48,950
...secretary of state for
the Home Department...

892
01:03:49,034 --> 01:03:52,036
first lord of the treasury and
the chief commissioner of police.

893
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,079
- Where are they?
- There they are.

894
01:03:54,915 --> 01:03:57,208
They'll all swear to it. Won't you?

895
01:03:57,292 --> 01:04:00,711
Am I to understand that all
of us high officers of state...

896
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:05,424
are required to perjure ourselves
to ensure your safety?

897
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:08,219
Why not? You'll be grossly
insulted, as usual.

898
01:04:08,303 --> 01:04:11,263
Will the insult be cash down
or at a date?

899
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:13,307
It will be a ready
money transaction.

900
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:15,643
Oh.

901
01:04:16,228 --> 01:04:17,686
Very good.

902
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:22,399
Choose your fiction,
and I'll endorse it.

903
01:04:22,484 --> 01:04:23,859
Ha-ha!

904
01:04:23,944 --> 01:04:25,444
Family pride.

905
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:28,072
How do you like that, me buck?

906
01:04:28,156 --> 01:04:29,990
But I tell you that
life without Yum-Yum -

907
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:32,076
Oh, Yum-Yum, Yum-Yum.
Bother Yum-Yum!

908
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:36,413
Take Yum-Yum, and marry Yum-Yum. Only
go away and never come back anymore.

909
01:04:36,498 --> 01:04:39,083
- Yum-Yum, are you
particularly busy? - No.

910
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:41,585
Then go along with His Grace,
the archbishop of Titipu.

911
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:44,088
- He'll marry you at once.
- But if I'm to be buried alive -

912
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:46,715
Don't ask any questions!
Do as I tell you.

913
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,927
- Oh, but one moment. You... - Not for
worlds. If the Mikado finds you alive...

914
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:52,763
I shall have the greatest difficulty
in persuading him I've beheaded you.

915
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:55,224

All this is very interesting,
and I should like to have seen it.

1053
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:11,154
But we came about a
totally different matter.

1054
01:14:11,239 --> 01:14:15,659
A year ago, my son, the heir to the throne
of Japan, bolted from our imperial court.

1055
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:16,993
Indeed?

1056
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:19,996
Had he any reason to be dissatisfied
with his position?

1057
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:23,750
None whatever. On the contrary,
I was going to marry him.

1058
01:14:24,335 --> 01:14:26,670
And yet he fled.

1059
01:14:26,754 --> 01:14:31,383
I am surprised that he should
have fled from one so lovely.

1060
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,135
That's not true.

1061
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:34,678
No.

1062
01:14:34,762 --> 01:14:39,307
He's now masquerading in this town,
disguised as a second trombone.

1063
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:40,600
A second trombone!

1064
01:14:40,685 --> 01:14:44,104
Yes. Would it be troubling you too
much if I asked you to produce him?

1065
01:14:44,188 --> 01:14:46,773
He goes by the name of, uh - of, uh -

1066
01:14:46,858 --> 01:14:49,317
- Nanki-Poo.
- Nanki-Poo.

1067
01:14:49,402 --> 01:14:51,111
Nanki-Poo?

1068
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:56,158
Oh, not at all.
It's quite easy. Uh -

1069
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:58,535
Th-That is, it's rather difficult.

1070
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:01,663
In point of fact, he's gone abroad.

1071
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:04,541
Gone abroad?

1072
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:08,920
See here! His name!
Nanki-Poo - beheaded this morning.

1073
01:15:09,005 --> 01:15:12,883
Oh, where shall I find another?

1074
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:17,053
Where shall I find another?

1075
01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:25,729
Dear, dear, dear.
This is very tiresome.

1076
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:28,982
My poor fellow, in your anxiety
to carry out my wishes...

1077
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:31,526
you've beheaded
the heir to the throne of Japan.

1078
01:15:31,611 --> 01:15:33,820
I beg to offer an unqualified apology.

1079
01:15:33,905 --> 01:15:37,490
I desire to associate myself
with that expression of regret.

1080
01:15:37,575 --> 01:15:39,576
We really hadn't the least notion.

1081
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:42,078
Of course you hadn't.
How could you?

1082
01:15:42,163 --> 01:15:46,166
If a man of exalted rank chooses
to disguise himself as a second trombone...

1083
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:48,084
he must take the consequences.

1084
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:50,962
I've no doubt he thoroughly
deserved all he got.

1085
01:15:51,756 --> 01:15:53,882
We are infinitely
obliged to Your Majesty.

1086
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:55,675
Much obliged, Your Majesty.

1087
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,761
Very much obliged, Your Majesty.

1088
01:15:57,845 --> 01:16:01,723
Obliged? Not a bit. Don't mention it.
How could you tell?

1089
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:04,476
No. Of course we couldn't tell
who the gentleman really was.

1090
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,686
It wasn't written on his forehead,
you know.

1091
01:16:06,771 --> 01:16:08,897
It might have been
on his pocket handkerchief...

1092
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:11,900
but Japanese don't use
pocket handkerchiefs.

1093
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:24,412
I forget the punishment for compassing
the death of the heir apparent.

1094
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:26,790
"Punishment."

1095
01:16:26,874 --> 01:16:29,000
Hmm. Yes. Uh -

1096
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:30,835
Uh -

1097
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:35,006
Something lingering,
with boiling oil in it, I fancy.

1098
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:37,175
Something of that sort.

1099
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:40,345
I think boiling oil occurs in it,
but I'm not sure.

1100
01:16:41,806 --> 01:16:45,308
And I know it's something
humorous, but lingering -

1101
01:16:45,393 --> 01:16:50,146
with either boiling oil
or melted lead.

1102
01:16:51,816 --> 01:16:55,151
Come, come.
Don't fret. I'm not a bit angry.

1103
01:16:55,236 --> 01:16:59,239
If Your Majesty will accept our
assurance, we had no idea -

1104
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:01,491
- Of course.
- I knew nothing about it.

1105
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:03,535
I wasn't there.

1106
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:07,038
Unfortunately, the fool of an act says
"compassing the death of the heir apparent."

1107
01:17:07,123 --> 01:17:08,123
Yes.

1108
01:17:08,207 --> 01:17:10,834
- There's not a word in it
about a mistake. - No.

1109
01:17:10,918 --> 01:17:12,919
- Or not knowing.
- No!

1110
01:17:13,004 --> 01:17:15,046
- Or having no notion.
- No.

1111
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:17,882
- Or not being there.
- No.

1112
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:20,176
- There should be, of course.
- Yes.

1113
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:22,887
But there isn't.

1114
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:26,433
That's the slovenly way
these acts are always drawn.

1115
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:30,353
Now, let's see.
About your execution -

1116
01:17:30,438 --> 01:17:32,522
Would after luncheon suit you?

1117
01:17:33,774 --> 01:17:36,109
Can you wait till then?

1118
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:39,612
Oh, yes. We can wait till then.

1119
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:43,658
Very well then.
We'll make it tomorrow, after luncheon.

1120
01:17:43,743 --> 01:17:46,619
Um, I shan't want any lunch.

1121
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:54,377
Well! And a nice mess
you've got us into...

1122
01:17:54,462 --> 01:17:57,547
with your nodding head and "the
deference due to a man of pedigree."

1123
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:01,051
Merely corroborative detail,
intended to give artistic verisimilitude...

1124
01:18:01,135 --> 01:18:04,220
to an otherwise bald
and unconvincing narrative.

1125
01:18:04,305 --> 01:18:07,307
Corroborative detail indeed.
Corroborative fiddlestick.

1126
01:18:07,391 --> 01:18:09,309
Oh, you're just as bad as he is...

1127
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:12,729
with your cock-and-a-bull story about
catching his eye and whistling an air.

1128
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:16,399
But that's so like you.
You must put in your oar.

1129
01:18:16,484 --> 01:18:18,943
But how about your big right arm?

1130
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:22,113
Yes. And your snickersnee.

1131
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:24,991
Yeah. Well, well -
Well, never mind about that now.

1132
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:28,411
There's only one thing to be done.

1133
01:18:28,496 --> 01:18:32,874
Nanki-Poo hasn't started yet.
He must come to life again at once.

1134
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:40,632
Nanki-Poo! Nanki-Poo!

1135
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:43,510
- I'm a dead man, and I'm off
for my honeymoon. - Oh, wait, wait.

1136
01:18:43,594 --> 01:18:46,596
Nanki-Poo! Nanki-Poo!
I've good news for you.

1137
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:49,432
- You're reprieved.
- Oh, but it's too late.

1138
01:18:50,851 --> 01:18:53,603
Nonsense.
A terrible thing has just happened.

1139
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:56,815
It seems that you are
the son of the Mikado.

1140
01:18:56,899 --> 01:19:00,151
Oh, but that happened some time ago.

1141
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:02,862
Is this a time for airy persiflage?

1142
01:19:02,947 --> 01:19:05,031
Your father is here -
and with Katisha.

1143
01:19:05,116 --> 01:19:08,660
- My father? And with Katisha?
- Yes. He wants you particularly.

1144
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:11,121
Oh! So does she.

1145
01:19:11,205 --> 01:19:14,416
- But he's married now. - Bless me
heart. What has that got to do with it?

1146
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:17,043
Well, Katisha claims me in
marriage, but I'm married already.

1147
01:19:17,128 --> 01:19:21,339
Consequently, she'll insist on my execution,
and my wife will have to be buried alive.

1148
01:19:21,424 --> 01:19:23,383
I don't know what's to be done.

1149
01:19:24,468 --> 01:19:27,470
There's one chance for you. If you
can persuade Katisha to marry you -

1150
01:19:31,434 --> 01:19:33,643
Ah, but wait.

1151
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:36,563
I can then come to life without
any fear of being put to death.

1152
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:38,982
I marry Katisha?

1153
01:19:39,066 --> 01:19:41,067
I really think it's the only course.

1154
01:19:41,152 --> 01:19:43,862
But, my good girl...

1155
01:19:43,946 --> 01:19:45,864
have you seen her?

1156
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:48,450
She's something appalling.

1157
01:19:48,534 --> 01:19:52,829
Well, it comes to this: While Katisha is
single, I prefer to be a disembodied spirit.

1158
01:19:52,913 --> 01:19:56,875
When Katisha is married, existence

Katisha.

1197
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:23,605
The miscreant who robbed me
of my love.

1198
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:26,482
But vengeance pursues.

1199
01:22:26,567 --> 01:22:29,360
They are heating the cauldron.

1200
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:46,878
Katisha, behold a suppliant
at your feet.

1201
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:48,921
Katisha, mercy.

1202
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:50,423
Mercy?

1203
01:22:50,507 --> 01:22:53,968
Had you mercy on him?

1204
01:22:54,053 --> 01:22:56,971
You have slain my love.

1205
01:22:57,056 --> 01:23:00,642
Well, he is dead,
and where shall I find another?

1206
01:23:00,726 --> 01:23:04,687
It takes years to train
a man to love me.

1207
01:23:05,272 --> 01:23:10,360
Where shall I find another?

1208
01:23:14,365 --> 01:23:15,865
Here.

1209
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:18,034
Here!

1210
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:20,119
What?

1211
01:23:20,204 --> 01:23:25,083
Katisha, for years I have loved
you with a white-hot passion...

1212
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:29,671
which is slowly but surely
consuming my very vitals!

1213
01:23:34,093 --> 01:23:37,887
Ah, shrink not from me.

1214
01:23:42,476 --> 01:23:44,143
Kat -

1215
01:23:45,646 --> 01:23:49,524
Katisha, I dare not
hope for your love...

1216
01:23:49,608 --> 01:23:51,734
but I will not live without it.

1217
01:23:51,819 --> 01:23:53,528
Darling!

1218
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:57,490
You! You, whose hands still reek
with the blood of my betrothed...

1219
01:23:57,574 --> 01:24:01,869
dare to address words of passion to
the woman you have so foully wronged?

1220
01:24:01,954 --> 01:24:06,958
I do. Accept my love,
or I perish on the spot!

1221
01:24:13,006 --> 01:24:14,924
Go to!

1222
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:19,971
Who knows so well as I that no one
ever yet died of a broken heart.

1223

and we're quite ready.

1260

Have all the painful
preparations been made?

1261
01:27:20,611 --> 01:27:22,528
Your Majesty, all is prepared.

1262
01:27:22,613 --> 01:27:24,780
Then produce the
unfortunate gentleman...

1263
01:27:24,865 --> 01:27:28,784
and his two well-meaning
but misguided accomplices.

1264
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:53,893
Mercy for Ko-Ko.
Mercy for Pitti-Sing.

Mercy even for Pooh-Bah.

1266
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:58,648
I beg your pardon. I don't think
I quite caught that remark.

1267
01:27:58,732 --> 01:28:00,858
Mercy even for Pooh-Bah.

1268
01:28:02,903 --> 01:28:04,987
My husband that was
to have been is dead...

1269
01:28:05,072 --> 01:28:08,616
and I have just married
this, uh, miserable object.

1270
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:14,914
Oh. You've not been long about it.

1271
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:18,334
No. We were married
before the registrar.

1272
01:28:18,418 --> 01:28:20,586
I am the registrar.

1273
01:28:20,671 --> 01:28:21,837
I see.

1274
01:28:21,922 --> 01:28:26,092
But my difficulty is that, as
you have slain the heir apparent -

1275
01:28:39,690 --> 01:28:43,567
- The heir apparent is not slain.
- Bless my heart. My son!

1276
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:46,445
And your daughter-in-law-elected.

1277
01:28:46,530 --> 01:28:49,407
Traitor! You have deceived me!

1278
01:28:49,491 --> 01:28:52,326
Yes. You are entitled to
a little explanation...

1279
01:28:52,411 --> 01:28:55,830
but I think he'll give it better whole
than in pieces.

1280
01:28:57,958 --> 01:29:02,503
Your Majesty, it's quite true that
I stated that I had killed Nanki-Poo.

1281
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:05,089
Yes, with most affecting particulars.

1282
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:07,216
It's like this, Your Majesty:

1283
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:09,385
When your Majesty says,
"Let a thing be done"...

1284
01:29:09,469 --> 01:29:12,138
that thing is as good as done -
practically, it is done -

1285
01:29:12,222 --> 01:29:14,557
because Your Majesty's will is law.

1286
01:29:14,641 --> 01:29:16,809
Your Majesty says,
"Kill a gentleman" -

1287
01:29:16,893 --> 01:29:19,562
Well, a gentleman is
told off to be killed.

1288
01:29:19,646 --> 01:29:22,064
Consequently,
that gentleman is as good as dead -

1289
01:29:22,149 --> 01:29:24,692
practically, he is dead.

1290
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:28,738
Well, if he is dead,
why not say so?

1291
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:33,159

be more satisfactory.
