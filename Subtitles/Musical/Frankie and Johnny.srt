# Come along

00:00:24,072 --> 00:00:25,073
# Come along

3
00:00:25,198 --> 00:00:29,536

# Come along

# We're gonna hit St Louis tonight

7
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,632
# Spend your money

8
00:00:41,757 --> 00:00:44,093
# Lookin' at the chorus line

9
00:00:44,218 --> 00:00:46,095
# Spend your money

10
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,681
# Win it on the number nine

11
00:00:48,806 --> 00:00:50,474
# Take your sweetheart

12
00:00:50,599 --> 00:00:52,935
# Even though she's never been

13
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,979
# If she's worried

14
00:00:55,104 --> 00:00:57,565
# Tell her that you always win

15
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,569
# Come along

16
00:01:01,777 --> 00:01:02,987
# Come along

17
00:01:03,112 --> 00:01:07,450
# There's a full moon shinin' bright

00:01:08,576 --> 00:01:10,495
# Come along

00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:11,954
# Come along

20
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,376
# You're gonna win a fortune tonight

21
00:01:17,585 --> 00:01:19,545
# Hear the whistle

22
00:01:19,671 --> 00:01:22,090
# Lady Luck's about to go

23
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,008
# Is she smiling?

24
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:26,511
# Maybe yes or maybe no

25
00:01:26,636 --> 00:01:28,388
# Now's the time when

26
00:01:28,513 --> 00:01:31,057
# Nights are filled with sweet romance

27
00:01:31,182 --> 00:01:33,059
# Don't be bashful

28
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:35,520
# Step on up and take a chance

29
00:01:37,772 --> 00:01:39,691
# Come along

30
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,109
# Come along

31
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:45,572
# There's a full moon shinin' bright

32
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,700
# Come along

33
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:49,951
# Come along

34
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:55,541
# We're gonna hit St Louis tonight

35
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,543
# Come along

36
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:58,752
# Come along

37
00:01:58,877 --> 00:02:03,006
# You're gonna win a fortune tonight

38
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:15,102
Boss, they just stopped a customer
from betting a roll of these. Why?

39
00:02:15,227 --> 00:02:19,440
- Why? Because it's Confederate money.
- Money's money, ain't it?

40
00:02:19,565 --> 00:02:22,985
Blackie, I don't know
what I'd do without you.

41
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,154
- You'd manage.
- Thanks.

42
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:29,742
Escort the gentleman gently to the deck.
Then kick him down the gangplank.

43
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:32,537
No more bets.

44
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:38,251
- Seen Johnny? It's nearly showtime.
- He made his daily bet. He went thataway.

45
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:43,214
- The rabbit's foot didn't help?
- Help? He lost that too.

46
00:02:45,258 --> 00:02:47,010
OK. New shoot. Come on out.

47
00:02:50,388 --> 00:02:51,598
Johnny?

48
00:02:51,723 --> 00:02:55,477
12 straight times he drew cards to 12,
on account of today is the 12th.

49
00:02:55,602 --> 00:02:59,314
- He didn't even win once?
- With me dealing?

50
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:04,027
- Hey, piano player.
- Yes, Mr Braden?

51
00:03:04,152 --> 00:03:07,447
- Tonight, play the notes as written.
- I'll use both hands.

52
00:03:07,572 --> 00:03:11,034
And if Johnny is late again,
I hope he can dance with a broken leg.

53
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:15,122
That's what I like about you, Boss.
Always ready with a pat on the back.

54
00:03:15,247 --> 00:03:17,166
Place your bets!

55
00:03:18,417 --> 00:03:21,920
- You seen Johnny?
- Look under the nearest pair of dice.

56
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:25,841
- Don't you even say hello to your wife?
- Hello, Wife.

57
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:29,845
Peg, how can I get Johnny
to give up gambling?

58
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:35,476
Easy. A bullet in the head, poison in his
coffee, a fatal knife wound. Nothin' to it.

59
00:03:36,227 --> 00:03:39,105
Where were you?
I lost you at the blackjack table.

60
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:43,776
A guy told me about a gypsy fortune-teller.
She's got a hot cup of tea leaves.

61
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:46,445
I'm a coffee man, myself.

62
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:50,658
What became of your astrologer? She
couldn't read the stars on a cloudy night?

63
00:03:50,783 --> 00:03:53,286
- You gotta have faith, Cully.
- And money.

64
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:55,955
- What did you lose tonight?
- How much did I have?

65
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,542
That's what you lost last night.
You're holding your own.

66
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,508
Seven years' bad luck.

67
00:04:07,342 --> 00:04:10,178
- It was already cracked.
- OK. Only five.

68
00:04:10,303 --> 00:04:13,264
- Be over before you know it.
- Aw...

69
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:17,602
Hey, five. That's a hunch.
Loan me five bucks.

70
00:04:17,727 --> 00:04:20,522
- I can't afford you.
- Put the five on number five.

71
00:04:20,647 --> 00:04:24,568
- I'll lose my job if I'm late.
- I'll lose confidence if I pass up a hunch.

72
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,959
Hello, Johnny.

73
00:04:41,293 --> 00:04:43,337
Hello, Johnny.

74
00:04:43,462 --> 00:04:45,506
Say goodbye, Johnny.

75
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:50,010
They're wearing mittens out there tonight.

76
00:04:50,135 --> 00:04:53,472
- They just don't appreciate talent.
- No.

77
00:04:53,597 --> 00:04:55,641
Onstage for "Petunia".

78
00:04:55,766 --> 00:04:59,270
- Always brings me luck.
- You need a new horseshoe.

79
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:14,160
# I've got a gal

80
00:05:14,285 --> 00:05:16,579
# Oh, what a pal

81
00:05:16,704 --> 00:05:19,582
# The apple of my eye

82
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:23,169
# We're something rare

83
00:05:23,294 --> 00:05:26,130
# A peach of a pair

84
00:05:26,256 --> 00:05:28,550
# But her dad won't let us meet

85
00:05:28,675 --> 00:05:32,387
# And I could die

86
00:05:32,512 --> 00:05:39,269
# I love Petunia the gardener's daughter

87
00:05:39,394 --> 00:05:42,772
# Ooh, how that gal can kiss

88
00:05:42,898 --> 00:05:46,860
# My eyes are blue as bluebells,
each cheek a rose to see

89
00:05:46,985 --> 00:05:51,031
# How I dance when she plants
her two lips on me

90
00:05:51,156 --> 00:05:54,493
# He's as daffy as a daffodil

91
00:05:54,618 --> 00:05:57,788
# He loves to kiss me all the time

92
00:05:57,913 --> 00:06:02,126
# Tonight I'll steal into her garden

93
00:06:02,251 --> 00:06:05,963
# And make Petunia's two lips mine

94
00:06:27,026 --> 00:06:30,196
# She makes other girls
look just like weeds

95
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:33,699
# I wanna be his clinging vine

96
00:06:33,825 --> 00:06:38,246
# Tonight I'll steal into her garden

97
00:06:38,371 --> 00:06:41,457
# And make Petunia's two lips

98
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:45,503
# My ever-lovin' two lips

99
00:06:46,421 --> 00:06:52,844
# Make Petunia's two lips mine

100
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:16,702
- What were those signals?
- What signals?

101
00:07:16,827 --> 00:07:19,997
- Between you and Cully. I'm not blind.
- Oh, those signals.

102
00:07:20,122 --> 00:07:24,501
- He just made a little bet for me.
- Can't you lose fast enough alone?

103
00:07:29,506 --> 00:07:32,676
- Where are you going?
- To have my head examined.

104
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:35,346
You can't help it if you're in love.

105
00:07:35,471 --> 00:07:37,890
You're born losers, both of you!

106
00:07:38,015 --> 00:07:42,853
- What's the matter with her?
- She's crazy about the wrong guy: Me.

107
00:07:42,978 --> 00:07:45,231
I am a loser.

108
00:07:45,356 --> 00:07:48,442
But, if I had 20 bucks, I could be a winner.

109
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:51,028
I hate myself for asking, but how?

110
00:07:51,154 --> 00:07:56,242
This gypsy fortune-teller, everybody
who takes her advice is hittin' it rich.

111
00:07:56,367 --> 00:08:01,456
- So how come she lives in a wagon?
- It's loaded with gold. You got 20 bucks?

112
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,750
Lucky for you, it just so happens...

113
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:07,045
You are the lowest person that ever lived.

114
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,716
- Peg, my sweetheart, you've missed me.
- You're not what I've missed.

115
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:13,593
- No?
- No!

116
00:08:13,718 --> 00:08:18,306
I've missed the $50
I hid in my winter lingerie.

117
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,976
I never could keep out of your...

118
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:24,563
Ow! Oh! You didn't have to stab me.

119
00:08:24,688 --> 00:08:28,650
I should've listened to my mother.
She said you were just like my father.

120
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:30,819
I could never drink that much.

121
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:35,908
Don't you dare say one word
about my drunken old man.

122
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:39,328
- Where's the money?
- I lost it, Peg, all of it. Honest.

123
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:43,040
- He loaned me the last five dollars.
- You stay out of this.

124
00:08:43,165 --> 00:08:45,209
Convince me. Take off your shoes.

125
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:47,419
- My shoes?!
- Off!

126
00:08:47,544 --> 00:08:52,216
Love and trust -
that's what makes a marriage great.

127
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:56,846
See? I could never lie to you.

128
00:08:58,013 --> 00:09:00,516
Well, there's a $10 lie.

129
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:04,145
- Now, how did that get in there?
- I wonder

130
00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:11,360
Goodbye, gypsy.

131
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,542
Hello, Zolita!

132
00:09:33,258 --> 00:09:35,385
Business is awful.

133
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,055
Why don't you have a talk
with your crystal ball?

134
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,391
Maybe these are two live ones.

135
00:09:46,605 --> 00:09:52,027
What shall I promise them?
A long journey or sudden wealth?

136
00:09:52,152 --> 00:09:56,156
As long as it costs you nothing,
give them both.

137
00:09:58,242 --> 00:10:01,411
Ah, gentlemen!
You have come to the right place.

138
00:10:01,537 --> 00:10:04,123
The one, the only, the incomparable...

139
00:10:04,248 --> 00:10:06,291
Zolita.

140
00:10:07,084 --> 00:10:12,256
The kid's got problems. Keeps breakin'
mirrors and walkin' under black cats.

141
00:10:12,381 --> 00:10:14,550
Yes, my son.

142
00:10:14,675 --> 00:10:17,970
You look troubled - deeply troubled.

143
00:10:18,095 --> 00:10:21,599
It's worse than that.
I can't break my losing streak.

144
00:10:21,724 --> 00:10:25,102
- Oh, you are a gambling man.
- Every cent I make.

145
00:10:25,227 --> 00:10:28,147
I could sure use some motherly advice.

146
00:10:28,272 --> 00:10:32,860
Mother Zolita can only interpret, my son.

147
00:10:32,985 --> 00:10:37,198
Perhaps the tea leaves
will forecast failure, perhaps success.

148
00:10:37,323 --> 00:10:42,287
I am merely a princess with a rare gift,

149
00:10:42,412 --> 00:10:45,540
handed down
from generation to generation.

150
00:10:45,665 --> 00:10:51,129
- Didn't I tell you she was great?
- She hasn't said anything yet.

151
00:10:52,422 --> 00:10:54,966
The leaves are ready to speak.

152
00:11:06,353 --> 00:11:08,397
No lemon?

153
00:11:11,983 --> 00:11:14,569
The tea leaves have spoken.

154
00:11:14,695 --> 00:11:17,823
If you do not mind! I work alone.

155
00:11:23,912 --> 00:11:25,998
What do they spell, mother?

156
00:11:26,123 --> 00:11:31,462
How lucky you are! The wheel of fortune
has stopped at your number.

157
00:11:31,587 --> 00:11:35,216
- Wheel? That's roulette.
- And I see a dice table too.

158
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:38,052
No blackjack? This boy plays all games.

159
00:11:38,177 --> 00:11:41,680
And a new woman
is coming into your life.

160
00:11:41,806 --> 00:11:45,101
A beautiful young redhead.

161
00:11:45,226 --> 00:11:50,147
It can't be a redhead, princess.
My girl's a blonde. Take another look.

162
00:11:50,273 --> 00:11:52,441
Now I see a blonde.

163
00:11:52,567 --> 00:11:55,111
Oh, but she has been bad luck for you.

164
00:11:55,236 --> 00:11:59,365
The tea leaves say
you will have good luck with the redhead.

165
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:03,828
I know better. I married one. Take
the advice of a 20-year loser: No redheads!

166
00:12:03,953 --> 00:12:06,664
He must not defy the tea leaves.

167
00:12:06,789 --> 00:12:11,294
- How will you explain her to Frankie?
- We'll just use her to make a bundle.

168
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:15,882
You're gonna pass off a beautiful redhead
as a good-luck piece? Good luck!

169
00:12:16,883 --> 00:12:20,387
- If I may be so crude...
- Oh, sure.

170
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:27,853
Please. The princess never
soils her royal hands with money.

171
00:12:27,978 --> 00:12:35,319
Ten dollars? When the tea leaves promise
a beautiful redhead, it is twenty dollars.

172
00:12:35,444 --> 00:12:38,322
It's a lot of money for a cup of tea.

173
00:12:39,281 --> 00:12:42,868
That's a gypsy. Takes all your dough
so you can't take her advice.

174
00:12:42,993 --> 00:12:47,331
Minor problems like that
I cannot solve.

175
00:12:47,456 --> 00:12:52,086
- Maybe Braden will give you an advance.
- I'm already in for five weeks' salary.

176
00:12:52,211 --> 00:12:56,799
That you lost right back into his pocket.
Braden's got a nice little thing goin' there.

177
00:12:56,924 --> 00:13:00,719
Ever know a gambler who couldn't
promote a little bettin' money?

178
00:13:00,845 --> 00:13:04,682
- You also need chesay.
- Chesay? Who's that?

179
00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:06,851
Chesay is gypsy good luck.

180
00:13:06,976 --> 00:13:09,020
Lazlo!

181
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:18,237
# Drink a cup of gypsy luck

182
00:13:18,362 --> 00:13:24,327
# Just keep it up
and then you just say "chesay"

183
00:13:24,452 --> 00:13:27,288
# Swallow once,
then swallow twice

184
00:13:27,413 --> 00:13:30,250
# Goes down so nice
Just say "chesay"

185
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,126
Hey!

186
00:13:31,251 --> 00:13:34,504
# What's in the drink
to chase the devil away?

187
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:36,089
# Lightning, I think

188
00:13:36,214 --> 00:13:37,799
# So just say "chesay"

189
00:13:37,924 --> 00:13:41,219
# Chesay, chesay
brings you good luck night and day

190
00:13:41,344 --> 00:13:44,723
# Chesay, chesay
That's the gypsy way

191
00:13:44,848 --> 00:13:47,934
# Trouble is my middle name
though it's such a crying shame

192
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:51,229
# I try and try
There's nothing I can do

193
00:13:51,355 --> 00:13:54,650
# But I'm feeling kinda strange
Feel like things are gonna change

194
00:13:54,775 --> 00:13:57,986
# Time my lucky star was shining through

195
00:13:58,111 --> 00:14:01,365
# Chesay, chesay
brings you good luck night and day

196
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:05,035
# Chesay, chesay
That's the gypsy way

197
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,621
# Drink a cup of gypsy luck

198
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:11,875
# Just tip it up and then
you just say "chesay"

199
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:14,503
# Swallow once,
then swallow twice

200
00:14:14,628 --> 00:14:17,339
# Goes down so nice
Just say "chesay"

201
00:14:17,464 --> 00:14:18,299
Hey!

202
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:21,635
# What's in the drink
to chase the devil away?

203
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:23,387
# Magic, I think

204
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:25,139
# So just say "chesay"

205
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:28,392
# Chesay, chesay
brings you good luck night and day

206
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:31,979
# Chesay, chesay
That's the gypsy way

207
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,982
# Chesay, chesay
brings you good luck night and day

208
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:38,069
# Chesay, chesay
That's the gypsy way

209
00:14:38,194 --> 00:14:40,947
# Chesay, chesay
brings you good luck night and day

210
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:43,616
# Chesay, chesay
That's the gypsy way

211
00:14:43,741 --> 00:14:44,867
Chesay!

212
00:14:46,536 --> 00:14:49,205
Have you seen Cully?
He's been missing for an hour.

213
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:53,209
- Have you tried the Lost and Found?
- No. I'm afraid they'll find him.

214
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:57,505
I always know where to find Johnny -
In the casino, losing his shirt.

215
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:02,636
Well, with the way the other girls look at
him, you're lucky he isn't playing around.

216
00:15:02,761 --> 00:15:05,305
Know what I'd do
if he ever did me wrong?

217
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,766
- Shoot yourself?
- No, him!

218
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,812
Bang, bang, bang!

219
00:15:15,774 --> 00:15:21,572
One last request before I cross
the great footlights up yonder.

220
00:15:21,697 --> 00:15:23,365
Like what?

221
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,660
Would you loan me 25 bucks
so I can pay Cully what I owe him?

222
00:15:26,785 --> 00:15:32,249
- Cully loaned you 25? Where'd he get it?
- Between my nightgown and petticoat.

223
00:15:32,374 --> 00:15:34,501
Do you know how much
you owe me already?

224
00:15:34,627 --> 00:15:36,378
Who's counting?

225
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:40,257
- You sure this money's not for gambling?
- Word of honour.

226
00:15:40,382 --> 00:15:42,426
And may you never kiss me again.

227
00:15:42,551 --> 00:15:45,763
He sounds sincere.
What would you do, Peg?

228
00:15:45,888 --> 00:15:50,017
What any woman with an ounce
of pride or self-respect would do:

229
00:15:50,142 --> 00:15:52,186
Give him the money.

230
00:16:00,194 --> 00:16:03,239
Greatest little bank in America.

231
00:16:03,364 --> 00:16:10,205
- Two greatest little banks in America.
- Shame you don't have an account there.

232
00:16:10,872 --> 00:16:13,249
Five... ten...

233
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:17,212
...fifteen... twenty... twenty-five.

234
00:16:17,337 --> 00:16:20,590
- That makes us even.
- I didn't think Frankie'd give you a dime.

235
00:16:20,715 --> 00:16:23,760
- What have you got left to play with?
- Oh, I'm broke.

236
00:16:23,885 --> 00:16:26,972
But I got a rich friend who will loan me...

237
00:16:27,097 --> 00:16:30,392
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five.

238
00:16:30,517 --> 00:16:34,146
- Better count it to be sure it's all there.
- What for? I trust you.

239
00:16:34,271 --> 00:16:37,566
Now all we need is a beautiful redhead.

240
00:16:42,321 --> 00:16:45,574
Nellie! Nellie Bly!

241
00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:47,868
Hello, Blackie.

242
00:16:47,993 --> 00:16:51,705
Hey, you look great!
How did New York treat you?

243
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:55,668
They didn't believe my billing:
"The Singing Queen of the Riverboats".

244
00:16:55,793 --> 00:16:59,088
- How's the action?
- The boss never had it rollin' in so fast.

245
00:16:59,213 --> 00:17:03,676
Money isn't everything, but it never
made a man look less attractive.

246
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:07,680
- Put those in my old room, Mac.
- Does Mr Braden know you're back?

247
00:17:07,805 --> 00:17:10,391
No. I want to surprise him.
Is he in his office?

248
00:17:10,516 --> 00:17:15,688
Don't surprise him now. Go in and win a
few bucks till he spruces up for you, huh?

249
00:17:15,813 --> 00:17:18,733
- Who is she?
- Oh, that's not nice.

250
00:17:18,858 --> 00:17:22,320
Has Mr Braden ever cheated on you?
Well, has he?

251
00:17:22,445 --> 00:17:24,489
Still protecting him, aren't you?

252
00:17:24,614 --> 00:17:27,533
Why not? Who baled me out
and got me a job?

253
00:17:27,659 --> 00:17:29,786
And who made a gentleman out of me?

254
00:17:29,911 --> 00:17:32,372
OK, OK. Go ring the fire bell.

255
00:17:32,497 --> 00:17:37,961
Tell Braden I'll meet him in the casino
after I pretty up for him.

256
00:17:41,506 --> 00:17:44,342
Are you really going to
make me a star, Mr Braden?

257
00:17:44,467 --> 00:17:47,762
It's not me that'll do it, Mitzi.
It's your talent.

258
00:17:47,888 --> 00:17:52,476
- I do have talent, don't I?
- You're loaded with it.

259
00:17:55,771 --> 00:18:01,360
Hey, Boss. You got one girl too many.
Nellie Bly just came aboard.

260
00:18:02,194 --> 00:18:05,280
When you've got a message
like that, whisper.

261
00:18:05,405 --> 00:18:09,910
Nellie's in the casino, waiting for you.
She doesn't know about you and Mitzi.

262
00:18:10,035 --> 00:18:15,040
It's happened to me again?
I don't get my name in lights?

263
00:18:15,165 --> 00:18:18,544
- You don't have the talent, Mitzi.
- But a minute ago you said...

264
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:22,840
The only woman who ever gave me
bubbles like that champagne is back.

265
00:18:22,965 --> 00:18:26,969
And she's funny.
She thinks three is a crowd.

266
00:18:27,094 --> 00:18:29,138
Why, you...!

267
00:18:31,057 --> 00:18:33,100
Ooh!

268
00:18:41,317 --> 00:18:43,152
Hi, Mitzi.

269
00:18:43,277 --> 00:18:45,321
The boss in a bad mood again?

270
00:18:45,446 --> 00:18:49,617
Bad? He never felt better.
His favourite girl came back.

271
00:18:49,742 --> 00:18:51,786
I thought you were.

272
00:18:51,911 --> 00:18:55,623
I just found out
I've been understudying the part.

273
00:18:55,749 --> 00:19:01,838
In my next life I hope I'm not a girl.
I could never go through that again.

274
00:19:03,757 --> 00:19:07,552
- 26, black, even.
- Let's try another table.

275
00:19:09,971 --> 00:19:14,267
- All blondes. I can't go against Zolita.
- You're too darned particular.

276
00:19:14,393 --> 00:19:18,897
- The gypsy said a beautiful redhead.
- Then we're wasting our time here.

277
00:19:19,022 --> 00:19:22,025
- Seven blondes. Not one redhead.
- Seven.

278
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:25,904
- That's a hunch bet if ever I heard one.
- I'll tell the gypsy on you.

279
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:28,282
- Place your bets.
- On seven.

280
00:19:29,324 --> 00:19:33,662
- Oh, no, lady! That's the kiss of death.
- I'm sorry.

281
00:19:33,787 --> 00:19:37,374
- Off seven.
- Hold it. Maybe that's your lucky redhead.

282
00:19:37,499 --> 00:19:40,336
- Are you?
- The action's over there.

283
00:19:40,461 --> 00:19:43,130
No more bets.

284
00:19:48,052 --> 00:19:51,222
Seven! A winner. Red.

285
00:19:51,347 --> 00:19:55,309
35 times 20...
You would've won 700 bucks!

286
00:19:55,434 --> 00:19:57,562
If she can do it once, she can do it again.

287
00:19:57,687 --> 00:20:00,231
- Are you a real redhead?
- I'm a real everything.

288
00:20:00,356 --> 00:20:03,401
- What's your lucky number?
- One. One at a time.

289
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:07,155
One it is. Would you mind
giving 'em your magic touch?

290
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,449
Just for luck.

291
00:20:09,574 --> 00:20:13,703
- You better get the bottom one too.
- Place your bets!

292
00:20:13,828 --> 00:20:16,915
By this time tomorrow,
this ship should be the SS Johnny.

293
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,417
- What's your name, Lucky?
- Nellie Bly.

294
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:21,878
- Welcome aboard.
- That's it! Bly!

295
00:20:22,003 --> 00:20:27,008
I need a name to rhyme with "eye" for
a song I'm writing. Now I got it. Nellie Bly!

296
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:30,262
- You'll be famous in a song.
- I've tried every other way.

297
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:37,853
I don't even have to look.
I know it's gonna be number one.

298
00:20:37,978 --> 00:20:40,439
One, red.

299
00:20:40,564 --> 00:20:44,067
- Maybe that gypsy knew something!
- Maybe? My future just got here!

300
00:20:44,193 --> 00:20:46,111
One hundred...

301
00:20:46,236 --> 00:20:48,280
- two hundred...
- Place your bets.

302
00:20:48,405 --> 00:20:50,741
...three hundred...
- It's the break I've been wait...

303
00:20:50,866 --> 00:20:53,577
...four hundred...
- Hey, where'd she go?

304
00:20:53,702 --> 00:20:56,497
- What about these chips?
- I'll be right back.

305
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:00,668
Nellie, it's been a long year.
You never looked better.

306
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:03,212
You have. Who's been
keeping you up nights?

307
00:21:03,337 --> 00:21:05,381
Who can remember names?

308
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:11,971
- What kind of a kiss is that?
- We are not starting where we left off.

309
00:21:12,096 --> 00:21:14,974
I like a girl who remembers
the good things in life.

310
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,401
I thought you came back
because you missed me.

311
00:21:25,526 --> 00:21:27,987
I wasn't good enough for Broadway.

312
00:21:28,112 --> 00:21:31,699
I'm big in the small time
and small in the big time.

313
00:21:31,825 --> 00:21:34,536
You'll always be my star attraction.

314
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:38,581
What about the girl last week?
And the girl before her and before her...

315
00:21:38,707 --> 00:21:42,168
- A man gets lonely.
- Lonely enough to get married?

316
00:21:42,294 --> 00:21:45,964
- Not marriage again?
- My mother recommends it highly.

317
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:48,633
Your mother doesn't know me.

318
00:21:48,758 --> 00:21:53,055
What would you do
if I got big eyes for someone else?

319
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,640
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

320
00:21:55,766 --> 00:22:00,479
I might arrange to have his neck broken.
But, outside of that, nothing.

321
00:22:00,604 --> 00:22:02,773
- Come here.
- Hey, Boss.

322
00:22:02,898 --> 00:22:04,900
A customer wants to raise the limit.

323
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:07,653
- How's he doing?
- Big loser.

324
00:22:07,778 --> 00:22:10,447
Losers we always accommodate.

325
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,035
Don't shuffle the cards. I'll be right back.

326
00:22:21,876 --> 00:22:24,628
- Hey, you can't do that to me.
- Hello again.

327
00:22:24,754 --> 00:22:26,797
- Do what?
- Disappear.

328
00:22:26,922 --> 00:22:30,885
You and I meeting tonight was
no accident. The gypsies sent you.

329
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:34,096
Gypsies? Who believes in them?

330
00:22:34,222 --> 00:22:38,851
I do. A fortune-teller told me a gorgeous
redhead would come into my life,

331
00:22:38,976 --> 00:22:41,187
the luckiest thing
that ever happened to me.

332
00:22:41,312 --> 00:22:44,816
- I'm a gorgeous rabbit's foot?
- You don't know how badly I need you.

333
00:22:44,941 --> 00:22:48,027
- Tell me more.
- Oh, hello, Boss.

334
00:22:49,487 --> 00:22:53,283
- I finally found my good-luck charm.
- Did you, now?

335
00:22:53,408 --> 00:22:56,494
I'll break every casino on the river
before I'm through.

336
00:22:56,619 --> 00:22:59,372
You're through now.
Didn't you tell him who you are?

337
00:22:59,497 --> 00:23:02,542
- I don't even know who he is.
- Allow me.

338
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:06,713
Johnny... my number one girl, Nellie Bly.

339
00:23:06,838 --> 00:23:09,841
How about that?
She means a lot to both of us.

340
00:23:09,966 --> 00:23:12,969
She's private stock -
all 120 pounds of her.

341
00:23:13,095 --> 00:23:14,805
118.

342
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,808
Weren't you due on stage
five minutes ago?

343
00:23:17,933 --> 00:23:19,351
Ten.

344
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:28,569
- Forget it, Nellie. He's spoken for.
- Yes, but I'm not.

345
00:23:28,694 --> 00:23:33,032
To show you how worried I am,
let's go hear lover boy sing.

346
00:23:33,991 --> 00:23:40,623
# Wise men have known
women can't live alone

347
00:23:41,415 --> 00:23:48,214
# So a woman should understand

348
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:52,843
# That what every woman lives for

349
00:23:53,177 --> 00:23:56,764
# What every woman lives for

350
00:23:56,889 --> 00:24:02,854
# Is to give her love to a man

351
00:24:05,106 --> 00:24:10,904
# He may not be the kind
you find in picture books

352
00:24:12,113 --> 00:24:19,037
# A real-life hero
with dashing handsome looks

353
00:24:20,538 --> 00:24:27,128
# He may not be the guy
that you've been dreaming of

354
00:24:27,254 --> 00:24:34,761
# But that won't stop you
from giving him your love

355
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:43,395
# So, dear, can't you see
that it was meant to be?

356
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:50,861
# It's part... part of our destiny

357
00:24:50,986 --> 00:24:54,990
# Cos what every woman lives for

358
00:24:55,282 --> 00:24:58,786
# What every woman lives for

359
00:24:58,911 --> 00:25:05,459
# Is to give her love to a man

360
00:25:06,794 --> 00:25:13,426
# And I hope that man is me

361
00:25:23,436 --> 00:25:26,522
Hey! Johnny likes her.

362
00:25:26,648 --> 00:25:32,946
Maybe it'll be one big happy triangle,
and I'll come out on the right side!

363
00:25:37,325 --> 00:25:41,663
What is this? You wouldn't talk to me
last night and won't today. What did I do?

364
00:25:41,788 --> 00:25:45,750
Who smiled at Nellie Bly last night
like she was the only girl in the world?

365
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:47,168
Who is she?

366
00:25:47,294 --> 00:25:49,921
- D'you really wanna know?
- I really wanna know.

367
00:25:50,046 --> 00:25:52,841
- Where do you think I got this?
- You robbed a bank.

368
00:25:52,966 --> 00:25:56,303
- 700 dollars, and I owe it all to her.
- You owe it all to me.

369
00:25:56,428 --> 00:25:59,473
I got nothin' but admiration
for a man who pays his debts.

370
00:25:59,598 --> 00:26:03,435
Now we're even,
give or take a few dollars.

371
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,980
- When I win, I lose.
- Who hates you up there?

372
00:26:07,105 --> 00:26:12,486
If you see her again - and my advice is:
Don't - thank Nellie Bly for me.

373
00:26:12,611 --> 00:26:14,738
Somebody page me?

374
00:26:14,863 --> 00:26:17,741
Anybody I haven't met yet, I'm Nellie Bly.

375
00:26:17,866 --> 00:26:21,245
I'm Mitzi. Last week's kisses.

376
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:24,165
You might
get him back on the rebound.

377
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,333
Rebound?

378
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:29,337
I'm the original rubber ball.

379
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:33,966
- Looks like Mitzi's got her hands full.
- Looks like you have.

380
00:26:34,091 --> 00:26:35,927
- Hello, everybody.
- Hello.

381
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:39,347
- I hear you wrote a new number.
- It's the one I told you about.

382
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:43,184
Frankie, this is Nellie.
Shake hands and come out fighting.

383
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:47,105
- I just might do that.
- Your claws are showing.

384
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,982
And they scratch.

385
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:52,777
- I hear you're Braden's girl, off and on.
- I'm nobody's girl.

386
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:55,113
Let's keep it that way.

387
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:58,241
Could we stop wasting time
and rehearse?

388
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,702
- You written lots of hits?
- A trunkful.

389
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:03,788
- Wait till Joe hears this one.
- Joe the deck hand?

390
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:07,751
Joe Wilbur, the music publisher
from New York. He'll be here next week.

391
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:11,546
It's money in the bank if he likes it.
Money you can keep.

392
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:14,174
- For how long?
- We own half the song.

393
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,010
On account of the title
- "Frankie and Johnny".

394
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,305
At least the billing is right.

395
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:24,393
Let's hear it, Stephen Foster.

396
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:27,813
# Frankie and Johnny were lovers

397
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:31,400
# Oh Lordy, how they could love

398
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:33,569
Uh... just play it.

399
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,992
# Frankie and Johnny were lovers

400
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:42,161
Time they got married.

401
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,873
# Oh Lordy, how they could love

402
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,042
Blabbermouth.

403
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,211
# Swore to be true to each other

404
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:59,220
# This story has no moral

405
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:01,305
# Hmmm

406
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:04,892
# This story has no end

407
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:07,312
# Hmmm

408
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:11,065
# This story only goes to show

409
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:15,028
# That there ain't no good in men

410
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:19,240
# They'll do you wrong

411
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:24,120
# Yes, they'll do you wrong

412
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:33,338
# Frankie and me, we are lovers

413
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:37,050
# Oh Lordy, how we can love

414
00:28:37,175 --> 00:28:40,262
# Swore to be true to each other

415
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:43,599
# Just as true as stars above

416
00:28:43,724 --> 00:28:46,894
# Frankie, I'm your man

417
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:50,105
# I'll never do you wrong

418
00:29:16,257 --> 00:29:19,427
# I knew that I was a winner

419
00:29:19,552 --> 00:29:23,222
# When a new gal caught my eye

420
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:26,476
# But I couldn't two-time Frankie

421
00:29:26,601 --> 00:29:30,104
# For that chick named Nellie Bly

422
00:29:30,229 --> 00:29:33,191
# I'm Frankie's man

423
00:29:33,316 --> 00:29:36,402
# I wouldn't do her wrong

424
00:29:39,072 --> 00:29:42,784
# Baby, leave me here to gamble

425
00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:46,621
# I'll be home before dawn

426
00:29:46,746 --> 00:29:49,249
# Don't wait up for me, honey

427
00:29:49,374 --> 00:29:52,544
# And don't you worry while I'm gone

428
00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:56,131
# Johnny, you're my man

429
00:29:56,256 --> 00:29:59,468
# Now, don't you do me wrong

430
00:30:05,557 --> 00:30:09,228
# Johnny, he wasn't too lucky

431
00:30:09,353 --> 00:30:13,357
# He was a loser that night

432
00:30:13,482 --> 00:30:16,360
# So he tried to change his luck

433
00:30:16,485 --> 00:30:19,154
# With a gal who wasn't right

434
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,033
# He's Frankie's man

435
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:26,871
# But he's doin' her wrong

436
00:31:05,952 --> 00:31:10,832
# Frankie,
I don't wanna make you no trouble

437
00:31:10,957 --> 00:31:14,586
# Honey, I don't wanna tell you no lie

438
00:31:14,711 --> 00:31:16,546
# But...

439
00:31:16,671 --> 00:31:19,633
# I saw your sweet man, Johnny

440
00:31:19,758 --> 00:31:24,096
# He was messin' round
with that Nellie Bly

441
00:31:24,221 --> 00:31:27,307
# Well, if he's your man

442
00:31:28,517 --> 00:31:31,603
# Then he's doin' you wrong

443
00:31:35,024 --> 00:31:38,652
# Frankie went back to find Johnny

444
00:31:38,777 --> 00:31:41,864
# But she wasn't lookin' for fun

445
00:31:43,032 --> 00:31:46,035
# In her sweet, dainty little hand

446
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,080
# She was totin' a 44 gun

447
00:31:49,205 --> 00:31:52,750
# To shoot her man

448
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:56,003
# Cos he was doin' her wrong

449
00:31:58,297 --> 00:32:01,926
# Frankie looked into the barroom

450
00:32:02,051 --> 00:32:05,888
# And right there, in front of her eyes

451
00:32:06,013 --> 00:32:09,183
# There was her sweet man, Johnny

452
00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:12,061
# Making love to that Nellie Bly

453
00:32:12,186 --> 00:32:15,732
# He was her man

454
00:32:15,857 --> 00:32:18,276
# She caught him doin' her wrong

455
00:32:19,444 --> 00:32:21,488
Johnny?

456
00:32:23,406 --> 00:32:26,701
# Frankie, I beg you, don't shoot me

457
00:32:26,826 --> 00:32:30,247
# They'll put you away in a cell

458
00:32:30,372 --> 00:32:33,166
# They'll put you
where the cold wind blows

459
00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:37,713
# From the hottest corner of hell

460
00:32:37,838 --> 00:32:41,967
# Johnny, you're my man

461
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:49,600
# But you're doin' me wrong

462
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,791
- Mr Wilbur...
- Shh.

463
00:33:15,835 --> 00:33:19,630
# He was her man

464
00:33:19,755 --> 00:33:27,889
# But he done her wrong

465
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:41,736
- Did I write a hit, Mr Wilbur?
- You know what's good about this song?

466
00:33:41,861 --> 00:33:43,488
- The words?
- The music?

467
00:33:43,613 --> 00:33:45,323
No. Them.

468
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:48,785
You ought to be on Broadway.

469
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:52,080
You didn't like the song?

470
00:33:52,205 --> 00:33:54,791
It's fine for their act.
I might even publish it.

471
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:58,211
But a hit? I know one when I hear it.

472
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:03,550
You're just saying that because
you don't want to give us an advance.

473
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:07,387
- Shut up, sweetheart.
- No advance, no song.

474
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:12,976
- Back in the trunk it goes.
- Nobody pushes me around. Forget it.

475
00:34:14,937 --> 00:34:18,315
- How big an advance?
- Talk to my business manager.

476
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,111
Well, now, Mr Wilbur! Um...

477
00:34:22,236 --> 00:34:24,822
- $300 and the song is yours.
- $100.

478
00:34:25,322 --> 00:34:32,538
- Oh. Let's just split the difference. $250.
- Let's not quibble about it. $200 it is.

479
00:34:33,331 --> 00:34:38,502
- Were you serious about Frankie and me?
- I've seen better, but not very often.

480
00:34:38,628 --> 00:34:41,047
- Isn't Johnny great?
- Isn't she wonderful?

481
00:34:41,172 --> 00:34:45,301
All you need is new costumes, new
arrangements and new special material.

482
00:34:45,426 --> 00:34:47,470
Here's my card.

483
00:34:48,471 --> 00:34:53,142
- Look me up when you get to New York.
- Thank you, Mr Wilbur.

484
00:34:53,268 --> 00:34:57,897
- We're on our way!
- Goodbye, riverboat! Hello, Broadway!

485
00:35:01,025 --> 00:35:03,737
# We never got discouraged

486
00:35:03,862 --> 00:35:06,239
# We never had a doubt

487
00:35:06,364 --> 00:35:08,742
# Cos sooner or later

488
00:35:08,867 --> 00:35:11,453
# Talent must win out

489
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:16,333
# Look out, Broadway, we're comin' fast

490
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:20,420
# Now we're gonna see
our names in lights at last

491
00:35:20,545 --> 00:35:24,341
# No more hot dogs at Sloppy Joe's

492
00:35:24,466 --> 00:35:28,428
# We're gonna dine on steak and wine
at Delmonico's

493
00:35:28,554 --> 00:35:32,433
# Rich or poor, it's great to have dough

494
00:35:32,558 --> 00:35:36,395
# That's one thing we know

495
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,357
# Lots of fun, lots of laughs

496
00:35:40,482 --> 00:35:44,111
# Signing cheques and contracts
and autographs

497
00:35:44,236 --> 00:35:48,115
# We're off for N-e-w Y-o-r-k

498
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,161
# Look out, look out, Broadway

499
00:35:52,286 --> 00:35:55,831
# I wanna see all the hustle and bustle

500
00:35:55,957 --> 00:35:59,752
# Maybe I can get a date
with Lillian Russell

501
00:35:59,877 --> 00:36:03,297
# I want to go out with Diamond Jim

502
00:36:03,422 --> 00:36:07,427
# Yeah, if he gives you a diamond
what will you give to him?

503
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:11,514
# Blow the trumpets and beat on the drum

504
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:15,727
# Big town, here we come

505
00:36:15,852 --> 00:36:19,522
# No more cheap hotels
and one-night stands

506
00:36:19,647 --> 00:36:23,276
# We'll knock Tin Pan Alley
flat on its pan

507
00:36:23,401 --> 00:36:27,364
# They'll see that we've got class
with a capital K

508
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:34,621
# Look out, look out, Broadway

509
00:36:34,746 --> 00:36:36,790
Look out!

510
00:36:37,541 --> 00:36:41,253
All we need is enough money
to get to New York - a lot more than 200.

511
00:36:41,378 --> 00:36:43,297
- Don't look at me.
- OK.

512
00:36:43,422 --> 00:36:46,758
I'll win it in the casino
with a beautiful redhead beside me.

513
00:36:46,884 --> 00:36:49,303
- If you mean Nellie...
- Nellie who?

514
00:36:49,428 --> 00:36:54,850
Just remember this:
If she's in, I'm out. Good night!

515
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,438
You would've hated New York anyway.

516
00:36:59,563 --> 00:37:02,066
We'll get there.

517
00:37:02,191 --> 00:37:05,277
Peg? Our half?

518
00:37:06,904 --> 00:37:09,782
Frankie's half of our half.

519
00:37:09,907 --> 00:37:12,451
Where's my half of our half?

520
00:37:14,745 --> 00:37:18,583
- Guess.
- What am I, a memory expert?

521
00:37:24,589 --> 00:37:29,344
I got a brand-new rabbit's foot,
a horseshoe from a Derby winner...

522
00:37:30,386 --> 00:37:33,097
and the lucky cricket Frankie gave me.

523
00:37:33,222 --> 00:37:37,185
Now all you need is a new lucky redhead,
and I know the perfect spot to find one.

524
00:37:42,357 --> 00:37:43,900
Blonde.

525
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,404
Another blonde.

526
00:37:51,616 --> 00:37:53,618
Brunette.

527
00:37:55,203 --> 00:37:57,247
Blonde.

528
00:38:03,754 --> 00:38:06,214
Heaven only knows.

529
00:38:10,135 --> 00:38:12,179
Brunette.

530
00:38:17,226 --> 00:38:20,145
Your guess is as good as mine.

531
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:24,483
Looks like somebody cornered the market
on redheads. Let's give up for tonight.

532
00:38:24,608 --> 00:38:27,111
With this money burning
a hole in my pocket? Nah.

533
00:38:27,236 --> 00:38:31,949
- We could trap a blonde and dye her red.
- I'm waitin' here for the real thing.

534
00:38:35,786 --> 00:38:37,830
Jackpot.

535
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:43,127
Watch the old master go to work.

536
00:38:45,171 --> 00:38:49,175
- Hello, Eloise!
- Hello, Charlie!

537
00:38:50,802 --> 00:38:54,013
Wait a minute.
You're not Charlie. You're Jack!

538
00:38:54,138 --> 00:39:00,186
- That's right, Eloise!
- Eloise? I thought you said Abigail.

539
00:39:00,311 --> 00:39:03,314
Pardon me, "old master".
Are you alone, Abigail?

540
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:09,237
Practically. Boyfriend passed out
about an hour ago. Can't hold his liquor.

541
00:39:09,362 --> 00:39:13,992
And he's letting a lovely lady like you
drift around by her little old lonesome?

542
00:39:14,117 --> 00:39:17,204
Who's lonesome? I got you two.

543
00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:19,372
Whoops.

544
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:27,297
She's no gentleman.

545
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:35,931
- Here we go!
- Place your bets.

546
00:39:36,056 --> 00:39:41,061
- What number do you like?
- 13. That's my lucky number.

547
00:39:41,186 --> 00:39:44,356
On account of I got 13 letters in my name.

548
00:39:44,481 --> 00:39:49,612
A- b-i-g-a-i-I. 13.

549
00:39:49,737 --> 00:39:53,032
Lady, you could stand
a few lessons in arithmetic.

550
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:57,787
- Does it have to be 13?
- If you don't bet 13, I'll cry.

551
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:02,083
No more bets!

552
00:40:12,635 --> 00:40:14,178
13, black!

553
00:40:14,304 --> 00:40:18,141
- Whee! Yippee!
- You did it! You did it!

554
00:40:18,266 --> 00:40:21,352
- What number do you like now?
- 13! I like 13!

555
00:40:21,478 --> 00:40:23,938
- Again?
- 13. Bet it all.

556
00:40:25,065 --> 00:40:27,108
Let it ride on 13.

557
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,584
13!

558
00:40:46,461 --> 00:40:48,964
- That gypsy knew something!
- Didn't I tell you?

559
00:40:49,089 --> 00:40:51,133
Let it ride! Let it ride!

560
00:40:51,258 --> 00:40:53,051
- Bet it all.
- All of it?

561
00:40:53,177 --> 00:40:59,058
- You can't hit 13 three times in a row.
- Don't tell me you're a cheapskate?

562
00:40:59,183 --> 00:41:01,226
The lady said let it ride. OK?

563
00:41:04,438 --> 00:41:06,482
The limit's off.

564
00:41:06,607 --> 00:41:09,735
- All of it goes on 13.
- No, no, no, no, no!

565
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,904
On 31.

566
00:41:12,988 --> 00:41:19,287
- Don't you mean 13?
- I don't like 13 any more. I am fickle.

567
00:41:19,412 --> 00:41:22,498
All right. All of it on 31.

568
00:41:25,543 --> 00:41:27,378
He could use a little help.

569
00:41:43,978 --> 00:41:46,439
The winner - 13!

570
00:41:58,034 --> 00:42:01,329
Abigail, don't just lie there.
Say something.

571
00:42:01,455 --> 00:42:04,541
Who moved the table?

572
00:42:22,393 --> 00:42:25,521
Frankie? Did I wake you?

573
00:42:25,646 --> 00:42:28,023
That's pretty sad music.

574
00:42:28,149 --> 00:42:31,068
Sad? It's a dirge.

575
00:42:31,193 --> 00:42:33,320
I almost won five thousand dollars.

576
00:42:33,446 --> 00:42:35,489
Five thousand?!

577
00:42:35,614 --> 00:42:38,200
Why didn't you quit
when you were ahead?

578
00:42:38,326 --> 00:42:42,955
- Ask me an easier question.
- All right, I will.

579
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:49,712
Why do I have to love a riverboat singer
whose life is one great big roulette wheel?

580
00:42:49,837 --> 00:42:51,798
Don't you ever win?

581
00:42:51,923 --> 00:42:56,678
That's two questions.
But I can only answer the second.

582
00:43:04,477 --> 00:43:08,606
# I wave no magic wand

583
00:43:10,358 --> 00:43:14,487
# I own no lucky charms

584
00:43:15,405 --> 00:43:19,534
# How then can I explain

585
00:43:20,577 --> 00:43:24,706
# An angel in my arms?

586
00:43:26,291 --> 00:43:30,420
# Must be beginner's luck

587
00:43:31,713 --> 00:43:35,843
# What else can it be

588
00:43:35,968 --> 00:43:43,225
# When someone
wonderful as you loves me?

589
00:43:48,397 --> 00:43:52,526
# I wave no magic wand

590
00:43:53,611 --> 00:43:57,740
# I own no lucky charms

591
00:43:58,783 --> 00:44:02,912
# How then can I explain

592
00:44:03,746 --> 00:44:07,875
# An angel in my arms?

593
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:13,589
# Must be beginner's luck

594
00:44:14,841 --> 00:44:20,138
# What else can it be

595
00:44:20,263 --> 00:44:28,563
# When someone
wonderful as you loves me?

596
00:44:58,218 --> 00:45:01,347
Aren't you rehearsing?
We're an hour from New Orleans.

597
00:45:01,472 --> 00:45:04,099
And less than 24 hours from being rich.

598
00:45:04,224 --> 00:45:08,687
I'm dead broke. Peg went through
my pants last night - with me in 'em!

599
00:45:08,812 --> 00:45:11,398
- I don't need any money from you.
- You don't?

600
00:45:11,524 --> 00:45:14,777
Braden gave me an advance.
If I can just get Nellie to meet me...

601
00:45:14,902 --> 00:45:17,405
- Nellie?
- She's the right redhead, Cully.

602
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:20,116
- I can win with her.
- You can get your head broken.

603
00:45:20,241 --> 00:45:23,160
Frankie and I belong in the big time.

604
00:45:23,286 --> 00:45:26,497
Frankie told you to keep away from Nellie.

605
00:45:26,622 --> 00:45:31,294
Just one hot spin of the wheel
is all I need, with Nellie beside me.

606
00:45:31,419 --> 00:45:34,505
I'll come visit you in the hospital.

607
00:45:40,887 --> 00:45:42,639
# Down by the riverside

608
00:45:42,889 --> 00:45:46,893
# Down by the riverside

609
00:45:47,018 --> 00:45:49,521
# We'll hear them play and keep that beat

610
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:51,564
# Down by the riverside

611
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:53,775
# Down by the riverside

612
00:45:54,025 --> 00:45:55,527
# Down by the riverside

613
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:58,238
# Let's get together, what a treat

614
00:45:58,363 --> 00:45:59,948
# Down by the riverside

615
00:46:00,198 --> 00:46:03,618
# Down by the riverside

616
00:46:03,744 --> 00:46:05,704
# Strike up the band

617
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:07,873
# Start the parade

618
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:12,294
# Don't let that grand old rhythm fade

619
00:46:12,419 --> 00:46:16,965
# Just play that drum, play that number

620
00:46:17,091 --> 00:46:21,095
# When the saints come marchin' in

621
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:23,347
# Shake tambourines

622
00:46:23,472 --> 00:46:25,599
# Play that cornet

623
00:46:25,724 --> 00:46:30,187
# That trumpet horn you won't forget

624
00:46:30,312 --> 00:46:34,775
# Your heart will hum to that number

625
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:38,946
# When the saints come marchin' in

626
00:46:39,071 --> 00:46:41,115
# The cymbals clang

627
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,326
# Just pound that beat

628
00:46:43,451 --> 00:46:47,830
# Sounds like a hundred marching feet

629
00:46:47,955 --> 00:46:52,418
# It's fun to join in that number

630
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:56,631
# When the saints come marchin' in

631
00:46:56,756 --> 00:46:58,883
# See banners wave

632
00:46:59,008 --> 00:47:00,969
# Oh, hear that ring

633
00:47:01,094 --> 00:47:05,640
# We all feel prouder than a king

634
00:47:05,765 --> 00:47:10,228
# Cos everyone,
everyone loves that number

635
00:47:10,353 --> 00:47:14,190
# When the saints come marchin' in

636
00:47:24,034 --> 00:47:27,579
I don't know about you, but I killed 'em.

637
00:47:27,704 --> 00:47:30,374
- The audience loves us.
- What's not to love?

638
00:47:30,499 --> 00:47:34,795
See you at the Colonial House. Peg and I
have to pick out our costumes for the ball.

639
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:39,258
- What are you going as?
- Lady Godiva. What else?

640
00:47:39,383 --> 00:47:43,679
Lady Godiva?!
That sure ain't fair to New Orleans.

641
00:47:43,804 --> 00:47:46,765
Let's hope she gets a long wig.

642
00:48:03,407 --> 00:48:05,451
Ah!

643
00:48:06,244 --> 00:48:09,789
You're sure there'll be nobody
at the ball dressed like me?

644
00:48:09,914 --> 00:48:15,920
Madam, in my shop we specialise
in one-of-a-kind costumes.

645
00:48:16,045 --> 00:48:19,215
Let's face it - you're adorable!

646
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:22,010
How can any man resist you?

647
00:48:22,135 --> 00:48:25,513
My problem is just the other way around.

648
00:48:29,726 --> 00:48:31,770
Allow me, my dear.

649
00:48:32,646 --> 00:48:34,689
Thank you.

650
00:48:41,154 --> 00:48:43,532
Little Bo Peep has lost her sheep.

651
00:48:48,161 --> 00:48:50,372
I don't blame 'em for running away.

652
00:48:52,583 --> 00:48:54,418
How do I look?

653
00:48:54,543 --> 00:48:59,089
Oh, honey! If I were Louis XV,
I'd make you queen.

654
00:48:59,214 --> 00:49:01,342
Well, I'll get our clothes.

655
00:49:01,467 --> 00:49:03,218
Ah-ha-ha!

656
00:49:03,344 --> 00:49:06,180
Are you sure I'll be the only
Madam Pompadour at the ball?

657
00:49:06,305 --> 00:49:12,728
My dear lady, this is a one-of-a-kind
costume that I imported from Paris.

658
00:49:12,853 --> 00:49:18,109
Well, Little Bo Peep
is ready for action. OK?

659
00:49:27,326 --> 00:49:31,831
Ah, charming! What Madam Pompadour
would have given to look like you.

660
00:49:31,956 --> 00:49:35,209
Her head. Or was that Marie Antoinette?

661
00:49:35,335 --> 00:49:37,712
Is this a good night
to go out with the wrong man

662
00:49:37,837 --> 00:49:40,048
so the right man'll ask me to marry him?

663
00:49:40,173 --> 00:49:45,970
Well, for that, any night is the right night.
Especially on Mardi Gras night.

664
00:49:51,601 --> 00:49:55,939
Harry, give me a hand. We still have
ten Madam Pompadours to get rid of.

665
00:50:19,505 --> 00:50:21,548
Guess who.

666
00:50:21,674 --> 00:50:24,051
Nellie? I thought
you'd changed your mind.

667
00:50:24,176 --> 00:50:26,011
Nellie?! Why, Johnny, you...!

668
00:50:26,136 --> 00:50:30,391
Frankie, I... I knew it was you.
I was trying to make you jealous.

669
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:35,438
- Convinced?
- That was a guilty kiss if I ever had one.

670
00:50:35,563 --> 00:50:37,898
- Let's go.
- Go where?

671
00:50:38,024 --> 00:50:42,695
You know Braden's holding open house
in suite 309. Come on.

672
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:46,991
- I promised to wait here for Cully.
- Cully and who else?

673
00:50:47,116 --> 00:50:49,410
Just Cully. I swear.

674
00:50:49,535 --> 00:50:51,913
With the left hand?

675
00:50:52,038 --> 00:50:54,791
All right, I'll meet you there. Suite 309.

676
00:50:54,916 --> 00:50:56,960
Frankie?

677
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:01,422
Remember how to do that
after we get married.

678
00:51:06,344 --> 00:51:08,930
Well, I fooled her.

679
00:51:10,682 --> 00:51:12,809
Watch it! I'm not gettin' any younger.

680
00:51:12,934 --> 00:51:15,854
- Did you find Nellie?
- Braden set her up in room 306.

681
00:51:15,979 --> 00:51:18,815
She said to meet her there.
Can't I talk you out of this?

682
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:21,818
Not a chance. Go up to 309
and keep Frankie busy.

683
00:51:21,943 --> 00:51:25,238
I promised to do a number with the band.

684
00:51:30,535 --> 00:51:32,454
Last year's model.

685
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:37,626
# Everybody, listen to me

686
00:51:37,751 --> 00:51:40,295
# Put a smile on your face

687
00:51:40,421 --> 00:51:44,216
# There's no reason to be gloomy

688
00:51:44,341 --> 00:51:49,471
# This world's a wonderful place

689
00:51:49,597 --> 00:51:51,557
# So let me sing, get happy

690
00:51:51,682 --> 00:51:53,267
# Shout it out

691
00:51:53,392 --> 00:51:55,311
# Yeah, get happy now

692
00:51:55,436 --> 00:51:57,104
# Shout it out

693
00:51:57,229 --> 00:52:01,108
# Well, now, there is no doubt
you've a lot to shout about

694
00:52:01,233 --> 00:52:04,612
# Give a yell, life is swell, shout it out

695
00:52:04,737 --> 00:52:08,366
# While there's good food you can taste

696
00:52:08,491 --> 00:52:11,994
# While there's music, life's no waste

697
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:15,498
# While there's great things happening

698
00:52:15,623 --> 00:52:18,918
# There's no end to the joy life can bring

699
00:52:19,043 --> 00:52:21,129
# I said come on, get happy

700
00:52:21,254 --> 00:52:22,755
# Shout it out

701
00:52:22,881 --> 00:52:24,841
# Yeah, get happy now

702
00:52:24,966 --> 00:52:26,551
# Shout it out

703
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:30,305
# Well, now, there is no doubt
you've a lot to shout about

704
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:33,767
# Give a yell, life is swell, shout it out

705
00:52:33,892 --> 00:52:37,437
# As long as there's someone
you can love

706
00:52:37,562 --> 00:52:41,024
# As long as bright stars shine above

707
00:52:41,149 --> 00:52:44,694
# You've got no reason to be blue

708
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:48,240
# Think what it means
when your dreams all come true

709
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:50,409
# I said come on, get happy

710
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:52,077
# Shout it out

711
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:54,162
# Yeah, get happy now

712
00:52:54,288 --> 00:52:55,789
# Shout it out

713
00:52:55,914 --> 00:52:59,626
# Well, now, there is no doubt
you've a lot to shout about

714
00:52:59,752 --> 00:53:03,047
# Give a yell, life is swell, shout it out

715
00:53:03,172 --> 00:53:07,092
# I said, now, there is no doubt
you've a lot to shout about

716
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:11,263
# Give a yell, life is swell, shout it out

717
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:14,433
# There is no doubt
you've a lot to shout about

718
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:17,353
# Give a yell, life is swell, shout it out

719
00:53:17,478 --> 00:53:18,688
# Shout it out

720
00:53:29,448 --> 00:53:33,578
Respect. Respect for Father Time!

721
00:53:33,703 --> 00:53:37,707
- Frankie! Where are you going?
- Frankie? It's me.

722
00:53:37,832 --> 00:53:39,876
- Mitzi!
- Oh!

723
00:53:41,169 --> 00:53:45,006
- Nobody loves me.
- I love you.

724
00:53:45,131 --> 00:53:49,427
- You're dressed just like Frankie.
- That's why I'm leaving.

725
00:53:49,552 --> 00:53:55,433
I caught Braden kissing me when
he thought he was kissing Frankie. Hmph!

726
00:53:55,558 --> 00:54:00,063
I hate Nellie, but I'm gonna
tell her what's goin' on.

727
00:54:00,188 --> 00:54:07,362
- Why tell her?
- I want her to be as miserable as I am.

728
00:54:09,573 --> 00:54:12,701
Happy... happy...

729
00:54:12,826 --> 00:54:14,870
whatever it is we're celebrating.

730
00:54:14,995 --> 00:54:17,456
- That calls for a kiss.
- Go away, old man.

731
00:54:17,581 --> 00:54:20,709
Old man?! It's me!

732
00:54:21,877 --> 00:54:24,004
Go away, old man.

733
00:54:25,589 --> 00:54:28,592
Happy... happy...

734
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:39,145
- How about a kiss for the boss?
- Remember? I'm Johnny's girl.

735
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:45,067
- Johnny? Where do you suppose he is?
- Where do you suppose Nellie is?

736
00:54:45,192 --> 00:54:47,904
Hello, everyone. It's me - Cully.

737
00:54:48,029 --> 00:54:51,949
- Hey! You and Mitzi are wearing...
- I thought you were meeting Johnny.

738
00:54:52,075 --> 00:54:54,660
- Where is he?
- Singing. Singing with the band.

739
00:54:54,786 --> 00:54:57,121
He never sounded better. His vibrato...

740
00:54:57,246 --> 00:55:00,500
His vibrato had better not be
in Nellie's room.

741
00:55:00,625 --> 00:55:04,170
- Where is it?
- Right down the hall. 306.

742
00:55:04,295 --> 00:55:07,048
Let you know if we're both wrong.

743
00:55:09,092 --> 00:55:11,636
Hold it, pedal pusher.

744
00:55:11,761 --> 00:55:15,473
- Where is Johnny, really?
- Not with Nellie, if that's what you think.

745
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,226
- That's what he thinks.
- Shut up, Blackie.

746
00:55:18,351 --> 00:55:19,769
I didn't open my mouth.

747
00:55:19,895 --> 00:55:25,484
Would Nellie two-time you?
Would Johnny? They'd be crazy!

748
00:55:25,609 --> 00:55:27,819
Fill it up, Blackie.

749
00:55:33,283 --> 00:55:36,245
Come in, Johnny! Be right with you!

750
00:55:39,915 --> 00:55:42,084
Get up!

751
00:55:42,209 --> 00:55:46,046
- Who are you?
- You know darn well who I am!

752
00:55:46,171 --> 00:55:52,428
Hey! You'll never believe it,
but you and me and Nellie are triplets!

753
00:55:52,553 --> 00:55:54,513
Mitzi!

754
00:55:55,264 --> 00:55:57,725
What are you doing here?

755
00:55:59,018 --> 00:56:01,729
First you gotta tell me where I am.

756
00:56:01,854 --> 00:56:03,689
Well!

757
00:56:03,814 --> 00:56:06,234
As one Madam Pompadour to the other...

758
00:56:06,359 --> 00:56:09,111
Why did you say "Come in, Johnny"
when I knocked?

759
00:56:09,237 --> 00:56:12,281
Because I was expecting him.
Any objections?

760
00:56:12,406 --> 00:56:15,952
If I start to pull your hair out,
I'm not going to stop at your wig!

761
00:56:16,077 --> 00:56:20,707
Johnny thinks I'm his Lady Luck. He just
wants me to go to the casino with him.

762
00:56:20,832 --> 00:56:22,959
What else does he have in mind?

763
00:56:23,084 --> 00:56:26,838
Well, that depends on
how much he wins...

764
00:56:26,963 --> 00:56:29,758
or how much I want to lose.

765
00:56:30,842 --> 00:56:33,637
Attention! I want attention, please!

766
00:56:33,762 --> 00:56:38,266
Wouldn't it be funny
if Johnny made love to me

767
00:56:38,391 --> 00:56:41,978
when he thought
he was making love to Nellie,

768
00:56:42,103 --> 00:56:44,439
only it turned out to be you!

769
00:56:47,192 --> 00:56:50,404
- She's not as dumb as she looks.
- Five'll get you ten.

770
00:56:50,529 --> 00:56:55,284
No, wait a minute. She has a great idea.
Put on your mask.

771
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:03,333
What do you have in mind?

772
00:57:04,084 --> 00:57:06,420
A little masquerade.

773
00:57:06,545 --> 00:57:10,216
But first, what's the real reason
you're going out with Johnny?

774
00:57:10,341 --> 00:57:14,470
- To come between us?
- Of course not. To make Braden jealous.

775
00:57:14,595 --> 00:57:16,764
Jealous enough to ask me to marry him.

776
00:57:16,889 --> 00:57:20,267
- You really love him!
- As much as you love Johnny.

777
00:57:20,393 --> 00:57:24,105
Good. Now, let's hear you say:

778
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:28,568
Johnny, do you suppose I could
come between you and Frankie?

779
00:57:28,693 --> 00:57:33,740
Johnny, do you suppose
I could come between you and Frankie?

780
00:57:33,865 --> 00:57:37,744
Johnny, do you suppose I could
come between you and Frankie?

781
00:57:37,869 --> 00:57:40,246
- That's amazing!
- And convincing?

782
00:57:40,371 --> 00:57:42,540
You sound more like me than I do!

783
00:57:42,665 --> 00:57:44,709
Now walk.

784
00:57:48,379 --> 00:57:52,175
You've got to be born with that. But I'll try.

785
00:57:53,843 --> 00:57:56,054
That's good!

786
00:58:01,226 --> 00:58:03,270
Nellie?

787
00:58:10,777 --> 00:58:12,863
- Nellie?
- Come in, darling!

788
00:58:16,533 --> 00:58:19,077
- Sorry I'm late.
- I'll be with you in a minute.

789
00:58:19,203 --> 00:58:21,330
I have to get a handkerchief.

790
00:58:21,455 --> 00:58:26,335
Tonight's the night. I can feel it.
That roulette wheel's gonna light up.

791
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:31,048
- So will Frankie if she finds out about it.
- Oh, she'd kill me.

792
00:58:31,173 --> 00:58:34,051
Yes, she would. Just like in the song.

793
00:58:36,929 --> 00:58:39,932
Ready or not, here I come!

794
00:58:40,057 --> 00:58:42,601
We'll live it up tonight!

795
00:58:47,064 --> 00:58:52,987
- Now we'll prove the gypsy was right.
- We'll do more than that, won't we?

796
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:56,074
You're for me, Nellie, all the way.

797
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:02,455
Nellie! Nellie, where are you goin'?

798
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:09,170
Nobody'll talk to me any more.

799
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:13,133
I've been abandoned.

800
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:18,346
- But Johnny isn't with Nellie. I told you.
- Then why wasn't she at my party?

801
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:24,561
- Don't go bruisin' your knuckles, Boss.
- I don't need any nursemaids.

802
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:29,524
Who's there? Identify yourself.

803
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,693
Mitzi?

804
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:35,197
Come in, honey!

805
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:41,286
What are you doing here? Where's Nellie?

806
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:47,251
I'm here because I'm here...
alone... by the world forgot.

807
00:59:47,376 --> 00:59:49,503
I said, where's Nellie?

808
00:59:49,628 --> 00:59:53,299
Her? Oh, she went out with Johnny.

809
00:59:53,424 --> 00:59:56,051
I knew I was right.

810
00:59:56,177 --> 01:00:01,932
She's cheating on you,
he's cheating on Frankie...

811
01:00:02,058 --> 01:00:04,268
Why don't you cheat on somebody?

812
01:00:04,393 --> 01:00:07,188
I have been taken.

813
01:00:07,313 --> 01:00:09,774
I haven't!

814
01:00:10,566 --> 01:00:15,655
- Well, two can play that little game.
- Two like me and you?

815
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:18,449
I just love games!

816
01:00:20,952 --> 01:00:23,079
Welcome home.

817
01:00:23,204 --> 01:00:26,457
Watch the wig! It's rented!

818
01:00:37,093 --> 01:00:39,930
- Who was that?
- Must've been Frankie.

819
01:00:40,055 --> 01:00:45,310
- What was she doing here?
- How should I know? It's not my room.

820
01:00:52,359 --> 01:00:55,320
- You worried about Braden?
- You worried about Frankie?

821
01:00:55,445 --> 01:00:58,657
What she doesn't know
won't hurt her, will it?

822
01:00:58,782 --> 01:01:01,785
Chips, please. Lucky ones.

823
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:06,248
You stand right over here,
where you were before. That's it.

824
01:01:06,373 --> 01:01:11,086
Frankie's cricket, for insurance.
How can I lose?

825
01:01:11,211 --> 01:01:13,255
Got my lucky girl with me.

826
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:17,510
- What number do you like?
- Two. Like in Frankie and you.

827
01:01:17,635 --> 01:01:20,388
Why not? It rhymes.

828
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:23,474
Spin it real pretty.

829
01:01:35,194 --> 01:01:40,450
- A winner. Two, black.
- How about that! I can't miss with you!

830
01:01:40,575 --> 01:01:45,079
- Pick another number and we'll be rich.
- How about playing your age? Five.

831
01:01:45,205 --> 01:01:48,416
- Five it is. Who wants to grow up?
- You're over the limit, sir.

832
01:01:48,541 --> 01:01:50,376
Then raise it.

833
01:01:52,379 --> 01:01:54,673
- The limit's off, sir.
- So is your hand.

834
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:57,133
- My hand?
- Off the magnet button.

835
01:01:57,258 --> 01:02:00,345
- Or shall I say it loud and clear?
- We run an honest wheel.

836
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:02,681
The two of us are gonna see to that.

837
01:02:02,806 --> 01:02:07,436
- Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
- Don't be chintzy. Bet it all.

838
01:02:07,561 --> 01:02:10,731
- On the five?
- And cover all the corners.

839
01:02:10,856 --> 01:02:14,192
- You really know the game.
- I used to go with a gambler.

840
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:18,405
I'll surround that five so it can't get away.

841
01:02:20,157 --> 01:02:23,118
Broke again, but just for a minute.

842
01:02:32,503 --> 01:02:35,798
"We run an honest game," remember?

843
01:02:45,975 --> 01:02:49,186
- Five.
- Cash me in, will you?

844
01:02:49,312 --> 01:02:52,940
- $10,000. Didn't I tell you we'd do it?
- Yes, you did.

845
01:02:53,065 --> 01:02:56,152
From now on, it's me and you, Nellie,
in every casino.

846
01:02:56,277 --> 01:02:58,446
Are you with me?

847
01:02:58,571 --> 01:03:00,073
Why not?

848
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:08,665
It can't be. No two women kiss alike.

849
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:13,128
"It can't be" is right! "From now on,
it's you and me, Nellie. Are you with me?"

850
01:03:13,253 --> 01:03:16,965
Well, maybe she is, but I'm not!

851
01:03:18,049 --> 01:03:20,677
- What happened?
- He won and I lost.

852
01:03:20,802 --> 01:03:23,597
And it's just the way I want it!
We're all washed up!

853
01:03:23,722 --> 01:03:27,768
- I don't believe you.
- No? Have a ball.

854
01:03:27,893 --> 01:03:30,979
I might just be in the mood.

855
01:03:35,108 --> 01:03:40,697
- You sure murdered 'em tonight.
- Yeah, right through the heart.

856
01:03:45,577 --> 01:03:47,621
Frankie! You came back.

857
01:03:57,882 --> 01:04:00,301
Nellie! What are you doing here?

858
01:04:00,426 --> 01:04:06,641
Maybe the gypsy was right.
Maybe we were meant for each other.

859
01:04:09,393 --> 01:04:12,688
Gee, it's great to be number one again.

860
01:04:12,814 --> 01:04:15,566
Hold the thought.

861
01:04:17,402 --> 01:04:20,029
What about your plan
to make Braden jealous?

862
01:04:20,154 --> 01:04:25,827
It backfired. He switched to Mitzi...
so I'm switching to you.

863
01:04:25,952 --> 01:04:28,872
- I could do worse.
- I doubt it.

864
01:04:30,248 --> 01:04:33,668
You're still a loser, winner.

865
01:04:39,633 --> 01:04:42,302
I owe you seven weeks' salary, plus...

866
01:05:01,738 --> 01:05:03,782
Oh!

867
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:10,164
It was only champagne, honey.

868
01:05:10,289 --> 01:05:14,627
He's all yours, Mitzi. What's left of him.

869
01:05:18,672 --> 01:05:22,802
- Back to 306?
- No. Back to Frankie, if she'll have me.

870
01:05:22,927 --> 01:05:25,721
Gypsy or no gypsy.

871
01:05:25,846 --> 01:05:29,141
Well! Alone at last.

872
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:35,815
OK, so I got the money
for Broadway. So what?

873
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:41,571
- You sure Frankie walked out on you?
- I can still feel her farewell message.

874
01:05:43,197 --> 01:05:46,701
- Sorry to interrupt the party.
- Frankie!

875
01:05:46,826 --> 01:05:48,453
Look!

876
01:05:48,578 --> 01:05:51,039
Look. This is our big-time bankroll.

877
01:05:51,164 --> 01:05:52,999
- We got it made!
- "We"?

878
01:05:53,124 --> 01:05:57,504
Sure. The gypsy was wrong.
I don't need a redhead. I need you.

879
01:05:57,629 --> 01:06:01,508
You're my Lady Luck.
You're the family banker.

880
01:06:01,633 --> 01:06:04,928
You know what I think of this money,
or any gambling money?

881
01:06:05,053 --> 01:06:07,097
I'll show you.

882
01:06:08,849 --> 01:06:10,892
You wouldn't!

883
01:06:14,062 --> 01:06:16,106
You would.

884
01:06:24,198 --> 01:06:27,076
Money! Fifty-dollar bills!

885
01:06:37,127 --> 01:06:40,840
Lady, you won't believe it,
but some nut's throwin' his money away!

886
01:06:40,965 --> 01:06:44,010
I believe it.

887
01:06:44,135 --> 01:06:46,637
Giddap. Come on.

888
01:06:49,765 --> 01:06:52,935
- How disgusting!
- Money! Dropping out of the clouds!

889
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:55,563
Money?! Let me in there!

890
01:06:55,688 --> 01:06:59,150
Get out of my way! Let me in there!

891
01:07:04,489 --> 01:07:07,242
Hey, folks! Folks?

892
01:07:07,367 --> 01:07:11,329
- The money flying out of that window...
- Money? What money?

893
01:07:11,454 --> 01:07:15,041
- I accidentally dropped it.
- I didn't see any money. Did you?

894
01:07:15,166 --> 01:07:17,210
No!

895
01:07:18,503 --> 01:07:21,047
I don't guess you did, did you?

896
01:07:32,142 --> 01:07:35,479
Hey, kid. Did you see the money
flying out the window up there?

897
01:07:35,604 --> 01:07:39,733
- No, sir. I didn't see any money.
- OK.

898
01:07:39,858 --> 01:07:45,364
- Got change for a fifty, mister?
- No, I ain't got change for one.

899
01:07:54,999 --> 01:08:00,087
# Oh, I'm really feelin' mighty low

900
01:08:04,759 --> 01:08:07,386
# No, no, no

901
01:08:07,511 --> 01:08:10,598
# I got no place that I can go

902
01:08:13,601 --> 01:08:17,105
# So I got some blues to sing

903
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:23,027
# And oh, so much remembering, woe

904
01:08:28,324 --> 01:08:32,871
# Black cats, keep away from me

905
01:08:33,955 --> 01:08:36,583
# Take my advice

906
01:08:36,708 --> 01:08:38,335
# Go shinny up a tree

907
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:41,838
# I've got hard luck

908
01:08:41,963 --> 01:08:47,135
# The hardest kind of luck you'll find

909
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:50,180
# I ain't lyin'

910
01:08:50,305 --> 01:08:53,809
# I've got the bluest kind of blues

911
01:08:53,934 --> 01:08:59,106
# And it's drivin' me right out of my mind

912
01:09:03,652 --> 01:09:06,155
# She's gone

913
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:09,241
# Said toodle-oo

914
01:09:09,366 --> 01:09:13,621
# I kissed her goodbye, and my money too

915
01:09:13,746 --> 01:09:17,249
# I've got hard luck

916
01:09:17,374 --> 01:09:22,505
# The hardest kind of luck you've seen

917
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:25,341
# I mean

918
01:09:25,466 --> 01:09:29,136
# The way I'm runnin' lately

919
01:09:29,262 --> 01:09:33,850
# My lucky number is thirteen

920
01:09:37,895 --> 01:09:40,523
# Where do I belong?

921
01:09:40,648 --> 01:09:42,817
# Everything I do is wrong

922
01:09:42,942 --> 01:09:45,612
# All wrong

923
01:09:45,737 --> 01:09:49,032
# Wrong as can be

924
01:09:49,157 --> 01:09:51,785
# Who's stackin' all the decks?

925
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:56,915
# Lady Luck has got the hex on me

926
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:01,294
# Permanently

927
01:10:01,419 --> 01:10:03,797
# Shove off

928
01:10:03,922 --> 01:10:06,800
# Boy, I'm warnin' you

929
01:10:06,925 --> 01:10:11,263
# This thing I caught, you know,
could be catchin' too

930
01:10:11,388 --> 01:10:14,641
# I've got hard luck

931
01:10:14,766 --> 01:10:19,813
# The hardest kind of luck there can be

932
01:10:19,938 --> 01:10:23,734
# Yes, siree

933
01:10:23,859 --> 01:10:27,571
# I guess hard luck always chooses

934
01:10:27,696 --> 01:10:33,494
# Natural-born losers like me

935
01:10:57,727 --> 01:11:00,354
How long have we been drinking?

936
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:03,524
Since last night.

937
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:08,404
How's your head? The one
I opened the champagne bottle on.

938
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:14,369
You really launched me.
But you did knock some sense into it.

939
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:18,248
You found out that
it's really me that you go for?

940
01:11:18,373 --> 01:11:21,126
No! It's Nellie.

941
01:11:21,835 --> 01:11:24,921
But Nellie went bye-bye!

942
01:11:28,633 --> 01:11:32,220
How could she run out on me...

943
01:11:32,345 --> 01:11:35,098
with Johnny Nothing?

944
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:39,728
Women! Whoever invented them?

945
01:11:39,853 --> 01:11:42,064
Come in!

946
01:11:44,817 --> 01:11:47,778
- Did you find 'em?
- Couldn't find 'em anywhere.

947
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:53,158
- I turned New Orleans upside down.
- How does it look that way?

948
01:11:53,951 --> 01:11:56,829
You want me to throw her out?
It's no bother.

949
01:11:56,954 --> 01:11:59,832
Two more drinks and she'll float out.

950
01:11:59,957 --> 01:12:04,045
Looks like no Johnny, no Frankie,

951
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:05,629
no Nellie.

952
01:12:05,755 --> 01:12:08,090
But you've still got me.

953
01:12:08,215 --> 01:12:12,970
Charming, lovable, talented Mitzi.

954
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:16,140
The girl with a past...

955
01:12:16,265 --> 01:12:18,810
and no future.

956
01:12:20,645 --> 01:12:23,398
You should've done
what my father did to my mother.

957
01:12:23,523 --> 01:12:25,733
- What was that?
- Marry her.

958
01:12:25,858 --> 01:12:28,903
You should've married Nellie Bly.

959
01:12:29,028 --> 01:12:34,492
Maybe. But I hated to spoil
such a beautiful friendship.

960
01:12:35,243 --> 01:12:39,622
What a world. Everybody's split up.

961
01:12:39,748 --> 01:12:43,251
You and Nellie, Frankie and Johnny,

962
01:12:43,376 --> 01:12:45,420
me and...

963
01:12:45,545 --> 01:12:48,048
and anybody.

964
01:13:00,561 --> 01:13:05,149
If anybody cares, I'm back, and I'm sorry.

965
01:13:05,274 --> 01:13:07,943
Nobody cares.

966
01:13:11,322 --> 01:13:17,995
# Please don't stop loving me

967
01:13:19,246 --> 01:13:26,087
# You were born just to be

968
01:13:27,254 --> 01:13:29,924
# In my arms

969
01:13:31,342 --> 01:13:34,011
# In my arms

970
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:42,311
# Please don't stop loving me

971
01:13:43,771 --> 01:13:50,653
# Your lips were made just to be

972
01:13:51,613 --> 01:13:54,282
# Kissed by me

973
01:13:55,784 --> 01:13:58,453
# Kissed by me

974
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,709
# When I'm with you

975
01:14:06,086 --> 01:14:08,755
# I don't know

976
01:14:10,424 --> 01:14:13,093
# Day from night

977
01:14:14,177 --> 01:14:16,847
# Wrong from right

978
01:14:18,307 --> 01:14:20,976
# You're my world

979
01:14:22,311 --> 01:14:24,813
# That's all I know

980
01:14:24,938 --> 01:14:28,358
# I love you so

981
01:14:28,484 --> 01:14:32,488
# I won't let go

982
01:14:32,613 --> 01:14:38,702
# Please don't stop loving me

983
01:14:40,746 --> 01:14:47,420
# Darling, you'll always be

984
01:14:48,713 --> 01:14:51,716
# Mine alone

985
01:14:52,884 --> 01:15:00,099
# Mine alone

986
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:14,114
- Who is it?
- Frankie.

987
01:15:16,074 --> 01:15:18,868
I'm sorry Johnny and I
missed the show last night.

988
01:15:18,993 --> 01:15:22,622
- What about tonight?
- You've still got the show for two months.

989
01:15:22,747 --> 01:15:25,208
But only because
you paid Johnny in advance.

990
01:15:25,333 --> 01:15:26,877
Can I count on two months?

991
01:15:27,002 --> 01:15:30,422
If I don't shoot him for real
in the "Frankie and Johnny" number.

992
01:15:30,547 --> 01:15:33,675
Hey, there's a thought!

993
01:15:35,093 --> 01:15:37,971
Come on, Mitzi. We got an act to do.

994
01:15:39,556 --> 01:15:43,101
I love him. He loves Nellie.

995
01:15:43,227 --> 01:15:47,106
There never should've been two sexes.

996
01:15:57,867 --> 01:16:02,788
Hey, Boss. Wouldn't it be nice
if Frankie shot Johnny, like she said?

997
01:16:02,913 --> 01:16:05,166
No such luck.

998
01:16:18,846 --> 01:16:21,933
No. I've got enough nerve now.

999
01:16:23,518 --> 01:16:25,561
Before I do it,

1000
01:16:26,521 --> 01:16:30,650
- would you tell me something, Pete?
- Before you do what?

1001
01:16:30,775 --> 01:16:33,528
Can a gal get away with shootin' her guy?

1002
01:16:33,653 --> 01:16:37,490
- What girl? What guy?
- You don't follow too good.

1003
01:16:39,034 --> 01:16:41,911
This is him.

1004
01:16:42,037 --> 01:16:44,539
This is her.

1005
01:16:44,664 --> 01:16:47,417
Her shoots him

1006
01:16:47,542 --> 01:16:51,463
for two-timin' her with her.

1007
01:16:51,588 --> 01:16:54,841
Now, does her get away with it?

1008
01:16:55,384 --> 01:16:57,844
Or does her...

1009
01:16:57,970 --> 01:17:00,013
get it in the neck?

1010
01:17:03,183 --> 01:17:06,145
I'd say not guilty,
but of course I ain't no judge.

1011
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:09,940
Thanks, Pete. You're a real pal.

1012
01:17:12,609 --> 01:17:16,030
Do you think a girl
should believe a man like Johnny?

1013
01:17:16,155 --> 01:17:20,201
No woman should ever believe any man,
but we always do.

1014
01:17:20,326 --> 01:17:22,995
- Are you ready to forgive him?
- Not a chance!

1015
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,164
Frankie, honey.

1016
01:17:25,289 --> 01:17:27,333
Yes, Johnny, dear?

1017
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:33,422
Remember, in a situation like this,
always do the honest thing: Lie.

1018
01:17:33,547 --> 01:17:38,803
- It's me, the reformed gambler.
- Come in, reformed gambler.

1019
01:17:40,888 --> 01:17:42,932
She's playing hard to get.

1020
01:17:43,057 --> 01:17:45,101
You missed me.

1021
01:17:45,810 --> 01:17:47,645
The kid's got a great arm.

1022
01:17:52,984 --> 01:17:55,445
Hey, Eddie.

1023
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:58,031
Do you think a girl
could get away with murder

1024
01:17:58,156 --> 01:18:01,368
just because she's beautiful
and got nice legs?

1025
01:18:01,493 --> 01:18:03,536
Not if I was on the jury.

1026
01:18:04,996 --> 01:18:07,541
She'd have to have a nice figure too.

1027
01:18:10,085 --> 01:18:12,671
Like Frankie's? Is that what you mean?

1028
01:18:12,796 --> 01:18:18,385
If my wife had a face, legs and figure like
Frankie, I'd give up work and stay home.

1029
01:18:48,416 --> 01:18:52,753
Frankie says you've been
hitting the bottle over me.

1030
01:18:52,878 --> 01:18:56,507
- Was she telling the truth?
- Nellie!

1031
01:18:56,632 --> 01:19:01,512
- You are just in time.
- Just in time for what?

1032
01:19:01,637 --> 01:19:04,390
I wanna propose a merger.

1033
01:19:04,515 --> 01:19:09,228
A merger like two companies...
or a merger like two people?

1034
01:19:09,354 --> 01:19:11,648
A merger like marriage.

1035
01:19:14,651 --> 01:19:19,364
- How about it?
- Ask me again after the show.

1036
01:19:27,205 --> 01:19:31,543
I want to play hard to get, for a change.

1037
01:19:55,734 --> 01:19:57,778
I forgot Frankie's gun.

1038
01:20:06,036 --> 01:20:09,332
All right, folks,
here we go. On stage.

1039
01:20:11,334 --> 01:20:13,794
- Frankie, you gotta forgive me.
- Why?

1040
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:19,509
- Because Johnny loves Frankie.
- Well, I'll tell her if I see her.

1041
01:20:27,642 --> 01:20:30,812
# This story has no moral

1042
01:20:31,354 --> 01:20:33,398
# Hmmm

1043
01:20:33,523 --> 01:20:36,985
# This story has no end

1044
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:39,404
# Hmmm

1045
01:20:39,529 --> 01:20:43,158
# This story only goes to show

1046
01:20:43,283 --> 01:20:47,120
# That there ain't no good in men

1047
01:20:47,245 --> 01:20:51,833
# They'll do you wrong

1048
01:20:51,958 --> 01:20:56,213
# Yes, they'll do you wrong

1049
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:05,389
# Frankie and me, we are lovers

1050
01:21:05,514 --> 01:21:09,143
# Oh Lordy, how we can love

1051
01:21:09,268 --> 01:21:12,354
# Swore to be true to each other

1052
01:21:12,479 --> 01:21:15,691
# Just as true as stars above

1053
01:21:15,816 --> 01:21:18,986
# Frankie, I'm your man

1054
01:21:19,111 --> 01:21:22,573
# I'll never do you wrong

1055
01:21:24,533 --> 01:21:28,371
# Johnny, he wasn't too lucky

1056
01:21:28,496 --> 01:21:32,500
# He was a loser that night

1057
01:21:32,625 --> 01:21:35,503
# So he tried to change his luck

1058
01:21:35,628 --> 01:21:38,297
# With a gal who wasn't right

1059
01:21:38,422 --> 01:21:42,009
# He's Frankie's man

1060
01:21:42,135 --> 01:21:46,014
# But he's doin' her wrong

1061
01:22:10,997 --> 01:22:15,877
# Frankie,
I don't wanna make you no trouble

1062
01:22:16,002 --> 01:22:19,589
# Honey, I don't wanna tell you no lie

1063
01:22:19,715 --> 01:22:21,592
# But...

1064
01:22:21,717 --> 01:22:24,678
# I saw your sweet man, Johnny

1065
01:22:24,803 --> 01:22:29,141
# He was messin' round
with that Nellie Bly

1066
01:22:29,266 --> 01:22:32,352
# Well, if he's your man

1067
01:22:33,562 --> 01:22:36,315
# Then he's doin' you wrong

1068
01:22:40,069 --> 01:22:43,614
# Frankie went back to find Johnny

1069
01:22:43,739 --> 01:22:46,909
# But she wasn't lookin' for fun

1070
01:22:48,077 --> 01:22:51,080
# In her sweet, dainty little hand

1071
01:22:51,205 --> 01:22:54,417
# She was totin' a 44 gun

1072
01:22:54,542 --> 01:22:57,795
# To shoot her man

1073
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:01,048
# Cos he was doin' her wrong

1074
01:23:09,474 --> 01:23:13,228
Blackie, who do you know
who can marry us right away?

1075
01:23:13,353 --> 01:23:15,897
- You and who?
- Nellie and me.

1076
01:23:16,022 --> 01:23:18,608
Johnny Nothing
was really nothing in her life.

1077
01:23:18,733 --> 01:23:24,406
How about that! Hey, Boss,
things are workin' out just like you...

1078
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:26,950
What's wrong?

1079
01:23:27,075 --> 01:23:31,037
I was only doin'
what I thought you wanted me to do.

1080
01:23:31,163 --> 01:23:34,082
What are you trying to say?

1081
01:23:34,207 --> 01:23:38,211
You know the blank cartridge
Frankie shoots Johnny with?

1082
01:23:38,337 --> 01:23:41,423
What about it?

1083
01:23:41,548 --> 01:23:44,885
It ain't blank. I put in a real bullet.

1084
01:23:45,010 --> 01:23:47,763
Frankie is gonna shoot Johnny dead.

1085
01:23:48,305 --> 01:23:50,349
You stupid...

1086
01:23:52,351 --> 01:23:54,770
- Sorry!
- What's the matter with him?

1087
01:23:54,895 --> 01:23:58,023
# He was her man

1088
01:23:58,148 --> 01:24:00,901
# She caught him doin' her wrong

1089
01:24:01,986 --> 01:24:04,029
Johnny?

1090
01:24:06,031 --> 01:24:09,368
# Frankie, I beg you, don't shoot me

1091
01:24:09,493 --> 01:24:12,913
# They'll put you away in a cell

1092
01:24:13,039 --> 01:24:16,000
# They'll put you
where the cold wind blows

1093
01:24:16,125 --> 01:24:20,338
# From the hottest corner of hell

1094
01:24:20,463 --> 01:24:24,592
# Johnny, you're my man

1095
01:24:26,511 --> 01:24:33,059
# But you're doin' me wrong

1096
01:24:44,696 --> 01:24:46,740
Don't shoot!

1097
01:24:46,865 --> 01:24:50,702
- Close the curtain!
- What's the matter, Mr Braden?

1098
01:24:50,827 --> 01:24:54,122
That was a real bullet.

1099
01:24:59,419 --> 01:25:03,840
Johnny, don't die!
Please don't die! I love you!

1100
01:25:03,966 --> 01:25:07,469
You can gamble all you want!

1101
01:25:07,594 --> 01:25:12,766
- You really mean that?
- I want you any way you are.

1102
01:25:12,891 --> 01:25:14,935
Baby, you got me.

1103
01:25:17,855 --> 01:25:20,316
But that gun was really loaded.

1104
01:25:21,025 --> 01:25:24,320
I did feel something.

1105
01:25:25,070 --> 01:25:29,241
Looks like a bullet dent.
But who put the bullet in the gun?

1106
01:25:29,367 --> 01:25:32,745
Let's just say a misguided friend.

1107
01:25:37,959 --> 01:25:42,463
I'm asking again:
Do you wanna get married?

1108
01:25:42,588 --> 01:25:45,049
What have I got to lose?

1109
01:25:46,509 --> 01:25:49,929
I think I'll give him the air.

1110
01:26:00,356 --> 01:26:03,568
# Everybody come aboard
the showboat tonight

1111
01:26:03,693 --> 01:26:05,904
# We're gonna dance till the morning light

1112
01:26:06,029 --> 01:26:10,784
# We'll have fun the whole night long
There'll be jokes and song

1113
01:26:10,909 --> 01:26:13,495
# Forget your troubles, forget your strife

1114
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:16,623
# You'll have the best time of your life

1115
01:26:16,748 --> 01:26:20,752
# Hey, everyone, let's go on with the show

1116
01:26:20,877 --> 01:26:23,213
# Way down by the levee

1117
01:26:23,338 --> 01:26:25,799
# The boat's at the bank

1118
01:26:25,924 --> 01:26:30,554
# Bring money to spend, you're welcome,
my friend, just walk up the plank

1119
01:26:30,679 --> 01:26:33,766
# Everybody, come aboard
the showboat tonight

1120
01:26:33,891 --> 01:26:36,310
# Look around at the happy sight

1121
01:26:36,435 --> 01:26:41,106
# We'll guarantee that you'll have a ball
Come one and all

1122
01:26:41,232 --> 01:26:44,026
# What a great night you've got in store

1123
01:26:44,151 --> 01:26:46,779
# You'll wanna keep coming back for more

1124
01:26:46,904 --> 01:26:51,283
# Hey, everyone, let's go on with the show

1125
01:26:51,409 --> 01:26:53,703
# What a great night you've got in store

1126
01:26:53,828 --> 01:26:56,956
# I'll bet you'll wanna
keep coming back for more

1127
01:26:57,081 --> 01:27:02,753
# Hey, everyone, let's go on with the show
