you promised to put me into society.

keep everything on a business basis.

Every time I get romantic with you,
you want to talk business.

that brings out the business in all women.

of you to help us.

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,118
-ls the opera over yet?
-Not yet, signore, in a few minutes.

166
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,077
I told you to slow that nag down.

167
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,310
On account of you,
I nearly heard the opera.

168
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,915
Once around the park, and drive slowly.
And none of your back talk.

169
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,238
[Singing]

170
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,950
You're still crazy about her?

171
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,917
And she's crazy about you, too?

172
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,434
Even if she was,
I couldn't ask her to marry me.

173
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,478
Don't worry.
The manager, he'll fix everything.

174
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,398
Anyhow, we're together again...

175
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,756
-you and me, just like old times.
-Yeah, like old times.

176
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,637
Yeah, you bet my life.

177
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,997
[Audience clapping]

178
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,150
If you pardon my saying so,
Mrs. Claypool...

179
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,119
Mr. Driftwood seems hardly the person
to handle your business affairs.

180
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,033
-I'm beginning to think the same thing.
-Bravo!

181
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,270
I made it.
How soon does the curtain go up?

182
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,113
The curtain, Mr. Driftwood,
will go up again next season.

183
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,079
-You've missed the entire opera.
-I only missed it by a few minutes.

184
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,839
I can go then?

185
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,708
Was I right? Isn't Lassparri
the greatest tenor that ever lived?

186
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,598
He's superb.
But what would you have to pay him?

187
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,954
What's the difference?

188
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,679
He must sail with us tomorrow
no matter what we pay.

189
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,479
-He would be worth $1,000 a night.
-How much?

190
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,955
-What does he do?
-What does he do, he sings.

191
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,793
You're willing to pay him
$1,000 a night just for singing?

192
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,350
You can get a phonograph record
of Minnie the Moocher for 75 cents.

193
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,908
For $1.25, you can get Minnie.

194
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,070
If you'll excuse me, Mrs. Claypool...

195
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,038
I think I had better arrange
to see Lassparri immediately.

196
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,873
-You are agreed, $1,000 a night?
-Just as you think.

197
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,599
$1,000. There must be some way
I can get a piece of this.

198
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,150
Wait. Why don't I sign Lassparri?
I represent Mrs. Claypool.

199
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,515
But I represent
the New York Opera Company.

200
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,910
Boy? Will you give my card
to Signor Lassparri, please?

201
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,431
[People chattering]

[Whistles]

203
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,270
What is it? What do you want?

204
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,030
LASSPARRl: Rosa.
ROSA: Yes, signore?

205
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,958
My good friend Herman Gottlieb
is coming back to see me.

206
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,996
How would you like
to have supper with us?

207
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,516
I'm terribly sorry, Signor Lassparri,
I already have an engagement.

208
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,715
I see.

209
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,431
That's too bad, because I have an idea...

210
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,273
he's going to invite me
to sing in New York.

211
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,314
And he may permit me
to select my leading lady.

212
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,278
Are you sure
you can't break your appointment?

213
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,556
I'm terribly sorry, signore.

[Clanging]

216
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,998
What do you mean by humiliating me
in front of those people?

217
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,071
You're fired, do you understand?

218
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,594
You big bully,
why are you hitting that little bully?

219
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,716
Will you kindly let me
handle my own affairs?

220
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,553
Get out. What do you got to say to me?

221
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,269
Can you sleep on your stomach
with such big buttons on your pajamas?

222
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,113
Why, you....

223
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,790
Nice work, I think you got him.

224
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,673
Smelling salts. That will bring him to.

225
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,916
You're sorry for what you did?
That shows a nice spirit.

226
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,159
Now he's coming along. He'll be fine now.

227
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,318
-Get fresh with me, huh?
-How do you do?

228
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,914
-Hello.
-What's the matter, mister?

229
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,231
We had an argument.
He pulled a knife on me, so I shot him.

230
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,596
-Do you mind if l....
-Go right ahead. Plenty of room.

231
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,517
-Two beers, bartender.
-I'll take two beers, too.

232
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,389
Things seem to be getting better
around the country.

233
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,789
I don't know. I'm a stranger here myself.

234
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,268
I came back here looking for somebody.
You don't know who it is, do you?

235
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,920
It's a funny thing, it just slipped my mind.

236
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,515
I know. The greatest tenor in the world.
That's what I'm after.

237
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,716
-Why, I'm his manager.
-Whose manager?

238
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,552
The greatest tenor in the world.

239
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,552
-The fellow that sings at the opera here?
-Sure.

240
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,868
What's his name?

241
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,555
What do you care? I can't pronounce it.
What do you want with him?

242
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,997
I want to sign him up
for the New York Opera Company.

243
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,594
Do you know that America is waiting
to hear him sing?

244
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,513
He can sing loud
but he can't sing that loud.

245
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,033
I think I can get America
to meet him halfway.

246
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,394
Could he sail tomorrow?

247
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,040
You pay him enough money,
he could sail yesterday.

248
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,473
How much you pay him?

249
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,950
I don't know. Let's see, $1,000 a night.

250
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,030
I'm entitled to a small profit.

251
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,194
-How about $10 a night?
-$10?

252
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,873
[Laughing]

253
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,313
I'll take it.

254
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,118
All right, but remember,
I get 10% for negotiating the deal.

255
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,953
Yes, and I get 10% for being the manager.

256
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,593
How much does that leave?

257
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,195
Well, that leaves him $8.

258
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,632
-He sends $5 home to his mother.
-That leaves $3.

259
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,511
Can he live in New York on $3?

260
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,794
Like a prince.

261
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,031
Of course, he won't be able to eat,
but he can live like a prince.

262
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,396
However, out of that $3,
he'll have to pay an income tax.

263
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,275
Yes, there's a federal tax, a state tax,
and a city tax...

264
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,710
a street tax, and a sewer tax.

265
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,279
How much does this come to?

266
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,318
I figure if he doesn't sing too often,
he can break even.

267
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,994
-All right, we take it.
-All right, fine.

268
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,559
Here are the contracts.

269
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,030
You just put his name at the top,
and you sign at the bottom.

270
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,839
No need of you reading that
because these are duplicates.

271
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,592
Yeah. Is a duplicate.

272
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,195
-Duplicates?
-I say, they're duplicates.

273
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,152
-Don't you know what duplicates are?
-Sure, those five kids up in Canada.

274
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,791
I wouldn't know about that.
I haven't been in Canada in years.

275
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,838
Go ahead and read it.

276
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,274
-What does it say?
-Go on and read it.

277
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,638
-You read it.
-All right, I'll read it to you.

278
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,519
-Can you hear?
-I haven't heard anything yet.

279
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,710
-You say anything?
-I haven't said anything worth hearing.

280
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,836
That's why I didn't hear anything.

281
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,195
That's why I didn't say anything.

282
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,237
-Can you read?
-I can read, but I can't see it.

283
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,034
Don't seem to have it in focus here.

284
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,353
If my arms were a little longer,
I could read it.

285
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,954
You haven't got a baboon
in your pocket, have you?

286
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,156
Here we are. Now I've got it.

287
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,392
Pay particular attention to this first clause
because it's most important.

288
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,950
It says, "The party of the first part
shall be known in this contract...

289
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,031
"as the party of the first part."

290
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,156
How do you like that?
That's pretty neat, eh?

291
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,798
No, it's no good.

292
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,069
-What's the matter with it?
-I don't know. Let's hear it again.

293
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,837
"The party of the first part
shall be known in this contract...

294
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,831
"as the party of the first part."

295
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,475
Sounds a little better this time.

296
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,989
It grows on you.
Would you like to hear it once more?

297
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,752
Just the first part.

298
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,837
What? "The party of the first part"?

299
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,037
No. The first part
of "the party of the first part."

300
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,390
It says, "The first part
of the party of the first part...

301
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,790
"shall be known in this contract
as the first part of the party....

302
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,518
"Shall be known in this contract...."

303
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,239
Why should we quarrel about this?
We'll take it out.

304
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,311
Yeah. It's too long anyhow.

305
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,357
Now what do we got left?

306
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,556
I got about a foot and a half.

307
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,036
It says, "The party of the second part
shall be known in this contract...

308
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,678
"as the party of the second part."

309
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,637
I don't know about that.

310
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,710
-Now what's the matter?
-I don't like the second party either.

311
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,759
You should have come to the first party.
We didn't get home till around 4:00 a.m.

312
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,831
I was blind for three days.

313
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,874
Why can't the first part
of the second party...

314
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,872
be the second part of the first party?
Then you got something.

315
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,838
Look, rather than go through that again,
what do you say....

316
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,955
Fine.

317
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,271
I've got something you're bound to like.
You'll be crazy about it.

318
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,679
No. I don't like it.

319
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,274
-You don't like what?
-Whatever it is, I don't like it.

320
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,670
Don't let's break up an old friendship
over a thing like that. Ready?

321
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,795
Okay.

322
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,149
The next part,
I don't think you're going to like.

323
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,789
Your word's good enough for me.
Is my word good enough for you?

324
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,031
-I should say not.
-That takes out two more clauses.

325
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,238
-"The party of the eighth part...."
-No, that's no good.

326

-Sure.

-Sure.

We've got a contract,

That? That's the usual clause.
That's in every contract.

337
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,189

"Two's company, five's a crowd."

490
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,116
We go, but we want something to eat.
We no eat all day. We're hungry.

491
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,031
We'll discuss the food situation later.

492
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,190
We get food, or we don't go.

493
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,796
I know I never should have
met you fellows.

494
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,269
Okay. But promise to scram out
after you've eaten.

495
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,032
-All right.
-I'll get the steward.

496
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,315
You fellows be quiet.
Remember, you're stowaways.

497

-We no say nothing.
-All right.

498
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,150
Now, just put that bag of Jell-O over here.

499
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,150
Wouldn't it be simpler
if you had him stuffed?

500
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,118
-He's no olive.
-I'll go and get the steward.

501
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,475
Is it the door of the room,
or am I in the trunk?

502
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,834
Over here.

503
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,673
Be quiet, now. Don't make any noise.

-Yes, sir.

-What's for dinner?
-Anything you like.

grape juice, pineapple juice....

is deaf and dumb...

I'd like two pillows on that bed there.

547
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,632
There's a slight misunderstanding here.

548
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,029
I said the girls had to work fast,
not your friend.

You know, he does better asleep
than I do awake.

551
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,518
Yeah, he always sleeps that way.

00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,910
-Now he's half-asleep.
-Yes, he's half-asleep in a half Nelson.

You know, if it wasn't for Gottlieb,
I wouldn't have got this room.

No. Come on in.

562
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,993
I hadn't planned on a manicure,
but on a journey like this...

563
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,674
you ought to have
every convenience you can get.

Did you want your nails long or short?

566
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,114
You better make them short.
It's getting kind of crowded in here.

567
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,797
I don't know. This isn't the way
I pictured an ocean voyage.

568
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,953
I always visualized myself in a steamer
chair with a steward bringing me bouillon.

569
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,109
Come on, Riccardo.

570
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,829
You couldn't get bouillon in unless
they brought it in through a keyhole.

571
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,913
I'm the engineer's assistant.

572
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,514
I had a premonition
you were going to show up.

573
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,231
The engineer's over there in the corner.
You can chop your way right through.

574
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,599
Is it my imagination,
or is it getting crowded in here?

find somebody just as good.

a fortune hunter, she's got me.

In fact, you can't call me a fortune hunter.

612
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,432
Because when I proposed to her,
I thought she only had $7 million.

613

with my feelings for her.

but the boat's too far away.

00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,478
What's he doing now?

676
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,398

Our guests have asked me to represent
them and to act as their interpreter.

682

If you'll follow me,
I'll take you to their cabin.

683
00:53:43,907 --> 00:53:47,138
If they're still in it,
very few of us will come out alive.

684
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:58,535
Pardon me. Our guests
are having their shredded wheat.

-Give me that. Let's cut this short.

688
00:54:10,907 --> 00:54:13,580
The whole thing is very simple.
You're going to City Hall.

689
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,259
The Mayor's gonna make another speech.

690

as mayor of this great city...

I take pleasure in inviting
our distinguished visitors...

694
00:54:26,227 --> 00:54:28,422

about their achievement.

-Tell them you're not here.
-Suppose they don't believe me?

Friends....

700
00:54:45,227 --> 00:54:47,661
Talk fast.
I see a man in the crowd with a rope.

701
00:54:48,307 --> 00:54:52,061
How we happen to come to America
is a great story, but I no tell that.

702
00:54:52,187 --> 00:54:53,506
When we first started out...

703
00:54:53,587 --> 00:54:56,704
we got no idea
you give us this grand reception.

704
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:58,745
We don't deserve it.

705
00:54:58,827 --> 00:55:00,579
When I say we don't deserve it...

706
00:55:00,667 --> 00:55:02,623
believe me, I know what I'm talking about.

707
00:55:02,707 --> 00:55:04,379
That's a novelty.

708
00:55:04,907 --> 00:55:06,784
Now I tell you how we fly to America.

709
00:55:07,027 --> 00:55:10,144
The first time, we get halfway across
when we run out of gasoline.

710
00:55:10,227 --> 00:55:11,546
We got to go back.

711
00:55:11,627 --> 00:55:13,618
Then I take twice as much gasoline.

712
00:55:13,707 --> 00:55:16,301
This time, we were just about to land,
maybe 3 feet...

713
00:55:16,387 --> 00:55:18,855
when, what do you think,
we run out of gasoline again.

714
00:55:18,947 --> 00:55:21,017
Back we go and get more gas.

715
00:55:21,107 --> 00:55:23,541
This time, I take plenty gas.

716
00:55:24,707 --> 00:55:27,585
We get halfway over,
when what do you think happened?

717
00:55:27,667 --> 00:55:29,225
We forgot the airplane.

718
00:55:29,307 --> 00:55:31,582
So we sit down and talk it over.

719
00:55:31,667 --> 00:55:33,419
Then I get the great idea...

720
00:55:33,507 --> 00:55:36,738
we no take gasoline.
We no take the airplane.

721
00:55:37,307 --> 00:55:38,979
We take steamship.

722
00:55:39,067 --> 00:55:42,218
And that, friends,
is how we fly across the ocean.

723

724
00:55:44,827 --> 00:55:46,658

This is the mayor again.

726
00:55:49,307 --> 00:55:53,346
And now I take great pleasure
in introducing another of our heroes...

727
00:55:53,467 --> 00:55:56,220
who will tell you something
of his exploits.

728
00:55:57,867 --> 00:55:58,936
Of course.

729
00:55:59,027 --> 00:56:01,336
From now on, it's every man for himself.

730
00:56:01,427 --> 00:56:05,466
I would suggest you make your speech
a little more direct than your brother's.

731
00:56:08,867 --> 00:56:11,506
What will you give me
to set fire to your beard?

732
00:56:39,147 --> 00:56:42,583
We're all right
as long as the water supply holds out.

733
00:56:47,267 --> 00:56:49,462
Please, the radio. Your speech.

734
00:56:55,507 --> 00:56:58,305
They may have to build
a dam in the back of him.

735

They've never been so insulted,
and they refuse to stay.

741
00:57:26,467 --> 00:57:29,823
No, please. Tell them he didn't mean it.

742
00:57:36,907 --> 00:57:39,057
Of course, you know this means war.

743
00:57:40,587 --> 00:57:41,986

00:57:42,067 --> 00:57:44,342

752
00:58:14,227 --> 00:58:18,220
First, I'll throw those two gorillas out.
That goes for you, too.

-Good morning.
-Oh, boy, I'm hungry.

760
00:58:34,107 --> 00:58:36,337
Read that.
That will take away your appetite.

761
00:58:36,907 --> 00:58:39,137
No. That only makes me hungrier.

762
00:58:39,227 --> 00:58:41,946
Come on. You're going to be late for jail.

763
00:58:44,067 --> 00:58:46,137
Those certainly went like hot cakes.

764
00:58:48,187 --> 00:58:50,940
You know, this isn't the way
I anticipated my breakfast.

765
00:58:51,947 --> 00:58:54,097
I'm certainly getting enough of you fellas.

-I no like cupcakes.
-No.

Say, wait a minute.
That was a two-bit cigar.

without eating them.

770

Get out.

771
00:59:11,867 --> 00:59:13,539
Glad I didn't bring my vest.

772
00:59:13,627 --> 00:59:16,619
I forgot to tell you.
He ate your vest last night for dessert.

773
00:59:16,707 --> 00:59:17,696
He's half goat.

774
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:20,506
Yes, and that's giving him
all the best of it.

775
00:59:25,227 --> 00:59:27,218
Thought I had another cigar on me.

776
00:59:32,307 --> 00:59:35,936
He's going to smell Iike a vegetable salad
when he gets through with that.

I've been looking forward to this breakfast.
I've been waiting all morning.

Get out of here before I get arrested.

790

an old clothes man to me.

HENDERSON: Nice place.
OTlS: It's comfortable.

792
01:00:41,027 --> 01:00:42,779
You live here all alone?

793
01:00:43,027 --> 01:00:44,824
Yes. Just me and my memories.

794
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:48,138
-I'm practically a hermit.
-A hermit.

795
01:00:48,827 --> 01:00:50,863
I notice the table is set for four.

796
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:53,063
That's nothing.
My alarm clock is set for 8:00.

797
01:00:53,147 --> 01:00:54,865
That doesn't prove a thing.

798
01:00:54,947 --> 01:00:56,221
A wise guy.

799
01:00:57,307 --> 01:00:59,537
I'll take a little look around.

800
01:01:05,107 --> 01:01:06,665
-Hey, you.
-Coming.

801
01:01:08,027 --> 01:01:10,905
What's a hermit doing with four beds?

802
01:01:11,187 --> 01:01:13,018
-You see those first three beds?
-Yes.

803
01:01:13,107 --> 01:01:15,575
Last night, I counted 5,000 sheep
on those beds.

804
01:01:15,667 --> 01:01:17,020
So I had to have another bed.

805
01:01:17,107 --> 01:01:19,667
You wouldn't want me
to sleep with the sheep, would you?

806
01:01:28,027 --> 01:01:30,302
-Who are you talking to?
-I was talking to myself.

807
01:01:30,387 --> 01:01:31,900
There's nothing you can do about it.

808
01:01:31,987 --> 01:01:35,297
-I've had three of the best doctors.
-I certainly heard somebody talk.

809
01:01:35,387 --> 01:01:37,298
OTlS: It's sheer folly.
HENDERSON: What's this?

810
01:01:37,387 --> 01:01:39,025
OTlS: That's a fire escape.

811
01:01:39,107 --> 01:01:41,063
That's a table. This is a room.

812
01:01:41,147 --> 01:01:43,581
There's the door leading out.
I wish you would use it.

813
01:01:43,667 --> 01:01:46,977
-I want to be alone.
-You'll be alone when I throw you in jail.

814
01:01:47,067 --> 01:01:49,581
OTlS: lsn't there a song like that,
Henderson?

815
01:01:50,747 --> 01:01:52,658
Look out.
He's coming around the other way.

816
01:01:52,747 --> 01:01:54,100
Get inside, quick.

817
01:01:54,947 --> 01:01:57,780
It means a stretch at the big house
if he catches you.

818
01:01:57,867 --> 01:01:59,061
Don't let him catch you.

819
01:01:59,147 --> 01:02:00,421
HENDERSON: Hey, you!
OTlS: Coming.

820
01:02:01,067 --> 01:02:02,705
What became of that fourth bed?

821
01:02:02,787 --> 01:02:04,300
What are you referring to, Colonel?

822
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:07,220
Last time I was in this room,
there were four beds here.

823
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:10,583
Please. I'm not interested
in your private life, Henderson.

824
01:02:10,667 --> 01:02:11,782
[Henderson groans]

825

He's disappeared.
We can't find him anywhere.

You didn't look in the right place.

995
01:12:04,427 --> 01:12:06,861

You'd better say something.

998
01:12:11,267 --> 01:12:12,939

will probably come back in the morning.

1007

Tonight marks the American debut
of Rodolfo Lassparri.

1008

from a very famous family.

spaghetti with bicarbonate of soda...
