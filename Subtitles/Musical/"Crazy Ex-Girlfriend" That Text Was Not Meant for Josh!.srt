00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:42,624
I have to examine just a piece of

189
00:06:42,626 --> 00:06:44,492
essential evidence.

190
00:06:44,494 --> 00:06:45,927

195
00:07:03,513 --> 00:07:07,582

196
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:14,289

204
00:07:35,883 --> 00:07:37,683
I'd like to request a temporary stay

205
00:07:37,685 --> 00:07:38,684
in this matter.

206
00:07:38,686 --> 00:07:40,086
What?

207
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:41,887
Uh, it is an emergency.

208
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:43,923
Your Honor, this is highly unprofessional.

209
00:07:43,925 --> 00:07:44,990
Uh, yeah.

210
00:07:44,992 --> 00:07:46,692
Okay, cookie, you don't have to lie.

211
00:07:46,694 --> 00:07:47,599
These are good people.

212
00:07:47,624 --> 00:07:50,162
I-I've known Harry forever,
I-I mentored Connie.

213
00:07:50,164 --> 00:07:51,030

214
00:07:51,032 --> 00:07:52,098
What? Understand what?

215
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,399
You guys, look at this.

216
00:07:53,401 --> 00:07:54,767
She just accidentally texted

217
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:56,535
her ex-boyfriend from summer camp

218
00:07:56,537 --> 00:07:57,837
who she's secretly in love with,

219
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,271
moved here for...

220
00:07:59,273 --> 00:08:01,540
Oh, and by the way, has a
serious live-in girlfriend.

221
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:03,242
Paula! What...

222
00:08:03,244 --> 00:08:04,543
Oh, my God.

223
00:08:04,725 --> 00:08:06,258
What is this about?

224
00:08:09,264 --> 00:08:11,185
Look, Miss Bunch, I can't grant you a stay.

225
00:08:13,488 --> 00:08:15,988
You gotta take care of this right away.

226
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,523
You take the rest of the day off.

227
00:08:17,525 --> 00:08:19,592
Yes, what can we do to help?

228
00:08:19,594 --> 00:08:20,893

229
00:08:21,762 --> 00:08:22,728
Oh.

230
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,296
Oh, this is a disaster.

231

232

Forget this stupid case,

233
00:08:26,434 --> 00:08:27,900
we've gotta figure out how to spin this.

234
00:08:27,902 --> 00:08:29,568
Vanessa: No, let me see that.

235
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,237
Girl, this is a living nightmare!

236
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:32,304
Judge Spenser: What if
we spin it as a joke?

237
00:08:32,306 --> 00:08:33,305
Oh, ha, ha, ha,

238
00:08:33,307 --> 00:08:34,607
it's opposite day.

239
00:08:34,609 --> 00:08:37,510
No one does opposite day
anymore, Harry, what are we?

240
00:08:37,512 --> 00:08:39,044
Fourth graders in 1995?

241
00:08:39,046 --> 00:08:41,113
Well, I don't know! I'm panicking!

242
00:08:41,115 --> 00:08:43,549
And I'm the only one
brainstorming here, Connie!

243
00:08:43,551 --> 00:08:44,750
Maybe she blames the phone company.

244
00:08:44,752 --> 00:08:46,785
I know! She could say she got hacked.

245
00:08:46,787 --> 00:08:49,889
No. No, there's only one option here.

246
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:51,690
Witness protection.

247
00:08:51,692 --> 00:08:54,360
- Burn it all down. Start a new life.
- Oh, my... come on!

248
00:08:54,362 --> 00:08:56,028
Okay, all right. Everybody just calm down.

249
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,264
We just have to get to his
phone before he sees it.

250
00:08:58,266 --> 00:09:00,966
Ugh, but he's on the
thing all the time. Dammit!

251
00:09:00,968 --> 00:09:02,701
Wait! Oh, my God!

252
00:09:02,703 --> 00:09:03,769
Guys, I just remembered something!

253
00:09:03,771 --> 00:09:05,104
He doesn't have his phone with him.

254
00:09:05,106 --> 00:09:06,505
Yeah, he accidentally left it at home

255
00:09:06,507 --> 00:09:07,673
while he's at Tae Kwan Do.

256
00:09:07,675 --> 00:09:08,841
Tae Kwan Duh!

257
00:09:08,843 --> 00:09:09,975
That is your answer, girl!

258
00:09:09,977 --> 00:09:11,744
Paula: You have got to
get to that apartment.

259
00:09:11,746 --> 00:09:13,078
Wait! What if Velveeta is there?

260
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,580
His girlfriend.

261
00:09:14,582 --> 00:09:15,581
Rebecca: No, no. No.

262
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:16,715
Valencia's not there.

263
00:09:16,717 --> 00:09:18,384
She teaches yoga
back-to-back today,

264
00:09:18,386 --> 00:09:20,186
so I have a window of, like, three hours.

265
00:09:20,188 --> 00:09:21,754
So the first thing we do
when we get to Josh's house

266
00:09:21,756 --> 00:09:23,689
is we look for his spare key.

267
00:09:23,691 --> 00:09:25,324
He got locked out one time and...

268
00:09:25,326 --> 00:09:26,792
I can't go with you.

269
00:09:26,794 --> 00:09:27,526
What?

270
00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:29,061
Yeah, I know!

271
00:09:29,063 --> 00:09:31,063
I'm having dinner with Scott at home.

272
00:09:31,065 --> 00:09:31,730

But it is a big deal.

275

It's like our whole marriage

276
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:38,704
is in a boat and God is
watching or something.

277
00:09:38,706 --> 00:09:39,805
But you go!

278
00:09:39,807 --> 00:09:42,041
Go to his apartment right now!

279
00:09:42,043 --> 00:09:44,210
Connie: Yes! Go as fast as your
tiny little legs will carry you!

280

Go! I'll get you a police escort!

00:16:39,343 --> 00:16:40,342
Okay.

436
00:16:40,344 --> 00:16:43,378
Okay, so someone used a rock

437
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:47,213
and broke into your apartment?

438

Was-was anything taken?

439
00:16:49,653 --> 00:16:51,954
No. No, just the rock through the window.

440
00:16:51,956 --> 00:16:54,089
So I was scared, and I came here,

441
00:16:54,091 --> 00:16:56,440
and the door was unlocked.

442
00:16:56,794 --> 00:16:58,160

444
00:17:00,197 --> 00:17:02,831
(scoffs) Did I leave the fridge open, too?

445
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:06,190
Yes, you did, and I closed it,
and I saved a lot of cold cuts.

446
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:08,670
Geez. Uh, you know what, thank you.

I'm probably overreacting.

just came in your house.

Hi. So, okay, Josh caught
me coming in his house,

503
00:19:14,064 --> 00:19:15,630
and I started panicking,

504
00:19:15,632 --> 00:19:17,165
and I told him that
we'd be good at charades,

505
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:18,533
and now he's being all
protective and masculine...

506
00:19:18,535 --> 00:19:19,901
He smells like karate, and I love it...

507
00:19:19,903 --> 00:19:21,336
And he's getting dressed now,

508
00:19:21,338 --> 00:19:23,405
so what I need you to do is
I need you to go to my house,

509
00:19:23,407 --> 00:19:25,006
stop what you're doing, and throw a rock

Did you say “copy that” to your mom?

513
00:19:32,316 --> 00:19:36,418
Yes, I have to make copies
for her health insurance.

514

Okay, yeah, that's enough.

00:20:47,863 --> 00:20:49,229
First I got to use the bathroom.

548
00:20:49,254 --> 00:20:50,587
You know how my body deals with excitement.

549
00:20:50,927 --> 00:20:52,593
Okay, use the sliding glass
door, it's always open.

550
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:53,859
But hurry up, okay?

551
00:20:53,884 --> 00:20:55,717
Be right back.

552
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,409
(cell phone chimes)

553
00:21:01,725 --> 00:21:03,745
Oh, God, I just need a rock.

554
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,069
I hate Southern California!

555
00:21:05,094 --> 00:21:07,361
No rocks, no dirt, no sticks!

556
00:21:07,386 --> 00:21:09,053
(huffing)

557
00:21:09,078 --> 00:21:10,667
Paula, look.

558
00:21:10,692 --> 00:21:11,924
(gasps)

559
00:21:11,949 --> 00:21:13,782
Oh, my God, babe, it's beautiful.

560
00:21:13,861 --> 00:21:15,227
It's textbook.

561
00:21:15,252 --> 00:21:16,352
It's like the image you get

562
00:21:16,377 --> 00:21:17,743
when you Google the word “rock”"

563
00:21:17,768 --> 00:21:19,668
(chuckles) Now what do we do?

564
00:21:19,693 --> 00:21:20,667
Go, go, go, go, go!

565
00:21:20,692 --> 00:21:21,824
Go, go!

566
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:23,979
Go, go, go, go, go!

567
00:21:24,135 --> 00:21:25,090
Chuck it!

568
00:21:25,115 --> 00:21:26,081
What?

569
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,482
Scott, throw it through the window.

570
00:21:27,484 --> 00:21:28,683
I can't throw it...

571
00:21:28,685 --> 00:21:29,784
Scott, the boat is sinking.

572
00:21:29,786 --> 00:21:32,948
Throw the rock through the widow! (shouts)

573
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:38,293
(dogs barking)

574
00:21:38,295 --> 00:21:39,627
- (laughs)
- (whoops)

575
00:21:39,629 --> 00:21:40,929
I can't believe we did that.

576
00:21:40,931 --> 00:21:42,931
Uh, what else can we break?

577
00:21:42,933 --> 00:21:44,499
Oh, I still got to pee!

578
00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:46,370
(both laughing)

579
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:51,139
So, I just want to let you
know I was thinking about it

580
00:21:51,141 --> 00:21:53,108
in the car and what if the
bad guys felt really bad

581
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,709
about what they'd done
and-and they and they went

582
00:21:54,711 --> 00:21:56,377
and cleaned it up, 'cause I've
heard about that happening.

583
00:21:56,646 --> 00:21:58,737
Oh, my gosh, that's...

584
00:21:58,762 --> 00:21:59,940
I shouldn't be surprised,

585
00:21:59,965 --> 00:22:01,098
because that's the way I left it.

586
00:22:01,123 --> 00:22:02,096
Yeah, that's broken glass.

587
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:03,081
That's a lot of broken glass.

588
00:22:03,106 --> 00:22:04,572
Yeah, that's a legitimate...

589
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:06,056
Wow. It's a legitimate mess.

590
00:22:06,081 --> 00:22:08,088
Well, I mean, this is really creepy.

591
00:22:08,113 --> 00:22:09,512
But at least you're not hurt.

592
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:10,903
That's the most important thing.

593
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:12,440
Is it?

594
00:22:12,761 --> 00:22:13,894
Of course!

595
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,652
You can always replace a door, but,

596
00:22:15,677 --> 00:22:17,543
you know, there's only one Becks.

597
00:22:18,284 --> 00:22:21,807
Oh, well, there's only one Josh Chan.

598
00:22:21,832 --> 00:22:23,698
Actually, there's a lot of Josh Chan’s.

599
00:22:23,723 --> 00:22:24,989
There's one in Azusa.

600
00:22:25,142 --> 00:22:26,620
Yeah, I used to play him in soccer.

601
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,925
(both chuckle)

602
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,493
Wow, um,

603
00:22:29,518 --> 00:22:31,185
I feel

604
00:22:31,415 --> 00:22:33,048
really rattled.

605
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,182
I need some wine.

606
00:22:34,184 --> 00:22:35,316
Do you want some wine?

607
00:22:35,318 --> 00:22:36,451
You know what? Sure.

608
00:22:36,453 --> 00:22:37,786
- Let's do it.
- Great.

609
00:22:37,788 --> 00:22:39,387
Uh, oh, can I have ice in mine?

610
00:22:39,389 --> 00:22:41,523
Yeah, okay, iced wine.

611
00:22:41,525 --> 00:22:43,127
Coming up.

612
00:22:43,247 --> 00:22:45,847
And then we'll clean up some glass.

613
00:22:45,872 --> 00:22:46,905
Okay.

614
00:22:47,064 --> 00:22:48,263
Oh, yeah, here you go.

615
00:22:48,265 --> 00:22:49,364
Let me get that.

616
00:22:49,366 --> 00:22:51,346
Oh, thank you.

617
00:22:51,601 --> 00:22:52,867
Hey, um,

618
00:22:53,182 --> 00:22:55,036
I feel really safe with you here.

619
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:56,271
Thank you.

620
00:22:56,273 --> 00:22:57,354
(scoffs) Of course.

621
00:22:57,379 --> 00:22:58,845
It's the least I can do.

622
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,018
Thank you.

623
00:23:02,012 --> 00:23:04,846
Hey.
You know, I'm thinking out loud.

624
00:23:04,848 --> 00:23:06,881
As-as long as we're having wine...

625
00:23:06,883 --> 00:23:09,317
Oh, cheers, by the way. Eyes.

626
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:10,385
There we go.

627
00:23:10,387 --> 00:23:11,653
Um, I'm pretty hungry.

628
00:23:11,655 --> 00:23:12,854
Do-do you want to get some food?

629
00:23:12,856 --> 00:23:15,245
There's a great fondue place that-that
delivers right around the corner.

630
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,651
Sounds great. I've never had it.

631
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:18,104
Great.

632
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,261
(laughs) God...

633
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,198
You've really just turned
this night around for me.

634
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,081
Ah...

635
00:23:24,106 --> 00:23:25,690
You know, I was so scared

636
00:23:25,745 --> 00:23:27,745
but now, um,

637
00:23:27,747 --> 00:23:29,246
I just feel like a piece of bread

638
00:23:29,248 --> 00:23:30,915
in a warm bath of cheese.

639
00:23:30,917 --> 00:23:32,183
Hmm.

640
00:23:32,185 --> 00:23:33,217
That's fondue.

641
00:23:33,219 --> 00:23:34,251
I'm describing fondue.

642
00:23:34,253 --> 00:23:35,486
Oh, gotcha.

643
00:23:35,488 --> 00:23:37,054
Yeah, I thought it was some kind of soup.

644
00:23:37,056 --> 00:23:38,122
No! I'm sorry.

645
00:23:38,124 --> 00:23:39,724
That was confusing. That was my bad.

646
00:23:39,726 --> 00:23:41,459
(doorbell rings)

647
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,260
Hmm, that's weird. I'm
not expecting anybody.

648
00:23:43,262 --> 00:23:45,696
Oh, it's probably the cops.

649
00:23:45,698 --> 00:23:46,797
Cops... Sorry, hmm?

650
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:47,898
Josh?

651
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,733
You called the cops?

652
00:23:48,735 --> 00:23:49,767
Of course I did.

653
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:50,868
No, no, but Josh, Josh,

654
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,036
J-Josh, you know what they say.

655
00:23:52,038 --> 00:23:53,371
Snitches get stitches.

656
00:23:53,373 --> 00:23:54,905
Come on in, Officer.

657
00:23:54,907 --> 00:23:56,640
I got a call about the attempted burglary?

658
00:23:56,642 --> 00:23:59,043
You know what? The-the
glass is just smashed.

659
00:23:59,045 --> 00:24:00,544
They smashed the whole door.

660
00:24:00,546 --> 00:24:01,912
Don't worry, I'm here now.

661
00:24:01,914 --> 00:24:03,414
And rest assured, ma'am,

662
00:24:03,596 --> 00:24:05,930
I won't stop till I get
to the bottom of this.

663
00:24:06,267 --> 00:24:08,700
(sighs)

664
00:24:12,698 --> 00:24:14,431
When did the incident occur?

665
00:24:14,433 --> 00:24:15,699
You know, no idea.

666
00:24:15,701 --> 00:24:17,167
I, uh, it was like this when I got home.

667
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:19,651
Why didn't you call the police
when you first discovered the window?

668
00:24:19,676 --> 00:24:20,942
I panicked, you know?

669
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,239
I just, I-I-I
freaked out.

670
00:24:22,241 --> 00:24:23,340
And I just, I fled.

671
00:24:23,342 --> 00:24:24,608
“Fled”?

672
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:25,842
Yeah, slow down!

673
00:24:25,844 --> 00:24:27,210
JOSH: Okay, okay, just tell him

674
00:24:27,212 --> 00:24:29,012
what you know, Becks.

675
00:24:29,014 --> 00:24:31,715
She can't follow if you talk too fast.

676
00:24:34,026 --> 00:24:35,051
Okay.

677
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,120
Whew.

678
00:24:37,122 --> 00:24:39,122
So what happened

679
00:24:39,124 --> 00:24:40,757
is my friend, Josh Chan,

680
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:42,948
called you because...

681
00:24:43,695 --> 00:24:45,495
he is so protective of me.

682
00:24:45,497 --> 00:24:47,230
Bless him. But I understand

683
00:24:47,232 --> 00:24:48,732
that this is not really worth your time.

684
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:50,433
And the reason for that

685
00:24:50,435 --> 00:24:51,518
I will go into right now.

686
00:24:51,543 --> 00:24:54,573
All right, as I look at this crime scene,

687
00:24:54,598 --> 00:24:56,456
there appears to be no evidence of theft

688
00:24:56,481 --> 00:25:00,251
or any sign that someone
entered the apartment at all.

689
00:25:00,276 --> 00:25:02,946
Let's take a closer look at
the shards of glass, shall we?

690
00:25:02,948 --> 00:25:05,081
Now, when I look at these shards of glass,

691
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:07,050
there is also no evidence
of secondary compression

692
00:25:07,052 --> 00:25:09,753
by a shoe or shoes, to use the plural.

693
00:25:09,755 --> 00:25:11,555
So I think we can safely say

694
00:25:11,557 --> 00:25:13,056
that no matter what transpired here,

695
00:25:13,058 --> 00:25:15,358
we will never be able to prove a 459.

696
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,660
Josh, that's burglary.

697
00:25:16,662 --> 00:25:18,261
Now, sir, I am a lawyer,

698
00:25:18,263 --> 00:25:19,896
as you might've guessed, and I know,

699
00:25:19,898 --> 00:25:21,398
looking at the glass breakage here,

700
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,466
the most we'll be able to
prove is, uh, maybe a 596?

701
00:25:23,468 --> 00:25:24,768
Josh, that's vandalism.

702
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,503
Now, I know how hard

703
00:25:26,505 --> 00:25:28,305
the officers of this city work.

704
00:25:28,307 --> 00:25:29,839
And the last thing I want

705
00:25:29,841 --> 00:25:31,741
is for you to work on a
bunch of forms tonight.

706
00:25:31,743 --> 00:25:33,743
I mean, those 596 forms,
they're a real bitch.

707
00:25:33,745 --> 00:25:35,545
(chuckles) You're not wrong.

708
00:25:35,547 --> 00:25:36,613
Exactly! I mean,

709
00:25:36,615 --> 00:25:38,615
23 pages for a nonviolent crime?

710
00:25:38,617 --> 00:25:39,916
What do I need... a hobby?

711
00:25:39,918 --> 00:25:40,995
I didn't think so.

712
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,653
So, let's get you out of here.

713
00:25:43,655 --> 00:25:45,555
Let's get you back out on
the streets, Officer Rhodes.

714
00:25:45,557 --> 00:25:47,257
Yeah, sorry, Officer.

715
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:49,392
Or you're welcome to stay for some fondue.

716
00:25:49,394 --> 00:25:50,660
Oh, I wish!

717
00:25:50,662 --> 00:25:51,928
Love those steak cubes.

718
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,697
Wait a minute, I thought it was cheese.

719
00:25:53,699 --> 00:25:56,233
(laughs)

720
00:25:56,235 --> 00:25:57,968
Well, now I really need some wine.

721
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,436
Oh, my God. Me, too.

722
00:25:59,438 --> 00:26:01,071
Hand it over.

723
00:26:01,073 --> 00:26:03,039
Ah, now where were we?

724
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:04,441
Oh, right.

725
00:26:04,443 --> 00:26:07,043
Cheers.

726
00:26:07,045 --> 00:26:08,411
(laughs)

727
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:09,946
You were great back there.

728
00:26:09,948 --> 00:26:11,214
No, you were.

729
00:26:11,216 --> 00:26:12,716
Mm-mm. You saved the day.

730
00:26:12,718 --> 00:26:14,294
I never committed a crime before.

731
00:26:14,682 --> 00:26:16,052
Why did I commit a crime again?

732
00:26:16,054 --> 00:26:18,021
We said no questions, remember?

733
00:26:18,023 --> 00:26:20,257
Aw, come on, tell me, please?

734
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:21,658
No.

735
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,960
Gonna have to try and get it out of me.

736
00:26:24,237 --> 00:26:25,028
Oh.

737
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,823
Where do you keep your answers?

738
00:26:26,848 --> 00:26:28,982
(laughs)

739
00:26:32,944 --> 00:26:34,361
I'm sorry.

740
00:26:35,939 --> 00:26:38,306
I know I've been distant lately and...

741
00:26:38,823 --> 00:26:42,312
it's not just because
I almost had an affair

742
00:26:42,314 --> 00:26:45,456
with a hunky industrial real
estate tycoon from Tucson.

743
00:26:46,065 --> 00:26:46,995
What?

744
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,832
It's a long story and nothing happened.

745
00:26:50,085 --> 00:26:51,768
It was just jazz.

746
00:26:52,257 --> 00:26:53,573
Wow, huh.

747
00:26:54,026 --> 00:26:56,026
Well, then I feel a lot
better about the fact

748
00:26:56,028 --> 00:26:57,727
that I almost slept
with Misty from shipping.

749
00:26:57,729 --> 00:26:59,195
Misty?

750
00:26:59,197 --> 00:27:00,659
Really?

751
00:27:01,307 --> 00:27:02,499
You know, I can see that.

752
00:27:02,501 --> 00:27:03,533
She has slut face.

753
00:27:03,535 --> 00:27:04,487
(smacks tongue)

754
00:27:04,661 --> 00:27:05,478
God!

755
00:27:05,893 --> 00:27:07,226
Father Brah's right.

756
00:27:07,306 --> 00:27:08,972
We've both been major holes, huh?

757
00:27:08,974 --> 00:27:10,907
God. we really have!

758
00:27:10,909 --> 00:27:12,542
I am so sorry.

759
00:27:12,544 --> 00:27:14,034
I don't want another man.

760
00:27:14,246 --> 00:27:16,913
I mean, the only thing I've
been cheating on you with

761
00:27:16,915 --> 00:27:17,979
is...

762
00:27:18,711 --> 00:27:20,651
Rebecca's love life.

763
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,019
She's so in love,

764
00:27:23,021 --> 00:27:24,654
and it-it's just been so intoxicating

765
00:27:24,656 --> 00:27:26,790
to witness it in its purest form.

766
00:27:26,792 --> 00:27:29,807
I'm... I'm addicted.

767
00:27:30,338 --> 00:27:31,728
Who's she in love with?

768
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,197
You really want to know?

769
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:35,365
Yes, I do.

770
00:27:35,367 --> 00:27:37,065
And we got nothing but time right now.

771
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,151
Okay.

772
00:27:40,038 --> 00:27:42,005
Well, what happened was

773
00:27:42,182 --> 00:27:44,374
she was working hard at a New York job

774
00:27:44,376 --> 00:27:46,576
making dough, but it made her blue.

775
00:27:46,578 --> 00:27:48,111
One day, she was crying a lot,

776
00:27:48,113 --> 00:27:51,881
and so she decided to move
to West Covina, California.

777
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,783
Brand new pals, new career.

778
00:27:53,785 --> 00:27:56,479
It happens to be where Josh lives. Ah.

779
00:27:56,565 --> 00:27:59,122
And that's exactly why she's here.

780
00:27:59,124 --> 00:28:01,925
(laughs) She's a crazy ex-girlfriend.

781
00:28:01,927 --> 00:28:03,126
Wha... ? No, she's not.

782
00:28:03,128 --> 00:28:04,394
She's a crazy ex-girlfriend.

783
00:28:04,396 --> 00:28:05,628
That's a sexist term, Scott.

784
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,163
She's a crazy ex-girlfriend.

785
00:28:07,165 --> 00:28:08,765
Okay, just stop talking for a second.

786
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:10,333
She's so broken inside.

787
00:28:10,335 --> 00:28:12,502
This situation has a lot
more nuance than that.

788
00:28:12,504 --> 00:28:14,037
C-R-A-Z-Y!

789
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:15,627
I know how to spell, Scott.

790
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,885
She's a crazy ex-girlfriend.

791
00:28:18,033 --> 00:28:19,659
_

792
00:28:20,912 --> 00:28:23,413
Wow, good thing you brought those gloves.

793
00:28:23,415 --> 00:28:25,648
Oh, yeah, I've got gloves
for every situation.

794
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,818
I mean, cleaning, baseball,

795
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,387
golfing,

796
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:33,123
uh, driving, go-karts, boxing.

797
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:35,120
(laughs) You have all the gloves.

798
00:28:36,061 --> 00:28:37,827
No way.

799
00:28:37,829 --> 00:28:39,129
Is that what I think it is?

800
00:28:39,131 --> 00:28:40,597
Oh, my gosh, what? Is it, like, a penny?

801
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:41,631
The rock they threw

802
00:28:41,633 --> 00:28:43,323
in the window.

803
00:28:43,734 --> 00:28:45,768
Wow, it's, like, a perfect rock.

804
00:28:45,871 --> 00:28:48,071

look like my rock.

829
00:30:12,702 --> 00:30:14,034
That's weird.

830
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,804
Someone threw a rock

831
00:30:16,806 --> 00:30:19,305
from inside the house...

832
00:30:20,466 --> 00:30:22,188
into your house?

833
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:26,040
So, I think I know what happened.

834
00:30:26,042 --> 00:30:28,476
So, the burglar came into the house

835
00:30:28,478 --> 00:30:31,133
to steal something, but because
I live a very simple life,

836
00:30:31,158 --> 00:30:32,406
he didn't find anything to steal.

837
00:30:32,454 --> 00:30:35,420
And in a fit of rage, the
burglar was furthermore

838
00:30:35,445 --> 00:30:37,128
offended, you know, by the platitudinous

839
00:30:37,153 --> 00:30:38,352
inspirational phrases

840
00:30:38,354 --> 00:30:40,521
of my rocks because he's had a hard life...

841
00:30:40,523 --> 00:30:41,664
You know, in order to be a burglar,

842
00:30:41,689 --> 00:30:42,664
you would've had to had a hard life.

843
00:30:42,689 --> 00:30:45,049
So-so then in anger, he
grabbed one of the rocks

844
00:30:45,074 --> 00:30:46,940
and went outside and just to stick it to me

845
00:30:47,091 --> 00:30:48,657
threw it through the window.

846
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:50,727
What-what-what you're talking
about doesn't make any sense.

847
00:30:50,752 --> 00:30:52,953
None of this makes sense.

848
00:30:52,978 --> 00:30:54,055
Okay, you're right.

849
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,480
There's got to be another
explanation, so let...

850
00:30:55,505 --> 00:30:56,871
Please, please don't explain.

851
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,128
I don't want to know.

852
00:30:58,153 --> 00:30:59,653
I don't want to know what happened tonight.

853
00:30:59,678 --> 00:31:00,617
And I really don't want to know

854
00:31:00,642 --> 00:31:02,789
why you were in my apartment before.

855
00:31:03,563 --> 00:31:05,029
Uh, I got to go.

856
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:06,030
What? No.

857
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:07,632
Yeah, I got an early day tomorrow.

858
00:31:07,634 --> 00:31:09,834
Josh, I love y...

859
00:31:13,734 --> 00:31:17,008
I love that you came to my...
rescue tonight.

Josh. Josh, I'm sorry...

864
00:31:38,848 --> 00:31:40,969
You ordered the extra large double dipper?

865
00:31:41,722 --> 00:31:43,255
The... uh, yeah.

866
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,704
I've got two sets of sticks.

867
00:31:46,706 --> 00:31:48,439
It'll just take me a minute to set up.

868
00:31:48,441 --> 00:31:50,441
We threw in some strawberries and chocolate

869
00:31:50,443 --> 00:31:52,047
for that extra bit of romance.

870
00:31:53,102 --> 00:31:54,479
It's all ruined.

871
00:31:54,481 --> 00:31:56,114
People think that, but actually

874

that would really help.

875
00:32:00,949 --> 00:32:03,750
Moments ago, he held me in his arms.

876
00:32:04,891 --> 00:32:06,336
And then just now, he could

877
00:32:06,727 --> 00:32:08,627
barely look me in the eye.

Whoa.

931
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:31,129
What happened?

932
00:35:35,777 --> 00:35:37,377
Rebecca, what's wrong? Are you okay?

933
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:38,868
No, I'm not.

934
00:35:38,893 --> 00:35:40,459
Do you want to tell me what happened?

935
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:42,520
No.

936
00:35:43,276 --> 00:35:44,442
Let me help you.

937
00:35:44,444 --> 00:35:45,510
What can I do?

938
00:35:45,512 --> 00:35:48,813
Come on, let's get this mess cleaned up and
you can tell me what happened. I'll just...

939
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:51,649
Just leave it, I'll get it later.

940
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:53,918
Can you just stay with me

941
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,952
for a little while?

942
00:35:55,231 --> 00:35:57,855
I... I can't be alone right now.

943
00:35:58,762 --> 00:36:00,091
Okay.

944
00:36:00,093 --> 00:36:01,426
(sighs)

945
00:36:01,428 --> 00:36:02,747
Thank you.

946
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:04,762
We don't have to stand here.

947
00:36:04,764 --> 00:36:06,564
We can, like, watch TV, you know...

948
00:36:06,566 --> 00:36:08,253
TV, yeah, sure. Whatever you want.

949
00:36:08,278 --> 00:36:11,279
Let's just, get this mess cleaned up first.

950
00:36:11,304 --> 00:36:12,703
Okay.

951
00:36:14,453 --> 00:36:15,489
Thank you.

952
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:17,742
Are you hungry?

953
00:36:17,744 --> 00:36:18,987
Have you eaten?

954
00:36:19,012 --> 00:36:22,814
I have some... fondue
that's clumping together.

955
00:36:22,816 --> 00:36:24,817
Actually, I am pretty hungry.

956
00:36:25,251 --> 00:36:27,752
Coagulating cheese would
really hit the spot.

957
00:36:27,754 --> 00:36:28,553
(snorts)

958
00:36:28,555 --> 00:36:30,888
(laughs)

959
00:36:31,491 --> 00:36:33,028
Thank you, Greg.

960
00:36:34,188 --> 00:36:36,856
Somehow, you're always
here when I need you.

961
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:50,308
I...

962
00:36:54,118 --> 00:36:55,153
Huh.

963
00:36:55,949 --> 00:36:57,715
That has Josh's name on it.

964
00:36:58,825 --> 00:37:00,084
That makes sense.

965
00:37:00,086 --> 00:37:02,253
He was barely here. I mean,
he didn't even eat his food.

966
00:37:02,255 --> 00:37:03,554
And there are two wine glasses,

967
00:37:03,556 --> 00:37:04,589
one with ice cubes.

968
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:05,656
Classic Chan move.

969
00:37:05,658 --> 00:37:07,158
So you were having another cozy date

970
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,392
with Valencia's boyfriend and...

971
00:37:08,394 --> 00:37:09,694
Oh, my God, that's not what happened.

972
00:37:09,696 --> 00:37:11,062
... you guys had some kind of scene,

973
00:37:11,064 --> 00:37:12,330
somehow a window broke

974
00:37:12,332 --> 00:37:13,698
and look who's cleaning it up?

975
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,601
I'm literally holding a
dustpan and a broom in my hand,

976
00:37:16,603 --> 00:37:17,935
cleaning up your mess.

977
00:37:17,937 --> 00:37:18,903
Why are you mad at me?

978
00:37:18,905 --> 00:37:21,239
I'm not mad at you, I'm mad at myself.

979
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:23,708
(sighs)

980
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:26,403
There are other ways to
get out of this building

981
00:37:27,213 --> 00:37:29,380
but I walked by your patio.

982
00:37:30,824 --> 00:37:33,021
And my girlfriend is 20
feet through that wall,

983
00:37:33,305 --> 00:37:34,825
and I'm standing here.

984
00:37:37,116 --> 00:37:38,278
I gotta go.

985
00:37:39,626 --> 00:37:40,872
Please, Greg...

986
00:37:42,106 --> 00:37:44,428
I just want someone to be here with me.

987
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,463
Right.

988
00:37:45,465 --> 00:37:46,664
“Someone.”

989
00:37:46,807 --> 00:37:48,349
That's the problem.

990
00:37:49,082 --> 00:37:50,692
Feel better, Bunch.

991
00:37:57,059 --> 00:37:58,543
SCOTT: So she's not into Greg?

992
00:37:58,545 --> 00:38:01,712
No, not at all, but he is really into her,

993
00:38:01,714 --> 00:38:03,080
so they keep getting drawn together.

994
00:38:03,082 --> 00:38:04,315
But from what you've said,

995
00:38:04,317 --> 00:38:05,516
they might make a good couple.

996
00:38:05,518 --> 00:38:07,118
Maybe she should give him a chance.

997
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,021
No! Honey, keep your
eyes on the prize, okay?

998
00:38:10,023 --> 00:38:12,023
Rebecca and Josh have an epic and pure love

999
00:38:12,025 --> 00:38:13,724
that spans decades and mountains.

1000
00:38:13,726 --> 00:38:15,693
Good point, she did admit she loved Josh

1001
00:38:15,695 --> 00:38:16,861
after the bus trip.

1002
00:38:16,863 --> 00:38:18,095
(gasps) Yes!

1003
00:38:18,097 --> 00:38:19,363
Very good!

1004
00:38:19,365 --> 00:38:21,766
Oh, did I tell you about
how I got her invited

1005
00:38:21,768 --> 00:38:23,734
to Josh's parents' house for Thanksgiving?

1006
00:38:23,736 --> 00:38:25,036
Was that when she got
the kiss on the cheek?

1007
00:38:25,124 --> 00:38:26,456
Oh...

1008
00:38:26,481 --> 00:38:28,521
No, no, no, no, that was
when they went to the camp.

1009
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,247
God, it's so sexy when you listen.

1010
00:38:39,152 --> 00:38:40,818
(laughing)

1011
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:48,192
Thought I might find you here,

1012
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:51,223
having your morning mocha loco.

1013
00:38:51,389 --> 00:38:54,008
So... what happened?

1014
00:38:54,033 --> 00:38:55,199
You never called me back.

1015
00:38:55,201 --> 00:38:56,467
I called you, like, 50 times.

1016
00:38:56,469 --> 00:38:58,402
I mean, did Josh just leave

1017
00:38:58,404 --> 00:39:00,044
or is he on his way?

1018
00:39:02,098 --> 00:39:03,574
Honey, what happened?

1019
00:39:03,576 --> 00:39:05,153
I, um...

1020
00:39:05,549 --> 00:39:07,333
I ruined everything, Paula.

1021
00:39:07,981 --> 00:39:10,872
Like... it was a disaster.

1022
00:39:12,085 --> 00:39:14,785
You can't even imagine how bad it was.

1023
00:39:14,787 --> 00:39:16,354
Well, how? I mean, we got the rock

1024
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:17,555
through the window before you got home.

1025
00:39:17,557 --> 00:39:18,889
I don't want to talk about it.

1026
00:39:18,891 --> 00:39:19,890
That's how bad it is.

1027
00:39:19,892 --> 00:39:21,092
I-I...

1028
00:39:21,094 --> 00:39:22,727
I just don't even want to talk about it.

1029
00:39:22,729 --> 00:39:24,317
Just... okay.

1030
00:39:24,657 --> 00:39:25,949
(exhales)

1031
00:39:26,432 --> 00:39:28,520
I ruined everything.

1032
00:39:29,769 --> 00:39:31,708
Because that's what I do.

1033
00:39:32,171 --> 00:39:34,171
I ruin things. Okay.

1034
00:39:34,173 --> 00:39:35,139
So that's what happened.

1035
00:39:35,141 --> 00:39:36,274
Okay. Okay.

1036
00:39:36,276 --> 00:39:38,409
Hey... I don't know what happened,

1037
00:39:38,411 --> 00:39:40,878
and we do not have to talk about it. Now.

1038
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,148
I mean, clearly I'm going
to need all the deets later.

1039
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,283
- Paula...
- But you are... hey.

1040
00:39:45,285 --> 00:39:46,884
You are not a ruin-er.

1041
00:39:47,169 --> 00:39:48,686
Okay, do you hear me?

1042
00:39:48,688 --> 00:39:50,621
You are the opposite.
You're a-a put-together-er.

1043
00:39:50,623 --> 00:39:52,657
Paula, you don't know
what you're talking about,

1044
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:54,091
and it doesn't even make sense.

1045
00:39:54,093 --> 00:39:56,590
Oh, okay, you want to know
what you put together-ered?

1046
00:39:56,911 --> 00:39:58,527
My marriage.

1047
00:39:58,564 --> 00:40:00,464
- What?
- Yes!

1048
00:40:00,466 --> 00:40:03,501
I mean, who knew a little
vandalism would be, like,

1049
00:40:03,503 --> 00:40:07,104
the most amazing foreplay we had ever had?!

1050
00:40:07,223 --> 00:40:09,540
I mean, look at this text from Scott.

1051
00:40:09,542 --> 00:40:11,208
I mean, look at all these emojis.

1052
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,210
He sent me, like, a unicorn and a panda.

1053
00:40:13,212 --> 00:40:15,546
- Hmm.
- And, like, 11 different kinds of hearts.

1054
00:40:15,548 --> 00:40:17,381
Oh. (laughing)

1055
00:40:17,383 --> 00:40:19,383
Oh, no, no, don't scroll there. Oh. Whoa.

1056
00:40:19,385 --> 00:40:20,584
Yeah. Okay. Wow.

1057
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:22,320
Sorry. I'm sorry you had to see that.

1058
00:40:22,322 --> 00:40:26,157
No. You... you go.

1059
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:28,169
Okay, but listen to me.

1060
00:40:28,895 --> 00:40:30,761
You and Josh... You're on a journey.

1061
00:40:30,763 --> 00:40:32,530
Okay? So there's gonna be peaks,

1062
00:40:32,532 --> 00:40:34,332
but there's also gonna be valleys.

1063
00:40:34,334 --> 00:40:38,169
And yes, maybe even a
long, dry, flat plateau

1064
00:40:38,171 --> 00:40:39,937
called “my-kids-are-little,
don't-touch-me”"

1065
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:44,375
But the valleys are gonna
make those peaks even sweeter.

1066
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:47,981
So... take a deep breath.

1067
00:40:52,059 --> 00:40:54,356
Look how beautiful it is today.

1068
00:40:54,787 --> 00:40:59,290
And know that everything is gonna be okay.

1069
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:03,559
And if it's not, we will make it okay.

1070
00:41:04,532 --> 00:41:06,192
I promise you.

1071
00:41:08,848 --> 00:41:10,134
Are you sure?

1072
00:41:11,325 --> 00:41:12,513
We will find a way.

1073
00:41:13,106 --> 00:41:14,505
Come here.

1074
00:41:14,507 --> 00:41:16,676
I swear.

1075
00:41:18,975 --> 00:41:21,442
I think I have a UTI.

1076
00:41:24,153 --> 00:41:27,418
Harry, did you okay a
police escort to get a woman

1077
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,953
to her ex-boyfriend's house faster?

1078
00:41:28,955 --> 00:41:30,821
Yes, sir, but you have to understand...

1079
00:41:30,823 --> 00:41:33,190
Judge Spenser, that's an
unnecessary expenditure,

1080
00:41:33,192 --> 00:41:35,590
not to mention you put
our citizens at risk.

1081
00:41:35,615 --> 00:41:37,361
But sir, it was urgent.

1082
00:41:37,363 --> 00:41:39,006
It was a text-mergency.

1083
00:41:39,629 --> 00:41:41,232
You mean a text-tastrophe?

1084
00:41:41,234 --> 00:41:42,739
Is that what caught on?

1085
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,236
It figures.

1086
00:41:45,888 --> 00:41:47,020
Damn it!

1087
00:41:47,022 --> 00:41:49,036
Judge Spenser,
why are you getting so upset?
