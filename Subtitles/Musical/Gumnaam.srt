1
00:00:44,204 --> 00:00:46,071
Mr Sohanlal!

2
00:00:46,605 --> 00:00:48,171
Inform the police.
Go on!

3
00:01:28,442 --> 00:01:31,676
This is Khanna speaking.
The work is done.

4
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:34,576
You must keep another
death certificate ready.

5
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:49,278
Send the will to
its rightful place.

6
00:02:02,846 --> 00:02:06,579
The will shall reach you
by morning. Do the needful.

7
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:30,082
Dear Asha, your uncle
has met with an accident.

8
00:02:30,615 --> 00:02:31,782
And he is dead.

9
00:02:32,015 --> 00:02:34,882
No! It can't be true!

10
00:02:35,649 --> 00:02:38,049
This is true.

11
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,183
My heartfelt condolences
are with you...

12
00:02:42,616 --> 00:02:43,383
You?

13
00:09:29,124 --> 00:09:33,324
Today is the Silver Jubilee
of the Princess Club.

14
00:09:33,857 --> 00:09:35,424
On this joyous occasion...

15
00:09:35,691 --> 00:09:38,625
the club has presented you
with a variety of programmes.

16
00:09:39,058 --> 00:09:42,625
But the most interesting programme
will be presented now.

17
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:53,826
We now present the winners
of the lucky draw.

18
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,727
The winners will be sent abroad
on a chartered flight...

19
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,927
on a 2-week complimentary
holidary abroad.

20
00:10:05,861 --> 00:10:07,427
Here are their names.

21
00:10:09,294 --> 00:10:10,428
Barrister Rakesh!

22
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:14,928
Mr Dharamdas!

23
00:10:17,295 --> 00:10:18,462
Mr Kishan!

24
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:23,129
Miss Kitty!

25
00:10:27,163 --> 00:10:28,763
Dr Acharya!

26
00:10:32,897 --> 00:10:34,630
Mr Madhusudan Sharma!

27
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,431
And Miss Asha.

28
00:10:43,864 --> 00:10:46,598
They are the seven
lucky winners...

29
00:10:46,798 --> 00:10:48,532
who leave for a foreign holiday.

30
00:10:48,665 --> 00:10:54,632
I hope this is the best
vacation of their life.

31
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:32,536
This is Captain Bhatia
speaking to you.

32
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:36,536
Due to a technical snag in the
engine, we will have to force-land.

33
00:11:39,303 --> 00:11:41,337
Do not panic and
fasten your seat belts.

34
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,537
We are doing our best
to land safely.

35
00:12:44,276 --> 00:12:46,943
It will take us 2 hours
to repair the engine.

36
00:12:47,077 --> 00:12:49,044
You can take a stroll
till then, if you wish.

37
00:13:02,678 --> 00:13:03,745
It's a nice place.

38
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:06,645
What if they can't
fix the engine?

39
00:13:06,812 --> 00:13:09,046
Well...? - How will we go?

40
00:13:09,312 --> 00:13:10,946
We've had to force land
because of the snag.

41
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:12,546
We will leave, once it is repaired.

42
00:13:57,884 --> 00:13:59,451
I have nothing to do with this.

43
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:02,151
I know nothing.

44
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,754
It's very late.
And Anand hasn't returned yet.

45
00:14:33,087 --> 00:14:34,954
We've been wandering around
for so very long.

46
00:14:35,488 --> 00:14:38,921
When we couldn't find a place
to live in, how can he?

47
00:14:39,355 --> 00:14:42,155
Even if he does find a place,
do you think he'll return?

48
00:14:42,688 --> 00:14:46,622
Why don't you believe me!
Anand is responsible for all this.

49
00:14:47,489 --> 00:14:49,056
We will soon know.

50
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:53,056
There he is!

51
00:14:54,156 --> 00:14:59,757
Any success?
- No. No trace of human life.

52
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:05,357
What shall we do now?
- Rest.

53
00:15:05,491 --> 00:15:08,558
Let's leave it to the one
who brought us this far.

54
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:10,958
By then I'll starve to death.
I'm so very thirsty.

55
00:15:11,191 --> 00:15:15,758
Then drink this.
- God! You want to corrupt me!

56
00:15:17,092 --> 00:15:20,559
You're joking instead of
finding some shelter!

57
00:15:20,692 --> 00:15:23,759
In this dangerous jungle...
- You folks are far more dangerous.

58
00:15:24,292 --> 00:15:26,159
Sit here.
I'm leaving on my own.

59
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:31,760
Don't worry.
She'll return on her own.

60
00:21:51,931 --> 00:21:54,998
Has the entire
entourage arrived?

61
00:21:55,132 --> 00:21:58,999
I've been waiting for you
for a whole a week.

62
00:21:59,365 --> 00:22:01,399
Which means you knew about
our arrival.

63
00:22:01,932 --> 00:22:05,066
Old man, what nonsense
are you talking?

64
00:22:05,266 --> 00:22:07,799
Who else but you
could've arrived?

65
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:12,267
I've made all the
arrangements for you.

66
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:14,967
Arrangements?
Who are you?

67
00:22:16,734 --> 00:22:23,801
I'm the cook.
I am the butler.

68
00:22:23,934 --> 00:22:25,401
And shall take care of
all your comforts.

69
00:22:26,735 --> 00:22:29,402
Come, doctor.
- Wait!

70
00:22:29,935 --> 00:22:32,602
How did you know I'm a doctor?
- I'm not a fool.

71
00:22:33,135 --> 00:22:37,369
Well, Mr Sharma?
- You know my name too.

72
00:22:37,536 --> 00:22:43,003
I know everyone. You are
Mr. Sharma and she's Ms. Kitty.

73
00:22:43,936 --> 00:22:47,003
Aren't I right?
And he is Mr. Dharamdas.

74
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:51,004
He is omniscient.
Is he human or a ghost?

75
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,104
Why are you so apprehensive?

76
00:22:55,938 --> 00:22:57,904
This note contains everything.

77
00:22:58,738 --> 00:23:01,105
Why are you snatching it?
It doesn't include your name.

78
00:23:01,271 --> 00:23:02,705
So tell me your name.

79
00:23:05,139 --> 00:23:07,805
I'll make arrangements
for you too.

80
00:23:08,339 --> 00:23:11,006
Where will you, now that
you are here? Follow me!

81
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:30,708
C'mon upstairs!
What are you doing there?

82
00:23:35,942 --> 00:23:38,208
They all seem nice and healthy.

83
00:23:38,975 --> 00:23:40,609
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

84
00:23:40,742 --> 00:23:42,709
And now the eighth one too.

85
00:23:47,543 --> 00:23:49,410
I'll have to make arrangements
for him too.

86
00:24:30,747 --> 00:24:35,481
Why are you staring at me? Haven't
you ever seen a handsome man?

87
00:24:36,348 --> 00:24:38,215
All said and done,
he's an interesting man.

88
00:24:39,248 --> 00:24:41,115
He has taken care of
all our comforts.

89
00:24:41,281 --> 00:24:42,715
There are enough of
groceries too.

90
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,415
Mr. Sharma, do you intend to make
us stay here all our lives?

91
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:47,015
My intentions differ slightly.

92
00:24:47,582 --> 00:24:51,016
Now stop arguing,
and start eating.

93
00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:55,016
Get some mutton for me.
- Tomatoes and green chillis for me.

94
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,217
Listen... bring vegetables for me.
- Okay.

95
00:24:59,783 --> 00:25:01,417
Bring yogurt for me.
- Okay.

96
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:06,217
Do you have some pickle?
- Only bitter gourd. I'll get it.

97
00:25:09,151 --> 00:25:12,285
I think we must help him.
- Sure.

98
00:25:13,385 --> 00:25:16,618
Each one has a different choice...
chicken and mutton indeed!

99
00:25:19,152 --> 00:25:20,319
I'm confused.

100
00:25:24,352 --> 00:25:27,019
One wants raw tomatoes another
asks for tomato sauce.

101
00:25:35,154 --> 00:25:38,221
If I'm not mistaken,
you are Mr. Sohanlal's niece?

102
00:25:38,487 --> 00:25:43,021
Yes... but what makes you ask?
- Only casually.

103
00:25:45,688 --> 00:25:50,222
The food is delicious and you
are a fun person too.

104
00:25:50,355 --> 00:25:53,422
Madame, do you want to
devour me too?

105
00:25:54,489 --> 00:25:58,223
Who's interested in living anyway?
- Then why don't you die?

106
00:25:59,556 --> 00:26:01,423
What is this?
An account of the spices?

107
00:26:01,556 --> 00:26:02,723
Where are the vegetables?

108
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,725
What are you reading so intently?

109
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:21,425
This dairy bears the names
of the travellers...

110
00:26:21,958 --> 00:26:24,325
who have reached the end
of their lives.

111
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:28,626
This is for those who were
strangers to each other...

112
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:31,526
but now are companions in
this last journey of life.

113
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,827
By now, you must've realised...

114
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,227
that you are all victims
of a conspiracy.

115
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,927
Do you recollect that someone was
a victim of your conspiracy too?

116
00:26:46,227 --> 00:26:51,028
All of you have been deliberately
brought together today.

117
00:26:51,561 --> 00:26:54,695
You are all murderers,
criminals and culprits.

118
00:26:55,162 --> 00:26:58,229
And you've been brought here
to be punished.

119
00:26:59,162 --> 00:27:04,296
And the punishment is death
for all of you, but in turns.

120
00:27:05,163 --> 00:27:07,829
What nonsense is this?
- Don't kick up a fuss.

121
00:27:08,363 --> 00:27:12,030
It won't help. There is no way
you can escape this ordeal.

122
00:27:12,363 --> 00:27:15,030
Just as you smilingly
committed the crime...

123
00:27:15,164 --> 00:27:17,897
so also you must accept
the punishment smilingly.

124
00:27:18,097 --> 00:27:20,064
We won't tolerate empty threats.

125
00:27:20,631 --> 00:27:23,031
Who is behind this conspiracy?

126
00:27:23,564 --> 00:27:25,131
Why doesn't he face us?

127
00:28:08,769 --> 00:28:12,636
Does anyone else stay here too?
- How would I know? Could be.

128
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:17,436
Who was singing this song?
- Maybe my mother!

129
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:23,037
Put the knife away. That song
is coming out of my ears.

130
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:29,438
This is the hit song of the hamlet
and is heard every where.

131
00:28:29,671 --> 00:28:33,138
As if there is a wandering
soul in this hamlet.

132
00:28:33,305 --> 00:28:35,538
What?
- Who else will stay here?

133
00:28:35,738 --> 00:28:38,239
I don't believe this.
He must be lying.

134
00:28:38,772 --> 00:28:42,239
Someone must be staying here.
- Madame, today is the first night.

135
00:28:42,372 --> 00:28:44,639
You will understand everything
by and by

136
00:28:46,773 --> 00:28:48,640
Atleast finish your meal.

137
00:28:49,173 --> 00:28:51,040
Hearing of spirits makes
them lose their appetite.

138
00:28:51,173 --> 00:28:53,140
If they encounter a live spirit
they'll die!

139
00:28:53,407 --> 00:28:55,040
You seem to be quite smart.

140
00:28:57,174 --> 00:29:00,641
Since they've wasted all this,
I'll feed them for breakfast.

141
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:29,444
I've told you, Rake.
I like alcoholics but not alcohol.

142
00:29:33,177 --> 00:29:35,544
Why'd I force you
to drink?

143
00:29:35,878 --> 00:29:40,345
This is something which is offered
willingly and had willingly, too.

144
00:29:40,611 --> 00:29:43,845
Isn't it, darling? I'm sorry to
address you as darling, darling.

145
00:29:44,078 --> 00:29:45,545
That doesn't mean I'm drunk.

146
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,446
Your eyes intoxicated me,
otherwise I'm quite sober.

147
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,846
Have a sip.
- Please listen to me.

148
00:29:52,379 --> 00:29:54,746
Okay, I'll drink it myself.

149
00:29:55,013 --> 00:29:59,547
Just come over, if you're scared.
I'm in the room next door.

150
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:05,914
Why should I be scared? The protector
is scared, not the destroyer.

151
00:30:06,381 --> 00:30:07,847
What can anyone steal from me?

152
00:30:08,381 --> 00:30:11,048
Don't say that... they could
do so much to you, darling!

153
00:30:11,281 --> 00:30:13,415
There! I've got used to
calling you darling.

154
00:32:02,792 --> 00:32:05,159
Open the door slowly.
- I can't help it, sir.

155
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:09,460
If I work slowly,
how will I finish my work?

156
00:32:13,993 --> 00:32:17,460
Sir, what is this?
- This is a "doorbin" (binocular).

157
00:32:17,594 --> 00:32:19,861
"Been"? (a pipe)
Let me use it to charm snakes.

158
00:32:19,994 --> 00:32:23,061
This is used to see
faraway things closely.

159
00:32:23,194 --> 00:32:25,461
Oh, I see. Can you see
the pavements of Secunderabad?

160
00:32:26,261 --> 00:32:29,162
Prepare me a cup of tea.
- No, sir. I bring the tea.

161
00:32:29,328 --> 00:32:31,562
It's for you to make it...
That's all!

162
00:32:49,197 --> 00:32:53,131
Give me a call...
I'm young at heart!

163
00:32:54,164 --> 00:32:57,964
Where are you, Madame?
- I am here.

164
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:01,165
How will I talk to you if you
remain standing in there?

165
00:33:01,298 --> 00:33:04,665
Come out and see, I've brought
a cup of hot tea for you.

166
00:33:05,199 --> 00:33:06,765
Come before it gets cold.

167
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:14,733
What is it?
- How much of sugar, Madame?

168
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,767
I don't want tea now.
I'm going for a swim.

169
00:33:18,933 --> 00:33:20,667
What?
- For a swim.

170
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,067
Do you intend to swim
across the ocean?

171
00:33:25,201 --> 00:33:29,934
Everyone wants me to prepare
some tea for them; but I refuse.

172
00:33:30,501 --> 00:33:32,668
And she refuses me!

173
00:33:34,801 --> 00:33:36,368
Are you going for a swim?

174
00:33:43,202 --> 00:33:45,469
A pain, sir?
Then drink some tea.

175
00:33:46,003 --> 00:33:48,370
Instead of tea, bring me
some fresh lime-water.

176
00:33:48,536 --> 00:33:51,070
Do you suffer a hangover?
- You are very smart.

177
00:34:05,605 --> 00:34:07,871
Are you going for a swim?
- Yes.

178
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:09,472
Go ahead!
I too will join you later.

179
00:34:09,605 --> 00:34:13,139
You are fond of swimming and
I love catching things that swim.

180
00:34:13,605 --> 00:34:16,672
I mean fishing.
- Then come on.

181
00:34:31,907 --> 00:34:35,874
How she walks!
- And how are you?

182
00:34:38,275 --> 00:34:41,475
Is breakfast ready?
- What a hog!

183
00:34:41,608 --> 00:34:43,875
Didn't you get your fill
ogling at her?

184
00:34:44,008 --> 00:34:45,442
Go and get my breakfast.

185
00:34:45,609 --> 00:34:49,142
First brush your teeth;
your mouth is stinking!

186
00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:59,077
The first time I ogle at a girl...
and I get caught.

187
00:35:16,412 --> 00:35:18,279
You're fond of taking
pictures, aren't you?

188
00:35:18,812 --> 00:35:20,679
That's right.

189
00:35:21,212 --> 00:35:23,079
You must be fond of
stealing pictures too.

190
00:35:26,013 --> 00:35:29,946
If the picture were good,
it'll remain etched in my heart.

191
00:35:30,246 --> 00:35:32,680
Where is my photograph?
- Your photograph?

192
00:35:34,313 --> 00:35:38,281
Perhaps in my eyes.
- I talk of my uncle's snap.

193
00:35:38,547 --> 00:35:42,281
You uncle's snap
must be in your heart.

194
00:35:42,814 --> 00:35:44,381
You are insolent!

195
00:35:44,448 --> 00:35:47,881
Insolent is one who crosses
the limits of decency.

196
00:35:48,715 --> 00:35:53,149
Is your uncle's snap really missing?
- D'you think I'm lying.

197
00:35:53,449 --> 00:35:55,882
I'm sorry, but there's no
police station around.

198
00:35:56,016 --> 00:35:59,883
Otherwise I'd have accompanied you
to lodge a complaint.

199
00:36:00,016 --> 00:36:01,316
Thanks!
- Please listen.

200
00:36:01,616 --> 00:36:04,350
What is it?
- Thanks!

201
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:08,217
Had your uncle been here,
I'd click a new picture of him.

202
00:36:08,684 --> 00:36:11,084
Thanks!
- Thanking doesn't end the matter.

203
00:36:11,217 --> 00:36:13,184
I want to tell you something.
- What?

204
00:36:13,451 --> 00:36:16,618
That this place and our
companions are so strange.

205
00:36:16,818 --> 00:36:19,085
I can see that.
- Say what you want...

206
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:22,285
but remember, there is danger
lurking at every step.

207
00:36:22,818 --> 00:36:25,552
If there is anyone who can
protect you... it's your truly.

208
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:30,286
May I go?
- Sure, but don't venture out alone.

209
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:34,286
Our destinations may differ.
- It could be the same. Try it out.

210
00:36:35,886 --> 00:36:39,087
If you hurt your foot,
it will be difficult to walk.

211
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,187
Life with you in a few days
will be difficult anyway.

212
00:36:41,353 --> 00:36:43,087
It's my life that has
become difficult!

213
00:40:35,244 --> 00:40:37,510
Welcome, Dharamdas...
Fond of fishing, aren't you?

214
00:40:38,277 --> 00:40:40,411
And what interest
brings you here?

215
00:40:40,677 --> 00:40:42,811
I've been watching Miss Kitty
spend a long time in the water.

216
00:40:46,311 --> 00:40:50,012
She's calling you!
- Me? No. It's you she's calling.

217
00:40:56,046 --> 00:40:57,512
The water is very cold.

218
00:40:57,646 --> 00:40:59,113
Spend a little more time here
and you'll be an expert at swimming.

219
00:40:59,246 --> 00:41:04,380
We'll have to stay here, because
there's no way out of here.

220
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,313
Our tormentor has wisely
chosen this place.

221
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,414
Come here! Quick!

222
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,114
I've spotted a ship!

223
00:41:56,452 --> 00:41:59,119
The wielder of the knife and the
fisherman are both missing.

224
00:41:59,385 --> 00:42:02,019
And Ms Kitty has a stomach-ache.

225
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:05,219
Am I a machine to cook for
so many people?

226
00:42:06,053 --> 00:42:08,720
It's late.
They should've returned by now.

227
00:42:09,386 --> 00:42:12,420
There they are.
Now sit for dinner.

228
00:42:13,253 --> 00:42:17,187
I'm sorry to be late.
- Better late than never!

229
00:42:19,654 --> 00:42:22,321
Where is Kishan?
- Wasn't he with you?

230
00:42:22,454 --> 00:42:23,921
No, I went aone
and came alone.

231
00:42:24,054 --> 00:42:25,521
Didn't you even see him?
- No.

232
00:42:26,855 --> 00:42:29,988
Then where could he be?
We must look for him.

233
00:42:30,288 --> 00:42:34,022
He went of his own volition,
he'll return on his own.

234
00:42:34,189 --> 00:42:36,422
If he's careless,
we mustn't follow suit.

235
00:42:36,689 --> 00:42:38,323
I'll go and take a look.

236
00:42:41,256 --> 00:42:42,323
Better lay the food.

237
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:47,123
Can't you see all this food?
You ought to wear glasses!

238
00:42:47,257 --> 00:42:50,324
I've fried the fish you caught.

239
00:43:08,659 --> 00:43:11,126
You?
- Didn't you say...

240
00:43:11,259 --> 00:43:13,526
that danger lurks
at every step.

241
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:16,426
Let's go together.
- You want to accompany me?

242
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,427
In search of Kishan.
- Still better.

243
00:44:08,465 --> 00:44:10,332
Why did you laugh?
It was not me, Anand.

244
00:44:10,865 --> 00:44:12,732
That voice, then?

245
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:06,004
The butler was right.
There is a spirit here.

246
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,438
Come, let's go.

247
00:45:16,738 --> 00:45:20,172
He's not here either.
- I wonder where he has gone.

248
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,006
Let's look there.

249
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,547
I found this letter near
Kishan's body.

250
00:46:45,681 --> 00:46:47,947
I thought of reading it in
everyone's presence. It says...

251
00:46:48,748 --> 00:46:51,948
"do not mourn Kishan's death
because he was a murderer"

252
00:46:52,481 --> 00:46:54,348
"He ran over a man
with his car..."

253
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:56,448
"who was a victim of
your conspiracy"

254
00:46:56,915 --> 00:46:59,949
And his name was Mr. Sohanlal.

255
00:47:04,482 --> 00:47:08,750
Dharamdas, why are your hands
shaking? Did you know him?

256
00:47:09,283 --> 00:47:12,283
I know him.
He was my uncle.

257
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:17,550
It's so ironic that till this morning
Kishan was with us...

258
00:47:18,084 --> 00:47:20,717
and now...
- I can still visualise that scene.

259
00:47:21,284 --> 00:47:23,651
When he stood atop the
mountain to wave at the ship.

260
00:47:24,618 --> 00:47:27,151
Who knew death would
claim him so soon!

261
00:47:28,485 --> 00:47:31,952
As far as I think, none of us
saw him after this morning.

262
00:47:32,485 --> 00:47:34,052
And we found him dead at night.

263
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:35,486
It means he was murdered
in the evening.

264
00:47:35,952 --> 00:47:38,853
Dharamdas too returned late
for dinner.

265
00:47:39,286 --> 00:47:41,886
You misunderstand!
I've done nothing!

266
00:47:42,853 --> 00:47:48,420
Where did you find the dagger
with which Kishan was killed?

267
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:51,120
Dharamdas always keeps it
under his pillow.

268
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:54,354
Isn't it, Dharamdas?
- This is a lie.

269
00:47:54,687 --> 00:47:57,254
It means that dagger was yours?
You killed Kishan?

270
00:47:57,421 --> 00:47:59,655
You are a murderer.
- This is a lie.

271
00:47:59,721 --> 00:48:03,155
I'm innocent.
- Prove it.

272
00:48:03,655 --> 00:48:05,555
I think we'll give him time
till tomorrow evening.

273
00:48:05,789 --> 00:48:11,956
But why don't you believe me?
I have killed no one! It's a lie!

274
00:48:14,856 --> 00:48:17,256
It's a lie!

275
00:48:21,257 --> 00:48:22,857
One is gone.

276
00:48:43,926 --> 00:48:50,060
You toil so much...
- That is my job, mister.

277
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,361
Listen...
- What?

278
00:48:59,294 --> 00:49:01,561
Who realises his duties
nowadays?

279
00:49:01,694 --> 00:49:04,761
Do you realise your duty?

280
00:49:04,895 --> 00:49:08,762
Had you realised it,
you'd have tipped me.

281
00:49:10,495 --> 00:49:14,362
Here you are.
- How reluctantly you give!

282
00:49:15,296 --> 00:49:17,562
What will I have to do
for this tenner?

283
00:49:19,296 --> 00:49:21,263
By God!
You are a very smart chap.

284
00:49:22,063 --> 00:49:28,764
Why drag God into this?
Give Him rest for a while.

285
00:49:28,897 --> 00:49:31,631
Only God will save me here.
- Is that so?

286
00:49:33,264 --> 00:49:37,564
Tell me, who killed Kishan?
- How'd I know about who...

287
00:49:38,865 --> 00:49:40,465
How can I tell you that?

288
00:49:42,498 --> 00:49:47,165
But I sure know that
Lord Kishan had killed Kamsa.

289
00:49:47,965 --> 00:49:51,166
Not that Kishan; our Kishin.
- Allah!

290
00:49:51,299 --> 00:49:56,766
I don't know but everyone
was hinting at you.

291
00:49:57,266 --> 00:50:01,233
I did not kill anyone.

292
00:50:01,567 --> 00:50:05,267
Don't cry...
just prove it otherwise.

293
00:50:05,401 --> 00:50:09,568
Do you think the fish
will testify for me?

294
00:50:12,768 --> 00:50:16,768
What are you trying to do?
- You say...

295
00:50:18,068 --> 00:50:19,669
What?
- That we were together.

296
00:50:19,802 --> 00:50:21,269
Or else they will kill me.

297
00:50:21,436 --> 00:50:24,469
Don't shift the blame
on my shoulders.

298
00:50:24,803 --> 00:50:27,969
My life is more precious to
me than yours.

299
00:50:28,736 --> 00:50:31,170
In which case, I value
this tenner more than you.

300
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:36,770
He's going to die... surely die!
