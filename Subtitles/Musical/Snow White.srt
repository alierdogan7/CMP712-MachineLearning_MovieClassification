It's been a terrible season

1314
01:07:14,016 --> 01:07:15,495
on the farm this year.

1315
01:07:17,289 --> 01:07:18,520
But there's one

1316
01:07:18,521 --> 01:07:19,750
very special tree

1317
01:07:19,791 --> 01:07:20,939
that's grown the best

1318
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:22,086
apples I've ever seen.

1319
01:07:23,962 --> 01:07:24,963
They look so strange.

1320
01:07:26,215 --> 01:07:27,216
That's because

1321
01:07:27,217 --> 01:07:28,217
it's a special tree.

1322
01:07:29,051 --> 01:07:30,343
Why don't you buy this one?

1323
01:07:31,762 --> 01:07:33,181
No, I mustn't.

1324
01:07:33,182 --> 01:07:34,598
The dwarfs would be cross.

1325
01:07:34,639 --> 01:07:36,224
Oh, we wouldn't want

1326
01:07:36,225 --> 01:07:37,809
to make the dwarfs cross,

1327
01:07:34,639 --> 01:07:37,809
would we?

1328
01:07:39,103 --> 01:07:40,729
Here then,

1329
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:42,355
take it as a gift.

1330
01:07:42,397 --> 01:07:43,878
You're so kind.

1331
01:07:43,879 --> 01:07:45,358
It is such a

1332
01:07:42,397 --> 01:07:45,358
nice-looking apple...

1333
01:07:46,568 --> 01:07:48,361
But I shouldn't.

1334
01:07:48,403 --> 01:07:49,926
You're not afraid

1335
01:07:49,927 --> 01:07:51,448

1340
01:07:57,059 --> 01:07:58,872
the white half

1341
01:07:58,914 --> 01:08:00,521
and you take

1342
01:08:00,522 --> 01:08:02,126
the red half.

1343
01:08:02,167 --> 01:08:04,128
It's the most delicious

1344
01:08:04,129 --> 01:08:06,088
and sweetest.

1345
01:08:06,130 --> 01:08:08,757
No. I'd prefer the white.
