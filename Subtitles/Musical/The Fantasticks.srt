doing up there, dear?

Studying.

13
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:08,749
Well, that's good.

14
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,620
What's that for?

15
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:14,288
Number 26.

would you do
your dad a favor

20

27

ever that romantic.

How many times,
since they moved in,

56

Have I told you not to talk
to that idiot next door?

57

Couple of hundred.

A couple of
hundred times you told me
not to talk to his son either.

* Then go to town
In a golden gown

* And have my fortune told

* Or if the band
could stand it

that we wanted them wed.

all over the cat?

do something like that

we said was no?

00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,177
Come on.

182
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,245
Our fathers.

183
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:39,646
I don't care
about our fathers.

184
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,348
I don't care
about the wall.

185
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,151
I don't care about
anything but you.

186
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:47,620
* If we were in
Verona long ago

187
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:52,993
* And just like the story,
our true love forbidden

188
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:58,098
* I would study swordplay
and I'd stand
and fight them all

189
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:01,368
* Anyone who would come
between us

190
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:07,107
* Would have to deal with me

191
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,978
* I'd stand and face them all

192
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:13,346
* As one by one they'd fall

193
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:17,017
* You'd fight them all

194
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,252
* They'd start to fall

195
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:25,392
BOTH:
* Love conquers all!

196
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,027
* Love!
* I am love!

197
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,029
* You are love!
* I am love!

198
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:33,433
* Better far than a metaphor
can ever, ever be

199
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,068
* Love!
* I am love!

200
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:36,203
* You are love!

201
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:37,304
* I am love!

202
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:38,638
* My mystery...

203
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,141
* His mystery...

204
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:47,447
* Of love

205
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:53,153
* You are Polaris,
the one trustworthy star

206
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:55,188
* You are!
* I am!

207
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:56,689
* You are!
* I am!

208
00:15:56,723 --> 00:16:00,627
* You are September,
A special mystery

209
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,629
* To me!
* To he!

210
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,531
* To me!
* To he!

211
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:08,535
* You are sunlight! Moonlight!
Mountains! Valleys!

212
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:11,571
* The microscopic
inside of a leaf!

213
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:13,706
* My joy!

214
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,807
* Yes, I am his joy!

215
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:17,177
* My grief!
* Yes, I am his grief!

216
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,479
* My star!
* Yes, I am his star!

217
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:22,249
* My leaf!
* Yes, I am his leaf!

218
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:23,516
* Oh. Love!

219
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,517
* I am love!

220
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:26,653
* You are love!
* I am love!

221
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:31,558
* Better far than a metaphor
can ever, ever be

222
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,461
* Love!

223
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,429
* I am love!

224
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:38,298
* You are love!

225
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,734
* I am love!

226
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:44,571
* My mystery

227
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:48,775
* His mystery

228
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:54,347
* Of love

229
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:58,151
* Love

230
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:01,654
* Love

231
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:08,661
* Love

232
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,601
Do you speak English?

233
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,769
Oh, my God.
What is it?

234
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:19,072
It's my father.

235
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:20,140
Must be this one.

236
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:21,441
MATT: My father too.

237
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:22,742
They're not
supposed to be here.

238
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,244
Neither are we.

239
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:29,249
We'll meet tonight,
by the big tree.

240
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:30,417
In the moonlight.

241
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,551
In moonlight.

242
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:36,823
It's a century
till moonlight.

243
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:41,461
I'll never wash
this hand again.

244
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:49,302
What the devil...

245
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:50,337
At your service.

246
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:56,243
Wait, you the famous
El Gallo?

247
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:57,344
El Gallo.

248
00:17:57,377 --> 00:18:00,847
Oh, yeah. See, we got your
advertisement in the mail

249
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,583
And we got ourselves
a little problem.

250
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:05,385
A love problem.

251
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,554
You two have a love problem?

252
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,790
And you seek sympathy
from our little
band of outcasts.

253
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,859
What would you two be willing
to do in front of an audience?

254
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,163
No, wait a minute...

255
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:17,464
We are not
talking about us.

256
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:19,366
We're talking
about our kids.

257
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,100
Who happen to be
a boy and a girl.

258
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,470
Less challenging.
Follow me.

259
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:27,907
Although we are not
yet fully prepared

260
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,343
The official opening
of the entire carnival,

261
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:32,312
I think we can proceed
with our business here.

262
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:35,348
One moment,
I'll check my files.

263
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:37,284
I'm sorry,
what did you say
your names were?

264
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:39,252
Hucklebee.
Bellomy.

265
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:42,455
I do beg your pardon,
this is "N" through "Z."

266
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:44,191
Yes, there we are,
"A" through "M."
Oh!

267
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:45,292
How did you do that?

268
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:47,194
It wasn't easy
it took months to
set up these files.

269
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:48,261
Oh my...

270
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:50,330
(WHISPERING) Quiet.
I'm beginning to
get a picture.

271
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:53,866
You said you had
a daughter?

272
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,403
Yes.
I see a girl.

273
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:57,604
Is her name Luisa?

274
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,805
Is that your
daughter's name.

275
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:01,408
Yes.
That's her. Oh, look.

276
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:05,412
She is standing
next to a young man
who must be, who must be...

277
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,414
Quick, before
the image fades.

278
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:09,416
Matt.
That's it.

279
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,351
You're amazing.

280
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,353
They seem to be
happy enough.

281
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:14,421
What about the feud?

282
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:16,423
Of course that's there,
I said "seem."

283
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:18,691
Obviously your children
are feeling
a great deal of torment.

284
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:19,726
Uncanny.

285
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,262
And you've come to me
for some kind of magic, eh?

286
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:24,163
You're in luck.

287
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,535
Ooh!

288
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:32,305
Frankly, we came to you
to find out
how to end this feud.

289
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,641
Many paths lead
to the summit.
Follow me.

290
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,846
You know,
we kind of thought
it'd be a good idea

291
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:43,650
If my mild-mannered son
was turned into
a rip-roaring hero.

292
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,252
Really?
Well, yes, that would be

293
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:46,719
The first thought of
a common rural mind.

294
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:48,788
And by an amazing coincidence,
it's also mine.

295
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,623
Ah! Boy, are we lucky.

296
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:54,894
Of course to have a hero,
you must first have a villain.

297
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:58,265
That makes sense. But who?

298
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:02,469
Let's think, the young lady
knows both of you,
so that wouldn't work.

299
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:06,673
What about you?
Me?

300
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:10,443
Oh, I couldn't
do it, for free.

301
00:20:10,477 --> 00:20:12,712
But for a small donation
to my favorite charity...

302
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:14,814
Yeah.

303
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,587
Yeah.

304
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,823
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

305
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:26,559
Would $60 be
an insult?

306
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,928
Yes, but I'm used to abuse.

307
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:31,998
Oh, yes. I see it,
I start to
kidnap his daughter,

308
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:34,301
Your son runs in to save her.
Then a battle.

309
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:36,436
I allow the boy to defeat me,
your son becomes a hero,

310
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:39,005
The parents relent,
the feud is over forever.

311
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,774
She melts into his arms.

312
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,445
How much for such a drama?

313
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:47,447
That, senor, depends.

314
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,449
Depends on what?
On what else.

315
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:50,917
The quality of the rape.

316
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,989
Rape? No!
No rape!

317
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:58,791
Oh, very well then,
the abduction.

318
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:01,394
The rape, the chase,
the kidnapping.

319
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:04,564
Call it what you will,
from the Latin rapere.

320
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:05,865
Meaning "to seize."

321
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:12,405
* Abductions, abductions,
Theatrical abductions

322
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:16,376
* Complete with
maidens in distress
And fabulous productions

323
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:21,514
* The sort of thing you see
Upon the operatic stage

324
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:24,917
* Two lovers are meeting
Their happiness is fleeting

325
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:28,888
* All at once a bandit man
Is standing there repeating!

326
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:30,623
* Surrender and so forth

327
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:32,592
* Give us the girl!
And so forth

328
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,862
* In short they are surrounded
by a gang of angry men

329
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:39,932
* I see it, I see it
A gang of angry men

330
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:45,638
* Heaven
I can assure you
this is heaven

331
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:49,576
* For six,
young love is out of seven

332
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,411
* This is a dream of ecstasy

333
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:54,614
* How can we deny them
such a dream of ecstasy?

334
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,850
* Sounds a bit expensive
I would like to know the fee

335
00:21:57,884 --> 00:22:01,621
* The people are cheering,
I'm standing center leering

336
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:05,458
* I wear a cape
and steer a snare
That's really quite endearing

337
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:08,995
* I enter and so forth
I grab the girl and so forth

338
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:12,665
* I ravish her and start to
carry her into the night

339
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:16,436
* The hero, he sees her,
he grabs the girl
and frees her

340
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:18,371
* He tries to tweak me
by the nose

341
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:19,839
* Which certainly
should please her

342
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:23,810
* We argue and so forth
We draw our
swords and so forth

343
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:27,547
* We shout "En garde!"
And fight until
I stagger and I die

344
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,983
* They're fighting, exciting,
El Gallo starts to die

345
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:34,654
* The parents relenting,
resolve the scene presenting

346
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:38,391
* A prefect picture of content
With both of them consenting

347
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:41,961
* To marriage and so forth
To end the feud and so forth

348
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:45,665
* They swear to
tear the world apart
And live in harmony

349
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:49,168
* The lovers are kissing
The parents reminiscing

350
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,070
* The scene is
one of utter bliss

351
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,005
* With not a cliche missing

352
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,841
* There's laughter
and so forth

353
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,409
* A happy dance and so forth

354
00:22:56,443 --> 00:23:00,447
* Then all at once
A harpist and
a piano start to play

355
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,148
* I hear it
* He hears it

356
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:04,150
* How beautifully they play

357
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:05,552
* Drama

358
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:06,686
* A stormy night

359
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,721
* What he's offering is drama

360
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:09,956
* A bloody fight

361
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:12,725
* In my life's faded cyclorama

362
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:13,760
* What a sight

363
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:15,027
* He tries to shed
a little light

364
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:18,731
* It's so exciting when
you shed a little light

365
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:19,932
* Really

366
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:21,033
* The lovers kiss

367
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,770
* I must admit
that this is thrilling

368
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:24,871
* Oh, such happiness

369
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,106
* And it can happen
if I'm willing

370
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,107
* How can it miss?

371
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,609
* Just make sure
the price is right

372
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:33,613
* So why be pikers?
Just make sure
the price is right

373
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:34,914
* Why should we be pikers?

374
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:36,883
* Just make sure
the price is right

375
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:40,620
* Abductions, abductions
Theatrical abductions

376
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:44,156
* Complete with
maidens in distress
And fabulous productions

377
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,660
* With moonlight, and so forth
A happy end and so forth

378
00:23:47,694 --> 00:23:53,500
* And it all depends on one

379
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:55,502
* It all depends

380
00:23:55,535 --> 00:23:56,903
* It all...

381
00:23:56,936 --> 00:24:00,907
* Depends on what you pay

382
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,775
* Pay!

383
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:05,177
* Pay!

384
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:06,679
* Olay!

385
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:12,051
First class it is.
Now, let's see.

386
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:14,086
What else should we use?

387
00:24:15,655 --> 00:24:18,090
Do you want Jo-Jo
the Chicken Lady?

388
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:20,727
I don't think so.

389
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,529
I know, the Bavarian baby.

390
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:25,131
I've got one who
is very talented,
he can swallow a sword.

391
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:27,634
If you throw in $4 extra
he cleans up after himself.

392
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:28,835
What about that act?

393
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:30,002
Which?

394
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:33,272
"Shakespearian company,
direct from London."

395
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,275
"Theatre Royal, Drury Lane."

396
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,144
No. No, you don't want that.

397
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:39,579
Now, instead...

398
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:41,013
I think Shakespeare
is a great idea.

399
00:24:41,047 --> 00:24:43,015
After all, my son
thinks he is Romeo.

400
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:44,817
My daughter would be
a perfect Juliet.

401
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:48,955
Really, gentlemen,
I assure you
it's not a good idea.

402
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,190
Now, for a first
class abduction...

403
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52,659
Let me see.

404
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:54,927
BELLOMY: But Shakespeare,
that's real class.

405
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:56,629
I was in a Shakespeare
play once.

406
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:58,731
HUCKLEBEE: Really?
Uh-huh.

407
00:24:58,765 --> 00:25:00,166
My daughter would
like Shakespeare.

408
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:04,837
So would my son.
Likes that
I am the Pantomim whatever.

409
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:08,507
And with Shakespeare,
it's sure to be
done in good taste.

410
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:16,783
Sir, the players have arrived.

411
00:25:16,816 --> 00:25:19,719
Thank you.
But your services
will not be necessary.

412
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:22,021
Now or ever.
Back in the trunk.

413
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:24,256
These men are from London?

414
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,693
Straight from
Theatre Royal, Drury Lane?

415
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:28,895
Absolutely, one long,
straight ride.

416
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:30,597
Down.

417
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,900
Don't see us as we are.
Gentlemen, please.

418
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:38,137
Remove ten pounds of
road dust from these
aged wrinkled cheeks.

419
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:41,173
See make-up caked in
glowing powder pink.

420
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:45,277
Imagine a beard, full-blown
and glowing like
the whiskers of a bear.

421
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:48,881
Imagine hair in a box,
I have all colors.

422
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:51,784
Please, I beg of you,
imagine hair.

423
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:01,093
And not these clothes,
dear God, no, no.

424
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:04,764
Not rags like
every beggar has.

425
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:06,899
But see me in a doublet.

426
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:09,035
Mortimer, fetch the doublet.

427
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:13,039
Thank you.

428
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:17,910
EL GALLO: Gentlemen,
if you insist
on Shakespeare,

429
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:19,679
My advice is,
don't over-rehearse.

430
00:26:19,712 --> 00:26:22,949
Say a cue, you'll see,
I'll know it. Go on, try me.

431
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:25,918
Friends, Romans,
countrymen.

432
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:27,019
Is what?

433
00:26:28,354 --> 00:26:30,056
Friends, Romans, countrymen.

434
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,257
No, no, no.

435
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:34,293
Don't tell me,
I'll get it.
You'll see.

436
00:26:36,963 --> 00:26:40,332
Oh, yes, of course, of course.
Why, that's easy.

437
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:42,201
Why didn't you pick
a hard one?

438
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:44,170
Now, here, watch this.

439
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:51,077
Friends, Romans, countrymen.

440
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:55,882
Screw your courage

441
00:26:55,915 --> 00:26:57,884
To that sticking place.

442
00:26:57,917 --> 00:27:00,386
And be not sick.

443
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,056
And pale with reef.

444
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:07,426
For thou are handmaidens.

445
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:10,863
But far more fair than she.

446
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:13,199
Is.

447
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:18,705
How was that?

448
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:20,539
Do you think
he can do it?

449
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,875
The chicken lady is cheaper
and you get to keep the eggs.

450
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:25,845
I got faith in the bard,
let's sign him on.

451
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:27,914
Thank you. Thank you.

452
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:33,119
Thank you.

453
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:36,255
Allow me to
introduce myself.

454
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:38,858
I am Henry Albertson.

455
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:40,059
BELLOMY: And who is that?

456
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:41,861
HENRY: That's Mortimer.

457
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:44,396
He has been with me
all his life.
He does death scenes.

458
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,833
Would you like to see one?
He's an expert.

459
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:49,168
Mortimer,
die for the gentlemen.

460
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:54,340
(CHOKING)

461
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:04,683
(GROANS)

462
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:15,361
And that's the short version.

463
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:17,997
The Indian is
out of the question.

464
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,431
Besides,
I think he is dead.

465
00:28:19,465 --> 00:28:22,301
Oh. Too bad, 'cause
they're a team.
Inseparable.

466
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:23,369
So what could we
use instead?

467
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:26,238
How about Siamese twins.
Two for the price of one.

468
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:28,440
Nah, we're gonna
stick with Shakespeare.

469
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:31,778
Yeah. It'll be
a lifelong memory
for the children.

470
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:34,313
Lifelong memory it is.

471
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:36,215
Still not sure about
the Indian.

472
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:39,886
Gentlemen, we must hurry.
We have an abduction to stage.

473
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,088
This very night.

474
00:28:48,094 --> 00:28:51,931
Here, you two had
better go home
and rehearse your parts.

475
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:54,200
Parts? We're not actors.

476
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,402
This is too much
to memorize.

477
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:02,809
Not actors, you say.
Very well then.

478
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:05,744
We'll do the abridged version.

479
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:13,085
* Abductions, abductions
Theatrical abductions

480
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:15,822
* Complete with
maidens in distress
And fabulous...

481
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:16,889
That's my part.

482
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:18,524
* With moonlight and so forth

483
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:20,359
* And happy
ending and so forth

484
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:24,430
* And it all depends on

485
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:27,834
* What you

486
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:29,001
* Pay

487
00:29:29,035 --> 00:29:30,169
That's my part.

488
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:35,141
Hello.

489
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:37,009
Hello.

490
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,519
I should have put on
something warmer.

491
00:29:47,553 --> 00:29:51,090
I didn't expect it
to be so cold.

492
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,525
Feel my hand,
it's trembling.

493
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:57,563
Oh. Oh, well, here.
I don't need this.

494
00:29:57,596 --> 00:29:58,865
No, you'll freeze.

495
00:29:58,898 --> 00:30:00,066
No, no, really. Please.

496
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:01,467
I'm fine.
I'm not cold at all.

497
00:30:06,906 --> 00:30:09,441
You're gonna wear it?

498
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:12,444
Yeah. You just said
you weren't cold, right?

499
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,447
Oh, I'm...

500
00:30:19,952 --> 00:30:21,153
(THUNDERCLAP)

501
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:26,725
It's all right.

502
00:30:30,596 --> 00:30:32,298
I'm scared, Matt.

503
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:36,102
I'll take care
of you, Luisa.

504
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:38,237
I promise,
I'll protect you.

505
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:42,341
I love you, Matt.

506
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:45,511
I want there to be
a happy ending.

507
00:30:47,113 --> 00:30:49,081
I promise that there will be.

508
00:30:50,082 --> 00:30:51,217
(THUNDERCLAP)

509
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:56,355
Feel that?
What?

510
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,025
My hand.

511
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:01,627
It's trembling too.

512
00:31:05,264 --> 00:31:09,601
* Hear how the wind
begins to whisper

513
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:14,240
* See how the leaves go
streaming by

514
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:19,045
* Smell how the velvet rain
is falling,

515
00:31:19,078 --> 00:31:23,549
* Out where the fields are
warm and dry

516
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:30,056
* Now is the time
to run inside and stay

517
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:38,998
* Now is the time
to find a hideaway

518
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:46,638
* Where we can stay

519
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:57,516
MATT:
* Soon it's gonna rain
I can see it

520
00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:02,154
* Soon it's gonna rain
I can tell

521
00:32:02,188 --> 00:32:08,427
* Soon it's gonna rain
What are we gonna do?

522
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:15,001
* We'll find
four limbs of a tree

523
00:32:15,034 --> 00:32:19,571
* We'll build
four walls and a floor

524
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:24,243
* We'll bind it
over with leaves

525
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:28,447
* And duck inside to stay

526
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:32,351
* Then we'll let it rain

527
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:34,653
* We'll not feel it

528
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:36,722
* Then we'll let it rain

529
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:39,191

712
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:26,064
We never would've let
you stay out all night!

713
00:49:26,097 --> 00:49:29,167
Your father and I,
we treat you like adults.

714
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,170
And you turn around
and you act like
a couple of spoilt kids.

715
00:49:32,203 --> 00:49:34,572
Now, I want you two
to kiss and make up.

716
00:49:34,605 --> 00:49:36,341
This should be
a beautiful moment.

717
00:49:36,374 --> 00:49:37,642
An act of heroism
took place last night.

718
00:49:37,675 --> 00:49:39,110
Come on.

719
00:49:39,144 --> 00:49:40,245
No expense was spared.

720
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:46,151
Bellomy.

721
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:56,027
Nice going, Bellomy.

722
00:49:56,061 --> 00:50:00,131
Two hundred and fifty
smackers down the drain.

723
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:03,768
This is just great.

724
00:50:03,801 --> 00:50:05,270
MATT: Wait a minute.

725
00:50:05,303 --> 00:50:07,105
You two paid for us?

726
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,442
All my heroics
were make believe?

727
00:50:19,484 --> 00:50:21,486
What would you call
a man who would stoop

728
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:23,521
As low as to do
something like this?

729
00:50:24,255 --> 00:50:25,490
A father.

730
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,530
Matt, where are you going?

731
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:34,132
I got a score to settle.

732
00:50:34,165 --> 00:50:36,101
Wait, I'm coming with you.

733
00:50:36,134 --> 00:50:37,202
Luisa.

734
00:50:37,802 --> 00:50:38,803
Luisa.

735
00:50:41,272 --> 00:50:43,574
Matt, wait,
I'm coming with you.

736
00:50:54,819 --> 00:50:56,554
No refunds.
Even with a receipt.

737
00:51:00,225 --> 00:51:02,193
Somebody
get me a sword.

738
00:51:16,707 --> 00:51:17,708
(GROANS)

739
00:51:23,181 --> 00:51:24,415
En garde!

740
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:35,726
Up a bit with the wrists.

741
00:51:37,328 --> 00:51:38,696
A foot back more.

742
00:51:38,729 --> 00:51:41,166
Never take your eyes
from your opponent!

743
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,535
Quickly!

744
00:51:44,569 --> 00:51:46,704
Aim for the entrails.

745
00:51:46,737 --> 00:51:48,139
Good. Encore.

746
00:51:52,477 --> 00:51:53,844
You have great enthusiasm,

747
00:51:53,878 --> 00:51:56,447
But as in all things,
experience counts
for everything.

748
00:52:08,393 --> 00:52:09,394
(GRUNTING)

749
00:52:10,828 --> 00:52:12,463
It's impolite
to attack a man

750
00:52:12,497 --> 00:52:13,831
Once he's in his
space of shaving.

751
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,702
Oh, I forgot.
You don't shave.

752
00:52:20,938 --> 00:52:22,139
(GRUNTING)

753
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:27,478
I'm available for lessons.

754
00:52:49,934 --> 00:52:51,836
Matt!

755
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:54,939
This isn't much fun
when you're not being paid.

756
00:52:57,608 --> 00:52:58,809
Matt?

757
00:53:08,886 --> 00:53:10,588
You... You...

758
00:53:10,621 --> 00:53:11,656
Villain.

759
00:53:13,824 --> 00:53:14,825
Don't do that.

760
00:53:16,894 --> 00:53:18,796
You'll hurt your hand.

761
00:53:29,974 --> 00:53:31,409
Nice boy.

762
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,947
Wait.

763
00:53:36,981 --> 00:53:38,249
What?

764
00:53:38,283 --> 00:53:40,485
What did you say?

765
00:53:40,518 --> 00:53:42,387
I didn't say anything.

766
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,489
Then what
were you thinking?

767
00:53:44,522 --> 00:53:46,624
I wasn't
thinking anything.

768
00:53:46,657 --> 00:53:50,428
Yes you were. Well,
what are you thinking now?

769
00:53:50,461 --> 00:53:53,298
Well...
Go on say it.

770
00:53:53,331 --> 00:53:55,700
I just wanted to tell you,
I think you were right.

771
00:53:56,867 --> 00:53:58,703
Right?

772
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:00,771
Not to pick up
the sword again.

773
00:54:00,805 --> 00:54:01,972
Not to fight with him.

774
00:54:03,808 --> 00:54:05,543
What I mean is...

775
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:07,478
Maybe you're not ready yet.

776
00:54:08,479 --> 00:54:09,847
To be a hero.

777
00:54:10,481 --> 00:54:11,516
No?

778
00:54:12,683 --> 00:54:14,352
Well, maybe
I can be the villain.

779
00:54:14,385 --> 00:54:16,687
He seems to have
all the good scenes.

780
00:54:16,721 --> 00:54:18,389
With you anyway.

781
00:54:19,324 --> 00:54:20,825
"You'll hurt your hand."

782
00:54:20,858 --> 00:54:23,894
(SCOFFS) What a line.

783
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:28,333
I don't need you.

784
00:54:28,366 --> 00:54:29,700
I don't need any of this.

785
00:54:29,734 --> 00:54:31,736
I'm gonna go out
into the big world

786
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:34,939
And make a pile of money
and surround myself
with beautiful women

787
00:54:34,972 --> 00:54:36,707
Who appreciate me.

788
00:54:37,908 --> 00:54:39,510
See if I care.

789
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,458
(SOBBING)

790
00:55:38,536 --> 00:55:44,642
* Beyond that road
lies a shining world

791
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:50,581
* Beyond that
road lies despair

792
00:55:50,615 --> 00:55:56,821
* Beyond that road
Lies a world that's gleaming

793
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:59,390
* People who are scheming

794
00:55:59,824 --> 00:56:01,125
* Beauty!

795
00:56:01,158 --> 00:56:02,693
EL GALLO:
* Hunger!

796
00:56:02,727 --> 00:56:03,961
* Glory!

797
00:56:03,994 --> 00:56:05,796
* Sorrow!

798
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:10,000
* Never a pain or care

799
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:18,576
* He's liable to find

800
00:56:18,609 --> 00:56:24,615
* A couple of surprises there

801
00:56:26,484 --> 00:56:31,622
* For, I can see it!

802
00:56:32,957 --> 00:56:36,927
* Shining somewhere!

803
00:56:38,763 --> 00:56:43,167
* Bright lights somewhere
Invite me to come there

804
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:48,939
* And learn!
And I'm ready!

805
00:56:48,973 --> 00:56:52,810
* I can hear it!

806
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:58,649
* Sirens singing!

807
00:57:00,017 --> 00:57:03,988
* Inside my ear
I hear them all singing

808
00:57:04,722 --> 00:57:10,728
* Come learn!

809
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:15,733
* Who knows, maybe
All the visions I can see

810
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:19,036
* May be waiting
just for me to say

811
00:57:19,069 --> 00:57:20,505
* I can see it!

812
00:57:20,538 --> 00:57:21,739
* Say

813
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:23,908
* Shining somewhere!
* Say!

814
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:26,511
* Take me there and
make me a part of it!

815
00:57:26,544 --> 00:57:27,945
* Make

816
00:57:27,978 --> 00:57:31,782
* Make me see
those shining
sights inside of me!

817
00:57:31,816 --> 00:57:34,519
* Make him feel it!

818
00:57:34,552 --> 00:57:37,187
* Make me feel
those lights inside

I know that it really may be!

I always waited for!

my life's created for!

* Let me learn!

823
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:04,081
Hello, big boy.

824
00:58:05,282 --> 00:58:07,484
Welcome to the Casbah.

825
00:58:14,725 --> 00:58:17,595
Getting kinda dizzy.
That perfume!

826
00:58:17,628 --> 00:58:19,564
It's Alexia de L'Amour.

827
00:58:20,264 --> 00:58:21,866
Drink that.

828
00:58:37,281 --> 00:58:38,716
What is it?

829
00:58:38,749 --> 00:58:40,685
A little something
from the Caliph.

830
00:58:40,718 --> 00:58:44,889
Two parts rhino horn,
one part mandrake,
one part ginseng.

831
00:58:44,922 --> 00:58:48,258
Absinthe and a little
sprinkling of cojonas.

832
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:50,227
What's that?

833
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,261
Don't ask.

834
00:59:24,762 --> 00:59:29,900
* I'd like to swim
in a clear blue stream

835
00:59:29,934 --> 00:59:34,905
* Where the water is icy cold

836
00:59:34,939 --> 00:59:40,645
* Then go to town
In a golden gown

837
00:59:40,678 --> 00:59:45,683
* And have my fortune told

838
00:59:45,716 --> 00:59:48,953
Just once.
Just once before you're old.

839
00:59:48,986 --> 00:59:50,187
It's my bandit.

840
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,388
Your bandit, yes.

841
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,223
What are you doing
up there in that tree?

842
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:54,659
Growing ripe.

843
00:59:54,692 --> 00:59:55,993
Don't grow too
ripe or you'll fall.

844
00:59:56,026 --> 00:59:57,127
Very wise.

845
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:01,331
What do you see from up there?

846
01:00:01,365 --> 01:00:02,667
Everything.

847
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:03,801
Do you see Matt?

848
01:00:03,834 --> 01:00:04,869
Do you care?

849
01:00:04,902 --> 01:00:06,036
No, I just wondered.

850
01:00:08,305 --> 01:00:10,174
Can I climb up
there beside you?

851
01:00:10,207 --> 01:00:11,709
You can if you can.

852
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:16,914
You know,
there's always my way.

853
01:00:18,816 --> 01:00:20,317
Put a ladder in the back.

854
01:00:48,212 --> 01:00:49,780
Is it fun to be a bandit?

855
01:00:49,814 --> 01:00:51,816
It has its moments, yes.

856
01:00:51,849 --> 01:00:53,751
I think it must be fun.

857
01:00:54,451 --> 01:00:55,753
So...

858
01:00:57,187 --> 01:00:59,289
How do you do it?

859
01:00:59,323 --> 01:01:01,992
Do you ride into town
pretending to be a carnival

860
01:01:02,026 --> 01:01:04,261
And then steal things
when people aren't looking?

861
01:01:04,294 --> 01:01:05,930
That's one way to go.

862
01:01:05,963 --> 01:01:07,297
And what do you steal?

863
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:10,200
Whatever's most valuable.
Whatever's treasured most.

864
01:01:11,268 --> 01:01:13,070
That's more like it.

865
01:01:17,908 --> 01:01:19,744
You see this ribbon?

866
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:24,181
That's where you
gave me a bruise.

867
01:01:36,927 --> 01:01:38,462
Take me with you.

868
01:01:42,232 --> 01:01:44,034
Show me your world.

869
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:50,941
What is it that you want?

870
01:01:53,343 --> 01:01:54,945
That's just it.

871
01:01:55,946 --> 01:01:57,948
I don't know what I want.

872
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:02,152
I want things
I've only heard about

873
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,721
Or dreamed.

874
01:02:06,824 --> 01:02:09,860
I want to see places
I've never seen before.

875
01:02:09,894 --> 01:02:12,729
I want to do things
I've never ever done.

876
01:02:13,831 --> 01:02:15,432
You and I.

877
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:17,835
Us. Together.

878
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:19,837
Yes.

879
01:02:20,938 --> 01:02:23,107
Dancing forever and forever.

* I'm ready anytime

885
01:02:40,825 --> 01:02:44,862
* If you'll take me,
I'm ready to go!

886
01:02:44,895 --> 01:02:47,932
* So show the way to me

887
01:02:47,965 --> 01:02:50,100
* I will try to be

888
01:02:50,134 --> 01:02:51,869
* Ready to go

889
01:03:06,951 --> 01:03:10,554

892
01:03:17,394 --> 01:03:20,064
* I could swoon!

893

* You're so blue
in the moon! *

894
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:26,136
Oh, look.
Carnival in Venice.

895
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:28,372
Something I've
always wanted to see.

896
01:03:28,405 --> 01:03:30,941
What's this?
A mask.

897
01:03:30,975 --> 01:03:32,076
But it doesn't
have any expression.

898
01:03:32,109 --> 01:03:33,443
Exactly.

899
01:03:33,477 --> 01:03:36,313
As long as you wear this mask
your feelings will
never betray you.

900
01:03:36,346 --> 01:03:39,149
No matter what happens,
with the mask,
you'll be able to laugh

901
01:03:39,183 --> 01:03:41,285
And dance through it all.

902
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:42,419
That boy looks familiar.

903
01:03:42,452 --> 01:03:43,420
Of course.

904
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:46,023
He's a country bumpkin,
they all look the same.

905
01:03:46,056 --> 01:03:48,258
And they all wind up
the same way.

906
01:03:48,292 --> 01:03:49,559
They're stealing his wallet.

907
01:03:49,593 --> 01:03:52,296
Put on the mask,
then it's amusing.

908
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:55,265
Oh, yes, I see,
they're just having fun.

909
01:03:56,133 --> 01:03:57,935
Bene! Bene!

it's terribly chic

* Atop the Acropolis,
it's terribly Greek

926
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:53,457
* There's Venus,
Adonis, and us
Cheek to cheek

927
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:55,692
* Oh, how chic!

928
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,062
* To be Greek

Oh, look.

931
01:05:05,202 --> 01:05:07,337
A Greek temple.

932
01:05:07,371 --> 01:05:10,207
And they're having
some sort of contest.

933
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,976
Maybe it's the Olympics!

934
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,945
Yes! It's Greek wrestling.

935
01:05:14,979 --> 01:05:16,480
Yes.

936
01:05:16,513 --> 01:05:19,249
That boy...
They're gonna kill him.

937
01:05:19,283 --> 01:05:21,485
Now remember,
if it is unpleasant.

938
01:05:21,518 --> 01:05:24,021
Yes, of course, the mask.

939
01:05:25,122 --> 01:05:28,525

Couldn't we just
sit this one out?

952
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:10,000
Ridiculous.
When there's music
to be danced to?

953
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,236

or maybe Bombay

See, he's there
with his assistants.

all loads of fun.

They're putting him
down on some nails.

1070
01:15:02,599 --> 01:15:03,833
El Gallo!

1071
01:15:12,108 --> 01:15:13,176
(SOBBING)

1072
01:15:20,249 --> 01:15:24,654
EL GALLO:
There is a curious paradox
that no one can explain.

1073
01:15:24,688 --> 01:15:28,758
Who understands the secret
of the reaping of the grain.

1074
01:15:28,792 --> 01:15:33,196
Who understands
why spring is born
out of winter's laboring pain.

1075
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:36,633
Or why we all must die a bit
before we grow again.

1076
01:15:41,971 --> 01:15:43,106
Matt.

1077
01:15:47,176 --> 01:15:48,778
What happened?

1078
01:15:49,913 --> 01:15:51,915
You look awful.

1079
01:15:51,948 --> 01:15:54,784
It isn't worth tears,
Luisa, please.

1080
01:15:58,855 --> 01:16:01,925
Did you find the money
and the beautiful women.

1081
01:16:02,726 --> 01:16:04,761
I can't remember, I...

1082
01:16:04,794 --> 01:16:07,664
I was drugged
or hypnotized
or something.

1083
01:16:09,799 --> 01:16:12,802
There was this
funny light and mirrors.

1084
01:16:13,369 --> 01:16:14,771
I know.

1085
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:17,306
And there was this music.

1086
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:19,909
Strange music and people

1087
01:16:19,943 --> 01:16:21,778
Turning and spinning and...

1088
01:16:21,811 --> 01:16:23,112
Wearing masks.

1089
01:16:24,047 --> 01:16:25,782
I remember crying out.

1090
01:16:25,815 --> 01:16:27,350
But no one came
to help you.

1091
01:16:34,023 --> 01:16:35,158
I'm sorry, Matt.

1092
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:38,795
No, I...

1093
01:16:38,828 --> 01:16:40,263
It's all right.

1094
01:16:42,131 --> 01:16:44,067
I deserved it.

1095
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,835
I've been foolish.

1096
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:48,237
I have, too.

1097
01:16:49,305 --> 01:16:51,374
Believe me,
more than you.

1098
01:16:56,746 --> 01:17:00,149
* When the moon was young

1099
01:17:00,183 --> 01:17:04,020
* When the month was May

1100
01:17:04,053 --> 01:17:10,259
* When the stage was hung
for my holiday

1101
01:17:11,094 --> 01:17:14,698
* I saw shining lights

1102
01:17:14,731 --> 01:17:18,201
* But I never knew

1103
01:17:18,234 --> 01:17:21,137
* They were you
They were you

1104
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:23,940
* They were you

1105
01:17:25,809 --> 01:17:29,245
* When the dance was done

1106
01:17:29,278 --> 01:17:32,882
* When I went my way

1107
01:17:32,916 --> 01:17:39,956
* When I tried to find
rainbows far away

1108
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:43,392
* All the lovely lights

1109
01:17:43,426 --> 01:17:47,096
* Seemed to fade from view

1110
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:50,734
* They were you
They were you

1111
01:17:50,767 --> 01:17:54,403
* They were you

1112
01:17:54,437 --> 01:18:01,210
BOTH:
* Without you near me

1113
01:18:01,911 --> 01:18:07,416
* I can't see

1114
01:18:08,351 --> 01:18:15,191
* When you're near me

1115
01:18:15,224 --> 01:18:20,296
* Wonderful things come to be

1116
01:18:22,098 --> 01:18:25,935
* Every secret prayer

1117
01:18:25,969 --> 01:18:29,472
* Every fancy free

1118
01:18:29,505 --> 01:18:36,780
* Everything I dared
for both you and me

1119
01:18:36,813 --> 01:18:40,283
* All my wildest dreams

1120
01:18:40,316 --> 01:18:44,287
* Multiplied by two

1121
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,189
* They were you

1122
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:48,057
* They were you

1123
01:18:48,091 --> 01:18:51,260
* They were you

1124
01:18:53,362 --> 01:18:57,200
* They were you

1125
01:18:57,233 --> 01:18:59,368
* They were you

1126
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:06,776
* They were you

1127
01:19:28,531 --> 01:19:30,299
I missed you, Matt.

1128
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,336
I missed you, too.

1129
01:19:33,369 --> 01:19:35,104
Here, maybe I can
stop your bleeding.

1130
01:19:35,138 --> 01:19:36,505
You already have.

1131
01:19:43,379 --> 01:19:45,248
You've been hurt too.

1132
01:19:48,551 --> 01:19:51,154
Look, it's beginning to snow.

1133
01:19:52,221 --> 01:19:53,990
I know.
Here.

1134
01:19:54,991 --> 01:19:56,359
Take my coat.

1135
01:19:57,426 --> 01:19:59,395
Both.

1136
01:19:59,428 --> 01:20:01,564
There's room there
for both.

1137
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:15,144
* Love! You are love!

1138
01:20:15,178 --> 01:20:16,880
* You are love!

1139
01:20:16,913 --> 01:20:23,252
* Better far than a metaphor
can ever, ever be

1140
01:20:24,387 --> 01:20:26,990
* Love!
* You are love!

1141
01:20:27,023 --> 01:20:28,457
* You are love!

1142
01:20:28,491 --> 01:20:31,060
* You are love!

1143
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:34,964
* My mystery

1144
01:20:34,998 --> 01:20:38,167
* My mystery

1145
01:20:40,269 --> 01:20:42,939
* Of Love!

1146
01:20:42,972 --> 01:20:44,373
BELLOMY:
Look, they've come back.

1147
01:20:44,407 --> 01:20:46,042
HUCKLEBEE:
It's a miracle.

1148
01:20:46,075 --> 01:20:47,476
They're home.

1149
01:20:49,245 --> 01:20:50,346
Matt!

1150
01:20:52,481 --> 01:20:53,883
Luisa.

1151
01:20:55,919 --> 01:21:02,091
EL GALLO:
* Try to remember
the kind of September

1152
01:21:02,125 --> 01:21:08,597
* When life was slow
and oh, so mellow

1153
01:21:08,631 --> 01:21:15,071
* Try to remember
the kind of September

1154
01:21:15,104 --> 01:21:21,610
* When grass was green
and grain was yellow

1155
01:21:21,644 --> 01:21:27,984
* Try to remember
the kind of September

1156
01:21:28,017 --> 01:21:34,623
* When you were
a tender and callow fellow

1157
01:21:34,657 --> 01:21:40,663
* Try to remember,
and if you remember

1158
01:21:40,696 --> 01:21:42,298
* Then follow

1159
01:21:47,670 --> 01:21:53,409
* Deep in December,
it's nice to remember

1160
01:21:53,442 --> 01:21:59,648
* Although you know
the snow will follow

1161
01:21:59,682 --> 01:22:05,388
* Deep in December,
it's nice to remember

1162
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:11,594
* Without a hurt
the heart is hollow

1163
01:22:11,627 --> 01:22:17,466
* Deep in December,
it's nice to remember

1164
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:23,039
* The fire of September
that made us mellow

1165
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:31,514
* Deep in December,
our hearts should remember

1166
01:22:33,382 --> 01:22:35,318
* And follow
