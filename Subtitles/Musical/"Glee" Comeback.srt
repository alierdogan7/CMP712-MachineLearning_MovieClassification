00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:45,536
And when it got to the chorus,

178
00:06:45,604 --> 00:06:48,405
I just opened my mouth and
belted it out with her.

179
00:06:48,473 --> 00:06:50,608
And I have to say,
it felt really good.

180
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:52,676
Sue should join
the Glee Club.

181
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:53,844
I'm sorry?

182
00:06:53,912 --> 00:06:55,479
No, I'd rather be dead.

183
00:06:55,547 --> 00:06:57,047
Yes. She should join--
I mean, you can't join,

184
00:06:57,115 --> 00:06:58,182
but she can sit in.

185
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,416
Yes. Will.

186
00:06:59,484 --> 00:07:02,286
Look, Sue is in a really
bad place right now.

187
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:05,456
And you're always talking about
the healing power of music.

188
00:07:05,524 --> 00:07:07,158
There are studies that show
it helps with depression,

189
00:07:07,225 --> 00:07:08,559
it elevates mood.

190
00:07:08,627 --> 00:07:09,660
I have a pamphlet.

191
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:15,599
Uh... Emma, I don't think
this is a good idea at all.

192
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:17,468
I agree with
SpongeHair SquareChin.

193
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:19,403
It's a stupid idea.

194
00:07:19,471 --> 00:07:20,971
No, no. The football team
did it for a spell,

195
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,073
and that really
brought people together.

196
00:07:23,141 --> 00:07:25,609
Will, and this is
a great chance

197
00:07:25,677 --> 00:07:26,977
for you to keep
your eye on Sue.

198
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:29,013
You know, make sure
the old gal's okay.

199
00:07:31,316 --> 00:07:32,883
Well, you know what, folks?
At this point,

200
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:35,119
to alleviate
my crippling depression,

201
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:37,354
I'd do anything.

202
00:07:38,523 --> 00:07:40,191
[chuckles]

203
00:07:40,258 --> 00:07:41,725
This cannot be happening.

204
00:07:41,793 --> 00:07:43,360
This seems like a terrible idea.

205
00:07:43,428 --> 00:07:46,130
Guys, it's not up
for discussion, okay?

206
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:48,299
Now, it's no secret that Coach
Sylvester has taken her licks...

207
00:07:48,366 --> 00:07:49,967
I mean, just wanky.

208
00:07:50,035 --> 00:07:52,536
And I believe she could use
a little sympathy from us.

209
00:07:52,604 --> 00:07:54,805
Sympathy? From us? Uh-uh.

210
00:07:54,873 --> 00:07:56,907
Yeah, all she's ever done
is make our lives miserable.

211
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:58,676
She got exactly
what she deserved.

212
00:07:58,743 --> 00:08:00,811
You're lucky I left my blowgun
at home, Airbags,

213
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,680
'cause I got a clear shot
at your nonnies.

214
00:08:02,747 --> 00:08:05,850
WILL: Guys, Coach Sylvester
has had her recent setbacks,

215
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:07,918
but she is a proven champion.

216
00:08:07,986 --> 00:08:09,386
Now, we could do worse

217
00:08:09,454 --> 00:08:11,388
than to have that kindf
a winning record in our midst.

218
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:12,489
SUE: Let me break it
down for you.

219
00:08:12,557 --> 00:08:15,059
I am no longer a threat
to you people.

220
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:17,695
All right? I'm just hoping that
your singing and dancing around

221
00:08:17,762 --> 00:08:20,364
will pull me out of
my doldrums and give me

222
00:08:20,432 --> 00:08:22,967
a reason to live.
Is that too much to ask?

223
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:25,202
Guys, it's settled.

224
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,570
Sue's going to be
with us for the week.

225
00:08:26,638 --> 00:08:29,673
Now... I received an envelope
in the mail today.

226
00:08:29,741 --> 00:08:31,141
[murmuring]

227
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:32,843
We know that we're facing Kurt
and the Warblers at Regionals.

228
00:08:32,911 --> 00:08:33,944
Sweet Porcelain.

229
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:35,546
And it looks like this year,

230
00:08:35,614 --> 00:08:37,514
we face Aural Intensity again.

231
00:08:37,582 --> 00:08:39,583
They cleaned our clock
last year.

232
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:40,818
Seems like
the governing board

233
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:43,621
has assigned a theme
to this year's Regionals,

234
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:45,022
and part of our score
will be based

235
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,458
upon how well we interpret it.
This year's theme--

236
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:50,628
"Anthem." Now, who can
tell us what an anthem is?

237
00:08:50,695 --> 00:08:52,029
The bottom of an ant's pants.

238
00:08:52,097 --> 00:08:54,131
So close.
So close. No.

239
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:56,333
An anthem is an epic song,

240
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:58,702
filled with
a groundswell of emotion

241
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,237
that somehow seems
bigger than itself.

242
00:09:00,305 --> 00:09:02,673
Even bigger than the person
performing it.
Mr. Shue?

243
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:04,575
Oh, hey, Sam, I didn't even
notice your new haircut.

244
00:09:04,643 --> 00:09:06,944
Yeah. I've been working
on a new image to go

245
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:08,545
with my new one-man band,
The Justin Bieber Experience.

246
00:09:08,613 --> 00:09:10,814
You've got to be kidding me.

247
00:09:10,882 --> 00:09:13,150
Dude. That haircut makes
your mouth look even bigger.

248
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:15,085
Let her speak.

249
00:09:15,153 --> 00:09:16,720
Look, laugh all you want,
but that kid's an epic talent,

250
00:09:16,788 --> 00:09:17,922
and there's a number
I've been working on

251
00:09:17,989 --> 00:09:19,456
that I've been wanting
to show off.

252
00:09:19,524 --> 00:09:21,358
And I think it
qualifies as an anthem,

253
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:24,094
because it's
just hugely emotional,

254
00:09:24,162 --> 00:09:25,763
and sums up
our generation.

255
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,098
All right.
Let's hear it, buddy.

totally making fun of me
for singing Bieber.

310
00:11:57,612 --> 00:11:59,279
That's because we underestimated
the power of the Biebes.

a mini-god.

of endorphins

on Valentine's Day,
and everything is heightened

325
00:12:26,407 --> 00:12:27,875
and so romantic--
the problem is,

326
00:12:27,942 --> 00:12:30,477
days later, when they come down
from their See's candy high,

327
00:12:30,545 --> 00:12:32,012
they crash,
and everything else,

328
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,514
by comparison, is humdrum.

329
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:35,349
We need the sugary sweet jolt
of the Biebes

Yes. Mercedes, have a seat.

391
00:14:49,684 --> 00:14:53,353
So, I've decided I'm going
to sing a song in Glee Club,

392
00:14:53,421 --> 00:14:54,988
and I need your advice.

393
00:14:55,056 --> 00:14:57,524
Now, as you may know,
I have a background in music.

394
00:14:57,592 --> 00:15:00,527
For a brief period, I
was a tambourine player
for Wilson-Phillips.

395
00:15:00,595 --> 00:15:02,095
What I need to
learn from you

396
00:15:02,163 --> 00:15:04,464
is how to be a diva.

397
00:15:04,532 --> 00:15:07,434
Oh. Well, you've definitely
come to the right girl.

398
00:15:07,502 --> 00:15:09,503
I mean, being a diva
is all about attitude,

399
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,305
something I know
you're not short on.

400
00:15:11,372 --> 00:15:13,774
It's all about sassy fingers
and shaking that weave

401
00:15:13,841 --> 00:15:17,177
and generally, taking
no nonsense from nobody.

402
00:15:17,245 --> 00:15:18,211
Dig it, sister.

403
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,446
<i>Well, I have to say</i>

404
00:15:19,514 --> 00:15:21,682
I'm flattered and shocked
that you came to me.

405
00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:24,117
Oh, come, now, "Ra-chelle,"
it doesn't humble me too much

406
00:15:24,185 --> 00:15:26,119
to say I simply
need your tutelage.

407
00:15:26,187 --> 00:15:29,156
Well, I'll say this-- being
a diva is all about emotion.

408
00:15:29,223 --> 00:15:31,058
In fact, you feel
so much emotion

409
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,759
that it cannot be
physically contained.

410
00:15:32,827 --> 00:15:34,461
Sometimes you have
to close your eyes

411
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:36,396
and turn your head and push,

412
00:15:36,464 --> 00:15:38,966

they're that big!

413
00:15:40,301 --> 00:15:41,735
Wow.

414

is wrong about you.

did she say?

Oh, I don't remember
the specifics, just
something about

417

as you think you are

are horrible.

429

You got me

523
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,447
every which way, and we both
know I'm not the brightest.

524
00:20:09,515 --> 00:20:12,817
So, please!-- what do I
have to do to get with you?

525
00:20:12,885 --> 00:20:14,919
I may have
a proposition for you.

526
00:20:14,987 --> 00:20:16,154
I'll keep you posted.

527
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:25,030
Color Me Mine?

528
00:20:25,097 --> 00:20:28,700
I'll color you
yours any day.

529
00:20:38,577 --> 00:20:40,578
Mm, Sammy Evans!

530
00:20:40,646 --> 00:20:43,148
You are Biebalicious.

531
00:20:43,215 --> 00:20:45,684
How are things going
with you and Quinn?

532
00:20:45,751 --> 00:20:46,584
Fine.

533
00:20:46,652 --> 00:20:48,386
No, they're not.

534
00:20:48,454 --> 00:20:51,256
You and I should,
uh, talk soon.

535
00:20:58,907 --> 00:21:00,641
Sam's an artist, Finn.
An artist?

536
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:03,410
I guess that's why he's
taking you to Color Me Mine.

537
00:21:03,478 --> 00:21:05,145
I told you I needed time
to figure out

538
00:21:05,213 --> 00:21:07,114
what I was gonna do
with Sam, and I did.

539
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,750
I choose him.
Because of The Justin
Bieber Experience?

540
00:21:09,818 --> 00:21:11,885
Look, I thought it was
gonna be stupid, too,

541
00:21:11,953 --> 00:21:14,288
but he was so... shameless.

542
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,990
He just got up there
and owned it.

543
00:21:17,058 --> 00:21:18,492
It was sexy.

544
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,361
I'm sorry, Finn.

545
00:21:20,428 --> 00:21:23,163
But like I said,
Sam's an artist,

546
00:21:23,231 --> 00:21:26,233
and at the end of the day...

547
00:21:26,301 --> 00:21:29,036
[whispers]:
it really turns me on.

548
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:35,876
[grunting]

549
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:41,215
[grunting]

550
00:21:45,754 --> 00:21:47,054
[whistle blows]

551
00:21:52,794 --> 00:21:55,996
Do dudes ever get erections
when they wrestle with you?

552
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,298
Shut it, Puckerman--
we're here to talk business.

553
00:21:58,366 --> 00:21:59,633
Sorry.

554
00:21:59,701 --> 00:22:02,770
Okay, I want to do
a number for Glee Club.

555
00:22:02,837 --> 00:22:05,005
It's stage one
of my master plan.

556
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,441
Shibby. So what, you want me
to back you up on my ax?

557
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:10,511
Yeah, but I also
need some advice.

558
00:22:10,578 --> 00:22:13,781
I'm a little bit nervous about
singing in front of a crowd.

559
00:22:13,848 --> 00:22:16,517
Up until now, I've only really
sung in the steam shower.

560
00:22:16,584 --> 00:22:18,452
Hot. But ridiculous.

561
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,888
I mean, you're the most
confident chick I know.

562
00:22:20,955 --> 00:22:22,656
Yeah, I know
I'm hot melted butter,

563
00:22:22,724 --> 00:22:24,825
but singing's different,
and I want to be great.

564
00:22:24,893 --> 00:22:26,927
Or at least as good as Barry.

565
00:22:26,995 --> 00:22:28,462
I get nervous
before I sing, too.

566
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,830
But I always overcome.

567
00:22:29,898 --> 00:22:31,632
You want to know my secret?

568
00:22:31,699 --> 00:22:33,267
Yeah.

569
00:22:33,334 --> 00:22:34,568
Oldest trick in the book.

570
00:22:34,636 --> 00:22:35,736
Just picture the audience
in their underwear.

571
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:36,870
Even the dudes?

572
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,105
It's not about sex.

573
00:22:38,173 --> 00:22:39,873
It's just about
seeing the audience

574
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:40,974
as more vulnerable
than you.

575
00:22:41,042 --> 00:22:42,676
Trust me.
It works every time.

576
00:22:42,744 --> 00:22:43,844
Can I touch your
knockers now?

577
00:22:43,912 --> 00:22:45,312
Only if you want
to lose a hand.

578
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,614
But you're on your way.

579
00:22:50,418 --> 00:22:51,485
[bell ringing]

580
00:22:53,021 --> 00:22:55,823
Remember, I want this
diva-off to be a bloodbath.

581
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:58,725
Oh, trust.
It's about to go down.

582
00:22:58,793 --> 00:23:00,194
You look amazing.
I really do.

583
00:23:00,261 --> 00:23:01,628
This look has
to go viral.

584
00:23:01,696 --> 00:23:03,363
Is there any way you can cut
class for the rest of the day,

585
00:23:03,431 --> 00:23:04,765
just so that you could
walk down the halls?

586
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:06,333
Totally. Most teachers
think by cutting class,

587
00:23:06,401 --> 00:23:07,334
I might improve
my grades.

588
00:23:07,402 --> 00:23:08,469
Great.

589
00:23:08,536 --> 00:23:10,370
TINA: Why are you
dressed like that?

590
00:23:10,438 --> 00:23:12,139
I thought you weren't
into the Biebster.

591
00:23:12,207 --> 00:23:13,874
Well, I wasn't, but
then somebody told me

592
00:23:13,942 --> 00:23:15,776
that Justin Bieber's,
like, the king of YouTube

593
00:23:15,844 --> 00:23:17,377
with over a
billion views.

594
00:23:17,445 --> 00:23:19,646
An anthem is supposed to
appeal to the masses, right?

595
00:23:19,714 --> 00:23:21,482
So before I pick my anthem,

596
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:23,717
I was working
on my anthem look.

597
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,991
Okay, guys and gals!
And Sue.

598
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:32,726
It's the moment we've
all been waiting for.

599
00:23:32,794 --> 00:23:34,328
Our next diva-off.

600
00:23:34,395 --> 00:23:37,231
So here they are, sure
to give us a fantastic anthem,

601
00:23:37,298 --> 00:23:38,765
Mercedes and Rachel.

602
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:39,800
Let's give it up!

603
00:23:39,868 --> 00:23:41,268
[scattered cheers, applause]

604
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:44,004
Uh, after much argument,
I finally convinced Mercedes

605
00:23:44,072 --> 00:23:45,672
that in order to do
a proper diva-off,

606
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,741
it has to come from
the Broadway catalogue.

607
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:49,142
Which I think
is safe to say

608
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,878
that that gives me
a home field advantage, so...

609
00:23:50,945 --> 00:23:52,045
Oh, wellyou're about
to get beat on your own turf.

610
00:23:52,113 --> 00:23:53,447
Hit it.

Not the point
of Glee Club, Sue.

[bell ringing]

665
00:26:43,051 --> 00:26:45,786
I understand you
wish to see me.

666
00:26:45,853 --> 00:26:47,287
Yeah, Sue, I did.

667
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,623
I saw how you were
in class today.

668
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,258
What are you doing
tomorrow night?

669
00:26:51,325 --> 00:26:52,292
I want to take you somewhere.

670
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,894
No. No. No way.

671
00:26:53,961 --> 00:26:55,896
I don't care how depressed I
am, I will not date a curly.

672
00:26:55,963 --> 00:26:58,432
Not on a date, Sue.

673
00:26:58,499 --> 00:26:59,800
Still probably
not going to go.

674
00:26:59,867 --> 00:27:01,535
You're interested in
making your comeback, right?

675
00:27:01,602 --> 00:27:04,638
Well, I think it's important
that you see something.

676
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:11,213
Hate 'em.
Hate hospitals, William.

677
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:12,948
That's why I keep voting
for those death panels.

678
00:27:13,016 --> 00:27:14,183
Sue, I know you.

679
00:27:14,251 --> 00:27:15,651
You crack jokes whenever
you get uncomfortable.

680
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:17,386
Not really joking, William.

681
00:27:17,454 --> 00:27:19,855
And you have a penchant for
sappy scenarios set to music,

682
00:27:19,923 --> 00:27:21,590
so I demand to know
where we're going.

683
00:27:21,658 --> 00:27:23,425
We're going to the
pediatric cancer ward.

684
00:27:23,493 --> 00:27:25,227
No, no, no-- once a month,
I come down here,

685
00:27:25,295 --> 00:27:26,595
and I sing songs
with some of the kids

686
00:27:26,663 --> 00:27:27,696
getting long-term care.

687
00:27:27,764 --> 00:27:28,864
Yep. No.

688
00:27:28,932 --> 00:27:30,499
No. Sue.

689
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:31,734
Uh, William...

690
00:27:31,801 --> 00:27:33,335
I know what
you're getting at.

691
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:34,770
I have been selfish.

692
00:27:34,838 --> 00:27:36,672
Yes, I was ridiculed
on the national stage,

693
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,173
but you're right,
that's nothing

694
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:40,276
when you compare it to what
many people have to deal with

695
00:27:40,343 --> 00:27:42,911
and come back from.

to your father.

878
00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:24,913
Okay, you know what?
Let's just cut to the chase.

879
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:26,415
Despite the fact

880
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:28,850
that your mouth-to-face ratio
is, like, way off,

881
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:30,852

manage to be cute.

882
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,320
But make no mistake,

883
00:34:32,388 --> 00:34:34,623
every time you open
your humongous mouth

884
00:34:34,691 --> 00:34:36,591

or moisten

885
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,727

for a lazy giant,

886
00:34:38,795 --> 00:34:41,263

to everyone seeing

887
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,231

actually a dork.

888
00:34:43,299 --> 00:34:44,800

891

892

893
00:34:53,576 --> 00:34:55,510

she cheated on you.

894
00:34:55,578 --> 00:34:56,878
No, she didn't.

895
00:34:56,946 --> 00:34:59,181
Look, I know you're as dumb
as a bag of wet hair,

896
00:34:59,248 --> 00:35:01,016
but you know in your
heart she's lying.

897
00:35:01,084 --> 00:35:02,851
That gumball story
was insane.

898
00:35:02,919 --> 00:35:04,519
You're choosing
to believe it

899
00:35:04,587 --> 00:35:07,222
so you can still
be with her.

919

to perform an anthem?

Well, I'll admit

00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:00,292

to the house was sad;

But I'm not gonna
go it alone--

924
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,397
the whole crew
has to sing it with me.

925
00:36:05,465 --> 00:36:07,066
And here's the catch:

926
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:08,400
no more Bieber,

927
00:36:08,468 --> 00:36:11,570
no hoodies,
no pocket Lesbian Bieber hair.

928

00:41:19,078 --> 00:41:20,345
someone much better.

1051
00:41:20,413 --> 00:41:21,780
And you've inspired me, Will.

1052
00:41:21,848 --> 00:41:24,316
You've made me realize
I have more to offer the world

1053
00:41:24,384 --> 00:41:25,917
than coming up
with spectacular,

1054
00:41:25,985 --> 00:41:27,552
life-threatening
cheerleading tumbles.

1055
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,488
I got the music in me.

1056
00:41:29,555 --> 00:41:31,390
Sue, that is great.
[chuckles]

1057
00:41:31,457 --> 00:41:34,226
I mean, with that attitude, you
are welcome in here anytime.

1058
00:41:34,293 --> 00:41:37,562
Oh, I couldn't do that; it'd
be spying on the competition.

1059
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,797
What?

1060
00:41:38,865 --> 00:41:40,198
No one told you?

1061
00:41:40,266 --> 00:41:41,933
I got a part-time gig.

1062
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:44,836
Yeah, I'm the new coach
for Aural Intensity.

1063
00:41:44,904 --> 00:41:46,304
That's impossible.

1064
00:41:46,372 --> 00:41:47,539
Oh, nothing's impossible, Will,

1065
00:41:47,607 --> 00:41:48,974
when you have
a positive attitude.

1066
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:50,142
You taught me that.

1067
00:41:50,209 --> 00:41:51,910
Isn't it great?

1068
00:41:51,978 --> 00:41:54,446
Geez, I got
my mojo back,

1069
00:41:54,514 --> 00:41:57,215
still get to dedicate my life
to destroying yours.

1070
00:41:59,419 --> 00:42:00,385
Life's good.

1071
00:42:02,155 --> 00:42:03,622
See you at Regionals.

1072
00:42:09,429 --> 00:42:10,462
[bell rings]

1073
00:42:12,331 --> 00:42:14,332
You must be happy.

1074
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,801
Why is that?

1075
00:42:15,868 --> 00:42:17,102
Quinn is back
on the market.

1076
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:19,237
She'll be easy pickings
after what Sam did to her.

1077
00:42:19,305 --> 00:42:20,672
I don't want to
talk about Quinn.

1078
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,873
I want to talk
about you.

1079
00:42:21,941 --> 00:42:23,275
You were right
in there today

1080
00:42:23,342 --> 00:42:25,277
about that number not
being good enough to win.

1081
00:42:25,344 --> 00:42:26,945
We need to write
our own songs.

1082
00:42:27,013 --> 00:42:29,147
Why didn't you say that
when I needed you?

1083
00:42:29,215 --> 00:42:30,382
It wouldn't have
made a difference.

1084
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,017
The only way to prove
it to those guys

1085
00:42:32,085 --> 00:42:34,586
is to write a great
song and shove it
down their throats.

1086
00:42:34,654 --> 00:42:38,290
Well, do you think that you
and I should do it together?

1087
00:42:38,357 --> 00:42:40,659
No, I think you
should do it yourself.

1088
00:42:40,727 --> 00:42:43,228
Let's face it, you're the real
trendsetter in there, and...

1089
00:42:43,296 --> 00:42:46,198
if someone was gonna write
a song to win Regionals,
it would be you.

1090
00:42:46,265 --> 00:42:48,467
Do you really believe
in me that much?

1091
00:42:48,534 --> 00:42:49,968
More.

1092
00:42:55,241 --> 00:42:56,908
You know...

1093
00:42:56,976 --> 00:42:59,811
I really like the Rachel
that I saw in there today.

1094
00:42:59,879 --> 00:43:03,448
Reminded me
of the old you.

1095
00:43:03,516 --> 00:43:05,917
Focused and
take no prisoners.

1096
00:43:08,988 --> 00:43:10,989
I think she might be
making a comeback.

1097
00:43:11,057 --> 00:43:19,931
