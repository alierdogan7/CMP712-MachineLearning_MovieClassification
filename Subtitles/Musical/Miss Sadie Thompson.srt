This island looks volcanic.

It is,
in more ways than one.

50
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:39,859
All these isolated islands where
our servicemen are stationed are volcanic.

51
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,569
It takes constant vigilance
to keep them under control.

52

You mean to keep friendly relations
with the natives strictly friendly.

00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:59,325
Okay, but you got till 1100 exact.
Then I take over.

175
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,202
All right.

176
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:03,954
So what do you
put in this stuff?

177
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,956
The more you drink,
the more you got to drink.

178
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,475
It's the heat.
It draws it right out.

179
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,962
There's enough sweat in the South Pacific
to float a battleship.

180
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,680
Sorry, I guess that
hit you kind of rough.

181
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,002
I don't mind.

182
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,588
A guy sort of forgets
how to talk to a girl

183
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,797
who's got stockings on.

184
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,008
You're doing okay.

185
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:23,220
- Where you heading for, Sadie?
- New Caledonia.

186
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,647
Got a job waiting for me.

187
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,315
What's it like
down there?

188
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,018
The exhaust pipe
of the world. Hot.

189
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,978
This rock's a deep freeze,
compared.

190
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,984
It's jumping.
Anything goes.

191
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,315
You won't like it.

192
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,991
(speaking Japanese)

193
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,319
As the Japanese say,
I should worry.

194
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,496
It's not the first time
I've been away from home.

195
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,494
And I haven't
been run over yet.

196
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,575
OFFICER: Open up.
Open the door!

197
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,328
Two meatheads bearing this way.

198
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,505
They see you
with Sadie's gear?

199
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,877
I don't know.
I tried to dodge them.

200
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,333
Yeah, yeah.
By leading them here.

201
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,339
I'm in the middle
of the street!

202
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,216
What do you want me to do,
evaporate?

203
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:01,095
Lock the doors. Get the place secure,
on the double.

204
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:04,518
CHUNG:
Hey!

205
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:06,688
(Chung shouting)

206
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:07,889
All secure!

207
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:12,648
(baby crying)

208
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,446
I'll cable the Mission Board to
send you a new X-ray machine.

209
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,114
Thank you, sir.

210
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,657
(speaking foreign language)

211
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,377
Anything else I can get for you,
Reverend?

212
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,329
If you could arrange for
more penicillin and Bibles.

213
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:31,504
I'm happy to say
the old ones are worn from use.

214
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:35,254
WOMAN
(speaking foreign language):

215
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,176
I'll see you get
everything you need.

216
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,878
There's no point
to a tour of inspection

217
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,713
if some good doesn't
come of it, is there?

218
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,219
No, sir.

219
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,509
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

220
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,061
Never expected a mission hospital
to be so well-equipped.

221
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,558
Never was until Mr. Davidson

222
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,891
became head of the mission board
for the island.

223
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,395
Having lived in the tropics
all my life,

224
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,569
gives me a certain amount
of persuasive power

225
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:57,397
with those of our trustees
who have never been south of Boston.

226
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,733
You seen to have tropical diseases
under control.

227
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,568
Physical ailments
are simple to fight.

228
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:02,652
Simple?

229
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,574
Compared to immorality and evil.

230
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,076
Although, from what you tell me,
Reverend,

231
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,907
matters seem to have
improved considerably here.

232
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,663
Yes, Mr. Davidson.
Yes, indeed.

233
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,789
(bell tolls)

234
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,370
I presume it's time for services.

I didn't notice any evidence
of disrespect.

262

wants beer, she gets it.

No, I don't want
to get him into trouble.

Now cut it out!
Leave him alone.

Yes, I am.

No use running, lady.

314
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,668
Your boat's been
quarantined.

315
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,666

320
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,091

I should care.

00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,218
Where do I shack up?
Got any hotels on this island?

You can have the suite

Don't pay any attention
to these guys.

324
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,027
- You come to my Quonset...
- Sure, sure!

325
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,473
Button it up.

326
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,275
There's only one place
to stay on this rock.

327
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,605
Come on, Sadie. Let's get going
before it starts to rain.

328
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,028

341
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,762
Tell them to go away, Ameena.
It's too early.

342
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:03,016
Maybe you no hear who come,
huh? Mr. Davidson!

343
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,347
Davidson?

344
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,852
What the heck is he doing?

345
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:09,652
Joe, wait. Put on pants.
I wash.

346
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,695
Tell him we're sorry,
we're all filled up.

347
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,819
You want me lie
to Mr. Davidson?

348
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:16,697
Joe get into trouble lying
to missionary man.

349
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,325
Ameena,

350
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,404
you're a washout.

351
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:23,582
(yelling, straining)

352
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,872
Ready? Heave!

353
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,453
Hey, what's the matter
with you guys?

354
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,334
You didn't win the war
this way.

355
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,585
You heard her!

356
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,793
ALL:
Heave! Ho!

357
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,424
(dog barking)

358
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,559
(men singing and chattering)

359
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,566
(children chattering)

360
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,486
Hi, there! Hi!
What's your name?

361
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,817
- Mary Horn!
- Betty Horn!

362
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,494
- Tommy Horn!
- Killroy Horn!

363
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,571
- She must be quite a woman.
- O'HARA: Who?

364
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,623
- Mrs. Horn!
- (O'Hara laughs)

365
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,541
Joe Horn!
Get on up!

366
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,210
(rings bell)

367
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,037
Come on, Horn!
Let's go, you old sack!

368
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,839
Chop-chop! Come on, boy!

369
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,041
So this is where I park?

370
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,124
Hey, Horn!

371
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,043
Well!

372
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,719
(speaks Hawaiian)

373
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:21,220
Make the best of things today.
It's bound to be worse tomorrow.

374
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,892
You can count on me to help you
make the best of anything, Sadie.

375
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:26,346
- Me too, Sadie.
- Relax, fellas.

376
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,850
You'll burn out your bearings.

377
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,932
Huh?

378
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,230
(children chattering)

379
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,526
JOE: Take it easy.

380
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,525
Joe, I was just
coming up after you.

381
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,356
I got an important guest
for you. Come on.

382
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,032
- Hello, gentlemen.
- MARINES: Took you long enough.

383
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,577
I hope I don't have
to toss you out again.

384
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,700
Sadie! Sadie Thompson,
meet Joe Horn.

385
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,326
- Hiya, Mr. Horn.
- Hiya. Sadie.

386
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:47,625
One of the worst ex-noncoms
from the 1st Division.

387
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,202
Nice bunch of kids you got.

388
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,413
Yeah, sometimes I wish
they were on another island.

389
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,748
Come on, kids, scram upstairs
and help your mother.

390
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:55,549
Hurry up! That's it!
Hey, scoot!

391
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,797
Joe, Sadie's boat's
in quarantine.

392
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,550
Put her up in the best
you've got, huh?

393
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,006
I just rented all the suites.
I got nothing left.

394
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,887
I'll end up in the barracks yet.

395
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,889
Why not let her shack up
with Mrs. Horn'?

396
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,265
What happens to me?

397
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,891
- But it's only for a week.
- Only?

398
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,564
Hold it, hold it.

399
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,483
Nobody'll ever say I got in
the middle of a happy marriage.

400
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,436
Anything will do,
with a roof over it.

401
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,611
Got it.
Follow me.

402
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:17,939
And this better be good.

403
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:19,582
I been commissioned
to look after Sadie.

404
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,743
Who commissioned you,
O'Hara?

405
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,035
(glass breaking)

406
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,613
(monkey chattering)

407
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:29,451
You son of a... Throwing
a lady in a monkey cage!

408
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,752
(Marines yelling)

409
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,579
Wait a minute, fellas.

410
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,756
It's only Willie, the kids' pet.

411
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,424
Take it out!

412
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,672
Go find yourself a tree, Willie.
Sorry to put you out.

413
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:43,177
Don't unpack nothing, Sadie, till
we get this place squared away.

414
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,802
Oh, it'll take you a year.

415
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:46,350
Ah, we've cleaned up islands
in minutes.

416
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,848
Come on, you jarheads.
Hit it for Sadie.

417
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,851
Take it away!

418
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:54,651
Careful of my record player!
It means a lot to me.

419
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:56,978
Glad it's not a radio. Don't
allow them on the premises.

420
00:23:57,061 --> 00:24:01,191
Haven't heard a commercial any news,
nothing, since I left the States.

421
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,820
- Ho!
- Hey!

422
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,948
Move out of the way,
you guys. Timber!

423
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:06,495
Get Sadie out of here!

424
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,664
Hey, don't knock yourselves out,
fellas.

425
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:10,366
My boat isn't sailing
for a week.

426
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,951
Yeah!

427
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,625

What's cooking, Pop?

432
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:29,889
Round up your brothers
and sisters

433
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,391
and tell them
to scram for home

434
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,722

in the rain.

(Marines and Sadie chattering)

498
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,729
It's that awfully cheap girl
from the <i>Orduña</i>

499
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,978
who kept playing her phonograph
to attract the sailors.

500
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,354
It wasn't only sailors
she attracted,

501
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:07,528
she caught our eye too.

502
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:10,322
I'm sure that everyone was aware
of her presence, Doctor.

503
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,917
MRS. DAVIDSON:
She made certain of that

504
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:13,742
from the very first moment
she came on board.

505
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,328
Behaving so outrageously.

506
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,083
Having all those wild parties
in her cabin.

507
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,740
What on earth
is she doing here?

508
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,042
Waiting for the same boat
that we are, I presume.

509
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,836
I detest being under
the same roof with that girl.

510
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:26,630
It's seems pointless
to go on talking about it

511
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,049
since she has as much right
to be here as we have.

512
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,092
(Marines and Sadie laughing)

513
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:33,466
Doctor, I'm going to the mission
hospital in the morning.

514
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,637
Please feel free
to come along.

515
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,260
I'd like to.

516
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,059
You've done quite a job for
the natives at that hospital.

517
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,511
That's the least of our work.

518
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,154
DOCTOR:
What more could you do for them?

519
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,147
Raise their moral standards.

520
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:47,067
They seem high enough
to make them happy.

521
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,735
No, Doctor. Moral standards
can never be high enough.

522
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,107
Especially here,

523
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:52,189
where all of nature seems
to conspire against us.

524
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:55,116
Everything grows with
a sort of savage violence.

525
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:56,785
Today you see
strange flowers

526
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,988
where yesterday
there were only roots.

527
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,324
Ice, Mr. Davidson?

528
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,909
The old box gave 18 cubes.

529
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:07,587
Not bad for war surplus
I picked up off the beach.

530
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,882
Still works if you
treat it like a dame.

531
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:12,631
I mean, if you
keep it in shape.

532
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:15,087
Please have them turn down
the phonograph, Mr. Horn.

533
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,422
It's giving me
a headache.

534
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:18,382
Sure. Mrs. Davidson.

535
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,223
Hiya, Mr. Horn.
Your climate's lousy.

536
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,599
Sorry, it's the best we got.

537
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,352
Say, don't I know you people?

538
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,183
Oh, don't get up,
you'll only have to sit down.

539
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,019
Yeah, we were shipmates
on the <i>Orduña</i>.

540
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:33,105
SADIE: Isn't it too bad,
that sailor getting typhus?

541
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,906
I guess you have met
Miss Thompson.

542
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:36,279
We haven't
had the pleasure.

543
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:37,780
Mrs. MacPhail, Mrs. Davidson.

544
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:38,985
- Hello.
- How do you do?

545
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:40,116
Mr. Davidson.

546
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,788
Nice to know you,
Mr. Davidson.

547
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:42,785
Miss Thompson.

548
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,117
Sadie, meet Dr. MacPhail.

549
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,998
Glad to know there's
a doctor in the house.

550
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:49,455
Hope you won't need my services,
Miss Thompson. I'm on vacation.

551
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,415
Not me, Doc.
I'm so healthy it hurts.

552
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,466
O'HARA: Hey, Sadie, come on.
We got to shove off.

553
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:55,215
SADIE:
Yeah, I'll be right there.

554
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,672
Um, guess I've held up
the parade long enough.

555
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,051
Miss Thompson?

556
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,099
May I ask where you're going?

557
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,973
Oh, the boys are throwing
a brawl at the Chinaman's.

558
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,680
Say, maybe you people'd
like to come along.

559
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,106
You might have a few laughs.

560
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,558
Wouldn't it be wiser
if you stayed here?

561
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,143
You mean
because of the rain?

562
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,978
I wasn't referring to the rain.

563
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,278
You're not reaching me.

564
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,777
You'll be
the only white woman there.

565
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:19,781
Say, that's real decent of you.
But I wouldn't worry.

566
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,988
A girl gets
just what she asks for.

567
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,823
And all I'm asking for is
company on a rainy night.

568
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,954
Well, if you get lonely,
come on down. Bye!

569
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:28,832
Boy, that jeep ought
to be floating by now.

570
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,004
Whoa! It's coming down
cats and dogs!

571
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,832
If you think this is rain,
wait till it really gets going.

572
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,009
Oh! This won't do anything
for my figure!

573
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,210
Don't need nothing!

574
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:39,843
Why, Private Hodges,
I'm surprised.

575
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,173
Hold on!

576
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,179
SADIE: Whoo! Yeah!

577
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:46,137
Well, to paraphrase
an old saying:

578
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,971
“The situation has landed

579
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:50,774
and has the Marines
well in hand."

580
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,984
(people chattering)

581
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,520
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

582
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,729
Excuse me!

583
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,281
Go away!

584
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:42,360
Listen, when I want you,
I'll rattle your cage.

585
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,989
(Marines laughing, cheering)

586
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,076
Oh!

587
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:51,752
Knock it off!
I told you to fall back!

588
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:53,500
That goes
for the rest of you guys.

589
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,081
Sadie's only got two legs.
You want her runnin' for home?

590
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,258
No, I like to dance
while I can.

591
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,836
Say, how about it?
You and me haven't cut one yet.

592
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:01,920
Not my speed, honey.

593
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,971
Well, just shift gears
and follow me!

594
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:07,847
(Marines cheering, whistling)

595
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:34,878
That girl, Miss Thompson,
I've been trying to place her.

596
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,033
Has she ever stopped on
this island before, Mr. Horn?

597
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,627
Not that I know of.

598
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,969
How are things back
in the States, Doc?

599
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,043
Any better?

600
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,338
In what way?

601
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,594
People still
knocking themselves out?

602
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,971
Faster than ever.

603
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,473
Same old rat race.

604
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:55,103
That's why I never went back
after the war.

605
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:58,482
Everything gone.
Slam, bang, hurry up.

606
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,779
Time is money.
Get it while you can.

607
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:03,357
Don't let up.
For what? Money.

608
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,817
And what's it get them?

609
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,777
High taxes and
a bunch of gadgets

610
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,658
that don't bring nobody
peace of mind.

611
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:09,829
You're quite a philosopher.

612
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:11,327
No, just lucky.

613
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:15,001
Fell for a native girl
and learned a thing or two.

614
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,170
I remember where I saw her.

615
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,667
I'm sure of it now.

616
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,294
DAVIDSON:
Yes, there's no doubt of it.

617
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,467
No doubt of what,
Alfred?

618
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:25,466
She's one of those women
who worked at the Emerald Club.

619
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:27,847
What's that?

620
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,140
The plague spot of Honolulu.

621
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:32,686
That girl worked there.
She's a prostitute.

622
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:35,310
You shouldn't assume a thing
like that unless you have proof.

623
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:38,062
Proof? I was with the police
when they raided the place.

624
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,188
I saw her there.

625
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,019
She might have
come with a friend.

626
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,979
Men didn't bring women
to the Emerald.

627
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:44,531
They went there to find them.

628
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:47,701
That club was an infamous trap
for servicemen.

629
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:52,031
I saw them coming in.
All with one set purpose.

630
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,330
Never smiling.

631
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:56,000
All desire is sad
when it must be bought.

632
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:57,874
I saw girls from all nations there.

633
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:01,048
"Entertainers". Harlots!

634
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,374
The place was a sewer

635
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,006
but I finally forced
the police to close it.

636
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:06,883
The women were to be deported.

637
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,215
Somehow this girl
managed to escape.

638
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,720
You could be mistaken, have
her confused with someone else.

639
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,677
It's obvious she's here
to carry on her trade.

640
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,230
I don't see anything
obvious about it.

641
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,852
Doctor,

642
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:22,186
I've devoted my life to fighting
corruption in these islands.

643
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:24,647
I know the look of immorality
when I see it.

644
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,073
I know the sound of
intolerance when I hear it.

645
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:30,072
Passing judgment on others
without absolute proof.

646
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,573
Robert, please.

647
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:32,870
Excuse me.

648
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,457
Doctor, if a man had
a gangrenous foot.

649
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:37,205
What proof would you need
to cut it off?

650
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:39,252
Gangrene is a matter of fact.
It can be seen.

651
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,704
- It's tangible.
- So is evil.

652
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,256
To me it has always seemed
a matter of definition.

653
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:46,255
Evil is a fact!
Like right and wrong.

654
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,007
I know what you think,
Doctor.

655
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,554
That there's no such thing
as immorality.

656
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,051
That everything is relative.

657
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:53,930
I know what you and other men
of science believe.

658
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:56,387
What Freud, Adler and Jung
have brought on the world.

659
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,221
Destroying moral values.

660
00:34:58,305 --> 00:34:59,682
Now, just a minute.

661
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:00,811
Destroying moral values!

662
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,392
Leading people to believe that

663
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,728
they're not directly responsible
for their actions.

664
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,108
But we are responsible.

665
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,781
Each one of us must choose
between good and evil.

666
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,359
We must isolate evil.

667
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,116
Stamp it out, the way you fight
an infectious disease.

668
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:16,289
MRS. DAVIDSON: Alfred, there's
no need to get so upset.

669
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,617
I'm not.
I simply know where I stand.

670
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,078
On the side of right.

671
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:22,708
Good night, Doctor.

672
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,130
Good night.

673
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:27,379
Mrs. MacPhail.
We'll see you in the morning.

674
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:32,135
And of course that invitation to
visit the native hospital still holds.

675
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,557
I appreciate that,
Mr. Davidson.

676
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,973
Just because Sadie's
a breezy dame,

677
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:44,810
what right has Davidson got to
figure she's out of some joint?

678
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,270
I'm afraid
he can't help it.

679
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:47,946
How do you mean, Doc?

680
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:50,615
Fanatics are often too obsessed
by what they fight against

681
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,613
to know why
they're really fighting it.

682
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:53,818
Oh!

683
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,996
You mean like a guy
who's against drinking

684
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,665
but what he really wants
is to hit the bottle?

685
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,617
Yes. Yes.

686
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,418
All of us have hidden desires,

687
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,792
which we disguise
in one way or another.

688
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:08,546
Robert, why must you always
be diagnosing everybody?

689
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:09,968
That put the lid on it.

690
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,295
Not quite.

691
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:13,005
I still have one more
diagnosis to make,

692

Let go now.

Feel that heat.
Help me out of this, will you?

753
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:23,153
Bet my room's like a griddle.
Hey, why don't we park in here?

something cold to drink.

where is the sack hound?

762
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:43,222
How about some beer on ice
for Sadie, huh?

763
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:44,720
Yeah, make it five.

764
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,722
Only this time, its my treat.
No arguments.

765
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,769
Look, why don't you
call it a night?

766
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:51,849
It's kind of late, and I've got
fancy guests upstairs.

767
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:55,105
Complaint registered. Let's go
to my private suite, gentlemen.

768
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,061
If it's okay with you.

769
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:59,773
- If you keep it quiet.
- SADIE: Promise!

770
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:03,368
Take a load off everybody.
Relax.

771
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:04,569
Anybody scared of the dark?

772
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,326
Me.
How about holding my hand?

773
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,907
O'HARA:
No cracks.

774
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,459
That's enough light,
Sadie. It's hot.

775
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,174
Help yourself to
what's left of the bottle.

776
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,671
I think it's
on the dresser.

777
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,249
Yeah, it's still there.
Who wants a drink?

778
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:19,255
Just pass it.
Pass it.

780
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:22,470

mention the heat.

781

Boy, what a night!

782
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,050

You want anything, Sadie?

784
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,762

she'll ask me.

00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,597

the rest of you guys.

786
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:37,561

You, you and you.

787
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:39,112
Anybody got a cigarette?

788
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:42,361
Oh, anything for you, honey.

789
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,783
Mm.

790
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:48,284
Boy, I ain't had me a time like
this since we left Honolulu.

791
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:49,580
You remember Honolulu?

792
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:52,125
Yeah, what a time.

793
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,420
What a time. No place like it.

794
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:57,714
O'HARA: Remember those
clip joints we went to?

795
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:01,384
MARINE: And those dames
in all of them. What dames!

796
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,631
I'll never forget the one...

797
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,178
Come off it, you guys.

798
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,551

I can't do that,
Mr. Davidson.

826
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,763
- It's your hotel.
- Miss Thompson paid her rent.

827
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:59,471
She has a right to invite her friends in
same as anybody else.

Nice to see you again.

Know all the boys here?

831

All right, you men,
leave this room.

832
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:13,826
- Huh?
- What did you say, Mr. Davidson?

833
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,653
You've no business in here,
any of you.

834
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,659

of mine. I invited them in.

O'HARA:
What's the complaint, mister?

836
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,497
Leave this room, or I'll report you
to your commanding officer.

SADIE: They'll leave when they like.
Nobody invited you in!

838
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:26,172
You're a disgrace to your uniforms
being in this room with that woman.

839
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:27,624
- Now get out.
- What did you say?

840
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:29,307

I'll fight you right...

SADIE:
Stop it, O'Hara! Stop it!

843
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,764
Will you cut it out?

844
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,387
O'Hara, stop!

845
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,594
That's enough. Stop it!

846
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:44,232
Did you hear what he said?
Huh?

847
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,356
(muttering)

848
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:51,406
You need to apologize
instead of yelling at me.

849
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,199
Take it easy, Sarge.
You wanna get hurt?

850
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:56,369
You crazy or what?
Trying to hit a civilian?

851
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:57,866
The party's over, O'Hara.

852
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,322
You bet it is.

853
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:02,375
Now, come on. Fold up.
I don't wanna be put off-limits.

854
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:04,748
If anybody was off-limits,
he was.

855
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,545
I'd be careful, Sadie.

856
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:09,545
He's a pretty important person
on these islands.

857
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:11,376
Davidson busted
a lot of people

858
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:14,588
who tried
to stand up against him.

859
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:19,722
He can buy and sell
anything or anybody.

860
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,223
I wouldn't attract his attention
any more than I had to.

861
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,681
Attract his attention?
He'd better not attract mine.

862
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:26,687
I've never known anyone
like him, and I don't wanna.

863
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:30,396
Come on. Call it a night before
Davidson shuts me up for good.

864
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:33,231
We were just warming up, Horn.
Good night, Sadie.

865
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:35,237
- Good night.
- Good night.

866
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:36,943
Come on, hurry up.

867
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:40,742
What a gal, huh?

868
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:43,995
- See you.
- What a gal.

869
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:47,086
- Where you going?
- I got to see Sadie.

870
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,414
- You just saw her.
- I wanna see her again.

871
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:51,591
Hurry up.
You guys wait outside.

872
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:53,668
Sadie?

873
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:57,721
Forget something?

874
00:45:57,797 --> 00:45:59,014
Yeah.

875
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,933
To say good night personally.

876
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,260
Night.

877
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:05,768
I guess I was kind of loaded
when I roughed up Davidson.

878
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,393
Kind of?

879
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:10,147
Did I say something
I shouldn't to you?

880
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:11,944
Perfect gentleman.

881
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,943
Okay.
That's all I wanna know.

882
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,820
- Good night.
- Good night.

883
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:20,494
- Come on, will you?
- Sadie? Sadie?

884
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:24,619
What did you forget
this time?

885
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,827
Tomorrow I'm off duty
at 10:00.

886
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,412
Can I pick you up for a swim
if it don't rain?

887
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,497
Supposing it does?

888
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,628
I'd still pick you up.

889
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:35,551
That's what I figured.

890
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:41,174
Come on, O'Hara. Get out here.
You wanna get me in trouble?

891
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:43,760
Did I say something
I shouldn't have?

892
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:45,595
Good night,
O'Hara.

893
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:49,565
(rain pattering)

894
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:59,325
(car engine starts)

895
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,572
Mr. Horn?

896
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:23,966
Mr. Horn?

897
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,309
Well, did the rain
cool you off, mister?

898
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:38,857
Say, what got into you,
busting into my room like that?

899
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,486
One of the boys really gonna
let you have it.

900
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,366
I had no other choice
under the circumstances.

901
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:44,787
What are you talking about?
"No other choice."

902
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,864
Who was bothering you anyway?

903
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:49,917
I'm afraid I can't let you
carry on as you wish.

904
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,878
Just what do you mean by that?

905
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:55,998
You lived in Honolulu,
didn't you?

906
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:59,336
Yeah, what about it?

907
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:01,216
What did you do there?

908
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:02,888
I had a job.

909
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,590
What kind of a job?

910
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:07,392
Part of the time,
I had a sort of singing job.

911
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:10,722
My voice isn't so awful
if you don't listen too hard.

912
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:13,141
Where did you work?

913
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:16,402
You mean
where did I sing?

914
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:18,400
I mean where did you work
in Honolulu?

915
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:20,906
Lots of places.

916
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:23,404
What places?

917
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:24,906
Nightclubs, mostly.

918
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:27,955
- What nightclubs?
- All kinds.

919
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,624
Why all these questions,
Mr. Davidson?

920
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,918
Why did you leave Honolulu?

921
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,495
Guess I wanted a change.

922
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,626
I've got a job waiting for me
in New Caledonia.

923
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:39,083
You wanted a change.
I'll tell you why.

924
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,447
Listen, I don't know why
I'm getting all this attention...

925
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:44,221
You're going to New Caledonia
to carry on your trade.

926
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:45,639
I don't know what
you're talking about.

927
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,594
I'm talking about why you
had to leave Honolulu.

928
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,886
You're a prostitute!

929
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:51,061
What?!

930
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:53,936
Who do you think you are,
calling me names?

931
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,231
You're a dirty rotten liar!

932
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:57,105
I'll want to give you
a chance to redeem yourself.

933
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:00,529
- Where do you get off with that talk?
- A chance to find salvation.

934
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:01,947
You're no priest or missionary!

935
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,615
You act like one,
but the collar don't fit!

936
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:04,811
Insulting me won't help you.

937
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:07,578
I've listened to you all I'm going to.
Now, you listen to me!

938
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:11,203
You lay off, or I'll show you what
it means when I start to get mad!

939
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:16,750
SADIE: How do you like that
double-talking, no-good louse?

940
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:19,207
Handing me a line like that.

941
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:22,134
If he starts that stuff again,
I'll really tell him off!

942
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,882
I'll spit in his eye!

943
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,444
(car revs)

944
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:47,151
- Mr. Davidson, sir.
- Governor.

945
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,907
I was hoping
you'd find time to drop in.

946
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,784
I'm afraid this
isn't a social call.

947
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:53,833
I suppose you came to see me
about that disturbance last night.

948
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:55,455
Major Kinner
has just assured me

949
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,457
that the Chinaman's place
will be declared off-limits.

950
00:49:57,536 --> 00:50:00,836
At my insistence. No, this is
something else. Thank you.

951
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:03,009
A disreputable girl
from Honolulu

952
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,506
managed to escape deportation
and get on board the <i>Orduña</i>.

953
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:08,385
She's here now waiting for
the next boat to New Caledonia.

954
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:11,468
I suggest that you
do something about her.

955
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:12,972
I don't see
what I can do.

956
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:15,732
That girl must have a passport
or she couldn't have gotten this far.

957
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:18,687
- Revoke it.
- Not without legal cause.

958
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:20,518
I can't interpret the law
as you see it.

959
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:22,023
It is your duty
to protect the natives

960
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,820
and military personnel
stationed here.

961
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:26,024
This girl is a menace
to the welfare of both.

962
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,358
Why make her an issue?

963
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:30,035
You know we keep this island
well regulated.

964
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,704
I don't understand your concern
over this particular girl.

965
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,657
I suggest you visit
the native village

966
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:35,740
as I did this morning.

967
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:37,376
Ask the counsel to tell you
what effect she had

968
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:38,703
on the young men
and women

969
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:40,834
who witnessed her
outrageous behavior.

970
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:43,632
Do you realize where
this sort of thing leads?

971
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:46,027
Mr. Davidson, don't you think
we're a little more concerned

972
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:48,554
with immorality
than the natives are?

973
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:50,552
My father devoted his life
to the islands.

974
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:53,726
I'm not going to stand by
and see his lifework destroyed.

975
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,724
I'm not trying to destroy
anything, Mr. Davidson.

976
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:57,225
You're making your position
clear enough.

977
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,898
I have the greatest respect and
admiration for men like your father.

978
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:02,022
Truly religious men
who are kind, just, tolerant.

979
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:03,741
Then help me protect
what he accomplished.

980
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:06,064
I'm trying to,
within the limits of my authority.

981
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:09,025
But I must protect the legal
rights of every American citizen

982
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:10,108
who passes through here.

983
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,073
Governor,
I'm not a politician.

984
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:14,996
I wasn't appointed
to my job. I created it.

985
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,120
I envy you.

986
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:20,036
In any event,
this is not a marketplace

987
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:21,917
and we're not haggling
over prices.

988
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:24,124
As far as I'm concerned,
the issue is closed.

989
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:27,255
The decision, of course,
is yours.

990
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:29,507
(door closes)

991
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:58,116
(children chattering)

992
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,872
Okay, kids.
Gum and candy.

993
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:04,375
Folks.

994
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:07,834
- Hi, Horn. Sadie in?
- She sure is.

995
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:12,300
Hey, Sadie, you decent?

996
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:15,258
Decent enough.
Come on in, O'Hara.

997
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:17,059
Compliments of
the quartermaster.

998
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:18,727
Hey, what is this,
moving day?

999
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:19,849
You guessed it.

1000
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,271
Who says
you can't stay? Horn?

1001
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:22,849
Horn's okay.

1002
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:25,935
Don't tell me Davidson's trying
to take it out on you too?

1003
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:27,144
He get you into trouble?

1004
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:29,446
Griped to my C.O.
so I got some extra duty.

1005
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,161
That's why I didn't
get here this morning.

1006
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:32,407
That's okay.

1007
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:34,656
Forget Davidson.
Let's go for that swim.

1008
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:35,952
Where's your suit?

1009
00:52:36,028 --> 00:52:38,122
Hey, don't. I told you
I was moving!

1010
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:39,449
He ain't shoving you out.

1011
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,329
I invited myself
to check out.

1012
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:42,830
Why?

1013
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:46,005
Because I don't like the company here,
meaning Davidson.

1014
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,503
I had a run-in with him
last night after you left.

1015
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,835
What about?

1016
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:52,966
You should have heard him
shoot his mouth off.

1017
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:55,889
He can't do nothing to you.
Why run?

1018
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:58,217
I don't want any trouble.

1019
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,177
You sound scared of him.

1020
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,103
He don't bother me.

1021
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,852
I don't wanna get you
into hot water

1022
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:05,979
every time you drop around
for a few laughs.

1023
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:08,356
You mean you're moving out
on account of me?

1024
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,529
How about letting me
finish packing?

1025
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:13,653
I asked you something.

1026
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:16,827
Let's say I'm doing it
for you and Horn.

1027
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:19,030
I don't make friends
to get them into trouble.

1028
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:21,207
Where do you figure
on shacking up?

1029
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:23,158
Horn said they'd
put me up in the village.

1030
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:25,119
Yeah,
I guess they would.

1031
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,876
- What about a lift?
- What about it?

1032
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:29,878
You got one.

1033
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,267
How much do I owe you,
Mr. Horn?

1034
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:42,265
- Forget it.
- Not me, I pay my way.

1035
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:43,596
A couple of bucks
will do it.

1036
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:44,851
For meals and everything?

1037
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,557
This ain't exactly
the Ritz.

1038
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,484
Look me up in my little grass shack
if you ever get into town.

1039
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,187
Sure will.
Best of luck, Sadie.

1040
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,568
- Give my love to Mrs. Horn.
- Yeah, you bet.

1041
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,155
So long, folks.
Sorry to part company,

1042
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,328
but I've been invited
to stay with friends in town.

1043
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:01,826
- Good-bye. Miss Thompson.
- Good-bye.

1044
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,424
Thank heaven she's gone.

1045
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:23,431
She disturbed Mr. Davidson
horribly last night.

1046
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,478
He despises women
of that kind.

1047
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:27,932
The founder of our religion
was not so squeamish.

1048
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:29,938
Robert, don't joke about
such things.

1049
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:32,145
I don't believe the doctor
meant it as a joke.

1050
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:33,353
No matter.

1051
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:44,365
(goats bleating)

1052
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:47,501
You do it.

1053
00:54:47,576 --> 00:54:51,581
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

1054
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:53,461
Oh, that's good. Can you?

1055
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:57,465
(speaking foreign language)

1056
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,117
All set?
Where do I check in?

1057
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:22,115
It's no go.

1058
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:23,411
What do you mean
"no go"?

1059
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:25,410
I talked to the head
of the native counsels.

1060
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:26,911
Seems they had a brawl there
last night

1061
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,458
after some natives had
a couple too many...

1062
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:30,411
But whats that
got to do with me?

1063
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:31,791
Hey, don't tell me
Davidson was here

1064
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:32,917
and blamed me
for what happened.

1065
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,339
Yes, he did. Come on.

1066
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,337
Well, I don't take no
for an answer that easy.

1067
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:38,464
- I'm gonna go... Let go of me.
- Sadie, it's not use.

1068
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:40,091
They won't put you up,

1069
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,218
and there's nothing you or me
or anybody can do about it.

1070
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,015
What have I got?
The measles or something?

1071
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:46,344
As far as the natives,
are concerned, you're taboo.

1072
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,599
- Taboo?
- Meaning hands-off.

1073
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,932
Meaning they're scared
of Davidson. Well...

1074
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,767
- Well, I'm not.
- Nobody said you were.

1075
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:57,651
We got to get back to Horn's.
Don't worry about it.

1076
00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:01,359
Snap out of it.
You won't be out in the rain.

1077
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:02,363
Sure.

1078
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:03,364
(speaks Chinese)

1079
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:04,285
I should worry.

1080
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,614
That a girl.
Now you're talking.

1081
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:45,528
Oh, please don't get up,
anybody. It's too hot.

1082
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:47,579
- Hi, Sadie.
- Hi.

1083
00:56:57,998 --> 00:57:00,751
Did you see that look
Mrs. Davidson gave me?

1084
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,006
Save me from females.

1085
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,463
- Forget her.
- With pleasure.

1086
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,890
Ooh!
Who turned up the heat?

1087
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,342
It'll rain pretty soon.

1088
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:09,597
How do you know?

1089
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:12,600
Caught a piece of shrapnel
during the war in my leg.

1090
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:15,228
Always tells me
when it's gonna rain.

1091
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:16,559
You see much of the war?

1092
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:19,361
Yeah, enough not to want
to see any more fighting.

1093
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,356
Care for a drink, Sadie?

1094
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,441
Oh, no,
not in this heat.

1095
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:27,698
Help yourself to the bottles
in the suitcase.

1096
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:28,779
No, thanks.

1097
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,864
I don't touch it alone.

1098
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:33,576
You mind if I relax?

1099
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:35,787
No, I don't mind.

1100
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,299
You know,
when I joined the Marines,

1101
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,548
they told me
there'd be days like this.

1102
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:45,129
Hey, it is raining.

1103
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:48,466
Ah, let it. Rain, shine.
It's all the same in the tropics.

1104
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:51,301
You got to learn to relax,
Sadie, like me.

1105
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:53,854
Course, I've been here three years
and you only one day.

1106
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:56,648
But I can give you a few pointers
on how to go native.

1107
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,225
Yeah, yeah. Well,
some other time, Sarge, huh?

1108
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,981
Okay.
I can take a hint.

1109
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:03,189
But, you know, there's lots of
people come here for a vacation?

1110
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:05,990
What you need
is to enjoy yourself.

1111
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:08,194
Well, let's keep it friendly.

1112
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:10,495
Believe me, friendship lasts
much longer than love.

1113
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,914
Yeah, but it ain't as much fun.

1114
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:15,952
I think you'd better go, Phil.

1115
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:18,287
Can't I interest you at all?

1116
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:21,340
I lost my curiosity
years ago.

1117
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:24,339
You know, Sadie,

1118
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:25,465
I like you.

1119
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:26,420
Thanks.

1120
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:27,800
I mean it.

1121
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,631
It's tough trying to tell
somebody you like them.

1122
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:31,467
- You know what I mean?
- Oh, sure.

1123
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:33,268
I'm not asking for a medal
or something,

1124
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,471
I just wanted you
to know how I felt.

1125
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:37,034
Well, that's real
sweet of you, but...

1126
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:38,895
I don't feel like
kidding around just now.

1127
00:58:38,974 --> 00:58:40,191
Who's kidding?

1128
00:58:40,267 --> 00:58:41,860
I said let's
keep it friendly, huh?

1129
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:44,688
Sadie, if you don't like me,
just come right out and say so.

1130
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:47,320
Oh, no, I like you fine.
Honest.

1131
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:49,447
Well, then
what's the matter?

1132
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,028
I was worried about Davidson.

1133
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:53,489
Say, could he stop me
from going to New Caledonia?

1134
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:55,791
I don't see how.

1135
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:58,494
You, uh, got some guy waiting
for you in New Caledonia?

1136
00:58:58,577 --> 00:59:00,796
Oh, no,
I got nobody anywhere.

1137
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:02,544
Same here.

1138
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,545
If you wanna get away
from here in a hurry

1139
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,217
there's a boat leaving
for Sydney in two days.

1140
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:08,842
Australia,
where the kangaroos come from?

1141
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,513
They got people there too.

1142
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:12,307
And I'll be there
in a few weeks myself

1143
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:13,804
just as soon
as I finish my hitch.

1144
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:15,886
I got a deal to go
into the building business

1145
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,266
with an old buddy of mine.

1146
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:18,221
Needs a partner.

1147
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:20,273
Yeah, but
he don't need me.

1148
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:23,192
But work's easy to get and you
can stay with him and his wife.

1149
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:24,190
Oh, I couldn't do that.

1150
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,361
Just till you get set.

1151
00:59:25,437 --> 00:59:26,734
And by that time
I'll be there

1152
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:29,066
and you won't have anything
to worry about.

1153
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:30,867
Look, I pay my own way.

1154
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:33,954
That's what I like about you.

1155
00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:35,406
But all I meant was

1156
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:38,493
if you need any help,
I'll be right there.

1157
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:39,827
What do you say?

1158
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:42,413
You'll be out of here
in two days.

1159
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:44,498
Sure. Why not?

1160
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:47,084
What's the difference where I go
as long as I get there?

1161
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:49,636
- Then it's a deal?
- It sure is.

1162
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:50,928
Australia for me.

1163
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:53,052
(knocking on door)

1164
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,181
What do you want?

1165
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,308
Me? I bring letter
for Miss Thompson.

1166
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:01,185
Sadie, it's for you.

1167
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,232
Who'd be sending me
a letter?

1168
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:05,777
- It's the governor's office.
- Governor's office?

1169
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:08,856
(speaking foreign language)

1170
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:12,905
Sadie, what is it?

1171
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:16,614
An order for my deportation on
the first boat to San Francisco

1172
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:17,788
in three days.

1173
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:20,617
The governor's
departing you? Why?

1174
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,662
For the public good?
What's that mean?

1175
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:24,997
I don't know.

1176
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,629
But I know
who made him do it.

1177
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:29,254
Getting me deported, huh?

1178
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:30,881
- I've got some rights, haven't I?
- Hold it.

1179
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:34,090
I'll show that miserable creep!
Not letting me alone?

1180
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:35,799
I'll make Davidson
change that order!

1181
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:38,681
- Now, you listen to me!
- I'll make him! I will!

1182
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,637
One thing I learned
in the war,

1183
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,597
when the enemy's dug in deep,
try to flank him.

1184
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:45,309
Don't hit him head on.
We'll get around Davidson.

1185
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:46,609
I don't want to go back.

1186
01:00:46,685 --> 01:00:49,689
I don't want to go back
to Frisco!

1187
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:50,943
You're not going.

1188
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:52,490
Once they stamp "deported"
on your passport,

1189
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:54,159
you'll never get out
of the States.

1190
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:55,952
It's a finish for you and me.

1191
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:57,995
There'd be no chance
of getting together then.

1192
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:00,415
I was counting on it.
Me and you in Australia.

1193
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,958
I had it all mapped out.

1194
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:04,081
Mapped out?
But that doesn't make sense.

1195
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:05,458
You don't even know me.

1196
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:06,789
What's that got to do with it?

1197
01:01:06,872 --> 01:01:08,624
A guy could know a girl
all his life

1198
01:01:08,707 --> 01:01:10,050
and never want to get near her.

1199
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:13,129
I know you enough
not to want to lose you.

1200
01:01:28,727 --> 01:01:30,445
I'll talk to the governor
myself.

1201
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,147
Nothing doing.
I got a half interest in this.

1202
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,402
We're going in there
together.

1203
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:35,984
- No! No, I don't want you to.
- Why not?

1204
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:38,147
It'll only make it worse
if you get into trouble too.

1205
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:40,323
Please, Phil,
you got to get back to camp.

1206
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:43,454
Maybe you're right. I don't want
to get thrown in the brig now.

1207
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:44,625
Look, you tell the governor...

1208
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,203
I know how to handle it, honey.

1209
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:47,503
All right.

1210
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:48,455
Good luck, honey.

1211
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,040
That goes for both of us.

1212
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:52,876
Yeah. Yeah, for both of us.

1213
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,337
I'll see you as soon
as I can wrangle another pass.

1214
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:56,797
Yeah, okay.

1215
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:04,601
(jeep engine starts)

1216
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:15,073
I'd like to see the governor,
please. Miss Thompson.

1217
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,991
Just a moment, please.

1218
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:19,406
(light knocking)

1219
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:21,238
GOVERNOR: Come in.

1220
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:28,453
The governor
will see you now.

1221
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:30,755
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.

1222
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:33,918
Miss Thompson.

1223
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,547
Sorry to break in on you,
governor.

1224
01:02:35,627 --> 01:02:37,595
Quite all right.

1225
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:39,673
Guess you know
why I'm here.

1226
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:42,475
Now, look, Miss Thompson,
no need to become upset.

1227
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,803
You're only being asked
to leave this island.

1228
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:46,934
Go home.
That's all the order means.

1229
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:49,266
I don't want to go back
to the States just now.

1230
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:52,068
You see, I've got a special
reason for getting to Sydney.

1231
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:53,690
There's a fellow I'm gonna
meet down there.

1232
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,238
We're gonna get married.

1233
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,190
I mean as soon as he gets
out of the service.

1234
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:59,242
You got to believe me!

1235
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:00,944
If you send me
back to Frisco now

1236
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:03,951
it'll maybe never work out
with us so far apart.

1237
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:08,790
All I'm asking is you let me
stay here a few days more

1238
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,711
so I can catch
the boat to Sydney.

1239
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:13,040
I'm afraid that's impossible.

1240
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:14,249
Why?

1241
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:16,630
What have I done
to be sent back for?

1242
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:19,213
I can't change the order,
Miss Thompson.

1243
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:22,516
Because of Davidson?
Because you're scared of him?

1244
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,968
I heard how everybody
in the islands runs for cover

1245
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:26,223
every time he shows up,

1246
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:27,805
even including you!

1247
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:30,481
I admire your spirit,
but not your tact.

1248
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:32,309
It may not be polite,
but its the truth.

1249
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:34,645
He made you do it by telling
a lot of lies about me.

1250
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:37,151
It's useless to discuss it.
Now if you'll excuse me.

1251
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,949
Sure! Don't even give me
a chance to square myself!

1252
01:03:40,025 --> 01:03:42,995
What did he say?
I've got a right to know.

1253
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:45,071
Yes, you have.

1254
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:46,907
He said you were
a disreputable woman

1255
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,084
who'd escaped deportation
from Honolulu.

1256
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:50,502
It's a lousy lie!

1257
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:52,750
Just because I sang in
a nightclub in Honolulu

1258
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:55,833
that was closed by the police.
What does that make me?

1259
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:57,007
You know something?

1260
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:58,801
It takes a low mind
to think low.

1261
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:01,096
And Davidson's mind
is in the gutter!

1262
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:03,890
He's only trying to do
his duty as he sees it.

1263
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:06,468
I'll show you what I really
came down here for.

1264
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:08,679
I got nothing to hide.

1265
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:11,481
Here. Here's a letter from
my girlfriend in New Caledonia.

1266
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:14,105
It's about that cashier job
I was going to

1267
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:15,481
before I met this fella

1268
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,813
and decided to go
to Australia instead.

1269
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:18,943
Read it for yourself.

1270
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:21,525
No, I believe you,
Miss Thompson.

1271
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:25,033
Then you'll let me stay so
I can catch the boat to Sydney?

1272
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:27,580
I have no objection,
if Mr. Davidson agrees.

1273
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:29,783
But he won't!
You know he won't!

1274
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,038
I'm sure if you explained

1275
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:32,960
then Mr. Davidson
understood the situation.

1276
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:35,710
I've always found him
to be fair.

1277
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:39,384
Forgive me, Miss Thompson,
but as you see, I have a job to do.

1278
01:04:47,926 --> 01:04:50,145
(Horn children singing
“Three Little Monkeys”)

1279
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:54,817
♪ Just be like

1280
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:58,691

Have you had dinner,
Miss Thompson?

1284
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:12,583
No. Thanks. Doctor.
I'm not hungry.

1285
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:15,754
♪ Speak no evil ♪

1286
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:17,877
That was very, very,
very good indeed.

1287
01:05:17,956 --> 01:05:19,833
Now, here we are.
Here's the candy.

1288
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,213
CHILDREN: Thank you!

1289
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:22,509
Say good night!

1290
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,679
- CHILDREN: Good night!
- Good night.

1291
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,097
I hate to interrupt your dinner,

1292
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:28,266
but could I talk to you
for a minute please?

1293
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:29,968
Certainly.

1294
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:31,894
I'm sorry for what I said
last night,

1295
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:34,098
sorry about everything
that happened.

1296
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:36,023
I'm happy you feel that way,
Miss Thompson.

1297
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:37,225
I went to see the governor,

1298
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:39,606
he said I don't have to
go back to San Francisco,

1299
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:41,029
if it's okay with you.

1300
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:43,106
I'm afraid I can't
let you stay here.

1301
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:44,532
All I'm asking
is you let me stay

1302
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:46,109
until I catch the boat
to Sydney.

1303
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:47,785
You don't know
what it means to me.

1304
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:49,454
Just what does it mean,
Miss Thompson?

1305
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:51,873
SADIE: Mr. Davidson,
I'll do anything you want.

1306
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,791
Stay in my room,
not see anybody,

1307
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:54,868
if that'll suit you.

1308
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:57,708
(sighs)

1309
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:00,085
May I see you alone,
Miss Thompson?

1310
01:06:12,844 --> 01:06:15,097
Just what are you trying to
say to me, Miss Thompson?

1311
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:17,353
I'll go anywhere you want.
Anywhere.

1312
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:19,355
Please don't make them
send me back to Frisco.

1313
01:06:19,434 --> 01:06:21,061
Why don't you want
to go back there?

1314
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:23,943
There's-There's somebody
I don't want to see.

1315
01:06:24,022 --> 01:06:25,990
Somebody who'll get me
into trouble.

1316
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:28,159
- What kind of trouble?
- All kinds.

1317
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,953
Oh, you know, when a girl can't
shake off a man who's after her,

1318
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:34,329
a man who's big and important
and wants things his way.

1319
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:36,034
You're being evasive,
Miss Thompson.

1320
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,835
What's the real reason?

1321
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:40,255
- I told you.
- No, you haven't.

1322
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:42,424
Yes, I have.

1323
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:45,756
Mr. Davidson

1324
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:49,339
if you send me back to Frisco,
this man's bound to find me.

1325
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:51,595
You see I once worked for him
in a nightclub.

1326
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,267
We got kind of friendly.
But then I...

1327
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:55,437
Then I got tired of him
and broke it off.

1328
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:57,139
He won't let me alone.

1329
01:06:57,222 --> 01:06:59,190
You're not deceiving me,
Miss Thompson.

1330
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:01,359
Isn't this man you're
running from a policeman?

1331
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:02,606
No. That's not true.

1332
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,028
I can verify it
very easily

1333
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:08,108
by cabling the authorities
back in San Francisco.

1334
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:13,663
The truth is...

1335
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:15,661
I didn't do anything.

1336
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:18,960
This friend of mine, I was
with him when he stabbed a man.

1337
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:22,380
They were gambling, drinking.
A fight started.

1338
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:25,004
The police thought
I was in on it.

1339
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:27,836
So I got away to Honolulu
before they could arrest me.

1340
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:32,883
Mr. Davidson,

1341
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:34,843
you were right.

1342
01:07:34,926 --> 01:07:37,896
I've done a lot of things
I'm not proud of.

1343
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:39,894
But I'm trying to forget them.

1344
01:07:39,973 --> 01:07:42,317
I want to start over,
if you could help me.

1345
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:43,814
I want to help you.

1346
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:47,147
I wanna give you an opportunity
to start a new life.

1347
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:49,107
You mean I don't
have to go back?

1348
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:53,070
You must accept your punishment
for the life you've led.

1349
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:57,574
You ran away to Honolulu and
your past caught up with you.

1350
01:07:57,657 --> 01:07:59,910
When you thought you were
safe here again it found you.

1351
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:01,745
If you go to Sydney,
you still will not escape it.

1352
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:03,705
There is no hiding
from justice.

1353
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:05,665
But I didn't do anything
to go to jail for!

1354
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,750
You lead an immoral life.
You must pay for it.

1355
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:09,802
Only then will God forgive you.

1356
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:11,550
What kind of God
are you talking about?

1357
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:14,007
That's not the kind of God
I learned about in Sunday school.

1358
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,263
The way you figure him out,
he's nothing but a cop!

1359
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:18,470
Miss Thompson, you're caught
in a life of your own making.

1360
01:08:18,553 --> 01:08:21,227
You cannot escape yourself.
No one can.

1361
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:24,276
You will only find peace when
you accept your punishment.

1362
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,944
You tell me, "Be punished.
Go back and suffer."

1363
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:28,943
How do you know
what I've suffered?

1364
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:30,524
You don't know,
and you don't care.

1365
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:31,859
And you don't even
ask me!

1366
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:35,115
You don't want to know!
You'll never change me!

1367
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:38,118
I'd sooner die than let you
make me over your way.

1368
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:39,289
(sobbing)

1369
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:41,788
(rain falling)

1370
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:50,130
(knocking at door)

1371
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:51,461
Nobody home.

1372
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:54,218
It's me. O'Hara.

1373
01:08:54,297 --> 01:08:57,676
Oh, yeah, just a minute.

1374
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:10,772
- Hiya.
- Hi.

1375
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:12,528
I was just about
to hit the hay.

1376
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:15,861
It's nice to see you.
Didn't think you'd be by so soon.

1377
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:17,240
Not soon enough for me.

1378
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,072
What's the scoop.
What did the governor say?

1379
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:22,159
Ooh, just like I figured.
I got to go back to Frisco.

1380
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:24,243
You mean he
wouldn't let you stay?

1381
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:25,920
Couldn't talk him into it.

1382
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,497
Say, how about a drink?

1383
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:29,833
If I could find where you
put that bottle this morning.

1384
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:32,294
What right's he got
to ship you out?

1385
01:09:32,377 --> 01:09:34,254
He's the governor,
isn't he?

1386
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:36,931
Ah, here it is.
Have one.

1387
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,474
I don't care
if he's a governor...

1388
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:40,426
Now, no use getting
all worked up, honey.

1389
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:43,013
Nobody's pushing you around.

1390
01:09:43,096 --> 01:09:44,643
Where you going?

1391
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:47,020
They got laws on this island,
same as back in the States.

1392
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,693
Maybe the governor
don't know it

1393
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:51,362
but he's got to bring formal charges
against you to ship you out.

1394
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:54,316
Don't go and see him.
It won't do any good.

1395
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:56,151
And besides, it'll only
get you into more trouble.

1396
01:09:56,234 --> 01:09:57,656
What am I in now?

1397
01:09:57,735 --> 01:09:59,783
You being shipped to the States
and me heading for Australia?

1398
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:00,862
It's no use.

1399
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:02,202
It's not up to
the governor.

1400
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:05,034
What do you mean
it's not up to him?

1401
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:07,041
Well...

1402
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,372
It just isn't.

1403
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:10,877
Who then?

1404
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:13,335
Davidson, is that it?

1405
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:17,555
It's no use going to him.

1406
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:19,132
I've tried.

1407
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:20,808
He won't let me stay.

1408
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:24,888
Why didn't you say so
in the first place? I'll talk to him.

1409
01:10:31,269 --> 01:10:35,399
(whimpering, crying)

1410
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:44,456
(rain falling loudly)

1411
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:01,974
(turns music on)

1412
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:15,817
(music stops)

1413
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:34,382
(footsteps on stairs)

1414
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:57,105
Yeah, I got to go to jail.

1415
01:11:57,188 --> 01:12:00,692
I don't care about that.
Anybody can get fouled up.

1416
01:12:00,775 --> 01:12:02,743
Put in time and it's over.

1417
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:04,913
But that other stuff.

1418
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:08,116
Working in that Emerald Club
in Honolulu.

1419
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:11,248
That can never wash off.

1420
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,455
What about it?

1421
01:12:13,538 --> 01:12:15,506
Did you work there?

1422
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:18,168
Did you?!

1423
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:20,720
I sang there.
Now, leave me alone.

1424
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:21,967
Sang?

1425
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:23,639
I know the Emerald!

1426
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:26,342
I had a straight job.

1427
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:28,018
Straight job.

1428
01:12:28,553 --> 01:12:30,180
How come you picked
that joint to work

1429
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:32,186
of all the clip joints
in Honolulu?

1430
01:12:32,265 --> 01:12:33,517
It paid the best.

1431
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:35,192
Paid the best for what?

1432
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:38,067
You know all the answers!
Why ask me?

1433
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:42,283
A lot of stuff adds up now.

1434
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:44,827
Scared to let me see
the governor with you.

1435
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:47,405
Scared what Davidson
would tell me.

1436
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:50,241
And perfume. Look at it!
Look at it!

1437
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:57,419
All right, you want to know
the truth? I'll tell you.

1438
01:12:57,498 --> 01:12:58,875
Sure, I worked at the Emerald.

1439
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:01,006
Took the men over
for all they had!

1440
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:02,803
They filled the place,
millions of them!

1441
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:05,883
They lined up in the streets and
all of them came just to see me!

1442
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:07,262
Does that make you happy?

1443
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:15,191
And when you asked me
to marry you, it was like...

1444
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:18,486
It was like God had sent
somebody to take me by the hand.

1445
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:20,563
Marry you?

1446
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:22,319
How could I marry you?

1447
01:13:23,608 --> 01:13:25,360
You're dirty!

1448
01:13:25,443 --> 01:13:27,821
When I think of all the guys
who had their hands on you...

1449
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:32,330
Get out. Get out of here!
Out of here! Out of here! Get out!

1450
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:36,663
Out of here! Out of here!
Get out! Get out!

1451
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:40,000
(Sadie sobbing)

1452
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:44,550
(car engine starts)

1453
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,524
I'm sorry,
Miss Thompson.

1454
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:58,476
Terribly sorry.

1455
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:10,367
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

1456
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:13,871
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

1457
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:17,170
He leadeth me beside
the still waters.

1458
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:19,963
He restoreth my soul.

1459
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:24,715
He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for his namesake.

1460
01:14:24,794 --> 01:14:28,765
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death

1461
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:33,845
I will fear no evil
for thou art with me.

1462
01:14:33,928 --> 01:14:37,808
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

1463
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:40,313
Thou preparest a table
before me,

1464
01:14:40,393 --> 01:14:43,272
in the presence
of mine enemies.

1465
01:14:43,354 --> 01:14:46,278
Thou anointest my head with oil.

1466
01:14:46,357 --> 01:14:49,110
My cup runneth over.

1467
01:14:49,193 --> 01:14:51,662
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me

1468
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:53,910
all the days of my life.

1469
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:59,212
And I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

1470
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:10,010
(knocking on door)

1471
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:11,341
SADIE: Yes?

1472
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:13,677
It's Dr. MacPhail.
May I come in?

1473
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:15,602
- Sure.
- Thanks.

1474
01:15:15,678 --> 01:15:17,680
Glad to see you,
Miss Thompson.

1475
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:19,606
You've become a sort of mystery
to us all,

1476
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:22,026
shutting yourself up in here.

1477
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:24,695
I was just wondering
if you're not feeling well

1478
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:26,568
remember, there's
a doctor in the house.

1479
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:28,695
Thanks, but I'm okay.

1480
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:33,120
That Marine friend of yours,
Sergeant O'Hara, came to see me.

1481
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:36,244
He still wants you
to go to Australia.

1482
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:39,247
Well-Well,
he wouldn't understand.

1483
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:43,957
I'm going back to San Francisco
and face what I've got to.

1484
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,884
Are you sure you're doing
what you want to do?

1485
01:15:47,418 --> 01:15:49,295
Yes, I'm sure.

1486
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:54,133
I understand why O'Hara's
worried about you.

1487
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:55,889
Frankly, so am I.

1488
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:58,596
You needn't worry
about me, doc.

1489
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:00,773
I'm through running,
being scared.

1490
01:16:00,848 --> 01:16:04,022
Letting myself get hurt.
I'm past all that.

1491
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:07,021
I know Mr. Davidson's
been talking to you...

1492
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:09,573
He made me
see things different.

1493
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:12,026
I must say,
Davidson puzzles me,

1494
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:14,532
going from one extreme
to another.

1495
01:16:14,612 --> 01:16:17,866
Yeah, but you've got him
all wrong, like I did, Doc.

1496
01:16:17,948 --> 01:16:21,669
When O'Hara walked out on me
and I had nobody to turn to,

1497
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:23,838
Mr. Davidson helped me.

1498
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:25,836
He showed me
where I was heading.

1499
01:16:26,957 --> 01:16:29,961
At first I didn't listen.

1500
01:16:30,044 --> 01:16:32,718
All I heard was the rain...

1501
01:16:32,797 --> 01:16:35,550
falling harder...

1502
01:16:35,633 --> 01:16:37,055
and harder.

1503
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:40,937
I thought
I was going to scream.

1504
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:47,361
Then I began to listen
and things started to clear up.

1505
01:16:48,646 --> 01:16:51,490
Everything he said made sense.

1506
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:53,488
I didn't feel lost anymore.

1507
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:58,039
I'm back to myself again...

1508
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:01,951
like I was...

1509
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:03,377
long ago.

1510
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:08,833
I think I understand,
Miss Thompson. Good-bye.

1511
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,173
Good-bye.

1512
01:17:24,515 --> 01:17:26,483
(boat horn blowing)

1513
01:17:26,559 --> 01:17:28,812
That's the boat
to San Francisco, isn't it?

1514
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:30,237
DAVIDSON: Yes.

1515
01:17:32,022 --> 01:17:33,239
I'm not afraid
to go back.

1516
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:34,817
Not anymore.

1517
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:37,278
I've searched myself
again and again

1518
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:40,661
to make certain that I've asked
you to do the right thing.

1519
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:43,583
I know there is no other way.

1520
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:46,583
Yeah. I know it too.

1521
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:50,508
Mr. Davidson, when you're
with me, I know it's right.

1522
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:52,426
I'm not scared then.

1523
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:55,755
But when I'm alone and don't
have you to talk to I...

1524
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:58,682
Try to remember me
and all I've said.

1525
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:01,681
Try to remember the peace
you've found.

1526
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,057
Think of this place of communion

1527
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:05,515
where I helped you
to find yourself.

1528
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:10,315
I'd like to go now,
Mr. Davidson.

1529
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:12,237
Yes, Miss Thompson.

1530
01:18:20,863 --> 01:18:23,867
(natives chanting)

1531
01:18:32,249 --> 01:18:35,503
(chanting and drumming)

1532
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:31,025
(car approaching)

1533
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:34,354
(tires screeching)

1534
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:37,652
(footsteps approaching)

1535
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:40,819
(lock rattling)

1536
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:44,371
I was scared you'd gone.
That I'd be too late.

1537
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:47,199
There's a freighter loading
copper sailing in an hour.

1538
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:49,832
I made a deal with the skipper
to take you to New Caledonia.

1539
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:51,510
It's a short hop
from there to Australia.

1540
01:19:51,537 --> 01:19:53,335
Get your gear together
as fast as you can.

1541
01:19:53,414 --> 01:19:55,462
I'm going
back to the States.

1542
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:56,542
Look, there's no time.

1543
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:57,877
What happened between us

1544
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,520
has nothing to do
with you getting away.

1545
01:19:59,586 --> 01:20:03,466
I don't want to get away.
I'm through running.

1546
01:20:03,549 --> 01:20:07,554
Sadie, the last couple of nights,
I've been up figuring,

1547
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:09,388
counting all I've done.

1548
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,269
It added up to one way.

1549
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:13,817
I had no right to sound off.

1550
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:17,359
Honey,

1551
01:20:17,438 --> 01:20:19,281
maybe knowing the worst
about each other

1552
01:20:19,356 --> 01:20:21,779
isn't such a bad way to begin.

1553
01:20:21,859 --> 01:20:24,658
It's got nothing
to do with that.

1554
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:26,159
Mr. Davidson
gave me the courage

1555
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:28,832
to finally face the truth
about myself.

1556
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:31,786
What are you talking about?

1557
01:20:31,869 --> 01:20:33,712
I don't get it.

1558
01:20:33,787 --> 01:20:36,882
Well, Mr. Davidson
said the truth's the truth.

1559
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:39,005
You can't run away from it.

1560
01:20:39,084 --> 01:20:41,257
That's what I've been
trying to do.

1561
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:44,967
Run away from the truth
about myself.

1562
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:48,053
I never wanted to face
what I became.

1563
01:20:48,135 --> 01:20:49,762
I was nothing but a tramp.

1564
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:51,643
I told you it don't matter to me.

1565
01:20:51,722 --> 01:20:53,941
It matters to me!
Don't you understand?

1566
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:55,814
Mr. Davidson says
I got to go back.

1567
01:20:55,893 --> 01:20:57,395
Accept my punishment.

1568
01:20:57,478 --> 01:21:00,948
That's the only way
I'll ever feel free inside.

1569
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:04,406
I already feel better knowing
I'm gonna get it over with.

1570
01:21:04,485 --> 01:21:05,862
Don't make things tougher.

1571
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:07,912
You're getting on that
freighter to Caledonia.

1572
01:21:07,988 --> 01:21:12,038
- Come on. Get your gear-
- No! No. I'm going to Frisco!

1573
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:13,960
Oh, I want to do
what's right.

1574
01:21:14,036 --> 01:21:16,209
I'm telling you
what's right.

1575
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:19,542
That's enough, Sergeant.
Miss Thompson's made her choice.

1576
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:21,719
Choice nothing.

1577
01:21:21,794 --> 01:21:23,967
You got her all mixed up,
filling her with a lot of bilge!

1578
01:21:24,046 --> 01:21:25,514
Well, she's not going
back to the States,

1579
01:21:25,589 --> 01:21:28,433
- I'm getting her out of here.
- Are you?

1580
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:34,724
Sadie, think of yourself.
Honey, that's all that matters.

1581
01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:37,356
No, Phil,
that isn't all.

1582
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:39,402
I know you mean it for my good
and I appreciate it

1583
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:41,230
but you don't understand.

1584
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:42,906
You just don't.

1585
01:21:44,066 --> 01:21:46,785
Now, go. Please go.

1586
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:01,212
(engine starts)

1587
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:04,010
You've made me very happy,
Miss Thompson.

1588
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:07,506
You're strong enough
to withstand any temptation.

1589
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:09,509
You were offered
a chance to escape

1590
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:11,434
and you refused to take it.

1591
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:16,186
I'd better get ready to leave.

1592
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:18,233
Your boat won't
be sailing for an hour.

1593
01:22:18,308 --> 01:22:22,563
I can't stay here anymore.
I just can't.

1594
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:24,398
I'm out of cigarettes again.

1595
01:22:24,481 --> 01:22:26,904
I better get some
to last me the trip.

1596
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:29,494
Mr. Horn?

1597
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:31,413
Mr. Horn?

1598
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:38,754
They're all at the festival.

1599
01:22:38,829 --> 01:22:41,298
It's funny how I'm always
running out of cigarettes.

1600
01:22:44,001 --> 01:22:46,220
Sometimes I don't even know
I'm smoking.

1601
01:22:47,504 --> 01:22:49,097
I guess when something
becomes a habit

1602
01:22:49,173 --> 01:22:51,471
you don't think
what you're doing.

1603
01:23:00,267 --> 01:23:02,565
I'll never forget what you've
done for me, Miss Thompson.

1604
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:06,441
You've justified my existence
by letting me save you.

1605
01:23:07,733 --> 01:23:09,451
You've given me more happiness
than I've ever known.

1606
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:12,029
That's real nice of you,
Mr. Davidson,

1607
01:23:12,112 --> 01:23:14,240
especially after
all the trouble I gave you.

1608
01:23:15,115 --> 01:23:16,833
This time tomorrow,
you'll be on the sea.

1609
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:17,956
Yeah.

1610
01:23:18,035 --> 01:23:20,458
I don't suppose
we'll ever meet again.

1611
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:22,835
I suppose not.

1612
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:25,713
Does it matter,
Miss Thompson?

1613
01:23:25,792 --> 01:23:27,794
I mean,

1614
01:23:27,878 --> 01:23:30,597
you're sure
of yourself now.

1615
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:32,470
Yeah, I think so.

1616
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:37,396
You won't be alone.
I'll be with you wherever you are.

1617
01:23:37,471 --> 01:23:39,269
I don't understand,
Mr. Davids...

1618
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:40,850
Why do you
move away from me?

1619
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:44,358
Well, I just want
to get my things.

1620
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:46,234
I'm ready to go now.

1621
01:23:48,607 --> 01:23:50,359
You're not afraid of me,
are you?

1622
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:51,989
After the last three days
I mean.

1623
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:53,241
No.

1624
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:57,666
No, I'm not scared of you.
Not anymore.

1625
01:23:57,741 --> 01:24:00,290
Then why do you
want to leave me?

1626
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:02,463
It's got nothing to do with you,
Mr. Davidson.

1627
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:06,008
I just want to get started,
that's all.

1628
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:09,511
Oh, no.

1629
01:24:09,586 --> 01:24:11,930
I never wanted you to leave.
Never. I know that now.

1630
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:14,599
No!

1631
01:24:14,675 --> 01:24:18,225
Don't touch me.
Don't come near me.

1632
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:19,395
You're still the same.

1633
01:24:19,471 --> 01:24:21,064
I'm not the same!
Don't you see?

1634
01:24:21,139 --> 01:24:23,392
- I'm not the same!
- You're nothing but a rotten...

1635
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:26,149
No!

1636
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:31,168
(rings bell)

1637
01:25:31,251 --> 01:25:35,097
(speaking foreign language)

1638
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:39,347
Joe? Joe?

1639
01:25:39,426 --> 01:25:42,726
(speaking foreign language)

1640
01:25:49,186 --> 01:25:51,188
Go get Dr. MacPhail.

1641
01:26:02,199 --> 01:26:04,622
MARINE:
Make it snappy, Sarge.

1642
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:10,002
- Horn, you hear Davidson killed himself?
- Yeah, I just heard.

1643
01:26:10,082 --> 01:26:11,709
- What about Sadie?
- What about her?

1644
01:26:11,792 --> 01:26:13,715
She get on that boat all right
or didn't she?

1645
01:26:13,794 --> 01:26:15,514
- I suppose.
- What do you mean you suppose?

1646
01:26:15,545 --> 01:26:16,842
How do you know
he didn't kill her too?

1647
01:26:16,922 --> 01:26:19,300
Come off it, O'Hara.
Sadie's on her way to Frisco!

1648
01:26:19,383 --> 01:26:20,726
Where's Davidson?

1649
01:26:20,801 --> 01:26:23,224
The natives left him on the beach
at the bottom of the cliff.

1650
01:26:23,303 --> 01:26:24,805
You can't help him now, Doc.

1651
01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:27,232
- Did you tell Mrs. Davidson?
- My wife's trying to.

1652
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:30,686
(speaking foreign language)

1653
01:26:30,769 --> 01:26:32,567
Why do you think
a guy like Davidson

1654
01:26:32,646 --> 01:26:33,989
would knock himself off?

1655
01:26:34,064 --> 01:26:37,443
I don't care about Davidson.
What about Sadie?

1656
01:26:37,526 --> 01:26:39,369
I'm gonna get the C.O.
to radio that boat.

1657
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:42,243
(phonograph plays)

1658
01:26:44,408 --> 01:26:46,251
Sadie! Sadie!

1659
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:50,547
Hi.

1660
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:52,420
Hi, O'Hara.

1661
01:26:52,499 --> 01:26:54,422
What brings you
around so early?

1662
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:57,505
Sadie, how come you're not
on the boat to Frisco?

1663
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:02,430
My, my, don't the world
look fresh and clean today?

1664
01:27:02,509 --> 01:27:04,182
Look at that sky.

1665
01:27:04,261 --> 01:27:06,263
Just like a thing
wasn't going on under it.

1666
01:27:06,346 --> 01:27:07,518
Sadie, what happened?

1667
01:27:07,597 --> 01:27:09,520
I'll give you one guess.

1668
01:27:09,599 --> 01:27:13,695
Better turn that music off.
Mrs. Davidson's upstairs.

1669
01:27:13,770 --> 01:27:16,523
Why should I turn off the music
because she's upstairs?

1670
01:27:16,606 --> 01:27:19,075
What do I care about her
or Mr. Davidson?

1671
01:27:19,151 --> 01:27:21,495
- Sadie, somethings happened.
- You bet it has!

1672
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:24,995
I've come back to my senses.
That's whats happened!

1673
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:26,416
You men,

1674
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:28,869
you're all alike. Pigs.

1675
01:27:28,952 --> 01:27:32,502
Sadie, Mr. Davidson
killed himself.

1676
01:27:35,125 --> 01:27:36,593
What did you say?

1677
01:27:36,668 --> 01:27:38,295
O'HARA: Sadie...

1678
01:27:38,378 --> 01:27:42,383
He killed himself?
What are you talking about?

1679
01:27:42,466 --> 01:27:44,434
Sadie, listen.

1680
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:46,102
Let me alone!

1681
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:50,979
- Let me alone! All of you!
- Sadie! Sadie! Sadie!

1682
01:27:51,057 --> 01:27:54,277
(children chattering)

1683
01:27:54,352 --> 01:27:56,571
I don't care why Davidson
killed himself.

1684
01:27:56,646 --> 01:27:58,193
It doesn't matter to me
one way or the other.

1685
01:27:58,273 --> 01:27:59,320
It matters very much.

1686
01:27:59,399 --> 01:28:01,839
What made him take his own life
is of great importance to you.

1687
01:28:01,902 --> 01:28:03,904
I don't care.

1688
01:28:03,987 --> 01:28:06,991
If he hadn't done it, maybe
I would have killed him myself.

1689
01:28:07,073 --> 01:28:08,325
All that fancy gab
he gave me

1690
01:28:08,408 --> 01:28:10,376
about God and faith
and right and wrong.

1691
01:28:10,452 --> 01:28:12,454
- I know how you feel.
- Look, Doctor.

1692
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:15,256
Will you do me a favor
and leave me alone?

1693
01:28:15,332 --> 01:28:17,300
Now, listen to me,
Miss Thompson.

1694
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:19,127
You mustn't confuse
what Davidson did

1695
01:28:19,211 --> 01:28:20,463
with what he believed in.

1696
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:23,139
He just couldn't practice
what he preached.

1697
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:24,842
What does that prove?

1698
01:28:24,925 --> 01:28:28,475
Just the opposite of what you're
trying to make yourself believe.

1699
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:30,521
I don't believe in anything.

1700
01:28:30,597 --> 01:28:34,397
I beg you not to let what
happened last night destroy you.

1701
01:28:34,476 --> 01:28:37,821
It's already destroyed
Davidson.

1702
01:28:37,896 --> 01:28:39,864
One thing he proved
by his death,

1703
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:41,613
nobody can run away
from himself.

1704
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:45,195
You talk like him.

1705
01:28:45,278 --> 01:28:49,124
Do I? I didn't realize.

1706
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:51,167
All of us may run
as far as we can,

1707
01:28:51,243 --> 01:28:55,214
but in the end we always come
face-to-face with ourselves.

1708
01:28:55,288 --> 01:28:56,961
I'll see you,
Sergeant.

1709
01:29:05,423 --> 01:29:09,178
You're going to Australia.
There's nobody to stop you now.

1710
01:29:09,261 --> 01:29:10,808
Nobody, except myself.

1711
01:29:10,887 --> 01:29:13,481
But you don't have to go back
to the States, not anymore.

1712
01:29:13,557 --> 01:29:14,979
That's what you say.

1713
01:29:15,058 --> 01:29:17,652
That's what I mean.
You're okay now.

1714
01:29:17,727 --> 01:29:19,445
From now on,
it's you and me.

1715
01:29:19,521 --> 01:29:21,740
You're heading for Sydney.
You'll forget all this.

1716
01:29:23,275 --> 01:29:26,825
Sure, maybe I will,
but will you forget?

1717
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:30,582
Give me a chance to,
will you?

1718
01:29:30,657 --> 01:29:32,159
Give me a chance,
Sadie.

1719
01:29:32,242 --> 01:29:35,291
(boat horn blows)

1720
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:39,299
Never mind the record player.
Keep it to remember me by.

1721
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:42,093
Don't you worry, Sadie.
We'll remember you.

1722
01:29:42,168 --> 01:29:43,465
- Bye. Phil.
- Bye.

1723
01:29:46,256 --> 01:29:48,634
I'll be grabbing a plane
the minute I get my discharge.

1724
01:29:48,717 --> 01:29:50,970
See you in Australia
a month from now!

1725
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:52,492
MARINES:
Good luck! Good luck. Sadie!

1726
01:29:52,554 --> 01:29:55,649
(Marines saying good-bye,
whistling)

1727
01:29:55,724 --> 01:29:58,819
- So long, Sadie!
- Good-bye!

1728
01:30:00,896 --> 01:30:02,739
Good-bye!

1729
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:06,068
O'HARA:
<i>Bon voyage</i>, Sadie!
