This isn’t treadmill I but suicide machine

But today you’ve done

Life is a cycle. Get, set, go.

75

Help! Help!

76
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:58,044
Very good, Peter. Do it again.

77
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:05,422
Madam, I’m going by what you’re
saying, not by what I see.

78
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,321
It’s ok. You sign.

79
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,293
Madam, handle of pulley broke.

Second hand handle. How many second hand things should I buy?

Even in market I’m calle
second hand.

84
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,268
Even second hand girls approach
me with proposals.

85
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:27,334
Janvi, help. -Look, second hand.. Pinto, help them.

86
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,544

Prem, where.. -At your feet, love.

88
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,381
Prem, your ancestor’s out-dated
gym is running me nuts.

89
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:42,291
Now what? -Madam, even the pulley of handle broke now.

90

It seems I married this

92
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,690
Not a single machine operates properly.

Is my work to fooI
•aII my clients?

94
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,432
Janvi, fooling has become
part of our lives.

95
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,133
Look at Chautala.-Hi.-Hi.

96
00:09:56,195 --> 00:10:00,268
From January to December he’s fooled every month.

You got the notch. It was the onlything Ieftto fit. ___

98
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,674
Wow! The car is ready.

99

Nice.-One minute.

101
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,149
You bought this cylinder with your pocket money.

102
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,252
I knew it. Why do you aIways spend money.. -Janvi.

103
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,257
Prem too has rights on
— his pocket money.

104
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:21,730
Right, Prem? -Yes.

105
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,493
•It was my idea to say to his brother that they were married.

106
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,005
Prem, you always.. -Hi, guys.

Let’s jump. Come on.

112
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,320
Veer, mark my words.

113
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:49,683
When Dharam will know of this
lie, it’ll be very bad.

114
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,194
Not at all.

115
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,489
Everything will be fine
as I’ve got this.

116
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,757
Veer, wear this. This is
•Iucky stone for you.

117
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:00,697
Are you ok?

Bring a stone for him
too. -Whatever.

119
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,021
1. 2. 3.

120
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:26,457
Nice tune.-But it's of no use.

121
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:30,067
We’ve no lyrics for it.
• -Romantic lyrics.

122
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:36,504
It’s very easy for me. -Car mechanic will write songs.

123
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,103
Time for reality check, guys.

124
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:42,737
Prem didn’t woo meIike
— this. He’s very sly.

125
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:22,344
The more I see you, I feel..

126
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:34,125

..my heart beats only for you.

131
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:34,455
What’s my fault if my heart fell for you?

132
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:44,725
For you I’ve forsaken
the world.

133
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:53,811
You’re my love, my world.

134
00:13:55,467 --> 00:14:03,443
These moment are special
as we are together.

Move. Please. -Hey, guys.

138

Entry form for Goa fun fair has been submitted. -Wow.

139
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,971
All credit goes to him
-Awesome, dude.

140
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,075
Yes. -He has good connections.

141
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,209
Give me coffee.-Ok.

142
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,580
My time got wasted
•because of you.

143
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:13,385
Veer, Chris of Aura group was also there. We’ve to be careful.

144
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:18,460
We’ve to be careful. -Forget
it. We’ll see.

145
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:25,230
Look. Think of the devil
and devil is here.

146
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,076
Insolent. You ruined my shirt.

147

I’d to attend meeting. Ar you blind? -Sorry, sir.

148
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,555
Uncle, she’s apologizing.

149
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,784
So will this get cleaned?

150
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,617
It won’t get cleaned if you call her blind.

151
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:54,358
Shut up! Apologize after
— kicking a dog! Wow!

152
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,555
You mean.. which breed, sir?

153
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,795
What do you mean? I’m a dog’?

154
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,166
I was giving an example.
It’s a proverb.

155
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,500
Didn’t your father taught you
how to talk to elders.

156
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,044
Your mother must’ve taught you how to wash clothes. S1

158

Ok. So this is your generation.

159
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,388
These bunchs of fools.
-Take it easy.

160
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:22,150
He’s laughing like a monkey
from british era.

161
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,751
And it’s hard to say if he’s a boyoragirI.

162
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,992
He’s made in China. He’ll be ruined within 2 days.

• I don’t know if he’s holding • guitar or guitar is holding him.

164
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:35,034

a beard like a goat.

You mean I'm tribal?-Yes.

169
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:52,288
Hi, guys. Whom are you ragging?

170

Veer, what have you done?

173
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,025
He’s my father.

174
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:01,993

But dad, I love him. -Come on.

182
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:27,250
Prem, everything got ruined.

183
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,357
You want to solve your problem.

184
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,563
Go to Vidya’s house
and clean it.

185
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,760
Clean his father’
-No, his shirt.

186
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,174
Pal, I don’tthinkthatl shirt could be cleanedJ

187
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:51,808

00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,054
It's Ok.

190
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:05,124
Prem, jf I don’t get married to Vidya..

191
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,788
..my lie will be caught.

192
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:13,467
Brother will break my nose and take me to hospital.

193
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:21,702
You know what, I deserve
this, Prem.

194
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:28,377
Even though a step-brother, he raised him as his real brother.

195
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,314
He supported me at every step.

196
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:34,015
Whatdidlgivein return?

197
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:41,597
To double my pocket money
I lied to him.

198
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,468
I feel like a failure.

199
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:53,339
You know what, I’m a faiIure.

200
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,214
I'm the worst failure.

201
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,548
Exhausted and beaten up.

202
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,255
I understand.

203
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:12,219
But I’m worse than you.

204
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,162
I’m a worthless chap.

205
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:23,338
When I was born, people said I was so naughty and cute..

206
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:28,037
..so my dad named me ‘Prem’(love) with love.

207
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:34,313
But he forgot that surname is Chopra.

208
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,144
Prem Chopra.

209
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:44,150
He died and left this for me.

Chopras 1956. Ancestral gym.

211
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:50,233
Janvi got stuck with it.

212
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:53,436
She’s busy every day without
saying a word.

213
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:03,703
Veer, you know why I want to make car? —

214
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,511
Tell me.

215
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,685
To fill Janvi’s life with happiness.

216
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,452
It’s empty..

217
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,194
Life isn’t so empty, Prem.

218
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:29,137
No, I was talking about
empty bottle.

219

listen to him..

00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,445
..so your ears will be punished.

Ear?cut his ears.

10 Iakh. Why?

312
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:08,070
Because of your words Tobu

And he lost.

314

Veer, tell brother Dharam to pay 5 lakh in advance.

Did your brother learnt about I your fake marriage for 2 years?1

343

But what about Chautala who comes every year.

00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:26,327
Kidnap? Ransom? He’ll

And we’ll be in more problem.

480

Yes, she’s angry. She has all
• the reasons to be angry.

497
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:36,824
I  've not met her.

4 hours deIay.

509
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:11,856
That’s great news.

510
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,198
Let's drink coffee -No!

511
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:18,668

I’ll get it, brother.

517
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:53,204
Prem, come. -Excuse me.

I feel like kissing her.

524
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:29,176
It’s time.. What are you looking at?

525
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,780
It’s Rolex. OriginaI.

526
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:35,681
24 carats gold diamond studded.
It’s worth 2.5 lakhs.

527
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,841
Watches don't excite me.

528
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:42,481
Now that’s what Ical a hot super model.

529
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:43,848
What a piece!

530
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:47,118
I think it's new in market.

531
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,630
I never saw it before.

532
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:52,556
Bumpers are small, but headligthts are good.

533
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:57,130
I wish I could ride her.

534
00:44:58,862 --> 00:44:59,636
What’s your name?

535
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:04,239
Prem. Prem Chopra.

536
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:06,245
Fantastic. It suits you.

537
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:11,316
Tell me, which fool answered
the phone at home?

538
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:14,918
I don't know.

539
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,352
Veer- Yes!

540
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,427
Which fool answered the phone at home?1

541
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:22,428
Prem.

542
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:25,155
Wait.

543
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:29,363
This is royal gift for the king of Yusoto.

544
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,530
Keep the luggage in.

545
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:34,271
We are finished.

546
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:35,399
Don’t worry.

547
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:38,772
Your wife will be arranged before you reach home.

548
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:40,371
How leave it me?

549
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:41,677
Go. All the best!

550
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:48,346
Chopra isn’t coming.

551
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:50,521
He has some work.

552
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,524
Coming.

553
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,796
Hello. -Hello, Mary.

554
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,798
Who is it? - Prem.

555
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:00,869
Sir Prem and sir Veer

556
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:02,399
I'm Prem.

557
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:04,530
Sir, you were at airport.

558
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:06,403
Can’t I call from airport?

559
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:11,475
Sorry, sir. -Listen, wear sari.1 You’ve to become Vidya.

560
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:14,509
Veer’s wife. Brother Dharam

561
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,217
Sir - Yes.

562
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:16,875
All the Best.

563
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:21,655
Hello, sir. Sir, I didn’t hear.

564
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,832
Door will open automatically.

565
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:42,766
Sorry, brother.

566
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:46,744
Sir Veer, what happened..

567
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:55,949
She’s your maid. -Yes, brother.

568
00:46:57,114 --> 00:47:00,789
You can’t be wrong.
-You’re right.

569
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:03,891
I can recognize Vidya.

570
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:15,309
Vidya. -No..

571
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:17,606
Vidya. -Brother, actauIIy..

572
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:22,614
Relax, I’ll arrange your wife
•before you reach home.

573
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:26,452
Actually I.. -Actually you’re angry with me.

574
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:28,378
You should be.

575
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:31,552
Because I gave priorities to business rather than family.

576
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:33,560
I’m sorry for that.

577
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,131
Why are you apologizing’
It doesn’t look nice.

578
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:38,325
Actually, Vidya.. -It’s ok.

579
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:40,094
Chautala was right.

580
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:43,400
Kapoor family is the best.

581
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,637
Actually I’ve become
a family man.

582
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:48,340
Veer, well done. -Thank
you, brother.

583
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:50,442
Your pocket money will
be 2 Iakh now.

584
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,445
Just double. - Double.

585
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:54,816
Double- Double.

586
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:00,652
What happened?

587
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:06,650
You’ve a big heart. You didn’t
— give it a second thought.

588
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:09,687
I gave it a thought.

589
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:11,425
Anything for a friend.

590
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:24,378
Shower flowers on my mer-maid.

591
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:28,145
Not bad. Impressed without sari.

592
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,275
Brother.

593
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:36,885
Tell me, do you like the
bungalow? And how about Vidya?

594
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:40,884
Bungalow is mine.

595
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:44,594
And why should I talk to you about Vidya?

596
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:49,170
Vidya, get black tea.

597
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:50,561
Sure.

598
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:53,634
Vidya, get black tea.

599
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:57,740
I’m talking to Vidya.

600
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:00,179
I’m talking to Vidya too.

601
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,377
Vidya. -Vidya.

602
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:09,384
Veer, is he cross-eyed?

603
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,325
He can’t see or hear properly.

604
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:18,531
She’s my Vidya.

605
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:22,762
Yes, P rem. She’s my Vidya.

606
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:26,366
She’s our Vidya.

607
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:34,542
Hey! -Leave me!

608
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:37,585
Leave me. -What’s with him’ -Brother, it’s panic attack. 1

609
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:40,553
What panic attack is it?

610
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,214
I think he's mad.

611
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,121
Mr. Dharam, it’s a disease.

612
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:47,321
He moves like wiper of car
• when he gets attack.

613
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:53,629
Brother, I’ll handle him. He has calmed down.

614
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:58,597
You.. -Sir, pIease.

615
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:02,273
I got him.

616
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:06,470
What the hell is wrong with you?

617
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:09,312
Everything is wrong. I made Mary your wife.

618
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:11,750
Exactly, your wife became my wife.

619
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,413
I’m talking about Mary not mywife. ‘

620
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:18,382
Yes, it happened as you wanted.

621
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:20,928
I told Mary on phone..

622
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,595
..to become your wife.

623
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:28,203
Prem, let this charade go on.

624
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:31,268
Brother, thought Janvi was Vidya and doubled my pocket money.

625
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:32,602
Our problems will be solved.

626
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,505
I don't care.

627
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:37,636
I saw how lustlull your brother
was at the airport.

628
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:40,209
Fool! He’ll do something
evil in..

629
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:41,840
..return of double pocket money.

630
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,279
It’s my wife. Janvi..

631
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:48,220
How could you? You made
me hyper wiper.

632
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:50,791
What could I do? He thought
IwasVidya.

633
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:53,553
So you should’ve told
him the truth.

634
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:56,494
I was about to, but he doubIed
Veer’s pocket money.

635
00:50:57,421 --> 00:51:00,231
And he’s Veer. Your friend And he’s Veer’s brother. I

636
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:03,835
Look, don’t get involved! Dharam isn’t a good man.

637
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:07,871
Ok. When you spend Veer’s pocket
• money on your experiments..

638
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:11,476
..u call Veer your brother
and friend.

639
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:14,872
That’s fine, but.. -Look.

640
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:18,809
Veer has always helped us. Now it’s our turn.

641
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:20,548
It’s only for 4 hours.

642
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:23,882
Now take this tea. - No.

643
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:27,258
And behave nicely with him. Ok.

644
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:29,721
Remember. We’re doing
this for Veer.

645
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:33,561
Go now. - Now.

646
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:40,340
• Sir, sorry I couldn’t hear you on the phone. What did you say?

647
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:44,173
Iwas saying to slit yourj throat with the knife.1

648
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:46,443
Prem, go.

649
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:48,447
Why me?

650
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,744
Veer, tell me.. -Yes.

651
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:52,752
Why does Chopru live with you?

652
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:55,949
Brother, he has problem
of panic attack.

653
00:51:57,147 --> 00:51:58,854
Doctor, told him to change
his surrounding.

654
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:00,894
So he shifted her for few days.

655
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:08,767
Listen, it’s dangerous to keep a lunatic at home.

656
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:10,270
Brother! - Brother!.

657
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:12,262
Black Tea.

658
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:21,375
Veer, who is she?

659
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:26,554
She.. she’s a girl.

660
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:30,625
I know that.But who is she?

661
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:32,458
What do you mean?

662
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:37,287
I mean, I’m Dharam, you’re
Veer and he’s mad.

663
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:38,790
Who is she?

664
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,130
I.. tell him she’s girlfriend.

665
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:47,239
His.

666
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:48,441
Mine.

667
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:52,170
Why is your girlfriend’s
•snap in this house?•

668
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:53,942
Can’t you control your girl friend?

669
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:55,915
I did.

670
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:59,610
But you messed everything.
-Really?

671
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:04,884
It’s surprising that even you
• can have a girl friend.

672
00:53:06,149 --> 00:53:07,321
Why? Why not?

673
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:08,760
It’s possible.

674
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:11,394
Anyone can be mistaken.

675
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:15,499
Look, you’re insuIting
my girl friend.

676
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,105
Insult?

677
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:23,301
She was insulted when she
•became your girl friend.

678
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:27,678
Brother, leave it. Leave it.

679
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:29,910
Yes, leave it.

680
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:32,817
His girlfriend’s snap can
be in this house..

681
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,821
..but not Vidya’s.

682
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,658
It'll be somewhere around.

683
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:41,923
I’ve. Look, brother.

684
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:49,561
Veer, why is Vidya’s photo in his wallet?

685
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:53,832
Prem, how is Vidya’s photo
in your wallet?

686
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,735
Veer, how is Vidya’s photo in my wallet?

687
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:01,474
Dharam, this is Veer’s waIIet.

688

He send Prem to buy bread.
— He took the wallet. -Yes.

689

00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:07,687
Yes.

691
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:12,351
You’ve no money even to buy bread. Disgusting.

692
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:17,392
Mr. Dharam, my time will also come. —

693
00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:25,470
Do you see this. This
•is Rolex. Original.

694
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,769
You can’t get such time.

695

700
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:52,632
Veer. - Veer.

701
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,195
How did you like the room?

702
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,202
Room? This is a bungalow.

00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:04,144
Listen, hurry up. My
•wife is pregnant.

704
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:06,811

00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:14,249
Ok. Should I get the

707
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:16,588

709
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:23,293
Vagawl.

710
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:39,707
What are you doing?

711
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:45,650
This is my house. I can do anything. Who are you?•

712

00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:17,243
Oh no! Don’t hit me. -What
happened, brother?

716
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:20,548
An idiot was putting his nameplate here.

717
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:25,616
Where did he go, brother? -Up.

718
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:27,253
You killed him.

719
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:30,422
No, he’s up there.

720
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,396
Prem.

721
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:33,394
You know him. - No.

722
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:35,492
It’s formal hi, hello. Hi. -Hi.

723
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:37,401
Hello. -What are you
•doing, upstairs?

724
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,701
This man hit me. - You!

725
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:43,266
Mr. Dharam, you’re rich so you’ll exploit poor.

726
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:44,505
This isn't fair.

727
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:46,638
No. Hey, you. -What?

728
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:49,640
Get down fool. - Don't hit me.

729
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,685
• I’ll explain it to • you. Come with me.

730
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:52,981
Please come.

731
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,188
Who is he?

732
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:58,782
Brother, Raghu is actually
mad. -What?

733
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:01,556
Yes, Raghu. Brother]
— Dharam is mad.

734
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:05,355
So we put extra sugar
in tea. -Why?

735
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:07,128
To digest bitter truth.

736
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:08,832
But how did it happen?

737
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:12,134
Once Raghu owned 6 bungalow
in this area.

738
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:15,333
He got addicted to betting
in cricket match.

739
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,207
Tell me.Listen.

740
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:21,214
You know the match of Yuvraj.
-Yes, 6 sixes on 6 baIls.

741
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:25,611
Brother had bet that he can’t hit six. -ReaIIy?

742
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:27,546
Then. Then What?

743
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:30,656
Every ball was out of boundary.

744
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:35,161
And Raghu lost all hisi bungalows in gambling.

745
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,489
And then over eneded there.

746
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:39,457
..n his madness started.

747
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,497
Now he thinks every bungalow
is his lost bungalow.

748
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:46,468
He chants bungalow all day.

749
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:48,605
I don’t know what he says.

750
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:53,643
It means this mad man is here, there, everywhere.

751
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:56,275
Brother, it’s dangerous.

752
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:57,476
It’s dangerous.

753
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:02,956
But doctor say that if he stays
*near this bungalow he might get cured.

754
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:06,285
Not all all. He should be sent to asylum.

755
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:08,555
That’s why we’re shifting
brother to Losoto.

756
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:09,722
Flight is in 4 hours.

757
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:14,329
But I came with the luggage in tempo.1

758
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:16,932
So shift. Rental with

759

00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:25,506
Come. -We’ll catch up Iater.

761
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:30,475
Dhondu, God has made such
a big man crazy.

762
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:32,884
Let’s go.;0]

763
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,940
Where is the packing?

764
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,636
Where? - Don't shout.

765
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,970
Don't shoo me.- Where is the..

766
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:00,873

You got tempo. -Who are they?

768
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:06,954
They’re my friends.

769
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:10,156
Why did they come in tempo?

770
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:13,652
To get your luggage to airport.

771
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:15,919
One tempo for 2 bags.

772
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,798
So you needed 2 tempos.

773
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:24,797
Actually all these things will also go with your luggage.

774
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,532
Veer won’t let you go empty handed.

775
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:29,643
Whose idea was it of gifts?

776
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:34,804
Of Prem. - I knew it.

777
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:37,817
Veer. - Yes?

778
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:40,278
If you want to give me something..

779
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:43,188
..give me Vidya.

780
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:45,959
I’ll take Vidya along.

781
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:49,595
Will you come with me, Vidya?

782
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:51,256

783
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:53,826

You too go. -Prem. Prem.

01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:18,715
Prem, let’s go. Prem move.

793
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:30,796
What happened to him.

794
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:34,471
Another panic attack.
I’ll see him.

795
01:00:34,864 --> 01:00:35,968
You wait here.

796
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:38,674
Not even in a mall...

797
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:40,476
..so many people don’t come
as in your bungalow.

798
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:43,642
We will take him out
for shopping.

799
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,319
We’ll take his luggage also and leave him to airport directly.

800
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:49,617
But who will convinc
him to go out?

801
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:51,750
I’ll talk to him.-Wait. Not you.

802
01:00:53,516 --> 01:00:54,688
I'll do this.

803
01:01:07,897 --> 01:01:09,274
I hope Veer isn’t irritating you?

804
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:13,012
If yes then this is my personal
number, call me.

805
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,371
There is no need of that.

806
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,542
Veer is a good husband.-You
look forward.

807
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:19,850
Why? I’m not driving.

808
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:22,180
Then why are you looking back?
-I’m keeping an eye.

809
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:24,654
On what? -Cars coming
from behind.

810
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:25,957
someone shouldn't knock us.

811
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,255
There is rear view mirror.

Sit properly. Don’t

Why? Who will take care of him?

815
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:39,531
Mr. Dharam, actually Prem
• is so attached to you..

816
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,565
..that he’s taking care of you.

That’s why he’s Iooking
•at you. -Oh my God!

Who is Dindayal? Your
security man?

820
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,351
No. My doberman.

Don’t you feel odd.

832
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:42,232
Odd. Why, brother?

833
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:46,438
Vidya’s phone on Prem’s
cell. Isn’t it odd?

834
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:50,101
Brother, we’re getting calls
on phone. I mean..

835
01:02:50,366 --> 01:02:52,277

This is Veer’s phone.

840
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:11,126
They’re identical sets.
— It was by mistake.

841
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:12,731
This is mine.

842
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:18,128
In Losoto military coup is announced.

843

Hey, you don’t know me.

925
01:07:15,965 --> 01:07:19,105
People die when I breathe.

926
01:07:19,668 --> 01:07:22,114
Then chose a good mouth fresher.

927
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,374
You’re mocking me.

She starts anytime. Let me
— say action first, silly.

1012
01:13:21,128 --> 01:13:22,869
But I don’t think she was acting.

1013
01:13:24,731 --> 01:13:27,371
But acting has to be original.

1014
01:13:27,634 --> 01:13:29,636
I mean she’s so talented.
-Thank God.

1015

Veer, kiss was in the script.

1033
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:34,806
And you kissed her.

1034
01:14:35,369 --> 01:14:36,609
No love, no emotions.

1035
01:14:37,237 --> 01:14:38,409
There should be a build up.

1036
01:14:39,539 --> 01:14:41,678
Brother, I didn’t get it.

1037
01:14:42,275 --> 01:14:43,549

..how it feels when someone else uses your credit card?

1057
01:15:33,126 --> 01:15:34,537
Tell me what’s going on.

1058
01:15:34,594 --> 01:15:36,471
Dharam came suddenly
and thought I was..

1059
01:15:36,530 --> 01:15:38,100
..Vidya and doubled the pocket money.

1060

Please go. -Don’t worry.

1064

It's 2.

1065
01:15:47,541 --> 01:15:49,578
And Venus is vertical. Ther
won’t be any problem.

1066

Brother left for Losoto.

1071
01:16:09,863 --> 01:16:11,171
How could he?

1072
01:16:11,598 --> 01:16:13,509
Without any prior notice.

He’s psychiatrist.

1084
01:16:42,395 --> 01:16:43,601
He doesnot seem to be.

1085
01:16:43,864 --> 01:16:45,241
Should I get the luggage?

1086
01:16:45,265 --> 01:16:47,836
Dhondu. -Just chill. -Flight

She’s Vidya. -Yes.

1101
01:17:16,730 --> 01:17:19,438
A mad man thinks everyone

01:17:41,288 --> 01:17:43,097
This pant isn’t pant.

1113
01:17:43,156 --> 01:17:44,726
He’s not Ajay Devgan. -Quiet.

I’ll spread light where there is darkness.

01:25:12,438 --> 01:25:16,181

I’ll fly cars in air.

1242
01:25:50,543 --> 01:25:54,116
I’ll change days of month.

01:25:54,447 --> 01:25:57,553
I’ll change months of years.

Yes.-Yes.

1256
01:26:54,107 --> 01:26:56,314
Chris, your band got whacked.

1257
01:26:56,375 --> 01:26:58,582
Betty, I warn you.

01:26:59,212 --> 01:27:00,452
Just cut the crap.

01:27:02,248 --> 01:27:03,556
You’ll raise hand on girl.

Talk to me.

1262
01:27:04,851 --> 01:27:06,455
SD.-Kid.

1263
01:27:07,353 --> 01:27:08,627
Your hand is broken.

1264
01:27:08,821 --> 01:27:10,357
Chris. -Want to get your leg broken?

1265
01:27:11,224 --> 01:27:12,567
Don’t cross your Iimit.

1266
01:27:12,625 --> 01:27:15,299
Tell me my Iimit.

1267
01:27:15,928 --> 01:27:17,532
Tell me. -Hey.

1268
01:27:20,233 --> 01:27:23,806
I’m Prem. Prem Chopra.

1269
01:27:24,804 --> 01:27:27,182
What are you doing? Threatening
or giving your bio-data.

1270
01:27:29,876 --> 01:27:31,321
Janvi, take him home.

1271
01:27:31,577 --> 01:27:33,250
Go. - Chriss.

1272
01:27:33,513 --> 01:27:35,254
Guys, chill.

We’re creative people
Stop fighting.

1274
01:27:39,685 --> 01:27:41,187
Control yourself. Come on.

1275
01:27:44,323 --> 01:27:45,563
Veer.

1276
01:27:45,892 --> 01:27:49,669
Change your name to ‘coward’.

1277
01:27:50,396 --> 01:27:52,467
What are you staring?
— Go home. -Come.

1278
01:27:52,532 --> 01:27:53,943
Play with toys.

1279
01:27:54,433 --> 01:27:56,606
Prem, what happened?

1280
01:27:57,336 --> 01:27:58,781
The way your car blew up..

01:27:59,372 --> 01:28:00,874
..u too got scared..
— -Come, Prem.

1282
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:02,446
Come.

1283
01:28:02,742 --> 01:28:05,586
And you know who is the biggest coward?

1284
01:28:06,145 --> 01:28:09,718
This - Veer's NRI brother.

1285
01:28:12,718 --> 01:28:15,221
Non-reacting Indian.

1286
01:28:51,557 --> 01:28:52,695
Do you’ve a family?

1287
01:28:54,627 --> 01:28:56,834
Why? -Who will take
— you to hospital? —

1288
01:29:01,234 --> 01:29:04,272
What? Making jokes, uncIe’?

1289
01:29:04,503 --> 01:29:06,540
I just got started joking.

1290
01:29:06,906 --> 01:29:08,544
I’m doing fighting for 30 years.

1291
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:22,583
Hit him.

1292
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:15,867
Oh no!- Dad is outside.

1293
01:32:17,196 --> 01:32:18,698
Bye, Janvi. -Ok, bye.

1294
01:32:18,764 --> 01:32:21,938
Wait, idiots. Don’t you’ve manners or etiquettes.

1295
01:32:23,302 --> 01:32:24,940
Janvi, I’ll drop you home. Veer, get out.

1296
01:32:25,738 --> 01:32:28,378
Dad, thank God you’re safe.

1297
01:32:28,808 --> 01:32:31,345
Inspector Walia phoned
and told..

1298
01:32:31,410 --> 01:32:32,684
..there was fig hting
• at your place.

1299
01:32:32,745 --> 01:32:34,656
Yes, but he was there.

1300
01:32:35,247 --> 01:32:36,658
He thrashed them.

1301
01:32:36,715 --> 01:32:39,719
They’ll be in hospital
for a month.

1302
01:32:39,785 --> 01:32:41,822
And the
— toMr.
credit goes Dharam.

1303
01:32:42,455 --> 01:32:43,866
Veer's elder brother.

1304
01:32:44,089 --> 01:32:46,535
The famous Mr. Dharam Kapur.

1305
01:32:46,725 --> 01:32:48,102
Thank you, sir.

1306
01:32:48,294 --> 01:32:50,331
You brought my daughter
safely home.

1307
01:32:50,529 --> 01:32:53,339
I’m pleased to see you.

1308
01:32:53,732 --> 01:32:55,405
Why?

1309
01:32:55,468 --> 01:32:58,142
No, I was giving an example.

1310
01:32:58,337 --> 01:33:00,248
An example. A proverb.

1311
01:33:00,706 --> 01:33:02,743
You know, dad, he dances very well.

1312
01:33:02,808 --> 01:33:05,789
He plays drum very weII. Mind-blowing. Superb.

1313
01:33:05,845 --> 01:33:07,381
Anyway, I’ll go and change.

1314
01:33:07,646 --> 01:33:09,148
Bye. -Bye.;0]

1315
01:33:09,448 --> 01:33:11,792
Ok, sir. Thank you very much. -Wait.

1316
01:33:15,387 --> 01:33:16,695
ldon’t know if I should say this.

1317
01:33:17,189 --> 01:33:19,760
But your daughter is
• going to marry.. —

1318
01:33:20,459 --> 01:33:22,234
..a boy who isn’t worthy of becoming your son-in-law.

1319
01:33:22,828 --> 01:33:24,239
You’re saying this.

1320
01:33:25,197 --> 01:33:26,505
What’s going on?

1321
01:33:26,565 --> 01:33:28,772
You’re getting criticized
because of him.

1322
01:33:30,436 --> 01:33:32,279
But my daughter says..

1323
01:33:32,338 --> 01:33:34,375
..he’s decent, upright..

1324
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:35,578
..and down to earth.

1325
01:33:35,641 --> 01:33:36,915
You’re right. Down to earth.

1326
01:33:37,576 --> 01:33:39,317
He’s very IowIy.

1327
01:33:40,613 --> 01:33:42,559
Your daughte
— (love)

1328
01:33:43,415 --> 01:33:45,486
My daughter’s Prem (love)
isn’t right.

1329
01:33:46,352 --> 01:33:49,231
But what to do? - love is blind.

1330
01:33:50,189 --> 01:33:52,829
Actually, because of you..

1331
01:33:53,459 --> 01:33:55,336
..connection to Kapur’s famiIy..

1332
01:33:55,394 --> 01:33:56,702
..I thought..

1333
01:33:57,663 --> 01:33:59,506
I don’t blame you. Listen.

1334
01:34:00,266 --> 01:34:03,440
If you put horse’s shoe on donkey..

1335
01:34:03,869 --> 01:34:05,405
..don key won’t become horse.

1336
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:07,913
If I could’ve my way..

1337
01:34:08,374 --> 01:34:10,445
..I’d drive him out of my house.

1338
01:34:11,577 --> 01:34:13,181
He’s not my own.

1339
01:34:13,512 --> 01:34:15,287
Step-brother. -What? -No.

1340
01:34:15,347 --> 01:34:16,348
Straight-forward .

1341
01:34:16,415 --> 01:34:18,895
I’ve seen straight-forward
man like you.

1342
01:34:18,951 --> 01:34:21,158
We don’t see such kind hearted man.

1343
01:34:21,887 --> 01:34:24,766
By the way, are you married. -Bachelor.

1344
01:34:25,357 --> 01:34:27,098
Oh! Muscular.

1345
01:34:27,459 --> 01:34:28,904
Popular. Spectacular.

1346
01:34:29,128 --> 01:34:32,166
And bachelor. -And I can also dance.

1347
01:34:33,866 --> 01:34:36,210
Why are they hugging?

1348
01:34:36,735 --> 01:34:38,373
Marriage is fixed. Congrats.

1349
01:34:38,871 --> 01:34:40,316
What are you saying?

1350
01:34:40,573 --> 01:34:42,712
Vidya will surely be
daughter-in-law of Kapur family.

1351
01:34:43,175 --> 01:34:44,711
What are you saying?

1352
01:34:44,777 --> 01:34:46,654
But wife of elder brother.

1353
01:34:47,746 --> 01:34:49,589
What are you saying?

1354
01:34:55,588 --> 01:34:57,192
Good night, Veer. -Good
night, brother.

1355
01:34:59,692 --> 01:35:01,763
Good night, Vidya. -Good
night, brother.

1356
01:35:02,161 --> 01:35:04,402
Leave me. -Good night.

1357
01:35:05,731 --> 01:35:08,337
Hey! Why are you going there?

1358
01:35:10,369 --> 01:35:11,814
I’m scared to sleep alone.

1359
01:35:12,571 --> 01:35:14,517
Sleep with me. Come. -No.

1360
01:35:14,773 --> 01:35:16,252
I'm not so scared.

1361
01:35:16,875 --> 01:35:18,513
Good night. -Good night.

1362
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:22,516
Good night. -Good night.

1363
01:35:23,215 --> 01:35:25,422
Come. When will this problem be solved?

1364
01:35:26,452 --> 01:35:29,126
God, when will my brother
go to Losoto.

1365
01:35:30,356 --> 01:35:31,835
Veer, Iwas thinking
• of something.

1366
01:35:32,257 --> 01:35:33,895
We've lied now.

1367
01:35:34,126 --> 01:35:35,867
But when you’ll marry Vidya..

1368
01:35:35,928 --> 01:35:37,635
..Mr. Dharam wiII find the truth.

1369
01:35:38,831 --> 01:35:40,276
Why are you scaring me, Janvi.

1370
01:35:40,633 --> 01:35:41,839
We'll think about it later.

1371
01:35:42,701 --> 01:35:44,112
Good night.

1372
01:35:56,482 --> 01:35:58,826
What are you doing? -Exercise
early morning..

1373
01:35:59,218 --> 01:36:01,357
..is good for healt -
-It’s late night.

1374
01:36:01,654 --> 01:36:03,133
There’s time to morning.

1375
01:36:04,156 --> 01:36:05,499
Late night.

1376
01:36:05,924 --> 01:36:07,301
What's the time?

1377
01:36:08,661 --> 01:36:10,607
You don’t have a watch.
Good night.

1378
01:36:21,206 --> 01:36:23,277
Coming. -No.

1379
01:36:32,317 --> 01:36:34,820
Vidya. -Prem, dad is admitted
in hospital. -What?

1380
01:36:44,129 --> 01:36:46,609
It’s you. -Prem, there is a problem. -What?

1381
01:36:47,433 --> 01:36:48,878
Vidya phoned. Her dad
is in hospital.

1382
01:36:49,301 --> 01:36:50,439
He got heart attack.

1383
01:36:51,136 --> 01:36:52,444
It had to happen. -What?

1384
01:36:52,504 --> 01:36:54,506
Your brother must’ve said
something worse.

1385
01:36:54,773 --> 01:36:55,843
Forget that. What should I do now?.

1386
01:36:55,908 --> 01:36:57,251
Go to hospital.

1387
01:36:57,910 --> 01:37:00,356
Veer, where are you going?

1388
01:37:01,213 --> 01:37:02,521
So late in the night.

1389
01:37:03,916 --> 01:37:06,556
Vi. Janvi’s father
•is in hospital.

1390
01:37:07,753 --> 01:37:09,426
Really? -Yes.

1391
01:37:09,488 --> 01:37:12,298
So he should go. Why
are you going?

1392
01:37:13,158 --> 01:37:16,401
Brother, if I go and Janvi’s
father sees me..

1393
01:37:16,795 --> 01:37:18,797
..his heart attack will become heart fail.

1394
01:37:19,465 --> 01:37:20,705
Correct.

1395
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:23,837
You’ve said something right
— for the first time in life.

1396
01:37:24,203 --> 01:37:26,149
Veer, you go. All the
best. Ok? -Ok.

1397
01:37:26,338 --> 01:37:27,612
I’ll phone you.

1398
01:37:37,149 --> 01:37:38,890
Come.- Come.- No.

1399
01:37:47,826 --> 01:37:50,306
Meena, I’m not a rogue.

1400
01:37:51,263 --> 01:37:53,300
What? You’re in hospital.

1401
01:37:54,199 --> 01:37:55,644
Have patience, Meena.

1402
01:37:56,201 --> 01:37:59,273
Let me deliver the goods before
you deliver the baby.

1403
01:37:59,705 --> 01:38:01,685
Have patience. I’m coming.

1404
01:38:01,940 --> 01:38:03,817
I’m coming, dear.

1405
01:38:04,143 --> 01:38:06,714
Coming. -Dhondu. -What?

1406
01:38:07,179 --> 01:38:09,557
Tell your half-better? -What?

1407
01:38:09,615 --> 01:38:11,856
Just chill, Meena.

1408
01:38:11,917 --> 01:38:14,329
Yes. -Shut up, fool.

I thought he was with you.
-He’s not with me.

1458
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:50,911
If not with you, where is Prem?

Brother. -Bloody rapist.

1467
01:42:07,586 --> 01:42:09,327
Mr. Dharam, he’s not a rapist.

He.. he has disease of sleep walking.

Brother, listen to me.

1479

You’re saying to drive. But

Look, even daughter belongs
to someone else.

She has to go one day.

1557

..but we’re moving towards death.

1576

1583
01:48:04,376 --> 01:48:06,356
Please Veer.

1584
01:48:06,778 --> 01:48:09,349
Let me talk. - Tobu come.

1585
01:48:11,216 --> 01:48:13,423
We’ve no money, but..

1586
01:48:14,386 --> 01:48:16,332
..we’ve something to make
you our debtors.

1587
01:48:18,456 --> 01:48:20,458
Expect the unexpected.

1588
01:48:22,293 --> 01:48:23,431
Move.

1589
01:48:24,462 --> 01:48:26,669
This is royal gift for
— king of Losoto.

1590
01:48:27,332 --> 01:48:28,470
Prem.

1591
01:48:28,933 --> 01:48:30,378
You stole king’s gift.

1592
01:48:30,435 --> 01:48:32,847
What will brother say? -Veer.

1593
01:48:33,872 --> 01:48:35,647
You want to see this gift
• in king’s treasure..

1594
01:48:36,408 --> 01:48:38,183
on our Iders

1595
01:48:39,844 --> 01:48:41,152
Head.

1596
01:48:51,956 --> 01:48:54,459
Diamonds, gems.

1597
01:48:54,526 --> 01:48:56,938
Pearl harbour. Black Diamond.

1598
01:48:57,395 --> 01:49:00,968
Treasure. Everything.

1599
01:49:06,604 --> 01:49:08,641
Brother Prem says so you
don’t need to ask.

1600
01:49:08,807 --> 01:49:10,616
Everything is in it. Open it.

1601
01:49:29,527 --> 01:49:30,835
It’s lemon pickle.

1602
01:49:34,165 --> 01:49:35,701
It’s not pickIe.

1603
01:49:35,900 --> 01:49:37,345
Does anyone give pickle
asgiftto king?

1604
01:49:37,402 --> 01:49:39,404
It must’ve hidden diamonds
to evade customs.

1605
01:49:39,637 --> 01:49:41,742
He’s right. This belongs
to my brother.

1606
01:49:53,418 --> 01:49:54,658
This isn’t lemon pickle.

1607
01:49:55,253 --> 01:49:56,323
I said so.

1608
01:49:56,754 --> 01:49:57,892
It has carrot and raddish too.

1609
01:50:03,228 --> 01:50:04,798
Tabu says pickle is nice.

1610
01:50:04,929 --> 01:50:06,806
It would’ve been better if you’d brought bread too.

1611
01:50:06,965 --> 01:50:09,502
Not bread. We’ll chop you.

1612
01:50:13,671 --> 01:50:14,911
Tobu says..

1613
01:50:15,573 --> 01:50:18,782
..if you don’t give money
within 2 days..

1614
01:50:18,843 --> 01:50:21,722
..we’ll seize your bungalow
worth millions.

1615
01:50:21,980 --> 01:50:24,483
And for fooling us with pickle..

1616
01:50:24,749 --> 01:50:27,423
..we’II punish you now.

1617
01:50:28,553 --> 01:50:29,759
Tobu is very wicked.

1618
01:50:30,588 --> 01:50:31,828
He took our clothes too.

1619
01:50:33,258 --> 01:50:35,295
It’s because of your foolishness. -What?

1620
01:50:35,693 --> 01:50:36,763
Mine? - Yes.

1621
01:50:36,828 --> 01:50:39,536
He bought cheap shirts
and trousers.

1622
01:50:39,864 --> 01:50:41,002
Wefooled him of million
of rupees.

1623
01:50:41,232 --> 01:50:42,370
What are you doing here?

1624
01:50:42,834 --> 01:50:44,245
Sorry. -Run away.

1625
01:50:46,704 --> 01:50:48,809
It’s not about money, but your judgement.

1626
01:50:49,908 --> 01:50:51,387
Because of your creative ideas..

1627
01:50:51,676 --> 01:50:53,952
..there are more problems
in my life.

1628
01:50:54,412 --> 01:50:55,823
Was your dad photographer. -Why?

1629
01:50:57,315 --> 01:50:58,760
You always think so negative.

1630
01:50:59,317 --> 01:51:00,557
Don't be tense. - I'm here.

1631
01:51:00,752 --> 01:51:02,254
I’ve many creative ideas.

1632
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:03,731
I don't care.

1633
01:51:05,757 --> 01:51:07,361
Why are you barking?

1634
01:51:07,625 --> 01:51:08,695
Dharam is there.

1635
01:51:08,927 --> 01:51:10,702
..who isn’t going to Losoto.

1636
01:51:11,229 --> 01:51:13,573
Tobu has exposed our shorts.

1637
01:51:13,965 --> 01:51:15,273
And now you’re barking.

1638
01:51:15,667 --> 01:51:17,840
Dog, you’re barking from
inside the car..

1639
01:51:17,902 --> 01:51:20,883
..I’II come in and whack you.

1640
01:51:27,178 --> 01:51:28,657
Run, Veer.

1641
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:30,655
You run. - You have teased him.

1642
01:51:38,556 --> 01:51:40,229
Can you believe it, Mrs. Lobo?

1643
01:51:40,692 --> 01:51:43,434
These days a person known
as Rapist Ranga..

1644
01:51:43,695 --> 01:51:46,904
..is raping beautiful girl becoming half naked.

1645
01:51:47,332 --> 01:51:48,868
Beautiful girls. -Yes.

1646
01:51:48,933 --> 01:51:51,641
Then we must take care.
-Yes. -Show me.

1647
01:51:51,936 --> 01:51:53,210
Yes.

1648
01:51:57,408 --> 01:51:59,319
Ranga. -Half naked.

1649
01:51:59,377 --> 01:52:01,357
Run. -HeIp.

1650
01:52:05,950 --> 01:52:07,361
Save Us.

1651
01:52:15,927 --> 01:52:18,203
Help me. -Someone help us.

1652
01:52:19,864 --> 01:52:23,311
Rapist. -Help us.

1653
01:52:32,644 --> 01:52:33,748
Hello, sir. -Please.

1654
01:52:35,980 --> 01:52:38,688
Mary, you’re a girI.

1655
01:52:39,550 --> 01:52:41,325
Like a family member.
-Thank you, sir.

1656
01:52:41,486 --> 01:52:42,624
That’s why I say..

1657
01:52:43,421 --> 01:52:45,458
..from today you’ll sleep
in my bedroom..

1658
01:52:45,523 --> 01:52:46,763
..and I’ll be in your .bedroom. -We..

1659
01:52:48,192 --> 01:52:49,865
He’s saying..

1660
01:52:51,262 --> 01:52:52,400
I’d to say it.

1661
01:52:53,264 --> 01:52:55,244
Because ‘Prem’(Iove) is between us.

1662
01:52:55,833 --> 01:52:58,245
What? - Love between us.

1663
01:52:58,836 --> 01:53:00,543
Sir, I’m a servant.

1664
01:53:00,772 --> 01:53:02,615
Prem. - Prem.

1665
01:53:03,775 --> 01:53:05,186
..doesn’t differentiate between rich and poor.

1666
01:53:05,777 --> 01:53:07,017
He can befall on anyone.

1667
01:53:08,980 --> 01:53:12,621
So now you’ll be in my bedroom.

1668
01:53:12,884 --> 01:53:14,488
Is that clear? - Yes.

1669
01:53:24,028 --> 01:53:25,302
Hello, Veer.

1670
01:53:25,730 --> 01:53:28,472
Now Mary will give you your pocket money.

1671
01:53:28,733 --> 01:53:29,973
What? Our Mary.

1672
01:53:30,535 --> 01:53:32,173
Now she’s not our Mary.

1673
01:53:32,470 --> 01:53:33,847
She's madam from maid.

1674
01:53:34,505 --> 01:53:37,816
Your brother will be with Mary tonight.

1675
01:53:38,009 --> 01:53:40,250
I’ve no time to Iisten
•to your rubbish!

1676
01:53:40,778 --> 01:53:41,984
I’m going to change.

1677
01:53:43,514 --> 01:53:44,652
He's shocked.

1678
01:53:44,882 --> 01:53:46,953
He doesn’t know he’s not
wearing anything.

1679
01:53:48,252 --> 01:53:49,322
What will he change?

1680
01:53:49,787 --> 01:53:52,461
Prem, saw the result of your third class idea.

1681
01:53:52,857 --> 01:53:54,837
You’re roaming in city half naked.

1682
01:53:55,526 --> 01:53:56,698
And you started stealing too.

1683
01:53:56,961 --> 01:53:58,201
First Mr. Dharam's watch.

1684
01:53:58,463 --> 01:54:00,340
Then king’s royal gift.

1685
01:54:00,698 --> 01:54:02,439
Not royal, it had pickle.

1686
01:54:02,834 --> 01:54:03,938
You don’t have to yell at me.

1687
01:54:04,368 --> 01:54:07,042
You said that we should
do this for Veer.

1688
01:54:07,271 --> 01:54:08,375
And..

1689
01:54:09,774 --> 01:54:11,583
Janvi- It's same.

1690
01:54:16,547 --> 01:54:17,924
Prem, stop.

1691
01:54:18,349 --> 01:54:20,056
Veer.

1692
01:54:20,551 --> 01:54:21,586
What happened?

1693
01:54:22,253 --> 01:54:23,288
What happened?

1694
01:54:23,621 --> 01:54:25,601
Prem fled with Vidya.

1695
01:54:25,823 --> 01:54:26,927
Get the car.

1696
01:54:27,458 --> 01:54:28,664
He took the car.

1697
01:54:31,829 --> 01:54:32,864
Come.

1698
01:54:33,464 --> 01:54:35,307
What are you doing?

1699
01:54:44,575 --> 01:54:45,645
Dhondu.

1700
01:54:48,946 --> 01:54:50,391
What is this?

1701
01:54:55,486 --> 01:54:56,988
Prem, tell him.

1702
01:55:12,303 --> 01:55:14,305
He broke it.

1703
01:55:20,478 --> 01:55:22,287
Drive properIy.

1704
01:55:22,346 --> 01:55:23,620
Drive sIowIy.

1705
01:55:28,419 --> 01:55:30,160
Dhondu, stop.

1706
01:55:31,255 --> 01:55:32,359
Dhondu.

1707
01:55:35,259 --> 01:55:37,205
Dhondu, stop.

1708
01:55:42,900 --> 01:55:45,312
Dhondu, chair.

1709
01:55:46,671 --> 01:55:48,708
Shut up. -I didn’tsayaword.

1710
01:55:50,474 --> 01:55:51,680
Dhondu.

1711
01:55:55,813 --> 01:55:58,020
Raghu, chill.

1712
01:55:58,616 --> 01:56:01,222
Dhondu.

1713
01:56:12,296 --> 01:56:16,767
I’m ruined. My Meena
•is in this hospital. •

1714
01:56:16,834 --> 01:56:17,812
Meena.

1715
01:56:27,178 --> 01:56:28,623
What happened to Janvi?
-I don’t know.

1716
01:56:29,013 --> 01:56:30,993
He famed while talking. -Prem.

1717
01:56:40,825 --> 01:56:42,395
Prem, this time you’ve
gone too far.

1718
01:56:42,927 --> 01:56:44,235
Actually, brother..

1719
01:56:44,428 --> 01:56:45,907
.Vidya got seriousIy
ill suddenly.

1720
01:56:46,397 --> 01:56:47,671
So prem.

1721
01:56:47,732 --> 01:56:49,609
Vidya was ill so..

1722
01:56:49,667 --> 01:56:50,873
..he should have told us.

1723
01:56:51,535 --> 01:56:52,707
How dare you touch her!

1724
01:56:53,004 --> 01:56:54,745
Congrats, she’s pregnant.

1725
01:57:29,473 --> 01:57:32,750
Why is it so peaceful here?

1726
01:57:34,679 --> 01:57:39,560
Why am I dumb-struck?

1727
01:57:40,985 --> 01:57:43,261
What has happened..

1728
01:57:44,021 --> 01:57:46,262
..even the season is new.

1729
01:57:46,657 --> 01:57:51,504
The earth and sky is
filled with joy.

1730
01:58:05,509 --> 01:58:08,956
Why is it so peaceful here?

1731
01:58:10,681 --> 01:58:15,255
Why am I dumb-struck?

1732
01:58:17,021 --> 01:58:19,433
What has happened..

1733
01:58:20,057 --> 01:58:22,401

..joy will come with tears.

1741
01:59:29,593 --> 01:59:33,871
What are these moments.

1742
01:59:34,632 --> 01:59:39,741
..where we are afar even
though together?

1743
01:59:41,572 --> 01:59:44,746
WhyamIsoIoneIy?

1744
01:59:46,811 --> 01:59:51,351
Why do the world seem lonely?

1745
01:59:53,250 --> 01:59:55,491
Everything it upside down.

1746
01:59:56,287 --> 01:59:58,426
What's the matter?

1747
01:59:58,823 --> 02:00:03,670
Life is cross with me.

1748

..not sending friends with price tag.

1754
02:01:02,553 --> 02:01:04,396
Or I wouldn’t have been able
to afford you, friend.

1755
02:01:05,422 --> 02:01:06,628
You’re very priceless.

1756
02:01:09,026 --> 02:01:10,664
Now you’re talking sense.

1757
02:01:15,432 --> 02:01:16,638
I’m sorry.

1758
02:01:18,736 --> 02:01:20,716
For what?-You know

1759
02:01:22,606 --> 02:01:25,018
I’ve decided to tell brother the truth.

1760
02:01:25,576 --> 02:01:26,816
What are you saying, Veer?

1761
02:01:27,278 --> 02:01:28,586
I’m right, Janvi.

1762
02:01:28,646 --> 02:01:31,786
I mean, is it worth it? My friend, my sister-in-law..

1763
02:01:32,650 --> 02:01:34,596
..can’t enjoy important
joy of life.

1764
02:01:35,252 --> 02:01:36,560
I don’t care for such money.

1765
02:01:37,421 --> 02:01:38,957
You did so much for us.

1766
02:01:39,023 --> 02:01:41,469
This time.. -But this lie is proving costly now.

1767
02:01:42,359 --> 02:01:43,599
And what you’re doing is..

1768
02:01:43,827 --> 02:01:45,864
..can’t be repaid by me.

1769
02:01:46,931 --> 02:01:51,641
Favor. Repay. Such words
shouldn’t come between friendsi

1770
02:01:52,303 --> 02:01:53,407
That’s right, Prem.

1771
02:01:53,637 --> 02:01:55,378
We think of other’s benefit
in friendship.

1772
02:01:55,606 --> 02:01:57,813
Not taken advantage of. -Veer.

1773
02:02:05,416 --> 02:02:07,020
It’s all over. I’m going.

1774
02:02:07,618 --> 02:02:10,030
Mr. Dharam, you found out. -Yes.

1775
02:02:11,555 --> 02:02:13,000
Chautala, told me everything. -Yes.

1776
02:02:13,924 --> 02:02:16,803
Veer was going to tell you what Chautala told you.

1777
02:02:18,262 --> 02:02:20,037
Yes, brother. Forgive me.

1778
02:02:20,598 --> 02:02:22,407
I'd erred!- Err?

1779
02:02:23,667 --> 02:02:25,613
My flight to Losoto is resumed..

1780
02:02:25,836 --> 02:02:26,871
..so what’s your fault?

1781
02:02:29,206 --> 02:02:30,879
It’s his fault, brother.

1782
02:02:31,542 --> 02:02:33,351
He knew your flight is resumed.

1783
02:02:33,510 --> 02:02:35,285
But he wanted you to stay
for few more days.

1784
02:02:35,679 --> 02:02:36,851
How sweet, Veer!

1785
02:02:37,448 --> 02:02:41,658
Chautala, book a ticket
• after 2 days.. -No.

1786
02:02:42,186 --> 02:02:43,756
No.

1787
02:02:44,722 --> 02:02:45,894
It’s important for him to Ieave.

1788
02:02:46,657 --> 02:02:49,297
Control your emotion,
• not your brother.

1789
02:02:49,660 --> 02:02:50,764
Control.

1790
02:02:52,529 --> 02:02:53,701
Have a safe journey.

1791
02:02:55,566 --> 02:02:57,546
Come, sir. It’s time]
— forthe flight.

1792
02:02:58,402 --> 02:03:01,781
That’s ok. But I can’t
— go without gift.

1793
02:03:02,573 --> 02:03:05,019
Mary. -Sir. -Did you
— seethatgift?

1794
02:03:05,709 --> 02:03:07,416
Gift of King Bambata? -Yes.

1795

That treasure box type? -Yes.

1796
02:03:09,213 --> 02:03:11,022
Rectangular shape?
-l didn’t see it.

1797
02:03:11,815 --> 02:03:13,761
Mr. Dharam, that day
a thief came..

1798
02:03:14,051 --> 02:03:15,758
..and might have stolen
your gift

1799
02:03:16,220 --> 02:03:17,756
Yes, it must be very expensive.

1800
02:03:18,055 --> 02:03:19,295
Diamonds.

1801
02:03:19,723 --> 02:03:21,999
Let’s go to police to lodge a complain.

1802
02:03:22,059 --> 02:03:23,595
We’ll get the thief caught. -No.

1803
02:03:24,061 --> 02:03:25,972
It’s important for me]
to go to Losoto.

1804
02:03:26,363 --> 02:03:29,401
Correct. -Take another gift.

1805
02:03:29,667 --> 02:03:32,011
Here. This will solve
• your problems.

1806
02:03:48,786 --> 02:03:49,958
Who are they?

1807
02:03:50,821 --> 02:03:52,994
Didn’t you recognize them?
They collect donations.

1808
02:03:55,259 --> 02:03:56,431
Hey, what is it?

1809
02:03:57,594 --> 02:03:59,665
Corect the question?
—Ask who they’re?—’

1810
02:03:59,830 --> 02:04:01,571
He’s Tobu. Remember, GPL.

1811
02:04:01,765 --> 02:04:03,870
He’s head boy of GPL. He’s dumb.

1812
02:04:09,506 --> 02:04:11,349
Tobu says when wiII
— you pay5lakh.

1813
02:04:11,975 --> 02:04:13,477
5 Lakh.

1814
02:04:13,544 --> 02:04:16,650
Hey, are you demanding donation
or extortion money.

1815
02:04:24,621 --> 02:04:25,725
All the best.

1816
02:04:39,269 --> 02:04:41,647
Go away. I’ll pay letter. Go.

1817
02:04:43,607 --> 02:04:44,881
Go. We will come.

1818
02:04:52,049 --> 02:04:53,357
.Brother.

1819
02:05:20,978 --> 02:05:22,389
Tobu says..

1820
02:05:24,515 --> 02:05:26,688
..Tobu creates war..

1821
02:05:29,353 --> 02:05:30,798

02:05:48,005 --> 02:05:52,852
Sage! You’re a sage.

1830
02:05:54,511 --> 02:05:56,616
Your slap has magic.

1831
02:05:56,980 --> 02:06:00,257
You can make someone deaf
•or give voice to someone.

1832
02:06:00,717 --> 02:06:04,255
Sage, you’re great.

1833

02:06:14,665 --> 02:06:16,770
One slap cured me.

1838
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:18,707
I can speak.

1839
02:06:18,769 --> 02:06:23,275
My sage has worked magic.

1840
02:06:23,807 --> 02:06:25,753
Tobu can speak.

1841
02:06:25,976 --> 02:06:28,456
I waived your loan of 5 lakh.

1842
02:06:28,645 --> 02:06:29,885
Which loan?

1843
02:06:30,981 --> 02:06:32,790
Acutally.. -Let me talk, sage.

But they lost.

1848
02:06:42,526 --> 02:06:45,473
It was good. We got to meet.

1849
02:06:45,863 --> 02:06:48,469
You returned my voice..

1850
02:06:48,532 --> 02:06:50,512
..what can I give in return?

1851
02:06:50,734 --> 02:06:52,372
What can I give you, sage?

1852
02:06:52,436 --> 02:06:54,347
But I want to give you something.

1853
02:06:55,005 --> 02:06:59,454

Prem!- Where?

I thought Veer eloped
with Vidya..

No, dad. -You can’t
— do this, Vidya.
