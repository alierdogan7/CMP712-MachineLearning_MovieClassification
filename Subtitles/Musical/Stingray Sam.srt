00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,732
Liberty Chew Chewing Tobacco
presents...

2
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:11,637
<i>Stingray Sam is not a hero</i>

3
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:15,442
<i>But he does do the things
That folks don't do</i>

4
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:16,913
<i>That need to be done</i>

5
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:20,646
<i>He's got a bravery inside</i>

6
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:28,088
<i>That won't let him run away
Will not let him run</i>

7
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35,560
This is the planet Mars.

8
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:40,037
It was once known as the resort and
entertainment capital of the universe.

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,372
Over the years the appeal of Mars
has worn thin.

10
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:48,004
The ideas that its entertainment
industries were once based on

11
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:51,106
are no longer valued
among smart, young couples

12
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,242
looking for a good time.

13
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:56,686
No, Mars has seen its day.

14
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,280
Now it has become a home

15
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,586
for forgotten people
with shattered dreams

16
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:04,527
looking for that break
that just isn't there anymore.

17
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:08,032
These are today's visitors.

18
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:10,694
Then there are those
who occupy this planet.

19
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:14,137
The ones who capitalize on these,
the misfortunate.

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,299
But don't judge them too harshly.

21
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,501
They came to Mars

22
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,044
for the same reason
as everyone else,

23
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:23,582
only now they have
nowhere else to go.

24
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:41,065
<i>Welcome to Mars</i>

25
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:44,466
<i>Welcome to life among the stars</i>

26
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:50,339
<i>Welcome to hotels
And restaurants and bars</i>

27
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:54,903
<i>Where you'll never be homesick
Anymore</i>

28
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:08,157
<i>You'll live in space
Where you'll develop certain tastes</i>

29
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:13,790
<i>And certain views
On things you've never faced</i>

30
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,299
<i>Where you'll never be homesick
Anymore</i>

31
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:27,671
<i>You're in the dome
You're in the perfect home</i>

32
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,772
<i>Where sweet dreams
Mean everything</i>

33
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:34,877
<i>And memories can't hurt you</i>

34
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:38,385
<i>Here's where you'll stay</i>

35
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:46,990
<i>Where everything you ever knew
Is turned into something new to you</i>

36
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:52,831
<i>Where you'll never be homesick
Anymore</i>

37
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,451
All right.

38
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,791
Thank you very much,
and thanks for coming out tonight.

39
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,763
And now, it gives me a great deal
of pleasure to introduce to you

40
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,731
our dancers for this evening.

41
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:28,330
This is Heaven and Star
from Liberty Chew Chewing tobacco.

42
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:33,469
"Liberate yourself
with Liberty Chew tobacco

43
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,743
and join
the tobacco-chewing liberation."

44
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:39,647
These ladies will be handing out
free samples of tobacco later on.

45
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:43,848
So, stick around,
make yourselves at home,

46
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,652
there's a lot more entertainment
to come,

47
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:46,747
and if you have any problems,

48
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,726
just let me or the bartender know,
and we'll see what we can do about it.

49
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,855
Thank you very much.
You need this?

50
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,671
How we doing, Barnaby?

51
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:01,330
I'm not too sure, Stingray.

52
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,534
I think we might have
a little problem.

53
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,474
Where at?

54
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,576
That big fella sitting
at the end of the bar.

55
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,376
He's been acting kinda weird.

56
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,215
Oh, my.

57
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:21,190
That's what I'm talking about.

58
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,819
I think you're gonna
have to ask him to leave.

59
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:28,490
Hand me my asking-stick.

60
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,871
Whoa.

61
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,477
You got olive juice
on my asking-stick.

62
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:51,887
Well, what do you think
we ought to do about this?

63
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:54,016
I think you should leave.

64
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,460
- Not without you, Stingray Sam!
- Quasar Kid!

65
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:00,657
Barnaby, this here's The Quasar Kid.
Get him some olives!

66
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,258
Well, what brings you
to these parts, Kid?

67
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,234
Well, when I learned
you became a lounge singer,

68
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:06,805
I said, "Well, okay, then."

69
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:09,431
Well, all right, then.
What do you say?

70
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:12,340
- I say, okay.
- Well, all right.

71
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:50,348
Well, all right, Kid.
It's good to see your face.

72
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,044
It's good to see you, Stingray.

73
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:59,458
Well, Kid, I know you really didn't
come all this way for the olives.

74
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,322
What are you really doing here?

75
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,452
Well, some folks
caught up with me recently

76
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,930
and asked me if I wouldn't mind
paying off my debt to society.

77
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,261
As you might remember,

78
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,804
we hadn't finished doing that
at the time we left the prison.

79
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,394
What are you saying?

80
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,599
I'm saying there's
a little girl out there somewhere

81
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,970
in a whole lot of trouble.

82
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:20,739
And if you and I can help her,
we won't be wanted men.

83
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:24,914
You won't have to hide out here
in this dump anymore.

84
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,450
This is not a dump, Kid.

85
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,851
This is a nightclub,
and I am its lounge singer.

86
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:31,446
That may not mean a lot to you,

87
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,149
but it means a lot to me
and a lot of people

88
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,853
who come here to see
a lounge singer, and that's me.

89
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:38,988
I'm saying there's
a little girl in trouble.

90
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,430
Besides from earning our freedom,
it might be the only chance

91
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,832
you and I will ever get
to do something that's right.

92
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:45,836
And aren't you the one
who said you always hoped

93
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,133
to help somebody someday?

94
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,734
- Hell, no.
- Ah, come on Stingray.

95
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,674
Just do it for me, then.

96
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,373
I'm happy here, Kid,
and besides you,

97
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:58,279
there's nobody else out there
looking for me.

98
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:02,718
Well, if you won't do it for me,
will you do it for her?

99
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:12,431
Stingray Sam
came from the planet Durango.

100
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,693
The economy of Durango
was based

101
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,463
on the manufacturing
of rocket ships.

102
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,300
To meet the rising
costs of manufacturing

103
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:23,842
the planet's leaders shut down
production and moved the industry

104
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,309
to the far away planet of Mayberry,

105
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:28,505
where the population
was much more in need,

106
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,606
and therefore labor
much less expensive.

107
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:35,585
This created a desperate situation
for the citizens of Durango,

108
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:39,852
which resulted in a crime wave
that dominated the entire planet.

109
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,725
This problem was not acknowledged
by the Inter-Galactic Community

110
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,491
until the population of Durango

111
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,930
began drifting
toward the wealthier planets.

112
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,763
Sorry to interrupt the party.

113
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,531
I'm Stingray Sam,
this here's The Quasar Kid,

114
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,698
and we just got here from Durango.

115
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,469
To restore peace
throughout the galaxy

116
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,481
the United Planets Organization

117
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,916
created a new economic system
for the planet of Durango.

118
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:11,683
The former rocket-ship factories were
now to be used as penitentiaries.

119
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:16,023
One quarter of Durango's population
was given jobs as prison guards,

120
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:19,188
while the other three quarters
were incarcerated.

121
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,730
The cost of Durango prison labor
would be minimal.

122
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,065
With the rocket ship machinery
still in place

123
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,504
and with a prison population
of skilled factory workers,

124
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,475
it was the natural choice
for the leaders of Durango

125
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,772
to remove
all manufacturing contracts

126
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,110
from the now wealthy
planet of Mayberry

127
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:38,740
and reintroduce
the rocket-ship industry

128
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:42,116
to the prison population
of Durango.

129
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:45,987
Unfortunately, Mayberry held
its own in the rocket industry,

130
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:49,061
and Durango soon went bankrupt.

131
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,095
The penitentiaries
were shut down,

132
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,927
and all of the convicts
were released under the condition

133
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,399
that they would be called upon
at any given moment

134
00:08:56,502 --> 00:09:00,563
to resume paying their debt
to society.

135
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:17,984
- What happened?
- We got arrested.

136
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,523
By who?

137
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,616
Well, technically
it was me that arrested you,

138
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,958
but I got arrested first, and I always
kind of thought of us as a team.

139
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,555
Are you the one who hit me, Kid?

140
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,225
Yeah.

141
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:32,360
What the...?
Did you put this thing on me?

142
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:33,495
I had to.

143
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,131
They said if I didn't put one on you,
then mine would explode.

144
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:40,679
- That's just part of the deal.
- I guess I don't blame you, then.

145
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,543
What do we gotta do to get 'em off?

146
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:45,446
It's just one job.
We got to rescue a little girl.

147
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:48,452
Once we do that, these things
will fall right off, and we're done.

148
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:51,455
- That's it, huh?
- Yeah, well, we got off easy.

149
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,718
They got everybody else
picking up garbage.

150
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:55,851
I've seen that.

151
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,623
That kind of work never ends.

152
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,857
Yeah, well,
when we're done with this job

153
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,662
our debt to society
will be paid in full.

154
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,828
You and I will be free men
for the rest of our lives.

155
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:09,806
You couldn't have just told me that
back at the bar? You had to hit me?

156
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,570
I missed you, Stingray.

157
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,845
And so this was the beginning
of Stingray Sam

158
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,714
and The Quasar Kid's
final adventure.

159
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,052
But what dangers will they face
on the road to becoming free men?

160
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:28,149
Find out
on our next episode of...

161
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,787
<i>...Stingray Sam!</i>

162
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:57,152
Liberty Chew Chewing Tobacco
presents...

163
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:03,921
<i>Stingray Sam is not a hero</i>

164
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:07,692
<i>But he does do the things
That folks don't do</i>

165
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,165
<i>That need to be done</i>

166
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:13,261
<i>He's got a bravery inside</i>

167
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:20,270
<i>That won't let him run away
Will not let him run</i>

168
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:27,810
Children.
So young and irresponsible.

169
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,414
How quickly they mature
and turn into incompetent adults.

170
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:36,290
Incompetent in management
and administrative duties.

171
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,953
It was this form of incompetence

172
00:11:38,063 --> 00:11:40,657
that sent Stingray Sam
and The Quasar Kid

173
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,599
on a mission
without any information.

174
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:46,398
The only detail they were to receive
was to be administered

175
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:50,441
at the Inter-galactic
Hall Of Records And Trivia.

176
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:56,742
It is here where we now find our boys
perched in a state of readiness.

177
00:12:04,923 --> 00:12:06,390
34.

178
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,761
34.

179
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:19,337
34.

180
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,982
36.

181
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:35,580
36.

182
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:40,450
36.

183
00:12:43,962 --> 00:12:45,725
No 36.

184
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,403
35.

185
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:00,444
Here you go, Ma'am.

186
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,741
I'm Stingray Sam,
this here's The Quasar Kid,

187
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:03,974
and we're from Durango.

188
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,017
- You don't say.
- Yes, Ma'am.

189
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,380
We're on an assignment,

190
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,420
and we don't know
what we're supposed to be doing.

191
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:12,854
- What's your assignment?
- We're supposed to rescue a girl.

192
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,153
- Who's the girl?
- We don't know.

193
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,091
We're from the work program.

194
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,030
Give me your wrists.

195
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,449
Just one box?

196
00:13:45,557 --> 00:13:47,957
That's all I have for you.

197
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,925
Could you tell me
where I could find...?

198
00:13:50,028 --> 00:13:52,428
38.

199
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,934
If I leave this bag here, do you
think somebody else could use it?

200
00:13:57,035 --> 00:14:04,532
Yes. And they'll be so happy,
and I'll tell them it came from you.

201
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,842
38.

202
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,209
No, I don't think it was stupid.

203
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,948
You had a plastic bag,
and you didn't need it.

204
00:14:18,056 --> 00:14:19,956
You thought somebody else
could use it.

205
00:14:20,058 --> 00:14:23,255
Well, either way, you know what
that lady did when she just said that?

206
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,624
What?

207
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,198
She made our day.
That's what she did.

208
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,664
I think that lady is a genius.

209
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:31,793
Just that one thing she said
made our whole day worthwhile.

210
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:33,565
Well, I'm glad something did.

211
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:36,470
It takes 20 of these darn
little boxes to figure out anything,

212
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,702
and I don't think
it's gonna tell us much.

213
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:41,541
Well, let's have a look-see.

214
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,441
To a father in a middle-class home,

215
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:50,579
no one is more important
than "Daddy's little girl."

216
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:54,523
Unfortunately, the extremely wealthy
and the extremely poor fathers

217
00:14:54,626 --> 00:14:56,856
cannot share in this sentiment.

218
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:00,829
A female child born to a poor family
may find herself

219
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:04,528
in compromising situations
in the name of survival.

220
00:15:04,636 --> 00:15:09,573
The father of a dynasty would need
a son to carry on the family name.

221
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:14,608
It was long believed that a child's
gender was determined by its mother.

222
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,772
King Henry Vlll believed it.

223
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:18,782
He executed several of his wives

224
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:21,682
because they were unable
to bear him a son.

225
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:23,812
If Henry only knew
what we know today

226
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,889
perhaps he would have
cut of his own head.

227
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:29,950
Still, gender-decisive pills
were created for the woman to take

228
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,030
until five generations ago

229
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,531
when a pill was invented
to give the father the choice.

230
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:39,661
The wealthy and poor alike
began having sons exclusively.

231
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:42,535
As a result, the poor
and the wealthy classes

232
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,575
found themselves
on the brink of extinction

233
00:15:44,676 --> 00:15:46,974
until cloning was introduced
to the upper class

234
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:51,038
as a mandatory measure
to generate the next generation.

235
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:54,607
But health risks linked to cloning
drained the economy

236
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,950
through increased
medical expenses.

237
00:15:57,055 --> 00:15:59,148
In its last attempt for survival,

238
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:02,421
strange new theories
were openly developed,

239
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,359
but time was running out,

240
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,591
and things were looking bleak
for the upper class

241
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:09,189
until two scientists

242
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,963
known only as Edward and Frederick

243
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,163
developed a radical new procedure.

244
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:15,604
They had successfully

245
00:16:15,707 --> 00:16:16,901
blended their DNA

246
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,806
and then placed the living embryo

247
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,606
into the body of the scientist

248
00:16:20,712 --> 00:16:23,044
know only as Frederick.

249
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,209
Funding was immediately pulled

250
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,944
from all research programs

251
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,646
and awarded
to Edward and Frederick.

252
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,313
When the child was born,

253
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:34,290
he was given the name Fredward.

254
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:37,328
The entire upper-class population
was impregnated

255
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:43,732
with double male genetic combos,
and thus a new generation was born!

256
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:03,053
<i>Frederick and Edward
Had a baby named Fredward</i>

257
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:08,320
<i>Frederick and Edward
Loved their gentle son</i>

258
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:14,264
<i>Frederick was the world's
Only pregnant man</i>

259
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,103
<i>Edward might not have been the one</i>

260
00:17:20,238 --> 00:17:22,934
<i>Frederick and Edward
Had a son named Fredward</i>

261
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,805

And this baby, his daddy's gone</i>

336
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:26,725
And so the plot begins to thicken,
but not by much.

337
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,424
A girl is in need of rescue,

338
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:31,900
and the genetically designed
figurehead of a very wealthy planet

339
00:19:32,003 --> 00:19:33,903
is somehow involved.

340
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:35,666
But how? Who?

341
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,401
What? When?

342
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,306
Where?

343
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,901
And why?

344
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:43,674
Find out the answers
to these questions and more

<i>Stingray Sam is not a hero</i>

00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:29,692
<i>He's got a bravery inside</i>

352
00:20:31,095 --> 00:20:36,658
<i>That won't let him run away
Will not let him run</i>

353
00:20:41,138 --> 00:20:45,336
In a distant solar system, located
among a certain class of planets,

354
00:20:45,443 --> 00:20:47,377
were the planets of social classes,

355
00:20:47,478 --> 00:20:50,413
and among them
was a planet of a certain class.

356
00:20:50,514 --> 00:20:53,915
A planet that had changed its name
to Fredward.

357
00:20:54,018 --> 00:20:56,816
It is here where Stingray Sam
and The Quasar Kid

358
00:20:56,921 --> 00:21:00,982
initiate their pursuit of a man
who bears that same name.

359
00:21:01,092 --> 00:21:03,117
Their search begins...

360
00:21:03,227 --> 00:21:06,025
...at the Pregnant Man's
Science and Trivia Institute,

361
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,324
where an important meeting

362
00:21:07,431 --> 00:21:09,956
of The Pregnant Man's Institute
of Science and Trivia

363
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:12,501
is about to take place.

364
00:21:21,212 --> 00:21:23,737
They took my clipboard!
They took my clipboard!

365
00:21:23,848 --> 00:21:27,944
The one I use!
Somebody stop them!

366
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:42,294
The triumphant efforts
of this new brand of research

367
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,096
could not have been possible
without this generous grant

368
00:21:45,202 --> 00:21:49,002
from the Liberty Chew
Chewing Tobacco Corporation.

369
00:21:49,106 --> 00:21:52,098
"Liberate yourself
with Liberty Chew Chewing tobacco

370
00:21:52,209 --> 00:21:55,940
and join
the tobacco-chewing liberation."

371
00:21:56,047 --> 00:21:59,539
Before we recess this afternoon,
Dr. Adison and I

372
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,744
will be handing out
free samples of Liberty Chew.

373
00:22:02,853 --> 00:22:06,584
And now,
let's have a look at the chart.

374
00:22:11,729 --> 00:22:14,789
I'm The Quasar Kid,
and this here's Stingray Sam!

375
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:16,866
You boys are in
for a world of trouble

376
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:19,368
if you don't give us
what we came here to get!

377
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:23,566
"Stingray" Sam? Are you
from the Oceanology Department?

378
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,002
Yes, I am.

379
00:22:27,111 --> 00:22:30,080
Well, this is a surprise.

380
00:22:30,247 --> 00:22:31,976
Ever since the oceans have died,
I can't imagine

381
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:34,847
where you could have found
any funding without a gunman.

382
00:22:35,886 --> 00:22:39,982
Unless, of course, you found a way
to bring the oceans back to life,

383
00:22:40,091 --> 00:22:42,889
which I honestly doubt.

384
00:22:45,062 --> 00:22:47,690
How are you planning to do it,
young man?

385
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:48,992
Excuse me?

386
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,467
Well, I mean, how are you planning
to bring the oceans back to life?

387
00:22:53,671 --> 00:22:56,037
One fish at a time, I guess.

388
00:22:57,575 --> 00:22:58,940
Yeah, that's right.

389
00:22:59,043 --> 00:23:01,773
Sam here's come halfway
across two galaxies

390
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:06,543
with a Stingray baby
growing inside his very own belly!

391
00:23:06,717 --> 00:23:08,309
- A Stingray?
- Stingray?

392
00:23:08,652 --> 00:23:09,641
Stingray...

393
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,415
<i>Stingray, Stingray, Stingray</i>

394
00:23:13,691 --> 00:23:17,889
<i>Stingray, Stingray, Stingray</i>

395
00:23:25,569 --> 00:23:29,562
<i>Well, I went to the doctor</i>

396
00:23:29,673 --> 00:23:31,732
<i>And he gave me a sonogram</i>

397
00:23:31,842 --> 00:23:35,243
<i>Not the kind of thing
That you do to a man</i>

398
00:23:35,813 --> 00:23:39,772
<i>I said, "Doctor,
What does that picture say?"</i>

399
00:23:39,884 --> 00:23:43,581
<i>He said, "Boy,
You're gonna have a Stingray"</i>

400
00:23:43,788 --> 00:23:47,849
<i>Stingray, Stingray, Stingray</i>

401
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:51,894
<i>Stingray, Stingray, Stingray</i>

402
00:23:51,996 --> 00:23:53,793
<i>- Is it gonna be a boy?
- No, it's gonna be a Stingray</i>

403
00:23:53,898 --> 00:23:56,025
<i>- Will it be a girl?
- No, it's gonna be a Stingray</i>

404
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:59,864
<i>Will it be the Prince of Thieves
Or Queen of The World?</i>

405
00:24:00,137 --> 00:24:03,937
<i>Will it be a son
Or will it be a daughter?</i>

406
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:06,976
<i>Will it be a Stingray
Swimming in the water?</i>

407
00:24:07,378 --> 00:24:11,371
<i>Stingray, Stingray, Stingray</i>

408
00:24:11,682 --> 00:24:15,618
<i>Stingray, Stingray, Stingray</i>

409
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:03,824
My friend here
ain't feeling quite right.

410
00:25:03,934 --> 00:25:07,961
Maybe it's because he's got
a baby Stingray in his stomach.

411
00:25:08,672 --> 00:25:10,139
Yeah, that's probably what it is.

412
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:13,074
Anyway, I need
to go sit down for a while,

413
00:25:13,177 --> 00:25:15,941
and I was wondering where
you keep all your files and records

414
00:25:16,046 --> 00:25:17,035
and stuff like that.

415
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:20,174
We thought we'd go take a look-see.

416
00:25:20,284 --> 00:25:22,775
Through the door
at the end of the hall.

417
00:25:22,887 --> 00:25:25,583
And what exactly is a "look-see"?

418
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:29,056
Don't you worry about it.

419
00:25:47,411 --> 00:25:49,902
This don't look so good.

420
00:25:50,014 --> 00:25:53,279
Yeah, we got a lot of looking to do.

421
00:25:55,753 --> 00:25:57,084
Well, if there's only one girl,

422
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:59,019
then maybe we should look
in the girl section,

423
00:25:59,123 --> 00:26:01,284
and we'll find her.

424
00:26:04,161 --> 00:26:07,722
You're right.
It's the only pink one.

425
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,691
Well, let's give her a try.

426
00:26:16,907 --> 00:26:19,899
The upper class
had become the only class.

427
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:22,103
To make it possible
for society to function,

428
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:23,407
it became an unwritten law

429
00:26:23,514 --> 00:26:26,278
that physical labor
would not be looked down upon,

430
00:26:26,383 --> 00:26:29,147
as long as you were famous at it.

431
00:26:29,253 --> 00:26:32,188
Jerry was a famous carpenter,

432
00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:35,816
but fame was of no interest
to Famous Jerry.

433
00:26:35,926 --> 00:26:39,020
He was a loner, a rebel.

434
00:26:39,129 --> 00:26:43,122
So unlike the norm
was Famous Jerry the Carpenter

435
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:46,761
that he protested his obligation
to reproduce a male child

436
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:50,829
by secretly taking
gender-decisive drugs.

437
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,602
Jerry privately gave birth
to a female child.

438
00:26:53,711 --> 00:26:55,110
Her gender was assumed male

439
00:26:55,212 --> 00:26:59,342
and therefore never reported
to the authorities.

440
00:27:00,017 --> 00:27:03,043
Fredward had always been
a stranger to effort.

441
00:27:03,153 --> 00:27:06,850
He had achieved his wealth and fame
through the act of being born.

442
00:27:06,957 --> 00:27:09,858
His every need
had forever been fulfilled,

443
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,987
and though he grew up in seclusion,
he was never alone.

444
00:27:14,098 --> 00:27:17,363
He had always been surrounded
by a group of wealthy young followers

445
00:27:17,468 --> 00:27:19,595
who valued his every word.

446
00:27:19,703 --> 00:27:22,536
His ideas were never questioned.

447
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,865
As a result, Fredward was convinced

448
00:27:24,975 --> 00:27:28,672
that his thoughts were the product
of divine inspiration.

449
00:27:29,847 --> 00:27:32,873
Though he had never developed
any skills and had no talents,

450
00:27:32,983 --> 00:27:35,247
he declared himself an artist,

451
00:27:35,352 --> 00:27:38,185
and to the amazement
of his followers,

452
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:41,417
Fredward began
what was to be his masterpiece.

453
00:27:41,525 --> 00:27:46,326
He was going to redesign
his own living quarters,

454
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:50,366
and the only man famous enough
to make this dream come true

455
00:27:50,467 --> 00:27:54,369
was Famous Jerry the Carpenter.

456
00:27:54,471 --> 00:27:57,998
Famous Jerry was sequestered
within the compound.

457
00:27:58,108 --> 00:28:01,874
He was forced to listen
to Fredward's high-art concepts.

458
00:28:01,979 --> 00:28:04,209
None of Fredward's ideas
were based in reality.

459
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:06,044
They could never be achieved.

460
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:10,450
After one week,
Famous Jerry quit the job.

461
00:28:10,554 --> 00:28:12,351
Fredward was devastated.

462
00:28:12,456 --> 00:28:16,392
Jerry was to be arrested
and sentenced to death.

463
00:28:16,493 --> 00:28:20,224
Before Jerry had a chance to retrieve
his daughter and flee the planet,

464
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:22,731
their home was broken into
and searched.

465
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:26,826
The girl was discovered and taken
directly to the Fredward Compound.

466
00:28:26,937 --> 00:28:30,236
Famous Jerry fled the planet alone.

467
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:31,831
Jerry reported the kidnapping

468
00:28:31,942 --> 00:28:34,376
to leaders
of the Inter-Galactic Community.

469
00:28:34,478 --> 00:28:38,005
Arrangements
for her rescue were made.

470
00:29:00,904 --> 00:29:05,000
- Are you leaving us so soon?
- Yeah. We gotta get going.

471
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:08,510
- Where will you be going?
- To find Fredward.

472
00:29:08,612 --> 00:29:12,013
Oh, no more cheese and tobacco
for these boys.

473
00:29:12,116 --> 00:29:13,811
They're off to see Fredward.

474
00:29:13,917 --> 00:29:16,010
You'll never see Fredward,
young man.

475
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,587
He's far too important.

476
00:29:18,355 --> 00:29:19,947
Thank you for your hospitality.

477
00:29:20,057 --> 00:29:21,524
Oh, and by the way,

478
00:29:21,692 --> 00:29:24,786
you said you had traveled
halfway across two galaxies?

479
00:29:24,895 --> 00:29:26,453
There's only one galaxy.

480
00:29:28,232 --> 00:29:31,099
Yeah, that sounds about right.

481
00:29:31,201 --> 00:29:33,032
With an understanding
of their mission

482
00:29:33,137 --> 00:29:35,970
and a sense of purpose
behind their every step,

483
00:29:36,073 --> 00:29:40,874
Stingray Sam and The Quasar Kid
set forth to the Fredward Compound.

484
00:29:40,978 --> 00:29:42,468
But what dangers await?

485
00:29:42,579 --> 00:29:45,377
Find out on our next episode of...

486
00:29:45,482 --> 00:29:49,145
<i>...Stingray Sam!</i>

487
00:30:10,507 --> 00:30:14,273
Liberty Chew Chewing Tobacco
presents...

488
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:21,207
<i>Stingray Sam is not a hero</i>

489
00:30:21,317 --> 00:30:24,878
<i>But he does do the things
That folks don't do</i>

490
00:30:25,188 --> 00:30:26,450
<i>That need to be done</i>

491
00:30:26,556 --> 00:30:30,117
<i>He's got a bravery inside</i>

492
00:30:31,794 --> 00:30:37,391
<i>That won't let him run away
Will not let him run</i>

493
00:30:42,605 --> 00:30:44,800
Our story begins where it left off.

494
00:30:44,908 --> 00:30:47,468
Here, among
that certain class of planets

495
00:30:47,577 --> 00:30:50,637
where we find Stingray Sam
and The Quasar Kid

496
00:30:50,747 --> 00:30:54,308
in pursuit of a man named Fredward.

497
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:57,648
Like every icon
of every great economic power,

498
00:30:57,754 --> 00:31:00,222
Fredward was well protected.

499
00:31:00,323 --> 00:31:03,349
He lived in a grand fortress
above the law

500
00:31:03,459 --> 00:31:07,088
where no man dare enter
without an invitation.

501
00:31:07,196 --> 00:31:08,356
It was because of this

502
00:31:08,464 --> 00:31:10,557
that no security system
was maintained,

503
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:13,261
making it possible
for Stingray Sam and The Quasar Kid

504
00:31:13,369 --> 00:31:15,860
to gain entrance.

505
00:31:20,543 --> 00:31:21,339
Hey!

506
00:31:22,745 --> 00:31:24,770
You're not supposed
to be back here.

507
00:31:24,881 --> 00:31:27,907
No one is supposed to see me
before the performance.

508
00:31:28,017 --> 00:31:29,609
What performance?

509
00:31:29,719 --> 00:31:31,619
You're here for the party,
aren't you?

510
00:31:31,721 --> 00:31:33,951
What party?

511
00:31:36,726 --> 00:31:38,591
Yeah, we're here for the party.

512
00:31:43,633 --> 00:31:45,601
Do you remember
what happened back on Durango

513
00:31:45,702 --> 00:31:49,604
just before the prisons
went bankrupt and they let us all go?

514
00:31:49,706 --> 00:31:53,142
- You mean the Mascot program?
- Yeah.

515
00:31:53,242 --> 00:31:53,901
Yeah.

516
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:56,535
I was in a solitary-confinement suit

517
00:31:56,646 --> 00:31:59,479
that looked
like the Liberty Chew Grasshopper.

518
00:31:59,582 --> 00:32:01,140
I couldn't move my arms.

519
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:05,050
Yeah. Well, when you were gone,
they gave me a new cellmate.

520
00:32:05,855 --> 00:32:09,552
His name was Cubby.

521
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:17,192
<i>Excuse me
I'm new here in this prison</i>

522
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:23,296
<i>I think that I was sitting there
See, there's my piece of cornbread</i>

523
00:32:23,406 --> 00:32:26,466
It was said that Cubby
was not right for prison,

524
00:32:26,576 --> 00:32:29,739
or perhaps prison
just wasn't right for Cubby.

525
00:32:29,846 --> 00:32:33,680
Either way, his timing
could not have been more perfect

526
00:32:33,783 --> 00:32:35,910
for the Durango prison facilities

527
00:32:36,019 --> 00:32:39,250
were on the brink
of financial disaster.

528
00:32:39,355 --> 00:32:41,880
It was during these,
the darkest of hours,

529
00:32:41,991 --> 00:32:46,860
when an advertising firm approached
the planet's CEO with a proposal.

530
00:32:46,963 --> 00:32:52,560
It was to be known as "The Corporate
Mascot Rehabilitation Program."

531
00:32:52,735 --> 00:32:57,468
In this program, prisoners were
rented out as corporate mascots.

532
00:32:57,573 --> 00:33:00,633
Mascot costumes
were designed and manufactured

533
00:33:00,743 --> 00:33:02,335
within the prison facility.

534
00:33:02,445 --> 00:33:06,381
The exteriors of these costumes
were designed to attract and amuse

535
00:33:06,482 --> 00:33:08,780
happy conventioneers
and their families

536
00:33:08,885 --> 00:33:09,874
while reminding them

537
00:33:09,986 --> 00:33:12,511
of the corporations
they were representing.

538
00:33:12,622 --> 00:33:16,683
The interiors of the costumes
were designed to restrain the inmates

539
00:33:16,793 --> 00:33:18,818
in order to keep them
from committing crimes

540
00:33:18,928 --> 00:33:21,920
or from endangering themselves
and those around them.

541
00:33:22,031 --> 00:33:25,592
When a prisoner became suicidal,
his attempts would fail

542
00:33:25,702 --> 00:33:29,798
while appearing comical
and charming to any onlookers.

543
00:33:29,906 --> 00:33:32,875
Eventually hygiene became an issue.

544
00:33:32,975 --> 00:33:36,638
The smell of an unwashed prisoner
would penetrate the costume

545
00:33:36,746 --> 00:33:39,738
and give the corporation
it represented a bad name.

546
00:33:39,849 --> 00:33:43,285
A new approach
was quickly put into effect.

547
00:33:43,386 --> 00:33:46,014
Through the use
of mass/matter compression,

548
00:33:46,122 --> 00:33:48,590
a prisoner could be reduced in size,

549
00:33:48,691 --> 00:33:51,558
infused into the body
of a small robot,

550
00:33:51,661 --> 00:33:53,288
dressed accordingly,

551
00:33:53,396 --> 00:33:55,796
and placed on a shelf
for public viewing.

552
00:33:55,898 --> 00:33:59,925
No personal contact
was ever made with the public.

553
00:34:00,036 --> 00:34:03,563
Cubby was a master
at mass/matter compression.

554
00:34:03,673 --> 00:34:06,733
Without him, Durango
would not have had a program.

555
00:34:06,843 --> 00:34:09,505
Cubby requested that he be allowed
to develop the device

556
00:34:09,612 --> 00:34:11,580
in the privacy of his cell.

557
00:34:11,681 --> 00:34:14,479
His request was granted,
and in a short while

558
00:34:14,584 --> 00:34:18,076
six prototypes
were developed and delivered.

559
00:34:18,187 --> 00:34:21,315
Two additional devices
were secretly manufactured

560
00:34:21,424 --> 00:34:24,052
and hidden
behind the wall of his cell.

561
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,687
These two devices were to be worn
by Cubby and The Quasar Kid

562
00:34:27,797 --> 00:34:31,426
while escaping through the prison's
tiny ventilation system.

563
00:34:31,534 --> 00:34:33,661
On the morning
of their planned escape,

564
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:37,570
Cubby infused himself
within one of the tiny suits.

565
00:34:37,673 --> 00:34:41,473
He hid behind the toilet
and waited for The Quasar Kid

566
00:34:41,577 --> 00:34:43,602
to finish his kitchen duty.

567
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:48,713
Kid was distracted
and unable to join Cubby as planned.

568
00:34:48,818 --> 00:34:51,810
As Cubby patiently waited
behind the toilet,

569
00:34:51,921 --> 00:34:55,516
a prison janitor
hosed down their cell.

570
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:58,355
The water
short-circuited Cubby's suit.

571
00:34:58,461 --> 00:35:00,588
He was killed within seconds.

572
00:35:00,696 --> 00:35:04,564
When Kid returned to their cell,
he discovered the miniature device

573
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:08,330
that contained
the tiny remains of his friend.

574
00:35:08,437 --> 00:35:11,531
Only then did he remember
their escape plan.

575
00:35:11,641 --> 00:35:14,542
Cubby was secretly buried
the following morning

576
00:35:14,644 --> 00:35:16,612
in the prison community garden.

577
00:35:18,147 --> 00:35:20,172
And you expect me
to get into that thing?

578
00:35:20,283 --> 00:35:23,616
- It's easy. Just close your eyes.
- No! Hey! Hey! Hey!

579
00:35:27,657 --> 00:35:29,022
How's it feel?

580
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:31,652
It's a little tight.

581
00:35:32,628 --> 00:35:35,791
- I think my leg's asleep.
- Can you move it?

582
00:35:35,898 --> 00:35:38,423
- Yeah, I think so.
- Well, just keep moving it.

583
00:35:38,534 --> 00:35:41,264
You'll be all right.
Now, hang on to my pant leg.

584
00:35:49,212 --> 00:35:54,275
Allow me to introduce our visitors.

585
00:35:54,584 --> 00:36:00,181
I must ask you to excuse their
somewhat lackadaisical manners,

586
00:36:00,289 --> 00:36:06,751
but I have conditioned them,
or brainwashed them.

587
00:36:06,863 --> 00:36:11,266
You will notice that I have told them
that they may smoke.

588
00:36:11,567 --> 00:36:13,501
I've allowed my people
to have a little fun

589
00:36:13,603 --> 00:36:17,630
in the selection
of bizarre tobacco substitutes.

590
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:20,641
Are you enjoying your cigarette, Ed?

591
00:36:20,743 --> 00:36:21,937
Yes, Fredward.

592
00:36:22,044 --> 00:36:27,141
Oh, tastes good,
like a cigarette should.

593
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:33,911
And now, comrades,
may I introduce the famous...

594
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:40,017
Can I help you?

595
00:36:42,765 --> 00:36:46,633
<i>Party, it's a party
Come on, party, get retarded</i>

596
00:36:48,871 --> 00:36:51,704
<i>Party, it's a party
Come on, party, get retarded</i>

597
00:36:51,941 --> 00:36:54,842
<i>Party, it's a party
Come on, party, get it started</i>

598
00:36:54,944 --> 00:36:57,811
<i>Party, it's a party
Come on party, get retarded</i>

599
00:36:59,582 --> 00:37:02,949
<i>Party, get it started
Party, it's a party, come on, party</i>

600
00:37:03,052 --> 00:37:04,314
<i>Get retarded</i>

601
00:37:32,915 --> 00:37:34,678
Oh, man, you scared me!

602
00:37:34,784 --> 00:37:36,752
You're the Carpenter's daughter.

603
00:37:36,852 --> 00:37:38,683
I'm here to take you
back to your daddy.

604
00:37:38,854 --> 00:37:42,051
I'm gonna need your help
getting us out of here.

605
00:37:42,158 --> 00:37:44,626
I think your legs look cool.

606
00:37:44,727 --> 00:37:49,926
Oh. Thank you very much.
They're not really mine.

607
00:37:50,032 --> 00:37:52,933
- Can I see them?
- Yeah, sure.

608
00:37:53,035 --> 00:37:54,525
Now, we don't have very much time,

609
00:37:54,637 --> 00:37:56,662
so I need you
to listen to me very carefully.

610
00:37:56,772 --> 00:37:58,603
This is gonna be a little bit tricky,

611
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:01,541
and a little bit dangerous,
but I'm gonna get you out of here.

612
00:38:01,644 --> 00:38:04,374
Now, what I need you to do is run.

613
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,942
Did you hear me?
Run! Run!

614
00:38:06,048 --> 00:38:07,675
Okay!

615
00:38:30,339 --> 00:38:33,900
- I ran really fast!
- Yeah, you did.

616
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:37,537
- Can we go see my daddy now?
- As soon as The Kid gets back.

617
00:38:37,646 --> 00:38:38,943
It shouldn't take him very long.

618
00:38:39,048 --> 00:38:42,142
If I know The Kid, he won't stay
in there any longer than he has to.

619
00:38:42,251 --> 00:38:44,685
<i>Party, it's a party
It's a party, get it started</i>

620
00:38:45,287 --> 00:38:47,949
<i>Party, it's a party
It's a party, get it started</i>

621
00:38:48,157 --> 00:38:50,853
<i>Party, it's a party
It's a party, get it started</i>

622
00:38:51,027 --> 00:38:53,689
<i>Party, it's a party
It's a party, get it started</i>

623
00:38:53,863 --> 00:38:56,297
<i>Party, it's a party
It's a party, get it started</i>

624
00:38:56,465 --> 00:38:58,899
<i>Party, it's a party
It's a party, get it started</i>

625
00:38:59,068 --> 00:39:01,263
<i>Party, it's a party
It's a party, get it started</i>

626
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,836
<i>Party, it's a party
It's a party, get it started</i>

627
00:39:04,006 --> 00:39:07,032
Stingray Sam and the girl
waited onboard the ship,

628
00:39:07,143 --> 00:39:09,134
but what of The Quasar Kid?

629
00:39:09,245 --> 00:39:11,873
Had Fredward
discovered their plans?

630
00:39:11,981 --> 00:39:14,006
Had The Quasar Kid
been brainwashed

631
00:39:14,116 --> 00:39:15,913
for Fredward's amusement?

632
00:39:16,018 --> 00:39:18,145
Would the girl ever see her father,

633
00:39:18,254 --> 00:39:23,055
and will Stingray Sam remain
a tiny, little robot indefinitely?

634
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:26,185
Find out on our next episode of...

635
00:39:26,295 --> 00:39:30,095
<i>...Stingray Sam!</i>

636
00:39:49,251 --> 00:39:52,982
Liberty Chew Chewing Tobacco
presents...

637
00:39:55,891 --> 00:39:59,952
<i>Stingray Sam is not a hero</i>

638
00:40:00,062 --> 00:40:03,759
<i>But he does do the things
That folks don't do</i>

639
00:40:03,865 --> 00:40:05,093
<i>That need to be done</i>

640
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,829
<i>He's got a bravery inside</i>

641
00:40:10,405 --> 00:40:16,105
<i>That won't let him run away
Will not let him run</i>

642
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:24,784
It was a long night of angst,
anxiety and apprehension

643
00:40:24,886 --> 00:40:28,014
for Stingray Sam
and the Carpenter's daughter.

644
00:40:28,123 --> 00:40:30,216
They waited
for what felt like an eternity

645
00:40:30,325 --> 00:40:32,225
for the return of The Quasar Kid,

646
00:40:32,327 --> 00:40:36,286
and by this point, they could
only fear the worst had transpired

647
00:40:36,398 --> 00:40:38,889
and were beginning to give up hope,

648
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,661
when suddenly...

649
00:40:43,872 --> 00:40:46,568
Morning, Stingray. Ma'am.

650
00:40:47,042 --> 00:40:51,035
- And where were you last night?
- How'd you get out of the suit?

651
00:40:51,146 --> 00:40:53,273
The girl let me out.
Where were you?

652
00:40:53,382 --> 00:40:54,940
I was keeping
Fredward and the boys busy

653
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:57,245
so you could get the girl
and get on out of there.

654
00:40:57,352 --> 00:40:58,876
We were out of there
in two minutes.

655
00:40:58,987 --> 00:41:01,717
How was I supposed to know that?

656
00:41:01,823 --> 00:41:03,347
I was gettin' ready
to fly out of here.

657
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:08,122
- We were gonna leave you a note.
- You would never have done that.

658
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:10,596
Show him your note.

659
00:41:17,205 --> 00:41:20,231
That's a mighty nice note.
Thank you.

660
00:41:21,676 --> 00:41:25,442
Let's fly out of here
before they figure out she's missing.

661
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:28,341
Stingray Sam, The Quasar Kid,

662
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:32,511
and the Carpenter's daughter were
able to escape the planet unnoticed,

663
00:41:32,621 --> 00:41:35,146
but back
at the Fredward Compound,

664
00:41:35,257 --> 00:41:38,090
a flurry of activity
was taking place.

665
00:41:38,193 --> 00:41:40,354
The Artist,
who had originally been hired

666
00:41:40,462 --> 00:41:42,293
to perform at Fredward's party,

667
00:41:42,397 --> 00:41:45,764
was discovered gagged and bound
in his dressing room.

668
00:41:45,867 --> 00:41:50,065
At the same time, the Carpenter's
daughter was found to be missing.

669
00:41:50,172 --> 00:41:52,333
But it was the absence
of The Quasar Kid

670
00:41:52,441 --> 00:41:55,569
that pushed Fredward over the edge.

671
00:41:55,677 --> 00:41:59,443
He had not felt such a loss
since Famous Jerry the Carpenter

672
00:41:59,548 --> 00:42:01,448
had abandoned him.

673
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:04,144
Fredward's disciples
tried to comfort Fredward

674
00:42:04,252 --> 00:42:06,345
by belittling The Quasar Kid.

675
00:42:06,455 --> 00:42:09,947
They tried to discredit his
participation in the evening's events.

676
00:42:10,058 --> 00:42:12,959
They callously mocked his dancing.

677
00:42:14,196 --> 00:42:16,096
Fredward became furious.

678
00:42:16,198 --> 00:42:18,666
He scolded them
in defense of The Quasar Kid

679
00:42:18,967 --> 00:42:21,197
and had them arrested
for trespassing.

680
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:25,436
When the police had taken away
the last of his guests,

681
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:29,499
Fredward did something
that he had never done before.

682
00:42:29,678 --> 00:42:32,146
He left the compound.

683
00:42:32,247 --> 00:42:35,842
His anger gave him a bravery
that he had never known.

684
00:42:35,951 --> 00:42:39,148
In an abandoned rocket ship
of a convicted guest

685
00:42:39,254 --> 00:42:43,122
Fredward escaped
his planet unnoticed.

686
00:42:54,402 --> 00:42:57,428
- Hey, did you brush your teeth?
- Yeah.

687
00:43:01,243 --> 00:43:02,904
Did you use
that white toothbrush I gave you?

688
00:43:03,011 --> 00:43:05,172
- Yeah.
- All right. Go to bed.

689
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,408
- Can you play me a song on that?
- No.

690
00:43:09,284 --> 00:43:11,047
Yes.

691
00:43:11,152 --> 00:43:12,244
Go get into bed.

692
00:43:23,031 --> 00:43:26,228
<i>This here's a lullaby</i>

693
00:43:26,334 --> 00:43:29,735
<i>It's a song to go to sleep by</i>

694
00:43:30,038 --> 00:43:36,671
<i>Close your eyes while my friend
And I here sing you a lullaby</i>

695
00:43:36,778 --> 00:43:39,872
<i>Listen to the words of the song</i>

696
00:43:40,448 --> 00:43:43,906
<i>They're are all about cats and dogs</i>

697
00:43:44,019 --> 00:43:50,686
<i>Cats and dogs and stars in the sky
In a pretty little lullaby</i>

698
00:43:50,792 --> 00:43:54,193
<i>In a pretty little lullaby</i>

699
00:44:01,269 --> 00:44:04,602
<i>Close your eyes</i>

700
00:44:04,706 --> 00:44:07,334
<i>Shut them down tight</i>

701
00:44:08,143 --> 00:44:11,704
<i>Stars in the sky, shining up bright</i>

702
00:44:11,813 --> 00:44:15,146
<i>Everything will be all right</i>

703
00:44:15,317 --> 00:44:17,751
<i>Here comes the Sandman</i>

704
00:44:18,486 --> 00:44:21,478
<i>With a pocket full of sleep dirt</i>

705
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:25,082
<i>He's not a bad man
Not as bad as he seems</i>

706
00:44:25,193 --> 00:44:28,788
<i>And he'll get you dreaming
Your baby dreams</i>

707
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:33,089
<i>He'll get you dreaming your dreams</i>

708
00:44:46,548 --> 00:44:49,517
<i>This here's a lullaby song</i>

709
00:44:49,618 --> 00:44:53,384
<i>It's a melody for a little kid
To go to sleep on</i>

710
00:44:53,488 --> 00:44:56,651
<i>I never sang a lullaby in my life</i>

711
00:44:56,825 --> 00:45:00,124
<i>And I'm making it up as I go on</i>

712
00:45:00,295 --> 00:45:07,133
<i>If you have a bad dream tonight
You only gotta call my name</i>

713
00:45:07,469 --> 00:45:10,529
<i>I'll come running
Just as fast as I can</i>

714
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:14,302
<i>And I'm a whole lot tougher
Than any of them</i>

715
00:45:14,409 --> 00:45:17,378
<i>In the morning when you wake up</i>

716
00:45:17,479 --> 00:45:20,778
<i>Just look around and you'll see me</i>

717
00:45:20,882 --> 00:45:24,340
<i>If you want to get up
Just wake me up</i>

718
00:45:24,552 --> 00:45:28,283
<i>And I'll be as happy as I can be</i>

719
00:45:28,456 --> 00:45:31,357
<i>This here's a lullaby</i>

720
00:45:31,459 --> 00:45:34,292
<i>It's a song to go to sleep by</i>

721
00:45:35,263 --> 00:45:41,691
<i>Close your eyes while my friend
And I here sing you a lullaby</i>

722
00:45:41,803 --> 00:45:45,500
<i>I'll sing you a lullaby</i>

723
00:45:54,783 --> 00:45:57,684
I think she's asleep.

724
00:45:57,919 --> 00:45:59,648
Look at this.

725
00:46:00,655 --> 00:46:03,715
They came off.
I guess we did it. We're free.

726
00:46:04,259 --> 00:46:06,352
You're right.

727
00:46:07,429 --> 00:46:09,454
Thanks for bringing me with ya, Kid!

728
00:46:09,564 --> 00:46:11,862
I couldn't have done it without you.

729
00:46:14,502 --> 00:46:17,903
Well, I guess I'm gonna
be gettin' out of here, now.

730
00:46:18,973 --> 00:46:20,941
- What?!
- I don't want to wake her.

731
00:46:21,042 --> 00:46:24,034
- I'll just get going.
- Well, you can't leave her with me.

732
00:46:24,145 --> 00:46:27,410
I can't take her with me.
My job was to rescue her.

733
00:46:27,515 --> 00:46:29,483
Beyond that, she's on her own.

734
00:46:29,584 --> 00:46:32,246
Besides, I was just trying
to help you get your freedom.

735
00:46:32,353 --> 00:46:33,718
You were trying
to get your own freedom,

736
00:46:33,822 --> 00:46:35,619
and you hijacked me
into helping you!

737
00:46:35,724 --> 00:46:38,625
I appreciate what you did.

738
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:43,857
All right.

739
00:46:44,666 --> 00:46:46,896
I'll figure something out.

740
00:46:47,001 --> 00:46:48,901
- Where you headed?
- Mars.

741
00:46:49,003 --> 00:46:50,527
I'm going to Mars!

742
00:46:50,638 --> 00:46:53,266
Different Mars.

743
00:46:58,747 --> 00:47:01,443
I want to do that!

744
00:47:03,885 --> 00:47:06,410
I'll show you later.

745
00:47:06,955 --> 00:47:09,423
You take care, Quasar Kid.

746
00:47:09,524 --> 00:47:12,391
You do the same, Stingray Sam.

747
00:47:13,261 --> 00:47:15,161
Shut your eyes, little girl.

748
00:47:22,937 --> 00:47:26,930
Oh, dang, Stingray!
What the hell did you do in here?

749
00:47:28,343 --> 00:47:31,278
You take care, Quasar Kid.

750
00:47:42,924 --> 00:47:44,653
You take care.

751
00:47:54,369 --> 00:47:57,338
So, what do you think of The Kid?

752
00:47:57,939 --> 00:48:02,376
He was a little bit nice
and a little bit mean.

753
00:48:02,477 --> 00:48:05,969
Wow, girl, I think you hit the nail
right on the head with that one.

754
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,674
The Kid is a little bit nice
and a little bit mean.

755
00:48:08,783 --> 00:48:10,375
You're okay.

756
00:48:10,485 --> 00:48:13,249
Tell you what, now I'm gonna show
you that handshake, but it's a secret,

757
00:48:13,354 --> 00:48:14,878
so you can't tell anyone, all right?

758
00:48:14,989 --> 00:48:16,616
Put up your thumb.

759
00:48:16,724 --> 00:48:18,316
Now stick out your pinkie.

760
00:48:18,426 --> 00:48:21,395
Now hold your hand flat like that.

761
00:48:21,496 --> 00:48:22,827
High five!

762
00:48:22,931 --> 00:48:24,091
To the side.

763
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:26,258
Down low.
Too slow!

764
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:28,460
Too slow.
All right, let's try it again.

765
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:31,198
In ancient China,
a saintly character

766
00:48:31,306 --> 00:48:35,766
was believed to have
watched over "the vulnerable ones."

767
00:48:35,877 --> 00:48:38,641
The three groups considered
for this classification

768
00:48:38,746 --> 00:48:43,342
were travelers, soldiers,
and mothers with children.

769
00:48:43,451 --> 00:48:46,614
Now, with his debt to society paid,

770
00:48:46,721 --> 00:48:50,418
Stingray Sam
began his new life as a free man

771
00:48:50,525 --> 00:48:53,392
under the weight
of an unforeseen obligation

772
00:48:53,494 --> 00:48:55,394
that had placed him in all three

773
00:48:55,496 --> 00:48:59,796
of the ancient Chinese
categories of vulnerability.

774
00:48:59,901 --> 00:49:03,496
Watch over him now,
O Saints of Ancient China!

775
00:49:03,605 --> 00:49:07,268
And you watch, too, on our next
and final episode of...

776
00:49:07,375 --> 00:49:11,243
<i>...Stingray Sam!</i>

777
00:49:31,265 --> 00:49:34,996
Liberty Chew Chewing Tobacco
presents...

778
00:49:37,905 --> 00:49:42,069
<i>Stingray Sam is not a hero</i>

779
00:49:42,176 --> 00:49:45,805
<i>But he does do the things
That folks don't do</i>

780
00:49:45,913 --> 00:49:47,278
<i>That need to be done</i>

781
00:49:47,381 --> 00:49:50,942
<i>He's got a bravery inside</i>

782
00:49:52,753 --> 00:49:58,020
<i>That won't let him run away
Will not let him run</i>

783
00:50:03,063 --> 00:50:05,896
In our last episode,
a small child was rescued

784
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,265
and then left
in the custody of Stingray Sam.

785
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:12,771
Given no other choice,
Stingray has resigned himself

786
00:50:12,873 --> 00:50:16,309
to deliver the child
to her long lost father.

787
00:50:16,443 --> 00:50:18,206
Many days have come and gone

788
00:50:18,312 --> 00:50:22,112
since the union
of this unlikely duo was forged.

789
00:50:22,216 --> 00:50:25,151
Now, at the final stage
of their journey,

790
00:50:25,252 --> 00:50:29,416
Stingray's freedom draws nearer
as a father-and-daughter reunion

791
00:50:29,523 --> 00:50:32,151
will soon be at hand.

792
00:50:43,137 --> 00:50:46,106
Okay, girl,
we got a long way to go today.

793
00:50:46,206 --> 00:50:47,798
Why don't you go get
that toothbrush I gave you,

794
00:50:47,908 --> 00:50:48,840
and we'll put it in your bag?

795
00:50:48,942 --> 00:50:51,638
Oh, oh, I just need to do this.

796
00:50:51,745 --> 00:50:53,042
Don't you want to go
see your daddy?

797
00:50:53,147 --> 00:50:55,775
I just need to do this song
one more time.

798
00:50:55,883 --> 00:50:58,044
Well, it's getting late.

799
00:50:58,152 --> 00:51:00,950
I just need to do it once.

800
00:51:02,189 --> 00:51:03,850
Okay.

801
00:51:05,025 --> 00:51:06,492
Just one more time.

802
00:51:06,593 --> 00:51:08,959
I'd like to do that, too.

803
00:51:11,398 --> 00:51:15,164
<i>Shummumumum mumum mumum
I'm your peg-legged father</i>

804
00:51:15,269 --> 00:51:19,000
<i>Shummumumum mumum mumum
You're my darling daughter</i>

805
00:51:19,106 --> 00:51:20,937
<i>You're my darling daughter</i>

806
00:51:21,041 --> 00:51:22,872
<i>I'm your peg-legged father</i>

807
00:51:22,976 --> 00:51:26,434
<i>What has become
Of your cold-hearted mother?</i>

808
00:51:26,547 --> 00:51:28,515
<i>Shummumumum mumum mumum</i>

809
00:51:28,615 --> 00:51:30,310
<i>I'm the man who raised you</i>

810
00:51:30,417 --> 00:51:32,180
<i>Shummumumum mumum mumum</i>

811
00:51:32,286 --> 00:51:34,015
<i>Her absence never fazed you</i>

812
00:51:34,121 --> 00:51:35,986
<i>Her absence never fazed you</i>

813
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:37,717
<i>I'm the man who raised you</i>

814
00:51:37,825 --> 00:51:39,486
<i>Your mother tried to kill us both</i>

815
00:51:39,593 --> 00:51:41,527
<i>But her bullet only grazed you</i>

816
00:51:41,628 --> 00:51:43,459
<i>Shummumumum mumum mumum</i>

817
00:51:43,564 --> 00:51:45,327
<i>Her second bullet got me</i>

818
00:51:45,432 --> 00:51:47,024
<i>Shummumumum mumum mumum</i>

819
00:51:47,134 --> 00:51:48,863
<i>Your wicked mother shot me</i>

820
00:51:48,969 --> 00:51:50,903
<i>Your wicked mother shot me</i>

821
00:51:51,004 --> 00:51:52,733
<i>Her second bullet got me</i>

822
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:56,537
<i>A weaker man would have fallen
To the ground, but not me</i>

823
00:51:56,643 --> 00:51:58,201
<i>Shummumumum mumum mumum</i>

824
00:51:58,312 --> 00:52:00,143
<i>She got me in the leg</i>

825
00:52:00,247 --> 00:52:02,078
<i>Shummumumum mumum mumum</i>

826
00:52:02,182 --> 00:52:03,843
<i>That's how I got the peg</i>

827
00:52:03,951 --> 00:52:05,782
<i>That's how I got the peg</i>

828
00:52:05,886 --> 00:52:07,547
<i>She shot me in the leg</i>

829
00:52:07,654 --> 00:52:09,212
<i>I grabbed her by the neck</i>

830
00:52:09,323 --> 00:52:11,416
<i>And pushed her down
And made her beg</i>

831
00:52:11,525 --> 00:52:13,288
<i>Shummumumum mumum mumum</i>

832
00:52:13,394 --> 00:52:15,225
<i>I heard your mother curse me</i>

833
00:52:15,329 --> 00:52:17,024
<i>Shummumumum mumum mumum</i>

834
00:52:17,131 --> 00:52:18,894
<i>But the bleeding made me thirsty</i>

835
00:52:18,999 --> 00:52:20,523
<i>I heard your mother curse me</i>

836
00:52:20,634 --> 00:52:22,693
<i>But the bleeding made me thirsty</i>

837
00:52:22,803 --> 00:52:25,101
<i>That's why I let go
Of your mother's neck</i>

838
00:52:25,205 --> 00:52:26,502
<i>And showed her mercy</i>

839
00:52:26,607 --> 00:52:28,268
<i>Shummumumum mumum mumum</i>

840
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:30,172
<i>She up and ran away</i>

841
00:52:30,277 --> 00:52:32,074
<i>Shummumumum mumum mumum</i>

842
00:52:32,179 --> 00:52:33,874
<i>A year ago today</i>

843
00:52:33,981 --> 00:52:35,846
<i>Her letter came today</i>

844
00:52:35,949 --> 00:52:37,849
<i>Her letter came today</i>

845
00:52:37,951 --> 00:52:42,388
<i>What did it say?
Oh, what did it say?</i>

846
00:52:44,024 --> 00:52:48,085
<i>What did it say?</i>

847
00:52:48,195 --> 00:52:52,291
<i>What did the letter say?</i>

848
00:52:52,399 --> 00:52:56,995
<i>What did it say?
What did it say?</i>

849
00:53:02,342 --> 00:53:05,937
It said it's time
for me to take you home.

850
00:53:08,615 --> 00:53:10,583
Okay, let's go.

851
00:53:21,195 --> 00:53:23,390
Hold it right there...

852
00:53:23,497 --> 00:53:25,431
...Matey!

853
00:53:25,532 --> 00:53:28,695
The little girl is coming with me.

854
00:53:30,103 --> 00:53:33,971
- Or what?
- Or you die.

855
00:53:34,074 --> 00:53:35,632
She dies.

856
00:53:35,742 --> 00:53:38,575
Everybody but me dies.

857
00:53:38,679 --> 00:53:41,546
Basically, everyone
on that side of my gun.

858
00:53:41,715 --> 00:53:44,149
- I'm taking her back to her father.
- She doesn't have a father.

859
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:46,548
Her father ran away
and left her with me.

860
00:53:47,754 --> 00:53:49,312
That's not what really happened.

861
00:53:49,423 --> 00:53:52,483
I don't care what really happened.

862
00:53:52,593 --> 00:53:55,528
The girl stays with me.
She's mine.

863
00:53:55,629 --> 00:53:58,063
Nobody runs away from Fredward!
Nobody!

864
00:53:58,165 --> 00:54:00,065
Not the girl, not her father,

865
00:54:00,167 --> 00:54:04,331
and especially not that guy
who danced at my party a week ago.

866
00:54:04,438 --> 00:54:07,236
Where is he anyway? I thought
he'd be around here somewhere.

867
00:54:08,008 --> 00:54:08,838
I don't know.

868
00:54:08,942 --> 00:54:12,605
So you haven't anything
to bargain with, then, have you?

869
00:54:12,713 --> 00:54:14,943
So, send the girl over here

870
00:54:15,048 --> 00:54:18,506
and prepare
to have your face blasted off.

871
00:54:20,454 --> 00:54:22,081
Little girl,

872
00:54:22,189 --> 00:54:24,919
you better get on the other side
of that gun and shut your eyes.

873
00:54:25,025 --> 00:54:27,323
No, Stingray!

874
00:54:27,427 --> 00:54:29,418
I said, "Git!"

875
00:54:33,166 --> 00:54:36,033
Close your eyes, little girl.

876
00:54:36,136 --> 00:54:38,366
I know I'm gonna close mine.

877
00:54:41,508 --> 00:54:43,271
Stingray!

878
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:46,370
Oh, no!
What happened to me?

879
00:54:46,613 --> 00:54:50,709
What's that smell?!
Hey, it stinks in here!

880
00:54:50,817 --> 00:54:52,409
Let me out of here!

881
00:54:52,519 --> 00:54:55,010
Get me out of this thing!
You can't do this to me!

882
00:54:55,122 --> 00:54:59,422
- I have protection!
- You're not protected here, pal.

883
00:54:59,593 --> 00:55:03,529
- I thought you were going to Mars!
- I thought this was Mars.

884
00:55:04,131 --> 00:55:05,689
Different Mars, I guess.

885
00:55:05,799 --> 00:55:07,494
You've been a naughty boy,
Fredward.

886
00:55:07,601 --> 00:55:10,297
It's time you start
paying your debt to society.

887
00:55:10,404 --> 00:55:12,531
By the powers vested in me
by the leading members

888
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:14,766
of the Inter-Galactic Community,

889
00:55:14,875 --> 00:55:17,537
it's my duty
to inform you of your rights.

890
00:55:18,178 --> 00:55:19,406
He can't hear me.

891
00:55:19,513 --> 00:55:22,311
Well, Quasar Kid,
first you hijack me

892
00:55:22,416 --> 00:55:26,216
into paying off my debt to society,
and now you've captured Fredward.

893
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,446
If I didn't know any better,

894
00:55:27,554 --> 00:55:30,079
I'd say you became a bounty hunter
while I was away.

895
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:32,420
Well, we all can't be lounge singers.

896
00:55:33,093 --> 00:55:36,119
That's the truth, Quasar Kid.

897
00:55:36,229 --> 00:55:37,491
You take care of yourself.

898
00:55:37,598 --> 00:55:40,999
- I'm taking your ship, Stingray.
- I know you are, Kid.

899
00:55:42,703 --> 00:55:45,536
I know you are.

900
00:56:57,778 --> 00:56:59,746
There's your daddy's house.

901
00:56:59,846 --> 00:57:03,247
I guess that's where you're
gonna be staying from now on.

902
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:04,578
It looks nice.

903
00:57:04,685 --> 00:57:08,212
Stingray, will you stay
with me and Daddy?

904
00:57:08,321 --> 00:57:10,448
Nah. You two got a lot
of catching up to do.

905
00:57:10,557 --> 00:57:13,526
- I gotta get back to work.
- Why?

906
00:57:14,294 --> 00:57:18,196
Well, because I'm a lounge singer,
and a lounge singer's gotta sing.

907
00:57:18,298 --> 00:57:21,324
He's gotta be there every night
to make sure folks get sung to.

908
00:57:22,436 --> 00:57:24,597
I know that might not
mean a lot to some people,

909
00:57:24,705 --> 00:57:26,400
but it means a lot to me
and a lot of people

910
00:57:26,506 --> 00:57:28,064
who come to see a lounge singer,
and that's me.

911
00:57:28,175 --> 00:57:30,336
But I want to stay with you.

912
00:57:33,714 --> 00:57:36,274
- You do?
- Yeah.

913
00:57:38,852 --> 00:57:41,320
Well, I'll tell you what.

914
00:57:41,421 --> 00:57:43,321
I know your daddy misses you,

915
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:45,618
but you and your daddy haven't
seen each other for a long time

916
00:57:45,726 --> 00:57:48,786
and you can't always tell how things
are gonna go between two folks.

917
00:57:48,895 --> 00:57:50,760
So if things aren't working out,

918
00:57:50,864 --> 00:57:53,799
and you need someone to come
and get you, you just give me a...

919
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:56,232
Daddy!
