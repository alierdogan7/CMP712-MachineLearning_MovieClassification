1
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,830
What are we going to do, guys?
Stand here all day?

2
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,754
- What's the matter?
- Wait a minute! What's wrong?

3
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,156
Your coffee can
is blocking the road...

4
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,668
... and we can't proceed!

5
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,275
- Talk better, buddy!
- Talk better!

6
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,511
You are in the mood for talk
and É'm in a hurry!

7
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,472
Get your things
out of the way!

8
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,631
Wait a second!
Ask us politely...

9
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,717
"May l pass because
l cannot... "

10
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,712
- Hey!
- Take it easy!

11
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,038
- Mind the store!
- Get lost!

12
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,273
Go on!

13
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,117
Shame on you!

14
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,234
Get off, if you're a man!
Get off and É'll tie you into a knot!

15
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,958
Right in your eyes!

16
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,758
- Shall É do it, too?
- É wonder at your delay!

17
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,560
Yes! Wait!

18
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,550
Stop!

19
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,594
Clear the road!

20
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,550
Get out of here!

21
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,797
Hold it!

22
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,555
Let us through!

23
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,035
Go away!

24
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,631
All right!
Ét's no big deal!

25
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,277
Let's go!

26
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,436
What's this fuss!

27
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,598
Let's go! That's
not the place for a barrel organ!

28
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,117
That's the place for a traffic
policeman to start his moves.

29
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,630
Where should we stand?
At a pedestrian crossing?

30
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,836
We'll go where wheels
will never get us.

31
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,155
Let's go!

32
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,518
Look at that! A barrel organ!

33
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,478
- É haven't heard one in years!
- True. They're lost now.

34
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,354
Who knows how
this one was left!

35
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,637
Do me a favour and move over.
We have a sick person here.

36
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,116
All right, sir.
We've stopped.

37
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,231
- They stopped them.
- What a pity!

38
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,599
Come here.

39
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,034
Petros! Look at that
five drachma coin!

40
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,038
- The old man?
- Yes!

41
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,678
Pavlos!
Give it a turn!

42
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,679
Well done!

43
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,599
É'm almost bent like a newspaper.
Wait a while.

44
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,032
Ét's quite heavy.

45
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,636
Don't tell me! É've been carrying it
for thirty years, É know it.

46
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,030
This must be what
they call "heavy music"!

47
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,270
- What will you have?
- Nothing. We'll just rest...

48
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,791
- ... and then we'll go!
- Let us sit for a while.

49
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,636
- Have a smoke.
- Is there another one?

50
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,154
I've got two more.

51
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,829
Petros... Athens is
kicking us out, brother!

52
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,311
It's like it's telling us
loud and clear.

53
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,559
"Dudes", it's saying,
"pack your minor and major keys... "

54
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,713
... "and get out of here".
Right?

55
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,434
- Right!
- We artists are not appreciated...

56
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,792
... like we used to be
some time ago.

57
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,588
- Our work...
- What work?

58
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,871
- Our scam, you mean!
- Say what?

59
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,116
Yes, our scam!
Because if you tell me...

60
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,476
"Sir, you're a lazy dog
and l've had it with you... "

61
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,996
"you're asking too much
to make money doing nothing... "

62
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,630
... I'll say yes.
But my back is killing me!

63
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,956
I've been carrying it
for six hours!

64
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,477
If I'd decided to carry
furniture on my back...

65
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,711
I'd be making money...

66
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,873
- At least 80 drachmas!
- True, but what can we do?

67
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,997
- Change profession.
- Change profession?

68
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,272
How can I do that?
And what would I do then?

69
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,472
Become a doctor? If I were
20 years old again, I would!

70
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,268
You have all the time
in the world to change professions...

71
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,354
... and do as you like.
But I can do nothing else.

72
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,111
I was born doing this job,
I'll croak doing this job...

73
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,231
- There's nothing that can be done.
- Yes, there is.

74
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,112
- What's that?
- We can take it...

75
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,908
adorn it with
roses and carnations...

76
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,237
violets and daisies,
take it up to the Acropolis...

77
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,199
let it roll towards
Kind Herod's theatre...

78
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,271
... and then see what happens.

79
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,398
What's the poor thing
done to you?

80
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,200
- It's the world that's changed.
- We should change, too!

81
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,199
- Let's see what we'll do!
- I can't do that.

82
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,235
I can't part with it.
For me it's a living thing.

83
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,518
I talk to it, Petros.
Just saying it, makes me shiver.

84
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,236
I talk to it and it talks back.
"Oh, girl", l say...

85
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,875
... "why are you sad today?"

86
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,639
And I get a reply!

87
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,271
- Get out of here!
- Go to hell!

88
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,915
There's no talking to you!

89
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,398
Don't set foot here
or I'll knock you off!

90
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,348
Shame on you!
Being rough with the kids?

91
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,517
- Welcome, Thodoros!
- Take a seat, Thodoros.

92
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,717
- What are you doing here, dudes?
- We're moping.

93
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,390
- There's no work?
- Not even a penny.

94
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,631
- Hush, We got five drachmas.
- Oh, yes!

95
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,031
A "century" coupled with another
"century" gave us five drachmas!

96
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,029
You see, our music moves
very old people only!

97
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,751
Why didn't give a recital
at the old people's home?

98
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,838
- So there's no money?
- Nothing!

99
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,752
- Why are you here?
- What can we do?

100
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,237
Take the barrel organ
on your shoulders...

101
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,991
... and go somewhere else.
There's money in the countryside.

102
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,036
Would you like to make
2, 500 drachmas each?

103
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,828
Go to Platania!

104
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,751
There's a church of the
Holy Mother up there!

105
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,112
And the Holy Mother's miracle
will make us have money?

106
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,234
No! Listen here...
There's a fete in two days.

107
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,599
Even I will take everything
and go there to make money.

108
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,839
If you're there too when all
the nearby villagers will come...

109
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,391
... your barrel organ
will bring lots of money!

110
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,517
How can we go
when we've got no money?

111
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,389
How? On foot!

112
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,148
- My respects.
- Who are you talking too?

113
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,392
To the colleague. If it
weren't for barrel organists...

114
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,070
... tortoises would be the
unhappiest creatures on earth.

115
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,079
- Come on...
- What is it?

116
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,032
Rest it here to take a breath.

117
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,953
Easy...

118
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,673
I'm like a swastika!

119
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,680
I can't stand up straight!

120
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,189
I started out like a man
and I'll end up crooked!

121
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,159
- Take courage.
- Till when?

122
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,868
Till we get to the church.
There might be a miracle.

123
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,997
The Holy Mother might perform
a miracle for us too.

124
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,754
You know something?
It's cool here...

125
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,548
So why don't
we open two nice pits...

126
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,712
- To do what?
- To get inside and die!

127
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,310
Petros, I've told you that
an artist shouldn't get disappointed.

128
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,630
An artist?
What artist is that?

129
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,480
I've had up to here!
As if we're artists!

130
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,957
Just because we turn the
handle and it plays music?

131
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,719
That's what barrel organs do!

132
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,030
If it were a meat cutter,
we'd get minced meat!

133
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,555
- You're not straight!
- I'm not?

134
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,313
- You're hurting us!
- Hurting you?

135
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,075
You're hurting us and we
artists have suffered greatly!

136
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,920
- I mean to say...
- Excuse me, gentlemen...

137
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,232
Could you please tell me...

138
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,075
... is this the road
to Platania?

139
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,312
- Yes, colleague.
- Are you an artist too, sir?

140
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,398
- Yes, sir.
- A fete artist, too?

141
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,473
- Yes, I'm going to the fete.
- You're on the right road.

142
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,591
Thank you. Good night.

143
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,469
- Farewell...
- That's how artists are!

144
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,520
- Poor soul!
- Let's go.

145
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,314
- What are you doing?
- I'll give you a hand.

146
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,152
- Put it down.
- Why?

147
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,913
- Put it down, man!
- Why?

148
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,310
Put it down, before
you drop a kidney...

149
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,152
... and a dog grabs it!

150
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,391
Listen to me! If Pavlos
is going to come undone...

151
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,956
... he'll go in one piece!

152
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,838
Are we going to talk?

153
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,829
Pavlos... the colleague
is eating!

154
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,160
Maestro! Bon appetit!

155
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,114
Something that is certain!

156
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,716
Thank you! Please, join me!

157
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,669
Thank you. We're going
to rest nearby.

158
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,235
We salute art!

159
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,471
Colleagues! My turn to wish you.

160
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,473
- Bon appetit!
- Don't wish for us.

161
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,030
We'd like to have something
left over for dinner!

162
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,272
Yes, that's true.
Goodbye, then!

163
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,670
- Goodbye, maestro!
- Goodbye!

164
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,594
Farewell, maestro!

165
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,992
Poor soul!

166
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,357
- That's an artist!
- Right.

167
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,116
- Pavlos!
- What is it?

168
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,829
- The girls' school is out!
- Say what?

169
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,190
- Look over there!
- Well, well!

170
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,592
Hello, man! Bon appetit!

171
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,751
Hello, handsome!

172
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,559
Petros, they're like locusts!

173
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,715
- Shall I tell your fortune?
- Don't tell me anything!

174
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,597
You have a good heart.
But heart don't understand.

175
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,277
You love everyone
but you can't find love.

176
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,877
You have something on your mind,
something secret.

177
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,759
I'm full of secrets!

178
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,551
- Your heart is burdened.
- Wrong. My back is!

179
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,798
- It's the same thing, friend.
- No, it's not, friend!

180
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,635
- Cross my palm with silver now.
- Now you're done for it!

181
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,354
- What?
- That "silver" thing, l mean.

182
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,558
If I had money, I'd have crossed
the bus collector's palm...

183
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,195
... and I wouldn't be
communicating with nature!

184
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,238
Keep your arm short!

185
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,318
Leave me alone!

186
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,830
Keep your fingers
far from my pockets!

187
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,872
- Give me some money!
- Give me some, handsome.

188
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,630
Come! Pay me and I'll tell you
what troubles you...

189
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,275
... what you're thinking,
what's on your mind.

190
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,476
lI know what's only mind!

191
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,514
- I don't need you to tell me!
- You have money coming to you!

192
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,076
- To me?
- Yes, to you!

193
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,351
- Where is that?
- On the road.

194
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,670
- Do you know the road?
- Pay me and I'll tell you.

195
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,030
And if you know the road
why don't you pick it up?

196
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,788
- It's waiting for you.
- Forget that.

197
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,393
And you put the tomato down!

198
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,835
- There isn't any!
- Then give me a cigarette.

199
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,719
- We don't have any!
- Can I have half a tomato?

200
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,912
Put the tomato down!

201
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,749
- Can I have some bread?
- You're a pain in the neck!

202
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,719
- Here it is!
- What?

203
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,991
- The money!
- Where is it?

204
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,077
- It's the 8 of hearts.
- What's that?

205
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,311
- Pay me and I'll tell you.
- Pay her and she'll tell you.

206
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,876
- Give the money, you meanie!
- Here it is. Give me the change.

207
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,795
Don't be nasty! Give me five
to learn where to find it.

208
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,350
- Are you sure I'll find it?
- Absolutely sure!

209
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,518
Why don't we go together?

210
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,910
And when I find it
I'll give you some.

211
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,236
Don't touch the organ!

212
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,394
- I'm just touching it.
- You're a strange one!

213
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,958
Hands off!

214
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,829
Enough said, girls!
There's nothing here for you.

215
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,396
We're in the same line of work.
We deal in money, too.

216
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,911
All right, you have no money.
Play a song for us to dance!

217
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,191
That's right,
so we can dance!

218
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,193
Dance?
You're very courageous!

219
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,755
- Come on, old man!
- Yes, old man!

220
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,992
- Play a piece!
- How about a belly dance?

221
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,794
- Go on!
- No songs!

222
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,316
Wait a minute!
You want a song, girls?

223
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,909
- Yes! Give us one!
- To dance to?

224
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,196
- Yes! A belly dance!
- All right.

225
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,919
Come here, Petros.

226
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,272
That's right, put it there
so we can see it!

227
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,278
Come on!

228
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:42,112
<i>A carnation behind the ear</i>
<i>and quile in the eye</i>

229
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:49,192
<i>The pocket always empty</i>
<i>but the heart full</i>

230
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:56,153
<i>A carnation behind the ear</i>
<i>who's qoinq to qrab it</i>

231
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:03,238
<i>Your breasts are a tiqht fist</i>
<i>that shred silk</i>

232
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:10,199
<i>Kick your heels, qypsy woman</i>

233
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:17,312
<i>Kick your heels, qypsy woman</i>

234
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,714
<i>A carnation behind the ear</i>
<i>and a headkerchief on the hair</i>

235
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:45,514
<i>Your mouth is cool, </i>
<i>your lips are hot</i>

236
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:52,115
<i>A carnation behind the ear</i>
<i>a ciqarette in the mouth</i>

237
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:58,749
<i>Where's your tent</i>
<i>so I can pick you up</i>

238
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,230
<i>Make a turn, qypsy</i>

239
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:12,233
<i>Make a turn, qypsy</i>

240
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,240
Come on!

241
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,432
Well done, girls!

242
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,914
- Hey! Take us along?
- Can we come up?

243
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,788
Of course!

244
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,152
Come on! Let's go!

245
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,757
- Hey, Pavlos?
- What is it?

246
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,634
Let's ask them
to take us along.

247
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,797
- To climb up there?
- Yes, climb up there.

248
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,234
Let's go!

249
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,917
Friend, why don't
you take us up, too?

250
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,833
- It's at the limit.
- Come on, friend!

251
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,719
Move it!

252
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,116
What can I do, honey?

253
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,877
Maestro... if you were a girl
it would take you.

254
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,872
Let's go, Petros!

255
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,749
- Why don't we sleep a while?
- Why not?

256
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,038
- There's no need to hurry.
- Right. It's just...

257
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,316
- What?
- You know my habit.

258
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,070
I can't sleep if I don't read.
What's there to read?

259
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,715
Shall I give you my certificate
from the army?

260
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,879
I said reading
not studying ancient history.

261
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,190
You're hurting us again,
Mr. Petros.

262
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,793
- Here!
- What?

263
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,477
That's better!

264
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,355
- Look what's happening in the world?
- What is it?

265
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,676
It says, a shipowner's
daughter has disappeared...

266
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,951
... and her father...
Here, read.

267
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,470
I'll read so you can sleep?
You're joking!

268
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,799
Read it. Her father will give
50 thousand to whoever finds her.

269
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,839
"Shipowner's daughter
mysteriously disappears. "

270
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,992
"Fifty thousand drachma reward.
Fears of suicide. "

271
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:18,114
lf I were a shipowner's daughter
I wouldn't runn away from home.

272
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,039
And if I were a shipowner
and you were my daughter...

273
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,919
... I'd pay 100,000
so you wouldn't return.

274
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,958
Sleep, because we have
a long way to go!

275
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,073
Excuse me...
Do you have a light?

276
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,313
- I do. Do you have matches?
- ln my pocket. Wait.

277
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,510
- What's wrong with the shoe?
- Pardon me?

278
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,509
- Your shoe.
- Oh... the heel came off.

279
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,239
Give it to me...

280
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,349
What do you think?
Will be he able to fix it?

281
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,235
We'll see.
Something may be done, missy.

282
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,272
Maestro, another
artistic inclination?

283
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,160
An artist cobbler, that is?

284
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,591
You're lucky the young lady
is present!

285
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,956
Never mind me.
Feel free to talk.

286
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,638
- Am I tiring you?
- No, rest, miss.

287
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,956
I'm used to it.

288
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,675
- Where are you going?
- To Platania.

289
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,798
- Oh, to Platania.
- There's a fete there tomorrow...

290
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,753
- And you're going to...
- Yes, "to".

291
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,474
No one knows what will happen...
And you?

292
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,075
I... I?

293
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,871
Yes, if I may...
What brings you here?

294
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,193
Well... that is...
I'm going that way too.

295
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,274
- To Platania?
- Yes... not exactly...

296
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,950
- But that way...
- And how, if I may?

297
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,589
- Your shoe is ready.
- You fixed it already?

298
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,671
- Of course.
- I don't know how to thank you!

299
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,148
It was nothing.

300
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,269
- Well, miss...
- She's also going this way.

301
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,357
This way?
Shall we?

302
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,431
- Why not?
- Let's go.

303
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,829
Let's go.

304
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,074
Excuse me, miss...

305
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,271
- Please.
- I meant to say, that is...

306
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,358
... what brings a girl like you
to this wilderness?

307
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,039
- What is it?
- A spring? I'll have some water!

308
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,599
Who does she look like?

309
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,748
That's what I've been wondering
all this time, man!

310
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,639
- Oops!
- What is it?

311
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,911
- It's the fifty grand!
- What fifty grand?

312
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,196
It's him! The mysterious one!
The daddy! The daughter!

313
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,515
What is it?

314
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,037
There she is! Miracles do happen!

315
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,789
Oh, Lordy!
It's the 8 of hearts!

316
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,071
- What eight of hearts?
- Money on the road!

317
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,719
The gypsies told me!

318
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,669
<i>The qypsies told me, dear</i>
<i>They told me loud and clear</i>

319
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,037
- An unxpected salvation!
- I should give her money!

320
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,832
- To whom?
- To the gypsy!

321
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,113
Fifty grand drinking water!

322
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,470
That's why she was stiff
when we asked her.

323
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,030
Mother of God, miracle maker!

324
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,599
- Have a care now!
- What?

325
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,395
When she comes, don't ask her
"where do you come from?" and such!

326
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,915
- What are you talking about?
- Don't ask her name, either!

327
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,270
- Of course not!
- The sucker!

328
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,233
And when we find
the first policeman...

329
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,034
... we'll hand her over
and go to collect!

330
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,591
We found a cheque in skirts
along the way!

331
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,319
She's coming... laugh!

332
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,592
Well, missy?
Was that refreshing?

333
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,872
Yes, I was thirsty!
The water was cold, too!

334
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,559
- Well? Shall we?
- Shall we?

335
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,159
Of course, let's go.

336
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,194
And you carry it
all the way?

337
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,113
- How else?
- And it's not tiring?

338
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,557
Miss, if you love the barrel
organ, it doesn't tire you.

339
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,274
And if you don't love it,
it does.

340
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,313
- Do you love it?
- Platonically!

341
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,954
Tell me something, friend.
ls Platania far from here?

342
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,839
- Upper or Lower?
Let's get to Lower first...

343
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,913
- Then we'll see!
- Three hours' walk.

344
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,276
- Only. Thank you!
- Farewell.

345
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,959
Opa!

346
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,792
- It can't be that far.
- The man said so!

347
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,759
Let's ask that one over there.

348
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,637
Tell me something, friend.
How far is it to Platania?

349
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,393
- It's about 6 hours.
- Lower Platania?

350
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,398
- Yes.
- And Upper Platania?

351
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,148
- About eight hours.
- Eight? We were told it's three.

352
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,396
- On the mule.
- Oh, three on the mule!

353
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,079
Hello.

354
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,952
- You heard. Three hours on the mule.
- I heard!

355
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,198
Why did he say on the animal?
Where did he see the animal?

356
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,914
Who was he looking at
when he said it?

357
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,838
Forget the jokes
and let's see what we'll do.

358
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,150
Let's ask those people
to find out exactly how far it.

359
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,833
- No, miss.
- Why?

360
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,792
Because one said three hours,
the other one said six...

361
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,076
... the third will say twelve!

362
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,112
- It's getting dark!
- There's no way...

363
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,078
... we can get to Platania
this evening.

364
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,709
- Did you have to be there tonight?
- No, the fete is tomorrow.

365
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,837
We don't want to stay
out on the road, man!

366
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,997
Where are we going
to spend thenight?

367
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,511
Don't worry, miss!
We'll think of something.

368
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,473
The mattress is a bit stiff,
but it's just for one night.

369
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,156
Don't worry about me.
I'm not going to sleep.

370
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,351
- Why?
- Because.

371
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,029
I'd rather spend
this night sitting here...

372
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,272
Oh, no! Rest for a while.

373
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,393
We'll be on the road
bright and early.

374
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,473
Yes, but that's not enough
to make someone sleep.

375
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,713
Perhaps but I know
I won't be able to sleep tonight.

376
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,600
I may never sleep again!

377
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,310
Or rather, I might
sleep once and for all!

378
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,718
Of course, you don't know
what might be wrong with me.

379
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,598
- How could we know?
- We don't know...

380
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,348
- ... nor do we want to know.
- You might be curious.

381
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,232
- No!
- Not at all!

382
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,120
I mean... you might have thought,
"What's this girl... "

383
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,669
"... doing all alone in the
wilderness at night?" Right?

384
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,273
We, miss Katie...

385
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,070
How do you know my name?

386
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,555
- I didn't say any names?
- You did! You said "Katie"!

387
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,268
- "We, miss Katie", you said!
- l said "Katie"? You're wrong!

388
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,189
No, miss, you misunderstood!
He didn't say "Katie".

389
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,238
You said, "a girl all alone
at night"...

390
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,119
and the maestro here didn't
say "we, miss Katie"...

391
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,749
He said "miss,
although we don't know you... "

392
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,712
... "we're not curious
to know this and that. "

393
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,632
- Is that what you meant?
- Yes, brother!

394
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,353
Besides, the priest says
that in church.

395
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,910
He says "Praise the Lord!"

396
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,678
Why should we care? Right?

397
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,917
Of course!
So you name is Katie?

398
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,713
- Yes...
- Oh!

399
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,349
Come and lie down, miss Katie.

400
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,518
Don't worry about
falling asleep.

401
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,598
We'll lull you to sleep
with the barrel organ.

402
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,431
- This is your bedside table.
- And this rock is the pillow?

403
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,274
- Just don't play pillow fighting.
- Never fear.

404
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,353
- I can't even lift it.
- It's a hard pillow...

405
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,551
... but we'll see if
we can soften it a little.

406
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,116
Try to lie down.

407
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,791
Great!
Are you all comfortable?

408
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,510
- Let's say I am!
- Would you like anything else?

409
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,917
- No, thank you.
- Then... goodnight.

410
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,633
Goodnight.

411
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,675
Didn't you say you'd lull
me to sleep with the barrel organ?

412
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,674
- Right away! Maestro, I want you.
- What is it?

413
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,918
Put that waltz.
And you know now...

414
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,668
- Easy does it!
- Yes...

415
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,793
- Softly.
- Yes...

416
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,198
- Like a lullaby.
- Done!

417
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,590
She's asleep...

418
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:54,510
Man, first time I lull
to sleep fifty grand!

419
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,677
Yes, but you almost
ruined everything...

420
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,876
... with that "miss Katie"
you said earlier.

421
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,395
I'm only human! It slipped!

422
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,716
It slipped, but the 50 grand
nearly slipped from our hands!

423
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,030
Yes, but we fixed it!
Didn't we?

424
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,679
Wasn't I good
with the priest thing?

425
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,916
Praise the Lord...

426
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,837
She won't wake up now.
She's fast asleep!

427
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,835
Shall we go to sleep?

428
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,878
Why not?

429
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,109
Boy, what a windfall!

430
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,188
What's the matter?

431
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,438
I slipped!

432
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,234
- Why don't you get up?
- What for?

433
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,195
I fell here, I'll sleep here.
If you said, get up...

434
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,550
... to lie in bed,
I would accept that.

435
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:02,913
But there's no reason to get up
and lie down elsewhere.

436
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,918
That's right.

437
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,510
Boy, what a windfall!

438
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,790
- What windfall?
- The fifty grand!

439
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,755
Do you know what fify grand is?
Fifty grand is...

440
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,713
... fifty grand!

441
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,752
- Isn't it?
- Yeah!

442
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,629
When we get it,
let's turn it to five drachma coins!

443
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,672
- Five drachma coins?
- Yes!

444
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,879
- What will we do with that?
- We'll count it every evening.

445
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,154
- And we'll pass the time!
- Goodnight!

446
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,556
Bona notte, maestro!

447
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,477
Pavlos!

448
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,514
Pavlos! Wake up!

449
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,229
- What's up?
- Get up!

450
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,034
- What is it? Telegram?
- It's the fifty grand!

451
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,078
- What fifty grand?
- The girl! Eight of hearts!

452
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,713
- So?
- She's run away!

453
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,996
- She's what?
- She's run away!

454
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,874
Why are we sitting here?

455
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,509
- That's why I woke you up!
- All right, easy!

456
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,878
- The barrel organ?
- Forget it!

457
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,071
- The fifty grand is gone!
- Let's go!

458
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,358
- Which way did she go?
- That way!

459
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,354
Where the hell is she?
I can't see her anywhere!

460
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,671
Let's listen!

461
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:58,430
- What are you doing?
- I've seen it in the movies!

462
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,359
That's who lndians
listen to horses.

463
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,755
- Oh! Oh!
- Did you hear anything?

464
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,468
No! An ant got into my ear!

465
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,709
Get out of here!

466
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,078
Where is she?
Vanished into thin air?

467
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,629
Nah! She's on the road
going far away.

468
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,196
No way! We'd see her that way.
She's somewhere around here.

469
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,351
- And we'll lose the organ!
- Why?

470
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,636
We won't find our way back.
We should have used breadcrumbs!

471
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,711
As if we'd get lost!

472
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,831
- How do you explain this?
- What?

473
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,718
- Her flight.
- Who knows?

474
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,235
She may have realised
we know about her.

475
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,199
What was that church stuff?

476
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,311
- You think that's to blame?
- Probably!

477
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,669
Wait!

478
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,830
What do you think?
Shall we use her name?

479
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,479
Why not?

480
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,195
Wait a second... Take a breath.

481
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:18,433
- No shouting! Nice and easy.
- What do you mean?

482
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:25,512
Politely. Watch me.
Miss Katie... miss Katie...

483
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,392
Watch me. Miss Katie...

484
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,228
<i>Miss Katie... </i>

485
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,918
Miss Katie...

486
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,792
- Man! I see her!
- You do?

487
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,871
- Three grand from the fifty!
- Where are they?

488
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,439
- There they are!
- Man!

489
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,671
Let's surround her...

490
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,833
- Let's go!
- Take it easy!

491
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,190
- All right!
- Take it easy!

492
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,594
All right!

493
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,509
Oh!

494
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,188
Long time no see, they say
Right?

495
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,994
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

496
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,033
- Do we want anything, maestro?
- What could we want?

497
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,276
- Do you want anything?
- I want you to stop chasing me!

498
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,755
- We're chasing you?
- Of course you are!

499
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,996
Don't you think I saw
you running to find me...

500
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,759
... like hound dogs?

501
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,117
Maestro looks a little like
a pit bull but don't fear him.

502
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,669
- He doesn't bite.
- If you're not chasing me...

503
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,552
... as you say,
why were you calling me?

504
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,114
- We called?
- What did we say?

505
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,113
"Miss Katie! Miss Katie!"
Or is it the matins...

506
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,789
... and you were chanting?

507
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,839
You misunderstood!
If we were calling your name...

508
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,032
it was simply to see
if you had lost your way...

509
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,510
- Of course!
- I misunderstood, eh?

510
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,313
- Of course!
- Very well!

511
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,999
- I apologise then!
- Don't mention it...

512
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,798
- Thank you for taking care of me.
- It was nothing, you're welcome.

513
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,229
And goodbye!

514
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,356
Why are you following me now?

515
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,312
We're not following you, missy.

516
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,152
- You're not?
- No!

517
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,595
We simply happened
to be going this way...

518
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,472
- Oh, so that's it!
- Of course...

519
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,832
All right. Go your way then
because mine is this way.

520
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,871
What now?

521
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,236
- We didn't...
- You have nothing to say! Right!

522
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,397
Rather all that's left to say
is the truth!

523
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,959
Come on, then!

524
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,270
To make things easier
for you... here you are!

525
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,636
It fell of the pocket
of one of you!

526
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,156
And it helped explain
your taking care of me!

527
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,593
Well? What are you
thinking of doing now?

528
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,035
How you will grab me
and where to turn me in...

529
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,589
... to receive the
thirty pieces of silver!

530
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,314
- Is it thirty now?
- Hush!

531
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,471
Wasn't it fifty?
Let's not go back on that!

532
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,429
Here I am now! Grab me!
Why so hesitant? Are you afraid?

533
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,756
You have nothing
to fear from me.

534
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,837
You're two men and
I'm just a girl!

535
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,359
- Listen, miss...
- What's left to say?

536
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,232
What can we all say?

537
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,038
You won't convince me
no matter what you say.

538
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,832
And nothing I say
will move you.

539
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,918
You don't see me as a person,
but as a money bag!

540
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,037
- You've got it wrong, miss.
- And I'm telling you...

541
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,834
that if you read in the papers
the money would be 100,000...

542
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:42,039
... to deliver my dead body,
you'd have killed me already!

543
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,396
Is that the kind of people
you think we are?

544
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,274
- Yes, that's it...
- I repeat what I said earlier!

545
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,391
- You've got it wrong!
- Yeah, right...

546
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,831
We are poor people
and for us 50 grand...

547
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,918
... is like a magical dream!

548
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,873
But even without the money,
as honest people...

549
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:02,112
to whom fortune brought
a crazy girl...

550
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,555
aren't we obliged
to take her by the ear...

551
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,314
back to her parents
who are mad with worry...

552
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,433
because she's gone? You think
that without the fifty grand...

553
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,750
... we'd say "Let her rot"?

554
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,753
And we'd have left you
all alone in the wilderness...

555
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,389
- ... to be eaten by jackals.
- You've got us wrong, miss.

556
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:19,874
The first thing we want
is your own good.

557
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,798
And you think that
can be found at home!

558
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,996
Where else?
In the glens and dells?

559
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,596
You're wrong! And l'm no
the crazy girl you think l am.

560
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,952
My leaving home
couldn't be helped.

561
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,999
- Why not?
- It couldn't have.

562
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,597
My father is
one of those people...

563
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,871
... who see everything
in life as business.

564
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,038
Ten days ago l was happy.

565
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,072
I loved him and he loved me.

566
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,555
Of course, he wasn't
a shipowner's son.

567
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,235
But he was a good man.
Honest, educated...

568
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,636
and he had worked
his way up to a good post...

569
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,199
... in my father's company.

570
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,591
<i>That eveninq, he had</i>
<i>walked me home. </i>

571
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,836
<i>We hadn't said anythinq. </i>

572
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:01,556
<i>While we were sayinq qoodbye</i>
<i>I don't know how... </i>

573
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,195
<i>We ended up</i>
<i>in each other's arms. </i>

574
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,232
<i>Suddenly... </i>

575
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,192
<i>I lost my nerve, when</i>
<i>in the headliqht qlare... </i>

576
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,795
<i>I recoqnised my father. </i>

577
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,830
- Good evening.
- Mr. Benardis, I'd like...

578
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,793
- To explain...
- Tomorrow, son. Tomorrow.

579
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,673
Come, Katie.

580
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:29,235
We'll talk in the office
tomorrow. Let's go.

581
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,316
<i>He said nothinq at home. </i>

582
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,349
Not a word! The following afternoon
when I knew father would be out...

583
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,871
... I ran to the office to find Dimitris
and learn what they'd talked about.

584
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,714
<i>What happened?</i>

585
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,838
- Mr. Lambrakis?
- He was transferred, miss.

586
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,354
To Patras.

587
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,272
- Transferred?
- Yes.

588
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,433
<i>When I returned home, there was</i>
<i>another unpleasant surprise. </i>

589
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,280
<i>A colleaque of my father's, </i>
<i>another shipowner... </i>

590
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,552
<i>who had often annoyed me</i>
<i>with his persistent flirtations... </i>

591
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,519
<i>that I miqht consider lauqhable, </i>
<i>if I were not disqusted by it. </i>

592
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,236
<i>He complimented me like a fool</i>
<i>and while he was droolinq... </i>

593
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,478
<i>... he kept my hand in his</i>
<i>sweaty, soft palms. </i>

594
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,593
<i>I tried to be as</i>
<i>polite as possible with him. </i>

595
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,956
- Take a seat, Mr. Kordianides.
- Merci.

596
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,232
I waited thirty minutes for you.

597
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,431
I could have waited
half a century!

598
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,638
I don't know if they told you,
but daddy will be late today.

599
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,354
Oh, that's better!
We can talk about us.

600
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,872
- About us? What do you mean?
- Listen, miss Katie...

601
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,915
You must have realised
how I feel about you.

602
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,755
I told your father about
my feelings for you today.

603
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:04,277
And he made me realise
he wouldn't object...

604
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,716
My father may not object...

605
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,633
... but I do!

606
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,916
You do?

607
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,948
"Yes, I do! In a nutshell,
Mr. Kordianides... "

608
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,798
"don't insist... "

609
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,871
... "because you are wasting
your time and your breath. "

610
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,678
- You told him that? Straight?
- Yes.

611
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,911
- What did the dude do?
- What could he do, man?

612
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,549
He put down his head...

613
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,268
... and slunk quietly away. Right?

614
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,714
Right...

615
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,713
But my father is not the
person who gives up easily.

616
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,912
When he's got something on his mind,
he doesn't change his mind!

617
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,634
And, it seems, he was
fond of the idea...

618
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,797
... of me marrying that fool.

619
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,998
At first he was gentle.
"My girl" and all that.

620
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,157
"He's got so many ships!
He's got such a fortune!"

621
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,469
"He's got so much money!"

622
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,996
Then he changed tactics.

623
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,593
"You'll marry him!"
"I won't!"

624
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,239
"You'll marry him!"
"I won't!"

625
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,589
"You will!"

626
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,796
You hear me?
You'll marry him!

627
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,275
You'll marry him
willy nilly!

628
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,114
You're wrong if you think
I'll leave to the clutches...

629
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,073
of fortune hunters! I haven't
worked as hard as I have...

630
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,515
I haven't nearly
drowned in the seas...

631
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,632
so that any given Dimitris
will find it all ready...

632
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,996
... pretending to be cute
and in love!

633
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,431
You're wrong! Dimitris didn't pretend
to be cute or in love!

634
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,114
And I won't allow you
to talk to me like that!

635
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,675
- What was that?
- What you heard!

636
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,149
Oh!

637
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,472
That was it! I left
the house that very night!

638
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,676
But you took it too far!

639
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:33,156
- What do you mean?
- He is your father, after all!

640
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,631
If you push him too far,
he's going to be stubborn!

641
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,794
These things require diplomacy.

642
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,355
If l were you,
I'd do it differently.

643
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,716
- What's that?
- I'd go to his office...

644
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,759
knock on his door,
all polite like...

645
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,713
Yes?

646
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,679
<i>Good morninq, daddy. /</i>

647
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,996
<i>First of all, here's</i>
<i>some flowers... </i>

648
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,629
<i>... that I picked with my</i>
<i>own hands, just for you. /</i>

649
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,916
- Thank you, child!
- </i>And I want you to listen to me. . </i>

650
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,760
<i>... because I've qot</i>
<i>somethinq serious to tell you. </i>

651
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,751
<i>You are my father and</i>
<i>I respect your opinion. </i>

652
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,389
<i>I love and esteem</i>
<i>and respect you... </i>

653
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,240
<i>but, I am a qirl... </i>

654
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:19,318
<i>livinq in society and</i>
<i>as such, I have my preferences... </i>

655
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:22,438
<i>... in matters</i>
<i>of... internal combustion, let's say. </i>

656
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,712
<i>I mean, that the dude</i>
<i>you found is nice and all that... </i>

657
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:29,555
<i>... but I don't like</i>
<i>his looks. </i>

658
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,917
What would the old man
say to me then?

659
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,270
"No, he's goodlooking
and you'll marry him?"

660
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:38,075
And if he did, I'd still
be politely pushy.

661
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,033
And in the end
I'd have got my wish.

662
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,709
You don't know my father,
that's why you're talking like that.

663
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,549
For him, words like heart,
emotion, love are foolish words.

664
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:51,230
There's only one serious word
for him. The word "money".

665
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,717
He esteems people according
to the money they have.

666
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,116
He's divided people
into two categories.

667
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,470
Those who have money
and those who don't.

668
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:02,553
He appreciates the first
and despises the others.

669
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,673
And... why am I telling
you all this?

670
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,708
- Why should you care?
- Tell me something...

671
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,793
What happened
to that young man?

672
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,196
Dimitris? I told you,
he was transferred to Patras.

673
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,869
He hasn't written?
He hasn't sent word?

674
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,276
- Nothing...
- He just vanished?

675
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,909
- Just like that...
- And now, miss Katie...

676
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,754
if I may, let's say
that we are not...

677
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,110
the cannibals you take us for...

678
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:30,079
and let's say we forget
the fifty grand and tell you...

679
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,670
"You may go", what will you do?
Where will you go?

680
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,876
- I don't know...
- What does that mean?

681
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,873
That's not right.
Are you to wander the fields?

682
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,310
- Yes, I will just wander.
- Till when?

683
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,471
Until I find the courage
to stop.

684
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,757
And if we take
you back home, let's say?

685
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,032
Then I'll find that
courage sooner!

686
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:55,909
Stop crying.
Crying doesn't help.

687
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,992
Stop crying
to see what's to be done.

688
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,872
We all know
what's to be done.

689
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,712
You'll turn me in
to the first policeman...

690
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,433
He'll turn me over
to my father.

691
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:06,188
You will collect the
fifty grand and I...

692
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,675
I'll do what I will.

693
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,514
What's left for me to do...

694
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,638
That's not right, missy.

695
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,434
Unfortunately, I don't
have fifty grand.

696
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,314
If I did, I'd say
"Here's the fifty grand... "

697
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,068
... "let me go in peace!"

698
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:25,790
You see, I don't have the money
to buy my freedom.

699
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:29,436
Just a minute, girl!
Isn't that laying it a bit too thick?

700
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,996
Who do you think we are?
Bandits and kidnappers?

701
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,589
We just...
What?

702
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,717
- Policemen...
- Oops!

703
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,157
- This is it!
- Go!

704
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,510
- What?
- Leave, scram!

705
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,830
Go away, dearie!

706
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,399
- Maestro...
- What?

707
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,557
- The eight of hearts...
- What about it?

708
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,956
It's become the joker
and goes wherever it wants!

709
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,834
- Hello, how are you?
- Hello. We're fine.

710
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,274
- Is there water in the well?
- Yes, but there's no bucket...

711
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,033
... no rope either...

712
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,390
- Is there a spring nearby?
- Yes, not far from here.

713
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,398
And further down the road...

714
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,069
- Goodbye, guys.
- Farewell!

715
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,510
- Let's go, Pavlos.
- Let's!

716
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,796
Imagine if a person
crept in...

717
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,310
... stole the barrel organ
and left us speechless!

718
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,914
Look at that!

719
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:57,318
- What are you doing here?
- Where else would I go?

720
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,596
Yes, but we have to leave.

721
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,433
I know.

722
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,353
Where will you go?

723
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:13,029
Can I come with you and
help you carry the organ?

724
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,589
No, no, it's heavy.

725
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:21,555
Too heavy. Nothing to do
with "light music".

726
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,516
Really? Then the stool!

727
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,952
The stool requires
a technique in handling.

728
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,793
What about the timbrel?

729
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,714
Our colleague is working!

730
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,677
I've heard of chamber music.

731
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:48,679
But I'd never heard
of field music!

732
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,678
They are a lively bunch.

733
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,831
Why don't we tag along?

734
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,678
- Let's go, but...
- What?

735
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,559
We don't want anyone to recognise her
and expect to cash in on it.

736
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,871
- I'll say she's my niece.
- And who will buy that?

737
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,509
They'll see how she's dressed,
see the uncle's clothes...

738
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,637
... and start making fun of us!

739
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,148
I can stay here
and wait for you...

740
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,032
... until you finish work.

741
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,351
Let's go! With all they've
drunk by now...

742
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,795
... they don't know even each other.
Let's go and we'll try...

743
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,793
to find you a skirt
and a blouse from the gypsies.

744
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,957
- It'll be camouflage!
- Let's go.

745
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,956
All right!

746
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,433
Well done, maestro!
You're great!

747
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,319
Thank you!

748
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:07,876
And now play zeibekiko
so I can dance!

749
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,798
Sit down now!

750
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,877
- Sit down!
- Leave me alone!

751
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,792
Phew!

752
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,190
Irene! Make sure he
doesn't get the upper hand!

753
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:20,752
Maestro! A zeibekiko!

754
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,794
- Alas I don't know zeibekiko.
- You don't know?

755
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,076
- No.
- What sort of violinist are you then?

756
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,595
You don't play the violin!
You play children's games!

757
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,638
- Aren't I right?
- Let's go! The man doesn't know!

758
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,189
- Leave me alone! I'm dancing!
- Come on!

759
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,119
- I'm dancing!
- Good morning.

760
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,512
You will allow us to play
a zeibekiko for the gentleman...

761
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:45,672
... to give our esteemed
colleague some time to rest.

762
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,235
- How are you, sir?
- Fine. How are you?

763
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,159
- A zeibekiko, then, right?
- Yes, maestro! I could kiss you!

764
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,159
No! This is the maestro!

765
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,756
I'm like the external
broadcasting agency.

766
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,793
A heavy one, right?

767
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,879
Come on now!

768
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,031
Leave me alone!
I'm dancing!

769
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,470
Leave him alone, missus.
Begging your pardon.

770
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:12,234
He's a man, after all.
He'd like to dance.

771
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,391
- The song says so, too.
- What song?

772
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,477
Pay attention.
Maestro?

773
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,758
Oh, maestro!
I could kiss you!

774
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:35,879
<i>Don't act like</i>
<i>a policeman with me</i>

775
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:41,432
<i>Because no matter how much</i>
<i>I love and respect you</i>

776
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:48,708
<i>When I'm havinq fun</i>
<i>I don't want you to control</i>

777
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:54,071

01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:12,949

781
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:18,472
<i>And I'll say</i>
<i>a bit more than I should</i>

782
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,876
Say it like it is, maestro,
so some people can hear!

783
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,954
<i>I'm a man</i>
<i>and I'll do what I like</i>

784
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:30,829
<i>And I'll say</i>
<i>a bit more than I should</i>

785
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,917
<i>I'm so drunk</i>
<i>I can't see beyond my nose</i>

786
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:54,230
<i>But I'm havinq fun</i>

787
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:00,708

You tough guy!

01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:14,516
<i>Submit and</i>

Well done!

808
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,198
Bravo, Manolis! Sit down!

809
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,232
Well done, maestro!
Say, maestro?

810
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:09,432
Write it down so I tell
her three times a day.

811
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:14,077
<i>I'm a man</i>
<i>and I'll do as I like</i>

812
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:17,432
Sit down!
"You'll do as you like!"

813
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,751
Look how much money
I got for you!

814
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,713
This way, you will be able
to collect the fifty grand on your own!

815
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,359
To your good health!
May God be with you!

816
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:29,709
Amen!

817
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,752
- Have something to eat.
- Thank you!

818
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:35,999
- And now you're off to the fete?
- That's how we artists are!

819
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,350
Migrating birds!

820
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,238
- All right, then?
- All right.

821
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:41,635
- It's to be done now.
- Yes, now.

822
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,632
On the way to Platania...

823
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:45,552
... is where the men
have put up camp.

824
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,831
Got it? Blouse, skirt,
headkerchief and purse.

825
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:50,514
Yes, everything. But I'll get
all the girl is wearing.

826
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,318
- Everything.
- The purse, too.

827
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,596
- Yes, that too.
- You'll get the purse, sister!

828
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,711
Do you want anything from me?

829
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,040
- Come on, girls! What's going on?
<i>- Just a minute. /</i>

830
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,351
Make haste!
We've got people waiting!

831
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,437
Goodness, what are they!

832
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,714
The girl is ready. She's coming.
How do I look?

833
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,116
Great! You should
have your picture taken...

834
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:15,351
... and have the negative
framed at once!

835
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,795
- Why the negative?
- You'll be whiter there!

836
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,674
Here I am!

837
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,434
- Look at me!
- You're fine!

838
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:26,036
- It's like the carnival!
- You're fine! Grab the timbrel.

839
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,310
Go on!

840
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,269
- Are you coming?
- I'll be there later.

841
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,311
She's like a gypsy.

842
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,756
It's ever so nice!

843
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,876
lt's so nice!

844
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,668
She gave you everything?

845
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,428
You look like a lady!

846
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:10,438
Step right in! The act
that Ali Khan admired!

847
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,636
Step right in!
The show is about to start!

01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:15,678
It's not a monster! We fished it
off Korea! Step right in, gentlemen!

That's it!

858
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,954
I bid you goodbye,
esteemed colleagues.

859
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,835

- Farewell. Likewise.

860
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:59,112

861
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:11,029
Step right in, sirs!
Let me give you a ticket!

862
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:13,276
The show is just
about to begin!

Test your strength!

That's it! Wow!
What her husband will go through!

869
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,516
One at a time! Don't push
at the cashier's!

870
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,951
One at time! There's room for all!
All will see and applaud!

871
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,993
Step right in, sir!
Ask those who saw it!

872
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,679
Amazing, gentlemen!

873
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:55,399
Is it any good?

874
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:05,879
Handsome, you have
a secret worry.

875
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:10,597
You have a good heart,
but nobody understands it.

876
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,593

I see money on your way.
Here it is! Eight of hearts.

<i>Step riqht up. /</i>

907

908
01:10:58,360 --> 01:10:59,634
- You don't?
- No!

909
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,598
- Then come with me.
- Why should I?

910
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,432
- Come with me!
- No way.

911
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:05,392
Leave me alone!

912
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,950
Look! He's taking her!

913
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:12,192
I don't want to!

914
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,995
- I'll see what's going on!
- Sit down! You'll go nowhere!

915
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,753
- Maestro, we're leaving!
- Why?

916
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,991
- I'll tell you.
- Buddy, play a chasapiko.

917
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,838
No can do.
Five-minute break!

918
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,795
- Leave the girl!
- Quiet!

919
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:58,475
- I'll take you all in!
- What have I done to you?

920
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:01,274
- Have I done anything?
- We want to ask you something!

921
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,158
Why not ask her here?

922
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:06,392
- Do you want to know your fortune?
- Yes, say it!

923
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,358
I'll take you all in!

924
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,909
Take care, mister,
or I'll rip your hair out!

925
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,395
Here it is, man!
I was right!

926
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:14,834
- What does it say?
- What is it?

927
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,071
<i>The inexplicable disappearance</i>
<i>of the shipowner's dauqhter... </i>

928

<i>Mr. Benardis, </i>
<i>is still shrouded in myster... </i>

929
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,879
and so on, and so forth...

930
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:27,510
<i>Police stations all over the land</i>

931
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:30,951
<i>with the full description... </i>

932
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,708
<i>... of the clothes she wore. </i>

933
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:35,393
In other words...

934
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,553
Thank you...

935
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,273
- You were saying...
- That policeman...

936
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:49,637
... did not arrest the gypsy,
but Katie's clothes.

937
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,559
Thank goodness you
weren't wearing them!

938
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,354
- What will they do to her?
- What they'll do?

939
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:58,399
They'll have her
tell them everything.

940
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:02,879
They'll say "come here, you.
Where did you find these clothes?"

941
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,556
We exchanged clothes
with the girl, I told you!

942
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:09,236
You gave her yours
and took hers.

943
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,589
Yes.

944
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:13,471
- Where did this take place?
- At our tents.

945
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:16,598
And the girl is now
dressed as a gypsy.

946
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:17,829
Yes!

947
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:20,076
- All right, it's enough.
- What for?

948
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,276
First, we'll buy Katie
a new dress...

949
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,476
- New camouflage.
- Is that right?

950
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:26,272
- What?
- Spending money on me!

951
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:28,397
I know you don't have
money to spare.

952
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,995
That's why we don't care.

953
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,396
Money counts the moment
you have enough to spare.

954
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:36,274
- Isn't that right, maestro!
- Yep, that's right!

955
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:38,317
- You said "first".
- Say what?

956
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,915
For the dress. You said
"we'll buy Katie a dress first".

957
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,872
- And then?
- Then, we'll split.

958
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,793
- We'll do what?
- Oh, you don't know Greek!

959
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:48,600
We'll split... we'll vamoose...

960
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:51,513
We'll be gone in a jiffy!

961
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:54,310
- You'll tell me everything!
- I have told you everything.

962
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,795
And these barrel organists
are here in Platania?

963
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,514
Yes, in the square.
They're at Pikoulas'.

964
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:05,070
- Paterakis!
- Yes, sir.

965
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,749
Go to the square
outside Pikoulas'!

966
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,958
There are two barrel organists
and a girl in gypsy clothes.

967
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:12,912
- Bring them all here.
- Yes, sir.

968
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,388
Bring everyone here at once!

969
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:19,549
You sit down.

970
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:27,759
Is that Athens?

971
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:35,515
Hello, Athens? This is
Platania police station.

972
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:39,196
Give me the headquarters.
I want Mr. Trampas.

973
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:45,717
Hello? Yes, speaking.

974
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:51,436
Oh, right! And you have
her now? Good...

975
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:55,114
Is it certain the missing
girl is in the area?

976
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:58,159
Good... yes,
keep them all there.

977
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:01,716
All of them! The barrel
organists, too! Yes... no.

978
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,992
I'll be there myself.
Goodbye.

979
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:20,998
Hello? Yes, speaking.

980
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:25,833
How are you, Mr. Trampas?
What was that?

981
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:32,192
What? She's alive then?
Praise the Lord!

982
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,917
- What was that?
- Tomorrow morning...

983
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:36,713
... I'm thinking of going
to Platania personally.

984
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:40,476
Yes, you can come along.

985
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:44,556
Tomorrow morning at nine.
Goodbye.

986
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:47,798
What? In your car.

987
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:51,192
Yes, goodbye.

988
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:55,591
- Yes, they were here.
- How long ago?

989
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:58,872
- Half an hour. Right, Vagelis?
- Half an hour, twenty minutes ago.

990
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:01,594
- Where did they go?
- In that direction.

991
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:03,755
Thank you.

992
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,231
I don't know if it's to your taste,
because, to tell the truth...

993
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:17,277
... I've never dressed
a shipowner's daughter before!

994
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:19,556
- May you do even better!
- Thank you, likewise.

995
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:26,236
- It's very nice, indeed!
- I don't if it's nice or not...

996
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,357
That's it, though!

997
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,431
Find a spot
to change clothes...

998
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:32,398
... because we're leaving
in ten minutes!

999
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:34,990
- Where to?
- Patras!

1000
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,671
- Did he say Patras?
- Yes!

1001
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:39,995
Oh!

1002
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:41,759
Easy... easy...

1003
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,793
- It's too much.
- 250 drachmas is too much?

1004
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,548
- It's too much, man!
- Do you know how far Patras is?

1005
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:57,718
Do you know how many two drachma
coins make 250 drachmas?

1006
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:59,837
How much do you wish to spend?

1007
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,031
Let's not haggle
like rich men...

1008
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:04,430
I'll give you 200 drachmas.
All right?

1009
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,109
All right. I'll get petrol
and we're rolling.

1010
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,316
You know where to find us.
At Tsotras' basement.

1011
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:11,232
- Yes, I know.
- Don't be late.

1012
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:12,549
All right.

1013
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:15,232
How do I look?

1014
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,798
You look great, girl!
I can say nothing more!

1015
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:21,150
It's very nice. Look sharp!
We're leaving in two minutes.

1016
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,954
I'll stand outside
and when the wheels come...

1017
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:26,760
... I'll whistle and you come out.
All right?

1018
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,274
All right...

1019
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,468
- Hey, you!
- Yes, sir... ?

1020
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,432
Have you seen two
barrel organists here?

1021
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:50,591
- Two barrel organists?
- Yes.

1022
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,552
Two barrel organists
with an organ.

1023
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:55,434
Oh... two barrel organists
with an organ.

1024
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:58,274
- There was a girl with them.
- Oh, two barrel organists...

1025
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:00,317
... with an organ and a girl!

1026
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,433
- A girl dressed as a gypsy!
- Oh! Two barrel organists...

1027
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:06,240
... with an organ and a girl
dressed as a gypsy!

1028
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:08,078
- Yes!
- I haven't seen them.

1029
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,311
- Say so, man!
- I'm saying, sir...

1030
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:31,433
Let's go, maestro!

1031
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:00,000
You wait here.
I'll be right back.

1032
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:01,878
- What will you tell him?
- Why should you care?

1033
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:04,350
- What will he tell him?
- He knows what.

1034
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,835
He's good at talking.

1035
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:14,358
Come here, you!
Move it!

1036
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:21,115
- Didn't I say not to come here?
- We haven't been here, officer!

1037
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:23,318
<i>- It's our first time. </i>
<i>- Move it. /</i>

1038
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,113
<i>- Leave this place. /</i>
<i>- It's our first time here. /</i>

1039
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:27,159
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1040
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,717
- Mr. Lambrakis, please?
- Mr. Lambrakis is not here.

1041
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,514
- Where is he?
- He's in hospital.

1042
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:36,911
- In hospital? What for?
- Poisoning.

1043
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:42,190
- What happened?
- That's how the young are.

1044
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:45,040
They easily become enthusiastic
and equally easily disappointed.

1045
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,749
- Which hospital is he in?
- The City hospital.

1046
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:00,990
- Mr. Georgiadis, please?
- ln 43.

1047
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:03,231
- Here it is, No 30.
- May I see him?

1048
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:06,552
Of course! He's perfectly well.
He'll be discharged today.

1049
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,870
He could have been
discharged yesterday.

1050
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:10,957
- May I come in?
- Yes, please.

1051
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,789
That's how it is, Dimitris.
Men...

1052
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,719
I mean, real men
and not half men...

1053
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,956
instead of swallowing
quinine and aspirin...

1054
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:32,470
... strike hard until
they get what they want!

1055
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:35,229
- Who are you?
- Your new father-in-law!

1056
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:36,595
Who?

1057
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,632
Let's see what the owner
of the vehicle will say.

1058
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,632
- Have you sent for him?
- Yes, sir.

1059
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:46,235
You shouldn't worry,
Mr. Benardis.

1060
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:48,272
We're on their trail now.

1061
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,351
It's impossible
to lose them now.

1062
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,039
I don't doubt it, Mr. Trampas.

1063
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:53,918
What I don't understand...

1064
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:56,270
... is what my daughter is doing
with these two punks!

1065
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:58,829
I'm afraid she's not following
them of her own free will.

1066
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:02,311
I fear this is a kidnapping.

1067
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:06,519
- They will ask for ransom!
- I don't think that's right...

1068
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:11,038
All we interrogated, the violinist,
the gypsies, everyone...

1069
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:14,397
confirmed that your daughter...

1070
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:17,359
... seemed rather happy with them.
I don't believe...

1071
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:19,312
And if it's like you said...

1072
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,909
... she'd have run away.
She had plenty of opportunities.

1073
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:23,354
No, no!

1074
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:25,919
Yes?

1075
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:29,712
Come here, you!
Take off your hat!

1076
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:32,435
- To the Major!
- Tell me now...

1077
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:34,830
Where did you take the barrel
organists with the gypsy girl?

1078
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,236
- What gypsy girl?
- Wasn't there...

1079
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,391
... a girl dressed
as a gypsy with them?

1080
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:41,477
There was a girl,
but not a gypsy.

1081
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:45,116
Not a gypsy?
Take a look... is that her?

1082
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:47,673
Yes.

1083
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:50,312
- Where did you take them?
- To Patras.

1084
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:53,672
To Patras? Then I know
where we can find them!

1085
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,996
We must only be on time...

1086
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:20,355
May they live long
and prosper!

1087
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:22,517
- Who?
- They!

1088
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,231
And may we also
get married!

1089
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:33,357
And for us,
may we have a good old age!

1090
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:48,752
You do have many ships!

1091
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:52,516
You can give a little one
to grandchild to play with!

1092
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,396
You're an artist too, man!

1093
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:32,353
An artist is not the one
who plays the violin or the flute.

1094
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,278
The artist is in the heart!

1095
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,596
You're an artist
without an instrument...

1096
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:39,718
... like a minister
without a portfolio!

1097
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,672
You're laying it on
rather thick, maestro!

1098
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:44,349
Shedding a tear
makes me an artist?

1099
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:47,234
Cooks cry all the time
when peeling onions!

1100
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:01,472
Never mind.

1101
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:08,953
4, 327... 4, 328...
4, 329... 4, 330...

1102
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:14,070
- Drop... drop...
- 4, 331... 4, 332...

1103
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:18,069
- Drop... drop...
- 4, 333... 4, 334...

1104
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:22,592
4, 335... 4, 336...

1105
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:25,834
This is music!

1106
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:28,634
4, 337... 4, 338...

1107
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:31,030
- Maestro...
- What is it?

1108
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,077
- Five drachma break.
- What?

1109
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:35,276
- I meant, five minutes!
- Why?

1110
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:38,273
- Time for five-drachma coin therapy!
- I don't understand.

1111
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,437
The five-drachma coin
shower, we discussed?

1112
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:47,956
Oh! Oh, man,
it's so refreshing!

1113
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,476
Oh! Oh!

1114
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:54,196
It's so refreshing, man!

1115
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,349
Poor barrel organ!

1116
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:00,234
Remember when you said
we should throw it away?
