<i>One billion, two million
Twenty-five thousand</i>

<i>Nine hundred and eight</i>

<i>One billion, two million
Twenty-five thousand, nine hundred and...</i>

8
00:00:55,459 --> 00:01:01,568
<i>I'm known as rich King Midas
And when you look at me</i>

9
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:08,008
<i>You'll see a king who knows a thing
About his treasury</i>

10
00:01:08,179 --> 00:01:14,527
<i>I never care for women
I never care for wine</i>

11
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:20,888
<i>But when I count a large amount of money
It's divine</i>

12
00:01:23,059 --> 00:01:25,732
<i>Gold, gold, gold</i>

13
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:29,130
<i>I worship it, I love it</i>

14
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:32,052
<i>Gold, gold, gold</i>

15
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:35,256
<i>I wish I had more of it</i>

16
00:01:35,419 --> 00:01:41,733
<i>My love for shiny gold is such
That I could never have too much</i>

17
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:44,697
<i>I wish that everything I touch</i>

18
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:49,649
<i>Would turn to gold, gold, gold</i>

19
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,531
Who art thou, stranger?

20
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:12,094
A friend. Just call me Goldie.

21
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,688
What do you want? My gold?

22
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:18,852
I want thy paltry gold?

23
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:21,453
Tis but chicken feed to me.

24
00:02:21,619 --> 00:02:22,654
Behold.

25
00:02:32,179 --> 00:02:34,135
The golden touch.

26
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:52,727
My gold, my kingdom,
everything for the golden touch.

27
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,533
Keep thy shirt on, oh, king.

28
00:02:57,699 --> 00:03:01,533
To you, the golden touch
would prove a golden curse.

29
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:07,812
A curse? A curse?
Then curse me with the golden touch.

30
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:11,934
But gold is the snare of the soul.

31
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:14,738
Gold is the root of all evil. Gold is the...

32
00:03:14,899 --> 00:03:19,051
Fiddlesticks. Give me gold, not advice.

33
00:03:21,899 --> 00:03:23,457
So be it.

34
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:27,931
I gave thee advice, now I give thee gold.

35
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:34,175
The golden touch is thine.

36
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:36,250
Toodle-loo.

37
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:43,255
The golden touch is mine.

38
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:50,417
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

39
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:52,217
Nice kitty.

40
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,256
Come here, kitty, kitty.

41
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:56,614
Come to papa.

42
00:03:57,259 --> 00:03:59,375
Come here!

43
00:04:19,219 --> 00:04:22,017
It works, it works.

44
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:27,212
<i>The golden touch, the golden touch
The golden touch, the golden touch</i>

45
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:11,734
Hail, Midas.

46
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:14,288
Thou rascal, thou.

47
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:17,019
Shall we turn the earth to gold?

48
00:05:17,179 --> 00:05:21,695
The rivers, the mountains,
the stars, the moon, the sky.

49
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:25,135
A universe of gold.

50
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:49,776
Gold for the soul,
but food for the stomach.

51
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:43,095
Gold.

52
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:14,411
Gold.

53
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:16,650
Gold.

54
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:25,496
Is the richest king in all the world
to starve to death?

55
00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:32,008
No, no, no!

56
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:52,529
Goldie! Goldie! Goldie!

57
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:09,174
Is this the great man who bellowed,
"Give me gold, not advice"?

58
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:13,735
Goldie, Goldie. Help me, Goldie.

59
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:15,810
Take away this golden curse.

60
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:18,174
Don't let me starve. Take everything.

61
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:22,855
My gold, my kingdom
for a hamburger sandwich.

62
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:26,569
With or without onions?

63
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:30,289
Hamburger, just plain old hamburger.

64
00:08:32,499 --> 00:08:35,218
Now thou art a wise and humble king.

65
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:38,212
I will take back the golden touch

66
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:43,214
in exchange for everything you possess.

67
00:08:43,619 --> 00:08:45,450
Toodle-loo.

68
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:11,130
No, no, no, Goldie. Spare me these.

69
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:25,690
With onions.
