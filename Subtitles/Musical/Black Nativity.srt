209
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,742
not some pickpocket, so
anxious to transgress that...

210
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,864
rather than wait for his
grandparents as instructed...

211
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,100

the first law he could.

212

wallet, I was giving it back.

use and us to Thy service.

And make us ever mindful of the
needs of others for Christ's sake.

Lord Jesus, today we are mindful
of the needs of this youth...

infinite wisdom, has sent to us.

And be he troubled and
in need of guidance...

or simply a belt to hold his
loose-fitting pants up...

251

patience to set him straight.

to come speak at his
church in Atlanta.

So why don't you tell me how
Reverend Cobbs's prized possession

got in your jeans pocket?

459
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,230
He's my grandfather.

460
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,343
He gave it to me.

461
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,822
Reverend Cobbs is your grandfather.

And your grandfather.
And my guess is

466
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,620
Reverend Cobbs would rather...

467

be buried with this
watch clenched in

468
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,942
his cold, dead fist
than give it to you.

469
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,710
But if by some miracle he
ever did pass it on...

470
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,865
you guard it with your
life, you understand?

471
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,866
You pass it on to your children.

472
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,941
You don't hock it
like some crackhead.

473
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,021
Get out of here before
I tell him you was here.

Is it ready?

00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:07,185
Okay. You put that there
and pour it into the crust.

495
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,542
I don't really know
what to call you.

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,064
Oh, well...

she got pregnant, right?

That's why she and
the Rev don't speak?

505
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,341
Because of me?

506
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,742

show us his sweet side.

The Reverend thought
the devil had his name.

Your grandfather is very proud,
in case you hadn't noticed.

514
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:43,279
Being a prominent minister, he
was more than just embarrassed

Don't do anything stupid.

00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,823
We'll stay here till I work it out.

I can't do that.
You don't understand.

Oh, I understand.

The Reverend's putting on his
Christmas show... "Black Nativity".

00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,704
Well, count me out.
I don't do church.

Whatever.

614
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,741
I'm waiting.

615
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,504
Do you have something of mine?

616
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,505
Do you have something
that belongs to me?

617
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,591
Were you going to give it back?

618
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,942

something decent to wear?

623
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,546
Of course, of course. Go, go, go.

624
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,551
I'll see you there!

625
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:14,146
You'll just have to open one of
your Christmas presents early.

626
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,665
Merry Christmas.

627
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,664
Langston, I know you
have a lot on your mind.

628
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,427
And maybe the last thing you want
to do is hear somebody preaching.

629
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,823
But this is a very important
night for your grandfather.

630
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,187
I know it would mean a lot
to him for you to be there.

631
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,785
I got this, Ma.

632
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:18,428
- $100 Knicks win the championship.
- I ain't rollin'.

633
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,110
- Merry Christmas.
- See you tomorrow.

Lunch Money.

636
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,986
Last-minute Christmas
shopping? You're late.

637
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,624
What you said, about buying
more than what's in the store?

638
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,311
All it takes is money.

639
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,231
What if I needed a gun?

640
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,588
Meet me here tonight at ten.

641
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,901
A'ight.

642
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,427
There you are. Where were you?

643
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,199
I was looking all over for you.

644
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,426
We don't want to be late.

645
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,903
I was just taking a walk.

646
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,500
A walk?

647
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,799
Well, since you feel like
stretching your legs,

648
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,346
let's walk to church.
It's not that far.

649
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:22,267
Grandma, what happened to my
father? Is he dead or alive?

650
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,944
Somewhere in between, I expect

651
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,864
The guy at the pawnshop
said he knew him.

652
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,105
Pawnshop? What on earth
were you doing in there?

653
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:36,025
I was getting a present for my mom.

654
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,469
I told the guy I was your grandson
and he said he knew my father.

655
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,783
A lot of shady people
hang around pawnshops...

656
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:46,024
that one in particular.
You stay away from there.

657
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,551
You can't tell me what to do.

658
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:52,465
Listen to me. You're my
grandson and I love you.

659
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:55,067
The Reverend and I would
do anything for you.

660
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,065
And your mother.
All she has to do is ask.

661
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,304
She won't ask. You know she won't.

662
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,461
It's fine. We'll manage.

663
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:18,980
ARETHA: This is it.

664
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,222
This is your granddad's church.

665
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,070
Let's get inside. We're late.

666
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,267

01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:22,021
what I did not to deserve a father.

1066
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:24,943
And you left me for five G's?

1067
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:30,024
I was trying to take care
of you and your mother.

1068
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:33,870
But I was a boy.

1069
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:37,863
Not a man. Or a father.

1070
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:42,862
I got caught up with some
bad people in the streets.

1071
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,904
Had some debts.

1072
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:48,143
Your grandfather gave me money...

1073
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,550
and in return...

1074
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,669
he made me swear to
stay out of your lives.

1075
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:57,903
And I agreed.

1076
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:01,902
You took my father away from me.

1077
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:03,983
I thought she'd come home.

1078
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,744
That was the plan.

1079
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:09,427
The plan was that I would...

1080
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,582
show her Tyson's true colors.

1081
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:15,742
And then she would come back.

1082
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:19,264
But she found out.

1083
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:24,426
And the true colors that she saw...

1084
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:27,105
were mine.

1085
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:31,980
I hope you never know

1086
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:35,999
what it feels like to spend
your whole life regretting...

1087
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,262
one shameful act.

1088
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:41,781
Naima?

1089
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:44,622
Naima. Please.

1090
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:47,786
I want to say, in front of God...

1091
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,944
Naima, in front of this
whole congregation...

1092
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,384
that I'm so sorry.

1093
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:58,782
I'm so sorry for
meddling in your life.

1094
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:01,790
Maybe you were right.

1095
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,145
Maybe she was better
off without me.

1096
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:10,620
But I wasn't better
off without you.

1097
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,827
I had one shot at happiness.

1098
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:19,144
And I messed it up.

1099
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:20,905
Yeah, you messed it up.

1100
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,662
I had your child.

1101
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:29,425
I trusted you.

1102
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:34,824
I trusted all of you.

1103
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,742
- Langston, we're going.
- Where?

1104
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:43,662
- We have no place to go.
- I don't know.

1105
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:46,346
But wherever I'm going,
I'm taking you with me.

1106
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,503
This isn't just about you!

1107
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:53,029
This could be what I've been
waiting for my whole life.

1108
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:55,865
Don't you see?

1109
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:58,430
We're all here.

No.

1118

This is my Christmas miracle.

1119
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,224
It's time to forgive, Ma.

1120
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:45,224
It's time to be redeemed.

1121
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,902
