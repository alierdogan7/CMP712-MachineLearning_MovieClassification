1
00:01:48,253 --> 00:01:49,242
Here we go.

2
00:02:03,813 --> 00:02:06,771
We're supposed to dust those potatoes,
not peel them.

3
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,326
Would you like them mashed?

4
00:02:15,573 --> 00:02:17,450
You did want to miss that barn.

5
00:02:18,053 --> 00:02:19,247
What barn?

6
00:02:29,013 --> 00:02:33,086
What's with the razor-sharp turns?
There's no silver cup at the end of this run.

7
00:02:33,213 --> 00:02:34,885
Trying to save a little gas.

8
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:44,525
Nice scenery around here.

9
00:02:45,093 --> 00:02:47,448
If you've seen one potato,
you've seen them all.

10
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,328
I just spotted a couple of sweet potatoes.

11
00:03:12,173 --> 00:03:15,085
You're a little confused.
Those down there are russets.

12
00:03:15,453 --> 00:03:17,364
Whatever they are, I'll take a bushel.

13
00:03:25,613 --> 00:03:27,888
Chicks. I thought so.

14
00:03:27,973 --> 00:03:31,124
How about the one in the red dress?
Her ankles are a little thick...

15
00:03:31,213 --> 00:03:32,612
but she's more your type.

16
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,642
I don't care if
you wreck your half of the plane...

17
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:41,803
but mine I want to keep. Pull her up.

18
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:44,362
You just don't know a sweet potato
when you see one.

19
00:03:44,453 --> 00:03:47,809
No, but I know a telephone pole
when I see one. Pull her up.

20
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,368
So long, girls.

21
00:04:22,253 --> 00:04:25,051
- All finished up?
- Yep. That's it for this year.

22
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:27,772
Charlie, give us a hand
taking off this duster, will you?

23
00:04:32,653 --> 00:04:34,769
Let's go get the loot.

24
00:04:39,773 --> 00:04:42,970
My offer still holds good
if you boys ever want a steady job.

25
00:04:43,053 --> 00:04:45,442
Thanks. We kind of like working
for ourselves.

26
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:47,091
You got families up in Sherrington?

27
00:04:47,173 --> 00:04:49,323
That I've got to observe,
Mike with a family.

28
00:04:49,413 --> 00:04:50,926
No, sir. It's just home base.

29
00:04:51,013 --> 00:04:53,766
- See you next season.
- By then, we'll have our own airline.

30
00:04:53,853 --> 00:04:56,526
Maybe five or six pilots
working for us, right?

31
00:04:57,133 --> 00:04:59,647
- Thank you, Mr. Farr.
- Bye. Good luck, boys.

32
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:04,451
Before we take off, you want to go
into town and have a beer?

33
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:07,206
- Good. I'll meet you back here in an hour.
- Aren't you coming?

34
00:05:07,293 --> 00:05:09,932
I'd like to, but I can't.
I better take care of the money.

35
00:05:10,013 --> 00:05:11,810
That's okay. I'll take care of the money.

36
00:05:11,893 --> 00:05:13,212
You better let me hang on to it.

37
00:05:13,293 --> 00:05:17,047
'Cause at my Aunt Clara's house
I'd just be worrying myself half to death.

38
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:20,091
- You going to see Aunt Clara again?
- Just to say good-bye.

39
00:05:20,173 --> 00:05:21,652
- Poor old gal.
- Still sick?

40
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:22,802
Terrible.

41
00:05:22,893 --> 00:05:25,248
If it wasn't so contagious,
I'd ask you to come over.

42
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:28,882
You don't have a sick Aunt Clara any more
than you had a sick Uncle George.

43
00:05:28,973 --> 00:05:32,648
All right. But you shouldn't be responsible
for my half of the money.

44
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,212
I won't.

45
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:35,727
It's not fair to you.

46
00:05:36,293 --> 00:05:37,726
You said it.

47
00:05:37,893 --> 00:05:40,282
Don't tell me. It's going right in the kitty.

48
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:43,809
Right. A little matter of unpaid bills
back in Sherrington. Remember?

49
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:46,088
Look. I'll settle for $50.

50
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:48,403
Danny, you've got that gambling gleam
in your eye.

51
00:05:48,493 --> 00:05:50,484
- Where's it gonna be? Charlie's Garage?
- $20.

52
00:05:50,573 --> 00:05:52,848
And after you promised
to give up gambling.

53
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:56,411
It's not really gambling.
It's an investment in our future.

54
00:05:56,493 --> 00:05:58,723
- I'm doing it for you.
- You're doing it for kicks.

55
00:05:58,813 --> 00:06:00,724
You spend your dough on dolls and duds.

56
00:06:00,813 --> 00:06:03,452
- What's that, penance?
- At least I've still got the duds.

57
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:05,012
About the dolls, that's different.

58
00:06:05,093 --> 00:06:06,924
I know, you're making a scalp collection.

59
00:06:07,013 --> 00:06:10,050
- Five measly dollars.
- Okay. Five measly dollars.

60
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:12,442
But the rest goes in the vault.

61
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,244
You know something, Mike? You're right.

62
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,893
Even if I come begging to you
on my hands and knees...

63
00:06:27,973 --> 00:06:30,931
- don't give me that key.
- You can count on it, buddy.

64
00:06:33,453 --> 00:06:35,967
- I'll take a walk around town.
- Happy hunting.

65
00:06:36,053 --> 00:06:38,408
I better hurry before the season closes.

66
00:06:40,973 --> 00:06:43,407
Don't wait for me.
I gotta stow this gear away.

67
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:45,171
- All right.
- See you.

68
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:05,412
Now, let's see.

69
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:08,132
"Ann, Betty, Claudette...

70
00:07:09,613 --> 00:07:10,728
"Dorothy.

71
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:15,212
"3820 Maple Street."

72
00:07:27,373 --> 00:07:30,763
Please, Mike,
I better go make us some iced tea.

73
00:07:30,853 --> 00:07:33,731
Calm down, honey.
You're like a fluttering bird.

74
00:07:35,173 --> 00:07:37,641
Wouldn't you like a glass of iced tea?

75
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:40,452
Sure, but later, Shirley.

76
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:43,486
I'm Dorothy.

77
00:07:45,013 --> 00:07:48,688
To me you'll always be Shirley,
the Greek goddess of beauty.

78
00:07:50,893 --> 00:07:52,929
I thought that was Aphrodite.

79
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:55,691
Could be.

80
00:07:59,973 --> 00:08:02,771
I really ought to go
and see about that iced tea.

81
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:06,971
Honey, you're going to have a seizure
carrying on like this.

82
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,168
I am?

83
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:11,643
Sure, racing that sweet little motor
of yours on a warm day, that's bad.

84
00:08:16,053 --> 00:08:18,692
I really better go and fix that iced tea.

85
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:37,407
Dorothy.

86
00:10:38,893 --> 00:10:41,771
- Mom. Dad.
- Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

87
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:44,403
- Johnson.
- Well?

88
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,286
You're home early.

89
00:10:47,373 --> 00:10:49,489
- I'd say we got home just in time.
- I hope.

90
00:10:49,573 --> 00:10:51,803
We were going to have iced tea.
Care to join us?

91
00:10:51,893 --> 00:10:52,928
Get me my gun, Emma.

92
00:10:53,013 --> 00:10:55,004
If you don't like iced tea, I could get beer.

93
00:10:55,093 --> 00:10:56,731
- I said to get my gun.
- Henry, please.

94
00:10:56,813 --> 00:10:59,168
- Dad, you can't, we were just...
- I'll get it myself.

95
00:10:59,253 --> 00:11:01,403
He has a terrible temper
when he has his gun.

96
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:03,165
You'd better go, young man.

97
00:11:03,253 --> 00:11:06,484
If you think so. That's a coward's way out.
Good-bye, Mom, Shirley.

98
00:11:06,573 --> 00:11:08,564
I'm Dorothy.

99
00:11:13,453 --> 00:11:16,172
- Where'd he go?
- Henry, you mustn't go out there.

100
00:11:17,213 --> 00:11:20,285
- Let go of me. He's getting away.
- You can't shoot him.

101
00:11:21,933 --> 00:11:23,286
What do you mean l...

102
00:11:33,533 --> 00:11:36,730
- I'll see your $10 and raise you $10.
- $20 and $10 better.

103
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:39,927
I'll call.

104
00:11:41,213 --> 00:11:42,487
Three gentlemen.

105
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:45,203
Sorry, pal. All blue.

106
00:11:48,413 --> 00:11:50,324
Up, chum. We're pulling out.

107
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:53,882
- What's the matter?
- I'll tell you later. Let's move.

108
00:11:53,973 --> 00:11:55,292
One second, flyboy.

109
00:11:55,373 --> 00:11:58,445
- Your friend has to settle up first.
- What do you mean, settle up?

110
00:11:58,533 --> 00:12:00,046
I was light in a couple of pots.

111
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:01,486
Yeah, just a little.

112
00:12:01,573 --> 00:12:04,007
Said you'd make good with these IOU's.

113
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:08,207
$700!

114
00:12:08,373 --> 00:12:10,568
It's that darn lowball.
I couldn't get any cards.

115
00:12:10,653 --> 00:12:13,213
You sharks let a guy with only $5 on him...

116
00:12:13,293 --> 00:12:14,806
get into you for $700?

117
00:12:14,893 --> 00:12:18,568
$5? He dropped $400 in cash
before he went on the tab.

118
00:12:19,853 --> 00:12:20,888
You blew our pay.

119
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:24,045
"Mike, don't give me the key
even if I come crawling."

120
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:25,725
You're tensing up.

121
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:29,644
- Come on. Quit stalling.
- You must be kidding. We're busted.

122
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:32,327
- You ain't been busted yet.
- You fellows got enough.

123
00:12:32,453 --> 00:12:33,681
Get them.

124
00:13:23,013 --> 00:13:25,481
Danny. Come on, boy. Get up.

125
00:13:26,213 --> 00:13:28,283
Danny. It's me.

126
00:13:29,253 --> 00:13:30,971
Let's get out of here. Come on.

127
00:13:45,213 --> 00:13:47,602
- Hurry up, will you?
- Yeah, I'm hurrying.

128
00:14:43,253 --> 00:14:45,847
- Home again.
- And broke again.

129
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,963
- Hi, boys.
- Hi, Sheriff Garland.

130
00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:58,489
What tears you away from pinochle?
Couple of desperadoes headed this way?

131
00:14:58,573 --> 00:15:00,689
Nope. Just a couple of deadbeats.

132
00:15:01,093 --> 00:15:02,924
Sure hope you find them.

133
00:15:03,373 --> 00:15:04,692
I just did.

134
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:07,007
Anyone we know?

135
00:15:07,093 --> 00:15:09,766
Had a little phone call
from Clarie about you boys.

136
00:15:10,133 --> 00:15:13,284
In these parts, when a man loses at poker,
he's expected to pay up.

137
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,688
- I mean to. I will.
- You will not. They took you.

138
00:15:15,773 --> 00:15:18,367
There's a difference
between losing and getting swindled.

139
00:15:18,453 --> 00:15:19,522
Maybe.

140
00:15:19,613 --> 00:15:22,252
What about those other debts
you have here in Sherrington?

141
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,652
They add up to almost $1,200.

142
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:25,928
- $1,200?
- We'll pay them off.

143
00:15:26,013 --> 00:15:28,766
We start a seeding job tomorrow
for a lumber company.

144
00:15:28,853 --> 00:15:32,687
You'll have a rough time up there,
dropping seeds without an airplane.

145
00:15:33,013 --> 00:15:35,891
- Translation?
- I'm attaching your plane.

146
00:15:35,973 --> 00:15:38,248
- Come on, Sheriff.
- Without Bessie, we're dead.

147
00:15:38,373 --> 00:15:40,409
You're dead. Hand over the keys.

148
00:15:40,493 --> 00:15:42,404
Taking our plane won't get them
their money.

149
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:43,721
Hold it, fellows.

150
00:15:44,573 --> 00:15:45,847
Pardon me, Sheriff.

151
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:49,249
Now just what do you think you're doing?

152
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,051
I'm giving you my IOU.

153
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:54,091
I'm giving you just two weeks
before she goes up for auction.

154
00:15:54,173 --> 00:15:57,165
If you don't give me the money by then,
it's going, going, gone.

155
00:15:57,253 --> 00:15:58,481
Keys.

156
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:02,169
It's a little too late for that, buddy.

157
00:16:02,493 --> 00:16:04,051
Come on, Mike. Let's get cleaned up.

158
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:05,248
Guess what, Danny?

159
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,085
- He just cleaned us up.
- Yeah.

160
00:16:17,013 --> 00:16:19,766
There's so many things
you could have been.

161
00:16:19,933 --> 00:16:22,242
A drunk, an arsonist, but no.

162
00:16:22,493 --> 00:16:24,882
I'm teamed up
with the last of the red-hot losers.

163
00:16:24,973 --> 00:16:26,042
Wrong.

164
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:29,011
If you averaged out my bets
for the last 10 years, I'm ahead.

165
00:16:29,093 --> 00:16:30,572
Then where's the money?

166
00:16:30,653 --> 00:16:31,881
I've had expenses.

167
00:16:31,973 --> 00:16:33,929
Besides, I'm trying to get us a stake...

168
00:16:34,013 --> 00:16:36,766
so we can expand, be executives.
Start our own airline.

169
00:16:36,853 --> 00:16:40,402
Knock it off. We've been chasing
that rainbow for three years.

170
00:16:56,813 --> 00:17:00,089
How do you like those creeps?
You'd think we were a couple of hobos.

171
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:01,971
Instead of two airline executives.

172
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:05,170
I'm tired of you digging in
with those spurs all the time.

173
00:17:05,813 --> 00:17:08,691
If you can go places faster on your own,
far be it for me...

174
00:17:08,773 --> 00:17:10,684
I don't want to be a rock
on anybody's neck.

175
00:17:10,773 --> 00:17:12,286
Want to break up the partnership?

176
00:17:12,373 --> 00:17:15,285
- I'm not saying I want to.
- You're the guy who brought it up.

177
00:17:15,853 --> 00:17:18,526
Come on. What is all this?
We're supposed to be buddies.

178
00:17:18,613 --> 00:17:19,841
You don't want to bust up?

179
00:17:19,933 --> 00:17:22,925
I don't see much point in it.
Things can't get any worse.

180
00:17:23,053 --> 00:17:24,805
Don't underestimate yourself, buddy.

181
00:17:24,893 --> 00:17:27,726
There you go again needling.
You're always needling.

182
00:17:34,173 --> 00:17:36,528
- Told you our luck would change.
- Where you headed?

183
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:38,171
- Up north.
- Isn't that a gas?

184
00:17:38,253 --> 00:17:39,606
North, just like us.

185
00:17:39,693 --> 00:17:42,890
Do you gentlemen have a match?
Something's happened to our lighter.

186
00:17:42,973 --> 00:17:44,531
- Sure.
- Allow me.

187
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:45,841
By all means.

188
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:48,322
It's only gold plate, honey,
but it is all yours.

189
00:17:48,413 --> 00:17:49,971
Thank you.

190
00:17:52,813 --> 00:17:56,169
- Our luck's changed?
- Maybe we just lost the touch.

191
00:17:56,253 --> 00:17:58,164
And your gold-plated lighter.

192
00:18:13,773 --> 00:18:15,252
Danny, come on.

193
00:18:17,693 --> 00:18:19,490
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning.

194
00:18:19,573 --> 00:18:21,450
- Where are you going?
- Seattle.

195
00:18:21,813 --> 00:18:24,611
Seattle. Fantastic.
That's just where we're headed.

196
00:18:24,693 --> 00:18:26,604
- Great, huh?
- What's so great?

197
00:18:26,733 --> 00:18:29,611
Uncle Walter's taking me
to see a world's fair.

198
00:18:30,093 --> 00:18:32,971
- Good for you, honey.
- The World's Fair. We're saved.

199
00:18:33,053 --> 00:18:34,771
Come on, Mike.

200
00:18:36,013 --> 00:18:38,447
Can I ride in the back with Mr. Mike?

201
00:18:38,973 --> 00:18:40,486
Let's go.

202
00:18:41,613 --> 00:18:43,126
Right down.

203
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:44,927
All right. Up.

204
00:18:46,413 --> 00:18:48,290
There. Be careful.

205
00:18:54,893 --> 00:18:56,531
All set, Mr. Ling.

206
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:11,050
Danny, what's so big with you
and the World's Fair?

207
00:19:11,413 --> 00:19:14,928
Don't you get it?
The World's Fair, Seattle. Vince Bradley.

208
00:19:15,013 --> 00:19:17,049
Let's don't get hung up on that guy again.

209
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:18,486
He's always good for a touch.

210
00:19:18,573 --> 00:19:20,609
Forget it.
He's probably serving time, anyway.

211
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:24,402
No, when they closed his gambling ship,
they only ran him out of town.

212
00:19:24,493 --> 00:19:26,085
If I know Vince, he's back by now.

213
00:19:26,173 --> 00:19:28,812
What we want to do is earn some money,
not get involved...

214
00:19:28,893 --> 00:19:31,248
Okay. Maybe he can put us
on to something.

215
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,085
Yeah, the first train to the big house.

216
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:36,768
- It won't hurt to call him up and say hello.
- You call him up and say hello.

217
00:19:36,853 --> 00:19:40,448
This highway hiking's a bad scene.
I'm going to cork off for a while.

218
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:44,651
Pardon me, Mr. Mike,
do you know how to fix a ukulele?

219
00:19:45,293 --> 00:19:46,965
I'll give it a try.

220
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:49,444
- What's your name?
- Sue-Lin.

221
00:19:49,733 --> 00:19:51,451
Do you play this thing, Sue-Lin?

222
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:54,570
I'm just learning. I got it for my birthday.

223
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:56,770
That's nice. How old are you?

224
00:19:56,973 --> 00:19:59,533
A girl isn't supposed to tell her age.

225
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,366
Not if she doesn't want to.

226
00:20:02,453 --> 00:20:04,762
But I'll tell you. I'm really seven...

227
00:20:05,013 --> 00:20:07,846
except when I go on a bus.
Then I'm only five.

228
00:20:09,493 --> 00:20:11,245
That'll be our secret.

229
00:20:11,693 --> 00:20:13,809
- Now try it.
- I might break it again.

230
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:15,884
I think I used too much thumb.

231
00:20:17,893 --> 00:20:19,042
Could be.

232
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:22,808
I have a real secret.
Promise you won't laugh?

233
00:20:23,573 --> 00:20:24,801
Cross my heart.

234
00:20:25,253 --> 00:20:27,687
- I don't know something.
- You don't?

235
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:31,369
No. And I'm ashamed to tell Uncle Walter.

236
00:20:32,173 --> 00:20:33,925
What is the World's Fair?

237
00:20:34,893 --> 00:20:36,326
Let's see.

238
00:20:36,613 --> 00:20:39,810
First of all, it's a collection of exhibits.

239
00:20:40,013 --> 00:20:41,526
What are exhibits?

240
00:20:43,813 --> 00:20:47,488
They're sort of things
you put on exhibition.

241
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,604
What are exhibition?

242
00:20:50,653 --> 00:20:53,008
I don't seem to be explaining it
very well, do I?

243
00:20:53,093 --> 00:20:54,287
Not so far.

244
00:20:56,493 --> 00:20:57,608
I'll tell you what.

245
00:20:57,693 --> 00:21:00,446
Maybe this will give you an idea
of what it will be like.

246
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:01,568
I think.

247
00:22:30,813 --> 00:22:33,088
Just like you said. Too much thumb.

248
00:22:46,893 --> 00:22:48,770
That, Mr. Mike, what's that?

249
00:22:49,253 --> 00:22:50,925
It's called a monorail, honey.

250
00:22:51,013 --> 00:22:53,811
Sorry, gentlemen. This end of the line.

251
00:22:53,893 --> 00:22:56,726
- Thanks for the ride, Mr. Ling.
- Thank you, Mr. Ling.

252
00:22:57,133 --> 00:22:58,566
Here we go, honey.

253
00:23:06,253 --> 00:23:08,323
Are we going to ride on the monorail?

254
00:23:08,413 --> 00:23:11,723
Soon as I make a phone call
to see if I have any messages.

255
00:23:11,813 --> 00:23:13,963
Good-bye, Mr. Mike, Mr. Danny.

256
00:23:14,053 --> 00:23:16,362
- So long, kid.
- Have fun, honey.

257
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:18,366
Let's put this stuff away.

258
00:23:18,453 --> 00:23:21,172
- I'll take care of the guitar.
- Just don't hock it.

259
00:23:21,253 --> 00:23:22,652
I won't.

260
00:23:35,173 --> 00:23:36,492
All right.

261
00:23:44,973 --> 00:23:47,203
- Let's get to the airport.
- I'll take that, sonny.

262
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:49,568
- Start looking for a job.
- What's the stress?

263
00:23:49,653 --> 00:23:52,770
If we don't start working,
we'll stop eating. That's the stress.

264
00:23:52,853 --> 00:23:56,846
I hate to see you panic like this.
Vince will put us up for a couple of days.

265
00:23:56,933 --> 00:23:59,925
We don't even know if Vince Bradley's
in town, much less where.

266
00:24:00,013 --> 00:24:02,971
- So we ask around.
- Lf we spend a day looking for the guy...

267
00:24:03,053 --> 00:24:05,089
and come up empty,
we'll sleep in the park.

268
00:24:05,173 --> 00:24:06,526
And besides, if we find him...

269
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:08,763
- Mr. Mike.
- Yes.

270
00:24:10,093 --> 00:24:12,561
- What's the matter, honey?
- Big disappointment.

271
00:24:12,653 --> 00:24:15,611
Have to do special job
right away for important customer.

272
00:24:15,693 --> 00:24:19,049
- Cannot take niece to the fair.
- That's too bad.

273
00:24:19,453 --> 00:24:21,808
Don't cry, honey. It will be all right.

274
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,451
Atta girl.

275
00:24:23,613 --> 00:24:26,081
- Why don't you take her?
- Brilliant.

276
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:29,131
- Would you, Mr. Mike?
- I'd like to, but you see, we have to...

277
00:24:29,213 --> 00:24:31,363
- Please.
- It'll be good for you.

278
00:24:31,453 --> 00:24:32,772
You've been tensing up lately.

279
00:24:32,853 --> 00:24:35,890
Danny, you keep forgetting,
we got no folding stuff.

280
00:24:35,973 --> 00:24:38,931
- We're broke. We're strapped.
- Only temporarily.

281
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:41,528
What's the matter? Your feet hurt?

282
00:24:42,253 --> 00:24:46,007
- Where'd you get...
- Calm down. $10 for you. $10 for me.

283
00:24:46,093 --> 00:24:47,890
I've been keeping it for an emergency.

284
00:24:47,973 --> 00:24:52,171
Now can you take me, Mr. Mike?
I have $4 saved from my allowance.

285
00:24:52,253 --> 00:24:54,005
We'll go Dutch treat.

286
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:56,330
Look at the kid.

287
00:24:57,373 --> 00:25:00,604
Mr. Ling, you don't mind if he takes her
to the fair, do you?

288
00:25:00,693 --> 00:25:02,012
I guess it's okay.

289
00:25:02,093 --> 00:25:04,049
As long as you get her back by 8:00.

290
00:25:04,133 --> 00:25:06,693
I'll meet you here myself. 8:00 sharp.

291
00:25:06,773 --> 00:25:09,241
- Big deal.
- Will you, Mr. Mike?

292
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,566
Go ahead.

293
00:25:17,413 --> 00:25:20,803
As I was saying, we better get started
if we're going to see everything.

294
00:25:20,893 --> 00:25:23,691
- So long, gentlemen.
- Have a nice time.

295
00:25:23,853 --> 00:25:26,208
- See you, Mr. Ling.
- Bye, Mr. Danny.

296
00:25:51,173 --> 00:25:53,562
I wish we had a seat that faced the front.

297
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:55,565
I can see fine from here.

298
00:25:57,853 --> 00:26:00,208
Excuse me, miss.
Would you like to have my seat?

299
00:26:00,293 --> 00:26:03,046
- No, thank you. I'd rather stand.
- Good.

300
00:26:08,853 --> 00:26:11,970
There's the Ferris wheel.
Look at it go around.

301
00:26:13,133 --> 00:26:14,282
Amazing.

302
00:26:41,413 --> 00:26:43,802
Golly, I don't know where to begin.

303
00:26:43,973 --> 00:26:45,122
Take your choice.

304
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,370
You haven't seen anything yet.

305
00:27:10,813 --> 00:27:13,566
- We got a lot of looking to do.
- I'm hungry.

306
00:27:14,253 --> 00:27:17,006
- We got a lot of eating to do. Come on.
- Good.

307
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:32,125
The more dimes I have on the table...

308
00:27:32,213 --> 00:27:34,169
the more chance
we have of getting a winner.

309
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:35,732
Play for a dime.

310
00:27:35,813 --> 00:27:38,407
You toss them in, you win,
you pick it out...

311
00:27:38,493 --> 00:27:40,848
any prize you see, any prize you like.

312
00:27:43,613 --> 00:27:46,764
Let's get a big-prize winner.
Who will be the next prize winner?

313
00:27:46,853 --> 00:27:49,287
And the little lady wins a big doggie.

314
00:27:49,493 --> 00:27:51,484
And we have another winner.

315
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,805
They got another winner.

316
00:27:54,893 --> 00:27:56,804
All right. You win, smarty.

317
00:27:58,853 --> 00:28:01,606
- Want me to carry it for you?
- No. I love it.

318
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,129
It's bigger than you are, you know.

319
00:28:23,293 --> 00:28:24,726
That's a dream car.

320
00:28:24,933 --> 00:28:28,687
I'd love to get that for Uncle Walter.

321
00:28:29,373 --> 00:28:32,490
- What, to deliver apples in?
- That's silly.

322
00:28:32,573 --> 00:28:34,052
You're silly.

323
00:28:36,973 --> 00:28:40,886
Seven-course Chinese dinner, 99 cents.
Come on, Mr. Mike.

324
00:28:43,453 --> 00:28:45,569
- I'll have...
- One egg roll, please.

325
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:49,921
Here you are.

326
00:28:51,173 --> 00:28:53,368
- Something for you, sir?
- No, thank you.

327
00:28:53,453 --> 00:28:55,011
- Something for you.
- Thank you.

328
00:28:55,093 --> 00:28:56,162
Come on.

329
00:29:17,693 --> 00:29:19,126
Oh, no.

330
00:29:19,213 --> 00:29:21,363
What's the matter?
Don't you like popcorn?

331
00:29:26,013 --> 00:29:28,481
- Here you are, Sue-Lin.
- Thank you.

332
00:29:49,893 --> 00:29:52,248
I don't feel good, Mr. Mike.

333
00:29:53,773 --> 00:29:54,922
I wonder why.

334
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:01,970
Easy, honey, easy. We'll fix you up.

335
00:30:02,053 --> 00:30:03,611
Good heavens. What's the matter?

336
00:30:03,693 --> 00:30:06,844
- I got stomach ache.
- She went overboard on the groceries.

337
00:30:06,933 --> 00:30:08,002
I'm afraid it's my fault.

338
00:30:08,093 --> 00:30:10,209
That's generally the case.
Are you all right?

339
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:13,484
Sure. My stomach went
through three years in the Army.

340
00:30:14,653 --> 00:30:18,646
- Is that dog yours or the child's?
- I'm just holding it for her, ma'am.

341
00:30:18,853 --> 00:30:21,526
Come along, dear.
This shouldn't take too long.

342
00:30:31,453 --> 00:30:34,126
I've never seen a little girl
eat so much stuff in my life.

343
00:30:34,213 --> 00:30:35,646
Wonder where she puts it all.

344
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:38,770
No wonder she's sick.
I shouldn't let her eat all that junk.

345
00:30:38,853 --> 00:30:40,445
Hot dogs, Cracker Jacks.

346
00:30:40,733 --> 00:30:43,293
"Is that dog yours?"
What a stupid question.

347
00:30:43,373 --> 00:30:44,886
I hope Sue-Lin's all right.

348
00:30:44,973 --> 00:30:47,282
I shouldn't let her eat all that junk anyway.

349
00:30:47,373 --> 00:30:49,682
Popcorn, Cracker Jacks,
and strawberry waffles.

350
00:30:49,773 --> 00:30:52,082
Pardon me. Are you next?

351
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:57,205
No. I was just waiting.

352
00:30:58,653 --> 00:31:00,371
Come to think of it, yes.

353
00:31:01,053 --> 00:31:03,169
What's seems to be the trouble?

354
00:31:05,373 --> 00:31:06,931
It's my eye, ma'am.

355
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,893
- Did you get something in it?
- Yeah. I must have.

356
00:31:09,973 --> 00:31:12,965
- Which eye?
- It's hard to tell. It changes.

357
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:17,045
You see, one minute
there's something in this eye...

358
00:31:17,533 --> 00:31:19,922
and the next minute
there's something in this eye.

359
00:31:20,013 --> 00:31:21,685
It goes back and forth.

360
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:25,689
If you look a little closer,
maybe you can see what I'm talking about.

361
00:31:25,773 --> 00:31:26,922
This way, please.

362
00:31:27,173 --> 00:31:29,209
Would you like to bring your doggie
with you?

363
00:31:29,293 --> 00:31:31,011
I think he'll be all right here.

364
00:31:31,093 --> 00:31:33,129
- Don't run off, Tiger.
- I beg your pardon.

365
00:31:33,213 --> 00:31:35,124
I was just talking to the dog.

366
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:42,530
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

367
00:31:49,413 --> 00:31:51,608
- What's your name?
- Miss Warren.

368
00:31:52,133 --> 00:31:54,010
Do I have to call you Miss Warren?

369
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:58,008
No. If you prefer,
you may call me Nurse Warren.

370
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,448
Thanks.

371
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:15,447
- You see anything?
- Nothing.

372
00:32:15,693 --> 00:32:17,524
Excuse me. I'm getting dizzy.

373
00:32:17,773 --> 00:32:20,412
There is nothing in either eye.

374
00:32:20,493 --> 00:32:23,132
Maybe it's right in the middle
just passing onto my nose.

375
00:32:23,213 --> 00:32:24,532
Going from one eye to the other.

376
00:32:24,613 --> 00:32:26,649
I'm afraid that would be
medically impossible.

377
00:32:26,733 --> 00:32:29,611
You can't tell. Science is making
new discoveries every day.

378
00:32:29,693 --> 00:32:32,924
Yes, and it's too bad they haven't
come up with a wolf repellent.

379
00:32:33,293 --> 00:32:35,090
Okay. I rushed it.

380
00:32:35,773 --> 00:32:38,810
My name is Mike Edwards.
I'd like to start over again.

381
00:32:40,093 --> 00:32:43,722
The only thing
that I want you to start, Mr. Edwards...

382
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:45,002
is out!

383
00:32:45,093 --> 00:32:48,210
I know I have a tendency to press,
but it's a personality flaw.

384
00:32:48,293 --> 00:32:50,045
Basically, I'm not a bad guy.

385
00:32:50,133 --> 00:32:51,851
Do you want me to call a guard?

386
00:32:51,933 --> 00:32:54,606
- I like it better with just the two of us.
- Mr. Mike.

387
00:33:00,413 --> 00:33:03,246
- Hi. How do you feel?
- All better.

388
00:33:03,373 --> 00:33:05,329
- Good.
- Hello.

389
00:33:05,413 --> 00:33:08,325
- Hello.
- The lady had me drink something bubbly.

390
00:33:08,413 --> 00:33:10,927
- And now my stomach ache's all gone.
- Good.

391
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:12,846
Were you sick, too?

392
00:33:15,173 --> 00:33:17,050
No. I just caught something in my eye.

393
00:33:20,053 --> 00:33:22,521
I'm afraid it will be there for a long time.

394
00:33:24,853 --> 00:33:27,128
- Good-bye, Mr. Edwards.
- Good-bye, Miss Warren.

395
00:33:27,413 --> 00:33:29,369
- Mr. Edwards.
- Yes?

396
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:33,847
- You forgot your doggie.
- That's my doggie.

397
00:33:33,933 --> 00:33:35,525
I'm glad you told her.

398
00:33:38,853 --> 00:33:41,003
Come on. We still got lots to see.

399
00:33:43,853 --> 00:33:47,129
- Popcorn, Mr. Mike?
- Are you sure?

400
00:33:48,573 --> 00:33:50,165
Two popcorns.

401
00:36:15,493 --> 00:36:16,812
Mr. Danny.

402
00:36:17,373 --> 00:36:18,772
- Hi, buddy.
- She's sleeping.

403
00:36:18,853 --> 00:36:22,004
I get her right to bed.
Thanks so much, Mr. Edwards.

404
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,043
Not at all, Mr. Ling. In fact, I enjoyed it.

405
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:28,601
I wish good luck. Hope you both find jobs.

406
00:36:28,693 --> 00:36:29,682
Thank you.

407
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:31,889
Tell Sue-Lin when she wakes up
I said good-bye.

408
00:36:31,973 --> 00:36:34,009
- Will tell.
- You do that.

409
00:36:36,173 --> 00:36:38,482
- I have big news, colleague.
- Find us a job?

410
00:36:38,573 --> 00:36:40,848
A job? Don't be so crude.
This is good news.

411
00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:42,286
We'll have to line up something.

412
00:36:42,373 --> 00:36:44,933
Now, patience, patience.
Our relief ship is in.

413
00:36:45,013 --> 00:36:46,890
All we have to do is climb up the gangway.

414
00:36:46,973 --> 00:36:48,452
That's nice.

415
00:36:48,693 --> 00:36:51,810
What's with you, punctured ear drums?
I'm delivering a big message.

416
00:36:51,893 --> 00:36:53,804
Okay, so you found Vince Bradley.

417
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:56,410
Mike, level off. Is something wrong?

418
00:36:56,493 --> 00:36:58,802
No. As a matter of fact I feel kind of good.

419
00:36:58,893 --> 00:37:01,691
In a lousy sort of way.
Come on, what happened?

420
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:05,286
- You'll probably laugh yourself to death.
- Come on.

421
00:37:05,373 --> 00:37:06,931
I ran into this girl today.

422
00:37:07,013 --> 00:37:09,846
Flash! He ran into a girl, today!

423
00:37:09,933 --> 00:37:11,252
Yeah, I know.

424
00:37:11,573 --> 00:37:12,972
But this girl is...

425
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:17,286
I must be flipping my lid.
She's not even my type.

426
00:37:17,373 --> 00:37:18,965
You mean like aloof?

427
00:37:19,053 --> 00:37:20,691
Worse. Chilly. Ice-cold.

428
00:37:21,253 --> 00:37:23,892
They all have to be
room-temperature, right?

429
00:37:23,973 --> 00:37:26,203
Come on, I've got something
I want to show you.

430
00:37:28,093 --> 00:37:30,561
- Regardez.
- Who does it belong to?

431
00:37:30,693 --> 00:37:33,969
- You'll have to see him to believe him.
- Someone you used to know?

432
00:37:34,053 --> 00:37:36,931
Guy named Barney Thatcher.
Met him this afternoon.

433
00:37:37,013 --> 00:37:38,924
What's so special with Mr. Thatcher?

434
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:41,971
He happens to be absolutely,
far and away...

435
00:37:42,053 --> 00:37:44,886
the worst gin-rummy player in the world.
Hop in.

436
00:38:10,653 --> 00:38:11,847
Come on.

437
00:38:15,653 --> 00:38:17,564
Are you nuts or something?

438
00:38:25,493 --> 00:38:27,882
- We'll get thrown...
- Here we have the living room.

439
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:30,328
Follow me, please. Dining room...

440
00:38:30,893 --> 00:38:34,806
kitchen, bedroom, and down the corner,
shall we say the family room.

441
00:38:34,893 --> 00:38:37,851
- Charming, but whose is it?
- It's ours for the next two weeks.

442
00:38:37,933 --> 00:38:39,730
- Pretty posh?
- Details.

443
00:38:40,173 --> 00:38:43,370
I cannot tell a lie.
I did with my little pasteboards.

444
00:38:43,453 --> 00:38:46,570
Gin. Three blitzes and a double in spades!

445
00:38:49,933 --> 00:38:53,972
Get out the cards, Danny boy. I'm ready.
I'll clobber you tonight.

446
00:38:54,053 --> 00:38:55,930
Easy there, buckaroo.

447
00:38:56,013 --> 00:38:58,652
Barney, this is Mike Edwards.
Barney Thatcher, our host.

448
00:38:58,733 --> 00:39:01,088
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hi. Play gin?

449
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:02,242
Not me.

450
00:39:03,213 --> 00:39:04,646
So shuffle the cards.

451
00:39:04,733 --> 00:39:07,088
We haven't parked the car
or brought our bags in yet.

452
00:39:07,173 --> 00:39:09,687
I'll park the car.
I'll bring in the bags. You shuffle.

453
00:39:09,773 --> 00:39:11,047
I'll do that.

454
00:39:11,973 --> 00:39:14,612
Danny, you weren't born. You were dealt.

455
00:39:16,173 --> 00:39:17,526
Where'd you dig him up?

456
00:39:17,613 --> 00:39:20,173
At a bridge club
Vince Bradley used to hang around.

457
00:39:20,293 --> 00:39:21,442
Bridge club?

458
00:39:22,173 --> 00:39:24,687
That's what the guard at the door called it.

459
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:30,051
Excuse me. I'll take it.

460
00:39:30,813 --> 00:39:32,565
Come on, Danny. Deal.

461
00:39:37,013 --> 00:39:38,412
My lucky chair.

462
00:39:42,533 --> 00:39:44,046
What about your wife?

463
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:47,842
Don't worry about her.
She fell asleep in front of the TV. Deal.

464
00:39:48,933 --> 00:39:50,571
Barney!

465
00:39:52,493 --> 00:39:55,007
Those commercials always wake her up.

466
00:39:55,613 --> 00:39:57,365
Come on. Deal a fast one.

467
00:40:02,373 --> 00:40:04,329
Coming, precious!

468
00:40:04,813 --> 00:40:06,405
You miserable...

469
00:40:08,613 --> 00:40:10,843
Sounds like she keeps him
on a pretty tight leash.

470
00:40:10,933 --> 00:40:12,412
He doesn't even get an allowance.

471
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:15,530
All I could win was rent
and use of the station wagon.

472
00:40:15,653 --> 00:40:17,006
You're forgiven.

473
00:40:17,093 --> 00:40:19,527
But we'll have to get a move on
to get a job tomorrow.

474
00:40:19,613 --> 00:40:21,365
In 12 days, Bessie goes on the block.

475
00:40:21,453 --> 00:40:23,205
Don't worry. We'll raise the dough.

476
00:40:27,013 --> 00:40:29,607
She's the kind who might go
for the sympathy bit.

477
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:30,842
Who?

478
00:40:31,213 --> 00:40:33,408
The nurse I met at the fairgrounds today.

479
00:40:34,293 --> 00:40:37,330
Florence Nightingale, servant of humanity,
and all that jazz.

480
00:40:37,413 --> 00:40:39,529
The rabbit hunter rides again.

481
00:40:39,653 --> 00:40:42,645
Some doll gives him the brush,
and right away it's a challenge.

482
00:40:44,173 --> 00:40:48,371
I'll tell her she's keeping me up at nights,
ruining my health, breaking my heart.

483
00:40:48,653 --> 00:40:50,484
She'll probably hand you a pill.

484
00:40:50,893 --> 00:40:52,451
You'd be surprised, Danny.

485
00:40:53,053 --> 00:40:55,647
Some women love to think
they can destroy you.

486
00:40:56,973 --> 00:40:58,167
And do.

487
00:42:52,253 --> 00:42:54,847
Quiet! You'll wake Thelma.

488
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:23,691
It's just unbelievable.

489
00:43:24,133 --> 00:43:25,566
Yeah. I can't figure it.

490
00:43:25,813 --> 00:43:27,804
Not one lousy job opening.

491
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:31,086
Every cloudhopper in the country
must be here for the fair.

492
00:43:31,173 --> 00:43:34,210
I still say Vince Bradley's our best bet.

493
00:43:34,493 --> 00:43:37,610
Why don't you knock it off?
You're sounding like a broken record.

494
00:43:37,693 --> 00:43:40,332
- Vince Bradley, Vince Bradley...
- He never listens to me.

495
00:43:40,413 --> 00:43:42,290
You never listen to me.

496
00:43:42,373 --> 00:43:43,772
I wonder why.

497
00:43:59,413 --> 00:44:02,052
Kid, how would you like
to kick me in the shin?

498
00:44:02,653 --> 00:44:04,962
How would I like to kick you in the shin?

499
00:44:05,053 --> 00:44:07,613
- Mister, are you drunk?
- No kidding. I'll tell you what.

500
00:44:07,693 --> 00:44:10,253
Kick me in the shin real hard,
I'll give you a quarter.

501
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:11,607
Go ahead, play it.

502
00:44:14,733 --> 00:44:16,451
That's a good one, boy.

503
00:44:18,133 --> 00:44:21,045
Adults, they're all nuts.

504
00:44:34,373 --> 00:44:36,443
Nurse, I had an accident.

505
00:44:37,813 --> 00:44:39,087
You again?

506
00:44:39,213 --> 00:44:40,805
I think I broke my leg.

507
00:44:41,133 --> 00:44:44,569
Only a broken leg?
You can do better than that.

508
00:44:44,773 --> 00:44:46,650
How about malaria or hydrophobia?

509
00:44:46,733 --> 00:44:48,769
This is on the level. I'm hurt really.

510
00:44:49,133 --> 00:44:51,601
Miss Warren, why aren't you taking care
of this man?

511
00:44:51,693 --> 00:44:53,524
Because I don't believe he's injured.

512
00:44:53,613 --> 00:44:55,729
You have to take my word for it,
I am injured.

513
00:44:55,813 --> 00:44:59,169
- Let me have a look at it.
- I'd appreciate it, ma'am. Here it is.

514
00:45:04,613 --> 00:45:06,171
Easy, ma'am, easy.

515
00:45:07,253 --> 00:45:10,211
Why, it's a definite skin abrasion,
and it's swelling.

516
00:45:10,973 --> 00:45:14,363
- I'm terribly sorry. I thought...
- That's all right, honey, Miss Warren.

517
00:45:14,453 --> 00:45:16,250
If you give me something for the pain...

518
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:17,607
- it'll be all right.
- Of course.

519
00:45:17,693 --> 00:45:20,048
- Let's take this gentleman inside.
- Yes, ma'am.

520
00:45:20,133 --> 00:45:21,725
Forgive Miss Warren.

521
00:45:21,813 --> 00:45:24,281
Lately her mind seems to be
in outer space.

522
00:45:24,813 --> 00:45:25,882
Yes, ma'am.

523
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:30,531
Sit over there, please.

524
00:45:31,493 --> 00:45:33,927
Miss Warren, would you
take my coat off, please?

525
00:45:38,533 --> 00:45:41,491
Miss Warren, would you help me
on the table, please?

526
00:45:42,293 --> 00:45:43,328
Thank you.

527
00:45:44,373 --> 00:45:45,886
How did this happen?

528
00:45:46,053 --> 00:45:48,772
I tripped on something.
Broken pavement, I think.

529
00:45:48,853 --> 00:45:51,811
- Broken pavement? In the fairgrounds?
- Yes.

530
00:45:51,933 --> 00:45:53,764
Do you remember the exact location?

531
00:45:53,853 --> 00:45:55,764
I sort of blacked out.

532
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:58,526
It'll probably come back to me
when I talk to my lawyer.

533
00:45:59,813 --> 00:46:02,088
- Your lawyer?
- Yeah, he's a wonderful guy.

534
00:46:02,173 --> 00:46:04,971
If you give him a call,
I'm sure he'll be glad to come over.

535
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:07,851
I don't think you need
to bring your lawyer into this.

536
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:11,488
I don't want to cause trouble,
but I think he'll want a statement.

537
00:46:11,773 --> 00:46:14,526
Besides, I don't have any other way
of getting home.

538
00:46:15,093 --> 00:46:17,732
I'm sure we can do something about that.

539
00:46:18,213 --> 00:46:20,807
Miss Warren, you're just
going off duty, aren't you?

540
00:46:20,893 --> 00:46:22,645
- Yes, but...
- I don't want to impose.

541
00:46:22,733 --> 00:46:24,883
If you just phone my lawyer,
it'll be all right.

542
00:46:24,973 --> 00:46:26,565
It's no imposition at all.

543
00:46:26,653 --> 00:46:29,372
Miss Warren will be delighted
to see you safely home.

544
00:46:29,773 --> 00:46:31,968
- Won't you, dear?
- Delighted.

545
00:46:32,973 --> 00:46:36,124
There we are.
By tomorrow, you'll be as good as new.

546
00:46:38,853 --> 00:46:41,492
Whatever you say and my lawyer thinks.

547
00:46:42,293 --> 00:46:44,602
- Here's your coat, Mr. Edwards.
- Thank you.

548
00:46:44,693 --> 00:46:45,808
I'll go and change...

549
00:46:45,893 --> 00:46:48,361
- and meet you in the waiting room.
- That's mighty nice.

550
00:46:48,453 --> 00:46:51,251
Will you just walk
up and down on that, please?

551
00:46:54,693 --> 00:46:57,651
I'm sure that by tomorrow
it will be perfectly all right.

552
00:46:57,733 --> 00:46:59,052
I hope so.

553
00:47:04,453 --> 00:47:05,647
Get in.

554
00:47:30,853 --> 00:47:32,764
Nice of you to take this trouble.

555
00:47:32,853 --> 00:47:33,968
No trouble at all.

556
00:47:34,053 --> 00:47:36,692
It's the least I can do
for the good of the fair.

557
00:47:37,293 --> 00:47:40,251
If you've got a date tonight,
I hope he'll forgive the delay.

558
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:42,767
If I did, he would. But I don't.

559
00:47:43,053 --> 00:47:45,169
- No steady?
- I beg your pardon?

560
00:47:45,653 --> 00:47:48,121
No one particular guy
you go out with all the time?

561
00:47:48,213 --> 00:47:50,727
I hardly see how that concerns you.

562
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:54,371
If I'm gonna go around breaking my legs
on your account...

563
00:47:54,453 --> 00:47:56,921
- I should at least know where I stand.
- On my account?

564
00:47:57,013 --> 00:47:59,322
Sure. The way I've been feeling
since we met...

565
00:47:59,413 --> 00:48:02,928
it's just been blind luck
that I haven't been run over by a bus.

566
00:48:03,253 --> 00:48:06,165
No other girl has ever
affected me that way.

567
00:48:06,813 --> 00:48:09,771
You mean as a rule,
you just treat them as sisters.

568
00:48:10,253 --> 00:48:11,845
I wouldn't go that far...

569
00:48:11,933 --> 00:48:15,323
but up until now when I was alone
up in the blue with Bessie...

570
00:48:15,413 --> 00:48:17,722
I didn't feel the need for anybody else.

571
00:48:17,813 --> 00:48:19,849
- Bessie?
- She's my airplane.

572
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:21,732
You're a flyer.

573
00:48:22,053 --> 00:48:25,250
Yeah. 9,000 hours in the air,
8,000 with a plane.

574
00:48:26,053 --> 00:48:27,645
- Air Force?
- No.

575
00:48:27,853 --> 00:48:29,081
Airline pilot?

576
00:48:29,453 --> 00:48:32,445
No. You could call me
one of the last pioneers.

577
00:48:32,893 --> 00:48:35,805
Just going where the wind blows.
Flying wherever I'm needed.

578
00:48:36,373 --> 00:48:38,011
You're looking for work.

579
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:41,570
We're coming up to the gate.
I'll put you in a cab there.

580
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,607
Stop the cart. It's happening again.

581
00:48:49,213 --> 00:48:52,489
- What's the matter?
- Everything's going black. I feel pale.

582
00:48:52,573 --> 00:48:55,007
Try to calm down. Get a hold of yourself.

583
00:48:55,093 --> 00:48:57,129
Maybe I should've eaten
something yesterday.

584
00:48:57,213 --> 00:48:59,568
Yesterday?
When was the last time you did eat?

585
00:48:59,653 --> 00:49:01,689
It's been days. I need nourishment.

586
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:04,241
Please try to control yourself.

587
00:49:05,133 --> 00:49:07,931
There's a restaurant
up at the top of the Space Needle.

588
00:49:08,013 --> 00:49:10,163
- There is?
- We'll go get you something.

589
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:11,766
Okay, you're the doctor.

590
00:49:11,853 --> 00:49:13,525
- What?
- Nurse.

591
00:49:14,973 --> 00:49:17,726
Just give me these and lean on me.

592
00:49:17,893 --> 00:49:19,042
It's okay.

593
00:49:23,853 --> 00:49:26,162
- Hi, Erna.
- Hi, Diane. Any news?

594
00:49:26,253 --> 00:49:28,847
- Not yet.
- I've got my fingers crossed for you.

595
00:49:28,933 --> 00:49:30,605
- Thank you.
- See you later.

596
00:49:31,293 --> 00:49:33,761
What was that about, Diane?

597
00:49:34,053 --> 00:49:37,250
I've applied for a job in the government's
space medicine program.

598
00:49:37,333 --> 00:49:39,972
That's great.
It must give a girl a wonderful feeling...

599
00:49:40,053 --> 00:49:42,521
to know she can do something useful.

600
00:49:43,373 --> 00:49:45,011
Mr. Edwards, it just may...

601
00:49:46,293 --> 00:49:47,487
My foot.

602
00:49:52,893 --> 00:49:55,407
Hold it, folks. Back of the line.

603
00:49:55,813 --> 00:49:58,281
But his foot is giving him a lot of pain.

604
00:49:59,213 --> 00:50:01,727
- You can go the short way.
- Thank you.

605
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:03,561
Going up.

606
00:50:06,893 --> 00:50:09,327
Sorry. You'll have to wait for the next one.

607
00:50:45,093 --> 00:50:47,084
- Coffee later?
- That will be fine.

608
00:50:47,173 --> 00:50:49,243
- Coffee later, please.
- Thank you.

609
00:50:49,733 --> 00:50:51,724
Isn't Mount Rainier beautiful?

610
00:50:53,893 --> 00:50:55,292
Breathtaking.

611
00:50:56,133 --> 00:50:58,806
Can I help it
if I'm not so large for mountains?

612
00:50:59,813 --> 00:51:01,929
See, there I go, pressing again.

613
00:51:02,533 --> 00:51:05,525
- That's one thing I have to watch.
- Do that, Mr. Edwards.

614
00:51:05,933 --> 00:51:09,562
Mike. I'll try, but it's not so easy
with a girl like you.

615
00:51:09,853 --> 00:51:11,605
What kind of a girl am I?

616
00:51:12,573 --> 00:51:15,371
For one thing, you've got ideals.
You look to the future...

617
00:51:15,453 --> 00:51:17,603
like going into the space program.

618
00:51:18,213 --> 00:51:20,283
Have you seen any of the exhibits here...

619
00:51:20,373 --> 00:51:23,092
like the Spacearium
or the Space Administration display?

620
00:51:23,173 --> 00:51:24,526
Yeah. Fantastic.

621
00:51:24,853 --> 00:51:27,208
They certainly changed my outlook.

622
00:51:27,853 --> 00:51:32,165
All of a sudden, stomach aches
and twisted ankles and broken legs...

623
00:51:32,253 --> 00:51:34,130
just stopped seeming so important.

624
00:51:34,493 --> 00:51:36,882
I guess you can have a tendency
to overrate them.

625
00:51:37,213 --> 00:51:39,090
- Present leg excepted.
- Thank you.

626
00:51:39,813 --> 00:51:41,849
Tell me some more
about the space program.

627
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:44,686
- All right. Are you really a pilot?
- Sure.

628
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:48,010
The program has a lot of jobs
a pilot can qualify for.

629
00:51:49,693 --> 00:51:51,763
I might just look into that.

630
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:56,082
There might come a time
when we'll remember this...

631
00:51:56,173 --> 00:51:58,926
as the day I started out
with a broken leg...

632
00:51:59,013 --> 00:52:01,686
and thanks to you
ended up strapped in a nose cone.

633
00:52:17,093 --> 00:52:20,563
If this were anyone else but me,
I'd say the altitude was to blame.

634
00:52:20,773 --> 00:52:22,684
- For what?
- The way I feel.

635
00:52:23,333 --> 00:52:25,051
You're not blacking out again?

636
00:52:26,013 --> 00:52:28,322
No. I never felt better in my life.

637
00:54:05,333 --> 00:54:08,006
I could have sworn we were alone.
Let's go.

638
00:54:10,733 --> 00:54:12,963
- Let me help you.
- I'll be all right.

639
00:54:13,053 --> 00:54:14,691
As your nurse, I insist.

640
00:54:18,373 --> 00:54:20,284
Don't walk so fast.

641
00:54:29,253 --> 00:54:30,481
Is it getting worse?

642
00:54:30,573 --> 00:54:33,167
A little. This stampede isn't helping either.

643
00:54:33,733 --> 00:54:36,850
You'd better get off your feet.
Come on. I'll take you home.

644
00:54:36,933 --> 00:54:38,207
Thank you.

645
00:54:43,093 --> 00:54:45,812
- By the way, do you live far from here?
- No.

646
00:54:46,653 --> 00:54:48,371
I'm way out at the other end of town.

647
00:54:48,453 --> 00:54:51,923
- Maybe if I could rest at your place...
- Of course.

648
00:54:52,053 --> 00:54:55,125
- I feel terrible about not believing you.
- Forget it.

649
00:54:55,213 --> 00:54:56,282
Hi, mister.

650
00:54:57,013 --> 00:55:00,323
Hi, kid. See you around.
Come on. Let's go, honey. It's getting late.

651
00:55:00,413 --> 00:55:03,132
Would you like me to kick you
in the shin again?

652
00:55:05,293 --> 00:55:08,365
Why don't you get lost, little boy.
What an imagination he's got.

653
00:55:08,453 --> 00:55:11,047
Come on. I could use another quarter.

654
00:55:14,213 --> 00:55:16,283
Here's a half a dollar. Now disappear.

655
00:55:19,173 --> 00:55:23,405
Little boy, did this man
really give you a quarter to kick him?

656
00:55:23,533 --> 00:55:26,331
Yes. He's some kind of nut.
Be careful, lady.

657
00:55:26,933 --> 00:55:28,002
So long.

658
00:55:28,893 --> 00:55:29,928
You miserable...

659
00:55:30,013 --> 00:55:32,243
Diane, believe me,
the kid's an absolute stranger.

660
00:55:32,333 --> 00:55:34,005
And you're an absolute liar.

661
00:55:34,093 --> 00:55:35,731
"I'm falling in love tonight."

662
00:55:35,813 --> 00:55:38,611
But I am. I mean, I was. I did.

663
00:55:38,973 --> 00:55:42,966
As far as I'm concerned,
you can go jump off the Space Needle!

664
00:55:43,413 --> 00:55:46,769
Diane, wait a minute.
Let me explain, will you?

665
00:55:47,373 --> 00:55:49,568
Diane, wait a minute.

666
00:55:50,373 --> 00:55:53,524
Mr. Mike, I'm so glad I found you.

667
00:55:53,613 --> 00:55:57,162
- I've been looking for you for hours.
- Just a second, honey.

668
00:55:57,573 --> 00:56:00,610
Mr. Mike, please,
my Uncle Walter has disappeared.

669
00:56:00,693 --> 00:56:01,762
Good.

670
00:56:01,853 --> 00:56:05,528
What am I going to do? He's gone.

671
00:56:05,693 --> 00:56:07,046
What? Who's gone?

672
00:56:07,733 --> 00:56:11,567
My Uncle Walter.
He went out with his truck this morning...

673
00:56:12,053 --> 00:56:15,887
to pick up a load for our trip home
and he never came back for me.

674
00:56:16,493 --> 00:56:18,324
Take it easy, honey.

675
00:56:18,653 --> 00:56:20,644
What time was he supposed
to come back?

676
00:56:20,733 --> 00:56:22,644
9:00 this morning.

677
00:56:22,733 --> 00:56:27,409
I waited at the rooming house
until almost 3:00 in the afternoon...

678
00:56:27,693 --> 00:56:30,002
but he didn't call or anything...

679
00:56:30,813 --> 00:56:33,008
so I came out here to look for you.

680
00:56:33,213 --> 00:56:36,762
- You're the only friend I have in Seattle.
- Don't cry.

681
00:56:39,893 --> 00:56:40,928
Blow.

682
00:56:41,453 --> 00:56:42,932
Again.

683
00:56:43,213 --> 00:56:44,566
That's my girl.

684
00:56:45,013 --> 00:56:47,049
You stop crying
and don't worry about a thing.

685
00:56:47,133 --> 00:56:49,852
- I'll help you find Uncle Walter.
- Thank you.

686
00:56:56,773 --> 00:56:58,525
Come on. The dice gets cold.

687
00:57:02,613 --> 00:57:05,446
That's all right. Not out. Still alive.

688
00:57:07,613 --> 00:57:09,490
- Get the door, will you?
- Thelma.

689
00:57:13,133 --> 00:57:16,443
Quick. Get in here. Hurry up.
You want Thelma to kill me?

690
00:57:17,413 --> 00:57:19,449
- What you got there?
- Twins.

691
00:57:19,573 --> 00:57:20,688
Excuse me.

692
00:57:20,773 --> 00:57:22,923
- Wait a minute.
- What are you doing?

693
00:57:23,413 --> 00:57:24,766
Hold it down, will you?

694
00:57:24,853 --> 00:57:25,888
Let the 10 ride.

695
00:57:27,413 --> 00:57:28,687
Seven or 11 does it.

696
00:57:28,773 --> 00:57:30,923
Come on, fellows, what do you say?

697
00:57:31,013 --> 00:57:32,287
Seven or 11.

698
00:57:32,613 --> 00:57:34,888
- Snake eyes. You lose.
- That's wonderful.

699
00:57:35,173 --> 00:57:36,401
There you go.

700
00:57:36,693 --> 00:57:39,161
What are Danny and those men
doing out there?

701
00:57:40,413 --> 00:57:42,324
They're having a business conference.

702
00:57:42,493 --> 00:57:43,892
What kind of business?

703
00:57:43,973 --> 00:57:45,565
Boxcars, you lose.

704
00:57:45,653 --> 00:57:47,245
They're railroad men.

705
00:57:48,133 --> 00:57:50,522
You'd better get undressed
and put your pajamas on.

706
00:57:50,613 --> 00:57:52,490
You'll have to turn around.

707
00:57:53,413 --> 00:57:56,371
I'll do better than that.
I'll leave the room, okay?

708
00:57:59,573 --> 00:58:01,006
Thank you.

709
00:58:03,573 --> 00:58:05,609
Come on. It's an easy point.

710
00:58:07,413 --> 00:58:08,562
Eight.

711
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:10,365
All right, fellows.

712
00:58:11,093 --> 00:58:13,163
- The game is over.
- What are you talking about?

713
00:58:13,253 --> 00:58:15,369
Hold it, fellows. I'll handle it.

714
00:58:16,733 --> 00:58:19,884
- What do you mean, the game's over?
- That's it. It's over.

715
00:58:19,973 --> 00:58:21,725
I get it, it's on account of the kid.

716
00:58:21,813 --> 00:58:23,531
- What's with her?
- Her uncle disappeared.

717
00:58:23,613 --> 00:58:25,922
- She's going to stay here all night.
- But why here?

718
00:58:26,013 --> 00:58:28,129
Because she doesn't have
any other place to stay.

719
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:30,169
What if her uncle comes back
looking for her?

720
00:58:30,253 --> 00:58:31,447
I left word she'd be here.

721
00:58:31,533 --> 00:58:33,444
I'm sorry, fellows.
You're gonna have to go.

722
00:58:33,533 --> 00:58:36,650
Let's go to my trailer.
It's my wife's bowling night.

723
00:58:36,733 --> 00:58:40,203
Stick around. We can be quiet.
We're just betting paper money.

724
00:58:40,373 --> 00:58:42,841
Hurry up, Danny, before the dice cool off.

725
00:58:42,933 --> 00:58:44,605
Nice going. Now I lose the house's cut.

726
00:58:44,693 --> 00:58:45,762
The house's cut?

727
00:58:45,853 --> 00:58:48,413
You won't be happy
until we're both in front of a judge.

728
00:58:48,493 --> 00:58:51,451
At least I am trying to scratch up a buck,
not run a nursery.

729
00:58:51,533 --> 00:58:53,330
Come on, Danny.

730
00:58:53,413 --> 00:58:55,768
You'd better get back to your crap game.

731
00:59:05,253 --> 00:59:08,131
And God bless Uncle Walter
and God bless Mr. Mike.

732
00:59:08,653 --> 00:59:10,484
Time for you to go to bed, little lady.

733
00:59:10,573 --> 00:59:12,484
- Good night, Mr. Mike.
- Good night, Sue-Lin.

734
00:59:12,573 --> 00:59:14,404
I'll turn your bed down.

735
00:59:15,293 --> 00:59:18,569
You just go right to sleep
and don't worry about a thing...

736
00:59:19,493 --> 00:59:22,166
because tomorrow
you'll be back with Uncle Walter.

737
00:59:22,773 --> 00:59:25,845
- All right?
- I can't help worrying a little.

738
00:59:25,933 --> 00:59:28,652
- What if I can't go to sleep?
- Just close your eyes.

739
00:59:31,933 --> 00:59:33,446
Both of them.

740
01:01:27,089 --> 01:01:30,764
- Hello.
- Hello, Diane. It's Mike Edwards.

741
01:02:07,169 --> 01:02:08,761
Still no U-N-C-L-E?

742
01:02:09,089 --> 01:02:11,398
No. We haven't found him yet.

743
01:02:12,609 --> 01:02:14,884
You look beat.
Go in and have a glass of milk.

744
01:02:14,969 --> 01:02:17,563
- Okay. Do you want one?
- Maybe later. You go ahead.

745
01:02:21,009 --> 01:02:23,284
- You try the cops?
- Yep. They don't have a thing.

746
01:02:23,369 --> 01:02:25,166
Why don't you get ahold of her folks?

747
01:02:25,249 --> 01:02:27,126
Uncle Walter is the whole family.

748
01:02:27,449 --> 01:02:29,280
That's rough, old buddy...

749
01:02:29,569 --> 01:02:32,800
but we've done all we can.
This is a job for, like, a social worker.

750
01:02:32,889 --> 01:02:33,924
No dice.

751
01:02:34,009 --> 01:02:35,681
They'd put her in some detention home.

752
01:02:35,769 --> 01:02:38,203
Why don't you soften up?
She's a helpless little girl.

753
01:02:38,289 --> 01:02:40,723
I liked it better
when you stuck to helpless big girls.

754
01:02:40,809 --> 01:02:42,925
After all,
we didn't come to Seattle to baby-sit.

755
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:44,124
It won't be for long.

756
01:02:44,209 --> 01:02:46,439
Long enough for you
to strike out with that nurse.

757
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:49,089
I've already struck out.
Last night she hung up on me.

758
01:02:49,169 --> 01:02:50,727
Besides, Sue-Lin comes first.

759
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:53,881
Look, chum. Get back on the ground.
This is no place for a kid...

760
01:02:53,969 --> 01:02:56,085
- and you know it.
- It'll have to do, buddy.

761
01:02:56,169 --> 01:02:58,046
Gin time, Danny boy.

762
01:02:59,209 --> 01:03:02,804
Thelma's gone to the dressmaker.
I'm free for a mad half-hour.

763
01:03:02,889 --> 01:03:05,881
- What'll it be? Your place or mine?
- It'll have to be yours.

764
01:03:05,969 --> 01:03:08,608
It seems the pied piper here
is entertaining.

765
01:03:44,209 --> 01:03:45,528
Mike!

766
01:03:52,489 --> 01:03:56,004
- What's the matter, honey?
- I feel kind of sick and dizzy.

767
01:03:56,489 --> 01:03:58,878
You're burning up.
How long have you been like this?

768
01:03:58,969 --> 01:04:01,608
It started all of a sudden, but I'll be okay.

769
01:04:01,689 --> 01:04:03,805
You will not be okay. I'll call a doctor.

770
01:04:03,889 --> 01:04:05,481
No, Mike. Please.

771
01:04:05,809 --> 01:04:08,721
- But, honey, you have a temperature.
- I'm afraid of doctors.

772
01:04:08,809 --> 01:04:10,128
They're men.

773
01:04:10,729 --> 01:04:14,802
- Don't be silly. I'll be right back.
- I won't mind a lady doctor or a nurse.

774
01:04:14,889 --> 01:04:19,167
I know. Why don't you call
that nice Miss Warren at the fair?

775
01:04:19,249 --> 01:04:21,683
- No.
- I bet she could make me feel better.

776
01:04:21,769 --> 01:04:24,920
- Lf I thought it would...
- Please, won't you call her?

777
01:04:27,329 --> 01:04:29,718
Almost 6:00. Okay. I'll give it a try.

778
01:04:30,809 --> 01:04:33,243
You just lie still. I'll be right back.

779
01:04:51,169 --> 01:04:53,524
- Hello.
- Hello. Miss Warren?

780
01:04:53,889 --> 01:04:56,278
- Speaking.
- Diane, this is Mike Edwards.

781
01:04:56,609 --> 01:04:58,918
Please don't hang up. This is important.

782
01:04:59,009 --> 01:05:00,601
I'm sure it is.

783
01:05:00,689 --> 01:05:03,920
I suppose you're soliciting funds
for a broken-leg telethon.

784
01:05:04,009 --> 01:05:05,761
No. Now listen.

785
01:05:05,849 --> 01:05:09,364
You remember Sue-Lin, the girl
I brought in the dispensary the other day?

786
01:05:09,449 --> 01:05:12,839
She's staying with me and she's sick,
and she's asking for you.

787
01:05:13,289 --> 01:05:15,598
What did you do, kick her in the leg?

788
01:05:16,609 --> 01:05:19,328
This is on the level.
She's got some kind of fever.

789
01:05:19,449 --> 01:05:21,326
It was her idea to call you.

790
01:05:21,409 --> 01:05:24,606
I'm sorry, Mr. Edwards,
but I just don't believe you.

791
01:05:25,689 --> 01:05:27,600
Mike, can I speak to her?

792
01:05:27,689 --> 01:05:29,919
No. What are you doing out here?
Go back inside.

793
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:32,318
Please. Maybe she'll believe me.

794
01:05:32,609 --> 01:05:35,407
- Hello.
- I doubt it, but you can try.

795
01:05:35,489 --> 01:05:37,081
Just a second, please.

796
01:05:40,089 --> 01:05:41,204
Hello, Miss Warren.

797
01:05:42,369 --> 01:05:43,563
Sue-Lin?

798
01:05:43,649 --> 01:05:46,402
It's really me,
and I did ask Mike to call you.

799
01:05:46,489 --> 01:05:50,243
My head's all hot.
Would you come and fix me?

800
01:05:51,729 --> 01:05:53,128
I can't right now.

801
01:05:53,609 --> 01:05:54,678
Please.

802
01:05:54,769 --> 01:05:58,523
We're at the Century 21 Estates
on Lakeview Road.

803
01:05:58,689 --> 01:06:00,725
Would you, Miss Warren?

804
01:06:02,089 --> 01:06:06,048
All right, Sue-Lin.
Just cover up and keep warm.

805
01:06:06,529 --> 01:06:08,679
I'll get there just as soon as I can.

806
01:06:08,769 --> 01:06:11,124
Thank you, Miss Warren. Good-bye.

807
01:06:11,609 --> 01:06:13,167
Goody. She's coming.

808
01:06:13,809 --> 01:06:16,607
- Say, are you starting to feel better?
- No.

809
01:06:18,489 --> 01:06:21,003
Don't misunderstand me.
I wish you a speedy recovery...

810
01:06:21,089 --> 01:06:23,080
but not before she gets here.

811
01:06:56,369 --> 01:06:57,802
Would you come in?

812
01:07:01,089 --> 01:07:02,442
Where's Sue-Lin?

813
01:07:02,969 --> 01:07:05,278
She's right back there in bed.

814
01:07:05,969 --> 01:07:07,322
She'd better be.

815
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:09,560
Come with me, please.

816
01:07:13,249 --> 01:07:14,364
Sue-Lin?

817
01:07:16,049 --> 01:07:19,837
- Hello, Miss Warren.
- Why, what happened to you, little lady?

818
01:07:20,449 --> 01:07:23,088
Have you been eating
some more of those Belgian waffles?

819
01:07:23,169 --> 01:07:25,285
No. I just don't feel so fine.

820
01:07:26,049 --> 01:07:27,402
We'll fix you up.

821
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:30,524
Let's take a look at your throat first.

822
01:07:32,049 --> 01:07:33,164
Say "ah."

823
01:07:35,809 --> 01:07:38,039
There's no inflammation.

824
01:07:38,409 --> 01:07:40,445
I'd better take your temperature.

825
01:07:40,529 --> 01:07:43,646
You want to check her leg for footprints?

826
01:07:43,809 --> 01:07:45,845
My leg doesn't hurt.

827
01:07:46,049 --> 01:07:48,643
Mr. Edwards was merely
being funny, dear.

828
01:07:49,089 --> 01:07:51,683
Excuse me. Did you say merely or nearly?

829
01:07:52,409 --> 01:07:55,207
I don't suppose you'd have time
to fix a cold compress.

830
01:07:55,649 --> 01:07:57,685
I might be able to squeeze it in.

831
01:07:58,529 --> 01:08:01,680
My throat's dry.
Could I have a glass of water, please?

832
01:08:01,969 --> 01:08:05,086
Yes, you may.
But you keep that right there, okay.

833
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:08,440
- The water's in the kitchen.
- All right.

834
01:08:27,489 --> 01:08:30,447
- Excuse me. You want this very cold?
- Very cold.

835
01:08:33,329 --> 01:08:35,160
It's cold, all right.

836
01:08:37,569 --> 01:08:39,400
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

837
01:08:40,009 --> 01:08:42,318
You do have a temperature, 101.

838
01:08:42,409 --> 01:08:45,685
I thought it would be higher than that.

839
01:08:45,929 --> 01:08:48,443
Sue-Lin, how do you
happen to be staying here?

840
01:08:48,609 --> 01:08:52,602
I came to Seattle with my Uncle Walter,
but he got lost.

841
01:08:52,809 --> 01:08:56,085
So Mike said I could live here
until we found him.

842
01:08:56,449 --> 01:08:58,679
- Are you and Mike old friends?
- No.

843
01:08:58,769 --> 01:09:02,921
I just met him two days ago.
He's the nicest man I've ever known.

844
01:09:04,809 --> 01:09:07,164
I must say he's full of surprises.

845
01:09:08,169 --> 01:09:09,727
What's the verdict?

846
01:09:10,089 --> 01:09:14,048
She does have a little temperature,
but I don't think it's serious.

847
01:09:14,689 --> 01:09:17,078
Here, honey. You take these.

848
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:20,918
There. That's a girl.

849
01:09:24,409 --> 01:09:27,481
That's it.
Now I want you to get some sleep.

850
01:09:27,649 --> 01:09:30,527
- All right. Good night.
- Good night, dear.

851
01:09:39,089 --> 01:09:40,761
Good night, Sue-Lin.

852
01:09:49,969 --> 01:09:52,085
Thanks for coming over
to see Sue-Lin, Miss Warren.

853
01:09:52,169 --> 01:09:53,602
I'm glad I did.

854
01:09:54,329 --> 01:09:57,241
- Do you have a cigarette?
- Sure. Right outside.

855
01:10:04,409 --> 01:10:07,003
You've certainly been sweet to Sue-Lin.

856
01:10:07,449 --> 01:10:09,883
Do you have any idea
what happened to her uncle?

857
01:10:09,969 --> 01:10:11,163
Not a clue.

858
01:10:11,249 --> 01:10:14,924
There's nobody else to get in touch with
because he's her only relative.

859
01:10:15,009 --> 01:10:19,082
Mike, you know, you really should notify
the Child Welfare Board.

860
01:10:19,449 --> 01:10:21,087
No, I don't want to do that.

861
01:10:21,289 --> 01:10:24,167
I'll care for her myself
until her uncle comes back.

862
01:10:24,249 --> 01:10:26,558
- But suppose he doesn't?
- He will.

863
01:10:27,009 --> 01:10:30,126
- You'll keep her here until he does?
- Sure. I guess so.

864
01:10:30,209 --> 01:10:32,723
I mean, if she wants to stay, why not?

865
01:10:33,489 --> 01:10:35,719
You're a very remarkable guy.

866
01:12:50,649 --> 01:12:52,560
Hubba, hubba!

867
01:12:59,929 --> 01:13:02,568
I tell you, this place comes
equipped with everything.

868
01:13:02,649 --> 01:13:04,321
Knock it off, Danny.

869
01:13:04,569 --> 01:13:07,242
Scusi, scusi. Tonight I'm very Italian.

870
01:13:07,329 --> 01:13:09,479
- Tonight you're very drunk.
- Little snort of vino?

871
01:13:09,569 --> 01:13:10,888
No, thank you.

872
01:13:11,609 --> 01:13:13,201
Aren't you gonna introduce me?

873
01:13:13,689 --> 01:13:16,249
Diane Warren, this is Danny Burke,
my partner.

874
01:13:16,649 --> 01:13:18,002
How do you do?

875
01:13:18,929 --> 01:13:22,638
So you're the big attraction at the fair?
Quite an exhibit, old buddy.

876
01:13:24,049 --> 01:13:26,358
Mike, I think I'd better be going.

877
01:13:26,809 --> 01:13:28,606
All right, I'll get your things.

878
01:13:29,209 --> 01:13:32,724
- It was very nice meeting you.
- No trouble. Drop by anytime, beautiful.

879
01:13:32,809 --> 01:13:35,277
- You sure do brighten up the terrain.
- Excuse me.

880
01:13:36,249 --> 01:13:38,968
- Excuse me, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

881
01:13:42,369 --> 01:13:44,599
You don't have to leave on my account.

882
01:13:46,169 --> 01:13:48,888
- I'll call you tomorrow at the dispensary.
- Please do.

883
01:13:48,969 --> 01:13:50,641
- Good night.
- Good night.

884
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:53,918
Good night.

885
01:13:54,369 --> 01:13:57,441
You didn't tell me
she was put together like that.

886
01:13:57,689 --> 01:14:00,249
Can't you tell a nice girl
when you meet one?

887
01:14:01,369 --> 01:14:04,759
Now he's a Cub Scout. What happened?
Somebody steal your wolf whistle?

888
01:14:04,849 --> 01:14:08,205
Forget it. I just happen to feel
a little different about Diane.

889
01:14:08,649 --> 01:14:09,843
That's all we need.

890
01:14:09,929 --> 01:14:13,842
Stone broke, our plane in hock,
and you start smelling orange blossoms.

891
01:14:13,929 --> 01:14:15,885
Buddy, this is not the time.

892
01:14:15,969 --> 01:14:19,041
I'm sorry. You don't plan these things.
They just happen, you know.

893
01:14:19,129 --> 01:14:21,085
What about our little old airplane, Bessie?

894
01:14:21,169 --> 01:14:23,842
When we have our little old airplane back,
she's all yours.

895
01:14:23,929 --> 01:14:25,999
- You're gonna give up flying?
- Not exactly.

896
01:14:26,089 --> 01:14:29,525
I've been thinking about signing up
for something in the space program.

897
01:14:29,609 --> 01:14:30,962
Space!

898
01:14:31,049 --> 01:14:34,803
Beautiful. You'd be perfect.
You got a head full of it.

899
01:14:35,409 --> 01:14:37,400
I never claimed to be the brains
of this team.

900
01:14:37,489 --> 01:14:39,207
You can say that again.

901
01:14:39,289 --> 01:14:40,927
I got to check Sue-Lin.

902
01:14:42,409 --> 01:14:44,604
Two bourbons on the rocks, thanks.

903
01:14:45,289 --> 01:14:47,723
Two bourbons on the rocks for table three.

904
01:14:51,249 --> 01:14:53,683
- Danny Burke!
- Hiya, gumdrop.

905
01:14:55,409 --> 01:14:58,367
- When did you get in town?
- A couple of days ago.

906
01:14:58,889 --> 01:15:01,483
- You didn't call me.
- I've been on a tight schedule.

907
01:15:01,569 --> 01:15:02,843
But we'll make up for that.

908
01:15:02,929 --> 01:15:05,489
I spoke to Vince on the phone,
he said to meet him here.

909
01:15:05,569 --> 01:15:06,684
Over here, Danny.

910
01:15:06,769 --> 01:15:07,918
Hey, Vince!

911
01:15:08,009 --> 01:15:11,558
Honey, as soon as I'm through with him,
there's a favor I'd like to ask you.

912
01:15:11,649 --> 01:15:13,321
This isn't a touch.

913
01:15:13,409 --> 01:15:15,718
- You name it, Danny.
- I'll do that, doll-face.

914
01:15:15,809 --> 01:15:17,322
See you later.

915
01:15:22,289 --> 01:15:25,486
Sit down. How are the two boy aviators?

916
01:15:25,569 --> 01:15:27,321
Grounded. How about yourself?

917
01:15:27,409 --> 01:15:28,842
Slugging along.

918
01:15:29,209 --> 01:15:32,281
I'm glad you called.
I got a job for you if you're interested.

919
01:15:32,369 --> 01:15:33,563
A flying job?

920
01:15:34,209 --> 01:15:36,769
Unless you're available for another kind.

921
01:15:36,849 --> 01:15:40,319
No. We're still pilots,
only our plane's on ice.

922
01:15:40,889 --> 01:15:42,208
Again?

923
01:15:42,289 --> 01:15:46,487
Our pal the sheriff put a padlock on it.
Little matter of the $1,200 we owe.

924
01:15:47,449 --> 01:15:50,964
Think you could bail her out in time
to run some freight to Canada tonight?

925
01:15:51,649 --> 01:15:53,526
Sure, if we had the loot.

926
01:15:54,169 --> 01:15:56,558
- You've got it.
- Come on.

927
01:15:57,009 --> 01:16:00,684
I'll toss in another $200
when the work's finished. How about that?

928
01:16:01,009 --> 01:16:05,002
Boy, you're a lifesaver. I've been racking
my brain how to get Mike out of town.

929
01:16:05,489 --> 01:16:07,400
He in some kind of a jam?

930
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:09,606
Woman trouble up to here.

931
01:16:10,569 --> 01:16:12,161
But he doesn't think so.

932
01:16:14,249 --> 01:16:16,968
I forgot the name of the mouse at the bar.

933
01:16:18,129 --> 01:16:19,448
Lily.

934
01:16:20,529 --> 01:16:21,848
Lily, yeah.

935
01:16:23,129 --> 01:16:26,439
I've got to see her about a phone call.
Be right back.

936
01:16:36,089 --> 01:16:37,920
- Hi, Mike!
- Hi, honey.

937
01:16:39,569 --> 01:16:41,525
I'm sorry. Still no luck.

938
01:16:43,809 --> 01:16:47,245
Sometimes I wonder
if Uncle Walter's ever coming back.

939
01:16:47,329 --> 01:16:50,082
Come on now, let's have some
positive thinking around here.

940
01:16:50,169 --> 01:16:53,161
But why would he go away
and leave me all alone?

941
01:16:53,249 --> 01:16:56,161
Alone? With friends like Danny,
Diane, and me?

942
01:16:56,649 --> 01:16:58,719
That's right. I do have friends.

943
01:17:00,129 --> 01:17:02,324
- I see you're making some new ones.
- New ones?

944
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:03,558
Sure.

945
01:17:03,649 --> 01:17:06,447
Like the clown with the green face
that looks like you.

946
01:17:06,529 --> 01:17:09,965
- I don't have a green face.
- You don't now. You gave it to him.

947
01:17:10,049 --> 01:17:13,405
- Mike, you're just teasing me.
- I'm not teasing.

948
01:17:13,489 --> 01:17:15,207
He has got your face.

949
01:20:40,529 --> 01:20:42,087
You feel better?

950
01:20:45,609 --> 01:20:47,406
Clear the strip and start your motors.

951
01:20:47,489 --> 01:20:49,719
- Hi, Danny.
- Hiya, cutie.

952
01:20:50,209 --> 01:20:52,006
See how Tiger's doing.

953
01:20:52,649 --> 01:20:57,200
And you, strap on your parachute, buddy,
because we're airborne.

954
01:20:57,289 --> 01:20:58,404
What's the word?

955
01:20:58,489 --> 01:21:00,684
The word is money. $1,200.

956
01:21:00,769 --> 01:21:02,521
Dauntless Daniel has done it again.

957
01:21:02,609 --> 01:21:04,247
- $1,200?
- Right.

958
01:21:04,329 --> 01:21:07,241
With extra for incidentals.
We're out of the trenches, partner.

959
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:08,808
Where did you get $1,200?

960
01:21:08,889 --> 01:21:12,165
It's an advance.
We got a job working for Vince Bradley.

961
01:21:12,249 --> 01:21:13,602
What kind of a job?

962
01:21:13,689 --> 01:21:17,284
Hauling some freight to Canada.
There's $200 more coming after delivery.

963
01:21:17,369 --> 01:21:19,803
Why should that pirate be so nice to us?

964
01:21:19,889 --> 01:21:22,278
It's a business proposition.
He needs transport.

965
01:21:22,369 --> 01:21:24,325
- Lf he needs transport...
- Come on.

966
01:21:24,409 --> 01:21:26,877
We gotta catch the 2:00 bus
for Sherrington.

967
01:21:27,689 --> 01:21:31,238
- And we'll say good-bye to Sue-Lin.
- Wait a minute. Who'll take care of her?

968
01:21:31,849 --> 01:21:35,239
Barney can keep an eye on her.
We'll be back in a couple of hours.

969
01:21:35,329 --> 01:21:38,048
Is it okay if Barney takes care of you
for a few hours?

970
01:21:38,129 --> 01:21:41,280
- Sure. I'll be a big girl.
- Okay, but...

971
01:21:47,289 --> 01:21:50,008
- How do you do?
- How do you do? Mr. Michael Edwards?

972
01:21:50,329 --> 01:21:53,002
- I'm Miss Ettinger. May I come in?
- Please do.

973
01:21:58,089 --> 01:22:00,557
- "Child Welfare Board"?
- Yes.

974
01:22:01,929 --> 01:22:03,999
- Would you sit down, please?
- Thank you.

975
01:22:05,889 --> 01:22:08,801
- You must be Sue-Lin.
- Yes.

976
01:22:10,089 --> 01:22:11,841
What do you want, Miss Ettinger?

977
01:22:11,929 --> 01:22:15,319
I'm afraid Sue-Lin will have
to come with me, Mr. Edwards.

978
01:22:16,729 --> 01:22:17,923
I'm sorry.

979
01:22:18,009 --> 01:22:20,887
But an abandoned child
without any relatives automatically...

980
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:23,927
- becomes a ward of the county.
- But she's not abandoned, ma'am.

981
01:22:24,009 --> 01:22:26,318
We're taking care of her
till her uncle comes back.

982
01:22:26,409 --> 01:22:28,604
There's no telling how long that will be.

983
01:22:28,689 --> 01:22:30,919
You can see our position.
You're two bachelors...

984
01:22:31,009 --> 01:22:33,762
living in a trailer, neither of you employed.

985
01:22:33,849 --> 01:22:36,647
Please, Mike, I don't wanna go.
Don't let her take me!

986
01:22:36,729 --> 01:22:39,004
We were just hired
for a job today, right, Danny?

987
01:22:39,089 --> 01:22:42,081
And while you're doing it,
who's going to take care of Sue-Lin?

988
01:22:44,449 --> 01:22:47,043
It's rolling time, Danny boy. I got the dice!

989
01:22:48,729 --> 01:22:50,924
Boys, we have company.

990
01:22:51,369 --> 01:22:53,360
Excuse us. I'm sorry.

991
01:22:53,769 --> 01:22:55,600
Let's go to my place.

992
01:22:59,049 --> 01:23:01,040
Be reasonable, Mr. Edwards.

993
01:23:01,129 --> 01:23:04,280
This is hardly a favorable environment
for a child.

994
01:23:07,569 --> 01:23:11,357
- She's right, Sue-Lin.
- I don't want to go.

995
01:23:11,449 --> 01:23:15,078
I don't want you to either, honey,
but I'm afraid you have to.

996
01:23:15,289 --> 01:23:17,803
I love you. Do you love me?

997
01:23:18,249 --> 01:23:19,682
You know I do.

998
01:23:20,169 --> 01:23:23,844
They won't keep you very long, I promise.
I'll come up and see you every day.

999
01:23:23,929 --> 01:23:27,683
When Uncle Walter comes back,
we'll have a big party, all right?

1000
01:23:28,089 --> 01:23:30,239
Now, don't cry. Don't cry.

1001
01:23:31,049 --> 01:23:33,119
Go to get your things packed.

1002
01:23:38,129 --> 01:23:40,165
I'd better give them a hand.

1003
01:23:42,849 --> 01:23:45,124
- Good-bye, honey.
- Good-bye, Mike.

1004
01:23:45,529 --> 01:23:47,918
- Good-bye, Danny.
- So long, cutie.

1005
01:23:49,129 --> 01:23:52,041
- We'll take good care of her, Mr. Edwards.
- Yes, ma'am.

1006
01:23:52,529 --> 01:23:54,884
Before you go,
I wonder if you'd tell me something.

1007
01:23:54,969 --> 01:23:56,402
Yes, of course.

1008
01:23:56,489 --> 01:23:58,480
How did you know Sue-Lin was here?

1009
01:23:58,569 --> 01:24:00,161
A complaint was filed.

1010
01:24:00,249 --> 01:24:02,046
A complaint? By whom?

1011
01:24:02,129 --> 01:24:04,962
I guess you have a right to know.
Miss Diane Warren.

1012
01:24:06,169 --> 01:24:07,363
Diane?

1013
01:24:08,529 --> 01:24:10,008
Are you sure?

1014
01:24:10,369 --> 01:24:12,678
I received the phone call myself.

1015
01:24:13,369 --> 01:24:15,564
I take it you know her.

1016
01:24:17,849 --> 01:24:19,362
I thought I did.

1017
01:24:19,689 --> 01:24:21,407
I'm sorry, Mr. Edwards.

1018
01:24:21,489 --> 01:24:24,447
Good-bye, Mike. Good-bye, Danny.

1019
01:24:24,529 --> 01:24:26,918
- I don't want to go!
- Good-bye.

1020
01:24:33,049 --> 01:24:34,641
Good-bye, Sue-Lin.

1021
01:24:41,009 --> 01:24:43,079
Why did it have to be Diane?

1022
01:24:43,449 --> 01:24:47,601
That's the one thing I can't understand.
Why would she do a thing like this?

1023
01:24:49,169 --> 01:24:51,364
And I had to fall for her...

1024
01:24:51,449 --> 01:24:54,725
a dame who goes around
making everybody's decisions for them.

1025
01:24:54,809 --> 01:24:57,801
She must think she's got
the only brain in town.

1026
01:24:58,649 --> 01:25:01,641
Anyway, I'm glad I got
a good look at this side of her.

1027
01:25:03,729 --> 01:25:05,879
What time does that bus leave?

1028
01:25:05,969 --> 01:25:08,119
- 2:00.
- Let's go.

1029
01:25:17,849 --> 01:25:21,159
Did you see that sheriff's face
when we handed him that dough?

1030
01:25:21,369 --> 01:25:24,441
I bet he still thinks
we printed it up ourselves.

1031
01:25:28,329 --> 01:25:31,446
Come on. Smile a little!
We'll be in Seattle soon.

1032
01:25:31,529 --> 01:25:35,488
We'll load up for Canada and it's off we go
into the wild blue yonder, right?

1033
01:25:37,969 --> 01:25:39,084
Right.

1034
01:26:28,129 --> 01:26:30,768
We better check and see if Vince is here.

1035
01:26:30,849 --> 01:26:33,602
- You check. I'm gonna call Sue-Lin.
- Right.

1036
01:26:50,849 --> 01:26:53,568
Hello, I'd like to speak
with Miss Ettinger, please.

1037
01:26:53,649 --> 01:26:55,401
Speaking.

1038
01:26:55,489 --> 01:26:58,083
This is Mike Edwards.
How is Sue-Lin getting along?

1039
01:26:58,169 --> 01:27:01,400
Mr. Edwards, where are you?
We thought Sue-Lin was with you.

1040
01:27:01,489 --> 01:27:04,447
With me? What are you talking about?
I'm at the airport.

1041
01:27:04,569 --> 01:27:06,207
- We just flew in.
- Airport?

1042
01:27:07,729 --> 01:27:09,879
Sue-Lin ran away this afternoon,
and naturally...

1043
01:27:09,969 --> 01:27:11,084
Ran away?

1044
01:27:11,169 --> 01:27:13,683
I had to leave her in my office alone
for a few minutes.

1045
01:27:13,769 --> 01:27:14,963
That's just dandy!

1046
01:27:15,049 --> 01:27:17,882
You're telling me I can't take care of a kid.

1047
01:27:17,969 --> 01:27:19,038
May I?

1048
01:27:20,769 --> 01:27:22,521
Mike, this is Diane.

1049
01:27:22,889 --> 01:27:25,881
What are you doing there?
Taking a bow for the mess you've made?

1050
01:27:25,969 --> 01:27:27,721
Mike, listen... Hello?

1051
01:27:30,209 --> 01:27:32,040
He wouldn't even listen.

1052
01:27:32,729 --> 01:27:34,685
I'm going to check
with Mr. Barney Thatcher.

1053
01:27:35,609 --> 01:27:37,804
Danny, I gotta get into town.

1054
01:27:38,489 --> 01:27:39,968
You gotta get into town?

1055
01:27:40,049 --> 01:27:42,927
- Sue-Lin's run away.
- No, Vince will be here any minute.

1056
01:27:43,009 --> 01:27:45,364
You load up
and I'll come back as soon as I can.

1057
01:27:45,449 --> 01:27:47,167
We got a job to do!

1058
01:27:57,769 --> 01:27:59,122
That'll be $5.60.

1059
01:28:00,289 --> 01:28:02,120
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

1060
01:28:05,329 --> 01:28:07,479
Barney, Sue-Lin ran away.

1061
01:28:07,569 --> 01:28:09,844
- Don't I know it, she was here.
- Where is she?

1062
01:28:09,929 --> 01:28:11,328
Why'd you let her go?

1063
01:28:11,409 --> 01:28:13,877
I never even laid eyes on her.
She left you a note.

1064
01:28:13,969 --> 01:28:16,563
- Come on, let's have it.
- I'm looking for it.

1065
01:28:16,649 --> 01:28:18,640
Come on, I gotta find her.

1066
01:28:23,729 --> 01:28:26,289
I didn't get that part, either.
What does she mean?

1067
01:28:26,369 --> 01:28:29,520
- She'll wait for you in her dream car.
- Her dream car.

1068
01:28:30,369 --> 01:28:32,519
Sure. Barney, can I use
your station wagon?

1069
01:28:32,609 --> 01:28:33,678
Go.

1070
01:28:33,889 --> 01:28:37,438
- Don't say anything about the note.
- Mike, you think I'm a stoolie?

1071
01:28:39,009 --> 01:28:40,761
That welfare doll is back.

1072
01:28:40,849 --> 01:28:42,407
- Give me the keys.
- Go out the back.

1073
01:28:42,489 --> 01:28:44,844
- Remember, I wasn't here.
- Hurry up.

1074
01:28:53,889 --> 01:28:56,039
- Have you seen...
- Good evening, why should I lie?

1075
01:28:56,129 --> 01:28:57,767
I've got nothing to hide.

1076
01:29:07,369 --> 01:29:10,361
- Any sign of him?
- I told you he had to run an errand.

1077
01:29:10,569 --> 01:29:12,685
What do you mean, run an errand?

1078
01:29:12,769 --> 01:29:15,806
Keep your shirt on, Vince,
he'll be right back.

1079
01:29:16,329 --> 01:29:19,002
He'd better, or you're going without him.

1080
01:29:19,289 --> 01:29:21,678
All right, come on, let's load the plane.

1081
01:30:33,689 --> 01:30:34,917
Sue-Lin!

1082
01:30:51,809 --> 01:30:53,720
What are you doing here?

1083
01:30:56,209 --> 01:30:58,165
Mike, I knew you'd come!

1084
01:30:58,249 --> 01:31:00,365
You've got half of Seattle looking for you.

1085
01:31:00,449 --> 01:31:03,725
I don't mean to be bad, Mike,
but don't let them take me back again.

1086
01:31:03,809 --> 01:31:06,607
Okay, we'll play it your way.
Let's get out of here.

1087
01:31:06,689 --> 01:31:09,283
- Where are we going?
- The airport. We got our plane back.

1088
01:31:09,369 --> 01:31:12,520
Who's in there? Who's in here?

1089
01:31:12,849 --> 01:31:15,647
Let's go. Jump.

1090
01:31:17,049 --> 01:31:18,164
Hey, you!

1091
01:31:33,489 --> 01:31:35,286
- You two!
- Let's go.

1092
01:31:35,729 --> 01:31:36,764
Hold it!

1093
01:31:37,689 --> 01:31:38,917
Stop!

1094
01:31:45,689 --> 01:31:46,883
Stop them.

1095
01:31:48,729 --> 01:31:51,197
They got us surrounded.
Let's get out of here.

1096
01:31:56,489 --> 01:31:59,128
- Don't let him get away!
- Head him off!

1097
01:32:10,249 --> 01:32:12,160
Don't let him get away!

1098
01:32:18,529 --> 01:32:19,598
Stop!

1099
01:32:22,929 --> 01:32:25,841
Hurry, Mr. Mike! They're coming! Hurry!

1100
01:32:28,609 --> 01:32:29,928
Hurry, Mike!

1101
01:32:30,609 --> 01:32:32,281
All right. I'm hurrying.

1102
01:32:44,889 --> 01:32:46,117
Hold it!

1103
01:32:56,769 --> 01:32:58,964
- Hang on.
- Mike, hurry!

1104
01:33:08,969 --> 01:33:10,288
Come on.

1105
01:33:13,129 --> 01:33:15,040
Now look, you've stalled long enough.

1106
01:33:15,129 --> 01:33:16,767
Now get this crate rolling.

1107
01:33:16,849 --> 01:33:18,680
Listen, Vince, I'm superstitious.

1108
01:33:18,769 --> 01:33:20,202
I can't leave without Mike.

1109
01:33:20,289 --> 01:33:23,520
I'm superstitious, too,
and you're leaving without Mike.

1110
01:33:24,489 --> 01:33:26,844
Get that thing closed. Lock it up.

1111
01:33:30,089 --> 01:33:31,920
- Get rid of her.
- Mike!

1112
01:33:35,169 --> 01:33:36,682
Danny, where is Mike?

1113
01:33:36,769 --> 01:33:40,079
He went to town to look for the kid.
I don't expect him back.

1114
01:33:40,169 --> 01:33:41,887
Happy landings to me.

1115
01:33:42,329 --> 01:33:44,240
Are you flying somewhere tonight?

1116
01:33:44,329 --> 01:33:46,160
That's right. See you around.

1117
01:33:46,249 --> 01:33:48,319
- Without Mike?
- Sure. Why not?

1118
01:34:00,169 --> 01:34:01,966
Mike. Sue-Lin.

1119
01:34:02,449 --> 01:34:03,802
Mike, please.

1120
01:34:03,889 --> 01:34:05,720
- It's about time.
- Okay.

1121
01:34:05,969 --> 01:34:07,800
Mike, you have to believe me.

1122
01:34:07,889 --> 01:34:10,642
I did not report Sue-Lin
to the welfare department.

1123
01:34:10,729 --> 01:34:13,687
- What is this, a PTA meeting?
- Who's he?

1124
01:34:13,769 --> 01:34:16,567
Shut your trap. Mike, you're late.
Let's get moving.

1125
01:34:16,649 --> 01:34:19,447
- Okay, just don't panic. Come on.
- Without the kid.

1126
01:34:19,809 --> 01:34:22,084
What do you mean,
what difference does it make?

1127
01:34:22,169 --> 01:34:24,888
She's a fugitive. I don't want cops
crawling around here.

1128
01:34:24,969 --> 01:34:27,005
- Why not?
- Never mind why not.

1129
01:34:27,689 --> 01:34:30,487
Blue Eyes can take care of her
until you come back.

1130
01:34:35,729 --> 01:34:37,685
How did you get roped into this?

1131
01:34:37,769 --> 01:34:40,078
Smuggling furs. The deal's off.

1132
01:34:40,169 --> 01:34:43,559
- You heard him, Vince, the deal's off.
- Guess again, Danny.

1133
01:34:43,649 --> 01:34:45,765
- Now get over there!
- You're a big man, Danny.

1134
01:34:45,849 --> 01:34:47,805
Now you two rover boys listen close.

1135
01:34:47,889 --> 01:34:49,800
I bailed out this mix master for you.

1136
01:34:49,889 --> 01:34:51,800
Now you're gonna bail me out.

1137
01:34:52,929 --> 01:34:55,523
The kid stays. Come here, kid!
You, too, Blue Eyes!

1138
01:34:55,609 --> 01:34:57,281
Come on, we haven't got all night.

1139
01:34:57,369 --> 01:34:59,405
They stay until you come back...

1140
01:34:59,489 --> 01:35:02,003
and hand me a certain envelope, clear?

1141
01:35:02,169 --> 01:35:04,603
All right, get moving. Come on, move!

1142
01:35:10,209 --> 01:35:12,120
Get out of the way!

1143
01:35:23,289 --> 01:35:24,881
- Look out!
- Mike!

1144
01:35:36,609 --> 01:35:37,962
No! No more!

1145
01:35:53,489 --> 01:35:55,605
Danny. Come on, boy, get up.

1146
01:35:55,689 --> 01:35:57,759
Danny! It's me, Mike!

1147
01:35:59,729 --> 01:36:01,447
Come on, snap out of it.

1148
01:36:02,609 --> 01:36:05,077
Come on, Miss Diane! It's the police!

1149
01:36:07,369 --> 01:36:09,564
Mike, it's the police. We better run.

1150
01:36:09,649 --> 01:36:11,879
No, honey. We've stopped running.

1151
01:36:12,529 --> 01:36:13,928
Take care of him.

1152
01:36:14,009 --> 01:36:16,159
What's going on here?

1153
01:36:19,769 --> 01:36:22,363
How long are they gonna keep
that little kid in there?

1154
01:36:22,449 --> 01:36:24,360
Now you're concerned about the little kid.

1155
01:36:24,449 --> 01:36:25,484
I was concerned before.

1156
01:36:25,569 --> 01:36:27,958
That's why I got rattled
and reported her to welfare.

1157
01:36:28,049 --> 01:36:29,607
You got rattled.

1158
01:36:29,689 --> 01:36:31,998
I was well intended.
I wasn't trying to hurt Diane.

1159
01:36:32,089 --> 01:36:35,718
- Then why did you use her name?
- Sounded more official from a nurse.

1160
01:36:36,049 --> 01:36:39,325
Listen, I'll make it up to you.
When we go see that lieutenant...

1161
01:36:39,409 --> 01:36:40,842
let me do the talking.

1162
01:36:40,929 --> 01:36:43,966
- I noticed you're very good at it.
- It's application, that's all.

1163
01:36:44,049 --> 01:36:46,563
No mystery. Even you could do it.

1164
01:36:46,649 --> 01:36:48,048
Do me a favor.

1165
01:36:48,129 --> 01:36:49,847
Just don't help me.

1166
01:37:00,369 --> 01:37:01,882
I'm sorry, Diane.

1167
01:37:01,969 --> 01:37:03,561
- Can you forgive me?
- Of course.

1168
01:37:03,649 --> 01:37:06,038
- How about me?
- That may take a little longer.

1169
01:37:06,129 --> 01:37:08,359
Mike, they found Uncle Walter!

1170
01:37:08,449 --> 01:37:10,360
That's great, honey. I told you they would.

1171
01:37:10,449 --> 01:37:12,485
The report just came through
on the Teletype.

1172
01:37:12,569 --> 01:37:13,797
What happened? Where is he?

1173
01:37:13,889 --> 01:37:16,357
In a little emergency hospital
20 miles south of here.

1174
01:37:16,449 --> 01:37:19,521
His truck went out of control
and skidded into the Sound.

1175
01:37:19,609 --> 01:37:20,928
Is he gonna be all right?

1176
01:37:21,009 --> 01:37:24,604
They say when the bump on his head
goes down, he'll be good as new.

1177
01:37:24,969 --> 01:37:26,402
Mike, please...

1178
01:37:30,049 --> 01:37:32,563
Lieutenant, one final thing.
You, too, Miss Ettinger.

1179
01:37:32,649 --> 01:37:34,958
It concerns this sweet innocent child.

1180
01:37:35,049 --> 01:37:36,528
There's no further problem...

1181
01:37:36,609 --> 01:37:39,487
I realize you have a job to do
and rules are rules.

1182
01:37:39,569 --> 01:37:42,606
But after all, it's not as if
she were a common criminal.

1183
01:37:43,209 --> 01:37:45,848
When Sue-Lin ran away,
it was out of fear, anxiety.

1184
01:37:46,249 --> 01:37:49,002
She wanted to be with her friends,
her loved ones.

1185
01:37:49,169 --> 01:37:51,239
I take it you have a family, Lieutenant?

1186
01:37:51,329 --> 01:37:53,559
- Yes, I have.
- A wife, children.

1187
01:37:54,209 --> 01:37:57,007
- You, too, Miss Ettinger?
- I'm not married.

1188
01:37:57,969 --> 01:38:00,324
- Well, Mike, I...
- He's gone.

1189
01:38:02,929 --> 01:38:06,444
Miss Ettinger, you're supposed to be
a welfare worker. Comfort me.

1190
01:38:06,849 --> 01:38:08,999
After I return Sue-Lin to her uncle.

1191
01:38:09,089 --> 01:38:11,649
- Good-bye, Danny.
- Good-bye, Mr. Burke.

1192
01:38:16,169 --> 01:38:17,488
Thank you, Mr. Edwards.

1193
01:38:17,569 --> 01:38:20,003
We'll notify you
as soon as your application clears.

1194
01:38:20,089 --> 01:38:21,488
Thank you, sir.
