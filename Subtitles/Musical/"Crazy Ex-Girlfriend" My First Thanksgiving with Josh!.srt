00:00:01,648 --> 00:00:03,468
<i>Previously on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...</i>

2
00:00:03,493 --> 00:00:06,030
- This is Valencia. My girlfriend.
- Hi.

3
00:00:06,055 --> 00:00:08,889
<i>And exhale on an "ah..."
Hey, do you want to go grab,</i>

4
00:00:08,891 --> 00:00:11,108
- like, a coffee with me?
- Why would you want to do that?

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,776
<i>PAULA: Look, I get what
you're doing with this girl.</i>

6
00:00:12,778 --> 00:00:15,145
You befriend the enemy and you
get more face time with Josh.

7
00:00:15,147 --> 00:00:16,921
I'm so glad you moved here, Becks.

8
00:00:16,946 --> 00:00:18,732
I don't know what you're trying to do,

9
00:00:18,734 --> 00:00:20,984
or why you pretended to be my friend,

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,226
but stay away from me

11
00:00:23,664 --> 00:00:25,161
and my Josh.

12
00:00:25,163 --> 00:00:26,329
I am attracted to you.

13
00:00:27,046 --> 00:00:28,125
Very,

14
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,101
very attracted to you.

15
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:35,031
So he said "attracted,"

16
00:00:35,056 --> 00:00:36,281
but then he paused,

17
00:00:36,484 --> 00:00:38,434
and he said "very attracted."

18
00:00:38,648 --> 00:00:40,770
You mentioned that. Okay, I mentioned it

19
00:00:40,772 --> 00:00:42,475
because it's the "very," alright?

20
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,656
That's the wild card.

21
00:00:43,658 --> 00:00:46,279
"Very" is a very important
word in this, right?

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,112
Think about it. You guys have
a drink called Very Berry Blast.

23
00:00:49,114 --> 00:00:50,663
I mean... I'm assuming

24
00:00:50,665 --> 00:00:52,328
that the "very" means something. Right?

25
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:54,117
Uh, we don't name 'em. They
just come from corporate.

26
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:55,668
Okay, but that's-that's just beside...

27
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,929
beside the point.

28
00:00:56,954 --> 00:00:59,264
Maybe Josh was just trying to be nice,

29
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:00,422
like kind of...

30
00:01:00,424 --> 00:01:01,437
BOTH: blowing you off?

31
00:01:01,758 --> 00:01:02,687
What?

32
00:01:03,627 --> 00:01:04,809
No, no.

33
00:01:04,811 --> 00:01:05,609
Come on... no.

34
00:01:05,634 --> 00:01:06,883
You do talk about him a lot.

35
00:01:07,342 --> 00:01:08,851

54
00:01:41,892 --> 00:01:44,698
Look, maybe the reason
I haven't heard from Josh

55
00:01:44,723 --> 00:01:46,156
is what he said.

56
00:01:46,158 --> 00:01:47,608
It's that he's very attracted to me.

57
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,042
You know, it's like...

58
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,483
like, even if our arms brush,

59
00:01:50,508 --> 00:01:52,124
he gets a little tingle down there.

60
00:01:53,504 --> 00:01:55,597
- Hi, Becks! (growling)
- Ohhhh

61
00:01:55,622 --> 00:01:58,068
(laughing): Hey, hey, man.

62
00:01:58,093 --> 00:01:59,176
Wow, I haven't

63
00:01:59,178 --> 00:02:02,179
seen you, uh, in what, four days?

64
00:02:02,181 --> 00:02:03,563
Yeah, I'm very sorry.

65
00:02:03,565 --> 00:02:04,764
Very?

66
00:02:04,766 --> 00:02:06,716
I've been very M.I.A.

67
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:08,318
With the holidays, I'm very slammed.

68
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,270
There is very much traffic today.

69
00:02:10,272 --> 00:02:11,521
(laughs) That's funny.

70
00:02:11,523 --> 00:02:13,440
So "very" is just your go-to adverb.

71
00:02:13,442 --> 00:02:14,390
That's...

72
00:02:14,392 --> 00:02:15,892
Uh... uh, nothing.

73
00:02:15,894 --> 00:02:17,194
So you were saying?

74
00:02:17,196 --> 00:02:19,079
Yeah, we host Thanksgiving at our house

75
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:21,831
and we got cousins and
aunts and uncles pouring in

76
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,734
from Temecula, Glendale, San Mateo...

77
00:02:24,736 --> 00:02:26,402
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, Rancho Cucamonga,

78
00:02:26,404 --> 00:02:28,738
Stockton, Pismo Beach,

79
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,752
Solvang, Victorville...

80
00:02:30,777 --> 00:02:31,963
How about you?

81
00:02:31,988 --> 00:02:33,636
Well, I'm just gonna... I forgot the M's.

82
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:35,511
Uh, Modesto, Monrovia,

83
00:02:35,536 --> 00:02:37,903
Mendocino, and that's it.

84
00:02:39,223 --> 00:02:40,640
What are you doing for Thanksgiving?

85
00:02:41,222 --> 00:02:42,527
Oh, bleh...

86
00:02:42,552 --> 00:02:45,419
I just go to the East Coast,
to Scarsdale with my mom

87
00:02:45,444 --> 00:02:47,111
and we watch the World Dog Awards.

88
00:02:47,308 --> 00:02:48,707
Oh! And?

89
00:02:48,732 --> 00:02:50,481
We just roll some
Craisins in turkey slices,

90
00:02:50,506 --> 00:02:51,652
make little logs,

91
00:02:51,677 --> 00:02:53,894
- and body-shame some puppies.
- Cool!

92
00:02:53,918 --> 00:02:55,168
Most important thing, I guess,

93
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,292
is that you'll be with family.

94
00:02:56,317 --> 00:02:57,759
You know, where you belong.

95
00:02:58,152 --> 00:02:59,672
Yeah.

96
00:02:59,674 --> 00:03:01,355
Yeah, where I...

97
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,829
where I belong.

98
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:06,045
And I put the boba on
the side for Aunt Dhori.

99
00:03:06,047 --> 00:03:07,892
We know she likes to
pop 'em with her hand.

100
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:10,099
Thanks, guys. Have the best
Thanksgiving, Becks.

101
00:03:10,101 --> 00:03:11,486
Give your mother my very best.

102
00:03:11,511 --> 00:03:12,896
See you guys!

103
00:03:12,921 --> 00:03:14,036
- Have a good one.
- Peace!

104
00:03:14,378 --> 00:03:16,121
Very peace!

105
00:03:16,658 --> 00:03:18,624
(baby coos)

106
00:03:18,626 --> 00:03:20,076
MAN: Okay, everybody ready?

107
00:03:20,078 --> 00:03:22,044
- Say "cheese."
- ALL: Cheese.

108
00:03:22,046 --> 00:03:23,246
That's good.

109
00:03:23,248 --> 00:03:24,797
(indistinct chatter)

110
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,916
<i>REBECCA: Everyone
belongs somewhere but me.</i>

111
00:03:26,918 --> 00:03:28,217
That's silly, honey.

112
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:29,952
You've got family back home in New York.

113
00:03:29,954 --> 00:03:31,521
I mean, not really.

114
00:03:31,523 --> 00:03:33,660
My dad bailed, my mom's a misery,

115
00:03:33,685 --> 00:03:35,566
I ate my twin in the womb.

116
00:03:36,344 --> 00:03:38,511
I really don't want to
go home for the holiday.

117
00:03:38,513 --> 00:03:40,199
It's the last place I want to be.

118
00:03:40,224 --> 00:03:41,807
Like I said, you are more than welcome

119
00:03:41,832 --> 00:03:43,849
to my apocalypse of a Thanksgiving.

120
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:45,995
Yeah... I mean, pull up a chair

121
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,570
and enjoy Scott's racist uncle.

122
00:03:47,572 --> 00:03:49,305
You ate your twin?

123
00:03:49,307 --> 00:03:51,157
I mean, medically
speaking, I didn't "eat" it,

124
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:53,769
I just metabolized its
body parts for my own use.

125
00:03:56,313 --> 00:03:57,580
Why don't you ask Josh if you can go

126
00:03:57,582 --> 00:03:58,800
to his house for Thanksgiving?

127
00:03:58,825 --> 00:04:00,838
He said he's "very attracted" to you,

128
00:04:00,863 --> 00:04:02,175
and we know what that means.

129
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,542
Oh, God, don't even get me started.

130
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:05,204
I don't even know what that means anymore.

131
00:04:05,206 --> 00:04:06,214
I do.

132
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,184
A guy says something like that,

133
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:09,542
it means his current relationship

134
00:04:09,544 --> 00:04:11,010
is about ready to bite the dust.

135
00:04:11,012 --> 00:04:12,638
He's putting out feelers.

136
00:04:13,058 --> 00:04:15,181
If you could go to his
house for the holiday...

137
00:04:15,886 --> 00:04:16,682
(sighs)

138
00:04:16,684 --> 00:04:18,816
I mean, would I like to go to the Chan's?

139
00:04:19,707 --> 00:04:21,854
Would I like to be surrounded

140
00:04:21,856 --> 00:04:24,792
by the unconditional love
of a hundred Filipinos?

141
00:04:25,944 --> 00:04:27,560
Of course I would.

142
00:04:27,562 --> 00:04:28,844
Tell us the story!

143
00:04:28,846 --> 00:04:30,730
The library book story! Again?

144
00:04:30,777 --> 00:04:32,865
Well, no, I couldn't possibly.

145
00:04:32,867 --> 00:04:35,017
(chanting): Library book story!

146
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:36,869
Library book story!

147
00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:40,623
Library book story! Library book story!

148
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,125
Please, Miss Rebecca, just one more time.

149
00:04:43,127 --> 00:04:44,917
The library book story.

150
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:47,713
But you know it by heart by now.

151
00:04:47,715 --> 00:04:50,207
Well, all right.

152
00:04:50,878 --> 00:04:52,449
But if Josh was going to invite me,

153
00:04:52,474 --> 00:04:53,970
he would've asked and he didn't,

154
00:04:53,972 --> 00:04:55,371
so just drop it.

155
00:04:55,373 --> 00:04:57,373
Why do you always give up so easily?

156
00:04:57,832 --> 00:05:00,226
<i>Do you think Angelina
went into Mr. & Mrs. Smith</i>

157
00:05:00,228 --> 00:05:01,691
with that kind of attitude?

158
00:05:01,913 --> 00:05:03,296
If she had, no Shiloh,

159
00:05:03,321 --> 00:05:04,857
no Maddox, no Vivienne...

160
00:05:05,246 --> 00:05:07,408
Who do you think belongs next to him

161
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:09,697
and that turkey on Thursday?

162
00:05:09,722 --> 00:05:11,488
You or Venezuela?

163
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,417
You know what? Thanksgiving
is a beautiful family holiday.

164
00:05:14,442 --> 00:05:16,192
Not gonna let you ruin
it with your scheming.

165
00:05:16,194 --> 00:05:18,244
Okay, okay... Let's put it this way.

166
00:05:18,246 --> 00:05:20,229
Say a giant boulder ran
over Josh's girlfriend

167
00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:22,114
and she was out of the picture.

168
00:05:22,675 --> 00:05:23,616
How would you feel?

169
00:05:23,618 --> 00:05:25,084
I mean, I'd feel terrible!

170
00:05:25,086 --> 00:05:26,836
Okay? A boulder would decimate her

171
00:05:26,838 --> 00:05:28,404
and her guts would be everywhere.

172
00:05:29,191 --> 00:05:30,456
Okay, wow.

173
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:32,458
Rebecca,

174
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,909
you are getting close to Josh.

175
00:05:33,911 --> 00:05:35,175
I can feel it.

176
00:05:35,413 --> 00:05:37,150
And if you could just get
into that turkey dinner,

177
00:05:37,175 --> 00:05:39,265
you would be set.

178
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:42,184
It's the holidays, Paula.

179
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,377
People don't always get what they want.

180
00:05:49,592 --> 00:05:51,310

00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,026
Paula's joking.

362
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,017
My parents aren't dead.

363
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:23,685
They're just abandoning and frigid, so...

364
00:12:23,687 --> 00:12:24,931
I see.

365
00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:26,965
That's also very terrible.

366
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,473
- Exactly.
- Uh, guess so.

367
00:12:28,475 --> 00:12:30,492
I mean, I would ask
her to come to my house,

368
00:12:30,494 --> 00:12:32,376
but we're going to Paris.

369
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:34,246
'Cause that's where we autumn.

370
00:12:34,248 --> 00:12:36,782
It's like wintering but cheaper.

371
00:12:37,032 --> 00:12:38,333
Aw, Rebecca!

372
00:12:38,335 --> 00:12:40,652
You shouldn't be alone on Thanksgiving.

373
00:12:40,962 --> 00:12:43,755
Why don't you come over and
spend the holiday with us?

374
00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:46,392
Josh will be so thrilled.

375
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,927
Oh... um...

376
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:51,096
I would love that.

377
00:12:51,098 --> 00:12:52,134
Yeah.

378
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:54,874
That's so generous of you.

379
00:12:54,914 --> 00:12:56,336
I would be honored.

380
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,519
What can I bring?

381
00:12:57,521 --> 00:13:00,338
Oh, just bring your appetite, my dear.

382
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,506
See you tomorrow.

383
00:13:01,508 --> 00:13:03,442
Okay, thank you so much again. Bye.

384
00:13:03,444 --> 00:13:05,527
Bye!

385
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:07,312
Whoa! Whoa!

386
00:13:07,314 --> 00:13:09,281
I'm actually going to...
Wait... a real Thanksgiving

387
00:13:09,283 --> 00:13:11,233
- with a real family?!
- I know.

388
00:13:11,235 --> 00:13:12,868
Wait, oh, no, wait.

389
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,202
What's Josh gonna think

390
00:13:14,204 --> 00:13:15,954
when I just show up to his house randomly?

391
00:13:15,956 --> 00:13:17,489
Yeah, we're gonna find out in a second.

392
00:13:17,491 --> 00:13:19,126
She's texting him right now.

393
00:13:22,128 --> 00:13:24,290
(phone chimes)

394
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:31,368
_

395
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:33,054
You're an evil genius.

396
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:34,257
Uh-huh, yeah.

397
00:13:34,282 --> 00:13:35,132
You're welcome.

398
00:13:35,157 --> 00:13:36,520
Welcome to the fam-bam.

399
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:52,149
(door closes)

400
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,340
Dad, what is this...
A heart-attack buffet?

401
00:13:58,342 --> 00:14:00,209
Get off my ass, Greg. It's a holiday.

402
00:14:00,211 --> 00:14:02,261
I'm enjoying the things
that make life worthwhile.

403
00:14:02,263 --> 00:14:04,596
Hey, hey, hey, hey, that's
for Sinatra and Tormé.

404
00:14:04,598 --> 00:14:07,156
By all means, serve the
high-end food to your macaws.

405
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:08,934
It's not enough that you
let them crap in the shower.

406
00:14:08,936 --> 00:14:10,126
I'm training them.

407
00:14:10,151 --> 00:14:11,553
Dad, all I'm saying is, if you're gonna go

408
00:14:11,555 --> 00:14:12,671
through the trouble to train them,

409
00:14:12,673 --> 00:14:14,223
train them to use the toilet.

410
00:14:14,225 --> 00:14:15,867
Oh, that's a good
idea... they're birds.

411
00:14:15,892 --> 00:14:17,734
Maybe I should train
them to wipe their ass.

412
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:18,708
(laughs)

413
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,001
(coughing)

414
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,192
Do you need the oxygen tank?

415
00:14:21,217 --> 00:14:22,688
No, no, no, no. Stop it.

416
00:14:23,688 --> 00:14:25,251
Why you bothering me?

417
00:14:25,487 --> 00:14:27,126
Isn't there some girl you
could be trying to bang?

418
00:14:27,151 --> 00:14:30,203
Oh, what about that, that
crazy girl you met at the party?

419
00:14:30,722 --> 00:14:32,024
The one from the taco festival?

420
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:33,559
Why do I tell you anything?

421
00:14:33,584 --> 00:14:34,800
Oh, right, I was drunk.

422
00:14:35,266 --> 00:14:36,462
That girl's not for me, Dad.

423
00:14:36,487 --> 00:14:38,017
- Trust me, Dad, listen.
- Sure.

424
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:39,079
Listen to me.

425
00:14:39,104 --> 00:14:40,970
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

426
00:14:41,636 --> 00:14:44,304
Some, um, changes I want to make.

427
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:45,353
Me, too.

428
00:14:46,054 --> 00:14:47,987
I'm thinking about a third macaw.

429
00:14:48,122 --> 00:14:50,360
I'm thinking Bennett for Tony Bennett.

430
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,685
(laughs)

431
00:14:54,097 --> 00:14:55,597
Oh, so serious.

432
00:14:55,747 --> 00:14:56,696
What is it?

433
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:01,085
Tell me. (coughing)

434
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,635
I'll get the tank.

435
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,853
Yep, yep... ah.

436
00:15:07,025 --> 00:15:08,559
MAN: So you want to speak Tagalog,

437
00:15:08,584 --> 00:15:10,095
the mother tongue of the Philippines.

438
00:15:10,757 --> 00:15:11,990
Let's start with "Hello."

439
00:15:12,156 --> 00:15:13,956
<i>Mabuhay... say it with me.</i>

440
00:15:14,192 --> 00:15:15,610
<i>BOTH: Mabuhay.</i>

441
00:15:15,635 --> 00:15:16,901
"Nice to meet you."

442
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,767
<i>BOTH: Natutwa akong makilala kayo.</i>

443
00:15:21,635 --> 00:15:25,136
Okay, I know I'm forgetting something.

444
00:15:25,696 --> 00:15:26,862
(gasps)

445
00:15:26,887 --> 00:15:28,712
Whoa! Ooh!

446
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:33,517
_

447
00:15:34,197 --> 00:15:38,282
_

448
00:15:38,307 --> 00:15:39,915
<i>No, okay.</i>

449
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,517
_

450
00:15:45,087 --> 00:15:49,938
_

451
00:15:54,638 --> 00:15:55,923
(knocking)

452
00:15:55,948 --> 00:15:57,480
PAULA: Heya!

453
00:15:58,149 --> 00:16:00,220
Whew, something smells weird in here.

454
00:16:00,245 --> 00:16:02,735
Oh, uh, well, it's a Filipino dish

455
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,708
called dinuguan... it consists
of pork cooked in pork's blood.

456
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:06,540
Do you want to try some?

457
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,865
Uh, thanks, but I think

458
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,438
I'm all full up from the wonderful smell.

459
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:12,679
You know what? That's just

460
00:16:12,704 --> 00:16:14,610
your culturally insensitive
taste buds talking.

461
00:16:14,635 --> 00:16:16,298
Okay, I can only stay for a second.

462
00:16:16,323 --> 00:16:18,106
I'm making pies for people that I hate.

463
00:16:18,238 --> 00:16:22,040
Which is mixed emotions
for me, because I like pie.

464
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,549
Okay.

465
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,556
As discussed, here it is.

466
00:16:25,581 --> 00:16:30,118
This brooch contains a small
video camera and microphone.

467
00:16:30,143 --> 00:16:32,093
It's exactly like the teddy bear nanny cam

468
00:16:32,118 --> 00:16:33,931
that we used in the Gatwick
divorce, but with audio.

469
00:16:33,956 --> 00:16:36,573
No... So it will transmit everything

470
00:16:36,598 --> 00:16:38,923
you see and hear directly
to an app on my phone,

471
00:16:38,948 --> 00:16:41,274
so I will not miss any of your triumph.

472
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:42,204
(laughs)

473
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:45,157
This isn't weird, right? Is it weird?

474
00:16:45,774 --> 00:16:46,767
No.

475
00:16:46,792 --> 00:16:48,149
Okay, cool.

476
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,485
I got to go, but I cannot wait

477
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,678

00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:58,026
Yeah, you really should.

719
00:25:58,172 --> 00:26:00,619
- Valencia.
- What? She wants to go.

720
00:26:00,621 --> 00:26:02,804
Well, good-bye.

721
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:05,257
Bye, Jayma. Bye, Jastenity.

722
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:07,006
Wait, Rebecca.

723
00:26:07,031 --> 00:26:09,428
Would you join our family for mass?

724
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,812
We'd love to have you.

725
00:26:11,032 --> 00:26:13,180
Um, she's Jewish.

726
00:26:14,251 --> 00:26:17,430
I would be so honored,
Mrs. Chan, thank you.

727
00:26:17,774 --> 00:26:19,154
Wow, can I just say,

728
00:26:19,156 --> 00:26:21,969
you have made me feel like I truly belong.

729
00:26:23,172 --> 00:26:25,077
Oh, of course you do.

730
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:27,913
Great, I'll also join for mass

731
00:26:27,915 --> 00:26:30,492
because I actually believe in Jesus.

732
00:26:30,701 --> 00:26:32,150
(chuckling): Knock yourself out.

733
00:26:32,152 --> 00:26:33,818
It's a public place of worship.

734
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:34,695
(stomach gurgling)

735
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,414
Uh, where is your powder
room really quickly?

736
00:26:37,617 --> 00:26:39,392
Oh, it's just down the hall, sweetie.

737
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,009
Okay... thank you.

738
00:26:41,011 --> 00:26:42,260
I'll be right...

739
00:26:42,731 --> 00:26:44,965
Thanks. (stomach gurgling)

740
00:26:45,491 --> 00:26:47,793
(speaks indistinctly)

741
00:26:49,143 --> 00:26:51,328
(cell phone ringing)

742
00:26:53,391 --> 00:26:54,890
(whispering): Hey. Hey, Paula.

743
00:26:54,892 --> 00:26:57,526
Hey, cookie, you are crushing it!

744
00:26:57,528 --> 00:26:59,227
Yeah, I know, it's going so well.

745
00:26:59,229 --> 00:27:00,345
Okay, listen.

746
00:27:00,347 --> 00:27:01,897
I have to go to the bathroom,

747
00:27:01,899 --> 00:27:03,315
(door slams) but I will call you...

748
00:27:03,317 --> 00:27:04,849
Wait-wait, wait-wait,
wait, hold on.

749
00:27:04,851 --> 00:27:06,368
Hold on. Hold it, somebody's here.

750
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,736
Oh, crap.

751
00:27:07,738 --> 00:27:09,953
I really have to poo-poo. Okay, hold on.

752
00:27:10,157 --> 00:27:12,457
VALENCIA: I'm so... I try so
hard to be nice to your mom,

753
00:27:12,459 --> 00:27:14,242
and all she ever gives me is stink face.

754
00:27:14,244 --> 00:27:15,256
Hold on, shh, shh, shh.

755
00:27:15,281 --> 00:27:16,553
Josh: Babe, babe, babe,
she-she loves you.

756
00:27:16,578 --> 00:27:18,046
And you just stood there doing nothing

757
00:27:18,048 --> 00:27:19,965
while she sucked up to
everyone like a vacuum cleaner.

758
00:27:19,967 --> 00:27:21,383
(gasps) Come on, Rebecca
was just being nice.

759
00:27:21,385 --> 00:27:22,968
- It's Josh and Valencia.
- Nice?!

760
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,869
VALENCIA: So naive, Josh!

761
00:27:24,871 --> 00:27:26,888
You don't see who she really is.

762
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:29,413
(gasps) They're fighting.

763
00:27:29,927 --> 00:27:32,210
It's so sad.

764
00:27:32,212 --> 00:27:34,062
Oh, my God, I can hear it.

765
00:27:34,064 --> 00:27:35,414
You didn't even sit next to me.

766
00:27:35,439 --> 00:27:37,506
I told you I wanted to
be closer to the turkey.

767
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:38,830
I like the skin!

768
00:27:38,855 --> 00:27:40,555
PAULA: I can hear it. Why
don't you stick up for me?

769
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,437
Oh, my God, this is
it... this is the boulder.

770
00:27:42,439 --> 00:27:43,939
Wait-wait, wait, wait,
wait, shh, shh, shh.

771
00:27:43,941 --> 00:27:45,357
Wait, wait, I can't hear.

772
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:46,656
Wait.

773
00:27:47,394 --> 00:27:48,276
It's gone quiet.

774
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,750
What happened?

775
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:51,618
Did she kill him?

776
00:27:51,643 --> 00:27:53,643
(mattress springs squeak rhythmically)

777
00:27:55,151 --> 00:27:56,619
What is that sound?

778
00:27:57,086 --> 00:27:59,313
Wait, I don't know.

779
00:28:00,602 --> 00:28:02,242
Maybe it's a tiny trampoline.

780
00:28:03,758 --> 00:28:05,761
Or a ghost with a rusty knee?

781
00:28:06,453 --> 00:28:08,046
- (Valencia moans) 
- Oh, my God, Rebecca, are they...?

782
00:28:08,048 --> 00:28:10,248
(Josh and Valencia moaning)

783
00:28:11,134 --> 00:28:12,467
Oh, no.

784
00:28:12,469 --> 00:28:14,770
- (Valencia moans) 
- JOSH: Oh, yeah.

785
00:28:19,953 --> 00:28:21,422
Run out of the room.

786
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,963
Just sprint by their
writhing bodies and escape.

787
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,436
(stomach gurgling) No, no-no, I can't.

788
00:28:24,438 --> 00:28:26,387
Because if I move, my bowels will explode.

789
00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:28,273
Like, all over the walls.

790
00:28:28,275 --> 00:28:30,391
Wait, shh, shh, shh. Shh,
I think they've stopped.

791
00:28:30,393 --> 00:28:32,938
I think they stopped, hold on, hold on.

792
00:28:33,189 --> 00:28:35,056
(bed resumes squeaking)
(Josh and Valencia moaning)

793
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:38,820
Oh, God, the stamina.

794
00:28:39,108 --> 00:28:41,108
Why won't this end?

795
00:28:44,986 --> 00:28:47,154
When is this gonna end?

796
00:28:52,138 --> 00:28:53,195
Huh.

797
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:56,289

Yes. Yes.

00:32:19,267 --> 00:32:20,399
Okay, they're gone.

847
00:32:20,424 --> 00:32:21,923
Go to the bathroom, honey.

848
00:32:21,925 --> 00:32:23,391
No. I'm gonna make a run for it

849
00:32:23,393 --> 00:32:24,676
because I can't be in
this house any longer.

850
00:32:24,678 --> 00:32:25,960
Are you crazy?

851
00:32:25,962 --> 00:32:27,462
You'll never make it!

852
00:32:27,527 --> 00:32:28,743
You will never make it.

853
00:32:28,768 --> 00:32:32,236
(stomach gurgling)

854
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:44,112
There you are!

855
00:32:44,572 --> 00:32:45,558
Ready for church

856
00:32:45,854 --> 00:32:47,482
You know, I really want to go,

857
00:32:47,484 --> 00:32:49,484
but I have to take a
giant... (stomach gurgling)

858
00:32:50,072 --> 00:32:50,919
rain check.

859
00:32:51,088 --> 00:32:52,775
(clinking)

860
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,832
Everyone...

861
00:32:53,834 --> 00:32:55,362
I have an announcement to make.

862
00:32:55,603 --> 00:32:57,096
Today has been a special day.

863
00:32:57,121 --> 00:32:59,038
So nice to see everyone here

864
00:32:59,063 --> 00:33:00,429
from, you know, Rancho Cucamonga,

865
00:33:00,454 --> 00:33:02,787
and Stockton, Monrovia,

866
00:33:02,812 --> 00:33:03,928
Victorville...

867
00:33:03,953 --> 00:33:05,619
Yeah, all the places!

868
00:33:05,644 --> 00:33:07,611
JOSH: I'm so thankful
for the wonderful meal

869
00:33:07,673 --> 00:33:09,205
and for, you know,

870
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,221
sharing great laughs, as
always. (stomach gurgling)

871
00:33:11,692 --> 00:33:14,926
But there were also
some challenging moments.

872
00:33:15,385 --> 00:33:17,252
Those moments are really important, too.

873
00:33:17,277 --> 00:33:19,627
Because of those moments,

874
00:33:20,127 --> 00:33:21,533
we find out what really matters

875
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:24,426
and are reminded where we belong.

876
00:33:24,832 --> 00:33:26,465
And I belong...

877
00:33:27,653 --> 00:33:28,924
with Valencia.

878
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,166
On that note,

879
00:33:33,191 --> 00:33:36,052
and in front of the people I love the most

880
00:33:36,077 --> 00:33:37,822
and who love me the most...

881
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:42,021
V, I want to ask you something.

882
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,643
(quiet murmuring)

883
00:33:44,935 --> 00:33:46,318
Valencia...

884
00:33:48,591 --> 00:33:50,318
will you move in with me? (gasps)

885
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,587
I do!

886
00:33:52,612 --> 00:33:54,395
I mean, I will.

887
00:33:54,749 --> 00:33:58,654
No... No...

888
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,104
Now, who wants to go see Jesus?

889
00:34:05,386 --> 00:34:07,247
(laughter)

890
00:34:11,943 --> 00:34:14,721
(TV plays indistinctly)

891
00:34:14,746 --> 00:34:16,473
Hey. Hey.

892
00:34:16,498 --> 00:34:18,198
I brought your robe. I know you hate

893
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,842
that these hospital gowns
leave your ass hanging out.

894
00:34:19,867 --> 00:34:21,943
My ass will hang out when I say it should.

895
00:34:22,085 --> 00:34:24,028
I am the captain of my own ass.

896
00:34:24,138 --> 00:34:25,974
(both laugh)

897
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,293
- I know what you did.
- What?

898
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:30,632
(scoffs)

899
00:34:30,806 --> 00:34:32,606
One of the nurses ratted you out.

900
00:34:33,652 --> 00:34:35,112
You spent all your savings?

901
00:34:35,472 --> 00:34:36,325
On me?

902
00:34:36,443 --> 00:34:38,404
(laughing): Why?

903
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:39,840
I'm a lost cause.

904
00:34:39,865 --> 00:34:41,097
Run, like your mother did.

905
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:42,315
Save yourself.

906
00:34:42,568 --> 00:34:43,933
And-and the macaws.

907
00:34:44,138 --> 00:34:45,535
You need those treatments.

908
00:34:45,537 --> 00:34:47,871
You gotta go to school. Move out.

909
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,656
It's-it's time.

910
00:34:49,658 --> 00:34:51,107
Don't you tell me what to do.

911
00:34:51,109 --> 00:34:53,109
I make my own decisions,
thank you very much,

912
00:34:53,111 --> 00:34:55,044
and I'm not going anywhere, sorry.

913
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:57,724
- Now...
- Don't, don't... fight me on this.

914
00:34:57,749 --> 00:34:59,810
Look at you, old man,

915
00:34:59,835 --> 00:35:01,513
you'd lose.

916
00:35:02,673 --> 00:35:04,513
You have tubes in your face.

917
00:35:04,723 --> 00:35:06,339
You know what my father would've done

918
00:35:06,341 --> 00:35:07,600
if I talked to him like that?

919
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,559
He probably would've said,

920
00:35:09,561 --> 00:35:11,477
"Thank you for saving my life, son."

921
00:35:11,479 --> 00:35:12,864
(laughing): Yeah, probably.

922
00:35:12,889 --> 00:35:14,139
My father was a saint.

923
00:35:14,164 --> 00:35:16,080
(both laugh)

924
00:35:16,184 --> 00:35:18,735
Now, hey... get out of here.

925
00:35:18,918 --> 00:35:21,131
And get yourself something to eat,

926
00:35:21,156 --> 00:35:22,572
something decent to eat.

927
00:35:22,574 --> 00:35:23,806
The food here is garbage.

928
00:35:23,808 --> 00:35:25,474
I will, in a bit.

929
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:26,419
I'm not in a hurry.

930
00:35:27,812 --> 00:35:29,979
(TV plays indistinctly)

931
00:35:30,804 --> 00:35:32,271
I love you, you know.

932
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,534
Almost as much as Sinatra,

933
00:35:34,536 --> 00:35:36,502
and he's a damned good bird.

934
00:35:38,923 --> 00:35:40,623
(chuckles) Oh, no, no, no.

935
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:41,925
- Change that.
- No, no. I don't...

936
00:35:41,927 --> 00:35:43,843
The beach volleyball, come on.

937
00:35:43,845 --> 00:35:45,345
- I don't need...
- Oh, look at, look at that.

938
00:35:45,347 --> 00:35:46,763
La, la, la, la. Oh, Brazil!

939
00:35:46,765 --> 00:35:48,631
La, la, la, la. Oh, go, baby, go.

940
00:35:50,935 --> 00:35:52,886
You can make it, you can
make it, you can make it...

941
00:35:52,888 --> 00:35:54,520
PAULA: You can do it, baby.

942
00:35:54,522 --> 00:35:56,005
You can make it. Just don't think about it.

943
00:35:56,007 --> 00:35:57,807
Oh, thank God...

944
00:35:57,809 --> 00:36:00,360
Oh... oh...

945
00:36:01,511 --> 00:36:03,062
Paula, come on.

946
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:04,543
Enough with that.

947
00:36:08,904 --> 00:36:11,882
So, this is our first Thanksgiving

948
00:36:12,466 --> 00:36:13,550
without Aunt Judy.

949
00:36:14,169 --> 00:36:15,364
Let's, uh...

950
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,677
have a moment of silence for her.

951
00:36:18,914 --> 00:36:20,614
REBECCA: Why...?

952
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,704
Because she's dead.

953
00:36:22,918 --> 00:36:25,468
(snoring)

954
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:30,473
(knocking at door)

955
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,841
Hey, Paula!

956
00:36:31,843 --> 00:36:33,059
Come in. (door opens)

957
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:34,811
Oh, I think my spleen is somewhere

958
00:36:34,813 --> 00:36:36,896
in the municipal sewer system.

959
00:36:36,939 --> 00:36:38,388
(door closes)

960
00:36:38,516 --> 00:36:40,433
Oh...

961
00:36:40,435 --> 00:36:44,320
Oh... my butthole's the gateway to hell.

962
00:36:44,322 --> 00:36:46,155
(moaning)

963
00:36:46,157 --> 00:36:48,074
- You look great.
- Hi!

964
00:36:48,076 --> 00:36:49,525
What are you doing here?

965
00:36:50,169 --> 00:36:51,194
You promised me a drink.

966
00:36:51,196 --> 00:36:52,395
I got tired of waiting.

967
00:36:52,397 --> 00:36:54,247
Okay. So you just showed up?

968
00:36:54,249 --> 00:36:56,249
And, like, phones don't exist?

969
00:36:56,251 --> 00:36:58,234
I decided we're past courtesy.

970
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:01,237
I brought
tacos and tequila,

971
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:03,339
the food of our forefathers.

972
00:37:03,818 --> 00:37:05,591
Well, not really yours. Or mine.

973
00:37:05,593 --> 00:37:07,710
That's really nice.

974
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:10,346
But, God, I'm not really in a position

975
00:37:10,348 --> 00:37:11,714
to eat that stuff right now.

976
00:37:11,716 --> 00:37:13,182
I've had the worst Thanksgiving ever.

977
00:37:13,184 --> 00:37:14,767
Yeah, mine was really bad, too.

978
00:37:14,769 --> 00:37:17,253
<i>It was like Pearl Harbor
meets the movie Pearl Harbor.</i>

979
00:37:17,255 --> 00:37:19,389
(laughs) That's funny.

980
00:37:19,724 --> 00:37:20,723
Well, feel free

981
00:37:20,725 --> 00:37:22,859
to sit down, but I gotta warn you,

982
00:37:22,861 --> 00:37:24,143
I'm not good company.

983
00:37:24,145 --> 00:37:25,144
That's okay. I'm used to it.

984
00:37:25,146 --> 00:37:27,730
Ha, ha, ha! (laughs evilly)

985
00:37:27,732 --> 00:37:29,265
You know what? Maybe I
will have some tequila.

986
00:37:29,267 --> 00:37:30,533
Yeah. (stomach gurgling)

987
00:37:30,535 --> 00:37:32,735
Oh, no, no, no. Not tacos, though.

988
00:37:32,737 --> 00:37:35,371
Not gonna handle those tacos right now.

989
00:37:35,373 --> 00:37:37,290
Here, let me get you a
plate to eat the tacos on,

990
00:37:37,292 --> 00:37:38,941
because you're a person.

991
00:37:38,943 --> 00:37:40,209
(stomach gurgling)

992
00:37:40,211 --> 00:37:41,958
Uh-oh. Oh, God.

993
00:37:41,983 --> 00:37:43,879
Oh, no...

994
00:37:43,904 --> 00:37:46,287
- Where are you... going?
- Okay, okay, okay.

995
00:37:46,334 --> 00:37:48,784
I'll be back, I'll be back.
Clench, Becky. Clench, Becky.

996
00:37:48,786 --> 00:37:50,303
You can do it. Okay.

997
00:37:50,305 --> 00:37:52,638
Okay, Becky.

998
00:37:53,132 --> 00:37:54,224
(door closes)

999
00:38:00,138 --> 00:38:01,958
Let's see what's on my queue.

1000
00:38:01,983 --> 00:38:02,935
No.

1001
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,827
Mm... no. Sorry you
had to see that.

1002
00:38:04,852 --> 00:38:07,853
Ooh! Documentary about a
whale that didn't have parents.

1003
00:38:07,878 --> 00:38:09,482
Mm. Mm-hmm.

1004
00:38:09,507 --> 00:38:11,056
That says Thanksgiving.

1005
00:38:12,479 --> 00:38:15,798
So... how'd your dad take the news?

1006
00:38:16,959 --> 00:38:18,209
Oh, yeah, that didn't happen.

1007
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,596
Really? He asked you to stay?

1008
00:38:21,372 --> 00:38:22,797
Nah, it's just...

1009
00:38:23,216 --> 00:38:24,427
The thing is,

1010
00:38:25,615 --> 00:38:27,699
he's always been there for me,

1011
00:38:27,724 --> 00:38:28,708
my whole life.

1012
00:38:30,778 --> 00:38:32,286
The only person, actually.

1013
00:38:33,985 --> 00:38:35,004
God...

1014
00:38:36,302 --> 00:38:37,794
it's nice that you have that.

1015
00:38:38,127 --> 00:38:39,560
'Cause not everyone does.

1016
00:38:42,598 --> 00:38:43,504
That whale didn't.

1017
00:38:43,825 --> 00:38:45,603
No. (chuckles)

1018
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:47,190
Have you thought about night school?

1019
00:38:47,997 --> 00:38:49,725
Yeah. It's funny you say that.

1020
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,194
I have been thinking about it.

1021
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:52,895
Do it!

1022
00:38:54,271 --> 00:38:55,686
Maybe I will.

1023
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:56,927
Okay.

1024
00:38:58,107 --> 00:38:59,252
Why does Netflix always want me

1025
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,872
<i>to watch Leaving Las Vegas?</i>

1026
00:39:01,568 --> 00:39:03,122
What are they trying to tell me?

1027
00:39:03,124 --> 00:39:04,591
(gasps) Wait.

1028
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:06,513
I know exactly what we should watch.

1029
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:09,078
(clicking)

1030
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,714
There. I saved you the pork adobo

1031
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,416
<i>and the turkey skin, Anak.</i>

1032
00:39:13,418 --> 00:39:14,739
Thanks, Mom.

1033
00:39:14,764 --> 00:39:16,531
Hey, that was a great sermon, huh?

1034
00:39:16,556 --> 00:39:18,474
Perfect combination of guilt and...

1035
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,457
No, I guess it was just guilt.

1036
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:22,792
VALENCIA: I wasn't even paying attention.

1037
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:25,417
I was just... so happy.

1038
00:39:25,442 --> 00:39:26,706
(giggling)

1039
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:28,865
- (both laughing)
- I'm going to bed.

1040
00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:30,412
All I ask is

1041
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:33,987
if you're going to go against
the church and live in sin,

1042
00:39:33,989 --> 00:39:36,888
be consistent and use contraception, okay?

1043
00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:38,458
(sighs)

1044
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,742
(humming)

1045
00:39:40,165 --> 00:39:42,199
Thanks, Mom. Good night.

1046
00:39:42,727 --> 00:39:44,865
You want to hear something funny?

1047
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:47,617
You want to know who I'm
most thankful for today?

1048
00:39:48,966 --> 00:39:50,003
Rebecca.

1049
00:39:50,005 --> 00:39:51,716
What? Why?

1050
00:39:51,923 --> 00:39:54,138
But don't get me wrong. She's
the worst and I hate her.

1051
00:39:54,491 --> 00:39:56,407
But if it wasn't for us fighting about her,

1052
00:39:56,682 --> 00:39:58,549
we wouldn't be moving in together!

1053
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,379
(both laughing)

1054
00:40:00,404 --> 00:40:02,786
So, which part of town should we live in?

1055
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:05,602
- Uh, I haven't thought about it yet.
- Well, I have,

1056
00:40:05,604 --> 00:40:08,271
because I have my eye on
a duplex on South Cameron

1057
00:40:08,273 --> 00:40:10,189
with a backyard and shutters

1058
00:40:10,191 --> 00:40:14,255
and French doors and Spanish
tile and an orange tree.

1059
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,696
It has two bedrooms,
which would be perfect,

1060
00:40:16,698 --> 00:40:19,544
because I need the extra
room to practice my Ashtanga.

1061
00:40:22,497 --> 00:40:26,039
REBECCA (sighs): The World Dog Awards.

1062
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:28,257
(barking on TV) Now that says Thanksgiving.

1063
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,710
I hate to say it, but that bloodhound

1064
00:40:30,712 --> 00:40:32,629
could definitely benefit
from a juice cleanse.

1065
00:40:32,631 --> 00:40:34,430
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
- Whoa.

1066
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,516
Yes, that is one portly puppy.

1067
00:40:36,911 --> 00:40:37,934
Mm.

1068
00:40:37,998 --> 00:40:40,231
Oh, here.

1069
00:40:42,443 --> 00:40:43,640
Here you go.

1070
00:40:43,829 --> 00:40:45,802
- No one likes a hot butt.
- (barking on TV)

1071
00:40:48,591 --> 00:40:49,845
Hmm.

1072
00:40:51,288 --> 00:40:53,590
Oh, my God, I can't
believe I'm eating again.

1073
00:40:53,615 --> 00:40:55,931
Yeah, I was gonna say,
speaking of portly puppies.

1074
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,954
- Woof! Woof!
- That's not nice. That's not nice.

1075
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,039
- Woof! Woof! Woof!
- You've lost your pillow privileges.

1076
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:02,964
- Ooh, ooh, giant pillow!
- No! That's unfair!

1077
00:41:02,989 --> 00:41:04,293
(Greg laughing)

1078
00:41:04,404 --> 00:41:06,571
Oh.

1079
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:10,883
No! Not Greg. Josh! Josh!

1080
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,535
(sighs)

1081
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:14,333
I worked so hard for nothing!

1082
00:41:15,489 --> 00:41:17,340
<i>GIRL: Another story, Miss Rebecca.</i>

1083
00:41:17,794 --> 00:41:20,309
'Twas the night of the
Dunster House Formal.

1084
00:41:20,513 --> 00:41:22,395
The place? Harvard.

1085
00:41:22,685 --> 00:41:25,380
The year? 2008.

1086
00:41:25,717 --> 00:41:27,483
I remember it specifically

1087
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,185
because I had a Barack Obama bobble-head

1088
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:30,486
perched on my nightstand.

1089
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:32,221
And as I was being rhythmically trashed

1090
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:34,884
by a junior visiting from
the Brown improv troupe,

1091
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,777
the bobble-head nodded
up and down as if to say,

1092
00:41:37,779 --> 00:41:41,527
"Yes, yes, you have made
another terrible decision,

1093
00:41:41,552 --> 00:41:43,135
you silly, weak woman."

1094
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,607
- (shrieking): Mommy!
- I was out of stories!

1095
