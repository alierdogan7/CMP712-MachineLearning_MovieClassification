1
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,306
You are a very sad man,
Mr. Kent.

2
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:44,239
Nothing gets me down, sugar.

3
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,973
Put your hands on the ice...
next to mine.

4
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,310
Just a second.

5
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,782
Stand behind me.
For moral support.

6
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,250
My other pocket's lonely.

7
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,051
Let 'er rip.

8
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:11,529
Keep moving your hands
until you feel something.

9
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,169
She's a wise old woman.

10
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:22,180
Look into the ice.

11
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,474
I'm looking.

12
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,714
Closer.

13
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:33,356
Look into your soul, Mr. Kent.

14
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,724
As your wise old fingers
will tell you,

15
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:46,856
I didn't cry at my mother's funeral,
and I don't cry now.

16
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,401
Look to your own miseries,
Mr. Kent.

17
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:52,199
Otherwise, you are a dead man.

18
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,333
Narcissa, do you have another nickel?

19
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:56,568
Give her a tip.

20
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,770
A dead man!

21
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:02,906
Dead!

22
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:07,644
See how much happiness
your money can buy.

23
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:03,364
Now, what possessed you
to take me there?

24
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:08,437
Well, when I first saw you,
my tapeworm said, "Fortune-teller,"

25
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:09,845
and that settled it.

26
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,907
I never go against my tapeworm.

27
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,215
I don't believe
in this tapeworm of yours.

28
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,687
Most tapeworms
are chewers, not talkers.

29
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,192
Oh, yes. He's got a very strong will.
He's irresistible.

30
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,254
I'm cold.

31
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,461
Let's take a streetcar.

32
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,359
We can't pay.

33
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,869
It's the 23.
We won't have to.

34
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,811
Are you an American?

35
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:45,081
I'm not an American.
I'm a nymphomaniac.

36
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,547
As long as you're not American,
you can be whatever you like.

37
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:51,713
Well, he's an American.

38
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,152
You're mistaken.

39
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:56,920
He may have
the stink of America on him,

40
00:04:56,996 --> 00:05:00,591
but I assure you
he's Canadian... 100%.

41
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,658
- You lied to me?
- No.

42
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:06,671
It's like I said.
I'm a producer from New York.

43
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,400
Just down on his luck.

44
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,602
A real-live, Yankee-Doodle boy.

45
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,475
Then you're no son of mine.

46
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:22,612
Muskeg beer hall.
End of the line!

47
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,892
Get up Get your boots on

48
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,225
Hurry up, hurry up

49
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,994
Time's a wastin'
if you're not tastin'

50
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,268
Lady Port-Huntley Beer

51
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,964
Can't wait to drink

52
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,029
One down, two down, three down, four

53
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:45,134
Along this town we want to be true

54
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,410
Lady Port-Huntley's beer

55
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:55,477
It's for me and for you

56
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:58,419
It's for me and for you

57
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:03,451
The Muskeg beer hour
is still gushing!

58
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,930
I'm Duncan Ellsworth,
your classical music host,

59
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:11,402
and I've got
major key news for you...

60
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,735
a contest, ladies ard gentlemer.

61
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:16,468
The most exciting in our history.

62
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:21,704
Want to trade your sorrows in
for some spondoolicks?

63
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:24,944
Here to explain how
is Her Serenity herself,

64
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,951
Lady Port-Huntley.

65
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:29,748
Thank you, Duncan.

66
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,990
Listen to the sounds of Winnipeg.

67
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:40,862
The white breathing of a nocturnal city
in this sad, sad world.

68
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,198
We at Muskeg beer

69
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,932
are proud that Winnipeg
has been chosen

70
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,736
four years in a row
by the London Times

71
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:53,745
as the world capital of sorrow
in the great depression.

72
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,646
In recognition of this honor,

73
00:06:56,716 --> 00:07:00,049
we will be hosting
a world-wide contest

74
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:05,955
to determine which nation's music
truly deserves to be called

75
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:08,516
"the saddest in the world".

76
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,757
Aspirirg virtuosos of tearful melody

77
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:15,164
are welcomed to travel here
and lay claim

78
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:19,398
to the jewel-studded crown
of frozer tears...

79
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:26,139
and $25,000 in prize money.

80
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:33,212
That's right...
25.000 depression-era dollars.

81
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:36,744
I can already see
that return ticket to Manhattan.

82
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,656
Come on, let's drink fast.
I got business to attend to.

83
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:44,059
The Lady Port-Huntley's
Saddest Music In The World cortest.

84
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,823
And they're off!

85
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,474
What do we really get for our money?

86
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,181
Listen.

87
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:54,454
Within a few months,
Congress will end prohibition

88
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,860
and America will be
saying goodbye to bootleggers

89
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,160
and be running...
and I mean running...

90
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:02,200
back to the neighborhood's bar.

91
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,704
Imagine a hundred million drinkers

92
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,331
willing to pay top dollars
for legal booze,

93
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:11,570
even if they can't make the rent
or buy their children shoes.

94
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:16,372
We, Canada, that happy
suds buddy to the north,

95
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,849
open the flood gates
and makes a killing.

96
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:23,384
If you're sad and like beer...

97
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,988
I'm your lady.

98
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,593
Maybe you should make
yourself scarce for a while.

99
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:33,558
Wait. Don't disappear on me.

100
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,391
How long will you be?

101
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,430
If I'm not thrown out,
under half an hour.

102
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,902
I'll just curl up here
and take a nap.

103
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,864
We will be going for countries
with the highest rate of depression

104
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,990
'cause this is where
people drink the most.

105
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,362
Excuse me for interrupting,
but somebody calling himself

106
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,497
the "American Ambassador of Sadness"

107
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,562
says that you wish
to see him immediately.

108
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,108
He can take a seat in the
waiting room like everybody else.

109
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,007
He refuses to wait.

110
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,876
He said if I didn't announce him
instantly, you'd have me fired.

111
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:27,017
And what does this buffoon look like?

112
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,418
Well-tailored,
wears spats,

113
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,820
clean fingernails,
clean-shaven.

114
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,222
Spats?

115
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:36,955
Would you call his hair slippery?

116
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:44,034
Chester Kent.

117
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,900
Okay, everybody.
Fifteen minutes.

118
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,637
Teddy, stay here.

119
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,014
Lady P.

120
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,990
Had a few hours between trains,
thought I'd drop in.

121
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,961
For what purpose?

122
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,590
Well... to see
how you're getting on.

123
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:16,257
It's a bad time for me.

124
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,166
I'm devoured with guilt

125
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,570
about the obscene amount
of money I'm making

126
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,939
at a time where so many people
have nothing.

127
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,171
I'm sure you do what you can.

128
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:32,013
And I am heartsick
about poor Teddy over here.

129
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,848
With a wonderful wife
and two beautiful children,

130
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,581
and has to make me...

131
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,355
sing in a seesaw

132
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,189
whenever I ask him,
just to keep his job.

133
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,421
Don't be embarrassed, Teddy.

134
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,557
Idealism and business rarely mix.

135
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:49,490
May I?

136
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,929
But I console myself
with the thought, Chester,

137
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,668
that if I hadn't met you,

138
00:12:56,742 --> 00:13:00,269
I might never have done
anything to be ashamed of!

139
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,814
Why bother with shame at all,
is my philosophy.

140
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,851
Look at the pictures
on the wall! Look at them!

141
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,317
Tell me what you think!

142
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,121
You're everywhere.

143
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,680
I'd say you qualify
as the star of your own life.

144
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:21,060
When I had a life, that was true.

145
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,530
You got a new dolly.
It's nice.

146
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:32,001
Teddy, have you ever wondered
where my legs went?

147
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,238
He's been a dear.
He has never asked once.

148
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,144
Well, let's be fair, Helen.

149
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,308
You can only hang one
of those missing legs on me.

150
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,983
What is it that you
want from me today?

151
00:13:39,984 --> 00:13:41,581
I want a crack at that prize money.

152
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,753
And how do you intend to do that?

153
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,987
By serving up
the saddest number you ever heard.

154
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:51,757
I've got schmaltz routines
that could ring sobs from a moose.

155
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,062
Really? And you'll be
representing America, right?

156
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:59,298
Yeah. Tears, Helen, for all
those blubbers in the old melting pot.

157
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,164
I doubt there is anyone on Earth

158
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:07,008
who knows less about grief
than you do.

159
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,546
Nothing makes a dent.

160
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:12,345
Sadness is just happiness
turned on its ass. It's all showbiz.

161
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,909
You got an orchestra handy?
I'll prove it to you.

162
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,284
Actually, I do.

163
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,755
- Great. Haul 'em in here.
- Teddy, the orchestra.

164
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,918
They're very genteel.
They play blindfolded.

165
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:27,124
A novelty act, huh?
What's the kicker?

166
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:32,968
When Teddy and I
sing on the seesaw, they play.

167
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:35,430
That's a hard act to follow.

168
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:38,535
Your audition will be much simpler.

169
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:42,240
I want you to tell
about my "accident",

170
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,475
if you can still remember it.

171
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,620
No, Teddy, you've been spared today.

172
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,430
Go back.

173
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:00,988
Start the music.

174
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,601
Play not too fast, and with feeling.

175
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,970
So, where do I start?

176
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,101
Why don't you start with your father?

177
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:15,340
And end with him...
full circle.

178
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:29,092
Well, he was in love with you,
but there was a problem...

179
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,492
you loved me.

180
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,829
Yes...

181
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:34,627
and you never loved me.

182
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,733
Yes, I see it.

183
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:39,635
- So long ago.
- It feels like yesterday.

184
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:40,967
I was flattered.

185
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,973
A beautiful woman...
paying attention to me.

186
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,406
He suspected me.

187
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,146
He had good reason to. Right under
his nose, every chance we got.

188
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,581
- We drove him to drink.
- He wanted to marry you.

189
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,187
He thought himself...
a cuckold by you.

190
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:10,601
- Oh, yes, I see it.
- So long ago.

191
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,502
It feels like yesterday.

192
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,874
He started wearing his old uniform.

193
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:21,709
Canadian lieutenant.
The great war.

194
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,375
Marching up and down the stairs
late into the night with his rifle.

195
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:26,543
Drunk.

196
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:30,884
Your brother Roderick
trying to heal him with music.

197
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:33,147
The day of the car trip.

198
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:37,589
The ice storm.
The empty road.

199
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,029
Except for him
trying to stop the car.

200
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:43,467
- His hand was out.
- And there was your head lifting up.

201
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:45,531
Blocking my view.

202
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,969
- Oh, yes. I see it.
- I see it.

203
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:54,444
So long ago.
It feels like yesterday.

204
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:03,415
- Jesus, dad! What do we do?
- Get my bag.

205
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:05,789
Her leg's stuck!
We gotta get her loose!

206
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:08,490
You'll tear it off completely,
you idiot. Do as I say.

207
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,790
I'm the doctor here.

208
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,694
- You're drunk.
- My bag!

209
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,991
I'm going to save the woman I love.

210
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,969
Do you hear me?
The woman I love!

211
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,370
We're going to get married.

212
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:27,301
Please!
Please do something!

213
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,074
Help me!

214
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:35,648
We've got to occupate...
and amputate.

215
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,279
Dad, you better let me help.

216
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,324
Out of my way.
You make me sick.

217
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,684
There, love.

218
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,755
Now there's a puzzle.

219
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:51,200
Steady.
Steady, steady, steady.

220
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,504
You're cutting the wrong leg!

221
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,641
Dad, you're through the bone already!

222
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,479
- That's her good leg!
- Now look what you made me do!

223
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,611
Stop!

224
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,996
Oh, my...

225
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,003
Hello, Helen.

226
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,831
I'm here to represent Canada.

227
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,672
If you'll let me.

228
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,812
Take your blindfolds off, gentlemen.

229
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:42,481
Pay attention.
This is Canada speaking.

230
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:46,513
Play "Red Maple Leaves".
On the double!

231
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,660
Don't tell me you live here
and you don't know it!

232
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:58,632
- Just the red maple leaf...
- What do you say?

233
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,200
- About your legs?
- ..and when they come again...

234
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:05,107
- That's a pretty tough break.
- ..you'll find me.

235
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:07,441
But doesn't it make you sad?

236
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:11,506
- ...where I left my heart...
- Well, life's full of surprises, Helen.

237
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,882
Take away those surprises,
and life's a pretty dull proposition.

238
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:17,945
- ...maple leaves.
- Isn't that right, pop?

239
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:19,388
Why are you here?

240
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,655
Same as you.
One last crack at the jackpot.

241
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:25,253
I will love this woman
until my dying day.

242
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,355
Let me shout it through the rooftops.

243
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:29,332
I even brought her something.

244
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,062
Stop it!
No bribes.

245
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:35,606
All right. Here's an angle
for you, Helen.

246
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,006
America vs. Canada.

247
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:41,876
A brash son comes home to duke it out
musically with his war-vet pop.

248
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:45,280
The old man's drowning in his sorrows,
the son wants no part of this.

249
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,942
But in order to win the dough,

250
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,045
that Yank's gotta find
his tear ducts in a hurry.

251
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,447
You got something there.

252
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,922
Okay, America, you're on.

253
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:18,546
And now we see Gavrillo the Great,
one of the greatest cellists in Europe.

254
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,950
No one has ever
seen his face uncovered,

255
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:26,354
for he wears upon it at all times,
even during public performances,

256
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,256
a veil as black as night.

257
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:29,624
That's right, Mary.

258
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:33,290
They say he wears it to express
the national sadness of Serbia,

259
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:36,027
whose famed assassin Gavrilo Princip

260
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:39,229
fired the first fatal shot
of the great war...

261
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:41,431
the war to end all wars.

262
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:43,667
Nine million killed, Duncan.

263
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,677
That should make a man
very sad, indeed.

264
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,769
Roderick?

265
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,583
- Roderick.
- Father.

266
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,289
Come here!
Give your father a hug!

267
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,007
I'm sorry. It's just my own skin
is very sensitive.

268
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,476
You look well, Father.

269
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:20,504
My health is gone.

270
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:24,515
But I'm sober and I pay my bills
and I keep my pants pressed.

271
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:26,709
Where's Chester?

272
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:28,984
He's supposed to be here.

273
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,049
I couldn't stand one more second
with him ten years ago.

274
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,616
Why would he stomach me now?

275
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,019
I'd forgotten how bright
the light is here.

276
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,052
Don't mind these glasses.

277
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,831
How can you see through those?

278
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:46,735
It's like I'm painting things
just by looking at them.

279
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,467
- But where's Chester?
- He must be at the music hall.

280
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:53,076
The opening pageant
is set for tonight.

281
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,703
Let's march, my boy!

282
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:59,774
Father... did Chester ever admit
to stealing my music box?

283
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,046
That was ten years ago, son.

284
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,616
Can't you ever forget anything?

285
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:45,561
There we go.

286
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:47,830
Here we are.

287
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:54,598
There.

288
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,535
Home.

289
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:02,244
Good Lord. What's that?

290
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,450
Close your ears.
Excuse me.

291
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:15,085
Your brother's here!

292
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,358
Could you say goodbye to your...
guest and come down? Quickly?

293
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,762
Have her go out by the back way.

294
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:24,864
Can't have strangers at a homecoming.

295
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,665
You don't play anymore.

296
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,572
Oh, yes. But on my knees.

297
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,166
No more dignity.

298
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:36,910
No more dignity, huh?

299
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,313
Family motto.

300
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:47,586
How are you, Roderick?

301
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:50,285
Just the way I always picture you.

302
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,626
Thundering down the stairs,
bursting into a room.

303
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,691
Even in bare feet you thunder.

304
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,462
You still sound
like your mewling cello.

305
00:23:57,536 --> 00:24:00,801
In a noisy house,
someone must be soft.

306
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,370
This one plays the grace notes.

307
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,076
Which reminds me.

308
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:10,080
All of these years,
I have a present for you.

309
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,251
I was waiting for this day.

310
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,117
There's no need for you
to do this, Father.

311
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:22,557
I remember taking it out nights
when the rats were scurrying.

312
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:25,693
Carrying it over to the window,

313
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:29,757
and calling your name through it...
to bring you home.

314
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:45,941
What else have you got
squirreled away for him?

315
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,316
I knitted you a sweater.

316
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:52,515
Actually, I made three.

317
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:54,349
One for ea...

318
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,222
You, and one for your wife and...

319
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,323
one for your son.

320
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:04,163
My skin is far too excitable
for wool, I fear.

321
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,734
Would you mind terribly
if we turn that light off?

322
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:08,300
You're still a hypochondriac.

323
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,524
Take that up with my
physician Dr. Loords...

324
00:25:11,525 --> 00:25:12,939
the best doctor in Germany!

325
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,741
His opinion, for what it's worth,
is that I'm lucky to be alive.

326
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:17,543
Have you heard nothing
from your wife?

327
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:20,608
Not a sign, not a word,
not a sausage.

328
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,585
She just disappeared
when your son died?

329
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:26,383
It was gradual.

330
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:32,492
A ship going down...
with all her lights and barely a sound.

331
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:36,631
She forgot about loving me.

332
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:40,565
She even forgot about our son.

333
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,630
What's that hissing?
Can somebody turn that off?

334
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,800
I think I hear
a faucet running upstairs.

335
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:49,145
- Is your friend still here?
- She went out the back.

336
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,205
Well, someone's left the faucet on.

337
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,274
No more debate!
Just deal with it!

338
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,184
All right, I'll deal with it.

339
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:00,655
Don't hurt Roderick!

340
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:21,639
Lady Port-Huntley's

341
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:26,241
Saddest Music in The World
opening pageant has begun,

342
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,980
led by the Zanis of Africa.

343
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:30,988
Resplendent!

344
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:34,116
If I can focus my opera glasses
for a moment here...

345
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:35,682
yes!

346
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,992
Resplendent in their
delightful paints and scars.

347
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:42,659
Absolutely beautiful.

348
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:47,694
This pageant of sad nations brought
to us by Lady Port-Huntley Beer

349
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:51,606
is shaping up to be a frightening
contest of human despair...

350
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:54,008
a cavalcade of misery.

351
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:57,981
There's Poland, China, Albania!

352
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,384
That was good fun, Narcissa.

353
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,255
I must tell you my dream.

354
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:09,725
Yeah? Well, hurry.

355
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,659
The competition's about to start.

356
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,460
A man was showing me
how to take the guts out of the goose.

357
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:19,128
He stood on the wings
and pulled the bird's legs hard.

358
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:20,501
That's how you do it.

359
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:24,073
Everything came loose
in a white heap...

360
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,133
except for the breast and the heart.

361
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,509
He put the heart in my hands.

362
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:31,807
It was still beating very faintly.

363
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:34,977
Maybe you can sing about that.
Make us some prize money.

364
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:37,078
At the very last moment of the dream,

365
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:40,090
it didn't seem to be
the bird's heart I was holding.

366
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:44,387
It was so small.
I don't know whose it was.

367
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,658
Then I woke up.

368
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:49,894
Well, if it was tiny
and covered with slime,

369
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,128
it was probably mine.

370
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,961
You really don't
understand me at all.

371
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,507
Understand this...

372
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:59,065
if I don't get some backing fast
for a production number...

373
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,942
one with plenty
of saltwater dressing...

374
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,779
one of those foreign onion-peelers down
there is gonna snatch my prize money.

375
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,510
Come on.

376
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:12,449
Let's get crackin'.

377
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:40,148
No ore car beat the Siamese

378
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:43,551
when it comes to dignity,
cats, or twins.

379
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,223
But I'm embarrassed to say

380
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:51,058
that. Before now. I've never taken
Siamese sadness all that seriously.

381
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:54,724
You can almost hear the typhoon

382
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,064
bearing down
on a defenseless seaside village

383
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,696
through this tortured flute solo.

384
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:06,201
The fatal deluge
is announced by birds.

385
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:09,610
The performer has taken
the trouble to put out their eyes

386
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:13,583
so they'll have a bit more soul
to their warning chirps.

387
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:16,711
It's all in the details, Mary.

388
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:36,907
And now the Mexicans
take their first turn.

389
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,915
The singers are giving us a sad peak

390
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:58,513
into child-burial customs
down Mexico way.

391
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:02,856
The Mexican mama is beirg
very firm with her dead inf art.

392
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,623
"Now. Go away." she wails.

393
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,029
You are dead.

394
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:12,166
Don't sneak in at night
to nurse from my breast.

395
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:14,831
That milk is only for the living.

396
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:18,235
To Canadiar ears.
That may sound harsh.

397
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:21,642
Well, I guess dead children,
like any other kind,

398
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,180
have got to learn.

399
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:58,445
The Mexicans now take
their victory bath

400
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,677
in the Port-Huntley Pond.

401
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:02,853
For the Mexicans.

402
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:06,516
This is a first-time
full immersion in beer.

403
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,525
They don't seem very excited.

404
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,426
So far. Nobody's drinking.

405
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:13,555
God!

406
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,263
We still got prohibition,

407
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:20,270
and they got swimming pools
full of beer up there in Canada.

408
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,272
Why ain't they drinkin', Ed?

409
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,741
Mexicans ain't used to winnin'...
not since the Alamo.

410
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,243
They smell a rat.

411
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:32,408
If I got that lucky,
I'd drink till I drowned.

412
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:38,386
Now, that's sad.

413
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:46,986
Look at this street.

414
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:50,566
Where am I gonna find
a patron of the arts in Winnipeg...

415
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,899
in the dead of winter,
in this depression?

416
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,302
How much do you need?

417
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,033
I just rented a warehouse.

418
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,507
I got people lined up
to build sets, make costumes.

419
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:00,567
I got musicians, arrangers.

420
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,736
But I gotta put out first,
or they'll shut me down.

421
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,545
Maybe you should keep it simple.

422
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:07,809
America goes simple?
That's a hot one.

423
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:11,480
No, it's gotta be vulgar
and obvious... full of gimmicks.

424
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:14,389
You know, sadness,
but with sass and pizzazz.

425
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:17,451
They'll eat it up, but we gotta
hit them lots of different ways,

426
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:19,894
'cause if the judge sees
the same thing more than once,

427
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:21,431
she'll hold back those sniffles.

428
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:25,200
Please, sir, we're hungry. Do you
have any food you can give us?

429
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:26,327
No, I don't.

430
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:39,048
If you agree to drop out of this
competition and join my American team,

431
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,709
I'll pay your way
back home when I win.

432
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:43,117
- Really?
- Get to the brewery. Wait for me.

433
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:49,918
Damn sleepwalker.

434
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:00,302
Good night, Mother.

435
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:11,440
So, you...

436
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:14,610
manage to keep yourself
sad at all times, do you?

437
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,751
In my pocket is a jar.

438
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:21,989
In the jar,
preserved in my own tears,

439
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,652
is my son's heart.

440
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:33,061
This is the piece
that would win the contest.

441
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:34,661
"The Song is You".

442
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:37,597
We played it for Mother.

443
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:41,203
I played it for my son
at his funeral.

444
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:44,604
That's my sadness.

445
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,610
One death.

446
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:49,110
Or two.

447
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:51,587
I play it every day.

448
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:54,318
First on the cylinder,
then on my cello.

449
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,087
There is nothing sadder.

450
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,061
I need this song.

451
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,991
But I will never play it for money.

452
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:07,794
In fact, I want no one else
ever to hear it

453
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:10,932
until I play it again for my wife
whenever I find her.

454
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:13,670
Let's not dwell on the past so.

455
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:18,406
As for me, I will draw
on the sadness of Serbia.

456
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:21,916
The little country
that started the great war.

457
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,516
Gavrillo the Great will atone
for those nine million dead

458
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:30,390
by shoving them
down Chester's throat!

459
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:34,924
I'm pulling out $25,000...

460
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,001
then perhaps I can afford
to look properly for my wife.

461
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:44,498
You're Canadian, born and raised.

462
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:49,307
Until I walked down the streets
of Belgrade for the first time,

463
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,543
I never felt at home...
anywhere.

464
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:54,585
I finally knew who I was.

465
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,351
And where my heart dwelt.

466
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:58,854
Come.

467
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:01,517
Let me show you
where I hide my heart.

468
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,998
How does your tapeworm
feel about burials?

469
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:19,269
Like a bride at her wedding.

470
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,833
A festival of worms.

471
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:24,939
A grand old Winnipeg banker
is being planted today,

472
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,007
and I've got a hunch
his widow just might go

473
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:30,520
for a sad song tribute
to his financial prowess.

474
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:35,048
Let's go. We need a good spot
next to the family.

475
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,561
I'll let you in on a little secret.

476
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:48,401
I don't believe
that all this sadness really exists.

477
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:50,406
What a delightful notion.

478
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:53,807
Well, bad things happen.
I'm not denying that. Plenty of them.

479
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,278
But somehow, when people
start trying to show

480
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:58,645
how they've been affected
by these bad things,

481
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,343
they start faking it.

482
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,487
They know that, deep down,
no one really cares.

483
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:07,251
But they want people to know
they're suffering, dammit.

484
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,282
And others will go along with them,

485
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,022
making faces,
hoping someone will notice,

486
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:14,929
so that when something awful
happens to them,

487
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:17,524
they can get some
of this fake pity for themselves.

488
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:22,736
And now Michael's daughter Agnes
will quickly sing his favorite song.

489
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:26,705
Skip, skip, skip to my loo

490
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:30,604
Skip to my loo, my darling

491
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,333
Don't fall on me!

492
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,803
No. Mrs. Burnjones,
I'm Chester Kent,

493
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:57,841
a producer of
musical spectaculars in New York.

494
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:01,639
I was very moved
by your daughter's performance...

495
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:02,872
we all were.

496
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,881
It struck me that more people

497
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,940
should have the chance to hear her...

498
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:09,816
and the other sad music
that soothed your husband.

499
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:13,482
If we could mount
a musical tribute to him

500
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:15,548
on international radio,

501
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,288
people would be reminded
of what he meant to them,

502
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:19,954
and listeners who didn't know

503
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:23,990
about this wonderful banker's
life and great spirit...

504
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:26,229
Is that for the radio contest?

505
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:27,828
No!

506
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,505
Wait a minute!

507
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:33,071
Maybe we could tie it in with that!

508
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,736
There's such
a great audience, you see.

509
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:38,145
Well, if I let my daughter sing
for you, she won't come cheap,

510
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:40,683
and you'll have to pay in advance.

511
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:47,022
Well, I'd be willing to go
as high as $1.75.

512
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:49,491
She's worth more than that!

513
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:00,628
Look, nobody knows I'm broke.

514
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:03,299
Give a poor musician
just a whiff of American dough,

515
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,569
and he'll bend right over
for Uncle Sam.

516
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:09,239
Care to dance?

517
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:16,719
Poor Yiddish.
No country of your own, huh?

518
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:19,255
Come on over.
Put a little spritz in America.

519
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:35,195
Till your eyes get used to it.
We'll keep the light soft.

520
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:39,767
Legs.

521
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:44,740
How pliable and delicate
and sturdy they are.

522
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,645
What dangerous moods.

523
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,753
What subtle shifts in expression.

524
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:55,257
There's the leg that teases...

525
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,958
and the leg that feels guilty.

526
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:03,163
The leg that blushes
and wants to apologize.

527
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:07,262
The leg that stammers out its love...

528
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,806
and the leg that repudiates it.

529
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:13,741
Since the accident,

530
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:15,642
when I gave up my doctor's license,

531
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,647
not a day has passed
without my thinking

532
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:20,206
how I would make things
better for Helen.

533
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:23,048
You do evidently love her.

534
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,678
How could you think otherwise?

535
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:28,189
She must have artificial legs by now.

536
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,317
But she doesn't.

537
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:31,122
Wood and leather
don't agree with her.

538
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:34,323
They give her purple rashes
and big, unsightly welts.

539
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:36,889
None of the ordinary
prosthetic materials will do.

540
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:40,234
Then, sitting among
all the bottles that I'd emptied,

541
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:41,794
it finally came to me.

542
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,598
Glass.

543
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:45,935
Glass?

544
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,671
Yes, it's the perfect solution.

545
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:49,406
Helen loves glass.

546
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,040
She surrounds herself with it.

547
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:56,915
Her house is filled
with glass ornaments.

548
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:58,386
Creatures large and small.

549
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,787
She collects glass dolls...

550
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:02,724
hundreds of dolls
in a stained-glass room.

551
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:05,388
Waiting, like she is...

552
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,690
to walk.

553
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,160
Behold.

554
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:19,372
I've tried to give these to her.

555
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:21,743
I can never find the right moment.

556
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,143
My God.

557
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:26,206
And they were made
right here in Canada.

558
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:28,407
Now Lady Port-Huntley

559
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:32,320
can stand up and dance
to the saddest music in the world.

560
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:35,358
I've even filled them
with Port-Huntley Muskeg beer.

561
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:37,919
Why do you frown?

562
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:43,360
- I was thinking about my wife.
- Happier thoughts. Please.

563
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:49,097
I have a photograph of her...
leaping across a gutter.

564
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:53,774
Her legs suspended in midair.

565
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:59,643
I'm afraid these won't permit that,
but they can stretch out a fair way.

566
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:01,048
Could I see the picture?

567
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:09,482
No! It's...

568
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:18,434
She's not at all as I pictured her.

569
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:25,699
Excuse me, I've been admiring
your ear for the past five minutes.

570
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:27,767
I find it utterly beautiful.

571
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:30,780
It is perfectly shaped...
this one, the left one.

572
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:34,547
I wonder... I wonder if I
could whisper something into it.

573
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:36,449
Just a little story you might like.

574
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,489
Would you mind?
I won't come too close.

575
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,956
I'm deaf in that ear.

576
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:45,495
But I can hear just fine
in the other one.

577
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,730
No. This is the one I want.

578
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,463
You can still feel my breath.
Imagine what I'm telling you.

579
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:04,336
So, why'd you send for me?

580
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:07,009
Suppose I decided to back you.

581
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,912
Well, that would be very sporting.

582
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:13,617
I have to warn you... there'll be
many, many bills to pay.

583
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:17,127
- We can both pay our bills.
- You want me to win, I suppose.

584
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:21,222
Undo me.

585
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:23,993
Beg your pardon?

586
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:26,730
You have to start paying
your first bill right now.

587
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:31,368
I dislike beer.

588
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:35,845
For my jubilee, I requested
champagne and milk.

589
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,846
That's a pretty small tub.

590
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:40,440
- There'll be room enough.
- Suppose I refuse?

591
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:42,884
You're wasting your time.

592
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:45,678
Do I get instructions?

593
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:51,690
It's very simple. You undress me,
you bathe me, you put me to bed.

594
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:53,354
I like to be asked, not told.

595
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,421
- Who cares what you like?
- You do!

596
00:43:56,567 --> 00:44:01,061
All this bully-boy stuff.
Just say you want me.

597
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,800
It's easy to want you, Helen.
You're still beautiful.

598
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:05,034
Just say it.

599
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:08,806
And then let's go somewhere
where we can get serious.

600
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:10,244
Just undress me.

601
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:14,442
No sale.

602
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,484
One of you boys
take off your blindfold

603
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:19,749
and fish her out when she's done.

604
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:31,659
Well, that's the last of my pride.

605
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:33,327
Does your offer still stand?

606
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:41,939
A little bit of backbone...
is sexy in a man.

607
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:46,138
Be undressed
by the time I count to five.

608
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:47,910
One...

609
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:50,078
Two...

610
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:51,985
Three...

611
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:53,182
Four...

612
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:05,593
Representing Canada
is our first performer this evening.

613
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:07,159
Fyodor Kent.

614
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:12,538
He is wearing what appears to be
his own uniform from the great war.

615
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:16,409
And he stands or the stage
with an upturned piano...

616
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,811
his touching tribute

617
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:21,442
to the Canadians who fell
on the European battlefields.

618
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:26,846
Canadian troops site at Vimy,

619
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:31,327
the bird notes of reveille at dawn.

620
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:34,423
Let us follow the leaves of red...

621
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:39,696
as they swirl across the fields
of France and the raging ocean.

622
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,737
Come home, my boys.

623
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,239
Come home.

624
00:45:54,218 --> 00:46:00,248
Just the red maple leaves

625
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:02,519
And when they come again

626
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,494
You'll find me

627
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:10,625
Where I left my heart behind me

628
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:16,662
'Neath the red maple leaves

629
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,469
Maple leaves

630
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:29,176
Now the Zari performers from
the Cameroons are showing us

631
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:32,689
how villagers there
conduct a proper pygmy funeral.

632
00:46:32,756 --> 00:46:35,589
From these
wildly beaten jungle skins,

633
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:39,959
we are hearing
the true songs of bereavement

634
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,627
while friends and family
of the deceased

635
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:46,498
punish themselves with sharp stones.

636
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:50,506
Opering wounds
across kneecap and forehead.

637
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:54,237
Wounds that weeps tears of blood.

638
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:29,409
We gathered leaves to brush them

639
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:33,074
Which lovers sometimes do

640
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:36,210
You're gone, but I caress them

641
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:40,950
They're all I have of you

642
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:43,717
All I have of you

643
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:47,622
All I have of you

644
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:50,824
All I have of you

645
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:54,164
All I have of you

646
00:47:55,105 --> 00:47:56,766
All I have of you

647
00:47:58,175 --> 00:47:59,665
All I have of you

648
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:03,979
All I have

649
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,241
Of you

650
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,275
All I have of you

651
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:12,383
All I have

652
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,289
This has beer
a real eye-opener

653
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:24,834
for the traditionally reserved
Caradian audience

654
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,301
gathered here this evenirg.

655
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:31,205
The crowd is or its feet.
Swept up in the Zari frenzy.

656
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:47,948
The Africans have eliminated
Canada in their first challenge.

657
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:52,225
The beer bath makes it official.

658
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:55,464
Fyodor Kent must realize

659
00:48:55,532 --> 00:48:57,193
that in a world competition,

660
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,667
ordinary tears
aren't going to be enough.

661
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:04,833
Yes, Mary. A great disappointment
for Canada and Fyodor Kent.

662
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:08,776
The Zaris really seem
to be enjoyirg their victory.

663
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:11,814
Now they're whippirg
the head or the brew

664
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:14,476
into a happy
Port-Huntley mountain.

665
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:20,414
Great work, dad.
You've never sung it better.

666
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:23,482
'Course, those tribesmen put on
quite a show, don't they?

667
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,050
We could learn something from them.

668
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,790
You haven't brought
your kept woman with you, I hope.

669
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:30,196
- Which one do you mean?
- The girl on my streetcar.

670
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:31,427
The same one, I suppose,

671
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:34,299
who was making like a hurricane
upstairs when your brother came home.

672
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,629
Narcissa? She's here, all right.

673
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:39,164
She'd better be. My whole number
depends on... why? What's wrong?

674
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:41,574
Where does she come from?
What do you know about her?

675
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:43,974
I met her at the fairground.

676
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:46,675
She says she's from Serbia.
She makes stuff up, though.

677
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,684
Has she mentioned Roderick?

678
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:50,242
No, she's never met him.

679
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,220
Cancel your number.
Get her out of here.

680
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:54,917
Whether I'm right or wrong,
it's not worth the risk.

681
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:58,359
Where I come from, Pop,
winning is worth every risk.

682
00:49:58,428 --> 00:50:00,555
You'll kill me, Judas,
and your brother, too.

683
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:02,063
She's Roderick's wife.

684
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:06,492
That's a great yarn!

685
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:08,504
I'm not buying it, though.

686
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:12,265
And even if it was true,
that's showbiz.

687
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,871
I can't believe you're my son.

688
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:17,140
Hey, I didn't see you
canceling your number.

689
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:25,754
In the next round,
we have American sadness

690
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:28,416
squaring off against that of Spain.

691
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:30,483
Broadway producer Chester Kent

692
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:34,496
has selected just the right vintage
of American sadness

693
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:37,158
from the cotton fields
of the deep south.

694
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:39,726
Let's...

695
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:47,833
Let's get away from all this hullabaloo.
You need your quiet.

696
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:54,043
Oh, no. I wanna see what
this Broadway jackanapes knows...

697
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:56,785
about sadness.

698
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:04,186
Spain, right?

699
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:09,326
Tell you what... if you wanna drop out
of this competition and join America,

700
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,390
I'll pay your way
back home when I win.

701
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:16,966
Think about it.

702
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,511
The always impetuous Spanish

703
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:32,783
offer us a jail-side view
of the wages of sir.

704
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:35,791
Esmeralda awaits execution.

705
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:38,851
Her prison cell echoes
with her savage lament.

706
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:06,178
Swing low

707
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:10,549
Sweet chariot

708
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:16,616
Coming forth to carry me home

709
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:20,595
Swing low

710
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:25,260
Sweet chariot

711
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:31,934
Coming forth to carry me home

712
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:50,586
My eyes.

713
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:53,288
Close your eyes, boy.

714
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:54,887
No, no.
Close your eyes!

715
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:57,697
Take a few deep breaths.

716
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:04,030
Too many tea cakes for dinner.

717
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:07,133
My ears!
She's got her teeth in them!

718
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:12,705
Coming forth to carry me home

719
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:15,649
The raindrops burn me!
Do you hear their hiss?

720
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:17,448
Let's leave.

721
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:22,949
Coming forth to carry me home

722
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:25,688
Can't you smell that?
It's roses.

723
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:27,955
My nostrils are choking.

724
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:31,990
Too many thorns.
I bleed!

725
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:36,263
She won't stay down!

726
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,104
Narcissa!

727
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:40,642
Sweet chariot

728
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:45,204
Coming forth to carry me home

729
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,613
I'm going mad.

730
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:51,780
Forth to carry me home

731
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:14,937
America just swallowed up
Spain in that match.

732
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:17,343
The local crowd
is clearly carried away

733
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:20,577
by both the performer
and the pyrotechnics.

734
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:24,416
As far as they're corcerned.
Sadness isn't hurt one bit

735
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:28,651
by a little
razzle-dazzle showmanship.

736
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:12,398
Who goes there?

737
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:15,836
Gavrillo the Great.
I'm here to play for the funeral.

738
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:17,338
You may enter.

739
00:56:21,578 --> 00:56:22,977
Who goes there?

740
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:28,047
Roderick Cuckoch, son of Fyodor.

741
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,481
I'm looking for my instrument.

742
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:32,783
Go on in.

743
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,391
Why are you so late?

744
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:44,626
I came as quick as I could.

745
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:46,760
I got through all the doors.

746
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:49,100
But you weren't supposed
to come through any of them.

747
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:50,935
You told them
what they wanted to know.

748
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:55,374
Now he's dead, and I have
to close all the doors between us

749
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:56,935
and lock them with this key.

750
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:00,312
Our son is dead?

751
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:04,146
The doors were for him, not for you.

752
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:07,984
You took them all away from him,
and so he died.

753
00:57:08,057 --> 00:57:10,150
Please don't leave me here.

754
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:12,626
Who will play at the funeral?

755
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:14,390
You can play from in here.

756
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:18,032
But not too soft, or he won't hear.

757
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:22,998
Serbia. Paging Serbia.

758
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:24,437
Please report immediately.

759
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:25,565
Son?

760
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:28,204
I beg you not to go out.

761
00:57:30,413 --> 00:57:31,573
I must play.

762
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:35,675
Please.

763
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:37,946
Please don't!

764
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:40,317
They'll be listening.

765
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:09,379
A tardy Gavrillo the Great
finally appears on the stage

766
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:12,387
to face ar impatient crowd.

767
00:58:12,455 --> 00:58:15,982
We've heard much talk
about his plaintive cello ore.

768
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:20,120
Which has drawn enough moisture
from hardened old-world eyes

769
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:21,993
to fill the English Channel.

770
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:25,998
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

771
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:38,003
I'm sorry,
but my ears are quite sensitive.

772
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:42,548
Some of you in the first few rows
are swallowing too loudly.

773
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:45,284
And you, sir,
could you please refrain

774
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,255
from breathing
through your nose like that?

775
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:49,951
And there's a woman in a straw hat
whose stomach is growling.

776
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,687
Now, what is that stink?

777
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:54,093
Is this a hog barn or a concert hall?

778
01:00:57,253 --> 01:01:02,247
Still no word on the condition
of Gavrillo the Great.

779
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:08,264
We don't know if he's in a coma
or just very, very sad.

780
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:11,164
We'll try to find out
as soon as we can.

781
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:14,464
Now a word
from Port-Huntley beer.

782
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:22,703
Get up, get your boots on

783
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:23,871
Hurry up, hurry up

784
01:01:23,946 --> 01:01:26,779
Time's a wastin'
if you're not tastin'

785
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,311
Lady Port-Huntley beer

786
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:30,545
Can't wait to drink

787
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,679
One down, two down three down, more

788
01:01:32,755 --> 01:01:36,418
along this town we want to be true

789
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:42,062
Stay away from him.
Haven't you done enough?

790
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:44,827
Narcissa, have you
ever seen my brother before?

791
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:48,494
He looks vaguely familiar.

792
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,673
You haven't been married
to this gentleman, have you?

793
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:54,103
Or had a child with him?

794
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:56,111
That wouldn't have
slipped your mind, I trust.

795
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:59,012
I would hate to be
so careless with loved ones.

796
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:00,807
But...

797
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:04,215
He could be anyone.

798
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:09,651
Well, she's scatterbrained,
I'll admit, but she's not lying!

799
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:12,991
Did you see him while she was
on that swing? Look at him now!

800
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:17,731
- Maybe if I spoke to him.
- No, I want you both to leave.

801
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,291
If he wakes up and sees you,
he'll never play again.

802
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:24,597
You heard the man, Narcissa.

803
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:36,679
I know you're not the jealous type,
but my tapeworm says

804
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:39,244
I should spend at least
one night with your brother.

805
01:02:41,724 --> 01:02:46,787
I think the fact that he's my brother
might be a good reason not to.

806
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:50,398
- Well, it's not up to me.
- I'm asking you not to.

807
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:55,260
It's embarrassing...
but I'm asking you not to.

808
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:57,297
Don't worry.

809
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:08,840
What happened to me out there?

810
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:13,478
Your senses
didn't have time to cool down.

811
01:03:14,857 --> 01:03:17,417
There will be other chances.

812
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:23,256
I was hypnotized by that swing...
that girl... who was she?

813
01:03:24,567 --> 01:03:26,000
A North End stripper.

814
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:28,159
One of Chester's showgirls.

815
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:30,569
All that Broadway sis-boom-ba.

816
01:03:31,073 --> 01:03:33,405
Don't you think the music
should speak for itself?

817
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:38,004
I heard and saw Narcissa.
She sent shivers through me.

818
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:42,517
Next time, you must keep your head clear
of distractions before your perform.

819
01:03:44,086 --> 01:03:45,747
If I ever perform again.

820
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,086
The judge must be furious with me.

821
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:49,647
Don't fret, my son.

822
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:52,385
Tonight we'll make her so happy...

823
01:03:53,529 --> 01:03:56,020
she'll forgive everything
that's ever happened.

824
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:58,862
Shouldn't we wait for a luckier time?

825
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:09,302
Make sure you tell her
they're from me.

826
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:20,480
Teddy, let's not argue.

827
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:26,284
The "Treaty of Versailles" number...
it's a stink, isn't it?

828
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:31,795
I wouldn't let those Germans
clean my kitchen floor.

829
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:34,900
Excuse me, Lady Port-Huntley.

830
01:04:34,971 --> 01:04:37,201
May I speak
to you privately for a minute?

831
01:04:37,273 --> 01:04:38,763
The Great Gavrillo.

832
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:40,900
You want another shot
at the archduke?

833
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:43,236
Please.

834
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:47,576
I'm most humbled in your presence.
I'm here to arrange an introduction.

835
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:51,880
In case you haven't noticed,
I am judging a contest right now.

836
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:56,015
You must believe
this introduction will matter more.

837
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:57,582
Hey, no tricks.

838
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,321
You must win your money down there,

839
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:00,919
like everyone else, on the stage.

840
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:04,489
I am only here
as an ambassador of happiness.

841
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:07,825
You haven't had a moment's peace

842
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:10,395
since you and these friends
parted company.

843
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:15,167
You are as presumptuous
as you are rude. Just leave.

844
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:17,576
- If I am wrong, just say the word.
- You are wrong.

845
01:05:17,647 --> 01:05:18,909
If I am wrong...

846
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:23,480
together, we can throw
these friends from the balcony.

847
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:24,883
If you go with them.

848
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:33,894
Go lift a thumb.
Poland just beat Germany.

849
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:37,898
Let's see,
before we make the final toss.

850
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:39,127
A moment.

851
01:05:52,915 --> 01:05:54,348
From Father.

852
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:34,313
I hear music when I look at you

853
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:42,454
Of every dream I ever knew

854
01:06:42,965 --> 01:06:47,061
Down deep in my heart

855
01:06:47,636 --> 01:06:51,470
I hear it play

856
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:55,408
I feel it start

857
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:58,742
Then melt away

858
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:04,378
I hear music when I look at you

859
01:07:04,453 --> 01:07:09,481
A beautiful theme
of every dream I ever knew

860
01:07:09,558 --> 01:07:11,890
Down deep in my heart

861
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:14,225
I hear it say

862
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:19,859
Is this the day?

863
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:24,531
I alone have heard this lovely strain

864
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:29,144
I alone have heard this glad refrain

865
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:33,113
Must it be forever inside of me?

866
01:07:33,182 --> 01:07:35,548
Why can't I let it go?

867
01:07:35,618 --> 01:07:37,745
Why can't I let you know?

868
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:42,484
Why can't I let you know
the song my heart would sing?

869
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:46,927
A beautiful rhapsody
of love and youth and spring

870
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:49,624
The music is sweet

871
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:52,132
The words are true

872
01:07:52,201 --> 01:07:56,968
The song is you

873
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,667
I hear music when I look at you

874
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:03,269
A beautiful theme
of every dream I ever knew

875
01:08:03,345 --> 01:08:05,108
Down deep in my heart

876
01:08:05,181 --> 01:08:06,842
I hear it play

877
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,679
I feel it start

878
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:11,151
Then melt away

879
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:13,848
I hear music when I touch your hand

880
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:17,359
A beautiful melody
from some enchanted land

881
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:19,087
Down deep in my heart

882
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:20,856
I hear it say

883
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:25,026
Is this the day?

884
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:28,332
I alone have heard this lovely strain

885
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:32,099
I alone have heard this glad refrain

886
01:08:32,174 --> 01:08:35,041
Must it be forever inside of me?

887
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,544
Why can't I let it go?

888
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:38,307
Why can't I let you know?

889
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:41,816
Why can't I let you know
the song my heart would sing?

890
01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:45,547
That beautiful rhapsody
of love and youth and spring

891
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:47,384
The music is sweet

892
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:49,356
The words are true

893
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:53,293
The song is you

894
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:57,694
The song is you

895
01:08:57,867 --> 01:09:00,392
The song is you

896
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:13,071
If you like,
I could sing something else.

897
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:18,348
You have turned
our most private grief

898
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:19,887
into...

899
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:22,389
a kind of peep show,

900
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:25,859
with my brother the pimp
selling tickets!

901
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:29,064
Why not find yourself
a dance partner?

902
01:09:29,131 --> 01:09:31,998
There's nothing wrong with the tune,
longhair. It's catchy!

903
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:40,633
Die!

904
01:09:43,412 --> 01:09:45,141
Give me more of that fizz.

905
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:50,610
You've been away long enough.

906
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:15,166
Care to dance?

907
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:17,643
Well, look at you.

908
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:20,512
Cinderella in spades.

909
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:26,454
I am told I am unbreakable!

910
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:29,388
I just kicked a ball!

911
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:33,485
And right then I thought,
"Tonight, I'm gonna go to one!"

912
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:35,427
I'm gonna bring my orchestra.

913
01:10:35,497 --> 01:10:37,488
It's not gonna be a masked ball.

914
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:38,965
All blindfolds off!

915
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:40,490
Come!

916
01:11:07,529 --> 01:11:09,827
If you want me to be your wife,

917
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:11,525
I'm happy to say I'm your wife.

918
01:11:12,234 --> 01:11:13,724
If you want us to have a dead son,

919
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:15,702
I have no objection to having one.

920
01:11:16,472 --> 01:11:18,167
But, really, if he's dead...

921
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:20,708
I don't see what difference it makes.

922
01:11:42,531 --> 01:11:45,694
You know?
I hardly recognize you.

923
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:52,932
I feel all those lost, wonderful years
come running back to me.

924
01:11:53,008 --> 01:11:55,977
I know they're not, but...
this is how I feel.

925
01:11:56,045 --> 01:11:57,910
It's your happiness
I don't recognize.

926
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:00,744
Where's all that cruelty?
You had the market cornered.

927
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:02,948
Let's compare legs.

928
01:12:03,552 --> 01:12:04,541
Come on.

929
01:12:07,222 --> 01:12:09,053
Well, there's no contest.

930
01:12:09,124 --> 01:12:11,115
For one thing,
there's no beer in mine.

931
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,621
Look how they sparkle.

932
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:16,988
They feel so smooth.

933
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:18,693
I never have to shave.

934
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:20,498
Come. Touch them.

935
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:25,598
I swear I can feel your touch.

936
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:28,770
It makes me bubble.

937
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:35,449
Got any toenail polish?
I'll paint your toenails for you.

938
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:39,115
Hey, you devil.

939
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,383
Are you already counting
your prize money?

940
01:12:42,224 --> 01:12:43,384
Not so.

941
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:48,857
We might as well be strangers.

942
01:12:50,099 --> 01:12:54,468
Good Lord.
The years leave no trace.

943
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:55,867
There's not a mark on you.

944
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,401
And yet...
you must've been hurt more than I.

945
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:10,578
Wait!

946
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:12,483
Was that me?
Did I break?

947
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:14,181
No, no. Downstairs.

948
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:16,123
Some other glass lady.

949
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:18,182
Shoddy workmanship.

950
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,665
That was nice.
I hope I see you again.

951
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:31,463
Where are you going?

952
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:32,939
I've got to rehearse.

953
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:35,032
Good luck in the contest.

954
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:17,904
Am I going to be enough
for you for a while?

955
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:20,244
You're the only name
left on my dance card.

956
01:15:20,983 --> 01:15:23,247
How long before you
start laughing at me?

957
01:15:23,318 --> 01:15:25,149
I'm only gonna make you happy.

958
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:30,956
If you succeed, I am gonna
make you very, very rich.

959
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:37,863
I wish I could feel the cold
against my leg and my skirt.

960
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:44,836
Lok. No sag.
No varicose veins.

961
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:47,240
These are legs to die for, hon.

962
01:15:50,412 --> 01:15:54,746
Well, I thought... if the two of you
want something to laugh at,

963
01:15:54,816 --> 01:15:55,805
try me.

964
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:56,873
Father.

965
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:04,583
Sooner or later, Helen, I knew
you'd show up to pay your respects.

966
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:07,629
You have a long way to go
before I start saying thank you!

967
01:16:07,696 --> 01:16:10,324
Him... have you forgotten
he helped me saw!

968
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:13,197
I was there, remember?

969
01:16:14,603 --> 01:16:15,661
All right.

970
01:16:16,471 --> 01:16:18,996
All right, forgive me. Please.

971
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:24,073
Better quit, Pop.
You're just making it worse.

972
01:16:24,146 --> 01:16:26,514
Let's go. Let's go!
This is not a request! Let's go!

973
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:28,516
He's an abomination!

974
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:42,171
The family's finished
when we bury him.

975
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:44,678
I'd say it was over a long time ago.

976
01:19:44,746 --> 01:19:46,236
And what brings you here?

977
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:50,312
The last time we came...

978
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:53,345
Chester,
there was a blizzard, remember?

979
01:19:55,056 --> 01:19:58,219
What good is memory, Narcissa?
Why make yourself sad?

980
01:19:58,293 --> 01:19:59,453
I'm not.

981
01:20:00,095 --> 01:20:01,323
That was a happy day.

982
01:20:01,396 --> 01:20:03,887
I'll say. I made
a snow angel on top of you.

983
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:35,085
Roderick... thank you.

984
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:38,064
You just gave me
a great idea for a number.

985
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:20,162
And so it will be
America's Chester Kent

986
01:22:20,235 --> 01:22:22,965
against Serbia's Gavrillo the Great

987
01:22:23,038 --> 01:22:25,529
in tomorrow night's
Lady Port-Huntley's beer

988
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:28,599
Saddest Music in the World finale.

989
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:36,345
I'm getting cold.

990
01:22:36,851 --> 01:22:38,580
Since when do you get cold?

991
01:22:38,653 --> 01:22:41,144
I was hoping for one
of your special snow treats.

992
01:22:41,856 --> 01:22:44,347
Maybe we should just
concentrate on the singing.

993
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,620
As you wish.

994
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:50,192
Has your tapeworm decided
to give me the old heave-ho?

995
01:22:50,899 --> 01:22:52,423
I think he may be dead.

996
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:54,999
I'm sorry to hear that.

997
01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:56,662
We got along so well.

998
01:22:57,605 --> 01:23:00,438
Maybe he's just eating.
I feel kind of empty.

999
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:02,169
You and me both.

1000
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,676
I'm stuck for a final number.

1001
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:07,543
Isn't it all decided?

1002
01:23:07,615 --> 01:23:11,278
The judge seems to be singing the
"Star-Spangled Banner" in her sleep.

1003
01:23:11,886 --> 01:23:13,877
I want people to say I deserved it.

1004
01:23:13,955 --> 01:23:15,946
- Which people?
- My brother.

1005
01:23:16,758 --> 01:23:19,886
That fellow you went off with the
night I nearly died of a head injury.

1006
01:23:22,297 --> 01:23:23,457
I wanna crush him.

1007
01:23:25,233 --> 01:23:27,827
In the name of Serbia,
I kill you both.

1008
01:23:27,902 --> 01:23:29,733
Let the world war begin.

1009
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:33,807
How many bullets will it take?!

1010
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:36,708
Roderick! It's the third time
you've attacked me.

1011
01:23:36,778 --> 01:23:39,713
I don't care if you are crazy.
I've had enough.

1012
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:59,932
- Why won't you die?
- You didn't have a gun.

1013
01:24:00,802 --> 01:24:02,861
Gavrilo the Great
wouldn't have missed.

1014
01:24:03,505 --> 01:24:07,703
Two shots, and Sarajevo
and the whole world goes to war.

1015
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:12,238
Nine million dead, Narcissa.

1016
01:24:12,313 --> 01:24:13,871
And... and...

1017
01:24:13,948 --> 01:24:16,007
you won't even remember one?

1018
01:24:19,154 --> 01:24:20,644
Let me out, please.

1019
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:41,572
It was fun while it lasted.

1020
01:24:43,912 --> 01:24:45,743
Look for me in the winner's circle.

1021
01:24:49,017 --> 01:24:50,348
Long way home to India, huh?

1022
01:24:50,418 --> 01:24:52,418
How would you girls like
to earn some quick bucks

1023
01:24:52,487 --> 01:24:55,413
just by playing Eskimos
for ten minutes, okay?

1024
01:24:55,490 --> 01:25:00,018
According to my spies, you have
not stopped seeing Narcissa

1025
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:02,757
until last night when
she wandered off into the Tundra.

1026
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:06,494
When I told you it was over,
I thought it was. Truly.

1027
01:25:07,435 --> 01:25:09,027
Turns out it was almost over.

1028
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:11,538
Quite a piece of work, Chester Kent.

1029
01:25:11,606 --> 01:25:14,006
Yeah, I know. I thought that's
what you liked about me.

1030
01:25:14,075 --> 01:25:16,839
You might be too big
a piece of work, even for me.

1031
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:19,303
You're saying you're through with me?

1032
01:25:19,881 --> 01:25:21,712
I wish I was saying that.

1033
01:25:23,218 --> 01:25:27,018
I'm saying...
that you're hanging by a thread.

1034
01:25:27,088 --> 01:25:28,180
Yeah.

1035
01:25:28,256 --> 01:25:30,816
Maybe when you see
this number tonight,

1036
01:25:30,892 --> 01:25:32,826
that thread will turn into a rope.

1037
01:25:33,661 --> 01:25:34,923
Look, Helen.

1038
01:25:34,996 --> 01:25:37,829
I swear I'm gonna climb back
over into your good graces.

1039
01:25:40,168 --> 01:25:41,795
Check the back of my leg.

1040
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:43,497
Tell me there is not a crack.

1041
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:53,211
I don't see anything.

1042
01:25:55,550 --> 01:26:00,214
America's Chester Kent
has conquered the air and the earth.

1043
01:26:00,288 --> 01:26:02,620
Now. Poised to vanquish water.

1044
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:09,118
He immortalizes the long-forgotten
Alaskan kayak tragedy of 1898.

1045
01:26:10,765 --> 01:26:15,225
And approachirg the stage area
is the maestro of melancholy...

1046
01:26:17,038 --> 01:26:21,202
the Serbian ne plus ultra
of the cello horn.

1047
01:26:21,276 --> 01:26:23,870
Gavrillo the Great!

1048
01:28:23,031 --> 01:28:25,625
Isn't it rather odd
that Lady Port-Huntley

1049
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:29,192
is actually in one of these numbers
when she's also the judge?

1050
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:33,070
Well, Mary,
I think she looks spectacular.

1051
01:28:38,746 --> 01:28:40,805
Here comes the tragic storm.

1052
01:28:40,882 --> 01:28:44,648
The waves are billowing
in a hair-raising illusion

1053
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:46,778
of an actual storm at sea.

1054
01:29:33,768 --> 01:29:36,896
My God! Mary!

1055
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:41,303
Stop this!

1056
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:44,436
Bring this savagery to an end!
Stop it!

1057
01:29:44,512 --> 01:29:45,979
Teddy!

1058
01:29:46,147 --> 01:29:47,614
Teddy!

1059
01:30:44,505 --> 01:30:45,563
Are you all right?

1060
01:30:48,075 --> 01:30:49,565
Just look at me.

1061
01:30:51,012 --> 01:30:52,639
What do you think?

1062
01:30:52,713 --> 01:30:54,044
I think it can be fixed!

1063
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:57,107
Anything that's built can be rebuilt.

1064
01:30:57,752 --> 01:31:00,016
Come on. We'll get past this.
I promise you.

1065
01:31:00,087 --> 01:31:01,850
Let me lean on you.

1066
01:31:02,623 --> 01:31:05,285
- Help me out of here, please.
- Of course.

1067
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:08,121
I don't know what
I was thinking. I'm sorry.

1068
01:31:08,196 --> 01:31:10,061
But, listen,
are you sure you wanna leave...

1069
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:21,670
Well, now you've given me
something to laugh about.

1070
01:31:22,944 --> 01:31:25,674
I take it
the judge's decision is final?

1071
01:31:25,746 --> 01:31:26,872
Go to hell, Chester!

1072
01:31:27,648 --> 01:31:28,808
In due time.

1073
01:31:30,952 --> 01:31:33,352
First I'm gonna have
my victory cigar.

1074
01:31:38,726 --> 01:31:40,387
God help me, I've earned it.

1075
01:32:56,837 --> 01:32:59,431
I hear music

1076
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:03,241
When I look at you

1077
01:33:04,645 --> 01:33:11,645
The beautiful theme
of every dream I ever knew

1078
01:33:14,555 --> 01:33:17,718
Down deep in my heart

1079
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:21,888
I hear it play

1080
01:33:22,663 --> 01:33:25,791
I feel it start

1081
01:33:27,335 --> 01:33:29,335
Then melt away

1082
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:41,241
I hear music

1083
01:33:42,216 --> 01:33:45,049
When I touch your hand

1084
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:53,621
A beautiful melody
from some enchanted land

1085
01:33:55,529 --> 01:33:58,760
Down deep in my heart

1086
01:34:00,134 --> 01:34:02,193
I hear it say

1087
01:34:03,604 --> 01:34:09,839
Is this the day?

1088
01:34:31,565 --> 01:34:32,623
Get out of here!

1089
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:48,171
Keep playing.
Let's hear it all!

1090
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:58,686
I alone have heard this happy strain

1091
01:35:01,829 --> 01:35:04,730
I alone

1092
01:35:04,799 --> 01:35:10,032
Have heard this glad refrain

1093
01:35:10,104 --> 01:35:15,542
Must it be forever inside of me?

1094
01:35:15,609 --> 01:35:19,409
Why can't I let you know?

1095
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:23,209
Why can't I let it go?

1096
01:35:23,284 --> 01:35:30,284
Why can't I let you know
the song my heart would sing?

1097
01:35:31,325 --> 01:35:34,658
A beautiful melody

1098
01:35:34,729 --> 01:35:39,723
Of love and youth and spring

1099
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:44,169
The music is sweet

1100
01:35:44,238 --> 01:35:50,404
The words are true

1101
01:35:52,446 --> 01:35:59,446
The song is you

1102
01:36:16,504 --> 01:36:17,664
I ask you...

1103
01:36:18,706 --> 01:36:21,368
Is there anybody here
as happy as I am?
