1
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,090
Hello, Countess.
How did you get here?

2
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,583
Through the window.
Forgot to mail me
my invitation.

3
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,865
Go away.
No.

4
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:58,349
- I said go away.
- And I said no.

5
00:04:58,426 --> 00:05:01,274
What do you want now?
I had to see you
just once more.

6
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:04,189
I have nothing to say to you.
don't want you
to say anything.

7
00:05:04,257 --> 00:05:07,517
I want you to listen.
Can't we go somewhere
and talk?

8
00:05:07,584 --> 00:05:10,164
I hate you,
loathe you, despise you.

9
00:05:10,231 --> 00:05:12,091
You didn't always.
There was a time you loved me.

10
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,422
Wasn't there, Countess?
Swine.

11
00:05:26,074 --> 00:05:29,238
The Emperor will have
them shot, both of them!
Let me see.

12
00:05:29,305 --> 00:05:32,211
That the lenses
of these opera glasses
don't crack for shame.

13
00:05:32,278 --> 00:05:34,321
Isn't that the daughter
of Baron Holenia?

14
00:05:34,398 --> 00:05:37,706
Yes. Johanna Augusta
Franziska, Countess
von Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg,

15
00:05:37,783 --> 00:05:40,506
disgracing every syllable
ofher name.
But who is he?

16
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,511
That's the man,
that's the one.
That's the who?

17
00:05:42,587 --> 00:05:44,889
The man. Haven't you heard?
Where have you been?

18
00:05:44,956 --> 00:05:47,574
In a mud bath in Bad Nauheim,
trying to cure my poor heart.

19
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:50,508
I'd forgotten.
It's nothing.
Don't stop now.

20
00:05:50,585 --> 00:05:55,188
Very well, you've asked for it.
It's a love affair that has
rocked Vienna for four months.

21
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:58,996
Who is he?
The most vulgar, impossible,
obnoxious, ill-mannered...

22
00:05:59,063 --> 00:06:01,009
In one word,
an American.
No!

23
00:06:01,077 --> 00:06:03,503
Yes. And low
even among Americans.

24
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:06,063
He's what they call
a traveling salesman.

25
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,305
A traveling salesman
and a baron's daughter.

26
00:06:09,372 --> 00:06:11,856
You heard about the attempt
on the Emperor's life?
That's the man.

27
00:06:11,932 --> 00:06:15,222
Mercy!
He swindled an appointment
with His Majesty...

28
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:18,099
by presenting himself
as a great potentate.

29
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:21,014
Later, it transpired he was
a very minor potentate...

30
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,603
in an American organization
known as the Shriners.

31
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:27,123
I remember the day he came
to the palace with his
nasty little dog...

32
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,904
and a mysterious,
sinister black box.

33
00:06:29,971 --> 00:06:32,426
Do you know what was
in that box?

34
00:06:32,503 --> 00:06:36,051
[Whistling]

35
00:06:47,702 --> 00:06:50,186
[Whistling Stops]

36
00:06:50,263 --> 00:06:52,306
How are you today?

37
00:07:00,505 --> 00:07:02,509
Will you follow me,
please?
Mm-hmm.

38
00:07:37,014 --> 00:07:38,951
Here, Buttons.
Stop chewing that gum.

39
00:07:39,027 --> 00:07:41,617
Here, give it to me.
Come here.

40
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:50,641
[Barks]

41
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,808
[Barking Continues]
[Growling]

42
00:07:52,885 --> 00:07:56,740
[Barking, Whining]
Scheherazade, please.
Remember your manners.

43
00:07:56,817 --> 00:07:59,598
And do stop fidgeting
with your moustache.
I'm not nervous.

44
00:07:59,665 --> 00:08:02,053
I know perfectly well
why the Emperor
has summoned us.

45
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:04,584
So do I. He's found out
You belong in jail.

46
00:08:04,661 --> 00:08:08,459
You're talking to your father.
That's what's so depressing.
My own father, a scoundrel.

47
00:08:08,526 --> 00:08:11,345
Mortgaging the mortgage
on our castle which was
already mortgaged.

48
00:08:11,412 --> 00:08:14,155
How was I to know?
I'm not a businessman:
I'm a general.

49
00:08:14,222 --> 00:08:17,675
Then taking the money and
gambling it away in a night.
The cards were marked.

50
00:08:17,742 --> 00:08:23,083
Two duels already this season,
named as corespondent in the
divorce of some pastry baker,

51
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,059
sued by a young lady in
the chorus at the opera...

52
00:08:25,136 --> 00:08:27,370
because you promised her
the lead in Aida.

53
00:08:27,437 --> 00:08:28,847
The little fool.

54
00:08:28,885 --> 00:08:31,916
I'm not the director
of the opera, I'm a general.

55
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:35,272
As I was trying to say
16 insults ago,

56
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,804
I don't believe
the Emperor summoned us
on account of me at all.

57
00:08:37,871 --> 00:08:39,731
He summoned us
on account of you.

58
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:45,063
Me? What have I done?
have an idea someone has
expressed an interest in you...

59
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,048
and the Emperor wants
to arrange a marriage.

60
00:08:47,115 --> 00:08:50,088
Oh, nonsense. His Majesty
knows I'm still in mourning.

61
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:53,320
Two years of mourning
for a husband you
couldn't endure is enough.

62
00:08:53,387 --> 00:08:56,552
Yes, I see a highly satisfactory
new marriage.

63
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,112
Some member of the Belgian
diplomatic corps,

64
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,318
or perhaps
a Russian duke.

65
00:09:01,395 --> 00:09:05,614
I like Russians, don't you?
Money just oozes from them.

66
00:09:05,681 --> 00:09:08,779
And, dear Papa,
You could always
mortgage the Kremlin.

67
00:09:08,846 --> 00:09:10,697
[Door Opens]

68
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,764
His Excellency
the General Baron Holenia...

69
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,391
and the Countess
von Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg.

70
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,319
[Barking]

71
00:09:26,386 --> 00:09:29,541
[Barking]

72
00:09:36,206 --> 00:09:38,661
Oh, Baron Holenia.
[Coughs]

73
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:41,413
My dearJohanna.
Oh, get up.

74
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,029
Sorry I can't kiss your hand.
[Coughs]
Bad cold.

75
00:09:45,096 --> 00:09:47,273
And how is
Scheherazade?

76
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,344
You're wearing new perfume,
aren't you?

77
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:52,106
Even I can smell it
with my stuffed up nose.

78
00:09:52,173 --> 00:09:54,062
Oh, sit down, do.
[Coughs]

79
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,776
Louis, come on.
Say hello to Scheherazade.

80
00:09:56,843 --> 00:09:59,433
[Barking]

81
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,077
Why do they always
pick a damp day for me
to inaugurate a bridge...

82
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,894
or open a horticultural
exhibition, or...

83
00:10:06,951 --> 00:10:11,458
Oh, well. Mustn't grumble.
It's the hazard
of the profession.

84
00:10:11,535 --> 00:10:13,539
If I may be permitted
a suggestion,

85
00:10:13,606 --> 00:10:16,541
has Your Majesty tried
pine needles in boiling water,

86
00:10:16,618 --> 00:10:18,526
inhaling the vapor
under a towel?

87
00:10:18,603 --> 00:10:20,645
Pine needles?
Certainly not.

88
00:10:20,713 --> 00:10:23,647
Shouldn't want
my whiskers to smell
like old Christmas trees.

89
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:27,272
[Coughing, Sniffling]
Has, uh, anything
particular come up lately?

90
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:31,597
You ask that?
Look at my desk.

91
00:10:31,655 --> 00:10:35,548
Reports, complaints,
unforgivable stupidities,

92
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:38,473
downright dishonesty,
thievery!

93
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,132
Go on,
look at them.

94
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:42,625
I'd rather not,
Your Majesty.

95
00:10:42,693 --> 00:10:44,774
I don't blame you.
[Coughing]

96
00:10:44,841 --> 00:10:48,072
Now, do you know why
I summoned you here today?

97
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,278
Yes. I mean, no.
I mean...

98
00:10:50,345 --> 00:10:52,800
We have rather
an inkling, Your Majesty.

99
00:10:52,877 --> 00:10:56,483
Then what are you looking
so gloomy about? Don't you
approve of the alliance?

100
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,897
Alliance?
A marriage!

101
00:10:59,974 --> 00:11:02,400
Do you or don't you know
what 'm talking about?

102
00:11:02,476 --> 00:11:04,385
Yes. I mean, no.
I mean...

103
00:11:04,452 --> 00:11:06,725
We have rather
an inkling, Your Majesty.

104
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:09,093
This match
means a great deal to me.

105
00:11:09,161 --> 00:11:12,805
I've given it infinite thought.
I've looked up the blood lines
on both sides.

106
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:16,037
Fine, fine. One couldn't
ask for better.
Thank you, Your Majesty.

107
00:11:16,104 --> 00:11:18,693
I broughtJohanna up to realize
that blood comes first.

108
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,433
What pleases me most,
both lines are very prolific.

109
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,502
Oh, little embarrassing
to talk about this.
Not at all, Your Majesty.

110
00:11:25,578 --> 00:11:27,679
I anticipate
superb offspring.

111
00:11:27,746 --> 00:11:30,019
And I'm going to be
a little greedy about them.

112
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:32,675
Greedy?
Well, I'm a lonely man.

113
00:11:32,742 --> 00:11:35,197
I've lost my wife,
my son.

114
00:11:35,274 --> 00:11:38,333
It'll warm my heart
to see the little things
crawling around.

115
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:42,716
A great honor.
If there are five, I want three.
Is that exorbitant?

116
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:45,851
Your Majesty!
Don't be picayune, if it will
give the Emperor any happiness.

117
00:11:45,928 --> 00:11:47,961
As for the bridegroom,
Yes, Your Majesty.

118
00:11:48,038 --> 00:11:51,481
I think the union should be
brought about as quickly
as possible.

119
00:11:51,557 --> 00:11:56,343
Of course, Your Majesty.
Spry as he is, he's
a rather elderly gentleman.

120
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:58,395
How old, Your Majesty.
Twelve.

121
00:11:58,472 --> 00:12:02,941
Twelve!
Johanna, what possible
import... Twelve?

122
00:12:03,008 --> 00:12:04,983
Not quite. He will be
on the seventh of September.

123
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,841
I suggest that the nuptials
take place in my kennels.

124
00:12:07,908 --> 00:12:12,128
Kennels? With all
that barking going on?
We're talking about the poodles.

125
00:12:12,195 --> 00:12:15,973
His Majesty's dog is asking
for the paw of Scheherazade.

126
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,275
Ohhh. Of course.
I'm no fool.

127
00:12:18,342 --> 00:12:21,852
Scheherazade, did you hear
of your engagement?
What do you say?

128
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:24,316
[Barking]

129
00:12:24,384 --> 00:12:26,522
How about
a piece of sugar?
[Barking Continues]

130
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:27,711
I'd love it.

131
00:12:29,063 --> 00:12:30,684
[Barking Continues]

132
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:33,532
[Barking]

133
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:40,197
Buttons,
come here, come here.
Pull yourself together.

134
00:12:40,255 --> 00:12:43,640
You'll spoil the sale for me.
You want to eat, don't you?

135
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:48,128
[Ticking]

136
00:12:50,593 --> 00:12:52,453
[Exhales]

137
00:12:52,511 --> 00:12:57,219
[Ticking Continues]

138
00:12:59,262 --> 00:13:01,650
Must have wound
the mainspring too tight.

139
00:13:01,726 --> 00:13:06,330
[Chuckles]
It's not supposed to do that
'til I pull the switch.

140
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:11,518
[Ticking Continues]

141
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:22,584
There's a plot on the life
of the Emperor. A time bomb!
That black box!

142
00:13:27,677 --> 00:13:29,240
What's the matter?

143
00:13:30,429 --> 00:13:32,769
Oh, I guess you'd
like to know what this is.

144
00:13:32,836 --> 00:13:35,646
I'm not telling.
I'm gonna work it
on the Emperor first.

145
00:13:35,713 --> 00:13:37,919
What a bang he's
gonna get out of it.
This is gonna kill him!

146
00:13:37,986 --> 00:13:42,234
Ho-ho! Am I laughing?
Got a match? Here we are.

147
00:13:42,301 --> 00:13:45,053
He'll be in sections.
This is gonna kill him.

148
00:13:46,684 --> 00:13:50,366
[Ticking Continues]

149
00:13:55,065 --> 00:13:58,844
[Bell Ringing]

150
00:14:05,183 --> 00:14:07,551
You'll pardon my intrusion,
Your Majesty.

151
00:14:07,609 --> 00:14:09,978
Will Your Majesty please
make all the haste possible?

152
00:14:10,045 --> 00:14:12,663
What is it now?
A precautionary measure,
Your Majesty.

153
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:15,990
There seems to be
an assassin.
Oh, dear.

154
00:14:16,537 --> 00:14:19,193
This gets to be
such a bore. Sorry.

155
00:14:41,241 --> 00:14:44,089
Here. Here now!
What's the idea?
Come here!

156
00:14:44,156 --> 00:14:48,596
Hey, wait a minute!
Hey, you! Wait a minute!

157
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:55,318
[Barking]

158
00:14:59,452 --> 00:15:02,233
What's the matter with you?
Are you crazy?
You're under arrest!

159
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,014
Let go of me!
And drop that dog,
You dogs!

160
00:15:05,081 --> 00:15:08,879
Search him! Now,
who are your confederates?
We want every name.

161
00:15:08,955 --> 00:15:11,410
Is this the Emperor's palace
or a loony bin?

162
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,971
You came here as a potentate.
Are you a potentate?

163
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,972
I may have stretched things
a little, but I'm a Shriner.
Paid up.

164
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:20,310
You're a nihilist.
I am not.
I'm a Presbyterian.

165
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,861
A lie again. It says here
that you're a salesman.

166
00:15:22,937 --> 00:15:26,610
Listen, wabble-face,
isn't it possible to be a
Presbyterian Shriner salesman?

167
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:29,199
You're trying to confuse me.
I am also
a registered Democrat,

168
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:32,307
a member
of the Chamber of Commerce,
a sandlot third baseman, and l...

169
00:15:32,374 --> 00:15:34,234
Not so fast!
I have to talk fast.

170
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:36,948
If I don't, my sample's
gonna rust in your fish pond.

171
00:15:41,494 --> 00:15:43,316
Careful!
It might explode.

172
00:15:43,383 --> 00:15:45,454
I wish it would.
It cannot.
The powder's all wet.

173
00:15:45,531 --> 00:15:47,698
It must be some new model
with a cannon attached.

174
00:15:47,765 --> 00:15:50,901
You must be an old windbag
with a blabbermouth attached.

175
00:15:50,968 --> 00:15:54,708
I never saw such a bunch
of ignoramuses. Here, Buttons,
we'll show 'em the trademark.

176
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,067
Does that mean anything to you?
It doesn't, hey?

177
00:16:01,143 --> 00:16:03,560
Well, it's an invention.
A talking machine.

178
00:16:03,637 --> 00:16:06,840
A new kind of American
thingamabob. Watch this.

179
00:16:06,907 --> 00:16:09,717
We have a record, we put it
on the machine thus.

180
00:16:09,784 --> 00:16:13,131
We start the works
in this manner. Drop
the needle in that fashion.

181
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:18,635
[Garbled Song]

182
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:23,411
[Stops]
Something wrong here.
What do you... What's going on?

183
00:16:23,478 --> 00:16:26,288
This is not
standard equipment.

184
00:16:43,156 --> 00:16:46,350
With Your Majesty's permission,
Your Majesty may come out now.

185
00:16:46,417 --> 00:16:49,831
About time. I was beginning
to feel like a corkscrew.

186
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,660
What was it this time?
A false alarm,
Your Majesty.

187
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:55,278
An American salesman
trying to force his way in.

188
00:16:55,345 --> 00:16:57,714
A most persistent breed,
these Americans.

189
00:16:57,781 --> 00:17:00,083
One threw himself
in front of my carriage.

190
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,631
He was selling brushes.
Wanted me to buy two
for my whiskers.

191
00:17:03,698 --> 00:17:07,083
Also a clothes brush,
shoe brush, nail brush
and a tooth brush.

192
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,536
Incredible.
We finally bought a mop
and had him deported.

193
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,806
Where were we now?
The dogs, Your Majesty.
The final arrangements.

194
00:17:13,873 --> 00:17:16,558
Oh, yes. Louis and I
will be at my hunting lodge
in the Tyrol...

195
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,486
for the next three weeks.

196
00:17:18,543 --> 00:17:21,161
I want you to come
and stay with me
and bring Scheherazade.

197
00:17:21,238 --> 00:17:23,501
We are most honored,
Your Majesty.
I think the happy couple...

198
00:17:23,568 --> 00:17:25,774
will find the mountain air
quite invigorating.

199
00:17:25,841 --> 00:17:29,006
As to transportation,
have you any objections
to the horseless carriage?

200
00:17:29,073 --> 00:17:32,870
None whatever, Your Majesty.
Then I'll send my automobile
to bring you up next Tuesday.

201
00:17:32,947 --> 00:17:35,047
Good-bye, Baron.
Good-bye, my dearJohanna.

202
00:17:35,124 --> 00:17:37,704
May I personally
guarantee Your Majesty
a most glorious litter?

203
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,003
Thank you.
I shall see you
in the mountains.

204
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,141
Everybody return
to his quarters.

205
00:17:43,218 --> 00:17:45,807
No tradesperson
is permitted in the palace.

206
00:17:45,874 --> 00:17:49,796
You will pack that
squalling abomination
and leave at once!

207
00:17:49,873 --> 00:17:52,424
Out! Out! Out!
Oh, no, I don't.

208
00:17:52,501 --> 00:17:55,435
I'm gonna wait 'til it dries
and show it to the old boy,

209
00:17:55,502 --> 00:17:57,363
as per
my appointment!

210
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,847
To whom will you show it?
To the Emperor.

211
00:17:59,923 --> 00:18:03,404
If you play ball,
I won't tell him what a monkey
You made out of yourself.

212
00:18:03,472 --> 00:18:05,064
You will never see
the Emperor.

213
00:18:05,102 --> 00:18:08,401
I'd protect His Majesty
from that object as I'd
protect him from a bomb.

214
00:18:08,468 --> 00:18:11,757
You listen to me, chubby.
I didn't come to Austria
to run into that kind of guff.

215
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,896
I came here to put that machine
over and I'm gonna.

216
00:18:13,963 --> 00:18:16,360
I'm gonna sell 5,000,
10,000, 20,000.

217
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,470
Not in Austria,
I assure you.

218
00:18:18,547 --> 00:18:20,714
We do not take to cheap,
blatant innovations.

219
00:18:20,781 --> 00:18:23,438
You're a bunch of
dusty old aunties,
scared of anything new.

220
00:18:23,505 --> 00:18:25,356
You wouldn't have put in
the electric light,

221
00:18:25,423 --> 00:18:27,331
bought an automobile,
only the Emperor did.

222
00:18:27,408 --> 00:18:30,093
He's gonna buy
the first one of these
and endorse it.

223
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,217
And when he does,
You watch the sales skyrocket.
Yo-ho! They're going up.

224
00:18:34,284 --> 00:18:36,557
And perhaps you will take
a photograph of our Emperor...

225
00:18:36,624 --> 00:18:38,858
Iooking into that horn,
in place of your dog.

226
00:18:38,925 --> 00:18:41,745
Don't you realize this is
the greatest thing that's
happened to the Holenia's...

227
00:18:41,774 --> 00:18:45,322
in ten generations?
Will it pay
the butcher's bill?

228
00:18:45,389 --> 00:18:48,582
What butcher would dare
present his bill to the
Emperor's brother-in-law?

229
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:50,759
What was that?
My poor demented daughter,

230
00:18:50,826 --> 00:18:54,087
don't you realize
we've just become part
of the Emperor's family?

231
00:18:54,154 --> 00:18:56,293
All because of some
arrangement about puppies?

232
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:58,249
Thanks to those puppies
Your father is now...

233
00:18:58,287 --> 00:19:01,251
the most important man
in the monarchy, inseparable
from the Emperor.

234
00:19:01,327 --> 00:19:03,907
He and I will sit together
waiting for them to be born.

235
00:19:03,984 --> 00:19:06,180
We'll feed the little things
with medicine droppers,

236
00:19:06,256 --> 00:19:08,711
spread newspapers for them,
take them on walks.

237
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:12,193
I shall have
the Emperor's ear and
advise him on matters of state.

238
00:19:12,269 --> 00:19:14,638
I may become
ambassador to Paris,

239
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:17,697
or minister of finance.
Oh, not that, Father.

240
00:19:17,774 --> 00:19:21,063
As for you, Johanna,
magnificent vistas
have opened up.

241
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:25,091
What's wrong with
the young king of Spain? Or
there's an English princeling.

242
00:19:25,168 --> 00:19:27,910
Father, to return
to the butcher,
how are we to provide...

243
00:19:27,978 --> 00:19:31,075
meat for the bride
if she's to be kept alive
for the happy event?

244
00:19:31,152 --> 00:19:34,460
Don't be ridiculous.
We now have all the credit
in the world.

245
00:19:34,537 --> 00:19:37,356
So Vienna thought
we had gone to the dogs?

246
00:19:37,414 --> 00:19:41,413
[Chuckles]
Gone to the dogs,
indeed.

247
00:19:42,027 --> 00:19:46,150
Stop dawdling. We've
endured your presence
long enough.

248
00:19:46,217 --> 00:19:48,835
Aw, your emperor's
sideburns!

249
00:19:48,903 --> 00:19:52,681
What are you
doing now? Disrobing
in the palace grounds?

250
00:19:52,748 --> 00:19:55,616
What a fussy old dude you are.
You're worse than a worm
on a hot rock.

251
00:19:55,692 --> 00:19:58,982
I'll give you
one more minute to get
that object out of here!

252
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:01,916
That's what's known
as Viennese charm, Buttons.

253
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:03,719
If you ever see me order
Wiener schnitzel again,

254
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:07,881
You can spit
right in my eye!
[Barking]

255
00:20:07,948 --> 00:20:10,211
Here, Buttons.
Come back here.

256
00:20:12,676 --> 00:20:16,263
[Growling]

257
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:18,746
[Dogs Barking, Growling]

258
00:20:18,823 --> 00:20:21,096
Hey, Buttons.
Go away,
You nasty mongrel.

259
00:20:21,163 --> 00:20:25,440
What are you up to?
You bad dog, you. Here.

260
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:27,780
What's the matter?

261
00:20:27,847 --> 00:20:29,755
Hey.! Hey, you.!

262
00:20:29,832 --> 00:20:32,316
This dog is bleedin'.
What did you do to my dog?

263
00:20:32,393 --> 00:20:34,244
Stop! Hey!
That's enough.
That's enough.

264
00:20:34,311 --> 00:20:37,725
You bet it is. We've been
kicked around, thrown in
the water, snapped at, bitten.

265
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:39,652
Who do those people
think they are?

266
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:41,724
They are His Excellency,
Baron Holenia...

267
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,281
and the Countess
von Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg.
Where do they live?

268
00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:49,376
The Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg
palace on
Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg Square.

269
00:20:49,443 --> 00:20:53,510
That's a lot of Stolzenberg.
And don't tell us to get out
'cause we're gittin'.

270
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:04,960
[Bell Ringing]

271
00:21:11,433 --> 00:21:14,626
[Bell Rings, Crashes]

272
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,939
You rang, sir?
Does a black dog live here?

273
00:21:20,006 --> 00:21:23,008
I beg your pardon?
A French poodle
about that size.

274
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:25,079
Tell her she has to see
a man about a dog.

275
00:21:25,156 --> 00:21:29,347
Perhaps if you would clarify the
nature of your business, sir.
[Scheherazade Barking]

276
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:30,363
Hey, you!

277
00:21:31,879 --> 00:21:34,842
What's the idea ofjust
running off after your dog
has bitten my dog?

278
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:38,687
I don't expect decent manners
of that thing, but human beings
we expect to act halfway human.

279
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:42,169
[Growling]
Take off your hat.

280
00:21:44,451 --> 00:21:48,191
Look at that leg.
Bitten clear to the bone.
It bled all over my rented suit.

281
00:21:48,258 --> 00:21:51,260
I doubt if my birds
care for the smell of your hat.

282
00:21:51,327 --> 00:21:54,050
Fry your birds!
I'm talkin' about my dog.

283
00:21:54,118 --> 00:21:56,505
Your dog ought to have a muzzle
and not a leather muzzle,
a steel one.

284
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:58,433
[Growling]
Don't let him upset you,
darling.

285
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,818
Look at that silly haircut.
Who trims her, the guy that
trims your hedges?

286
00:22:01,895 --> 00:22:05,856
What is it that you want?
Damages for your mongrel, money
for cleaning your trousers?

287
00:22:05,923 --> 00:22:09,308
I want
a saliva test made of her
and I want it now!

288
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:12,348
You want what?
A saliva test.
She may be mad.

289
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:14,688
That silly lookin' thing
may have the rabies!

290
00:22:14,755 --> 00:22:17,785
I'll thank you
not to use such vile words
when you talk about her.

291
00:22:17,862 --> 00:22:20,797
All right, hydrophobia, then.
Have you watched her
for symptoms?

292
00:22:20,864 --> 00:22:24,690
Has she been
frothing at the mouth?
Does her bark sound croupy?

293
00:22:24,767 --> 00:22:28,152
My dear man, if either of these
two dogs is mad, it's yours.

294
00:22:28,229 --> 00:22:31,096
My veterinary
goes over Scheherazade
from snout to tail every week.

295
00:22:31,173 --> 00:22:34,040
She's a dog of superb pedigree
and she gets superb care.

296
00:22:34,117 --> 00:22:36,447
Oh, listen, any mutt
can have rabies.

297
00:22:36,514 --> 00:22:39,267
For the last time, will you stop
referring to her as a mutt?

298
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:42,489
Have you ever heard
of blood lines? Hers
goes back to the 18th century.

299
00:22:42,556 --> 00:22:45,788
Hmpf. His goes back to as far
as they've been havin' dogs.

300
00:22:45,855 --> 00:22:49,432
Perhaps you've heard of one
of her ancestors, Papillion,
the poodle of Marie Antoinette.

301
00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:51,925
They were both guillotined
in the French Revolution.
Smart move.

302
00:22:52,002 --> 00:22:54,236
Her father belongs
to Czar Nicholas of Russia.

303
00:22:54,304 --> 00:22:56,279
You don't say.
Her mother
to the Infanta of Spain.

304
00:22:56,356 --> 00:22:59,799
His mother belongs to a milkman
in Springfield, Illinois.
And his father...

305
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:01,841
His father. Well,
You've got me there.

306
00:23:01,918 --> 00:23:04,766
Her twin brothers
belong to a Cardinal
and live in the Vatican.

307
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:07,221
As for Scheherazade herself,
she has just become engaged...

308
00:23:07,298 --> 00:23:10,194
to the dog of His Majesty,
Francis Joseph the First.

309
00:23:10,271 --> 00:23:14,097
Yeah? Well, Buttons' brother
helps a kid named Stinky O'Hara
deliver newspapers...

310
00:23:14,174 --> 00:23:16,341
and his sister was making an
honest living as a watchdog...

311
00:23:16,418 --> 00:23:18,326
until she was hit
by the Baltimore and Ohio.

312
00:23:18,403 --> 00:23:20,858
How really fascinating.
f your poodle
is so classy...

313
00:23:20,925 --> 00:23:23,610
how come she doesn't know better
than to go around biting
a nice little dog?

314
00:23:23,677 --> 00:23:26,008
If your animal is so clever,
it should know better
than to approach a dog...

315
00:23:26,075 --> 00:23:27,935
of an entirely
different class.

316
00:23:28,002 --> 00:23:30,457
All he did is go up to her
and say, "How do you do?"
That's all.

317
00:23:30,524 --> 00:23:33,018
He thrust his ugly,
ill-bred little face
right at hers.

318
00:23:33,085 --> 00:23:34,169
And for that
she bit him.
Certainly.

319
00:23:34,207 --> 00:23:37,813
And she was right?
Absolutely. There are such
things as class distinctions.

320
00:23:37,889 --> 00:23:39,894
How's that?
Class distinctions,
I said.

321
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:43,126
I thought that's what you said.
Two kinds of blood you mean?

322
00:23:43,193 --> 00:23:45,983
Blue blood and the kind we have.
The kind you get at the
five and ten cent store.

323
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:48,697
Precisely. You must admit
there's a difference
between...

324
00:23:48,764 --> 00:23:51,958
Stinky O-something-or-other
and the Emperor of Austria.

325
00:23:52,025 --> 00:23:54,039
There is the lowbred
and the highbred.

326
00:23:54,106 --> 00:23:56,532
If the lowbred
has the impertinence
to come distastefully close,

327
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:59,093
what can he expect
but to be bitten?

328
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,433
Is that so?
It is.

00:24:10,716 --> 00:24:13,947

I would have horsewhipped him
then and there, the revolting
little plebian.

334
00:24:46,649 --> 00:24:49,679
You saw him. Ears like
a bat and the rest of him
like a plucked duck.

335
00:24:49,756 --> 00:24:52,748
Perhaps there's more to him
than meets the eye.

336
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,676
So it would seem
from what happened
in the mountains.

337
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:58,866
What happened?
A conflagration
of the wildest passion...

338
00:24:58,933 --> 00:25:01,935
Please! Remember
the archduchess's heart.
Go on. What happened?

339
00:25:02,012 --> 00:25:04,083
For your own sake, Isabella.
Oh, go on,

340
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,452
or I shall fling myself
from this balcony.

341
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:09,338
All right, it's your heart.
It seems that
that little horror...

342
00:25:09,396 --> 00:25:11,256
found out the Emperor
was going to the Tyrol.

343
00:25:11,324 --> 00:25:15,955
So being an American... They'll
do anything in their mad pursuit

hear that loathsome apparatus.

00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:46,485
The first train out of here.
You, your apparatus and dog.
Especially that dog.

481
00:34:46,553 --> 00:34:49,554
We'll fix you in Washington.
What we'll do
to your ambassador.

482
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:53,812
We'll boycott your product!
The Blue Danube forbidden
by act of congress!

483
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:56,334
[Yodeling]

484
00:34:58,386 --> 00:35:00,755
[Yodeling]

485
00:35:00,822 --> 00:35:02,673
Shut up!

486
00:35:10,872 --> 00:35:14,286
[Knocking]
Johanna.
Come in, Father.

487
00:35:14,996 --> 00:35:17,863
Aren't you getting dressed?
They're all downstairs
on the terrace.

488
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,012
Quiet, Father.
Have you glanced
out the window?

489
00:35:20,088 --> 00:35:23,282
The Emperor has invited us
with a group that offers rather
interesting possibilities.

490
00:35:23,349 --> 00:35:26,763
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing. It's Scheherazade.

491
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,582
What's wrong now?
The Emperor's veterinary
is with her.

492
00:35:29,649 --> 00:35:33,361
- She's had a nervous breakdown.
- A nervous...

493
00:35:33,428 --> 00:35:36,429
No!
A complete collapse.

494
00:35:36,497 --> 00:35:38,702
They were bathing her and
she was perfectly all right...

495
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:41,359
'til she saw another dog,
a small dachshund.

496
00:35:41,426 --> 00:35:44,178
She began screaming.
They tested her
with another dog,

497
00:35:44,245 --> 00:35:46,959
a tiny Chihuahua:
the same hysteria.

498
00:35:47,026 --> 00:35:49,328
When they brought in the
Emperor's dog to calm her,

499
00:35:49,395 --> 00:35:51,917
she broke loose,
jumped through a window
and ran amok.

500
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:54,353
Apparently, she can't stand
the sight of another dog.

501
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,724
Has the Emperor
been told?
Not yet.

502
00:35:55,763 --> 00:35:58,285
We hope the veterinary will
be able to do something.

503
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:01,459
That inconsiderate,
ungrateful black animal!

504
00:36:01,488 --> 00:36:04,528
Jeopardizing
all our chances!

505
00:36:05,074 --> 00:36:06,925
Come here.

506
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,786
The Hungarian officer
playing cards,

507
00:36:15,863 --> 00:36:18,702
that's Prince stvan
Barlossy de Baloshasa.

508
00:36:18,769 --> 00:36:20,629
[Johanna]
met him in Budapest.
Didn't like him very much.

509
00:36:20,687 --> 00:36:24,580
Nonsense. Since then
he's inherited half of Buda
and a large part of Pest.

510
00:36:24,657 --> 00:36:28,234
What have you against
the Marques Alonso Lafuente?
Which one is he?

511
00:36:28,301 --> 00:36:31,916
The handsome one
with the tennis racket.
Greatest family in Andalusia.

512
00:36:31,984 --> 00:36:36,328
Castles in Spain, literally.
Seven of them.

513
00:36:36,404 --> 00:36:38,955
You still haven't mentioned
the best possibility.

514
00:36:39,023 --> 00:36:40,883
Do you mean
Duke Ferdi Lindendorf?

515
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,760
No, the Princess Bitotska.
I'm thinking of you, Father.

516
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:46,694
Don't be disgusting.
She's had her one good eye
on you for years.

517
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:49,936
She's old enough
to be my mother.
She still plays tennis.

518
00:36:50,003 --> 00:36:52,851
She ought to be in a wheelchair,
the arthritic old horror.

519
00:36:52,909 --> 00:36:56,006
Let's go and see if that beast
of yours is feeling any better.

520
00:36:59,315 --> 00:37:04,263
I repeat: It is extremely
important that the patient
speak anything in her mind.

521
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:07,850
[Whining]
Anything at all.
We need a complete
stream of consciousness.

522
00:37:07,917 --> 00:37:10,918
Is that clear?
[Whining]

523
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:14,821
Thank you very much.
Now, I would like
to know all about your dreams.

524
00:37:14,898 --> 00:37:18,245
You dream,
I presume?
[Whines]

525
00:37:18,322 --> 00:37:21,928
All right.
What do you dream?
[Whines]

526
00:37:21,995 --> 00:37:25,294
Is it a recurrent dream?
[Whines]

527
00:37:25,361 --> 00:37:29,388
Very good.
A typical anxiety dream.
What is all this, Doctor?

528
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:32,553
Please! This is
a very serious case.

529
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:37,808
Indubitably a psychoneurosis,
sometimes referred to
as a neuropsychosis.

530
00:37:37,866 --> 00:37:39,976
Fortunately, I went
to the University of Vienna...

531
00:37:40,043 --> 00:37:42,114
with a young doctor
by the name Freud.

532
00:37:42,191 --> 00:37:44,454
He has created
a curative method:

533
00:37:44,521 --> 00:37:49,163
the analysis of the psyche by
delving into the subconscious.
[Dog Whining]

534
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:54,274
Now I must ask
for your earliest recollections.

535
00:37:54,351 --> 00:37:57,957
Your father and mother:
Was their home life congenial?

536
00:37:58,024 --> 00:37:59,884
[Whining, Barking]

537
00:37:59,951 --> 00:38:03,691
Doctor, stop torturing her.
I can tell you what's wrong.
She-She had a fight with a dog.

538
00:38:03,759 --> 00:38:07,911
She did?
Twice. Once in Vienna and
once this very afternoon.

539
00:38:07,978 --> 00:38:11,526
[Johanna] The same dog.
You see? That's what leads
to wrong diagnoses.

540
00:38:11,593 --> 00:38:14,375
Patients withhold things.
What kind of a dog?

541
00:38:14,442 --> 00:38:16,964
American.
Small, white, male.

542
00:38:17,031 --> 00:38:18,891
What was his name?
Buttons.

543
00:38:18,959 --> 00:38:20,646
Let's test it.

544
00:38:23,111 --> 00:38:27,235
- Buttons!
- [Yelping]

545
00:38:27,311 --> 00:38:31,051
Absolutely clear now.
A fear complex.

546
00:38:31,118 --> 00:38:33,506
Frightened by one dog,
now afraid of all dogs.

547
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:36,067
I may kill her.
Is there a cure?

548
00:38:36,134 --> 00:38:39,270
In some cases.
The patient has developed what
I and my colleague, Dr. Freud,

549
00:38:39,337 --> 00:38:41,197
call a mental block.

550
00:38:41,255 --> 00:38:43,298
What is the cure,
Doctor?

551
00:38:43,374 --> 00:38:46,597
The frightened one
must realize she has
nothing to be afraid of.

552
00:38:46,664 --> 00:38:48,572
In other words, we must
bring the two dogs together.

553
00:38:48,649 --> 00:38:50,595
That's impossible.
It is imperative.

554
00:38:50,663 --> 00:38:52,935
I gave orders
to have them both removed.
The man and the dog.

555
00:38:53,003 --> 00:38:56,512
I may kill you.
Without the other dog,
I see very black.

556
00:38:56,589 --> 00:39:00,099
Maybe it's not too late.
Come, darling,
don't tremble like that.

557
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:02,851
Don't be nervous.
Everything's going to be...

558
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:19,164
With your very kind permission,
exactly what inn was it?

559
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,021
The Fiddle Inn.
There are three Fiddle Inns:
the Green Fiddle,

560
00:39:22,089 --> 00:39:24,707
the Golden Fiddle
and the Broken Fiddle.
How idiotic.

561
00:39:24,774 --> 00:39:27,430
With your very kind permission,
the whole village is fiddles.

562
00:39:27,497 --> 00:39:29,348
That's what they make here.
Fiddles.

563
00:39:29,415 --> 00:39:32,100
I've got to find him
before it's too late.

564
00:39:32,168 --> 00:39:36,905
[Whistling]

565
00:39:50,436 --> 00:39:54,215
The American, has he left?
No, but he is leaving.
Number seven.

566
00:39:54,282 --> 00:39:56,133
[Giggling]

567
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:07,516
If you do not hurry
You will miss the train.

568
00:40:07,593 --> 00:40:10,815
So we miss the train. So what?
So you will be pulled
out of here by ox cart.

569
00:40:10,882 --> 00:40:13,855
I think you're full of
pickled pumpernickel,
the both of you.

570
00:40:13,922 --> 00:40:16,128
[Sighing]

571
00:40:16,195 --> 00:40:19,714
All right, you little
bundle of joy. Come on.

572
00:40:19,781 --> 00:40:22,198
Up! In you go.

573
00:40:24,193 --> 00:40:26,369
Well, if it isn't
the Countess!

574
00:40:26,437 --> 00:40:28,287
Don't you trust them?
We're leaving.

575
00:40:28,355 --> 00:40:31,490
Step outside, you two.
And close the door.
I have to talk to you.

576
00:40:31,558 --> 00:40:33,725
We'll miss the train.
You're not going
on that train.

577
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,931
What are you gonna do,
shoot us out of a cannon?

578
00:40:36,007 --> 00:40:38,520
I need your help.

579
00:40:38,597 --> 00:40:40,764
Well. You don't say.

580
00:40:40,831 --> 00:40:43,133
My dog is outside
in a state of
complete collapse.

581
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,655
Small wonder. You people
take those high-strung critters,

582
00:40:45,731 --> 00:40:47,621
breed them, interbreed them,
over breed them,

583
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:49,539
something in their noggins
is bound to start rattling.

584
00:40:49,606 --> 00:40:51,581
She was perfectly all right
until she saw your dog...

585
00:40:51,648 --> 00:40:54,497
All Buttons
did was walk up...
Let's not go into it.

586
00:40:54,564 --> 00:40:56,702
I'm here to demand
Your cooperation.

587
00:40:56,769 --> 00:40:58,975
The reason for Scheherazade's
breakdown is fear...

588
00:40:59,042 --> 00:41:00,893
and the reason for her fear
is your dog.

589
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,218
The only cure is to get back
to the source of that fear, thus
eliminating the mental block.

590
00:41:05,285 --> 00:41:08,661
Are you following me?
Countess, you lost me back there
around "cooperation."

591
00:41:08,738 --> 00:41:12,152
To put it simply,
if she could realize
he is not a danger.

592
00:41:12,228 --> 00:41:14,233
If your dog could be
nice to my dog.

593
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:16,477
Oh, no. She might
throw a flea on him.

594
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,749
I assure you
this is a matter
of the utmost importance.

595
00:41:18,816 --> 00:41:20,725
It goes far beyond
just curing a dog.

596
00:41:20,802 --> 00:41:23,420
So we do you a favor
and you kick us out.
Is that it?

597
00:41:23,487 --> 00:41:26,488
No, you can stay as long
as you like, do what
You like. I don't care.

598
00:41:26,565 --> 00:41:28,416
Well, now you're
talkin' sense.

599
00:41:28,483 --> 00:41:31,130
I'll bring her in.
There's no time to waste.
See that your dog behaves.

600
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,786
Hold it, Countess,
there's a word missing.
I beg your pardon?

601
00:41:33,853 --> 00:41:36,404
- The word is please.
- Please.

602
00:41:36,481 --> 00:41:39,444
Ah-ah-ah-ah.
You can do better than that.

603
00:41:39,521 --> 00:41:42,551
Please.
Come again.

604
00:41:43,108 --> 00:41:45,850
- Please.
- Getting warmer.

605
00:41:47,615 --> 00:41:51,230
- Please.
- Bring in the mutt!

606
00:41:52,736 --> 00:41:54,587
Leopold.

607
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:58,969
Put her
on the bed here.
[Dog Whimpering]

608
00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:04,723
She's got it
pretty bad, huh?
[Buttons Growling]

609
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,651
Here, you, quiet.
Shh!

610
00:42:06,718 --> 00:42:10,228
The doctor says that
she might go c-r-a-z-y.

611
00:42:10,304 --> 00:42:13,623
We'll see
what we can d-o.
[Growling]

612
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:15,771
[Scheherazade Whines]
Now, now, now.

613
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:19,386
Don't say no until you and I
have had a chance to talk,
man to man.

614
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:22,867
I'm gonna open this basket and
You're gonna go and apologize
like a little gentleman.

615
00:42:22,944 --> 00:42:24,795
You understand?
[Growling]

616
00:42:24,862 --> 00:42:28,640
- Don't open the basket.
- Let me handle this.
Come on, Buttons.

617
00:42:28,698 --> 00:42:30,808
Come on, boy.
Gotta help me out now.

618
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:32,821
Remember that time in Munich
when you became involved
with the police...

619
00:42:32,889 --> 00:42:35,257
'cause you lapped up
all that beer in the ratskeller.

620
00:42:35,324 --> 00:42:37,693
Who got you out of that?
Old Virgil, huh?

621
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,119
We won't talk about it
now, no.

622
00:42:40,186 --> 00:42:42,680
You've gotta help me out.
Go over there and apologize.

623
00:42:42,747 --> 00:42:46,257
Go on. All right,
so she did hurt your feelings.
[Growling]

624
00:42:46,334 --> 00:42:48,376
So she's snooty
and highfalutin.

625
00:42:48,443 --> 00:42:51,061
But you're a pretty fresh
little mutt yourself, you know.

626
00:42:51,129 --> 00:42:54,907
But you're a man and it's
up to the man to apologize.
Now go ahead. Go on.

627
00:42:54,974 --> 00:42:56,825
[Barking]
[Whining]

628
00:42:56,892 --> 00:42:59,347
Her heart's
beating like mad.

629
00:42:59,424 --> 00:43:03,279
Proud, huh? And stubborn.
Look at her.

630
00:43:03,356 --> 00:43:07,153
For once in your life
You meet a real lady.
And a mighty pretty one.

631
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:09,647
Look at those trim
little ankles, hmm?

632
00:43:09,723 --> 00:43:12,658
And that pompadour.
[Whistles]

633
00:43:12,735 --> 00:43:16,379
That's super deluxe,
that's class. It's better
than class: it's "claaass."

634
00:43:16,446 --> 00:43:19,160
Go on, be nice to here.
Go ahead, move in.

635
00:43:19,227 --> 00:43:22,190
Take charge. Atta boy.
Go on, Buttons.

636
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:25,652
[Barks,
Whining]

637
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:28,500
Don't be afraid, Scheherazade.
He's a nice little dog.

638
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:30,840
Maybe he hasn't had
some of the advantages.

639
00:43:30,907 --> 00:43:33,113
[Whining]
It's no use.
Maybe we'd better stop.

640
00:43:36,374 --> 00:43:39,308
[Whispering]
Hey, Buttons. Hey.

641
00:43:42,262 --> 00:43:46,289
kiss your little hand,
madame

642
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:48,438
Your dainty fingertips

643
00:43:48,505 --> 00:43:53,683
And while in slumberland,
madame

644
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:56,244
I'm begging for your lips

645
00:43:56,311 --> 00:44:00,176
haven't any right, madame
I think she likes that.

646
00:44:00,252 --> 00:44:03,120
Sometimes I wonder

647
00:44:03,196 --> 00:44:05,584
If hearts are broken

648
00:44:05,651 --> 00:44:10,955
By little love words
that are left unspoken

649
00:44:11,031 --> 00:44:13,784
I always tremble

650
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:16,210
When you are near me

651
00:44:16,277 --> 00:44:19,825
I'm looking for
a ray of hope

652
00:44:19,892 --> 00:44:23,028
To cheer me

653
00:44:23,095 --> 00:44:28,466
I hope to keep
my kisses warm

654
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:32,944
Until we meet
in shadow form

655
00:44:33,011 --> 00:44:35,150
[Piano]

656
00:44:35,227 --> 00:44:41,230
In dreams I kiss your hand,
madame

657
00:44:41,297 --> 00:44:44,116
Your dainty fingertips

658
00:44:46,581 --> 00:44:52,018
And while in slumberland,
madame

659
00:44:52,086 --> 00:44:55,404
I'm begging
for your lips

660
00:44:57,398 --> 00:45:03,248
I haven't any right,
madame

661
00:45:03,315 --> 00:45:06,547
To do the things
I do

662
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:13,011
Just when I hold you tight,
madame

663
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:19,887
You vanish with the night,
madame

664
00:45:19,954 --> 00:45:24,969
In dreams I kiss your hand,
madame

665
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:29,102
And pray my dreams

666
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:32,238
Come true

667
00:45:49,654 --> 00:45:54,324
I'm just putting it on a little
to give them the idea.

668
00:45:54,381 --> 00:45:56,242
Oh.

669
00:45:57,325 --> 00:46:01,708
[Whining]

670
00:46:07,471 --> 00:46:11,749
Nothing personal,
You understand.
Oh, I understand perfectly.

671
00:46:11,825 --> 00:46:15,690
I wouldn't presume...
No, of course you wouldn't.

672
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:29,576
[Violins]

673
00:47:30,731 --> 00:47:32,620
[Giggling]

674
00:48:23,494 --> 00:48:28,232
haven't any right,
madame

675
00:48:28,299 --> 00:48:33,448
To do the things I do

676
00:48:33,516 --> 00:48:39,174
Just when I hold you tight,
madame

677
00:48:39,241 --> 00:48:44,956
You vanish with the night,
madame

678
00:48:45,033 --> 00:48:47,843
[Scatting]

679
00:48:53,194 --> 00:48:56,004
[Scatting Continues]

680
00:49:08,451 --> 00:49:12,767
Thank you so much.
You've been most kind.

681
00:49:12,834 --> 00:49:16,478
Oh, not at all. It's a pleasure
to do business with you.

682
00:49:21,474 --> 00:49:23,814
Good-bye.

683
00:49:23,882 --> 00:49:25,732
Good-bye.

684
00:49:34,085 --> 00:49:36,732
Oh, Countess.
Yes?

685
00:49:36,809 --> 00:49:40,069
You forgot something.
I did? What?

686
00:49:40,136 --> 00:49:42,754
Your d-o-g.

687
00:49:42,822 --> 00:49:45,152
Oh, of course.

688
00:49:49,065 --> 00:49:51,961
He has missed the train.
What train?

689
00:49:52,037 --> 00:49:55,519
The one he was going on.
Oh, he's not going.

690
00:50:02,884 --> 00:50:05,252
Scheherazade.
Scheherazade.

691
00:50:05,319 --> 00:50:07,707
Buttons.
[Whistling]

692
00:50:07,774 --> 00:50:11,131
[Barking]

693
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:19,925
She seems
so wonderfully well.
Doesn't she, though?

694
00:50:20,001 --> 00:50:22,178
Come on, Scheherazade,
come on.

695
00:50:22,245 --> 00:50:24,547
Come on, Buttons.
Here, boy.

696
00:50:24,614 --> 00:50:27,453
Come on, Scheherazade,
Give Buttons back his ball.

697
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,205
Oh, no. Let her have it.
Compliments of the house.

698
00:50:30,272 --> 00:50:32,660
You're very kind.
Good-bye.

699
00:50:32,737 --> 00:50:34,588
So long, Countess.
Come on, Scheherazade.

700
00:50:34,655 --> 00:50:37,436
If she should
have a relapse,
bring her back.

701
00:50:37,503 --> 00:50:40,821
Thank you so much.
Any time.

702
00:50:40,898 --> 00:50:42,998
Go on home,
You two.

703
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:55,637
[Panting]

704
00:50:55,714 --> 00:50:57,977
[Sighing]
You're telling me.

705
00:51:22,048 --> 00:51:26,009
It's the biggest stag
they've had up here in years,
Your Majesty. I saw it myself.

706
00:51:26,076 --> 00:51:29,077
Already I can see its head
above Your Majesty's desk.

707
00:51:29,154 --> 00:51:31,705
Those magnificent antlers,
18 points.

708
00:51:31,772 --> 00:51:34,198
You can see the antlers but
I don't seem to see the stag.

709
00:51:34,275 --> 00:51:36,826
It is up there in the glen,
I assure, Your Majesty.
Listen.

710
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:41,084
Every morning for a week they've
promised me that stag and no
stag. Not a shadow of a stag.

711
00:51:41,151 --> 00:51:46,166
Today it will be there.
It must be. That stag dare not
disappoint His Emperor again.

712
00:51:46,234 --> 00:51:49,590
Look at all those other men,
Putzi. I'm very angry with you.

713
00:51:49,657 --> 00:51:51,901
Do you mind, Princess?
I do not like the name Putzi.

714
00:51:51,968 --> 00:51:56,696
Not only am I angry, I'm
disappointed. I did hope you'd
wear those short leather pants.

715
00:51:56,763 --> 00:51:59,832
Why?
For years I've wanted
to see your knees.

716
00:51:59,899 --> 00:52:02,239
You must have very good knees,
my dear Putzi.

717
00:52:02,297 --> 00:52:05,145
They're handsome knees.
They're my knees
and I'm nobody's Putzi.

718
00:52:05,212 --> 00:52:08,530
Aren't you being a little cold
to the richest woman
in Austria?

719
00:52:08,607 --> 00:52:12,692
Not rich enough. Besides,
I have other prospects.

720
00:52:13,728 --> 00:52:16,442
Such an exciting contrast,
Countess.

721
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:20,498
You, pale and blond
against the brunette
Spanish landscape.

722
00:52:20,575 --> 00:52:25,207
Spain is for bulls.
For a beautiful woman
is Hungary... is Budapest,

723
00:52:25,274 --> 00:52:28,956
that wicked boudoir of a city.
No, entirely too much paprika,
don't you think, Countess?

724
00:52:29,024 --> 00:52:32,725
Let me show you Granada:
toreadors, orange trees,

725
00:52:32,792 --> 00:52:36,178
a thousand fountains
dancing in a sunlight.

726
00:52:36,254 --> 00:52:39,735
You offer the Countess
sunlight. I offer her
fierce midnights...

727
00:52:39,803 --> 00:52:42,555
and czardas
and wild gypsies.

728
00:52:42,622 --> 00:52:47,225
[Humming]

729
00:52:52,758 --> 00:52:57,400
[Humming Stops]
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did someone say something?

730
00:53:19,965 --> 00:53:22,995
There,
Your Majesty.

731
00:53:44,151 --> 00:53:47,411
[Marching Music
Blaring]

732
00:53:47,478 --> 00:53:51,189
[Continues]
What is it?
Music here in my own forest?

733
00:53:51,257 --> 00:53:53,673
[Continues]

734
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:57,682
How dare they?
How dare they?
I don't know, Your Majesty.

735
00:53:57,749 --> 00:54:01,575
I want my stag!
It must be a band
marching down the highway.

736
00:54:01,652 --> 00:54:04,913
Maybe it's an echo from
the village.
I want that band
apprehended.

737
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:07,981
I will have them punished.
Every instrument,
especially the brasses!

738
00:54:08,058 --> 00:54:11,702
Your Majesty, may offer
my profound apologies?
You may not!

739
00:54:11,769 --> 00:54:14,800
Oh, certainly not.
Silence!

740
00:54:16,056 --> 00:54:20,113
[Continues]

741
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:22,452
Turn that thing off.
Hi, Countess.

742
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:25,550
Turn it off immediately.
Now that I got him here?
You're crazy.

743
00:54:25,617 --> 00:54:28,110
Stop it, I tell you.
You're gonna scratch
my record.

744
00:54:28,178 --> 00:54:31,822
You scared off the Emperor's
stag. They're combing the woods
with loaded guns.

745
00:54:31,889 --> 00:54:34,574
Let me demonstrate...
Did you find that band?

746
00:54:34,641 --> 00:54:37,230
Not yet, Countess.
They must be hiding
in the underbrush.

747
00:54:37,298 --> 00:54:41,843
Who is this man?
A tourist
picking strawberries.

748
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:45,037
What is that?
Uh... well, that's what
I was asking.

749
00:54:45,104 --> 00:54:48,336
It's apparently
for the strawberries.
How?

750
00:54:48,403 --> 00:54:50,886
How. Oh-Oh, "how?"

751
00:54:50,963 --> 00:54:54,128
Oh, why you... You put
the strawberries in here...

752
00:54:54,195 --> 00:54:57,647
and then you grind them up
with this, you see, and the jam
collects down yonder.

753
00:54:57,714 --> 00:55:01,646
This, uh, black platter...
You serve them
on the platter.

754
00:55:01,713 --> 00:55:03,574
The hole is
for the juice.

755
00:55:03,631 --> 00:55:06,949
Any other questions,
please?

756
00:55:08,081 --> 00:55:10,737
Yes. Will it work
with gooseberries?

757
00:55:10,805 --> 00:55:13,653
Gooseberries.
Great with gooseberries,

758
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:16,079
huckleberries,
strawberries, raspberries.

759
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:19,857
It's particularly
smashing with raspberries.
You get the jam and the sound.

760
00:55:19,925 --> 00:55:22,226
You see?
Go find the band.

761
00:55:22,293 --> 00:55:24,144
Yes, Countess.
Yes, Countess.

762
00:55:27,309 --> 00:55:29,649
Thank you, Countess.
You're a pip.
I'm a what?

763
00:55:29,716 --> 00:55:32,746
A sweetheart.
Put down that gun
and have a chair.

764
00:55:32,813 --> 00:55:36,227
I'm afraid you'll have to
think up another scheme
for your talking machine.

765
00:55:36,304 --> 00:55:38,347
Say, how's Scheherazade?
She's much better.

766
00:55:38,414 --> 00:55:40,274
Too bad.
What did you say?

767
00:55:40,332 --> 00:55:45,002
I said too bad. Buttons and I
were hoping she'd have a relapse
and you'd have to come back.

768
00:55:45,069 --> 00:55:49,193
That won't be necessary.
She's as gay as a lark,
busy with her wedding plans.

769
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:53,192
Being trimmed, a new collar,
sniffing over her wedding
presents.
Is that right?

770
00:55:53,259 --> 00:55:56,903
Buttons and I keep talking
about you, night and day.
No sleep. No appetite.

771
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:01,612
Oh, I'm so sorry.
You don't suppose, do you, that
that mental block business...

772
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:06,349
Now, could that be contagious?
Nonsense! Buttons is a sturdy,
well-adjusted little dog.

773
00:56:06,416 --> 00:56:10,636
Oh, I know Buttons is
but I'm talking about me. I'm
the one that's got the shivers.

774
00:56:10,703 --> 00:56:13,637
[Laughs]
Don't laugh. One night there'll
be a knock at your door.

775
00:56:13,714 --> 00:56:17,358
When you come to open it,
Buttons will be standing there,
with me in his arms.

776
00:56:17,425 --> 00:56:20,360
Like you came with Scheherazade.
He'll put me down...

777
00:56:20,427 --> 00:56:22,700
and I'll lie there
quaking all over,

778
00:56:22,767 --> 00:56:25,701
with my eyes rolled back until
just the white is showing.

779
00:56:25,778 --> 00:56:29,863
There'll be nasty gossip at the
castle.
We'll sneak up the
servant's stairs.

780
00:56:29,931 --> 00:56:33,997
There I'll be, lying there
in pitiable condition.

781
00:56:34,064 --> 00:56:37,094
You'd have to help me then,
wouldn't you?
How?

782
00:56:37,161 --> 00:56:40,911
You'd bend over me...
You remember the cure we found.

783
00:56:40,969 --> 00:56:43,970
I never sing.
Well, come on,
force yourself.

784
00:56:44,047 --> 00:56:48,170
Just hum a little, huh?
[Humming]

Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg.

787
00:57:01,165 --> 00:57:03,716
Countess
von Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg!

788
00:57:03,792 --> 00:57:05,643
Good-bye.

789
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:09,316
Oh, wait,
Countess, don't go.
Don't you feel it too?

790
00:57:09,383 --> 00:57:12,107
Feel what, Mr. Smith?
Oh, that funny stir
inside of you.

791
00:57:12,174 --> 00:57:15,780
Those bubbles that start down
in the tips of your toes and
tingle up through your spine...

792
00:57:15,847 --> 00:57:18,695
'til they reach
Your brain where they pop
like a firecracker.

793
00:57:18,762 --> 00:57:22,147
I know nothing about
any such bubbles.
They're in your veins.

794
00:57:22,215 --> 00:57:25,446
They beat in your throat
and pound in your ears.
What does, Mr. Smith?

795
00:57:25,513 --> 00:57:28,745
Your blood. It's all out
of whack. It goes so fast
and it goes every which way.

796
00:57:28,812 --> 00:57:32,485
Mine's going counterclockwise.
How's yours?
Perfectly normal, I assure you.

797
00:57:32,552 --> 00:57:35,621
I don't believe it.
Mine's the weak, watery
different sort of blood.

798
00:57:35,688 --> 00:57:39,553
You said so yourself.
Aww.

799
00:58:01,801 --> 00:58:04,995
[Virgil]
n dreams kiss your hand,
madame

800
00:58:07,239 --> 00:58:10,269
Your dainty
fingertips

801
00:58:12,101 --> 00:58:15,994
And while in slumberland,
madame
[Scheherazade Whining]

802
00:58:17,606 --> 00:58:20,540
'm begging
for your lips
[Whining Continues]

803
00:58:20,617 --> 00:58:23,714
Go to sleep,
Scheherazade.

804
00:58:23,781 --> 00:58:26,917
Go to sleep.
[Singing ndistinct]

805
00:58:26,984 --> 00:58:29,372
[Whining Continues]

806
00:58:29,449 --> 00:58:32,096
La di di
da do-do-do
Now, really.

807
00:58:32,163 --> 00:58:34,340
Scheherazade,
come back to bed.

808
00:58:34,407 --> 00:58:36,824
Da da di di
da da dum
Scheherazade.

809
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:39,681
[Whining]

810
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:44,256
Stop thinking about him.
He's just an ordinary little dog
like a million other dogs.

811
00:58:44,323 --> 00:58:47,804
[Whining Continues]
All right, he has some charm
and he knows some tricks,

812
00:58:47,881 --> 00:58:51,870
but he's not for you:
he's not your sort.

813
00:58:51,937 --> 00:58:55,620
I think I better
give you a sleeping pill.
It'll relax you. Come on.

814
00:58:55,687 --> 00:58:58,717
Come to bed.
Come on.

815
00:58:59,753 --> 00:59:02,688
Get in.
That's a good girl.

816
00:59:02,755 --> 00:59:06,332
[Whines]
Take this and lie down
and go to sleep.

817
00:59:14,243 --> 00:59:18,137
[Whining]
Oh, go to sleep, do.

818
00:59:18,214 --> 00:59:23,363
Tomorrow you're going to be the
most important dog in Austria.
You want to look your best.

819
00:59:25,416 --> 00:59:28,954
[Whines]
Scheherazade, you're an adult,
intelligent woman.

820
00:59:29,031 --> 00:59:34,114
A little self control,
a little dignity.
Is that too much to ask?

821
00:59:34,181 --> 00:59:38,525
What would happen
if we all let ourselves go?
[Moaning]

822
00:59:38,592 --> 00:59:43,032
[Sighs]
Just make up your mind to this.
It cannot be.

823
00:59:43,109 --> 00:59:46,206
Shut out every thought
in that direction.

824
00:59:46,274 --> 00:59:49,179
Fight it.
Suppress it.

825
00:59:49,246 --> 00:59:52,929
[Virgil]
n dreams
kiss your hand

826
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:58,903

'm begging

829
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:14,142
haven't any right,
madame

830
01:00:14,209 --> 01:00:17,076
To do the things do

831
01:00:19,397 --> 01:00:22,619
Just when
hold you tight

832
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:28,670
You vanish
with the night
[Whines]

833
01:00:30,243 --> 01:00:33,657
A fine pair we make.
Di da da da di

834
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:43,736
[Coughs]
Not another cold,
Your Majesty?

835
01:00:43,803 --> 01:00:46,364
Certainly not.
The same one.

836
01:00:46,431 --> 01:00:51,350
I might again suggest inhaling
the vapor of pine needles.
No, Holenia, no.

837
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:57,881
[Man]
Forty-15.

838
01:01:04,795 --> 01:01:08,689
Any news from the kennels?
We took Scheherazade down
after luncheon.

839
01:01:08,766 --> 01:01:12,544
She asked me to
thank Your Majesty
for the bridal bouquet.

840
01:01:12,601 --> 01:01:15,325
You've seen poodle puppies,
haven't you, Holenia?

841
01:01:15,392 --> 01:01:19,794
Charming little beasts.
Look as if they were made
of black wool and licorice.

842
01:01:19,871 --> 01:01:21,175
[Princess]
Good shot.

843
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,728
If I might be excused,
Your Majesty.

844
01:01:39,165 --> 01:01:42,292
What is it?
What's happening?
She's run away. She's gone.

845
01:01:42,368 --> 01:01:44,401
It's a disgrace
to our kennels.
Well, where is she?

846
01:01:44,478 --> 01:01:47,576
I don't know. She just
jumped over a six-foot fence
and disappeared.

847
01:01:47,643 --> 01:01:49,618
That filthy animal.
I must inform
His Majesty.

848
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:52,246
You will do nothing of the kind.
We mustn't disquiet the Emperor.
He has a cold.

849
01:01:52,284 --> 01:01:55,833
Then what am I to do?
We'll catch her.
We'll bring her back.

850
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:58,105
You return to the kennels.
That's an order.
But...

851
01:01:58,173 --> 01:01:59,793
Yes, Baron.

852
01:02:05,691 --> 01:02:08,443
[Man]
Advantage, receiver.

853
01:02:09,978 --> 01:02:12,759

Johanna. Johanna.

854
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:19,826
[Man]
The game.
Johanna.

855
01:02:19,894 --> 01:02:21,975
Yes, Father?
We're in trouble.

856
01:02:22,042 --> 01:02:24,631
What is it?

857
01:02:37,433 --> 01:02:40,665
Scheherazade!
Scheherazade!

858
01:02:49,402 --> 01:02:51,291
[Bleating]

859
01:02:57,812 --> 01:03:00,238
[Holenia]
Scheherazade.!

860
01:03:01,331 --> 01:03:04,266
Scheherazade!
Look at the silly beast!

01:03:42,386 --> 01:03:45,742
Scheherazade.
Scheherazade.
Where's Scheherazade?

865
01:03:45,809 --> 01:03:48,590
I don't know.
For heaven's sake, don't just
lie there. She's run away.

866
01:03:48,657 --> 01:03:52,043
She must be with Buttons.
Where's Buttons?

867
01:03:52,119 --> 01:03:55,763
Look at there. You threw me
off. What's your problem?
Where's Buttons?

868
01:03:55,831 --> 01:03:58,247
He isn't here.
He's not?
Where is he?

869
01:03:58,324 --> 01:04:01,191
He got feeling so miserable
I put him out on the island.
What island?

870
01:04:01,268 --> 01:04:03,272
Out here.
I'll show you.

871
01:04:03,829 --> 01:04:06,197
He was unhappy,
crying all night
and everything,

872
01:04:06,264 --> 01:04:10,925
I thought if I disconnected him
from the mainland, put him on
that island...
Look!

873
01:04:10,992 --> 01:04:13,380
That idiot.!
[Virgil]
That wonderful gal.

874
01:04:13,457 --> 01:04:17,322
No mountain too high.
No ocean too wide.
Go it, Scheherazade!

875
01:04:17,398 --> 01:04:19,757
Oh, I hate you.
The way, you say it,
I don't mind it.

876
01:04:19,824 --> 01:04:22,864
We've got to stop her.
Oh, forget her. Stick around,
I'll open up a bottle of glue.

877
01:04:22,932 --> 01:04:27,717
I've gotta catch her
and you're going to help me.
Wait a minute. Wait.

878
01:04:34,861 --> 01:04:37,518
Johanna,
what is it?

879
01:04:37,585 --> 01:04:40,903

Scheherazade!
Do you know how
to row this thing?

885
01:05:03,602 --> 01:05:06,450
Sure. I used to travel
for a Venetian blind company.

Hold it, Buttons.
I'm a'comin'.

Oh, boy,
You're all mixed up here.
He isn't hurt, is he?

899
01:05:53,297 --> 01:05:57,574
No, not him, he's too tough.
You kept telling me
she didn't care, huh?

900
01:05:57,641 --> 01:06:00,940
Don't let him
off that leash.
Oh, don't worry.

901
01:06:01,007 --> 01:06:04,105
Well, you've had your moment,
You lucky little coot.

902
01:06:04,172 --> 01:06:07,653
It isn't every guy, you know,
to have the lovely Countess
swim across a lake for them.

903
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:11,786
Stop trembling,
Scheherazade.
I won't scold you. No.

904
01:06:11,853 --> 01:06:15,363
I won't even mention it
to anybody, ever.
I promise.

[Violins Tuning Up]

906
01:06:21,616 --> 01:06:25,442
What's that noise?
Oh, that? That, uh,
comes from the village.

907
01:06:25,519 --> 01:06:30,026
You know, in the daytime
they make violins,
and in the evening, they fiddle.

908
01:06:31,052 --> 01:06:33,987
[Violins]

909
01:07:38,153 --> 01:07:41,471
[Continues]

910
01:07:43,465 --> 01:07:46,218
Mighty pleasant,
isn't it?

911
01:07:46,275 --> 01:07:49,248
It's probably due
to the echo.
Yeah.

912
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:52,767
Like sittin' way up
in the balcony, huh?

913
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:56,134
No, no, no, we must go back,
Scheherazade and I.
Oh?

914
01:07:56,201 --> 01:08:00,353
Well, then I'll...
I'll get Buttons ready
for the night.

915
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:04,103
You can say
Your lips

916
01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:07,545
Are not for me

917
01:08:08,965 --> 01:08:13,338
But you can't hide
the kiss

918
01:08:13,414 --> 01:08:16,263
That's in your eyes...
Would you mind
not singing?

919
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:18,977
What was that?
I said,
please stop singing.

920
01:08:19,044 --> 01:08:22,237
Oh, sure.

921
01:08:22,314 --> 01:08:25,411
What's a matter, Countess?
You afraid or something?
Afraid?

922
01:08:25,479 --> 01:08:30,302
You know, this
silly island, the silly sunset,
all those fiddles tearing away,

923
01:08:30,369 --> 01:08:33,026
a man's voice.
You have to be
more explicit.

924
01:08:33,093 --> 01:08:36,478
But you needn't be afraid.
It's just that... sometimes
sounds do funny things.

925
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:40,736
Now, you take a big chandelier,
one of those high-class,
well brought up chandeliers,

926
01:08:40,803 --> 01:08:44,927
and you hit
a particular note, ping.

927
01:08:44,994 --> 01:08:47,516
You make that chandelier
tinkle all over.

928
01:08:47,583 --> 01:08:52,733
Are you under the impression
that your voice could, as you
put it, make me... tinkle?

929
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,619
Well, yes, maybe,
a little around the edges.

930
01:08:55,687 --> 01:08:58,535
Who do you think I am?
Some half-witted shop girl...

931
01:08:58,592 --> 01:09:01,249
or some maudlin
little waitress
from a beer garden?

932
01:09:01,316 --> 01:09:04,730
You're a chandelier,
Countess.

933
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:07,588
The loveliest chandelier
I ever saw.

934
01:09:07,655 --> 01:09:10,589
Go on, sing.
Oh. No.

935
01:09:10,656 --> 01:09:14,205
This is insulting.
Sing and sing at once!

936
01:09:19,297 --> 01:09:23,123
You can say
Your lips

937
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:26,067
Are not for me

938
01:09:27,813 --> 01:09:32,186
But you can't hide
the kiss

939
01:09:32,253 --> 01:09:35,389
That's in your eyes

940
01:09:37,316 --> 01:09:41,986
And you can say
my arms

941
01:09:42,044 --> 01:09:46,302
Would only
leave you cold

942
01:09:47,357 --> 01:09:52,180
But wait 'til
they hold you

943
01:09:52,257 --> 01:09:56,601
And then
look wise

944
01:09:57,532 --> 01:10:01,876
Yes
and you can say

945
01:10:01,953 --> 01:10:05,817
Tonight will come
and go

946
01:10:08,033 --> 01:10:15,158
Without a single
moment's worth of sighs

947
01:10:17,085 --> 01:10:22,139
But why
should I agree

948
01:10:22,206 --> 01:10:26,905
When I know
what will be

949
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:31,029
It's plain to me

950
01:10:31,106 --> 01:10:35,891
Plain as the kiss

951
01:10:35,968 --> 01:10:44,282
In your eyes

952
01:10:46,008 --> 01:10:49,691
Plain as the kiss...

953
01:10:49,758 --> 01:10:51,695
Stop it!

954
01:11:07,423 --> 01:11:11,067
I had a husband.
He was suave
and distinguished.

955
01:11:11,134 --> 01:11:14,135
He was dark and dashing.
He was six feet two.

956
01:11:14,203 --> 01:11:17,051
He was the handsomest man
in Austria.

957
01:11:17,118 --> 01:11:19,535
You're so different.

958
01:11:37,113 --> 01:11:41,908
Imagine, a thousand years of
civilization crumbling because
of a drummer's vocal chords.

959
01:11:41,975 --> 01:11:45,111
Isn't it utterly
past belief?
Aren't you a little harsh?

960
01:11:45,178 --> 01:11:48,918
I remember once when
I was listening to Caruso.
[Sighs]

961
01:11:48,985 --> 01:11:53,492
Caruso is excusable,
but that man's voice is...
A cheap bathroom yowl.

962
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:56,590
Ah, Therese, think of
their nearness and the lake...

963
01:11:56,667 --> 01:11:59,563
and the fragrance
of the summer night
in the Tyrol.

964
01:11:59,639 --> 01:12:02,938
Why begrudge them a moment
of happiness?
Had it only stopped there.

965
01:12:03,005 --> 01:12:06,477
But for two whole weeks
they were having secret
rendezvous on that island.

966
01:12:06,554 --> 01:12:10,744
The four of them.
How shocking!
How divinely shocking!

967
01:12:14,427 --> 01:12:17,141
[Virgil Whistling]

968
01:12:25,139 --> 01:12:29,205
[Continues]

969
01:12:39,159 --> 01:12:42,161
Could I trouble you
for another kiss,
honey Countess?

970
01:12:42,228 --> 01:12:44,980
No trouble at all.

971
01:12:47,186 --> 01:12:50,485
[Sighs]
I shall never
forget you, Virgil.

972
01:12:50,552 --> 01:12:53,717
Impertinent, unpardonable,
ridiculous Virgil.

973
01:12:53,784 --> 01:12:57,044
You bet you won't because I'm
gonna be around to remind you.
You are?

974
01:12:57,111 --> 01:13:00,756
I got it all worked out,
honey Countess. You pack
Your bags. I pack mine.

975
01:13:00,823 --> 01:13:03,920
We get the dogs. Take
the first train, first boat,
and then one day your folks...

976
01:13:03,987 --> 01:13:06,893
are gonna get a postcard
from Newark, New Jersey.

977
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:11,822
It'll say,
"Merry Christmas from
Mr. And Mrs. Virgil H. Smith."

978
01:13:11,889 --> 01:13:15,025
It sounds so wonderful,
and so impossible.
Oh, a few small problems.

979
01:13:15,092 --> 01:13:18,737
A few? A million.
Where I come from,
there's only one real problem:

980
01:13:18,804 --> 01:13:21,834
Have you got two bucks
for the license,
and two bucks I got.

981
01:13:21,911 --> 01:13:24,529
Where I come from there are
traditions and conventions...

982
01:13:24,596 --> 01:13:28,240
and family ties
and responsibilities...
Oh, forget 'em, Countess.

983
01:13:28,307 --> 01:13:31,884
We can't afford
a scandal in my family.
I have a young brother.

984
01:13:31,951 --> 01:13:35,855
By the grace of the Emperor,
he's just been admitted to
the Imperial Cadet School.

985
01:13:35,922 --> 01:13:40,717
Good. So he'll hustle and get
himself a job setting up pins
in the Imperial Bowling Academy.

986
01:13:40,784 --> 01:13:45,742
I have a young sister, 17.
She's to be presented at court,
her first great glamourous ball.

987
01:13:45,809 --> 01:13:49,808
She'll call in the neighborhood
kids instead. She'll have
herself a big taffy pull.

988
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:54,449
Then there's my father, very
bankrupt and slightly dishonest.
If we affront the Emperor...

989
01:13:54,516 --> 01:13:58,985
The Emperor, the Emperor.
Nobody's that important.
The Emperor is.

990
01:13:59,062 --> 01:14:02,025
Why don't you tell him
how things are with us,
how we stand?

991
01:14:02,102 --> 01:14:04,298
That we're crazy
about each other.
Don't be naive.

992
01:14:04,365 --> 01:14:06,926
All right then,
let me talk to him.
You?

993
01:14:06,993 --> 01:14:10,819
Why, sure!
You just get me in there.
I'll tell him a thing or two.

994
01:14:10,896 --> 01:14:13,284
You're not ashamed
of me, are you?
Of course not.

995
01:14:13,361 --> 01:14:16,621
Because I have no title,
I'm just a businessman?
No, it's impossible.

996
01:14:16,688 --> 01:14:20,265
The Emperor wouldn't listen
to you. Even if he did,
he wouldn't believe his ears.

997
01:14:20,332 --> 01:14:24,456
I'll reason it out with him.
You don't reason
with an emperor, darling.

998
01:14:24,533 --> 01:14:28,656
You bow and listen to what
he has to say and what he has
to say is no. It's always no.

999
01:14:28,723 --> 01:14:32,013
And you bow again and leave.
Not me.
I don't take no's.

1000
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:36,520
I get my foot in the door and
I talk and talk and talk fast.
I'm a good salesman.

1001
01:14:36,597 --> 01:14:38,476
So I've noticed.

1002
01:14:39,982 --> 01:14:43,665
Come on, honey Countess.
Let me see him, huh?

1003
01:15:07,946 --> 01:15:10,631
I'm no saint.
Heaven knows.
I'm no Puritan.

1004
01:15:10,698 --> 01:15:14,496
I've allowed my affections
to get involved with the
lower classes more than once,

1005
01:15:14,573 --> 01:15:17,766
but I had some sense
of proportion.
I love him, Father.

1006
01:15:17,833 --> 01:15:21,065
Prettiest girl
I ever knew was the daughter
of a garbage collector.

1007
01:15:21,132 --> 01:15:25,985
But at the proper time, I had
the good taste to consign her
regretfully to the garbage can.

1008
01:15:26,061 --> 01:15:28,478
I didn't put on a silver platter
and present her to my emperor.

1009
01:15:28,555 --> 01:15:30,895
He's wonderful
and I'm proud of him.

1010
01:15:30,962 --> 01:15:34,251
He doesn't accept
our silly little prejudices.
He's better than we are.

1011
01:15:34,318 --> 01:15:38,279
Garbage! He's a cheap
little drummer with some
cheap business on his mind.

1012
01:15:38,346 --> 01:15:42,604
No, Father,
with me on his mind,
and a wonderful shining love.

1013
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:46,114
Garbage.!
[Car Approaching,
Fanfare Music]

1014
01:16:03,404 --> 01:16:06,089
Virgil.
Hello, Countess.

1015
01:16:06,157 --> 01:16:08,938
He's waiting for you.
Good.
I'm ready myself.

1016
01:16:09,005 --> 01:16:11,939
Now, don't be nervous.
Look who's talking.
Hi.

1017
01:16:12,006 --> 01:16:14,116
Garbage.
What are you
going to say?

1018
01:16:14,183 --> 01:16:18,662
I don't know, I'll do something.
I'll talk or play him a song
or stand on my hands.

1019
01:16:18,729 --> 01:16:22,114
If he doesn't like me,
maybe he'll like my associate.
He said 3:00.

1020
01:16:22,191 --> 01:16:24,579
He's got a little cold,
but I hope he's in a good mood.

1021

[Knocking At Door]

1022
01:16:28,069 --> 01:16:31,972
[Knocking Continues]
[Coughing]

1023
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:35,358
[Weakly]
Come in.
[Coughing]

1024
01:16:35,434 --> 01:16:40,191
Step inside and bow from the
waist and don't straighten up
'til he gives you the signal.

1025
01:16:40,268 --> 01:16:43,461
[Coughing Continues]
I got it. Come on, Buttons.
Keep your paws crossed.

1026
01:16:43,528 --> 01:16:47,556
I love you.
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

1027
01:16:47,623 --> 01:16:49,762

1028
01:16:49,829 --> 01:16:52,926
[Coughing]

1029
01:16:58,345 --> 01:17:02,813
[Coughing Continues]

1030
01:17:08,203 --> 01:17:11,099
Oooh.

1031
01:17:11,176 --> 01:17:15,299
Who ever told me to try
these nasty fumes?
Thank you.

1032
01:17:15,367 --> 01:17:18,215
You're quite welcome,
I'm sure.
And my whiskers.
[Sniffs]

1033
01:17:18,282 --> 01:17:22,434
Just as I thought.
Now, they smell.
You could
always shave them, Your Majesty.

1034
01:17:22,501 --> 01:17:25,024
What was that?
Come here.

1035
01:17:27,843 --> 01:17:31,257
I think you'd look
much nicer without all that...
whipped cream.

1036
01:17:31,334 --> 01:17:35,112
An excellent idea.
They've bored me
for the last 40 years.

1037
01:17:35,170 --> 01:17:38,593
Thank you, Your Honor...
I mean, Your Majesty.
Only it cannot be done.

1038
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:41,758
Why not, Your Majesty?
Young man, if I were
to shave off these whiskers,

1039
01:17:41,825 --> 01:17:44,280
Austria would be thrown
into a state of turmoil.

1040
01:17:44,357 --> 01:17:49,180
Think what it would do to
our postage stamps, our coins,
our bank notes.

1041
01:17:49,257 --> 01:17:52,412
I guess you're stuck,
all right.
I'm glad you see my point.

1042
01:17:52,489 --> 01:17:55,040
Straighten up.
Who are you?

1043
01:17:55,107 --> 01:17:58,933
I'm the man who, uh... Well,
an appointment was made for me.
I was to be here at 3:00.

1044
01:17:59,010 --> 01:18:01,024
You are Mr. Smith,
the American.

1045
01:18:01,091 --> 01:18:04,956
Yes, Your Majesty. It's
in connection with the Countess
von Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg.

1046
01:18:05,033 --> 01:18:10,432
Uh, what I want, Your Majesty...
Well, it's a hard for me to
explain exactly what I do want.

1047
01:18:10,499 --> 01:18:13,798
Exactly what you want
is the Countess
von Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg.

1048
01:18:13,855 --> 01:18:15,936
Exactly.

1049
01:18:16,003 --> 01:18:18,756
How long have you
two known each other?
Three weeks, roughly speaking.

1050
01:18:18,823 --> 01:18:22,812
Not too roughly, I trust.
[Coughing]

1051
01:18:22,879 --> 01:18:24,960
You, uh, love her,
Mr. Smith?

1052
01:18:25,027 --> 01:18:27,713
Yes, I do, Your Majesty.
And she loves me.
I know it sounds crazy...

1053
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:31,261
considering who she is
and where come from, way, way
the other side of the tracks.

1054
01:18:31,328 --> 01:18:36,315
It is somewhat unorthodox.
Should you marryJohanna, what
kind of life do you envision?

1055
01:18:36,382 --> 01:18:38,300
Do you intend to live
with her here in Vienna?

1056
01:18:38,367 --> 01:18:41,273
Move into her palace?
I should say not.

1057
01:18:41,349 --> 01:18:45,089
There's too many forks
to know which one to pick up.
I plan to take her home with me.

1058
01:18:45,157 --> 01:18:48,187
Home?
Which one of the United States
do you come from?

1059
01:18:48,254 --> 01:18:51,035
New Jersey.
Newark, New Jersey.
My mother has a place there.

1060
01:18:51,102 --> 01:18:54,008
Aplace?
That is, uh... an estate?
[Exhales]

1061
01:18:54,085 --> 01:18:57,527
No, it's a house.
Sort of a half house.
Two family deal.

1062
01:18:57,604 --> 01:19:01,939
Dr. Coleman lives in the
other half. He's a dentist. We
belong to the same bowling club.

1063
01:19:02,016 --> 01:19:06,110
[Coughing]
You and Johanna will live
with your mother?

1064
01:19:06,178 --> 01:19:08,959
Oh, yes. Wouldn't want her
alone while 'm out on the road.
On the road?

1065
01:19:09,026 --> 01:19:12,852
Look, I could've come in here
and thrown a big bluff about
being a rich Wall Street man...

1066
01:19:12,929 --> 01:19:15,681
just cruising around the world,
but actually, I don't have
a yacht to my name.

1067
01:19:15,748 --> 01:19:20,629
I'm just a traveling salesman
and I earn $22.50 a week against
four percent commission,

1068
01:19:20,706 --> 01:19:24,149
which isn't bad when you
consider what an up-and-coming
product I handle.

1069
01:19:24,226 --> 01:19:28,762
That mechanical orchestra
with which you pursued me
from Vienna to that forest?

1070
01:19:28,829 --> 01:19:32,665
I'm sorry about the stag.
Oh, I probably would have
missed him anyway.

1071
01:19:32,732 --> 01:19:36,251
I'm a very poor shot.
[Coughing]
This machine...

1072
01:19:36,318 --> 01:19:39,320
Is it practical?
Is it, uh, really good?

1073
01:19:39,387 --> 01:19:43,664
Oh, that's
the gosh darndest,
jim-dandiest machi...

1074
01:19:43,741 --> 01:19:47,251
Listen, Your Majesty, I didn't
come here to sell that machine.
I came here to sell myself...

1075
01:19:47,328 --> 01:19:50,559
so you wouldn't think
the Countess was throwing
herself away on a hoodlum.

1076
01:19:50,627 --> 01:19:54,041
You are not a hoodlum.
You are a businessman.
Yes, Your Majesty.

1077
01:19:54,108 --> 01:19:57,407
A good one, I'm sure:
quick, clever, enterprising.

1078
01:19:57,474 --> 01:19:59,612
Thank you,
Your Majesty.

1079
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:04,350
If a good proposition offered
itself, you wouldn't let it
slip through your fingers.

1080
01:20:04,417 --> 01:20:08,982
Oh, I should say not, sir.
Good. It so happens
I have one for you.

1081
01:20:09,049 --> 01:20:12,319
You have?
It's a very simple one.

1082
01:20:12,376 --> 01:20:15,829
Give upJohanna
and I will endorse that machine.

1083
01:20:15,905 --> 01:20:19,924
Come again?
I'm sure you heard
what I said.

1084
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,235
Look, you,
I love her!

1085
01:20:22,302 --> 01:20:25,467
That, Mr. Smith,
is what I am counting on.

1086
01:20:25,534 --> 01:20:29,523
I'm not narrow-minded.
I could even forgive him
being an American...

1087
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:33,973
if he belonged to one
of those Vander, Astor,
uh, Rocker families.

1088
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:37,013
But a Mr. Smith.
I love him.

1089
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,899
If you say that
once more...
I love him.

1090
01:20:39,966 --> 01:20:44,052
Garbage.
Father, if you say that
once more...

1091
01:20:44,119 --> 01:20:48,022
[Coughing]
I've seen these things
happen before, Mr. Smith.

1092
01:20:48,089 --> 01:20:51,158
I've seen them happen
over and over again.

1093
01:20:51,225 --> 01:20:54,457
There was a grandniece
of mine who ran away
with a fencing master.

1094
01:20:54,524 --> 01:20:58,197
An archduchess who fell in love
with a tourist guide in Egypt.

1095
01:20:58,264 --> 01:21:01,467
Princes have eloped
with soubrettes,
princesses with headwaiters.

1096
01:21:01,534 --> 01:21:04,660
And why not
if they loved each other?
Why not?

1097
01:21:04,727 --> 01:21:07,067
Let me tell you why not.

1098
01:21:07,135 --> 01:21:10,395
My grandniece
and her fencing master.
What happened?

1099
01:21:10,462 --> 01:21:16,091
A few beautiful months in Naples
and then she began to want to
go back to the life she left.

1100
01:21:16,149 --> 01:21:18,489
There's no going back.

1101
01:21:18,556 --> 01:21:22,641
Eventually, she threw herself
from the fifth story window
of her hotel.

1102
01:21:22,708 --> 01:21:27,695
The archduchess with her
tourist guide had less luck,
or less character.

1103
01:21:27,772 --> 01:21:31,512
She's living still... in a cheap
Viennese boarding house...

1104
01:21:31,579 --> 01:21:35,022
on sleeping pills and brandy
to forget where she came from.

1105
01:21:35,099 --> 01:21:38,541
Where she came from?
Because you're so much better
than we are?

1106
01:21:38,618 --> 01:21:40,881
I don't say
we are better.

1107
01:21:40,948 --> 01:21:43,729
As a matter of fact,
I think you are better.

1108
01:21:43,797 --> 01:21:48,208
You are simpler.
You are stronger. Ultimately,
the world will be yours.

1109
01:21:48,275 --> 01:21:50,193
You bet it will!

1110
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:55,448
What I'm trying to explain,
Mr. Smith, is that...
we are different.

1111
01:21:55,515 --> 01:21:59,792
We are like snails
living in lovely twisted
little twisted shells.

1112
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:02,583
Uh, have you ever observed
a snail, Mr. Smith?

1113
01:22:02,650 --> 01:22:05,268
They are
majestic creatures...

1114
01:22:05,335 --> 01:22:10,255
with small coronetted heads
that peer very proudly
from their tiny castles.

1115
01:22:10,322 --> 01:22:15,472
They move with dignity.
I imagine they have a great
sense of their own importance.

1116
01:22:15,539 --> 01:22:18,291
But you take them
from their shells
and they die.

1117
01:22:18,358 --> 01:22:20,363
That is us,
Mr. Smith.
Aw, that's a lot of...

1118
01:22:20,439 --> 01:22:22,290
I know my class.

1119
01:22:22,357 --> 01:22:26,318
TakeJohanna with you and you
destroy her. Do you want to
destroy someone you love?

1120
01:22:26,385 --> 01:22:29,358
I don't want to
and I'm not going to!
I'm gonna make her happy.

1121
01:22:29,425 --> 01:22:31,535
One chance
in a million.

1122
01:22:31,602 --> 01:22:34,258
Uh, bring
that apparatus here.

1123
01:22:38,679 --> 01:22:40,684
[Coughing]

1124
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:42,995
I don't know whether
she mentioned it...

1125
01:22:43,062 --> 01:22:46,159
but there are
two other offers
forJohanna's hand:

1126
01:22:46,227 --> 01:22:49,008
the Prince Baloshaza
and the Marques Lafuente.

1127
01:22:49,075 --> 01:22:51,252
And they're both idiots.
I agree.

1128
01:22:51,319 --> 01:22:53,735
No chance of
any wild love there.

1129
01:22:53,812 --> 01:22:56,143
But, uh,
let's look ahead.

1130
01:22:56,210 --> 01:22:59,595
PictureJohanna
in the two-family house
in Newark.

1131
01:22:59,672 --> 01:23:03,210
Oh, she may still love you
and yet as she dries the dishes,
won't she think:

1132
01:23:03,287 --> 01:23:06,595
"Tonight, there is
the gala opening
of the opera in Vienna.

1133
01:23:06,672 --> 01:23:11,247
"Last week should have been
at the races at Ascot
in the Royal enclosure.

1134
01:23:11,314 --> 01:23:15,658
wonder how the season is
at Biarritz. "
She won't think that.

1135
01:23:15,735 --> 01:23:17,998
Because she has you?
That's right.

1136
01:23:19,925 --> 01:23:22,342
Are you enough,
Mr. Smith?

1137
01:23:22,419 --> 01:23:25,229
Twenty-two fifty a week
with a four percent commission.

1138
01:23:33,073 --> 01:23:35,940
Play it,
please.

1139
01:23:37,072 --> 01:23:40,390
Do you think
I should go in?
No, Father.

1140
01:23:40,467 --> 01:23:44,811
On hearing such a fantastic
proposal, I wager His Majesty
fainted or had a stroke.

1141
01:23:44,878 --> 01:23:47,918
[Phonograph]
What's he playing
music for?

1142
01:23:47,985 --> 01:23:51,850
Because everything's going
so well. Because His Majesty's
listened to him.

1143
01:23:53,557 --> 01:23:58,477
And that song... Tricking
an old man into a sentimental
mood. It's not fair.

1144
01:23:58,544 --> 01:24:00,913
It's yes, it's yes.

1145
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:04,585
It's yes!
The Emperor's cracking up.
Heaven help our poor monarchy.

1146
01:24:04,653 --> 01:24:09,927
Oh, monarchy, monarchy.
Crowns, titles, crests.
Who cares, Father? Who cares?

1147
01:24:10,004 --> 01:24:13,034
[Continues]

1148
01:24:24,906 --> 01:24:27,467
Well, don't just stand there,
Virgil, what happened?

1149
01:24:29,711 --> 01:24:31,917
[Makes Clicking Sound]

1150
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:36,769
- What does that mean?
Is it all right?
- All right? It's great.

1151
01:24:36,846 --> 01:24:39,809
Oh, it's great.
Do you hear that?
What did His Majesty say?

1152
01:24:39,886 --> 01:24:42,274
Oh, exactly what
I wanted him to say.
Virgil!

1153
01:24:42,350 --> 01:24:45,314
I sure wanna thank you,
honey Countess, both for myself
and on behalf of the company.

1154
01:24:45,390 --> 01:24:49,255
Oh, it's all so wonderful.
What company?
The phonograph company.

1155
01:24:49,322 --> 01:24:52,525
They better send you
a bathtub full of roses.
Me, why?

1156
01:24:52,592 --> 01:24:55,651
Well, you helped swing
the deal, didn't you?
What deal?

1157
01:24:55,728 --> 01:24:58,346
I sold him
the phonograph.
You sold him...

1158
01:24:58,413 --> 01:25:00,648
What's he talking about?

1159
01:25:00,715 --> 01:25:04,359
Hush, Father. Go on, please.
I knew I could sell him
if I could just get to him.

1160
01:25:04,426 --> 01:25:09,451
He's a wonderful old guy.
He fell for it like that.
He did?

1161
01:25:09,518 --> 01:25:14,467
t'll be a cinch. Virgil Smith,
by appointment to His Majesty,
Frances Joseph the First.

1162
01:25:14,544 --> 01:25:18,121
Who made that appointment?
My little honey Countess.

1163
01:25:18,188 --> 01:25:21,669
My mind isn't as quick as yours.
Let's be quite clear about this.

1164
01:25:21,736 --> 01:25:24,229
It was that phonograph
from the very beginning?

1165
01:25:24,296 --> 01:25:28,900
Oh, come now, Countess.
What's a salesman after, first,
last and all the time? A sale.

1166
01:25:28,967 --> 01:25:33,349
Of course. And everything
that happened between us, all
those words, those silly dreams,

1167
01:25:33,416 --> 01:25:36,102
that was all part
of what you call...
a sales campaign?

1168
01:25:36,169 --> 01:25:40,484
I had a hunch you'd be
a little sore, but you couldn't
have taken it seriously.

1169
01:25:40,551 --> 01:25:43,371
A Countess and a drummer,
come now.

1170
01:25:43,438 --> 01:25:46,305
No, not really.
Only for a short time, perhaps,

1171
01:25:46,382 --> 01:25:50,026
which makes me very stupid
or you a very good
salesman, indeed.

1172
01:25:50,093 --> 01:25:52,807
The company thinks so.
They send me on all
the tough assignments.

1173
01:25:52,874 --> 01:25:56,384
- It wasn't so tough, was it?
- This is what you get
for stooping so low.

1174
01:25:56,461 --> 01:25:59,040
You're right, Father.

1175
01:25:59,117 --> 01:26:03,586
The blood rushes to one's head
and one gets a little dizzy
but I'm quite all right now.

1176
01:26:03,653 --> 01:26:06,588
[Virgil]
No hard feelings?
No feelings at all.

1177
01:26:06,664 --> 01:26:10,625
It's so preposterous,
it's... it's funny.
It's nothing but funny.

1178
01:26:10,692 --> 01:26:14,921
You and that island
and that nasty little dog, and
my going to the Emperor for you.

1179
01:26:14,988 --> 01:26:19,745
t's funny
and it's asinine and humiliating
and a little disgusting,

1180
01:26:19,812 --> 01:26:24,837
but it's mostly funny.
Not so funny as me taking
a life-size countess to Newark.

1181
01:26:26,084 --> 01:26:28,453
This is yours,
I believe.
So it is.

1182
01:26:28,491 --> 01:26:30,313
Come on, Buttons.

1183
01:26:31,493 --> 01:26:35,750
Good-bye, Countess.
His respectful regards
to Scheherazade.

1184
01:26:35,818 --> 01:26:40,095
I never suspected that even
garbage could be so cheap.
Don't you know us Americans?

1185
01:26:40,171 --> 01:26:44,257
Anything for a dollar.

[Continues]

1188
01:27:22,952 --> 01:27:26,366
Everything seemed so perfect
with that dreadful man
out of her life.

1189
01:27:26,433 --> 01:27:29,789
Johanna engaged
to the Marques Lafuente.
Half a dozen castles.

1190
01:27:29,857 --> 01:27:34,114
Seven. The Lafuentes have more
of everything. Their children
were born with 11 fingers.

1191
01:27:34,182 --> 01:27:39,072
And the poor American,
what happened to him?
Poor? What's poor about him?

1192
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:43,445
He made a gigantic success
selling those machines by
the thousands, the little worm.

1193
01:27:43,522 --> 01:27:47,205
Worm indeed.
By what possible right did he
come to the Emperor's Ball?

1194
01:27:47,272 --> 01:27:50,810
Oh, why can't
he leaveJohanna alone?
What does he want from her now?

1195
01:27:50,887 --> 01:27:54,263
I wouldn't have broken
into that ballroom if it wasn't
a matter of life and death.

1196
01:27:54,339 --> 01:27:56,411
Mr. Smith,
I am not interested.

1197
01:27:56,488 --> 01:28:00,276
Countess, after this
You'll never see me again.
We're ready to go back home.

1198
01:28:00,352 --> 01:28:03,996
Only he'll never make it.
He'll never live to see America
again unless you help us.

1199
01:28:04,064 --> 01:28:07,382
No.
He's out there in a
sleigh, all bundled up.
You ought to see him.

1200
01:28:07,458 --> 01:28:10,901
Poor little rack of bones.
Hasn't slept in I don't know
how long. Won't eat.

1201
01:28:10,978 --> 01:28:14,488
Just lies there with his eyes
like a couple of candles
that are just about burned out.

1202
01:28:14,564 --> 01:28:17,346
I'm extremely sorry.
Last night he dragged
himself out of the hotel.

1203
01:28:17,413 --> 01:28:20,539
You know where I found him?
Down in front of your house.
I rang the bell.

1204
01:28:20,606 --> 01:28:24,701
One of your servants told me
Scheherazade was at the Palace.
She cannot be disturbed.

1205
01:28:24,768 --> 01:28:28,345
What are you trying to do?
You trying to take it out
on him for something I did?

1206
01:28:28,412 --> 01:28:32,824
Buttons isn't a businessman.
All Buttons did was
to lose his fool heart.

1207
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:35,355
One doesn't die
of a lost heart, Mr. Smith,

1208
01:28:35,422 --> 01:28:38,769
except in those syrupy songs
chambermaids play
on your phonograph.

1209
01:28:38,846 --> 01:28:43,708
Aw, let him see her just once.
Give them one moment together
so the dog can breathe again.

You're not gonna let him die.
Let me go out to the sleigh
and get him.

1213
01:29:07,616 --> 01:29:10,713
Release my arm, Mr. Smith.
I'm expected back
in the ballroom.

1214
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:14,166
I forgot the word, maybe.
Please.

where have you been?
What is it, Father?

01:29:24,705 --> 01:29:28,378
It's Scheherazade. Word's
just come from the stables.

She isn't here and you
wouldn't want to see her.

Not anymore.
Take my word for it.
All right, you asked for it.

1225
01:30:08,415 --> 01:30:11,638
She took the other fellow after
all, that royal stuffed shirt.

1226
01:30:11,705 --> 01:30:16,375
Seems at this very moment she's
presenting him with a family.
Now, do you give up?

Good evening, Dr. Zweiback.
Have they arrived yet?

Not quite yet,
Your Majesty.
How is the patient?

Admirable. Temperature normal,
pulse full, soft and regular.
We have no apprehensions.

I warn you, Dr. Zweiback,
I expect every care taken
in the delivery.

1233

They shall be ushered into the
world with all the solicitude
of which my hands are capable.

1234

Stop that nonsense.
Go back to your patient.

1235
01:30:59,318 --> 01:31:02,963

I feel that I should
be with her now.

Great relief
when this is all over.

1238
01:31:11,066 --> 01:31:14,068
I feel exactly as I did
when I was waiting
for the birth ofJohanna.

1239
01:31:14,135 --> 01:31:16,983
I realize this
is more important.

1240
01:31:17,050 --> 01:31:20,080
What shall we call the little
black things, Holenia?

1241
01:31:20,148 --> 01:31:23,696
I've made a list of a few
dark names. For the first born,
I should suggest Othello.

1242
01:31:23,763 --> 01:31:27,244
Good.
For the second,
perhaps Cafe Noir.

1243
01:31:27,321 --> 01:31:30,006
If he's very small,
Demi-tasse.

1244
01:31:30,073 --> 01:31:33,813
And if it's a female, Sheba.
Queen of Sheba, you know.
She was dark.

01:32:50,158 --> 01:32:52,613
There's an interesting
possibility in the Hague.

1255
01:32:52,690 --> 01:32:54,541
How so?
[Knocking At Door]

1256
01:33:11,026 --> 01:33:13,126
Yes.
The puppies
have arrived.

1257
01:33:13,203 --> 01:33:15,504
Well?
You've lost one of them?
Well? No.

1258
01:33:15,571 --> 01:33:17,902
Are they deformed?
Have they got two heads?
No.

1259
01:33:17,969 --> 01:33:21,546
What is it?
Brace yourself,
Baron Holenia.

1260
01:33:23,061 --> 01:33:25,995
[Whimpering Continues]

1261
01:33:26,063 --> 01:33:28,585
[Holenia]
No.
[Dr. Zweiback]
Yes.

1262
01:33:30,637 --> 01:33:34,761
That blasted blackJezebel.
Father, please, don't.
Not now.

1263
01:33:34,828 --> 01:33:39,239
Isn't there one of them
that hasn't got so much white?
That's all there is, Baron.

1264
01:33:39,316 --> 01:33:43,017
Cursed. Cursed.
She can't do this to me.

1265
01:33:43,085 --> 01:33:45,808
She seems
to have done it, Father.

1266
01:33:47,438 --> 01:33:51,974
Your Majesty would like to know
if there are any developments.
There are.

1267
01:34:00,874 --> 01:34:04,623
What is it, Holenia?
I was told to come here because
it would happen at any minute.

1268
01:34:04,691 --> 01:34:07,078
When will it happen?
It has happened,
Your Majesty.

1269
01:34:07,146 --> 01:34:09,735
It has? How many?
Three, Your Majesty.

1270
01:34:09,802 --> 01:34:14,443
Three? Is that all?
It's not many but I dare say
it will have to do.

1271
01:34:14,511 --> 01:34:16,927
Where are my glasses?
I want to see them at once.

1272
01:34:17,004 --> 01:34:21,032
I don't think
Your Majesty should.
Why?
Why shouldn't I see them?

1273
01:34:21,099 --> 01:34:25,127
Your Majesty, great grief
has befallen us. The puppies...

1274
01:34:25,194 --> 01:34:28,013
Come, come, come.
It was beyond my control,
Your Majesty.

1275
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:30,948
The puppies
were born dead.

1276
01:34:31,024 --> 01:34:34,918
Dead?
[Dr. Zweiback] One of those
rare, unpredictable occurrences.

1277
01:34:34,985 --> 01:34:38,917
The expected mother
must've had a fall.
Dead? All three of them?

1278
01:34:38,984 --> 01:34:42,820
[Holenia]
Yes, Your Majesty.
Dead is such an ugly word.

1279
01:34:42,897 --> 01:34:47,202
We're bitterly sorry for
Your Majesty's disappointment.
How is Scheherazade?

1280
01:34:47,279 --> 01:34:49,734
She's recovering nicely,
thank you, Your Majesty.

1281
01:34:49,801 --> 01:34:52,295
Poor Louis.
It will be quite a blow.

1282
01:34:52,362 --> 01:34:56,255
In this our moment
of sorrow, may I venture
to offer some consolation?

1283
01:34:56,332 --> 01:35:00,484
There will be other days.
She'll give us some puppies yet.
That's the way to look at it.

1284
01:35:00,552 --> 01:35:03,208
Come spring
and we can count
on another litter.

1285
01:35:03,275 --> 01:35:05,644
The question is,
can I count on another spring?

1286
01:35:05,711 --> 01:35:08,262
If I may be permitted, Your
Majesty, it's almost 11:00.
What of it?

1287
01:35:08,329 --> 01:35:11,426
The ball, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty is to appear
at 11:00.

1288
01:35:11,494 --> 01:35:14,466
His Majesty is
in no mood for a ball.
You're quite right.

1289
01:35:14,534 --> 01:35:19,559
I'm in the mood for a cemetery.
Let us proceed to the ball.

1290
01:35:24,910 --> 01:35:27,461
[Dr. Zweiback Whispering]
Baron Holenia.

1291
01:35:27,528 --> 01:35:31,306
The puppies.
What about the puppies?
Didn't you hear? They're dead.

1292
01:35:31,373 --> 01:35:34,183
They are?
They must be.
Dead, buried, forgotten.

1293
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:37,511
See to it at once.
That's an order.

1294
01:35:40,234 --> 01:35:43,974
All right, Andreas.
You heard the orders.

1295
01:35:44,358 --> 01:35:47,657
[Puppies Whimpering]

1296
01:35:49,795 --> 01:35:52,356

[Squealing Continues]

1299
01:36:39,557 --> 01:36:40,574
[Virgil]
Hi.!

1300
01:36:42,089 --> 01:36:45,858
May I come in or is it past
visiting hours?
Who are you? Get out of here!

1301
01:36:45,925 --> 01:36:49,953
Oh, aren't you being a little
rude? This little gentlemen
is a very close relative.

1302
01:36:50,020 --> 01:36:52,705
Nobody's allowed in here.
Oh, well, he is.
Say hello to them.

1303
01:36:52,772 --> 01:36:55,707
Keep away from her.
Here, look out.
What are you doing?

1304
01:36:55,783 --> 01:36:58,747
[Puppies Squealing,
Water Running]
Where are the pups?

1305
01:36:58,823 --> 01:37:03,455
Throw him out!
Wait a minute. Where are those
pups? What goes on here?

1306
01:37:03,522 --> 01:37:06,275
Orders have been given.
What orders?
What are you gonna do?

1307
01:37:06,342 --> 01:37:09,190
Get out of here!
Aaah.

1308
01:37:09,248 --> 01:37:11,261
[Dr. Zweiback]
Hold him.!

1309
01:37:22,021 --> 01:37:26,011
I flatter myself I handled
the puppy situation rather well.

1310
01:37:26,087 --> 01:37:29,310
Do you think it's ever wise
to lie to His Majesty?
The puppies are dead.

1311
01:37:29,377 --> 01:37:32,445
I gave orders.
Sssh.
Father!

'm not gonna let you.!

1318

don't care how many of you
there are. T's probably a good
thing there are so many of you.

Maybe all of you can scrape up
decency to lay off three duffers
who'vejust begun to breathe!

There not pure enough
for you, huh?

You wouldn't have around!

1322

You're gonna shake 'em off that
great, big noble family tree...

1323

and let them rot
as if nothing had happened!

and you know it!

It seemed wiser. I didn't want
to shock Your Majesty.

1327

Bring them here,
Mr. Smith.

1328
01:39:08,795 --> 01:39:13,753
And as my hearing
is not impaired, please
do not shout at me.

1329
01:39:13,820 --> 01:39:17,052
Well, I wanted
to get my two cents worth in
before you started talking.

1330
01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:20,120
Last time, like a chump,
I kept my mouth shut
and what did you do?

1331
01:39:20,188 --> 01:39:24,445
You sold me about the wrong side
of the tracks and me not being
good enough. You remember?

1332
01:39:24,513 --> 01:39:28,981
Are we discussing the Countess
von Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg
or the contents of that basket?

1333
01:39:29,049 --> 01:39:31,926
Well, it amounts
to the same thing.
Only now I know,

1334
01:39:31,993 --> 01:39:35,445
with your very kind permission,
that you were full
of cracked ice!

1335
01:39:35,512 --> 01:39:39,032
Or maybe I was
to fall for it and walk out
and make a heel out of myself!

1336
01:39:39,099 --> 01:39:41,813
Virgil, will you say that
again, please, slowly
and plainly and simply?

1337
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:44,306
Not now, honey Countess.

Your Majesty, was it me
that you made him give up?
Yes, Johanna, yes.

1340
01:39:49,849 --> 01:39:53,359
We both agreed that with him,
You had only one chance
in a million to be happy.

1341
01:39:53,436 --> 01:39:58,355
Your Majesty thinks that I am
happy? Isn't one chance in a
million better than no chance?

1342
01:39:58,422 --> 01:40:02,767
My dear, you're much
too pretty for mathematics.
They're all boys.

1343
01:40:02,843 --> 01:40:05,078
That's right.
Boys run in Buttons' family.

1344
01:40:05,145 --> 01:40:08,971
This tiny one has a bite
like a nutcracker.
They're sweet, Your Majesty.

1345
01:40:09,048 --> 01:40:11,570
They'll be the strongest,
the smartest, the funniest...

1346
01:40:11,637 --> 01:40:15,185
And between Buttons and me,
we'll bring 'em up right
when we get 'em back home.

1347
01:40:15,253 --> 01:40:17,458
- Can I have 'em back now, sir?
- You cannot.

1348
01:40:17,525 --> 01:40:20,565
Why should you have Buttons,
Johanna, Scheherazade
and the puppies?

1349
01:40:20,633 --> 01:40:24,622
Maybe we could leave one.
The one who's so attached
to His Majesty's finger.

1350
01:40:24,699 --> 01:40:28,592
Sounds like a good deal.
I'd even be willing to
withdraw the cracked ice crack.

1351
01:40:28,669 --> 01:40:33,138
I'm keeping them all.
Now leave me alone.
Go on, dance, all of you.

1352
01:40:34,423 --> 01:40:36,945
[Orchestra]
Your Majesty, if I may...

1353
01:40:37,012 --> 01:40:40,790
You may not, Holenia.
I will talk to you later.

1354
01:40:46,746 --> 01:40:50,419
Putzi, how do I
look to you now?

1355
01:40:50,486 --> 01:40:54,485
I think the word
is ravishing.
Shall we dance?

1356
01:41:05,906 --> 01:41:09,426
[Virgil]
Love is a dream

1357
01:41:09,493 --> 01:41:12,341
Yet it's so real

1358
01:41:12,408 --> 01:41:15,218
Hard to explain

1359
01:41:15,285 --> 01:41:18,479
Just how you feel

Deep in your heart

1361
01:41:21,528 --> 01:41:24,242
Joy seems to dwell

1362
01:41:24,309 --> 01:41:28,433
Like poets say

1363
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:31,885
It's perfectly swell
