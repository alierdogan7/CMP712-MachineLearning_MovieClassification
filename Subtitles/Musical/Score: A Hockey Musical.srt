You talking to me,

206
00:09:46,084 --> 00:09:48,252
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>What's your name?</i>

207
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:49,654
Farley Gordon.

208
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,405
It doesn't ring a bell.

209
00:09:51,506 --> 00:09:52,674
How old are you?

210
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:54,007
Seventeen.

Who owns your rights?

212
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,380
Sir, there's a little kid
attached to your leg.

213
00:09:59,481 --> 00:10:02,300
And I don't have any idea
what you're talking about.

214
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,068
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>it's my grandson.</i>

215
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,089
There's hope we can
domesticate him one day.

216
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,557
So who do you play for?

217
00:10:09,658 --> 00:10:11,459
Nobody.
Never have.

218
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,361
What?
Why not?

219
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,897
My parents don't believe
in team competitions.

220
00:10:16,998 --> 00:10:19,032
What are they,
communists?

221
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:21,619
<i>Ah, not in the</i>
<i>classic sense, though.</i>

222
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,688
They're kind of more
like pacifist-anarchists,

223
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:27,324
although I'm sure they'd deny
even that categorization.

224
00:10:27,425 --> 00:10:28,842
You mean to tell me
you've never played

225
00:10:28,944 --> 00:10:30,844
an organized game of
hockey in your life?

226
00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:32,146
<i>That's right.</i>

227
00:10:32,247 --> 00:10:34,298
Just whatever games I can
pick up here on the rink.

228
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,550
<chuckles>

229
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:39,720
Well, son, my name
is Walt Acorn.

230
00:10:39,821 --> 00:10:42,923
I'm the owner of
the Brampton Blades.

231

00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:52,466
I'm not sure I understand.

235
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:54,535
<i>If you could do half of</i>
<i>what I saw you do today</i>

236
00:10:54,636 --> 00:10:56,237
in an organized game,

237
00:10:56,338 --> 00:10:58,740
you could be
the next Sidney Crosby.

238
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:02,360
Cindy who?

239
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:06,580
<i>We don't speak athlete</i>

Farley up for hockey.

242
00:11:11,186 --> 00:11:13,587

pottery classes

243
00:11:13,688 --> 00:11:16,490
<i>and his volunteering</i>
<i>at the museum</i>

244
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:18,025

Throw in the all-things

247
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:24,615
to that equation and--

248
00:11:24,716 --> 00:11:27,084
It's obvious
there's no time for

249
00:11:27,185 --> 00:11:30,454
organized team
hockey in his schedule.

250
00:11:30,555 --> 00:11:31,756
Wow!

251
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,525
This conversation
just laid a giant turd

252
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:37,795
in the shallow end
of the stupid pool.

253
00:11:40,465 --> 00:11:43,818
<i>So... I take it</i>
<i>we're done here.</i>

254
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:46,420
Thankfully,
<i>yes.</i>

255
00:11:46,522 --> 00:11:47,988
Unless, of course,
you'd like to hear

256
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:50,590
another of
my folk songs.

258
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:57,598
¶ So hug away. ¶

¶ Hugs, hugs, hugs. ¶

<i>Son,</i>

263
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,629
I've been around hockey
over sixty years.

264
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,697
This is the first time I've
ever had to tell someone

265
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:17,235
they're making a
huge mistake...

266
00:12:17,335 --> 00:12:20,872
You're making
a huge mistake.

267
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:23,540

271
00:13:05,716 --> 00:13:07,217

Farley?

272
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:08,718
You've been on
Planet Glum all morning.

273
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,022
Okay.

274
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,591
I want to give
organized hockey a try.

275
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:17,862
Team sports?

276
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:18,863
Really?

277
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,264
Maybe my id is
out on a day pass

278
00:13:20,365 --> 00:13:22,266
but it's all
I can think about.

279
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:23,701
And let me guess.

280
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:26,303
Your parents think the idea
is more inherently evil

281
00:13:26,404 --> 00:13:27,872
than
genetically-modified food

282
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,439
and organized
religion.

283
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,474
Yeah.

284
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:34,312
¶

285
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:37,415
¶ Farley Gordon, you should
always follow your heart. ¶

286
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:41,052
¶ But everyone knows
that hockey's not art. ¶

287
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,619
¶ I've never been to camp ¶

288
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,722
¶ or even played on a team. ¶

289
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:47,491
¶ I've never been
away from my parents. ¶

290
00:13:47,592 --> 00:13:51,178
¶ And you're
seventeen. ¶

291
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,782
¶ I'm seventeen. ¶

¶

294
00:14:03,391 --> 00:14:06,860
¶ Eventually we all have to
cut the umbilical cord. ¶

295
00:14:06,962 --> 00:14:10,497
¶ What if I don't fit in?
What if I get bored? ¶

296
00:14:10,598 --> 00:14:14,218
¶ Embrace the Zen mindset for
this part of your journey. ¶

297
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:18,689
¶ Quit if you find
group sports unworthy. ¶

298
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:24,962
¶

299
00:14:25,063 --> 00:14:27,064
¶ So you think that
I should join. ¶

300
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:28,999
¶ Should I give it a shot? ¶

301
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,667
¶ What have you
got to lose? ¶

302
00:14:30,768 --> 00:14:32,702
¶ So why?
So why not? ¶

303
00:14:32,803 --> 00:14:36,306
¶ So I'll join the team
and I'll give it a shot. ¶

304
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:40,010
¶ So you'll join the team.
So you'll give it a shot. ¶

305
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:41,878
¶ Yeah,
I'm seventeen. ¶

306
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:43,714
¶ I might like it a lot. ¶

307
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:45,349
¶ Yeah,
you're seventeen. ¶

308
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,451
¶ You'll probably
like it a lot. ¶

309
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:49,753
¶ And by doing so we can ¶

310
00:14:49,854 --> 00:14:52,323
¶ advance the plot. ¶

311
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:56,610
¶ Plot, plot, plot. ¶

312
00:14:56,711 --> 00:14:58,211
Call this a
mother's intuition,

313
00:14:58,312 --> 00:15:00,114
but this has
Neanderthal and

314
00:15:00,214 --> 00:15:02,382
ne'er-do-well
written all over it.

315
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:05,152
I promise I won't do anything
to not make you proud.

316
00:15:05,253 --> 00:15:06,653
<i>Interesting.</i>

317
00:15:06,754 --> 00:15:07,855
Double negative.

318
00:15:07,956 --> 00:15:10,057
Like hockey
and violence.

319
00:15:10,158 --> 00:15:11,992
Please.
I'm going to Brampton,

320
00:15:12,093 --> 00:15:13,460
not Bosnia,
okay?

321
00:15:13,562 --> 00:15:15,829
I'll be back by dinner.

322
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:16,897
Goodbye,

323
00:15:16,998 --> 00:15:18,398
Goodbye.

324
00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:21,018
Love you.

325
00:15:21,152 --> 00:15:22,669

Well, actually, I'm here

Excuse me?

"Whom."
It's actually "whom."

It's the object of
the preposition.

350
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,346
I don't care if it's the

00:16:36,978 --> 00:16:39,112
Stopped a slap shot
with his tonsils.

358
00:16:39,213 --> 00:16:42,399
Broke his jaw
in four places.

359
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,735
<i>Do yourself</i>
<i>a favour, son.</i>

360
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:46,103
It's not too late.

361
00:16:46,204 --> 00:16:48,605
Bust that sequined
unitard out of the closet,

362
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:49,973
sharpen up
those toe picks

363
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,192
and rejoin the
figure skating squad.

364
00:16:52,293 --> 00:16:53,210
Trust me.

365
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:55,379
They'll welcome you
back with open arms.

366
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,515
I'm here to play hockey.

367
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:00,734
Oh yeah?

368
00:17:03,154 --> 00:17:06,190
<i>We'll see</i>
<i>about that, peacock.</i>

369
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,458
Don't say I
didn't warn you.

370
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,248
This should fit.

371
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:26,109
Is that right?

372
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,512
Not unless
you're a dick face.

373
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:31,965
<i>Not like ladies,</i>
<i>like men!</i>

374
00:17:32,066 --> 00:17:34,552
<i>Go after it, guys,</i>
<i>go after it!</i>

375
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,321
<whistle>

376
00:17:40,358 --> 00:17:41,658
Up against the boards.

377
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:45,078
Something wrong with
<i>your balls, son?</i>

378
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,614
No,
just the...

379
00:17:46,714 --> 00:17:49,900
equipment's a little
uncomfortable.

380
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:53,186
Don't worry, you won't
be wearing it that long.

381
00:17:53,287 --> 00:17:56,290
<i>You!</i>
<i>Give us Bailey and Apps!</i>

382
00:17:58,226 --> 00:17:59,727
Let's see you,
peacock.

383
00:18:00,028 --> 00:18:17,110
¶

384
00:18:17,212 --> 00:18:19,779
That's cute,
twinkle toes.

385
00:18:19,881 --> 00:18:21,414
<i>Want to go again?</i>

386
00:18:21,515 --> 00:18:23,216
Yeah.

387
00:18:23,317 --> 00:18:25,602
<i>Ferguson,</i>
<i>McNamee!</i>

388
00:18:25,703 --> 00:18:28,422
<i><team yelling></i>

389
00:18:28,523 --> 00:18:29,706
<i>Let's see you,</i>
<i>kid.</i>

390
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:38,515
¶

391
00:18:38,616 --> 00:18:40,317
<i>The Moose.</i>

392
00:18:40,418 --> 00:18:55,181
¶

393
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:56,767
Ugh!

394
00:18:56,868 --> 00:18:57,751
Boom.
Boom. Boom.

395
00:18:57,852 --> 00:18:59,786
Out go the lights.

396
00:19:05,976 --> 00:19:10,080
<moaning>

397
00:19:10,181 --> 00:19:11,915
Aristotle?

398
00:19:12,016 --> 00:19:14,584
That's a first.

399
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,987
What happened?

400
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:19,690
Well, you ran into a brick
<i>wall named The Moose.</i>

401
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,674
I bet they heard
the hit in Mumbai.

402
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:27,013
Hey!
Hey, boss!

403
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,584
We in the
hardware business?

404
00:19:30,685 --> 00:19:32,218
Sure feels like
I'm getting screwed.

405
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,720
You can't be serious about
letting that kid play.

406
00:19:33,822 --> 00:19:35,989
You saw what he did with the
puck 'til he got flattened.

407
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,724
That won't
happen again.

408
00:19:37,826 --> 00:19:39,493
One game,
regular shifts.

409
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:41,161
If he's not as good
as I think he is,

410
00:19:41,262 --> 00:19:42,395
do what you want.

411
00:19:42,497 --> 00:19:43,831
Come on, Walt. He's going
to get killed out there.

412
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:48,469
Last time I checked,
I still own the team.

413
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:49,903
Pfft...

414
00:19:52,006 --> 00:19:54,708
Farley Gordon.

415
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,761
Ah,
there you are.

416
00:19:59,297 --> 00:20:00,730
Great meeting you,
<i>sprout.</i>

417
00:20:00,831 --> 00:20:01,965
Now, if you want
any information

418
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,633
on joining
our booster club,

419
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:05,336
you'll find it on
our web site. Here.

420
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:06,970
Here's a T-shirt.
Thanks for coming out.

421
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:12,276
So that's it,
I'm off the team?

422
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:18,198
Well,
not technically.

423
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:20,133
But I figured
getting knocked out,

424
00:20:20,234 --> 00:20:21,268
that would be enough to
convince you

425
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:23,203
that these are very,

426
00:20:23,304 --> 00:20:25,439
very dangerous waters

427
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,674
<i>that you're</i>
<i>lily-dipping in.</i>

428
00:20:29,794 --> 00:20:31,595
<i>Sir,</i>

429
00:20:31,696 --> 00:20:33,697
<i>do you ever have</i>
<i>those epiphany moments</i>

430
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:34,998
where all of a sudden
the world starts making

431
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,302
a lot more sense?

432
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,936
Occasionally,
a good bowel movement

433
00:20:40,037 --> 00:20:42,306
will have that effect.

434
00:20:42,357 --> 00:20:43,890
Yeah.

435
00:20:43,991 --> 00:20:46,059
Well..

436
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,995
this might sound
stupid, but...

437
00:20:49,096 --> 00:20:50,697
before Walt Acorn
walked into my life

438
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:53,033
there was a hole,
a longing that

439
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:54,601
I couldn't articulate
or, rather,

440
00:20:54,702 --> 00:20:56,002
I didn't even know existed.

441
00:20:56,103 --> 00:20:58,104
But I honestly believe
that organized hockey

442
00:20:58,206 --> 00:21:00,624
might just fill that hole.

443
00:21:00,725 --> 00:21:02,459
¶ What do you weigh,
kid? ¶

444
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,895
¶ A buck fifty-five? ¶

445
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:07,981
¶ I'm not that vain.
I'm not into my size. ¶

446
00:21:08,082 --> 00:21:09,666
¶ There are other
games that are more ¶

447
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:11,534
¶ appropriate
for you to play - ¶

448
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:14,938
¶ Like checkers,
like chess, and croquet. ¶

449
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,740
¶ Well, I've always
been taught ¶

450
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:18,442
¶ to see things through. ¶

451
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:24,064
¶ To my heart...
always be true ¶

452
00:21:24,165 --> 00:21:25,382
¶

453
00:21:25,483 --> 00:21:28,251
¶ Hallmark, I'm sure,
would be so proud ¶

454
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:31,288
¶ to hear you voice those
sentiments out loud. ¶

455
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:34,124
¶ But a well-played fart
would knock you down. ¶

456
00:21:34,225 --> 00:21:35,558
¶ If The Moose meant harm, ¶

457
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:37,527
¶ you'd be in
a hospital gown. ¶

458
00:21:37,628 --> 00:21:40,581
¶ This is the toughest
league in the land. ¶

459
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:43,733
¶ You'll never survive
so become a fan. ¶

460
00:21:43,785 --> 00:21:46,319
¶ Just because I still
have my front teeth, ¶

461
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,256
¶ don't assume
that I can't compete. ¶

462
00:21:49,357 --> 00:21:52,425
¶ Though I might not come
with a hockey pedigree - ¶

463
00:21:52,526 --> 00:21:54,128
¶ Why can't I still
dream of being ¶

464
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,863
¶ the next Crosby? ¶

465
00:21:55,964 --> 00:21:57,013
¶ You never played the game. ¶

466
00:21:57,114 --> 00:21:58,515
¶ No one even knows your name. ¶

467
00:21:58,616 --> 00:22:01,618
¶ Hockey legends
don't happen overnight. ¶

468
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:02,986
¶ It takes a bunch of years ¶

469
00:22:03,087 --> 00:22:04,488
¶ and a bucketful of tears. ¶

470
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:06,957
¶ And to put you in
the game is suicide. ¶

471
00:22:08,158 --> 00:22:09,292
I can't kick
you off the team

472
00:22:09,393 --> 00:22:10,627
and I won't protect you.

473
00:22:10,728 --> 00:22:11,928
And when you're
lying in a coma,

474
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:14,498
don't say
I didn't warn you.

475
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:15,866
Technically,
if I'm in a coma

476
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,501
I wouldn't
be able to speak.

477
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:24,508
One game.

478
00:22:31,265 --> 00:22:33,700
Doesn't Mr. Acorn's opinion
count for anything?

479
00:22:33,801 --> 00:22:35,168
I mean, obviously,
he saw something in me

480
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:37,204
that he thought
worth giving a shot.

481
00:22:37,305 --> 00:22:40,474
He's legally blind
without his glasses.

482
00:22:40,575 --> 00:22:41,975
Yeah.                    No way.

483
00:22:42,076 --> 00:22:45,245
My guess he wasn't wearing
them when he discovered you.

484
00:22:45,346 --> 00:22:48,215
You didn't notice anything
strange about his behaviour?

485
00:22:48,316 --> 00:22:51,618
<barking>

486
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:54,053
How long have
you owned a dog?

487
00:22:54,154 --> 00:22:57,924
¶

488
00:22:59,927 --> 00:23:01,762
Tomorrow's game
<i>starts at two.</i>

489
00:23:01,862 --> 00:23:03,630
Don't be late,
tough guy.

490
00:23:07,134 --> 00:23:10,637
<i>I don't have to tell you</i>
<i>guys what this game means.</i>

491
00:23:13,107 --> 00:23:14,874
The Devils...

492
00:23:14,975 --> 00:23:16,810
dirty cheap-shot artists
who wouldn't hesitate

493
00:23:16,911 --> 00:23:18,578
to rip out their
mother's heart,

494
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,597
sell it on eBay
for a minimum bid

495
00:23:20,698 --> 00:23:23,466
if it meant two points.

496
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,670
Which is...

497
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:27,871
<i><mouse squeaking></i>

498
00:23:28,022 --> 00:23:29,572
<i>..precisely why</i>
<i>they're in first place!</i>

499
00:23:29,673 --> 00:23:30,490
<i>Where's your passion?</i>

500
00:23:30,591 --> 00:23:31,792
A mouse!

501
00:23:31,893 --> 00:23:35,144
<team yelling>

502
00:23:35,245 --> 00:23:37,747
You mean this?
The common mus musculus.

503
00:23:37,848 --> 00:23:39,966
Get it out of here.

504
00:23:40,067 --> 00:23:42,152
<i>Game time!</i>

505
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,120
<i>Let's go, guys.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

506
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:45,755
<i>Let's go.</i>

507
00:23:45,856 --> 00:23:47,624
<i>Go! Go! Go! Go!</i>

508
00:23:57,902 --> 00:23:59,035
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

509
00:23:59,136 --> 00:24:00,737
Who pooed
on your shirt?

510
00:24:01,005 --> 00:24:02,723
<grunts>

511
00:24:02,824 --> 00:24:04,374
<crowd cheering>

512
00:24:04,475 --> 00:24:06,109
Yeah!

513
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:10,514
¶

514
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,581
Yes!
Yes!

515
00:24:11,682 --> 00:24:13,550
Mess him up!

516
00:24:13,651 --> 00:24:15,685
<i>Hit 'em high.</i>
<i>Hit 'em low.</i>

517
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:18,355
Make him sing soprano!

518
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:33,103
¶

519
00:24:33,204 --> 00:24:35,539
<shouting>

520
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,141
It's like Dante's
Inferno down there.

521
00:24:38,242 --> 00:24:43,981
¶

522
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:45,548
You missed
the introductions.

523
00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:47,367
¶

524
00:24:47,468 --> 00:24:50,136
What could have
caused all this?

525
00:24:50,237 --> 00:24:51,688
¶ Hockey without fighting ¶

526
00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:54,090
¶ is like Kraft Dinner
without cheese. ¶

527
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,026
¶ It's still pasta... ¶

528
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:58,678
¶ but the palate,
it won't please. ¶

529
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,614
¶ Violence in sport? ¶

530
00:25:00,715 --> 00:25:02,982
¶ Isn't this supposed
to be fun? ¶

531
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:04,818
¶ The boys are
letting off steam. ¶

532
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:07,670
¶ They're not
hurting anyone. ¶

533
00:25:07,771 --> 00:25:09,739
¶ La-dee-da-dee

need to speak to you.

What was that all about?

611
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:32,758
Because you're on the team,
Bailey's off.

612
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,961
True, his on-ice
skills might have been

613
00:28:35,062 --> 00:28:36,729
better served to
driving a Zamboni,

614
00:28:36,831 --> 00:28:40,033
but he was like
a son to Coach Donker.

615
00:28:41,568 --> 00:28:43,570
<i>Especially after Bailey</i>
<i>lost both his parents</i>

616
00:28:43,671 --> 00:28:46,055
to a grizzly attack.

00:28:46,156 --> 00:28:48,607

So that's why the
coach hates me.

620
00:28:55,382 --> 00:28:56,867
So what will Bailey do now?

621
00:28:58,669 --> 00:29:00,070
He'll probably
start pouring beer

622
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:02,272

cereals.

00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:04,074

629
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,734
And then twenty years
later he will be

630
00:29:14,835 --> 00:29:17,270
unceremoniously laid off
from his miserable job.

631
00:29:18,538 --> 00:29:20,506
The stress of this will lead
to a fatal heart attack

within a week.

633
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,526
But at least death
will free him from

634
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:26,095
the bitterness he's
felt every damn minute

635
00:29:26,196 --> 00:29:27,830

Brampton Blades jersey

636
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:31,200

00:33:17,728 --> 00:33:19,362
I might have slept
through practice.

712
00:33:19,463 --> 00:33:22,131
But Wednesdays we volunteer
at the soup kitchen.

713
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:23,399
You're not coming?

714
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,067
Right.

715
00:33:25,168 --> 00:33:26,903
I forgot.

716
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:29,506
I'm sure Coach won't mind
if I miss a practice.

717
00:33:31,425 --> 00:33:34,293
Does anyone know

718
00:33:34,394 --> 00:33:36,996
where our precious

719
00:33:37,097 --> 00:33:40,483
Farley Gordon might be?

720
00:33:40,584 --> 00:33:43,886
Kid scores nine goals in
<i>his first three games.</i>

721
00:33:43,987 --> 00:33:46,522
Maybe he doesn't
need to practice.

722
00:33:46,623 --> 00:33:49,625
You got a show pony
on your hands, Coach.

723
00:33:49,726 --> 00:33:52,562
Clearly he trots to the
beat of a different drummer.

They clearly wanted to win

seems kind of unfair

00:50:27,106 --> 00:50:31,109
¶ And forever. ¶

1068
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:34,179
¶

1069
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,081
¶ By refusing to fight, ¶

1070
00:50:36,182 --> 00:50:38,250
¶ we can no longer guarantee ¶

1071
00:50:38,351 --> 00:50:39,868
¶ that around the ice ¶

1072
00:50:39,969 --> 00:50:42,654
¶ you can skate
with impunity. ¶

1073
00:50:42,755 --> 00:50:44,422
¶ No one's
expecting you to ¶

1074
00:50:44,524 --> 00:50:46,625
¶ punch out
someone's lights. ¶

1075
00:50:46,726 --> 00:50:48,393
¶ Just take a
few swings

1076
00:50:48,494 --> 00:50:50,963
¶ and it'll be all right. ¶

1077
00:50:51,063 --> 00:50:52,847
¶ But until you do, ¶

1078
00:50:52,948 --> 00:50:55,250
¶ there's a line
in the sand. ¶

1079
00:50:55,351 --> 00:50:56,868
¶ You might be
on the team, ¶

1080
00:50:56,969 --> 00:50:59,404
¶ but you aren't a
part of this band... ¶

1081
00:50:59,505 --> 00:51:01,690
¶ Of brothers!

1082
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:03,992
Oh,
brothers!

1083
00:51:04,093 --> 00:51:08,797
¶ United we'll be
'til eternity ¶

1084
00:51:08,881 --> 00:51:12,417
¶ Brothers!
Oh, brothers! ¶

1085
00:51:12,519 --> 00:51:14,553
¶ Telling war stories 'til ¶

1086
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:18,890
¶ we're a hundred and three. ¶

1087
00:51:18,991 --> 00:51:28,599
¶

1088
00:51:34,773 --> 00:51:37,042
Look, I don't like the fighting
<i>any more than you do...</i>

1089
00:51:37,143 --> 00:51:39,394
...but that's not
why I play the game.

1090
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:41,730
Farley, that's
like saying

1091
00:51:41,831 --> 00:51:43,682
the KKK are a
swell bunch of guys

1092
00:51:43,783 --> 00:51:46,785
except for their views
on African-Americans.

1093
00:51:47,053 --> 00:51:49,321
I think you're
overreacting.

1094
00:51:49,422 --> 00:51:51,256
Besides, aren't you
proud of how Farley

1095
00:51:51,357 --> 00:51:52,924
stood up for himself?

1096
00:51:54,877 --> 00:51:56,778
our father and I have
discussed the matter

1097
00:51:56,879 --> 00:51:59,547
and we feel it's in
everybody's best interests

1098
00:51:59,648 --> 00:52:01,783
if you quit
<i>the team.</i>

1099
00:52:01,884 --> 00:52:03,185
Did you ever think that
I might like to be

1100
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:04,652
an active participant

1101
00:52:04,753 --> 00:52:06,488
in your little
tête-à-tête?

1102
00:52:06,589 --> 00:52:09,391
Sarcasm,
it's so teenager-ly.

1103
00:52:09,492 --> 00:52:11,593
Farley,
it's cheap.

1104
00:52:11,694 --> 00:52:12,578
Yeah.

1105
00:52:12,679 --> 00:52:15,013
Well,
so is talk.

1106
00:52:17,867 --> 00:52:25,924
¶

1107
00:52:26,025 --> 00:52:30,361
¶ Is it me or my
parents who is right? ¶

1108
00:52:30,463 --> 00:52:33,598
¶ One of us is clearly
not seeing the light. ¶

1109
00:52:33,699 --> 00:52:37,035
¶ I thought I had it all,
all figured out. ¶

1110
00:52:37,136 --> 00:52:41,005
¶ Now everything
seems so in doubt. ¶

1111
00:52:41,106 --> 00:52:44,776
¶

1112
00:52:44,877 --> 00:52:45,811
¶ Farley Gordon, ¶

1113
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:48,012
¶ you should always
follow your heart. ¶

1114
00:52:48,113 --> 00:52:51,766
¶

1115
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:54,636
¶ Yeah, I once
took that advice, ¶

1116
00:52:54,737 --> 00:52:57,205
¶ now everything's
falling apart. ¶

1117
00:52:57,306 --> 00:53:11,586
¶

1118
00:53:11,687 --> 00:53:12,870
Play that tape again.

1119
00:53:13,139 --> 00:53:15,139
I don't care if you're one
of the greatest players

1120
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,241
to ever lace up
a pair of skates --

1121
00:53:17,343 --> 00:53:18,910
defend your honour.

1122
00:53:19,011 --> 00:53:21,646
Farley Gordon has come out
and said that he's a pacifist?

1123
00:53:21,747 --> 00:53:22,880
Ha!

1124
00:53:22,981 --> 00:53:24,982
I think that there's
another 'P' word

1125
00:53:25,083 --> 00:53:27,084
that is more appropriate.

1126
00:53:27,186 --> 00:53:28,920
We'll be back.

1127
00:53:29,021 --> 00:53:31,072
<i>See, in Canada, we tend to</i>
<i>like our hockey players</i>

1128
00:53:31,173 --> 00:53:34,075
served with a
good helping of macho.

1129
00:53:34,176 --> 00:53:35,710
And ever since
your non-fight,

1130
00:53:35,811 --> 00:53:37,796
your testosterone-
to-estrogen ratio,

1131
00:53:37,897 --> 00:53:40,065
<i>it's been</i>
<i>put into question.</i>

1132
00:53:40,166 --> 00:53:41,733
<i>Trust me.</i>

1133
00:53:41,834 --> 00:53:43,751
The offers are going
to start coming in

1134
00:53:43,852 --> 00:53:45,620
once you kick the
ass in masculine.

1135
00:53:45,721 --> 00:53:47,271
¶

1136
00:53:47,373 --> 00:53:49,891
<laughter>

1137
00:53:49,992 --> 00:53:51,259
¶

1138
00:53:51,377 --> 00:53:52,194
<grunt>

1139
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:53,912
<crowd>
Oh!

1140
00:53:54,013 --> 00:54:05,173
¶

1141
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:07,508
<whistle>

1142
00:54:07,609 --> 00:54:10,729
<crowd booing>

1143
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,263
<i>If they won't</i>
<i>respect your ideals,</i>

1144
00:54:12,365 --> 00:54:14,399
<i>how can you call</i>
<i>them team mates?</i>

1145
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,535
Maybe you should reconsider
your friendship.

1146
00:54:16,636 --> 00:54:18,069
Honestly,
they're just a little

1147
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:19,938
misguided
about fighting.

1148
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:22,674
I think eventually
they'll come around.

1149
00:54:25,361 --> 00:54:26,428
Eve, there's
something I've wanted

1150
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:28,430
to talk to you
about for awhile now.

1151
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:33,535
Of course,
Farley.

1152
00:54:37,189 --> 00:54:39,157
I don't know
where to start.

1153
00:54:42,278 --> 00:54:45,080
Please don't take this
the wrong way, okay?

1154
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,567
Oh, God,
this is embarrassing

1155
00:54:48,668 --> 00:54:50,235
<i>but I'm going</i>
<i>to say it anyway.</i>

1156
00:54:53,005 --> 00:54:56,608
Being a Blade
has made me realize

1157
00:54:56,709 --> 00:54:57,842
just how isolated
I've been.

1158
00:54:57,944 --> 00:55:00,245
Like, maybe my parents
are just not as cool

1159
00:55:00,346 --> 00:55:01,729
as I once thought
<i>they were.</i>

1160
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,034
Farley,
they were vegans,

1161
00:55:06,135 --> 00:55:07,769
environmentalists
and Yo-Yo Ma fans

1162
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:09,687
before it
was fashionable.

1163
00:55:09,788 --> 00:55:11,656
And now you're
defending my parents?

1164
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,543
Whose side are you on anyway?

1165
00:55:15,644 --> 00:55:16,944
They reject anything
that even has

1166
00:55:17,046 --> 00:55:17,945
a whiff of mainstream

1167
00:55:18,047 --> 00:55:19,147
before they
give it a chance.

1168
00:55:19,248 --> 00:55:20,581
I am sick of
being different.

1169
00:55:20,682 --> 00:55:22,083
<i>What is wrong</i>
<i>with fitting in?</i>

1170
00:55:22,184 --> 00:55:24,352
Anyone can fit in.

1171
00:55:24,453 --> 00:55:26,654
Different, now that
takes imagination.

1172
00:55:26,755 --> 00:55:28,039
Does it?
Or is it a crutch?

1173
00:55:32,144 --> 00:55:33,528
<sneezes>

1174
00:55:33,629 --> 00:55:35,697
Bless you.

1175
00:55:35,798 --> 00:55:37,332
Are you wearing
cologne?

1176
00:55:37,433 --> 00:55:38,817
Yeah.

1177
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:40,485
And this stuff isn't
even on the market yet.

1178
00:55:40,586 --> 00:55:42,186
My agent wants to make sure
that if I do go Number One

1179
00:55:42,287 --> 00:55:43,922
there's a scent
that I can stand by.

1180
00:55:45,891 --> 00:55:48,226
<sneezes>

1181
00:55:48,327 --> 00:55:51,396
Farley, I have a severe
fragrance allergy.

1182
00:55:52,798 --> 00:55:55,533
I thought you knew that.

1183
00:55:55,535 --> 00:55:58,052
Guess I forgot.

1184
00:55:58,153 --> 00:56:00,004
You know what
else you forgot?

1185
00:56:00,105 --> 00:56:01,573
My birthday.

1186
00:56:01,674 --> 00:56:03,341
It was yesterday.

1187
00:56:03,442 --> 00:56:04,476
Oh, Eve,
I'm--

1188
00:56:04,577 --> 00:56:06,027
<i>I shouldn't have even</i>
<i>mentioned it, Farley.</i>

1189
00:56:06,128 --> 00:56:08,363
Honestly,
I could care less.

1190
00:56:08,464 --> 00:56:11,500
Birthdays are
overrated anyway.

1191
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:13,852
<i>People change,</i>
<i>priorities shift.</i>

1192
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:16,421
We move on.

1193
00:56:16,522 --> 00:56:17,872
<i><sneezes></i>

1194
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:30,518
Happy Birthday.

1195
00:56:30,619 --> 00:56:33,138
<i>May all your</i>
<i>wishes come true.</i>

1196
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,691
Marco."

1197
00:56:36,792 --> 00:56:39,394
¶

1198
00:56:39,495 --> 00:56:40,745
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>Mama's boy.</i>

1199
00:56:40,829 --> 00:56:41,663
Ow!
Hey!

1200
00:56:41,764 --> 00:56:43,381
Leave me alone,
ass-face!

1201
00:56:43,383 --> 00:56:44,665
What are you going
to do about it, huh?

1202
00:56:46,635 --> 00:56:47,702
Come on.
Come on, kid.

1203
00:56:55,027 --> 00:56:56,844
What?

1204
00:56:56,945 --> 00:56:57,928
It's a quotation
from Ghandi.

1205
00:56:58,030 --> 00:56:59,631
You should look it up.

1206
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:03,618
Damn it!

1207
00:57:03,719 --> 00:57:09,124
¶

1208
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:11,526
¶ Farley,
we love you. ¶

1209
00:57:11,627 --> 00:57:14,429
¶ But this has gone on
way too long. ¶

1210
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:16,631
¶ Stop being stubborn ¶

1211
00:57:16,732 --> 00:57:19,667
¶ and just admit
that you were wrong. ¶

1212
00:57:19,768 --> 00:57:23,371
¶ Joining the team
was a huge mistake. ¶

1213
00:57:23,472 --> 00:57:25,056
¶ Huge mistake. ¶

1214
00:57:25,157 --> 00:57:27,391
¶ It's made you miserable ¶

1215
00:57:27,492 --> 00:57:29,661

<i>¶ This behaviour is</i>

1220
00:57:40,973 --> 00:57:44,609

¶ Yeah, just whose ideals

1225
00:57:55,621 --> 00:57:56,721

Stop!

00:58:16,091 --> 00:58:17,759
Stop!

¶ And now this conversation
is officially off-limits . ¶

1243
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:38,379
<i>¶ Ordinary boy. ¶</i>

1244
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,816

this nonsense Damn it! ¶

¶

1246
00:58:55,163 --> 00:58:57,632
Let Marco be honest.
Your G-string playing --

1247
00:58:57,733 --> 00:59:00,018
<i>pure religion.</i>

1248
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:01,852
Marco has written,

1249
00:59:01,953 --> 00:59:04,472
how you say,
a regalo?

1250
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:06,741
Oh,
a gift to you

1251
00:59:06,842 --> 00:59:08,577
from the passion.

1252
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:12,246
No...
the heart.

1253
00:59:12,347 --> 00:59:13,748
To you.

1255
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:24,175
¶ You ask me if I love you ¶

1256
00:59:24,276 --> 00:59:30,515
<i>¶ and I choke on my reply. ¶</i>

1257
00:59:30,616 --> 00:59:36,888
¶ I'd rather
hurt you honestly ¶

1258
00:59:36,989 --> 00:59:42,260
<i>¶ than mislead</i>
<i>you with a lie. ¶</i>

1259

¶

1260
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:52,937
You didn't write that.

1261
00:59:53,038 --> 00:59:55,806
Assurdo!
Of course Marco did.

1262
00:59:55,875 --> 00:59:58,893
No, you didn't.
It's a Dan Hill song.

1263
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:01,412
My parents danced to
it at their wedding.

1264
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,314
They're divorced.

1265
01:00:03,415 --> 01:00:04,549
No.

1266
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:06,684
No, no, no,
it is not.

1267
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:12,106
¶ And sometimes
when we touch ¶

1268
01:00:12,207 --> 01:00:15,242
<i>¶ the honesty's too much. ¶</i>

1269
01:00:15,344 --> 01:00:18,079
<i>¶ And I have</i>
<i>to close my eyes ¶</i>

1270
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:20,915
¶ and hide. ¶

1271
01:00:21,033 --> 01:00:24,869

1276
01:00:48,927 --> 01:00:50,828
Marco!

1277
01:00:50,929 --> 01:00:53,064
Any reason you just
French-kissed me without

1278
01:00:53,165 --> 01:00:55,733
getting your passport
stamped first?

1279
01:00:55,834 --> 01:00:57,485
Oh,
Eve.

1280
01:00:57,586 --> 01:01:00,154
You think Marco does not
know what is going on?

1281
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,658
<i>Every time you caress</i>
<i>your cello, please,</i>

1282
01:01:03,759 --> 01:01:06,343
you mentally
caress Marco.

¶

1284
01:01:10,482 --> 01:01:13,350
Marco,

1285
01:01:13,451 --> 01:01:15,352
the real estate
<i>of my heart</i>

1286
01:01:15,453 --> 01:01:17,271
has already been sold.

1287
01:01:19,441 --> 01:01:21,476
Him?

1288
01:01:21,576 --> 01:01:23,677
The ragazzo?

1289
01:01:23,778 --> 01:01:27,282
He's more him than
you'll ever be.

1290
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:40,812
¶

1291
01:01:40,913 --> 01:01:43,781
¶ What is happening to me? ¶

1292
01:01:43,882 --> 01:01:47,985
¶ Was it only weeks ago
that I was carefree? ¶

1293
01:01:48,086 --> 01:01:51,605
¶ Life was simple.
Life was easy. ¶

1294
01:01:51,706 --> 01:01:55,592
¶ Seeing Eve with Marco
made me queasy. ¶

1295
01:01:55,694 --> 01:02:00,031
<i>¶ I Never imagined that I</i>
<i>would have feelings for her. ¶</i>

1296
01:02:00,132 --> 01:02:03,067
¶

1297
01:02:03,169 --> 01:02:04,903
¶ That weren't all chaste. ¶

1298
01:02:05,004 --> 01:02:08,606
¶ That weren't exactly
all pure. ¶

1299
01:02:08,707 --> 01:02:10,842
¶

1300
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:12,777
¶ Eve's my soul mate. ¶

1301
01:02:12,878 --> 01:02:14,312
¶ Isn't it ironic? ¶

1302
01:02:14,413 --> 01:02:16,380
¶ Eve's my soul mate. ¶

1303
01:02:16,481 --> 01:02:19,317
¶ I wish that it
wasn't platonic. ¶

1304
01:02:19,418 --> 01:02:20,584
¶

1305
01:02:20,853 --> 01:02:24,572
¶ You were always the
boy in the bubble. ¶

1306
01:02:24,673 --> 01:02:28,342
¶ Reality gave,
gave you trouble. ¶

1307
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:32,029
<i>¶ So you've got some feelings</i>
<i>for your best friend. ¶</i>

1308
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:35,716
¶ Let her know,
the world won't end. ¶

1309
01:02:35,817 --> 01:02:39,320
¶ Please, Eve's like
a sister to me. ¶

1310
01:02:39,421 --> 01:02:41,289
¶ These feelings
are creeping, ¶

1311
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:43,691
¶ creeping into
impropriety. ¶

1312
01:02:43,792 --> 01:02:47,161
¶ Last time I checked,
you're not related. ¶

1313
01:02:47,262 --> 01:02:51,081
¶ Don't deny it.
Don't debate it. ¶

1314
01:02:51,182 --> 01:02:54,235
¶ Maybe the girl wants
to get freaky with you. ¶

1315
01:02:54,336 --> 01:02:56,603
¶ Who knows? She wants
to squeeze your bones. ¶

1316
01:02:56,704 --> 01:02:58,605
¶ She wants to
rub your nose. ¶

1317
01:02:58,706 --> 01:03:02,159
¶ Boys, thanks for the
female insights, ¶

1318
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:03,394
¶ but,
trust me, ¶

1319
01:03:03,495 --> 01:03:06,731
¶ Eve doesn't want to
turn out the lights. ¶

1320
01:03:06,832 --> 01:03:08,766
¶ You've got to man up
with your woman ¶

1321
01:03:08,867 --> 01:03:10,067
¶ and hockey fights. ¶

1322
01:03:10,168 --> 01:03:13,888
¶ I swear that you'll start
sleeping better at night. ¶

1323
01:03:13,989 --> 01:03:15,823
¶ Speaking of sleep, ¶

1324
01:03:15,924 --> 01:03:18,392
¶ I've got
to go to bed. ¶

1325
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:21,612
¶

1326
01:03:21,713 --> 01:03:23,414
¶ Honestly,
Farley, ¶

1327
01:03:23,515 --> 01:03:27,652
¶ try and get your
ass out of your head. ¶

1328
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:41,515
<i>Hey,</i>
<i>Farley.</i>

1329
01:03:41,616 --> 01:03:43,684
Are you coming to
my recital tomorrow?

1330
01:03:45,354 --> 01:03:47,821
I can't.
I've got stuff to do.

1331
01:03:47,922 --> 01:03:49,190
But you've never
missed one yet.

1332
01:03:49,291 --> 01:03:50,924
You're my
good luck charm.

1333
01:03:51,026 --> 01:03:52,626
Well,
I'm sure you'll be fine,

1334
01:03:52,727 --> 01:03:55,029
especially with Marco
there by your side.

1335
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:56,397
What's that
supposed to mean?

1336
01:03:56,498 --> 01:03:58,265
Nothing.

1337
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,251
Come on,
Farley.

1338
01:04:00,352 --> 01:04:01,786
I know you
better than that.

1339
01:04:01,887 --> 01:04:03,537
Honestly,
nothing.

1340
01:04:03,638 --> 01:04:06,223
You two make
a great couple.

1341
01:04:06,325 --> 01:04:10,978
¶ Sarcasm really doesn't
suit you that well. ¶

1342
01:04:11,079 --> 01:04:13,848
<i>¶ What's with</i>
<i>the attitude? ¶</i>

1343
01:04:13,949 --> 01:04:16,200
¶ Hey,
what the hell? ¶

1344
01:04:16,335 --> 01:04:18,802
¶ You say you don't
have any feelings ¶

1345
01:04:18,903 --> 01:04:20,938
¶ for that
Italian fellow. ¶

1346
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:24,142
¶ So why did I catch you
playing tonsil hockey ¶

1347
01:04:24,243 --> 01:04:26,144
<i>¶ instead of the cello? ¶</i>

1348
01:04:26,245 --> 01:04:30,814
¶ Farley, you're making
an awful mistake ¶

1349
01:04:30,915 --> 01:04:36,020
¶ To him, I did not my
heart and saliva forsake. ¶

1350
01:04:36,155 --> 01:04:38,605
¶ Eve,
I was there. ¶

1351
01:04:38,706 --> 01:04:41,042
¶ I saw what I saw. ¶

1352
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:44,946
¶ The passion was real. ¶

1353
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:47,148
<i>¶ The passion was raw. ¶</i>

1354
01:04:47,282 --> 01:04:51,135
¶

1355
01:04:51,236 --> 01:04:55,940
¶ What does it
matter to you anyway? ¶

1356
01:04:56,041 --> 01:05:00,712
¶ What, oh what,
do you want me to say? ¶

1357
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:05,850
¶ I won't defend myself
or my reputation. ¶

1358
01:05:05,951 --> 01:05:07,952
¶ If you're
calling me a liar ¶

1359
01:05:08,053 --> 01:05:11,188
¶ let's end
this conversation. ¶

1360
01:05:11,256 --> 01:05:15,943
¶ Fine, if that's
how it's going to be ¶

1361
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:21,115
<i>¶ I have nothing more to</i>
<i>add to your hypocrisy. ¶</i>

1362
01:05:21,216 --> 01:05:26,020
¶ Farley, I don't understand
who you've become. ¶

1363

<i>¶ The boy that I once knew ¶</i>

Leave me alone! ¶

1373

¶ What are you going
to do about it? ¶

1374
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:06,043
¶ Write a poem? ¶

1375

You ready?

¶ I'm jonesing to unleash
these fists of fury. ¶

1387

1414
01:07:56,938 --> 01:08:00,540
¶ held a surprising allure. ¶

1415
01:08:00,642 --> 01:08:04,278
¶ It's clear that I have
lost myself in this game. ¶

1416
01:08:04,379 --> 01:08:06,080
¶

1417
01:08:06,181 --> 01:08:08,816
¶ This person before me
is Farley Gordon ¶

1418
01:08:08,917 --> 01:08:11,718
¶ only in name. ¶

1419
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:18,625
¶

1420
01:08:18,726 --> 01:08:20,861
¶ These cheers are hollow. ¶

1421
01:08:20,962 --> 01:08:23,530
¶ They are in vain. ¶

1422
01:08:23,631 --> 01:08:25,199
¶ Forcing my resolve ¶

1423
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:29,270
¶ never to
play hockey again. ¶

1424
01:08:29,370 --> 01:08:31,438
¶ Where are you going? ¶

1425
01:08:31,539 --> 01:08:34,741
¶ I want to hug
you with pride. ¶

1426
01:08:34,843 --> 01:08:37,778
¶ Back where I belong... ¶

1427
01:08:37,879 --> 01:08:40,414
¶ Outside. ¶

1428
01:08:40,515 --> 01:09:07,275
¶

1429
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:10,344
I'd like to
sincerely apologize

1430
01:09:10,445 --> 01:09:13,113
to everybody
who supported me.

1431
01:09:13,214 --> 01:09:15,566
It's now official.
Farley Gordon,

1432
01:09:15,667 --> 01:09:17,702
<i>that teen sensation we've</i>
<i>been telling you about,</i>

1433
01:09:17,803 --> 01:09:19,653
<i>well, he has now</i>
<i>announced that</i>

1434
01:09:19,754 --> 01:09:21,087
<i>he's quitting hockey.</i>

1435
01:09:21,973 --> 01:09:23,441
Ugh!

1436
01:09:24,742 --> 01:09:33,267
¶

1437
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:41,292
Marco.

1438
01:09:42,327 --> 01:09:45,146
My soul has
heavy weather.

1439
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:47,348
Why?
What's wrong?

1440
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:48,749
<i>I ache for</i>
<i>my true blossom.</i>

1441
01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:51,218
Please don't
talk about Eve.

1442
01:09:51,336 --> 01:09:53,253
No,
is sole Italiana.

1443
01:09:53,354 --> 01:09:55,256
But I saw
you two kissing.

1444
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:56,457
<i>Where?</i>

1445
01:09:56,558 --> 01:09:58,459
At the
rehearsal space.

1446
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,128
<i>Pfft! No, Marco</i>
<i>tried to kiss Eve,</i>

1447
01:10:01,229 --> 01:10:03,464
but she spit out
my advance like

1448
01:10:03,565 --> 01:10:05,099
wine from the box.

1449
01:10:06,968 --> 01:10:08,536
Really?

1450
01:10:08,636 --> 01:10:11,739
<i>Even now,</i>
<i>voicing it aloud,</i>

1451
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,841
it seems so...

1452
01:10:13,942 --> 01:10:15,843
so incredible.

1453
01:10:19,014 --> 01:10:22,049
<Italian>

1454
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:24,485
¶

1455
01:10:24,586 --> 01:10:28,722
¶ You ask me
if I love you. ¶

1456
01:10:28,823 --> 01:10:33,194
¶ And I choke
on my reply. ¶

1457
01:10:33,295 --> 01:10:39,950
¶

1458
01:10:40,051 --> 01:10:49,176
<news caster in background>

1459
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:56,049
¶

1460
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:58,252
¶ What has happened? ¶

1461
01:10:58,353 --> 01:11:01,054
¶ Why can't I concentrate? ¶

1462
01:11:01,156 --> 01:11:03,391
¶ Aristotle is Aris-Notle. ¶

1463
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:06,059
¶ Socrates is not
worth the debate. ¶

1464
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:08,296
¶ philosophy used to be ¶

1465
01:11:08,397 --> 01:11:11,231
¶ jet fuel for my brain ¶

1466
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:12,833
¶ Now reading a page ¶

1467
01:11:12,934 --> 01:11:16,370
¶ is positively Herculean. ¶

1468
01:11:16,471 --> 01:11:21,776
¶

1469
01:11:21,876 --> 01:11:23,277
¶ Since I quit, ¶

1470
01:11:23,378 --> 01:11:26,547
¶ the game obviously
holds no allure. ¶

1471
01:11:26,648 --> 01:11:31,735
¶

1472
01:11:31,836 --> 01:11:33,403
¶ But for my blues,

1473
01:11:33,504 --> 01:11:36,741
¶ even art doesn't
offer a cure. ¶

1474
01:11:36,842 --> 01:11:42,412
¶

1475
01:11:42,513 --> 01:11:46,950
<i>¶ How did I ever</i>
<i>become so vain? ¶</i>

1476
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:52,640
<i>¶ Could modelling underwear</i>
<i>be any more lame? ¶</i>

1477
01:11:52,740 --> 01:12:00,047
¶

1478
01:12:00,148 --> 01:12:02,316
<i>¶ Eve,</i>
<i>oh, Eve. ¶</i>

1479
01:12:02,417 --> 01:12:05,152
¶ How I miss her so. ¶

1480
01:12:05,253 --> 01:12:09,156
¶ But I can't find a way
past our current embargo. ¶

1481
01:12:09,257 --> 01:12:10,757
¶

1482
01:12:10,858 --> 01:12:12,193
¶ I try to
remain positive, ¶

1483
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:15,462
¶ But I lose hope
she'll be gone forever. ¶

1484
01:12:15,564 --> 01:12:17,698
¶ I wish she'd
give me a call ¶

1485
01:12:17,799 --> 01:12:20,167
¶ or send me a letter. ¶

1486
01:12:20,268 --> 01:12:30,043
¶

1487
01:12:30,144 --> 01:12:32,145
¶ My world which
once seemed so full ¶

1488
01:12:32,247 --> 01:12:34,515
¶ of music and light ¶

1489
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:37,751
¶ has been reduced
to a monochrome ¶

1490
01:12:37,852 --> 01:12:39,687
¶ black and white. ¶

1491
01:12:39,787 --> 01:12:49,530
¶

1492
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:51,381
<i>¶ He sleeps all day. ¶</i>

1493
01:12:51,483 --> 01:12:54,200
¶ He's no longer engaged. ¶

1494
01:12:54,301 --> 01:12:56,520
<i>¶ My diagnosis: ¶</i>

1495
01:12:56,621 --> 01:12:59,006
¶ Adolescent malaise. ¶

1496
01:12:59,107 --> 01:13:01,475
¶ Is there a cure? ¶

1497
01:13:01,576 --> 01:13:04,111
¶ Anything we can do? ¶

1498
01:13:04,212 --> 01:13:06,646
¶ Well, hopefully,
he'll grow out of it ¶

1499
01:13:06,748 --> 01:13:09,016
¶ in a year or two. ¶

1500
01:13:09,117 --> 01:13:30,187
¶

1501
01:13:30,288 --> 01:13:31,722
Oh,
son.

1502
01:13:35,426 --> 01:13:39,396
Farley, we've made a
huge parenting mistake.

1503
01:13:41,465 --> 01:13:43,834
<i>All we wanted was for you</i>

1504
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:46,586
<i>to find your inner utopia.</i>

1505
01:13:46,687 --> 01:13:50,057
And if hockey
was that utopia then

1506
01:13:50,158 --> 01:13:52,960
we should have
opened the gates.

1507
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:55,296
And,
instead,

1508
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:58,732
we threw away the
keys to the kingdom.

1509
01:13:58,833 --> 01:14:00,684
Well, you saw what
happened on the ice.

1510
01:14:00,785 --> 01:14:02,519
What I did,
what I became.

1511
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:05,589
<i>True,</i>
<i>the violence was ugly</i>

1512
01:14:05,891 --> 01:14:07,575
but where we failed
was in helping you

1513
01:14:07,676 --> 01:14:10,177
to navigate the nasty,

1514
01:14:10,278 --> 01:14:12,179
to sidestep the savagery,

1515
01:14:12,481 --> 01:14:14,264
<i>to dance through the dark,</i>

1516
01:14:14,365 --> 01:14:15,749
<i>to frolic through</i>
<i>the ferocity</i>

1517
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:16,750
and trounce the--

1518
01:14:16,851 --> 01:14:18,952
No,
no, no.

1519
01:14:19,053 --> 01:14:20,921
Yeah.

1520
01:14:21,022 --> 01:14:23,657
What we're trying to say,
Farley, is we're...

1521
01:14:23,758 --> 01:14:25,559
we're so sorry.

1522
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:29,363
¶

1523
01:14:29,464 --> 01:14:31,514
¶ I barely remember ¶

1524
01:14:31,616 --> 01:14:34,117
¶ those weeks that went by. ¶

1525
01:14:34,218 --> 01:14:37,520
¶ Except for the
constant, irresistible cry ¶

1526
01:14:37,622 --> 01:14:42,759
¶ of the ice urging
me to come skate. ¶

1527
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:45,095
¶ But I made my decision ¶

1528
01:14:45,196 --> 01:14:48,431
¶ I sealed my hockey fate. ¶

1529
01:14:48,532 --> 01:14:49,900
<i>¶ However,</i>
<i>my resolve, ¶</i>

1530
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:52,519
<i>¶ which once</i>
<i>seemed so strong ¶</i>

1531
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:54,388
¶ started to waiver ¶

1532
01:14:54,489 --> 01:14:57,491
¶ as my exile dragged on. ¶

1533
01:14:57,592 --> 01:15:01,128
¶ I'm the addict
tempted by vice. ¶

1534
01:15:01,229 --> 01:15:05,633
¶ Too weak to resist
the lure of the ice. ¶

1535
01:15:05,734 --> 01:15:06,900
¶

1536
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:10,637
¶ Has hockey corrupted
my very soul? ¶

1537
01:15:10,738 --> 01:15:12,956
¶ It was always a game ¶

1538
01:15:13,057 --> 01:15:15,625
¶ and never a life goal. ¶

1539
01:15:20,331 --> 01:15:26,236
¶

1540
01:15:26,337 --> 01:15:29,956
¶ Am I dreaming?
I must be asleep. ¶

1541
01:15:30,057 --> 01:15:33,844
¶ Why is Walter Gretzky
on this rink? ¶

1542
01:15:33,945 --> 01:15:34,911
¶

1543
01:15:35,013 --> 01:15:36,496
¶ The power of hockey ¶

1544
01:15:36,597 --> 01:15:38,631
¶ works in mysterious ways. ¶

1545
01:15:38,733 --> 01:15:40,717
¶

1546
01:15:40,818 --> 01:15:41,952
We're here
to see you past

1547
01:15:42,053 --> 01:15:44,421
this miserable phase.

1548
01:15:44,522 --> 01:15:47,374
¶

1549
01:15:47,475 --> 01:15:51,045
¶ We all know hockey's the
best sport on the planet. ¶

1550
01:15:51,146 --> 01:15:52,879
<i>¶ Theo Fleury's singing, ¶</i>

1551
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:56,200
<i>¶ What can't he do,</i>
<i>damn it? ¶</i>

1552
01:15:56,301 --> 01:16:00,086
¶ Play your own game.
To thine own self be true. ¶

1553
01:16:00,288 --> 01:16:02,506
¶ Don't let a couple
of punches... ¶

1554
01:16:02,607 --> 01:16:04,842
¶ defeat you. ¶

1555
01:16:04,943 --> 01:16:06,910
¶ 'Cause hockey's
the greatest ¶

1556
01:16:07,011 --> 01:16:09,412
¶ game in the land. ¶

1557
01:16:09,514 --> 01:16:13,700
¶ You've got the goods
to be your own man. ¶

1558
01:16:13,801 --> 01:16:16,319
¶ 'Cause hockey's
the greatest ¶

1559
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:18,722
¶ game in the land. ¶

1560
01:16:18,823 --> 01:16:23,293
¶ Time to change the plan. ¶

1561
01:16:23,394 --> 01:16:33,136
¶

1562
01:16:33,237 --> 01:16:35,005
¶ Could they be
onto something? ¶

1563
01:16:35,106 --> 01:16:37,107
¶ Could they be right? ¶

1564
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:39,076
¶ I'm starting to see
this whole world ¶

1565
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:41,712
¶ in a different light. ¶

1566
01:16:41,813 --> 01:16:43,613
¶ Maybe just maybe, ¶

1567
01:16:43,715 --> 01:16:46,482
¶ it's more heroic to play ¶

1568
01:16:46,634 --> 01:16:51,838
¶ To search my soul,
to find a new way. ¶

1569
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:59,312
¶

1570
01:17:11,308 --> 01:17:14,294
I should have
guessed it was you.

1571
01:17:14,395 --> 01:17:15,662
Hey,
Eve.

1572
01:17:15,763 --> 01:17:17,931
I didn't realize that
the window was open.

1573
01:17:20,001 --> 01:17:20,967
You know, it's not
great for the environment

1574
01:17:21,068 --> 01:17:23,387
to waste all
that heat, right?

1575
01:17:23,488 --> 01:17:26,322
I can't shut my radiator
off, David Suzuki.

1576
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:31,061
What do you want?

1577
01:17:33,097 --> 01:17:34,731
¶

1578
01:17:34,832 --> 01:17:38,001
¶ Eve ¶

1579
01:17:38,102 --> 01:17:43,923
<i>¶ dear Eve</i>
<i>I've come to apologize ¶</i>

1580
01:17:44,025 --> 01:17:46,660

01:17:46,761 --> 01:17:49,029
¶

1582
01:17:49,130 --> 01:17:54,668
<i>¶ For putting</i>

1583
01:17:54,769 --> 01:17:56,135
¶

1584
01:17:56,237 --> 01:17:59,339
¶ There's... ¶

1585
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:03,410
¶ There's one thing
that I need to confess. ¶

1586
01:18:03,511 --> 01:18:05,279
¶

1587
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:08,582
<i>¶ You're more</i>

¶

1589
01:18:11,152 --> 01:18:15,822

always seemed like ¶

¶ a sister to me. ¶

1595
01:18:28,218 --> 01:18:30,370
<i>¶ So when I began</i>

1596
01:18:30,471 --> 01:18:33,173
<i>¶ in a more romantic light ¶</i>

1597

¶ so valiantly to fight ¶

1599

1600
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:44,134
¶

1601
01:18:44,235 --> 01:18:49,756
¶ That you'd think my
love was, well, rude. ¶

1602
01:18:49,857 --> 01:18:53,944
¶

1603
01:18:54,045 --> 01:18:55,946

¶ How did I
miss that feeling? ¶

1609
01:19:18,736 --> 01:19:22,906
¶ It's so obviously
contagious. ¶

1610
01:19:23,007 --> 01:19:25,692
¶

1611
01:19:25,794 --> 01:19:30,463

¶ fits into the mix. ¶

1613
01:19:33,518 --> 01:19:35,184

¶ Let's make
one thing clear ¶

1615
01:19:39,089 --> 01:19:44,160
¶ I only like men who
skate with sticks. ¶

1616
01:19:44,261 --> 01:19:46,462

1619
01:19:51,769 --> 01:19:54,070
¶ You're everything
I've wanted ¶

1620

¶ You're this girl's dream ¶

1621
01:19:57,575 --> 01:19:59,308
¶ There's just
one more thing ¶

1622
01:19:59,410 --> 01:20:01,878
¶ to add to this refrain ¶

1623
01:20:01,979 --> 01:20:07,183

¶ You're not upset
With my choice? ¶

1633
01:20:48,359 --> 01:20:51,244
¶ Of course not.
Hockey's your muse. ¶

1634
01:20:51,345 --> 01:20:54,247
¶ Hockey's your voice. ¶

1635
01:20:54,348 --> 01:20:56,383
¶ Please just promise ¶

1636

¶ Funny,
that's what someone else ¶

1639
01:21:05,476 --> 01:21:09,346
¶ said I should do. ¶

1640
01:21:09,447 --> 01:21:14,784
¶

1641
01:21:17,938 --> 01:21:19,439
<i>Mum, Dad,</i>
<i>wake up!</i>

1642
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:20,640
Oh.                       Death?

1643
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:21,474
Where's the dog?

1644
01:21:21,575 --> 01:21:22,842
Who?

1645
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:23,843
<i>The dog.</i>
<i>Where's--</i>

1646
01:21:23,945 --> 01:21:25,378
Listen...

1647
01:21:25,479 --> 01:21:26,813
<i>I'm going to play</i>
<i>hockey again.</i>

1648
01:21:30,467 --> 01:21:32,786
Respect, courage, heart!

1649
01:21:32,887 --> 01:21:35,922
So I don't care
how tired you are,

1650
01:21:36,023 --> 01:21:37,941
we play two-way
hockey tonight!

1651
01:21:38,042 --> 01:21:39,509
<i>When your man</i>
<i>skates up to you--</i>

1652
01:21:42,629 --> 01:21:44,297
What the hell
are you doing here?

1653
01:21:44,398 --> 01:21:46,266
Coach, I'm here to
rejoin the team.

1654
01:21:49,336 --> 01:21:50,336
Last time I checked,
you quit because

1655
01:21:50,438 --> 01:21:52,739
the rough stuff offended
your sensibilities.

1656
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,608
So I hate to break it
to you there buttercup,

1657
01:21:54,709 --> 01:21:57,194
but we still don't do
delicate in this league.

1658
01:21:57,295 --> 01:21:59,196
I think you're oversimplifying

1659
01:21:59,297 --> 01:22:01,264
the argument considerably.

1660
01:22:01,365 --> 01:22:02,899
<i>Coach...</i>

1661
01:22:03,067 --> 01:22:06,085
¶

1662
01:22:06,186 --> 01:22:07,687
Can I say something?

1663
01:22:07,788 --> 01:22:08,921
¶

1664
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:10,190
Really?
Right now?

1665
01:22:10,291 --> 01:22:14,894
¶

1666
01:22:14,996 --> 01:22:16,463
¶ After you quit, ¶

1667
01:22:16,564 --> 01:22:18,031
¶ we had a team meeting. ¶

1668
01:22:18,132 --> 01:22:19,699
¶ Behind closed doors, ¶

1669
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,568
¶ in spite of my pleading ¶

1670
01:22:21,669 --> 01:22:22,902
¶ When you left the ice ¶

1671
01:22:23,037 --> 01:22:24,738
¶ on the brink of tears ¶

1672
01:22:25,005 --> 01:22:26,139
¶ It broke
something in us ¶

1673
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:27,791
¶ that had been
building for years. ¶

1674
01:22:27,892 --> 01:22:31,127
¶ We took an objective
look at our behaviour. ¶

1675
01:22:31,228 --> 01:22:34,247
¶ Asked some more questions
as to who's not in favour. ¶

1676
01:22:34,348 --> 01:22:37,483
¶ As the way of the fist as
a game's divine right ¶

1677
01:22:37,584 --> 01:22:39,152
¶ And proving
your manhood with

1678
01:22:39,253 --> 01:22:40,887
¶ how well you could fight. ¶

1679
01:22:40,988 --> 01:22:43,639
¶ I swear we channeled
the spirit ¶

1680
01:22:43,741 --> 01:22:47,744
¶ of Oprah in that room. ¶

1681
01:22:47,845 --> 01:22:50,213
¶ The catharsis was awesome. ¶

1682
01:22:50,281 --> 01:22:54,851
<i>¶ Especially for</i>
<i>this goon. ¶</i>

1683
01:22:54,952 --> 01:22:57,087
¶

1684
01:22:57,188 --> 01:22:59,789
¶ But, Farley, our conclusion
never changed the fact ¶

1685
01:22:59,890 --> 01:23:03,109
¶ That if you can't dance,
we can't watch your back. ¶

1686
01:23:03,210 --> 01:23:06,362
¶ Though we all agreed
pacifism has a place ¶

1687
01:23:06,463 --> 01:23:07,831
¶ Just not in hockey ¶

1688
01:23:07,932 --> 01:23:09,683
¶ 'cause we'll
all be disgraced. ¶

1689
01:23:09,784 --> 01:23:13,920
¶ Actually, I might have
another way we can embrace.

1690
01:23:14,021 --> 01:23:17,374
¶

1691
01:23:17,475 --> 01:23:20,927

it out instead ¶

Was your son
a late bloomer or...?

Are you from Mars?

01:28:12,219 --> 01:28:15,154
Oh,
no.

1791
01:28:15,289 --> 01:28:18,741
Do you have any advice
for a new hockey dad?

1792
01:28:18,842 --> 01:28:20,009
Give your son or
daughter

Boy, you see how much the
sticks cost now, though?

01:28:29,753 --> 01:28:31,821
I just saw
one for $200.

1799

My first stick was
one from the bush.

1800
01:28:34,758 --> 01:28:36,125
I cut a
tree branch down

1801
01:28:36,227 --> 01:28:37,694
and carved a hockey
stick out of it.

1802
01:28:37,794 --> 01:28:38,961
That was
my first stick.

1803
01:28:39,062 --> 01:28:39,962
Oh my gawd.

1804
01:28:40,063 --> 01:28:41,997
I lived on a farm.
Isn't that something?

1805
01:28:42,099 --> 01:28:43,466
That's amazing.

1806
01:28:43,567 --> 01:28:45,101
Come on,
we'll watch the game.

1807
01:28:45,202 --> 01:33:07,981
