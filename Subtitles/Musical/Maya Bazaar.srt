1
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,691
As Gods and Goddesses
shower their blessings...

2
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:34,099
Long live young Sasirekha...

3
00:04:37,775 --> 00:04:41,871
Blessed Revathi is thy your mother...

4
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:57,053
Blessing you to live happily...

5
00:05:07,605 --> 00:05:11,803
Balarama, who gives boons
before you ask is thy your father...

6
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,640
Blessing you promising
to fulfill all your wishes...

00:05:38,136 --> 00:05:47,306
Your aunt the blessed one
Rukmini Devi dotes you...

00:05:57,989 --> 00:06:07,125
The almighty Lord Krishna is your
uncle and protects you...

9
00:06:28,753 --> 00:06:38,025
Your paternal aunt Subhadra loves you...

10
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:57,739
Your aunt's son Abhimanyu, the Pandava
prince considers you as his world...

11
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:18,027
l'll see the fruit in water
and aim it.

12
00:07:18,736 --> 00:07:19,703
Hit it!

13
00:07:22,073 --> 00:07:24,098
Well done!

14
00:07:24,308 --> 00:07:27,300
Did you see it?
- ls it great to aim watching it?

15
00:07:28,212 --> 00:07:29,804
Then, l'll show you another skill.

16
00:07:30,014 --> 00:07:33,006
Keep this fruit on head,
l'll hit it without hurting them.

17
00:07:33,217 --> 00:07:35,412
What?
- Oh no! We are scared!

18
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:37,152
How about you stubborn girl?

19
00:07:41,225 --> 00:07:42,351
Hit it, let me see it.

20
00:07:42,727 --> 00:07:45,059
May be you'll move in fear.
Close your eyes.

21
00:07:45,263 --> 00:07:46,423
l'm not afraid.

22
00:07:46,798 --> 00:07:48,322
ls this what you're playing?

23
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:49,795
Aunt, move out of my way.

24
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:52,697
Aimed arrow shouldn't go waste.

25
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:53,962
Vow!

26
00:07:54,172 --> 00:07:56,970
Can you aim arrow
as skillfully as l do?

27
00:07:57,175 --> 00:07:59,973
Show me, l'll do it better than you.

28
00:08:00,178 --> 00:08:01,509
Give it to me.

29
00:08:03,915 --> 00:08:06,748
Can you use it as
skillfully as my mother?

30
00:08:06,951 --> 00:08:10,148
Then, come with me,
l'll show my skill before your mother.

31
00:08:10,354 --> 00:08:11,981
Mother, hit the fruit.

32
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,886
You're responsible for everything.
Come.

33
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,064
Carrying the bow and arrow,

34
00:08:29,273 --> 00:08:32,299
isn't your sister-in-law looking
like Goddess Tripurasundari?

35
00:08:34,045 --> 00:08:35,034
What is it, sister-in-law?

36
00:08:35,246 --> 00:08:36,941
Did you see what your son is up to?

37
00:08:37,148 --> 00:08:40,777
Sasi is standing with a fruit on head
and he's aiming to hit it.

38
00:08:40,985 --> 00:08:42,953
What would happen if arrow hits her?

39
00:08:44,088 --> 00:08:47,023
You fear is unwarranted,
my son will never miss his target.

40
00:08:47,225 --> 00:08:49,159
Aunt, stand without getting scared,

41
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,555
l'll hit your nose pin
without hurting your nose.

42
00:08:51,996 --> 00:08:53,395
Well said, my nephew.

43
00:08:53,998 --> 00:08:55,898
Krishna, l'm telling now,

44
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:01,128
strength of all 5 Pandavas is equal
to my nephew's strength.

45
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:02,567
Remember that.

46
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:08,941
Ask what boon will brother grant
for giving birth to such a brave son.

47
00:09:09,013 --> 00:09:12,244
Make your wish, l'll grant it.

48
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:18,982
Let Sasi become my daughter-in-law,
what else can l seek from you, brother?

49
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,021
ls it any wish?

50
00:09:21,225 --> 00:09:23,125
We decided she's your daughter-in-law
the moment she was born.

51
00:09:23,327 --> 00:09:25,192
What do you say Rukmini?
- Yes.

52
00:09:25,396 --> 00:09:29,332
Are you still doubting them?
- Still having doubt,

53
00:09:29,634 --> 00:09:32,933
Sasi is your daughter-in-law, okay?

54
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:55,985
Go safely and come back safely.

55
00:09:56,294 --> 00:10:02,529
Tell l had inquired about Dharmaraju,
Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva,

56
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:08,202
and their mother Kunti Devi,
and Draupadi.

57
00:10:13,077 --> 00:10:14,635
Go carefully.

58
00:10:15,046 --> 00:10:19,073
May be you'll forget about us
after reaching there.

59
00:10:19,283 --> 00:10:22,411
Though said with a smile,
such words really hurt, sister-in-law.

60
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,019
Forget it.

61
00:10:24,355 --> 00:10:26,550
Why don't you stay with us, nephew?

62
00:10:26,924 --> 00:10:30,382
No, l'll not stay,
l'm taking Sasi with me.

63
00:10:30,595 --> 00:10:33,962
Good, like father like son.

64
00:10:34,298 --> 00:10:35,230
Yes.

65
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:37,560
What good? Come dear.

66
00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:40,234
l'll go with him.

67
00:10:40,438 --> 00:10:41,928
Let her come with us.

68
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:43,902
You asked casually today,

69
00:10:44,108 --> 00:10:46,576
when that day comes,
you'll ask sternly,

70
00:10:46,944 --> 00:10:48,241
and we can't avoid sending her.

71
00:10:48,446 --> 00:10:51,415
atleast let my daughter
stay with me till then.

72
00:10:51,616 --> 00:10:53,049
Come dear.

73
00:10:53,351 --> 00:10:55,410
Get her down.

74
00:10:56,721 --> 00:10:58,882
Come down dear.

75
00:10:59,357 --> 00:11:02,554
We will come back.
Come...get down.

76
00:11:02,927 --> 00:11:03,689
Come dear.

77
00:11:15,706 --> 00:11:17,606
Sasi bye.

78
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:20,135
We'll tell fortune for this
mischievous young girl...

79
00:12:45,296 --> 00:12:47,389
Buxom beauty in its full youth...

80
00:12:47,598 --> 00:12:50,533
Proud to meet your suitor...

81
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:58,600
Suitor is her world...

82
00:13:18,662 --> 00:13:23,565
Why are you angry to hear truth?

83
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,335
We will tell truth as it is...

84
00:13:31,609 --> 00:13:33,702
We will tell even if you say no...

85
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,172
Your suitor is man with
great skills and a genius...

86
00:13:41,685 --> 00:13:44,848
Very smart and intelligent too...

87
00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:10,245
He'll aim and hit with flowers...

88
00:14:15,352 --> 00:14:20,085
Our maiden gets enchanted...

89
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:23,454
And invites him to her marriage...

90
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:47,507
Madam Sasirekha, Lord Krishna
has arrived from lndraprastha.

91
00:14:47,718 --> 00:14:51,916
Has my paternal uncle come?
- Yes, he wants you there.

92
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:53,656
Yes.

93
00:14:54,258 --> 00:14:58,319
Brother, all the Sages are
attending the sacrifice,

94
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:03,592
Dharmaraju was sad not to
find you in that honoured group.

95
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:06,599
lt would've been great
had we joined them.

96
00:15:06,804 --> 00:15:07,828
Yes...yes...

97
00:15:08,472 --> 00:15:09,461
Yes brother.

98
00:15:09,673 --> 00:15:12,801
You're the epitome of truth,
and right choice for it,

99
00:15:13,177 --> 00:15:14,838
Dharmaraju has sent
this present to you.

100
00:15:15,212 --> 00:15:16,270
What is it?

101
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,374
Truth hidden in the three worlds,

102
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,780
it'll make them tell truth,

103
00:15:22,987 --> 00:15:25,217
it's the wonderful seat of truth.

104
00:15:25,422 --> 00:15:30,724
lt's said Sage Vishwamithra created
this in honour of King Harishchandra.

105
00:15:30,928 --> 00:15:32,828
Hear about it's affect.

106
00:15:33,364 --> 00:15:36,197
lf we make anyone sit on it,

107
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,801
it will make him tell the truth,

108
00:15:40,004 --> 00:15:42,199
what he's thinking,
what he may think in future,

109
00:15:42,406 --> 00:15:45,534
it will bring out every secret he has.

110
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,946
l never heard of such wonders
in this world.

111
00:15:50,114 --> 00:15:54,016
Sathyaki, keep it safely
in the prayer room.

112
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:57,311
Come Sasi...come.

113
00:15:59,123 --> 00:16:02,149
Where's the present sent to Sasi?

114
00:16:05,429 --> 00:16:08,125
Who sent it?
Will you give it without telling her?

115
00:16:08,332 --> 00:16:09,765
She knows it.

116
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:15,327
Sasi, go to your room and
open this box when alone.

117
00:16:23,314 --> 00:16:25,111
lt's love vision.

118
00:16:25,316 --> 00:16:29,685
lf you open the box,
it shows the thing you love most.

119
00:16:29,887 --> 00:16:33,084
Pandavas are really lucky.

120
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,087
Heaven has come down to their kingdom.

121
00:16:35,292 --> 00:16:37,726
Yes, lndra's son is also there.

122
00:16:37,928 --> 00:16:41,227
lf my brother Krishna wasn't with them,

123
00:16:41,432 --> 00:16:46,233
neither lndra's son nor lndra
himself could do anything.

124
00:16:46,904 --> 00:16:49,873
He successfully conducted
the great sacrifice,

125
00:16:50,074 --> 00:16:52,042
and got honoured in that
august assembly,

126
00:16:52,743 --> 00:16:55,075
and beheaded Sishupal
who objected it,

127
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,042
punished the guilty,

128
00:16:58,082 --> 00:17:01,051
Krishna, l must felicitate you,

129
00:17:01,518 --> 00:17:02,712
come here.

130
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:30,413
ls it you?

131
00:17:36,954 --> 00:17:40,117
ls it you who thought about me?

132
00:17:40,324 --> 00:17:43,725
ls it you who called me?

133
00:17:43,928 --> 00:17:50,458
ls it you who resides in my heart
and agitated it?

134
00:17:55,773 --> 00:17:58,867
lt is you who thought about me...

135
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:02,136
lt is you who called me...

136
00:18:02,346 --> 00:18:09,013
lt is you who resides in my heart
and agitated it...

137
00:18:09,219 --> 00:18:12,120
lt is you...

138
00:18:19,363 --> 00:18:26,792
Awake in dream...
a dream in that awaken time...

139
00:18:34,812 --> 00:18:41,980
ls it dream or God's myth?
ln a state of total confusion...

140
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,538
Filling my eyes with moonbeam...

141
00:19:09,913 --> 00:19:14,111
And making jasmine to
bloom in my heart...

142
00:19:24,028 --> 00:19:26,861
You melted my eyes and my heart...

143
00:19:27,064 --> 00:19:31,000
Spell bound me...
Pleased me...

144
00:20:01,098 --> 00:20:04,397
Present by Abhimanyu,
you liked it, Sasi?

145
00:20:05,903 --> 00:20:09,236
Why are you feeling so shy?
You saw him only.

146
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,568
Did she see him?

147
00:20:12,142 --> 00:20:16,238
Our daughter saw Abhimanyu.
lt's really effective.

148
00:20:16,447 --> 00:20:17,345
You too open and see it.

149
00:20:17,548 --> 00:20:20,244
You're very excited.
You open it first.

150
00:20:20,451 --> 00:20:22,419
Open it sister.

151
00:20:30,994 --> 00:20:37,263
Diamonds...jewels...silks...

152
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:45,531
lt's Goddess of Wealth everywhere.
What is this?

153
00:20:45,742 --> 00:20:49,007
What you like is wealth, that's it.

154
00:20:49,213 --> 00:20:52,273
l don't have any such wish,
don't know why it appeared.

155
00:20:52,483 --> 00:20:54,451
lt won't show what you don't desire.

156
00:20:54,651 --> 00:20:58,382
You're near me,
may be it's your desire.

157
00:20:58,589 --> 00:20:59,613
May be.

158
00:21:00,991 --> 00:21:03,516
But you will not accept
it's effectiveness.

159
00:21:03,727 --> 00:21:07,663
You open and see it,
after seeing that l may accept.

160
00:21:08,031 --> 00:21:10,556
Okay, l'll open it for you.

161
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,680
Why did Duryodhana appear?
lt's strange.

162
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:27,073
What's strange in it?

163
00:21:27,284 --> 00:21:31,380
Everyone know Duryodhana
is my favourite disciple.

164
00:21:32,589 --> 00:21:35,956
Krishna, you open it,
let's see who appears.

165
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,721
Everyone know, it'll be Arjuna.

166
00:21:40,097 --> 00:21:41,064
Do we've to see it , brother?

167
00:21:41,265 --> 00:21:44,393
Rukmini won't mind it,
open it Krishna.

168
00:21:44,601 --> 00:21:49,095
Okay, you shouldn't faint
if you see anyone else there.

169
00:21:49,306 --> 00:21:53,140
l don't know myself
who like most or hate.

170
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:11,352
Shakuni appeared inviting
for a game of dice.

171
00:22:11,562 --> 00:22:14,690
Will great men appear
for nothing, brother.

172
00:22:15,332 --> 00:22:17,129
Don't know what game he's planning?

173
00:22:19,836 --> 00:22:22,805
Great insult! Got cheated!

174
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,171
Dharmaraju conducted the
sacrifice to insult me.

175
00:22:27,444 --> 00:22:30,538
He created the Magic palace
to slander me.

176
00:22:30,747 --> 00:22:35,480
Vassal kings bowed before him
instead of me,

177
00:22:35,686 --> 00:22:38,120
and presented him with gifts and tax.

178
00:22:38,322 --> 00:22:43,225
l innocently distributed it
with my hands.

179
00:22:43,427 --> 00:22:48,330
Above all this that proud Draupadi
laughed at me.

180
00:22:48,532 --> 00:22:53,629
Before that insult burns me,
l'll sacrifice my life to fire.

181
00:22:53,837 --> 00:22:55,361
Arrange the fire.

182
00:22:55,572 --> 00:22:59,167
King! Why are you worried
when your friend Karna is here?

183
00:22:59,376 --> 00:23:00,707
Blow the war bugle,

184
00:23:01,078 --> 00:23:03,103
l'll kill Pandavas and
repay my gratitude.

185
00:23:03,313 --> 00:23:05,781
Well said Karna.
That's our immediate duty.

186
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:10,586
Why use an axe for something
that can be clipped with nail?

187
00:23:10,787 --> 00:23:13,085
lnvite Dharmaraju for gambling.

188
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,757
l'll play simple game of dice,

189
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:21,428
easily l'll win all their wealth
and present it to you.

190
00:23:21,632 --> 00:23:24,328
Winning and losing in
game is on God,

191
00:23:24,534 --> 00:23:25,466
what if we lose?

192
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:27,694
May this never come true.

193
00:23:27,904 --> 00:23:32,204
My dice will never lose.
Test it.

194
00:23:32,409 --> 00:23:35,207
Tell me your number.

195
00:23:36,346 --> 00:23:37,438
Two!

196
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:42,783
Wow uncle!
This is our immediate duty.

197
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,254
Karna, you tell now.

198
00:23:45,922 --> 00:23:49,255
lt's not heroic to hide your courage
and use cleverness.

199
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:53,256
No problem, Karna,
try to test my skill.

200
00:23:53,463 --> 00:23:54,896
Two again.

201
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,662
Wow uncle!

202
00:23:58,368 --> 00:24:00,768
Did you see Duryodhana?

203
00:24:01,138 --> 00:24:03,572
ldea in the brain and dice in hands.

204
00:24:03,774 --> 00:24:06,743
Your maternal uncle can ruin them easily.

205
00:24:06,943 --> 00:24:08,740
You too can test me.

206
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:14,479
Third time is very important.
- Okay, l'll also see. Same two.

207
00:24:14,918 --> 00:24:16,681
No, one!

208
00:24:18,188 --> 00:24:19,212
Wow uncle!

209
00:24:19,423 --> 00:24:23,519
Did you see it too fumbled
like you for one?

210
00:24:24,227 --> 00:24:25,751
lnvite Dharmaraju immediately.

211
00:24:25,962 --> 00:24:28,829
Yes brother,
that's our immediate duty.

212
00:24:31,435 --> 00:24:34,802
Duryodhana, one more thing,

213
00:24:35,172 --> 00:24:39,871
Dharmaraju is impulsive gambler,
he goes berserk on losing,

214
00:24:40,243 --> 00:24:42,677
you make him stake not just
kingdom but his brothers,

215
00:24:42,879 --> 00:24:49,307
himself and their wife Draupadi
too and lose them.

216
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:51,348
Now it's your wish.

217
00:24:51,555 --> 00:24:54,388
l feel you will do it, uncle.

218
00:24:54,591 --> 00:24:58,527
Brother, uncle's idea is cyclone,
a great cyclone.

219
00:25:15,412 --> 00:25:17,380
What's this bad omen, uncle?

220
00:25:17,581 --> 00:25:20,641
Bad omen when Shakuni is here, no way,

221
00:25:20,851 --> 00:25:23,547
these are omen of our
forthcoming victory.

222
00:25:23,754 --> 00:25:24,584
Don't get scared.

223
00:25:24,788 --> 00:25:28,315
Let your fears vanish,
my expertise of playing dice,

224
00:25:28,525 --> 00:25:33,292
even Krishna himself
will come to know it. Come.

225
00:25:52,582 --> 00:25:54,914
Did you hear this, Yashoda?

226
00:25:58,688 --> 00:26:02,590
Did you hear about pranks of
your little mischief Krishna?

227
00:26:07,664 --> 00:26:09,495
l don't know anything,
l wasn't here at all.

228
00:26:10,734 --> 00:26:16,400
Danced on the head of Kalindi snake
that poisoned the river Kalindi...

229
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:38,020
l killed the snake and protected
the cattle going for water there...

230
00:26:38,395 --> 00:26:52,867
Hey Krishna! Won't you hear
my appeal for help?

231
00:26:58,381 --> 00:27:12,694
lf you don't who will help
this woman in distress...

232
00:27:12,896 --> 00:27:17,993
Won't you see my pathetic condition?

233
00:27:18,368 --> 00:27:24,671
Krishna! What is this?

234
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:26,001
What happened?

235
00:27:26,443 --> 00:27:28,775
Kauravas evil designs have
crossed the limit.

236
00:27:29,145 --> 00:27:32,945
They not only took their kingdom,

237
00:27:33,149 --> 00:27:37,677
they insulted the Pandavas and
are exiling them to forest.

238
00:27:37,888 --> 00:27:39,856
Such injustice.

239
00:27:40,056 --> 00:27:42,718
So evil minded.
- Pride of Kauravas.

240
00:27:42,926 --> 00:27:45,724
We mustn't take this
injustice easily,

241
00:27:45,929 --> 00:27:48,693
brother, order me,
l'll go with army...

242
00:27:48,899 --> 00:27:51,493
Don't rush off.

243
00:27:51,701 --> 00:27:53,601
l too won't tolerate injustice.

244
00:27:53,803 --> 00:27:56,738
l'll go to Hastinapura and
teach a lesson to Kauravas,

245
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,033
and return the lost kingdom
to Pandavas.

246
00:27:59,743 --> 00:28:03,440
Duryodhana is my disciple,
he'll never go against me.

247
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,047
Get my chariot ready.

248
00:28:05,982 --> 00:28:07,381
Come dear.

249
00:28:07,651 --> 00:28:10,643
l was fearing about
Shakuni's evil plans.

250
00:28:10,854 --> 00:28:13,049
Who so ever does anything,
we face the consequences.

251
00:28:17,794 --> 00:28:20,558
Don't worry dear,
l'm there for them.

252
00:28:20,764 --> 00:28:21,992
Hail King!

253
00:28:22,198 --> 00:28:26,532
Received information about your
Guru Balarama visiting you.

254
00:28:27,003 --> 00:28:32,964
Take this for bringing
good news on time.

255
00:28:34,778 --> 00:28:37,747
Good news? Uncle, l'm scared.

256
00:28:37,948 --> 00:28:41,509
Why is he coming? Why?
He's short tempered.

257
00:28:41,718 --> 00:28:43,447
No problem.

258
00:28:43,653 --> 00:28:46,554
Best remedy for short temper is praise.

259
00:28:46,756 --> 00:28:49,020
Arrange to honour him grandly.

260
00:28:49,225 --> 00:28:54,458
Pleased with your felicitation,
he'll grant you boon.

261
00:28:54,664 --> 00:28:55,926
Take it.

262
00:28:58,868 --> 00:29:03,168
Get your son Lakshmana Kumar
married with his daughter Sasirekha.

263
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,804
With that Balarama will be on our side.

264
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:07,874
With him Yadavas will be on our side.

265
00:29:08,078 --> 00:29:12,708
With that Krishna will be forced
to join our ranks only.

266
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:15,111
Wow uncle!
That's our immediate duty.

267
00:29:15,485 --> 00:29:18,943
Uncle, politically our plan is good,

268
00:29:19,155 --> 00:29:22,215
but our Lakshmana Kumar
is more proud than his father.

269
00:29:22,592 --> 00:29:24,822
Will he accept the Yadava princess?

270
00:29:25,028 --> 00:29:29,124
He will accept,
that's my responsibility.

271
00:29:42,245 --> 00:29:43,041
Prince!

272
00:29:51,054 --> 00:29:51,816
Lord!

273
00:29:54,691 --> 00:30:00,186
Great warrior, braveheart,
Lakshmana Kumar...

274
00:30:00,563 --> 00:30:01,962
Enough of your praise.
- Okay.

275
00:30:02,165 --> 00:30:03,826
Lord, hear me.

276
00:30:04,034 --> 00:30:09,165
You're great than Abhimanyu...

277
00:30:12,976 --> 00:30:14,500
Then hear this.

278
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:17,009
Forest life is his fate...

279
00:30:17,213 --> 00:30:20,649
Luxury is yours for nothing...

280
00:30:21,151 --> 00:30:22,641
Well said.

281
00:30:23,186 --> 00:30:24,585
Hail lord!

282
00:30:25,021 --> 00:30:29,651
Lord, you've a visitor.
- l don't have time.

283
00:30:30,126 --> 00:30:34,654
ln the battlefield as when
lotus attack is planned...

284
00:30:34,864 --> 00:30:39,597
He knows only to get into it...
You know to come out of it...

285
00:30:39,803 --> 00:30:40,667
Lord!

286
00:30:41,838 --> 00:30:43,203
Has he got your brain?

287
00:30:43,573 --> 00:30:44,904
Has he got your ease?

288
00:30:45,108 --> 00:30:46,769
Has he got your mastery of art?

289
00:30:46,976 --> 00:30:49,672
This is not to praise you...

290
00:30:51,347 --> 00:30:55,147
Lord, they praised and accepted gifts,

291
00:30:55,351 --> 00:30:58,878
they are nothing compared to me,

292
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:00,579
hear me now,

293
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,655
Two that side, two this side,

294
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:04,918
Abhimanyu's uncles,

295
00:31:05,128 --> 00:31:10,225
either from this side or that side,
just four only...

296
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,567
But for you !

297
00:31:11,768 --> 00:31:16,000
Just one less of hundred uncles.

298
00:31:16,206 --> 00:31:23,772
What an army of uncles you have!

299
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,244
Well said.

300
00:31:27,684 --> 00:31:29,811
Dear Lakshmana Kumara!

301
00:31:30,153 --> 00:31:33,645
Oh is it you? You all may leave now.

302
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:42,327
You look handsome.
You're a romantic hero.

303
00:31:42,699 --> 00:31:45,725
l'll tell you good news,
come sit here.

304
00:31:46,002 --> 00:31:48,334
lt's character of the brave
to listen standing.

305
00:31:48,705 --> 00:31:49,603
Tell me.

306
00:31:49,973 --> 00:31:53,909
Look, you're the Prince of
this vast kingdom.

307
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,270
That's all?

308
00:31:55,812 --> 00:31:58,645
Not just that, prince of princes.

309
00:31:58,848 --> 00:32:00,213
Young king!

310
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:01,974
Young emperor!

311
00:32:02,185 --> 00:32:07,817
Your father and l've decided
that you must marry now.

312
00:32:08,024 --> 00:32:09,616
Then l've also decided.

313
00:32:09,826 --> 00:32:13,023
Proposal is also from very good family.

314
00:32:13,229 --> 00:32:15,220
Bride is a world beauty.

315
00:32:15,431 --> 00:32:18,662
Sasirekha, Balarama's daughter.

316
00:32:18,868 --> 00:32:23,202
No way! How can l become son-in-law
to liege king of Yadavas.

317
00:32:23,406 --> 00:32:24,634
lmpossible.

318
00:32:25,675 --> 00:32:27,370
That's danger.

319
00:32:27,744 --> 00:32:30,304
lt seems Abhimanyu loves her.

320
00:32:31,014 --> 00:32:32,345
Can't l do it?

321
00:32:32,715 --> 00:32:35,081
l'll marry any girl Abhimanyu loves.

322
00:32:35,285 --> 00:32:37,253
l'll ensure he doesn't
find a girl to marry.

323
00:32:37,453 --> 00:32:39,648
Grandpa, l want Rekha.

324
00:32:39,956 --> 00:32:42,754
You're smart!
- Yes.

325
00:32:42,926 --> 00:32:45,622
Then l'll fix the marriage.
- Your wish.

326
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:01,942
Hail victory to you !

327
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,512
Epitome of truth !

328
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:06,582
Protector of the refuge seekers!

329
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:08,116
Generous man !

330
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,680
Saviour of the world!

331
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,083
Supreme lord of the world, Balarama!

332
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:15,483
Hail victory to you !

333
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:28,727
Has he got your brain?

334
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:32,201
Has he got your ease?

335
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,266
Has he got your mastery of art?

336
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:38,175
Who is it, Sarathy?
- You only!

337
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:41,010
l mean Abhimanyu.

338
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,711
Victory to you O mighty warrior!

339
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,817
Victory to you O romantic hero!

340
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:51,648
Stop your lullaby!
- Okay.

341
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:56,520
Lord come quickly and
seek blessings from Balarama.

342
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:58,855
Shame! Taking is seekers' character.

343
00:34:59,064 --> 00:35:01,225
Giving is regal character.
- So be it!

344
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,899
Lord, if you delay like this,
you may not get Sasirekha,

345
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,232
you promised to bow to
your future father-in-law.

346
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,633
Not bow, l promised only
to greet him.

347
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:15,711
How to do it?
- lt's simple, Lord.

348
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:18,815
Fold hands like this...
- Shame! That's your habit.

349
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:19,745
So be it.

350
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,044
Lord, l'll show you.

351
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:28,283
You saw Dharmaraju greeting
elders in the court,

352
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,094
you used to laugh jeeringly at him,

353
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,093
though little difficult
bend like this,

354
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:35,163
with profound humbleness,

355
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:38,597
like this like this...
that's all, my lord.

356
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,567
l can go down further, get up.

357
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:42,569
Come.

358
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:49,974
Game of dice was played with
Bheeshma, Drona, Vidhura's

359
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:52,240
permission and in their presence.

360
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:56,314
lf there had been any foul play,
would they keep quiet?

361
00:35:56,688 --> 00:36:01,591
Yes, winning in gamble is
as just as winning a war.

362
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:02,953
l too accept it.

363
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:06,688
Not only you, even Dharmaraju
himself accepted it.

364
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:11,733
But Bhima got furious and
made vows of destruction.

365
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:16,599
Uncle, don't talk about that blabber
and hurt his feelings.

366
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:19,333
Let him tell, shamelessly made vows too.

367
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:24,273
What did he say?
- What else? To kill everyone.

368
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,042
He promised to split open my chest.

369
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:28,344
He promised to drink my blood.
- What did l do?

370
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,211
Brother's order and
my duty to follow it. Draupadi...

371
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:33,982
Not just her relatives,

372
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:40,324
he told world is on his side and
Kauravas will get wiped out,

373
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,359
l couldn't bear to hear it and said,

374
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:46,636
Mighty warrior Balarama is on our side.

375
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:50,873
l'll break Duryodhana's thigh
as Balarama watches,

376
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:54,636
what can that old man do,
what can that Yadava do...

377
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:58,643
He's a rogue!
- He's responsible for this enmity.

378
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:02,786
lt's not a sin to kill him.
- Calm down.

379
00:37:04,022 --> 00:37:05,182
You're patriarch,

380
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,324
one who wishes good of everyone,

381
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:14,391
l told you to share my fear only.

382
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:18,862
Guru, l don't want all these
fears and jealous,

383
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:24,804
l'll give all that l won in
the game to you,

384
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:29,207
return the kingdom to them
and bring peace between us.

385
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:33,248
No need. lt's sin to give
who don't deserve it.

386
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:38,211
l'm granting you a boon
pleased with your conduct,

387
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:39,822
make your wish.

388
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:42,752
Lakshmana Kumara,
you came at the right time.

389
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:44,223
Come son !

390
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:53,293
Seek Guru's blessings.

391
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,369
May you get married soon !

392
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:01,940
Duryodhana, your son is ahead
of you in humbleness.

393
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:03,738
He respects elders.

394
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,711
Never raises head also
before his father.

395
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:07,782
He has great devotion for you.

396
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:13,052
That will bring laurels
to future kings.

397
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:14,725
Get up son !

398
00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:17,154
What do you want?

399
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:19,955
He has been yearning for many years,

400
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:23,792
She's doing penance to make
your daughter Sasi his queen.

401
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:29,898
Get up son.

402
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:41,343
Hail Lord Krishna! Hail Subhadra Devi!
Hail Abhimanyu !

403
00:38:46,224 --> 00:38:47,418
Welcome Subhadra.

404
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,190
May you be blessed with marriage.

405
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,891
Are the Pandavas doing fine, brother?

406
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:00,930
Great men are fine
wherever they are.

407
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,769
Are you fine, dear?

408
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:14,918
Sasi! Did you see he
has become Sathyavan?

409
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:23,492
lf he's Sathyavan,
then she's Savithri.

410
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,125
Our girl is no less.

411
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:31,460
Can't find sister-in-law?
ls she fine?

412
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:33,394
She belongs to olden times,

413
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:36,232
she's more sad than Pandavas
for losing kingdom.

414
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:41,572
Yes, if we are happy,
she will also be happy. Come in.

415
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:43,309
Come.

416
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:50,581
l felt pity on seeing Subhadra.

417
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:53,154
No grandeur of old times.

418
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:57,492
She came wearing jute sari
without any jewels.

419
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:01,024
As you sow so you reap.

420
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:01,994
What can we do?

421
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,169
Queen ! Subhadra Devi is coming.

422
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:07,932
Okay.

423
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:11,165
Bandage my head.

424
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:45,201
Come Subhadra!

425
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,308
Had a safe journey?

426
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:48,637
Please sit.

427
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:54,016
My bad time, l got headache
when you came.

428
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:55,977
l couldn't even receive you.

429
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:58,052
l wanted to meet you immediately,

430
00:40:58,256 --> 00:41:00,520
but brother Krishna and Rukmini
took me to their house.

431
00:41:00,892 --> 00:41:04,885
l don't mind which ever
house you go to.

432
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:08,893
Where ever we may be,
we don't lack any luxury.

433
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,465
You don't feel sad for it.

434
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:12,602
When is brother retuning?

435
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:13,994
How do l know?

436
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:16,605
Did he inform me before leaving
to inform his arrival?

437
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,271
He's short tempered man.

438
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:23,038
l'm scared that he may
pick up a fight there.

439
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:29,585
Sister-in-law, you're worrying
too much, take some rest.

440
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:31,682
l'll come after brother arrives.

441
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:52,939
ln the auspicious time
when our eyes met...

442
00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:59,549
Why are you worried?

443
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:07,122
You're as beautiful as
l had imagined...

444
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:24,971
ln the auspicious time
when our eyes met...

445
00:42:25,176 --> 00:42:31,672
Why are you spellbound?

446
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:39,114
Your dreams of meeting me
alone has come true...

447
00:43:03,648 --> 00:43:11,145
Songs and romance are charming
like songs of cuckoos...

448
00:43:20,498 --> 00:43:26,027
My love, you are work of art...

449
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:34,643
Your gentle movements are dances...

450
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:06,233
Fluently making repartees
like you sing...

451
00:44:19,357 --> 00:44:33,067
Showing your might on
your love in the garden...

452
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:48,448
Madam, your mother wants
to see you immediately.

453
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:53,556
Tomorrow is full moon day.

454
00:44:53,758 --> 00:44:55,783
Don't forget about boating.

455
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:10,798
What's it mother?

456
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:13,099
Are you having headache?

457
00:45:13,344 --> 00:45:15,312
lndeed your silly acts are
giving me headaches.

458
00:45:15,513 --> 00:45:18,209
Why were you dancing around
with him in the garden?

459
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:19,508
What's wrong if l play with him?

460
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,481
Are you both little children?

461
00:45:22,687 --> 00:45:23,654
You're young woman and
of marriageable age,

462
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:26,186
won't others laugh at us if you
roam with him before marriage?

463
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,789
Won't the elders of the
place find fault with it?

464
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:29,353
lt'll bring bad name too.

465
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,618
What do you want me to do then?

466
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:34,161
l'm telling you to stop
going out with Abhimanyu.

467
00:45:34,365 --> 00:45:36,299
lnfact don't even talk to him.

468
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,594
Follow my orders and be my daughter.
Understood?

469
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,692
What happened?

470
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:17,669
They say never go to parents' home
after getting ruined.

471
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:20,708
After seeing elder sister-in-law's
cold reception,

472
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,304
l'm rethinking,
why did l come here?

473
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:28,884
What's this? You know her attitude,
how can you think like this?

474
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:32,221
She'll change after
brother-in-law comes back.

475
00:46:32,423 --> 00:46:35,483
Come, your brother is waiting for you.

476
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:50,236
This one jewel will cost 10 lakhs.

477
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:52,266
lf l've to value all these...

478
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:53,841
What's there in the value?

479
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:57,414
This is Duryodhana's devotion on me.

480
00:46:57,681 --> 00:47:01,412
He gave me a rousing reception
and felicitated me.

481
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:03,987
l granted him a boon
pleased with his devotion.

482
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:05,982
What did he wish for?
What did you grant?

483
00:47:06,357 --> 00:47:07,722
Please tell me also.

484
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:09,552
How can l not tell you?

485
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,228
He asked to make Queen Revathi's daughter,

486
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:16,729
as the queen of future
king Lakshmana Kumara,

487
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:18,299
l said yes.

488
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:23,297
But l'm worried about Subhadra.
- She will feel.

489
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,907
Can we send our daughter
to forest for her sake?

490
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:28,336
Our daughter is really lucky,

491
00:47:28,546 --> 00:47:30,980
they made a request and
you promised them.

492
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,872
Burden on my heart has eased.

493
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:36,951
Till marriage date is fixed,
keep it between us.

494
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:38,788
Why?
- You don't know anything,

495
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:41,287
Subhadra will create a scene
if she comes to know.

496
00:47:41,492 --> 00:47:42,789
Okay.

497
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:44,821
Come dear...come.

498
00:47:46,497 --> 00:47:47,794
Come dear...come.

499
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:52,457
Look, these gifts were sent
to you by Bhanumathi.

500
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:55,036
l don't want it, father.
- Don't say like that, accept it.

501
00:47:55,406 --> 00:47:57,670
Will you say no to gifts sent
by Queen Bhanumathi?

502
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,740
Who is she to send me gifts?

503
00:47:59,944 --> 00:48:01,912
Who am l to her to accept the gifts?
- Did you see her hot temper?

504
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:04,910
What's this dear?
They are also our well wishers.

505
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:07,982
How can they be, father?
Anyway l'll not accept it.

506
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:10,916
You keep quiet,
l'll cure that madness.

507
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:23,925
What's that arrogance?
Will you walk out on your father?

508
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:28,935
When Kaurava King sends gifts to you,
will you belittle it?

509
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:30,663
l didn't belittle them.

510
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:35,938
Those evil people sent gifts
to insult you, me and all of us.

511
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:39,047
What? Who taught all these bad ideas?

512
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,941
Rukmini and Subhadra?
l don't like all this.

513
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:44,882
Don't ever go to their home again,
don't even talk to them.

514
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:46,852
You're my daughter,
you know that?

515
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:49,685
You must obey me only.
Be careful.

516
00:49:27,539 --> 00:49:30,599
What are you waiting for?
Come quickly.

517
00:49:55,601 --> 00:49:58,502
Door is locked,
how am l to come out?

518
00:49:59,605 --> 00:50:01,573
Jump! l'll catch you.

519
00:50:06,078 --> 00:50:09,013
How am l to come up again?

520
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:16,654
l'll make a ladder with arrows,
get down.

521
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:48,678
ln the intoxication...

522
00:51:48,881 --> 00:51:57,118
The world is stumbling
and fumbling...

523
00:52:00,893 --> 00:52:04,727
ln the intoxication...

524
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:12,962
The world is stumbling
and fumbling...

525
00:52:28,921 --> 00:52:34,655
ln the company of
graceful stars and moon...

526
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:38,660
With pervading soft moonlight...

527
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:41,094
With great speed...

528
00:52:48,907 --> 00:52:57,110
ln the caressing gentle breeze
filled with fragrance of love flowers...

529
00:53:24,977 --> 00:53:30,711
Sweet memories are
incited by dreams...

530
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:34,443
Passions are charged up...

531
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:37,152
ln this shine...

532
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:52,898
ln this enchanting ride
in the boat of love...

533
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:22,865
Come.- Where to?
- l'll tell you.

534
00:54:24,069 --> 00:54:25,093
Come.

535
00:54:31,009 --> 00:54:36,106
Lord! Princess Sasirekha and
Abhimanyu are riding in a boat.

536
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:38,909
How did she go out?
Come.

537
00:54:52,264 --> 00:54:57,930
Making this romantic world
to pitch for love play...

538
00:54:58,136 --> 00:55:04,371
This pleasant sweetness
of love is prompting...

539
00:55:11,917 --> 00:55:15,478
Bringing peace to everyone's
agitated heart...

540
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:19,483
With the lovely pranks of
the mischievous lord...

541
00:56:12,344 --> 00:56:15,507
Poor soldiers! They mistook them
for our children.

542
00:56:15,881 --> 00:56:17,246
Wonder of modern times!

543
00:56:17,449 --> 00:56:20,418
What's these late night boat rides
for Rukmini at this age?

544
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:29,657
ln this moonlit night,
with cool gentle breeze blowing.

545
00:56:30,295 --> 00:56:34,561
anyway we have come so far,
let's also go for a boat ride.

546
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:36,025
Come.

547
00:57:03,728 --> 00:57:05,161
Wonder of modern times!

548
00:57:05,363 --> 00:57:08,594
What's these late night boat rides
for Revathi at this age?

549
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,264
Love has no logic!

550
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:41,229
Hail the mighty majestic
his royal highness Lord Balarama!

551
00:57:41,433 --> 00:57:44,300
Stop!
l'll get you gifts.

552
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:46,971
Praising me coming to my place.

553
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:49,970
Then what?
You're the supreme lord!

554
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:53,372
Yes...but l didn't expect you so early.

555
00:57:53,578 --> 00:57:54,977
Why should you think, brother?

556
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:58,240
You're kind hearted boon giver,
don't know what boon you granted them.

557
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:01,317
May be he's here to remind you,
lest you may forget it.

558
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,317
Why should l remind him?

559
00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:05,990
The moment he granted the boon
we were blessed.

560
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:08,682
Yes...great men don't come
for nothing.

561
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:13,656
Whatever it is, l'll not tolerate if
he plays game of dice with you.

562
00:58:14,065 --> 00:58:15,532
Why are you so scared, Krishna?

563
00:58:15,734 --> 00:58:18,498
Even if we play,
your brother will only win.

564
00:58:19,404 --> 00:58:20,564
He's epitome of honesty.

565
00:58:20,772 --> 00:58:25,175
But if it is proved you're dishonest,
you'll have trouble from him.

566
00:58:26,011 --> 00:58:30,004
lt's good for you to be careful.
Though younger l'm warning you.

567
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:34,478
Did you see how Krishna
is threatening with word play?

568
00:58:34,686 --> 00:58:40,682
No, whenever he meets intelligent
men like you, he gets little shaken up.

569
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:42,026
Welcome.

570
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,452
Welcome.

571
00:58:45,263 --> 00:58:50,166
This auspicious time is fixed according
Lakshmana Kumar's horoscope.

572
00:58:50,535 --> 00:58:56,030
Marriage of Sasirekha will be an event
that world will remember for long time.

573
00:58:56,241 --> 00:59:00,143
Power of the auspicious time
is very strong.

574
00:59:00,345 --> 00:59:03,041
You've decided the auspicious time also.

575
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:06,308
What else?
As soon as you said okay,

576
00:59:06,518 --> 00:59:10,716
Bheeshma, Drona and Vidhura
wanted to happen at the earliest,

577
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:13,216
they fixed this date
and time of marriage.

578
00:59:14,659 --> 00:59:19,494
lf elders had fixed this,
l'm sure it'll be very important.

579
00:59:21,066 --> 00:59:25,059
Why are you thinking, brother?
Go ahead.- So be it.

580
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:30,469
l think our priests are
checking the fixed time.

581
00:59:30,675 --> 00:59:34,076
Wow! Great astrologers!

582
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:44,082
There's nothing to think
about this auspicious time.

583
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:46,257
No need to doubt it.

584
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:51,486
Checking planetary movements
according to the bride's horoscope.

585
00:59:51,696 --> 00:59:58,295
Shukracharya, the guru of demons
is casting a bad eye.

586
00:59:58,503 --> 01:00:03,099
This may create problems and
difficulties in the lives of the newly weds.

587
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:09,611
Yes, astrology always says
right and bitter truths only.

588
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:14,274
We must take only
the gist of it lightly.

589
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:20,322
You've to take problem here
as love problem.

590
01:00:20,525 --> 01:00:26,259
Difficulties here mean
many children.

591
01:00:26,564 --> 01:00:29,533
But this is bad time.

592
01:00:29,734 --> 01:00:33,192
Astrology says marriage
in these times is impossible.

593
01:00:33,405 --> 01:00:37,774
You need to be presented
for your scholarliness.

594
01:00:38,143 --> 01:00:40,668
But your astrology works
for ordinary people only,

595
01:00:40,879 --> 01:00:44,508
not for Kauravas who are
brilliant and fortunate men.

596
01:00:44,716 --> 01:00:49,813
May be but when Saturn is
in this room...

597
01:00:50,622 --> 01:00:54,524
Our Shakuni who is equal
to a lakh Saturns is here,

598
01:00:54,726 --> 01:00:56,489
so why bother in which
room the Saturn is?

599
01:00:56,695 --> 01:01:00,222
Accept it. lt's their tradition.

600
01:01:01,399 --> 01:01:05,699
Brother, their haste is ours too.

601
01:01:05,904 --> 01:01:08,839
l too agree for this proposal
and the time fixed by them.

602
01:01:09,574 --> 01:01:11,838
Only if you think we don't
have much time.

603
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:17,848
When you take the responsibility
of conducting it,

604
01:01:18,283 --> 01:01:22,276
time will never run short.
l don't have that fear.

605
01:01:26,591 --> 01:01:30,789
ls it justice to break promise of
making Sasi my daughter-in-law?

606
01:01:30,995 --> 01:01:35,159
ls it breaking a promise?
He told it just like that to his sister.

607
01:01:35,366 --> 01:01:38,824
Will it be same as granting a
boon to Duryodhana in his court?

608
01:01:39,204 --> 01:01:43,265
Not only that, you're becoming
kinsman of our enemies.

609
01:01:43,608 --> 01:01:45,974
Did you think it's a great insult to me?

610
01:01:46,478 --> 01:01:50,244
How my husband his brothers
look down upon me?

611
01:01:50,448 --> 01:01:52,973
lf you think like that,
then don't go there at all.

612
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:55,382
There's nothing short
in your respect here.

613
01:01:55,587 --> 01:01:59,489
Enough of your respect for me,
l'm telling you the last time,

614
01:01:59,691 --> 01:02:00,715
if Sasi doesn't become
my daughter-in-law,

615
01:02:00,925 --> 01:02:02,415
l'll not stay here even
for a moment.

616
01:02:02,627 --> 01:02:04,322
ls that a threat?

617
01:02:04,529 --> 01:02:08,727
Do you want my daughter also
to be in parents' home like you?

618
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:15,236
Sister, leave about Subhadra.
Think about our daughter.

619
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,874
We filled her thoughts
since childhood.

620
01:02:18,243 --> 01:02:21,872
Sasi hopes that Abhimanyu will
become her husband.

621
01:02:22,247 --> 01:02:24,875
lf you marry her to someone else,
what will become of her life?

622
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:27,411
Do you know about a daughter
more than me?

623
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:28,950
You would know had you
given birth to a daughter.

624
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:30,344
Would you say these morals then?

625
01:02:30,555 --> 01:02:32,580
Revathi, keep quiet.

626
01:02:32,891 --> 01:02:36,793
Whatever it is, marriage must
go on as scheduled.

627
01:02:36,995 --> 01:02:39,657
l don't want anyone
to stop or threaten me.

628
01:02:39,864 --> 01:02:41,422
Surely you do, brother.

629
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:44,329
You're spoiling two young
people's lives wantonly.

630
01:02:44,536 --> 01:02:46,595
l didn't think you'll be
so obstinate.

631
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:49,638
Will my cries go waste?

632
01:02:49,841 --> 01:02:53,777
May be you think wealth of Kauravas
is greater than courage of Pandavas.

633
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:54,967
lt will never be.

634
01:02:55,346 --> 01:02:58,338
Are you threatening me
with their bravery?

635
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:03,784
Their bravery doesn't need me,
my disciple Duryodhana is enough.

636
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:07,947
Even 1000 Bhimas & 1000 Arjunas
are nothing compared to him.

637
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:14,287
Uncle, mind your tongue.
l'm here though my father is not.

638
01:03:14,566 --> 01:03:16,864
What will you do?
- What will l do?

639
01:03:17,068 --> 01:03:21,471
Will you bring bad name to me
by going against your uncle?

640
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:25,632
This is not rebelling against but
standing bravely on my ground.

641
01:03:26,544 --> 01:03:30,002
Uncle, if Kauravas are
as brave as you say,

642
01:03:30,381 --> 01:03:32,849
tell them to come along
with Lakshmana Kumara,

643
01:03:33,051 --> 01:03:35,383
l'll drive out Duryodhana,
Dushyasana, Karna and Shakuni,

644
01:03:35,587 --> 01:03:39,023
and their armies to Hastinapuram,

645
01:03:39,390 --> 01:03:42,018
l'll take Sasi as my wife
in open competition.

646
01:03:42,393 --> 01:03:43,690
lf you and your friends
have the courage,

647
01:03:43,895 --> 01:03:45,328
announce an open challenge
of fight to marry her.

648
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,555
You'll know who Sasi
belongs to, me or them.

649
01:03:47,765 --> 01:03:50,825
Why are you throwing challenges?

650
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:53,367
lf you were really a brave man,

651
01:03:53,571 --> 01:03:58,008
would you stand here and
throw challenges?

652
01:04:04,415 --> 01:04:08,442
You're wife of great warrior,
mother of a great warrior,

653
01:04:08,653 --> 01:04:10,484
l didn't expect you to be so weak.

654
01:04:11,456 --> 01:04:15,017
You know brother's idea,
why are you making a scene here?

655
01:04:15,593 --> 01:04:17,925
There are no ears here
to listen to your appeals.

656
01:04:18,596 --> 01:04:20,461
You can go wherever you feel like.

657
01:04:21,032 --> 01:04:22,693
l'll go as you say.

658
01:04:23,902 --> 01:04:31,365
l'll come back only when you
honour bravery and not wealth.

659
01:04:32,977 --> 01:04:35,104
Aunt!

660
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:37,448
Where are you going, Sasi?

661
01:04:37,715 --> 01:04:40,081
l'll also go with aunt.
- When l'm still alive?

662
01:04:40,451 --> 01:04:42,578
Don't get smart with me.
Come.

663
01:04:42,787 --> 01:04:45,517
Aunt.
- What's this?

664
01:05:00,471 --> 01:05:02,871
Subhadra and Abhimanyu
are leaving to Dwaithavanam,

665
01:05:03,074 --> 01:05:06,805
without informing them,
take them to Ghatotkacha's ashram.

666
01:05:07,011 --> 01:05:08,069
That's all.

667
01:06:05,938 --> 01:06:06,870
Present sir!

668
01:06:07,106 --> 01:06:08,198
Present sir!

669
01:06:09,742 --> 01:06:10,538
Present sir!

670
01:06:11,076 --> 01:06:12,043
Present sir!

671
01:06:13,078 --> 01:06:14,545
Present sir!

672
01:06:15,247 --> 01:06:16,612
Present sir!

673
01:06:17,082 --> 01:06:18,208
Present sir!

674
01:06:24,089 --> 01:06:24,783
Present sir!

675
01:06:24,990 --> 01:06:26,048
Present sir!

676
01:06:30,329 --> 01:06:34,231
lf you study well as l instruct,
l'll clear your language difficulties.

677
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:38,559
lf not Ghatotkacha will come
and thrash you.

678
01:06:44,777 --> 01:06:49,737
Hail Leader!

679
01:06:49,982 --> 01:06:58,651
My flag must flutter on all
eight directions...

680
01:06:58,857 --> 01:07:07,094
Every demon, devil, elf on earth
must worship me...

681
01:07:07,299 --> 01:07:16,606
Wherever the place be,
wonders must happen on my orders only...

682
01:07:16,809 --> 01:07:26,616
Even Gods and angels must say,
Hail Ghatotkacha!

683
01:07:26,819 --> 01:07:30,653
l must rule this world...

684
01:07:30,856 --> 01:07:34,815
l must acquire all the wealth...

685
01:07:35,027 --> 01:07:45,130
l must get everlasting name for
making relatives achieve greatness...

686
01:07:49,174 --> 01:07:54,305
Hail Leader!

687
01:07:55,647 --> 01:07:58,207
Now they don't need this
education any more,

688
01:07:58,417 --> 01:08:00,248
they must learn the history and
get knowledge of friends and enemies.

689
01:08:00,452 --> 01:08:02,977
Protect friends and eat enemies.

690
01:08:03,188 --> 01:08:05,383
Hail Leader!

691
01:08:05,758 --> 01:08:08,659
Eat!
- We'll eat enemies.

692
01:08:08,861 --> 01:08:10,226
Son !

693
01:08:12,765 --> 01:08:14,392
Son ! Son !
- Mother!

694
01:08:14,767 --> 01:08:17,668
l told you not to do this,
whom are you attacking now?

695
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:21,271
War is not now, l'm just
preparing for it, mother.

696
01:08:21,473 --> 01:08:25,000
King Bhimasena is your husband,
my father,

697
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:30,910
mother, l'm preparing army
to wipe out those evil Kauravas.

698
01:08:31,116 --> 01:08:35,314
That's a good deed, my son.
- Hail mother!

699
01:08:35,687 --> 01:08:36,676
Yes sir!

700
01:08:37,022 --> 01:08:37,852
Yes sir!

701
01:08:38,056 --> 01:08:39,956
Our army must grow with
every passing day.

702
01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:42,855
Hail Leader!

703
01:08:43,228 --> 01:08:46,095
My dear men,
develop an army of your own.

704
01:08:46,298 --> 01:08:48,198
Every man you see,
make him our man.

705
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:51,369
Hail Leader!

706
01:08:58,911 --> 01:09:03,211
Who is this charioteer
who dared to enter my area?

707
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:06,439
Hail Leader!

708
01:09:06,819 --> 01:09:07,410
Who is he?

709
01:09:07,786 --> 01:09:10,050
Make him say his name
and ask him to seek refuge.

710
01:09:10,255 --> 01:09:11,222
Hail Leader!

711
01:09:11,423 --> 01:09:14,221
Man who seeks refuge
with me is my man. Go!

712
01:09:29,141 --> 01:09:35,740
Go back!

713
01:09:36,548 --> 01:09:40,245
What are these screams?
Can't see anyone?

714
01:09:48,126 --> 01:09:49,423
Can't see anyone?

715
01:09:56,835 --> 01:09:58,302
Looks like magic world of demons!

716
01:09:58,503 --> 01:10:00,368
We haven't taken the
wrong route, have we?

717
01:10:00,572 --> 01:10:02,733
This is right way,
entered it knowingly,

718
01:10:02,941 --> 01:10:04,465
shall l turn back?

719
01:10:04,843 --> 01:10:07,903
Turning back is something l don't know.
Go ahead.

720
01:10:13,852 --> 01:10:15,479
Why are you screaming invisibly?

721
01:10:15,854 --> 01:10:19,381
lf you've guts, appear before me,
l'll destroy your magic.

722
01:10:26,031 --> 01:10:31,401
What's this? His magic is scary!
- Don't fear, keep going.

723
01:10:35,507 --> 01:10:39,568
Hey lllusionist!
My arrow will kill you !

724
01:10:42,848 --> 01:10:46,807
Victory is yours!

725
01:10:47,886 --> 01:10:49,820
Carry on.

726
01:11:06,505 --> 01:11:07,836
Yes sir.

727
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:13,239
Pandavas are friends.
lt means our people.

728
01:11:13,445 --> 01:11:14,343
Repeat now.

729
01:11:14,546 --> 01:11:17,037
Pandavas are f-r-i-e-n-d-s!

730
01:11:17,249 --> 01:11:19,945
Not f-r-i-e-n-d-s, say friends!

731
01:11:20,152 --> 01:11:22,916
Say f-r-i-e-n-d-s! Not friends.

732
01:11:23,121 --> 01:11:26,090
King, he's teaching me now!
Ask him to say friends.

733
01:11:26,291 --> 01:11:29,488
Why? We'll know our people
with that word, king.

734
01:11:29,861 --> 01:11:30,850
Enough !

735
01:11:31,063 --> 01:11:33,827
Knowledge is more important
than scholarliness.

736
01:11:34,032 --> 01:11:35,363
Present him rope award!

737
01:11:36,068 --> 01:11:37,035
Put!

738
01:11:40,072 --> 01:11:45,135
Pandavas are friends, what do you
call their enemies Kauravas?

739
01:11:45,344 --> 01:11:49,280
Foes!

740
01:11:49,481 --> 01:11:51,142
You and your brain !

741
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:54,581
Lord, he has produced a new word foe
as antonym of friend.

742
01:11:54,953 --> 01:11:57,478
Yes, how words develop
without anyone producing it.

743
01:11:57,689 --> 01:12:01,386
Award him with two!
- Two? Okay put!

744
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:14,903
Teach them what you call Duryodhana,
Dushyasana, Karna and Shakuni together.

745
01:12:15,107 --> 01:12:19,567
Bad quartet! Repeat!

746
01:12:23,281 --> 01:12:26,079
Carry on ! Bad quartet!

747
01:12:26,284 --> 01:12:27,945
B-a-d q-u-a-r-t-e-t!

748
01:12:28,153 --> 01:12:30,212
B-a-d q-u-a-r-t-e-t!

749
01:12:30,422 --> 01:12:33,118
Oh God!

750
01:12:33,325 --> 01:12:36,920
Oh God!

751
01:12:37,562 --> 01:12:40,292
lt's wrong to split a word.
- Why is it wrong?

752
01:12:40,499 --> 01:12:45,436
We must split and kill those
quartet like they pronounce.

753
01:12:46,204 --> 01:12:48,263
B-a-d q-u-a-r-t-e-t!

754
01:12:49,975 --> 01:12:51,442
Leader!

755
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:57,107
Who did it?
- A human !

756
01:12:57,516 --> 01:12:59,609
He busted me.

757
01:13:00,252 --> 01:13:02,516
He's young and adventurous.

758
01:13:03,055 --> 01:13:05,080
Human? A young man?

759
01:13:05,290 --> 01:13:07,190
Surprize!

760
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:09,084
Hail leader!

761
01:13:09,394 --> 01:13:09,951
Hail leader!

762
01:13:10,162 --> 01:13:13,290
l can't tolerate any more,
finish him with your magical powers.

763
01:13:13,498 --> 01:13:17,958
We'll finish him...
- And bring him to you.- Go!

764
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:19,468
Wait!

765
01:13:21,273 --> 01:13:25,232
l feel like seeing the young warrior.
Bring him alive.

766
01:13:27,345 --> 01:13:28,312
Go!

767
01:13:56,007 --> 01:13:58,134
l'll spread from that side,
you spread from that side.

768
01:14:12,224 --> 01:14:14,021
What's this danger?

769
01:14:15,827 --> 01:14:18,523
Forest fire!
lt's coming fast towards us!

770
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:28,361
Go back!

771
01:14:28,573 --> 01:14:31,371
Looks like it's illusion !

772
01:14:46,458 --> 01:14:50,053
How to escape from it?
- This is wind missile!

773
01:15:22,327 --> 01:15:24,625
Hail hero! l appreciate you !

774
01:15:24,829 --> 01:15:29,596
Your courage has moved me.
You are handsome.

775
01:15:29,801 --> 01:15:36,639
Atlast you've come face to face,
l'm also very happy. Come.

776
01:15:36,841 --> 01:15:40,675
Hey boy! Your innocent face is
cooling my anger.

777
01:15:40,879 --> 01:15:42,813
You can't fight me.

778
01:15:43,181 --> 01:15:46,275
Tell your name and seek refuge,
you'll become my man.

779
01:15:46,918 --> 01:15:50,149
Are you a warrior who insists
on seeking refuge?

780
01:15:50,355 --> 01:15:52,721
l'll make you seek refuge.
Watch out!

781
01:15:57,128 --> 01:15:58,789
You really hurt me!

782
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:05,260
But l don't feel like
hitting back, boy!

783
01:16:06,137 --> 01:16:09,265
Don't say feel, say can't.

784
01:16:09,541 --> 01:16:13,204
No use of calling me boy
and become elder,

785
01:16:13,411 --> 01:16:15,276
show me your power.

786
01:16:19,317 --> 01:16:24,721
Though you're teasing me,
l feel only pity not angry on you.

787
01:16:24,923 --> 01:16:30,259
Mother, ask your son to tell
his name and save his life.

788
01:16:30,462 --> 01:16:34,364
Son ! Tell him your name.
- lmpossible!

789
01:16:34,566 --> 01:16:36,227
Getting scared of enemy
and tell my name, no way.

790
01:16:36,434 --> 01:16:37,628
Hey demon king!

791
01:16:37,836 --> 01:16:40,430
Unable to win over me,
you've made this evil proposal.

792
01:16:40,639 --> 01:16:42,664
You're cunning, you're a coward,

793
01:16:42,874 --> 01:16:44,671
you don't have any pride.

794
01:16:44,876 --> 01:16:47,208
Hey! What's your arrogance?

795
01:16:47,412 --> 01:16:51,610
Trying to test my power
and go against me. Watch out!

796
01:16:57,222 --> 01:16:59,622
Oh ! He made our leader lose his mace.

797
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:02,691
Surprize!

798
01:19:24,506 --> 01:19:26,736
Son !
- He's just unconscious.

799
01:19:26,942 --> 01:19:30,070
Ensure the demon not attacks again
before he regains conscious.

800
01:19:34,950 --> 01:19:43,085
l'm Lord Krishna's sister who
rules over heaven and hell...

801
01:19:45,193 --> 01:19:52,565
l'm Arjuna's wife who is
the mightiest warrior...

802
01:19:54,169 --> 01:20:03,942
May this arrow kill the enemy
and protect the heir of Pandavas...

803
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:06,580
Forgive me mother, l seek your refuge.

804
01:20:07,516 --> 01:20:09,006
lt's an unwittingly committed mistake.

805
01:20:09,217 --> 01:20:11,685
Please forgive me, mother.
lt's an unwittingly committed mistake.

806
01:20:11,887 --> 01:20:15,482
l'm Bhimasena's son Ghatotkacha.
- ls it?

807
01:20:15,691 --> 01:20:16,453
Yes mother.

808
01:20:16,658 --> 01:20:19,218
lt's an unwittingly committed mistake.
Please forgive me.

809
01:20:21,763 --> 01:20:23,856
Hey demon ! Wherever you may be...

810
01:20:24,066 --> 01:20:26,626
Victory be yours brother!

811
01:20:26,835 --> 01:20:29,099
l'm here only under the
protection of mother.

812
01:20:29,471 --> 01:20:32,963
Son, he's your elder brother
Ghatotkacha.

813
01:20:33,675 --> 01:20:36,473
Hi elder brother!
- Hi younger brother!

814
01:20:40,048 --> 01:20:41,982
Surprize!

815
01:20:44,553 --> 01:20:46,487
Happy, l'm extremely happy, mother.

816
01:20:46,688 --> 01:20:48,849
You've made a rare visit to us.
Got you at last.

817
01:20:49,057 --> 01:20:50,718
l'll not leave you.

818
01:20:50,926 --> 01:20:54,987
Son, l told you no to war.
What's this commotion?

819
01:20:55,197 --> 01:20:57,165
Who are these humans?
Why are you arresting them?

820
01:20:57,532 --> 01:21:00,160
Not arresting but hosting, mother.

821
01:21:00,569 --> 01:21:01,866
Do you know who is she?

822
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:06,734
She's queen of uncle Arjuna!
Subhadra Devi!

823
01:21:06,942 --> 01:21:09,775
Sister Hidambi.
- May God bless you.

824
01:21:09,978 --> 01:21:13,675
l'm seeing you for the first time.
ls he your son?

825
01:21:13,882 --> 01:21:15,543
Yes mother.

826
01:21:15,751 --> 01:21:17,116
God bless you son.

827
01:21:17,319 --> 01:21:18,843
God bless you.

828
01:21:19,554 --> 01:21:20,521
Hail leader!

829
01:21:20,722 --> 01:21:21,620
Hail leader!

830
01:21:21,823 --> 01:21:23,188
Friends!

831
01:21:23,558 --> 01:21:25,583
F-r-i-e-n-d-s!

832
01:21:25,794 --> 01:21:27,193
Bow to them!

833
01:21:30,799 --> 01:21:32,198
F-r-i-e-n-d-s!

834
01:21:32,868 --> 01:21:37,032
l'll take leave now, Subhadra Devi.
- Bye!

835
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:38,972
Hail leader!

836
01:21:39,174 --> 01:21:40,038
Hail leader!

837
01:21:40,242 --> 01:21:42,039
Friends must be given a grand reception.

838
01:21:42,344 --> 01:21:45,211
Arrange song, dance and music!

839
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:46,672
Come...come.

840
01:21:47,315 --> 01:21:48,304
Mother...

841
01:21:50,051 --> 01:21:51,040
Brother...

842
01:21:58,992 --> 01:22:05,056
Elders...elders...why should
we take trouble with us?

843
01:22:05,265 --> 01:22:09,031
Drona, Ashwathama and Kripacharya
are not even our relatives.

844
01:22:09,236 --> 01:22:10,931
l struck off their names.

845
01:22:11,137 --> 01:22:14,800
Bheeshma & Vidhura are our grandfathers,
we all are their lineage,

846
01:22:15,008 --> 01:22:17,806
Krishna will purposely ask
why haven't they come?

847
01:22:18,178 --> 01:22:20,146
What will be your reply, uncle?

848
01:22:20,347 --> 01:22:23,805
What am l to say?
They are still on Pandavas side.

849
01:22:24,017 --> 01:22:28,215
So, let's say old men are
paralyzed or can't move.

850
01:22:28,421 --> 01:22:31,322
Well said, Karna.
l struck off the oldies too.

851
01:22:32,859 --> 01:22:37,023
lf we strike off all the names
and we four only go there,

852
01:22:37,230 --> 01:22:39,289
will it be grand fitting my status?

853
01:22:39,666 --> 01:22:44,660
Not just we four,
you and your 99 brothers,

854
01:22:44,871 --> 01:22:48,272
hundred brothers are enough,
it will be very grand,

855
01:22:48,475 --> 01:22:50,340
and we would've kept our word.

856
01:22:50,710 --> 01:22:53,008
Wow uncle! Our immediate duty?

857
01:22:53,213 --> 01:22:54,874
Travel preparations.

858
01:22:55,081 --> 01:22:57,208
Hail lord!

859
01:22:57,417 --> 01:23:01,820
Grandfather must come
immediately to Lakshmana's room.

860
01:23:02,022 --> 01:23:06,356
Go immediately,
he may've created a new problem.

861
01:23:06,726 --> 01:23:10,253
No need, he himself is here.
Come son.

862
01:23:14,801 --> 01:23:16,359
Character of youth !

863
01:23:16,870 --> 01:23:20,397
As soon as marriage is fixed,
you feel like meeting people.

864
01:23:20,774 --> 01:23:22,935
Yes grandpa, l don't have stage fear.

865
01:23:23,143 --> 01:23:25,236
l can speak in public,
that's why l'm here.

866
01:23:25,445 --> 01:23:27,037
l'll not marry now.

867
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:28,247
Yes, father.

868
01:23:28,448 --> 01:23:31,884
lt's not bravery to marry
without seeing the bride.

869
01:23:32,085 --> 01:23:35,077
l was expecting this, Duryodhana.

870
01:23:35,288 --> 01:23:38,917
Our boy forgot about this
respecting our decision.

871
01:23:39,125 --> 01:23:40,888
Yes, now l remembered it.

872
01:23:41,094 --> 01:23:45,758
Princes like you must go
and see any girl,

873
01:23:45,965 --> 01:23:49,401
if you like even if Gods stop you,
win over them to take the girl,

874
01:23:49,769 --> 01:23:50,326
lndeed.

875
01:23:50,537 --> 01:23:53,768
Abhimanyu may hesitate not you.

876
01:23:53,973 --> 01:23:56,237
Let's go to Dwaraka immediately,

877
01:23:56,443 --> 01:24:00,937
on reaching the guest house,
l'll call the bride, you can meet her.

878
01:24:01,147 --> 01:24:03,081
l'm sure you will like her.

879
01:24:03,283 --> 01:24:05,843
Even if l don't like l must meet
the bride before marriage,

880
01:24:06,052 --> 01:24:07,417
that's a vow!

881
01:24:07,821 --> 01:24:12,258
So be it son, get ready to travel.
- l'm ready to travel.

882
01:24:21,868 --> 01:24:24,268
lt's me! Open the door.

883
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:27,030
They wanted to make you bride,

884
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:29,731
why did you sent them out
and closed the door?

885
01:24:29,943 --> 01:24:30,910
Why don't you talk to me?

886
01:24:31,578 --> 01:24:32,772
Open the door.

887
01:24:33,146 --> 01:24:36,741
How many times do l've to tell you?
l don't like this marriage.

888
01:24:39,452 --> 01:24:42,080
No more it's in our hands now,

889
01:24:42,288 --> 01:24:44,222
don't think your protests
will stop this marriage,

890
01:24:44,424 --> 01:24:45,857
groom's people are coming,

891
01:24:46,059 --> 01:24:50,792
your objections will not be accepted,
be careful, get through it happily.

892
01:24:52,599 --> 01:24:53,122
Happily?

893
01:24:53,333 --> 01:24:56,393
You dashed my hopes,
you broke my heart,

894
01:24:56,603 --> 01:25:00,130
you spoilt my mind,
infact l don't want to live at all.

895
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:02,808
What are you saying, Sasi?

896
01:25:03,009 --> 01:25:03,907
What happened, sister?

897
01:25:04,110 --> 01:25:06,874
What could it be? The idea you put
into her since childhood,

898
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:08,479
it's now taking toll on me.

899
01:25:08,848 --> 01:25:11,078
Don't get angry, sister-in-law.
Little girl.

900
01:25:11,284 --> 01:25:15,015
Give her little time to calm down.

901
01:25:15,221 --> 01:25:18,952
By tomorrow you will her
fine and enthusiastic.

902
01:25:19,159 --> 01:25:22,560
l'm brave because you're here
to manage things.

903
01:25:22,929 --> 01:25:26,956
lt's your responsibility to conduct
this marriage without any hitch.

904
01:25:33,606 --> 01:25:36,837
What is this, Sasi?

905
01:25:40,647 --> 01:25:43,377
You will know it tomorrow.

906
01:26:12,912 --> 01:26:17,406
l'm living for you only...

907
01:26:17,617 --> 01:26:22,884
This sorrow of separation
is very depressing...

908
01:26:32,332 --> 01:26:37,133
Even if moonlight turns dark...

909
01:26:37,337 --> 01:26:42,570
Though heart plunges into darkness...

910
01:27:02,161 --> 01:27:06,621
lsn't separation of sorrow
also comfort?

911
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:11,937
lsn't thinking of love
always very sweet?

912
01:27:21,314 --> 01:27:31,121
Can't you see love getting
stronger in separation?

913
01:27:31,324 --> 01:27:35,988
l'm thinking about you only...

914
01:27:36,195 --> 01:27:41,098
ln my heart and mind...

915
01:27:58,551 --> 01:28:03,181
Though my heart leaves with you...

916
01:28:03,389 --> 01:28:09,123
Though wishes in heart vanish...

917
01:28:10,730 --> 01:28:21,004
Thinking about our love...
holding on to this life...

918
01:28:38,091 --> 01:28:48,524
ln reality or in dream,
l worship you as my lady love...

919
01:28:50,470 --> 01:29:05,181
Though this entire world turns
against me, you're mine...

920
01:29:20,633 --> 01:29:22,567
What?

921
01:29:23,269 --> 01:29:25,203
Did he promise Sasi to Abhimanyu?

922
01:29:25,405 --> 01:29:30,604
ls he breaking it and getting
her married to Duryodhana's son?

923
01:29:30,810 --> 01:29:32,744
How could your own
brother Balarama insult you?

924
01:29:33,112 --> 01:29:36,479
What can we do now, sister?
We are poor now.

925
01:29:36,683 --> 01:29:39,846
Lost only wealth not courage.

926
01:29:40,319 --> 01:29:43,447
People who worship money
won't see courage.

927
01:29:43,656 --> 01:29:48,719
More over he said Pandavas are
nothing compared to Kauravas.

928
01:29:49,095 --> 01:29:52,223
Blow the war bugle!

929
01:29:53,599 --> 01:29:55,191
Looks like son has heard us.

930
01:29:55,401 --> 01:29:58,564
Son...son...

931
01:29:58,771 --> 01:30:02,673
My dear men, get ready with
your armies and weapons.

932
01:30:02,875 --> 01:30:04,206
We are going to war now.

933
01:30:04,410 --> 01:30:06,537
Hail leader!

934
01:30:06,746 --> 01:30:09,271
Hail leader!

935
01:30:09,482 --> 01:30:12,110
With whom you're waging a war, brother?
l'll also join you.

936
01:30:12,318 --> 01:30:14,718
Why you when l'm here, brother.
My men !

937
01:30:14,921 --> 01:30:18,118
Son...Son !

938
01:30:18,491 --> 01:30:22,222
l heard you, mother.
Not only had he broken the promise,

939
01:30:22,395 --> 01:30:24,124
joining hands with those evil Kauravas,

940
01:30:24,330 --> 01:30:27,595
and belittled my world famous father,

941
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:31,395
these Yadavas,
how proud and arrogant!

942
01:30:31,604 --> 01:30:33,663
l'll avenge them.

943
01:30:33,873 --> 01:30:35,841
l'll finish both Yadavas and
Kauravas together in one go.

944
01:30:36,209 --> 01:30:38,302
lf l don't it, what for l've
all these powers then?

945
01:30:38,511 --> 01:30:39,842
Hail leader!

946
01:30:40,213 --> 01:30:44,309
Son, whether you or Abhimanyu going
to war with my brother is same,

947
01:30:44,517 --> 01:30:46,212
won't it bring bad name to me?

948
01:30:46,419 --> 01:30:50,879
Then, l'll go to Hastinapuram
and finish atleast Kauravas.

949
01:30:51,257 --> 01:30:54,522
You can't kill them, son.
Your father has made vows.

950
01:30:54,727 --> 01:30:57,161
Kauravas must live
to die in the hands Pandavas.

951
01:30:57,797 --> 01:31:02,598
Did you see brother? Our mothers
have dissipated all our powers.

952
01:31:03,436 --> 01:31:06,428
Follow my orders, son.
l'll appreciate you.

953
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:07,663
Go to Dwaraka,

954
01:31:07,874 --> 01:31:10,342
use your magical powers
and bring Sasirekha here,

955
01:31:10,543 --> 01:31:12,374
l'll get her married to him.

956
01:31:12,578 --> 01:31:15,172
Good, your order will be
implemented, mother.

957
01:31:15,381 --> 01:31:16,541
l'll go immediately.

958
01:31:16,749 --> 01:31:20,412
My dear men !
- Hail leader!

959
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:21,914
Son !
- Mother!

960
01:31:22,288 --> 01:31:27,521
l'll let you go only if you promise,
not to hurt or harm anyone there.

961
01:31:27,727 --> 01:31:29,854
My brother Krishna...
- ls he friend?

962
01:31:30,229 --> 01:31:31,491
My respects to him.

963
01:31:31,697 --> 01:31:36,794
On reaching there, meet him...
- Not meet, worship him.

964
01:31:37,003 --> 01:31:38,197
He'll be pleased.

965
01:31:38,404 --> 01:31:41,703
He will tell you the plan.
- So be it.

966
01:31:41,908 --> 01:31:44,342
Hail mother!

967
01:31:46,913 --> 01:31:50,713
Brother! You protect them
till l come back.

968
01:31:50,917 --> 01:31:53,385
As you say, brother.

969
01:31:54,620 --> 01:31:59,557
Hail leader!

970
01:32:35,516 --> 01:32:36,983
What's this?

971
01:32:37,585 --> 01:32:40,986
Move l say. Move!
Who are you?

972
01:33:28,769 --> 01:33:32,865
How am l to find Sasirekha among them?

973
01:33:34,408 --> 01:33:36,035
l came without knowing it.

974
01:33:38,579 --> 01:33:42,879
l'm in the same dilemma
my uncle Hanuman had in Lanka.

975
01:33:50,791 --> 01:34:00,564
May God bless you...

976
01:34:00,768 --> 01:34:02,929
What's there is not here...

977
01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:10,168
What's here is not there...

978
01:34:10,544 --> 01:34:18,417
lt's me there...it's me here...

979
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:32,832
Big fish will eat small fish,
big illusion will envelop smaller one...

980
01:34:33,034 --> 01:34:40,941
That will vanish...this will vanish...

981
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:54,454
Came without information,
will go unnoticed...

982
01:34:54,655 --> 01:35:02,084
This is Veda...

983
01:35:02,463 --> 01:35:03,555
Hey grandpa!

984
01:35:03,764 --> 01:35:07,131
Your Veda is good but tell me,
who you really are?

985
01:35:07,568 --> 01:35:12,164
ls it you?
Don't you know who l am?

986
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:13,529
l'm asking you because
l don't know, right?

987
01:35:13,741 --> 01:35:15,971
One who doesn't know,
even if l tell he'll not know.

988
01:35:16,177 --> 01:35:18,077
Hey grandpa! Stop your argument.

989
01:35:18,279 --> 01:35:19,974
l don't care who you may be,

990
01:35:20,915 --> 01:35:25,147
just tell me,
where can l find Sasirekha?

991
01:35:25,953 --> 01:35:28,513
Asking my help and shouting at me.

992
01:35:28,723 --> 01:35:32,056
Tell me your name, seek refuge
and ask humbly, l'll show you.

993
01:35:32,259 --> 01:35:34,989
Hey grandpa! Who do you think l'm?
Be careful.

994
01:35:35,196 --> 01:35:36,527
l can't hold my anger long,

995
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:38,596
l'll drown you and
your Dwaraka in sea.

996
01:35:38,799 --> 01:35:41,597
Wow! Are you so great?

997
01:35:41,802 --> 01:35:43,064
Why don't you tell me that?

998
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:46,239
You needn't do such great things,

999
01:35:46,607 --> 01:35:52,239
l'm old, l can't walk, carry me,
l'll show you Sasirekha.

1000
01:35:52,613 --> 01:35:55,844
That's better. Get up!

1001
01:35:56,550 --> 01:36:01,510
May God bless you !

1002
01:36:01,722 --> 01:36:07,183
May God bless you !

1003
01:36:11,632 --> 01:36:13,532
You're so heavy!

1004
01:36:13,734 --> 01:36:17,864
You threatened to drown Dwaraka.
Can't you carry me?

1005
01:36:27,748 --> 01:36:29,545
Carry me son...carry me.

1006
01:36:35,589 --> 01:36:38,558
Did you eat elephants for dinner?
What's the magic?

1007
01:36:38,759 --> 01:36:40,659
Big illusion will envelop smaller one...

1008
01:36:40,861 --> 01:36:43,159
That will vanish...this will vanish...

1009
01:36:43,364 --> 01:36:45,559
lt's me there...it's me here...

1010
01:36:45,766 --> 01:36:47,734
l'm that thing...l'm this thing...

1011
01:36:47,935 --> 01:36:53,237
l got it!
l bow before you !

1012
01:36:55,676 --> 01:37:04,015
l bow before you, Lord Krishna!
- Bless you !

1013
01:37:04,218 --> 01:37:07,346
l'm blessed, waiting for your order.

1014
01:37:09,223 --> 01:37:12,090
Your next duty is...

1015
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:16,357
Marry off illusion created Sasirekha
to Lakshmana Kumara.

1016
01:37:16,797 --> 01:37:18,697
Teach the Kauravas a lesson.

1017
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:22,166
Divine instruction !

1018
01:37:24,939 --> 01:37:28,033
From now, you're his favourite maid.

1019
01:37:28,676 --> 01:37:29,370
No problem.

1020
01:37:32,012 --> 01:37:34,606
Can l take leave now?
- Be careful, nephew.

1021
01:37:35,716 --> 01:37:38,207
Myna, show me the way to my harem.

1022
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:38,801
Hail Lord Krishna!

1023
01:38:40,981 --> 01:38:42,915
Hail mother!

1024

What a beauty!

1025
01:38:45,686 --> 01:38:47,779
Your daughter-in-law is very beautiful.

1026
01:38:47,988 --> 01:38:51,424
Had no problem there, right son?
- No mother...no.

1027
01:38:51,792 --> 01:38:54,454
Everything went off peacefully.

1028
01:38:55,095 --> 01:38:57,825
Lord Krishna's blessings, mother.

1029
01:38:58,065 --> 01:39:05,062

marry Lakshmana Kumara.

1030
01:39:05,272 --> 01:39:07,365
You?
- Yes mother, l have to.

1031
01:39:09,176 --> 01:39:12,236
Sister-in-law is waking up,
l'll take leave.

1032
01:39:16,417 --> 01:39:20,877
Dashed my hopes and spoilt my mind.

1033
01:39:22,356 --> 01:39:24,790
l don't want to live.

1034
01:39:27,127 --> 01:39:30,221
Poor girl is still lamenting.

1035
01:39:30,431 --> 01:39:35,733
Sasi, look! lt's me!

1036
01:39:36,770 --> 01:39:37,794
Aunt!

1037
01:39:43,811 --> 01:39:44,800
Me?

1038
01:39:48,749 --> 01:39:49,773
Where are we?

1039
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:53,283
Don't get scared, l'll tell you.
Get up dear.

1040
01:39:56,490 --> 01:39:59,288
Did you hear me?
Spoil the marriage.

1041
01:40:00,294 --> 01:40:01,022
Leader!

1042
01:40:01,228 --> 01:40:06,825
Use your magical powers & illusion
to create a guest city for Kauravas.

1043
01:40:07,134 --> 01:40:09,500
Spellbound them with your magic.

1044
01:40:09,870 --> 01:40:11,337
Hail leader!

1045
01:40:11,972 --> 01:40:12,768
Hail leader!

1046
01:40:12,973 --> 01:40:13,769
Hail leader!

1047
01:40:13,974 --> 01:40:17,341
Use your intelligence and
teach Kauravas a fitting lesson.

1048
01:40:17,778 --> 01:40:21,111
We can't conduct a marriage...
- Spoiling it is easy...

1049
01:40:26,153 --> 01:40:28,451
Get going!

1050
01:40:35,362 --> 01:40:37,455
Where's brother?

1051
01:40:39,099 --> 01:40:40,293
Brother!

1052
01:41:07,361 --> 01:41:12,458
Beau got beaten up!

1053
01:41:12,833 --> 01:41:13,822
Who is it?

1054
01:41:17,037 --> 01:41:18,937
How did you come here?
- Stay away.

1055
01:41:19,139 --> 01:41:21,903
Calling me now after
leaving me alone there.

1056
01:41:22,109 --> 01:41:23,974
What is this, Sasi?
- Stay away.

1057
01:41:24,144 --> 01:41:25,338
Why are you so angry?

1058
01:41:25,646 --> 01:41:29,207
Don't you know l didn't take
chances respecting elders' words.

1059
01:41:29,416 --> 01:41:32,385
Fair enough ! You must get good
name for respecting elders,

1060
01:41:32,586 --> 01:41:35,350
and l must get bad name
for going against elders.

1061
01:41:35,656 --> 01:41:37,851
Enough, good bye to you
and your love.

1062
01:41:38,058 --> 01:41:39,116
Now, it's brotherly love between us.

1063
01:41:39,326 --> 01:41:41,226
Sasi! What are you saying?

1064
01:41:41,428 --> 01:41:43,555
lf you ask, what?
lt's like that only.

1065
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:46,362
l can't bear your sorrows or
pangs of separation any more.

1066
01:41:46,567 --> 01:41:50,367
l promised to marry
Lakshmana Kumara. l will.

1067
01:41:50,938 --> 01:41:52,428
ls it my Sasi who is saying this?

1068
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:56,302
No, l'm a brand new Sasi.
Totally changed.

1069
01:41:56,510 --> 01:41:59,104
l'll marry Lakshmana Kumara,
ride on elephant,

1070
01:41:59,313 --> 01:42:02,373
and go to palace in a procession.
- What's this nasty?

1071
01:42:02,583 --> 01:42:06,178
Are you possessed by ghost?
- Not ghost but demon.

1072
01:42:06,387 --> 01:42:11,381
But now, it's brotherly love between us.
Come brother. Come.

1073
01:42:13,994 --> 01:42:15,484
l'm really very lucky, dear.

1074
01:42:15,696 --> 01:42:18,631
Krishna, Rukmini,
Balarama, Revathi,

1075
01:42:18,999 --> 01:42:20,557
everyone will come to
my home for you.

1076
01:42:21,001 --> 01:42:23,231
Aunt...where is my beau?

1077
01:42:23,437 --> 01:42:26,565
l'm coming, sister-in-law.
Come, brother.

1078
01:42:32,312 --> 01:42:33,609
Did you see, brother?

1079
01:42:33,981 --> 01:42:35,608
Give away me in marriage
to Lakshmana Kumara,

1080
01:42:35,983 --> 01:42:37,917
you take your Sasi.

1081
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:42,548
ls this also Lord Krishna's instruction, son?

1082
01:42:42,923 --> 01:42:44,151
Yes mother.

1083
01:42:44,358 --> 01:42:50,058
God only knows how that groom
is going to bear me as the bride.

1084
01:42:51,932 --> 01:42:54,526
How about brother-in-law's voice, aunt?

1085
01:42:56,003 --> 01:43:00,633
Don't worry about me, sister-in-law,
take good care of him.

1086
01:43:01,308 --> 01:43:05,074
Auspicious time is nearing,
l'm leaving now.

1087
01:43:05,345 --> 01:43:07,279
Hail mother!

1088
01:43:10,684 --> 01:43:12,948
Hail Lord Krishna!

1089
01:43:54,628 --> 01:43:56,357
Astonishing!

1090
01:43:56,563 --> 01:43:58,155
Don't praise.

1091
01:43:58,365 --> 01:44:01,425
lt's all empty.

1092
01:44:01,635 --> 01:44:06,004
Where are the things to
take task our new guests?

1093
01:44:06,206 --> 01:44:10,142
Things? Look yonder!

1094
01:44:18,218 --> 01:44:20,516
lt's serpent jewels.

1095
01:44:22,456 --> 01:44:23,514
These are...

1096
01:44:44,745 --> 01:44:46,804
These are?
- Dolls.

1097
01:45:36,830 --> 01:45:38,593
Look at this!

1098
01:46:39,327 --> 01:46:41,887
Madam Sasirekha!

1099
01:46:42,497 --> 01:46:43,896
Madam bride!

1100
01:46:45,233 --> 01:46:48,225
lt's morning, please wake up.

1101
01:46:49,004 --> 01:46:50,369
Madam bride.

1102
01:47:06,254 --> 01:47:09,985
Madam...Sasirekha...
why are you staring at me?

1103
01:47:10,358 --> 01:47:12,588
l'm your favourite maid.

1104
01:47:12,794 --> 01:47:16,355
Yes...you're my favourite maid.
What happened?

1105
01:47:16,565 --> 01:47:20,365
Did you have any bad dream?
You gave a loud cry!

1106
01:47:20,569 --> 01:47:23,902
Yes, a bad dream,
dreamt of becoming a devil.

1107
01:47:24,272 --> 01:47:25,637
lt seems my voice too
had changed.

1108
01:47:25,841 --> 01:47:28,275
Have l got back my original voice?
- Yes, madam.

1109
01:47:28,476 --> 01:47:32,344
Please be fine and subtle,
other maids are scared.

1110
01:47:32,547 --> 01:47:34,777
Oh maids!

1111
01:47:36,785 --> 01:47:38,514
Why are you afraid of me?

1112
01:47:42,490 --> 01:47:44,287
What's this?
Who put a broken pedestal here?

1113
01:47:44,492 --> 01:47:46,016
Poor girls! Don't shout at them.

1114
01:47:46,394 --> 01:47:50,797
l could've been little subtle.
Maids, come.

1115
01:47:51,366 --> 01:47:56,303
Madam, you appear very strange today.

1116
01:47:57,305 --> 01:48:01,298
Am l still that old Sasirekha?

1117
01:48:01,509 --> 01:48:05,707
No, l'm queen of Lakshmana Kumara.

1118
01:48:05,914 --> 01:48:11,045
l mean my husband is future king,
and l'm future queen.

1119
01:48:11,419 --> 01:48:14,911
You shouldn't say like that madam,
look, your mother Revathi is coming.

1120
01:48:15,123 --> 01:48:18,991
Mother? Oh God! Mother!

1121
01:48:21,563 --> 01:48:24,760
Hail mother, l bow to you.

1122
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:27,561
Really my daughter?
Did you see her Rukmini?

1123
01:48:27,769 --> 01:48:32,570
Mother Rukmini! l bow to you.

1124
01:48:32,807 --> 01:48:39,713
Hail Krishna!
- Bless you !

1125
01:48:39,915 --> 01:48:42,042
Have we become strangers already, Sasi?

1126
01:48:42,417 --> 01:48:44,078
You're showing so much respect.

1127
01:48:44,452 --> 01:48:46,079
l'm just following your advice.

1128
01:48:46,454 --> 01:48:49,787
Let it be anyone's advice dear,
you've become intelligent.

1129
01:48:49,991 --> 01:48:51,458
That's enough for me.

1130
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:54,993
Krishna, l'm really very happy.

1131
01:48:55,363 --> 01:48:57,888
lf you conduct this marriage
with great fanfare...

1132
01:48:58,099 --> 01:49:00,863
As you say sister-in-law.
You will see it.

1133
01:49:01,736 --> 01:49:04,000
Bless you !

1134
01:49:04,372 --> 01:49:06,499
Bless you !

1135
01:49:46,715 --> 01:50:01,790
Welcome...no one to
match your greatness...

1136
01:50:01,997 --> 01:50:03,157
Great benefactors...

1137
01:50:03,531 --> 01:50:04,429
Great souls...

1138
01:50:04,632 --> 01:50:09,501
Wealthiest...

1139
01:50:09,704 --> 01:50:14,664
Accept our hospitality befitting
your status and honour...

1140
01:50:14,876 --> 01:50:16,901
Only you can match yourselves...

1141
01:50:17,112 --> 01:50:20,445
All this grand welcome
is for you only...

1142
01:50:41,669 --> 01:50:43,637
Welcome bridegroom...

1143
01:50:43,838 --> 01:50:47,467
We are lucky to play host to you...

1144
01:50:57,118 --> 01:51:07,187
You're the son-in-law we brought
searching all the 3 worlds...

1145
01:51:07,562 --> 01:51:09,757
Get down from the palanquin...

1146
01:51:09,964 --> 01:51:15,493
All this grand reception
is for you only...

1147
01:51:22,911 --> 01:51:26,039
Did you see the lavishness
of the Yadavas?

1148
01:51:26,247 --> 01:51:28,511
This fortune, these riches,

1149
01:51:28,716 --> 01:51:29,614
this exhibition,

1150
01:51:29,818 --> 01:51:32,685
l think they did this to upstage us.

1151
01:51:32,887 --> 01:51:35,219
Any doubt in it?

1152
01:51:35,590 --> 01:51:39,219
When Krishna promised
to conduct the marriage,

1153
01:51:39,594 --> 01:51:41,653
l expected a grand fair only.

1154
01:51:41,863 --> 01:51:44,525
Whatever they may do,
it's nothing compared to your riches.

1155
01:51:44,732 --> 01:51:46,700
Well said, uncle.

1156
01:51:47,836 --> 01:51:49,235
We are blessed along with you, Lords.

1157
01:51:49,604 --> 01:51:53,904
What a great welcome!
What a great hospitality!

1158
01:51:54,109 --> 01:51:56,805
Who can match this grandeur?

1159
01:51:57,011 --> 01:51:59,775
Greater than every king of this world!

1160
01:51:59,981 --> 01:52:02,745
People not seeing this grandeur
have wasted their lives.

1161
01:52:02,951 --> 01:52:06,045
This is what you call prosperity.

1162
01:52:06,254 --> 01:52:12,625
Your kinsman's riches,
run out of words to praise it!

1163
01:52:13,361 --> 01:52:15,886
What's this nuisance, uncle?

1164
01:52:22,003 --> 01:52:25,769
You both are scholars but
have no common sense.

1165
01:52:25,974 --> 01:52:27,032
As you say.

1166
01:52:27,242 --> 01:52:30,837
How dare you praise
others before your lord?

1167
01:52:31,045 --> 01:52:33,878
Our mistake, please forgive us, lord.

1168
01:52:34,082 --> 01:52:35,879
Got emotional and blurted out truth...

1169
01:52:36,084 --> 01:52:39,679
Though it's true, never praise others.

1170
01:52:39,888 --> 01:52:42,083
We are grooms' side.
Behave highhandedly!

1171
01:52:42,290 --> 01:52:45,851
Finding faults in everything,
irritate them.

1172
01:52:46,060 --> 01:52:48,028
Got you lord.
- What did you get?

1173
01:52:48,229 --> 01:52:52,256
Watch out now!
We'll torture your kinsmen.

1174
01:53:19,661 --> 01:53:21,754
Wow! lt's my marriage...

1175
01:53:22,363 --> 01:53:24,627
Great! lt's my marriage...

1176
01:53:28,069 --> 01:53:29,400
l'm done with you...

1177
01:53:29,771 --> 01:53:32,399
And the world is in chaos...

1178
01:53:52,060 --> 01:53:53,220
lt seems mighty great warriors...

1179
01:53:53,428 --> 01:53:55,726
lt seems richest of the rich...

1180
01:53:56,364 --> 01:54:00,095
Marriage party has come
crying this aloud...

1181
01:54:29,197 --> 01:54:32,860
lt seems l'm maiden...
and very delicate...

1182
01:54:36,404 --> 01:54:39,862
lt seems groom will get
charmed on seeing me...

1183
01:55:02,096 --> 01:55:06,157
lt's seems he'll come
to tie the knot...

1184
01:55:06,367 --> 01:55:08,733
And l'll feel too shy...

1185
01:55:39,901 --> 01:55:43,268
Play hide and seek game
under the veil...

1186
01:55:55,049 --> 01:55:57,415
Grandpa!
- What's it son?

1187
01:55:57,785 --> 01:56:01,482
have we arrived in the guest house?
- Yes. Surely.

1188
01:56:01,856 --> 01:56:03,881
You promised to show the bride to me,
where is she?

1189
01:56:04,092 --> 01:56:05,559
l'll call her immediately.

1190
01:56:05,927 --> 01:56:10,387
l'll send them message that you want
to meet your daughter-in-law.

1191
01:56:10,598 --> 01:56:13,533
Revathi will send her daughter happily.

1192
01:56:13,901 --> 01:56:19,840
Yes, l'm also eager to meet her.
What if she feels shy to meet him?

1193
01:56:20,041 --> 01:56:21,838
She can't be brave wife
if she feels shy,

1194
01:56:22,043 --> 01:56:23,010
not only see her,
l want to talk to her.

1195
01:56:23,211 --> 01:56:27,307
My word...
- ...is irrevocable.

1196
01:56:27,515 --> 01:56:31,246
l know it, l'll send a message.
- As you wish.

1197
01:56:42,063 --> 01:56:43,530
We are marriage conductors.

1198
01:56:43,898 --> 01:56:47,493
Mustn't fight with people of kinsmen.
- Okay.

1199
01:56:51,906 --> 01:56:55,501
Are you marriage conductors?
You look like fools.

1200
01:56:57,945 --> 01:57:00,470
Where have we lacked in
looking after you, sirs

1201
01:57:00,848 --> 01:57:03,908
Lacking every sphere.
Come l'll show you.

1202
01:57:08,322 --> 01:57:11,018
Such cheap blankets for us?
- What?

1203
01:57:11,225 --> 01:57:14,854
Even when given to maid servants,

Your reluctance is
increasing my sorrows...

1278
02:03:35,342 --> 02:03:38,334
What to do if it increases?
Elders are here.

1279
02:03:39,346 --> 02:03:42,747
Why are you holding back
citing elders, O maiden...

They have insulted us.

Let's complain with Shakuni
and take them to task.

1334
02:12:39,669 --> 02:12:42,160
Let's teach them a lesson.

1335

What are you looking for?
Empty vessels only, come.

1336
02:13:04,361 --> 02:13:06,226
By the way, you liked the bride, lord?

Not just like,

desired her,

1339
02:13:14,304 --> 02:13:15,896
and sang a song too.

1340
02:13:16,706 --> 02:13:20,073
What about the bride?
- Bride? Silly bride!

1341
02:13:20,277 --> 02:13:22,211
She asked me stay away
saying elders are there.

02:13:22,412 --> 02:13:24,573
Told me to wait till tomorrow.

1343

How can l wait till tomorrow?

1344
02:13:26,917 --> 02:13:30,182
You're strong and great,
Abhimanyu would be dead by now.

Well said Sarathy.
- Why Lord?

1346
02:13:32,722 --> 02:13:36,249
They get stuck on joining.

1347
02:13:38,195 --> 02:13:42,029
They ate the feast themselves
and kept empty vessels for us.

1348
02:13:42,232 --> 02:13:43,529
Did you see?

1349
02:13:53,276 --> 02:13:54,265

02:13:54,477 --> 02:13:55,637
Stuffed sweets.
- Stuffed sweets.

1351
02:14:03,320 --> 02:14:07,120
l told you to play with kinsmen,
are you playing with me?

1352
02:14:07,324 --> 02:14:09,451
Are you possessed by ghost?

1353
02:14:09,960 --> 02:14:13,123
What's that? l've been watching
you since coming here,

1354
02:14:13,330 --> 02:14:15,628
you seem to losing your senses,

1355
02:14:15,999 --> 02:14:19,696

l'll get you a good head massage.

1356

Be careful!

02:15:03,213 --> 02:15:05,977
l want foam bed.

1362
02:15:13,356 --> 02:15:16,018
Enemies are coming.

1363
02:15:22,499 --> 02:15:24,763
The feast fiasco.

1364
02:15:25,135 --> 02:15:26,466
Was it illusion?

1365
02:15:26,736 --> 02:15:27,634
Was it myth?

1366
02:15:27,837 --> 02:15:29,270
Was it magic?

1367
02:15:29,472 --> 02:15:33,203
What do you say?
- Nothing, pure hallucination.

1368
02:15:33,410 --> 02:15:35,469
You think like that?
- Yes.

1369
02:15:41,251 --> 02:15:42,718
ls it carpet?

1370
02:15:43,086 --> 02:15:45,054
They removed smaller one
and laid a bigger one.

1371
02:15:45,255 --> 02:15:48,691
They thought it's bigger carpet.

1372
02:15:49,059 --> 02:15:52,222
Their ancestors must come down for it.

1373
02:15:53,330 --> 02:15:54,592
Betel leaves!

1374
02:16:17,487 --> 02:16:19,114
What we saw, vanished away.

1375
02:16:19,322 --> 02:16:21,586
What vanished, appeared again.

1376
02:16:27,397 --> 02:16:30,764
Do you think this is also hallucination?
- Yes, hallucination only.

1377
02:16:41,411 --> 02:16:47,247
Reason for this hallucinations.
- Nothing much, a form of madness.

1378
02:16:48,685 --> 02:16:50,277
What's this?

1379
02:16:50,487 --> 02:16:52,250
Carpet is new one.
That's why it's rolling up.

1380
02:16:52,455 --> 02:16:55,720
Let's spread it.

1381
02:17:15,445 --> 02:17:17,743
ls this also hallucination?

1382
02:17:17,947 --> 02:17:20,643
This is delusion.

1383
02:17:26,956 --> 02:17:30,517
What's this now?
- This is illusion.

1384
02:17:30,727 --> 02:17:35,221
We don't need any illusion
or carpets, let's go.

1385
02:17:56,753 --> 02:18:00,189
Foam bed!
- Foam bed!

1386
02:18:00,924 --> 02:18:05,861
Carpet trouble is over
but foam bed is great.

1387
02:19:03,453 --> 02:19:05,387
Open the door.

1388
02:19:06,389 --> 02:19:08,914
Open the door!

1389
02:19:12,061 --> 02:19:15,326
Open it...open it.

1390
02:19:27,677 --> 02:19:30,737
Sarathy? ls it you who fell?

1391
02:19:30,947 --> 02:19:35,281
Fell? l was doing somersaults.
- ls it? Get up.

1392
02:19:35,485 --> 02:19:38,283
Why are you sitting in a corner
leaving the carpet and foam bed?

1393
02:19:38,488 --> 02:19:44,358
That's for men like you.
- Please, go ahead.- Okay.

1394
02:19:53,803 --> 02:19:56,363
What's this?
ls it a place to keep your slippers?

1395
02:19:56,573 --> 02:19:59,667
Do you've any sense?
- No, we didn't keep it there.

1396
02:19:59,876 --> 02:20:02,811
lf not, did it come here on it's own?

1397
02:20:04,113 --> 02:20:06,479
Mat be, we didn't see.

1398
02:20:12,855 --> 02:20:15,415
Foam bed!

1399
02:20:15,625 --> 02:20:18,992
What a luxury!

1400
02:20:22,632 --> 02:20:23,997
Heavenly!

1401
02:20:24,367 --> 02:20:26,835
What a great comfort!

1402
02:20:27,070 --> 02:20:29,402
Did you see the foam bed?

1403
02:20:30,540 --> 02:20:32,337
Heaven...it's heaven.

1404
02:20:58,568 --> 02:21:00,058
Just a while ago,
you laughed loud at me.

1405
02:21:00,436 --> 02:21:02,870
Now, it's nothing. Very good.

1406
02:21:28,798 --> 02:21:34,100
May you be blessed with peace!

1407
02:21:39,957 --> 02:21:41,515
What brings you at this hour?

1408
02:21:43,193 --> 02:21:48,654
After meeting the bride,
l'm confused.

1409
02:21:49,566 --> 02:21:51,227
l feel like cancelling this marriage.

1410
02:21:51,602 --> 02:21:55,504
Did you see? That's Krishna's magic.

1411
02:21:55,706 --> 02:22:03,010
He made Sasi to act like this so that
we'll cancel the marriage ourselves.

1412
02:22:03,580 --> 02:22:06,071
Can we fall into his trap?

1413
02:22:06,583 --> 02:22:11,680
Let the marriage be over,
everything will be fine.

1414
02:22:12,189 --> 02:22:13,247
Understood, mother?

1415
02:22:13,624 --> 02:22:15,751
At the same time
when l tie knot there,

1416
02:22:15,959 --> 02:22:19,122
Lord Krishna's order that
they must tie the knot here.

1417
02:22:19,329 --> 02:22:20,694
ln my brother's absence?

1418
02:22:20,897 --> 02:22:24,594
No need to doubt it,
he'll be here as well as there.

1419
02:22:24,801 --> 02:22:26,029
Omnipresent.

1420
02:22:26,236 --> 02:22:29,205
l'll go now,
stop the marriage there,

1421
02:22:29,573 --> 02:22:33,168
l'll be here with Balarama and others
in time to bless the new couple.

1422
02:22:33,543 --> 02:22:35,272
l'll purify our ashram, mother.

1423
02:22:35,646 --> 02:22:38,240
Do it son, l'll appreciate you.

1424
02:22:38,615 --> 02:22:40,879
Hail Lord Krishna!

1425
02:23:08,111 --> 02:23:21,354
We all are happy that Sasirekha
is the bride...

1426
02:23:24,995 --> 02:23:37,169
We all are happy that Lakshmana
is the bridegroom...

1427
02:23:40,844 --> 02:23:48,615
As Kauravas and Yadavas
become kinsmen...

1428
02:23:48,819 --> 02:23:56,624
Marriage festivities are going
on with great fanfare...

1429
02:23:56,827 --> 02:24:04,700
We all are happy that Sasirekha
is the bride...

1430
02:24:04,901 --> 02:24:12,637
We all are happy that Abhimanyu
is the bridegroom...

1431
02:24:33,296 --> 02:24:38,825
For me...for me...for me...

1432
02:24:39,069 --> 02:24:40,934
Who are they?
- Our brothers!

1433
02:24:41,138 --> 02:24:49,842
For me...for me...for me...

1434
02:25:01,925 --> 02:25:03,222
What's your objection?
Remove the screen.

1435
02:25:03,426 --> 02:25:06,293
You mustn't say like that,
they may feel bad.

1436
02:25:06,496 --> 02:25:08,225
l don't care about al that,
l'm the groom.

1437
02:25:08,431 --> 02:25:09,989
l've every right to see the bride.

1438
02:25:10,200 --> 02:25:12,361
Grandpa, father-in-law,
get the screen removed.

1439
02:25:16,373 --> 02:25:17,431
What's your problem, son?

1440
02:25:17,808 --> 02:25:19,366
Why a screen hurdle between
me and the bride?

1441
02:25:19,743 --> 02:25:20,710
Get it removed.

1442
02:25:20,911 --> 02:25:22,276
What is he saying?

1443
02:25:22,479 --> 02:25:26,313
Nothing, it's not our tradition
to hold the screen for so long.

1444
02:25:26,516 --> 02:25:27,210
That's it.

1445
02:25:27,417 --> 02:25:31,285
l think following our traditions
in our place is justified.

1446
02:25:31,488 --> 02:25:35,720
Which ever place it may be,
let it be done as they wish.

1447
02:25:35,926 --> 02:25:38,827
That's what l'm also saying.
Remove the screen.

1448
02:25:41,731 --> 02:25:44,097
Great! Our boy has established
our supremacy.

1449
02:25:44,301 --> 02:25:48,431
l told you Lakshmana has
more pride than father.

1450
02:25:48,805 --> 02:25:53,037
Karna, l feel pity on seeing
Krishna's predicament.

1451
02:25:53,243 --> 02:25:56,906
lt's not yet over,
the worse has to come.

1452
02:25:58,448 --> 02:26:00,939
Carry on the function
according to our traditions.

1453
02:26:01,151 --> 02:26:02,345
As you say, okay.

1454
02:26:02,552 --> 02:26:05,112
First the bride and groom
must stamp each other's feet,

1455
02:26:05,322 --> 02:26:06,983
after that pressing hand.

1456
02:26:07,190 --> 02:26:09,181
What's that nonsense?

1457
02:26:09,392 --> 02:26:15,353
You must stamp on the toe of the
bride's left leg with your right leg..

1458
02:26:15,565 --> 02:26:17,430
l'm ready for it.

1459
02:26:18,501 --> 02:26:23,529
You mustn't feel so shy.
You must also do it to him.

1460
02:26:24,140 --> 02:26:26,267
What if he gets angry?

1461
02:26:27,077 --> 02:26:30,274
Why would l get angry?
l'm ready for it.

1462
02:26:50,200 --> 02:26:55,297
No the bride must press your toe.
- No objection.

1463
02:27:06,883 --> 02:27:08,111
You killed me...killed me...

1464
02:27:08,318 --> 02:27:10,809
Can you press my toe then?

1465
02:27:11,221 --> 02:27:14,486
Now pressing hand, right?
- Tell her to do it.

1466
02:27:14,858 --> 02:27:18,157
You know to dance well!
- l do.

1467
02:27:29,873 --> 02:27:34,003
Now, bride must press your hand.
- No need.

1468
02:27:34,210 --> 02:27:36,508
No, you mustn't say no.
Give your hand to her.

1469
02:27:48,658 --> 02:27:53,095
My hand!
- What do you want?

1470
02:27:53,296 --> 02:27:54,854
l want rice to bless.
- Rice to bless?

1471
02:27:55,065 --> 02:27:56,999
lt's last in the program.

1472
02:27:57,901 --> 02:27:59,562
What's all this, Krishna?

1473
02:27:59,936 --> 02:28:02,461
Modern time youth are like that.

1474
02:28:02,672 --> 02:28:06,574
Son-in-law, my daughter is little scared,

1475
02:28:06,943 --> 02:28:10,003
do it little slowly.

1476
02:28:10,313 --> 02:28:14,010
lf scared she can't a warrioris wife.

1477
02:28:14,250 --> 02:28:18,311
Wow uncle! He gave a
good repartee to Krishna.

1478
02:28:20,357 --> 02:28:23,224
Keep this jaggery and
cumin seeds on the bride's head.

1479
02:28:23,426 --> 02:28:24,654
l know.

1480
02:28:34,704 --> 02:28:38,868
Monkey...monkey...monkey...

1481
02:28:39,075 --> 02:28:42,169
What's this?
- Monkey!

1482
02:28:42,379 --> 02:28:44,540
What is it?
- Monkey, grandpa.

1483
02:28:44,914 --> 02:28:46,040
Come with me.

1484
02:28:54,924 --> 02:28:58,587
Why are you calling
a beautiful girl as monkey?

1485
02:28:58,962 --> 02:29:00,987
ls it time to romance?

1486
02:29:01,297 --> 02:29:02,093
Go ahead.

1487
02:29:08,505 --> 02:29:09,938
Keep it on her head.

1488
02:29:41,504 --> 02:29:43,665
Can't you hold it back?

1489
02:29:44,040 --> 02:29:45,302
Go ahead, finish it.

1490
02:29:52,282 --> 02:29:56,685
l think change of water,
these sneezes are not harmful.

1491
02:29:57,053 --> 02:29:58,577
Carry on.

1492
02:29:58,788 --> 02:30:02,656
Poor guys, change of water.
- Poor guys.

1493
02:30:21,044 --> 02:30:27,005
Tiger! Tiger...father...tiger...

1494
02:30:27,217 --> 02:30:29,276
What's this Lakshmana?
- Tiger...

1495
02:30:29,486 --> 02:30:32,512
lt's not tiger, he's Krishna.
- Yes, son-in-law.

1496
02:30:34,257 --> 02:30:37,055
Mother! Why are they insulting me?

1497
02:30:37,260 --> 02:30:39,660
l don't know, dear.
Don't know what was my sin?

1498
02:30:40,029 --> 02:30:43,192
Hubby! Didn't you see the groom earlier?

1499
02:30:43,433 --> 02:30:47,802
Why didn't you tell me Duryodhana?
ls your son mad?

1500
02:30:49,272 --> 02:30:52,298
Forgive me, our prince is a brave warrior,

1501
02:30:52,509 --> 02:30:55,501
l'm surprized to see him so scared,

1502
02:30:55,712 --> 02:30:58,738
l think enemies would've used
black magic on the way.

1503
02:30:59,115 --> 02:31:03,484
You know everything, smear
sacred ash and tie an amulet.

1504
02:31:04,053 --> 02:31:04,712
Come here.

1505
02:31:06,856 --> 02:31:13,056
This is holy armour!
- This will protect you.

1506
02:31:21,271 --> 02:31:23,239
Whatever it may be,
l don't want to marry her.

1507
02:31:23,439 --> 02:31:24,667
Tiger...tiger...

1508
02:31:24,874 --> 02:31:27,342
lf you refuse,
Abhimanyu will marry her.

1509
02:31:27,544 --> 02:31:30,638
No away, l want her.
- Then come.

1510
02:32:00,510 --> 02:32:01,602
Devil!

1511
02:32:07,750 --> 02:32:08,546
Uncle!

1512
02:32:24,367 --> 02:32:26,665
Oh ! Prince has fainted.

1513
02:32:26,869 --> 02:32:29,269
lmmediate duty?
- Get him out of it.

1514
02:32:29,472 --> 02:32:30,530
No use.

1515
02:32:30,740 --> 02:32:34,267
He'll not wake up till this
magical illusion is broken.

1516
02:32:34,544 --> 02:32:35,841
What's all this, uncle?

1517
02:32:36,212 --> 02:32:40,672
l suspected foul play when Krishna
supported this marriage.

1518
02:32:40,883 --> 02:32:43,750
l had a doubt the moment
l saw bride in the guest house.

1519
02:32:43,953 --> 02:32:46,888
Now l've understood this illusion.

1520
02:32:47,257 --> 02:32:48,485
l'm telling for sure,

1521
02:32:48,691 --> 02:32:51,751
Balarama, the girl you see here
is not your daughter Sasi,

1522
02:32:51,961 --> 02:32:53,223
she's a devil,

1523
02:32:53,429 --> 02:32:56,660
it's your brother Krishna
who has cheated you and me.

1524
02:32:56,866 --> 02:32:58,731
My brother?

1525
02:32:59,235 --> 02:33:00,725
What are you saying?

1526
02:33:01,437 --> 02:33:05,237
Brother, don't get angry.

1527
02:33:06,175 --> 02:33:08,905
l've brought the seat to
unmask who is cheat.

1528
02:33:09,279 --> 02:33:12,874
Hey cheating gambler!
Are you here without any bad intention?

1529
02:33:13,249 --> 02:33:16,184
Come and stand on it and speak.

1530
02:33:16,586 --> 02:33:19,714
Okay, l'll stand on it and speak,
let me see what you'll know.

1531
02:33:19,922 --> 02:33:22,516
Uncle!
- Don't get scared.

1532
02:33:22,725 --> 02:33:27,958
Unless l say on my own,
how can anyone know my treachery?

1533
02:33:36,272 --> 02:33:37,432
Uncle...uncle...

1534
02:33:37,640 --> 02:33:40,734
Don't disturb him.
l must know the truth.

1535
02:33:40,943 --> 02:33:43,411
Sathyaki, get me the plough.

1536
02:33:43,613 --> 02:33:46,446
Calm down Balarama.

1537
02:33:46,783 --> 02:33:51,743
l swear on my dice and tell you the truth.

1538
02:33:51,954 --> 02:33:53,319
Listen.

1539
02:33:53,790 --> 02:33:57,988
We usurped kingdom of Pandavas by
cheating them in the game of dice.

1540
02:33:58,428 --> 02:34:01,761
They kept their promise
and went into exile.

1541
02:34:01,964 --> 02:34:04,956
You came rushing to punish us
on hearing this.

1542
02:34:05,335 --> 02:34:08,896
But you're a foolish innocent Yadava.

1543
02:34:09,439 --> 02:34:13,876
l know you'll easily fall for
praise and felicitation.

1544
02:34:14,243 --> 02:34:15,505
You did fall for it.

1545
02:34:15,712 --> 02:34:17,509
Though you're not equal to us,

1546
02:34:17,714 --> 02:34:20,512
do you know why we insisted on
accepting your daughter in marriage?

1547
02:34:20,717 --> 02:34:24,244
lf Pandavas attack us
after the exile period,

1548
02:34:24,454 --> 02:34:29,255
to keep you and your brother
away from joining their ranks.

1549
02:34:29,459 --> 02:34:32,951
Like as you sow so you reap,

1550
02:34:33,329 --> 02:34:35,695
we did get a good stick for it,

1551
02:34:37,333 --> 02:34:41,292
Krishna, these cheats shouldn't
be left with this punishment,

1552
02:34:41,504 --> 02:34:44,405
where's my plough?
- Brother!

1553
02:34:54,517 --> 02:34:56,781
Elder uncle, l bow to you.

1554
02:34:57,286 --> 02:35:01,279
You needn't have to strain yourself,
l'm here to finish them.

1555
02:35:01,491 --> 02:35:06,292
Who are you?
- Me? Who am l?

1556
02:35:07,497 --> 02:35:09,829
When you were arrested by Angels,

1557
02:35:10,032 --> 02:35:13,798
Arjuna who came to release you free,

1558
02:35:14,003 --> 02:35:16,938
l'm his elder brother Bhima's son.

1559
02:35:17,306 --> 02:35:22,642
ls it you Ghatotkacha?
Karna...Dushyasana...hold him.

1560
02:35:34,090 --> 02:35:35,682
You evil minded!

1561
02:35:35,892 --> 02:35:40,761
Weapons are protecting their
honour by not coming out.

1562
02:35:47,370 --> 02:35:50,464
Duryodhana, you were arrogant
about your wealth.

1563
02:35:50,673 --> 02:35:53,301
Watch out, what happens
to your wealth.

1564
02:36:29,612 --> 02:36:34,743
Save us...save us...

1565
02:36:34,951 --> 02:36:37,511
Their cries are music to my ears.

1566
02:36:39,889 --> 02:36:43,086
Cowards! l'll not kill refugees.

1567
02:36:43,459 --> 02:36:48,988
Tie the Kauravas and
dump them in Hastinapuram.

1568
02:37:24,534 --> 02:37:27,435
l bow to you, please forgive me.

1569
02:37:27,637 --> 02:37:29,070
Bless you.

1570
02:37:29,438 --> 02:37:33,431
l never expected Bhima's son
will be so clever.

1571
02:37:33,643 --> 02:37:35,440
By the way, where's our daughter?

1572
02:37:35,645 --> 02:37:37,943
Krishna! Where is Sasi?

1573
02:37:38,147 --> 02:37:39,614
Son-in-law!

1574
02:37:40,082 --> 02:37:42,676
l bow to you.
A request to elder aunt.

1575
02:37:42,885 --> 02:37:48,152
Sasi and Abhimanyu got married
in the same fixed time in my home,

1576
02:37:48,524 --> 02:37:51,982
you must come, bless them
and be my guests.

1577
02:37:52,194 --> 02:37:54,628
Why are you still here? Let's go.

1578
02:37:55,631 --> 02:37:56,791
Come brother.

1579
02:38:15,851 --> 02:38:20,185
Sister-in-law Hidamba!
My daughter got married in your home.

1580
02:38:20,556 --> 02:38:24,253
Wherever the marriage may take place,
l don't have any objections.

1581
02:38:24,961 --> 02:38:26,929
Repeating my words to me.

1582
02:38:27,496 --> 02:38:28,155
Come dear.

1583
02:38:29,999 --> 02:38:33,730
l'm handing my daughter
happily to you.

1584
02:38:33,936 --> 02:38:37,599
Whatever it is, my son is
responsible for this to happen.

1585
02:38:37,807 --> 02:38:38,774
That gives me immense happiness.

1586
02:38:38,975 --> 02:38:40,203
No mother...no.

1587
02:38:42,778 --> 02:38:44,871
Hail Lord Krishna!

1588
02:38:45,081 --> 02:38:46,742
Hail absolute truth...

1589
02:38:46,949 --> 02:38:49,509
Hail lord reclining on serpent...

1590
02:38:52,588 --> 02:38:57,025
Hail destroyer of evil...
hail the saviour of poor...

1591
02:38:59,829 --> 02:39:04,289
Hail protector of devotees...
Hail lord of illusion...

1592
02:39:07,269 --> 02:39:14,539
He who hears, sees to writes
about your divine ploys...

1593
02:39:14,744 --> 02:39:23,049
be blessed with prosperity,
