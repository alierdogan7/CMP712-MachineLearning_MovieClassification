1
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,410
There are ballads
that are sad

2
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:28,977
About a lassie
and a lad

3
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:34,288
There are songs about our
heroes and their glories

4
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:38,692
But I'd like
to have you hear

5
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:43,168
About a girl
so sweet and dear

6
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:50,506
So listen to
my sentimental story

7
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,844
My cousin, Agnes Klung,
left home when she was young

8
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,980
I'll tell you how it happened
Let me think

9
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:08,153
She was cute and pretty too
Her eyes were oh, so blue

10
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:12,255
But a single cocktail
made poor Agnes wink

11
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:18,301
It's not funny as you think
when a gal has got to wink

12
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:22,273
Every time she has
a little drink or two

13
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:27,871
One day she got a jug
and she drank it all, ga-lug

14
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:38,247
And she said good-bye and left
us in a stew-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo

15
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:46,231
Well, she got to the city
She was just a little giddy

16
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:50,895
She asked a fella
how to get around

17
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,340
She said "Don't think that I am
fresh but can you tell me an address

18
00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:00,368
Where I can go 'cause
I don't know my way in town"

19
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:07,485
Now the feller was a gent
He knew just what Agnes meant

20
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:12,150
That is until
he saw her start to wink

21
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:16,889
And then he believed and knew
exactly what a guy should do

22
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:20,922
So he suggested that they both
should have a drink

23
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:28,665
Well, he took her by the hand and
then Agnes said, "Ooh, this is grand

24
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:34,111
"But, mister, I'm afraid
you made a big mistake

25
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:39,618
"If you'll just be kind enough
I'd like to stop this silly stuff

26
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,951
Liberties you're not allowed
to take"

27
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:50,024
Now the feller didn't know
about her winkin' eye and so

28
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:54,396
He couldn't figure out
what was the score

29
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:59,598
So he took her out to eat and
to a show right down the street

30
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:04,041
And he asked her if she'd
care for something more

31
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:11,045
Agnes said, "I think you're
swell but will you find me a hotel

32
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:14,951
"Where I can go and not
be bothered by the men

33
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:21,786
"I'm a long, long way from
home and I wanna be alone

34
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:25,592
But perhaps I'll see you
sometime soon again"

35
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:32,635
Now our Agnes wasn't dumb but
back home where she came from

36
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:37,335
She never learned
the value of her wink

37
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:44,839
In the city she got wise
Learned to use her winkin' eyes

38
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:48,876
Now our Agnes
does her drinkin'

39
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,923
In a mink

40
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:59,792
Imagine a kid from the Kentucky hills
doing that to the cream of cafe's society.

41
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:04,735
Who's her agent? I am. I know talent when
I see it. Only good act you brought me.

42
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,898
You haven't seen anything yet. Wait 'til
you see what I've got for you tonight.

43
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:12,468
Now look here, I don't... Don't worry
about a thing. Don't worry about a thing.

44
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,843
Just a minute, friends.
Just a minute.

45
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:18,406
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight is a special
attraction we present for your amazement...

46
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:24,389
Just because he's your agent doesn't mean he
can bring any broken down act into this place.

47
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:27,654
Oh, give him a chance. He has
to get work for his clients...

48
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:30,890
in order to pay me the money
he borrows to feed them.

49
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:34,126
<i>In the annals of the theater,
we've had many great escape artists.</i>

50
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,364
You've heard of the Great Houdini,
Great Bronson, the Great Herman.

51
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,929
Now comes
the Great Wilbert!

52
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,441
Professor,
a chord, please.

53
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:54,920
And now the Great Wilbert will
perform his greatest escape.

54
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:01,820
Music, maestro.

55
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:04,590
Now, if some kind person from the
audience will step on the stage...

56
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,689
and chain him up,
anyone at all?

57
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:10,395
<i>Aw, come on,
anyone?</i>

58
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,564
<i>Don't be bashful.
Step right up on the stage.</i>

59
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,233
<i>- You know, it's a honor to
work with the Great Wilbert.</i>

60
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,300
There's the one...

61
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:22,405
<i>Pardon me, uh...
Wilbert, Wilbert?</i>

62
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:25,815
Hey, come on.
None of that.

63
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:30,652
Outside please, girls. Now, will
some kind person please step up?

64
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:34,284
<i>Anyone?
How about you gentlemen?</i>

65
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,658
Do you think
I can do this?

66
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,197
Just remember what I taught you.
I'll slip you the master key.

67
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:42,826
Keep it in your mouth. When I pull
the drapes, open the locks and escape.

68
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,427
Come right up here.
There you are, boys.

69
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:49,942
Now, tie him. Tie him up as tight
as you can. That's the spirit.

70
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,170
<i>That's it.
That's it, boys.</i>

71
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,646
The Great Wilbert will get
out! I promise you he will.

72
00:06:55,715 --> 00:07:00,414
<i>That's the spirit, boys. That's the way
the Wilbert works,: the Great Wilbert.</i>

73
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:05,150
<i>Yes. Make it tight.
Make it tight. Well, well.</i>

74
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:08,489
We finally found some gentlemen
who really know their business.

75
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:12,759
<i>Oh, 38? Hmm.</i>

76
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,505
Look at him!
Take it! Ooh, you!

77
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:29,037
Now, now... Hey, hey! Go ahead,
complete tying him. Would you...

78
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:33,609
I'll kill both of'em. Oh,
watch your blood pressure.

79
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:36,587
<i>You got him?
There we are.</i>

80
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:43,128
Let him get out of that. I...

81
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:46,563
Here's the key. Open your mouth. Open up!

82
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,499
Good luck, boy.

83
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:56,904
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the Great
Wilbert, in a matter of a few seconds,

84
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:01,276
will shed his bonds
like a snake sheds its skin.

85
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,406
A drum roll,
maestro.

86
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:09,920
<i>And here we have...
Here we have...</i>

87
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:17,456
Fooled ya that time,
didn't I?

88
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,727
Well, uh, can't make
a trick look too easy.

89
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,268
Now, in, uh,
a matter of minutes,

90
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:27,705
<i>the Great Wilbert will
perform his greatest escape.!</i>

91
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:31,470
And here we have...
the Great Wilbert.

92
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:35,640
<i>He's still there.</i>

93
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:38,912
I'll tell ya what. We'll have a
little contest. Look at your watches.

94
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:42,978
The one that can guess how long it'll
take the Great Wilbert to get loose,

95
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:45,421
will be a guest of the house;
now look at your watches.

96
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:51,123
Guest of the house? I'll make those guy's
guests of the hospital. Get out and sing.

97
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:02,771
In the hills ofTennessee
lives a family named McGee

98
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:06,369
<i>They've really got a problem
on their mind</i>

99
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:10,381
<i>For their daughter, Mary-Ann
just can't find herself a man</i>

100
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:14,317
<i>She ain't even been
nobody's valentine</i>

101
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:18,448
<i>Theyjust can't figure out
why some feller roundabout</i>

102
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:22,460
<i>Ain't askin'Mary-Ann
to be his wife</i>

103
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:26,123
- Oooh!
- She'll soon be lookin' old

104
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:29,599
And she'll likely be
an old maid all her life

105
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:33,730
<i>Oh, why don't someone
marry Mary-Ann</i>

106
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:38,004
<i>No gal can shoot a rifle
like she can</i>

107
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:41,808
And what fills her
with dismay

108
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:47,683
- She'll be 12
this Groundhog Day

109
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,950
- Oh, why won't someone
marry Mary-Ann

110
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,820
<i>Whoa-Whoa.!</i>

111
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:57,226
<i>And there he is!
There he is.</i>

112
00:09:57,296 --> 00:10:00,663
A mouse! A mouse!
A mouse!

113
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:05,602
A mouse? Where? Where?
I'll blow his brains out!

114
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:10,106
This is the last time you bring an
act in here! You've ruined my show.

115
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:13,668
Say, where did you learn
that yell? Oh, the yell.

116
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:18,046
<i>Oh, the yell. My grandpappy. He taught me to
yell like that every time I get in trouble.</i>

117
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:23,180
I thought you looked familiar. You
must be a McCoy. That's our clan yell.

118
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:27,123
Well, take your clan and yell outside!
You're through yelling here too.

119
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,097
I'm sorry
I got you fired.

120
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:37,659
Furthermore though, I really don't belong
to the McCoy clan. My name is Wilbert Smith.

121
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:40,205
Wait a minute.
Suppose he was a McCoy?

122
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:44,106
If his grandpa is who I think he is,
he may be worth millions. Millions?

123
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:47,873
Yes. Millions. I'm your
agent; I get ten percent.

124
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:51,405
Ten percent of millions. Uh-uh. Excuse me.

125
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,817
I mean, after all, who did you
sign a contract with? Wilbert Smith.

126
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:58,516
Hiya, stranger. Shake
hands with a McCoy. Hey!

127
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,889
Just don't raise your hand... Hey!

128
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,292
That's my grandpappy
on the bottom.

129
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:07,799
Well, that's Squeeze Box McCoy. Why,
he's even playing his concertina.

130
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:11,030
Looks like I found
myself a new cousin. Uh...

131
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:14,869
Ohhh. I was never cousins before
with a beautiful girl like this.

132
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,068
How do you figure he's
coming into a million dollars?

133
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:22,171
Well, except for me, Squeeze Box is the
only member of the clan who left the hills.

134
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,182
Oh, no. There must be some mistake.

135
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:29,278
All my grandpappy ever left me was a fur
cap and a concertina. That's all. No money.

136
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,823
Then why all
the excitement?

137
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:35,383
Well, somewhere in the hills of
Kentucky, there's a buried treasure.

138
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,953
And my Great Granny McCoy said
that it would only be discovered...

139
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,467
<i>when a Squeeze Box
McCoy returned.</i>

140
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:46,972
<i>Now, if Wilbert went back with this
picture... And this concertina and fur cap.</i>

141
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,837
Hey. Then they would think
he's the real McCoy.

142
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:53,538
With all that evidence, Granny might give you
the secret. I forgot to tell you one thing.

143
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:57,207
Grandpappy also left me this
old gun. No! It's apt to go off.

144
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:00,912
Oh, no, it ain't loaded.
Look. Ah, will you stop that!

145
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,739
Why don't you look
where you're going?

146
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:31,942
Why do I have to walk through the
wilderness? Why don't they have roads?

147
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:35,953
Now, stop complaining. Dorothy's taking
a short cut. Go pick up the grips.

148
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:38,922
Pick up the grips!

149
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:56,672
You know, I've never been
in the country before.

150
00:12:56,742 --> 00:13:00,542
Ah, smell that
Kentucky bluegrass.

151
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,343
If grass smells like this,
no wonder it's blue.

152
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:08,944
Oh, Kentucky. Kentucky: where they
raise the fastest horses in the world.

153
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:12,957
There must be something in the
air that makes those horses run.

154
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:16,586
<i>There's something in this air
that would make anybody run.</i>

155
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:20,928
The birth place of Stephen Foster.
His songs will live forever.

156
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,492
I'm a-comin'

157
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,664
And I'm a-going

158
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,901
Uh-Uh, wait a minute.

159
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,944
I'm comin'

160
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:38,109
For my head
is bending low

161
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:41,210
Uh-huh. You smell it? No,
I don't smell anything.

162
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,847
Then your head ain't bending
low enough. I... Wait a minute.

163
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:47,086
Hey, there's something wrong
with that grip.

164
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,151
Open it up!

165
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,959
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

166
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:56,433
Hey, that fur cap, did
that have legs? What?

167
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,595
No. Wait a minute. It has now.

168
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,662
I don't understand.
Whoa!

169
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:03,606
<i>Whoa-Whoa-whoo.!</i>

170
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:08,375
Don't yell like that again. This
is Winfield territory. Winfield?

171
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:12,611
Yes, you see, your grandpappy shot his
first Winfield to revenge a McCoy killing.

172
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,916
Well, that started the feud. One
killing led to another until...

173
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,956
Well, look.

174
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,890
<i>What's that? That's the
Winfield burying ground.</i>

175
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,088
We have to pass through that to reach
McCoy territory. Yes, ma'am. See ya later.

176
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,597
Wha... Come here. Come here.

177
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:29,190
I don... I just... Come on, come on!

178
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:37,471
If these guys are all dead, why don't
they lay down? They're only wooden.

179
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:41,206
That's an old custom
here in the hills. Yeah?

180
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:47,312
Wood. You'd like to scare
the wits right out of me.

181
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,786
That's Jake Winfield.

182
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:54,986
"Killed in 1882
by Squeeze Box McCoy. "

183
00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:00,123
You-You mean to tell me that Squeeze
Box McCoy knocked off all these others?

184
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:04,101
That's right. No-No-No wonder
they had it in for my grandpappy.

185
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:08,265
And if they ever found out that a
relative of Squeeze Box McCoy's is back,

186
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,241
<i>the whole feud might start
all over again.</i>

187
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:16,714
Well, in case anyone's listening,
I'm Al Stewart, I'm not a McCoy!

188
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:19,342
<i>I'm Al Stewart,
I'm not a McCoy.!</i>

189
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:23,411
<i>I'm Wilbert Smith!
You look like a McCoy.!</i>

190
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,083
That did it.
Get away.

191
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,728
Don't hold me.
Go get your grip.

192
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:33,287
Oh.
Go ahead!

193
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,510
That real?
Sure.

194
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,842
Yee!

195
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:25,813
From here on in,
it's McCoy territory.

196
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,512
You mean, we'ns is home?
That's right, Cousin.

197
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:32,887
McCoy territory. I'd like to see
a Winfield put foot in here. I'd...

198
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,552
<i>Whoa!</i>

199
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,991
<i>Hi, you all.</i>

200
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:44,092
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!

201
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,935
Howdy, folks. Well, what do
you know, it's Cousin Dorothy.

202
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,844
Doggone, look at them
store-bought clothes.

203
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:59,282
What brings ya back, Cousin?
What are ya here for, Dorothy?

204
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,581
I came to see Granny.
Where is she?

205
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:05,214
Where do you think she'd be,
plowin' the field?

206
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:09,056
Not when there's a county fair
goin' on. Howdy, child.

207
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:12,256
Gee, it's good to see you.
I brought you back a surprise.

208
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:20,261
Wilbert? Wilbert. Come here. I
want you to meet your kinfolks.

209
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:24,139
Howdy. Hey, you a soldier? Yup.

210
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,803
What do you hear about the
war situation? Last I hear it,

211
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:30,542
Grant had Lee tied up
at Richmond.

212
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:34,017
How come I didn't read about that
in the newspapers? Oh, Wilbert!

213
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,213
Granny, I found him
in New York.

214
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:39,257
<i>You found that?</i>

215
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:42,760
He's not a husband, Granny.
He's a cousin of ours.

216
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,626
He's the grandson
of Squeeze Box McCoy.

217
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,824
Squeeze Box McCoy.

218
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,165
Hallelujah!
My prayers is answered.

219
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,171
He don't look like
what I prayed for.

220
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:59,768
<i>I guess if you ask the Lord for lean meat
and get fat, a person should be satisfied.</i>

221
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:03,110
Oh, he's a real McCoy,
all right. I saw the evidence.

222
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:07,676
I'm his friend, Al Stewart. Uh,
Wilbert, show your granny the picture.

223
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,290
That's Squeeze Box all right.

224
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,623
Tarnation.

225
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:21,860
Wait 'til the Winfields get the word. The
county fair'll shine like Fourth ofJuly.

226
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,426
County fair, and the
Fourth ofJuly, all together?

227
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,699
Boy,
and what fun!

228
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:32,642
<i>And what blood running all over
the fairgrounds. Clem, Luke.</i>

229
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:35,043
Shut up! If you're scared, go back home.

230
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:39,414
Hold on a minute, Granny. Thought
I was head of this here clan.

231
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:43,285
You were, but a Squeeze Box is back. Hmm.

232
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:45,789
Don't look like
no Squeeze Box to me.

233
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,691
Do he, Cousins?
Well, he don't to me.

234
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,060
<i>Must a been the last of
the litter. Why, neighbors,</i>

235
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,999
you see before you
a born leader.

236
00:18:56,068 --> 00:19:00,164
And to prove to you
that he is what he claims he is,

237
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:03,470
here's his grandpappy's
concertina.

238
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,567
Gimme that!

239
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:12,043
That's his squeeze box
all right. That's him for sure.

240
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:16,781
Listen, you'ns, you hear me tell that if a
Squeeze Box McCoy ever come back to these hills,

241
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,914
the treasure'd be found.

242
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,654
Well, your Cousin Wilbert's
worth his weight in gold.

243
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:25,526
So make sure
nothin' happens to him.

244
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:28,065
Are you McCoys
to be took in...

245
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:32,001
by a couple of...
city slickers?

246
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:37,064
Supposin' Dorothy was blabbin' off her mouth
in some of them saloons she's been a-singin' in.

247
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:40,168
Mightin' ya find an old picture
and a squeeze box...

248
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:42,679
and come here to fool
an old woman.

249
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,513
Nobody calls me an old woman,
and nobody fools me.

250
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:52,523
Now I didn't mean to rile ya, Granny,
but I still say let 'em "betest" it.

251
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,992
That's "fahr". If he's a
real McCoy, let him prove it.

252
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:59,690
He can do that at the turkey-shoot
today. A real kin of Squeeze Box...

253
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:03,462
<i>will outshoot the best of
the McCoys or the Winfields.</i>

254
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:07,938
And if he can't shoot at all, the Winfields'll
laugh us right out of the fairgrounds.

255
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,644
Your shoot,
Cousin.

256
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,183
You just...

257
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:24,853
Hey, Al, how-how do you
work one of these here?

258
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:27,255
<i>You pull the trigger.</i>

259
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:58,687
That's him.
The little fat feller.

260
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:06,524
Been hearin' that
a Squeeze Box is back.

261
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:12,298
Thar he is. You mean he's
a kin of Squeeze Box McCoy?

262
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:15,272
I'm Wilbert.
Wilbert?

263
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,743
Ha! A critter with a name like that
ain't worth startin' a feud over.

264
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:23,269
But if you's aimin' to get
fractious... Look here, Devil Dan,

265
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,511
for 60 years we've been
soft-walkin' McCoys,

266
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:29,076
now our feet
don't hurt no more.

267
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:33,147
And if you'n make one move,
we'ns will tromp all over ya!

268
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:37,594
We'ns is gonna meet at that
turkey-shoot and decide things.

269
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:40,564
And don't you forget
to bring your shootin' iron,

270
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,532
Wi-i-i-ilbert!

271
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:48,972
I "knowed" no Winfield'd pay
respect to a name like "Wilbert. "

272
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:55,210
Then we'll christen him after his
grandpappy and call him Squeeze Box.

273
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,977
You're right, Granny.
Let's have us a christenin'.

274
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:03,078
Appears to me, he's a
little big for a christenin'.

275
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,056
Well, they christen
battleships and they're big.

276
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:11,084
Calem, you do the christenin'.
Take off your hats.

277
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:16,465
Bow your head, Wilbert. I now
christen thee Squeeze Box McCoy.

278
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:28,936
He sure is "purty,"
ain't he?

279
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:42,482
On the outskirts of our town
lived a gal named Sadie Brown

280
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:46,224
They say she's makin' money
by the peck

281
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:50,325
For the simple country maid
landed on the Hit Parade

282
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:53,997
In a manner
that we never did expect

283
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:58,168
Unlike any of her kin she
grew whiskers on her chin

284
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:01,269
And her sideburns caused
the neighbors to remark

285
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:05,976
<i>Through no effort ofher own
soon her beard became full-grown</i>

286
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,543
Now they've got her
on display in Central Park

287
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:13,921
They call her Sagebrush Sadie
The famous bearded lady

288
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:17,655
Her whiskers brought her
riches and renown

289
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:21,665
They're the pride of the museum
and it costs two-bits to see 'em

290
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:25,225
And the family's gettin' rich
on Sadie Brown

291
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:29,706
She started runnin' 'round
with a barber in the town

292
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:33,267
And the fellow seemed
to have an awful crush

293
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:37,543
But it's easy to explain
why she drove the man insane

294
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:41,279
For Sadie had the skin
you love to brush

295
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:45,346
Her barber friend proposed
just as everyone's supposed

296
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:49,087
But the way he did it
made her kind of vexed

297
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:52,756
He'd been married twice before
and the thing that made her sore

298
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:55,994
Was when he rode up to
her gate and hollered "Next"

299
00:23:56,067 --> 00:24:01,164
She consented with a smile and
he led her down the aisle

300
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:04,436
In the chapel where
the mornin' glories bloom

301
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:08,969
But poor ol' Parson Trout
couldn't get it figured out

302
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:12,574
So he shook hands with the
bride and kissed the groom

303
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:17,145
They call her Sagebrush Sadie
The famous bearded lady

304
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:20,749
She's happy that she's wed
and settled down

305
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:23,795
For her little baby daughter

306
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:26,922
Has a moustache
like an otter

307
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,428
She's the image
of her mother, Sadie Brown

308
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:54,352
You broke your promise Oh,
yes, you broke your promise

309
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:59,329
And now I'm all alone and
blue I'm so alone without you

310
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:04,061
You said you loved me Oh,
yes, you said you loved me

311
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:08,868
And not a word you said
was true What did I do

312
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,671
- You promised
you'd be mine forever

313
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:16,874
<i>I didn't know you heard it And
we would never never, ever part</i>

314
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:18,643
<i>It must've been
my brother</i>

315
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:23,279
But you broke your promise
Oh, yes, you broke your promise

316
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:27,485
And that is how you broke
my heart

317
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:33,464
My darling, don't dispair
There's still another chorus

318
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:42,974
I wish I had a nickel every
time that she was fickle

319
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:52,946
There's no mirror on his shelf
He's so mean he hates himself

320
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:57,079
Promise you'll be mine
forever

321
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,783
And we will never
never, ever part

322
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:03,521
Nothin' left for me to say
Come on, Wilbert, start to play

323
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:16,269
You broke your promise Oh,
yes, you broke your promise

324
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:21,210
And now I'm all alone and blue
2-3-4-5-6-7-8

325
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,943
You said you loved me Oh,
yes, you said you loved me

326
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:30,818
<i>- And not a word you said
was true, 7-6-5-4-3-2</i>

327
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:35,622
You promised you'd be mine
forever and ever and ever

328
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:40,654
And we would never
ever part

329
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:45,669
<i>But you broke your promise
Oh, yes, you broke your promise</i>

330
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:50,333
And that is how
you broke my heart

331
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,933
<i>Yes, that is how you broke
That is how you</i>

332
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:55,377
<i>That is how you
That is how you</i>

333
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,381
<i>That is how you broke</i>

334
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:01,385
<i>My heart
My heart</i>

335
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,618
Thanks for the songs,
Miss McCoy.

336
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:15,530
I didn't expect to see the Manhattan
Hillbilly so far from Tin Pan Alley.

337
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,127
Tin Pan Alley? That's no hillbilly
talk. You must be a "fereigner. "

338
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:21,297
I was born here,
my folks moved north.

339
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,739
But where music is concerned,
I'm still a hillbilly.

340
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:27,300
I'm down here trying to find some real
mountain music that hasn't been commercialized.

341
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:30,974
The name is Winfield.
Clark Winfield.

342
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:34,849
A Winfield directing a
McCoy? Well, sure now, ma'am.

343
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,888
You don't cotton to that there
feudin' nonsense, do ya?

344
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:42,757
I don't if you don't, partner? Even
if I did, I'd make an exception to you.

345
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:46,490
Any exception to seeing the fair? Let's go.

346
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:51,092
Get your hot roasted peanuts, carmels,
crackerjacks, cigars... What'll you have?

347
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:55,128
Oh, lemonade,
please.

348
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:58,471
Make it two.

349
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:00,943
How 'bout a hot dog?
No, I don't want a hot dog.

350
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:04,539
These hot dogs are different. Everybody
sells 'em with a pickle in the middle.

351
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:08,052
Now, what happens? You eat 'em, you get
mustard all over you. Now, we're different.

352
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:12,146
We put the frankfurter in there, mustard
in the middle. Mustard in the middle.

353
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:17,217
There we are. Pickle on top. No fuss,
no muss, no napkins, there you are.

354
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,470
Well, you ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

355
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:38,175
First, you're stuffing your face with pie,
and now you're loading yourself with hot dogs.

356
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:42,185
Now you know why I don't like mustard.
It's your turn at the turkey-shoot.

357
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:46,587
And we've gotta beat those Winfields.
You know I don't know how to shoot a gun.

358
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:50,094
Didn't you learn how to shoot in
the army? I was in the cavalry.

359
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:53,528
What kind of bullets come out of
a pitchfork? All right, listen.

360
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:56,499
You stay here. I'll go
and fix it up for you.

361
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,137
How 'bout
another hot dog?

362
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,479
Howdy, Mr. Winfield. I ain't no Winfield.

363
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:14,450
Good. How would you
like to make a dollar?

364
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:19,047
Just name your man. All I want is for my
fat friend there to win the turkey-shoot.

365
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:24,084
All you have to do is get behind some big rock
or something. There's a big tree down there.

366
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:27,962
Good! As long as you
make it a bull's-eye.

367
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:37,064
Hey, how'd you like to make 50 cents? How?

368
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:41,704
When the little fat city feller goes up
there to shoot, just make sure he wins.

369
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:59,054
Jed, how'd you like to pick
up ten cents? Ten cents.

370
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,223
How do I get it?

371
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:05,736
Be sure that little fat city
feller wins the turkey-shoot.

372
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:17,646
Wanna make five cents?
Sure.

373
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:19,910
Here.

374
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:26,580
I've got it all set. I've got a guy to shoot
from behind the tree the same time you do.

375
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:30,094
Can you trust the guy? Can you trust
him. You don't know these mountain folks.

376
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:33,528
They're as honest as the day is
long. The days here are gettin' short.

377
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,931
Oh, please. Come on, come
on. Come on, come on, come on!

378
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:50,110
Just a squirrel twitch outside.
So far, the Winfields has got it.

379
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:53,776
We'ns is ahead.

380
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:58,983
All you'ns got left is Wilbert and he
apt to hit a hog in the next county.

381
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:02,925
Start shootin', Squeeze Box.

382
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:15,670
All right, fella,
when I say "Fire," fire.

383
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,176
Get ready.
Fire.

384
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,143
Fire.

385
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:30,312
Al, am I behind
the right tree?

386
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:33,721
Will you stop fooling
and aim at the target.

387
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,389
Squeeze Box.

388
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:46,096
I came to help ya.

389
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,139
Well, if'n you're
gonna shoot, shoot.

390
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:54,507
Take aim. When I say,
"Fire," pull the trigger.

391
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:58,640
Fire.

392
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,116
The McCoy's win!

393
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:08,158
<i>He is a real McCoy.!</i>

394
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:11,491
First turkey-shoot
we've won in 30 years!

395
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:15,123
And you done it
by cheatin'!

396
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:20,262
<i>You can't shoot nine shots
from a single-bullet rifle gun.</i>

397
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:24,138
Who says I can't?
I do!

398
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:26,142
Okay.

399
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:30,010
Just like you McCoys to be sneaky
and underhanded behind our backs!

400
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:34,609
Behind your backs? Every McCoy that
a Winfield shot was shot in the back.

401
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:38,782
- You shot our kin.
- Yeah, but we shot 'em when they was lookin'.

402
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:43,725
<i>That's what you say,
old woman.</i>

403
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:48,289
- Don't you "old woman" me.
- Winfields!

404
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:51,961
<i>Hey, where you all runnin' to?
Ain't ya gonna wait for the turkey?</i>

405
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:55,233
Me neither.
Yeee!

406
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:07,910
Granny, how 'bout tellin' where the
treasure is before something happens?

407
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,786
Nothin's gonna happen. My rheumatism
tells me the rains is gonna come...

408
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:14,256
and spoil this
whole durn feud.

409
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:28,736
Balls of fire!
They usin' heavy artillery!

410
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:33,775
Just like'n you said, Granny.
We tromped all over 'em.

411
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:37,679
We sure made 'em hightail it.
They sure scared of us now.

412
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,377
Us McCoys sure got 'em.

413
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:53,563
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

414
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:56,794
How could my kinfolks ever
live in a joint like this?

415
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:00,861
Probably your forefathers
lived here. Beg your pardon.

416
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:03,907
I say, probably your forefathers
lived here before you.

417
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:06,136
My forefathers?
Well, sure.

418
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,838
I didn't have no forefathers.
Well, sure you did.

419
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:12,371
If I did, only one come
home nights. Go on, stupid!

420
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,975
<i>You...
Boy, listen to that rain.</i>

421
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:19,490
But it was nice of Uncle Clem to put
us up like this. Well, I'll sleep here.

422
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:22,082
Oh, no you don't. This is
my bed. You sleep over there.

423
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,687
And, uh, who is going to make me? Me.

424
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:28,197
Squeeze Box McCoy.
Hmm.

425
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:31,895
And if I can't,
my kin can.

426
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:36,963
Well, go ahead. Your head's getting so big,
there ain't room in the bed for both of us.

427
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:53,681
What a night.

428
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,454
Sure is a-pourin' out.

429
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,893
Well, squeeze over,
Squeeze Box.

430
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:12,771
Good night.

431
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:18,281
Hooo.

432
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,945
Rain sure is cold.

433
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:25,648
I could use a warm spot.
Shift over, Unc.

434
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:28,920
Squeeze over,
Squeeze Box.

435
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:43,297
Hey, Luke,
who's that on the end?

436
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:48,635
That's Wilbert.
One of Squeeze Box's kin.

437
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:52,407
My brother, Zeke.

438
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,974
Welcome, Cousin.

439
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:58,021
Roll, Luke.

440
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,455
Shift, Unc.

441
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:03,961
Squeeze over,
Squeeze Box.

442
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:23,847
Howdy, Cousin.

443
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:32,955
Ain't a fit night out
for man nor beast.

444
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:36,050
Howdy, Noah.

445
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:39,927
Feller on the end
is a kin o' Squeeze Box.

446
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:44,400
Well, pleased to meet ya.
Always got room for kith and kin.

447
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:46,402
Sashay over, Zeke.

448
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,997
Roll, Luke.
Shift, Unc.

449
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:51,974
Squeeze over,
Squeeze Box.

450
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:05,814
Funny-lookin' dogs
down here. Heh-heh.

451
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,222
Excuse me.

452
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:15,197
When we get inside,
let me do the talking.

453
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:18,258
Who needs you? I'm the
new head man around here.

454
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:21,032
It's too bad the new head
isn't better than the old one.

455
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:23,005
Now, look...
Go on!

456
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:29,337
It's about time you'ns got
here. What is this all about?

457
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,574
Calem's got more questions to ask.

458
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:35,585
<i>We answered all the questions.
How about the jackpot?</i>

459
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:38,486
Thar goes
the still again.

460
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,958
Luke, how many times
I got to tell ya...

461
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:47,623
not to put too much
sugar in the squeezin's?

462
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:51,759
Calem, get on with your talk
so Luke can get the still fixed.

463
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:53,770
All right, Granny.

464
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:02,443
How many chill'un you got,
Squeeze Box?

465
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:05,505
I don't have any children.

466
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:09,542
No chill'un, huh?
How long ya been married?

467
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:13,890
I'm, I'm not married.

468
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:19,294
Thar. No wives, no
chill'un. And him, over 16.

469
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:21,797
He don't deserve to be head
of this here clan.

470
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:24,494
There's a lot
in what Calem says.

471
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:29,870
Squeeze Box, maybe you better get hitched 'fore
I let on as to the whar'bout's the treasure.

472
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:35,242
There's no problem for that. Wilbert must
know of some girl he's taken a likin' to.

473
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,247
Oh, sure.

474
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,249
Knew it.

475
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:42,883
Dorothy.
She kissed me once.

476
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:46,753
<i>She did?
Mm-hmm.</i>

477
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:51,955
Squeeze Box, you and your friend go outside
while we'ns has a little recommendin'.

478
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:57,023
Recommendin'? What's that? It's an old hill
custom. They're going to pick you a bride.

479
00:38:57,101 --> 00:39:00,298
Can't I pick my own? Don't
try to buck traditions.

480
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,033
Marriage is a gamble.
It's like shooting dice.

481
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:07,476
But I'm gettin' faded before I
even make a pass! Come on outside.

482
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:09,706
I-I'm...
Never mind.

483
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:15,274
Why haven't I the right to pick my
wife? 'Cause you're dumb enough...

484
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,914
to pick a girl too young for
ya. What's age got to do with it?

485
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:23,619
Everything. Say you're 40 and you're
in love with a girl ten years old.

486
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:27,824
This one's a pip. I'm goin' out with
a ten-year-old. Wait. Just a minute.

487
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:31,334
Got a good idea where I'm gonna
wind up. Zoom! Wait. All right!

488
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:34,428
You're 40. She's ten.
You couldn't marry her.

489
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:37,474
Not unless I came from these
hills. Leave the hills out of it!

490
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,977
You're 40, she's ten. You're
four times as old as that girl.

491
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,845
You wait five years. Now
the girl is 15, you're 45.

492
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:49,545
Now you're only three times as
old. So, you wait 15 years more.

493
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:53,351
Now the girl is 30 and you're 60.
You're only twice as old as that girl.

494
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:56,416
She's catchin' up. Sure!
Now here's the question:

495
00:39:56,494 --> 00:40:00,328
How long do you have to wait before
you and the girl are the same age?

496
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,424
Oh. Take your time and think it over.

497
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:06,095
No, no, no... What's
ridiculous? That's ridiculous!

498
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:10,197
If I keep waitin' for that girl,
she'll wind up older than me.

499
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:13,300
She'll have to wait for me.
Why should she wait for you?

500
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:18,076
I was nice enough to wait for her! If
she wants to marry me, she'll wait for me.

501
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:20,174
Marry you? Do you know the girl? No.

502
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,379
Why marry a girl you don't know?
That's what I'm tryin' to tell ya.

503
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:26,355
Why haven't I a right
pick my wife?

504
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,824
Stay here while they
do the recommending.

505
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:33,023
I'm not gonna argue about Wilbert
anymore. I think he's sweet, but...

506
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:37,124
But you're fixed on someone else.
That tune-collectin' Winfield!

507
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:41,137
That's my business. I don't see
what this has to do with Wilbert.

508
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:46,541
You're not keeping your promise. You're
not keeping your head! A Winfield!

509
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,238
<i>We're wastin'our time.</i>

510
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:54,774
I gives ya the blushin' bride
to be: my own sister, Matt.

511
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:58,652
You're right, Calem.
She's now on to 14.

512
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:02,624
Ain't no sense in her being
an old maid. That's right.

513
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:04,718
Oh, Calem.

514
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:09,323
Dorothy, better tell
Cousin Squeeze Box. Yes'm.

515
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:15,498
And I'm off to tell
the marryin'judge.

516
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:18,508
Ooh!

517
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:20,908
You sure are a lucky man. I am?

518
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:25,847
Dorothy'll tell ya all about
it. Maybe she changed her mind.

519
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:31,081
Wilbert, I want to talk
to you... alone. Oh.

520
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:35,883
Dorothy, Calem told me
what a lucky fellow I am.

521
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,520
He told you? Good. He did.

522
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:41,963
The wedding's
tomorrow morning.

523
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:45,468
Would you like to take
a walk in the moonlight?

524
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:48,266
I can't.
I have a date tonight.

525
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:52,742
You have a date tonight and
the wedding is in the morning?

526
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:57,474
Why, yes. And I have a date
tomorrow night with the same fellow.

527
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:03,516
Where will I be tomorrow night?
You'll be on your honeymoon.

528
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:10,325
I'll be on my honeymoon...
while you're on a date?

529
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:12,988
Yes.
Is something wrong?

530
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:18,464
Are you worried
about the wedding?

531
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:25,231
No, but it doesn't sound as
nice as you read it in the books.

532
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:28,904
Wilbert, Luke just told
me. He knows about it too?

533
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:32,813
Al, will you give the bride
away? Calem's gonna do that.

534
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:36,614
He's been tryin'
to get rid of her for years.

535
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:43,556
Listen you, you stop insultin' the
future Mrs. Squeeze Box McCoy, or...

536
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:47,927
Oh, Squeeze Box, darlin'.
Fightin' for me already!

537
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:49,966
Fightin' for you?

538
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:52,161
After all,
you two are engaged.

539
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:57,105
Dorothy, you mean that you
and I is really me and him,

540
00:42:57,174 --> 00:43:01,668
and that him is a her? That's
what I've been trying to tell you.

541
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:06,512
Ooh. All this time
I thought him was a him.

542
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:10,953
Uncle Clem's takin' me to town
for a real store-bought dress.

543
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:15,788
Dorothy, will you come along and help me
pick out a real city-kind of bridal veil?

544
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:20,228
Well, anything for the future
Mrs. Squeeze Box. Come on.

545
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:22,231
Ee-yoo-ooh!

546
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:28,902
Al, you gotta get me outta this. Wait a
minute. I can't interfere in these things.

547
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:30,907
I'm a "fereigner. "

548
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:35,205
Oh. Look, you.

549
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:40,182
You gotta do somethin' to get me outta
this. Like it or not, you're a groom.

550
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,775
Yeah, but look
what I'm stuck with.

551
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:46,721
Yeah, they wanted me to hitch
up with Matt a year back.

552
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:50,385
Why didn't you? Got kicked
in the head by a mule.

553
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:54,557
I'm a little "tetched" now,
but I ain't that crazy.

554
00:43:55,633 --> 00:44:00,002
Um, where's the stable
with the mule?

555
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,004
Down yonder.

556
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:07,009
He ain't all there!

557
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:10,706
<i>Calem, you sure made Matt happy.</i>

558
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:13,944
When do you suppose we're
gonna learn Granny's secret?

559
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:18,819
At the celebration. Granny'll tell
Squeeze Box where the treasure's hid,

560
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:22,757
<i>and Matt'll make him tell us. You
gonna kill him for the celebration?</i>

561
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:26,284
<i>No, wait until after the
weddin'. Then slaughter 'im.</i>

562
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:30,060
<i>Hey, you can use my knife
to slit his throat.</i>

563
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:34,503
He's sure gonna make an elegant
weddin' dinner. You gonna grind 'im up?

564
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:38,302
<i>No, gonna roast 'im and
put an apple in his mouth.</i>

565
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:45,847
<i>Al.! Al.!</i>

566
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:48,544
Granny! Al!

567
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:52,646
What's the matter? My kin ain't
mountain folks. They're cannibals.

568
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:56,682
What are you talking about? Calem
said he was gonna cut my throat,

569
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,959
and cook me. They was talkin' about
the pig for the weddin' dinner tonight.

570
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:06,162
Oh. Eh? Squeeze Box, come
inside. I wanna talk to you.

571
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:11,238
Sit down by the fire.

572
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:17,713
Oh, thank you.

573
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:21,843
Mm!

574
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:26,015
Squeeze Box, you're not much to look
at, but you got your good points.

575
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:29,082
And it's a durn shame
Dorothy don't see 'em.

576
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:32,424
And I'm gonna be rich
soon too. I'm "fer" ya.

577
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:37,160
But she's got her mind set on a no
-'count, mealymouthed Winfield.

578
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:42,262
There's just one thing to do:
get a love potion. Love potion?

579
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:45,900
Is that better than gettin'
kicked in the head by a mule?

580
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:50,913
A love potion from old Aunt Hetty
the witch. One drop in Dorothy's cup,

581
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:56,920
and she'll fall madly in love with the first
man she meets after she drinks it. Yeah?

582
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:59,285
A love potion?

583
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:02,587
Dorothy?

584
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,786
Granny!
Granny!

585
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:16,972
See ya later.

586
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,100
Hey, hey. Wait a minute. I'm scared.

587
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:25,615
You dragged me out here. That big
talk about witches and love potions.

588
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:29,812
I'm gonna prove what a superstitious
idiot you are. Get over there!

589
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:34,790
No, don't! Wait, Al. If you should see a
pair of gray pants flyin' by, don't grab 'em.

590
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:37,588
Why not? Go ahead! I'll be in 'em.

591
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,667
Did you see it?
See what?

592
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:51,367
That was only a bat. You started this and
you're going to finish it. Knock on the door.

593
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:54,638
I wanna go home.
Knock on the door!

594
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,750
Well, nobody home. Let's
go. We'll wait inside.

595
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:18,462
In hope she don't give me the evil
eye. There's nothing to be afraid of.

596
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:21,470
Just a simple,
humble cabin.

597
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:38,113
<i>Cheerful fireplace.
Above it, a departed friend.</i>

598
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:47,561
<i>Huh? The home of a poor old woman who uses
hocus pocus to fool the mountain folks.</i>

599
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:56,765
<i>I hope she don't show up.</i>

600
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:02,301
<i>There's nothing to be afeard
of. I've been waitin'for you.</i>

601
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:06,179
What do you all want?
He wants a love potion.

602
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:09,651
A love potion, dearie?

603
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:14,054
Aunt Hetty's Elixir of Love
never fails. How much do you want?

604
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:16,058
How much is it?

605
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:20,392
Cross my palm with silver. The
more it is, the stronger it gets.

606
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:24,525
Five dollars buys a powerful
potion. Al, give her $5.

607
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:27,968
Wait a minute. I want to see if
it works. You doubt my powers?

608
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:31,098
Not me, him!
I'll show ya.

609
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:35,340
Beelzebub, a fire!

610
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:40,915
Watch this, yes!

611
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:55,229
What's she doin'?
She's molding.

612
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:57,824
This time of the year?
This ti...

613
00:48:57,901 --> 00:49:00,267
She's making voodoo.

614
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:02,965
<i>She's making
vous do what?</i>

615
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,235
Voodoo!
I do?

616
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:08,836
Not you do, voodoo.
I do what?

617
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:12,177
She's making
voodoo magic.

618
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:15,810
She's making voodoo magic? Yeah.

619
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:19,982
Do you know voodoo? You do? Sure! Sure.

620
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:22,821
Tell me more about 'im. Oh, quiet!

621
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:28,490
Sardoo-lee lagumi,
a-gitchy gazoo!

622
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:32,501
Look what she's makin'. That's... Effigy.

623
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:37,597
I don't know what letter it starts with,
but that's beginning to look like me.

624
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:39,642
Shh, quiet!

625
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:48,817
Sardoo-lee legachi,
lagumi gazoo!

626
00:49:48,885 --> 00:49:52,480
Presto!

627
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:54,524
<i>Ouch.!</i>

628
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:57,617
Now, give me
the money.

629
00:49:57,694 --> 00:50:01,755
Not 'til we get the potion.
She can't stick us for $5.

630
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:05,768
Oo-ooh! She can too.
Pay her the money.

631
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,566
Not 'til we get
the potion.

632
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:10,833
Oh!

633
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:15,207
That's just in your mind. You
got a poor sense of direction.

634
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:17,906
Please, pay her
the money.

635
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:20,609
All right.

636
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:24,916
Now that we understand each
other, I'll get the potion.

637
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:52,179
Potion, potion, magic be. Make
her love the first she'll see.

638
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:17,369
There. There'll be a small
deposit of $5 on the jug.

639
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:19,671
I'm not gonna
pay it.

640
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:23,804
You'll pay it or you'll suffer.
I've got you in my power. Oh, no! No!

641
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,814
O-O-Ow!

642
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:29,079
And I got you. Mm!

643
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:35,256
That wasn't fair!

644
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:37,919
Mm!

645
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:40,019
Stop!

646
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:44,830
Mm!

647
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,377
I'll quit
if you will!

648
00:51:58,248 --> 00:52:02,309
Give me that thing! Oh, no.
Not 'til you give me that one.

649
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:12,653
Uh-uh! Not 'til I get the deposit
on the jug. Al, give her the money.

650
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:16,563
I'll pay her when I feel like
it, and I... I feel like it!

651
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:28,308
Ow-ooh-ooh!
Aw, come on.

652
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,077
Wait a minute. She must be a
witch. What's the matter? Why?

653
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:36,779
Look at that broom. That's
what she makes her visits on.

654
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:39,219
That's the kind of broom
I see in fairy tales. Nah.

655
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:42,315
Hey! A windshield
and a wiper.

656
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:45,828
That's for rainy nights. Are you kiddin'?

657
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:49,161
Oh, boy! Get a load of
it. What do you mean?

658
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:51,826
I still don't believe it. There it is!

659
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:53,870
I wonder if it works.

660
00:52:56,706 --> 00:53:00,267
It does!
This must be the starter.

661
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:23,525
Oh! I'm sorry.

662
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:33,165
Wait a minute. I wonder if I'm a
heel doing this? What's the matter?

663
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:37,339
I'd do the same thing. Sure.
You would? Now I know I'm a heel.

664
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:39,382
Ahh, go on!

665
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:42,851
Squeeze Box.

666
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,954
Granny, I got it.

667
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:49,856
You better move fast. Winfield's
making friends with everybody,

668
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:52,793
and he's doin' pretty
durn good with Dorothy.

669
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:56,229
Get busy with that love
potion. Thanks, Granny.

670
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,301
Dorothy, may I
talk to you alone?

671
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:04,067
Certainly, Wilbert. Excuse me, Clark. Sure.

672
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:14,249
What's on your mind, Wilbert?
Dorothy, you gotta do me a favor.

673
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:18,720
If you marry me, then I can get rid of Matt,
or else I'll have to resort to this jug.

674
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:23,521
Wilbert, drink never solved any
problem. Besides, my heart is elsewhere.

675
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:26,357
You mean you didn't bring
it with ya? Oh, Wilbert!

676
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:29,990
Let's throw the jug away. First,
will you drink a toast to my wedding?

677
00:54:30,066 --> 00:54:32,000
Sure.
Good.

678
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:40,469
How about you? I don't need any potion.

679
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:45,480
Potion? I mean, I don't need
any potion of "thet" thar stuff.

680
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:48,574
You certainly picked up
the hillbilly talk.

681
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:52,349
Well, here's luck
to you.

682
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:07,394
Howdy, Cousin.

683
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,904
Works!

684
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:15,434
<i>I have the strangest feeling
I've never had before.</i>

685
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:18,709
Quite suddenly
you seem to be

686
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:22,548
The one that I adore

687
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:25,213
My heart is not
a plaything

688
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:28,416
So handle it with care

689
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:32,689
Without a doubt
if you walk out

690
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:38,064
Then you had best beware

691
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:44,066
You'll be just another notch
on Father's shotgun

692
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:47,337
If'n you don't marry me

693
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:52,006
So if you'd rather be dead
than blissfully wed

694
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:55,677
Don't get that ring
you promised me last spring

695
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:59,688
Now, Pa hardly ever misses

696
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:03,385
When he draws that gat
from his hip

697
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:06,793
And you have your choice
of kisses

698
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:10,799
Or a slug of lead
in the lip

699
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:14,997
So don't learn your lesson
from Dad's Smith & Wesson

700
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:18,939
And don't be a suitor
of Papa's six-shooter

701
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:22,535
Just get that preacher
on the run

702
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:26,446
Or you'll be just another
notch on Father's gun

703
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:34,556
You'll be just another notch
on Father's shotgun

704
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:37,821
If'n you don't marry me

705
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:42,558
So if you'd rather be found
'neath six feet of ground

706
00:56:42,632 --> 00:56:45,999
<i>Just leave me ditched
instead of gettin'hitched</i>

707
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:49,436
Now, Pa says
if you wanna linger

708
00:56:49,506 --> 00:56:53,909
When he takes that gun
from the wall

709
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:57,242
You'd better put that ring
on my finger

710
00:56:57,313 --> 00:57:00,749
Or you won't breathe
no more at all

711
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:02,785
At all

712
00:57:02,852 --> 00:57:07,789
<i>So don't be a jester
with Papa's Winchester</i>

713
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:12,294
<i>And don't be an eyeful
in Daddy's ol'rifle</i>

714
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:15,525
And stop hesitatin'
and don't keep me waitin'

715
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:19,227
Just get that preacher
on the run

716
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:23,671
Or you'll be
just another notch

717
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:31,476
You'll be just another notch
on Father's gun

718
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:44,216
Oh, you fascinating creature. I
can't let you go, you know that.

719
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:47,661
Let me run my fingers through
your hair. That's my hat.

720
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:52,133
Dorothy, have another drink.
A small one. Go ahead.

721
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:56,633
Mm!

722
00:57:56,706 --> 00:57:58,537
Squeeze Box!

723
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:02,567
This is my kissin' cousin.

724
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:05,546
That weren't no cousinly kiss. Shh!

725
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:09,073
Sure weren't. Never mind,
Calem. The boy ain't hitched yet.

726
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:13,145
No, but it 'tain't fittin'.
I'll get the bride to be.

727
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:18,217
Calem sure is anxious
to get you married.

728
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:20,558
But so am I.

729
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:23,929
Say you will.
Pretty please?

730
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,197
Mm-hmm. Dorothy,
let's drink to our wedding.

731
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:41,608
Squeeze Box...

732
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:47,247
Howdy, Cousin. I'm sorry,
Matt, but I want him for myself.

733
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:53,091
I'm sorry, Dorothy. I want Matt
for myself. You fascinating beauty.

734
00:58:53,162 --> 00:58:57,121
Why, Wilbert! Let me run my
fingers through your hair.

735
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,033
But Wilbert, how could you
have forgotten so soon?

736
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:02,628
Why, just a moment ago
I kissed you.

737
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:06,732
Anybody that would kiss me would
kiss anybody. Puh-lease, Dorothy.

738
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:08,970
Puh-lease.
Excuse me.

739
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:12,674
Come, my little loved one.
Come on.

740
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:19,281
If I hadn't seen that,
I wouldn't have believed it.

741
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:21,915
He drunk from the jug
and saw Matt first.

742
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:26,758
How long does it take to wear off?
Depends on how big a swig he took.

743
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:35,166
Oh, Squeeze Box, I can see
the lovelight in your eyes.

744
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:39,072
Matt, don't put it out.

745
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:42,839
Gimme that jug. I'll mark it
so nobody else will get it.

746
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:45,346
You got a pencil?

747
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:52,486
Wilbert, I wanna
talk to you.

748
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:55,547
<i>I can't hear you,</i>

749
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:58,423
for the wedding bells
are ringin' in my ear.

750
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:02,487
Let's drink to them
weddin' bells.

751
01:00:02,565 --> 01:00:05,329
Eh...
Uh, no, no, uh...

752
01:00:05,401 --> 01:00:09,337
The bride first. Come
on, Matt. Not that one.

753
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:12,169
Just a teensy-weensy bit.
But not this.

754
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:16,405
<i>Why not? That's
some of Granny's best corn.</i>

755
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:24,150
You shouldn't have drunk that. Why not?

756
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:31,124
Howdy, Cousin. What're
you lookin' at me for?

757
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:36,427
Why should I ever want to look at
anything else, you fascinatin' creature.

758
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:40,629
Eh, b-b-but look... Yes. Not
now. Al, kiss me. Just once.

759
01:00:40,703 --> 01:00:45,800
Let me run my fingers through your
hair. Just a minute. She's mine.

760
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:48,776
She's not yours. I'm
your girl. No, you're not!

761
01:00:48,845 --> 01:00:52,508
I've changed my mind.
Well, I've changed my mind.

762
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:55,710
I haven't changed mine.
And I haven't changed mine.

763
01:00:55,785 --> 01:00:59,152
And I'm going out of my mind! She's mine!

764
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:03,181
<i>I'm your girl.
No, you're not.!</i>

765
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:05,921
You're mine! I am not. You're mine!

766
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:07,929
Get away!
Somebody's mine!

767
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:12,263
Some kind of party game? Think so, Calem?

768
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,269
Can't rightly say.

769
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:18,637
I think still think Cousin
Squeeze Box is a little "tetched".

770
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:23,304
"Tetched" or no "tetched",
there are gonna be a weddin'.

771
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:33,179
All right, judge,
start the marryin'.

772
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:36,419
Squeeze Box,
you'll never regret this.

773
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:40,895
We get the treasure, and you get
yourself a fine little mountain flower.

774
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:44,490
If there be anybody in this
assembly who has reason why...

775
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:47,092
this here ceremony
shouldn't take place...

776
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:49,035
Listen to me.

777
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:53,371
'Cause if'n you don't, this here
shootin' iron'll speak for me.

778
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:55,968
Dorothy, this is
ridiculous. You can't do it.

779
01:01:56,045 --> 01:02:01,449
I can't? I'll bullet any man,
woman or mule that tries to stop me.

780
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:06,454
I came here to get me a man.
Live if possible.

781
01:02:06,522 --> 01:02:09,457
Dead if necessary.

782
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:14,291
And that man
is Wilbert "Squeeze Box" McCoy.

783
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:17,127
I wanna, I wanna, I
wanna... You wanna what?

784
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:22,001
I wanna go home.
And I want Al.

785
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:26,303
Then get yourself
a gun and get 'im.

786
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:30,277
<i>Go on, judge.
Make him my ever-lovin'man.</i>

787
01:02:30,346 --> 01:02:32,940
<i>If there's anybody else...</i>

788
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:45,555
Clark, what happened?
Where am I?

789
01:02:45,628 --> 01:02:48,722
You're all right now,
but you almost married Wilbert.

790
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:52,359
Oh, no! Well, I never. Hmm!

791
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:55,598
I wanna marry Matt,
anyway. Hmm-mm!

792
01:02:55,671 --> 01:03:00,370
That's my girl. Oh-ho-ho-ho!
Go ahead, judge, we're ready.

793
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:09,850
What's goin' on here?

794
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:13,878
If I get a chance to get all the
words out, you're going to be married.

795
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:17,722
Good. To Dorothy?
Uh, to Matt.

796
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,422
Mm-hmm!
I don't wanna marry her.

797
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:23,863
And I don't wanna marry him.
I don't wanna marry anybody!

798
01:03:23,933 --> 01:03:27,630
By sassafras! I come 30 miles
to do this here knot tyin'!

799
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:32,663
I'll marry him anytime. You
mean, you want to marry Al?

800
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:37,111
He's so gorgeous. But he ain't no McCoy!

801
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:41,344
Calem, we'll make him a McCoy.
We'll do it the hard way.

802
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:44,614
We will christen him.
Have you got a jug? Yeah.

803
01:03:44,687 --> 01:03:47,520
Let me have it.

804
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:49,524
Ha-ha!

805
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,360
Wilbert! Wilbert!
Wilbert!

806
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:55,920
You can't
do this to me!

807
01:03:55,998 --> 01:04:01,129
Uh-huh. Calem, this may be your
last chance to get rid of Matt.

808
01:04:01,204 --> 01:04:04,435
And besides, I'll throw in five
percent of the treasure for a dowry.

809
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:07,442
But, Wilbert,
I'm your pal.

810
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:12,243
Oh, Al, you're gonna marry
a sweet little mountain flower.

811
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:16,718
Oh, goody! All right,
brother-in-law, let's make it legal.

812
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:19,414
Now, judge,
go ahead.

813
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:32,364
Who's gettin' married?

814
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:34,960
You and him.

815
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:39,531
But I don't want him.
I want him.

816
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:42,134
Somebody find out
who wants who!

817
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:46,807
Calm yourself, judge. We'll be
glad to give you the right answers.

818
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,283
Won't we, sugar? We sure will, honey.

819
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:51,582
No Winfields!

820
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:57,115
That's right. If'n a feud starts, it'd be
mighty unhandy havin' a Winfield in the family.

821
01:04:57,193 --> 01:04:59,593
Oh, it's time you stopped
this stupid feuding.

822
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:05,328
There's not a better man among you than Clark
Winfield. If he wants me, I'm proud to have him.

823
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:08,495
Go ahead, judge.

824
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:13,941
If there's anybody else, let him
speak now or forever hold their peace.

825
01:05:16,145 --> 01:05:18,613
Winfields!

826
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:23,482
Hey, come on over! Clark and
Dorothy are gettin' hitched.

827
01:05:27,056 --> 01:05:31,959
That's what I figured'd be goin' on. There ain't
no Winfield gonna tie up with no McCoy wench.

828
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:34,326
Dan, this is
my business.

829
01:05:35,898 --> 01:05:40,164
You Winfields has got the best
of the bargain, so 'bide by it.

830
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:46,106
I'm seein' Dorothy's point. Feudin's
silly. From now on, I'm a peaceful woman.

831
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:49,508
Granny's right. From now on,
let's have a peaceful feud.

832
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:52,877
You hush up,
Wi-i-i-ilbert!

833
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:56,180
There'd have been no trouble in
these hills if'n you and that gal...

834
01:05:56,252 --> 01:06:00,211
<i>hadn't come to see
the old woman.</i>

835
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:02,883
You said it again!

836
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:06,952
Winfield! Clark, get ahold of Dorothy!

837
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:19,798
Judge, you start the marryin'.
I'll start the car.

838
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:24,835
Go ahead, McCoys. You'ns a-started
this ruckus, so start a-shootin'.

839
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:29,647
Here. Us McCoys is in for
a fight. Good luck to ya.

840
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:31,710
Calem,
hold your fire!

841
01:06:31,787 --> 01:06:35,188
Now they can't make up their
mind who's gonna do the shootin'.

842
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:52,766
Keep on talkin', judge. That's only
the backfire of the car echoin'.

843
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:56,073
<i>I'm here to...</i>

844
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:05,687
Wait!

845
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:09,722
Hey, I ain't
finished yet!

846
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:12,087
Hold it!

847
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:15,722
Now that we're gonna
be kinfolks by marriage,

848
01:07:15,798 --> 01:07:20,633
what do you say we talk this whole
feud over peaceful and quiet like?

849
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:26,063
Well, let me hear
from ya!

850
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:47,989
What's going on out there? My
in-laws. They're acting like outlaws.

851
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:04,639
- I'm a-comin' for you,
Wi-i-i-ilbert! - How we gonna get away?

852
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:07,614
He can't come through the door.
I got it bolted.

853
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:11,619
And if he comes
through the window,

854
01:08:11,687 --> 01:08:14,918
I'll clunk him on the head
with this thing.

855
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:21,457
Al, I think
I scared him away.

856
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:26,159
Oughta sayin' your prayers,
Wi-i-i-ilbert!

857
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:38,569
You ain't a-gonna get away from
me this time, Wi-i-i-ilbert!

858
01:08:38,647 --> 01:08:43,812
He ain't Wi-i-i-ilbert! You better
both start sayin' your prayers!

859
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:48,653
<i>You'll get the chair for this, Devil
Dan.! Get the chair. The chair.!</i>

860
01:08:48,724 --> 01:08:53,491
<i>I ain't a-gonna get no chair.
The countyjudge is a Winfield.!</i>

861
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:57,054
Winfield or no Winfield,
you're gonna get the chair.

862
01:08:59,535 --> 01:09:02,231
Whee!
He got it.

863
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:04,932
Thanks, Matt.
You saved our lives.

864
01:09:05,007 --> 01:09:09,205
That ain't all I saved.
Come on.

865
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:16,542
I saved the treasure too. What's
the concertina got to do with it?

866
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:20,919
I ain't tellin', 'less'n
you promises to marry me.

867
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,618
He promises.
I do not!

868
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:26,684
I'm your agent
and I'll do your booking.

869
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:39,330
Will you please tell us where the
treasure is before we get shot?

870
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:43,572
All right. I'll tell you the
secret, but he's gotta marry me.

871
01:09:43,646 --> 01:09:46,672
Uh, he'll marry you
all right.

872
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:49,115
Now you broke
my concertina.

873
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:52,450
And it's a wastepaper basket. I
never knew it. Hey, it's a map.

874
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:56,548
<i>That's right.
The map of Lost Springs Mine.</i>

875
01:09:56,625 --> 01:10:01,585
That "X" shows where the
treasure is buried. It's a cinch.

876
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:06,124
Only trouble is, Lost Springs
Mine is in Winfield territory.

877
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:10,832
It "shore" is. Only I didn't know
there's treasure buried in it.

878
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:13,636
You know, you're gettin' to talk more like
Devil Dan. Let me hear you say "Wilbert. "

879
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:17,873
Wi-i-i-ilbert.
Oh, no. That...

880
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:23,385
Nicest little feller I ever
"knowed". I love him like a brother.

881
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:27,183
<i>Never see'd a feller
I liked so much.</i>

882
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:30,885
If you're such a pal, how
about calling off the fireworks?

883
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,394
Why "shore. "
Huh?

884
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:39,594
Winfields!
Hold your "fahr. "

885
01:10:39,668 --> 01:10:42,228
<i>It's me,
Devil Dan a-talkin'.</i>

886
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:53,672
Get in, boys.

887
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:56,741
But Dan'I!
What are you doin' there?

888
01:10:56,819 --> 01:11:00,516
I'm a-takin' my friends
to the Lost Springs Mine.

889
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:04,685
Well, that's our territory. I
don't think I "heared" you right.

890
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:09,629
You "heared" him right. Start
drivin', Daniel. Yes, sir.

891
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:22,209
Granny, Calem,
Squeeze Box run out on me.

892
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:25,213
And he tricked us outta the treasure. How?

893
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:29,149
I give 'im the concertina
'cause I thought he'd marry me.

894
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:34,520
- How'd you know the secret?
- I peeked while you was workin' it. I wouldn't have told if...

895
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:37,115
Double-cross his own kin,
will he?

896
01:11:37,192 --> 01:11:40,355
Calem, from now on
you're head of this clan.

897
01:11:40,429 --> 01:11:43,694
You get that concertina back,
and I don't care how.

898
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:45,961
That's what I've been
a-waitin' to hear.

899
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:50,062
<i>From now on, that Squeeze Box
ain't no better than a Winfield.</i>

900
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:52,869
Durn it,
I forgot my corn mash.

901
01:11:52,941 --> 01:11:54,875
Come on, McCoys!

902
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:13,524
It done it again!

903
01:12:21,403 --> 01:12:25,032
Well, there ya are. Anything
else I can do for ya, Squeeze Box?

904
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:28,736
Tell him to go home. Uh, no,
that's all right now, brother.

905
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:31,974
You and the boys
can go home.

906
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:35,278
Well, if that's the way you
want it, good-bye, brother.

907
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:37,182
<i>Good-bye.</i>

908
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:45,288
What am I doin' here...
with you?

909
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:48,330
You were just sayin'
good-bye, brother.

910
01:12:48,397 --> 01:12:52,458
Don't call me "brother",
Wi-i-i-ilbert!

911
01:12:56,338 --> 01:12:58,806
<i>Winfields.!</i>

912
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:02,742
<i>Wilbert!</i>

913
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,446
Wilbert!
Where are you, Wilbert?

914
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:09,609
<i>I'm down here.</i>

915
01:13:09,685 --> 01:13:12,950
<i>Watch out for that first step.
It's a big one.</i>

916
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:15,922
Come out there.
Come on up here.

917
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:21,293
What's the matter with you?
Give me your hand. Get my hand.

918
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:23,797
Come on, get up.
Nyahh!

919
01:13:23,866 --> 01:13:28,735
You coward, you! What are you trying to do?
Hide and make me fight the Winfields all alone?

920
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:32,568
<i>The Winfields!</i>

921
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:42,114
Oh!

922
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:49,617
There they are,
at the bottom of the shaft!

923
01:13:55,998 --> 01:13:58,899
They give us
the slip!

924
01:13:58,967 --> 01:14:04,428
Why don't we go get 'em? We can't
go up 'til somebody comes down.

925
01:14:04,506 --> 01:14:08,169
With the Winfields down there, we'll never
get the treasure. I'm gonna get the McCoys!

926
01:14:11,814 --> 01:14:14,044
There's the traitor!

927
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:15,913
Whoa!

928
01:14:15,984 --> 01:14:18,214
Help!

929
01:14:20,589 --> 01:14:23,820
<i>It won't go down.</i>

930
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:27,555
Hey, we're in the middle again.
Let's hide.

931
01:14:32,701 --> 01:14:36,637
They took the elevator.
We got 'em trapped. Get in.

932
01:14:36,705 --> 01:14:39,139
Don't nobody shoot Squeeze Box
'cept me!

933
01:14:52,454 --> 01:14:55,321
Just like those Winfields:
always raisin' the roof.

934
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:59,326
I gotta show Calem the map.
That'll prove that I'm no traitor.

935
01:14:59,394 --> 01:15:02,420
Come on. Okay, come on.
Let's go.

936
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:07,234
Aahhh! We've gotta put some weight on here.

937
01:15:07,302 --> 01:15:09,429
Huh? Help me carry these rocks.

938
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,996
They're up thar.
What are they doin'?

939
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:15,168
I know how we can catch 'em, Calem. How?

940
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:19,305
We stay right here, and then when
that other elevator comes down,

941
01:15:19,381 --> 01:15:22,748
we reach over and grab 'em. Uh-huh.

942
01:15:22,818 --> 01:15:26,310
Boy!

943
01:15:32,628 --> 01:15:34,653
Excuse me, hold this rock. Yeah.

944
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:38,257
Hey, is that what you've been
carrying? Yeah, they're heavy.

945
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:40,267
What's the matter with you? Oooh!

946
01:15:40,335 --> 01:15:43,600
Ah, there's no use. This won't go
down 'til they get off. Oh, yeah?

947
01:15:43,672 --> 01:15:45,606
Yeah.
I'll fix that.

948
01:15:45,674 --> 01:15:48,472
Hey, you McCoys. Get off the
elevator so we can come down.

949
01:15:56,451 --> 01:15:58,646
Hey! It's the treasure! Gold! Gold!

950
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:02,884
Don't forget, I'm your
agent. I get ten percent.

951
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:08,794
<i>My grandpappy! He must've
put in a burglar alarm.</i>

952
01:16:18,674 --> 01:16:21,507
What are you men
doing in here?

953
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:24,842
<i>What are you men doing
here? What are we doing here?</i>

954
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:28,542
This happens to be Fort Knox!
Fort Knox!

955
