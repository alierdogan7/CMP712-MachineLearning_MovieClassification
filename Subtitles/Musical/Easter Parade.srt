00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:16,514
-It does?
-Come on.

348
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:28,776
Oh, look. The Easter Parade.
Isn't it beautiful?

349
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,695
It's all right, if you like Easter Parades.

350
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,577
I can't believe I'm really here.

351
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,789
I used to read about the Easter Parade
in New York--

352
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,874
DON: Excuse me.
-In New York.

353
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:48,462
And then I'd look at the pictures
of the women in their lovely clothes...

354
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:52,841
...dream that maybe someday I--
Here I am.

355
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,635
Oh, look.

356
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,517
May I take your picture, Miss Hale?

357
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,353
PHOTOGRAPHER 1:
Hold it, Miss Hale.

358

PHOTOGRAPHER 2:
Just one more, Miss Hale.

359
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,899
-Good. Thank you.
PHOTOGRAPHER 3: Miss Hale.

360
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,569
Thank you.

361
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,040
Isn't she wonderful-looking!

362
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,875
Even with that silly hat.

363
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:29,962
-What's the matter with it?
-She must be very important.

364
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,214
Look at her clothes, the way she walks.

365
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:33,882
See her nose?

366
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,510
One year from now,
you're gonna put it out of joint.

367
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,054
-I am?
-Next Easter, when we walk down here...

368
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:42,182
...you'll cause more excitement
than an earthquake.

369
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,936
Every photographer will break his neck
to take your picture.

370
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:49,773
One year from today, no one is gonna
notice her when they look at you.

371
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,073
-This is lovely.
-That one.

372
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:00,200
Yes, Mr. Hewes.

373
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,625
May I see that, please?

374
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:12,338
-Isn't this beautiful?
-Wrap this up. Just send all the things.

375
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,590
WOMAN:
Yes, Mr. Hewes.

376
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,468
-You ready?
-Yes, Mr. Hewes.

377
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:29,146
Mr. Hewes, uh, I....

378
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,358
-These dresses are beautiful, but....
-But what?

379
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:35,986
Do they look like me,
like Hannah Brown?

380
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:40,115
There is no more Hannah Brown.
From now on, you're Juanita.

381
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:43,160
If you wanted a Juanita,
why did you pick me?

382
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,121
Now, don't get mad. This is business.

383
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,956
A girl dancer has to be exotic.

384
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,625
She has to be...

385
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,126
...a peach.

386
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,420
I suppose I'm a lemon.

387
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,963
No. Here's what I mean.

388
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:58,842
Now, when you walk down the street
alone do men try to catch your eye?

389
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,469
Of course they do.

390
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:03,389
Do they turn around and look at you?

391
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,600
I-- I don't know.

392
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,936
I never turn around to look at them.

393
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,479
-Here, give me those.
-What?

394
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,314
You go ahead. I wanna try something.

395
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,234
Just walk on ahead. I wanna see.

396
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,054
Right! You've got it.

397
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,014

-I'm afraid--
-Don't worry.

403
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,542
-It was just the first performance.
-I was so nervous.

404
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:39,545
One thing you mustn't do:
Get a stranglehold on me.

405
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,296
It pulls me off balance.

406
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:43,507
-I know.
-Relax, you'll be all right.

407
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,927
I hope so. Did you send these?

00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,096
-Yes.
-They're very beautiful.

-I got in this morning.

I thought you were almost finished
with law school.

00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:04,880
I am, I am. But I've decided
to become a doctor.

Well, it's liable to be a tough struggle.

-I start rehearsal soon for my new show.

Are you still going through
with that crazy idea?

469
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:50,402
Crazy? Because I don't wanna spend the
rest of my life being a common hoofer?

470
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,655
It was good enough
when I took you out of that chorus.

00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,159
You think if it hadn't been
for you, I'd still be there?

00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:01,079
That's possible. The fellow who ran
that place wasn't Ziegfeld.
