00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,637
Careful, toddy.

187
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,890
You're not really
funny, you know,

188
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:31,226
so why don't you just piss off?

189
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,479
You! You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

190
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,314
Bringing your sweet, old mother

191
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,065
into a place like this.

192
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:39,318
Gyaaah!

193
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,007
[Toddy] And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

194
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,994
you have a delightful
surprise coming to you...

195
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,241
no!

196
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:47,659
No!

197
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:48,869
Please.

198
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,888
Monsieur.

199
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,892
[Thunder]

200
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:17,648
Thank you.

201
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,865
[People shouting]

202
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,909
[Police whistle blows]

203
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,834
But nobody was seriously hurt.

204
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,002
That's why I'm only
closing you for a week.

205
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,005
You know how much
I will lose in one week?

206
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:45,133
A quarter of what
You'll lose in a month

207
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,511
if there is any more trouble.

208
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,935
[Siren]

209
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,524
You're fired!

210
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,777
I can't afford it.

211
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,195
You can't afford it?

212
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,989
What about me?
What about All this?

213
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:08,198
More ice.

214
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,075
You take it out of my salary.

215
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:12,494
Toddy, get out!

216
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,329
All right.

217
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,415
And don't come back!

218
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,001
If you ever set foot
in this place again,

219
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,836
I will have you thrown out!

220
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,671
Don't make it sound
like such a threat.

221
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,256
Being thrown out of this place

222
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,383
is significantly better
than being thrown out

223
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:27,593
of a leper colony.

224
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,052
Out!

225
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,896
Thank you.

226
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,024
Something to drink?

227
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,067
Ah, could I see your wine list?

228
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,028
We have a white 1934,

229
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,571
we have a red 1934.

230
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,865
Last week we had some rose,

231
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,034
but we're using it in the salad.

232
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:53,744
Which do you recommend?

233
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,621
The red is 6 centimes cheaper.

234
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,164
I'll have the white.

235
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,084
I bet you are a Rockefeller.

236
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,424
[Thunder]

237
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,083
Is something wrong?

238
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,251
I thought maybe you had a dog.

239
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:44,503
Dog?

240
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,421
I've only been gone 5 minutes.

241
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,799
I figured something
helped you eat it.

242
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,467
It was delicious.

243
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:51,927
Do you want a salad?

244
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:52,844
Later.

245
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,471
Later.

246
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:55,931
The chicken was so good,
I thought I might try the pork.

247
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,516
Does it take long?

248
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,976
About, uh, half an hour.

249
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,936
What about
the Boeuf Bourguignonne?

250
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,521
That's ready.

251
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,148
I'll have that, and I'll
have the salad afterwards.

252
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,858
You realize, of course,

253
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,527
you're entitled to two salads.

254
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,862
Could you put them
both on one plate?

255
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,197
That's possible.

256
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:13,657
Terrific.

257
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,161
Delicious wine.

258
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:22,499
Maybe you'd like to
choose your 2 desserts.

259
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,459
Apple flan and coupe Jacques

260
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,253
might go well together.

261
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:32,259
Just a small coffee.

262
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,221
Good evening.

263
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,723
I had the pleasure

264
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,641
of hearing you sing
this afternoon.

265
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,184
Oh, you must be mistaken.

266
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,353
I... i haven't sung
in about two weeks.

267
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:44,980
Your audition at Chez lui.

268
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,690
Oh. That was not singing,

269
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,234
and I would hardly
call it an audition.

270
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,236
Ha ha ha. I used
to work there.

271
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:52,863
My condolences.

272
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,573
Well, I hope I
haven't bothered you.

273
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,366
I just wanted to tell you

274
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,493
that I think you
have a lovely voice,

275
00:17:58,703 --> 00:17:59,745
and to say how sorry I am

276
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,371
that I can't buy you dinner.

277
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,581
Thank you.
Oops.

278
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:03,749
Pardon me, monsieur.

279
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,083
Oh, thank you.

280
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:06,773
Could I have a knife
and fork, please?

281
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,587
Excuse me.

282
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,048
Why are you sorry that
you can't buy me dinner?

283
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,924
Casse.

284
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,426
Broke?

285
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,094
I'm also Carroll Todd...

286
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:19,097
toddy to nearly
everybody who knows me.

287
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,891
Victoria...

288
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,601
Grant.

289
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,770
I hope we meet again
when I'm flush.

290
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,438
Won't you sit down?

291
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,356
Please?

292
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,652
Have dinner with me.

293
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,406
Thank you.

294
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,789
You know, it's very strange.

295
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,415
At the club, I thought you were

296
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,626
just about at the end
of your rope.

297
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,544
I was. I am.

298
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,964
This is the first
decent meal I've had

299
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:54,591
in almost four days.

300
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:55,801
And you can't pay for it.

301
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,761
Casse.

302
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,304
Ha! Ha! Ha!

303
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:02,224
And you want me to
have dinner with you.

304
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:03,642
I want you

305
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,936
to have the best damn
dinner you ever had.

306
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,270
Have two.

307
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,647
I started off with
the roast chicken,

308
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:09,981
and I segued to
the Boeuf Bourguignonne.

309
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:11,316
It's anybody's guess

310
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:12,526
what I could end up with.

311
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,653
Oh, I'd guess about 30 days.

312
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,988
If All goes well,

313
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,616
I expect to leave
here poor but sated.

314
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,536
I have a...

315
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,162
Bug in my purse.

316
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:25,747
At the appropriate moment,

317
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:27,457
it goes in my salad.

318
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,959
It'll never work.

319
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,418
A bug in my salad?

320
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,504
In a place like this,
it would be an event

321
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,590
if there wasn't
a bug in your salad.

322
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,676
What about a...
Cockroach?

323
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:38,885
A cockroach?

324
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,512
Shh!

325
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:41,972
Bigger than your thumb.

326
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,515
Oh, god!

327
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:44,724
Waiter.

328
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:45,976
Try the chicken.

329
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,186
I really recommend it.

330
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:51,606
Um, the Bourguignonne
was just a little tough.

331
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,608
Maybe the way you're eating,

332
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:54,938
your jaws are getting tired.

333
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,361
Speaking of overworked jaws,

334
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,989
why don't you treat yours
to a sabbatical

335
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,366
and fetch me a wine list?

336
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,951
This is All they have.

337
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:05,370
This? Last time I saw
a specimen like this,

338
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,455
they had to shoot the horse.

339
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,624
How lucky can you get?

340
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,002
In one evening, a Rockefeller

341
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,712
and a Groucho Marx.

342
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,047
They didn't shoot a real horse.

343
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:18,383
Just a costume
with two waiters in it.

344
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:21,052
I shall think of a sharp retort

345
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:23,054
while I'm getting
your roast chicken.

346
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,891
It's a wise man who knows
when to throw in the towel.

347
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,476
And it is a moron
who gives advice

348
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,145
to a horse's ass.

349
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:35,775
Ha ha ha ha!

350
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:43,950
I made the dressing myself

351
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,411
with the last of the rose.

352
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:48,038
I'll bet it's delicious.

353
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,414
I wouldn't bet on it.

354
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:51,082
Go on, try it.

355
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,852
I think I'll wait till
the Bourguignonne

356
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,044
settle a bit.

357
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,921
You don't have to eat it.

358
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,130
Oh, I want to.

359
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,382
You will be the first to know.

360
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:04,679
You'd better go now.

361
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:05,931
I want to lend my support.

362
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,599
Oh, that's lovely.

363
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,935
But it's my cockroach
in my purse,

364
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:12,020
and I have to get it
into my salad.

365
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,689
I'm perfectly willing
to take over your salad.

366
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:17,275
You can just slip me
the purse under the table.

367
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:18,276
Listen, you hate cockroaches

368
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:19,486
as much as I do,

369
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:21,029
what if I manage and you faint?

370
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:23,240
Then it's possible
I shall wake up in prison.

371
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,617
Then I can't talk you out of it?

372
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,410
You don't have time.

373
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,122
Careful it doesn't crawl out.

374
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:32,999
Anybody looking?

375
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:35,585
Nope.

376
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,135
I don't see it.

377
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:45,136
How's the salad?

378
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:46,137
Aah!

379
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:47,472
Have you tried it yet?

380
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:48,932
No.

381
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,934
No. I was, um,
just about to.

382
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,812
We would like another
bottle of wine.

383
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,397
We'd like to try the red.

384
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:56,940
Aah!

385
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,858
[Crash]

386
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,320
Co-co-cockroach.

387
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,571
A cockroach?

388
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,115
In my sa-sa-salad.

389
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,658
I can't believe it.

390
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,118
I don't believe it.

391
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,887
Are you impugning
this lady's integrity?

392
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:11,121
She's impugning my salad.

393
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,330
Oh, no, no, no.

394
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,820
I-I-I'm sure
it wasn't your fault

395
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,917
your salad had
a cockroach in it.

396
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:17,335
It didn't, and it wasn't.

397
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:19,004
I demand to see the manager.

398
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:20,505
Yes, sir.

399
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:21,339
This lady found
a cockroach in her salad.

400
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,008
So I gather.

401
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:24,801
Well, what are you
going to do about it?

402
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,761
I'm going to apologize.

403
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,680
Madame, I regret that you found

404
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,515
a cockroach in your salad.

405
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:32,976
I can assure you
that in the five years

406
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,519
I've been running
this restaurant,

407
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:36,521
there have only been
two other occasions

408
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:37,939
when customers complained

409
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:40,525
of having found insects
in their food.

410
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:42,027
You see?
It's happened before.

411
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,445
On both occasions,

412
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:45,155
it turned out that the customers

413
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,325
had actually put the
insects in their food,

414
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,160
hoping to blackmail
the restaurant

415
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,163
and thus avoid having
to pay their checks.

416
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,622
Uh-huh.

417
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,708
Surely you're not suggesting...

418
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:57,917
that madame is trying

419
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:58,710
to avoid paying her check?

420
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,045
Well, of course not,

421
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:02,297
and as a manager
of this restaurant,

422
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,132
I hope madame accepts my apology

423
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:05,383
for any inconvenience

424
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:07,385
she may have been caused.

425
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,387
Thank you.
Ma... madame does.

426
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:12,223
Now, that is what I
have done about it.

427
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:15,393
What are you going
to do about it?

428
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:16,603
I?

429
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:17,479
There is still the matter

430
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:18,688
of your check.

431
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:19,814
My check?

432
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:21,066
There was no cockroach

433
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,650
in your salad.

434
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,651
No, no.
I invited this man

435
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:24,569
to have dinner with me.

436
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:25,779
Oh, I see.

437
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,238
Am I to gather, madame,

438
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:30,033
that since this
gentleman is your guest,

439
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,993
you don't feel
that you should pay

440
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:33,578
for his dinner, either?

441
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:35,348
I would say that
under the circumstances

442
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,174
that's the only
logical conclusion available.

443
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:40,585
I will tell you what
I consider to be

444
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:43,213
the only logical
conclusion available.

445
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,091
Either you or madame
will pay the entire...

446
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,425
aah!

447
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,719
[Customers screaming]

448
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:07,946
This way!

449
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,406
What?!

450
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,282
What?!

451
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:14,077
[Victoria] I was
the leading soprano

452
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,037
of the bath touring
light opera company.

453
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:18,039
[Toddy] Very athletic
for a soprano.

454
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:20,041
That's because I
have three brothers.

455
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:21,292
Hmm, I know what you mean.

456
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:22,782

two older sisters.

Thank you.

460
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:28,758

461
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,638
Do you have any bicarbonate?

462
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:35,640
Top shelf.

463
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,059
I have the worst heartburn.

464

[Ah-choo]

465
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:42,063
Can I ask you a question?

466
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:45,066
You want to know
if I'm a homosexual?

467
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:46,484
No.

468
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,820
I want to know if
you're a hypochondriac.

469
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,071
Ha ha ha!

470
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:51,656
Not necessarily.

471
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,199
Oh.

472
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,706
Oh. Well,
my husband was.

473
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:03,084
The day we got married,
he got the shingles,

474
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:04,669
and when we got divorced,

00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:06,087
his ulcer perforated.

[Toddy blows his nose]

00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:10,300
How long have you been
a homosexual?

478
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,011
How long have you
been a soprano?

479
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,471
Since I was 12.

480
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,556
I was a late bloomer.

481
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,852
What happened

482
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,563
to the bath touring
light opera company?

483
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:27,442
I guess you could say

484
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,820
Lou cassava took French
leave with the bankroll.

485
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,197
Lou cassava?

486
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:35,200

Sam put him up to it.

Oh, god.

You know,

492
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:47,045
you should stay in bed
and force liquids.

493
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,047
That's good advice for a camel.

494

to take care of you?

00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,218
Oh, it's only a cold.

A cold tonight

497
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,888
could be pneumonia
by the morning.

498
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,890
Are you sure your husband
was a hypochondriac

499
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,683
before he married you?

500
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,373
I know you think
that I'm an alarmist.

501
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:04,229
Only because you sound like one.

502
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:05,897
I've had enough
personal experience

503
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:09,067
to know that when it
comes to your health,

504
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,486
it does not pay to take chances.

505
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,196
Then you can stop worrying.

506
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,491
With the exception of
saxophone lessons and the Metro,

507
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,618
I never pay to take anything.

508
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,248
You know what I'm going to do?

509
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:24,874
What?

510
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,604
I'm going to see if
my clothes are dry,

511
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:30,088
and then I'm going to try
to sneak back into my hotel.

512
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:32,507
What if I wake up
with pneumonia?

513
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,676
Well, I'll just have to come
round early in the morning

514

and check on you.

515
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:39,430

Why couldn't I?

00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,985
I've saved up a few francs for.

555
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:16,986
Here.

556
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,988
You know what they say.

557
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:20,365
What?

558
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:23,034
"Neither a borrower
nor a lender be."

559
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:26,537
"For a loan oft loses
both itself and friend."

560
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:27,830
Exactly.

561
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,457
You were willing to compromise

562
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,626
your virtue for a meatball.

563
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,629
Well, I was out of my mind
at the time,

564
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,839
and at least it was
something for something.

565
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,383
All right.

566
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,635
We'll make this strictly
a business proposition.

567
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,637
I'll charge you
a weekly interest

568
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:45,181
equivalent to the going
rate of one meatball.

569
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:46,391
[Cough]

570
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,684
Oh, damn.

571
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:49,394
Toddy...

572
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:51,145
You're sweet and generous.

573
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:52,730
Exhausted.

574
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,732
How would I ever pay you back?

575
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:56,401
Well, we'll solve that tomorrow.

576
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,861
In the meantime,
I'm giving the orders.

577
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,989
You are going to get into
those pajamas and come to bed.

578
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,574
There?

579
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,243
You're welcome to the sofa,

580
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:07,662
but you have my word of honor

581
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,831
this is much more comfortable

582
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,290
and infinitely safer.

583
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,921
[Ah-choo]

584
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:18,840
Oh, god.

585
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:21,426
There's nothing
more inconvenient

586
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:24,846
than an old queen
with a head cold.

587
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,265
[Honk]

588
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,016
[Honk honk]

589
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:36,023
I won't be long.

590
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,907
I resent being treated
like a helpless invalid!

591
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:47,535
[Victoria] Oh, will you
keep your mouth shut?

592
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:50,121
Now, I'll cash the check,
pay my hotel bill,

593
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,749
and be back in time
to fix lunch.

594
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,543
I can bloody well
fix my own lunch.

595
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:57,545
Not with a fever, you can't.

596
00:29:57,755 --> 00:30:00,548
What makes you so sure
I've got a fever?

597
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:02,550
Because you're burning up,
that's why.

598
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,926
I'm naturally
warm-blooded.

599
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:06,137
To be that naturally
warm-blooded,

600
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,556
you'd have to be
a Saint Bernard.

601
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:11,559
You look better in Richard's
clothes than he does.

602
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:13,311
Of course, he looks
better out of them.

603
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,771
Well?

604
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,230
You're right,
you don't have a fever.

605
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,774
In fact, you don't even
have a temperature!

606
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,567
Now, leave it there.

607
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:21,152
Does Richard have a hat?

608
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,862
In the closet.

609
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:27,533
[Door slams]

610
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:28,951
[Richard]
Toddy?

611
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,703
Richard!

612
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,335
Good morning, Richard.
You look like a raccoon.

613
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,128
I came by to pick up my things.

614
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:40,922
I thought it was
to pay me the money

615
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:42,507
you owed me.

616
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:46,469
I don't owe you a thing,
you pathetic old queer.

617
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:51,307
Unh! Ah!

618
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:52,308
You bastard!

619
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,519
Get up!

620
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:57,772
You get back in bed!

621
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,649
Now...

622
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:00,983
Next time,

623
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:04,612
pick on someone your own size.

624
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:05,822
Ooh!

625
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:07,782
And don't come back!

626
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,242
[Toddy]
Good.

627
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,920
[Groan]

628
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:25,174
[Groan]

629
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:26,551
God, my nose.

630
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,010
What happened?

631
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,805
There was a man
wearing my clothes.

632
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,890
I think he broke my nose!

633
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,017
Toddy, you're delirious.

634
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,018
Lower your voice.

635
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,019
Toddy...
lower.

636
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:38,020
[Low]
Toddy.

637
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,397
Caruso, not Chaliapin.

638
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,046
If you don't get back
into that bed...

639
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:41,816
good! When you're angry,
it drops naturally.

640
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:42,817
Think angry.

641
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,026
Oh, my...

642
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:45,069
oh, god!
What an inspiration!

643
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,319
I'm going to get a doctor.

644
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:47,405
Victoria, it will work!

645
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,739
Oh, toddy, it will not.

646
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,408
If you listen to me
and do exactly as I say,

647
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,410
in six weeks You'll be
the toast of Paris,

648
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:53,870
and we will both be very rich.

649
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,079
Oh...
Very, very,

650
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:56,414
very rich.
But, oh, my god.

651
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:57,832
Think! No more bath
light opera company.

652
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,166
Well, of cour...

653
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:00,418
no more mikado and seedy tenors.

654
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:01,586
Yes, but...

655
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:02,587
caviar instead of meatballs!

656
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:03,838
Where are you going?

657
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,047
To get some scissors!

658
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:06,841
People believe what they see,

659
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,259
and this afternoon,

660
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:09,886
Andre Cassell is going to meet

661
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,596
Europe's greatest
female impersonator.

662
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:12,889
Andre Cassell

663
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,599
is the biggest agent in Paris.

664
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:15,850
If I'm the greatest,

665
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,268
why hasn't he heard of me?

666
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,037
You're the greatest,
but you're unknown,

667
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:19,854
except in Poland.

668
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,272
Poland?

669
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,607
You're count Grazinsky,
Polish aristocrat,

670
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,136
and you speak
very little English.

671
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,443
Your family disowned you

672
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:26,972
when they discovered
you were gay.

673
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,446
Oh, now, wait a minute.

674
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,895
We met in Warsaw, fell in love,

675
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,449
and I brought you to Paris.

676
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:32,450
Ah, hold it!

677
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:33,701
What's wrong?

678
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:34,951
What's wrong?
What's right?

679
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,454
A woman pretending to be a man

680
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,455
pretending to be a woman?

681
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:38,664
Ridiculous.

682
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,790
It's preposterous!

683
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,958
In fact, it's so preposterous,

684
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:42,460
no one would ever believe it.

685
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:43,878
And yet, you expect them
to believe count...

686
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:44,879
What's his name?

687
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:45,880
Grazinsky.

688
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,882
Grazinsky, a gay Polish

689
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,926
female impersonator?

690
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,886
Darling, All anyone
has to believe

691
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,471
is that you're a man.

692
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,932
To convince an audience
that an illusion is real,

693
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,476
the magician creates
a plausible diversion.

694
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,103
Count Grazinsky is
our plausible diversion.

695
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:02,813
Toddy, no audience
is that gullible.

696
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:04,649
They'll know he's a phony.

697
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:05,650
Right.

698
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:07,068
Well?

699
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:09,487
They'll know he's a phony.

700
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,573
Toddy, I don't know
how to act like a man.

701
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:13,658
Contrary to
the popular conception

702
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:14,867
of how a man acts,

703
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,160
there are All sorts of men

704
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,162
who act in All sorts of ways.

705
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:20,164
I mean, as opposed
to the way women act.

706
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:21,457
I am personally acquainted

707
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:22,667
with at least a dozen men

708
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:24,335
who act exactly like women

709
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,128
and vice versa.

710
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,538
There are just some things
that are naturally masculine!

711
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:29,757
Name one.

712
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:30,758
Um... Um...

713
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:32,426
Peeing standing up.

714
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:34,178
Ha ha. on the other hand,
there's absolutely no rule

715
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:36,180
that says a man can't sit down.

716
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,515
Men have Adam's apples.

717
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:38,849
So do some women.

718
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:39,767
Name one.

719
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:40,768
Nana Lanoux.

720
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:41,769
What?

721
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:42,979
Taxi!

722
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,188
Nana Lanoux?
Who's she?

723
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:45,523
The last woman I slept with.

724
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,441
When was that?

725
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:49,777
The night before the morning I
decided to become a homosexual.

726
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:51,195
Very dashing.

727
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:53,364
I can't wear this All the time.

728
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,991
Why not? It might
set a fashion.

729
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,535
Did miss Lanoux
have a big Adam's apple?

730
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,037
Like a coconut!

731
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:02,331
[Typing]

732
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,220
Good morning.

733
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,556
Would you please tell
Mr. Cassell

734
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,182
that Carroll Todd is here?

735
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:21,559
Why?

736
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:22,852
Why?

Excuse me.
Pardon us.

Pardon me. Pardon me.

Excuse me.
Pardon me.

938

Come on, dear.

939
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:13,997
I hope six, eight weeks,

940
00:47:14,207 --> 00:47:16,124
something like that.

941
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:19,002
Hi.

942
00:47:19,212 --> 00:47:20,504
Hello.

943
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:23,423
Oh, I'm Norma Cassady.

944
00:47:23,633 --> 00:47:26,009
You were just grand.

945
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:27,427
Thank you.

946
00:47:27,637 --> 00:47:30,013
Oh, and, uh,
this is king Marchand.

947
00:47:30,223 --> 00:47:31,681
How do you do?
How do you do?

948
00:47:31,891 --> 00:47:33,350
I've got to admit
for a while there,

949
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:34,851
I was really cheesed off.

950
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:37,145
King's tongue
was hanging out a foot.

951
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:39,105
Then, you know when you
took that wig off,

952
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:41,817
I just couldn't believe it!

953
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:44,027
King still doesn't.

954
00:47:44,237 --> 00:47:45,237
I'm flattered.

955
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:46,029
I'm delighted you could make it,

956
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:47,030
Mr. Marchand.

957
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,240
Oh, thank you.

958
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:50,659
May I introduce
Mr. Todd?

959
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,035
It's a pleasure.

960
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:54,037
How do you do?
This is miss Cassady.

961
00:47:54,247 --> 00:47:56,039
Mademoiselle.

963
00:47:57,667 --> 00:47:59,668
Oh! Me, too.

964
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:02,712
Well, what do you
think of our new star?

965
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:04,047
He thinks he's a phony.

966

Oh, I think she's very talented.

967
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:07,676
But he doesn't think
you're a man.

968
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,636
I'll tell her what I think.

969
00:48:09,846 --> 00:48:10,637
"Her." See?

970
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:11,638

971
00:48:11,848 --> 00:48:12,639
What?

972
00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:13,640

973
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:15,600
Oh. Sure.

974
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,645
Care to, um...

975
00:48:18,855 --> 00:48:20,856
Care to mingle
with me, Mr. Todd?

976

Miss Cassady,

977
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:23,515
excluding Victor's performance,

978
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:24,734
mingling with you

979
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,069
may well turn out to be

980
00:48:26,279 --> 00:48:28,071
the highlight of the evening.

981
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,073
I just love Frenchmen!

982
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:32,075
Oh, so do I.

983
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:33,702
I'll get you a drink.

984
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,203
Well, thank you.

985
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:45,964
You were saying,
Mr. Marchand?

986
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,173
Well, I...

987
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:49,259
I just find it hard to believe

988
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,094
that you're a man.

989
00:48:51,304 --> 00:48:55,098
Because you found me
attractive as a woman?

990
00:48:55,308 --> 00:48:57,434
Yes, as a matter of fact.

991
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,269
It happens frequently.

992
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,271
Not to me.

993
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,273
It just proves the old adage...

994
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,275
there's a first time
for everything.

995
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,110
I don't think so.

996
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,279
But you're not 100% sure.

997
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:10,780
Practically.

998
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:13,116
Ah, but to a man like you...

999
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:14,743
someone who believes

1000
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,120
he could never
under any circumstances

1001
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,122
find another man attractive,

1002
00:49:19,332 --> 00:49:21,541
the margin between
practically and for sure

1003
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:24,794
must be as wide
as the Grand Canyon.

1004
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:27,964
If you were a man,
I'd knock your block off.

1005
00:49:28,174 --> 00:49:30,091
And prove that you're a man.

1006
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:31,801
That's a woman's argument.

1007
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:33,762
Your problem,
Mr. Marchand,

1008
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,263
is that you're preoccupied

1009
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:36,556
with stereotypes.

1010
00:49:36,766 --> 00:49:38,558
I think it's as simple as...

1011
00:49:38,768 --> 00:49:40,560
you're one kind of man,

1012
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:42,228
I'm another.

1013
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:43,730
And what kind are you?

1014
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:46,149
One that doesn't
have to prove it

1015
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:47,817
to myself...

1016
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:49,235
Or anyone.

1017
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:51,279
Excuse me.

1018
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:56,701
Thank you.

1019
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:02,082
I...You're kidding!

1020
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:06,503
You... you really
are queer?

1021
00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:09,798
Oh! We prefer gay.

1022
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:13,635
Oh, but you're so...
Attractive.

[Chuckles]

1024
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:17,639
Well, I just think
it's a terrible waste.

1025
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,015
[Laughs]

1026
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:21,017
You know what I think?

1027
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:22,602
What?

1028
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:27,023
I think that the right woman
could reform you.

1029
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:29,609
You know, I think
the right woman

1030
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:30,860
could reform you, too.

1031
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:33,863
Oh! Me give up men?
Forget it!

1032
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:37,158
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

1033
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:38,201
Norma?

1034
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:39,869
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1035
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,872
I still think
it's a terrible waste.

1036
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:44,708
Well, if it's any consolation,

1037
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:47,043
I assure you it is not wasted.

1038
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:48,712
Oh!

1039
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:49,671

1040
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,423
What? Jeez...

1041
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:58,096
Au revoir.

1042
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:01,057

Come on. Get out
of my way. Go on.

See you in church.

Oh...

1046
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,325
Don't ever leave me alone
like that again.

1047
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:21,911
What did you think
of king Marchand?

1048
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:23,913
King Marchand is
an arrogant, opinionated,

1049
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:25,540
chauvinistic pain in the ass.

1050
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,000
I think I could fall
in love with him.

1051
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:29,002
I think I could, too.

1052
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:32,088
I'm tellin' ya, he's gay.

1053
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:33,715
I know All about it.

1054
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,091
We had a long talk.

1055
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:37,093
They met in Poland or something,

1056
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:39,012
and he brought him to Paris,

1057
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,556
and he's making him a big star.

1058
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:43,224
They're lovers.

1059
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,894
And I know why you
don't want to believe it.

1060
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,145
Ha!

1061
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,899
Can I give you a lift
to your hotel?

1062
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:52,525
That's kind of you, but...

1063
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:54,110
we'd be delighted.

1064
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,111
Hotel?

1065
00:51:55,321 --> 00:51:56,321
Why not?

1066
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,539
I heard you, Norma.
I heard you.

1067
00:52:06,749 --> 00:52:09,459
I just don't know what
you're so burned up about.

1068
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:10,960
Thank you.

1069
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,850
I mean, it was a perfectly
natural mistake.

1070
00:52:12,922 --> 00:52:14,089
Knock it off, Norma.

1071
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:16,549
Well, squash thought
he was a woman.

1072
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:20,053
If you think about it,
it's really very funny.

1073
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:21,971
He isn't bad-looking,

1074
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:24,557
but I knew he was
a man right away.

1075
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:26,976
It's the padding.

1076
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:29,979
I don't care how clever
those costumes are.

1077
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:33,566
I mean, there are just
some things you cannot fake.

1078
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:36,569
I mean even with All
those hormone shots

1079
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:39,948
and everything, a real
woman can always tell.

1080
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,574
Can you imagine

1081
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:43,576
what Sal Andretti would say

1082
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:45,995
if he knew his partner fell

1083
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:48,957
for a female
impersonator? Huh?

1084
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,959
Check under the bed?

1085
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,627
Yes.

1086
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:54,587
Now...

1087
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:57,173
I know he's supposed
to protect you,

1088
00:52:57,383 --> 00:53:01,177
but does he have to stay
in the same suite with us?

1089
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:04,597
I mean, I just keep
expecting him to break in

1090
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:07,600
while we're, uh,
we're making love.

1091
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:10,603
He'd only do that if he
heard something unusual,

1092
00:53:10,813 --> 00:53:12,814
like if I got excited.

1093
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,817
Well, you...
You big jerk...

1094
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:19,612
listen to me, you creep.

1095
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:22,532
You mind your own business...

1096
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:23,741

1097
00:53:26,162 --> 00:53:27,620
Good evening, sir.

1098
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:29,497
[Toddy]

I'd probably ask you

I was your moll.
