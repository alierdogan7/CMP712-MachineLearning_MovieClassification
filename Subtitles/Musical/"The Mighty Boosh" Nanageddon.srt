167
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,298
Well done. I knew it.
You always have to spoil it, don't you?

168
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,978
I knew I should have gone
for the Gothic three-way.

169
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,534
It's not my fault.
You summoned up Granny Scroggins.

170
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,059
Where is she?

171
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,815
(DOOR OPENING)

172
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,659
-It's Naboo.
-Go on, put his book back or he'll kill you.

173
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,577
-Where's it gone?
-I don't know.

174
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,134
-What are we going to do?
-Act natural.

175
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:44,129
The thing I like about jazz was the movement
from bebop to modal jazz in the late '50s,

176
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,979
where they made more of a use
of the flat nine chord.

177
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,852
-Very fascinating.
-And....

178
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,299
-Hey, guys.
-Hey!

179
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,698
-How was the Rollerdisco?
-I was on fire, banging out tune after tune.

180
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,130
-Yeah. Drop any weather report?
-Get stuffed.

181
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,375
Fair enough.

182
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,697
Naboo, you are looking good today.
You been working out?

183
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,333
You're looking taut, fit and svelte.

184
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,371
We love you, Naboo.
I don't know if we mentioned that.

185
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,968
Love what you're about, you know,
all the aspects of you.

186
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,456
-You're a powerful character.
-Have you been going through my stuff?

187
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,452
-No.
-I knew it. I told you not to mess with the occult.

188
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,174
-Sorry about that.
-What have you done?

189
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,576
-We might have summoned up a tiny demon.
-Demonette.

190
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,577
I don't believe this.

191
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,938
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

192
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,294
Hey, Naboo, sorry about that.

193
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,138
-Get out.
-Oh, come on, Naboo.

194
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,093
You've gone too far this time.
I'm going to have to turn my back on you.

195
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,173
-Sorry, Naboo.
-Come on, don't be like that.

196
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,933
Let that be a lesson to you.
Right, let's sort this mess out.

197
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,338
This is Spotlight for Demons. They're all in here.

198
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,213
-What are we looking for? Horns?
-VINCE: No.

199
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,218
-Green skin?
-Not really. Just a little old lady.

200
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,570
-What?
-A harmless old woman, you know.

201
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,689
Not this one?

202
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,139
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

203
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,493
Yeah, that's her.
I was getting quite a good vibe off her, actually.

204
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,088
-You summoned Nanatoo.
-Nanatoo?

205
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,691
She's the evilest demon known to man.
She's got five stars.

206
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,139
Is that bad?

207
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,728
We're going to have to reverse the spell.
Where's the book?

208
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,409
Right, er...have you got a copy of that book?

209
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,690
-7,000 years old.
-Right.

210
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,380
Yeah, Naboo, you might want to start
backing your stuff up.

211
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,456
I don't think you realise what you've done.

212
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,969
If Nanatoo gets the book, she's going to multiply.

213
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,056
Raise an evil army of Nanas.

214
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,377
There'll be blood on the streets,
there'll be fire in the sky.

215
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,377
You know what this means?

216
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,819
Nanageddon!

217
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,696
-Excuse me.
-What do you want, Wrinkles?

218
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,818
(SCREAMING)

219
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,098
When you are the moon,

220
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,610
the best for you can be is a full moon...

221
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,859
and then a half moon, he's all right.

222
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,369
But the full moon is the famous moon,

223
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,219
and, like, three quarters,

224
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,490
no one gives a shit about him.

225
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:35,455
When does he come?
Two days into the calendar month. He's useless.

226
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,569
Full moon, the moon.

227
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,819
The main moon.

228
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,177
It saddens me to see you
under these circumstances, Naboo.

229
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,814
You have been summoned
before the Board of Shaman

230
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,056
for the most grievous of crimes.

231
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:00,458
You let the book of spells
fall into the hands of the demon Nanatoo.

232
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,457
This is Nanageddon.

233
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,252
-It's Nanageddon.
-Nanageddon.

234
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,338
-Nanageddon.
-I wasn't even there, I was DJing with Bollo.

235
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,657
-DJing with your familiar?
-Highly unorthodox behaviour, Naboo.

236
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,974
Even for you.

237
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,251
These two guys I live with,
they tried to use the book to impress these girls.

238
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,575
''Oh, I'm Naboo. Nothing is ever my fault.''

239
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,019
What's it go to do with you?

240
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,290
It's got everything to do with me,
and more to boot.

241
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,853
-You've never liked me, have you?
-No.

242
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,732
-And you're perfect?
-I'm pretty good.

243
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,328
I've seen your CV, there's nothing on it.
I live my life.

244
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,338
Live your life?
You live with a couple of doss bags and an ape.

245
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,449
(GROWLING)

246
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,571
-What? You are an ape.
-Oh, well, yeah.

247
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,692
Yeah, you've read all the books,
but when it comes to the crunch, where are you?

248
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,412
The crunch?
How dare you speak to me of the crunch?

249
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,213
You know nothing of the crunch,
you've never even been to the crunch.

250
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,808
-I've been there once.
-Oh, a little day trip round the crunch.

251
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,329
We can all go as tourists.
''Oh, that's a bit of crunch....''

252
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,575
Shut it!

253
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,214
Look, I'll sort it out. Just give me more time.

254
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,457
Well, perhaps I could grant you an extra 24 hours.

255
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,093
-How can you allow this?
-Here we go.

256
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,654
He's guilty. It is written in the Law of the Shaman

257
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,499
that if you lose the book,
your powers will be suspended.

258
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,613
-I know this.
-This is an outrage. You must do your duty.

259
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,776
-He must be punished.
-He must be punished.

260
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,978
-He must be punished.
-He must be punished.

261
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,294
Silence.

262
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,931
-I'm afraid, on this occasion, Saboo and....
-Tony.

263
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,415
-Tony....
-Harrison.

264
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,531
...Tony Harrison are right.

265
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,414
Your powers must be revoked
and your familiar impounded until further notice.

266
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,328
-Oh, but I DJ at Fabric on Tuesday.
-Not anymore you don't.

267
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,418
-Can I still get on the guest list?
-Maybe.

268
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,577
And now, though it pains me to do this,

269
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,608
we must all turn our backs upon you.

270
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,256
Look, I'll get the book back, you'll see.
I won't let you down.

271
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,859
I'm Naboo, that's who.

272
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,208
Whatever.

273
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,059
You plum, Naboo, your powers have been revoked.

274
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,330
Yeah? I've got a travelcard.

275
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,219
I will get that book for you, sire.

276
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,412
But it is a dangerous mission.
I shall assign you a partner.

277
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,372
Very well, I will go with Kirk.

278
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,491
Kirk is not to be trusted in these matters.

279
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,772
Kirk is a violent and sexually
deranged being from the fourth dimension.

280
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,735
Kirk, is it true you are still an erotic adventurer
of the most deranged kind?

281
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,534
-Yes.
-Very well. Who shall I go with?

282
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,254
You shall go with Tony Harrison there.

283
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,293
Oh, come on.

284
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,532
What's your beef?

285
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,174
He's got not legs. He can't walk.

286
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,815
How dare you?
I come fully equipped with a papoose.

287
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,649
If you need to move me around,
I slot in the back like a peanut.

288
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,611
If you're against the papoose system,

289
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,574
I've got a wheel that clicks into my chin
like a skate.

290
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,928
What are you, a kit?

291
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,699
Am I going to have to assemble this Kinder Egg
and take him with me?

292
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,971
-Tony has a gift for strategy.
-A gift for strategy?

293
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,091
That's right, I'm a unique thinker.

294
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,735
Right, let us hear
one of Tony Harrison's stratagems.

295
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,250
Come on, Tony. Don't let me down.

296
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,816
I say we move with haste,

297
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,817
we retrieve that book,

298
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,489
we fetch it back...in a bag,

299
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,851
and quite quickly.

300
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,969
Oh, dear.

301
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,489
Just give me five minutes,
I can come up with something else.

302
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,374
I only need pen and paper
and someone to write down my ideas.

303
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,489
You are a knob.

304
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,772
Oh, if I was a younger man, I'd take you on.
Come on, let's see what you've got.

305
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:33,655
Look, I can't have this kind of guy in the field
when I'm trying to work.

306
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,214
You shall go with Tony Harrison
and that is the end of it.

307
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:40,049
Very well, sire. But if,
when it comes to the crunch, he lets me down,

308
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,375
I shall hold you personally responsible.

309
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,731
Likewise. If this prick screws up,
I'll ditch him quick smart.

310
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,498
For somebody who looks like a ball, you really....

311
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,612
Sometimes I wonder at the team
I have assembled here.

312
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:58,135
Oh, excuse me, sir,
could you tell me the way to Brick Lane?

313
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,899
Yeah, sure, what you do is,
you go down there and....

314
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,209
-You've ruined me.
-Hey, Naboo, how's it going?

315
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,696
I told you not to look in the book,
but you had to have a little look, didn't you?

316
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,936
-He's off his face.
-I know. What's the matter, Naboo?

317
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,574
-They've taken away my powers.
-What?

318
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,656
I just spent six hours on the Northern line.

319
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,816
-Look, Naboo, maybe we can help you out.
-You've done enough.

320
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,453
Sorry about all this, Naboo.

321
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:32,459
I'm going to have to turn my back on you now
once and for all.

322
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,609
What are we going to do? He's in a right state.

323
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,492
I'll tell you what we're going to do.

324
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,339
We got him into this
and we're going to get him out of it.

325
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,577
We're going to track down that old woman,
we're going to find that book,

326
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,533
we're going to bring it back
and we're going to restore Naboo's powers.

327
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,254
Yeah, but how are we going to find that old lady?
She could be anywhere.

328
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,291
Old Comanche Indian saying,

329
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,173
''Best way to hide a leaf is in a forest.''

330
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,938
You think she's in the forest?

331
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,978
-You're a bit done-up, aren't you?
-Exactly, that's my look.

332
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,898
I'm trying to look like a nana
who was quite saucy in the '50s.

333
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,375
-Glamour nana.
-We're supposed to be blending in.

334
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,572
Oh, really? What, like you with your moustache?

335
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,889
Listen.... It's those girls.

336
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,215
-Ladies.
-Nice outfits.

337
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,650
Yeah, I've still got the magic.

338
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,611
Hey, Howard, isn't that the old lady?

339
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,653
-I don't know, they all look the same.
-It is. Leave this to me.

340
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,177
-Listen, lady, where's the book?
-What book, dear?

341
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,530
Don't give me the runaround,
you know what I'm talking about.

342
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,299
-I really don't know what you mean.
-Give me it.

343
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,854
-Howard, rough her up a bit.
-What?

344
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,129
Go on.

345
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,815
Howard, she hasn't got it.
It's just a selection of cakes.

346
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,415
Sorry.

347
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,419
-Left or right, Tony?
-Uh....

348
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,053
-Left or right?
-All right.

349
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,011
It's a simple question, left or right.

350
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,096
I can't work under this kind of pressure.

351
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,371
Great, brilliant, we've overshot.
Well done, Tony Harrison. Very good.

352
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,853
What, we missed the turning?

353
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,813
We're gonna have to go all the way round now
'cause it's a one-way deal.

354
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,171
-You absolute jerk-off.
-How dare you, you cleft?

355
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,372
You've got one job, Tony, one job,
and that's to read the map.

356
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,333
My navigational skills are second to none.

357
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,099
It's just that you put the map
too far away from me.

358
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,973
I'm sorry, Tony, I'm sorry.
I'm just used to working with people

359
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,295
with a little bit more than a one-foot reach.

360
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,536
Where are we? What are we going to do?

361
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,289
-We could ask someone.
-Who are we going to ask? The moon?

362
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,292
That's not a bad idea.

363
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,537
-Fine, let's ask the moon.
-Let's do it, then.

364
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,653
One time, I saw a man looking at me,

365
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,135
yes, with his eyes,

366
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,013
and then he picked up a tube

367
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,740
and he look in the tube

368
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,772
and he made the moon big inside the tube.

369
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,175
The moon big inside the tube.

370
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,371
Oh, a telescope.

371
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,894
You see, that is why you do not ask the moon.

372
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,612
Listen, I took a chance, all right?

373
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,210
We asked the moon,
I didn't know he was an alabaster retard, did I?

374
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,456
You are a disgrace, Tony.

375
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,652
-To be honest, I feel a little bit sick.
-Oh.

376
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:32,090
-I do suffer from motion sickness.
-Oh, really, do you?

377
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,018
You should see me on coaches, it's even worse.

378
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,849
-Well, that's dynamite, Tony.
-As for ferries, I'm all over the shop.

379
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,813
When me and Mrs Harrison go to Calais,
it's a nightmare.

380
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,851
I'm on the deck the whole time.

381
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,698
Take me through every mode of transportation

382
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,732
and how each one makes you hurl, Tony,
while we're lost so....

383
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,976
Horses. I'm good on horses.

384
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,853
If you can't even handle a little carpet,

385
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,016
what are you going to do
when we come to the crunch?

386
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:00,531
Oh, my word! Are we back to the crunch?

387
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,652
-The crunch, what are you going to do?
-Oh, here we fucking go.

388
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,136
The crunch this, the crunch that.
Why are you so obsessed with the crunch?

389
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,251
-Do you want to know about the crunch?
-I do, yes.

390
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,929
Because you are going to meet the crunch
a little bit before me, my friend.

391

392

Saboo, you slag!

394
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,210
Good evening, ladies, and welcome to the bingo.

395
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,935
May I say you're all looking lovely this evening,

396
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,573
especially you.

397
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,096
Anyway, let's get started....

398

-He's a bit forward, isn't he?
-He could have been talking about me.

399
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,098
Yeah, right.

Two bloody stumps, number 1 1 .

403
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:57,055
The age I lost my virginity, number 4 3.

404
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,536
-Is that her?
-Hmm?

405
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,732
Vince, is that her?

406
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,852
Can you be quiet? I keep missing the numbers.

407
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,938
Do you remember why we're here?

408
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,858
I know, but look at those boots. They're genius.

409
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,210
If I get them, I'm going to customise them.

410
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,252
-Vince, what colour was her cardigan?
-Hmm?

411
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,338
-What colour was her cardigan?
-Red.

412
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,020
I think that's her. I'm going to try something.

413
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,493
-Stay there.
-Yeah, yeah.

Howdy doody, bouncing clown, number 75.

421
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,894
-I'll take that.
-Who are you?

422
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,375
-I'm from the Board of Shaman.
-I'm taking this to Naboo.

423
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,139
Naboo? Haven't you heard, he's washed-up,
he's finished, he's a drunk.

424
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,012
-He's a friend of mine.
-Everyone's a friend of Naboo.

425
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,574
-Yeah, well, he's a nice man.
-He knows nothing of the crunch.

426
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,258
-The what?
-He knows nothing of the crunch.

427
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,496
What's that got to do with anything?
What are you doing?

428
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,497
-That's your first slice of crunch.
-Get off.

429
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,532
I'll slap you with the crunch.
I'll bury you in the crunch.

430
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,299
-House!
-We have a winner.

431
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,010
Hey, Howard, I won the boots.

432
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,449
