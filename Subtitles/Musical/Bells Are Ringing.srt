00:07:04,433 --> 00:07:08,103
l can't spend my whole lífe
waítíng for hím to take me to the racest

67
00:07:08,266 --> 00:07:10,101
For heaven's sake.

68
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:11,867
''The races!''

69
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:15,102
That's all he needs
is to be taken to the races.

70
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:17,501
As if he hasn't got enough trouble now.

71
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,967
Ella.

72
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:23,268
When are you gonna stop
worrying about that playboy?

73
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:26,302
He's not a playboy.
He's a very talented playwright.

74
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:29,402
All he does is play. he never writes.

75
00:07:29,566 --> 00:07:31,067
l beg your pardon?

76
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:36,538
He and his partner have written most of
the successful successes on Broadway.

77
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,868
So. what's his problem?

78
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:42,201
-His partner left him.
-So?

79
00:07:42,366 --> 00:07:44,067
He has to write alone.

80
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,935
So let him write alone. Big deal.

81
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,236
Don't you see what that
can mean to somebody?

82
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:53,603
He's terrified that he might not
be able to make it alone.

83
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:56,034
-He's sensitive. he's creative.
-Hi. girls.

84
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:58,802
Hi. He's artistic.

85
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:06,535
Oh. Ella.

86
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,568
Look at this.

87
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:12,503
Miss Number 63 is canceling service...

88
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,235
...because she's marrying Mr. Number 78.

89
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,635
Oh. how wonderful.

90
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,801
l had nothing to do with it.

91
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:24,637
l happened to know that Miss Number 63
wanted to mate her female Siamese cat.

92
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,570
And l also knew that Mr. Number 78
had a male Siamese cat.

93
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:31,235
So l told her. and she called him...

94
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:34,202
-...and they all got together.
-The fact remains...

95
00:08:34,366 --> 00:08:37,836
...we now have one account
instead of two.

96
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,402
Ella. l have told you a thousand times...

97
00:08:40,566 --> 00:08:43,702
...just give and take messages. That's all.

98
00:08:43,866 --> 00:08:48,670
Don't be so helpful to the subscribers.
It could get us into trouble.

99
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,469
Why don't you help yourself
and get yourself a man?

100
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:56,403
Ella. what are you doing here?
l made that date for you at 5:OO.

101
00:08:56,566 --> 00:08:59,869
-Do l have to go?
-Do you have...?

102
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:05,303
Ella. this is the sixth young man
l've dredged up this year.

103
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:09,369
He's a very nice young man.
He's the nephew of my dearest friend...

104
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:11,935
...so please make an effort.

105
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,035
All right.

106
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,201
Ella.

107
00:09:17,366 --> 00:09:19,334
All right.

108
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:31,804
Don't forget to wake Jeffrey Moss up
in time for his appointment.

109
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:40,870
All that yakety-yak at the board. yet
every time she goes out with a real fella...

110
00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:43,435
-...she clams up like an oyster.
-She's a little shy.

111
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,502
-Her fingers turn into thumbs.
-lt takes a little while--

112
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,268
-She knocks things over. spills drinks.
-Maybe--

113
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:53,770
The only thing she
hasn't done is catch on fire.

114
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,201
Miss Pringle's residence.

115
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:02,037
l couldn't possibly hold a table
for that length of time. l have reservations--

116
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,735
-Let me look.
-Captain. captain.

117
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:07,035
-One moment.
-Will we get our table soon?

118
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,902
-l'll check as soon as l can.
-We've been waiting.

119
00:10:10,066 --> 00:10:13,002
l'm afraid my date
is going to die of starvation.

120
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:16,135
-l'll check as soon as l can.
-Would you. please? Thank you.

121
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:19,903
Hello. Mr. Chase?
Yes. 10:1 5. a party of four.

122
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:23,736
-That's the best l can do.
-l seem to have picked out the wrong place.

123
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:26,569
They're so busy here. we may
have to do our own cooking.

124
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:30,870
Anyway. we have these. Now. if we
could just get our table. Captain?

125
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:35,669
You're being an awfully
good sport about all this.

126
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,834
Well. Iet's have a toast to friendship.

127
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,768
Friendship is the gift of the--

128
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:41,801
-l'm sorry.
-Oh. l'm sorry.

129
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:44,401
Just when l'm trying
to make a good impression.

130
00:10:44,566 --> 00:10:46,801
-Oh. l'll get it.
-Oh. no. l'll get--

131
00:10:46,966 --> 00:10:48,901
-Oh. it's--
-Sorry. l--

132
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,767
l hope l didn't hurt you.

133
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:54,236
You'll think l'm an awful oaf.

134
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,335
l'd better get another drink.

135
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,668
-Oh. no. take this one.
-No. you keep that.

136
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,569
-No. no. no.
-Let's share it. then.

137
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:03,701
-All right.
-You take the first sip.

138
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:06,902
lt's getting so late.
l wish they'd-- Oh. captain.

139
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,034
Oh. it is getting late.

140
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,535
Oh. l missed him again.

141
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:18,202
You know. l'm not usually this clumsy.

142
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:20,768
lf you wanna know the truth.
l'm a little nervous.

143
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:23,035
Blind dates don't usually
turn out this well.

144
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,769
And l approached this date
with some trepidation.

145
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:27,968
l've had some terrible experiences.

146
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:31,503
You know. my aunt. bless her.
but she and some of her friends...

147
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,502
...including. if you'll forgive me.
your cousin Sue...

148
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,235
...have come up with
some of the most awful dog--

149
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:40,035
Excuse me. some of the strangest girls.

150
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,468
So when you showed up....

151
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:46,768
You know. you're a good listener.

152
00:11:46,933 --> 00:11:48,734
That's an art in itself.

153
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,602
Helps to build the other person's ego.

154
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,436
l guess you must be thinking
that l'm kind of garrulous...

155
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,269
...the way l've monopolized
the conversation. but--

156
00:11:58,433 --> 00:12:01,702
-Oh. captain.
-l'm checking on your table right now. sir.

157
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:04,468
Oh. thank you. that's--

158
00:12:04,633 --> 00:12:06,568
Oh. l'm sorry.

159
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:09,402
-Your table is ready now. This way. please.
-Thank you.

160
00:12:09,566 --> 00:12:11,167
Good. we can go now--

161
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:14,634
-Oh. l'm sorry.
-Really. it's all right.

162
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,034
Oh. l'm sorry.

163
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,269
l guess nothing else can happen to us.

164
00:12:19,433 --> 00:12:23,170
You have days where nothing goes right.
That happened to me last week.

165
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,935
-From the first thing in--
-l'm terribly sorry.

166
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,968
My fault. madam.

167
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,370
Anyway. it's possible that the stars
have something to do with that.

168
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:35,935
l've read about that....

169
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,468
Well. you just beat your own record.

170
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:51,568
Door to door in 45 minutes.

171
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:53,468
-How'd it go?
-Oh. fine.

172
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:56,102
My date suddenly remembered
a pressing engagement.

173
00:12:56,266 --> 00:12:57,600
With a tailor?

174
00:12:57,766 --> 00:13:00,802
-Yes.
-Well. what happened?

175
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:07,401
Dr. Stafford's office.

176
00:13:07,566 --> 00:13:11,336
-Thís ís Mrs. Herman.
-Oh. Mrs. Herman.

177
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,102

178
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:18,237
...so don't eat when you wake up.

179
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,934
-Thanh you.
-Goodbye.

180
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,969
-Hey. Gwynne. where's Sue?
-You're safe.

181
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:25,535
-She's out with Otto.
-Who?

182
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,071
-You know. that European recording guy.
-Oh. good.

183
00:13:30,366 --> 00:13:33,469
l put a file in this bread
in case you wanna break out of here.

184
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:35,468
-Hi. Carl.
-Hi.

185
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:39,670

to treat you to a soda at the drugstore.

186
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,701

00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,502
-Thanks.
-Did you remember to wake Jeffrey Moss?

189
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:52,470
l tried. The sleeping prince
said to call him again at 6:OO.

190
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:55,769
But that means he didn't keep
his appointment with his producer.

191
00:13:55,933 --> 00:13:59,736
Ella. he's only a disembodied voice.
remember?

192
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:03,937
Jeffrey Moss is just Plaza O-4433.

193
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,803
He doesn't mean any more
than any other subscriber to me.

194
00:14:09,066 --> 00:14:11,668
Six o'clock. l have to wake him.

195
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:24,767
Yeah.

196
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:46,702

One moment. please.

200
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:59,204
Ella. aren't you ever gonna give up
that old lady's voice you use on him?

201
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:00,900
He needs a mother.

202
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,035

264
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,769
Or chew the old fat-eroo.

265
00:19:33,766 --> 00:19:35,834
Mom. l'm scared.

266
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,968
Oh. you mustn't be.

...but this is it.
This is my last chance.

Now. you sit down and finish that outline.

Mom. you really care
what happens to me. don't you?

00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,902
No ax to grind.

Not like the bunch of phonies
that l pal around with.

277

Here it is.

310
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:19,669
The minute one of those girls gets
on the phone. turn on the tape recorder.

311
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:22,135
Are you sure about this.
Inspector Barnes?

312
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:24,769
Mr. Barnes. you meathead.

313
00:23:24,933 --> 00:23:27,769
l'm gonna get a promotion
for closing up this joint.

314
00:23:27,933 --> 00:23:31,569
Just because the law arrested
all those girls at All-Alone-A-Phone...

315
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:34,769
.. .doesn't mean every
answering service is a front for...

316
00:23:34,933 --> 00:23:38,336
-...a lonely-hearts club.
-Come on.

317
00:24:00,033 --> 00:24:02,101
How do you do?

318
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:06,536
My name is Barnes. We're doing a little
article on the answering services.

319
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,601
We're from...

320
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,068
... Vogue magazine.

321
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:13,868
We'd just like to ask you
a couple of questions.

322
00:24:14,033 --> 00:24:15,300
-Vogue_
-Yes.

323
00:24:15,466 --> 00:24:19,770
Me? Oh. well. thank you.
l'd be glad to.

324
00:24:19,933 --> 00:24:22,669
-Won't you sit down?
-No. thank you. We'll stand.

325
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:25,902
-l'll be with you in a minute.
-Alrighty.

326
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:30,403
Now. tell me. do you enjoy
doing this line of work?

327
00:24:30,566 --> 00:24:35,671
Oh. l love it here. l used to be a plain
switchboard operator in a lingerie house.

328
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:39,970
Pretty dull. except for a little
modeling on the side.

329
00:24:40,133 --> 00:24:43,436
Modeling on the side. huh?

330
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:47,904
But this is so much more personal. l come
into contact with so many different types...

331
00:24:48,066 --> 00:24:51,169
...and l can give each one

511
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:32,338

Goodbye. Iady.

...that my evil habits are no concern

-What work?
-lf you wanna drink at this hour...

602
00:44:25,166 --> 00:44:27,668
...there must be some work
you're trying to avoid.

603
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:30,001
l know from my own experience.

604
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:33,802
ln high school. l'd do anything
to keep from doing my homework.

605
00:44:33,966 --> 00:44:39,104
Mostly. l'd sharpen pencils. You know.
the yellow kind that says ''Ticonderoga''?

606
00:44:39,266 --> 00:44:43,103
Well. l'd sharpen it to the ''Ticonderog.''
and then to the ''Ticonder''...

607
00:44:43,266 --> 00:44:46,936
...and then to the ''Ticond.''
then to the ''Tic.'' then to the ''Ti'' ...

608
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:49,502
...and then to the ''T.''

609
00:44:49,666 --> 00:44:52,135
Then l'd have to start on another pencil.

610
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:56,337
Anything but face that awful blank page.

611
00:44:57,699 --> 00:45:01,003
-Oh. yeah.
-Oh. sure. go ahead. Drink.

612
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:05,103
-Ruin your last chance.
-Last chan-- Last chance to do what?

613
00:45:05,266 --> 00:45:09,303
Well. whatever it's your last chance
to do. You look desperate to me.

614
00:45:09,466 --> 00:45:11,801
l'm about to be ill.

615
00:45:11,966 --> 00:45:15,703
You wouldn't happen to have
a cup of coffee on you?

616
00:45:15,866 --> 00:45:18,168
Yes. l would.

617
00:45:26,533 --> 00:45:29,335
And a cheese Danish?

618
00:45:30,233 --> 00:45:32,134
Prune.

619
00:45:33,133 --> 00:45:36,536
-Oh. listen. Miss...?
-Scott.

620
00:45:36,699 --> 00:45:39,035
Melisande.

621
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,035
Moss. Jeffrey.

622
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:46,737
-Sit down. Miss Scott.
-No. l can't because l have to go.

623
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:56,037
Oh. well. now that my vision
has cleared up a bit...

624
00:45:56,199 --> 00:46:00,604
...and l'm beginning to see shapes
and colors at more than 6 inches away...

625
00:46:00,766 --> 00:46:03,368
...you're beginning to look
pretty good to me...

626
00:46:03,533 --> 00:46:07,904
...since l haven't anything to do
for the next 10.OOO years....

627
00:46:08,066 --> 00:46:11,102
That's just another way
of avoiding your work. Girls.

628
00:46:11,266 --> 00:46:14,302
And you do have something to do.
You have an appointment to keep.

629
00:46:14,466 --> 00:46:17,969
-Who said so?
-Your 7:OO call. Stay up and start writing.

630
00:46:18,133 --> 00:46:20,435
You can write alone.
You did it once before.

631
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:24,537
-How do you know l did it once before?
-Because anybody who's a writer...

632
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:27,569
...must have written something
by himself once.

633
00:46:27,733 --> 00:46:31,203
-Did l say l was a writer?
-No. but you're not a plumber. are you?

634
00:46:31,366 --> 00:46:33,768
-No.
-Well....

635
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:37,035
But you don't think so yourself.
or you'd be writing...

636
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:40,503
...instead of running around
and coming home at 7 in the morning...

637
00:46:40,666 --> 00:46:42,934
...and sleeping all day.

638
00:46:43,766 --> 00:46:45,701
lt's uncanny.

639
00:46:45,866 --> 00:46:48,235
-Are you plugged into me somewhere?
-No.

640
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,101
-You know me from someplace.
-No.

641
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:53,202
-You're psychic.
-Yes.

642
00:46:53,366 --> 00:46:55,301
l'm very intuitive.

643
00:46:55,466 --> 00:47:00,838
l get feelings about people. l know a lot
about you just from listening to you talk.

644
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,869
And l see visions.

645
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,403
-What's the matter?
-l see one now. It's a vision of you.

646
00:47:09,566 --> 00:47:11,901
What am l doing?

647
00:47:12,066 --> 00:47:15,736
Nothing. You're lying facedown
in the gutter.

648
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,637
-Stop it. You're scaring the hell out of me.
-Sorry. that's what l see.

649
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,537
My visions are never wrong.
unless you do something about it.

650
00:47:24,699 --> 00:47:27,169
l tried analysis.
l might as well try witchcraft.

651
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:29,268
We'll go the old witchcraft routine.

652
00:47:29,433 --> 00:47:33,570
We'll get the doll. we'll get the pins.
and the boiling water and the drums.

653
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,902
Anything you want me to do. l'll do it.

654
00:47:36,066 --> 00:47:39,402
-All right. Do as l say.
-Yeah?

655
00:47:39,566 --> 00:47:42,902
-Go to your typewriter.
-Yeah?

656
00:47:47,533 --> 00:47:50,702
-Sit down.
-Yeah?

657
00:47:53,133 --> 00:47:56,135
-And now...
-Yeah?

658
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,201
...write it.

659
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,836
l knew there was a catch to it.

660
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,503
Oh. that's enough.
You're not so badly off.

661
00:48:06,666 --> 00:48:11,470
l know a guy whose father's forcing him
to be a dentist. He wants to be a composer.

662
00:48:11,633 --> 00:48:16,537
The poor fellow sits up in an office all day
Iong composing songs on an air hose.

663

Nobody's keeping you
from doing what you want.

00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,502
Nobody except yourself.

665
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:26,202
You're afraid everybody's gonna say.
''Oh. the partner's the talented one.''

666
00:48:26,366 --> 00:48:28,267
Well. so what?

667
00:48:28,433 --> 00:48:31,469
You call other people phonies
because you hate yourself.

668
00:48:31,633 --> 00:48:36,371
You're afraid what you write isn't gonna be
important. so you don't write anything.

669
00:48:37,866 --> 00:48:40,335
Boy. do you know me.

670
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,936

00:04:16,742 --> 00:04:19,811
He liked it. Larry liked it.

717
00:04:19,975 --> 00:04:23,144
Well. of course he liked it.

718
00:04:24,042 --> 00:04:28,413
He said it's not quite written yet. and he
made me promise to go to the country...

719
00:04:28,575 --> 00:04:32,812
...and whip it. but by and large.
it's something of a miracle.

720
00:04:32,975 --> 00:04:34,609
lt's not a miracle. You did it.

721
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,510
-And you know what?
-What?

722
00:04:36,675 --> 00:04:38,176
You're the miracle.

723
00:04:39,475 --> 00:04:42,511
What's the matter? You blind?
Where do you think you're going?

724
00:04:42,675 --> 00:04:46,412
Don't give me none of that. Driving
around here. nobody takes any care.

725
00:04:46,575 --> 00:04:49,577
The light was still green.
He says it was red. It was green.

726
00:04:49,742 --> 00:04:53,579
-People. Wow.
-What'd you expect? Herrings?

727
00:04:53,742 --> 00:04:57,612
Look at them. A band of cutthroats.

728
00:04:58,675 --> 00:05:00,777
You ever see such hatred?

729
00:05:00,942 --> 00:05:05,279
lf l so much as asked one of these people
for the time. they'd turn into a lynch mob.

730
00:05:05,442 --> 00:05:09,612
Everybody wants to be friendly. only
nobody's willing to make the first move.

731
00:05:09,775 --> 00:05:12,811
Why don't you say hello
to this nice man over here?

732
00:05:12,975 --> 00:05:15,410
He'd appreciate it.

733
00:05:17,242 --> 00:05:20,712
Him? That's Dracula's uncle.
the Wolf Man.

734
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,944
The only thing he'd appreciate
would be a nice. fresh cup of blood.

735
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:27,778
Oh. it's so easy.
All you have to do is say hello.

736
00:05:27,942 --> 00:05:29,610

A wonderful gírl

To recommend her for a gírl

799
00:09:22,742 --> 00:09:25,644
Fabulous creature

She's íust a gírl
An everyday gírl

802
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:35,110
And yet l guess she's really
Rather specíal for a gírl

803
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:37,944
For once you have seen her
The others are out

804
00:09:38,442 --> 00:09:41,211
Hey, what am l gettíng
So excíted about?

805
00:09:41,675 --> 00:09:47,080
But so what? What has she got
Others have not?

806
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:53,981
Two eyes, two líps, a nose
All gírls have some of those

807
00:09:54,608 --> 00:10:00,246
But when she looks up at me
What do l see?

808
00:10:00,675 --> 00:10:05,946
The most enchantíng face
My pulse begíns to race

819
00:11:08,908 --> 00:11:12,945
But if he could only sell one song.

820
00:11:13,108 --> 00:11:17,045

949
00:22:11,275 --> 00:22:16,446

958
00:22:59,308 --> 00:23:01,176
-So tell him.
-lt's impossible.

959
00:23:01,342 --> 00:23:05,312
What's impossible? You're making
yourself miserable over nothing.

960
00:23:06,675 --> 00:23:08,543
-Nothing.
-Sure. nothing.

961
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:11,043

Goodbye. Goodbye.

999
00:25:46,475 --> 00:25:48,710
How did you know
about her and the races?

1000
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:52,345
lt's written all over her face.
She even looks a little like a horse.

1001
00:25:55,942 --> 00:25:57,843
l can't believe you're really here.

1002
00:26:03,075 --> 00:26:05,377

Oh. wonderful. Wait till you see this.
l rewrote the whole first act...

1008
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:31,011
...and l more or less have
a rough draft for the rest of it.

1009
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:34,878
l hope you don't sue me. but you know
that dentist you were telling me about?

1010
00:26:35,042 --> 00:26:37,544
Well. l wrote him into the play.

1011
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:39,976
That's wonderful.

1012
00:26:44,108 --> 00:26:46,710
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

1013
00:26:47,142 --> 00:26:49,244
-Mel.
-Oh. don't.

1014
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:52,277
What is this?
What did you come here for?

1015
00:26:52,442 --> 00:26:54,844
-l thought you needed a secretary.
-Secretary!

1016
00:26:55,008 --> 00:26:56,809
You're pretty well fixed for girls.

1017

1018

-Nothing.

1019
00:27:01,242 --> 00:27:03,444
-Oh. come on.
-A thousand dollars an hour.

1020
00:27:03,608 --> 00:27:07,945
That's reasonable enough.
Now sit down. Sit down.

1021
00:27:08,308 --> 00:27:11,611
l promise l'll keep my grimy
paws off of you.

1022

Mel.

1026
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:29,044
l don't know what you think
you walked in on.

1027
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:31,076
lt wasn't anything at all.

1028
00:27:31,242 --> 00:27:33,477
You probably don't care
whether it was or not...

1029
00:27:33,642 --> 00:27:36,578
...and you obviously think
l'm still with girls. girls--

1030
00:27:36,742 --> 00:27:39,344
But l'm trying to tell you
that l've changed.

1031
00:27:39,508 --> 00:27:41,943
l think l've finally found the one.

You drop into my life like a miracle.

1036
00:27:52,342 --> 00:27:56,345
You just can't toss me

Mel. l love you.

1038
00:28:55,475 --> 00:28:57,076
All right?

1039
00:28:57,408 --> 00:29:00,177
Do you think we should have left this on?

1040
00:29:05,242 --> 00:29:07,310
-Too much?
-Yeah.

1041
00:29:07,842 --> 00:29:10,110

1241
00:43:04,175 --> 00:43:06,210
l say if you don't have wall space for it...

1242
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:09,144
...just move and get yourself
a place with the wall space.

1243
00:43:09,308 --> 00:43:11,243
You'll never regret it. my dear.

1244
00:43:11,408 --> 00:43:14,344
They're the most absolute riot
of color. my dear.

1245
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:19,980
And they're all tans and plums and olives.
And they're all pictures of eyes.

1246
00:43:20,142 --> 00:43:24,145
Open eyes. closed eyes. blinking eyes.
crossed eyes. eyes crying...

1247

l don't know your specifications.
That's the only--

Wait a minute. this is a London call.
We gotta straighten this out.

1252
00:43:39,042 --> 00:43:40,276
He's a hack. Iet's face it.

1253
00:43:40,442 --> 00:43:43,278
Without Jeff. those plays wouldn't
have gotten off the ground.

1254
00:43:43,442 --> 00:43:46,812
-Jeff has the brilliance. the flair. the wit--
-A wonderful ear.

1255
00:43:46,975 --> 00:43:50,378
-That's the difference.
-Wonderful ear. You have it or you don't.

1256
00:43:50,575 --> 00:43:52,176
You've got to be born with it.

1257
00:43:52,342 --> 00:43:55,878
-What a beautiful talent.
-And what a great human being.

1258
00:43:56,042 --> 00:43:57,276

1259
00:43:58,008 --> 00:43:59,309

-Hang up when we get downstairs.

1261
00:44:02,242 --> 00:44:04,744
Look. we've got to
get this straightened out.

1262
00:44:08,975 --> 00:44:12,745
Time me. and l'll be back
in 30 seconds flat.

1263
00:44:16,008 --> 00:44:18,310
What is that?

1264
00:44:19,442 --> 00:44:21,577
What is what?

1265
00:44:23,775 --> 00:44:26,077
l don't think it's a play for a British director.

1266
00:44:26,342 --> 00:44:30,345
Well. it was the big night of my life.

00:58:04,908 --> 00:58:07,644
...but it's something big.

1444
00:58:31,075 --> 00:58:33,010
My father didn't want me
to be a composer.

1445
00:58:33,175 --> 00:58:35,977

1451
00:58:53,208 --> 00:58:56,778
That's what's holding up the play.

-l remember. l got the title from that girl.
-What girl?

1457

-...5'6''. big brown eyes--
-Wait a minute. Wait a second here!

1464
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:43,145
That's how l got the chance
to do the part in your play.

1465
00:59:43,308 --> 00:59:47,578
This girl comes up to me and tells me
about myself. the clothes and the whole bit.

She changes my life. l get the part.

-Let's go.
-Wait a second.

1471
00:59:59,575 --> 01:00:02,878
That girl is the same girl

1484
01:00:43,575 --> 01:00:47,412

The subscribers won't even know l've gone.

...Mrs. Mallet called twice

...playing all sorts of imaginary characters.

1519
01:03:47,875 --> 01:03:51,411
They became even more real to me
than l was.

1520
01:03:51,975 --> 01:03:54,944
Jeff fell in love with one of them...

1521

Why. Otto. what's the matter?

1571
01:08:03,675 --> 01:08:06,310
This is impossible.
Who could have done this?

1572
01:08:06,475 --> 01:08:09,611
Who switched these orders from
Beethoven's 10th to Beethoven's 9th?

1573
01:08:09,775 --> 01:08:13,378
l did. Beethoven only wrote
nine symphonies.

1574
01:08:14,142 --> 01:08:16,944
You idiot! You put all the money
on the wrong horse.

1575
01:08:17,108 --> 01:08:19,143
l was almost bumped off for this
by the mob.

1576
01:08:19,308 --> 01:08:20,542
Shut up.

1577
01:08:20,708 --> 01:08:25,712
To think my simple. little bookie system
can be loused up by this dumb broad.

1578
01:08:25,875 --> 01:08:28,277
-Horses?
-Bookies!

1579
01:08:28,442 --> 01:08:31,678
Otto. is that what l gave you
all that money for?

1580
01:08:31,842 --> 01:08:34,177
-Sue. you didn't.
-That's swell. Ioudmouth.

1581
01:08:34,342 --> 01:08:37,244
-Now these dames know all about it.
-They can't talk.

1582
01:08:37,408 --> 01:08:42,546
One peep out of them. and the cops will put
them in jail and close up Susanswerphone.

1583
01:08:42,708 --> 01:08:45,110
-Let's go! The money!
-My life savings!

1584
01:08:45,275 --> 01:08:48,411
-Ella. please do something!
-Shut up!

1585
01:08:53,208 --> 01:08:54,842
-They don't get it.
-Get what?

1586
01:08:55,008 --> 01:08:56,776
Shut up!

1587
01:08:58,375 --> 01:09:01,678
-Okay. Otto. your number's up.
-Ridiculous.

1588
01:09:01,842 --> 01:09:06,446
Oh. no. Remember Mr. Barnes
of Vogue magazine?

1589
01:09:06,608 --> 01:09:09,610
-Vogue_
-He's not Mr. Barnes. He's Inspector Barnes.

1590
01:09:09,775 --> 01:09:13,712
And the cops know about this
whole layout. It's a trap!

1591
01:09:14,408 --> 01:09:16,376
You're coming with us to Corvello's.

1592
01:09:16,542 --> 01:09:19,711
No. no. no. It won't be necessary
to rub us out. boys. because....

1593
01:09:19,875 --> 01:09:25,046
Because you've all been
spilling your guts into a tape recorder.

1594
01:09:32,142 --> 01:09:33,510
Where is it?

1595
01:09:33,675 --> 01:09:35,076
Where is it?

1596
01:09:35,242 --> 01:09:38,044
You think you're playing with kids?
''Where is it?''

1597
01:09:38,208 --> 01:09:40,043
Where is it?

1598
01:09:40,908 --> 01:09:43,710
lt's rigged up to the police station.
that's where.

1599
01:09:43,875 --> 01:09:46,577
And you better get going.
because as a matter of fact...

1600
01:09:46,742 --> 01:09:49,878
...lnspector Barnes
should be here any minute.

1601
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:54,111
lnspector Barnes.
Am l glad to see you.

1602
01:09:54,275 --> 01:09:57,678
-Get your toothbrush and come on along.
-My toothbrush?

1603
01:09:57,842 --> 01:10:01,045
-That's right.
-No. we can just drop that act right now.. .

1604
01:10:01,208 --> 01:10:03,944
...because l've got the whole
bookie mob right here.

1605
01:10:04,108 --> 01:10:07,845
-All you have to do is take them away.
-lnspector Barnes. l surrender happily.

1606
01:10:08,008 --> 01:10:11,344
These are two of Corvello's henchmen.
l want to congratulate you.. .

1607
01:10:11,508 --> 01:10:15,278
...for having such a brilliant ally working
with you to uncover the Corvello gang.

1608
01:10:15,442 --> 01:10:20,113
Me? l'm nothing. Small potatoes.
Corvello. he's the head of everything.

1609
01:10:20,508 --> 01:10:22,209
We only work for him.

1610
01:10:22,375 --> 01:10:24,810
-What?
-lnspector. don't you get the picture?

1611
01:10:24,975 --> 01:10:27,544
Titanic Records is a bookie operation.

1612
01:10:29,675 --> 01:10:33,578
-Take them away.
-Take them away!

1613
01:10:36,908 --> 01:10:41,879
-Farewell. my líebchen.
-Oh. Otto. how you deceived me.

01:11:07,708 --> 01:11:11,344
l told you she was a nice girl.

1618
01:11:14,275 --> 01:11:19,413
Well. is it a crime to have made
a human mistake? l misjudged you.

1619
01:11:21,575 --> 01:11:26,079
l wonder if you'd mind coming down to
the station with me. l may need your help.

1620
