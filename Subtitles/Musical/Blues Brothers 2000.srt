Tell me, who's that writing?
John the Revelator

3
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:16,867
Wrote the book of the seven seals

Wrote the book of the seven seals

7
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:36,053
You know, God walked down
In the cool of the day

8
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,931
Called Adam by his name

9
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,851
And he refused to answer

10
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:47,815
Because he's naked and ashamed

11
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:51,068
Who's that writing?
John the Revelator

12
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:55,114
Well, who's that writing?

Wrote the book of the seven seals

15
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:06,375
You know, Christ had 12 apostles

16
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,920
And three he led away

17
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:16,927
Said, "Watch me when I walk
Till I go yonder and I pray"

18
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:28,564

00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:36,196
Christ came on the Easter morning

21
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,825
Mary and Martha was down to see

22
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:46,832
Go tell my disciples
And meet me in Galilee

- Good morning, Warden.
- Tom.

31
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,289
Is that Elwood Blues?

32
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,750
Yes, sir. Released yesterday.

33
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,962
Did you tell him about Jake?

34
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,547
No, sir. I thought you told him.

35
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,826
I'm sorry.

36
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,472
(BLUES SONG PLAYING)

37
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:21,153
Listen, I work for a friend of yours.

38
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,779
Who's that?

39
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,365
Your old drummer, Willie.

40
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,659
I dance at his club.

41
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,495
They told him you were out
and he asked me to come check on you.

42
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,914
He said he'd give you a job.

43
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,086
Matara, could you drop me off here, please?

44
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,480
- What can I do for you, boy?
- Sir,

45
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,648
how much would something like

46
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:02,152
that full-sized Ford police package
in the middle there run me?

47
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:06,615
Get yourself $500
and you come back to see me then.

48
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,784
Okay, sir.

49
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,580
That's a nice car.

50
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:15,624
I'll save it for you.

51
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,001
Thanks.

52
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,389
I wasn't sure
you were going to come, Elwood.

53
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:35,143
Hey, a letter from you
is like a command, Sister. You know that.

54
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:41,316
- Actually, it's Mother Mary now.
- That's a promotion, isn't it?

55
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,028
I'm sorry to hear about Jake.

56
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:50,325
Yeah, well, I guess
he's in a much better place.

57
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,664
Uh...

58
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,582
Where is Curtis?

59
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,878
Curtis has gone on as well, Elwood.
I'm sorry.

60
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,090
So, that's why he stopped writing me.

61
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,679
He was very upset
when the orphanage closed.

62
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,683
Curtis was the closest thing to a dad
that Jake and I ever had.

63
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,185
He gave us the music.

64
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:23,191
The Lord works in mysterious ways, Elwood.
We all must go on and fight the good fight.

65
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,445
The orphanage is gone, Jake's gone,
Curtis is gone.

66
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:30,031
I got no brother, I got no roots, I got no life.
I got nothing, for Christ's sake.

67
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,201
Young man...

68
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,661
Ow!

69
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,955
...you were not taught and raised by me

70
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,417
to fold at the slightest whiff
of adverse circumstances.

71
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,795
Now quit your silly moping,

72
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,756
pull your sorry self together
and snap out of it!

73
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,133
But... (EXCLAIMS)

74
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:53,388
But nothing! Wise up!
Turn your heart to the Creator.

75
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,390
You are so quick to despair.

76
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:59,102
You are not the only person in the world
who has had tragedy in their lives.

77
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,190
You didn't know that Curtis had a son,
did you?

78
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,776
Curtis had a son?

79
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:10,947
Before Curtis came to us
at St. Helen of the Blessed Shroud

80
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:15,535
he had a musical group
that toured the juke joints of the Midwest.

81
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,831
In one town,
Curtis had an affair with a married woman.

82
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,708
Go, Curtis.

83
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:25,545
I mean, that's terrible.

84
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,756
That's what I thought you meant.

85
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,385
Anyway, the woman became pregnant
and decided to remain with her husband,

86
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,014
never telling him
that the boy child wasn't his.

87
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,849
Curtis was devastated.

88
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,310
He came to us as a custodian

89
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:45,023
and spent the rest of his life
caring for little orphans like you, Elwood.

90
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,107
(CRYING)

91
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,987
Thanks.

92
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,786
That's a beautiful story.

93
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,210
Hey, wait a minute. If Curtis had a son,

94
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:09,214
then that guy would be
kind of like my stepbrother.

95
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,632
I have a family.

96
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,969
Curtis always stayed in touch
with the boy's mother.

97
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,179
He sent his paycheck every week.

98
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,515
Where is this boy now?

99
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:22,227
He's a grown man now, Elwood,
and doing quite well.

100
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,771
Lives in the city.
His name is Cabel Chamberlain.

101
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,315
Cabel Chamberlain.

102
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:30,610
He doesn't know anything about Curtis,
and it's not your place to tell him.

103
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,571
I wouldn't say anything.

104
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,031
Do you know
anything about mentoring, Elwood?

105
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,493
No. What about it?

106
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,954
There's someone I'd like you to meet.

107
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,375
Sister, would you send Buster
in here, please?

108
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,043
Wait a minute.

109
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,336
Thank you.

110
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,715
l...

111
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,846
Come in, Buster, and sit down.

112
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,438
Elwood, say hello to Buster.

113
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,356
Hi. How ya doing?

114
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,525
Buster, say hello to Elwood.

115
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,402
Hi. How ya doing?

116
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,780
Hey, the kid's a wiseass.

117
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,450
(EXCLAIMING) Shit!

118
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,952
What did you say?

119
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:24,914
I said, what a sweet kid.

120
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:28,126
That's more like it. Now, here's my proposal.

121
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,921
Young Buster here is a ward of the state,
and due to lack of space

122
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:36,718
the archdiocese has agreed to house
homeless children here at the hospital.

123
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,346
What's that got to do with me?

124
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,599
I thought perhaps that you would
come and spend time with Buster.

125
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,979
Why don't you take Buster here to the library
in the meantime?

126
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,399
You know, I've been jacked around...

127
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,863
The library. No problem.

128
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,784
See you in two hours, boys.

129
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,454
Okay, kid, here's the deal.

130
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:07,082
You wait here
and I'll come back for you with the car.

131
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,167
Do you have a car?

132
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,503
I'm working on it.

133
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:26,017

135
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,776
- Thanks for the ride.
- Yeah, no problem.

00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,919
Hey, kid, are you stalking me?

137
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,095
What are you, 15? Seventeen?

138
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,055
I'm 10.

139
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,015
Ten, huh?

140
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,562
Look, I know what you're going through.

141
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,064
You're lonely,
searching for your place in life.

142
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,774
Just don't blow it like I did.

143
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,736
Stay away from drugs, gangs,
cyber porn on the internet,

144
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,155
and you could be
President of the United States someday.

145
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,618
But I don't want to be
President of the United States.

146
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,912
Look, I'm busy.
I got kind of a brother in there.

147
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,914
He must be in some kind of trouble.

148
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:34,794
Besides, you don't want to hang around
with some over-40 recidivist.

149
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,379
Now scram.

150
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,846
A Mr. Elwood J. Blues is here to see you.
Yes, sir.

151
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:50,435
Mr. Blues, Commander Chamberlain's office
is on the 12th floor. He's expecting you.

152
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,689
"Commander" Chamberlain?

153
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,525
Now, how can I help you, Mr...

154
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,278
Blues. Elwood J. Blues.

155
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:07,410
Would you mind taking your hat
and glasses off in my office, please?

(COMPUTER BEEPING)

157
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,590
Okay, you can put your glasses back on.

158
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:24,886
Now, what exactly is the nature
of your visit here, Mr. Blues?

159
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,638
Well, it's like this. See,

160
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,556
- I used to be in a band...
- Yes.

161
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,601
...called the Blues Brothers.

162
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:32,644
So?

With a partner whose name was Jake Blues.

164
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,398
Go on.

(COMPUTER BEEPING)

00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,115
And you are our long-lost brother.

167
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:52,288
Mr. Blues, I am an only child.

168
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,416
Yeah, but your real father
was like a real father to me, too.

169
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,001
My real father?

170
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,545
Yeah, Curtis.

171
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,798
Have you noticed, Mr. Blues,
that I am an African American?

172
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,259
Yeah, that's okay. So was Curtis.

173
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:11,391
You see, your mother and Curtis
had an extramarital affair,

174
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,018
which produced a little boy, that's you.

My father passed away 14 years ago.

176
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:24,612
He was a full bird colonel
in the United States Air Force.

177
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,532
My mother now lives in Phoenix, Arizona,

178
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:33,454
and a more honorable, sweet-tempered
and goodly woman does not exist.

179
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,457
Look, I'm not making
any moral judgments here,

180
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,335
but one can project
what might have happened in this case.

181
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,922
Your mom, young,
her husband in the military,

182
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,383
away from home much of the time,

183
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:49,554
which may have pushed her to reach out,
stray from the nest.

184
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,638
That's enough.

185
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,142
Just a minute.

186
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,978
Please.

187
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,819
Hi, Ma. It's me, Cab.

188
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,740
Listen, I have a gentleman
in my office here who's telling me

189
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,701
some story about some man named Curtis.

190
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,457
What?

191
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,710
Right.

192
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,427
So, what precisely is it you want from me?

193
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,555
Well, seeing as we're
kind of like stepbrothers,

194
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,724
I thought maybe, you know,
you could help me out.

195
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,059
How could I do that?

196
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,144
I need 500 bucks for this car, see.

197
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,440
And I thought maybe you could, you know,
loan me the money. Or...

198
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,025
Or what?

199
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,778
I'm thinking of putting
the band back together.

200
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,071
Maybe you could join us.

201
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:56,913
I am a commander in the Illinois State Police.
And I enjoy my job.

202
00:15:56,997 --> 00:16:00,875
You waltz in here telling me that I have

203
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,296
a dead, white, criminal brother,
who was in a band,

204
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:11,511
which the last time they played anywhere
were charged with grand larceny,

205
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:17,058
reckless endangerment,
felonious motor vehicle assault,

206
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:21,729
over 700 violations
of the Highway Traffic Act,

207
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:28,528
and damages, both public and private,
in excess of $24 million.

208
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:32,532
And you are asking me
if I want to join this band?

209
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,659
I could show you all the moves.

210
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:38,162

211
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,040
I think you need a hug.

212
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:45,044

I'm selling the place tomorrow.

What would you say if I told you
I was putting the band back together?

I'd say I've got myself a good little business
here and I'm not going back to jail.

They've called ahead by now,

Never mind.

1054
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:12,062

on occasion, to do a polka.

1062
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:36,002
However, Caribbean is a type of music,
I regret to say,

01:34:36,087 --> 01:34:39,339
