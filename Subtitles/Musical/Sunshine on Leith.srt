00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:14,829
My dad, all about the dreams
and the romance.

330
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,963
I had my dreams.
I wanted your Mum,

331
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,170
I wanted kids,
I wanted Hibs to win the league.

332
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,882
- Is that all?
- Two out of three, not bad.

333
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:27,471
Right, I'm off.
See you later.

334
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,180
- Have a good night.
- See you, love.

335
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:33,519
- Don't forget your keys this time.
- Thanks, Dad. I'm not five anymore.

336
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:40,689
Davy's out tonight too.
Got the house to ourselves.

338
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,790
(LIZ) I'm just thinking about
Mum and Dad's anniversary party.

339
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:58,877
You know, 25 years. Makes your head
spin a wee bit, doesn't it?

340
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,586
Yeah.

341
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,132
I've been thinking about
that kind of stuff myself.

342
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,296
You know, the future, 25 years.

343
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:11,097
You can actually see yourself
that far ahead?

344
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,479
Aye.

345
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,891

- Well, all the usual stuff.

346

Working hard, bringing up a family.

347
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:21,487
Going to see Hibs.

You sound like my dad.

350

a priest asked her that question,

and Jean had her answer ready.

541
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,230
After 25 years of marriage,

542
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:53,067

she always has an answer ready.

It wasn't meant to happen.

597
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:32,634
She was going away.
We were just saying goodbye.

598
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,928
You wanted to give her
something to remember you by.

599
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,096
It wasn't like that.

600
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,857
- Did you know?
- Know what?

- About this girl?
- No. No.

00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:44,483
I knew nothing until that arrived.

It's 25 years ago, Jean.

604
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:52,578
We were married, Rab.
We'd made our vows.

605
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,782
What can I say?

606
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,292
What can I do?
Tell me.

607
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:01,788
I want you to get out of my sight.

608
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,548
I don't wanna look at you.

(CHEERING)

612
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:57,302
Ladies and gentlemen, can I have
your attention for a minute, please?

613
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,597
- (LIZ) Oh, my God. What's he doing?
- Thank you.

614
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:06,528
Now, we all know who we're here
to celebrate tonight. Rab and Jean.

615
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:12,947
(LIZ) I don't know
where they've gone.

616
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:19,374
But I'd like to do
some celebrating of my own.

617
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,582
So I need to ask someone a question.

618
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:49,020
Liz, I don't know what
the next 25 years is gonna bring us,

619
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:54,734
but I do know I want
to spend 'em with you.

620
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,383
Liz Henshaw,

621
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:18,220
will you do me the honour
of becoming my wife?

622
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:35,400
I can't.

623
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:40,743
I can't. Ally, I can't.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

624
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:46,794
I'd better go after her.

625
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:53,584
Wee man, I hope you kept
the receipt for that.

626
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,673
It's just a joke.
It's a joke, man.

627
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:08,733
It was just a joke, man.

628
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:13,021
- What did you say to me?
- What?

629
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,734
Who are you?

630
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:26,334
- Calm down. Control yourself.
- I'm not taking that from anybody.

631
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:29,291
- Just leave it. Back off.
- Leave me alone, Davy.

632
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,547
Hey, you, think you're
a big man, do you?

633
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:36,670
Do you want me to kill you?
Do you want me to break you pal?

634
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:39,464
Hit me again
and find out what happens.

635
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:53,945
- Yvonne. Yvonne.
- Let's go.

636
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:56,822
- Who are you?
- You saw what happened.

637
00:46:56,981 --> 00:47:00,110
- Liz. Lizzie.
- You cannae do that, Ally.

638
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:01,448
You should have warned me.

639
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,453
Would that have stopped you
walking out on me?

640
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:06,161
- What was I supposed to do?
- You were supposed to say yes.

641
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:10,374
Come on. Come on.
We're going home. Come on.

642
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,884
I'll put the kettle on.

643
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:17,899
You not going to work?

644
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:22,738
You sick or something?
I could skip school.

645
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,904
We could play the Xbox
or go down to the park if you want.

646
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:30,166
See you later, then, Ally.

647
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,702
See you.

648
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,546
You should have said.
I would have done the shopping.

649
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,256
It's done now.

650
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:47,967
How was work?

651
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,687
You want a cup of tea?

652
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,773
Stop acting as if
nothing's happened.

653
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:05,735
What do you want me to say?

654
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:09,576
I made a mistake.
It was a long time ago.

655
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:11,832
Do you think there's an expiry date
on these things,

656
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:13,993
that after a while
you can't be held responsible?

657
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,755
No, what I'm saying is
we've been through a lot in that time

658
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:21,508
and I think that you should
remember some of that stuff.

659
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,590
That makes it worse,

660
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:26,551
knowing that this thing's
been there all that time,

661
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:29,467
like a wee tumour
poisoning everything.

662
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,235
Why do we stay together?

663
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,610
What do you mean?

664
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:49,744
What if it's just habit?

665
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:52,953
What if it's 'cause we're
too frightened to do anything else?

666
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,583
No, you don't believe that.

667
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:56,870
I don't know anymore.

668
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,462
We'll get through this.

669
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:05,219
I promise you, we will
get through it. We'll sort it.

670
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:08,051
I don't want you to see her again.

671
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:12,597
- You mean Eilidh.
- I don't want to hear her name.

672
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:16,980
I don't want to have to think
about her or her mother.

673
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,475
Even

674
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:22,111
- She's my daughter.
- Don't you dare.

675
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:25,364
This is my family.
She's not part of it.

676
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:28,697
- I will not allow it.
- You want me just to cut her off?

677
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:32,947
You hardly know her.

678
00:50:34,907 --> 00:50:38,332
No. No, I can't do that.
It's not her fault.

679
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,753
Then she's all you'll be left with.

680
00:50:55,553 --> 00:51:00,434
<i>(JEAN SINGS)
I like the smell of perfume</i>

681
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:06,277
<i>I love the taste of booze</i>

682
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:11,862
<i>But I hate my love for you</i>

683
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:17,659
<i>Yeah, I hate my love for you</i>

684
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:23,505
<i>I like Johnny Cash</i>

685
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:29,338
<i>Singing 'A Boy Named Sue'</i>

686
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:35,017
<i>But I hate my love for you</i>

687
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:41,391
<i>Yeah, I hate my love for you</i>

688
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:47,735
<i>Yeah, I hate my love for you</i>

689
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:51,317
<i>Most of all</i>

690
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:22,144
(LIZ) You should have warned me.
You should have said something.

691
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:24,308
I did.

692
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:27,194
All that stuff about the future?
We spoke about it.

693
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:29,230
And I told you that it scared me.

694
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:32,733
I thought it was what you wanted.

695
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,986
Why would you think that?

696
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:39,206
Because you said
it's what everybody wanted.

697
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:41,834
For God's sake, Ally.

698
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:46,664
We have a great time together.
I love being with you.

699
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,832
You're my best pal.

700
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:52,006
That doesn't mean
I'm ready to march down the aisle.

701
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:55,093
You've gotta settle down sometime.

702
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:57,257
I don't want to settle.

703
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:03,098
- You don't wanna settle for me.
- That's not what I meant.

704
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:08,110
So what do you want? What is it
that you want that's so much better?

705
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:14,358
I want the world.

706
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:19,288
Ally, you know,
I want sunshine and skyscrapers.

707
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:24,035
Languages I don't understand.
Music I've never heard before.

708
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:29,790
It sounds like a travel brochure.

709
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:35,091
- Don't laugh at me.
- It hurts, doesn't it?

710
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:43,062
I'll talk to you later, OK?

711
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,682
No.

712
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:51,399
What else have we
got to talk about?

713
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:57,317
You don't mean that.

714
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:01,076
I don't want to be your pal, Liz.

715
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:15,802
Yvonne, we need to talk.

716
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:19,632
- I've got nothing to say to you.
- Then listen.

717
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:22,847
I know it looked bad
and it was bad.

718
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:25,854
- But it's not what you think.
- Leave me alone, Davy.

719
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:27,890
You're jumping to conclusions
and I understand why.

720
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:29,729
But I promise you,
I would never hurt you.

721
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:33,817
<i>(YVONNE SINGS) Thought that I'd be happy
Gonna be so happy</i>

722
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:37,859
<i>Living life alone
and never sharing anything</i>

723
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:41,575
<i>(DAVY SINGS) Thought that I was finished
Thought that I was complete</i>

724
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:45,116
<i>Thought that I was whole
instead of being half of something</i>

725
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:49,037
<i>Thought that I was growing
Growing older, wiser</i>

726
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:52,628
<i>Understanding why this world
held nothing for my spirit</i>

727
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:56,215
<i>Thought that I was destined
Destined to be nothing</i>

728
00:54:56,376 --> 00:55:00,677
<i>Destined to be nothing in this world
and then I met you</i>

729
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,933
<i>I met you</i>

730
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:07,438
<i>I met you</i>

731
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:10,691
<i>I met you</i>

732
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:14,945
<i>I met you</i>

733
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:19,567
- Maybe I just expect too much.
- Maybe you just expect the worst.

734
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:22,577
- You scared me.
- I know. I'm sorry.

735
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:26,786
<i>- Thought the book was written
- Thought the game had ended</i>

736
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:30,624
<i>Thought the song was sung
and I could never sing another</i>

737
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:34,290
<i>Thought I knew this city
Thought I knew all about it</i>

738
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:38,177

Morningside and you were waiting</i>

739
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:41,134

00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,849

00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:56,813

<i>I met you</i>

747
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:25,641
(CHRISTINE) Have you chucked that job
at the call centre, then?

748
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:30,099
Thing is, Ally, you need to have
a think about what you're doing,

749
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:32,014
where you're going.

750
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:35,354
- You can't stay here.
- I'll sort something out.

751
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,645
It's not fair on the wee ones.

752
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,563
- They need their space.
- Chrissie!

753
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:46,574
I'll sort something out.

754
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:49,873
How are you doing, sweetheart?

755
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,960
He doesn't wanna see me any more.

756
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:56,121
He's just hurting, Lizzie.

757
00:56:57,289 --> 00:57:00,418
- It's not your fault.
- I'm the one who turned him down.

758
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:03,508
You've gotta make your own mind
up about what's right for you.

759
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:06,298
Anybody that cares
about you will understand.

760
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,717
But what if...

761
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:13,473
What if what you want's
gonna hurt other people?

762
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:16,643
You cannae go along
with something for their sake.

763
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:19,186
It'll only make things
worse in the end.

764
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:32,290
I found this website.

765
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:37,501
It's a recruitment agency
for health care workers.

766
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:42,510
So I put my details in
and they came back with an offer.

767
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:48,219
- Florida?
- Yeah.

768
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:51,139
And you never said anything.

769
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:55,393
Well, you said
I should make up my own mind.

770
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:03,690
Come here.
That's great, your news, darling.

771
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,567
Thanks, Mum.

772
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:29,514
Yeah, I'm looking forward
to working with you, mate.

773
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:31,095
So long as you're up for a laugh.

774

(DAVY SINGS INDISTINCTLY)

775
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:56,662
Thank you.

776
00:58:56,825 --> 00:58:58,748
- Hiya.
- Your name?

777
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:01,413
- If you make it out to Rab.
- Rab.

778
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,753
No. Robert.

779
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:05,963
- Robert.
- Yeah.

780
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:09,505
- OK.
- Can I ask you a personal question?

781
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:12,390
If you were to fall
out with your partner

782
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:16,304
and you wanted to cook something
really special to win them over,

783
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:19,394
anything in this book
you'd recommend?

784
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:24,232
Are we talking simple but sweet
or seriously impressive?

785
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:27,147
I was hoping for bloody miraculous.

786
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:34,617
Escallops of veal and Marsala.
It's a classic.

787
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:37,741
Veal?

788
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:39,659
Veal.

789
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,081
Veal?

790
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,417
OK.

791
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:52,221
You forgot your book.

792
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:56,268
Are you kidding me?
17 quid?

793
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:59,100
I could fly to Italy for 17 quid.

794
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:03,730
(JEAN) It's like he's been
lying to me all this time.

795
01:00:03,892 --> 01:00:06,270
- (MORAG) Have you thrown him out?
- He's on the couch.

796
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:09,356
Should be in a kennel if you ask me.

797
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:12,197
And Liz is moving halfway
round the world for a new job.

798
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:14,202
- (JANICE) Where's she going?
- Florida.

799
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:18,332
Florida? I'd love to go there.

800
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:20,959
(JEAN) My family's falling apart.

801
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:23,120
I feel like it's my fault.

802
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:26,707
Jean, I'm sorry,
I couldn't help overhearing.

803
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,591
Harry, I'm just being stupid.

804
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:32,095
Aye, you are being stupid if
you think any of this is your fault.

805
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:36,971
Come here. Come on. Come on.

806
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:41,105
- It can happen in any family.
- Come on. Come on.

807
01:00:41,263 --> 01:00:44,437
Mary Queen of Scots,
born 1542, died 1587.

808
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,818
Her third husband
murdered her second husband,

809
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:50,902
her cousin tried her for treason
and her son stole her throne.

810
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:54,944
It's true. If she was alive today,
she'd be on the Jeremy Kyle Show.

811
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:57,408
So you listen to me, Jean Henshaw.

812
01:00:57,571 --> 01:01:00,074
Whatever happened is not your fault.

813
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:04,040
You have done nothing but work yourself
into the ground for your family.

814

(RAB) Bloody veal.
18 quid.

856
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,312
18 quid.

857
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:55,632
Are you all right?

858
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,258
Yeah.

859
01:03:57,417 --> 01:03:59,670
You are gonna have to speak to him,
you know.

860
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:02,305
I know.

(JEAN) I'm scared, Rab.

865
01:04:50,345 --> 01:04:52,939
You're scaring me.

866
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:02,445
At least you're not complaining
about me holding your hand.

867
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:04,735
You never liked that, did you?

868
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,869
Shoved them in your pockets

869
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:09,702
rather than walk down the street
like this.

870
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:15,704
But I rumbled you.
Years ago.

871
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:19,257
When my dad died.

872
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:21,965
You held my hand then.

873
01:05:22,127 --> 01:05:24,129
You held onto it.

874
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:29,134
Tight.

(DOCTOR) The tests suggest the damage
isn't as extensive as we feared.

917
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:13,900
He was lucky.
I've given him a sedative.

918
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:15,364
He'll be out for some time.

919
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:18,029
You should think
about getting some rest yourselves.

920

I'm not leaving him.

921
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:22,496

I'm taking you home to get some rest.

I'm not leaving him here on his own.

I'll stay. You go home.

925
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:31,926
I'll call you when he wakes up.

Are you sure?

01:09:34,629 --> 01:09:36,631

Hiya, Dad.

930
01:10:04,492 --> 01:10:06,415
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

931
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:08,955
How are you feeling today?

932
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:12,217
- Yeah, I'm OK.
- Yeah? Good.

933
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:16,300
Except for Miami.
Passport, visa, suntan lotion.

934
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:17,930
I'm not going, Dad.

935
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:19,716
What, because of me?

936
01:10:20,842 --> 01:10:22,515
No.

937
01:10:22,677 --> 01:10:26,352
How do you think I'm gonna feel if I
thought you didn't go because of me?

938
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:29,066
Come on.

939
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:31,569
I wanna be lying
here thinking of you

940
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:34,698
driving the wrong side of the road,
your Cadillac,

941
01:10:34,856 --> 01:10:36,858
checking your swimming
pool for crocodiles.

942
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:38,150
Alligators, Dad.

943
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:41,237
Whatever.

944
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:45,032
You have to go.

945
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,543
I can't, Dad.

946
01:10:47,702 --> 01:10:50,455
I remember when you were little

947
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:52,919
and we used to go
on those crazy summer holidays.

948
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:56,461
You were the adventurous one.
You were all over the place.

949
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:58,504
More than Davy,
and that's saying something.

950
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:00,969
But abroad, Dad,
it's different.

951
01:11:01,132 --> 01:11:03,134
Hey, you're a Scot.
We have to travel to get work.

952
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:05,804
- Always have and we always will.
- You never moved.

953
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:08,689
Glasgow to Edinburgh,
if you don't mind.

954
01:11:08,848 --> 01:11:10,441
Had a nosebleed at
Waverley Station.

955
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:16,026
I don't want you spending
the rest of your life wondering.

956
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:19,985
You have to go out there.
You have to grab it.

957
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:24,034
OK, look, I'm gonna go.

958
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:26,620
- Let you get some...
- No, no, no. No, no.

959
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:29,827
You have to promise me first.

960
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:34,290
Promise me you'll go.

961
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:41,092
I don't want you just
staying for me.

962
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:43,257
Promise me you'll go.

963
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,142
OK.

964
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:55,937
OK what?
Is that a promise?

965
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:58,856
- OK, I promise.
- Yeah? Big promise?

966
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:01,742
Big grown-up, cross
your heart, hope to die,

967
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:04,245
spit on your mother's
grave kind of promise?

968
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:06,246
Yeah, I promise.

969
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:11,202
Gotta go, OK?

970
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:20,503
Thanks, Dad.

971
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:36,815
So where have you been, man?
Been looking for you.

972
01:12:36,978 --> 01:12:38,446
I wanted space.

973
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:43,568
Look, Ally, I'm sorry. I wish
it could have worked out better.

974
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:46,412
I hear she's going away.

975
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:51,243
Makes sense, I suppose.

976
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:55,459
I know it feels like
the end of the world, but it's not.

977
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:57,419
Things move on. You'll get over it.

978
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:05,924
So Davy's got it all sussed, has he?

979
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:08,092
Davy and Yvonne.

980
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:10,811
What happens when
you make a mistake?

981
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:13,974
Maybe you say the wrong thing,
ask the wrong question.

982
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:17,189
You wait and see
how quickly she dumps you then.

983
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:18,443
I'm just trying to help.

984
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:20,276
I don't remember asking
for your help.

985
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:23,984
So what are you gonna do?

986
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:26,744
Well, there's nothing
for me here now, so...

987
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:30,203
- Where are you gonna go?
- Where do you think I'm going?

988
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:32,207
I've joined up again.

989
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:36,121
Ally, you know what it's like out there.
You know what can happen.

990
01:13:36,287 --> 01:13:38,836
- It's not that bad.
- We nearly died, Ally. It's crazy.

991
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:41,376
So it's not what
we're supposed to be doing?

992
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:44,421
Looking for some sort of adventure,
something new, something else?

993
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:46,806
- Not settling for what we've got?
- What about Ronnie?

994
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:48,386
Think he'd settle for what he's got?

995
01:13:48,549 --> 01:13:50,176
- Ronnie was unlucky.
- You need to think about this.

996
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:51,390
- I have.
- Think again.

997
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:55,273
- Stop telling me what to do.
- Why would you want to go back?

998
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:57,433
Because they wanted me!

999
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:07,410
- Ally, I'm begging You-
- Davy.

1000
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:09,570
I get it.

1001
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:12,990
You need to let me do this.

1002
01:14:21,666 --> 01:14:23,043
Keep your head down.

1003
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:29,557
Don't do anything stupid.
D'you hear?

1004
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,469
Hey.

1005
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:36,480
I'll be fine.

1006
01:14:46,232 --> 01:14:48,200
I'll be fine.

1007
01:14:49,694 --> 01:14:52,868
Hi, Rab. Jean dropped this off
earlier for you when you were asleep.

1008
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:54,282
I thought I'd pop it in.

1009
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:26,530
(YVONNE) Where's that?

1010
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:29,283
That's Ullapool, I think.
Have you been up there?

1011
01:15:29,442 --> 01:15:32,742
No, I've been meaning to.
It looks so beautiful.

1012
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:36,578
(YVONNE) Lizzie.

1013
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:44,332

- Yeah.

1018
01:16:14,028 --> 01:16:16,030
Well, it's a teaching hospital,

1019
01:16:16,197 --> 01:16:18,666
so I could choose a specialism

1020
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:21,543
and do a masters if I want.

1021
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:24,956
Well, you'd better.
What will you go for?

1022
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:30,011
- Nurse practitioner?
- That's nearly a doctor, isn't it?

1023
01:16:31,462 --> 01:16:32,839

do you want to make this work?

Do you think I'd be
