That's near Denver.

185
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,629
I see.
Been here long?

186
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,832
No. Just a few weeks.

187
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,767
Where have you been working?

188
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:09,769
The Benson public library.

189
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,170
Singing?

190
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,440
No. I sang
in the church
on Sunday.

191
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:17,109
Oh, so you sang
in the church choir?

192
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,377
Yes.

193
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,546
You see, it was
my father's old church.

194
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:23,115
And your father is a preacher?

195
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:26,719
Yes. He was.

196
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,389
Was? Oh. He got
onto himself, huh?

197
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,960
He died four years ago.

198
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,728
I get it--

199
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:39,332
the orphan child
of a country parson.

200
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,234
Well, after all, Mr. Norton,

201
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,136
there are such men
as country Parsons.

202
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:45,938
Sometimes they do
have daughters.

203
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,307
Well, now, that sort of
puts me in my place,

204
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:49,708
don't it?

205
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,610
Well, who brought you
to San Francisco?

206
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:54,313
No one. My mother
helped me get here.

207
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,548
Oh, I see.

208
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,751
You don't believe me, do you?

209
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:01,087
Why, sure, sure.
I believe you.

210
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:04,056
You're all right, Mary.

211
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,624
Tomorrow we're going to get rid

212
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,126
of those Benson glad rags

213
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:09,028
and dig you up
some swell, new scenery.

214
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,063
You got all the makings, kid.

215
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,266
Why, you're going to do great.

216
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:17,070
What's the matter?

217
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,406
Where are you going?

218
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,774
I don't know.

219
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:23,209
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

220
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,743
You don't have to
stall me, honey.

221
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,145
Well, you know,

222
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:28,147
I wrote that old spiel
you just pulled--

223
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:29,748
parson father,
sacrificing mother--

224
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,317
the whole thing years ago.

225
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:33,920
I guess you got
some John on the string.

226
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:35,521
Is that it?

227
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:37,656
Please let me go.

228
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:39,292
I see.

229
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:44,263
Well, how much
is the railroad fare

230
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,899
here from Benson?

231
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,768
I paid $16.80.

232
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,203
Tomorrow morning, I'll have babe

233
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,272
give you an advance
in salary--$20.

234
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,207
You can send for
that mug you're stuck on.

235
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,843
You know, I admire a woman

236
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:58,444
you can trust out of town.

237
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:02,281
Getting late.
You can bunk here,
if you want to.

238
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,917
Try the sofa.

239
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:02,976
Good night, sucker.

240
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:22,561
Hey, Blackie,

241
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:24,163
the professor's
waiting for
that new girl

242
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:25,797
to show up for rehearsal.

243
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:29,368
She hasn't shown up.

244
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,669
No good, huh?

245
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,571
I'll say she's good.
Her father was a preacher.

246
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,640
Are you falling for
that old preacher
gag?

247
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,542
Maybe her father wasa preacher.

248
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,745
Oh, so you
still believe
in Santa clause?

249
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,747
Trouble with you is you don't
believe in anything.

250
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:42,982
Oh, that's where I'm smart.

251
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,650
Did you say smart?

252
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,319
That's what I said.

253
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,926
I'm a sucker if I'll
ever learn anything.

254
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:55,627
For 20 years that mug
has mauled me around

255
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:56,929
making a chump out of me,

256
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,931
and I always come back for more.

257
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:00,599
He got to bed
earlier than you
last night.

258
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,968
Come on.
Get up.

259
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:03,702
I'm not going to move
from this spot

260
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,304
till you're out of the building.

261
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:06,705
Ha ha ha!

262
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,975
All right, kid.
So long, mug.

263
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:10,876
Hey, that guy packs
an awful wallop,

264
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:12,544
don't he?

265
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:13,946
Yeah.

266
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:15,347
Is he gone?

267
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,116
Uh-huh.
Look at the parade.

268
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:18,817
Hello, Blackie.
Hello, mat.

269
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:21,087
Hello, boys.

270
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,821
Blackie, would you like to...

271
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:24,223
Yeah. Thanks.

272
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:25,857
Someone just
showed me to a seat.

273
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,961
Mat, get me my robe, will you?

274
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:30,696
Blackie, we've looked you up

275
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:32,064
to complain about that fire

276
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:33,565
last night on dupont street.

277
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,167
Complain? I thought
it was perfect.

278
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,835
What do you boys want
in the way of a fire?

279
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:38,570
You talk better at the meeting--

280
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:40,039
sitting down.

281
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,707
Jim Sullivan's kids got trapped

282
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,342
in that fire last night.

283
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:45,277
They had to jump for it.

284
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,945
Yeah. I know.
I saw.

285
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,314
They pulled it off

286
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:49,982
like circus performers.

287
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,517
Mr. Norton,
you ain't got no kids.

288
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:54,520
I got plenty kids--
Luigi, Pedro, Maria,

289
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:55,921
and little Tony,

290
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:58,024
and maybe more when I get home.

291
00:15:58,025 --> 00:15:59,691
[Man]
Don't go home.

292
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,093
Well, look, boys,

293
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:02,694
put me down for 100 bucks

294
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,030
for Jim and the kids.

295
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:05,397
That isn't what
we came for,
Blackie.

296
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:09,401
We want to run you
for supervisor.

297
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:10,902
What?

298
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,338
That's right, Blackie.

299
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,706
The only way
to get decent
fire regulations

300
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,108
on the coast is to force them

301
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,476
through the board
of supervisors.

302
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,145
You're the only man on the coast

303
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:20,546
with the, uh...

304
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:21,547
Authority...

305
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:23,015
To do it.

306
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:25,751
There's nobody else
crazy enough--

307
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:27,053
ixnay.
Shut up!

308
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:28,854
Yeah, and maybe I'm not either.

309
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:30,156
I think it's a great idea.

310
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,857
Well, hello, father.

311
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:33,159
Why, certainly.
It's dynamite.

312
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,660
Supervisor Norton--
you'll get the joint

313
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,228
a million dollars'
worth of publicity.

314
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:37,829
Well, what do you say?

315
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,298
Where will you get the dough?

316
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:40,832
We'll back you, Blackie.

317
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,234
Up to the limit.

318
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:43,835
Father Mullin, you speak to him.

319
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,171
You like a fight,
Blackie. Go on.

320
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:47,005
Have you all gone crazy?

321
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,407
I can't do anything with him.

322
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:49,741
I've been trying for 20 years.

323
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,710
Maybe you fellas can.
So long. Good luck.

324
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,179
Bye, Tim.

325
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,047
Well, Blackie, what about it?

326
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:56,848
Come on over to the bar.

327
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,184
Let's have a drink.

328
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:59,885
Can you
imagine what
that Nob Hill guy

329
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:01,521
is going to say--

330
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,861
there won't be any competition.

331
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,297
Mr. Norton, I tell you what.

332
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:13,432
The next boy
my Maria give to me,

333
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:16,368
I name him Blackie
after you. Ha ha ha!

334
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,371
Oh, name the next
half-dozen after him.

335
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,241
You think it won't be a battle?

336
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:23,575
He'll have all Nob Hill

337
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,043
flooding around him like bees.

338
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,148
I think you fellas
have all gone crazy.

339
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,883
Oh, Mr. Norton.

340
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,319
Yes? What is it?

341
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,554
May I have that job?

342
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,822
Didn't I say so?

343
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:38,257
Yes.

344
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:40,259
How many times do you
want me to say it?

345
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,860
Come on around here.

346
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,295
Come around here.

347
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:44,963
[Piano playing]

348
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:47,366
What will you have, boys?

349
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:49,435
Make mine a little whiskey.

350
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:51,937
Whiskey.
That's good.

351
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:53,972
* open your golden gate *

352
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:57,309
* you let no stranger wait *

353
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,412
* outside your door... *

354
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,481
what will you
have to drink, mat?

355
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:05,384
[Mary]
* San Francisco... *

356
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:06,985
a little chloroform.

357
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:09,188
Water for me.

358
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:12,158
Here's looking at you, Blackie.

359
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:14,260
Gentlemen.
Thank you.

360
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:17,329
* more *

361
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,531
* other places only *

362
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,600
* make me love you best... *

363
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,735
ain't she singing
kind of slow, Blackie?

364
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:26,004
Yeah.

365
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:28,140
Hope you ain't gone
and signed her up.

366
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:30,809
Why? So you
can grab her
for your joint?

367
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,678
* west... *

368
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:34,280
do you think I'm running
a funeral parlor?

369
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:35,947
But, Blackie,
with a voice
like hers,

370
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,383
it ain't so easy to--

371
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:39,151
go on. Go on.
Get out.

372
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:40,586
Give it this.

373
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:42,154
[Plays San Francisco rapidly]

374
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:43,689
Put something into it.

375
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,224
That's what
it's about--
San Francisco.

376
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:47,393
But I can't
sing like that,
Mr. Norton.

377
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:48,827
That's the way
you're going
to sing,

378
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:51,130
or you're not
going to sing it
for Blackie.

379
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:58,103
Hey, mat...

380
00:18:58,104 --> 00:18:59,705
Go tell babe
to dig up a contract.

381
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,173
A contract?

382
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:02,508
Yeah. I'd better
sign that girl up

383
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:04,042
before I change my mind.

384
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:07,112
Changeyour mind?
You've lost it.

385
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:08,347
I'd like to see Burley's face

386
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:09,581
when he hears about it.

00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,341
good evening, Mr. Burley.

409
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:11,677
Show Mr. Burley
and signor baldini
to a box.

410
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,979
Just a minute.
Is Blackie Norton around?

411
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,381
Yeah.

412
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,215
Tell him I'd like to see him.

413
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,784
Come with me.

Hello, Blackie.

421
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:34,032
Oh, hello, Burley.

422
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,501
Mr. Norton, signor baldini.

423
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:37,403
[Baldini]
Very pleased
to meet you.

424
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:39,170
Gentlemen,
what'll you have
to drink?

425
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,672
Maestro, my name is Harrison.

426
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,274
I played under your direction

427
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:44,009
one night in Dresden.

428
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,444
Really?

429
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:47,178
I haven't been
in Dresden
in 20 years.

430
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,580
Yes. That's right.

431
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,682
Oh, I'm happy--
very happy--
to see you again.

432
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:51,518
Thank you.

433
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:53,151
Me, I'm nothing, but, maestro,

434
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:54,553
we have down here a voice--

435
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:57,289
a voice that would
delight your soul,

436
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,690
maestro.

437
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:00,426
Professor, how about
going on with the show?

438
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:01,960
Yes. Yes. Excuse me, Mr. Norton.

439
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:03,362
If you could only hear it

440
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:05,297
in something good.

441
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:07,299
[Blackie] Professor!

442
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,667
We're trying to
give a show tonight.

443
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:10,302
Yes. Yes. Excuse me, Mr. Norton.

444
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:11,837
Maestro, this voice--

445
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:13,405
I would like
to have you
hear it.

446
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:14,940
Well, how about it?

447
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,042
Yes. Yes.
I'm going.

448
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:18,410
I'm going.

449
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:20,178
Well, I guess you know

450
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:22,047
why I'm down here.

451
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,449
Nope.

452
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,916
I heard this afternoon

453
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:26,518
you're going to run
for supervisor.

454
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:27,919
Yeah.
That's right.

455
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,655
I wouldn't do it,
if I were you,
Norton.

456
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:31,189
Why not?

457
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,724
I don't think you'll like it.

458
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:33,725
I'll love it.

459
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:35,327
Have you ever
stopped to consider--

460
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:37,663
just a minute, Burley.

461
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,064
Waiter.

462
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:40,466
Yes, sir?

463
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,267
Tell babe to go backstage

464
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:43,902
and see what's the matter.

465
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:45,537

466
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:47,539
Jack. Jack,
that girl got
a voice.

467
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,942
She had some training, too.

468
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:52,411
Hey, boss.

469
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:54,012

* not a thought, not a care *

00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,359
* with a heart debonair *

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,930
* I am free as the sea *

481
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:49,468
* like the lark who at dawn
bid the darkness be gone *

482
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:53,304
* so I sing merrily *

* with a laugh and a dance,
my design--to entrance *

484

and the words that I sing *

488
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:19,931
[baldini] Bravo. Bravo.

489
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:20,932
Brava. Brava.

490
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:22,167
How long has
that girl been
down here?

491
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:23,502
Just started.

492
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:24,870
What's her name?

493
00:23:24,871 --> 00:23:26,304
Mary Blake.

494
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:27,839
What did I tell you, maestro?

495
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,175
Will you get back to that piano?

496
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:31,510
Yes. I'm going,

497
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:33,244
and I don't care if you fire me.

498
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,647
At least I've had
the opportunity
to help a girl.

499
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:37,483
Well, who said I was firing you?

500
00:23:37,484 --> 00:23:38,850
Now, come on.
Get going.

501
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:41,386
Yes. Thank you,
Mr. Norton.
Thank you.

502
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:42,921
I'd like to meet that girl.

503
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,322
Oh, waiter.

504
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:45,724
[Waiter]
Yes, Mr. Burley?

505
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:47,325
See if miss Blake will meet

506
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:48,794
a respectful admirer.

507
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:50,395
I haven't
had her working
at the boxers yet.

508
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:52,030
I'm glad of that.

509
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:53,465
One never knows

510
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:54,900
where one's going to
find talent.

511
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:57,736
No. No.
One never does,
does one?

512
00:23:57,737 --> 00:24:00,171
Yes, and I quote from Plautus.

513
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:03,341
[Speaking Latin]

514
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:05,076
Yeah. You took the words

515
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:06,578
right out of my mouth.

516
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,214
Mr. Burley?

517
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:10,616
It's very gracious of you

518
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:11,850
to allow us
this privilege,
miss Blake.

519
00:24:11,851 --> 00:24:13,251
Thank you.

520
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:14,753
May I present signor baldini?

521
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:16,488
How do you do, signor?

522
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:18,123
Good evening, my dear.

523
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:19,457
Won't you sit down?

524
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,326
Waiter, a bottle
of cordon Rouge '94.

525
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:22,728
You bet, sir.

526
00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:24,429
And the usual for you?

527
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,431
Yes.
A little water.

528
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:28,366
Hearing a voice like yours

529
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,035
in the variety theater

530
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:32,237
has been for me
a great experience.

531
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:33,639
Thank you, signor,

532
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,040
but you might have heard me

533
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,642
under more favorable
circumstances.

534
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:39,244
I sat in
the outer office
of the tivoli

535
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:41,379
for six days once.

536
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,448
So you want to sing in opera?

537
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:45,383
That's why I came
to San Francisco.

538
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:46,918
You have the training, too?

539
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,754
Yes, with the best
teacher in Denver.

540
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:50,722
I led the Bach choral society,

541
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:52,791
I won first prize
at the Schubert festival,

542
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:54,926
and I've done
violetta, Marguerite,

543
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:57,663
puccini's Mimi, and Tosca.

544
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:59,264
I love Puccini.

545
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:00,599
Oh, Puccini.

546
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,033
[Speaking Italian]

547
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:04,002
Did you ever hear
of Puccini, Norton?

548
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,537
Yeah. Didn't he run a joint

549
00:25:05,538 --> 00:25:07,138
down on dupont street?

550
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:09,074
Ha ha ha!

551
00:25:09,075 --> 00:25:10,842
Well, there's no law
against an opera singer

552
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,044
being slender and young
and beautiful.

553
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:14,145
What do you think

554
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:16,181
about giving miss Blake
an audition?

555
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:17,616
Yes, by all means.

556
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:19,517
Say, that's darn sweet
of you, Burley--

557
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,919
to take an interest
in the little lady,

558
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,588
and you, too, signor,

559
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:24,122
but she's under
a two-year contract.

560
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:25,557
To whom?

561
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:27,225
To me.

562
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:28,459
Two years?

563
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,696
Yes, but I'll have
her notify you
when it runs out.

564
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:32,130
Surely you wouldn't let that

565
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:34,566
stand in her way
to sing in
the tivoli.

566
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:36,602
Why? She's doing all right here.

567
00:25:36,603 --> 00:25:38,369
I'm sorry, miss Blake.

568
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,972
Mr. Norton's quite right.

569
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:43,709
After all, paradise is
just as important to him

570
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,410
as the tivoli is to you.

571
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:46,812
What would happen to the tivoli

572
00:25:46,813 --> 00:25:48,413
if its artists were
allowed to walk out

573
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:49,815
anytime they pleased?

574
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:52,718
You are a very
loyal girl, miss Blake.

575
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:54,887
No. I'm very grateful
to Mr. Norton.

576
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,360
Well...

577
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:03,829
Well, I'll be going.

578
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,430
We don't have much time
between numbers.

579
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:06,765
Thank you, signor.

580
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:08,466
This has been the happiest night

581
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:10,368
of my life.

582
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:11,737
Bye.

583
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:13,471
I haven't given up yet

584
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:14,940
about the tivoli.

585
00:26:14,941 --> 00:26:16,642
You don't know Mr. Norton.

586
00:26:16,643 --> 00:26:18,644
You don't know me.

587
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:20,245
Good-bye.

588
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:21,546
Good-bye.

589
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:24,817
Just a minute.
I want to see you.

590
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:29,354
Who told you to sing
that highbrow number?

591
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:30,822
No one.

592
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:32,457
Well, now that you've
made your impression,

593
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:33,825
don't do it again.

594
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:35,360
Blackie doesn't like it.

595
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:36,762
Friend of mine runs a joint

596
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:38,163
around on kearney street.

597
00:26:38,164 --> 00:26:39,798
I want you to hurry around there

598
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:41,532
and tear up
a little number for him.

599
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,134
All right.
Where is it?

600
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:45,136
St. Anne's mission--
just around the corner.

601
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:46,504
St. Anne's?

602
00:26:46,505 --> 00:26:48,006
Yes. Ask for father Mullin.

603
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:50,041
You know
the hokey-pokey
they sing there.

604
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:52,243
You've got a number
to do back here
at 10:30.

605
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:53,812
We won't need that now.

606
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:56,181
Burley, you don't
want me to run
for supervisor?

607
00:26:56,182 --> 00:26:57,649
You know as well as I

608
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,917
it's not practical
to rebuild the coast.

609
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:00,518
The coast is picturesque.

610
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,253
People come down here slumming.

611
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:03,655
They don't want to feel

612
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:05,156
like they're in a spotless town.

613
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:06,792
But that isn't your real reason.

614
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:08,526
The main one is
you don't want to
spend your dough

615
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:10,161
to make your property
down here safe.

616
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:11,897
If I did what you wanted me to,

617
00:27:11,898 --> 00:27:13,631
it would be
a calamity
for the coast.

618
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,033
The Burley estate has to make

619
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:16,668
certain interest
on its investment.

620
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:18,536
I'd have to raise rents.

621
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:19,971
You boys couldn't live.

622
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:22,073
You'd have to
charge 10 cents
for a glass of beer.

623
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:23,641
I don't get him, Mr. baldini.

624
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,043
He tosses a fortune every year

625
00:27:25,044 --> 00:27:26,878
to the tivoli opera house.

626
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:28,479
But that's not business.
That's for San Francisco.

627
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,948
The coast is San Francisco, too.

628
00:27:29,949 --> 00:27:31,482
That's why I wouldn't change it.

629
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,318
These little mugs down here

630
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,820
are my people.

631
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:36,254
I'll see
that they get
a square deal,

632
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:37,956
so I'm not pulling
out of this fight.

633
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:40,425
I don't want
to fight you, Norton,

634
00:27:40,426 --> 00:27:41,960
but you're asking for it.

635
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:43,930
I'm not ducking anything.

636
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:46,765
Good night.

637
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:48,433
Good night.

638
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:50,036
Good night.

639
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,571
You're wanted
on the phone, boss.

640
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:55,441
O.K.

641
00:27:57,443 --> 00:27:59,177
Hello.

642
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,645
Oh, hello, Tim.

643
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:03,048
Why don't you come on over?

644
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:04,215
What for?

645
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:06,384
The organ recital
and to hear
the young lady.

646
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:07,753
She'll be coming back here

647
00:28:07,754 --> 00:28:09,120
to sing the things I like.

648
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:11,990
All right. Have it your own way.

649
00:28:11,991 --> 00:28:14,025
I was just sort of hoping

650
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,061
you'd make my evening complete.

651
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:18,296
If I had you here now,
I'd hug you,

652
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:20,531
and then I'd knock
your block off.

653
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,000
Ha ha ha!

654
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:24,202
I don't have to
tell you how I feel
about the organ.

655
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,470
Ah, forget it.

656
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:27,807
All right, Blackie.
Good-bye.

657
00:28:31,944 --> 00:28:34,881

658

[Mary]
* last night I lay
a-sleeping *

659
00:28:47,126 --> 00:28:52,597
* there came a dream so fair *

660
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:57,735
* I stood in old Jerusalem *

661
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:03,909
* beside the temple there *

662
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:08,814
* I heard the children singing *

663
00:29:08,815 --> 00:29:14,552
* and ever on, they sang *

664
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:19,724
* before the voice of angels *

665
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:25,931
* from heaven in answer rang *

666
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:32,570
* Jerusalem, Jerusalem *

00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:37,708

* hosanna in the highest *

671

* hosanna forevermore **

672
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:19,084
oh, father, that was
simply marvelous.

673
00:30:19,085 --> 00:30:21,119
And that little boy.
Wasn't he sweet?

674
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,954
Can you get home all right?

675
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:24,455
Yes, thank you.

676
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:25,756
Good night.

677
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:26,791
Hey, Mike.

678
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:27,825
Yes, father?

679
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,160
Got any money?

680
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,396
Sure, father.
Me wife's got a job.

681
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:33,932
Good night.
Good night. Good night.

682
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:35,366
Good night, father Mullin.

683
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:38,870
It was very nice
of you to leave work
and rescue us.

684
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:40,405
It made me feel good being here.

685
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:42,941
You're not the girl
whose father was
a preacher, are you?

686
00:30:42,942 --> 00:30:44,509
Well, yes.
How did you know?

687
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,112
Blackie told me.
I'd like to talk to you.

688
00:30:47,113 --> 00:30:48,880
But I'm afraid I'll be late.

689
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:50,715
That's O.K. I'll fix it
with Blackie.

690
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:52,951
Will you join me
in a cup of coffee?

691
00:30:52,952 --> 00:30:54,752
Yes. I'd like to.
Thank you.

692
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:56,454
I make good coffee.

693
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:59,857
How are you making out
at the paradise?

694
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,993
Well, I've only just started.

695
00:31:01,994 --> 00:31:03,761
I see. Sit down there,
won't you?

696
00:31:03,762 --> 00:31:05,030
Thank you.

697
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:07,032
How do you like Blackie?

698
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:08,366
I'm afraid of him.

699
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:11,136
Ah. And he's someone
to be afraid of.

700
00:31:11,137 --> 00:31:12,770
He's as unscrupulous with women

701
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:14,772
as he is ruthless with men.

702
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:17,042
But why did he
send me down here?

703
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:18,643
I don't understand him.

704
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:19,545
You don't, huh?

705
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:20,611
No.

706
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,047
Ha ha ha!

707
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:24,082
What's the matter?

708
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,117
You probably understand Blackie

709
00:31:26,118 --> 00:31:29,888
a whole lot better
than he understands you.

710
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:34,292
You see, I don't think
Blackie ever knew

711
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:36,461
your type of woman before.

712
00:31:36,462 --> 00:31:38,930
But there's nothing
to be afraid of,

713
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:40,631
unless you're afraid
of yourself.

714
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,301
Are you?

715
00:31:43,802 --> 00:31:45,170
No.

716
00:31:45,171 --> 00:31:47,405
No, I guess I'm a little dazed.

717
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:50,208
You see, I've been
in San Francisco
for over six weeks,

718
00:31:50,209 --> 00:31:51,909
and nothing ever happened,

719
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,212
and then, within
the last 24 hours,

720
00:31:54,213 --> 00:31:56,214
the whole world's
gone Topsy-turvy.

721
00:31:56,215 --> 00:31:58,217
Makes me feel like running home.

722
00:31:58,985 --> 00:32:00,952
Well, if you are afraid,

723
00:32:00,953 --> 00:32:02,687
you'd better run home.

724
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:04,755
How about it?

725
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,657
I'm going to stay.

726
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:09,060
That's right.

727
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:11,296
You're in probably
the wickedest,
most corrupt,

728
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:13,164
most godless city in America.

729
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:14,565
Sometimes it frightens me.

730
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:16,634
I wonder what the end
is going to be.

731
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:19,437
But nothing can
harm you if you
don't allow it to,

732
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,139
because nothing in the world,

733
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,508
no one in the world, is all bad.

734
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:25,643
Do you know who gave the chapel

735
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:27,445
that organ we've been
dedicating tonight?

736
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,514
The most godless, scoffing,

737
00:32:29,515 --> 00:32:32,450
and unbelieving soul
in all San Francisco--

738
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,185
Blackie Norton.

739
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:36,454
Blackie heard
one night that I was
saving for an organ.

740
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,956
The very next morning,
men arrived to plan
the installation.

741
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,391
Cost him $4,000.

742
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:43,161
If that monkey
would save his money
for a few weeks,

743
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:44,529
he'd be rich.

744
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,431
He's a tremendous force,
Blackie is.

745
00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:50,201
If he were only
a force for good
instead of evil.

746
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:53,271
I've tried to do
something with him
for years,

747
00:32:53,272 --> 00:32:55,306
but I haven't had any luck.

748
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,609
Maybe I'm not the right one.

749
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:01,146
You've known each
other a long time,
haven't you?

750
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:04,049
Oh, sure, sure.
Blackie and I
were kids together.

751
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:06,017
Born and brought up
on the coast.

752
00:33:06,018 --> 00:33:07,518
We used to sell newspapers

753
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,420
in the joints
along pacific street.

754
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:11,756
Blackie was
the leader of
the neighborhood kids,

755
00:33:11,757 --> 00:33:13,324
and I was his pal.

756
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:16,994
Our families used to
try to get us to go
to mass on Sunday,

757
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,563
but we generally ducked.

758
00:33:18,564 --> 00:33:20,998
That reminds me,
that Rooney kid
ducked mass.

759
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,301
And then I got
so I wanted to go.

760
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:25,436
Blackie thought I was crazy.

761
00:33:25,437 --> 00:33:28,106
And when I decided
I was going to study
for the priesthood,

762
00:33:28,107 --> 00:33:29,574
I wanted to talk to Blackie.

763
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:31,442
I wanted to see
if I couldn't get him
to understand,

764
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:33,544
to feel a little bit as I felt,

765
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:36,181
but he just said, "well,
good luck, sucker,"

766
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:37,548
and that was all.

767
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:39,317
We never were able
to have that talk.

768
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:41,052
I came back from college
and found Blackie

769
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:44,055
deeper than ever
in the life of the coast.

770
00:33:44,056 --> 00:33:45,623
But he has a code.

771
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:48,159
He's always had,
ever since
we were kids.

772
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,994
He never lied, he never cheated,

773
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:54,332
and he never
took an underhanded
advantage of anyone.

774
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:58,804
There's a picture
of us together
when we were kids.

775
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,207
Hmm.

776
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:04,275
Oh, don't let him
know I told you
about the organ.

777
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:05,810
He'd never forgive me.

778
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:08,213
Oh, no. Oh, no, I won't.

779
00:34:08,214 --> 00:34:10,348
He's that way, Blackie is.

780
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:12,250
Ashamed of his good deeds

781
00:34:12,251 --> 00:34:15,052
as other people
are ashamed of their sins.

782
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,654
And nobody will ever
make me believe

783
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:19,424
there isn't
more good than bad
in Blackie Norton.

introducing the president

of the ladies

805
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:34,765

807
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:42,173
Girls and boys,
I just want to tell you

808
00:35:42,174 --> 00:35:43,508
that the ladies of the coast

809
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:46,277
wish to go on record
as endorsing Blackie Norton

810
00:35:46,278 --> 00:35:48,280
right up to the limit!

811
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:58,055
Ladies and gentlemen, I will now
introduce that great guy,

812
00:35:58,056 --> 00:35:59,690
our candidate.

813
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:03,261

00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:19,377
Thanks. I'm no politician.

818
00:36:19,378 --> 00:36:23,314
I didn't ask for this,
but now that I'm in it,

819
00:36:23,315 --> 00:36:26,517
I won't stop until I get
some decent fire laws

820
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,986
for our people
down on the coast.

[Man]
Wait a minute, Norton.

823
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:36,594
What I want to know is,
what construction company

824
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:38,929
is paying you
for trying to
rebuild the coast?

825
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:42,099
Yeah. That's right.
How about it, Blackie?

826
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,768
Why are you going into politics?

827
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:45,035
Tell us, Norton.

828
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,239
Here's the answer you can take
to your boss Jack Burley.

829
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,708
Oh! Oh!

830
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:57,014
We've tried long enough
to get a square deal

831
00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:59,817
from those potbellied
landowners up on Nob Hill.

832
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:02,687
Now we're going to
go after it on our own!

833
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:04,389
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

834
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,924
Tommy, come here.

835

This is Jim Sullivan's kid.

836
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:11,929
Last new year's Eve,
he and his sister

837
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:15,734
had to jump three floors
out of a burning building.

838
00:37:17,803 --> 00:37:20,338
Are we going to go on
letting these Nob Hill stiffs

839
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:23,007
make fire dancers
out of our women and kids?

840
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:25,042
Not if I can help it!

841
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:26,712
Yeah! Yeah!

842
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:33,285
And now, free beer on me!

843
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:39,557
You were swell!
I'm so proud
of you, I--

844
00:37:39,558 --> 00:37:42,360
thanks. Run along
and get yourself
some beer.

Aren't we going to be together?

846
00:37:43,729 --> 00:37:45,930
I told you I'd be busy
when I brought you here.

847
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:46,964
Well, I'll wait for you.

848
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:49,935
You get yourself
a drink. That's a girl.

do me a favor?

00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:56,040
Sure.

851
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:58,676
Go and get Trixie
and take her back
to town.

852
00:37:58,677 --> 00:37:59,810
To town?

853
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:01,679
Yeah. She's
hanging around

00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,314
Then what about miss Blake?

00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:04,415
Oh. How do you do?

856
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:05,450
How do you do?

857
00:38:05,451 --> 00:38:06,751
I brought her out here.

858
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:08,887
I'll see that she
gets home all right.

860
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:22,333
That's awful pretty.
Know the name of it?

00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:24,335
Would you?

00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:25,837

Glad you came?

00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:05,376
Yes.

00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:06,844
What's the matter?

866
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,113
Nothing.

00:39:11,116 --> 00:39:13,584
Do you mind
going a little
faster, please?

868
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:15,252
I promised father Mullin

869
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:17,221
I'd stop by if I had time.

870
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:18,923
Yeah, sure.

871
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:22,226
Go on. Get up there!

872
00:39:22,227 --> 00:39:25,262
You and Tim seem
to be hitting it off
pretty well.

00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:26,263
Oh, yes.

874
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:27,532
What do you talk about?

00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:29,634
Lots of things.
His work, mostly.

876
00:39:29,635 --> 00:39:30,868
Oh, yeah, that's right.

877
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,770
You believe in that hocus-pocus.

878
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:34,104
Yes.

879
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:35,540
Even if I hadn't believed,

880
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:37,775
the faith of a man
like father Mullin
would make me.

881
00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:39,076
Yeah, that's the trouble.

882
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:40,711
It gets hold of people
that are all right

883
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:42,246
and makes monkeys out of them.

884
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:43,648
It lost me Tim Mullin.

885
00:39:43,649 --> 00:39:45,550
He'd have made
the greatest gambler
on the coast.

886
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:47,117
I wanted to hang on to him.

887
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:49,987
He loves you more
than anyone else
in the world.

888
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:52,256
Yeah? Well, he
blew me for a lot
of plaster saints.

889
00:39:52,257 --> 00:39:55,560
You know, I don't
go for that sucker
competition, Mary.

Blackie's got to be
number-one boy.

891
00:39:57,763 --> 00:39:59,497
But it isn't competition.

892
00:39:59,498 --> 00:40:01,766
I think people who
believe in something

893
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:03,834
can love each other more.

894
00:40:03,835 --> 00:40:05,636
Well, honey, if that's
what you believe,

895
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:07,304
it's all right with me.

896
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:09,140
I don't hold it against you.

897
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:18,415
Say, who's that mug
you're stuck on?

898
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,184
No one.

899
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:21,418
Well, didn't there used to be?

900
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,053
No.

901
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:24,354
Never?

902
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:25,823
Never, no.

903
00:40:25,824 --> 00:40:27,926
Whoa.

904
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,928
Are you kidding?

905
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,597
No.

906
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:34,765
Well, I'm a sucker if I ever

907
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,901
knew a girl like you before.

908
00:40:36,902 --> 00:40:39,605
Come on. Get along there, Dan.

909
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,341
You must have had to do
some fast footwork

910
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:48,145
to side-step those dudes
out there in Benson,
Colorado, huh?

911
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:50,582
It wasn't
so difficult,
Mr. Norton.

912
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,084
Blackie.

913
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:56,420
Blackie.

914
00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:58,089
That's better.

915
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:14,371
* he holds her in his arms *

916
00:41:14,372 --> 00:41:19,276
* would you? Would you? *

917
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:23,514
* he tells her of her charms *

918
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:28,418
* would you? Would you? *

919
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:32,422
* they met as you and I *

920
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:38,362
* and they were only friends *

921
00:41:38,363 --> 00:41:44,068
* but before the story ends *

922
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:49,807
* he'll kiss her with a sigh *

923
00:41:49,808 --> 00:41:54,344
* would you? Would you? *

924
00:41:54,345 --> 00:42:02,345
* if the girl were I,
would you? Would you? *

925
00:42:03,421 --> 00:42:08,559
* and would you dare to say *

926
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:16,560
* let's do the same as they? *

927
00:42:18,837 --> 00:42:26,837
* I would, would you... *

928
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,283
well, that lets me out.

929
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:34,685
That all your dough?

930
00:42:34,686 --> 00:42:36,053
Every dime.

931
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:38,623
Here's 100 bucks.
Go get yourself a cup of coffee.

932
00:42:38,624 --> 00:42:39,790
Gee, thanks, Blackie.

933
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:41,859
I guess I'll get some sleep.

934
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,061
Hey, chick. Put this
stuff away, will you?

935
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,062
Good morning.

936
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:45,864
Good morning.

937
00:42:45,865 --> 00:42:46,865
Good morning, Burley.

938
00:42:46,866 --> 00:42:48,332
Anything I can do for you?

939
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:51,001
I want to buy that
contract you have
with miss Blake.

940
00:42:51,002 --> 00:42:52,469
You think it's for sale?

941
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,972
I don't see why
you're so stubborn
about it, Norton.

942
00:42:54,973 --> 00:42:56,641
You might be needing money.

943
00:42:56,642 --> 00:42:58,008
I'm doing all right.

944
00:42:58,009 --> 00:42:59,710
You may be in for
a few difficulties
down here.

945
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,111
What do you mean?

946
00:43:01,112 --> 00:43:03,013
Ever hear of
the Johnson-addi
gambling ordinance?

947
00:43:03,014 --> 00:43:03,949
Yep.

948
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:05,683
You're operating
against the law.

949
00:43:05,684 --> 00:43:07,151
So's every other joint here.

950
00:43:07,152 --> 00:43:08,819
Well, I'm just
telling you, that's all.

951
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,621
You've taken quite an interest

952
00:43:10,622 --> 00:43:12,522
in the little lady, haven't you?

953
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:14,024
I'm only interested
in making her

954
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:16,493
a useful member
of the tivoli
opera company.

955
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:19,129
Yeah. Now, isn't that
sweet of you?

956
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,666
Well, I'll tell you
what I'll do, Burley.

957
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:23,533
If the little lady
wants to leave me,

958
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,302
you can have
her contract
for nothing.

959
00:43:25,303 --> 00:43:26,771
[Mary] * would you? *

960
00:43:26,772 --> 00:43:32,109
* and would you dare to say *

961
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:40,110
* let's do the same as they? **

962
00:43:40,385 --> 00:43:41,652
Mary?

963
00:43:41,653 --> 00:43:43,387
Yes?

964
00:43:43,388 --> 00:43:45,023
Come here a minute, will you?

965
00:43:46,658 --> 00:43:48,192
You're taking
a long chance,
Blackie.

966
00:43:48,193 --> 00:43:51,863
Yep. Maybe I got an Ace
or two in the hole, too.

967
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:54,364
Oh, Mr. Burley.

968
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:55,432
Good morning, miss Blake.

969
00:43:55,433 --> 00:43:57,067
Thank you for the lovely roses.

970
00:43:57,068 --> 00:43:58,769
I'm so glad you liked them.

971
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:00,371
Sit down, kid.

972
00:44:01,406 --> 00:44:03,808
Mr. Burley wants to
buy your contract from me.

973
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:05,776
I told you I wasn't giving up.

974
00:44:05,777 --> 00:44:07,912
You really
think I'm ready
for the tivoli?

975
00:44:07,913 --> 00:44:09,413
Yes, but what's more important,

976
00:44:09,414 --> 00:44:10,647
baldini thinks so.

977
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,283
Oh!

978
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,054
What do you say, kid?

979
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:20,191
Would you like to
sell my contract,
Mr. Norton?

980
00:44:21,459 --> 00:44:22,761
No.

981
00:44:27,899 --> 00:44:30,200
I'm very sorry.
I can't accept.

982
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:33,303
Too bad, Burley. I hope
I can do you a favor sometime.

983
00:44:33,304 --> 00:44:34,338
Thanks, Norton.

984
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:36,140
Would you thank
signor Baldini
for me?

985
00:44:36,141 --> 00:44:37,742
You've both been more than kind.

986
00:44:37,743 --> 00:44:39,710
It's been a pleasure,
and I hope to show you

987
00:44:39,711 --> 00:44:42,112
another side of
San Francisco, if I may.

988
00:44:42,113 --> 00:44:43,247
Thank you.

989
00:44:43,248 --> 00:44:44,681
Good-bye, Norton.

990
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,483
So long.

991
00:44:46,484 --> 00:44:49,186
You wouldn't take 5,000
to tear up that contract,
would you?

992
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:50,187
Nope.

993
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,156
10,000?

994
00:44:51,157 --> 00:44:53,190
Are you trying to
make an impression?

995
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:55,292
I said he could have
your contract for nothing

996
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:57,094
if you wanted to leave.

997
00:44:57,095 --> 00:44:59,964
I'm afraid the tivoli will
have to struggle along, Burley.

998
00:44:59,965 --> 00:45:01,265
Did you do that, Blackie?

999
00:45:01,266 --> 00:45:04,168
Sure. You made
your own choice, kid.

1000
00:45:04,169 --> 00:45:06,737
And I hope you'll never
be sorry, miss Blake.

1001
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:08,205
Good-bye.

1002
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:09,440
Good-bye.

1003
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:14,144
Oh, that was awfully
generous of you--

1004
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:15,746
about the contract, I mean.

1005
00:45:15,747 --> 00:45:17,281
Oh, forget it.

1006
00:45:17,282 --> 00:45:18,415
Say, look, kid.

1007
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:20,250
You've heard a lot about
the tivoli opera house

1008
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:21,986
from mugs that never
get anywhere.

1009
00:45:21,987 --> 00:45:23,553
Now I'm going to tip you off

1010
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,155
to a few facts about
the paradise.

1011
00:45:25,156 --> 00:45:26,257
Come on.

1012
00:45:30,195 --> 00:45:31,395
Ever been here?

1013
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:32,297
No.

1014
00:45:32,298 --> 00:45:34,064
Well, I don't do
much office work,

1015
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,466
but here's where
I keep my records.

1016
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:38,302
Take a hinge at those cups.

1017
00:45:38,303 --> 00:45:40,037
Every year,
the wine agents in town,

1018
00:45:40,038 --> 00:45:41,906
Freddie Duane and all the rest,

1019
00:45:41,907 --> 00:45:43,874
pull off an event called
the chicken's ball.

1020
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:45,075
Ever hear of it?

1021
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:45,877
No.

1022
00:45:45,878 --> 00:45:47,444
You know what happens there?

1023
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:50,214
They have a competition
and give a prize
of $10,000 in gold

1024
00:45:50,215 --> 00:45:53,350
to the proprietor
of the joint who puts on
the most artistic show,

1025
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:55,953
and you know who's won it
three times running?

1026
00:45:55,954 --> 00:45:57,687
The paradise.

1027
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:58,789
Oh, that's fine.

1028
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:00,324
For artistic achievement.

1029
00:46:00,325 --> 00:46:02,827
That's what they said
when they slipped me
the trophy.

1030
00:46:02,828 --> 00:46:04,594
Artistic achievement.

1031
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,196
That's wonderful.

1032
00:46:06,197 --> 00:46:08,698
Ain't I telling you?
I'm going to win it
the next time, too,

1033
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:10,400
and the dough goes
to the campaign fund

1034
00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:12,938
for those little mugs
down here on the coast.

1035
00:46:14,873 --> 00:46:19,911
Hey. You know,
I like to look into
those big lamps of yours.

1036
00:46:24,015 --> 00:46:27,785
If you ever cut this,
I'll put some in my watch.

1037
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:32,824
I'm crazy about you, kid.
You know it, don't you?

1038
00:46:41,399 --> 00:46:42,867
What's the matter?

1039
00:46:42,868 --> 00:46:43,934
Nothing.

1040
00:46:43,935 --> 00:46:45,903
Well, you look kind of scared.

1041
00:46:45,904 --> 00:46:47,637
I guess maybe I am.

1042
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,173
Of what?

1043
00:46:49,174 --> 00:46:51,876
You.

1044
00:46:51,877 --> 00:46:54,578
Are you sure it's me
you're afraid of?

1045
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:57,481
Well, what do you think
we should do about it?

1046
00:46:57,482 --> 00:46:58,582
Nothing.

1047
00:46:58,583 --> 00:47:01,251
Nothing? Oh, because you
don't want to, maybe.

1048
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:04,989
If that's it, don't
be afraid to spill it,
and we'll call it a day.

1049
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:06,423
Oh, but it isn't right.

1050
00:47:06,424 --> 00:47:07,557
What isn't right?

1051
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:10,194
For a man and a woman
to be stuck on each other?

1052
00:47:10,195 --> 00:47:12,596
Have you anything
better than that
in Colorado?

1053
00:47:12,597 --> 00:47:16,234
If you have, I'd like
to take a whirl at it.
It must be immense.

1054
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:27,377
How does it feel
to feel like a woman
and be afraid of it?

1055
00:47:27,378 --> 00:47:28,745
Oh, Blackie, listen.

1056
00:47:28,746 --> 00:47:30,314
If you're going to
preach, please sing.

1057
00:47:30,315 --> 00:47:31,815
That's what I believe in.

1058
00:47:31,816 --> 00:47:33,350
Your voice.
The way you move.

1059
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:35,920
The way you stand
on those pretty
little feet of yours.

1060
00:47:35,921 --> 00:47:37,454
That's what I believe in.

1061
00:47:37,455 --> 00:47:40,157
Don't you believe
in anything more
than that?

1062
00:47:40,158 --> 00:47:41,691
What more is there?

1063
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:42,826
God.

1064
00:47:42,827 --> 00:47:44,294
God? Ha ha ha!

1065
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:46,931
Isn't he supposed to be
taking care of the suckers

1066
00:47:46,932 --> 00:47:48,565
that come down to the missions

1067
00:47:48,566 --> 00:47:49,733
looking for help?

1068
00:47:49,734 --> 00:47:51,701
I've seen them
on their knees
asking for things

1069
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,203
they should stand up
and fight for.

1070
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:55,672
I don't see god
coming down and giving
them a shortcut.

1071
00:47:55,673 --> 00:47:57,074
That's not what I want.

1072
00:47:57,075 --> 00:47:59,309
I want to push over
the mugs in my way

1073
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:01,078
before they push me over.

1074
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:03,713
What I believe in
is not up in the air.

1075
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,749
It's in here and in here.

1076
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:07,817
But maybe that's not right.

1077
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:09,987
Maybe it's not right
to feel alive,

1078
00:48:09,988 --> 00:48:12,523
like you and I feel
this minute...

1079
00:48:15,493 --> 00:48:17,594
But I think it's right.

1080
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:21,365
Mary, I want to
get a kick out of
things I can see,

1081
00:48:21,366 --> 00:48:24,168
like lights on the harbor
or a good fight

1082
00:48:24,169 --> 00:48:25,869
or a woman worth looking at.

1083
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:30,107
Did you ever taste
a fog in your mouth,
like it was salt,

1084
00:48:30,108 --> 00:48:34,578
or take hold of someone
and feel your blood
rushing like a river?

1085
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:37,914
What more does a man need,
or a woman, either?

1086
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,350
You know, I never tried
to kid you, Mary.

1087
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:43,153
You take me as I am,
or you don't take me.

1088
00:48:43,154 --> 00:48:45,755
Tim doesn't try
to change me because
he knows he can't,

1089
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,324
and you can't, either.

1090
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:48,926
Nothing can.

1091
00:48:50,228 --> 00:48:52,529
You know what
I've been waiting for?

1092
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:54,864
I've been waiting
to hear you say

1093
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:57,135
I'm all right with you
the way I am.

1094
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,604
Maybe you're ready
to say it now.

1095
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:02,273
Are you?

1096
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:06,276
I don't know.

1097
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:08,546
Well, it's about time.

1098
00:49:12,417 --> 00:49:14,418
Oh, it's going to
be swell, baby.

1099
00:49:14,419 --> 00:49:16,220
I'll make you
queen of the coast.

1100
00:49:16,221 --> 00:49:17,854
You'll ride
in your own carriage,

1101
00:49:17,855 --> 00:49:19,423
and everybody will know
who you are.

1102
00:49:19,424 --> 00:49:22,526
I'll plaster your
name and face clear
to the golden gate.

1103
00:49:22,527 --> 00:49:25,062
You and I together
are going to find out

1104
00:49:25,063 --> 00:49:27,665
that we don't need
anything else but us.

1105
00:49:32,337 --> 00:49:33,271
Hey, look.

1106
00:49:33,272 --> 00:49:34,871
How about going upstairs

1107
00:49:34,872 --> 00:49:36,873
and having some chop suey, huh?

1108
00:49:36,874 --> 00:49:38,376
Come on.

1109
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:47,984
[Man]
Watch me

1110
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,419
and keep your mind on my feet.

1111
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:52,456
Watch this wing.
See? That's it.

1112
00:49:52,457 --> 00:49:54,991
Then you do a sort of a--

1113
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:55,992
what's the matter?

1114
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,461
Come on, let's--

1115
00:49:57,462 --> 00:49:59,229
that's right, Trixie.
You can knock off.

1116
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,698
Everybody's going to
have champagne on me!

1117
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:04,634
Dig up some pommery
for the boys and girls.

1118
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:05,802
All we got is semillon.

1119
00:50:05,803 --> 00:50:08,639
That champagne.
It's enough to
make me dizzy.

1120
00:50:12,777 --> 00:50:15,212
A guy gets killed.

1121
00:50:15,213 --> 00:50:17,181
Can I order you some breakfast?

1122
00:50:17,182 --> 00:50:19,649
No, thanks. Mary and I
will have chop suey upstairs.

1123
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:22,486
Mary, I have
another new number
I'd like you to try.

1124
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:24,221
Oh, no, no.
Not this morning.

1125
00:50:24,222 --> 00:50:27,491
Mat! Tell Charlie--
never mind. I'll
tell him myself.

1126
00:50:27,492 --> 00:50:30,227
Stay right here, honey.
I won't be a minute.

1127
00:50:30,228 --> 00:50:33,030
[Girl]
Gee, I haven't had
any champagne since--

1128
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:42,173
nice going, sister.
You done all right.

1129
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:50,647
[Humming]

1130
00:50:50,648 --> 00:50:53,583
Knock off, Maggie.
You're going to have
champagne.

1131
00:50:53,584 --> 00:50:54,452
Me, too?

1132
00:50:54,453 --> 00:50:56,019
Well, I'd like to know why not.

1133
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:59,189
Oh, Mr. Blackie,
I haven't had any
of that for a long time!

1134
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:01,024
Here's to Blackie!

1135
00:51:01,025 --> 00:51:05,195
Blackie! Blackie!

1136
00:51:05,196 --> 00:51:07,564
Where's Mary?

1137
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:10,033
Oh, I guess
she went upstairs
to set the table.

1138
00:51:10,034 --> 00:51:11,668
Here's to you, darlin'.

1139
00:51:11,669 --> 00:51:13,103
I wish I had me youth.

1140
00:51:13,104 --> 00:51:15,004
I wish I'd never had mine.

1141
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:18,542
Why, Trixie.
That's not nice, baby.

1142
00:51:18,543 --> 00:51:22,212
[Man] Tell Mary here's to her!

1143
00:51:22,213 --> 00:51:24,714
Babe, when
that runs out,
open up some more.

1144
00:51:24,715 --> 00:51:25,616
You bet I will.

1145
00:51:25,617 --> 00:51:27,551
Tell Mary
here's to her, Blackie.

1146
00:51:27,552 --> 00:51:29,619
Sure. "Everyone to
his own taste,"

1147
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,755
the old lady said
as she kissed
the cow.

1148
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:35,493
Ha ha! Ain't that--
what's the matter,
no sense of humor?

1149
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:40,630
Oh, Blackie!

1150
00:51:40,631 --> 00:51:41,698
Oh, hello, Tim!

1151
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:43,600
I just came
to talk about
the campaign.

1152
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:46,770
Oh. Look,
Tim, do you mind
coming back later?

1153
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:47,771
Sure. Sure.

1154
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:51,409
Oh, by the way, Blackie,
I just saw Mary.

1155
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:55,445
Yeah. I put her in a cab.

1156
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:57,181
She said to tell you good-bye

1157
00:51:57,182 --> 00:51:58,748
and that she was taking you up

1158
00:51:58,749 --> 00:52:01,050
on your offer to let her
out of that contract.

1159
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:03,653
What? What's that?

1160
00:52:03,654 --> 00:52:06,323
Well, you said she
could go, didn't you?

1161
00:52:06,324 --> 00:52:07,491
Well, yes, but--

1162
00:52:07,492 --> 00:52:09,092
she's gone to the tivoli,

1163
00:52:09,093 --> 00:52:10,560
and I'm glad
you did it, Blackie.

1164
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:12,796
This was no place for her.

1165
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:14,664
Oh, you think not, eh?

1166
00:52:14,665 --> 00:52:16,366
Of course not.

1167
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:18,502
Neither did you, did you?

1168
00:52:18,503 --> 00:52:20,103
You think
she's better off
at the tivoli

1169
00:52:20,104 --> 00:52:22,439
under the management
of Jack Burley, huh?

1170
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,508
She'll be safe
with Burley, Blackie.

1171
00:52:24,509 --> 00:52:28,513
You see, uh...
She doesn't love him.

1172
00:52:31,582 --> 00:52:33,817
Huh!

1173
00:52:33,818 --> 00:52:36,320
Now look, Tim. You like
chop suey, don't you?

1174
00:52:36,321 --> 00:52:37,921
Chop--sure.

1175
00:52:37,922 --> 00:52:39,390
Come upstairs.
We'll have some.

1176
00:52:48,233 --> 00:52:49,566
Good evening, ladies.

1177
00:52:49,567 --> 00:52:52,168
Good evening and get out.

1178
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,370
The child has
a performance to give.

1179
00:52:53,371 --> 00:52:54,871
Oh, no. We've got to thank him.

1180
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:56,139
Do let him stay.

1181
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:57,841
Alone, I suppose.

1182
00:52:57,842 --> 00:52:59,209
That's right.

1183
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:00,510
Come on, Louise.

1184
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:04,449
In my day, the opera came first.

1185
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:07,751
My mother's out there
tonight, Mary.

1186
00:53:07,752 --> 00:53:08,752
Is she?

1187
00:53:08,753 --> 00:53:10,487
Yes. She came
all the way from New York.

1188
00:53:10,488 --> 00:53:13,590
I guess she got tired
of reading about you
in my letters.

1189
00:53:13,591 --> 00:53:16,393
Well, in a few hours,
you'll be famous.

1190
00:53:16,394 --> 00:53:19,128
Before the whole town
is at your feet,

1191
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:20,830
I want to put in my bid.

1192
00:53:20,831 --> 00:53:24,668
I love you, Mary,
and I want you to marry me.

1193
00:53:24,669 --> 00:53:28,204
I've always wanted you,
from the moment I first
set eyes on you,

1194
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:31,207
but I didn't realize then
howi wanted you.

1195
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,409
Well, I--

1196
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:34,177
please don't try to
answer me now.

1197
00:53:34,178 --> 00:53:36,714
I just wanted you
to know how I felt.

1198
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:40,651
Good luck, darling.

1199
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:47,924
How do you do, Mr. Burley?

1200
00:53:47,925 --> 00:53:48,925
Good evening.

1201
00:53:48,926 --> 00:53:50,159
How do you do?

1202
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,695
Fine, thank you.

1203
00:53:51,696 --> 00:53:52,762
How are you?

1204
00:53:52,763 --> 00:53:54,030
Fine, thanks.

1205
00:53:54,031 --> 00:53:55,333
Thank you.

1206
00:53:56,133 --> 00:53:57,467
I'll be right with you.

1207
00:53:57,468 --> 00:53:59,337
Want to take a look out front.

1208
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:02,406
Hello there, Mr. Burley.

1209
00:54:02,407 --> 00:54:05,041
Hello there.
Jonathan.

1210
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:06,910
What a thrilling first night.

1211
00:54:06,911 --> 00:54:08,044
I hope so.

1212
00:54:08,045 --> 00:54:10,847
Mr. Burley, we can't wait
to hear the new star.

1213
00:54:10,848 --> 00:54:11,682
Hello, Jack.

1214
00:54:11,683 --> 00:54:13,617
Have you seen signor Baldini?

1215
00:54:13,618 --> 00:54:14,919
Not yet.

1216
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,822
Hello, Jack.
Big night, eh?

1217
00:54:18,823 --> 00:54:20,657
I hope so, senator.

1218
00:54:20,658 --> 00:54:21,459
Hi.

1219
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:22,860
Good evening.

1220
00:54:24,862 --> 00:54:26,062
Hello, Norton.

1221
00:54:26,063 --> 00:54:27,063
Good evening.

1222
00:54:27,064 --> 00:54:28,298
Good evening.

1223
00:54:28,299 --> 00:54:29,599
I didn't
know you were
a first-nighter.

1224
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,701
I am tonight.
I came to close you up.

1225
00:54:31,702 --> 00:54:32,802
To what?

1226
00:54:32,803 --> 00:54:34,771
Close you up. You've got
a girl appearing here

1227
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:36,506
that's under contract to me.

1228
00:54:36,507 --> 00:54:38,742
No, you're wrong.
You abrogated
that contract.

1229
00:54:38,743 --> 00:54:40,610
You gave her
permission to leave.

1230
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:43,947
I gave her a choice,
and she said she'd stay,

1231
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:45,649
so the contract stands.

1232
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:47,884
Look. See that man over there?

1233
00:54:47,885 --> 00:54:50,487
The one with
the big black mustache?

1234
00:54:50,488 --> 00:54:53,523
Well, that big, stupid-looking
man represents the law,

1235
00:54:53,524 --> 00:54:54,824
and he's got a paper

1236
00:54:54,825 --> 00:54:56,560
that's going to stop
your prima Donna

1237
00:54:56,561 --> 00:54:58,362
right in the middle
of her first cantata.

1238
00:54:58,363 --> 00:54:59,629

1413
01:08:01,178 --> 01:08:03,779
Well, all right.
Bring him back.

1414
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:05,415
O.K.

1415
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:10,719
You know, you're a funny kid.

1416
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,155
Why?

1417
01:08:12,156 --> 01:08:16,192
Why, the way you act,
anyone would think
that wasn't becoming.

1418
01:08:16,193 --> 01:08:17,826
Are you happy?

1419
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:19,862
Yes. Yes.
Yes, I'm happy.

1420
01:08:19,863 --> 01:08:21,431
That's good.

1421
01:08:23,867 --> 01:08:26,602
Blackie, Blackie,
let's set the date
for our wedding now

1422
01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:29,238
so we can
tell father Tim
when he comes in.

1423
01:08:29,239 --> 01:08:31,274
Yeah, sure. Anytime.
Oh, but look,

1424
01:08:31,275 --> 01:08:33,209
it's got to be after election.

1425
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:34,210
Oh, really?

1426
01:08:34,211 --> 01:08:35,678
The mob down here

1427
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:37,646
know how I've always
kidded that sort of thing.

1428
01:08:37,647 --> 01:08:40,216
I can't back down now
and make a fool of myself

1429
01:08:40,217 --> 01:08:41,550
just before election.

1430
01:08:41,551 --> 01:08:44,220
It would lose me too many votes.

1431
01:08:44,221 --> 01:08:46,655
It means a lot to me
to win this fight,

1432
01:08:46,656 --> 01:08:49,192
not just for putting it
over on Burley,

1433
01:08:49,193 --> 01:08:52,628
but for the coast.
You understand?

1434
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:56,632
Yes. Yes, I do.
I do understand.

1435
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:58,734
We'll sneak off to Sacramento,

1436
01:08:58,735 --> 01:09:01,370
and I'll let you
slip the halter on me.

1437
01:09:01,371 --> 01:09:04,106
Say, I never thought
I'd be so goofy
about anyone.

1438
01:09:04,107 --> 01:09:06,875
[Knock on door]

1439
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:08,545
Come in.

1440
01:09:09,879 --> 01:09:11,013
Hello, Tim.

1441
01:09:11,014 --> 01:09:12,682
Good evening, father.

1442
01:09:16,953 --> 01:09:18,387
What's wrong?

1443
01:09:18,388 --> 01:09:20,889
Are you out of your mind?

1444
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:22,225
Why?

1445
01:09:22,226 --> 01:09:24,660
Showing Mary
like this to that
mob out there.

1446
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:27,863
Like this?
What's wrong with her?

1447
01:09:27,864 --> 01:09:29,298
What's wrong with her?

1448
01:09:29,299 --> 01:09:30,699
Yeah, sure.

1449
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:34,237
What's wrong with
my being proud
to show her off?

1450
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:37,373
Blackie, don't you
understand what I'm
trying to tell you?

1451
01:09:37,374 --> 01:09:39,908
Wait a minute.
I'm making her
queen of the coast.

1452
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:41,410
You see those posters there?

1453
01:09:41,411 --> 01:09:43,779
5,000 of them
will be plastered
all over San Francisco

1454
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:47,383
and 10,000 for ashcans
and the front
of trolley cars.

1455
01:09:47,384 --> 01:09:50,219
I'm not going to
let you do this,
Blackie.

1456
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:53,789
I don't get you, Tim.
You never butted in
on me before.

1457
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:55,291
Well, I am now.

1458
01:09:55,292 --> 01:09:58,194
You're not going to
exploit this girl.

1459
01:09:59,329 --> 01:10:01,197
Come here, Mary.

1460
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:04,733
Will you tell his holiness

1461
01:10:04,734 --> 01:10:07,936
that you made up
your own mind
to come back?

1462
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:10,038
I love him, father.

1463
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,340
That isn't love, Mary.

1464
01:10:11,341 --> 01:10:14,577
Is that so?
Well, it happens
to suit me.

1465
01:10:14,578 --> 01:10:17,513
It isn't love
to let him drag you
down to his level.

1466
01:10:17,514 --> 01:10:21,183
Say, wait a minute, Tim.
I'm going to marry her.

1467
01:10:21,184 --> 01:10:23,419
Not if I can stop you.

1468
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:25,354
You can't take
a woman in marriage

1469
01:10:25,355 --> 01:10:27,256
and then sell her immortal soul.

1470
01:10:27,257 --> 01:10:30,826
Immortal soul?
Now, look, I don't go
for that kind of talk.

1471
01:10:30,827 --> 01:10:32,761
Don't believe
in that nonsense
and never have!

1472
01:10:32,762 --> 01:10:35,431
You better get back
to the half-wits
that do!

1473
01:10:35,432 --> 01:10:36,832
[Man]
Blake's on next.

1474
01:10:36,833 --> 01:10:38,200
Mary, come with me.

1475
01:10:38,201 --> 01:10:39,702
I'm running this joint.

1476
01:10:39,703 --> 01:10:42,170
You take care
of your suckers.
I'll take care of mine.

1477
01:10:42,171 --> 01:10:43,939
She's not going out there.

1478
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:46,875
I've listened to your
psalm-singing blather
and never squawked.

1479
01:10:46,876 --> 01:10:49,345
You can't bring it in here.
This is my joint!

1480
01:10:49,346 --> 01:10:51,079
Miss Mary Blake!

1481
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,982
She's not going out there.

1482
01:11:06,162 --> 01:11:08,464
The place is crazy without you.

1483
01:11:08,465 --> 01:11:10,300
Get out there, kid.

1484
01:11:17,073 --> 01:11:19,508
Wait a minute.
You leave now,

1485
01:11:19,509 --> 01:11:21,711
and you're never coming back!

1486
01:11:23,413 --> 01:11:25,881
[Crowd yelling]

1487
01:11:25,882 --> 01:11:27,483
[Pounding]

1488
01:11:27,484 --> 01:11:29,319
[Women screaming]

1489
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:34,790
Hey, Blackie!
Hey, Blackie,
it's Burley!

1490
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:36,792
He's giving the joint the works!

1491
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:38,961
You can't buck a guy like that.

1492
01:11:38,962 --> 01:11:40,363
Shut up.

1493
01:11:40,364 --> 01:11:42,799
Look at it. Come on.

1494
01:11:46,536 --> 01:11:48,604
Hey, Blackie!
Blackie, look!

1495
01:11:48,605 --> 01:11:51,640
Look at what
they're doing
to our joint!

1496
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:53,543
You see what they're doing?

1497
01:12:10,226 --> 01:12:11,727
Is Mrs. Burley in?

1498
01:12:11,728 --> 01:12:12,961
She's in the small cellar.

1499
01:12:12,962 --> 01:12:15,364
What do you think
of our little shack?

1500
01:12:15,365 --> 01:12:16,665
Oh, but it's magnificent.

1501
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:18,734
We only have one real treasure.

1502
01:12:18,735 --> 01:12:20,537
She's waiting to meet you.

1503
01:12:29,946 --> 01:12:33,549
Ha ha ha!
You needn't
sneak up on me.

1504
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:35,083
I know you're there.

1505
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:36,084
[Kiss]

1506
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:37,353
Mary...

1507
01:12:38,522 --> 01:12:40,088
This is my mother.

1508
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:41,557
How do you do, my dear?

1509
01:12:41,558 --> 01:12:43,158
How do you do, Mrs. Burley?

1510
01:12:43,159 --> 01:12:44,560
Maisie, have you been

1511
01:12:44,561 --> 01:12:46,562
in the house all day?

1512
01:12:46,563 --> 01:12:48,431
I just got back from the races.

1513
01:12:48,432 --> 01:12:51,567
You're even prettier
close to than you were
from me box at the tivoli.

1514
01:12:51,568 --> 01:12:53,569
Oh, so are you, Mrs. Burley.

1515
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:55,771
Oh, go on with you.
Get out.

1516
01:12:55,772 --> 01:12:57,172
Get out? Me?

1517
01:12:57,173 --> 01:12:58,607
Certainly you.

1518
01:12:58,608 --> 01:13:00,643
If I have to sell
this amazing,
beautiful creature

1519
01:13:00,644 --> 01:13:02,377
the idea of joining
the Burley family,

1520
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:05,914
sure, I got to tell
her lies about us
that, heaven help me,

1521
01:13:05,915 --> 01:13:08,050
no son should hear
his mother speak.

1522
01:13:08,051 --> 01:13:10,586
Call me as soon
as you've made
the sale.

1523
01:13:10,587 --> 01:13:11,987
Get out! Get out!

1524
01:13:11,988 --> 01:13:13,989
Sit down, my dear.
Take off your coat.

1525
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:15,023
Thank you.

1526
01:13:15,024 --> 01:13:19,395
Now tell me,
why won't you marry my boy?

1527
01:13:20,497 --> 01:13:21,930
Mrs. Burley, you belong

1528
01:13:21,931 --> 01:13:24,667
to the aristocracy
of San Francisco.

1529
01:13:24,668 --> 01:13:27,335
I'm just
the daughter
of a country parson.

1530
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:30,205
I haven't had
the advantage Jack
deserves in a wife.

1531
01:13:30,206 --> 01:13:31,740
Wait a minute, darling.

1532
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:34,743
I didn't mean
what I said just now
about telling lies.

1533
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:37,312
We'll speak the truth
to each other.

1534
01:13:37,313 --> 01:13:39,682
I think I know
what it's all about.

1535
01:13:39,683 --> 01:13:41,684
It's that rapscallion
Blackie Norton

1536
01:13:41,685 --> 01:13:43,486
you were working for
down on pacific street.

1537
01:13:43,487 --> 01:13:45,020
Listen, Mary.

1538
01:13:45,021 --> 01:13:48,190
I'm an old lady,
and I've been through
a lot in my life.

1539
01:13:48,191 --> 01:13:51,293
I came to San Francisco
in the winter of '51

1540
01:13:51,294 --> 01:13:53,696
in a sailing vessel
around the horn.

1541
01:13:53,697 --> 01:13:57,733
When I got here,
there were 150 males
to one female,

1542
01:13:57,734 --> 01:13:59,768
and if I do say it--
I shouldn't--

1543
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:02,170
I wasn't so hard to look at.

1544
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:04,306
I started business in a shack

1545
01:14:04,307 --> 01:14:06,041
near Portsmouth square
doing washing.

1546
01:14:06,042 --> 01:14:08,276
Do you know how long
me business lasted?

1547
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,712
No.

1548
01:14:09,713 --> 01:14:11,580
About 45 minutes. Ha ha!

1549
01:14:11,581 --> 01:14:13,549
They busted me tub
to smithereens,

1550
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:15,417
and there was
a free-for-all fight

1551
01:14:15,418 --> 01:14:17,720
between five of
the big swells in the town

1552
01:14:17,721 --> 01:14:20,322
to see which one
would take me to lunch,

1553
01:14:20,323 --> 01:14:22,457
so, you see, I got to know men.

1554
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:25,861
I knew all kinds
in them early days,

1555
01:14:25,862 --> 01:14:29,699
and among them was a man
like Blackie Norton.

1556
01:14:31,267 --> 01:14:35,771
He was a selfish and sinful...

1557
01:14:35,772 --> 01:14:38,774
And adorable scoundrel.

1558
01:14:38,775 --> 01:14:44,047
So, you see, I've had
my Blackie Norton, too.

1559
01:14:46,382 --> 01:14:48,751
And you gave him up?

1560
01:14:48,752 --> 01:14:52,387
Yes, yes, I--I gave him up

1561
01:14:52,388 --> 01:14:55,825
because he was killing me soul.

1562
01:14:57,994 --> 01:14:59,796
Killing your soul?

1563
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,398
And I pulled myself together,

1564
01:15:03,399 --> 01:15:06,501
and one day, I married Burley.

1565
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:08,571
Burley was a good, solid man.

1566
01:15:08,572 --> 01:15:11,807
He never got used to
wearing his coat
till the day he died,

1567
01:15:11,808 --> 01:15:14,209
but he built me this mansion,

1568
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:18,146
and every cuspidor
of the place
was 18-carat gold.

1569
01:15:18,147 --> 01:15:22,284
And there came a time
when I was glad I married him

1570
01:15:22,285 --> 01:15:23,786
because he loved me.

1571
01:15:23,787 --> 01:15:27,623
After a while,
Jack was born,
and I had me peace.

1572
01:15:27,624 --> 01:15:33,028
Look, Mary, you say
we're the aristocracy
of San Francisco.

1573
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:34,462
We are.

1574
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:36,031
Listen.

1575
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:37,701
[People laughing]

1576
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:40,704
Come here, Mary.

1577
01:15:45,108 --> 01:15:46,809
Listen to that.

1578
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:49,511
That's the mcdonough mansion--

1579
01:15:49,512 --> 01:15:51,580
aristocrats--

1580
01:15:51,581 --> 01:15:53,515
and that party's been going on

1581
01:15:53,516 --> 01:15:55,951
for two days and nights
straight running.

1582
01:15:55,952 --> 01:15:59,521
There isn't
a rougher joint on
the whole Barbary coast

1583
01:15:59,522 --> 01:16:02,257
than that home
right here on Nob Hill.

1584
01:16:02,258 --> 01:16:04,960
They call this
the wickedest city
in the world,

1585
01:16:04,961 --> 01:16:06,528
and it's a bitter shame, it is,

1586
01:16:06,529 --> 01:16:07,930
for deep down,

1587
01:16:07,931 --> 01:16:10,432
underneath all our evil and sin,

1588
01:16:10,433 --> 01:16:11,800
we've got right here

1589
01:16:11,801 --> 01:16:13,736
the finest set of human beings

1590
01:16:13,737 --> 01:16:16,571
that was ever
rounded up
on one spot.

1591
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:17,940
Sure, they had to have

1592
01:16:17,941 --> 01:16:19,541
wild adventure in their hearts

1593
01:16:19,542 --> 01:16:20,943
and dynamite in their blood

1594
01:16:20,944 --> 01:16:23,111
to come here in the first place.

1595
01:16:23,112 --> 01:16:24,412
That's why they're

1596
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:26,481
so full of untamed deviltry now,

1597
01:16:26,482 --> 01:16:28,316
but we can't go on like this--

1598
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:29,818
sinful and blasphemous,

1599
01:16:29,819 --> 01:16:31,987
with no fear for god
in our hearts.

1600
01:16:31,988 --> 01:16:34,556
That's the reason
why I want my boy

1601
01:16:34,557 --> 01:16:37,092
to have a good woman near him

1602
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:39,695
and to raise
fine, beautiful kids

1603
01:16:39,696 --> 01:16:41,396
for the glory of our heritage.

1604
01:16:41,397 --> 01:16:43,766
You can make a fine man of him,

1605
01:16:43,767 --> 01:16:45,333
and maybe, one day,

1606
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:48,771
you'll be proud
that you met up
with the family

1607
01:16:48,772 --> 01:16:51,907
of old
Maisie Burley,
the washerwoman.

1608
01:16:51,908 --> 01:16:54,777
I'm glad I know you
now, Mrs. Burley.

1609
01:16:54,778 --> 01:16:56,979

You're going to be caught,
so where you going?

Get out!

No rough stuff, now.

Good evening, Charlie.

1622
01:17:36,619 --> 01:17:37,553
I'm sorry.

1623
01:17:37,554 --> 01:17:38,954
What's the charge?

1624

Serving
liquor without
a license.

1625
01:17:40,556 --> 01:17:41,757
We've got a license!

1626

It's been revoked.

1627
01:17:42,892 --> 01:17:44,292
What will the rap be?

1628
01:17:44,293 --> 01:17:46,494
Probably 5,000 fine
and a year in jail.

You know judge cardigan.

1630
01:17:47,897 --> 01:17:49,832
Yeah, I know him,
but Burley knows him better.

1631
01:17:49,833 --> 01:17:51,299
I'd like to help you,

1632
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:53,969
but I have me wife
and me kids
to care for.

1633

I've been counting
on winning that

from the chicken's ball.

1635
01:17:57,707 --> 01:18:00,308
Give me a couple hours
to rustle up bail
and get my entertainers out.

1636
01:18:00,309 --> 01:18:02,510
Well, how about
being at the station

1637
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:04,579
before 6:00 in the morning?

1638
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:05,914
I'll be there.
Thanks.

1639
01:18:05,915 --> 01:18:07,582
It's an outrage!

1640
01:18:07,583 --> 01:18:08,984
Burley's timed this

1641
01:18:08,985 --> 01:18:10,986
so that you can't cop
that prize money tonight.

1642

That's up to him.

01:18:15,591 --> 01:18:16,925
I'll have you all out.

1646
01:18:16,926 --> 01:18:18,593
Well, Blackie, had enough?

1647
01:18:18,594 --> 01:18:19,995
Oh, hello.
What's eating you?

1648
01:18:19,996 --> 01:18:21,596
We can't fight Burley, Blackie.

1649

He's got you buffaloed, eh?

1650

Whoever wins that 10,000
tonight could carry us
through the campaign.

Not if I win it.

that'll top anything
San Francisco's ever known.

has been good to me

Are you fighting for the coast,

fighting for
a personal reason?

01:25:35,498 --> 01:25:37,932
Oh, hello, Della.
I'm glad to
see you again.

1757
01:25:37,933 --> 01:25:39,401
You won't be for long.

1758
01:25:39,402 --> 01:25:42,404
I just dropped over
to tell you what
I think of you.

1759
01:25:42,405 --> 01:25:43,871
I haven't seen this woman

1760
01:25:43,872 --> 01:25:46,408
since she walked out
on the best man
in San Francisco

1761
01:25:46,409 --> 01:25:48,410
to marry the town's
number-one rodent.

1762
01:25:48,411 --> 01:25:50,111
Well, I think
you'd better go,
Della.

1763
01:25:50,112 --> 01:25:53,415
Oh, no. I've got
a few things I want
to tell you, too.

1764
01:25:53,416 --> 01:25:55,417
Now, in case you folks
don't follow me,

1765
01:25:55,418 --> 01:25:57,352
I'll tell you
that this mouse here

1766
01:25:57,353 --> 01:25:59,454
has just had a padlock
put on the paradise

1767
01:25:59,455 --> 01:26:01,223
and thrown all of
Blackie Norton's
performers in jail.

1768
01:26:01,224 --> 01:26:04,259
That's what Blackie got
for picking this phony
up out of the gutter

1769
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:05,960
and giving her a chance.

1770
01:26:05,961 --> 01:26:07,329
Hold still.

1771
01:26:07,330 --> 01:26:10,965
Don't think
I want to breathe
the air near you

1772
01:26:10,966 --> 01:26:13,368
any longer than I have to.

1773
01:26:13,369 --> 01:26:16,037
You ought to
make that mouse
awfully happy.

1774
01:26:16,038 --> 01:26:17,839
Here's a five-spot, brother.

1775
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,342
I'm buying back
me introduction
to you.

1776
01:26:20,343 --> 01:26:22,277
Ladies and gentlemen,

1777
01:26:22,278 --> 01:26:24,379
now, that distinguished
proprietor,

1778
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:27,949
that illustrious showman,
Alaska Joe Kelso,

1779
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:30,719
presents the golden gate trio.

1780
01:26:36,892 --> 01:26:38,760
* there's a big sensation
going around the town *

1781
01:26:38,761 --> 01:26:40,495
* called the Philippine dance *

1783
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:46,167
* there's a big sensation
going around town *

1784
01:26:46,168 --> 01:26:48,069
* you ought to see it
with all your friends... **

1785
01:26:48,070 --> 01:26:49,237
[Della]
Oh, Blackie!

1786
01:26:49,238 --> 01:26:50,938
Beat it, will you?

1787
01:26:50,939 --> 01:26:52,640
Oh, all right, Della.

1788
01:26:52,641 --> 01:26:54,976
Well, how about it, kid?

1789
01:26:54,977 --> 01:26:56,444
Did you get them out?

1790
01:26:56,445 --> 01:26:58,112
Well, what's the matter?

1791
01:26:58,113 --> 01:27:00,181
Aren't there any hockshops open?

1792
01:27:00,182 --> 01:27:01,383
No. It wasn't any use.

1793
01:27:01,384 --> 01:27:02,784
My troupe's being held
without bail.

1794
01:27:02,785 --> 01:27:05,086
Without bail?

1795
01:27:05,087 --> 01:27:07,889
There they are now, celebrating.

1796
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:09,257
Who?

1797
01:27:09,258 --> 01:27:12,093
Oh, Burley and your
ex-nightingale.

1798
01:27:12,094 --> 01:27:13,395
Are they?

1799
01:27:13,396 --> 01:27:14,762
He won't be satisfied

1800
01:27:14,763 --> 01:27:16,898
until you're under a wet rock.

1801
01:27:16,899 --> 01:27:18,500
Why don't you go
curl that dude's
mustache,

1802
01:27:18,501 --> 01:27:20,635
and I'll
kiss the lady
with a bottle?

1803
01:27:20,636 --> 01:27:23,271
Ah, forget it, doll.
Thanks just the same.

1804
01:27:23,272 --> 01:27:25,673
You're a sweetheart
if there ever was one.

1805
01:27:25,674 --> 01:27:27,609
You know,
didn't I give you
this one?

1806
01:27:27,610 --> 01:27:30,878
Yeah. You were just a kid.

1807
01:27:30,879 --> 01:27:32,780
Yeah, that's right.

1808
01:27:32,781 --> 01:27:36,050
* 'cause that's that new tune
called the Philippine dance *

1809
01:27:36,051 --> 01:27:37,319
* oh, get him, Swanee *

1810
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:38,520
* and the first thing
you do, babe *

1811
01:27:38,521 --> 01:27:39,954
* is move both shoulders... **

1812
01:27:39,955 --> 01:27:41,255
where you going, Blackie?

1813
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:42,757
Over to my place.

1814
01:27:42,758 --> 01:27:44,759
Well, I've got to
pack up a few things.

1815
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:46,361
I may be taking a little trip.

1816
01:27:46,362 --> 01:27:47,695
I'll go help you.

1817
01:27:47,696 --> 01:27:49,664
No, no, no.
You stay here
and see the show.

1818
01:27:49,665 --> 01:27:51,766
You come over later
and tell me who won.

1819
01:27:51,767 --> 01:27:53,701
Oh, Blackie,
they say you'll
go up for a year!

1820
01:27:53,702 --> 01:27:55,370
No, no.
I can handle it,

1821
01:27:55,371 --> 01:27:56,904
but I'm worried
about the others.

1822
01:27:56,905 --> 01:27:58,773
Gee, Blackie.

1823
01:27:58,774 --> 01:28:01,577
Your're kind to all
that you know.

1824
01:28:02,911 --> 01:28:04,980

1825
01:28:10,453 --> 01:28:12,053
Ladies and gentlemen,

1826
01:28:12,054 --> 01:28:13,721
the last entry of the evening

1827
01:28:13,722 --> 01:28:15,390
was supposed to have been

1828
01:28:15,391 --> 01:28:17,058
from Mr. Blackie
Norton's paradise.

1829
01:28:17,059 --> 01:28:19,561
But as it is now 4:30

1830
01:28:19,562 --> 01:28:21,329
and the performers
have failed to
arrive,

1831
01:28:21,330 --> 01:28:23,698
why, we'll
close the show
without them.

1832
01:28:23,699 --> 01:28:25,500
Mr. Duane.

1833
01:28:25,501 --> 01:28:28,336
I'm representing
the paradise
for Mr. Norton.

1834
01:28:28,337 --> 01:28:30,938
Mary,
I forbid you
to go up there.

where Blackie
Norton lives?

1837
01:28:39,948 --> 01:28:42,016
Sure.

1838
01:28:42,017 --> 01:28:43,386
Well, go get him.

the appearance
of miss Blake

2107
01:48:44,518 --> 01:48:46,921
Hello, Blackie.

2108
01:49:02,136 --> 01:49:03,905
Thanks, Tim.

2109
01:49:07,942 --> 01:49:10,043
That map
of yours needs
some attention.

2110
01:49:10,044 --> 01:49:10,978
Come on.

2111
01:49:10,979 --> 01:49:12,614
No, no, no.
I'm all right.

2112
01:49:14,582 --> 01:49:16,918
You haven't found
Mary yet, have you?

2113
01:49:19,420 --> 01:49:20,855
No.

2114
01:49:21,989 --> 01:49:23,556
Well, you can't want her

2115
01:49:23,557 --> 01:49:25,091
for the paradise, Blackie.

2116
01:49:25,092 --> 01:49:26,560
That's gone.

2117
01:49:27,995 --> 01:49:31,098
I wasn't thinking
of the paradise, Tim.

2118
01:49:32,566 --> 01:49:35,069
Wait a minute.

2119
01:49:39,006 --> 01:49:41,574
Come on, mug.
I'm going to
take you to Mary.

2120
01:49:41,575 --> 01:49:44,210
You--
is she all right?

2121
01:49:44,211 --> 01:49:45,947
Yeah, she's all right.

2122
01:49:55,489 --> 01:49:57,223
You folks will have
to be vaccinated.

2123
01:49:57,224 --> 01:49:58,324
It's for your own good.

2124
01:49:58,325 --> 01:50:01,228
Joe, take these people
to the hospital tent.

2136
01:51:56,811 --> 01:51:58,879
I want to thank god.

2137
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:00,982
What do I say?

2138
01:52:02,283 --> 01:52:04,818
Just say what's
in your heart,
Blackie.

2143
01:52:20,434 --> 01:52:22,969
I really mean it.
