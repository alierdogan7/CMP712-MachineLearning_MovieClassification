1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,541
<i>So here's what you missed on Glee:</i>

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:03,875
<i>Sue tried to shoot Brittany
out of a cannon, but it wasn't safe,</i>

3
00:00:03,886 --> 00:00:05,918
<i>so Brittany, Santana and Quinn
quit the Cheerios!</i>

4
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:06,838
Sucks for you.

5
00:00:06,862 --> 00:00:08,235
<i>Now we get to see what they
look like in street clothes.</i>

6
00:00:08,266 --> 00:00:09,893
<i>Finn broke up with Rachel
because she made out with Puck,</i>

7
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:11,361
<i>but then Quinn kissed Finn
after the big game,</i>

8
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:12,996
<i>even though she's been
dating Sam. Yikes!</i>

9
00:00:13,064 --> 00:00:15,732
<i>It used to be a love triangle,
and now it's, like, a pentagon.</i>

10
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,500
<i>And that's what you missed
on Glee.</i>

11
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,706
<i>PUCK: We all know I'm not
the smartest guy in the world,</i>

12
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:25,008
<i>but there are two lessons
I learned the hard way.</i>

13
00:00:25,076 --> 00:00:26,576
<i>One: Never punch a cop.</i>

14
00:00:26,644 --> 00:00:30,146
<i>The other one:
You can't choose love.</i>

15
00:00:30,214 --> 00:00:32,349
<i>Love chooses you.</i>

16
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:35,785
<i>I mean, I could have
any girl I wanted,</i>

17
00:00:35,853 --> 00:00:37,754
<i>but here I am,
in the middle of geometry</i>

18
00:00:37,822 --> 00:00:39,723
<i>or English or something,</i>

19
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,192
<i>and the only girl
I've got my eye on is</i>

20
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,693
<i>a whole lot of woman.</i>

21
00:00:43,761 --> 00:00:45,695
<i>I owe it all to Sectionals.</i>

22
00:00:45,763 --> 00:00:47,530
<i>We needed a twelfth member,</i>

23
00:00:47,598 --> 00:00:49,866
<i>and I told her
if she joined the Glee Club,</i>

24
00:00:49,934 --> 00:00:51,735
<i>I'd give her seven minutes
in heaven.</i>

25
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:57,908
<i>But what went down in
that janitor's closet was epic.</i>

26
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:01,044
You're really not good at this,
and you're kind of scrawny.

27
00:01:01,112 --> 00:01:03,847
You got to be kidding me.

28
00:01:05,783 --> 00:01:07,684
Yeah, you're not
turning me on at all.

29
00:01:07,752 --> 00:01:09,653
Later, sad sack.

30
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,388
But that was only three minutes.

31
00:01:11,455 --> 00:01:12,756
Three minutes
I'll never get back.

32
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:15,825
<i>PUCK: Maybe it's
because she's constantly</i>

33
00:01:15,893 --> 00:01:17,494
<i>insulting me, like my mom.</i>

34
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:19,562
<i>Maybe I just dig a chick
with curves,</i>

35
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,464
<i>but it's almost Valentine's Day,
and it's official.</i>

36
00:01:21,532 --> 00:01:24,567
Stare at me again,
and I'll break your nuts.

37
00:01:24,635 --> 00:01:27,704
Also,
these candies you gave me?

38
00:01:27,772 --> 00:01:28,872
They sucked.

39
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,507
But you ate all of them.

40
00:01:30,574 --> 00:01:33,343
I had to make sure
they all sucked.

41
00:01:33,411 --> 00:01:36,386
I'm in love with Lauren Zizes.

44
00:01:42,386 --> 00:01:44,487
<i>does to a person.</i>

45
00:01:44,555 --> 00:01:47,157
<i>I know what you're thinking...
That they're all only into me</i>

46
00:01:47,224 --> 00:01:48,825
<i>because I won the first
Conference Championship</i>

47
00:01:48,893 --> 00:01:51,161
<i>in this school's history,
but I've changed.</i>

48
00:01:51,228 --> 00:01:53,296
<i>I'm walking taller,
carrying a bigger stick</i>

49
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:55,231
<i>and using it
to fight off the ladies.</i>

50
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:58,401
- I love you, Finny-bear.
- Thanks, Becky.

51
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,370
- Oh.
- Be my Valentine?

52
00:02:01,572 --> 00:02:02,339
Awesome.

53
00:02:02,406 --> 00:02:05,842
- I'll keep you posted.
- Copy that.

54
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,945
<i>Yeah, I've been collecting
a lot of hearts lately.</i>

55
00:02:09,013 --> 00:02:11,748
<i>Only question is,
which one to choose.</i>

56
00:02:11,816 --> 00:02:13,416
<i>Bingo.</i>

57
00:02:13,484 --> 00:02:16,286
<i>I just need to go for this.</i>

58
00:02:16,354 --> 00:02:18,521
<i>Maybe the reason
it never worked out with Rachel</i>

59
00:02:18,589 --> 00:02:20,423
<i>was because
I was never over Quinn.</i>

60
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:22,425
<i>I know
I can pry her away from Sam</i>

61
00:02:22,493 --> 00:02:24,427
<i>if I can get her
to kiss me again.</i>

62
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:26,396
<i>The ridiculous thing is
that I could get every girl</i>

63
00:02:26,464 --> 00:02:28,398
<i>in this school
to kiss me but her.</i>

64
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:30,333
<i>Game on.</i>

65
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,747
Okay, I'm all for flair,

66
00:02:36,815 --> 00:02:39,183
but these Valentine Day
decorations are just tacky.

67
00:02:39,251 --> 00:02:41,786
I mean, what the hell
is this supposed to be?

68
00:02:41,853 --> 00:02:43,220
It's clearly puppy love.

69
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,022
It's cute. Come on.

70
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,824
(toy makes smooching sound)
Ooh.

71
00:02:46,892 --> 00:02:48,125
<i>TOY: I love you!</i>

72
00:02:48,193 --> 00:02:49,427
- Oh, this is creepy.
- Adorable.

73
00:02:49,494 --> 00:02:50,728
It's a simple excuse

74
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,997
to sell candy and greeting
cards on a holiday.

75
00:02:53,064 --> 00:02:54,432
Not true.

76
00:02:54,499 --> 00:02:56,534
People have been celebrating
Valentine's Day for centuries.

77
00:02:56,601 --> 00:02:59,370
And call me a hopeless romantic,
but it's my favorite holiday.

78
00:02:59,438 --> 00:03:00,905
Really?

79
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,140
I think there's something
really great about a day

80
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:06,010
where you're encouraged
to just lay it all on the line

81
00:03:06,077 --> 00:03:09,547
and say to somebody,
"I'm in love with you."

82
00:03:09,614 --> 00:03:11,248
You know?

83
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,684
And this year, I want
to do something really radical,

84
00:03:13,752 --> 00:03:15,820
so I need your opinion on this.

85
00:03:15,887 --> 00:03:18,789
Well, there's this guy
that I sort of... like,

86
00:03:18,857 --> 00:03:21,192
and I've only known him
for a little while,

87
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:23,594
but I want to tell him
that I think

88
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:26,163
my feelings are starting
to change into something...

89
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:28,466
deeper.

90
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:29,934
So I have to ask.

91
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,569
Do you think it's too much

92
00:03:31,636 --> 00:03:33,471
to sing to somebody
on Valentine's Day?

93
00:03:33,538 --> 00:03:35,406
Not at all.

94
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,621
WOMAN:
What can I get you?

95
00:03:38,688 --> 00:03:41,624
Uh, a medium drip, and a grande
nonfat mocha for this guy,

96
00:03:41,691 --> 00:03:44,827
and maybe I can get him to split
one of those Cupid cookies.

97
00:03:44,895 --> 00:03:45,961
You know my coffee order?

98
00:03:46,029 --> 00:03:48,664
Of course I do.

99
00:03:48,732 --> 00:03:49,865
WOMAN:
That'll be $8.40.

100
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:52,435
Don't even bother, dummy.
It's on me.

101
00:03:52,502 --> 00:03:53,836
Keep the change.

102
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,389
I do believe I have a new favorite holiday.
(laughs)

103
00:03:59,457 --> 00:04:00,944
(bell ringing)
All right, guys,

104
00:04:00,956 --> 00:04:02,318
I have one word for you.

105
00:04:03,806 --> 00:04:05,628
- Brittany.
- Is it "love"?

106
00:04:05,696 --> 00:04:07,030
I'm totally going
to graduate now.

107
00:04:07,098 --> 00:04:08,981
Valentine's Day is coming up,

108
00:04:09,005 --> 00:04:11,177
so for this week's lesson,

109
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:13,475
I want you guys
to pick a partner,

110
00:04:13,499 --> 00:04:14,732
because you're going
to sing to them

111
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:17,968
what you think is the world's
greatest love song.

112
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,576
Yeah, find a song
that communicates

113
00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:21,744
all the things that
love means to you.

114
00:04:21,812 --> 00:04:23,847
- Now, partner up.
- Mr. Shue, can I say something?

115
00:04:25,049 --> 00:04:26,716
I just wanted to point out that

116
00:04:26,784 --> 00:04:30,286
for the first time,
an entire week has gone by without

117
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:32,455
any one of us getting slushied.
(applause)

118
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:34,190
I think the fact
that I led the football team

119
00:04:34,258 --> 00:04:35,458
to a Conference Championship

120
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:37,460
might have something
to do with it.

121
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:38,995
Fact is that I'm
the closest thing

122
00:04:39,063 --> 00:04:41,197
that this Glee Club has
to a celebrity right now.

123
00:04:41,265 --> 00:04:43,133
And just like a famous athlete,

124
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,567
I want to give to a charity.

125
00:04:44,635 --> 00:04:45,735
You guys.

126
00:04:45,803 --> 00:04:46,936
(scoffing)

127
00:04:47,004 --> 00:04:49,105
So, I'm setting up
a kissing booth

128
00:04:49,173 --> 00:04:51,007
for a dollar a smooch,
and donating the proceeds

129
00:04:51,075 --> 00:04:52,609
to Glee Club to help us...

130
00:04:52,676 --> 00:04:54,444
Don't even act like
you're trying to help this

131
00:04:54,512 --> 00:04:56,479
Glee Club out. You just want
to kiss a bunch of girls.

132
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:57,714
I've kissed Finn,
and can I just say?

133
00:04:57,781 --> 00:04:58,848
Not worth a buck.

134
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,283
I would, however,

135
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:03,153
pay a hundred dollars
to jiggle one of his man-boobs.

136
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,054
Do you ever get tired
of tearing other people down?

137
00:05:05,122 --> 00:05:06,623
- No, not really.
- 'Cause you always

138
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,758
just seem to do be meddling
in everybody else's business.

139
00:05:08,826 --> 00:05:10,627
Oh, please.
You guys love me.

140
00:05:10,694 --> 00:05:12,562
I keep it real,
and I'm hilarious.

141
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,397
Actually, you're just a bitch.

142
00:05:14,465 --> 00:05:16,599
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Okay. I'm sorry.

143
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:18,334
You've just got eyes for my man.

144
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:20,370
Okay, first of all,
I'm not your man.

145
00:05:20,437 --> 00:05:23,173
QUINN: And Finn is right.
All you ever do is insult us.

146
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,774
Three weeks ago, you said

147
00:05:24,842 --> 00:05:26,576
you were disappointed that
I didn't have a lizard baby.

148
00:05:26,644 --> 00:05:28,044
Five minutes ago, you said

149
00:05:28,112 --> 00:05:29,679
Mr. Shue belonged
in a twelve-step program.

150
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:30,847
Wait. What?

151
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:31,981
You're addicted to vests.

152
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:33,550
RACHEL:
The truth is, Santana,

153
00:05:33,617 --> 00:05:35,318
you can dish it out,
but you can't take it.

154
00:05:35,386 --> 00:05:36,753
Okay, maybe you're right.
Maybe I am destined

155
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,454
to play the title role
in the Broadway

156
00:05:38,522 --> 00:05:40,390
musical version of <i>Willow</i>,
but the only job

157
00:05:40,457 --> 00:05:43,126
you're going to have
is working on a pole!

158
00:05:43,194 --> 00:05:44,961
(murmuring)

159
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:46,663
Fine.

160
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,598
Santana...
(bell ringing)

161
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,400
Maybe try rocking
back and forth.

162
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:52,001
People do that in movies.

163
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:57,540
No. 'Cause I just try to be really,
really honest with people

164
00:05:57,608 --> 00:06:00,276
when I think that they suck,
you know?

165
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:02,412
- Yeah.
- No one gets it.

166
00:06:06,016 --> 00:06:07,984
I suppose you want
me to thank you

167
00:06:08,052 --> 00:06:10,420
for sticking up for me today,
except that makes it seem

168
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:12,355
like I need somebody to
stick up for me, so...

169
00:06:12,423 --> 00:06:13,656
Oh, no, no. Trust me.

170
00:06:13,724 --> 00:06:16,392
I... I know you don't need me
to stick up for you.

171
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,161
I mean, you're all
kinds of tough.

172
00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:19,062
- And...
- Mm, that's true.

173
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,664
How about you let me take you

174
00:06:21,732 --> 00:06:23,132
to Breadstix
for Valentine's Day?

175
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,735
Do you seriously
think it's that easy?

176
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:28,304
I'm not desperate,
so if you really want this,

177
00:06:28,372 --> 00:06:30,073
you best come correct.

178
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,743
Because I spell
woman Z-I-Z-E-S,

179
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:36,713
and I need to be wooed,
you understand me?

180
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,782
- Wooed.
- Damn.

181
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:45,086
Hey.

182
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,053
What you doing?

183
00:06:46,121 --> 00:06:47,522
Nothing.

184
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:50,158
Just, uh, daydreaming,
plotting weekend outfits.

185
00:06:50,225 --> 00:06:51,492
Well, come on.

186
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,361
You're going
to want to see this.

187
00:06:53,429 --> 00:06:56,297
I've called an emergency meeting
of the Warblers' Council.

188
00:06:56,365 --> 00:06:57,465
Oh, sounds serious.

189
00:06:57,533 --> 00:06:58,699
Let's hope not.

190
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:01,102
I just need to ask them
a tiny little favor.

191
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,837
WES: This emergency meeting
is called to order.

192
00:07:02,905 --> 00:07:06,307
Junior member Blaine Anderson,
the floor is yours.

193
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,943
Esteemed council,
I'll be brief.

194
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,546
Simply put...

195
00:07:11,613 --> 00:07:14,115
I'm in love.

196
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,384
Ooh!
(laughter)

197
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:18,686
Congrats.

198
00:07:18,754 --> 00:07:20,922
I'm not really good
at talking about my feelings.

199
00:07:20,989 --> 00:07:22,690
I'm much better at singing them.

200
00:07:22,758 --> 00:07:25,493
But still,
I could use a little help.

201
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:27,862
Which is why I'm asking
to enlist the Warblers

202
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:34,569
to help serenade this individual
in song off-campus.

203
00:07:34,636 --> 00:07:35,770
- What?
- What?!

204
00:07:35,838 --> 00:07:37,505
- Off-campus?!
- Are you serious?

205
00:07:37,573 --> 00:07:39,106
(grumbling)
Did I hear you right?

206
00:07:39,174 --> 00:07:43,277
I know what I'm asking
is slightly unusual.

207
00:07:43,345 --> 00:07:44,645
The Warblers haven't performed

208
00:07:44,713 --> 00:07:46,447
in an informal setting
since 1927,

209
00:07:46,515 --> 00:07:48,883
when <i>The Spirit of St. Louis</i>
overshot the tarmac

210
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:50,418
and plowed
through seven Warblers

211
00:07:50,486 --> 00:07:53,120
during an impromptu rendition of
"Welcome to Ohio, Lucky Lindy."

212
00:07:53,188 --> 00:07:54,789
DAVID: Why would
we even consider

213
00:07:54,857 --> 00:07:56,057
what you're asking?

214
00:07:56,124 --> 00:07:57,658
I firmly believe
that our reticence

215
00:07:57,726 --> 00:07:59,060
to perform in public

216
00:07:59,127 --> 00:08:00,194
nearly cost us a trip
to Regionals.

217
00:08:00,262 --> 00:08:01,696
We're becoming privileged,

218
00:08:01,763 --> 00:08:04,198
porcelain birds perched on a...
(overlapping chatter)

219
00:08:04,266 --> 00:08:05,900
You mock us, sir.

220
00:08:05,968 --> 00:08:08,069
(gavel banging)
WES: Thad, David?

221
00:08:08,136 --> 00:08:10,371
- I will have order.
- May I please say something?

222
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,010
With respect,
I believe Blaine has a point.

223
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:19,013
The Warblers are so
concerned with image

224
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,215
and tradition
that sometimes I feel like

225
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:24,552
we miss out on opportunities to
step outside our comfort zones.

226
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,920
When I was on New Directions,

227
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:29,190
we performed in front
of hostile crowds

228
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,424
pretty much anywhere we went.

229
00:08:30,492 --> 00:08:32,827
I mean, mattress stores,
shopping malls.

230
00:08:32,895 --> 00:08:34,695
I had a cat thrown at me
in a nursing home once.

231
00:08:34,763 --> 00:08:35,596
(quiet chuckles)

232
00:08:35,664 --> 00:08:37,965
But it...
It gave us confidence.

233
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:39,967
It kept us loose.

234
00:08:40,035 --> 00:08:41,969
And where would this performance
take place?

235
00:08:42,037 --> 00:08:44,338
The Gap at the North Hills Mall.

236
00:08:44,406 --> 00:08:48,175
I'd like to call it
The Warblers' Gap Attack.

237
00:08:48,243 --> 00:08:49,944
(soft chuckles)
Why the Gap?

238
00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:52,413
The guy that I like
is a junior manager.

239
00:08:52,481 --> 00:08:53,648
(gavel bangs)

240
00:08:53,715 --> 00:08:57,184
WES: All right, well,
all those in favor?

241
00:08:57,252 --> 00:08:59,420
KURT: I was absolutely devastated.
♪ I know something about... ♪

you two were dating?

Well, not in so many words.

244
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,061
Well, did he put the moves on?

245
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,996
No, but we were
always singing duets,

246
00:09:09,064 --> 00:09:10,898
and he was always
smiling at me.

thing in my head, didn't I?

00:09:16,805 --> 00:09:18,306
Listen, we've all been there.

250
00:09:18,373 --> 00:09:20,274
At least I have.

251
00:09:20,342 --> 00:09:21,943
- With you.
- I know exactly what you mean.

252
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,144
I mean, if Finn thinks

253
00:09:23,211 --> 00:09:25,012
that he's just gonna
walk out of my life,

254
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,581
he's wrong, 'cause
I'm gonna go up

255
00:09:26,648 --> 00:09:27,682
to that kissing booth tomorrow

256
00:09:27,749 --> 00:09:30,284
with a $100 bill and he's not
gonna be able to make change,

257
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:31,752
and then he's gonna be forced

258
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,987
to kiss me one hundred times,
and when his lips touch mine,

259
00:09:33,055 --> 00:09:35,456
- I'm telling you, he's gonna feel it.
- Hey, hey.

260
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:36,691
We're supposed to be giving
Kurt advice, remember?

261
00:09:36,758 --> 00:09:38,426
Yeah.

262
00:09:38,493 --> 00:09:40,428
You are going to the Gap Attack,
though, right?

263
00:09:40,495 --> 00:09:41,963
Should... Should I?

264
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,164
- Yes!
- Mm-hmm.

265
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:44,765
MERCEDES:
Scope out the competition.

266
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,534
See what this guy's like.

267
00:09:46,602 --> 00:09:49,537
You know,
you two are both so guy crazy.

268
00:09:49,605 --> 00:09:51,038
Yeah. Look at me.

269
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:52,740
I don't have a date
for Valentine's Day,

270
00:09:52,808 --> 00:09:54,175
and I could give a rip.

271
00:09:54,242 --> 00:09:56,277
The three of us are divas.

272
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,612
Look at our idols.

273
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:00,114
Whitney, Barbra, Patti LuPone.

274
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,683
They all became stars
while they were single.

275
00:10:02,751 --> 00:10:06,954
They took all the pain and loneliness,
and they put it into their music.

276
00:10:07,022 --> 00:10:08,556
People could relate to it.

277
00:10:08,624 --> 00:10:10,591
Yeah, everybody feels lonely.

278
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:13,494
Harnessing this pain is why
they became legends.

279
00:10:13,562 --> 00:10:16,597
Why has this never
occurred to me?

280
00:10:16,665 --> 00:10:19,634
Sometimes you have to choose
between love and talent.

281
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:21,869
And as far as I'm concerned,

282
00:10:21,937 --> 00:10:24,171
we all need
to fly solo for a while.

283
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:30,444
It's so nice to be around girls,
for a change.

RACHEL: Good job.

322
00:12:55,157 --> 00:12:58,259
So, um, what'd you think?

323
00:12:58,326 --> 00:13:00,060
It was... That's kind
of my love song to you,

324
00:13:00,128 --> 00:13:02,329
'cause, you know,
you're a little...

325
00:13:02,397 --> 00:13:03,430
On the heavier side, but,

326
00:13:03,498 --> 00:13:04,832
like the song says, you know,

327
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,066
I'm kind of into it.

328
00:13:06,134 --> 00:13:08,202
So...

329
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,838
That was the first time anyone
ever sang me a love song.

330
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,341
And it made me feel like crap.

331
00:13:18,814 --> 00:13:20,214
(school bell ringing)

332
00:13:23,318 --> 00:13:24,685

333
00:13:24,753 --> 00:13:28,656

Oh...

337
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,893
Sorry, ladies.

338
00:13:32,961 --> 00:13:34,195
Brush and floss time.

339
00:13:34,262 --> 00:13:35,796
Got to keep up the oral hygiene

340
00:13:35,864 --> 00:13:38,432
if I'm gonna satisfy
all of you. Sorry.

341
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,434
I know why you're doing this.

342
00:13:40,502 --> 00:13:41,702
You know I'm
the only girl in school

343
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,937
that won't kiss you,
and you think

344
00:13:43,004 --> 00:13:44,638
that the peer pressure
will get to me.

345
00:13:44,706 --> 00:13:47,208
Well, it is sort of uncool that you...
You're too uptight

346
00:13:47,275 --> 00:13:49,510
to spend a buck for a
good cause like Glee Club.

347
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,378
I'm not kissing you again.

348
00:13:51,446 --> 00:13:53,814
What are you so afraid of?

349
00:13:53,882 --> 00:13:56,750
Leading you on,
hurting my boyfriend.

350
00:13:56,818 --> 00:13:58,986
Your boyfriend's a boy.

351
00:13:59,054 --> 00:14:01,622
Tell me you don't want
to kiss me right now.

352
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,658
I can't do this.

353
00:14:12,107 --> 00:14:13,541
I saw it.

354
00:14:13,609 --> 00:14:15,810
Your guys' faces, were, like,
right up next to each other.

355
00:14:15,878 --> 00:14:16,911
Kissing distance.

356
00:14:18,314 --> 00:14:20,248
What are these things?

357
00:14:20,316 --> 00:14:22,250
They're called records.

358
00:14:22,318 --> 00:14:24,152
People used to listen
to music on them.

359
00:14:24,219 --> 00:14:26,321
I'm looking for a classic
love song to sing to you

360
00:14:26,388 --> 00:14:28,056
for our assignment,
because despite your confusion

361
00:14:28,123 --> 00:14:29,757
about the matter,
you are the only guy

362
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:31,192
I'm ever within
kissing distance of.

363
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,393
Okay. So answer
me this, then.

364
00:14:32,461 --> 00:14:34,429
Why haven't you kissed
Finn at his booth yet?

365
00:14:34,496 --> 00:14:37,265
Okay, first you're all up in
my business for kissing Finn,

366
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,900
and now you're pissed at
me for not kissing...

367
00:14:38,968 --> 00:14:40,635
It's odd. Something seems fishy.
I mean...

368
00:14:40,703 --> 00:14:42,203
(laughs)
This is insane.

369
00:14:42,271 --> 00:14:43,771
Shh!

370
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,173
Everyone thinks I'm dumb.

371
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,008
Not... everyone.

372
00:14:47,076 --> 00:14:48,276
But I'm not.

373
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:50,378
At least...
not about you.

374
00:14:50,446 --> 00:14:52,680
You play it cool,
but you're ambitious.

375
00:14:52,748 --> 00:14:54,782
You like being the queen bee,

376
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,385
and you think being with star
quarterback Finn is going to

377
00:14:57,453 --> 00:14:58,853
put you up there,
whether you're wearing

378
00:14:58,921 --> 00:15:01,623
a Cheerios! uniform or not.
I'm pretty, but I ain't dumb.

379
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:05,727
Fine. Right after Glee rehearsal,
I'm kissing Finn.

380
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,397
(school bell ringing)

381
00:15:09,465 --> 00:15:11,766
Thanks.

382
00:15:14,103 --> 00:15:15,403
Are you sure
you can handle this?

383
00:15:15,471 --> 00:15:16,904
Oh, absolutely.

384
00:15:16,972 --> 00:15:18,539
I've decided that
I'm better off without you.

385
00:15:18,607 --> 00:15:21,643
Not without you specifically,

386
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,711
but without any man
who's going to keep me

387
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:25,279
from achieving
my goals of stardom.

388
00:15:25,347 --> 00:15:27,715
Sweet. Uh...

389
00:15:27,783 --> 00:15:29,183
Well, we should probably kiss.

390
00:15:29,251 --> 00:15:30,385
There's a line-up.

391
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:36,958
What... What the hell?
On the cheek?

392
00:15:37,026 --> 00:15:39,827
Wait, I thought you
said you were over me.

393
00:15:39,895 --> 00:15:41,029
I am, but I still...

394
00:15:41,096 --> 00:15:42,296
I still want a real kiss.

395
00:15:42,364 --> 00:15:43,564
That was not a dollar kiss.

396
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:45,133
I knew you were lying
about being through

397
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,067
with love and all that stuff.

398
00:15:46,135 --> 00:15:47,502
Okay, fine. I still love you.

399
00:15:47,569 --> 00:15:48,936
Okay? Is that
what you want to hear?

400
00:15:55,377 --> 00:15:57,812
Why can't you just forgive me?

401
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,747
You cheated on me.
That means something.

402
00:15:59,815 --> 00:16:00,848
What does it mean?

403
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,316
That I was stupid?
That I was angry?

404
00:16:02,384 --> 00:16:04,285
I... I don't care about Puck.

405
00:16:04,353 --> 00:16:06,754
I don't care
about anybody but you.

406
00:16:14,496 --> 00:16:15,563
It's Valentine's Day.

407
00:16:15,631 --> 00:16:16,731
Oh, yeah.

408
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:18,766
I ordered it for
you for Christmas

409
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:20,568
before we broke up.

410
00:16:20,636 --> 00:16:22,103
Just open it.

411
00:16:30,646 --> 00:16:33,381
I think you're right

412
00:16:33,449 --> 00:16:35,483
about wanting to be
alone for a while.

413
00:16:35,551 --> 00:16:36,884
'Cause let's face it, Rachel.

414
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:38,786
You're better than
everyone in this school.

415
00:16:38,854 --> 00:16:41,622
You don't need me or any other
guy to anchor you to Lima.

416
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,658
You're a real star.

417
00:16:43,726 --> 00:16:45,393
And you need to shine.

418
00:16:45,461 --> 00:16:48,730
Just because I
can't be with you,

419
00:16:48,797 --> 00:16:50,732
it doesn't mean I
don't believe in you.

420
00:16:55,738 --> 00:16:57,705
Thank you.

421
00:16:57,773 --> 00:16:59,574
(school bell ringing)

422
00:17:03,612 --> 00:17:05,046
It's weird.
Who'd have guessed

423
00:17:05,114 --> 00:17:07,548
that the quiet, skinny Asian guy
and the kid in the wheelchair

424
00:17:07,616 --> 00:17:10,184
would end up dating two of
the raddest girls in school?

425
00:17:10,252 --> 00:17:14,422
- No jealousy. No drama.
- Nope.

426
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,723
I don't know how we did it.

427
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,291
I do.

428
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,761

I'm so in love,

482
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:13,875
- I may just start crying.
- Aw...

483
00:19:13,942 --> 00:19:15,776
(school bell ringing)

484
00:19:17,112 --> 00:19:18,613
What's that?

485
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,881
It's a receipt.

486
00:19:19,948 --> 00:19:21,015
I went to Jared.

487
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,618
You can reimburse me,
we'll have dinner at Breadstix,

488
00:19:23,685 --> 00:19:24,986
and then we can
consider this settled.

489
00:19:25,053 --> 00:19:27,855
Um, no.
And consider what settled?

490
00:19:27,923 --> 00:19:29,156
Look, you've made your point.

491
00:19:29,224 --> 00:19:30,191
I'm sort of a bitch.

492
00:19:30,259 --> 00:19:31,826
But I'm willing to change.

493
00:19:31,894 --> 00:19:33,194
I won't tell Lauren

494
00:19:33,262 --> 00:19:34,729
to look out for poachers
who might mistake her

495
00:19:34,796 --> 00:19:36,397
for the endangered White Rhino.

496
00:19:36,465 --> 00:19:37,665
LAUREN: I heard that.

497
00:19:37,733 --> 00:19:40,468
Don't make me rip that
weave out ya head.

498
00:19:40,535 --> 00:19:42,603
This is not gonna be good.

499
00:19:42,671 --> 00:19:43,771
Hello, Lauren.

500
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:47,275
- You are a beautiful person.
- Thank you.

501
00:19:47,342 --> 00:19:50,011
Now, get out of my way, please,
a-fores I ends you.

502
00:19:50,078 --> 00:19:51,779
You don't want to push me.

503
00:19:51,847 --> 00:19:54,815
Oh. But, see, I...
I sort of do.

504
00:19:54,883 --> 00:19:58,886
I'm from a part of town
called Lima Heights adjacent.

505
00:19:58,954 --> 00:20:01,255
You know where that is,
Poppin' Fresh?

506
00:20:01,323 --> 00:20:04,392
It's on the wrong
side of the tracks.

507
00:20:10,465 --> 00:20:12,400
(Lauren screaming)

508
00:20:15,103 --> 00:20:16,570
(screaming)

509
00:20:16,638 --> 00:20:17,972
Hey!

510
00:20:25,814 --> 00:20:28,382
(grunting)

511
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:31,018
(yelling)

512
00:20:33,221 --> 00:20:35,189
(Santana screaming)

513
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:38,759
(shouts)

514
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:43,631
Hey! Knock it off and get going!

515
00:20:43,699 --> 00:20:47,368
Yeah. That's how we do it
in Lima Heights.

516
00:20:47,436 --> 00:20:49,270
BEISTE: Get you to the nurse.

517
00:20:51,073 --> 00:20:52,840
Please go out with me.

518
00:20:52,908 --> 00:20:54,542
Just... Please.

519
00:20:54,609 --> 00:20:56,978
You make a formal presentation,

520
00:20:57,045 --> 00:20:58,746
and I'll consider it.

521
00:21:01,817 --> 00:21:02,984
(school bell ringing)

522
00:21:08,312 --> 00:21:11,125
SAM: Wait. Hold on.
I want to see this.

523
00:21:11,193 --> 00:21:13,260
- Pervert?
- I'd prefer "chaperone,"

524
00:21:13,328 --> 00:21:14,161
and also "boyfriend."

525
00:21:32,681 --> 00:21:34,682
Satisfied?

526
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,650
- Yeah. Let's go.
- Hmm.

527
00:21:36,718 --> 00:21:38,819
So I took a bunch
of those records

528
00:21:38,887 --> 00:21:40,321
you were looking at
in the library,

529
00:21:40,389 --> 00:21:41,589
and I'm gonna load
them into my iTunes.

530
00:21:41,656 --> 00:21:43,357
Hey, I forgot my purse.

531
00:21:45,227 --> 00:21:47,995
Meet me tomorrow afternoon
in the auditorium.

532
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:52,633
Fireworks.

533
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,948
That's him.
The blonde one folding sweaters.

534
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:57,949
Hmm.

535
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:00,085
I can see the appeal.

536
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:01,119
That's quite a head of hair.

537
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:02,854
His name is Jeremiah.

538
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:06,158
If he and I got married,
the Gap would give me a 50% discount.

539
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:09,861
This is insane.
I don't know what I'm doing.

540
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:11,029
We haven't even really
gone out on a date.

541
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:12,697
We shouldn't do this.
This is crazy.

542
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:14,065
Okay. Come on.
Come on. Man up.

543
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,267
You're amazing.

544
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,202
He's gonna love you.

00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:03,068
Jeremiah. Hey.

608
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:05,870
- What the hell were you doing?
- What?

609
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:06,905
I just got fired.

610
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:09,641
You can't just bust a groove

611
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:11,009
in the middle of
somebody else's workplace.

612
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:14,346
- But they loved it.
- Well, my boss didn't.

613
00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:15,747
Neither did I.

614
00:25:15,815 --> 00:25:18,350
No one here knows I'm gay.

615
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:20,018
Can I be honest?
Just, with the hair?

616
00:25:20,086 --> 00:25:21,753
I think they do.

617
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:24,556
Blaine, let's just be clear here.

618
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:26,324
You and I got coffee twice.

619
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:27,592
We're not dating.

620
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:31,563
If we were, I'd get arrested,
'cause you're underage.

621
00:25:41,474 --> 00:25:42,507
(school bell ringing)

622
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:43,775
Oh, yeah.
That's my ear.

623
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:45,110
That's my ear.
I love it. I like it.

624
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,781
<i>SANTANA: Ugh, gross.</i>

628
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:57,522

00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,823
<i>I'll just marry an NFL player.</i>

630
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,592
<i>They're super reliable.</i>

631
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:07,399
<i>Wait, that's weird.</i>

632
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:09,100
<i>Quinn's wearing
her queen bitch smirk,</i>

633
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:11,603
<i>and Finn only wears

635

00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,511
<i>They're fooling around.</i>

637
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,578

00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:21,780

<i>(chuckles)</i>

640
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:29,320
<i>Well, I think it's time

641
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:31,156
<i>Revenge.</i>

642
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:34,426
<i>I've always loved volunteering
at the local hospital,</i>

643
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:36,961
<i>and not just because of the
sexy candy striper outfit.</i>

644
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:39,898
<i>Giving back is so important.</i>

645
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,833
Excuse me.

646
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:44,269
Are there any sick students
I can help you tend to?

647
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:46,638
Wes Fahey's down with mono

648
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,573
and he's waiting for
his mom to pick him up.

649
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:51,075
But you shouldn't go in there.
It's highly contagious.

650
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:54,979
Please. I've had mono so many times,
it turned into stereo.

651
00:26:58,818 --> 00:26:59,984
Hi.

652
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:03,922
So, I'm gonna need
to borrow your germs.

653
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,201
WES: Thanks.

654
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:22,040
Whoa, whoa.

655
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:24,409
Sorry about that.
I couldn't help myself.

656
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:27,445
If I have anything,
I hope it's not contagious.

657
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:28,913
But what? What?

658
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:35,420
Hi. Hi.

659
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:36,788
(school bell rings)

660
00:27:36,856 --> 00:27:39,791
- What is this place?
- It's the library.

661
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:42,560
Haven't you been in here before?

662
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:45,530
No? Okay.
I don't understand.

663
00:27:45,598 --> 00:27:46,998
You said you want
to formally ask me out,

664
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:50,168
but I see no envelope of cash,
no muffin basket.

665
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:53,204
- I sang to you.
- An offensive song.

666
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:55,740
(sighs)

667
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:57,509
I don't think you're
ready for this jelly.

668
00:27:57,576 --> 00:28:00,011
Wait. I mean,
let's be honest here,

669
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:01,579
you look...

670
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:03,281
the way you look.

671
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,216
And I'm embracing that.

672
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:08,486
- I mean, it turns me on, babe.
- I look like America looks.

673
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:10,255
And, like America,

674
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:12,657
I need more than just a song
to get my juices flowing.

675
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,698
Lauren Zizes, will you go

676
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:22,467
to Breadstix
with me tomorrow night?

677
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:24,502
Tomorrow's not Valentine's Day.

678
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,271
Tomorrow's the pre-date.

679
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:28,439
'Cause our mouths are going
to be too busy macking out

680
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:30,108
on Valentine's Day
to eat anything.

681
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,677
(chuckles)

682
00:28:32,745 --> 00:28:34,445
I like your style, Puckerman.

683
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:36,381
I dine at 8:00.

684
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,084
Now, get out of here,
before I change my mind.

685
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:41,486
Yeah.

686
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:43,388
(school bell ringing)
Good-bye.

687
00:28:45,491 --> 00:28:47,725
Sorry. I was at church.

688
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:50,295
- Praying for the strength to come?
- Not to.

689
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:57,802
You realize this
is making me a cheater,

690
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:01,205
the thing that hurt you so badly

691
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:04,075
that it made you
break up with me.

692
00:29:04,143 --> 00:29:06,010
And Rachel.

693
00:29:08,681 --> 00:29:11,282
You know why it hurt so bad
when you guys cheated on me?

694
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,084
'Cause it meant
you didn't love me.

695
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:15,086
- That's not true.
- No. At least not enough

696
00:29:15,154 --> 00:29:17,722
to not want t to hurt me,
and that's the thing about cheating.

697
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,624
When you really love someone,
you'd do anything

698
00:29:19,692 --> 00:29:20,758
to keep them safe.

699
00:29:20,826 --> 00:29:21,726
I love Sam.

700
00:29:21,794 --> 00:29:23,161
No, you don't.

701
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:24,329
Or else you wouldn't
have come here.

702
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:25,964
Fine.

703
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:27,832
I think I love him.

704
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,467
No matter what happens
between us,

705
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:31,269
I'm not going
to break up with Sam

706
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:33,004
until I know for sure
one way or another.

707
00:29:33,072 --> 00:29:34,405
Okay.

708
00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:36,708
Do you think you can love
two people at one time?

709
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,310
Not totally.

710
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:40,812
You have to choose, eventually.

711
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:42,513
Not yet.

712
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:51,758
(groans)
Don't they have anything here

713
00:29:51,826 --> 00:29:54,494
that isn't covered with stupid,
little hearts?

714
00:29:54,562 --> 00:29:56,296
Gross.

715
00:29:56,364 --> 00:29:59,066
Well, you've certainly
changed your tune.

716
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:02,302
I don't think I've ever made
that big a fool of myself,

717
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,304
which is really
saying something,

718
00:30:04,372 --> 00:30:06,373
because I've performed
at theme parks.

719
00:30:06,441 --> 00:30:07,608
(sighs)

720
00:30:07,675 --> 00:30:11,078
I just... I can't believe
I made it all up in my head.

721
00:30:11,145 --> 00:30:14,581
Okay, can I ask you something?

722
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:17,851
Because we've always been
completely honest with each other.

723
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:23,056
You and I? We hang out.
We sing flirty duets together.

724
00:30:23,124 --> 00:30:24,825
You know my coffee order.

725
00:30:24,893 --> 00:30:27,361
Was I supposed to think
that that was nothing?

726
00:30:27,428 --> 00:30:29,229
What do you mean?

727
00:30:31,065 --> 00:30:33,533
I thought the guy
that you wanted to ask out

728
00:30:33,601 --> 00:30:37,004
on Valentine's Day was me.

729
00:30:41,943 --> 00:30:44,077
Oh, wow.

730
00:30:46,281 --> 00:30:48,115
I really am clueless.

731
00:30:50,718 --> 00:30:53,053
Look, Kurt...

732
00:30:53,121 --> 00:30:55,789
I don't know what I'm doing.

733
00:30:55,857 --> 00:30:58,325
I pretend like I do.

734
00:30:58,393 --> 00:31:00,827
And I know how to
act it out in song,

735
00:31:00,895 --> 00:31:02,763
but the truth is...

736
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:08,802
I've never really been
anyone's boyfriend.

737
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:12,205
Me, neither.

738
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:16,576
Let me be really
clear about something.

739
00:31:16,644 --> 00:31:20,213
I really, really care about you.

740
00:31:20,281 --> 00:31:23,717
But as you and about twenty
mortified shoppers saw,

741
00:31:23,785 --> 00:31:25,519
I'm not very good at romance.

742
00:31:28,189 --> 00:31:30,324
I don't want to screw this up.

743
00:31:32,293 --> 00:31:34,328
So it's just like
<i>When Harry Met Sally</i>.

744
00:31:34,395 --> 00:31:37,331
- But I get to play Meg Ryan.
- Deal.

745
00:31:40,268 --> 00:31:41,835
Don't they, uh,
get together in the end?

746
00:31:43,604 --> 00:31:45,639
Could I get a nonfat mocha,
and a medium drip

747
00:31:45,707 --> 00:31:47,007
for my friend Billy Crystal?

748
00:31:47,075 --> 00:31:48,842
Ah, you know my coffee order.

749
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,744
You know what?

750
00:31:50,812 --> 00:31:53,246
I think I've got something
for us to do on Valentine's Day.

751
00:31:59,053 --> 00:32:00,454
(sighs)

752
00:32:00,521 --> 00:32:01,955
Thanks for doing this.

753
00:32:02,023 --> 00:32:03,490
It really takes the sting off.

754
00:32:03,558 --> 00:32:05,092
It's cool.
My dad's a drug addict,

755
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:06,293
so losers make me horny.

756
00:32:06,361 --> 00:32:08,061
I'm not a loser.

757
00:32:08,129 --> 00:32:09,696
This is the first time
I've ever been stood up.

758
00:32:09,764 --> 00:32:11,832
Must be some chick
to blow you off.

759
00:32:14,168 --> 00:32:17,070
Michelle, I've been covering
your section for fifteen minutes.

760
00:32:17,138 --> 00:32:18,271
Your break's over.

761
00:32:18,339 --> 00:32:19,840
And your husband called.

762
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:23,210
(school bell ringing)

763
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:24,378
(sighs)

764
00:32:24,445 --> 00:32:26,279
Well, I did it.

765
00:32:26,347 --> 00:32:28,415
I kissed every girl
in this school,

766
00:32:28,483 --> 00:32:31,351
and raised $324
for the Glee Club.

767
00:32:31,419 --> 00:32:33,120
WILL:
All right, Finn. Thanks.

768
00:32:33,187 --> 00:32:34,688
That'll pay for half a
ticket to Nationals.

769
00:32:34,756 --> 00:32:35,722
So...
(chuckles)

770
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,424
Still a long way to go.

771
00:32:37,492 --> 00:32:38,592
All right?

772
00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:40,027
Okay.

773
00:32:40,094 --> 00:32:43,296
Now I believe it's time to hear
what the world's greatest

774
00:32:43,364 --> 00:32:45,665
love song means to
Ms. Tina Cohen-Chang.

775
00:32:45,733 --> 00:32:46,833
- Come on up.
- Whoo!

776
00:32:46,901 --> 00:32:48,602
FINN: Is anyone else hot?

777
00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:49,870
It's really stuffy in here.

778
00:32:49,937 --> 00:32:52,372
This is for you, Mike.
Happy Valentine's Day.

- Almost too powerful.
- I love you, Mike.

803
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:25,098
Mr. Shue, can I be excused?
I don't feel well.

804
00:34:25,166 --> 00:34:28,435
Me, either. I feel sick.

805
00:34:28,503 --> 00:34:29,836
Let me guess.

806
00:34:29,904 --> 00:34:31,271
You have a sore throat,
and your glands are swollen,

807
00:34:31,339 --> 00:34:32,706
and you're feverish.

808
00:34:32,773 --> 00:34:36,276
Yeah. Yeah, which is why
I need to go to the nurse.

809
00:34:36,344 --> 00:34:38,044
It sounds like you have mono.

810
00:34:38,112 --> 00:34:40,680
Otherwise known
as the kissing disease.

811
00:34:40,748 --> 00:34:42,682
But you know what
really helps spread it?

812
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,251
A little tongue.

813
00:34:44,318 --> 00:34:45,585
Which is weird, because

814
00:34:45,653 --> 00:34:47,687
it sounds like Quinn here has it, too.

815
00:34:47,722 --> 00:34:49,456
SAM: I was there when they kissed.

816
00:34:49,524 --> 00:34:50,757
It was just a peck.

817
00:34:50,825 --> 00:34:52,592
So, how about we stop
talking about tonguing,

818
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,661
and Finn and I go to the nurse?

819
00:34:54,729 --> 00:34:57,898
You know what?
I think that is a capital idea!

820
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:02,575
I've cheated twice in my life.

821
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:04,677
The first time, I got pregnant.

822
00:35:04,745 --> 00:35:06,813
The second time, I got mono.

823
00:35:08,549 --> 00:35:11,518
I think the universe is trying
to tell me something.

824
00:35:11,585 --> 00:35:12,385
FINN: Maybe.

825
00:35:12,453 --> 00:35:14,387
But I think Sam likes you enough

826
00:35:14,455 --> 00:35:16,389
to believe
whatever story you told him.

827
00:35:16,457 --> 00:35:18,625
Santana is such a bitch.

828
00:35:18,692 --> 00:35:20,160
It looks like mono to me.

829
00:35:20,227 --> 00:35:21,861
I called your mothers.

830
00:35:21,929 --> 00:35:24,130
You can hang here
till they pick you up,

831
00:35:24,198 --> 00:35:25,298
but no kissing.

832
00:35:30,604 --> 00:35:32,205
I'm not done with us yet.

833
00:35:34,575 --> 00:35:37,110
You have to stop.

834
00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:39,679
Nothing can happen between us,
until I figure out

835
00:35:39,747 --> 00:35:41,781
what's going on with me and Sam

836
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:44,551
and you figure out what's
going on with you and Rachel.

837
00:35:44,618 --> 00:35:47,754
But... Nothing's...

838
00:35:47,822 --> 00:35:50,123
Nothing's going on
with me and Rachel.

839
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:53,927
All I know is that when
I don't catch you staring at me,

840
00:35:53,994 --> 00:35:56,863
you're staring at her.

841
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:01,634
(school bell ringing)

842
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:04,537
Hello... Lauren.

843
00:36:04,605 --> 00:36:06,172
What's with the chilly willy,
Puckerman?

844
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,143
Honestly, I'm not used
to getting stood up.

845
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:11,845
Last night?

846
00:36:11,912 --> 00:36:13,913
Breadstix?

847
00:36:13,981 --> 00:36:17,283
- Oh, we had a date, didn't we?
- Look, I get it.

848
00:36:17,351 --> 00:36:19,419
You've been hurt by guys before.

849
00:36:19,487 --> 00:36:20,987
But I'm telling you,
I'm not like that.

850
00:36:21,055 --> 00:36:23,323
First of all,
you got a girl pregnant last year,

851
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,657
so, yeah, you are.

852
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:27,260
And B: What makes you assume
guys treat me badly?

853
00:36:27,328 --> 00:36:28,862
I can take care of myself.

854
00:36:28,929 --> 00:36:30,597
That's what I like about you.

855
00:36:30,664 --> 00:36:33,700
I'm not into you because you...
have curves. I...

856
00:36:33,767 --> 00:36:35,401
What I like is
that you're a girl

857
00:36:35,469 --> 00:36:37,137
who's an even bigger bad ass
than me.

858
00:36:37,204 --> 00:36:40,507
Can I be honest with you?

859
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:43,710
I like you. I used to think you
were smokin', but a lot of that

860
00:36:43,777 --> 00:36:45,979
had to do with the fact
that I thought you were

861
00:36:46,046 --> 00:36:48,515
mixed race, and that never
fails to get me going.

862
00:36:48,582 --> 00:36:49,883
But here's the thing, Puckerman.

863
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:52,085
I'm not just looking for
somebody to fool around with,

864
00:36:52,153 --> 00:36:54,821
so if you're really into me,
you got to take it slow.

865
00:36:54,889 --> 00:36:57,790
I suppose
I could give that a shot.

866
00:36:57,858 --> 00:36:59,292
Then you're on for Valentine's Day.

867
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,426
As friends.

868
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,564
(school bell ringing)

869
00:37:07,334 --> 00:37:09,302
Where's Quinn?

870
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:12,071
Uh...

871
00:37:12,139 --> 00:37:15,341
Uh, her mom picked her
up a few hours ago.

872
00:37:15,409 --> 00:37:17,544
Quinn really is very pretty.

873
00:37:19,213 --> 00:37:21,347
You don't have to do that,
you know.

874
00:37:21,415 --> 00:37:24,217
No. I would do it for anyone.

875
00:37:25,819 --> 00:37:27,720
She's prettier than me.

876
00:37:27,788 --> 00:37:30,089
Would you stop?

877
00:37:30,157 --> 00:37:31,991
You're beautiful.

878
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:36,196
I know she is.

879
00:37:36,263 --> 00:37:39,199
It meant so much to me
that you chose me over her.

880
00:37:39,266 --> 00:37:42,235
Girls like me don't get chosen
over girls like her very much.

881
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:44,470
Did you kiss her?

882
00:37:44,538 --> 00:37:47,140
Like Santana said?

883
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:50,510
Yeah, yeah, but I just needed
to get it out of my system.

884
00:37:50,578 --> 00:37:52,679
So, what did it feel like?

885
00:37:52,746 --> 00:37:55,381
When you kissed her?

886
00:37:56,584 --> 00:37:59,219
Fireworks.

887
00:37:59,286 --> 00:38:01,588
Did you see fireworks
when you kissed me?

888
00:38:09,196 --> 00:38:12,098
- Rachel, wait.
- No.

889
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:14,234
It's good. Thank you.

890
00:38:14,301 --> 00:38:17,670
Look, you've given me
the strength to move on.

891
00:38:17,738 --> 00:38:21,107
I know now that there's...
nothing here for me anymore.

892
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:22,909
That's not the truth.

893
00:38:22,977 --> 00:38:26,212
I still... I'm just...

894
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,014
I'm so confused
in my head right now.

895
00:38:28,082 --> 00:38:29,415
No, it's okay.
Look, I understand.

896
00:38:29,483 --> 00:38:31,050
Now I'm free

897
00:38:31,118 --> 00:38:33,920
to pursue my dreams without
anything holding me back.

898
00:38:33,988 --> 00:38:37,190
And you've actually inspired
my song selection

899
00:38:37,258 --> 00:38:38,791

love song assignment.
