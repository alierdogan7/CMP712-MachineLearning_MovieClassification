Five, six, seven, eight.
step, turn,

10
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,234
Out, in, ball-change,
step ball-change step.

11
00:00:23,234 --> 00:00:24,968
You, you, you, you.

12
00:00:24,968 --> 00:00:27,300
And ba-ba-ba. turn...

13
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,601
Come on, guys,
you're sleepwalking on me here.

14
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:31,701
Give me some energy.
we've got sectionals in two...

15
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:34,067
Please, sectionals
is going to be a breeze.

16
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:36,100
Maybe so.

17
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,968
(yawns)
but if we coast
through sectionals,

18
00:00:37,968 --> 00:00:40,801
We're gonna get
killed at regionals.

19
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:42,968
We have got to be on our game.

20
00:00:42,968 --> 00:00:44,934
(zany voices)
(laughing)

21
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,534
Sorry.
funny youtube.

22
00:00:47,534 --> 00:00:49,100
It's the grape stomping one.

23
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,734
(zany voices continue)

24
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:54,100
The kids have gotten
really complacent.

25
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,133
It's like the fire
has totally gone out.

26
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:59,167
Um, um, i'm sorry,
you've just, uh...

27
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:00,901
You've got a little

28
00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:04,501
Mustard in your cute
kirk douglas chin dimple.

29
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:05,501
(laughs)

30
00:01:05,501 --> 00:01:07,968
Wha...? huh?

31
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:09,667
I get it?

32
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:10,968
Um...

33
00:01:10,968 --> 00:01:12,667
Here, let me.

34
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:14,100
Hold on.

35
00:01:15,734 --> 00:01:17,767
There.

36
00:01:18,934 --> 00:01:19,968
Thanks.

37
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:23,334
Um, so...

38
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:25,634
Uh, when did... when did
this start to happen?

39
00:01:25,634 --> 00:01:27,868
A week ago.

40
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:30,801
Rachel:
one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

41
00:01:30,801 --> 00:01:33,467
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.
great news, guys.

42
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:35,100
Just got the competition
bracket for sectionals,

43
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,367
And we are in really good shape.

44
00:01:37,367 --> 00:01:38,634
There's only two other teams.

45
00:01:38,634 --> 00:01:40,467
We beat them,
we make it to regionals.

46
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:42,033
(laughter and cheers)

47
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:43,901
Uh, who are the other teams?

48
00:01:43,901 --> 00:01:46,001
Drumroll please, finn.

49
00:01:46,001 --> 00:01:47,234
(drumroll)

50
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,967
School for the deaf in dayton

51
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:52,134
And someplace called
jane addams academy.

52
00:01:52,134 --> 00:01:53,567
Jane addams?
that's a halfway house

53
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:55,268
For girls just getting out
of juvie.

54
00:01:55,268 --> 00:01:57,300
Th-th-this is great.

55
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,700
People who can't hear
what they're singing

56
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,934
And criminals
who don't care.

57
00:01:59,934 --> 00:02:01,534
It's gonna be
a cakewalk.

58
00:02:01,534 --> 00:02:03,168
High fi...

59
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:05,467
<i>will:
they think they've got it
in the bag,</i>

60
00:02:05,467 --> 00:02:07,834
<i>so they've simply
stopped trying.</i>

61
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:10,634
I've got to figure out
some way to motivate them.

62
00:02:10,634 --> 00:02:13,201
Okay, well, you,
um, you could...

63
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:14,700
Oh, what about
a sticker board?

64
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,034
That's how my parents

65
00:02:16,034 --> 00:02:17,934
Got me to do chores
when i was a kid.

66
00:02:17,934 --> 00:02:19,634
Right, so i'd do a chore

67
00:02:19,634 --> 00:02:21,201
And then i'd get a star,
and then...

68
00:02:21,201 --> 00:02:23,367
oh, dear god,
please, please...

69
00:02:23,367 --> 00:02:25,067
Stop talking.

70
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:27,367
I'm trying desperately
to ignore

71
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:29,667
The treacly sweet inanity

72
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,600
Of our asinine
conversation,

73
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,400
But now i've got bile
in my mouth

74
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,734
And i will hold my tongue
no further.

75
00:02:35,734 --> 00:02:37,067
You know what this is?

76
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:39,234
It's a list
of my cheerios.

77
00:02:39,234 --> 00:02:40,934
Every week i pick
someone at random

78
00:02:40,934 --> 00:02:42,400
And i kick them out.

79
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,700
Yeah, well, in glee club we do
things a little bit differently.

80
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,867
Oh, yeah, will?

81
00:02:45,867 --> 00:02:47,567
How's that working out
for you?

82
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,801
You have to
remember something.

83
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:52,001
We're dealing with children.

84
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:54,201
They need to be terrified.

85
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:56,168
It's like mother's milk
to them.

86
00:02:56,168 --> 00:03:00,201
Without it, their bones
won't grow properly.

87
00:03:00,201 --> 00:03:02,134
So if you want results
with a kid,

88
00:03:02,134 --> 00:03:05,134
You find that competitive
animal within and unleash it.

89
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:08,034
Okay.

90
00:03:08,034 --> 00:03:09,867
Ellen, that blouse
is just insane.

91
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:17,600
I can't believe she's allowed
to teach at this school.

92
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,134
You know...

93
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:22,134
She may have a point.

94
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,134
<font color="#ffff00">captioning sponsored by</font>
<font color="#ffff00">20th century fox</font>

95
00:03:28,134 --> 00:03:30,034
Competition.

96
00:03:30,034 --> 00:03:32,034
Every one of these people
or elements

97
00:03:32,034 --> 00:03:34,067
Was a champion
in their own right.

98
00:03:34,067 --> 00:03:35,634
But they used competing
with each other

99
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:37,534
To make themselves
even better.

100
00:03:37,534 --> 00:03:39,700
I don't understand
how lightning

101
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,901
Is in competition with an
above-ground swimming pool.

102
00:03:41,901 --> 00:03:44,067
Just go with it.

103
00:03:44,067 --> 00:03:45,433
You guys have become
complacent.

104
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,433
You were great at
the invitational,

105
00:03:47,433 --> 00:03:49,500
But you got to up your game
if you want

106
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,567
To get through sectionals.

107
00:03:50,567 --> 00:03:52,333
Okay, split up.

108
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,534
Guys on the left side,
girls on the right side.

109
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:57,333
Let's go, come on.

110
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,901
All right.

111
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:05,168
Kurt.

112
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,934
Here's the deal.

113
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:15,600
Two teams-- boys versus girls.

114
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,101
One week from today,

115
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:20,600
You will each perform
a mash-up of your choice.

116
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,234
What's a mash-up?

117
00:04:22,234 --> 00:04:24,201
A mash-up is when
you take two songs

118
00:04:24,201 --> 00:04:25,367
And mash them together

119
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:26,734
To make an even

120
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:28,901
Richer explosion
of musical expression.

121
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,700
Boys will perform on tuesday,
girls the next day.

122
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,901
I want you guys

123
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:34,201
To go all out, okay,
costumes, choreography.

124
00:04:34,201 --> 00:04:36,567
Whoever wins
the competition

125
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,901
Gets to choose the number

126
00:04:38,901 --> 00:04:40,234
That we do for
sectionals.

127
00:04:40,234 --> 00:04:41,400
Wait, who's going
to be the judge?

128
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,734
Your gender
makes you biased.

129
00:04:43,734 --> 00:04:45,967
Ah...

130
00:04:45,967 --> 00:04:47,234
There is going to be

131
00:04:47,234 --> 00:04:48,667
A celebrity judge.

132
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:50,234
Wh-who?

133
00:04:50,234 --> 00:04:53,400
Oh, you're going to have
to show up to find out.

134
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,433
We got this in the bag.
totally.

135
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:57,834
I'm going to start storyboarding
our choreography tonight.

136
00:04:57,834 --> 00:05:00,300
Hey, i hope you guys
are up for this competition.

137
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,834
The girls look pretty pumped.

138
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,400
We're planning on smacking them
down like the hand of god.

139
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:06,967
(yawns)

140
00:05:06,967 --> 00:05:08,600
Hey, finn, you all right?

141
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,801
You seem a little
out of it.

142
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:13,134
Yeah, i'm just
a little worn out.

143
00:05:13,134 --> 00:05:14,801
Puck:
come on, dude.

144
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:16,867
We're late
for football practice.

00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:42,700

183
00:06:55,734 --> 00:06:59,101
<i>i'll just have
to destroy the man.</i>

184
00:07:02,201 --> 00:07:03,867
Let me be frank.

185
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:05,667
Your husband is
hiding his kielbasa

186
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:09,300
In a hickory farms gift basket
that doesn't belong to you.

187
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,634
What?!

188
00:07:10,634 --> 00:07:11,867
With who?

189
00:07:11,867 --> 00:07:12,967
Guidance counselor.

190
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:14,567
Real floozy and
a man-eater.

191
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,600
Wears creepy brooches
like the kind

192
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,734
My nana was buried in.

193
00:07:17,734 --> 00:07:18,734
More tea.

194
00:07:18,734 --> 00:07:20,801
Oh, sorry.

195
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:22,433
It's the same old song.

196
00:07:22,433 --> 00:07:24,300
Wife puts on a couple
extra pounds...

197
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,300
Oh, i'm pregnant.

198
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,667
Oh, that's no excuse.

199
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:29,400
I've always thought the
desire to procreate showed

200
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,967
Deep personal weakness.

201
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:33,433
Me-- never wanted kids.

202
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:35,867
Don't have the time,
don't have the uterus.

203
00:07:36,901 --> 00:07:38,934
Are you sure about this?

204
00:07:38,934 --> 00:07:40,667
A woman always knows.

205
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:42,134
(sighs)

206
00:07:42,134 --> 00:07:44,801
Let me put it to
you this way--

207
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:46,134
If it's not a
full-blown affair,

208
00:07:46,134 --> 00:07:48,001
Well, it's certainly
heading in that direction.

209
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,734
You need a machete
to cut through

210
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:52,268
The haze of lust
that surrounds them.

211
00:07:52,268 --> 00:07:54,634
Oh, god, what am
i going to do?!

212
00:07:54,634 --> 00:07:57,134
I think you should both pack up
and move out of the district.

213
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,767
Unless you want to lose your man

214
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:03,268
To a mentally ill ginger pygmy
with eyes like a bush baby.

215
00:08:03,268 --> 00:08:05,201
Now you're absolutely
sure about this?

216
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:06,467
I mean, you have proof?

217
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:08,634
Get into that school
and sniff out

218
00:08:08,634 --> 00:08:11,168
Those sex pheromones
for yourself.

219
00:08:11,168 --> 00:08:12,967
We happen to have an opening.

220
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:16,001
Our school nurse,
mrs. lancaster, is in a coma.

221
00:08:16,001 --> 00:08:19,333
Oh, she took a terrible tumble
down the stairwell yesterday.

222
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,934
(bell ringing)

223
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,201
(screams)

224
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:26,433
But i'm not a nurse.

225
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:28,101
I work at sheets n' things.

226
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:29,367
I'm not an american citizen.

227
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:30,801
I was born in the
panama canal zone.

228
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,867
But i managed to
get a passport.

229
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:34,333
I've run for office twice.

230
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,767
My advice to you,

231
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:38,534
If you want to keep
your husband...

232
00:08:40,534 --> 00:08:44,333
...get creative.

233
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,067
Mrs. schuester,

234
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,967
I appreciate your interest
in the nursing position.

235
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:50,367
But your previous
experience

236
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:52,367
Is limited to folding
hand towels.

237
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:54,634
As assistant manager
at sheets n' things,

238
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,234
I've had first aid training.

239
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:57,500
Mm-hmm.

240
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,034
I've also used a defibrillator.

241
00:09:00,034 --> 00:09:01,600
Hmm.

242
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:05,034
So what did you want
to talk to me about?

243
00:09:05,034 --> 00:09:06,867
Oh, good news.

244
00:09:06,867 --> 00:09:09,001
I figured out a way
to get the kids motivated.

245
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:10,567
They're going to compete
against each other

246
00:09:10,567 --> 00:09:12,034
In a glee-off.

247
00:09:12,034 --> 00:09:15,001
Oh.
and guess who the celebrity
judge is going to be?

248
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:16,333
You.

249
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,934
Me?

250
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:20,201
You are the most

251
00:09:20,201 --> 00:09:23,834
Honest and impartial person
i know.

252
00:09:25,834 --> 00:09:28,934
Well, isn't this
a surprise.

253
00:09:28,934 --> 00:09:30,634
Terri, wh-what
are you doing here?

254
00:09:30,634 --> 00:09:32,934
Hi. i don't think we've
been properly introduced.

255
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:34,834
I'm terri schuester,
will's pregnant wife.

256
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:36,433
Hi.

257
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:38,400
Oh, honey,

258
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,534
Someone got a little lipstick
on your cup.

259
00:09:40,534 --> 00:09:42,567
(gasps)

260
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:44,400
I got it.

261
00:09:47,901 --> 00:09:50,201
Um, is everything okay, terri?

262
00:09:50,201 --> 00:09:51,767
You-you never visit me at work.

263
00:09:51,767 --> 00:09:53,367
Oh, i'm not visiting.

264
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,801
No.

265
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:58,001
You've been so stressed
about our finances lately,

266
00:09:58,001 --> 00:10:00,901
That i thought i would pitch in
by getting a second job.

267
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:04,934
I'm the new school nurse.

268
00:10:04,934 --> 00:10:07,101
But you're not a nurse.

269
00:10:07,101 --> 00:10:08,467
You don't have
any training.

270
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:09,534
Oh, please, will.

271
00:10:09,534 --> 00:10:12,234
It's a public school.

272
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,300
Isn't this going to be great?

273
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:17,301
This means I am gonna be around
all the time now.

274
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:26,434
"know your routes."

275
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,850
Now that is the key
to this play, gentlemen.

276
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,483
The receivers run
the fly route downfield

277
00:10:32,483 --> 00:10:34,917
And then block
as the play develops, okay?

278
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:37,884
Know your assignments.
it's not...

279
00:10:37,884 --> 00:10:39,351
<i>finn:
i'm losing it.</i>

280
00:10:39,351 --> 00:10:41,483
<i>i'm tired all the time.</i>

281
00:10:41,483 --> 00:10:42,850
<i>i can't keep my eyes open.</i>

282
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,517
Ken (distant, echoing):
that's your only job

283
00:10:44,517 --> 00:10:46,351
Is to know your assignments.

284
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:47,750
Will:
no sharps and no flats.

285
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,583
<i>finn:
i know how lucky i am.</i>

286
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,251

00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,850
<i>i know i should be excited
about quinn.</i>

288
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,583
<i>she's hot, popular,</i>

289
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,917
<i>and she's carrying my baby

290
00:10:57,917 --> 00:10:59,951
<i>but i can't get rachel

291
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,284
<i>she kind of freaks me out
in a swimfan kind of way,</i>

292
00:11:02,284 --> 00:11:05,318

293
00:11:05,318 --> 00:11:07,517

294
00:11:07,517 --> 00:11:09,284
<i>my body's a mess.</i>

295
00:11:09,284 --> 00:11:11,318
<i>i found a hair on my ear
the other day,</i>

296
00:11:11,318 --> 00:11:13,617
<i>and i have to rub biofreeze
on my shins</i>

297
00:11:13,617 --> 00:11:15,984
<i>a couple times a day--
growing pains.</i>

298
00:11:15,984 --> 00:11:20,684
<i>it smells pretty bad, but
i mask it with drakkar noir.</i>

299
00:11:20,684 --> 00:11:23,251
<i>being a guy my age is tough.</i>

300
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:26,051
<i>between glee and football
and school and being popular,</i>

301
00:11:26,051 --> 00:11:27,550
<i>i'm just kind of overwhelmed.</i>

302
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,917
<i>everyone wants something
from me,</i>

303
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:31,284
<i>and i don't have the energy
to do it all.</i>

304
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:33,251
<i>i don't know how important
people like presidents</i>

305
00:11:33,251 --> 00:11:35,684
<i>or newscasters
or mob bosses do it.</i>

306
00:11:35,684 --> 00:11:38,450
<i>my mom says i'm stretched too
thin, so i gave up homework, </i>

307
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,151

308
00:11:40,151 --> 00:11:42,917
<i>all i know is last night
i got vaporized on level two.</i>

309
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:44,583
<i>level two.</i>

310
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,650
<i>and i didn't even
have the energy to care.</i>

311
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,917
(distant, echoing):
he's drooling.

312
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,650
(echoing):
dude, wake up.

313
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,784
(distant):
sure, yeah, that sounds good.

314
00:11:54,784 --> 00:11:56,750
I said we can't let
those girls beat us.

315
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,084
Sorry. sometimes
when i'm thinking real hard,

316
00:11:59,084 --> 00:12:01,351
It helps to close my eyes.

317
00:12:01,351 --> 00:12:02,483
We're doing a mash-up
of "it's my life"

318
00:12:02,483 --> 00:12:04,483
And usher's "confessions."

319
00:12:04,483 --> 00:12:06,051
Puck (echoes): we should
get some trash can lids

320
00:12:06,051 --> 00:12:07,251
<i>and stomp the yard up
in this piece.</i>

321
00:12:07,251 --> 00:12:08,650
Puck, with respect,

322
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,384
You're more helpful
when you don't contribute.

323
00:12:10,384 --> 00:12:11,583
Puck (echoes):
dude.

324
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:12,917
What's wrong
with you?

325
00:12:12,917 --> 00:12:14,184
Go see the nurse.

326
00:12:14,184 --> 00:12:15,717
Every day i say
i have a headache.

327
00:12:15,717 --> 00:12:16,884
I sleep for three hours.

328
00:12:16,884 --> 00:12:20,517
I haven't attended
a math class in two years.

329
00:12:20,517 --> 00:12:21,817
(sighs)

330
00:12:21,817 --> 00:12:23,650
Thanks, guys.

331
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,418
Keep up the good work.

332
00:12:26,418 --> 00:12:28,817
(bell ringing)

333
00:12:33,017 --> 00:12:35,450
Okay, girls, we need
to get started.

334
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,684
We're getting warmed up.

335
00:12:36,684 --> 00:12:39,051
Where's quinn?

336
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:41,817
Probably down at the mall
looking for elastic-waist pants.

337
00:12:41,817 --> 00:12:44,583
(girls giggle)

338
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:47,817
Mr. shuester's right, you guys.

339
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:49,318
We can't get complacent.

340
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:51,084
Chill out.
i already picked the songs.

341
00:12:51,084 --> 00:12:52,284
We're gonna do
a mash-up of "halo"

342
00:12:52,284 --> 00:12:53,284
And "walking on sunshine."

343
00:12:53,284 --> 00:12:55,117
That was my idea.

344
00:12:55,117 --> 00:12:56,318
Whatever.

345
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:58,418
Come on.
we can do this in our sleep.

346
00:12:58,418 --> 00:12:59,784
You think those six dudes

347
00:12:59,784 --> 00:13:01,217
Are gonna give us
any competition?

348
00:13:01,217 --> 00:13:02,750
I say we just
wing it.

349
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,617
We can't just wing it.

350
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,550
All those in favor
of winging it?

351
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,717
All those opposed?

352
00:13:10,117 --> 00:13:13,151
Looks like the ayes have it.

353
00:13:21,784 --> 00:13:23,084
Hi. how can i help you?

354
00:13:23,084 --> 00:13:25,318
Hey, mrs. shuester.
uh-huh.

355
00:13:25,318 --> 00:13:27,051
I'm finn hudson.
i'm in glee with your husband.

356
00:13:27,051 --> 00:13:29,351
Oh, hi, finn.
oh, wait a minute.

357
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:31,917
Are you the one
who's dating quinn fabray?

358
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:33,550
Yeah. why?

359
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,418
Oh, you have really good
bone structure.

360
00:13:35,418 --> 00:13:37,251
Yeah, um,

361
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:38,917
I've been really
tired lately,

362
00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:41,784
And i was wondering if i could
lie down in here for a while.

363
00:13:41,784 --> 00:13:43,384
Why don't you have a seat?

364
00:13:44,784 --> 00:13:46,884
Why don't you tell me
a little bit

365
00:13:46,884 --> 00:13:48,051
About your sleep habits?

366
00:13:48,051 --> 00:13:49,117
What time do you go to bed?

367
00:13:49,117 --> 00:13:50,583
Um, i don't know.

368
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:53,750
Usually, after skinemax starts
playing regular movies again.

369
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,450
And i'm normally tired,

370
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:58,550
But lately
i can't just fall asleep.

371
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,284
It's like my brain
won't shut up.

372
00:14:00,284 --> 00:14:01,418
Well, what are you
thinking about?

373
00:14:03,517 --> 00:14:05,351
Oh, you can be honest with me.

374
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:07,483
There's a code of silence
in my office.

375
00:14:07,483 --> 00:14:11,917
Okay, uh, football plays...

376
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,117
Uh-huh.

377
00:14:13,117 --> 00:14:14,984
...um, girls,

378
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:18,184
Dance steps... girls.

379
00:14:18,184 --> 00:14:20,917
Girls? but you're dating
quinn fabray.

380
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:22,617
Yeah, but...

381
00:14:25,051 --> 00:14:28,017
Do you think a guy can be
into two girls at once?

382
00:14:28,017 --> 00:14:29,517
No.

383
00:14:29,517 --> 00:14:31,051
And remember,
flirting is cheating.

384
00:14:31,051 --> 00:14:34,784
And the revenge of the jilted
woman is usually pretty messy.

385
00:14:34,784 --> 00:14:36,450
So can i take my nap now?

386
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,284
Do you want to sleep
through your life, finn?

387
00:14:38,284 --> 00:14:40,318
No, but i read once

388
00:14:40,318 --> 00:14:42,384
That teenagers need more sleep
than infants.

389
00:14:42,384 --> 00:14:43,884
When i was in high school,

390
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:46,917
I captained the cheerleading
squad, i kept a perfect 4.0 gpa,

391
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:48,384
I cultivated my popularity,

392
00:14:48,384 --> 00:14:50,717
And i maintained
a loving relationship

393
00:14:50,717 --> 00:14:53,117
With the boy who would
become my husband.

394
00:14:53,117 --> 00:14:55,251
Wow.

395
00:14:55,251 --> 00:14:58,251
I don't even know
how i did that.

396
00:14:58,251 --> 00:15:01,517
Wait a minute.
yes, i do.

397
00:15:03,184 --> 00:15:05,184
Pseudoephedrine.

398
00:15:05,184 --> 00:15:06,650
It's the stuff
they put in decongestants

399
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,951
To make them non-drowsy.

400
00:15:07,951 --> 00:15:10,318
It's kind of like a...
well, like a vitamin.

401
00:15:10,318 --> 00:15:13,884
I would pop two of these
blue meanies every morning

402
00:15:13,884 --> 00:15:15,550
And then i would be
a firecracker

403
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,884
For the rest of the day.

404
00:15:16,884 --> 00:15:18,650
Are they safe?
they're over-
the-counter.

405
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,418
They stock them next
to the candy bars.

406
00:15:21,418 --> 00:15:23,884
Sweetie, i'm the
school nurse.

407
00:15:23,884 --> 00:15:25,384
I know what i'm doing.

408
00:15:31,151 --> 00:15:33,017
Hey, guys, how's it going?

409
00:15:33,017 --> 00:15:34,617
(inhales)
god, it's a beautiful day.

410
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:35,684
Let's run through the number.

411
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,184
I can't wait
to do the number.

412
00:15:37,184 --> 00:15:38,418
I'm ready
and excited.

413
00:15:38,418 --> 00:15:39,684
Are you guys?
stand up. come on.

414
00:15:39,684 --> 00:15:41,284
Let's get this
joint jumping.

415
00:15:41,284 --> 00:15:43,951
Has your soul been taken over
by caffeinated space aliens?

416
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:45,984
No, just visited
the school nurse.

417
00:15:45,984 --> 00:15:48,151
Got this great vitamin.
i feel fantastic.

418
00:15:48,151 --> 00:15:49,550
I can't wait to do the number.

419
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,217
Let's do the number,
and then afterwards,

420
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:53,151
We can build a house for
habitat for humanity.

421
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:54,318
What kind of vitamin?

422
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:55,583
Vitamin c?

423
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,384
<i>vogue magazine says
it boosts energy levels</i>

424
00:15:57,384 --> 00:15:58,550
And brightens the
complexion.

425
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,351
Vitamin d.

426
00:16:00,351 --> 00:16:01,650
And i got you guys some.

Awesome, guys.

462
00:17:58,017 --> 00:17:59,450
Geez, i didn't know
you had it in you.

463
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,984
It's like somebody slipped
something in your juice boxes.

464
00:18:01,984 --> 00:18:03,483
Whoo!

465
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:04,784
You ladies better
bring it tomorrow.

466
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06,817
Otherwise,

467
00:18:06,817 --> 00:18:09,251
We've got our opening number
for sectionals!

468
00:18:09,251 --> 00:18:10,884
(boys cheering)

469
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:30,034
Haven't seen you
at glee rehearsals.

470
00:18:30,034 --> 00:18:32,468
I'm not superwoman.

471
00:18:32,468 --> 00:18:34,234
I know glee is your whole life,

472
00:18:34,234 --> 00:18:36,201
But i have the cheerios,

473
00:18:36,201 --> 00:18:38,568
I'm on honor roll,
i have friends.

474
00:18:38,568 --> 00:18:41,334
You don't have to
be embarrassed.

475
00:18:41,334 --> 00:18:43,733
No one at glee is
gonna judge you.

476
00:18:46,534 --> 00:18:48,867
Look, i know everyone
expects us to be enemies

477
00:18:48,867 --> 00:18:52,468
And be in competition,
but i don't hate you.

478
00:18:52,468 --> 00:18:56,234
Why not?
i've been awful to you.

479
00:18:56,234 --> 00:18:59,334
That was before you knew
what it felt like to be me;

480
00:18:59,334 --> 00:19:00,700
An outsider.

481
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:03,967
More people are gonna start
finding out about this,

482
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:05,633
And you're gonna need friends
who can relate.

483
00:19:05,633 --> 00:19:07,733
How can you relate
to what i'm going through?

484
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:09,800
You don't think people
whisper about me

485
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,367
In the lunchrooms
or draw pornographic pictures

486
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:12,867
Of me on the bathroom walls?

487
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:15,134
That was me,

488
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:17,134
Actually.

489
00:19:17,134 --> 00:19:20,167
Look, i don't agree
with the choice you're making,

490
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:21,667
But you're gonna need glee.

491
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:24,434
You have seven months
of your youth left.

492
00:19:24,434 --> 00:19:25,834
You should enjoy it.

493
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:27,568
And let's face it,
in a couple of months,

494
00:19:27,568 --> 00:19:28,934
That cheerleading uniform
isn't gonna fit

495
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,101
And we're gonna be
all you have left.

496
00:19:31,101 --> 00:19:34,134
Just come back to practice.

497
00:19:34,134 --> 00:19:35,867
Boys versus girls.
it's fun.

498
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:37,934
And we could certainly use
your voice right now.

499
00:19:37,934 --> 00:19:39,334
You're actually a
good singer, quinn.

500
00:19:39,334 --> 00:19:41,733
Occasionally sharp,
but that's just because

501
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:44,267
You lack my years
of training.

502
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:46,568
I would have tortured you

503
00:19:46,568 --> 00:19:48,900
If the roles were reversed,
you know?

504
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,468
I know.

505
00:19:58,934 --> 00:20:00,934
(phone line ringing)

506
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:03,101
Hi. it's terri.

507
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:05,667
Hi, terri.
this is howard bamboo.

508
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:07,967
Yeah, i know that, howard.

509
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:10,568
Okay, you know how
i'm moonlighting as a nurse?

510
00:20:10,568 --> 00:20:11,967
Well, i need a favor.

511
00:20:11,967 --> 00:20:13,501
O-okay.

512
00:20:13,501 --> 00:20:15,267
Go to the drugstore
and get me a couple of boxes

513
00:20:15,267 --> 00:20:16,867
Of decongestant.

514
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:18,667
I'm running low, and i want
the children at mckinley

515
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:20,134
To be healthy and happy.

516
00:20:20,134 --> 00:20:22,301
Uh, h-how many boxes?

517
00:20:22,301 --> 00:20:23,334
Um...

518
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:25,167
Thirty-six.

519
00:20:26,468 --> 00:20:27,834
(groans)

520
00:20:30,301 --> 00:20:32,401
(whimpers)

521
00:20:32,401 --> 00:20:33,700
Hey, terri.

522
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,134
Oh, hi, ken.
what's up?

523
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:42,633
Can we talk frank?

524
00:20:42,633 --> 00:20:44,834
Uh...

525
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:47,401
Listen...

526
00:20:47,401 --> 00:20:49,401
We have a problem.

527
00:20:49,401 --> 00:20:51,367
I think my girlfriend
is in love with your husband.

528
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:53,501
And i wouldn't be surprised
if the feeling was mutual.

529
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:55,367
How long has this
been going on?

530
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:56,733
I don't know.
a couple months.

531
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:59,101
I see them together all the time
laughing, talking...

532
00:20:59,101 --> 00:21:00,667
All the stuff
she never does with me.

533
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:02,301
You know, i knew
something was up.

534
00:21:02,301 --> 00:21:04,167
She couldn't keep
her eyes off him

535
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:05,733
At those acafella
clown shows.

536
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:09,234
Listen, has will
ever mentioned it to you?

537
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:10,667
Oh, no,
but he's too smart for that.

538
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:12,934
I mean, just barely, but still.

539
00:21:12,934 --> 00:21:14,900
Oh, ken,
i got to be honest with you.

540
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,434
I only took
this job

541
00:21:16,434 --> 00:21:18,367
So that i could
keep an eye on him.

542
00:21:18,367 --> 00:21:22,468
We've got to put a stop to this
so that i can get out of here.

543
00:21:22,468 --> 00:21:25,167
See, i'm not built to work
five days a week.

544
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:26,600
Well, i've been thinking

545
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,434
Maybe that if you and i started
seeing each other on the side,

546
00:21:29,434 --> 00:21:31,201
It might kind of cancel
their thing out.

547
00:21:32,967 --> 00:21:34,667
Are you two still having sex?

548
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:37,501
Because, you know, when that
stops, something is up.

549
00:21:37,501 --> 00:21:41,000
We actually haven't,
um... had sex yet.

550
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,600
She doesn't like
to be touched.

551
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,600
By me.

552
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,568
Oh.

553
00:21:47,568 --> 00:21:51,600
God, i love her so much.

554
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,067
Oh, uh...

555
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:55,334
Okay.

556
00:21:55,334 --> 00:21:56,501
(crying softly)

557
00:21:56,501 --> 00:21:59,267
It's okay.

558
00:21:59,267 --> 00:22:01,234
There, there.

559
00:22:01,234 --> 00:22:02,633
Look at the two of us.

560
00:22:02,633 --> 00:22:04,101
(laughs)

561
00:22:04,101 --> 00:22:06,667
You pregnant, and
me with psoriasis
oh.

562
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:08,733
And one testicle
that won't descend.

563
00:22:08,733 --> 00:22:11,267
I don't know who to
feel more sorry for.

564
00:22:11,267 --> 00:22:12,434
Okay, that's enough.

565
00:22:12,434 --> 00:22:14,934
You know what? you got
to stop being such a baby.

566
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:16,667
I cannot fix this unless
you are willing to man up.

567
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:18,201
Okay. i'm sorry.

568
00:22:18,201 --> 00:22:20,201
(sighs)

569
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:23,534
(gasps) here's what
you're going to do.

570
00:22:23,534 --> 00:22:25,633
You're going straight to
the nearest department store

571
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:27,434
To buy her an engagement ring.

572
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,667
Then you're going
to get down on one knee

573
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:32,534
And you're going to ask
that doe-eyed little harlot

574
00:22:32,534 --> 00:22:33,867
To marry you.

575
00:22:33,867 --> 00:22:37,401
No. i can't do that.

576
00:22:37,401 --> 00:22:38,800
What if she says no?

577
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,967
It might kill me.

578
00:22:44,267 --> 00:22:45,501
Take two of these.

579
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:48,334
Then nothing can stop you.

580
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,034
I told you guys.

581
00:22:53,034 --> 00:22:54,501
We know.

582
00:22:54,501 --> 00:22:57,234
You've been berating us for
the better part of an hour.

583
00:22:57,234 --> 00:22:58,900
Were they really that good?

584
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,800
They were, quinn.
look, i was fine with arranging,

585
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,633
Choreographing and directing
this number free of charge.

586
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:05,534
But we underestimated the boys.

587
00:23:05,534 --> 00:23:06,900
Their number will go to
sectionals and once again,

588
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,401
I will be humiliated.

589
00:23:08,401 --> 00:23:10,367
How were we supposed to know
they'd rock the house?

590
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:11,934
They've never been good.

591
00:23:11,934 --> 00:23:13,367
How did they d-d-do it?

592
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:15,534
The real question is,
"what were they on?"

593
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,167
Though i've been
grouped with the boys,

594
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:20,201
My allegiance still remains
with you ladies.

595
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:22,401
They declined my offer
to do their hair in cornrows

596
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,267
And all my artistic decisions
have been derided as too costly

597
00:23:25,267 --> 00:23:26,733
Because they involve
several varieties

598
00:23:26,733 --> 00:23:27,900
Of exotic bird feathers.

599
00:23:29,901 --> 00:23:30,901
♪♪♪

600
00:23:53,401 --> 00:23:56,334
My man, got next week's
plays all worked out.

601
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,468
Yeah. hey, mr. shue,
got that paper

602
00:23:58,468 --> 00:23:59,734
On bariloche,
argentina on your desk.

603
00:23:59,734 --> 00:24:00,934
But it's not due
for two weeks.

604
00:24:00,934 --> 00:24:02,934
Damn straight.
i am in the zone.

605
00:24:02,934 --> 00:24:04,401
Cheater.

606
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,201
I don't know what
you're talking about.

607
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:07,800
You took performance enhancers
before your mash-up.

608
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,001
Kurt told me.

609
00:24:09,001 --> 00:24:11,834
It's deplorable,
contemptible,

610
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:12,934
And it's just plain wrong.

611
00:24:12,934 --> 00:24:14,567
It's also cheating.
as a matter of fact,

612
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:16,167
I'm going to start
calling you f-rod.

613
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:18,101
Hey, hey, back off. i'm
nothing like a-rod, okay?

614
00:24:18,101 --> 00:24:19,301
I'd never take steroids.

615
00:24:19,301 --> 00:24:20,800
They make your junk fall off.

616
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,201
Listen, rachel, you don't
know what it's like for me,

617
00:24:23,201 --> 00:24:24,500
The kind of
pressure i'm under.

618
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,934
Oh, we all have pressures,
but you know how i deal with it?

619
00:24:26,934 --> 00:24:30,434
The natural way, with a rigorous
diet and exercise routine.

620
00:24:30,434 --> 00:24:31,734
(beeping)

621
00:24:31,734 --> 00:24:33,234
("ain't nothing gonna
hold me down" playing)

622
00:24:33,234 --> 00:24:35,767
<i>rachel:
i'm up at 6:00 a.m. every day.</i>

623
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:39,067
<i>i have my protein shake
with banana and flaxseed oil,</i>

624
00:24:39,067 --> 00:24:42,101
<i>and by 6:10,
i'm on the elliptical.</i>

625
00:24:42,101 --> 00:24:44,134
<i>you know how i motivate myself?</i>

626
00:24:44,134 --> 00:24:45,368
<i>not with anything artificial.</i>

627
00:24:45,368 --> 00:24:46,867
<i>i set a goal</i>

628
00:24:46,867 --> 00:24:49,667
<i>and i won't rest
until i reach it.</i>

629
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:51,633
Yeah, well, that's
personal pressure.

630
00:24:51,633 --> 00:24:53,401
If you don't meet your goal,
you're the only one who loses.

631
00:24:53,401 --> 00:24:55,767
I have to be the quarterback,
the male lead, and deal with

632
00:24:55,767 --> 00:24:57,434
A pregnant girlfriend who
yells at me about ice cream,

633
00:24:57,434 --> 00:25:00,334
So, yeah, maybe i helped me and
my teammates out a little bit,

634
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:01,900
But it's only because
i'm sick and tired

635
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,034
Of working so hard
and still losing.

636
00:25:04,034 --> 00:25:05,767
Yeah, but winning
by cheating isn't winning.

637
00:25:05,767 --> 00:25:06,934
Oh, don't give me that.

638
00:25:06,934 --> 00:25:08,767
The only reason you're
so pissed about this

639
00:25:08,767 --> 00:25:10,001
Is 'cause you know you
can't compete with us.

640
00:25:10,001 --> 00:25:11,934
Oh, i am offended
by that accusation.

641
00:25:11,934 --> 00:25:13,734
We haven't performed yet,
but if i may say,

642
00:25:13,734 --> 00:25:15,533
Our mash-up is spectacular.

643
00:25:15,533 --> 00:25:17,134
Still isn't going to be as good.

644
00:25:17,134 --> 00:25:19,101
We're gonna win.
you're gonna lose.

645
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:20,767
Deal with it.

646
00:25:25,368 --> 00:25:27,667
Everyone gets a dose.

647
00:25:27,667 --> 00:25:30,067
Oh, except for quinn.
you get folic acid.

648
00:25:30,067 --> 00:25:31,633
Mama.

649
00:25:31,633 --> 00:25:33,334
(quietly):
it's good for the baby.

650
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,401
Get the lead out, howard.

651
00:25:37,401 --> 00:25:38,934
We have patients waiting.

652
00:25:40,301 --> 00:25:43,067
Are you sure
we should be doing this?

653
00:25:43,067 --> 00:25:45,533
Oh, it's over-the-
counter. it's safe.

654
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:47,034
You can trust me.

655
00:25:47,034 --> 00:25:48,600
I'm a nurse.

656
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,567
It's good for you.

657
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:03,468
(whirring, buzzing)

658
00:26:03,468 --> 00:26:04,667
What's up with ken?

659
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:06,468
Doesn't he have
a healthy glow?

660
00:26:06,468 --> 00:26:08,334
I put him on a new
vitamin regimen.

661
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:10,167
Is that safe?

662
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:11,667
I mean, you're not
really a nurse, terri.

663
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:13,401
Don't start criticizing
my work, will.

664
00:26:13,401 --> 00:26:15,900
Not when i'm just
getting my sea legs.

665
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,667
(sighs)

666
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:23,633
Isn't this nice?

667
00:26:23,633 --> 00:26:25,001
I mean, when is the last time

668
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:27,667
We got to have lunch
together on a weekday?
hmm.

669
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:30,401
Oh, honey, you have
a little mustard.

670
00:26:30,401 --> 00:26:33,101
Just...

671
00:26:33,101 --> 00:26:35,234
Geez, terri.

672
00:26:35,234 --> 00:26:37,600
This is my workplace.
i'm sorry, honey.

673
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,301
It's just that my hormones are
going really crazy for you.

674
00:26:40,301 --> 00:26:41,700
Hey, look, look.

675
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,567
You being here is not good
for our marriage.

676
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:48,700
Spending time together
is not good for our marriage?

677
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,434
Not every minute.

678
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:52,167
There's no separation.

679
00:26:52,167 --> 00:26:53,500
I mean, we used
to come home every night

680
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,001
And talk about our day.

681
00:26:55,001 --> 00:26:57,967
Now we have nothing
to say to each other.

682
00:26:57,967 --> 00:27:01,368
A lot of ants on
the sidewalk today.

683
00:27:06,267 --> 00:27:08,267
Pretty late
in the season for that.

684
00:27:09,867 --> 00:27:12,034
I think this is
just forcing us

685
00:27:12,034 --> 00:27:13,301
To expand our
intellectual horizons.

686
00:27:13,301 --> 00:27:14,767
(sighs)

687
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:16,368
Where are you going?
the bathroom.

688
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:18,734
I'll come with you.
no!

689
00:27:18,734 --> 00:27:21,867
I love you,
but i need my space.

690
00:27:26,001 --> 00:27:28,001
Mmm.

691
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,800
Now's your
chance, ken.

692
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,967
What, here? now?
yeah.

693
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,500
Hi, emma.
hi, ken.

694
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:43,301
What are you doing?

695
00:27:43,301 --> 00:27:44,700
Look, emma,
i know our relationship

696
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,368
Hasn't been perfect--
you won't ride in my car,

697
00:27:46,368 --> 00:27:48,101
I can't touch you
above the wrist.

698
00:27:48,101 --> 00:27:50,167
Remember, you cried for an hour
that one time my elbow

699
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:51,967
Accidentally brushed
by your breast?

700
00:27:51,967 --> 00:27:53,700
But i think about you
all day long.

701
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,101
I kiss that picture of us
at the state fair every night

702
00:27:56,101 --> 00:27:57,567
Before i go to sleep.

703
00:27:59,101 --> 00:28:00,368
Oh, my god. oh, my god.
oh, my god.

704
00:28:00,368 --> 00:28:01,700
This isn't happening.
this is a dream.

705
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,533
Emma pillsbury,
this is not an engagement ring.

706
00:28:04,533 --> 00:28:05,967
Oh, thank goodness.
no, i mean it is.

707
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:08,834
But it's more than
that. it's a promise.

708
00:28:08,834 --> 00:28:12,567
Look, emma, i know you have
this thing about being clean.

709
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:14,533
Now, i can't promise
to pick up my underwear

710
00:28:14,533 --> 00:28:16,700
Or squeegee the
shower door,

711
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,800
But i can promise to keep
your life clean of sadness

712
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,334
And loneliness

713
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:24,167
And any other dark clouds
that might float into it.

714
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:29,500
It's cubic zirconia.

715
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,533
<i>i know how affected you were
by black diamond.</i>

716
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:36,301
Emma pillsbury, eminem...

717
00:28:36,301 --> 00:28:38,034
Will you marry me?

718
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:41,301
(sighs)

719
00:28:43,101 --> 00:28:44,667
Thank you so much.
it really is a pleasure.

720
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:46,034
While the boys chose a selection
of songs that cast

721
00:28:46,034 --> 00:28:47,467
An eye inward on
the irresponsible

722
00:28:47,467 --> 00:28:49,400
Life choices and sexual hunger
of today's modern teens,

723
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,268
We have chosen a selection
of songs that speaks

724
00:28:51,268 --> 00:28:53,500
To the nation as a whole
during these troubling times

725
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,101
Filled with economic uncertainty
and unbridled social woe.

726
00:28:55,101 --> 00:28:57,334
Because if there's two things
america needs right now,

727
00:28:57,334 --> 00:28:59,234
That is sunshine and optimism.

728
00:29:00,467 --> 00:29:02,334
Also angels.

729
00:29:02,334 --> 00:29:04,334
(gasping for air)

730
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,067
Okay.

Ladies, i-i don't even know
what to say.

771
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,201
You did
such a good job.

772
00:30:55,201 --> 00:30:56,467
I don't know what
you guys did,

773
00:30:56,467 --> 00:30:58,101
But whatever it
was, keep doing it.

Hey, great
job, guys.

777
00:31:05,467 --> 00:31:07,034
Okay! all right.

778
00:31:07,034 --> 00:31:10,467
Whoo!

779
00:31:10,467 --> 00:31:12,500
Ha!

780
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,467
Hey, emma, um...

781
00:31:14,467 --> 00:31:15,867
Can you walk with me?

782
00:31:15,867 --> 00:31:17,567
Yeah.

783
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,034
I think your, uh... i
think your plan worked.

784
00:31:22,034 --> 00:31:23,834
Yeah.
(both laughing)

785
00:31:23,834 --> 00:31:25,767
Instilling a sense of
good, clean competition

786
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:27,533
In these kids,
i think, um...

787
00:31:27,533 --> 00:31:29,101
I think you really
motivated them.

788
00:31:29,101 --> 00:31:31,867
Well, actually, i consider
you a co-conspirator.

789
00:31:31,867 --> 00:31:34,533
We came up with
the idea together.

790
00:31:34,533 --> 00:31:36,800
So...

791
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,600
Is it true about ken
asking to marry you?

792
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,967
Yeah.

793
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:43,134
Yeah, it is.

794
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,001
What are you going to do?

795
00:31:47,001 --> 00:31:49,767
I don't know.

796
00:31:49,767 --> 00:31:52,067
Can you, um...

797
00:31:52,067 --> 00:31:54,934
Can you think of any other
options i might have?

798
00:31:54,934 --> 00:31:56,934
(sighs)

799
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,433
Is... is that a reason
to marry someone?

800
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:04,901
That's not what i'm asking.

801
00:32:11,001 --> 00:32:13,001
(bell ringing)

802
00:32:13,001 --> 00:32:15,001
(footfalls approaching)

803
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:18,700
Emma.

804
00:32:19,734 --> 00:32:21,767
Terri.

805
00:32:21,767 --> 00:32:23,800
Um, how are you?

806
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,634
What can i, uh...

807
00:32:25,634 --> 00:32:28,067
What can i...

808
00:32:28,067 --> 00:32:29,234
Do for you?

809
00:32:29,234 --> 00:32:31,500
I just wanted
to cut to the chase.

810
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,001
Things have been
a little awkward since

811
00:32:33,001 --> 00:32:35,334
I started working here.
i just wanted to clear the air.

812
00:32:35,334 --> 00:32:38,400
Oh. that's, um...

813
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,867
That's actually really nice.
why don't you just...

814
00:32:40,867 --> 00:32:43,034
You have no chance
with my husband.

815
00:32:43,034 --> 00:32:44,134
Do i make myself clear?

816
00:32:44,134 --> 00:32:45,867
Oh, you might think
there's some kind

817
00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:47,634
Of competition going on
between you and i,

818
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:48,834
But that's like saying

819
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,800
That a nail is competing
with a hammer.

820
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:55,268
Terri, will is a good man.

821
00:32:55,268 --> 00:32:56,301
Uh-huh.

822
00:32:56,301 --> 00:33:00,667
He's kind and he's generous...

823
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:02,967
And he deserves a lot better
than you.

824
00:33:02,967 --> 00:33:06,600
Emma, will is my husband.

825
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:09,967
Look at you.

826
00:33:09,967 --> 00:33:12,500
You are so superior
because you're nice to a man

827
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,067
That you see
for an hour or two a day.

828
00:33:14,067 --> 00:33:16,034
You're just an innocent

829
00:33:16,034 --> 00:33:18,467
Little dove. hmm?

830
00:33:18,467 --> 00:33:21,201
You're so innocent
that you would steal a man away

831
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:23,134
From his pregnant wife.

832
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:24,334
Yeah.

833
00:33:24,334 --> 00:33:26,167
Do yourself a favor, honey.

834
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:27,834
Marry ken tanaka.

835
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:30,268
Oh, sure, he's dumb like sand,

836
00:33:30,268 --> 00:33:31,901
And his fondue pot
of nationalities

837
00:33:31,901 --> 00:33:34,867
Is gonna open your kids up
to a host of genetic diseases,

838
00:33:34,867 --> 00:33:38,400
But he's kind
and he's generous.

839
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,101
And he's available.

840
00:33:57,267 --> 00:33:58,367
Mrs. schuester.

841
00:33:58,367 --> 00:33:59,567
Mm-hmm?

842
00:33:59,567 --> 00:34:01,367
I need to talk
to you...

843
00:34:01,367 --> 00:34:02,567
About the baby.

844
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:03,801
Is everything okay?

845
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:05,933
Wait, you're not having it
right now, are you?

846
00:34:05,933 --> 00:34:07,033
What? no!

847
00:34:07,033 --> 00:34:08,734
Aren't you supposed
to be a nurse?

848
00:34:08,734 --> 00:34:09,768
Mm-hmm.

849
00:34:13,501 --> 00:34:15,267
I've been thinking
about your offer.

850
00:34:15,267 --> 00:34:16,801
Yeah?

851
00:34:16,801 --> 00:34:19,367
I like my life.

852
00:34:19,367 --> 00:34:22,401
I like being a cheerleader.

853
00:34:22,401 --> 00:34:25,367
And i can't believe
i'm actually saying this,

854
00:34:25,367 --> 00:34:28,067
But i really like
being in glee club.

855
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:30,834
I have all of these great things
in my life,

856
00:34:30,834 --> 00:34:35,000
And it already feels like
too much.

857
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,501
(whispers):
i can't raise a baby.

858
00:34:40,967 --> 00:34:42,933
You know, honestly,
i don't even know how

859
00:34:42,933 --> 00:34:44,501
You kids do it nowadays.

860
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:46,701
I didn't have it this bad

861
00:34:46,701 --> 00:34:48,100
When i was your age.

862
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,434
There weren't as many
tv channels either, though.

863
00:34:51,734 --> 00:34:53,234
Is finn okay with this?

864
00:34:53,234 --> 00:34:55,267
'cause, you know, i don't want
any baby daddy drama

865
00:34:55,267 --> 00:34:56,701
When you hand it over to me.

866
00:34:56,701 --> 00:35:00,000
He's the reason i'm doing this.

867
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,933
He's such a good guy,

868
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,601
And he internalizes
all this pressure.

869
00:35:04,601 --> 00:35:06,000
He's gonna have a heart attack.

870
00:35:07,467 --> 00:35:11,167
I never want mr. schuester
to find out about this, though.

871
00:35:11,167 --> 00:35:13,167
I don't want to hurt him,
either.

872
00:35:13,167 --> 00:35:15,501
Well,
your secret's safe with me.

873
00:35:15,501 --> 00:35:17,801
I have a lot more to lose.

874
00:35:17,801 --> 00:35:20,200
One more thing.

875
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,300
You know how you gave me
those vitamins for the baby?

876
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,334
Mm-hmm.

877
00:35:24,334 --> 00:35:26,067
I really appreciated that,

878
00:35:26,067 --> 00:35:30,000
But i'm gonna have
all these doctor's bills,

879
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,801
And i'm gonna need
some new maternity clothes.

880
00:35:31,801 --> 00:35:33,367
You want money from me?

881
00:35:33,367 --> 00:35:35,367
<i>it's gonna be your baby.</i>

882
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:37,501
Which means i'm gonna be
paying the bills for 18 years.

883
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:39,334
I think you can handle
nine months.

884
00:35:39,334 --> 00:35:42,367
Look, you're making
the right call here, quinn.

885
00:35:42,367 --> 00:35:44,300
It's what's best for everybody.

886
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:54,667
(sighs)

887
00:35:54,667 --> 00:35:56,033
(gasps softly)

888
00:35:59,167 --> 00:36:00,967
Hi.

889
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,933
Hi.

890
00:36:06,933 --> 00:36:10,334
Um, i can't... i can't stay long
in this room

891
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,801
Because of the germs,
you know,

892
00:36:11,801 --> 00:36:13,367
And because of the odor.

893
00:36:15,134 --> 00:36:17,367
But i have a question.

894
00:36:17,367 --> 00:36:20,534
Anything for you, emma.

895
00:36:22,467 --> 00:36:25,200
So what would, um...

896
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,100
What would getting married mean

897
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,200
Exactly?

898
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,933
Because i would want to keep
my last name.

899
00:36:32,933 --> 00:36:37,067
And i'd want to continue living
in different parts of town,

900
00:36:37,067 --> 00:36:39,734
And, um,
i think it would be best

901
00:36:39,734 --> 00:36:41,634
If we didn't see each other
after school.

902
00:36:41,634 --> 00:36:43,734
Sure.

903
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,267
And i wouldn't want
a big ceremony, you know,

904
00:36:45,267 --> 00:36:48,434
Like in a church with people.

905
00:36:48,434 --> 00:36:50,200
We wouldn't have to invite
anybody, you know,

906
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,567
Or tell anybody, actually.

907
00:36:51,567 --> 00:36:53,033
It could be more like
a secret, you know,

908
00:36:53,033 --> 00:36:54,467
Like a secret marriage.

909
00:36:54,467 --> 00:36:57,467
That's actually a better deal
than i expected.

910
00:36:58,501 --> 00:37:01,367
You're a really good man, ken.

911
00:37:02,401 --> 00:37:04,900
And i don't want
to spend

912
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,834
The rest
of my life alone,

913
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:10,834
And i know that
you don't either.

914
00:37:14,634 --> 00:37:18,033
So...

915
00:37:18,033 --> 00:37:19,601
Is that a yes?

916
00:37:25,267 --> 00:37:27,200
What's up, a-rage?

917
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,033
Hey, sweet mash-up.
you guys were so energetic.

918
00:37:30,033 --> 00:37:33,868
We were just taking a lesson
from major league baseball.

919
00:37:33,868 --> 00:37:35,501
It's not cheating
if everyone's doing it.

920
00:37:35,501 --> 00:37:37,267
We were just leveling out
the playing field.

921
00:37:37,267 --> 00:37:38,933
You really believe that?

922
00:37:41,267 --> 00:37:42,634
No.

923
00:37:42,634 --> 00:37:44,200
I feel terrible.

924
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,801
Even if we win,
it's not gonna be satisfying.

925
00:37:46,801 --> 00:37:47,933
I know.

926
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:49,967
I don't even remember
performing.

927
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:51,634
What do you think
we should do?

928
00:37:51,634 --> 00:37:55,501
I think... the only way
to make things right

929
00:37:55,501 --> 00:37:57,501
Is to just withdraw
from the competition.

930
00:37:57,501 --> 00:37:59,033
You know,
admit that we were wrong

931
00:37:59,033 --> 00:38:01,801
And disqualify our
respective teams immediately.

932
00:38:01,801 --> 00:38:02,967
No one gets to win.

933
00:38:02,967 --> 00:38:05,434
Cool.

934
00:38:08,701 --> 00:38:10,601
I'm sorry about
what i said the other day.

935
00:38:10,601 --> 00:38:13,267
About calling you
contemptible and deplorable.

936
00:38:13,267 --> 00:38:14,534
Ah, that's all right.

937
00:38:14,534 --> 00:38:16,734
I didn't even know
what those words meant.

938
00:38:16,734 --> 00:38:19,768
What i meant
to say is that

939
00:38:19,768 --> 00:38:22,967
I guess i get caught up in
the competitive hysteria, too.

940
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,100
My goals are too selfish.

941
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,501
You know, it's time for me to
stop competing against everyone

942
00:38:28,501 --> 00:38:30,434
And start competing
alongside them.

943
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:32,134
(bell ringing)

944
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:41,067
What the hell
were you thinking?

945
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:43,033
You gave drugs
to my students?

946
00:38:43,033 --> 00:38:44,601
I'll say it again.

947
00:38:44,601 --> 00:38:46,434
They're over-the-counter,
fda-approved.

948
00:38:46,434 --> 00:38:48,467
And if i didn't give it to them,
i'm sure the kids

949
00:38:48,467 --> 00:38:50,167
Would just find a way
to get it for themselves.

950
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:51,434
No, no, they wouldn't.

951
00:38:51,434 --> 00:38:52,434
These are good kids.

952
00:38:52,434 --> 00:38:54,000
Nothing bad happened.

953
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,967
Howard bamboo got arrested.

954
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,100
Well, that.

955
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,801
Wait. what?

956
00:39:01,801 --> 00:39:03,334
Pseudoephedrine
is an ingredient

957
00:39:03,334 --> 00:39:05,267
In the manufacturing
of methamphetamines.

958
00:39:05,267 --> 00:39:06,868
Howard got picked up

959
00:39:06,868 --> 00:39:09,601
By the feds on suspicion of
running a crystal meth lab.

960
00:39:09,601 --> 00:39:12,267
I never told howard
to get them all in one place.

961
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:14,134
Okay, enough, terri.

962
00:39:14,134 --> 00:39:16,067
How are we supposed
to raise a baby

963
00:39:16,067 --> 00:39:18,234
When i can't trust you
to look after

964
00:39:18,234 --> 00:39:19,768
A group of teenagers?

965
00:39:19,768 --> 00:39:21,768
You are oblivious
to consequences.

966
00:39:21,768 --> 00:39:23,567
I was only trying
to help you, will.

967
00:39:23,567 --> 00:39:24,667
Don't!

968
00:39:26,401 --> 00:39:29,267
Every time i light
a fire in my life,

969
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:33,701
You find a way to make sure
it burns the forest down.

970
00:39:35,734 --> 00:39:37,634
Figgins:
i have serious concerns

971
00:39:37,634 --> 00:39:39,234
About your judgment,
mrs. schuester.

972
00:39:39,234 --> 00:39:41,900
I must ask you to
resign as school nurse.

973
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,267
Fine.

974
00:39:44,267 --> 00:39:46,868
I was working too hard anyway.

975
00:39:48,768 --> 00:39:50,167
Hold onto your horses, shue.

976
00:39:50,167 --> 00:39:53,434
I have to question your
judgment in the matter as well.

977
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:55,900
What? i had no idea
this was even going on.

978
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,300
Exactly.

979
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,501
The children rely on you
to create the culture.

980
00:40:00,501 --> 00:40:03,401
And you, with your
obsession with winning

981
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,834
And-and competition,
has fostered

982
00:40:05,834 --> 00:40:07,501
An unsafe
environment.

983
00:40:07,501 --> 00:40:11,701
I'm bringing in someone else
to co-chair the glee club.

984
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:15,933
Someone with a track record of
responsibility and excellence.

985
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,434
We're really sorry, mr. shue.

986
00:40:20,434 --> 00:40:22,434
We didn't mean to get
you into trouble.

987
00:40:22,434 --> 00:40:27,267
I'm really disappointed
in you guys.

988
00:40:27,267 --> 00:40:29,701
Glee is supposed to be about
what's inside your heart,

989
00:40:29,701 --> 00:40:31,200
Not what's coursing
through your veins.

990
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,000
We know. and i think i speak
for everyone when i say

991
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,567
That we'd be happy
to move forward

992
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:36,967
And put this
episode behind us.

993
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:39,267
Well, it's not that simple.

994
00:40:39,267 --> 00:40:41,834
Because of this debacle,
it's been decided

995
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:44,167
That i'm no longer fit
to run glee club myself.

996
00:40:44,167 --> 00:40:46,501
We've been assigned

997
00:40:46,501 --> 00:40:47,900
A co-director.

998
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,868
Who?

999
00:40:49,868 --> 00:40:51,033
Hey, kids.

1000
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:53,033
(chuckles)
i got to tell you,

1001
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,868
I'm just thrilled to
be coming on board

1002
00:40:55,868 --> 00:41:00,267
To co-captain your little,
uh, showbiz cruise.

1003
00:41:00,267 --> 00:41:02,300
Ah, i can't wait to start
singing and dancing

1004
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,601
And maybe even putting on
the ritz a little bit.

1005
00:41:09,933 --> 00:41:12,634
Will?

1006
00:41:19,501 --> 00:41:22,300
I wanted you to, um,
to hear this from me.

1007
00:41:23,667 --> 00:41:27,534
You know ken, um,
asked me to marry him.

1008
00:41:28,768 --> 00:41:31,134
I said yes.

1009
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,100
That's...

1010
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,567
That's great.

1011
00:42:15,768 --> 00:42:18,300
