1
00:03:08,248 --> 00:03:11,194
A promise...

2
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:14,894
should never give be given to anyone

3
00:03:22,298 --> 00:03:27,543
lf ever given...

4
00:03:28,068 --> 00:03:30,514
that promise should never be broken

5
00:03:31,758 --> 00:03:37,492
Never break a promise

6
00:03:38,168 --> 00:03:40,124
Someone's hand...

7
00:03:41,368 --> 00:03:43,336
should never be held

8
00:03:44,738 --> 00:03:46,694
lf ever...

9
00:03:48,268 --> 00:03:51,055
that hand should never leave yours

10
00:03:56,438 --> 00:03:58,406
To the clouds...

11
00:03:59,808 --> 00:04:03,084
l want to soar

12
00:04:03,338 --> 00:04:05,294
Like a kite...

13
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:10,294
l want to fly

14
00:04:10,538 --> 00:04:13,814
Then a stranger will come...

15
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:17,025
to take you away as his bride

16
00:04:17,308 --> 00:04:20,323
l'll defy every norm

17
00:04:20,578 --> 00:04:24,184
l won't leave my father's house

18
00:04:24,258 --> 00:04:27,546
Never defy destiny

19
00:04:27,628 --> 00:04:31,064
Hush, say nothing

20
00:04:31,318 --> 00:04:32,785
Never...

21
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:41,353
make promises

22
00:04:49,108 --> 00:04:51,076
lf ever...

23
00:04:54,888 --> 00:04:57,334
then never break your promise

24
00:05:22,078 --> 00:05:23,215
Tarababu...

25
00:05:23,358 --> 00:05:28,113
the girls are growing up. Your school
is surviving on government grants

26
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:32,423
And your brother does nothing.
You have old debts to pay

27
00:05:32,658 --> 00:05:36,754
For all the wedding songs you sing,
do you ever think about...

28
00:05:36,758 --> 00:05:40,433
your daughters, their weddings?
- What can l do?

29
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:47,892
Use your connections in government.
There are so many property disputes!

30
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:52,143
Make a killing.
- Forever the broker...

31
00:05:52,198 --> 00:05:54,996
How many times must l tell you,
l'm an artiste not a broker.

32
00:05:55,248 --> 00:05:59,014
The art is all l know and of art
l'll make a living, not out of bribes.

33
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,214
Eat a carrot.

34
00:06:10,798 --> 00:06:12,754
Obeisances.
- Bless you

35
00:06:17,148 --> 00:06:19,764
Has everyone reached safely?
- Yes

36
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,136
Rambhajan, what's going on?

37
00:06:23,398 --> 00:06:28,313
After 5 years of running after
a 100 acre-contract in Chamba...

38
00:06:28,528 --> 00:06:32,305
we still don't possess the land?
- lt's not like what it was

39
00:06:32,378 --> 00:06:35,324
The government changed,
and everything changed

40
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:40,673
The project is worth Rs.10 billion and
l've pumped in 600 million already

41
00:06:40,648 --> 00:06:44,641
Deals have been finalised
with international companies

42
00:06:44,718 --> 00:06:49,473
lf the government reneges,
we stand to lose Rs.6 billion

43
00:06:52,738 --> 00:06:54,046
Your brother is here

44
00:06:54,178 --> 00:06:56,476
Come here, kids!
- Uncle...

45
00:06:59,468 --> 00:07:01,595
How have you been?
Give me a kiss

46
00:07:02,998 --> 00:07:05,614
Hello, brother.
- Hello, brother-in-Law

47
00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:08,344
Do you like Chamba?
- There's something about Chamba

48
00:07:10,858 --> 00:07:15,374
Lady, are enjoying it or not?
- Yes. But not like Scotland

49
00:07:16,398 --> 00:07:19,515
And you, Janki...?
- No opinions

50
00:07:19,608 --> 00:07:22,054
Happiness for a brother
is happiness for a sister

51
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:28,654
Where's Manav?
- He is in Delhi

52
00:07:28,908 --> 00:07:33,982
Why? He didn't come with you?
- l said, come. But he said, carry on

53
00:07:34,028 --> 00:07:38,943
He'll be travelling alone.
- Strange. His first lndia tour

54
00:07:38,928 --> 00:07:42,932
And he wants to travel alone?
- He doesn't obey you

55
00:07:42,998 --> 00:07:46,775
and you think he will listen to us?
- Said he'd take in lndia on his way

56
00:09:16,718 --> 00:09:20,154
Our most sought-after man
is standing here! Come on

57
00:09:21,848 --> 00:09:24,464
Put the files in the car.
We're going to the commissioner

58
00:09:24,568 --> 00:09:26,695
Good morning uncle.
- Good morning. Where were you?

59
00:09:26,978 --> 00:09:28,934
Anyway now that you're here,
you can work on this project

60
00:09:29,058 --> 00:09:32,004
Your father is cross.
He's waiting for you

61
00:09:32,108 --> 00:09:36,533
Would Mr. Manav know
how a father aches for a son?

62
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:40,176
Dad...
- Welcome, sir

63
00:09:41,408 --> 00:09:42,545
Welcome to Chamba

64
00:09:48,138 --> 00:09:53,053
Never mind, your apologies
are accepted

65
00:09:53,428 --> 00:09:56,374
l know Your Highness,
what you are about to say

66
00:09:56,698 --> 00:09:58,654
And what will l say?
- You'll say Manav my son,...

67
00:09:59,838 --> 00:10:02,955
not for Daddy's sake but
do spare a thought for yourself

68
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:09,984
Such a long journey, all alone?
Your first trip to lndia from London

69
00:10:10,358 --> 00:10:15,762
You could've gotten lost.
You could've been robbed, kidnapped

70
00:10:16,128 --> 00:10:18,084
What if?

71
00:10:19,818 --> 00:10:22,605
But nothing of the sort happened.
Nothing happened, Dad

72
00:10:23,988 --> 00:10:30,223
To tell the truth...
- l know, what you're about to say

73
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:32,665
You'll say...

74
00:10:33,118 --> 00:10:37,384
lf you want to see lndia, don't
watch Her out of a helicopter

75
00:10:38,258 --> 00:10:44,982
Get into a second class railway coach,
in ramshackle buses, in stuffy lanes

76
00:10:44,988 --> 00:10:53,180
Observe the lndian succeeding in doing
nothing, and yet he smiles, he sings

77
00:10:56,838 --> 00:10:58,794
And Chamba is the best

78
00:10:59,728 --> 00:11:05,564
That's why l picked up this latest
Digital Floppy camera from Singapore

79
00:11:14,088 --> 00:11:17,364
Your Brownie...
he missed you the most

80
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:20,076
Go. He's very annoyed with you

81
00:11:20,918 --> 00:11:24,263
Did you follow that father-son lingo?

82
00:11:24,348 --> 00:11:26,145
Shut up.
- As always

83
00:11:26,338 --> 00:11:29,557
Brownie...

84
00:11:31,888 --> 00:11:33,025
Mad at me?

85
00:11:35,408 --> 00:11:36,887
Sorry l'm late

86
00:11:38,718 --> 00:11:39,753
Won't you forgive me?

87
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:45,376
Coming for a walk?

88
00:11:46,798 --> 00:11:47,776
No...?

89
00:11:48,878 --> 00:11:51,176
l'm going.
lf you want, come along

90
00:12:45,878 --> 00:12:47,015
Wonderful?

91
00:12:50,848 --> 00:12:52,315
Shall we snap a photo?

92
00:13:24,128 --> 00:13:28,394
Only the minister can
approve this project

93
00:13:28,618 --> 00:13:32,054
Who can make him do it?
- Only one man, sir

94
00:13:32,628 --> 00:13:37,053
His childhood friend. Tarababu.
- Then rope him in

95
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:42,691
He is a very proud man. Tried my best
to do him in, but he won't relent

96
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,935
Whoever...?

97
00:14:06,868 --> 00:14:08,335
Wherever...

98
00:14:09,918 --> 00:14:11,863
wherever you are...

99
00:14:13,108 --> 00:14:14,257
l'm coming

100
00:14:46,138 --> 00:14:48,094
My heart, restless...

101
00:14:50,948 --> 00:14:53,075
l gaze upon the pathway

102
00:14:55,758 --> 00:15:00,274
With an anxious heart
l gaze upon the pathways

103
00:15:00,498 --> 00:15:05,094
Life's so boring,
bereft of music

104
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:09,896
Come to me, my love...

105
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:13,224
let's make music
together

106
00:16:03,748 --> 00:16:08,014
Rains drench me

107
00:16:08,398 --> 00:16:13,153
l feel an anguish

108
00:16:25,558 --> 00:16:30,143
A feeling, l wonder...

109
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:35,442
l have lost something...
but what have l lost?

110
00:16:37,738 --> 00:16:42,163
Don't stay mum,
say something

111
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:46,485
Come dance with me
fall in step with me...

112
00:16:48,898 --> 00:16:51,685
let's make music together

113
00:17:39,868 --> 00:17:44,123
l do not know you

114
00:17:44,388 --> 00:17:48,939
You do not know me

115
00:17:49,328 --> 00:17:56,211
Let's get to know each other,
come into my heart...

116
00:17:57,018 --> 00:18:00,306
just for the sake of our hearts

117
00:18:06,478 --> 00:18:11,074
l feel whatever you feel

118
00:18:11,448 --> 00:18:15,544
Come, let's share our feelings

119
00:18:17,378 --> 00:18:20,176
Let's make music
together

120
00:19:24,158 --> 00:19:26,126
Truss up the rope.
Tie it around your waist

121
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:24,104
My name is Manav Mehta.
Manav Kumar Mehta

122
00:20:25,018 --> 00:20:28,784
From London.
What a way to meet!

123
00:20:30,788 --> 00:20:32,426
May l have this picture of yours?

124
00:20:55,078 --> 00:20:57,046
Buy your vegetables

125
00:22:06,778 --> 00:22:10,123
Mr. Brownie, have you ever
seen such a sight?

126
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:14,954
Tarababu. That's who l am.
This is uncivilised

127
00:22:15,018 --> 00:22:17,805
You'll deal with me!
- What happened?

128
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:22,172
His son was falling off the hill.
My girls rescued him

129
00:22:22,228 --> 00:22:27,632
The cheek! He took their pictures!
Tell me Mr. Brigadier...

130
00:22:27,678 --> 00:22:31,603
if your daughter was photographed
on the sly by a stranger...

131
00:22:31,618 --> 00:22:34,132
while she's playing, bathing
in the rains, what would you do?

132
00:22:34,248 --> 00:22:36,955
l'd shoot him!
- And that's what l want to do

133
00:22:37,968 --> 00:22:41,142
ls gate-crashing into a party
civilised?

134
00:22:41,328 --> 00:22:43,694
And you're armed with a stick!
lf this isn't bullying, what is?

135
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:50,352
Madam! You stand in Chamba!
You may be rich. But don't take me on

136
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,336
Tarababu...

137
00:22:55,178 --> 00:22:57,476
l am Deep Mohan,
l'm the second in this family

138
00:22:57,748 --> 00:23:02,173
lf our boy has made a mistake,
we apologise with folded hands

139
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:07,814
Bring your son here
- The elders are apologising

140
00:23:07,778 --> 00:23:12,272
Don't be angry.
- lt's our son's birthday

141
00:23:12,498 --> 00:23:15,433
Won't you bless him?
- Yes, bless you

142
00:23:15,548 --> 00:23:17,994
Son, greet the uncle.
- Namaste uncle

143
00:23:18,108 --> 00:23:20,406
Give him a kiss. Go on...
- Bless you

144
00:23:20,828 --> 00:23:27,392
Tell your son that he should return
any indelicate photos

145
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:30,995
Now l'll take your leave.
- Tarababu, do stay for the party

146
00:23:31,418 --> 00:23:33,306
No, l'm leaving

147
00:23:37,118 --> 00:23:38,426
He forgot his stick.

148
00:23:51,548 --> 00:23:54,164
Good day. l'm Manav Mehta
- Good day.

149
00:23:55,398 --> 00:23:57,844
Your stick... you left it at my home

150
00:23:58,128 --> 00:24:00,084
l see...

151
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:05,783
So you're the errant prince...?
- l made the mistake of taking pictures

152
00:24:06,298 --> 00:24:11,861
l'm here to apologise.
- You hail from a good family

153
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:15,994
Return the photos you took

154
00:24:20,078 --> 00:24:24,174
Here you are.
- What's this wafer?

155
00:24:24,568 --> 00:24:28,004
l want the round thing you
put in the camera... reel..?

156
00:24:28,288 --> 00:24:34,420
No, this is a floppy. This camera
uses a floppy... no reel system

157
00:24:34,758 --> 00:24:36,066
What?

158
00:24:36,368 --> 00:24:38,324
Let me take a picture of yours

159
00:24:40,048 --> 00:24:41,515
Forget it...

160
00:24:42,298 --> 00:24:48,692
You keep it. We don't understand
computers. But henceforth you...

161
00:24:48,868 --> 00:24:52,474
l don't need photos.
You are such beautiful people

162
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:55,004
The image is burnt right in my heart.
- What...?

163
00:24:55,918 --> 00:24:57,886
May l take your leave?

164
00:25:01,378 --> 00:25:03,005
Nice guy

165
00:25:09,068 --> 00:25:15,962
That's what these artists are
Passionate, emotional, sentimental

166
00:25:16,128 --> 00:25:20,542
But Tarababu is annoyed with us.
- But Deep handled him very well

167
00:25:20,868 --> 00:25:25,692
But mind, the Goddesses of
wealth and learning don't get along

168
00:25:26,228 --> 00:25:30,415
They'll make wonderful music together.
- How come?

169
00:25:30,808 --> 00:25:35,723
l got an idea.
Tomorrow morning...

170
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:39,051
take us to Tarababu's house.
Then watch what l do

171
00:25:47,958 --> 00:25:50,244
You...
- Tarababu...

172
00:25:51,158 --> 00:25:53,604
l am Jagmohan.
The eldest brother in the family

173
00:25:55,008 --> 00:26:01,072
l'm Manav's father. We're here
to apologise for Manav's impertinence

174
00:26:01,198 --> 00:26:08,479
Good Lord! Please forget it. l didn't
realise the matter would drag this far

175
00:26:08,468 --> 00:26:13,724
Never imagined such wealthy
people can be so humble

176
00:26:13,758 --> 00:26:19,503
Last night Rambhajan told me about you.
So rich, yet so simple

177
00:26:19,858 --> 00:26:25,433
You know? He has lunched with
Prime Ministers

178
00:26:25,628 --> 00:26:29,155
And your picture appears
on front-pages?

179
00:26:29,568 --> 00:26:32,184
No matter how famous
the worshippers of wealth...

180
00:26:33,098 --> 00:26:35,396
we're still bow before
the priests of art

181
00:26:35,568 --> 00:26:40,915
No, l'm a petty singer
from the country... folk singer

182
00:26:41,148 --> 00:26:44,879
Tarababu... this simplicity
is what draws us

183
00:26:45,118 --> 00:26:50,693
l am really ashamed for
my misbehaviour that last evening

184
00:26:50,728 --> 00:26:52,036
Sorry, really sorry

185
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:58,731
l'll accept your apology only
if you accept our little gift

186
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,216
Gift...?

187
00:27:03,078 --> 00:27:05,034
Unveil it

188
00:27:35,928 --> 00:27:39,705
You have infused our hermitage
as if with Soul

189
00:27:40,578 --> 00:27:44,514
The Goddess has come home to me

190
00:27:48,598 --> 00:27:50,225
l am Santram.
- l see...

191
00:27:50,358 --> 00:27:52,326
Consultant
- l see

192
00:27:53,248 --> 00:27:56,684
l am Brijmohan.
l hope you liked the idol

193
00:27:56,998 --> 00:27:58,408
Much

194
00:28:29,578 --> 00:28:32,513
So where were we?
... yes, yoga

195
00:28:50,738 --> 00:28:53,673
Manasi.
- Coming

196
00:28:54,588 --> 00:28:56,544
Take the class till l return

197
00:28:59,558 --> 00:29:03,813
Baba... what is it?
- Come dear, let me introduce you

198
00:29:05,008 --> 00:29:07,306
Look, all the way from Bombay,
they brought for us this idol

199
00:29:07,348 --> 00:29:09,213
The Goddess of Knowledge

200
00:29:13,648 --> 00:29:18,233
My only child, Manasi.
My only, yet she scolds me

201
00:29:21,598 --> 00:29:23,725
l forgot to introduce my family.

202
00:29:24,008 --> 00:29:26,624
My brother Balwant, my sister-in-law
and their daughters

203
00:29:30,198 --> 00:29:38,628
And my disciples.
Together, we make wonderful music

204
00:29:42,608 --> 00:29:44,235
Well written

205
00:29:44,368 --> 00:29:47,804
The rhythm in the song
is soul to music

206
00:29:47,898 --> 00:29:51,334
ln the rhythm in your breath
find love's soul

207
00:29:51,578 --> 00:29:55,014
Wonderful!
- My daughter composed it

208
00:29:56,388 --> 00:29:59,505
My child, you composed this?
- Yes

209
00:30:03,288 --> 00:30:04,425
Tarababu...
- Yes?

210
00:30:04,568 --> 00:30:08,174
l have a request.
l'm hosting a party tonight

211
00:30:08,258 --> 00:30:11,193
My guests are coming from Delhi.
l'd like you to come

212
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:13,915
Your presence
will add a feather to my cap

213
00:30:14,028 --> 00:30:19,375
How can l refuse you?
- What about Mania's wedding?

214
00:30:19,898 --> 00:30:26,940
Oh yes. The rest of you can go there.
Manasi and l will go to their house...

215
00:30:27,108 --> 00:30:28,746
for dinner

216
00:30:38,168 --> 00:30:41,114
This is Mr. Jindal,
the CEO of Zee TV

217
00:30:41,538 --> 00:30:45,474
Tarababu sings beautifully

218
00:30:46,028 --> 00:30:50,442
l'd like you to showcase his talent
through your channel

219
00:30:51,788 --> 00:30:54,905
Aunt, how much does
my balloon weigh?

220
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,594
Your balloon...weighs...

221
00:31:10,218 --> 00:31:11,697
The balloon scared you?

222
00:31:13,268 --> 00:31:16,487
So it was your prank?
- No, the kids

223
00:31:17,698 --> 00:31:22,283
You may think of me as a child.
- That's apparent

224
00:31:24,108 --> 00:31:30,502
He...? He's my heart. My sweetheart.
Brownie is my friend. Say hello

225
00:31:33,728 --> 00:31:37,983
Don't you have friends?
- No. My relatives are my friends

226
00:31:39,338 --> 00:31:43,763
l too have so many of them.
My Papa, my grannie in Bombay

227
00:31:44,628 --> 00:31:46,926
Would you like to meet her?
- lf you introduce me

228
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:50,114
Hold him.

229
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:53,674
One minute. Stay here.
l'll be back

230
00:31:58,098 --> 00:32:00,396
l too get one picture
with the big boss

231
00:32:00,438 --> 00:32:03,942
l'm privileged to be
photographed with you

232
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,124
Welcome

233
00:32:10,278 --> 00:32:12,178
Tarababu's daughter, aren't you?

234
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:16,394
As soon as you entered
you make friends with the dog

235
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:20,025
That's called a smart girl

236
00:32:21,918 --> 00:32:24,364
Sorry, l took a while. Come

237
00:32:28,808 --> 00:32:30,605
And she's striking relations

238
00:32:32,168 --> 00:32:37,083
Tarababu, whenever you're in Bombay
you must stay with us

239
00:32:37,138 --> 00:32:43,702
My second cousin lives in Bombay.
She's a television reporter.

240
00:32:43,868 --> 00:32:47,474
Prabha Shankar, from Mumbai
The way she speaks!

241
00:32:49,638 --> 00:32:51,936
Look, my Grannie

242
00:32:53,808 --> 00:32:56,754
My only friend who knows me
through and through

243
00:33:05,678 --> 00:33:07,305
Have you seen Manav?
- Yes

244
00:33:07,368 --> 00:33:09,825
Where is he?
- He's... gone

245
00:33:12,018 --> 00:33:15,624
You teach yoga very well

246
00:33:20,358 --> 00:33:23,145
Will you teach me?
- Sure

247
00:33:24,528 --> 00:33:26,655
But...you will have
to become my student

248
00:33:27,408 --> 00:33:28,887
Definitely

249
00:33:30,298 --> 00:33:32,254
Nice band, no?

250
00:33:33,988 --> 00:33:36,286
Will you do something for me?
- Yes?

251
00:33:37,678 --> 00:33:42,433
My friend, Mania is getting married.
Baba dragged me here

252
00:33:43,768 --> 00:33:45,724
And you want to be
at your friend's party?

253
00:33:46,328 --> 00:33:50,924
Yes Shanno, lla...
everyone is there

254
00:33:51,618 --> 00:33:53,085
Will you give me a lift?

255
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:02,254
l'll be seeing you.
- Seeing me...? Why?

256
00:34:03,488 --> 00:34:04,466
To learn yoga

257
00:34:05,888 --> 00:34:07,788
Sure.
- Promise?

258
00:34:08,228 --> 00:34:10,184
Promise.
- Sure?

259
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:12,415
Not sure

260
00:34:22,168 --> 00:34:26,593
Manasi! We thought you won't come.
We've been waiting for so long!

261
00:34:26,658 --> 00:34:28,956
How could l not come?
- You must sing today

262
00:34:29,218 --> 00:34:30,856
You must!
- You sing

263
00:34:30,988 --> 00:34:33,434
No, you first.
- You sing, l won't

264
00:34:33,548 --> 00:34:35,846
l'll begin. But you must sing.
- Come on...

265
00:34:57,758 --> 00:35:00,204
lf not for love...

266
00:35:01,128 --> 00:35:03,574
what's left to die for?

267
00:35:05,548 --> 00:35:09,814
lf not for love,
what's left to live for?

268
00:35:11,638 --> 00:35:13,606
Love's sweet

269
00:35:13,728 --> 00:35:16,174
And bittersweet

270
00:35:16,288 --> 00:35:18,904
A promise to be kept... love

271
00:35:19,018 --> 00:35:21,316
A tie between lovers... love

272
00:35:32,808 --> 00:35:35,424
lf not for love...

273
00:35:36,328 --> 00:35:39,126
what's left to die for?

274
00:37:02,088 --> 00:37:06,775
Love on Earth,
God in Heaven

275
00:37:06,998 --> 00:37:12,072
Between Heaven and Earth
lies life

276
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:27,782
Say it in a hundred words...

277
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:33,083
yet it means the same

278
00:37:35,298 --> 00:37:37,493
God, most beautiful... love

279
00:37:37,928 --> 00:37:40,044
More beautiful than God... love

280
00:38:44,878 --> 00:38:48,974
What love is, who has ever known?

281
00:38:49,688 --> 00:38:53,943
What love is, who doesn't know?

282
00:38:54,978 --> 00:38:57,378
Myriad are the paths
in the City of Love...

283
00:38:57,478 --> 00:39:01,574
but which leads to my lover?
The journey may be long

284
00:39:01,578 --> 00:39:05,582
Yet you set out at such a tender age,
looking for love, what is love...?

285
00:39:05,818 --> 00:39:10,710
Pain, or salve for the suffering?
ls it love or God Himself?

286
00:39:10,768 --> 00:39:14,545
ls love God?

287
00:39:19,748 --> 00:39:21,875
lf not for love...

288
00:39:22,638 --> 00:39:25,254
what's left to die for?

289
00:39:27,288 --> 00:39:31,384
lf not for love,
what's left to live for?

290
00:39:32,258 --> 00:39:38,493
You only heard of love

291
00:39:40,908 --> 00:39:45,333
l have loved

292
00:39:47,488 --> 00:39:49,934
lt's Eden

293
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:52,665
lt's strewn with thorns

294
00:40:08,738 --> 00:40:12,674
lf not for love...

295
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:17,974
what's left to die for?

296
00:40:19,008 --> 00:40:23,763
lf not for love,
what's left to live for?

297
00:40:24,298 --> 00:40:26,596
Love's sweet

298
00:40:26,698 --> 00:40:28,996
And bittersweet

299
00:41:47,428 --> 00:41:49,316
What's going on?

300
00:41:57,618 --> 00:41:59,085
See...?

301
00:42:01,148 --> 00:42:03,104
Come on

302
00:42:47,728 --> 00:42:51,164
Remember last night's promise?
About teaching me yoga?

303
00:42:53,498 --> 00:42:55,454
Here l am

304
00:43:00,068 --> 00:43:02,195
Raise your arms, both

305
00:43:03,118 --> 00:43:04,426
Lift

306
00:43:05,198 --> 00:43:06,836
Turn

307
00:43:08,988 --> 00:43:10,364
Bend

308
00:43:10,968 --> 00:43:12,276
Over

309
00:43:20,108 --> 00:43:22,406
Stretch

310
00:44:35,228 --> 00:44:38,664
Look Manav, this isn't happening

311
00:44:40,038 --> 00:44:44,065
This won't happen.
- What won't happen?

312
00:44:46,858 --> 00:44:48,826
You know what l mean

313
00:44:51,508 --> 00:44:53,965
We're two different people.
- Yes. So?

314
00:44:55,038 --> 00:44:58,474
We are two different people.
And two people meet

315
00:44:59,848 --> 00:45:01,975
Have you ever seen the
mountains and valleys together?

316
00:45:02,578 --> 00:45:06,014
The earth, the sky...
- Are you in love with them?

317
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:08,876
What...?
- Are you in love?

318
00:45:19,088 --> 00:45:24,162
Manav, listen...
hear me out, try to understand

319
00:45:25,178 --> 00:45:31,071
Girls in my family do not
fall in love. My circle...

320
00:45:31,048 --> 00:45:34,222
consists only of my parents
and my sisters

321
00:45:35,758 --> 00:45:40,775
Understandable.
- You and l are different

322
00:45:43,068 --> 00:45:48,961
l am responsible for my Baba.
Only l understand his pathos

323
00:45:50,758 --> 00:45:54,194
l don't want to add to his sorrows.
- Granted

324
00:45:54,538 --> 00:46:00,841
Period. So get this.
There's nothing between us

325
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:04,783
How can l do that? There is.
- What is...?

326
00:46:05,668 --> 00:46:09,764
We're falling in love.
- You are very stubborn

327
00:46:09,988 --> 00:46:13,276
l'm also honest..
- So for the last time...

328
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:19,242
take an honest answer from me.
l'm not in love with you. Okay?

329
00:46:19,928 --> 00:46:21,725
Not okay

330
00:46:21,858 --> 00:46:26,283
l can't believe this.
- Because l refused point blank?

331
00:46:26,348 --> 00:46:30,603
No, you got scared.
- Of whom?

332
00:46:31,158 --> 00:46:35,413
Of me. l might
cheat you and run away

333
00:46:38,208 --> 00:46:44,772
Look... don't try your magic on me.
- So there is a magic in me?

334
00:46:45,588 --> 00:46:48,523
l'll never see you again! Never

335
00:47:34,568 --> 00:47:36,524
Long live our Minister!
- Long live

336
00:47:55,088 --> 00:47:59,184
l'm grateful to the world famous
Mehta family forjoining our efforts...

337
00:47:59,188 --> 00:48:03,534
for the development
of Himachal Pradesh

338
00:48:04,388 --> 00:48:11,271
First of all l'd like to thank
Tarababu, a childhood friend of mine

339
00:48:11,598 --> 00:48:16,023
Tarababu, the pride of Chamba.
Even in the face of abject poverty...

340
00:48:16,028 --> 00:48:17,984
he has never discarded
his ideals

341
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:23,245
Yes, my first trip to lndia.
- Manav...

342
00:49:25,268 --> 00:49:27,236
Cold drink?

343
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:48,563
See that girl in the grey scarf?
- Yes...?

344
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:50,734
Take this to her. Go on

345
00:49:54,608 --> 00:49:57,008
All this was possible
thanks to you

346
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:03,293
Soft drink, for you.
- No thanks

347
00:50:06,408 --> 00:50:08,376
Excuse me...

348
00:50:12,498 --> 00:50:15,285
Give that to me. Take another one.
- Why...?

349
00:50:15,548 --> 00:50:17,345
l'm thirsty

350
00:50:17,468 --> 00:50:19,436
Wait...

351
00:50:37,288 --> 00:50:39,904
What are you doing here?
Come and meet the minister

352
00:50:41,298 --> 00:50:42,925
l'll join you

353
00:51:03,568 --> 00:51:06,844
Thrice l asked you to come on stage.
You never heard me? Come on

354
00:51:09,658 --> 00:51:11,296
Let's go

355
00:51:25,788 --> 00:51:30,213
Now you understand?
- l see

356
00:51:32,198 --> 00:51:34,655
Tomorrow we're leaving for Bombay

357
00:52:03,948 --> 00:52:07,714
l knew. You'd come
and you'd come here

358
00:52:10,998 --> 00:52:14,434
Now tell me
you don't love me

359
00:52:16,128 --> 00:52:18,744
Say it. Go on

360
00:53:27,168 --> 00:53:29,136
Why are you silent?

361
00:53:30,058 --> 00:53:32,014
Oh it's nothing

362
00:53:36,788 --> 00:53:40,224
l know what you're thinking.
- What...?

363
00:53:41,598 --> 00:53:43,725
Right out of a Hindi movie.

364
00:53:44,168 --> 00:53:46,955
Boy from the city goes to the hills
Falls in love with a girl.

365
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:50,614
Then he deserts her

366
00:53:51,058 --> 00:53:54,994
And then?
- He never returns

367
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:10,241
But... that will never happen.
This is no movie, this is reality

368
00:54:10,768 --> 00:54:15,023
This is my life.
Of course...

369
00:54:15,898 --> 00:54:20,585
there will be resistance.
l got to face my family

370
00:54:21,118 --> 00:54:23,086
And you with your family

371
00:54:26,578 --> 00:54:28,534
But it'll work out

372
00:54:29,778 --> 00:54:31,746
Manav

373
00:54:33,468 --> 00:54:36,255
Got to leave.
- Listen, Manav...

374
00:54:38,598 --> 00:54:40,554
l embroidered this for you...

375
00:54:42,448 --> 00:54:48,193
But that's mine!
- Now it belongs to us both. Look

376
00:54:49,498 --> 00:54:54,413
What's Manav-si?
- Means... like Manav

377
00:55:02,968 --> 00:55:05,755
Manasi... just like Manav

378
00:55:18,298 --> 00:55:22,883
Thank you very much, Tarababu.
Do meet us if you come to Bombay

379
00:55:23,578 --> 00:55:27,514
You must take care of your health.
- You too

380
00:56:30,108 --> 00:56:32,406
See that temple?
- Yes?

381
00:56:32,898 --> 00:56:38,734
lt's said that the God of that temple
grants every wish. Will you come?

382
00:56:39,728 --> 00:56:42,845
l don't go to temples.
- What...?

383
00:56:43,248 --> 00:56:45,705
Never been to one

384
00:56:48,378 --> 00:56:53,133
l won't stop you if you want to go.
- l don't understand

385
00:56:54,478 --> 00:56:59,723
When l was eleven, Mummy died.
She always told me...

386
00:56:59,698 --> 00:57:06,160
Manav, God lives in your heart
Here. ln my conscience

387
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,818
After all what is God?
A belief, the truth

388
00:57:11,398 --> 00:57:16,973
Man gives Him many forms.
A book, an idol, the flame of a lamp

389
00:57:17,338 --> 00:57:18,965
l see God in me. That's all

390
00:57:20,698 --> 00:57:27,752
Your love too is a faith in me.
- Yes, it's a faith

391
00:57:28,398 --> 00:57:32,801
As a token of that faith, l bought
you something from the temple shop

392
00:57:33,198 --> 00:57:35,154
Want to take a look?

393
00:57:37,678 --> 00:57:39,976
lt's cheap. Made of stones

394
00:57:41,528 --> 00:57:43,496
But hundred percent genuine

395
00:57:46,018 --> 00:57:47,974
Show me how it looks

396
00:58:13,368 --> 00:58:15,336
Who gave you this necklace?

397
00:58:16,898 --> 00:58:18,206
Who gave it?

398
00:58:20,648 --> 00:58:23,196
You love your Baba, don't you?

399
00:58:23,628 --> 00:58:25,926
You love me?
- Baba, wait...

400
00:58:27,478 --> 00:58:31,084
Before you say anything
before you misunderstand me...

401
00:58:32,288 --> 00:58:37,362
l want to tell you everything.
Manav gave that to me

402
00:58:38,218 --> 00:58:42,973
Why? What for?
- Because he loves me dearly

403
00:58:45,598 --> 00:58:49,853
And you...?
- Me too

404
00:58:51,048 --> 00:58:54,484
Are you in your senses?
Do you know who he is?

405
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:58,994
They are very wealthy people!
We have nothing in common

406
00:58:59,698 --> 00:59:03,634
But l'm concerned with Manav.
Not with rich people

407
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:06,927
This is impossible!
lmpossible

408
00:59:11,168 --> 00:59:13,625
l'm Manav. From Bombay

409
00:59:18,548 --> 00:59:21,824
Why are you sounding worried?
Situation tense?

410
00:59:23,678 --> 00:59:25,634
Baba... Manasi...

411
00:59:26,078 --> 00:59:28,205
He has come to know?

412
00:59:32,978 --> 00:59:37,881
All right, put him on the line.
- Baba... Manav, for you

413
00:59:41,788 --> 00:59:48,182
l'm sorry l couldn't meet you before
leaving, wanted to talk, but l couldn't

414
00:59:49,808 --> 00:59:55,212
l'm glad you found out that l...
are you listening?

415
00:59:55,578 --> 00:59:59,844
Yes, l'm listening. Go on.
- l was saying...

416
00:59:59,848 --> 01:00:04,922
the promise l made to Manasi
before l left... is firm

417
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:11,192
l will marry Manasi.
That's my commitment and l will keep it

418
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:16,623
As her father, you must be worried,
you must be angry with Manasi

419
01:00:17,158 --> 01:00:20,764
ln your place, l'd probably do the same.
But don't worry

420
01:00:21,328 --> 01:00:24,263
God be with me,
l'm resolute

421
01:00:37,198 --> 01:00:38,665
Everything will be fine

422
01:00:38,798 --> 01:00:42,734
Your father is an artiste.
Who else can understand love better?

423
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:47,504
Manav, call me later. Please

424
01:00:57,228 --> 01:01:02,575
Where have you been? l've been going
Manav-Manav. And not a reply?

425
01:01:03,578 --> 01:01:08,493
Another twist to Manav's love story.
Manasi's father has found out...

426
01:01:08,478 --> 01:01:13,142
that Manasi loves me.
l mean, that we're in love

427
01:01:13,198 --> 01:01:16,133
Forget about love and
look at this photo

428
01:01:16,238 --> 01:01:19,184
She's the girl Deep Mohan and Shaku
have chosen for you

429
01:01:19,928 --> 01:01:26,322
l told her father clearly.
l'll keep my promise

430
01:01:26,498 --> 01:01:32,733
But Jagmohan has decided otherwise.
Nikita is from the Kurasia family

431
01:01:33,238 --> 01:01:38,483
l approve. She has class.
- Grannie, this is not fair

432
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:41,144
You've sat through my story
and yet no sign of sympathy?

433
01:01:41,728 --> 01:01:47,303
lt's pack up for all these girls.
- Sympathies are only for the obedient

434
01:01:49,108 --> 01:01:51,895
You will marry the girl
l approve of

435
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:56,574
No, Grannie. This isn't fair.
You're putting me into a corner

436
01:01:56,958 --> 01:01:59,847
l got this melodrama up and running.
You want me to stage another drama?

437
01:02:03,468 --> 01:02:06,904
You're my grannie!
How can you do this to me? Unfair

438
01:02:08,278 --> 01:02:10,075
At least take a look
at the photo

439
01:02:32,568 --> 01:02:35,423
When in love, never fall.
Rise, my child

440
01:02:45,138 --> 01:02:48,915
You... here?
- The girls are worried about you

441
01:02:49,948 --> 01:02:52,246
l went to call Prabha
- Bombay?

442
01:02:53,798 --> 01:02:57,336
Prabha the only one
l have in Bombay

443
01:02:59,188 --> 01:03:03,284
What did she advise?
- What can she say?

444
01:03:04,158 --> 01:03:06,456
She asked me to take Manasi
over to Bombay

445
01:03:06,878 --> 01:03:11,474
She wants to talk to Manasi
before she finds a solution

446
01:03:13,618 --> 01:03:21,150
She also said not to inform Jaggi.
l'm worried

447
01:03:21,308 --> 01:03:23,276
Are you going to Bombay?

448
01:03:25,158 --> 01:03:30,903
l can't spend another night here.
l must go to Bombay

449
01:03:41,188 --> 01:03:43,486
So here you are in Bombay,
at least on this pretext

450
01:03:44,078 --> 01:03:46,865
Where is Ashwin?
- l divorced him

451
01:03:47,918 --> 01:03:50,216
Why?
- He deserved it

452
01:03:50,648 --> 01:03:53,765
But l got a memento from him.
My Tunna

453
01:04:10,288 --> 01:04:14,713
Your story leads me
to one conclusion

454
01:04:15,738 --> 01:04:20,653
At seven tomorrow morning
surprise Manav Mehta

455
01:04:23,378 --> 01:04:27,371
l told you. Mr. Mehta doesn't
meet anybody on Sundays

456
01:04:27,448 --> 01:04:33,512
Tell him l've come from Chamba.
l'm Tarababu. l'm a close friend

457
01:04:33,698 --> 01:04:38,453
l have orders not to wake up
anyone before 9.30

458
01:04:38,668 --> 01:04:42,604
Take a seat on this bench.
l'll find out after 9.30 or 10

459
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:45,294
l'm not going to sit here!
l'm his friend

460
01:04:46,528 --> 01:04:48,974
Only his friends come here.
Sit down

461
01:04:50,368 --> 01:04:52,268
Take a seat

462
01:04:52,708 --> 01:04:54,676
Baba, let's sit

463
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:02,734
One Tarababu from Chamba.
- Let him sit outside

464
01:05:08,328 --> 01:05:10,558
Sit here

465
01:05:14,358 --> 01:05:15,666
Sit

466
01:05:16,598 --> 01:05:19,214
We won't sit here.
- Why?

467
01:05:19,648 --> 01:05:25,052
May l talk on the telephone?
To Mr. Mehta or his son...?

468
01:05:25,098 --> 01:05:28,374
Mr. Mehta is asleep.
His son isn't in

469
01:05:28,788 --> 01:05:31,086
He went to his grandmother
last night

470
01:05:31,988 --> 01:05:33,455
Sit

471
01:05:54,748 --> 01:05:56,045
Brownie...

472
01:05:57,788 --> 01:05:58,937
Come here

473
01:05:59,878 --> 01:06:03,644
Your name's Brownie, right?
- You know him?

474
01:06:04,848 --> 01:06:08,124
Yes and he recognises me too

475
01:06:10,458 --> 01:06:14,394
You see? He knows us!

476
01:06:15,268 --> 01:06:17,224
l'll fix you later

477
01:06:18,948 --> 01:06:22,725
Hello. Shake hands, pal.
Handshake, no?

478
01:06:27,608 --> 01:06:29,735
l'm sure he'll go
and tell Jagmohan

479
01:06:32,578 --> 01:06:34,216
Lock him in the room

480
01:06:34,988 --> 01:06:36,944
Creating a nuisance
all morning

481
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:08,615
l'll talk to him

482
01:07:12,118 --> 01:07:13,096
Deep...

483
01:07:27,348 --> 01:07:29,304
We have come.
- Tarababu, when did you come?

484
01:07:30,218 --> 01:07:36,111
When? Been here since 7.30! The guard
is a rascal... didn't he tell you?

485
01:07:36,628 --> 01:07:38,266
We've been waiting for 6 hours

486
01:07:38,558 --> 01:07:42,324
And tell me where is Jagmohan?
- He's getting dressed

487
01:07:42,728 --> 01:07:48,075
We have guests from London.
He has a luncheon meeting with them

488
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:53,004
Please be seated. l'll inform him.
- We've waited all day...

489
01:07:53,078 --> 01:07:55,205
Let them sit under the awning

490
01:07:57,408 --> 01:08:00,844
You may sit here.
- Now we sit here

491
01:08:02,698 --> 01:08:04,666
Would you like some tea?

492
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,683
Water if you please.
- Right away

493
01:08:28,928 --> 01:08:31,943
You've made them sit here?

494
01:08:32,518 --> 01:08:36,124
They aren't non-entities.
Dear friends of my brother-in-law

495
01:08:36,368 --> 01:08:39,644
Tarababu from Chamba, right from
the lap of the Himalayas

496
01:08:39,828 --> 01:08:43,264
Let them enjoy the air conditioned
comfort of the waiting lounge

497
01:08:47,048 --> 01:08:51,144
You came without an appointment?
- Well sister, we...

498
01:09:15,728 --> 01:09:18,174
You heard what she had to say?
Didn't l tell you...?

499
01:09:18,458 --> 01:09:25,830
Call them up, take a appointment.
- What appointment?

500
01:09:26,148 --> 01:09:28,116
When they came to our house,
did they ask for an appointment?

501
01:09:29,998 --> 01:09:31,954
What a melodrama

502
01:09:57,028 --> 01:09:59,485
No, Baba. Let's leave

503
01:10:00,078 --> 01:10:05,482
Of course we will leave. But not
before we've seen the end of this

504
01:10:05,528 --> 01:10:12,252
Why do street performers come to
the Mehtas? For staging a melodrama?

505
01:10:12,738 --> 01:10:16,515
What...?
- The daughter is dolled-up

506
01:10:16,748 --> 01:10:21,003
To inveigle the prince...?
- My sister, you are...

507
01:10:21,238 --> 01:10:26,983
l'm not a sister to pimps like you!
You better go home

508
01:10:28,608 --> 01:10:34,513
Not until l've met Mr. Jagmohan.
- He's in a luncheon meeting

509
01:10:34,708 --> 01:10:39,566
What will you do there?
Wag your tail like a dog?

510
01:10:40,728 --> 01:10:47,941
l must tell Mr. Jagmohan that this
anglicised witch belongs in his kennels

511
01:10:48,108 --> 01:10:51,373
You called me a bitch!
How dare you?

512
01:10:51,938 --> 01:10:55,556
Throw them out!

513
01:10:55,948 --> 01:10:59,065
Tarababu...
- Brother... for hours...

514
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:05,061
Stop! Stop right there!
He called me a bitch

515
01:11:05,248 --> 01:11:08,854
Did he say it or not?
- He did

516
01:11:11,338 --> 01:11:16,742
You drop in uninvited and then
you call my sister-in-law...

517
01:11:16,788 --> 01:11:20,076
A witch! Yes, l called her a witch!

518
01:11:20,798 --> 01:11:25,064
Because of her misbehaviour

519
01:11:25,768 --> 01:11:32,981
Yes, Tarababu from Chamba.
Your friend, you brother

520
01:11:33,468 --> 01:11:36,995
Go ahead, give it to me

521
01:11:37,088 --> 01:11:41,024
You aren't in the right frame
of mind. Go home now.

522
01:11:41,098 --> 01:11:45,353
See me in my offices tomorrow.
- There! So you said it too?

523
01:11:45,428 --> 01:11:47,384
Yes, l have spoken

524
01:11:57,288 --> 01:12:04,672
Won't even offer his friend a seat,
not even a glass of water! Wonderful!

525
01:12:06,908 --> 01:12:13,632
My very guests who honoured me with
the idol of the goddess of Knowledge

526
01:12:13,638 --> 01:12:15,276
And those lofty talks!

527
01:12:15,338 --> 01:12:22,961
Of godliness manifest in art,
nobler than wealth

528
01:12:28,328 --> 01:12:34,221
Bit too sentimental, aren't you?
Artistes, troubadours, all the same

529
01:12:34,728 --> 01:12:38,164
They come wagging their tails
at the sight of currency

530
01:12:39,218 --> 01:12:43,154
Knowledge-worship, that's a sham.
You slave to Wealth

531
01:12:43,548 --> 01:12:46,984
You drool at the sight of cash,
for all that big talk

532
01:12:47,878 --> 01:12:52,303
lf you want to be compensated for your
work, take your money and get lost

533
01:12:53,008 --> 01:12:55,306
l get it.

534
01:12:56,688 --> 01:13:04,561
l want my compensation,
and l want it right now

535
01:13:04,868 --> 01:13:09,123
Tell me how much money you want

536
01:13:22,508 --> 01:13:25,443
Don't touch me

537
01:13:25,708 --> 01:13:31,556
You played with my emotions!
Now l am compensated

538
01:13:33,758 --> 01:13:35,783
What are you doing?
- Manav...

539
01:13:35,908 --> 01:13:37,864
What's going on here?

540
01:13:38,308 --> 01:13:43,223
You hit my father!
Do you realise what you've done?

541
01:13:44,728 --> 01:13:50,462
You raised your hand against the man
nobody in the world dares to insult?

542
01:13:50,658 --> 01:13:56,893
But...
- You've gone mad! Go away...

543
01:13:58,508 --> 01:14:00,635
lest l raise my hand too

544
01:14:02,518 --> 01:14:04,156
Leave

545
01:14:11,168 --> 01:14:14,604
Raise your hand.
Strike, Manav

546
01:14:15,488 --> 01:14:19,094
This concerns my father's honour.
- Your father's honour matters

547
01:14:21,108 --> 01:14:22,735
And my Baba has no honour?

548
01:14:24,468 --> 01:14:32,113
You are all alike. Just wealthy.
Statues, stuffed with money

549
01:14:32,418 --> 01:14:39,472
lf you want to leave, go. But l won't
let anyone insult my father, my family

550
01:14:40,598 --> 01:14:43,715
My father means everything to me!
Everything

551
01:14:45,728 --> 01:14:48,515
Understand?
- Yes...

552
01:14:50,218 --> 01:14:54,154
l understand.
Now you understand this too

553
01:14:55,828 --> 01:15:00,253
So much for your love
and your gift of love

554
01:15:57,538 --> 01:16:00,826
What will l tell Prabha?
- Baba...

555
01:16:04,598 --> 01:16:06,554
Don't cry

556
01:16:09,088 --> 01:16:11,204
Baba, let's sit there

557
01:16:16,298 --> 01:16:18,254
Sit

558
01:16:54,228 --> 01:16:56,196
My heart, restless...

559
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:01,166
l gaze upon the pathway

560
01:17:03,848 --> 01:17:08,433
With an anxious heart
l gaze upon the pathways

561
01:17:08,658 --> 01:17:10,785
Life's so boring...

562
01:17:11,068 --> 01:17:13,024
bereft of music

563
01:17:13,468 --> 01:17:18,053
My love...
come to me...

564
01:17:18,278 --> 01:17:21,497
let's make music
together

565
01:18:37,368 --> 01:18:39,324
That was the only way
to make you realise

566
01:18:39,768 --> 01:18:45,343
lt's a different world.
- Just as well that it's over so soon

567
01:18:48,428 --> 01:18:52,364
Life happens in chapters.
One ends, another begins

568
01:18:54,228 --> 01:18:56,196
Mama, this card

569
01:18:57,018 --> 01:18:59,805
Vikrant Entertainment Company...?
Where did you find this?

570
01:18:59,908 --> 01:19:01,705
Uncle had it

571
01:19:01,828 --> 01:19:06,583
Whose card is this? Vikrant Kapoor's
entertainment company...?

572
01:19:06,958 --> 01:19:11,372
We met him on our way in a stadium.
- Met him? What did he have to say?

573
01:19:11,758 --> 01:19:13,714
Nothing. He recognised me

574
01:19:14,328 --> 01:19:21,211
Walked up and asked me if l'm Tarababu.
Said he had heard my songs on radio

575
01:19:21,378 --> 01:19:24,313
And my photo was in the papers...
- Yes, last month?

576
01:19:24,418 --> 01:19:28,354
Yes. He had seen that.
He was all praise for me

577
01:19:28,748 --> 01:19:32,184
lnvited me to his studio.
Monday next, at eleven

578
01:19:32,758 --> 01:19:36,034
What did you say?
- l said yes, but who's going?

579
01:19:36,768 --> 01:19:39,885
Brother!
You know who he is?

580
01:19:40,138 --> 01:19:44,723
To me, he's a thief
plagiarizing my song

581
01:19:50,078 --> 01:19:56,074
Brother, he is Vikrant Kapoor!
The top star of television

582
01:19:58,668 --> 01:20:03,253
You ought to get dressed.
- Such a big man invites you

583
01:20:03,318 --> 01:20:05,764
And you want to go back to Chamba?
This is wrong

584
01:20:07,008 --> 01:20:12,412
For once, you ought to visit him.
Who knows what doors fate might open up

585
01:22:35,948 --> 01:22:43,491
You see Vikrant has four eyes, not two.
2 fronts, 2 rears. Excellent hindsight

586
01:22:44,218 --> 01:22:47,164
Go on, he has called you,
he must've seen you

587
01:22:47,268 --> 01:22:50,874
Go ahead. Good luck

588
01:22:55,288 --> 01:22:58,564
l'm Prabha Shankar. TV reporter.
l'm Tarababu's cousin

589
01:22:59,448 --> 01:23:02,394
l recognised Tarababu
the moment l set eyes on him

590
01:23:03,938 --> 01:23:07,544
l compose my own music

591
01:23:08,428 --> 01:23:11,374
But my company is always on the
lookout for talent in folk music...

592
01:23:11,408 --> 01:23:16,072
that lies strewn all over this land.
We pick, remix and make a killing...

593
01:23:16,128 --> 01:23:22,363
out of the very songs
that you sing for Jalandhar radio

594
01:23:22,698 --> 01:23:30,901
Remix...?
- Remix! Get your hands on any song

595
01:23:31,518 --> 01:23:35,943
Pick it or steal it.
Tinker with the orchestration

596
01:23:36,328 --> 01:23:39,764
Record it, remix it,
grab copyright

597
01:23:40,978 --> 01:23:44,197
Art is art whether
it's yours or someone else's

598
01:23:44,438 --> 01:23:48,534
Just make sure the cash registers
ring in the moolah

599
01:23:52,708 --> 01:23:57,372
Mr. Sadbud! How are you?
You're hardly to be seen nowadays

600
01:23:57,428 --> 01:24:01,524
And the papers are full of you,
your name is etched in my heart

601
01:24:02,558 --> 01:24:05,345
Sure you must meet me. This studio
belongs to you, why bother to ask me?

602
01:24:05,438 --> 01:24:09,215
Right now l'm in a board meeting,
call me in half an hour

603
01:24:16,808 --> 01:24:21,404
lf this scoundrel calls up again,
say l'm not in

604
01:24:26,588 --> 01:24:30,365
Are you wondering what a fraud l am?
- Yes...

605
01:24:30,978 --> 01:24:32,946
ln our business
it's the lingua franca

606
01:24:33,328 --> 01:24:37,583
Among friends, we're rude
With adversaries, we're polite

607
01:24:38,618 --> 01:24:41,997
They aren't familiar
with Bombay language

608
01:24:42,878 --> 01:24:48,282
You do not speak?
- What... can l say?

609
01:24:49,608 --> 01:24:52,896
Say that again
- What can l say?

610
01:24:54,898 --> 01:24:57,025
What can l say
That's verse

611
01:24:58,658 --> 01:25:04,005
Nice voice. You sing too?
- Sings better than me

612
01:25:04,518 --> 01:25:08,943
And dance?
- She majored in dance and music

613
01:25:11,258 --> 01:25:15,843
Right hunch!
Here is a star of Chamba

614
01:25:17,988 --> 01:25:21,424
This is my friend, confidante,
secretary, manager, partner...

615
01:25:21,448 --> 01:25:23,655
chief executive of this company,
Banerjee

616
01:25:24,238 --> 01:25:27,184
Mr. Sutar is here from Baroda
for the charity show

617
01:25:27,768 --> 01:25:29,724
Must deal with him right now

618
01:25:31,458 --> 01:25:36,532
Tell him we're booked all year.
One show will cost 5 million

619
01:25:37,068 --> 01:25:40,447
No charity. You pay up, we deliver

620
01:25:45,018 --> 01:25:50,263
All these charities are frauds,
raking it in. And from artistes...

621
01:25:50,238 --> 01:25:52,923
they expect concessions.
l told him off, Tarababu

622
01:25:53,348 --> 01:25:57,603
l'm a man of the 21st century.
Be it wedding, party or awards...

623
01:25:57,668 --> 01:25:59,795
pay up and l'll make music

624
01:26:01,038 --> 01:26:04,314
Tarababu... we artists
are priceless

625
01:26:09,538 --> 01:26:12,974
l'm glad to know
your regard for artistes

626
01:26:25,508 --> 01:26:30,161
Emotions hold you
and will forever hold you in poverty

627
01:26:30,858 --> 01:26:34,794
While you were, singing in the hills
l made millions out of your remixes

628
01:26:35,348 --> 01:26:39,773
Look, only your compositions

629
01:26:46,568 --> 01:26:50,834
What l'm offering Tarababu, is this.
Join us, compose songs for us

630
01:26:50,838 --> 01:26:53,853
Ms.. Manasi can sing,
she can model in our shows

631
01:26:53,948 --> 01:26:55,745
Begin life anew. Simple

632
01:27:00,678 --> 01:27:05,934
Give us a couple of days to think.
- Sure, think it over

633
01:27:05,968 --> 01:27:10,393
Accept or reject,
choice is yours

634
01:27:13,348 --> 01:27:18,103
This attitude won't help.
You belong in the 21st century

635
01:27:18,478 --> 01:27:21,094
Sitting at home,
cribbing and complaining won't do

636
01:27:21,838 --> 01:27:28,232
You've heard what language
today's men use. Use your brains

637
01:27:28,898 --> 01:27:32,493
What gain returning to Chamba?
Will you make a mockery of yourself?

638
01:27:32,668 --> 01:27:36,923
2 cousins waiting to wed. But no cash.
Tara's school is debt-ridden

639
01:27:37,318 --> 01:27:41,743
As for you, what about your life?

640
01:27:46,938 --> 01:27:55,141
l've no idea of your past sorrows.
But success is going to be painful

641
01:27:55,588 --> 01:27:57,886
You seem to have had
your share of suffering?

642
01:28:02,168 --> 01:28:05,774
l have suffered. Quite alike
the Hindi film hero...

643
01:28:05,788 --> 01:28:08,154
who suffers all his childhood
after his father deserts his mother

644
01:28:08,898 --> 01:28:13,483
My mother turned a seamstress to give
me an education. Gave me music too

645
01:28:14,188 --> 01:28:16,975
And then...
she died.

646
01:28:17,558 --> 01:28:21,494
l'm left an orphan.
The same... same sad story

647
01:28:22,688 --> 01:28:24,644
Mother

648
01:28:25,568 --> 01:28:27,866
But she left me with some
principles from the 20th century

649
01:28:28,298 --> 01:28:34,294
Here, 20th century principles.
Sacrifice is supreme

650
01:28:34,648 --> 01:28:38,254
Do your good deeds, your duty
without expectation of any reward

651
01:28:38,658 --> 01:28:42,264
For 5 years after graduating,
l clung on to these ideals

652
01:28:42,498 --> 01:28:46,104
And what outcome? l starved

653
01:28:46,348 --> 01:28:52,423
On stage, l played this rattle.
And Banerjee was a photographer

654
01:28:53,408 --> 01:28:59,301
Then life took a new turn.
We met Uncle Jaidev

655
01:28:59,818 --> 01:29:02,434
He gave us these 7 commandments
for the 21st century

656
01:29:04,788 --> 01:29:10,681
He said son, forget the old ideals.
Become the modern 21st century man

657
01:29:11,828 --> 01:29:15,594
First commandment,
love is a matter of give and take

658
01:29:15,838 --> 01:29:17,794
Give and take

659
01:29:17,918 --> 01:29:20,375
First do good to yourself,
others come later

660
01:29:20,648 --> 01:29:22,604
Me first

661
01:29:22,888 --> 01:29:25,345
Anything done without regard
to outcome is useless

662
01:29:25,458 --> 01:29:28,347
What is gain? How much profit?
What's the result?

663
01:29:29,078 --> 01:29:32,195
Enterprise is more necessary
than integrity. Business

664
01:29:33,408 --> 01:29:38,163
Envy is essential for winning
in competition. Jealousy

665
01:29:38,698 --> 01:29:43,123
Avarice is the prerequisite
for riches. Greed

666
01:29:44,308 --> 01:29:50,201
One-upmanship is essential for growth.
Cut them to size

667
01:29:52,488 --> 01:29:57,744
7 years of abiding by the commandments
has turned me into a Vikrant Kapoor

668
01:29:57,938 --> 01:30:02,363
You mean you became practical.
- Here in Mumbai...

669
01:30:02,358 --> 01:30:06,203
showmanship is everything

670
01:30:06,278 --> 01:30:12,012
Laurels make for publicity,
window-dressing is marketing

671
01:30:12,368 --> 01:30:18,113
You will see where we take Manasi.
- But only if she passes the test

672
01:30:18,618 --> 01:30:25,012
Kapoor, tell her about the contract.
- First, auditions. A song and a video

673
01:30:25,768 --> 01:30:28,555
What's the second condition?
- Condition Two...

674
01:30:28,588 --> 01:30:32,263
during the 3-year contract period,
you may not marry

675
01:30:32,658 --> 01:30:34,956
What...?
- No marriage, no friendships

676
01:30:34,998 --> 01:30:39,344
No love, no romance.
You see Ms. Manasi...

677
01:30:39,938 --> 01:30:43,317
Emotions are what we sell,
not what we buy

678
01:30:47,088 --> 01:30:51,843
Manav, at least hear Deep Mohan out.
- Whatever he might have to say...

679
01:30:52,208 --> 01:30:57,282
the household staff told me everything.
Aunt Shaku is at fault

680
01:30:57,658 --> 01:31:04,052
And the issue is, our civility.
- You'll teach us civilised behaviour?

681
01:31:04,718 --> 01:31:12,750
Certainly. What noblesse oblige behooves
you must learn

682
01:31:15,138 --> 01:31:20,053
The Tarababu whom you feted like a king
in Chamba was made to sit with the dogs

683
01:31:20,588 --> 01:31:24,615
The one you lauded as the priest of
the arts was called slave to wealth

684
01:31:26,778 --> 01:31:29,076
9 hours Grannie!
For 9 hours...

685
01:31:29,118 --> 01:31:33,942
father and daughter sat in the sun.
After such humiliation...

686
01:31:34,148 --> 01:31:38,084
can anyone contain his indignation?
- Manav, what is your point?

687
01:31:38,638 --> 01:31:46,181
Day after, Daddy returns from London.
You will make a clean breast of this

688
01:31:47,618 --> 01:31:52,203
Am l to tell my brother that he must
put up with someone who slapped him?

689
01:32:23,138 --> 01:32:27,563
lf breaking glass or raising voice
makes truth...

690
01:32:28,758 --> 01:32:33,832
then l have broken 7 glasses.
Makes me 7 times more righteous?

691
01:32:35,958 --> 01:32:42,522
Let me explain the real issue.
A 21 year old blindly in love...

692
01:32:42,848 --> 01:32:49,242
behaves like this, because he is bent
upon mending his fate

693
01:32:49,198 --> 01:32:53,862
And that of his family.
- Our destinies...

694
01:32:53,848 --> 01:32:58,831
we won't let you play with.
- lt is a changed fate already

695
01:33:03,208 --> 01:33:08,123
Your Manav now belongs to another.
Take a look if you'd like

696
01:33:10,428 --> 01:33:14,524
Manav's Manasi. She will enter
this family as a bride

697
01:33:16,038 --> 01:33:20,395
And together we will pose for
a family portrait

698
01:33:21,908 --> 01:33:24,024
That's a promise

699
01:33:25,588 --> 01:33:27,556
To you

700
01:33:27,998 --> 01:33:29,465
you

701
01:33:29,698 --> 01:33:31,563
and you

702
01:33:33,928 --> 01:33:35,884
Grannie, may l leave?

703
01:33:49,578 --> 01:33:53,241
Oh love...

704
01:33:56,058 --> 01:34:00,813
l understand it now...
l know the feeling

705
01:34:08,878 --> 01:34:10,823
When you never knew,
you were confused

706
01:34:10,948 --> 01:34:14,384
Now you know, your plight
is no more

707
01:34:14,638 --> 01:34:18,995
Yes, now l know

708
01:34:20,028 --> 01:34:23,794
And l know too

709
01:34:24,508 --> 01:34:28,126
lt's love, it's passion, desire

710
01:34:29,808 --> 01:34:34,563
She has it. She's good.
- Yes, get her to sign the contract

711
01:34:42,628 --> 01:34:43,777
Hey...

712
01:34:44,558 --> 01:34:47,493
Man, l'm talking to you. You're
getting in my heroine's way

713
01:34:47,858 --> 01:34:49,814
Move, l'm talking to you

714
01:34:50,488 --> 01:34:52,444
Some new hero

715
01:34:54,018 --> 01:35:00,082
Mister, we're working.
Please step aside

716
01:35:00,108 --> 01:35:05,182
Look, l must meet Manasi.
- Manasi? Do you know her?

717
01:35:06,518 --> 01:35:09,794
Yes, closely.
- How is she related to you?

718
01:35:11,328 --> 01:35:15,196
Lover.
- What...?

719
01:35:24,088 --> 01:35:26,534
One minute

720
01:35:32,428 --> 01:35:36,853
You see that boy? Wants to see you.
Says, you're his lover

721
01:35:38,518 --> 01:35:41,954
No sir. l'm nobody's lover
and l don't want to see him

722
01:35:43,008 --> 01:35:44,964
Shall l tell him off?
- Yes sir

723
01:35:50,048 --> 01:35:55,941
Brother, she doesn't want to see you,
doesn't even know you

724
01:35:55,918 --> 01:35:58,273
Nor is she your beloved,
understand?

725
01:36:01,588 --> 01:36:03,556
l got to see her

726
01:36:06,558 --> 01:36:13,612
After shooting. l'm being a gentleman.
Maybe you should reciprocate? Please...

727
01:36:13,938 --> 01:36:16,725
Let us work. Please

728
01:36:33,178 --> 01:36:34,315
Manasi, stop

729
01:36:40,388 --> 01:36:42,344
l can understand your anguish

730
01:36:44,878 --> 01:36:46,834
My mistake

731
01:36:49,368 --> 01:36:55,113
Now that l know the truth
l respect you even more

732
01:36:56,098 --> 01:36:58,885
Do you know why?
Because...

733
01:37:01,228 --> 01:37:07,303
a girl who will sacrifice her love
for the sake of her father's honour...

734
01:37:07,798 --> 01:37:12,497
will make an ideal wife,
someone a man will treasure

735
01:37:13,828 --> 01:37:15,466
l'm here to apologise

736
01:37:17,518 --> 01:37:20,134
Your father should be the one
to apologise. To my father

737
01:37:20,498 --> 01:37:23,513
Why? My father was slapped

738
01:37:24,408 --> 01:37:27,525
No, that's wrong.
Absolutely wrong

739
01:37:28,418 --> 01:37:31,683
l respect my father
just as you respect your Baba

740
01:37:34,498 --> 01:37:39,902
lt's done! Vikrant wants the contract
signed today. lt's an auspicious day

741
01:37:40,268 --> 01:37:42,236
l've read the contract.
Just sign it

742
01:37:44,438 --> 01:37:48,704
For 3 years,
you are Vikrant's heroine

743
01:37:51,018 --> 01:37:52,326
Sign here

744
01:38:11,948 --> 01:38:17,523
These are what you threw away
l'll string the pearls again

745
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:20,964
You will wear it again

746
01:38:29,428 --> 01:38:33,194
lf God be within me,
if l am honest...

747
01:38:35,998 --> 01:38:38,944
one day, you will come running
into my arms

748
01:38:41,128 --> 01:38:42,595
You...

749
01:38:44,018 --> 01:38:45,485
will

750
01:38:53,478 --> 01:38:55,434
Brother...

751
01:38:58,768 --> 01:39:01,885
So, met her?
- Yes

752
01:39:02,448 --> 01:39:05,349
Decision taken?
- Yes

753
01:39:05,438 --> 01:39:09,693
What?
- Signed for you, rescinded me

754
01:39:10,548 --> 01:39:14,325
Turned you down?
- Yes, she turned me down

755
01:39:17,608 --> 01:39:21,544
Friend, l don't know your story
but l know this

756
01:39:22,098 --> 01:39:24,054
ln the world of stardom...

757
01:39:24,498 --> 01:39:28,923
stars are hung on skies.
Stars in the sky...

758
01:39:29,728 --> 01:39:33,391
never come down to earth.
You are beyond reality, my friend

759
01:39:33,958 --> 01:39:41,012
You probably don't know her. l do.
She will come, she'll come to me

760
01:39:41,498 --> 01:39:45,912
And you will be the one
who sends her to me

761
01:39:47,428 --> 01:39:49,384
Me..?
- You

762
01:39:51,278 --> 01:39:55,863
l'm a businessman. Pure businessman.
- As a businessman you will...

763
01:39:55,858 --> 01:40:01,501
you'll send her to me, for sure.
- One thing, l like your confidence

764
01:40:34,178 --> 01:40:39,923
Whatever you told Deep... is it true?
- Absolutely

765
01:40:41,388 --> 01:40:46,303
They humiliated Tarababu and Manasi.
That was wrong

766
01:40:47,418 --> 01:40:50,581
That is why you were humiliated.
That too was wrong

767
01:40:51,478 --> 01:40:52,945
But... it is also true..

768
01:40:54,528 --> 01:40:55,665
Yes, carry on

769
01:40:57,248 --> 01:41:02,117
l love Manasi.
l've promised l'll marry her

770
01:41:06,968 --> 01:41:12,543
So, now what? Will you leave home?
Will you bring me to disgrace?

771
01:41:14,178 --> 01:41:19,753
No... that will never happen.
Something that sullies...

772
01:41:19,728 --> 01:41:24,210
your family or your name...
l will never do

773
01:41:25,078 --> 01:41:28,024
No scenes, no pettiness,
no violence

774
01:41:30,048 --> 01:41:34,155
Neither will l leave you
nor will l elope with Manasi

775
01:41:36,628 --> 01:41:37,925
That is my promise to you

776
01:41:41,438 --> 01:41:45,852
lf l refuse to give my consent
to your marriage to Manasi...?

777
01:41:48,808 --> 01:41:50,764
You won't do that

778
01:41:55,218 --> 01:42:00,406
ln the design of your schemes
l fell for Manasi. The love grew

779
01:42:01,888 --> 01:42:05,984
Only difference, your regard
for Tarababu was business

780
01:42:06,538 --> 01:42:10,634
My love for Manasi is humane,
as between man and woman

781
01:42:11,028 --> 01:42:17,103
This won't happen.
Manasi will not enter this house

782
01:42:23,058 --> 01:42:29,122
Very well, if my love is a sham,
she will never come

783
01:42:31,858 --> 01:42:37,114
But if God be within me,
if l am honest...

784
01:42:38,108 --> 01:42:43,512
if my love is true, you yourself
will bring Manasi to this house

785
01:42:45,808 --> 01:42:47,275
You

786
01:43:03,698 --> 01:43:06,644
Not anymore...

787
01:43:08,508 --> 01:43:10,806
No more, my love...

788
01:43:14,598 --> 01:43:20,002
l can take it no more

789
01:43:26,948 --> 01:43:30,065
The nightingale sings
in the forests...

790
01:43:55,578 --> 01:43:57,705
Not even if there be fire...

791
01:43:57,988 --> 01:44:00,104
not even for fear of venom...

792
01:44:00,388 --> 01:44:02,515
not even if the skies fall...

793
01:44:02,628 --> 01:44:04,926
come what may...

794
01:44:05,298 --> 01:44:09,450
anguish in my broken heart
is unbearable

795
01:44:35,008 --> 01:44:36,964
Come now, my beloved

796
01:45:23,358 --> 01:45:26,794
Even death can't kill love

797
01:45:27,848 --> 01:45:31,614
Without love, there's no life

798
01:45:32,338 --> 01:45:34,636
ln every passing moment...

799
01:45:34,898 --> 01:45:37,196
the heartache still remains

800
01:45:37,308 --> 01:45:39,754
Even if all is forgotten...

801
01:45:40,028 --> 01:45:42,155
some memories still remain

802
01:45:42,368 --> 01:45:46,862
Like a plant withering
with weeds...

803
01:45:47,178 --> 01:45:49,385
still in hope for an Eden...

804
01:45:49,488 --> 01:45:51,604
engulfed in thorns...

805
01:45:52,048 --> 01:45:54,164
now no medicine,
no prayer can save you...

806
01:45:54,288 --> 01:45:56,586
from this affliction...

807
01:46:28,918 --> 01:46:30,226
Love

808
01:46:34,688 --> 01:46:38,294
Love is unfaithful

809
01:46:39,018 --> 01:46:43,114
But lonely is a loveless life

810
01:46:43,988 --> 01:46:48,675
Beware, never give your heart,
yet your heart you will lose

811
01:46:48,888 --> 01:46:53,643
And you will awake in pleasure
your sleepless nights

812
01:46:53,698 --> 01:46:58,453
Your pain, your pleasure
belongs to someone else

813
01:46:58,608 --> 01:47:03,272
No use promises, no matter
how much you will try

814
01:47:03,318 --> 01:47:05,286
Oh but for love,
this would...

815
01:47:05,338 --> 01:47:07,545
become a world of ascetics

816
01:47:08,938 --> 01:47:10,894
Come to me...love

817
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:46,605
Come fire...venom

818
01:47:47,498 --> 01:47:48,795
falling skies

819
01:47:49,418 --> 01:47:51,374
apocalypse

820
01:47:52,948 --> 01:47:54,904
can't erase...

821
01:47:55,828 --> 01:47:57,796
the anguish...

822
01:47:57,848 --> 01:48:02,512
in my broken heart

823
01:48:13,948 --> 01:48:16,735
Extra-ordinary success story
an extra-ordinary girl

824
01:48:16,828 --> 01:48:22,084
Manasi Shankar, whom you will meet
at the MTV party tonight

825
01:48:27,258 --> 01:48:31,183
Our search of a star,
ends right here

826
01:48:31,418 --> 01:48:35,354
Because we have Manasi, the winner
of the MTV viewers choice

827
01:48:35,428 --> 01:48:40,013
5 minutes into my first meeting
with Manasi, l knew...

828
01:48:40,238 --> 01:48:42,297
she'd become the world's
biggest star

829
01:48:49,478 --> 01:48:55,212
l used to watch MTV but l never dreamt
l'd top the MTV charts

830
01:48:55,248 --> 01:49:00,003
What were your dreams about?
- That was another dream

831
01:49:18,638 --> 01:49:22,244
Being honoured by MTV
is really exciting, l'm thrilled

832
01:49:22,488 --> 01:49:25,275
Blood in my veins is pumping
twice as fast. Twice

833
01:49:27,618 --> 01:49:29,574
Manav is here

834
01:49:34,828 --> 01:49:41,336
l'm very excited! Blood in my veins
is pumping six times as fast. Six

835
01:49:43,588 --> 01:49:45,544
Brother...

836
01:49:47,118 --> 01:49:49,234
You... here?
- Yes, right here

837
01:49:49,838 --> 01:49:53,274
How come...?
- Just like you came

838
01:49:54,328 --> 01:49:58,913
Are you a winner too?
- Not yet but maybe later...?

839
01:49:59,138 --> 01:50:02,073
Can l have two minutes?
- Sure

840
01:50:03,948 --> 01:50:09,204
Frankly, l admire you.
- l admire you too

841
01:50:12,128 --> 01:50:18,351
But Your Highness, Your Majesty...
what brings the jilted lover here?

842
01:50:19,338 --> 01:50:24,253
Grand party! MTV is honouring us.
You feel like ruining it?

843
01:50:25,268 --> 01:50:27,566
Notjilted, sir.
l am her lover

844
01:50:30,238 --> 01:50:32,854
Whose?
- Hers

845
01:50:37,868 --> 01:50:42,783
Look, this is a business party.
lt's the first day of her success

846
01:50:42,838 --> 01:50:43,987
That's why l'm here

847
01:50:46,138 --> 01:50:49,323
Like a gentleman, l will suggest
that you might slip away

848
01:50:53,248 --> 01:50:57,833
l told you. Manasi belongs to me.
l belong to Manasi, so l'm here

849
01:50:58,058 --> 01:51:01,334
But she refuses to
acknowledge you

850
01:51:01,908 --> 01:51:05,184
Sir! She's in a temper!
ln love, there are fights

851
01:51:08,158 --> 01:51:12,254
So you're convinced
that she will return to you?

852
01:51:14,728 --> 01:51:16,855
And you will send her to me

853
01:51:21,148 --> 01:51:23,764
He is crazy, show him out

854
01:51:24,188 --> 01:51:25,826
Ladies and gentlemen...

855
01:51:29,478 --> 01:51:32,424
Tonight is for Manasi Shankar

856
01:51:36,468 --> 01:51:43,681
Tonight's Chief Guest is the young,
dashing, handsome... Mr. Manav Mehta

857
01:52:04,368 --> 01:52:07,974
Sole heir to the Mehta and Mehta
fortunes, he has won...

858
01:52:07,958 --> 01:52:10,995
the maximum college awards
while in London...

859
01:52:11,258 --> 01:52:13,715
not only in lndian music but
in lndian literature

860
01:52:25,688 --> 01:52:29,624
He is MTV's Chief Guest.
- Where are the drinks?

861
01:52:38,278 --> 01:52:42,374
You don't want to be this.
You are Manav-si

862
01:52:45,978 --> 01:52:49,744
Tell me you don't love me

863
01:52:54,948 --> 01:52:56,256
No

864
01:52:58,958 --> 01:53:00,926
Give up this sham of a life.

865
01:53:03,928 --> 01:53:05,896
Shall l leave?

866
01:53:06,978 --> 01:53:08,934
l'll wait for you

867
01:53:24,928 --> 01:53:27,874
My blood is pumping
twelve times faster

868
01:53:35,288 --> 01:53:37,244
Meter reading

869
01:53:38,978 --> 01:53:42,914
Your red-cravat was saying...
- l don't want to hear

870
01:53:56,448 --> 01:53:59,246
Whatever you say,
there's something about him

871
01:54:09,908 --> 01:54:17,280
Prabha told me all about Manav.
You should make friends with him

872
01:54:18,078 --> 01:54:22,014
What's the harm? ln a romance
the parents always play villain

873
01:54:22,408 --> 01:54:25,206
He's in love with you

874
01:54:26,098 --> 01:54:27,998
Enough

875
01:54:28,758 --> 01:54:33,843
At this point l must remind you that
according to your contract...

876
01:54:34,208 --> 01:54:36,176
no artiste working for your company
has the right...

877
01:54:36,458 --> 01:54:39,894
to make friends, fall in love
or get married

878
01:54:40,618 --> 01:54:46,033
For my work and my career, this
banal conversation is an aberration

879
01:54:47,198 --> 01:54:52,943
l don't like working like this!
l don't want to work here

880
01:55:04,668 --> 01:55:07,614
She's a wounded tigress.
Why needle her?

881
01:55:09,798 --> 01:55:13,404
You only find arrogant girls,
not girls who have self respect

882
01:55:20,958 --> 01:55:22,926
Please give the phone to Manasi

883
01:55:25,038 --> 01:55:29,452
Manasi... call for you.
From Vikrant's studio

884
01:55:32,568 --> 01:55:35,014
Tell him l don't want to work

885
01:55:40,578 --> 01:55:42,876
l don't get you

886
01:55:43,148 --> 01:55:47,733
We're launching a new bra.
Like this

887
01:55:47,958 --> 01:55:50,882
And you want a beautiful model
to advertise this bra

888
01:55:50,988 --> 01:55:53,286
From us?
- Yes

889
01:55:53,398 --> 01:55:57,164
And you only want Manasi?
- Yes

890
01:55:57,568 --> 01:55:59,684
And she will be on hoardings
all over the city?

891
01:55:59,968 --> 01:56:01,117
Right

892
01:56:04,298 --> 01:56:08,564
We can pay you the asking price.
50 million, 100 million...?

893
01:56:11,028 --> 01:56:16,284
And you know that Manasi is a singer?
- Yes

894
01:56:16,738 --> 01:56:19,593
And she's a dancer.
- Yes

895
01:56:20,168 --> 01:56:26,494
She's an artiste. A star.
- Stars will strip for the money.

896
01:56:28,438 --> 01:56:30,406
True. And the money is nice

897
01:56:31,488 --> 01:56:36,243
Banerjee... you're such a fool!
You get such foolish clients

898
01:56:36,298 --> 01:56:38,425
They don't realise Manasi
comes from a good family

899
01:56:38,698 --> 01:56:40,666
She won't do this kind
of modeling

900
01:56:40,788 --> 01:56:42,915
Either you're a fool
or they are

901
01:56:45,918 --> 01:56:47,226
Excuse Mr. Kapoor...

902
01:56:47,358 --> 01:56:49,656
Nowadays girls from good backgrounds
are also into modeling

903
01:56:50,888 --> 01:56:55,643
Then my advice to you is, you have
a far better model than Manasi...

904
01:56:55,598 --> 01:56:56,906
sitting right next to you

905
01:56:58,098 --> 01:56:59,736
What?
- Mr. Kapoor...

906
01:57:00,028 --> 01:57:04,124
She's pretty, healthy.
She looks great

907
01:57:06,118 --> 01:57:09,235
They're the Mehta family...
- l know

908
01:57:09,648 --> 01:57:12,765
lf you belong to a respectable family
you learn how to respect others

909
01:57:13,328 --> 01:57:15,455
You deal with these scoundrels.
l'm busy

910
01:57:18,298 --> 01:57:20,858
We sell art
not the modesty of girls

911
01:57:29,458 --> 01:57:32,564
l don't think you're
any judge of men

912
01:57:33,138 --> 01:57:35,436
Your rights and wrongs
are all mixed up

913
01:57:44,518 --> 01:57:49,922
Tarababu has sent his composition.
- Why didn't he come?

914
01:57:50,288 --> 01:57:54,065
He's not well.
- And Manasi..?

915
01:57:54,138 --> 01:57:58,723
She refused to come.
l've called her 6 times in 4 days

916
01:58:00,548 --> 01:58:06,123
But she doesn't want to come?
You're such a fool! You're my enemy

917
01:58:06,258 --> 01:58:09,113
You love to humiliate me!
- What have l done?

918
01:58:09,208 --> 01:58:12,154
Why did you call her 6 times?

919
01:58:13,698 --> 01:58:15,654
Don't you know what
Vikrant Kapoor is?

920
01:58:18,028 --> 01:58:20,246
Girls like her
have come and gone

921
01:58:21,328 --> 01:58:25,105
A few smiles and accolades
and she thinks she's Miss World?

922
01:58:25,178 --> 01:58:27,305
One award and she thinks
she is a star

923
01:58:27,578 --> 01:58:30,695
Tell Tarababu
l don't want his song

924
01:58:41,848 --> 01:58:43,804
So it hurts?

925
01:58:45,218 --> 01:58:51,282
Who can hurt me? Who?
l'm tough! Tough!

926
01:58:51,788 --> 01:58:57,044
You don't appear to be as tough...?
- Where do you find me weak?

927
01:58:57,558 --> 01:59:00,174
ln there. Your heart
- What do you mean... heart?

928
01:59:00,928 --> 01:59:05,024
From the heart. For the first time
you spoke from your heart

929
01:59:05,898 --> 01:59:09,823
Really, you miss Manasi, don't you?
- Don't bore me. Go away

930
01:59:09,838 --> 01:59:12,511
What harm being honest?
- Go away

931
01:59:17,368 --> 01:59:18,835
You are missing her

932
01:59:30,668 --> 01:59:34,274
What happened?
- What should never happen

933
01:59:34,518 --> 01:59:37,794
Love?
- No, hatred

934
01:59:37,888 --> 01:59:40,504
Hatred?
- No song today?

935
01:59:40,768 --> 01:59:46,843
Sorry folks.
Today's session... cancelled

936
01:59:55,838 --> 01:59:56,987
l am... Manasi

937
02:00:04,178 --> 02:00:06,794
What you did wasn't right.
- l know

938
02:00:14,378 --> 02:00:16,676
l want to be back.
- l'll wait for you

939
02:00:22,228 --> 02:00:25,834
l don't know what happened
inside my heart

940
02:00:26,718 --> 02:00:30,654
To love, l drank

941
02:00:31,368 --> 02:00:36,283
l have lived...
l drank to love

942
02:00:49,798 --> 02:00:53,074
O' wanderer...

943
02:01:02,458 --> 02:01:05,734
To love, l drank...

944
02:01:09,188 --> 02:01:12,407
in a moment, ages l have lived

945
02:01:28,848 --> 02:01:32,124
Drunken in ecstasy...

946
02:01:32,218 --> 02:01:40,250
in moments, a life in centuries
lived, drunk

947
02:01:45,678 --> 02:01:48,294
O wanderer...

948
02:02:03,478 --> 02:02:06,595
when you drank
the potion of love...

949
02:02:06,678 --> 02:02:10,068
what happened
inside your heart?

950
02:02:18,318 --> 02:02:24,882
Ecstasy and lifetimes in centuries
l have lived in a moment's time

951
02:02:25,058 --> 02:02:27,993
l have drunk...

952
02:02:28,578 --> 02:02:30,534
l have lived... here

953
02:03:06,178 --> 02:03:12,253
Why this obsession?
Why infect yourself?

954
02:03:19,008 --> 02:03:25,891
l saw her in ecstasy,
whipping up a frenzy

955
02:03:35,778 --> 02:03:38,793
My heart went out to her...

956
02:03:39,048 --> 02:03:47,080
and l was drunken in love

957
02:04:33,638 --> 02:04:38,063
Then l fell in love
and l renounced the world...

958
02:04:39,898 --> 02:04:42,833
like a hermit

959
02:04:43,098 --> 02:04:49,822
But he never got to know,
it never touched his heart

960
02:04:53,038 --> 02:04:59,273
l never could cry out my pain,
did it never touch your heart?

961
02:04:59,648 --> 02:05:02,890
ln ecstasy l'm drunken

962
02:05:02,978 --> 02:05:06,254
ln a moment, many centuries
l have lived

963
02:05:06,508 --> 02:05:09,625
l have drunk

964
02:05:09,708 --> 02:05:11,676
l have lived

965
02:05:29,588 --> 02:05:32,876
l have wandered

966
02:05:47,228 --> 02:05:50,493
Manav just walked out and went
to live in Dad's cottage

967
02:05:50,578 --> 02:05:52,375
Let him be.
- Wonderful

968
02:05:52,508 --> 02:05:55,124
We'll name the cottage
Romeo's lair

969
02:06:03,508 --> 02:06:07,763
What do you want to say?
- Vikrant likes Manasi

970
02:06:08,318 --> 02:06:11,253
He had this delivered
through Banerjee

971
02:06:11,838 --> 02:06:16,104
What does this mean?
- He's asking for her hand

972
02:06:16,648 --> 02:06:18,616
- But...
- No buts!

973
02:06:18,738 --> 02:06:21,525
You don't find
eligible bachelors like Vikrant

974
02:06:21,558 --> 02:06:25,403
Prabha...
- At heart Vikrant is simple

975
02:06:25,408 --> 02:06:28,423
Like us. Manasi will be
very happy with him

976
02:06:28,678 --> 02:06:31,294
He will give her all his love,
l guarantee

977
02:06:31,398 --> 02:06:34,344
But why in a hurry...?
- Up to you

978
02:06:34,928 --> 02:06:37,374
lf you want Manasi to remain
a spinster, so be it

979
02:06:37,808 --> 02:06:40,424
You want to turn away good fortune,
then so be it

980
02:06:41,338 --> 02:06:45,763
Think of Manasi. Once she's married,
she'll forget all her sorrows

981
02:06:47,748 --> 02:06:54,642
What are you saying Baba?
- l let you decide your fate, didn't l?

982
02:06:55,768 --> 02:07:02,753
This is your turn to obey me.
This is your success, not mine

983
02:07:04,198 --> 02:07:08,794
Success for a father lies in finding
a suitable boy for his daughter

984
02:07:11,418 --> 02:07:17,482
Look my dear... who knows
when life will cheat me?

985
02:07:18,308 --> 02:07:23,382
Before l die l want to see
you married to a good boy

986
02:07:25,198 --> 02:07:30,101
Don't... don't turn me down.
For my sake

987
02:07:33,688 --> 02:07:36,964
Yes, l sent the proposal
through Banerjee

988
02:07:38,018 --> 02:07:42,114
Will you really
be able to love me?

989
02:08:02,318 --> 02:08:06,914
Do you know some people fall
in love and get married?

990
02:08:07,448 --> 02:08:10,394
And some get married
and fall in love

991
02:08:10,658 --> 02:08:12,614
Second category. Second category?

992
02:08:39,038 --> 02:08:41,973
Has she gone away from me?

993
02:08:42,718 --> 02:08:47,974
Which path has she taken?

994
02:08:49,618 --> 02:08:54,305
Every path...

995
02:08:55,488 --> 02:09:00,562
...leads to my heart

996
02:09:27,378 --> 02:09:29,494
You aren't with me...

997
02:09:32,988 --> 02:09:37,243
maybe you aren't with me,
but that's a different story

998
02:09:42,928 --> 02:09:44,884
Within me...

999
02:09:48,148 --> 02:09:52,414
you are within me

1000
02:11:07,278 --> 02:11:11,533
You are away,
but we aren't separated

1001
02:11:12,568 --> 02:11:16,993
You're angry with me...
but you aren't unfaithful

1002
02:11:28,278 --> 02:11:32,863
Your hand
l hold in mine

1003
02:11:41,008 --> 02:11:45,308
You are with me

1004
02:12:13,268 --> 02:12:16,704
Fortunate are those that die
at the hands of their beloved

1005
02:12:16,948 --> 02:12:18,916
You seem very happy?
- Yes

1006
02:12:19,358 --> 02:12:22,475
Sanjay Prabhu from lndia's top
company BPL just called me

1007
02:12:22,718 --> 02:12:27,314
He says they want to
send us to Canada

1008
02:12:27,368 --> 02:12:30,144
For MTV lnternational Awards.
- MTV?

1009
02:12:30,248 --> 02:12:33,684
Yes. You've brought me
so much of luck

1010
02:12:44,028 --> 02:12:46,474
What? Fire?

1011
02:13:06,148 --> 02:13:08,605
You can't go in there!
- lt's my cottage on fire

1012
02:13:08,878 --> 02:13:10,834
l said, you can't

1013
02:13:12,728 --> 02:13:15,276
No, son. You can't go ahead.
- But my belongings...

1014
02:13:15,318 --> 02:13:17,684
What a Romeo! That's a no-go

1015
02:13:25,648 --> 02:13:28,924
That's my cottage! There are
very precious things inside

1016
02:13:29,018 --> 02:13:32,613
Forget this! Come with me.
- We have orders

1017
02:13:33,498 --> 02:13:38,094
Damn your cottage! l got to save
goods worth millions in the go down

1018
02:13:40,238 --> 02:13:41,216
Carry on

1019
02:15:08,918 --> 02:15:10,545
l'm absolutely fine

1020
02:15:10,678 --> 02:15:15,433
Just burnt my hand a little.
The rest is safe

1021
02:15:16,128 --> 02:15:20,713
Had no idea that the fire
would be flaming inside

1022
02:15:21,418 --> 02:15:23,545
Everybody else was trying
to save the go down

1023
02:15:24,308 --> 02:15:26,264
l too had a few precious things

1024
02:15:26,548 --> 02:15:31,303
My violin, the digital camera
you gave me, my computer

1025
02:15:39,058 --> 02:15:43,813
Doctor says l can be home tomorrow
for tennis

1026
02:15:44,828 --> 02:15:48,753
l want a game of tennis with you.
Haven't played tennis with you in ages

1027
02:16:04,048 --> 02:16:06,278
One who isn't accustomed
to lying...

1028
02:16:07,518 --> 02:16:09,816
should never lie

1029
02:16:21,778 --> 02:16:23,746
l am your daddy

1030
02:16:39,898 --> 02:16:42,844
What is it?
- You can't enter without signing

1031
02:16:42,948 --> 02:16:47,044
l'm going in! You can't stop me.
- Listen...

1032
02:16:48,558 --> 02:16:51,675
He came in without authorisation.
He didn't even sign the register

1033
02:16:54,968 --> 02:16:56,924
Says he's your friend

1034
02:16:59,718 --> 02:17:01,743
You may go

1035
02:17:02,028 --> 02:17:04,417
He is our guest

1036
02:17:10,938 --> 02:17:13,384
Welcome, Jagmohan. Sit

1037
02:17:15,108 --> 02:17:19,363
Chhaya, get a cold drink
for our guest

1038
02:17:19,438 --> 02:17:20,416
Yes

1039
02:17:27,928 --> 02:17:31,364
Today is the day we worship
the Goddess of Knowledge

1040
02:17:33,368 --> 02:17:35,666
The Goddess of Knowledge, you know...?

1041
02:17:37,698 --> 02:17:39,654
Don't embarrass me, Tarababu

1042
02:17:42,348 --> 02:17:44,475
l'm here to apologise for my mistake

1043
02:17:46,518 --> 02:17:48,474
l come asking for my son's life

1044
02:17:49,878 --> 02:17:51,846
Manasi...

1045
02:17:55,178 --> 02:17:57,476
l come to ask for Manasi's hand...
- Don't say it

1046
02:17:58,538 --> 02:18:04,716
No Jagmohan! l stood at your door
asking for my daughter's life...

1047
02:18:05,688 --> 02:18:07,644
No... no

1048
02:18:08,738 --> 02:18:13,653
Little would you know how deeply
your deceit shocked my daughter

1049
02:18:15,308 --> 02:18:18,914
How many nights she cried
... how many nights?

1050
02:18:20,118 --> 02:18:22,074
Now...

1051
02:18:25,248 --> 02:18:27,204
now she belongs
to somebody else

1052
02:18:29,258 --> 02:18:32,864
Don't say that.
- That's the way it is, Jagmohan

1053
02:18:33,588 --> 02:18:36,523
She is away in Canada
with Vikrant Kapoor

1054
02:18:36,788 --> 02:18:39,086
They will get married
when they return next week

1055
02:18:39,358 --> 02:18:40,996
You understand?

1056
02:18:52,828 --> 02:18:56,594
Sky Dome! What a huge stadium!
Thousands of people

1057
02:18:56,828 --> 02:18:58,898
Singers from all countries
have come, Manasi

1058
02:18:59,498 --> 02:19:03,912
Big competition! What will happen?
Anyway, it'll be fun

1059
02:19:04,148 --> 02:19:06,935
Vikrant is confident that
you will win the first prize

1060
02:19:07,828 --> 02:19:13,073
Have you read about Manav Mehta?
- Are you sorry?

1061
02:19:13,908 --> 02:19:15,876
Get back to work

1062
02:19:16,798 --> 02:19:21,053
The son of London's wealthiest man
jumped into a raging fire...

1063
02:19:21,608 --> 02:19:24,543
to save a scarf
given by his beloved

1064
02:19:24,968 --> 02:19:27,095
Nobody knows
who the beloved is

1065
02:19:27,218 --> 02:19:31,803
Why are you going on and on?
- lt's in the papers!

1066
02:19:31,798 --> 02:19:34,813
l don't want to see!
You know l'm engaged

1067
02:19:35,398 --> 02:19:39,653
Engagement done and all is over?
Manav risked his life

1068
02:19:39,878 --> 02:19:47,102
You don't even shed a tear for him?
- This world has turned you to stone

1069
02:19:48,698 --> 02:19:52,964
Can't you make one phone call?
- lla please...

1070
02:19:53,828 --> 02:19:58,515
He loved you, truly.
- lla, Shanno, Vikrant is calling you

1071
02:20:32,728 --> 02:20:37,313
My love, may l make an appearance?
- One minute, please

1072
02:20:45,068 --> 02:20:49,004
You aren't ready?
The entire orchestra is waiting

1073
02:20:52,908 --> 02:20:56,196
ln tears, weren't you?
You were crying

1074
02:21:01,248 --> 02:21:03,204
Missing him...?

1075
02:21:07,338 --> 02:21:09,306
l know you love me

1076
02:21:12,148 --> 02:21:14,275
And l love you, right?

1077
02:21:19,048 --> 02:21:21,835
Let cheer the Coke.
Brighten up with a Coke

1078
02:21:36,358 --> 02:21:38,326
Love only grows

1079
02:21:39,568 --> 02:21:42,685
Drink.
Coke is sponsoring us. Drink

1080
02:21:44,058 --> 02:21:46,014
Drink Manasi

1081
02:21:46,458 --> 02:21:48,414
Look...

1082
02:21:49,188 --> 02:21:51,736
We got to win this
world competition

1083
02:21:52,488 --> 02:21:55,605
To win, one got to put heart and soul
into the song

1084
02:21:56,498 --> 02:21:58,454
Just concentrate on the song

1085
02:22:00,348 --> 02:22:01,645
Listen...

1086
02:22:04,028 --> 02:22:08,124
Can l sing a folk song from
my village for today's show?

1087
02:22:09,638 --> 02:22:15,383
Folk? But the orchestra is ready.
Another song... now?

1088
02:22:17,338 --> 02:22:22,742
You just said, to win, l got to put
heart and soul into the song

1089
02:22:32,878 --> 02:22:37,463
Manasi will make new music!
From her heart, from her soul

1090
02:22:43,138 --> 02:22:49,464
Promises l made
to someone l loved...

1091
02:22:53,978 --> 02:23:00,042
l have broken

1092
02:23:02,948 --> 02:23:07,214
But my heart, my life...

1093
02:23:08,398 --> 02:23:12,004
maybe l...

1094
02:23:14,178 --> 02:23:20,242
left behind

1095
02:23:54,028 --> 02:23:56,155
lf not for love...

1096
02:23:57,078 --> 02:23:59,694
what's left to live for?

1097
02:24:03,008 --> 02:24:07,433
lf not for love,
what's left to die for?

1098
02:24:25,598 --> 02:24:27,566
Love's sweet

1099
02:24:27,848 --> 02:24:29,804
And bittersweet

1100
02:24:30,088 --> 02:24:33,865
A promise to be kept,
yet so weak a chord...

1101
02:24:34,098 --> 02:24:35,406
Love

1102
02:25:00,648 --> 02:25:02,946
Before me...

1103
02:25:03,048 --> 02:25:05,016
upon this path...

1104
02:25:07,538 --> 02:25:12,293
many lovers have trod

1105
02:25:26,778 --> 02:25:31,693
Did the path lead to sea...

1106
02:25:37,778 --> 02:25:43,523
in which all was drowned?

1107
02:25:47,168 --> 02:25:51,150
The harshest of truths...
the worst of illusions...

1108
02:25:51,908 --> 02:25:55,639
promise most resolute...
yet the weakest ties...

1109
02:25:57,968 --> 02:26:00,084
without love

1110
02:27:06,998 --> 02:27:09,296
lf not for love
what's left to live for?

1111
02:27:11,808 --> 02:27:13,776
lf not for love,
what's left to die for?

1112
02:30:10,028 --> 02:30:12,826
Loads of congratulatory calls
coming in from lndia

1113
02:30:19,968 --> 02:30:22,914
Are you happy?
- Much

1114
02:30:26,538 --> 02:30:32,113
Last night, the tears while you sang,
made for a terrific touch

1115
02:30:35,358 --> 02:30:37,815
You had to let out
this venom that was Manav

1116
02:30:38,088 --> 02:30:40,044
l'm glad it happened
before we got married

1117
02:30:40,968 --> 02:30:44,574
Had it happened afterwards,
l would have been very hurt

1118
02:30:51,538 --> 02:30:54,974
Tomorrow we get married,
then the reception and then...

1119
02:30:55,388 --> 02:31:00,462
The BPL guys called. At the airport,
we'll get a grand reception

1120
02:31:00,518 --> 02:31:03,794
Tomorrow is going to be the best day
in my life! Best

1121
02:31:07,798 --> 02:31:10,198
You're about to become
Mrs. Vikrant Kapoor

1122
02:31:10,298 --> 02:31:13,244
Are you happy?
- Yes

1123
02:31:13,828 --> 02:31:15,784
ls everything all right?
Did Manav come here?

1124
02:31:15,908 --> 02:31:18,206
He came.
- What was he saying?

1125
02:31:18,318 --> 02:31:20,274
Wanted to meet Manasi.

1126
02:31:21,038 --> 02:31:23,006
Then...?
- He just vanished

1127
02:31:24,568 --> 02:31:28,174
Mr. Commissioner... l need security.
Strict security

1128
02:31:28,188 --> 02:31:29,985
Everything is arranged

1129
02:31:30,918 --> 02:31:33,853
Manasi isn't feeling well.
Can you please...?

1130
02:31:34,538 --> 02:31:38,213
Stage set. By 4 o'clock you'll be
married. Then, the reception at Leela

1131
02:31:38,608 --> 02:31:40,576
And Manav?
- lf he transpires...

1132
02:31:40,628 --> 02:31:44,143
we'll get him out of the way.
- Kill him, if need be

1133
02:31:44,798 --> 02:31:47,312
We'll have a great time together

1134
02:31:59,288 --> 02:32:01,415
Baba, Manasi is calling you.

1135
02:32:02,818 --> 02:32:04,774
Hold this

1136
02:32:07,148 --> 02:32:08,786
What is it?

1137
02:32:09,228 --> 02:32:11,196
What's going on?
- What...?

1138
02:32:11,318 --> 02:32:13,616
Whom are you socialising with?

1139
02:32:15,168 --> 02:32:22,381
l see. ln life, first we make friends.
Then we like them, then we have fights

1140
02:32:23,178 --> 02:32:28,195
An apology after a fight,
draws friends even closer

1141
02:32:29,518 --> 02:32:31,645
Baba, do you realise
what you're saying?

1142
02:32:32,238 --> 02:32:36,834
Jagmohan has come to bless you.
As my friend

1143
02:32:37,858 --> 02:32:39,814
Let's go in

1144
02:32:48,598 --> 02:32:51,874
Let it be, Tarababu.
l'll make a move

1145
02:32:52,438 --> 02:32:57,353
Forgive me, she...
- Apology...? No, never mind

1146
02:32:59,018 --> 02:33:00,974
Excuse me

1147
02:33:09,278 --> 02:33:12,554
Don't be afraid Manasi. l haven't
come to set your life on fire

1148
02:33:12,548 --> 02:33:13,958
l'm here to douse the fire

1149
02:33:15,368 --> 02:33:21,113
No, Manav. Not today.
- lt has to be today

1150
02:33:22,098 --> 02:33:24,817
l must wipe the make-up
from your sister's face

1151
02:33:25,888 --> 02:33:30,143
Manasi, l only come to tell you
a marriage is neither a contract

1152
02:33:30,118 --> 02:33:32,837
Nor a festivity! The festivities
are for the others

1153
02:33:33,898 --> 02:33:37,834
Marriage is a union of two souls,
two hearts, two people who will live...

1154
02:33:37,818 --> 02:33:40,366
to consummate their loves.
Until death, to part

1155
02:33:41,278 --> 02:33:45,703
By marrying Vikrant, you're deceiving
him the worst, and yourself

1156
02:33:45,928 --> 02:33:51,503
Three lives will be ruined!
You are marrying Vikrant

1157
02:33:51,468 --> 02:33:54,483
But Manav lives in your heart!
Only Manav

1158
02:33:55,388 --> 02:33:59,643
No! Nobody in my heart.
- You lie

1159
02:34:00,998 --> 02:34:03,614
ln every song of yours,
Manav lives

1160
02:34:04,518 --> 02:34:06,816
Manav is your first and last love

1161
02:34:09,198 --> 02:34:11,780
Mister, out.
- One minute

1162
02:34:12,688 --> 02:34:16,294
Look at you.
Crying

1163
02:34:17,178 --> 02:34:23,674
Those tears tell you what's happening
isn't true. Lovers die, love never dies

1164
02:34:24,008 --> 02:34:25,635
Outside, please.
- Forget it, Manav

1165
02:34:25,768 --> 02:34:27,895
l'm yours,
l will wait for you

1166
02:34:37,148 --> 02:34:39,446
Get a hold on yourself

1167
02:34:48,698 --> 02:34:51,815
How long will it take?
- At least an hour and a half

1168
02:35:15,148 --> 02:35:17,594
l'm feeling faint.
May l sit in the car?

1169
02:35:26,628 --> 02:35:30,553
l don't get this. A wedding in court
and religious rites too?

1170
02:35:31,758 --> 02:35:33,714
You won't get this

1171
02:35:34,478 --> 02:35:36,605
The music is lifeless. The end

1172
02:35:46,988 --> 02:35:52,062
What kind of security is this?
Do you see that man with the dog?

1173
02:35:52,588 --> 02:35:55,204
He is my enemy. He has a bomb
in his pocket

1174
02:35:55,628 --> 02:35:58,745
Human bomb... he will
blow up all of us

1175
02:36:00,278 --> 02:36:02,246
Wait a minute

1176
02:36:07,978 --> 02:36:10,765
Boy, don't make move.
- Am l moving?

1177
02:36:10,798 --> 02:36:12,754
l thought you would

1178
02:36:14,228 --> 02:36:16,776
Why did you think of marrying
in court before the ceremony?

1179
02:36:18,818 --> 02:36:22,743
Will it do if l tell
you tomorrow?

1180
02:36:23,788 --> 02:36:28,213
Ask me at the reception.
Right now l'm a bit tense

1181
02:36:32,598 --> 02:36:36,864
What happened?
- Nothing. He's one of Manasi's fans

1182
02:36:36,928 --> 02:36:41,513
Like normal fans. We found this
photo of Manasi in his pocket

1183
02:36:41,898 --> 02:36:43,206
Look

1184
02:36:43,828 --> 02:36:46,763
Unlike what you said, no bomb

1185
02:36:47,028 --> 02:36:52,603
He's different from other fans.
Arrest him

1186
02:36:57,768 --> 02:37:00,885
There has to be a reason.
l can't simply arrest him

1187
02:37:00,978 --> 02:37:02,445
You can't arrest him?
- l can't

1188
02:37:02,578 --> 02:37:04,057
You can't?
- l can't

1189
02:37:04,118 --> 02:37:07,793
Then join the dance.
Come on, dance

1190
02:37:16,948 --> 02:37:18,415
Brownie

1191
02:37:28,968 --> 02:37:30,913
This crowd has driven me crazy

1192
02:37:34,728 --> 02:37:37,344
How are you?
- Fine

1193
02:37:38,098 --> 02:37:43,502
He's here. The leech!
What does he want from us?

1194
02:37:46,918 --> 02:37:47,896
Brownie...

1195
02:37:57,658 --> 02:38:01,754
You know him?
- Manav's dog

1196
02:38:02,148 --> 02:38:07,222
You even care for Manav's dog?
So he sent his dog in his stead

1197
02:38:09,358 --> 02:38:10,336
Get lost

1198
02:38:11,858 --> 02:38:13,826
Go back to that rascal

1199
02:38:22,598 --> 02:38:25,396
My dog will die!
- Hold him

1200
02:38:27,728 --> 02:38:29,036
Let go

1201
02:38:39,438 --> 02:38:40,905
Bash him up

1202
02:38:57,388 --> 02:38:59,686
Sister! Let's go, please

1203
02:39:05,888 --> 02:39:08,504
Manav, your Brownie

1204
02:39:37,718 --> 02:39:41,814
lla, Shannu...
tell me something truthfully

1205
02:39:43,808 --> 02:39:45,275
Yes?

1206
02:39:45,728 --> 02:39:47,855
What did Manav tell Manasi
in the airport lounge?

1207
02:39:50,538 --> 02:39:52,506
Swear that by Manasi

1208
02:39:53,428 --> 02:39:59,003
He said,
Manasi might be marrying you,...

1209
02:39:59,838 --> 02:40:02,784
but only Manav lives in her heart

1210
02:40:05,928 --> 02:40:08,055
Look...

1211
02:40:15,228 --> 02:40:17,196
They're here too?

1212
02:40:20,038 --> 02:40:21,016
Next

1213
02:40:21,198 --> 02:40:24,110
How much longer?
- 3 are registered. Two couples left

1214
02:40:24,208 --> 02:40:28,144
Everything's in place,
police, security, the works

1215
02:40:28,158 --> 02:40:29,682
The international press
will be at the reception

1216
02:40:29,818 --> 02:40:34,243
Superstar Kappu
marries beauty queen Manasi

1217
02:40:37,838 --> 02:40:45,210
On Monday, take Lord Shiva's blessings.
You will always be successful in life

1218
02:40:45,368 --> 02:40:49,304
Sorry, l don't have a coin.
- Take this

1219
02:40:52,088 --> 02:40:55,524
May you marry the man after your heart,
may you always be happy

1220
02:41:00,428 --> 02:41:03,545
Almost done. The registrar
will call you in 5 minutes

1221
02:41:03,638 --> 02:41:07,165
l'll be there.
- Prabha, bring them in

1222
02:41:34,028 --> 02:41:36,644
ln 5 minutes, we'll be married.

1223
02:41:39,328 --> 02:41:41,284
Life's strange

1224
02:41:44,618 --> 02:41:48,714
Will you be honest?
Are you happy?

1225
02:41:50,388 --> 02:41:52,344
Yes, l'm happy.

1226
02:41:52,948 --> 02:41:55,246
Do you love me?
- What...?

1227
02:41:57,118 --> 02:42:01,384
Do you love me?
- What kind of a question is this?

1228
02:42:04,108 --> 02:42:10,183
That act of giving alms
reminded me of my mother

1229
02:42:14,688 --> 02:42:17,475
Mother would say, do good
and forget about it

1230
02:42:17,898 --> 02:42:22,153
Do your duty, never expect rewards.
True love lies in sacrifice

1231
02:42:23,348 --> 02:42:28,923
Uncle Jaidev said it's trash.
Grab, grab, grab

1232
02:42:32,148 --> 02:42:35,265
l don't know why l get this
losing feeling

1233
02:42:36,798 --> 02:42:40,734
That Manav of yours,
he's trying to defeat me

1234
02:42:42,828 --> 02:42:46,013
And l'm not used to defeat!
Not at all

1235
02:42:46,738 --> 02:42:49,684
l want to win.
Come what may

1236
02:42:50,908 --> 02:42:56,801
lf you feel the slightest gratitude
towards me, you will help me win

1237
02:42:57,488 --> 02:42:59,444
l...? How?

1238
02:43:00,788 --> 02:43:03,234
Look... at my love.

1239
02:43:04,958 --> 02:43:10,851
l possess only arrogance,
envy, jealousy, grit

1240
02:43:12,008 --> 02:43:16,763
And Manav? God lives in him.
God, really

1241
02:43:17,778 --> 02:43:23,671
His love, his true love
will hit me hard, always

1242
02:43:27,398 --> 02:43:33,962
He was right. Marriage is no contract
nor festivity. lt's a union of souls

1243
02:43:34,938 --> 02:43:38,863
Of two people who will live
to consummate their loves

1244
02:43:40,228 --> 02:43:44,324
He was right. Winning world contests,
and fashionable clothes...

1245
02:43:44,328 --> 02:43:46,694
cannot change
the quintessential lndian girl

1246
02:43:48,308 --> 02:43:51,516
For her, the first love
is always the first love

1247
02:43:54,338 --> 02:43:58,206
Look, l'm a director.
l know it

1248
02:43:59,078 --> 02:44:03,014
l hear the voice inside.
Manav pervades you...

1249
02:44:02,988 --> 02:44:08,346
your every pore,
your every drop of blood. Look

1250
02:44:11,248 --> 02:44:15,025
Silly girl! You fought with
your love and you came to me

1251
02:44:15,578 --> 02:44:18,854
You changed yourself,
couldn't change your heart

1252
02:44:20,708 --> 02:44:29,070
Your heart is there... with Manav.
Manav is the music in your songs

1253
02:44:29,848 --> 02:44:31,315
Not l

1254
02:44:31,928 --> 02:44:37,013
Today... you have to give me victory.

1255
02:44:38,828 --> 02:44:40,784
Guess how? Open this door

1256
02:44:42,348 --> 02:44:46,614
And run to Manav in
front of everyone

1257
02:44:50,528 --> 02:44:52,985
Please. For my sake

1258
02:44:54,218 --> 02:44:56,118
For the happiness
of all three of us

1259
02:44:58,478 --> 02:45:00,605
Go. Go, Manasi!

1260
02:45:02,808 --> 02:45:08,383
We, l mean you, me and Manav
will always remain friends

1261
02:45:19,808 --> 02:45:21,764
Come on. Don't think

1262
02:45:23,648 --> 02:45:25,616
Come on. He's called you.
- No Banerjee

1263
02:45:25,898 --> 02:45:29,334
Manasi is going to Manav.
Go Manasi, go

1264
02:45:41,448 --> 02:45:42,756
Go

1265
02:45:43,848 --> 02:45:45,816
Manav is waiting for you

1266
02:45:53,238 --> 02:45:55,354
Manasi has gone to Manav

1267
02:45:56,918 --> 02:45:58,556
Yes

1268
02:46:02,368 --> 02:46:04,984
So now...
- Let's embrace

1269
02:47:26,478 --> 02:47:29,584
We separated you.
- And we're bringing you together

1270
02:47:30,638 --> 02:47:32,594
You have our blessings

1271
02:47:33,358 --> 02:47:35,804
Embrace her

1272
02:47:37,528 --> 02:47:40,315
How can they?
We're looking on

1273
02:47:40,578 --> 02:47:42,534
Let's get out of here

1274
02:47:59,908 --> 02:48:03,184
ls this possible?
- lt's happening
