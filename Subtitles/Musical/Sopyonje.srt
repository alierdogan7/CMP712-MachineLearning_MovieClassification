1
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:26,774
Thanks.

2
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:52,978
Can I have a room?

3
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,272
Yes, but it won't be that comfortable.

4
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,177
It doesn't matter,
as long as I can sleep.

5
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,950
Do you want a meal?

6
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:04,748
Just a drink.

7
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,353
I heard this hill
is called Pansori Hill,

8
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:14,025
and this inn is called Pansori Inn.

9
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:19,395
Is it because of your Pansori?

10
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:26,243
Then someone sang
Pansori before you did?

11
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:27,303
Yes.

12
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:32,182
They were named after him.

13
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:37,584
Then did you learn Pansori from him?

14
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,885
No, but I learned it

15
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,820
from his daughter.

16
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,561
Why don't you sing some of it?

17
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:51,336
I'll play the drum.

18
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:05,617
I shall go.

19
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,785
I shall go.

20
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:22,263
I shall go after my love.

21
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:31,274
Even where the winds and clouds rest.

22
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:50,223
Along with the wild geese in flocks.

23
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:59,338
Over the Dongseolryung Hill,

24
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:07,437
I shall follow my love.

25
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:16,917
Although the galaxy is blocked...

26
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:26,288
The Altair and the Vega meet once a year.

27
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:35,205
Why has my love not come yet?

28
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:53,119
I shall die now and become a swallow.

29
00:04:53,393 --> 00:05:02,324
Make a nest under the roof.

30
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:11,100
Meet my love at night.

31
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:20,581
And reminisce my love.

32
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,854
Who caused this eternal separation?

33
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:48,409
What shall I do without my love?

34
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:57,587
I cry in secret.

35
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,685
That's nice.

36
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:01,886
Who's that?

37
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:06,230
A Pansori singer invited by Yoon.

38
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,868
Since Yoon's fortunes were on the wane,

39
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:15,400
he just invited a vagabond Pansori singer.

40
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,205
I'm going to Gangjin tomorrow.

41
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:28,547
I heard Chosun will perform during
the ceremony at the rice mill./Yes.

42
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,783
You're going to stay here longer, huh?

43
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,116
Yes, I'm going to.

44
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,948
I have no other place to go.

45
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:47,493
After a secret royal inspector appeared,
they gathered.

46
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:53,597
With a wooden club, the royal seal
which is like the moon.

47
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:57,872
From all directions, they're gathering.

48
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:02,308
-The secret royal inspector has come!
-He has come!

49
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,979
-He has come!
-He has come!

50
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:16,455
The secret royal inspector has come!

51
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:21,763
The sky has fallen,
and the earth has collapsed.

52
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:26,231
Hundreds of sightseers are
scattered like waves.

53
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:33,043
What a frightening sight!
What a surprise!

54
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:37,476
Everyone trembles with fear.

55
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:41,149
The local governors are running away,
and the servants are scattering.

56
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:47,322
Food is stepped on, and dishes are broken.

57
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,886
Janggus are broken, drums are kicked.
Noegos are played.

58
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:57,202
Jegeums and flutes are stepped on,
and kisaengs lose their hairpins.

59
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:02,201
trumpeters lose their instruments.

60
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,712
Artillery makes a 'bang'
sound with its mouth.

61
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:11,808
Their foreheads and noses are broken.
They are bleeding and knocked down.

62
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:16,621
"Ouch, ouch," some are crying.

63
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:19,290
Some are running away.

64
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:23,154
Our town is in trouble.

65
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:29,329
More messengers...

66
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:20,242
There's a rumor about us in the village.

67
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,313
What's wrong
with a widower and widow's love?

68
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:28,613
I'm scared that I'll encounter a mishap.

69
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:30,251
Mishap?

70
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,390
My family doesn't like it.

71
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:34,985
How come?

72
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,324
They say it dishonors the family.

73
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:42,699
Because I'm a man of lowly status?

74
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,235
Do you think so, too?

75
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:50,273
If I did, would I be like this?

76
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:53,744
Let's leave this place.

77
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,440
Though I'm a poor Pansori singer,

78
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,910
I won't let you starve.

79
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,790
Will Song-hwa like me?

80
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,290
I mean your daughter.

81
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,226
It doesn't matter.
She's not my real daughter.

82
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:16,661
She's an orphan. I'm with her
to make her a Pansori singer.

83
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,414
Push, push...

84
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,150
Push harder.

85
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,405
Harder.

86
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:37,606
Isn't his name Yu-bong?

87
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:38,704
That's right.

88
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,406
He sang Pansori here

89
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:45,245
and passed away.

90
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,917
I learned
Pansori from Song-hwa, his daughter.

91
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,681
What happened to Song-hwa?

92
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:59,062
After mourning for three years,
she went somewhere.

93
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,122
Do you know where?

94
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:08,566
No, but I wonder
what a blind woman can do by herself.

95
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,368
You mean...

96
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,272
You mean, she's blind?

97
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,439
Yes.

98
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,808
How did she lose her sight?

99
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:24,754
Well...

100
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:29,456
Rumor says he made her blind
to make her a good singer,

101
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:34,222
or to prevent her from running away.

102
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:01,818
Someone said he couldn't have

103
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,325
made her blind

104
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:09,394
to keep her by his side.

105
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:14,372
He made her
blind to put anguish in her heart

106
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:18,370
so that she'd be a good Pansori singer.

107
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:20,142
But...

108
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,315
that's not trustworthy either.

109
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:32,354
Ari-arirang, Suri-surirang.

110
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:40,196
Arariga natne.

111
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:45,665
Try it, Dong-ho.

112
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,438
It's not that.

113
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:04,251
It's not like that.

114
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,788
Go away!

115
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,058
Song-hwa, try it.

116
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,788
Your feet here,
and place your hand on it.

117
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,351
Sit up straight, hold the stick properly.

118
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,497
-Now, we're going to try Jungmori again.
-OK.

119
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,531
Louder.

120
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:03,374
I miss my love,

121
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:06,907
I miss my love...

122
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:10,677
Is there something on the floor?
why are you looking at the floor?

123
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,257
Again.

124
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:19,526
I miss my love...

125
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:29,269
I miss my love, I miss my love...
I miss my love in Hanyang.

126
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:38,014
After separating with him,

127
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:46,357
I've never received a letter from him.

128
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:50,786
Is it because

129
00:18:52,097 --> 00:19:01,768
he's busy studying?

130
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,108
"Lee" stands for plum.

131
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,970
It's a "son" under a "tree" in characters.

132
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:15,485
Even if the son is over 60,
he'll be below his parents.

133
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:20,023
Excellent!

134
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:24,555
He's really good.
What a calligrapher.

135
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,158
I need to ask him for one, too.

136
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:34,038
"Min" stands for the people.

137
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:38,936
For the people's courteous treatment,
I added a phoenix.

138
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:42,740
Sure. Absolutely.

139
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:44,514
Be quiet.

140
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,015
Stop making noise.

141
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,244
"Ju" stands for pillar.

142
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:53,617
We all need a good pillar.

143
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:58,194
So I drew
a pine tree pillar and a crane.

144
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,324
Lee Min-ju.

145
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,392
Nice name.

146
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,534
Can I have one, too?

147
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:12,368
I've met my buddy.

148
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:14,879
and I'm going to have a drink with him.

149
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:24,348
How do you do?

150
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:29,017
Song-hwa's become a woman.

151
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:30,656
When are you going to be my daughter?

152
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:32,694
Don't you dare want my daughter.

153
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,192
Aren't you going to greet your big father?

154
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,200
-Give us a drink and some tofu please.
-OK.

155
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,242
What brings you here, anyway?

156
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:49,072
I heard
a good Pansori singer will perform.

157
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:52,244
So I brought them to hear him.

158
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,181
-I was there yesterday.
-Oh.

159
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:58,455
But he was sick,
so another man performed instead.

160
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,455
Really?

161
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:08,062
Anyway, why don't you let me take them?

162
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,092
What do you mean?

163
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:15,905
Japanese songs were popular. But after
the liberation, western songs got popular.

164
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:19,401
Learning old songs is meaningless.

165
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:24,610
If they learn how to draw from me,
they won't starve.

166
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,476
Shut up, man.

167
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:30,112
Japanese
and western songs can't beat Pansori.

168
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:34,319
You'll see.
Pansori will conquer all.

169
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:38,620
The moon, the bright moon.
No matter how busy you are,

170
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:48,356
please hang high in the sky.
So tomorrow won't come,

171
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:57,440
and 100 years will be like tonight.

172
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:12,119
Please don't let us get old.
Love, my love.

173
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:16,393
She refused my order

174
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,858
to serve me.

175
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:23,492
One.

176
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:31,072
Since you hit me once,

177
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:36,703
I'll answer with "one."

178
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:46,522
I've decided on one mindset.

179
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:52,060
It won't change in one second.

180
00:23:55,233 --> 00:24:00,398
It's hopeless to think I'll change.

181
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,449
Yu-bong!

182
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:23,858
Are you running away?

183
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,098
-Welcome.
-Do you have a room?

184
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:36,240
Here comes the hero.

185
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:37,103
Take him to a room.

186
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:49,244
Why do you have a big nose?

187
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:51,611
I wonder if your thing is big as well.

188
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:56,485
If it gets mad, you'll die.

189
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:59,161
We'll have to see who's going to die.

190
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,228
She's totally crazy about him.

191
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:05,597
Girls are crazy about the hero.

192
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:10,368
Who's crazy?
I prefer this oyster.

193
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:16,777
I wonder if he's deaf?

194
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:18,347
Yu-bong,

195
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:22,414
You're going to cut all ties with Seoul?

196
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:26,321
The master
said this before he passed away.

197
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:29,384
He told us to cancel your expulsion when

198
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:33,527
5 years have passed since Chu-wol died.

199
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:35,866
He's too much.

200
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:40,203
He blocked his student's future.

201
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,435
Hey, let's stop talking about that.

202
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,875
Who is Chu-wol?

203
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,080
She was our master's concubine.

204
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:56,286
Something happened between him and her?

205
00:25:58,456 --> 00:25:59,855
Did she die, too?

206
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,288
She killed herself more than 5 years ago.

207
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,190
Ohmo

208
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:07,320
She took advantage of you.
Not the other way around...

209
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,264
I said, stop talking about that.

210
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:11,502
Your talent is a terrible thing to waste.

211
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:16,574
You couldn't finish learning
and have been wandering.

212
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:21,476
I can take care of myself
without a teacher. So shut up.

213
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:26,607
Come on, you still have a temper.
I was thinking of you.

214
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:30,844
Who asked you to worry about me?
Mind your own business.

215
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:33,721
You think your Pansori
skill deserves a stage?

216
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,888
What?

217
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:38,627
You think you're the best?

218
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:40,395
-What's going on?
-You, jerk!

219
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,357
Guys, easy. Yu-bong's drunk.

220
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:47,232
As a dog...

221
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:50,939
Friends? Yeah, right.

222
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:55,402
I know you're enjoying teasing me.

223
00:26:57,015 --> 00:27:01,247
Drunk as a dog?
Right, you can say that again.

224
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,818
Though I've been wandering like a dog,

225
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:09,158
I'm not scared of you guys at all.

226
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:11,195
You'll see.

227
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:13,321
-That's not scary at all.
-What?

228
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,658
What's wrong with you guys?

229
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:20,268
Guys, it's late. Go back to the inn.

230
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:23,272
I'll continue drinking with Yu-bong.

231
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,773
We were drinking pleasantly. What's this?

232
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:26,634
Let's go.

233
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:30,478
Have a seat.

234
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:39,213
You and your pride.

235
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:45,122
Without it, I would have gone crazy.

236
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,887
Here, cheers.

237
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:48,995
I think he'd better stop drinking.

238
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,928
Are you thinking of me, too?

239
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,762
I'll take care of myself. Shut up.

240
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:58,200
After he opened his mouth,
he's become hot.

241
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,102
-Shut up and give me a drink!
-OK.

242
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:04,311
Yu-bong, let's go back to the city.

243
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,077
If I go, you guys

244
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,145
will be dead.

245
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,056
Let's see if that's true.

246
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,322
You arrogant man.

247
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,322
You think too much of yourself.

248
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:26,935
You shouldn't talk thoughtlessly.

249
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:30,570
You were the best pupil then,
but it's me now.

250
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:35,437
Is that so?
Sorry I didn't recognize you.

251
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:40,183
-Hey, give this virtuoso a drink.
-OK

252
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,184
-Come on.
-Come on.

253
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:54,591
Hey

254
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:00,262
Stop being cocky
and perform Pansori well.

255
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:01,232
What?

256
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,368
Are you...

257
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:08,369
You want to leave?

258
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,278
Go ahead.

259
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,281
Hey, Do-sang.

260
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:25,121
Let's go to my inn and drink some more.

261
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,094
Good-bye.

262
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:07,188
Love, love, love, my love.

263
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:09,565
You missed one beat.

264
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:19,405
Come here and play with me.
Love, love, love, my love.

265
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:26,246
It's love, my love

266
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,779
Again. Add some Chuimsae, too.

267
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:41,821
Love, love, love, my love.
It's love, my love.

268
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:49,801
It's my love. My love.

269
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:54,410
What are you going to eat?
Sour wild apricots.

270
00:31:54,746 --> 00:32:03,245
You'll have small Lee Doryung...

271
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:04,413
Sis.

272
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:07,485
What's small Lee Doryung?

273
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:14,054
It means having Lee Doryung's baby.

274
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:21,602
What are you going to eat?

275
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:30,541
Sour wild apricots.
You'll have small Lee Doryung...

276
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:39,515
No, I don't want that either.
Then, what are you going to eat?

277
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:48,765
Are you going to eat sweet melons?

278
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:57,371
I don't want that either. My love.

279
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:06,474
You want grapes or cherries?
You want some candy?

280
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:10,014
My love.

281
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:19,393
Go that way. Let me see your back.
Come here. Let me see your front.

282
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:24,065
Walk on. Let me see you walk.

283
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:32,207
Smile.
Let me see your tonsils. My love.

284
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,807
Great.

285
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:39,511
You sing so well.

286
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:43,650
Your voice
is wonderful and you're pretty.

287
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:46,320
Should I take your virginity?

288
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:52,489
Will I sell my field?

289
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:57,166
Will I sell a part of the mountain?

290
00:33:57,301 --> 00:34:01,328
-Hey, fill up my glass.
-Right. Pour him a drink.

291
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:06,401
She's too young

292
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:09,145
to know how to do that.

293
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,647
Shut up. Just do as I say.

294
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,610
Baby, go ahead.

295
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:16,249
Do it.

296
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,023
-You're light-headed.
-It's OK.

297
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:35,097
For punishment, you take a glass.

298
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:37,400
I can't drink.

299
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:41,411
If you don't drink it,
you can't go home tonight.

300
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:47,277
It's from your elder. Take it.

301
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,650
Hey, at least pretend to drink.

302
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:54,187
Come on!

303
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,122
Good, good.

304
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:04,029
Hey!

305
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,562
That's too much for a little one.

306
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:08,864
What?

307
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:13,037
If you had taught her properly,
this wouldn't have happened.

308
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:16,571
I teach Pansori,
not how to pour drinks.

309
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:20,814
How can a lowly man talk back to me?

310
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,116
Times have changed!

311
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,153
How could you talk back to me?

312
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:31,218
Yu-bong, ask them to forgive you.

313
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:32,362
I didn't do anything wrong!

314
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:35,222
Although times have changed,

315
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:40,231
a lowly man is still a lowly man!

316
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:45,042
Don't ever think of working here again!

317
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:49,408
You, boor!
Hey, why did you get a man like him?

318
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:51,576
What low-level dirt!

319
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:25,172
Bad girl!

320
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,310
You actually poured them drinks?

321
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,146
How could she not?

322
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,014
How dare you talk back to me?

323
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:35,188
You have no discretion!

324
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,499
What kind of father is he?

325
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,337
What do you mean?

326
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:49,234
How could a father hit you like that?

327
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:54,270
Because I did something wrong.
He must've been really angry.

328
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:55,812
What did you do wrong?

329
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,744
How long are you going to live like this?

330
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:09,559
With Pansori, your future is dark.
Till when are you going to follow him?

331
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,689
I still like Pansori.

332
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:19,234
When I sing it, I'm happy.

333
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:24,071
He spends all you make on drinks.

334
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:30,412
He must be hurting deeply inside.
I feel sorry for Father, too.

335
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,478
Father? He's nothing.

336
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,120
Dong-ho, you shouldn't say that.

337
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:42,181
He suffered while raising us.

338
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:26,535
Dear, are you really going to leave?

339
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:35,309
What about me?

340
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:44,354
When are you coming back?
Tell me when.

341
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:54,321
Will you be back...

342
00:38:54,465 --> 00:39:01,928
when the high peaks flatten?

343
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:12,173
Will you return in March,

344
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:20,382
when flowers bloom?

345
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:24,325
Will you be back

346
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:31,232
when a small stone becomes an ore?

347
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:35,566
Is he playing a drum or what?

348
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:42,437
Unjongryong Pungjongho.

349
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:48,076
Clouds go where dragons go.

350
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:55,688
Winds go where tigers go.

351
00:39:57,194 --> 00:40:05,727
Where you have gone,

352
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:14,237
I will follow.

353
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:22,842
He's also taken aback...

354
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:27,114
Move aside. Move aside.

355
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:31,384
Are you playing the drum?

356
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:39,768
Because I said so,

357
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:43,629
you may think this is a panacea.

358
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:45,635
But it's absolutely not.

359
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:50,043
It works well on only one disease.

360
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:52,907
So what is that disease?

361
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:56,318
Come on in.

362
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:09,727
Eat these.

363
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:22,210
Listen...

364
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:25,675
A drum has to

365
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,286
harmonize with the voice.

366
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:33,790
If you bang it,
that's not playing a drum,

367
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:36,292
but beating leather.

368
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:41,927
For a car to run,

369
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:44,697
the road has to be smooth.

370
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,101
Likewise,

371
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:52,039
the drum and Chuimsae have
to make a smooth way for Pansori.

372
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:58,173
Like we have four seasons,

373
00:41:58,716 --> 00:41:59,910
there are

374
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:05,081
four ways to play a drum.

375
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,987
How many times have I told you?

376
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,957
If you play Jungmori...

377
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:14,923
Here's number one

378
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:17,726
two

379
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,200
three

380
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:21,564
four

381
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,707
Got it?

382
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,042
I'm sleeping. Be quiet

383
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:27,105
And...

384
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:30,246
when you say the Chuimsae...

385
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:37,143
When the sound starts fading,

386
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:42,385
you have to encourage it
by saying "Ulsigu."

387
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:46,526
And when the sound becomes sad,

388
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,697
you have to dampen the drum beat,
and add a sad Chuimsae.

389
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:56,362
When the sound becomes strong,
you have to play the drum strongly,

390
00:42:57,174 --> 00:42:58,903
and say the Chuimsae strongly, too!

391
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:09,450
If there are 1,000 beats in Chunhyangga,

392
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:16,356
you have to practice a million times

393
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,294
to make the drum sound

394
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:23,366
soak into your body.

395
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:24,896
Got it?

396
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:30,199
We want to get some sleep!
I'm sick of your drunken frenzies!

397
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:32,306
Me too.

398
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:36,906
I'm also sick and tired of following you
around to sell Pansori.

399
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:41,848
You and your damn Pansori skills.

400
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:44,346
-What?
-lf you're tired of it, quit!

401
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:49,324
OK, I'm going to quit!
I'm not going to have your dirty meals!

402
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:54,262
That's good.
We wanted violin players anyway.

403
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:55,489
Pack your things!

404
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:59,199
Pay back what you owe me!

405
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:19,083
How long can we live?

406
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:30,366
Let's live smoothly.

407
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:41,136
What kind of a hill is Mungyungseje?

408
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:50,750
I cry along the way.

409
00:44:51,455 --> 00:45:02,389
A vagabond life following Pansori.

410
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:12,866
Let's relieve our anguish.

411
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:22,979
There are many small stars in the sky.

412
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:32,954
There are many worries in our hearts.

413
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:42,734
Ariarirang. Surisurirang. Arariga natne.

414
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:52,344
Arirang. Arariga nate.

415
00:45:52,850 --> 00:46:02,054
My dear love is gone.

416
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:11,324
Gone forever, following the wild geese.

417
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:20,407
Let's ask that wild goose.

418
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:30,019
Where are we supposed to go?

419
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:53,034
Golden baby or jade baby. Oh, my baby.

420
00:46:53,343 --> 00:47:00,408
Learn Pansori
diligently and be a virtuoso.

421
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:07,651
I'll add
excitement to brother's drum beat,

422
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:14,427
and follow the long road to Pansori.

423
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:34,512
Let's play.

424
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:41,222
Let's play until the moon rises and falls.

425
00:47:54,905 --> 00:48:01,140
Cold or hot? Come into my arms.

426
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:07,475
Lay your head on my arm.

427
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:26,900
The sun sets at the western hill.
It didn't want to set.

428
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:33,642
My dear who left me.
My love didn't want to leave me.
