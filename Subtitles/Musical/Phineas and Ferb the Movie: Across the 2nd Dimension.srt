263
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,827
          Do you even need that?

264
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:38,196
      Well, of course I...

265
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:41,232
    Wait a minute.
    No, I do not need that.

266
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,435
   You are absolutely right.

267
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:45,704
          So Ferb has rigged up
          this remote control

268
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,439
 so that if we get
 separated from the portal,
 we can open another one.

269
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:48,606
                Nice touch, kid.

270
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,809
 I guess this is
 the last piece.

271
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,510
        Okay, Ferb,
        boost me up.

272
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:56,581
 Ooh, I cannot wait!

273
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,304
          (CHATTERING)

274
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,289
         PHINEAS:
         There you are, Perry.
      Perry?

275
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,691
      Yeah. He's our
      pet platypus.

276
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:07,492
       Is every platypus
       named Perry?

277
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:10,361
    In a perfect world, yes.

278
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:11,763
    Well, he's a cute
    little fellow.

279
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:13,465
         Hi, there.
    Coochee, coochee...
        Ow! Ow! Ow!

280
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:15,734
             Perry, no!
             We do not bite
             the elderly.

281
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,836
      Again, ow!
      It's okay.

282
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,604
 Platypuses don't
 typically like me.

283
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,371
    Well, Perry, you're just
    in time to see us open
    a window

284
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:24,342
    into another dimension.

285
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,010
      Perry, no!
      What are you doing?

286
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,746
                   No, no!

287
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:30,381
  Perry, this is not
  tug of war!

288
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,283
      This is not
      tug of war!

289
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:34,486
 Silly boy,
 what's gotten into him?

290
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:35,687
         All right,
         let's get this show
         on the road, huh?

291
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:38,456
 <i> Remember,</i>
 <i> if your cover is blown,</i>

292
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,825
    <i> you'll never see</i>
    <i> the boys again.</i>

293
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:42,393
          Hey, does anyone hear
          someone talking?

294
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:44,596
 <i> Never see them again.</i>

295
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:48,700
 Okay, here we go.
 Right in...

296
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,904
    Perry! No!
    Not on the sofa!

297
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:56,541
 I'm sorry, Dr. D.
 We should take him out.

298
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:58,560
 No, no. Wait.
 It'll be all right.

299
00:12:58,561 --> 00:13:00,578
 I was planning on
 replacing this
 old couch anyway.

300
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,480
    Now come on.
    Let's light
    this pop stand,

301
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:02,680
 or however it goes.

302
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,554
            Gosh, this is...
            It's kind of
            weird, actually.

303
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:11,923
         I'm usually thwarted
         by this point.

304
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,825
            Well, I guess
            he's not coming.

305
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:16,995
        And now, behold!

306
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:21,699
 The mind-blowing
 first images from beyond
 our dimensional reality!

307
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:30,942
                   Hmm.

308
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:33,878
              It's a...
              It's a couch.

309
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,880
  That's a bit
  anticlimactic.

310
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:39,784
 I guess it's a nice couch,
 though...

311
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:42,921
  Hey! I got an idea!
  Let's swap my couch
  for that one!

312
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,174
                  Um...

313
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:48,025
 I got it. I got...
 Or maybe I...

314
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:50,028
            Come on, you want to
            give me a hand here?

315
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,396
  Whoa! Awesome,
  check it out.

316

00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:00,705
           PHINEAS: Hey, Dr. D!
           Look at this.

320
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,073
  Hold that thought.

321
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,440
 You're famous here.

 "Heinz Doofenshmirtz,

324
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,734
     A whole tri-state area
     where I am already in
     charge!

325
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:32,570
        Yeah! Hold on,
        I gotta go check
        something out.

326
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:35,573
          Uh, yoo-hoo!
         Hello, again.

327
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:38,443
   Is this some kind of test?
   Is that really you, sir?

00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:40,044

       dimension!

330
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,017
     I prefer the term
     "indentured
     executive assistant."

331
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,152
    Well, I want to meet
    this other dimension me.

332
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:50,555
     Where can I find him?

333
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,123
     Oh. You're from
     another dimension?

334
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,058
     Well, he'll probably
     wanna see you then.

335
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,793
    He's into that
    freaky sort of stuff.

336
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:58,796
    Have a seat
    and I'll let him know
    you're on your way up.

337
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:01,165
          Okay. So I just
          gotta sit here and...

00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,040
  Well, obviously you
  did not have to deal

400
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,175
 with my nemesis,
 Perry the Platypus.

401
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:59,744
          Oh, didn't I? Observe.

402
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:02,313
     What is it?

403
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:08,719
       DOOFENSHMIRTZ 2D:
       This is Perry the
       Platyborg!

404
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:13,057
        He was once my nemesis,
        but now, he's general
        of my army!

405
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:15,059
  Wow! You are good!

406
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:16,661
              DOOFENSHMIRTZ 2D:
              Dismissed.

407
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,697
           That was awesome!

408
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,516
               Now who's
               interrupting me?

409
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,334
            Remind me to berate
               my indentured
            executive assistant.

410
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:24,669
 No, man, it's cool.
 They're with me.

411
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:27,772
   Hey, Dr. D.
   We thought we'd lost you.

412
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,006
    Hi, fellas!

413
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:31,676
        You dare to bring
        a secret agent in here?

414
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:32,977
     This boy's
     a secret agent?

415
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:35,179
                 No, not him!
     The quiet one?

416
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:36,714
            DOOFENSHMIRTZ 2D:
            No! Not... No. Him!

417
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:39,083
        This plant?

418
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:42,687
            The platypus!
            That's Secret Agent
            Perry the Platypus!

419
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:44,956
     Oh, hey.
     He's just a platypus.
     He doesn't do much.

420
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,992
                  This is rich.
                   I see what's
                  going on here.

421
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:51,162
            You really think
            that he's your pet,
            don't you?

422
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:52,897
          Wrong! He's using you!

423
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:54,398
         You're just his cover.
         He's a secret agent!

424
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,834
        Here, here,
        let me prove it.

425
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:59,403
        General Platyborg,
        come down here at once.

426
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:02,406
              He'll be here
              in just a second.
              Ow! Ow! Ow!

427
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:04,408
          All right, Platyborg,
          you see that platypus?

428
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,643
            You know what to do.

429
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,745
             Perry!

430
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,183
 What was that for?
 Perry, are you okay?

431
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:14,418
       Told you.

432
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,420
 How are his vitals?

433
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:19,924
                Wait, let me
                try something.
                Platyborg!

434
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:21,425
             Do the same thing
            to those two boys.
       What?

435
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:24,428
          What?

436
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:28,799

           <i> ♪ Perry ♪</i>

437
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,435

438
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:33,371
               Yes! I knew it!

439
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:34,972
    Wait a minute.
    I'm confused.

440
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:35,740
 Why does their platypus
 fight so good?

441
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:39,677
      Perry the Platypus!

442
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,446
                 Really?

           Get them!

446
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:51,355
          You're a secret agent?

             Whoa! Whoa!

448

   Hey, be careful with that.

449
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:00,097
               So this is where
               you disappear to
               every day?

450
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:01,999
            You come here
            and fight this guy?

451
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:05,169
              No, he fights me.
              He doesn't really
              know this guy.

452
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:06,971
    You fight a pharmacist?
    Why would you even do
    that?

453
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:09,440
     Actually,
     I'm an evil scientist.

454
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:12,276
        A lot of people
        are confused by
        the lab coat.

455
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:13,911
                   You're evil?
                   He's evil?

        (GLASS CRACKING)

457
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:22,153
          So, not only have you
          been leading a double
          life this whole time,

458
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:25,022
              but you sat there
              and let us help
              an evil scientist

459
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:26,490
        open an evil portal
        into an evil dimension!

460
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:28,459
            And you did nothing
            to stop us?

461
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:30,928
        Well, he did pee
        on the couch.

462
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,763
        Wait a second,
        I just realized.

463
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:35,900
     That was a conscious
     choice.
     You peed on my couch!

464
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,435
            No, no.
            That wasn't enough.

465
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:39,303
    That's when you should
    have
    put on your little hat.

466
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:42,306
         Not now, after we've
         gone through it into
         this mess!

467
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:45,176
      For badness sake,
      you can hash all
      this out in prison.

468
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:46,944
            Guards!

00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:01,025
 I'm sorry.
 I'm just having trouble
 processing this right now.

 "So you've discovered
 your pet is a secret
 agent."

473
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:04,328
       I don't want
       your pamphlet!

474
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:07,765
         Uh-oh.

475
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:14,805
                    He's coming
                    back around!

00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:27,852
           You have got
           to be kidding me.

478
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:32,123
          For crying out loud.

479
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,791
 What, they didn't teach
 you
 how to get out of this
 in spy school?

480
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:44,235
                Oh, snap.

481
00:21:44,237 --> 00:21:45,303
           Look! There's a logo
           on this parachute!

482
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:47,438
          He's got his own logo?

483
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,261
      All this time we're like,
      "He's a platypus.
      He doesn't do much."

484
00:22:10,263 --> 00:22:13,564
       Well, apparently you do!
       You do... You're...

485

          Never mind. I'm good.

495
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,648
            Looks like
            they're gone.

496
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:40,451
         You're a secret agent?

497
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:42,186
             And you've been
              living with us
             this whole time?

498

        Was that evil guy right?

499
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:45,523
          Were we just
          a cover story to you?

500
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:47,925
          I mean, were you ever
              really our pet
          or part of our family?

501
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,995
   Well, apparently not,
   'cause you didn't trust us
   enough to tell us.

502
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:53,931
     Anyone else
     around here leading
     a bizarre double life?

   Put your hand down, Ferb.

     You're a secret agent!
     He's a secret agent!

505
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:05,643
      You're right, Ferb.
    We've got to concentrate
      on the task at hand.

506
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:08,379
   We've got to get back
   to our dimension,

507
00:24:08,381 --> 00:24:10,114
   and I don't even know
   where to start!

508
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,116
     That's right!
     The remote!

509
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,384
   I knew that would
   come in handy.

510
00:24:13,386 --> 00:24:14,385
         All right,
         let's go home.

511
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:18,522
               Wait, that's not
               our dimension.

512
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:20,224
              Nope. Uh-uh.

513
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,164
    Now this thing's broken.
    We're gonna need some
    help.

514
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,500
     I know!
     Let's go find us!

515
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:35,673
  Wait, I just realized,

516
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:39,376
 you could have been
 cleaning your own
 litter box this whole
 time!

517
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:43,714
 We are not done
 with this conversation.

518
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:47,017
          So tell me,
          other dimension me,
          what do you see here?

519
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:48,419
 An ordinary platypus.

520
00:24:48,421 --> 00:24:50,120
             And now
             what do you see?

521
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:51,722
  Perry the Platypus!

522
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:53,390
            You know,
            I'm starting to see

523
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:55,759
            why you haven't
            become ruler
            in your dimension.

524
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:58,429
 All right,
 Mr. Eviler-Than-Thou,

525
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,098
 just how did you
 manage to take over
 the tri-state area anyway?

526
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,635
             Simple, I used
            an army of big,
             scary robots.

527
00:25:04,637 --> 00:25:07,071
      NORMBOTS: <i> We should</i>
      <i> do lunch sometime.</i>

528
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:09,507
   Wow, that is scary.

529
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:11,408
  I tried that
  robot thing once, too.

530
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,177
    I hid the self-destruct
    button
    on the bottoms of their
    feet

531
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,145
 <i> so no one</i>
 <i> could reach them.</i>

532
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:19,984
                  And march!

533
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:21,185
 I think I've said enough.
 I still don't get it.

534
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:24,522
 If we're the same person,
 why are you so much better
 at being evil than me?

535
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:28,559
     True evil is born
     through pain and loss.

536
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:31,762
         You see,
         when I was a small boy
         back in Gimelschtump,

537
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:34,598
              I had a toy train.

538
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,166
       <i> Then, one day I lost it.</i>

539
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:37,434
        Choo-Choo?

540
00:25:41,274 --> 00:25:43,741
  That's... That's it?
            What do you mean?

541
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:45,643
  That's your emotionally
  scarring back-story?

542
00:25:45,645 --> 00:25:47,611
       That's your
       great tragedy?

543
00:25:47,613 --> 00:25:50,347
       Dude! I was
       raised by ocelots.
       I mean, literally.

544
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:52,716
   Disowned by my parents
   and raised by
   Central American wildcats,

545
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:55,085
     and you're telling me
     you lost a toy train?
     That's all?

546
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:57,288
 That's all you got,
       really?

547
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,756
        I had to work
        as a lawn gnome!

548
00:25:58,758 --> 00:26:00,357
      <i> I was forced to wear</i>
      <i> hand-me-up girl's</i>
      <i> clothing!</i>

549
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:03,694
    <i> Neither of my parents</i>
    <i> showed up for my birth!</i>

550
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:06,196
             Well, how did you
             feel when you lost
             that toy train?

551
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:07,831
     I never lost
     that toy train...

552
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:10,234
        Well, maybe if you had,
        you'd have done better.

553
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:13,504
       Since you have neglected
       to take over your
       tri-state area,

554
00:26:13,506 --> 00:26:16,707
   I think I'll go over there
   and give it a shot myself!

555
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:19,209
  Great!
  We can be a team!

556
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:21,679
            Yeah, right. A team.

557
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:23,080
 Wait, was that sarcasm?

558
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,715
                      No!

559
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:26,349
 Yeah! Right there!
 I'm pretty sure
 that's my voice

560
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:28,118
 when I'm being sarcastic.

561
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:28,686
          Okay, Buford,
          where are
          Phineas and Ferb?

562
00:26:28,688 --> 00:26:30,821
              How should I know?

563
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:32,690
        They never showed up
        for me to return serve!

564
00:26:32,692 --> 00:26:35,392
     That's considered a
     forfeit
     in catapult badminton.

565
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:37,127
        So I went to get
       some Victory Gum.

566
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:38,562
        CHORUS:
        <i> ♪ Victory Gum! ♪</i>

567
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:41,131
             A tradition as old
            as the game itself.

568
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:42,399
 Don't play with me,
 young man.

569
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:44,435
 Where is the giant
 platypult they built?

570
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:46,370
        I don't know.
        Seems to have vanished.

571
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:48,472
              Really? Did you
              hear that, Stacy?

572
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:50,541
        The mysterious force
        took the platypult away

573
00:26:50,543 --> 00:26:52,743
        before I, the grown-up,
        could see it.

574
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:56,246
 Yeah, yeah. I'm sure
 there's a perfectly
 logical
 explanation for all of

575
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:59,316
        And they laughed at me
        for installing
        a platypult tow rig!

576
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:00,751
   Who's laughing now, Wayne?

577
00:27:00,753 --> 00:27:04,755
        The logical explanation
        is the mysterious force.

578
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:06,523
          The real question is,

579
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:08,792
       why does it care so much
      about my little brothers?

580
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:11,495
         Why doesn't it want
         them to get busted?

581
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:14,197
            Well, why don't you
            ask it, Kierkegaard?

582
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,567
           What? Existentialist
           trading cards.

583
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:18,619
        They came with the gum.

584
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,670
        Wait, he's right!
        I should just ask it!

585
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:22,773
             I'll bet I can
             reason with it.
   Reason with it?

586
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:26,276
 Candace, it's a force
 that you made up.

587
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:28,345
          No, I know what I'm
          talking about, Stacy!

588
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:29,780
 Come on!
     STACY: Where are you
            going?

589
00:27:29,782 --> 00:27:33,751
  To my back yard!
  The heart of the
 mysterious force!

590
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:36,153
 Would you like to
  trade two Sartre
  for a Nietzsche?

591
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,521
                 All right.

592
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:38,689
    Sucker!

593
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:46,296
           Well, this should be
           our street.

594
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:47,331
               But it sure
               looks different.

595
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:53,504
                      Dad?

596
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:55,222
       Boys, what are you
       doing here?

597
00:27:55,223 --> 00:27:56,939
        You'd better get inside
        before the Doofbot
        catches you.

598
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:59,410
        I'm off to the factory.
        See you next week.

599
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:02,946
 Wow! Well, I guess
 we'd better get inside.

600
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:09,353
            You might want to...

601
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:12,256
         I mean, these guys
         might not know that
         you're not really a...

602
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:13,424
                  You know.

603
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:16,727
    (CHATTERING)

604
00:28:24,804 --> 00:28:28,405
      Boys! I thought you
      were in your room.
      Get inside!

605
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:30,607
 And get your dooferalls
 back on before someone
 sees you.

606
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:33,577
  If you need me,
   I'll be hiding
  in the basement.

607
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:35,245
                That was weird.
                Let's find
                the other us's.

608
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:40,451
        And... Hey, I got a one!

609
00:28:40,453 --> 00:28:42,553
        Pick a Doofopoly
       instruction card!

610
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,555
         "Conform."
         I can do that.

611
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:45,989
           Hi, guys.

612
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:47,825
  No! They're
  replacing us!

613
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:49,560
 I must not have conformed
 quick enough.

614
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:50,794
      No, no,
      it's not like that.

615
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:52,363
        We're you guys
        from another dimension.

616
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:53,931
 Different dimension?
 Is that allowed?
             Apparently.

617
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:56,800
                 Oh, look!
                 Perry's back!

618
00:28:56,802 --> 00:28:59,903
      Where have you been?
      We've missed you so much.

619
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,573
  Phineas,
  he's not your Perry.
  He came with us.

620
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:04,875
                  Oh. Sorry.

621
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:07,544
           Wait, can I hold him
           a little longer?

622
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:14,785
          It's just that,
          well, he left one day
          and never came back.

623
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:17,254
        He's been gone
        for a long time,
        and I'm really worried.

624
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,873
         All right,
         you know the only time
         we're allowed to

625
00:29:18,874 --> 00:29:20,491
                make noise is
                on Doofens Day.

626
00:29:20,493 --> 00:29:21,992
                  So keep it...

627
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:23,794
              Are there four of
              you in this room?

628
00:29:23,796 --> 00:29:25,796
 Five, counting Perry.

629
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:27,865
               I see nothing.
               I have plausible
               deniability.

630
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:29,767
 Boy, your Candace
 is much less curious
 about what you're up to.

631
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:32,536
              What do you mean?

632
00:29:32,538 --> 00:29:34,905
 Well, it seems like
 our Candace has spent
 her entire summer

633
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:36,740
 focused on
 what we're doing.

634
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:39,343
               Summer? I think
              that was outlawed
               a long time ago.

635
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:40,377
         You guys don't
         have summer?

636
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,713
        Well, that's...
        That's terrible.

637
00:29:42,715 --> 00:29:47,417
     Summer. It sounds
     dangerous
     yet oddly compelling.
     What is it?

638
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:50,521

00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:41,304
       Were you not listening?
       Here is the crux
       of your problem.

755
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:44,307
  Think of the universe
  and all of the many
  dimensions as circular.

756
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,676
         The energy flows
         between the dimensions
         like this, clockwise.

757
00:35:46,678 --> 00:35:51,081
   Say this is your dimension
   and this is our dimension.

758
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:52,949
           You traveled with
           the flow of energy.

759
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:54,885
       So going clockwise
       would be easy!

760
00:35:54,887 --> 00:35:58,155
    Going counter clockwise
    would take 8 million
    gigawatts of energy,

761
00:35:58,157 --> 00:36:00,790
     overloading
     the local power grid.

762
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:02,692
     I have prepared
     a little song to help
     illustrate my point.

768
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:18,625
          Anyway, without the
          8 million gigawatts,

769
00:36:18,626 --> 00:36:20,876
         you would have
         to go clockwise,
         the long way around.

           8 million gigawatts

788
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:00,006
           for inter-dimensional
           travel.

789
00:37:00,007 --> 00:37:01,596
                 Then we've got
                 work to do.

790
00:37:01,597 --> 00:37:03,186
        Isabella, start
        redirecting the power.
 Aye aye!

791
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:04,921
 Gretchen! Monitor
 the Doofen Channel.

792
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:06,440
 Make sure we're not
 raising any alarms.

793
00:37:06,441 --> 00:37:07,958
             I'm on it.
        Buford, keep resisting.

794
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,377
            No!
                   Excellent.

795
00:37:10,378 --> 00:37:12,795
  (IN DEEP VOICE)
  And will somebody
  get rid of that topiary!

796
00:37:12,798 --> 00:37:13,997
      (CLEARS THROAT)
      Thank you.

797
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:18,268
 Oh, great and powerful
 mysterious force!

798
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,971
            I know you are
            just trying to
            protect my brothers

799
00:37:20,973 --> 00:37:23,473
          but I am simply trying
          to protect them, too,

800
00:37:23,475 --> 00:37:25,275
 from their
 dangerous inventions.

801
00:37:25,277 --> 00:37:28,044
     Show yourself so that
     I may reason with you!

802
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:32,782
     Maybe we should
     build a shrine to it?

803
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:33,783
      Candace, that's...

    It's a mysterious force!

806
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:41,925
       Ferb! I think we got it!
       It looks like home!

807
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:44,160
   What do we do now?

808
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:46,496
            I don't know.
            I can't believe
            it actually worked.

809
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:49,165
    Well, thanks, everyone.
    Hey, where's...

810
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:51,234
       Oh. That's right.

820
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:12,472
     Too risky.
     You've got to get back
     to your dimension.

821
00:38:12,473 --> 00:38:14,390
 We're not going anywhere
 without our platypus.

822
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:16,559
     I thought you told us
     he was just using you
     as a cover.

823
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:18,228
 I know what I said.
 I was hurt.

824
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,796
 But even if
 it was all an act,

825
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,098
 he's still
 a part of the family,

826
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,399
 and we're not
 leaving him behind.

827
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:24,384
            I may never be able
            to open this again.

828
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,368
 It doesn't matter.
 We're going back for him.

829
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:28,038
          Well, then
      you're on your own.
        Fine.

830
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,040
  Just tell us where
  Doofenshmirtz keeps
  his prisoners.

831
00:38:30,042 --> 00:38:31,908
     We have to help them!
    No, we don't.

832
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:35,278
         Yes, we do. Remember
         how we felt when our
         Perry disappeared?

833
00:38:39,184 --> 00:38:41,051
        Oh, criminy,
        I must be crazy.

834
00:38:41,053 --> 00:38:42,185
 All right,
 we can get there
 through the tunnels.

835
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:44,554
             Yes!
    Let's suit up, people!

836
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:46,356
 You know what, Stacy?

837
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:48,024
      I'm tired of
      the mysterious force
      pushing me around.

838
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:50,193
 I'm going to show it
 who's boss.
           Candace, wait!

839
00:38:50,195 --> 00:38:51,328
      I will try to keep it open
      for as long as possible

840
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:54,064
              but the window
              is very unstable.

841
00:38:54,066 --> 00:38:55,965
          Even the slightest
          disturbance will
          cause it to collapse.

842
00:38:59,905 --> 00:39:02,038
 Like that, for instance.
         Hey, Candace.

843
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,908
   You guys are so...
   Wait, why are there
   four of you?

844
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,409
 Oh, these guys are
 from this dimension.

845
00:39:06,411 --> 00:39:07,777
   Are we inside
   the mysterious force?

846
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:09,144
  I'm not sure
  I understand
 the question.

847
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:11,881
    And why is Isabella
    suddenly fashionable?

848
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:13,149
              What do you mean,
              "suddenly"?

849
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,416
       Seriously,
       where are we?

850
00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:16,920
   Candace, I'm sure you have
   a million questions,

851
00:39:16,922 --> 00:39:18,455
       but right now we have
       to save Perry from being
       turned into a cyborg.

852
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:19,923
            What?
      We'll explain on the way.

853
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:21,291
       So, how do I dress
       in your dimension?

854
00:39:21,293 --> 00:39:24,027
        Hey, is that me?
        I look good!

855
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:25,862
            Oh, no.
            You two stay here.

856
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,497
    But we want to help.
              That's an order!

857
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:35,405
 CANDACE: Wait,
 so in this dimension,
 Perry is a secret agent?

858
00:39:35,407 --> 00:39:37,507
         No, in this dimension
         he's a cyborg.

859
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:39,309
 So, where is he an agent?

860
00:39:39,311 --> 00:39:41,077
           That would be
           in our dimension.

861
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,278
           But we're not in
           our dimension now.

862
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,482
 Okay, I'm having trouble
 processing this.

863
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:47,150
           Now I wish
           I hadn't thrown away
           that pamphlet.

864
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:50,203
         And why are we
         in mine cars?

865
00:39:50,204 --> 00:39:52,121
     This'll take us as far
     as the underground
     entrance

866
00:39:52,124 --> 00:39:53,724
    to Doof's headquarters.

867
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,325
         From there we go up
         the ventilation shaft.

868
00:39:55,327 --> 00:39:57,227
          The detainment center
          is on level four.

869
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:58,661
 And the snack bar's
 on level five!

870
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:00,597
  If there's time.

871
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:03,166
                  Buford.

872
00:40:03,168 --> 00:40:04,667
  I'm just gonna
  get some nachos.

873
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:15,245
 So, if there's another me
 and another them,

874
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:18,581
 then there must also be
 a Jeremy Johnson here,
 too, right?

875
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,984
        Huh? Oh, yeah,
        Johnson, Jeremy.

876
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:23,420
       Leads a three-man strike
       team on the north side.
       Good soldier.

877
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:26,273
         Good soldier?
         That's all you
         think of him?

878
00:40:26,274 --> 00:40:29,125
      Don't you think
      he's dreamy or cool
      or even cute?

879
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:30,393
     Tell me at least
     you think he's cute.

880
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:33,496
        Cute doesn't win
        the war, kid.

881
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:37,066
  Oh. Well, I guess.

882
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:39,969
 But what do you guys
 do around here for,
 you know, fun?

883
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:41,671
          Look, "Candace" is it?

884
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:44,474
   No offense, but fun
   isn't really on my agenda.

885
00:40:44,476 --> 00:40:46,576
        You know, since
         Doofenshmirtz
    took over the tri-state
             area,

886
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:48,578
           even though
           I was a little girl,

887
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,146
           I've been focused
           on one thing
           and one thing only.

888
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:51,948
            He's going down,
            down, down.

889
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,316
 Down, down, down, I know.

890
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:55,118
    But what about BFF's?
    Or slumber parties?

891
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,719
  Or busting your
  little brothers?

892
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:59,422
      Busting my brothers?

893
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:02,125
      I spent every day
      of my life trying to
      protect my little
      brothers.

894
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:03,460
       I had to grow up
       pretty quick around here

895
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:05,094
           to make sure
           they didn't have to.

896
00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:07,397
 Gee, you make growing up
 sound like it's a bad
 thing.

897
00:41:07,399 --> 00:41:11,000
   It is what it is.
   I'll do whatever it takes
   to protect the ones I
   love.

898
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:12,535
        Aw! Thanks, sis!

899
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:14,037
       What are you guys
       doing here?

900
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:15,538
 We're here to help.
           Sir, we're nearing
           the target!

901
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,707
                 Don't move!

902
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:25,748
            Okay, people,
            change of plans.

903
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,450
        This is as far as we go.

904
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:29,151
      We're not going
      to help them?

905
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:31,238
            No, we're gonna
            get you two home
            where it's safe.

906
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,323
    But we wanna...
     Look, this isn't our
            fight.

907
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:37,994
          It's their fight,
          and you two shouldn't
          have gotten involved.

908
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,095
    Maybe none of us should
    have.
    Now we're out of here.

909
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:45,368
      I don't remember it being
      so dark down here.

910
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:47,170
             Dark?
     That's because it's a
             trap!

911
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:49,706
           And if it was light,
              you would have
          seen us and run away,

912
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:52,075
        hence ruining the trap!

913
00:41:52,077 --> 00:41:53,376
  I think they get that.

914
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:55,378
        PHINEAS: Perry!

915
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,581
      We, uh... We, well,
      came to rescue you.

916
00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:08,057
    So far it's not going
    as well as we'd hoped.

917
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:10,226
       We didn't have
       a lot of time to,

918
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:11,761
      you know, plan
      something elaborate,

919
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:14,163
     but I guess
     we could have created
     some sort of diversion

920
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:16,032
        just in case...

921
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:19,068
     (SIGHS)
     Yeah, we could have
     thought this out more.

922
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:23,239
           (LAUGHS) I got you
           and I got your
           little friends, too!

923
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:26,509
           Game over! You lose!
           I win!

924
00:42:26,511 --> 00:42:29,746
             Mark this the hour
               of your doom,
            Perry the Platypus.

925
00:42:30,482 --> 00:42:32,715
                 Three forty...

926
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:35,218
         I got one of these
         watches with just
         the little hash marks.

927
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,220
           It doesn't even have
           the numbers on it.

928
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:39,155
                 Let's just say
                 it's between
                 3:30 and 4:00,

929
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:39,455
          Eastern Standard Time.

930
00:42:43,094 --> 00:42:44,160
             Whoa!
                  (SCREAMS)

931
00:42:47,766 --> 00:42:51,134
         <i> I told you,</i>
         <i> not between</i>
         <i> 3:30 and 4:00!</i>

932
00:42:55,373 --> 00:42:56,956
     They're getting away!

933
00:42:56,957 --> 00:42:58,540
        (ALARM BLARING)

934
00:42:58,543 --> 00:43:00,543
     I knew this was
     a bad idea. All right,
     everyone in the cars!

935
00:43:01,646 --> 00:43:05,114
   Go, go, go, go, go!
   Isabella, start the motor!

936
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:07,183
                      Yes, sir.

937
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:11,187
                 I got it.

938
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,126
      You two,
      keep your heads down
      and remember your
      training!

939
00:43:17,128 --> 00:43:18,394
        We never had
       any training!

940
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:19,661
            Well, keep your
            heads down!

941
00:43:19,664 --> 00:43:21,464
  Consider yourself trained.
  This is going to be close.

942
00:43:24,803 --> 00:43:26,669
            All right,
            you rust buckets.
            Let's dance.

943
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:36,579
  Um, can you do that?

944
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:37,380
       Well, apparently.

945
00:43:43,555 --> 00:43:46,489
 I am so in love
 with her right now.

946
00:43:46,491 --> 00:43:48,224
                   What?
      Nothing.

947
00:43:48,226 --> 00:43:50,159
         If we can get
         to the north tunnel
         before they get to us,

948
00:43:50,161 --> 00:43:51,895
             I can trip
             the security door.

949
00:43:51,896 --> 00:43:53,630
         Isabella, can you
         give us more throttle?

950
00:43:53,632 --> 00:43:55,498
 It's all the way in, sir!

951
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,401
     All right, hang tough.
     This is going to get
     hairy.

952
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:05,908
 Can we make those turns
 at this speed?

953
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:06,409
    Well, we're about
    to find out.

954
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,359
 Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

955
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:29,532
       There it is.
       We should be okay
       if we can hold off
       these...

956
00:44:36,741 --> 00:44:38,074
            Can we do that?

957
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:39,408
  No. Keep your head down.

958
00:44:50,255 --> 00:44:51,688
  We're slowing down, sir!

959
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:52,889
        Keep it on the floor!

960
00:44:52,891 --> 00:44:55,425
  It's on the floor.

961
00:44:55,427 --> 00:44:57,927
 There's too much track,
 sir.
 I don't think we're going
 to make it!

962
00:44:57,929 --> 00:44:59,529
       Everyone,
       to the front now!

963
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:00,697
 We're going to have
 to cut loose these...

964
00:45:02,901 --> 00:45:04,300
        The motor's overheating!

965
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:11,974
      Sorry, guys.
      You're on your own.

966
00:45:16,648 --> 00:45:18,247
      PHINEAS 2D:
      What are you doing?

967
00:45:18,249 --> 00:45:20,483
            My job.
            Protecting you two.

968
00:45:20,485 --> 00:45:22,785
      We've got to go back
      and help them.

969
00:45:22,787 --> 00:45:24,253
        That's not our fight.

970
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:25,621
           But you just
           abandoned them!

971
00:45:25,623 --> 00:45:27,457
 We could have made it!
 We could have all made it!

972
00:45:27,459 --> 00:45:29,025
           Or we could have
           all been captured,

973
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:30,592
           and I wasn't going
           to take that chance.

974
00:45:30,595 --> 00:45:32,595
   These are
   the tough choices, people.

975
00:45:32,597 --> 00:45:33,930
           Somebody's got to
           be the adult here.

976
00:45:33,932 --> 00:45:35,832
            You two are safe,
            and that's what's
            important.

977
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:36,466
     But... But... But...
      End of discussion.

978
00:45:46,578 --> 00:45:50,747
    Man, I had my heart set
    on those nachos.

979
00:45:50,749 --> 00:45:52,749
 Look, mysterious force,

980
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,750
 I feel a little awkward
 talking to you

981
00:45:54,753 --> 00:45:58,921
   since I didn't believe
  in you at first because,
   you know, it's crazy.

982
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:01,691
             But then I saw you
             eat my friend,

983
00:46:01,693 --> 00:46:05,495
          so I've made
          a little shrine here.

984
00:46:05,497 --> 00:46:09,732
 It's nice.
 There's a banana and...
 Oh! Mr. Miggins.

985
00:46:09,734 --> 00:46:13,770
 So I hope
 this makes up for the
 whole disbelief thing.

986
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:17,306
         Are we, uh...
          Are we good?

987
00:46:19,677 --> 00:46:24,380
  Now you have no choice
  but to fix my machine.

988
00:46:24,382 --> 00:46:25,681
            No.
 That's not one
 of your choices.

989
00:46:25,683 --> 00:46:26,983
 Fix the machine!
            No.

990
00:46:26,985 --> 00:46:29,519
      Can I...
      Can I say something?

991
00:46:29,521 --> 00:46:31,888
   So, I think I'm up-to-date
               on
     the whole Perry Agent
             thing.

992
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:34,390
       Strangely, that's the
       most normal thing that's
       happened this afternoon,

993
00:46:34,392 --> 00:46:37,393
        but who exactly
        is this guy?

994
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:40,429
       Fix it!
             No.

995
00:46:40,431 --> 00:46:43,599
      Look, I would make myself
      do it but apparently
      he's an idiot.

996
00:46:43,601 --> 00:46:45,401
     Hey!
     Fix the machine!

997
00:46:45,403 --> 00:46:47,053
                    No.

998
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,704
 All right, then,
 you've forced my hand.

999
00:46:51,643 --> 00:46:53,009
     Fix the machine!

1000
00:46:53,011 --> 00:46:54,744
                  No.
       Really?

1001
00:46:54,746 --> 00:46:56,712
 When I was your age,
 I did anything
 a puppet told me to do.

1002
00:46:56,714 --> 00:46:58,047
           How old do you think
           we are?

1003
00:46:58,049 --> 00:46:59,949
    I don't know.
    One, two?

1004
00:46:59,951 --> 00:47:02,201
 You know,
 it's hard to tell
 with the one eye.

1005
00:47:02,202 --> 00:47:04,452
 Anyway, I don't know
 why you're being
 so uncooperative.

1006
00:47:04,455 --> 00:47:06,889
  All I'm asking you to do
  is make my machine work

1007
00:47:06,891 --> 00:47:10,059
 so I can invade
 and conquer your world
 and enslave your loved
 ones.

1008
00:47:10,061 --> 00:47:12,361
            See, that's just it.

1009
00:47:12,363 --> 00:47:14,397
      Why would we do something
      that would lead to our
      own self-destruction?

1010
00:47:14,399 --> 00:47:16,399
              Self-destruction?
              Self-destruct...
              Wait a...

1011
00:47:16,401 --> 00:47:18,151
                Wait, that's it.
                I remember now.

1012
00:47:18,152 --> 00:47:19,902
          They took out my
          self-destruct button.

1013
00:47:19,904 --> 00:47:22,104
           I don't know why
           I put it back in,
           but here.

1014
00:47:22,106 --> 00:47:25,374
         I'll just rewire this,
         like so, and there.

1015
00:47:26,878 --> 00:47:31,080
      It's working! It's
           working!
  It's functioning properly!

1016
00:47:31,082 --> 00:47:34,083
 Well, look who just
 became redundant.

1017
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,686
      Send them
      to their doom!

1018
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:38,454
       Yes, her, too.

1019
00:47:40,491 --> 00:47:42,024
      Yes, yes, everyone.

1020
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:44,093
       Doom, doom,
       doom and doom.
          Doom!

1021
00:47:44,095 --> 00:47:45,928
 Jinx!
 You owe me three sodas.

1022
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:47,129
        Okay, doom for him, too.

1023
00:47:47,932 --> 00:47:50,066
  What? But I'm you!

1024
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:52,068
                       Doom!

1025
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:55,071
 Wow, if I had
 a nickel for every time
 I was doomed by a puppet,

1026
00:47:55,073 --> 00:47:57,073
 I'd have two nickels.

1027
00:47:57,075 --> 00:47:59,141
 Which isn't a lot.
 But it's weird that
 it happened twice, right?

1028
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:11,487
 <i> Welcome, doomed guests.</i>

1029
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:14,023
 <i> Come on, keep trudging.</i>
 <i> Doom is thataway.</i>

1030
00:48:19,964 --> 00:48:23,499
 I would say, so far,
 adulthood gets about
 a three.

1031
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:25,568
        You know,
        this may be as
        good as it gets.

1032
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,841
       <i> And now for my all-time</i>
       <i> favorite game.</i>

1033
00:48:31,843 --> 00:48:33,676
               <i> Poke the Goozim</i>
               <i> with a stick.</i>

1034
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:36,846
           <i> Surrounded by lava.</i>

1035
00:48:36,848 --> 00:48:39,715
       <i> My second favorite game</i>
       <i> is backgammon. Love it!</i>

1036
00:48:39,717 --> 00:48:42,151
     Whoa! Whoa!
     Hold the phone.
     I could be useful.

1037
00:48:42,153 --> 00:48:44,837
      What if you need a kidney

1038
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:47,522
           or a stand-in
           for boring functions
           you have to attend?

1039
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:48,591
           Or another kidney?

1040
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:50,927
             <i> Doom!</i>

1041
00:48:50,929 --> 00:48:52,929
          Pooh.

1042
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:58,467
          (ROARING)

1043
00:49:01,806 --> 00:49:04,874
    <i> Cranky, cranky, cranky.</i>
    <i> Oh, I love the crank!</i>

1044
00:49:11,215 --> 00:49:13,049
 I'll be honest, Ferb.

1045
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:14,884
 I'm having a hard time
 putting a positive spin
 on this.

1046
00:49:14,886 --> 00:49:17,753
 Blah, blah, blah,
 two-car garage, etcetera.

1047
00:49:17,755 --> 00:49:18,487
           Yeah? Well,
           welcome to my life!

1048
00:49:21,092 --> 00:49:23,659
       Whoa, deja vu-ish.

1049
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:27,830
               Perry, check out
               that guard!

1050
00:49:28,933 --> 00:49:30,066
                          Keys!

1320

 Candace, what are you
 doing here?

1321
01:07:07,958 --> 01:07:09,724
    You got to come outside
    and bust the boys!

1322
01:07:09,726 --> 01:07:11,643
  I'm not leaving now.

1323
01:07:11,644 --> 01:07:13,561
 The girl is about to
 forgive the guy for the
 cliche misunderstanding.

1324
01:07:13,563 --> 01:07:15,697
 Well, after she battles
 these robots.

1325
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:17,665
   Whoa! This 3-D is amazing!

1326

 down here.

   Come on, you stupid thing.
   Work!

1329
01:07:56,273 --> 01:07:59,074
      So that dish must be
      what's controlling
      the robots.

1330
01:07:59,076 --> 01:08:00,942
       Maybe I don't need
      to close the portal

1331
01:08:00,944 --> 01:08:02,243
        if I could just
        take out that...

1332
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:03,645
           Oh, yeah!

1333
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:06,881

        is on the other foot.

       saying goes, I'm not...
       I'm not really sure.

1336

      Hey, hey, hey,
      where are you going?

 You know, all that's
 going to happen from
 you guys coming up here

1338

 is that I'm going to have
 a brand-new platyborg.

 It's weird that Perry's
 a secret agent, huh?

1352
01:10:04,935 --> 01:10:07,402
       Yeah, but it was obvious
       in retrospect.

        I never lost it.

01:13:29,639 --> 01:13:31,305
  Imagine how much fun
  we can have together

1422
01:13:31,307 --> 01:13:33,174
 now that we know
 you're a secret agent.

1423
01:13:33,176 --> 01:13:36,644
         Yes, yes,
         the next 15 minutes
         should be a real hoot.

1424

          What?
          You didn't know?

1426
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,583
          Didn't he give you
          a pamphlet?
     We threw it away.

1427
01:13:43,586 --> 01:13:45,219
          Does anyone
          read those things?

1428
01:13:45,221 --> 01:13:46,988
 I tried to warn you, sir.

1429
01:13:46,990 --> 01:13:50,158
         Kids, I'm sorry
         but now that Agent P's
         cover has been blown,

1430
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,126
            you won't be allowed
            to see him anymore.

1431
01:13:52,128 --> 01:13:55,029
  That's why
  you didn't want us
  to know your secret.

1432
01:13:55,031 --> 01:13:56,697
  So we'll never see
  Perry again?

1433
01:13:56,699 --> 01:13:58,266

   another way.

            It isn't safe.
            You know too much.

  so much that I could
   unknow something.

   there is a way.

 Dr. Doofenshmirtz's
 Amnesianator?

1438
01:14:08,645 --> 01:14:11,412
        I never built
        an Amnesianator.

1439
01:14:11,414 --> 01:14:14,048
      I think I'd remember
      building something
      like that.

1440
01:14:14,049 --> 01:14:16,683
     Well, that might work.
     But you'd all have to
     agree.

  forget the best day ever,

 forget the biggest
 adventure
 we've ever had,

1443
01:14:22,559 --> 01:14:24,425
   and forget
   meeting Agent P,

1444
01:14:24,427 --> 01:14:27,295
 or remember today,
 but never see Perry again?

1445
01:14:28,231 --> 01:14:30,164
           Well, we've had
           a lot of great days.

01:14:30,166 --> 01:14:32,733
