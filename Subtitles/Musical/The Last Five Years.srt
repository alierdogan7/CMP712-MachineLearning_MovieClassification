Jamie is over and Jamie is gone

12
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,447
Jamie's decided it's time to move on

13
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,928
Jamie has new dreams he's building upon

14
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,006
And I'm still hurting

Jamie's convinced
that the problems are mine

That you swore to be true?

Maybe there's somewhere
a lesson to learn

48

But that wouldn't change the fact

49
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,722
That wouldn't speed the time

50
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,201

that would be cool

or the back of a van

not from Hebrew school

had relations with each other

I think it's cute

try a little harder

I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

I thought we had a little time

156

I know.

158
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,042
Then you have to

Yeah, um...

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,208
See, the thing is, I tried to get
a plane ticket for tomorrow,

164
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,563
but the only ones
available were for tonight.

165
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,850
So, um... you know, I can come back
on Monday if you want.

166
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,891
You know what makes me crazy?
I'm sorry, can I say this?

167
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,169
You know what makes me nuts?
The fact that we could be together

168
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,561
Here together Sharing our night

169
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,200
Spending our time
And you are gonna choose

170
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,526
Someone else to be with

171
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,681

I'm not... That's not true.

Yes, Jamie, that's exactly
what you're doing

174
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,000
You could be here with me
or be there with them

To another party with the same
20jerks you already know

You could stay with your wife
on her fucking birthday

And you could, God forbid,
even see my show

181
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,810
And I know in your soul
it must drive you crazy

182

That you won't get to play
with your little girlfriends

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,764
And the point is, Jamie

185
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,890
That you can't spend
a single day that's not about

186
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,805
You and you and nothing but you

187
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,008
"Mahvelous" novelist, you

188
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,970
Isn't he wonderful? Just 28

189
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,044
The savior of writing

190
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,962
You and you and nothing but you

191
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,009
Miles and piles of you

192
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,771
Pushing through windows
and bursting through walls

193
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,609
En route to the sky

194
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,285
And I

195
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,806
I swear to God I'll never understand

196
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,006
How you can stand there
straight and tall

197
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,561
And see I'm crying

198
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,441
And not do anything at all

199
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,325
(TYPING)

200
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,811
(PHONE RINGS)

201
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,843
Yeah, hello?

202
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,962
Yeah, this is Jamie Wellerstein.

203
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,808
Oh, OK.

204
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,810
Sure.

205
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,331
Wait, who? Who told you?

206
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,721
Wait, wait, you...
you read my manuscript?

207
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,490
But how did you...

208
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,889
Oh, oh, yeah, Professor Adler.

209
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,328
No, no, no, no, that's... that's great!

210
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,405
That's, uh... that's... That's really...
It's a second draft, you know.

211
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,161
It's... it's a work in progress,
it's getting there, though.

212
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,607
I'm sorry, who... Random House read it?

213
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,888
Oh, my... that's, um...

214
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,806
That's great. That's... Holy shit!

215
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,406
I'm sorry, um... that's...
no, no, no, no, no!

216
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,925
No, no. No.

217
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,044
OK. Yes. Yes.

218
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,010
Yes, I'm 23. I'm...

219
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,403
No, I didn't finish,
but whatever. That's, uh...

220
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,291
Yes, I can meet you. Uh, New York.

221
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,047
Yes, I'm in New York. Yeah, I live here.

222
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,283
OK. Yes. I mean, I can come today.

223
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,125
Great. Great. Great. Great. Great.

224
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,089
Oh, my God. Uh, OK.

225
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,686
Yes, I will see you there. I am so...

226
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,129
...so looking... looking forward
to meeting you, Ms. Whitfield.

227
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,682
OK. OK. OK, Linda.

228
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,286
(LAUGHS) We're like friends, Linda.

229
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,967
Uh, OK, great. That's... that's fine.

230
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,400
OK, bye.

231
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,688
(LAUGHS) What?!

232
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,243
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

233
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,121
Hi.

234
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,691
JAMIE: Hey, so I was thinking
about what you said.

235
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,848
- Let's move in together.
- Really?!

236
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,809
- Jamie, what happened?
- I'll tell you later, all right?

237
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,440
Just find an apartment, and I love you.

238
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,728
I... Jamie... Jamie, wait!

239
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:08,006
Did I just hear an alarm start ringing?

240
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,609
Did I see sirens go flying past?

241
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,401
Though I don't know
what tomorrow's bringing

242
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,767
I've got a singular impression

243
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,685
Things are moving too fast

244
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,289
I'm gliding smooth as a figure skater

245
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,889
I'm riding hot as a rocket blast

246
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,641
I just expected it ten years later

247
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,041
I've got a singular impression

248
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,282
Things are moving too fast

249
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,125
And you say "Oh, no, step on the brakes

250
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,806
Do whatever it takes,
but stop this train

251
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,964
Slow, slow, the light's turning red"

252
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,323
But I say "No, no,

253
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,609
Whatever I do I barrel on through
and I don't complain"

254
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,129
No matter what I try
I'm flying full speed ahead

255
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,366
I'm never worried to walk the wire

256
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,969
I won't do anything just half-assed

257
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,562
But with the stakes
getting somewhat higher

258
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,042
I've got a singular impression

259
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,683
That things are moving too fast

260
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:24,124
I found a woman I love

261
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,921
And I found an agent who loves me

262
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,320
He's like a young Jonathan Franzen.

263
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,527
Things might get bumpy

264
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,203
But some people analyze every detail

265
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,289
Some people stall
when they can't see the trail

266
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,644
Some people freeze out of fear
that they'll fail

267
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:50,409
But I keep rolling on

268
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,124
Some people can't find
success with their art

269
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,964
Some people never feel
love in their heart

270
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,364
Some people can't tell
the two things apart

271
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:09,765
But I keep rolling on

272
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,125
Oh, oh

273
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,729
Maybe I can't follow through

274
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,363
But oh, oh

275
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,809
What else am I supposed to do?

276
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,564
Ooh

277
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,362
Hey, Mike, it's Cathy.
Uh, yeah, how are you?

278
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,649
Um, yeah, no, just two quick things.

279
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,848
I'm not going
to talk your ear off. Uh...

280
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,565
I just wanted to know if you got

281
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,291
the reviews that I sent you
from last summer?

282
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,440
Thank you. Yeah, it's really exciting.

283
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,329
Um...

284
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,642
No, the second thing was just...

285
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,647
...if you have anything
you want to send me in on,

286
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,043
I'm sort of suddenly...
free this summer,

287
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,601
I'm, like, available, so...

288
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,684
Um... Yes.

289
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,526
Yeah, as soon as I'm doing something
in the city, I'll let you know.

290
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,330
Uh-huh. Uh...

291
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,241
OK. No, no, no, no, I understand.
OK, thanks.

292
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,085
That wasn't...
that wasn't too painful, was it?

293
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,330
Right. OK. Um...

294
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,682
OK. Bye, Mike.

295
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,450
MAN: OK, ladies.

296
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,730
Uh... Mariah, Taylor, Rachel,

297
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,929
Lauren and Sophia.

298
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,082
Follow me to the dance audition.

299
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,323
And everyone else, thank you very much.

300
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,567
I dreamed of writing
like the high and mighty

301
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,009
Now I'm the subject of a bidding war

302
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,524
I met my personal Aphrodite

303
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,730
I'm doing things
I never dreamed of before

304
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,602
We start to take the next step together

305
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,606
Found an apartment on 73rd

306
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,522
The Atlantic Monthly's
printing my first chapter

307
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,123
Two thousand bucks
without rewriting one word

308
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,842
I left Columbia and I don't regret it

309
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,447
I wrote a book and Sonny Mehta read it

310
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,887
My heart's been stolen

311
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,008
My ego's swollen

312
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:37,121
I just keep rolling along

313
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,410
Oh

314
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,800
Oh, yeah

315
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,651
And I think "Well, well,
what else is in store?"

316
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,928
Got all this and more before 24

317
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,961
It's hard not to be sure
I'm spinning out of control

318
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,407
Out of control

319
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,963
I'm feeling panicked
and rushed and hurried

320
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,569
I'm feeling outmaneuvered and outclassed

321
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,167
But I'm so happy I can't get worried

322
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,887
About this singular impression

323
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,721
I've got a singular impression
Things are moving too fast

324
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,927
Hi, can I help you?

325
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,043
Yes, hi. I'm looking for Alise Michaels.

326
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,531
- Mr. Wellerstein.
- Yes.

327
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,330
Hey, I'm Dade, Alise's assistant.

328
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,801
- Let me show you the way.
- Oh, great.

329
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,328
- Hi.
- Hello. Hi. Jamie.

330
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,608
- Jamie Wellerstein.
- Alise Michaels.

331
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,201
It is an absolute pleasure to meet you.

332
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,441
- Wow, this is great.
- Have a seat.

333
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,926
Would you like a glass of water?

334
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,890
Yes. Thank you so much for having me.

335
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,970
Everyone in the office
is absolutely thrilled to meet you.

336
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,044
JAMIE: Everybody has been so nice,
from just walking in the door.

337
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,009
ALISE: Everyone's a huge fan of the book.
JAMIE: This is beautiful.

338
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,484
- I've never even been this high up.
- It's a great office. Yes, thank you.

339
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,050
That's great. Thank you.

340
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:16,201
One day we're just like
Leave It To Beaver

341
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:21,651
One day it's just a typical life

342
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:26,806
And then he's off on
a trip to Jamie-land

343
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,410
Staring catatonic out the window

344
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:39,967
Barely even breathing all the while

345
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,801
And then he'll smile

346
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,483
His eyes light up
and deep within the ground

347
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,768
Without a sound

348
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,487
A moment comes to life

349
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,443
And I'm a part of that

350
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:10,207
I'm a part of that

351
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:16,282
Next day it's just like
it never happened

352
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,727
We're making dinners

353
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,326
We're making plans

354
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:27,089
Then he gets on the
mule train to Jamie-land

355
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:33,247
Handful after handful of Doritos

356
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:39,607
Circling the apartment, Logging miles

357
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,766
And then he smiles

358
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:50,403
His eyes light up
And how can I complain?

359
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,728
Yes, he's insane

360
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,168
But look what he can do

361
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:02,367
And I'm a part of that

362
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:10,246
I'm a part of that

363
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,449
And it's true

364
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,844
I tend to follow in his stride

365
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,446
Instead of side by side

366
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,810
I take his cue

367
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,406
True

368
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,764
But there's no question,
there's no doubt

369
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,605
I said I'd stick it out

370
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:39,721
And follow through

371
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:47,447
And when I do

372
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,849
Then he smiles

373
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,725
And where else can I go?

374
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,843
I didn't know

375
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,164
The rules do not apply

376
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,644
And then he smiles

377
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,406
And nothing else makes sense

378
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,887
While he invents

379
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,886
The world that's passing by

380
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:21,444
And I'm a part of that

381
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,000
I'm a part of that

382
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,482
I'm a part of that

383
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,120
Aren't I?

384
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,440
I'm a part of that

385
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,720
(DOOR UNLOCKS, OPENS)

386
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,087
JAMIE: Hey. How are you doing, babe?

387
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,091
You did...

388
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,764
Not a very good day at the bar, huh?

389
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,971
I'm sorry. Did you at least,
uh... get some good tips?

390
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,201
- Get any, uh...
- (SHATTERING)

391
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,044
- Shit!
- Oh.

392
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,088
You look really nice.

393
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,008
Hey, uh... are you working
on anything tonight?

394
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,528
- Like what?
- You know, your photos? The dress?

395
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,728
Like... Don't you have
an audition or something

396
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,245
later this week that
you need to get ready for?

397
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,164
- I'm not going.
- Why?

398
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,846
Because, I'm not going to get it.

399
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,442
Oh, come on, did you call
your agent or anything?

400
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,125
- He's on a retreat.
- Retreat?

401
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,760
What the hell is an agent retreat?

402
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,002
I don't know. They go into the woods

403
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,970
and sacrifice actresses
to breed more agents.

404
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,484
That's frightening, Cathy.

405
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,966
- (HE LAUGHS)
- I don't make them do it.

406
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:21,445
Hey, no, look, I have prepared
a little surprise for you

407
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,206
in the form of the story.

408
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,562
- No, baby, please.
- (LAUGHS) Come on.

409
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,451
- No, I've had such a shitty day.
- No, listen...

410
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,568
I've literally been doing this for hours,
so you're going to sit up

411
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,041
for, like, five minutes and listen, OK?

412
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,841
You know, if I had known
there were going to be this many stories,

413
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,044
- I wouldn't have ever dated a writer.
- (LAUGHS) Well, too late.

414
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,249
(LAUGHS) You're going
to like it. I promise.

415
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,767
It's a Christmas story.
You like Christmas.

416
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,567
I call it the Story of Schmuel,
the Tailor of Klimovich.

417
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,207
Schmuel would work till half-past ten

418
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,840
At his tailor shop in Klimovich

419
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,367
Get up at dawn and start again

420
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,769
With the hems and pins and twist

421
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,126
Are you going to touch my dress right now?

422
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,726
Forty-one years had come and gone

423
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,326
At his tailor shop in Klimovich

424
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,881
Watching the winters soldier on

425
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,725
There was one thing Schmuel missed

426
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,961
Are you ready for this?

427
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,891
"If I only had time" old Schmuel said

428
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,845
"I would build
the dress that's in my head

429
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,850
A dress to fire the mad desire

430
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,520
Of girls from here to Minsk

431
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:32,130
But I have no more hours left to sew"

432
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:38,287
Then the clock upon the wall
began to glow

433
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,401
And the clock said

434
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,523
"Na na na na, na na na

435
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,445
Oh, Schmuel you'll get to be happy

436
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,924
Na na na na, na na na
I give you unlimited time"

437
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,323
- It's a magical clock.
- I've never been more attracted to you.

438
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,211
"So Schmuel
Go sew and be happy"

439
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,682
But Schmuel said
"No, no, it's not my lot

440
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:05,448
I've gotta make do
with the time I've got

441
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,844
Oh, look at the time. It's time to go.

442
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,684
- (CLATTERING)
- Here we go.

443
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,882
Why do all my things
have to come into this?

444
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,008
Schmuel was done at half-past ten

445
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,731
And he said "Good night, old Klimovich"

446
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,281
Put on his coat to go
But then

447
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,920
The clock cried
"Wait! Not yet"

448
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,684
Pretty good, right?

449
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,161
"Even though you're not wise or rich

450
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,931
You're the finest man in Klimovich

451
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,560
Listen up, Schmuel
Make one stitch

452
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,769
And you'll see what you get"

453
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,650
But Schmuel said
"Clock, it's much too late

454
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,406
I'm at peace with life I accept my fate"

455
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,564
But the clock said "Schmuel!
One stitch and you will

456
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,200
Unlock the dreams you've lost"

457
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,890
So Schmuel, with reluctance,
took his thread

458
00:33:55,040 --> 00:34:00,285
He pulled a bolt of velvet and he said

459
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:06,368
"I should take out my teeth
and go to bed

460
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,928
I'm sitting here with talking clocks

461
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:14,130
Instead"

462
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,971
And the clock said
"Na na na na, na na na

463
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,851
Oh, Schmuel you'll get to be happy"

464
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,001
And then they dance.

465
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,531
Na na na na, na na na

466
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,284
No. No, thank you.

467
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,001
Come on!

468
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,730
Na na na na, na na na

469
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:31,726
"Just do it and you can be happy"

470
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,400
So Schmuel put the thread
through the needle's eye

471
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,360
And the moon stared down
from a starless sky

472
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,965
And he pushed the thread
through the velvet black

473
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:47,126
And he looked, and the clock
was turning back

474
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,284
So he grabbed his shears
and he cut some lace

475
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,530
As the hands reversed
on the old clock's face

476
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,524
And his fingers flew
and the fabric swirled

477
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,163
It was 9:15 all around the world

478
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,802
Every cut and stitch was a perfect fit

479
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,043
As if God Himself were controlling it

480
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,807
And Schmuel cried
through a rush of tears

481
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,729
"Take me back

482
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:20,927
Take me back all 41 years"

483
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,241
(SIGHS)

484
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,005
And on it went

485
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,606
Down that silent street

486
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,047
Till Schmuel's dress

487
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,727
Was at last complete

488
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,645
And he stretched his arms

489
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,202
And he closed his eyes

490
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,284
And the morning sun

491
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,161
Finally started

492
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:57,245
To rise

493
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,882
And the dress he made
on that endless night

494
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,044
Was a dress that would make
any soul take flight

495
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,204
Not a swatch, not a skein
had gone to waste

496
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,728
Every ribbon and button ideally placed

497
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,566
And sewn into the seams

498
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:22,284
Were 41 seasons of dreams

499
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,366
Dreams that you could feel

500
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,364
Coming real

501
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,010
Come on.

502
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,968
And that very dress so the papers swore

503
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,169
Was the dress a girl in Odessa wore

504
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,449
On the day she promised forevermore

505
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:49,403
To love a young man named Schmuel

506
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,641
Who only one day before

507
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,284
Had knocked at her kitchen door

508
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,485
Thank you.

509
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,530
That was pretty long, but it was fun.

510
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,727
Oh, it's not over yet.

511
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,406
Plenty have hoped and dreamed and prayed

512
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,724
But they can't get out of Klimovich

513
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,764
If Schmuel had been a cute goyishe maid

514
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,282
He'd have looked a lot like you

515
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,887
- Sorry, I'm Schmuel in this story!?
- Oh, yeah.

516
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,371
I'm not the girl from Odessa?

517
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,922
Maybe it's just that
you're afraid to go out

518
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:35,369
On to a limb... ovich

519
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,561
Uh...

520
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,564
Maybe your heart's completely swayed

521
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,007
But your head can't follow through

522
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,170
But shouldn't I want the world to see

523
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,687
The brilliant girl who inspires me?

524
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,730
Don't you think that
now's a good time to be

525
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,043
The ambitious freak you are?

526
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,086
Say goodbye to wiping
ashtrays at the bar

527
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,401
Come on.

528
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,961
Say hello to Cathy Hiatt

529
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:09,729
A big-time star

530
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,881
Ah!

531
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,041
'Cause I say

532
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,770
"Na na na na, na na na na

533
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,844
Cathy, you get to be happy

534
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,325
Na na na na, na na na
I give you unlimited time

535

Na na na na na na na
Stop temping and go, go be happy"

536
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,164
Here's a headshot guy
and a new Backstage

537
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,210
Where you're right for
something on every page

538
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,250
Take a breath
Take a step

539
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:42,281
Take a chance

540
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,889
Take your time

541
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,845
Have I mentioned today

542
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,444
How lucky I am

543
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,082
To be in love

544
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,687
With you

545
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,121
(STRUMMING GUITAR)

546
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,209
Hi.

547
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,721
I could have a mansion on a hill

548
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,242
I could lease a villa in Seville

549
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,166
But it wouldn't be as nice
as a summer in Ohio

550
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,846
With a gay midget named Karl

551
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,651
Playing Tevye and Porgy

552
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,724
(LAUGHS) God... Wow.

553
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,491
I could wander Paris after dark

554
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,883
Take a carriage ride
through Central Park

555
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,487
But it wouldn't be as nice
as a summer in Ohio

556
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,725
Where I'm sharing a room
with a former stripper and her snake

557
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,450
- I love you.
- Wayne.

558
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,886
Oh, my God!

559
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,407
I could have a satchel

560
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,006
Full of dollar bills

561
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,083
Cures for all the nation's ills

562
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,241
Oh!

563
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,566
Pills to make a lion purr

564
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:59,048
I could be in line
to be the British queen

565
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,248
Look like I was 17

566
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,401
Wow.

567
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,080
Still I'm certain I'd prefer

568
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,130
To be going slowly batty

569
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:12,251
Forty miles east of Cincinnati

570
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,207
I could shove an ice pick in my eye

571
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,489
I could eat some fish from last July

572
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:27,201
But it wouldn't be as awful
as a summer in Ohio

573
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,249
Without cable, hot water

574
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,121
Vietnamese food or you

575
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,410
Oh, baby, I love you.

576
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,847
I saw your book at a Target

577
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,040
In Kentucky under a sign that said
"new and recommended"

578
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,682
I stole a look at your
picture on the inside sleeve

579
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,925
And then I couldn't leave

580
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,643
Richard, who was with me
got uncharacteristically quiet

581
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,282
And he said, "All things considered,
I guess you don't have to buy it"

582
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:05,447
So I smile like Mona Lisa
and I lay my Visa down

583
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,968
He wants me
He wants me

584
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,010
But he ain't gonna get me

585
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,161
Damn right!

586
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,891
I've found my guiding light

587
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,249
I tell the stars each night

588
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,961
Look at me
Look at him

589
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:30,402
Son of a bitch,
I guess I'm doing something right

590
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:37,202
I finally got something right

591
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:44,649
No, it's not Nirvana but it's on the way

592
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,327
I play Anita at the matinee

593
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,960
Then I'll get on my knees and pray

594
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,964
I can state in my next bio

595
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:59,081
I'm never gonna go back to Ohio

596
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:03,404
I could chew on tin foil for a spell

597
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:07,047
I could get a root canal in hell

598
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,202
But it wouldn't be as swell

599
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:14,321
As this summer is gonna be

600
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,848
'Cause the torture is just exquisite

601
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,163
While I'm waiting for you to visit

602
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,641
So hurry up, schmuck

603
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:28,249
Get unstuck and get on the scene

604
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,006
Love the midget, the stripper,

605
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:35,722
Wayne the snake
and Mrs. Jamie Wellerstein

606
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,927
That's me

607
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,522
JAMIE: No, that one's Jerry Seinfeld

608
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,563
That one's John Lennon there

609
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,680
No, the Dakota

610
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,930
The San Remo is up a few blocks

611
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,209
Have you been inside the museum?

612
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,601
We should go

613
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,171
Meet the dinosaurs

614
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,531
Cathy

615
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,800
Will you share your life with me

616
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,601
For the next ten minutes?

617
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,043
For the next ten minutes

618
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,841
We can handle that

619
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,368
We could watch the waves

620
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,007
We could watch the sky

621
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,801
Or just sit and wait

622
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,123
As the time ticks by

623
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,529
And if we make it till then

624
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,210
Could I ask you again

625
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,364
For another ten?

626
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,562
And if you in turn agree

627
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,287
To the next ten minutes

628
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,001
And the next ten minutes

629
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,642
Till the morning comes

630
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,486
Then just holding you

631
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,450
Might compel me to

632
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:06,525
Ask you for more

633
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:16,528
There are so many lives
I want to share with you

634
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:23,089
I will never be complete

635
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:29,168
Until I do

636
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,647
I am not always on time

637
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,929
Please don't expect that from me

638
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:51,687
I will be late
But if you can just wait

639
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:55,447
I will make it eventually

640
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,843
Not like it's in my control

641
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,442
Not like I'm proud of the fact

642
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:07,288
But anything other than
being exactly on time

643
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,727
I can do

644
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,926
I don't know why people run

645
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,801
I don't know why things fall through

646
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,965
I don't know how anybody
survives in this life

647
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:26,090
Without someone like you

648
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,762
I could protect and preserve

649
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,970
I could say no and goodbye

650
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,210
But why, Jamie?

651
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:41,364
Why?

652
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:47,482
I want to be your wife

653
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:54,847
I want to bear your child

654
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:01,640
I want to die, knowing I

655
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,724
Had a long, full life

656
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,887
In your arms

657
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:16,524
That I can do

658
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:23,201
- Forever, with you
- Will you share your life with me?

659
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:27,206
- Forever
- For the next ten lifetimes?

660
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:31,524
- Forever, Jamie
- For a million summers?

661
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:35,088
BOTH: Till the world explodes

662
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,642
Till there's no one left

663
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:44,807
Who has ever known us apart

664
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:54,010
There are so many dreams
I need to see with you

665
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,602
There are so many years
I need to be with you

666
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,321
I will never be complete

667
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,963
I will never be alive

668
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:12,127
I will never change the world

669
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:20,330
Until I do

670
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,480
I do

671
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:36,647
I

672
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:42,481
Do

673
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,721
(APPLAUSE, CHEERING)

674
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,486
CATHY: Is that one John Lennon?

675
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,924
That's the San Remo?

676
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:49,762
Isn't that the museum?

677
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:57,971
Can we go see the dinosaurs?

678
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:29,169
(UPBEAT ROCK PLAYS)

679
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,330
Thank you.

680
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,571
Are you kidding me? (LAUGHS)

681
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,330
Everyone tells you that
the minute you get married

682
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,370
Every other woman in the world
suddenly finds you attractive

683
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,170
Well, that's not true

684
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,410
It only affects the kind of women
you always wanted to sleep with

685
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,881
But they wouldn't give you
the time of day before

686
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,840
And now they're banging down your door,
and falling to their knees

687
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,368
At least that's what it feels like
because you can not touch them!

688
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,124
In fact, you can't even look at them

689
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,681
Close your eyes
Close your eyes

690
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:07,841
Close your eyes

691
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,571
Except you're sitting there
eating your corned beef sandwich

692
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,688
And all of a sudden,
this pair of breasts walks by

693
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,683
And smiles at you and you're like,

694
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,205
"That's not fair"

695
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,686
And in a perfect world

696
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,729
A miracle would happen

697
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:23,521
And every other girl would fly away

698
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,162
And it'd be me and Cathy
and nothing else would matter

699
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:31,370
But it's fine, it's fine,
it's fine, I mean, I'm happy

700
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,922
And I'm fine, I'm fine
I'm fine, it's not a problem

701
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:38,050
It's just a challenge
it's a challenge to resist

702
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,249
Temptation

703
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,407
And I have to say that
what exacerbates the problem

704
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,489
ls I'm at these parties
I'm the center of attention

705
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,291
I'm the grand fromage
And here she comes

706
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,563
"Let's get a cup of coffee
Will you look at my manuscript?"

707
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,645
And I'm showing her my left hand,
I'm gesticulating with my left hand

708
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,122
And then, whoa! There's Cathy!
Because she knows, they always know

709
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,884
And there's that really awkward moment

710
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,844
Where I try to show
I wasn't encouraging this

711
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,041
Which of course I was

712
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,884
And I don't want to look whipped
in front of this woman

713
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:18,086
Which is dumb, I shouldn't care what
she thinks since I can't touch her anyway!

714
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:21,887
And in a perfect world,
a miracle would happen

715
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:25,362
And every girl would look like Mister Ed

716
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,488
And it'd be me and Cathy
and nothing else would matter

717
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:33,571
But it's fine, it's fine, it's fine
You know I love her

718
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:37,406
And it's fine, it's fine, it's fine
it's what I wanted

719
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:41,121
And I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine
it's not a problem

720
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:44,164
It's just a challenge
It's a challenge to resist

721
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:50,367
Temptation

722
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,641
Hi, Mr. Wellerstein.
I'll let Alise know you're here.

723
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:02,164
CATHY: When you come home to me

724
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,287
I'll wear a sweeter smile

725
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:13,368
And hope that, for a while, you'll stay

726
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:17,645
When you come home to me

727
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:21,168
Your hand will touch my face

728
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:27,367
And banish any trace of gray

729
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:32,763
Soon, a love will rise anew

730
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:37,323
Even greater than the joy I felt

731
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:41,485
Just missing you

732
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:46,726
And once again, I'll be

733
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:52,205
So proud to call you mine

734
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:57,321
When finally you come home

735
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:02,162
To me

736
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,681
- That was lovely.
- Really great.

737
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,684
- Thank you.
- Thank you. OK.

738
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,005
No, it went really, really well. Yeah.

739
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,282
No, I think I got it.

740
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,887
I mean, I hope. Yeah.
It's off Broadway, so...

741
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,321
Please, God, no more Ohio. (LAUGHS)

742
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,166
Um, I don't where I'm walking, actually.

743
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,288
- You have to come find me.
- (JAMIE LAUGHS)

744
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,126
I'll be there soon, Cathy

745
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,363
I'll finish up this chapter
and be out the door

746
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:38,531
I swear I'll be there soon, Cathy

747
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:42,287
Don't give up on me yet

748
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,530
I am so proud of you, baby

749
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,321
You're doing what you
never got to do before

750
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,121
And I will be there ripe and crawling

751
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:58,080
If frigging Random House stops calling

752
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,528
Don't lose faith
Don't get down

753
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:07,687
Don't despair

754
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:14,722
I'll be there

755
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,963
And in a perfect world

756
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:24,647
A miracle would happen

757
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:30,807
And that day would finally be here

758
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,280
And it'd be me and you

759
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,970
Riding it together

760
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,602
And the things we do
going like we planned

761
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,001
We're gonna make it through

762
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,366
And nothing else will matter

763
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,329
We'll be fine
We're fine

764
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,403
We're fine
We're fine

765
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:52,885
We're fine
We're fine, we're fine

766
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:59,765
I'll be there soon, Cathy

767
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:05,611
I swear I will

768
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:24,524
When you come home to me

769
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,682
I'll wear a sweeter smile

770
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,769
And hope that for a while you'll...

771
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,564
OK. Thank you.

772
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,050
I'm climbing uphill, Jamie

773
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,884
Climbing uphill

774
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,924
I'm up every morning at six

775
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,404
And standing in line with 200 girls

776
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,888
Who are younger and thinner than me

777
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:08,209
Who have already been to the gym

778
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,443
I'm waiting five hours in line

779
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:17,002
And watching the girls
just coming and going

780
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,401
In dresses that look just like this

781
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:20,681
WOMAN: Cathy Hiatt.

782
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:23,844
Until my number is finally called

783
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,128
When I walk in the room,
there's a table of men

784
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,602
Always men, usually gay

785
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,969
Who've been sitting like I have
and listening all day

786
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:42,082
To 200 girls belting as high as they can

787
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,483
I am a good person

788
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:49,008
I'm an attractive person

789
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:52,323
I am a talented person

790
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:58,487
Grant me grace

791
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,606
When you come home

792
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,683
I should have told them
I was sick last week

793
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,001
They're gonna think
this is the way I sing

794
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,605
Why is the pianist playing so loud?

795
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,888
Should I sing louder? I'll sing louder

796
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,405
Maybe I should stop and start over

797
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:13,164
I'm gonna stop and start over

798
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,044
Why is the director staring
at his crotch?

799
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,441
Why is that man staring at my resume?

800
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,204
Don't stare at my resume

801
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,249
I made up half of my resume
Look at me

802
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,686
Stop looking at that
Look at me

803
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,569
No, not at my shoes
Don't look at my shoes

804
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,529
I hate these stupid shoes

805
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:27,966
Why did I pick these shoes

806
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,451
Why did I pick this song?

807
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,931
Why did I pick this career?

808
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,242
Why?

809
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,050
Does this pianist hate me?

810
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,850
If I don't get a callback

811
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,570
I can go to Crate and Barrel
with mom and buy a couch

812
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,762
Not that I want to spend a day with mom

813
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,081
But Jamie needs space to write

814
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,242
Since I'm obviously such a horrible

815
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,606
Annoying distraction to him

816
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,843
What's he gonna
be like when we have kids?

817
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,161
And once again

818
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:53,924
Why am I working so hard?

819
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,970
These are the people who cast
Russell Crowe in a musical

820
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:01,967
Jesus Christ, I suck
I suck, I suck

821
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:06,366
When finally you come home...

822
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,249
MAN: Thanks. That's great.

823
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:11,281
Thank you.

824
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,490
Thank you very much.

825
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,409
(APPLAUSE)

826
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:22,361
Thank you.

827
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,121
Thank you. Thanks very much.

"He touched the wall
and decided he had had enough.

830
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,282
He was exhausted, first of all,
and he could feel it:

831
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,761
his lungs were throbbing and heavy,

832
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,402
and his left arm was stinging
from the shoulder right down to his wrist.

833
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:49,042
Besides that, seven laps in
and the water was still freezing cold,

834
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,601
and if he wanted to be honest
about it, he felt foolish.

01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:56,288
A ghost-pale graceless thing
flapping about frantically,

836
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:00,047
desperately trying to keep pace
with the mermaid in the next lane.

837
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:04,207
He watched her.
He watched her back stretching,

838
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,648
watched how she seemed
to ride the water.

839
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:11,964
He didn't recognize the
fierceness in her brow..."

840

I will not be the girl stuck
at home in the 'burbs

I will not be the girl
in the sensible shoes

843
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,243
Pushing burgers and beer nuts
and missing the clues

844
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,563
I will not be the girl
who gets asked how it feels

845
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,883
To be trotting along
at the genius's heels

846
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:40,087
I will not be the girl
who requires a man to get by

847
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:44,361

Her clenched jaw,
her sharp turns away from him.

850
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:55,164
'You don't have to let me win,'
she had been screaming,

851
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:58,164
but he couldn't hear it at all."

861
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,962
And the same thing happens, I'm basically
your waitress for the evening,

862
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:36,726
I'm bringing you drinks.
I get asked if I'm your publicist,

863
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,929
because everybody asks me
to take pictures of you on their phone,

864
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,924
and these people, they ask me
the same things every time.

865
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:44,570
"How did you and Jamie meet?
What's Jamie like?"

866
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:48,327
JAMIE: Baby, I'm so sorry they
ask you the same questions.

867
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:52,769
No one would notice if I didn't go.
You beg me to go and you abandon me

868
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,287
and I stand by the bar all night
and I'm drinking!

869
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,410
I'm holding my purse and I'm waiting
for somebody to come talk to me.

870
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:01,404
- You certainly don't talk to me!
- Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

871
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:04,643
God, just stop and listen to me!

872
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:09,010
Can we just, for, like, two minutes,

873
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:13,324
have a conversation without you
contradicting everything I say?

874
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:15,164
Two minutes!

875
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:17,561
And then fine, you can
say whatever you want.

876
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,931
OK, look, there are people...

877
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:26,209
And they are publishing my book.

878
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:30,610
And there's a party
that they are throwing.

879
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:34,964
And while you've made it very
clear that you're not going,

880
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,766
I will be going.

881
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,729
And that's done.

882
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:45,481
But what's it really about?

883
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:50,843
Is it really about a party, Cathy?

884
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,970
Can we please,
for a minute, stop blaming

885
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:56,805
And say what you feel?

886
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:02,284
Is it just that you're disappointed

887
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,927
To be going again to Ohio?

01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,686

this would all be much easier

889
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:13,650
Than it's turned out to be?

890
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,444
Well, then talk to me, Cathy

891
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:22,080
Talk to me

892
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:28,850
If I didn't believe in you

893
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:32,766
We'd never have gotten this far

894
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:37,725
If I didn't believe in you

895
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:41,805
And all of the 10, 000 women you are

896
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:46,363
If I didn't think you could do

897
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:50,161
Anything you ever wanted to

898
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:56,367
If I wasn't certain
that you'd come through somehow

899
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:02,561
The fact of the matter is, Cathy

900
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:07,123
I wouldn't be standing here now

901
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:17,169
If I didn't believe in you

902
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:20,847
We wouldn't be having this fight

903
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:25,247
If I didn't believe in you

904
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:29,161
I'd walk out the door
and say, "Cathy, you're right"

905
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:33,604
But I never could let that go

906
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,526
Knowing the things about you I know

907
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:41,287
Things, when I met you four years ago

908
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,568
I knew

909
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:47,926
It never took much convincing

910
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:51,846
To make me believe in you

911
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:57,881
Don't we get to be happy, Cathy?

912
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:00,122
At some point down the line

913
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,521
Don't we get to relax

914
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:04,409
Without some new tsuris

915
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:08,810
To push me yet further from you?

916
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:13,568
And if I'm cheering on your side, Cathy

917
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,927
Why can't you support mine?

918
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:19,971
Why do I have to feel
I've committed some felony

919
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:25,007
Doing what I always swore I would do?

920
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,401
I don't want you to hurt

921
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:28,971
Hey, hey.

922
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:33,330
I don't want you to sink

923
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:35,721
But you know what I think?

924
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:39,043
I think you'll be fine

925
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:43,569
Just hang on and you'll see

926
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:47,770
But don't make me wait till you do
to be happy with you

927
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:52,005
Will you listen to me?

928
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:55,960
No one can give you courage

929
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:58,566
No one can thicken your skin

930
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:03,601
I will not fail
so you can be comfortable, Cathy

931
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:10,441
I will not lose because you can't win

932
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:25,241
If I didn't believe in you

933
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:29,530
And, and here's where
the travelogue ends

934
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,565
If I didn't believe in you

935
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:39,286
I couldn't have stood
before all of our friends

936
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:43,411
And said "This is the life I choose

937
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:47,451
This is the thing I can't bear to lose

938
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:52,925
Trip us or trap us
but we refuse to fall"

939
01:07:55,600 --> 01:08:00,128
That's what I thought we agreed on

If I hadn't believed in you

01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:15,091
I wouldn't have loved you at all

Baby...

944
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,130
Baby, just... just
please, put on your dress,

945
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:29,649
and we'll go to this stupid party.

946
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:33,600
And we... Can you just do
that for me, Cathy, please?

947
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:36,081
Cathy? Where are you going?

948
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:39,449
Cathy? Cathy?!

949
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:42,126
Cathy! Stop!

they're gonna love me.

958
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,171
My best friend had a little situation

959
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:25,449
At the end of our senior year

960
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:29,201
And like a shot she and Mitchell
got married that summer

961
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:30,691
Ugh.

962
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:34,447
Carol Ann getting bigger every minute

963
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:37,490
Thinking "What am I doing here?"

964

While Mitchell's out every night
being a heavy-metal drummer

965
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,923
They got a little cute house
on a little cute street

966
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,726
With a crucifix on the door

967
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:55,248
Mitchell got a job
at a record store in the mall

968
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:59,403
Just the typical facts of a typical life

969
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:02,769
In a town on the Eastern Shore

970
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,964
I thought about what I wanted

971
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,964
It wasn't like that at all

972
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:12,249
Made Carol Ann a cute baby sweater

973
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:15,370
Thinking I can do better than that

974
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:22,441
- Ow!
- Please just drive. Please just drive!

976
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,646
In a year or so I moved to the city

977
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,804
Thinking "What have I got to lose?"

978
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:37,411
Got a room, got a cat
and got 20 pounds thinner

979
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:45,408
Met a guy in a class I was taking
with some very well placed tattoos

980
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:49,526
He wouldn't leave me alone
'less I went with him to dinner

981
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:54,722
And I guess he was cute
and I guess he was sweet

982
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,804
And I guess he was good in bed

983
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:02,809
I gave up my life
for a better part of a year

984
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:07,249
So I'm starting to think
that this maybe might work

985
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:10,722
And the second it entered my head

986
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:13,884
He needed to take some time off

987
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,731
Focus on his career

988
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,009
He blew me off with a heartfelt letter

989
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:23,164
I thought, "I can do better than that"

990
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:27,608
You don't have to get a haircut

991
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:30,724
You don't have to change your shoes

01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:34,089
You don't have to like Duran Duran

01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:35,321

You don't have to watch the news

997
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,685
You don't have to learn to tango

998
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:50,208
You don't have to eat prosciutto

01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:52,647
You don't have to change a thing

Just stay with me

1001
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:02,805
I want you and you and nothing but you

1002
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,241
Miles and piles of you

1003
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:08,370
Finally, I'll have something worthwhile

You and you and nothing but you

01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,727
No substitution will do

01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:20,963
Nothing but fresh undiluted and pure

1008
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:26,365
Top of the line

1009
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:32,527
And totally mine

1010
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,686
I don't need any lifetime commitments

1011
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:39,730
I don't need to get hitched tonight

1012
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:45,731
I don't want you to throw up
all your walls and defenses

1013
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:49,087
I don't mean to put on any pressure

1014
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:52,244
But I know when a thing is right

1015
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,562
And I spend every day
reconfiguring my senses

1016
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:01,642
When we get to my house
take a look at that town

1017
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:04,167
Take a look at how far I've gone

1018
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:10,362
I will never go back
Never look back anymore

1019
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:14,167
And it feels like my life
led right to your side

1020
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:17,324
And will keep me there from now on

1021
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:20,848
Think about what you wanted

1022
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,771
Think about what could be

1023
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:26,964
Think about how I love you

1024
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:30,090
And say you'll move in with me

1025
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:33,164
Think of what's great about me and you

1026
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:36,085
Think of the bullshit
we've both been through

1027
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:42,247
Think of what's past
because we can do better

1028
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:49,530
We can do better

1029
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:55,687
We can do better than that

1030
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:02,329
We can do better than that

1031
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,008
Hey, kid

1032
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,685
Good morning

1033
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:34,847
You look like an angel

1034
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:38,604
I don't remember

1035
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:42,685
When we fell asleep

1036
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:47,647
We should get up, kid

1037
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:51,441
Cathy is waiting

1038
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:07,481
Look at us, lying here

1039
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:11,167
Dreaming, pretending

1040
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:14,364
I made a promise

1041
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:18,605
And I took a vow

1042
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:21,684
I wrote a story

1043
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:26,129
And we changed the ending

1044
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:32,287
Cathy, just look at me now

1045
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:38,045
Hold on

1046
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:41,488
Facts are facts

1047
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:45,082
Just relax

1048
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:49,689
Lay low

1049
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:53,526
All right

1050
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:57,890
The panic recedes

1051
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:01,681
Nobody needs

1052
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:07,210
To know

1053
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:12,126
Hmm

1054
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:20,404
Put on my armor

1055
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:24,243
I'm off to Ohio

1056
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:28,003
Back into battle

1057
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:32,210
Till I don't know when

1058
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,882
Swearing to her that I

1059
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:39,362
Never was with you

1060
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:41,204
And praying

1061
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:47,367
I'll hold you again

1062
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:51,445
Hold on

1063
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:55,286
Clip these wings

1064
01:16:55,440 --> 01:17:01,322
Things get out of hand

1065
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:07,000
All right

It's over It's done

1067
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:17,162
No one will understand

1068
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:27,247
No one will understand

We build a tree house

01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,891
I keep it from shaking

1071
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:54,047
Little more glue
every time that it breaks

1072
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:58,123
Perfectly balanced

1073
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:01,841
And then I start making

1074
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,604
The conscious

1075
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:09,767
Deliberate mistakes

1076
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:16,323
All that I ask for

1077
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:20,326
ls one little corner

1078
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:23,051
One private room

1079
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:27,489
At the back of my heart

1080
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:30,763
Tell her I found one

1081
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:34,686
She sends out battalions

1082
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,211
To claim it

1083
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:42,402
And blow it apart

1084
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:47,483
I grip and she grips

1085
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:51,281
And faster we're sliding

1086
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:54,523
Sliding and spilling

1087
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:58,048
And what can I do?

1088
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:02,521
Come back to bed, kid

1089
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:06,810
Take me inside you

1090
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,962
I promise

1091
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:15,127
I won't lie to you

1092
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:19,171
Hold on

1093
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:22,847
Don't cry yet

1094
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:29,007
I won't let you go

1095
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:34,207
All right

1096
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:38,809
The panic recedes

1097
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,324
All right

1098
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:47,246
Everyone bleeds

1099
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:51,325
All right

1100
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:56,202
I get what I need

1101
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:06,760
And nobody needs

1102
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:12,927
To know

1103
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:22,960
Nobody needs

1104
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:28,604
To know

1105
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:35,727
And since I have to be
in love with someone

1106
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:40,408
Since I need to be in love with someone

1107
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:46,607
Maybe I could be in love with someone

1108
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:53,007
Like you

1109
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:31,242
Don't kiss me goodbye again

1110
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:37,050
Leave this night clean and quiet

1111
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:39,527
You want the last word

1112
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:41,648
You want me to laugh

1113
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:46,647
But leave it for now

1114
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:51,408
All you can say
All you can feel

1115
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:55,849
Was wrapped up inside
that one perfect kiss

1116
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,287
Leave it at that

1117
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:04,163
I'll watch you turn the corner and go

1118
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:10,882
And goodbye until tomorrow

1119
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:15,648
Goodbye until the next time you call

1120
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:18,280
And I will be waiting

1121
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:22,843
I will be waiting

1122
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:29,011
Goodbye until tomorrow

1123
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:33,848
Goodbye till I recall how to breathe

1124
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,731
And I have been waiting

1125
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:41,841
I have been waiting for you

1126
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:52,803
I stand on a precipice

1127
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:58,290
I struggle to keep my balance

1128
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:01,011
I open myself

1129
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:07,207
I open myself one stitch at a time

1130
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:12,569
Finally yes
Finally now

1131
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:17,123
Finally something takes me away

1132
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:19,521
Finally free

1133
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:25,727
Finally he can cut through these strings

1134
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:31,201
And open my wings

1135
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:36,042
So goodbye until tomorrow

1136
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:40,609
Goodbye until my feet touch the floor

1137
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:46,767
And I will be waiting I will be waiting

1138
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:54,284
Goodbye until tomorrow

1139
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:58,923
Goodbye until the rest of my life

1140
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:01,208
And I have been waiting

1141
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:07,083
I have been waiting for you

1142
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:17,048
Waiting for you

1143
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:28,251
I called Alise to help me pack my bags

1144
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:33,729
I went downtown
and closed the bank account

1145
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:38,289
It's not about another shrink

1146
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:43,048
It's not about another compromise

1147
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:53,964
I'm not the only one who's hurting here

1148
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:59,330
I don't know what the hell is left to do

1149
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:05,841
You never saw how far
the crack had opened

1150
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:11,408
You never knew I had run out of rope

1151
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:17,567
And I could never rescue you

1152
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:23,771
All you ever wanted

1153
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:28,926
But I could never rescue you

1154
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:33,688
No matter how I tried

1155
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:36,810
All I could do

1156
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,964
Was love you hard

1157
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:44,409
And let you go

1158
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:04,686
No matter how I tried

1159
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:07,491
All I could do

1160
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:09,762
Was love you

1161
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:15,927
God, I loved you so

1162
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:22,887
So we could fight

1163
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:28,524
Or we could wait

1164
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:34,687
- Or I could go
- Goodbye until tomorrow

1165
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:41,922
Goodbye until I crawl to your door

1166
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:45,402
And I will be waiting

1167
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:49,531
I will be waiting

1168
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:54,601
You never noticed
how the wind had changed

1169
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:58,685
Goodbye until tomorrow

1170
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:01,127
I didn't see a way we both could win

1171
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:06,486
Goodbye until I'm done thanking God

1172
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:10,042
And I have been waiting

1173
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:15,246
I have been waiting for you

1174
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:19,485
Goodbye, Cathy

1175
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:22,484
I have been waiting

1176
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:28,409
I have been waiting for you

1177
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:31,769
Goodbye

1178
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:34,651
I will keep waiting

1179
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:40,523
I will keep waiting for you

1180
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:52,487
Just close the gate

1181
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:59,051
I'll stand and wait

1182
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,521
Jamie

1183
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:07,130
- Goodbye
- Goodbye

1184
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:33,685
