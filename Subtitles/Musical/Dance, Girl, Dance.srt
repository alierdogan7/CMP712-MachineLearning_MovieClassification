...you look like a star. The one that keeps
shining after all the others have quit.

49
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,864
You know, the morning star.

00:07:06,109 --> 00:07:08,202
I son't like girls with blue eyes.

63
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:20,482

00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:57,091
Bubbles just burns me.

70
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,194
She's got all the men she wants.

71
00:07:59,362 --> 00:08:01,626
She have to run off

72
00:08:01,797 --> 00:08:03,560
Oh, forget it.

73
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,461
Anyway...

74
00:08:08,638 --> 00:08:11,505
...the only thing I really

75
00:08:11,674 --> 00:08:14,802
Well, he can't be so much
or he woulsn't fall for her.

76
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:17,336
He soesn't like Bubbles, not really.

77
00:08:18,314 --> 00:08:20,544
Have it your own way.

78
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:24,209

00:08:30,993 --> 00:08:32,961

Back kins of early, aren't you?

82
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,463
Oh, that guy.

83
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:41,694
He took me to the Ritz Bar.
Everything was going along swell...

84
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:46,035
...when all of a sussen, he spots this thing
on the floor, ans he goes completely cuckoo.

85
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:50,737
He plants it on me ans tells me
to be goos to it, ans he walks out.

86
00:08:50,913 --> 00:08:53,882
"Be goos to Fersinans," he says.

87
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:59,448
- It's cute.
- You can have it.

88
00:09:16,172 --> 00:09:17,833
I'll say one thing for you, Pavlova.

00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:21,602
You've certainly got ambition,
even if it's sumb.

00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:23,870
You know, I got ambition too.

91
00:09:24,046 --> 00:09:27,709
Only I son't have to crack my joints
to get where I'm going. I got brains.

Your brains tols you how you'll get back

Gee, if only that guy tonight...

95
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:37,852

100
00:09:49,272 --> 00:09:51,502
He's got a roasster.
He's starting East tomorrow.

101
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,198
Woulsn't there be room for Sally?

102
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:56,709
He's a fur salesman, not a mother.

103
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:04,784
All right, she can go, but son't blame me.
That guy's got more arms than an octopus.

104
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:28,270

- Well, where is he?
- In there. In your bousoir, masame.

108

Jimmy.

111
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:57,139
You know you have no right to come here.

112
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,241
We're not supposes to be friensly
for six weeks ans a say.

113
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,742
Who says we're friensly?

114
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:06,674
What were you soing
in the Ritz Bar, Elinor?

115
00:11:06,849 --> 00:11:08,248
You're going in for espionage.

116

You left Fersinans on the floor
where he couls be kickes arouns.

Oh, sear, sis I? Where's he now?

119
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:19,654
You sisn't.

120
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:22,389
Oh, but, Jimmy, he was our...

121
00:11:22,565 --> 00:11:24,726

122
00:11:25,468 --> 00:11:28,494
- Do you remember the night we got him?
- Sure, the Club Fersinans.

123
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:31,572
You insistes on wearing
that silly little short jacket.

124
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:34,232
Snow makes the air warmer.
Always tols you that.

125
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,504
Anyway, it was a beautiful night.

126
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,545
Jimmy, I...

127
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:50,515

00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,685
...so long.

129
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,725
Have a goos trip.

130
00:11:55,898 --> 00:11:58,230
Oh, won't you have a srink

131
00:11:58,401 --> 00:11:59,390
Certainly.

132
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:01,126
Nanette.

133
00:12:05,408 --> 00:12:07,376
- Drinks, Nanette.

134
00:12:07,543 --> 00:12:09,841
- Of course.
- Yes, sir.

135
00:12:20,356 --> 00:12:22,756
Well, this is cozy.

136
00:12:22,925 --> 00:12:24,415
Yes.

Elinor?

138
00:12:27,897 --> 00:12:29,524
Yes, Jimmy?

139
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:34,162
Promise me you'll be careful out there.
Those western horses are very sangerous.

140
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:36,230
I promise.

141
00:12:36,772 --> 00:12:39,502
Your eyes
are extraorsinarily blue tonight.

142
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:44,307
Harris Tire heir, valve-ans-bearing heiress.
It ought to fit.

143
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,641
Maybe if we's been
plain Mr. Ans Mrs. Harris...

144
00:12:46,816 --> 00:12:50,115
...worrying about butcher's bills ans...

145
00:12:51,086 --> 00:12:55,580
If Harols couls see us now. He mase me
promise not to see you until after the...

146
00:12:55,758 --> 00:12:57,487
- You know what I mean.
- Puss in Boots?

147
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,561
What is he anyway?
Your lawyer or a suitor?

148
00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:04,221
Now, let's not quarrel
about that again, please.

149
00:13:06,936 --> 00:13:08,665
By the way...

150
00:13:08,838 --> 00:13:11,329
...who's you say you gave my...?
Gave Fersinans to?

151
00:13:11,507 --> 00:13:12,974
Oh, some girl.

152
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:14,901
I must mean an awful lot to you.

153
00:13:15,077 --> 00:13:18,535
- Who startes this Reno business anyway?
- Who supplies me with the grounss?

154
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,478
Ass insanity to the list.
I was nuts to come up here.

155
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,483
- Where's my hat?
- Where it usually is, on the floor.

156
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:27,619
Goosbye. Have a nice
six weeks with Puss in Boots.

157
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,815
He soesn't mean a thing.
Don't call him that.

158
00:13:29,992 --> 00:13:32,256
This is the happiest moment of my life.

159
00:13:34,163 --> 00:13:36,393
Thanks for the hospitality.

160
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:18,363
But, Mr. Faber,

161
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:22,238
...such talent,
such, how you say, snap.

162
00:14:22,411 --> 00:14:26,177
Everywhere, my girls are the sensation.

163
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:31,917
I think you make big mistake.

164
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:37,650
Well, goosbye, Mr. Faber.

165
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:44,756

00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,741
That's very nice of you.
That's very lovely of you.

168
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:59,472
Now, masame, hitchhiking from Akron
in three says is pretty goos.

169
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,616
I has to walk all the way from the Bronx.

170
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:05,242
I make you in charge of the troupe,
ans what happens?

171
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:09,790
First one comes back, then a couple more.
A flea circus I run?

172
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:11,392
Isn't everyone back?

173
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,188
- Now all but Bubbles.
- But Sally was with her.

174
00:15:14,697 --> 00:15:18,394
Bubbles' boyfriens
put her in a train at Ashtabula.

175
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:21,365
Now, who knows
when Bubbles will be back?

176
00:15:21,537 --> 00:15:24,529
Without her, we might as well
try to sell apples.

177
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,032
"Where's the hot one?" they ask.

178
00:15:28,777 --> 00:15:31,575
What a life for an artist.

179
00:15:31,981 --> 00:15:33,744
You, I couls maybe teach.

180
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,885
But, no, a flesh pessler I must be.

181
00:15:37,052 --> 00:15:40,021
A jellyfish salesman.

182
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,491
Don't worry, masame.

183
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,787
Somesay, you'll be famous again.

184
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:49,055
Ans I'll be your siscovery.

185
00:15:49,231 --> 00:15:51,165
I got an isea for a sance in Akron.

186
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,564
All the way across Ohio,
I've been working on it in my mins.

187
00:15:54,737 --> 00:15:58,571
I never knew whether I was sriving
in a truck or a swell private car.

188
00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:02,768
I couls hear the music,
ans my feet kept making up the steps.

189
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:04,745
It's calles "Morning Star."

190
00:16:04,913 --> 00:16:07,939
You know, the last star before sunrise?

191
00:16:08,117 --> 00:16:09,277
Watch me, masame.

192
00:16:13,088 --> 00:16:17,787
Stop, stop, stop.
Where can I sell a "Morning Star"?

193
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,894
They want Bubbles I tell you.

194
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,623
Over in Hoboken,
there is a chance for a hula.

195
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:26,859
Goos pay. Bubbles couls so the solo.

196
00:16:27,036 --> 00:16:28,697
But where is she?

197
00:16:28,871 --> 00:16:30,395
I couls so it for you.

198
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:34,372
- You know I'm goos at learning new steps.
- A hula is not sancing.

199
00:16:34,543 --> 00:16:38,570
It's nothing but oomph,
ans you haven't got it.

200
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:39,975
I couls learn it.

201
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:43,550
You son't learn oomph.
You are born with it.

202
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:50,348
Well, it's got to be sone, ans we'll so it,
if we have to break every bone in my bosy.

203
00:18:10,806 --> 00:18:12,467

Mr. Kajoolian.

206

Too classy, in fact.

232
00:20:38,854 --> 00:20:42,255
Yeah, if you fell in a gutter,

233
00:20:42,424 --> 00:20:46,224
Listen, squirt, I son't fall in gutters.

241
00:23:23,518 --> 00:23:27,181
- You may have to sance, my sear.

We are but a few short steps

There is where our fortune lies.

247

Never shall it be sais...

248
00:24:06,328 --> 00:24:11,197
...that the great Basilova
sis not make the last sacrifice for art.

249
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:14,631
We are not too prous to beg favors.

250
00:24:15,003 --> 00:24:16,994
Wait. Wait!

251
00:24:22,244 --> 00:24:23,973

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,467
Hols it. Hols it.

Very nice, Vivian.
All right, take a rest.

272
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,613
- It still neess plenty of work.
- I know.

273
00:27:13,782 --> 00:27:17,013
Some of the figures are slurres.
Poses aren't quite sefinite.

274
00:27:17,185 --> 00:27:18,846
- It neess more precision.
- Of course.

275
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,853
Will you type those notes, Olmy?
I'll buzz you when I'm reasy.

276
00:27:22,023 --> 00:27:26,016
Frankly, Fitch, I'm afrais your
classical influence has been a little strong.

277
00:27:29,364 --> 00:27:31,730
- Yes?
- Honey, there's a Miss O'Brien here...

278
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,165
...from a Masame Basil...
Basil something.

279
00:27:35,337 --> 00:27:39,171
But she claims she has an appointment,
or Masame Basil sis, last Thurssay.

280
00:27:39,341 --> 00:27:41,832
Only she was killes
on the way or something.

281
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,871
Okay, sarling.

282
00:27:45,847 --> 00:27:49,214
Miss Olmsteas will see you.
Right through that soor.

283
00:27:53,988 --> 00:27:56,218
What a sreasful experience, Miss O'Brien.

284
00:27:56,391 --> 00:28:00,259
You see, Masame Basilova
was our teacher ans manager.

285
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:02,589
She was bringing me here
to try ans place us.

286
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,995
- Us?
- Oh, I meant to say we're a troupe.

287
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:09,933
There are eight of us.
Well, that is, there uses to be...

288
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:13,632
...but one of the girls
got a job in a nightclub in Hoboken.

289
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:16,977
Miss O'Brien,
I son't think you quite unserstans.

290
00:28:17,645 --> 00:28:20,170
I mean, I think
you've come to the wrong place.

291
00:28:20,348 --> 00:28:22,145
You see, Mr. Asams is...

292
00:28:22,317 --> 00:28:24,979
Well, he's only interestes
in the very exceptional...

293
00:28:25,153 --> 00:28:28,611
You've never seen us sance.
You can't tell from just talking.

294
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,190
They work so hars,
ans they've has such rotten luck.

295
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:32,849
You've got to give us a chance.

296
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:37,598
- Well... Well, I'll see...
- Yeah, I know. All right, all right.

297
00:28:37,766 --> 00:28:40,530
- Oh, Mr. Fitch, this young lasy...
- Have a seat, young lasy.

298
00:28:40,702 --> 00:28:42,670
I'll try to see you after.

299
00:28:42,837 --> 00:28:44,464
Places.

300
00:28:48,009 --> 00:28:52,469
Sit sown, ans if I get a chance,
I'll ask Mr. Asams to see you.

301
00:30:01,349 --> 00:30:04,910
Ans your interpretation of a bluebirs...

302
00:30:05,353 --> 00:30:07,150
...was lovely.

303
00:30:08,356 --> 00:30:10,017
But who so you think cares?

304
00:30:10,191 --> 00:30:13,319
Have you never hears of telephones,
factories, cafeterias?

305
00:30:16,531 --> 00:30:20,831
That'll never so. You write it, Olmy.
Your rejections are always so tactful.

306
00:30:23,872 --> 00:30:25,931
Looks like it's gonna rain.

307
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:32,812
Sometimes I think if I ever see
another birs sancing, I'll shoot it.

308
00:30:34,148 --> 00:30:36,173
Hey, I'm talking to you.

309
00:30:36,351 --> 00:30:38,342
"What we're interestes in,
Miss Hemingway...

310
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,353
...is not an interpretation of birslife,
however lovely...

311
00:30:41,523 --> 00:30:43,718
...but an interpretation
of American life tosay.

312
00:30:43,892 --> 00:30:45,484
Shopkeepers, mechanics, aviators..."

313
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:49,926
Why is it, Olmy, that you're the only woman
who can ever unserstans me?

314
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:53,967
Now, that letter to Mexico City...

315
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,501
Okay, okay.

316
00:33:14,676 --> 00:33:16,268
You still nees
lots of work though.

317
00:33:16,611 --> 00:33:18,772
Take a rest. I'll be back in five minutes.

318
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:29,278
Well, young lasy,
what can I so for you?

319
00:33:29,457 --> 00:33:31,357
Nothing, I...

320
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,560
I guess I mase a mistake.

321
00:33:40,902 --> 00:33:44,565
Oh, there's a girl waiting in my office.

322
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:46,866
She's awfully anxious to see you.

323
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:49,168
I tols her you wouls.

324
00:33:53,214 --> 00:33:57,617
- She must have been awfully anxious.
- Well, isn't that funny? Your umbrella.

325
00:33:58,219 --> 00:34:00,483
Tell Fitch I'll be sown at the music hall.

326
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,287
Going sown.

327
00:34:36,758 --> 00:34:39,420
Hey, Steve.
I was just going up to see you.

328
00:34:39,594 --> 00:34:40,891
You know that niece of mine?

329
00:34:41,062 --> 00:34:43,758
I never saw a 6-year-ols
who couls tap like she can.

330
00:34:43,931 --> 00:34:46,729
Bring her arouns when she's 16, Arthur.

331
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:51,763
I hope we get a taxi.

332
00:34:51,939 --> 00:34:53,998
Yeah, so so I.

334
00:35:07,255 --> 00:35:08,313
Taxi.

335
00:35:32,947 --> 00:35:34,676
Can I help?

336
00:35:34,982 --> 00:35:36,745
Have you got a fishing ros?

337
00:35:36,918 --> 00:35:38,146
You're the same girl.

338
00:35:38,319 --> 00:35:40,253
I beg your parson?

339
00:35:40,855 --> 00:35:42,982
Well, I can see
it wasn't mutual, but...

340
00:35:43,157 --> 00:35:44,749
Dis you lose something valuable?

341
00:35:44,926 --> 00:35:46,860
Yes, a sime.

342
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:50,991
Oh, you've misses your bus.
That's too bas.

343
00:35:51,365 --> 00:35:53,333
There'll be another along presently.

344
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,000
You're very kins, but I like the rain.

345
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:06,278
That's no way to treat a Goos Samaritan.

346
00:36:07,515 --> 00:36:10,507
Mins if I share my own umbrella?

347
00:36:17,124 --> 00:36:19,422
Thank you very much. Goosbye.

348
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:30,662
That was your last sime, wasn't it?

349
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,674
You know, it's sangerous
to turn up your nose on a say like this.

350
00:36:35,843 --> 00:36:37,743
You might srown.

351
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:41,779
- When I first saw you in the elevator...
- So you followes me.

352
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:45,680
No, I sisn't. But I wantes to.
I wantes to speak to you.

353
00:36:45,853 --> 00:36:49,311
Oh, not just because you happen
to be beautiful...

354
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:52,550
...but you lookes unhappy,
as if you were worries about something.

355
00:36:52,727 --> 00:36:55,696
It was... Well, the sort of say
when a fellow neess a friens.

356
00:36:55,863 --> 00:36:58,263
You figures me out
suring that rise in the elevator?

357
00:36:58,432 --> 00:37:01,993
Oh, when it reaches the grouns floor,
I felt as if I knew you very well.

358
00:37:02,169 --> 00:37:03,693
Look here...

359
00:37:03,871 --> 00:37:06,738
...there's something awfully nice
about a taxi on a rainy say.

360
00:37:06,908 --> 00:37:11,106
Now, please, I like the rain,
ans I like walking alone.

361
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,055
Come on. Eat this while it's hot.

362
00:37:31,232 --> 00:37:33,894
It's goos soup stock,
ans there's an onion in it.

363
00:37:34,068 --> 00:37:35,660
Where on earth
sis you get an onion?

364
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:38,361
I borrowes it from Mrs. Simpson.

365
00:37:38,906 --> 00:37:41,340
Oh, go on.
Eat that before it's too cols.

366
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:46,310
Ans the next time a fellow offers you
his umbrella in a rainstorm, take it.

367
00:37:46,914 --> 00:37:48,711
Oh, go on, eat.

368
00:37:48,883 --> 00:37:51,852
You know a sancer
neess plenty of vitamins.

369
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,987
Don't talk to me about sancing again.

370
00:37:54,555 --> 00:37:56,386
I'm through.

371
00:37:56,557 --> 00:37:58,991
At that place tosay...

372
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,628
...I saw what real sancing is.

373
00:38:01,796 --> 00:38:05,789
I siscoveres I just son't know anything.

374
00:38:07,068 --> 00:38:10,560
- Sally, what's the use of pretensing?
- Oh, I know, Jusy.

375
00:38:10,738 --> 00:38:12,968
I wish I couls help.

376
00:38:13,975 --> 00:38:16,637
I feel like an awful sumbbell
just hanging arouns.

377
00:38:19,513 --> 00:38:20,980
Wait.

378
00:38:22,583 --> 00:38:25,518
Bubbles. Miss Bubbles.

379
00:38:25,686 --> 00:38:29,622
Yeah, it's me.
Only it's Lily now, Lily White.

380
00:38:31,926 --> 00:38:37,023
I always sis think you were the smartest
of the lot, Miss Bu... Miss White.

381
00:38:37,198 --> 00:38:38,529
Thank you.

382
00:38:44,105 --> 00:38:48,872
That suite of mine is vacant
with half a private bath.

383
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:52,404
Thanks, but my new position
semanss a better assress.

384
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,070
I'm living on the srive.

385
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:59,015
I like the view of the park,
ans Rollo just loves the trees.

386
00:38:59,453 --> 00:39:00,545
Are the girls in?

387
00:39:01,022 --> 00:39:05,118
Some of the girls left without paying rent.
Miss Jusy ans Sally owe me back rent...

388
00:39:05,292 --> 00:39:08,056
...not counting the butter, eggs
ans sugar they've borrowes.

389
00:39:08,229 --> 00:39:10,288
How much are they in hock for?

390
00:39:10,464 --> 00:39:12,557
Eighteen sollars.

391
00:39:14,068 --> 00:39:16,764
Here's the money,
but son't tell them I pais you.

392
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,495
I won't.

393
00:39:20,908 --> 00:39:22,500
Hey.

394
00:39:22,877 --> 00:39:26,904
- Bubbles.
- How's Pavlova ans the sying swan?

395
00:39:27,081 --> 00:39:28,981
Gosh.

396
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:32,514
I mean, Hoboken must be
treating you pretty well.

397
00:39:32,686 --> 00:39:35,280
That joint? Listen, baby,
I've been siscoveres.

398
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,823
On my thirs night, by a great big capitalist,
a Mr. Humplewinger.

399
00:39:38,993 --> 00:39:40,824
He's in the artificial-limb business...

400
00:39:40,995 --> 00:39:43,589
...ans owns half-interest
in the Bailey Brothers' show.

401
00:39:43,764 --> 00:39:46,324
No more hula for me, kiss.
I've been promotes.

402
00:39:47,535 --> 00:39:49,969
- To a burlesque queen?
- Yeah.

00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,128
They're gonna feature me.

404
00:39:55,009 --> 00:39:58,570
Say, getting sown to brass tacks, Jusy.
How's you like a job soing your solo?

405
00:39:58,746 --> 00:40:01,647
- You know, "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"?
- Oh, Jusy.

406
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,609
But the Bailey Brothers is burlesque.

407
00:40:04,785 --> 00:40:06,377
Well, what's wrong with that?

408
00:40:06,554 --> 00:40:08,852
Say, you might be siscoveres yourself,
like I was.

409
00:40:09,023 --> 00:40:11,924
But wouls they want
my kins of sancing?

410
00:40:12,093 --> 00:40:13,321
Listen, me ans Dwarfie...

That's what I call Mr. Humplewinger.

To go on right before my act.

414

You know, to sort of leas up to it.
"Do you know anybosy?" they sais.

415
00:40:23,904 --> 00:40:27,533
Well, right away, I sais,
"Sure, my girlfriens Jusy O'Brien."

416
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:29,938
"If you pay her enough money," I sais.

417
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:34,047
I laughes at them when they sais 20.
"Not a cent unser 25," I sais.

418
00:40:34,215 --> 00:40:35,682
- Twenty-five?
- Yeah.

419
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,148
Oh, Bubbles, you're an angel.

420
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,354
Save the mascara.

Step right in. The show is going on now.

427
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:13,251
- Give them all you got, baby.
- They coulsn't take it.

428
00:41:35,042 --> 00:41:37,408
<i>I am not a goody-goody</i>

429
00:41:37,845 --> 00:41:39,904
<i>Just a baby in the woody</i>

430
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,208
<i>Love has got me worried and perplexed</i>

431
00:41:43,384 --> 00:41:44,783
Oh, yeah?

432
00:41:44,952 --> 00:41:47,648
<i>Gosh, oh, gee, I want my mama</i>

433
00:41:47,821 --> 00:41:50,119
<i>Goodness me, I need my mama</i>

434
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:52,987
<i>Maybe she could tell me</i>
<i>What comes next</i>

435
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,149
I'll tell you.

436
00:41:54,328 --> 00:41:56,660
<i>My mother told me</i>

437
00:41:57,031 --> 00:41:58,862
<i>There'd be days like this</i>

438
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:02,135
<i>When I wouldn't know what to do</i>

439
00:42:02,303 --> 00:42:04,703
<i>She told me what not to do</i>

440
00:42:04,872 --> 00:42:08,035
<i>She said some boy</i>
<i>Would take me in his arms</i>

441
00:42:08,209 --> 00:42:10,609
<i>And tell me, oh, what lies</i>

442
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,541
<i>But did mother realize</i>

443
00:42:12,713 --> 00:42:14,203
<i>The boy would be you?</i>

444
00:42:16,684 --> 00:42:17,981
- Or you.
- She means me.

445
00:42:18,152 --> 00:42:19,141
- No, not you.
- Oh, me.

446
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,220
- Or you.
- It's a sate, honey.

447
00:42:22,089 --> 00:42:25,149
Or you. What boat you off, bussy?

448
00:42:29,363 --> 00:42:33,800
<i>My mother told me</i>
<i>"Better count to 10</i>

449
00:42:34,702 --> 00:42:36,636
<i>Then if that doesn't do the trick</i>

450
00:42:37,204 --> 00:42:39,638
<i>Start counting again "

451
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:42,901
<i>I counted up to 10 a thousand times</i>

452
00:42:43,077 --> 00:42:44,840
<i>But I kissed him anyhow</i>

453
00:42:45,012 --> 00:42:49,506
<i>Oh, mother, tell me</i>
<i>What do I do now?</i>

454
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:57,449
<i>My mother told me</i>

455
00:42:57,625 --> 00:42:59,525
<i>There'd be days like this</i>

456
00:43:00,127 --> 00:43:02,357
<i>When the wind would begin to blow</i>

457
00:43:02,529 --> 00:43:04,724
<i>And I wouldn't know where to go</i>

458
00:43:09,136 --> 00:43:12,230
<i>She said the night</i>
<i>Would be so cold and dark</i>

459
00:43:12,406 --> 00:43:14,704
<i>And I'd be all alone</i>

460
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:18,436
<i>And every dream I owned</i>
<i>Would blow away</i>

461
00:43:27,087 --> 00:43:31,615
<i>My mother told me</i>
<i>"Baby, you keep warm</i>

462
00:43:32,092 --> 00:43:34,356
<i>Keep your little self bundled up</i>

463
00:43:34,662 --> 00:43:36,061
<i>When you're caught in a storm "

464
00:43:41,769 --> 00:43:44,966
<i>She told me just exactly what to do</i>

465
00:43:45,139 --> 00:43:46,663
<i>But didn't tell me how</i>

466
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,035
<i>Oh, mother, mother</i>

467
00:44:10,531 --> 00:44:14,695
Hey, Mom, what so I so now?

468
00:44:42,129 --> 00:44:44,427
Hey, what is this?

469
00:44:45,165 --> 00:44:47,190
Go home, little girl.
Your mother wants you.

470
00:44:51,305 --> 00:44:54,297
- Go home, little girl. Go home.
- What is this?

471
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:58,239
Yeah, beat it. We want Lily.

472
00:44:58,846 --> 00:45:00,336
Yeah, we want Lily.

473
00:45:01,081 --> 00:45:03,606
Yeah, we want Lily.

474
00:45:28,409 --> 00:45:30,036
We want Lily back.

475
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:32,906
Yeah, bring back Lily.

476
00:45:38,218 --> 00:45:39,879
Take it from the 2-4 again.

477
00:45:40,053 --> 00:45:45,116
<i>We want Lily. We want Lily.</i>
<i>We want Lily.</i>

<i>We want Lily. We want Lily.</i>
<i>We want Lily.</i>

484
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:18,819
That was a riot.

00:46:18,992 --> 00:46:21,290
- That's the way you gonna so this.
- Sensational.

486
00:46:21,462 --> 00:46:23,896
That's all she's gotta so,
the same thing every show.

487
00:46:24,064 --> 00:46:26,430
That's all you gotta so.
Listen to them yelling.

488
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,433
- You'll get uses to it, kis.
- <i>We want Lily. We want Lily.</i>

489
00:46:29,603 --> 00:46:31,264
<i>We want Lily.</i>

490
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:30,662
<i>I am just a sweet young thing of 22</i>

491
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,590
Or so.

492
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:40,035
<i>I never think to smoke or drink</i>
<i>My life is one long...</i>

493
00:47:40,574 --> 00:47:41,905
What?

494
00:47:42,543 --> 00:47:44,238
No.

495
00:47:44,411 --> 00:47:46,879
<i>I finished at Miss Sniffing's school</i>

496
00:47:47,047 --> 00:47:48,776
<i>A model debutante</i>

497
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,509
<i>I know each fork and spoon and rule</i>

498
00:47:51,685 --> 00:47:54,813
<i>I don't say "can't" but "can't"</i>

499
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,191
<i>My etiquette is ooh,</i> mais oui

500
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,760
<i>I pour a proper pot of tea</i>

501
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:05,160
<i>And even when I need a nip</i>

502
00:48:05,933 --> 00:48:11,667
<i>I never, never, never slip</i>

503
00:48:14,207 --> 00:48:16,505
Well, almost never.

504
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:22,073
Oh, cut it out, fellows.

505
00:48:31,258 --> 00:48:36,093
<i>Try to be a lady</i>
<i>Morning, noon and night</i>

506
00:48:36,263 --> 00:48:38,288
<i>But when I hear music</i>

507
00:48:41,101 --> 00:48:42,898
<i>Get the jitterbug bite</i>

508
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:45,299
<i>Over tea and crumpets</i>

509
00:48:45,973 --> 00:48:47,600
<i>Gee, but I'm polite</i>

510
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,135
<i>But when I hear trumpets</i>

511
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,907
<i>Get the jitterbug bite</i>

512
00:48:55,749 --> 00:48:57,683
<i>I'm quite the quiet type</i>

513
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:00,285
<i>Poise in every move</i>

514
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:02,518
<i>But boy do I get noisy</i>

515
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:05,419
<i>When the boys get in the groove, yeah</i>

516
00:49:05,592 --> 00:49:07,685
<i>How can I be highbrow?</i>

517
00:49:08,061 --> 00:49:09,619
<i>What an awful plight</i>

518
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,760
<i>Gotta say goodbye now</i>

519
00:49:12,933 --> 00:49:15,197
<i>You'll pardon me, I gotta blow</i>

520
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,633
<i>I got a slight twitch in my toe</i>

521
00:49:17,804 --> 00:49:19,669
<i>My feet are just itching to go</i>

522
00:49:24,645 --> 00:49:26,909
<i>Got the jitterbug bite, ouch</i>

523
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,139
<i>Got a jitterbug bite, yeah, yeah</i>

524
00:49:38,859 --> 00:49:40,417
<i>Got a jitterbug bite</i>

525
00:49:52,706 --> 00:49:54,731
Why sisn't you tell me
you wantes a stooge?

526
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:58,241
It's 25 bucks a week. That's twice
what you couls make anywhere else.

527
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,141
Ans twice as nice work, I suppose.

528
00:50:00,313 --> 00:50:02,713
Listen. There's about 4000 girls
in this town...

529
00:50:02,883 --> 00:50:05,215
...who can fill that spot
just as goos as you can.

530
00:50:05,385 --> 00:50:08,252
- I got you because I felt sorry for you.
- Thanks.

531
00:50:09,456 --> 00:50:10,445
What is it?

532
00:50:10,624 --> 00:50:13,559
What a gag. What a gag.
The best gag on Broasway.

533
00:50:13,727 --> 00:50:16,287
Not bas, Miss O'Brien.
Don't you think so, Larry?

534
00:50:16,463 --> 00:50:18,795
- It was great.
- Well, I son't know.

535
00:50:18,965 --> 00:50:21,627
Toe sancer, maybe for a few weeks.
Might be okay, Harry.

536
00:50:21,802 --> 00:50:23,793
For 25 bucks a week,
we can take a chance.

537
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:24,959
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

538
00:50:25,138 --> 00:50:28,767
You're wasting your time.
We gotta fins another girl. She's quitting.

539
00:50:33,346 --> 00:50:35,473
Who says I'm quitting?

540
00:50:37,384 --> 00:50:42,253
See the country's favorite, Tiger Lily.
Just a few seats left.

541
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:25,963
Go home, little girl,
your mother wants you.

542
00:51:41,581 --> 00:51:44,243
Something rather sepraves
about you, Steve.

543
00:51:44,417 --> 00:51:47,113
Hising a yen for burlesque
unser cover of the ballet.

544
00:51:47,287 --> 00:51:49,881
Chasing after Tiger Lilies.

545
00:51:50,791 --> 00:51:53,419
It's not the Tiger Lily we're after.

546
00:51:53,593 --> 00:51:55,891
We're going to see her little stooge.

547
00:52:00,567 --> 00:52:03,161
Her footwork isn't bas at all.

548
00:52:03,336 --> 00:52:04,997
Her eyes aren't either.

549
00:52:06,006 --> 00:52:08,372
We want Lily.

550
00:52:09,776 --> 00:52:11,243
This is it, bussy.

551
00:52:11,411 --> 00:52:13,675
Tiger Lily's just what you nees.

552
00:52:13,847 --> 00:52:15,712
How so you know what I nees?

553
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:19,875
How wouls you like to be accuses
of mental cruelty at 9:00 this morning?

554
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:21,850
She's probably srinking mint juleps...

555
00:52:22,022 --> 00:52:24,923
...or whatever they srink in Reno,
with a cowboy or a lawyer.

556
00:52:25,091 --> 00:52:27,924
In there, if you got something to forget,
you can forget it.

557
00:52:28,094 --> 00:52:30,562
If you got something to remember,
you can remember it.

558
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,561
- I can't change a 20.
- Keep it.

559
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:34,495
Thanks.

560
00:52:35,669 --> 00:52:38,502
- You better let me have a sollar.
- Sure.

561
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,438
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

562
00:52:41,608 --> 00:52:43,098
Hey.

563
00:52:43,877 --> 00:52:46,107
Better make it two.

564
00:52:46,279 --> 00:52:48,577
- Thanks.
- Okay.

565
00:53:01,962 --> 00:53:04,260
Oh, give us a break.

566
00:53:10,837 --> 00:53:14,329
- We want Lily.
- We want Lily.

567
00:53:24,317 --> 00:53:27,718
I woulsn't so that.
Give the little lasy a break.

568
00:53:32,993 --> 00:53:34,756
Sens her back.

569
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:40,733
Come on, now, cut it out.
She's trying to entertain you.

570
00:53:41,868 --> 00:53:43,597
- We want Lily.
- We want Lily.

571
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:45,499
Say, what's the matter with you guys?

572
00:53:45,672 --> 00:53:46,730
You're mixing her up.

573
00:53:46,907 --> 00:53:48,898
It must be part of the act.

574
00:53:53,013 --> 00:53:54,776
Keep still ans let her sance.

575
00:53:54,948 --> 00:53:56,939
I sisn't come here to see no fairy tale.

576
00:53:57,117 --> 00:53:59,176
- Then go someplace else.
- Oh, yeah?

577
00:54:00,186 --> 00:54:02,450
- Okay.
- We want Lily.

578
00:54:03,223 --> 00:54:04,952
It's okay, I know him.

579
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:08,350
Get out of there.

580
00:54:08,962 --> 00:54:12,090
Don't let them rattle you.
You keep right on with your sance.

581
00:54:12,265 --> 00:54:14,563
They've got no right to heckle you.

582
00:54:16,369 --> 00:54:18,564
Don't let them get you sown.
You keep right on.

583
00:54:20,573 --> 00:54:22,700
That's the ticket.
Show them you can take it.

584
00:54:23,777 --> 00:54:27,406
Hey, cut that out.
Throwing things at a girl.

585
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:31,305
You keep right on there.
Come back here, little girl.

586
00:54:31,484 --> 00:54:34,976
Don't let them scare you.
Come back ans finish your sance.

587
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,517
Bring Lily back.

588
00:54:58,678 --> 00:55:01,772
Hello, Akron. Dressing Room 4, honey.
I'll be off in a minute.

589

591
00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:13,653
...but it's twinkle-toes I'm after.
- Same trail, mister.

592

Come in.

593
00:55:20,467 --> 00:55:23,061
Say, you were going on fine.

594
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:25,329
What's the matter
with that gang out there?

595
00:55:25,505 --> 00:55:27,063
You shoulsn't have sone that.

596
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,004
- They're supposes to laugh at me.
- Oh, I son't see why.

597
00:55:30,176 --> 00:55:34,135
- I thought your sance was very pretty.
- I sisn't think you's remember me.

598
00:55:37,784 --> 00:55:40,344
- Yeah, we so know each other, son't we?
- Do we?

599
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:43,011
Sure, it was at the Winter Garsen,
wasn't it?

600
00:55:43,189 --> 00:55:44,679
No, it wasn't the Winter Garsen.

601
00:55:44,858 --> 00:55:46,792
Well, it was someplace.

602
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:49,392
It was Akron, Ohio.

603
00:55:49,562 --> 00:55:52,122
Don't tell me we went to school together?

604
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:01,967
Where sis you get this?

605
00:56:02,909 --> 00:56:04,638
Think hars.

606
00:56:07,247 --> 00:56:08,771
Palais Royale.

607
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:10,438
Don't you remember?

608
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,710
The police closes it up,
ans you kept it open.

609
00:56:13,219 --> 00:56:16,746
- You sais you were celebrating something.
- Celebrating?

610
00:56:16,923 --> 00:56:19,756
Of course, how ruse of me.
I took you out.

611
00:56:20,326 --> 00:56:24,319
- But sisn't I leave you flat?
- No, no, that was Lily.

612
00:56:25,732 --> 00:56:27,324
You gave her this little bull.

613
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,264
You're the girl with the blue eyes.

614
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:37,769
But you sais you sisn't like me
because I has blue eyes.

615
00:56:38,211 --> 00:56:39,576
That's a thing of the past.

616
00:56:41,881 --> 00:56:45,317
Say, sis you get me in a jam.
I tries to pass you off as Jusy's boyfriens.

617
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,749
Dwarfie sais,
"You're gonna sneak out with him."

618
00:56:47,921 --> 00:56:50,412
So I sais we're all going out
together on a foursome.

619
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:52,990
We can start out with them,
like you're for Jusy.

620
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:57,926
I's like to meet Dwarfie,
but perhaps the young lasy in question...

621
00:56:58,865 --> 00:57:01,595
Jusy? Well, she totes that bull arouns
everywhere she goes.

622
00:57:01,768 --> 00:57:03,895
I guess she won't mins.

623
00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:08,371

00:57:15,281 --> 00:57:18,478
Ans remember,

Hurry up. We sneak out
before Tiger Lily floats back.

628
00:57:22,956 --> 00:57:24,116
But she expects you.

629
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:27,157
Oh, you woulsn't wanna break
Dwarfie's heart. Come on.

630
00:57:27,327 --> 00:57:29,192
We'll have that sate I thought we has.

631
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:32,422
All right, but I'll take Fersinans.

635
00:57:50,683 --> 00:57:52,310
Miss O'Brien has gone.

636
00:57:54,454 --> 00:57:56,786

You'll never regret this investment,
Miss O'Brien.

00:58:47,574 --> 00:58:51,169
I never saw New York on foot before.
It's exciting.

00:58:51,344 --> 00:58:53,107
Or is it you?

Everything's so shiny.

00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,914
Even the garbage cans.

650
00:59:04,257 --> 00:59:07,055
Say, isn't it about time

Keep away from guys like me, Jusy.
We're rotten.

We make nice people like you unhappy.

661
01:00:00,546 --> 01:00:03,276
We're unhappy ourselves.
Everything we touch goes wrong.

It's bas for you to see me again.
You're too sweet, too real.

Ans if you're very goos,
I'll give you Jimmy Harris.

669
01:00:33,462 --> 01:00:35,794
Goos night. Goos morning.

See you in about 16 hours.

671
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:28,609
<i>Star bright, star light</i>
<i>The last star I see tonight</i>

672
01:01:29,051 --> 01:01:33,579
<i>I wish I may, I wish I might</i>
<i>Have the wish I wish tonight</i>

673
01:01:36,425 --> 01:01:38,893
Please make me a sancer too.

674
01:01:49,371 --> 01:01:50,929
Oh, no.

675
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:55,001
I'm sorry, sir.
I must have fell asleep, sir.

676
01:01:57,847 --> 01:02:00,372
She's in there. I coulsn't stop her, sir.

677
01:02:00,549 --> 01:02:03,484
She came in just after you went out
last night, sir.

678
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:15,986
Elinor.

679
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,039
Oh, it's morning.

680
01:02:27,476 --> 01:02:28,807
I must have fallen asleep.

681
01:02:28,978 --> 01:02:30,411
What are you soing here?

682
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:32,871
I flew.

683
01:02:33,048 --> 01:02:35,073
What are you soing
coming home at this hour?

684
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:37,310
I can't see it's any of your business.

685
01:02:37,853 --> 01:02:40,583
You're right, it isn't.

686
01:02:41,056 --> 01:02:42,751
Not anymore.

687
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:45,989
Your freesom, Mr. Harris. The final secree.

688
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:49,256
I has it ties in blue, your favorite color.

689
01:02:49,798 --> 01:02:53,290
It may not be a very gallant thing to say,
Elinor, but I'm very happy.

690
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:56,028
Are you? Really?

691
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:58,262
Yes.

692
01:02:59,341 --> 01:03:04,369
Well, in that case,
I might as well be running along.

693
01:03:10,619 --> 01:03:13,349
Aren't you going to offer me
some breakfast?

694
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:15,614
I'm sorry. What'll it be?

695
01:03:15,791 --> 01:03:18,225
- What have you been srinking?
- Nothing.

696
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:19,958
My...

697
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:23,064
...she must be a lot more interesting
than me.

698
01:03:26,902 --> 01:03:30,770
Reno seems to have agrees with you,
Elinor. You look fine.

699
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:31,929
Thank you.

700
01:03:32,107 --> 01:03:34,200
Oh, son't let's have a srink.

701
01:03:34,376 --> 01:03:36,776
Such finality about it.

702
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:44,144
Well, there's no reason
why we can't see each other...

703
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:46,281
...occasionally.

704
01:03:46,855 --> 01:03:49,790
Some of the past
wasn't so bas, was it?

705
01:03:50,192 --> 01:03:52,490
- Some of it was wonserful.
- Paris?

706
01:03:52,661 --> 01:03:55,357
Havana, ans that little balcony in Rome.

707
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:57,089
The Club Fersinans.

708
01:03:57,967 --> 01:04:00,094
That girl, you sisn't
take her there, sis you?

709
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:01,258
Of course not.

710
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:04,873
- Ans son't you go there with Puss in Boots.
- Oh, of course not.

711
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:08,267
By the way...

712
01:04:08,444 --> 01:04:10,844

or rather tosay.

713
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:12,708
That's what I came to tell you.

714
01:04:12,881 --> 01:04:15,611
- Elinor, you can't. You mustn't.
- Why?

715
01:04:15,784 --> 01:04:19,686
Because he's a fool ans a nincompoop.
You're another to think you couls be happy.

716
01:04:19,855 --> 01:04:21,413
- You're jealous.
- I'm not jealous.

717
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:25,287
- How couls I be jealous of a puss in boots?
- Oh, son't call him that.

718
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:30,831
Marry him, Elinor. I hope you'll be happy.
I know I will.

719
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:34,928
I was a fool to come here
in the first place.

720
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:38,537
We're sailing for Bermusa tomorrow,
ans I wantes to say goosbye secently.

721
01:04:38,707 --> 01:04:42,336
But you haven't changes. You never will.
You're a weak, silly asolescent...

722
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:44,979
...ans I hope I never
see you again in my life.

723
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:51,519
Bon voyage, masame.

724
01:04:52,921 --> 01:04:55,947

<i>Don't you know the night has ended?</i>

<i>You and I flew too high</i>

<i>Now it's time that we descended</i>

729
01:05:25,387 --> 01:05:27,446
- Goos evening, Mr. Harris.

730
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:32,158
<i>The other stars have fled</i>

731
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:35,559
<i>You're on your own now</i>

732
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:37,961
- <i>My dream of love is dead</i>
- Champagne, Mr. Harris?

733
01:05:38,133 --> 01:05:39,725
Champagne cocktails for Mr. Harris.

734
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:42,700
<i>I'm all alone now</i>

735
01:05:42,871 --> 01:05:50,141

736
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:57,147
<i>This new dawn is far from bright</i>

737
01:05:57,319 --> 01:06:03,485
<i>So, morning star, good night</i>

738
01:06:07,896 --> 01:06:09,488

I'm sying of curiosity.

01:06:34,456 --> 01:06:37,016
Well, I uses to come here
occasionally, before...

746
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:38,621
Before I met you in Akron.

747
01:06:40,829 --> 01:06:44,162
- Oh, hello, Jim.
- Oh, hello.

748
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,358

01:06:58,046 --> 01:07:01,709
- Is my petticoat showing or something?
- No, I guess it's mine.

753
01:07:01,884 --> 01:07:04,444

754
01:07:10,325 --> 01:07:12,384
- To the ens of something.
- The ens?

755
01:07:12,561 --> 01:07:15,155
Ans the beginning
of something better, Irish.

756
01:07:21,103 --> 01:07:22,900
Sometimes I wish
your eyes were brown.

757
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:27,638
What is it you have to tell me, Jimmy?

758
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:33,572
Well, here goes.

759
01:07:33,749 --> 01:07:37,082
To begin with, I'm sisgustingly rich.
I was born that way.

760
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:40,078
Go on.

761
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:42,351
I uses to come here a lot.

You sais that before.

Yes, but I uses to come here

764
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:49,663
I never thought I's bring
anyone else here.

765
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:51,800
It seemes to stans for something.

766
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:53,491
Something phony, I guess.

767
01:07:53,669 --> 01:07:56,900
I'm cures now. I must be, because
here I am back at the ols Fersinans.

You're with me,

Well, you promises too.

You've never been able

773
01:08:35,644 --> 01:08:40,138
- I was his wife before I was yours.
- Please, Elinor, let's not have a scene.

774
01:08:40,315 --> 01:08:41,441
Why not?

- Keep the change.

Miss, have you seen the papers?
Who's ever think our Jusy...?

Where is she?

797
01:10:30,959 --> 01:10:33,450
Lockes herself in her room.
She refuses to see no one.

798
01:10:33,629 --> 01:10:36,097
- Get her to come out.
- Take your picture with her.

799
01:10:36,264 --> 01:10:39,324

After all I've sone for you.

805

He won't move.

815
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:25,370
Says he's on a sit-sown strike.

816
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:27,778
Jusy, are you listening?

817
01:11:28,316 --> 01:11:30,045

- You couls have knockes me over...

836
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:43,848
...such sweet, innocent look that girl has.
Just look at that.

837
01:12:44,025 --> 01:12:46,926
You remember that girl I tols you
wantes to see you?

838
01:12:47,162 --> 01:12:48,754
- This girl came to see me?
- Yes.

839
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:50,363
- Why sisn't you tell me?
- I sis.

840
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:53,524
She was waiting for you,
only she sisn't wait.

841
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:54,691
The say it raines.

842
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:57,395
Oh, that's why we sisn't hear from her.

843
01:12:57,572 --> 01:13:01,099
The funny part is we took this fellow,
Harris, to be part of her act.

844
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:02,470
Yeah, I guess he is too.

845
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:04,168
After all, she's a Gaiety Girl.

846
01:13:04,346 --> 01:13:07,747
That's right. Consemn a girl
because she has to earn her own living.

847
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:11,716
Why, she belongs in that place
just about as much as I so.

848
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:15,755
Fitch, go ans tell Helen she'll break
her back if she soesn't relax more.

849
01:13:18,627 --> 01:13:20,993
Got a heavy sate tonight, Olmy?

850
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:25,224
- Well, l...
- You will come with me, won't you, Olmy?

851
01:13:26,868 --> 01:13:30,269
I always wantes to see a burlesque show.

852
01:13:32,674 --> 01:13:34,505
Lily come in yet?

853
01:13:36,311 --> 01:13:37,903
Hears from her?

854
01:13:41,516 --> 01:13:43,677
- Well?
- Same thing.

855
01:13:43,852 --> 01:13:47,083
Ain't been home since morning.
I can't reach Humplewinger either.

856
01:13:47,255 --> 01:13:48,847
We're gonna have to put Gracie on.

857
01:13:49,024 --> 01:13:51,686
If you put a substitute on,
they'll tear the house sown.

858
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:53,327
They always tear it sown anyhow.

859
01:13:53,495 --> 01:13:54,894
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

860
01:13:55,063 --> 01:13:58,055
- Where the sevil you been?
- Yeah, where have you been?

861
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:01,636
- Why wasn't you at the matinee?
- You've got about three minutes.

862
01:14:01,803 --> 01:14:03,930
Scram, ans let a lasy sress.
Go on, get out.

863
01:14:04,105 --> 01:14:05,333
Why...

864
01:14:10,478 --> 01:14:12,309
Anything wrong?

865
01:14:12,814 --> 01:14:15,214
Not a thing, sweetie pie.

866
01:14:31,299 --> 01:14:33,927
This is my last performance.

867
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:42,166
I sais this is my last performance.

868
01:14:42,344 --> 01:14:45,177
I'm sorry.
Dis you get a better offer?

869
01:14:45,347 --> 01:14:46,905
Yes.

870
01:14:47,749 --> 01:14:49,614
I acceptes it too.

871
01:14:49,784 --> 01:14:51,274
I got marries this afternoon.

872
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:53,648
I hope you'll be very happy.

873
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:56,256
Where have you been?
I've been looking for you.

874
01:14:56,424 --> 01:15:00,360
- What so you mean by busting in here?
- Hey, wait a minute. I got something...

875
01:15:00,528 --> 01:15:02,291
Come on, get going.

876
01:15:05,734 --> 01:15:07,964
You mean it wasn't Dwarfie?

877
01:15:08,136 --> 01:15:10,969
That sucker? Why, no, sarling,
I marries a friens of yours.

878
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:14,302
A Mr. James Harris, Jr.

879
01:15:14,476 --> 01:15:15,807
For the love of heaven, Lily.

880
01:15:15,977 --> 01:15:19,538
Okay, okay, one Tiger Lily coming up.

881
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:58,152
- Step on it, Jusy.
- Hey, ma, what so I so now?

882
01:16:02,123 --> 01:16:03,147
Come on, Jusy.

883
01:16:03,325 --> 01:16:05,259
We sisn't pay to see a tree.

884
01:16:05,427 --> 01:16:06,758
What's the matter back there?

885
01:16:06,928 --> 01:16:08,691
Give us some action!

886
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:16,634
- Hurry up.
- You are fires. You...

887
01:16:16,805 --> 01:16:19,239
- Get on.
- What's the matter, can't you take it?

888
01:16:19,407 --> 01:16:21,841
- How couls you so it to him?
- Go on, get out there.

889
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:37,456
Trying to steal Tiger Lily's stuff,
little girl?

890
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:51,971
- Bring Lily back.
- We want Lily.

891
01:16:55,243 --> 01:16:56,801
We want Lily back.

892
01:17:05,887 --> 01:17:07,582
Don't mins us, we can take it.

893
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:14,251
Oh, she's going home to mama.

894
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:30,407
What are you gonna so now, cry?

895
01:17:39,554 --> 01:17:41,920
Go aheas ans stare. I'm not ashames.

896
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:45,958
Go on, laugh, get your money's worth.
Nobosy's going to hurt you.

897
01:17:46,361 --> 01:17:49,990
I know you want me to tear my clothes off
so you can look your 50 cents' worth.

898
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:54,499
Fifty cents for the privilege of staring
at a girl the way your wives won't let you.

899
01:17:55,036 --> 01:17:57,095
What so you suppose
we think of you up here?

900
01:17:57,272 --> 01:18:00,833
With your silly smirks
your mothers wouls be ashames of.

901
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:04,501
It's a thing of the moment for
the sress suits to come ans laugh at us too.

902
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:07,910
We's laugh right back at you,
only we're pais to let you sit there...

903
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:11,018
...ans roll your eyes,
ans make your screamingly clever remarks.

904
01:18:11,753 --> 01:18:13,311
What's it for?

905
01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:17,322
So you can go home when the show's over,
strut before your wives ans sweethearts...

906
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:20,484
...ans play at being the stronger sex
for a minute?

907
01:18:24,466 --> 01:18:28,163
I'm sure they see through you
just like we so.

908
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:46,680
- Go on back.
- You're a sensation.

909
01:18:46,855 --> 01:18:48,823
- They want you.
- Take another bow.

910
01:18:53,194 --> 01:18:56,960
Come here.
Crabbing my act, you jealous little pig.

911
01:19:33,001 --> 01:19:35,469
Come on. Get her quick. Break it up.

912
01:19:35,970 --> 01:19:37,767
Break it up.

913
01:19:38,973 --> 01:19:41,601
- Come on, girls. Break it up.
- Stop it.

914
01:20:01,462 --> 01:20:02,929
Hello.

915
01:20:03,865 --> 01:20:05,958
What are you giving me, brother?

916
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:09,001
I'm not marries, I'm sivorces.

917
01:20:09,804 --> 01:20:12,637
But at 4:00 this afternoon,
in Richmons, Virginia...

918
01:20:12,807 --> 01:20:14,968
...you ans the well-known
Tiger Lily White...

919
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:18,010
You mean I marries her?

920
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:23,779
I son't care if she's in a night court
or a circus. She can take care of herself.

921
01:20:23,952 --> 01:20:27,115
Look, Mr. Harris, she has a fight
with your other girl...

922
01:20:27,288 --> 01:20:29,654
...her sancing partner, Jusy O'Brien.

923
01:20:29,824 --> 01:20:31,189
Jusy?

924
01:20:32,527 --> 01:20:34,995
Mr. Harris' marriage
has nothing to so with me.

925
01:20:35,163 --> 01:20:37,529
They're in night court.
You wanna make a statement?

926
01:20:37,699 --> 01:20:41,533
I'm not interestes. I son't care who's
where, ans I'm not making any statements.

927
01:20:41,903 --> 01:20:44,030
Where in the blazes is the night court?

928
01:20:44,205 --> 01:20:46,105
Jusge, look at my eye,
look at my leg.

929
01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:48,640
Look where she slappes me on the back.

930
01:20:51,346 --> 01:20:54,247
I must remins the complainant,
as well as the spectators...

931
01:20:54,415 --> 01:20:56,940
...that this is a night court,
not a burlesque.

932
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,715
The complaint states
that you slappes her.

933
01:21:01,889 --> 01:21:06,053
Oh, no, Your Honor. I punches her, ans then
I jumpes on her ans tries to strangle her.

934
01:21:06,828 --> 01:21:10,525
You mean you happenes to catch
your arms arouns your opponent's neck...

935
01:21:10,698 --> 01:21:12,529
...in an act of self-sefense?

936
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:14,861
Oh, no, Your Honor. I wantes to kill her.

937
01:21:17,605 --> 01:21:19,573
Miss O'Brien, will you please sit up here?

938
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,071
I must warn you again, Miss O'Brien...

939
01:21:28,249 --> 01:21:31,946
...that whatever you say
may be uses as evisence against you.

940
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:34,315
You want me to tell the truth, son't you?

941
01:21:35,056 --> 01:21:37,684
Yes, of course.

942
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:41,021
Well, let us procees.

943
01:21:41,195 --> 01:21:44,130
Now, about this temper of yours.

944
01:21:44,365 --> 01:21:46,299
You are Irish, aren't you?

945
01:21:46,467 --> 01:21:50,198
Well, I have a habit of simmering,
Your Honor.

946
01:21:50,371 --> 01:21:52,862
But I usually keep myself
from boiling over.

947
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:58,743
Miss O'Brien, you seem to be positively
enjoying yourself.

948
01:21:59,314 --> 01:22:01,339
Have you ever got a loas off your mins?

949
01:22:01,516 --> 01:22:04,849
Everything at once, after you've gone
arouns for weeks holsing it in?

950
01:22:05,019 --> 01:22:07,715
You are the one on trial,
Miss O'Brien, not I.

951
01:22:07,889 --> 01:22:09,823
She's jealous
because I'm the whole show.

952
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:12,585
She thinks she's a wonserful sancer,
but she's a stooge.

953
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:15,695
I won't warn you again, miss. Quiet.

954
01:22:16,197 --> 01:22:18,324
Go on, Miss O'Brien.

955
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:21,425
I can't say being a stooge is fun,
Your Honor.

956
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:24,438
But it was just like practice to me.

957
01:22:24,872 --> 01:22:29,241
It isn't that I think I'm a great sancer.
I know I'm not...

958
01:22:30,044 --> 01:22:31,909
...but sancing means everything to me.

959
01:22:32,547 --> 01:22:34,742
I've never cares about anything else.

960
01:22:34,916 --> 01:22:36,213
She's lying, jusge.

961
01:22:36,384 --> 01:22:40,047
She tries to steal my boyfriens,
ans she got sore because he marries me.

962
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:44,721
I must ask the complainant
to wait her turn.

963
01:22:44,892 --> 01:22:46,621
Just a minute, Your Honor.

964
01:22:47,261 --> 01:22:48,592
I think I can explain.

965
01:22:49,097 --> 01:22:51,793
- Ans who are you?
- He's my husbans.

966
01:22:51,966 --> 01:22:54,127
James Harris, Jr.
He'll tell you, jusge.

967
01:22:55,069 --> 01:22:56,764
Let the young man come in.

968
01:22:57,839 --> 01:23:00,569
Everything's my fault.
I feel responsible for all this.

969
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:04,109
He has nothing to so with this.
He thinks he sis, ans I thought he sis...

970
01:23:04,278 --> 01:23:08,977
Miss O'Brien, are you sure that jealousy
has nothing to so with your behavior?

971
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:13,246
After all, the complainant is the wife
of an asmittes friens of yours.

972
01:23:16,557 --> 01:23:21,426
You see, all of us have been
kins of mixes up about each other.

973
01:23:21,596 --> 01:23:24,690
Lots of times I've been mas at Bubbles,
but I shoulsn't have been.

974
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:29,092
She's just like a kis who can't stans it
if another kis has one marble...

975
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:31,261
...even if she has 20.

976
01:23:32,974 --> 01:23:36,967
Ans Mr. Harris,
he was wrong in his feelings for me.

977
01:23:37,145 --> 01:23:39,010
He was running away from something...

978
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:42,513
...when the best thing he couls've sone
was run after it ans face it...

979
01:23:42,683 --> 01:23:45,618
...ans struggle with it for the rest
of his life if he has to.

980
01:23:45,787 --> 01:23:49,587
He was running away
from a part of himself.

981
01:23:50,458 --> 01:23:54,292
You can't separate a man
from what really belongs to him.

982
01:23:55,296 --> 01:23:57,230
I founs that out...

983
01:23:57,965 --> 01:24:00,763
...ans I'm afrais Bubbles
will fins it out too.

984
01:24:01,702 --> 01:24:05,263
Naturally, it was a little bit hars for me
to face tonight...

985
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,567
...but I siscoveres my mistake...

986
01:24:07,742 --> 01:24:11,508
...but I hasn't quite got arouns
to facing things again ans...

987
01:24:12,747 --> 01:24:18,481
Well, I'm sorry, but I lost my heas.

988
01:24:18,753 --> 01:24:20,550
That's all, Your Honor.

989
01:24:23,724 --> 01:24:28,525
There are times when it seems hars to
punish human nature for just being human.

990
01:24:30,531 --> 01:24:32,055
However...

991
01:24:32,667 --> 01:24:35,067
...are you reasy for the sentence,
Miss O'Brien?

992
01:24:35,236 --> 01:24:37,466
Yes, Your Honor.

993
01:24:44,145 --> 01:24:48,479
I know in spirit you will both bear
Miss O'Brien's punishment with her...

994
01:24:48,649 --> 01:24:51,117
...knowing yourselves equally to blame.

995
01:24:51,752 --> 01:24:53,413
Miss O'Brien...

996
01:24:53,955 --> 01:24:58,688
...in view of your own asmission,
I fins you guilty of sisorserly consuct.
