KURT (laughs):
A year and a half ago,

4
00:00:51,623 --> 00:00:54,124
the New Directions were nothing
but a group of six misfits,

5
00:00:54,175 --> 00:00:55,659
stumbling their way
through a horrific rendition

6
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,211
of "Sit Down,
You're Rocking the Boat."

7
00:00:57,295 --> 00:00:58,795
Now here we are,
at the top

8
00:00:58,847 --> 00:01:00,180
of the show choir heap:
Nationals!

9
00:01:00,265 --> 00:01:03,684
I want to hit up Central
Park, get my frolic on.

10
00:01:03,768 --> 00:01:05,435
I want to throw stuff
off the Brooklyn Bridge.

11
00:01:05,503 --> 00:01:06,603
You guys, hold
on. I mean,

12
00:01:06,671 --> 00:01:07,754
we still have
two songs to write.

13
00:01:07,822 --> 00:01:10,057
Okay, Mr. Bossy Pants.

14
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:13,861
But I think we might have some
time for a tune before we leave.

15
00:01:13,945 --> 00:01:16,897
(a cappella):
♪ Start spreading the news ♪

16
00:01:16,981 --> 00:01:20,350
♪ I'm leaving today ♪

17
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:23,520

19
00:01:26,758 --> 00:01:28,358
Guys, I have news.

20
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,044
To celebrate our impending win
at Nationals,

21
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:34,464
I got us all 13 tickets
to Broadway's longest-running

22
00:01:34,532 --> 00:01:35,966
show ever,

23
00:01:36,033 --> 00:01:37,033
<i>Cats!</i>
(Brittany whoops)

24
00:01:37,085 --> 00:01:38,919
Yeah, you did.

25
00:01:39,003 --> 00:01:40,804
You might want to check the
dates on those tickets, Rachel,

26
00:01:40,871 --> 00:01:42,706
because <i>Cats</i> closed
about 11 years ago.

27
00:01:44,092 --> 00:01:45,275
He did seem crazy.

28
00:01:45,343 --> 00:01:46,677
Charged my credit card

29
00:01:46,728 --> 00:01:48,061
by swiping it through
his butt-crack.

30
00:01:48,146 --> 00:01:49,846
Okay, welcome

31
00:01:49,898 --> 00:01:51,348
to Intercontinental
New York Times Square.

32
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:53,100
- Your rooms are on the seventh floor.
- Great.

33
00:01:53,184 --> 00:01:55,485
You planning on fitting all
those kids in two rooms?

34
00:01:55,553 --> 00:01:57,070
Yeah, well,
it's all we can afford.

35
00:01:57,138 --> 00:01:58,322
I was just thinking about splitting

36
00:01:58,389 --> 00:01:59,131
them up, boys and girls.

37
00:01:59,132 --> 00:02:00,554
You guys in for the show
choir competition?

38
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:01,779
Yeah. Why?

39
00:02:02,076 --> 00:02:04,695
Most of the other teams
split by sexual orientation.

40
00:02:04,746 --> 00:02:07,197
Oh. Did you know that
New York City was built

41
00:02:07,248 --> 00:02:09,166
right on top of
Old York City?

42
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:10,701
I'm pretty sure
that's not true.

43
00:02:10,752 --> 00:02:12,920
Oh, I'm
just pretty.

44
00:02:13,004 --> 00:02:14,421
Hi.
Hi.

45
00:02:14,505 --> 00:02:16,740
I'm surprised at how well
Quinn is taking the breakup.

46
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,242
I guess I was wrong about her
being a vindictive harpy.

47
00:02:19,294 --> 00:02:20,928
I guess she just accepted
the inevitable.

48
00:02:21,012 --> 00:02:22,262
Or maybe she's
just distracted

49
00:02:22,347 --> 00:02:24,247
by the awesomeness of
New York. I know I am.

50
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:27,100
Hey, do you know why it smells
like it's wet here all the time?

51
00:02:27,185 --> 00:02:29,052
No. So, what's going on
with you and Jessie?

52
00:02:29,103 --> 00:02:30,520
I don't know. He
keeps texting me.

53
00:02:30,588 --> 00:02:33,223
But I told him I don't want
to talk till I get back.

54
00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:35,425
No boys, no distractions
until we win that trophy.

55
00:02:35,476 --> 00:02:37,110
Hey, Finn, where the
hell is Puckerman?

56
00:02:37,195 --> 00:02:39,095
Um...

57
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,266
I'll have a Manhattan.

58
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:45,319
Do you even know
what's <i>in</i> a Manhattan?

59
00:02:45,403 --> 00:02:47,237
Yeah, me,
for the first time.

60
00:02:47,288 --> 00:02:49,539
Which is why I want
to celebrate with a cocktail.

61
00:02:49,607 --> 00:02:51,124
(laughs)

62
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:53,610
Guys, group meeting,
in the room now.

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,768
Do you know that I can get
ahi tartare and a steak

64
00:03:01,836 --> 00:03:03,403
sandwich at 3:00
in the morning

65
00:03:03,471 --> 00:03:04,638
from their all-night
dining menu?

66
00:03:04,722 --> 00:03:06,590
I feel like Eloise.
I have pills for that.

67
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:08,458
All right, guys,
this is your time.

68
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:10,644
Now, you are all on lockdown

69
00:03:10,728 --> 00:03:12,596
till you finish writing
our songs for Nationals.

70
00:03:12,647 --> 00:03:14,964
I want at least two solid verses
by the time I get back.

71
00:03:15,016 --> 00:03:16,149
Aren't you going to help us?

72
00:03:16,234 --> 00:03:18,301
Uh, um... I will be back

73
00:03:18,353 --> 00:03:21,021
and read your amazing creations
and give notes, but right now,

74
00:03:21,105 --> 00:03:24,491
I have to head to the theater
to, uh, fill out some paperwork.

We got to get out of here.

98
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,522
Wait. No, no, no. Mr. Shue gave
us explicit instructions...

99
00:04:45,573 --> 00:04:47,557
To write a song,
and our problem is,

100
00:04:47,608 --> 00:04:50,444
is that our only inspiration are
mattresses and bathroom cups.

101
00:04:50,528 --> 00:04:52,696
Quinn's right. We're in the
artists capital of the world.

102
00:04:52,747 --> 00:04:54,898
Poets, musicians,
actors, playwrights.

103
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:57,400
Every dreamer that's ever lived
has passed through this city.

104
00:04:57,452 --> 00:04:59,169
And if we want our dreams
to come true, we need to be

105
00:04:59,236 --> 00:05:00,837
out there with them,
not stuck in here.

Guys, I don't think
this is a good idea.

107
00:05:02,373 --> 00:05:03,924
I mean, we still got
those songs to write.

108
00:05:04,008 --> 00:05:05,509
If we don't write them,
we're going to lose.

109
00:05:05,576 --> 00:05:07,010
No. They're right.

110
00:05:07,077 --> 00:05:09,245
Can't you hear the city
calling to you?

111
00:05:09,297 --> 00:05:11,965
We don't need to write songs
for Nationals.

of our songs

172
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:49,440

with me and Rachel.

173
00:07:49,508 --> 00:07:51,125
I just want to win.
We all know that

174
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,594
you two doing a duet is
our best shot at that.

175
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:55,129
Awesome.

176
00:07:55,214 --> 00:07:58,049
Okay, can we just talk about
the Jewish elephant in the room?

177
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,634
Ask her out, dude.

178
00:07:59,718 --> 00:08:02,753
Who? Rachel? But she's totally
into Jessie right now.

the city of love.

180

we're both captains and all,

224
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,285
we should write a duet
for Nationals.

00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,586
How?

346
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:34,926
Sing.

347
00:16:34,977 --> 00:16:39,580
Picture yourself standing
in front of a full audience,

348
00:16:39,648 --> 00:16:41,899
belting out the final song

349
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,802
of one of the greatest
musicals of all time.

350
00:16:44,853 --> 00:16:46,904
There's no orchestra.

351
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:49,273
Make one.

352
00:16:49,325 --> 00:16:51,409
In your mind.

353
00:16:57,315 --> 00:16:59,117

Thank you, Kurt.

406
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,138
I see it now.

407
00:20:07,189 --> 00:20:10,007
I don't have to choose
between... (sighs)

408
00:20:10,058 --> 00:20:12,860
my career and... love,

409
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,012
because this...

410
00:20:15,063 --> 00:20:18,900
I mean... this stage,
Broadway, New York...

411
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,070
...that's my true love.

412
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,521
(groans)

413
00:20:24,573 --> 00:20:26,523
Quinn! Quit hogging
the bathroom.

414
00:20:26,575 --> 00:20:29,210
I needs to re-pencil
my eyebrows on.

415
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:30,578
Doesn't she get...

416
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:32,496
It's all yours.

417
00:20:32,548 --> 00:20:34,749
Everybody's already
in the other room working.
Oh, yeah?

418
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,217
Is Mr. Shue in there?

419
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:37,868
'Cause I think
I'm gonna tell him

420
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,870
that Rachel and Kurt
keep sneaking off.

421
00:20:39,922 --> 00:20:42,089
You can't do that--
he'll have to suspend them.
And then there goes

422
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,175
our chances at Nationals. Darn!

423
00:20:44,226 --> 00:20:45,760
You know what?
We get it.

424
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,878
You're pissed about Finn
dumping your sweet ass.

425
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:48,980
Get over it.

426
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,681
I don't want to get
over it! Okay?

427
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:52,900
The only person that you're
sabotaging here is yourself.

428
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:56,437
I don't care about some
stupid show choir competition!

429
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:58,356
Well, you should!
Because this is

430
00:20:58,407 --> 00:21:01,359
the one chance that we have to
actually feel good about ourselves.

431
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:04,695
Aren't we supposed to be
the popular girls?

432
00:21:06,748 --> 00:21:09,233
So why can't we have
<i>our</i> dreams come true?

433
00:21:09,284 --> 00:21:11,252
She has love, Tina has it,

434
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,337
even Zizes hooks up.

435
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,291
(exhales)

436
00:21:28,753 --> 00:21:31,138
I just want somebody
to love me. (sniffles)

437
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,641
I think I know how
to make you feel better.

438
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:36,777
I'm flattered, Santana, but
I'm really not that into that.

439
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,195
(sniffles)
No.

440
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:40,481
No, I'm not talking about that.

441
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,266
I'm talking about a haircut.

442
00:21:42,317 --> 00:21:43,618
Yes, totally.

443
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:46,437
WILL:
<i>I'm sorry about the pillows.</i>

444
00:21:46,488 --> 00:21:48,956
I mean, this really was
a... a wake-up call for me

445
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,607
as an educator <i>and</i>
a chaperone, so...

446
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:52,293
Look, I get it.

447
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:54,078
Kids are kids.

448
00:21:54,129 --> 00:21:55,963
Good luck at Nationals.
Thank you.

449
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,164
GOOLSBY:
I'll second that.

450
00:21:59,001 --> 00:22:02,420
And why would you be wishing
my glee club luck at Nationals?

451
00:22:02,471 --> 00:22:03,654
Oh, I wasn't talking
about the glee club.

452
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:06,090
I was wishing you luck
in your Broadway debut.

453
00:22:10,628 --> 00:22:12,296
How did you find out?

454
00:22:12,347 --> 00:22:15,683
It's all over
the Broadway blogosphere.

455
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,068
And by Broadway blogosphere,

456
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:18,903
I mean the one blog that
actually cares about Broadway.

457
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,271
Can I give you
a piece of advice?

458
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,772
Don't tell your kids.

459
00:22:21,823 --> 00:22:23,524
It'll just shake
their confidence at Nationals

460
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,692
and they won't perform as well.

461
00:22:27,162 --> 00:22:28,546
I hate my kids.

462
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:31,582
I would literally
whip them if I could.

463
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:36,153
Every time I see them
achieving...

464
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:39,256
just reminds me of everything
I missed out on.

465
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:41,242
I love my kids.

466
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,810
What? No, you don't.

467
00:22:42,878 --> 00:22:45,129
They're hideous.

468
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,630
My kids are at least attractive.

469
00:22:46,682 --> 00:22:47,832
Yours look like they haven't
been baked properly.

470
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:49,367
(laughs softly)

471
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:53,954
I've watched them grow
into mature young men and women.

472
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:02,847
And that's been the joy
of my life.

473
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:04,899
You're tearing up.
People are starting to stare.

474
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,901
I bet they think
I just broke up with you.

475
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,685
See you on the ice,
Schuester.

476
00:23:11,073 --> 00:23:13,023
(groans)

477
00:23:13,075 --> 00:23:15,209
All right, guys,
who's up for some real

478
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:16,544
New York City... pizza?

479
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,212
We heard.

480
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:19,530
Heard what?

481
00:23:19,581 --> 00:23:20,748
About you leaving
to be on Broadway.

482
00:23:22,884 --> 00:23:24,752
(sighs)

483
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:29,873
Look, I haven't made up my mind
about anything.

484
00:23:29,925 --> 00:23:30,874
We get it.

485
00:23:30,926 --> 00:23:32,443
And we're happy for you.

486
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:35,262
You've inspired us in
so many ways, so...

487
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:36,931
this is just another.

488
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,383
I don't understand.

489
00:23:39,434 --> 00:23:40,601
Who-who told you guys?

490
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:41,652
Goolsby.

491
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:45,673
You okay, Mr. Shue?

492
00:23:45,741 --> 00:23:47,775
I'm not going.

493
00:23:49,444 --> 00:23:51,328
I'm staying with you guys.

494
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:54,415
I had my moment on the stage
and it was glorious.

495
00:23:55,484 --> 00:23:57,284
But you and I...

496
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:59,754
have some unfinished business
to take care of.

497
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:03,407
Now get out your notebooks.

498
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:05,242
Time to get to work.

499
00:24:05,293 --> 00:24:08,179
Come on,
this is Nationals, people.

500
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:11,515
(Will laughs, others "oohing")

501
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,717
Yes, Puck.
I want in, I want in.

502
00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:15,136
Oh, gee!

503
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,687
(laughing)

504
00:24:23,283 --> 00:24:24,363
RACHEL:
We made it.

505
00:24:24,364 --> 00:24:26,732
We're one of the top 50
show choirs in the nation.

506
00:24:26,783 --> 00:24:28,433
Tomorrow only ten will move on
to Showcase,

507
00:24:28,485 --> 00:24:30,452
where they'll vie
for the National Championship.

508
00:24:30,537 --> 00:24:32,104
We have so got this.

509
00:24:32,155 --> 00:24:33,739
Okay, usually
I'm pretty cautious

510
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:36,041
about getting your hopes up,
but honestly, guys?

511
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:38,911
I think we got a really good
shot at winning this thing.

512
00:24:38,962 --> 00:24:41,630
All right, everybody put
your hand in the middle.

513
00:24:41,715 --> 00:24:43,132
One, two, three.

I do this thing
where I get my kids to sign

542
00:25:40,974 --> 00:25:43,609
a T-shirt to send to all
the teams we beat at Nationals.

543
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:45,194
Yeah, well,
don't bother getting us one.

544
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:47,846
I have a sneaking suspicion that
we're about to kick your ass.

545
00:25:47,897 --> 00:25:50,282
You're about to go up against
the top show choirs

546
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:52,317
in the country
and your team spent all week

547
00:25:52,369 --> 00:25:55,704
mooning about how fun
and exciting New York is.

548
00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:56,872
You're a bag of meat.

549
00:25:56,956 --> 00:25:58,991
Take a large.
You're about a large, right?

550
00:25:59,042 --> 00:25:59,992
Extra large.
What are you doing?

551
00:26:00,043 --> 00:26:02,461
Buying you a T-shirt, Goolsby.

552
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:04,263
I'll send it to you...

553
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,881

(toilet flushing)

558
00:26:16,593 --> 00:26:18,543
Oh, shoving your fingers
down your throat

559
00:26:18,595 --> 00:26:20,545
like the rest
of your brainwashed

560
00:26:20,597 --> 00:26:22,398
Vocal Adrenaline
brothers and sisters?

561
00:26:22,482 --> 00:26:24,767
I'm not throwing up
on purpose.

562
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:28,320
I'm so nervous
I can't keep any food down.

563
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:30,389
I used to love singing.

564
00:26:30,457 --> 00:26:32,024
It was the only thing
that relaxed me.

565
00:26:32,075 --> 00:26:33,158
Now I hate it.

566
00:26:33,226 --> 00:26:36,245
Do you think I'm an idiot?
No.

567
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:38,280
I think you're kind of mean,
but I don't think you're stupid.

568
00:26:38,364 --> 00:26:39,581
I know what you're
trying to doing.

569
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,116
You're trying to get me
to feel bad for you

570
00:26:41,201 --> 00:26:42,835
so that I don't try as hard
to crush you on the stage.

571
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:44,953
What did I ever do to you
to make you hate me so much?

572
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:48,123
When I came to your school,
I heard that the Glee Club

573
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:49,591
was where kids went when no one
else would take them.

574
00:26:49,676 --> 00:26:51,210
A safe place.

575
00:26:51,261 --> 00:26:54,763
For some reason, you made me the
only one who wasn't safe there.

576
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,414
Where are you going?

577
00:26:56,466 --> 00:26:59,017
To the Philippine embassy.

578
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:01,804
I'm going to beg them to revoke
my visa and deport me back home.

579
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:03,689
That's the only way

580
00:27:03,756 --> 00:27:05,441
I'm going to be able
to escape Vocal Adrenaline.

581
00:27:05,525 --> 00:27:07,142
Wait... wait.

582
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:11,230
It's because you're good.

583
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:13,765
That's why I hated you.

584
00:27:13,817 --> 00:27:16,735
That's why I sent you
to that crack house.

585
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:20,155
I'm sorry.

586
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:24,493
But you have to go out there
and sing.

587
00:27:26,129 --> 00:27:27,379
You have a gift.

588
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:30,816
Something that Dustin
Goolsby would kill for.

589
00:27:30,884 --> 00:27:33,385
I can't. I'm going to barf
all over the stage.

590
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:34,488
If you feel like you're going
to throw up

591
00:27:34,513 --> 00:27:36,012
just look at me, 
and I'll help you through it.

592
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:37,923
Why?

593
00:27:37,974 --> 00:27:39,291
Don't you want to win?

594
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,744
Guys like us
have to stick together.

595
00:27:42,812 --> 00:27:45,564
I'm going to hug you now.

You wrote an amazing song, Finn.

I didn't know you had it in you.

Who cares about the song?

I love you.

657
00:31:20,869 --> 00:31:22,403
But...

658
00:31:22,488 --> 00:31:24,655
(sighs) ...there's nothing
you can say or do

659
00:31:24,723 --> 00:31:26,441
that's gonna
change my mind about it.

Don't you think this is gonna
look so hot on Lord Tubbington?

764
00:36:42,657 --> 00:36:44,859
I'm gonna go find it
in an extra large.

765
00:36:44,943 --> 00:36:47,478
(throat clearing)

766
00:36:47,529 --> 00:36:49,497
I think we were good.

767
00:36:49,581 --> 00:36:51,982
Good? We were amazing.

768
00:36:52,034 --> 00:36:55,202
The kiss was... interesting.

769
00:36:55,287 --> 00:36:57,254
Yeah, I'm-I'm calling it
The Kiss of the Century.

770
00:36:57,322 --> 00:36:58,456
JESSIE:
You're wrong, Finn.

771
00:36:58,507 --> 00:36:59,673
That kiss was unprofessional.

772
00:36:59,758 --> 00:37:01,325
It was too personal and intense.

773
00:37:01,376 --> 00:37:03,177
The judges won't like it.
They'll consider it common

774
00:37:03,261 --> 00:37:05,746
and vulgar, and it cost you
Nationals. Hi, Rachel.

775
00:37:05,814 --> 00:37:07,965
You look amazing,
and you sounded great.

776
00:37:08,016 --> 00:37:09,383
Just shouldn't have kissed him.

777
00:37:09,468 --> 00:37:10,684
Why are you
here, Jessie?

778
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:11,502
For you.

779
00:37:11,553 --> 00:37:13,687
Dude, back off.

780
00:37:13,772 --> 00:37:15,672
You're just jealous.
(scoffs)

781
00:37:15,724 --> 00:37:17,007
Jealous of what we have,

782
00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:18,559
and what we shared
with the entire audience,

783
00:37:18,643 --> 00:37:21,445
because it was shared between
two people who love each other.

784
00:37:21,513 --> 00:37:23,697
It was the Superman of kisses.

785
00:37:23,782 --> 00:37:26,317
It-It came with its own cape,
right, Rachel?

786
00:37:26,368 --> 00:37:28,852
(high-pitched shrieking
and excited chatter)

787
00:37:28,904 --> 00:37:29,570
What's-What's
happening?

788
00:37:31,656 --> 00:37:33,524
They just posted
the top ten for showcase.

789
00:37:33,575 --> 00:37:35,242
Everybody, gather around!
It's a moment

790
00:37:35,327 --> 00:37:36,994
two years in the making.
Okay, what should we do?

791
00:37:37,045 --> 00:37:38,546
Let's go look at it...
together.

792
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,131
Come on, come on.

793
00:37:40,198 --> 00:37:42,249
Come on, come on.

794
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:57,064
RACHEL:
Oh, I'm too nervous to look.

795
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:58,682
I'll go.

796
00:38:00,652 --> 00:38:02,820
What did we place?

797
00:38:12,414 --> 00:38:13,447
Well, Mr. Shue?

798
00:38:14,666 --> 00:38:17,084
Say it. What did we rank?

799
00:38:18,286 --> 00:38:20,254
We didn't.

800
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,295
I'm so sorry, you guys.

801
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,764
We aren't in the top ten.

802
00:38:39,332 --> 00:38:41,332
Oh my God,
you should have seen it.

803
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:43,609
We all looked at the top
ten list for Showcase,

804
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,027
and we all just
went numb.

805
00:38:45,112 --> 00:38:47,113
And then Jessie kept
going on and on

806
00:38:47,164 --> 00:38:48,931
about how Rachel and Finn's
kiss is what cost us Nationals.

807
00:38:48,999 --> 00:38:50,983
While I understand
passion, I do think

808
00:38:51,034 --> 00:38:52,835
that was unprofessional,
but sorry. Keep going.

809
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,756
Okay, then we get back to
the hotel, and Santana loses it.

810
00:39:05,182 --> 00:39:07,350
I mean, and the plane ride
was completely silent.

811
00:39:07,434 --> 00:39:08,968
Like, no one said a word.

812
00:39:09,036 --> 00:39:11,270
We all just sat there
with our faces buried

813
00:39:11,338 --> 00:39:12,722
in our complimentary copies
of <i>SkyMall.</i>

814
00:39:12,806 --> 00:39:15,308
Wait, I don't get it.
You don't seem that sad at all.

815
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,144
Well, it was still amazing.

816
00:39:18,195 --> 00:39:21,781
I mean, I flew on a plane
for the first time in my life,

817
00:39:21,848 --> 00:39:23,149
I had breakfast at Tiffany's,

818
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,902
I sang on a Broadway stage.

819
00:39:25,986 --> 00:39:28,854
I love you.

820
00:39:34,695 --> 00:39:36,528
I love you, too.

821
00:39:40,133 --> 00:39:42,468
You know, when you stop
and think about it,

822
00:39:42,535 --> 00:39:45,087
Kurt Hummel's had
a pretty good year.

823
00:39:45,172 --> 00:39:47,840
Oh, look who's here.

824
00:39:47,891 --> 00:39:49,392
Hey, what are you guys
doing here?

825
00:39:49,476 --> 00:39:52,511
Uh, nothing.
Just, uh, getting a coffee.

826
00:39:52,563 --> 00:39:54,480
We ran into each other
in the parking lot.

827
00:39:54,547 --> 00:39:55,982
We're on our way
to get some sheet music.

828
00:39:56,049 --> 00:39:57,716
Tomorrow's my audition for
the summer show at Six Flags.

829
00:39:57,768 --> 00:40:01,654
Whereas I'm spending my summer
composing <i>Pip, Pip, Hooray!</i>

830
00:40:01,721 --> 00:40:03,189
The Broadway music
about Pippa Middleton.

831
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,908
I have no idea who that is,
but it sounds totally awesome.

832
00:40:05,993 --> 00:40:06,993
(laughs)

833
00:40:08,662 --> 00:40:10,863
We'll see you in class.

834
00:40:10,914 --> 00:40:12,564
Bye.
Bye, guys.

835
00:40:12,616 --> 00:40:15,167
Okay, so here are the nominees
for my songs tomorrow.

836
00:40:15,235 --> 00:40:16,419
I think I could
probably...

837
00:40:16,503 --> 00:40:17,954
Do you think
they know?

838
00:40:18,038 --> 00:40:19,755
I don't think
anybody knows.

839
00:40:25,429 --> 00:40:26,929
(school bell ringing)
BRITTANY: Hey.

840
00:40:27,014 --> 00:40:28,598
You still pissed?

841
00:40:28,682 --> 00:40:30,082
Do you think this
voodoo doll looks enough

842
00:40:30,133 --> 00:40:31,250
like Rachel Berry
to actually work?

843
00:40:31,318 --> 00:40:33,252
Come on. We can't be mad
at Rachel forever.

844
00:40:33,303 --> 00:40:35,471
Uh, yes, we can.

845
00:40:35,555 --> 00:40:37,607
How could you
possibly be so calm?

846
00:40:37,691 --> 00:40:40,476
I don't know. I hated losing
just as much as everyone,

847
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,862
but this year wasn't
about winning for me.

848
00:40:42,929 --> 00:40:45,231
Clearly, 'cause we
got our asses kicked.

849
00:40:45,299 --> 00:40:47,149
Yeah.

850
00:40:47,234 --> 00:40:49,151
Sorry.

851
00:40:49,236 --> 00:40:51,120
What was it about?

852
00:40:51,204 --> 00:40:53,956
Acceptance.

853
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:57,994
I know that all the kids
in the glee club-- they fight,

854
00:40:58,078 --> 00:41:00,663
and they steal each other's
boyfriends and girlfriends,

855
00:41:00,747 --> 00:41:04,066
and they threaten to quit,
like, every other week,

856
00:41:04,134 --> 00:41:06,335
but weird stuff like that
happens in families.

857
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,754
Yeah, well, this is a club.
This is not a family.

858
00:41:08,805 --> 00:41:11,007
Okay, well, family is a place

859
00:41:11,091 --> 00:41:13,125
where everyone loves you
no matter what,

860
00:41:13,176 --> 00:41:14,927
and they accept you
for who you are.

861
00:41:14,978 --> 00:41:17,063
I know I'm going to be
a bridesmaid at Mike

862
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,397
and Tina's wedding,
and I'm gonna be

863
00:41:18,465 --> 00:41:19,565
anxiously awaiting,
just like everyone else,

864
00:41:19,632 --> 00:41:21,334
to see if their babies
are Asian, too.

865
00:41:21,401 --> 00:41:23,469
When they find an operation
to make Artie's legs work again,

866
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,105
I'm going to be there
for his first steps.

867
00:41:26,156 --> 00:41:29,025
I love them.
I love everyone in Glee Club.

868
00:41:29,109 --> 00:41:30,809
And I get to spend another year

869
00:41:30,861 --> 00:41:32,478
with everyone I love,
so, I'm good.

870
00:41:32,546 --> 00:41:34,413
What about you and I?

871
00:41:34,481 --> 00:41:36,365
I love you, Santana.

872
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:37,783
I love you more

873
00:41:37,834 --> 00:41:40,136
than I've ever loved anyone else
in this world.

874
00:41:40,203 --> 00:41:43,372
All I know about you and I
is that, because of that,

875
00:41:43,457 --> 00:41:45,324
I think anything's possible.

876
00:41:46,493 --> 00:41:48,660
(sighs)

877
00:41:49,846 --> 00:41:51,964
You're my best friend.

878
00:41:52,015 --> 00:41:53,516
Yeah, me, too.

879
00:41:58,671 --> 00:42:00,606
(laughs)

880
00:42:02,008 --> 00:42:03,976
When did you
get so smart?

881
00:42:04,027 --> 00:42:05,945
(school bell ringing)

882
00:42:08,532 --> 00:42:10,849
(sighs)

883
00:42:10,901 --> 00:42:12,785
Where have you been?

884
00:42:12,852 --> 00:42:14,070
Hiding out.

885
00:42:14,154 --> 00:42:15,621
Everyone hates me.

886
00:42:15,689 --> 00:42:17,673
No, they don't.
It doesn't explain why

887
00:42:17,741 --> 00:42:20,543
you haven't said a word to me
since we've been back.

888
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:23,129
'Cause you should be more pissed
at me than anyone else.

889
00:42:23,196 --> 00:42:24,580
I screwed up!

890
00:42:24,664 --> 00:42:26,816
I'm humiliated.
We worked so hard

891
00:42:26,883 --> 00:42:28,217
for everything,

892
00:42:28,285 --> 00:42:30,753
and I was supposed
to be this big shot leader,

893
00:42:30,837 --> 00:42:34,690
holding everyone together,
and... I blew it.

894
00:42:34,758 --> 00:42:36,976
Cost us the
championship.

895
00:42:37,043 --> 00:42:39,228
Look, being an artist

896
00:42:39,312 --> 00:42:41,213
is about expressing
your true feelings,

897
00:42:41,264 --> 00:42:44,049
in the moment,
no matter what the consequences.

898
00:42:44,101 --> 00:42:46,118
What were you feeling
in that moment?

899
00:42:46,186 --> 00:42:48,003
That I loved you.

900
00:42:50,424 --> 00:42:52,925
And that I would have
done or given anything

901
00:42:52,993 --> 00:42:54,860
to kiss you
one more time.

902
00:42:54,911 --> 00:42:57,062
So you did.

903
00:42:58,915 --> 00:43:02,284
You know, you gave it all up
for one kiss.

904
00:43:02,369 --> 00:43:04,787
Yeah.

905
00:43:04,855 --> 00:43:06,756
Was it worth it?

906
00:43:07,958 --> 00:43:09,859
Yeah.

907
00:43:09,926 --> 00:43:11,794
What about you?

908
00:43:13,547 --> 00:43:15,948
Was it worth it for you?

909
00:43:17,134 --> 00:43:18,868
Yeah.

910
00:43:18,935 --> 00:43:20,752
(sighs)

911
00:43:20,804 --> 00:43:22,388
'Cause I know in my heart

912
00:43:22,439 --> 00:43:23,956
we'll have another shot
at Nationals.

913
00:43:24,024 --> 00:43:28,043
You have to know that I...
I'm leaving, Finn.

914
00:43:28,111 --> 00:43:30,780
I'm going to New York,
and I'm never coming back.

915
00:43:31,982 --> 00:43:34,483
Graduation's a year away.

916
00:43:34,568 --> 00:43:36,935
You got any
plans till then?

917
00:43:46,913 --> 00:43:48,831
Okay. Let's go.

918
00:43:48,915 --> 00:43:50,916
Where are we going?

919
00:43:50,967 --> 00:43:52,751
Final Glee Club meeting
of the year.

920
00:43:55,788 --> 00:43:57,473
No other show choir

921
00:43:57,557 --> 00:44:00,226
who finished in 12th place
has ever felt so honored.

922
00:44:00,293 --> 00:44:02,394
(school bell ringing)

923
00:44:04,147 --> 00:44:06,965
(indistinct chatter)

924
00:44:07,017 --> 00:44:08,634
Hi.
Hi.

925
00:44:08,685 --> 00:44:10,402
Hi.
Hiya. Come on.

926
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:12,905
You guys want to see
what 12th place looks like?

927
00:44:12,972 --> 00:44:16,972
