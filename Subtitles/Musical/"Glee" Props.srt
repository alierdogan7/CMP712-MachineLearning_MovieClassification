1
00:00:00,358 --> 00:00:01,568
<i>So here's what's you missed
<i>Kurt pulled</i>

2
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:03,779
<i>a last-minute switcheroo
for Carmen Tibideaux</i>

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,665
<i>and nailed his NYADA audition,
while Rachel</i>

4
00:00:05,666 --> 00:00:07,216
<i>tried her old "Don't Rain
on My Parade" standby</i>

5
00:00:07,217 --> 00:00:08,117
<i>which we've all heard now,
like, a bajillion times,</i>

6
00:00:08,202 --> 00:00:09,669
<i>and she totally choked.</i>

7
00:00:09,736 --> 00:00:11,370
<i>Bieste admitted that
her husband Cooter hit her,</i>

8
00:00:11,371 --> 00:00:13,764
<i>but she lied and said she left
him, when actually, she stayed.</i>

9
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,075
<i>Puck isn't graduating, which he
pretends not to care about...</i>

10
00:00:16,076 --> 00:00:17,434
I'm too stupid. <i>but a while
back, he told everybody</i>

11
00:00:17,511 --> 00:00:18,744
<i>that graduating high school
was something</i>

12
00:00:18,745 --> 00:00:20,246
<i>he was really
looking forward to.</i>

13
00:00:20,247 --> 00:00:22,265
<i>The Glee Club's been ignoring
Tina all year long.</i>

14
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:23,916
Tina won't mind being recast.
No, she won't.

15
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:25,817
<i>Actually, she kind of got
ignored last year, too.</i>

16
00:00:25,852 --> 00:00:27,053
<i>Actually, Tina's sort of been
ignored the whole time</i>

17
00:00:27,054 --> 00:00:28,304
<i>and she's been
in the New Directions!</i>

18
00:00:28,305 --> 00:00:30,389
<i>since, like forever.</i>

19
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,924
<i>The first time she got a solo,
she insisted she was bad</i>

20
00:00:31,925 --> 00:00:33,425
<i>and forced Mr. Shue
to give the song to Rachel,</i>

21
00:00:33,426 --> 00:00:34,810
<i>and ever solo since, she's
either gotten booed</i>

22
00:00:34,811 --> 00:00:36,312
<i>or started crying
uncontrollably.</i>

23
00:00:36,313 --> 00:00:37,863
<i>No one noticed that she went
from dressing punk</i>

24
00:00:37,864 --> 00:00:39,315
<i>to dressing Goth to dressing
like a go-go dancer</i>

25
00:00:39,316 --> 00:00:40,582
<i>in '60s Swinging London.</i>

26
00:00:40,617 --> 00:00:41,541
<i>She even got Mike Chang
into college,</i>

27
00:00:41,568 --> 00:00:43,069
<i>and she hardly got a thank you.</i>

28
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,287
<i>Sometimes people don't even
seem to know her name.</i>

29
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,705
Girl Chang...
Tina Blowin' Wang...

30
00:00:45,706 --> 00:00:47,206
Asian Horror Movie!

31
00:00:47,207 --> 00:00:49,207
<i>And that's what
you missed on</i> Glee.

32
00:00:50,894 --> 00:00:54,546
Porcelain, Weezy,
you created a monster.

33
00:00:56,767 --> 00:01:00,268
They're calling Jessie
St. James a visionary,

34
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,221
and lauding Vocal Adrenaline

35
00:01:02,222 --> 00:01:04,323
for their ongoing
commitment to diversity.

36
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:06,659
But Jessie St. James was against
Unique performing

37
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,077
as his true magical self.

38
00:01:08,078 --> 00:01:10,246
No, we were the ones who
convinced him to do that.

39
00:01:10,247 --> 00:01:11,446
Well, then, you only have
yourselves to blame.

40
00:01:11,448 --> 00:01:13,616
And the liberal media.

41
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,866
Not really.
It was your idea.

42
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:15,993
I have no memory of that.

43
00:01:16,036 --> 00:01:17,536
In any case, Unique is now

44
00:01:17,537 --> 00:01:19,922
a show choir celebrity.

45
00:01:20,006 --> 00:01:22,124
He/She will trounce us
at Nationals,

46
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:24,418
and I will lose my Cheerios!
to Coach Roz Washington.

47
00:01:24,428 --> 00:01:26,178
I will not let that happen.

48
00:01:26,179 --> 00:01:28,914
We have but
one choice left to us:

49
00:01:28,915 --> 00:01:31,425
It's time to fight fire

50
00:01:31,468 --> 00:01:36,255
with the flaming flames
of additional flamey gay fire.

51
00:01:38,692 --> 00:01:40,976
Porcelain, you will
wear this flapper dress

52
00:01:40,977 --> 00:01:43,446
and perform at Nationals
as Porcelina.

53
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,764
You already have the lady
gait and the lady voice,

54
00:01:45,816 --> 00:01:48,234
and you'll have to start
smoking, though,

55
00:01:48,235 --> 00:01:49,435
because this dress
is a size two.

56
00:01:49,486 --> 00:01:50,569
Okay, just because I'm gay
does not mean

57
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,070
I like to dress up like a woman.

58
00:01:52,072 --> 00:01:53,038
Oh, come on.

59
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,440
What about Halloween, Kurt?

60
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:58,035
Trick or treat!
Ba-da bing!

61
00:01:58,044 --> 00:01:59,611
Ay, what's a guy gotta do

62
00:01:59,612 --> 00:02:02,248
to get a candy situation
up in here, huh?

63
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:04,333
Okay, that was a
Halloween costume,

64
00:02:04,334 --> 00:02:07,002
and it is a far cry from starting out
on the stage at Nationals in a dress.

65
00:02:07,053 --> 00:02:08,795
Which is absolutely
out of the question.

66
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:10,589
Well, then, the
New Directions! will lose.

67
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,391
Hate to say it, kiddo,

68
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:15,845
but if we want to beat Vocal
Adrenaline at Nationals,

69
00:02:15,846 --> 00:02:17,262
it's tuckin' time.

You've reaed the
office of Carmen Tibideaux,

112
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:14,573
Dean of Vocal Performance,
at the New York Academy

113
00:05:14,574 --> 00:05:15,658
of Dramatic Arts.

114
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:17,493
Please leave a message
after the tone.

115
00:05:18,995 --> 00:05:21,380
Hi, Madame Tibideaux, this is
Rachel Berry calling.

116
00:05:21,448 --> 00:05:24,450
I understand that
14 messages is a lot,

117
00:05:24,451 --> 00:05:25,868
but I just wanted to make sure

118
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:27,503
that you got the muffin basket
that I sent

119
00:05:27,504 --> 00:05:30,506
as well as the invitation to
come and see my show choir

120
00:05:30,507 --> 00:05:32,207
perform at our Nationals
in Chicago.

121
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:36,128
Every year, the judges give out
an award for an MVP,

122
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:37,346
and I would really love it

123
00:05:37,347 --> 00:05:38,681
if you could be there
to watch me win.

124
00:05:38,682 --> 00:05:41,266
If anything, just to show you

125
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:43,018
that what happened at
my audition was a fluke

126
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:45,504
and that I do have the talent
and the ability

127
00:05:45,505 --> 00:05:47,172
to study with you
next year at NYADA.

128
00:05:47,173 --> 00:05:50,693
I... I understand that asking
you to make the trip is a lot,

129
00:05:50,694 --> 00:05:52,394
but I'm just...
I'm really not ready

130
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:54,146
to give up on my dream, so...

131
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:56,649
Thank you very much.

132
00:06:04,324 --> 00:06:05,991
Nationals.

133
00:06:08,378 --> 00:06:09,628
Okay, song selection:

134
00:06:09,696 --> 00:06:11,863
We'll be kicking off our
"Vintage" theme

135
00:06:11,864 --> 00:06:13,048
with the legendary
Jim Steinman's

136
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:15,084
"Paradise by
the Dashboard Light."

137
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:16,459
Rachel will do the solo,
"It's All Com..."

138
00:06:16,503 --> 00:06:18,203
"...Coming Back to Me Now."

139
00:06:18,204 --> 00:06:19,212
One of Celine Dion's most
powerful ballads,

140
00:06:19,222 --> 00:06:20,889
inspired by <i>Wuthering Heights.</i>

141
00:06:20,974 --> 00:06:22,558
And we'll be working in
a new Treble Tones number,

142
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:24,876
utilizing the talents of our
featured performer,

143
00:06:24,877 --> 00:06:26,261
Porcelina Hummel.

144
00:06:26,346 --> 00:06:27,813
Not gonna happen,
Dragon Lady.

145
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,055
Oh, you'll do
as you're told, he/she.

146
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:30,599
We will be performing

147
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,401
"What A Feeling,"
from <i>Flashdance,</i>

148
00:06:32,402 --> 00:06:34,570
and I'm familiar with the
choreography, of course,

149
00:06:34,571 --> 00:06:36,187
because I was Jennifer Beals'
dance double.

150
00:06:36,206 --> 00:06:37,355
And on that note,

151
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,607
please look under your seats.

152
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:44,580
Space helmets.

153
00:06:44,581 --> 00:06:46,915
Welding helmets
and leg warmers?!

154
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,451
Best way to get props
is to use props.

155
00:06:49,502 --> 00:06:50,753
I am your father.

156
00:06:50,754 --> 00:06:52,120
Uh, Darth Vader.

157
00:06:52,122 --> 00:06:53,204
Is that a movie?

158
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:54,790
A healthy dose of props,

159
00:06:54,874 --> 00:06:57,000
and our plucky transsexual
Porcelina,

160
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:58,126
and you are over the top.

161
00:06:58,178 --> 00:07:00,412
Aren't props a little cheesy?

162
00:07:00,413 --> 00:07:03,132
Guys, I've asked for Sue's
help because she's a winner,

163
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:05,634
and I'm not ashamed to admit
this... I want to win.

164
00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:07,686
But there's not one
person in that audience

165
00:07:07,687 --> 00:07:09,555
who will think we're
anything but underdogs

166
00:07:09,606 --> 00:07:11,106
who would be lucky to
place in Nationals.

167
00:07:11,191 --> 00:07:12,758
We didn't even make
the top ten last year.

168
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:16,862
We've got one last week to come
together and shake things up.

169
00:07:16,929 --> 00:07:19,264
If there's anyone here
who is not up for trying

170
00:07:19,265 --> 00:07:20,699
and working their butts off,

171
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,867
you should just get up
right now and leave.

172
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,154
Whoa, whoa, Tina,
where you going?

173
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:26,872
You guys don't need me...
carry on.

174
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:28,448
Tina, you don't understand.
I need this.

175
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,775
Because you blew an audition?

176
00:07:29,776 --> 00:07:31,326
That's not a reason for you

177
00:07:31,377 --> 00:07:32,611
to get a solo at Nationals.

178
00:07:32,662 --> 00:07:33,879
Maybe the rest of us
would like one, too.

179
00:07:33,946 --> 00:07:35,538
I wouldn't mind
another one

180
00:07:35,582 --> 00:07:36,799
before I get deported.

181
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,500
I want one.
Even though I can't sing.

182
00:07:38,551 --> 00:07:39,751
Tina, Rachel is a senior.

183
00:07:39,786 --> 00:07:40,753
So are you, but you can bet

184
00:07:40,754 --> 00:07:41,720
the only thing you'll be doing

185
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:42,879
is a dance break with Brittany.

186
00:07:42,922 --> 00:07:44,289
Other people matter.

187
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,891
Tina, you may not always
get all the solos,

188
00:07:45,892 --> 00:07:46,966
but you are a key player.

189
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,510
I put you in charge
of costumes.

190
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:50,295
Wow! Like that's some prize.

191
00:07:50,363 --> 00:07:51,563
You want props
to move around?

192
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:53,999
Well, I'm a human prop,
and I'm sick of it!

193
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:55,725
Take a lap and cool down,
Asian Number One.

194
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:57,770
My name is Tina.

195
00:07:57,771 --> 00:07:59,137
Tina Cohen Chang!

196
00:08:04,277 --> 00:08:05,577
Isn't she the one
who used to stutter?

197
00:08:05,578 --> 00:08:07,312
You're being selfish.

198
00:08:07,313 --> 00:08:08,313
How come when Rachel complains

199
00:08:08,314 --> 00:08:09,314
about not getting enough solos,

200
00:08:09,315 --> 00:08:10,365
she's "claiming her stardom,"

201
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:11,324
but when I do it,
it's selfish.

202
00:08:11,334 --> 00:08:12,501
You're a junior.

203
00:08:12,502 --> 00:08:13,702
You'll get your
change next year.

204
00:08:13,703 --> 00:08:15,487
This is the seniors'
moment to shine.

205
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:19,007
I'm really
disappointed in you.

206
00:08:19,008 --> 00:08:21,827
Tina, look, I understand
that you feel like

207
00:08:21,878 --> 00:08:23,595
your voice is being stifled
right now, in the Glee Club.

208
00:08:23,663 --> 00:08:24,963
I mean, I have no idea
why you would choose

209
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:26,548
this moment specifically
to make a stink about it

210
00:08:26,633 --> 00:08:29,000
but I want you to know
that you are being heard.

211
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:31,386
Which is why I'm willing
to offer you $50

212
00:08:31,471 --> 00:08:32,855
just to let this all go
until after Nationals.

213
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,441
Do you have any idea how
important Nationals is to me?

214
00:08:36,442 --> 00:08:37,893
I mean, if I can convince
Carmen Tibideaux

215
00:08:37,894 --> 00:08:39,311
to come and
watch us perform,

216
00:08:39,312 --> 00:08:41,513
then it's basically like
a do-over for my NYADA audition,

217
00:08:41,514 --> 00:08:44,349
which means that my entire future
depends on us being amazing,

218
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,034
which means that everyone
needs to do their part.

219
00:08:46,119 --> 00:08:47,861
Their part
to make you look good.

220
00:08:47,904 --> 00:08:51,990
I have sat, for three years,
in the back of that choir room,

221
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,409
holding Mike's hand or
crying or smiling and swaying,

222
00:08:54,494 --> 00:08:57,296
while everyone else was
out there singing solos.

223
00:08:57,363 --> 00:08:59,832
Maybe I say something,
most of the time I don't,

224
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,216
team player all the way.

225
00:09:01,217 --> 00:09:03,919
I am tired of being silent.

226
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:05,838
I am one of the original
Glee Club members,

227
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:07,840
and I was singing "Sit Down
You're Rockin' the Boat"

228
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:09,308
when Finn and Puck were
still throwing Slushees at us.

229
00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:10,726
So when is it my turn?

230
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,846
Do you have any idea how
difficult it is to be me?

231
00:09:13,847 --> 00:09:16,515
Do you have a Facebook
account or Twitter account?

232
00:09:16,516 --> 00:09:17,932
Yes. Do you have
time to watch Bravo

233
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:20,068
or read a book or buy laces

234
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:21,144
for your incredibly
high comical boots.

235
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:23,105
Okay? I don't.

236
00:09:23,106 --> 00:09:24,656
It's exhausting being me.

237
00:09:24,657 --> 00:09:26,057
I get up at 5:00
in the morning

238
00:09:26,058 --> 00:09:27,192
just to get all
of this prepared,

239
00:09:27,193 --> 00:09:28,443
in case a solo
is thrown my way.

240
00:09:28,528 --> 00:09:31,280
I have the entire Sondheim,
Hamlisch, Lloyd-Webber,

241
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:32,664
Elton John songbooks
memorized,

242
00:09:32,732 --> 00:09:34,232
including every single
Katy Perry hit, as well.

243
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:37,035
And I do all of this while
keeping my boyfriend interested

244
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:38,170
and physically satisfied

245
00:09:38,171 --> 00:09:39,755
and being the captain
of 16 clubs

246
00:09:39,756 --> 00:09:41,573
and keeping a 3.86 GPA.

247
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:43,708
I could do all of that.
And you will.

248
00:09:43,743 --> 00:09:45,093
Next year.

249
00:09:45,094 --> 00:09:47,579
You'll have your
chance next year.

250
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,183
All I want is, for one moment,
to feel like you...

251
00:09:51,184 --> 00:09:53,886
be up on that stage and get one
of the standing ovations

252
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:55,137
you're so used to getting.

253
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:05,197
I mean, I'm behind you 100%.

254
00:10:05,264 --> 00:10:06,865
Being gay doesn't mean
you're a cross-dresser.

255
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:08,317
I mean, that's just silly.

256
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:10,769
Oh, you did not just text me
that, Michael Robert Chang.

257
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,537
Is that Tina?

258
00:10:12,538 --> 00:10:13,872
Hey, Tina.
What are you doing here?

259
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,124
Fulfilling my duties
as costume coordinator

260
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,376
and text-fighting with Mike,
who says

261
00:10:17,377 --> 00:10:18,577
my outburst in
Glee Club was unreasonable.

262
00:10:18,578 --> 00:10:19,577
Well, we're getting a hot
pretzel later,

263
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:21,129
if you want to join us.

264
00:10:21,214 --> 00:10:22,714
Can't.
Have to go find gown fabric

265
00:10:22,715 --> 00:10:24,115
that doesn't clash with
the high yellow undertones

266
00:10:24,116 --> 00:10:25,500
of Rachel Berry's complexion.

267
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:26,668
Oh...

268
00:10:30,173 --> 00:10:32,758
I can do everything
Rachel Berry can.

269
00:10:35,962 --> 00:10:37,679
Oh, my God!
Tina! Tina!

270
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,297
Tina! Oh, my God! Oh, oh, oh!
Get her, get her, get her!

271
00:10:39,298 --> 00:10:40,298
Tina, are you okay?

272
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:41,600
Can you hear me?
Look at me.

273
00:10:41,601 --> 00:10:43,643
Oh, my God, this is
like <i>Days of our Lives.</i>

274
00:10:43,653 --> 00:10:44,769
Can you hear me?

275
00:10:44,771 --> 00:10:46,021
Lost...
It's me...

276
00:10:46,105 --> 00:10:47,105
Kurt.
Rachel, it's me.

277
00:10:47,156 --> 00:10:48,690
Did you just
call me Rachel?

278
00:10:50,076 --> 00:10:51,660
Rachel, Kurt and I just saw you

279
00:10:51,661 --> 00:10:52,861
fall into the fountain.

280
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:54,079
We think you may have
hit your head.

281
00:10:54,146 --> 00:10:55,530
We need to get you back
to the Glee Club, ASAP.

282
00:10:55,581 --> 00:10:57,666
Why?

283
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:58,984
And we need to get
your solo ready,

284
00:10:58,985 --> 00:11:00,202
so you can win us
a national championship.

285
00:11:05,591 --> 00:11:08,794
Oh, my God...
I'm Rachel Berry.

286
00:11:10,886 --> 00:11:12,203
Rachel, I know you're
under a lot of pressure,

287
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:13,304
but I need you
to come with me

288
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:14,389
to Between the Sheets
after school.

289
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,540
I'm in desperate need
of sheet music,

290
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:16,808
and you're the only one
who can help me.

291
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,009
If you want to run into your

292
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,210
old pal Chandler,
far be it from me

293
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:20,395
to stand in your way.

294
00:11:20,396 --> 00:11:21,513
We've been through this
a million times.

295
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,647
It was just
a few text messages...

296
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:23,815
Oh, hey there, Hobbit.

297
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:24,899
Can't wait to
hear your solo

298
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,401
in Glee Club today.

299
00:11:26,402 --> 00:11:28,603
Hope you don't choke like
you did in your NYADA audition.

300
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:31,773
Rachel, I don't want to put
any more pressure on you,

301
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,408
but winning at Nationals will
be the most important thing

302
00:11:33,409 --> 00:11:35,076
that will ever happen to me
in my entire life.

303
00:11:35,077 --> 00:11:36,494
I mean, you'll
basically be performing

304
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,563
for every handi-capable kid
in the entire world.

305
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,832
Mercedes?
Mmm, praise.

306
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,667
Rachel, after your
solo, I have to bail

307
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,118
Lord Tubbington
out of jail.

308
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:46,737
He tried to sell my
iPhone for drugs.

309
00:11:46,738 --> 00:11:48,172
Brittany?

310
00:11:48,173 --> 00:11:51,075
Rachel, can I talk
to you for a second?

311
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:54,412
I know that
drama school auditions

312
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:55,713
are a year away for me,

313
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,765
and I know that I'm
kind of a long shot,

314
00:11:57,766 --> 00:11:59,017
but I was
wondering if maybe

315
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,251
you could give me
some pointers.

316
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,436
That's enough, Tina.

317
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:03,438
You can hawk
your chop suey recipes

318
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:06,024
after Rachel shows us her solo
for Nationals.

319
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,609
Sue, that's
incredibly racist.

320
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,926
I can't be racist, William,

321
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:11,079
as I am 1/16
Native American.

322
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,982
My Comanche name
is Cheerleads With Wolves.

323
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,867
Okay, guys,
Nationals is coming up,

324
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,452
and it's all riding

325
00:12:17,453 --> 00:12:19,153
on the shoulders
of Rachel Berry.

326
00:12:19,154 --> 00:12:20,989
Rachel, why don't you come
up and show us what you got.

327
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,241
Mr. Shue, can I have
a couple days to think about it?

328
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,275
Could I get a second

329
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,410
to talk to my fiancée?

330
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,111
Sure.

331
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:28,296
Rachel, this isn't you.

332
00:12:28,297 --> 00:12:29,881
The Rachel that I
fell in love with

333
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,216
just nods to the band,
then starts wailing.

334
00:12:32,217 --> 00:12:34,285
Look, I know you got
a lot on your plate,

335
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,254
with New York and planning
our wedding and whatnot,

336
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,172
but you're at your best
when you're under pressure.

337
00:12:38,173 --> 00:12:40,291
Now, turn around
and show us

338
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,843
how you're going to
win us Nationals.

339
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,811
And afterwards, we're
going to make out

340
00:12:43,812 --> 00:12:46,898
because your boobs look slightly
bigger today for some reason.

341
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:57,575
♪ For all those times
you stood by me ♪

342
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:01,746
♪ For all the truth
that you made me see ♪

343
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:05,650
♪ For all the joy
you brought to my life ♪

344

Hey, Tina, can I talk to you?

393
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:16,808
I wanted to say
you're always

394
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,342
so good in my musical numbers.

395
00:16:18,343 --> 00:16:20,352
Your oohs and aahs
are always on pitch,

396
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,680
and your light sashaying makes
my tour de force performances

397
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,398
even more spine-tingling,
if that's even possible.

398
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,234
I appreciate it, and you.

399
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,785
Rachel, I can't tell you
how long

400
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,370
I've waited
to hear you say that.

401
00:16:29,371 --> 00:16:30,688
Just because you're

402
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,156
a little more
in the background this year,

403
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,125
don't doubt
your talent, Tina.

404
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,793
Next year is all you.

405
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:38,195
It's finally your chance
to shine.

406
00:16:41,216 --> 00:16:42,800
I couldn't believe it
when I heard that your

407
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,836
NYADA audition
didn't go well.

408
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,804
You're...
you're always so amazing.

409
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,873
I wish Madame Tibideaux
agreed with you.

410
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:51,542
So change her mind. I've tried.
She won't even return my calls.

411
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,144
That's not the Rachel Berry
I know.

412
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:54,929
If I were you,
I'd drive

413
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,265
to wherever she is and I'd stay

414
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,268
until I convinced Ms. Tibideaux
to give me another shot.

415
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,769
I can't believe
how supportive you are

416
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,721
when half the time,
I can't even be bothered

417
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,690
to thank you for your tremendous
supporting performances.

418
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,391
It's not completely selfless.

419
00:17:07,392 --> 00:17:09,076
You're our secret weapon,
Rachel Berry,

420
00:17:09,077 --> 00:17:11,112
and by helping you,
I help us all.

421
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,918
Oh, my God, Tina! Are you okay?
Get her! Get her! Get her!

422
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:19,754
Tina. Oh, my God, are you okay?
Ooh! Ooh, ooh!

423
00:17:19,755 --> 00:17:21,172
Ugh.

424
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:23,708
Did she have to take in the
bolt of fabric with her?

425
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,377
That silk charmeuse is worth,
like, 25 bucks a yard.

426
00:17:32,568 --> 00:17:34,219
A-five, six, seven, eight.

427
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,288
Mask, mask, helmet down.

428
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:38,406
Pivot, pivot.

429
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:40,242
Jump, mask, boys.

430
00:17:40,243 --> 00:17:43,060
A-one, two, three,
four, five, six.

431
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:45,213
Burn! Burn!

432
00:17:45,214 --> 00:17:46,581
Burn! Come on!

433
00:17:46,582 --> 00:17:47,716
Let it burn!

434
00:17:47,717 --> 00:17:49,084
Set this joint on fire!

435
00:17:49,085 --> 00:17:52,304
Come on, burn the joint down!

436
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:54,055
Okay, cut the music.
Stop! Stop.

437
00:17:54,056 --> 00:17:57,175
This is an unmitigated disaster.

438
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,628
Jennifer Beals
is spinning in her grave.

439
00:17:59,629 --> 00:18:04,065
Gentlemen, I asked for a cascade
of sparks timed to the rhythm.

440
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:06,968
- I can't see through this helmet.
- I took mine off.

441
00:18:06,969 --> 00:18:09,037
Metal sparks in your face is how you get freckles.
Is this even legal?

442
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:10,355
Yeah,
shouldn't we be in

443
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:11,639
some sort of grinding union?
Wanky.

444
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,774
Sue, they're right.

445
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:14,576
They can't pick up
advanced choreography

446
00:18:14,577 --> 00:18:16,661
when they're weighed down
by helmets and metal grinders.

447
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,947
Grind, grind, pivot, kick,
pivot, spin, flip, split.

448
00:18:18,948 --> 00:18:20,499
What's complicated
about that?

449
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,200
These props were supposed
to add to the routine,

450
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,502
not be the routine.

451
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:25,337
Well, maybe
you're right, William.

452
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:27,506
Maybe basic
sheet metal work

453
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:30,509
is just too much for
your 12th place choir.

454
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,827
Porcelain, thoughts?

455
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:35,046
I'm not doing a drag number.

456
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,598
We need a new approach.

457
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:38,266
I have an idea.

458
00:18:39,936 --> 00:18:41,853
This is the
teachers' lounge.

459
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,555
It is our sacred space.

460
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:45,190
Britt and I are gay
and Mercedes is black,

461
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:47,058
so kicking us out
would be a hate crime.

462
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,343
Well, I'm not totally
gay, but I think

463
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:49,811
that trees are born the
same way as babies,

464
00:18:49,812 --> 00:18:50,979
so kicking me out

465
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,113
would be
kind of mean.

466
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:53,448
Yeah. Thanks.

467
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:56,034
I'm eating my chicken, ladies.

468
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:57,685
You're still wearing
your wedding ring.

469
00:18:57,686 --> 00:18:58,954
And I saw you

470
00:18:58,955 --> 00:19:00,789
last night
at the 7:00 p.m. showing

471
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,857
of <i>21 Jump Street...</i>
with Cooter.

472
00:19:02,858 --> 00:19:04,626
Cooter was in <i>21 Jump Street?</i>

473
00:19:04,627 --> 00:19:06,294
I didn't know
he was an actor.

474
00:19:06,295 --> 00:19:07,462
You told us
you were leaving him.

475
00:19:07,463 --> 00:19:08,630
You lied to us.

476
00:19:08,631 --> 00:19:10,248
I know how this looks,

477
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,417
but you just don't understand
how complicated

478
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:14,169
adult relationships can be.

479
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,720
I mean, he hit you
and you stayed.

480
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,806
What's complicated
about that?

481
00:19:17,807 --> 00:19:20,425
I'm very sorry if this
is confusing for you,

482
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:22,093
but what's the world worth

483
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:23,979
if people don't get
a second chance?

484
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,981
Wait, so you're saying
he changed?

485
00:19:25,982 --> 00:19:29,734
Well, he knows now that if he
treats me bad again, I am out.

486
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,987
You're so selfish!

487
00:19:31,988 --> 00:19:34,356
You're selfish for
making me feel this way,

488
00:19:34,357 --> 00:19:36,157
and I hate feeling
like this.

489
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:37,892
You know you
push my buttons!

490
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,367
I don't know.

491
00:19:45,368 --> 00:19:46,734
Can people change that fast?

492
00:19:46,735 --> 00:19:48,286
I mean, most guys I know
don't even know how

493
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,071
- to change their own underwear.
- I couldn't really

494
00:19:50,072 --> 00:19:51,957
figure that out, so I just
stopped wearing any at all.

495
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,574
I think you need
to get out of the house,

496
00:19:53,575 --> 00:19:54,759
if only for a weekend.

497
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,077
Come with us
to Nationals.

498
00:19:56,078 --> 00:19:57,712
You have two
chaperones already.

499
00:19:57,713 --> 00:19:59,464
I don't even know
if I'm welcome

500
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,182
back in Chicago
after I body-slammed

501
00:20:01,183 --> 00:20:02,767
Refrigerator Perry
in a bar fight.

502
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,302
We care about you, Coach.

503
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,971
We just want to see you safe.

504
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:10,758
Thank you, girls,
but I can take care of myself.

505
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:15,480
Please ignore the
stench of mildew

506
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:16,865
and jock strap

507
00:20:16,866 --> 00:20:19,067
and focus your attention
on the screen.

508
00:20:19,068 --> 00:20:19,901
Porcelina?

509
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,989
Yesterday, I snuck into
a Vocal Adrenaline rehearsal,

510
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,274
and what I saw
is not for the faint of heart.

511
00:20:26,275 --> 00:20:27,409
Lights.

512
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,833
Why is this
in black and white?

513
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,084
Because I worship <i>The Artist.</i>

514
00:20:36,085 --> 00:20:37,502
Look at that.

515
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,804
Unlike you misfit,
ragtag stumblebums,

516
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:43,224
each member of Vocal Adrenaline
is in perfect sync.

517
00:20:43,225 --> 00:20:45,493
Not a step out of place.

518
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,562
Okay, watch this closely, guys.

519
00:20:47,563 --> 00:20:48,980
It's called the Human Centipede.

520
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,732
It's the newest, hardest

521
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:52,300
show choir dance move
ever invented.

522
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:53,868
Incredible.

523
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:55,803
That actually really
doesn't look that hard.

524
00:20:55,804 --> 00:20:57,305
And the cherry on top

525
00:20:57,306 --> 00:21:00,475
of the Vocal Adrenaline sundae
is their secret weapon, Unique.

526
00:21:00,476 --> 00:21:02,577
Look at him/her.

527
00:21:02,578 --> 00:21:04,746
Poised, confident.

528
00:21:04,747 --> 00:21:07,415
Pretty as a picture
with a booty that won't quit.

529
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:08,867
It's the Unique factor

530
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:10,785
that gives Vocal Adrenaline
its edge.

531
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,256
Isn't Rachel our
Unique factor?

532
00:21:15,257 --> 00:21:16,657
Not even close.

533
00:21:16,658 --> 00:21:17,792
I'm not saying
that Mrs. Focker

534
00:21:17,793 --> 00:21:19,094
doesn't deserve a solo,

535
00:21:19,095 --> 00:21:20,712
but every show choir
in the country

536
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:22,964
- has a little girl with a big nose.
- Okay, Sue.

537
00:21:22,965 --> 00:21:26,167
High school judges
are proven idiots.

538
00:21:26,168 --> 00:21:30,138
They love props, and Unique
is the ultimate prop.

539
00:21:30,139 --> 00:21:31,306
Do you seriously think
that we need

540
00:21:31,307 --> 00:21:32,891
a guy to dress in drag to win?

541
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:34,743
- No.
- Yes.

542
00:21:34,744 --> 00:21:37,645
It's the only way.

543
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:46,521
Sounded pretty good to me.

544
00:21:46,522 --> 00:21:48,540
I'm singing into the notes,
not through them,

545
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,542
but I'll get it.

546
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:52,627
It never stops
for you, does it?

547
00:21:52,628 --> 00:21:54,195
Well, I let myself
get overconfident once,

548
00:21:54,196 --> 00:21:56,064
and I'm not
going to let it happen again.

549
00:21:57,366 --> 00:21:59,634
Have you heard back
from Carmen Tibideaux yet?

550
00:21:59,635 --> 00:22:02,587
I just have to accept the
fact that I'm not going to.

551
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:04,005
I've e-mailed her
and called her,

552
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:06,141
and there's nothing left
that I can do.

553
00:22:06,142 --> 00:22:09,677
You could go see her.
It's what you suggested I do in

554
00:22:09,678 --> 00:22:11,279
the body-swapping
dream I had about us.

555
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,065
When I fell in the fountain at
the mall and hit my head.

556
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:16,267
It was like <i>Freaky Friday.</i>
I was you, and you were me,

557
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:19,053
and Kurt was Finn, and he wanted
to have sex with me, as you.

558
00:22:19,054 --> 00:22:20,405
That's very disturbing.

559
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:22,323
But then you, as Tina,
told me, as Rachel,

560
00:22:22,324 --> 00:22:23,858
"Go see Carmen Tibideaux in
person

561
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:25,393
and not take no for an answer."

562
00:22:25,394 --> 00:22:26,778
Okay, I'm very confused.

563
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:29,697
But the advice I gave myself in
your dream was good.

564
00:22:29,698 --> 00:22:32,450
I did some research.

565
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:35,170
Carmen Tibideaux is teaching
a master class at Oberlin.

566
00:22:35,171 --> 00:22:38,072
If we go right now,
we can still catch her.

567
00:22:38,073 --> 00:22:39,374
I could drive.

568
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:40,742
You would do that for me?

569
00:22:42,678 --> 00:22:44,629
Why? I mean, all that stuff
you said.

570
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,913
I mean, you weren't wrong.

571
00:22:45,914 --> 00:22:48,683
Look, everyone is important,

572
00:22:48,684 --> 00:22:51,519
and I'm very sorry if I made you
feel like a supernumerary.

573
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,637
I'm sorry.

574
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:55,023
Everyone has their part
to play, right?

575
00:22:55,024 --> 00:22:57,058
Maybe this is mine.

576
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,145
Thank you.

577
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:04,232
You do know that next year,

578
00:23:04,233 --> 00:23:05,567
you're going to be
the lead female vocalist.

579
00:23:05,568 --> 00:23:09,487
And it's a lot of pressure,
but I'm not worried.

580
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,657
Oh, no, please don't cry.

581
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:14,409
You need to drive
Is your Hyundai gassed-up?

582
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,211
Since Porcelain refuses
to be a team player

583
00:23:16,212 --> 00:23:17,662
and dress up like a lady,

584
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:20,131
we're gonna have
to up our prop game.

585
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:22,783
I've ordered 18 little people,
one for each of you.

586
00:23:22,784 --> 00:23:24,302
Wait. Little people?

587
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:25,753
Munchkins.
I found 'em online, William.

588
00:23:25,754 --> 00:23:27,505
And don't worry,
I got a mix of race

589
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:29,957
and ethnicities so you can keep up
with your little diversity charade.

590
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:32,310
I can't dance with a little
person. I can hardly walk.

591
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:33,961
There's that can don't attitude,
Quinn.

592
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:37,065
Sue, I think maybe we are going
a little too far with the props.

593
00:23:37,066 --> 00:23:39,567
Let's just spend some time working
on choreography for "Dash Board."

594
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:41,802
Sure, if you want to lose.

595
00:23:41,803 --> 00:23:43,354
Puck?

596
00:23:44,773 --> 00:23:45,573
Hello...

597
00:23:45,574 --> 00:23:46,441
My eyes are burning.

598
00:23:46,442 --> 00:23:47,609
Look at those legs.

599
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,861
I am strangely
turned on right now.

600
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:52,197
Please only address me
by my stage name... Lola.

601
00:23:52,198 --> 00:23:54,082
Puckerman, I respect your
commitment to winning,

602
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:56,751
but without a doubt, you are the
ugliest woman I have ever seen.

603
00:23:56,752 --> 00:23:58,620
For a second there, I thought
you were Beiste's sister.

604
00:23:58,621 --> 00:23:59,787
It's not about being pretty.

605
00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:01,089
It's about someone in here
having the balls

606
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,091
to do what he has to do
to put us over the top.

607
00:24:03,092 --> 00:24:04,759
Well, you know, if this is gonna
work, you're gonna have

608
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,760
to shave off all of
your body hair.

609
00:24:05,761 --> 00:24:06,794
Enough!

610
00:24:06,795 --> 00:24:07,962
Sue, look, I really appreciate

611
00:24:07,963 --> 00:24:09,514
all the help
you've been giving us

612
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:10,965
but I am done with all
this props madness.

613
00:24:10,966 --> 00:24:12,600
All we're doing for the
next three hours

614
00:24:12,601 --> 00:24:14,352
is learning choreography
for "Dash Board."

615
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:16,187
Puck, go change.

616
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:17,889
You cannot see
something like that.

617
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,942
William, I'm oddly aroused by
your sudden forcefulness,

618
00:24:20,943 --> 00:24:23,194
and I will let you
handle this rehearsal,

619
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,196
however, I feel it
necessary to warn you:

620
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,615
I prepaid for
the little people.

621
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:32,820
It's the darkest day in Ohio
since Ernest Byner. Boy, how the

622
00:24:32,821 --> 00:24:34,038
mighty have
truly fallen, huh?

623
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,907
Take a good look
at him, boys.

624
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:39,294
This empty, useless shell of a
man you see before you used

625
00:24:39,295 --> 00:24:41,028
to be the Noah Puckerman,

626
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:42,863
the guy they named the Dumpster
out by the smoking lounge

627
00:24:42,864 --> 00:24:44,966
after 'cause he had dumped
more dweebs in it

628
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:45,866
than any ten dudes
combined.

629
00:24:45,867 --> 00:24:47,252
Keep rocking that mullet, Ricky,

630
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:49,554
Maybe it a few years it will
come back in style.

631
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:52,473
And today he finally succumbed
to the toxic fumes of Glee Club

632
00:24:52,474 --> 00:24:55,226
and came to school wearing a fricking dress.
Are you looking

633
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,812
to pick a fight? 'Cause there's
three of you and one of me,

634
00:24:57,813 --> 00:24:59,931
so you're gonna you'd need
about two more guys

635
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:01,683
to make it a fair fight,
you fricking loser.

636
00:25:01,684 --> 00:25:02,901
Oh, I'm a loser?

637
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:04,569
Did I tell you I got
into Ohio State?

638
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,987
Yeah, I'm gonna
play hockey there.

639
00:25:05,988 --> 00:25:08,055
What's your plan
after graduation?

640
00:25:08,056 --> 00:25:11,225
Oh, that's right,
you aren't graduating.

641
00:25:11,226 --> 00:25:13,027
Face it, Puck,
you're the guy

642
00:25:13,028 --> 00:25:15,613
we all used to make fun
of when we were freshman.

643
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,165
The one who used to hang out
hung out in front of the 7-11

644
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:18,583
picking up on high school girls
after graduating.

645
00:25:18,584 --> 00:25:20,285
In two months you'll
be buying

646
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:22,287
my little brother beer
and just begging him

647
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:24,923
to take you to a party.
You're a Lima loser.

648
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:27,008
I'm going to rip that mullet off
your head.

649
00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:29,460
You want to fight, fine.
But not here.

650
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:30,678
Out by your Dumpster.

651
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:32,797
See, I don't want
to get in trouble.

652
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:34,766
'Cause unlike you,
I got a lot to lose.

653
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:44,492
How's the wedding
planning going?

654
00:25:44,493 --> 00:25:47,429
Kind of slow lately, but we
still have the same plan:

655
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,631
win Nationals, come back,
graduate, and then

656
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:51,833
just have a nice little church
wedding performed

657
00:25:51,834 --> 00:25:53,835
by a rabbi with our
nearest and dearest.

658
00:25:53,836 --> 00:25:56,722
And hopefully nobody will get
tragically injured this time.

659
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:59,174
You think we're gonna win
Nationals?

660
00:25:59,175 --> 00:26:01,810
You know, our first Regionals
and last year,

661
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:03,979
I had this feeling, like
we were just gonna win.

662
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,513
But this year, nothing.

663
00:26:05,514 --> 00:26:07,866
I just really, really,
want to win, though.

664
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:09,818
If not for us,
then for Mr. Schue.

665
00:26:11,204 --> 00:26:15,073
What if we go all this way,
and Carmen just says no?

666
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,358
She won't.
She might.

667
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:18,293
I don't have a back up plan,
all right?

668
00:26:18,294 --> 00:26:20,045
And I don't want to waste
lose a year

669
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:21,213
of my ingenue eligibility.

670
00:26:21,214 --> 00:26:22,497
You always make it
so hard,

671
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:24,333
but you were born under
a blessed gold star.

672
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:25,634
Everyone knows it.

673
00:26:25,635 --> 00:26:27,803
I don't know if I think
that way anymore.

674
00:26:27,804 --> 00:26:30,305
I mean, think of most
of the adults we know, okay?

675
00:26:30,306 --> 00:26:33,058
I bet you that things used to
go their way all the time,

676
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:34,559
and then one day,
just, they didn't.

677
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,211
And now they
have a job they hate

678
00:26:36,212 --> 00:26:38,313
and they live a life that
they don't even recognize.

679
00:26:38,314 --> 00:26:40,933
And I bet you that they don't
even bother to dream anymore.

680
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:41,934
That's not everyone.

681
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:43,185
Yeah, but most people.

682
00:26:46,906 --> 00:26:50,325
No. Okay. I'm not going
there yet.

683
00:26:50,326 --> 00:26:52,560
Carmen is going to say yes.

684
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:54,613
There's the Rachel Berry
we all know and love.

685
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:58,233
Yeah, I'm really glad
we're doing this together.

686
00:26:58,234 --> 00:27:00,168
Thank you.

687
00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:01,703
Can you do me one favor?

688
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:04,589
Before you graduate,
can we sing together?

689
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:07,843
I would love that.

♪ She's a mania, maniac... ♪

691
00:27:13,349 --> 00:27:15,717
Last chance to walk away

692
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:17,252
with whatever teeth
you have left, Stickhead.

693
00:27:17,253 --> 00:27:19,521
Please. I just hope you brought
a change of clothes

694
00:27:19,522 --> 00:27:20,722
'cause you're going
Dumpster diving.

695
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:22,424
But hey, maybe while
you're in there,

696
00:27:22,425 --> 00:27:23,892
you'll find your garbage father.

697
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:26,094
How's he doing,
by the way?

698
00:27:26,095 --> 00:27:28,196
You know, I tried his microbrew.
It sucked.

699
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,817
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!

700
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:33,035
Game on.

701
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,606
Oh!

702
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,328
Hit him! Hit him! Hit him!
Take him down!

703
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:47,782
Hit him!

704
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:52,804
Hit him!

705
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:55,307
Hit him! Hit him!

706
00:28:02,899 --> 00:28:05,350
Let's just make this easy.
Hop in there yourself.

707
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:06,468
Come on, man!

708
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:21,116
The reign
of Noah Puckerman is over!

709
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:25,420
Your winner,
and still a loser.

710
00:28:25,421 --> 00:28:30,926
Loser! Loser!
Loser! Loser! Loser! Loser!

711
00:28:30,927 --> 00:28:32,594
Ah, you want some more,
there, Nancy?

712
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:37,349
Whoa! Whoa, dude.
What the hell you doing, man?

713
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,717
I'm not a loser!

714
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:40,969
Drop it!
Get over here!

715
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:41,836
Drop it!

716
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:47,192
The show's over!
Everybody go home!

717
00:28:47,193 --> 00:28:49,844
Get out of here!

718
00:28:51,364 --> 00:28:52,647
Except for you.

719
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:54,282
Come on!

720
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:58,370
A knife?!

721
00:28:58,371 --> 00:29:00,572
It's rubber. It's just a prop
from <i>West Side Story.</i>

722
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:01,873
What the hell are you thinking?!

723
00:29:01,874 --> 00:29:03,325
You could get expelled for this!

724
00:29:03,326 --> 00:29:04,626
It doesn't matter.
I'm flunking out!

725
00:29:04,627 --> 00:29:05,860
You've got a record!

726
00:29:05,861 --> 00:29:07,329
You could get
arrested for assault!

727
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,530
I don't care!

728
00:29:08,531 --> 00:29:10,048
Well, you damn well should care!

729
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:11,416
I'm nothing!

730
00:29:13,052 --> 00:29:15,087
Don't you get it?!
I'm nothing!

731
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:17,806
I'm the school joke!
A failure!

732
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:21,643
You don't know what it's like
to be worthless,

733
00:29:21,644 --> 00:29:23,178
where nothing you do matters!

734
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:25,931
I feel that way every day
of my life!

735
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:27,715
Every damn day!

736
00:29:27,716 --> 00:29:30,352
You know how many
football games or concerts

737
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:33,522
my mom's been to in the last four years?
None. Not one.

738
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:36,274
My dad's been AWOL since
I was ten years old,

739
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:39,611
which is fine because all he ever
did was tell me I was garbage!

740
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:41,446
And he must be really
proud of himself

741
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:42,897
'cause that's exactly
how I turned out!

742
00:29:47,403 --> 00:29:49,037
I'm sorry.

743
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:51,289
I'm sorry.

744
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,241
Come here.

745
00:29:53,242 --> 00:29:56,595
I'm sorry!

746
00:29:56,596 --> 00:30:00,465
You know, you and me,
we're badasses.

747
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:04,970
Nobody thinks
anything hurts us, but it does.

748
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:07,088

but the phrasing is still
emotionally flaccid.

755
00:30:47,452 --> 00:30:49,169
Emotionally flaccid.

756
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:50,287
Thank you, Madame Tibideaux.

757
00:30:51,289 --> 00:30:52,184
Thank you.

758
00:30:53,758 --> 00:30:55,909
Madame Tibideaux, hello.
I'm sorry to interrupt,

759
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,127
but it's me, Rachel Berry.

760
00:30:58,129 --> 00:30:59,763
I'm sorry.
I realize that I've

761
00:30:59,764 --> 00:31:01,381
been a little persistent,
but I'm just...

762
00:31:01,382 --> 00:31:05,614
I am a very busy woman.

763
00:31:06,721 --> 00:31:08,421
Every moment I spend deleting

764
00:31:08,422 --> 00:31:10,307
yet another one of your
voicemails

765
00:31:10,308 --> 00:31:12,309
about lost hopes and dreams

766
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,311
takes time away
from another student.

767
00:31:14,312 --> 00:31:17,030
What makes you think you
are entitled

768
00:31:17,031 --> 00:31:20,433
to any more attention than
other hundreds of people I see

769
00:31:20,434 --> 00:31:21,935
with the same hopes
and dreams?

770
00:31:21,936 --> 00:31:24,437
No. I'm so sorry. I don't mean
to take time away from them.

771
00:31:24,438 --> 00:31:26,240
But you do.

772
00:31:26,241 --> 00:31:27,774
And I'm tired of it.

773
00:31:27,775 --> 00:31:29,827
Ms. Tibideaux, I know
exactly how you feel.

774
00:31:29,828 --> 00:31:31,712
Rachel Berry is
a pain in the ass.

775
00:31:31,713 --> 00:31:34,047
What she wants, she gets.

776
00:31:34,048 --> 00:31:36,783
And I've spent a lot of time
resenting her for it.

777
00:31:36,784 --> 00:31:39,953
But the fact is, she gets
it because she's exceptional.

778
00:31:39,954 --> 00:31:41,839
Not just the voice,
which is sick,

779
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,091
but the focus, the drive.

780
00:31:44,092 --> 00:31:46,310
How often do you come across
the real deal?

781
00:31:46,311 --> 00:31:48,846
The "real deal" that couldn't
remember the words to the song?

782
00:31:48,847 --> 00:31:51,298
Which was as rare as a Bigfoot sighting.
She had an off day,

783
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:52,599
and that decides
her entire future?

784
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,768
Ms. Tibideaux, I realize
that I'm asking you

785
00:31:54,769 --> 00:31:56,803
to take me into special
consideration.

786
00:31:56,804 --> 00:31:59,323
but let me ask you.
You've had an amazing career,

787
00:31:59,324 --> 00:32:01,158
did you get there
by playing by it safe?

788
00:32:03,995 --> 00:32:06,613
Please, we're performing
our Nationals in Chicago,

789
00:32:06,614 --> 00:32:08,615
and we saw that you're gonna
be singing there

790
00:32:08,616 --> 00:32:10,000
at the Lyric Opera.

791
00:32:10,001 --> 00:32:12,152
And before you close the door,
I just,

792
00:32:12,153 --> 00:32:14,922
I need you to hear me sing.
I have to.

793
00:32:14,923 --> 00:32:17,457
There's nothing that
I'm as good at

794
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:21,011
or as passionate about or that
brings me that much joy.

795
00:32:21,012 --> 00:32:22,930
And I think that
that sets me apart.

796
00:32:26,134 --> 00:32:29,269
And I think it's time for you
and your friend to go.

797
00:32:31,522 --> 00:32:34,308
Okay, but I just want you
to know that...

798
00:32:34,309 --> 00:32:36,676
I'll see you again next year.

799
00:32:36,677 --> 00:32:38,695
And every year after
that until I get in.

800
00:32:38,696 --> 00:32:41,398
Didn't I read somewhere
that you

801
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:42,983
auditioned for Juilliard
four times?

802
00:32:46,854 --> 00:32:48,455
Thank you.

803
00:33:00,385 --> 00:33:01,885
Hey, baby.

804
00:33:01,886 --> 00:33:03,387
I got us a couple of pies.

805
00:33:03,388 --> 00:33:05,305
Hawaiian, your favorite.

806
00:33:08,209 --> 00:33:10,894
I'm sorry, Shannon.

807
00:33:10,895 --> 00:33:12,963
You know how sorry I am.

808
00:33:12,964 --> 00:33:15,766
Listen, guy
from Michigan

809
00:33:15,767 --> 00:33:18,551
has been poaching every
kid I took a sniff of

810
00:33:18,552 --> 00:33:20,654
and everyone's on my ass

811
00:33:20,655 --> 00:33:23,824
and, if I'm being
totally honest...

812
00:33:25,994 --> 00:33:28,829
I'm always feeling like
I'm disappointing you.

813
00:33:30,531 --> 00:33:34,734
And... it doesn't matter.

814
00:33:34,735 --> 00:33:36,336
You know why?

815
00:33:36,337 --> 00:33:39,373
'Cause I know I can't
lose my cool anymore,

816
00:33:39,374 --> 00:33:41,091
and I won't.

817
00:33:41,092 --> 00:33:42,476
I promise.

818
00:33:44,929 --> 00:33:47,014
Oh, come on, baby, sit
down. We're celebrating.

819
00:33:47,015 --> 00:33:50,050
You remember that, uh, that
bear of a lineman I told you

820
00:33:50,051 --> 00:33:51,885
I was hot on from
Newton South?

821
00:33:51,886 --> 00:33:53,937
Got him to sign on
the dotted line!

822
00:33:57,191 --> 00:33:58,976
Come on, baby.

823
00:34:01,429 --> 00:34:02,763
You got my word.

824
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,625
What, are you gonna stab me?

825
00:34:15,626 --> 00:34:16,776
Not with that one.

826
00:34:16,777 --> 00:34:18,128
It's fake.

827
00:34:18,129 --> 00:34:19,963
Maybe the big one
in the kitchen.

828
00:34:19,964 --> 00:34:23,783
The one I've been sleeping
with at night under my pillow.

829
00:34:23,784 --> 00:34:26,453
Oh, God.

830
00:34:26,454 --> 00:34:28,422
Baby, I'm so sorry.

831
00:34:30,391 --> 00:34:32,559
I mean, how did we let it
get so out of hand?

832
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,527
I'm out.

833
00:34:35,596 --> 00:34:37,848
I got shame about what
happened between us,

834
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:41,268
but I leave that here
with my ring and with you.

835
00:34:41,269 --> 00:34:43,854
Oh, please, please.

836
00:34:43,855 --> 00:34:47,190
Don't... don't leave me, okay?

837
00:34:47,191 --> 00:34:51,111
You can't hate me anymore
than I already hate myself.

838
00:34:51,112 --> 00:34:52,779
I don't hate you!

839
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,448
That's the awful part of it.

840
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:55,832
I love you!

841
00:34:55,833 --> 00:34:59,453
But what does that say
about what I think of me?

842
00:35:03,257 --> 00:35:06,343
What are you gonna do, huh,
just walk out on me?

843
00:35:06,344 --> 00:35:09,346
Who's going to love you
the way I loved you, Shannon?

844
00:35:09,347 --> 00:35:11,798
Who's going to love you now?

845
00:35:13,935 --> 00:35:15,802

So why are you in here singing
all by your lonesome?

880
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:45,418
Just trying out a song
for Nationals.

881
00:37:45,419 --> 00:37:47,120
I gotta win at something.

882
00:37:47,121 --> 00:37:49,506
Well, you may not know it,
but you already have.

883
00:37:49,507 --> 00:37:51,424
I talked to
Mrs. Doosenberry.

884
00:37:51,425 --> 00:37:54,294
She's gonna let you have
another go at that test.

885
00:37:54,295 --> 00:37:56,179
Why? She hates me.

886
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,830
Hated your attitude.

887
00:37:57,831 --> 00:37:59,666
But I told her
how you wiggled

888
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:02,001
into a skirt for the
good of your team.

889
00:38:02,002 --> 00:38:03,503
She's into that?

890
00:38:03,504 --> 00:38:04,804
Oh, should've known
Doosenberry was a lady-lover

891
00:38:04,805 --> 00:38:06,673
when she didn't climb
aboard the Puck wagon.

892
00:38:06,674 --> 00:38:10,360
No, when you did that, you showed
that you cared about something.

893
00:38:10,361 --> 00:38:14,013
Something way bigger
than just you.

894
00:38:14,014 --> 00:38:15,982
That's all she ever
wanted from you.

895
00:38:15,983 --> 00:38:18,451
That's all any of us
teachers ever wanted.

896
00:38:18,452 --> 00:38:21,488
So, you're gonna
retake the exam

897
00:38:21,489 --> 00:38:23,990
next week, and I'm gonna
help you through it.

898
00:38:23,991 --> 00:38:26,693
Why would you do that,
help me like that?

899
00:38:26,694 --> 00:38:31,248
Because, Noah, you will never
know how much you've helped me.

900
00:38:32,633 --> 00:38:34,251
You are loved, punkin.

901
00:38:34,252 --> 00:38:36,369
You are not alone.

902
00:38:44,475 --> 00:38:45,642
Aah, I pricked my thumb!

903
00:38:45,643 --> 00:38:47,477
Okay, Costume Committee?

904
00:38:47,478 --> 00:38:48,845
Sucks.

905
00:38:48,846 --> 00:38:50,096
Why do we have
to do all the work?

906
00:38:50,097 --> 00:38:51,481
Quinn says
it's because we're the newbies,

907
00:38:51,482 --> 00:38:53,182
- and we gotta pay our dues.
- Whatever.

908
00:38:53,183 --> 00:38:56,069
It's ridick the seniors treat us
like plebes.

909
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,987
I mean, this is Rachel
Berry's dress, right?

910
00:38:57,988 --> 00:38:59,639
She should sew it herself.

911
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,475
Rachel is probably practicing
her songs right now,

912
00:39:02,476 --> 00:39:03,809
over and over again,

913
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:05,612
until her vocal chords bleed.

914
00:39:05,613 --> 00:39:07,614
And none of us would
be going to Chicago

915
00:39:07,615 --> 00:39:09,549
if not for her commitment
to Glee Club,

916
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,000
so show some respect.

917
00:39:11,001 --> 00:39:12,952
While we're acting like
shrubbery in the background?

918
00:39:12,953 --> 00:39:15,455
Put in the work...

919
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:17,123
be a good team player,

920
00:39:17,124 --> 00:39:18,824
and you'll get your solos.

921
00:39:18,825 --> 00:39:20,293
And maybe next year
it'll be

922
00:39:20,294 --> 00:39:22,795
as part of a group
that won Nationals.

923
00:39:22,796 --> 00:39:24,830
And this costume
is yours, Sugar,

924
00:39:24,831 --> 00:39:26,799
but I'm happy
to be sewing it.

925
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,018
Because the truth is,

926
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:32,722
it takes a lot of crystals
to make something shine.

927
00:39:39,563 --> 00:39:42,231
Now, that's great, and then
we shift to the Trouble Tones

928
00:39:42,232 --> 00:39:44,150
for Gaga's "Edge of Glory,"
which is up-tempo.

929
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:46,786
I like this.
This will work.

930
00:39:46,787 --> 00:39:49,739
William, I can taste
your Axe Body Spray.

931
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:51,958
Hey, you.

932
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:54,577
Going somewhere, Shannon?

933
00:39:54,578 --> 00:39:56,913
I'd like to be a chaperone
for Nationals.

934
00:39:56,914 --> 00:39:59,165
I'll pay my own way
and I'll sleep on the bus.

935
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:01,367
You don't have to
sleep on the bus.

936
00:40:01,368 --> 00:40:03,252
I'm sure we
can make room.

937
00:40:03,253 --> 00:40:05,004
I booked an executive
maternity suite.

938
00:40:05,005 --> 00:40:07,307
Sharing it wouldn't be fair
to the baby.

939
00:40:07,308 --> 00:40:09,509
You can bunk with me and Emma.

940
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:13,313
So you packed a bag on the off-chance
you'd be coming to Chicago?

941
00:40:13,314 --> 00:40:17,183
I left him.

942
00:40:25,058 --> 00:40:26,609
Welcome aboard, Shannon.

943
00:40:29,196 --> 00:40:32,031
If it wasn't for Tina, I would never
have gone to see Carmen Tibideaux.

944
00:40:32,032 --> 00:40:34,334
Yeah, she's like
an offensive lineman.

945
00:40:34,335 --> 00:40:35,752
She always in the trenches,

946
00:40:35,753 --> 00:40:37,787
picking up blitzers so the
quarterback can lead the drive.

947
00:40:37,788 --> 00:40:40,590
Sorry, you lost me at
"offensive lineman,"

948
00:40:40,591 --> 00:40:43,209
but I'm sure whatever
you said was really nice.

949
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:46,262
All right, there's no other option
but just to exceed all expectations.

950
00:40:46,263 --> 00:40:48,014
We have to win
at Nationals.

951
00:40:48,015 --> 00:40:49,265
There's no alternative.

952
00:40:49,266 --> 00:40:50,633
You know, you really
are our "Unique Factor."

953
00:40:50,634 --> 00:40:52,435
Ah, it's

954
00:40:52,436 --> 00:40:54,804
"You know, I did hundreds
and hundreds of movies.

955
00:40:54,805 --> 00:40:57,523
Now, two mice jumped
into a bucket of cream and..."

956
00:40:57,524 --> 00:40:59,091
No, no, I think we all are.

957
00:40:59,092 --> 00:41:00,810
I mean, in a sea full of kids

958
00:41:00,811 --> 00:41:02,928
who are just desperately
clinging to their own kind,

959
00:41:02,929 --> 00:41:04,230
we're different.

960
00:41:04,231 --> 00:41:07,400
We took the time
to get to know each other

961
00:41:07,401 --> 00:41:09,369
and reach out
and accept one other.

962
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,604
That's our "Unique Factor."

963
00:41:11,605 --> 00:41:13,823
And that's what I love about us.

964
00:41:13,824 --> 00:41:15,708
