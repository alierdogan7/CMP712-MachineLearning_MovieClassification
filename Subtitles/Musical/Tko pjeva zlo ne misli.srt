5
00:00:48,767 --> 00:00:51,483
<i>after our first date.</i>

6
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:56,271
<i>It's night now</i>

7
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:00,193
<i>deep darkness makes me sad</i>

8
00:01:01,273 --> 00:01:04,342
<i>all alone in her bed</i>

9
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:08,296
<i>Marijana is so late.</i>

10
00:01:10,264 --> 00:01:11,900
<i>And I'm</i>

11
00:01:12,381 --> 00:01:16,053
<i>alone under a palm</i>

12
00:01:16,537 --> 00:01:20,003
<i>sleep is closing up my eyes</i>

13
00:01:20,653 --> 00:01:22,766
<i>all sad, I'm longing</i>

14
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,362
<i>for the day to come.</i>

15
00:01:25,767 --> 00:01:28,437
<i>Oh, Marijana</i>

16
00:01:29,803 --> 00:01:33,428
<i>sweet little Marijana</i>

17
00:01:33,878 --> 00:01:37,072

<i>My name is Perica Šafranek.</i>

35
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,709
<i>Dad says we're the model
of an honest Zagreb family...</i>

36
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:44,746
<i>... and that there should be
a book on us.</i>

37
00:04:44,992 --> 00:04:47,140
<i>Therefore I write a diary...</i>

38
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,776
<i>... so all can be read
in a thousand years!</i>

39
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:52,902
I'll be right back.

40
00:04:53,263 --> 00:04:55,013
- Going over to Znidaršiæ's.
- Again!

41
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,689
No, we'll chat on Abyssinia

42
00:04:57,938 --> 00:04:59,450
story from the papers.

43
00:04:59,656 --> 00:05:01,849
Fine excuse! Been a while
since you were drunk!

44
00:05:02,054 --> 00:05:04,645
No, no, really!

45
00:05:04,891 --> 00:05:07,243
You've no idea how tight
the situation is.

46
00:05:07,448 --> 00:05:09,835
Only Abyssinians won't
give up, my dear.

47
00:05:10,365 --> 00:05:12,115
They're a tough nut to crack!

48
00:05:12,922 --> 00:05:16,672
<i>Mom says our neighbors
are Babbitts, but Dad says...</i>

49
00:05:16,878 --> 00:05:18,514
<i>... it's none
of our business.</i>

50
00:05:19,116 --> 00:05:22,070
<i>Aunt Bajs lives one floor
below us, has a cat...</i>

51
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:23,982
<i>... and lots of game trophies.</i>

52
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,185
<i>People say she provided
them for her husband.</i>

53
00:05:27,387 --> 00:05:28,977
<i>But I doubt it...</i>

54
00:05:29,185 --> 00:05:32,696
<i>... since Mr. Bajs goes hunting,
while Aunt Bajs has no rifle at all!</i>

55
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,729
<i>Across the courtyard
are Auntie Beta and Mr. Karlek.</i>

56
00:05:36,856 --> 00:05:39,970
<i>He's a chimney sweeper.
So when he passes by,</i>

57
00:05:40,093 --> 00:05:42,888
<i>we hold a button to make
our wish come true.</i>

58
00:05:55,676 --> 00:05:56,994
<i>Miss Marijana also lives...</i>

59
00:05:57,075 --> 00:05:58,472
<i>... in our courtyard.</i>

60
00:05:58,633 --> 00:06:00,747
<i>She presses shirts.</i>

61
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,825
<i>Coming with shirts are clients.</i>

62
00:06:04,027 --> 00:06:07,652
<i>Those without them are relatives.
When a relative comes,</i>

63
00:06:07,943 --> 00:06:11,057
<i>she pulls down the blinds,</i>

64
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:14,528
<i>because they have
some important talks!</i>

65
00:06:15,734 --> 00:06:18,768
<i>The old Mr. Miško says it
was better in the old days.</i>

66
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:22,121
<i>Aunt Mina belongs to us,
too. Doesn't live with us...</i>

67
00:06:22,367 --> 00:06:25,674
<i>... but comes almost every day.
Dad says it's not because...</i>

68
00:06:25,923 --> 00:06:28,912
<i>... we're beautiful people,
but because of the dinner!</i>

69
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:33,705
You've read this book, huh?

70
00:06:33,955 --> 00:06:35,750
Just reading it.

71
00:06:35,993 --> 00:06:38,106
Lend it to me later?

72
00:06:41,107 --> 00:06:42,505
How do you like it?

73
00:06:44,543 --> 00:06:47,259
Don't know...
It's nothing much.

74
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,046
- A bit too big.
- It's the latest fashion...

75
00:06:50,297 --> 00:06:52,490
in all magazines.

76
00:06:52,735 --> 00:06:55,485
Wide brim,
and the front bent down.

77
00:06:55,771 --> 00:06:57,999
You know nothing
about fashion.

78
00:07:10,675 --> 00:07:13,982
Listen... if you won't wear
this one, give it to me.

79
00:07:14,591 --> 00:07:16,466
Fits me perfectly!

80
00:07:23,062 --> 00:07:26,051
Here you are! Ana,
Franjo's here, we can eat!

81
00:07:26,338 --> 00:07:28,566
- How do you like it?
- What?

82
00:07:28,936 --> 00:07:29,845
The hat.

83
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,968
Why did you give
that hat to Mina?

84
00:07:35,968 --> 00:07:37,558
What's wrong with it?

85
00:07:37,686 --> 00:07:40,834
Come now, daddy! It was
out of fashion 2 years ago.

86
00:07:40,963 --> 00:07:43,713
It may be fashionable again.

87
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:46,027
She asked me, she's poor.

88
00:07:46,157 --> 00:07:46,986
Poor?!

89
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:50,824
Eats here, keeps money
in the bank! I'm not blind...

90
00:07:50,952 --> 00:07:52,906
Hush, she'll hear you!

91
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,262
- Let's eat.
- Let her hear!

92
00:07:55,707 --> 00:07:57,457
I'll tell her myself, right now!

93
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,694
Good!

94
00:08:14,566 --> 00:08:15,793
Delicious!

95
00:08:15,925 --> 00:08:18,834
What's in this gravy?
It's so good.

96
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:21,269
Stop gnawing at that bone,
you'll break your teeth.

97
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:24,110
There's marrow in it,
it's very healthy.

98
00:08:26,074 --> 00:08:29,222
Ana, wrap a slice of beef
for me,

99
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,186
for supper.

100
00:08:31,908 --> 00:08:34,419
Franjo, the beef is
excellent today, right?

101
00:08:34,665 --> 00:08:36,778
Don't know!
Where are the papers?

102
00:08:37,022 --> 00:08:38,772
Haven't seen where you
put them.

103
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,207
What, papers?
Here they are!

104
00:08:41,298 --> 00:08:43,650
I was reading
the installment of a novel.

105
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,167
Leave the last page, please.

106
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:49,401
Take everything and read,
I'll go over to Znidaršiæ's!

107
00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:51,046
Wait, daddy, there's desert.

108
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:52,246
<i>Don't want it!</i>

109
00:08:52,246 --> 00:08:54,518
Is Franjo perhaps mad?

110
00:08:54,643 --> 00:08:57,393
You know him. Got up on the wrong
side of the bed today.

111
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,350
SUNDAY

112
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,503
Morning, Auntie,
we're going on a picnic!

113
00:09:07,749 --> 00:09:10,056
Stop yelling like an oaf!

114
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,739
I'll go over to Znidaršiæ's
while mom gets ready.

115
00:09:12,864 --> 00:09:14,420
'Morning, madame!

116
00:09:14,542 --> 00:09:16,734
- 'Morning! Have fun!
- Thanks!

117
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:22,922
Good morning!

118
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:24,205
- How are you?
- Fine, and you?

119
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:25,446
I'm holding on.

120
00:09:28,127 --> 00:09:30,241
- Why are you yelling?
- We're going on a picnic.

121
00:09:30,325 --> 00:09:31,200
So what?

122
00:09:31,603 --> 00:09:32,512
<i>Dad!</i>

123
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,156
- Dad, let's go!
- Right!

124
00:09:37,557 --> 00:09:39,829
Give me a quick one.

125
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,624
It's good for my stomach.

126
00:09:43,311 --> 00:09:46,344
If Baldwin says: "Enough!",
Mussolini goes with his

127
00:09:46,827 --> 00:09:50,020
<i>...tail between his legs!
- A Mussolini drink?</i>

128
00:09:50,143 --> 00:09:51,097
No!

129
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:52,740
Oh, come on!

130
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,134
They're all rascals,
I trust no one!

131
00:09:56,576 --> 00:09:58,644
Excuse me, that's not true.

132
00:09:58,734 --> 00:10:02,086
You're right about Mussolini,
but Baldwin's the man!

133
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,164
Franjo, where's your sense?!

134
00:10:04,568 --> 00:10:05,522
I'm coming!

135
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:08,000
Put it on my tab,
got to hurry!

136
00:10:08,324 --> 00:10:09,119
<i>Franjo!</i>

137
00:10:13,718 --> 00:10:15,354
- Bye-bye!
- Bye, neighbor!

138
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,261
You arranged this stupidly!

139
00:10:24,386 --> 00:10:26,261
Look who's talking!
If we're late...

140
00:10:26,464 --> 00:10:28,976
...it won't be Mina's fault,
but you know whose!

141
00:10:29,181 --> 00:10:31,170
Excuse me?!
You can't blame me!

142
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,657
Who waited for whom?

143
00:10:32,777 --> 00:10:34,175
<i>Perica?!</i>

144
00:10:34,536 --> 00:10:36,728
Don't make a scene!
What will people think?

145
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:38,247
They can kiss my ass!

146
00:10:43,126 --> 00:10:45,080
Shame on you, such words...

147
00:10:45,284 --> 00:10:46,761
O. K., I can also be silent!

148
00:10:47,601 --> 00:10:50,431
My respects...
Perica, say hello to Mrs. Kos.

149
00:10:53,315 --> 00:10:55,906
- What time is it?
- Don't ask me anything!

150
00:10:56,192 --> 00:10:58,310
Note that I'm offended

151
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,661
and won't utter a word!

152
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:01,502
Wait, Perica...

153
00:11:10,577 --> 00:11:13,724
<i>It's so pretty, it's so pretty,
our green Zagorje</i>

154
00:11:13,853 --> 00:11:16,887
<i>with its black and
smoky choo-choo train...</i>

155
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:20,443
<i>with its black and
smoky choo-choo train...</i>

156
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,198
<i>Take your seat, take it now,
hear the whistle blowing...</i>

157
00:11:24,402 --> 00:11:27,595
<i>hear the whistle blowing...</i>

158
00:11:27,798 --> 00:11:29,434
<i>Take your seat, take it now,</i>

159
00:11:29,596 --> 00:11:31,152
<i>hear the whistle blowing</i>

160
00:11:31,314 --> 00:11:34,348
<i>it will take you
to fair Zagreb-town!</i>

161
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:37,864
<i>It will take you
to fair Zagreb-town!</i>

162
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:40,783
Childr en... let's see what
you've brought to eat.

163
00:11:41,703 --> 00:11:44,772
I took nothing, thinking
you'd take too much anyway...

164
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,656
...and it would be pity
to throw away food.

165
00:11:48,256 --> 00:11:50,290
My Lord, what's that?!
A nut loaf!

166
00:11:51,373 --> 00:11:53,362
Let me taste a slice...

167
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,234
You know, it's delicious!

168
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,161
It sure is.

169
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:04,354
Only... not enough stuffing.

170
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,473
Don't eat if don't I ike it!

171
00:12:06,876 --> 00:12:09,592
No, I said it
was delicious!

172
00:12:09,913 --> 00:12:11,902
- Perica, you'll taste it? No?
- No!

173
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:15,898
Franjo, admit your wife's
a wonderful cook!

174
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:18,731
Don't eat the whole cake,
it'll be better after.

175
00:12:18,983 --> 00:12:21,494
- Let me...
- No, no, it's perfect now.

176
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,297
Honest to God, it's terrific!

177
00:12:24,617 --> 00:12:25,526
Delicious.

178
00:12:26,894 --> 00:12:28,769
They have nothing here!

179
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:31,363
Mom, I'm thirsty!

180
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:33,758
You'll have a drink later.
First we'll go to church.

181
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:35,677
Perica, come with me.
I'll buy you a soda.

182
00:12:35,965 --> 00:12:38,317
Starting on booze already?

183
00:12:38,722 --> 00:12:40,597
Excuse me! First, I'm not
going to the church.

184
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,471
And one spritzer
is my own business!

185
00:12:43,756 --> 00:12:45,392
Fine! Perica, let's go...

186
00:12:45,554 --> 00:12:48,020
Besides, I'm not
talking to you today!

187
00:12:50,349 --> 00:12:53,543
I admire you, my dear.
How can you stand him?

188
00:12:53,785 --> 00:12:56,172
- It's so hot...
- I'd be offended,

189
00:12:56,463 --> 00:12:58,213
wouldn't even look at him!

190
00:13:13,165 --> 00:13:14,915
Look how nice it is, Mina!

191
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,187
Perica, stop, you'll fall!

192
00:13:29,387 --> 00:13:32,535
- I won't! There's a view.
- We'll look later!

193
00:13:32,743 --> 00:13:33,891
Come down this minute.

194
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,489
Give me your hand.

195
00:13:41,774 --> 00:13:43,171
Let's go,
Aunt Mina's waiting.

196
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,619
<i>Like two Iittle doves</i>

197
00:14:08,825 --> 00:14:11,211
<i>so happy</i>

198
00:14:11,462 --> 00:14:14,928
<i>we were</i>

199
00:14:16,097 --> 00:14:20,926
<i>From one little mug</i>

200
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:23,127
<i>we used</i>

201
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:28,198
<i>to drink there...</i>

202
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,257
Let's go to the
observation tower!

203
00:14:45,225 --> 00:14:47,691
We've for gotten to bring
flowers to St. Ann.

204
00:14:47,942 --> 00:14:50,056
I remembered in the church
and gave a coin instead.

205
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,896
I couldn't give for you,
I ran out of change...

206
00:14:52,977 --> 00:14:55,693
<i>...and a ten would be too much!
- Just a moment, madame!</i>

207
00:14:55,774 --> 00:14:56,489
What?

208
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:59,967
- Oh, Lord...
- Don't! Why?

209
00:15:01,408 --> 00:15:03,044
It's already done.
Thank you very much.

210
00:15:03,765 --> 00:15:06,640
I know it's impolite
to attack a lady so...

211
00:15:06,882 --> 00:15:09,234
...but I hope you'll excuse...

212
00:15:09,439 --> 00:15:13,144
...my Iittle intrusion.
Permit me, my name is Fulir.

213
00:15:13,435 --> 00:15:15,707
Pleased to meet you. Šafranek.

214
00:15:16,552 --> 00:15:18,585
It'd be an honor to know...

215
00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:21,182
...where to deliver the photo.
I'm sure...

216
00:15:21,426 --> 00:15:23,415
...it's going to be great.
- You think so?

217
00:15:23,664 --> 00:15:25,891
Only we won't pay for it.

218
00:15:26,101 --> 00:15:28,408
There was no deal!

219
00:15:28,619 --> 00:15:32,005
You can't force us to pay,
for get about it!

220
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:33,288
- Mina...
- Right!

221
00:15:33,493 --> 00:15:35,607
You've got me all wrong!
I'm not...

222
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,316
...a street-photographer,
I don't do it for money...

223
00:15:38,967 --> 00:15:41,035
...but for artistic pleasure.
- Ah, so!

224
00:15:41,764 --> 00:15:44,992
Take no offense, please,
I didn't know.

225
00:15:45,281 --> 00:15:48,667
So many people took
pictures of me...

226
00:15:48,757 --> 00:15:53,542
asking for money in advance.
But I never got the photos!

227
00:15:53,632 --> 00:15:55,063
Right, Ana?

228
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,937
Madame, another shot, please.

229
00:15:58,746 --> 00:16:00,462
Don't... why me?

230
00:16:01,463 --> 00:16:04,338
- Let him, it's free!
- Look here...

231
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,772
No, stay as you are.

232
00:16:08,456 --> 00:16:10,808
Only raise your head a bit.

233
00:16:11,093 --> 00:16:12,524
Fine, stay that way!

234
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,917
Madam, you've got a very
photogenic face. Excuse me...

235
00:16:16,007 --> 00:16:18,155
Look here...

236
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:19,717
- Where?
- Get lost!

237
00:16:20,203 --> 00:16:22,668
Don't move!
Look up here...

238
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,396
Say cheese!

239
00:16:27,355 --> 00:16:29,628
Done! My respects...

240
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,059
May I ask you something?

241
00:16:31,271 --> 00:16:33,941
You make only one photo, or
more? I'd like...

242
00:16:34,148 --> 00:16:36,341
...to have one.
Only I'm afraid...

243
00:16:36,585 --> 00:16:40,893
...I was covering
my face with the fan...

244
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,213
This is going to be
an artistic composition.

245
00:16:43,418 --> 00:16:44,929
Your head bent forward...

246
00:16:45,056 --> 00:16:48,965
...sunlight on your hair,
clouds and sky in the back.

247
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,001
You'll be beautiful.

248
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,083
- Pity it's not in color.
- Think so?

249
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:55,873
- You mean it?
- I'm positive!

250
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,033
- Your hand, please.
- Steep stairs...

251
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:03,228
You're such a gentleman.

252
00:17:04,995 --> 00:17:07,825
We should really go now.
I'm sorry...

253
00:17:08,031 --> 00:17:10,259
May I take the Iiberty
of visiting you?

254
00:17:10,868 --> 00:17:12,618
It was a real pleasure.

255
00:17:13,386 --> 00:17:15,374
Perica, thank the gentleman
for the ice-cream.

256
00:17:15,623 --> 00:17:17,373
- Thank you.
- It's nothing!

257
00:17:17,781 --> 00:17:20,372
I feel dizzy!

258
00:17:20,618 --> 00:17:23,129
Good-bye.
Thanks for your company.

259
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,523
You're welcome.

260
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,236
<i>You are most beautiful</i>

261
00:17:31,846 --> 00:17:34,516
<i>of all the women</i>

262
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,953
<i>only to be yours</i>

263
00:17:39,078 --> 00:17:42,669
<i>that is my dream...</i>

264
00:17:45,311 --> 00:17:49,300
- Their singing is beautiful.
- Beautiful? Nonsense!

265
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,224
This modern music
is just affectation.

266
00:17:52,344 --> 00:17:54,014
You need no voice for that.

267
00:17:54,142 --> 00:17:55,732
To you modern is nonsense.

268
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,166
You know only Let's Drink
and The Battle is On.

269
00:17:59,576 --> 00:18:01,610
Those are old Croatian songs.

270
00:18:01,694 --> 00:18:03,682
And The Battle is On is from
our national opera Zrinski,

271
00:18:03,811 --> 00:18:06,527
...if you really want to know.
- Tastes differ.

272
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,390
<i>Mina, what does
photogenic mean?</i>

273
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:15,311
- What?
- You know...

274
00:18:15,479 --> 00:18:17,831
Photogenic?
Probably has something...

275
00:18:18,036 --> 00:18:20,593
...to do with photos.
Ask Franjo.

276
00:18:20,873 --> 00:18:22,304
What does he know...

277
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,062
Perica, come and eat!

278
00:18:31,981 --> 00:18:33,970
- You know who he reminds me of?
- No.

279
00:18:34,139 --> 00:18:35,536
- Clark Gable.
- Right!

280
00:18:35,737 --> 00:18:37,964
<i>From the movie San Francisco.</i>

281
00:18:38,254 --> 00:18:41,402
- We saw it together!
- He was just as romantic...

282
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,084
Today's men are rude
as peasants!

283
00:18:45,287 --> 00:18:46,638
- Oh, yes...
- Why?

284
00:18:46,845 --> 00:18:49,402
I can be ever so polite.

285
00:18:49,602 --> 00:18:52,511
In the office they tell me
I'm quite a gentleman.

286
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:55,469
We're talking about a man
we just met.

287
00:18:55,795 --> 00:18:58,148
A Mr. Fulir.

288
00:18:58,392 --> 00:19:00,585
- What... Fulir?
- Yes.

289
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,943
Sounds familiar! My boss's
relative is Fulir.

290
00:19:04,066 --> 00:19:04,941
Maybe that's him.

291
00:19:05,065 --> 00:19:06,292
Listen...

292
00:19:06,424 --> 00:19:09,413
Listen, he's tall, elegant,
small mustache...

293
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,456
- And has green eyes.
- What green? Brown!

294
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,129
- Green, I saw them!
- No, brown!

295
00:19:15,414 --> 00:19:17,448
And a bit longer
hair... artistic!

296
00:19:17,692 --> 00:19:19,919
Shame I missed him.

297
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:21,560
I'd have someone to talk to.

298
00:19:22,446 --> 00:19:23,355
Perica!

299
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,679
Jesus and Mary!
Have you seen that?

300
00:19:33,155 --> 00:19:35,303
The kids are shameless today!

301
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,985
<i>Well, some bush-work...</i>

302
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,979
...wouldn't harm you, either!

303
00:19:40,986 --> 00:19:42,020
You scoundrel!

304
00:19:42,105 --> 00:19:44,333
How can you, swine?!
Such words...

305
00:19:45,062 --> 00:19:47,255
Alright, I'm a swine.
Thanks a lot!

306
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,892
I can't joke any more!
I don't have the manners...

307
00:19:50,976 --> 00:19:53,282
...of those novel fakes!

308
00:19:53,413 --> 00:19:55,367
But you can tell I'm a swine...

309
00:19:55,451 --> 00:19:56,962
...in front of a child!
- No, wait...

310
00:19:57,049 --> 00:19:59,560
Goodbye!
Expect me when you see me!

311
00:19:59,646 --> 00:20:01,203
- Where are you...
- None of your business!

312
00:20:02,204 --> 00:20:04,158
It's all occupied!

313
00:20:04,241 --> 00:20:06,548
It's your fault, Franjo!

314
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:08,514
You had to get plastered first!

315
00:20:08,597 --> 00:20:11,108
You could have gone ahead,
I need no escort!

316
00:20:11,234 --> 00:20:12,631
Let's go back!

317
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,501
Miss, there's a place
for you here!

318
00:20:17,627 --> 00:20:19,934
- Then I'm going to take it!
- For you, miss...

319
00:20:20,024 --> 00:20:24,934
She's my sister, and she's married!
Franjo! Ana! I've got a seat!

320
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:26,649
Thank you very much!

321
00:20:27,297 --> 00:20:30,683
- It's full, let's go back.
- They can go to hell!

322
00:20:32,011 --> 00:20:34,318
Mom, there's Mr. Fulir!

323
00:20:37,046 --> 00:20:37,841
Hurry!

324
00:20:41,162 --> 00:20:42,878
- Give me your hand!
- Leave me alone!

325
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,551
I'm not drunk!

326
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:47,150
- Don't tell me I'm drunk!
- Hurry!

327
00:20:50,072 --> 00:20:50,901
Thank you...

328
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,618
Over here, madam!

329
00:20:54,148 --> 00:20:56,375
I've only one seat,
unfortunately. Take it.

330
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,619
Thanks, but it's yours.

331
00:20:58,783 --> 00:21:01,816
- Please sit, I'll stand.
- No, no, thank you.

332
00:21:01,899 --> 00:21:04,331
- I can stand, really.
- Wait! I'll sit...

333
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:07,883
...if you won't.
My legs are hurting.

334
00:21:08,692 --> 00:21:10,169
- Franjo...
- It's so hot...

335
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,484
Now you've lost your seat.
I'm sorry...

336
00:21:12,728 --> 00:21:15,682
- This is my husband...
- My pleasure.

337
00:21:16,044 --> 00:21:18,509
This is the gentleman
we told you about.

338
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:22,508
You're the one?
Thanks for the seat.

339
00:21:23,356 --> 00:21:26,231
Sure, but I gave it to madam...

340
00:21:27,472 --> 00:21:29,699
Perhaps you know Dr. Brlek?

341
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,459
- Who?
- Dragec Brlek.

342
00:21:31,547 --> 00:21:33,263
- I think you're related.
- No.

343
00:21:33,345 --> 00:21:35,095
No? Then it's another Fulir.

344
00:21:35,463 --> 00:21:37,452
Dr. Brlek is my boss.

345
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,213
A pleasure...

346
00:21:41,337 --> 00:21:42,485
- We're moving!
- Yes...

347
00:21:51,845 --> 00:21:55,629
<i>You'll fall in love
in a moment</i>

<i>'cause love makes
our  lives so fine...</i>

354
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:24,928
Madame, you've got
a beautiful voice!

355
00:22:25,449 --> 00:22:28,199
Don't... I can't sing at all.

356
00:22:28,446 --> 00:22:30,560
Who told you that? You sing
with such a feeling...

357
00:22:30,803 --> 00:22:32,712
- Please, go on.
- No...

358
00:22:32,961 --> 00:22:34,279
I beg you.

359
00:22:35,718 --> 00:22:36,752
<i>If you insist...</i>

360
00:22:38,915 --> 00:22:40,904
<i>I'm in love</i>

366
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,841
<i>thank you, my heart,</i>

367
00:23:04,527 --> 00:23:06,914
<i>you know the feeling

368
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,835
MONDAY

369
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:17,151
<i>This morning Dad didn't go to work.
He said his head was Iike a barrel...</i>

370
00:23:17,273 --> 00:23:21,182
<i>... about to blow!
So Mom had to tie it tightly...</i>

371
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:22,496
<i>... with a towel.</i>

372
00:23:23,347 --> 00:23:25,858
They were selling slop,

373
00:23:26,264 --> 00:23:30,172
double-crossing swine.
They should be hanged!

374
00:23:34,335 --> 00:23:38,006
I'd give anything for
a chili pepper or a pickle.

375
00:23:42,286 --> 00:23:44,161
<i>I'm in love</i>

376
00:23:44,844 --> 00:23:48,957

<i>'cause that is what

381
00:24:04,183 --> 00:24:06,217
<i>thank you, my heart...</i>

382
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:09,613
- You're rarely cheerful.
- Is it bothering you?

383
00:24:09,737 --> 00:24:12,930
On the contrary, go ahead.
It's more pleasant here.

384
00:24:17,888 --> 00:24:19,683
I've been thinking...

385
00:24:21,524 --> 00:24:23,035
Liked that Fulir guy?

386
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:24,879
Fulir? Why?

387
00:24:27,518 --> 00:24:30,631
See... I think he'd be
a good match for Mina.

388
00:24:31,194 --> 00:24:32,910
- You're nuts!
- No, no...

389
00:24:32,992 --> 00:24:36,583
It  really is a good idea.
Mina would agree, I'm sure.

390
00:24:36,868 --> 00:24:40,061
- Well?
- You and your absurd ideas!

391
00:24:40,144 --> 00:24:41,371
Why? It's true...

392
00:24:42,302 --> 00:24:44,859
...she's a bit older.
But it's nothing.

393
00:24:44,979 --> 00:24:47,171
We all have weak points.

394
00:24:49,374 --> 00:24:52,488
TUESDAY

395
00:24:54,489 --> 00:24:58,318
Bottles and old iron buying!

396
00:24:59,803 --> 00:25:05,315
Bottles and old iron buying!

397
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:08,024
Bottles!

398
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:17,898
Bottles and old iron buying!

399
00:25:19,861 --> 00:25:22,531
- Bottles!
- Here you are...

400
00:25:22,618 --> 00:25:24,846
- Mr. Fulir is coming!
- Who?

401
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:26,282
Mr. Fulir!

402
00:25:28,292 --> 00:25:30,723
Pardon, madam,
for my impertinence...

403
00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:34,721
- Perhaps it's a bad time?
- No, not at all!

404
00:25:35,404 --> 00:25:39,313
- On the contrary! Come on in.
- This is for you...

405
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,874
For me?

406
00:25:41,078 --> 00:25:43,510
Take this...
Thank you, you shouldn't have.

407
00:25:44,275 --> 00:25:46,309
Come into the house.

408
00:25:50,388 --> 00:25:53,183
Bottles... and old iron!

409
00:26:02,056 --> 00:26:04,090
- This way...
- Thank you.

410
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,799
Well, the shots
are very good!

411
00:26:10,087 --> 00:26:12,315
I'm surprised
how photogenic you are.

412
00:26:12,564 --> 00:26:15,553
- You're only flattering me!
- No, I'm serious.

413
00:26:16,161 --> 00:26:19,547
- Would you like some coffee?
- Since you're so kind...

414
00:26:19,637 --> 00:26:21,829
You I can't refuse.

415
00:26:22,234 --> 00:26:25,428
- When will we see the photos?
- Come, behave yourself!

416
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:27,339
I apologize.

417
00:26:27,468 --> 00:26:30,104
Sit down, I'll bring the coffee.

418
00:26:30,225 --> 00:26:31,213
Thank you.

419
00:26:33,022 --> 00:26:33,897
Right away...

420
00:27:07,265 --> 00:27:09,731
- What was your name, my boy?
- Perica.

421
00:27:09,823 --> 00:27:12,891
I'm sure you're going
to school.

422
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:15,326
- Which grade?
- I'll start the third now.

423
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:16,564
Really?

424
00:27:20,411 --> 00:27:23,320
- Daddy's not home?
- No, he's in the office.

425
00:27:25,046 --> 00:27:27,796
Know what? I'll show you
the pictures,

426
00:27:27,923 --> 00:27:29,877
...then you can go out and play.
- Sure!

427
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,829
Wait...

428
00:27:36,074 --> 00:27:37,949
Here... this is you.

429
00:27:52,696 --> 00:27:54,571
- You've got a nice boy!
- Really?

430
00:27:56,452 --> 00:27:58,203
Coffee'll be right away.

431
00:28:00,448 --> 00:28:02,801
When is your daddy
coming home?

432
00:28:03,525 --> 00:28:06,718
Sorry to keep you waiting,
I did my best.

433
00:28:07,121 --> 00:28:09,586
- Help yourself.
- Thank you so much.

434
00:28:09,718 --> 00:28:11,832
But first I'd like
to show you the pictures.

435
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:14,342
Perica, you can go
and play now.

436
00:28:15,752 --> 00:28:16,899
Sorry...

437
00:28:19,587 --> 00:28:21,576
Here you are all together.

438
00:28:22,704 --> 00:28:25,613
Perica... can you draw, huh?

439
00:28:25,741 --> 00:28:27,457
Sure.

440
00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:30,528
Draw me a nice horse,
and I'll g ive you 2 coins.

441
00:28:30,815 --> 00:28:31,769
OK!

442
00:28:36,369 --> 00:28:38,835
You've got a piano!
Must be you play it.

443
00:28:39,126 --> 00:28:41,115
Yes... no!
Perica is taking lessons.

444
00:28:41,324 --> 00:28:44,630
But he's on vacation now.
Play something, Perica.

445
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,307
<i>- Don't feel like it!
- Thanks...</i>

446
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,029
...madam, no need.

447
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:52,950
Unfortunately,
here you moved...

448
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:56,305
...the picture's not sharp.
But this one's really...

449
00:28:56,548 --> 00:28:59,059
<i>...comme il faut.</i>

450
00:29:00,344 --> 00:29:01,411
Very charming...

451
00:29:02,182 --> 00:29:03,659
<i>It's a real pity...</i>

452
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:07,615
...that you're not an actress
with such a photogenic face.

453
00:29:07,815 --> 00:29:09,963
- Come on... not true!
- I'm serious!

454
00:29:10,133 --> 00:29:12,769
Look at those features,
the expression...

455
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:16,196
It's wonderful...

456
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,318
<i>Perica... know what?</i>

457
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:26,833
Go someplace lighter,
you'll ruin your eyes.

458
00:29:27,035 --> 00:29:29,626
Maybe you're a gifted painter...

459
00:29:30,191 --> 00:29:31,941
With kids you can never tell.

460
00:29:32,069 --> 00:29:33,467
- Where do I go, Mom?
- Don't know...

461
00:29:34,027 --> 00:29:36,095
Try the yard,
a lot of light there.

462
00:29:36,265 --> 00:29:39,492
- It's not nice to...
- It's very nice there!

463
00:29:40,101 --> 00:29:41,248
He says it's nice...

464
00:29:43,217 --> 00:29:45,445
Help yourself to the coffee,
it probably got cold.

465
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:03,311
Here we're at a spa,
five years ago.

466
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:05,107
- Incredible!
- Why?

467
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:08,627
What a figure! You're not
aware how good you look.

468
00:30:09,189 --> 00:30:11,462
Come on, you say that
to every woman...

469
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:14,896
<i>Don't you know...</i>

470
00:30:15,303 --> 00:30:18,609
<i>- ... how I adore you...
- Excuse me...</i>

471
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:21,131
<i>- I'm an honest woman!
- Mom!</i>

472
00:30:22,215 --> 00:30:23,567
Here, I did it!

473
00:30:24,852 --> 00:30:26,330
- I drew a horse!
- Fine...

474
00:30:26,611 --> 00:30:29,565
Have some more coffee. My
husband will be here soon.

475
00:30:30,327 --> 00:30:33,713
Then I'll go. I wasn't
thinking of staying too long.

476
00:30:34,003 --> 00:30:36,275
- I drew a horse!
- Nice... fine.

477
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,390
- Terrific!
- Two coins, please.

478
00:30:38,598 --> 00:30:40,825
You're so impertinent!

479
00:30:41,075 --> 00:30:42,711
It's not his fault...

480
00:30:43,233 --> 00:30:47,380
Here... two coins for candy
for being such a good boy.

481
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:49,458
- Thanks!
- You're a real gentleman.

482
00:30:49,706 --> 00:30:50,932
It's nothing, madam.

483
00:30:51,624 --> 00:30:54,532
- Have you thanked him?
- Of course I have!

484
00:30:58,896 --> 00:30:59,850
<i>Madame...</i>

485
00:31:00,854 --> 00:31:02,444
I almost for got!

486
00:31:03,371 --> 00:31:04,961
- Pictures...
- Here you are...

487
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:06,566
- Thank you.
- I'll be...

488
00:31:07,926 --> 00:31:09,642
...on my way now.
- Already?

489
00:31:10,643 --> 00:31:14,598
We should talk in private.

490
00:31:14,918 --> 00:31:17,793
- When can we meet?
- That is not possible.

491
00:31:18,595 --> 00:31:20,469
I'm sorry...

492
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,664
<i>Think about it. My motto is
fairness and discretion.</i>

493
00:31:26,186 --> 00:31:30,095
Tomorrow afternoon in the
Zrinjevac Park pavilion.

494
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,097
- It's im possible!
- Madame...

495
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,413
- It's out of the question!
- Your final word?

496
00:31:35,536 --> 00:31:37,889
Yes... no!
My husband's coming!

497
00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:52,028
Excuse me...

498
00:31:52,718 --> 00:31:54,434
You look familiar...

499
00:31:54,556 --> 00:31:57,511
That's Mr. Fulir!
I drew a horse...

500
00:31:57,632 --> 00:32:00,064
...and he gave me 2 coins!
- Oh, it's you, Fulir!

501
00:32:01,069 --> 00:32:04,102
- I was just asking about you.
- What brings you here?

502
00:32:04,265 --> 00:32:06,458
My pictures from that picnic.

503
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:08,855
- How much are they?
- You'll only offend me.

504
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,690
I did it as a friend.

505
00:32:11,857 --> 00:32:13,811
Then at least we'll
have a drink.

506
00:32:14,175 --> 00:32:16,129
Perica, fetch a bottle
from Znidaršiæ's.

507
00:32:16,252 --> 00:32:18,047
Thanks, I can't now.

508
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,959
I'm in a hurry.

509
00:32:20,048 --> 00:32:22,276
Hey, what's one bottle?

510
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:25,477
<i>You prefer white or red?
Perhaps Plješivica?</i>

511
00:32:25,562 --> 00:32:28,392
<i>- If you insist...
- Perica, Plješivica!</i>

512
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:31,195
- And mineral water...
- Got it upstairs.

513
00:32:32,715 --> 00:32:33,941
<i>After you! Please...</i>

514
00:32:38,828 --> 00:32:42,658
<i>For one brief moment</i>

515
00:32:43,103 --> 00:32:45,092
<i>of happiness</i>

516
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:50,612
<i>a thousand days</i>

517
00:32:51,055 --> 00:32:54,282
<i>of sorrowfulness...</i>

518
00:32:57,808 --> 00:32:59,000
Bravo, madame!

519
00:32:59,885 --> 00:33:02,840
Dear Fulir, it's great
two of us have met.

520
00:33:02,922 --> 00:33:03,990
Right!

521
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:07,473
Cheers!

522
00:33:08,156 --> 00:33:08,793
Madame...

523
00:33:10,993 --> 00:33:13,663
What do you do, if I may ask?

524
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,821
What do I do?

525
00:33:15,988 --> 00:33:18,102
Mostly acquisitions lately.

526
00:33:18,385 --> 00:33:20,738
You can earn a lot that way!

527
00:33:21,462 --> 00:33:23,690
With good co nnections.
A guy who built a house...

528
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,570
...in a posh area with that.
- Šoštariæ!

529
00:33:27,056 --> 00:33:29,931
I think you should stick to art.

530
00:33:30,013 --> 00:33:34,081
- You really understand it.
- You are quite right.

531
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,879
But today's provincialism...

532
00:33:36,086 --> 00:33:39,280
Tell me, who's interested
in art today?

533
00:33:39,403 --> 00:33:42,630
- Yes, it's sad.
- It's quite different abroad.

534
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:44,987
- Ah, abroad...
- Excuse me...

535
00:33:45,157 --> 00:33:47,190
Are you married?

536
00:33:48,073 --> 00:33:49,790
- No, I'm single.
- Really?

537
00:33:49,871 --> 00:33:50,667
A bachelor.

538
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,941
- Told you!
- Nonsense!

539
00:33:54,067 --> 00:33:56,737
Tell you something.
Best thing for you...

540
00:33:56,864 --> 00:33:59,933
...is to find a good woman,
preferably with money.

541
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,497
<i>- There you have it!
- What do you know...</i>

542
00:34:03,497 --> 00:34:05,008
<i>...what's best?
- Not everybody is so fortunate...</i>

543
00:34:05,135 --> 00:34:08,840
...to find such a charming wife.

544
00:34:09,171 --> 00:34:12,477
She's not so bad.
There are worse!

545
00:34:13,446 --> 00:34:16,435
<i>- He's always like this.
- But I'm different.</i>

546
00:34:16,802 --> 00:34:19,189
I need freedom!

547
00:34:20,279 --> 00:34:23,824
I'd join an expedition
to Amazonia any time!

548
00:34:23,915 --> 00:34:25,949
- Really?
- Or Congo!

549
00:34:26,072 --> 00:34:28,822
- You wouldn't be afraid?
- Never! This stout heart...

550
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:31,177
...could hunt beasts
bare handed!

551
00:34:31,307 --> 00:34:33,454
You're always talking
rubbish drunk!

552
00:34:34,224 --> 00:34:36,815
Told you thousand times
you don't understand me.

553
00:34:36,901 --> 00:34:39,093
But let's not discuss it now.

554
00:34:39,618 --> 00:34:41,970
Excuse me... gotta go.

555
00:34:52,004 --> 00:34:54,152
You must be mad at me.

556
00:34:54,642 --> 00:34:58,426
A great shame if we don't
make some more pictures.

557
00:34:58,757 --> 00:35:00,950
- It's not convenient...
- Don't refuse!

558
00:35:01,035 --> 00:35:03,069
- I've got to see you in private.
- No, I can't.

559
00:35:03,192 --> 00:35:04,306
My husband...

560
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,743
Stop torturing me!
Well?

561
00:35:09,346 --> 00:35:10,300
Don't know...

562
00:35:15,979 --> 00:35:19,933
<i>For just one glance
of your eyes</i>

563
00:35:21,253 --> 00:35:23,401
<i>I'd give my life...</i>

564
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,761
<i>I'd give my life...</i>

565
00:35:28,046 --> 00:35:32,512
<i>For just one glance
of your eyes</i>

566
00:35:33,919 --> 00:35:36,192
<i>I'd give my life</i>

567
00:35:37,396 --> 00:35:41,384
<i>my life away...</i>

568
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,901
<i>I'd give my life</i>

569
00:35:44,828 --> 00:35:49,737
<i>my life away!</i>

570
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:55,017
What a pity you haven't
become a singer.

571
00:35:55,017 --> 00:35:58,846
- You're just flattering me.
- Four years I sang in a choir.

572
00:35:58,932 --> 00:36:02,046
A bass!
Those were the days!

573
00:36:05,325 --> 00:36:11,394
<i>Without you, dear,
oh, my sweet</i>

574
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:14,554
<i>I can not live now</i>

575
00:36:15,794 --> 00:36:18,624
<i>I can not live now</i>

576
00:36:20,189 --> 00:36:25,974
<i>Without you, dear,
oh, my sweet,</i>

577
00:36:26,463 --> 00:36:30,293
<i>I can not live</i>

578
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:37,245
<i>but have to die...</i>

579
00:36:39,089 --> 00:36:40,487
<i>That was fine, my man.</i>

580
00:36:40,607 --> 00:36:41,925
Great!

581
00:36:42,086 --> 00:36:43,961
You have a great
backup voice, Fulir!

582
00:36:44,124 --> 00:36:45,874
It was better while...

583
00:36:46,002 --> 00:36:47,672
...madame was leading.

584
00:36:48,319 --> 00:36:51,751
In this song soprano leads,
bass is backup.

585
00:36:52,235 --> 00:36:54,110
- Why?
- Because!

586
00:36:55,431 --> 00:36:56,579
Listen, Fulir.

587
00:36:57,269 --> 00:37:00,099
Don't you lecture me.
You know zip about singing.

588
00:37:00,226 --> 00:37:01,976
Excuse me, I know a lot!

589
00:37:02,224 --> 00:37:03,894
<i>Nonsense!</i>

590
00:37:04,022 --> 00:37:06,658
...you know zip!
You're just showing off!

591
00:37:07,578 --> 00:37:09,215
- That's rubbish.
- Franjo...

592
00:37:09,736 --> 00:37:12,964
- I see the wine is pretty strong.
- Wine?

593
00:37:13,172 --> 00:37:15,001
It's got nothing
to do with it!

594
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:16,959
You're impossible!

595
00:37:17,088 --> 00:37:19,918
Stop defending him! I'm not
a kid, I need no lessons!

596
00:37:27,517 --> 00:37:29,551
I think it's time for me to go.

597
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:32,306
- No one's keeping you!
- How can you?!

598
00:37:32,671 --> 00:37:36,342
It's beneath my dignity
to fight here,

599
00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:40,661
but I can't stand insults!
Madame...

600
00:37:41,781 --> 00:37:42,577
Good-bye!

601
00:37:44,019 --> 00:37:46,167
My respects...

602
00:37:46,696 --> 00:37:50,207
<i>Be thankful I didn't break
your nose! You to teach me!</i>

603
00:37:51,611 --> 00:37:52,884
The scoundrel!

604
00:37:56,126 --> 00:37:57,240
I heard it right?

605
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,638
Yes! Think I'm afraid?

606
00:37:59,722 --> 00:38:02,438
<i>- Stupid ass!
- You insolent dope!</i>

607
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:04,030
<i>Your dad is a dope!</i>

608
00:38:04,117 --> 00:38:06,788
You told him off good,
Mr. Franjo!

609
00:38:07,114 --> 00:38:09,262
Had he just moved,
I'd have smashed him!

610
00:38:09,472 --> 00:38:10,664
Neighbor...

611
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:15,140
He provoked it!
Say a word...

612
00:38:15,705 --> 00:38:17,261
...and tomorrow he's dead!

613
00:38:18,022 --> 00:38:19,659
<i>If it weren't for Mina...</i>

614
00:38:19,781 --> 00:38:21,848
Enough, go to sleep.

615
00:38:22,138 --> 00:38:22,967
I'm tired.

616
00:38:24,855 --> 00:38:28,730
See, I'm never tired.
I've so much energy.

617
00:38:29,011 --> 00:38:32,840
I could break all this
into pieces, set it on fire...

618
00:38:33,126 --> 00:38:38,275
...and say: "Give me a plane, I
volunteer as a pilot in Abyssinia!"

619
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,829
What plane?!
Come to your senses.

620
00:38:42,476 --> 00:38:44,590
If you had my sense...

621
00:38:44,834 --> 00:38:47,470
...you'd get a memorial plate
above your kitchen stove.

622
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,781
You're wrong if you think...

623
00:38:50,907 --> 00:38:53,418
<i>...he's smarter than me.
- He's a gentleman...</i>

624
00:38:53,504 --> 00:38:54,902
...and doesn't talk
rubbish like you!

625
00:38:55,302 --> 00:38:57,609
Funny how you're defending him.

626
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,813
You're always defending
strangers against me.

627
00:39:05,771 --> 00:39:07,725
THE MODERN SINNER

628
00:39:07,849 --> 00:39:09,838
Where's my youth...

629
00:39:16,759 --> 00:39:19,828
WEDNESDAY

630
00:39:48,525 --> 00:39:49,240
<i>Perica...</i>

631
00:39:49,364 --> 00:39:50,557
Not with the knife!

632
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,754
- What's with the peas?
- Why?

633
00:39:55,557 --> 00:39:57,864
They're so tough
my stomach hurts!

634
00:39:57,995 --> 00:40:00,870
No wonder
after three helpings.

635
00:40:01,591 --> 00:40:03,818
If I eat too much,
don't invite me!

636
00:40:03,908 --> 00:40:04,657
Stop it, girls.

637
00:40:06,026 --> 00:40:07,299
Listen, Mina...

638
00:40:07,464 --> 00:40:10,498
Listen, I'd I ike to discuss
an idea since you're here.

639
00:40:10,701 --> 00:40:14,326
- Oh? What is it?
- What do you think about Fulir?

640
00:40:15,136 --> 00:40:15,693
Fulir?

641
00:40:17,614 --> 00:40:20,488
<i>What do you think about
him... as a man?</i>

642
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:22,356
Don't start again!

643
00:40:22,648 --> 00:40:25,637
You stay out of it.
I asked Mina.

644
00:40:26,044 --> 00:40:27,442
Well?

645
00:40:28,402 --> 00:40:29,719
Well... I don't know.

646
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,797
He is nice.

647
00:40:32,198 --> 00:40:36,505
Why are you asking?
He mentioned something?

648
00:40:36,593 --> 00:40:37,741
I doubt...

649
00:40:37,912 --> 00:40:38,946
...you'll find...

650
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,218
...a better match.

651
00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:43,543
- Enough of that nonsense!
- Why nonsense?

652
00:40:43,785 --> 00:40:46,217
He can find
a wife himself!

653
00:40:46,462 --> 00:40:48,849
No harm in talking, right?

654
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,736
- Hope you don't mind!
- I'm only saying...

655
00:40:51,976 --> 00:40:53,965
...you're reckoning
without the host!

656
00:40:54,134 --> 00:40:55,770
I can see I annoy you!

657
00:40:56,212 --> 00:40:59,326
You made peas knowing
I don't like them!

658
00:40:59,488 --> 00:41:02,318
In that case... I can go!

659
00:41:02,885 --> 00:41:06,112
Calm down, Your Highness.

660
00:41:06,521 --> 00:41:08,396
I can't speak
in my own house...

661
00:41:08,479 --> 00:41:09,228
Girls...

662
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:11,505
Mom would scold you
for your big mouth!

663
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,351
No wonder you never married

664
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,108
...with such insolence!
- What?!

665
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:18,702
I am insolent?!
You loud mouth!

666
00:41:18,828 --> 00:41:20,100
I am a loud mouth?!

667
00:41:20,266 --> 00:41:21,095
<i>- Franjo!
- Come now...</i>

668
00:41:21,185 --> 00:41:24,969
Who do you think you are?
Primping all day long!

669
00:41:25,181 --> 00:41:27,976
- So what?!
- When did you dust last?

670
00:41:29,456 --> 00:41:32,013
Look! This shows
how much you're worth!

671
00:41:32,093 --> 00:41:32,570
Franjo!

672
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:36,125
You can't insult my wife!

673
00:41:36,289 --> 00:41:38,084
She's not much,
but you can't insult her!

674
00:41:38,247 --> 00:41:43,269
Thanks for the dinner!
You'll never see me again!

675
00:41:43,441 --> 00:41:44,350
Hooray!

676
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,276
- Godspeed!
- Thanks!

677
00:41:46,438 --> 00:41:48,551
I'd kill you if you were a man!

678
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:49,629
<i>Good-bye for ever!</i>

679
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:53,190
Peace at last.
She never has enough.

680
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,817
We won't get rid
of her that easily!

681
00:41:56,107 --> 00:41:58,460
My idea wasn't bad after all.

682
00:41:58,665 --> 00:42:01,096
- What idea?
- Her and Fulir.

683
00:42:01,302 --> 00:42:04,449
He's not married.
It can be arranged...

684
00:42:05,058 --> 00:42:07,410
- Stop babbling.
- Don't worry...

685
00:42:07,655 --> 00:42:09,052
We'll find him yet.

686
00:42:09,653 --> 00:42:11,482
I'm going over
to Šnidaršiæ's for a while.

687
00:42:26,355 --> 00:42:28,866
<i>Deep in the forest
leaves rustle</i>

688
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:33,066
<i>and flowers long
for sunlight's smile</i>

689
00:42:34,306 --> 00:42:37,375
<i>there I know a place
full of charm</i>

690
00:42:38,741 --> 00:42:41,014
<i>for me that's Paradise.</i>

691
00:42:42,577 --> 00:42:45,566
<i>There you will watch
with glee</i>

692
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:49,799
<i>sunshine coming through
to you</i>

693
00:42:50,209 --> 00:42:53,595
<i>touching your hair
with its gold</i>

694
00:42:54,684 --> 00:42:57,559
<i>while I sing to you...</i>

695
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:01,833
<i>Don't you know</i>

696
00:43:02,676 --> 00:43:03,471
<i>that I...</i>

697
00:43:03,595 --> 00:43:05,901
<i>... adore you</i>

698
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:09,820
<i>and that real love</i>

699
00:43:10,747 --> 00:43:13,338
<i>is bringing me to you?</i>

700
00:43:16,101 --> 00:43:17,851
<i>Don't you know</i>

701
00:43:18,858 --> 00:43:22,006
<i>that I love you dearly?</i>

702
00:43:23,253 --> 00:43:24,049
<i>Without you</i>

703
00:43:24,612 --> 00:43:26,282
<i>I can't sleep</i>

704
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:28,321
<i>I can't work</i>

705
00:43:28,887 --> 00:43:30,365
<i>I can't live</i>

706
00:43:30,885 --> 00:43:33,840
<i>so please be mine only!</i>

707
00:43:52,422 --> 00:43:55,297
I'm sorry Mr. Fulir wasn't here.

708
00:43:55,619 --> 00:43:57,732
- Why would he be?
- It just came to me.

709
00:43:58,336 --> 00:44:01,404
- Will he marry Auntie Mina?
- Hush, now!

710
00:44:01,612 --> 00:44:04,043
Next time don't eavesdrop.

711
00:44:05,648 --> 00:44:08,761
THURSDAY

712
00:44:09,803 --> 00:44:13,633
<i>Will he come
or will he not...</i>

713
00:44:13,799 --> 00:44:15,072
- Good day, miss!
- Hello!

714
00:44:15,637 --> 00:44:17,114
- Will there be pressing?
- Karlek!

715
00:44:17,275 --> 00:44:20,025
<i>He will come, or maybe not...</i>

716
00:44:21,111 --> 00:44:22,701
<i>- Karlek!
...I shall wait for him</i>

717
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:24,425
<i>until midnight...</i>

718
00:44:27,504 --> 00:44:30,095
We're going to the river.

719
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:33,212
- They've already made up?
- God knows!

720
00:44:33,538 --> 00:44:35,174
<i>That splendid night</i>

721
00:44:35,975 --> 00:44:40,646
<i>God meant for us to love</i>

722
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:41,799
<i>'cause</i>

723
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,679
<i>God up above</i>

724
00:44:45,525 --> 00:44:47,797
<i>knows everything</i>

725
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,147
<i>Dazzled are souls</i>

726
00:44:54,555 --> 00:44:56,748
<i>by the sea at night</i>

727
00:44:58,391 --> 00:45:01,504
<i>and sweet sweet love</i>

728
00:45:02,267 --> 00:45:06,141
<i>joins our hearts...</i>

729
00:45:06,542 --> 00:45:09,178
<i>Darling, tonight</i>

730
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:13,408
<i>I'll whisper sweet
words of love</i>

731
00:45:14,533 --> 00:45:17,170
<i>tonight I must tell you</i>

732
00:45:18,409 --> 00:45:19,080
<i>how much</i>

733
00:45:19,248 --> 00:45:21,396
<i>I love you...</i>

734
00:45:23,963 --> 00:45:25,156
Fulir! Fulir!

735
00:45:25,362 --> 00:45:26,634
- There's Fulir!
- Where?

736
00:45:33,193 --> 00:45:33,988
<i>Fulir!</i>

737
00:45:37,189 --> 00:45:38,098
Fulir!

738
00:45:44,221 --> 00:45:45,097
<i>Fulir!</i>

739
00:45:49,855 --> 00:45:51,048
- He's gone!
- Let's go!

740
00:45:51,174 --> 00:45:52,571
He disappeared!

741
00:46:05,998 --> 00:46:07,350
No, Daddy! No!

742
00:46:09,354 --> 00:46:10,229
No, Daddy!

743
00:46:11,432 --> 00:46:13,466
As if he was swallowed
by earth!

744
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:15,186
- You... the shower!
- No! No!

745
00:46:33,009 --> 00:46:34,884
Maybe he's mad at me.

746
00:46:35,366 --> 00:46:37,003
Shame I couldn't find him.

747
00:46:37,324 --> 00:46:39,313
We'd discuss that Manchuria
stuff in the news.

748
00:46:39,602 --> 00:46:41,829
It's quite vague, though.

749
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:44,824
- Let's go home!
- Wait, it's still early.

750
00:46:45,555 --> 00:46:48,067
- I'm bored!
- You just go ahead.

751
00:46:48,232 --> 00:46:50,585
I may still find him.

752
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:52,266
It's important for Mina...

753
00:46:56,024 --> 00:46:57,694
- Another one, please.
- Spritzer?

754
00:46:57,862 --> 00:46:59,180
Yes, does me good.

755
00:46:59,301 --> 00:47:00,096
Thank you.

756
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:10,157
<i>For half an hour?!</i>

757
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:12,720
- Robbery!
- Why?

758
00:47:13,006 --> 00:47:15,517
You'd sleep here, too?
This isn't a hotel!

759
00:47:16,362 --> 00:47:17,476
Whore!

760
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:18,995
Idiot...

761
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:20,195
Shut up!

762
00:47:22,396 --> 00:47:25,112
- Good evening, miss.
- Evening, Mr. Šafranek.

763
00:47:25,752 --> 00:47:28,582
- Wonderful moonlight.
- I'm watching it, too.

764
00:47:31,146 --> 00:47:32,180
Oh, yes...

765
00:47:34,343 --> 00:47:36,332
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Šafranek.

766
00:47:38,338 --> 00:47:40,804
Couldn't find him,
but all is not lost yet.

767
00:47:41,455 --> 00:47:44,330
<i>- OId drunkard!
- We only had one bottle.</i>

768
00:47:44,412 --> 00:47:47,923
Scout's honor. Discussed about
Manchuria and the Japanese.

769
00:47:48,008 --> 00:47:49,406
Honest!

770
00:47:52,124 --> 00:47:53,316
<i>Not interested, huh?</i>

771
00:47:54,042 --> 00:47:55,314
But I am!

772
00:47:55,919 --> 00:47:58,226
<i>There's oriental danger.</i>

773
00:47:58,477 --> 00:48:00,783
The Asians
will conquer the world!

774
00:48:00,874 --> 00:48:02,863
And you had to get drunk!

775
00:48:03,032 --> 00:48:04,509
<i>See? You don't understand me!</i>

776
00:48:06,148 --> 00:48:08,102
I'm not drunk at all.

777
00:48:09,065 --> 00:48:11,735
I can stand
on one leg forever!

778
00:48:11,862 --> 00:48:13,499
Enough babbling, come to bed!

779
00:48:19,095 --> 00:48:20,082
What is it?!

780
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:24,278
Don't get mad...

781
00:48:25,727 --> 00:48:27,875
Shame on you,
you'll wake the child.

782
00:48:30,322 --> 00:48:33,914
<i>Dad says a caterpillar turns
to a butterfly over night.</i>

783
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:35,352
<i>I can't wait...</i>

784
00:48:35,477 --> 00:48:39,466
<i>... to see it happen.
- Like two little doves...</i>

785
00:48:40,112 --> 00:48:41,941
<i>Drunk like a skunk!
Quiet!</i>

786
00:48:43,428 --> 00:48:45,303
FRIDAY

787
00:48:45,426 --> 00:48:46,335
<i>White sand!</i>

788
00:48:46,545 --> 00:48:49,454
White sand!

789
00:48:51,579 --> 00:48:53,568
White sand!

790
00:48:54,177 --> 00:48:56,244
<i>White sand!</i>

791
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:00,680
<i>Perica!</i>

792
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:04,125
<i>Let's eat!</i>

793
00:49:07,802 --> 00:49:09,313
Give me your plate.

794
00:49:11,598 --> 00:49:12,473
Let me...

795
00:49:18,471 --> 00:49:19,868
- Want some more?
- O. K.

796
00:49:20,309 --> 00:49:21,626
Here...

797
00:49:22,147 --> 00:49:23,658
<i>Ana, Franjo!</i>

798
00:49:24,584 --> 00:49:27,653
I was rushing so,
my heart will burst!

799
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,770
I'm not mad any more

800
00:49:29,938 --> 00:49:33,688
over that tiny misunderstanding.
Ana, look...

801
00:49:33,894 --> 00:49:37,200
How do you like my new dress?
Made it myself.

802
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:39,803
Mrs. Hundiæ just cut it.
Franjo...

803
00:49:40,207 --> 00:49:43,832
What do you say?
Nice, right?

804
00:49:44,602 --> 00:49:47,591
Carps? Wonderful...

805
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:50,385
Our house is always open,
but you can't lecture me...

806
00:49:50,476 --> 00:49:53,306
...about the dust.
- It was nothing.

807
00:49:53,433 --> 00:49:55,705
Dust comes fast.
Lemon?

808
00:49:56,310 --> 00:50:01,173
Guess who I saw today.
Mr. Fulir.

809
00:50:02,983 --> 00:50:04,778
And where?

810
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,890
He was going
into Hunter's Restaurant.

811
00:50:07,618 --> 00:50:09,493
He's so nice.

812
00:50:09,775 --> 00:50:11,287
A fine man.

813
00:50:13,092 --> 00:50:14,603
He said...

814
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:20,162
"Miss, this dress looks
wonderful on you." Honest!

815
00:50:21,163 --> 00:50:23,117
He said nothing else?

816
00:50:23,281 --> 00:50:26,667
Well, he mentioned a dispute
with Franjo. What was it?

817
00:50:26,877 --> 00:50:29,672
- I didn't say anything.
- You did! He's sensitive...

818
00:50:29,874 --> 00:50:33,146
...and you keep stinging him.
- You shouldn't have.

819
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:34,940
It's embarrassing.

820
00:50:35,148 --> 00:50:37,864
He's got to stop correcting me.

821
00:50:38,065 --> 00:50:40,371
Otherwise we're pals.

822
00:50:40,862 --> 00:50:44,646
You can't be right always.
He's clever and knows a lot.

823
00:50:44,897 --> 00:50:47,011
- And I'm stupid?
- God forbid!

824
00:50:47,215 --> 00:50:50,408
It only turned out
unpleasant. Pity...

825
00:50:50,651 --> 00:50:52,844
<i>There's a fair in
Maksimir Park on Sunday.</i>

826
00:50:53,128 --> 00:50:56,037
- You're going?
- What, alone?

827
00:50:56,605 --> 00:50:58,594
<i>Perhaps Mr. Fulir
will come after all.</i>

828
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:01,669
He won't, he's got pride!

829
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:05,505
Shame... it would be nice
if he came, right?

830
00:51:05,915 --> 00:51:06,949
<i>Right, Ana?</i>

831
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:12,587
Again you're not eating
What's that?

832
00:51:13,227 --> 00:51:14,783
- Nothing!
- Give it here!

833
00:51:17,822 --> 00:51:20,652
God! What will you
bring next!?!

834
00:51:21,098 --> 00:51:23,291
Go wash your hands, quickly!

835
00:51:27,092 --> 00:51:30,081
- So you saw him at Hunter's?
- Right!

836
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,194
- What?
- Nothing...

837
00:51:50,786 --> 00:51:54,253
<i>Like two little doves</i>

838
00:51:55,581 --> 00:52:00,127
<i>so happy we were</i>

839
00:52:02,094 --> 00:52:06,640
<i>from one little mug</i>

840
00:52:06,969 --> 00:52:10,355
<i>we used to</i>

841
00:52:10,565 --> 00:52:14,474
<i>drink there...</i>

842
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:18,512
I'll drink to that!

843
00:52:18,756 --> 00:52:19,949
Cheers!

844
00:52:23,191 --> 00:52:24,862
Two more spritzers!

845
00:52:25,029 --> 00:52:27,824
- More soda water for me.
- Excuse me?

846
00:52:28,346 --> 00:52:30,732
More soda water
for the gentleman!

847
00:52:30,903 --> 00:52:33,256
You deaf oaf!

848
00:52:35,858 --> 00:52:37,847
Well, while we're at it...

849
00:52:38,775 --> 00:52:42,446
...I've got something to tell you.
You know my wife, right?

850
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:47,235
The Lady is very nice.
A fine woman.

851
00:52:47,845 --> 00:52:51,231
I'm glad you like her.
But you know...

852
00:52:51,681 --> 00:52:54,987
...Mina is also a fine woman.
- Who?

853
00:52:55,197 --> 00:52:58,344
Mina, her sister.
You two have met.

854
00:52:58,553 --> 00:53:00,940
I've had the honor.

855
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:05,704
- Listen, she's quite wealthy.
- You don't say.

856
00:53:06,425 --> 00:53:09,414
Just between us...
Know how much she's got?

857
00:53:13,217 --> 00:53:14,649
Really?

858
00:53:16,134 --> 00:53:18,202
She sold her house and land.

859
00:53:18,492 --> 00:53:21,639
Thank God!
She'll marry easily.

860
00:53:21,808 --> 00:53:22,956
Right!

861
00:53:23,566 --> 00:53:24,634
Cheers!

862
00:53:24,805 --> 00:53:26,794
<i>Come on in, Fulir.</i>

863
00:53:27,962 --> 00:53:28,711
Watch your head.

864
00:53:32,357 --> 00:53:34,709
You did come!

865
00:53:35,194 --> 00:53:37,910
We made up for the insults,
at Šn idaršiæ's...

866
00:53:38,071 --> 00:53:40,298
...so we don't have to
bother you about it. Right?

867
00:53:40,468 --> 00:53:41,695
Of course!

868
00:53:41,946 --> 00:53:45,572
Perhaps madame has some
peppers? They'd do me good.

869
00:53:45,782 --> 00:53:48,248
Naturally!
I'll be right back.

870
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:52,614
- See if you have some food.
- I'm not here to eat.

871
00:53:53,414 --> 00:53:54,641
Madame, many thanks.

872
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:55,522
Perica...

873
00:53:56,211 --> 00:53:58,245
- Hello!
- Hi! Kitty-kitty...

874
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:11,867
Madame, many thanks.
It was wonderful.

875
00:54:13,712 --> 00:54:14,541
Delicious!

876
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:18,423
It's a shame you came late,
it was completely cold.

877
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:21,502
Really, the carps dish was...

878
00:54:21,664 --> 00:54:23,459
<i>...comme il faut.</i>

879
00:54:24,381 --> 00:54:27,449
I agree, the fish
was delicious!

880
00:54:28,376 --> 00:54:30,604
We have the same taste!

881
00:54:31,733 --> 00:54:34,403
Carps have to swim,
and you're not drinking!

882
00:54:39,205 --> 00:54:40,353
Miss...

883
00:54:42,122 --> 00:54:42,871
Cheers!

884
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:54,699
Come on, Fulir,
aren't we going to sing?

885
00:54:56,386 --> 00:54:59,534
I regret I can't today.
I have a sore throat.

886
00:54:59,823 --> 00:55:00,777
<i>Jesus and Maria!</i>

887
00:55:00,901 --> 00:55:02,015
<i>If only...</i>

888
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:03,935
...madame would sing.

889
00:55:04,697 --> 00:55:08,084
By request, I'll gladly
sing instead of you.

890
00:55:10,971 --> 00:55:12,482
But I don't know what...

891
00:55:12,888 --> 00:55:15,957
<i>- Ana, "Thank You".
- All right then.</i>

892
00:55:17,563 --> 00:55:19,756
<i>For each nice word from you</i>

893
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:24,509
<i>that you used to give me</i>

894
00:55:25,395 --> 00:55:27,781
<i>for ev'ry glance you sent</i>

895
00:55:28,991 --> 00:55:34,503
<i>for ev'ry smile I thank thee</i>

896
00:55:35,025 --> 00:55:38,218
<i>There's so little good</i>

897
00:55:38,581 --> 00:55:43,331
<i>in this life</i>

898
00:55:44,335 --> 00:55:48,323
<i>an instant of sunlight</i>

899
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:53,362
<i>is quickly changed by night</i>

900
00:55:54,604 --> 00:55:57,320
<i>And you gave my soul</i>

901
00:55:59,358 --> 00:56:03,983
<i>oh, so much sun</i>

902
00:56:05,831 --> 00:56:10,616
<i>So I can't but say</i>

903
00:56:12,225 --> 00:56:14,577
<i>a heartfelt</i>

904
00:56:15,781 --> 00:56:18,849
<i>thank you.</i>

905
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:22,092
It was so beautiful.

906
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,280
<i>- Right?
- If only...</i>

907
00:56:25,490 --> 00:56:28,160
...you wouldn't sing.
You're tone deaf!

908
00:56:28,367 --> 00:56:30,162
Don't be so rude!

909
00:56:31,164 --> 00:56:33,595
<i>How's your throat,
hurts a lot?</i>

910
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:39,630
To your health!
I hope you can drink!

911
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:43,821
- Look...
- What's that?

912
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:45,984
- A saber.
- You have a saber?

913
00:56:46,388 --> 00:56:49,138
Our fathers used them
against Turks!

914
00:56:49,504 --> 00:56:51,618
I remember!

915
00:56:52,181 --> 00:56:55,011
- Where are those times?
- Franjo...

916
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:57,485
You're really a nice guy!

917
00:56:57,855 --> 00:57:01,128
- Honesty shows in your eyes.
- Wonderfully said!

918
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:04,122
I'm honest,
but stand no insults.

919
00:57:04,328 --> 00:57:07,283
Can be meek as a lamb...

920
00:57:07,485 --> 00:57:10,360
...but mad as a lion!
Then I can tear a man apart!

921
00:57:10,522 --> 00:57:12,192
Franjo, don't!

922
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:15,547
Be a lion in your office.
Can't even ask for a raise...

923
00:57:15,756 --> 00:57:17,426
You understand nothing.

924
00:57:18,713 --> 00:57:20,905
Dad, give it to me!

925
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:25,617
Dear Fulir, the days
of knights are gone.

926
00:57:25,785 --> 00:57:27,978
I always  tegret
I didn't live back then.

927
00:57:28,822 --> 00:57:32,606
Want some peace? Raise
the drawbridge and kiss my ass!

928
00:57:32,938 --> 00:57:35,130
How can you say that?!

929
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:39,369
Modern life requires
different architecture.

930
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:42,839
Instead of towers,
concrete skyscrapers.

931
00:57:42,967 --> 00:57:45,194
Houses look like boxes!

932
00:57:45,524 --> 00:57:48,194
I wasn't born
to live in a box!

933
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,110
But it's nice to live
in a skyscraper.

934
00:57:52,357 --> 00:57:56,231
Lots of air and sun,
wonderful view.

935
00:57:56,752 --> 00:57:59,627
I used to live
on the 17th floor...

936
00:57:59,829 --> 00:58:02,624
...of a hotel in Milan.
- That high?!

937
00:58:02,905 --> 00:58:05,292
You've no idea how it is.

938
00:58:05,542 --> 00:58:07,531
Quit talking, let's drink!

939
00:58:08,499 --> 00:58:09,169
Cheers!

940
00:58:09,578 --> 00:58:12,487
Darned drinks! It's not
everything in life.

941
00:58:12,815 --> 00:58:15,406
One glass of wine
is not a crime!

942
00:58:15,691 --> 00:58:17,759
You're such a killjoy.

943
00:58:19,288 --> 00:58:22,879
Stop sighing, carp
isn't that indigestible.

944
00:58:23,283 --> 00:58:26,158
- It's not from food!
- The man's got feelings.

945
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,990
I do, too, but I'm not sighing.

946
00:58:29,277 --> 00:58:32,072
I'm made from iron!

947
00:58:32,873 --> 00:58:35,225
Perica, bring another bottle.

948
00:58:39,785 --> 00:58:41,660
Life is so sad...

949
00:58:43,941 --> 00:58:46,247
A man could hang himself
if it weren't for ideals...

950
00:58:46,418 --> 00:58:49,134
...shining before him
like the sun.

951
00:58:52,851 --> 00:58:54,919
It's hard for people
who live lonely.

952
00:58:57,087 --> 00:59:00,200
It's rather strange you stil...

953
00:59:00,443 --> 00:59:02,033
...haven't got married.

954
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,233
Oh, don't ask...

955
00:59:07,196 --> 00:59:11,389
One rarely meets a woman
he could adore.

956
00:59:11,671 --> 00:59:12,580
<i>But there are women...</i>

957
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:15,744
...worth falling in love with.

958
00:59:16,546 --> 00:59:19,103
Only they're modest...

959
00:59:19,623 --> 00:59:21,339
...and hard to notice.

960
00:59:22,499 --> 00:59:26,488
I'm sure you'll find
Miss Right.

961
00:59:28,333 --> 00:59:29,162
Yes...

962
00:59:29,572 --> 00:59:33,799
Yes, but rare are those
of true beauty and sublimity.

963
00:59:35,366 --> 00:59:37,241
I think so, too!

964
00:59:37,643 --> 00:59:39,791
Most important is what's inside!

965
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,032
<i>I haven't married...</i>

966
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:43,914
<i>... because men don't look...</i>

967
00:59:44,316 --> 00:59:45,509
...for heart and soul, only...

968
00:59:45,794 --> 00:59:47,748
<i>... skirts and legs!</i>

969
00:59:49,311 --> 00:59:49,787
<i>OK, Fulir...</i>

970
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:52,461
You could sing one in low voice.

971
00:59:52,667 --> 00:59:55,462
No offense,
but I have to leave you.

972
00:59:55,983 --> 00:59:57,733
- Why?
- Out of the question!

973
00:59:57,861 --> 00:59:59,656
The fun's just started!

974
00:59:59,819 --> 01:00:02,649
Sorry, I don't feel well.

975
01:00:02,856 --> 01:00:04,765
I'm afraid I'm... feverish.

976
01:00:04,974 --> 01:00:06,610
Really?

977
01:00:07,011 --> 01:00:09,920
It can be helped.
My wife can make some tea.

978
01:00:10,168 --> 01:00:12,122
- Gladly!
- No, no! Thank you kindly.

979
01:00:12,286 --> 01:00:14,638
But I can't stay.

980
01:00:15,083 --> 01:00:17,389
- Good-bye.
- I'll see you out.

981
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:19,594
Fulir, when will we
see you again?

982
01:00:19,838 --> 01:00:22,429
Perhaps at that fair?

983
01:00:22,635 --> 01:00:26,340
Thanks for re inding me. Come
with us to the fair on Sunday.

984
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:28,267
- I invite you.
- Mr. Fulir...

985
01:00:28,428 --> 01:00:34,258
- We'd really like you to come.
- Gladly, if I get well.

986
01:00:37,738 --> 01:00:38,886
Good-bye.

987
01:00:41,934 --> 01:00:44,445
Come to the fair, please!

988
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:48,916
It's getting along fine.
Did you see his glances?

989
01:00:49,566 --> 01:00:53,918
You really think something
could come out of it?

990
01:00:54,041 --> 01:00:56,075
What? It's in the bag!

991
01:00:56,398 --> 01:00:58,466
Only you should be more
active, too.

992
01:00:58,836 --> 01:01:00,153
But how?

993
01:01:00,394 --> 01:01:02,428
Do something,
you're a woman...

994
01:01:04,749 --> 01:01:05,658
Madame...

995
01:01:06,867 --> 01:01:09,503
Since I met you,
I've had no peace.

996
01:01:10,383 --> 01:01:12,337
I was thinking of you
all night last night.

997
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:15,173
At least someone...

998
01:01:15,617 --> 01:01:17,970
This is no life for you.

999
01:01:19,174 --> 01:01:21,049
You're a sophisticated soul.

1000
01:01:21,691 --> 01:01:24,122
You do understand me.
I suffer so much...

1001
01:01:26,326 --> 01:01:28,235
Perhaps you were
thinking of me?

1002
01:01:30,801 --> 01:01:32,279
I have to go inside.

1003
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:35,155
- When will I see you?
- I can't tell you now.

1004
01:01:35,556 --> 01:01:37,351
But you'll come again?

1005
01:01:38,872 --> 01:01:39,781
Certainly.

1006
01:01:40,551 --> 01:01:43,267
For you I'd do anything!

1007
01:01:45,305 --> 01:01:48,817
Good night.
Dream something nice.

1008
01:01:49,301 --> 01:01:50,415
You too.

1009
01:01:54,256 --> 01:01:56,290
Good night.

1010
01:01:57,652 --> 01:01:58,720
Good night.

1011
01:02:04,445 --> 01:02:06,434
- Good night, neighbor!
- Good night!

1012
01:02:11,957 --> 01:02:13,911
What's with that Fulir man?

1013
01:02:15,193 --> 01:02:16,988
I guess he can't drink.

1014
01:02:19,149 --> 01:02:20,819
Perhaps the wine was
too cold for him?

1015
01:02:21,786 --> 01:02:23,536
He could have said so.

1016
01:02:24,663 --> 01:02:27,697
He's emotional, and such
people are sensitive.

1017
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:30,013
Emotional! And I'm an ox?!

1018
01:02:30,617 --> 01:02:33,333
Don't get upset.
Lie down and sleep.

1019
01:02:35,691 --> 01:02:37,680
<i>I'm in love</i>

1020
01:02:38,049 --> 01:02:40,879
<i>'cause that is what
my heart desires...</i>

1021
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:48,835
I was just thinking
about Mina...

1022
01:02:51,994 --> 01:02:54,868
If she could only
find a husband.

1023
01:02:55,909 --> 01:02:57,738
A woman can't live
on her own.

1024
01:03:01,184 --> 01:03:05,092
You know... tonight they seemed
to start throwing glances.

1025
01:03:06,258 --> 01:03:07,053
Who did?

1026
01:03:07,697 --> 01:03:09,764
More of your nonsense!

1027
01:03:10,414 --> 01:03:14,721
Say what you like,
but I think it'll work.

1028
01:03:15,328 --> 01:03:17,476
You weren't Greta Garbo
when I married you either.

1029
01:03:18,205 --> 01:03:20,558
A man needs a home and
comfort, so he marries.

1030
01:03:21,242 --> 01:03:24,072
And Mina's got money...

1031
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:27,466
Not everybody is
interested in money.

1032
01:03:27,675 --> 01:03:31,186
You're so wrong.
Such people don't exist.

1033
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:41,094
Such is life...

1034
01:03:43,618 --> 01:03:46,732
SATURDAY

1035
01:03:48,173 --> 01:03:50,764
<i>I'm in love</i>

1036
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:53,647
<i>'cause love makes
our lives so fine</i>

1037
01:03:55,725 --> 01:03:58,156
<i>I'm in love</i>

1038
01:03:58,322 --> 01:04:01,436
<i>'cause that is what
my heart desires...</i>

1039
01:04:02,398 --> 01:04:06,069
<i>This morning Mom was merry,
singing all the time...</i>

1040
01:04:06,234 --> 01:04:08,143
<i>... that dull song "I'm in Love"...</i>

1041
01:04:08,431 --> 01:04:11,101
<i>... so I was able to play
with Dad's saber.</i>

1042
01:04:11,268 --> 01:04:12,824
Charge!

1043
01:04:39,278 --> 01:04:40,073
Charge!

1044
01:04:41,276 --> 01:04:42,627
You dumb oaf!

1045
01:04:42,874 --> 01:04:46,624
Charge!
Death to janissaries!

1046
01:04:47,389 --> 01:04:49,617
Lend me a dress
for tomorrow's fair.

1047
01:04:49,827 --> 01:04:52,497
- Will you?
- Don't touch!

1048
01:04:52,703 --> 01:04:55,772
- Don't know what to wear myself.
- This one isn't bad.

1049
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:59,685
I was just going
to try it out myself.

1050
01:05:01,934 --> 01:05:03,365
This one's not good?

1051
01:05:05,330 --> 01:05:07,523
My new one's not suitable...

1052
01:05:07,647 --> 01:05:09,476
...and the others are old.

1053
01:05:15,998 --> 01:05:16,873
<i>Once in a while...</i>

1054
01:05:16,997 --> 01:05:20,747
...you go out, and have
nothing to wear.

1055
01:05:21,872 --> 01:05:23,906
- What do you think?
- What?

1056
01:05:26,187 --> 01:05:29,221
I don't know... this one
was better.

1057
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:30,133
Think so?

1058
01:05:30,782 --> 01:05:34,737
I guess the neckline's too low.

1059
01:05:35,218 --> 01:05:37,729
The yellow one
goes well with your face.

1060
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:45,124
SUNDAY

1061
01:06:08,262 --> 01:06:10,978
Now I know who you
remind me of.

1062
01:06:11,139 --> 01:06:13,491
Saw a picture of a tennis
player in papers...

1063
01:06:13,616 --> 01:06:16,082
You remind me of him.

1064
01:06:16,293 --> 01:06:19,646
I used to play tennis a lot.
Here...

1065
01:06:20,169 --> 01:06:22,442
I may have a picture
with me...

1066
01:06:23,406 --> 01:06:26,678
What a fine sport.
Everybody in white...

1067
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:29,473
Like cooks! You just
stay in the kitchen!

1068
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:40,178
Beautiful music...

1069
01:06:41,107 --> 01:06:42,982
Dad, it's from "Zrinski"?

1070
01:06:43,504 --> 01:06:45,254
Probably some other opera.

1071
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:47,092
Jacques Offenbach's
"Hoffmann's Stories".

1072
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:50,533
<i>- Hoffmans Erzählungen.
- You know everything!</i>

1073
01:06:50,816 --> 01:06:54,521
Rubbish, no one
can know everything!

1074
01:06:55,012 --> 01:06:57,477
Don't get upset.
You're hypertonic,

1075
01:06:57,769 --> 01:07:01,075
yet you had four steaks!

1076
01:07:01,165 --> 01:07:02,483
See the result?

1077
01:07:03,003 --> 01:07:05,639
I upset?
Who's upset?

1078
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:08,152
I just said
no one can know everything...

1079
01:07:08,317 --> 01:07:10,670
<i>- ... whoever they may be.
- I'm not showing off.</i>

1080
01:07:10,835 --> 01:07:13,709
I've read a lot of books
and I do know a lot.

1081
01:07:14,511 --> 01:07:17,102
Must be wonderful to be so
sophisticated and educated.

1082
01:07:17,388 --> 01:07:20,581
- You can talk about everything.
- I read a book...

1083
01:07:20,704 --> 01:07:21,738
...on man's evolution.

1084
01:07:21,823 --> 01:07:22,618
<i>It says all.</i>

1085
01:07:22,742 --> 01:07:24,810
First there were fish...

1086
01:07:24,979 --> 01:07:27,332
...then they got legs.
Then there was man.

1087
01:07:27,696 --> 01:07:29,764
Not that Englishman's book...

1088
01:07:29,974 --> 01:07:32,929
...about us being apes first?
- Can't remember the writer...

1089
01:07:33,171 --> 01:07:36,443
...but it had a nice cover.

1090
01:07:37,126 --> 01:07:38,444
I heard it that way.

1091
01:07:39,044 --> 01:07:42,431
If he was an ape, O. K.
I certainly wasn't!

1092
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:45,517
- Right, Mr. Fulir?
- Certainly.

1093
01:07:45,957 --> 01:07:48,548
We share the same opinion
about everything!

1094
01:07:48,834 --> 01:07:50,311
You know zip about science!

1095
01:07:50,592 --> 01:07:52,262
No point in talking to you.

1096
01:07:54,428 --> 01:07:56,381
Excuse me... gotta go...

1097
01:07:56,665 --> 01:07:59,574
- Again!
- Yes, again. Thank God!

1098
01:08:07,573 --> 01:08:08,721
Ah, a waltz...

1099
01:08:09,891 --> 01:08:11,368
No, it's a tango.

1100
01:08:12,928 --> 01:08:14,518
It's a shame I can't dance.

1101
01:08:15,365 --> 01:08:17,638
I hope madame can.

1102
01:08:17,922 --> 01:08:19,036
But of course!

1103
01:08:22,597 --> 01:08:23,870
May I ask?

1104
01:08:34,984 --> 01:08:39,052
If you won't eat this,
I will. Shame to waste it.

1105
01:08:44,534 --> 01:08:46,999
<i>Darling, tonight</i>

1106
01:08:47,171 --> 01:08:50,523
<i>I'll whisper sweet
words of love</i>

1107
01:08:52,485 --> 01:08:55,315
<i>tonight I must tell you</i>

1108
01:08:56,001 --> 01:08:58,308
<i>how much I love you...</i>

1109
01:09:04,232 --> 01:09:07,027
I can't bear to be
without you any longer.

1110
01:09:09,027 --> 01:09:10,697
When shall we meet
in private?

1111
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:18,855
<i>Dazzled are souls</i>

1112
01:09:20,934 --> 01:09:23,366
<i>by the sea at night</i>

1113
01:09:24,171 --> 01:09:26,728
<i>and sweet sweet love</i>

1114
01:09:28,127 --> 01:09:30,592
<i>joins our hearts...</i>

1115
01:09:56,576 --> 01:09:59,007
Perica wouldn't eat, so I did.

1116
01:09:59,213 --> 01:10:01,167
Shame to waste it.
Right, honey?

1117
01:10:01,611 --> 01:10:03,803
You and Franjo would be
a perfect couple: You eat...

1118
01:10:03,928 --> 01:10:05,598
...he drinks.
You'd get along just fine!

1119
01:10:05,806 --> 01:10:09,192
Enough of your
criticism about food!

1120
01:10:09,362 --> 01:10:12,873
- I'm scared to eat!
- Calm down, will you?

1121
01:10:13,318 --> 01:10:14,466
It was just an expression.

1122
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:17,143
I know why you do this!

1123
01:10:18,872 --> 01:10:21,827
What do you know?
Let's hear!

1124
01:10:22,268 --> 01:10:23,904
I know what I know!

1125
01:10:24,426 --> 01:10:27,653
Thank God I hate to quarrel!

1126
01:10:28,382 --> 01:10:29,449
Rubbish!

1127
01:10:30,939 --> 01:10:33,655
Pretty women should never
quarrel.

1128
01:10:34,215 --> 01:10:36,965
They're here
to embellish life.

1129
01:10:37,332 --> 01:10:38,605
<i>You're right.</i>

1130
01:10:39,370 --> 01:10:41,359
You're a true gentleman.

1131
01:10:43,286 --> 01:10:44,842
My pleasure.

1132
01:11:01,146 --> 01:11:02,544
What wonderful weather.

1133
01:11:03,184 --> 01:11:04,138
Right?

1134
01:11:04,902 --> 01:11:07,130
It sure is... wonderful.

1135
01:11:10,936 --> 01:11:11,890
<i>You are, Milka,</i>

1136
01:11:12,015 --> 01:11:15,889
<i>mine, mine!
You are, Milka, mine, mine</i>

1137
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:18,084
<i>you are, Milka, mine, mine</i>

1138
01:11:18,208 --> 01:11:21,833
<i>I am yours!</i>

1139
01:11:21,924 --> 01:11:22,639
What?!

1140
01:11:23,722 --> 01:11:25,472
- Your pants...
- What about them?

1141
01:11:27,478 --> 01:11:28,705
<i>You're shop is open!</i>

1142
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:31,864
So what? The keeper's in!

1143
01:11:33,511 --> 01:11:34,579
Happens sometimes...

1144
01:11:35,150 --> 01:11:37,377
You and your stupid jokes!

1145
01:11:40,344 --> 01:11:42,173
Fulir, you're quite
a nice man.

1146
01:11:42,622 --> 01:11:44,814
Let's become
bosom brothers!

1147
01:11:45,099 --> 01:11:47,372
- Where's your glass?
- Not too much.

1148
01:11:47,776 --> 01:11:50,004
Come on... get up!

1149
01:11:50,613 --> 01:11:51,727
Give me your hand...

1150
01:11:52,491 --> 01:11:55,161
Bottoms up!
One... two...

1151
01:12:01,681 --> 01:12:03,317
Now let's kiss.

1152
01:12:13,748 --> 01:12:15,180
Silence! Silence!

1153
01:12:19,582 --> 01:12:21,571
Our dear friend Fulir.

1154
01:12:22,898 --> 01:12:25,728
- Our dear Ernest!
- To your health!

1155
01:12:26,295 --> 01:12:27,612
Mina, you'll get drunk.

1156
01:12:29,491 --> 01:12:30,889
That very first moment...

1157
01:12:31,129 --> 01:12:32,800
...the two of us met...

1158
01:12:33,647 --> 01:12:37,635
...I felt right then in my
chest my heart whispering...

1159
01:12:37,762 --> 01:12:41,035
"That's our guy..."

1160
01:12:41,398 --> 01:12:42,113
Right!

1161
01:12:42,717 --> 01:12:45,228
"The guy we can...

1162
01:12:45,833 --> 01:12:47,981
<i>... proudly embrace...</i>

1163
01:12:48,391 --> 01:12:51,663
<i>... since we tend
toward mutual ideals!"</i>

1164
01:12:51,907 --> 01:12:52,702
<i>What is it with you?</i>

1165
01:12:52,866 --> 01:12:54,263
Why are you so sour today?

1166
01:12:55,503 --> 01:12:57,378
Bravo, Franjo!
Wonderful speech.

1167
01:12:58,740 --> 01:12:59,807
<i>- Bravo!
- Wait...</i>

1168
01:13:00,098 --> 01:13:01,927
I'm not done yet.

1169
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:04,972
It's my pleasure to say
on behalf of us all...

1170
01:13:06,451 --> 01:13:07,246
Go ahead.

1171
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:09,923
Our dear Ernest, welcome!

1172
01:13:10,367 --> 01:13:11,401
- Cheers!
- Not yet!

1173
01:13:12,245 --> 01:13:14,710
I'm also glad to welcome you...

1174
01:13:14,802 --> 01:13:18,473
to our family. Cheers!

1175
01:13:18,638 --> 01:13:20,513
- Cheers! Cheers!
- Now you can drink!

1176
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:25,144
Wonderful speech.
You should be the Mayor!

1177
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:28,259
Miss... madame...

1178
01:13:28,587 --> 01:13:30,735
We shall not perish
with such people.

1179
01:13:31,225 --> 01:13:33,100
This should go to the papers!

1180
01:13:34,022 --> 01:13:36,294
Perica, go and play.

1181
01:13:36,419 --> 01:13:38,850
We have to discuss something.

1182
01:13:43,931 --> 01:13:45,442
Well, Fulir... pardon...

1183
01:13:45,729 --> 01:13:46,478
...Ernest...

1184
01:13:47,207 --> 01:13:48,878
It's OK.

1185
01:13:49,125 --> 01:13:51,795
Let's talk openly.
I'd like to know...

1186
01:13:52,202 --> 01:13:54,236
...your real intentions.

1187
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,877
What intentions?

1188
01:13:57,836 --> 01:14:01,108
Don't play dumb,
I have a good nose.

1189
01:14:01,392 --> 01:14:05,267
I see something is
cooking here. Well?

1190
01:14:05,867 --> 01:14:07,140
What is it all about?

1191
01:14:08,265 --> 01:14:11,651
I'd say you're a bit tipsy.

1192
01:14:11,781 --> 01:14:14,167
- I think so, too.
- I'm not talking to you!

1193
01:14:14,458 --> 01:14:17,413
And it's serious business.
Right, Ernest?

1194
01:14:18,094 --> 01:14:19,367
We understand each other.

1195
01:14:19,812 --> 01:14:23,926
What are your intentions
regarding our Mina?

1196
01:14:24,727 --> 01:14:26,920
What are you talking about?

1197
01:14:27,044 --> 01:14:29,317
He's just kidding!

1198
01:14:29,921 --> 01:14:31,875
Your rubbish again!

1199
01:14:32,918 --> 01:14:34,907
Excuse me,
I don't quite understand.

1200
01:14:35,355 --> 01:14:38,867
What an actor!
Almost fooled me...

1201
01:14:39,071 --> 01:14:42,538
- Don't. I'm really embarrassed!
- Why?

1202
01:14:42,827 --> 01:14:45,464
We're family!
Listen, Egon...

1203
01:14:45,584 --> 01:14:47,573
I find her
a real good match!

1204
01:14:47,702 --> 01:14:50,975
Young she ain't,
but she's holding out!

1205
01:14:51,138 --> 01:14:53,092
- What are you saying?!
- Don't get mad...

1206
01:14:53,256 --> 01:14:56,006
...but it's true.
You could use some money...

1207
01:14:56,133 --> 01:14:57,451
<i>... to open that shop.</i>

1208
01:14:57,651 --> 01:14:59,844
I beg you, don't!

1209
01:15:00,009 --> 01:15:02,315
- I beg you!
- Why?!

1210
01:15:02,446 --> 01:15:05,435
- We've discussed it!
- You've ruined everything!

1211
01:15:05,962 --> 01:15:08,155
Why?

1212
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:13,070
I'm so embarrassed!
I feel awful!

1213
01:15:13,315 --> 01:15:17,223
You stupid moron!
You've ruined everything!

1214
01:15:17,390 --> 01:15:21,095
Wait, don't go!

1215
01:15:21,785 --> 01:15:22,853
Stop, will you?

1216
01:15:29,497 --> 01:15:30,849
Women's frills...

1217
01:15:32,014 --> 01:15:34,003
Listen, she's still shy...

1218
01:15:34,851 --> 01:15:35,805
It'll pass.

1219
01:15:36,529 --> 01:15:39,359
You drunken ox!
You ruin every bit of fun!

1220
01:15:39,886 --> 01:15:40,761
Shut up!

1221
01:15:42,283 --> 01:15:45,750
Let's sing a tune!
You know what they say...

1222
01:15:46,039 --> 01:15:47,709
One song a day
keeps mischief away!

1223
01:15:51,074 --> 01:15:54,029
<i>Like two little doves...</i>

1224
01:15:54,630 --> 01:15:56,982
Give me a plane, I'll go
straight to Abyssinia!

1225
01:15:57,067 --> 01:15:58,545
Calm down!

1226
01:15:58,626 --> 01:16:00,773
- You embarrass me!
- You never understand me!

1227
01:16:00,903 --> 01:16:03,937
Fulir, you're a happy man
no one's pestering you!

1228
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:06,293
Sure, Franjo, I can
understand you quite well.

1229
01:16:08,135 --> 01:16:10,727
<i>See it watching us?</i>

1230
01:16:10,852 --> 01:16:11,329
<i>Get lost!</i>

1231
01:16:12,531 --> 01:16:13,803
Leave me alone!

1232
01:16:14,928 --> 01:16:15,598
Come!

1233
01:16:15,687 --> 01:16:17,721
Come down, if you dare!

1234
01:16:18,045 --> 01:16:21,351
<i>You think you're special
'cause you're of silver?!</i>

1235
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:25,036
Lie down while madame
prepares supper.

1236
01:16:25,517 --> 01:16:28,823
I'm fed up with my office
so I like to relax...

1237
01:16:29,033 --> 01:16:31,749
...but she doesn't understand.

1238
01:16:32,070 --> 01:16:33,740
Some rest will do you good.

1239
01:16:33,988 --> 01:16:36,260
You know,
you're a nice guy.

1240
01:16:36,545 --> 01:16:39,817
We couldn't have found
a better one!

1241
01:16:40,301 --> 01:16:41,937
<i>Get some rest, Franjo...</i>

1242
01:16:43,377 --> 01:16:44,093
Perica...

1243
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:51,599
He's asleep.

1244
01:16:56,084 --> 01:17:00,789
Would you bring us
a bottle of wine?

1245
01:17:01,718 --> 01:17:02,990
Here...

1246
01:17:03,236 --> 01:17:05,429
- Can I take the saber?
- Sure you can.

1247
01:17:05,633 --> 01:17:06,508
Charge!

1248
01:17:27,929 --> 01:17:30,202
<i>Darling, tonight</i>

1249
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:35,669
<i>I'll whisper sweet
words of love</i>

1250
01:17:35,961 --> 01:17:38,791
<i>tonight I shall tell you</i>

1251
01:17:39,916 --> 01:17:43,746
<i>how much I love you...</i>

1252
01:17:44,312 --> 01:17:46,664
<i>This splendid night</i>

1253
01:17:47,269 --> 01:17:51,303
<i>God meant for us to love</i>

1254
01:17:53,981 --> 01:17:57,015
<i>'cause God up above</i>

1255
01:17:58,776 --> 01:18:01,606
<i>knows everything...</i>

1256
01:18:03,291 --> 01:18:06,166
- What are you doing?!
- Kissing you!

1257
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:09,243
I never thought
you'd be so bad...

1258
01:18:10,484 --> 01:18:12,870
<i>Darling, tonight</i>

1259
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,152
<i>I'll whisper sweet</i>

1260
01:18:15,638 --> 01:18:18,308
<i>words of love</i>

1261
01:18:19,754 --> 01:18:22,981
<i>tonight I must tell you</i>

1262
01:18:23,989 --> 01:18:26,819
<i>how much I love you...</i>

1263
01:18:29,343 --> 01:18:31,297
What will you think of me?

1264
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:34,211
Charge!

1265
01:18:34,897 --> 01:18:36,613
<i>You scoundrel!</i>

1266
01:18:37,095 --> 01:18:39,084
<i>- Franjo, don't!
- Sure I will?!</i>

1267
01:18:39,332 --> 01:18:40,525
<i>Where's my saber?!</i>

1268
01:18:40,611 --> 01:18:42,565
- What's going on?!
- They're fighting!

1269
01:18:43,128 --> 01:18:44,116
<i>You swine!</i>

1270
01:18:44,287 --> 01:18:46,116
I'd strangle you
if it were legal!

1271
01:18:49,521 --> 01:18:50,669
- You bastard!
- Wait, Franjo...

1272
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:52,147
Let me explain!

1273
01:18:52,358 --> 01:18:54,916
I close my eyes,
and you're on her!

1274
01:19:02,028 --> 01:19:03,142
Franjo! Franjo, wait!

1275
01:19:03,426 --> 01:19:04,222
Franjo!

1276
01:19:04,985 --> 01:19:06,655
<i>Like two little doves...</i>

1277
01:19:07,422 --> 01:19:09,809
You scoundrel!
You're dead!

1278
01:19:17,212 --> 01:19:19,200
I'll show you!
Where's the saber?!

1279
01:19:19,689 --> 01:19:20,882
- Here, Daddy!
- Give it to me!

1280
01:19:50,696 --> 01:19:52,047
<i>- Is he gone?
- Yes.</i>

1281
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:55,760
<i>He's really gone?
Perica, you say.</i>

1282
01:20:13,391 --> 01:20:15,664
- Quite a new experience...
- For me, too!

1283
01:20:15,868 --> 01:20:17,220
I'm not talking to you!

1284
01:20:17,906 --> 01:20:20,895
You, a married wife,
letting him touch you.

1285
01:20:21,143 --> 01:20:23,290
- In my own house!
- I was resisting!

1286
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:25,574
Didn't look like it!

1287
01:20:25,818 --> 01:20:28,010
Don't come near me!
It's over between us!

1288
01:20:28,375 --> 01:20:29,806
- Daddy...
- Don't you "daddy" me!

1289
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:33,799
I won't divorce you
because of the child!

1290
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:35,246
Get out of my sight!

1291
01:20:44,038 --> 01:20:45,754
Dad, I brought wine.

1292
01:20:53,588 --> 01:20:57,099
Perica, you love me, right?

1293
01:20:59,541 --> 01:21:02,974
People are swine. Never
open your heart to anyone.

1294
01:21:03,537 --> 01:21:07,606
I won't. But may I play
with your saber tomorrow?

1295
01:21:09,011 --> 01:21:11,398
You little twit...
Go to sleep.

1296
01:21:11,928 --> 01:21:13,484
I want to be alone.

1297
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:24,150
No one knows how I
feel here... inside.

1298
01:21:25,433 --> 01:21:26,751
Dam ned Fulir!

1299
01:21:28,510 --> 01:21:30,339
I'll get you yet...

1300
01:21:33,425 --> 01:21:36,493
MONDAY

1301
01:22:20,214 --> 01:22:22,601
Don't cook for me.
Fr om now on I'm dead!

1302
01:22:22,812 --> 01:22:24,368
I'll eat at Znidaršiæ's.

1303
01:22:40,592 --> 01:22:42,626
- Good afternoon!
- Good afternoon, Mr. Šafranek.

1304
01:23:09,641 --> 01:23:12,596
<i>My little wife
is a migratory bird</i>

1305
01:23:13,157 --> 01:23:15,987
<i>often changes homes</i>

1306
01:23:16,673 --> 01:23:19,742
<i>first kissing one,
embracing two</i>

1307
01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:23,020
<i>then deeply in love</i>

1308
01:23:23,866 --> 01:23:27,172
<i>people are whispering
that I am a cuckold</i>

1309
01:23:27,742 --> 01:23:30,173
<i>and that she's the boss</i>

1310
01:23:31,418 --> 01:23:32,895
<i>But she's just saying...</i>

1311
01:23:33,176 --> 01:23:37,323
<i>"Love your fel ow-man,
those are words of God!"</i>

1312
01:23:38,330 --> 01:23:41,524
<i>In a little grove</i>

1313
01:23:42,126 --> 01:23:44,796
<i>a cuckoo 'cuckolds'</i>

1314
01:23:46,721 --> 01:23:48,596
<i>to be without a lover</i>

1315
01:23:49,718 --> 01:23:51,945
<i>is worst of all</i>

1316
01:23:53,434 --> 01:23:56,264
<i>your fella' may be dumb</i>

1320
01:24:03,982 --> 01:24:07,130
<i>let him in!</i>

1321
01:24:18,767 --> 01:24:21,358
<i>Yes?
A moment, I'm changing!</i>

1322
01:24:21,923 --> 01:24:24,310
- Let me go with you.
- You've no business here.

1323
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,594
Tell Mom we're even now!

1324
01:24:26,678 --> 01:24:27,314
OK.

1325
01:24:32,592 --> 01:24:35,057
God, Mr. Šafranek!
Come on in...

1326
01:24:40,223 --> 01:24:42,177
Do come in.

1327
01:24:47,775 --> 01:24:49,412
Excuse me, we don't know
each other.

1328
01:24:49,533 --> 01:24:52,204
Well, we do, but we haven't been
formally introduced.

1329
01:24:52,410 --> 01:24:54,968
- Šafranek.
- Pleased to meet you. Marijana.

1330
01:24:55,607 --> 01:24:58,038
- Well?
- It's a bit complicated...

1331
01:24:58,324 --> 01:25:01,630
- May I sit down?
- Of course!

1332
01:25:06,595 --> 01:25:08,981
No offense, but I'd like you...

1333
01:25:09,592 --> 01:25:12,057
...to shut the window
and pull down the blinds.

1334
01:25:12,389 --> 01:25:15,536
- As usual.
- And why?

1335
01:25:15,745 --> 01:25:17,699
Please, do it as a favor.

1336
01:25:17,863 --> 01:25:21,772
I'll pay whatever it costs,
I respect your price.

1337
01:25:22,778 --> 01:25:23,527
Alright...

1338
01:25:27,692 --> 01:25:30,362
Excuse me, but it's
a little embarrassing.

1339
01:25:30,649 --> 01:25:33,240
What would Mrs. say?

1340
01:25:33,566 --> 01:25:36,361
Don't you worry about that.

1341
01:25:36,563 --> 01:25:38,472
That's precisely the point.

1342
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:40,788
Just pull down the blinds.

1343
01:25:48,390 --> 01:25:49,867
Old devil!

1344
01:25:54,144 --> 01:25:56,416
I don't know the custom.
How much is it?

1345
01:25:57,980 --> 01:25:59,491
It depends...

1346
01:25:59,778 --> 01:26:01,891
Is 50 enough...

1347
01:26:02,095 --> 01:26:05,686
...for half an hour?
- That's too much!

1348
01:26:05,891 --> 01:26:07,845
I'm not stingy.

1349
01:26:09,447 --> 01:26:10,879
Here you are, thank you.

1350
01:26:20,196 --> 01:26:22,912
If you have some business
to attend to, go ahead.

1351
01:26:23,073 --> 01:26:24,982
I'll wait here quietly.

1352
01:26:26,749 --> 01:26:27,578
You're laughing...

1353
01:26:27,867 --> 01:26:29,140
Well, listen...

1354
01:26:29,386 --> 01:26:31,943
...since you have paid...

1355
01:26:32,422 --> 01:26:34,173
My respects to you.

1356
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:37,530
But no, thanks. It's just
revenge on my wife.

1357
01:26:41,213 --> 01:26:42,122
Franjo!

1358
01:26:43,011 --> 01:26:45,125
Come out this minute!
Shame on you!

1359
01:26:45,648 --> 01:26:48,080
Who are you, madam?
I don't know you.

1360
01:26:49,764 --> 01:26:51,956
You know very well who!
Come out!

1361
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:53,590
<i>Are you...</i>

1362
01:26:53,759 --> 01:26:56,476
...Mrs. Fulir?
Tell your husband...

1363
01:26:56,636 --> 01:26:59,352
...I'll smash his head
on his name day!

1364
01:27:01,431 --> 01:27:02,579
Get out of there!

1365
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:04,067
The scoundrel's not worth it!

1366
01:27:05,587 --> 01:27:06,735
There she is... the sow!

1367
01:27:08,464 --> 01:27:10,134
There he is, too!

1368
01:27:12,939 --> 01:27:15,609
What a disgrace!

1369
01:27:19,612 --> 01:27:22,725
HOW DAD ARRANGED IT ALL

1370
01:27:22,848 --> 01:27:25,598
<i>Yesterday Dad went to
Znidaršiæ's to talk...</i>

1371
01:27:25,845 --> 01:27:27,754
<i>... about the League
of Nations and disarmament.</i>

1372
01:27:28,043 --> 01:27:29,554
<i>But there happened
an important thing.</i>

1373
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,193
<i>Mr. Fulir came.</i>

1374
01:27:31,599 --> 01:27:34,394
<i>He explained everything
to Dad...</i>

1375
01:27:34,595 --> 01:27:37,584
<i>... so they kissed
and made up again.</i>

1376
01:27:38,351 --> 01:27:39,988
<i>What happened next,
I don't know...</i>

1377
01:27:40,110 --> 01:27:45,178
<i>... therefore I can't write
about it. It would be a Iie!</i>

1378
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:28,948
THE END
