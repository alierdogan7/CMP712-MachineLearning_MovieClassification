00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,190
"Residents of Jinsy,
stand by your tessellators"

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:11,090
"Now is the time to sing, sing, sing! "

3
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,270
"Daily greet."

4
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:53,660
This address goes out to all 792 residents

5
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,100
of our island that we doth calleth Jinsy.

6
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,530
791, sir. Mrs Feek just died.

7
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,940
I, Arbiter Maven,

8
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:10,060
hereby announce the 129th wedding lottery

9
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,740
by order of our noble leader,

10
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,430
The Great He, Jinsy Praise Him.

11
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,140
Jinsy Praise Him. Praise Him.

12
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,090
Put the film on, Sporall.

13
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,360
It's wedding lottery time again on Jinsy.

14
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:35,020
"Place your belongings in
the gender crates provided."

15
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,460
"Say goodbye to your
current partner."

16
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,690
Goodbye. Goodbye.

17
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:42,120
"On wedding lottery day,
Mr Slightlyman, master of balls,

18
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,810
will use the latest
faceball technology

19
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,980
to randomly select
your new breed pair."

20
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:53,110
"Then it's off to your new chalet
for the next three happy cycles."

21
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:04,130
"Remember to take your faceballs
to the Wedding Barn by..."

22
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,320
You know, Sporall,
forcing strangers to marry

23
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,250
really is one of the
island's finest traditions.

24
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,220
Along with nose hurling, sir.

25
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,520
Oh, I forgot to mention. The Great He,
Jinsy Praise Him... Praise Him.

26
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,470
..thought it would be good for
PR if one of US got married.

27
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,900
Congratulations, sir.
I'll get you a present.

28
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,830
Of course, being an arbiter,
I'm immune from this marital bingo.

29
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,740
You're not thinking about putting
me in the wedding lottery? No, no.

30
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,690
Not thinking. I already have.

31
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:41,570
Don't look so shocked, Sporall.
You might end up with Miss Jinsy.

32
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,790
She's quite a catch.

33
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,170
"Attention, all residents."

34
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:52,080
"Due to an influx of electric
owls across the island,

35
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,270
residents are instructed not to leave
their chalets after lights out."

36
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:59,930
"When startled, the owls emit
a reflex-action photocopy

37
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,840
in either A4 or A5,
depending on the age of the bird."

38
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,530
"At 6 and 3 gov clock last night,

39
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,230
Br Bray-o was nearly blinded

40
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,440
when an electric owl
clung to his head

41
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,650
and photocopied his
face repeatedly."

42
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,340
"If this happens to you,

43
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,020
contact Jerry from Printi-Printi

44
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,950
who will try to prize
the creature off."

45
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,160
"Or at least change
the cartridge."

46
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,280
I'm trying to work.

47
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,220
That's a carrot.

48
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,640
I wonder who you'll end up with.

49
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,810
What? In the wedding lottery. Oh.

50
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,780
Cyril Hench, the accurate groper.

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,460
Wet-nose Pete.

52
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,690
Dingly-dangly Darren.

53
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:49,580
Sporall, when you speak,
it's like words committing suicide.

54
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,780
Thanks. There goes another one.

55
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,720
"Arghhhhh!" Pffff!

56
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,150
Anyway, I know the man I want.

57
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,080
He's got curly hair, a big nose

58
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,510
and claps twice
when he enters a room.

59
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,420
Isn't she wonderful! I could almost...

60
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,040
The new version-four tessellator.

61
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,250
I'm going to wire one
up in the Wedding Barn

62
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,660
so the island can watch you in full...
medium definition.

63
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,830
Move away. Splendid, splendid!

64
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,780
Oh, is the screen touch-sensitive?

65
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,730
I'm wiping your spit off.

66
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,140
Do I really have to get married?

67
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,070
I'm used to my little routine at home.

68
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,430
Yes. It's decided.
Here's your faceball.

69
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,090
Let's have a quick word with Mrs Goadion.

70
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:52,220
Yes, I've suffered from
terrible wind all my life.

71
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,620
I wouldn't mind, but every time
it happens, it sounds remarkably

72
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,270
like the first three notes
of the Jinsy national anthem.

73
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:06,650
Really? Everybody in the room
stands up and starts singing.

74
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,860
Hang on. Yes?

75
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,780
Mrs Goadion, have you washed
my ceremonial leotard?

76
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,870
I think she must have done it on the
wrong temperature. No, it's perfect.

77
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:24,020
What man would not be moved to tears
to slip into this robe of office?

78
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,950
Showing off his full
credentials to the island?

79
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:36,020
Hello. And welcome to Punishment
Roundup for Twosday 24th.

80
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,880
First of all, Mr Cooshay,
chalet 156.

81
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,790
At 4 to 6 gov clock,
he did cut hedges at Druid Field

82
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:49,460
and left brambles and messy
cuttings in the lane.

83
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,150
So that's not good.

84
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:56,330
- Punishment
- suspension of dance vouchers for 23 nights

85
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,030
and a mild electrical.

86
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,260
Fire.

87
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,500
Call that a performance?
You're washed up. You're history.

88
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,180
I'll make sure you never
work in this industry again.

89
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,840
Oh, and, Tomelia, wipe your nose.

90
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:24,220
Go on, get out of here.
I can't bear to look at you.

91
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,380
Cheer up, Sporall.
It's only marriage.

92
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:32,520
Alright, you lose your freedom,
your personal space, half your income...

93
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,230
Daily greet. Daily greet.

94
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,160
Oh, Arbiter Maven!

95
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,330
I didn't recognise you. You look so old.

96
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,040
Like a spider's done webs on your face.

97
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,210
You should try Winkleman's Prink Parlour.

98
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:51,360
Seriously, lip clips, refreckles,
nosebenders, tummy tailers.

99
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,790
They can reduce your joofers.
Oh, look at that.

100
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,980
See these eyelids here?
You see them? Do you?

101
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,170
They're made from my earlobes. Seriously.

102
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,360
If I close my eyes like this,
I can't hear a thing.

103
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,790
Can we just get on
with the rehearsal?

104
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,940
See? Nothing. Shall we get
on with the rehearsal?

105
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,100
Now this is the button you need to press.
Dressing room's through here.

106
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,010
Has this been sanitised? Sporall,
remind me to bring my wipes.

107
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,220
Cooee! I'm waiting.
Come on, old man.

108
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,590
Oh, the swan of wedlock.
Bring it in, bring it in.

109
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,780
Right, let the old man through.

110
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,970
Goodbye.

111
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,420
What an awful person. Lovely skin, though.

112
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,780
See you! Bye-bye.

113
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,210
How's he made so much money?

114
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,460
Bare-knuckle boxing?

115
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,790
Oh, God, that hurts my throat.

116
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:18,720
I'm glad you say that,
because no one ever mentions that.

117
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,170
Even a little one hurts.

118
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,110
What you up after lunch?

119
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:27,020
I might go to the corrugated
roof and run along it.

120
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,960
I really like the tippy-tippy noise
my feet make. I might do that.

121
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,890
Not interested in a
round of golf, then?

122
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,580
No. I've never been good at golf.

123
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,010
Oh, what's your handicap?
I haven't got any arms, for a start.

124
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,500
Ah, Mr Maven. I've brought
the wedding paperwork

125
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,950
up from the law caves
for you to sign.

126
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,900
Stay on the mat. You're dripping!

127
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,850
How are things in the law caves,
Trince? Pretty damp.

128
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,020
My new desk is directly under a stalactite.

129
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,930
It drips. I suppose you're
looking forward to the lottery.

130
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,600
Probably pleased to get rid of your
current wife. Show him the picture.

131
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:16,220
She's a good cook.
Couldn't you get takeaways?

132
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,410
Get back on the mat!

133
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,620
Of course, one will never know

134
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,540
the enforced intimacies
of the marital lottery.

135
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,510
I mean, it's a wonderful system.

136
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,680
It's just a great shame
arbiters can't take part.

137
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,340
Trince, wasn't Arbiter Jenkins married?
That rings a bell.

138
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,770
Arbiter Jenkins... Hm, I'll look into that.

139
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,260
Sparky! Sparky?

140
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,230
Sparky!

141
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,780
Arbiter Maven, you really do
have a very full head of hair.

142
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,220
Unfortunately,

143
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,190
it's on my desk.

144
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,100
I just need temporary tightening, really.

145
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,070
Especially my cockerel shaker.

146
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,000
What I'm going to do is
take a piece of your buttock

147
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,700
and I'm going to put it here.

148
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,140
It's not part of the procedure.
It's just for a bit of fun. Oh...

149
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,840
I'll pop it back later.

150
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,530
Oh, do you want me to reduce your joofers?

151
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,500
Um... Yes, alright.

152
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,200
Course you do.

153
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,420
Oh!

154
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,840
Argh!

155
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,540
"Now a quick look at recent deaths

Daily greet, sir. I've just been -

163
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,690
Argh, your face!

164
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:14,640
You're like a melted wolf.
Just a bit smoother.

165
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,820
Argh! What have you done?

166
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,780
Mr Maven, I've been
going through -

167
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:24,170
Your face! Did you fall in a fire?
Stay on the mat! You're dripping!

168

Sporall was right. <font color="00FF00">
Arbiter Jenkins WAS married.

immune from the lottery.

00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,750
Oh, you mean Maven? That's why he's
put himself in the wedding lottery.

210
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,720
So that he can be with me.

211

And then to stroke you gently like this.

215
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,820

I wonder what that means.

216
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,500
It must be some kind of romantic code. Hmm.

218
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:02,140
OK, that's less...
less romantic now.

Alright, Sporall,
I get the message.

220
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,760
Some of us have got work
