1
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,619
<i>Some drink, drink, drink, drink, drink</i>

2
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,285
<i>Do you hear us about</i>

3
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,090
<i>You lazy lout</i>

4
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:48,232
<i>We want some beer</i>
<i>We want some wine</i>

5
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:49,665
<i>We want some wine</i>

6
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,498
<i>We want some beer</i>
<i>We want some wine</i>

7
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,072
<i>We want some beer</i>
<i>We want some wine</i>

8
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,339
<i>Pour out the wine</i>
<i>and drink and drink till morning</i>

9
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,141
<i>Pour out the wine</i>
<i>for drinking is divine</i>

10
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:03,044
<i>It is divine</i>

11
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,617
<i>Pour out the wine</i>
<i>and drink and drink till morning</i>

12
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,481
<i>Pour out the wine</i>

13
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:09,019
<i>Pour out the wine</i>

14
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:15,651
<i>And drink</i>
<i>for drinking is divine</i>

15
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:19,697
<i>We want some wine</i>
<i>and drink till morning</i>

16
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,633
<i>We want some wine</i>
<i>and drink till morning</i>

17
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:26,967
<i>We want some wine</i>
<i>We want some wine</i>

18
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:30,200
<i>And drink and drink till morning</i>

19
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,745
<i>We want some wine</i>

20
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,066
<i>Good day, my friends</i>

21
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:56,896
<i>Good day</i>

22
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,493
<i>A chair, a glass of wine</i>
<i>and a pipe</i>

23
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,631
<i>Excuse me, Master</i>
<i>if you don't mind</i>

24
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:05,471
<i>I'll sit and drink and smoke</i>
<i>same as you</i>

25
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,045
<i>Fair's fair</i>
<i>- How true</i>

26
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:10,980
<i>Make a place for two</i>
<i>Come on, make a place for two</i>

27
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:18,489
<i>Nott' e giorno mal dormire</i>

28
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,991
<i>The devil take you and Mozart</i>

29
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,585
<i>At once, sir</i>

30
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:26,895
<i>What makes you so put out</i>

31
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:30,531
<i>Indeed we never would have known you</i>

32
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,968
<i>Now what on earth</i>
<i>brought that about</i>

33
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,607
<i>Frozen earth all dead or dying</i>

34
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:43,842
<i>There in the snow buried deep</i>

35
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:47,180
<i>And outside where he was lying</i>

36
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:50,778
<i>The sight of a drunkard asleep</i>

37
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,152
<i>That's true</i>

38
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:58,390
<i>Seeing him there</i>
<i>a craving seized my brain</i>

39
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,364
<i>For drinking</i>

40
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:04,163
<i>Yes, drinking</i>

41
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,595
<i>Then do the same</i>

42
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,837
<i>Lie down there in the ditch</i>

43
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,841
<i>- And for a pillow</i>
<i>- The pavement</i>

44
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,672
<i>- And for a roof</i>
<i>- The sky</i>

45
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,609
<i>- What about sheets</i>
<i>- The rain</i>

46
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:18,945
<i>Are you having nightmares, Hoffmann</i>

47
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,315
<i>The first song is yours then</i>

48
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,321
<i>Don't make us ask again</i>

49
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,152
<i>The chorus leave to us</i>

50
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,092
<i>Yes, leave that to us</i>

51
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,125
<i>Right</i>

52
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,163
<i>Choose something that's gay</i>

53
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:36,257
<i>Sing the song of the rat</i>

54
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:39,735
<i>No, we're all sick of that</i>

55
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:41,031
<i>I know</i>

56
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,303
<i>We'll have to have</i>
<i>the one about Kleinzach</i>

57
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,574
<i>Oh, yes, come on</i>
<i>We'll have the song about Kleinzach</i>

58
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:53,250
<i>Right</i>

59
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,185
<i>Here's Kleinzach</i>

60
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,358
<i>Now long ago</i>
<i>the duke of renowned Eisenach</i>

61
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,126
<i>The duke of Eisenach</i>

62
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:12,134
<i>Employed a tiny clown</i>
<i>with the name of Kleinzach</i>

63
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,665
<i>He had the name Kleinzach</i>

64
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:17,264
<i>He wore a busby big and black</i>

65
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:22,006
<i>And his noddle</i>
<i>his noddle did go crick-crack</i>

66
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:23,707
<i>Crick-crack</i>

67
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:24,908
<i>Crick-crack</i>

68
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,842
<i>So that's</i>
<i>So that's Kleinzach</i>

69
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,318
<i>- Crick-crack</i>
<i>- Crick-crack</i>

70
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,151
<i>- Crick-crack</i>
<i>- Crick-crack</i>

71
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:37,118
<i>So that's</i>
<i>So that's</i>

72
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:40,824
<i>Kleinzach</i>

73
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:50,336
<i>He also had a paunch</i>
<i>quite as stout as a stack</i>

74
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,002
<i>As stout as any stack</i>

75
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:57,070
<i>His feet looked just like twigs</i>
<i>sticking out of a sack</i>

76
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,776
<i>Like twigs in any sack</i>

77
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:02,479
<i>He capered like a jumping jack</i>

78
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,419
<i>And his knees cracked together</i>

79
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,788
<i>And went click-clack</i>

80
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:09,292
<i>Click-clack</i>

81
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,623
<i>Click-clack</i>

82
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:13,220
<i>So that's</i>
<i>So that's Kleinzach</i>

83
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:14,697
<i>- Click-clack</i>
<i>- Click-clack</i>

84
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,291
<i>- Click-clack</i>
<i>- Click-clack</i>

85
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:22,636
<i>So that's</i>
<i>So that's</i>

86
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:26,336
<i>Kleinzach</i>

87
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:35,848
<i>Now what words</i>
<i>What words to paint those features</i>

88
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:39,151
<i>Now what words to paint those features</i>

89
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:46,960
<i>Now what words</i>
<i>What words to paint those features</i>

90
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:55,804
<i>To paint those features</i>

91
00:17:55,908 --> 00:18:01,005
<i>Past comparing</i>

92
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:04,975
<i>She is there</i>

93
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,312
<i>Fair</i>

94
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,716
<i>Fair as dawn of the day</i>

95
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:13,952
<i>When love first bade me dare</i>
<i>to leave the home of my youth</i>

96
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,289
<i>And in my heart to swear</i>

97
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:23,824
<i>I would fly far away</i>
<i>to a world we could share</i>

98
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:30,005
<i>Oh, her hair</i>
<i>Oh, her hair with its curls entwining</i>

99
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:35,342
<i>Shed a warmth where the snow</i>
<i>of her bosom was shining</i>

100
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:40,851
<i>Her eyes, her eyes</i>
<i>unfathomed lakes of blue</i>

101
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,820
<i>Spread around where she trod</i>

102
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:47,050
<i>A reflection as true</i>

103
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,855
<i>And as our pageant car</i>

104
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,658
<i>By cupids all attended</i>

105
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:56,291
<i>Sped on with ne'er a jar</i>

106
00:18:56,401 --> 00:19:01,737
<i>Her voice with triumph blended</i>

107
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:08,473
<i>While mortals held their breath</i>

108
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:13,917
<i>Sang out with heavenly art</i>

109
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,954
<i>While mortals held their breath</i>

110
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:20,582
<i>She sang with heavenly art</i>

111
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:27,165
<i>Till echoes melt in death</i>

112
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:34,066
<i>Resounding</i>

113
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,640
<i>Through</i>

114
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:41,274
<i>My heart</i>

115
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:13,001
<i>Oh, Stella</i>

116
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:18,981
<i>Three women blended as one</i>

117
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:23,486
<i>Three souls</i>

118
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:29,391
<i>United as one</i>

119
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,964
<i>True artist</i>

120
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,592
<i>Tender maiden</i>

121
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:40,234
<i>And courtesan</i>

122
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,077
<i>My mistress</i>

123
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:54,346
<i>No, no, rather say my three</i>

124
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:02,454
<i>Three magic visions fair to see</i>

125
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:10,796
<i>Of all my life they claimed a part</i>

126
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,872
<i>Would you hear</i>
<i>the three tales of my folly of love</i>

127
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,538
<i>Yes, yes, yes</i>

128
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:29,680
<i>Now what do you mean</i>
<i>three magic visions</i>

129
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,380
<i>Your pipe</i>

130
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:35,388
<i>And by the time</i>
<i>you have to light it up again</i>

131
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:40,355
<i>You'll know why</i>
<i>when all has been said</i>

132
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:46,199
<i>Even you, who in this tale</i>
<i>of my heart and its pain</i>

133
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:51,866
<i>Showed good sense</i>
<i>and still kept your head</i>

134
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,812
<i>Good sirs</i>
<i>the curtain is going to rise</i>

135
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,076
<i>Let it rise then</i>

136
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:00,412
<i>Let it rise then</i>

137
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,852
<i>- For that we don't care a pin</i>
<i>- No, we don't care a pin</i>

138
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:18,332
<i>Right you are</i>

139
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:22,203
<i>Now we're in our glory</i>

140
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:29,807
<i>While we drink</i>
<i>listen to a story</i>

141
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:36,086
<i>At the clouds of our smoke we gaze</i>

142
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:42,525
<i>And see dreams in the growing haze</i>

143
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:49,794
<i>At the clouds of our smoke we gaze</i>

144
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:55,534
<i>And see dreams</i>

145
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:03,342
<i>In the growing haze</i>

146
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:07,311
<i>I'll begin then</i>

147
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,478
<i>Begin then</i>

148
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:12,523
<i>Begin then</i>

149
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:19,320
<i>Here's the story of the first</i>

150
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:26,735
<i>Olympia was her name</i>

151
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:04,062
<i>There, sleep in peace</i>

152
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:07,701
<i>Aha</i>

153
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:11,799
<i>Modest and sweet and clever</i>

154
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:17,581
<i>Through her I shall endeavor</i>
<i>to recoup the whole sum at a stroke</i>

155
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:21,311
<i>That I lost</i>
<i>when my backer went broke</i>

156
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:26,082
<i>Yes, but what of Coppelius</i>

157
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:31,185
<i>I swear he sits up nights</i>
<i>thinking up ways to blackmail me</i>

158
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:35,289
<i>By filing a claim against me</i>
<i>for inventor's rights</i>

159
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,899
<i>Words fail me</i>

160
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,809
<i>Well, I'm glad he's not here</i>

161
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:51,513
<i>Ah, come in</i>

162
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,281
<i>Sir, good day</i>

163
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,376
<i>An early hour to call, sir</i>

164
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:57,455
<i>Tell me, sir, you're a pupil</i>

165
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,150
<i>Not worth your skill at all, sir</i>

166
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,853
<i>You're too modest, I should say</i>

167
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,987
<i>Pay to art no more attention</i>

168
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:08,827
<i>Learn mechanical invention</i>

169
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:12,028
<i>Then a degree</i>

170
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:14,731
<i>Might come your way</i>

171
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:18,333
<i>There's my daughter to see, sir</i>
<i>She's a heavenly sight</i>

172
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,471
<i>Yes, science is always right</i>
<i>do you hear</i>

173
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,748
<i>Olympia's very, very dear</i>

174
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:29,046
<i>First his science, then his daughter</i>

175
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:31,145
<i>What can be the connection</i>

176
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,520
<i>Cochenille, come to me, sir</i>

177
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:38,893
<i>Go turn up all the lights</i>

178
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,591
<i>And the ch-cham-p-pagne</i>

179
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,258
<i>Leave that to me</i>

180
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,371
<i>Stay here, my boy</i>

181
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:49,963
<i>I'll return to you straight</i>

182
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:04,180
<i>So be it</i>
<i>To my fate I bid defiance</i>

183
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,622
<i>I will study naught but science</i>

184
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,491
<i>Let knowledge come in any guise</i>

185
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:16,256
<i>I must deserve</i>

186
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:19,565
<i>The one I treasure</i>

187
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:25,466
<i>In my heart I feel there's a measure</i>

188
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:30,310
<i>Of the stuff that makes men wise</i>

189
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,645
<i>She is there</i>

190
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:36,854
<i>If I dared</i>

191
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:43,585
<i>She's there</i>

192
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:49,190
<i>Now could I dare</i>

193
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:54,863
<i>Oh, how fair</i>

194
00:27:54,973 --> 00:28:02,311
<i>How divinely fair</i>

195
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:20,727
<i>Ah, could we two together</i>

196
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:24,598
<i>Know the same tomorrow</i>

197
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,967
<i>The same remembered past</i>

198
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:31,598
<i>We could share every joy</i>

199
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:36,977
<i>Could share in every sorrow</i>

200
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:39,573
<i>Could share in every sorrow</i>

201
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:45,748
<i>Yes, every sorrow</i>
<i>we could share to the last</i>

202
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:50,822
<i>May then</i>
<i>Oh, may my dreaming</i>

203
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:55,896
<i>In you reflect the morn</i>

204
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:05,505
<i>Let clouds of glory streaming</i>

205
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:09,944
<i>Proclaim that love is born</i>

206
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:15,451
<i>Let clouds of glory streaming</i>

207
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:23,483
<i>Proclaim that love is born</i>

208
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:53,289
<i>'Tis I, Coppelius</i>

209
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:57,384
<i>Now look out</i>
<i>Very gently</i>

210
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:00,731
<i>A man</i>

211
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:02,555
<i>Who can he be</i>

212
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,928
<i>What's he eyeing so intently</i>

213
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:11,300
<i>Our Olympia, eh</i>

214
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:12,603
<i>Why not</i>

215
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,507
<i>Their Olympia, eh</i>

216
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:18,112
<i>Young fellow</i>
<i>My dear sir</i>

217
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,744
<i>Hears not a jot</i>

218
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:25,719
<i>Dear sir</i>

219
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,959
<i>Dear sir</i>

220
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,459
<i>Yes, what</i>

221
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:36,162
<i>Oh, Coppelius, sir, is my name</i>

222
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:41,463
<i>As a friend</i>
<i>I Signor Spalanzani attend</i>

223
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:44,070
<i>You see all these barometers</i>

224
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,268
<i>And hygrometers and thermometers</i>

225
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:49,778
<i>Very cheap, but pay in cash</i>
<i>and you'll agree you've not been rash</i>

226
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:53,715
<i>These glasses in a flash</i>
<i>turn all as black as a sweep</i>

227
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:56,850
<i>Or else as white as whitening</i>

228
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,479
<i>As white as whitening</i>

229
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,585
<i>Dark as night, dark as night</i>

230
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,183
<i>Bright as lightning</i>

231
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:16,707
<i>I've got eyes, actual eyes, alive</i>

232
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:18,935
<i>And eyes a-blazing</i>

233
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:26,884
<i>I have eyes people prize</i>
<i>for hidden hearts are they appraising</i>

234
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:30,045
<i>And at times it may befall</i>

235
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:32,179
<i>A heart they can present</i>

236
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:35,691
<i>To those who've got none at all</i>

237
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:40,627
<i>I've got eyes, actual eyes, alive</i>

238
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:45,931
<i>And eyes a-blazing</i>

239
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:47,061
<i>I've got eyes</i>

240
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:48,934
<i>Lovely eyes</i>

241
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,371
<i>See</i>

242
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:53,205
<i>Would you try the heart of a woman</i>

243
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:56,075
<i>Whether kind or whether inhuman</i>

244
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,648
<i>Would you rather have the knack</i>

245
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,548
<i>To see it white when it is black</i>

246
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:04,349
<i>Look and you will see</i>
<i>all you want to see</i>

247
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:08,289
<i>Try all my eyes</i>
<i>I've eyes alive and eyes a-blazing</i>

248
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,327
<i>I've eyes the heart appraising</i>

249
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:15,559
<i>Try out my eyes</i>

250
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:24,206
<i>Is that true</i>

251
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:25,435
<i>Well, try</i>

252
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:26,601
<i>Here, then</i>

253
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:29,703
<i>That's three ducats</i>

254
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:31,213
<i>Gracious heaven</i>

255
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,284
<i>Power divine</i>

256
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:38,048
<i>Oh, the charms</i>
<i>that so brightly round her shine</i>

257
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:39,851
<i>Three ducats</i>

258
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:45,194
<i>My love, can this be true</i>

259
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,661
<i>For three ducats</i>

260
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:49,426
<i>Oh, but why snatch away</i>

261
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:53,732
<i>That heavenly vision</i>
<i>of delight and of love</i>

262
00:32:59,143 --> 00:32:59,939
<i>Oh, you</i>

263
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:01,068
<i>Dear professor</i>

264
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,703
<i>Well what</i>
<i>It had all been agreed</i>

265
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,338
- <i>Not in writing</i>
- <i>Still</i>

266
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,974
<i>No jesting</i>

267
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:10,510
<i>A fortune you will realize</i>

268
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:13,351
<i>And half will be mine</i>

269
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,824
<i>Must I keep on protesting</i>

270
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:18,862
<i>Olympia's mine</i>
- <i>Oh, no, she's got my eyes</i>

271
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:20,521
<i>Less loud</i>
<i>Less loud</i>

272
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:22,565
<i>Less loud</i>

273
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,369
<i>Her eyes</i>

274
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:29,235
<i>Yes, he's right</i>
<i>for I don't know how they work</i>

275
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:33,943
<i>But I'll fix it</i>

276
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:34,670
<i>Yes</i>

277
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:41,449
<i>Would you like</i>
<i>a further 500 ducats</i>

278
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:48,090
<i>Just sign for me that you're resigning</i>

279
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:53,494
<i>Her eyes</i>
<i>with all the rest of her designing</i>

280
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:55,862
<i>Then I'll give you a check</i>

281
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:58,595
<i>On the house of Elias</i>

282
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,567
<i>Elias</i>

283
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,570
<i>Splendid reputation</i>

284
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:04,470
<i>Whatever's this negotiation</i>

285
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,344
<i>All right</i>

286
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:08,935
<i>Agreed</i>

287
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:13,643
<i>Come on, come on</i>

288
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,448
<i>My friend indeed</i>

289
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:21,082
<i>I rather think it is he who will pay</i>

290
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,923
<i>By the way, a suggestion</i>

291
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:29,758
<i>Marry off Olympia now</i>

292
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,960
<i>That young fellow there, I vow</i>

293
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,095
<i>Very soon will pop the question</i>

294
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:37,971
<i>My friend indeed</i>

295
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:58,518
<i>That is science, my friend</i>

296
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:01,324
<i>Lord</i>

297
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,263
<i>He's quite demented</i>

298
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:10,671
<i>Oh, sir, the g-guests</i>
<i>w- wait to be presented</i>

299
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:48,605
<i>None but our host</i>
<i>I do declare</i>

00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:21,371
<i>Allow your daughter to meet us</i>

<i>And none so faultless in their graces</i>

315
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:40,030
- <i>We'll not be allowed</i>
- <i>We'll not be allowed to eat</i>

316
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:45,660
<i>Till she's seen us face-to-face</i>
<i>and shown her paces</i>

424
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,321
<i>Unless you expected a dance before</i>

425
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:43,922
<i>No, no, the supper must be respected</i>

426
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:45,797
<i>And then strike up the band</i>

427
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:46,961
<i>Strike up the band</i>

428
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,230
<i>It's just as I planned</i>

429
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,769
<i>Will you allow me</i>

430
00:46:50,874 --> 00:46:54,002
<i>After she has rested</i>
<i>she'll give you a dance</i>

431
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:56,102
<i>Yes, yes</i>

432
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:57,908
<i>There you are</i>
<i>She'll obey</i>

433
00:46:58,015 --> 00:47:01,473
<i>Would you mind if now I suggest</i>

434
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:05,385
<i>That you should stay in here with her</i>
<i>while we're away</i>

435
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,421
<i>It's an honor</i>

436
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:10,050
<i>Now we'll see what he will find to say</i>

437
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,064
<i>She's not eating today</i>

438
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,097
<i>No</i>

439
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:21,661
<i>Food she finds too coarse to mention</i>

440
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:25,097
<i>What's that</i>

441
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:26,870
<i>That</i>

442
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:29,070
<i>Pure invention</i>

443
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,545
<i>Yes, my boy</i>

444
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:33,377
<i>Pure invention</i>

445
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:39,786
<i>S- S-S-Supper is served</i>

446
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:43,782
<i>Supper at last is served</i>

447
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:46,988
<i>Now it's served</i>

448
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:53,493
<i>None but our host, I do declare</i>

449
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:55,435
<i>None, I do declare</i>

450
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,507
<i>Entertains with such a flair</i>

451
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:59,337
<i>With such a flair</i>

452
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:02,970
<i>None but our host, I do declare</i>

453
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,809
<i>None, I do declare</i>

454

<i>Entertains with such a flair</i>

455
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:57,055
<i>So now they've gone away at last</i>

456
00:48:57,167 --> 00:49:00,295
<i>And you are near me</i>

457
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:04,064
<i>Quite, quite alone</i>

458
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:09,503
<i>Oh, may I hope that you will hear me</i>

459
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:16,375
<i>Olympia</i>
<i>Oh, my love</i>

460
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:20,684
<i>Let me gaze for a while</i>

461
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,760
<i>And dazzled by your charms</i>

462
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:28,194
<i>Let me bask in your smile</i>

463
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:30,461
<i>Yes</i>

464
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:32,625
<i>Yes</i>

465
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:37,774
<i>Did I hear a sigh</i>
<i>escape your lips so tender</i>

466
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:43,574
<i>Or was it but a dream</i>
<i>my fever does engender</i>

467
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:45,270
<i>No</i>

468
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:47,775
<i>No</i>

469
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:52,980
<i>Gentle sigh</i>
<i>a pledge of love begun</i>

470
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:55,991
<i>You now are mine</i>

471
00:49:56,093 --> 00:50:02,794
<i>Our hearts forevermore are one</i>

472
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,742
<i>Can you feel, my love</i>

473
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:17,177
<i>That joy ever springing</i>

474
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:21,842
<i>From a heart's silent replies</i>

475
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:26,047
<i>Two souls</i>

476
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:29,717
<i>One in their scheming</i>

477
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:33,694
<i>With a sweep</i>
<i>they are winging</i>

478
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:38,928
<i>Till we ascend the skies</i>

479
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,697
<i>May then</i>

480
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:44,296
<i>Oh, may my dreaming</i>

481
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:48,708
<i>In you reflect the morn</i>

482
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:57,452
<i>May clouds of glory streaming</i>

483
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:02,253
<i>Proclaim that love is born</i>

484
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:06,989
<i>May clouds of glory streaming</i>

485
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:15,869
<i>Proclaim that love is born</i>

486
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:33,619
<i>Oh, my dear, do but stay</i>

487
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:36,692
<i>Why must you leave me so</i>

488
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:39,387
<i>Tell me</i>
<i>Why turn away</i>

489
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:42,590
<i>Then I'll go where you go</i>

490
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:50,535
<i>Oh, good lord</i>
<i>don't get so excited</i>

491
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,835
<i>Come on now and have a good feed</i>

492
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:57,004
<i>Oh, Nicklaus, my love is requited</i>

493
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:59,171
<i>My love</i>

494
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:02,274
<i>Love divine</i>

495
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:03,682
<i>Oh, indeed</i>

496
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,847
<i>If you knew</i>
<i>what against her was cited</i>

497
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,356
<i>What can be cited</i>

498
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:11,325
<i>What</i>
- <i>That she's a dead thing</i>

499
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:15,091
- <i>Great heavens</i>
- <i>Or never was alive</i>

500
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:19,362
<i>Oh, Nicklaus, my love is requited</i>

501
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,867
<i>My love</i>

502
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:25,703
<i>Love divine</i>

503
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:47,696
<i>The cheat</i>
<i>The rogue</i>

504
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:49,594
<i>It's ruination</i>

505
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:55,198
<i>Elias can't meet his obligation</i>

506
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:02,774
<i>So, then all in good time</i>

507
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:08,442
<i>I shall find out the way</i>
<i>to be revenged</i>

508
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:10,910
<i>I'm fleeced</i>

509
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,682
<i>I'm fleeced</i>

510
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:14,518
<i>Me</i>

511
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:23,632
<i>I'll make someone pay</i>

512
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:54,684
<i>Let the dancing proceed</i>

513
00:54:57,594 --> 00:54:59,221
<i>The opening</i>

514
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:00,956
<i>They're repeating</i>

515
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:05,228
<i>How the waltz sets our hearts a-beating</i>

516
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:09,669
<i>Let the gentleman lead you so</i>

517
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:11,433
<i>Now go</i>

518
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:12,599
<i>Yes</i>

519

<i>Now she's dancing</i>

521
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,171
<i>How entrancing</i>

522
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:22,081
<i>Never could art such grace impart</i>

523
00:55:22,185 --> 00:55:23,777
<i>Smiling, smiling</i>

524
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:25,752
<i>How beguiling</i>

525
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:27,447
<i>Light as the air</i>

526
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:29,650
