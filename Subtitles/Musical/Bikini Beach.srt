1
00:00:53,776 --> 00:00:56,574
<i>Summer's here, it's a holiday</i>

2
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:59,341
<i>School is out,
now it's time to play</i>

3
00:00:59,415 --> 00:01:02,043
<i>Just get the schoolbooks
out of reach</i>

4
00:01:02,117 --> 00:01:04,278
<i>We're gonna go
to Bikini Beach</i>

5
00:01:04,386 --> 00:01:07,844
<i>That's it, that's right</i>

6
00:01:07,923 --> 00:01:09,948
<i>That's where the fun is at</i>

7
00:01:10,059 --> 00:01:12,928
<i>That's it, that's right</i>

8
00:01:12,929 --> 00:01:17,700
<i>All the chicks are bikini clad</i>

9
00:01:17,901 --> 00:01:20,995
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

10
00:01:31,348 --> 00:01:34,584
<i>That's it, that's right</i>

11
00:01:34,585 --> 00:01:36,450
<i>That's where the fun is at</i>

12
00:01:36,653 --> 00:01:38,952
<i>That's it, that's right</i>

13
00:01:40,057 --> 00:01:42,525
<i>All the chicks are bikini clad</i>

14
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,762
<i>We're on our own,
we're on our way</i>

15
00:01:50,868 --> 00:01:53,598
<i>The gang's all heading for a holiday</i>

16
00:01:53,704 --> 00:01:56,537
<i>A lot of girls and
a guy for each</i>

17
00:01:56,607 --> 00:01:58,242
<i>Come on let's go
to Bikini Beach</i>

18
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,378
<i>That's it, that's right</i>

19
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:03,472
<i>That's where the fun is at</i>

20
00:02:03,548 --> 00:02:06,881
<i>That's it, that's right</i>

21
00:02:06,985 --> 00:02:10,853
<i>All the chicks are bikini clad!</i>

22
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,326
<i>That's it, that's right</i>

23
00:02:15,393 --> 00:02:17,327
<i>Keep the short shorts
out of sight</i>

24
00:02:17,395 --> 00:02:21,307
<i>That's it, that's right</i>

25
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,500
<i>Gonna be, who needs short shorts?</i>

26
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:25,836
<i>Beach party tonight</i>

27
00:02:32,678 --> 00:02:33,838
<i>That's right</i>

28
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,675
Come on. Let's hit it!

29
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:42,183
Come on, let's go.

30
00:02:52,417 --> 00:02:54,598
This should keep the wolves
away from our door.

31
00:02:57,371 --> 00:02:59,896
Hey, isn't there some way
we can lock this thing?

32
00:02:59,907 --> 00:03:01,898
From the inside or the outside?

33
00:03:01,975 --> 00:03:04,277
What's the matter, Animal,
don't you trust the boys?

34
00:03:04,278 --> 00:03:06,312
It isn't that. I don't trust me.

35
00:03:06,513 --> 00:03:09,616
Hey, Candy, who do you have
to know to get into girls' town?

36
00:03:09,617 --> 00:03:11,175
I'm available.

37
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,786
I bet you this is what you
had in mind. Huh, Animal?

38
00:03:14,855 --> 00:03:16,982
Okay, Candy, put him down.

39
00:03:24,165 --> 00:03:26,599
That Candy really has the power.

40
00:03:29,705 --> 00:03:31,002
Dee Dee?

41
00:03:32,507 --> 00:03:35,089
There's a moon out there
and it's calling us.

42
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,352
I don't hear anything.

43
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,261
All right. The moon isn't calling
but the waves are.

44
00:03:38,262 --> 00:03:40,126
We can go sit by them
until we get the message,

45
00:03:40,127 --> 00:03:42,502
while the children sleep.

46
00:03:42,503 --> 00:03:45,677
Frankie, you go listen
to the moon and the waves.

47
00:03:45,678 --> 00:03:48,418
Until I hear wedding bells,
I’m children too.

48
00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:52,206
You win some.
You lose quite a few.

49
00:04:10,796 --> 00:04:14,149
- Oh, Bixby's Bird Farm!
- Oh, Cora, will you...

50
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,448
Oh, all right, all right.

51
00:04:24,778 --> 00:04:26,769
Holy hot curl!

52
00:04:26,858 --> 00:04:28,023
Girls, come here!

53
00:04:28,024 --> 00:04:30,021
I wanna show you
something. Hurry up.

54
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:32,584
Wake up, you guys.
Wake up, hurry up.

55
00:04:32,636 --> 00:04:34,531
- I wanna show you something.
- What is it?

56
00:04:34,532 --> 00:04:35,979
Throw your eyes at that!

57
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,125
The Sheik of Araby
has pitched his pad among us!

58
00:04:38,126 --> 00:04:39,453
Might be a mirage.

59
00:04:39,454 --> 00:04:40,775
Let's go give it the
double “O,” huh?

60
00:04:40,776 --> 00:04:41,757
Hey, what's a double “O”?

61
00:04:41,758 --> 00:04:45,057
Once over, Goo Goo.
Come on, you guys.

62
00:04:52,186 --> 00:04:54,279
It's the Potato Bug!
He's here!

63
00:05:00,012 --> 00:05:02,810
They've all gone beetle
over a Potato Bug.

64
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:09,800
That ain't no mirage.

65
00:05:13,114 --> 00:05:15,633
Dee Dee, I think we associate
with a very unstable group.

66
00:05:15,634 --> 00:05:17,993
Come on. It won't do any harm
to have a look.

67
00:05:17,994 --> 00:05:20,257
Don't tell me you've flipped over
that crumpet eater.

68
00:05:20,258 --> 00:05:22,473
Well, they say he's
very nice, personally.

69
00:05:22,474 --> 00:05:24,650
Personally, I can live
without finding out.

70
00:05:24,651 --> 00:05:25,460
Well, I can't.

71
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,132
I must insist you be
as quiet as possible.

72
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:32,645
His eminence is sleeping.

73
00:05:32,646 --> 00:05:34,465
His eminence?

74
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:37,643
- Are you his girl or something?
- No.

75
00:05:37,644 --> 00:05:40,703
My name is Yvonne,
but I am called Lady Bug.

76
00:05:40,704 --> 00:05:43,138
I am the Potato Bug's bodyguard.

77
00:05:43,853 --> 00:05:45,013
Oh, yeah.

78
00:05:45,163 --> 00:05:47,996
- Who guards your body?
- I do.

79
00:05:51,196 --> 00:05:54,883
What if some big handsome brute,
and I'm not naming names,

80
00:05:54,884 --> 00:05:57,275
figured he'd make some
time with you?

81
00:05:57,276 --> 00:06:00,530
Why, you and I, we could make some
beautiful music together.

82
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:03,432
Why, just come on
into these arms, baby.

83
00:06:06,396 --> 00:06:09,275
- Hey, that's something!
- It’s called Savate.

84
00:06:09,276 --> 00:06:11,073
- Sa-who?
- Savate.

85
00:06:11,156 --> 00:06:14,275
In French, that means
the art of foot fighting.

86
00:06:14,276 --> 00:06:15,402
You know something?

87
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:18,027
She can do with her feet
what Candy can do with her...

88
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:20,360
- Giant ground swells!
- ...hips.

89
00:06:20,403 --> 00:06:22,371
Wake surfing!

90
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:21,743
- This is it, huh, Dee Dee?
- Sure, it is, for now.

91
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:23,867
Our forever is right now.

92
00:08:23,868 --> 00:08:27,706
- But what about tomorrow?
- Tomorrow is the day after today.

93
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,408
Frankie, there's a real tomorrow.

94
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:30,466
You gotta think about that.

95
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:31,843
Sure, I'll think about it.

96
00:08:32,191 --> 00:08:32,957
Tomorrow.

97
00:08:33,508 --> 00:08:36,443
You know something?
I got a feeling

98
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,311
somebody's watching us.

99
00:08:46,787 --> 00:08:49,278
I get the strangest feeling.

100
00:08:55,859 --> 00:08:58,191
Something's wrong around here.

101
00:09:01,355 --> 00:09:02,845
Yes, indeed.

102
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:09,285
<i>You gotta have a
rhythm when you dance</i>

103
00:09:09,651 --> 00:09:11,726
<i>When you gamble,
gotta take a chance</i>

104
00:09:11,727 --> 00:09:14,389
<i>But when you wanna
try a little romance</i>

105
00:09:14,462 --> 00:09:18,626
<i>Then love's a secret weapon</i>

106
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,433
Well, Clyde, they're doing your dance.

107
00:09:23,434 --> 00:09:25,506
<i>Take a little chance
and look him in the eye</i>

108
00:09:25,507 --> 00:09:27,975
<i>All you gotta do is give it a try</i>

109
00:09:28,162 --> 00:09:32,394
<i>Yes, love's a secret weapon</i>

110
00:09:33,562 --> 00:09:39,010
<i>So come on and take my advice</i>

111
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,444
<i>You'll find...</i>

112
00:09:40,611 --> 00:09:44,441
Clyde, Clyde, watch the paint.
Clyde, stop.

113
00:09:44,442 --> 00:09:49,175
<i>It’s time you started to believe</i>

114
00:09:49,858 --> 00:09:55,657
<i>That's how Adam was
won by Eve, oh!</i>

115
00:09:55,658 --> 00:09:58,385
<i>That's the secret of
the whole affair</i>

116
00:09:58,386 --> 00:10:01,082
<i>Give a little love
and tender care</i>

117
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,650
<i>If you're gonna get him
and keep him there</i>

118
00:10:03,722 --> 00:10:08,386
<i>Then love's a secret weapon</i>

119
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:24,839
<i>So come on, take my advice</i>

120
00:10:25,235 --> 00:10:29,672
<i>Well, you'll find that
love is kind of nice</i>

121
00:10:30,874 --> 00:10:35,277
<i>It’s time you started to believe</i>

122
00:10:36,442 --> 00:10:42,138
<i>That's how Adam was
won by Eve, oh!</i>

123
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:44,729
<i>That's the secret of
the whole affair</i>

124
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,392
<i>Give a little love
and tender care</i>

125
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,949
<i>If you're gonna get him
and keep him there</i>

126
00:10:50,074 --> 00:10:54,306
<i>Then love's a secret weapon</i>

127
00:10:55,474 --> 00:11:00,104
<i>Then love's a secret weapon</i>

128
00:11:00,985 --> 00:11:05,046
<i>Yes, love's a secret weapon</i>

129
00:11:05,746 --> 00:11:07,577
<i>Yeah!</i>

130
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:15,601
Hey, there's a monkey!

131
00:11:19,853 --> 00:11:21,616
Hey, hey! Look!

132
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:26,158
I thought the Potato Bug was taller.

133
00:11:26,196 --> 00:11:29,393
Hey, I was right.
That monkey was watching us.

134
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:33,252
Clyde. Come along, Clyde.

135
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,800
Give them back their ball.

136
00:11:35,016 --> 00:11:38,577
All right, Clyde.
All right, Clyde. Clyde!

137
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:41,599
- Hey, Tarzan! Where's Jane?
- Let's go check.

138
00:11:43,841 --> 00:11:46,105
Clyde, come on.
Clyde, Clyde, Clyde.

139
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,544
Come along. Come along.
Come along, Clyde.

140
00:12:09,224 --> 00:12:12,318
Clyde. Clyde, come here.
Clyde!

141
00:12:14,377 --> 00:12:17,343
Now, may I ask whose board
this happens to be?

142
00:12:17,344 --> 00:12:18,606
- It’s mine.
- Oh, really.

143
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,603
- Well, may I use it?
- Be my guest.

144
00:12:20,904 --> 00:12:23,247
- Clyde?
- Hey, hold it, now. No, no.

145
00:12:23,248 --> 00:12:25,361
Son, just step back.
Watch, please.

146
00:12:25,362 --> 00:12:27,776
I assure you.
Everything is all right.

147
00:12:28,345 --> 00:12:29,812
Look at him.

148
00:12:32,104 --> 00:12:35,938
- Oh, come on. What is this?
- No way. No way.

149
00:12:43,993 --> 00:12:46,928
Well, he's paddling
at least. Not bad.

150
00:13:02,024 --> 00:13:03,958
You gotta be kidding!

151
00:13:08,328 --> 00:13:10,199
- He made it!
- Hey, look at that!

152
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,259
- It’s fantastic!
- Great!

153
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,745
Hey, look at him!
Look at him turn! The bottom turn!

154
00:13:21,838 --> 00:13:24,413
- Hey, Deadhead, he's better than you!
- Better looking, too!

155
00:13:24,414 --> 00:13:26,075
Yeah!

156
00:13:30,127 --> 00:13:33,563
- A headstand? That's it.
- No more. That's it.

157
00:13:49,734 --> 00:13:51,895
Marvelous, yes.

158
00:13:58,863 --> 00:14:01,923
- Did you enjoy Clyde's performance?
- Oh, yeah.

159
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,301
He's a real sharp chimp.

160
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:05,269
Well, I’m afraid you're missing the point.

161
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:08,899
You see, the point is not
whether Clyde is sharp.

162
00:14:08,918 --> 00:14:12,911
The point is that the intelligence
of you young people has fallen to his level.

163
00:14:13,374 --> 00:14:14,902
What's he talking about?

164
00:14:14,903 --> 00:14:17,333
I’m determined to prove that you
young people are borderline cases,

165
00:14:17,334 --> 00:14:19,131
leaning toward feeble-mindedness,

166
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,243
with an abnormal
preoccupation with sex.

167
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,301
- Well, yeah!
- That's all right.

168
00:14:23,302 --> 00:14:25,502
The only display of knowledge
being of a carnal nature.

169
00:14:25,503 --> 00:14:28,085
Would you mind repeating
that in English?

170
00:14:28,086 --> 00:14:29,485
Quiet, Goo Goo.

171
00:14:30,126 --> 00:14:32,686
You photograph quite well, Clyde.

172
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:40,229
Well, that's rather good,
don't you think?

173
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:43,429
- That's not bad. It’s kind of cute.
- Yeah, it's cute.

174
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:46,365
- Well, who are you, anyway?
- Harvey Huntington Honeywagon.

175
00:14:46,494 --> 00:14:49,622
- I'd keep that quiet if I were you.
- The Third.

176
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:52,285
Oh, you got the old folks' home
down by the beach.

177
00:14:52,286 --> 00:14:55,778
Sea-Esta by the Sea
is a resort for senior citizens.

178
00:14:55,855 --> 00:14:58,381
And your irresponsible
behavior has...

179
00:14:58,382 --> 00:15:00,246
been a blemish on
that fine community.

180
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:01,805
And I intend to do
something about it.

181
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,557
- Hey, Frank, put him in his place!
- Wait a second! Wait a second! Look.

182
00:15:04,558 --> 00:15:05,805
This is a public beach.

183
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:08,070
And just what do you think
you're gonna do something about?

184
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:11,457
Well, you read tomorrow's paper,
under this picture.

185
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:13,782
Those of you who can read, that is.

186
00:15:13,783 --> 00:15:16,365
Hey, man, I went to school.

187
00:15:16,366 --> 00:15:18,926
Come on, Clyde. Come on.

188
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,585
The nerve of that clown!

189
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:28,130
Yeah, he looks like something
out of The Twilight Zone.

190
00:15:28,131 --> 00:15:31,287
Imagine, comparing us to monkeys.

191
00:15:31,288 --> 00:15:34,086
Deadhead, you might
be the missing link.

192
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,892
Oh, I say there!
Over here.

193
00:15:36,893 --> 00:15:38,656
- It’s the Potato Bug!
- It’s the Potato Bug!

194
00:15:44,349 --> 00:15:48,376
Look at him! There's nobody
in the whole world like him!

195
00:15:49,726 --> 00:15:52,559
- Oh, I wouldn't say that.
- I would.

196
00:15:53,064 --> 00:15:56,974
Yes. That was a jolly good show.
Yes, jolly good indeed.

197
00:15:56,975 --> 00:16:02,038
That simian creature, most amazing.
Positively remarkable!

198
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,112
Did you come here
for surfing, Mr. Bug?

199
00:16:04,113 --> 00:16:07,981
Oh, no. Crumbs, no.
Not enough speed, really.

200
00:16:08,337 --> 00:16:10,891
Oh, yeah? Did you ever
see a real hot dog...

201
00:16:10,892 --> 00:16:13,331
hit the big wild ones
at 80 miles an hour?

202
00:16:13,655 --> 00:16:16,190
I’m afraid I don't
quite understand...

203
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:19,059
your Yankee-type
colloquialism, old chap.

204
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:21,376
A hot dog is a surfer, Potato Bug.

205
00:16:21,377 --> 00:16:23,811
A hot dog's a surfer.

206
00:16:24,897 --> 00:16:28,032
I thought you all spoke English
here in the colonies.

207
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:30,961
- Oh, it's not required. It’s an elective.
- Oh.

208
00:16:30,962 --> 00:16:36,059
I mean, 80 miles an hour
really isn't very fast at all.

209
00:16:36,865 --> 00:16:39,527
Oh, well, what would you call fast?

210
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:41,496
I don't know. Two hundred.

211
00:16:41,655 --> 00:16:43,430
Two hundred and twenty.
That sort of thing.

212
00:16:43,431 --> 00:16:46,042
Where it's a teensy-weensy
bit frightening,

213
00:16:46,043 --> 00:16:48,159
with a spot of danger involved.

214
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,255
Yes. Well, I'd be delighted to show
you chaps tomorrow if you'd like.

215
00:16:52,256 --> 00:16:54,383
Just come over to the drag strip.

216
00:16:55,007 --> 00:16:58,182
- Hey, you got a rail under there?
- Oh, quite.

217
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:02,222
Little hobby of mine, you know.
Jolly good fun. Yes.

218
00:17:02,223 --> 00:17:08,253
But you 80-mile-an-hour chaps
might find it a bit too devilish.

219
00:17:08,767 --> 00:17:11,167
You might just find
we can be pretty good.

220
00:17:11,471 --> 00:17:13,094
Hey, let's get off this kick.

221
00:17:13,095 --> 00:17:15,962
Maybe the Potato Bug
will sing something for us.

222
00:17:16,463 --> 00:17:18,556
Right-o. Just a few measures.

223
00:17:32,853 --> 00:17:36,028
<i>Ooh, I don't wanna
be the richest man</i>

224
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:37,276
<i>Ooh, yeah, yeah!</i>

225
00:17:37,277 --> 00:17:40,604
<i>All I wanna do is hold your hand</i>

226
00:17:40,605 --> 00:17:41,973
<i>Ooh, yeah, yeah!</i>

227
00:17:41,974 --> 00:17:44,381
<i>Riches won't buy you everything</i>

228
00:17:44,382 --> 00:17:48,628
<i>I just want what love can bring</i>

229
00:17:48,629 --> 00:17:51,796
<i>Ooh, give me your love!</i>

230
00:17:51,797 --> 00:17:55,060
<i>I don't want what
money can buy</i>

231
00:17:55,061 --> 00:17:56,372
<i>Ooh, yeah, yeah!</i>

232
00:17:56,373 --> 00:17:59,629
<i>Come on, little girl
and I'll tell you why</i>

233
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,004
<i>Ooh, yeah, yeah!</i>

234
00:18:01,005 --> 00:18:03,468
<i>Money won't buy you happiness</i>

235
00:18:03,469 --> 00:18:07,628
<i>All I need is your sweet kiss</i>

236
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:10,820
<i>Ooh, give me your love</i>

237
00:18:10,821 --> 00:18:14,044
<i>Now that you know what
I’m searching for</i>

238
00:18:14,045 --> 00:18:15,411
<i>Ooh, yeah, yeah!</i>

239
00:18:15,412 --> 00:18:18,756
<i>Say you'll be mine forevermore</i>

240
00:18:18,757 --> 00:18:20,140
<i>Ooh, yeah, yeah!</i>

241
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,556
<i>You know I gotta
find a love somehow</i>

242
00:18:22,557 --> 00:18:25,633
<i>Say you're gonna
make me happy now</i>

243
00:18:31,438 --> 00:18:33,848
<i>Ooh, give me your love!</i>

244
00:18:36,493 --> 00:18:37,798
<i>Ooh, give me your love!</i>

245
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:40,093
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah!</i>

246
00:18:45,322 --> 00:18:47,736
There now, that ought
to be sufficient.

247
00:18:47,737 --> 00:18:50,384
I'm really not one of
my fans, you know.

248
00:18:50,385 --> 00:18:52,192
I knew we had something in common.

249
00:18:52,193 --> 00:18:54,247
Something in common?

250
00:18:56,673 --> 00:18:59,185
Oh, yes! Quite humorous.

251
00:18:59,186 --> 00:19:01,233
If you want to take it that way.

252
00:19:01,234 --> 00:19:03,966
It's time for your midmorning tea,
your eminence.

253
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:05,023
Oh, yes.

254
00:19:05,024 --> 00:19:09,230
For the days when I was just plain old
Peter Royce Bentley of Sussex.

255
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,118
Oh, well. That's the price
one must pay, you know.

256
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,782
Cheerio, cheerio.

257
00:19:13,783 --> 00:19:14,866
Let's go, lassie.

258
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:24,034
To the office, Clyde.

259
00:19:33,935 --> 00:19:35,893
Watch where you're going, Clyde!

260
00:19:48,894 --> 00:19:51,565
Charlie, tell me I didn't see
a monkey driving that Rolls.

261
00:19:54,566 --> 00:19:57,716
I’m not gonna report that to headquarters.
They'll think I’m crazy.

262
00:19:57,717 --> 00:20:00,020
I’m not gonna report it.

263
00:20:00,021 --> 00:20:02,255
Captain will think I’m
back on the sauce.

264
00:20:04,256 --> 00:20:05,668
Let's take another look, huh?

265
00:20:25,287 --> 00:20:26,972
It’s a monkey all right.

266
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,198
Sarge?

267
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:35,606
Sarge, you're not gonna believe this.

268
00:20:35,607 --> 00:20:41,478
But Charlie and I are tailing a Rolls-Royce
that's being driven by a monkey.

269
00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:44,807
No, no, Sarge, by "monkey",
I don't mean some kind of punk.

270
00:20:44,808 --> 00:20:47,822
I mean a real, live, furry...

271
00:20:47,823 --> 00:20:50,206
Right, Sarge. Right.

272
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,173
Okay, Sarge. Right.

273
00:20:53,655 --> 00:20:56,118
What'd he say?

274
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:59,300
Promised not to tell the captain
if we'll go get some black coffee.

275
00:21:15,495 --> 00:21:17,727
You know, that monkey drives better
than my mother-in-law.

276
00:21:17,728 --> 00:21:20,550
Come to think of it,
he's better looking too.

277
00:21:20,551 --> 00:21:22,814
Just because he pushes a rail, big deal.

278
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:24,590
Any grease monkey could learn that.

279
00:21:24,591 --> 00:21:26,846
- Even you.
- Yeah, even me.

280
00:21:26,847 --> 00:21:30,655
Great. Now you've really found
a sure way to kill yourself, drag racing.

281
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:34,350
Speaking of drags, I have the
feeling I’m with one right now.

282
00:21:34,351 --> 00:21:36,118
Frankie, if you want to learn something,

283
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:38,894
why don't you learn to get yourself a job
now that school's out,

284
00:21:38,895 --> 00:21:40,886
<i>or learn to settle down?</i>

285
00:21:40,887 --> 00:21:42,574
<i>Oh, you're suggesting a slow death.</i>

286
00:21:42,575 --> 00:21:45,246
No thanks. When I go,
I wanna go in a hurry.

287
00:21:45,247 --> 00:21:47,651
Me, too. Goodbye.

288
00:21:50,487 --> 00:21:53,870
- Oh, I say there. Having a spot of bother?
- Oh, it's nothing.

289
00:21:53,871 --> 00:21:56,270
Oh, bit of a row with
your frankfurter, eh?

290
00:21:56,271 --> 00:21:58,110
What seems to be the problem, love?

291
00:21:58,111 --> 00:22:01,830
He's got suicidal tendencies.
He wants to be a dragster.

292
00:22:01,831 --> 00:22:03,623
<i>Bit of a sticky wicket, what?</i>

293
00:22:03,624 --> 00:22:07,350
I mean, a chipper filly like you
shouldn't be a poor widow.

294
00:22:07,351 --> 00:22:08,470
Oh, I agree.

295
00:22:08,471 --> 00:22:11,022
What would you say
about being a rich one?

296
00:22:11,023 --> 00:22:12,702
What do you mean?

297
00:22:12,703 --> 00:22:15,566
Well, I wouldn't mind
having you for my bird.

298
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:18,271
- Bird?
- Girl.

299
00:22:18,272 --> 00:22:20,103
You're no different than he is.

300
00:22:20,104 --> 00:22:23,086
Oh, fiddlesticks and rubbish.
I’m rich, you know.

301
00:22:23,087 --> 00:22:26,246
- Money isn't everything.
- It is to a widow.

302
00:22:26,247 --> 00:22:27,982
- Yeah.
- Come along, duck.

303
00:22:27,983 --> 00:22:29,614
Let's have a spot of tea, eh?

304
00:22:29,615 --> 00:22:31,502
- Well, why not?
- Yes.

305
00:22:31,503 --> 00:22:32,813
"Why not?"

306
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,822
- Eighteen million!
- Yes.

307
00:22:39,823 --> 00:22:42,070
Bit of a slow day.

308
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:44,974
Oh, well. Carry on. Come, love.

309
00:22:44,975 --> 00:22:49,543
Great. A Potato Bug, a chimpanzee
and now this.

310
00:22:49,544 --> 00:22:51,446
My cup runneth over.

311
00:22:51,447 --> 00:22:54,338
"Today's teenager true sub-culture."

312
00:22:55,351 --> 00:22:58,255
"Youth of today leaves
no hope for tomorrow."

313
00:22:58,256 --> 00:23:01,726
"Yesterday, in broad daylight,
in a place illegally called Bikini Beach,"

314
00:23:01,727 --> 00:23:03,774
"we were witness to scenes
of wild perversion"

315
00:23:03,775 --> 00:23:06,038
"and abandonment that defy description.

316
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:09,254
"The solution is for the county
to condemn the surfing area."

317
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:12,215
"By making this facility unavailable
to these potential delinquents,"

318
00:23:12,216 --> 00:23:14,382
"we could persuade them
into more useful endeavors"

319
00:23:14,383 --> 00:23:16,143
"than studying each other's anatomy."

320
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,878
"It might be fitting to warn
responsible parents"

321
00:23:18,879 --> 00:23:22,390
"who grew straight and tall by
building our character on the three R's,

322
00:23:22,391 --> 00:23:25,070
"that our children have progressed
to the three S's,

323
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:28,967
"surfing, speed and sex,
not necessarily in that order."

324
00:23:28,968 --> 00:23:32,270
I do turn rather a handsome phrase.

325
00:23:32,271 --> 00:23:34,030
I’m sorry, sir. I tried
to stop her but she...

326
00:23:34,031 --> 00:23:36,038
How dare you break into my office!

327
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,534
Don't you "how dare" me.

328
00:23:37,535 --> 00:23:41,150
How dare you print this vicious article
against these vacationing kids.

329
00:23:41,151 --> 00:23:43,543
It’s untrue and I demand
to speak to your publisher.

330
00:23:43,544 --> 00:23:45,471
Madam, I am the publisher.

331
00:23:45,472 --> 00:23:47,910
Please identify yourself
and explain this outburst.

332
00:23:47,911 --> 00:23:51,879
You may go now, Miss Simms,
and please go gently.

333
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,143
This editorial has no basis in fact.

334
00:23:54,144 --> 00:23:55,543
Now, who are you?

335
00:23:55,544 --> 00:23:57,583
And why do you get so wrought up
over these juvenile delinquents?

336
00:23:57,584 --> 00:24:00,366
- They're not juvenile delinquents.
- I resent that.

337
00:24:00,367 --> 00:24:01,678
And I resent these lies.

338
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,662
Look, I’m a schoolteacher
and I know these kids.

339
00:24:04,663 --> 00:24:07,638
Those surfers are building
strong, healthy bodies,

340
00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:10,031
and together with
the boys who build the dragsters,

341
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,863
they'll be responsible
for tomorrow's rockets to the moon.

342
00:24:12,864 --> 00:24:16,054
Well, now, that doesn't auger too well
for the future, does it?

343
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:18,918
Well, what's wrong with physical fitness?
You should try it sometime.

344
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:23,166
I do not deplore physical fitness,
but I do deplore half-naked young ladies,

345
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:26,551
if they may be called that,
running around in these scanty bikinis.

346
00:24:26,552 --> 00:24:28,671
Imagine, boys and girls
sleeping on the beach,

347
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,846
side by side, unchaperoned.

348
00:24:30,847 --> 00:24:33,422
Now, what kind of a society is it
that would allow such a thing?

349
00:24:33,423 --> 00:24:34,982
And what kind of a mind is it

350
00:24:34,983 --> 00:24:38,366
that's always ready to believe
there's something wrong?

351
00:24:38,367 --> 00:24:40,167
You need an education, madam.

352
00:24:40,168 --> 00:24:41,599
Well, it's miss. Miss Clements.

353
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,391
Are you willing to devote an afternoon
to seeing the truth?

354
00:24:44,392 --> 00:24:46,334
Is that a challenge?

355
00:24:46,335 --> 00:24:48,702
In that case,
it would be a pleasure.

356
00:24:48,703 --> 00:24:52,414
Very well. I shall take you
to a teenage haunt known as

357
00:24:52,415 --> 00:24:54,955
Big Drag's Pit Stop.

358
00:25:13,792 --> 00:25:15,078
Ball.

359
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:21,238
Quiet, or you'll wind up on the menu.

360
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:35,510
Ball three.
Ball too high.

361
00:25:35,511 --> 00:25:38,190
One more crack out of you
and you'll be today's special.

362
00:25:38,191 --> 00:25:41,600
I just call them as
I see them. You bum.

363
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:52,598
What a mess.

364
00:25:55,999 --> 00:25:58,480
Answer the door.
Answer the door.

365
00:26:00,504 --> 00:26:01,703
I’m closed.

366
00:26:01,704 --> 00:26:04,950
<i>I’m Harvey Huntington
Honeywagon III.</i>

367
00:26:04,951 --> 00:26:07,502
In that case, I’m open.

368
00:26:28,935 --> 00:26:32,688
- What do you think this is, a zoo?
- One would assume so.

369
00:26:34,831 --> 00:26:38,950
- That's Frieda, my bird.
- Oh, and this is Clyde.

370
00:26:38,951 --> 00:26:41,142
- How do you do?
- And Miss Clements.

371
00:26:41,143 --> 00:26:43,518
- How do you do?
- Hello.

372
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:48,047
- Oh, rather unkempt, I should say.
- I've been cleaning up.

373
00:26:48,048 --> 00:26:52,558
I always clean up in the daytime
because I always clean up at night.

374
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,238
Oh, then I assume you are
the person known as Big Drag?

375
00:26:55,239 --> 00:27:01,015
Yeah. That's me, Big Drag.
Pleased to meet you.

376
00:27:01,016 --> 00:27:03,687
Oh. Oh, excuse me.
I also dabble in the arts.

377
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:07,366
Well, Mr. Drag, we're on a mission.
A crusade, you might say.

378
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:10,230
Well, I don't think there's enough room
in here for a crusade.

379
00:27:10,231 --> 00:27:11,918
Did you read the paper this morning?

380
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,014
Particularly an article
about the youth of today?

381
00:27:14,015 --> 00:27:17,367
Sure, first thing.
Right after the comics.

382
00:27:17,368 --> 00:27:19,063
Won't you sit down?

383
00:27:19,064 --> 00:27:22,222
We're closed, but
I guess we're open.

384
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:23,838
So, why don't somebody buy something?

385
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:25,798
Well, I’ll have a martini.

386
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:28,342
We don't serve booze in Big Drag's.

387
00:27:28,343 --> 00:27:30,844
Notice there are no cigarette
machines around either.

388
00:27:30,845 --> 00:27:33,927
This is strictly for kids.
Beer and soft drinks.

389
00:27:33,928 --> 00:27:36,278
I’m with you, Big Drag.
Make mine a beer.

390
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,958
And I shall have a soft drink.

391
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:40,070
Straight or over the rocks?

392
00:27:40,071 --> 00:27:41,302
One beer.

393
00:27:41,303 --> 00:27:44,910
Mr. Drag, I understand you're quite
an authority on the youth of today.

394
00:27:44,911 --> 00:27:46,334
You mean kids?

395
00:27:46,335 --> 00:27:49,119
I see them all day at the drag
strip and all night here.

396
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,879
Well, then you shall
be able to help me.

397
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,734
That article you saw
in the paper this morning

398
00:27:52,735 --> 00:27:55,974
was one of a series I’m doing on the
depravities of the youth of today.

399
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:57,190
What depravities?

400
00:27:57,191 --> 00:27:58,886
Did you ever see the kids
at the drag strip?

401
00:27:58,887 --> 00:27:59,854
Certainly not.

402
00:27:59,855 --> 00:28:02,510
- Did you ever see the kids that come here?
- Of course not.

403
00:28:02,511 --> 00:28:05,215
Then the authority I am, you ain't.

404
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:09,550
My dear sir, I am not accustomed
to being treated so cavalierly.

405
00:28:09,551 --> 00:28:12,630
Nor was my father,
H.H. Honeywagon II,

406
00:28:12,631 --> 00:28:16,294
nor his sainted father,
H.H. Honeywagon I

407
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:18,878
You sure come from a long line
of Honeywagons.

408
00:28:18,879 --> 00:28:21,038
In other words,
you have nothing to say to me.

409
00:28:23,151 --> 00:28:25,630
Not in front of everyone.
Oh, Clyde.

410
00:28:26,431 --> 00:28:28,822
Yes, I do have one thing to say.

411
00:28:28,823 --> 00:28:32,622
don't like the way your Clyde
is looking at my bird.

412
00:28:32,623 --> 00:28:35,738
Well, I don't like the way your bird
is looking at my Clyde.

413
00:28:38,055 --> 00:28:40,142
Stop playing with my bird.

414
00:28:40,143 --> 00:28:42,641
Now, come along. Come along.
Come along, Clyde. Come along.

415
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:47,886
- Stop it!
- Good day, sir!

416
00:28:47,887 --> 00:28:50,342
Clyde.

417
00:28:50,343 --> 00:28:53,095
I should stay closed.
It’s better for business.

418
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,647
Hey! My paintings are
not for sale, sir.

419
00:29:07,648 --> 00:29:10,054
There's part of me
on those canvasses.

420
00:29:10,055 --> 00:29:13,576
It hurts me to see anybody look
at them like they might buy them.

421
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:20,695
I’ll get it.

422
00:29:20,696 --> 00:29:21,871
Who was that?

423
00:29:21,872 --> 00:29:25,366
He's a famous art dealer.
He's been after my stuff for a long time.

424
00:29:25,367 --> 00:29:29,110
But I won't sell.
Big Drag is for the ages.

425
00:29:29,111 --> 00:29:32,918
Someday when I’m gone,
some proud collector will say,

426
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:36,622
"Look at this! It’s a real Drag."

427
00:30:11,855 --> 00:30:13,742
My place!

428
00:30:13,743 --> 00:30:17,806
- Done it again, boss.
- You stupid. Fix it.

429
00:30:17,807 --> 00:30:20,054
Hey, you. Stupid. Fix it.

430
00:30:20,055 --> 00:30:21,582
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What do you want?

431
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:24,014
What's going on here?
What is that... What is that all about?

432
00:30:24,015 --> 00:30:26,438
What's going on?
You'll kill somebody!

433
00:30:26,439 --> 00:30:28,855
Will you guys watch it?
You're gonna hurt somebody.

434
00:30:28,856 --> 00:30:34,278
Hey! Eric Von Zipper likes you!

435
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:37,798
And when Eric Von Zipper likes
somebody, they stay liked.

436
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:41,415
Hey, I think I heard about you,
the creature from the black lagoon.

437
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:44,479
- You, I don't like.
- Yeah. You, he don't like.

438
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,703
- And who are you?
- J.D.

439
00:30:46,704 --> 00:30:49,966
Yeah. That's short
for juvenile delinquent.

440
00:30:49,967 --> 00:30:52,518
Later you will get the Rats' revenge.

441
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:55,598
Right now, I wanna talk to you.

442
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:57,734
You are my idol.

443
00:30:57,735 --> 00:31:01,654
I seen your picture in the paper
and I read your article.

444
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:08,950
J.D., he read me your article.
But I loved it.

445
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:10,846
Look who's on your side.

446
00:31:10,847 --> 00:31:12,861
I seen your picture, too.

447
00:31:14,728 --> 00:31:16,431
Clyde, quiet!

448
00:31:16,432 --> 00:31:18,391
You know, what you said
about them surfers is right.

449
00:31:18,392 --> 00:31:20,174
They are bums.

450
00:31:20,175 --> 00:31:21,982
And we are gonna
stamp them out together

451
00:31:21,983 --> 00:31:24,678
'cause the surfers is the natural
enemies of the Rats and Mice.

452
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:26,102
- Right?
- Right.

453
00:31:26,103 --> 00:31:29,190
- Surfers is giving us a bad name. Right?
- Right.

454
00:31:29,191 --> 00:31:32,078
You and me, we're a team,
and we're gonna destroy them.

455
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:33,655
Together, with violence!

456
00:31:33,656 --> 00:31:36,582
Well, I had in mind something
of a more legal nature.

457
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:38,686
You see? Everybody likes you.

458
00:31:38,687 --> 00:31:41,798
You got friends,
and we're gonna stick by you.

459
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:43,998
What is that bit about
water seeking its own level?

460
00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:46,534
Birds of a feather and all that.

461
00:31:46,535 --> 00:31:51,638
Sir, I consider you a member
of the lower classes.

462
00:31:51,639 --> 00:31:53,318
You're right.
How'd you know that?

463
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:56,014
You know, I went all the way
through the third grade.

464
00:31:56,015 --> 00:31:57,462
You are my idol.

465
00:31:57,463 --> 00:32:00,365
And you know something?
The Rats and Mice are behind you.

466
00:32:00,366 --> 00:32:03,732
And now, Eric Von Zipper is hungry.

467
00:32:03,733 --> 00:32:07,460
- What would you like?
- I don't know.

468
00:32:07,461 --> 00:32:09,780
Like, maybe a bird sandwich.

469
00:32:09,781 --> 00:32:14,405
No! I’ll get you salami.
it’ll be 70 cents.

470
00:32:14,406 --> 00:32:15,981
Hey, I don't think
you understand me.

471
00:32:15,982 --> 00:32:19,284
Eric Von Zipper don't buy.
He takes.

472
00:32:19,285 --> 00:32:21,884
That's not nice.
I think I’m closed.

473
00:32:21,885 --> 00:32:24,468
You are push me too far.

474
00:32:24,469 --> 00:32:27,168
Now you get the Rats' revenge.

475
00:32:29,389 --> 00:32:33,220
- No, but wait. But, but, but.
- No buts!

476
00:32:33,221 --> 00:32:35,388
- You gonna hit him, boss?
- Yeah, I’m gonna hit him.

477
00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:38,932
But, but, but!
No, no! Help!

478
00:32:38,933 --> 00:32:41,446
Are you...
Hold his mouth, too.

479
00:32:42,469 --> 00:32:44,872
Now, you hold his bird.

480
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,548
Well?

481
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,236
He's got a very nasty bird, boss.

482
00:32:49,237 --> 00:32:53,076
- Well, then, just forget it.
- That's some pal you have.

483
00:32:53,077 --> 00:32:55,518
Just hold him now.
Just hold him.

484
00:32:55,877 --> 00:32:58,228
- What, what, what?
- Unhand this man, sir!

485
00:32:58,229 --> 00:33:00,293
Tell your Rats I don't want
this gentleman molested.

486
00:33:00,294 --> 00:33:01,477
Release him this instant.

487
00:33:01,478 --> 00:33:07,180
You may be my idol, but nobody,
nobody tells Eric Von Zipper nothing.

488
00:33:07,181 --> 00:33:10,044
You see, as long as
the Finger ain't here,

489
00:33:10,045 --> 00:33:12,644
Eric Von Zipper is the king.

490
00:33:12,645 --> 00:33:13,732
Who is the Finger?

491
00:33:13,733 --> 00:33:16,581
- There was a fellow here last year.
- Professor-type fellow.

492
00:33:16,582 --> 00:33:18,900
- And he made with the finger.
- Called it a technique.

493
00:33:18,901 --> 00:33:21,182
- Yeah. Something like the Hima...
- Layan.

494
00:33:21,183 --> 00:33:24,710
Layan. Himalayan
suspenders technique.

495
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,911
Very potent type of
Zen karate thing.

496
00:33:26,912 --> 00:33:29,334
Yeah, what he used to do,
he used to take his finger, see?

497
00:33:29,335 --> 00:33:30,986
- And he would put it by my head...
- Watch it, boss.

498
00:33:30,987 --> 00:33:32,666
Don't worry.
I ain't gonna do it.

499
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:33,850
See, he would take his finger,

500
00:33:33,851 --> 00:33:36,827
but you had to have a special kind
of brain for this. See? And I have one.

501
00:33:36,828 --> 00:33:39,067
He would take his finger and he
would put it alongside my brain,

502
00:33:39,068 --> 00:33:41,172
and then he would push it and...

503
00:33:41,173 --> 00:33:44,128
The boss did it again.
He gave himself the finger.

504
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:49,272
- I think he stripped his clutch again.
- Hey, boss.

505
00:33:51,966 --> 00:33:54,332
Get this stiff out of here.

506
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:58,036
When Big Drag speaks, he commands.
Away, away!

507
00:33:58,037 --> 00:33:59,660
Frieda, are you all right?

508
00:34:00,549 --> 00:34:02,813
Gently, gently. Don't break him.

509
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:08,869
And stay out!

510
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:11,364
Von Zipper will return with an army!

511
00:34:11,365 --> 00:34:14,380
- I think I'm gonna like you, Harvey.
- Why?

512
00:34:14,381 --> 00:34:17,264
With him for a friend,
you don't need me for an enemy.

513
00:34:33,557 --> 00:34:35,516
They call that drag racing?

514
00:34:35,517 --> 00:34:37,565
I don't see them dragging nothing.

515
00:34:37,566 --> 00:34:39,669
Man, you sure you wanna
go for this bit?

516
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:42,700
Yeah, Johnny. I’m gonna go for this bit.
I’m gonna go all the way.

517
00:34:42,701 --> 00:34:45,524
The winner, Dave Wilkins
in his scalloper.

518
00:34:45,525 --> 00:34:51,571
Time, 8. 10 seconds
at 188.66 miles per hour.

519
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:13,997
It’s the Potato Bug! Hi!

520
00:35:37,998 --> 00:35:40,117
He acts like he owns
the whole world.

521
00:35:40,118 --> 00:35:43,164
Hey, there! What time do
you leave for the moon, Bug?

522
00:35:43,165 --> 00:35:44,724
Oh, jolly good.

523
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:47,077
Your frankfurter has come
to see me perform.

524
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:48,822
He's a chipper sport, he is.

525
00:35:48,823 --> 00:35:51,623
Must be a bit of English
blood there, I say.

526
00:35:51,624 --> 00:35:55,078
I have the feeling he's here
to check on my performance.

527
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:57,430
I wonder what she sees in that
fugitive from a barbershop.

528
00:35:57,431 --> 00:35:59,910
Those rails are all
smoke and noise, man.

529
00:35:59,911 --> 00:36:01,254
Hi there..

530
00:36:01,255 --> 00:36:03,672
It’s a great honor to
have you here, Mr. Bug.

531
00:36:04,669 --> 00:36:07,478
Sorry I couldn't meet you, but
I thought I'd clean up a bit.

532
00:36:07,479 --> 00:36:10,831
I own this place.
I’m Big Drag.

533
00:36:10,832 --> 00:36:12,398
Well, it's a pleasure
to know you, Mr. Drag.

534
00:36:12,399 --> 00:36:14,574
- Absolutely top hole.
- Yeah.

535
00:36:14,575 --> 00:36:17,110
Well, you can call me Big, Potato.

536
00:36:17,111 --> 00:36:20,142
- And you can call him Mr. Bug.
- Oh.

537
00:36:20,143 --> 00:36:23,934
The reason I’m here, old chap,
is that I want to try out my new rail

538
00:36:23,935 --> 00:36:26,110
and have a shot at your
world record, you know.

539
00:36:26,111 --> 00:36:28,055
What is that?

540
00:36:28,056 --> 00:36:30,454
It’s England's revenge
for the Boston Tea Party.

541
00:36:30,455 --> 00:36:33,886
Well, are you about set, Potato?
I mean, Mr. Bug.

542
00:36:33,887 --> 00:36:35,886
I’d be crackers if
I weren't, old boy.

543
00:36:35,887 --> 00:36:37,542
Be at the ready at
all times, you see.

544
00:36:37,543 --> 00:36:41,175
Carry on regardless and
all that sort of rot.

545
00:36:41,176 --> 00:36:43,639
He sure looks good
in that silver suit, though.

546
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,005
Yeah. I wonder how he'd
look in that ambulance?

547
00:36:47,527 --> 00:36:58,983
Then, we're off and sailing, eh?

548
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:00,902
Yeah. I’ll go shine up a trophy.

549
00:37:04,553 --> 00:37:06,984
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.</i>

550
00:37:06,985 --> 00:37:10,432
<i>As a surprise attraction,
Peter Royce Bentley,</i>

551
00:37:10,433 --> 00:37:12,376
<i>better known as the Potato Bug,</i>

552
00:37:12,377 --> 00:37:16,503
will attempt to break his world record
for the quarter-mile drag.

553
00:37:35,105 --> 00:37:36,696
It’s a bird.

554
00:37:36,697 --> 00:37:39,727
It’s a hunk of iron.
Anybody could handle that.

555
00:37:43,617 --> 00:37:45,536
Friends, gang! Listen to this!

556
00:37:45,537 --> 00:37:50,640
<i>The time, 7.9 seconds,
202.3 miles per hour!</i>

557
00:37:50,641 --> 00:37:52,273
A new world record!

558
00:38:06,793 --> 00:38:09,039
Here's your trophy, Mr. Bug.

559
00:38:10,425 --> 00:38:13,304
See where I signed it? Big Drag.

560
00:38:13,305 --> 00:38:15,048
Oh, jolly decent of you, Big.

561
00:38:15,049 --> 00:38:18,217
- Here, ducks. It’s all for you, love.
- But I didn't do anything.

562
00:38:18,218 --> 00:38:21,912
You might have to.
That's a loving cup, you know.

563
00:38:21,913 --> 00:38:25,088
Well, that sounds like a good idea.
Only it should come from him.

564
00:38:25,089 --> 00:38:26,768
Good, oh. Good, oh.

565
00:38:26,769 --> 00:38:30,024
Congratulations,
and I’d like to challenge you.

566
00:38:30,025 --> 00:38:32,306
You josh.
I wouldn't if I were you.

567
00:38:32,307 --> 00:38:34,650
I’d simply carry on
with those surfing sticks

568
00:38:34,651 --> 00:38:36,202
you frankfurters are so fond of.

569
00:38:36,203 --> 00:38:37,499
I mean it.

570
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,355
When I’m ready, I want to race you.

571
00:38:39,356 --> 00:38:41,635
Good show. I like
that sort of spirit.

572
00:38:41,636 --> 00:38:43,882
Simply toss me the gauntlet
when you're ready

573
00:38:43,883 --> 00:38:45,657
and we'll have a go at it.
You see?

574
00:38:48,931 --> 00:38:50,962
Will everyone please
clear the track?

575
00:38:50,963 --> 00:38:54,434
We have a new contestant,
a mystery driver.

576
00:38:54,435 --> 00:38:58,585
Oh, well, it's off to tidy up a bit.
Later, ducks, eh?

577
00:39:28,604 --> 00:39:32,162
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the Potato Bug's
record has just been broken!</i>

578
00:39:32,163 --> 00:39:34,986
<i>The mystery driver set
a new record!</i>

579
00:39:34,987 --> 00:39:39,984
<i>Time, 7.1 seconds at
203 miles per hour!</i>

580
00:39:42,668 --> 00:39:45,360
Now, Miss Clements,
one moment please.

581
00:40:01,307 --> 00:40:02,738
Excuse me.

582
00:40:02,739 --> 00:40:05,493
I have something I
wish to show you.

583
00:40:05,494 --> 00:40:07,788
I’m not so sure
I want to see it.

584
00:40:07,789 --> 00:40:09,925
You are the new champ, sir.

585
00:40:13,581 --> 00:40:16,073
I got that feeling again.

586
00:40:18,726 --> 00:40:21,517
There's a monkey suit
with a real monkey in it.

587
00:40:21,518 --> 00:40:25,572
Hold it. Hold it.
Hold it.

588
00:40:25,573 --> 00:40:26,372
There you are.

589
00:40:28,581 --> 00:40:31,760
It’s like Frankie said,
anybody can learn to drive one.

590
00:40:52,089 --> 00:40:54,684
<i>What were you trying to do?
Make monkeys out of us?</i>

591
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:58,292
You think we ain't got honor?
You think we ain't got dignity?

592
00:40:58,293 --> 00:41:01,148
Well, no offense, sir.
I’m just trying to prove a theory of mine.

593
00:41:01,149 --> 00:41:02,356
This is an insult.

594
00:41:02,357 --> 00:41:04,149
Would you like to have
your picture taken, sir?

595
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,613
For the front page of the newspaper?

596
00:41:06,614 --> 00:41:08,205
- For the paper?
- Yes.

597
00:41:08,206 --> 00:41:10,679
- A picture of me?
- Yes.

598
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,111
- With him?
- Yeah.

599
00:41:12,112 --> 00:41:14,345
- I’ll buy that.
- Oh, that's fine.

600
00:41:17,231 --> 00:41:19,222
Now, just you put
your arm around him.

601
00:41:19,223 --> 00:41:23,570
Very friendly. Oh, boy, that's right.
Oh, that's wonderful.

602
00:41:24,584 --> 00:41:25,897
There we are.

603
00:41:29,759 --> 00:41:32,718
Well, my dear.
What do you think now?

604
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:34,550
So you taught a monkey to drive.

605
00:41:34,551 --> 00:41:37,447
But he didn't build the machine.
He didn't create anything.

606
00:41:37,448 --> 00:41:38,751
But I did.

607
00:41:38,752 --> 00:41:42,030
I created the impression
that teenagers live in a simian world.

608
00:41:42,031 --> 00:41:45,790
And I believe I created some doubt
in your mind. Isn't that right?

609
00:41:45,791 --> 00:41:47,699
Only of your sanity.

610
00:41:51,245 --> 00:41:55,260
Excuse me, but I’d like to talk to
someone about getting myself a rail.

611
00:41:55,261 --> 00:41:56,669
That's me. Big Drag.

612
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:58,957
You better ask him about learning
how to drive one of those things, too.

613
00:41:58,958 --> 00:42:02,404
- Yeah. He wants to be a drag, like you.
- You've come to the right place.

614
00:42:02,405 --> 00:42:04,572
- How much money do you have?
- 100 bucks.

615
00:42:04,573 --> 00:42:06,396
100 bucks?

616
00:42:06,397 --> 00:42:08,897
I can let you have
this for 100 bucks.

617
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:13,765
- Well, maybe we could fix it up.
- Oh, I don't know.

618
00:42:13,766 --> 00:42:15,653
Well, I gotta be fair about this.

619
00:42:15,654 --> 00:42:17,892
Something I should tell you
before you buy it.

620
00:42:17,893 --> 00:42:19,524
The brakes pull bad to the left.

621
00:42:19,525 --> 00:42:21,708
The steering wheel's loose
and the clutch slips.

622
00:42:21,709 --> 00:42:23,484
And you need two new rear tires.

623
00:42:23,485 --> 00:42:25,228
And you shouldn't pull
out the choke.

624
00:42:25,229 --> 00:42:28,973
- Why not?
- Because it releases the parachute.

625
00:42:28,974 --> 00:42:30,869
Now, look.
Doesn't anything work on this car?

626
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:32,372
The radio's kind of nice.

627
00:42:32,373 --> 00:42:34,588
Maybe somebody could loan me a
rail or I could rent one.

628
00:42:34,589 --> 00:42:37,196
Hey, you look like a
fellow I used to know.

629
00:42:37,197 --> 00:42:40,972
- His name was Jack something.
- Yeah. I used to be Jack Fanny.

630
00:42:40,973 --> 00:42:43,773
had a string of musclemen
whose muscle was mainly in their heads.

631
00:42:43,774 --> 00:42:46,765
But I got out of the fanny business.
That's all behind me now.

632
00:42:46,766 --> 00:42:49,148
I can show you a model
over here you might like.

633
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,684
This is a rail.

634
00:42:50,685 --> 00:42:52,996
It’s not a rail
like you think a rail should be.

635
00:42:52,997 --> 00:42:56,532
It’s a rail because
it's the principle of motorocity.

636
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:59,629
Now, let me give you a few
of the basic principles of motorocity.

637
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:01,317
Which is the wheel?

638
00:43:01,318 --> 00:43:04,604
The wheel is round, as you see.

639
00:43:04,605 --> 00:43:07,876
The reason the wheel is round,
is that round wheels are round,

640
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:10,268
and the rounder the wheel, the better.

641
00:43:10,269 --> 00:43:12,628
They're the best kind, you know.

642
00:43:12,629 --> 00:43:16,333
Since a long time ago,
we discovered that square wheels

643
00:43:17,566 --> 00:43:19,172
didn't work well.

644
00:43:19,173 --> 00:43:24,825
So you see, squares are squares
and wheels are wheelers.

645
00:43:24,826 --> 00:43:27,808
Now, when we think wheel,
we think round.

646
00:43:27,809 --> 00:43:30,512
- Have I made myself clear?
- Yeah.

647
00:43:30,513 --> 00:43:33,720
Well, how come they call
that thing a rail?

648
00:43:33,721 --> 00:43:36,088
You don't understand
English, do you?

649
00:43:36,089 --> 00:43:39,889
All that greasy kids' stuff
has softened his brain.

650
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:42,571
- Would you like a demonstration?
- Yeah.

651
00:43:42,572 --> 00:43:44,864
Come on.

652
00:43:44,865 --> 00:43:47,280
Roll it out.
Roll it out.

653
00:44:01,249 --> 00:44:02,976
It’s the wrangler stretch!

654
00:44:17,737 --> 00:44:21,192
Oh, I say, this is
a jolly good show.

655
00:44:21,193 --> 00:44:23,281
The entire establishment is leaping!

656
00:44:25,282 --> 00:44:28,209
- Is that how one puts it, my dear?
- You're close.

657
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:31,300
The translation is,
"The joint is jumping."

658
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:34,537
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
Good show. Good show.

659
00:44:41,629 --> 00:44:44,471
- Clyde likes it.
- I’m happy for him.

660
00:44:51,916 --> 00:44:56,725
And now I take great pride
in proudly presenting The Pyramids.

661
00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:15,420
Looks like a bug,
laughs like a hyena.

662
00:45:18,421 --> 00:45:21,212
<i>Well, they all stand up
as he idles by</i>

663
00:45:21,213 --> 00:45:23,608
<i>Gonna cheer him on
for the record try</i>

664
00:45:23,609 --> 00:45:26,192
<i>Best rails here from
every state now</i>

665
00:45:26,193 --> 00:45:29,040
<i>Everyone knows
the competition's great now</i>

666
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:32,945
<i>Record run, record run</i>

667
00:45:32,946 --> 00:45:36,336
Pardon me, lady.
Miss Bug?

668
00:45:36,337 --> 00:45:39,544
Would you care to hit the boards
with little old Deadhead?

669
00:45:39,545 --> 00:45:41,368
Merci, Monsieur Head.

670
00:45:41,369 --> 00:45:43,945
It seems to be one of
your native dances.

671
00:45:43,946 --> 00:45:45,272
You will have to teach me.

672
00:45:45,273 --> 00:45:48,649
Yeah, yeah. I’d just love
to go native with you.

673
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:55,048
<i>Record run, record run,
record run</i>

674
00:45:55,049 --> 00:45:58,579
Enjoy. Enjoy, love.
Hurry back.

675
00:46:08,257 --> 00:46:10,368
The music of the youth of today
is straight out of the jungle.

676
00:46:10,369 --> 00:46:12,801
<i>The tree is green
there isn't any doubt</i>

677
00:46:12,802 --> 00:46:14,624
<i>We're gonna see...</i>

678
00:46:14,625 --> 00:46:16,416
The savage music that stimulates

679
00:46:16,417 --> 00:46:18,945
their post-adolescent
preoccupation with sex.

680
00:46:18,946 --> 00:46:21,120
You sure love that three letter word.

681
00:46:21,121 --> 00:46:25,000
<i>Record run, record run</i>

682
00:46:25,001 --> 00:46:27,161
These children
are nothing more than animals.

683
00:46:27,162 --> 00:46:29,336
Come off it, Harvey.
They're having fun.

684
00:46:29,337 --> 00:46:32,048
"Fun", now, that's a three-letter word
I bet you never heard of.

685
00:46:32,049 --> 00:46:36,104
- Come on, let's join them.
- I’m here strictly as an observer.

686
00:46:36,105 --> 00:46:39,497
I have a feeling
you've always been an observer.

687
00:46:39,498 --> 00:46:42,033
Let's not be vulgar.

688
00:46:42,034 --> 00:46:44,529
I think I’m gonna ask Clyde to dance.
At least he's enjoying himself.

689
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:47,640
Well, of course he is.
Everything here is down to his level.

690
00:46:47,641 --> 00:46:50,216
If he's having such a good time,
maybe we should give him a real treat.

691
00:46:50,217 --> 00:46:53,083
I bet he'd go ape at
the Coconut Grove.

692
00:47:07,417 --> 00:47:09,385
Hey!

693
00:47:13,386 --> 00:47:15,513
Well, you got no worries now.

694
00:47:15,514 --> 00:47:18,248
Eric Von Zipper is right with you
to protect you

695
00:47:18,249 --> 00:47:20,848
in case them beach bums
give you any trouble.

696
00:47:20,849 --> 00:47:23,304
I don't know how you
got so lucky, Harvey.

697
00:47:23,305 --> 00:47:25,824
Yeah. Oh, by the way,
I want to apologize.

698
00:47:25,825 --> 00:47:29,104
I’m sorry I was not out at the
drag strip to protect you today,

699
00:47:29,105 --> 00:47:32,440
but I just woke up
from that Himalayan suspenders trance.

700
00:47:32,441 --> 00:47:36,104
- Really? How can you tell?
- Oh, it's easy.

701
00:47:36,105 --> 00:47:38,928
See, every time
I give myself the finger... Oh!

702
00:47:38,929 --> 00:47:43,296
I better not, 'cause I gotta keep
my mentality on the alert to protect you,

703
00:47:43,297 --> 00:47:46,633
'cause you are my idol.

704
00:47:46,634 --> 00:47:50,632
What? Oh! Hello, Clyde.
Nice to see you again.

705
00:47:50,633 --> 00:47:52,144
You know something, Clyde?

706
00:47:52,145 --> 00:47:55,699
I could get to like you
'cause you're my kind of people.

707
00:47:57,929 --> 00:48:02,481
You shouldn't have said that.
He's very sensitive.

708
00:48:02,482 --> 00:48:04,644
Oh. Oh, I... I'm sorry, Clyde.

709
00:48:05,209 --> 00:48:08,640
Well, nothing to worry about.
I’ll be right over there with my rat pack

710
00:48:08,641 --> 00:48:09,680
in case you need any help.

711
00:48:09,681 --> 00:48:12,102
You are my idol.

712
00:48:21,737 --> 00:48:23,864
Beach bunnies, surfers and dragsters,

713
00:48:23,865 --> 00:48:27,152
it gives me great pleasure
to give you great pleasure.

714
00:48:27,153 --> 00:48:30,816
Big Drag is proud to say
that right here in the middle of our midst

715
00:48:30,817 --> 00:48:33,040
is a famous, well-known celebrity.

716
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:35,552
I guess you all know
who I’m talking about.

717
00:48:35,553 --> 00:48:36,960
We want Potato Bug!
We want Potato Bug!

718
00:48:36,961 --> 00:48:43,889
We want Potato Bug!
We want Potato Bug!

719
00:48:44,009 --> 00:48:49,807
By George, this is jolly good of you.
Makes me feel super, don't you know!

720
00:48:52,537 --> 00:48:55,137
This is an unexpected pleasure
we didn't expect, Mr. Bug.

721
00:48:55,138 --> 00:48:57,129
I’ll put it in my memory book
if I don't forget.

722
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:58,885
Thank you, old sport!

723
00:49:01,106 --> 00:49:03,336
<i>- Ooh!
- How about that?</i>

724
00:49:03,337 --> 00:49:10,456
<i>- Ooh!
- How about that?</i>

725
00:49:10,457 --> 00:49:12,944
<i>- Hey, you've got lips
- How about that?</i>

726
00:49:12,945 --> 00:49:15,601
<i>And those lips they
need kissing</i>

727
00:49:15,602 --> 00:49:20,248
<i>Hey, little girl,
how about kissing me? Ooh!</i>

728
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:22,576
<i>- You got love.
- How about that?</i>

729
00:49:22,577 --> 00:49:25,296
<i>And your love I’ve been missing</i>

730
00:49:25,297 --> 00:49:28,520
<i>Hey, little girl,
how about loving me?</i>

731
00:49:28,521 --> 00:49:30,449
<i>- How about that?
- Ooh!</i>

732
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:32,745
<i>I’ve been waiting a long,
long time</i>

733
00:49:32,746 --> 00:49:35,352
<i>For a little girl like you</i>

734
00:49:35,353 --> 00:49:37,960
<i>Now at last you're
gonna be mine</i>

735
00:49:37,961 --> 00:49:41,657
<i>Tell you what I’m
gonna do, ooh</i>

736
00:49:41,658 --> 00:49:44,169
<i>- I love you
- How about that?</i>

737
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:46,896
<i>All my love I’ll be giving</i>

738
00:49:46,897 --> 00:49:50,032
<i>Hey, little girl,
how about loving me, too?</i>

739
00:49:50,033 --> 00:49:52,216
<i>- How about that?
- Ooh.</i>

740
00:49:52,217 --> 00:49:54,768
<i>Ooh</i>

741
00:50:03,179 --> 00:50:06,722
<i>How about that?</i>

742
00:50:11,793 --> 00:50:13,952
<i>I’ve been waiting
a long, long time</i>

743
00:50:13,953 --> 00:50:16,529
<i>For a little girl like you</i>

744
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:19,089
<i>Now at last you're
gonna be mine</i>

745
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:22,856
<i>Tell you what I’m gonna do</i>

746
00:50:22,857 --> 00:50:25,216
<i>Tell you what I’m gonna do</i>

747
00:50:25,217 --> 00:50:28,048
<i>All my love I’ll be giving</i>

748
00:50:28,049 --> 00:50:31,104
<i>Hey, little girl,
you're the girl for me</i>

749
00:50:31,105 --> 00:50:32,962
<i>How about that?</i>

750
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:35,944
<i>Hey, little girl,
you're the girl for me</i>

751
00:50:35,945 --> 00:50:37,808
<i>- How about that?
- Ooh!</i>

752
00:50:37,809 --> 00:50:40,944
<i>Hey, little girl,
you're the girl for me</i>

753
00:50:40,945 --> 00:50:43,200
<i>How about that?</i>

754
00:50:43,201 --> 00:50:44,958
- How about that?
- Ooh

755
00:50:52,945 --> 00:50:56,136
Good girl. Good girl.
Yes. Quite spunky.

756
00:50:56,137 --> 00:50:58,352
He's got a head like Gibraltar.

757
00:50:58,353 --> 00:51:00,368
Yes, quite stylish, too. Yes.

758
00:51:00,369 --> 00:51:01,360
So don't worry, Frankie

759
00:51:01,361 --> 00:51:03,657
A guy like you,
you get another chick like that.

760
00:51:03,658 --> 00:51:06,201
- Yeah, that's right.
- Not at this table.

761
00:51:06,202 --> 00:51:07,744
Look, Johnny, I don't
want another chick.

762
00:51:07,745 --> 00:51:09,520
- I don't want anything.
- Hey, I’m with you.

763
00:51:09,521 --> 00:51:11,448
That way you don't have to
take a chick to dances.

764
00:51:11,449 --> 00:51:13,104
You don't have to find
a place to smooch.

765
00:51:13,105 --> 00:51:16,295
And you don't have to think about
what we're always thinking about.

766
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:19,487
Hey. What am I saying?

767
00:51:37,577 --> 00:51:39,088
Would you two like to be alone?

768
00:52:11,089 --> 00:52:12,400
Look, here comes creep.

769
00:52:12,401 --> 00:52:14,401
Frieda, keep a civil
tongue in your beak.

770
00:52:24,402 --> 00:52:26,520
How many times do I
have to tell you, sir?

771
00:52:26,521 --> 00:52:28,568
My art has no price on it.

772
00:52:28,569 --> 00:52:30,840
I mean, it's priceless.

773
00:52:44,769 --> 00:52:47,210
- Ain't this spiffy?
- Yeah.

774
00:53:12,417 --> 00:53:14,624
I think I’ll lower the bridge
on London town.

775
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:18,304
Hold it. What he's doing,
you can do better.

776
00:53:18,305 --> 00:53:20,913
- Yeah.
- But if I’m wrong, don't blame me.

777
00:53:20,914 --> 00:53:22,423
Thanks a lot.

778
00:53:23,746 --> 00:53:26,505
- Dee Dee, I want to talk to you.
- Go ahead and talk.

779
00:53:26,506 --> 00:53:28,568
I mean alone.

780
00:53:28,569 --> 00:53:30,192
Sorry, old chap. But I’d
like to take Dee Dee home.

781
00:53:30,193 --> 00:53:32,888
Oh, I think it would be a spiffing idea
if you two were to reconcile.

782
00:53:32,889 --> 00:53:36,113
Though I must admit I’ve become
quite attached to your young lady.

783
00:53:36,114 --> 00:53:38,241
Double drats, I believe
the word is "poultry."

784
00:53:38,242 --> 00:53:39,681
You mean, "chick."

785
00:53:39,682 --> 00:53:41,665
Are you sure it's
all right, Potato?

786
00:53:41,666 --> 00:53:42,904
Oh, first names.

787
00:53:42,905 --> 00:53:45,200
Oh, it's top hole.
Only sporting thing to do.

788
00:53:45,201 --> 00:53:47,192
Give the young man a chance
to display his charms.

789
00:53:47,193 --> 00:53:48,984
Test them against mine,
that sort of thing.

790
00:53:48,985 --> 00:53:51,720
Yeah, yeah, come on, Dee Dee.
Let's get out of here..

791
00:53:51,721 --> 00:53:53,835
He's a rude bugger, he is.

792
00:53:56,202 --> 00:53:58,260
It’s Watusi time!

793
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:06,515
Now, Clyde.

794
00:54:10,516 --> 00:54:13,475
<i>I got you where I want you
I want you where I got you</i>

795
00:54:13,476 --> 00:54:16,307
<i>You're never gonna
get away from me</i>

796
00:54:16,308 --> 00:54:19,210
<i>I want you where I got you
I got you where I want you</i>

797
00:54:19,211 --> 00:54:22,010
<i>There's no one else
around but you and me</i>

798
00:54:22,011 --> 00:54:25,082
<i>We got plenty of time
They won't be home until nine</i>

799
00:54:25,083 --> 00:54:28,906
<i>I got you all to
myself until then</i>

800
00:54:28,907 --> 00:54:31,259
Clyde's people
invented the Watusi.

801
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,623
Sure, they were the
original swingers.

802
00:54:35,491 --> 00:54:38,370
<i>I got you where I want you
I want you where I got you</i>

803
00:54:38,371 --> 00:54:41,298
<i>You're never gonna get
away from me</i>

804
00:54:41,299 --> 00:54:44,195
<i>I want you where I got you
I got you where I want you</i>

805
00:54:44,196 --> 00:54:47,175
<i>There's no one else
around but you and me</i>

806
00:54:56,675 --> 00:55:00,155
Now, wait. Hold it.
Stop the music! Stop everything!

807
00:55:00,156 --> 00:55:03,930
Now, wait a second. Wait a second.
This has got to stop.

808
00:55:03,931 --> 00:55:05,562
What kind of a place
do you think I’m running?

809
00:55:05,563 --> 00:55:07,386
Well, I’d rather not
answer that, Mr. Drag.

810
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:10,986
Would you like to have your
picture taken for the newspaper?

811
00:55:10,987 --> 00:55:14,074
- Again?
- Yeah.

812
00:55:14,075 --> 00:55:16,918
- Oh, I suppose you need the circulation.
- Yeah.

813
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:20,317
- Would you like to...
- No, no. We won't need you.

814
00:55:21,891 --> 00:55:23,938
There we are. Here you are, Clyde.

815
00:55:23,939 --> 00:55:26,634
That's right. Thank you, sir.
Come along, Clyde.

816
00:55:29,435 --> 00:55:32,306
Oh, excellent, Clyde. Excellent.

817
00:55:32,307 --> 00:55:34,010
Time we went along, my dear.

818
00:55:34,011 --> 00:55:35,242
Tomorrow morning's editorial

819
00:55:35,243 --> 00:55:37,050
is going to be an eye-opener
for the entire community.

820
00:55:37,051 --> 00:55:38,914
I’m waiting for your eyes to open.

821
00:55:38,915 --> 00:55:40,931
He's a sweetheart of a guy.

822
00:55:50,179 --> 00:55:52,243
It’s beautiful, isn't it?

823
00:55:53,403 --> 00:55:56,949
You know, this is the first time the day's
been quiet enough to hear the waves.

824
00:55:58,435 --> 00:56:01,875
I’m sorry I took you
away from your date.

825
00:56:01,876 --> 00:56:03,722
I didn't mean to.

826
00:56:03,723 --> 00:56:05,954
You didn't?

827
00:56:05,955 --> 00:56:09,138
All right, I did. But I don't
blame you for liking the Bug.

828
00:56:09,139 --> 00:56:11,987
- For one thing, he's famous.
- Yes.

829
00:56:11,988 --> 00:56:14,371
- And he's rich.
- Yes.

830
00:56:14,372 --> 00:56:16,773
And all the girls go ape
when they see him.

831
00:56:18,411 --> 00:56:22,661
- Then why are you walking here with me?
- Because you're you.

832
00:56:27,795 --> 00:56:32,203
<i>Every time you hold me</i>

833
00:56:32,204 --> 00:56:36,618
<i>I know it's real</i>

834
00:56:36,619 --> 00:56:41,082
<i>My heart once told me</i>

835
00:56:41,083 --> 00:56:45,018
<i>How it would feel</i>

836
00:56:45,019 --> 00:56:47,339
<i>Why?</i>

837
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:49,706
<i>Just like you told me</i>

838
00:56:49,707 --> 00:56:51,858
<i>Why?</i>

839
00:56:51,859 --> 00:56:54,282
<i>Each time you hold me</i>

840
00:56:54,283 --> 00:56:58,154
<i>Why?</i>

841
00:56:58,155 --> 00:57:04,346
<i>Because you're you</i>

842
00:57:04,347 --> 00:57:08,946
<i>Every time I’m near you</i>

843
00:57:08,947 --> 00:57:13,666
<i>Stars from the skies</i>

844
00:57:13,667 --> 00:57:18,211
<i>Somehow appear to</i>

845
00:57:18,212 --> 00:57:21,979
<i>Shine in your eyes</i>

846
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,226
<i>Why?</i>

847
00:57:24,227 --> 00:57:26,978
<i>They just appear to</i>

848
00:57:26,979 --> 00:57:28,786
<i>Why?</i>

849
00:57:28,787 --> 00:57:31,826
<i>Each time I’m near you</i>

850
00:57:31,827 --> 00:57:34,866
<i>Why?</i>

851
00:57:34,867 --> 00:57:41,354
<i>Because you're you</i>

852
00:57:41,355 --> 00:57:45,835
<i>Every time we kiss now</i>

853
00:57:45,836 --> 00:57:50,443
<i>It’s plain to see</i>

854
00:57:50,444 --> 00:57:54,914
<i>So sure of this now</i>

855
00:57:54,915 --> 00:57:58,858
<i>You were meant for me</i>

856
00:57:58,859 --> 00:58:01,122
<i>Why?</i>

857
00:58:01,123 --> 00:58:04,099
<i>So sure of this now</i>

858
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,835
<i>Why?</i>

859
00:58:05,836 --> 00:58:08,690
<i>Each time we kiss now</i>

860
00:58:08,691 --> 00:58:11,690
<i>Why?</i>

861
00:58:11,691 --> 00:58:15,555
<i>Because you're you</i>

862
00:58:16,491 --> 00:58:19,835
<i>Because you're you</i>

863
00:58:21,388 --> 00:58:28,547
<i>Because you're you</i>

864
00:58:35,501 --> 00:58:37,057
Well, I’m glad everything's settled.

865
00:58:37,058 --> 00:58:40,265
Things are back to normal,
and we can just forget about drag racing.

866
00:58:40,514 --> 00:58:42,584
Hold it. Who said anything
about forgetting it?

867
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:44,440
I can't back out of that race.

868
00:58:44,441 --> 00:58:45,944
A man's got to stand by his word.

869
00:58:45,945 --> 00:58:48,032
I told him I’d race him,
and that's the way it's gotta be.

870
00:58:48,033 --> 00:58:50,481
Well, then he'll back out of it
because I’ll tell him to.

871
00:58:50,482 --> 00:58:53,217
You stay out of this.

872
00:58:53,218 --> 00:58:55,283
Anything you say, Frankie.

873
00:59:06,129 --> 00:59:10,513
And so I say, the best way to go forward

874
00:59:10,514 --> 00:59:13,008
is to borrow from the past.

875
00:59:13,009 --> 00:59:15,624
Return to that steady, reliable course

876
00:59:15,625 --> 00:59:18,304
charted for us by our forebears.

877
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:21,472
If it was good enough
for our fathers,

878
00:59:21,473 --> 00:59:24,785
and good enough for our grandfathers,

879
00:59:24,786 --> 00:59:27,080
then it follows
that it must be good enough...

880
00:59:27,081 --> 00:59:29,536
I’m sorry, Mr. Honeywagon.
I told her you were tied up.

881
00:59:29,537 --> 00:59:32,352
Tied up is too good for him.
He should be locked up.

882
00:59:32,353 --> 00:59:34,808
She never listens, Miss Simms,
but thanks for trying.

883
00:59:34,809 --> 00:59:36,792
I just finished today's article.
Would you like to read it?

884
00:59:36,793 --> 00:59:40,465
I didn't even read yesterday's.
I put it on the bottom of my canary's cage.

885
00:59:40,466 --> 00:59:42,600
- I resent that.
- He hated it.

886
00:59:42,601 --> 00:59:44,480
Harvey Honeywagon,
I’ve been doing some digging.

887
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:46,976
And I found out why you're putting
the knock on these kids.

888
00:59:46,977 --> 00:59:49,136
For purely moral reasons is why.

889
00:59:49,137 --> 00:59:51,497
For purely commercial reasons is why.

890
00:59:51,498 --> 00:59:53,409
You're trying to buy up
that beach property

891
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:55,545
so you can expand your OFH.

892
00:59:55,546 --> 00:59:59,240
- And what is "OFH"?
- Old folks' home.

893
00:59:59,241 --> 01:00:01,880
It is not an old folks' home!
It is Sea-Esta by the Sea!

894
01:00:01,881 --> 01:00:03,128
You mean, "Fee-esta."

895
01:00:03,129 --> 01:00:05,184
The fee is the only thing
you're interested in.

896
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:08,337
I am interested in protecting my residents
from an evil environment.

897
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:10,728
Sea-Esta by the Sea
is a resort for senior citizens,

898
01:00:10,729 --> 01:00:14,184
and I’m going to see to it that they get
the peace and quiet they so richly deserve.

899
01:00:14,185 --> 01:00:15,473
Well, they're getting it,
all right

900
01:00:15,474 --> 01:00:17,816
It’s more of a last
resort for them.

901
01:00:17,817 --> 01:00:19,504
All they do is sit and vegetate.

902
01:00:19,505 --> 01:00:22,644
Honeywagon's vegetable farm,
that's what you're running.

903
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:26,313
Now, that's really an insult.

904
01:00:26,314 --> 01:00:28,265
All I’m trying to do
is help these poor people

905
01:00:28,266 --> 01:00:29,664
who have been forced into retirement.

906
01:00:29,665 --> 01:00:32,451
You're helping them into their graves.
Why don't you furnish shovels?

907
01:00:32,452 --> 01:00:34,546
I’m only doing what I think
is proper and right.

908
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:36,994
Harvey Honeywagon,
you listen to me.

909
01:00:36,995 --> 01:00:39,066
You're holding a
double-barrel shotgun.

910
01:00:39,067 --> 01:00:42,026
Killing off the old folks while
you kill off the fun for the youngsters.

911
01:00:42,027 --> 01:00:45,299
I guess it never occurred to you that the...
beach is a place to live, not to die.

912
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:47,203
- Have you quite finished be...
- I’ve finished!

913
01:00:47,204 --> 01:00:50,184
And don't ask me to leave.
I’d rather it was my idea.

914
01:00:55,323 --> 01:00:57,592
You know, for a while there,
I was beginning to like you.

915
01:00:58,171 --> 01:01:01,419
Now I wish you'd take a room
at the vegetable farm and retire.

916
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:03,955
I’ll get the kids to take up a collection.

917
01:01:03,956 --> 01:01:05,850
We'll send you a shovel.

918
01:01:20,155 --> 01:01:23,026
Well, I’m just going to have to appeal
to the Potato Bug's sportsmanship.

919
01:01:23,027 --> 01:01:25,104
I bet he won't be as
stubborn as Frankie.

920
01:01:25,105 --> 01:01:28,241
Well, what's wrong with drag racing?
I think it's kind of groovy.

921
01:01:28,242 --> 01:01:30,657
Aren't surfboards fast enough
for you, Animal?

922
01:01:30,658 --> 01:01:33,192
No, and neither are the surfers.

923
01:01:33,193 --> 01:01:36,528
Would you trade that beautiful
ocean for a dirty old rail?

924
01:01:36,529 --> 01:01:38,112
Well, there's room for both.

925
01:01:38,113 --> 01:01:40,152
Not in my life.
Wish me luck.

926
01:01:40,153 --> 01:01:42,552
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.

927
01:01:42,553 --> 01:01:44,177
A little short in the back.

928
01:01:44,178 --> 01:01:46,865
- How do I look from the front?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

929
01:01:46,866 --> 01:01:48,856
You're the buggiest little Bug
I ever saw, from the front.

930
01:01:48,857 --> 01:01:52,005
- But don't let her get behind you.
- Okay.

931
01:01:55,385 --> 01:01:56,744
There she is.

932
01:01:56,745 --> 01:01:58,264
Well, wish me luck.

933
01:01:58,265 --> 01:02:01,342
- Good luck, Potato.
- Yeah.

934
01:02:04,505 --> 01:02:06,360
Hi, Potato.

935
01:02:06,361 --> 01:02:09,832
Oh, I say, this is a spot of luck,
by George, don't you know.

936
01:02:09,833 --> 01:02:13,248
Out for my evening stroll,
that sort of thing, and here you are.

937
01:02:13,249 --> 01:02:16,353
A bit of luck, indeed.
Ripping, actually.

938
01:02:16,354 --> 01:02:18,032
I was just on my way to see you.

939
01:02:18,033 --> 01:02:20,272
Oh, by George, and rather!

940
01:02:20,273 --> 01:02:23,368
A girl and her frankfurter
soon parted, so to speak.

941
01:02:23,369 --> 01:02:26,792
And one is quite flattered,
don't you know.

942
01:02:26,793 --> 01:02:28,328
Potato, do you feel all right?

943
01:02:28,329 --> 01:02:31,161
Oh, all right? Oh, yes, yes.

944
01:02:31,162 --> 01:02:33,921
A touch... Touch of sinus,
you know.

945
01:02:33,922 --> 01:02:37,056
You know, the sea.
And a stiff neck as well, yeah.

946
01:02:37,057 --> 01:02:39,424
Well, I was really coming over
to ask you for a favor.

947
01:02:39,425 --> 01:02:40,624
Now, what is it, love?

948
01:02:40,625 --> 01:02:44,624
Potato, I want you
to cancel the race with Frankie.

949
01:02:44,625 --> 01:02:48,201
Good heavens, girl, you josh!
You can't ask that!

950
01:02:48,202 --> 01:02:51,512
No. No. You can't ask an Englishman
to bend his word.

951
01:02:51,513 --> 01:02:54,224
And there's a bit more
to it than that, you know.

952
01:02:54,225 --> 01:02:56,712
I wouldn't mind having you for my bird.

953
01:02:56,713 --> 01:03:00,130
Well, you don't have to win the race
to win everything.

954
01:03:02,066 --> 01:03:04,424
Oh, yes. Yes.
There are other things.

955
01:03:04,425 --> 01:03:06,960
Indeed, there are.

956
01:03:06,961 --> 01:03:08,944
And, ducks, you're making me feel,
shall I say, frivolous.

957
01:03:08,945 --> 01:03:11,560
You know, fogging up the old glasses.

958
01:03:11,561 --> 01:03:14,464
- Potato, then you will cancel the race?
- Definitely not!

959
01:03:14,465 --> 01:03:17,192
A challenge is a challenge!

960
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:20,168
But here we are all alone, and...

961
01:03:20,169 --> 01:03:24,176
Can't you just forget about
everything else?

962
01:03:24,177 --> 01:03:25,329
Well, one is tempted, my dear.

963
01:03:25,330 --> 01:03:29,152
Especially when one is aware
of our proximity.

964
01:03:29,153 --> 01:03:31,072
- It’s you I love.
- Yeah.

965
01:03:31,073 --> 01:03:33,192
Are you really aware of that?

966
01:03:33,193 --> 01:03:35,521
Well, Englishmen are
not made of wood, my dear.

967
01:03:35,522 --> 01:03:40,192
We are well aware of the opposite sex,
have been for centuries.

968
01:03:40,193 --> 01:03:43,283
I’d just die if anything
happened to you

969
01:03:43,284 --> 01:03:44,052
Yeah.

970
01:03:44,553 --> 01:03:47,342
Well, you know, you can always
go back to your Frankie chap.

971
01:03:47,343 --> 01:03:50,518
It can't be all that bad.
He's really quite a good catch.

972
01:03:50,519 --> 01:03:53,406
And he sings better than I do,
actually, don't you know.

973
01:03:53,407 --> 01:03:56,855
You're just being gallant.
There's only one Potato Bug.

974
01:03:56,856 --> 01:03:59,046
Oh, well, I don't know that.

975
01:03:59,047 --> 01:04:07,502
My word, ducks! You seem to be wrong.
There appears to be two Potato Bugs.

976
01:04:07,503 --> 01:04:12,111
By Jove, I don't believe I’ve ever known
a wicket this sticky!

977
01:04:12,112 --> 01:04:15,591
I think I know which wicket
is the stickiest around here.

978
01:04:15,592 --> 01:04:17,318
Now, love. Now, ducks.

979
01:04:17,319 --> 01:04:20,622
You see, only our hairdressers
know for sure.

980
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:23,782
To think that you could stoop
to such a low-down trick!

981
01:04:23,783 --> 01:04:25,638
I never want to see you again!

982
01:04:25,639 --> 01:04:27,870
I should say not,
after those things you said to me.

983
01:04:27,871 --> 01:04:29,111
I mean, to him.

984
01:04:29,112 --> 01:04:30,615
Did you mean all that love junk?

985
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:33,390
- Wouldn't you like to know.
- Yes.

986
01:04:33,391 --> 01:04:37,246
I say there, you two.
Stow it, won't you?

987
01:04:37,247 --> 01:04:41,198
I have no idea what this is all about.
But one must cope.

988
01:04:41,199 --> 01:04:44,407
Be civilized. Stiff upper
lip and all of that, you know.

989
01:04:44,408 --> 01:04:47,614
You keep out of this,
you beetle-eyed bug.

990
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:49,526
You're just as bad as he is.

991
01:04:49,527 --> 01:04:51,758
Both of you are always trying to find
new ways to kill yourselves.

992
01:04:51,759 --> 01:04:54,555
Well, I hope you both make it.

993
01:05:00,472 --> 01:05:02,088
- Where did we go wrong?
- Where did we go wrong?

994
01:05:25,634 --> 01:05:28,257
Hey, so let's play
already, huh, daddy?

995
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:31,830
Eric Von Zipper plays
when Eric Von Zipper is ready.

996
01:05:41,466 --> 01:05:43,544
You stupid...

997
01:05:45,245 --> 01:05:47,165
Would you mind?
Would you mind?

998
01:05:57,166 --> 01:05:59,857
Boss. Hey, boss, read this.

999
01:06:00,930 --> 01:06:04,552
- You stupid?
- Oh, I’m sorry, boss. I forgot.

1000
01:06:04,553 --> 01:06:07,424
I’ll read it to you.
It’s by that fella, Honeycart.

1001
01:06:07,425 --> 01:06:10,681
Honeycart, he is my idol.
I adore him.

1002
01:06:10,682 --> 01:06:12,801
You wait till you hear this.

1003
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:16,489
It says, "This is a retro-action."

1004
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:20,672
- What does that mean, boss?
- Oh, that's when it's...

1005
01:06:20,673 --> 01:06:23,504
- Keep reading, stupid.
- Oh, yeah. Okay.

1006
01:06:23,505 --> 01:06:26,784
"This is a retro-action
of everything I have said,"

1007
01:06:26,785 --> 01:06:31,137
"and an ape-ology from the
farther-est reaches of my heart."

1008
01:06:31,138 --> 01:06:35,064
That's my friend.
He sure writes beautiful.

1009
01:06:35,065 --> 01:06:38,335
"I... I consider my actions
almost mani-acle"

1010
01:06:38,336 --> 01:06:41,750
"and want to tell the public
that all the young surfers"

1011
01:06:41,751 --> 01:06:44,774
"make our beaches ring
with joy and laughter."

1012
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:49,270
That's the worst stuff
that was ever read to me!

1013
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:50,606
What a fink!

1014
01:06:50,607 --> 01:06:52,726
And I thought he was a good guy!

1015
01:06:52,727 --> 01:06:55,974
Hey, daddy, are you gonna play
this pool game or ain't you?

1016
01:06:55,975 --> 01:06:59,222
Yeah, I’m gonna play pool.

1017
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:00,470
Dirty pool.

1018
01:07:00,471 --> 01:07:04,364
Out! Out!
Now my friend gets the Rats' revenge!

1019
01:07:06,424 --> 01:07:09,179
- Oh, I’m sorry, boss.
- You stupid.

1020
01:07:17,871 --> 01:07:20,942
How are you fixed for blood?

1021
01:07:20,943 --> 01:07:23,839
You want to play a game
before the moon comes out?

1022
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:28,798
All right. Just take it easy.
Cool it, daddy. I’ll play by myself.

1023
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:32,942
"And the presence of these young people
is a fond reminder to the older generation"

1024
01:07:32,943 --> 01:07:35,661
"that they were young once
and perhaps still are."

1025
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:39,639
Eric Von Zipper has been betrayed!

1026
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:41,727
The good guys of this world
has been betrayed!

1027
01:07:41,728 --> 01:07:44,230
And all because of one fink, you!

1028
01:07:44,231 --> 01:07:47,790
I must ask you and your
curious conglomeration to leave my office.

1029
01:07:47,791 --> 01:07:50,134
- What's he trying to say, boss?
- It don't make no difference.

1030
01:07:50,135 --> 01:07:53,215
We leave when Eric Von Zipper
says we leave.

1031
01:07:53,216 --> 01:07:57,383
You used to be my idol, but you turned
into a regular Arnold Benedict.

1032
01:07:57,384 --> 01:07:59,254
And all because of a woman.

1033
01:07:59,255 --> 01:08:02,350
A woman's work is never done,
but this one done it.

1034
01:08:02,351 --> 01:08:04,118
Then teachers is the worst kind.

1035
01:08:04,119 --> 01:08:07,495
You know what this is?
This is a regular Delilah and Simpson bit.

1036
01:08:07,496 --> 01:08:11,142
I must ask you to leave these premises
before you arouse my ire.

1037
01:08:11,143 --> 01:08:14,662
- What's that mean, boss?
- It means keep out of my office!

1038
01:08:15,255 --> 01:08:19,481
That does it! Now you will
get the Rats' revenge!

1039
01:08:19,687 --> 01:08:21,780
That'll be a pleasure.

1040
01:08:26,968 --> 01:08:28,583
You can let him go now

1041
01:08:28,584 --> 01:08:31,654
'cause Von Zipper does not like violence
in front of broads.

1042
01:08:31,655 --> 01:08:36,694
But Von Zipper will get his revenge
'cause Von Zipper always uses his head.

1043
01:08:37,967 --> 01:08:40,679
He done it again.
He gave himself the finger.

1044
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:42,737
Come on, let's get
him out of here.

1045
01:08:45,023 --> 01:08:47,650
Eric Von Zipper will get
his Rats' revenge!

1046
01:08:53,551 --> 01:08:55,655
Harvey, I never realized.

1047
01:08:55,656 --> 01:08:59,350
Well, deep down inside,
all we Honeywagons are full of...

1048
01:08:59,351 --> 01:09:02,022
Well, much more than one would suspect.

1049
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,190
Well, fellas, what do you think?

1050
01:09:10,191 --> 01:09:12,367
Are you kidding? It’s the greatest!

1051
01:09:13,288 --> 01:09:15,710
Come on. Look, I know it's not much,
but we can make it something.

1052
01:09:15,711 --> 01:09:17,006
Well, when do we start?

1053
01:09:17,007 --> 01:09:17,830
- Yeah.
- When?

1054
01:09:17,831 --> 01:09:19,598
Well, it isn't gonna be easy,
but we can do it.

1055
01:09:19,599 --> 01:09:22,022
We can make this rail
faster than anything on the strip.

1056
01:09:22,023 --> 01:09:24,062
But it's gonna cost us
every dime in our pockets.

1057
01:09:24,063 --> 01:09:26,230
So, what's money?

1058
01:09:26,231 --> 01:09:27,755
What we can't buy, we'll scrounge.

1059
01:09:27,756 --> 01:09:30,722
We'll turn this into something so fast
you can't even see the smoke.

1060
01:09:30,723 --> 01:09:32,906
The only one who'll see the smoke
is the Potato Bug.

1061
01:09:32,907 --> 01:09:37,603
- Smoked Potato Bug, you get it?
- Yeah. Well, let's start.

1062
01:09:37,604 --> 01:09:39,247
Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it!

1063
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:46,586
I guess you guys didn't get the message
when I told you about motorocity.

1064
01:09:46,587 --> 01:09:50,538
One of the most principled principles
of motorocity is generosity.

1065
01:09:50,539 --> 01:09:56,075
That's why I, Big Drag,
am going to loan this rail to him.

1066
01:09:56,076 --> 01:10:00,130
- Hey!
- Thanks a lot! Thanks, Big!

1067
01:10:00,131 --> 01:10:01,546
Gee, that's big of you, Big.

1068
01:10:01,547 --> 01:10:03,450
Another principle of motorocity is

1069
01:10:03,451 --> 01:10:06,477
that more people want to come
to a grudge race than any other kind.

1070
01:10:06,478 --> 01:10:08,132
But I wouldn't want to mention that

1071
01:10:08,133 --> 01:10:10,300
because some people might think
we're trying to commercialize

1072
01:10:10,301 --> 01:10:13,452
in a sport that deals
strictly for funds.

1073
01:10:13,453 --> 01:10:16,116
- I mean, fun.
- You're a good guy, Big.

1074
01:10:16,117 --> 01:10:18,052
Look at it, Dee Dee.

1075
01:10:18,053 --> 01:10:20,293
Right now it's just wheels and rails.

1076
01:10:20,294 --> 01:10:23,317
When that flag drops,
it becomes 1,000 horses.

1077
01:10:23,318 --> 01:10:24,908
And that's a lot of power.

1078
01:10:24,909 --> 01:10:27,956
It’s an 80-foot wave
and you ride close to the crest.

1079
01:10:27,957 --> 01:10:29,868
No. No, there's a difference.

1080
01:10:29,869 --> 01:10:33,252
The ocean, its wild and it's free.
It’s something you can't change.

1081
01:10:33,253 --> 01:10:36,149
But this, this is an engine,
a machine.

1082
01:10:36,150 --> 01:10:37,861
It can be controlled.

1083
01:10:37,862 --> 01:10:39,461
It scares me when I think about it.

1084
01:10:39,462 --> 01:10:41,756
It’s like you want to take
every chance there is.

1085
01:10:41,757 --> 01:10:45,219
Dee Dee, that's the way we've got to live.
That's what it's about.

1086
01:10:46,421 --> 01:10:50,883
You ride your 1,000 horses, Frankie.
I’ll be betting on every one of them.

1087
01:10:51,846 --> 01:10:53,701
Would you like
to give it a trial run, Frankie?

1088
01:10:53,702 --> 01:10:56,004
- You bet.
- Come on, fellas.

1089
01:10:56,005 --> 01:10:58,021
Come on, boys. Move it out.

1090
01:11:10,029 --> 01:11:13,388
<i>This time it's love</i>

1091
01:11:13,389 --> 01:11:16,108
<i>I can see it in his eyes</i>

1092
01:11:16,109 --> 01:11:19,692
<i>This time it's love</i>

1093
01:11:19,693 --> 01:11:22,829
<i>Though it should be no surprise</i>

1094
01:11:22,830 --> 01:11:25,365
<i>I’m like a little child</i>

1095
01:11:25,366 --> 01:11:28,884
<i>All starry-eyed and wild</i>

1096
01:11:28,885 --> 01:11:34,364
<i>This time it's love</i>

1097
01:11:34,365 --> 01:11:37,981
<i>This time it's real</i>

1098
01:11:37,982 --> 01:11:41,021
<i>I have found the boy for me</i>

1099
01:11:41,022 --> 01:11:44,074
<i>The way I feel</i>

1100
01:11:44,075 --> 01:11:47,251
<i>I know it was meant to be</i>

1101
01:11:47,252 --> 01:11:50,170
<i>I’ve always known somehow</i>

1102
01:11:50,171 --> 01:11:53,338
<i>The way it would be now</i>

1103
01:11:53,339 --> 01:11:59,219
<i>This time it's love</i>

1104
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:05,794
<i>How wonderful to know
that your dreams come true</i>

1105
01:12:05,795 --> 01:12:11,690
<i>How wonderful to know
someone cares for you</i>

1106
01:12:11,691 --> 01:12:15,018
<i>Oh, this time it's love</i>

1107
01:12:15,019 --> 01:12:18,163
<i>And I know each time we kiss</i>

1108
01:12:18,164 --> 01:12:21,131
<i>This time it's love</i>

1109
01:12:21,132 --> 01:12:24,362
<i>Suddenly I’m sure of this</i>

1110
01:12:24,363 --> 01:12:27,162
<i>I have that certain glow</i>

1111
01:12:27,163 --> 01:12:30,482
<i>That only lovers know</i>

1112
01:12:30,483 --> 01:12:48,571
<i>This time it's love</i>

1113
01:12:48,572 --> 01:12:51,563
<i>I have that certain glow</i>

1114
01:12:51,564 --> 01:12:54,794
<i>That only lovers know</i>

1115
01:12:54,795 --> 01:13:03,381
<i>This time it's love</i>

1116
01:13:17,195 --> 01:13:19,042
You stupids!

1117
01:13:30,043 --> 01:13:32,570
Now, here's how we
get the Rats' revenge.

1118
01:13:32,571 --> 01:13:34,754
Tomorrow is the grudge race, right?

1119
01:13:34,755 --> 01:13:35,419
Right!

1120
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:37,530
Whisper! Whisper! You stupids!

1121
01:13:40,531 --> 01:13:43,090
Now, we put the fix
on the Potato Bug's rail.

1122
01:13:43,091 --> 01:13:46,258
Now comes the race.
The Bug's rail goes powie.

1123
01:13:46,259 --> 01:13:48,906
And the Bug, he gets
hit with the flit. Right?

1124
01:13:48,907 --> 01:13:49,843
Right.

1125
01:13:49,844 --> 01:13:52,779
Now, everybody thinks that Frankie
done it account of it's a grudge race, see?

1126
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:55,186
So everybody will see
that the Von Zipper is right

1127
01:13:55,187 --> 01:13:57,778
and that the beach
bums is bums. Right?

1128
01:13:57,779 --> 01:13:59,690
Right.

1129
01:13:59,691 --> 01:14:00,690
Any questions?

1130
01:14:00,691 --> 01:14:01,818
- Yeah.
- What? What?

1131
01:14:01,819 --> 01:14:04,377
How do we put the fix
on the Potato Bug's rail?

1132
01:14:05,163 --> 01:14:07,971
Listen to the Von Zipper
and you will learn things.

1133
01:14:07,972 --> 01:14:10,962
First, we amputate the eliminator.

1134
01:14:10,963 --> 01:14:13,914
Then, we eliminate the amputator.

1135
01:14:13,915 --> 01:14:17,514
And from then on, it's simple.

1136
01:14:17,515 --> 01:14:19,046
Let's go.

1137
01:14:29,747 --> 01:14:31,530
Sorry, boss.

1138
01:14:31,531 --> 01:14:32,484
Thanks, boss.

1139
01:14:51,924 --> 01:14:53,827
Which one is it, boss?

1140
01:14:54,828 --> 01:14:56,586
That one.

1141
01:14:56,587 --> 01:14:59,282
Hey, it's kind of groovy, boss.

1142
01:14:59,283 --> 01:15:02,512
- Cycles is better.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, boss.

1143
01:15:02,771 --> 01:15:04,586
By the tire. By the tire!

1144
01:15:04,587 --> 01:15:07,239
Get a screwdriver.
I’ll loosen this nut.

1145
01:15:30,107 --> 01:15:33,082
Becca, what in the world
is a drag strip?

1146
01:15:33,083 --> 01:15:37,698
I haven't the faintest, but I’ll bet it's...
gonna be more fun than the mausoleum.

1147
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:39,251
Oh, I’ll bet.

1148
01:16:16,453 --> 01:16:20,301
Ladies and gentlemen, we're about to
blast off with the preliminary race.

1149
01:16:29,789 --> 01:16:33,013
You're right, Becca.
This is more fun than the mausoleum.

1150
01:16:33,014 --> 01:16:35,405
You just listen to me,
Florabella!

1151
01:16:35,406 --> 01:16:38,780
The winner is Fordney Allen
in his Mighty Malibu!

1152
01:16:38,781 --> 01:16:44,923
Time, 8.2 seconds at 198.3
miles per hour.

1153
01:17:04,886 --> 01:17:05,891
Clyde!

1154
01:17:05,892 --> 01:17:07,572
Clyde!

1155
01:17:07,573 --> 01:17:10,284
You've got them living
again and loving it.

1156
01:17:10,285 --> 01:17:12,300
Oh, I’m quite big with
the older types.

1157
01:17:12,301 --> 01:17:14,908
You're quite big with me, too.

1158
01:17:14,909 --> 01:17:17,572
Everybody go over to Big Drag's Pit Stop
and wait for me there.

1159
01:17:17,573 --> 01:17:19,949
Where we will have
the victory celebration to prove

1160
01:17:19,950 --> 01:17:22,117
that Eric Von Zipper done it again.

1161
01:17:22,118 --> 01:17:25,436
- Ain't you gonna go with us, boss?
- No, I’m gonna stay here for the kill.

1162
01:17:25,437 --> 01:17:26,772
Out! Out! Out!

1163
01:17:28,245 --> 01:17:30,124
Hey, wait!

1164
01:17:31,125 --> 01:17:33,164
Your attention, please.

1165
01:17:33,165 --> 01:17:35,773
The next event is the one
we've all been waiting for.

1166
01:17:35,774 --> 01:17:39,332
The match between England's champion,
the famous Potato Bug,

1167
01:17:39,333 --> 01:17:42,447
and Frankie, our own local surfer.

1168
01:17:44,701 --> 01:17:46,732
Potato!

1169
01:17:48,733 --> 01:17:50,797
Good luck, and I mean it.

1170
01:17:50,798 --> 01:17:54,369
Oh, yes, and may the better man
emerge victorious, old chap, don't you see.

1171
01:18:17,893 --> 01:18:20,812
Don't worry, Dee Dee.
It will all be over in a few seconds.

1172
01:18:20,813 --> 01:18:23,166
I wish you wouldn't put it that way.

1173
01:19:24,277 --> 01:19:25,692
You two all right?

1174
01:19:25,693 --> 01:19:28,535
That was my best rail.
I’ve been sabotaged.

1175
01:19:31,646 --> 01:19:34,740
I told them to fix the Potato
Bug's car. Those stupids.

1176
01:19:34,741 --> 01:19:36,204
Von Zipper.

1177
01:19:36,205 --> 01:19:38,444
It was, like, a mistake.
You know what I mean?

1178
01:19:38,445 --> 01:19:40,740
- Von Zipper did it.
- I did?

1179
01:19:40,741 --> 01:19:42,677
It wasn't me. There was a...
There was a group, see?

1180
01:19:42,678 --> 01:19:46,244
I told them to fix the Potato
Bug's car. Those stupids.

1181
01:19:46,245 --> 01:19:49,108
Don't go away. I’ll be right back,
see, 'cause I know the kids who did it.

1182
01:19:49,109 --> 01:19:51,364
So, you stay there,
and I’ll be right back.

1183
01:20:10,713 --> 01:20:13,120
How do you start it?
How do you start it?

1184
01:20:20,205 --> 01:20:22,132
How do you stop it?

1185
01:20:22,133 --> 01:20:24,029
Somebody, stop it!

1186
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:48,596
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
You're in the way!

1187
01:20:48,597 --> 01:20:50,612
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

1188
01:20:56,613 --> 01:20:58,636
Look out! Look out!

1189
01:21:02,637 --> 01:21:06,237
Look out! You're in the way!

1190
01:21:16,014 --> 01:21:18,689
Everybody back into the bus!
Follow those cars!

1191
01:21:40,901 --> 01:21:42,404
Look out!

1192
01:22:09,405 --> 01:22:12,389
Hey, look out! Move over!
Move! Move! You're in the way!

1193
01:22:19,390 --> 01:22:21,502
Look out!

1194
01:22:35,503 --> 01:22:37,191
Howdy.

1195
01:22:43,192 --> 01:22:45,622
Howdy?

1196
01:22:46,623 --> 01:22:49,765
- Deadhead, watch out!
- Watch out for what?

1197
01:23:10,503 --> 01:23:12,159
Can you believe this?

1198
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:19,263
- Shall we get some black coffee?
- No, I’m going back on the sauce.

1199
01:23:48,447 --> 01:23:50,167
Oh, that's stupid!

1200
01:23:58,168 --> 01:24:01,094
Well, you made it, boss.
Sort of.

1201
01:24:11,095 --> 01:24:13,304
I knew I shouldn't have had
that door fixed.

1202
01:24:13,704 --> 01:24:17,673
You! You sabotager, you!
You rail derailer!

1203
01:24:22,655 --> 01:24:24,913
They told me there'd
be days like this.

1204
01:24:34,567 --> 01:24:36,262
Now, stop that!

1205
01:24:41,263 --> 01:24:42,582
Don't, Harvey!

1206
01:24:42,583 --> 01:24:43,638
There he is!

1207
01:24:43,639 --> 01:24:45,527
There's the fink
that ain't our idol no more!

1208
01:24:45,528 --> 01:24:48,007
Our side needs all the
help we can get, my dear.

1209
01:24:48,008 --> 01:24:50,055
Clyde! Clyde!

1210
01:24:55,135 --> 01:24:57,983
Pyramids, play something!
Play something!

1211
01:25:01,856 --> 01:25:03,619
- What?
- You've done it again, boss.

1212
01:25:24,183 --> 01:25:25,734
Candy!

1213
01:25:25,735 --> 01:25:26,905
Come on. Give them your bit.
There!

1214
01:25:33,997 --> 01:25:36,098
My place, they're ruining it.

1215
01:25:38,525 --> 01:25:41,210
Oh, they really are ruining me!

1216
01:25:44,981 --> 01:25:47,741
Oh, jolly good! Yes!

1217
01:25:47,742 --> 01:25:48,860
Oh, hi there, ducks.

1218
01:25:48,861 --> 01:25:52,078
Sorry I’m late, but I had to stop
for some petrol, don't you know.

1219
01:25:54,605 --> 01:25:55,652
Oh, my word, ducks.

1220
01:25:55,653 --> 01:25:58,810
ln England, one would call this
a spot of the old nasty, yes.

1221
01:25:58,822 --> 01:26:01,075
But in France,
we would call it an election.

1222
01:26:08,701 --> 01:26:10,785
Oh, bit of a near thing, that.

1223
01:26:15,254 --> 01:26:17,234
Oh, good show! Liked that!

1224
01:26:24,189 --> 01:26:27,084
- Oh, I say, ducks. Isn’t he one of ours?
- Oui.

1225
01:26:27,085 --> 01:26:29,997
Yes. Excuse me, old boy.

1226
01:26:29,998 --> 01:26:31,694
Not very sporting, lad.

1227
01:26:32,398 --> 01:26:34,677
I don't want you to see
what's gonna happen to you.

1228
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:38,628
Thank you. It’s called
karate, old boy.

1229
01:26:38,629 --> 01:26:40,453
Oh, he's all yours, ducks.

1230
01:26:43,733 --> 01:26:45,484
Hey, your shoelace is untied.

1231
01:26:49,206 --> 01:26:50,995
Now, stop it!

1232
01:27:02,349 --> 01:27:05,049
Thank you, my dear.
Now, please repair to a safer place.

1233
01:27:12,464 --> 01:27:14,118
Are you all right?

1234
01:27:32,119 --> 01:27:34,142
Which do you prefer, love?

1235
01:27:34,143 --> 01:27:36,334
- Him.
- Good-o.

1236
01:27:39,335 --> 01:27:42,663
Good show! Good show!
Enjoy! Enjoy!

1237
01:27:42,664 --> 01:27:45,559
- Excuse me, old boy.
- What? What? What?

1238
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:49,330
Why you rotten little bug!
I’m gonna squash you!

1239
01:27:57,548 --> 01:27:59,101
What's all that?

1240
01:28:02,855 --> 01:28:04,866
Most peculiar, that. Yes.

1241
01:28:06,607 --> 01:28:08,104
Hold her still!
Hold her still!

1242
01:28:13,172 --> 01:28:14,640
You stupid...

1243
01:28:16,192 --> 01:28:19,110
- Parcheez!
- What is that, "parcheez"?

1244
01:28:19,111 --> 01:28:21,737
That's what it is, "parcheez."

1245
01:28:29,223 --> 01:28:30,434
I want to say...

1246
01:28:32,671 --> 01:28:35,831
Now cut that out, Clyde,
or I’ll rent you a room at the zoo.

1247
01:28:40,351 --> 01:28:42,983
If I didn't own this
joint, I’d sue me.

1248
01:28:51,224 --> 01:28:53,351
You stupid...

1249
01:28:54,151 --> 01:28:56,359
No! I’m too young to die!

1250
01:28:58,751 --> 01:29:01,662
Now, put that back.
That's part of my wall.

1251
01:29:01,663 --> 01:29:03,995
- That's part of his wall.
- That's part of his wall.

1252
01:29:06,431 --> 01:29:09,083
First my wall, now my art.

1253
01:29:15,279 --> 01:29:18,366
How many times do I have to tell you?
My work is not for sale.

1254
01:29:18,367 --> 01:29:20,911
One of them is a masterpiece.
I’ll take it.

1255
01:29:20,912 --> 01:29:22,895
It is? You will?

1256
01:29:22,896 --> 01:29:24,651
That's the one!

1257
01:29:28,263 --> 01:29:29,542
But, but, but, but.

1258
01:29:29,543 --> 01:29:33,539
Have it sent to my place and there'll
be a check for $1,000 waiting.

1259
01:29:37,512 --> 01:29:40,201
I must tell Vincent Price
about this place.

1260
01:29:43,863 --> 01:29:45,668
Oh, what monsters.

1261
01:29:48,231 --> 01:29:50,511
- Come on, Miss Florabella!
- All right.

1262
01:29:50,512 --> 01:29:52,344
- Oh, come on! We've got to go.
- All right

1263
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:53,148
Well, come on!

1264
01:29:57,151 --> 01:29:58,061
Hi, Clyde.

1265
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:12,298
Hey, you guys, the battle's over!
Von Zipper's stoned again!

1266
01:30:13,039 --> 01:30:15,494
All right, you Rats, get him out of here!
Get that creep out of here!

1267
01:30:15,495 --> 01:30:17,046
Come on, boss. Wake up! Wake up!

1268
01:30:17,047 --> 01:30:19,422
- He's back in those Himalayan suspenders.
- Yup, he's done it again.

1269
01:30:19,423 --> 01:30:21,310
Let's get him out of here.

1270
01:30:23,056 --> 01:30:26,595
The great Von Zipper will return!

1271
01:30:28,567 --> 01:30:29,846
Well! Can you believe that?

1272
01:30:29,847 --> 01:30:34,838
I tell you, Becca, this is the most fun
I’ve had since Berry's Nut Farm.

1273
01:30:34,839 --> 01:30:36,510
Well, how'd you make out, Potato?

1274
01:30:36,511 --> 01:30:38,311
Oh, it was a wonderful sport.
Splendid really.

1275
01:30:38,312 --> 01:30:40,823
I must tell them about this upon my
return in London town, eh, ducks?

1276
01:30:40,824 --> 01:30:43,126
We're gonna miss you, Bug.
What are your plans?

1277
01:30:43,127 --> 01:30:44,662
Oh, jolly good, I should say.

1278
01:30:44,663 --> 01:30:46,166
Lady Bug and I
have come to an agreement.

1279
01:30:46,167 --> 01:30:48,062
Wedding bells and all that
sort of rot, don't you know.

1280
01:30:48,063 --> 01:30:49,606
Hey, congratulations!

1281
01:30:49,607 --> 01:30:51,254
I hope you two don't fight
as much as Dee Dee and I.

1282
01:30:51,255 --> 01:30:53,286
Oh, I should hope not.
I abhor fisticuffs.

1283
01:30:53,287 --> 01:30:56,399
Or, in your case,
my dear, "footsicuffs."

1284
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:57,775
I made a deal with him.

1285
01:30:57,776 --> 01:31:01,945
He does not raise his voice to me,
I do not raise my feet to him.

1286
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:11,366
Welcome to Big Drag's Pit Stop.

1287
01:31:11,367 --> 01:31:14,110
Come on in, folks.
Come on in and join the kids.

1288
01:31:14,111 --> 01:31:17,294
Ladies and gentlemen,
Clydes and birds, and all you kids,

1289
01:31:17,295 --> 01:31:21,666
it gives me great pleasure
to present to you Little Stevie Wonder.

1290
01:31:27,455 --> 01:31:30,726
<i>- Dance and shout, work it on out
- Come on</i>

1291
01:31:30,727 --> 01:31:32,422
<i>- Dance and shout, work it on out
- Everybody, oh, yeah</i>

1292
01:31:32,423 --> 01:31:34,822
<i>Come on, everybody
and follow me</i>

1293
01:31:34,823 --> 01:31:37,695
That certainly isn't
the bunny hop they're doing.

1294
01:31:37,696 --> 01:31:43,318
<i>Come on, clap your hands
and shout with glee, yeah</i>

1295
01:31:43,319 --> 01:31:46,382
<i>Just take off both
of your shoes</i>

1296
01:31:46,383 --> 01:31:49,254
<i>Now that's the way to
lose your blues</i>

1297
01:31:49,255 --> 01:31:54,871
<i>You get a happy feeling
when you dance and shout, oh, yeah</i>

1298
01:31:54,872 --> 01:32:00,182
<i>- Come on everybody dance
- Dance and shout, work it on out</i>

1299
01:32:00,183 --> 01:32:03,414
<i>I want to know what
you got to lose</i>

1300
01:32:03,415 --> 01:32:06,158
<i>- Come on and take a chance
- Dance and shout, work it on out</i>

1301
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:08,703
<i>'Cause everybody's doing fine</i>

1302
01:32:08,704 --> 01:32:13,038
<i>Come on, everybody
Come on and form a line</i>

1303
01:32:13,039 --> 01:32:19,311
<i>You get a happy feeling when you
dance and shout, work it on out</i>

1304
01:32:19,312 --> 01:32:22,043
<i>Dance and shout, work it on out</i>

1305
01:32:26,727 --> 01:32:30,678
- Isn’t this the living end?
- Not for me, Florabella.

1306
01:32:30,679 --> 01:32:34,393
It’s only the beginning.
It isn't the end at all.

1307
01:32:37,672 --> 01:32:40,446
<i>- Dance and shout, work it on out
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, now that's the way</i>

1308
01:32:40,447 --> 01:32:45,958
<i>- Dance and shout, work it on out
- Oh, yes</i>

1309
01:32:45,959 --> 01:32:49,014
<i>You know we've got a dance
that's here to stay</i>

1310
01:32:49,015 --> 01:32:51,687
<i>Dance and shout, work it on out</i>

1311
01:32:51,688 --> 01:32:54,663
<i>Because everybody's doing fine</i>

1312
01:32:54,664 --> 01:32:57,526
<i>Come on, let's rock it
one more time</i>

1313
01:32:57,527 --> 01:33:00,446
<i>Because you get a happy feeling
when you dance and shout, oh, yeah</i>

1314
01:33:00,447 --> 01:33:06,366
<i>- Dance and shout, work it on out
- What did you say? Oh, now I got it</i>

1315
01:33:08,541 --> 01:33:14,165
<i>- Dance and shout, work it on out
- Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah, yeah</i>

1316
01:33:26,375 --> 01:33:29,158
<i>I got you where I want you
I want you where I got you</i>

1317
01:33:29,159 --> 01:33:32,094
<i>You're never gonna
get away from me</i>

1318
01:33:32,095 --> 01:33:35,030
<i>I want you where I got you
I got you where I want you</i>

1319
01:33:35,031 --> 01:33:37,718
<i>There's no one else around
but you and me, yeah</i>

1320
01:33:37,719 --> 01:33:40,775
<i>We got plenty of time
They won't be home until nine</i>

1321
01:33:40,776 --> 01:33:43,910
<i>I got you all to myself
until then</i>

1322
01:33:43,911 --> 01:33:46,838
<i>My mom and my dad say
