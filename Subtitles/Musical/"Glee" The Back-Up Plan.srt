There must be a mistake.

This is Fanny Brice.
I'm supposed

16
00:00:41,512 --> 00:00:43,079
to be meeting Rachel Berry.

17
00:00:43,114 --> 00:00:44,714
Hi, Mr. Rivkin.

18
00:00:44,748 --> 00:00:46,950
Rachel...

19
00:00:46,984 --> 00:00:50,253
we at Innovative Creative
Artists are so excited

20
00:00:50,287 --> 00:00:52,055
(gasps) to go to work for you.

21
00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:54,257
We want to be
in the Rachel Berry business.

22
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,025
And I'm not just talking
about me.

23
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,560
I'm talking
about your whole team.

24
00:00:57,595 --> 00:01:01,631
You got Mark and Matt
and Sheila and Joe.

25
00:01:01,665 --> 00:01:03,733
Although they're not
to be trusted, okay?

26
00:01:03,768 --> 00:01:05,568
I just...
I'm your point person.

27
00:01:05,603 --> 00:01:07,537
- I just want you to deal with me, okay?
- Oh. Okay.

28
00:01:07,571 --> 00:01:08,905
Okay, okay,
great. So,

29
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,907
let's talk about your future!

30
00:01:10,941 --> 00:01:13,576
- Yeah.
- What does Rachel Berry want? Because...

31
00:01:13,611 --> 00:01:14,644
she can have it.

32
00:01:14,678 --> 00:01:16,413
Well, um, I guess
I want to have

33
00:01:16,447 --> 00:01:18,014
a good run with the show,

34
00:01:18,048 --> 00:01:21,684
I-I don't know, maybe parlay
this into a movie career,

35
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:23,086
or get onto a big hit

36
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,422
- TV show, so...
- Uh-huh, great, great, great. Rachel,

37
00:01:25,456 --> 00:01:27,357
those are not for you.

38
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:28,892
What?

39
00:01:28,926 --> 00:01:31,861
Have you ever heard the term,
"a face for radio"?

40
00:01:31,896 --> 00:01:33,163
Rachel, you're a rare breed.

41
00:01:33,197 --> 00:01:35,398
I mean, you got talent
coming out of your ears.

42
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:38,268
But you got to remember
something... this is TV, okay?

43
00:01:38,302 --> 00:01:39,969
TV, the cameras,

44
00:01:40,004 --> 00:01:41,738
they're this close, okay?
They see everything.

45
00:01:41,772 --> 00:01:43,573
- Yeah.
- And movies, the same thing.

46
00:01:43,574 --> 00:01:44,741
It's this close,

47
00:01:44,775 --> 00:01:46,276
except this time...

48
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,344
your face is
on a gigantic screen,

49
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:51,081
so that, for example... and this
is just a for-instance...

50
00:01:51,115 --> 00:01:53,983
your nose is gonna be
40 feet tall.

51
00:01:54,018 --> 00:01:57,220
You got to ask yourself...
is this gonna work?

52
00:01:57,254 --> 00:01:59,322
And I think the answer is...

53
00:01:59,356 --> 00:02:02,125
no... it won't.

54
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,793
Here's what I see for you.

55
00:02:03,828 --> 00:02:05,462
If we play our cards right,

56
00:02:05,496 --> 00:02:06,763
you could make a killing.

57
00:02:06,797 --> 00:02:08,231
You could be doing Fanny Brice

58
00:02:08,265 --> 00:02:10,967
for five, ten,
I don't know, 15 years.

59
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:13,103
Look at Topol. I mean,
he's been doing Tevye

60
00:02:13,137 --> 00:02:14,971
for what, I don't know,
what, forever?

61
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:16,873
Okay? And we're all
in agreement on this...

62
00:02:16,907 --> 00:02:19,376
Matt and Mike and
Sheila and Joe. Rachel,

63
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,078

64
00:02:22,113 --> 00:02:24,180
But I don't want you
talking to them, okay?

65
00:02:24,215 --> 00:02:26,483

to deal with me, all right?

She's not an actress.

She's just, like, the coolest
socialite in the world.

81

She's the widow of Lester
Dolloway, the mineral baron.

Her picture's been taken
by Helmut Newton.

And she took peyote
with Joe Kennedy... allegedly.

84
00:03:05,656 --> 00:03:06,990
- Impressive.
- Yeah,

85
00:03:07,024 --> 00:03:08,425
and she's pretty much the patron

86
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,326
behind every artistic endeavor
in Manhattan.

as one of the performers. I already was!

My God, Kurt, that's amazing.
I'm so happy for you.

89
00:03:15,427 --> 00:03:18,214
Yeah, I really want to do "Story
of My Life" from One Direction.

90
00:03:18,235 --> 00:03:20,904
That's a good song, but that's
sung by five different people.

91
00:03:20,938 --> 00:03:23,840
How are you gonna sing all those
layers as just one person?

92
00:03:23,874 --> 00:03:24,941
Well, you'll be singing with me.

Thank you.

Let's go rehearse.

99
00:03:36,344 --> 00:03:38,864
SANTANA: What are you
doing home so early?

100
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:41,090
I thought that you'd be in
the recording studio all day.

101
00:03:41,092 --> 00:03:43,560
Yeah, well, my producer
just listened to the final cut

102
00:03:43,594 --> 00:03:46,896
of my album, and in his words:
"Didn't hear a single."

103
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:49,399
Now he's worried

104
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:51,334
that the label won't give it
a release date.

105
00:03:51,369 --> 00:03:53,203
Wait. What?

106
00:03:53,237 --> 00:03:56,006
And you're just gonna
listen to these morons?

107
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,440
You know, if I don't get backed
by the label, that means that

108
00:03:58,442 --> 00:04:01,144
I won't get any promotion, which
means I don't get any airplay,

109
00:04:01,178 --> 00:04:03,046
which means I'm just
another no-hit wonder.

110
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,048
(sighs): Well, you would,
uh, still be doing

111
00:04:05,082 --> 00:04:07,017
a hell of a lot better than me.

112
00:04:07,051 --> 00:04:09,285
I would kill to
be you right now,

113
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,787
thinking about creating

114
00:04:10,821 --> 00:04:14,224
the perfect single to
save my record deal.

115
00:04:14,258 --> 00:04:16,059
You know, maybe you can.

116
00:04:16,093 --> 00:04:17,961
What are you talking about?

117
00:04:17,995 --> 00:04:19,696
No, no, Santana, I'm serious.

118
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:22,565
Remember back in high school,
every time we sang together,

119
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,967
it was always magic.

120
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:25,402
So...

121
00:04:25,436 --> 00:04:28,071

some of that again.

175
00:07:23,447 --> 00:07:24,981
Oh. Uh, Lee Paulblatt.

176
00:07:25,015 --> 00:07:26,336
- Hello. (chuckles)
- Yes, I have been

177
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,918
in love with<i> Funny Girl</i>
since I was, like, seven.

178
00:07:28,952 --> 00:07:30,686
A-Are you a friend of Paolo's?

179
00:07:30,721 --> 00:07:32,188
No, no, no, no.
Well, I mean, yes.

180
00:07:32,222 --> 00:07:34,056
We did a pilot with him
a few years back.

181
00:07:34,091 --> 00:07:35,791
It was a train wreck.
It's not Paolo's fault,

182
00:07:35,826 --> 00:07:36,959
but... Actually, it is.

183
00:07:36,994 --> 00:07:40,196
But no, I actually
came here to see you.

184
00:07:42,132 --> 00:07:44,734
I'm, uh, Lee Paulblatt.

185
00:07:44,768 --> 00:07:47,336
I'm from Fox, the
television company.

186
00:07:47,371 --> 00:07:48,704
- Oh.
- Yeah.

187
00:07:48,739 --> 00:07:50,973
- Oh, okay.
- (laughs): Oh, okay. Yeah.

188
00:07:51,008 --> 00:07:53,409
Yeah, I'm just in New York for the
up-fronts, and this is<i> the</i> show

189
00:07:53,443 --> 00:07:55,077
- that I wanted to see.
- Oh...

190
00:07:55,112 --> 00:07:57,213
Actually, I wanted to see the Rachel
Weisz-Daniel Craig<i> Betrayal...</i>

191
00:07:57,247 --> 00:08:00,149
but that's an impossible ticket to get...
and there was this woman in this show

192
00:08:00,183 --> 00:08:03,152
that was just eating candy the entire time...
I wanted to punch her in the face...

193
00:08:03,186 --> 00:08:05,288
<i>but</i> I enjoyed it, and
you were wonderful.

194
00:08:05,322 --> 00:08:06,722
Rachel...

195
00:08:06,757 --> 00:08:09,258
I have got a pilot that I think
you would be fantastic for.

196
00:08:09,293 --> 00:08:10,726
It's called<i> Song of Solomon.</i>

197
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:12,228
I would love

198
00:08:12,262 --> 00:08:14,363
for you to come in
to test for it.

199
00:08:14,398 --> 00:08:15,798
I think you would be
perfect for it.

200
00:08:15,832 --> 00:08:17,033
I mean, I close
my eyes, Rachel,

201
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:18,968
and all I see is you in it.

202
00:08:19,002 --> 00:08:21,938
That's how powerful of an image
that you created for me tonight

203
00:08:21,972 --> 00:08:23,205
upon that stage.

204
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,320
God, I wish I had
a singing voice. I don't.

205
00:08:25,342 --> 00:08:27,276
I'm not allowed to sing...
my mother said that...

206
00:08:27,311 --> 00:08:29,679
because I have this...
I digress.

207
00:08:29,713 --> 00:08:32,348
Does this sound like something
that you would be interested in?

208
00:08:32,382 --> 00:08:34,617
- Yes. Of course!
- Well, great.

209
00:08:34,651 --> 00:08:36,892
Well, we're gonna want you
to read with our Solomon,

210
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,422
but, uh, he is in the middle
of shooting a feature.

211
00:08:39,456 --> 00:08:40,590
It's a terrible feature.

212
00:08:40,624 --> 00:08:42,458
I don't know why
he's chosen to do it.

213
00:08:42,492 --> 00:08:44,126
<i>But</i> I am not his agent.

214
00:08:44,161 --> 00:08:47,163
So, we would need to do it
next Tuesday in L.A.

215
00:08:47,197 --> 00:08:48,864
Does that work for you?

216
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:50,299
Um... no...

217
00:08:50,334 --> 00:08:52,201
Well, Tuesday
I have a show, so...

218
00:08:52,236 --> 00:08:54,870
Uh, actually, your understudy
has a show on Tuesday.

219
00:08:54,905 --> 00:08:58,407
Ah, just fly out for Tuesday,
and do the test, and then you

220
00:08:58,442 --> 00:09:00,443
can hop on the next flight back.
Does that work for you?

221
00:09:00,477 --> 00:09:02,345
You know what? I'm gonna leave
before you can say no.

222
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:03,679
That's how I work. Bye.

223
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:10,122
Hey. This is for you.

224
00:09:10,156 --> 00:09:11,857
Oh, my God, it looks so good.

225
00:09:11,891 --> 00:09:12,824
So, we're a hit?

226
00:09:12,859 --> 00:09:14,092
Oh, come on.

227
00:09:14,127 --> 00:09:17,696
You are so amazing up there!
Amazing! (laughs)

228
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,264
We're gonna run forever.

229
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:21,466
Thank you, Sidney, and I really...
I want to make you proud,

230
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:24,136
it's just, um... I just, I
think I'm feeling, you know,

231
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,138
the wear and tear of
the eight shows a week,

232
00:09:26,172 --> 00:09:28,140
and, I mean, I wouldn't
want to get sick

233
00:09:28,174 --> 00:09:30,042
- and miss a performance...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no,

234
00:09:30,076 --> 00:09:32,477
no, no, no.
You're not gonna...

235
00:09:32,512 --> 00:09:34,513
(sputters) Put that...
put that out of your head.

236
00:09:34,547 --> 00:09:36,615
You're not gonna get sick.
Tell you what.

237
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:38,417
I'm gonna call
Dr. Sugarman,

238
00:09:38,451 --> 00:09:40,953
the best ENT in New York.

239
00:09:40,987 --> 00:09:45,057
He's gonna give you,
um, a B12 drip, and also,

240
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:46,892
um, shoot steroids
down your throat.

241
00:09:46,926 --> 00:09:49,161
(groans) Um, I mean,
wouldn't it be easier

242
00:09:49,195 --> 00:09:51,864
for me to just, you
know, take a show off?

243
00:09:51,898 --> 00:09:55,167
No, no, no, no. I mean, your
understudy is beautiful, she is.

244
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:57,536
You know, maybe
if you, you know,

245
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,772
if your head came off, or there was a...
some kind of invasion

246
00:10:00,807 --> 00:10:04,476
of aliens in midtown
Manhattan,<i> maybe, maybe.</i>

were talking about.

you got yourself an album.

RACHEL:
Kurt, this TV show

336
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,151
is a huge opportunity.

337
00:13:32,185 --> 00:13:33,852
All you've been
talking about for years

338
00:13:33,887 --> 00:13:35,854
is getting on Broadway.
Well, now you have.

339
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:37,589
You've made it. You're
that one-in-a-million girl

340
00:13:37,624 --> 00:13:38,824
who actually did it.

341
00:13:38,858 --> 00:13:40,692
Look, every single person
that works on Broadway

342
00:13:40,727 --> 00:13:43,662
wants to make it in TV or film.
And if you think about it,

343
00:13:43,696 --> 00:13:46,031
some of Hollywood's greats
were plucked from the stage.

344
00:13:46,065 --> 00:13:47,933
Hugh Jackman, Diane Keaton,

345
00:13:47,967 --> 00:13:49,735
Meryl Streep. Meryl.

346
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:51,236
And how many of them
quit their shows

347
00:13:51,271 --> 00:13:52,504
less than a month
after opening night?

348
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:53,939
I'm not quitting. No w...

349
00:13:53,973 --> 00:13:55,908
(scoffs)
I am not quitting, okay?

350
00:13:55,942 --> 00:13:58,444
It is, like, just an audition.
I'm actually doing something

351
00:13:58,478 --> 00:13:59,878
really nice for my understudy.
I'm just gonna,

352
00:13:59,913 --> 00:14:01,213
like, take a sick day.

353
00:14:01,247 --> 00:14:03,248
- You mean lie?
- Look,

354
00:14:03,283 --> 00:14:05,517
if someone came to you
at NYADA right now

355
00:14:05,552 --> 00:14:07,386
and asked you to audition
for this TV show,

356
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,754
tell me you would say no.

357
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,891
Fine. Go for it.

358
00:14:12,926 --> 00:14:16,228
But just don't lie
to Sidney Greene.

359
00:14:16,262 --> 00:14:18,363
You'd just be asking
for more trouble.

360
00:14:18,398 --> 00:14:20,099
Yes, hello,
this is Rachel Berry.

361
00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:22,267
Uh, Berry. With a B.

362
00:14:22,302 --> 00:14:25,137
Yes, hi, uh,
I would just like to, uh,

363
00:14:25,171 --> 00:14:26,605
confirm my audition, please.

364
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,041
Good evening. Tonight,

365
00:14:29,075 --> 00:14:31,810
please welcome
to our newly christened

366
00:14:31,845 --> 00:14:35,447
Dolloway Dance Lab,
our guest of honor,

367
00:14:35,482 --> 00:14:38,384
Mrs. June Dolloway.

368
00:14:38,418 --> 00:14:40,452

369
00:14:40,487 --> 00:14:42,821
(applause)

370
00:14:42,856 --> 00:14:44,790
Oh, she's stunning.

371
00:14:44,824 --> 00:14:47,259
Modern American royalty,
look at her.

372
00:14:57,303 --> 00:14:59,104
Two of our finest

373
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:02,107
have been selected
to perform for you.

374
00:15:02,142 --> 00:15:05,444
Kurt Hummel and Blaine Anderson.

Oh, I want to thank you.
Thank you.

421
00:17:49,676 --> 00:17:51,844
Thank you.
I love your youthful energy.

422
00:17:51,878 --> 00:17:53,278
- (whispers): Oh, thank you.
- You know,

423
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,614
I have a very discerning
and tasteful eye

424
00:17:55,649 --> 00:17:57,016
for the extraordinary.

425
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:00,486
And I love to hone it
like a rough diamond

426
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,987
until it sparkles.

427
00:18:02,022 --> 00:18:04,023
I have a good feeling
about you.

428
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,595
Would you be so kind
as to escort me to the

429
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:12,798
SoHo Center for
Outsider Art next week?

430
00:18:12,832 --> 00:18:14,400
And then we can

431
00:18:14,434 --> 00:18:16,302
discuss your future

432
00:18:16,336 --> 00:18:19,838
over a $25,000 plate
of rubber chicken.

433
00:18:19,873 --> 00:18:21,206
(stammers) Oh, my good...

434
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:24,443
A-Absolutely. I would love to.
I-I am your lump of coal.

435
00:18:24,477 --> 00:18:26,478
Mm. Not you, dear.

436
00:18:27,581 --> 00:18:29,148
You.

437
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:32,184
Sorry.

438
00:18:35,587 --> 00:18:37,270
I tried to sneak you an extra ticket,

439
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,668
I just didn't have
the 25 grand it would cost.

440
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:43,003
I don't know, maybe I should
just stay home with you

441
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,204
and watch<i> Scandal.</i>

442
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:45,606
Would you stop it?

443
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,142
I'm a little jealous,
but I'm not resentful.

444
00:18:48,176 --> 00:18:49,710
All right? I-I'm
genuinely happy for you.

445
00:18:49,744 --> 00:18:52,146
I just feel like
being one of June's projects

446
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,881
is gonna take up a lot of time.

447
00:18:53,915 --> 00:18:55,482
I especially don't want
a friend that's gonna

448
00:18:55,517 --> 00:18:56,550
keep me away from you.

449
00:18:56,585 --> 00:18:58,419
Well, June isn't
exactly a friend.

450
00:18:58,453 --> 00:18:59,954
Yeah, you're probably right.

451
00:18:59,988 --> 00:19:00,955
How do I look?

452
00:19:00,989 --> 00:19:02,590
Like Montgomery Clift.

453
00:19:02,624 --> 00:19:03,924
What?

454
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:04,959
Before the accident.

455
00:19:04,993 --> 00:19:06,527
Oh, thank you.

456
00:19:06,561 --> 00:19:08,961
Try to have fun tonight, all
right? And don't worry about me.

457
00:19:08,964 --> 00:19:10,531
Remember, whatever door
June opens for you,

458
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:12,733
I'll be right there next to you
walking through it with you.

459
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,834
You're taking one for the team.

460
00:19:13,868 --> 00:19:15,869
I love you.

461
00:19:21,977 --> 00:19:24,345
BLAINE:
Who are all of these people?

462
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:27,248
DOLLOWAY: This is the one
percent of one percent.

463
00:19:27,282 --> 00:19:30,417
Never have so many boring
and rich people

464
00:19:30,452 --> 00:19:38,452
found themselves grouped
together in such a space.

465
00:19:39,302 --> 00:19:42,070
He thinks someone like you is
too fabulous to have friends.

466
00:19:42,105 --> 00:19:45,807
No, I... My friends are why
I'm fabulous. Andrew.

467
00:19:45,842 --> 00:19:47,275
This is Blaine.

468
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,077
Hi. Pleasure.

469
00:19:49,112 --> 00:19:50,412
No, friends are everything.

470
00:19:50,446 --> 00:19:53,048
You are the company you keep.

471
00:19:53,082 --> 00:19:55,851
That is why, Blaine,
if I'm gonna launch your career

472
00:19:55,885 --> 00:19:58,787
and make the world know who you
are, we have to be friends.

473
00:19:58,821 --> 00:20:02,157
I have to know you, spend time
with you, know what you like.

474
00:20:02,191 --> 00:20:04,793
It's the only way I can
really serve you, you see.

475
00:20:04,827 --> 00:20:06,661
What-What is the take?

476
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,540
Holding steady at two million.

477
00:20:09,565 --> 00:20:10,665
Two million?

478
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,300
(mouths silently)
Has anybody told them

479
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:13,869
the recession is over?

480
00:20:13,903 --> 00:20:15,670
I can't force them
to give, June.

481
00:20:15,705 --> 00:20:17,439
(laughing):
No.

482
00:20:17,473 --> 00:20:19,574
Okay. We have to inspire them.

483
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:21,410
Um, where... where
are you going?

484
00:20:21,444 --> 00:20:23,345
I'm gonna go earn our supper.

485
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:30,485
Okay, everybody.
Now, settle down.

486
00:20:31,854 --> 00:20:34,523
Now, you know that
I've been to all of your events

487
00:20:34,557 --> 00:20:37,893
and I've written some pretty
fat checks myself, correct?

488
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:40,829
So tonight is your opportunity
to return the favor.

489
00:20:40,863 --> 00:20:42,697
And when I say fat,

490
00:20:42,732 --> 00:20:45,000
I mean "Fatty Arbuckle fat."

491
00:20:45,034 --> 00:20:46,668
(soft laughter)
I-I don't mean

492
00:20:46,702 --> 00:20:48,970
fat as in your
chubby first wife.

493
00:20:49,005 --> 00:20:52,674
Now, you're gonna get
something for the money.

494
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,543
Believe me.
I have something special.

495
00:20:54,577 --> 00:20:56,078
Blaine, come up, please.

496
00:20:56,112 --> 00:20:58,814
I want to introduce you. Blaine Anderson.
(applause)

497
00:21:06,889 --> 00:21:10,125
Blaine... Blaine here
is my new discovery.

498
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,862
And, as you all know,
I'm never wrong. So...

00:23:33,102 --> 00:23:36,071
Look, they just want a
great song from me, okay?

542
00:23:36,105 --> 00:23:38,206
They don't care how
I give it to 'em. Just trust me.

543
00:23:38,241 --> 00:23:39,408
D'SHON: Hey.

544
00:23:39,442 --> 00:23:41,276
Did I get the days mixed up?

545
00:23:41,311 --> 00:23:43,545
- I was expecting you tomorrow.
- Well,

546
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:46,214
Santana and I were talking,
and we were thinking...

547
00:23:46,249 --> 00:23:48,417
that that song we're
looking for is a duet.

548
00:23:48,451 --> 00:23:50,419
And don't just say no,

549
00:23:50,453 --> 00:23:51,586
because we sounded great.

550
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:53,255
On a Lauryn Hill song, yeah.

551
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:55,023
But I liked the song we had.

552
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,759
We just needed a new take
on it, which is what we got.

553
00:23:57,794 --> 00:24:01,630
You, pure, raw, underground.

554
00:24:01,664 --> 00:24:03,765
Yeah, but the take that<i> I</i> want

555
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,868
is a duet with me and my girl.

556
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,770
Uh...

557
00:24:08,805 --> 00:24:11,139
look, Mercedes,
I know this is your friend...

558
00:24:11,174 --> 00:24:13,041
and you got something...

559
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:15,877
but this is your calling card.

560
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,713
This is going to be your story.

561
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,548
Introducing another voice,

562
00:24:19,582 --> 00:24:20,782
how do we sell that?

563
00:24:20,817 --> 00:24:22,517
Think Macklemore and Ryan Lewis.

564
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,455
Mercedes, I think
that we should go.

565
00:24:26,489 --> 00:24:28,357
I'm just trying to protect you.

566
00:24:28,391 --> 00:24:30,325
- But it's my album.
- Okay, look,

567
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,327
if you're really
into doing a duet,

568
00:24:32,362 --> 00:24:35,097
let me make some phone calls,
let me call in some favors,

569
00:24:35,131 --> 00:24:37,566
let me get you with Katy,
let me get you with Carly,

570
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,968
let me get you with Alicia.
Let me get you with someone

571
00:24:40,003 --> 00:24:41,903
more famous than you
that can actually help you,

572
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:44,373
and Santana can sing backup.

573
00:24:44,407 --> 00:24:46,375
And if everything goes
like it's supposed to,

574
00:24:46,409 --> 00:24:47,943
then we revisit this

575
00:24:47,977 --> 00:24:49,544
on your follow-up album.

576
00:24:49,579 --> 00:24:50,879
SANTANA:
Yeah, you know what?

577
00:24:50,914 --> 00:24:51,947
I think that he's right.

578
00:24:51,981 --> 00:24:53,782
This is your big chance,

579
00:24:53,816 --> 00:24:55,450
and it should be
all about you, you know?

580
00:24:55,485 --> 00:24:58,053
And I really appreciate what
you tried to do for me here,

581
00:24:58,087 --> 00:25:00,589
but I know what I would do
if I was in your position.

582
00:25:00,623 --> 00:25:02,124
I'm just not worth it.

583
00:25:02,926 --> 00:25:03,859
Santana...

584
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:09,364
(coughing)

585
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:11,300
(hoarsely):
Sidney... (groans)

586
00:25:11,334 --> 00:25:14,102
I know I said I would
never miss a show, but...

587
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:17,806
(coughs) I just saw my doctor,
and he said that I have the flu.

588
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,310
- The flu? Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- I know... I was starting to feel run-down.

589
00:25:21,344 --> 00:25:24,179
Why does this always, always
happen to me?

590
00:25:24,213 --> 00:25:27,115
I'm sorry. Do you think
my understudy Wendy can do it?

591
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:31,320
(panting) Well, if I
have to, uh, I have to.

592
00:25:31,354 --> 00:25:33,855
But, uh, nobody can replace you,
Rachala.

593
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,857
You're my... you're my star,
you're my show.

594
00:25:35,892 --> 00:25:38,126
I-I'm gargling
with a magical mouthwash,

595
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:41,730
and-and I'm-I'm gonna dry up
my sinuses with a humidifier,

596
00:25:41,764 --> 00:25:44,733
and I will do my absolute best
to be better in 24 hours.

597
00:25:44,767 --> 00:25:46,034
(coughing)

598
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:54,647
PAULBLATT:
Ah. (chuckles)

599
00:25:54,672 --> 00:25:56,306
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Rachel Berry,

600
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,909
- who is taking Broadway by storm.
- Hello.

601
00:25:58,943 --> 00:26:01,878
Uh, this is Andrew Cosgrove.
He is our Captain Solomon.

602
00:26:01,913 --> 00:26:02,946
Hi. I'm Rachel Berry. Hi.

603
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,247
- Rachel, you ready?
- You bet.

604
00:26:04,282 --> 00:26:06,762
Ah.
(chuckles)

605
00:26:06,784 --> 00:26:09,853
Hello. I'm Rachel Berry,
and I will be singing

606
00:26:09,887 --> 00:26:12,656

Yes.

- Uh, that was beautiful,
- Thank you.

644
00:28:32,263 --> 00:28:34,097
um, but we-we really don't

645
00:28:34,132 --> 00:28:35,032
need you to sing.

646
00:28:35,066 --> 00:28:36,400
- Oh?
- Yeah,

647
00:28:36,434 --> 00:28:38,235
this show is not a musical.

648
00:28:38,269 --> 00:28:40,270
Did you not read

649
00:28:40,304 --> 00:28:41,872
the script?

650
00:28:41,906 --> 00:28:44,107
I'm-I'm sorry. I-I didn't...
I didn't get a script.

651
00:28:44,108 --> 00:28:46,877
- I just saw the title, <i>The
Song of Solomon.</i> - Oh, Rachel,

652
00:28:46,911 --> 00:28:49,680
that's my bad. I'm going
to fire my assistant.

653
00:28:49,714 --> 00:28:50,747
<i>Song of Solomon</i>

654
00:28:50,782 --> 00:28:52,749
is a sci-fi space opera.

655
00:28:52,784 --> 00:28:54,851
- Oh. Okay.
- Andrew here plays

656
00:28:54,886 --> 00:28:57,220
Captain Dax Anderss,
uh, who pilots his ship,

657
00:28:57,255 --> 00:28:59,823
the<i> Solomon,</i>
across the Andromeda Galaxy

658
00:28:59,857 --> 00:29:02,259
with, uh, Galadriel
the Starmorian... that's you...

659
00:29:02,293 --> 00:29:04,094
- Okay.
- ... searching for the Drax Flute,

660
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,562
- Right.
- ... which he needs to use

661
00:29:05,596 --> 00:29:07,698
to play a song implanted
in his head by his father

662
00:29:07,732 --> 00:29:10,233
that he believes
will open a wormhole

663
00:29:10,268 --> 00:29:11,702
back to his home planet.

664
00:29:11,736 --> 00:29:13,403
- Okay! Yeah.
- Okay.

665
00:29:13,438 --> 00:29:15,405
It's sort of like
<i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i>

666
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,040
meets<i> Game of Thrones.</i>

667
00:29:17,075 --> 00:29:18,041
- Okay.
- With a strong

668
00:29:18,076 --> 00:29:20,711
<i>Grey's Anatomy</i> element.

669
00:29:20,745 --> 00:29:23,714
Yeah. That's what mostly...
really excited about that.

670
00:29:23,748 --> 00:29:25,282
Great. Love that show.

671
00:29:25,316 --> 00:29:26,450
Andrew, let's take it
from, uh...

672
00:29:26,484 --> 00:29:27,584
Let's just try the first scene

673
00:29:27,618 --> 00:29:29,052
in the engine room, okay?

674
00:29:29,087 --> 00:29:31,388
Great.
(chuckles) Okay.

675
00:29:31,422 --> 00:29:34,458
(mimicking spaceship sounds)

676
00:29:34,492 --> 00:29:36,660
You gonna just stand there,
or are you gonna pass me

677
00:29:36,694 --> 00:29:39,262
the warp-core?

678
00:29:41,766 --> 00:29:45,168
- Would you care to explain
what went on back there?
- Oh, don't

679
00:29:45,203 --> 00:29:46,770
play coy, Galadriel.

680
00:29:46,804 --> 00:29:48,905
You Starmorians may like to beat
around the bush,

681
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,241
but I always prefer
a straight shooter.

682
00:29:51,275 --> 00:29:53,410
Then let me be perfectly clear.

683
00:29:53,444 --> 00:29:56,546
I am not just some space trash

684
00:29:56,581 --> 00:30:00,117
you picked up
in the Triangulum Sector.

685
00:30:00,151 --> 00:30:03,253
I am a princess
of the royal house of...

686
00:30:03,287 --> 00:30:05,922
I'm sorry, Antrya...

687
00:30:05,957 --> 00:30:08,091
- Antyrexx, but make it your own. Stay in it.
- Antyrexx. I'm just gonna

688
00:30:08,126 --> 00:30:10,160
- pass by it. We'll talk about it later.
- Okay.

689
00:30:10,194 --> 00:30:13,630
I am not the last...
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.

690
00:30:13,665 --> 00:30:17,167
I-I<i> am</i> the last Starmorian,

691
00:30:17,201 --> 00:30:19,269
and I will not risk my life

692
00:30:19,304 --> 00:30:21,538
and the future of my people

693
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:24,141
because of some dream
locked in your head

694
00:30:24,175 --> 00:30:25,809
and a flute...

695
00:30:25,843 --> 00:30:28,345
and a flute
that will never avenge

696
00:30:28,379 --> 00:30:32,249
the destruction of my planet.

697
00:30:34,018 --> 00:30:37,287
Lately, I've only dreamt
of one thing.

698
00:30:37,322 --> 00:30:39,823
And that's doing this.

699
00:30:40,858 --> 00:30:42,859
Mmm.

700
00:30:45,296 --> 00:30:46,263
Mmm.

701
00:30:46,297 --> 00:30:48,031
(Rachel chuckles)

702
00:30:48,066 --> 00:30:49,599
Okay, uh...

703
00:30:49,634 --> 00:30:52,169
- next scene?
- No, thank you so much, Rachel.

704
00:30:52,203 --> 00:30:53,670
So, so great.

705
00:30:53,705 --> 00:30:55,505
I think, uh... yeah,

706
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,574
I think that we've seen
all we need to see.

707
00:30:57,608 --> 00:30:59,710
Great. Thank you.

708
00:30:59,744 --> 00:31:01,745
Okay.
(chuckles)

709
00:31:03,214 --> 00:31:05,349
I can't believe it.

710
00:31:05,383 --> 00:31:07,851
That was seriously
the worst audition ever.

711
00:31:07,885 --> 00:31:09,720
(sighs)

712
00:31:09,754 --> 00:31:11,188
What?

713
00:31:11,222 --> 00:31:13,023
(line ringing)

714
00:31:13,057 --> 00:31:14,558
- Rachel.
- Hi, Sidney.

715
00:31:14,592 --> 00:31:17,027
Look, before you say anything,
I just... I felt really bad

716
00:31:17,061 --> 00:31:19,296
after our last conversation,
and, you know,

717
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,832
I want to reiterate to you
my commitment to Broadway

718
00:31:21,866 --> 00:31:23,900
and to the show,
and-and I wanted to tell you

719
00:31:23,935 --> 00:31:26,303
what-what an honor
it is working for you

720
00:31:26,337 --> 00:31:28,572
and-and being in<i> Funny Girl.</i>
And, you know, I was thinking

721
00:31:28,606 --> 00:31:30,774
about playing Fanny night
after night after night,

722
00:31:30,808 --> 00:31:34,278
and I honestly... I just...
it made me feel so much better.

723
00:31:34,312 --> 00:31:37,915
Oh, I'm so relieved. I'm so
relieved to hear that, Rachel.

724
00:31:37,949 --> 00:31:41,385
Listen, um, your understudy
today during rehearsal

725
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:43,899
fell off the lip of the stage.

726
00:31:44,455 --> 00:31:47,024
- You fell off the lip of the stage.
- (crying): Oh, no...

727
00:31:47,058 --> 00:31:49,059
Now, look,
hydrate yourself, okay?

728
00:31:49,093 --> 00:31:51,595
And then come
to the theater, 7:30.

729
00:31:53,097 --> 00:31:54,932
Oh, my God.

730
00:31:54,966 --> 00:31:56,400
Oh, my God.

731
00:31:56,434 --> 00:31:58,068
Oh, no. Taxi?

732
00:31:58,102 --> 00:31:59,569
Taxi!

733
00:31:59,604 --> 00:32:01,305
Taxi!

734
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:02,940
Take me to the airport!

735
00:32:06,671 --> 00:32:08,279
So I said to Prince Faisal,

736
00:32:08,313 --> 00:32:11,849
"What do you think this is,
a quarter horse convention?"

737
00:32:11,883 --> 00:32:14,084
I want to be you when I grow up.

738
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:15,619
Why? What do you find
so attractive?

739
00:32:15,654 --> 00:32:17,688
Tell me. Is it the fame?

740
00:32:17,722 --> 00:32:18,823
Is it the power?

741
00:32:18,857 --> 00:32:20,157
Is it the money? What is it?

742
00:32:20,192 --> 00:32:21,826
No, it's-it's the life.

743
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,361
I mean, how did you manage
to find yourself

744
00:32:24,396 --> 00:32:26,397
in the center of all of it?

745
00:32:26,431 --> 00:32:28,732
You attract in what you put out.

746
00:32:28,767 --> 00:32:31,602
So if you put out charisma

747
00:32:31,636 --> 00:32:33,337
to every person you meet,

748
00:32:33,371 --> 00:32:36,107
the universe will see to it
that it comes back to you.

749
00:32:36,141 --> 00:32:38,642
Because like attracts like.

750
00:32:38,677 --> 00:32:41,846
That's why I'm so in like
with you.

751
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,681
Oh, my God. I just...

752
00:32:43,715 --> 00:32:45,755
I can't believe
that you see me that way.

753
00:32:45,784 --> 00:32:47,618
Okay, so we're going
to do a show,

754
00:32:47,652 --> 00:32:49,120
showcase your talent.

755
00:32:49,154 --> 00:32:50,855
It'll be the biggest event
the whole year.

756
00:32:50,889 --> 00:32:52,857
Thank you. Thank you so much.

757
00:32:52,891 --> 00:32:55,092
That-that's huge.

758
00:32:55,127 --> 00:32:57,828
I just want to shine a light
on what the world should see.

759
00:32:57,863 --> 00:32:59,497
Well, I-I would just have
one request.

760
00:32:59,531 --> 00:33:01,999
I would love it
if we could have Kurt

761
00:33:02,033 --> 00:33:04,902
in the show, too. We really
want to do everything together,

762
00:33:04,936 --> 00:33:06,570
and I think that the world
really needs

763
00:33:06,605 --> 00:33:08,539
to see his talent, too.

764
00:33:08,573 --> 00:33:12,009
No, I don't think
the world needs to see that.

765
00:33:12,043 --> 00:33:15,079
Well, then I-I don't think
I could do it.

766
00:33:15,113 --> 00:33:16,480
Stop.

767
00:33:16,515 --> 00:33:18,516
Blaine, I've been in
and out of love

768
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,518
more times
than you've had breakfast.

769
00:33:20,552 --> 00:33:22,820
I know you're not
asking me this,

770
00:33:22,854 --> 00:33:24,655
but I am telling you.

771
00:33:24,689 --> 00:33:26,357
You should break off
that engagement.

772
00:33:26,391 --> 00:33:28,993
I love Kurt.

773
00:33:29,027 --> 00:33:30,161
Well, of course you do.

774
00:33:30,195 --> 00:33:31,695
I loved Richard Burton
and Howard Hughes.

775
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:32,863
(laughs)

776
00:33:32,898 --> 00:33:35,032
So what?
That's what we humans do.

777
00:33:35,067 --> 00:33:36,734
We fall in and out of love.

778
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,102
We break each other's hearts.

779
00:33:38,136 --> 00:33:41,272
The first time, you always think
it's the most important,

780
00:33:41,306 --> 00:33:42,740
but that isn't true.

781
00:33:42,774 --> 00:33:44,842
It's the test.

782
00:33:44,876 --> 00:33:46,944
So you have to make a decision.

783
00:33:46,978 --> 00:33:48,713
Are you gonna settle,

784
00:33:48,747 --> 00:33:51,248
or are you going
to venture out into the unknown

785
00:33:51,283 --> 00:33:55,219
like a samurai,
and realize your full, full

786
00:33:55,253 --> 00:33:57,822
potential?

787
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:03,694
Excuse me, sir.
Why is there a traffic jam?

788
00:34:03,729 --> 00:34:05,329
Because there's always
a traffic jam.

789
00:34:05,363 --> 00:34:06,731
Interesting story.

790
00:34:06,765 --> 00:34:09,367
In 1950s, all the
hot-shot automakers

791
00:34:09,401 --> 00:34:12,970
allegedly banded together and
got rid of the trolley cars.

792
00:34:13,004 --> 00:34:14,438
And that's what inspired
<i>Who Framed Roger Rabbit?</i>

793
00:34:14,473 --> 00:34:15,606
- Uh, I'm sorry.
- Remember that?

794
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,874
(mutters) Excuse me.

795
00:34:16,908 --> 00:34:18,743
I have to make a flight
at the airport,

796
00:34:18,777 --> 00:34:19,910
10:00 a.m. to New York.

797
00:34:19,945 --> 00:34:21,712
I have to make it.
I'm in a Broadway show.

798
00:34:21,747 --> 00:34:22,880
I have to get there.

799
00:34:22,914 --> 00:34:24,048
Yeah, not gonna happen.

800
00:34:24,082 --> 00:34:25,683
Hey, I'm an actor, too.

801
00:34:25,717 --> 00:34:27,618
I played a john
on<i> The Client List.</i>

802
00:34:27,652 --> 00:34:29,020
This seat belt is stuck.

803
00:34:29,054 --> 00:34:31,756
Hey, girl. How's it going?

804
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:34,558
Oh, my God, Kurt, I am dead.
I am so dead right now.

805
00:34:34,593 --> 00:34:36,160
Okay, Sidney is expecting
me at the theater,

806
00:34:36,194 --> 00:34:37,328
and my understudy
cannot get on,

807
00:34:37,362 --> 00:34:38,629
and-and I'm not
gonna make it

808
00:34:38,663 --> 00:34:40,097
until after the curtain goes up.

809
00:34:40,132 --> 00:34:41,532
Well, this is a disaster!

810
00:34:41,566 --> 00:34:44,168
You have to call Sidney right
now and tell him the truth!

811
00:34:44,202 --> 00:34:47,104
What? No! And-and ruin my TV and
my Broadway career all at once?

812
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:49,019
Kurt, you have
to help me! Please!

813
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:54,578
(clears her throat)

814
00:34:56,014 --> 00:34:57,415
What is that?

815
00:34:57,449 --> 00:35:00,785
It's a contract,
and you need to sign it

816
00:35:00,819 --> 00:35:03,654
so that we can get to work
on our duet.

817
00:35:03,689 --> 00:35:05,690
Okay, you know what?
You are literally insane.

818
00:35:05,724 --> 00:35:07,825
You need to take this
contract, rip it up,

819
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:10,961
apologize to D'Shon and
do that song by yourself.

820
00:35:10,996 --> 00:35:13,497
Listen, I want my album
to be the best,

821
00:35:13,532 --> 00:35:15,866
and, Santana,
you make me better.

822
00:35:15,901 --> 00:35:18,469
Rachel... she's great,
but we both know

823
00:35:18,503 --> 00:35:20,371
who the top bitches
of that glee club were.

824
00:35:20,405 --> 00:35:22,106
Point taken.

825
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,808
And I want to help you.

826
00:35:23,842 --> 00:35:26,243
Yeah, but, see, um,
I think that I've proven

827
00:35:26,278 --> 00:35:27,945
that I'm not
the world's best friend.

828
00:35:27,979 --> 00:35:29,914
You might be
a work in progress,

829
00:35:29,948 --> 00:35:32,083
but I think
you're worth the wait.

830
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,988
You know, this is
the nicest thing

831
00:35:37,022 --> 00:35:38,589
that anyone has ever
done for me.

832
00:35:38,623 --> 00:35:40,157
I know. I'm awesome, huh?

833
00:35:40,192 --> 00:35:42,293
Do either of you

834
00:35:42,327 --> 00:35:43,361
look at your phone?

835
00:35:43,395 --> 00:35:45,196
Rachel is stuck in L.A., okay?

836
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,365
We have to delay tonight's
performance until she gets back.

837
00:35:47,399 --> 00:35:49,000
Okay, I'm thinking maybe
like a bomb threat,

838
00:35:49,034 --> 00:35:51,369
or maybe like
a bed bug scare, or...

839
00:35:51,403 --> 00:35:53,037
or maybe I run out
in the lobby, and I'm, like,

840
00:35:53,071 --> 00:35:55,006
"Hey, Barbra's in the park, and
she's doing a concert for free!"

841
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,041
Please stop. Just stop.
All of your ideas are horrible.

842
00:35:57,075 --> 00:35:58,542
Well, do you have a better one?
Because, I mean,

843
00:35:58,577 --> 00:36:00,897
if Rachel doesn't get back
in time, she could get fired!

844
00:36:04,016 --> 00:36:05,983
No one is gonna get fired.

845
00:36:06,018 --> 00:36:08,386
And yes, I actually
do have a better idea.

846
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:12,065
BARCLAY:
Ooh! What a night, right?

847
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:13,157
Hold that. Um,

848
00:36:13,191 --> 00:36:14,325
I didn't want to alarm you,

849
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:15,559
but I didn't know
who else to call.

850
00:36:15,594 --> 00:36:16,727
How is this possible?

851
00:36:16,762 --> 00:36:19,130
Um, she's right in there.

852
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,901
What the hell
are you doing here?

853
00:36:23,935 --> 00:36:25,503
I'm going on as Fanny.

854
00:36:25,537 --> 00:36:27,672
I thought you quit.

855
00:36:27,706 --> 00:36:29,573
I guess I could quit again
if you want

856
00:36:29,608 --> 00:36:31,742
to spend the next couple
of hours handing out refunds.

857
00:36:31,777 --> 00:36:32,877
Where's Rachel?

858
00:36:32,911 --> 00:36:34,912
She's not here, but...

859
00:36:34,946 --> 00:36:38,649
I am, and trust me,
Sidney, I've got this.

860
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:43,434
So, I figured I'd kill two birds
with one stone

861
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:45,302
by thanking you for keeping me
from getting fired

862
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:48,313
and humiliated by making sure
the show wasn't canceled.

863
00:36:48,341 --> 00:36:50,375
I cannot believe they
didn't can you anyway.

864
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:51,676
Yeah, well, they still might.

865
00:36:51,711 --> 00:36:53,011
I e-mailed Rupert and Sidney

866
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:54,713
and explained
the whole situation to them,

867
00:36:54,747 --> 00:36:56,648
and all I got back
was an e-mail saying

868
00:36:56,682 --> 00:36:59,084
that I had to come in for
a mandatory meeting tomorrow.

869
00:36:59,118 --> 00:37:00,485
You're so screwed.

870
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,753
Yeah. Well, I mean,
I don't know.

871
00:37:01,788 --> 00:37:03,455
At least I'm not going to be,
like, sued or anything

872
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:05,056
for all of the tickets
that they would have had

873
00:37:05,091 --> 00:37:06,358
to refund if the show
had been canceled.

874
00:37:06,392 --> 00:37:07,953
Don't sweat it.
I had a blast, actually.

875
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,227
I mean,
that Broadway stuff is fun

876
00:37:09,262 --> 00:37:10,829
if you only have to do it once.

877
00:37:10,863 --> 00:37:13,865
So, what's the,
uh, second bird?

878
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,635
Well, I mean, I wanted to see
what you wanted in return.

879
00:37:16,669 --> 00:37:19,237
Is that the kind of friend
that you think that I am?

880
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:23,375
Yeah. Okay.
Look, I get it.

881
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:25,944
I get how
I could come off that way,

882
00:37:25,978 --> 00:37:28,914
but let's just use this
as an example

883
00:37:28,948 --> 00:37:31,249
of the kind of friend
that I'm trying to be now.

884
00:37:31,284 --> 00:37:33,251
Okay.

885
00:37:33,286 --> 00:37:36,288
Well, why the sudden thawing
of your icy heart?

886
00:37:36,322 --> 00:37:38,557
Well, because I realized

887
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:41,059
that the world is even colder
than I am.

888
00:37:41,094 --> 00:37:43,395
You know, and the only thing
that you can do

889
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:45,063
to keep from freezing
to death is

890
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:47,165
have good friends around you
to keep you warm.

891
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,701
So, I decided
that I want to use

892
00:37:49,735 --> 00:37:53,105
my bitch powers to protect
the people that I care about.

893
00:37:53,139 --> 00:37:56,241
And I guess that means
that I care about you.

894
00:37:56,275 --> 00:37:58,243
Don't tell anyone.

895
00:37:58,277 --> 00:37:59,911
I won't.

896
00:37:59,946 --> 00:38:02,114
- Okay.
- I made it in time

897
00:38:02,148 --> 00:38:04,883
for the second act,
and you were really good.

898
00:38:04,917 --> 00:38:07,152
Thanks.

899
00:38:07,186 --> 00:38:09,588
(sighs)

900
00:38:09,622 --> 00:38:12,057
I just can't believe
I screwed it all up.

901
00:38:12,091 --> 00:38:15,627
I mean, I had everything, and

902
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:18,964
all my dreams had come true,

903
00:38:18,998 --> 00:38:21,600
and I threw it away.

904
00:38:21,634 --> 00:38:23,602
And for what?

905
00:38:23,636 --> 00:38:25,203
Nothing.

906
00:38:25,238 --> 00:38:28,373
Listen, I don't know what Sidney
is going to do to you tomorrow.

907
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:30,242
Maybe he'll fire you.

908
00:38:30,276 --> 00:38:32,244
I know I would.

909
00:38:32,278 --> 00:38:35,380
But I also know
that you are the type of person

910
00:38:35,414 --> 00:38:37,883
that can't be held down.

911
00:38:37,917 --> 00:38:39,284
You're this huge talent.

912
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:42,254
It's like Russell Crowe
and Johnny Carson.

913
00:38:42,288 --> 00:38:43,855
No matter how awful you are,

914
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:46,010
people are always gonna want
to work with you.

915
00:38:47,226 --> 00:38:49,294
That was kind of nice,
I think, but...

916
00:38:52,165 --> 00:38:54,766
You're a really good friend,
Santana.

917
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:01,673
Oh, I'm gonna take this
all for myself.

918
00:39:01,707 --> 00:39:03,341
(laughter)

919
00:39:03,376 --> 00:39:07,145
Finally, I get some alone time
with you on the couch.

920
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,647
I feel like
I haven't seen you in days.

921
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:10,882
Well, you keep telling me
never to say no to June.

922
00:39:10,883 --> 00:39:12,818
Well, you never know
who she might introduce you to

923
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:14,186
who could help us
in our careers.

924
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,921
I mean, literally, all
her friends are rich and famous.

925
00:39:15,955 --> 00:39:17,789
By the way, I'm upset with you.

926
00:39:17,824 --> 00:39:20,192
- Why?
- Because

927
00:39:20,226 --> 00:39:21,827
you haven't filled me in
on any of the gossip.

928
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:23,862
You spend six hours
a day with her,

929
00:39:23,896 --> 00:39:25,864
and I have yet
to receive one text being, like,

930
00:39:25,898 --> 00:39:28,700
"Hey, I'm talking poverty
with Bono," or-or tales

931
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:31,303
of lunch at Balthazar with
Karl Lagerfeld or Condi Rice.

932
00:39:31,337 --> 00:39:32,971
It's not like that at all.

933
00:39:33,005 --> 00:39:34,773
It's-it's just me and June.

934
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:36,208
Well, is-is she being
inappropriate?

935
00:39:36,242 --> 00:39:37,476
Because I draw a line.

936
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:40,979
What? No. Gross.
Not at all.

937
00:39:41,013 --> 00:39:42,047
Then what is it?

938
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:49,788
Um, well, we're, um,
planning a... a show.

939
00:39:49,822 --> 00:39:52,124
It's just like
a one-night-only showcase.

940
00:39:52,158 --> 00:39:53,525
Oh, my God, that's amazing!

941
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:55,327
Why didn't you tell me?

942
00:39:55,361 --> 00:40:00,365
I just wanted to make sure that
your part was more fleshed out.

943
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:02,000
I get to be in it?!

944
00:40:02,034 --> 00:40:03,502
But I-I thought she hated me.

945
00:40:03,536 --> 00:40:05,570
Well, she doesn't hate you.

946
00:40:05,605 --> 00:40:06,972
You're such a sweetheart!

947
00:40:07,006 --> 00:40:08,473
Oh, like, okay, okay.

948
00:40:08,508 --> 00:40:11,376
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to ruin the surprise.

949
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,312
Oh, okay, I'm not gonna
ask you anything else, but

950
00:40:14,347 --> 00:40:15,714
I am... I am dying to know

951
00:40:15,748 --> 00:40:16,848
what I'll be doing.

952
00:40:16,883 --> 00:40:19,084
Oh, I love you so much.
Oh.

953
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,721
(knocks)

954
00:40:23,756 --> 00:40:25,757
Rachel, have a seat.

955
00:40:29,195 --> 00:40:33,198
Mr. Greene, I just...
I really wanted to apologize

956
00:40:33,232 --> 00:40:34,966
for how everything turned out.

957
00:40:35,001 --> 00:40:36,668
Oh, please. It's okay.

958
00:40:36,702 --> 00:40:41,106
As you young people say,
"I totally understand."

959
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,541
- Really?
- Yeah.

960
00:40:42,575 --> 00:40:44,543
I mean, you wanted out
of a performance,

961
00:40:44,577 --> 00:40:47,612
and I told you "no"
in no uncertain terms.

962
00:40:47,647 --> 00:40:49,781
(sighs)
Mr. Greene...

963
00:40:49,816 --> 00:40:51,850
Let me finish.

964
00:40:51,884 --> 00:40:54,219
You lied to me.

965
00:40:54,253 --> 00:40:56,855
You know, I'm disappointed.

966
00:40:56,889 --> 00:40:58,356
Now, I personally
feel betrayed.

967
00:40:58,391 --> 00:41:00,292
But I'm not going to fire you.

968
00:41:00,326 --> 00:41:02,461
- Oh. Really?
- No.

969
00:41:02,495 --> 00:41:05,730
I wanted to fire you.

970
00:41:05,765 --> 00:41:08,133
I spent all day
<i>trying</i> to fire you.

971
00:41:08,167 --> 00:41:11,670
I spoke to Rupert,
the other investors,

972
00:41:11,704 --> 00:41:13,405
and they all agreed

973
00:41:13,439 --> 00:41:16,475
that you're an ambitious,
irresponsible child.

974
00:41:16,509 --> 00:41:18,176
What can we do?

975
00:41:18,211 --> 00:41:21,146
You're our star.
We need you.

976
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:25,016
Well, Mr. Greene, I...
I know I made a mistake,

977
00:41:25,051 --> 00:41:27,018
but I had an opportunity
come my way,

978
00:41:27,053 --> 00:41:28,553
and I just... I thought...

979
00:41:28,588 --> 00:41:33,658
Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm,
mm-hmm, mm-hmm, you thought.

980
00:41:33,693 --> 00:41:35,794
I've seen this all the time,

981
00:41:35,828 --> 00:41:37,963
and let me tell you
something, Miss Berry.

982
00:41:37,997 --> 00:41:40,732
You aren't some Broadway legend.

983
00:41:40,767 --> 00:41:43,835
If you ever

984
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:46,004
pull something like this again,

985
00:41:46,038 --> 00:41:48,140
I will not only fire you;

986
00:41:48,174 --> 00:41:50,509
I will sue you back
to the stone age

987
00:41:50,543 --> 00:41:52,511
for breach of contract.

988
00:41:52,545 --> 00:41:57,649
And you'll never be able
to work on Broadway again.

989
00:41:57,683 --> 00:41:59,451
Your reputation...

990
00:41:59,485 --> 00:42:01,486
will not exist.

991
00:42:04,057 --> 00:42:06,758
Get the hell out of my office.

992
00:42:13,399 --> 00:42:15,367
(crying)

993
00:42:15,401 --> 00:42:17,169
(sighs, phone buzzing)

994
00:42:17,203 --> 00:42:18,603
(sniffles)

995
00:42:18,638 --> 00:42:20,605
Hello?

996
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,375
Hi, Rachel. Lee Paulblatt.

997
00:42:23,409 --> 00:42:25,911
Yeah, I've got some bad news.

998
00:42:25,945 --> 00:42:28,413
As you're aware, that, uh,
was not a great audition.

999
00:42:28,448 --> 00:42:30,408
There were some girls
who just came in

1000
00:42:30,416 --> 00:42:32,250
and knocked it
out of the park, so,

1001
00:42:32,285 --> 00:42:33,418
the bottom line is that,

1002
00:42:33,453 --> 00:42:34,619
unfortunately,
you did not get the part.

1003
00:42:34,654 --> 00:42:36,254
I know, Mr. Paulblatt.

1004
00:42:36,289 --> 00:42:38,023
Thank you for the opportunity.

1005
00:42:38,057 --> 00:42:40,358
But I've also got
some good news.

1006
00:42:40,393 --> 00:42:41,760
Rachel, I mean, clearly,

1007
00:42:41,794 --> 00:42:43,829
<i>Song of Solomon</i> was not
the right project for you.

1008
00:42:43,863 --> 00:42:45,397
But when I said that you were

1009
00:42:45,431 --> 00:42:47,265
a once-in-a-generation talent,
I meant it,

1010
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,569
which is why I want
to give you a development deal.

1011
00:42:50,603 --> 00:42:51,970
Are you serious?

1012
00:42:52,004 --> 00:42:54,406
I don't... I don't even know
what that means.

1013
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,042
We want to create a TV show
around you, Rachel.

1014
00:42:57,076 --> 00:42:58,577
We don't know what it is,

1015
00:42:58,611 --> 00:43:00,612
but, uh, oh,
we'll figure that out.

1016
00:43:00,646 --> 00:43:01,980
Are you serious?

1017
00:43:02,014 --> 00:43:03,348
Yes, Rachel, I am serious.

1018
00:43:03,382 --> 00:43:05,917
I've got a writer in mind
I want to pair you with.

1019
00:43:05,952 --> 00:43:07,586
You don't even have
to leave New York.

1020
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:08,920
We're sending her to you.

1021
00:43:08,955 --> 00:43:12,457
Mr. Paulblatt, I... I..
I-I don't even know what to say.

1022
00:43:12,492 --> 00:43:13,792
Just say thank you.
Congrats, Rachel.

1023
00:43:13,826 --> 00:43:17,014
Celebrate with your friends.
We'll be in touch.
