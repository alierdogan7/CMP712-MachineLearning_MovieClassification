1
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:45,108
- Is that him?
- Yes.

2
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:49,004
Doesn't look like a killer.

3
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:54,784
Your timing's bad, pal.
I'm off on holiday later.

4
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:56,649
With this weather...

5
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,656
I need a bit of sunshine.

6
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:04,520
Name?

7
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:07,327
Pigoil.

8
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,093
- First name?
- Germain.

9
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,299
They call me Pigoil.

10
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,636
Place of birth?

11
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:18,405
The Faubourg.

12
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:19,869
Which one?

13
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,310
The Faubourg. There's only one.

14
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,368
A unique show in Paris. Unique!.

15
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:49,702
On the Faubourg
and at the Chansonia tonight.

16
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:53,039
An unforgettable
New Year's Eve spectacular!.

17
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,909
Songs, magic,
laughter, pretty women!

18
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:59,574
Starring Line Andrieux,
Réjax and that lady- killer...

19
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,549
...Tony Nightingale!

20
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:04,349
All for 4 francs in the stalls...

21
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:05,991
...and 3 in the circle.

22
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,854
Hurry, it's starting!

23
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:11,326
You're not interested?
Are you sure?

24
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,659
Roll up, it's a wonderful show!

25
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,528
Pigoil, you're late!

26
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,602
- I know.
- You're never late.

27
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,206
- Seen Jojo?
- Not yet. How's my new jacket?

28
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:22,965
- Ugly.
- Ugly?

29
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,270
I wanted to wear it for my debut.

30
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:26,434
Yeah, do that.

31
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:27,841
It won't be long now!

32
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:30,244
I'll be the prince of imitators!

33
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,281
Why not the king?

34
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,348
Evening, Pigoil.

35
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:39,221
They're looking for you.
Milou's caused a rumpus again.

36
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,087
Surprised?

37
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:43,423
Get the program!

38
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:48,127
- Not much of a crowd.
- It's not bad.

39
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,439
- Hi.
- All right?

40
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:56,234
Hey, Blaise, tonight.

41
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:01,736
Don't you "Milou" me.
We're sick of it!

42
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:05,140
- Let me speak.
- ls Dorfeuil dreaming?

43
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:08,378
- I'll talk to him.
- He thinks we're rolling in it?

44
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,046
We get paid tomorrow and no later!

45
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,954
Or we'll go on strike. We all agree!

46
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,925
No, we don't all agree
and you know it.

47
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:19,496
People, we're running late.

48
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,260
Think of the audience.

49
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:26,094
Tomorrow and no later!

50
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,607
Here we go.

51
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,239
- Honey, seen Jojo?
- No. Why?

52
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,311
Mind my makeup.

53
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,640
I have a surprise for you both.

54
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,339
- Am I beautiful?
- You bet.

55
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,116
Welcome to the Chansonia.

56
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,658
This evening, a dazzling show...

57
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,592
...designed to enchant.
New Year's Eve...

58
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:54,096
...a program by Louis Dorfeuil...

59
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,703
It looks bad
when you contradict me like that.

60
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,703
- Your politics wear us out.
- My politics?

61
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,532
It's about workers' rights.

62
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:05,974
I've been here 35 years,
six days a week, 60 hours a week.

63
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,271
I never complain.

64
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,472
- You're proud of that?
- Yes.

65
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:12,345
- Milou, get into place.
- All right.

66
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,579
Us others love this dump too.

67
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,621
His name?
You'll guess when I say...

68
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,281
...he sings like an angel.

69
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,223
All men envy him...

70
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:26,229
...and all women are mad about him.
Yes, it's him...

71
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,201
...Tony Nightingale!

72
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:39,072
I wait till her street is in shadow

73
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,839
And every door has been closed

74
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,677
Until all the stars have faded

75
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,183
Into the collusive sky

76
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:56,161
Beneath

77
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,957
Beneath M\aria 's balcony

78
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,500
I wait for M\aria to see me

79
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,669
If she sees me

80
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:13,943
Evening, Dorfeuil.

81
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,774
Stop!

82
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:20,680
This isn't nice!

83
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,184
I hate hurting others.

84
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:23,816
I can't, Galapiat.

85
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,555
Not right away. Give me more time.

86
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,826
Take your time if you want.

87
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,087
But not mine.

88
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,863
Pay me back by midnight
and I'll tear this up.

89
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,235
If not, the Chansonia is mine.

90
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:49,377
Curtains. Everyone on the dole.

91
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,779
Demolition, reconstruction.

92
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,616
Prime real estate.

93
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,087
This theater is my life.

94
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,282
I won't wish you a happy New Year.

95
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:04,123
It's bad luck before midnight.

96
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,227
- Seen Viviane?
- No.

97
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,738
I wait for M\aria to see me

98
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:17,608
Come in, silly.

99
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,335
If she sees me

100
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,306
Why

101
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,110
- You knew it was me?
- Why are you here?

102
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:28,978
- And you?
- Tony is letting me change in here.

103
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,684
You're modest now?

104
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,425
I have a surprise.

105
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:36,153
I went to the travel agency.

106
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,263
Look, the sea.
We'll go for a week with Jojo.

107
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:41,593
Let's talk later.

108
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,429
It's me, my love!

109
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:46,968
Sorry.

110
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:52,801
Germain...

111
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:54,640
...we need to talk.

112
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,041
What?

113
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:58,149
- With Nightingale?
- Yes.

114
00:06:58,317 --> 00:06:59,682
The slut.

115
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,912
I don't believe it. What a slut!

116
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,287
What's wrong?

117
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,018
- You almost seem jealous.
- I am.

118
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,889
I mean...

119
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:12,326
...jealous for your sake.

120
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,431
Excuse me, l- -

121
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,368
Viviane and Nightingale?
Any connection?

122
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,030
They've been connecting, all right.

123
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,334
- Never.
- What about Milou?

124
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:26,807
Are they at it too?

125
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,148
See, it looks better here.

126
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,750
It's more an indoor jacket.

127
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,884
My wife sleeps around
and only your jacket matters?

128
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,713
Where's Pigoil?

129
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,685
- No idea.
- He has to do the curtain.

130
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,824
Pigoil!

131
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:47,855
What's up?

132
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,970
You go fast, Jojo. Very fast.

133
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,440
Much too fast. Start again.

134
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,545
Three times slower.

135
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:29,966
Is that you, son?

136
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:31,769
- Where were you?
- At Radio Man's.

137
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,879
Again? Stop going there.
You know he's...

138
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:37,811
- He helps with my homework.
- No reason.

139
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,452
Why are you out here?

140
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,883
I needed some air.

141
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,387
- Can I go and see Mom?
- Yes.

142
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,048
No. Wait.

143
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:53,897
And...one!

144
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,360
Goodbye, 1935.

145
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,636
Nine!

146
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:05,838
Three!

147
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:10,275
Six!

148
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,118
Nineteen thirty- six!

149
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:14,745
Happy New Year!

150
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:21,988
PARlS 36

151
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:24,562
The results of the election
of M\ay 3, 1936...

152
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,322
4 MONTHS LATER...

153
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:29,627
...are a resounding victory
for the Popular Front!

154
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,532
M\r. Léon Blum
is forming a government...

155
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,868
...to carry out
unprecedented social reforms...

156
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,203
...bound to create further tension.

157
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:40,707
M\ore than a turning point...

158
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,280
...it's a revolution for workers.

159
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,417
These are times of hope.

160
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,680
FOR SALE

161
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,251
Dad?

162
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,855
- What is it?
- Your breakfast.

163
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:35,495
- What time is it?
- Eight o'clock.

164
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,363
- You're not at school?
- I'm going.

165
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,470
Off you go.

166
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,099
Thanks.

167
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:58,113
Long live the Popular Front!

168
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,730
Come and see. It's heating up.

169
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:14,304
All comrades must stand united
for a common cause, the strike!

170
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:18,876
An immediate strike!
Here and now!

171
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:22,572
Easy to call for a strike
when you don't work here.

172
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,679
But I'll be here.

173
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,277
Every day...

174
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,420
...with the union to back you.

175
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:30,947
Who's for?

176
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,292
Well?

177
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,122
Who's for?

178
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:39,453
Yes.

179
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,962
Come on, vote.

180
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:48,470
- Strike!
- Yes, comrades!

181
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:49,938
A unanimous vote.

182
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:52,633
I need your help, Mr. Galapiat.

183
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,205
The union has sent Emile Leibovich.

184
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,917
I'm seeing red, literally.

185
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:00,240
What will you do?

186
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,580
Come on, let's go.

187
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:04,950
With two bottles of red...

188
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:08,093
...that makes
22 francs and 52 centimes.

189
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,989
Tell me, Crouzet.

190
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:11,925
I've known you a while now.

191
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,123
Why give only me credit?

192
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:17,100
I trust you, Pigoil.

193
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,669
- Jojo doesn't suspect anything?
- Nothing.

194
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,500
We've never had debts before.

195
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,805
Like I told you,
it's between you and me.

196
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,171
Have a good day, Crouzet.

197
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,715
- Here we go.
- Not too fast!

198
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,876
Let's get rich!

199
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:40,149
This kid Jojo is gonna go far

200
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:43,659
His fingers as swift as a shooting star

201
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,964
With a memory that nothing can mar

202
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:51,325
This kid Jojo is gonna go far

203
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:55,564
One day when he's a true champion

204
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:59,308
A leading brand of accordion

205
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:03,312
On its goods will carve his name

206
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:07,077
To ensure his everlasting fame

207
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,989
Thank you!
Jojo and Clément will be back...

208
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,216
...same time tomorrow.

209
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,194
You're a lousy singer.

210
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:20,230
Who cares? It makes them laugh.
Next spot.

211
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,764
We did well today.

212
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,402
Come and see.

213
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:41,083
When I was in the Red Army...

214
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,521
...I lost a lot of comrades in battle.

215
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,883
The strike suits you.

216
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:51,022
I'm Emile.

217
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,322
Milou to the ladies.

218
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,309
Are you Leibovich?

219
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:13,576
In person.

220
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,787
- To join up, fill out a form at the door.
- A comedian.

221
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:22,784
You commies have five minutes
to get out.

222
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:25,488
I smell Yid.

223
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,614
Come on, kids!

224
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:24,511
What's going on?

225
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,552
Don't just stand there! Run!

226
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:29,620
Fascists!

227
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,129
Bastards!

228
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,789
Fascist bastards!

229
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:42,006
Keep away from the laundry.

230
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,740
Strikes aren't for kids.

231
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,070
They're for idlers.

232
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,803
Milou's no idler.

233
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:51,344
Milou? He's the king of idle slobs.

234
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:57,480
The Chansonia closed four months
ago. Seen him work since?

235
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,213
I haven't.

236
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,318
He's always chasing skirt...

237
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,655
...stirring up trouble in factories...

238
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,526
...yelling about strikes
and occupations.

239
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,031
I can do that too.

240
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,328
You don't work either.

241
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,230
I wanted to ask you.

242
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,898
Why don't you and Milou
speak anymore?

243
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:21,175
Is it because of Mom?

244
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,869
Sort of.

245
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:24,771
Do you miss Mom?

246
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:27,841
Do you miss her?

247
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:32,353
No. Do you?

248
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:35,558
Me neither.

249
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:37,786
Liar.

250
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,057
Liar yourself.

251
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,493
Eat while it's hot.

252
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:55,975
Is it good?

253
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,219
You impressed us at the laundry.

254
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,655
You didn't waste time, old chap.

255
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,989
The one with the ball is pretty.

256
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,127
Too bad.

257
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:16,734
You certainly deserve
a role worthy of you.

258
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:20,099
- When?
- Once we take power.

259
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:24,503
Blum is already up the creek.
He'll fall like rotten fruit.

260
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,166
And we'll be waiting.

261
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:29,712
Heading the militia contingent
is a good start...

262
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,873
...but with the support I give you- -

263
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,110
150,000 francs since January.

264
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:39,555
- - I hope for other responsibilities
in your party, my dear Grevoul.

265
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,489
You'll have them.
But you must calm down.

266
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:46,119
"Soft pedal," as you people say.
Explain, Tortil.

267
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,026
Your boys overdid it at the laundry.

268
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:52,170
One worker, a father of four,
is in a coma.

269
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,335
I may not be able
to cover you next time.

270
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:58,070
Enough idle chat.

271
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:01,269
I hear you have
some new goods in stock.

272
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,472
- Top- quality.
- I'll vouch for that.

273
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:07,881
If the inspector vouches for it...
You spoil us, Galapiat.

274
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,750
- Let's see.
- Always ready to serve France.

275
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,292
Blimey, true as
my name's Fernandel...

276
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,894
...I remember
the conscription officer told me:.

277
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:23,501
"You're short of breath,
you need a bigger chest."

278
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:26,570
I told him,
"My sister got all the chest."

279
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,339
I've got him down pat, right?

280
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:33,010
I'll fit it into my act.

281
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,612
My one- man show,
as they say on Broadway.

282
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,806
They'll go wild.

283
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,747
How many auditions
these last four months?

284
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,648
Around 10.

285
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:44,749
Maybe a few more.

286
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:46,288
And always turned down?

287
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,585
You're so naive. Can't you see...

288
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,928
...established stars block the way?

289
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,926
Sure.

290
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:56,332
A guy like me puts them
in a blue funk.

291
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:57,799
Give it a rest.

292
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:00,129
You're wearing us out, Jacky.

293
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,900
Just find a job. A real one.
With real pay!

294
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,110
Thanks for helping Jojo.

295
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:16,849
Only natural.

296
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:20,523
It changes nothing.
I haven't forgotten about Viviane.

297
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,952
Have a drink and make up.

298
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:24,527
I don't drink with traitors.

299
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,659
I don't drink at all anymore.

300
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,341
What?

301
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:42,611
Lovely! Good payers
are hard to come by these days.

302
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,248
Just carry on like this.

303
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,010
Give him all he wants,
but he mustn't know.

304
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,876
You're a complicated lot.

305
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:52,579
Don't worry, it's between us. Here.

306
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,984
You're two francs over.

307
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,592
Here.

308
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:04,901
Where's this from?

309
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:07,037
It's a gift from Crouzet.

310
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:10,004
A gift? From Crouzet?

311
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,801
I swear.

312
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:14,878
Lying to me now.
We Pigoils never steal!

313
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,537
I didn't steal it.

314
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,115
Consider this a gift too!

315
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,924
Jojo, come back!

316
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,638
Here they come!

317
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:55,449
This kid Jojo is gonna go far

318
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:59,182
His fingers as swift as a shooting star

319
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:01,758
With a memory that nothing can mar

320
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,451
What are you up to?

321
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,221
How old are you?

322
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,657
He can't even play the accordion, sir.

323
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,303
I'd like to help, but...

324
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,299
All right.

325
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,338
Sit down, Mr. Pigoil.

326
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,447
Your son is engaged in begging.

327
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:26,106
You're no longer capable
of raising the boy.

328
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,378
He'd be better off in care?

329
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,282
Who mentioned care?

330
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:31,714
He has a mother.

331
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:36,188
His mother's gone on tour
with her lover boy.

332
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:39,194
She's back.
She admits she was wrong...

333
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:42,492
...and has been here
to tell us she wants her son back.

334
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:46,263
I have agreed to that,
for a trial period.

335
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:49,502
Seriously?

336
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:52,175
Until you've found
regular employment...

337
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:56,474
...you won't be able to have him back,
or even see him.

338
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:00,140
But she walked out on us!
Months without a word!

339
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,883
Your ex- wife is now involved in...

340
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:06,218
...a model relationship with a retailer.

341
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:07,983
A retailer?

342
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,593
A spirits merchant.

343
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:12,696
Calm and honest.
In a small country town.

344
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,200
Ideal for your son.

345
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,315
Pigoil?

346
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,281
We forgot to give him this.

347
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:41,187
Chin up.

348
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:52,162
The Great MAX

349
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:55,664
- Yes?
- Open up.

350
00:22:58,677 --> 00:22:59,803
Recognize this?

351
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:02,410
Come here, bastard!

352
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:04,445
Stop! I don't want to go out!

353
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:08,575
You taught him to beg!
That was his homework. Why?

354
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:09,743
Down, Aristide!

355
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:17,257
"The sea, the sea."
It's all you talk about.

356
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:18,820
Talked about.

357
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,089
He wanted to make enough
to take you.

358
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,499
Why didn't you tell me?

359
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,636
It was a surprise.

360
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,772
And I never see you anyway.

361
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:31,471
Of course, you haven't been out
for 20 years now.

362
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:33,967
Thanks to my radio...

363
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,512
...I know the world as if I did go out.

364
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:45,688
You're not missing much.

365
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,783
Look what the world's made of me.

366
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:18,813
What's going on?
Who opened the place up?

367
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,925
Jacky. He's lost his mind. Look.

368
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,390
He's told everyone to come.

369
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:26,557
Galapiat will be hopping mad.

370
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,228
It looks good.

371
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:36,972
Well? Can't you guess?

372
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:41,236
Make an effort.
I'm sure you know this voice.

373
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,907
What on earth is this masquerade?

374
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:46,847
Order, gentlemen! I want order!

375
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:48,882
So? Who is it?

376
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,078
Hitler?

377
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:53,417
Inspector Tortil!

378
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:54,820
Get out of here!

379
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,054
Who goes there?

380
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,553
This looks bad.

381
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:00,822
Get down, idiot.

382
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:03,193
Get out! It's private property!

383
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:04,561
Out with you.

384
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:07,034
Don't you speak French, you clown?

385
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,673
Ever heard of manners?

386
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,673
You say hello when you turn up.

387
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:14,937
You shouldn't be here.

388
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,813
Wait till Mr. Galapiat finds out.

389
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,712
I'm scared.

390
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:23,278
We can still have a laugh here.

391
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:26,216
Your Chansonia's dead, moron!

392
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:32,020
Not yet!

393
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,097
This is our place.

394
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:35,790
We've given it our lives.

395
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:38,868
We'll take something back now.

396
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,104
We're occupying it.

397
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,299
- What?
- We're occupying it!

398
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:46,603
Yeah, we're occupying.

399
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,539
What's up, guys?

400
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,776
You can't improvise a revolution.

401
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:59,617
I don't care about your revolution.
I just want a steady job.

402
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:09,628
Chansonia occupied.

403
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,633
You said it.

404
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,003
Just a second.

405
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:20,838
You think you can restore everything...

406
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:24,448
...set up a new show,
run a business.

407
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,584
All that...

408
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:29,286
- ...in my place?
- Well, yes.

409
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:31,547
We're professionals.

410
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,747
I admire your passion for work...

411
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:37,190
...but private property
is a sacred right in France.

412
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:42,157
We'll pay rent. With luck,
we'll buy the place one day.

413
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:45,935
How? By singing for your supper?

414
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,202
In any case...

415
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:53,337
...you have no choice.

416
00:26:57,382 --> 00:27:01,341
Tomorrow, the whole country
will be on strike.

417
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,282
The times are changing.

418
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:04,814
Stop it, please.

419
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,720
Enough, Pigoil.
I'm sick of their smooth talk.

420
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:11,286
The workers are taking back
their work tool.

421
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:15,060
Bravo, Comrade Leibovich.

422
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:19,731
A true democrat. With men like you,
France is in good hands.

423
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:24,705
You leave France be.
She doesn't need schemers like you.

424
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:27,307
What are you implying?

425
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:31,614
Can I have a word with you? Alone.

426
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:33,816
What is it?

427
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:37,044
- You remember Charles Vl?
- What?

428
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:39,247
Charles Vl, son of Charles V...

429
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:41,415
...whom he succeeded in 1380.

430
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:44,824
Enough, Triquet.
Watch your tone with me.

431
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:49,023
His peaceful nature
endeared him to the French.

432
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,567
They called him
"Charles the Beloved."

433
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,500
What the hell do I care?

434
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,937
You heard Tortil.

435
00:27:57,108 --> 00:28:00,407
If you're harsh,
you may lose everything.

436
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:04,070
Stay discreet, show trust.

437
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:06,080
You already rule the Faubourg.

438
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:09,220
Become its Beloved.

439
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:12,522
Galapiat the Beloved.

440
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:26,833
- Morning.
- Hi, Pigoil.

441
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,907
Veal stew "Chansonia"

442
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:44,519
So you're with us, are you?

443
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:47,487
Isn't it obvious? You fatheads.

444
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,144
Guys.

445
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:20,719
Galapiat gave us a month.

446
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:22,593
A month to succeed, Jojo.

447
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,959
The Chansonia is in a bad way.

448
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,725
We'd never have managed it all
on our own.

449
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,992
Nearly there.

450
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:31,157
Time to eat!

451
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:35,067
They're all back, happy to work,
even for nothing...

452
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,208
... until the first receipts.

453
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:41,003
Even your pal Clément came.
I think he misses you.

454
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,647
Careful, lads. I get vertigo.

455
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,077
So don't look at us.

456
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:05,091
You play the accordion.

457
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:09,702
I hope you'll play me
a tune or two soon.

458
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,899
I miss you so much.

459
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:14,772
Lots of love. Dad.

460
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,620
I'm not accusing anyone.

461
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:32,820
I'm just saying this mill worked well.

462
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:35,724
So buy a new one.

463
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,993
It's only 15 years old.

464
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:44,073
Mom, can you post this for me?

465
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:05,088
We have to go every day.

466
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:07,424
They have to see it's my place.

467
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,328
They mustn't forget that.

468
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,469
That's why monarchs
put their heads on coins.

469
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:13,626
Enough!

470
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:14,829
- Philippe le- -
- Enough!

471
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:16,303
- Stop!
- Philippe le Bel.

472
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:18,635
Excuse me.

473
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:25,149
I'd like to see Mr. Dorfeuil.

474
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:30,815
That's terrible.

475
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:32,013
He was desperate.

476
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:35,682
He begged me to buy his theater.
I didn't quibble.

477
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,351
Friendship is priceless.

478
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:41,788
But fine gestures
aren't always enough.

479
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:46,034
Why did you want to see
dear old Dorfeuil?

480
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:49,530
He was the last person
Mother knew in Paris.

481
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:51,641
Knew? Why? Is she...?

482
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:54,471
She's dead. Two months ago.

483
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:56,371
You poor dear.

484
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,914
- I'm not your poor dear.
- Just a way of speaking.

485
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:03,153
I see you with your little suitcase...

486
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:06,449
...your little dress,
your little tears.

487
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:08,385
You're very sentimental.

488
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,756
Not always.

489
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:17,194
There's your pretty smile.

490
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:20,636
- I have to go.
- What? So soon?

491
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:22,796
I'll make the rounds...

492
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,006
...and do auditions.

493
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:26,666
Auditions?

494
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:29,369
- I want to make my debut.
- Debut in what?

495
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:31,071
The music hall, of course.

496
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:35,185
Well, I never... It's not easy.
You need contacts.

497
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:37,553
I'm not scared.

498
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,550
Thank you for your welcome.

499
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:46,220
- Mr. Galapiat told me to help you.
- I'm all right.

500
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:47,864
Mondain.

501
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:50,523
My chauffeur.
He'll take you where you like.

502
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:53,000
Mr. Triquet, my accountant.
Mademoiselle.

503
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:54,229
Douce.

504
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:55,997
That's sweet, "Douce."

505
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:58,938
Do you have family here?
Where will you sleep?

506
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,238
I'll manage.
I've got my wits about me.

507
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:04,881
- Do we have a room left?
- I'll check.

508
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:07,415
- I'm all right, really.
- Allow me to insist.

509
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:09,052
In memory of Dorfeuil.

510
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:13,623
You'll be safe with me.
I'm Félix Galapiat, real- estate agent.

511
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:17,318
I do business too.
Do you know what they call me?

512
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:20,521
The Beloved. Galapiat the Beloved.

513
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:22,333
Allow me to show you why.

514
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,759
Pigoil, we're sick of it.

515
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:27,629
You say we're all in this together...

516
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:31,297
...then you hire sluts
once our backs are turned.

517
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,137
You see evil everywhere.

518
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:35,609
What else are Galapiat's floozies?

519
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,907
What choice do we have?

520
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,775
Let's start.

521
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:43,583
- What are those for?
- To look cold.

522
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:45,382
You don't show what you think.

523
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:47,547
You look like a fly.

524
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:49,852
I can't see either.

525
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:23,154
You're hired.

526
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:25,818
- You'll be paid from the takings.
- What?

527
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:27,856
It said so in the ad.

528
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:31,263
- You'll only be paid if it's a hit.
- What?

529
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,128
Gentlemen...

530
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,438
...I'm leaving.

531
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:38,439
Goodbye. Next!

532
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,336
Blaise? Why are you here?

533
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:44,378
I'm out of work too.

534
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:47,040
- We can't pay you at first.
- Do I get meals?

535
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,452
- Yes.
- Beverages too?

536
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:51,746
- Yes.
- Count me in.

537
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:54,113
Next!

538
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:00,691
Love me

539
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:03,993
It's what you do best

540
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:06,930
Honestly!

541
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:09,235
Don't you have another pianist?

542
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:12,599
Cut it out.

543
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:18,276
He's good.

544
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:22,842
Be careful what you eat
Not too salty nor too sweet

545
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,544
You only have one stomach

546
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:28,584
Be careful what you drink
Not too fizzy

547
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:31,258
Nor too still
Or you'll need to pee

548
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:35,826
M\y belly aches

549
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:38,997
Too late, it's time to go

550
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,836
Bravo!

551
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:46,702
- He's hired.
- Yes, he's good.

552
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:47,867
Next!

553
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:50,980
It's the girl Mr. Galapiat sent.

554
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:54,116
- Here we go.
- What can this tart do?

555
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:55,582
Who knows?

556
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:57,584
Back to the knocking shop with her.

557
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:00,788
Hello, young lady.

558
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:03,220
- What's your name?
- Douce.

559
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:06,056
- I'm sorry?
- Douce.

560
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:08,391
What can you show us?

561
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,158
Her tits.

562
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:14,131
Whatever you like.
I can sing a song.

563
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:15,294
No, thank you.

564
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:17,065
We have singers for that.

565
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:18,868
Stick to what you do best.

566
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:23,241
I can recite a commercial, then.
A radio commercial.

567
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:24,904
Keep on wasting your time.

568
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:26,777
Milou.

569
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:30,253
Recite your commercial.

570
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:32,783
Be it by the fire at home...

571
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,920
...or for a night on the town...

572
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:37,151
...for my sweet lover alone...

573
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:39,296
...or for a crowd in my gown...

574
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,929
...I use Simon cream
to make me attractive and pretty.

575
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:45,297
Like every girl in the city.

576
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:50,240
I thank Simon cream

577
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,735
Simon cream

578
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:56,143
Announcer?

579
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:58,742
We'll have to see her pins.

580
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:00,746
Right.

581
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:04,078
May we see your legs?

582
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:19,537
- Not bad.
- You're hired.

583
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,069
The Chansonia is looking so fine

584
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,975
Because Faubourg Paints
Has colors divine

585
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:33,048
Good. The second one.

586
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:37,750
Jeanne and her hair styles

587
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,686
Are the best anywhere for miles

588
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:42,758
It's good thanking our partners.

589
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,760
- Sure.
- It's true.

590
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,625
He's in his Sunday best!

591
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,790
How's the ventriloquist doing?

592
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:52,435
Ace, like your suit.

593
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,503
Pigoil, isn't it time to eat?

594
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:56,162
That's all you think of.

595
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,604
- Your musicians?
- They're free.

596
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,710
- Are they good?
- They're free.

597
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:01,970
My costumes?

598
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:04,546
See Milou about that. Milou!

599
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:05,773
Pigoil!

600
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:08,645
Very funny.
Take her to Paris- Costumes.

601
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:10,218
Send the artistic director.

602
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:11,685
I have to rehearse.

603
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:13,653
Ask about my new jacket.

604
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:16,054
You handle the money, so see to it.

605
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:18,821
I have a reputation here.

606
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,121
- You go.
- I can't.

607
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,665
- Got a cocktail party?
- An appointment.

608
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,768
A romantic one.

609
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:30,473
You understand what I'm after?

610
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,132
Songs about walks in the park.

611
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,744
Merry and joyful ones.

612
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:38,176
Manager of what, exactly?

613
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:41,546
The Chansonia. I've taken it over,
with my partners.

614
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:45,177
Allow me to offer you
two free invitations.

615
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:48,152
Come anytime with your wife.

616
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:52,624
- Are you getting paid?
- Yes.

617
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:55,129
Well, no. But I soon will be.

618
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:57,199
So come back and see me soon.

619
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:59,131
I've stopped drinking.

620
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:01,396
Sorry, I have a lot of work.

621
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:04,541
I know Mr. Galapiat very well too.

622
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:09,270
Is that a threat?

623
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:11,742
You're barking up the wrong tree.

624
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,942
No, I didn't mean anything by that.

625
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:22,391
This is for my son.

626
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,929
Since I can't have his address,
can you forward it to him?

627
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,895
I'll see what I can do.

628
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:30,761
Thank you.

629
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,206
Look at this one.

630
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,107
All silk with sequins.

631
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,774
Look at the finish.

632
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,580
How much?

633
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,615
Two thousand a week.

634
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:49,809
You think we're suckers?

635
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:54,151
Don't move, I'll be right back.

636
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:58,118
Shopping with you is a joy.

637
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:00,126
We're not the Folies Bergère.

638
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:02,563
- It's the union's money.
- Spoilsport.

639
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:10,833
Well?

640
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,168
Common.

641
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:13,810
Nouveau riche. No good.

642
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:20,006
I know why you're so mean to me.

643
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:24,750
You're attracted to me.

644
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:29,322
I'm attracted?

645
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:33,687
And you can't bear the idea of it.

646
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,354
Here we are.

647
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,364
Twelve hundred. Will that do?

648
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:38,968
It's the cheapest I have.

649
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:43,472
Why don't you ask your protector...

650
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,140
...to dress you at Lanvin?

651
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:46,708
He's not my protector.

652
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:49,505
All right. I can be more vulgar.

653
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,175
Well...

654
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:59,322
...this show has to be worth seeing.

655
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,720
What's your problem?

656
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:11,500
Beware of reds.
You're heading for a fall.

657
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:14,571
- Reds?
- Yes, reds.

658
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:16,728
For instance...

659
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:18,875
...the one you were with today...

660
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:20,707
...is a real red.

661
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:23,813
An agitator ready to sell France
to Moscow.

662
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:26,676
And to abuse young orphan girls.

663
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:29,247
- Are you jealous?
- Absolutely.

664
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,384
I have a right to be.

665
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,848
I watch over you. I worry.

666
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:38,188
That's very kind. Thank you.

667
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:40,354
But I never asked you to.

668
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:43,090
You make me suffer, Douce.

669
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:46,898
You're so distant. It hurts.

670
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:48,627
Where?

671
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:51,740
Here.

672
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:55,301
There.

673
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:06,212
Let me help you reach the very top
as you deserve.

674
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,368
Good night.

675
00:42:29,513 --> 00:42:31,037
Take me home.

676
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:54,929
- I'm in bed!
- It's Emile.

677
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:14,683
- Good evening.
- I could have been with a client.

678
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:18,492
Sorry about earlier.

679
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:21,958
It's not like me to...
I know you're not a...

680
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:24,663
I apologize, okay.

681
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:26,598
Come on in.

682
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,930
No, I don't want...

683
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,333
Don't be afraid.

684
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:32,270
I'm not afraid.

685
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:49,316
I didn't pick the decor.

686
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:51,686
Glad to hear it.

687
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:58,463
- Where did he take you?
- Who?

688
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:03,632
To his cabaret, the Arabian Nights.
You know it?

689
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:05,475
No.

690
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:07,335
I don't go to rich folks' clubs.

691
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,845
So where do you go?

692
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:13,312
Shindigs, dance halls,
places where workers go.

693
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,384
That's where I come from.

694
00:44:15,552 --> 00:44:18,385
I'm from Lille. Well, near there.

695
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:20,579
I didn't know.

696
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:24,155
What do you know about me?

697
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:27,390
That you're pretty.

698
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:30,832
And Galapiat's friend.

699
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:34,770
- Not again.
- I know how to flush out the enemy.

700
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:37,406
I was in the Red Army elite corps.

701
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:40,537
Real tough guys,
nothing like Galapiat.

702
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:43,605
Watch your step with him.
He's scum.

703
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:46,512
Funny, he said the same about you.

704
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:48,709
He did?

705
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:50,512
Who'll you believe?

706
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:53,352
I don't know.

707
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:55,754
I'll think about it.

708
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:18,140
And now, Monsieur Fernandel.

709
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:19,905
Maestro.

710
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:24,654
I don't know, I don't know

711
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:27,120
I don't know if Raymonde is blonde

712
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:29,690
Under her arms, left and right

713
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,828
The hair is black as night

714
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:34,830
On the day we finally wed

715
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:37,125
After the party, we were in bed

716
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:39,326
I had a revelation

717
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:42,533
She wasn't blonde
What deception

718
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:49,445
Bravo! Excellent, Jacky!

719
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:53,279
Thank you. Come back anytime!

720
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:55,246
Thank you.

721
00:45:57,955 --> 00:45:59,445
Sorry.

722
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:05,261
Magnificent.

723
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:07,487
It's not quite ready.

724
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:10,531
Have you seen
my young protégée anywhere?

725
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:14,034
She's gone. To try on costumes.
Something sexy.

726
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:15,535
You see what I mean?

727
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:18,231
- Not alone?
- No, with Milou. Emile.

728
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:21,104
He knows all about skimpy dresses.

729
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:24,177
Can I buy you a drink?

730
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:27,813
Frankly, I'm worried
about the Chansonia.

731
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:30,852
Apart from you and Douce,
the others...

732
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:32,989
You've noticed then?

733
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,180
No, no.

734
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:36,917
Thank you.

735
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:39,729
I'll tell you something.

736
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:43,355
I'm what they call a star turn.

737
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:45,434
Precisely.

738
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:48,537
I'll offer you a deal.

739
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:50,536
Fill me in on everything...

740
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:53,473
...the problems, who's doing what.

741
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:56,736
Be my right- hand man, in short.

742
00:46:57,047 --> 00:47:00,073
And I'll help you with your career.

743
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,514
- How?
- A big stage.

744
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:04,320
Just for you.

745
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:13,028
Can I really say stuff like this?

746
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:16,462
It's humor, Jacky, a caricature.

747
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:19,932
Your talent will make it work,
believe me.

748
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,465
Our old Gallo- Roman homeland...

749
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:25,369
...now governed
by a naturalized Jew.

750
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:27,601
Since all of us here in SOC...

751
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:29,370
...Iove our dear France...

752
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:32,777
...it is our duty to raise a wall...

753
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:36,909
...a patriotic rampart
to keep out all the rats...

754
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:41,784
...who come to eat
our fine French cheeses!

755
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:43,923
Long live France!

756
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:46,387
Long live SOC!

757
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:14,954
Do you recognize me?

758
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,718
Try hard.

759
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:22,628
They call me the Yid.

760
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:24,560
"Kike" to my friends.

761
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:32,533
Fear not, I don't mean you any harm.

762
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:34,506
I love France!

763
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:37,978
As long as she fills my pockets.

764
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:45,878
Seen my carpet, my friend?

765
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:48,290
Nice and cheap.

766
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:50,619
Cheaper than Léon Blum!

767
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,354
What do you think of it?

768
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:55,395
Remarkable.

769
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:58,363
I wrote it.

770
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:01,464
Yeah, boss!

771
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:04,636
No problem, boss!

772
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:08,005
We go out picking that cotton!

773
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:12,778
Charge, sergeant!

774
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:22,757
I hear it's an excellent film.

775
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:27,890
Paris. In these troubled times
of strikes and factory occupations...

776
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:31,501
...the unemployed
of a neighborhood have united...

777
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:33,363
... to revive a music hall...

778
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:36,563
... with imagination
and staunch determination.

779
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:40,403
Stagehands, cashiers, usherettes
and even sandwich men...

780
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:42,677
...all jobs that need filling.

781
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:46,373
All the local businesses
support them...

782
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:49,951
...from the café owner to the grocer
while waiting for the artists.

783
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,611
It's good to see
the French stand united.

784
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:54,086
An example to follow!

785
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:57,185
A fine example.

786
00:49:58,929 --> 00:49:59,987
Where are you going?

787
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,427
Jojo, come back!

788
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:07,130
Hold my bag.

789
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:09,864
- Where are you going?
- I'll be right back.

790
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:23,646
You think I feel nothing?

791
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:29,816
I've made blunders.

792
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:32,359
But I came back for you.

793
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:35,787
I'm doing all this for you.

794
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:39,828
You've made a lot of progress here.

795
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:43,700
Don't worry about your dad.
He has all he needs.

796
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:47,671
Come back in now.
I got us the best seats.

797
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:51,177
All right, we're coming.

798
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:02,884
You're my sweetheart.

799
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:07,326
The Chansonia reopens tonight!
Free admission for all!

800
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:09,488
See the Five- Man Quartet!

801
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:13,796
Romance with Roger Nizza!
The escape artist, Fred Kraft!

802
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:17,906
And only at the Chansonia,
the Prince of lmitators, Jacky Jacquet!

803
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:28,977
- Where were you?
- I forgot the time.

804
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:31,586
Are you kidding? He forgot the time.

805
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:35,152
Everyone's here.

806
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:39,318
Not only. Look at the third row.

807
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:41,963
The cream of the press is here.

808
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:43,759
Even the radio has come.

809
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:47,297
- Here we go. Mazel tov!
- Don't screw up.

810
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:48,836
Showtime!

811
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:53,474
Good evening.
Welcome to the Chansonia.

812
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:56,305
It's an important evening
for our music hall...

813
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,469
Break a leg!

814
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:58,978
...run by Mr. Pigoil.

815
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:00,673
Over to you.

816
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:02,409
Show them what we're made of.

817
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:05,680
Remember what I said, keep smiling.

818
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:07,886
Your paper!

819
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:12,457
Ready?

820
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:14,965
Here we go.

821
00:52:34,951 --> 00:52:35,940
Go on.

822
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:40,222
Good evening
and welcome to the Chansonia...

823
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:42,782
...for its gala reopening.

824
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:46,258
This is a big night for our music hall...

825
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:48,420
...now run by Mr. Pigoil...

826
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:54,264
...and his friends.

827
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:56,132
Strip!

828
00:52:57,941 --> 00:52:58,999
Only after you do.

829
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:08,679
We wouldn't be here
without everyone who believed in us.

830
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:13,951
For fresh produce every day
One address, chez Crouzet

831
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:20,256
For his cooking and fine wine

832
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:23,058
Take a table at Célestin's

833
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:30,365
And thank you to Mr. Galapiat
who made this possible.

834
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,242
No need to overdo it.

835
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:34,434
And now...

836
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:37,478
...the man known
as "The Prince of lmitators."

837
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:40,109
Yes, the one and only...

838
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:41,750
...Jacky Jacquet!

839
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:48,780
Perfect!

840
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:50,927
- Really?
- lf the manager says so...

841
00:53:51,094 --> 00:53:53,460
Get the next announcement ready.

842
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:55,962
Jacky, we're right behind you.

843
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:10,010
Bravo, Jacky!

844
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:17,818
Thank you.

845
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:21,521
Thanks to Jacky,
the Prince of lmitators...

846
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:23,181
...we're taking flight.

847
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:26,261
Here come the planes.

848
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:44,377
You can picture the plane.
He's priceless.

849
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:51,778
Thank you.

850
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:54,513
Now let's go fishing.

851
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:57,660
It's a sunny day.
Look up. What do I see there?

852
00:54:57,827 --> 00:55:01,319
Ducks!
Ducks, ladies and gentlemen.

853
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:05,396
Do you see them?

854
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:06,694
The daddy duck.

855
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:07,859
The mommy duck.

856
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:09,538
The ducklings.

857
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:13,399
Ducks, ladies and gentlemen.

858
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:21,606
We can't leave this fabulous place...

859
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:23,514
...without hearing the frogs wake.

860
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:25,382
Here come the frogs.

861
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:41,335
It takes some doing.
He's alone up there.

862
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:43,902
It's not easy.

863
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:47,565
- He's not funny.
- Try doing the frog for this crowd.

864
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:49,268
Thank you.

865
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:51,202
Bravo!

866
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,752
They're a bit cold tonight.

867
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:02,118
I'll warm them up.

868
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:08,292
You've been waiting for him.

869
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:11,093
With special permission
from his sergeant- -

870
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:12,393
A song!

871
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:13,593
Yeah, a song!

872
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:17,930
- - our greatest comic troupers.
You know who I mean, Poupart!

873
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:21,142
A song!

874
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:24,780
- What's wrong?
- She has to sing.

875
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:28,977
- You have to sing.
- What?

876
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:31,245
They want a song.
You must know one.

877
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:32,479
No.

878
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:34,646
- Not very well.
- lt'll do.

879
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:36,416
- What about me?
- Later.

880
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:38,458
Go on.

881
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:53,306
It won't work.

882
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:01,778
Whenever I'm far from Paris

883
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:05,546
M\y lungs can't catch a breath

884
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:09,556
M\y heart is filled with tears

885
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:13,423
And my body feels exiled

886
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,120
The furthest

887
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:17,289
I ever went was along the M\arne

888
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:21,096
To follow a little crush I had

889
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:24,968
But as soon as all the din fades

890
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:28,133
I'm bored for silence doesn't suit me

891
00:57:28,645 --> 00:57:31,273
Paris, Paris

892
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:35,746
You're my only family

893
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:39,513
Paris, Paris

894
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:43,785
Only with you is my heart free

895
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:49,462
If I don't see you again tomorrow

896
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:52,934
Paris, I'll die

897
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:56,838
Eaten up by sorrow

898
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:10,013
You bewitch me with your charms

899
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:17,851
I'll lie naked in your arms

900
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:23,499
If I don't see you again tomorrow

901
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:27,261
Paris, I'll die

902
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:34,868
Eaten up by sorrow

903
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:01,959
You realize?
