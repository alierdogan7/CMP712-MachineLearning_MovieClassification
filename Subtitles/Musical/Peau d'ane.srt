00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,014
DONKEY SKIN

2
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,688
From Charles Perrault´s fairytale

3
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,494
<i>Once upon a time</i>
<i>there was a great King,</i>

4
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,215
<i>so loved by his people</i>
<i>and respected by others</i>

5
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,730
<i>that he was the happiest of monarchs.</i>

6
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,896
<i>Happy too</i>

7
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,013
<i>in the choice of his beautiful</i>
<i>and virtuous wife.</i>

8
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,657
<i>The couple lived in perfect harmony.</i>

9
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,336
<i>They had a daughter</i>
<i>of such grace and charm</i>

10
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,737
<i>that they never regretted</i>
<i>having but one child.</i>

11
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,619
<i>Their palace was a marvel</i>
<i>of taste and abundance.</i>

12
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,175
<i>The buildings were magnificent.</i>

13
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,049
<i>The vast stables were filled</i>
<i>with handsome steeds.</i>

14
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,339
<i>But what most surprised visitors</i>

15
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,170
<i>was a donkey</i>
<i>in the most prominent place.</i>

16
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,970
<i>This iniquity may surprise you</i>

17
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,614
<i>but when you learn</i>
<i>of his rare ability,</i>

18
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,618
<i>you will agree</i>
<i>that this honor was his due.</i>

19
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,537
<i>However, the vicissitudes of life</i>
<i>fall also on kings,</i>

20
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,176
<i>and the greatest good</i>
<i>is always mixed with bad.</i>

21
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,978
<i>The Queen was stricken</i>
<i>by a cruel malady,</i>

22
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,378
<i>and neither the doctors</i>
<i>who studied Greek</i>

23
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,050
<i>nor the quacks in vogue</i>
<i>could do aught for her.</i>

24
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,013
Allow me, before I die,
to make one request.

25
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,532
If you should wish to remarry...

26
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,258
Never, dearest Queen!

27
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,338
I should rather follow you.

28
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,773
I believe you.

29
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,291
But the State requires heirs.

30
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,456
I gave you only a daughter.

31
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,220
Your advisors
will want you to have a son.

32
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,092
Hush!

33
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,692
Listen...

34
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,858
Swear by your love for me

35
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,813
to marry again
only when you have found

36
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,569
a woman more beautiful than I.

37
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,458
Impossible!

38
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,289
Swear it
so that I may die content.

39
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,497
I swear it.

40
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,252
The Queen is dead.

41
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,052
Come, father.

42
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,015
Leave me, child.

43
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,574
I never wish to see you again.

44
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,572
Ministøi!

45
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,052
Speak.

46
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,971
We think that it is bad for you
- and for the State - to remain alone.

47
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,173
Solitude is unhealthy for kings.
It is time you remarried.

48
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,814
Why do you always request
the impossible?

49
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,659
The State needs a male heir.

50
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,250
The kingdom is at peace
and does not desire war.

51
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,691
Your advisors can but approve
of your policy

52
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,449
but we <i>are</i> supposed to advise you.

53
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,652
I understand your reasons.
I can remarry

54
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,137
but I swore to the Queen
to wed only a princess

55
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,133
more beautiful than she.

56
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,730
- A vain promise!
- How so?

57
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,455
Her beauty matters little
if she is prolific and good.

58
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,890
I do not agree with you

59
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,814
and I will not break my promise.

60
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,853
Search for a princess
who might suit me

61
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,529
in the neighboring kingdoms.

62
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,849
I wish but to please.

63
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,492
The Prime Minister!

64
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,930
That means trouble.

65
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,971
I beg your pardon, Your Majesty.

66
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,695
Well?

67
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,255
Two of our messengers
have brought us

68
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,416
some charming portraits.

69
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,215
If they are like the others,
keep them.

70
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,615
Those were so bad,
you couldn´t tell

71
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,618
whether the girl
was pretty or stupid.

72
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,129
Let me see.

73
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,412
Her father has the largest kingdom...

74
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,009
Come now... Let me see!

75
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,858
She is hideous!

76
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,212
Her father would give you
half his land...

77
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,694
Let him keep it all!

78
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,334
I won´t have an ugly woman
on my arm!

79
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,014
This one is not so young but...

80
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,296
her fortune is greater by far...

81
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,656
than the number of her years.

82
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,778
Sadness!

83
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,179
Boredom!

84
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,059
Pride!

85
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,899
Hypocrisy!

86
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,534
They are all one-eyed or hunchbacks!

87
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,617
And probably deaf!

88
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,929
The fairytale princesses...

89
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,256
have they all disappeared?

90
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,052
There is this one.

91
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,614
Let me see.

92
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,454
God, how lovely she is!

93
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,494
You were hiding her, traitor.

94
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,576
How sweet she is! How pure!

95
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,857
How graceful!

96
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,620
Just look at that shoulder!

97
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,532
Who s she?

98
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,415
Your daughter, Sire.

99
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,136
<i>Love is worn around the neck.</i>

100
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,213
<i>Love is mad.</i>

101
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,095
<i>Four arms entwined...</i>

102
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,809
<i>The soul is glad.</i>

103
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,251
<i>Like a scarf of white woos woven,</i>

104
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,453
<i>love forms a knot.</i>

105
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,738
<i>Love, love</i>

106
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,853
<i>has made me mad.</i>

107
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,528
<i>Love often makes a clamor.</i>

108
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,249
<i>In youth</i>

109
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,616
<i>it cries, it stings,</i>

110
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,893
<i>it swears false oaths.</i>

111
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,376
<i>It makes those lovers suffer</i>

112
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,732
<i>Who refused to turn the page.</i>

113
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,694
<i>Love, love</i>

114
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,377
<i>is never wise.</i>

115
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,531
How beautiful she is!

116
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,050
More than the Queen, Sire...

117
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,172
And much more charming
and intelligent.

118
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,090
<i>When it has lived too long,</i>

119
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,894
<i>content,</i>

120
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,173
<i>Love, at the slightest snag,</i>

121
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,576
<i>frays,</i>

122
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,897
<i>caught on the nail of memory.</i>

123
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,252
<i>Love dies in time.</i>

124
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,418
<i>Love, love,</i>

125
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,418
<i>I love you so!</i>

126
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,857
<i>Love, love,</i>

127
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:26,329
<i>I love you so!</i>

128
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,253
Your father, the King,
has sent for you.

129
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,579
<i>Love, love, I love you so!</i>

130
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,933
You sent for me, father?

131
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,971
Does that surprise you?

132
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,650
Since my mother is death,
you have avoided me.

133
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,737
Were you hurt?

134
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,249
- Yes, father.
- I am sorry.

135
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,056
Solitude was my sole companion.

136
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,057
I have decided to change.

137
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,490
Stand, dear daughter.

138
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,177
I was listening to you.

139
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,213
Your singing enchanted me.

140
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,812
If you like music,

141
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,655
perhaps you do not dislike poetry.

142
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,377
I know little poetry,
but I like it.

143
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,696
I have some poems of the future.

144
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,334
The ancients wrote well...

145
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,540
but the poets of tomorrow

146
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,254
may delight you more.

147
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,258
<i>Listening to your fairy lute,</i>

148
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,811
<i>trees, stones follow you, Orpheus,</i>

149
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,295
<i>letting you shape them</i>
<i>as you choose.</i>

150
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,331
<i>Clio, the barmaid...</i>

151
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,458
<i>Calliope phoning in a scoop...</i>

152
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,334
<i>Urania turning on the gas lights</i>

153
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,452
<i>which paint the trees from below.</i>

154
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,657
Do you like it?

155
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,848
It is disconcerting.

156
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,456
Your godmother,
the lilac fairy, gave it to me.

157
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,777
Her knowledge
of the future amazes me.

158
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,690
Listen to another
which suits you well.

159
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,972
<i>The ring is slipped on the finger</i>

160
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,614
<i>after the sealing kiss.</i>

161
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,857
<i>What our lips are murmuring</i>

162
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,574
<i>is in the ring on the finger.</i>

163
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,658
<i>Weave roses through your hair.</i>

164
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,451
I love you and want to marry you.

165
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,418
Poetry deranges you, father.

166
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,929
I beg you to stop.

167
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,370
- Do you love me?
- Yes, a lot.

168
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,855
A lot is not enough.

169
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:53,412
Allow me to go, father.
I feel weary and troubled.

170
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,215
Be that as it may,
I have decided to marry you

171
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,138
and marry you I will.

172
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,173
Don´t ask me for such a crime.
Let me think.

173
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,371
Until tomorrow.

174
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,251
Ty jsi moudrý.

175
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,171
Your advice has never ed me astray.

176
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,169
I love the Princess
and I wish to marry her.

177
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,689
Is mine a sinful love?

178
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,489
Is she fond of your Majesty?

179
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,168
She says she loves me... a lot.

180
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,610
Yet she is confused.

181
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,731
Do you see what I mean?

182
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:02,369
The Princess is too young
to analyze her feelings.

183
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,453
It is written here

184
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,697
that all little girls who are asked:

185
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,778
"Whom will you wed
when you grow up?"

186
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,655
reply: "I want to marry Daddy."

187
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,691
Have you a daughter?

188
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,056
No, unfortunately.

189
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,338
but if I did,

190
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,817
I should certainly marry her.

191
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,580
You are the wisest of the wise.

192
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,688
I shall marry the Princess.

193
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,129
You! So early!

194
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,808
I hate to be taken unawares.

195
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,171
Excuse me, godmother,
but I have to tell you...

196
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,612
Don´t cry, child.

197
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,617
It will make you ugly.

198
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,219
But it´s dreadful!

199
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,297
Sit down.

200
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,778
Don´t tell me.
I know all about it.

201
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,290
Let me finish dressing.
And dry your tears.

202
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,690
You, go outside and play.

203
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,778
Yellow isn´t becoming to me.

204
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,412
That´s better.

205
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,537
My child, it would be sinful
to marry your father.

206
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,095
You must discourage him.

207
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,938
But I love him.

208
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,456
I know...

209
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,290
But you´re mixing up
different kinds of love.

210
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,491
I must give him an answer tomorrow.

211
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:16,412
<i>The situation requires attention.</i>

212
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:21,417
<i>Children do not marry</i>
<i>their parents, my child.</i>

213
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,259
<i>You love your father,</i>
<i>or so I gather.</i>

214
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:29,211
<i>But whatever their reasons</i>
<i>or feelings may be,</i>

215
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,250
<i>boys do not marry their mothers,</i>
<i>my child.</i>

216
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,497
<i>And it is the tradition</i>

217
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,418
<i>in every condition</i>

218
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,418
<i>for lawmakers to decree</i>

219
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:48,372
<i>that girls</i>
<i>do not marry their daddies.</i>

220
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:53,570
<i>A prince with a shepherdess</i>
<i>may find joy.</i>

221
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,897
<i>But a gils with her father</i>

222
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,776
<i>can expect nothing</i>
<i>but tainted offspring.</i>

223
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:06,611
<i>My child, you must forget</i>
<i>without regret</i>

224
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,937
<i>these depraved phantasms...</i>

225
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,132
<i>And you will encounter</i>
<i>a ragamuffin</i>

226
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,092
<i>or perhaps a beggar prince.</i>

227
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,416
<i>But kindly abjure</i>

228
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:21,010
<i>this union impure.</i>

229
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:25,971
<i>Life will offer you gifts,</i>
<i>my child.</i>

230
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,979
<i>But first you must</i>

231
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,058
<i>conform to the plan</i>

232
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,297
<i>which I have concocted for you.</i>

233
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,891
<i>Have no fear of getting lost.</i>

234
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,172
<i>I shall enlighten you at all cost.</i>

235
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,492
<i>I shall protect you</i>
<i>and show you the way</i>

236
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,850
<i>that I have traced without delay.</i>

237
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,096
<i>Be of good cheer...</i>

238
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,417
<i>I´ve fixed it all up, dear.</i>

239
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,139
Don´t worry. Nothing bad
will happen to you

240
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,058
if you follow my advice.

241
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,050
Are you sure?

242
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,810
Fairies are always right.

243
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,174
We must thwart your father.

244
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,577
You must tell him that you have

245
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:15,530
a whim for... Let s see...
a dress the color of the weather.

246
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,770
It´s very complicated and costly.

247
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,732
He´ll never be able
to give it to you.

248
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,250
A dress the color of the weather!
Is it a condition?

249
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,338
Oh, just a whim.

250
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,378
And you will marry me?

251
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,009
Yes, father.

252
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,013
The devil take me!

253
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,890
But what kind of weather?

254
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,772
Good weather, father.

255
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,020
What kind of weather?

256
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,734
Good weather, of course!

257
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,177
I need it tomorrow.

258
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,738
We haven´t time!

259
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,133
The color of the weather!

260
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,136
He succeeded! How dreadful!

261
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,656
Let me look at you.

262
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:08,778
It´s gorgeous!
I never saw anything like it.

263
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,618
I didn´t think it was possible.

264
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,457
He must love you very much indeed!

265
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,618
What do we do now?

266
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,179
We must be unreasonable.

267
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,978
Ask him for a dress

268
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,252
that is more sparkling,
less common...

269
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,213
A dress the color of the moon.

270
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,012
Go at once.

271
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,579
The color of the moon?

272
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,893
Yes, father, more sparkling,
less common...

273
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,650
but that one fits you perfectly.

274
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:59,689
I find it quite ordinary.

275
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,090
I would not displease you.

276
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,291
The co or of the moon?

277
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,454
Yes, father.

278
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,494
The color of the moon?

279
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,772
And even more sparkling
than the nightly orb.

280
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,850
Now he´s asking for the moon!

281
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,779
What a beautiful dress!

282
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,893
My father is so sweet! I am full
of love and ready to marry him.

283
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,295
- You can´t!
- But he´s so nice!

284
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,413
Impossible!

285
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,530
I tore my dress again.

286
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,536
How sad!

287
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,332
That´s life.

288
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,531
There is something wrong...

289
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,971
My magic spell
won´t work anymore. Is it spent?

290
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,898
Can a spell wear out
like a dress?

291
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,092
No, but it can weaken
like a battery.

292
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,530
A battery? What´s that?

293
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,175
Nothing... I´m getting old!

294
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,132
But fairies don´t get old.

295
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,649
You´re right. I had forgotten.

296
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,256
Still my power over men
has weakened.

297
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,896
My spell doesn´t work anymore
on your father.

298
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,371
I must admit
that I am very fond of him.

299
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,178
Oh no!

300
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,929
We shall conquer
this unwholesome passion.

301
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,618
We´ll be simply odious.

302
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,493
Tell him you want dress
the color of the sun.

303
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,099
He´ll give it to me.

304
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,892
We´ll see.

305
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,614
Anyway, I have another idea.

306
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,414
I think he will be surprised

307
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,895
by the request
I advise you to make.

308
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,852
What request?

309
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,493
Listen...

310
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,019
Oh no! Not that!

311
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,370
That´s horrible! I´d never dare...

312
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,332
I´d rather marry him.

313
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,859
You´ll have to do it.

314
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,059
Are you satisfied?

315
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:15,416
Frankly, I should like
a more dazzling dress...

316
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,894
the color of the sun.

317
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,815
Is this one not dazzling?

318
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,609
It could be made
of gold and diamonds.

319
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,818
Are you vain, my dear?

320
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,453
Not very.

321
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,219
Why are you teasing me?

322
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,252
You may have the dress

323
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:37,612
if you assure me
it is a sign of love and not a whim.

324
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,370
It is not a whim, father.

325
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,052
Go! Ask him what I told you.

326
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,693
Oh, I can´t.

327
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,175
Go! I command you.

328
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,898
How dazzling!

329
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,213
I have never seen
anything so radiant!

330
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,490
You are beautiful, daughter.

331
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,299
Are you happy?

332
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,128
I am, father.

333
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,177
I am filled with joy.
Is this your last request?

334
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,730
Or, before our marriage, have you

335
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,659
another desire that I can satisfy?

336
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,496
Yes, but I hesitate...

337
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,653
Tell me anyway.

338
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,409
I´d like... the skin
of that old donkey in your stables.

339
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,531
My banker?

340
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,059
Yes, father.

341
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,969
That s a strange request,
and it surprises me.

342
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,819
Who suggested
this monstrous idea to you?

343
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,817
Your fairy godmother?

344
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,499
She has despised me since...

345
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,975
- Since when, father?
- Never mind.

346
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,218
Besides, I don´t care
what the fairies think,

347
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,411
especially that one!

348
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:24,932
Well, if it is your last request
before our marriage,

349
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,653
it will be granted.

350
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:29,977
You will have
the donkey skin tonight.

351
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,458
Don´t be childish!

352
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,013
I cannot escape him.

353
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:20,377
It is cruel to make him suffer.

354
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,696
He is a ready planning the wedding.

355
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,128
That´s just too bad!

356
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:28,128
Why must I refuse his love?
What have you got against my father?

357
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,251
I need not explain to you.

358
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,853
Your father behaved badly

359
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:37,052
in an affair
involving only him and me.

360
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:41,217
Fairies, like women,
hold grudges.

361
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,412
Don´t cry.

362
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:46,817
If my father loves me,
why not do as he wishes?

363
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,248
Why flee from him?

364
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,338
I owe him my life after all.

365
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:56,018
Your education
has been sadly lacking.

366
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,974
What do you advise?

367
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,018
You must leave... quickly!

368
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,455
The King will find me
wherever I go.

369
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,048
You will be disguised.

370
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,658
You have the oddest ideas!

371
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,818
Hurry now.

372
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,136
- Wrap this skin around you.
- Oh, horrors!

373
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,173
Do as I say.
Everything is planned.

374
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,418
Where is my wand?

375
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,172
Here is a chest
for your dresses, your mirror,

376
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,052
your diamonds and rubies.

377
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,936
Take my wand too.

378
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,536
- But you...
- I have a spare one.

379
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,810
Strike the floor with the wand,

380
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,171
and your chest will appear.

381
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,738
- Come.
- Why?

382
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,699
Come here.

383
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,977
No one will recognize you.

384
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,894
You enjoy making me ugly!

385
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:21,457
Don´t be silly.
It´s going to be an ordeal.

386
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,128
Life s not so easy as you think,

387
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,456
even for the daughter of a king.

388
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,735
A coach will await you
at the gate

389
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,295
to take you to a safe place.

390
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,178
Good luck, child.

391
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,850
Lend me my wand to get home.

392
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,058
Come in, Donkey Skin.
I was expecting you.

393
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,095
I need a scullion to wash the rags.

394
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,096
Yes, Madam.

395
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,415
Call me "old woman"

396
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,815
or don´t call me at all.

397
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,330
You can start tomorrow.

398
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,899
Everybody´s asleep today.

399
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,812
You´re even dirtier than I expected.

400
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,614
By definition, a scullion is dirty.

401
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,937
You think too much.

402
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,338
- You can clean the pig trough.
- Yes, old woman.

403
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,100
I am tired from traveling.
Where can I rest?

404
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,973
There is a hut in the forest.

405
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,577
Oh, how wretched!
Where do you start?

406
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,259
The bed.

407
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,493
A chair.

408
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,849
The table.

409
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,614
A looking glass.

410
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,609
Candles.

411
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,455
And my chest.

412
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:40,655
<i>Love, love, I love you so!</i>

413
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,699
No trace of the Princess.

414
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,733
Search the stables,
the sheepfold, the cellars.

415
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,498
We searched everywhere.

416
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,453
She was sleeping
in her bedroom last night.

417
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,817
The Princess may have eloped
with some Romeo.

418
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,620
Nonsense!

419
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,291
I´m going mad!

420
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,932
Send 100 messengers,
1 000 musketeers.

421
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:12,018
Search each hamlet, vineyard,

422
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:15,053
and meadow.
Bring her back to me.

423
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:18,093
- Dead or alive?
- Alive, stupid!

424
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,730
Oh, it is too hard to bear.

425
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,817
What about the wedding?

426
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,453
Postpone it.

427
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:28,574
No wedding! No feast!
No decorations! No cake! No bells!

428
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,452
Leave me in peace.

429
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:34,016
Until you find her.

430
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,415
I can be consoled

431
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,456
only by her presence.

432
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,368
Be gone!

433
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,132
<i>Oh, how disgusting!</i>

434
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:52,137
<i>Oh, how dirty!</i>

435
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,456
<i>Oh, how filthy!</i>

436
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:24,052
<i>The poor thing!</i>
<i>She must be sick</i>

437
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,774
<i>Her skin must hide some disease.</i>

438
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,859
<i>Maybe the mange!</i>

439
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,379
<i>Just look at her!</i>

440
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:33,811
<i>You can´t tell her hands</i>
<i>from her face.</i>

441
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,132
<i>With that hair all over her!</i>

442
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:40,138
<i>She won´t have a chance</i>
<i>to see the Prince.</i>

443
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:43,338
<i>Before kissing her,</i>
<i>he´d have to wash her.</i>

444
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:47,249
<i>Her skin must smell musky.</i>

445
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,658
<i>The old lady said</i>
<i>that you must clean</i>

446
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,499
<i>the stables and the barn.</i>

447
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,459
<i>Do you know why?</i>

448
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,934
<i>How would I know?</i>

449
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,416
<i>Our Prince is coming Sunday.</i>

450
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:04,578
<i>He insists on cleanliness.</i>

451
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:07,499
<i>- She doesn´t!</i>
<i>- Oh, how disgusting!</i>

452
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,339
<i>Let´s get away from here!</i>

453
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,939
<i>She infests the air.</i>

454
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,813
<i>They say she´s evil.</i>

455
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,094
<i>You´d better hide.</i>

456
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:26,452
<i>If the Prince sees you,</i>
<i>he might throw you out.</i>

457
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:30,012
<i>You won´t be allowed</i>
<i>at the feast.</i>

458
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:35,169
<i>The King´s soldiers might take you</i>
<i>for a beast and kill you.</i>

459
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:39,652
<i>I won´t take up much room</i>
<i>nor make any noise.</i>

460
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,772
<i>But I want to see</i>
<i>the Prince go by.</i>

461
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,493
<i>After that, I´ll leave.</i>

462
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,412
<i>She wants to see the Prince!</i>

463
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,817
<i>They´ll all take flight</i>
<i>at such a sight.</i>

464
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,452
<i>What is your name, noble lady?</i>

465
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:02,256
<i>- They call me Donkey Skin.</i>
<i>- Is it your skin that stinks?</i>

466
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:07,409
<i>- I think it is her body.</i>
<i>- I´ve never seen anything so ugly.</i>

467
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:24,095
<i>Am I really guilty?</i>
<i>Of what crime?</i>

468
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:27,576
<i>I don´t deserve such wretchedness.</i>

469
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:31,216
<i>Unless a Prince Charming</i>
<i>comes for me,</i>

470
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:36,369
<i>I vow here and now</i>
<i>to go out and find him.</i>

471
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,973
Are we a most there?

472
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,898
Almost, Sire.

473
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,936
You have eaten nothing.

474
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,859
I am not hungry.

475
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:48,096
Is something bothering you?

476
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,734
I was thinking
how odd the world is.

477
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,056
They say
it may stop turning.

478
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,410
The fairies won´t let it.

479
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:58,817
- I don´t believe in them.
- I do.

480
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:03,737
Fairies are our inner force.
They make us act, for good or evil.

481
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,179
Excuse me.

482
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,009
I need calm.

483
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:12,292
- I´ll go with you.
- I didn´t say I needed company.

484
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:34,295
<i>Love hides within the heart,</i>

485
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,412
<i>like a thief.</i>

486
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:41,454
<i>And secretly plans</i>

487
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:44,174
<i>its downfall.</i>

488
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:47,497
<i>Like a worm inside a cherry,</i>

489
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:51,170
<i>recalling happy days.</i>

490
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,414
Are you bored, Prince?

491
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:08,248
Never, Rose...

492
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,458
There is so much to be done,

493
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:13,409
to discover, to understand.

494
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,611
Is it love you seek?

495
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:19,213
Of course... like everyone else.

496
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:22,657
Then follow the path.
You can trust me.

497
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,819
Thank you, Rose.

498
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:33,137
<i>Love, love, I love you so.</i>

499
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,696
<i>Love, love, I love you so.</i>

500
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:53,176
<i>Why are you knocking at my door?</i>

501
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,658
<i>I have waited so long</i>

502
00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:00,489
<i>for you to bring me happiness.</i>

503
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,209
<i>Love, love, I love you so.</i>

504
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:01,650
Tell me, woman,
who is that princess in the forest?

505
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:06,092
- Not a princess. A scullion, Sire.
- She has the loveliest face.

506
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,649
Little Red Riding Hood, perhaps!

507
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,091
She is a lowly servant.

508
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,178
They call her Donkey Skin.

509
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,620
- Donkey Skin?
- Donkey Skin!

510
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,259
What a pretty name!

511
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:23,808
Kind sir...

512
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:27,211
wine and sun have muddled you.

513
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,570
I have not tasted of wine,

514
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:32,578
and the sun shone
only to lead me to her.

515
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,776
You look mysterious, Sire.

516
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:45,779
I just saw an angel!

517
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:46,935
What the devil!

518
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:50,576
<i>Hang me</i>

519
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:53,248
<i>if I did not dream it.</i>

520
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:56,418
<i>I wonder</i>

521
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,369
<i>if I haven´t found</i>

522
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:02,856
<i>love in my path.</i>

523
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:06,848
<i>Love that makes wise men go mad...</i>

524
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,893
<i>I seemed to recognize</i>

525
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:12,973
<i>love´s features.</i>

526
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:17,577
<i>So young,</i>

527
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:20,738
<i>so graceful, so lovely,</i>

528
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:24,250
<i>so tender,</i>

529
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,850
<i>so serene.</i>

530
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:30,370
<i>My life depends upon her...</i>

531
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:33,936
<i>I shall live for her alone.</i>

532
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:37,291
<i>Her love</i>

533
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:41,379
<i>must belong to me.</i>

534
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:45,608
<i>I had no hope.</i>

535
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:47,936
<i>I was desperate.</i>

536
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:51,530
<i>I went on living joylessly.</i>

537
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,890
<i>Then she appeared,</i>

538
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:57,172
<i>lovelier than an angel...</i>

539
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:00,019
<i>come down among us men.</i>

540
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:04,975
<i>I would give my life for her,</i>

541
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:09,614
<i>even if I were hanged.</i>

542
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:14,893
<i>I must see her again.</i>

543
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:18,052
<i>I do not wish to die</i>

544
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:22,049
<i>of love.</i>

545
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,048
You tremble, Sire.

546
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:29,219
- There´s a spell upon him.
- Yes. What joy!

547
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:32,180
Prepare the horses. We´re leaving.

548
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,413
Were you asleep?

549
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,655
I thought I heard you.

550
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:15,850
We didn´t expect you
until tomorrow.

551
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:17,379
I´m not cross

552
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:20,458
but you know how I worry
when you travel.

553
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,696
Did you have a good trip?

554
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,611
What do you mean by that?

555
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:33,133
That father should do something
about his kingdom.

556
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:39,093
There are still scullions
living in huts.

557
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,416
Take it up with your father.

558
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:44,259
You look upset. Are you ill?

559
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:48,372
I have ridden 50 leagues.
I am tired.

560
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:51,056
- You´re burn ng up.
- I´m exhausted.

561
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:53,854
You gallop like mad.
You have a fever.

562
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:55,698
Are you ill?

563
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,858
Just my luck!

564
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:01,973
For your return, I arranged
the ball of the Cats and the Birds.

565
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:04,171
The Marchioness of Carabas
is coming.

566
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:06,769
All the Princesses want to see you.

567
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:09,855
Shall I call the doctor?

568
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:11,379
No! Thank you.

569
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:13,889
Leave me. I need to rest.

570
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:05,136
Where is your son?
Must we beg him to come?

571
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:06,978
I sent for him three times.

572
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:09,455
Does he know
the ball is in his honor?

573
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,616
Yes. He says
he doesn´t feel well.

574
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:14,618
- Where is he?
- He refuses to leave his room.

575
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:16,617
That isn´t like him.

576
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:18,658
Has he a secret?

577
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:20,452
Not that I know of.

578
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:24,371
- Has he eaten?
- He didn´t touch his food.

579
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:27,174
- I´ll go get him.
- No... I´ll go.

580
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:40,250
Madame de Ségur is looking for you.

581
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:43,020
Madame de Cléves
has traveled four days.

582
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:45,370
They are all asking for you.

583
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:49,090
They are all silly wenches.
I want to see that girl.

584
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:51,771
I want to marry her.

585
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:54,369
I tell you she is a scullion.

586
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:56,931
I tell you she´s a beauty.

587
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:59,859
There is much talk
about your absence.

588
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:03,450
If you tell them
you want to marry a scullion,

589
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,173
they´ll lock you up.

590
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:07,133
You are right.

591
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:10,135
But I must find a way to see her.

592
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:13,657
Until I do,
I will not leave my room.

593
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:15,737
I´ll be sick in bed.

594
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,699
I have spoken!

595
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:21,054
What did you say?

596
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:22,613
Your Majesty...

597
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,772
Leave us, Godefroy.

598
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:28,138
- The King is worried about you.
- He needn´t be.

599
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:31,457
- You don´t eat.
- I don´t feel like it.

600
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:35,096
You left the hunt,
you wouldn´t see the play,

601
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,256
you refused
to come to the ball.

602
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,849
Everything seems to bore you.

603
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:44,657
Is there nothing that I can do
to amuse you?

604
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:49,852
There is only one thing

605
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:51,819
that would amuse me.

606
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:55,579
Just name it, and it wil be done.

607
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,937
A cake made by Donkey Skin.

608
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:01,410
Who?

609
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:04,776
Donkey Skin. You don´t know her.

610
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,536
But you aren´t hungry.

611
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:11,058
It´s the only thing I really want.

612
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:15,854
I know it seems commonplace.

613
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:17,859
A cake...

614
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:20,139
Donkey Skin?

615
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,332
Get some rest, child.

616
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:38,693
Thibaud, I want
to ask you a question.

617
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,255
- A riddle?
- No, a question.

618
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:46,772
Do you know Donkey Skin?

619
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:51,337
Yes, Your Majesty. She is
the ugliest beast, except the wolf.

620
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:54,094
And she stinks!

621
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:55,574
Who´s she?

622
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:59,295
A filthy thing that lives
in one of your pigsties...

623
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,377
your farms.
She keeps the pigs.

624
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:02,808
Filthy or not, go!

625
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:05,614
The Prince wants her
to make him a cake.

626
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:08,015
I won´t get there before daybreak.

627
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:09,539
Then go quickly!

628
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:13,130
Go... quickly... Right.

629
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:15,854
She must be a good cook.

630
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:31,613
We´re here.

631
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:42,329
- Are you Donkey Skin?
- Yes, sir.

632
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,735
I am the Queen´s overseer.

633
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:50,378
The Prince, who is ill,
requests a cake... made by you.

634
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:53,294
- Do you have what you need?
- Yes, sir.

635
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,378
Hurry, scullion... We´ll wait.

636
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,011
I hope she washes her hands.

637
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:11,172
A cake for the Prince! My cookbook!

638
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:26,739
An apple savarin...
A rum alaska...

639
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:29,579
A walnut delight.<i>..</i>
King´s cream puffs...

640
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:33,612
An apricot cobbler...
A plum soufflé...

641
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:37,051
Strawberry shortcake...
A pineapple charlotte...

642
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:40,657
A love cake!

643
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:43,496
My dress the color of the sun!

644
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:10,499
<i>Prepare your dough...</i>

645
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:15,452
<i>...in a flat bows.</i>

646
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:24,729
<i>Light your oven.</i>

647
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:36,098
<i>Take some flour.</i>

648
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:41,290
<i>Pour it in the bowl.</i>

649
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:44,731
<i>Four full handful.</i>

650
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:50,209
<i>Make a lillle hole in it.</i>

651
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,732
<i>Choose four fresh eggs...</i>

652
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:59,770
<i>...laid the very morning.</i>

653
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:02,972
<i>For 20 days later...</i>

654
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:08,052
<i>...a chick is bound to appear.</i>

655
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,297
<i>A whole bowl of milk...</i>

656
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:25,330
<i>...nice and creamy if you please.</i>

657
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:28,976
<i>Sprinkle with sugar.</i>

658
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:33,851
<i>And mix well.</i>

659
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:38,897
<i>A handful of sweet butter...</i>

660
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:43,895
<i>A pinch of baking powder...</i>

661
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:47,456
<i>A drop of honey...</i>

662
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:52,695
<i>And a dash of salt.</i>

663
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:04,132
<i>And now it is time...</i>

664
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:08,579
<i>...wlise kneading the dough,</i>

665
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:12,736
<i>to slip in a present...</i>

666
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:17,935
<i>...for your betrothed.</i>

667
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,016
<i>Make a wish</i>

668
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:27,532
<i>while the dough is resting.</i>

669
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:31,176
<i>Butter the dish...</i>

670
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:38,259
<i>...and bake one hour.</i>

671
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:20,819
Oh, my skin!

672
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:32,251
Get up, lazybones.

673
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:40,814
Don´t keep the Prince waiting.

674
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:42,499
Hurry up!

675
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,777
- How´s he?
- I can´t tell.

676
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:11,335
He is delirious but he has no fever.

677
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:13,258
Aren´t there any fairies around?

678
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:16,099
They´re all busy.
It´s the full moon.

679
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:17,574
But you are scientists!

680
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:20,493
The case s unprecedented.

681
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:23,250
Here is the cake.

682
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:29,575
Is it good?

683
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:31,736
I don´t know. I don´t like cake.

684
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:33,293
What do you think?

685
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,651
It smells like good butter.

686
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:40,459
Excellent!

687
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:46,173
Here, child.

688
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:49,054
Taste it when you feel like it.

689
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:50,773
I´m not very hungry.

690
01:03:57,740 --> 01:03:59,458
He shouldn´t eat so fast.

691
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:01,651
He´ll get air in his blood.

692
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:04,699
He´s choking!

693
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:07,892
Do something! He´s been poisoned!

694
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,855
He hasn´t eaten for 3 days.

695
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:12,857
Give him a glass of water.

696
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:17,933
Thank you all.

697
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:19,892
The cake was delicious!

698
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:21,733
I feel much better.

699
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:24,738
Now I want to sleep. Leave me.

700
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,934
We must not irritate him.

701
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:40,099
His illness s characterized
by fluctuations.

702
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,734
The cough is only temporary.

703
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:43,732
<i>I knew not that you loved me.</i>

704
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:48,417
<i>Do you know it now?</i>

705
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:52,408
<i>A golden ring told me so.</i>

706
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:56,295
<i>There must be a spell on us.</i>

707
01:05:56,860 --> 01:06:00,978
<i>But what will we do</i>
<i>with so much happiness?</i>

708
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:06,579
<i>Let it be seen</i>
<i>or keep it a secret?</i>

709
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:30,573
<i>Together we will make our life</i>

710
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:35,172
<i>as no others have ever done.</i>

711
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:39,134
<i>Our love will be a legend.</i>

712
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:43,015
<i>And we will live long in memory.</i>

713
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:47,213
<i>But what will we do</i>
<i>with so much love?</i>

714
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:52,488
<i>Let it be seen</i>
<i>or keep it a secret?</i>

715
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:57,458
<i>We´ll do whatever is forbidden...</i>

716
01:06:57,740 --> 01:07:02,211
<i>We´ll go together to the snack bar.</i>

717
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:06,652
<i>We´ll smoke a pipe in secret.</i>

718
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:10,409
<i>We´ll stuff ourselves on cake!</i>

719
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:14,818
<i>But what will we do</i>
<i>with so much joy?</i>

720
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:20,572
<i>Life is full of it!</i>

721
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:07,453
<i>We´ll do whatever is forbidden.</i>

722
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:11,933
<i>We´ll go together to the snack bar.</i>

723
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:16,292
<i>We´ll smoke a pipe in secret.</i>

724
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:20,413
<i>We´ll stuff ourselves on cake!</i>

725
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:46,131
<i>But what will we do</i>
<i>with so much joy?</i>

726
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:51,335
<i>Life is full of it!</i>

727
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:56,892
<i>We´ll have a great many children...</i>

728
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:03,448
<i>...and live happily ever after.</i>

729
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:19,578
The doctors!

730
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:32,451
Have you looked in your books?

731
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:33,934
Yes, Your Majesty.

732
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:37,291
We are all in agreement
about the diagnosis.

733
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:38,455
Tell us!

734
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:41,170
The Prince is dying of love.

735
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:44,770
- Love?
- I knew it!

736
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:46,529
What do you advise?

737
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:48,691
Marriage, Your Majesty.

738
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:50,817
Is it urgent?

739
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:54,252
The sooner the better.

740
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:58,135
Thank you for your wise counsel.

741
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:00,013
We´ll think about it.

742
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,931
I can´t handle this.
You take care of it.

743
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:09,773
As you wish.

744
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:12,814
Wait! I´ll go with you.

745
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:30,295
My son... My dear son.

746
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:31,649
My dear child...

747
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:33,578
We know everything.

748
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:34,735
You´re lucky!

749
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:38,296
You shall have her.
Whether she be stupid or ugly.

750
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:39,694
Oh, not that!

751
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:41,413
You promised!

752
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:43,133
Tell us her name.

753
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:46,173
I do not wish to distress you

754
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:48,530
but I can´t give you her name.

755
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:49,849
Look...

756
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:53,098
I shall marry
the girl who can wear this ring.

757
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:54,779
What ring is this?

758
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:57,335
- Who gave it to you?
- No questions!

759
01:10:57,540 --> 01:10:59,496
- We could...
- No! I know you.

760
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:02,817
If I tell you this much,
you´ll want that much.

761
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:07,177
I will command the ladies to come...

762
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:09,098
...to try the ring on.

763
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:11,819
Thank you.

764
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:35,419
By order of the King!

765
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:39,579
All maidens
are to come to the palace

766
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:41,930
to try on a ring.

767
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:43,579
Hear ye!

768
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:45,611
Maidens only...

769
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:48,972
The one whom the ring fits perfectly

770
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:53,332
will marry the Prince,
heir to the throne.

771
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:56,054
Hear ye!

772
01:11:56,260 --> 01:11:58,728
The ring is very small,

773
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:02,057
and the finger must be slender.

774
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:10,455
<i>Come hither, ladies!</i>

775
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:14,892
<i>This elixir of gazelle milk</i>
<i>will make your finger so slender</i>

776
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:17,853
<i>that you will wed the Prince.</i>

777
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:20,975
<i>This way, my beauties!!</i>

778
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:25,658
<i>I´ll make you a slender finger,</i>
<i>smoother than a plum.</i>

779
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:29,296
<i>And the Prince</i>
<i>will fall head over heels.</i>

780
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:34,573
<i>I´ve got a miracle salve</i>

781
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:36,976
<i>to make fingers slender.</i>

782
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:39,057
<i>Open the bottle.</i>

783
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:43,538
<i>Rub it in well.</i>

784
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:48,088
<i>Push harder, lazybones!</i>

785
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:50,450
<i>I´m afraid of hurting you.</i>

786
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:52,696
<i>Are you as stupid as you seem?</i>

787
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:56,256
<i>Push it down</i>
<i>until I tell you to stop!</i>

788
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:01,574
<i>Mother, hurry!</i>

789
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:03,971
<i>The Prince is waiting for us.</i>

790
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:06,091
<i>My finger is getting thinner!</i>

791
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:09,372
<i>Mine will fit the golden ring.</i>

792
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:12,458
<i>My skin is peeling off!</i>

793
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:14,696
<i>Mine is down to the bone!</i>

794
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:17,175
<i>It serves you right,</i>

795
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:20,178
<i>you giddy girls!</i>

796
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:23,089
<i>The cad! The quack!</i>

797
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:25,650
<i>Look at my finger.</i>

798
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:27,657
<i>It sooks terribses</i>

799
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:31,648
<i>Look at mine. It´s twice as fats</i>

800
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:34,769
<i>They´re so silly!</i>

801
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:36,493
<i>He´s jealous.</i>

802
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:39,090
<i>All that just to marry a prince!</i>

803
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:41,097
<i>You´re a naughty rogues</i>

804
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:44,531
<i>Ouch! You´re pinching me!</i>

805
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:45,377
<i>Help!</i>

806
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:47,696
<i>What is it, Esther?</i>

807
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:48,650
<i>I cut it!</i>

808
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:49,895
<i>Serves her right!</i>

809
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:51,897
<i>Make him go away!</i>

810
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:55,934
<i>You must suffer to be beautiful!</i>

811
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:19,218
First the Princesses.

812
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:23,415
Then the Duchesses.

813
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:25,813
Then the Marchionesses.

814
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:30,849
What a crowd!

815
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:33,130
What if it fits several of them?

816
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:34,773
No chance of that!

817
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:38,812
But if there were?

818
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:42,298
I hadn´t thought of that.

819
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:50,696
Calm down! There´s no hurry.

820
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:52,931
And please don´t push!

821
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:56,338
The countesses...

822
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:59,617
The behinds...
I mean, the baronnesses behind.

823
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:36,136
Sorry.

824
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:38,979
I have the smallest finger
in the county!

825
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:43,459
Next...

826
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:58,892
Come back in a few years.

827
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:01,091
With pleasure, Your Highness.

828
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:21,251
Almost, but not quite...

829
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:35,291
The maids first, then the cooks.

830
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:38,014
The turkey keepers
and scullions last.

831
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:44,375
Stop your crackling...
I mean, your cackling!

832
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:52,172
Miss Gauthier, servant at the castle.

833
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:02,613
Miss Nicolette, cook.

834
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:18,412
Miss Saltandpepper, turkey keeper.

835
01:18:33,198 --> 01:18:36,190
Miss Glum, unemployed.

836
01:18:41,758 --> 01:18:44,272
Is it worth trying?

837
01:18:44,638 --> 01:18:46,117
Give me your hand.

838
01:18:46,318 --> 01:18:47,990
No, the other one.

839
01:18:53,158 --> 01:18:54,796
I told you so.

840
01:18:56,558 --> 01:18:58,116
Is there no one else?

841
01:19:02,398 --> 01:19:03,911
No, Your Highness.

842
01:19:13,278 --> 01:19:15,428
There is no one else, Your Majesty.

843
01:19:16,678 --> 01:19:18,111
My dear child...

844
01:19:18,598 --> 01:19:22,034
Every lady of the realm
answered your summons.

845
01:19:22,478 --> 01:19:24,787
None of them could wear the ring.

846
01:19:25,318 --> 01:19:27,229
I am very sorry.

847
01:19:27,718 --> 01:19:29,754
I am surprised.

848
01:19:29,958 --> 01:19:32,233
This ring must belong to someone.

849
01:19:33,198 --> 01:19:36,588
I don´t think I saw Donkey Skin,

850
01:19:37,038 --> 01:19:39,233
the girl who made me a cake.

851
01:19:40,158 --> 01:19:42,194
Did no one inform her?

852
01:19:42,798 --> 01:19:44,629
I don t know, Your Majesty.

853
01:19:44,838 --> 01:19:46,908
Bring her here immediately.

854
01:19:50,318 --> 01:19:51,876
Here she is, Your Majesty.

855
01:20:07,678 --> 01:20:10,397
Do you live
at the third farm down the road?

856
01:20:10,598 --> 01:20:11,917
Yes, Your Majesty.

857
01:20:12,518 --> 01:20:13,917
Show me your hand.

858
01:22:24,398 --> 01:22:26,593
Oh darling!
I´m marrying your father.

859
01:22:26,798 --> 01:22:28,675
Try to look pleased.

860
01:22:30,158 --> 01:22:31,511
My daughter!

861
01:22:32,158 --> 01:22:34,513
My dear daughter!

862
01:22:34,718 --> 01:22:36,754
We´ll never be parted again.

863
01:22:50,958 --> 01:22:52,471
<i>The festivities</i>

864
01:22:53,158 --> 01:22:55,149
<i>lasted almost three months.</i>

865
01:22:55,358 --> 01:22:57,189
<i>Kings came from everywhere.</i>

866
01:22:57,558 --> 01:23:01,346
<i>The King of India with his elephant,</i>
<i>the King of Africa with his camel,</i>

867
01:23:01,558 --> 01:23:06,029
<i>the King of Siam with his cats</i>
<i>and coaches and sedan chairs.</i>

868
01:23:06,798 --> 01:23:09,995
<i>They say that the couple</i>
<i>would still be in sove</i>

869
01:23:10,198 --> 01:23:13,031
<i>if they hadn´t died</i>
<i>a hundred years later.</i>

870
01:23:13,838 --> 01:23:17,148
<i>The tale is perhaps</i>
<i>difficult to believe</i>

871
01:23:17,798 --> 01:23:22,394
<i>but as long as there are children</i>
<i>and mothers and grandmothers,</i>

872
01:23:23,078 --> 01:23:25,433
<i>it will be remembered.</i>
