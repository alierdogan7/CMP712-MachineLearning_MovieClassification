1
00:00:06,042 --> 00:00:07,071
All right, kids;
Show me what you got.

2
00:00:07,072 --> 00:00:10,091
Ready? Five, six,
seven, eight.

3
00:00:10,092 --> 00:00:13,087
Welcome to NYADA.

4
00:00:13,088 --> 00:00:16,066
This is Dance 101,
my name's Cassandra July,

5
00:00:16,067 --> 00:00:19,016
and if you are not suffering
from severe body dysmorphia,

6
00:00:19,017 --> 00:00:22,003
then you don't want it enough.

7
00:00:22,004 --> 00:00:24,000
Let's get this straight,
freshmen:

8
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:26,016
There's maybe two
of you in this room

9
00:00:26,017 --> 00:00:28,002
that are good enough
to make it in this business.

10
00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:29,033
As for the rest of you,

11
00:00:29,034 --> 00:00:31,078
thank you for paying my rent

12
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:34,087
on my loft in SoHo.

13
00:00:34,088 --> 00:00:36,041
Hey. What's your name?

14
00:00:36,042 --> 00:00:37,095
Uh, Lydia.

15
00:00:37,096 --> 00:00:40,016
No, no, your name's Muffin Top,

16
00:00:40,017 --> 00:00:42,061
and from now on,
it's rice cakes and ipecac.

17
00:00:42,062 --> 00:00:45,042
Or cut off a butt cheek,
'cause you need to drop a few.

18
00:00:47,038 --> 00:00:49,024
Hold it.

19
00:00:49,025 --> 00:00:50,074
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:50,075 --> 00:00:54,074
Did my conversation with
Muffin Top offend you?

21
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:56,004
- No.
- Hmm?

22
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:57,038
What's your name?

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,012
- Rachel.
- Little Miss...

24
00:00:59,015 --> 00:01:01,088
- David Schwimmer?
- Little Miss David Schwimmer.

25
00:01:01,091 --> 00:01:05,020
I bet you were
a big star back in Iowa.

26
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:07,012
- I'm actually from Ohio.
- Ohio.

27
00:01:07,013 --> 00:01:08,046
That's even worse.

28
00:01:08,047 --> 00:01:10,028
You ever look at a map?

29
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:12,003
Ohio is like a giant turd

30
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:13,079
that Michigan just
can't pinch off.

31
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,011
So did you come all the way
to New York City

32
00:01:16,012 --> 00:01:17,071
to show me how to run my class?

33
00:01:17,072 --> 00:01:20,058
- No, I... I came to learn.
- Okay.

34
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:22,028
Lesson number one:

35
00:01:22,029 --> 00:01:23,088
Your piqué turns are pathetic,

36
00:01:23,089 --> 00:01:25,091
and your stuck-up
little attitude's

37
00:01:25,092 --> 00:01:28,000
really pissing me off.
Music!

38
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:32,028
All right, let's go!

39
00:01:32,029 --> 00:01:34,045
Energy in your fingers.

40
00:01:34,046 --> 00:01:36,024
Higher. Higher.

41
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:38,020
Into the ground.
Higher!

42
00:01:38,021 --> 00:01:39,083
Higher, higher!

43
00:01:39,084 --> 00:01:42,046
- Come on!
- I don't need any help.

44
00:01:42,047 --> 00:01:44,017
No, no, sweetie, I'm not
coming down here to help you.

45
00:01:44,018 --> 00:01:47,016
I'm coming down here to give you
a big New York City welcome.

46
00:01:47,017 --> 00:01:49,017
You suck.

47
00:01:49,633 --> 00:01:52,855

<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

48
00:01:56,038 --> 00:01:57,616
What's up, blogosphere?

49
00:01:57,652 --> 00:01:59,722
Jacob Ben Israel here,
back on the street

50
00:01:59,723 --> 00:02:03,659
with an exclusive look at
McKinley's newest celebrities,

51
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,710
the New Directions!

52
00:02:04,711 --> 00:02:07,651
Artie Abrams,
lunch room sources tell me

53
00:02:07,652 --> 00:02:09,651
you've been seen
sitting with Cheerios!

54
00:02:09,652 --> 00:02:11,638
Well, I'm usually sitting.

55
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:14,651
But, yes, and I can tell you it
is great to finally be popular.

56
00:02:14,652 --> 00:02:16,151
National champs, baby!

57
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:17,232
Whoo!

58
00:02:17,233 --> 00:02:19,182
Sam Evans: from hobo stripper

59
00:02:19,183 --> 00:02:21,173
to glee club celebrity.

60
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,216
- How does it feel?
- Awesome, and about time.

61
00:02:23,217 --> 00:02:25,177
I never thought
I'd have a freshman

62
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:26,204
for a personal assistant.

63
00:02:28,183 --> 00:02:30,190
This isn't organic.

64
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,178
Wow. "C You Next Tina."

65
00:02:32,179 --> 00:02:33,250
Do Taylor Lautner again.

66
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:35,199
Bella, I love you.

67
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,229
And I am a werewolf.

68
00:02:38,183 --> 00:02:40,164
Is it true you broke up
with Mike Chang

69
00:02:40,165 --> 00:02:41,185
a week after tattooing

70
00:02:41,186 --> 00:02:42,250
"Mike Chang 4ever" on your hip

71
00:02:42,251 --> 00:02:45,161
because the long-distance
thing was too hard?

72
00:02:45,162 --> 00:02:47,165
Um... okay.

73
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,178
I still love him,
and we're still friends,

74
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:52,253
and I changed the tattoo
to "Make Change 4ever."

75
00:02:52,254 --> 00:02:54,228
Change is good.

76
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:58,211
They said Rachel Berry was
the group's undisputed star,

77
00:02:58,212 --> 00:03:02,161
so, really,
the only question is:

78
00:03:02,162 --> 00:03:04,215
Which one of you
is the new Rachel?

79
00:03:04,216 --> 00:03:06,162
- I am. - I am.
- I am.

80
00:03:09,258 --> 00:03:12,178
<i>It's nice to know I'm missed.</i>

81
00:03:12,179 --> 00:03:14,162
<i>New York can make
a girl feel lonely.</i>

82
00:03:14,163 --> 00:03:16,165
<i>I miss my dads.
I miss Finn.</i>

83
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,257
<i>I haven't heard
from him in two months.</i>

84
00:03:18,258 --> 00:03:21,203
<i>Maybe he's just trying to
give me the space I need</i>

85
00:03:21,204 --> 00:03:24,165
<i>to make it on my own.
Surrender, right?</i>

86
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,191
<i>I'm sure that's it.</i>

87
00:03:25,192 --> 00:03:27,190
<i>My roommate seems nice.</i>

88
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:30,182
<i>Well, I haven't
officially met her.</i>

89
00:03:30,183 --> 00:03:32,227
<i>She's usually busy with
company, but she sounds nice.</i>

90
00:03:32,228 --> 00:03:34,233
<i>I just wish Kurt had
gotten into NYADA with me.</i>

91
00:03:36,204 --> 00:03:38,222
<i>The co-ed bathrooms take
some getting used to.</i>

92
00:03:38,223 --> 00:03:40,202
<i>I got tired of
everyone's opinion</i>

93
00:03:40,203 --> 00:03:42,181
<i>of my extensive
nighttime ritual,</i>

94
00:03:42,182 --> 00:03:44,191
<i>so I started showering
at 3:00 in the morning</i>

95
00:03:44,192 --> 00:03:46,245

Hey.
You're a freshman, right?

106
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,210
Yeah, I'm Rachel Berry.

107
00:04:29,211 --> 00:04:30,241
I'm majoring in
musical theater.

108
00:04:30,242 --> 00:04:33,190
Me, too.
Brody Weston.

109
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:35,187
- I'm a junior.
- Hi.

110
00:04:35,188 --> 00:04:36,241
Well, you survived

111
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:40,169
your first class with Cassie,
so you must be good.

112
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,166
- Is she, uh, always that awful?
- Yeah, she's tough.

113
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:45,243
But I wouldn't have gotten that
chorus gig in the revival of

114
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:47,237
<i>Working </i>last summer if
she didn't push me so hard.

115
00:04:47,238 --> 00:04:49,169
You were on Broadway?

116
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,194
Steel Worker Number Three.

117
00:04:51,195 --> 00:04:53,170
Show lasted for, like,
three performances,

118
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:55,359
but still...

119
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,318
I like to come in here
at night, too.

120
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:00,292
People give me a hard time
about my moisturizing ritual.

121
00:05:00,293 --> 00:05:02,310
- Me, too.
- We're actors, right?

122
00:05:02,313 --> 00:05:05,364
Our skin is like our
paintbrush <i>and </i>our canvas.

123
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,350
Actually, I'm not really
sleeping much, lately.

124
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,346
Not a lot of city noise
in Lima, Ohio.

125
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:15,283
I just think everything takes

126
00:05:15,284 --> 00:05:17,304
a little getting used to, but...
yeah.

127
00:05:17,305 --> 00:05:19,342
You'll be fine.

128
00:05:19,343 --> 00:05:21,288
Just remember, you're here

129
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:24,272
because you're the best
of the best.

130
00:05:25,293 --> 00:05:27,293
Start believing that.

131
00:05:29,343 --> 00:05:31,282
Oh, and, in case
you were wondering...

132
00:05:31,283 --> 00:05:32,318
which you were...

133
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,301
I'm straight.

134
00:05:36,364 --> 00:05:38,329
So he was wearing a towel

135
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,360
that was barely covering
his tinkletube,

136
00:05:39,361 --> 00:05:41,350
and he's straight? Hot.

137
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:42,358
Do you like him?

138
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:44,339
No, you know I'll
always love Finn.

139
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,342
Oh, and I love you,
I miss you like crazy,

140
00:05:46,343 --> 00:05:48,355
Oh, is that why you're
calling me every three hours?

141
00:05:48,356 --> 00:05:50,355
Well, I just want to make
sure that you're okay.

142
00:05:50,356 --> 00:05:52,359
I'm great, I love it here.

143
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,367
My dance teacher worships me.

144
00:05:54,368 --> 00:05:56,304
But how are you?
Are you okay?

145
00:05:56,305 --> 00:05:58,355
- I'm keeping busy.
- Where are you right now?

146
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,367
I just passed Mrs. Hagberg's
old classroom.

147
00:06:00,368 --> 00:06:03,346
Figured I'd stop by McKinley
and meet their newest addition.

148
00:06:03,347 --> 00:06:07,304
Porcelain, this is
my daughter Robin.

149
00:06:07,305 --> 00:06:10,367
I've loved the name ever since
I was a little girl.

150
00:06:10,368 --> 00:06:14,288
It recalls hope, and springtime,

151
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:16,329
and my favorite dead Bee Gee.

152
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,325
Oh, she's the love of my life.

153
00:06:18,326 --> 00:06:22,367
And I'm so...
so devoted to her.

154
00:06:22,368 --> 00:06:24,300
Kitty! Get in here.

155
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,366
Yes, Coach Sylvester?

156
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:27,303
I need you to
change Robin's diaper,

157
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,364
and then sing her a lullaby.

158
00:06:28,365 --> 00:06:32,359
Preferably something not yet
butchered by the glee club.

159
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,300
Good luck finding one.

160
00:06:34,301 --> 00:06:36,279
Porcelain, this is Kitty.

161
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,322
Kitty is my new head bitch.

162
00:06:37,323 --> 00:06:39,300
She's like a young Quinn Fabray,

163
00:06:39,301 --> 00:06:40,341
except she's not pregnant,
manic-depressive,

164
00:06:40,342 --> 00:06:41,362
or in and out of a wheelchair.

165
00:06:41,363 --> 00:06:43,351
Shouldn't you be
in college or something?

166
00:06:43,352 --> 00:06:46,367
I thought gay people were
all successful overachievers.

167
00:06:46,368 --> 00:06:49,351
- I am a successful...
- Oh, don't pay attention to what Kitty thinks,

168
00:06:49,354 --> 00:06:52,321
Even if it's exactly what
the rest of the world thinks.

169
00:06:52,322 --> 00:06:55,275
I'm actually very proud
of you, Twinkletush.

170
00:06:55,276 --> 00:06:56,330
You're a real trailblazer.

171
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:58,288
You know, it used to be

172
00:06:58,289 --> 00:06:59,324
that just straight
ex-football players

173
00:06:59,325 --> 00:07:01,295
would lurk the halls
of high schools

174
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,349
after graduation,
but you've proven that

175
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,310
gay ex-show choir champs
can also be

176
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:07,313
depressive sad sacks desperately
clinging to the past.

177
00:07:07,314 --> 00:07:08,353
I'm not a sad sack, okay?

178
00:07:08,354 --> 00:07:10,270
My classes at Allen County
Community College

179
00:07:10,271 --> 00:07:11,349
start next week...

180
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,347
I'm sorry, I tuned out the
moment you opened your mouth.

181
00:07:13,348 --> 00:07:16,304
Keep living the dream,
Porcelain.

182
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:17,334
Glee!

183
00:07:19,364 --> 00:07:21,347
We are coming off of
a National Championship,

184
00:07:21,348 --> 00:07:24,288
but it's time to look forward,

185
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:25,347
And thanks to Glee now being
the coolest club in the school,

186
00:07:25,348 --> 00:07:27,330
- Whoo!
- Right on.

187
00:07:27,331 --> 00:07:28,334
This shouldn't be a problem.

188
00:07:29,368 --> 00:07:31,330
All right.

189
00:07:34,351 --> 00:07:36,304
Yes, we've lost some big voices.

190
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:38,278
But we still have
some huge ones in here.

191
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,320
And I promise to do
everything I can

192
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:40,351
to replace the ones
that we lost.

193
00:07:40,352 --> 00:07:43,363
And on that note,
I'd like to introduce you

194
00:07:43,364 --> 00:07:46,313
to our newest member: The MVP
of last year's nationals,

195
00:07:46,314 --> 00:07:48,284
Wade "Unique" Adams.

196
00:07:49,364 --> 00:07:50,360
That's a great haircut,
Mercedes.

197
00:07:50,361 --> 00:07:52,342
I thought you graduated.

198
00:07:52,343 --> 00:07:54,347
I wanted to be somewhere where
different was celebrated.

199
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:57,330
We are so excited to have you.

200
00:07:58,355 --> 00:08:01,321
Guys... where's the love?

201
00:08:01,322 --> 00:08:03,301
I think Wade is great,
but the competition

202
00:08:03,302 --> 00:08:05,363
to be the new Rachel
is already so intense,

203
00:08:05,364 --> 00:08:09,301
- the last thing that we need is one more contender.
- "The New Rachel"?

204
00:08:09,302 --> 00:08:11,270
Every glee club needs
a star performer.

205
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:12,339
Rachel was that,
and now that she's gone,

206
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,329
many of us want the job.

207
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,292
Okay, we don't win with stars.

208
00:08:16,293 --> 00:08:17,303
We win as a team.

209
00:08:17,304 --> 00:08:18,355
One that supports new members.

210
00:08:18,356 --> 00:08:20,355
Now, I don't want to hear
any more of this...

211
00:08:20,356 --> 00:08:22,313
this "New Rachel" stuff, okay?

212
00:08:22,314 --> 00:08:24,334
Have a seat, Wade.

213
00:08:28,293 --> 00:08:29,326
Make no mistake:

214
00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:31,343
Unique will be the new Rachel.

215
00:08:33,284 --> 00:08:34,351
We decide this
on our own, then...

216
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:36,283
Thunderdome style.

217
00:08:36,284 --> 00:08:38,284
5:00, in the auditorium.

218
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,349
So, here are the rules:

219
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,360
We perform the song for Artie,
he makes his choice,

220
00:08:46,361 --> 00:08:48,317
we go to Mr. Shue as a group,

221
00:08:48,318 --> 00:08:50,350
and we tell him who
the new lead soloist is.

222
00:08:50,351 --> 00:08:53,333
Hopefully, it'll be me, 'cause
that's what Rachel wanted.

223
00:08:53,334 --> 00:08:55,351
Though I am uncomfortable doing
this behind Mr. Shue's back,

224
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:57,329
I am a director.

225
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,351
Therefore, I never pass up on
an opportunity to judge people.

226
00:08:59,352 --> 00:09:02,313
What song are we singing?

227
00:09:02,314 --> 00:09:04,278
What Rachel would sing,
if she were here.

228
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,360
The song of the summer,
"Call Me Maybe."

229
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:07,351
- Yes.
- Do you need time to prepare?

230
00:09:07,354 --> 00:09:09,367
I can sing any song, any time.

231
00:09:09,368 --> 00:09:11,346
Just press play, and get back.

So, Artie...
who's the new Rachel?

281
00:11:09,326 --> 00:11:11,321
So, how's Santana?

282
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:14,292
She's good; she's just really
busy with cheerleading practice

283
00:11:14,293 --> 00:11:16,338
and it's hard making out
over Skype.

284
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:18,338
You can't really scissor
a Webcam.

285
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:20,338
Here's an extra hot soy latte
for him

286
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:21,364
and a no-chocolate for her.

287
00:11:21,365 --> 00:11:23,309
Yes.

288
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,321
I can't wait till Friday.

289
00:11:25,322 --> 00:11:26,333
Why?

290
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:27,362
Glee Club auditions.

291
00:11:27,363 --> 00:11:28,343
That sounds like fun.

292
00:11:28,344 --> 00:11:30,329
Pretty nice.

293
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,338
Is it depressing
that I'm more excited about it

294
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:33,326
than either of you?

295
00:11:33,327 --> 00:11:34,355
- Yeah.
- No, not at all.

296
00:11:34,358 --> 00:11:36,271
Just a little bit.

297
00:11:36,272 --> 00:11:38,334
- No, it's...
- Excuse me. Garcon?

298
00:11:42,314 --> 00:11:44,342
My ice latte's too cold.

299
00:11:44,343 --> 00:11:46,304
It's an iced latte.

300
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:47,318
It's an iced latte
that's too cold.

301
00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:51,275
I'm gonna need you
to make me a new one.

302
00:11:51,276 --> 00:11:54,280
- Hello?
- Hey, Kurt, you got to refill the biscotti

303
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:55,301
Barrel every 15 minutes.

304
00:11:55,302 --> 00:11:57,310
Coming.

305
00:11:58,347 --> 00:12:01,297
I'll be right back
with your latte.

306
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,351
- Uh, Miss July?
- Yeah?

307
00:12:04,354 --> 00:12:07,329
I, uh, I don't know how to tell

308
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,325
you this, but I can't be
your TA this year.

309
00:12:10,326 --> 00:12:12,297
I start <i>Wicked
</i>rehearsals tomorrow.

310
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,295
I'm just playing
a flying monkey, but still...

311
00:12:14,296 --> 00:12:16,299
Oh, stop it. Does it matter?
It's your first Broadway show.

312
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,339
You'll never forget it.

313
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,275
I was 17, I was a dancing spoon.

314
00:12:20,276 --> 00:12:22,318
Well, the casting director
said it's the recommendation

315
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:25,275
you gave me that really
put me over the top,

316
00:12:25,276 --> 00:12:27,313
so thank you for
everything. Oh!

317
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:29,275
I'm so proud of you, Benjie.

318
00:12:29,276 --> 00:12:30,322
Thank you. I should go.

319
00:12:30,323 --> 00:12:32,355
I have to get fitted
for my monkey legs.

320
00:12:47,326 --> 00:12:50,313
You had enough time,
so who is it?

321
00:12:50,314 --> 00:12:51,322
You can't rush
the casting process.

322
00:12:51,323 --> 00:12:53,321
My genius needs
it's dream time.

323
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:55,329
You guys
are the Glee Club, right?

324
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,354
Hi. I'm gonna try out.

325
00:12:57,355 --> 00:13:00,283
I'm a sophomore.
My name is Marley.

326
00:13:00,284 --> 00:13:03,280
Okay, well, lots of competition,
so good luck to you.

327
00:13:07,326 --> 00:13:09,270
Unique offers her greetings
and salutations.

328
00:13:09,271 --> 00:13:11,274
Wade, you can't wear
that makeup and stuff in here.

329
00:13:11,275 --> 00:13:13,316
You have to understand
how this stuff works.
It's like <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

330
00:13:13,317 --> 00:13:16,312
Yeah, the peace between us
and the truly popular kids
is weak... winter is coming.

331
00:13:16,313 --> 00:13:18,308
It's not gonna take much
for us to get smacked down
to the bottom again.

332
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:20,368
Maybe you should just save
Unique for performances

333
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:23,271
and be Wade
the rest of the time, hmm?

334
00:13:23,272 --> 00:13:27,318
All right...
I'll go take off my face.

335
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,368
- Hey, glee people.
- Hey, Kitty.

336
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:34,351
Hey, you guys see
the new lunch lady?

337
00:13:34,352 --> 00:13:37,333
She's so fat, they took a
picture of her last Christmas.

338
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:39,359
Still printing.

339
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,271
Hey, she has to wear a watch
on both wrists

340
00:13:42,272 --> 00:13:44,310
because she covers
two time zones.

341
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:47,291
Maybe she has,
like, a medical condition

342
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:49,339
or she swallowed somebody
with a medical condition.

343
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:52,670
Right, Artie?

344
00:13:59,678 --> 00:14:01,648
When she sits around the house,

345
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:02,666
she really sits around
the house.

346
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:03,685
Attaboy.

347
00:14:03,686 --> 00:14:05,686
Attaboy!

348
00:14:10,624 --> 00:14:11,703
Hey, you ready to go?

349
00:14:11,704 --> 00:14:14,623
Hey. I thought that
you could wear this

350
00:14:14,624 --> 00:14:17,644
to your glee audition.

351
00:14:17,645 --> 00:14:19,648
Well, even if they think
it's secondhand,

352
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:23,648
the tag will say
high-class secondhand.

353
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:25,665
It's high school;
It's all about being special.

354
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,677
But... the right kind
of special,

355
00:14:28,678 --> 00:14:32,652
not Goodwill clothes,

356
00:14:32,653 --> 00:14:34,628
daughter-of-the-lunch-
lady special.

357
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:38,682
You really think
I have a chance

358
00:14:38,683 --> 00:14:40,665
of getting into Glee Club?

359
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,695
You have magic
in your throat, Marley.

360
00:14:44,641 --> 00:14:45,682
It's time to share it
with the world.

361
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:50,640
I'm going to drive the car
a couple blocks away,

362
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:53,698
and I will wait for you there.

363
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:55,639
I don't want
to risk anyone seeing you

364
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,670
get in the car with me.

365
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:04,636
Mm-wah!

366
00:15:05,653 --> 00:15:08,640
God almighty, Schwimmer,

367
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:09,720
possible you're getting worse?

368
00:15:09,721 --> 00:15:11,652
I've been practicing a lot.

369
00:15:11,653 --> 00:15:13,669
I've just had a little bit
of a rough week.

370
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,631
Aw, you tired? You lonely?

371
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:17,685
You homesick?

372
00:15:17,686 --> 00:15:20,652
Well, you better decide how
badly you want it

373
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:21,699
'cause this school is filled
with people

374
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,665
who will do whatever necessary
to make it in this business.

375
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:25,674
Why are you picking on me?

376
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,699
I'm not! I'm motivating you!

377
00:15:30,674 --> 00:15:32,665
What's your problem now?

378
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,666
There's just alcohol
on your breath.

379
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:40,666
It's Listerine.

380
00:15:41,686 --> 00:15:44,711
Let me tell you something.

381
00:15:44,712 --> 00:15:48,665

a wide-eyed ingenue anymore,

382
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,632

537
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:01,442
Thank you. Thank you.

538
00:26:01,443 --> 00:26:03,371
Wow.

539
00:26:03,372 --> 00:26:04,420
Now, that's what I call
star quality.

540
00:26:04,421 --> 00:26:05,427
What do you guys think?

541
00:26:05,428 --> 00:26:07,393
- Ten.
- It was good.

542
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:24,426
What's this?

543
00:27:24,427 --> 00:27:26,434
I'm organizing
all the sheet music.

544
00:27:26,435 --> 00:27:28,421
Artie, go around it,
not over it.

545
00:27:28,422 --> 00:27:29,446
Thanks, Dottie.
You're dismissed for the day.

546
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:31,425
This is for you...
and no, it's not a bribe,

547
00:27:31,426 --> 00:27:33,410
because we all know
Rachel told me herself

548
00:27:33,411 --> 00:27:35,367
that I'm the new Rachel.

549
00:27:35,368 --> 00:27:36,448
MVP in the house.

550
00:27:36,449 --> 00:27:39,359
Bro, I thought we agreed you'd
only wear that stuff onstage.

551
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,408
What's wrong with you guys?

552
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,398
This club is about diversity
and acceptance.

553
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,426
Or at least it used to be.

554
00:27:44,427 --> 00:27:46,406
And another thing...
since when did everyone

555
00:27:46,407 --> 00:27:48,426
become so obsessed with
who's the biggest star?

556
00:27:48,427 --> 00:27:50,367
Since day one... you and Rachel

557
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:51,410
fought over solos
for three years.

558
00:27:51,411 --> 00:27:54,359
No more stalling, Artie.

559
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,360
Who's the new Rachel?

560
00:27:56,368 --> 00:27:57,421
Tell us.

561
00:27:57,422 --> 00:28:00,447
After meticulous deliberation
and an online poll,

562
00:28:00,448 --> 00:28:03,413
the new Rachel
is... Blaine.

563
00:28:03,414 --> 00:28:06,410
- How?
- Brittany, you were a close second.

564
00:28:06,413 --> 00:28:08,435
- I came in third?
- Let's not worry about third or fourth place.

565
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,414
And we don't need
to talk about this, either.

566
00:28:10,415 --> 00:28:12,434
Why do you hate
strong black women for?

567
00:28:12,435 --> 00:28:14,375
Guys, this young lady
gave hands-down

568
00:28:14,376 --> 00:28:16,362
one of the best auditions
I have ever seen.

569
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:18,863
Let's give it up for our
newest member, Marley Rose.

570
00:28:19,443 --> 00:28:23,413
Marley, on behalf of all
of New Directions!, welcome.

571
00:28:23,414 --> 00:28:24,426
Thank you.

572
00:28:24,427 --> 00:28:26,388
I'm really excited to be here.

573
00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:28,409
I really like your sweater.
Where'd you get it?

574
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:29,447
Oh. Thanks.

575
00:28:29,448 --> 00:28:32,380
Um, J.Crew.

576
00:28:32,381 --> 00:28:33,421
Really?

577
00:28:33,422 --> 00:28:34,443
<i>The only new member</i>

578
00:28:34,444 --> 00:28:36,426
out of all those people?

579
00:28:36,427 --> 00:28:38,421
It wasn't that many.

580
00:28:38,422 --> 00:28:41,401
Okay, it was awesome!

581
00:28:41,402 --> 00:28:43,447
Hearing them cheer for me,
accept me.

582
00:28:43,448 --> 00:28:45,412
And that Rachel Berry
everybody talks about

583
00:28:45,413 --> 00:28:47,400
rode that glee club train
right to Broadway.

584
00:28:47,401 --> 00:28:49,370
Well, I don't want to be
on Broadway, though.

585
00:28:49,371 --> 00:28:50,446
I want to be a singer
on the radio.

586
00:28:50,447 --> 00:28:52,443
Well, then let the glee club
help you get there.

587
00:28:52,444 --> 00:28:54,430
For now, the important thing

588
00:28:54,431 --> 00:28:57,389
is you found someplace
you belong.

589
00:28:59,368 --> 00:29:00,431
There's one problem.

590
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,418
They were making fun of you.

591
00:29:07,406 --> 00:29:09,392
Well, they're teenagers.

592
00:29:09,393 --> 00:29:11,434
Just feels so weird
lying about you.

593
00:29:11,435 --> 00:29:13,384
You're my mom.

594
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:15,384
You remember what happened
at the last school?

595
00:29:15,385 --> 00:29:17,434
You didn't have any friends.

596
00:29:17,435 --> 00:29:19,388
I won't let that happen again.

597
00:29:19,389 --> 00:29:20,416
This is your shot to sit

598
00:29:20,417 --> 00:29:21,452
at the popular kids' table.

599
00:29:21,453 --> 00:29:23,427
Don't blow it.

600
00:29:27,406 --> 00:29:30,371
Of course, I think you
should be the lead soloist.

601
00:29:30,372 --> 00:29:32,371
But can I give you some advice?

602
00:29:32,372 --> 00:29:34,421
Even when Rachel was
her most controlling,

603
00:29:34,422 --> 00:29:37,405
she still made sure
everyone felt included.

604
00:29:37,406 --> 00:29:40,392
Okay. You have a point.

605
00:29:40,393 --> 00:29:42,363
Can I give you some advice?

606
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:45,413
You can't be here
anymore, Kurt.

607
00:29:45,414 --> 00:29:48,392
I get it. I know.
I'm pathetic.

608
00:29:48,393 --> 00:29:50,381
No, no, you're...
you're not pathetic.

609
00:29:50,382 --> 00:29:52,451
It's just that you're...
you're stuck.

610
00:29:52,452 --> 00:29:55,426
You don't belong here anymore.
You belong in New York.

611
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:57,421
And I'm reapplying for NYADA.

612
00:29:57,422 --> 00:29:59,405
But I can't just
go to New York.

613
00:29:59,406 --> 00:30:01,401
You don't need NYADA.

614
00:30:01,402 --> 00:30:03,366
And believe me,
I don't want to see you go,

615
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:04,439
but I just can't stand
to see you stay here.

616
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,367
It's killing you.

617
00:30:06,368 --> 00:30:07,422
And that's killing me.

618
00:30:07,423 --> 00:30:09,401
What about us?

619
00:30:09,402 --> 00:30:11,417
In a year,
I'll be there, too, but...

620
00:30:11,418 --> 00:30:14,421
right now is your time.

621
00:30:14,422 --> 00:30:15,443

Brittany, I'm sorry, but I won
fair and square. You can't

656
00:32:33,436 --> 00:32:36,406
- just decide not to sing anymore. We all need your voice.
- I had a song

657
00:32:36,407 --> 00:32:38,362
In my heart, Blaine Warbler,
and you killed it.

658
00:32:38,363 --> 00:32:39,408
Now I have a dead
song in my heart,

659
00:32:39,409 --> 00:32:41,389
and pretty soon, the corpse
of my dead heart song

660
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:43,372
- is going to start to smell.
- Okay, guys.

661
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:45,397
Since we can't do
a popularity homecoming float

662
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:48,401
with all white people, I say
I think we should do one

663
00:32:48,402 --> 00:32:50,443
- with all white chrysanthemums.
- That's a good idea.

664
00:32:50,446 --> 00:32:53,372
We need a float,
why don't we all just ride her?

665
00:32:54,385 --> 00:32:56,392
Look at her boobs.

666
00:32:56,393 --> 00:32:58,397
It's like two grocery bags
full of soup.

667
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:00,439
- That's really mean.
- Excuse me?

668
00:33:00,442 --> 00:33:02,392
You don't know her.

669
00:33:02,393 --> 00:33:03,416
You don't know
what her life is like.

670
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:04,448
So? Why do you care?

671
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,431
Because she's my mom.

672
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:13,377
I thought you guys
were different.

673
00:33:21,406 --> 00:33:24,384
That your boyfriend?

674
00:33:24,385 --> 00:33:25,405
Hey.

675
00:33:25,406 --> 00:33:26,431
Yeah, this is Finn.

676
00:33:26,432 --> 00:33:28,388
He's in the Army, so we really

677
00:33:28,389 --> 00:33:29,435
haven't been
talking much lately.

678
00:33:29,436 --> 00:33:33,384
I had a girlfriend back home
when I first started NYADA.

679
00:33:33,385 --> 00:33:36,363
Yeah, we lasted six weeks.

680
00:33:36,364 --> 00:33:37,412
No, that's not
gonna happen to us.

681
00:33:37,413 --> 00:33:39,391
I'm not gonna turn
my back on him.

682
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:40,422
Oh, nobody said you should.

683
00:33:40,423 --> 00:33:43,409
Anyway, I came to tell you

684
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:46,371
that you killed it
in Tibideaux's class.

685
00:33:46,372 --> 00:33:47,384
Nice job.

686
00:33:47,385 --> 00:33:48,384
Thank you.

687
00:33:48,385 --> 00:33:49,435
You know, it's just,

688
00:33:49,436 --> 00:33:51,435
other than when I was
singing that song,

689
00:33:51,436 --> 00:33:57,421
I've just really never felt as
amazingly wrong as I do here.

690
00:33:57,422 --> 00:34:00,392
Just all alone.

691
00:34:00,393 --> 00:34:03,398
Kind of feel like I'm just
gonna throw up all the time.

692
00:34:04,439 --> 00:34:06,371
Well, it's just because

693
00:34:06,372 --> 00:34:07,398
you're becoming
a different person.

694
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:09,388
That's why you came
to New York.

695
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:13,405
To be that new
and improved girl.

696
00:34:13,406 --> 00:34:15,376
Here, let me see your phone.

697
00:34:15,377 --> 00:34:16,427
We're gonna take a picture.

698
00:34:20,393 --> 00:34:22,376
Let me see.

699
00:34:22,377 --> 00:34:23,447
You look good.

700
00:34:23,448 --> 00:34:26,376
Don't fight the new you.

701
00:34:26,377 --> 00:34:29,376
Because from what I've seen,

702
00:34:29,377 --> 00:34:32,388
she is gonna kick
some serious tail.

703
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:36,372
And start adding
new memories to the old ones.

704
00:34:38,448 --> 00:34:40,398
Walk you to class?

705
00:34:43,435 --> 00:34:44,448
What's the problem, people?

706
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,388
You've been here a week.

707
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:47,427
You should be dancing at, like,

708
00:34:47,428 --> 00:34:50,392
<i>Black Swan </i>levels
of psychosis right now.

709
00:34:50,393 --> 00:34:52,401
You, Miss Schwimmer.

710
00:34:52,402 --> 00:34:54,406
Show me your piqué.

711
00:34:56,406 --> 00:34:58,392
Okay, give me another one.

712
00:34:58,393 --> 00:35:00,393
Center yourself this time.

713
00:35:03,443 --> 00:35:05,455
Better, slightly.

714
00:35:05,456 --> 00:35:08,371
You gonna roll your
eyes at me now?

715
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:10,363
No.

716
00:35:10,364 --> 00:35:11,402
And I'm gonna
keep getting better

717
00:35:11,403 --> 00:35:14,392
till I'm the best
you've ever seen.

718
00:35:14,393 --> 00:35:16,371
Oh, you're mouthy.

719
00:35:16,372 --> 00:35:17,443
And you got guts.

720
00:35:17,444 --> 00:35:19,417
Good, I like it.

721
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:22,413
I like that spirit
in my students.

722
00:35:22,414 --> 00:35:24,442
'Cause it'll make
it more fun for me

723
00:35:24,443 --> 00:35:28,393
when I'm making your every
waking moment a hell on earth.

724
00:35:32,945 --> 00:35:34,020
So boring.

725
00:35:39,567 --> 00:35:42,395
All right.

726
00:35:42,399 --> 00:35:43,798
As soon as you find
a place to live,

727
00:35:43,828 --> 00:35:45,809
I'll ship you the
rest of your stuff.

728
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,178
And you'll get enough cash
from selling your car

729
00:35:47,204 --> 00:35:50,156
to get you through at least
two weeks in a motel.

730
00:35:50,157 --> 00:35:53,156
And the emergency credit
card, which is only for what?

731
00:35:53,157 --> 00:35:55,156
Emergencies.
Dad, this is silly.

732
00:35:55,157 --> 00:35:57,143
I don't have to be in New York
to reapply for NYADA.

733
00:35:57,144 --> 00:35:58,224
So I can find a job
that pays me the same amount

734
00:35:58,225 --> 00:36:01,148
as Lima Bean, but pay
ten times more in rent?

735
00:36:01,149 --> 00:36:03,156
Yeah, because it's
an adventure.

736
00:36:03,157 --> 00:36:06,202
Look, all great artists need a
little struggle in their lives.

737
00:36:06,203 --> 00:36:08,166
Didn't you tell me
that Julia Roberts

738
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:10,181
sold shoes in New York
before she made it?

739
00:36:10,182 --> 00:36:13,182
Good enough for Pretty Woman,
good enough for Kurt Hummel.

740
00:36:16,149 --> 00:36:17,156
Scared?

741
00:36:17,157 --> 00:36:18,210
Terrified.

742
00:36:18,211 --> 00:36:21,181
New York is gonna be a
breeze compared to Lima.

743
00:36:21,182 --> 00:36:23,182
Think about all the crap
you've been putting up with

744
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:25,148
the last couple years.

745
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:27,224
You know the difference between
this place and New York?

746
00:36:27,225 --> 00:36:29,148
Decent bagels?

747
00:36:29,149 --> 00:36:31,145
New York is filled
with people like you.

748
00:36:31,146 --> 00:36:34,185
People who aren't
afraid to be different.

749
00:36:34,186 --> 00:36:37,178
You're gonna feel
at home there.

750
00:36:39,178 --> 00:36:41,151
If you're not scared,
just means you're not

751
00:36:41,152 --> 00:36:42,218
sticking out your
neck far enough.

752
00:36:42,219 --> 00:36:44,168
You truly are
the world's greatest dad.

753
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:46,143
I know. It's written
on the coffee mug

754
00:36:46,144 --> 00:36:47,199
you got me for Father's Day.

755
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,131
Now, get out of here.

756
00:36:49,132 --> 00:36:50,211
You're gonna miss your flight.

757
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:00,223
I'm gonna miss you, Dad.

758
00:37:00,224 --> 00:37:03,145
You can always come back.

759
00:37:08,216 --> 00:37:10,207
But you won't.

760
00:37:13,211 --> 00:37:16,127
I love you.

761
00:37:16,128 --> 00:37:18,190
I love you, too, Kurt.

762
00:37:37,182 --> 00:37:39,148
Hey, Marley, um, just wanted

763
00:37:39,149 --> 00:37:41,224
to apologize for all of us
and beg you not to quit.

764
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:44,165
Look, I get you.

765
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:46,199
Like, for instance, I know that
that sweater is from Walmart

766
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,140
- and your mom sewed the J.Crew label into it.
- How do you know that?

767
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:51,136
Because my mom used to do
the same thing for me.

768
00:37:51,137 --> 00:37:53,148
The best thing about Glee Club

769
00:37:53,149 --> 00:37:54,203
is it's not about labels.

770
00:37:54,204 --> 00:37:56,203
If you can sing,
if you can dance,

771
00:37:56,204 --> 00:37:58,223
you belong.

772
00:37:58,224 --> 00:37:59,224
And, dude, you can sing.

773
00:37:59,225 --> 00:38:02,127
I don't know.
You say that,

774
00:38:02,128 --> 00:38:04,185
but the way you were
making fun of my mom,

775
00:38:04,186 --> 00:38:06,185
something doesn't feel right.

776
00:38:06,186 --> 00:38:08,210
We came to apologize.

777
00:38:08,211 --> 00:38:10,127
I think being popular

778
00:38:10,128 --> 00:38:11,134
felt a little too good,

779
00:38:11,135 --> 00:38:12,172
and we forgot ourselves.

780
00:38:12,173 --> 00:38:14,134
Well, I didn't.
I was always popular,

781
00:38:14,135 --> 00:38:16,147
but I do forget to wear
underwear sometimes, though.

782
00:38:16,148 --> 00:38:18,138
The best part about
Glee Club is that

783
00:38:18,139 --> 00:38:19,168
everyone gets to be a star.

784
00:38:19,169 --> 00:38:21,130
Which is why we're all
hoping that you could

785
00:38:21,131 --> 00:38:22,164
come to rehearsal with us
this afternoon

786
00:38:22,165 --> 00:38:23,201
and maybe sing lead vocal on

787
00:38:23,202 --> 00:38:25,172
one of the songs
we're working on.

788
00:38:25,173 --> 00:38:26,195
And if words
don't convince you,

789
00:38:26,196 --> 00:38:28,169
let the majesty and mystery

790
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,128
of Unique's <i>fabulousness
</i>be enough!

791
00:38:31,136 --> 00:38:32,173
I mean it.

792
00:38:32,174 --> 00:38:33,224
Glee Club's a special place.

793
00:38:33,225 --> 00:38:35,206
I mean, where else could I

794
00:38:35,207 --> 00:38:38,144
dress like this and be
welcomed with open arms?

795
00:38:38,145 --> 00:38:39,222
Okay, one last thing.

796
00:38:39,223 --> 00:38:41,203
I don't think I'm comfortable
sitting with

797
00:38:41,204 --> 00:38:44,139
that cheerleader
and those guys at lunch.

798
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,151
That won't be a problem.

799
00:38:45,152 --> 00:38:46,153
We could handle Gimpy

800
00:38:46,154 --> 00:38:48,131
and the Tarantula Head

801
00:38:48,132 --> 00:38:50,126
and Richie Poor, because
you guys were national champs

802
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:51,186
like us, but our invitation

803
00:38:51,187 --> 00:38:53,189
was not extended
to pre-op Precious

804
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:55,182
based on the novel <i>Barf
</i>by Sapphire

805
00:38:55,183 --> 00:38:58,148
and Mike and Molly's daughter
as part of our crew.

806
00:38:58,149 --> 00:39:01,127
Well, I guess we're not
in your crew anymore.

807
00:39:01,128 --> 00:39:03,199
You know, I was kind of hoping
you'd say that.

808
00:39:06,161 --> 00:39:07,173
And with that,

809
00:39:07,174 --> 00:39:08,216
order is restored.

810
00:39:11,186 --> 00:39:13,198
Well, looks like
you guys have been

811
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:15,136
officially welcomed
to the Glee Club.

812
00:39:15,137 --> 00:39:17,210
Unique's eyes...
they are on <i>fire!</i>

813
00:39:17,211 --> 00:39:19,216
Let's get you guys cleaned up
and go to rehearsal.

814
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:28,211
You wanted to see me?

815
00:39:28,212 --> 00:39:29,223
Yes, I wanted

816
00:39:29,224 --> 00:39:31,195
to talk to you
about your audition.

817
00:39:31,196 --> 00:39:34,169
Do you have any idea
how hard I worked on that song?

818
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,169
I was up for three nights
getting it right,

819
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:38,126
and you didn't even
let me finish.

820
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:39,224
Glee Club performs
in front of hundreds of people.

821
00:39:39,225 --> 00:39:41,165
Some of them might boo you.

822
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:43,145
You gonna throw
a mic stand at them?

823
00:39:43,146 --> 00:39:44,148
So I'm angry.

824
00:39:44,149 --> 00:39:45,193
I got a right to be.

825
00:39:45,194 --> 00:39:46,216
You don't know me.

826
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,135
You don't know my life.

827
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:49,149
I know your brother, Jake.

828
00:39:50,132 --> 00:39:50,220
Puckerman.

829
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,219
Half-brother.

830
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,131
Our dad's like an NBA player.

831
00:39:54,132 --> 00:39:55,186
There could be
50 other Puckermans

832
00:39:55,187 --> 00:39:57,139
running around Ohio.

833
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,126
No one ever mentioned
anything about having a brother.

834
00:39:59,127 --> 00:40:00,153
He doesn't know.

835
00:40:00,154 --> 00:40:01,223
I get it.

836
00:40:01,224 --> 00:40:03,180
Now that you know
I'm related to your boy,

837
00:40:03,181 --> 00:40:04,224
I'm good enough
for your stupid club?

838
00:40:04,225 --> 00:40:08,131
No. When I saw you
were related to him,

839
00:40:08,132 --> 00:40:11,148
I realized how much good
Glee Club did him.

840
00:40:11,149 --> 00:40:13,160
Made me want to take
a chance on you.

841
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:16,139
But you've got to get
that chip off your shoulder.

842
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,220
And I interrupted
your audition because I knew

843
00:40:17,221 --> 00:40:21,215
after the first verse
that I wanted you in this club.

844
00:40:21,216 --> 00:40:23,152
You're really good, Jake.

845
00:40:23,153 --> 00:40:25,210
You think I'm good?

846
00:40:25,211 --> 00:40:26,219
Yeah.

847
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:29,160
No.

848
00:40:29,161 --> 00:40:31,131
I'm not changing.

849
00:40:31,132 --> 00:40:32,218
I like this chip on my shoulder

850
00:40:32,219 --> 00:40:34,203
and I'm not losing it
to sing for you.

851
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:39,140
