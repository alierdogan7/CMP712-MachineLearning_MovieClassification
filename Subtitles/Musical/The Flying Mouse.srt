l want to fly.

22
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:15,335
Oh, a mouse
was never meant to fly.

23
00:04:15,378 --> 00:04:17,642
Think carefully! Beware!

Well, if wings
are what you wish...

A mouse?!
Ha ha ha ha ha!

30
00:06:53,736 --> 00:06:57,433
No mouse can fly.
They ain't got wings.

31
00:06:57,473 --> 00:07:00,442
So if you ain't a bat--
Ha ha ha ha ha!

32
00:07:00,476 --> 00:07:02,444
You're nothing.
Think of that.

A mouse? Ha ha!

Come, come, my little friend.
