00:01:12,354 --> 00:01:15,856
EVEN SO IT WAS HER BATHING
SUIT THAT MADE HER FAMOUS,

10
00:01:15,857 --> 00:01:20,857
IT WAS ALMOST HEAVEN-SENT.

MANY TIMES WHEN IT WAS
DRYING ON THE LINE

12
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:31,869

AND LAST WEEK WHEN I
OPENED THE LAUNDRY PARCEL

37
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:53,654
THERE WAS A SCORCH MARK
ON ONE OF THE SHEETS.

38
00:02:53,655 --> 00:02:54,655

LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.

177
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:09,670
ABOUT ALL I'VE GOT LEFT IS
A SENSE OF HUMOR AND A WASHTUB.

178
00:08:09,671 --> 00:08:13,173
WELL, AT LEAST THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.

179
00:08:13,174 --> 00:08:15,275
HEAD FULL OF GOOD THOUGHTS,
BELLY FULL OF GRUB,

180
00:08:15,276 --> 00:08:16,777
MONEY IN YOUR POCKET,

181
00:08:16,778 --> 00:08:21,778
WHEN THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.

182
00:08:21,783 --> 00:08:26,286
SWEET AS HONEYSUCKLE
ON THE VINE, MA.

183
00:08:26,287 --> 00:08:28,288
Together:
YOUR NAILS WON'T BREAK
AND YOUR TOES WON'T STUB,

184
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:29,790
YOU NEVER GET A FEVER

185
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:34,791
WHEN THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.

186
00:08:34,796 --> 00:08:36,797
IF YOU LOOK
TO THE GOOD SIDE,

187
00:08:36,798 --> 00:08:39,299
FALLING DOWN'S A FREE RIDE

188
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,303
SLIPPING AND A-SLIDING
IN THE MUD.

189
00:08:43,304 --> 00:08:45,305
IF YOUR BACK IS HURTIN'

190
00:08:45,306 --> 00:08:47,307
I CAN SAY FOR CERTAIN

191
00:08:47,308 --> 00:08:52,308
I'LL BE THERE TO TREAT YOU
TO A SOOTHING BACK RUB.

192
00:08:54,315 --> 00:08:59,315
Emmet:
WHEN THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.

193
00:09:03,324 --> 00:09:04,324
LUNCH WITH
THE UPPER CRUST,

194
00:09:04,325 --> 00:09:05,325
DINNER AT THE CLUB,

195
00:09:05,326 --> 00:09:06,827
HIGH ON THE HOG

196
00:09:06,828 --> 00:09:11,828
WHEN THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.

197
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,834
WATERMELON GARDEN,
BERRIES ON THE SHRUB,

198
00:09:13,835 --> 00:09:15,335
COOKIES IN THE KITCHEN

199
00:09:15,336 --> 00:09:20,336
WHEN THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.

200
00:09:21,342 --> 00:09:22,342
HI, EMMET.

201
00:09:22,343 --> 00:09:24,344

202
00:09:24,345 --> 00:09:26,847
( Chuckling )
GOOD CATCH, WENDELL!

203
00:09:26,848 --> 00:09:29,850

204
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:32,352
( Splash! )

205
00:09:32,353 --> 00:09:37,353
I'LL BE THERE TO TREAT YOU
TO A SOOTHING BACK RUB.

206
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:43,860
WHEN THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.

207
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:47,868
THERE GO TWO OF THE NICEST FOLK
ON THE RIVER.

208
00:09:47,869 --> 00:09:49,870
IF YOU LOOK
TO THE GOOD SIDE,

209
00:09:49,871 --> 00:09:52,372
FALLING DOWN'S A FREE RIDE

210
00:09:52,373 --> 00:09:55,876
SLIPPING AND A-SLIDING
IN THE MUD.

211
00:09:55,877 --> 00:09:57,878
THOUGH IT TWISTS
AND CONTORTS YOU,

212
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:00,380
THAT BARREL SUPPORTS YOU.

213
00:10:00,381 --> 00:10:02,382
YOU CAN FEED
AND CLOTHE YOURSELF

214
00:10:02,383 --> 00:10:06,887
WITH A RUB-A-DUB-DUB

215
00:10:06,888 --> 00:10:11,888
WHEN THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.

216
00:10:12,393 --> 00:10:16,396
AIN'T NO HOLE
IN THE WASHTUB.

217
00:10:16,397 --> 00:10:21,397
AIN'T NO HOLE
IN THE WASHTUB.

218
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:32,909
( Music )

219
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:42,619
( Music Continues )

220
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:52,629
PHEW! BOY,

221
00:10:53,134 --> 00:10:58,134
WOW! RIVER'S FROZEN UP SOLID.

222
00:11:01,643 --> 00:11:04,144

00:11:15,857 --> 00:11:19,359
YEAH, BUT...
I DON'T HAVE ANY TOOLS.

230
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:19,860

233
00:11:22,864 --> 00:11:27,367
HEY! IF YOU COULD HELP,
MAYBE WE COULD SPLIT THE MONEY.

234
00:11:27,368 --> 00:11:28,468

00:13:45,406 --> 00:13:47,908

WHAT WOULD I PLAY?

313
00:13:59,721 --> 00:14:00,220
WHAT ELSE?

314
00:14:00,722 --> 00:14:02,723
YOU GET TO PLAY
WASHTUB BASS.

315
00:14:02,724 --> 00:14:04,224
WHY ME?

316
00:14:04,225 --> 00:14:06,026
WELL, BECAUSE YOUR
MA'S GOT THE WASHTUB!

317
00:14:06,027 --> 00:14:07,027
OH, NO!

318
00:14:07,028 --> 00:14:08,028

WHY NOT, EMMET?

323
00:14:13,735 --> 00:14:16,837
BECAUSE, TO MAKE
A WASHTUB BASS,

324
00:14:16,838 --> 00:14:21,541
YOU HAVE TO PUT
A HOLE IN THE WASHTUB!!

325
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:24,544
HMM...I DON'T EVEN HAVE
A PROPER COSTUME.

326
00:14:24,545 --> 00:14:28,548
HETTY, I CAN'T POSSIBLY
ENTER THAT CONTEST!

327
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:30,550
YOU'RE RIGHT, ALICE.

328
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:33,053
FORGET THE WHOLE THING.

329
00:14:33,054 --> 00:14:38,054
HETTY MUSKRAT, YOU STOP TRYING
TO SWEET-TALK ME INTO THIS!

330
00:14:40,561 --> 00:14:43,563
THIS IS THE FENCE
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO MEND?

331
00:14:43,564 --> 00:14:45,565
WELL...

332
00:14:45,566 --> 00:14:46,566
YEAH.

333
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:49,069
THAT'S NOT REPAIRING,
THAT'S REBUILDING.

334
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:52,072
DON'T JUST
STAND AROUND, BOYS.

335
00:14:52,073 --> 00:14:57,073
YA GOT WORK TO DO.

336
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:03,079
( Banjo )

337
00:15:04,585 --> 00:15:06,586
( Thinking )
JUST ONCE I'D LIKE TO GIVE

338
00:15:06,587 --> 00:15:10,590
A FINE STORE-BOUGHT PRESENT
TO EMMET FOR CHRISTMAS.

339
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:14,594
AND WITH $50...

340
00:15:14,595 --> 00:15:17,097
( Tap! Tap! Tap... )

341
00:15:17,098 --> 00:15:19,599
( Thinking )
I'VE NEVER GIVEN MA
A NICE CHRISTMAS PRESENT.

342
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,101
NEVER GAVE ONE TO PA, EITHER...

343
00:15:21,102 --> 00:15:25,105
AND...NOW IT'S TOO LATE.

344
00:15:25,106 --> 00:15:30,106
HARVEY SAYS $50
SPLIT FOUR WAYS IS $12.50.

345
00:15:30,611 --> 00:15:35,115
LOTTA MONEY.

346
00:15:35,116 --> 00:15:37,617
THAT GUITAR WE SAW IN TOWN...

347
00:15:37,618 --> 00:15:41,121
THE ONE WITH
THE MOTHER-OF-PEARL INLAYS...

348
00:15:41,122 --> 00:15:45,125
EMMET REALLYWANTS IT.

349
00:15:45,126 --> 00:15:48,628
BUT...$40!

350
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:52,632
I CAN'T BUY A PIANO
FOR $12.50 ANYWAY...

351
00:15:52,633 --> 00:15:57,633
BUT YOU COULDPUT
A DOWN PAYMENT ON A USED ONE.

352
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,642
BUT IF I DO ENTER,
I GOTTA HAVE A COSTUME.

353
00:16:02,643 --> 00:16:06,646
AND TO BUY A COSTUME,
I'D HAVE TO HOCK SOMETHING.

354
00:16:06,647 --> 00:16:07,647
HMM...

355
00:16:07,648 --> 00:16:10,150
NOTHING LEFT TO HOCK.

356
00:16:10,151 --> 00:16:14,154
OF COURSE, THERE'S
PA'S OLD TOOL CHEST.

357
00:16:14,155 --> 00:16:17,657

A GOOD JUG-BAND...

359
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:24,660

360
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:31,667

LIKE THAT GUITAR.

361

HAVE THE BRANCH.

372

EVERY YEAR HE'D GO OUT VOWING

376
00:17:16,717 --> 00:17:20,720

AREALWHOLE CHRISTMAS TREE.

377
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:22,722
HA! BUT HE NEVER HAD
THE HEART TO DO IT.

378
00:17:22,723 --> 00:17:24,524
AND EVERY YEAR HE'D SAY...

379
00:17:24,525 --> 00:17:27,527
( Big, Deep Voice )
"BECAUSE I DIDN'T CUT IT DOWN,"

380
00:17:27,528 --> 00:17:32,528
"THE REST OF THAT TREE WILL
STILL BE ALIVE IN 100 YEARS."
