Here

21
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Here
Our dance group is a success

22
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,500
Ultimately
Get ready, let's sing

23
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Ultimately
The few who dare to show

24
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,000
Do not be ashamed
To confess (confess)

25
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,000
You came to look at

26
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,500
The coolest part

27
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Our frontal nudity...

28
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,827
Here
For us all it's magic number

29
00:04:41,987 --> 00:04:47,000
Here
There is also space for comic and tragic

30
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,000
For us?
There is no guilt or punishment has

31
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,000
For us?
Bare stage is the definition

32
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:58,000
But we do want, arguing
(Yes, arguing)

33
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,000
You'll like it
Oh, go...

34
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:08,087
When natural
This is our full nudity

35
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:12,995
Mom always wanted me to be the largest

36
00:05:13,495 --> 00:05:17,995
Always gave me all the good and best

37
00:05:18,995 --> 00:05:23,495
If you saw me today so
As a dummy

38
00:05:23,995 --> 00:05:26,495
What would the years of classical and jazz

39
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:31,995
And six years of ballet?

40
00:05:32,995 --> 00:05:33,995
Well ..

41
00:05:34,045 --> 00:05:38,995
I will not forget everything I learned

42
00:05:38,873 --> 00:05:47,047
But as is so good, Mom, get naked here!

43
00:05:47,828 --> 00:05:52,495
You shuffle your look with lustful

44
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:58,995
Because without the towel private is public

45
00:05:59,495 --> 00:06:02,705
Jerry... Sorry...
Sorry!

46
00:06:02,705 --> 00:06:05,268
Cellular... I knew...
phone!

47
00:06:09,206 --> 00:06:10,223
Let me answer for you...

48
00:06:11,215 --> 00:06:13,019
Hello?

49
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:15,408
Not here Ps is the
Who speaks?

50
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:18,556
Sal's mother ..

51
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:22,514
He can now talk now.
He will already be naked!

52
00:06:23,922 --> 00:06:26,301
You've heard the warning before the show?

53
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:27,434
No, sorry!

54
00:06:27,434 --> 00:06:29,057
Well, what was told is that

55
00:06:29,057 --> 00:06:32,223
if your phone rings during the presentation,
you should get naked with us.

56
00:06:32,224 --> 00:06:34,485
So... Let...

57
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:57,995
Sorry, we reinstate your Ps
phone, now you are part of the show.

58
00:06:58,495 --> 00:07:00,995
So you can dance and sing?
For we can call another person.

59
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:07,272
Alright! Who wants to see
Sal singing and dancing naked?

60
00:07:12,535 --> 00:07:18,604
Now, when the count of 3 will start
the first presentation of Salt nuzinho.

61
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,991
Ready?
Salt Ready?

62
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:27,099
A. .. Two...
Three!

63
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,592
Well, where were we?

64
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:56,084
You shuffle your look with lustful

65
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:59,995
Because without the towel private is public

66
00:08:00,995 --> 00:08:03,995
You can be gay, straight or bi

67
00:08:04,495 --> 00:08:06,995
There is only one reason for coming here

68
00:08:07,495 --> 00:08:12,995
In front, behind
In the four cardinal points

69
00:08:13,495 --> 00:08:17,995
Let us proclaim (gritar!)
Thus the natural

70
00:08:18,495 --> 00:08:22,495
Like any mortal
The coolest part

71
00:08:25,495 --> 00:08:32,192
I get so exposed
What remains to show?

72
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:38,973
The doors closed
There is nothing to hide

73
00:08:38,973 --> 00:08:42,498
I took off my armor

74
00:08:42,498 --> 00:08:45,722
I looked closely

75
00:08:45,722 --> 00:08:55,170
And I saw that being naked is more
Only to be discovered

76
00:08:55,205 --> 00:09:01,742
Then I realized
That nudity is more than an order

77
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:07,995
So, I know I want to undress me
Of shame in me.

78
00:09:10,995 --> 00:09:13,995
The truth I'll get

79
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,995
Not knowing where I'm going

80
00:09:17,495 --> 00:09:27,995
I look at my body
And try to see who I am

81
00:09:28,495 --> 00:09:34,095
Anyway, the drama is not our motto

82
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:40,036
Here is how the summer of Ipanema

83
00:09:40,036 --> 00:09:42,926
Here there is no Shakespeare or Moliere has

84
00:09:42,926 --> 00:09:45,778
Critics write what she wants

85
00:09:45,778 --> 00:09:51,616
I hear you moan
(Yes, you howl!)

86
00:09:51,616 --> 00:09:55,995
It is sensational
Thus the natural

87
00:09:57,114 --> 00:10:02,443
Like any mortal
The coolest part

88
00:10:02,443 --> 00:10:10,416
Our... Our... Our...
Our full nudity

89
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,992
Total!

90
00:10:22,296 --> 00:10:24,959
MY PROFESSION

91
00:10:25,946 --> 00:10:29,448
I told an acquaintance
I wanted to work

92
00:10:29,448 --> 00:10:33,607
And then he asked me
if i was exemplary

93
00:10:33,607 --> 00:10:37,431
In the house in order by
they work very nice

94
00:10:37,431 --> 00:10:40,103
I would think...

95
00:10:40,103 --> 00:10:45,030
But with an unusual requirement

96
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:48,703
Scrub the floor naked

97
00:10:49,573 --> 00:10:52,491
Vacuuming then

98
00:10:53,427 --> 00:10:57,267
Upturned butt

99
00:10:57,267 --> 00:11:01,204
Rinse with force clothing boss

100
00:11:01,204 --> 00:11:05,151
Muscles in shape
Here is my standard

101
00:11:05,151 --> 00:11:09,020
Is the house shine like the Taj Mahal

102
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,907
That being so nice
Without clothes, and the attention to me

103
00:11:12,907 --> 00:11:16,568
It is an endless fun
And I get a lot of money

104
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:20,114
I like more
of my profession

105
00:11:28,114 --> 00:11:31,114
Earlier rolls a climate

106
00:11:31,614 --> 00:11:34,929
And it just gets better

107
00:11:35,354 --> 00:11:38,814
If the mood is up there

108
00:11:38,814 --> 00:11:42,500
Laughing says he is a fan of Belchior

109
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,519
Go undressing
That saves you time

110
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:50,011
By joining the material to use

111
00:11:50,011 --> 00:11:54,058
Cloth, bucket, mop
And he's already feeling burning

112
00:11:54,058 --> 00:11:57,114
I have sex only if it is
A cat... and my card

113
00:11:57,614 --> 00:12:01,356
Says what the obligations
my profession

114
00:12:01,356 --> 00:12:02,877
League!
You seem strass!

115
00:12:04,993 --> 00:12:08,238
Following me like a cat

116
00:12:08,738 --> 00:12:12,512
I let him look more

117
00:12:12,512 --> 00:12:15,804
Singing and clean your picture

118
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,834
I use my natural gifts

119
00:12:19,834 --> 00:12:23,535
And in any case
It's kinda scary

120
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:27,325
It seems a performance,
but with a mop

121
00:12:27,325 --> 00:12:31,110
Already four in readiness
Clean every crack or go

122
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,998
I feel a satisfaction
And I can not stop

123
00:12:34,998 --> 00:12:38,238
The welfare and it is my
in my profession

124
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,482
I charge extra for dance...

125
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:50,643
But I give a discount if the ruffles...

126
00:12:53,258 --> 00:12:56,250
The neighbors love
when I clean the windows.

127
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:21,183
Smell of jasmine
I gave it my all

128
00:13:22,265 --> 00:13:25,265
My power is awesome,

129
00:13:25,765 --> 00:13:27,240
Finally!

130
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:30,265
Until I retire

131
00:13:30,765 --> 00:13:33,765
work with dedication

132
00:13:34,265 --> 00:13:38,265
I give myself with passion
to my profession

133
00:13:41,151 --> 00:13:42,195
But...

134
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:48,427
To finish the story
I will not claim victory

135
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:54,260
Because I do not really mind
for the gift of tidiness

136
00:13:54,260 --> 00:14:00,020
Well, pay attention
And it will give me reason

137
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:04,280
With all my heart
I make a confession

138
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:16,733
But that contradiction
My home is... just a mess!

139
00:14:18,632 --> 00:14:20,466
What a mess!

140
00:14:41,828 --> 00:14:45,119
HOOD TO SEDUCE

141
00:15:35,772 --> 00:15:40,876
At eight days the family has wanted to see me

142
00:15:41,612 --> 00:15:46,524
Came a man who had something
that glowed in his hand

143
00:15:47,588 --> 00:15:48,775
He then said:

144
00:15:48,775 --> 00:15:52,708
"Blessed is the fruit that was born"

145
00:15:53,176 --> 00:15:59,000
He spoke in a language beyond all understanding
"Baruchatah... I do not know that there "

146
00:16:00,485 --> 00:16:06,673
Everyone then realized it was there

147
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:11,554
Instrument worthy of wonder

148
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:19,265
Someone said: "Other"
Clinked crystals

149
00:16:20,586 --> 00:16:30,107
As if I had something unique
"Da da di di di di di di"

150
00:16:35,023 --> 00:16:39,887
The hood that seduces

151
00:16:39,922 --> 00:16:44,134
Everyone gathers around my penis

152
00:16:44,134 --> 00:16:51,399
To look at, contemplate

153
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:59,628
This organ is in the service of Venus

154
00:16:59,628 --> 00:17:06,518
They will smile, applaud
Everyone cheered as this masterpiece

155
00:17:06,518 --> 00:17:09,917
That eagerness, a Rodin
When up is sublime, is a sideshow

156
00:17:09,917 --> 00:17:13,687
Taking measures is so great
Hung Up is wonderful

157
00:17:13,687 --> 00:17:18,260
A thousand cheers is jus
Hood that seduces

158
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,919
"Mazel Tov"

159
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,787
I assumed that the tin-tin for me
would never-ending

160
00:17:25,787 --> 00:17:29,647
(I want more!)
A cut tight

161
00:17:29,647 --> 00:17:33,882
beard and saying:
"Do not ever expose"

162
00:17:33,882 --> 00:17:36,735
I will show, a feast

163
00:17:36,735 --> 00:17:40,903
And while looking you will find a treat

164
00:17:40,903 --> 00:17:43,945
Dying for pleasure

165
00:17:43,945 --> 00:17:47,811
As the language into a pot of dulce de leche

166
00:17:47,811 --> 00:17:51,234
Divine, delicious,
perfect, glorious

167
00:17:51,234 --> 00:17:55,109
Splendid, lofty,
but it is dangerous

168
00:17:55,109 --> 00:18:01,042
Causes no harm to use straight

169
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:10,370
Do not you dare cut
more speck

170
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:16,293
Scared me bend
Makes me that I cut

171
00:18:16,293 --> 00:18:18,642
Very important

172
00:18:18,642 --> 00:18:20,305
Nothing sharp

173
00:18:20,305 --> 00:18:22,410
Neither far nor near

174
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,993
But be smart

175
00:18:24,351 --> 00:18:31,880
Spotlight

176
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:44,143
Oh how I miss my
Hood that seduces

177
00:19:18,394 --> 00:19:20,613
IN THE SAME WINDOW

178
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:56,529
There you are
In the window in front

179
00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:01,420
I want to see if you look at me

180
00:20:05,058 --> 00:20:10,207
And I'm here
In the window in front

181
00:20:10,207 --> 00:20:16,413
To play the game that never end

182
00:20:18,836 --> 00:20:24,303
Just look at each other find

183
00:20:24,303 --> 00:20:28,929
And come the temptation to look more

184
00:20:29,475 --> 00:20:35,355
Then your eye is my
and overcoming shyness

185
00:20:35,355 --> 00:20:42,495
In the silence I can see
You match

186
00:20:46,952 --> 00:20:52,679
We once again
Blind desire

187
00:20:52,679 --> 00:21:02,742
Will tonight
you gonna call me?

188
00:21:02,742 --> 00:21:08,859
And if you want
Can I be your comfort

189
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:14,735
And if you want
My wishes can reveal

190
00:21:14,735 --> 00:21:20,486
Hold you in your eyes and see me

191
00:21:20,765 --> 00:21:27,840
Making love until dawn

192
00:21:34,985 --> 00:21:40,395
And once again
Caught in my eye

193
00:21:40,395 --> 00:21:45,303
The same image comes to me cause

194
00:21:49,265 --> 00:21:54,265
And before the nudity
Try again

195
00:21:54,765 --> 00:21:59,420
Find a way to get closer

196
00:22:02,184 --> 00:22:07,765
This meeting which takes place in the same window

197
00:22:08,265 --> 00:22:13,265
Take me, come flooding

198
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:18,265
Music and heat my days always cold

199
00:22:18,765 --> 00:22:23,686
In me, you will find

200
00:22:23,686 --> 00:22:29,634

00:22:41,571 --> 00:22:47,358
Making love til dawn...

204
00:22:49,894 --> 00:22:52,547
I read in your eyes

205
00:22:52,547 --> 00:22:55,204
You want me too

206
00:22:55,204 --> 00:22:57,271
I want you...

207
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,144
I want you...

208
00:23:00,543 --> 00:23:04,067
I want you...

209
00:23:05,182 --> 00:23:11,772
But if you want
I offer my care

210
00:23:11,772 --> 00:23:17,271
If you want,
I'm by your side

211
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:23,191
Hug
in your eyes and see me

212
00:23:28,479 --> 00:23:33,771
Do not stop the game here
Do not go away soon

213
00:23:33,771 --> 00:23:40,310
I need you
Say yes

214
00:23:45,903 --> 00:23:48,265
I want to find

215
00:23:48,765 --> 00:23:52,265
Come get me

216
00:23:54,765 --> 00:24:08,265
So until tomorrow
On another evening

217
00:24:40,964 --> 00:24:44,595
GOING UP!

218
00:24:51,391 --> 00:24:55,265
No. .. Oh, no
Not really

219
00:24:55,765 --> 00:24:59,274
Think of the smell of sweat
In girls ugly

220
00:24:59,274 --> 00:25:02,191
In his parents making love
Yuck!

221
00:25:02,191 --> 00:25:08,619
No. .. What a terrible situation
I can not contain

222
00:25:12,123 --> 00:25:16,327
A. .. Only one
Just a minute

223
00:25:16,327 --> 00:25:18,503
Just get up in the closet

224
00:25:18,503 --> 00:25:21,851
Just pick up the towel
And I could cover

225
00:25:21,851 --> 00:25:28,711
Ouch... Just... It is a natural defect
What clubs can not think

226
00:25:33,071 --> 00:25:37,111
Ar .. More air
Breathe!

227
00:25:37,111 --> 00:25:42,670
Pretending to be alone in complete calm
If I try, I can

228
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:49,235
More... Ar .. Hard evidence
will prove that I'm gay

229
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,265
Eye to the boys of bodybuilding

230
00:25:53,765 --> 00:25:56,779
- The Football
- From swimming

231
00:25:56,779 --> 00:26:02,747
Torture, suffering, destruction

232
00:26:02,747 --> 00:26:06,358
I can not do more and too much effort

233
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:11,643
Can not ever control my horny

234
00:26:11,643 --> 00:26:14,927
I hide with hand

235
00:26:16,012 --> 00:26:19,097
Going up!

236
00:26:19,765 --> 00:26:21,935
- No. ..
- Oh
- Air

237
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:25,554
Going up

238
00:26:25,554 --> 00:26:28,831
- The smell of sweat
- Contain Me
- I'm just

239
00:26:28,831 --> 00:26:31,899
Body and mind, concentration

240
00:26:31,899 --> 00:26:34,993
I know that these bodies give dappled frisson

241
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:38,644
But pointing fingers is not so good

242
00:26:38,871 --> 00:26:40,483
Going up!

243
00:26:45,831 --> 00:26:50,315
Stop! Yes, stop
Do not think...

244
00:26:50,315 --> 00:26:53,863
- For the more I think
- More he looms

245
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:55,662
And you can betray me

246
00:26:55,662 --> 00:26:58,083
God!
Stop!

247
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:01,879
And he never obeys me
Always be controlled

248
00:27:03,379 --> 00:27:06,377
Mother Nature can ruin me.

249
00:27:06,377 --> 00:27:09,631
- Or do I take
- How humiliating!

250
00:27:09,631 --> 00:27:14,765
And which of us will win?

251
00:27:15,265 --> 00:27:18,265
I own me,
I will not call attention.

252
00:27:18,765 --> 00:27:24,206
Look now at the ground
You are the slave and I am the Lord.

253
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:25,963
Please...

254
00:27:26,714 --> 00:27:28,816
It's embarrassing...

255
00:27:30,542 --> 00:27:32,528
Traitor...

256
00:27:34,761 --> 00:27:40,206
That healed, that tabby, so good, that torture
Doom, my God!

257
00:27:42,122 --> 00:27:46,811
Three... Two... Ummmmm
(They sing the same time)

258
00:27:54,902 --> 00:28:04,139
No, no, no, no, no, no
No! Going up!

259
00:28:04,139 --> 00:28:05,817
No. .. Just...
Ar .. Stop...

260
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:07,437
No. .. Just...
Ar .. Stop...

261
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:10,212
Going up

262
00:28:10,212 --> 00:28:13,171
- Collect.
- Viadinho.
- What a shame.

263
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:16,420
Behave or go out

264
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,303
If this happens, it may be my end

265
00:28:19,303 --> 00:28:24,424
They can not know
what's inside of me

266
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:32,006
- I feel alone

267
00:28:32,006 --> 00:28:35,116
- I feel alone

268
00:28:35,116 --> 00:28:42,090
- I feel alone

269
00:28:58,289 --> 00:29:03,438
USING ONLY THIS SONG

270
00:29:04,334 --> 00:29:07,996
[Mother]
Dear Aunt Ruby gave us a magazine G.

271
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:11,227
Can not believe you
was to expose himself this way.

272
00:29:11,227 --> 00:29:14,787
As I stare at people
this city now?

273
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:16,660
Where was your head?

274
00:29:20,678 --> 00:29:23,426
Hey Chris. Why do not you tell me that
would ruin his career

275
00:29:23,426 --> 00:29:24,375
not to mention mine?

276
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:29,075
I'm your agent, we gotta talk.
Wait, I'll answer the call...

277
00:29:36,514 --> 00:29:40,487
Marilyn Monroe came out in Playboy

278
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:44,698
And a calendar
Landed without clothes

279
00:29:44,698 --> 00:29:48,542
Everyone wondered
Mom called her a slut...

280
00:29:48,543 --> 00:29:53,095
But she has sold millions of magazines
and tripled his fortune.

281
00:29:53,096 --> 00:29:58,190
She was rude and a bit naive.

282
00:29:58,428 --> 00:30:02,688
And when asked:
"Honey what were you wearing?"

283
00:30:02,894 --> 00:30:05,838
Believe me, she replied:

284
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:09,394
"I was just using that song

285
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:14,394
Nothing, just that song

286
00:30:14,383 --> 00:30:18,344
I do not believe,
What do you too?

287
00:30:18,344 --> 00:30:23,394
And believe me
this is a beautiful song...

288
00:30:23,894 --> 00:30:27,394
Using only this song.

289
00:30:29,715 --> 00:30:33,266
The young Burt Reynolds
also proved.

290
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:37,010
In Cosmo,
everybody saw it.

291
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:40,991
On a bearskin rug
and a smile.

292
00:30:40,991 --> 00:30:43,548
Hand over the treasure.

293
00:30:43,548 --> 00:30:46,046
He had good taste

294
00:30:46,046 --> 00:30:52,116
And three decades later
My mother is still amazed!

295
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:54,328
But when it no longer a novelty

296
00:30:54,328 --> 00:30:56,394
embarrassed in my city...

297
00:30:56,894 --> 00:30:59,394
Burt became the number one...

298
00:30:59,894 --> 00:31:03,394
And he used only this song...

299
00:31:04,252 --> 00:31:07,640
Just used this song...

300
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,837
Now tell me,
What's wrong?

301
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:17,563
And believe me
this is a beautiful song...

302
00:31:17,563 --> 00:31:21,394
Using only this song.

303
00:31:34,745 --> 00:31:39,250
Only a few dreams
And with a pleasing personality

304
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:43,551
Even though ambitious, I'm shy.
(He's shy!)

305
00:31:43,551 --> 00:31:46,220
But know that even liked...

306
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:51,140
With flashes on me.
And with the clicks of cameras...

307
00:31:51,140 --> 00:32:01,211
I felt like a star
(One star)

308
00:32:02,977 --> 00:32:07,374
And I was only using this song.

309
00:32:07,374 --> 00:32:09,739
Using only this song...

310
00:32:09,739 --> 00:32:12,267
Using only this song...

311
00:32:12,267 --> 00:32:16,213
Now tell me,
What's wrong?

312
00:32:16,213 --> 00:32:24,418
And from now on
will always play my song

313
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:29,387
Yes!
Using only this song...

314
00:32:31,755 --> 00:32:39,175
I'm fine.
And much better than the rest.

315
00:32:39,175 --> 00:32:43,531
Using only this song...

316
00:32:43,531 --> 00:32:47,979
Using only this song...

317
00:32:47,979 --> 00:32:58,894
Using only this song...

318
00:33:15,935 --> 00:33:19,631
SONG OF PILA

319
00:33:30,807 --> 00:33:36,151
When problems persist in this life tormenting me

320
00:33:36,151 --> 00:33:41,291
When the subjects most petty harass me endlessly

321
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:48,059
My torment and despair ultimately end up

322
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:57,049
Well... I seek relief
is in my own hand

323
00:33:57,671 --> 00:34:02,291
I'll punch

324
00:34:03,688 --> 00:34:05,609
I'll punch

325
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:12,211
Banging his hand on my pylon
I'll never tiring kneading

326
00:34:13,246 --> 00:34:15,155
What a feeling

327
00:34:15,938 --> 00:34:17,410
Grind grain

328
00:34:18,202 --> 00:34:23,228
I'll crushing, grinding
Punch up running out of air

329
00:34:24,447 --> 00:34:26,500
To relax

330
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,072
I'll punch

331
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:37,555
No need to study
nor erudition

332
00:34:37,555 --> 00:34:42,926
Everything comes naturally
only with concentrations

333
00:34:42,926 --> 00:34:50,066
No need for partner
uniform or pectoral

334
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:53,746
Get ready, we will...

335
00:34:55,556 --> 00:34:59,702
... Demonstrate how it's done!

336
00:35:01,655 --> 00:35:05,938
I'll punch

337
00:35:06,882 --> 00:35:08,987
I'll punch

338
00:35:08,987 --> 00:35:11,430
Hitting the hand
In my pylon

339
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:13,953
I'll never tiring kneading...

340
00:35:14,771 --> 00:35:16,996
What a feeling

341
00:35:16,996 --> 00:35:18,216
Grind grain

342
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:25,012
I'll crushing, pressing
Punch up running out of air

343
00:35:25,431 --> 00:35:30,942
To relax... To relax... To relax
I'll punch

344
00:36:50,258 --> 00:36:55,339
We forgive the arrogance

345
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:59,996
Our sport is what is preferred

346
00:36:59,996 --> 00:37:02,163
It's good and not opposed to the terms of decency

347
00:37:02,163 --> 00:37:05,752
Garlic without punch

348
00:37:05,752 --> 00:37:13,985
causes flatulence

349
00:37:14,334 --> 00:37:19,154
I'll...

350
00:37:25,658 --> 00:37:26,978
I'll punch

351
00:37:27,671 --> 00:37:29,936
I'll punch
Banging his hand on my pylon

352
00:37:29,936 --> 00:37:31,790
I will knead without tiring.

353
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,063
I'll punch

354
00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:34,579
I'll punch

355
00:37:35,043 --> 00:37:38,486
I'll tell you
You see it to believe it, I punch up running out of air.

356
00:37:38,486 --> 00:37:39,947
With what pleasure

357
00:37:39,947 --> 00:37:41,483
I will temper

358
00:37:41,483 --> 00:37:44,450
After grinding
And then prove

359
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:47,619
Leave tan, wet
Then serve and eat

360
00:37:47,619 --> 00:37:51,335
In my mortar... In my mortar...
In my mortar... In my mortar...
In my mortar... I'll punch

361
00:37:51,335 --> 00:38:00,119
I'll punch!

362
00:38:29,718 --> 00:38:31,910
Robert Mitchum

363
00:38:40,122 --> 00:38:44,039
There must be something wrong with me.

364
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:47,924
Cause I do not think even a little sexy.

365
00:38:47,924 --> 00:38:51,271
Guys with perfect bodies.

366
00:38:51,271 --> 00:38:54,868
If showing how
Hollywood gods.

367
00:38:55,287 --> 00:38:58,174
What I've been everywhere

368
00:38:58,174 --> 00:39:01,992
In every movie, every book

369
00:39:01,992 --> 00:39:06,982
I see. I see. I see.
Mountains and mountains of muscles

370
00:39:06,982 --> 00:39:11,104
That just my horny.

371
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:17,779
For me,
I love the days of Robert Mitchum.

372
00:39:17,779 --> 00:39:20,842
I know he was chubby and flabby.

373
00:39:20,842 --> 00:39:24,796
But when she got naked.

374
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:27,951
Simply enchanted me...

375
00:39:28,779 --> 00:39:33,016
For me,
I remember the times when

376
00:39:33,016 --> 00:39:36,202
men were no more
so much time working out

377
00:39:37,278 --> 00:39:41,016
When a potbelly
was good to hug

378
00:39:41,016 --> 00:39:47,619
Oh my God,
Bring me the Robert Mitchum.

379
00:39:49,623 --> 00:39:53,325
I do not mean that
I am immune to the charms

380
00:39:53,325 --> 00:39:57,157
a defined chest
and muscular arm.

381
00:39:57,157 --> 00:40:00,523
But a failure here
a defeitinhos there

382
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:04,299
steal my look soon.

383
00:40:04,647 --> 00:40:07,653
I know I'll never be healed

384
00:40:07,653 --> 00:40:13,467
But to say that my heart is big.

385
00:40:13,467 --> 00:40:19,483
True, true! Oh my God!
At that time I would also be sexy.

386
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:25,514
Before the era of the implants
and liposuction.

387
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:31,283
For me,
I love the days of Robert Mitchum.

388
00:40:31,283 --> 00:40:34,289
Despite his smoking
and other things

389
00:40:34,582 --> 00:40:38,041
But when they played the tough guy

390
00:40:38,654 --> 00:40:41,331
Gave me the biggest boner.

391
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:46,683
For me,
I remember the times when the guys

392
00:40:46,683 --> 00:40:49,931
... Drinking lots of water and not beer,

393
00:40:50,537 --> 00:40:54,595
Or discuss the consistency of your skin.

394
00:40:54,595 --> 00:40:56,936
That's where I sear...

395
00:40:56,936 --> 00:41:01,016
I really want is Robert Mitchum.

396
00:41:11,515 --> 00:41:15,019
Do not you remember him?
He did Cape Fear?

397
00:41:16,095 --> 00:41:18,501
That was not just a movie,
was something extraordinary for me

398
00:41:19,267 --> 00:41:22,487
He was sexually and
murderously serious.

399
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:27,067
Tough and lightly dressed.

400
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:30,717
I'll never forget

401
00:41:30,717 --> 00:41:34,538
The close in his eyes that gave

402
00:41:34,538 --> 00:41:37,820
He knew exactly what to do.

403
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:43,686
A perfect tan
In the era of real men.

404
00:41:43,686 --> 00:41:46,654
As Robert Mitchum.

405
00:41:46,654 --> 00:41:48,266
And I'm not alone...

406
00:41:48,731 --> 00:41:53,192
For us,
We want the days of Robert Mitchum.

407
00:41:53,192 --> 00:41:55,893
When the guys came
in all shapes and sizes.

408
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,831
And some even managed a couple.

409
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:02,926
And as played out conversation...

410
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:08,049
For us, we remember the times when
that men were not so young

411
00:42:08,049 --> 00:42:10,784
Or tall or skinny or healed.

412
00:42:11,019 --> 00:42:17,209
To be honest,
exagerandamente perfect.

413
00:42:17,209 --> 00:42:22,702
A perfect tan
In the era of real men.

414
00:42:22,702 --> 00:42:27,844

- In order categorical
- Or even metaphorical

427
00:44:56,756 --> 00:45:04,664
- It's all so rhetorical
- And even a little euphoric

428
00:45:05,718 --> 00:45:09,527
Without restriction at the outset

429
00:45:09,527 --> 00:45:12,199

I am a porn actor from the interior of Parana

00:48:52,803 --> 00:48:55,935
Mom does not like me go to work

461
00:48:55,935 --> 00:48:59,883
In my profession
Sex is my bread and butter

462
00:48:59,883 --> 00:49:03,295
But dad says
I'm gonna burn in hell.

463
00:49:03,295 --> 00:49:07,399
I was once an altar boy,
frustrated but my godmother

464
00:49:07,399 --> 00:49:10,422
Since the day he showed up naked

465

The neighbors commented,
aunts fainted

466
00:49:13,127 --> 00:49:14,896
When I chose this profession.

467
00:49:14,896 --> 00:49:17,755
Inside is already known

468
00:49:18,123 --> 00:49:20,462
Sex is forbidden topic

469
00:49:20,462 --> 00:49:22,599
Speaking of his own penis is taboo

470
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:25,782
While the scroll wheel

Business with pleasure

477
00:49:45,324 --> 00:49:47,324
And live the way I dreamed.

478
00:49:47,824 --> 00:49:50,324
But... If I say I never tire

479
00:49:50,824 --> 00:49:52,824
Never to drown the goose
For the cameras

The people already starting to attack me

485
00:50:10,783 --> 00:50:12,324
I did not pay attention,

486
00:50:12,824 --> 00:50:14,324

My jet is so powerful nor so

490
00:50:25,824 --> 00:50:27,324
But if the money is legal,

491
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:30,143
show the snake with sticks and bush

492
00:50:30,143 --> 00:50:32,324
Buy clothes, car, house and garden.

493
00:50:32,824 --> 00:50:35,388
See...
I know that my success

494
00:50:35,388 --> 00:50:37,467

In both positions I can play...

498
00:50:48,121 --> 00:50:50,159
If I sometimes feel guilty,

499
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:51,891
a gorgeous body is the excuse

500
00:50:51,891 --> 00:50:55,623
To moan, pant,
grunting, calling for more...

501
00:50:55,623 --> 00:50:59,540
And the movie go running

507
00:51:23,851 --> 00:51:27,547
My work is unusual,

508
00:51:27,547 --> 00:51:30,620
I do not judge anyone

509
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:34,943
I pride myself that I embraced this life

510
00:51:35,211 --> 00:51:39,185
Only because of my home

511
00:51:39,185 --> 00:51:43,983
I decided to rebel

512
00:51:43,983 --> 00:51:47,787

Helpless and so alone

Lacking and directionless

523
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:14,157
I got angry, got lost

524
00:53:15,222 --> 00:53:19,411

Weak, me

530
00:53:39,843 --> 00:53:43,744
And I was weaker

531
00:53:44,157 --> 00:53:49,279

00:53:56,890 --> 00:53:59,320
I remember it well

533
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:04,740
I can no longer hold

534

Weak, I was

541
00:54:35,423 --> 00:54:38,225
And left me weaker

542
00:54:38,515 --> 00:54:43,764

544
00:54:49,864 --> 00:54:54,353
I imagine you still here

545
00:54:55,396 --> 00:55:00,793
Life goes on
What steps do I take?

546
00:55:00,793 --> 00:55:03,702
Memory
Nostalgia

547
00:55:03,702 --> 00:55:08,171
Memories too
Still

548
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:09,364
Bound

549
00:55:09,864 --> 00:55:16,864
You and I

550
00:55:17,364 --> 00:55:19,671
But if I look good

551
00:55:20,815 --> 00:55:23,702
Every time I see more

552
00:55:23,702 --> 00:55:29,065
Cris, so I wanted!

553
00:55:31,046 --> 00:55:34,669
(His nephew was born)

554
00:55:35,972 --> 00:55:37,505
(My parents moved again)

555
00:55:38,344 --> 00:55:41,055
(The Arthur is a famous artist)

556
00:55:41,846 --> 00:55:47,561
They are all well

557
00:55:47,561 --> 00:55:55,402
The world is moving
There is war and peace

558
00:55:55,402 --> 00:55:58,318
Life takes me

559
00:55:58,318 --> 00:56:05,364
I feel good

560
00:56:05,864 --> 00:56:08,364
Today I am stronger

561
00:56:08,864 --> 00:56:12,748
Remembering you

562
00:56:12,748 --> 00:56:15,415
Cris...

563
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:27,419
I try to look
For things that make me well

564
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:31,714
With my friends

565
00:56:31,714 --> 00:56:34,967
I feel happy.

566
00:56:34,967 --> 00:56:38,139
I dream
I laugh

567
00:56:38,391 --> 00:56:42,824
The winter is over

568
00:56:42,824 --> 00:56:46,364
Your face
Warm me

569
00:56:46,864 --> 00:56:55,067
Eternal Summer

570
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:11,762
Cris, how much I wanted

571
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:13,779
Oh, Cris...

572
00:57:15,612 --> 00:57:18,276
Oh, Cris...

573
00:57:20,034 --> 00:57:25,518
Oh, Cris...

574
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:46,355
It made me so happy...

575
00:58:00,347 --> 00:58:03,058
BELO BOFE WELL PUMP

576
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:15,210
It is six o'clock
Sunrise
My god, what sleep tremendous

577
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:17,164
Everyone in a good mood
Except me

578
00:58:17,164 --> 00:58:19,255
That punishment is to have a tire

579
00:58:22,346 --> 00:58:23,710
My eye says: No!

580
00:58:24,253 --> 00:58:25,627
The mouth says: No!

581
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,564
The mind says No!

582
00:58:27,992 --> 00:58:32,619
But he says:
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

583
00:58:32,905 --> 00:58:36,283
To be a great breeder and pumped

584
00:58:36,283 --> 00:58:38,575
It's good to get a heavier weight

585
00:58:38,575 --> 00:58:42,518
To be a great breeder and pumped

586
00:58:42,518 --> 00:58:47,902
It's good to get an ever increasing...

587
00:58:51,468 --> 00:58:53,732
Sweating profusely
My body hurts

588
00:58:53,732 --> 00:58:55,634
Maldita series
What destroys me

589
00:58:55,634 --> 00:58:59,509
I look in the mirror and feel good
But seeing the Barbie I'm a nobody

590
00:58:59,509 --> 00:59:01,316
I look high and I think: "Who am I?"

591
00:59:01,316 --> 00:59:03,211
What misfortune is to have a tire

592
00:59:06,419 --> 00:59:08,225
Biceps: No!

593
00:59:08,225 --> 00:59:09,751
Triceps: No!

594
00:59:10,062 --> 00:59:11,606
Abdomen: No!

595
00:59:12,152 --> 00:59:16,752
But he says:
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

596
00:59:16,752 --> 00:59:20,412
To be a great breeder and pumped

597
00:59:20,412 --> 00:59:22,652
It's good to get a heavier weight

598
00:59:22,652 --> 00:59:26,581
To be a great breeder and pumped...

599
00:59:26,581 --> 00:59:30,127
It's good to get a weight each

600
00:59:30,127 --> 00:59:31,308
greater!

601
00:59:35,555 --> 00:59:37,792
Run the treadmill
I'm breathless

602
00:59:37,792 --> 00:59:39,648
I can not get
Nowhere

603
00:59:39,648 --> 00:59:41,680
My feet burned, twisted, hurt
(Run always and not lose the air)

604
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,529
That martyrdom is to have a tire
(Run always and not lose the air)

605
00:59:43,529 --> 00:59:44,403
Thighs: No!

606
00:59:44,403 --> 00:59:45,553
The glutes, No!

607
00:59:45,553 --> 00:59:46,545
Heart: No!

608
00:59:46,545 --> 00:59:51,102
We know that this is torture

609
00:59:51,102 --> 00:59:55,448
Barbies never eat fried food.

610
01:00:27,303 --> 01:00:31,896
Just

611
01:00:32,509 --> 01:00:39,885
Good!
Since the shower

612
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:45,313
I'll slowly undressing

613
01:00:45,313 --> 01:00:49,977
That nervous

614
01:00:49,977 --> 01:00:54,396
Wrapped in a towel.

615
01:00:54,396 --> 01:00:59,642
So I go into the steam

616
01:00:59,848 --> 01:01:06,526
I notice the looks around me

617
01:01:06,526 --> 01:01:10,499
Groping try to see

618
01:01:10,499 --> 01:01:18,056
Hungry,
many eyes try to eat me...

619
01:01:24,318 --> 01:01:29,147
Heat
And sweat

620
01:01:29,147 --> 01:01:33,102
The bodies are incessantly

621
01:01:33,102 --> 01:01:40,492
I feel there is tension in the air.

622
01:02:26,172 --> 01:02:36,261
Steam...
Numbness...

623
01:02:36,841 --> 01:02:41,479
Heat...

624
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:56,921
My skin says: Oh!

625
01:02:58,931 --> 01:03:04,946
My hand says: Oh!

626
01:03:08,372 --> 01:03:13,532
My tongue says: Oh!

627
01:03:13,532 --> 01:03:16,420
And he says: Hi!

628
01:03:17,715 --> 01:03:19,170
Hi!

629
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,239
Hi ..

630
01:03:20,451 --> 01:03:21,983
Later?

631
01:03:21,983 --> 01:03:24,061
Of course, later!

632
01:03:26,472 --> 01:03:30,754
Juliet has not only Romeos

633
01:03:31,451 --> 01:03:38,185
Flee now the sauna

634
01:03:38,185 --> 01:03:40,085
More air, my God!

635
01:03:51,402 --> 01:03:56,304
If the angels of heaven are too muscular

636
01:03:56,304 --> 01:04:01,040
The sky is... the sky is... is...

637
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:06,135
Hotter than hell. Amen

638
01:04:09,578 --> 01:04:11,694
You may think I'm delirious

639
01:04:11,694 --> 01:04:13,775
But it is only because I'm working out

640
01:04:13,775 --> 01:04:15,504
If your goal is to increase

641
01:04:15,504 --> 01:04:17,245
It does not matter which head will lead

642
01:04:17,245 --> 01:04:19,313
Who cares if the low win?

643
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:21,129
It alone warrants my pleasure

644
01:04:21,129 --> 01:04:23,043
Cursed is the time to raise

645
01:04:23,262 --> 01:04:25,096
But I know the reason I work out...

646
01:04:26,341 --> 01:04:31,164
For he says:
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

647
01:04:31,164 --> 01:04:35,252
Yeah!
Yeah, yeah!

648
01:05:09,819 --> 01:05:13,267
THE ARTIST

649
01:05:22,371 --> 01:05:26,755
You see me here

650
01:05:26,755 --> 01:05:31,922
Do not know how many lives can I live

651
01:05:31,922 --> 01:05:34,653
Do not know who I am

652
01:05:34,653 --> 01:05:39,664
And what does this mirror you see?

653
01:05:39,664 --> 01:05:45,516
I surrender to my role
I am faithful to the stage

654
01:05:45,516 --> 01:05:50,568
Here it is: "To be or not"

655
01:05:50,568 --> 01:05:56,146
Corner then
A good verse

656
01:05:56,146 --> 01:06:01,052
I dance well
Do not miss the tone

657
01:06:01,052 --> 01:06:03,183
You just

658
01:06:03,183 --> 01:06:06,179
Breathless...

659
01:06:06,909 --> 01:06:10,432
How sublime to see someone

660
01:06:10,432 --> 01:06:17,874
represent...

661
01:06:21,508 --> 01:06:23,343
But I lied

662
01:06:25,527 --> 01:06:27,569
I pretend well

663
01:06:27,569 --> 01:06:32,196
Right now I'm thinking:
"God, that bag is fake"

664
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:33,838
But for you

665
01:06:33,838 --> 01:06:39,623
I can be
(Being) a great artist

666
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:44,151
Betty Midler is divine
And Barbra Streisand is emotion?

667
01:06:44,151 --> 01:06:46,371
They feel hunger, boredom, anger

668
01:06:46,371 --> 01:06:48,135
or sleep and lose track

669
01:06:48,135 --> 01:06:50,127
With faith insist...

670
01:06:50,127 --> 01:06:53,210
How do I resist

671
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:56,135
They are always artists

672
01:06:56,135 --> 01:06:59,754
We know well
It tastes

673
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:02,875
Being an artist.

674
01:07:03,488 --> 01:07:07,564
If I bare what's left to see?

675
01:07:07,564 --> 01:07:11,306
Only an outline of what I can do

676
01:07:11,306 --> 01:07:15,206
E class and rehearsal and singing
and dancing to satisfy you

677
01:07:15,206 --> 01:07:18,569
But if the bottom of my wardrobe
you spy

678
01:07:19,072 --> 01:07:23,718
Will notice that I sweat, get tired, I tremble,
cough and lose the air... air... air

679
01:07:23,718 --> 01:07:25,958
Ooooh!

680
01:07:26,965 --> 01:07:29,472
Air!

681
01:07:32,026 --> 01:07:33,468
Jerry...

682
01:07:41,872 --> 01:07:43,641
Thanks!

683
01:07:43,641 --> 01:07:47,597
Air!

684
01:07:48,203 --> 01:07:50,146
I know how to lie

685
01:07:50,146 --> 01:07:52,322
But I will follow

686
01:07:52,322 --> 01:07:54,431
Backstage at the mirror crying

687
01:07:54,431 --> 01:07:56,323
And think of escape

688
01:07:56,323 --> 01:07:57,873
It always does

689
01:07:57,873 --> 01:07:59,814
Good and bad

690
01:07:59,814 --> 01:08:01,490
This is be...

691
01:08:01,490 --> 01:08:03,593
... Artist...

692
01:08:03,593 --> 01:08:05,622
Here shine

693
01:08:05,622 --> 01:08:07,685
Back then delete

694
01:08:07,685 --> 01:08:10,421
Just being an artist

695
01:08:10,421 --> 01:08:12,376
Come on, guys!

696
01:08:50,695 --> 01:08:55,504
If I bare what's left to see?

697
01:08:55,504 --> 01:08:59,285
Only an outline of what I can do

698
01:08:59,285 --> 01:09:02,842
E class and rehearsal and singing and dancing to satisfy you

699
01:09:02,842 --> 01:09:06,211
But if you under my costume spy

700
01:09:06,467 --> 01:09:09,086
You will see that I have foot pain

701
01:09:09,086 --> 01:09:11,103
Ingrown toenails, calluses and foot odor

702
01:09:11,103 --> 01:09:12,868
Cramps, gas and indigestion

703
01:09:12,868 --> 01:09:14,813
Laryngitis, bronchitis, hoarseness and also

704
01:09:14,813 --> 01:09:16,483
Bloated, nauseated, it'll throw up

705
01:09:16,483 --> 01:09:18,306
Tired, numb, trying to pee

706
01:09:18,306 --> 01:09:23,503
Lonely, frustrated, needy and depressed...

707
01:09:23,503 --> 01:09:24,927
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no

708
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:26,771
Cry for me

709
01:09:26,771 --> 01:09:29,090
Here I know I know nothing

710
01:09:29,090 --> 01:09:32,318
It's everything I dreamed

711
01:09:32,516 --> 01:09:36,298
Ah, that's good
Has sound and fury

712
01:09:36,298 --> 01:09:40,352
When the curtain opens, I show my gift

713
01:09:40,352 --> 01:09:42,897
Our show will go on

714
01:09:43,824 --> 01:09:46,777
You and I are a pair

715
01:09:46,777 --> 01:09:47,534
Par!

716
01:09:47,534 --> 01:09:50,365
It is too good there my name on the poster

717
01:09:50,365 --> 01:09:54,924
I do pose, I get flower
but I know it is all a fleeting dream

718
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:57,507
There are those who resist?

719
01:09:57,507 --> 01:09:58,847
I die to be a great...

720
01:09:58,847 --> 01:10:05,304
Artist!

721
01:10:05,908 --> 01:10:15,051
(It's time to applaud)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

722
01:10:31,285 --> 01:10:35,155
IN THE SAME WINDOW
(REPRISE)

723
01:10:58,175 --> 01:11:00,187
There you are

724
01:11:00,651 --> 01:11:03,710
In the window in front

725
01:11:03,710 --> 01:11:08,950
I want to see if you look at me.

726
01:11:11,799 --> 01:11:14,214
And we once again

727
01:11:14,743 --> 01:11:17,403
Blind desire

728
01:11:17,403 --> 01:11:22,903
Will tonight
you gonna call me?

729
01:11:22,903 --> 01:11:27,481
And if you want

730
01:11:27,481 --> 01:11:30,767
Can I be your comfort

731
01:11:30,767 --> 01:11:33,551
And if you want

732
01:11:33,551 --> 01:11:36,259
My wishes can reveal

733
01:11:36,259 --> 01:11:39,280
Hug

734
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:44,741
in your eyes and see me

735
01:11:44,741 --> 01:11:53,685
Making love til dawn...

736
01:11:53,685 --> 01:11:56,595
But if you want

737
01:11:56,595 --> 01:11:59,520
I offer my care

738
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:05,015
If you want

739
01:12:05,016 --> 01:12:09,893
I'm by your side

740
01:12:09,893 --> 01:12:13,843
Hold you in your eyes and see me

741
01:12:13,843 --> 01:12:16,435
Do not stop the game here

742
01:12:16,435 --> 01:12:19,315
Do not go away soon

743
01:12:19,315 --> 01:12:22,068
I need you
Say yes

744
01:12:22,068 --> 01:12:30,243
I want to find
Come get me

745
01:12:33,473 --> 01:12:34,815
So until tomorrow...

746
01:12:36,219 --> 01:12:46,555
On another evening...

747
01:13:25,312 --> 01:13:30,992
I get so exposed (I'm so exposed)

748
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:42,505
What remains to show?
(What's left to show?)

749
01:13:43,751 --> 01:13:48,347
The doors closed
(The doors closed)

750
01:13:48,895 --> 01:13:55,711
There is nothing to hide
(There is nothing to hide)

751
01:14:14,335 --> 01:14:19,495
And today I realized

752
01:14:19,495 --> 01:14:24,419
What drives my desire

753
01:14:24,419 --> 01:14:27,910
Then comes the embrace of the shadow

754
01:14:27,910 --> 01:14:30,541
And this meeting is the loop

755
01:14:30,541 --> 01:14:36,054
That binds me to be another

756
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:40,727
I'm ready to understand

757
01:14:40,727 --> 01:14:45,850
The love that brings me so

758
01:14:46,503 --> 01:14:50,477
I know I want to undress me

759
01:14:50,477 --> 01:14:55,893
Of shame in me

760
01:14:55,893 --> 01:15:02,347
The truth I'll get

761
01:15:02,347 --> 01:15:09,107
Not knowing where I'm going

762
01:15:14,951 --> 01:15:20,060
I'll look for my
Looking for my

763
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:25,916
Look at my body

764
01:15:25,951 --> 01:15:32,828
And try to see who I am.

765
01:15:32,828 --> 01:15:36,717
And if you want

766
01:15:36,717 --> 01:15:40,543
Can I be your refuge

767
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:49,387
And if you want

768
01:15:49,387 --> 01:16:00,715
Today I can give myself
Hold you in your eyes and see me...

769
01:16:03,266 --> 01:16:06,279
Here
You use the ticket

770
01:16:06,279 --> 01:16:09,360
I am a porn actor from the interior of Parana...

771
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,275
I like every time
more of my profession.

772
01:16:12,275 --> 01:16:15,230
Here
Our dance group is a success.

773
01:16:15,230 --> 01:16:17,074
Using only this song...

774
01:16:17,074 --> 01:16:18,039
Going up!

775
01:16:18,039 --> 01:16:20,679
Finally,
Prepare yourself: Let's sing!

776
01:16:20,679 --> 01:16:23,611
I'll punch, I punch,
I punch, I punch

777
01:16:23,611 --> 01:16:26,313
Finally,
The few who dare to show

778
01:16:26,313 --> 01:16:27,963
Come and Robert Mitchum.

779
01:16:27,963 --> 01:16:30,661
I am a great artist!

780
01:16:30,661 --> 01:16:33,346
Here there is no Shakespeare or Moliere has

781
01:16:33,346 --> 01:16:36,155
Critics write what she wants

782
01:16:36,155 --> 01:16:39,830
I hear you moan

783
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:41,835
(Yes, you howl!)

784
01:16:41,835 --> 01:16:46,752
It is sensational
Thus the natural

785
01:16:46,752 --> 01:16:49,760
Like any mortal

786
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:52,241
The coolest part

787
01:16:52,241 --> 01:16:54,156
Our...
Our...

788
01:16:54,156 --> 01:16:55,607
Our...
Our...

789
01:16:55,607 --> 01:17:00,178
Nudity...

790
01:17:00,178 --> 01:17:01,407
Total...

791
01:18:35,116 --> 01:18:38,181
RETURN TO THE STAGE

792
01:18:41,243 --> 01:18:44,555
You liked it and will have a.

793
01:18:44,616 --> 01:18:48,500
Hip hip hurray! Naked Boys Singing!

794
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:51,725
And together we sing with one voice

795
01:18:51,725 --> 01:18:55,235
We show everything
And you did not laugh for nothing

796
01:18:55,235 --> 01:18:58,783
Modesty aside, yes
Our roguery is good

797
01:18:58,783 --> 01:19:01,639
Come back again
To drop the chicken!

798
01:19:01,639 --> 01:19:05,203
Naked Boys, Naked Boys, Naked Boys
Naked Boys, Naked Boys

799
01:19:05,203 --> 01:19:08,947
Singing!
