1
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,191
On behalf of your commanding officer,
I'm sure I can tell Mr. José lturbi...

2
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,352
...that the officers and crew
of this ship are grateful to him...

3
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,239
...for coming here to lead
our Navy bands in this ceremony.

4
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,837
Along with every other civilian,
it is I who am grateful to you...

5
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,560
...and to all the men
in the United States Navy.

6
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,678
The men who are to be decorated
are present, sir.

7
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,309
Joseph Brady,
Gunner's Mate Second Class.

8
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,278
Clarence Doolittle, Seaman First Class.

9
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,553
During the action aboard
the USS cruiser <i>Knoxville...</i>

10
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,790
...these two men
remained at their stations...

11
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,520
...serving their gun
until the ammunition was exhausted.

12
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,513
When by force of explosion,
Doolittle was blown overboard...

13
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,076
...Joseph Brady, without regard
for his own personal safety...

14
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,834
...dived into the sea
and rescued his shipmate.

15
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,719
Acting for the secretary of the Navy,
I award you both the Silver Star.

16
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,198
- Congratulations, Brady.
- Thank you, sir.

17
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,118
- Congratulations, Doolittle.
- Thank you, sir.

18
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,669
To the men who formally
served on the <i>Knoxville...</i>

19
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,717
...including those
I've just decorated...

20
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,878
...you'll be granted four days' leave,
effective immediately.

21
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,036
Leave your quarter.

22
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,635
Let me through, boys.

23
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,837
Yeah, I'm hopeful.

24
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,556
The poor little fellas.

25
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,109
They gotta stay and mind the ship
for the admiral.

26
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,635
- That's right.
- That's it, rub it in.

27
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,956
They don't get to go to Hollywood...

28
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,429
...where the beautiful dames
grow like oranges.

29
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,354
Where all you gotta do is reach out
and pick them right off the street.

30
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,112
- Congratulations, Joe.
- Thanks.

31
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,918
You'll probably visit the studios...

32
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,799
...if you see those stars,
will you get me some autographs?

33
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,269
Oh, no, not this baby.
After eight months at sea...

34
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,318
...it ain't a bunch of autographs
I'm gonna wind up with. Here.

35
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,233
- I got plans.
- What kind of plans, Joe?

36
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,076
Well, in Hollywood,
I've got a little plan named Lola.

37
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,759
Oh, that Lola.

38
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,956
I tell you, she's a...

39
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,795
Well, it isn't exactly that,
but it's a...

40
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,080
- No, it isn't that either.
- Tell us about her, Joe.

41
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,719
- Yeah.
- Well...

42
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,111
...notice how different the band
sounded with that guy lturbi leading?

43
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,236
- That was good.
- Lola's kind of like that.

44
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,789
Put her with the most beautiful dames
in the world...

45
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,712
...she's the one you'd see,
that's all.

46
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,952
You mean she's different, huh, Joe?

47
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,073
I wouldn't say that.

48
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,949
If you like dames, what's the point of
getting one different from other dames?

49
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,830
No, I guess it's just that whatever
the others have, Lola has more of it.

50
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,274
Does she got a sister?

51
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,829
Hey, what makes you think
this Lola is still waiting?

52
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,672
Dames have been known to wander.

53
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,834
From me? Please, sailor,
leave us not talk mutiny.

54
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,196
<i>Fall in to the port side of the hangar</i>
<i>deck for special leave.</i>

55
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,078
Oh, do you think
we can tear ourselves away?

56
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,276
Yeah, but it'll be tough.

57
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,716
- We hate to leave.
- We hate to leave.

58
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,634
<i>But when they give you leave</i>
<i>You gotta leave</i>

59
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,236
<i>Oh, our hearts bleed</i>
<i>For all of you guys aboard</i>

60
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,233
<i>But right now</i>
<i>Sympathy is a thing we can 't afford</i>

61
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,072
<i>- We hate to leave</i>
<i>- We hate to leave</i>

62
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,832
<i>- We hate to leave</i>
<i>- We hate to leave</i>

63
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,592
<i>Without you guys along</i>

64
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,637
<i>We'll grieve and grieve</i>

65
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,236
<i>But we'll be back, yes, we'll be back</i>
<i>Before we're even missed</i>

66
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,551
<i>And tell you guys about the countless</i>
<i>Dames that we have kissed</i>

67
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,312
<i>Believe us, mate</i>

68
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,118
<i>Believe us, mate</i>

69
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,829
<i>We really hate to leave</i>

70
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,237
You know, Clarence,
I think it's awful, us going ashore...

71
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,834
...leaving these guys here
in their undershirts...

72
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,956
...and we gotta go meet
beautiful dames...

73
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,678
...in their soft silk dresses.

74
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,912
Yeah, but duty is duty,
and an order is an order.

75
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,275
You know, I know some guys
that get a thrill...

76
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,874
...out of meeting a gorgeous gal
every night.

77
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,517
<i>We hate to leave</i>

78
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,591
<i>We hate to leave</i>

79
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,153
<i>But when they give you leave</i>

80
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,673
<i>You gotta leave</i>

81
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,911
<i>No more pinup gals</i>
<i>That we so enjoy</i>

82
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,117
<i>Tonight, fair boys</i>
<i>We get to meet the real McCoy</i>

83
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,958
<i>We hate to leave</i>

84
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,633
<i>We hate to leave</i>

85
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,552
<i>But we'll be back before</i>

86
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,597
<i>The anchors heave</i>

87
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,230
<i>We wanna stay, we wanna stay</i>
<i>Our hearts are with the ship</i>

88
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,597
<i>But the admiral made us take this leave</i>
<i>He beat us with a whip</i>

89
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,557
<i>Believe us, mate</i>

90
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,392
<i>Believe us, mate</i>

91
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,994
<i>We really</i>

92
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,630
<i>Hate to leave</i>

93
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,073
But, honey, I saved every minute
of my leave for you.

94
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,149
Oh, why shouldn't I have?

95
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,791
Oh, you're the only one any place
I wanna see.

96
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,678
What's he doing wrong, Joe?

97
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,637
He's dead, that's all. Watch.

98
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,074
But ho...

99
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,755
But, honey, I don't wanna meet
your boyfriend's ex-girlfriend.

100
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,990
I wanna meet you.

101
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,234
Well, you'll be sorry.

102
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,518
You'll be sorry.

103
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,111
Hello, Ms. Laverne?

104
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,317
Ms. Lola Laverne?

105
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,959
Is this the face that launched
a thousand ships?

106
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,678
Yeah. Yeah, it's Joe, all right.

107
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,795
Don't anybody even want
a cup of coffee?

108
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,239
No business.

109
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,710
Well, it'll be a couple hours
before I hit Hollywood.

110
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,518
Can you wait?

111
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,508
Oh, I know what you mean, baby.

112
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,033
But you just try.

113
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,473
Let's decide that later,
after eight months at sea...

114
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,191
...all I wanna do is just look at you
for a long, long time.

115
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,712
Oh, you'll like. For sure.

116
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,915
- Come on, get a move on.
- Come on.

117
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,995
Come on, eight months
is a long enough time to wait.

118
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,392
Hello?

119
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,999
Hello, you beautiful creature.

120
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,075
When you hear the tone, the time
will be exactly 6: 10 and one quarter.

121
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,878
Buy war bonds.

122
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,794
Thank you, I will.

123
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,754
Hey, you guys,
the buses for Hollywood pulled up!

124
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,037
- Get me to Hollywood.
- Here we come.

125
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,236
- Here we go, boys. Come on.
- Hey.

126
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,029
- Give my regards to Lana Turner.
- Who needs a house in Hollywood?

127
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,556
<i>Anchors Aweigh</i>

128
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,191
<i>Farewell to college joys</i>
<i>We sail at...</i>

129
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,952
Hey, sonny.

130
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,190
- Hello.
- What's the matter?

131
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,679
Nothing. Why?

132
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,751
It's late at night,
where are you going?

133
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,593
- To join the Navy.
- Oh, well, you...

134
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,799
- Gonna what?
- I said, I'm going to join the Navy.

135
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,157
- Wait a minute.
- I'm in a hurry.

136
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,834
Take it easy. Where do you live?

137
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,911
- Why?
- Well, I wanna take you home.

138
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,029
But I'm not going home.
I've just come from there.

139
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,637
What's your name?

140
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,229
Look, it's my job
to find little boys that are lost.

141
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,516
Lost is when you don't know
where you're going.

142
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,592
And I do know,
I'm going to join the Navy.

143
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,119
- All right.
- Good night.

144
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,317
If that's the way you want it, okay.
You're coming to the station.

145
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,392
I don't wanna join the police.
I wanna join the Navy.

146
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,672
Stop there.

147
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,868
Are you following me?

148
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,753
What's with you?

149
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,433
Come on, spill it.

150
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,591
Well, you see, it's like this, Joe.

151
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,637
I've been in the Navy
a year and a half.

152
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,870
Every time we hit port
and get liberty...

153
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,395
...all I do is go to the library.

154
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,790
All right, so you like books,
what's the beef?

155
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,032
Well, I thought it'd be fun
to try something different...

156
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,792
...like going out with girls.

157
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,599
- Okay, good luck.
- But I don't know how to begin.

158
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,955
Oh, no, wait a minute.
Don't give me that "but."

159
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,998
After all, you're no yokel.
You're from Brooklyn.

160
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,873
Even in Brooklyn,
things can go wrong.

161
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,439
What do you mean?

162
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,318
Well, right from boys' high school...

163
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,914
...I went to the
Cathedral of Saint John the Divine...

164
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,036
...assistant choirmaster.

165
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,834
And out of there,
I went into the Navy.

166
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,395
I wouldn't tell that
to anyone but you, Joe.

167
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,033
Sure, sure, I'll keep it quiet.

168
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,191
What do you want,
a couple of phone numbers?

169
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,476
Oh, no, I'd be too scared to use them.

170
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,154
- When you mentioned Lola, I thought...
- Lola?

171
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,594
- Yeah.
- Hey, are you kidding?

172
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,034
Oh, not what you think, Joe.

173
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,430
I thought I'd like
to string along and learn.

174
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,637
After all, you're the best wolf
in the whole Navy.

175
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,917
Well, you are.
And besides, you gotta help me, Joe.

176
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,799
You saved my life
and you owe me something.

177
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,714
I saved your life
so now I owe you something?

178
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,359
Have you gone crazy?

179
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,069
Look, I didn't ask you to save my life,
but you did.

180
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,755
- Now I figure you're responsible for me.
- Well, I don't.

181
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,993
What's the sense of having your life
saved if you can't have any fun with it?

182
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,514
Look, I got a lot to do
in the next four days.

183
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,159
I don't want anybody tailing me.

184
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,998
You say I owe you something.

185
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,197
Well, I don't see it,
but if I find a dame for you...

186
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,590
...and get you started,
will you call it quits?

187
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,872
Okay, let me see.

188
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,431
Well, we'll have to do
with what you've got.

189
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,951
First place, fix your hat.

190
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,152
Let me see a sample
of your technique.

191
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,959
You're you, see?
And I'm a dame coming down the street.

192
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,758
Pick me up.

193
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,471
I'm a dame, see? I'm coming down
the street, now come on.

194
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,995
I beg your pardon, miss.
Lady, could I possibly...?

195
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,674
Oh, no. No.

196
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,279
You gotta give it more:

197
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,670
Listen, Brooklyn, when you're going
hunting it's how you feel that counts.

198
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,434
If you feel like a mouse,
you'll be looking for cheese...

199
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,194
...that's what you'll get.
But if you feel like a wolf...

200
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,271
...nothing can go wrong,
you're in control.

201
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,432
Hey, sailors, one of you guys gotta
come down to station with me.

202
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,353
- Any choice? You'll do. Come on.
- Hey, wait a minute.

203
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,431
Please, let's not have
any unpleasantness.

204
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,398
I'll go with you, Joe.
How can this happen to me?

205
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,199
Just when I'm beginning
to feel like a wolf.

206
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,029
The secretary of the Navy
will have a say about this.

207
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,599
Washington will hear about it.

208
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,955
Who's in charge here?
That's what I wanna know.

209
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,509
- Ship ahoy!
- Are you the guy that had me pulled in?

210
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,752
- Pardon me for not getting up.
- What's the charge? What's the idea?

211
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,195
- What are you...?
- Lf you've been inconvenienced...

212
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,634
...I'm sorry.

213
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,314
You see, this young man
thinks he should join the Navy.

214
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,959
We think he should go home.

215
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,793
Since he won't tell us
where he lives...

216
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,271
...we thought that maybe a sailor...

217
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,919
See?

218
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,312
So you wanna join the Navy, huh?

219
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,554
Aye, aye, sir.

220
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,112
Attention.

221
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,191
- Name?
- Don Martin, sir.

222
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,636
- Where do you live?
- 1515 Foothill Road.

223
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,719
My daddy was in the Navy...

224
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,314
...and he said that when
I was grown up, I could join.

225
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,954
And now I am grown up,
so I want to.

226
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,713
Well, sure, mate, but...

227
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,997
Well, look, it's this way.
There's sort of a rule in the Navy.

228
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,830
Before they'll take you, you need a letter
from your mom or dad saying it's okay.

229
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,828
But I don't have
a mother or father anymore.

230
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,236
I live with my Aunt Susie.

231
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,908
You think a letter from an aunt
would be all right?

232
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,636
Well, sure, that would be perfect.
Why don't you talk to her about it.

233
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,916
One of these guys
will take you home and...

234
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,036
- You.
- But I got...

235
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,548
- Gotta be a nursemaid and everything...
- Aunt Susie may not give me the letter...

236
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,915
...but if you asked her...

237
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,116
- You better come along too.
- Oh, no, I can't.

238
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,679
- You come along.
- No, I can't.

239
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,398
What am I gonna do about Lola?

240
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,634
I guess Aunt Susie
must be asleep, huh?

241
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,519
- She isn't home yet.
- I suppose the door is locked too.

242
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,079
Yes.

243
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,831
- But we can get in.
- How?

244
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,195
The way I got out.

245
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,034
Look out for my wagon.

246
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,078
"Dear Ms. Abbott,
Donald was a very good boy.

247
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,435
He's fast asleep.

248
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,519
So I went home. Mrs. Murphy."

249
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,519
I'll get you some candy.

250
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,035
- I know where Aunt Susie hides it.
- Wait a second.

251
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,634
- You think your aunt will be back soon?
- Oh, sure.

252
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,633
What do you mean, "oh, sure"?
How do you know?

253
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,836
Well, she lives here.

254
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,270
You know,
sometimes he talks like you.

255
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,513
Look, fellas...

256
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,435
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.
I don't want you to think I'd walk out...

257
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,315
Well, you gotta stay here with the kid
anyhow and talk to his aunt and...

258
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,956
Well, I got a date with a girl,
and there's no sense in all of us just...

259
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,715
Well, that's great. That's just dandy.

260
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,270
He's got a date with a girl. What's he
think I've got a date with, a duck?

261
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,716
Goodbye. Thanks, fellas.

262
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,709
Brooklyn, I'm blowing,
the baby's all yours.

263
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,871
Joe. Hey, Joe!

264
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,469
You can't leave me here,
what about my being a wolf?

265
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,598
- You promised me.
- You promised you'd talk to Aunt Susie.

266
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:27,436
If you don't help me, what will I do?
What will become of me?

267
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,793
Okay. Okay.

268
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,030
Who's he calling?

269
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,031
A girl.

270
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,920
Lola, baby.

271
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,159
Forgotten you?

272
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,151
Oh, honey.

273
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,118
With the picture of you
I've got in my mind?

274
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,909
Why, even across the phone,
I can see every...

275
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,917
Look, let me tell you what happened.

276
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,039
- I found a kid that was lost.
- Joe, I wasn't lost.

277
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,030
So I had to take him home.
I won't be long.

278
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:21,558
As long as I get there?
Oh, honey, you know I'll get there.

279
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,718
Look, we better talk
about that later, huh?

280
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,390
- Yeah, goodbye.
- What are you going to talk about later?

281
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,558
Things, sailor. Things.

282
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,392
You'll understand
when you get older.

283
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,634
- Everybody keeps saying that to me.
- Yeah, they used to say that to me too.

284
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,598
Well, did you understand
when you got older?

285
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,358
Nope.

286
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,110
I wonder what could be keeping
that Aunt Susie.

287
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,430
What can an old lady
be doing out this late?

288
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,960
Susan, don't you wish
that you were up there?

289
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,874
I've never heard his voice sound so
beautiful. There's something about him.

290
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,352
He always gets so much from a singer.
I'd give anything to work with him.

291
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,471
Cut it! Print that.

292
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,672
Okay, children, you go home now
and thanks very much for the day.

293
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,558
No callback.

294
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,874
Good night.

295
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,349
- Mr. Iturbi, l...
- Good night, Susie.

296
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,794
Good night, Tom. L...

297
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,190
- How's that for camera?
- Right on the nose.

298
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,158
Tell me, Bill, when are we going
to shoot the boogie-woogie?

299
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,715
- Good night. Thanks a lot.
- Good night, dear.

300
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,553
- Good night.
- Good night.

301
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,632
Hi, Aunt Susie.

302
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,674
Well, what got you home so early,
your feet give out?

303
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,510
- What?
- Dames like you kill me.

304
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,716
Don't you ever think of anybody
but yourself?

305
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,589
Leaving the little kid alone while you're
out chasing around, having a big time.

306
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,990
Would you mind telling me
just who you are...

307
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,559
...and what you're doing here?

308
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,513
I'm a guy the police called
when they picked this kid up...

309
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,750
...wandering around the boulevard,
that's all.

310
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,480
That wouldn't interest you,
so if you step aside, lady...

311
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,552
- Well, just a moment. I don't...
- Don't apologize.

312
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,314
Just clear the deck.
Come on, Brooklyn.

313
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,557
But I...

314
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,073
- Bye.
- Aunt Susie.

315
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,835
- But, Aunt Susie...
- Joe. Hey, Joe. Listen, the kid's crying.

316
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,992
Well, if I had to live
with a dame like that, I'd cry too.

317
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,832
I thought she was sort of nice.

318
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,560
A dame that leaves a kid
alone that way ain't nice.

319
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,029
Wait a minute, please.
You didn't give me a chance.

320
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,792
- Donald explained and...
- Okay, okay.

321
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,757
It was all a mistake,
and you're sorry.

322
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,876
But my pal and I got plans
for the night.

323
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,474
- We'd like to get going.
- I haven't got a thing to do.

324
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,792
Well, I thought, if you didn't mind,
that you could come back for a while.

325
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,713
It's Donald, he's so upset
and it's way past his bedtime.

326
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,270
Well, sure we will.
We didn't even say goodbye.

327
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,030
Is something wrong, Joe?

328
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,272
I thought you'd gone.

329
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,954
Hey, hey, sailor, what is this?
What's with you?

330
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,917
You forgot about me.

331
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,278
About what you promised.
You know, the letter.

332
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,394
Oh, sure, the letter.

333
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,993
You see, it's this way.

334
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,550
The kid here wanted to join the Navy,
but I told him about the rule.

335
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,156
You know, the rule about needing a
letter from your folks saying it's okay.

336
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,595
Donald thought
if Joe asked you for the letter...

337
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,638
Oh, Donald, suppose you and I
talk about that in the morning.

338
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,959
If you give it to me now,
I can go right with Joe.

339
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,156
You want me to go with you,
don't you?

340
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,955
Well, sure, kid, but...

341
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,715
Wait a second,
there are a couple of things...

342
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,553
...you need beside the letter,
you gotta have a...

343
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,436
Can you read and write?

344
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,954
No, he can't.
He plays hooky all the time.

345
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,076
You mean to say
you can't read and write?

346
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,356
You think the Navy takes dopes?

347
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,794
Not ever?

348
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,631
Well, maybe sometimes. But even the
dopes have to be able to read and write.

349
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,268
No, I'm sorry, kid, it's just no soap.

350
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,512
Joe, now what will I do?

351
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,355
Well, the first thing you gotta do,
you gotta go to school and study hard.

352
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,437
Before you know it,
you won't be a dope.

353
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,473
Now, young man,
how about going to bed, huh?

354
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,112
All right,
but I want Joe to put me to bed.

355
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,554
Oh, really, Donald.

356
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,951
We can't keep these gentlemen any
longer, they have other things to do.

357
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,236
No, they haven't. They're on leave.

358
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,233
We'd be very happy to put him to bed,
wouldn't we, Joe?

359
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,198
Oh, thank you,
but you've done enough already.

360
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,434
Joe?

361
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,351
Okay, okay, but no stalling.

362
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,277
Come on, you helper, you.

363
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,152
<i>Anchors aweigh, my boy</i>

364
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,875
<i>Anchors aweigh</i>

365
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,794
Hey, hit the sack, sailor.
Get in there.

366
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,472
Joe, you're coming back
to see me, promise?

367
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,837
Sure, sure, sure, that's a deal.
Come on, now, get in bed. Come on.

368
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,551
- All set?
- No, I always get sung to sleep.

369
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,390
Look what wants to join the Navy.

370
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,597
Hey, listen, bub, do you think
anybody sings us sailors to sleep?

371
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,512
But I'm not in the Navy yet.

372
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,353
So it's all right
for me to be sung to.

373
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,673
Well, he's right. He's right.

374
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,792
All right.

375
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,234
You sing to him.

376
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,551
After all, you're the choirmaster
around here, not me.

377
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,233
Oh, Joe.

378
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,789
I told you that
in the strictest of confidence.

379
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,753
And you promised
never to bring it up.

380
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,073
<i>Lullaby</i>

381
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,953
<i>And good night</i>

382
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:18,871
<i>With roses bedight</i>

383
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,230
<i>Bright angels</i>

384
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:29,270
<i>Around my darling</i>

385
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,674
<i>Shall stand</i>

386
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,551
<i>Lay thee down now</i>

387
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,950
<i>And rest</i>

388
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,479
<i>May thy slumber</i>

389
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,754
<i>Be blessed</i>

390
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,558
<i>Lay thee down now</i>

391
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,075
<i>And rest</i>

392
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,276
<i>May thy slumber</i>

393
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,793
<i>Be blessed</i>

394
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,192
- They're asleep.
- Your friend too?

395
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,230
Well, I made some coffee.

396
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,756
Oh, you shouldn't have.
I mean, it's swell, but...

397
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,638
Oh, it's nothing.

398
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,112
Is something wrong?

399
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,077
Oh, no.

400
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,829
- Well, did you have a nice nap?
- Come on, Brooklyn.

401
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,833
- But I have coffee and sandwiches.
- Sorry, gotta blow. Thanks.

402
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,434
- Well, you've been awful nice.
- Forget it. So long.

403
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,238
Goodbye. Thanks. Thanks again.

404
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,551
Hey, Joe, there's something
I gotta talk to you about.

405
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,312
I know you're not gonna like this.

406
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,232
Remember what you
were gonna do for me?

407
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,359
About getting a girl, I mean.
I've seen the one I want.

408
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,034
- Oh, no. No, Brooklyn.
- But, Joe, you promised me.

409
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,430
Okay, I promised you,
but not Aunt Susie.

410
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,114
I didn't promise you Aunt Susie.

411
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,998
Good night.

412
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,833
But, Lola, it's not that late.
It's never that late.

413
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,788
Oh, baby, I know you're tired, but...

414
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,076
What do you mean, it's for my sake?

415
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,993
Well, honey,
I wouldn't be disappointed in you.

416
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,993
Oh, baby, I couldn't be.

417
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,512
Okay. Okay.

418
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,195
No, no, no, I'm not sore.
I'll be by tomorrow.

419
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,517
Twelve o'clock?

420
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,716
In the morning?

421
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,995
Well, all right,
if that's what you want.

422
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,028
Goodbye.

423
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,436
- Gee, Joe, that's tough.
- Yeah. Hurry up, huh?

424
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,032
- What's the Navy coming to, bud?
- I ask myself that.

425
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,318
Say, Joe...?

426
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,358
Joe, I don't wanna
keep messing up your plans.

427
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,671
What I mean is, we won't have to look
for a girl for me tomorrow.

428
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,273
We've already found Aunt Susan.

429
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,955
Listen, Brooklyn, I didn't save your life
to hand it over to that character.

430
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,917
I'm gonna get you a dame
that's a dame.

431
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,516
Right now we gotta find
a place to sleep, so relax. Come on.

432
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,991
Oh, hello, fellas.

433
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,793
Shut up.

434
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,797
- Couple of empties down there, fellas.
- Thanks, pal.

435
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,871
- First night's leave for you guys?
- Yeah.

436
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,314
Well, do you wanna talk?

437
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,789
Sure, but we got in trouble,
we picked up a kid.

438
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,673
Yeah, yeah,
and what a little kid that was.

439
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,997
And what another little kid she had
waiting for us when we got home.

440
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,720
Such trouble we should run into
every night of our life.

441
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,110
- Hiya, Joe.
- Hiya, Pittsburgh, how are you?

442
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,397
- Oh, boy, what a town this is.
- How do you like that?

443
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,712
I walk my feet off all night
and end up with a glass of beer.

444
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,274
You don't live right.

445
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,159
Oh, never in all my life
have I seen such dames.

446
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,594
This blond...

447
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,558
Not that there was anything wrong
with that redhead of yours.

448
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,750
Oh, no. No, no.
She was rather interesting.

449
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,798
Oh, interesting.
You should have seen the kid work.

450
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,153
- I'll tell you, we took the dames home.
- You took them home.

451
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,754
- Little slow at first. A little slow.
- Little slow.

452
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,717
I asked my girl for a kiss.

453
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,916
- She said no.
- Skip the details.

454
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,674
- What happened?
- Well, I'll tell you.

455
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,753
<i>I begged her</i>

456
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,558
That's the way he started.

457
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,474
<i>I pleaded</i>

458
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,234
You should have seen this boy.

459
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:22,157
<i>I told her,</i>
<i>"Baby, come out of your shell"</i>

460
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,600
<i>I told her,</i>
<i>"Maybe you'll find that it's swell"</i>

461
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,034
What technique.

462
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,351
<i>I argued</i>

463
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,795
I never saw such a stubborn dame
in my whole life.

464
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,839
<i>I threatened</i>

465
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,718
And he's got muscles, too.

466
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:47,037
<i>I said,</i>
<i>"You can 't send me home, not like this"</i>

467
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,115
<i>And I finally got that kiss</i>

468
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,311
Tell them, Brooklyn.
Tell them how it is.

469
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,031
<i>She begged me</i>

470
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,792
- True?
- True. True.

471
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,919
<i>She pleaded</i>

472
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,150
Got down on her bended knee to him!

473
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:11,757
<i>She told me,</i>
<i>"Baby, come out of your shell"</i>

474
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,990
Oh, this boy was sensational.

475
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,551
<i>She told me,</i>
<i>"Maybe you'll find that it's swell"</i>

476
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,836
- Tell them all, Brooklyn.
- I'm telling them.

477
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,436
<i>She argued</i>

478
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,477
What like a wildcat.

479
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,713
<i>She threatened</i>

480
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,916
Practically drew a gun on the boy.

481
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:38,074
<i>She said,</i>
<i>"You can 't send me home, not like this"</i>

482
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,514
What happened?

483
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,878
<i>She finally got her kiss</i>

484
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,839
- Look at this.
- Give them the floor, boys.

485
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,758
<i>What a time we had tonight</i>

486
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,349
<i>What a dish, what a dream</i>
<i>What a dame</i>

487
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,518
<i>And she lives alone</i>

488
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,798
What time is it?

489
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,030
Oh, it's early yet.

490
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,069
Yeah, I know, but what time is it?

491
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,232
What happened to that clock?

492
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,911
The phone! Where's the phone?

493
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,758
Hello. Hello, Lola. Listen, honey, l...
Well, then, who is it?

494
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,151
Oh, well, listen, this is Joe Brady.
Where's Lola?

495
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,670
Did she leave a message for me?

496
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,150
Never mind what you'd say!
What did Lola say?

497
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,393
Well, that's too bad
about you too, sister...!

498
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,993
Hey. Hey, don't hang up on me.

499
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,879
Let's leave a note, will you?
Tell her I'll call at 10...

500
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,271
Honest, Joe,
I can explain the whole thing.

501
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,112
Just give me a second,
I can explain.

502
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,113
You were sleeping like a baby,
and I didn't wanna disturb you.

503
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,159
I know you need your rest very badly.
I know you don't look good unless...

504
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,880
Joe, help! Help! Help!

505
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,439
Joe, help!

506
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,597
It's against the rules, really,
but we thought just this once...

507
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,557
...we ought to serve breakfast
up here.

508
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,995
After all,
you've been through so much.

509
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,919
Oh, thanks a lot.

510
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,275
You must appreciate
a buddy like Clarence.

511
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,193
Do you know he wouldn't let anyone
make a sound all morning?

512
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,439
We just crept around like little mice
so as not to wake you.

513
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,238
I never saw such devotion.

514
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,757
Oh, don't think I don't appreciate it.
And don't think I won't pay him back.

515
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,514
Oh, I'm sure Clarence
doesn't expect it.

516
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,592
Oh, no. Really, I don't. I'd hate it.

517
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,876
You poor, poor boy.

518
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,713
Forty-eight days and nights
on a raft.

519
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,194
Isn't this thrilling?

520
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,715
If you want any more coffee,
just let us know.

521
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,309
- And he looks so shy.
- I know, he's so sweet.

522
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,917
Joe. Joe, don't you think you ought
to eat some of this food?

523
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,718
It gets cold very quickly, you know.

524
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,950
Why don't you try the eggs.
They're very good.

525
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,759
Joe, I left you a razor in the shower,
there's a towel...

526
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,559
Clarence, you can wait on me
hand and foot.

527
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,188
You can polish my shoes,
you can be my slave.

528
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,758
But, Clarence...

529
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,551
...it won't do you any good.

530
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,110
Because I'm not going to help you
with Aunt Susan. Get it?

531
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,599
But, Joe...

532
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,796
Joe, it isn't Aunt Susan, it's Donald.

533
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,996
You promised him
you'd go back to see him.

534
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,230
Why, it's like breaking
the word of honor...

535
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,630
...of the whole United States Navy.

536
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,398
Clarence...

537
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,028
...I'm not going back to that house!

538
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,910
Look, I get you a date with her,
it washes us up.

539
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,832
I don't owe you a thing, right?

540
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,197
Okay. Here, take all this stuff.

541
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,430
It'll make an impression.

542
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,837
Let me look at you.

543
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,710
Well, it'll have to do.

544
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,917
Now, try, will you?

545
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,469
- Hello, Aunt Susie.
- Why...

546
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,632
Hello. Won't you come in?

547
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,793
We promised Donald
we'd come back and, well...

548
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,474
Brooklyn spent the whole afternoon
getting him toys.

549
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,790
Oh, that's awfully kind of you.

550
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,520
- Let's put them over here, huh?
- Where's he hiding?

551
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,069
Donald? Oh, he's down in school.

552
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,356
Thanks to you,
he went almost willingly today.

553
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,953
Oh, good.

554
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:19,113
Say, aren't you a little young
to be bringing up a kid all by yourself?

555
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,113
Well, I'm all the family he has.

556
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,352
His mother died when he was a baby,
and then his father.

557
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,678
His father left us this house,
and that helps quite a lot.

558
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,838
You see, I work,
and that keeps me...

559
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,070
...from being with Donald
as much as I'd like.

560
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,830
I never know when the studio
is going to call me.

561
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,595
- Gee, are you an actress?
- I wanna be a singer.

562
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,069
But right now
I'm doing extra work in the movies.

563
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,435
You ever get a chance
to do any singing?

564
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,637
No, but there are some
really great musicians.

565
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,554
There's Stokowski and José lturbi and
people like that who work in pictures.

566
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,712
There's always a chance that
I might get to sing for one of them.

567
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,996
- Any luck so far?
- No.

568
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,231
That's awful. That's terrible.

569
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,391
Thank you, Clarence.

570
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,553
Oh, I didn't realize it was so late.

571
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,599
Please forgive me, but I really
should run up and dress now.

572
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,348
I'm sorry you missed Donald,
he'll be disappointed.

573
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,479
Well, as a matter of fact, we didn't
come just to see Donald, we...

574
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,112
Clarence, I'm going to tell her
whether you like it or not.

575
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,356
Clarence didn't sleep all night,
you know.

576
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,637
And do you know why?
Because he was thinking about you.

577
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,313
Why, Clarence.

578
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,830
I told him that you'd understand
how it is, getting to a strange town...

579
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,479
...when you've been away at sea.

580
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,029
"She'll understand," I said,
"how important it is...

581
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,998
...when you finally do get
a little leave, to meet someone..."

582
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,312
Clarence, do you wanna take me out?
Is that what all this is leading up to?

583
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,552
- "She's a girl with a heart," I said...
- Well, I'd love to.

584
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,034
Honest?

585
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,711
I wish I could make it tonight,
but I'm busy.

586
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,554
- Boyfriend?
- Oh, no.

587
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,517
Just someone I met at the studio.

588
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,399
He should be here now,
so I really have to run up and dress.

589
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,755
You did mean what you said
about my calling you?

590
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,196
Well, of course. Any night that
you're free, you just give me a ring.

591
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,756
Goodbye.
And thank you again for Donald.

592
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,478
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

593
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,192
You know, I bet she's not so bad.

594
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,476
Gee, I'm glad you like her.

595
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,473
I didn't say I liked her,
I said she wasn't bad.

596
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,393
Yeah, but coming from you.

597
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,719
Well, I guess if Aunt Susie likes him,
he must be okay.

598
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,950
Gee, that's a nice car, isn't it?

599
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,714
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Aren't you even worried?

600
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,111
Once she goes out with him,
she'll turn up her nose at any place we...

601
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,872
I mean, that you could take her to.

602
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,112
Look, this means nothing to me,
I'm telling you for your own good.

603
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,953
Once she goes out with him,
brother, you're dead.

604
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,714
- Gee, you think so, Joe?
- Sure.

605
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:33,034
There isn't anything I can do about it.

606
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,157
Brooklyn, there's always something
you can do about everything.

607
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,719
Come on.

608
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,315
Did you want to see Ms. Abbott?

609
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,156
- She's upstairs dressing, I'll call her.
- Oh, I wouldn't do that, bud.

610
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,551
Susie hates to be bothered
when she's dressing.

611
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,870
Yeah, she hates it.

612
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,829
- Something wrong, jack?
- Oh, no. Nothing at all.

613
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,112
Well, then squat someplace, jack,
you're making me nervous.

614
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,472
My name is Bertram Kraler.

615
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,798
Bertram?

616
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,878
Are you good friends of Ms. Abbott's?

617
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,834
You might call it that.

618
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,908
- Are you?
- I just met her.

619
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,513
I'm taking her to dinner.

620
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,399
Maybe you know
what you're doing, Bertram...

621
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,358
...but I don't think
the boys will like it.

622
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,593
I beg your pardon? The boys?

623
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,673
The Navy. I don't think they're
gonna like Susie branching out this way.

624
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,957
But I don't quite...

625
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,270
Ms. Abbott knows
a great many Navy men?

626
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,994
Maybe some she doesn't know,
say a dozen or two maybe.

627
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,158
It's a funny thing.

628
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,591
You get onboard a new ship...

629
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,753
...don't know a soul,
kind of lonesome even.

630
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:45,994
Then at chow somebody says,
"Anybody seen Susie lately?"

631
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,628
And right away
everybody's talking about her.

632
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:52,118
You know, it's kind of homey,
if you see what I mean.

633
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:57,957
Yes. Yes, I do. But, well,
she seems such a quiet girl.

634
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,595
Susie? Quiet?

635
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,112
Well, that's not what the song says
when the boys sing about her.

636
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,157
They never even mention
the word "quiet."

637
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,880
They sing about her?
The Navy's got a song about her?

638
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,429
- Sure.
- I don't believe it.

639
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:22,071
- Well, okay.
- All right, let me hear it.

640
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:27,270
Well, I don't think you'd better, Bertram.
It's strictly for sailors, see?

641
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,317
Yeah. Yeah, it's not
your type of a song.

642
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,710
I insist on hearing it.

643
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,389
All right, Brooklyn,
if the man insists, let's play.

644
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,630
But, Joe, I don't think we ought to.

645
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,191
- Go ahead. Play that Susie song.
- Well, you start and I'll find you a key.

646
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,716
<i>If you knew Susie</i>
<i>Like we know Susie</i>

647
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,992
<i>Oh, oh, oh, what a gal!</i>

648
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,670
<i>She's not so choosy</i>
<i>No, not our Susie</i>

649
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,196
<i>- Oh, oh...</i>
<i>- Susie is a lollapaloozie</i>

650
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,916
<i>- When Susie kisses</i>
<i>- It never fails</i>

651
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,394
<i>When Susie kisses</i>

652
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,039
<i>She takes the wind</i>
<i>Right out of your sails</i>

653
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,112
<i>- So in conclusion</i>
<i>- Beware of Susion</i>

654
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,272
<i>Oh, oh, oh, what a gal!</i>

655
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,958
<i>S is for sincerity</i>

656
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,995
<i>Which she's got none of</i>

657
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:23,199
<i>U is for you-know-what-l-mean</i>

658
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,433
<i>- S is for...</i>
<i>- Sincerity</i>

659
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,673
<i>Which she's got none of</i>

660
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:36,153
<i>I is for the Irish in her smile</i>

661
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:44,435
<i>Her Irish smile</i>

662
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:49,551
<i>E is for her eagerness to please us</i>

663
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,631
<i>That is how she won her Navy E

664
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,275
<i>Put them all together</i>

665
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:00,838
<i>They spell Susie</i>

666
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,077
<i>The sweetheart of the boys at sea</i>

667
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,879
<i>Oh, that Susie</i>
<i>She's a doozy</i>

668
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,634
<i>She's not choosy</i>
<i>You won 't lose-y</i>

669
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,559
<i>- Don 't care who-sie</i>
<i>- I mean you-sie</i>

670
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,757
<i>You'll get woozy</i>
<i>After just one date with Susie</i>

671
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,036
<i>When you take her home about 10</i>

672
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,317
<i>Another gob is waiting there</i>
<i>To take our Susie out again</i>

673
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,914
<i>- So in conclusie</i>
<i>- Beware of Susie</i>

674
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,718
<i>She belongs to you and you and me</i>

675
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:26,869
<i>And the U.S. Navy</i>

676
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,469
<i>S, S-U, S-U-S</i>

677
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:35,636
<i>S- U-S-I, S-U-S-l-E</i>

678
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,591
Well, well, well.

679
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,399
I don't know what's the matter
with him, do you, Brooklyn?

680
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,879
Yes, and I wish I didn't.

681
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,679
Will you please tell Ms. Abbott
that Mr. Kraler regrets...

682
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,832
Regrets what?
What on earth is the matter?

683
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,755
What are you two doing here?

684
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,637
Mr. Kraler regrets what?

685
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,836
I'm afraid there's been
a misunderstanding.

686
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,117
Knowing your taste as I do now,
I'm sure the kind of evening...

687
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,998
...I'd planned wouldn't interest you.

688
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,232
S-U-S, S-U...

689
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,197
But, Mr. Kraler, l...

690
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,877
What did you say to him?

691
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,270
- What difference does it make?
- I'd like to know.

692
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,556
- What did you say to him?
- I kind of figured...

693
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,996
...you were stuck with him and...
It wasn't Brooklyn, really. It was me.

694
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,720
I don't understand why you think
I was stuck with him.

695
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,838
Well, I thought that you'd be glad
to get him off your hands.

696
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,390
- I thought you'd be grateful if l...
- And you thought I'd be grateful.

697
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,879
Well, yes, maybe, l...
I mean, if I were a dame and that...

698
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,709
If you were a dame and for one solid year
you'd been trying to get someplace...

699
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:45,316
...and you met a man whose mother
was in the philharmonic society...

700
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,153
...and who could introduce you
to very important people.

701
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,629
People like lturbi. I mean...

702
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,951
...I think this is the meanest
and the cruelest...

703
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,873
Don't cry. Please, don't cry.

704
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,472
Aunt Susie.

705
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,757
- Oh, go away.
- No.

706
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,272
I'm sorry. I had no right to brush
Bertram off without your okay.

707
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,512
Honest, I'm sorry. Please don't cry.

708
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,472
Oh, I know you didn't mean it...

709
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,315
...but it's just that
I might never get another chance.

710
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:33,155
We've got a better chance for you.
That is, Clarence has.

711
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,959
It's... Well, it's a surprise.

712
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,669
- Well, what kind of a surprise?
- Oh, he'd never tell you.

713
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,592
That's Clarence all over.

714
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,069
You know what he did
before he went into the Navy?

715
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,037
- He was the assistant...
- Joe!

716
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,792
Joe, remember
what you promised me.

717
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,390
Okay. At least I can tell her
you were in music, can't I?

718
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,118
And he was a big shot too.

719
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,874
Why, when you went upstairs
to change, he said to me:

720
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,508
"You know, if meeting lturbi
would do her any good...

721
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,752
...well, after all,
he's a friend of mine and..."

722
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,957
- He is, Clarence?
- They're pals.

723
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:08,112
As a matter of fact,
I once even heard lturbi say:

724
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,909
"It is I who should be grateful
to you, Clarence."

725
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,278
Remember? At San Diego?

726
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,755
Well, you know what Clarence did?

727
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:22,118
He just went to the phone
and called his pal lturbi...

728
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:26,398
...and arranged for you
to have an audition, that's all.

729
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,631
Oh, Clarence, you didn't.

730
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,110
Well, when...? When did he say?

731
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,760
- When?
- Go ahead, tell her when, Clarence.

732
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,319
Saturday. Saturday morning at 11: 15.

733
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,232
Oh, Clarence.

734
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,474
I'm sorry.

735
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:53,270
It's just that it's the nicest thing
that anyone has ever done for me and...

736
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,635
What did he say?
What did you tell him about me?

737
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,631
- What does he...?
- Look, I've got an idea.

738
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,074
No.

739
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,800
He has many things to tell you,
why don't you go out...

740
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,473
...have dinner and talk it over.

741
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:07,519
- I think that'd be a wonderful idea.
- Well, you come too.

742
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,954
- Please do, Joe.
- Look...

743
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,918
...you haven't got a thing to do
until 10:00, remember?

744
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,593
- Joe!
- Hiya, sailor.

745
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,354
You came! You came!

746
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,829
Don't tell me you've been
at school all this time?

747
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,154
Sure, I stayed to tell the teacher
what I had to study for the Navy.

748
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,197
She sure doesn't know much.

749
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,271
You mean you kept the teacher
until now?

750
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,829
- Of course. Hiya, Clarence.
- Hiya, Donald.

751
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,309
Come on, I'm gonna march you
over to Mrs. Murphy's.

752
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:34,959
- We're going out.
- I'll come too.

753
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,588
- Oh, no, you won't.
- But I gotta talk to Joe.

754
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,591
You can just talk to Joe
some other time.

755
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,194
- When? Tomorrow?
- Sure. Sure.

756
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,912
Will you come in school to see me?

757
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:48,154
- Aunt Susie is coming tomorrow.
- Okay, it's a promise.

758
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,151
Come along, darling.

759
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,754
Hey, you dope.
You wanted a date with her, didn't you?

760
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,480
Wanted to be alone?
What do you wanna drag me along for?

761
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:01,315
Because I don't know
what lturbi said to me on the phone.

762
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,313
It's a wishing well.

763
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,313
Every time I pass by,
I always toss a coin in and make a wish.

764
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,676
Thanks to you, I got my wish.

765
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:57,274
Oh, but should I still toss a coin in?

766
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,117
You better play it safe.

767
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,359
Now it's your turn.

768
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:17,229
No, no, not me. I got a theory called
"Wishing Don't Make It So."

769
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,352
You decide what you want
and then you go out and get it.

770
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,431
Come on.

771
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,670
- Oh, no, not again enchiladas.
- What else?

772
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,149
Enchiladas for all of us
and all the trimmings.

773
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,918
All right.

774
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:38,119
- Now, listen, gentlemen, this is on me.
- But you can't spend your money on us.

775
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,396
- I'm not.
- What are you gonna do? Wash dishes?

776
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,516
- Polish the silver?
- Scrub the floors?

777
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:46,275
That sounds reasonable.
Now, listen, you stay right here...

778
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,000
...and no matter what happens,
be brave.

779
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,314
- You're all set, I'm gonna go.
- You can't leave me alone.

780
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,710
How are you gonna get to know her
if you're never alone with her?

781
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,711
Besides, I wanna phone Lola.

782
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,552
We have Ms. Susan Abbott
to sing for you.

783
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,030
<i>Jealousy</i>

784
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,636
<i>You constantly hurt me</i>

785
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,190
<i>I sometimes wonder</i>

786
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:42,273
<i>If this spell that I'm under</i>

787
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:46,069
<i>Can only be a melody</i>

788
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,670
<i>For I know no one but me</i>

789
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,952
<i>Has won your heart</i>

790
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:58,509
<i>But when the music starts</i>

791
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,950
<i>My peace departs</i>

792
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:06,917
<i>From the moment they play</i>
<i>That languorous strain</i>

793
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:10,197
<i>And we surrender</i>

794
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:14,114
<i>To all its charm once again</i>

795
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:17,232
<i>This jealousy</i>

796
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:21,316
<i>That tortures me</i>

797
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,069
<i>Is ecstasy</i>

798
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:30,439
<i>Mysterious pain</i>

799
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:36,510
<i>We dance to a tango of love</i>

800
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:43,355
<i>Your heart beats with mine</i>
<i>As we sway</i>

801
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:49,352
<i>Your eyes give the answer</i>
<i>I'm dreaming of</i>

802
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:53,909
<i>That soft word</i>
<i>Your cruel lips</i>

803
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:58,790
<i>Will never say</i>

804
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,757
<i>I fear that the music will end</i>

805
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:11,475
<i>And shatter the spell it may lend</i>

806
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,071
<i>To make me believe</i>

807
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,159
<i>When your eyes just deceive</i>

808
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:25,959
<i>And it's only the tango you love</i>

809
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,913
<i>To make me believe</i>

810
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:52,710
<i>When your eyes just deceive</i>

811
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:57,948
<i>And it's only the tango</i>

812
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:04,759
<i>You love</i>

813
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:16,633
- Where is the phone?
- Oh, right up here.

814
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,359
Gee, I thought
you were wonderful, honest.

815
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,353
Joe went to make a phone call.

816
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,437
- He's a busy guy.
- He is?

817
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,556
He's the biggest wolf
in the whole Navy.

818
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,228
Yeah, they call him the sea wolf.

819
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,394
Well, that's what they call him.

820
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:37,798
Clarence, do you realize
that I don't know anything about you?

821
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,918
I mean, other than you're very nice...

822
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,717
...but tell me about yourself.

823
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,317
I'm fine.

824
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:51,397
Well, what sort of work
do you do in the Navy?

825
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,515
- Gun crew.
- Is it interesting?

826
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,871
It's keen.

827
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,508
- Well, we missed you.
- Susita...

828
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:20,116
...it was not bad this time.
It was great.

829
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,918
Well, I have wonderful news for you.

830
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:25,476
Guess for whom I'm going to sing
this Saturday morning at 11: 15.

831
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:29,156
José lturbi. The José lturbi.

832
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,469
- No.
- Yes.

833
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:36,275
Clarence is one of his best friends,
and he arranged it for me.

834
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,359
Wait, I must run. I must tell Mama.
I must tell Pedro. I must tell Manuel.

835
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,909
- I must tell everybody.
- But it's only an audition...

836
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:46,271
It's no use,
it'll be all over the street in five minutes.

837
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,356
Susan, you think
you ought to tell people?

838
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,112
I know you have a wonderful voice...

839
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,794
Yeah, but what if everything
didn't go just right?

840
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,515
Well, you've given me the opportunity,
and I want everyone to know about it.

841
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:03,316
If I fail, it's... Well, it's right
that they should know that too.

842
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,948
Yeah, I guess she's right.

843
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,711
Say, Clarence,
why don't you dance with Susan.

844
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:15,355
Sure. Do you wanna?
I mean, I'd like to if you'd like to.

845
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,794
I'd love to.

846
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,196
I only know how to waltz...

847
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,473
...and this isn't a...

848
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:36,628
Well, that's too bad.
Maybe they'll play one later on.

849
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:57,757
You know, you're a strange team,
you two.

850
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:01,037
Clarence is so shy...

851
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,912
...and you're so...

852
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:07,909
Well, you're a sea wolf.
Clarence told me you were.

853
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:16,757
Yeah, well,
dames are plenty crazy about him.

854
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,479
Nice dames, that is.

855
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,837
And not about you?
Nice dames, that is.

856
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,993
Well, I'm an altogether different
kind of a guy. You know, l...

857
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:29,072
Well, I'm never serious about things...

858
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:32,073
...but, well, Clarence,
he's always on the level.

859
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:41,679
All right, all right,
I know I should have tried, but I didn't.

860
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,515
Okay, so I'm a coward.

861
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:50,397
I don't know why, you tell me.

862
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,990
Gee whiz, why do I freeze
when she looks at me?

863
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:58,278
What makes people act this way
about people?

864
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,831
What makes anything?

865
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:06,509
<i>What makes the sun set?</i>

866
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:10,116
<i>What makes the moon rise?</i>

867
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:13,630
<i>What makes the tide</i>
<i>Remember to hide</i>

868
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:17,031
<i>And why does it soon rise?</i>

869
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:21,516
<i>What makes a star fall?</i>

870
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,792
<i>Where does it fall to?</i>

871
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:29,193
<i>Why does its flight</i>
<i>Make us stop in the night</i>

872
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:32,672
<i>And wish as we all do?</i>

873
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:40,988
<i>And what holds a cloud together?</i>

874
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:49,633
<i>What makes the sky so blue?</i>

875
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:53,989
<i>What makes the sun set?</i>

876
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,630
<i>What makes the moon rise?</i>

877
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:01,389
<i>Is it my love</i>

878
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,515
<i>For you?</i>

879
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:18,198
<i>And what holds a cloud together?</i>

880
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:25,950
<i>And what makes the sky so blue?</i>

881
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:31,429
<i>What makes the sun set?</i>

882
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,231
<i>What makes the moon rise?</i>

883
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,637
<i>Is it my love</i>

884
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:45,593
<i>For you?</i>

885
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,833
Gee, you sing just like a bird.

886
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,828
- Brooklyn!
- Yeah, how do you know?

887
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:05,589
- Flatbush.
- Go on. Greenpoint.

888
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,710
- How do you like that?
- How do you like that?

889
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,633
Lmagine meeting a dame
all the way from Brooklyn.

890
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:14,991
Ain't it a small world?
Like my old lady used to say.

891
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:19,234
Hey, mister, you better sit down, huh?
The manager.

892
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:24,470
- Gee, are you all alone?
- No, I'm here with a girl. She's dancing.

893
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,069
Oh, he's my best friend.

894
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,198
Okay, maybe you know
what you're doing.

895
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:39,991
She's a swell one, all right, that girl.
And what a voice.

896
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,675
Yeah, she's wonderful.

897
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,269
She's just about the loveliest...

898
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:48,517
Only, you know something?
I can never talk to her.

899
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,399
I can never talk to girls at all.
I never know what to say.

900
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:54,358
What's the matter with you?
You're talking to me, ain't you?

901
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:56,078
Oh, you...

902
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:59,073
Oh, I mean... I mean, you're different.
You're from Brooklyn.

903
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:02,278
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

904
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:07,478
Most girls are so easy
to figure out, see?

905
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:11,633
- They are?
- Yeah, but you are...

906
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:15,557
One time you look kind of as if
you knew all the answers...

907
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:19,514
...and then 10 minutes later
you're just like a little kid.

908
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:22,758
Just when a guy starts thinking
he ought to buy you a doll...

909
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,876
...or an ice cream cone
or something...

910
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:28,915
...then all of a sudden
you're all grown up again.

911
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:31,752
I am?

912
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,153
Yeah.

913
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:40,588
And everything gets all kind of
mixed up and interesting.

914
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:48,838
I mean... Well, that's what Clarence
said about you.

915
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,992
You know,
he thinks about you all the time.

916
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:53,918
He does?

917
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:56,953
Yeah.

918
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,633
Yeah.

919
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,438
All the time.

920
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:31,477
I guess I'll be seeing you again
tomorrow night at the restaurant?

921
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:36,509
- Lf you don't mind going back there.
- Oh, I don't mind. It's a swell place.

922
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,553
Well.

923
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,438
Well.

924
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:45,635
It's been a lovely evening...

925
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:48,673
...and I don't know when
I've been so happy.

926
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:57,358
Good night.

927
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:05,512
Joe, did you hear what she said?
She's never been so happy.

928
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,796
Yeah, and if you stop to think
for a minute...

929
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:10,190
...maybe you'll figure out why.

930
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,270
- You mean lturbi?
- Yeah.

931
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,352
Why shouldn't she be happy,
with that big, beautiful audition...

932
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:19,794
...you fixed coming up?

933
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:48,558
<i>All of a sudden my heart sings</i>

934
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:52,588
<i>When I remember little things</i>

935
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,589
<i>The way you dance</i>
<i>And hold me tight</i>

936
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:01,635
<i>The way you kiss</i>
<i>And say good night</i>

937
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:06,038
<i>The crazy things we say and do</i>

938
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:09,949
<i>How fun it is to be with you</i>

939
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:15,674
<i>The magic thrill</i>
<i>That's in your touch</i>

940
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:21,273
<i>Oh, darling, I love you so much</i>

941
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:25,912
<i>The secret way you press my hand</i>

942
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:30,676
<i>To let me know you understand</i>

943
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:35,237
<i>The wind and rain upon your face</i>

944
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:41,033
<i>The breathless world</i>
<i>Of your embrace</i>

945
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:46,394
<i>Your little laugh and half-surprise</i>

946
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:52,792
<i>The starlight gleaming in your eyes</i>

947
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:58,830
<i>Remembering all those little things</i>

948
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,593
<i>All of a sudden</i>

949
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:08,839
<i>My heart sings</i>

950
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:24,119
Yes, Mr. Banick, I understand.

951
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:28,313
You've gotta have a pass
to get in, sailor.

952
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:33,390
I'll take care of that right away,
Mr. Banick. Yes, sir.

953
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:40,638
- Mr. Iturbi work here?
- Yes.

954
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:44,515
- Well, I'd kind of like to see him.
- Is Mr. Iturbi expecting you?

955
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:48,310
- Well, not exactly.
- Well, I'm sorry, but it's impossible.

956
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:56,670
I gotta talk to him. It's important.
Even just for a minute, can't you?

957
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:00,469
Really, there's nothing I can do. He's
very busy. He's on the stage, recording.

958
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,389
Gentlemen, bar 95, please.

959
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:08,598
- Roll it, Jim, please.
- Speed.

960
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:47,830
So the admiral went up on deck,
said to him, he said, "Gunner's Mate...

961
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,833
...Second Class Joe Brady,
what do you think we should do?"

962
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,112
So Joe said, "Well, sir..."
Because even in a battle...

963
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:56,669
...if you talk to an admiral,
you have to say "sir."

964
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:00,276
So Joe said...
Joe! Come on, kids, it's Joe.

965
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:01,714
Hi.

966
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:05,429
- I was just telling them about you.
- Yeah, so I heard.

967
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:08,677
- Where's Aunt Susie? I thought she...
- She had to go to the studio.

968
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:12,958
Listen, Joe, I told the kids you'd tell us
all about your adventures.

969
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,674
Oh, look, l... Honest...

970
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,836
All right, all right.
Sit down, sit down.

971
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,877
Oh, boy.

972
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:26,549
Tell us how you got your medal.

973
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:29,754
All right,
I'll tell you how I got my medal.

974
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,752
Now, close your eyes...

975
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:36,833
...and try to imagine the most
beautiful day you've ever seen.
