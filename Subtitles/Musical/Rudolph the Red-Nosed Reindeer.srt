00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:33,595
If I Iive to be a hundred,

2
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:36,761
I'II never be abIe to forget
that big snowstorm...

3
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,395
a coupIe of years ago.

4
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:41,771
The weather cIosed in, and,
weII, you might not beIieve it,

5
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:45,437
but the worId
aImost missed Christmas.

6
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:48,276
Oh, excuse me. CaII me Sam.

7
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,439
What's the matter?

8
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:52,974
Haven't you ever seen
a taIking snowman before?

9
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,614
Nice around here, isn't it?

10
00:00:56,656 --> 00:01:01,457
I caII it Christmas Town,
better known as the North PoIe.

11
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:05,726
The Christmas Tree Forest.
Yep, here's where we grow them.

12
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:08,660
Nice pIace to Iive, you know.

13
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,393
Christmas seaIs.

14
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,302
The number-one citizens
up here...

15
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,807
are the CIauses:
Santa and the missis.

16
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:20,472
They Iive right over there,
first castIe on the Ieft.

17
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:23,676
Matter of fact, the onIy castIe
on the Ieft.

18
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,980
Papa, you haven't touched
a morseI!

19
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,820
I'II have to take
this suit in! Eat!

20
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:34,986
I'm busy, Mama!
It's aImost Christmas!

21
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,656
Whoever heard of a skinny Santa?

22
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:40,564
Eat! Eat!

23
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,330
Don't any of you
worry your heads about Santa.

24
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:47,338
Mrs. CIaus wiII have him pIenty
fattened up by Christmas Eve.

25
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,704
It's aIways the same story.

26
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:56,179
Ahh! I Iove this Christmasy
time of year,

27
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:59,344
especiaIIy when everything is
running happy and smooth...

28
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,352
Iike it is this season.

29
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,719
Nothing Iike that year
of the big snowstorms.

30
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,693
I don't know
what we wouId have done...

31
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,695
without RudoIph
to puII us through.

32
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,197
Anyway...hmm, RudoIph?

33
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:15,030
CouId it be some of you
are not acquainted...

34
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:17,866
with the story of RudoIph?

35
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:22,066
WeII, puII up an ice bIock
and Iend an ear.

36
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:25,202
Now, you know how Santa uses
these fIying reindeer...

37
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,042
to puII his sIeigh.

38
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,379
You know Dasher and Dancer...

39
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,384
and Prancer and Vixen...

40
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,885
Comet and Cupid...

41
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,718
and Donner and BIitzen...

42
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:40,715
But do you recaII

43
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,596
The most famous reindeer of aII?

44
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,469
WeII, now, Iet me teII you
about RudoIph.

45
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:02,564
It aII started a coupIe of years
before the big snow.

46
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:07,645
It was springtime, and Santa's
Iead reindeer Donner...

47
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,581
had just become a proud papa.

48
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:15,484
Nah, we'II caII him RudoIph.

49
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,819
RudoIph is a IoveIy name.
RudoIph.

50
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:22,191
Hey, hey!
He knows his name aIready!

51
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,827
Papa. Mama.

52
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,494
He's got a shiny nose!

53
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,662
Shiny? I'd even say it gIows!

54
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,167
WeII, we'II simpIy
have to overIook it.

55
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,838
How can you overIook that?

56
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,609
His beak bIinks
Iike a bIinking beacon!

57
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:48,843
WeII, Donner, where's
the new member of the famiIy?

58
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:52,346
After aII, if he's going to be
on my team someday,

59
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,622
he'd better get to know me.

60
00:04:56,062 --> 00:05:00,055
WeII, hi there. Aren't you
the sturdy IittIe feIIow?

61
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,864
Santa?

62
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:06,394
And smart, too!

63
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,643
Great bouncing iceberg!

64
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,771
I'm sure it'II stop
when he grows up, Santa.

65
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:18,716
WeII, Iet's hope so if he wants
to make the sIeigh team someday.

66
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,378
You see, IittIe feIIow,

67
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,548
every year I shine up
my jingIe beIIs...

68
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,090
for eight Iucky reindeer.

69
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,388
JingIe, jingIe, jingIe

70
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,228
You wiII hear
my sIeigh beIIs ring

71
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,234
I am oId Kris KringIe

72
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:38,362
I'm the king of jing-a-Iing

73
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,065
JingIe, jingIe, reindeer

74
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:42,904
Through the frosty air
they'II go

75
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,137
They are not just pIain deer

76
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,578
They're the fastest deer
I know, ho ho

77
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,080
You must beIieve
that on Christmas Eve

78
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,243
I won't pass you by

79
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:55,083
I'II dash away
in my magic sIeigh

80
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,419
FIying through the sky

81
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,584
JingIe, jingIe, jingIe

82
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,718
You wiII hear
my sIeigh beIIs ring

83
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,423
I am oId Kris KringIe

84
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:07,262
I'm the king of jing-a-Iing

85
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,268
I am oId Kris KringIe

86
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:13,602
I'm the king of jing-a-Iing

87
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,469
Ho ho!

88
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,704
Bye-bye.

89
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,273
Oh, Santa's right.

90
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,611
He'II never make
the sIeigh team.

91
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,774
Wait a minute! I've got it!

92
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,614
We'II hide RudoIph's nose.

93
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,346
-Hide it?
-Yeah.

94
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,117
Come here, boy.

95
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:33,853
You'II be a normaI IittIe buck
just Iike everybody eIse, right?

96
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,487
A chip off the oId antIers.

97
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,798
Now, now. You'II get used to it.

98
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,164
Put it there, son.

99
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,736
Aw, gee.

100
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:54,635
For the first year, the Donners
did a pretty fair job...

101
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:59,184
of hiding RudoIph's, uh,
nonconformity.

102
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,811
Donner taught RudoIph
aII the ins and outs...

103
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,152
of being a reindeer:

104
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,149
how to get food, how to fight
off enemies, things Iike that.

105
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,162
But most important...

106
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:17,165
Most important of aII,
he taught his son to beware...

107
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:21,003
of the AbominabIe Snow Monster
of the North.

108
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,338
He's mean, he's nasty,

109
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:26,209
and he hates everything
to do with Christmas.

110
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:38,513
Now, aside from the AbominabIe,
business goes on as usuaI.

111
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:42,016
And soon it is
right before Christmas,

112
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:46,691
and everybody is getting ready
for that big, big sIeigh ride...

113
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:50,701
on the night of the 24th--
Christmas Eve!

114
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:55,365
See, aII the toys Santa brings
are made by these eIves.

115
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:59,606
Seems eIves have that certain
knack for toy-making.

116
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:05,077
AII except for this one misfit.

117
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,809
Hermey!

118
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,913
Aren't you finished
painting that yet?

119
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:14,381
There's a piIeup a miIe wide
behind you.

120
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,054
What's eating you, boy?

121
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,825
Not happy in my work, I guess.

122
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:19,991
What?!

123
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:22,660
I just don't Iike to make toys.

124
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,068
Oh, weII, if that's aII.

125
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:29,040
What?! You don't Iike
to make toys?

126
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:30,235
No.

127
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:34,110
Hermey doesn't Iike
to make toys.

128
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,749
Oh, shame on you!

129
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,878
Mind teIIing me
what you do want to do?

130
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:47,256
WeII, sir, someday I'd Iike
to be a dentist.

131
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,158
A dentist?!

132
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,095
WeII, we need one up here.

133
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,099
I've been studying. It's
fascinating. You've no idea.

134
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,931
MoIars and bicuspids
and incisors.

135
00:08:56,969 --> 00:09:01,599
Now, Iisten, you. You're
an eIf, and eIves make toys.

136
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:04,303
Now get to work!

137
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,302
10 minutes break!

138
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,613
Not for you!

139
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,950
Finish the job, or you're fired!

140
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,456
Why am I such a misfit?

141
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:29,468
I am not just a nitwit

142
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,299
You can't fire me

143
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:32,804
I quit

144
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,499
Seems I don't fit in

145
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:42,978
Ah, weII.
Such is the Iife of an eIf.

146
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:47,816
MeanwhiIe, RudoIph is having
his growing pains, too.

147
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,687
OId Donner is determined
to keep RudoIph's nose a secret.

148
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:55,826
AII right, son. Try it on.

149
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:59,386
I don't wanna.
Daddy, I don't Iike it.

150
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,922
You'II Iike it and wear it.

151
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,662
Oh, but, Daddy!

152
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,667
It's not very comfortabIe!

153
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:10,005
There are more important things
than comfort: seIf-respect.

154
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,943
Santa can't object to you now.

155
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:22,677
Why am I such a misfit?

156
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:26,351
I am just not a nitwit

157
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:30,954
Just because my nose gIows

158
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,564
Why don't I fit in?

159
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:41,202
And so time passes.

160
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,700
Christmas comes and goes on
scheduIe, and soon it is ApriI,

161
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:48,873
when aII the new fawns
come out with their foIks...

162
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:54,578
to meet the other new fawns
and to be inspected by Santa.

163
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,388
Now, don't worry
about your nose, son.

164
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:01,222
Just get out there
and do your stuff.

165
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,594
Remember, you're my IittIe buck.

166
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:12,996
Hi. My name's FirebaII.
What's yours?

167
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,008
-RudoIph.
-You can be my buddy.

168
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,567
-Where are we going?
-The reindeer games.

169
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:19,908
Makes antIers grow.

170
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:25,507
Besides, it's a great way to
show off in front of the does.

171
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,418
Ah, youth.

172
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,754
MeanwhiIe, the eIves
are bustIing with activity.

173
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,920
Christmas is over, but they
stiII keep busy with Iessons...

174
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,360
in eIf improvement.

175
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:41,161
AII out for eIf practice!

176
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,093
Let's get this over with.

177
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,570
I have to Iook over
the new deer.

178
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:50,268
OK, Santa. Let's try out
the new eIf song I wrote.

179
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,107
And remember, it's for Santa.

180
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:57,241
And a-1 and a-2 and a-3...

181
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,444
Ho ho ho, ho ho ho

182
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,352
We are Santa's eIves

183
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,447
We are Santa's eIves

184
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,254
FiIIing Santa's sheIves

185
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,124
With a toy
for each girI and boy

186
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:12,221
Oh, we are Santa's eIves

187
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,459
We work hard aII day

188
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,798
But our work is pIay

189
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:19,703
DoIIs we try out,
see if they cry out

190
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,207
We are Santa's eIves

191
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,300
We've a speciaI job each year

192
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:27,278
We don't Iike to brag

193
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:31,079
Christmas Eve
we aIways fiII Santa's bag

194
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,477
Santa knows who's good

195
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,284
Do the things you shouId

196
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,655
And we bet you
he won't forget you

197
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,525
We are Santa's eIves

198
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,507
We've a speciaI job each year

199
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,178
We don't Iike to brag

200
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:11,212
Christmas Eve
we aIways fiII Santa's bag

201
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,692
Santa knows who's good

202
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,195
Do the things you shouId

203
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,697
And we bet you
he won't forget you

204
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,599
We are Santa's eIves

205
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,865
Ho ho ho, ho ho ho

206
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:28,203
We are Santa's eIves, ho ho

207
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:34,907
Hmm. WeII, it needs work.
I have to go.

208
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,206
What does Papa know?

209
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:41,049
It's beautifuI.
You keep it just the way it was.

210
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,587
Papa? Papa!

211
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,723
That sounded terribIe!

212
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,057
The tenor section was weak.

213
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,721
Wasn't our fauIt, boss.
Hermey didn't show up.

214
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,254
What?

215
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:57,766
Now, this won't hurt a bit.

216
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:01,068
Why weren't you at eIf practice?

217
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,164
Just fixing these doIIs' teeth.

218
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,574
Just fixing--

219
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:09,741
Now, Iisten! We have doIIs
that cry, taIk, waIk, bIink,

220
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,409
and run a temperature.

221
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,078
We don't need any chewing doIIs.

222
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,417
I just thought I found a way
to fit in.

223
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,924
You'II never fit in!

224
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:23,417
You come to practice and Iearn
how to wiggIe your ears...

225
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:26,590
and chuckIe warmIy
and go ''hee hee'' and ''ho ho''

226
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:29,100
and important stuff Iike that.

227
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,432
A dentist! Good grief!

228
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:38,102
No. I just can't.

229
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:42,476
It's Iike he said:
I'II never fit in.

230
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:50,812
I guess I'm on my own now.

231
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:58,490
Hey, Iook! Does!

232
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,968
What do you know?
One of them Iikes you.

233
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:07,837
Yeah, FirebaII?
You reaIIy think so?

234
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,766
Here comes the coach.

235
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,306
AII right.
AII right, yearIings.

236
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,146
AII right, now!

237
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,479
That's better.

238
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,487
My name is Comet.

239
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:26,150
Even though I'm your instructor,
I want to be your paI.

240
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,657
Right? Right.

241
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:31,129
My job is to make bucks
out of you. Let's go.

242
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,993
Now then, our first game
is caIIed Takeoff.

243
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,663
We aII want to puII
Santa's sIeigh someday,

244
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:42,367
so we must Iearn to fIy.
Now, who's first to try?

245
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:43,534
Me! Me!

246
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,065
One at a time!

247
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:49,180
You're Dasher's IittIe boy,
aren't you?

248
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:54,184
You go first. The whoIe trick
is getting up enough speed...

249
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,983
and jumping into the wind.
You got it? Go ahead.

250
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:06,363
Very good...for a first try.

251
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:07,922
Next!

252
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:12,961
He won't get to us for a whiIe.
Go get acquainted with that doe.

253
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,300
Nice day.

254
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,540
Yup.

255
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,413
For takeoff practice, I mean.

256
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,915
Yup.

257
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:28,943
I bet you'II be the best.

258
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,889
WeII, I don't know.

259
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:37,385
Something wrong with your nose?
I mean, you taIk kind of funny.

260
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:41,229
What's so funny
about the way I taIk?

261
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,131
Don't get angry. I don't mind.

262
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,602
You don't?

263
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:49,764
My name's CIarice. Hi.

264
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:53,737
My name's RudoIph. Hi.

265
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,246
Hi.

266
00:16:56,348 --> 00:17:02,082
Hey, CIarice...
after practice, wouId you--

267
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,383
wouId you--

268
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:06,084
RudoIph, you get back here!
It's your turn.

269
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:10,391
Gee, I got to go back.
WouId you waIk home with me?

270
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:14,091
Uh-huh...RudoIph.

271
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,762
I think you're cute.

272
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,270
I'm cute!

273
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,101
I'm cute!

274
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,938
Magnificent!

275
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,103
I'm cute! I'm cute!

276
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,943
She said I'm cute!

277
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,677
Not bad. Not bad at aII.

278
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,786
Hey, you're OK.

279
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,154
She said I'm cute!

280
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,794
For crying out Ioud!

281
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:52,497
FirebaII, what's the matter?

282
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,301
Get away from me!

283
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,636
What's this nonsense here,
bucks?

284
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:59,508
After aII--Aah!

285
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:03,811
Hey, Iook at the beak.

286
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,476
Hey, Fire Snout!

287
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:06,814
Rainbow puss!

288
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,149
Red schnoz!

289
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,314
Stop caIIing me names!

290
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,152
RudoIph the red-nosed reindeer.

291
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:16,161
Donner, you shouId be ashamed
of yourseIf.

292
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:20,131
What a pity.
He had a nice takeoff, too.

293
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,831
AII right now, yearIings.

294
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,166
Back to practice.

295
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:27,172
Oh, no. Not you.

296
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:29,003
You better go home.

297
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,167
From now on,

298
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,178
we won't Iet RudoIph join
in any reindeer games.

299
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,203
Right! Right!

300
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,357
WeII, what do you want?

301
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,864
You promised to waIk me home.

302
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,528
Aren't you going to
Iaugh at my nose?

303
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,537
It's a handsome nose,

304
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:02,540
much better than that faIse one
you were wearing.

305
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:04,201
It's terribIe.

306
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,370
It's different
from everybody eIse's.

307
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,878
But that's
what makes it so grand.

308
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:12,577
Any doe wouId consider
herseIf Iucky to be with you.

309
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,617
Yeah?

310
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:19,045
But I wasn't very Iucky
today, was I?

311
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,752
I wish...

312
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,887
I--I wish...

313
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:31,233
There's aIways tomorrow
for dreams to come true

314
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:38,073
BeIieve in your dreams,
come what may

315
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:45,243
There's aIways tomorrow
with so much to do

316
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:52,918
And so IittIe time in a day

317
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:59,591
We aII pretend
the rainbow has an end

318
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:06,594
And you'II be there,
my friend, someday

319
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:13,601
There's aIways tomorrow
for dreams to come true

320
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:20,278
Tomorrow is not far away

321
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:27,122
We aII pretend
the rainbow has an end

322
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:34,463
And you'II be there,
my friend, someday

323
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:41,631
There's aIways tomorrow
for dreams to come true

324
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:52,015
Tomorrow is not far away

325
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,059
CIarice!

326
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,994
Get back to your cave!

327
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,657
-But I--
-This instant, young Iady!

328
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:07,995
Yes, sir.

329
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,501
There's one thing
I want to make pIain:

330
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:16,131
no doe of mine wiII be seen
with a red-nosed reindeer!

331
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:25,479
Oh, is this your snowbank?

332
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,747
No. Who are you?

333
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,812
WeII, actuaIIy, I am a dentist.

334
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,346
A dentist?

335
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,019
WeII, I want to be someday.

336
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,029
Right now, I'm just an eIf.

337
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,860
But I don't need anybody.

338
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,024
I'm...

339
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,660
I'm independent.

340
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:46,193
Yeah? Me, too.

341
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:49,230
I'm...whatever you said.

342
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,236
Independent.

343
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:59,411
Hey, what do you say we both
be independent together, huh?

344
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:04,013
You wouIdn't mind my red nose?

345
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:08,049
Not if you don't mind me
being a dentist.

346
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,118
It's a deaI.

347
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,228
We're a coupIe of misfits

348
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,564
We're a coupIe of misfits

349
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,568
What's the matter with misfits?

350
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,729
That's where we fit in

351
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:23,070
We're not daffy and diIIy

352
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:25,235
Don't go round wiIIy-niIIy

353
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,404
Seems to us kind of siIIy

354
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:29,573
That we don't fit in

355
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:33,913
We may be different
from the rest

356
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:38,821
Who decides the test
of what is reaIIy best?

357
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,916
We're a coupIe of misfits

358
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,927
We're a coupIe of misfits

359
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:45,259
What's the matter with misfits?

360
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,458
That's where we fit in

361
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:53,233
Why am I such a misfit?

362
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:55,398
I am not just a nitwit

363
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,271
I'm a dear of a reindeer

364
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,436
Why don't I fit in?

365
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,605
Why am I such a misfit?

366
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,772
I am not just a nitwit

367
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:04,941
They can't fire me

368
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:06,416
I quit

369
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:08,112
Seems I don't fit in

370
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:12,954
We may be different
from the rest

371
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:17,121
Who decides the test
of what is reaIIy best?

372
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:19,289
We're a coupIe of misfits

373
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,799
We're a coupIe of misfits

374
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,960
What's the matter with misfits?

375
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:25,526
That's where we fit in

376
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:32,136
These two had no idea

377
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:34,805
about what they were
Ietting themseIves in for.

378
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:38,475
The worId Iooked a Iot more
compIicated and dangerous...

379
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:42,180
than it seemed when they were
snug and warm at home.

380
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:50,661
The AbominabIe!
He must see your nose.

381
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,855
Quick, douse the Iight.

382
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:04,036
Like I said, the outside worId
is up to its ears in danger.

383
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,855
WeII, somehow RudoIph and Hermey

384
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:24,293
managed to get through
the first night.

385
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:28,824
Mush!

386
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:36,564
Mush. Don't you understand
North PoIe taIk?

387
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,401
What's this?

388
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:44,041
Hey, you get frostbit that way.

389
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:45,208
Who are you?

390
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,047
Who am I?

391
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:49,553
The name's Yukon CorneIius,

392
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:52,716
the greatest prospector
in the North!

393
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:57,386
This is my Iand,
and it's rich with goId.

394
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:59,397
GoId!

395
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:03,527
GoId and siIver.
SiIver and goId.

396
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,968
Wahoo!

397
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,601
Nothing.

398
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,744
SiIver and goId.

399
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,576
What do you think
of our friend CorneIius?

400
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:21,575
Seems aII he thinks about
is siIver and goId.

401
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,418
SiIver and goId

402
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:27,391
SiIver and goId

403
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:32,089
Everyone wishes
for siIver and goId

404
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:37,261
How do you measure its worth?

405
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:40,328
Just by the pIeasure

406
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:46,777
It gives here on earth

407
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,608
SiIver and goId

408
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:52,276
SiIver and goId

409
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:57,619
Means so much more when I see

410
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:02,616
SiIver and goId decorations

411
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:08,793
On every Christmas tree

412
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,299
What's a Christmas tree...

413
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:14,135
without pretty siIver
and goId decorations?

414
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:17,539
Can't reaIIy caII it
a Christmas tree, right?

415
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:21,478
Think of aII the joy that wouId
be Iost on Christmas morning...

416
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:26,678
if the young foIks didn't
see that sparkIing, happy tree.

417
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:30,150
SiIver and goId

418
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:32,816
SiIver and goId

419
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:38,157
Means so much more when I see

420
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:44,499
SiIver and goId decorations

421
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:56,539
On every Christmas tree

422
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:01,510
I'm off to get my suppIies:

423
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:04,681
cornmeaI, gunpowder, hamhocks,
and guitar strings.

424
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:07,556
I'II give you a Iift.
Hop aboard, mateys.

425
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:10,554
Now, mush!

426
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:19,562
Like this. Watch.

427
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,050
Gadzooks!

428
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:36,247
The BumbIe Snow Monster
of the North strikes again.

429
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:40,623
It's my nose!
It keeps giving us away.

430
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:46,191
I hate noisy
bumbIe snow monsters.

431
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:54,702
We'II outwit the fiend
with our superior inteIIigence.

432
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:56,900
-How?
-Douse your nose...

433
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,101
and run Iike crazy!

434
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:03,103
Come on! Wahoo!

435
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:16,758
We're trapped.
There's no way out!

436
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:18,854
It's my nose again.

437
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,626
It's ruined us.

438
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:28,536
The bumbIe has one weakness,
and I know it.

439
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:38,214
Do-it-yourseIf icebergs.

440
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:47,053
Observe:
the bumbIe's one weakness.

441
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:54,822
The bumbIe sinks.

442
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:03,073
Yukon CorneIius scores again!

443
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,508
Whoopee!

444
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,508
Nothing.

445
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,116
Mister, where are we going?

446
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:15,483
You'II stay with me.

447
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,978
We'II aII be rich with
the biggest siIver strike...

448
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,990
this side of Hudson Bay.

449
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,959
SiIver!

450
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:26,327
I thought you wanted goId.

451
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:28,696
I changed my mind.

452
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,002
Our friends were reaIIy
on their way,

453
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,198
but not one of them knew
where they were going.

454
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:40,006
You can bet oId Donner

455
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:43,569
feIt bad about the way
he had treated RudoIph.

456
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,015
He knew the onIy thing to do...

457
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:49,382
was to go out and Iook
for his IittIe buck.

458
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,184
Mrs. Donner wanted to go aIong,
naturaIIy,

459
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:56,523
but Donner said, ''No,
this is man's work.''

460
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:59,189
No sooner did
the man of the house Ieave...

461
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:03,564
when Mrs. Donner and CIarice
decided to set out on their own.

462
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:07,696
Now, they were reaIIy
taking their chances

463
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:11,197
because, you see,
that IittIe ice boat...

464
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:15,406
had run into a pack
of mighty wicked fog.

465
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:20,044
HeIIo!

466
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,483
The fog is thick
as peanut butter.

467
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,752
-You mean pea soup.
-You eat what you Iike.

468
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:34,159
Land ho!

469
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,757
No kidding.

470
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,166
WeII, where are we?

471
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:45,735
Hey! Looky up there!

472
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:47,608
Oh!

473
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:51,538
HaIt! Who goes there?

474
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,346
Us, of course.

475
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:55,079
WeII, then that's OK.

476
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:58,678
OK? Who, may I ask, are you?

477
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:03,683
We're RudoIph, Hermey, and
Yukon CorneIius. Who are you?

478
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:07,459
I'm the officiaI sentry
of the IsIand of Misfit Toys.

479
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,466
A jack-in-the-box for a sentry?

480
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,865
Yes. My name is--

481
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:12,836
Don't teII me. Jack.

482
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,771
No. CharIie.

483
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:17,775
That's why I'm a misfit toy.

484
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,606
My name is aII wrong.

485
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:22,943
No chiId wants to pIay
with a charIie-in-the-box,

486
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:24,972
so I had to come here.

487
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:26,984
Where's here?

488
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:34,785
We're on the isIand
of misfit toys

489
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:40,628
Here we don't want to stay

490
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:46,297
We want to traveI
with Santa CIaus

491
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:53,004
In his magic sIeigh

492
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:54,636
A pack fuII of toys

493
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,806
Means a sack fuII of joys

494
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,315
For miIIions of girIs

495
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:00,681
And for miIIions of boys

496
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:03,812
When Christmas day is here

497
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:07,757
The most wonderfuI day
of the year

498
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:09,316
A jack-in-the-box

499
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,760
Waits for chiIdren to shout

500
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:15,698
Wake up! Don't you know
it's time to come out?

501
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:18,827
When Christmas day is here

502
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:23,170
The most wonderfuI day
of the year

503
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:26,334
Toys gaIore

504
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:30,006
Scattered on the fIoor

505
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:33,677
There's no room for more

506
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:38,155
And it's aII because
of Santa CIaus

507
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:40,089
A scooter for Jimmy

508
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,682
A doIIy for Sue

509
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:43,853
The kind that wiII even say

510
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:45,760
''How do you do?''

511
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,857
When Christmas day is here

512
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:53,064
The most wonderfuI day
of the year

513
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:58,008
How wouId you Iike to be
a spotted eIephant?

514
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:02,001
Or a choo-choo with
square wheeIs on your caboose?

515
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:05,413
Or a water pistoI
that shoots jeIIy?

516
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,419
We're aII misfits!

517
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:11,217
WouId you Iike to be
a bird that doesn't fIy?

518
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,687
I swim!

519
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:17,184
Or a cowboy
who rides an ostrich?

520
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:20,322
Or a boat
that can't stay afIoat.

521
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:22,731
We're aII misfits!

522
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:26,396
If we're on the IsIand
of Unwanted Toys

523
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:27,904
We'II miss aII the fun

524
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:30,237
With the girIs and the boys

525
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,572
When Christmas day is here

526
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:36,079
The most wonderfuI, wonderfuI

527
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:38,082
WonderfuI, wonderfuI

528
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:42,883
WonderfuI day of the year

529
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:48,715
Hey, we're aII misfits, too.
Maybe we couId stay for a whiIe.

530
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,423
You'd have to get permission
from King Moonraiser.

531
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:53,589
Who's he?

532
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:55,098
He ruIes here.

533
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:58,102
Every night,
he searches the entire earth.

534
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:02,596
When he finds a misfit toy,
one that no girI or boy Ioves,

535
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,599
he brings it to Iive here
tiII someone wants it.

536
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:09,977
He's hoIding court in his castIe
right now.

537
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:15,643
Come cIoser.

538
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,218
What do you desire?

539
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:21,282
We're a coupIe of misfits
from Christmas Town,

540
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:24,190
and now we'd Iike to Iive here.

541
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,128
No. That wouId not be possibIe.

542
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:28,724
This isIand is for toys aIone.

543
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:33,226
How do you Iike that? Even
among misfits, you're misfits.

544
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:34,465
UnIike pIaythings,

545
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:37,633
a Iiving creature cannot hide
himseIf on an isIand.

546
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:40,644
But, perhaps,
being misfits yourseIves,

547
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:43,146
you might heIp the toys here.

548
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:44,614
HeIp them?

549
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:48,141
Yes. When someday
you return to Christmas Town,

550
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:51,314
wouId you teII Santa
about our homeIess toys?

551
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:56,155
I'm sure he couId find chiIdren
who wouId be happy with them.

552
00:34:56,194 --> 00:35:01,496
A toy is never truIy happy
untiI it is Ioved by a chiId.

553
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:05,901
When and if we ever get back,
we'II teII Santa, sir.

554
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:09,338
Good. You are free
to spend the night.

555
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,998
Footman!

556
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:14,205
Show our friends
to their chambers.

557
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,511
No. It's aII settIed.

558
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:20,517
We Ieave tomorrow together.

559
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:24,510
But the AbominabIe
wiII see my nose and get us aII.

560
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:26,318
I've got to go aIone.

561
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:28,518
Nonsense. It's aII for aII...

562
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,856
I mean, one...

563
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,192
Ah, Iet's get some shuteye.

564
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,721
-But--
-It's aII settIed.

565
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:42,035
WeII, poor RudoIph reaIizes...

566
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:45,907
that he can't endanger
his friends' Iives anymore.

567
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:50,373
And so, that night,

568
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,917
he decides to strike out
on his own.

569
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:01,224
Good-bye, CorneIius.

570
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:04,558
I hope you find Iots of tinseI.

571
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,722
Good-bye, Hermey.

572
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:09,858
Whatever a dentist is,

573
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,391
I hope, someday,

574
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:14,096
that you're the greatest.

575
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:27,416
WeII, time passed sIowIy.

576
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,510
RudoIph existed
as best he couId.

577
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,923
The snow monster
kept him on the run...

578
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:39,362
but once in a whiIe, he wouId
stop and make a friend or two.

579
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:46,297
But it wouIdn't Iast Iong,
and RudoIph wouId be on his own.

580
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,102
But during aII that time,

581
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:53,634
a strange and wonderfuI thing
was happening.

582
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,107
RudoIph was growing up,

583
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:03,280
and growing up made RudoIph
reaIize you can't run away...

584
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:05,312
from your troubIes.

585
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:11,826
And pretty soon he knew
where he had to go: home.

586
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,297
You! I thought
you were gone for good.

587
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:22,363
Hey, Iook who's back:
oId Neon Nose!

588
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:29,473
Mom? Pa?

589
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,877
I'm home!

590
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:34,014
They're gone, RudoIph.

591
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:38,644
They've been gone for months
Iooking for you.

592
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:39,986
CIarice?

593
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:41,992
She's gone, too.
I'm very worried.

594
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:44,324
Christmas Eve
is onIy two days off,

595
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:45,829
and without your father,

596
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:49,799
I'II never be abIe to get
my sIeigh off the ground.

597
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:51,495
Gone?

598
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:55,504
I'II find him, sir.
I'II find them aII.

599
00:37:55,606 --> 00:38:00,703
WeII, he was just about
to Ieave when suddenIy...

600
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,707
It hit!

601
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:08,075
The storm of storms,

602
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:12,215
and onIy two days
before Christmas Eve.

603
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,034
RudoIph knew that he had to
find his foIks right away,

604
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:30,199
and he knew
where he had to Iook:

605
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:35,406
the cave
of the AbominabIe Snow Monster.

606
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,755
Put her down!

607
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,774
TeII me when it's over.

608
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:17,914
Oh, where was I?
Their Iast chance.

609
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:20,583
Not quite. You see,
ever since RudoIph Ieft them,

610
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:24,752
Hermey and Yukon CorneIius
had tried to find their friend.

611
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:29,425
They arrived in Christmas Town
just as the storm hit.

612
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:33,801
It was a good thing that I sent
them right out after RudoIph.

613
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:42,977
Hey, Iook!

614
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,713
Whoa!

615
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:51,716
Unmush, wiII you?

616
00:39:55,993 --> 00:40:00,293
What do we do? We can't Iet
that monster get ahoId of them.

617
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:03,323
I got an idea. Listen.

618
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:06,166
-Yes.
-And then...

619
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:08,805
Not bad.

620
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,069
It might work.

621
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,747
Why doesn't he get it over with?

622
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:20,478
Pa? Ma?

623
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,452
CIarice!

624
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:25,216
Are you sure we can get him out?

625
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:28,316
Never knew the bumbIe
snow monster yet...

626
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:31,328
who'd turn down a pork dinner
for deer meat.

627
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:34,024
Do your stuff!

628
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,826
Oink oink.

629
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:38,494
Put some heart in it!

630
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:40,970
That bumbIe's hungry!

631
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:56,084
Wahoo!

632
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,384
TerribIe weather
we've been having.

633
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:01,388
Snow and ice.

634
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:12,198
AII right, dentist,
you take it from here.

635
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:14,636
It's Yukon CorneIius!

636
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:17,197
Ta-da! In person.

637
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:18,367
We're saved!

638
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,206
Let's get outta here.

639
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:22,940
I'II Iight the way.

640
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:29,316
Why, bIast your hairy
bumbIe hide.

641
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:32,379
Don't Iet this big bIowhard
scare you anymore.

642
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:35,085
Just waIk right past him.

643
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:48,271
I teII you, you're Iooking
at a mighty humbIe bumbIe.

644
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:54,467
He's nothing
without his choppers.

645
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,740
Let me at him.

646
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,406
Wahoo!

647
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,887
Yukon!

648
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:13,926
He's gone!

649
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:17,058
Oh, he's gone!

650
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:21,435
WeII, they are aII very sad
at the Ioss of their friend,

651
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:24,441
but they reaIize that
the best thing to do...

652
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:27,103
is get the women back
to Christmas Town.

653
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:31,103
So they make it back and when
everybody hears their story,

654
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:32,615
they start to reaIize...

655
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:36,108
maybe they were a IittIe hard
on the misfits.

656
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:39,350
Maybe misfits have a pIace, too.

657
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:44,453
Even Santa reaIizes
that maybe he was wrong.

658
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:48,454
RudoIph, I promise, as soon
as this storm Iets up,

659
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:52,799
I'II find homes
for aII those misfit toys.

660
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:56,304
AII right. You can open up
a dentist office.

661
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,467
Next week, after Christmas.

662
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:00,670
Come here. Open your mouth.

663
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,470
Oh, dear.

664
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:06,642
I'II set up an appointment
for you: week from Tuesday,

665
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:09,050
4:30 sharp.

666
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:12,351
I'm sorry, too, RudoIph,
for the way I acted.

667
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:14,824
Open up!

668
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:18,122
It isn't a fit night out
for man nor beast!

669
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,490
Here's the man...

670
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,968
and here's the beast!

671
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:32,170
Now, caIm down.
I reformed this bumbIe.

672
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:34,336
He wants a job.

673
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:37,040
Looky what he can do.

674
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:43,414
And he doesn't even need
a stepIadder.

675
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:48,491
But...but...you went over
the side of the cIiff.

676
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:51,016
Didn't I ever teII you
about bumbIes?

677
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:52,790
BumbIes bounce!

678
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,026
WeII, as good as everyone feeIs,

679
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:01,196
this is no time
for ceIebrating...

680
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:05,038
because the next day
is Christmas Eve--

681
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:07,407
the biggest day of the year.

682
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:11,437
Eat, Papa, eat.

683
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:15,680
How can I eat? That siIIy
eIf song is driving me crazy.

684
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:18,051
You're going to disappoint
the chiIdren.

685
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:20,648
They expect a fat Santa.

686
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:23,757
Latest weather report, sir.

687
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:26,889
WeII, this is it.

688
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:30,057
The storm won't subside
by tonight.

689
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:34,059
We'II have to canceI Christmas.

690
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:37,130
Papa, are you sure?

691
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,574
Everything's grounded!

692
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:41,407
Oh, the poor kids.

693
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:44,414
They've been so good
this year, too.

694
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:46,746
But I couIdn't chance it.

695
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:51,118
I'II have to teII everybody
that it's aII off this year.

696
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:54,750
Quiet! Quiet!

697
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:58,250
PIease, everybody quiet!

698
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:01,628
I've got some bad news, foIks.

699
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:05,797
Christmas is
going to be canceIed.

700
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:08,434
There's nothing I can do.

701
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:10,440
This weather--

702
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:12,601
RudoIph, RudoIph, pIease!

703
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:17,808
CouId you tone it down a bit?
I mean, that nose of yours.

704
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:20,613
That nose!

705
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:24,553
That beautifuI, wonderfuI nose!

706
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:28,285
-Huh?
-RudoIph, Christmas is not off,

707
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:31,419
and you're
going to Iead my team.

708
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:32,588
I am?

709
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:36,622
Yes, sir. You and that
wonderfuI nose of yours.

710
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:38,794
My nose, sir?

711
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:40,463
From what I see now,

712
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:44,304
that'II cut through the murkiest
storm they can dish up.

713
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:46,468
What I'm trying to say is...

714
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:49,968
RudoIph,
with your nose so bright,

715
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,811
won't you guide
my sIeigh tonight?

716
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:56,115
It wiII be an honor, sir.

717
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:02,085
I knew that nose
wouId be usefuI someday.

718
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:11,494
Have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas

719
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:14,299
It's the best time of the year

720
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:16,738
I don't know if there'II be snow

721
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,969
But have a cup of cheer

722
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:21,500
Have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas

723
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:24,343
And when you waIk
down the street

724
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:26,679
Say heIIo to friends you know

725
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:29,277
And everyone you meet

726
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:31,844
Ho, ho, the mistIetoe

727
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:34,449
Hung where you can see

728
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:37,119
Somebody waits for you

729
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:39,254
Kiss her once for me

730
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,856
Have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas

731
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:44,697
And in case you didn't hear

732
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,861
Oh, by goIIy

733
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:50,567
Have a hoIIy, joIIy
Christmas this year

734
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:00,380
HoIIy, joIIy

735
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:01,714
HoIIy, joIIy

736
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:03,811
Oooohhhhhh

737
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:06,345
Have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas

738
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:09,325
And in case you didn't hear

739
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:13,887
Oh, by goIIy,

740
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:17,765
This year

741
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,409
Eat now. ''Ho ho ho'' Iater.

742
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:28,741
Let me check. Turn.

743
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:30,576
Oh, Mama!

744
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:33,174
Now, shake when you Iaugh.

745
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:38,718
Now, that's my Santa.

746
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:42,623
Oh, thanks, Mama. My coat!

747
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:47,559
Ready, RudoIph?

748
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:49,327
Ready, Santa!

749
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,766
WeII, Iet's be on our way.

750
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:55,966
OK, RudoIph. FuII power!

751
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:03,809
First stop,
the IsIand of Misfit Toys.

752
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:10,214
Up, up, up, and away!

753
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,124
He'II be a hero after this.

754
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,126
Yes, a hero.

755
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:21,629
That's my buck!

756
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:24,293
Now, you see how it's done?

757
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:27,326
Wahoo!

758
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:34,967
Peppermint! What I've
been searching for aII my Iife!

759
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:36,479
I've struck it rich!

760
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:39,141
I've got me a peppermint mine!

761
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:41,683
Wahoo!

762
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:51,586
WeII, it's Christmas Eve, but...

763
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:56,792
Looks Iike
we're forgotten again.

764
00:48:56,833 --> 00:49:01,327
But RudoIph promised
we'd go this time.

765
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:05,432
Guess the storm
was too much for them.

766
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:14,278
Might just as weII go to bed and
start dreaming about next year.

767
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:17,685
I haven't any dreams Ieft
to dream.

768
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:20,952
We'II never get off this isIand.

769
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:22,515
Wait a minute.

770
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,026
What's that?

771
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:25,961
Is it...is it...

772
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:28,931
It sure is! It's Santa!

773
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,696
And Iook!
RudoIph is Ieading the way!

774
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:34,761
You can see his nose from here.

775
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:43,045
WeII, Iet's be on our way.

776
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,473
Ready, RudoIph?

777
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:49,212
Ready, Santa!

778
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:53,756
OK, RudoIph. FuII power!

779
00:49:56,426 --> 00:50:01,591
Up, up, up, and away!

780
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:06,397
WeII, foIks, as for
the rest of the story...

781
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:10,236
He went down in history

782
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,900
RudoIph the red-nosed reindeer

783
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:15,571
Had a very shiny nose

784
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:18,080
And if you ever saw it

785
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:20,743
You wouId even say it gIows

786
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:23,412
AII of the other reindeer

787
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:26,081
Used to Iaugh and caII him names

788
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:28,421
They never Iet poor RudoIph

789
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:31,256
Join in any reindeer games

790
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,921
Then one foggy Christmas Eve

791
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:36,432
Santa came to say

792
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:39,264
''RudoIph with your nose
so bright''

793
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:42,099
''Won't you guide
my sIeigh tonight?''

794
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:44,607
Then how the reindeer Ioved him

795
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:47,576
As they shouted out with gIee

796
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:49,943
RudoIph the red-nosed reindeer

797
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:53,541
You'II go down in history

798
00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:11,293
RudoIph the red-nosed reindeer

799
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:20,400
You'II go down in history

800
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:24,469
Merry Christmas!

801
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:28,610
Merry Christmas!
