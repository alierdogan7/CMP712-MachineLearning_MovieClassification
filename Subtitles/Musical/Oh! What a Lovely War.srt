1
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,019
I say,
the Archduke's got his wife with him.

2
00:04:49,144 --> 00:04:51,386
I thought they usually kept her
out of sight.

3
00:04:51,522 --> 00:04:54,060
Today is their 14th wedding anniversary.

4
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:56,480
I see.
So that's why she's been allowed out.

5
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,733
It's a pity he married beneath him.

6
00:04:59,238 --> 00:05:01,029
What on earth will they do with her

7
00:05:01,156 --> 00:05:03,730
when he inerits the Austrian empire?

8
00:05:03,951 --> 00:05:06,193
Perhaps by that time, madame,

9
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:10,034
Austria will no longer have an empire.

10
00:05:10,165 --> 00:05:12,123
My dear Monsieur Poincaré.

11
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:14,576
Don't tell me you've got
some delicious piece of gossip.

12
00:05:14,712 --> 00:05:15,992
You must understand, my dear,

13
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,463
that France doesn't approve of Austria
at the moment.

14
00:05:19,592 --> 00:05:21,880
- Oh?
- Against Austria, nothing.

15
00:05:22,886 --> 00:05:25,128
But their foreign minister...

16
00:05:25,556 --> 00:05:28,889
Count Berchtold?
Why, he's absolutely charming.

17
00:05:29,018 --> 00:05:31,591
He wishes to make a war against Serbia,

18
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:34,267
so he crawls to the Kaiser for aid.

19
00:05:34,607 --> 00:05:37,180
I don't think there'll be any war.

20
00:05:37,735 --> 00:05:39,644
There speaks the true diplomat.

21
00:05:39,778 --> 00:05:43,397
And if there is, there's certainly no need
for us to get involved.

22
00:05:43,532 --> 00:05:46,866
Yes. Well, I mean,
you know, who cares?

23
00:05:47,369 --> 00:05:49,362
Serbia's such a little country anyway,
you know.

24
00:05:49,496 --> 00:05:51,776
And I mean, they're always
up to something, aren't they?

25
00:05:51,777 --> 00:05:53,741
Serbia is little, madame,

26
00:05:54,126 --> 00:05:55,834
but it will not be a little war.

27
00:05:55,961 --> 00:05:59,247
Well, that's up to you
and the Russians, isn't it?

28
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,376
As you wish.
Please excuse me, madame.

29
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,839
Enchantée.

30
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,381
Sir Edward.

31
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,933
- My dear Edward.
- Poldy.

32
00:06:14,772 --> 00:06:16,266
Your Majesty, you know

33
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:18,355
the British Secretary
of State for Foreign Affairs,

34
00:06:18,484 --> 00:06:19,812
Sir Edward Grey.

35
00:06:20,402 --> 00:06:24,234
Count Helmuth von Moltke,
Chief of the German General Staff.

36
00:06:24,573 --> 00:06:27,111
Still expanding your army and navy?

37
00:06:27,952 --> 00:06:29,825
We like to keep busy.

38
00:06:39,505 --> 00:06:41,544
Yes, we're off to sign the...

39
00:06:41,674 --> 00:06:43,962
He's forced me to mobilise...

40
00:06:49,014 --> 00:06:51,588
I see the French President
is hobnobbing with the Czar again.

41
00:06:51,725 --> 00:06:54,560
I really think they mean
to fight with us over Serbia.

42
00:06:54,687 --> 00:06:56,347
Quite ridiculous.

43
00:06:57,231 --> 00:07:00,018
Couldrt you persuade your king
to have a talk to the Czar?

44
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,265
After all, they're cousins.

45
00:07:01,402 --> 00:07:04,521
Why not ask the Kaiser?
He's a cousin of Nicholas, too.

46
00:07:04,905 --> 00:07:08,239
Well, I hope the French haven't
encouraged you to do anything foolish.

47
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:10,573
Germany is with us.
It could be embarrassing.

48
00:07:10,703 --> 00:07:13,739
- Because our royal family is German?
- Precisely.

49
00:07:13,872 --> 00:07:17,953
I think they may be relied on
to play their part.

50
00:07:18,085 --> 00:07:19,912
Excellent. Excellent.

51
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:24,423
After all,
the last thing any of us want is a war.

52
00:07:26,468 --> 00:07:27,548
War?

53
00:07:28,012 --> 00:07:30,135
War is unthinkable!

54
00:07:30,264 --> 00:07:31,758
It is out of the question!

55
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:34,464
It would upset the balance of power.

56
00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:38,885
We Germans are an industrious
and moral people.

57
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:42,724
We have earned the right to have
our say in the world's affairs.

58
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,311
The Republic of France
is the seat of reason,

59
00:07:46,905 --> 00:07:49,906
the centre of world civilisation
and culture!

60
00:07:50,034 --> 00:07:53,118
Now, look here. The British Empire
is the most magnificent example...

61
00:07:53,245 --> 00:07:54,574
Gentlemen!

62
00:07:55,914 --> 00:07:57,243
Gentlemen.

63
00:07:58,042 --> 00:08:00,580
Ready for the shot, if you please!

64
00:08:26,362 --> 00:08:28,401
Would the Italian and Turkish gentlemen

65
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,856
move in a little closer, please?

66
00:08:57,893 --> 00:09:01,096
Right. Nice smile for everybody!

67
00:09:08,195 --> 00:09:10,069
Austrian Archduke assassinated.

68
00:09:10,197 --> 00:09:12,522
Austrian Archduke assassinated!

69
00:09:12,658 --> 00:09:14,983
Austrian Archduke assassinated!

70
00:09:15,661 --> 00:09:18,946
Hey, wait for me!
I want to see the Emperor, too!

71
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,993
Count Berchtold? Count Berchtold!

72
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:26,415
Wait for me! Count Berchtold!

73
00:09:44,565 --> 00:09:48,016
Have you signed the declaration of war,
Your Majesty?

74
00:09:48,777 --> 00:09:53,238
Have you signed the declaration of war,
Your Majesty?

75
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:06,158
I have this report from the Commander
of the Fourth Army Corps.

76
00:10:06,295 --> 00:10:08,169
"Serbian troops have fired on our positions

77
00:10:08,297 --> 00:10:09,921
"from steamers on the Danube.

78
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:12,207
"Our troops, in order to defend themselves,

79
00:10:12,343 --> 00:10:15,047
"were forced to return the enemy fire.

80
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:18,675
"A considerable skirmish developed."

81
00:10:23,437 --> 00:10:25,560
"Assassination, terrorism...

82
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,521
"Failure to accede
to our legitimate demands,"

83
00:10:30,653 --> 00:10:32,479
et cetera, et cetera.

84
00:10:32,738 --> 00:10:35,822
"Austria now at war with Serbia."

85
00:10:37,785 --> 00:10:41,569
The more so since Serbian provocateurs

86
00:10:41,705 --> 00:10:45,833
are already attacking
Austrian troop positions.

87
00:10:48,962 --> 00:10:52,545
Hostilities have already begun.

88
00:11:53,235 --> 00:11:56,271
But that wasrt true.
The Serbians haven't attacked anyone.

89
00:11:56,405 --> 00:11:57,899
Of course not.

90
00:11:58,073 --> 00:12:01,857
And as the information about the
Serbian attack has not been confirmed,

91
00:12:01,994 --> 00:12:05,742
I have taken it upon myself
to erase all reference to the incident

92
00:12:06,081 --> 00:12:08,288
from the declaration of war.

93
00:12:19,887 --> 00:12:21,429
Your Majesties,

94
00:12:22,514 --> 00:12:24,970
Your Excellencies, my lords,

95
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,263
gentlemen.

96
00:12:26,477 --> 00:12:27,888
Ready when you are.

97
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,804
Take your places, please,
for the ever-popular war game.

98
00:12:32,983 --> 00:12:36,103
Complete with songs, battles
and a few jokes.

99
00:12:43,744 --> 00:12:46,911
The whole of Europe will explode
at any moment.

100
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:50,790
Can Germany do nothing to stop
the Austrians?

101
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,537
Apparently not.

102
00:12:53,045 --> 00:12:56,165
We are the only country
prepared to help the Serbs.

103
00:12:56,298 --> 00:12:58,967
If Russia mobilises, so will Germany.

104
00:12:59,843 --> 00:13:02,679
France is bound by treaty to aid Russia.

105
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,100
Britain must make her position clear.

106
00:13:07,017 --> 00:13:09,060
I think we should all stay calm.

107
00:13:09,061 --> 00:13:10,341
I think we should all stay calm.

108
00:13:10,342 --> 00:13:13,437
The world will be engulfed
in the most terrible of wars,

109
00:13:13,732 --> 00:13:16,982
the ultimate aim of which
is the ruin of Germany.

110
00:13:17,403 --> 00:13:19,526
England, France and Russia

111
00:13:19,947 --> 00:13:22,652
are conspiring together to destroy us.

112
00:13:23,117 --> 00:13:24,575
Your Majesty,

113
00:13:25,703 --> 00:13:28,538
we know for a fact that
you are mobilising the Russian army.

114
00:13:28,664 --> 00:13:30,870
Upon my word of honour, you are wrong.

115
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,250
I do not doubt it,
but we have irrefutable proof.

116
00:13:34,503 --> 00:13:37,504
- You want my word of honour in writing?
- No.

117
00:13:38,257 --> 00:13:39,371
Thank you.

118
00:13:39,508 --> 00:13:41,068
In that case, I can only repeat to you,

119
00:13:41,176 --> 00:13:45,126
at this hour not one man,
not one horse has been called up.

120
00:13:48,642 --> 00:13:52,225
I must congratulate you
on persuading Italy to join us.

121
00:13:53,272 --> 00:13:56,438
Our allies are dropping away from us
like rotten apples,

122
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:58,144
even before the war has started.

123
00:13:58,277 --> 00:14:02,275
General mobilisation is ordered
by the St Petersburg Council of War.

124
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:06,190
France has mobilised, too,
Your Imperial Majesty.

125
00:14:06,327 --> 00:14:08,948
The encirclement of Germany
is an accomplished fact.

126
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:11,451
We have run our heads into a noose.

127
00:14:11,582 --> 00:14:12,827
England?

128
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,369
She has not yet made up her mind.

129
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:16,411
- Abandon the plan.
- It is too late.

130
00:14:16,545 --> 00:14:19,001
The wheels are already in motion.

131
00:14:21,216 --> 00:14:23,589
Get in touch with my cousin, King George V.

132
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:26,175
Inform him my troops are being prevented,

133
00:14:26,305 --> 00:14:28,712
by telephone and telegram,
from passing through Belgium.

134
00:14:28,849 --> 00:14:31,340
They've gone into Luxembourg, sir.

135
00:14:32,436 --> 00:14:35,188
The lamps are going out all over Europe.

136
00:14:35,898 --> 00:14:39,101
We shall not see them lit again
in our lifetime.

137
00:14:39,234 --> 00:14:41,026
Notify Lieutenant Feldmann.

138
00:14:41,153 --> 00:14:43,644
He is to withdraw immediately
from Luxembourg.

139
00:14:43,781 --> 00:14:47,399
To retreat now would be disastrous.
We must go forward.

140
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:50,698
Very well.

141
00:14:52,998 --> 00:14:54,991
Advance into Luxembourg!

142
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:57,542
The sword is drawn!

143
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,457
I cannot sheath it again
without victory and honour!

144
00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:02,665
All of you shall and will see to it

145
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,050
that only in honour
is it returned to the scabbard.

146
00:15:06,178 --> 00:15:10,223
Let every man look into his own heart
and his own feelings

147
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:15,551
and construe for himself
the extent of his obligation for himself.

148
00:15:15,729 --> 00:15:16,808
Sir.

149
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:19,521
They've invaded Belgium.

150
00:15:22,027 --> 00:15:24,269
Now you'll have to go to war.

151
00:15:27,574 --> 00:15:29,033
You're wanted at headquarters, sir.

152
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,404
Your Majesty.

153
00:15:30,536 --> 00:15:33,074
General's brigade, march!

154
00:15:39,044 --> 00:15:42,579
We do not see any reason,
however distant, for a conflict.

155
00:15:42,715 --> 00:15:46,664
May I beg Your Excellency
to express to His Majesty

156
00:15:46,927 --> 00:15:51,969
my profound gratitude for all the
marks of friendship and consideration

157
00:15:52,308 --> 00:15:54,929
which I have received
in the last eight months.

158
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,931
And assure him of the profound respect

159
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,270
of His Majesty the King,

160
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:03,858
who regards His Majesty
with deep veneration

161
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:08,192
and expresses the hope
that the most regrettable state of war

162
00:16:08,324 --> 00:16:13,318
between Great Britain and the monarchy
may be of no long duration.

163
00:16:13,454 --> 00:16:15,245
I am extremely perturbed at the thought

164
00:16:15,372 --> 00:16:17,744
that we should find ourselves at conflict
with England

165
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:19,832
since the two countries
are so near to one another

166
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,792
politically and morally, with
traditional sympathies and interests.

167
00:16:23,922 --> 00:16:26,840
Allow me to share your hope
that the present,

168
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:30,550
most unfortunate state of war
will be of no long duration

169
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:33,965
and that normal relations
will shortly be resumed.

170
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,837
Mum, a band! A band!

171
00:17:18,686 --> 00:17:19,800
Come on! Come on!

172
00:17:19,937 --> 00:17:21,396
Come on! Come on!

173
00:17:22,356 --> 00:17:23,731
Coming.

174
00:17:25,484 --> 00:17:27,642
Grandpa, look! It's a band!

175
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,194
Mummy! Mummy! Mummy!

176
00:20:02,891 --> 00:20:05,050
By the centre, quick march!

177
00:20:05,185 --> 00:20:07,558
Ha'penny won'th of chips, please.

178
00:20:13,986 --> 00:20:18,031
Oh, I do like to live beside the seaside

179
00:20:18,157 --> 00:20:21,573
I do like to be beside the sea

180
00:20:23,954 --> 00:20:27,038
- Good morning, Sir Douglas.
- Good morning, Miss Bates.

181
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:32,495
Oh, I do like to see a lot of soldiers

182
00:20:33,047 --> 00:20:36,001
Oh, soldiers are what I like to see

183
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:38,632
And if they've got a sword and horse

184
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:40,421
Then I like them more, of course

185
00:20:40,554 --> 00:20:43,721
Because I just love the cavalry

186
00:20:44,516 --> 00:20:48,300
Oh, I do like to live beside the seaside

187
00:20:48,437 --> 00:20:52,020
I do like to be beside the sea

188
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:55,850
Oh I do like to stroll
along the prom prom prom

189
00:20:55,986 --> 00:20:59,818
Where the brass bands play
tiddley-om-pom-pom

190
00:21:01,742 --> 00:21:04,696
Right. Come along, then.
First man, please.

191
00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:09,531
Brownley, Cecil. One, please.

192
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,287
Thank you very much.

193
00:21:13,462 --> 00:21:16,249
- Lang, Mary.
- Thank you.

194
00:21:16,924 --> 00:21:18,466
Take her, love.

195
00:21:20,886 --> 00:21:22,926
Smith, Florence Victoria.

196
00:21:23,931 --> 00:21:25,805
Smith, Jack Henry.

197
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,110
Smith, Mary Emma. Thank you.

198
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:39,396
Smith, Harry Arnold.

199
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:51,329
Smith, Elizabeth May.

200
00:21:52,876 --> 00:21:55,165
Smith, George Patrick Michael.

201
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,123
Wilson, Rose.

202
00:21:59,967 --> 00:22:01,876
Smith, Frederick Percy.

203
00:22:02,011 --> 00:22:05,177
Smith, Dickie.
I beg your pardon, sir. Richard.

204
00:22:06,724 --> 00:22:10,673
Ex-Colour Sergeant Smith,
King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry.

205
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:14,554
- Splendid.
- One, please. Dalby, Gwen.

206
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,018
Thank you.

207
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:18,941
Smith, Bertram Biddle.

208
00:22:26,744 --> 00:22:27,989
Come on.

209
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,747
Come down off of there.

210
00:22:42,676 --> 00:22:44,918
- Jack, here.
- Hello.

211
00:22:45,137 --> 00:22:46,417
Come on.

212
00:22:56,607 --> 00:22:58,564
Don't be daft, we're on holiday.

213
00:23:04,156 --> 00:23:05,354
Harry.

214
00:23:24,093 --> 00:23:25,587
Hot potatoes!

215
00:23:26,136 --> 00:23:27,381
Hot potatoes!

216
00:23:27,513 --> 00:23:29,007
Here, Freddie.

217
00:23:31,016 --> 00:23:32,261
Potatoes!

218
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:33,758
George!

219
00:23:40,401 --> 00:23:41,480
No.

220
00:23:42,278 --> 00:23:43,522
George.

221
00:23:46,907 --> 00:23:48,781
Grandpa, look, there's a soldier.

222
00:23:52,496 --> 00:23:53,824
Mesdames et messieurs,

223
00:23:53,956 --> 00:23:56,873
presenting for your greatest entertainment,

224
00:23:57,084 --> 00:24:00,204
the most fantastic spectacle
of the world today,

225
00:24:00,337 --> 00:24:02,793
the armée française in all its glory!

226
00:24:02,923 --> 00:24:06,541
Its banners, its uniforms will pass now

227
00:24:06,677 --> 00:24:09,168
before your very eyes. Rideau!

228
00:24:15,561 --> 00:24:19,309
- Bonjour, soldier.
- Bonjour, mon colonel.

229
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,188
- It's a good day for the chase.
- We await your orders.

230
00:24:32,661 --> 00:24:37,240
A battle won is a battle in which
one will not confess oneself beaten.

231
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:27,797
A silly German sausage dreamt

232
00:25:27,925 --> 00:25:29,799
Napoleon he'd be

233
00:25:29,927 --> 00:25:31,966
Then he went and broke his promise

234
00:25:32,096 --> 00:25:34,088
It was made in Germany

235
00:25:34,431 --> 00:25:38,678
He shook hands with Britannia
and eternal peace he swore

236
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:42,934
Naughty boy, he talked of peace
while he prepared for war

237
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,770
His warships sailed upon the sea
they looked a pretty sight

238
00:25:47,903 --> 00:25:52,115
But when they heard the bulldog bark
they disappeared from sight

239
00:25:52,241 --> 00:25:56,950
The Kaiser said, 'Be careful
if by Jellicoe they're seen

240
00:25:57,704 --> 00:26:00,705
'Then every man-of-war I've got

241
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:03,205
'Will be a submarine'

242
00:26:12,303 --> 00:26:16,347
Belgium put the kibosh on the Kaiser

243
00:26:16,724 --> 00:26:19,641
Europe took the stick and made him sore

244
00:26:20,269 --> 00:26:22,261
On his throne it hurts to sit

245
00:26:22,396 --> 00:26:24,389
And when John Bull starts to hit

246
00:26:24,523 --> 00:26:28,022
He will never sit upon it anymore

247
00:26:39,204 --> 00:26:43,498
He'll have to go to school again
and learn his geography

248
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:47,909
He quite forgot Britannia
and the hands across the sea

249
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:52,543
Australia and Canada
the Russian and the Jap

250
00:26:53,135 --> 00:26:58,177
And England looked so small
he couldn't see her on the map

251
00:26:58,307 --> 00:27:02,601
For Belgium put the kibosh on the Kaiser

252
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:06,269
Europe took the stick and made him sore

253
00:27:06,523 --> 00:27:10,473
We shall shout with victory's joy
Hold your hand out, naughty boy

254
00:27:10,611 --> 00:27:14,443
You must never play at soldiers anymore

255
00:27:39,556 --> 00:27:42,972
He'll never sit upon it anymore

256
00:27:43,978 --> 00:27:47,512
Belgium put the kibosh on the Kaiser

257
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,775
Europe took a stick and made him sore

258
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,603
On his throne it hurts to sit

259
00:27:53,737 --> 00:27:55,529
And when John Bull starts to hit

260
00:27:55,656 --> 00:27:58,657
He will never sit upon it anymore

261
00:28:07,251 --> 00:28:09,540
On his throne it hurts to sit

262
00:28:11,088 --> 00:28:13,495
And when John Bull starts to hit

263
00:28:15,134 --> 00:28:16,925
He will never sit upon it

264
00:28:17,052 --> 00:28:18,712
He will never sit upon it

265
00:28:18,846 --> 00:28:21,171
He will never sit upon it...

266
00:28:37,656 --> 00:28:39,448
Paper! Paper!

267
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,242
Brussels falls!

268
00:28:41,535 --> 00:28:42,946
Brussels falls!

269
00:28:43,078 --> 00:28:45,118
- Paper! Paper!
- Here, boy!

270
00:28:46,206 --> 00:28:49,907
Paper! Read all about it! Brussels falls!

271
00:29:28,499 --> 00:29:30,990
'The battlefield is unbelievable.

272
00:29:31,961 --> 00:29:36,041
'Heaps of corpses lying everywhere,
rifles in hand.

273
00:29:37,007 --> 00:29:40,210
'Thousands of dead in row after row.

274
00:29:42,346 --> 00:29:45,679
'Night has fallen,
and the rain has started.

275
00:29:46,517 --> 00:29:49,055
'Shells are bursting and screaming.

276
00:29:50,145 --> 00:29:52,387
'Artillery fire is the worst.

277
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,729
'We are all utterly exhausted.

278
00:29:57,236 --> 00:30:00,521
'I lie at night
listening to the wounded groaning.

279
00:30:01,824 --> 00:30:04,196
'The cannonading goes on and on.

280
00:30:05,202 --> 00:30:08,618
'Whenever it stops,
we hear the wounded crying out

281
00:30:08,747 --> 00:30:10,539
'from all over the woods.

282
00:30:11,417 --> 00:30:14,121
'Two or three men go mad every night.

283
00:30:19,383 --> 00:30:20,628
'I feel a great pity

284
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:24,294
'for many of the civilian population
who have lost everything.

285
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:27,881
'But they hate us.
One of them fired at us.

286
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:30,722
'He was immediately taken out...

287
00:30:38,027 --> 00:30:39,818
'Taken out and shot.

288
00:30:40,612 --> 00:30:43,364
'Yesterday, we were ordered to attack
the enemy flank

289
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:45,033
'in a forest of beeches,

290
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:48,160
'but the enemy gunner saw us first
and opened fire.

291
00:30:49,788 --> 00:30:53,157
'The casualties on both sides
were truly terrible.'

292
00:30:55,628 --> 00:30:57,834
Are we downearted?

293
00:30:57,963 --> 00:30:59,042
No!

294
00:30:59,381 --> 00:31:02,999
So let your voices ring
and all together sing

295
00:31:03,135 --> 00:31:04,926
Are we downearted?

296
00:31:05,637 --> 00:31:06,669
No!

297
00:31:07,306 --> 00:31:09,713
Not while Britannia rules the waves

298
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,178
Not likely

299
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:14,928
While we have Jack upon the sea

300
00:31:15,064 --> 00:31:18,314
And Tommy on the land we needrt fret

301
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:22,060
It's a long, long way to Tipperary

302
00:31:22,196 --> 00:31:25,814
But we're not downearted yet

303
00:31:25,949 --> 00:31:28,357
Are we downearted?

304
00:31:28,494 --> 00:31:29,739
No!

305
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:33,535
So let your voices ring
and all together sing

306
00:31:33,666 --> 00:31:35,872
Are we downearted?

307
00:31:36,001 --> 00:31:37,199
No!

308
00:31:37,336 --> 00:31:39,874
Not while Britannia rules the waves

309
00:31:40,005 --> 00:31:41,203
Not likely

310
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,839
While we have Jack upon the sea

311
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:48,088
And Tommy on the land we needrt fret

312
00:31:48,222 --> 00:31:51,887
It's a long, long way to Tipperary

313
00:31:52,017 --> 00:31:55,018
But we're not downearted

314
00:31:55,562 --> 00:31:57,851
yet

315
00:32:21,296 --> 00:32:24,582
We watched you playing cricket
and every kind of game

316
00:32:24,717 --> 00:32:27,836
At football, golf and polo
you men have made your name

317
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:31,920
But now your country calls you
to play your part in war

318
00:32:32,057 --> 00:32:34,679
And no matter what befalls you

319
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:38,636
We shall love you all the more

320
00:32:39,148 --> 00:32:44,273
So come and join the forces
as your fathers did before

321
00:32:44,445 --> 00:32:48,229
Oh, we don't want to lose you

322
00:32:48,365 --> 00:32:51,983
But we think you ought to go

323
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:56,033
For your king and your country

324
00:32:56,165 --> 00:32:59,331
Both need you so

325
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,995
We shall want you and miss you

326
00:33:03,172 --> 00:33:06,505
But with all our might and main

327
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,169
We shall cheer you, thank you, kiss you

328
00:33:10,304 --> 00:33:13,673
When you come back again

329
00:33:29,698 --> 00:33:33,399
Oh, we don't want to lose you

330
00:33:33,535 --> 00:33:37,200
But we think you ought to go

331
00:33:37,331 --> 00:33:41,329
For your king and your country

332
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,295
Both need you so

333
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:48,414
We shall want you and miss you

334
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:52,251
But with all our might and main

335
00:33:52,388 --> 00:33:57,133
We shall cheer you, thank you, kiss you

336
00:33:57,267 --> 00:34:02,013
When you come back again

337
00:34:17,538 --> 00:34:20,076
The Army and the Navy need attention

338
00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:23,703
The outlook isn't healthy, you'll admit

339
00:34:24,461 --> 00:34:28,329
But I have a perfect dream
of a new recruiting scheme

340
00:34:28,465 --> 00:34:31,419
Which I think is absolutely it

341
00:34:32,678 --> 00:34:35,595
If only other girls would do as I do

342
00:34:35,848 --> 00:34:38,849
I believe that we could manage it alone

343
00:34:39,309 --> 00:34:42,014
For I turn all suitors from me

344
00:34:42,187 --> 00:34:44,310
But the sailor and the Tommy

345
00:34:44,648 --> 00:34:48,313
I've an army and a navy of my own

346
00:34:49,445 --> 00:34:53,110
On Sunday I walk out with a soldier

347
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,992
Monday I'm taken by a tar

348
00:34:56,911 --> 00:35:00,244
Tuesday I'm out with a baby Boy Scout

349
00:35:00,372 --> 00:35:03,409
On Wednesday a hussar

350
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:07,452
On Thursday I gang oot wi' a Scottie

351
00:35:07,588 --> 00:35:10,458
On Friday the Captain of the crew

352
00:35:11,049 --> 00:35:15,546
But on Saturday, I'm willing
if you'll only take the shilling

353
00:35:15,846 --> 00:35:18,764
To make a man of any one of you

354
00:35:31,987 --> 00:35:34,822
I teach the tenderfoot to face the powder

355
00:35:35,532 --> 00:35:38,284
That gives an added lustre to my skin

356
00:35:38,994 --> 00:35:43,206
And I show the raw recruit
how to give a chaste salute

357
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:46,825
So when I'm presenting arms he's falling in

358
00:35:47,878 --> 00:35:50,630
It makes you almost proud to be a woman

359
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:54,252
When you make a strapping soldier of a kid

360
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,085
And he says you put me through it

361
00:35:57,221 --> 00:36:01,468
And I didn't want to do it
but you went and made me love you

362
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,179
So I did

363
00:36:03,894 --> 00:36:07,228
On Sunday I walk out with a bosun

364
00:36:07,356 --> 00:36:09,894
On Monday a rifleman in green

365
00:36:10,693 --> 00:36:14,192
On Tuesday I choose a sub in the blues

366
00:36:14,321 --> 00:36:17,441
On Wednesday a marine

367
00:36:17,741 --> 00:36:21,193
On Thursday a terrier from Tooting

368
00:36:21,328 --> 00:36:24,495
On Friday a midshipman or two

369
00:36:24,707 --> 00:36:26,699
But on Saturday I'm willing

370
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:28,957
If you'll only take the shilling

371
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:31,755
To make a man of any one of you

372
00:36:34,842 --> 00:36:37,297
Come on, lads! We need a million!

373
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:38,756
A million!

374
00:36:39,513 --> 00:36:43,262
- Be a man! Enlist today!
- Enlist today!

375
00:36:43,851 --> 00:36:47,599
Have you a man digging your garden
when he should be digging trenches?

376
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,639
He should be digging trenches!

377
00:36:49,857 --> 00:36:53,190
Are there any able-bodied men
in the house?

378
00:36:53,694 --> 00:36:57,526
'Cause on Saturday I'm willing
if you'll only take the shilling

379
00:36:57,656 --> 00:37:00,028
To make a man of any one of you

380
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:09,952
Now, you heard what the lovely lady said!

381
00:37:10,085 --> 00:37:13,170
- We need a million of you!
- Able-bodied men.

382
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:15,788
Come along, my lucky lads!
Take the King's shilling.

383
00:37:15,924 --> 00:37:17,584
We'll make a man of you!

384
00:37:17,718 --> 00:37:21,418
- I'll turn you into a man.
- Give you the time of your life!

385
00:37:21,805 --> 00:37:24,379
I'll give you the time of your life.

386
00:37:24,641 --> 00:37:26,681
We'll give you the time of your life!

387
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:31,519
A kiss! A kiss from this lovely lady
for the first man to volunteer!

388
00:37:32,024 --> 00:37:35,108
You, sir! How about you, sir?

389
00:37:35,235 --> 00:37:37,905
That's right, sir! Why, step forward!

390
00:37:39,948 --> 00:37:43,649
Step forward now!
That's right, my lucky lad!

391
00:37:51,376 --> 00:37:52,787
Maudie!

392
00:37:53,796 --> 00:37:58,173
Come on, lads! You heard what I said!
We need a million of you!

393
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:17,319
Well done, my boy. Proud of you.

394
00:38:17,945 --> 00:38:19,569
Proud of you.

395
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:24,238
All right, dear. Lil!

396
00:38:25,911 --> 00:38:27,703
Hold on to him, love.

397
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:30,499
That's right, boys! Up you come!

398
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:34,037
Three more! Get on stage! Get up!

399
00:38:34,295 --> 00:38:35,575
You, sir!

400
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:37,954
Make your girlfriend proud of you.

401
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,498
Be a hero and step forward, sir.

402
00:38:41,635 --> 00:38:43,177
Thank you, sir.

403
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:46,056
One young lady still left unescorted.

404
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:51,970
You, sir! You may be fat and 40, sir,
but your country needs you.

405
00:38:52,354 --> 00:38:54,311
Come and join the army!

406
00:39:01,196 --> 00:39:04,696
'Cause on Saturday I'm willing
if you'll only take the shilling

407
00:39:04,825 --> 00:39:08,241
To make a man of any one of you

408
00:39:11,123 --> 00:39:15,037
To make a man of any one of you

409
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:25,385
What are you up to?

410
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,599
Get back into line,
you horrible little man, you.

411
00:39:33,103 --> 00:39:34,514
And all of you,

412
00:39:34,645 --> 00:39:36,805
from now on,
your bloody life won't be won'th living!

413
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,432
And you won't bloody die laughing, either!

414
00:39:39,902 --> 00:39:41,360
Now, then...

415
00:39:41,904 --> 00:39:43,102
Party,

416
00:39:43,489 --> 00:39:45,232
attention!

417
00:39:47,993 --> 00:39:49,701
Quite right, lad.

418
00:39:50,162 --> 00:39:54,491
We've just crossed the Belgian border.
We should be arriving in Mons

419
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:56,831
in about two hours' time.

420
00:39:59,505 --> 00:40:00,999
Now, see that?

421
00:40:01,715 --> 00:40:04,206
The commanders
of the British expeditionary force,

422
00:40:04,343 --> 00:40:07,961
Field Marshal Sir John French,
General Sir Henry Wilson.

423
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:11,176
Off to a big conference, more than likely.

424
00:40:16,689 --> 00:40:19,855
I must confess,
I'm not looking forward to this meeting.

425
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:22,351
What do you think the French will say, sir,

426
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:25,155
when they hear we only have four divisions

427
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,614
- instead of the six we promised?
- They can say what they like.

428
00:40:28,742 --> 00:40:29,821
Damn it all, Wilson,

429
00:40:29,869 --> 00:40:31,909
we're not under any obligation
to help the French.

430
00:40:32,037 --> 00:40:34,362
We've got our own war to fight.

431
00:40:35,082 --> 00:40:36,280
What?

432
00:40:36,959 --> 00:40:39,165
Yes, well, I've no doubt

433
00:40:39,294 --> 00:40:42,379
that they will appreciate
our point of view.

434
00:40:43,132 --> 00:40:44,709
One must always remember

435
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:48,258
the class of people
these French generals come from.

436
00:40:49,054 --> 00:40:51,510
They're mostly tradesmen, I believe.

437
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,843
I shart understand
a damn word they say anyway.

438
00:40:55,185 --> 00:40:57,759
In regard to our plan, sir,
I've actually worked out

439
00:40:57,896 --> 00:41:01,396
the number of gun carriages
we shall need for the first stage

440
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:03,565
and even the amount of forage
for the horses.

441
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:05,817
Would you care to see the figures?

442
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:09,737
Well, I thought, considering the terrain...

443
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:14,861
Yes, yes. We know all about your
bicycling trips through France, Wilson.

444
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,924
I realise it's a bit late, sir,

445
00:41:17,925 --> 00:41:20,325
but do you think
I should try to arrange for an interpreter

446
00:41:20,461 --> 00:41:22,453
to help us out at the conference?

447
00:41:22,588 --> 00:41:23,998
Don't be ridiculous, Wilson!

448
00:41:24,131 --> 00:41:26,587
The most vital consideration at the moment

449
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:29,386
is to maintain absolute secrecy.

450
00:41:54,328 --> 00:41:57,033
Well, I never seen one of them before.

451
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:03,001
I think I've won a prize.

452
00:42:03,128 --> 00:42:05,584
- So have I.
- You have, my lad.

453
00:42:06,632 --> 00:42:08,292
So have you all.

454
00:42:16,642 --> 00:42:19,263
Left turn! Quick march!

455
00:42:20,521 --> 00:42:22,809
Right then! Three shots for tuppence!

456
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:26,814
Come on, lad. How about you?

457
00:42:28,362 --> 00:42:31,067
That's right. And what about you, lad?

458
00:42:31,365 --> 00:42:34,282
Come on, step up.
Three shots for tuppence.

459
00:42:37,663 --> 00:42:41,708
- That's the ticket, Jack, lad.
- Right, don't fire the gun till I tell you.

460
00:42:43,752 --> 00:42:46,208
Get a good grip, firm and steady.

461
00:42:46,505 --> 00:42:49,257
The British riflemars the best
in the world.

462
00:42:50,217 --> 00:42:51,795
No, don't jerk.

463
00:42:52,344 --> 00:42:54,136
Squeeze the trigger.

464
00:42:54,763 --> 00:42:56,388
That's right.

465
00:42:56,807 --> 00:42:58,218
Steady now.

466
00:42:58,434 --> 00:43:00,640
- Don't blink, lad.
- Don't blink, lad.

467
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:03,938
- Left eye shut.
- Left eye shut.

468
00:43:04,064 --> 00:43:06,544
- Pick your targets carefully.
- Pick your targets carefully.

469
00:43:06,545 --> 00:43:08,523
Don't fire till you hear my command!

470
00:43:08,735 --> 00:43:12,021
Right, lads. Enemy in front, 400 yards.

471
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:15,574
Five rounds! Rapid fire!

472
00:43:22,082 --> 00:43:23,493
Cease fire!

473
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:27,038
Stand down.
Smith! Stand to until relieved.

474
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:28,451
Yes, sir.

475
00:43:34,261 --> 00:43:35,839
Listen to this.

476
00:43:35,971 --> 00:43:38,972
"In this new experience,
you may find temptation

477
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:42,267
"both in wine and women.
You must resist both.

478
00:43:42,436 --> 00:43:44,725
"Order to the troops. Signed, Kitchener,

479
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:47,061
"Secretary of bleeding State."

480
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:57,652
- Hot, isn't it, Sergeant?
- It'll be hotter still tomorrow, lad.

481
00:43:57,785 --> 00:43:59,745
They've pulled out
the Suffolks and the Warwicks

482
00:43:59,746 --> 00:44:01,370
and most of the rest of the corps.

483
00:44:01,497 --> 00:44:03,869
We'll make your mother proud of you yet.

484
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:06,451
What's happened to the French Army?

485
00:44:06,585 --> 00:44:08,625
The French Army's
nothing to do with us, laddie.

486
00:44:08,754 --> 00:44:10,154
We ain't asking any help from them,

487
00:44:10,155 --> 00:44:13,167
and they ain't getting any help from us,
even though they've asked.

488
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,376
So, we shall be here on our own then?

489
00:44:15,511 --> 00:44:18,512
Well, someone's got to look
after the shop, haven't they?

490
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:21,177
Here they come again! Fix bayonets!

491
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:25,894
Hold your fire, hold your fire. Wait for it.

492
00:44:26,272 --> 00:44:30,649
Pick your target at 300 yards!
Wagstaff, you horrible little wretch!

493
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:32,644
I'll tell you when!

494
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:42,615
I wish somebody would tell me
what's happening.

495
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:47,959
Send for the boys of the girls' brigade

496
00:44:48,836 --> 00:44:52,039
To set old England free

497
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:55,501
Send for me brother

498
00:44:55,801 --> 00:44:57,959
Me sister or me mother

499
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:02,219
But for God's sake, don't send me

500
00:45:02,975 --> 00:45:04,552
Enemy in front!

501
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:07,727
Five rounds, rapid fire!

502
00:45:12,735 --> 00:45:17,610
Wounded home from France!
First boys back from Mons!

503
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,447
Read all about it!

504
00:45:20,033 --> 00:45:21,113
Careful, now.

505
00:45:21,243 --> 00:45:22,986
Read all about it!

506
00:45:29,084 --> 00:45:31,124
Watch it, lads. Careful does it.

507
00:45:32,838 --> 00:45:34,249
Nurse!

508
00:45:42,556 --> 00:45:45,759
Come on, let's have you outside.
Outside!

509
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,770
- Look lively with that crutch, Spinks.
- It can't bring itself, can it?

510
00:45:51,899 --> 00:45:53,808
Come on! On your feet!

511
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:57,901
- No flags, then, Sarge?
- Very comical, Burgess.

512
00:45:58,572 --> 00:46:00,565
- Sergeant!
- Yes, lad?

513
00:46:01,283 --> 00:46:03,691
Oh, just smell that soot, boys.

514
00:46:04,036 --> 00:46:05,234
Lovely.

515
00:46:06,246 --> 00:46:09,331
Right now, smarten yourselves up!
Eyes front!

516
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,828
Attention!

517
00:46:13,295 --> 00:46:15,454
Thank you, Sergeant Dodds.
Stand the men at ease.

518
00:46:15,589 --> 00:46:17,795
Stand at ease! Carry on.

519
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:20,381
Ambulances are ready, Sarge.
Officers only.

520
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:21,673
What about the other ranks?

521
00:46:21,804 --> 00:46:23,804
No arrangements made for them
at the moment, sir.

522
00:46:23,806 --> 00:46:25,086
We'll be all right, sir.

523
00:46:25,224 --> 00:46:27,928
Transport's this way, sir,
if you care to follow me.

524
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:30,136
- Carry on, Sergeant.
- Sir.

525
00:46:31,605 --> 00:46:33,728
Nearly home, George.

526
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:52,077
Hello, Smith. Sorry about your leg.

527
00:46:52,584 --> 00:46:56,369
- Are you all right?
- It's better than being at Mons, eh, sir?

528
00:46:56,505 --> 00:46:59,839
- Yes. Good journey home?
- Yes, thank you, sir.

529
00:47:00,342 --> 00:47:02,133
Good. Chin up, then.

530
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:04,963
See you back at the front.

531
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:12,057
Now, gently. Gently. Stretcher down...

532
00:47:12,187 --> 00:47:14,227
You're wasting your time with him, darling.

533
00:47:14,356 --> 00:47:16,016
It's in splints.

534
00:47:16,734 --> 00:47:19,521
- That's enough of that.
- What about us, then, Sarge?

535
00:47:19,653 --> 00:47:21,860
I'm awaiting further orders.

536
00:47:22,948 --> 00:47:24,941
Will you sign this, please, Sergeant?

537
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:30,283
We're here because we're here because

538
00:47:30,456 --> 00:47:34,916
We're here because we're here

539
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:40,627
We're here because we're here because

540
00:47:41,175 --> 00:47:45,718
We're here because we're here

541
00:47:45,846 --> 00:47:47,886
All right, all right, all right.

542
00:47:48,015 --> 00:47:50,304
How about getting the train back,
then, Sarge?

543
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:52,643
You'll get back soon enough, lad.

544
00:47:52,644 --> 00:47:54,144
You'll get back soon enough, lad.

545
00:47:54,897 --> 00:47:58,645
- Hooray. Mafeking's been relieved.
- I'll have you, Burgess.

546
00:48:00,235 --> 00:48:02,221
- What is it, Corporal?
- It's all right, Sarge.

547
00:48:02,222 --> 00:48:04,302
Some lorry drivers have volunteered
to take the men

548
00:48:04,303 --> 00:48:05,983
to Millbank Hospital in their dinner hour.

549
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:08,356
Right, get them fell in.
I'll have a word with the RTO.

550
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:09,909
- Right you are, Sergeant.
- Right!

551
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:13,445
You heard what the Sergeant said.
Get yourselves fell in!

552
00:48:13,582 --> 00:48:15,539
Dontemann, Gray!

553
00:48:15,751 --> 00:48:17,578
Fall in as markers!

554
00:48:17,836 --> 00:48:19,331
The rest of you men,

555
00:48:19,505 --> 00:48:23,004
dress off from the left in two lines,
across the platform!

556
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:25,921
Come on, come on!
Double round the back there!

557
00:48:26,428 --> 00:48:28,753
I said dress off from the left!

558
00:48:28,973 --> 00:48:31,546
Some of you don't know
your left from your right!

559
00:48:31,683 --> 00:48:33,641
Carry him gently, boys.

560
00:48:34,353 --> 00:48:37,389
Don't worry.
We'll soon have you back at the front.

561
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:40,772
You're like a load of pregnant women!

562
00:48:40,901 --> 00:48:43,381
Blimey, if this is the way
you've been carrying on out there,

563
00:48:43,382 --> 00:48:45,022
we ain't got no chance!

564
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:47,646
Hey, you! Pay attention, will you?

565
00:48:48,075 --> 00:48:50,032
You're back in Blighty now!

566
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,485
And I want to see
you set some good examples!

567
00:48:52,621 --> 00:48:55,341
A couple of days with you lot,
we'll soon whip you into some shape.

568
00:48:55,342 --> 00:48:57,283
We want some spit and polish here.

569
00:48:57,417 --> 00:48:59,410
We're going out in a minute, marching off.

570
00:48:59,545 --> 00:49:01,745
We're going down the street,
you'd better look lively.

571
00:49:37,374 --> 00:49:40,209
Right. Get your stretcher party
moving, Corporal.

572
00:49:40,336 --> 00:49:41,960
Now, get a move on!

573
00:49:42,087 --> 00:49:44,958
- Stretcher party, ready.
- Right, now pull yourselves together.

574
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:48,127
Form up in two ranks on the left!
Come along!

575
00:49:49,178 --> 00:49:51,669
Party, attention!

576
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:55,430
Left turn!

577
00:49:56,435 --> 00:49:58,059
By the right!

578
00:49:58,187 --> 00:49:59,681
Quick march!

579
00:50:01,065 --> 00:50:02,773
Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag

580
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:05,272
Come on, now! Pick 'em up!

581
00:50:06,028 --> 00:50:07,308
Quit smiling!

582
00:50:07,446 --> 00:50:11,360
Smile, smile, smile

583
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:16,576
While you've a lucifer to light your fag

584
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:21,373
Smile, boys, that's the style

585
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:25,915
What's the use of worrying

586
00:50:26,048 --> 00:50:30,295
It never was won'thwhile

587
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:35,766
So pack up your troubles
in your old kit bag

588
00:50:35,891 --> 00:50:40,933
And smile, smile, smile

589
00:50:41,688 --> 00:50:43,811
Read all about it!

590
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:48,642
First wounded boys home from France!

591
00:50:49,571 --> 00:50:51,279
Read all about it!

592
00:51:11,844 --> 00:51:13,042
Thank you.

593
00:51:13,178 --> 00:51:15,420
I'm so glad it's real champagne.

594
00:51:15,597 --> 00:51:18,634
So many of even the best people
give one cider nowadays.

595
00:51:18,767 --> 00:51:21,685
I'm not using my German wine,
not while the war's on.

596
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:24,729
I think that's a splendid gesture, Stephen.

597
00:51:25,232 --> 00:51:27,272
I say, isn't that Olivia?

598
00:51:27,943 --> 00:51:30,019
Doesrt she look adorable?

599
00:51:30,696 --> 00:51:33,234
That black dress is stunning.

600
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:37,030
So many women
simply look depressing in mourning.

601
00:51:37,161 --> 00:51:39,830
Now, come along, Elenor.
Come along, come along.

602
00:51:39,955 --> 00:51:41,153
It is a bit rotten, you know,

603
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:43,662
all those chaps getting killed
and all that sort of thing.

604
00:51:43,792 --> 00:51:44,955
Not at all.

605
00:51:45,085 --> 00:51:47,374
The men at the front simply adore the war.

606
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:49,960
I had a letter from Julian the other day.

607
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:51,964
- Oh?
- Champagne, sir.

608
00:51:52,301 --> 00:51:54,792
He said it's like a great big picnic.

609
00:51:54,928 --> 00:51:57,799
Nobody grumbles at him for getting dirty.

610
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:00,725
Oh, dear.

611
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:02,891
Not a bit like Christmas, is it?

612
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,262
No. It's awfully dull.

613
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:09,144
Father's business has had
the most frightful knock.

614
00:52:09,276 --> 00:52:10,996
We'd all agreed that the French and Germans

615
00:52:11,028 --> 00:52:14,148
shouldn't touch
the iron ore works in Alsace-Lorraine,

616
00:52:14,281 --> 00:52:17,282
until some idiot French pilot
goes and drops a bomb.

617
00:52:17,409 --> 00:52:19,532
Oh, dear. That is too bad.

618
00:52:19,912 --> 00:52:21,240
What happened?

619
00:52:21,455 --> 00:52:23,282
He got court-martialled.

620
00:52:23,415 --> 00:52:24,696
- Splendid.
- Yeah.

621
00:52:25,334 --> 00:52:28,667
We're hoping to get
the contracts for tin hats.

622
00:52:29,088 --> 00:52:30,796
The whole army has to have them.

623
00:52:30,923 --> 00:52:32,417
How nice.

624
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,547
I thought of asking Nanny
to knit something,

625
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:40,633
- you know, mittens and things.
- That's a good idea.

626
00:52:41,058 --> 00:52:43,763
We sent a parcel to the chauffeur's son.

627
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:45,269
Some Benger's Food,

628
00:52:45,396 --> 00:52:47,435
a tinder box, compass

629
00:52:47,773 --> 00:52:48,936
and some nerve tonic.

630
00:52:49,066 --> 00:52:51,522
- How very nice.
- Yeah, I thought so.

631
00:52:51,985 --> 00:52:53,396
Do look.

632
00:53:06,959 --> 00:53:10,328
Bleeding Benger's Food
and nerve tonic again?

633
00:53:10,462 --> 00:53:13,000
Well, you shouldn't
have thanked him for the last lot.

634
00:53:13,131 --> 00:53:15,171
"In the actual battle zone,

635
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:18,337
"phosphorine gives
immediate relief and freedom

636
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:20,510
"from the severe exhaustion

637
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:22,513
"and steady loss of nerve force

638
00:53:22,641 --> 00:53:25,927
"which occurs
when under constant shellfire."

639
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:29,558
Hey, what's up with you?
Have you got company?

640
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:33,688
Yeah, you know last time I went down
to that delousing station,

641
00:53:34,236 --> 00:53:36,988
all they did was stick
a hot iron over my trousers.

642
00:53:37,114 --> 00:53:39,866
I came out with more than I went in with.

643
00:53:40,576 --> 00:53:42,200
You wrote another one, then?

644
00:53:42,327 --> 00:53:44,569
- Yeah.
- Well, give us a read of it.

645
00:53:48,208 --> 00:53:51,328
"If I should die, think only this of me

646
00:53:52,129 --> 00:53:54,418
"That there's some corner
of a foreign field

647
00:53:54,548 --> 00:53:57,834
"That is forever England There shall be

648
00:53:57,968 --> 00:54:00,922
"In that rich earth a richer dust concealed

"A dust whom England bore,

00:54:07,895 --> 00:54:09,603

"Washed by the rivers

00:54:17,529 --> 00:54:20,199
Hey, Mac. Will you listen to that?

655
00:54:21,533 --> 00:54:23,941
Yeah. They're copping it
down Railway Wood tonight.

656
00:54:24,078 --> 00:54:25,821
No. That's Hill 60.

657
00:54:26,163 --> 00:54:28,321
No, not that. Listen.

658
00:54:32,336 --> 00:54:33,616
What is it?

659
00:54:33,754 --> 00:54:34,999
Singing.

660
00:54:35,506 --> 00:54:37,346
It's those Welsh bastards
in the next trench.

661
00:54:37,382 --> 00:54:39,043
No. That's Jerry.

662
00:54:40,594 --> 00:54:41,839
That's an hymn.

663
00:54:41,971 --> 00:54:43,678
No, it's a carol.

664
00:54:44,139 --> 00:54:46,809
They sing well for a lot of bastards,
don't they?

665
00:54:46,934 --> 00:54:49,092
Sing up, Jerry. I cannae hear ye.

666
00:54:49,228 --> 00:54:51,220
Put a sock in it. Let's listen.

667
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:42,195
Nice, wasrt it?

668
00:55:43,782 --> 00:55:45,691
Very nice, matey!

669
00:55:48,704 --> 00:55:50,780
Hello, Tommy!

670
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:53,413
Hello, Tommy!

671
00:55:54,042 --> 00:55:55,501
He heard you.

672
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:01,047
Hello!

673
00:56:08,224 --> 00:56:09,255
Eh?

674
00:56:09,391 --> 00:56:10,720
How are you?

675
00:56:11,143 --> 00:56:13,136
I'm very well, thank you.

676
00:56:13,979 --> 00:56:15,260
Good night!

677
00:56:15,397 --> 00:56:17,105
Happy Christmas!

678
00:56:17,733 --> 00:56:19,690
Well, there's another day gone.

679
00:56:19,818 --> 00:56:21,941
- Hey, it's Christmas.
- Not today.

680
00:56:22,071 --> 00:56:23,399
Tomorrow, you great goonie.

681
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:25,155
I forgot it was Christmas.

682
00:56:25,282 --> 00:56:27,109
Tommy! Tommy!

683
00:56:27,242 --> 00:56:28,911
He doesn't give up, does he?

684
00:56:29,036 --> 00:56:30,447
What's the matter?

685
00:56:30,579 --> 00:56:32,157
It is for you now

686
00:56:32,289 --> 00:56:35,124
to sing us a good song for Christmas, ja?

687
00:56:35,542 --> 00:56:36,918
- Ja!
- Ja.

688
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,829
Who's going to sing, then?

689
00:56:39,964 --> 00:56:41,506
Give them up one of yours, Garbett.

690
00:56:41,632 --> 00:56:43,708
Aye, give them yours, Ben.

691
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:48,427
It was Christmas day in the cookhouse

692
00:56:48,555 --> 00:56:50,382
The happiest day of the year

693
00:56:50,516 --> 00:56:52,058
Mers hearts were full of gladness

694
00:56:52,184 --> 00:56:53,928
And their bellies full of beer

695
00:56:54,061 --> 00:56:55,685
When up spoke Private Shorthouse

696
00:56:55,813 --> 00:56:57,770
His face as bold as brass

697
00:56:57,898 --> 00:57:00,519
Saying, 'We don't want
your Christmas pudding

698
00:57:00,651 --> 00:57:02,608
'You can stick it up your... '

699
00:57:02,736 --> 00:57:07,066
Tidings of comfort and joy

700
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:08,658
Comfort and joy

701
00:57:08,784 --> 00:57:14,988
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy

702
00:57:15,374 --> 00:57:18,743
It was Christmas day in the harem

703
00:57:18,877 --> 00:57:20,787
The eunuchs were standing round

704
00:57:20,921 --> 00:57:22,878
And hundreds of beautiful women

705
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:24,999
Were stretched out on the ground

706
00:57:25,134 --> 00:57:27,340
When in came the bold, bad Sultan

707
00:57:27,469 --> 00:57:29,960
And gazed on his marble halls

708
00:57:30,097 --> 00:57:33,181
Saying, 'What do you want
for Christmas, boys? '

709
00:57:33,434 --> 00:57:35,473
And the eunuchs answered...

710
00:57:35,602 --> 00:57:39,896
Tidings of comfort and joy

711
00:57:40,024 --> 00:57:41,648
Comfort and joy

712
00:57:41,775 --> 00:57:48,822
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy

713
00:57:51,368 --> 00:57:53,242
Bravo, Tommy!

714
00:57:54,913 --> 00:57:58,117
English carols is very beautiful.

715
00:58:01,253 --> 00:58:02,795
Hey, Tommy.

716
00:58:03,339 --> 00:58:05,462
Hey, are you still there?

717
00:58:05,591 --> 00:58:07,133
- Aye!
- Yeah!

718
00:58:07,259 --> 00:58:09,667
You drink with us, ja?

719
00:58:09,803 --> 00:58:10,966
- Ja!
- Ja!

720
00:58:11,096 --> 00:58:13,670
You like some good deutschen Schnaps?

721
00:58:14,558 --> 00:58:16,883
- That's whisky.
- Yes!

722
00:58:17,019 --> 00:58:18,478
Sling it over!

723
00:58:18,604 --> 00:58:21,937
Tomorrow we meet you in the middle!

724
00:58:22,066 --> 00:58:24,189
Aye, the middle of Piccadilly.

725
00:58:25,569 --> 00:58:27,360
It's funny to hear them speak in English.

726
00:58:27,488 --> 00:58:30,061
Yeah, well, they learned it
all at school, didn't they?

727
00:58:30,199 --> 00:58:32,405
See you in the penalty area!

728
00:58:32,993 --> 00:58:34,820
Happy Christmas!

729
00:58:34,954 --> 00:58:37,705
- Happy Christmas.
- Aye, happy Christmas.

730
00:58:38,749 --> 00:58:40,457
Good night, Jerry.

731
00:58:50,511 --> 00:58:51,673
Ta.

732
00:58:57,309 --> 00:58:58,589
Jim?

733
00:58:59,019 --> 00:59:00,182
Cocoa.

734
00:59:03,607 --> 00:59:04,935
Ooch, ta.

735
00:59:17,663 --> 00:59:18,991
Hey, Jack.

736
00:59:31,927 --> 00:59:33,089
Hey!

737
01:01:51,275 --> 01:01:52,734
Hello, Tommy.

738
01:02:02,953 --> 01:02:04,910
About bloody time, too.

739
01:02:12,671 --> 01:02:13,834
That's good stuff, Jerry.

740
01:02:13,964 --> 01:02:15,672
Aye. Thank you very much.

741
01:02:18,427 --> 01:02:19,590
Fritz.

742
01:02:20,471 --> 01:02:22,214
How are you, Fritz?

743
01:02:22,765 --> 01:02:24,045
Merry Christmas.

744
01:02:24,183 --> 01:02:25,463
Merry Christmas.

745
01:02:25,601 --> 01:02:27,261
How's the Kaiser?

746
01:02:31,565 --> 01:02:32,561
Freuter.

747
01:02:32,691 --> 01:02:34,648
How do you do? Hawkins.

748
01:02:40,324 --> 01:02:42,779
Do you know when the war will end?

749
01:02:42,952 --> 01:02:45,869
After our spring offensive, I should think.

750
01:02:58,467 --> 01:03:00,424
- How are your trenches?
- Terrible.

751
01:03:00,552 --> 01:03:02,212
Not fit for pigs.

752
01:03:02,388 --> 01:03:05,591
When it rains,
we're up to our knees in mud and water.

753
01:03:05,724 --> 01:03:07,931
Arert you sick of the war?

754
01:03:08,894 --> 01:03:11,432
Before the war, I was staying in Suffolk,

755
01:03:11,563 --> 01:03:14,979
and I left there a three-and-one-half
horsepower motorcycle.

756
01:03:15,109 --> 01:03:16,935
And also a girl.

757
01:03:17,277 --> 01:03:18,440
Hey, do you hear that?

758
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:21,275
This chap's got a girlfriend in Suffolk.

759
01:03:21,699 --> 01:03:23,157
You can send her a message,

760
01:03:23,284 --> 01:03:26,119
telling her that I am all right over here.

761
01:03:26,245 --> 01:03:28,237
I mean, I will write name
and address for you.

762
01:03:28,372 --> 01:03:30,411
I suppose it's all right.

763
01:03:37,631 --> 01:03:38,829
Cigarette?

764
01:03:38,966 --> 01:03:40,045
Are they Virginian?

765
01:03:40,175 --> 01:03:41,255
Aye. Straight cut.

766
01:03:41,385 --> 01:03:44,054
Ah, nein, danke. I only smoke Turkish.

767
01:03:44,513 --> 01:03:46,055
Have a cigar.

768
01:03:51,395 --> 01:03:52,391
Thank you.

769
01:03:58,902 --> 01:04:01,228
We will not ever shoot again,

770
01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:03,489
unless you start.

771
01:04:03,615 --> 01:04:05,276
Do you hear that?

772
01:04:05,492 --> 01:04:07,615
That will suit us, man, I can tell you.

773
01:04:07,745 --> 01:04:10,662
Here. We'll drink to that.

774
01:04:13,125 --> 01:04:15,794
That is Scottish schnapps.

775
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:21,214
This is your guns that are shooting?

776
01:04:21,341 --> 01:04:24,212
No. It's the bastard English, not us.

777
01:04:25,179 --> 01:04:27,019
They will not shoot at us
while you are here.

778
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:27,980
Don't believe that, man.

779
01:04:28,057 --> 01:04:30,180
It's us they're shooting at.

780
01:04:30,309 --> 01:04:31,803
Oh, well...

781
01:04:32,352 --> 01:04:33,930
Thanks very much, mate,

782
01:04:34,062 --> 01:04:36,139
and give my love to the Kaiser.

783
01:05:10,808 --> 01:05:12,516
- Morning, sir.
- Right. Carry on.

784
01:05:12,643 --> 01:05:13,923
Yes, sir.

785
01:05:16,772 --> 01:05:18,432
Morning, sir.

786
01:05:19,024 --> 01:05:20,352
Well done.

787
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:25,730
Fraternisation, you call it?

788
01:05:25,989 --> 01:05:28,148
It could be interpreted as treason.

789
01:05:28,325 --> 01:05:30,318
We could have them all shot.

790
01:05:31,078 --> 01:05:34,613
Stop the leaves of all units
in any sector where it's happened.

791
01:05:35,582 --> 01:05:38,074
And a happy New Year to you, too.

792
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,922
Come on. Come on, quickly.

793
01:05:56,937 --> 01:05:59,772
Brother Bertie went away

794
01:05:59,898 --> 01:06:02,816
To do his bit the other day

795
01:06:02,943 --> 01:06:04,437
With a smile on his lips

796
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:06,064
And his lieutenant pips

797
01:06:06,196 --> 01:06:08,901
Upon his shoulder bright and gay

798
01:06:09,033 --> 01:06:11,606
As the train moved out he said

799
01:06:11,952 --> 01:06:14,490
Remember me to all the birds.

800
01:06:15,122 --> 01:06:18,123
Then he wagged his paw and went away to war

801
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:21,584
Shouting out these pathetic words

802
01:06:21,712 --> 01:06:24,203
Goodbye, goodbye

803
01:06:24,548 --> 01:06:27,419
Wipe the tear, baby dear, from your eye

804
01:06:27,759 --> 01:06:30,381
Though it's hard to part, I know

805
01:06:31,221 --> 01:06:33,677
I'll be tickled to death to go

806
01:06:33,807 --> 01:06:36,477
Don't cry, don't sigh

807
01:06:37,352 --> 01:06:39,808
There's a silver lining in the sky

808
01:06:39,938 --> 01:06:41,314
Bonsoir, old thing

809
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,982
Cheerio, chin-chin

810
01:06:43,108 --> 01:06:45,646
Nap-poo, toodle-oo, goodbye

811
01:06:56,872 --> 01:06:59,494
Brother Bertie went away

812
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:02,376
To do his bit the other day

813
01:07:02,795 --> 01:07:04,372
With a smile on his lips

814
01:07:04,505 --> 01:07:05,785
And his lieutenant pips

815
01:07:05,923 --> 01:07:08,378
Upon his shoulder bright and gay

816
01:07:08,842 --> 01:07:11,416
As the train moved out he said

817
01:07:11,637 --> 01:07:14,638
Remember me to all the birds

818
01:07:14,765 --> 01:07:17,932
Then he wagged his paw and went away to war

819
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:21,760
Shouting out these pathetic words

820
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:23,178
Goodbye

821
01:07:23,691 --> 01:07:24,935
Goodbye

822
01:07:25,192 --> 01:07:27,897
Wipe the tear, baby dear, from your eye

823
01:07:28,028 --> 01:07:31,362
Though it's hard to part, I know

824
01:07:31,615 --> 01:07:34,285
I'll be tickled to death to go

825
01:07:34,409 --> 01:07:37,245
Don't cry, don't sigh

826
01:07:37,829 --> 01:07:40,368
There's a silver lining in the sky

827
01:07:40,541 --> 01:07:42,165
Bonsoir, old thing

828
01:07:42,292 --> 01:07:43,703
Cheerio, chin-chin

829
01:07:43,836 --> 01:07:47,370
Nap-poo, toodle-oo, goodbye

830
01:07:48,424 --> 01:07:50,048
Goodbye

831
01:07:50,175 --> 01:07:51,207
Goodbye

832
01:07:51,343 --> 01:07:54,130
Wipe the tear, baby dear, from your eye

833
01:07:54,346 --> 01:07:57,016
Though it's hard to part, I know

834
01:07:57,808 --> 01:08:00,346
I'll be tickled to death to go

835
01:08:00,477 --> 01:08:03,395
Don't cry, don't sigh

836
01:08:04,023 --> 01:08:06,774
There's a silver lining in the sky

837
01:08:06,942 --> 01:08:08,484
Bonsoir, old thing

838
01:08:08,610 --> 01:08:10,188
Cheerio, chin-chin

839
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,728
Nap-poo, toodle-oo, goodbye

840
01:08:34,094 --> 01:08:37,179
Oh, oh, oh, it's a lovely war

841
01:08:37,306 --> 01:08:38,966
Who wouldn't be a soldier, eh?

842
01:08:39,099 --> 01:08:41,306
Oh, it's a shame to take the pay

843
01:08:41,435 --> 01:08:43,178
As soon as reveille is gone

844
01:08:43,312 --> 01:08:44,475
We feel just as heavy as lead

845
01:08:44,605 --> 01:08:46,514
But we never get up till the sergeant

846
01:08:46,648 --> 01:08:48,725
Brings our breakfast up to bed

847
01:08:48,859 --> 01:08:51,860
Oh, oh, oh, it's a lovely war

848
01:08:52,029 --> 01:08:53,903
Oh, what do we want with eggs and ham

849
01:08:54,031 --> 01:08:56,023
When we've got plum and apple jam?

850
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:58,198
Form fours, right turn

851
01:08:58,327 --> 01:08:59,952
How shall we spend the money we earn?

852
01:09:00,079 --> 01:09:03,033
Oh, oh, oh, it's a lovely war

853
01:09:03,457 --> 01:09:05,580
Up to your waist in water

854
01:09:05,709 --> 01:09:07,417
Up to your eyes in slush

855
01:09:07,544 --> 01:09:09,122
Using the kind of language

856
01:09:09,254 --> 01:09:10,832
That makes the sergeant blush

857
01:09:10,964 --> 01:09:12,756
Who wouldn't join the army?

858
01:09:12,883 --> 01:09:14,591
That's what we all inquire

859
01:09:14,718 --> 01:09:16,545
Don't we pity the poor civilian

860
01:09:16,679 --> 01:09:18,338
Sitting beside the fire?

861
01:09:21,475 --> 01:09:22,933
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

862
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:24,768
It's a lovely war

863
01:09:24,895 --> 01:09:25,974
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

864
01:09:26,104 --> 01:09:27,812
It's a lovely war

865
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:29,564
Who wouldn't be a soldier, eh?

866
01:09:29,691 --> 01:09:31,933
Oh, it's a shame to take the pay

867
01:09:32,069 --> 01:09:34,061
As soon as reveille is gone

868
01:09:34,196 --> 01:09:35,607
We feel just as heavy as lead

869
01:09:35,739 --> 01:09:37,447
But we never get up till the sergeant

870
01:09:37,575 --> 01:09:39,900
Brings our breakfast up to bed

871
01:09:43,288 --> 01:09:45,198
Oh, oh

872
01:09:45,332 --> 01:09:47,159
It's a lovely war

873
01:09:50,796 --> 01:09:52,872
What do we want with eggs and ham

874
01:09:53,007 --> 01:09:55,082
When we've got plum and apple jam?

875
01:09:55,217 --> 01:09:56,877
Form fours

876
01:09:57,177 --> 01:09:58,720
Right turn

877
01:09:59,096 --> 01:10:00,923
How shall we spend the money we earn?

878
01:10:01,056 --> 01:10:03,215
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

879
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:04,631
It's a lovely

880
01:10:04,768 --> 01:10:06,891
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

881
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:08,349
It's a lovely

882
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:11,730
Oh, oh, oh, it's a lovely war

883
01:10:15,195 --> 01:10:17,947
Happy New Year!

884
01:10:26,707 --> 01:10:27,822
Smithey!

885
01:10:27,958 --> 01:10:29,156
Smithey!

886
01:10:29,293 --> 01:10:30,953
Hello, Mavis.

887
01:10:31,837 --> 01:10:33,545
Morning, Sir John.

888
01:10:35,716 --> 01:10:38,551
Oh, Smith. Been wounded, I see.

889
01:10:38,677 --> 01:10:41,215
Yes. Got a blighty one at Mons, sir.

890
01:10:41,347 --> 01:10:43,802
Yes, yes. Well, the wife
must be glad to have you home.

891
01:10:43,933 --> 01:10:45,724
I'm not married yet, sir.

892
01:10:45,851 --> 01:10:48,389
Oh, no, no. Of course not. It was your...

893
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:49,765
Brother, sir.

894
01:10:49,897 --> 01:10:51,011
Jack.

895
01:10:51,481 --> 01:10:52,940
Married Cook's daughter, sir.

896
01:10:53,066 --> 01:10:54,346
Yes. That's right. That's right.

897
01:10:54,404 --> 01:10:56,204
They've got a dear little boy,
haven't they?

898
01:10:56,205 --> 01:10:58,436
Yeah. A little girl actually, sir. Emma.

899
01:10:58,572 --> 01:11:00,778
Rest of the family all right?

900
01:11:00,908 --> 01:11:02,532
Well, touch wood, sir.

901
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:04,652
Got five at the front now, sir.

902
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,401
Well done. Well done.

903
01:11:06,538 --> 01:11:08,116
Nothing like a bit of shooting, eh?

904
01:11:08,248 --> 01:11:09,494
No, sir.

905
01:11:09,875 --> 01:11:11,499
Well, I must be off.

906
01:11:11,627 --> 01:11:13,454
August the 12th tomorrow.

907
01:11:13,587 --> 01:11:16,292
Grouse won't wait.
Keep up the good work.

908
01:11:16,423 --> 01:11:18,215
- Yes, sir.
- All right, then.

909
01:11:18,425 --> 01:11:22,008
- Everything all right up there, Mavis?
- I'm attending to it, sir.

910
01:11:23,639 --> 01:11:27,055
Well, look, come
and see me in a month or so.

911
01:11:27,184 --> 01:11:29,935
We might do something
about getting your old job back.

912
01:11:30,062 --> 01:11:33,022
- What do you say to that?
- Well, if I can't get back to the front, sir,

913
01:11:33,088 --> 01:11:34,808
I think I'd sooner have a job in munitions,

914
01:11:34,942 --> 01:11:37,065
if it's all the same to you, sir.

915
01:11:37,361 --> 01:11:39,353
As you wish...

916
01:11:39,530 --> 01:11:40,774
Jack.

917
01:11:42,199 --> 01:11:43,907
Drive on, Mavis.

918
01:12:06,473 --> 01:12:08,051
That's better.

919
01:12:08,183 --> 01:12:10,509
Right, lads. You can
take your masks off now.

920
01:12:10,644 --> 01:12:12,471
Masks off! Stand down!

921
01:12:12,729 --> 01:12:13,892
Not you, Leary.

922
01:12:14,022 --> 01:12:15,814
- Sentry.
- Yes, Sarge.

923
01:12:18,527 --> 01:12:20,187
Bombed last night

924
01:12:20,529 --> 01:12:22,652
And bombed the night before

925
01:12:22,907 --> 01:12:24,365
Gonna be bombed tonight

926
01:12:24,492 --> 01:12:26,733
If we never get bombed anymore

927
01:12:27,286 --> 01:12:29,160
When we're bombed

928
01:12:29,288 --> 01:12:31,530
We're scared as we can be

929
01:12:31,748 --> 01:12:33,706
God strafe the bombing men

930
01:12:33,834 --> 01:12:35,578
From higher Germany

931
01:12:35,711 --> 01:12:37,870
They're over us

932
01:12:38,005 --> 01:12:40,377
They're over us

933
01:12:40,633 --> 01:12:41,877
One shell hole

934
01:12:42,009 --> 01:12:44,761
For just the four of us

935
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:46,251
Thank your lucky stars

936
01:12:46,388 --> 01:12:48,760
There are no more of us

937
01:12:49,183 --> 01:12:50,297
'Cause one of us

938
01:12:50,434 --> 01:12:53,221
Could fill it all alone

939
01:12:53,687 --> 01:12:55,478
Gassed last night

940
01:12:55,856 --> 01:12:57,979
And gassed the night before

941
01:12:58,317 --> 01:12:59,727
Going to get gassed tonight

942
01:12:59,860 --> 01:13:02,433
If we never get gassed anymore

943
01:13:02,655 --> 01:13:04,564
When we're gassed

944
01:13:04,740 --> 01:13:06,816
We're sick as we can be

945
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:09,157
'Cause phosgene and mustard gas

946
01:13:09,286 --> 01:13:10,911
Is much too much for me

947
01:13:11,038 --> 01:13:13,077
They're warning us

948
01:13:13,206 --> 01:13:15,449
They're warning us

949
01:13:15,959 --> 01:13:20,004
One respirator for the four of us

950
01:13:20,172 --> 01:13:21,666
Thank your lucky stars

951
01:13:21,799 --> 01:13:24,468
That three of us can run

952
01:13:24,593 --> 01:13:28,722
So one of us can use it all alone

953
01:13:29,557 --> 01:13:31,015
Hey, Sarge.

954
01:13:35,437 --> 01:13:37,560
Right, lads, on your feet! Attention!

955
01:13:37,689 --> 01:13:40,774
It's me cousin Bertie,
the only officer in the family.

956
01:13:41,318 --> 01:13:44,438
Have you got
the trench consolidated, Sergeant?

957
01:13:46,699 --> 01:13:48,442
All present and correct, sir.

958
01:13:48,576 --> 01:13:50,948
Except we lost Mr Laver, sir.

959
01:13:52,454 --> 01:13:53,913
That's bad.

960
01:13:54,456 --> 01:13:57,078
Major Mallory wants to
have a word with the men.

961
01:13:57,209 --> 01:13:59,617
You can stand the men at ease, Sergeant.

962
01:13:59,753 --> 01:14:01,164
Stand at ease!

963
01:14:01,296 --> 01:14:02,459
Shell attack!

964
01:14:02,590 --> 01:14:03,834
On your feet, lads.

965
01:14:03,966 --> 01:14:05,709
Come on! Jump to it!

966
01:14:06,343 --> 01:14:09,048
You can let the men smoke if they want to.

967
01:14:09,179 --> 01:14:10,294
Right, sir.

968
01:14:10,431 --> 01:14:12,091
The major says you can smoke,

969
01:14:12,224 --> 01:14:14,347
but don't let me catch you.

970
01:14:14,977 --> 01:14:16,435
Now, you men,

971
01:14:17,104 --> 01:14:20,852
I've just come
from having a powwow with the Colonel.

972
01:14:21,358 --> 01:14:24,193
We think you've done some damn fine work.

973
01:14:24,695 --> 01:14:26,486
We congratulate you.

974
01:14:27,615 --> 01:14:30,569
I know you've had it pretty hard
the last few days,

975
01:14:30,701 --> 01:14:33,536
bombs, shells and snipers.

976
01:14:33,662 --> 01:14:37,577
We haven't escaped scot-free
back at staff either, I can tell you.

977
01:14:37,708 --> 01:14:40,199
Anyway, we're all here...

978
01:14:40,669 --> 01:14:42,875
Well, not all of us of course,

979
01:14:43,005 --> 01:14:46,041
and that gas of ours was rather nasty,

980
01:14:46,175 --> 01:14:47,918
damn wind changing.

981
01:14:48,761 --> 01:14:50,255
Yes, indeed, sir.

982
01:14:50,387 --> 01:14:53,305
But these mishaps do happen in war,

983
01:14:53,432 --> 01:14:57,216
and gas can be a war-winning weapon.

984
01:14:57,853 --> 01:15:01,019
Anyway, so long as we can all keep smiling,

985
01:15:01,732 --> 01:15:04,187
you're white men all.

986
01:15:05,653 --> 01:15:07,775
Sector all tidy now, Smith?

987
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:11,109
We've buried most
of the 2nd Yorks and Lancs, sir.

988
01:15:11,242 --> 01:15:14,278
Still a few DLI's
and the men from our own company left.

989
01:15:14,411 --> 01:15:15,574
I see.

990
01:15:15,912 --> 01:15:19,079
Well, look, let the lads drum up some cha.

991
01:15:19,291 --> 01:15:21,118
- Look out!
- Look out, sir!

992
01:15:26,215 --> 01:15:27,590
Good God.

993
01:15:27,716 --> 01:15:28,712
Stretcher bearers!

994
01:15:29,093 --> 01:15:31,381
Stretcher bearers! Stretcher bearers!

995
01:15:31,887 --> 01:15:33,844
You have no stretcher bearers over there?

996
01:15:33,972 --> 01:15:36,214
No. I'm afraid
they went in the last attack, sir.

997
01:15:36,350 --> 01:15:38,259
I'm waiting for reliefs from HQ.

998
01:15:38,393 --> 01:15:40,682
Oh, well, they're stout chaps.

999
01:15:42,439 --> 01:15:44,811
Yes. You better
let the men keep under cover.

1000
01:15:44,942 --> 01:15:46,057
Thank you, sir.

1001
01:15:46,193 --> 01:15:47,568
Take cover!

1002
01:15:47,736 --> 01:15:50,108
Damn place still reeks
of decomposing bodies.

1003
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:51,697
I'm afraid it's unavoidable, sir.

1004
01:15:51,824 --> 01:15:53,344
The trench was mainly full of Jerries.

1005
01:15:53,367 --> 01:15:54,565
Yes, of course.

1006
01:15:54,702 --> 01:15:56,662
You were more or less sharing
the same frontline

1007
01:15:56,663 --> 01:15:58,583
- for a couple of days, werert you?
- Yes, sir.

1008
01:15:58,584 --> 01:15:59,528
Oh, well.

1009
01:15:59,665 --> 01:16:01,788
- Carry on, Smith.
- Thank you, sir.

1010
01:16:05,170 --> 01:16:06,713
Ye gods. What's that?

1011
01:16:07,297 --> 01:16:09,005
It's a Jerry, sir.

1012
01:16:09,591 --> 01:16:10,789
What?

1013
01:16:10,926 --> 01:16:12,206
It's a leg, sir.

1014
01:16:12,803 --> 01:16:14,594
Well, get rid of it, man.

1015
01:16:14,722 --> 01:16:17,592
You can't have an obstruction
sticking out of the parapet like that.

1016
01:16:17,725 --> 01:16:18,756
Yes, sir.

1017
01:16:19,351 --> 01:16:20,893
- Sergeant Smith.
- Sir.

1018
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,062
Remove the offending limb.

1019
01:16:23,188 --> 01:16:25,268
We can't do that, sir.
It's holding up the parapet.

1020
01:16:25,357 --> 01:16:27,849
Besides, we've just
consolidated the position.

1021
01:16:27,985 --> 01:16:31,401
Yes, well, you heard what the Major
said. Just get a shovel and hack it off.

1022
01:16:32,322 --> 01:16:33,782
Right, Bertie, sir.

1023
01:16:34,950 --> 01:16:38,236
Where the bloody hell am I
going to hang me equipment now?

1024
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:40,115
Right, lads! Brew up!

1025
01:16:40,247 --> 01:16:42,287
Get yourselves some cha!

1026
01:17:08,525 --> 01:17:09,936
Smithey.

1027
01:17:10,068 --> 01:17:13,105
Johnny's regiment's
doing rather well for themselves.

1028
01:17:14,031 --> 01:17:15,359
Champagne, dear?

1029
01:17:15,533 --> 01:17:17,691
Let me give you a glass of wine.

1030
01:17:17,826 --> 01:17:19,404
There you are.

1031
01:17:29,129 --> 01:17:31,122
Field Marshal Sir John French,

1032
01:17:31,256 --> 01:17:34,542
Commander in Chief
of the British Expeditionary Force.

1033
01:17:36,887 --> 01:17:39,841
Wasrt that Sir Douglas Haig, the new man?

1034
01:17:40,307 --> 01:17:41,885
Damned upstart.

1035
01:17:42,184 --> 01:17:44,757
That other blighter Robertsors here, too.

1036
01:17:44,895 --> 01:17:47,101
Intrigue upon intrigue.

1037
01:17:55,948 --> 01:17:57,442
General Sir William Robertson,

1038
01:17:57,575 --> 01:18:00,361
Chief of the Imperial General Staff!

1039
01:18:00,577 --> 01:18:03,246
Willy, I'm so thrilled

1040
01:18:03,372 --> 01:18:05,199
to hear about your new appointment.

1041
01:18:05,332 --> 01:18:08,001
One takes these things
as they come, you know.

1042
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:10,618
Sir Henry Wilsors green with envy.

1043
01:18:10,754 --> 01:18:11,999
Quite.

1044
01:18:14,717 --> 01:18:16,425
Talk of the devil.

1045
01:18:18,262 --> 01:18:20,587
I've nothing against Robertson personally,

1046
01:18:20,723 --> 01:18:24,341
but to make him CIGS is absolute disaster.

1047
01:18:24,476 --> 01:18:26,220
I'm sure Haig doesn't think so.

1048
01:18:26,353 --> 01:18:29,686
Well, of course he doesn't.
Now Haig can do exactly as he likes.

1049
01:18:29,815 --> 01:18:31,854
I can see that perfectly well.

1050
01:18:41,494 --> 01:18:42,869
General Sir Douglas Haig,

1051
01:18:42,995 --> 01:18:45,237
Commander of the British First Army,

1052
01:18:45,372 --> 01:18:46,701
and Lady Haig.

1053
01:18:47,708 --> 01:18:49,415
Canter in the row before breaffast

1054
01:18:49,543 --> 01:18:51,832
- tomorrow morning, Dorothy?
- Lovely.

1055
01:18:52,337 --> 01:18:54,497
Don't forget
the fitting for your new boots, Douglas.

1056
01:18:54,590 --> 01:18:55,669
Yes.

1057
01:18:56,967 --> 01:18:58,627
By the way,

1058
01:18:58,761 --> 01:19:00,836
we're lunching at Number 10,

1059
01:19:01,597 --> 01:19:03,589
without Sir John French.

1060
01:19:04,308 --> 01:19:07,142
Congratulations, my dear.

1061
01:19:12,983 --> 01:19:14,264
It's wise to remember

1062
01:19:14,401 --> 01:19:16,440
Haig has powerful friends.

1063
01:19:16,570 --> 01:19:18,942
What on earth do they see in him?

1064
01:19:19,073 --> 01:19:21,480
Shoots pheasant with the Prince of Wales.

1065
01:19:21,617 --> 01:19:23,609
Lady Dorothy was one of Queen Alexandra's

1066
01:19:23,744 --> 01:19:25,535
- maids of honour.
- Was she?

1067
01:19:25,662 --> 01:19:28,284
So now, of course,
he has the ear of the King.

1068
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:29,703
Haig?

1069
01:19:29,833 --> 01:19:32,407
Sir Douglas Haig. That name's familiar.

1070
01:19:33,545 --> 01:19:34,874
Whisky.

1071
01:19:35,923 --> 01:19:37,085
Trade?

1072
01:19:37,216 --> 01:19:38,544
Afraid so.

1073
01:19:38,801 --> 01:19:41,007
Remember Geoffrey?
He was Ralph's ADC in Delhi.

1074
01:19:41,136 --> 01:19:42,132
Of course.

1075
01:19:42,262 --> 01:19:44,718
Excuse me, sir.
May I ask Lady Haig to dance?

1076
01:19:44,848 --> 01:19:46,224
I should be delighted.

1077
01:19:46,350 --> 01:19:49,304
Could we have
a few words together, Douglas?

1078
01:19:49,561 --> 01:19:51,186
The trouble is that people back here

1079
01:19:51,313 --> 01:19:53,685
just don't realise there's a war on.

1080
01:19:53,816 --> 01:19:55,475
That's why we need conscription.

1081
01:19:55,609 --> 01:19:57,233
Well, I've just volunteered.

1082
01:19:57,361 --> 01:19:59,733
Oh, wonderful. Congratulations.

1083
01:19:59,863 --> 01:20:01,026
What for?

1084
01:20:01,156 --> 01:20:02,615
The VAD.

1085
01:20:02,991 --> 01:20:04,616
The uniform is so becoming.

1086
01:20:04,743 --> 01:20:07,448
I wish there were more people like you.

1087
01:20:08,830 --> 01:20:10,657
I will tell you in confidence, my dear.

1088
01:20:10,791 --> 01:20:12,250
His Majesty very much hopes

1089
01:20:12,376 --> 01:20:14,867
that my husband
will succeed Sir John French.

1090
01:20:15,003 --> 01:20:15,999
My God.

1091
01:20:16,129 --> 01:20:17,245
Douglas has always felt

1092
01:20:17,381 --> 01:20:20,251
that French
was quite unsuitable to the position.

1093
01:20:23,887 --> 01:20:27,138
What do you think
of French's little lady friend?

1094
01:20:28,392 --> 01:20:29,672
Rank outsider.

1095
01:20:29,810 --> 01:20:31,055
Is she?

1096
01:20:31,645 --> 01:20:33,472
He's always been

1097
01:20:33,730 --> 01:20:35,688
very generous with the ladies.

1098
01:20:35,816 --> 01:20:39,350
I heard he once borrowed
rather a lot of money from you.

1099
01:20:39,486 --> 01:20:42,570
He was commander
of my cavalry brigade at the time.

1100
01:20:42,698 --> 01:20:44,358
Damn bad form.

1101
01:20:44,492 --> 01:20:45,820
Appalling.

1102
01:20:49,996 --> 01:20:51,112
Haig.

1103
01:20:57,170 --> 01:20:58,451
Sir John.

1104
01:20:59,256 --> 01:21:01,462
Do you know Mrs...

1105
01:21:05,179 --> 01:21:07,551
Comrades

1106
01:21:07,932 --> 01:21:10,387
Comrades

1107
01:21:10,517 --> 01:21:15,096
Ever since they were boys

1108
01:21:15,606 --> 01:21:20,944
Sharing each other's sorrows

1109
01:21:21,070 --> 01:21:25,363
Sharing each other's joys

1110
01:21:25,490 --> 01:21:27,650
The right man in the right job,
if I may say so, sir.

1111
01:21:27,785 --> 01:21:29,943
You may. You may. Thank you, my man.

1112
01:21:30,079 --> 01:21:32,700
To friends in sunshine and shadow.

1113
01:21:32,831 --> 01:21:35,370
- What? What?
- Hear, hear.

1114
01:21:38,545 --> 01:21:40,917
Well, Douglas,

1115
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:43,167
how did you leave the men at the front?

1116
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:44,794
Oh, in fine heart, sir.

1117
01:21:44,927 --> 01:21:47,002
Just spoiling for a fight.

1118
01:21:47,221 --> 01:21:49,260
Makes one feel very proud.

1119
01:21:49,390 --> 01:21:51,299
Tell me, Douglas,

1120
01:21:51,767 --> 01:21:54,804
what do you think
of this fellow, Kitchener?

1121
01:21:55,312 --> 01:21:56,807
Well, sir...

1122
01:21:57,064 --> 01:21:58,345
Yes, yes.

1123
01:21:58,524 --> 01:22:01,015
A perfectly howling rotter.
You're far too nice to say so.

1124
01:22:01,151 --> 01:22:02,859
He's only a damned politician,

1125
01:22:02,986 --> 01:22:06,071
and he behaves
like some damned generalissimo.

1126
01:22:06,198 --> 01:22:09,448
You know he turned up
in Paris in his uniform?

1127
01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:11,995
My God.

1128
01:22:12,454 --> 01:22:14,494
The fellow's got no right
to a uniform at all.

1129
01:22:14,623 --> 01:22:16,616
I mean, he's Secretary of State for War.

1130
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:18,209
What happened?

1131
01:22:18,335 --> 01:22:20,956
Well, it raised
some pretty ticklish points of protocol.

1132
01:22:21,088 --> 01:22:22,568
We'll have to do something about him.

1133
01:22:22,673 --> 01:22:23,753
I mean, he's more dangerous

1134
01:22:23,882 --> 01:22:27,251
than the whole of the damned
German General Staff.

1135
01:22:28,721 --> 01:22:29,883
What?

1136
01:22:30,556 --> 01:22:31,884
Johnny.

1137
01:22:32,016 --> 01:22:33,558
Mrs...

1138
01:22:34,267 --> 01:22:35,466
Johnny.

1139
01:22:35,769 --> 01:22:38,723
Excuse me. They're playing my tune.

1140
01:22:54,496 --> 01:22:56,572
How did Haig get where he is?

1141
01:22:56,707 --> 01:22:59,873
Didrt you tell me he failed the
staff college-entrance examinations?

1142
01:23:00,002 --> 01:23:01,959
- Duke of Cambridge.
- What?

1143
01:23:02,087 --> 01:23:03,368
Friend of the family.

1144
01:23:03,505 --> 01:23:05,130
Oh, yes, of course.

1145
01:23:05,257 --> 01:23:06,668
On her side.

1146
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,422
They waived the formalities and let him in.

1147
01:23:09,553 --> 01:23:11,676
He's quite bright, though.

1148
01:23:11,805 --> 01:23:13,597
Thorough sort of chap.

1149
01:23:13,724 --> 01:23:15,551
Ambitious, of course,

1150
01:23:16,185 --> 01:23:17,465
but means well.

1151
01:23:17,602 --> 01:23:18,978
You off, Henry?

1152
01:23:19,104 --> 01:23:21,227
- Afraid so, Douglas.
- So soon?

1153
01:23:21,356 --> 01:23:23,598
We hope to see you
next weekend at Isabel's.

1154
01:23:23,734 --> 01:23:25,276
Lovely.

1155
01:23:25,402 --> 01:23:27,727
Do come along, dear,
or we shall never get home.

1156
01:23:27,863 --> 01:23:30,354
- Good night, Douglas.
- Good night, Henry.

1157
01:23:34,119 --> 01:23:36,575
I'm quite sure we've met before,
but I can't remember where.

1158
01:23:36,705 --> 01:23:38,994
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Julius.

1159
01:23:39,708 --> 01:23:42,543
Frankly, I'm quite
looking forward to the new year.

1160
01:23:42,669 --> 01:23:44,543
Hurs on his last legs.

1161
01:23:44,671 --> 01:23:47,079
- It should all be over in a few months.
- Yes.

1162
01:23:47,216 --> 01:23:49,125
By the way, Douglas,

1163
01:23:49,301 --> 01:23:51,590
pity about that letter to The Times.

1164
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:54,805
After all, you did capture Loos, hmm?

1165
01:23:54,932 --> 01:23:57,257
Yes. I could have done
with some more support.

1166
01:23:57,392 --> 01:24:00,097
Well, I mean, you can always count on mine.

1167
01:24:00,228 --> 01:24:02,102
- Good night, my dear.
- Good night.

1168
01:24:02,231 --> 01:24:04,031
- Good night, Douglas.
- Good night, Johnny.

1169
01:24:04,032 --> 01:24:07,482
Sir John French's carriage!
Sir John French's carriage!

1170
01:24:07,778 --> 01:24:10,482
That mars a terrible intriguer.

1171
01:24:11,407 --> 01:24:13,648
You've been loyal long enough, my dear.

1172
01:24:13,784 --> 01:24:15,113
Well...

1173
01:24:16,036 --> 01:24:18,871
Number 10 tomorrow, Dorothy.

1174
01:24:19,081 --> 01:24:20,990
And a Field Marshal's job for you.

1175
01:24:21,124 --> 01:24:25,833
Sir Douglas Haig's carriage!
Sir Douglas Haig's carriage!

1176
01:24:54,992 --> 01:24:55,242
Hush.

1177
01:24:55,243 --> 01:24:56,108
Hush.

1178
01:24:56,243 --> 01:24:58,200
Here comes a whizzbang.

1179
01:24:58,996 --> 01:25:00,194
Hush

1180
01:25:00,831 --> 01:25:03,998
Here comes a whizzbang

1181
01:25:04,209 --> 01:25:06,581
Now, you soldier men

1182
01:25:06,712 --> 01:25:08,870
Get down those stairs

1183
01:25:09,047 --> 01:25:11,206
Down in your dugouts

1184
01:25:11,342 --> 01:25:13,914
And say your prayers

1185
01:25:14,344 --> 01:25:15,507
Hush

1186
01:25:15,846 --> 01:25:18,515
Here comes a whizzbang

1187
01:25:18,641 --> 01:25:20,349
And it's making straight for you

1188
01:25:20,475 --> 01:25:21,851
Look out!

1189
01:25:23,687 --> 01:25:26,439
And you'll see all the wonders

1190
01:25:26,565 --> 01:25:28,605
Of no-man's-land

1191
01:25:28,734 --> 01:25:30,561
If a whizzbang

1192
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:32,648
Hits you

1193
01:25:34,531 --> 01:25:35,729
Hush

1194
01:25:36,116 --> 01:25:39,402
- Here comes a whizzbang
- Here comes a whizzbang

1195
01:25:39,537 --> 01:25:40,781
Hush

1196
01:25:41,038 --> 01:25:44,454
- Here comes a whizzbang
- Here comes a whizzbang

1197
01:25:44,583 --> 01:25:46,908
Now, you soldier men

1198
01:25:47,043 --> 01:25:49,286
Get down those stairs

1199
01:25:49,421 --> 01:25:51,414
Down in your dugouts

1200
01:25:51,590 --> 01:25:54,046
And say your prayers

1201
01:25:54,551 --> 01:25:55,631
Hush

1202
01:25:56,095 --> 01:25:58,965
- Here comes a whizzbang
- Here comes a whizzbang

1203
01:25:59,098 --> 01:26:02,882
And it's making straight for you

1204
01:26:03,477 --> 01:26:06,680
And you'll see all the wonders

1205
01:26:06,814 --> 01:26:08,890
Of no-mars-land

1206
01:26:09,024 --> 01:26:10,352
If a whizzbang

1207
01:26:11,735 --> 01:26:12,933
Hits you

1208
01:26:13,070 --> 01:26:15,359
Come on now. Do us a Charlie Chaplin.

1209
01:26:16,782 --> 01:26:18,691
Come on. Let's see you do it.

1210
01:26:47,104 --> 01:26:50,307
And you'll see all the wonders

1211
01:26:50,441 --> 01:26:52,932
Of no-mars-land

1212
01:26:53,068 --> 01:26:56,900
If a whizzbang hits you

1213
01:27:03,245 --> 01:27:04,573
Gentlemen.

1214
01:27:11,879 --> 01:27:13,954
Germany has shot her bolt.

1215
01:27:14,131 --> 01:27:16,800
The prospects for 1916 are excellent.

1216
01:27:17,134 --> 01:27:18,711
Permission to speak, sir.

1217
01:27:18,844 --> 01:27:20,173
Of course.

1218
01:27:21,305 --> 01:27:23,214
If we continue in this way,

1219
01:27:23,349 --> 01:27:25,222
the line of trenches will stretch

1220
01:27:25,350 --> 01:27:27,224
from Switzerland to the sea.

1221
01:27:27,352 --> 01:27:29,808
Neither we nor the Germans
will be able to break through.

1222
01:27:29,938 --> 01:27:32,512
The war will end in complete stalemate.

1223
01:27:32,649 --> 01:27:33,930
Nonsense.

1224
01:27:34,193 --> 01:27:37,644
We need only one more big offensive
to break through and win.

1225
01:27:38,238 --> 01:27:40,195
My troops are of fine quality

1226
01:27:40,324 --> 01:27:43,194
and especially trained
for this type of war.

1227
01:27:43,327 --> 01:27:45,996
This is not war, sir. It is slaughter.

1228
01:27:46,413 --> 01:27:47,955
God is with us.

1229
01:27:48,081 --> 01:27:50,158
It is for King and Empire.

1230
01:27:51,043 --> 01:27:52,667
We are sacrificing lives

1231
01:27:52,794 --> 01:27:56,163
at the rate of
5,000 to sometimes 50,000 a day.

1232
01:27:56,298 --> 01:27:57,757
Intensive bombardment,

1233
01:27:57,883 --> 01:27:59,212
superior morale.

1234
01:27:59,343 --> 01:28:01,170
Just one more battle.

1235
01:28:01,387 --> 01:28:05,135
Sir, tell us what to do,
and by God, we'll do it.

1236
01:28:09,561 --> 01:28:12,516
We're going to walk through
the enemy lines.

1237
01:28:33,919 --> 01:28:35,745
Try this one, Dickie.

1238
01:28:36,255 --> 01:28:38,710
Cor, this is a good one, Grandpa.

1239
01:28:43,262 --> 01:28:45,800
Come on, Dickie, love.
They're all the same.

1240
01:28:50,477 --> 01:28:51,592
Come on.

1241
01:28:53,605 --> 01:28:55,682
Let me look at this one, please.

1242
01:29:01,071 --> 01:29:05,780
There's a long, long trail a-winding

1243
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:10,952
Into the land of my dream

1244
01:29:11,581 --> 01:29:16,493
Where the nightingales are singing

1245
01:29:16,628 --> 01:29:22,168
And a white moon beams

1246
01:29:22,468 --> 01:29:27,177
There's a long, long night of waiting

1247
01:29:27,306 --> 01:29:32,466
Until my dreams all come true

1248
01:29:32,770 --> 01:29:36,103
Till the day when I'll be going...

1249
01:29:36,231 --> 01:29:37,891
- Name?
- Connor.

1250
01:29:38,025 --> 01:29:39,899
- Chellis.
- Holland.

1251
01:29:41,153 --> 01:29:43,395
- Littman.
- Horace.

1252
01:30:18,065 --> 01:30:19,725
Complete victory.

1253
01:30:20,484 --> 01:30:23,022
The destruction of German militarism.

1254
01:30:23,153 --> 01:30:25,146
Victory march on Berlin.

1255
01:30:26,282 --> 01:30:30,326
Slow, deliberate fire is being maintained
on the enemy positions.

1256
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:32,365
At this moment,

1257
01:30:32,496 --> 01:30:34,987
my men are advancing
across no-mars-land

1258
01:30:35,123 --> 01:30:36,582
in full pack,

1259
01:30:36,792 --> 01:30:38,914
dressing from left to right.

1260
01:30:39,294 --> 01:30:41,666
The men are forbidden,
under pain of court-martial,

1261
01:30:41,797 --> 01:30:44,632
to take cover in any shell hole or dugout.

1262
01:30:45,217 --> 01:30:46,759
Their magnificent morale

1263
01:30:46,885 --> 01:30:50,089
will cause the enemy to flee in confusion.

1264
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:53,095
The attack will be driven home
with the bayonet.

1265
01:30:54,726 --> 01:30:56,933
I feel that every step I take

1266
01:30:57,479 --> 01:30:59,721
is guided by the divine will.

1267
01:31:07,990 --> 01:31:10,196
This is most unsatisfactory.

1268
01:31:10,785 --> 01:31:12,693
Where are the Sherwood Foresters?

1269
01:31:12,828 --> 01:31:14,452
This is the latest position.

1270
01:31:14,579 --> 01:31:16,537
- Whisky, sir?
- Thank you.

1271
01:31:17,416 --> 01:31:19,741
Where are the East Lancs on the right?

1272
01:31:19,877 --> 01:31:21,704
Out in no-mars-land.

1273
01:31:22,004 --> 01:31:24,874
They're sluggish
from too much sitting in the trenches.

1274
01:31:25,007 --> 01:31:27,414
Most of them, sir, will never rise again.

1275
01:31:27,551 --> 01:31:29,129
We must break through.

1276
01:31:29,261 --> 01:31:30,803
Regardless of loss, sir?

1277
01:31:30,930 --> 01:31:33,005
The loss of, say, another 300,000 men

1278
01:31:33,140 --> 01:31:35,180
may lead to really great results...

1279
01:31:35,308 --> 01:31:37,598
We lost 30,000 men
before lunchtime yesterday, sir.

1280
01:31:37,728 --> 01:31:41,476
...and will not impede
our ability to continue the offensive.

1281
01:31:42,190 --> 01:31:45,939
In any case, we have to calculate
on another great offensive next year.

1282
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:49,403
If the slackers on the home front
see it our way, sir.

1283
01:31:49,657 --> 01:31:50,771
Quite.

1284
01:31:50,908 --> 01:31:53,150
We are rather short of men, sir.

1285
01:31:53,285 --> 01:31:55,194
Oh? What's left?

1286
01:31:55,329 --> 01:31:57,736
The new chappies
from Ireland have just arrived.

1287
01:31:57,873 --> 01:31:59,036
I see.

1288
01:31:59,332 --> 01:32:01,658
They are a wild, untrained lot.

1289
01:32:01,918 --> 01:32:04,125
Still, they'll be raring
to have a crack at the Boche.

1290
01:32:04,254 --> 01:32:08,382
They've only just got off the train.
Most haven't eaten for 48 hours, sir.

1291
01:32:08,634 --> 01:32:12,252
They're moving against
a weakened and demoralised enemy.

1292
01:32:13,388 --> 01:32:16,888
What they lack in training,
they'll make up for in gallantry.

1293
01:32:17,684 --> 01:32:20,555
Capture the German line
without further delay.

1294
01:32:57,683 --> 01:32:59,426
I think we made it.

1295
01:33:00,519 --> 01:33:02,061
Where are we, Sarge?

1296
01:33:02,312 --> 01:33:04,389
I reckon we've broken into a bit of a lull.

1297
01:33:04,523 --> 01:33:05,638
Yeah.

1298
01:33:06,525 --> 01:33:07,805
Nice, ain't it?

1299
01:33:07,943 --> 01:33:10,351
Aye. And peaceful.

1300
01:33:15,701 --> 01:33:17,160
Sniper.

1301
01:33:17,370 --> 01:33:19,695
I'd keep under cover if I were you.

1302
01:33:19,830 --> 01:33:22,119
Trouble is we've been fighting too well.

1303
01:33:22,249 --> 01:33:23,827
We've arrived ahead of ourselves.

1304
01:33:23,959 --> 01:33:24,750
Yeah.

1305
01:33:24,751 --> 01:33:25,083
Yeah.

1306
01:33:25,502 --> 01:33:26,961
What's that, Sarge?

1307
01:33:27,212 --> 01:33:28,457
What's what?

1308
01:33:28,589 --> 01:33:30,249
It's somebody shouting.

1309
01:33:31,884 --> 01:33:33,426
Hey, look.

1310
01:33:33,552 --> 01:33:36,423
There's some fellow
in that shell hole over there.

1311
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:41,137
- Where?
- There! Do you see him?

1312
01:33:41,643 --> 01:33:42,888
There.

1313
01:33:43,228 --> 01:33:44,509
Back!

1314
01:33:44,646 --> 01:33:45,891
Come back!

1315
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:09,920
Is it one of our boys?

1316
01:34:10,047 --> 01:34:13,083
Can't tell from here. Too far away.

1317
01:34:13,592 --> 01:34:15,750
He must have got it in the last attack.

1318
01:34:15,886 --> 01:34:17,594
Does he want any help then?

1319
01:34:17,721 --> 01:34:20,722
No. He's telling us
to get the hell back out of here.

1320
01:34:21,558 --> 01:34:23,931
Jesus, that's easier said than done.

1321
01:34:24,061 --> 01:34:25,768
You can say that again.

1322
01:34:26,897 --> 01:34:28,936
Keep down, Seamus.

1323
01:34:29,066 --> 01:34:31,936
- Did you see that one?
- It came from our boys!

1324
01:34:33,487 --> 01:34:35,978
- Hey, don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

1325
01:34:40,994 --> 01:34:43,034
Now look what you've done.

1326
01:34:43,497 --> 01:34:45,205
You bloody idiots.

1327
01:34:45,999 --> 01:34:47,577
- Seamus.
- Sarge.

1328
01:34:47,709 --> 01:34:49,537
You're the fastest on your pins.

1329
01:34:49,670 --> 01:34:51,212
Nip back to HQ.

1330
01:34:51,338 --> 01:34:53,710
Tell the artillery
to save their shells for the Jerry,

1331
01:34:53,841 --> 01:34:56,047
and tell them
to raise their bloody sights a bit.

1332
01:34:56,176 --> 01:34:58,548
- Back through all that lot?
- Aye, sure.

1333
01:34:58,887 --> 01:35:00,927
Why, it's hardly nothing at all.

1334
01:35:05,435 --> 01:35:07,715
- Bring us back a couple of wee girls.
- Good luck, lad!

1335
01:35:07,716 --> 01:35:09,396
Good luck, Seamus!

1336
01:35:13,485 --> 01:35:15,608
Well, somebody's got to go.

1337
01:35:15,904 --> 01:35:17,648
Come on. Who's next?

1338
01:35:17,781 --> 01:35:19,655
- I don't mind, Sarge.
- Right.

1339
01:35:20,033 --> 01:35:22,703
Tell them there's hundreds of us
stranded up here in this ridge.

1340
01:35:22,828 --> 01:35:24,571
- And, Driscoll...
- Eh?

1341
01:35:24,704 --> 01:35:25,903
Watch it.

1342
01:35:26,039 --> 01:35:27,498
I'll do that.

1343
01:35:31,503 --> 01:35:33,330
Good luck, buddy.

1344
01:35:41,222 --> 01:35:43,891
If he's been shot now, I'll kill him.

1345
01:35:44,350 --> 01:35:45,844
He has, Sarge.

1346
01:36:04,203 --> 01:36:08,829
Well, I think it's best if we all
stick together in the one spot.

1347
01:36:13,921 --> 01:36:16,459
They've started shelling
for the next attack, Sarge!

1348
01:36:16,590 --> 01:36:18,381
Sit tight, lads.

1349
01:36:20,177 --> 01:36:22,549
We're out of the war now, boys.

1350
01:36:52,626 --> 01:36:54,085
Good morning, Mrs Howard.

1351
01:36:54,211 --> 01:36:55,670
Been at church today?

1352
01:37:08,767 --> 01:37:10,974
Well, I think we'll start.

1353
01:37:12,062 --> 01:37:14,850
I don't think
we're going to need the umbrellas.

1354
01:37:18,110 --> 01:37:21,027
Now, before I talk to you,

1355
01:37:21,238 --> 01:37:23,278
I should like to read you a letter

1356
01:37:23,407 --> 01:37:25,863
from George Bernard Shaw to my mother.

1357
01:37:25,993 --> 01:37:27,452
Aye, aye, aye.

1358
01:37:27,620 --> 01:37:29,060
- Does your father know?
- He says,

1359
01:37:29,162 --> 01:37:30,538
"The men of our country

1360
01:37:30,664 --> 01:37:34,911
"are being sacrificed
by the blunders of boobies,

1361
01:37:35,419 --> 01:37:37,707
"the cupidity of capitalists,

1362
01:37:38,005 --> 01:37:40,460
"the ambition of conquerors,

1363
01:37:40,758 --> 01:37:43,593
"the lusts and lies and rancours

1364
01:37:43,719 --> 01:37:46,803
"of blood thirsts who love the war

1365
01:37:46,931 --> 01:37:49,386
"because it opens their prison doors

1366
01:37:49,516 --> 01:37:53,893
"and sets them on the throne
of power and popularity."

1367
01:37:54,271 --> 01:37:55,682
Now give us a song!

1368
01:37:55,814 --> 01:37:59,017
For the second time, peace is being offered

1369
01:37:59,151 --> 01:38:02,401
to the sorely tired people
of the civilised world!

1370
01:38:02,529 --> 01:38:03,858
I don't like the title.

1371
01:38:03,989 --> 01:38:05,567
At the close of 1915,

1372
01:38:05,699 --> 01:38:08,784
President Wilson offered
an immediate armistice

1373
01:38:08,911 --> 01:38:10,535
to be followed by a peace conference.

1374
01:38:10,662 --> 01:38:12,222
Don't think much of the words, neither.

1375
01:38:12,247 --> 01:38:14,204
And in April of this year,

1376
01:38:14,333 --> 01:38:16,871
Germany herself proposed peace.

1377
01:38:17,002 --> 01:38:19,494
How do you know?
Got friends over there?

1378
01:38:20,047 --> 01:38:25,207
The exact terms of Germany's offer
have never been made known to us,

1379
01:38:25,344 --> 01:38:29,389
and I should like to ask Lloyd George
what his war aims are.

1380
01:38:29,515 --> 01:38:33,264
And I should like to ask you
what your old man has for dinner.

1381
01:38:33,394 --> 01:38:38,980
The politicians chatter like imbeciles
while civilisation bleeds to death.

1382
01:38:39,108 --> 01:38:41,183
Now you're talking like a traitor.

1383
01:38:41,318 --> 01:38:42,978
Pacifists is traitors.

1384
01:38:43,112 --> 01:38:44,938
I ask this gentleman...

1385
01:38:45,072 --> 01:38:48,156
Don't ask me. I don't know nothing.
I'm stupid.

1386
01:38:48,284 --> 01:38:53,159
...to consider the plight of
the civilised world after another year.

1387
01:38:53,497 --> 01:38:56,830
You do not know what you do.

1388
01:38:56,958 --> 01:39:00,410
And the statesmen
wash their hands of the whole affair.

1389
01:39:00,545 --> 01:39:02,752
Why don't you wash your face?

1390
01:39:02,881 --> 01:39:05,918
Old Douglas Haig's got them on the run!
He's got them going!

1391
01:39:06,051 --> 01:39:07,794
Who tells you this?

1392
01:39:08,053 --> 01:39:09,962
The newspapers.

1393
01:39:10,097 --> 01:39:13,264
Who refuse to publish the pacifist letters,

1394
01:39:13,433 --> 01:39:17,681
who distort the facts
about our so-called victories.

1395
01:39:18,105 --> 01:39:21,391
We are killing off, slowly but surely,

1396
01:39:21,525 --> 01:39:23,683
the best in the male population!

1397
01:39:23,819 --> 01:39:26,357
Here, don't you address them words to me!

1398
01:39:26,488 --> 01:39:31,862
The sons of Europe are being crucified
on the barbed wire

1399
01:39:32,036 --> 01:39:37,825
because you misguided masses
are crying out for it!

1400
01:39:37,958 --> 01:39:41,042
- Her boy's at the front!
- My boy's at the front!

1401
01:39:41,795 --> 01:39:44,084
War cannot be won!

1402
01:39:44,214 --> 01:39:46,254
No one can win a war.

1403
01:39:47,050 --> 01:39:51,345
Is it your wish this war will go on and on

1404
01:39:51,472 --> 01:39:54,841
until Germany is beaten into the ground?

1405
01:40:15,912 --> 01:40:19,578
Rule, Britannia Britannia rules the waves

1406
01:40:19,708 --> 01:40:24,287
Britons, never, never, never
shall be slaves

1407
01:40:24,630 --> 01:40:29,126
Rule, Britannia Britannia rules the waves

1408
01:40:29,385 --> 01:40:33,465
Britons, never, never, never
shall be slaves

1409
01:40:56,579 --> 01:41:00,113
I don't want to go to war

1410
01:41:00,666 --> 01:41:02,908
I'd rather stay at home

1411
01:41:03,043 --> 01:41:05,369
Around the streets to roam

1412
01:41:05,504 --> 01:41:11,293
And live on the earnings of a lady typist

1413
01:41:11,426 --> 01:41:15,839
I don't want a bayonet in me belly

1414
01:41:16,223 --> 01:41:19,972
I don't want me bollocks shot away

1415
01:41:20,644 --> 01:41:22,933
I'd rather stay in England

1416
01:41:23,063 --> 01:41:25,601
In merry, merry England

1417
01:41:25,732 --> 01:41:31,272
And fornicate me bleeding life away

1418
01:41:32,740 --> 01:41:35,859
Now, then, my lads, move along there.

1419
01:41:36,076 --> 01:41:39,030
No need to make a nuisance of yourselves.

1420
01:41:44,668 --> 01:41:47,206
Well, where can we go, eh?

1421
01:41:48,422 --> 01:41:50,082
My sister-in-law Flo's place.

1422
01:41:50,215 --> 01:41:53,750
Your sister-in-law Flo
will talk about food rationing.

1423
01:41:54,011 --> 01:41:55,291
Then we go round to the boozer,

1424
01:41:55,429 --> 01:41:57,920
and old Charlie
will talk about the zeppelins.

1425
01:41:58,057 --> 01:42:01,058
Then we go down the street, and I'll say...

1426
01:42:01,184 --> 01:42:03,426
I'll say, "What shall we do?"

1427
01:42:03,562 --> 01:42:04,725
And you say,

1428
01:42:04,855 --> 01:42:08,307
"Let's go to
my sister-in-law Flo's place."

1429
01:42:08,442 --> 01:42:10,315
And we get down there,

1430
01:42:10,444 --> 01:42:14,062
and she'll tell us
all about the food rationing.

1431
01:42:14,198 --> 01:42:16,404
Then we go round to the boozer for a pint,

1432
01:42:16,534 --> 01:42:18,193
and old Charlie...

1433
01:42:18,327 --> 01:42:22,325
Oh, I wish I was back
with the bleeding battalion!

1434
01:42:23,999 --> 01:42:25,826
Parlez-vous

1435
01:42:25,959 --> 01:42:28,082
The Sergeant-Major's having a time

1436
01:42:28,211 --> 01:42:29,955
Parlez-vous

1437
01:42:30,089 --> 01:42:32,164
The Sergeant-Major's having a time

1438
01:42:32,299 --> 01:42:34,091
Swinging the lead behind the line

1439
01:42:34,218 --> 01:42:36,839
Inky-pinky parlez-vous

1440
01:42:37,847 --> 01:42:40,337
It's a hell of a song that we've just sung

1441
01:42:40,474 --> 01:42:42,098
Parlez-vous

1442
01:42:42,225 --> 01:42:44,384
It's a hell of a song that we've just sung

1443
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:46,228
Parlez-vous

1444
01:42:46,354 --> 01:42:48,394
It's a hell of a song that we've just sung

1445
01:42:48,523 --> 01:42:50,516
And the fellow that wrote it
ought to be hung

1446
01:42:50,651 --> 01:42:54,351
Inky-pinky parlez-vous

1447
01:43:03,789 --> 01:43:07,953
Oh, the moon shine bright
on Charlie Chaplin

1448
01:43:08,335 --> 01:43:10,458
His boots are cracking

1449
01:43:10,587 --> 01:43:13,079
For want of blacking

1450
01:43:13,507 --> 01:43:17,754
And his old baggy trousers want mending

1451
01:43:18,095 --> 01:43:21,962
Before they send him to the Dardanelles

1452
01:43:23,433 --> 01:43:27,597
Oh, the moon shines bright
on Charlie Chaplin

1453
01:43:27,729 --> 01:43:29,806
His boots are cracking

1454
01:43:29,940 --> 01:43:32,610
For want of blacking

1455
01:43:32,901 --> 01:43:37,113
And his old baggy trousers
they want mending

1456
01:43:37,239 --> 01:43:43,573
Before they send him to the Dardanelles

1457
01:45:59,715 --> 01:46:00,995
Parade!

1458
01:46:02,218 --> 01:46:03,498
Parade!

1459
01:46:04,094 --> 01:46:05,209
Halt!

1460
01:46:06,138 --> 01:46:08,095
Left turn!

1461
01:46:11,351 --> 01:46:13,759
Put down arms!

1462
01:46:16,023 --> 01:46:17,600
Stand at ease!

1463
01:46:17,942 --> 01:46:19,317
Stand easy!

1464
01:46:31,955 --> 01:46:33,118
Hey, Corp!

1465
01:46:34,041 --> 01:46:35,583
You reinforcements?

1466
01:46:35,709 --> 01:46:38,745
Yeah. We're on our way up to Wipers.

1467
01:46:39,254 --> 01:46:41,413
Wouldrt go up there if I were you.

1468
01:46:41,715 --> 01:46:43,589
They've got a shortage.

1469
01:46:43,801 --> 01:46:45,959
What of? Ammunition?

1470
01:46:46,971 --> 01:46:49,592
No. Coffins.

1471
01:47:07,366 --> 01:47:10,735
Parade, attention!

1472
01:47:44,653 --> 01:47:48,188
One staff officer jumped right over
another staff officer's back

1473
01:47:48,323 --> 01:47:52,404
And another staff officer jumped
right over that other staff officer's back

1474
01:47:52,536 --> 01:47:56,071
A third staff officer jumped right over
two other staff officers' backs

1475
01:47:56,206 --> 01:48:00,454
And a fourth staff officer jumped right
over all the other staff officers' backs

1476
01:48:00,586 --> 01:48:04,002
One staff officer jumped right over
another staff officer's back

1477
01:48:04,131 --> 01:48:08,129
And another staff officer jumped right
over that other staff officer's back

1478
01:48:08,260 --> 01:48:11,676
A third staff officer jumped right over
two other staff officers' backs

1479
01:48:11,805 --> 01:48:16,016
And a fourth staff officer jumped right
over the other staff officers' backs

1480
01:48:16,143 --> 01:48:19,927
They were only playing leapfrog

1481
01:48:20,063 --> 01:48:23,895
They were only playing leapfrog

1482
01:48:24,026 --> 01:48:27,560
They were only playing leapfrog

1483
01:48:27,696 --> 01:48:31,564
When one staff officer jumped right over
another staff officer's back

1484
01:48:31,784 --> 01:48:35,568
They were only playing leapfrog

1485
01:48:35,704 --> 01:48:39,405
They were only playing leapfrog

1486
01:48:39,625 --> 01:48:43,124
They were only playing leapfrog

1487
01:48:43,253 --> 01:48:46,871
When one staff officer jumped right over
another staff officer's back

1488
01:49:14,284 --> 01:49:18,117
When one staff officer jumped right over
another staff officer's back

1489
01:49:18,247 --> 01:49:20,120
Hello. GOC-in-C here.

1490
01:49:20,249 --> 01:49:21,791
Clear the line, please.

1491
01:49:21,917 --> 01:49:24,538
Has the 8th Division moved up on the right?

1492
01:49:24,962 --> 01:49:27,168
I see. Severe casualties.

1493
01:49:27,839 --> 01:49:31,422
No. You must reserve the artillery.
We're using too many shells.

1494
01:49:31,927 --> 01:49:34,085
Well, where is the 8th Division?

1495
01:49:34,221 --> 01:49:35,335
What?

1496
01:49:35,723 --> 01:49:38,296
I must have the 8th Division
forward on the right.

1497
01:49:38,433 --> 01:49:39,762
Thank you.

1498
01:49:40,227 --> 01:49:43,393
"70% casualties in the last attack.

1499
01:49:44,231 --> 01:49:48,727
"Then there is some corner of
a foreign field that is forever England."

1500
01:50:11,383 --> 01:50:15,796
Forward Joe Soap's army

1501
01:50:15,929 --> 01:50:20,141
Marching without fear

1502
01:50:20,433 --> 01:50:24,895
With our old commander

1503
01:50:25,022 --> 01:50:28,890
Safely in the rear

1504
01:50:29,026 --> 01:50:33,522
He boasts and skites from morn till night

1505
01:50:33,655 --> 01:50:37,950
And thinks he's very brave

1506
01:50:38,077 --> 01:50:42,573
But the men who really did the job

1507
01:50:42,706 --> 01:50:47,783
Are dead and in their grave

1508
01:50:48,128 --> 01:50:52,707
Forward Joe Soap's army

1509
01:50:52,841 --> 01:50:57,302
Marching without fear

1510
01:50:57,429 --> 01:51:02,637
With our old commander

1511
01:51:02,768 --> 01:51:08,557
Safely in the rear

1512
01:51:08,857 --> 01:51:13,649
Amen

1513
01:51:15,656 --> 01:51:17,862
Take up your places! Straight through!

1514
01:51:19,326 --> 01:51:21,284
Dearly beloved brethren.

1515
01:51:22,621 --> 01:51:26,073
I'm sure you will be glad to hear
the news from the home front.

1516
01:51:26,833 --> 01:51:29,954
The Archbishop of Canterbury
has made it known

1517
01:51:30,087 --> 01:51:34,215
that it is no sin
to labour for war on the Sabbath.

1518
01:51:35,092 --> 01:51:37,417
And I'm sure you would also like to know

1519
01:51:37,553 --> 01:51:41,171
that the Chief Rabbi has absolved
your Jewish brethren

1520
01:51:41,306 --> 01:51:44,510
from abstaining from pork in the trenches.

1521
01:51:45,853 --> 01:51:48,391
Likewise, his holiness the Pope has ruled

1522
01:51:48,522 --> 01:51:51,013
that the eating of flesh on Friday

1523
01:51:51,149 --> 01:51:53,475
is no longer a mortal sin.

1524
01:51:53,735 --> 01:51:57,187
- It's high time we had an Irish pope.
- You're right.

1525
01:51:57,447 --> 01:51:59,690
And in faraway Tibet,

1526
01:52:00,659 --> 01:52:04,657
the Dalai Lama has placed his prayers

1527
01:52:05,330 --> 01:52:07,572
at the disposal of the allies.

1528
01:52:08,834 --> 01:52:10,458
Now, brethren,

1529
01:52:10,836 --> 01:52:13,162
tomorrow being Good Friday,

1530
01:52:13,297 --> 01:52:16,582
we hope God will look kindly on our attack.

1531
01:52:19,053 --> 01:52:22,386
We will now sing from
Hymns Ancient and Modern.

1532
01:52:22,765 --> 01:52:24,722
Number 358.

1533
01:52:31,356 --> 01:52:36,398
The Church's one foundation

1534
01:52:36,528 --> 01:52:41,570
We are the ragtime infantry

1535
01:52:41,867 --> 01:52:44,358
We cannot fight

1536
01:52:44,495 --> 01:52:46,950
We cannot shoot

1537
01:52:47,080 --> 01:52:52,075
What bleeding use are we?

1538
01:52:52,377 --> 01:52:57,454
And when we get to Berlin

1539
01:52:57,633 --> 01:53:02,710
To be his holy bride

1540
01:53:02,846 --> 01:53:05,302
And from his lot

1541
01:53:05,432 --> 01:53:07,840
What a bloody rotten lot

1542
01:53:07,976 --> 01:53:14,097
Are the ragtime infantry

1543
01:53:14,483 --> 01:53:19,145
Amen

1544
01:53:20,698 --> 01:53:22,108
Let us pray.

1545
01:53:24,993 --> 01:53:28,113
O God, show thy face to us

1546
01:53:28,455 --> 01:53:31,410
as thou didst with thy angel at Mons.

1547
01:53:34,044 --> 01:53:37,958
The choir will now sing
What a Friend We Have in Jesus,

1548
01:53:38,173 --> 01:53:43,049
as we offer a silent prayer
for success in tomorrow's onslaught.

1549
01:53:43,262 --> 01:53:44,672
- Amen.
- Amen.

1550
01:53:53,271 --> 01:53:57,020
When this lousy war is over

1551
01:53:57,526 --> 01:54:01,738
What a friend we have in Jesus

1552
01:54:01,864 --> 01:54:05,114
No more soldiering for me

1553
01:54:05,242 --> 01:54:07,994
All our sins and griefs to bear

1554
01:54:08,162 --> 01:54:13,536
When I get my ciwy clothes on

1555
01:54:13,667 --> 01:54:15,577
What a privilege to carry

1556
01:54:15,711 --> 01:54:20,040
Oh, how happy I shall be

1557
01:54:20,174 --> 01:54:23,543
Everything to God in prayer

1558
01:54:23,677 --> 01:54:27,046
No more church parades on a Sunday

1559
01:54:27,181 --> 01:54:30,596
Oh, what peace we often forfeit

1560
01:54:30,725 --> 01:54:34,641
No more putting in for leave

1561
01:54:34,772 --> 01:54:38,141
Oh, what needless pain we bear

1562
01:54:38,275 --> 01:54:42,355
I shall kiss the Sergeant Major

1563
01:54:42,488 --> 01:54:45,939
All because we do not carry

1564
01:54:46,075 --> 01:54:48,992
- How I'll miss him
- All to God

1565
01:54:49,119 --> 01:54:52,535
- In prayer
- How he'll grieve

1566
01:54:55,292 --> 01:54:56,892
Amen

1567
01:55:05,010 --> 01:55:06,339
Well, God,

1568
01:55:06,929 --> 01:55:10,262
the prospects for a successful attack
are now ideal.

1569
01:55:11,308 --> 01:55:13,681
I place myself in your hands.

1570
01:55:14,353 --> 01:55:16,096
Land of our birth.

1571
01:55:16,229 --> 01:55:17,808
Land of our birth.

1572
01:55:17,940 --> 01:55:20,513
The fields are full of tents, O Lord,

1573
01:55:20,817 --> 01:55:22,276
all empty as yet

1574
01:55:22,402 --> 01:55:25,487
except for unmade and naked iron bedsteads.

1575
01:55:26,824 --> 01:55:29,908
Every ward has been cleared
to make way for the wounded

1576
01:55:30,036 --> 01:55:33,120
that will be arriving
when the big push comes.

1577
01:55:34,748 --> 01:55:37,417
The doctors say
there will be enormous numbers

1578
01:55:37,542 --> 01:55:39,749
of dead and wounded, God.

1579
01:55:40,963 --> 01:55:43,418
I ask thee for victory, Lord,

1580
01:55:44,091 --> 01:55:46,083
before the Americans arrive.

1581
01:55:46,218 --> 01:55:49,005
That we may bring, if need arise,

1582
01:55:49,180 --> 01:55:52,133
no maimed or won'thless sacrifice.

1583
01:55:54,893 --> 01:55:55,973
O Lord,

1584
01:55:56,103 --> 01:55:59,935
now lettest thou thy servant
depart in peace.

1585
01:56:00,065 --> 01:56:02,603
Parade, by squads!

1586
01:56:02,943 --> 01:56:04,402
Dismissed!

1587
01:56:04,528 --> 01:56:07,979
F squad, attention!

1588
01:56:08,115 --> 01:56:10,653
My troop, attention!

1589
01:56:14,830 --> 01:56:18,780
Whiter than the whitewash on the wall

1590
01:56:18,917 --> 01:56:22,666
Whiter than the whitewash on the wall

1591
01:56:22,796 --> 01:56:26,794
Oh, wash me in the water
that you wash your dirty daughter in

1592
01:56:26,925 --> 01:56:30,376
And I shall be whiter
than the whitewash on the wall

1593
01:56:30,513 --> 01:56:34,759
On the wall, on the wall

1594
01:56:34,891 --> 01:56:38,806
Oh, wash me in the water
that you wash your dirty daughter in

1595
01:56:38,937 --> 01:56:42,602
And I shall be whiter
than the whitewash on the wall

1596
01:56:43,108 --> 01:56:46,975
Quick march! Left, right, left, right!

1597
01:56:47,112 --> 01:56:50,481
Oh, wash me in the water
that you wash your dirty daughter in

1598
01:56:50,616 --> 01:56:54,614
And I shall be whiter
than the whitewash on the wall

1599
01:56:54,745 --> 01:56:58,789
On the wall, on the wall

1600
01:56:58,915 --> 01:57:02,581
On the wall, on the wall

1601
01:57:13,430 --> 01:57:15,257
O Lord, I beg you.

1602
01:57:15,390 --> 01:57:17,099
Do not let this dreadful war

1603
01:57:17,225 --> 01:57:20,096
cause all the suffering
that we have prepared for.

1604
01:57:21,772 --> 01:57:24,144
I know you will answer my prayer.

1605
01:57:37,120 --> 01:57:40,620
I want to go home

1606
01:57:41,417 --> 01:57:45,117
I want to go home

1607
01:57:45,546 --> 01:57:49,875
I don't want to go in the trenches no more

1608
01:57:50,092 --> 01:57:52,215
Where whizzbangs and shrapnel

1609
01:57:52,344 --> 01:57:54,751
They whistle and roar

1610
01:57:54,972 --> 01:57:58,471
Take me over the sea

1611
01:57:58,767 --> 01:58:03,014
Where the alleyman can't get at me

1612
01:58:04,064 --> 01:58:08,393
Oh my, I don't want to die

1613
01:58:08,527 --> 01:58:12,655
I want to go home

1614
01:58:13,073 --> 01:58:16,407
Take me over the sea

1615
01:58:16,869 --> 01:58:20,913
Where the alleyman can't get at me

1616
01:58:21,790 --> 01:58:26,453
Oh my, I don't want to die

1617
01:58:26,587 --> 01:58:32,257
I want to go home

1618
01:59:31,151 --> 01:59:32,811
I thank you, God.

1619
01:59:33,737 --> 01:59:35,979
The attack is a great success.

1620
01:59:36,740 --> 01:59:38,733
Fighting has been severe,

1621
01:59:39,076 --> 01:59:41,199
but that was to be expected.

1622
01:59:41,954 --> 01:59:45,120
There has been some delay
along the Menin Road,

1623
01:59:45,332 --> 01:59:48,084
but the ground is thick with enemy dead.

1624
01:59:49,086 --> 01:59:52,040
First reports from
the clearing stations state

1625
01:59:52,172 --> 01:59:55,755
that our casualties are only some 60,000,

1626
01:59:56,510 --> 01:59:58,004
mostly slight.

1627
01:59:58,554 --> 02:00:01,638
The wounded are very cheery indeed.

1628
02:00:08,563 --> 02:00:10,640
Well, that's the lot, then.

1629
02:00:11,859 --> 02:00:14,432
Right. Lead them off, Corporal Smith!

1630
02:00:16,238 --> 02:00:18,480
Right. Let's get back to the truck, lads.

1631
02:00:18,615 --> 02:00:20,324
Lead on this file.

1632
02:00:20,492 --> 02:00:21,690
Forward!

1633
02:00:21,827 --> 02:00:24,199
The bells of hell go ting-a-ling-a-ling

1634
02:00:24,329 --> 02:00:26,453
For you but not for me

1635
02:00:26,582 --> 02:00:29,369
And the little devils
how they sing-a-ling-a-ling

1636
02:00:29,501 --> 02:00:31,660
For you but not for me

1637
02:00:31,795 --> 02:00:34,547
Oh death
where is thy sting-a-ling-a-ling

1638
02:00:34,673 --> 02:00:36,832
Oh grave, thy victory?

1639
02:00:36,967 --> 02:00:39,719
The bells of hell go ting-a-ling-a-ling

1640
02:00:39,845 --> 02:00:42,680
For you but not for me

1641
02:00:43,557 --> 02:00:46,013
The bells of hell go ting-a-ling-a-ling

1642
02:00:46,143 --> 02:00:48,266
For you but not for me

1643
02:00:48,395 --> 02:00:51,064
And the little devils
how they sing-a-ling-a-ling

1644
02:00:51,190 --> 02:00:53,348
For you but not for me

1645
02:00:53,483 --> 02:00:56,057
Oh death
where is thy sting-a-ling-a-ling

1646
02:00:56,195 --> 02:00:58,271
Oh grave, thy victory?

1647
02:00:58,405 --> 02:01:01,157
The bells of hell go ting-a-ling-a-ling

1648
02:01:01,283 --> 02:01:03,821
For you but not for me

1649
02:01:09,624 --> 02:01:11,000
Thank you, sir.

1650
02:01:11,126 --> 02:01:12,668
Thank you, sir.

1651
02:01:13,587 --> 02:01:15,247
Sir, I've been wondering...

1652
02:01:15,380 --> 02:01:17,836
Or rather, the staff
and I have been wondering,

1653
02:01:17,966 --> 02:01:22,295
perhaps this policy of attrition
might be a mistake.

1654
02:01:22,596 --> 02:01:25,632
After all, it's wearing us down
more than it is them.

1655
02:01:26,016 --> 02:01:28,341
Couldrt we increase our efforts
on other fronts?

1656
02:01:28,477 --> 02:01:31,762
Nonsense. The Western Front
is the only real front.

1657
02:01:31,897 --> 02:01:33,854
We must grind them down.

1658
02:01:34,233 --> 02:01:38,064
You see,
our population is greater than theirs,

1659
02:01:38,195 --> 02:01:41,860
and their losses are greater than ours.

1660
02:01:42,199 --> 02:01:43,824
I don't quite follow that, sir.

1661
02:01:43,951 --> 02:01:45,326
In the end,

1662
02:01:45,452 --> 02:01:49,616
they will have 5,000 men left
and we shall have 10,000,

1663
02:01:49,748 --> 02:01:51,705
and we shall have won.

1664
02:01:53,460 --> 02:01:54,788
In any case,

1665
02:01:54,920 --> 02:01:57,921
I intend to launch
one more full-scale offensive.

1666
02:01:58,465 --> 02:02:02,130
And we shall break through and win.

1667
02:02:11,895 --> 02:02:13,270
Rum ration.

1668
02:02:22,865 --> 02:02:27,028
Old soldiers never die

1669
02:02:28,787 --> 02:02:31,658
The young ones wish they would

1670
02:02:33,292 --> 02:02:36,874
Those poor bastards still moaning
out in no-mars-land.

1671
02:02:38,380 --> 02:02:40,788
Somebody ought to do something about it.

1672
02:02:42,092 --> 02:02:44,464
It's terrible, terrible.

1673
02:02:45,012 --> 02:02:47,088
Sounds like a bleeding cattle market.

1674
02:02:47,222 --> 02:02:50,009
Right. Wakey-wakey. On your feet.

1675
02:02:50,141 --> 02:02:51,741
The order's come through for the attack.

1676
02:02:51,742 --> 02:02:53,184
We kick off at 5:00 ack-emma.

1677
02:02:53,311 --> 02:02:54,723
Right! Move!

1678
02:02:56,565 --> 02:02:58,771
That's a bloody fine time, isn't it?

1679
02:03:00,152 --> 02:03:04,861
If the sergeant steals your rum Never mind

1680
02:03:05,240 --> 02:03:10,033
If the sergeant steals your rum Never mind

1681
02:03:10,287 --> 02:03:13,074
Though he's just a bloody sod

1682
02:03:13,206 --> 02:03:16,042
Let him take the bleeding lot

1683
02:03:16,168 --> 02:03:20,629
If the sergeant steals your rum Never mind

1684
02:03:20,756 --> 02:03:23,922
Never mind

1685
02:03:24,885 --> 02:03:29,381
If old Jerry shells the trench Never mind

1686
02:03:29,640 --> 02:03:34,266
If old Jerry shells the trench Never mind

1687
02:03:34,478 --> 02:03:37,313
Though the blasted sandbags fly

1688
02:03:37,439 --> 02:03:40,357
You have only once to die

1689
02:03:40,484 --> 02:03:44,612
If old Jerry shells the trench Never mind

1690
02:03:44,738 --> 02:03:47,525
Never mind

1691
02:03:47,741 --> 02:03:49,319
Right. Come on, lads. Come on.

1692
02:03:49,452 --> 02:03:51,693
If you get stuck on the wire

1693
02:03:51,829 --> 02:03:54,783
- Never mind
- Never mind

1694
02:03:54,915 --> 02:03:57,537
If you get stuck on the wire

1695
02:03:57,668 --> 02:04:00,669
- Never mind
- Never mind

1696
02:04:00,796 --> 02:04:04,046
Though the light's as broad as day

1697
02:04:04,174 --> 02:04:07,839
When you die they stop your pay

1698
02:04:07,970 --> 02:04:11,421
If you get stuck on the wire

1699
02:04:11,557 --> 02:04:13,680
Never mind

1700
02:04:13,809 --> 02:04:19,313
Oh, never mind

1701
02:04:28,824 --> 02:04:35,491
Far far from Wipers, I long to be

1702
02:04:36,832 --> 02:04:43,120
Where German snipers can't get at me

1703
02:04:44,798 --> 02:04:51,762
Damp is my dugout, cold are my feet

1704
02:04:52,973 --> 02:05:00,055
Waiting for whizzbangs to send me to sleep

1705
02:05:05,444 --> 02:05:07,982
Sir! 5:00 ack-emma, sir.

1706
02:05:09,406 --> 02:05:11,613
- Press the attack immediately.
- Sir.

1707
02:05:17,747 --> 02:05:20,037
If you want the old battalion

1708
02:05:20,167 --> 02:05:22,206
We know where they are

1709
02:05:22,335 --> 02:05:24,127
We know where they are

1710
02:05:24,254 --> 02:05:26,128
We know where they are

1711
02:05:26,256 --> 02:05:28,498
If you want the old battalion

1712
02:05:28,634 --> 02:05:30,425
We know where they are

1713
02:05:30,553 --> 02:05:34,170
They're hanging on the old barbed wire

1714
02:05:34,389 --> 02:05:38,683
We've seen them, we've seen them

1715
02:05:39,227 --> 02:05:42,679
Hanging on the old barbed wire

1716
02:05:42,814 --> 02:05:47,192
We've seen them, we've seen them

1717
02:05:47,402 --> 02:05:50,902
Hanging on the old barbed wire

1718
02:05:51,031 --> 02:05:55,492
We've seen them, we've seen them

1719
02:05:55,869 --> 02:05:59,285
Hanging on the old barbed wire

1720
02:05:59,414 --> 02:06:03,744
We've seen them, we've seen them

1721
02:06:04,044 --> 02:06:06,962
Hanging on the old barbed wire

1722
02:06:07,089 --> 02:06:11,667
We've seen them
Hanging on the old barbed wire

1723
02:06:40,664 --> 02:06:42,206
Right! Over the top, boys!

1724
02:06:42,332 --> 02:06:44,906
Come on, now, fast as you can!
Come on, lads.

1725
02:07:01,685 --> 02:07:05,683
'Our counteroffensive
commenced this morning.

1726
02:07:05,814 --> 02:07:08,519
'Satisfactory progress.

1727
02:07:09,693 --> 02:07:12,943
'Yesterday, the King inspected the troops.

1728
02:07:13,447 --> 02:07:14,775
'Trouble was

1729
02:07:14,907 --> 02:07:18,489
'that the men waved
their hats instead of flags

1730
02:07:18,619 --> 02:07:20,576
'as His Majesty rode by.

1731
02:07:21,204 --> 02:07:24,122
'The King did clutch
the reins too firmly... '

1732
02:07:24,374 --> 02:07:25,785
Correction.

1733
02:07:26,043 --> 02:07:30,870
The King did clutch
the reins rather firmly,

1734
02:07:31,340 --> 02:07:33,913
no reflection on
His Majesty's horsemanship.

1735
02:07:34,051 --> 02:07:37,384
The grass was very slippery,
and the mare moved backwards.

1736
02:07:37,971 --> 02:07:41,969
I'd exercised her every day for a year.

1737
02:07:42,851 --> 02:07:46,683
So unfortunate it had to be my horse
that threw the King.

1738
02:07:52,861 --> 02:07:55,186
They've all gone.
They've all been killed.

1739
02:07:55,322 --> 02:07:57,944
No, they haven't.
They're just under cover.

1740
02:07:58,867 --> 02:08:00,824
- Where are you going?
- Forward.

1741
02:08:00,953 --> 02:08:03,526
It's no use staying here.
You've got to keep moving forward.

1742
02:08:03,663 --> 02:08:06,534
Look, as soon as the next
shell bursts in front of us,

1743
02:08:06,666 --> 02:08:09,240
- you follow me into the hole. Right?
- Right.

1744
02:08:20,764 --> 02:08:23,516
Why don't our gunners do something
about that bleeding machine gun?

1745
02:08:23,642 --> 02:08:24,840
They are doing something.

1746
02:08:27,312 --> 02:08:28,688
They just haven't hit him yet.

1747
02:08:28,814 --> 02:08:30,972
Let's have a try with one of these.

1748
02:08:41,410 --> 02:08:45,324
I'd like to catch that bleeder
who threw that bleeding smoke bomb.

1749
02:08:45,455 --> 02:08:47,495
I can't see a bleeding thing.

1750
02:08:47,624 --> 02:08:50,625
Far far from Wipers, I long to be

1751
02:08:50,877 --> 02:08:55,089
Where German snipers can't get at me

1752
02:08:55,340 --> 02:08:57,250
This is the life, eh, Sarge?

1753
02:08:58,594 --> 02:09:02,093
Damp is my dugout, cold are my feet

1754
02:09:02,223 --> 02:09:06,635
Waiting for whizzbangs to send me to sleep

1755
02:09:06,977 --> 02:09:08,768
I must have drawn you in a sweep.

1756
02:09:13,400 --> 02:09:15,974
- I've had enough of this.
- Yeah, me and all.

1757
02:09:16,111 --> 02:09:18,020
Let's get that bleeding machine gun.

1758
02:09:18,155 --> 02:09:21,109
- They're just as scared as we are.
- All right.

1759
02:09:21,241 --> 02:09:22,700
Where do you reckon you're going?

1760
02:09:22,826 --> 02:09:25,115
Just to have a crack at that gun, Sarge.

1761
02:09:25,245 --> 02:09:27,203
All right. Careful, now.

1762
02:09:27,331 --> 02:09:29,537
- I'll give you covering fire.
- Right.

1763
02:09:29,666 --> 02:09:33,498
- See you after the war, Sarge.
- Yeah, at your sister-in-law Flo's place.

1764
02:09:33,628 --> 02:09:35,502
- About 8:00.
- Make it half-past.

1765
02:09:35,631 --> 02:09:37,588
- What?
- I might be a bit late!

1766
02:09:53,399 --> 02:09:54,561
Right.

1767
02:09:55,401 --> 02:09:56,645
Right.

1768
02:09:57,736 --> 02:10:00,108
You can close the battle of the Somme now.

1769
02:10:00,238 --> 02:10:06,111
The final British losses
are 607,784 officers and men.

1770
02:10:06,328 --> 02:10:09,495
- And the French losses, sir?
- They are still to come.

1771
02:10:09,623 --> 02:10:12,031
And ground gained, nil.

1772
02:10:17,589 --> 02:10:20,163
'Thank you for the copy of The Times.

1773
02:10:21,635 --> 02:10:25,004
'I'm glad that in spite of all,
it is still a victory.

1774
02:10:26,932 --> 02:10:29,055
'lt does not seem so here.

1775
02:10:31,561 --> 02:10:34,231
'lt is beyond belief, the butchery.

1776
02:10:35,440 --> 02:10:38,607
'The men look so appalling
when they are brought in,

1777
02:10:39,444 --> 02:10:41,437
'and so many die.'

1778
02:10:56,044 --> 02:10:58,998
They were summoned from the hillside

1779
02:10:59,381 --> 02:11:01,623
They were called in from the glen

1780
02:11:01,842 --> 02:11:04,415
And the country found them ready

1781
02:11:04,553 --> 02:11:07,673
At the stirring call for men

1782
02:11:08,557 --> 02:11:11,344
Let no tears add to their hardship

1783
02:11:11,602 --> 02:11:14,307
As the soldiers pass along

1784
02:11:15,313 --> 02:11:19,560
And although your heart is breaking

1785
02:11:19,693 --> 02:11:26,407
Make it sing this cheery song

1786
02:11:27,993 --> 02:11:33,498
Keep the home fires burning

1787
02:11:33,623 --> 02:11:38,582
While your hearts are yearning

1788
02:11:39,255 --> 02:11:44,130
Though the lads are far away

1789
02:11:44,259 --> 02:11:49,680
They dream of home

1790
02:11:51,016 --> 02:11:56,473
There's a silver lining

1791
02:11:56,605 --> 02:12:02,061
Through the dark clouds shining

1792
02:12:02,695 --> 02:12:08,400
Turn the dark cloud inside out

1793
02:12:08,534 --> 02:12:15,533
Till the boys come home

1794
02:12:26,510 --> 02:12:28,337
Come along, Harry, lad.

1795
02:12:28,971 --> 02:12:31,260
Have to move you onto the ground now.

1796
02:12:37,437 --> 02:12:39,181
Need the stretcher, see?

1797
02:13:09,762 --> 02:13:11,256
There's a casualty list up.

1798
02:13:11,722 --> 02:13:13,347
I wonder who's on it.

1799
02:13:14,808 --> 02:13:16,433
Excuse me, love.

1800
02:13:17,936 --> 02:13:19,810
Hey, there's another Arkwright again.

1801
02:13:19,938 --> 02:13:21,765
Oh, I never did.

1802
02:13:21,899 --> 02:13:24,021
Hey, Milly, another Arkwright gone.

1803
02:13:24,151 --> 02:13:25,396
Yeah. I know her.

1804
02:13:25,527 --> 02:13:27,271
- That's three she's lost.
- No, four.

1805
02:13:27,404 --> 02:13:28,732
No, three.

1806
02:13:28,864 --> 02:13:31,236
They're bringing them back at night now.

1807
02:13:31,784 --> 02:13:33,029
What is it?

1808
02:13:33,160 --> 02:13:35,402
It's just another list, Flo.

1809
02:13:35,537 --> 02:13:38,289
- Ethel's boy's just been let out of prison.
- Why?

1810
02:13:38,415 --> 02:13:41,582
- There's another big push coming.
- Oh, never.

1811
02:13:41,710 --> 02:13:44,795
Ask Flo. She's in munitions.
They're always first to know.

1812
02:13:44,921 --> 02:13:46,830
Is that true, then?

1813
02:13:49,843 --> 02:13:51,717
It's true. It's starting again.

1814
02:13:51,845 --> 02:13:54,087
Don't worry, love,
your Jack will be all right.

1815
02:13:54,223 --> 02:13:57,058
- Can't go on much longer now, can it?
- Of course not.

1816
02:13:57,184 --> 02:13:59,177
Must be rotten for you working down there.

1817
02:13:59,311 --> 02:14:02,644
- It's not bad.
- I wouldn't like it, all those men.

1818
02:14:02,773 --> 02:14:04,682
Our old foremars bad enough.

1819
02:14:06,235 --> 02:14:08,939
One girl earned £3 last week with overtime.

1820
02:14:09,071 --> 02:14:10,529
- Go on.
- It's true.

1821
02:14:10,656 --> 02:14:11,936
They're paying a fortune.

1822
02:14:12,074 --> 02:14:14,647
They need to,
after that explosion last week.

1823
02:14:14,785 --> 02:14:16,445
Never found nothing of them, did they?

1824
02:14:16,579 --> 02:14:18,156
We're going on overtime next week.

1825
02:14:18,288 --> 02:14:19,747
What you making?

1826
02:14:19,873 --> 02:14:21,284
Big new order's coming.

1827
02:14:21,416 --> 02:14:23,456
It's funny stuff, they say it's for shrouds.

1828
02:14:23,585 --> 02:14:25,958
- Oh, it makes you shiver.
- Milly.

1829
02:14:26,213 --> 02:14:27,328
What's that?

1830
02:14:31,927 --> 02:14:33,421
It's the Yankees!

1831
02:14:34,263 --> 02:14:35,888
Come on.

1832
02:15:07,796 --> 02:15:08,995
Over there

1833
02:15:09,131 --> 02:15:10,459
Over there.

1834
02:15:10,591 --> 02:15:12,916
- Our infantry...
- Have the reserves been...

1835
02:15:14,845 --> 02:15:18,178
The Yanks are coming The Yanks are coming

1836
02:15:18,307 --> 02:15:21,427
The drums rum-tumming everywhere

1837
02:15:21,560 --> 02:15:25,011
So prepare, say a prayer

1838
02:15:25,147 --> 02:15:28,183
Send the word, send the word to beware

1839
02:15:28,317 --> 02:15:31,650
We'll be over, we're coming over

1840
02:15:31,779 --> 02:15:35,823
And we won't come back
We'll be buried over there

1841
02:15:46,668 --> 02:15:48,293
Hello, Ben.

1842
02:15:49,004 --> 02:15:52,207
- Who's that, then?
- Smithey. Jack Smith.

1843
02:15:52,341 --> 02:15:53,621
Hello, Jack.

1844
02:15:54,343 --> 02:15:56,668
- One of Jerry's, eh?
- Yeah.

1845
02:15:56,804 --> 02:15:59,010
Must have thought they were staying.

1846
02:16:00,015 --> 02:16:01,615
- How are you, mate? All right?
- Fine.

1847
02:16:01,683 --> 02:16:03,308
Good to see you.

1848
02:16:06,438 --> 02:16:10,270
- What's it like outside?
- They're still strafing.

1849
02:16:10,818 --> 02:16:12,775
I'm bloody sick of it.

1850
02:16:13,737 --> 02:16:15,445
Do you know where we are?

1851
02:16:18,033 --> 02:16:19,196
Mons.

1852
02:16:19,868 --> 02:16:21,991
First big battle of the war.

1853
02:16:22,162 --> 02:16:24,202
We're right back where we started.

1854
02:16:24,331 --> 02:16:27,248
Look at that.
Wouldrt catch me eating it.

1855
02:16:28,460 --> 02:16:31,247
My brother Harry, he was at Mons.

1856
02:16:31,838 --> 02:16:34,126
They're bloody starving in Germany,
you know?

1857
02:16:34,383 --> 02:16:35,842
We both were.

1858
02:16:37,177 --> 02:16:39,549
I heard the Germans is going Bolshevik.

1859
02:16:39,930 --> 02:16:42,931
That's when he got wounded. First time.

1860
02:16:43,600 --> 02:16:45,225
They say the German Navy's mutinied.

1861
02:16:45,352 --> 02:16:47,992
There's going to be a revolution.
They're just like the Russians.

1862
02:16:47,993 --> 02:16:49,682
Right, on your feet. Outside, you lot!

1863
02:16:49,815 --> 02:16:51,772
Then he came back again.

1864
02:16:53,026 --> 02:16:56,062
Corporal Tanner,
he's read this bloke Lenin.

1865
02:16:56,197 --> 02:16:58,154
He reckons it's all going to be different.

1866
02:16:58,283 --> 02:17:00,489
Well, it's got to be, isn't it?

1867
02:17:00,618 --> 02:17:02,410
It stands to reason.

1868
02:17:07,127 --> 02:17:09,663
They say the war will end anytime now.

1869
02:17:09,797 --> 02:17:12,667
Get your mask on,
or you won't live to see it.

1870
02:18:17,820 --> 02:18:18,934
Halt!

1871
02:18:26,537 --> 02:18:27,818
Right. Come on.

1872
02:18:40,011 --> 02:18:41,971
Who the hell are you, then,
the unknown soldier?

1873
02:18:41,972 --> 02:18:44,676
No, sir, I'm 294, Smith, J.

1874
02:18:44,808 --> 02:18:47,097
You'll have to move some. It's 10:58.

1875
02:18:47,266 --> 02:18:48,514
You're the last one.

1876
02:18:48,642 --> 02:18:52,058
Come on, lad, just follow the tape.

1877
02:22:14,058 --> 02:22:15,257
Granny.

1878
02:22:17,100 --> 02:22:19,677
Granny, what did Daddy do in the war?

1879
02:22:22,773 --> 02:22:26,902
And when they ask us

1880
02:22:27,570 --> 02:22:31,983
How dangerous it was

1881
02:22:32,533 --> 02:22:36,662
Oh, we'll never tell them

1882
02:22:37,501 --> 02:22:41,877
No, we'll never tell them

1883
02:22:42,507 --> 02:22:46,753
We spent our pay in some café

1884
02:22:47,092 --> 02:22:52,217
And fought wild women night and day

1885
02:22:52,933 --> 02:23:00,016
'Twas the cushiest job we ever had

1886
02:23:01,273 --> 02:23:05,683
And when they ask us

1887
02:23:05,858 --> 02:23:10,570
And they're certainly going to ask us

1888
02:23:10,700 --> 02:23:15,527
The reason why we didn't win

1889
02:23:15,662 --> 02:23:20,126
The Croix de Guerre

1890
02:23:20,253 --> 02:23:25,044
Oh, we'll never tell them

1891
02:23:25,175 --> 02:23:29,750
No, we'll never tell them

1892
02:23:30,262 --> 02:23:32,798
There was a front

1893
02:23:32,932 --> 02:23:40,014
But damned if we knew where

1894
02:23:45,816 --> 02:23:50,444
And they're certainly going to ask us

1895
02:23:50,572 --> 02:23:55,613
The reason why we didn't win

1896
02:23:55,744 --> 02:24:00,406
The Croix de Guerre

1897
02:24:00,542 --> 02:24:05,451
Oh, we'll never tell them

1898
02:24:05,588 --> 02:24:10,463
No, we'll never tell them

1899
02:24:11,054 --> 02:24:14,054
There was a front

1900
02:24:14,224 --> 02:24:21,306
But damned if we knew where
