subtitle by Adam and GZ

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,730
In a hole in the ground
there lived a  hobbit.

3
00:00:16,648 --> 00:00:20,985
Many ages ago, when this ancient
planet was not quite so ancient...

4
00:00:21,193 --> 00:00:24,071
... long before men
recorded his history...

5
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:28,616
... here was the time of Middle Earth,
where men shared his days with...

6
00:00:28,825 --> 00:00:33,662
... elves, dwarves, wizards,
goblins, dragons and... hobbits.

7
00:00:34,413 --> 00:00:38,416
In the lands of Middle Earth,
in an area known as the Shire...

8
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:41,043
... It was a village named
Hobbiton.

9
00:00:41,252 --> 00:00:45,088
There, in a hole in the ground
there lived a hobbit.

10
00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:48,007
Not a  nasty, dirty, wet hole,

11
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:51,093
nor a dry, bare, sandy  hole.

12
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,806
It was a hobbit-hole,
and that means comfort.

13
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,321
Bilbo Baggins?
Yes?

14
00:01:16,114 --> 00:01:19,242
- I'm looking to hire a burglar.
- Burglar?

15
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,577
I'm afraid you've come
to the wrong place.

16
00:01:21,786 --> 00:01:26,039
You mean you do not wish
to share a grand adventure?

17
00:01:26,248 --> 00:01:29,667
Dear, me? No!
We hobbits are plain quiet folk.

18
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:32,336
Adventures make one late for dinner.

19
00:01:34,296 --> 00:01:37,173
Enough! I'm Gandalf.

20
00:01:37,382 --> 00:01:41,052
And Gandalf means me!

21
00:01:42,678 --> 00:01:47,807
- Gandalf? Not the wondering wizard?
- The same!

22
00:01:48,558 --> 00:01:49,559
Listen.

23
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:11,619
Thorin and company, at your service.

24
00:02:12,286 --> 00:02:14,079
Dwalin, Balin...

25
00:02:14,288 --> 00:02:15,956
...Kili, Fili...

26
00:02:16,164 --> 00:02:19,334
...Dori, Nori and Ori.

27
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:22,461
Oin, sir. And Gloin, sir.

28
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,339
Calling Bifur. And him, Bofur.

29
00:02:25,547 --> 00:02:29,842
And Bombur at your service.

30
00:02:30,051 --> 00:02:33,762
We are all at your service.

31
00:02:54,071 --> 00:02:57,073
What do these dwarves
want in Hobbiton?

32
00:02:57,324 --> 00:03:00,034
They've come for tea, and for supper...

33
00:03:00,243 --> 00:03:03,662
... and for you, Burgler Baggins!

34
00:03:22,845 --> 00:03:27,307
- There's a magic in that music.
- And it moves through me.

35
00:03:27,515 --> 00:03:32,770
- You feel the love of beautiful things.
- To go and see the great mountains...

36
00:03:32,978 --> 00:03:35,772
... and hear the pine-trees and waterfalls.

37
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:38,733
To wear a sword instead of a walking-stick.

38
00:03:38,942 --> 00:03:40,318
Just once.

39
00:03:43,237 --> 00:03:46,615
Gandalf, dwarves and Burgler Baggins...

40
00:03:46,823 --> 00:03:48,992
What is this burgler business?

41
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,620
If you prefer, you can say
"expert treasure-hunter".

42
00:03:52,828 --> 00:03:55,956
Well, yes, I do prefer that.

43
00:03:56,164 --> 00:03:59,334
We have met tonight,
in the house of our friend...

44
00:03:59,542 --> 00:04:01,836
... this most excellent hobbit.

45
00:04:02,044 --> 00:04:05,922
May the hair on his toes never fall out!

46
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:07,465
Cheer-cheer!

47
00:04:07,757 --> 00:04:10,301
We shall soon start on our long journey,

48
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,679
Our object is, I take it,
well known to us.

49
00:04:13,846 --> 00:04:14,930
All of us?

50
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:18,057
It is not well known to me.

51
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:22,937
Really? Then we must inform our burgler.

52
00:04:24,062 --> 00:04:26,398
We seek a treasure...

53
00:04:26,606 --> 00:04:29,817
... that which is rightfully ours.

54
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:32,153
Far off in the East...

55
00:04:32,361 --> 00:04:36,281
... beyond the Misty Mountains
and the dark forest of Mirkwood...

56
00:04:36,489 --> 00:04:40,993
... there you will find Lonely Mountain.

57
00:04:45,706 --> 00:04:49,083
Long ago, this was the home of my people...

58
00:04:49,292 --> 00:04:51,877
... and was ruled by my grandfather:

59
00:04:52,086 --> 00:04:55,213
King under the Mountain.

60
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:03,220
The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,

61
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:05,972
While hammers fell like ringing bells

62
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:09,142
In places deep, where dark things sleep,

63
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,770
In hollow halls beneath the fells.

64
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,649
Goblets they carved there for themselves

65
00:05:17,857 --> 00:05:20,776
And harps of gold; where no man delves

66
00:05:20,985 --> 00:05:23,404
There lay they long, and many a song

67
00:05:23,612 --> 00:05:27,657
Was sung unheard by men or elves.

68
00:05:29,617 --> 00:05:32,119
For ancient king and elvish lord

69
00:05:32,328 --> 00:05:34,955
There many a gloaming golden hoard

70
00:05:35,163 --> 00:05:37,916
They shaped and wrought, and light they caught

71
00:05:38,082 --> 00:05:41,377
To hide in gems on hilt of sword.

72
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:45,464
On silver necklaces they strung

73
00:05:45,672 --> 00:05:48,841
The flowering stars, on crowns they hung

74
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,552
The dragon-fire, in twisted wire

75
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:55,305
They meshed the light of moon and sun.

76
00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:02,103
Undoubtedly all this wealth was
what brought the dragon.

77
00:06:05,605 --> 00:06:10,026
The pines were roaring on the height,
The winds were moaning in the night.

78
00:06:10,234 --> 00:06:13,362
The fire was red, it flaming spread;

79
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,907
The trees like torches biased with light,

80
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:22,203
And below us, in the valley lay Dale...

81
00:06:22,411 --> 00:06:24,955
... the town of mortal men.

82
00:06:27,415 --> 00:06:32,503
The bells were ringing in the dale
And men looked up with faces pale;

83
00:06:32,711 --> 00:06:35,881
The dragon's ire more fierce than fire

84
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:39,550
Laid low their towers and houses frail.

85
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,178
The mountain smoked beneath the moon;

86
00:06:42,386 --> 00:06:45,347
The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom.

87
00:06:45,555 --> 00:06:48,516
They fled their hall to dying -fall

88
00:06:48,725 --> 00:06:51,852
Beneath his feet, beneath the moon.

89
00:07:06,823 --> 00:07:09,909
Curses to the dragon!
Curses to Smaug!

90
00:07:10,118 --> 00:07:12,995
He killed our men and stole our gold!

91
00:07:13,162 --> 00:07:15,872
Curses to the dragon Smaug!

92
00:07:16,081 --> 00:07:19,000
Is this the adventure you've planned for me?

93
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:21,502
To help you recapture the gold?

94
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:22,836
Non other.

95
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:28,341
There are thirteen of you. Very unlucky.

96
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:31,552
Mr. Baggins will make it fourteen.

97
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:34,680
A splendid lucky number you've found for us.

98
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:38,474
No arguments. Let us have the contract.

99
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:44,271
"To Burgler Baggins. Terms for your
professional services.

100
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,691
One fourteenth of total profits,
travelling expenses guarenteed.

101
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,695
Funeral expenses if necessary.
Sincerely, Thorin and company."

102
00:07:53,946 --> 00:07:57,949
- Funeral expenses?
- Do you find the terms acceptable?

103
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:01,285
- Of course he does!
- But, but I...

104
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:06,831
So, tomorrow begins your greatest adventure.

105
00:08:40,818 --> 00:08:47,574
The Hobbit

106
00:10:28,825 --> 00:10:31,702
No hat, no stick, no pipe.

107
00:10:31,911 --> 00:10:36,498
Not even a pocket-handkerchief.
How can one survive?

108
00:10:40,751 --> 00:10:44,922
- How did Gandalf get ahead of us, Bombur?
- He comes and goes with will.

109
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,298
He is a wizard, you know.

110
00:10:51,677 --> 00:10:54,930
Oh, bother burgling and
everything to do with it.

111
00:10:56,097 --> 00:10:59,767
Always remember, Bilbo,
when your heart wants lifting...

112
00:10:59,976 --> 00:11:02,353
... think of pleasant things.

113
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:06,022
Eggs and bacon, a good full pipe,

114
00:11:06,231 --> 00:11:10,526
My garden at twilight. Cakes...

115
00:11:13,862 --> 00:11:19,158
We'll camp here. Perhaps we can find
a dry patch to sleep on.

116
00:11:23,203 --> 00:11:26,123
Our lookout has found something.

117
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,625
Look. Trolls!

118
00:11:33,504 --> 00:11:36,131
Miserable, no good robbing trolls.

119
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:38,258
Where the deuce is Gandalf?

120
00:11:38,466 --> 00:11:43,512
Left us again. Just when a wizard
would have been most useful.

121
00:11:43,721 --> 00:11:46,765
No matter. We have
an expert burgler with us.

122
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:51,727
- What have trolls to do with burgling?
- You could use some of that meat they're cooking.

123
00:11:51,936 --> 00:11:56,731
- Oh, I say!
- Burgler, do your burgling!

124
00:11:57,524 --> 00:12:02,611
Blasted!
Nothing but mutton to eat!

125
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,113
How I...

126
00:12:05,322 --> 00:12:09,033
... look for a bit of bad flesh!

127
00:12:09,992 --> 00:12:13,245
Bacon and eggs. My fireplace. Hot chestnuts.

128
00:12:16,748 --> 00:12:21,168
- What the blazes?
- Help! Help! Let me down! Stop that! Stop that!

129
00:12:21,377 --> 00:12:23,670
What have we got here?

130
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:27,882
Let's cook him and find out!

131
00:12:29,717 --> 00:12:32,720
He wouldn't make a mouthful.

132
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:39,183
But maybe there's more where he came from.

133
00:12:39,434 --> 00:12:42,561
Dwarves! I'm done for. Done for it!

134
00:12:45,272 --> 00:12:47,399
Dwarves?

135
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:50,193
That's our supper!

136
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:53,278
Let's go get 'em all!

137
00:13:03,954 --> 00:13:07,123
Let's roast them.

138
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,044
No, boil them, says I!

139
00:13:12,836 --> 00:13:15,797
It's to his own, boys!

140
00:13:15,964 --> 00:13:18,758
There's plenty for all.

141
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:23,095
I likes mine roast.

142
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:35,731
Dawn take you all, and be stone to you!

143
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,818
The sun!

144
00:13:41,027 --> 00:13:43,028
Blessed it!

145
00:13:43,237 --> 00:13:48,533
How did the morning come so soon?

146
00:13:49,283 --> 00:13:51,744
We're done for!

147
00:13:56,123 --> 00:13:57,165
Excellent.

148
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:02,753
One moment.
One moment!

149
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:08,174
Where's that bumbling burgler?
Lucky number, indeed!

150
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,301
Over here!

151
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,511
Come and see what I've found!

152
00:14:14,012 --> 00:14:16,848
Not bad, burgler,
for your first attempt.

153
00:14:17,265 --> 00:14:19,350
Oh, it was nothing, actually.

154
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,980
We'll keep these.
Deucedly fine blades.

155
00:14:25,188 --> 00:14:27,690
Considering they
were made by trolls.

156
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,610
They don't seem like
troll blades to me.

157
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:33,779
Probably stolen.

158
00:14:34,238 --> 00:14:38,950
- See these strange runes?
- Whatever are runes?

159
00:14:39,158 --> 00:14:43,787
Ancient writing. Mine has
them too. Can you make them out?

160
00:14:44,621 --> 00:14:47,415
I'm not familiar with these letters.

161
00:14:47,624 --> 00:14:51,377
Well, whoever made them,
we've got them now!

162
00:14:51,585 --> 00:14:55,297
Cover up the treasure, men.
We'll fetch it on our return.

163
00:14:58,049 --> 00:15:01,385
Take that, Smaug, you filthy worm!

164
00:15:01,594 --> 00:15:04,513
I see you've also claimed a sword.

165
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:08,057
Yes. Just a dagger, actually.

166
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:12,061
But for one of my size, it suffices.

167
00:15:25,572 --> 00:15:28,116
Hurry men, we must be on our way!

168
00:15:28,324 --> 00:15:30,451
- Hold!
- Hold?

169
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,370
It is time for you to have this.

170
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:35,914
And what may that be?

171
00:15:36,915 --> 00:15:39,459
This is a map of Lonely Mountain...

172
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:43,712
Presented to me one hundred
years ago by your father.

173
00:15:43,921 --> 00:15:47,632
What? Why did you not come
to me? The rightful heir?

174
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:50,885
I've chosen my own time to hand it over.

175
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:55,430
Oh, I do love maps.
I have quite a collection.

176
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:59,392
Ah, I remember the Mountain
whether not without this!

177
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,563
Indeed? And how do you intend
to enter Smaug's chambers?

178
00:16:04,771 --> 00:16:08,024
Through the main gate?
As a house guest?

179
00:16:08,274 --> 00:16:11,485
You'd be ash before
you took your seventh step.

180
00:16:11,694 --> 00:16:13,112
Oh, see, look!

181
00:16:13,946 --> 00:16:18,950
This hand points from these runes to...

182
00:16:19,158 --> 00:16:22,703
Bless my soul!
A secret entrance!

183
00:16:23,495 --> 00:16:27,999
- A hidden passage to the Lower Halls!
- Excellent, burgler!

184
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:32,002
- I'm really quite good with maps.
- Let me see.

185
00:16:32,795 --> 00:16:35,297
Yes, quite correct.

186
00:16:35,505 --> 00:16:38,967
But, has it remained
a secret all these years?

187
00:16:39,175 --> 00:16:42,344
It's too small for Smaug to use.

188
00:16:42,553 --> 00:16:47,849
And it's covered by a door made looking
exactly like the side of the mountain.

189
00:16:48,725 --> 00:16:52,853
Here is the key. Keep it safe.

190
00:16:53,562 --> 00:16:55,022
But of course I will!

191
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:58,942
But... if the secret door
is hidden, how do we find it?

192
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:02,778
- The map doesn't tell.
- It does and it doesn't.

193
00:17:04,488 --> 00:17:08,283
You will understand in time.

194
00:17:28,174 --> 00:17:31,761
Behold, at last. Rivendell!

195
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:36,765
The hidden valley of the elves,
where Elrond dwelles.

196
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,350
Simply enchanting!

197
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,603
- But we must be on.
- Pity.

198
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,731
Elvish singing is not a thing to miss...

199
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:50,484
... in June under
the stars. But...

200
00:18:15,714 --> 00:18:19,884
My dear Elrond,
your hospitality is magnificent.

201
00:18:20,051 --> 00:18:23,387
The food, the vine,
the stories, the music.

202
00:18:23,637 --> 00:18:26,139
Yes, but we've
much to accomplish.

203
00:18:26,348 --> 00:18:29,892
You promised to have a look
at these troll swords after all feast.

204
00:18:30,101 --> 00:18:32,061
Yes, yes, of course.

205
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:36,064
The first of all,
they're not troll-make.

206
00:18:36,273 --> 00:18:38,149
They must have been stolen.

207
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:43,862
They were made for the goblin-wars.
This sword, Thorin, the runes name

208
00:18:44,071 --> 00:18:47,282
Orcrist, the Goblin-cleaver.

209
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:52,369
- And mine?
- Glamdring, the Foe-hammer.

210
00:18:52,745 --> 00:18:56,456
- Keep them well.
- I will keep this in honour.

211
00:18:56,665 --> 00:19:00,084
- Now show me your map.
- I have it here.

212
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,757
Something's strange. Let's see.

213
00:19:09,425 --> 00:19:11,260
Yes, indeed!

214
00:19:12,094 --> 00:19:15,889
There are moon-letters here! See?

215
00:19:16,097 --> 00:19:18,224
What are moon-letters?

216
00:19:18,433 --> 00:19:23,645
Runes that can only be seen
when the moon shines behind them.

217
00:19:23,854 --> 00:19:28,775
They give directions
for finding the secret door.

218
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:34,696
"Stand by the grey stone
when the thrush knocks,

219
00:19:34,905 --> 00:19:37,615
... and the last light
of the setting sun...

220
00:19:37,907 --> 00:19:41,786
... will shine upon the keyhole."

221
00:19:51,794 --> 00:19:53,295
This way!

222
00:19:53,504 --> 00:19:57,215
Shelter!
A dry cave!

223
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:08,766
Now, get some sleep, men.
We found a perfect place to camp.

224
00:20:25,155 --> 00:20:28,992
Dwarves have a strange
notion of perfection.

225
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,035
And where's Gandalf?

226
00:20:31,243 --> 00:20:34,705
Gone again?
I wish I was a wizard!

227
00:20:37,457 --> 00:20:39,667
Hello! What's this?

228
00:20:43,837 --> 00:20:45,672
Look out!

229
00:20:48,424 --> 00:20:50,343
The ponies! The ponies!

230
00:20:53,846 --> 00:20:56,014
Wake up! We've been robbed!

231
00:20:59,017 --> 00:21:00,977
The goblins are upon us!

232
00:21:01,185 --> 00:21:03,812
Save the ponies from the goblins!

233
00:21:13,946 --> 00:21:16,990
Trapped!
The goblins have us!

234
00:21:57,982 --> 00:22:01,986
Who are these miserable persons?

235
00:22:02,194 --> 00:22:05,781
Thorin, at your service.
We did not mean to trespass.

236
00:22:05,989 --> 00:22:09,033
We were merely seeking
shelter from the storm.

237
00:22:09,242 --> 00:22:12,578
He is a liar, oh,
truly tremendous one.

238
00:22:12,745 --> 00:22:15,831
Ask him to explain his weapon!

239
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:20,418
This sword is named Orcrist,
the Goblin-cleaver!

240
00:22:23,587 --> 00:22:24,963
Murderers!

241
00:22:25,172 --> 00:22:26,673
Elf-friends!

242
00:22:29,634 --> 00:22:31,218
Stop!

243
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,650
I know that sword!

244
00:22:50,026 --> 00:22:55,364
It is called: Glamdring,
the Foe-hammer!

245
00:23:06,164 --> 00:23:09,125
Gandalf! Good old Gandalf!

246
00:23:09,292 --> 00:23:11,585
Follow me! Quickly!

247
00:23:16,256 --> 00:23:19,008
Through here! Follow me!

248
00:23:35,355 --> 00:23:36,481
Bilbo!

249
00:23:37,023 --> 00:23:38,983
He is gone!

250
00:23:51,327 --> 00:23:52,995
Bilbo, where are you?

251
00:24:04,171 --> 00:24:07,382
My precious.

252
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:10,009
It is my precious.

253
00:24:11,552 --> 00:24:15,055
Hello, my precious.

254
00:24:16,181 --> 00:24:18,099
Bless us and splash us.

255
00:24:18,308 --> 00:24:21,560
Food for my precious.

256
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:24,271
Eggs and bacon. ---.

257
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:27,315
--- and sweet butter.

258
00:24:28,942 --> 00:24:32,361
What is that noise, my precious?

259
00:24:33,028 --> 00:24:36,489
My precious does not know.

260
00:24:42,912 --> 00:24:44,746
Bless my soul!

261
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:51,293
Hello! What's this?

262
00:24:56,381 --> 00:25:01,510
A souvenir to show the neighbours
back home. If I ever get home.

263
00:25:06,306 --> 00:25:07,724
Oh, who are you?

264
00:25:08,224 --> 00:25:10,309
Bless us, my precious.

265
00:25:10,518 --> 00:25:15,856
A tasty morsel it would make us.

266
00:25:17,023 --> 00:25:21,027
What is it, my precious?

267
00:25:21,235 --> 00:25:22,861
I am Mr. Bilbo Baggins.

268
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:27,240
I've lost my dwarves,
my wizard and my way.

269
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,744
Mind you, I'm armed
with an elvish blade!

270
00:25:34,621 --> 00:25:38,791
That's better.
Perhaps you know the way out?

271
00:25:41,377 --> 00:25:44,254
Perhaps ye sits here...

272
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:48,174
... and chats with it
a bitsy, my preciousss.

273
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:52,595
It... likes ... riddles?

274
00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:55,055
Do I like riddles?

275
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:58,099
Well, yes, after a fashion.

276
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,727
It must have
a competition with us.

277
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:06,606
If precious asks
and it doesn't answer...

278
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:13,362
... we eat it, my precious.

279
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:14,905
Oh, I say!

280
00:26:15,113 --> 00:26:17,657
But if it asks us...

281
00:26:17,866 --> 00:26:20,118
... and we doesn't answer...

282
00:26:20,535 --> 00:26:21,827
... then we...

283
00:26:22,036 --> 00:26:23,245
... shows it...

284
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,956
...the way out!

285
00:26:26,581 --> 00:26:30,585
- It seems I have no choice.
- My precious...

286
00:26:30,793 --> 00:26:34,421
... we makes the first riddle.

287
00:26:34,796 --> 00:26:36,923
Voiceless it cries,

288
00:26:37,132 --> 00:26:38,967
Wingless flutters,

289
00:26:39,175 --> 00:26:41,218
Toothless bites,

290
00:26:41,427 --> 00:26:44,138
Mouthless mutters.

291
00:26:45,222 --> 00:26:46,598
Can it...

292
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:48,266
... guess...

293
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:50,309
... the answer?

294
00:26:51,018 --> 00:26:52,603
Half a moment.

295
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:57,941
Is it nice, my precious?
Is it juicy?

296
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:59,984
Gluey? Tacky?

297
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:02,570
Is it  scrumptious?

298
00:27:02,778 --> 00:27:04,905
If you please!

299
00:27:06,656 --> 00:27:09,075
Wind!
Wind is the answer!

300
00:27:10,993 --> 00:27:12,244
Now, my turn.

301
00:27:12,995 --> 00:27:16,456
A box without hinges, key, or lid,

302
00:27:16,665 --> 00:27:19,959
Yet golden treasure inside is hid,

303
00:27:20,501 --> 00:27:24,713
Let us give us
a chance, my precious.

304
00:27:28,841 --> 00:27:30,426
Eggs!

305
00:27:30,635 --> 00:27:33,137
Eggs, it is!

306
00:27:33,345 --> 00:27:34,930
Oh, buffer!

307
00:28:10,126 --> 00:28:13,545
Us, now! Now, us, my precious.

308
00:28:13,712 --> 00:28:16,464
I'm a quitter with anticipation!

309
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,508
Now...

310
00:28:19,467 --> 00:28:24,263
This thing all things devours:

311
00:28:24,471 --> 00:28:29,017
Birds, beasts, trees, flowers;

312
00:28:29,225 --> 00:28:32,686
Gnaws iron, bites steel;

313
00:28:32,895 --> 00:28:36,231
Grinds hard stones to meal;

314
00:28:36,439 --> 00:28:40,776
Slays king, ruins town,

315
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:46,323
And beats high mountain down.

316
00:28:51,202 --> 00:28:53,287
Well, interesting.

317
00:28:53,495 --> 00:28:56,039
Yes, now, let me see.

318
00:28:56,456 --> 00:28:59,125
What is the answer?
What is the answer?

319
00:28:59,334 --> 00:29:01,377
Just a moment now!

320
00:29:03,462 --> 00:29:05,130
My precious...

321
00:29:05,339 --> 00:29:09,217
... will it taste delicious?

322
00:29:12,094 --> 00:29:13,929
Yes! It will!

323
00:29:14,096 --> 00:29:16,723
- Give me some time.
- What...

324
00:29:17,432 --> 00:29:20,685
What does it say?

325
00:29:20,893 --> 00:29:22,603
I said: time! Time!

326
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:31,902
Whatever is the matter?

327
00:29:32,111 --> 00:29:34,988
It guess!

328
00:29:35,197 --> 00:29:39,117
Time is the answer!

329
00:29:39,367 --> 00:29:40,910
It is?

330
00:29:42,494 --> 00:29:45,539
I knew it all along.
That's an old one.

331
00:29:45,747 --> 00:29:49,375
Well, fun is fun.
Now couldn't we get out of here?

332
00:29:51,002 --> 00:29:56,339
No! It's got to ask us another
riddle, my precious! Yes! Yes!

333
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,134
Oh, blessed! I can't
think of another one.

334
00:30:00,343 --> 00:30:03,304
Ask! Ask!

335
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:06,097
Oh, very well.

336
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,226
- What have I got in my pocket?
- Not fair! Not fair...

337
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:12,728
to ask my precious...

338
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:15,564
... what it's got in
its nassty little...

339
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:18,316
... pocketses?

340
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:20,943
I'm sorry. That's my riddle.

341
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:25,447
If you can't guess it,
you lose. And show me out!

342
00:30:29,075 --> 00:30:31,994
Oh, my precious loses!

343
00:30:36,331 --> 00:30:38,208
But first...

344
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:41,377
... my precious shows it his...

345
00:30:41,585 --> 00:30:45,130
... something pretty.

346
00:30:45,589 --> 00:30:50,510
- You wish to show me something?
- My birthday present.

347
00:30:55,138 --> 00:30:56,890
Wait! Where are you going?

348
00:30:57,265 --> 00:31:01,227
My precious finds a ring...

349
00:31:01,435 --> 00:31:04,021
... on his birthday...

350
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:07,649
...long ago.

351
00:31:07,857 --> 00:31:11,277
A golden ring.

352
00:31:11,485 --> 00:31:15,989
A magic ring!

353
00:31:19,992 --> 00:31:24,371
We must get my precious, my birthday
present, from its hiding place.

354
00:31:31,961 --> 00:31:33,670
Now, what?

355
00:31:34,129 --> 00:31:37,215
You'll never guess
my pocket contains this.

356
00:31:41,719 --> 00:31:43,470
Bless my soul!

357
00:31:47,057 --> 00:31:48,600
Where is it?

358
00:31:48,808 --> 00:31:52,895
My golden ring!
My magic ring!

359
00:31:53,395 --> 00:31:56,314
It is lost!

360
00:31:56,523 --> 00:31:58,608
Lost!

361
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:00,526
Lost!

362
00:32:00,735 --> 00:32:05,238
Precious! My precious!
My ring, lost!

363
00:32:10,243 --> 00:32:13,871
My precious remembers.

364
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:16,915
He wears it before...

365
00:32:17,123 --> 00:32:20,168
... and he drops it on the shore!

366
00:32:20,376 --> 00:32:23,462
Curse it! Curse the Baggins!

367
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:26,631
He found it!
My ring!

368
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,426
My birthday present!

369
00:32:34,263 --> 00:32:36,723
Am I he does carry on?

370
00:32:41,644 --> 00:32:44,229
Bless my soul!

371
00:32:46,773 --> 00:32:48,066
The ring?

372
00:32:52,361 --> 00:32:54,613
Yes, most definitely.

373
00:32:57,949 --> 00:33:01,786
My precious! We find it!
We find it! The Baggins.

374
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:05,122
My precious will crush it...

375
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:07,415
... and smash it!

376
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:09,834
Better does this.

377
00:33:14,296 --> 00:33:15,881
Where is it?

378
00:33:16,173 --> 00:33:18,007
Where is it?

379
00:33:20,468 --> 00:33:23,846
It is tricksy.

380
00:33:24,054 --> 00:33:28,183
It says it doesn't know
the way out...

381
00:33:28,391 --> 00:33:32,937
... but it knows a way in,
my precious.

382
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:35,439
It must...

383
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:38,942
... know a way out!

384
00:33:42,611 --> 00:33:44,738
It's off to the back door.

385
00:33:44,947 --> 00:33:49,242
My precious must make haste
to the back door.

386
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,952
To the back door!

387
00:33:53,454 --> 00:33:54,788
How convenient.

388
00:33:54,997 --> 00:33:57,707
Well, follow the leader.

389
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:08,341
It's not here, my precious.

390
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:11,927
Escaped! Escaped!

391
00:34:17,515 --> 00:34:19,434
Thief!

392
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:21,435
Thief!

393
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:23,145
Baggins!

394
00:34:23,354 --> 00:34:25,814
We hate it!

395
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:30,526
Hate it for ever!

396
00:34:35,197 --> 00:34:39,867
You see, Gollum thought I knew the way out,
and wished trying to head me off.

397
00:34:40,076 --> 00:34:42,369
I merely followed him to the exit.

398
00:34:42,536 --> 00:34:46,039
We had to fight our way
through the goblin guard.

399
00:34:46,248 --> 00:34:49,334
- How is it they didn't see you?
- Oh, well...

400
00:34:49,542 --> 00:34:52,711
... the art of burgling is really, you know,...

401
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,630
... the art of being unobtrusive.

402
00:34:56,047 --> 00:34:58,925
Invisible, sort of speak.

403
00:34:59,133 --> 00:35:03,387
Your story, Bilbo, has the ring of truth.
Yes, it rings true.

404
00:35:04,388 --> 00:35:07,640
You need say no more. We best gotta move on.

405
00:35:07,849 --> 00:35:10,393
There are still goblins about.

406
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:13,854
Oh, bother! More mountains?

407
00:35:14,855 --> 00:35:16,398
No. Don't you see?

408
00:35:16,606 --> 00:35:20,276
The sun is setting in the west,
behind the mountains.

409
00:35:20,484 --> 00:35:25,614
We are on the other side
to the edge of the Land Beyond.

410
00:35:30,743 --> 00:35:34,037
- A warg!
- With the goblins!

411
00:36:40,551 --> 00:36:44,721
- Help!
- We can't crawl any higher!

412
00:37:16,498 --> 00:37:21,627
- Oh, my arms.
- My poor legs! My legs!

413
00:37:21,836 --> 00:37:27,090
But what do they do with us?
Drop us to our deaths?

414
00:37:27,298 --> 00:37:29,133
Who knows?

415
00:37:29,342 --> 00:37:33,554
But they've brought us of far
distance with no dropping!

416
00:37:33,762 --> 00:37:38,433
Yehoo! The river of Wilderland below!

417
00:37:38,641 --> 00:37:40,351
My thunder!

418
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:45,355
They're taking us to the edge
of Mirkwood Forest...

419
00:37:45,522 --> 00:37:50,318
... to dash us against those rocks,
I know it!

420
00:38:01,243 --> 00:38:03,037
Oh, great lord of eagles...

421
00:38:03,245 --> 00:38:06,540
... we are eternally grateful
for your gallant rescue.

422
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,833
I have not forgotten the arrow...

423
00:38:09,042 --> 00:38:12,378
... that brought me down so many years ago.

424
00:38:12,545 --> 00:38:14,963
I have not forgotten the wizard...

425
00:38:15,172 --> 00:38:18,299
... who found me and healed my wound.

426
00:38:18,758 --> 00:38:19,967
And now...

427
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:23,554
...farewell, wherever you fare...

428
00:38:23,762 --> 00:38:27,140
... to your aeries receive you
at the journey's end.

429
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:38,274
So this is the forest of Mirkwood.

430
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:42,319
Terrible place if I remember.
And dangerous.

431
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:46,823
No-no. The map shows the safest path.

432
00:38:47,032 --> 00:38:50,034
Follow it closely,
straight through the forest.

433
00:38:50,243 --> 00:38:54,663
Don't stray off the track. If you do,
you will never get out of Mirkwood.

434
00:38:54,871 --> 00:38:57,749
You speak as if you ain't going with us.

435
00:38:57,957 --> 00:39:01,836
I'm not. I have pressing business away south.

436
00:39:02,461 --> 00:39:07,048
- Oh, no! He can't mean it!
- What will we do without Gandalf?

437
00:39:07,257 --> 00:39:09,175
Please, don't leave us.

438
00:39:09,384 --> 00:39:13,387
No-no. I'm already late because of
bothering with you, people.

439
00:39:13,595 --> 00:39:17,599
I'm sending Mr. Baggins with you.
That should be enough.

440
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:20,226
- Mr. Baggins?
- Bilbo?

441
00:39:20,434 --> 00:39:21,560
The burglar?

442
00:39:21,852 --> 00:39:25,647
Me? I'm no equal to a wizard!

443
00:39:25,856 --> 00:39:29,192
Nonsense. You are the lucky number.

444
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,071
And soon you'll find out there's
more about you than you guess.

445
00:39:46,456 --> 00:39:50,418
You, sir, will be my surrogate.
My replacement, so the same.

446
00:39:50,626 --> 00:39:55,088
Here is paper and a marker. Keep a
strict log, the remainder of your journey.

447
00:39:55,297 --> 00:39:59,717
... so I may study it when we meet again
and point out your missed steps.

448
00:40:00,218 --> 00:40:02,136
I can only do my best.

449
00:40:02,678 --> 00:40:05,222
Then, I'll have to suffice.

450
00:40:18,942 --> 00:40:22,111
To Gandalf:
As per your instructions... 

451
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:26,573
... I'm keeping this log of our
journey through Mirkwood forest.

452
00:40:26,865 --> 00:40:31,160
I should make good use of it some day
as a base of my memoirs.

453
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:33,329
...which I intend to call:

454
00:40:33,495 --> 00:40:38,124
There and back again: a hobbit's holiday.

455
00:41:02,937 --> 00:41:07,524
The days are terrible,
and the nights are impossible...

456
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:10,026
... for we are hungry and thirsty.

457
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:13,612
The berries which grow here are hideous.

458
00:41:16,364 --> 00:41:19,992
Everything about these woods is unpleasant.

459
00:41:21,994 --> 00:41:23,954
One day we decided someone...

460
00:41:24,163 --> 00:41:28,041
... should climb to the top of the
tallest tree and have a look about.

461
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:32,670
I couldn't argue. My contract
is vague on several points.

462
00:41:58,066 --> 00:41:59,400
There are moments...

463
00:41:59,567 --> 00:42:04,029
... which can change a person for all time.

464
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:09,367
And I suddenly wondered if I would
ever see my snug hobbit hole again.

465
00:42:10,118 --> 00:42:13,662
I wondered, if I actually wanted to.

466
00:42:28,258 --> 00:42:32,178
I awoke the next morning
to a hideous surprise.

467
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,739
Now I will give you a name.

468
00:42:55,947 --> 00:43:00,076
And I shall call you Sting!

469
00:43:05,539 --> 00:43:09,125
The remainder of the morning
I was spending seeking my companions.

470
00:43:09,584 --> 00:43:14,880
And I found them, finally,
in a place as black and terrible...

471
00:43:15,088 --> 00:43:18,716
... as a patch of midnight that
had never been cleared away.

472
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:26,181
They'll make fine eating...

473
00:43:26,806 --> 00:43:29,600
... when they hung a day!

474
00:43:35,731 --> 00:43:37,107
Go away!

475
00:43:37,357 --> 00:43:39,442
Go away!

476
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:41,277
Bombur!

477
00:43:51,494 --> 00:43:55,330
I certainly could not let
my companions, my comrades...

478
00:43:55,539 --> 00:44:00,710
... become of meal for these hideous spiders.
Action was called for.

479
00:44:16,473 --> 00:44:20,851
Now you are all free. I know, the
spiders' poison have made you weak,

480
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:24,354
but you must follow me. Quickly!

481
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:32,945
Look! On the path ahead! There it is.

482
00:44:33,153 --> 00:44:35,947
It has freed our supper!

483
00:44:36,364 --> 00:44:38,366
Now we see you again!

484
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:43,912
We will eat you and leave
your skin hanging in a tree.

485
00:44:45,288 --> 00:44:46,540
Grab it!

486
00:44:48,124 --> 00:44:51,877
I think I can hold them on!
Run to the wood-elves' clearing!

487
00:44:52,044 --> 00:44:54,129
But, how can you...

488
00:44:54,338 --> 00:44:57,007
I will do the stinging. Run.

489
00:44:57,465 --> 00:44:59,384
Swiftly, now!

490
00:45:00,259 --> 00:45:04,888
We have trapped them now.
Close the circle.

491
00:45:05,097 --> 00:45:07,349
It can't escape us!

492
00:45:13,562 --> 00:45:16,356
Lazy Lob!
Attercop!

493
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:24,196
My bless! What is it?

494
00:45:24,696 --> 00:45:28,449
Sting! Sting! Sting!

495
00:45:34,246 --> 00:45:39,417
Away! Retreat!
We are no match for Sting!

496
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:50,635
I joined my companions at
the clearing of the wood-elves.

497
00:45:50,843 --> 00:45:54,513
But when I found them,
I was in for another surprise.

498
00:45:55,097 --> 00:45:59,517
The wood-elves had returned,
but armed for battle.

499
00:45:59,934 --> 00:46:03,729
The dwarves, weakened as they were
by the encounter with the spiders...

500
00:46:03,937 --> 00:46:05,564
... gave up without a struggle.

501
00:46:13,404 --> 00:46:15,655
We travelled all day and into the night.

502
00:46:15,864 --> 00:46:18,992
Finally, we came to the palace
of the elf king...

503
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,453
... which was of the very
eastern edge of the forest.

504
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:25,080
We'd come all the way through...

505
00:46:25,288 --> 00:46:29,125
... only to end up as prisoners.

506
00:46:32,711 --> 00:46:36,131
- Why did you dwarves try to attack?
- No attack!

507
00:46:36,339 --> 00:46:39,425
We came to beg!
We were starving!

508
00:46:39,634 --> 00:46:42,511
And why were you in the forest
in the first place?

509
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,472
- That is our business.
- Very well.

510
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,350
Take them away until they are
feeling inclined to tell the truth...

511
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:51,602
... even if they wait a hundred years!

512
00:46:52,269 --> 00:46:57,107
Greed. The fortune we were after
was big enough to share with the elves.

513
00:46:57,315 --> 00:47:02,486
They'd make valuable allies
against that old worm Smaug.

514
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:09,492
Instead, they became the enemy
and we were their prisoners.

515
00:47:12,244 --> 00:47:16,790
And even though my invisibility
allowed me to move about with ease...

516
00:47:16,998 --> 00:47:20,376
... I had no way of opening the locks.

517
00:47:20,585 --> 00:47:25,464
So it was weeks before I found
a way to free my companions.

518
00:47:26,715 --> 00:47:29,050
Part of the river flowed under the caves.

519
00:47:29,258 --> 00:47:32,720
Deliveries of fine wines were
brought up the river by human men...

520
00:47:32,928 --> 00:47:35,263
... who lived on Long Lake.

521
00:47:35,472 --> 00:47:39,976
Now wood-elves enjoyed their wine
and the barrels were soon drained.

522
00:48:07,749 --> 00:48:09,667
Oh, stop complaining!

523
00:48:09,917 --> 00:48:14,129
I never promised to burgle you
first class accomodation.

524
00:48:29,058 --> 00:48:32,561
I'd come far and through
many adventures to see it...

525
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:37,232
... and now I did not like
the look of it at all!

526
00:48:43,529 --> 00:48:47,532
Within hours we reached the colony
of humans called Lake-town.

527
00:48:47,741 --> 00:48:50,243
A precise, if not too imaginative name...

528
00:48:50,451 --> 00:48:55,247
... but the village was actually
built on the surface of Long Lake.

529
00:48:58,208 --> 00:49:02,086
Here, the descendants of the men
of Dale still dare to dwell...

530
00:49:02,253 --> 00:49:07,549
... and do business in the shadow
of old Smaug's mountain.

531
00:49:15,138 --> 00:49:17,098
I am Thorin...

532
00:49:17,307 --> 00:49:20,768
... grand son of King under the Mountain!

533
00:49:20,977 --> 00:49:25,439
I have returned!

534
00:49:40,618 --> 00:49:42,870
Hail, Thorin Oakenshield.

535
00:49:43,078 --> 00:49:47,749
I am Bard the guardsman.
We are honoured by your presence.

536
00:49:47,957 --> 00:49:51,293
Your grandfather lives
in our songs and legends.

537
00:49:51,627 --> 00:49:55,964
What help we can offer will be yours,
and we trust to your gratitude...

538
00:49:56,506 --> 00:50:01,093
... the dragon Smaug is killed
and your kingdom is regained.

539
00:50:10,518 --> 00:50:13,145
We were fed, fattened, given supplies...

540
00:50:13,354 --> 00:50:17,607
... and two weeks later found us
near in the end of our journey.

541
00:50:17,816 --> 00:50:22,570
And chances were, it would be
a very horrible end, indeed.

542
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:35,956
That smell!
I've not smelled a dragon before!

543
00:50:36,164 --> 00:50:41,377
All the halls within must be
filled with his foul reek.

544
00:50:44,254 --> 00:50:46,631
And while Smaug slept inside...

545
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:51,802
... we spent our days searching for
that illusive secret door.

546
00:50:52,011 --> 00:50:54,513
Then, one afternoon...

547
00:50:55,013 --> 00:51:00,351
And so, Gandalf, while I wait,
I inscribe the final pages of your log.

548
00:51:03,187 --> 00:51:07,273
My only companion is an annoying bird
cracking snails.

549
00:51:08,608 --> 00:51:13,570
"Stand by the grey stone
when the thrush knocks,

550
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:16,615
... and the last light
of the setting sun...

551
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:20,743
... will shine upon the keyhole."

552
00:51:22,786 --> 00:51:25,122
Oh, my goodness!

553
00:51:25,706 --> 00:51:28,208
Wake up! Wake up! It's happening!

554
00:51:28,416 --> 00:51:30,001
My thunder!

555
00:51:35,005 --> 00:51:36,506
There it is!

556
00:51:42,261 --> 00:51:45,555
Thorin, before it's gone again,
use your key.

557
00:51:58,274 --> 00:52:00,568
Well, here we are.

558
00:52:02,403 --> 00:52:03,946
But, what now?

559
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:09,200
Now is the time for our esteemed
Mr. Baggins to perform the service...

560
00:52:09,409 --> 00:52:12,786
... for which he was included
in our company.

561
00:52:12,995 --> 00:52:18,333
- Me?
- You must earn your reward. We do have a contract.

562
00:52:18,541 --> 00:52:21,210
You think it's my job: to go in first?

563
00:52:21,419 --> 00:52:26,173
I've already got you out of two
messes not in the original bargain.

564
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:28,841
And who will come with me?

565
00:52:29,342 --> 00:52:31,052
Any of you?

566
00:52:31,594 --> 00:52:33,053
I see.

567
00:52:33,387 --> 00:52:36,056
Well, you are the burglar.

568
00:52:36,264 --> 00:52:38,975
Go down and burgle something.

569
00:52:39,183 --> 00:52:42,436
Very well. I won't refuse.

570
00:52:44,104 --> 00:52:45,230
Good luck.

571
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,065
Thank you.

572
00:52:47,399 --> 00:52:51,277
I've begun to trust my luck
more than in the old days.

573
00:52:59,033 --> 00:53:02,828
Now, you're in for it at last, Bilbo Baggins.

574
00:53:03,037 --> 00:53:07,624
Why are you here? You've no use
for dragon treasures.

575
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:28,391
Feel the worm's heat, Mr. Baggins?

576
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,935
A few more steps and you shall see...

577
00:53:31,143 --> 00:53:34,563
... the old dragon Smaug at last.

578
00:53:39,567 --> 00:53:41,986
You can still turn back, you know.

579
00:53:42,153 --> 00:53:46,781
But to go on, to take those steps...

580
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:50,826
... that would be the bravest
of all moments.

581
00:53:51,035 --> 00:53:54,329
Whatever happens afterwards is nothing.

582
00:53:55,372 --> 00:53:57,916
Yes, here is where...

583
00:53:58,124 --> 00:54:01,961
... you fight your real battle,
Mr. Bilbo Baggins.

584
00:54:02,503 --> 00:54:04,296
Do you go back?

585
00:54:53,796 --> 00:54:55,547
Well, thief...

586
00:54:57,007 --> 00:55:00,551
... I smell you, feel your air.

587
00:55:01,635 --> 00:55:04,012
I hear your breath.

588
00:55:05,555 --> 00:55:07,098
Come on!

589
00:55:08,141 --> 00:55:12,311
Help yourself. There is plenty and to spare.

590
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:17,065
Oh, thank you, oh, Smaug the Magnificent.

591
00:55:17,816 --> 00:55:21,902
I did not come for presents.
I only wish to have a look at you...

592
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:25,739
... and see if you are truly
as great as tales say.

593
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:28,158
I did not believe them.

594
00:55:30,034 --> 00:55:31,410
Do you, now?

595
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:35,122
They fall utterly short of the reality...

596
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:40,543
... oh Smaug, the Chiefest and Greatest of Calamities!

597
00:55:44,922 --> 00:55:48,591
You have nice manners for a thief...

598
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,426
... and a liar.

599
00:55:52,344 --> 00:55:53,887
You know me...

600
00:55:55,347 --> 00:55:58,975
... but I don't remember smelling you before.

601
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:05,272
Who are you and where do you come from?

602
00:56:06,022 --> 00:56:08,066
I come from under the hill.

603
00:56:08,274 --> 00:56:11,736
And under the hill and over the hills my paths led.

604
00:56:11,944 --> 00:56:16,573
And through the air.
I am he that walks unseen.

605
00:56:17,032 --> 00:56:18,616
You make riddles?

606
00:56:20,701 --> 00:56:22,244
What is your name?

607
00:56:22,453 --> 00:56:27,374
I am the lucky number,
the web-cutter, the spider sting...

608
00:56:27,582 --> 00:56:29,083
Lovely titles.

609
00:56:29,292 --> 00:56:34,087
I am he that drowns his friends
and draws them alive again from the water.

610
00:56:34,296 --> 00:56:39,050
I am the guest of eagles,
the Ringwinner, and the Luckwearer.

611
00:56:39,258 --> 00:56:42,344
... the clue-finder and the Barrel-rider.

612
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:44,596
Barrel-rider, eh?

613
00:56:46,014 --> 00:56:48,683
Then I have guessed your riddle!

614
00:56:49,475 --> 00:56:52,353
You are one of those miserable...

615
00:56:52,561 --> 00:56:54,479
... tub-trading lakemen!

616
00:56:55,522 --> 00:57:00,443
You and your town shall pay
dearly for this intrusion!

617
00:57:02,444 --> 00:57:05,989
So the lakemen would steal my treasure?

618
00:57:08,575 --> 00:57:12,912
Wait! You don't know everything.
Not gold alone brought me hither.

619
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:15,372
Be done with your riddles!

620
00:57:16,331 --> 00:57:19,334
What else got you, Lakeman?

621
00:57:21,711 --> 00:57:23,170
Revenge!

622
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:27,465
Revenge?

623
00:57:27,799 --> 00:57:30,343
Surely you must realized
that your success...

624
00:57:30,551 --> 00:57:32,970
... has made you some bitter enemies.

625
00:57:45,522 --> 00:57:49,650
Revenge? You? Ha!

626
00:57:51,527 --> 00:57:55,280
I am Smaug!

627
00:57:56,781 --> 00:57:58,575
I kill what I wish!

628
00:57:59,992 --> 00:58:01,952
I am strong...

629
00:58:02,369 --> 00:58:03,871
... strong...

630
00:58:04,997 --> 00:58:06,414
... strong!

631
00:58:09,876 --> 00:58:12,878
My armor is like tenfold shields...

632
00:58:13,087 --> 00:58:15,380
... my teeth are like swords...

633
00:58:15,589 --> 00:58:18,049
... my claws, spears...

634
00:58:18,466 --> 00:58:20,426
... the shock of my tail...

635
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,886
... a thunderbolt!

636
00:58:24,721 --> 00:58:26,515
My wings...

637
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:29,851
... a hurricane!

638
00:58:36,982 --> 00:58:39,317
And my breath...

639
00:58:41,402 --> 00:58:42,695
... death!

640
00:58:45,072 --> 00:58:46,198
Well?

641
00:58:48,449 --> 00:58:49,909
Well?

642
00:58:50,118 --> 00:58:53,203
Where are your riddles now?

643
00:58:54,329 --> 00:58:56,831
Very, very impressive.

644
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,166
However...

645
00:58:58,958 --> 00:59:02,586
... I have always understood
that dragons...

646
00:59:02,795 --> 00:59:06,047
... were soft underneath. Vulnerable.

647
00:59:06,423 --> 00:59:09,884
Especially, in the region of the chest.

648
00:59:10,092 --> 00:59:12,428
You have heard wrong!

649
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:17,182
I am armoured above and below

650
00:59:17,849 --> 00:59:20,935
Well, I don't know about that.

651
00:59:21,143 --> 00:59:23,812
"You don't know about that."

652
00:59:24,521 --> 00:59:26,690
I shall show you!

653
00:59:29,108 --> 00:59:30,026
Look!

654
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:33,278
What do you say to this?

655
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:36,615
Rare and wonderful, eh?

656
00:59:39,283 --> 00:59:40,743
Dazzling!

657
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:42,286
Marvellous!

658
00:59:42,494 --> 00:59:43,704
Perfect!

659
00:59:43,954 --> 00:59:44,997
Flawless!

660
00:59:45,205 --> 00:59:47,374
Staggering! Mag...

661
00:59:48,416 --> 00:59:50,334
Old fool!

662
00:59:50,543 --> 00:59:54,755
There is a patch in the hollow
of your left breast...

663
00:59:54,963 --> 00:59:57,966
... as bare as a snail out of its shell.

664
01:00:00,343 --> 01:00:01,260
What's that?

665
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,054
More riddles?

666
01:00:04,805 --> 01:00:06,932
No, my riddling is done.

667
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:11,977
I really must not detain
Your Magnificence any longer.

668
01:00:12,144 --> 01:00:17,107
Sorry you could not find me.
But a fine burglar takes expert catching.

669
01:00:19,609 --> 01:00:20,818
Burgler?

670
01:00:25,781 --> 01:00:29,575
Burgler!

671
01:00:33,912 --> 01:00:38,666
Thief! Fire! Murder!

672
01:00:46,006 --> 01:00:49,467
- We should have gone with him.
- To be roasted alive?

673
01:00:49,675 --> 01:00:51,469
It's the burglar!

674
01:00:51,677 --> 01:00:54,471
Three cheers for good old Bilbo!

675
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:58,308
Thank you! But I'd appreciate
a more pragmatic salute.

676
01:00:58,516 --> 01:00:59,726
In other words...

677
01:00:59,934 --> 01:01:03,103
... extinguish me!

678
01:01:05,647 --> 01:01:09,275
There we go! There we go!
Always glad to help a  friend.

679
01:01:09,484 --> 01:01:12,319
I can' tell you how grateful I am.

680
01:01:12,528 --> 01:01:15,364
Oh, never mind that. What did you burgle?

681
01:01:15,864 --> 01:01:17,198
This.

682
01:01:19,826 --> 01:01:20,993
What's that?

683
01:01:21,243 --> 01:01:22,661
Earthquake?

684
01:01:55,063 --> 01:01:57,816
Into the secret passage! Our only chance!

685
01:02:00,568 --> 01:02:02,611
Barrel-rider!

686
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:05,405
Thief Lakemen!

687
01:02:05,739 --> 01:02:10,409
Your people shall see my vengeance!

688
01:02:17,582 --> 01:02:19,959
The lake people are doomed, unless...

689
01:02:20,168 --> 01:02:24,588
Yes, you! You are a mere trush,
and yet, so much more.

690
01:02:24,796 --> 01:02:28,591
You have seen Smaug.
You know his vulnerable spot!

691
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:33,762
Go now! To Lake-town!
There's a guardsman, Bard. Tell him!

692
01:02:44,271 --> 01:02:47,065
This breeze is strangely warm for autumn.

693
01:02:47,982 --> 01:02:49,567
Bard! What's that?

694
01:02:53,821 --> 01:02:56,489
The dragon is coming, or I'm a fool!

695
01:02:56,698 --> 01:03:00,451
Cut the bridges! To arms! To arms!

696
01:03:03,078 --> 01:03:04,871
The dragon! Old Smaug!

697
01:03:05,288 --> 01:03:08,625
Awake after all these years!
The dragon is coming!

698
01:03:24,388 --> 01:03:27,223
Ready? As he passes over...

699
01:03:28,558 --> 01:03:29,767
Arrows!

700
01:03:38,983 --> 01:03:40,776
--- Rearm!

701
01:03:53,829 --> 01:03:56,498
Away, you fool bird! Away!

702
01:03:58,041 --> 01:03:59,167
You speak?

703
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:02,962
Bilbo Baggins?

704
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:04,713
He found what?

705
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:07,674
Yes! I'll look!

706
01:04:11,677 --> 01:04:15,097
You speak the truth, old thrush!

707
01:04:17,432 --> 01:04:21,352
Black arrow, you've never failed me.
And I've always recovered you.

708
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:24,646
I had you from my father and he from of old.

709
01:04:24,855 --> 01:04:28,816
If ever you came from the forges of
the true King under the Mountain...

710
01:04:29,025 --> 01:04:30,985
... go now and speed well!

711
01:05:04,138 --> 01:05:06,056
Now I am king!

712
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,474
Stop!

713
01:05:07,891 --> 01:05:11,977
There is only one King under
the Mountain, and I am he...

714
01:05:12,186 --> 01:05:13,020
... Thorin!

715
01:05:13,228 --> 01:05:17,649
Hail Thorin!
Hip hip hurrah! Hip hip hurrah!

716
01:05:18,608 --> 01:05:20,151
Now, now...

717
01:05:20,902 --> 01:05:25,364
... much have be done.
We must cataloge our wealth.

718
01:05:25,572 --> 01:05:28,700
Dear me! And pack it for shipment.

719
01:05:32,244 --> 01:05:35,414
Join the fun, burgler! Part of this is yours!

720
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:38,750
Might be mine! What if Smaug returns?

721
01:05:38,917 --> 01:05:43,837
Oh, he've gone for a week now!
Found greener pastures, no doubt.

722
01:05:44,046 --> 01:05:46,423
Has this wealth made you mad?

723
01:05:46,590 --> 01:05:49,300
We must find our way
out of this mountain...

724
01:05:49,509 --> 01:05:52,011
... and see for ourselves
if he's gone, and quickly!

725
01:05:52,595 --> 01:05:56,681
According to this map, the main gate
lies in this direction.

726
01:05:56,890 --> 01:05:58,933
Follow me, gentlemen!

727
01:06:04,479 --> 01:06:06,022
Bless my soul!

728
01:06:06,273 --> 01:06:07,732
What are they?

729
01:06:08,149 --> 01:06:12,403
Is the entire valley flowed?
Populated by giant fireflies?

730
01:06:12,611 --> 01:06:15,238
Not fireflies! Fires! Campfires!

731
01:06:15,614 --> 01:06:18,741
Nonsense! Not an army would need
that many fires.

732
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:21,577
No, my friend. Two armies!

733
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:26,373
Bard of Lake-town? What did you say?

734
01:06:26,706 --> 01:06:28,249
Two armies!

735
01:06:28,666 --> 01:06:33,462
Smaug is dead. I have slein him.
The thrush delivered your message.

736
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:38,049
Really? Splendid news, our fellow!I hoped he would!

737
01:06:38,258 --> 01:06:40,384
My people have made me king.

738
01:06:40,593 --> 01:06:43,595
King? Really? Congratulations!

739
01:06:43,804 --> 01:06:48,433
Couldn't happen to a nicer chap. Really!
I don't know how to thank you.

740
01:06:48,641 --> 01:06:51,394
Our town is destroyed and must be rebuilt.

741
01:06:51,602 --> 01:06:54,104
You can thank us by sharing your fortune.

742
01:06:54,313 --> 01:06:57,649
Why of course, of course.
There's plenty for all.

743
01:06:57,857 --> 01:07:02,444
Wait! The fortune is ours!
And belongs to dwarves alone!

744
01:07:02,653 --> 01:07:05,781
It wouldn't be yours if Smaug do lived.

745
01:07:05,989 --> 01:07:07,741
A technicality.

746
01:07:07,949 --> 01:07:12,661
- So you brought two armies to take it?
- I brought one army.

747
01:07:12,870 --> 01:07:14,496
The other is mine!

748
01:07:15,831 --> 01:07:18,249
You, who threw us into the dungeon?

749
01:07:18,458 --> 01:07:22,670
My people have suffered greatly
from the worm through the years.

750
01:07:22,878 --> 01:07:24,630
We demand retribution.

751
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:26,339
Never!

752
01:07:26,548 --> 01:07:29,801
But why not? There's enough
for all in this mountain.

753
01:07:30,009 --> 01:07:32,803
It's a matter of principle, of honour!

754
01:07:33,178 --> 01:07:35,430
Then, tomorrow we take it!

755
01:07:35,639 --> 01:07:38,641
We will meet at sunrise on the field of battle.

756
01:07:38,850 --> 01:07:41,310
You realize you're hopelessly outnumbered.

757
01:07:41,519 --> 01:07:43,187
This is ridiculous!

758
01:07:43,395 --> 01:07:46,648
Quiet! What does a burgler
know of these matters?

759
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:49,067
Then tomorrow, it is!

760
01:08:06,373 --> 01:08:11,210
This is deucedly uncomfortable.
I'm certain to get a rash.

761
01:08:11,711 --> 01:08:15,464
That armor was forged
in the foundries of my grandfather.

762
01:08:15,672 --> 01:08:19,550
Wear it proudly and it will
carry you to victory!

763
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:21,927
--- and be bothered victory!

764
01:08:22,136 --> 01:08:25,847
My only hope is to be taken prisoner
as quickly as possible.

765
01:08:26,056 --> 01:08:28,141
Those are the words of a covard.

766
01:08:28,349 --> 01:08:31,018
The covard who flushed out Smaug?

767
01:08:31,227 --> 01:08:34,688
The covard who saved you
time and time again?

768
01:08:34,896 --> 01:08:38,816
The covard who always went forward
while you cringed behind?

769
01:08:39,025 --> 01:08:41,402
You don't see us cringing now, do you?

770
01:08:41,902 --> 01:08:45,781
This is madness!
Fourteen against ten thousand...

771
01:08:45,989 --> 01:08:49,075
... and yet to march off
to certain destruction...

772
01:08:49,283 --> 01:08:52,828
... as if you were on your way
for another tea-party.

773
01:08:53,037 --> 01:08:55,997
Your kind will never understand war, hobbit.

774
01:08:56,206 --> 01:08:58,625
This is war! War!

775
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:05,881
Our lookout has found something!

776
01:09:07,674 --> 01:09:10,218
Oh, great King under the Mountain!

777
01:09:10,718 --> 01:09:14,054
- Balin, it's only Thorin!
- Quiet!

778
01:09:14,263 --> 01:09:16,723
- Yes, general?
- "General"?

779
01:09:16,932 --> 01:09:20,476
Another army approaches from the north-east!

780
01:09:20,685 --> 01:09:23,771
An army of our kind. An army of dwarves!

781
01:09:24,229 --> 01:09:27,941
- My cousin Dain from the Iron Hills?
- Non other!

782
01:09:28,775 --> 01:09:33,237
Ha! Now, we are not outnumbered!
Now we have an army!

783
01:09:33,445 --> 01:09:37,282
- A battle of three armies?
- To war!

784
01:09:40,785 --> 01:09:41,911
Onward!

785
01:09:42,203 --> 01:09:43,537
Forward!

786
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:45,122
To battle!

787
01:09:47,791 --> 01:09:49,584
- scurvy dwarves!
- Thieving dwarves!

788
01:09:49,792 --> 01:09:50,626
Kill them!

789
01:09:50,793 --> 01:09:52,586
- Chop them!
- Take their heads!

790
01:09:52,962 --> 01:09:55,630
Kill the men! Kill the elves!

791
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:58,299
Save the gold for ourselves!

792
01:10:00,801 --> 01:10:02,970
Personally, I would be back in Hobbiton.

793
01:10:06,973 --> 01:10:10,143
- Who's that old man?
- Get out of the way!

794
01:10:10,476 --> 01:10:12,103
- Move, you old fool!

795
01:10:12,603 --> 01:10:13,812
Old fool?

796
01:10:14,605 --> 01:10:16,106
Gandalf!

797
01:10:16,439 --> 01:10:17,440
Halt!

798
01:10:18,691 --> 01:10:21,319
I would speak with the kings!

799
01:10:23,195 --> 01:10:25,280
Dread has come upon you all!

800
01:10:25,489 --> 01:10:29,826
An army of goblins with claim
to the treasure comes from the north!

801
01:10:30,034 --> 01:10:31,285
Behold!

802
01:10:35,455 --> 01:10:37,832
They ride on wolves!

803
01:10:40,334 --> 01:10:43,379
Oh, great Elf King, my truest friend and ally.

804
01:10:43,587 --> 01:10:46,756
We must join our forces
against this common scourge.

805
01:10:47,382 --> 01:10:50,968
But of course, oh noble
King under the Mountain.

806
01:10:51,177 --> 01:10:54,012
Your people are like brothers onto mine.

807
01:10:54,179 --> 01:10:57,599
And my men and all their weapons
are as one with yours.

808
01:10:57,807 --> 01:11:00,601
Together we will vanquish the foul foe!

809
01:11:01,227 --> 01:11:02,353
Together!

810
01:11:02,811 --> 01:11:07,816
Thorin is correct.
I simply do not understand war.

811
01:11:26,706 --> 01:11:28,666
A battle of four armies.

812
01:11:28,875 --> 01:11:32,253
One, two, three... yes, four!

813
01:11:34,713 --> 01:11:39,634
Our cause is hopeless!
The goblins are too powerful!

814
01:11:39,842 --> 01:11:43,345
But we'll spill much of their blood
before the day has finished.

815
01:11:43,554 --> 01:11:47,474
If these be our last moments, men,
let us live them with honour.

816
01:11:47,682 --> 01:11:52,561
Hold! All is not lost.
The goblins have many enemies.

817
01:11:52,770 --> 01:11:55,564
There is yet still another army on the way.

818
01:11:56,731 --> 01:11:58,066
The eagles!

819
01:12:01,277 --> 01:12:03,237
Five armies now?

820
01:12:03,404 --> 01:12:07,991
Mr. Bilbo Baggins, enough is enough.

821
01:12:39,517 --> 01:12:41,310
Bombur! You're hurt!

822
01:12:41,519 --> 01:12:44,521
I still live. And you?

823
01:12:44,730 --> 01:12:48,525
A slight wound. Crack on the head.
Out for hours. What happened?

824
01:12:48,733 --> 01:12:51,152
We won.

825
01:12:57,490 --> 01:13:00,034
Bombur gone, too?

826
01:13:00,284 --> 01:13:03,203
Of our original thirteen, how many are left?

827
01:13:03,412 --> 01:13:04,371
Seven.

828
01:13:04,663 --> 01:13:06,414
And Thorin?

829
01:13:07,123 --> 01:13:09,709
Soon will be only six.

830
01:13:13,712 --> 01:13:15,130
I have brought him.

831
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:17,507
Farewell, good thief.

832
01:13:18,258 --> 01:13:21,010
I wish to part in friendship...

833
01:13:21,218 --> 01:13:23,762
... and would take back
my words at the Gate.

834
01:13:23,971 --> 01:13:26,598
There are many words I would take back also.

835
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,767
And does it take this...

836
01:13:29,976 --> 01:13:32,436
... to make us each other?

837
01:13:32,811 --> 01:13:34,605
- Thorin!
- Hush!

838
01:13:35,689 --> 01:13:40,484
You are no covard, my friend.
I am sorry I so named you.

839
01:13:40,693 --> 01:13:43,570
- This is not important...
- And I was wrong.

840
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:47,157
You did understand war.

841
01:13:47,907 --> 01:13:50,868
It was I who did not.

842
01:13:52,161 --> 01:13:53,620
Until now.

843
01:13:54,163 --> 01:13:56,998
Farewell, King under the Mountain.

844
01:13:58,166 --> 01:14:00,835
Child of the kindly west.

845
01:14:01,836 --> 01:14:03,796
I have come to know...

846
01:14:05,005 --> 01:14:08,591
... If more of us valued your ways,...

847
01:14:08,925 --> 01:14:12,636
... food and cheer above hoarded gold,...

848
01:14:13,512 --> 01:14:17,474
... it would be a merrier world.

849
01:14:18,516 --> 01:14:20,643
But sad or merry...

850
01:14:21,477 --> 01:14:23,771
... I must leave it now.

851
01:14:25,647 --> 01:14:29,442
- Farewell.
- Farewell, Thorin.

852
01:14:40,284 --> 01:14:44,037
You take only two tiny bags of gold
home with you?

853
01:14:44,746 --> 01:14:46,706
Your share was greater.

854
01:14:46,873 --> 01:14:51,127
It's all my pony could carry,
and it's more than I'll ever need.

855
01:14:51,335 --> 01:14:53,212
But you have other prizes.

856
01:14:53,504 --> 01:14:55,505
The ring? Oh, yes.

857
01:14:55,797 --> 01:15:00,426
I'll keep it as a souvenir
in a glass box, on the mantel.

858
01:15:02,011 --> 01:15:05,806
And so, the prophecies of all
have come true.

859
01:15:06,014 --> 01:15:10,393
Smaug is gone and the goblins driven away.

860
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:13,354
The dwarves and elves live in peace...

861
01:15:13,562 --> 01:15:17,899
... and the men thrive,
multiply and build a civilization.

862
01:15:18,108 --> 01:15:19,734
Prophecies!

863
01:15:19,942 --> 01:15:22,403
- What?
- I had a hand in all that!

864
01:15:22,570 --> 01:15:27,032
Surely you don't disbelieve the prophecies
because you helped bring them about?

865
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:28,992
You don't really suppose, do you,...

866
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:33,537
... that all your adventures and
escapes were managed by mere luck...

867
01:15:33,746 --> 01:15:36,373
... just for your sole benefit?

868
01:15:36,915 --> 01:15:41,127
You're a very fine person, Mr. Baggins.
And I'm very fond of you...

869
01:15:41,335 --> 01:15:46,131
... but you're only quite a little
fellow in a wide world, after all.

870
01:15:46,339 --> 01:15:48,424
Thank goodness!

871
01:15:49,926 --> 01:15:53,012
Yes, you'll returned your home...

872
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:56,181
... place your souvenir ring
on your mantel...

873
01:15:56,389 --> 01:16:00,101
... publish your story, which
you believe has come to its end...

874
01:16:00,309 --> 01:16:03,062
What dod you mean:
"believe it has come to an end"?

875
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:05,689
It has, hasn't it?

876
01:16:05,897 --> 01:16:10,401
Oh, Bilbo Baggins,
if you really understood that ring...

877
01:16:10,610 --> 01:16:14,696
... - but someday members of
your family not yet born will - ...

878
01:16:14,905 --> 01:16:18,658
... then you'd realize
that this story has not ended...

879
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:20,785
