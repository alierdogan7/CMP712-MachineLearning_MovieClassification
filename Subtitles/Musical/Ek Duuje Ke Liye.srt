1
00:00:00,621 --> 00:00:03,250
And if you find time,roam around
Hyderabad, look at the city's charm

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:05,927
Look at the beauty
you'll enjoy

3
00:00:06,294 --> 00:00:07,420
And if possible,go on a
blind date...

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,598
In the evening,go for a movie
have you seen the film Pakizah?

5
00:00:14,803 --> 00:00:15,428
No...

6
00:00:15,804 --> 00:00:17,601
You haven't seen?Hey,what
are you upto?

7
00:00:17,806 --> 00:00:19,433
Hey,that's a poem

8
00:00:19,975 --> 00:00:20,600
Poem...?

9
00:00:25,647 --> 00:00:26,272
Brother, where are you lost?

10
00:00:45,834 --> 00:00:48,632
Aunty... I've come...

11
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:54,976
Aunty... where are you?

12
00:00:55,343 --> 00:00:56,810
Hey,Chakravarthy,come...

13
00:00:57,345 --> 00:01:00,473
Where are your Lotus feet,they
are here,one minute...

14
00:01:00,849 --> 00:01:03,477
Let me cleanse this birth of
mine by touching your Lotus feet

15
00:01:03,685 --> 00:01:04,811
And brighten the next birth
of mine

16
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:05,987
God bless you...

17
00:01:06,354 --> 00:01:09,152
How is everyone in Lucknow,your
mother,your father...?

18
00:01:09,357 --> 00:01:10,654
Hey,leave all those
oldies aside

19
00:01:11,192 --> 00:01:12,159
Where's Sapna baby?

20
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,662
Hey,since morning,she's standing
on one leg and waiting for you

21
00:01:20,035 --> 00:01:20,660
Look, she's here...

22
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:22,996
Sapna,look,who's come?

23
00:01:23,538 --> 00:01:24,664
Come Chakravarthy,come...

24
00:01:25,206 --> 00:01:28,004
Since morning, I've been waiting
only for you standing on one leg

25
00:01:29,544 --> 00:01:30,670
Don't you have manners
of speaking?

26
00:01:39,054 --> 00:01:42,512
Wow! I think you're a new Piegon
who has entered this hotel

27
00:01:44,893 --> 00:01:48,852
My name is Baby, I stay
downstairs

28
00:01:49,064 --> 00:01:50,031
My name is Vasu
- What?

29
00:01:50,565 --> 00:01:52,032
My name is Vasu

30
00:01:56,571 --> 00:01:58,368
Your moustache is really
wonderful

31
00:01:59,908 --> 00:02:01,034
Will you come for a movie
with me in the evening?

32
00:02:01,743 --> 00:02:03,711
I don't understand Hindi
very well

33
00:02:04,245 --> 00:02:06,873
Boss,who goes to a movie
to understand it?

34
00:02:07,248 --> 00:02:08,875
I think,I'm too fast
for you

35
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,548
I shouldn't have asked you
so early for a movie

36
00:02:14,422 --> 00:02:15,548
I'll again ask you after
2 days

37
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,387
Chakravarthy,you should show
your Manliness

38
00:02:21,763 --> 00:02:24,561
Aunty,then you yourself suggest
what should I do?

39
00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:28,068
First,you stop sneezing

40
00:02:28,603 --> 00:02:31,572
After you have come,Sapna should
slowly forget Vasu

41
00:02:32,273 --> 00:02:35,071
And not only that,Vasu's name should
get erased from Sapna's heart

42
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:54,086
How's it?

43
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,097
Very good,my lord,very good

44
00:02:58,133 --> 00:03:01,102
But,what if we change it's
alignment a little,then?

45
00:03:02,971 --> 00:03:03,596
How?

46
00:03:10,311 --> 00:03:10,777
That's all

47
00:03:11,312 --> 00:03:13,940
It means,that's all madam
full stop

48
00:03:15,316 --> 00:03:19,275
Enough of match stick play,please
come to the movie

49
00:03:19,988 --> 00:03:21,615
Really,it'll be very
enjoyable

50
00:03:23,024 --> 00:03:24,286
If it's not palatable
for madam

51
00:03:24,492 --> 00:03:25,618
Then,madam can watch
the movie inside

52
00:03:26,161 --> 00:03:28,789
And your slave will watch
the posters outside...

53
00:03:28,997 --> 00:03:33,024
I'll wait for the lady

54
00:03:33,468 --> 00:03:35,459
No Chakran,I've lots to do

55
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,637
What work do you have?

56
00:03:39,307 --> 00:03:40,171
This one

57
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,215
Sir
- Yes!

58
00:03:50,418 --> 00:03:51,476
I've a small doubt

59
00:03:51,853 --> 00:03:52,649
About what?

60
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:54,686
About an agreement

61
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,957
There're 1 Lakh agreements
in the office-

62
00:03:57,158 --> 00:03:58,090
Which one are you referring to?

63
00:03:58,593 --> 00:03:59,821
Love agreement,sir

64
00:04:01,563 --> 00:04:03,724
It's most important

65
00:04:03,932 --> 00:04:06,457
Wonderful,I haven't seen such an
agreement in a movie also

66
00:04:06,668 --> 00:04:09,865
I can't meet Sapna,I can't even
write a letter to her

67
00:04:10,638 --> 00:04:13,505
If,I send her an
empty envelope

68
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:14,935
Then,what can happen?

69
00:04:20,415 --> 00:04:22,076
Your love is very sincere

70
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,809
Love makes the world beautiful

71
00:04:48,142 --> 00:04:50,110
Hey,what's all this?

72
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,214
You had rubbed off
only one name

73
00:04:54,482 --> 00:04:56,950
See how many more have
appeared

74
00:04:57,619 --> 00:04:58,916
What to do now,mother

75
00:05:00,021 --> 00:05:01,249
Darling!

76
00:05:01,456 --> 00:05:02,354
Daddy has seen

77
00:05:04,526 --> 00:05:05,288
Shameless!

78
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,226
My forehead is blank,write
on that too

79
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:16,531
Dear sir

80
00:05:17,438 --> 00:05:18,234
I drink

81
00:05:19,107 --> 00:05:21,598
You all know & the entire
Town knows

82
00:05:22,343 --> 00:05:24,743
But,I've a unique way
of drinking

83
00:05:25,613 --> 00:05:27,945
Before 9 'o' clock I drink
as much as I can

84
00:05:28,182 --> 00:05:30,650
But exactly at 9 'o' clock
my party gets over

85
00:05:31,286 --> 00:05:35,586
It's neither at 8.59
nor at 8.61

86
00:05:36,324 --> 00:05:38,224
9 'o' clock means exactly
9 'o' clock

87
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,192
I don't compromise on
this matter

88
00:05:41,596 --> 00:05:43,723
This fact,you & the entire
city knows

89
00:05:47,735 --> 00:05:51,000
Hey,Samba.. Oh Samba brother
- What is this?

90
00:05:51,205 --> 00:05:54,038
Till now neither the glasses nor
the heads have broken

91
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:56,409
Why has the party not
bloomed till now?

92
00:06:13,494 --> 00:06:15,553
He is simple and an
innocent boy

93
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:20,694
Oh! meet Mr. Ram Singh
he also stays in Goa

94
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:21,797
I see!

95
00:06:22,103 --> 00:06:23,127
Where do you stay in Goa?

96
00:06:23,404 --> 00:06:25,895
Panaji,near palm beach
light house

97
00:06:26,207 --> 00:06:29,040
So cheers to our simpleton
friend

98
00:06:54,035 --> 00:06:55,332
Have you come for the party?

99
00:06:55,837 --> 00:06:58,305
No,I've escaped from
the party

100
00:07:00,975 --> 00:07:02,840
Have you also escaped from
the party?

101
00:07:05,847 --> 00:07:07,576
Mr. Danny is my elder brother

102
00:07:09,817 --> 00:07:11,284
In Mr. Hari's company,I'm...

103
00:07:13,988 --> 00:07:16,320
I'm the new employee
in his company

104
00:07:19,594 --> 00:07:20,686
My name is Vasu

105
00:07:22,997 --> 00:07:23,759
Please sit down

106
00:07:30,838 --> 00:07:31,896
My name is Vasu

107
00:07:39,514 --> 00:07:42,176
Why are you telling your name
again and again?

108
00:07:42,784 --> 00:07:44,775
So that you tell me
your name

109
00:07:48,523 --> 00:07:49,615
My name is Sandhya

110
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:52,225
Your name is very 'ACHHI' (Nice)

111
00:07:52,894 --> 00:07:56,830
Achhi (Nice) not Achhi
but Achha (Nice)

112
00:07:57,365 --> 00:07:59,128
Nice! Nice!

113
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:02,825
I don't know Hindi properly,that's why
I make grammatical mistakes

114
00:08:04,372 --> 00:08:05,669
Where do you come from?

115
00:08:05,873 --> 00:08:07,966
I'm a Tamilian and Tamil is
my Mother tongue

116
00:08:10,378 --> 00:08:11,276
Okay,tell me...

117
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:13,379
Why the swimming pool is
like this?"TANNl EllAME"

118
00:08:18,953 --> 00:08:21,148
Some people have similar
lives

119
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:24,483
Like this pool... empty

120
00:08:25,593 --> 00:08:29,529
I know only two words of Tamil
Greeting and Food

121
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,796
I was in Madras for a week
with my husband

122
00:08:35,069 --> 00:08:37,230
Oh! are you married?

123
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:38,728
Yes

124
00:08:39,507 --> 00:08:42,442
It was performed & it
has also ended

125
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:44,203
In air...

126
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,781
My husband died in an
air crash

127
00:08:58,126 --> 00:09:00,560
When a person starts life...

128
00:09:01,262 --> 00:09:02,229
He forgets

129
00:09:02,897 --> 00:09:04,660
That death is not very far

130
00:09:05,566 --> 00:09:07,261
Whenever the lotuses of
happiness bloom

131
00:09:07,602 --> 00:09:10,196
Usually they bloom in the
lake of tears

132
00:09:10,838 --> 00:09:12,100
These are God's divine
plays

133
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,500
God gives smiles and also tears

134
00:09:19,547 --> 00:09:21,242
Your Hindi is very sweet

135
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:23,448
Hindi is really sweet

136
00:09:26,888 --> 00:09:27,445
Sweet...

137
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,984
Will you teach me Hindi?

138
00:09:33,227 --> 00:09:34,489
Oh! so many names

139
00:09:35,062 --> 00:09:36,996
How many will they be?

140
00:09:38,466 --> 00:09:42,129
May be in thousands! because
Vasu is one among thousands

141
00:09:42,603 --> 00:09:45,731
Madam,Vasu is one among thousands
I agree

142
00:09:45,973 --> 00:09:51,468
But among these thousands you can
accord second place to me!Isn't it

143
00:09:52,013 --> 00:09:52,672
Meaning?

144
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,904
I request you!

145
00:09:54,215 --> 00:09:57,582
Look there! I've written my
name just once

146
00:09:58,052 --> 00:10:00,077
With so much of love Chakram

147
00:10:01,322 --> 00:10:05,281
Please don't erase that or else
all my desires will be erased

148
00:10:06,561 --> 00:10:08,688
After one year,If Vasu doesn't
come,then...

149
00:10:08,896 --> 00:10:10,158
No,no just in case

150
00:10:10,898 --> 00:10:14,095
Then,atleast you can give some
thought to my name

151
00:10:25,346 --> 00:10:26,643
Forgive me Sapna

152
00:10:27,415 --> 00:10:29,383
I lost my balance in my
over enthusiasm

153
00:10:30,484 --> 00:10:31,917
Now I promise

154
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:33,511
For your love

155
00:10:34,055 --> 00:10:36,114
I'll definitely culminate
that agreement

156
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:41,826
I'm leaving this city
but Sapna..

157
00:11:02,183 --> 00:11:03,912
Are you real mother or
step mother?

158
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:06,812
Step mother will not worry
about your welfare

159
00:11:07,421 --> 00:11:11,357
I'm your real mother,I can even
kill you for your welfare

160
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:13,927
If your madness continues
like this...

161
00:11:14,295 --> 00:11:16,263
Then,I'll kill you with my
own hands,got it

162
00:11:16,631 --> 00:11:19,759
You can kill me but you can't
erase my memories

163
00:11:20,635 --> 00:11:21,761
They are not in your
hands

164
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:26,437
Where are you going?

165
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:30,772
Why? Will you also come
with me?

166
00:11:31,646 --> 00:11:34,945
Where ever my heart
& memories will go

167
00:11:35,983 --> 00:11:38,611
Can you go every where
come

168
00:11:45,660 --> 00:12:00,132
Let the ocean & all the
rivers try

169
00:12:00,508 --> 00:12:06,469
Love can't be subdued

170
00:12:07,014 --> 00:12:14,147
Every spark gets extinguished

171
00:12:16,023 --> 00:12:21,984
Vasu,what happened.. please
tell me,what happened?

172
00:12:42,717 --> 00:12:46,676
You naughty,rascal...

173
00:12:47,722 --> 00:12:51,852
Hey,where are you running away?
- Do sit ups

174
00:13:23,591 --> 00:13:38,905
Salutations to the
sweet sixteen

175
00:13:39,106 --> 00:13:44,908
Salutations to the first sight
of love

176
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:52,412
Salutations to the first sight
of love,salutations

177
00:13:54,955 --> 00:14:05,763
The first one in the world who
kindled love in this heart

178
00:14:06,634 --> 00:14:17,602
Salutations to first sweet heart
of the world

179
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:24,782
Thanks to the paths shown
by love

180
00:14:24,985 --> 00:14:30,446
Salutations to the path which
reaches the heart

181
00:15:17,204 --> 00:15:22,665
The place where this maiden got
calumniated

182
00:15:28,716 --> 00:15:34,518
Salutations to that Town,that Street
& that House

183
00:15:35,055 --> 00:15:40,516
The one who united us &
separated us

184
00:15:40,728 --> 00:15:46,360
Salutations to that Time,to that Moment
& to that Chime

185
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:27,401
We were meeting here
it is written here

186
00:16:27,608 --> 00:16:33,240
Salutations to this Writings &
it's Punctuations

187
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:40,410
On the sands of shore,where the
heart quavered like this

188
00:16:40,788 --> 00:16:46,249
Salutations to every Wave which
swelled in the sea

189
00:16:48,128 --> 00:16:53,760
In the depths of the enchanting
lake of the eyes

190
00:16:53,968 --> 00:16:59,429
Salutations to that Whirlpool
which drowned us

191
00:16:59,807 --> 00:17:05,939
Defying the veil,the thing
that slipped away

192
00:17:06,146 --> 00:17:11,778
Salutations to that Green wicked
upper cloth

193
00:17:12,152 --> 00:17:23,120
The enemies of love tried
their best

194
00:17:23,497 --> 00:17:28,958
Salutations to the Look which
wasn't deterred

195
00:18:21,555 --> 00:18:24,023
When 2 of us meet

196
00:18:24,892 --> 00:18:25,358
Both

197
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,187
When both of us will meet

198
00:18:28,562 --> 00:18:29,859
Both
- Yes both

199
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,690
When both of us will meet

200
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,696
Yes,then

201
00:18:34,234 --> 00:18:36,862
We'll make a new history

202
00:18:37,237 --> 00:18:39,034
M- A-K-E

203
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,866
Create will be better
Isn't it?

204
00:18:42,242 --> 00:18:43,869
Not only better,but
beautiful

205
00:18:45,913 --> 00:18:48,040
C- R-E-A-T-E

206
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,377
And,if we don't meet,then...?

207
00:18:54,088 --> 00:18:56,556
And,if we are not able to
meet,then...?

208
00:18:56,924 --> 00:18:58,050
No... no...

209
00:18:58,592 --> 00:19:02,050
And,if we are not able to meet,then
.. yeah-Yes

210
00:19:02,262 --> 00:19:05,060
If we are not able to meet,then
- Yes,further

211
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,069
Even then,we'll create a
new history

212
00:19:09,603 --> 00:19:14,404
Wonderful! Even then we'll
create a new history

213
00:19:21,615 --> 00:19:22,081
Listen Postman

214
00:19:23,283 --> 00:19:24,910
The letter which you gave that
house,where did it come from?

215
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:26,416
I don't know
- Is it from Hyderabad?

216
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,746
I told you,I don't know

217
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,417
What kind of a Postman is he?
he does not know anything

218
00:19:39,633 --> 00:19:42,261
Daughter,in the morning,you
were asking the Postman -

219
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,268
Yes,this is Vasu's letter only!
he is alright

220
00:19:45,639 --> 00:19:47,266
Job is also good,and
in Hyderabad...

221
00:19:47,474 --> 00:19:47,940
Enough... Enough...

222
00:19:48,142 --> 00:19:50,770
It's in Hindi,see
- I don't want to see anything

223
00:19:50,978 --> 00:19:53,446
I know that you'll only
talk about Vasu-

224
00:19:53,647 --> 00:19:56,445
And put the blame on me
I've broken the agreement

225
00:19:57,151 --> 00:19:59,949
I beg of you! I don't want to
know about Vasu

226
00:20:00,154 --> 00:20:03,954
Nor about Hyderabad
nor about his job

227
00:20:04,491 --> 00:20:06,959
For God sake,in future
don't meet me

228
00:20:07,161 --> 00:20:09,959
Don't see me & don't
talk to me also

229
00:20:15,335 --> 00:20:17,303
Hello,Mr. Hari,are you fine?

230
00:20:17,504 --> 00:20:20,132
Come.. come the devotee of
Lord Hanuman!

231
00:20:21,175 --> 00:20:21,971
How are you?

232
00:20:22,342 --> 00:20:23,468
Nothing new about me!

233
00:20:32,686 --> 00:20:34,813
Neither wife nor that and
nor concubine

234
00:20:36,857 --> 00:20:37,983
How is my son?

235
00:20:39,026 --> 00:20:39,993
How is Sapna?

236
00:20:42,696 --> 00:20:45,324
Did you see Mr. Hari,he's
asking straight away

237
00:20:45,532 --> 00:20:46,328
How is Sapna?

238
00:20:46,867 --> 00:20:48,334
He didn't even ask
how is mother?

239
00:20:49,536 --> 00:20:52,004
Okay,how is mother?
- Enough!

240
00:20:52,372 --> 00:20:53,669
Now tell me,how is Sapna?

241
00:20:53,874 --> 00:20:55,000
She is like a Pumpkin

242
00:20:55,542 --> 00:20:56,839
Mr. Hari,did you see his
mentality?

243
00:20:58,212 --> 00:21:01,010
I don't want anything
but I wish that-

244
00:21:01,215 --> 00:21:04,013
He should forget Sapna completely

245
00:21:04,718 --> 00:21:06,845
One girl is staying in
this city

246
00:21:07,221 --> 00:21:08,347
She's from our Madras

247
00:21:08,722 --> 00:21:11,520
Caste and Race
matches perfectly

248
00:21:11,725 --> 00:21:16,025
I want that some how Vasu should
get married to her

249
00:21:16,897 --> 00:21:19,866
Mr. Shivaram,caste and Race
are now outdated

250
00:21:20,234 --> 00:21:21,360
This is modern time

251
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:24,367
First love and later on
marriage

252
00:21:24,571 --> 00:21:24,866
But...

253
00:21:25,739 --> 00:21:27,366
We'll play a game
- What?

254
00:21:27,574 --> 00:21:29,542
In this Love story,we'll
change the girl

255
00:21:30,244 --> 00:21:30,869
How come?...

256
00:21:31,245 --> 00:21:34,544
I'll appoint that girl as a typist
in my office

257
00:21:35,082 --> 00:21:36,049
Then? -Then what?

258
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:41,376
Their eyes will meet and
they'll fall in love

259
00:21:41,755 --> 00:21:43,723
Then...?- Love marriage

260
00:21:44,591 --> 00:21:47,560
Then?... but how is it possible?

261
00:21:47,761 --> 00:21:48,887
What is the guarantee?

262
00:21:49,263 --> 00:21:51,731
What guarantee? I've seen
many such cases...

263
00:21:51,932 --> 00:21:53,058
It's a small matter

264
00:21:53,267 --> 00:21:54,734
Is it a small matter?- Yes

265
00:21:54,935 --> 00:21:56,732
What's the name of the girl?

266
00:21:57,604 --> 00:21:58,070
Tulasi

267
00:21:58,438 --> 00:22:01,566
What's your age?-
Equal to Actress Hellen?

268
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,908
Zeenataman?.. Teenamuneem?

269
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,747
Who are they?

270
00:22:07,948 --> 00:22:10,576
Oh! My god!don't you
watch Hindi movies?

271
00:22:10,951 --> 00:22:13,078
I watch only Tamil films

272
00:22:13,287 --> 00:22:14,254
Only Tamil movies?

273
00:22:17,624 --> 00:22:19,421
Have you seen a Tamil movie
"Kadhalika Neramilai"

274
00:22:20,294 --> 00:22:20,919
So,you've seen

275
00:22:23,463 --> 00:22:24,930
What's the meaning of
that title?

276
00:22:25,465 --> 00:22:26,932
There is no time to love

277
00:22:27,134 --> 00:22:28,761
Here,you'll get lot of time!

278
00:22:49,823 --> 00:22:52,121
Oh! No.. Aunty,what are
you burning?

279
00:23:03,337 --> 00:23:07,637
Come.. come,your father laid a bet
that this photo can't be burnt

280
00:23:08,175 --> 00:23:09,142
I'm proving that it can
be burnt

281
00:23:09,676 --> 00:23:12,304
But,Mr. Professor,when did you
indulge in the dirty bet

282
00:23:12,512 --> 00:23:13,308
Stop blabbering!

283
00:23:29,363 --> 00:23:32,821
Atlast,I've won the bet

284
00:23:37,537 --> 00:23:38,504
Sir,your Tea

285
00:24:27,421 --> 00:24:28,217
Now,who has won?

286
00:24:40,434 --> 00:24:42,732
Oh! you are here?

287
00:24:45,605 --> 00:24:47,232
Swimming Pool which is filled
with water-

288
00:24:47,441 --> 00:24:49,909
Is pleasant to look at
Isn't it?- Yes

289
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:52,745
I wanted to ask you
Something

290
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,247
Do you know,how to dance?

291
00:24:56,116 --> 00:24:58,084
Before,I used to dance
but not now

292
00:24:58,285 --> 00:24:58,580
Why?

293
00:25:01,788 --> 00:25:03,255
Everything has got over
with him

294
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,916
But,why did you ask?

295
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:07,593
I thought you can teach
me dance-Yes?

296
00:25:07,794 --> 00:25:09,762
Why?Am I not fit for it?

297
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,097
Yes! why not?

298
00:25:11,631 --> 00:25:13,599
But,why do you want to
learn this?

299
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,598
I want to tire myself so much
by this practice

300
00:25:16,803 --> 00:25:18,270
So,that the storm inside me
may mitigate

301
00:25:19,139 --> 00:25:21,937
Oh! you want to meditate
- No,I want to forget

302
00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:23,434
Will you teach me?

303
00:25:23,643 --> 00:25:26,111
Why not?but it will be
very experience

304
00:25:27,814 --> 00:25:30,282
Fees for Teacher
- We'll talk about it later

305
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:31,617
Then,what now?

306
00:25:31,985 --> 00:25:36,115
First,you've to touch
Teacher's feet

307
00:25:37,824 --> 00:25:38,449
Bless me!

308
00:26:35,415 --> 00:26:40,512
When we both come together

309
00:26:40,887 --> 00:26:50,853
When we both come together
we'll create a new History

310
00:26:51,231 --> 00:26:55,861
Even,if we both don't
come together

311
00:26:56,403 --> 00:27:06,540
Even,if we both don't come together
we'll create a new history,even then

312
00:27:24,598 --> 00:27:30,230
How many people had loved
in this world?

313
00:27:32,105 --> 00:27:38,408
Don't know how many,lover's blood
had this world sucked?

314
00:27:39,112 --> 00:27:44,414
Why doesn't the thirsty sword stop?
why doesn't it's thirst gets subside?

315
00:27:44,618 --> 00:27:48,577
We'll subside this world's
thirst!

316
00:27:54,794 --> 00:27:59,595
We'll create a New History!

317
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:42,473
My heart is agitated
all night!

318
00:28:43,677 --> 00:28:52,142
When the heartless world
tells us...

319
00:28:52,686 --> 00:28:57,487
How many names are there in the books
who had been restricted to meet?

320
00:28:57,691 --> 00:29:02,492
Why should we enter our names
in that list?

321
00:29:07,701 --> 00:29:12,331
We'll create a new History!

322
00:30:26,112 --> 00:30:27,739
Cholera in Hyderabad!

323
00:30:42,629 --> 00:30:44,756
Let him die with cholera
and die a Dog's death

324
00:30:50,637 --> 00:30:52,605
"Are you fine"?

325
00:30:57,143 --> 00:31:00,442
Whenever you meet me,you'll always
ask me,"Are you fine"?

326
00:31:01,314 --> 00:31:02,110
What does it mean?

327
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:05,449
Means... are you fine?

328
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,137
Her highness!

329
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,137
Why're you sitting alone here?

330
00:31:29,242 --> 00:31:31,301
Sir,will you do a favour
to me?

331
00:31:31,578 --> 00:31:32,135
Order me!

332
00:31:32,579 --> 00:31:34,979
I've written Vasu's name all over
my room's wall,Isn't it?

333
00:31:35,181 --> 00:31:35,476
Yes... Yes!

334
00:31:35,682 --> 00:31:37,980
Can you count them and tell me
how many Vasu's are there?

335
00:31:38,184 --> 00:31:39,151
Immediately!

336
00:31:46,526 --> 00:31:48,653
I'm fine!

337
00:31:51,531 --> 00:31:53,658
I'm fine!

338
00:31:57,203 --> 00:32:03,506
72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 78, 79, 80...
81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86...

339
00:32:08,748 --> 00:32:09,339
Where did I leave it?

340
00:32:14,721 --> 00:32:15,847
Surprise,Seethuram

341
00:32:16,156 --> 00:32:17,851
When ever I want to send you
on an inspection

342
00:32:18,091 --> 00:32:19,524
It'll always be invariably your
mother's death Anniversary

343
00:32:19,726 --> 00:32:21,523
I want to ask you,how many
mother's do you've?

344
00:32:22,896 --> 00:32:25,524
Why have you become a deaf like
Sanjeev Kumar of film'Koshish'?

345
00:32:25,732 --> 00:32:26,198
Come on tell!

346
00:32:26,733 --> 00:32:29,031
Last time it wasn't my mother's,it was
my grandma's Death Anniversary

347
00:32:29,235 --> 00:32:31,203
Grandma's Death Anniversary?

348
00:32:32,172 --> 00:32:35,869
Whose will it be next time?
your's?... Mine?... Whose?

349
00:32:36,109 --> 00:32:37,041
Come on tell

350
00:32:38,244 --> 00:32:41,042
I had arranged everything for
your Mangalore trip

351
00:32:41,247 --> 00:32:43,215
Whom shall I send at
this last minute?

352
00:32:44,751 --> 00:32:46,218
Did you see the film?

353
00:32:46,753 --> 00:32:49,381
Sir,if you permit,shall
I go?

354
00:32:49,656 --> 00:32:51,214
What do you know about
this work?

355
00:32:51,591 --> 00:32:52,558
I'll leave,Sir!

356
00:32:52,792 --> 00:32:55,386
Alright! do you want to
help Seethuram?

357
00:32:55,762 --> 00:32:59,061
No sir,it'll be a great help
for myself

358
00:32:59,432 --> 00:33:01,400
Someone has to go there
you can go!

359
00:33:47,647 --> 00:33:49,274
Who's car is that one
with stickers?

360
00:33:51,251 --> 00:33:53,446
Oh! that Hazel,H belongs
to Chakravarthi

361
00:33:53,853 --> 00:33:56,947
He has come from Goa,he had
enquired about students group

362
00:33:57,156 --> 00:33:57,952
.. And took up a room in
this Hotel only

363
00:34:27,186 --> 00:34:28,312
Have you come here to
spy on me?

364
00:34:28,855 --> 00:34:32,655
You don't get angry my highness
it was Aunty's order to watch over you

365
00:34:32,892 --> 00:34:34,484
She doesn't have any faith
on you,Isn't it?

366
00:34:34,761 --> 00:34:37,321
When she doesn't have faith on me
why didn't she stop me there itself?

367
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:40,499
Does she consider,am I so shameless
to elope with anyone at midnight?

368
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,497
No.. No..! No.. No!

369
00:34:43,703 --> 00:34:46,331
I've not come alone,I've come with
100 fellow students!

370
00:34:46,539 --> 00:34:48,837
So many girl students,Teachers
have come with me

371
00:34:49,242 --> 00:34:51,506
What'll they think about me,if
they see you spying me?

372
00:34:51,711 --> 00:34:56,842
You don't worry,my highness! neither
I'll chase you nor I'll watch you

373
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,343
It was aunty's order
that I had to...

374
00:35:00,386 --> 00:35:01,353
After all,she's my
mother-in-law

375
00:35:01,554 --> 00:35:02,179
Mother-in-law?

376
00:35:02,722 --> 00:35:03,689
If the agreement breaks down...

377
00:35:31,584 --> 00:35:34,382
If her highness permits me
shall I go for a bath?

378
00:36:14,327 --> 00:36:34,477
What is this strange,bond that
we share between us?

379
00:36:35,148 --> 00:36:41,451
It's neither known to me
nor known to you

380
00:37:33,372 --> 00:37:46,183
One string pulls and the second
comes running!

381
00:37:46,886 --> 00:37:53,018
It'll come tied by the pull
of brittle strings

382
00:37:53,726 --> 00:38:03,692
Like... like a mad lover!

383
00:38:10,576 --> 00:38:16,879
It's neither known to me
nor known to you

384
00:39:01,794 --> 00:39:08,097
Neither I'm getting sleep
nor peace

385
00:39:15,474 --> 00:39:21,435
Even after a Herculian effort
I'm unable to stop it

386
00:39:22,048 --> 00:39:31,946
...You are coming into
my dreams

387
00:39:38,831 --> 00:39:44,792
It's neither known to me
nor known to you

388
00:40:17,803 --> 00:40:18,269
Where did she go away?

389
00:40:30,916 --> 00:40:32,645
Are you a Tourist guide?

390
00:40:33,619 --> 00:40:34,347
Where's Sapna?

391
00:40:34,754 --> 00:40:36,278
She has gone out

392
00:40:38,057 --> 00:40:38,785
Who are you?

393
00:40:39,525 --> 00:40:41,288
Me?... I'm her husband

394
00:40:42,428 --> 00:40:43,053
Husband?

395
00:40:43,596 --> 00:40:44,460
Almost!

396
00:40:45,965 --> 00:40:46,863
I mean would-be husband

397
00:40:48,868 --> 00:40:51,735
I thought,before I get married,I
shall get trained in family life

398
00:41:15,461 --> 00:41:17,554
Sapna has gone with her would-be
husband in car

399
00:41:17,763 --> 00:41:20,061
Both would enjoy their
journey back

400
00:41:21,834 --> 00:41:24,428
Let them enjoy,both are going
to be husband & wife

401
00:41:24,637 --> 00:41:26,434
Let them do anything,how're
we concerned with it?

402
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:27,828
Who are you?

403
00:42:00,973 --> 00:42:02,463
When did you come back
from Mangalore?

404
00:42:05,478 --> 00:42:06,467
What happened to you?

405
00:42:08,647 --> 00:42:09,579
...Say something

406
00:42:12,585 --> 00:42:13,483
...Let it play on

407
00:43:53,319 --> 00:43:55,048
You're dancing like a
typhoon?

408
00:43:55,254 --> 00:43:56,312
What happened to you?

409
00:43:59,124 --> 00:44:02,457
I don't want to get drowned in
tears,that's why!

410
00:44:03,629 --> 00:44:05,859
I was in such a deep
trance of sleep

411
00:44:06,365 --> 00:44:09,232
...That even,if my eye was pierced
by thorn,I wouldn't have realised it

412
00:44:10,936 --> 00:44:13,666
But now,I've come out of
the trance

413
00:44:14,206 --> 00:44:18,233
And the truth has come infront of me
in it's true disposing form

414
00:44:19,678 --> 00:44:22,374
You always tried to hide
a pain from me

415
00:44:22,615 --> 00:44:27,382
Even when it tried to come out
you always stopped it in throat

416
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,978
Can't you share your pain
with me?

417
00:44:33,893 --> 00:44:35,861
This is not pain..
it's poison

418
00:44:36,161 --> 00:44:39,528
Neither can I swallow it
nor spit it out

419
00:44:40,366 --> 00:44:44,302
In front,till my vision sees
I find only sea of darkness

420
00:44:44,503 --> 00:44:45,902
Sandhya,I feel,I may get
drowned in it

421
00:44:51,343 --> 00:44:53,038
I need a companion

422
00:45:00,786 --> 00:45:02,720
I never saw you in such
a condition

423
00:45:03,522 --> 00:45:06,719
Your eyes are burning like
Embers

424
00:45:07,159 --> 00:45:10,686
Not just eyes,my entire body
is burning

425
00:45:10,896 --> 00:45:12,830
My soul is also burning

426
00:45:13,999 --> 00:45:18,732
I need such a cool shadow... under which
I can forget all my memories

427
00:45:19,338 --> 00:45:20,862
All my memories

428
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,968
Why can't you be that
shadow?

429
00:45:46,899 --> 00:45:49,333
I'm Siramakrishnan speaking
how are you?

430
00:45:49,902 --> 00:45:51,335
Is my son there?

431
00:45:51,537 --> 00:45:56,565
No,it's 6 P.M now,everyone has left
the office,I'm alone in the office

432
00:45:56,942 --> 00:45:58,705
I've some personal work

433
00:45:59,645 --> 00:46:03,046
How's Thulasi,have they started
meeting or not?

434
00:46:03,248 --> 00:46:08,481
You're talking about meeting,she
has stuck,such that

435
00:46:08,687 --> 00:46:11,986
If sensor people see it,they'll
cut them for obscene

436
00:46:14,226 --> 00:46:16,956
Very good.. very good
how are you?

437
00:46:17,162 --> 00:46:21,360
What could be sensational for me?neither
wife nor concubine or any woman

438
00:46:33,545 --> 00:46:34,876
Do you love him?

439
00:46:42,187 --> 00:46:44,621
Do you want to marry him?

440
00:46:46,592 --> 00:46:48,082
Come on tell

441
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:52,118
If you permit me
by saying Yes to it

442
00:46:54,967 --> 00:46:59,700
How eagerly I was waiting
to hear this Yes from you?

443
00:47:02,674 --> 00:47:05,142
If you settle again in life
with this marriage

444
00:47:06,045 --> 00:47:09,481
There Isn't any happiness which
is bigger than this for me

445
00:47:22,094 --> 00:47:27,498
Sandhya,come whatever may,your
marriage will take place

446
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,624
...Definitely it'll...

447
00:47:47,019 --> 00:47:49,283
You?... In Hyderabad?

448
00:47:50,622 --> 00:47:52,817
I've a book stall in this
Exhibition

449
00:47:53,492 --> 00:47:55,653
Do you want to know
who is she?

450
00:47:56,395 --> 00:47:57,953
She's my future wife

451
00:47:59,031 --> 00:48:02,228
Go and tell in Goa,that
I too can marry

452
00:48:10,476 --> 00:48:12,103
Time?... Yes

453
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:14,907
I met him in Hyderabad

454
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,678
And he introduced me to his
future wife also

455
00:48:17,883 --> 00:48:18,850
She's from Hyderabad

456
00:48:19,751 --> 00:48:24,552
What a great beauty?!what a
youthfulness? what an eyes?

457
00:48:24,756 --> 00:48:29,420
What great style,what great lips
what great colours?

458
00:48:46,111 --> 00:48:48,545
Oh! Sapna! Is it you?...
come.. come..

459
00:48:50,415 --> 00:48:51,473
How are you,my child?

460
00:48:52,484 --> 00:48:54,281
I've come to ask you about
an important matter?

461
00:48:55,187 --> 00:48:57,519
First time,you've come to our house
just wait for a minute

462
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:06,598
Child,have this sweet

463
00:49:07,566 --> 00:49:09,625
Is it for Vasu's
Engagement?

464
00:49:09,835 --> 00:49:10,494
What did you say?

465
00:49:10,702 --> 00:49:12,533
Vasu is marrying some one else
Isn't it?

466
00:49:12,738 --> 00:49:13,466
Who said that?

467
00:49:13,705 --> 00:49:14,467
Come on tell

468
00:49:14,806 --> 00:49:16,034
Is it true or not?

469
00:49:16,375 --> 00:49:17,535
This can't be true

470
00:49:17,743 --> 00:49:20,109
Without intimating us,how
can Vasu marry?

471
00:49:20,479 --> 00:49:21,844
Then what I had heard
just now?

472
00:49:22,114 --> 00:49:22,944
It's a lie

473
00:49:23,148 --> 00:49:25,673
That's not a lie! you're lying

474
00:49:26,051 --> 00:49:27,518
...For your son's love

475
00:49:27,653 --> 00:49:29,917
You've gone mad in love

476
00:49:30,122 --> 00:49:32,682
Did you understand my son
only this much?

477
00:49:33,058 --> 00:49:35,390
Vasu will renege his promise

478
00:49:36,094 --> 00:49:41,657
No.. no.. I've known Vasu since his
birth,are you teaching me about him?

479
00:49:42,134 --> 00:49:44,034
Yuck! go away,you mad girl

480
00:49:52,811 --> 00:49:55,871
You seem to be a man of
great conduct

481
00:49:56,481 --> 00:50:01,009
I didn't know that you too have the
habit of keeping false promises

482
00:50:01,553 --> 00:50:06,547
An experienced woman could
manage very well

483
00:50:06,992 --> 00:50:09,893
Are you marrying that widow
with these ideas?

484
00:50:15,634 --> 00:50:19,126
I don't know,what do you men
see in a woman?

485
00:50:19,371 --> 00:50:21,430
That you're ready to die
immediately

486
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:24,632
Is there any custom & tradition
for it or not?

487
00:50:24,843 --> 00:50:29,644
A big house... large eyes.. If one has
large front & back enough

488
00:50:29,848 --> 00:50:30,746
...Is it enough?

489
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:34,681
But,Baby! I've not seen anything
big in you

490
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:36,612
Except,your big dirty mouth

491
00:50:46,498 --> 00:50:48,762
Did Vasu give you an
invitation or not?

492
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:55,863
Unable to understand... what's that
big in you?

493
00:50:56,108 --> 00:50:57,837
Which Vasu likes in you!

494
00:50:59,077 --> 00:51:00,942
Except that big vermillion

495
00:52:26,798 --> 00:52:28,732
You're Sapna,Isn't it?
- Yes and you

496
00:52:28,934 --> 00:52:29,958
I've something to discuss
with you

497
00:52:30,168 --> 00:52:32,762
It's time for my college
mother is inside,you may meet her

498
00:52:34,072 --> 00:52:36,802
My name is Sandhya!- Is it
- I've come from Hyderabad

499
00:52:37,709 --> 00:52:38,733
I'm Vaus's friend

500
00:52:46,785 --> 00:52:47,615
Come in

501
00:52:47,986 --> 00:52:48,918
What about your college?

502
00:52:50,055 --> 00:52:51,522
Today,it's leave

503
00:52:59,965 --> 00:53:03,696
Come Vasu,do something helpful
for your marriage arrangements?

504
00:53:04,102 --> 00:53:05,228
Write atleast addresses
on these cards?

505
00:53:06,972 --> 00:53:07,836
Isn't Sandhya there?

506
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:08,801
She has gone out of station

507
00:53:09,541 --> 00:53:11,702
To personally invite her friends
for the marriage

508
00:53:12,144 --> 00:53:15,113
Can't they be invited by post?

509
00:53:15,313 --> 00:53:16,610
It's a normal practice now!

510
00:53:18,483 --> 00:53:19,108
Come in!

511
00:53:36,001 --> 00:53:36,626
Please sit down!

512
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:43,637
Who wrote all this?

513
00:53:44,009 --> 00:53:44,634
It's me!

514
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:48,638
It was mother's order not to
utter even Vasu's name

515
00:53:50,015 --> 00:53:51,141
For that order...

516
00:53:52,017 --> 00:53:53,143
...This was my reply!

517
00:53:54,519 --> 00:53:57,818
Mother is the biggest hurdle
in our love

518
00:53:58,523 --> 00:53:58,818
Yes!

519
00:54:00,525 --> 00:54:01,992
Vasu told me everything

520
00:54:03,862 --> 00:54:08,993
Did Vasu tell you everything?

521
00:54:09,367 --> 00:54:11,835
If he hadn't told me
how could I know all this?

522
00:54:12,537 --> 00:54:15,995
Whenever we meet,it's always
about you,we discuss

523
00:54:22,714 --> 00:54:25,683
Are you both so close?

524
00:54:26,051 --> 00:54:26,346
Yes!

525
00:54:30,555 --> 00:54:33,524
So,close... that you both touch
each other also?

526
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:37,358
Whenever we meet
we shake hands!

527
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,537
How is my Vasu?

528
00:54:51,243 --> 00:54:53,211
This is 30th time,you're
asking this!

529
00:54:53,578 --> 00:54:57,036
Don't count!I'll ask
millions of times

530
00:54:57,916 --> 00:54:59,042
How's Vasu?

531
00:55:00,585 --> 00:55:04,544
Our agreement will not break,Isn't it
If I ask like that?

532
00:55:17,602 --> 00:55:20,901
Poor man!he Isn't a bad man
but he's a simpleton

533
00:55:21,106 --> 00:55:24,906
He has come from Lucknow with a
fond hope that I'll marry him

534
00:55:25,277 --> 00:55:26,744
If the agreement fails

535
00:55:27,612 --> 00:55:29,580
This agreement will never fail

536
00:55:32,117 --> 00:55:32,742
Look at her!

537
00:55:34,286 --> 00:55:35,253
...Hey!...

538
00:55:40,125 --> 00:55:40,921
Is she Vasu's mother?

539
00:55:41,293 --> 00:55:41,759
No!

540
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:43,427
My mother-in-law!

541
00:55:44,029 --> 00:55:46,589
Sapna,I'm going back by
tonight's flight

542
00:55:46,798 --> 00:55:47,765
So early?

543
00:55:47,966 --> 00:55:50,594
The work for which I'm here
is over

544
00:55:50,802 --> 00:55:51,598
What work?

545
00:55:52,971 --> 00:55:53,767
Do you want me to tell
the truth?

546
00:55:53,972 --> 00:55:54,597
Definitely!

547
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,767
I had come to decide about
my marriage

548
00:55:57,976 --> 00:55:59,773
What did you decide?

549
00:56:01,646 --> 00:56:04,615
Oh! this is Coffee!I had
ordered for Tea

550
00:56:06,318 --> 00:56:09,446
May be my cup of coffee
has come to you

551
00:56:16,828 --> 00:56:18,455
...I didn't defile your
cup of Coffee

552
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:36,147
When did you come back?

553
00:56:36,514 --> 00:56:37,139
This morning!

554
00:56:40,852 --> 00:56:42,319
You didn't even inform me
before going!

555
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:54,999
Got the Ticket?have you sent it?
alright

556
00:56:58,536 --> 00:57:00,003
Do you want to go to
office early?

557
00:57:00,372 --> 00:57:00,838
No!

558
00:57:01,206 --> 00:57:02,833
But,why did you call me
so urgently?

559
00:57:03,041 --> 00:57:05,839
Madam,a flight Ticket,that travel agent
brought & gave it

560
00:57:06,211 --> 00:57:06,677
Alright!

561
00:57:07,045 --> 00:57:09,343
Abdullah! what's the date
today?

562
00:57:09,547 --> 00:57:10,343
18 December!

563
00:57:10,548 --> 00:57:11,344
And year?

564
00:57:11,716 --> 00:57:13,183
Madam?- Come on tell

565
00:57:13,551 --> 00:57:14,677
1979!

566
00:57:15,887 --> 00:57:17,684
Isn't it 18th December 1979!?!

567
00:57:17,889 --> 00:57:19,686
Now,you can go,look here

568
00:57:20,058 --> 00:57:20,683
What are they?

569
00:57:20,892 --> 00:57:23,190
They're marriage Invitations
I'm going to post them

570
00:57:23,395 --> 00:57:25,022
Not necessary!- Go!

571
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:34,037
I'm unable to understand anything

572
00:57:34,239 --> 00:57:36,207
Your silence is making
me go mad

573
00:57:49,587 --> 00:57:58,552
We are made for each other

574
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:09,565
Understood!

575
00:58:14,279 --> 00:58:16,577
Oh alright! then,you went to
go to Goa,Isn't it?

576
00:58:19,617 --> 00:58:22,916
Alright! did you meet Sapna?

577
00:58:24,622 --> 00:58:25,589
Yes,I did meet her!

578
00:58:27,792 --> 00:58:32,092
Oh! that's why,this new behaviour
this new style

579
00:58:34,632 --> 00:58:35,599
What did Sapna tell you?

580
00:58:36,301 --> 00:58:37,928
Sapna told me everything!

581
00:58:39,804 --> 00:58:41,101
About your love...

582
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:43,437
About those places...

583
00:58:44,309 --> 00:58:47,107
.. Where you both used to roam around
with hands on each other's shoulders

584
00:58:47,812 --> 00:58:49,279
She told about those
day's matters

585
00:58:49,981 --> 00:58:53,439
.. Which used to come after
a long time of interval

586
00:58:53,818 --> 00:58:55,285
.. But used to get over
very quickly

587
00:58:55,987 --> 00:58:58,285
And about your long
live agreement

588
00:58:58,656 --> 00:59:00,624
...It's big clauses!

589
00:59:04,496 --> 00:59:06,293
Sapna has told me
everything

590
00:59:09,334 --> 00:59:09,959
Is it so?

591
00:59:11,336 --> 00:59:13,463
Didn't she tell about
her marriage?

592
00:59:14,172 --> 00:59:19,974
Before the agreement could end
she's marrying a rich Bastard

593
00:59:21,846 --> 00:59:23,473
If I had the rights,which I
had on you till yesterday

594
00:59:23,848 --> 00:59:27,807
I would've slapped you for
uttering such dirty words

595
00:59:28,686 --> 00:59:31,985
You met same Tom,Dick & Harry
did you believe whatever said by him?

596
00:59:33,024 --> 00:59:34,992
The man you met in Manglore...

597
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:36,986
He likes Sapana.

598
00:59:37,362 --> 00:59:38,829
But,Sapana doesn't like him.

599
00:59:42,867 --> 00:59:44,664
There is a big difference
like earth & sky!

600
00:59:45,203 --> 00:59:47,000
The difference between
Sapna and you

601
00:59:47,872 --> 00:59:49,840
Sapna Isn't weak minded
like you.

602
00:59:50,875 --> 00:59:52,843
She never forgot you even
for a moment.

603
00:59:53,378 --> 00:59:57,678
She's counting every day,every
minute,waiting for you.

604
00:59:58,883 --> 01:00:00,009
You just tell me only
this much!

605
01:00:00,885 --> 01:00:02,682
When is your agreement
going to elapse?

606
01:00:03,388 --> 01:00:05,356
When are you both going
to meet again?

607
01:00:06,891 --> 01:00:07,357
Come on tell!

608
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:11,358
19th December 1979.

609
01:00:11,896 --> 01:00:12,863
That means... tomorrow?

610
01:00:14,065 --> 01:00:18,695
Waiting for this day,her eyes
have developed wounds!

611
01:00:19,404 --> 01:00:21,531
How easily you could
forget her?

612
01:00:21,906 --> 01:00:23,874
And were about to marry me?

613
01:00:24,242 --> 01:00:27,211
It seems you had once jumped into the
river on a request from Sapna!

614
01:00:27,579 --> 01:00:29,547
Is it to leave her in the
middle of the stream?

615
01:00:30,415 --> 01:00:34,374
You know that!

616
01:00:35,253 --> 01:00:39,053
When I get angry,I lose
my senses

617
01:00:40,925 --> 01:00:42,051
This is my weakness

618
01:00:43,928 --> 01:00:45,896
But neither such thing ever
occurred in my life!

619
01:00:46,097 --> 01:00:48,725
Nor my anger has ever
let me down

620
01:00:50,101 --> 01:00:51,728
Whatever I heard in Manglore
on that day!

621
01:00:51,936 --> 01:00:55,235
It didn't even have proper means
to clarify it with Sapna

622
01:00:55,607 --> 01:00:57,234
What was the necessity
to clarify?

623
01:00:57,609 --> 01:01:00,077
Couldn't you wait till the
lapsing of the agreement?

624
01:01:00,445 --> 01:01:01,742
Is that all your care?

625
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,578
If your heart get's shaken so
much for trivial matters...

626
01:01:04,949 --> 01:01:08,908
Neither you've any right to
love nor be loved

627
01:01:10,121 --> 01:01:14,251
Now,you only tell me,what
am I do?

628
01:01:16,794 --> 01:01:18,091
You want me to tell you
even that

629
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,598
Take this Ticket to Goa
you leave immediately

630
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,107
After so much has happened

631
01:01:31,809 --> 01:01:32,605
...Thank God

632
01:01:33,478 --> 01:01:35,605
Before that could happen,this
had happened

633
01:01:36,648 --> 01:01:39,947
That's why,I stopped posting of
wedding Invitations also

634
01:01:53,164 --> 01:01:58,124
Me?.. I'll remain myself

635
01:01:59,837 --> 01:02:01,134
My loneliness

636
01:02:02,006 --> 01:02:03,473
...They were with me
earlier also

637
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:06,477
Now also,they'll be with
me only

638
01:02:08,846 --> 01:02:10,643
Nobody will lose anything

639
01:02:14,018 --> 01:02:14,985
If true love wins

640
01:02:16,521 --> 01:02:17,488
What more can I ask?

641
01:02:19,023 --> 01:02:22,652
But,leaving a Goddess
like you...

642
01:02:23,861 --> 01:02:25,988
Will Sapna forgive me
for this?

643
01:02:26,531 --> 01:02:30,661
Only if Sapna had known
all this?

644
01:02:34,205 --> 01:02:35,672
Didn't you tell anything
to Sapna?

645
01:02:45,717 --> 01:02:52,680
You've become so great,that I can't
look into your eyes & talk

646
01:02:56,728 --> 01:02:58,855
Alright!where's sir?

647
01:03:00,064 --> 01:03:02,532
No need to talk with my
brother regarding me

648
01:03:03,568 --> 01:03:05,695
But,Sandhya,how can I
... No..

649
01:03:06,404 --> 01:03:09,703
My marriage will not take place
with you,I'm saying it myself

650
01:03:10,908 --> 01:03:13,206
Go,Vasu,it's your time
for your flight

651
01:03:14,245 --> 01:03:15,041
Remember it

652
01:03:15,913 --> 01:03:19,041
If you don't go today,you'll never be
able to meet Sapna again

653
01:03:20,084 --> 01:03:23,053
Sapna(dream) will remain a
distant dream for you

654
01:03:24,255 --> 01:03:24,880
Go!

655
01:03:26,924 --> 01:03:32,385
I don't know,why,but,I feel even now
I may not be able to meet Sapna

656
01:03:34,599 --> 01:03:39,229
Just tell me only this much,what
did she say before you came back?

657
01:03:40,104 --> 01:03:40,900
Before I came!

658
01:03:44,442 --> 01:03:45,909
First,she kissed me here

659
01:03:46,778 --> 01:03:47,745
...That was for me

660
01:03:48,946 --> 01:03:49,571
Then,here...

661
01:03:50,782 --> 01:03:51,749
...That was for you

662
01:05:02,854 --> 01:05:04,981
What happened to the Red vermellion
on your head?

663
01:05:07,525 --> 01:05:11,154
Fate cried so much,that it got
washed away in it's tears

664
01:05:11,529 --> 01:05:13,827
Then,whatever I had heard
was true?

665
01:05:19,704 --> 01:05:22,673
He has gone away!and you
didn't even tell me

666
01:05:25,543 --> 01:05:29,001
Even if,I told you,could you've
changed my fate's path?

667
01:05:30,214 --> 01:05:30,680
Brother!

668
01:05:32,216 --> 01:05:38,519
Today,once again,it has been proved that
family life,Isn't written in my fate

669
01:05:54,071 --> 01:05:55,698
Yes... yes,he has cheated and
escaped from here

670
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,208
He's reaching Panjim by
morning flight

671
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:01,208
I've heard,that he's coming
there to meet some girl

672
01:06:01,913 --> 01:06:04,882
Come whatever may,don't allow
them to meet

673
01:06:05,583 --> 01:06:07,380
Break his hands...
break his legs

674
01:06:08,085 --> 01:06:09,882
If possible,do away with
his life also

675
01:06:10,087 --> 01:06:11,054
Mr. Belli

676
01:06:11,589 --> 01:06:15,218
Every drop of whisky,that's flowing
in my veins

677
01:06:15,426 --> 01:06:16,893
They're always loyal to you

678
01:06:17,428 --> 01:06:19,726
Can I ever forget your favours?

679
01:06:20,097 --> 01:06:24,397
Cheating my sister here,and enjoying
with some other girl there

680
01:06:30,107 --> 01:06:30,732
Understood?

681
01:06:32,276 --> 01:06:34,403
Take it,as your job is done

682
01:06:39,951 --> 01:06:41,077
Today,you got up very early?

683
01:06:41,452 --> 01:06:42,749
I'm waiting for the Sun

684
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:43,745
Why?

685
01:06:44,121 --> 01:06:45,088
Is it Solar Eclipse today?

686
01:06:45,957 --> 01:06:47,925
It was Eclipsed all the
365 days

687
01:06:48,459 --> 01:06:50,256
And I couldn't forget
even a day

688
01:06:51,128 --> 01:06:53,096
It was a year long of
one dark night

689
01:06:53,798 --> 01:06:55,265
But,today the Eclipse
has got over

690
01:06:55,967 --> 01:06:58,765
Today's Sun will come
with my life

691
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:00,095
...With my Vasu

692
01:07:00,471 --> 01:07:02,598
Even I too wish,that your
Vasu must return

693
01:07:03,808 --> 01:07:05,605
But,God's record is there
till now

694
01:07:06,143 --> 01:07:08,611
He has always been ruthless
with True lovers

695
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:13,439
That's why!I'm still with
a hope

696
01:07:14,318 --> 01:07:14,943
No... NO...

697
01:07:15,653 --> 01:07:17,120
...My number will always be
second

698
01:07:18,155 --> 01:07:19,122
First is he...

699
01:07:20,658 --> 01:07:21,784
Look,Sun has come

700
01:07:23,661 --> 01:07:25,288
Your Vasu will also
definitely come

701
01:07:27,331 --> 01:07:32,291
I whole heartedly wish,that you both
should live happily forever

702
01:07:36,507 --> 01:07:37,974
Has the marriage date
been changed?

703
01:07:40,177 --> 01:07:41,144
Who told you?

704
01:07:42,847 --> 01:07:43,814
Senior Boss,was saying...

705
01:07:44,849 --> 01:07:45,315
With whom?

706
01:07:46,517 --> 01:07:48,644
He was talking on phone with
Goa's Ram Singh

707
01:07:50,688 --> 01:07:53,816
He was very angry
... and also over drunk

708
01:07:54,692 --> 01:07:59,152
I came to know this also...
he was ordering to kill Vasu

709
01:08:04,368 --> 01:08:09,328
No Sandhya!I'm not so heartless
to take anyone's life

710
01:08:10,875 --> 01:08:13,673
Last night,in that inebriated mood
don't know,what I told him

711
01:08:15,379 --> 01:08:18,177
Could I tell him to take
Vasu's life?

712
01:08:18,549 --> 01:08:20,016
You're a drunkard

713
01:08:21,218 --> 01:08:25,177
In your drinking binge,you'll not
know what you're doing...

714
01:08:25,389 --> 01:08:26,356
And what you're blabbering?

715
01:08:28,726 --> 01:08:31,194
Don't know,which beast wakes
up in you at that time?

716
01:08:32,063 --> 01:08:33,189
And the man in you sleeps

717
01:08:40,071 --> 01:08:41,197
What's Goa's Ram Sing's
phone number?

718
01:08:43,074 --> 01:08:44,701
He has left home early
morning itself

719
01:08:45,409 --> 01:08:46,535
It seems,he has left home...

720
01:08:47,078 --> 01:08:48,545
Tell me,what are we
supposed to do now?

721
01:08:49,413 --> 01:08:51,881
Look,we've to talk with him
regarding a very important matter

722
01:08:52,083 --> 01:08:53,209
Is there any way that I can get
in touch with him?

723
01:08:53,584 --> 01:08:54,551
Or could you send him
a message?

724
01:08:55,252 --> 01:08:56,549
Do you know anything about
his whereabouts?

725
01:08:57,088 --> 01:08:58,214
All I know is,once he
leaves home...

726
01:08:58,589 --> 01:09:03,049
Even Police can't search
& find him

727
01:09:03,594 --> 01:09:07,052
Can you give your neighbour
Mr. Sivaram's phone number?

728
01:09:07,431 --> 01:09:09,558
How can they've phone
at home?

729
01:09:09,934 --> 01:09:11,902
You may've at least his office
phone number?

730
01:09:12,937 --> 01:09:13,733
I don't know

731
01:09:13,938 --> 01:09:15,405
This really is a bad thing

732
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:17,908
Vasu has left for home
from here

733
01:09:18,776 --> 01:09:21,074
But... but...

734
01:09:21,612 --> 01:09:23,239
His life is in danger

735
01:09:23,781 --> 01:09:24,577
Oh!God!

736
01:09:24,782 --> 01:09:25,248
Yes!

737
01:09:26,117 --> 01:09:26,742
I've understood

738
01:09:27,118 --> 01:09:28,915
No need to plead so much!

739
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,418
This is my duty,I'll personally
go & inform them

740
01:09:32,123 --> 01:09:33,249
You don't worry

741
01:09:33,791 --> 01:09:34,587
Who's Telephone was it?

742
01:09:37,962 --> 01:09:41,090
Stop... stop... stop...
enough...

743
01:09:44,135 --> 01:09:45,261
Take this.
- Sir, I don't have change.

744
01:09:45,469 --> 01:09:46,265
Keep it with you

745
01:09:51,642 --> 01:09:52,438
Vasu has come

746
01:09:53,811 --> 01:09:54,436
Vasu has come

747
01:09:57,648 --> 01:10:00,776
Hey!Mr. Sivaram!your son is coming
where are you going away?

748
01:10:01,152 --> 01:10:02,119
...I know it!

749
01:10:02,653 --> 01:10:03,449
...Why don't you keep quiet
for sometime?

750
01:10:06,157 --> 01:10:08,125
Son,what's this,you've become
so thin in one year?

751
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:09,626
Greetings!

752
01:10:09,827 --> 01:10:10,623
Wait!I'll get some coffee
for you

753
01:10:11,162 --> 01:10:13,960
Greetings!son... greetings
are you fine?

754
01:10:14,498 --> 01:10:16,466
First,I'll greet you by
folding my both hands

755
01:10:17,001 --> 01:10:19,299
Then,I'll ask,how's your
health keeping now a days?

756
01:10:20,171 --> 01:10:21,297
Please sit,sir!

757
01:10:22,339 --> 01:10:26,799
Wow!Great son!you've started
speaking chaste Hindi

758
01:10:27,344 --> 01:10:28,140
Where's father?

759
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:29,805
He has gone inside

760
01:10:31,849 --> 01:10:33,146
How did you come to
know about it?

761
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:35,648
May be,he's feeling embarassed
to show his face to me

762
01:10:37,354 --> 01:10:38,321
Leave it!I'll be back
in a minute

763
01:10:39,190 --> 01:10:39,656
Alright!... alright!

764
01:10:54,205 --> 01:10:55,832
Vasu,where's he?

765
01:10:56,207 --> 01:10:59,506
Are you both father & son
playing hide & seek?

766
01:10:59,710 --> 01:11:03,009
No,I thought of giving him sweets
as soon as he comes in

767
01:11:03,547 --> 01:11:07,347
Greetings mother-in-law
how are you?

768
01:11:08,385 --> 01:11:10,182
Why're you looking at me like
that?I'm Vasu

769
01:11:10,888 --> 01:11:13,356
The barrier of time which you
had built,its over now

770
01:11:13,724 --> 01:11:15,191
I've come to marry your
daughter

771
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:18,358
But,I don't find any receiptions
for your son-in-law

772
01:11:18,562 --> 01:11:19,358
Isn't there any grand welcome
for me?

773
01:11:23,234 --> 01:11:24,360
I seek your blessings
Mr. Professor

774
01:11:25,069 --> 01:11:26,195
How's your health?

775
01:11:26,737 --> 01:11:27,704
Let my health go to hell

776
01:11:28,405 --> 01:11:31,203
First,tell me,how could you learn
such good Hindi?

777
01:11:31,742 --> 01:11:32,868
Firing like a stengun

778
01:11:33,577 --> 01:11:36,375
It was Mother-in-law's wish, isn't it?
That I must learn Hindi

779
01:11:36,747 --> 01:11:39,045
Come on tell me,which region's
Hindi shall I talk?

780
01:11:40,251 --> 01:11:41,377
Delhi's slang?

781
01:11:42,419 --> 01:11:44,046
Meerut-Moradabadi slang?

782
01:11:44,922 --> 01:11:46,549
Mathura-Brindavan's Brij slang?

783
01:11:46,757 --> 01:11:49,885
Ayodhya's Awadhi?Bihar's Bhojpuri?
or Punjab's Punjabi

784
01:11:51,428 --> 01:11:54,727
Oh!My handsome,my butter sweet
How are you?

785
01:11:55,599 --> 01:11:57,726
Say something!Oh!uncle
open your mouth

786
01:11:59,436 --> 01:12:00,733
Uncle,Isn't it Punjabi?

787
01:12:04,775 --> 01:12:07,403
Mister!why're you staring
at me like this?

788
01:12:08,112 --> 01:12:12,071
Go inside and inform the bride
that Groom has arrived outside...

789
01:12:12,449 --> 01:12:14,076
...To marry her

790
01:12:14,618 --> 01:12:15,744
1000/0 Urdu!

791
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:17,417
Great 1000/0 Urdu

792
01:12:21,959 --> 01:12:23,756
Get up,Mother-in-law,get up

793
01:12:24,628 --> 01:12:26,596
A heart is beneath your leg!

794
01:12:27,965 --> 01:12:29,933
It'll be a kind consideration

795
01:12:30,467 --> 01:12:31,263
This is Lucknow Urdu

796
01:12:31,802 --> 01:12:32,598
Greetings... greetings!

797
01:12:34,305 --> 01:12:37,604
Hey!fool!what are you
hearing?

798
01:12:38,809 --> 01:12:41,277
Won't you go inside and
call my Bride?

799
01:12:42,479 --> 01:12:44,947
Oh!My God!even we too don't
know such a slang

800
01:12:45,649 --> 01:12:46,445
Which region's language?

801
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:47,116
Avadh!

802
01:12:49,653 --> 01:12:52,121
Still,you're standing here
come,go away from here

803
01:12:55,659 --> 01:12:56,455
...Bombay's local slang

804
01:12:59,496 --> 01:13:04,297
Mother-in-law!you've become
so thin

805
01:13:05,336 --> 01:13:06,633
Is it yearning for me?

806
01:13:07,671 --> 01:13:09,798
Wood will burn and become
Charcoal

807
01:13:10,007 --> 01:13:11,634
Charcoal will burn and
become ash

808
01:13:12,009 --> 01:13:15,137
I got so much burnt that neither
there was charcoal nor Ash

809
01:13:17,181 --> 01:13:21,140
Professor!Is it enough,or do you
want anymore Hindi?

810
01:13:22,186 --> 01:13:24,984
Enough of Hindi!Truely
enough of Hindi

811
01:13:25,522 --> 01:13:26,819
Firing like a stengun

812
01:13:27,024 --> 01:13:30,482
Professor,tell me only this
why Isn't Sapna seen till now?

813
01:13:31,028 --> 01:13:33,656
Is she getting dressed
up inside?

814
01:13:50,214 --> 01:13:52,512
But,you must agree
one thing,sir

815
01:13:53,050 --> 01:13:55,848
You're the best choice
for Sapna

816
01:13:56,387 --> 01:13:57,854
But,where's Sapna!

817
01:13:58,222 --> 01:13:59,348
Don't you know?
- No

818
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:00,515
I know!

819
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:04,857
Ask me!- Where?

820
01:14:11,235 --> 01:14:14,363
Isn't there your Love spot?
... near the Sea shore

821
01:14:15,072 --> 01:14:16,198
There's a mount near
the shore

822
01:14:16,573 --> 01:14:18,040
There's a temple on the
top of the mount

823
01:14:18,409 --> 01:14:19,205
And inside the Temple...

824
01:15:08,459 --> 01:15:10,586
After so many days,I've got
a chance

825
01:15:12,796 --> 01:15:14,263
God promise!I can't leave it

826
01:15:47,498 --> 01:15:48,465
No... No...

827
01:16:57,234 --> 01:16:59,702
No... leave me... leave me...

828
01:17:21,258 --> 01:17:22,225
Leave me!

829
01:17:25,095 --> 01:17:25,720
No!

830
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:30,725
No!

831
01:19:05,862 --> 01:19:07,830
Police?... Run... Run...

832
01:20:29,446 --> 01:20:33,576
What happened to you,Vasu?
... You're in such a bad shape...

833
01:20:35,118 --> 01:20:40,249
This is price of our Love
and our meeting

834
01:20:43,627 --> 01:20:47,256
I feel,that the entire world
has become our enemy

835
01:20:52,469 --> 01:20:54,437
What happened to you,Sapna?

836
01:20:55,305 --> 01:21:01,767
.. My Love,My body...
My chastity...

837
01:21:02,312 --> 01:21:04,280
Considering all three
as your property...

838
01:21:04,481 --> 01:21:05,778
...How safely I had gaurded
it for you?

839
01:21:06,983 --> 01:21:10,441
But,you've come at such a time
when,I'm about to die...

840
01:21:11,655 --> 01:21:17,457
I'm also holding the last few
breaths only for you

841
01:21:18,161 --> 01:21:19,458
...Just to meet you

842
01:21:20,997 --> 01:21:22,965
Come on tell me,what happened?

843
01:21:23,166 --> 01:21:24,133
Yes... yes!

844
01:21:26,002 --> 01:21:30,462
My entire pain,all my tears
that's inside my eyes

845
01:21:31,007 --> 01:21:33,134
Some how, I wished, it
reaches you

846
01:21:39,349 --> 01:21:41,977
You're disappearing from
my eyes

847
01:21:42,519 --> 01:21:43,315
No!

848
01:21:43,687 --> 01:21:46,656
My eyes are getting closed.
I'm dying!...

849
01:21:47,023 --> 01:21:49,992
No... Vasu... No!
Don't leave me and go away!

850
01:21:50,694 --> 01:21:56,326
Did we both separate from each other to
meet like this in the embrace of death?

851
01:21:58,535 --> 01:22:01,333
Before death engulfs me
somehow take me away with you

852
01:22:01,872 --> 01:22:03,339
Take me away with you

853
01:22:05,876 --> 01:22:06,843
Come Sapna!

854
01:23:27,791 --> 01:23:29,588
Love's Language is different

855
01:23:30,794 --> 01:23:32,091
One who loses in it...

856
01:23:32,796 --> 01:23:34,263
...They say he has won!

857
01:23:35,465 --> 01:23:38,764
And one who wins in it...
they say he has lost

858
01:23:40,303 --> 01:23:42,430
Those who win in this,marry

859
01:23:43,306 --> 01:23:47,106
And those who lose,give their
lives for one another

860
01:23:47,644 --> 01:23:49,441
And become Immortal!
