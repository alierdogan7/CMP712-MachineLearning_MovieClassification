1
00:00:56,709 --> 00:01:02,545
There once was a queen who gave birth
to such a deformed son...

2
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:07,305
that people long doubted whether
he could even be human.

3
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:10,381
The queen felt so horribly sorry
for her son...

4
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:15,543
that she banned him to
the far and barren forest of Hocus-Pocus.

5
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:20,066
For years and years the monster
lived there, hidden and lonely.

6
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:26,384
Until a nuclear missile from deep within
the Earth turned his life upside down.

7
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:33,022
This missile had in its womb
thousands of hoods, full of life.

8
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:37,387
The first to reach surface
was more beautiful than anything else.

9
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:42,748
The monster saw in the appearance
a sign sent from the gods.

10
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:45,628
And the slaughter began.

11
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:49,065
Many girls died in his claws.

12
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:53,939
Until one day, one of the girls
escaped her horrible destiny.

13
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:59,979
And this is how the legend of the old
lady with the bad legs...

14
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:40,908
Monster...

15
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:35,941
Many years have passed since
the monster died.

16
00:05:37,989 --> 00:05:41,186
And haunted by her
memories of dancing...

17
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:47,060
the old lady dreamed of stealing
the last hood's legs.

18
00:06:02,109 --> 00:06:05,897
This is the insanity of everyday.
So I'm telling life:

19
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:09,220
I love you, life!
-I feel rotten.

20
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:13,382
And I want to burn myself
-Tease with my fingers,

21
00:06:13,549 --> 00:06:16,109
smiling,

22
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:18,737
my ears in the wind.

23
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:21,469
Speaking with my teeth,

24
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:25,463
And I, I want to make my
body shiver.

25
00:06:36,869 --> 00:06:40,862
Come push the button and
the hood will come out.

26
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:42,747
Do it.

27
00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:49,388
She's sleeping for years
-deep below the earth

28
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:27,424
Hey, come on. Push the button
and wake up that hood.

29
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:18,782
I don't want to be done yet...

30
00:08:18,989 --> 00:08:22,140
where everything is hidden away.

31
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:25,107
I was dying of boredom

32
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:28,579
in thousand-and-one nights

33
00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:31,980
and thinking of him

34
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:34,743
i can only say to boredom:

35
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:37,901
if only he was here again,
if only it was nice again,

36
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:41,459
shed some light into my night,

37
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:44,189
then there will only be warmth

38
00:08:44,349 --> 00:08:47,386
in my heart.

39
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:50,461
No more here and there

40
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:53,666
only dum de dum.

41
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:56,980
And my little boy

42
00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:00,505
only gets pretty flowers

43
00:09:00,669 --> 00:09:03,058
a bunch of birds,

44
00:09:03,229 --> 00:09:06,699
and my eyes in his mouth

45
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:23,581
crazy about my boy,

46
00:09:23,749 --> 00:09:27,105
crazy from here to there,

47
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:30,067
crazy for life.

48
00:09:30,229 --> 00:09:33,460
I'm telling my heart

49
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:36,462
that to die in your arms

50
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:39,462
wouldn't be so bad.

51
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:42,860
That's why I wish you were here again,

52
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:45,941
that's all I'm asking for.

53
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:58,987
Go touch.

54
00:10:11,349 --> 00:10:13,021
Touch.

55
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,740
Her skin...

56
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,547
so soft...

57
00:10:26,989 --> 00:10:28,900
sweet...

58
00:10:32,189 --> 00:10:36,228
Her mouth, her eyes...

59
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:50,460
We are...

60
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:55,627
alone in the world.

61
00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:17,821
Go to sleep, go to sleep.

62
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:20,819
Go to sleep, little girl.

63
00:11:20,989 --> 00:11:26,017
Turn around and follow me
onto the road of happiness.

64
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:30,101
Go to sleep my little lamb.

65
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:33,818
Onto the Hocus-Pocus-Trail.

66
00:11:33,989 --> 00:11:36,867
Come with me, come with me.

67
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:43,468
You're all
messed up.

68
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:48,020
Go to sleep, sleep...

69
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:58,940
Such long stilts.

70
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:02,943
Lovely, beautiful.

71
00:12:03,109 --> 00:12:05,020
See you soon, girl.

72
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:09,102
Come here, little rabbit.

73
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:13,308
I'll squeeze you
until the last drop.

74
00:12:13,469 --> 00:12:17,587
Your blood will be my energy.

75
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:30,101
Those stilts are mine.
Just for me.

76
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:33,900
Just a little while and I
will dance again.

77
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:49,783
In my eyes I see

78
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:53,146
blue suns

79
00:12:53,869 --> 00:12:57,179
a trip sparkling with light

80
00:12:57,349 --> 00:13:00,307
from a glittering cosmos,

81
00:13:01,309 --> 00:13:05,222
I'm up in a thousand
kinds of smoke,

82
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:08,984
in bubbles of sparks,

83
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:12,903
A Hocus-Pocus-Garden.

84
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:20,548
Where mushrooms do the Polka,

85
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:31,618
in this spring I see...

86
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:35,577
the metaphorcerer's voice,

87
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:39,185
and suddenly my spirit

88
00:13:39,349 --> 00:13:42,978
leaves me diagonally

89
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:47,264
A Hocus-Pocus-Garden

90
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:55,024
where everything sways and swings.

91
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:51,108
All the blood...

92
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:31,621
Monster!

93
00:17:47,589 --> 00:17:52,868
Push the knob and the door
will open.

94
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:21,825
Time after time I see in you,

95
00:18:21,989 --> 00:18:24,901
alchemy in spring

96
00:18:25,069 --> 00:18:28,505
Time after time I read in you

97
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:31,627
shivers within,

98
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:40,546
but I read in these eyes

99
00:18:40,709 --> 00:18:44,019
I can't tell what, how
horrible the fire is.

100
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:47,465
The fire of despair

101
00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:50,587
And yet, and still

102
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:57,706
I feel in these fingers

103
00:18:57,869 --> 00:19:00,781
the feeling of my joy,

104
00:19:00,949 --> 00:19:03,747
I see in this arm

105
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:07,140
the wind of noise,

106
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:10,187
I see in this mouth

107
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:13,421
shy somethings,

108
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:19,945
and on this nose I see

109
00:19:20,109 --> 00:19:23,021
the scent of a kiss,

110
00:19:23,189 --> 00:19:25,862
I hear from this ear

111
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:29,226
the echo of a miracle,

112
00:19:33,189 --> 00:19:38,183
the sound of a night
that's gone, forever.

113
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:43,820
The sound of a night
that's gone forever,

114
00:19:46,149 --> 00:19:50,188
and the sound of he who burns
himself on poetry...

115
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:53,745
and comma, says: I love you.

116
00:19:54,949 --> 00:19:56,667
We are...

117
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,901
alone in the world.

118
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:14,017
What big eyes you have.

119
00:21:20,629 --> 00:21:22,347
That is...

120
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:28,539
That is too see you better, my child.

121
00:21:33,149 --> 00:21:36,221
What big hands you have.

122
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:47,105
That is to touch you better, my child.

123
00:21:48,949 --> 00:21:52,180
Why, what big...

124
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:55,497
teeth you have.
