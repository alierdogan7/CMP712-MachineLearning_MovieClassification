King Sokwe's message?

543
00:21:24,635 --> 00:21:26,557
Uh, yeah...

544
00:21:26,642 --> 00:21:27,838
Well, then?

545
00:21:27,924 --> 00:21:29,103
It's just...

546
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:31,299
Kion? I need the message.

547
00:21:31,471 --> 00:21:32,572
Are you sure?

548
00:21:32,627 --> 00:21:34,381
Yes! You have to give it to me!

549
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:35,603
Okay...

550
00:21:35,736 --> 00:21:37,463
<i>Kuishi ni kucheka!</i>

551
00:21:41,017 --> 00:21:42,287
(GRUNTS)

552
00:21:42,877 --> 00:21:44,135
Sorry, Your Majesty.

553
00:21:44,197 --> 00:21:45,697
It really wasn't my idea.

554
00:21:45,814 --> 00:21:48,161
(SING-SONG VOICE) This
might have been a mistake.

555
00:21:49,189 --> 00:21:50,557
(CHUCKLES)

556
00:21:50,689 --> 00:21:52,619
Oh, King Sokwe.

557
00:21:52,736 --> 00:21:55,705
No one delivers a peace
message like him.

558
00:21:56,345 --> 00:21:58,155
(ALL LAUGHING)
