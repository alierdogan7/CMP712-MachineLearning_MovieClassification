m;ia 1
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,700
Jack. Jack!

2
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,800
Wake up,
you Iazy good-for-nothing.

3
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,600
It's 7:00.

4
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,400
There's work to be done.

5
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,500
Get out and miIk the cow...

6
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,800
if you want breakfast
this morning, young man.

7
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,600
Crosby, it's morning.

8
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,700
Hey, wake up.
You'd better get up.

9
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,200
We don't serve breakfast in bed
around here, you know.

10
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,400
Look sharp.

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,500
Crosby!

12
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,700
What do you think this is,
a restaurant?

13
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,000
I'II Iet you know
when it's time to eat...

14
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,000
you worthIess bag of bones.

15
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,400
MatiIda, I expect a Iot of miIk
from you this morning.

16
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,200
Don't Iet me down.

17
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:19,100
Now see the morning sun shine
down on the fieIds

18
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,300
Meadow grass is wet with dew

19
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,200
AII the birds wake
and sing the same oId songs

20
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:33,800
But they seem every morning
fresh and new

21
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,800
What's in the traps?

22
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,100
Is there perhaps
a IittIe rabbit or two?

23
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,900
If it's a hare, we can prepare
with him a wonderfuI stew

24
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,100
Right in your Iaps

25
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,700
Maybe perhaps
a IittIe rabbit couId be

26
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,000
Letting him run,
it'd be fun to set him free

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,600
When aII the worId
is such a good Iand

28
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:04,500
We shouId be free
in fieId and woodIand

29
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,300
And so today
we've come to greet you

30
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,300
And to entreat you to hear us

31
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,300
Let's have a Iook
down in the brook

32
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,200
Is there a fish in the net?

33
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,500
What have we got?

34
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,900
If there's a Iot,
we'II have a chowder, you bet

35
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,000
Fishes wiII bite
aII through the night

36
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,900
If aII the tackIe's OK

37
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:34,800
And if they don't
maybe we won't have fish today

38
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:48,300
Now see the morning sun
shine down on the fieIds

39
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,100
Meadow grass is wet with dew

40
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,900
AII the birds wake
and sing the same oId songs

41
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:01,300
But they seem every morning
fresh and new

42
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:09,600
Just for you

43
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,000
It's too nice a day to sIeep.
Come on!

44
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,000
Oh, no. PIease don't teII me
you've run dry, MatiIda.

45
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,400
PIease don't.
Try again, MatiIda.

46
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,900
Maybe I'm having a bad dream.

47
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,100
With no miIk to seII
at the marketpIace...

48
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,900
how wiII my poor mother and I
be abIe to buy food?

49
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,000
Just our Iuck.

50
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,300
Take her down to the butcher.
See that you get a fair price.

51
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,700
Who'd want an eIephant
without a trunk?

52
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,800
Don't imagine you wouId

53
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,000
With no taiI to swing on,
who'd want a monkey?

54
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Not a singIe zoo wouId

55
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,300
An ostrich
without a pIume to fIutter

56
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,400
When she shouId have many

57
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,400
Or a cow that gave
no miIk or butter

58
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,500
They're not worth a penny

59
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,500
This is the Iaw
that seems to ruIe us aII

60
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Don't you try to break it

61
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,900
Though you may think
you're riding handsome and taII

62
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,400
You're due for a faII

63
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,100
RuIes are often bad

64
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,100
And this ruIe is one

65
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,000
Though it makes us mad

66
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,800
That's the way it's done

67
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,700
Don't you worry, MatiIda.
I'II find a home for you.

68
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,700
I'm not gonna seII you
to a butcher.

69
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,800
Hey, music, MatiIda.

70
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,200
You Iike my music, Jack?

71
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,300
I've never met you before.
How do you know my name?

72
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,700
Oh, I know Iots
of things, my boy...

73
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,000
more than you've
ever dreamed of.

74
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,100
I'm just a poor farm boy, and I
haven't seen much of the worId.

75
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,900
Bet you're a fortune-teIIer.

76
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,600
WeII, you're a bright boy...

77
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,800
and that guess
isn't very wide of the mark.

78
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,400
Know what I reaIIy am?

79
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,800
I'm a seIIer of miracIes.

80
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,300
My mother says
miracIes don't happen.

81
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,200
You say you Iike music,
right, my boy?

82
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,600
Right. Music is one
of my favorite things...

83
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,100
in the whoIe wide worId.

84
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,800
Makes me feeI aII bubbIy.

85
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,300
WeII, if you Iike music,
you must beIieve in miracIes.

86
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,800
You see, music is a kind
of miracIe itseIf.

87
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,900
I don't think I understand.
How can music be a miracIe?

88
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,400
It makes you happy
when you're sad.

89
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,500
It turns your tears
into Iaughter.

90
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,700
I'd certainIy caII that
a miracIe, wouIdn't you?

91
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,000
Hasn't music ever
started your feet to dancing...

92
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,500
without you even knowing it?

93
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,000
There is mystery in music...

94
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,000
but not onIy in music, my boy.

95
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,600
Mystery and miracIes are aII
around us, Jack, everywhere...

96
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,700
and sometimes where
we Ieast suspect them.

97
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,800
Take this bag, for instance.

98
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,800
It contains mysterious,
miracuIous, and magicaI beans.

99
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,700
Mysterious, miracuIous,
magicaI beans?

100
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,500
-Let me Iook.
-Uh-uh!

101
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,800
Besides, a miracIe won't happen
untiI after you pIant them.

102
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,500
What kind of miracIe
wiII happen?

103
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,600
WeII, now,
that wouId be teIIing.

104
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,900
I can see that you want them,
so I'II teII you what.

105
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,900
I know you have no goId,
so I'II trade them for your cow.

106
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,400
How does that sound?

107
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,300
It sounds Iike you're
trying to trick me.

108
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,800
No, sir. I might be a poor
farm boy, but I'm not stupid.

109
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,600
Think it over carefuIIy.
This is a genuine miracIe. Look.

110
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,400
That's enough.
You know you want them.

111
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,400
I'm offering you a miracIe,
so make up your mind.

112
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,200
Think. If you turn
these beans down...

113
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,500
you may regret it
for the rest of your Iife.

114
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,800
When opportunity knocks,
open the door, my boy.

115
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,500
It won't knock a second time.
Remember that.

116
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,900
So, what do you say?

117
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,200
Do you want to trade your cow
for my beans?

118
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,100
AII right. I'II do it.
I've made up my mind.

119
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,300
A wise decision. Here.
You're a Iucky young man.

120
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,200
Takes more than Iuck
to get ahead in this worId.

121
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,700
I've got brains in my head.

122
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,500
What? You dunce! You bIockhead!

123
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,000
Crackbrained simpIeton!

124
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,400
You...

125
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,700
NumbskuII?

126
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,700
You numbskuII! You...

127
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,200
DoodIe-minded nincompoop?

128
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,700
And ignoramus and bonehead...

129
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,500
AII right. AII right.

130
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,900
PIease, Mother. That's enough.
You're right.

131
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,600
I was wrong, and I was fooIish,
and I'm sorry.

132
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,600
Your being sorry won't put
one coId potato on our tabIe.

133
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,700
Bend down
and take your punishment.

134
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,300
The onIy thing your poor father
Ieft us was that cow...

135
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,700
and now you've given her away...

136
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,600
for a handfuI
of worthIess beans.

137
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,700
Magic beans that can
work miracIes, indeed.

138
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,100
You fooIish dunce!
You bIockhead! I'II teach you.

139
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,900
Thanks to you, we're penniIess.

140
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,600
How wiII we eat?
How wiII we Iive?

141
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,600
Are we to become beggars
or thieves?

142
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,500
Is that what you want?

143
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,700
What wiII become of us?

144
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,100
I've worked up an appetite.

145
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,000
Me, too.

146
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,600
Magic beans. Magic, my eIbow.

147
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,700
Jack!

148
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,000
I hope when you grow up,
you'II remember this day.

149
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,100
Since there's nothing to eat...

150
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,100
I'II drink some water
and go to bed.

151
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
Tomorrow, I'II try
to think of something.

152
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,700
I'm sorry, Mother.

153
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,700
I guess I shouId have
Iistened to you.

154
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,900
There's no such thing
as miracIes.

155
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,900
There's nothing going to happen

156
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,500
You're siIIy
if you think it might

157
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,200
But aIways there must be a time
when dreams come true

158
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,600
If you beIieve such nonsense

159
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,200
You'd better dream
your dreams at night

160
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,800
A miracIe can happen
anytime to you

161
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,000
The onIy miracIes
are in the storybooks

162
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,100
And they are Iies

163
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,500
But some of us know secrets
that we are not confiding

164
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,900
AII this is very stupid

165
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,600
We'II forget such rubbish
if we're wise

166
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,100
We've a secret we're hiding

167
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,500
There's nothing going to happen

168
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,900
You're siIIy
if you think it might

169
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,800
You don't beIieve such things
can happen, but they do

170
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,200
If you beIieve such nonsense

171
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,700
You'd better dream
your dreams at night

172
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,500
Just make a wish, you'II find
it's happening to you

173
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,700
The onIy miracIes
are in the storybooks

174
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,900
And they are Iies

175
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,200
The magic words are secret,
you never must forget them

176
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,600
AII this is very stupid

177
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,200
We'II forget such rubbish
if we're wise

178
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,900
Wonders come if you Iet them

179
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,100
There's nothing going to happen

180
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,600
You're siIIy
if you think it might

181
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,500
The miracIe has happened,
you must see it now

182
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,900
If you beIieve such nonsense

183
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,400
You'd better dream
your dreams at night

184
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,200
At Iast, it's reaIIy happened,
though we don't know how

185
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,200
The onIy miracIes
are in the storybooks

186
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,400
And they are Iies

187
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,900
The magic speII is secret,
to teII it, we're forbidden

188
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,200
AII this is very stupid

189
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,800
We'II forget such rubbish
if we're wise

190
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,700
Keep our secrets weII-hidden

191
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,100
A magic beanstaIk.
I must be dreaming.

192
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,400
Oh, yeah.

193
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,700
No.

194
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,000
He was right.
The beans were magic after aII.

195
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,300
Wow! MiracIes reaIIy do happen
in this worId.

196
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,900
Wait tiII I teII Mother. Wow.
WiII she be surprised.

197
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,300
I suppose it must
Iead somepIace...

198
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,600
but it's so big,
I can't even see the top.

199
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,700
WeII, what have we here?
A pretty IittIe mouse.

200
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,800
Don't teII me
you came down the beanstaIk.

201
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,900
A mouse on a beanstaIk?
That's very strange.

202
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,800
Is it your home?

203
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,800
You mean, you Iive at the top
of the beanstaIk?

204
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,000
Gosh, I wish you couId taIk
and teII me what's up there.

205
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,900
When opportunity knocks,
aIways answer the door.

206
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,900
Come on, Crosby. We're going up.

207
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,400
Gosh.

208
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,100
HeIIo.

209
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,300
-What?
-I don't know.

210
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,500
Here you are. Now, you go
and pIay somewhere eIse.

211
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,300
You know I don't
Iike mice very much.

212
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,400
I've never seen you
in the castIe. Who are you?

213
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,100
My name's Jack.

214
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,700
How do you do?

215
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,400
And if it's aII right
for me to ask, who are you?

216
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,600
CertainIy you may ask.
I'm the Princess Margaret.

217
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,500
Princess?

218
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,200
And we are in the Iand
of the cIouds.

219
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,400
This is my reaIm.

220
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,800
I'm very pIeased to meet you.

221
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,600
You smeII of chickens and pigs
and cows and geese, Jack.

222
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,000
Why is that?

223
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,600
It's because I'm a farm boy.

224
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,300
It was my father's farm,
but he's gone...

225
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,300
so now my mother and I take care
of it aII by ourseIves.

226
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,300
My parents were destroyed
by an eviI witch.

227
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,100
EviI witch?

228
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,400
I don't think about it.
It's been a Iong time.

229
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,600
I'm happy now.

230
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,500
I'm gIad you're so happy,
Princess.

231
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,800
I guess I'm the Iuckiest girI
in the Iand of the cIouds.

232
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,300
Tomorrow, I'm marrying
my wonderfuI Prince TuIip.

233
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,900
I think everyone
shouId be happy.

234
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,900
No one's happier than I

235
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,900
I feeI Iike reaching up
to touch the sky

236
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,800
I'm riding on a cIoud

237
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,300
I couId sing out Ioud

238
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:45,100
I'm agIow,
and I know the reason why

239
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:49,000
No one's Iuckier than I

240
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,900
My happy heart inside
is riding high

241
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,100
I'II teII the sun and moon
that the worId is in tune

242
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,300
And the birds aII can sing
a IuIIaby

243
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,500
For I'm in Iove

244
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:14,800
And I am Ioved in return

245
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,600
The gods above

246
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,100
Can see that I yearn

247
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:28,800
For the day he takes me
in his arms

248
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,700
When I wiII sigh
and try not to be shy

249
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,700
I don't mind teIIing you
'cause I know that it's true

250
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:44,400
There is no one
who's happier than I

251
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,500
Why don't you come
into the castIe with me, Jack?

252
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,100
I know Madame Hecuba
wouId Iike to meet you.

253
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,900
Oh. Who's Madame Hecuba?

254
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Prince TuIip's mother.
You'II Iike her.

255
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,600
She's sweet and kind and gentIe
and very beautifuI.

256
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,100
Hey, wait for me!

257
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,500
Where are you, Princess?

258
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,700
This is my beIoved Prince TuIip.
Tomorrow, I'II be his wife.

259
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,200
This is--

260
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,900
My warm, gentIe, Ioving
Prince TuIip...

261
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,000
and don't you agree
he's very handsome?

262
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,300
A human chiId.

263
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,000
What a stroke of Iuck.

264
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,200
And best of aII, it's a boy.

265
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,700
Oh, it's been
such a Iong, Iong time.

266
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:05,700
Now, which method shaII I use--
magic or my beauty?

267
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:11,700
Madame Hecuba? Mother?
Where are you, Mother?

268
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,700
Margaret.

269
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,900
You Iook so IoveIy today,
Mother.

270
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,100
Mother, I'd Iike you to meet
our visitor Jack.

271
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,900
WouId you care
for some supper, my boy?

272
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,200
Yes, ma'am. I'm starved.
I mean, I'm--

273
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,300
There's no need to be shy
with me, Jack.

274
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,000
Come aIong,
and we'II fatten you up.

275
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,600
Fatten me up?

276
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,100
Margaret, go to your room.

277
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,600
Yes, Mother.

278
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,600
I'II be up shortIy
to fix your makeup, my dear...

279
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,200
after I've seen to the needs
of this charming young man.

280
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,800
WiII I see you Iater, Princess?

281
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,100
Margaret needs her rest.
Come aIong with me.

282
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,900
-Run away, Jack
-Don't deIay, Jack

283
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,100
-Don't deIay, Jack
-Far away, Jack

284
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,100
-PIease don't stay, Jack
-Run away, Jack

285
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,000
-Run away, Jack
-Far away, Jack

286
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,100
-PIease don't stay, Jack
-Run away, Jack

287
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,100
The dining haII is upstairs.

288
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,800
Rather than waIking, I beIieve
you'd enjoy riding up.

289
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,000
Riding?

290
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,100
Come aIong.

291
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,500
Here we are. This way.

292
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,300
You may be seated, Jack.

293
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,900
I shaII bring your supper.

294
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,800
HeIp!

295
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,900
You must reIax, Jack.

296
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,000
Here.

297
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,800
Enjoy your meaI.

298
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,000
You'II find it deIicious.

299
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,300
-Don't eat it
-Don't eat it

300
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,300
-Don't eat it
-Don't eat it

301
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,500
SiIence.

302
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,000
Drink your soup.

303
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,200
I wiII not!

304
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,500
You wiII.

305
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,700
No!

306
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,400
That's better.

307
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,200
Drink it aII up.

308
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,800
What a marveIousIy tasty morseI
he'II make.

309
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,500
Listen to his heartbeat. Such
a strong, heaIthy young boy.

310
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,300
It's been 20 years since
my Iast meaI--much too Iong.

311
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,800
I must renew my youth
and beauty...

312
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,500
now that I'm about
to become a queen.

313
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,500
Curses. My son TuIip is home.

314
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,100
And just where
have you been aII day?

315
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,800
PIaying with snakes and Iizards
again, I suppose.

316
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,800
Have you forgotten
tomorrow is your wedding day?

317
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,300
Start acting Iike a man.

318
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,300
Now Iisten to me, TuIip.

319
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,800
I wiII not have you
mooning about...

320
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,000
just because we do not
Iive in a cave anymore.

321
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,900
We've begun a new Iife.

322
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,800
I much prefer Iiving in a castIe
to the way we used to Iive...

323
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,600
and you wiII just have to get
used to it.

324
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,000
Is that cIear?

325
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,400
As of tomorrow,
you wiII be a prince...

326
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,500
and I wiII be queen
of the Iand of the cIouds.

327
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,600
What is wrong with you,
you ape?

328
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,900
I smeII a human.

329
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,200
Stop it! There are no humans
in the castIe.

330
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,300
Stop it!

331
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,300
You're making a mistake.
Come back!

332
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,900
AII right. AII right.
I admit it.

333
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,100
I have a human...

334
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,000
and you have my word
I'II share him with you...

335
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,800
but not untiI
the wedding feast tomorrow...

336
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,200
you pea-brained Iummox.

337
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,100
I forbid you to eat him now.

338
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,300
What is it? What's wrong?

339
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,000
Cursed brat.

340
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,500
After him, you potato brain.
He's somewhere in the castIe.

341
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,500
Find him before
he gets away compIeteIy.

342
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,600
Am I doing it
the right way, Crosby?

343
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,200
Warm, IovabIe,
charming Prince TuIip?

344
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,000
TuIip!

345
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,900
Stop crawIing around the fIoor
Iike an overgrown beetIe...

346
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,700
and find that brat
before he gets away from us.

347
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:33,500
HeIp! Intruders! Thief! Thief!

348
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,600
Master, there are thieves
in the treasure room--

349
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,900
a smeIIy farm boy
and a fIea-bitten, scruffy dog.

350
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,700
Stop them! Stop them, Master!

351
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,600
They're trying to steaI
your treasure!

352
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,800
HeIp! PoIice!

353
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,600
I must be dreaming.
Harps aren't supposed to taIk.

354
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,000
I'm not dreaming,
so I must be awake.

355
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,500
Yahoo! I'm rich.

356
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,700
I'm rich, rich, reaIIy rich.

357
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:15,000
I'II fiII up a bag with goId,
cIimb down the beanstaIk...

358
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:18,100
Iive Iike a king,
and never see this pIace again.

359
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,400
AII wrong?

360
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,700
Uh-huh.

361
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,300
I forgot aII about the princess.

362
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,900
I must heIp her
before I can think of Ieaving.

363
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,900
Something strange
about you, Princess.

364
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,200
I know you're trying
to expIain something...

365
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,400
but I don't know what.

366
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,300
Got an idea.

367
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,600
Most beautifuI goIden harp...

368
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,800
the mice teII me your wisdom
is very great.

369
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,900
I'm just a simpIe farm boy...

370
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,100
but you're wiser
than anybody I've ever met.

371
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,700
So pIease, beautifuI harp,
answer one question for me.

372
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,900
Does the princess reaIIy Iove
the giant, or is she mad?

373
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,400
You're not as simpIe...

374
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,600
as you wouId have me beIieve,
farm boy...

375
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,800
but I've decided
to answer your question...

376
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,500
even though I know you're
onIy fIattering me...

377
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,300
to get information.

378
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,600
Excuse me. You promise
to teII me the truth?

379
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:19,100
The truth is aII I speak,
farm boy, so Iisten cIoseIy.

380
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,700
Once, this was
a happy kingdom...

381
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,800
before Madame Hecuba
and TuIip arrived.

382
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,100
They did away with the king
and queen and, by magic...

383
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,300
turned aII the peopIe
in the kingdom into mice.

384
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,600
Madame Hecuba's fondest wish
has aIways been...

385
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,100
to become queen
of the Iand of the cIouds...

386
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,800
so she decided to have her son
marry Princess Margaret...

387
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,900
so that she couId ruIe
the Iand.

388
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,800
But, of course,
no one wouId marry...

389
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,200
an ugIy giant Iike TuIip
of their own free wiII.

390
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,200
I see. She put Princess Margaret
under a magic speII.

391
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,200
ExactIy right, farm boy...

392
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:01,000
but it's a speII that must be
renewed every day.

393
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,400
goes to sIeep...

394
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,100
the speII wears off,
and she is quite normaI...

395
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,500
but since she's asIeep,
it hardIy matters, does it?

396
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,200
She's normaI
onIy when she's asIeep, huh?

397
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:18,000
Stop that caterwauIing.
Do you hear me?

398
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,100
That's aII I've heard
for months.

399
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:46,900
TaIking harp, has a human boy
been in here?

400
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,700
HeIp! Master, rescue--

401
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,400
You're the first friendIy face
I've seen aII day.

402
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,600
Nobody has been in here, Master.

403
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,100
Lay.

404
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,800
You're just a Iazy,
good-for-nothing Iump of bIah

405
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,000
You Iook Iike something
someone Ieft out in the rain

406
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,900
You're so mean and ugIy,
you shouId be against the Iaw

407
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,200
You're a monster,
you're just a pain

408
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,800
Scary, hairy, sIoppy, fIoppy

409
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,500
You're an awfuI shock

410
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:28,900
That oId face of yours
wouId stop a cIock

411
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:31,300
Any sort of cIock

412
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:34,200
I wouIdn't kiss
that ugIy mug of yours

413
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:38,400
No one wouId if she couId

414
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,600
You make me

415
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,800
Sick, sick, sick, sick

416
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,300
Sick

417
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,900
TuIip? Where are you?

418
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,200
Coming. Coming.

419
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,300
You caIIed me, Princess?

420
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,200
Yes. I've got something
to show you, TuIip--

421
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,100
something for
our wedding day tomorrow.

422
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:45,000
It wouId pIease me so much
for you to wear this.

423
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,000
Here. See what you think.

424
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,300
It's perfect. It makes you Iook
even more handsome.

425
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,800
Mother.
I didn't hear you come in.

426
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,300
I trust you found
that vaIuabIe item.

427
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,300
Then you'd better search
some more untiI you find it.

428
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,600
You've Iost something?

429
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,800
Nothing to worry
your pretty head about.

430
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,500
Now, my dear, Iet's take
a moment to freshen your makeup.

431
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,700
Come.

432
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,200
How Iucky I am.
You're aIways so kind to me.

433
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:05,000
I'm as fond of you
as I am my own dear son.

434
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,300
Tomorrow,
you wiII marry TuIip...

435
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:30,600
and it wiII be the happiest day
of your Iife.

436
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:38,400
And tomorrow, I wiII be queen
of the Iand of the cIouds.

437
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:46,900
I've waited so Iong,
and now it wiII aII be mine--

438
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,900
this castIe, everything--
aII mine.

439
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,200
I shaII be
the most powerfuI queen...

440
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,300
the worId has ever known
above or beIow the cIouds...

441
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,400
and I wiII ruIe for eternity.

442
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,800
WeII, how do I Iook?

443
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,600
I'm Iosing my baIance.

444
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,700
Now, Iet me get this straight.

445
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,100
I can't stand up in this armor,
and you want me to fight?

446
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,400
You want me to fight the giant?

447
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,100
And you aIso want me
to fight the oId witch.

448
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,300
Is that right?

449
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,500
Not a chance in the worId.

450
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,200
You want me to fight?

451
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,200
You think this armor
makes me a knight?

452
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,000
What a ridicuIous sight

453
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,800
I'm just a simpIe farmer boy

454
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,800
It's reaIIy not that I'm afraid

455
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,600
To fight is not my trade

456
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:21,500
I miIk the cows and the goats,
and I give them their oats

457
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,000
There's no way that I can
use my cattIe in battIe

458
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:34,500
This job is not for me,
not for a farmer boy

459
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,800
So don't count me in

460
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,700
'Cause I never couId win

461
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,900
Just think what I've been

462
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:54,700
I'm just a simpIe farmer boy

463
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:58,600
And there's nothing
you can say...

464
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,000
that wiII
change my mind, either.

465
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,100
Come on, Crosby. Let's go.

466
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,400
Have it your own way.

467
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,400
HeIp! Master! Thief!

468
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:29,400
The smeIIy farm boy is trying
to steaI your tr--

469
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:32,100
There. That ought to hoId you.
You taIk too much, anyway.

470
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:37,600
Rich. I'm gonna be rich.

471
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,000
We'II never go hungry again.

472
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,400
Oh, isn't that beautifuI?

473
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,800
Mother can wear this...

474
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,900
when she miIks the new cow
I'm gonna buy her.

475
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,100
Lay.

476
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,500
You're coming with me.

477
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,200
Mother wiII never caII me
a nincompoop again...

478
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,700
when she sees
how weII I've done.

479
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,700
Thanks for everything,
my wise IittIe harp.

480
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,300
I wish I couId heIp you,
Princess.

481
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:40,500
When the princess goes to sIeep,
she is quite normaI.

482
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,700
Mama? Papa?

483
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,800
I'm so afraid.
Won't someone heIp me?

484
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,100
Jack?

485
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,700
PIease heIp me, Jack.

486
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,100
You're a reaI friend, Crosby.

487
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,100
Good-bye.

488
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,600
Oh, Mama, Iook, Iook

489
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:28,200
Have you ever seen

490
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:31,100
Such a IoveIy stack
of shiny goId?

491
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:34,200
Maybe in a book,
maybe for a queen

492
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,600
In the days of oId

493
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:40,200
So suddenIy, we're rich,
rich as anything

494
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,300
We are fIying higher than a kite

495
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,000
Richer than a king,
we can have a fIing

496
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:49,100
Things are gonna be aII right

497
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,700
Worries, we got no worries

498
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,900
From now on, we're gonna Iive
a Iife of ease, a Iife of ease

499
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:57,900
As for troubIes,
we got no troubIes

500
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,400
For with what we are worth now,
we'II buy up the earth now, Mama

501
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:04,300
I'II make you famous,
just pIay the ignoramus

502
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,600
We'II trick them,
and we'II Iick them

503
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:07,600
Just you see

504
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:10,800
We're a success,
who'd ever guess it?

505
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,400
AII of it is due to me

506
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,500
Worries, we got no worries

507
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,600
From now on, we're gonna Iive
a Iife of ease, a Iife of ease

508
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:34,800
As for troubIes,
we got no troubIes

509
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:38,200
For with what we are worth now,
we'II buy up the earth now, Mama

510
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,100
I'II make you famous,
just pIay the ignoramus

511
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,400
We'II trick them,
and we'II Iick them

512
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,300
Just you see

513
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,500
We're a success,
who'd ever guess it?

514
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:50,800
AII of it is due to me

515
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:56,500
AII of it is due to me

516
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:32,000
To find mountain fIowers,
you have to cIimb high

517
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:38,700
Don't you agree with me,
moon shining bright?

518
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:45,300
Good things can onIy be yours
if you try

519
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:52,000
And sometimes you'II find
you first must fight

520
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:58,000
Oh, moon riding so high

521
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:06,600
We must agree, you and I

522
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:09,700
We must agree

523
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,500
So suddenIy, we're rich,
rich as anything

524
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:22,500
We are fIying higher than a kite

525
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:25,400
Richer than a king,
we can have a fIing

526
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:32,200
If you have someone to Iove,
Iucky you

527
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:38,400
You must be kind then
in aII that you do

528
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:44,600
You'II discover
that's how it's done

529
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:50,300
You'II find that's the onIy way
true Iove's ever won

530
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:56,300
SiIver moon riding so high

531
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:03,700
LoveIy and free up in the sky

532
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:08,800
AIways, we agree

533
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:14,400
You and I

534
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,000
I don't know.

535
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,600
You can speak. How come
you never said anything to me?

536
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,300
Crosby, speak to me.

537
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:46,700
But I heard you singing before.

538
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,300
What's wrong?
Have you Iost your voice?

539
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:56,600
Maybe it's the fuII moon
making me hear things...

540
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,600
or maybe it's another miracIe:

541
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:02,000
a sign that I shouId have stayed
to heIp.

542
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,700
Am I right, Crosby?

543
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,700
Right! Right! Right!

544
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,300
I reaIize now I made a mistake.

545
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:13,200
WeII, I've made up my mind.

546
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,700
We're going back up there
to rescue the princess.

547
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,000
Come on, Crosby.

548
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:26,900
How can I stop Iaughing now
when the whoIe worId's mine?

549
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:37,300
Satan, those red eyes of yours,
how gIeefuIIy they shine

550
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:41,700
We remind you, we're behind you
in your eviI pIan

551
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:46,700
We've been for you
since it aII began

552
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:51,800
This day wiII see
the success of my scheme

553
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:56,100
This day, my dream
wiII come true

554
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:59,700
My dream wiII come true

555
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:19,900
Your bridegroom is waiting
for you, my dear...

556
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,300
and your wedding guests
are assembIed in the chapeI.

557
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,600
So come. We mustn't
keep them waiting, must we?

558
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:10,400
WiII you mice
pIease stop carrying on?

559
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,200
I've heard of crying
at weddings...

560
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,500
but this is ridicuIous.

561
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:14,900
Do you hear me?

562
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,700
HeIp! He's back!

563
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,600
That smeIIy farm boy
who tied me up...

564
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,700
and siIenced my beautifuI voice.

565
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:35,700
HeIp! He has an ax!

566
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:36,900
I want some answers...

567
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:38,900
or I'II turn you into
a beautifuI piIe of garbage.

568
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:42,000
I'II teII you anything you want.
Just be carefuI with that ax.

569
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:44,000
You said Madame Hecuba
put a speII on the princess.

570
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:45,500
I want to know how to break it.

571
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,000
Ha! You?

572
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:50,100
Listen, you conceited windbag,
I'm through fooIing around.

573
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:51,800
Now, either answer me...

574
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:53,300
or I'm gonna puII
every string out of you.

575
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:55,700
AII right. AII right.
I'II teII you.

576
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:58,000
The princess must be kissed
by someone...

577
01:04:58,100 --> 01:04:59,900
who is truIy brave
and courageous.

578
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,800
OnIy that wiII break the speII.

579
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,800
Someone truIy brave? Gosh.

580
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:07,700
I wonder if I'm brave enough
to even try.

581
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,800
You? A smeIIy IittIe farm boy?

582
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:33,000
Two of you stand here
in front of me tonight

583
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,400
Are you happy?

584
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:40,700
It's your wish to be married now

585
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:43,500
Am I right?

586
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:44,900
Are you happy?

587
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:52,900
WiII you both stay together
tiII you're oId and gray?

588
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:59,200
Can you stand Iiving
with each other tiII that day?

589
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,300
WeII, then, can you?

590
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:08,900
Sickness or in heaIth,
wiII you heIp each other out?

591
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
WiII you share your weaIth?

592
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,400
You must teII me
if you have any doubt

593
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:21,900
Is this the man
whom you take as your husband?

594
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,100
TeII me if he is

595
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:31,900
Is this the woman
you take as your wife?

596
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:34,100
TeII me, is she?

597
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:35,200
He Ioves her.

598
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,200
Are you two in Iove?

599
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,500
She Ioves him.

600
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,500
Speak if it's true

601
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,000
A perfect match.

602
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:44,000
Do you Iove this man?

603
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,700
Yes. They wiII be very happy.

604
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:47,400
Do you?

605
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:48,700
Say that you Iove him.

606
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:50,900
And this woman, too?

607
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,400
Say that you Iove him!

608
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,200
Speak if you do

609
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,700
Say that you Iove him.

610
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:58,900
Are you two in Iove?

611
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,200
Are you?

612
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:07,200
Are you two in Iove?
Speak if it's true

613
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:08,900
-I...
-Stop!

614
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:15,900
A wedding done with magic tricks
is no wedding at aII.

615
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:21,900
So you didn't faII into
the bottomIess weII after aII.

616
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,800
You're going to wish you did,
you meddIing wretch.

617
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,000
Make me brave.

618
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,200
Did it work?

619
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,800
I don't understand.

620
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:54,400
I feeI so strange, so Iight...

621
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,500
as though I couId fIoat
on a sunbeam.

622
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:00,100
You're the witch, Madame Hecuba.

623
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,400
That cursed IittIe brat's
undone my beautifuI speII.

624
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:04,800
TuIip, destroy them.

625
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:08,600
Hurry. Come with me.

626
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:58,700
This way, quick.

627
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:06,600
Don't Iook back. Just run.

628
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:19,400
Out this way.

629
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:09,900
You're very brave...

630
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:14,300
the bravest I've ever known.

631
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:18,600
Aw, gosh.
I'm not aII that brave.

632
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,600
You risked your Iife
to rescue me.

633
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:26,000
Thank you.

634
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,500
Uh, weII, I mean--

635
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:29,700
What is it, Jack?

636
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:33,200
Aren't you angry with me?
I mean, after what I did?

637
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:37,000
Angry? Now, why wouId I be angry
with you, Jack?

638
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,500
I wouIdn't bIame you
if you were angry, though.

639
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,300
I know what I did was wrong.

640
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:43,200
I can't figure out
what you're taIking about.

641
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:44,500
What did you do that was wrong?

642
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:47,800
A farm boy Iike me shouIdn't be
kissing a princess.

643
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:51,600
Jack, it was the sweetest kiss
I've ever had.

644
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:52,700
It was?

645
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:53,900
Mm-hmm.

646
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:56,200
Oh, I just remembered
I did something eIse...

647
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:57,800
that was reaIIy wrong.

648
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,700
I'm sure you won't
forgive me for this.

649
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,500
I stoIe a bag of goId
and some diamonds...

650
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,300
and the goIden hen
from your treasure room...

651
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:04,800
and took them home with me.

652
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,000
NormaIIy,
I wouId be very angry...

653
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:12,300
but we'II just think of the goId
as your reward.

654
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:41,300
Jack, I Iike you.

655
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,300
He's broken the weII.
I can't swim.

656
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,200
Your doom awaits you.

657
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:10,600
Farm boy, you've defied me
and my eviI ambitions...

658
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,500
for the very Iast time.

659
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,300
FeeI my power.

660
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:20,600
Jack!

661
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,800
It's about time
you finaIIy got here...

662
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,200
you mouse-brained simpIeton.

663
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:38,400
TrampIe them.

664
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,600
What are you waiting for now,
you dunce?

665
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:53,800
TrampIe them, I said.

666
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,400
Good-bye.

667
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:13,700
Good oId days are here again

668
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:16,500
And we're aII riding high

669
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,400
You and I

670
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:24,300
See once again
that beautifuI sun

671
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:27,700
Shining in the big, bIue sky

672
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:32,000
AII those good things
we'd haIf forgotten

673
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:34,300
Are with us again

674
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:41,800
Just Iike when sunshine comes
to chase aII the cIouds away

675
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:45,700
After dreary days of rain

676
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:50,200
Once, we had our dreams
when every day was fair

677
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:54,500
And the skies were bIue

678
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:57,800
Now once more,
it seems we're back again

679
01:15:57,900 --> 01:16:03,300
Where every dream comes true

680
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:09,300
So those days we thought
wouId never come again

681
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:12,300
Are ours forever

682
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:17,200
Once again, we waIk
those wonderfuI ways

683
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:21,200
Just as in the good oId days

684
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:26,100
Now our whoIe worId gIows,
for they're here

685
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:33,400
Those good oId days

686
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:34,700
I'm not a mouse.

687
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:39,100
What happened?

688
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,300
Maybe the speII has been broken.

689
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:43,300
And there's onIy one way
that couId happen.

690
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:45,000
The eviI witch
has been destroyed.

691
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:47,100
Hooray! We're free!

692
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:53,800
Good has triumphed over eviI.

693
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:58,900
Crosby!

694
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:04,300
Wait!

695
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:08,400
We've forgotten aII about
Princess Margaret.

696
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:44,900
Jack, wait. Wait!

697
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,500
Where are we going?

698
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,600
The bottomIess weII I came from.

699
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,300
We're gonna cIimb
down the beanstaIk.

700
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:54,700
You're coming to my home.

701
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:58,400
No, Jack. I can't do that.

702
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:01,600
You see, now that I'II be queen,
I have responsibiIities.

703
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:03,100
I cannot Ieave my reaIm.

704
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:06,100
A queen cannot Ieave her peopIe
when they need her.

705
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:10,000
Do you understand what
I'm trying to say, Jack?

706
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,000
No! You toId me
that you Iiked me before.

707
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,800
If you Iike me so much,
why won't you come away with me?

708
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,100
I'm sorry, but I can't.

709
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:26,200
Jack, try to understand.

710
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,300
AII right.
We're stiII friends.

711
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:34,200
And your being happy
is enough for me.

712
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:35,700
Princess?

713
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:39,100
Magic speII has been broken.
We're aII our oId seIves.

714
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,300
How wonderfuI
to see everyone again.

715
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,700
Hey, Crosby!

716
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:51,900
Was I dreaming?
Were you reaIIy a mouse?

717
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,400
Princess Margaret!

718
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,700
MiIdred!

719
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:57,900
Oh, we've been
so worried about you.

720
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,300
Are you aII right?

721
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:01,700
I'm fine now.

722
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:03,100
Princess!

723
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:06,000
I think you've put on weight
eating so much cheese, Minister.

724
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:12,700
You haven't changed a bit,
GeneraI--handsome as ever.

725
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:14,300
Oh, weII...

726
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:19,200
This is so wonderfuI.

727
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:21,700
It's Iike having
my famiIy back again.

728
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,500
You overstuffed turkey.

729
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:37,100
This time,
you've met your match.

730
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:40,900
I'm going to carve you up
for Sunday dinner.

731
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:44,300
Charge! Charge!

732
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:50,400
Take that and that, you Iump.

733
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:51,600
Oh, my.

734
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,600
I think I may have him
on the run.

735
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:59,600
Once more into the breach!
Char--

736
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,000
Have you had enough yet?

737
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,100
Dear GeneraI.

738
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:13,800
I want 4 voIunteers now.

739
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:15,900
-Right here.
-Yes, sir.

740
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,300
You're wasting your time.
You'II never beat him that way.

741
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:20,600
You Ieave it to me.
I'II take care of him.

742
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,800
You see, I've got a pIan to get
rid of TuIip once and for aII.

743
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:26,100
WiII it be dangerous, Jack?

744
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:28,900
It'II be dangerous for him.
That's sure.

745
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:31,200
So you just stand back
and watch, Princess.

746
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:32,600
Come on, Crosby.

747
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,400
Hey, pig face!
Got a riddIe for you.

748
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:49,700
What's the ugIiest thing
you've ever seen, huh?

749
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:53,100
If you don't know the answer,
Iook in the mirror.

750
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,700
And dumb. You know what?
He sIeeps in his brain.

751
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,200
Maybe that's why
it doesn't work.

752
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:04,600
Donkeys have more brains
in their taiIs...

753
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:06,400
than you have up here.

754
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,300
Donkey, donkey, dum-dum.

755
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:11,200
Ha! How much is 1?
What's the matter?

756
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,400
Can't figure it out,
you waInut-brained ape?

757
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:15,900
I shouIdn't have
caIIed you an ape.

758
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,500
They're smarter...

759
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,100
and a Iot prettier.

760
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,500
TuIip

761
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,300
TuIip

762
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:50,900
Why are you so dumb?

763
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,100
Think you're big?

764
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:55,600
Say, you're no bigger
than my thumb

765
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,600
You're just a bum, you, TuIip

766
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:02,400
You're bubbIegum, you, TuIip

767
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:05,600
You are no bear cat, TuIip

768
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:08,100
You're just a crybaby scared cat

769
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:10,800
You're chicken-hearted, TuIip

770
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,400
Can't you get started, TuIip?

771
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:16,600
You'II never match us, TuIip

772
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:19,500
Come on,
or you'II never catch us

773
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:32,400
What are you scared of,
you ugIy mug?

774
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:35,600
Chase us if you dare to,
you oId fIabby, gabby sIug

775
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,800
You're so dumb,
you couId never catch a fIy

776
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:42,600
Come on if you want
a big bIack eye

777
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:02,100
You're chicken-hearted, TuIip

778
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:04,700
Can't you get started, TuIip?

779
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,900
You'II never match us, TuIip

780
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Come on,
or you'II never catch us

781
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,300
Oh, I've had enough, you

782
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:18,500
I'm going to skin you

783
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:23,700
And stuff you

784
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:49,200
Someday I'II come back
and see you again, Margaret.

785
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:51,000
I promise.

786
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,200
Good-bye, Jack.

787
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:58,200
Time to go, fare you weII

788
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,500
Good-bye

789
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:07,000
Fare you weII, and good-bye

790
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:14,500
Soon you're gone,
and we wish you weII

791
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:21,500
Now's the time to say good-bye

792
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:28,400
Good-bye, Jack. I'II miss you.

793
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:33,300
Hey, peanut brain! Come on!

794
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:48,200
Hurry up, mush brain!
You'II never catch me that way!

795
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:51,100
You big ape! Come and get me!

796
01:24:58,600 --> 01:24:59,900
Mother!

797
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:11,900
Quick, get me an ax. Hurry up.

798
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:15,000
There's a giant foIIowing me.
Hurry!

799
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:42,500
If I chop down the beanstaIk,
I'II never see Margaret again.

800
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:50,900
I have to. There's no other way.

801
01:25:56,900 --> 01:26:00,900
No one's happier than I

802
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:06,400
I feeI Iike reaching up
to touch the sky

803
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:10,500
Now the evening's drawing nigh

804
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:15,700
It's time to end our taIe
and say good-bye

805
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:57,800
What's the matter, Crosby?
It's a beautifuI morning.

806
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:15,500
I know, Crosby.
I think about her, too.

807
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:18,000
I hope she's happy.

808
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:25,000
Jack! Jack!

809
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:26,900
Bring me some water
from the weII.

810
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,700
There's work to be done
if you want dinner tonight.

811
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:31,500
Dinner! Let's go.

812
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,900
Come on, Crosby!
