1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,982
So how does it work
with gay marriage,

2
00:00:03,004 --> 00:00:05,567
you take his last name
or does he take yours,

3
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:07,213
or ***?

4
00:00:07,235 --> 00:00:11,510
Right now, I'm honestly just
excited that Kurt said yes.

5
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:13,089
Hey, are you looking
forward to prom?

6
00:00:13,123 --> 00:00:14,323
I fell asleep last night

7
00:00:14,358 --> 00:00:16,292
while Tina was texting me
about her prom dress.

8
00:00:16,326 --> 00:00:17,360
(sighs) It's really nice

9
00:00:17,394 --> 00:00:18,728
that you're going
with her, by the way.

10
00:00:18,762 --> 00:00:20,196
Yeah, I guess so.

11
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,198
I don't know, I just...
you know, it's my senior prom,

12
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:24,066
so I kind of wish
I was going with somebody

13
00:00:24,101 --> 00:00:25,134
I really care about.

14
00:00:26,336 --> 00:00:28,371
Damn, I have seriously
been unlucky in love.

15
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:30,206
Come on, guys,
we're back with the Beatles!

16
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,208
(students whooping)

17
00:00:32,242 --> 00:00:33,976
We're leaving
the mop-tops behind

18
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:36,045
and moving into
their experimental years.

19
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,347
Now, the <i>Rubber Soul</i> album
marked a turning point

20
00:00:38,382 --> 00:00:41,083
for the group, where they
literally and figuratively

21
00:00:41,118 --> 00:00:42,485
let their hair down.
Now, the Beatles

22
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:44,487
were the biggest
musical act in the world.

23
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:46,055
They could have remained
in their comfort zones,

24
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:48,391
but instead,
they risked everything

25
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:50,326
to explore new musical worlds.

26
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,228
They had something
important to say,

27
00:00:52,262 --> 00:00:54,296
and they weren't going to let
something as silly as

28
00:00:54,331 --> 00:00:55,931
the fear of failure
get in their way.

29
00:00:55,966 --> 00:00:57,767
SUE (over P.A.):
Good afternoon, McKinley High.

30
00:00:57,801 --> 00:00:59,168
This year, the proms

31
00:00:59,202 --> 00:01:02,038
are being fused into
one giant Brundleprom.

32
00:01:02,072 --> 00:01:03,873
What's a Brundleprom?
I don't get that reference.

33
00:01:03,907 --> 00:01:04,774
That's from <i>The Fly.</i>

34
00:01:04,808 --> 00:01:06,275
SUE:
And now for the moment

35
00:01:06,309 --> 00:01:08,844
that will crush 99%
of your misguided views

36
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:10,780
about your own popularity.

37
00:01:10,814 --> 00:01:12,882
Here are your nominees

38
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:15,551
for Prom King and Queen.

39
00:01:15,585 --> 00:01:18,220
First, here are your nominees
for Prom King:

40
00:01:18,255 --> 00:01:19,255
Blaine Anderson...

41
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:20,856
hooping)

42
00:01:20,891 --> 00:01:22,358
...Mohamed Omar,

43
00:01:22,392 --> 00:01:23,292
Artie Abrams...

44
00:01:23,326 --> 00:01:25,695
Yeah!

45
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:27,930
... "Stoner"  Brett Bukowski.

46
00:01:27,964 --> 00:01:30,299
Wait, I-I really didn't get
nominated for king?

47
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:31,400
And now onto the Queen.

48
00:01:31,435 --> 00:01:32,935
TINA:
<i>Please let it be me God,</i>

49
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:34,236
<i>please let it be me Yahweh,</i>

50
00:01:34,271 --> 00:01:35,237
<i>please let it be me.</i>

51
00:01:35,272 --> 00:01:36,105
Kitty Wilde...

52
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:37,940
But I'm a sophomore.

53
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:39,575
...Aimee Ryan...

54
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:40,576
(whooping)

55
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,577
...Jordan Stern.

56
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:42,812
And, inexplicably,

57
00:01:42,846 --> 00:01:44,280
Tina Cohen-Chang.

58
00:01:44,314 --> 00:01:45,781
Yes! Yes!

59
00:01:45,816 --> 00:01:47,550
Congratulations.
Yes! Yes! Oh, my God, yes!

60
00:01:47,584 --> 00:01:49,618
Six of you will be disappointed.
Yes! Yeah!

61
00:01:49,653 --> 00:01:51,787
Yeah! Yes!
Tina. Wow!

62
00:01:51,822 --> 00:01:53,742
Even though I'm not nominated,
it's such an honor

63
00:01:53,757 --> 00:01:55,091
to be going to prom
with a potential queen.

64
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:56,492
Oh...

65
00:01:56,526 --> 00:01:57,493
Sorry, Sam.

66
00:01:57,527 --> 00:01:58,727
It was so nice of you to offer

67
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:00,029
to go with me,
but I'm going to have

68
00:02:00,063 --> 00:02:01,097
to decline your invitation.

69
00:02:01,131 --> 00:02:03,399
But you already accepted.

70
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:04,967
Yeah, Tina, this
is very uncool.

71
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:06,769
Losing is uncool.

72
00:02:06,803 --> 00:02:09,672
I need to maximize my odds
of taking the crown,

73
00:02:09,706 --> 00:02:11,640
so I think I'm going to go
with a group of single gals

74
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:13,409
to corner the dejected
wallflower vote.

75
00:02:13,443 --> 00:02:14,810
And I am going for it.

76
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:16,846
This is my chance
to be bigger than Jesus.

77
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,481
So can I count on
all your votes?

78
00:02:19,616 --> 00:02:21,283
(whispering):
Awkward.

79
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:22,284
You've got mine.

80
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,786
Besides,

81
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,321
I've got more shots
at Prom Queen.

82
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:26,522
It's Tina's time.

83
00:02:26,556 --> 00:02:28,491
I agree. Hit it!

If I got it,
I would've heard by now.

100
00:03:12,536 --> 00:03:14,503
Okay? And-and-and
the thing is,

101
00:03:14,538 --> 00:03:16,906
is that I wasn't just
auditioning for this for myself.

102
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,574
I was auditioning
for everyone at McKinley.

103
00:03:18,608 --> 00:03:21,143
Okay? I wanted to show
that we're talented enough

104
00:03:21,178 --> 00:03:22,311
to make it in this
insane business.

105
00:03:22,345 --> 00:03:24,647
Okay, well, one of us
sort of already did.

106
00:03:24,681 --> 00:03:25,848
I booked a commercial.

107
00:03:25,882 --> 00:03:27,550
It's a little embarrassing,

108
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:29,618
because it was for that
yeast infection medication,

109
00:03:29,653 --> 00:03:30,820
Yeast-I-Stat.

110
00:03:30,854 --> 00:03:32,588
But they sent me a rough cut.

111
00:03:32,622 --> 00:03:34,390
Do you want to see?

112
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:36,425
Yeah.

113
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:41,096
Let's face it.

114
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:42,264
There are good kinds of yeast,

115
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:44,400
and bad kinds of yeast.

116
00:03:45,602 --> 00:03:48,337
But bad yeast goes scat
with Yeast-I-Stat.

Oh, hi, Kitty.

135
00:04:28,945 --> 00:04:30,479
Could I talk to you
for a second?

136
00:04:30,513 --> 00:04:32,748
I was so psyched
that a fellow Cheerio!

137
00:04:32,782 --> 00:04:34,016
Was nominated for Prom Queen.

138
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,351
Thanks, Bree.

139
00:04:35,385 --> 00:04:36,352
And then I heard
that you weren't

140
00:04:36,386 --> 00:04:37,519
going to campaign for it,

141
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:39,355
and instead you were
throwing your support

142
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:40,823
to that Asian girl
from Glee Club

143
00:04:40,857 --> 00:04:42,458
because you thought
it was "her turn."

144
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:43,792
Now, if that's true,

145
00:04:43,827 --> 00:04:45,060
you might want to tie
yourself down,

146
00:04:45,095 --> 00:04:46,295
because this is gonna
be a rough ride.

147
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:47,663
I just wanted to remind you

148
00:04:47,697 --> 00:04:49,932
that a Cheerio!
Has not won Prom Queen

149
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:51,400
for several years now.

150
00:04:51,434 --> 00:04:53,602
We've had Prom Queens
from Glee Club,

151
00:04:53,637 --> 00:04:56,171
including the Jewish girl
and a gay dude.

152
00:04:56,206 --> 00:04:57,606
And if we're not careful,

153
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:59,808
I swear to God we're gonna have
a black transsexual

154
00:04:59,843 --> 00:05:01,510
named Unique as Prom Queen

155
00:05:01,544 --> 00:05:03,412
before we have a Cheerio!
As Prom Queen.

156
00:05:03,446 --> 00:05:05,180
Now, I know you're
thinking to yourself:

157
00:05:05,215 --> 00:05:06,515
"But O.M.G., Bree,

158
00:05:06,549 --> 00:05:07,917
I love the Asian girl
from Glee Club."

159
00:05:07,951 --> 00:05:09,991
Well, punch yourself in the face
so I don't have to.

160
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,854
I do not give a flying fart,

161
00:05:11,888 --> 00:05:13,923
and the Cheerios!
Do not give a flying fart,

162
00:05:13,957 --> 00:05:15,858
about how much you love
your sisters from Glee Club.

163
00:05:15,892 --> 00:05:17,927
You have 51 weeks
out of the year

164
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:19,295
to love your sisters
from Glee Club,

165
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:20,429
and this week is not...

166
00:05:20,463 --> 00:05:22,131
I repeat, not...
one of them.

167
00:05:22,165 --> 00:05:24,867
This week is about winning
Prom Queen for the Cheerios!,

168
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:27,303
and that's not gonna happen
if you're off campaigning

169
00:05:27,337 --> 00:05:29,438
for Kimchi Cohen-Barf
or whoever.

170
00:05:29,472 --> 00:05:31,273
Are you an idiot, Kitty?

171
00:05:31,308 --> 00:05:32,641
That's not
a rhetorical question.

172
00:05:32,676 --> 00:05:34,343
I literally want you to tell me
if you're mentally slow,

173
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:35,644
so I can be sure
you're not nominated

174
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:37,179
for future prom courts.

175
00:05:44,688 --> 00:05:47,022
Sam. I didn't know
you were gonna be in here.

176
00:05:47,057 --> 00:05:48,223
Oh. Hey, Mr. Shue.

177
00:05:48,258 --> 00:05:49,558
(chuckles) Yeah.

178
00:05:49,592 --> 00:05:51,593
You know, a lot of people
say the Beatles were the,

179
00:05:51,628 --> 00:05:52,728
like, the best
band ever, right?

180
00:05:52,762 --> 00:05:53,729
That's right.

181
00:05:53,763 --> 00:05:55,197
Well, what if I told you that

182
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:56,198
the Beatles wrote
exactly zero songs

183
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:57,533
about what it feels like

184
00:05:57,567 --> 00:05:59,668
when you tell a girl
that you don't think is hot

185
00:05:59,703 --> 00:06:00,903
you'll go to prom with her
because you feel bad,

186
00:06:00,937 --> 00:06:02,237
and then you think you're gonna

187
00:06:02,272 --> 00:06:03,539
get nominated for Prom King
and then you don't,

188
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:04,606
and the not-hot girl says,
"I don't want to go

189
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:05,975
to prom with you anymore."

190
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:08,089
Would you still say they were
the greatest band ever?

191
00:06:08,111 --> 00:06:08,911
SUE:
Hey there, Buttchin.

192
00:06:08,945 --> 00:06:10,879
Ah, Samgelina Jolie.

193
00:06:10,914 --> 00:06:12,181
Oh, I hate to interrupt

194
00:06:12,215 --> 00:06:14,283
the blatantly
homoerotic overtones

195
00:06:14,317 --> 00:06:17,619
of whatever the two of you are
on the verge of crying about,

196
00:06:17,654 --> 00:06:19,355
so I will be brief.

197
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:20,723
Now, seeing as
how your students

198
00:06:20,757 --> 00:06:22,925
in the glee club come and
go for weeks at a time

199
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,326
with no explanation whatsoever,

200
00:06:24,361 --> 00:06:26,562
I'm sure that it will not
come to you as a surprise

201
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:28,931
that we have an abysmal
attendance record

202
00:06:28,965 --> 00:06:31,500
at this school due to illness.

203
00:06:31,534 --> 00:06:32,835
Therefore, I am instituting

204
00:06:32,869 --> 00:06:35,771
mandatory vaccinations
at this school,

205
00:06:35,805 --> 00:06:37,406
starting with your
pansexual orgy

206
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,074
of future patient zeroes,
the glee club.

207
00:06:39,109 --> 00:06:41,276
When you say vaccinations,
do you mean shots?

208
00:06:41,311 --> 00:06:42,778
That's right, Imbecile
Homeless Teen Drifter.

209
00:06:42,812 --> 00:06:45,381
And we will begin
with the polio vaccine.

210
00:06:45,415 --> 00:06:46,582
WILL:
Sue, polio was all but

211
00:06:46,616 --> 00:06:48,450
eradicated in the 1950s.

212
00:06:48,485 --> 00:06:50,252
Or so they'd have us believe.

213
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:53,255
I saw a documentary
last night on FDR,

214
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:54,590
and it made me very suspicious

215
00:06:54,624 --> 00:06:56,191
about that glee kid
in the wheelchair.

216
00:06:56,226 --> 00:06:58,627
Artie? He was in a car accident
when he was a kid.

217
00:06:58,661 --> 00:07:01,630
Fact: there is a meningitis
outbreak in Los Angeles.

218
00:07:01,664 --> 00:07:03,732
Fact: Mercedes Jones

219
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:05,701
recently returned
from Los Angeles...

220
00:07:05,735 --> 00:07:07,369
Wait, I cannot
get a vaccination.

221
00:07:07,404 --> 00:07:09,638
Needles totally freak me out.
Sue, I'm all about keeping

222
00:07:09,672 --> 00:07:11,373
the kids in this school healthy,
but this is ridiculous.

223
00:07:11,408 --> 00:07:13,342
Hey, I would watch
your tone with me

224
00:07:13,376 --> 00:07:14,810
if I were you,
Busted Timberfake.

225
00:07:14,844 --> 00:07:16,578
I'm not your coworker anymore.

226
00:07:16,613 --> 00:07:18,113
I'm your boss.

227
00:07:18,148 --> 00:07:19,615
And what I say goes.

228
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:21,784
And if you and Nipples

229
00:07:21,818 --> 00:07:23,519
the Strippin' Clown
don't get your shots

230
00:07:23,553 --> 00:07:25,687
by the end of the week,
you're fired.

231
00:07:25,722 --> 00:07:26,922
(school bell ringing)

232
00:07:26,956 --> 00:07:29,324
(several pianos
playing different music)

233
00:07:35,498 --> 00:07:37,132
What's going on in here?

234
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:38,267
Carmen Tibideaux
needed volunteers

235
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:39,568
for the annual
NYADA piano tuning.

236
00:07:39,602 --> 00:07:42,104
So, did you hear about
Santana's good news?

237
00:07:42,138 --> 00:07:43,605
That she doesn't have
a yeast infection?

238
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,773
I'm really happy for her.

239
00:07:44,808 --> 00:07:46,775
Okay, what's wrong with you?

240
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,677
Because the Rachel I know
would be furious at Santana

241
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:50,345
for breezing into town

242
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,147
and beating us at
booking the first gig.

243
00:07:52,182 --> 00:07:54,616
You have lost your mojo
obsessing over this part.

244
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:56,785
We can't let our
feelings of self-worth

245
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,454
be determined by
some part in a play.

246
00:07:58,488 --> 00:08:00,823
That's easy for you to say;
you just got engaged.

247
00:08:00,857 --> 00:08:03,258
True, but I'm not pinning
all my future happiness on it.

248
00:08:03,293 --> 00:08:05,794
I'm telling you, you have
got to get your mojo back.

249
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:07,930
Right here, right now.

250
00:08:07,964 --> 00:08:09,331

(crashing)

293
00:10:18,268 --> 00:10:19,768
- Hello?
- Hey.

294
00:10:19,803 --> 00:10:20,903
- Hi.
- Oh!

295
00:10:20,937 --> 00:10:22,605
Are you here for your
polio/meningitis cocktail?

296
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,640
I wasn't sure if
I should call it

297
00:10:24,674 --> 00:10:27,643
polingitus or meningiolio.

298
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:29,845
I like the second one;
it sounds like Italian food.

299
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,981
(imitating Marlon Brando): I'm going
to give him a shot he can't refuse.

300
00:10:32,015 --> 00:10:34,049
(laughs)

301
00:10:34,084 --> 00:10:37,386
Anyways, yes, I am
here for my shot.

302
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,721
To be honest,

303
00:10:38,755 --> 00:10:41,023
I'm kind of freaked
out by needles,

304
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,937
and even if I wasn't,
I'd kind of be freaked out

305
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,460
by you with a needle.

306
00:10:44,494 --> 00:10:45,961
I saw you kill that sausage.

307
00:10:45,996 --> 00:10:47,429
Oh, yeah.

308
00:10:47,464 --> 00:10:48,531
Yeah, that, I know.

309
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,432
I had kind of a...
an extended panic attack

310
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:52,301
during the two weeks we studied
injections last semester.

311
00:10:52,335 --> 00:10:53,836
Wait, are you not a real nurse?

312
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,137
I'm a sophomore in college.

313
00:10:55,172 --> 00:10:56,505
This is kind of an internship

314
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,841
to help me get
into nursing school.

315
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,143
Okay. Ready for our shot?

316
00:11:01,178 --> 00:11:03,479
Is that the same needle
you put in that sausage?

317
00:11:03,513 --> 00:11:05,514
Good eye.

318
00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:07,783
You know what?
I'm-I'm just gonna...

319
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:10,319
I'm just gonna come
back later, okay?

320
00:11:11,788 --> 00:11:13,489
It was cool meeting you.

321
00:11:13,523 --> 00:11:14,423
(chuckles)

322
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,426
Penny Owen.

323
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,296
Sam Evans.

324
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,397
(school bell ringing)

325
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,265
Here are the latest
prom poll numbers.

326
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,900
And your 3:00 coffee.

327
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:27,536
I said no caffeine until prom.

328
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:30,206
I can't afford to look tired
like some sad, anemic dishrag.

329
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,740
(girl gasps) Oh, my God!

330
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,242
What is with these numbers?

331
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:36,278
There's been a sudden spike
in Kitty's popularity.

332
00:11:40,684 --> 00:11:42,685
TINA:
Kitty?

333
00:11:44,554 --> 00:11:46,222
This is unbelievable!

334
00:11:46,256 --> 00:11:47,523
Unbelievable.

335
00:11:47,557 --> 00:11:49,658
Tina, I didn't put these up.
That's not even me.

336
00:11:49,693 --> 00:11:51,193
That's my head photoshopped

337
00:11:51,228 --> 00:11:52,328
onto Olivia Munn.

338
00:11:52,362 --> 00:11:54,263
Oh, please.
I should've known

339
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,198
that when you weirdly
said you'd support me,

340
00:11:56,233 --> 00:11:57,833
it was just some
classic backstabby,

341
00:11:57,867 --> 00:11:58,968
gaslighty Kitty mind game.

342
00:11:59,002 --> 00:12:00,363
Hey, uh, what's with
these posters?

343
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,837
I thought you were
supporting Tina.

344
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:03,339
And why is
your head photoshopped

345
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:07,209
onto Olivia Munn's body
from February 2011?

346
00:12:07,244 --> 00:12:08,344
What? I read <i>Maxim.</i>

347
00:12:08,378 --> 00:12:10,713
Don't worry, Tina.
Come on.

348
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:15,985
This is Tina's one big chance
to finally get what she wants.

349
00:12:18,388 --> 00:12:20,522
Why does no one believe me?

350
00:12:21,558 --> 00:12:22,825
Oh, right.

351
00:12:22,859 --> 00:12:24,893
The habitual lying.

352
00:12:24,928 --> 00:12:25,995
(grunts)

353
00:12:34,571 --> 00:12:36,538
SANTANA:
I dig your name.

354
00:12:36,573 --> 00:12:38,073
So, do you think
that your parents,

355
00:12:38,108 --> 00:12:40,242
like, knew that you were gonna
grow up to be a lesbian

356
00:12:40,277 --> 00:12:42,111
giving you a boy name?

357
00:12:42,145 --> 00:12:44,380
I'm a not a lesbian.
Oh, uh...

358
00:12:44,414 --> 00:12:46,849
You just wear so much
eyeliner... I don't...

359
00:12:46,883 --> 00:12:48,584
I'm totally kidding.
I love lady parts.

360
00:12:48,618 --> 00:12:50,519
Dani is short for Danielle.

361
00:12:50,553 --> 00:12:52,888
And, no, I don't
think they knew.

362
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:55,324
My parents are actually
kind of d-bags.

363
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,559
They caught me making out
with a girl in the basement

364
00:12:57,594 --> 00:12:58,594
and all hell broke loose.

365
00:12:58,595 --> 00:13:00,329
I grabbed my guitar,

366
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,597
and never looked back.

367
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:03,098
What about you?

368
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:05,401
My parents were pretty cool.

369
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:06,835
Grandma not so much.

370
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,003
I had a girlfriend.

371
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:09,371
And she was bi.

372
00:13:09,406 --> 00:13:13,309
Any chance of you guys
getting back together?

373
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:16,278
I love her, but, um, it's over.

374
00:13:16,313 --> 00:13:18,080
It's probably for the best.

375
00:13:18,114 --> 00:13:20,182
I think you need

376
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,285
a 100% Sapphic goddess.

377
00:13:25,755 --> 00:13:28,590
Um... I think I'm gonna
go get the salt...

378
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,459
the salt sh-shakers.

379
00:13:31,428 --> 00:13:32,961
(silverware rattles) Shakers...

380
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:37,366
Oh, my, God, I am sensing

381
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,201
some serious energy exchanges
happening over there.

382
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,737
No, no, help me, okay?

383
00:13:41,771 --> 00:13:43,939
(nervous laugh)

384
00:13:43,973 --> 00:13:46,408
I'm getting that stinky
panic sweat under my boobs.

385
00:13:46,443 --> 00:13:49,244
Why? She's cute, she's sweet,
she's gay, ask her out.

386
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,246
Okay, I've never been
with an actual lesbian.

387
00:13:51,281 --> 00:13:52,781
It's been all bisexuals
like Brittany

388
00:13:52,816 --> 00:13:54,083
or college girls trying
to experiment.

389
00:13:54,117 --> 00:13:55,317
You're scared.

390
00:13:55,352 --> 00:13:56,852
I've never seen you
scared before.

391
00:13:56,886 --> 00:13:57,853
It's so cute!

392
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,888
You tell no one of this.
Seriously.

393
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:02,458
I think that I might like her,
and it is terrifying.

394
00:14:02,492 --> 00:14:03,459
Listen.

395
00:14:03,493 --> 00:14:04,854
She seems like
a really smart girl.

396
00:14:04,861 --> 00:14:06,628
And if she's a smart girl,

397
00:14:06,663 --> 00:14:08,504
then she's not gonna miss out
on an opportunity

398
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:10,332
to be with someone
as amazing as you.

399
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:11,433
You're right.
Okay?

400
00:14:11,468 --> 00:14:12,901
She's smart.
Okay, go clean up.

401
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:13,936
Okay.

402
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:18,140
Mmm, mm-mm.

403
00:14:18,174 --> 00:14:20,642
Hey, Sam, we're gonna go pick up
our tux rentals.

404
00:14:20,677 --> 00:14:22,644
You coming? Uh, could you
guys grab mine for me?

405
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,146
I need to, uh...

406
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,814
go to the nurse's office...
snake bite.

407
00:14:25,849 --> 00:14:27,950
That looks like a human bite.

408
00:14:27,984 --> 00:14:28,951
From a really big mouth.

409
00:14:28,985 --> 00:14:30,219
You sure you didn't
bite yourself

410
00:14:30,253 --> 00:14:31,453
and pretend it was a snake?

411
00:14:31,488 --> 00:14:32,788
Why would I do that?

412
00:14:32,822 --> 00:14:34,590
Oh, I don't know, maybe...

413
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:35,858
maybe for the same exact reason
why you left math

414
00:14:35,892 --> 00:14:37,226
to get a Band-Aid
for your hangnail?

415
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,660
She's gonna be
at the prom chaperoning.

416
00:14:38,695 --> 00:14:40,596
You can always just take it
slow and ask her for a dance.

417
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,664
She'll stop liking me, okay?
The key for me is to only spend

418
00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:44,600
a few minutes with a girl
and then get away.

419
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,935
My personality is like
a radioactive asteroid.

420
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,537
Spend too much time with it

421
00:14:48,571 --> 00:14:50,038
and it could kill you.
That's insane.

422
00:14:50,073 --> 00:14:51,807
You have an amazing personality.

423
00:14:51,841 --> 00:14:53,509
You have all of your...
impressions.

424
00:14:53,543 --> 00:14:56,044
And-and all of your...

425
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,080
impressions.

426
00:14:58,114 --> 00:14:59,715
I was thinking of doing
my Denzel impression for her.

427
00:14:59,749 --> 00:15:01,283
(imitating Denzel Washington):
All right, all right.

428
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,885
I'm coming for you
and when I do,

429
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:04,720
she didn't drink the vodka,
I drank the vodka.

430
00:15:04,721 --> 00:15:07,222
Remember those Titans.
All right, training day.

431
00:15:07,257 --> 00:15:08,524
You better come correct
'cause I'm coming

432
00:15:08,558 --> 00:15:09,658
for you and when I do,

433
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:11,627
it's your day to train.

434
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,529
Training day is here.
(laughs)

435
00:15:13,563 --> 00:15:14,663
My man, all right.

436
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:18,901
Embrace the Beatles mantra.

437
00:15:18,935 --> 00:15:20,335
"Charge forth fearlessly."

438
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,737
You may get hurt.

439
00:15:21,771 --> 00:15:23,172
Some girls are worth it.

440
00:15:23,206 --> 00:15:25,774
And I have a feeling
you think she is.

441
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:27,276
Go get them, Denzel.

442
00:15:32,615 --> 00:15:35,217
(The Beatles'
"Something" begins)

00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:39,154

00:17:56,459 --> 00:17:58,460
(music fades)

468
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:10,633
Why are you packing up
your things?

469
00:18:10,668 --> 00:18:12,101
Sue fired me for incompetence.

470
00:18:12,136 --> 00:18:13,736
I was giving one
of her Cheerios!

471
00:18:13,771 --> 00:18:16,606
A urine test
and another one a vaccination,

472
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,341
and I got my vials all mixed up,

473
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,009
and, well...

474
00:18:20,044 --> 00:18:21,344
you can guess what happened.

475
00:18:21,378 --> 00:18:23,046
Well, y-you can't leave.

476
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,847
Why?

477
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:25,415
Because we only

478
00:18:25,449 --> 00:18:26,583
hung out once so far.

479
00:18:26,617 --> 00:18:28,084
And-and it wasn't
for long, but, you know,

480
00:18:28,118 --> 00:18:29,419
I had a great time with you.

481
00:18:29,453 --> 00:18:31,454
And you're, like, almost
totally normal and cool.

482
00:18:31,489 --> 00:18:32,455
Really?

483
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,157
All right.
I want you to give me my shot.

484
00:18:34,191 --> 00:18:35,825
If you can get me
to take this shot,

485
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:39,262
Sue will have to see how great
of a nurse you are and keep you.

486
00:18:39,296 --> 00:18:42,365
One of these days,
I'm gonna get this right.

487
00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:44,267
Might as well be today.

488
00:18:47,805 --> 00:18:49,472
(gasping)

489
00:18:52,743 --> 00:18:53,743
You can't fire her.

490
00:18:53,777 --> 00:18:55,211
Who?

491
00:18:55,246 --> 00:18:56,746
Nurse Penny.
You can't get rid of her.

492
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,448
I mean, I've been terrified
of needles my entire life.

493
00:18:58,482 --> 00:19:00,016
And she just used her impressive

494
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,051
nursing skills
and nurturing bedside manner

495
00:19:02,086 --> 00:19:04,220
to give me a meningitis shot
in my butt.

496
00:19:04,255 --> 00:19:06,956
I'm sorry, but your mouth
is incredibly distracting.

497
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:08,958
Please put a pair of
white cotton panties

498
00:19:08,993 --> 00:19:10,360
over your head and cover up

499
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:12,128
that horizontal
talking moose knuckle.

500
00:19:12,162 --> 00:19:14,163
Just promise me
Penny still has a job here.

501
00:19:14,198 --> 00:19:15,498
Oh...

502
00:19:15,533 --> 00:19:18,167
I believe someone's
got a little crush.

503
00:19:18,202 --> 00:19:19,202
No, I don't. I don't have...

504
00:19:19,236 --> 00:19:20,770
Fine. You've convinced me.

505
00:19:20,804 --> 00:19:24,274
Nurse Bumble McQuirkypoops
will remain at McKinley High.

506
00:19:24,308 --> 00:19:26,276
I could use a new plaything.

507
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,444
You know, yesterday, I
asked her for two aspirin,

508
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:30,013
and she accidentally
gave me steroids.

509
00:19:30,047 --> 00:19:31,814
(laughs) Which means
I can finally

510
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:33,383
finally stop buying
from Mark McGwire.

511
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:34,384
(groans)

512
00:19:34,418 --> 00:19:35,818
He always wants to hang out,

513
00:19:35,853 --> 00:19:38,655
and I just want to get
the hell out of his house.

514
00:19:38,689 --> 00:19:41,057
Why are you still here?

515
00:19:41,091 --> 00:19:42,358
Get the hell out of my office.

516
00:19:42,393 --> 00:19:43,526
(school bell ringing)

517
00:19:43,561 --> 00:19:45,228
Tina for Prom Queen.
Don't be racist.

518
00:19:45,262 --> 00:19:47,564
Vote for Tina.

519
00:19:47,598 --> 00:19:48,865
Vote for Tina.
Don't be racist.

520
00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:51,034
If you don't vote for Tina,

521
00:19:51,068 --> 00:19:52,869
you're a racist.

522
00:19:52,903 --> 00:19:54,537
Are you doing okay, Dottie?
Ooh.

523
00:19:54,572 --> 00:19:55,738
How do you know my name?

524
00:19:55,773 --> 00:19:56,973
Come on.

525
00:19:57,007 --> 00:19:58,541
Everyone knows Dottie Kazatori.

526
00:19:58,576 --> 00:20:01,878
Tina Cohen-Chang's
personal slave.

527
00:20:01,912 --> 00:20:02,879
Break it down.

528
00:20:02,913 --> 00:20:04,314
You hate Tina, don't you?

529
00:20:04,348 --> 00:20:07,350
I do wish she'd hurry up
and graduate.

530
00:20:07,384 --> 00:20:09,024
How would you like
to be on the Cheerios!?

531
00:20:10,988 --> 00:20:12,722
That's, like, my life's dream.

532

BREE: That's why
you're perfect

533
00:20:14,325 --> 00:20:15,758
for our little plan.

534
00:20:15,793 --> 00:20:16,859
Uh...

535
00:20:18,662 --> 00:20:20,630
Mazel, Berry.
Looks like you're gonna make it

536
00:20:20,664 --> 00:20:23,266
through your first graveyard
shift without collapsing.

537
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,434
What is that?

538
00:20:24,468 --> 00:20:26,035
The latest edition
of <i>Backstage.</i>

539
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,337
Hot off the presses.

540
00:20:27,371 --> 00:20:28,938
"Hot off the presses"?

541
00:20:28,973 --> 00:20:30,873
What does that mean? I'm
over my fear of rejection.

542
00:20:30,908 --> 00:20:32,909
And I'm no longer
afraid of failing.

543
00:20:32,943 --> 00:20:35,445
I'm auditioning for everything
I'm remotely right for.

544
00:20:35,479 --> 00:20:37,547
Including but not limited
to the role of Bottom

545
00:20:37,581 --> 00:20:39,515
at the Cape Cod Players
production of <i>Midsummer,</i>

546
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:42,685
and also Annie Sullivan's
landlady in <i>The Miracle Worker</i>

547
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,655
now casting at the New Jersey
Theater for the Deaf.

548
00:20:45,689 --> 00:20:46,756
Where do you think you're going?

549
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,157
You still have ten minutes

550
00:20:48,192 --> 00:20:50,393
and two dozen
sugar caddies to caddy.

551
00:20:50,427 --> 00:20:51,794
See, I thought that
that was something

552
00:20:51,829 --> 00:20:53,396
that you and Dani
could do alone.

553
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,498
Okay, no, come on.

554
00:20:55,532 --> 00:20:57,266

the lesbian matchmaker.

555

I'm so tired.

556
00:20:58,702 --> 00:21:00,403
I have to get home.
No, you're not. You have to...

557
00:21:00,437 --> 00:21:01,804
Bye, Rachel.
See you tomorrow.

558
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:02,939

No, not yet.

561
00:21:10,347 --> 00:21:15,151
I like to watch the sun rise
over that building.

562
00:21:15,185 --> 00:21:19,422
I just love how the diner goes
from being quiet and dark

563
00:21:19,456 --> 00:21:21,858
to suddenly just... glowing.

564
00:21:22,926 --> 00:21:24,927
I've never seen it.

565
00:21:24,962 --> 00:21:26,863

We'll watch it together.

for one lousy night of my life,

728
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:42,055

00:32:18,892 --> 00:32:20,226

This is the girl responsible

for the giant slushee bucket
at prom.

801
00:35:56,689 --> 00:35:59,558
No, I mean, literally,
who is this?

802
00:35:59,592 --> 00:36:00,959
She's in a
Cheerios! uniform,

803
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:02,461
but I swear
I've never seen her before.

804
00:36:02,495 --> 00:36:03,662
You put me on the team.

805
00:36:03,696 --> 00:36:04,796
Black Cheerio!...

806
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:06,298
you think I'd remember
a black Cheerio.

807
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:08,333
It's not like
we get a lot of them.

808
00:36:08,368 --> 00:36:10,802
Sue Sylvester, this girl needs
to be punished.

809
00:36:10,837 --> 00:36:12,771
Now, I'll admit that
when the bucket of goo

810
00:36:12,805 --> 00:36:14,973
hit the Asian girl in the head,
it was hilarious.

811
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:16,174
Then the bucket itself fell

812
00:36:16,209 --> 00:36:18,210
and hit the stoner
kid in the head,

813
00:36:18,244 --> 00:36:20,212
knocked him
straight to the ground.

814
00:36:20,246 --> 00:36:21,313
Priceless.

815
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:22,781
Top-notch entertainment.

816
00:36:22,815 --> 00:36:25,183
But that does not change
the fact

817
00:36:25,218 --> 00:36:28,387
that this girl right here
needs to understand

818
00:36:28,421 --> 00:36:31,490
that pulling hilarious,
top-notch pranks

819
00:36:31,524 --> 00:36:32,524
has consequences.

820
00:36:32,558 --> 00:36:33,558
She should be suspended.

821
00:36:35,728 --> 00:36:38,397
Bree...

822
00:36:38,431 --> 00:36:41,600
I'm promoting you
to captain of the Cheerios!

823
00:36:41,634 --> 00:36:43,635
And buying you a Le Car.

824
00:36:43,669 --> 00:36:45,537
ROZ: What?!
What?

825
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:47,572
Chocolate Cheerio!, oh,

826
00:36:47,607 --> 00:36:49,107
that evil glimmer in your eye

827
00:36:49,142 --> 00:36:50,909
reminds me of a
young Sue Sylvester.

828
00:36:50,943 --> 00:36:54,713
You found a brand-new way
to go after the glee club,

829
00:36:54,747 --> 00:36:56,715
and I want you to keep at it.

830
00:36:56,749 --> 00:36:58,216
ROZ: I thought
you said you wanted

831
00:36:58,251 --> 00:36:59,351
the glee club to win nationals.

832
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:01,887
I do, but the glee club
needs an enemy.

833
00:37:01,921 --> 00:37:03,855
The only time they
were any good

834
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:07,059
was when I was hell-bent
on destroying them.

835
00:37:07,093 --> 00:37:09,361
Plus, I once sang onstage
with them in plaid pajamas,

836
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:12,964
and ever since, I don't think
they find me quite so scary.

837
00:37:14,467 --> 00:37:17,869
I want you to go after the
glee club with all you've got.

838
00:37:17,904 --> 00:37:20,439
I want it to get weird.

839
00:37:20,473 --> 00:37:22,441
I want you to pull
something so psychotic

840
00:37:22,475 --> 00:37:26,545
that they can't help but start
crying when they think about it

841
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:28,580
in the middle of the
inevitable Journey song

842
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:30,348
they'll sing to
win at nationals

843
00:37:30,383 --> 00:37:33,051
after deciding on it
at the very last moment.

844
00:37:33,086 --> 00:37:35,454
You got it?

845
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:42,494
I think I need an agent.

846
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:45,330
I guess those
contracts I signed

847
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:48,233
for those commercials said that
I waived my right to residuals

848
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:51,436
in exchange for a lifetime
supply of Yeast-I-Stat.

849
00:37:51,471 --> 00:37:53,472
(scoffs) Though I don't
know whose toxic vagina

850
00:37:53,506 --> 00:37:55,107
would need that
much of that stuff.

851
00:37:55,141 --> 00:37:56,508
I mean, if you're
producing that much yeast,

852
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:57,576
you should probably
start a bakery.

853
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,777
(sighs)

854
00:37:58,811 --> 00:38:00,779
Are you ready for me?
(gasps)

855
00:38:00,813 --> 00:38:02,914
Sorry. What is Lady Hummel
doing here?

856
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:04,449
Working. Vogue.com doesn't pay,

857
00:38:04,484 --> 00:38:07,185
and I need some seed cash
to start my Madonna cover band.

858
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,320
You guys, this is so great.

859
00:38:08,354 --> 00:38:09,794
I feel like I'm on <i>Smash,</i>
season one.

860
00:38:09,822 --> 00:38:11,189
Well, enjoy it while it lasts,

861
00:38:11,224 --> 00:38:13,191
because soon you'll be
dumping us to play Fanny Brice.

862
00:38:13,226 --> 00:38:14,926
Oh, no, that ship has sailed.

863
00:38:14,961 --> 00:38:17,195
If I got it,
I would have heard by now.

864
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,031
Rachel, be positive!

865
00:38:18,064 --> 00:38:19,664
I am positive, okay?

866
00:38:19,699 --> 00:38:20,999
My whole life,
I've been looking

867
00:38:21,033 --> 00:38:22,734
to be a part of something
special to feel special,

868
00:38:22,768 --> 00:38:24,436
but the truth is,
is that I <i>am</i> special, okay?

869
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,571
And I don't need producers
to tell me that.

870
00:38:26,606 --> 00:38:28,673
I'm gonna play this part,
and if it's not

871
00:38:28,708 --> 00:38:31,576
in this production,
then that is their loss.

872
00:38:31,611 --> 00:38:33,478
Isn't it amazing
how life seems so easy

873
00:38:33,513 --> 00:38:35,180
when you just don't give a fart?

874
00:38:35,214 --> 00:38:36,314
I mean, look at this.

875
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:37,749
Hummel is getting married,

876
00:38:37,783 --> 00:38:39,451
Berry is just
full of confidence,

877
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:41,853
and I finally have a girlfriend

878
00:38:41,888 --> 00:38:44,389
who I don't have to worry about
straying for penis.

879
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:46,791
Then let's make a pledge:
we stay in this town together

880
00:38:46,826 --> 00:38:47,959
for two years, all right?

881
00:38:47,994 --> 00:38:50,028
For soaring success
or miserable failure.

882
00:38:50,062 --> 00:38:51,363
None of us bail

883

Okay. Pinky swear.

885
00:38:54,767 --> 00:38:55,800
Come on.

886
00:38:55,835 --> 00:38:57,335

GUNTHER:
Someone in booth 14

890
00:39:01,908 --> 00:39:03,241
is looking for the short one.

891
00:39:04,243 --> 00:39:06,144
Go.

892
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,181

00:39:09,215 --> 00:39:10,549
Gunther, that's my Yeast-I-St...

894
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:11,683
What the hell?

895
00:39:16,756 --> 00:39:18,957
Mr. Campion.

896
00:39:21,594 --> 00:39:24,596
Do you have
any whole cakes, Rachel?

897
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:27,933
Just a whole cake?

898
00:39:27,967 --> 00:39:29,334
Mm-hmm. I'd like one.

899
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:30,835
Okay.

900
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:33,305
But I need you to write
something on it for me.

901
00:39:33,339 --> 00:39:34,439
Can you do that?

902
00:39:34,473 --> 00:39:36,141
Yeah.
Good.

903
00:39:36,175 --> 00:39:39,344
I want you to write, mm...

904
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:43,014
"Congratulations, Rachel Berry.
You are Fanny Brice."

905
00:39:45,051 --> 00:39:47,252
(voice breaks):
Are you serious?

906
00:39:48,254 --> 00:39:49,854
Are you serious?!

907
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:50,589
Really?!

00:39:50,623 --> 00:39:52,090
Oh, my God! Really?!

913
00:39:58,931 --> 00:40:00,765
I got it!
She got the part?

914
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,734
I got it! I got it!
Whoo! Whoo!
