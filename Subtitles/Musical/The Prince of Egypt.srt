Come, Rameses. We will show Pharaoh
your new baby brother...

68
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:36,832
- Moses.

00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,001

 ##Deliver us ####

77
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,917
- Ha, ha!
- Faster, you beasts!

78
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,919
You run like mules.

79
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:31,261
- Hey, Rameses, how'd you like
your face carved on a wall?
- Someday, yes.

80
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:34,264
How about now?

81
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:39,228
You almost killed me!

82
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,647
Oh, come on.
Where's your sense of fun?

83
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:45,567
- Oh, it's fun you want?

84
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:48,737
- Whoa!

85
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:54,576
Whoa! Aah!

86
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,207
Ohh. Moses?

87
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:03,460
Whoa!

88
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:10,509
Whoa!

89
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,597
 Whoa!

90
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:21,854
Come on, you.
Whoa!

91
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:24,940
Come on, Moses. Admit it.
You've always looked up to me.

92
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,734
Yes, but it's
not much of a view.

93
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,072
Hyah! Whoo!

94
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:35,325
- Hey!

95
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,871
- Second born, second place.
-Not for long.

96
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,550
Whoa!

97
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,975
- Whoa!
- Aah! Aaah!

98
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:20,287
Jump!

99
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:42,476
 Whoa!

100
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,328
Whoo!

101
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:06,208
 You don't think we'll
get in trouble for this, do you?

102
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,210
 No, not a chance.

103
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:11,797
Why do the gods
torment me...

104
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:14,633
with such reckless,
destructive,

105
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:17,261
- blasphemous sons?
- Father, hear what l...

106
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,972
Be still!
Pharaoh speaks.

107
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:24,059
I seek to build
an empire,

108
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,937
and your only thought
is to amuse yourselves...

109
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,939
by tearing it down.

110
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,941
Have I taught you nothing?

111
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:35,028
You mustn't be so hard on yourself, Your
Majesty. You're an excellent teacher.

112
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:38,198
It's not your fault
your sons learned nothing.

113
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,200
- They learned blasphemy.
- True.

114
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:43,412
Father,
the fault is mine.

115
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:46,498
I goaded Rameses on,
and so I am responsible.

116
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:49,168
Hmm.
Responsible.

117
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:52,254
Do you know the meaning
of that word, Rameses?

118
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,256
I understand, Father.

119
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:58,385
And do you understand the task for which
your birth has destined you?

120
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,971
The ancient traditions.

121
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,307
When I pass
into the next world,

122
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,476
then you will be
the morning and evening star.

123
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,229
One damaged temple does not
destroy centuries of tradition.

124
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:12,482
But one weak link
can break the chain...

125
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:16,445
of a mighty dynasty!

126
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,122
You have my leave to go.

127
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:29,124
Father.

128
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,473
Father?

129
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:48,519
You know it was
really my fault.

130
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:51,104
Must you be
so hard on him?

131
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,942
Moses, you will never
have to carry a burden...

132
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:58,195
like the crown
I will pass to Rameses.

133
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:03,200
He must not allow himself
to be led astray,

134
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,203
not even by you, my son.

135
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:11,625
All he cares about is...
is your approval.

136
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,711
I know he will live up
to your expectations.

137
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:17,339
He only needs
the opportunity.

138
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:20,259
Maybe. Maybe so.

139
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:25,138
Go now. I shall
see you both tonight.

140
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,692
##

141
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:42,322
- Well, that went well.
- Just go away.

142
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,324
Could have been worse.

143
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,953
"The weak link in the chain. "
That's what he called me.

144
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:53,166
Well, you are
rather pathetic.

145
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:56,253
Irresponsible,
ignorant of the traditions.

146
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:59,256
He practically accused me
of bringing down the dynasty.

147
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,009
Yeah, I can see it now.
There go the pyramids!

148
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:05,512
- You can laugh about it.

149
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:09,266
Statues cracking and toppling over.
The Nile drying up.

150
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:14,188
Single-handedly, you will
manage to bring the greatest
kingdom on Earth to ruin.

151
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:16,190
Tell me this, Moses.

152
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:18,650
Why is it that every time
you start something,

153
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:21,445
I'm the one
who ends up in trouble?

154
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,406
- Ah, man! Oh.

155
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:28,535
- Ah, it's Rameses. You're in trouble.
- Get down here!

156
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,414
- I think you owe us an apology.
- Oh, my new thing!

157
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:35,375
- I am so upset!
- You might as well.

158
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:37,961
- You'll pay for this.
- We're gonna tell the Pharaoh!

159
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:41,215
- Hmm.

160
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:45,302
- Oh, look at me. I'm drenched again.
- Hey. I figured it out.

161
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:48,055
- You know what your
problem is, Rameses?
- What?

162
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:52,017
- You care too much.
- And your problem is,
you don't care at all.

163
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,020
Oh, in that case, I suppose
you care a lot more than I do...

164
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:58,899
that we're late for the banquet,
for example.

165
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:02,319
I'm done for.

166
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:05,739
- Father will kill me.
- Don't worry.

167
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:08,200
Nobody will even
notice us coming in.

168
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:16,375
" Nobody will
even notice."

169
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:21,547
Ah, the young princes.

170
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:24,633
Rameses, you were just
named prince regent.

171
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:28,929
You are now responsible
for overseeing all the temples.

172
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:31,807
I suggest
you get over there...

173
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,309
and thank your father.

174
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:37,312
- Apparently, Moses,

175
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:39,439
someone thought he...

176
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:42,442
just needed
the opportunity.

177
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:46,321
- My lord Pharaoh.

178
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:49,074
I propose that the high priests
offer tribute...

179
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,076
to their new regent.

180
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,787
 An excellent idea.
Hotep! Huy!

181
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:55,747
- Huy.
- Hmm?

182
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:57,833
- The Midian girl.
- That's a good idea!

183
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,835
Go get her.

184
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,380
By the power of Ra,

185
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,758
we present for your
delectation and delight...

186
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:10,804
an exotic apparition
stolen from a faraway land.

187
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:22,733
- We offer you this
delicate desert flower.

188
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:32,409
Let us inspect
this... desert flower.

189
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:36,622
- More like a desert cobra.

190
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:39,458
 Not much of a snake
charmer, are you?

191
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,877
That's why I
give her to you.

192
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,547
- No, that's generous, but...
- I won't be given to anyone.

193
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:48,717
Especially an arrogant,
pampered palace brat!

194
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,012
 Are you going to
let her talk to you like that?

195
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:55,182
You will show the proper respect
for a prince of Egypt.

196
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:57,809
But I am showing you
all the respect you deserve...

197
00:16:57,935 --> 00:16:59,311
none!

198
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:02,648
- No. Wait!

199
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:05,067
- Be still.
- Untie this rope!

200
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,069
- I demand you set me free!
- Be still.

201
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:10,197
- Let go!
- As you wish.

202
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:12,616
Aah! Ohh!

203
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:24,586
You there!

204
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,630
Have her dried off...

205
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:30,217
and sent to
Prince Moses' chambers.

206
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:34,054
If it pleases you,
Father, my first act as regent...

207
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,098
is to appoint Moses...

208
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:38,809
as royal chief...

209
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,894
architect.

210
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:10,174
Well...

211
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:13,010
Right.

212
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:31,278
Shh. Come on.

213
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:42,247
Guards.

214
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:44,875
 Prince Moses.

215
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:49,755
Uh...

216
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:53,717
there's a-a man
tied up in my room.

217
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:57,804
- Well, look into it.
- Right away, sire.

218
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:15,072
 Please, I need water.

219
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:18,242
- I have a long journey ahead of me.
- May God protect you.

220
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:20,786
Thank you.

221
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:24,540
Hut-hut.

222
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:40,347
- Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. l...

223
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:42,891
- Oh, please forgive me. l...

224
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:46,436
I didn't expect
to see...you...

225
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,438
here, of all places,

226
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:50,899
at-at-at our door.

227
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:54,611
- Mmm, at last!
- At last?

228
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:57,281
Didn't I tell you, Aaron? I knew he
would return to us when he was ready.

229
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:59,324
Miriam, do you
want us flogged?

230
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:01,326
I knew you cared
about our freedom.

231
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,787
- Miriam!
- Freedom? Why would
I care about that?

232
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:07,749
Because you're...
well, you're our brother.

233
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,751
- What?
- Be...

234
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,508
- They never told you?
- Who never told me what?

235
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:21,138
But you're here.
You must know.

236
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:24,016
- Be careful, slave!
- Oh, my good prince.

237
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:27,144
Um, she's-she's exhausted
from the day's work.

238
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:29,188
Uh, not that it
was too much.

239
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:31,190
We... We quite
enjoyed it.

240
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:34,026
But-But she's confused
and knows not to whom she speaks.

241
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:37,946
I know to whom I speak, Aaron.
I know who you are.

242
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,449
- You are not a prince of Egypt.
- Miriam.

243
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:43,160
- What did you say?
- Your Highness, pay her no heed.

244
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,996
C-Come, Miriam.
May I discuss something with you?

245
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,373
No, Aaron. No!
Please, Moses, you must believe!

246
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:50,918
- That's enough.
- You were born of my mother, Yocheved.

247
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:53,170
- Stop it.
- You are our brother!

248
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:56,131
Now you go too far.
You shall be punished.

249
00:20:56,215 --> 00:20:59,551
No! Please, uh,
Your Highness.

250
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:02,554
She's ill. She's very ill.
We beg your forgiveness.

251
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:04,890
- Please, Miriam, let us go.
- No, Aaron.

252
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:08,018
Our mother set you adrift
in a basket to save your life!

253
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:10,312
Save my life?
From who?

254
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:12,523
Ask the man
that you call " Father."

255
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:17,694
- How dare you?
- God saved you to be our deliverer.

256
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:21,657
- Enough of this.
- And you are, Moses.
You are the deliverer.

257
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,659
- I said, enough!

258
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:27,788
You will regret
this night.

259
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:39,800
# Hush now, my baby #

260
00:21:39,925 --> 00:21:43,303
# Be still, love
Don't cry #

261
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:47,558
#Sleep
as you're rocked #

262
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:50,978
# By the stream #

263
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:55,816
#Sleep and remember #

264
00:21:55,941 --> 00:22:00,404
##My last lullaby ##

265
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:04,241
#So I'll be with you #

266
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:08,829
# When you dream ##

267
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:28,849
- Did you see him? It's Moses.

268
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:52,372
 ##Gleaming in the moonlight ##

269
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:56,293
#Cool and clean
and all I've ever known ##

270
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:58,795
#All I ever wanted ##

271
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:03,675
#Sweet perfumes
of incense ##

272
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:08,013
#And graceful rooms
of alabaster stone ##

273
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:12,434
#All I ever wanted ##

274
00:23:12,518 --> 00:23:14,895
# This is my home ##

275
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,897
# With my father
mother, brother ##

276
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:19,441
#Oh, so noble
Oh, so strong##

277
00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:23,111
#Now I am home ##

278
00:23:23,195 --> 00:23:26,240
#Here among my trappings
and belongings ##

279
00:23:26,365 --> 00:23:28,784
#I belong##

280
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:31,245
-##And if anybody doubts it ##

281
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:35,499
# They couldn't
be more wrong##

282
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:38,168
#I am a sovereign
prince of Egypt ##

283
00:23:38,252 --> 00:23:41,672
#A son of the proud history
that's shown ##

284
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:46,343
#Etched on every wall ##

285
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:49,805
#Surely this is all
I ever wanted ##

286
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:53,642
#All I ever wanted ##

287
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:57,729
#All I ever ##

288
00:23:57,855 --> 00:24:01,650
# Wanted ####

289
00:25:30,072 --> 00:25:32,449
###

290
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:52,946
The Hebrews grew
too numerous.

291
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:56,408
They might have risen
against us.

292
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:59,953
Father, tell me
you didn't do this.

293
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:02,789
Moses,

294
00:27:02,915 --> 00:27:06,960
sometimes,
for the greater good,

295
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:10,422
sacrifices must be made.

296
00:27:17,596 --> 00:27:19,473
Sacrifices?

297
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:25,354
Oh, my son.

298
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:28,649
They were only slaves.

299
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:49,670
Moses?

300
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:52,506
Is this where
you found me?

301
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:56,093
Moses, please try
to understand.

302
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:03,600
So... So everything
I thought,

303
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:07,563
everything I am,
is a lie.

304
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:09,565
No.

305
00:28:09,648 --> 00:28:13,193
You are our son,
and we love you.

306
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:17,406
Why did you choose me?

307
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:20,492
We didn't, Moses.

308
00:28:20,576 --> 00:28:22,494
The gods did.

309
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:33,046
# This is your home
my son #

310
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:35,257
# Here the river
brought you #

311
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:39,887
# And it's here
the river meant #

312
00:28:40,012 --> 00:28:43,390
# To be your home #

313
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:46,476
# Now you know
the truth, love #

314
00:28:46,602 --> 00:28:50,105
# Now forget
and be content #

315
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:53,192
# When the gods
send you a blessing #

316
00:28:53,275 --> 00:28:58,238
# You don't ask why
it was sent ##

317
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:18,675
Last night, the gods
granted me a vision.

318
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,971
I'm not merely going to restore
this temple, I will make it more grand,

319
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:26,517
more splendid
than any other one in Egypt.

320
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:49,081
Aah.

321
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:51,083
- Get up!
- Aah!

322
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,676
Moses! Look.

323
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:04,847
Fate has turned our little misadventure
into a great opportunity.

324
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,641
- Get up, old man!
- Father will be so pleased...

325
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:11,812
Put your back into it!

326
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:14,815
Faster!

327
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,900
 This is just
the beginning.

328
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:20,696
A gateway will open to an entire
new city of white limestone,

329
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:22,698
more dazzling
than the sun.

330
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:25,325
- And here, a statue of Hapi.

331
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,286
I said, hurry!

332
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:30,122
- ...two great column halls.
- Stop it!

333
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:32,249
- Somebody's got to stop this!
- There's nothing we can do.

334
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:46,513
Stop it.

335
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:48,515
- Stop. Stop it!

336
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,102
- Leave that man alone!
- Moses!

337
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:06,950
Out of my way.
Out of my way. Move!

338
00:31:07,034 --> 00:31:09,036
Who did this?

339
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:13,040
 Up there! It's him.
Up there.

340
00:31:25,886 --> 00:31:27,304
Moses!

341
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:42,194
Moses, what's going on?
Moses!

342
00:31:50,369 --> 00:31:52,913
Moses!

343
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:57,084
- Moses!
- Let me go!

344
00:31:57,209 --> 00:32:00,796
- No, wait.
- You saw what happened.
I just killed a man.

345
00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:03,507
We can take care
of that.

346
00:32:03,632 --> 00:32:05,843
I will make it
so it never happened.

347
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:08,512
Nothing you can say
can change what I've done.

348
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:12,391
I am Egypt, the morning
and the evening star.

349
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:15,227
If I say day is night,
it will be written,

350
00:32:15,352 --> 00:32:18,230
and you will be
what I say you are.

351
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:20,482
I say you are innocent.

352
00:32:20,566 --> 00:32:24,152
What you say does not matter.
You don't understand.

353
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:26,154
I can't stay here
any longer.

354
00:32:26,238 --> 00:32:28,156
- Moses!
- No!

355
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,952
All I've ever known
to be true is a lie.

356
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:37,040
I'm not who
you think I am.

357
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:39,835
What are you
talking about?

358
00:32:39,918 --> 00:32:43,547
Go ask the man
I once called " Father."

359
00:32:46,508 --> 00:32:49,469
Moses?

360
00:32:50,596 --> 00:32:52,431
Please.

361
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:02,149
Good-bye, brother.

362
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,156
Moses!

363
00:33:10,449 --> 00:33:12,326
Moses!

364
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:19,142
No.

365
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,481
Aah!

366
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:19,244
- Aaah!

367
00:35:27,669 --> 00:35:31,548
Hey, wait.

368
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:35,260
Please.

369
00:35:45,604 --> 00:35:47,689
- Ohh!

370
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:52,194
- Oh!

371
00:35:58,784 --> 00:36:00,702
- What are you doing?

372
00:36:00,786 --> 00:36:04,665
- Help!
- Let our sheep drink!

373
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,875
Leave us alone!
Get away!

374
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:11,421
-Stop it!

375
00:36:11,547 --> 00:36:13,590
My father's
the high priest of Midian.

376
00:36:13,674 --> 00:36:16,426
You're going to be
in big trouble.

377
00:36:16,552 --> 00:36:19,596
- Aah!
- Hey, you.

378
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,349
Aren't these
your camels?

379
00:36:23,684 --> 00:36:26,270
- Hut-hut!
- No, no! No, no!

380
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:28,730
- Wait!
- Wait, stop!

381
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:37,489
Whoa!

382
00:36:45,163 --> 00:36:47,040
What are you girls
doing?

383
00:36:47,165 --> 00:36:49,626
We're trying to get the funny man
out of the well.

384
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,421
Trying to get the funny man
out of the well.

385
00:36:52,504 --> 00:36:55,007
- Well, that's one
I've never heard before.

386
00:36:55,132 --> 00:36:58,635
 Oh, my.
Oh, uh, don't worry down there!

387
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:00,888
Uh, we'll get you out.
Hold on!

388
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,019
You.

389
00:37:07,102 --> 00:37:10,147
Huh?

390
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,816
- Ohh!

391
00:37:15,485 --> 00:37:17,362
Mm-hmm.

392
00:37:19,448 --> 00:37:23,452
That's why Papa says
she'll never get married.

393
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:31,418
You don't have to do this. Ladies,
please, I'm really... I'm really quite...

394
00:37:31,543 --> 00:37:33,921
No, not there, please.

395
00:37:34,046 --> 00:37:36,715
That tickles. Ladies,
you've cleaned every inch of me.

396
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,967
- Whoa, l... I was wrong.

397
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:42,721
Let me through. Let me through.
I want to see him.

398
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:46,850
Ah! You are most welcome.

399
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:49,520
You should not be
a stranger in this land.

400
00:37:49,603 --> 00:37:52,147
You have been sent
as a blessing.

401
00:37:52,231 --> 00:37:55,400
-Tonight, you shall be my honored guest.

402
00:37:57,861 --> 00:38:01,448
My father, Jethro,
High Priest of Midian.

403
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:13,502
Psst. Sit with me.

404
00:38:13,585 --> 00:38:15,963
Um, all right.

405
00:38:18,674 --> 00:38:21,468
Psst. Not yet.

406
00:38:21,593 --> 00:38:24,304
- Oh, sorry.
- My children,

407
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:28,517
let us give thanks
for this bountiful food.

408
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:32,521
And let us also give thanks
for the presence...

409
00:38:32,604 --> 00:38:36,400
of this brave, young man
whom we honor here tonight.

410
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:40,821
- Please, sir, I wish you wouldn't.

411
00:38:40,946 --> 00:38:43,991
I've done nothing in my life
worth honoring.

412
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:51,290
First, you rescue Tzipporah
from Egypt,

413
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:54,334
- then you defend my younger
daughters from brigands.

414
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:57,671
You think that is nothing?

415
00:38:57,796 --> 00:39:01,216
It seems you do not know
what is worthy of honor.

416
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,677
# A single thread
in a tapestry #

417
00:39:03,802 --> 00:39:06,263
# Though its color
brightly shine #

418
00:39:06,346 --> 00:39:08,515
#Can never see
its purpose #

419
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,351
#In a pattern
of the grand design #

420
00:39:12,853 --> 00:39:15,230
# And the stone that sits
on the very top #

421
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:17,441
#Of the mountain's
mighty face #

422
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:19,651
# Does it think
it's more important #

423
00:39:19,776 --> 00:39:23,947
# Than the stones
that form the base #

424
00:39:24,072 --> 00:39:26,617
#So how can you see
what your life is worth #

425
00:39:26,742 --> 00:39:29,036
#Or where
your value lies #

426
00:39:29,161 --> 00:39:33,040
# You can never see
through the eyes of man #

427
00:39:33,165 --> 00:39:35,709
# You must look
at your life #

428
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:39,171
# Look at your life
through heaven's eyes #

429

433
00:39:50,516 --> 00:39:53,977
No, I don't know how.

 ##A lake of gold

a shepherd boy ##

439

00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:21,171
#Or is it the beginning##

443
00:40:21,255 --> 00:40:25,300
-##Of a new and brighter birth ##

444
00:40:25,384 --> 00:40:27,970
#So how do you measure
the worth of a man ##

445
00:40:28,053 --> 00:40:30,264
#In wealth or strength
or size ##

446
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:34,434
#In how much he gained
or how much he gave ##

447
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,020
# The answer will come ##

448
00:40:37,104 --> 00:40:39,773
# The answer will come
to him who tries ##

# To look at his life
through heaven's eyes ##

450
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,739
#And that's why we share
all we have with you ##

451
00:40:47,823 --> 00:40:50,284
# Though there's little
to be found ##

452
00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:52,452
# When all you've got
is nothing##

453
00:40:52,578 --> 00:40:55,038
# There's a lot
to go around ##

00:40:57,124 --> 00:40:59,501
#No life can escape
being blown about ##

455

#By the winds
of change and chance ##

456
00:41:02,504 --> 00:41:05,215
-##And though you never
know all the steps ##
- Dance with me.

457
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:09,678
- No, l... No. No!
-## You must learn to join the dance ##

Mmm.

476
00:42:22,835 --> 00:42:24,711
I love you.

477
00:42:42,229 --> 00:42:44,147
Ahh!

478
00:43:04,877 --> 00:43:07,337
It's too early
for this.

479
00:44:06,355 --> 00:44:08,774
 Moses.

480
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:12,986
Moses.

481
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:16,490
Moses.

482
00:44:16,615 --> 00:44:18,200
Moses.

483
00:44:21,328 --> 00:44:23,247
Here I am.

484
00:44:24,957 --> 00:44:28,919
 Take the sandals
from your feet,

485
00:44:29,044 --> 00:44:33,090
for the place on which you stand
is holy ground.

486
00:44:40,806 --> 00:44:42,683
Who are you?

487
00:44:44,476 --> 00:44:47,437
 I am that I am.

488
00:44:49,815 --> 00:44:51,900
I don't understand.

489
00:44:51,984 --> 00:44:55,571
I am the God of your ancestors,

490
00:44:55,654 --> 00:44:59,074
Abraham, Isaac
and Jacob.

491
00:45:01,994 --> 00:45:05,873
 You were born of my
mother, Yocheved. You are our brother.

492
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:11,461
What do You want
with me?

493
00:45:13,255 --> 00:45:17,467
I have seen the oppression
of My people in Egypt...

494
00:45:17,593 --> 00:45:20,470
and have heard their cry.

495
00:45:20,554 --> 00:45:23,765
- Stop it!
Leave that man alone!

496
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:27,394
 So I have come down
to deliver them out of slavery...

497
00:45:28,562 --> 00:45:30,981
and bring them
to a good land,

498
00:45:32,733 --> 00:45:37,070
a land flowing
with milk and honey.

499
00:45:39,573 --> 00:45:42,743
And so, unto Pharaoh,

500
00:45:42,868 --> 00:45:45,787
I shall send...

501
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:47,956
you.

502
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:51,835
Me? Wh-Who am I
to lead these people?

503
00:45:51,919 --> 00:45:54,671
They'll never believe me.
They won't even listen.

504
00:45:54,796 --> 00:45:57,299
I shall teach you
what to say.

505
00:45:57,382 --> 00:46:00,511
 Let my people go!

506
00:46:00,636 --> 00:46:02,804
But I was their enemy.

507
00:46:02,888 --> 00:46:07,267
I was the prince of Egypt, the son of
the man who slaughtered their children.

508
00:46:07,392 --> 00:46:09,853
You've... You've chosen
the wrong messenger.

509
00:46:09,978 --> 00:46:12,648
H-How can I even speak
to these people?

510
00:46:12,731 --> 00:46:15,359
Who made man's mouth?

511
00:46:15,484 --> 00:46:19,321
Who made the deaf, the mute,
the seeing or the blind?

512
00:46:19,404 --> 00:46:22,324
Did not I?
Now go!

513
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:38,257
Oh, Moses,

514
00:46:38,382 --> 00:46:43,053
I shall be with you when you
go to the king of Egypt.

515
00:46:43,178 --> 00:46:45,931
But Pharaoh
will not listen.

516
00:46:49,852 --> 00:46:53,021
So I will stretch out
My hand...

517
00:46:53,105 --> 00:46:55,440
and smite Egypt...

518
00:46:55,524 --> 00:46:58,193
with all My wonders.

519
00:47:02,281 --> 00:47:06,535
Take the staff
in your hand, Moses.

520
00:47:06,618 --> 00:47:08,704
With it,

521
00:47:08,787 --> 00:47:12,708
you shall do My wonders.

522
00:47:17,212 --> 00:47:19,965
I shall be with you,
Moses.

523
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:23,802
- Moses.

524
00:47:25,554 --> 00:47:27,639
 Moses.

525
00:48:47,427 --> 00:48:49,471
But, Moses,

526
00:48:49,555 --> 00:48:52,349
you are just one man.

527
00:48:55,686 --> 00:48:57,521
Tzipporah,

528
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:02,359
please.

529
00:49:09,366 --> 00:49:11,743
Look at your family.

530
00:49:14,746 --> 00:49:17,583
They are free.

531
00:49:17,666 --> 00:49:19,710
They have a future.

532
00:49:19,793 --> 00:49:22,462
They have hopes
and dreams...

533
00:49:22,588 --> 00:49:25,632
and the promise
of a life with dignity.

534
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:31,263
That is what I want
for my people.

535
00:49:32,681 --> 00:49:35,225
And that is why
I must do the task...

536
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:38,478
that God has given me.

537
00:49:50,282 --> 00:49:52,659
I'm coming with you.

538
00:50:55,013 --> 00:50:58,976
###

539
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:01,728
###

540
00:51:17,411 --> 00:51:19,329
####

541
00:51:21,123 --> 00:51:22,958
Rameses.

542
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:26,336
Moses?
Is it really?

543
00:51:31,466 --> 00:51:33,510
 Moses!

544
00:51:33,635 --> 00:51:36,013
- Rameses!
- Where have you been?
I took you for dead.

545
00:51:38,557 --> 00:51:41,852
Look at you!
Pharaoh.

546
00:51:41,935 --> 00:51:45,355
Well, look at you.
What on earth are you dressed as?

547
00:51:46,899 --> 00:51:50,194
Oh, Rameses,
it's so good to see you.

548
00:51:50,277 --> 00:51:52,196
 Excuse me, Your Majesty.

549
00:51:52,279 --> 00:51:57,492
We are compelled to remind you
this man committed a serious
crime against the gods.

550
00:51:57,576 --> 00:51:59,995
We are loathe
to bring it up, mind you.

551
00:52:00,078 --> 00:52:02,664
The law clearly states
the punishment for such a crime...

552
00:52:02,748 --> 00:52:04,750
- Death!
- We hesitate to say it.

553
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:08,128
Be still.
Pharaoh speaks.

554
00:52:09,338 --> 00:52:12,341
I am the morning
and the evening star.

555
00:52:12,424 --> 00:52:14,384
Rameses.

556
00:52:14,468 --> 00:52:16,553
- It shall be as I say.

557
00:52:16,678 --> 00:52:21,058
I pardon forever all crimes
of which he stands accused...

558
00:52:21,141 --> 00:52:23,685
and will have it known
that he is...

559
00:52:23,769 --> 00:52:26,063
our brother Moses,

560
00:52:26,146 --> 00:52:28,148
the prince of Egypt.

561
00:52:32,402 --> 00:52:34,279
Rameses,

562
00:52:35,447 --> 00:52:38,534
in my heart,
you are my brother,

563
00:52:38,617 --> 00:52:41,370
but things cannot be
as they were.

564
00:52:41,453 --> 00:52:43,747
I see no reason why not.

565
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:50,045
You know I am a Hebrew, and the God
of the Hebrews came to me.

566
00:52:50,128 --> 00:52:52,673
What?

567
00:52:52,798 --> 00:52:55,384
He commands that you
let His people go.

568
00:52:59,304 --> 00:53:01,932
Commands?

569
00:53:06,895 --> 00:53:10,566
Behold... the power of God.

570
00:53:24,997 --> 00:53:28,584
Well, uh, impressive.

571
00:53:28,667 --> 00:53:31,170
Hmm.

572
00:53:31,295 --> 00:53:35,465
Very well, Moses.
I'll play along.

573
00:53:35,591 --> 00:53:38,051
Hotep. Huy.

574
00:53:38,177 --> 00:53:41,305
Give this snake charmer
our answer.

575
00:54:02,743 --> 00:54:05,579
 By the power of Ra.

576
00:54:05,704 --> 00:54:07,789
Mut.

577
00:54:07,873 --> 00:54:09,833
Nut.

578
00:54:09,917 --> 00:54:11,877
- Khnum.
- Ptah.

579
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,171
- Nephthys.
- Nekhbet.

580
00:54:14,296 --> 00:54:16,089
-Sobek.
-Sekhmet.

581
00:54:16,215 --> 00:54:19,176
Sokar. Selket. Reshpu.

582
00:54:19,301 --> 00:54:21,428
- Wadjet.
-Anubis.

583
00:54:21,553 --> 00:54:23,430
-Anukis.
-Seshmu.

584
00:54:23,555 --> 00:54:25,474
- Meshkent.
- Hemsut.

585
00:54:25,557 --> 00:54:27,476
- Tefnut.
- Heket.

586
00:54:27,559 --> 00:54:30,187
- Mafdet.
- Ra, Mut, Nut, Ptah.

587
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:32,314
Hemsut, Tefnut,
Sokar, Selket.

588
00:54:32,397 --> 00:54:34,149
Seshmu, Reshpu,
Sobek, Wadjet.

589
00:54:34,233 --> 00:54:37,194
Heket, Mafdet,
Nephthys, Nekhbet, Ra!

590
00:54:40,113 --> 00:54:42,824
##So you think
you've got friends ##

591
00:54:42,908 --> 00:54:45,577
#In high places #

592
00:54:45,702 --> 00:54:50,207
# With the power
to put us on the run #

593
00:54:50,332 --> 00:54:53,669
# Well, forgive us
these smiles #

594
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:56,380
#On our faces #

595
00:54:56,463 --> 00:55:00,717
# You'll know what power is
when we are done #

596
00:55:00,801 --> 00:55:02,719
 Son.

597
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:09,351
# You're playing
with the big boys now #

598
00:55:09,434 --> 00:55:14,356
- # Playing with the big boys now #
- Oh, that's pretty.

599
00:55:14,439 --> 00:55:18,694
- # Every spell and gesture #
- # Tells you who's the best #

600
00:55:18,777 --> 00:55:21,989
 # You're playing with
the big boys now #

601
00:55:22,114 --> 00:55:27,244
## You're playing with
the big boys now ##

602
00:55:27,327 --> 00:55:31,999
- # You're playing with
the big boys now #

603
00:55:32,124 --> 00:55:34,334
#Stop this
foolish mission #

604
00:55:34,459 --> 00:55:36,086
# Watch a true magician #

605
00:55:36,211 --> 00:55:40,007
#Give an exhibition how #

606
00:55:40,132 --> 00:55:42,342
 # Pick up your
silly twig, boy #

607
00:55:42,467 --> 00:55:45,762
## You're playing with
the big boys now ##

608
00:55:45,846 --> 00:55:48,682
- Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
- ##By the power of Ra ##

609
00:55:48,807 --> 00:55:50,893
#Mut, Nut ##

610
00:55:50,976 --> 00:55:52,978
#Khnum, Ptah ##

611
00:55:53,061 --> 00:55:57,107
#Sobek, Sekhmet
Sokar, Selket ##

612
00:55:57,232 --> 00:56:00,777
#Anubis, Anukis, Hemsut
Tefnut, Meshkent, Mafdet ##

613
00:56:00,903 --> 00:56:04,615
## You're playing with
the big boys now ##

614
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:08,952
## You're playing with
the big boys now ##

615
00:56:09,077 --> 00:56:13,040
#By the might of Horus
you will kneel before us ##

616
00:56:13,165 --> 00:56:16,710
#Kneel to our
splendorous power ##

617
00:56:16,835 --> 00:56:18,295
- # You put up a front #
- # You put up a fight #

618
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,464
# And just to show
we feel no spite #

619
00:56:20,589 --> 00:56:22,508
# You can be our acolyte #

620
00:56:22,591 --> 00:56:26,053
- # But first, boy it's time to bow #
- # Kowtow #

621
00:56:26,178 --> 00:56:27,596
#Or it's your own grave
you'll dig, boy ##

622
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:30,641
# You're playing with
the big boys ##

623
00:56:30,724 --> 00:56:33,477
# Playing with the big boys
Playing with the big boys #

624
00:56:33,602 --> 00:56:37,314
#Playing with the big boys
Playing with the big boys ##

625
00:56:37,397 --> 00:56:40,651
# Playing with
the big boys now ##

626
00:56:40,776 --> 00:56:42,945
- They love it.

627
00:57:00,212 --> 00:57:03,257
 All right, Moses.
I know you.

628
00:57:03,382 --> 00:57:05,843
What's this really about?

629
00:57:06,927 --> 00:57:10,681
Rameses, look.

630
00:57:10,764 --> 00:57:12,683
What do you see?

631
00:57:16,645 --> 00:57:20,190
A greater Egypt
than that of my father.

632
00:57:20,274 --> 00:57:22,985
That is not
what I see.

633
00:57:23,068 --> 00:57:27,614
 Moses, I cannot
change what you see.

634
00:57:27,739 --> 00:57:31,410
I have to maintain
the ancient traditions.

635
00:57:31,535 --> 00:57:34,705
I bear the weight
of my father's crown.

636
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:37,749
Do you still not understand
what Seti was?

637
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:41,086
He was
a great leader.

638
00:57:41,211 --> 00:57:44,715
His hands bore the blood
of thousands of children.

639
00:57:44,798 --> 00:57:46,383
Hmph.
Slaves.

640
00:57:46,466 --> 00:57:48,385
My people.

641
00:57:48,468 --> 00:57:52,639
And I can no longer hide
in the desert while they suffer...

642
00:57:52,764 --> 00:57:54,933
at your hands.

643
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,480
So...

644
00:58:00,606 --> 00:58:03,483
you have returned...

645
00:58:03,609 --> 00:58:05,944
only to free them.

646
00:58:16,622 --> 00:58:18,916
I'm sorry.

647
00:58:27,341 --> 00:58:29,259
Yes.

648
00:58:30,886 --> 00:58:33,805
I had hoped...

649
00:58:33,889 --> 00:58:35,807
that...

650
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,197
I do not know this God.

651
00:58:51,448 --> 00:58:53,575
Neither will I
let your people go.

652
00:58:53,659 --> 00:58:55,577
Rameses, please,
you must listen...

653
00:58:55,661 --> 00:58:58,747
I will not be
the weak link!

654
00:59:06,588 --> 00:59:09,132
Tell your people
as of today...

655
00:59:09,258 --> 00:59:12,302
their workload
has been doubled,

656
00:59:12,386 --> 00:59:14,304
thanks to your God.

657
00:59:15,722 --> 00:59:18,642
Or is it thanks...

658
00:59:18,725 --> 00:59:20,644
to you?

659
00:59:25,691 --> 00:59:28,277
It's Moses.

660
00:59:30,571 --> 00:59:33,156
Moses! Ohh.

661
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,158
So, Moses,

662
00:59:35,242 --> 00:59:38,662
how does it feel when you
get struck to the ground?

663
00:59:40,163 --> 00:59:43,125
I didn't mean
to cause you more pain.

664
00:59:43,208 --> 00:59:46,128
I'm just trying to do
as God told me.

665
00:59:46,211 --> 00:59:49,840
God? When did God start
caring about any of us?

666
00:59:49,965 --> 00:59:54,136
In fact, Moses, when did you start
caring about slaves?

667
00:59:54,219 --> 00:59:56,680
Was it when you found out
that you were one of us?

668
00:59:56,763 --> 00:59:58,682
Don't listen to him.

669
00:59:58,765 --> 01:00:01,935
No, he's...
he's right.

670
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:06,023
I did not see because
I did not wish to see.

671
01:00:06,106 --> 01:00:09,026
Oh, you didn't see because
you didn't wish to see.

672
01:00:09,109 --> 01:00:12,154
Ah! Well, that makes everything
fine then, doesn't it?

673
01:00:12,237 --> 01:00:14,156
- Aaron!

674
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:16,658
You shame yourself.

675
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:21,663
Miriam.

676
01:00:23,749 --> 01:00:26,335
I'm so sorry.

677
01:00:35,093 --> 01:00:37,346
Moses,

678
01:00:37,429 --> 01:00:39,848
hear what I say.

679
01:00:39,932 --> 01:00:42,226
I have been a slave...

680
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:44,311
all my life,

681
01:00:44,436 --> 01:00:48,649
and God has never
answered my prayers until now.

682
01:00:48,774 --> 01:00:50,651
God saved you
from the river,

683
01:00:50,776 --> 01:00:53,654
He saved you
in all your wanderings,

684
01:00:53,779 --> 01:00:56,907
and even now He saves you
from the wrath of Pharaoh.

685
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:59,910
God will not abandon you,

686
01:01:01,411 --> 01:01:03,830
so don't you abandon us.

687
01:01:36,613 --> 01:01:38,991
Miriam.
Where are you going?

688
01:01:39,116 --> 01:01:40,993
M-Miriam.

689
01:01:54,673 --> 01:01:57,467
The ball disappears.
Where is it? In his hand.

690
01:02:01,096 --> 01:02:02,931
Rameses!

691
01:02:04,266 --> 01:02:06,977
Let my people go!

692
01:02:09,104 --> 01:02:12,024
Still gnawing away
at that bone, are we?

693
01:02:12,107 --> 01:02:13,650
Carry on.

694
01:02:13,775 --> 01:02:15,903
You cannot
keep ignoring us.

695
01:02:16,028 --> 01:02:20,157
Enough! I will hear no more
of this Hebrew nonsense.

696
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,159
Bring him to me.

697
01:02:24,077 --> 01:02:26,163
- Moses!
- No!

698
01:02:39,468 --> 01:02:43,388
 Take the staff
in your hand, Moses.

699
01:03:11,917 --> 01:03:13,836
Father.

700
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:15,671
- It's...
- Blood!

701
01:03:15,754 --> 01:03:18,173
 Blood! Oh, blood!

702
01:03:29,142 --> 01:03:32,896
Hotep! Huy!
Explain this to me!

703
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:35,440
- Ah!
- Rest assured, Your Majesty...

704
01:03:35,524 --> 01:03:38,443
Uh, yes, we were going to
demonstrate the superior might...

705
01:03:38,527 --> 01:03:40,445
of our gods.

706
01:03:40,529 --> 01:03:42,030
Uh...

707
01:03:43,824 --> 01:03:46,660
By the power of Ra!

708
01:04:02,467 --> 01:04:05,387
Abandon this futile mission,
Moses.

709
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:08,724
I've indulged you
long enough.

710
01:04:08,807 --> 01:04:12,269
This must now
be finished.

711
01:04:14,521 --> 01:04:16,773
No, Rameses.

712
01:04:16,857 --> 01:04:19,109
It is only beginning.

713
01:04:19,234 --> 01:04:22,279
But, Moses, d-didn't you
see what happened?

714
01:04:22,404 --> 01:04:25,115
The priests
did the same thing.

715
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:28,160
Pharaoh still has the power
over our lives.

716
01:04:30,913 --> 01:04:34,333
Yes, Aaron, it's true.
Pharaoh has the power.

717
01:04:35,834 --> 01:04:41,298
He can take away your food,
your home, your freedom.

718
01:04:41,381 --> 01:04:45,969
He can take away
your sons and daughters.

719
01:04:46,053 --> 01:04:48,305
With one word,

720
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:51,350
Pharaoh can take away
your very lives.

721
01:04:53,393 --> 01:04:57,272
But there is one thing
he cannot take away from you:

722
01:04:57,356 --> 01:04:59,274
your faith.

723
01:05:01,735 --> 01:05:03,654
Believe,

724
01:05:03,737 --> 01:05:06,448
for we will see
God's wonders.

725
01:05:17,209 --> 01:05:18,502
# Thus saith the Lord ##

726
01:05:18,585 --> 01:05:20,838
#Since you refuse
to free my people ##

727
01:05:20,921 --> 01:05:24,007
-##Since you refuse to free my people ##
-##Since you refuse ##

728
01:05:24,132 --> 01:05:26,260
#All through
the land of Egypt ##

729
01:05:26,385 --> 01:05:28,971
#I send a pestilence, a plague ##

730
01:05:29,054 --> 01:05:30,347
-##Into your house, into your bed ##

731
01:05:30,472 --> 01:05:32,474
-##Into your streams
Into your streets ##
- Hmm.

732
01:05:32,558 --> 01:05:34,560
#Into your drink
Into your bread ##

733
01:05:34,643 --> 01:05:36,728
-##Upon your cattle, on your sheep ##

734
01:05:36,854 --> 01:05:38,856
#Upon your oxen
in your field ##

735
01:05:38,939 --> 01:05:40,899
-##Into your dreams, into your sleep ##

736
01:05:41,024 --> 01:05:43,777
#Until you break
Until you yield ##

737
01:05:43,902 --> 01:05:45,946
-##I send the swarm ##

738
01:05:46,071 --> 01:05:51,702
#I send the horde
Thus saith the Lord ##

739
01:05:52,911 --> 01:05:54,913
 ##Once I called you brother ##

740
01:05:54,997 --> 01:05:58,166
#Once I thought the chance
to make you laugh ##

741
01:05:58,250 --> 01:05:59,877
-## Was all I ever wanted ##

742
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,337
 ##I send the thunder
from the sky ##

743
01:06:02,421 --> 01:06:03,922
#I send the fire
raining down ##

744
01:06:04,006 --> 01:06:07,509
 ##And even now I wish
that God had chose another ##

745
01:06:07,593 --> 01:06:10,387
#Serving as your foe
on His behalf ##

746
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:12,097
#Is the last thing##

747
01:06:12,222 --> 01:06:14,099
-## That I wanted ##
##I send a hail of burning ice ##

748
01:06:14,224 --> 01:06:16,852
#On every field
On every town ##

749
01:06:16,935 --> 01:06:19,271
 ## This was my home ##

750
01:06:19,396 --> 01:06:24,401
#All this pain and devastation
how it tortures me inside ##

751
01:06:24,484 --> 01:06:26,737
#All the innocent
who suffer ##

752
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:28,447
#From your stubbornness ##

753
01:06:28,572 --> 01:06:30,699
-##And pride ##
- ##I send
the locusts on the wind ##

754
01:06:30,782 --> 01:06:32,701
#Such as the world
has never seen ##

755
01:06:32,784 --> 01:06:34,786
#On every leaf
On every stalk ##

756
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:36,538
#Until there's nothing left
of green ##

757
01:06:36,622 --> 01:06:41,043
#I send my scourge
I send my sword ##

758
01:06:41,126 --> 01:06:42,669
# Thus saith the Lord ##

759
01:06:42,794 --> 01:06:44,421
 ## You who I called brother ##

760
01:06:44,546 --> 01:06:47,257
# Why must you call down another blow ##

761
01:06:47,382 --> 01:06:51,678
 ##I send my scourge
I send my sword ##

762
01:06:51,803 --> 01:06:55,057
- ##Let my people go ##
- ## Thus saith the Lord ##

763
01:06:55,140 --> 01:07:01,772
# Thus saith the Lord ##

764
01:07:05,484 --> 01:07:07,361
# You who I called brother ##

765
01:07:07,486 --> 01:07:10,405
#How could you have come
to hate me so ##

766
01:07:10,489 --> 01:07:12,032
#Is this what you wanted ##

767
01:07:12,157 --> 01:07:15,786
 ##I sent the swarm
I sent the horde ##

768
01:07:15,911 --> 01:07:17,454
 ## Then let my heart
be hardened ##

769
01:07:17,538 --> 01:07:20,290
#And never mind
how high the cost may grow ##

770
01:07:20,415 --> 01:07:22,626
# This will still be so ##

771
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:24,753
#I will never let ##

772
01:07:24,837 --> 01:07:28,549
# Your people go ##

773
01:07:28,674 --> 01:07:30,801
 ## Thus saith the Lord ##

774
01:07:30,884 --> 01:07:32,886
 ## Thus saith the Lord ##

775
01:07:33,011 --> 01:07:36,223
- ##I will not let ##
- ##Let ##

776
01:07:36,348 --> 01:07:40,644
-## Your people ##
-##My people ##

777
01:07:40,727 --> 01:07:45,274
-##Go ####
-##Go ####

778
01:08:32,362 --> 01:08:34,448
Rameses?

779
01:08:36,617 --> 01:08:38,660
Rameses?

780
01:08:38,744 --> 01:08:40,704
 Oh. Let me guess.

781
01:08:42,414 --> 01:08:44,708
You want me to...

782
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:47,711
let your people go.

783
01:08:50,631 --> 01:08:53,050
I hoped
I would find you here.

784
01:08:53,133 --> 01:08:55,552
- Get out!

785
01:08:57,262 --> 01:09:01,808
Rameses, we must
bring this to an end.

786
01:09:07,022 --> 01:09:10,734
Rameses, please,
talk to me.

787
01:09:10,817 --> 01:09:13,403
We could always
talk here.

788
01:09:22,788 --> 01:09:24,706
This place.

789
01:09:26,333 --> 01:09:28,252
So many memories.

790
01:09:31,672 --> 01:09:34,299
I remember the time you...

791
01:09:34,424 --> 01:09:37,803
switched the heads of the gods
of the temple of Ra.

792
01:09:41,807 --> 01:09:43,725
If I recall correctly,

793
01:09:43,809 --> 01:09:48,105
you were there switching heads
right along with me.

794
01:09:49,231 --> 01:09:51,733
No, it was you.
I didn't do that.

795
01:09:51,817 --> 01:09:53,735
Oh, yes, you did.

796
01:09:53,819 --> 01:09:56,446
You put the hippo on the crocodile,
and the crocodile...

797
01:09:56,530 --> 01:09:58,448
- On the falcon.
- Yes!

798
01:09:58,532 --> 01:10:01,952
The priest thought it was a horrible
omen and fasted for two months.

799
01:10:02,035 --> 01:10:05,247
Father was furious. You were
always getting me into trouble.

800
01:10:12,546 --> 01:10:14,464
But then...

801
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:19,469
you were always there
to...

802
01:10:19,553 --> 01:10:22,890
get me out of trouble
again.

803
01:10:23,015 --> 01:10:24,892
Hmmph.

804
01:10:29,438 --> 01:10:32,858
Why can't things be
the way they were before?

805
01:10:34,443 --> 01:10:36,111
Father.

806
01:10:36,195 --> 01:10:38,113
It's so dark.

807
01:10:39,573 --> 01:10:41,825
I'm frightened.

808
01:10:42,951 --> 01:10:44,745
Why is he here?

809
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:51,460
Isn't that the man
who did all this?

810
01:10:53,378 --> 01:10:55,797
Yes.

811
01:10:55,881 --> 01:10:58,759
But one must wonder...

812
01:10:58,884 --> 01:11:00,761
why.

813
01:11:00,886 --> 01:11:05,891
Because no kingdom should be made
on the backs of slaves.

814
01:11:06,016 --> 01:11:10,187
Rameses, your stubbornness
is bringing this misery upon Egypt.

815
01:11:10,312 --> 01:11:13,649
It would cease if only you
would let the Hebrews go.

816
01:11:13,732 --> 01:11:16,652
I will not be dictated to.
I will not be threatened.

817
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:20,489
I am the morning
and the evening star. I am Pharaoh.

818
01:11:20,572 --> 01:11:24,660
Something else is coming. Something
much worse than anything before.

819
01:11:24,743 --> 01:11:27,663
Please, let go of
your contempt for life...

820
01:11:27,746 --> 01:11:30,874
before it destroys
everything you hold dear.

821
01:11:30,999 --> 01:11:33,043
Think of your son!

822
01:11:33,126 --> 01:11:35,045
I do.

823
01:11:35,128 --> 01:11:38,215
You Hebrews have been
nothing but trouble.

824
01:11:38,298 --> 01:11:41,844
My father had the right idea
about how to deal with your people.

825
01:11:41,927 --> 01:11:45,889
- Rameses...
- And I think it's time
I finished the job.

826
01:11:45,973 --> 01:11:50,227
- Rameses!
- And there shall be a great cry
in all of Egypt...

827
01:11:50,352 --> 01:11:53,397
such as never has been
or ever will be again!

828
01:12:08,287 --> 01:12:11,665
Rameses, you bring this
upon yourself.

829
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:24,553
 God has come
to me again, saying,

830
01:12:24,636 --> 01:12:26,513
"Take a lamb...

831
01:12:26,638 --> 01:12:29,266
and with its blood...

832
01:12:29,349 --> 01:12:33,061
mark the lintel and posts
of every door,

833
01:12:35,522 --> 01:12:38,442
for tonight...

834
01:12:38,525 --> 01:12:42,905
I shall pass through
the land of Egypt...

835
01:12:42,988 --> 01:12:46,074
and smite
all the firstborn.

836
01:12:52,206 --> 01:12:55,626
But when I see the blood
upon your door...

837
01:12:57,294 --> 01:12:59,671
I will pass over you,

838
01:13:01,673 --> 01:13:05,093
and the plague
shall not enter."

839
01:15:41,834 --> 01:15:45,712
You
and your people...

840
01:15:45,838 --> 01:15:48,924
have my permission to go.

841
01:15:53,846 --> 01:15:55,764
Leave me!

842
01:17:29,775 --> 01:17:33,320
# Many nights we've prayed #

843
01:17:33,445 --> 01:17:35,739
# With no proof #

844
01:17:35,864 --> 01:17:38,700
# Anyone could hear #

845
01:17:38,784 --> 01:17:42,538
#In our hearts
a hopeful song #

846
01:17:42,621 --> 01:17:47,084
# We barely understood #

847
01:17:47,167 --> 01:17:51,547
#Now we are not afraid ##

848
01:17:51,630 --> 01:17:56,468
#Although we know
there's much to fear ##

849
01:17:56,593 --> 01:17:59,972
# We were moving mountains ##

850
01:18:00,055 --> 01:18:06,019
#Long before
we knew we could ##

851
01:18:06,144 --> 01:18:09,982
# There can be miracles ##

852
01:18:10,107 --> 01:18:13,986
# When you believe #

853
01:18:14,069 --> 01:18:17,239
# Though hope is frail ##

854
01:18:17,322 --> 01:18:20,242
#It's hard to kill ##

855
01:18:22,119 --> 01:18:26,081
# Who knows what miracles ##

856
01:18:26,164 --> 01:18:29,960
# You can achieve #

857
01:18:30,085 --> 01:18:33,046
# When you believe #

858
01:18:33,172 --> 01:18:38,177
#Somehow you will #

859
01:18:38,302 --> 01:18:41,597
# You will when you ##

860
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:44,766
#Believe ##

861
01:18:46,101 --> 01:18:49,813
#In this time of fear #

862
01:18:49,938 --> 01:18:54,067
# When prayers so often
proved in vain #

863
01:18:54,193 --> 01:18:57,654
# Hope seemed like
the summer birds #

864
01:18:57,779 --> 01:19:01,617
# Too swiftly flown away ##

865
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:05,787
- # Yet now I'm standing here #
- # Now I'm standing here #

866
01:19:05,871 --> 01:19:10,167
# With heart so full
I can't explain #

867
01:19:10,292 --> 01:19:13,837
 #Seeking faith
and speaking words #

868
01:19:13,962 --> 01:19:18,091
#I never thought I'd say #

869
01:19:18,217 --> 01:19:22,679
# There can be miracles ##
