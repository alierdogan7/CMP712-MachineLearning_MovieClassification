00:02:38,304 --> 00:02:40,898
[Hubbub]

2
00:02:40,973 --> 00:02:43,771
[Munches]

3
00:02:43,843 --> 00:02:48,473
- Ah. It was a fine meal.
- Yes, it was, wasn't it?

4
00:02:48,547 --> 00:02:50,139
Yes, what should we do now?

5
00:02:50,216 --> 00:02:53,982
- Let's have lunch.
- Oh, good idea.

6
00:02:54,053 --> 00:02:56,021
Quiet down, you villains.

7
00:02:56,088 --> 00:02:58,648
[Pumpkin] I'm being stolen.
Help me, help me!

8
00:02:58,724 --> 00:03:00,589
[Pumpkin] Put me down!

9
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,094
[Children chatter]

10
00:03:03,162 --> 00:03:04,390
Hello.

11
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:07,088
[Dog barks]

12
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:12,366
What about my nose?

13
00:03:12,438 --> 00:03:13,427
[Yelps]

14
00:03:14,974 --> 00:03:17,568
[Woman, cackling]
Banana peels coming down!

15
00:03:19,912 --> 00:03:22,904
Come along, ladies.
Here's a nice Christmas turkey.

16
00:03:22,982 --> 00:03:25,746
Turkey.
Get your Christmas turkey.

17
00:03:25,818 --> 00:03:29,049
Hey, get back in the box, Martin!

18
00:03:29,121 --> 00:03:33,023
Get your boomerang fish.
Guaranteed fresh.

19
00:03:33,092 --> 00:03:37,085
Throw the fish away
and it comes back to me.

20
00:03:37,163 --> 00:03:38,926
Get 'em while they're fresh.

21
00:03:38,998 --> 00:03:41,091
- Christmas apples.
- We got Macintosh.

22
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:43,135
- Christmas apples.
- Red Delicious.

23
00:03:43,202 --> 00:03:45,102
Tuppence apiece, while they last.

24
00:03:45,171 --> 00:03:48,368
We... They won't last long
the way you're eating them.

25
00:03:48,441 --> 00:03:51,205
I'm creating scarcity.
Drives the prices up.

26
00:03:51,277 --> 00:03:53,211
- Rizzo...
- [Rizzo clears throat]

27
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:57,181
Hello. Welcome to
the Muppet Christmas Carol.

28
00:03:57,249 --> 00:03:58,978
I am here to tell the story.

29
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:00,814
And I am here for the food.

30
00:04:00,886 --> 00:04:02,683
My name is Charles Dickens.

31
00:04:02,755 --> 00:04:04,746
And my name is Rizzo the Rat.

32
00:04:04,824 --> 00:04:07,520
Wait a second,
you're not Charles Dickens.

33
00:04:07,593 --> 00:04:08,821
I am, too.

34
00:04:08,894 --> 00:04:11,886
A blue furry Charles Dickens
who hangs out with a rat?

35
00:04:11,964 --> 00:04:13,090
Absolutely.

36
00:04:13,165 --> 00:04:15,963
Charles Dickens
was a 19th century novelist.

37
00:04:16,035 --> 00:04:17,263
A genius.

38
00:04:17,336 --> 00:04:19,133
You are too kind.

39
00:04:19,205 --> 00:04:21,105
Why should I believe you?

40
00:04:21,173 --> 00:04:24,768
Because I know the story of <i>A Christmas</i>
<i>Carol like the back of my hand.</i>

41
00:04:24,844 --> 00:04:27,039
- Prove it.
- All right.

42
00:04:27,113 --> 00:04:29,479
There's a little mole on my thumb.

43
00:04:29,548 --> 00:04:33,040
And a scar on my wrist
from when I fell off my bicycle...

44
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:36,054
No, don't tell us your hand,
tell us the story.

45
00:04:36,122 --> 00:04:38,215
Oh, thank you. Yes.

46
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,418
The Marleys were dead,
to begin with.

47
00:04:41,494 --> 00:04:42,688
The... Pardon me?

48
00:04:42,762 --> 00:04:44,491
That's how the story begins,

49
00:04:44,563 --> 00:04:46,963
"The Marleys were dead,
to begin with."

50
00:04:47,032 --> 00:04:49,466
As dead as a doornail.

51
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,936
It's a good beginning.
It's creepy and kind of... spooky.

52
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:55,701
- Thank you, Rizzo.
- You're welcome, Mr. Dickens.

53
00:04:55,775 --> 00:04:58,539
In life, the Marleys had been
business partners

54
00:04:58,611 --> 00:05:03,014
with a shrewd moneylender
named Ebenezer Scrooge.

55
00:05:03,082 --> 00:05:06,176
You will meet him
as he comes around that corner.

56
00:05:06,252 --> 00:05:07,549
- Where?
- There.

57
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,713
- When?
- Now.

58
00:05:11,657 --> 00:05:15,115
[Dickens] There he is,
Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge.

59
00:05:19,198 --> 00:05:22,497
Say, is it getting cold around here?
[Shudders]

60
00:05:27,973 --> 00:05:30,771
<i>When a cold wind blows,</i>
<i>it chills you</i>

61
00:05:30,843 --> 00:05:32,834
<i>Chills you to the bone</i>

62
00:05:32,912 --> 00:05:35,403
<i>But there's nothing in nature</i>
<i>that freezes your heart</i>

63
00:05:35,481 --> 00:05:37,472
<i>Like years of being alone</i>

64
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,348
<i>It paints you with indifference</i>

65
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:42,751
<i>Like a lady paints with rouge</i>

66
00:05:42,822 --> 00:05:45,256
<i>And the worst of the worst,</i>
<i>the most hated and cursed</i>

67
00:05:45,324 --> 00:05:47,656
<i>Is the one that we call Scrooge</i>

68
00:05:47,726 --> 00:05:50,160
- <i>Unkind as any</i>
- <i>And the wrath of many</i>

69
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:52,254
<i>This is Ebenezer Scrooge</i>

70
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:57,268
<i>There goes Mr. Humbug</i>
<i>There goes Mr. Grim</i>

71
00:05:57,336 --> 00:05:59,964
<i>If they gave a prize for being mean</i>

72
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:02,132
<i>The winner would be him</i>

73
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,233
<i>Old Scrooge, he loves his money</i>

74
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,074
<i>'Cause he thinks it gives him power</i>

75
00:06:07,146 --> 00:06:13,176
<i>If he became a flavor</i>
<i>You can bet he would be sour</i>

76
00:06:13,252 --> 00:06:15,516
Even the vegetables don't like him.

77
00:06:17,256 --> 00:06:21,716
<i>There goes Mr. Skinflint</i>
<i>There goes Mr. Greed</i>

78
00:06:22,194 --> 00:06:26,858
<i>The undisputed master</i>
<i>of the underhanded deed</i>

79
00:06:26,932 --> 00:06:28,991
<i>He charges folks a fortune</i>

80
00:06:29,068 --> 00:06:31,764
<i>For his dark and drafty houses</i>

81
00:06:31,837 --> 00:06:34,169
<i>Us poor folk live in misery</i>

82
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,732
<i>It's even worse for mouses</i>

83
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,337
Please, sir, I want some cheese.

84
00:06:41,413 --> 00:06:43,973
<i>He must be so lonely</i>

85
00:06:44,049 --> 00:06:46,347
<i>He must be so sad</i>

86
00:06:46,418 --> 00:06:51,185
<i>He goes to extremes</i>
<i>to convince us he's bad</i>

87
00:06:51,257 --> 00:06:53,748
<i>He's really a victim</i>

88
00:06:53,826 --> 00:06:56,226
<i>Of fear and of pride</i>

89
00:06:56,295 --> 00:07:01,927
<i>Look close and there must be</i>
<i>a sweet man inside</i>

90
00:07:02,735 --> 00:07:04,225
- Nah.
- Uh-uh.

91
00:07:04,303 --> 00:07:06,737
<i>There goes Mr. Outrage</i>

92
00:07:06,805 --> 00:07:09,273
<i>There goes Mr. Sneer</i>

93
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:11,571
<i>He has no time for friends or fun</i>

94
00:07:11,644 --> 00:07:13,771
<i>His anger makes that clear</i>

95
00:07:13,846 --> 00:07:18,613
<i>Don't ask him for a favor</i>
<i>'cause his nastiness increases</i>

96
00:07:18,684 --> 00:07:21,244
<i>No crust of bread for those in need</i>

97
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,187
<i>No cheeses for us "meeces"</i>

98
00:07:24,256 --> 00:07:25,985
Scrooge liked the cold.

99
00:07:26,058 --> 00:07:28,322
He was hard and sharp as a flint.

100
00:07:28,394 --> 00:07:30,225
Secret and self-contained.

101
00:07:30,296 --> 00:07:32,457
As solitary as an oyster.

102
00:07:32,531 --> 00:07:34,829
<i>There goes Mr. Heartless</i>

103
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,095
<i>There goes Mr. Cruel</i>

104
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:39,729
<i>He never gives</i>
<i>He only takes</i>

105
00:07:39,805 --> 00:07:42,000
<i>He lets his hunger rule</i>

106
00:07:42,074 --> 00:07:46,875
<i>If being mean's a way of life</i>
<i>you practice and rehearse</i>

107
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:49,414
<i>Then all that work is paying off</i>

108
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:52,143
<i>'Cause Scrooge is getting worse</i>

109
00:07:52,217 --> 00:07:56,881
<i>Every day, in every way</i>
<i>Scrooge is getting worse</i>

110
00:07:57,723 --> 00:07:59,748
- [male] Oh, boy.
- How the time flies.

111
00:07:59,825 --> 00:08:01,759
Look at this, I've got to move...

112
00:08:01,827 --> 00:08:03,488
[horse brays]

113
00:08:05,664 --> 00:08:06,995
Humbug.

114
00:08:13,205 --> 00:08:16,971
Phew! What an unpleasant fellow.

115
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:22,446
He was a tightfisted hand
at the grindstone, Scroo...

116
00:08:22,514 --> 00:08:24,982
Boy, this really is a dirty city.

117
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,416
Ha. You tellin' me.

118
00:08:28,253 --> 00:08:31,120
[Thud, squeaking]

119
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,818
Thank you for making me
a part of this.

120
00:08:33,892 --> 00:08:37,828
He was a tightfisted hand
at the grindstone, Scrooge.

121
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:41,992
A squeezing, wrenching,
grasping, clutching...

122
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:44,365
covetous old sinner.

123
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:46,301
[Gulps]

124
00:08:46,372 --> 00:08:48,033
Bob Cratchit?

125
00:08:48,107 --> 00:08:49,301
Yes, Mr. Scrooge?

126
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,104
Who is this?

127
00:08:51,176 --> 00:08:52,803
Mr. Applegate, sir.

128
00:08:52,878 --> 00:08:55,506
He's here to speak to you
about his... mortgage.

129
00:08:55,581 --> 00:08:57,913
Mr. Scrooge,
I know you're very angry about this,

130
00:08:57,983 --> 00:09:00,508
and I didn't mean to
fall behind in the payment.

131
00:09:00,586 --> 00:09:02,952
Lord knows,
it being Christmas and all.

132
00:09:03,022 --> 00:09:05,115
Please don't shout at me, sir.

133
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,216
That and, of course, little Gwen.
Her lungs aren't right.

134
00:09:08,293 --> 00:09:10,557
The doctor takes his share, don't he?

135
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:12,722
You can yell and scream,
and you're right,

136
00:09:12,798 --> 00:09:14,561
but it won't do no good...

137
00:09:14,633 --> 00:09:17,295
because I'm the stone
you can't squeeze blood from.

138
00:09:17,369 --> 00:09:19,633
And that's the truth!

139
00:09:19,705 --> 00:09:22,003
[Applegate]
Thank you for not shouting at me.

140
00:09:22,074 --> 00:09:24,941
- [Door slams]
- [Workers] 17... 42...

141
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:28,468
Let us deal with the eviction notices
for tomorrow, Mr. Cratchit.

142
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:30,378
Uh...

143
00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:31,916
Tomorrow's Christmas, sir.

144
00:09:31,984 --> 00:09:35,784
Very well, you may gift wrap them.

145
00:09:35,854 --> 00:09:38,345
[Worker] Let us help you with that,
Mr. Cratchit.

146
00:09:38,424 --> 00:09:40,688
My, there are certainly a lot today.

147
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:41,748
We'll get it.

148
00:09:41,827 --> 00:09:44,057
I'm okay, okay.

149
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:46,063
- Here you go.
- Look out on that end...

150
00:09:46,131 --> 00:09:48,156
[clamoring]

151
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:50,167
- Uh...
- [workers] Whoa!

152
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,698
Christmas is a very busy time for us,
Mr. Cratchit.

153
00:09:54,773 --> 00:09:58,004
People preparing feasts, giving parties.

154
00:09:58,077 --> 00:10:01,604
Spending the mortgage money
on frivolities.

155
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,377
One might say that December
is the foreclosure season.

156
00:10:05,451 --> 00:10:09,854
Harvest time for the moneylenders.

157
00:10:09,922 --> 00:10:11,446
- Boss, ask him.
- Tell him.

158
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:14,754
- Come on. Come on.
- Do it now. Do it.

159
00:10:14,827 --> 00:10:17,694
If you please, Mr. Scrooge,
it's gotten colder.

160
00:10:17,763 --> 00:10:21,494
The bookkeeping staff would like to have
an extra shovel of coal for the fire.

161
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,593
- We can't do the bookkeeping.
- Our pens are like ink-cicles.

162
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,501
Our assets are frozen.

163
00:10:26,572 --> 00:10:30,372
How would the bookkeepers
like to be suddenly unemployed?

164
00:10:30,442 --> 00:10:32,273
[All] Heat wave!

165
00:10:32,344 --> 00:10:35,802
[All sing]
This is my island in the sun!

166
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:39,214
I, I believe you've convinced them
once again, Mr. Scrooge.

167
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:45,219
At that moment,
who should arrive at the door

168
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:49,386
but Scrooge's nephew, Fred.
His only living relative.

169
00:10:49,461 --> 00:10:51,952
- Nephew Fred? I don't see him.
- Trust me.

170
00:10:53,465 --> 00:10:55,592
Hello? Uncle?

171
00:10:57,803 --> 00:10:58,792
Rizzo?

172
00:10:58,871 --> 00:11:01,305
You're very good at that, Mr. Dickens.

173
00:11:01,373 --> 00:11:04,638
A merry Christmas, Uncle Scrooge.
God save you.

174
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,302
Merry Christmas?

175
00:11:06,378 --> 00:11:08,642
Bah. Humbug!

176
00:11:08,714 --> 00:11:10,705
Quick, it'll be warmer in there.

177
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:18,550
Christmas a humbug, Uncle?
You don't mean that, surely.

178
00:11:18,624 --> 00:11:20,649
Actually, I think it's colder in here.

179
00:11:20,726 --> 00:11:23,627
Merry Christmas, you say?
What right have you to be merry?

180
00:11:23,695 --> 00:11:25,185
You're poor enough.

181
00:11:25,264 --> 00:11:27,425
And you to be dismal?
You're rich enough.

182
00:11:27,499 --> 00:11:29,660
He's got him.
The old boy's speechless.

183
00:11:29,735 --> 00:11:31,794
If I could work my will,

184
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:35,033
every idiot who goes about with
"Merry Christmas" on his lips

185
00:11:35,107 --> 00:11:36,938
would be cooked with his own turkey

186
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:40,069
and buried with a stake of holly
through his heart.

187
00:11:40,145 --> 00:11:41,976
Well, not quite speechless.

188
00:11:42,047 --> 00:11:43,537
- Uncle...
- Nephew.

189
00:11:43,615 --> 00:11:47,483
You keep Christmas in your own way,
and let me keep it in mine.

190
00:11:47,553 --> 00:11:51,489
Christmas is a loving,
honest and charitable time.

191
00:11:51,557 --> 00:11:55,084
And though it's never put
a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket,

192
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,890
I believe Christmas has done me good
and will do me good,

193
00:11:57,963 --> 00:11:59,624
and I say, God bless it.

194
00:11:59,698 --> 00:12:01,495
[Workers cheer]

195
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:05,401
And how does one celebrate Christmas
on the unemployment line?

196
00:12:07,673 --> 00:12:10,642
Now, in these times,
it was customary on Christmas Eve

197
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:13,405
for well-meaning gentlemen
to call upon businesses,

198
00:12:13,478 --> 00:12:17,175
collecting donations
for the poor and homeless.

199
00:12:17,849 --> 00:12:19,874
Mr. Scrooge, I presume?

200
00:12:19,952 --> 00:12:21,385
[High-pitched squeak]

201
00:12:22,387 --> 00:12:23,581
Who are you?

202
00:12:23,655 --> 00:12:27,352
We're from the Order of Victoria
Charity Foundation.

203
00:12:27,426 --> 00:12:30,224
We'd like to speak to you
about a donation.

204
00:12:30,295 --> 00:12:32,229
Ah! Welcome!

205
00:12:32,297 --> 00:12:34,891
This jolly old gentleman here
is Mr. Scrooge.

206
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:37,333
He's very generous to charities.

207
00:12:37,402 --> 00:12:38,926
My dear nephew!

208
00:12:39,004 --> 00:12:42,064
At this festive season of the year,
Mr. Scrooge,

209
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,440
many of us feel we must
take care of our poor and homeless.

210
00:12:46,511 --> 00:12:49,071
Are there no prisons?
No poor houses?

211
00:12:49,147 --> 00:12:51,411
Oh, plenty of those, sir.

212
00:12:51,483 --> 00:12:53,144
Oh. Excellent.

213
00:12:53,218 --> 00:12:55,015
For a moment, I was worried.

214
00:12:55,087 --> 00:12:59,353
Some of us are endeavoring to raise
a fund for the poor and homeless.

215
00:12:59,424 --> 00:13:01,824
What might I put you down for?

216
00:13:01,893 --> 00:13:02,917
Nothing.

217
00:13:02,995 --> 00:13:07,056
- You wish to remain anonymous?
- I wish to be left alone.

218
00:13:07,132 --> 00:13:09,191
I do not make merry myself
for Christmas.

219
00:13:09,268 --> 00:13:10,360
That certainly is true.

220
00:13:10,502 --> 00:13:12,470
I cannot afford
to make idle people merry.

221
00:13:12,537 --> 00:13:14,095
That is certainly not true.

222
00:13:14,172 --> 00:13:16,800
Don't you have other things to do
this afternoon?

223
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:20,333
Sadly, I do, Uncle.
So I shall make my donation.

224
00:13:20,412 --> 00:13:23,040
And leave you to make yours.

225
00:13:23,115 --> 00:13:24,844
Thank you so very much.

226
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:29,080
Oh, Uncle, come and have Christmas
dinner with me and Clara tomorrow.

227
00:13:29,154 --> 00:13:30,985
Why ever did you get married?

228
00:13:31,056 --> 00:13:33,081
Why? Because I fell in love.

229
00:13:33,158 --> 00:13:35,183
[Laughs]

230
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,525
That's the only thing in the world
sillier than a merry Christmas.

231
00:13:38,597 --> 00:13:41,464
It's no use, I shall keep
my Christmas humor to the last.

232
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:44,969
A merry Christmas to you.
And a happy New Year.

233
00:13:45,037 --> 00:13:47,437
- Merry Christmas, Fred.
- Merry Christmas, Bob.

234
00:13:47,506 --> 00:13:48,837
Humbug!

235
00:13:50,075 --> 00:13:51,838
[Softly] Ahem.

236
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,310
[Clock ticks]

237
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:03,083
Now, then, sir, about the...

238
00:14:03,155 --> 00:14:04,850
donation.

239
00:14:05,557 --> 00:14:07,422
Well, now.

240
00:14:07,492 --> 00:14:09,221
Let's see.

241
00:14:10,462 --> 00:14:13,454
I know how to treat the poor.

242
00:14:13,532 --> 00:14:16,968
My taxes go to pay for the prisons
and the poorhouses.

243
00:14:17,035 --> 00:14:19,799
- The homeless must go there.
- But some would rather die.

244
00:14:19,871 --> 00:14:22,465
If they'd rather die,
then they'd better do it,

245
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,532
and decrease the surplus population.

246
00:14:24,609 --> 00:14:27,271
- [Squeaks]
- Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

247
00:14:27,346 --> 00:14:31,248
This is the door, you may use it.

248
00:14:31,316 --> 00:14:33,181
All right, Beaker, come along.

249
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:37,187
I think we've taken enough
of Mr. Scrooge's time.

250
00:14:37,255 --> 00:14:40,156
- [Beaker squeaks]
- Oh, dear. Dear, dear.

251
00:14:40,225 --> 00:14:43,888
- [Door slams]
- [Workers] 17... 24... 58.

- What do you want?
- Uh... Penny for the song, guvnor?

258
00:15:05,784 --> 00:15:07,081
[Gasps]

259
00:15:07,619 --> 00:15:09,143
Wh... Ow!

260
00:15:09,888 --> 00:15:11,014
[Groans]

00:15:12,224 --> 00:15:13,919
[Worker] 17... 24...

262
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:32,738
[clears throat] Excuse me, Mr. Scrooge,
but it appears to be closing time.

263
00:15:33,912 --> 00:15:38,076
Very well. I'll see you
at eight tomorrow morning.

264
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:40,682
[Workers] Ask him, ask him.

265
00:15:40,752 --> 00:15:42,549
Um... Tomorrow's Christmas.

266
00:15:42,621 --> 00:15:44,919
- 8:30, then.
- [Workers sigh]

267
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,389
If you please, sir,

268
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:49,359
half an hour off hardly seems customary
for Christmas Day.

269
00:15:49,428 --> 00:15:52,363
- [Worker] No.
- [Worker 2] Hardly customary.

270
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:55,195
How much time off is customary,
Mr. Cratchit?

271
00:15:55,267 --> 00:15:58,862
Um... Why, um, the, er, whole day.

272
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:00,802
- Yeah, that's right.
- The whole day.

273
00:16:00,872 --> 00:16:02,237
The entire day?

274
00:16:02,307 --> 00:16:04,332
- No.
- That's the frog's idea.

275
00:16:04,409 --> 00:16:07,503
If you please,
why open the office tomorrow?

276
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:11,071
Other businesses will be closed.
You'll have no one to do business with.

277
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:14,607
It'll waste a lot of expensive coal
for the fire.

278
00:16:14,686 --> 00:16:17,849
- That's definitely a point.
- That's a point.

279
00:16:17,923 --> 00:16:21,654
It's a poor excuse for picking
a man's pocket every December the 25th.

280
00:16:21,726 --> 00:16:24,422
[All groan]

281
00:16:24,496 --> 00:16:27,727
But as I seem to be
the only person around who knows that...

282
00:16:29,034 --> 00:16:31,730
...take the day off.
- [All cheer]

283
00:16:36,241 --> 00:16:38,471
- Will you stop that?
- [Workers yelp]

284
00:16:39,878 --> 00:16:41,869
Thank you, Mr. Scrooge.

285
00:16:43,582 --> 00:16:45,550
Be here all the earlier
the next morning.

286
00:16:45,617 --> 00:16:48,245
- [Worker] Okay.
- [Worker 2] You bet. First thing.

287
00:16:51,556 --> 00:16:53,717
With their employer gone at last,

288
00:16:53,792 --> 00:16:56,420
Bob Cratchit and the bookkeepers
immediately began

289
00:16:56,495 --> 00:17:01,330
that most pleasant of activities,
the celebration of Christmas.

290
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:04,368
- He's gone!
- [Workers cheer]

291

<i>Today, the world has got a glow</i>

That's it. Ha! Ha!

307
00:18:20,245 --> 00:18:22,236
- [Others cheer]
- Mm-hm.

308
00:18:24,282 --> 00:18:26,443
Very good, gentlemen.

- Look at that!

You did good, boss.

318
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:23,064
Oh, thank you.
Thank you very much.

319
00:19:27,579 --> 00:19:29,547
Wow!

320
00:19:29,614 --> 00:19:31,844
- No way.
- Come on, Rizzo.

00:19:41,393 --> 00:19:42,690

[Dog barks]

335
00:20:37,148 --> 00:20:39,878
Scrooge lived in chambers
which had once belonged

336
00:20:39,951 --> 00:20:43,045
to his old business partners,
Jacob and Robert Marley.

337
00:20:43,121 --> 00:20:45,146
- Have some bread?
- Not while I'm working.

338
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:47,191
Suit yourself.

339
00:20:47,258 --> 00:20:51,217
The building was a dismal heap of brick
on a dark street.

340
00:20:51,296 --> 00:20:54,561
Once again, you must remember
that the Marleys were dead

341
00:20:54,632 --> 00:20:57,396
- and decaying in their graves.
- Yeuch!

342
00:20:57,469 --> 00:20:59,699
[Whispers] That one thing
you must remember,

343
00:20:59,771 --> 00:21:02,205
or nothing that follows
will seem wondrous.

344
00:21:02,273 --> 00:21:03,797
Why are you whispering?

345
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,070
- It's for dramatic emphasis.
- Oh.

346
00:21:06,144 --> 00:21:07,577
Shh.

347
00:21:31,469 --> 00:21:32,800
Jacob Marley?

348
00:21:32,871 --> 00:21:35,066
[Booming groan]

349
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:39,933
You okay?

350
00:21:50,989 --> 00:21:52,320
Humbug.

351
00:21:55,326 --> 00:21:57,794
Oh. Gonzo, speak to me.

352
00:21:57,862 --> 00:22:01,696
I mean, Mr. Dickens.
Charlie! Are you hurt?

353
00:22:01,766 --> 00:22:04,929
To say that Scrooge
was not startled would be untrue.

354
00:22:05,003 --> 00:22:08,439
Still, the moment had passed,
and the world was as it should be.

355
00:22:08,506 --> 00:22:11,066
He ain't hurt.
Didn't even break his concentration.

356
00:22:11,142 --> 00:22:12,871
- Hmm?
- Nothing.

357
00:22:17,615 --> 00:22:20,345
Come on, Rizzo.
We'll follow him in.

358
00:22:20,418 --> 00:22:24,013
In a minute.
I had a bag of jelly beans over here.

359
00:22:24,088 --> 00:22:25,817
Will you just get over here?

360
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:28,051
- All right.
- Sheesh.

361
00:22:29,494 --> 00:22:31,621
- [Dickens groans]
- Oh-oh.

362
00:22:33,364 --> 00:22:34,490
Steady, steady.

363
00:22:34,566 --> 00:22:37,034
[Strangulated]
Scrooge made his way up the stairs,

364
00:22:37,101 --> 00:22:39,092
caring not a button for the darkness.

365
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:41,730
Darkness was cheap,
and Scrooge liked it.

366
00:22:43,908 --> 00:22:47,639
<i>But the incident at the door</i>
<i>had made Scrooge wary.</i>

367
00:22:47,712 --> 00:22:52,046
<i>Before he shut himself in for the night,</i>
<i>he searched his rooms.</i>

368
00:22:52,116 --> 00:22:54,550
<i>- [Rizzo] Okay, that does it.</i>
<i>- [Dickens] Pardon?</i>

369
00:22:54,619 --> 00:22:56,883
How do you know
what Scrooge is doing?

370
00:22:56,955 --> 00:22:59,150
We're down here and he's up there.

371
00:22:59,224 --> 00:23:02,990
I keep telling you, storytellers
are omniscient. I know everything.

372
00:23:03,061 --> 00:23:05,962
Hoity-toity, Mr. Godlike Smarty-Pants.

373
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:12,292
To conduct a proper search,
Scrooge was forced to light the lamps.

374
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:15,767
How does he do that?

375
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,598
Agh!

376
00:23:58,616 --> 00:23:59,913
Oh.

377
00:24:01,052 --> 00:24:03,384
It's my best dressing gown.

378
00:24:06,758 --> 00:24:08,851
No harm done.

Look, it's Ebenezer Scrooge.

387
00:25:25,003 --> 00:25:27,733
Looking older and more wicked
than ever.

388
00:25:27,805 --> 00:25:29,864

Who are you?

391
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,848
In life, we were your partners,

392
00:25:37,915 --> 00:25:41,180
- Jacob...
- And Robert Marley.

393
00:25:41,252 --> 00:25:43,379
It looks like you.

394
00:25:43,454 --> 00:25:47,390
- But I don't believe it.
- Why do you doubt your senses?

395
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:50,586
Because a little thing
can affect them.

396
00:25:50,661 --> 00:25:54,153
A slight disorder of the stomach
can make them cheat.

397
00:25:54,232 --> 00:25:58,100
You may be a bit of undigested beef.
A blob of mustard.

398
00:25:58,169 --> 00:25:59,966
A crumb of cheese.

399
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:03,667
Yes, there's more of gravy
than of grave about you.

401
00:26:06,344 --> 00:26:08,471
More of gravy than of grave?

402
00:26:08,546 --> 00:26:11,572
What a terrible pun.
Where do you get those jokes?

403
00:26:11,649 --> 00:26:13,810
Leave comedy to the bears, Ebenezer.

404
00:26:15,853 --> 00:26:19,812
Please, Jacob, Robert,
don't criticize me.

405
00:26:19,891 --> 00:26:21,654
You always criticized me.

406
00:26:21,726 --> 00:26:23,557
We were always heckling you.

407
00:26:23,628 --> 00:26:25,562
It's good to be heckling again.

408
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:27,791
It's good to be doing anything again.

409
00:26:29,834 --> 00:26:31,529
Why do you come to me?

<i>And if you could not pay the rent,</i>
<i>we simply threw you out</i>

414
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:54,582
There was the year
we evicted the entire orphanage.

415
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:58,857
I remember the little tykes
all standing in the snowbank.

416
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,763
With their little
frostbitten teddy bears.

But my friends, you were not unfeeling
towards your fellow men.

00:27:37,001 --> 00:27:40,266
True, there was something
about mankind we loved.

428
00:27:40,338 --> 00:27:42,101
I think it was their money.

- [Both wail]
- The chains.

437
00:28:09,033 --> 00:28:13,060

leaving him once again
alone in his room.

00:33:21,011 --> 00:33:23,309
[Spirit] It is the past.

523
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:29,078
Look, it's beautiful, Rizzo.

524
00:33:29,153 --> 00:33:31,451
[Rizzo] Mommy!

525
00:33:38,596 --> 00:33:40,587
Hey, we're going down.

526
00:33:41,198 --> 00:33:43,632
Hang on, Rizzo.

527
00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:46,397
- [Woman screams]
- [Dickens] Sorry, madam.

528
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,404
- [Man grunts]
- [Rizzo] Pardon me, sir.

529
00:33:48,472 --> 00:33:50,303
[Dickens] Look out, Rizzo.

530
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,503
Rizzo, this is Louise.

531
00:33:55,579 --> 00:33:57,570
Yeah, we've met.

532
00:34:06,757 --> 00:34:11,353
And so they arrived
in Ebenezer Scrooge's childhood.

533
00:34:11,428 --> 00:34:13,828
That was the worst trip of my life.

534
00:34:13,898 --> 00:34:15,263
It's over now.

535
00:34:15,332 --> 00:34:18,392
- Yeah, safe at last.
- [Meows]

536
00:34:19,236 --> 00:34:20,225
No.

537
00:34:20,938 --> 00:34:23,406
No. No! Oh, no!

538
00:34:23,474 --> 00:34:24,873
Nice kitty, nice kitty.

539
00:34:24,942 --> 00:34:26,967
Ow! I'm from New Jersey.

540
00:34:27,044 --> 00:34:28,739
[Cat meows, kids shout]

541
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,271
It was the afternoon of Christmas Eve,

542
00:34:32,349 --> 00:34:35,648
and Scrooge was conscious
of a thousand odors.

543
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:40,816
Each one connected with a thousand
thoughts, hopes, joys and cares,

544
00:34:40,891 --> 00:34:43,052
long, long forgotten.

545
00:34:45,229 --> 00:34:47,220
It's my old school.

546
00:34:48,165 --> 00:34:49,792
I was a boy here.

547
00:34:50,801 --> 00:34:53,429
That's Henry.

548
00:34:53,504 --> 00:34:55,768
And Edmund, my best friend.

549
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,467
Hello, boys. Hello.

550
00:34:58,542 --> 00:35:01,306
These are but shadows
of your past, Ebenezer.

551
00:35:01,378 --> 00:35:04,006
They can neither see nor hear you.

552
00:35:04,081 --> 00:35:06,413
Come, let us go inside.

553
00:35:08,786 --> 00:35:10,777
Rizzo, stop playing with the cat.

554
00:35:10,854 --> 00:35:13,550
- Save me, save me!
- [Cat meows viciously]

555
00:35:32,142 --> 00:35:35,578
And what a flood of memories
came back to him,

556
00:35:35,646 --> 00:35:38,774
as Scrooge beheld his old classroom.

557
00:35:39,817 --> 00:35:41,944
I know it all so well, spirit.

558
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,649
The desks.

559
00:35:45,856 --> 00:35:47,915
The smell of the chalk.

560
00:35:50,327 --> 00:35:52,522
I chose my profession in this room.

561
00:35:52,596 --> 00:35:55,326
And is he, too, familiar?

562
00:35:58,302 --> 00:36:01,965
[Dickens] Scrooge beheld a small boy,
a boy he knew,

563
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:04,507
oh, very well indeed.

564
00:36:07,444 --> 00:36:10,038
Good heavens.

565
00:36:10,114 --> 00:36:11,672
It's me.

566
00:36:11,749 --> 00:36:14,183
Come Ebenezer,
the last coach is leaving.

567
00:36:14,251 --> 00:36:16,549
Come on,
he never goes home for Christmas.

568
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,952
Who cares about stupid old Christmas?

569
00:36:20,924 --> 00:36:23,085
I was often alone.

570
00:36:24,294 --> 00:36:27,923
More time for reading... and study.

571
00:36:27,998 --> 00:36:31,934
The Christmas holiday was a chance
to get some extra work done.

572
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:35,834
A time for... solitude.

573
00:36:38,976 --> 00:36:41,342
Rats don't understand these things.

574
00:36:41,412 --> 00:36:43,539
You were never a lonely child?

575
00:36:43,614 --> 00:36:47,050
I had 1,274 brothers and sisters.

576
00:36:47,117 --> 00:36:51,110
Sheesh.
Rats don't understand these things.

577
00:36:51,188 --> 00:36:54,715
Let us see another Christmas
in this place.

578
00:36:54,792 --> 00:36:56,953
They were all very much the same.

579
00:36:59,396 --> 00:37:01,159
Nothing ever changed.

580
00:37:01,231 --> 00:37:03,324
You changed.

581
00:37:24,121 --> 00:37:26,817
[Dickens] The years performed
their terrible dance.

582
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:31,054
And in a moment, Scrooge had seen
his entire childhood pass.

583
00:37:31,128 --> 00:37:35,292
He saw his old school room
age and decay.

584
00:37:35,365 --> 00:37:37,196
What the... Hey!

585
00:37:37,267 --> 00:37:38,256
Agh!

586
00:37:38,335 --> 00:37:42,203
So, Master Scrooge, graduation day!

587
00:37:43,307 --> 00:37:46,470
That's my old headmaster.

588
00:37:46,543 --> 00:37:48,738
This man taught me my greatest lesson.

589
00:37:48,812 --> 00:37:52,270
Stand up. Build your life
as this school was built.

590
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:53,407
Push!

591
00:37:53,484 --> 00:37:55,475
[Strains] My ear, my ear, my ear.

592
00:37:57,488 --> 00:38:02,585
Yes, work hard, work long,
and be constructive.

593
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:05,594
Ebenezer, life is a golden opportunity.

594
00:38:05,662 --> 00:38:08,597
Today you go forth into the real world.

595
00:38:08,665 --> 00:38:11,566
You must keep your nose
to the grindstone.

596
00:38:11,635 --> 00:38:13,899
Work hard, lad. And one day,

597
00:38:13,971 --> 00:38:16,963
your life will be as solid
as this very building.

598
00:38:18,909 --> 00:38:21,469
Hmm. I've been meaning
to fix that shelf.

599
00:38:21,545 --> 00:38:22,773
Yes, headmaster.

600
00:38:22,846 --> 00:38:27,909
Young man, you have been apprenticed
to a fine company in London.

601
00:38:27,985 --> 00:38:31,944
Today, you become a man of business.

602
00:38:32,022 --> 00:38:34,013
I'm looking forward to it, headmaster.

603
00:38:34,091 --> 00:38:36,525
You will love business.

604
00:38:36,593 --> 00:38:38,857
It is the American way.

605
00:38:38,929 --> 00:38:39,918
Sam?

606
00:38:39,997 --> 00:38:42,465
- Mmm?
- [Whispers]

607
00:38:43,433 --> 00:38:46,095
Oh. It is the British way.

608
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,159
Good.

609
00:38:47,237 --> 00:38:49,102
Yes, headmaster.

610
00:38:53,043 --> 00:38:55,375
[Headmaster]
Oh, here is your coach, Ebenezer.

611
00:38:55,445 --> 00:38:58,778
Come, Scrooge, there is much to see.

612
00:39:00,484 --> 00:39:02,475
Remember, don't tip the driver.

613
00:39:11,061 --> 00:39:15,157
A moment later, Scrooge found himself
standing on a city street,

614
00:39:15,232 --> 00:39:19,328
looking at a building
he had not seen in years.

615
00:39:19,403 --> 00:39:22,566
Tell me, Ebenezer Scrooge,
do you know this place?

616
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:26,131
Know it? My first job was here.

617
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:28,872
This is Fozziwig's
old rubber chicken factory.

618
00:39:28,946 --> 00:39:30,743
Once again, it was Christmas Eve,

619
00:39:30,814 --> 00:39:35,877
night was falling, and the lamplighters
were plying their trade.

620
00:39:35,953 --> 00:39:39,411
Hey, light the lamp, not the rat.
Light the lamp, not the rat!

621
00:39:39,489 --> 00:39:41,252
- My apologies.
- What are you doing?

622
00:39:41,325 --> 00:39:43,555
Put me out, put me out!

623
00:39:43,627 --> 00:39:46,061
- Rizzo!
- What?

624
00:39:46,129 --> 00:39:48,029
[Screams]

625
00:39:48,098 --> 00:39:49,429
[Gurgling]

626
00:39:49,499 --> 00:39:52,696
[Shivers]
Oh, oh, Th-th-th-thank you.

627
00:39:52,769 --> 00:39:54,498
You're welcome.

628
00:39:56,874 --> 00:39:59,604
There he is, old Fozziwig himself.

629
00:39:59,676 --> 00:40:03,339
Look my lads, dusk has fallen,
and the lamplighters are at work.

630
00:40:03,413 --> 00:40:05,643
It's Christmas Eve for certain.

631
00:40:05,716 --> 00:40:07,684
What an employer he was.

632
00:40:07,751 --> 00:40:11,118
As hard and as ruthless
as a rose petal.

633
00:40:11,188 --> 00:40:13,452
It's time for the party to begin.

634
00:40:13,523 --> 00:40:16,151
It's the Fozziwig Christmas party.

635
00:40:16,226 --> 00:40:17,921
Rizzo, come on.

636
00:40:18,896 --> 00:40:21,160
Rizzo, just grab hold of the stick.

637
00:40:21,231 --> 00:40:23,495
Merry Christmas.

638
00:40:23,567 --> 00:40:25,558
Thank you, thank you.

639
00:40:27,037 --> 00:40:29,835
Excuse me, everyone.
Can we have some quiet, please?

640
00:40:29,907 --> 00:40:31,932
[Clucking]

641
00:40:32,776 --> 00:40:34,038
Whoa!

642
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,946
I suppose I should be grateful for that.

643
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,885
You're welcome.

644
00:40:44,955 --> 00:40:48,152
Everyone, please,
can I have your attention for a moment?

645
00:40:48,225 --> 00:40:49,214
[They laugh]

646
00:40:49,293 --> 00:40:52,524
Look, it's the Marley brothers.

647
00:40:52,596 --> 00:40:54,723
My old partners, as they were as lads.

648
00:40:54,798 --> 00:40:57,164
Can I have your attention, please?

649
00:40:57,234 --> 00:40:58,758
[Chatter continues]

650
00:41:00,871 --> 00:41:02,736
Quiet!

651
00:41:04,808 --> 00:41:06,173
Thank you.

652
00:41:06,243 --> 00:41:07,870
That's better.

653
00:41:07,945 --> 00:41:11,244
Welcome to Fozziwig and Mom's
annual Christmas party.

654
00:41:11,315 --> 00:41:13,180
At this time in the proceedings,

655
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:16,083
it is a tradition
for me to make a little speech.

656
00:41:16,153 --> 00:41:18,883
And it's a tradition for us
to take a little nap.

657
00:41:18,956 --> 00:41:21,220
[They laugh]

658
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:23,418
Uh, pay no attention to them.

659
00:41:23,493 --> 00:41:26,519
My speech,
here is my Christmas speech.

660
00:41:26,596 --> 00:41:30,157
"Thank you all
and merry Christmas."

661
00:41:30,233 --> 00:41:32,326
- That was the speech?
- That was dumb.

662
00:41:32,402 --> 00:41:34,131
- It was obvious.
- It was pointless.

663
00:41:34,204 --> 00:41:36,365
It was short.

664
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,965
[Both] I loved it! [both laugh]

665
00:41:39,042 --> 00:41:43,308
I'm bored with speeches.
Let's dance, Son!

666
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,848
Here's Mrs. Fozziwig to start the party.

667
00:41:45,916 --> 00:41:48,441
- Way to go, Ma!
- Hit it, boys!

668
00:41:48,518 --> 00:41:50,179
[Grunts]

669
00:41:52,422 --> 00:41:53,548
Hello.

670
00:41:55,158 --> 00:41:57,922
Look, there's a buffet over here.
I'm kind of hungry.

671
00:41:57,995 --> 00:42:01,487
[Sings nonsensically to <i>Deck The Halls]</i>

672
00:42:01,565 --> 00:42:06,127
<i>Fa-la la-la la</i>
<i>La-la la la</i>

673
00:42:06,203 --> 00:42:10,139
Forget it. Mother always taught me,
never eat singing food.

674
00:42:12,509 --> 00:42:14,943
[Fozziwig] A pleasure having you here.

675
00:42:15,012 --> 00:42:17,606
I'm very pleased,
and please enjoy yourself.

676
00:42:17,681 --> 00:42:20,206
Excuse me, Mr. Fozziwig?

677
00:42:20,283 --> 00:42:22,342
Sir, I've been going over the accounts.

678
00:42:22,419 --> 00:42:25,445
Do you know how much the firm
is spending for this party?

679
00:42:25,522 --> 00:42:28,821
Master Scrooge, this is Christmas.

680
00:42:28,892 --> 00:42:30,985
It's a time for generosity.

681
00:42:31,061 --> 00:42:36,556
Stop working, enjoy yourself.
Go meet some people, go ahead.

682
00:42:36,633 --> 00:42:37,759
Hello.

683
00:42:39,903 --> 00:42:42,394
[Pounding]

684
00:42:42,472 --> 00:42:44,463
[Growling, rapid pounding]

685
00:42:46,877 --> 00:42:48,674
[Band strikes up]

686
00:42:51,882 --> 00:42:53,816
You dancing fool!

687
00:43:01,091 --> 00:43:03,491
I love these annual Christmas parties.

688
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,994
I love them so much,
I think we'll do it twice a year.

689
00:43:06,063 --> 00:43:07,360
Excuse me.

690
00:43:07,431 --> 00:43:10,229
- [Fozziwig] Master Scrooge.
- Excuse me.

691
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,360
Belle, I'd like to introduce you
to Ebenezer Scrooge,

692
00:43:13,437 --> 00:43:15,837
the finest young financial mind
in the city.

693
00:43:15,906 --> 00:43:18,306
Ebenezer, this is Belle,

694
00:43:18,375 --> 00:43:20,366
a friend of the Fozziwig family.

695
00:43:20,444 --> 00:43:22,435
I'm pleased to meet you.

696
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:27,211
Well, I'm glad you two finally met.

697
00:43:27,284 --> 00:43:29,650
[Spirit] Do you remember this meeting?

698
00:43:30,987 --> 00:43:32,716
Remember?

699
00:43:34,825 --> 00:43:35,814
Yes.

700
00:43:36,626 --> 00:43:38,651
I remember.

701
00:43:38,728 --> 00:43:42,789
There was, of course, another
Christmas Eve with this young woman,

702
00:43:42,866 --> 00:43:45,198
some years later.

703
00:43:45,268 --> 00:43:49,466
Oh, please,
do not show me that Christmas.

704
00:44:03,587 --> 00:44:05,578
[Birdsong]

705
00:44:10,427 --> 00:44:13,089
Another year
before our wedding, Ebenezer.

706
00:44:13,163 --> 00:44:15,222
It can't be helped, Belle.

707
00:44:16,399 --> 00:44:20,529
How could we marry now? There's
not even enough for a decent home.

708
00:44:20,604 --> 00:44:22,868
The investments haven't grown
as they should.

709
00:44:22,939 --> 00:44:24,930
So you said last year.

710
00:44:25,509 --> 00:44:27,704
Business continues to be poor.

711
00:44:29,412 --> 00:44:32,074
You're a partner in your own firm now.

712
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:35,547
Barely clearing expenses.

713
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:39,020
- You said the partnership was the goal.
- This is for you.

714
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:42,881
I love you, Belle.

715
00:44:44,528 --> 00:44:46,826
You did, once.

716
00:44:52,636 --> 00:44:54,126
[Sobs]

717
00:44:54,971 --> 00:44:56,700
Oh, Rizzo.

718
00:45:01,344 --> 00:45:03,312
Spirit, show me no more.

719
00:45:04,281 --> 00:45:06,647
Why do you delight in torturing me?

720
00:45:06,716 --> 00:45:11,244
I told you, these are the shadows
of the things that have been.

721
00:45:11,321 --> 00:45:15,018
That they are what they are,
do not blame me.

722
00:45:15,091 --> 00:45:17,082
Leave me.

723
00:45:38,381 --> 00:45:42,647
Scrooge was left alone and exhausted
in his bedchamber.

724
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:47,679
And thus he remained, until the
nearby clock began to strike the hour.

725
00:45:48,358 --> 00:45:49,791
[Grunts] Oh.

726
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:52,885
- Oh. Oh, what was that?
- Two o'clock.

727
00:45:52,963 --> 00:45:55,397
- Is it too early for breakfast?
- Yes.

728
00:45:55,465 --> 00:45:57,899
Oh, good, supper time.

729
00:45:57,968 --> 00:45:59,458
[Ding]

730
00:46:01,371 --> 00:46:02,838
[Ding]

731
00:46:02,906 --> 00:46:06,865
[Dickens] Scrooge knew
the second of the ghosts was due.

732
00:46:06,943 --> 00:46:10,174
Yet now,
as the clock finished striking...

733
00:46:11,748 --> 00:46:13,272
Nothing.

734
00:46:14,884 --> 00:46:16,112
[Laughing]

735
00:46:16,186 --> 00:46:19,121
Come in, and know me better, man.

736
00:46:33,737 --> 00:46:36,467
Come in, and know me better, man.

737
00:46:36,539 --> 00:46:39,337
- Did I already say that?
- You did.

738
00:46:39,409 --> 00:46:42,207
I am the Ghost of Christmas Present.

739
00:46:42,279 --> 00:46:46,682
This is the night before the dawn
before the day of Christmas.

740
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:50,686
Did I tell you that I am
the Ghost of Christmas Present?

741
00:46:50,754 --> 00:46:55,521
- You did.
- Come in, know me better, man.

742
00:46:55,592 --> 00:46:57,753
You're a little absent-minded, spirit.

743
00:46:57,827 --> 00:47:02,264
No, I'm a large
absent-minded spirit. [chuckles]

744
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,535
My mind is filled
with the here and now.

745
00:47:06,603 --> 00:47:10,437
And the now is Christmas. [laughs]

746
00:47:10,507 --> 00:47:14,238
[Scrooge laughs] I don't believe I've
ever met anybody like you before, sir.

747
00:47:14,311 --> 00:47:18,645
Really? Over 1,800 of my brothers
have come before me.

748
00:47:18,715 --> 00:47:22,048
1,800? Lmagine the grocery bills.

749
00:47:22,118 --> 00:47:24,109
[Both laugh]

750
00:47:27,524 --> 00:47:31,824
Have you ever noticed that everything
seems wonderful at Christmas?

751
00:47:33,396 --> 00:47:38,197
Uh, in all honesty, spirit, no.

752
00:47:39,669 --> 00:47:42,604
Perhaps I've never understood
about Christmas.

753
00:47:42,672 --> 00:47:46,699
Before this day is done,
you will understand.

754
00:47:46,776 --> 00:47:48,744
Oh. [laughs]

755
00:47:48,812 --> 00:47:50,643
Oh, no! Oh, no!

756
00:47:53,016 --> 00:47:56,281
We shall go out into the world.

757
00:47:59,155 --> 00:48:01,555
I suppose you enjoyed that?

758
00:48:01,624 --> 00:48:03,148
Of course.

759
00:48:08,231 --> 00:48:12,793
May I welcome you
to Christmas morning?

760
00:48:12,869 --> 00:48:14,598
[Laughs]

761
00:48:15,271 --> 00:48:16,829
[They sing]

762
00:48:22,379 --> 00:48:25,314
<i>It's in the singing</i>

763
00:48:25,382 --> 00:48:27,976
<i>It's going home</i>

766
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:36,486
<i>A cup of kindness</i>

767
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:39,289
<i>A sweet reunion</i>

00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:18,997
<i>A pair of mittens</i>

<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

797
00:50:35,144 --> 00:50:39,547
It feels like Christmas!

798
00:50:41,217 --> 00:50:47,986
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

799
00:50:51,094 --> 00:50:52,789
Spirit, I had no idea.

800
00:50:52,862 --> 00:50:56,889
I wish to see friends, kin.
Show me family.

801
00:50:59,068 --> 00:51:03,027
It's Fred. My dear nephew Fred
and his wife, Clara.

802
00:51:03,106 --> 00:51:05,040
Having Christmas with friends.

803
00:51:06,075 --> 00:51:07,565
Hey, look. Fruit.

804
00:51:07,644 --> 00:51:10,738
Well, now, we've had the plum pudding
and sung the carols.

805
00:51:10,813 --> 00:51:12,804
- What now, my lovelies?
- A game, Fred.

806
00:51:12,882 --> 00:51:15,043
Yeah, we must have a game at Christmas.

807
00:51:15,118 --> 00:51:18,610
- Do people play games at Christmas?
- I love games.

808
00:51:18,688 --> 00:51:21,350
Say, do you know that fruit is wax?

809
00:51:21,424 --> 00:51:24,860
Oh, yeah,
I wondered about the texture. Yeuch!

810
00:51:24,928 --> 00:51:28,056
- Let's play "Yes and No."
- Oh, wonderful game.

811
00:51:28,131 --> 00:51:31,191
Yah! That's a great game. I'll be it.

812
00:51:31,267 --> 00:51:34,031
Yes, let Fred be it.
He always thinks of good things.

813
00:51:34,103 --> 00:51:36,503
I do have a good one, Clara. Guess.

814
00:51:36,573 --> 00:51:38,564
Is it vegetable?

815
00:51:38,641 --> 00:51:40,165
- [Fred] No.
- [Clara] Mineral?

816
00:51:40,243 --> 00:51:41,642
- No.
- Animal, then?

817
00:51:41,711 --> 00:51:43,611
- What else?
- What else, indeed.

818
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,910
- Is it found on a farm?
- Never.

819
00:51:45,982 --> 00:51:47,677
- In the city?
- Usually.

820
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,980
Does it pull a hansom cab?

821
00:51:50,053 --> 00:51:51,577
Certainly not.

822
00:51:51,654 --> 00:51:53,383
How about a dog?

823
00:51:53,456 --> 00:51:54,445
No.

824
00:51:54,524 --> 00:51:55,650
- A cat?
- A cat?

825
00:51:55,725 --> 00:51:59,058
- I said it first.
- No.

826
00:51:59,128 --> 00:52:01,688
Wait, is this an unwanted creature?

827
00:52:01,764 --> 00:52:03,959
- Often.
- A mouse?

828
00:52:04,033 --> 00:52:05,261
- No.
- A rat?

829
00:52:05,335 --> 00:52:07,428
- You called?
- A cockroach.

830
00:52:07,503 --> 00:52:08,492
No.

831
00:52:08,571 --> 00:52:10,095
- A leech?
- It's too wonderful.

832
00:52:10,173 --> 00:52:13,165
Wait, I know.
An unwanted creature,

833
00:52:13,242 --> 00:52:15,710
but not a rat, a leech,
or a cockroach?

834
00:52:15,778 --> 00:52:16,836
Then what?

835
00:52:16,913 --> 00:52:19,245
- What?
- It's Ebenezer Scrooge.

836
00:52:19,315 --> 00:52:20,304
Yes.

837
00:52:20,383 --> 00:52:22,647
- [All laugh]
- Wonderful.

838
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,416
[Female friend] That's a killer.

839
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:36,632
Come, there is much to see.

840
00:52:36,699 --> 00:52:39,668
No more. I wish to see no more.

841
00:52:44,507 --> 00:52:46,475
Here.

842
00:52:46,542 --> 00:52:48,840
Why have we come
to this odd corner of the town?

843
00:52:48,911 --> 00:52:51,573
It's Christmas here, too, you know.

844
00:52:51,648 --> 00:52:54,344
That's Bob Cratchit's house.

845
00:52:54,417 --> 00:52:57,147
Perhaps it was the spirit's
own generous nature,

846
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:59,347
and his sympathy for all poor men,

847
00:52:59,422 --> 00:53:03,688
that led them straight to the home
of Scrooge's faithful clerk.

848
00:53:05,628 --> 00:53:08,324
Goose. They're cooking goose down there.

849
00:53:08,398 --> 00:53:09,831
[Sniffs]

850
00:53:09,899 --> 00:53:12,527
Rizzo, get out of the way.

851
00:53:12,602 --> 00:53:14,797
Hey, don't be sweeping
the chimney now.

852
00:53:14,871 --> 00:53:16,896
You're blocking the smell. [sniffs]

853
00:53:18,107 --> 00:53:21,508
- This is Bob Cratchit's house?
- How do you know that?

854
00:53:21,577 --> 00:53:23,670
You just told me.

855
00:53:23,746 --> 00:53:26,715
Hmm. Well, I'm usually trustworthy.

856
00:53:26,783 --> 00:53:28,273
[Chuckles]

857
00:53:28,351 --> 00:53:30,911
[Woman sings inside]

858
00:53:30,987 --> 00:53:33,956
- Who's that?
- Mrs. Cratchit, of course.

859
00:53:34,157 --> 00:53:36,057
[Sings to herself]

860
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,718
[Sniffs] Ahh!

861
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:44,290
Peter, do not stop turning that spit.

862
00:53:44,367 --> 00:53:47,564
That is the whole secret
of a properly roasted goose.

863
00:53:47,637 --> 00:53:52,040
- It smells so good, Mother.
- It does, doesn't it?

864
00:53:52,108 --> 00:53:55,373
[Sniffs] Oh. That smells wonderful.

865
00:53:56,479 --> 00:53:57,912
Oh, good grief.

866
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:00,107
Hey, I'm stuck, get me out of here.

867
00:54:00,183 --> 00:54:02,310
I knew you weren't suited
for literature.

868
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:05,009
[Rizzo screams]

869
00:54:06,589 --> 00:54:09,023
Oh, at least I landed
on something soft.

870
00:54:09,092 --> 00:54:11,151
And hot! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

871
00:54:11,227 --> 00:54:13,525
Hot, hot, hot!

872
00:54:14,363 --> 00:54:16,524
Mother, Mother, Mother!

873
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:21,696
You said we couldn't eat the chestnuts
until Father and Tiny Tim get home.

874
00:54:21,771 --> 00:54:23,864
I wasn't eating them,

875
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:27,535
I was merely checking them
to see if they were not burnt.

876
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:30,579
It's a chef's thing, dear.
And do not shout, Betina.

877
00:54:30,646 --> 00:54:33,672
- I'm Belinda.
- I'm Betina.

878
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:36,116
Of course you are, Betina.

879
00:54:36,185 --> 00:54:37,709
Belinda.

880
00:54:38,855 --> 00:54:40,584
Whatever.

881
00:54:41,891 --> 00:54:44,325
- [Faint singing]
- Huh?

882
00:54:44,393 --> 00:54:46,224
[Bebop-style singing]

883
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:49,820
[Cratchit scats]

884
00:54:49,899 --> 00:54:54,359
<i>'Tis the season</i>
<i>to be jolly and joyous, fa la la</i>

885
00:54:54,437 --> 00:54:59,534
<i>With a burst of pleasure</i>
<i>we feel it arrive, fa la la</i>

886
00:54:59,609 --> 00:55:04,410
<i>It's a season when the saints</i>
<i>can employ us, fa la la</i>

887
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,109
<i>To spread the news about</i>
<i>peace and to keep love alive</i>

888
00:55:12,555 --> 00:55:13,852
Come on, son.

889
00:55:13,923 --> 00:55:16,357
Let's go see if Christmas dinner
is ready yet.

890
00:55:16,425 --> 00:55:18,518
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes.

891
00:55:22,565 --> 00:55:24,863
Merry Christmas, everyone.

892
00:55:24,934 --> 00:55:26,060
Daddy!

893
00:55:29,338 --> 00:55:30,669
Merry Christmas, girls.

894
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:32,935
- Merry Christmas, Peter.
- Merry Christmas.

895
00:55:33,009 --> 00:55:35,671
Children, children,
it's time to set the table.

896
00:55:35,745 --> 00:55:38,578
- Go ahead.
- Wait for me.

897
00:55:38,648 --> 00:55:42,084
- Merry Christmas, Emily.
- Merry Christmas...

898
00:55:42,151 --> 00:55:43,482
Crachy.

899
00:55:44,253 --> 00:55:45,242
Emmy.

900
00:55:49,625 --> 00:55:53,925
I fell down the chimney
and landed on a flaming hot goose.

901
00:55:53,996 --> 00:55:56,829
You have all the fun.

902
00:55:56,899 --> 00:55:58,924
What?

903
00:55:59,001 --> 00:56:01,629
Peter, the Christmas dinner.

904
00:56:01,704 --> 00:56:03,638
The goose, the goose.

905
00:56:03,706 --> 00:56:05,571
[Laughs, coughs]

906
00:56:07,109 --> 00:56:10,977
Oh, no, now, son,
you've gotten too excited.

907
00:56:11,047 --> 00:56:15,279
You go sit in your chair a moment.
Rest a moment.

908
00:56:15,351 --> 00:56:19,185
- How was he at church?
- As good as gold and better.

909
00:56:19,255 --> 00:56:21,416
He said he hoped the people
saw him in church

910
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:25,017
because it might be pleasant for them
to remember upon Christmas Day

911
00:56:25,094 --> 00:56:29,190
who made lame beggars walk
and blind men see.

912
00:56:29,265 --> 00:56:31,256
A remarkable child.

913
00:56:32,735 --> 00:56:35,636
[Dickens] With that,
the Cratchits came to what was surely

914
00:56:35,705 --> 00:56:39,801
the happiest single moment
in all the livelong year.

915
00:56:39,876 --> 00:56:43,676
- Such a meager feast.
- But very much appreciated.

916
00:56:45,548 --> 00:56:47,812
I pay Bob such a small amount.

917
00:56:47,884 --> 00:56:50,375
- Mr. Scrooge.
- Bob.

918
00:56:50,453 --> 00:56:52,546
Bob Cratchit?

919
00:56:52,622 --> 00:56:55,591
It only seems right that
I should lift a glass to my employer.

920
00:56:55,658 --> 00:56:58,456
I give you Mr. Scrooge,
the founder of the feast.

921
00:56:58,527 --> 00:57:01,792
The founder of the feast, indeed. Huh!

922
00:57:01,864 --> 00:57:05,732
If I had him here, I would give him
a piece of my mind to feast upon.

923
00:57:05,801 --> 00:57:07,735
And I bet he would choke on it.

924
00:57:07,803 --> 00:57:10,271
- Choke!
- My dear, the children.

925
00:57:10,339 --> 00:57:11,567
Christmas Day.

926
00:57:11,641 --> 00:57:16,101
Well, I suppose that
on the blessed day of Christmas,

927
00:57:16,178 --> 00:57:19,807
one must drink to the health
of Mr. Scrooge,

928
00:57:19,882 --> 00:57:23,147
even though he is odious,
stingy, wicked,

929
00:57:23,219 --> 00:57:27,019
and unfeeling, and badly dressed...

930
00:57:27,089 --> 00:57:30,547
To the founder of the feast,
Mr. Scrooge.

931
00:57:30,626 --> 00:57:36,895
To Mr. Scrooge, he'll be very merry
and happy this day, I have no doubt.

932
00:57:36,966 --> 00:57:37,955
No doubt.

933
00:57:38,034 --> 00:57:39,331
Mm. Cheers.

934
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:44,738
God bless us, every one.

935
00:57:46,943 --> 00:57:49,912
<i>Life is full of sweet surprises</i>

936
00:57:49,979 --> 00:57:52,277
<i>Every day's a gift</i>

<i>Fills me up with laughter</i>
<i>Fills me up with song</i>

00:58:03,392 --> 00:58:06,259
<i>I look into the eyes of love</i>

941
00:58:06,329 --> 00:58:09,560
<i>And know that I belong</i>

942

<i>Bless us all</i>

943
00:58:12,368 --> 00:58:15,132
<i>Who gather here</i>

944
00:58:15,204 --> 00:58:20,699
<i>The loving family I hold dear</i>

945
00:58:20,776 --> 00:58:23,472
<i>No place on Earth</i>

946
00:58:23,546 --> 00:58:26,310
<i>Compares with home</i>

00:58:26,382 --> 00:58:31,684
<i>And every path will bring me</i>
<i>back from where I roam</i>

948

949
00:58:34,757 --> 00:58:37,282
<i>That as we live</i>

00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:43,196
<i>We always comfort and forgive</i>

951
00:58:43,265 --> 00:58:45,529
<i>We have so much</i>

952
00:58:45,601 --> 00:58:48,502
<i>That we can share</i>

953
00:58:48,571 --> 00:58:53,804
<i>With those in need</i>
<i>we see around us everywhere</i>

954
00:58:53,876 --> 00:58:58,210
<i>Let us always love each other</i>

955
00:58:59,515 --> 00:59:02,780
<i>Lead us to the light</i>

956
00:59:05,354 --> 00:59:10,690
<i>Let us hear the voice of reason</i>

957
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:13,786
<i>Singing in the night</i>

958
00:59:16,198 --> 00:59:19,634
<i>Let us run from anger</i>

959
00:59:21,604 --> 00:59:25,631
<i>And catch us when we fall</i>

960
00:59:27,476 --> 00:59:32,641
<i>Teach us in our dreams</i>
<i>And please, yes, please,</i>

961
00:59:32,715 --> 00:59:36,048
<i>Bless us, one and all</i>

962
00:59:39,488 --> 00:59:41,683
<i>Bless us all</i>

963
00:59:41,757 --> 00:59:44,225
<i>With playful years</i>

00:59:44,293 --> 00:59:49,822
<i>With noisy games and joyful tears</i>

965
00:59:49,899 --> 00:59:52,800
<i>We reach for you</i>

966
00:59:52,868 --> 00:59:55,837
<i>And we stand tall</i>

967
00:59:55,905 --> 01:00:01,468
<i>And in our prayers and dreams</i>
<i>We ask you, bless us all</i>

968
01:00:01,544 --> 01:00:04,206
<i>We reach for you</i>

969
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:08,080

<i>And in our prayers and dreams,</i>

971
01:00:12,655 --> 01:00:16,682
<i>Bless us all</i>

972
01:00:16,759 --> 01:00:18,624
[coughs]

973
01:00:22,965 --> 01:00:26,423
[Emmy] Let's all take our seats now.
Let's have dinner.

974
01:00:26,502 --> 01:00:30,666
Spirit, tell me if Tiny Tim will live.

975
01:00:30,739 --> 01:00:32,798
That is the future.

976
01:00:32,875 --> 01:00:34,866
My realm is the present.

977
01:00:34,944 --> 01:00:40,314
However, I see a vacant seat
by the chimney corner.

978
01:00:40,382 --> 01:00:42,714
And a crutch without an owner.

979
01:00:42,785 --> 01:00:48,280
If these shadows remain unaltered,
I believe the child will die.

980
01:00:48,357 --> 01:00:51,815
But then, if he's going to die,
he'd better do it,

981
01:00:51,894 --> 01:00:55,159
and decrease the surplus population.

982
01:00:55,231 --> 01:00:56,630
Oh, spirit.

983
01:00:56,699 --> 01:00:59,827
[Dickens] As the Cratchit family
vanished into the darkness,

984
01:00:59,902 --> 01:01:04,168
Scrooge kept his eyes upon Tiny Tim,
until the last.

985
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:07,801
Come. My time grows short.

986
01:01:07,877 --> 01:01:09,868
[Wind whistles]

987
01:01:14,683 --> 01:01:16,617
Spirit, do you grow old?

988
01:01:16,685 --> 01:01:19,245
I do. [chuckles]

989
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:23,754
Are spirits' lives so short?

990
01:01:23,826 --> 01:01:26,818
My time upon this globe is very brief.

991
01:01:26,896 --> 01:01:33,131
I believe it will end
upon the stroke of 12.

992
01:01:33,202 --> 01:01:35,067
- [Ding]
- [Rizzo] One.

993
01:01:35,137 --> 01:01:39,904
Now? But spirit,
I have learned so much from you.

994
01:01:40,009 --> 01:01:42,807
Nothing Scrooge could do or say
could stop

995
01:01:42,878 --> 01:01:46,075
the relentless march
of those terrible bells.

996
01:01:46,148 --> 01:01:48,139
[Rizzo] Five!

997
01:01:48,217 --> 01:01:50,549
Oh, spirit, do not leave me.

998
01:01:50,619 --> 01:01:53,417
I think I must, in fact.

999
01:01:53,522 --> 01:01:56,582
You have meant so much to me.
You have changed me.

1000
01:01:56,692 --> 01:02:02,028
And now I leave you with
the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come.

1001
01:02:02,097 --> 01:02:05,498
- You mean, the future?
- Mm.

1002
01:02:05,568 --> 01:02:06,626
Must I?

1003
01:02:06,702 --> 01:02:12,470
Go forth, and know him better, man.
[Laughs]

1004
01:02:54,917 --> 01:02:58,944
Am I in the presence of the
Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come?

1005
01:03:02,791 --> 01:03:09,219
Spirit, I fear you more
than any specter I have yet met.

1006
01:03:10,633 --> 01:03:13,796
This is too scary.
I don't think I want to see any more.

1007
01:03:13,869 --> 01:03:17,134
When you're right, you're right.
You're on your own, folks.

1008
01:03:17,206 --> 01:03:21,040
- We'll meet you at the finale.
- Yeah.

1009
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:26,643
I am prepared to follow and to learn,
with a thankful heart.

1010
01:03:29,985 --> 01:03:32,453
Will you not speak to me?

1011
01:03:36,759 --> 01:03:40,820
Oh, yes, the night is waning fast.

1012
01:03:40,896 --> 01:03:42,887
Lead on, spirit.

1013
01:04:06,221 --> 01:04:08,951
No, I don't know much about it,
either way.

1014
01:04:09,024 --> 01:04:11,720
I only know he's dead.

1015
01:04:11,794 --> 01:04:14,957
- When?
- Last night, I believe.

1016
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:18,329
Wonder what he died of.
I thought he'd never go.

1017
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,765
[All laugh]

1018
01:04:19,835 --> 01:04:22,030
I don't know or care why he's gone.

1019
01:04:22,104 --> 01:04:24,538
I'd just like to know
what he's done with his money.

1020
01:04:24,606 --> 01:04:26,130
Wouldn't we all?

1021
01:04:26,208 --> 01:04:27,971
He didn't give it to me.

1022
01:04:29,345 --> 01:04:31,939
It's likely to be a cheap funeral.

1023
01:04:32,014 --> 01:04:34,847
I don't know a single soul
who would go to it.

1024
01:04:34,917 --> 01:04:37,249
- I wouldn't mind going.
- Eh?

1025
01:04:37,319 --> 01:04:39,549
If lunch is provided.

1026
01:04:39,621 --> 01:04:41,748
[All snort and laugh]

1027
01:04:41,824 --> 01:04:44,156
- Speaking of lunch...
- Oh, yes.

1028
01:04:47,496 --> 01:04:50,294
I know some of those gentlemen, spirit.

1029
01:04:50,366 --> 01:04:53,392
Of what poor wretch do they speak?

1030
01:05:08,851 --> 01:05:12,878
So, back from the house of sadness,
I see.

1031
01:05:12,955 --> 01:05:16,482
Sad that he didn't die years ago,
the old skinflint.

1032
01:05:16,558 --> 01:05:18,685
- Hear, hear.
- Let me see.

1033
01:05:18,761 --> 01:05:21,059
What have you got for old Joe?

1034
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:24,930
What have you got for me
to remember him by?

1035
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,797
Joe, get off.

1036
01:05:26,869 --> 01:05:30,862
Well, I got these collar buttons
from his dresser.

1037
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:34,170
Mother of pearl.

1038
01:05:34,243 --> 01:05:37,007
No, I got his bed curtains.

1039
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:40,139
Very fine damask. [laughs]

1040
01:05:40,215 --> 01:05:44,015
Very cheap damask.
But worth a few coins.

1041
01:05:44,086 --> 01:05:46,316
I've got his blankets.

1042
01:05:46,388 --> 01:05:51,917
His blankets?
Why, Mrs. Dilber, they're still warm.

1043
01:05:51,994 --> 01:05:55,589
I don't pay extra for the warmth,
you know.

1044
01:05:55,664 --> 01:05:58,690
You should.
It's the only warmth he ever had.

1045
01:05:58,767 --> 01:06:00,359
[All laugh]

1046
01:06:06,074 --> 01:06:07,701
I understand, spirit.

1047
01:06:07,776 --> 01:06:11,143
The case of this unhappy man
might be my own.

1048
01:06:11,213 --> 01:06:13,875
My life turns that way now.

1049
01:06:13,949 --> 01:06:15,940
Merciful heavens.

1050
01:06:16,919 --> 01:06:20,446
Let me see some tenderness
connected with this world,

1051
01:06:20,522 --> 01:06:23,889
or I'll be haunted
by that terrible conversation forever.

1052
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:34,333
It's Bob Cratchit's house.

1053
01:06:34,403 --> 01:06:36,837
Oh, yes, spirit.

1054
01:06:36,905 --> 01:06:38,896
A place of joy and laughter.

1055
01:06:39,842 --> 01:06:42,367
Thank you for bringing me here.

1056
01:06:47,916 --> 01:06:50,214
It's so quiet.

1057
01:06:52,588 --> 01:06:54,954
Why is it so quiet, spirit?

1058
01:07:07,302 --> 01:07:09,202
[Sniffing]

1059
01:07:12,007 --> 01:07:13,838
Mother, you're crying again.

1060
01:07:13,909 --> 01:07:17,345
It's just the lamplight,
that hurts my eyes.

1061
01:07:21,884 --> 01:07:23,875
Not Tiny Tim?

1062
01:07:25,354 --> 01:07:29,757
There, now.
My eyes get weak in the dim light.

1063
01:07:29,825 --> 01:07:33,192
I would not want to show
weak eyes to your father,

1064
01:07:33,262 --> 01:07:35,526
when he gets home,
for anything in the world.

1065
01:07:35,597 --> 01:07:38,430
He should be back now.

1066
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:43,335
I think he's walked a little slower
these past two evenings.

1067
01:07:44,406 --> 01:07:46,533
Hello, my dears.

1068
01:07:46,608 --> 01:07:47,734
Daddy.

1069
01:07:50,178 --> 01:07:51,941
Hello, girls.

1070
01:07:52,014 --> 01:07:53,072
Hello, Peter.

1071
01:07:53,148 --> 01:07:56,481
Children, please go set the table.

1072
01:07:56,552 --> 01:07:58,417
Thank you.

1073
01:07:58,487 --> 01:08:00,079
How was the churchyard?

1074
01:08:00,155 --> 01:08:01,747
It will be lovely, Emily.

1075
01:08:01,823 --> 01:08:05,919
It would have done you good
to see how green the place is.

1076
01:08:05,994 --> 01:08:10,829
I picked a spot for Tim
where he can see...

1077
01:08:10,899 --> 01:08:13,732
It's, it's a spot on the hill.

1078
01:08:13,802 --> 01:08:16,270
You can see the ducks on the river.

1079
01:08:16,338 --> 01:08:17,566
Tiny Tim...

1080
01:08:17,639 --> 01:08:21,439
Tiny Tim always loved
watching the ducks on the river.

1081
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:30,016
Spirit, must there be a Christmas
that brings this awful scene?

1082
01:08:31,987 --> 01:08:33,978
How can we endure it?

1083
01:08:36,825 --> 01:08:39,089
It's all right, children.

1084
01:08:40,295 --> 01:08:42,661
Life is made up
of meetings and partings.

1085
01:08:42,731 --> 01:08:44,562
That is the way of it.

1086
01:08:45,734 --> 01:08:48,862
I am sure we shall never forget
Tiny Tim.

1087
01:08:48,937 --> 01:08:51,735
Or this first parting
that there was among us.

1088
01:08:57,579 --> 01:08:59,740
[Quiet sniffing]

1089
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:30,471
Must we return to this place?

1090
01:09:34,016 --> 01:09:36,177
There is something else
that I must know?

1091
01:09:36,251 --> 01:09:38,776
Is that not true?

1092
01:09:40,355 --> 01:09:43,722
Spirit, I know what I must ask.

1093
01:09:43,792 --> 01:09:46,226
I fear to, but I must.

1094
01:09:47,529 --> 01:09:49,190
Who was the wretched man

1095
01:09:49,264 --> 01:09:52,131
whose death brought
so much glee and happiness to others?

1096
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:07,114
Answer me one more question.

1097
01:10:07,182 --> 01:10:09,650
Are these the shadows
of things that will be?

1098
01:10:09,718 --> 01:10:12,380
Or are they the shadows
of things that may be, only?

1099
01:10:21,863 --> 01:10:24,195
These events can be changed.

1100
01:10:36,545 --> 01:10:38,877
A life can be made right.

1101
01:10:59,768 --> 01:11:01,895
Ebenezer Scrooge.

1102
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:04,803
Oh, please, spirit, no.

1103
01:11:04,873 --> 01:11:07,398
Hear me, I'm not the man I was.

1104
01:11:09,177 --> 01:11:12,510
Why would you show me this
if I was past all hope?

1105
01:11:14,182 --> 01:11:18,118
I will honor Christmas,
and try to keep it all the year.

1106
01:11:20,689 --> 01:11:25,092
I will live my life in the past,
the present, and the future.

1107
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:28,926
I will not shut out the lessons
the spirits have taught me.

1108
01:11:28,997 --> 01:11:32,330
Tell me that I may sponge out
the writing on this stone.

1109
01:11:35,036 --> 01:11:37,766
Spirit, please speak to me.

1110
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:43,541
[Clock ticks]

1111
01:11:56,825 --> 01:11:58,486
I'm home.

1112
01:12:02,063 --> 01:12:04,088
[Dickens]
Yes, the bedposts were his own.

1113
01:12:04,166 --> 01:12:07,465
The bed was his own.
The room was his own.

1114
01:12:07,536 --> 01:12:09,766
Hi, guys, we're back.

1115
01:12:09,838 --> 01:12:11,806
We promised we would be.

1116
01:12:11,873 --> 01:12:14,364
But the thing that made Scrooge
happiest of all

1117
01:12:14,442 --> 01:12:16,433
was that his life lay before him.

1118
01:12:16,511 --> 01:12:18,604
And it could be changed.

1119
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:22,116
I will live my life in the past,
the present, and the future.

1120
01:12:22,184 --> 01:12:24,709
Oh, Jacob and Robert Marley.

1121
01:12:24,786 --> 01:12:27,380
Heaven in the Christmas time
be praised for this day.

1122
01:12:27,455 --> 01:12:29,616
I say it on my knees,
Jacob and Robert.

1123
01:12:29,691 --> 01:12:30,953
On my knees.

1124
01:12:31,026 --> 01:12:34,553
Oh, they're not torn down.
They're here.

1125
01:12:34,629 --> 01:12:37,257
And I'm here. It's a miracle.

1126
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:44,998
I don't know what to do.
I'm as light as a feather.

1127
01:12:45,073 --> 01:12:48,406
I'm as happy as an angel,
I'm as merry as a schoolboy.

1128
01:12:48,476 --> 01:12:51,206
Do you think it's safe
for us to be up here?

1129
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:53,304
Scrooge is saved,
what can happen now?

1130
01:12:53,381 --> 01:12:54,541
Yeah.

1131
01:12:58,286 --> 01:13:00,186
You there, boy.

1132
01:13:00,255 --> 01:13:01,779
What, me?

1133
01:13:02,824 --> 01:13:05,156
Uh, that is, "What, me, sir?"

1134
01:13:05,227 --> 01:13:07,559
- What's today?
- Pardon?

1135
01:13:07,629 --> 01:13:09,688
What's today, my fine fellow?

1136
01:13:09,764 --> 01:13:12,460
Today? Today is Christmas Day.

1137
01:13:12,534 --> 01:13:14,058
It's Christmas Day?

1138
01:13:14,135 --> 01:13:17,366
I haven't missed it.
The spirits did it all in one night.

1139
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:20,499
They can do anything they like.
Of course they can.

1140
01:13:20,575 --> 01:13:23,043
- Of course they can.
- Of course they can.

1141
01:13:23,111 --> 01:13:24,942
Know the poultry shop nearby?

1142
01:13:25,013 --> 01:13:27,379
- Yes, sir, I do.
- An intelligent lad.

1143
01:13:27,449 --> 01:13:29,940
A remarkable lad.

1144
01:13:30,018 --> 01:13:33,112
Do you know whether the prize turkey
has been sold in the window?

1145
01:13:33,188 --> 01:13:36,282
The one twice as big as me?
It's still there.

1146
01:13:36,358 --> 01:13:38,417
It's a pleasure talking with you, lad.

1147
01:13:38,493 --> 01:13:40,927
- Go and buy it.
- Be serious.

1148
01:13:40,996 --> 01:13:44,090
I am serious. Buy it for me
and I'll give you a shilling.

1149
01:13:44,165 --> 01:13:46,497
No, I'll give you five shillings.

1150
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:49,698
Wow!

1151
01:13:49,771 --> 01:13:52,569
And so the boy was off like a shot.
So even...

1152
01:13:54,209 --> 01:13:56,006
Um... Sorry.

1153
01:13:57,178 --> 01:13:59,305
I'll bring it to Bob Cratchit's house.

1154
01:13:59,381 --> 01:14:03,249
What a surprise it'll be.
It's twice the size of Tiny Tim.

1155
01:14:03,318 --> 01:14:06,719
And a few moments later,
dressed in his finest,

1156
01:14:06,788 --> 01:14:09,348
Scrooge appeared
on the streets of the city

1157
01:14:09,424 --> 01:14:13,224
to wish Merry Christmas
to all the world.

1158
01:14:13,295 --> 01:14:15,388
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1159
01:14:15,463 --> 01:14:17,397
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1160
01:14:17,465 --> 01:14:19,763
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

1161
01:14:21,636 --> 01:14:23,433
Gee, thanks.

1162
01:14:23,505 --> 01:14:27,100
Everyone was out and about
this fine morning.

1163
01:14:27,175 --> 01:14:30,542
And soon he encountered
two familiar faces.

1164
01:14:30,612 --> 01:14:32,102
- [Yelps]
- [Gasps]

1165
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:33,738
Mr. Scrooge.

1166
01:14:33,815 --> 01:14:36,409
Pardon me, gentlemen,
but about the charity donation

1167
01:14:36,484 --> 01:14:38,281
you asked me for yesterday?

1168
01:14:38,353 --> 01:14:39,911
Put me down for...

1169
01:14:42,257 --> 01:14:43,383
That much?

1170
01:14:43,458 --> 01:14:45,289
Not a penny less.

1171
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:48,352
A great many back payments
are included in it, I assure you.

1172
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:51,263
My goodness,
I don't know what to say.

1173
01:14:51,333 --> 01:14:54,325
I just wish there was something
we could give you.

1174
01:14:59,641 --> 01:15:01,836
A gift?

1175
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:04,003
A gift for me?

1176
01:15:11,619 --> 01:15:13,143
Thank you.

1177
01:15:13,855 --> 01:15:15,049
Thank you.

1178
01:15:15,123 --> 01:15:19,321
- 50 times! And a Merry Christmas.
- Here's your turkey, Mr. Scrooge.

1179
01:15:19,394 --> 01:15:21,385
Follow me, lad.

1180
01:15:23,031 --> 01:15:25,522
<i>With a thankful heart,</i>
<i>with an endless joy</i>

1181
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,068
<i>With a growing family</i>
<i>Every girl and boy</i>

1182
01:15:28,136 --> 01:15:30,604
<i>Will be nephew and niece to me</i>

1183
01:15:30,672 --> 01:15:32,867
<i>Nephew and niece to me</i>

1184
01:15:32,941 --> 01:15:35,808
<i>Will bring love, hope,</i>
<i>and peace to me</i>

1185
01:15:35,877 --> 01:15:38,004
<i>Love, hope, and peace to me</i>

1186
01:15:38,079 --> 01:15:40,274
<i>Yes, and every night will end</i>

1187
01:15:40,348 --> 01:15:42,646
<i>And every day will start</i>

1188
01:15:42,717 --> 01:15:47,654
<i>With a grateful prayer</i>
<i>and a thankful heart</i>

1189
01:15:47,722 --> 01:15:50,213
<i>With an open smile</i>
<i>and with open doors</i>

1190
01:15:50,291 --> 01:15:52,725
<i>I will bid you welcome</i>
<i>What is mine is yours</i>

1191
01:15:52,794 --> 01:15:55,228
<i>With a glass raised</i>
<i>to toast your health</i>

1192
01:15:55,296 --> 01:15:57,821
<i>With a glass raised</i>
<i>to toast your health</i>

1193
01:15:57,899 --> 01:16:00,333
<i>And a promise to share the wealth</i>

1194
01:16:00,402 --> 01:16:02,666
<i>A promise to share the wealth</i>

1195
01:16:02,737 --> 01:16:04,898
<i>I will sail a friendly course</i>

1196
01:16:04,973 --> 01:16:07,271
<i>Follow a friendly chart</i>

1197
01:16:07,342 --> 01:16:11,676
<i>On a sea of love</i>
<i>and a thankful heart</i>

1198
01:16:11,746 --> 01:16:14,146
<i>Life is like a journey</i>

1199
01:16:16,317 --> 01:16:18,683
<i>Who knows when it ends?</i>

1200
01:16:22,090 --> 01:16:24,581
<i>Yes, and if you need to know</i>

1201
01:16:24,659 --> 01:16:27,093
<i>The measure of a man</i>

1202
01:16:27,162 --> 01:16:31,292
<i>You simply count his friends</i>

1203
01:16:31,366 --> 01:16:34,733
<i>Stop and look around you</i>

1204
01:16:35,904 --> 01:16:39,567
<i>The glory that you see</i>

1205
01:16:42,043 --> 01:16:46,776
<i>Is born again each day</i>
<i>Don't let it slip away</i>

1206
01:16:46,848 --> 01:16:50,682
<i>How precious life can be</i>

1207
01:17:36,731 --> 01:17:39,222
<i>With a thankful heart</i>
<i>that is wide awake</i>

1208
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:41,700
<i>I do make this promise,</i>
<i>every breath I take</i>

1209
01:17:41,769 --> 01:17:44,499
<i>Will be used now to sing your praise</i>

1210
01:17:44,572 --> 01:17:46,767
<i>Used now to sing your praise</i>

1211
01:17:46,841 --> 01:17:49,401
<i>And to beg you to share my days</i>

1212
01:17:49,477 --> 01:17:51,775
<i>Beg you to share my days</i>

1213
01:17:51,846 --> 01:17:54,041
<i>With a loving guarantee</i>

1214
01:17:54,115 --> 01:17:56,481
<i>That even if we part</i>

1215
01:17:56,551 --> 01:18:00,078
<i>I will hold you close</i>
<i>in a thankful heart</i>

1216
01:18:01,456 --> 01:18:06,792
<i>I will hold you close</i>
<i>in a thankful heart</i>

1217
01:18:29,617 --> 01:18:31,710
Bob Cratchit?

1218
01:18:34,422 --> 01:18:35,787
So, here you are.

1219
01:18:35,857 --> 01:18:37,882
M-M-M-Mr. Scrooge.

1220
01:18:38,259 --> 01:18:41,456
You, sir, were not at work this morning
as we had discussed.

1221
01:18:41,529 --> 01:18:44,327
But, Mr. Scrooge, sir,
we did discuss it.

1222
01:18:44,399 --> 01:18:46,663
It's Christmas Day.
You gave me the day off.

1223
01:18:46,734 --> 01:18:47,826
I?

1224
01:18:47,902 --> 01:18:50,370
I, Ebenezer Scrooge?

1225
01:18:50,438 --> 01:18:52,303
- Would I do a thing like that?
- No.

1226
01:18:52,373 --> 01:18:54,136
I mean, yes, but you did.

1227
01:18:54,209 --> 01:18:56,177
Bob Cratchit, I've had my fill of this.

1228
01:18:56,244 --> 01:18:59,008
And I have had my fill of you,
Mr. Scrooge.

1229
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:00,638
And therefore, Bob Cratchit...

1230
01:19:00,715 --> 01:19:03,115
And therefore,
you can leave this house at once.

1231
01:19:03,184 --> 01:19:05,550
And therefore,
I'm about to raise your salary.

1232
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:09,454
And I am about to raise you
right off the pavement...

1233
01:19:09,524 --> 01:19:10,616
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

1234
01:19:10,692 --> 01:19:12,159
Yes, Bob.

1235
01:19:12,227 --> 01:19:13,888
Raise your salary.

1236
01:19:13,962 --> 01:19:16,897
And pay your mortgage
on this house.

1237
01:19:18,733 --> 01:19:20,633
Please, sir, come inside.

1238
01:19:20,702 --> 01:19:21,964
Yes, yes.

1239
01:19:22,036 --> 01:19:25,369
Bob Cratchit, would you and your family
care to join us

1240
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:29,069
for a little turkey dinner
on this fine Christmas Day?

1241
01:19:29,143 --> 01:19:31,134
Merry Christmas.

1242
01:19:41,256 --> 01:19:43,690
[Dickens] And Scrooge
was better than his word.

1243
01:19:43,758 --> 01:19:46,488
He did it all, and infinitely more.

1244
01:19:46,561 --> 01:19:48,461
And, er, Tiny Tim?

1245
01:19:48,529 --> 01:19:50,087
And Tiny Tim,

1246
01:19:50,164 --> 01:19:51,791
who did not die...

1247
01:19:51,866 --> 01:19:53,390
Isn't that swell?

1248
01:19:53,468 --> 01:19:56,733
To Tiny Tim,
Scrooge became a second father.

1249
01:19:56,804 --> 01:19:59,466
He became as good a friend,
as good a master,

1250
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:03,306
and as good a man
as the good old city ever had.

1251
01:20:03,378 --> 01:20:06,438
It was always said of him that
he knew how to keep Christmas well,

1252
01:20:06,514 --> 01:20:08,880
if any man alive
possessed the knowledge.

1253
01:20:08,950 --> 01:20:13,182
May that truly be said of us
and all of us.

1254
01:20:13,254 --> 01:20:15,779
And so, as Tiny Tim observed...

1255
01:20:15,857 --> 01:20:18,826
- God bless us.
- God bless us.

1256
01:20:18,893 --> 01:20:20,622
Every one.

1257
01:20:22,230 --> 01:20:25,495
<i>The love we found</i>

1258
01:20:25,566 --> 01:20:29,127
<i>The love we found</i>

1259
01:20:29,203 --> 01:20:31,728
<i>We carry with us</i>

1260
01:20:31,806 --> 01:20:35,902
<i>So we're never quite alone</i>

1261
01:20:36,911 --> 01:20:40,506
<i>The love we found</i>

1262
01:20:40,581 --> 01:20:43,482
<i>The love we found</i>

1263
01:20:44,485 --> 01:20:47,181
<i>The sweetest dream</i>

1264
01:20:47,255 --> 01:20:51,555
<i>That we have ever known</i>

1265
01:20:51,626 --> 01:20:54,527
Hey, say goodbye!

1266
01:20:55,730 --> 01:20:58,631
<i>The love we found</i>

1267
01:21:00,101 --> 01:21:02,092
Goodbye, goodbye.

1268
01:21:02,170 --> 01:21:06,607
<i>So we're never quite alone</i>

1269
01:21:07,542 --> 01:21:09,373
[Rizzo] Nice story, Mr. Dickens.

1270
01:21:09,444 --> 01:21:12,709
[Dickens] Thanks. If you like this,
you should read the book.

<i>It's in the singing</i>

1285
01:21:58,926 --> 01:22:04,489
[Ghost of Christmas Present]
Oh, Yes! Make it last all year.

1286
01:22:04,565 --> 01:22:06,533
<i>It's in the giving of a gift</i>
