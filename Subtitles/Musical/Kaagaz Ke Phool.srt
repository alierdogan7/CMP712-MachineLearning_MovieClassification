1
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,691
Yes, he is entering
a film studio.

2
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,565
Wonder how many films
have been made in this studio.

3
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:50,694
Many are made, and how many
more will continue to be made.

4
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,369
But this studio has not changed.

5
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,898
And neither have
the surroundings.

6
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:57,905
Everything is the same.

7
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:04,115
Only the films and the ones
who make them, keep changing.

8
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:10,115
There was a time when he
used to also make films here.

9
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:51,152
"I saw"

10
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:58,664
"how loyal the world is"

11
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,440
"Everyone parted"

12
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:15,177
"one by one"

13
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:39,202
"With what shall
I meet the world"

14
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:47,219
"I have nothing but tears"

15
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:56,227
"Where there are flowers
on my path"

16
00:04:57,263 --> 00:05:03,199
"Now I can't even expect thorns"

17
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:10,842
"Selfish is the world"

18
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,649
"Everyone parted"

19
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:23,517
"one by one"

20
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:30,117
"Time is merciful"

21
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:33,120
"Desires are young"

22
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:37,125
"To think about tomorrow"

23
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:40,662
..."we have no time"

24
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,156
"Let this trend go on"

25
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:09,361
"Let times keep changing"

26
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:30,238
Madam, Mr. Sinha has walked in
at the second chime.

27
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:33,036
The second number
must win today!

28
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,243
Shame!

29
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:41,442
I've composed a superb tune. Sir
chose it as soon as he heard it!

30
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,789
It's composed for the scene...

31
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:49,453
...when Devdas is going
on a bullock cart.

32
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,261
Okay, sing it.

33
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:54,261
As you wish.
It's in perfect harmony.

34
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:58,264
The pace of the
bullock cart will be slow.

35
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:03,464
And equally slow will be
the rhythm of my tune.

36
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,210
Slow... real slow.

37
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:09,276
Stop that and sing the tune.

38
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:12,814
As you wish.
There were no lyrics...

39
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:16,286
...so I have used
some rubbish...

40
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:19,887
Sir... as you wish.

41
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,760
Suresh will
never make such a mistake.

42
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:25,990
And why do you forget that
you are enacting Paro's role?

43
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,498
The heroine of Devdas.
Isn't that enough?

44
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,497
- Enough? Of course, it is!
- Very much so!

45
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:37,776
Mr. Sinha will not give me
silk saris for this role.

46
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,640
I cannot apply make-up
or adorn my tresses!

47
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:46,714
Would I look like
a heroine or a nag then?

48
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,123
It's one and the same.

49
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,527
What were you saying?

50
00:09:56,228 --> 00:10:00,130
Kanta absolutely despises
the role of Paro.

51
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:05,935
I mean, make the character
a little more glamourous.

52
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,697
Please! For my sake!

53
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,342
You will have to change
as per the character.

54
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,343
The character will not
change for you!

55
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:19,073
Don't change it much.
I want a beauty spot here...

56
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,948
...and a few ringlets.

57
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,555
- Not even one!
- Not even a stylish hairdo?

58
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,817
No. You have to be very simple.

59
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,958
Then, I' m sorry, I will
not work in this film!

60
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,366
You are being unfair.
She can have a stylish hairdo.

61
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:39,571
Yes.

62
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:41,237
If you want a stylish hairdo...

63
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,773
...then get the film made
by somebody else!

64
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,375
What!

65
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:51,174
Your hairdo will remain simple!

66
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:59,248
I deeply regret, but your
hairdo will remain simple.

67
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:10,928
Good-day, sir.

68
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:26,578
"Fame is very short lived here"

69
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:33,191
"Happiness disappears
with the night"

70
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:54,446
"Momentary happiness it is"

71
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,242
"all"

72
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:31,672
"Increases"

73
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:38,955
"Increases my restlessness"

74
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:30,137
Daddy, when did you come
from Bombay? Just now?

75
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:31,209
Yes, dear.

76
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,077
You had not seen my father,
right?

77
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:42,015
Do one thing.
Lock me in the museum here...

78
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:45,022
...so that your friends can
see me to their heart's content.

79
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,562
Pammi, you also go.

80
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,269
Pammi also? Why?

81
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:02,033
I' m sorry, you cannot meet Pammi.
These are her mother's orders.

82
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,166
But she is my daughter too.

83
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,107
But you are not her guardian.

84
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,043
Her mother has enrolled her
in our school.

85
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,774
We cannot disobey her orders.

86
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,317
Who?

87
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:54,219
You appear a bit perturbed,
seeing me here.

88
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:05,826
Good conduct is followed in
this house rigidly. Please sit.

89
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:21,110
Lulu's voice appears a bit
feeble. Does it have a cold?

90
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:26,153
Meet Rita, Suresh.
The new member of our family.

91
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,853
Actually, I have come to meet
another member of your family.

92
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,662
Your daughter.

93
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:38,668
Tell my daughter that...

94
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,872
...her husband
conveys his regards to her.

95
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,144
I am coming from Dehradun.

96
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:53,383
As per your orders, I was
not allowed to meet Pammi.

97
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:59,153
I am sure, dear, that Lulu has
caught a cold. Or its voice...

98
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,688
I have been feeding
it brandy day and night.

99
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,212
Goodbye.

100
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,923
Madam says that
she will not meet you.

101
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,194
How is the weather in Mumbai?

102
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:42,456
I have not come to
discuss the weather.

103
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:45,728
I want to decide something
regarding Pammi.

104
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:52,342
You have wasted your time.
We had decided that years ago.

105
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,947
Years ago, your daughter left
my house out of her choice.

106
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,544
But now, why are you forcefully
snatching away Pammi from me?

107
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:03,751
Now? You forget that Pammi's
been staying with her mother...

108
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,354
...since years.

109
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,959
That's because a small child
always needs its mother.

110
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,963
But now, my daughter
will stay with me.

111
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:15,364
Will Sir B.B. Verma's grandchild
live...

112
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,128
...in a wretched world of films?

113
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:23,975
There must be nobody
as unfortunate as us, Suresh.

114
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:28,571
Living in a high society,
we feel ashamed to say...

115
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,238
...our girl is married.

116
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,385
As then, people ask us
what her husband does.

117
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:39,320
Why didn't we learn
before the wedding...

118
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:42,792
...that someday, you'd join
the world of films?

119
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:47,988
I don't understand! I ask, why
do you consider it to be so bad?

120
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:52,598
Look, Suresh, only good things
are mentioned in this house.

121
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,666
Nothing bad is spoken!
Speak about something else.

122
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:01,805
Then, listen to my final words.
Nobody can snatch Pammi from me.

123
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:04,015
Neither you nor your daughter.

124
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:07,176
The doors of the Court are open
to everyone. Try your luck.

125
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:11,617
What! You want to take
familial matters to Court?

126
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:14,817
Familial? I have implicit trust
in the justice of the British.

127
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,028
I don't want to argue with you.

128
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,296
I' II settle matters
only with Beena.

129
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:04,872
This is the best formula to cure
the headache you get in this zoo

130
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,078
The best prescription - brandy!

131
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:11,080
First listen to
the dosages prescribed.

132
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:13,681
If you want to meet
the old man, have one drop.

133
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:16,083
If you want to meet the
old woman, have two drops.

134
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:19,357
And if you want to meet Beena...

135
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:23,690
...then a whole bottle
also will not suffice.

136
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:28,361
She declined to meet me.

137
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:38,374
Ask Rocky what it is to spend
your life with these women!

138
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:46,377
You come only once a year.

139
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:49,844
Look at me. I am 35 years
and 4 months old.

140
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:54,114
But I have spent
36 years with women!

141
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:15,646
How is Jimmy feeling?

142
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:21,151
He's okay now. The doctor
has fed it plenty of grams.

143
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:31,685
Jimmy seems quite healthy.

144
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:35,893
Dr. Singh's treatment is amazing!
Where is Dr. Singh?

145
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:12,669
I was asking for Dr. Singh.

146
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:16,001
The one with a shirt,
not the one with a blouse.

147
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,675
I am Dr. Singh's daughter.

148
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:25,012
If you are Mr. Rakesh, then
I' m very pleased to meet you.

149
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,488
This is not a horse's hand.

150
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,555
Well, where is your 'pap'?

151
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:40,561
He isn't here today.
I have treated Jimmy.

152
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,031
You did?!

153
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:47,762
Yes. And I will have to come for
some days as papa is not well.

154
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,636
That's really nice!

155
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:57,237
I mean, you coming. Jimmy started
recovering the moment you came.

156
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,579
And I... never mind!

157
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:03,847
Your papa has typhoid, which
lasts for 40 days, right?

158
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:06,423
No! He has a cold,
which lasts for 2 days!

159
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:11,595
Even then he can't visit
the stable.

160
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:14,257
Suppose the horses sneeze, then?

161
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:30,281
Fool!

162
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:38,008
Have you caught a cold?

163
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:48,157
I mean, the weather
is quite strange.

164
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:54,365
Excuse me, but are you mute?

165
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,632
It's futile asking my name.

166
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,363
I' II be eating
at the hostel this evening.

167
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:00,995
I don't like watching films!

168
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,368
- What!
- Yes!

169
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,638
But why are you telling me
all this?

170
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:09,538
Because this is what I have
heard about gentlemen nowadays!

171
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:12,047
If they meet a girl alone,
then...

172
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,378
...number one, it's hello.
Number two, it's the weather.

173
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:15,783
Number three, ask her name.

174
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,548
Number four, invite her
for lunch or a film.

175
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:19,179
- Number five...
- That's enough.

176
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:20,982
Then, I am half a gentleman.

177
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:23,894
Do not fear. I do not go
beyond number two.

178
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,659
- Really?
- Absolutely.

179
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:29,392
I' m so sorry, I misunderstood...

180
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:33,404
Number one, cold.
Number two, it's so chilly.

181
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:35,405
Why didn't you bring your coat?

182
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,678
One gets a cold for free.

183
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:43,812
But one needs money
for a warm coat.

184
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:49,613
- Take this.
- You...

185
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:50,812
Take.

186
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:55,424
- But what about you?
- I won't catch a cold.

187
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,920
I've had a little brandy.

188
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:01,591
You have had alcohol?

189
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:10,430
I believe, people really
misbehave after having alcohol.

190
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:15,103
Some people drink to forget
how others misbehave.

191
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:17,041
Really?

192
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:24,444
Hey! I forgot, I had to catch
a train to Mumbai in 20 minutes.

193
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:30,859
Excuse me!

194
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,277
Hey, fool! Have you brought an
extra or somebody from the road?!

195
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:52,279
If you repeat this,
I shall not spare you!

196
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:55,486
Make do this time.
The next time...

197
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:58,284
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

198
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:05,496
The background lighting
is ready.

199
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:12,503
Mount the camera on the crane
and get it till here.

200
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,765
Do the lighting, and I' II come.

201
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,509
Hey, you! All the extras have
gone to the sets...

202
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,305
...and you' re still here!

203
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:22,308
I' II leave now.

204
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:25,311
Take care of the baby.

205
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,781
I ask, why didn't you go?!
...Why don't you answer?

206
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:31,321
The child was wailing as it
was hungry, so I was feeding it.

207
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:33,319
If you don't have time
from your child...

208
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:35,321
...then why have you
come to work!

209
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,122
Yes, sir?

210
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,869
There is no need to hurry.

211
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:48,335
Put the child to sleep
and report to the sets.

212
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:49,801
Yes, sir.

213
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:57,946
Come here, dear.

214
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:00,949
What's your name?

215
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:10,359
Take this.

216
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:38,179
What do you want?

217
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:41,183
Is there a film director,
Mr. Sinha, in this company?

218
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,854
- I was waiting for you.
- The shooting rushes have come.

219
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:49,600
Book a theatre
during lunch break.

220
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:27,035
Where did she come from?

221
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:30,140
Hey, which fool made this woman
stand in the middle?

222
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,641
There's a coat in this.

223
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:36,810
Yes. During the rains...
I mean, in Delhi.

224
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:39,245
You had given it to me
under the banyan tree.

225
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:46,816
Yes! Have you come here
to return the coat?

226
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,927
Yes... No! I came to Mumbai
in search of a job.

227
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:52,461
I found your card and address
in the coat, so I came here.

228
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:56,462
I see. Let me take the shot first
I' II speak to you after that.

229
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:59,192
Gupta, give her a chair.

230
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:10,479
Get the clapperboard.

231
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:45,181
Bring the crane down.

232
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:50,321
- Print number 10 and 11.
- Okay, sir.

233
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:52,116
Sir, the girl who had come...

234
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:53,451
Oh yes! Where is she?

235
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,856
She has left. She's left this
coat and letter in your name.

236
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,323
My spectacles.

237
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:03,991
Please read this.

238
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,909
What have you done?
Why did you print this shot?

239
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,549
Wait. Let it go.

240
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:43,570
I needed just this kind
of a face for Paro's role.

241
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:46,777
Fetch this girl wherever
she is. Immediately!

242
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:50,512
But if I don't know her name and
address, then in this big city...

243
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:52,583
If you don't know, then find
every nook and corner of the city.

244
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:54,580
Spread the news,
and in the newspapers...

245
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:09,800
Walk a little.

246
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:18,809
Show your profile.

247
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,614
Please smile a little.

248
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:40,160
Her teeth must be spoilt!

249
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:42,290
Madam, why do you look
so gloomy?!

250
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,833
Have you come here to become a
heroine...

251
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:45,425
...or to mourn for somebody?!

252
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:48,096
Lady, becoming a heroine
is no child's play!

253
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:51,834
If you can't show your teeth,
then deliver a line.

254
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,433
Repeat after me...

255
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:55,846
What!

256
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,443
I cannot act! I...

257
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:08,248
I will not become an actress.
I will not.

258
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:12,124
Did you hear?

259
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,528
Why do you want to push her
into becoming a heroine?

260
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:16,867
The girl is okay to look at,
but she has a very plain face.

261
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:21,002
The face should be lively too.

262
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:23,140
But she just does not
know how to smile!

263
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,674
She could not repeat
what I said.

264
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,673
Make her a heroine
in a silent film!

265
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:30,676
She will not become a heroine!
I have made up my mind!

266
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:34,885
Gupta, apply make-up for the
girl and bring her to the sets.

267
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:36,010
What!

268
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:39,223
Decide whatever you have to,
after the test.

269
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:42,687
Am I the owner of
this company or is he?

270
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:44,690
You are, undoubtedly!

271
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:45,547
What I would always imagine...

272
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:47,749
...you are exactly that way!

273
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:52,295
My eyes were searching for
someone just like you...

274
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:54,228
...since a long time.

275
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:55,299
What?

276
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,128
The same simplicity
and innocence.

277
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:02,472
You are indeed Paro.

278
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:05,134
Pardon? My name is Shanti.

279
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:11,311
Yes, the one whom you had
given your coat to.

280
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:13,140
Paro must be somebody else.

281
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:18,250
Yes. Paro is Devdas' heroine.

282
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,256
The role that
I want to give you.

283
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:25,587
But you have seen that your
companions have failed me.

284
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:28,790
It' II be good if you forgive me.
I will not be able to act.

285
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:30,660
I am happy the way I am.

286
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:34,998
What do you do?

287
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:38,007
I have quite a big job.
I get Rs.90 at Modern Chemist.

288
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,804
Just Rs.10 less than 100!

289
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:44,742
Do you know what you will get
working for our company?

290
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:46,815
1,000.

291
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:49,413
- One...
- Thousand.

292
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,424
- You will act now, won't you?
- Just wait.

293
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:05,832
1,000? To lead a luxurious life,
at the most, I' II need 150.

294
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,300
The rest? No way!

295
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:11,374
What will a lone girl
do with so much of money?

296
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:17,639
Alone? What about your
parents or relatives?

297
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,306
I have a distant
maternal uncle...

298
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,317
...who has always remained
distant from me.

299
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:22,852
I was raised in an orphanage.

300
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,861
What about your studies then?

301
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:34,792
I used to knit sweaters
to buy my books.

302
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,396
My fingers would be
on the needles...

303
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:39,470
...and my eyes, on the books. This
way, I passed my matriculation.

304
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:43,731
Yes?

305
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:50,875
The more I get to know you,
the more I get certain.

306
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:53,741
You will be a perfect Paro.

307
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:56,685
Do you trust me so much?

308
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:00,352
I cannot express how much.

309
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:03,250
Believe me, you will
be a perfect Paro.

310
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,360
Can you trust me?

311
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:13,899
It's quite strange.

312
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:17,107
For the first time in life...

313
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:20,439
...I trust somebody else
more than myself.

314
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:31,519
Take this. These are
Paro's dialogues.

315
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:29,509
I say, hello.

316
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:33,445
My Jimmy will win this race.

317
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:35,979
Rakesh, meet my new heroine.

318
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,623
You already know her.

319
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:45,525
He hails from
a very high society.

320
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:50,689
Not very high.
Just 5 feet 8 inches tall.

321
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:54,202
I meant, Mr. Rakesh
is married to wealth.

322
00:37:54,572 --> 00:38:00,010
Oh no! I hate the word marriage.

323
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:02,940
You see,
I want to die a bachelor!

324
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:07,513
Where are you staying
in Mumbai? With friends?

325
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:11,221
At the Taj. Since the time I've
left Delhi...

326
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:13,552
...I've been moving freely.

327
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:17,227
There comes my freedom!

328
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:25,224
She is the Health Officer
of all my children.

329
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,238
How many children do you have?

330
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:31,571
I had 8 last year, and 12 now.

331
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:32,734
Twelve?!

332
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:36,405
Five red, and five black.

333
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:39,241
He has four legged
children with tails.

334
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,415
One of them will be
participating in this race.

335
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:43,042
What a child!

336
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:52,888
Cruel man! You have come to
Mumbai, and not even phoned me!

337
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:55,527
It's time for the race.
I' II leave.

338
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:01,721
Mr. Sinha.

339
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:12,663
You?

340
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:19,909
Come here.

341
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:31,910
A hairdo? Show me your hand.

342
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:35,223
These nails!

343
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:39,429
Eyebrows shaped! I ask,
what is all this?!

344
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:45,094
Well... for this party, she...

345
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:46,436
I see!

346
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:50,235
So now, you are more interested
in parties than your work.

347
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:53,705
I never expected you
to get swayed so soon...

348
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:55,438
...by the razzmatazz here!

349
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,245
Mr. Sinha.

350
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:01,713
Mr. Sinha. Please listen to me.

351
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:04,719
Listen indeed! Your shooting
will be held tomorrow.

352
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:08,258
You have to become Paro.
An innocent, simple Indian girl.

353
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:11,052
How can I shoot with that
wild creeper on your head?!

354
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:14,464
It won't straighten for 10 days!

355
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:19,458
But I didn't know that
this appearance would be...

356
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,195
You probably think that
you look very beautiful!

357
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:24,474
You look like a monkey
right now!

358
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,269
- What?
- Yes!

359
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,274
You have messed up a
lovely, innocent face!

360
00:42:29,513 --> 00:42:30,980
Before getting misled
by anyone...

361
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:32,878
...you should have
at least asked me!

362
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:35,611
Your simplicity held
so much... so much of charisma.

363
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,818
- What?
- Of course! Am I joking?!

364
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:42,492
I had heard of an ugly duckling
turning into a swan.

365
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:44,083
But for the first time...

366
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:46,094
...I've seen a swan turning
into an ugly duckling!

367
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,298
Go and enjoy your party!

368
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:03,977
- Just see if
they are ready or not. - Okay.

369
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:26,331
- Is it okay?
- Absolutely.

370
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:28,531
How did you manage to
straighten them so soon?

371
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:30,533
I was busy with it
the whole night.

372
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:33,138
The whole night?
Didn't you sleep?

373
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:35,871
No. You had said that I am more
interested in parties...

374
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,345
...than my work.

375
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:39,139
- I said that only...
- Everything is ready.

376
00:43:57,601 --> 00:44:00,161
I scolded you a lot
last night, didn't I?

377
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,367
You called me a monkey.

378
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:06,735
I wonder
why I scolded you so much.

379
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:11,775
I have never reprimanded
any heroine like that before.

380
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:14,982
Nobody else?

381
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:20,185
I would get angry with them, but
lacked the courage to scold them

382
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:25,390
Shall I say why?
Because you are decent.

383
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:27,263
- Really?
- Yes.

384
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:30,400
No decent man can shout
at a woman who is not his own.

385
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:36,866
What are you thinking about?

386
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:42,100
You must have felt
quite offended yesterday.

387
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:45,340
No. Henceforth, I will never
feel offended if you scold me.

388
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:47,173
I understand quite a lot now.

389
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:49,209
What do you understand?

390
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:54,613
That you are...
you are like a walnut!

391
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:56,420
Hard on the surface,
but soft from within.

392
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:49,270
"Rustles the wind"

393
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:53,080
"It whispers to us"

394
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:05,491
"New desires awaken"

395
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:08,493
"It will keep bluffing us"

396
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:21,976
"Fragrant is my mind"

397
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:31,112
"Mischievously my heart says
Come in my arms"

398
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:35,519
"This breeze drives us crazy"

399
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,323
"My heart wishes to fly"

400
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:41,385
"Excited it is
It does not listen to me"

401
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:44,794
"This wind..."

402
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:48,030
"...torments us"

403
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:51,794
"It's breathtaking"

404
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:55,303
"This breeze drives us crazy"

405
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:35,170
Yes, she is here.

406
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:40,850
Madam... madam.

407
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:46,651
Let me sleep.

408
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:49,859
It's 11.30. There's a
trunk call from Mumbai.

409
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:14,350
What! Suresh has met
with an accident?

410
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:20,685
I am sorry to hear about it.

411
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:24,416
How's he?

412
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:31,696
If he needs me, then send him
here immediately by plane.

413
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:34,499
He will be completely
attended to, here.

414
00:49:35,939 --> 00:49:39,705
What?
No, I cannot come there.

415
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:43,404
I told you, I cannot come there.

416
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:45,915
It's impossible.

417
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:50,912
What happened?
Won't Mrs. Sinha come?

418
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:51,988
No.

419
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:54,514
Surprising!

420
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:57,722
At such a time, if someone close
to Mr. Sinha...

421
00:49:57,961 --> 00:49:59,326
...could stay with him, then...

422
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:03,126
Anyway, a nurse will remain
with him 24 hours a day.

423
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:05,728
I've given him
a morphine injection.

424
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:09,427
- Let him rest for 10-12 hours.
- Very well.

425
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:12,532
- Let's go.
- Yes.

426
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:16,735
Nurse, phone me as soon as
Mr. Sinha regains consciousness.

427
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:22,414
- Should I reach you home?
- No.

428
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:26,750
I have called for a taxi.
Carry on. I' II go on my own.

429
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:27,957
Okay.

430
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:54,982
Water.

431
00:50:57,421 --> 00:50:58,786
Water.

432
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:45,635
- Where were you, nurse?
- I was...

433
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:48,435
I hate to be dependent
on others.

434
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:51,836
But these eyes...

435
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:59,549
Right now, there is nobody else
other than you to look after me.

436
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:08,049
- Is it raining outside?
- Yes.

437
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:11,060
Let me stay in this room.

438
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:15,724
I love the sound of the rains.

439
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:27,076
It was raining
the other day too.

440
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:30,475
And the poor girl
didn't even have a coat.

441
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:34,606
Nurse, how is Shanti?

442
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:38,087
She was also with me
in that accident.

443
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:40,885
I am still with you.

444
00:52:41,124 --> 00:52:43,888
Who's it?

445
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:45,253
Yes.

446
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:52,897
You are perfectly okay,
aren't you?

447
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:55,698
Yes, I am. Have some water.

448
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:11,280
Oh yes! How did you know
that I was thirsty?

449
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:14,654
It's been more than 13 hours
since you have had water.

450
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:19,390
And I know that you are used
to drinking water every 2 hours.

451
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:25,733
Where are the servants?

452
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:28,133
They are sleeping. It's 2 a.m.

453
00:53:29,172 --> 00:53:35,941
It's quite late at night. Ask
the driver to reach you home.

454
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:45,748
You aren't asking me
to stay back?

455
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,947
I want...

456
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:52,787
I don't want you to undergo
any trouble because of me.

457
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:55,960
Then, ask me not to leave.

458
00:53:58,201 --> 00:54:03,901
No. It's better that you do.

459
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:28,391
- What is it?
- Nothing.

460
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:46,715
Hey, she's come!

461
00:54:47,851 --> 00:54:49,375
Why are you laughing?

462
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:57,218
Praises have been showered about
your father in this magazine.

463
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:00,022
Really? What's written?

464
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:02,493
- Shall I read it?
- Yes. Why do you even ask?

465
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:04,032
Let's read it for her.

466
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:14,576
Renowned director Suresh Sinha
has chosen a new heroine...

467
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:16,236
...for his film.

468
00:55:16,446 --> 00:55:19,574
It's said that this girl
used to sell medicines earlier.

469
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:23,514
And is now curing
Mr. Sinha's heart ailment.

470
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:28,053
One hopes that Mr. Sinha
has taken full advantage...

471
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:31,260
...of her therapeutic expertise.
...What does it mean?

472
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:33,259
My father is not like that!

473
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:34,762
You have always lived
away from him.

474
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:36,729
So how would you know
what he's like?

475
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,063
I know! I know
everything about him!

476
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:42,066
If you do, then tell us which
film he is directing nowadays.

477
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:45,740
I... I do not know.

478
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:49,003
- What is his new heroine's name?
- I do not know that either.

479
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:51,774
- Why doesn't your mother
live with him? - I do not know!

480
00:55:51,915 --> 00:55:54,281
Do you know
your dad's name or not?

481
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:57,678
What! What did you say?
I' II kill you!

482
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:06,295
I' II kill you if you speak ill
about my father!

483
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:15,864
Nobody has yet come
to the studio.

484
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:18,367
Why have you come so early?

485
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:23,873
Even you have come very early.

486
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:28,637
I have a habit of coming a few
hours before shooting begins...

487
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:30,042
I know.

488
00:57:31,414 --> 00:57:34,781
Really? What else
do you know about me?

489
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:36,646
Everything.

490
00:57:40,423 --> 00:57:42,983
Perhaps, that's why you did not
come to inquire about me...

491
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:44,992
...after that night.

492
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:47,729
You had asked me not to.

493
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:51,801
I had asked you to leave.

494
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:54,196
I didn't prevent you
from coming the next day.

495
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:00,037
So, you wanted me to come?

496
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:10,419
Whom are you knitting
the sweater for?

497
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,010
There is someone.

498
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:17,221
Mr. Someone or Miss Someone.

499
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,825
Mr. Someone.

500
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:25,926
But you had once said that
you have nobody in this world.

501
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:28,903
Then, how did this someone...

502
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:32,771
He is just like me... all alone.

503
00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:16,747
Perhaps you do not know
that I have a family.

504
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:19,287
I know.

505
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:58,521
"What a sweet calamity
has befallen us"

506
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:07,128
"We are no more the same"

507
01:00:43,006 --> 01:00:49,377
"Restless hearts united..."

508
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:56,381
"...As if they were
never apart"

509
01:01:12,301 --> 01:01:18,399
"We both are lost..."

510
01:01:19,642 --> 01:01:25,774
"...on the same path"

511
01:01:27,216 --> 01:01:33,212
"What a sweet calamity
has befallen us"

512
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:41,119
"We are no more the same"

513
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:09,454
"Don't know where to go"

514
01:02:10,693 --> 01:02:17,462
"Tried to walk away,
But no destination"

515
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:39,284
"Don't know what is my goal"

516
01:02:40,723 --> 01:02:47,492
"Hearts weave dreams"

517
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:54,299
"What a sweet calamity
has befallen us"

518
01:02:55,138 --> 01:03:02,101
"We are no more the same"

519
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:09,378
Didn't you hear what mother said?

520
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:17,379
Your stables in Mumbai...

521
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:21,051
- Look at this!
- I' II leave, pop.

522
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:26,390
Strange man! Only half
his face has a beard.

523
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:30,597
Look, what's written below.

524
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:32,596
It's the picture
of film personalities.

525
01:04:34,837 --> 01:04:36,395
Film personalities!

526
01:04:43,846 --> 01:04:46,610
You wanted to say something.

527
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:54,823
- About horses.
- About horses!

528
01:04:54,924 --> 01:04:57,222
Rocky,
at your Mumbai stables...

529
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:00,829
I am quite sure that I have
seen this man somewhere.

530
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:02,620
Who, papa?

531
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:04,833
The one whose photo is
in this newspaper.

532
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:12,230
You see him everyday. In fact,
you are seeing him even now.

533
01:05:14,877 --> 01:05:17,243
The moustache and the beard
have been drawn with a pencil.

534
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,007
Why did you leave
the job incomplete?

535
01:05:20,883 --> 01:05:22,510
It's your photograph!

536
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:32,117
It's such a shame, papa!

537
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:35,193
Suresh is not concerned about
our family's honour...

538
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:36,856
...as he is an outsider.

539
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:39,526
But now, even a son from this
family is heading towards films!

540
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:42,200
My son! I cannot believe it!

541
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:44,873
Mom, answer papa.

542
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:46,339
First, you answer me.

543
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:49,876
How did you land up
with those cheap film people?!

544
01:05:50,913 --> 01:05:52,210
In a taxi.

545
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:59,420
Firstly, Sir B.B. Verma's son went
to cheap film personalities...

546
01:05:59,522 --> 01:06:01,490
...and that too,
in an ordinary taxi!

547
01:06:01,924 --> 01:06:03,892
What they must be
thinking about us?

548
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:06,689
They do not think about us.

549
01:06:10,933 --> 01:06:14,699
Look at the way Rocky
is looking at this actress.

550
01:06:25,948 --> 01:06:29,509
Even Suresh used to look at me
that way before marriage.

551
01:06:29,618 --> 01:06:31,711
Suresh was wise
before he got married.

552
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:41,452
It's a family matter.
Let it remain in stock.

553
01:06:41,564 --> 01:06:43,532
I' II take it back
some other time.

554
01:07:35,618 --> 01:07:36,983
Who are you?

555
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:44,993
He is my father.

556
01:07:51,033 --> 01:07:53,593
- Your?
- Daddy.

557
01:07:56,305 --> 01:08:00,799
Why have you put up only
my father's photograph here?

558
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:05,546
Why are you quiet? Answer me.

559
01:08:11,654 --> 01:08:13,622
Whose photograph will I put up
then?

560
01:08:14,056 --> 01:08:17,822
I have no relative or friend.

561
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:20,028
Implying, my father means
everything to you?

562
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:25,624
When did you come from school?

563
01:08:26,068 --> 01:08:28,036
Will you be staying
with your father?

564
01:08:28,137 --> 01:08:31,300
Answer my question first!
And then, I will answer yours.

565
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:35,041
What... what answer do I give?

566
01:08:35,744 --> 01:08:37,837
- You are still a child.
- I am not a child!

567
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:40,538
I have run away from school
and come to you.

568
01:08:40,683 --> 01:08:42,548
Can a child do this?!

569
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:45,451
Run away?

570
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:50,559
You should not have done this.

571
01:08:50,693 --> 01:08:52,320
Why have you run away
and come here?

572
01:08:52,428 --> 01:08:55,056
- To fight with you.
- Fight?

573
01:08:57,099 --> 01:08:59,329
I see. Go ahead.

574
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:02,665
But how can you fight well
after a tiresome journey?

575
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:05,073
Freshen up and have some sweets.

576
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:07,471
I will not have any sweets!
Do not deceive me!

577
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:10,078
I know that you don't love me!

578
01:09:15,117 --> 01:09:18,086
- How do you know?
- You are mother's rival!

579
01:09:18,521 --> 01:09:20,489
Then, how can you love
her daughter?

580
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:28,363
You are your father's daughter
too.

581
01:09:31,467 --> 01:09:35,426
And, my dear, I hold no animosity
towards your mother.

582
01:09:36,138 --> 01:09:38,902
You are lying! You are snatching
my father away from my mother!

583
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:41,266
But I will not let
this happen, understand?!

584
01:09:43,145 --> 01:09:46,911
You misunderstand, Pammi.

585
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:50,111
They have been living separately
much before I came here.

586
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:53,117
That's because I was small.
But I have become sensible now.

587
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:55,719
If I try,
then they could be united.

588
01:09:56,158 --> 01:09:58,388
But that will never happen
as long as you are here!

589
01:09:59,161 --> 01:10:01,391
I think you misunderstand me.

590
01:10:01,497 --> 01:10:05,126
Then why have you hung such
a big picture of dad? Answer me!

591
01:10:05,768 --> 01:10:09,932
I told you I am not a child.
I understand everything.

592
01:10:10,172 --> 01:10:11,799
My foot,
you understand everything!

593
01:10:11,974 --> 01:10:13,874
If your parents live separately,
I am not to be blamed...

594
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:15,534
...your mother is!

595
01:10:15,678 --> 01:10:17,737
Who are you to speak ill
about my mother?!

596
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:21,149
Whatever transpires in our
house, is a personal matter.

597
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:23,750
What right do you have, to
interfere in other's lives?!

598
01:10:23,852 --> 01:10:25,945
Then, neither do you have a
right to interfere in mine!

599
01:10:26,789 --> 01:10:28,689
After being subjected to
cruel fate all my life...

600
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:30,588
...I have acquired little
happiness...

601
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:32,160
...for the first time in life.

602
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:35,962
It may be incomplete,
but it means everything to me.

603
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:40,168
I cannot lose it at any cost!

604
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:55,648
You have no parents.

605
01:10:57,219 --> 01:10:58,777
But I do.

606
01:11:00,556 --> 01:11:04,185
There is mother's house
and father's too.

607
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:07,991
And the hostel is my house.

608
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:10,599
All three of us
have separate homes.

609
01:11:12,234 --> 01:11:15,863
My endeavours were to bring
the three of us to live together

610
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:20,470
But you will not let this happen.

611
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:25,009
What do you know about living
like an orphan...

612
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:28,705
...in spite of having parents?!
