(Murmuring)

16
00:00:59,207 --> 00:01:01,641
She cannot be sacrificed
without the ring.

17
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:05,442
Where is the ring?
What has she done with the ring?

18

- At once, without delay.
- The ring.

53
00:03:37,207 --> 00:03:40,677
Over the water we must go.

54
00:03:40,807 --> 00:03:42,763
- Bhuta.
- You ask of me, Master?

55
00:03:42,887 --> 00:03:45,959
- Obedience and Love.
- This is so.

56
00:03:46,087 --> 00:03:47,725
- Ahme.
- This is so.

57
00:03:47,847 --> 00:03:50,407

l am making the immediate
arrangements for my necessary...

59
00:03:53,807 --> 00:03:55,445

- ...visit to England.
- ln hand.

61
00:03:57,687 --> 00:03:59,166
Something must be done.

62
00:03:59,287 --> 00:04:01,755
Without the ring,
there will be no sacrifice,

63
00:04:01,887 --> 00:04:04,117
without the sacrifice,
no congregation.

64
00:04:04,247 --> 00:04:06,238
Without a congregation...

65
00:04:07,087 --> 00:04:09,647
...no more me.

66
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:11,405
This is so.

67
00:04:23,527 --> 00:04:25,882
- Wave.
- l don't like to.

68
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:28,362
- Go on, wave.
- Shall l?

69
00:04:28,487 --> 00:04:30,717
They expect it, don't they.

70
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,805
Lovely lads and so natural.

71
00:04:33,927 --> 00:04:36,236
Adoration hasn't gone to their heads.

72
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:38,517
You know what l mean, success.

73
00:04:38,647 --> 00:04:42,526
So natural and still the same
as they was before they was.

74
00:05:10,247 --> 00:05:12,158
(Rattling)

75
00:05:15,447 --> 00:05:17,165
(Organ music plays)

76
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:37,038
- Someone's got hold of my finger.
- You trying to attract attention again?

77
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:39,601
She's pulling at it.

78
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:41,399
(Yells) Oh!

79
00:05:41,527 --> 00:05:43,961
Ow!

80
00:05:50,687 --> 00:05:52,325
She had my finger, you know...

81
00:05:52,447 --> 00:05:55,564
Stop trying to drag things down
to your own level.

82
00:05:55,687 --> 00:06:00,363
l thought she was a sandwich
until she went spare on my hand.

83
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,202
lt's cold. lt's a cold place.

84
00:06:06,687 --> 00:06:10,839
- So, the ring?
- No. l could not get it off, Swami.

85
00:06:11,607 --> 00:06:13,325
Oh dear!

86
00:06:17,887 --> 00:06:19,878
(Engine revs)

88
00:07:39,287 --> 00:07:41,084
(Thuds)

89
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:55,957
Hey! Have you been messing with me
in my kip?

90
00:07:56,087 --> 00:07:58,237
l mean, with a fishing rod.

91
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:02,155
l wouldn't touch you with a plastic one.
What are you doing on the floor?

92
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:04,118
l'm tired.

93
00:08:36,447 --> 00:08:39,325
(Phones ring)

94
00:08:42,367 --> 00:08:44,039
- Hello?
- Hello?

95
00:08:45,487 --> 00:08:47,478
(Alarm clock rings)

96
00:09:02,847 --> 00:09:05,156
Hey, Bea-atle!

97
00:09:05,287 --> 00:09:08,120
How about this, <i>Shufti?</i>

98
00:09:09,127 --> 00:09:11,482
Gold! All of it, pure gold.

99
00:09:11,607 --> 00:09:14,758
ln easy to handle
denominational nuggets. Unmarked.

100
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,481
- Not a mark on them.
- No, l hate them.

101
00:09:17,607 --> 00:09:21,998
- No.
- lt makes your fingers go green.

102
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:26,677
lt's not the Beatle with the ring.

103
00:09:27,487 --> 00:09:30,923
- Aren't l?
- No, unfortunately.

104
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:32,560
(Giggles)

105
00:09:38,087 --> 00:09:39,520
Ah!

106
00:09:40,487 --> 00:09:43,877
Hey, Bea-atle.
You shall have fun, eh?

107
00:09:44,007 --> 00:09:46,567
No thanks, l'm rhythm guitar

108
00:09:49,887 --> 00:09:52,003
l didn't encourage that wink.

109
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,960
- lt is not the one.
- My gosh.

110
00:09:55,087 --> 00:09:58,159
They all look the same in their similitude
and language.

111
00:09:58,287 --> 00:10:01,279
Swami, it's raining on your...

112
00:10:01,407 --> 00:10:03,284

113
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,323

Oh... After them.

(Electronic hum)

122
00:10:57,487 --> 00:10:59,239

Ha, ha!

124

126
00:11:17,047 --> 00:11:18,526

135
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:41,766
Hey! My skin's soaked right through

yes yes, you're going to lose that girl

175
00:15:04,847 --> 00:15:08,556
You're going to lose that girl,
yes yes, you're going to lose that girl

176
00:15:08,687 --> 00:15:14,319
You're going to lose, yes yes,
you're going to lose that girl

177
00:15:16,287 --> 00:15:18,676
(lndistinct chatter)

178
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:22,004
- Boys, are you buzzing?
- No thanks, l've got the car.

179
00:15:22,127 --> 00:15:25,756
No, listen...
You'll have to do it again.

180
00:15:25,887 --> 00:15:30,119
(Over speaker) ' l'll make a point
of taking her away from you

181
00:15:30,247 --> 00:15:32,681
' Watch what you do,
yeah

182
00:15:33,647 --> 00:15:37,925
' The way you treat her,
what else can l do...  '

183
00:15:38,047 --> 00:15:41,039
(Whirring)

184
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:44,325
- ls that you?
- No.

185
00:15:44,447 --> 00:15:46,483
- (Whirring stops)
- Don't look at me.

186
00:15:48,487 --> 00:15:50,159
(Crash)

187
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:53,279
lt was you buzzing.
You naughty boy.

188
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,043
(Electric saw whirrs)

189
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:57,998
(Whispers) Now for the ring!

190
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,796
(Muffled cries)

191
00:16:06,047 --> 00:16:07,400
Ow!

192
00:16:08,687 --> 00:16:10,837
Oh! Oh, that stings.

193
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:13,322
(Yells) Kaili!

194
00:16:13,447 --> 00:16:14,926
Kaili!

195
00:16:15,047 --> 00:16:16,560
(Ahme ) Flee!

196
00:16:16,687 --> 00:16:20,362
Will you explain everything
when the opportunity presents itself?

197
00:16:20,487 --> 00:16:21,966
- Flee!
- OK.

198
00:16:37,047 --> 00:16:38,685
(Gunshot)

199
00:16:51,287 --> 00:16:54,120
Oh, goodness me!
Sex is creeping in.

200
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:58,559
Young people see it in the bazaars,
market places, temple...

201
00:16:58,687 --> 00:17:02,726
No wonder they turn up their noses
at a mystical impulse...

202
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:08,365
We're taking up fox hunting so young
people are involved in their sacrifices.

203
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:12,526
and will understand the deep
significance of blood well shed.

204
00:17:12,647 --> 00:17:17,084
Of course l don't expect you to see
eye to eye with me...

205
00:17:18,407 --> 00:17:22,605
What? Who? Where?

206
00:17:22,727 --> 00:17:26,083
Now... lf you'll pardon me.

207
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:52,800
lt's played out, any road?
You know, rings...

208
00:17:52,927 --> 00:17:54,565
- Very nice.
- lt's yours.

209
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:58,999
Nah! My missus wouldn't wear a ring
like that. Ostentatious, that is!

210
00:17:59,127 --> 00:18:02,164
- He's from the west.
- Nah, east. Stepney.

211
00:18:03,407 --> 00:18:07,195
- Does this ring mean anything to you?
- Freemason?

212
00:18:07,327 --> 00:18:11,036
- You're all English!
- That's what unions are for.

213
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:16,366
l tell a lie. We have got one in there
from the mystic east... Or we did have.

214
00:18:16,487 --> 00:18:18,443
(Hollers) Hey, Abdul!

215
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:21,035
- Yes.
- We did have one, didn't we?

216
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:24,079
That lad from the sunnier climate,
east of Suez?

217
00:18:24,207 --> 00:18:26,596
Very nice he was, too.

218
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:30,515
l think he's still down there,
in the coal hole.

219
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:42,562
Doesn't the blood rush to your head, sir?

220
00:18:42,687 --> 00:18:45,406
Doesn't the eastern flavour
come expensive?

221
00:18:45,527 --> 00:18:47,757
Doesn't the blood rush to your stomach?

222
00:18:47,887 --> 00:18:49,843
ls this ring nasty, sir?

223
00:18:49,967 --> 00:18:54,006
Argh! Kaili! Oh dear, l must lie down.

224
00:18:55,687 --> 00:18:57,803
Oh! That's better.

225
00:19:00,247 --> 00:19:03,159
Excuse me...
This menu...

226
00:19:03,287 --> 00:19:04,925
(Thump)

227
00:19:23,767 --> 00:19:25,883
l've just seen the most amazing thing...

228
00:19:26,007 --> 00:19:27,998
(Gasps) Oh...

229
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:37,439
Hey, did you...

230
00:19:42,287 --> 00:19:45,085
There's a man down there on his head.

231
00:19:46,847 --> 00:19:48,280
Arthur?

232
00:19:49,367 --> 00:19:50,880
(Whooshes)

233
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:54,235
Could you pick this up for me, please?

234
00:19:57,847 --> 00:20:00,680
(Sitar music plays)

235
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:04,480
(Music stops)

236
00:20:06,327 --> 00:20:08,477
Are you eating, too, Paul?

237
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:15,279
Your friend is in mortal danger.
l can say no more.

238
00:20:15,407 --> 00:20:17,398
(Gasping)

239
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:21,165
(Music resumes)

240
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,923
lt's rather a jolly place.

241
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:28,317
- Soup, please.
- Soup, yeah.

242
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:29,960
He has three hours to live.

243
00:20:30,087 --> 00:20:31,759
- Say no more.
- l can say no more.

244
00:20:34,327 --> 00:20:36,158
l ordered soup too.

245
00:20:36,287 --> 00:20:38,881
- Soup!
- Soup.

246
00:20:48,927 --> 00:20:53,796
Pardon me, sir. That's a very
fascinating ring you've got there.

247
00:20:53,927 --> 00:20:56,077
- Unless l'm mistaken.
- ls it?

248
00:20:56,207 --> 00:20:59,517
The dreaded sacred sacrificial
ring of the dread Kaili.

249
00:20:59,647 --> 00:21:01,399
- Say no more.
- l can say no more.

250
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:04,917
Excuse me. lf he is to be sacrificed
before Kaili,

251
00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:06,719
why is he not painted red?

252
00:21:06,847 --> 00:21:12,479
l've never had the courage to ask him,
but as he's my best friend l will.

253
00:21:14,647 --> 00:21:18,037
- What's this? Glasses?
- That's right, sir. Glasses.

254
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:22,001
A victim is offered
to the dread Kaili everyday.

255
00:21:22,127 --> 00:21:23,958
All are happy to go.

256
00:21:24,087 --> 00:21:27,363
He who wins is privileged to wear
the sacred ring

257
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:29,955
from sun to moon,
from moon to sun.

258
00:21:30,087 --> 00:21:33,762
And at the end of the happy day
he is slaughtered jolly with a knife.

259
00:21:33,887 --> 00:21:38,563
And sacrificed jolly with a knife,
so l'm told, with that ring.

260
00:21:38,687 --> 00:21:40,086
Three hours to live.

261
00:21:40,207 --> 00:21:43,756
- (Man) You have till five o'clock.
- Before a new victim is chosen.

262
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:46,879
You are lucky to be chosen!

263
00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:50,556
My old mum would give her right hand
to be chosen.

264
00:21:51,647 --> 00:21:54,957
- What's this?
- A season ticket.

265
00:21:55,087 --> 00:21:58,159
l like a lot of seasoning in my soup.

266
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:02,843
There's somebody been in this soup.

267
00:22:02,967 --> 00:22:06,721
l got it from this Eastern bird... lady...
in a fan letter.

268
00:22:06,847 --> 00:22:09,998
l get all sorts.
Rubbish, though, isn't it? Sacrifice.

269
00:22:11,727 --> 00:22:13,843
No? Come off!

270
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:17,960
So, get in touch with your authorities
and send back the ring to this lady,

271
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,157
who will then go happy to Kaili.

272
00:22:20,287 --> 00:22:22,084
- Thank you.
- (Bhuta) Three hours.

273
00:22:22,687 --> 00:22:24,723
There's a footprint in here.

274
00:22:24,847 --> 00:22:26,963
Here, you have a go.

275
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:30,205
(Gasps) Flee!

276
00:22:36,327 --> 00:22:38,716
(Woman screams)

277
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:58,316
We have lots of little problems like this.
Some of them matrimonial.

278
00:22:58,447 --> 00:22:59,766
(Laughs)

279
00:22:59,887 --> 00:23:01,798
This ring is not stone.

280
00:23:01,927 --> 00:23:05,681
- l've only got three hours to live.
- Therefore, it must be a metal.

281
00:23:13,087 --> 00:23:17,603
- l don't know this metal.
- You're not getting anywhere, are you?

282
00:23:17,727 --> 00:23:21,356
Early days yet, sir.
Therefore it must be an alloy.

283
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:26,607
There's a certain amount of hurry up
involved here. My life is in danger.

284
00:23:26,727 --> 00:23:28,797
Three ten.

285
00:23:28,927 --> 00:23:30,519
- The wheel.
- Not the wheel.

286
00:23:30,647 --> 00:23:34,959
Even the Royal House of Hanover
had the wheel, sir.

287
00:23:35,087 --> 00:23:37,681
(Whirring)

288
00:23:47,447 --> 00:23:50,120
- l've never seen anything like it.
- You've failed.

289
00:23:50,247 --> 00:23:54,240
- l suggest you see a specialist.
- What kind? Your tools are broken.

290
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:57,359
The fire brigade once got my head
out of some railings.

291
00:23:57,487 --> 00:24:01,560
- Did you want them to?
- No. l left it there when not at school.

292
00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:03,962
You can see a lot of the world
from railings.

293
00:24:04,087 --> 00:24:06,396
(Electronic beeping)

294
00:24:09,647 --> 00:24:12,480
l like operations,
they give you a sense of outlook.

295
00:24:13,527 --> 00:24:15,245
This won't work.

296
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:18,359
lt could work if the government
would spend more money.

297
00:24:18,487 --> 00:24:20,284
Made in America you see.

298
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:22,805
Another failure.

299
00:24:22,927 --> 00:24:25,885
The idea is...
The idea as l see it

300
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:30,125
is that we expand the molecules
and the ring grows bigger and drops off.

301
00:24:30,247 --> 00:24:33,956
- What's your electricity bill like?
- lt's sort of a long counterfoil.

302
00:24:34,087 --> 00:24:36,282
lt's not dropping off.

303
00:24:38,527 --> 00:24:42,202
Voltage!
Voltage...up, up...

304
00:24:42,327 --> 00:24:43,646
Up, up!

305
00:24:43,767 --> 00:24:47,316
- Are you sure l'm earthed?
- Oh no, hold on. Thank you.

306
00:24:47,447 --> 00:24:50,484
Made in America.
Streets ahead of anything we've got.

307
00:24:50,607 --> 00:24:52,643
This is English.

308
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:56,282
- ls it green, the earth in America?
- ln some places it's brown.

309
00:24:56,407 --> 00:24:57,920
He's not earthed.

310
00:24:58,047 --> 00:25:02,040
He's an idiot.
Has a degree in woodwork. l ask you!

311
00:25:05,367 --> 00:25:06,880
Done.

312
00:25:08,527 --> 00:25:10,802
- 5... 4...
- Come on.

313
00:25:11,527 --> 00:25:16,442
3-2-1 -go! l observe the procedure.
He'll thank me for it in the end.

314
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:18,797
Scientist, you're getting nowhere.

315
00:25:18,927 --> 00:25:22,761
lt's the plugs.
Good British plugs.

316
00:25:22,887 --> 00:25:27,005
All this America rig. Wrong voltage.
That's what foxes me.

317
00:25:27,127 --> 00:25:29,243
- How do you feel?
- l used to use my hands.

318
00:25:29,367 --> 00:25:31,358
He used to use his hands.

319
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:36,159
- Will he still be able to drum?
- Did he do a lot of it?

320
00:25:36,287 --> 00:25:39,404
- Voltage...up!
- l'm no mean hand at the old sticks.

321
00:25:41,687 --> 00:25:43,439
The voltage, up, up, up!

322
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:46,877
- Hey, he's calling you. Up, up, up!
- Up, up, up!

323
00:25:48,767 --> 00:25:50,564
The bunker!

324
00:25:52,687 --> 00:25:54,723
(Electronic humming)

325
00:25:59,607 --> 00:26:03,486
- l can't watch.
- lt's working! Give it the gun, Algernon.

326
00:26:03,607 --> 00:26:05,723
(Whirring)

327
00:26:10,887 --> 00:26:12,525
Stop it!

328
00:26:12,647 --> 00:26:14,603
lt's more than my job's worth!

329
00:26:14,727 --> 00:26:17,799
He's out to rule the world
if he can get a government grant.

330
00:26:17,927 --> 00:26:20,839
Outrageous!
You're nothing but a mad scientist!

331
00:26:31,887 --> 00:26:33,525
Fantastic!

332
00:26:33,647 --> 00:26:37,720
With a ring like that l could,
dare l say it, rule the world.

333
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:40,805
l must have the ring...
Algernon, the laser.

334
00:26:40,927 --> 00:26:44,840
Get your hands off him
or l'll call the Metropolitan scuffers!

335
00:26:44,967 --> 00:26:46,605
The laser...

336
00:26:46,727 --> 00:26:50,515
- Get him off.
- l must have this ring. The laser.

337
00:26:51,247 --> 00:26:56,446
Halt! Release him or l'll shoot
and l am a dead eyeshot shooting.

338
00:26:56,567 --> 00:26:59,001
- l've got it.
- Switch off that machine.

339
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:04,483
- The laser.
- The laser, yes...

340
00:27:04,607 --> 00:27:07,758
l'm better with animals

She's had your fingers before, Ringo.

Well, that was a mistake.

lt's the wrong plug...
Just give me five minutes.

351
00:27:43,087 --> 00:27:46,921
lt's the brain drain.
His brain's draining.

Now see what you've done
with your filthy Eastern ways.

376
00:30:03,967 --> 00:30:07,642
No! lt is Clang, the High Priest,
who is filthy in his ways.

377
00:30:07,767 --> 00:30:11,237
(Posh accent) How do we know
you're not sent by him to nick the ring,

378
00:30:11,367 --> 00:30:13,756
when you've lulled us
with your filthy ways?

379
00:30:13,887 --> 00:30:17,357
- What filthy ways are these?
- You can put that away.

380
00:30:17,487 --> 00:30:21,605
Until this moment you were safe
because my sister was chosen

381

and no other could be sacrificed
to Kaili.

382

From this moment it is death to him
who wears the ring.

386
00:30:46,047 --> 00:30:48,515
This will make your finger shrink.
Be brave.

387
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:50,126
Don't look.

388
00:30:50,247 --> 00:30:53,398

this would not be necessary.

You've been up that temple again.

You're as bad as your sister, coming
home from work at all hours and colours.

There might be some insurance.

Find out.

What did you say that stuff is?

395
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:33,205
This will just make his finger shrink
a little. lt's a minor medical secret.

396
00:31:33,327 --> 00:31:35,682
l'm sure there's no call for all this.

397

- Gum?
- Are you sure it's not or habit forming?

399

No. As long as you don't swallow it.

400

Synchronise your watches.

the effect is purely transitory.

Now a turn to the right and it locks.

537

l am turning it to the right.
lt is locking.

538

That's what comes
of teaching science by TV.

539

Hey, it's a thingy.

l am very busy... please!

574
00:45:51,047 --> 00:45:53,038
Perhaps if we gave away free tickets

575
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:56,318
to the youth organisation
annual sacrifice,

576
00:45:56,447 --> 00:45:59,996

lt's a very real problem.

Red?

581
00:46:38,007 --> 00:46:40,680
They have to paint me red
before they chop me.

582
00:46:40,807 --> 00:46:43,446
lt's a different religion from ours...
l think

583
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:47,845
- So this is the famous ring, eh?
- l'm in fear of my life, you know.

584
00:46:47,967 --> 00:46:50,640
So this is the famous Beatles?

585
00:46:50,767 --> 00:46:52,723
So this is the famous Scotland Yard?

586
00:46:53,927 --> 00:46:55,918
How long do you think you'll last?

587
00:46:56,047 --> 00:46:59,801
You can't say fairer than that.
Great Train Robbery, how's that going?

588
00:46:59,927 --> 00:47:03,078
- You don't believe us, do you?
- (Phone rings)

589
00:47:04,167 --> 00:47:07,159
- Chief Superintendent.
- (Man) 'Ringo, please.'

590
00:47:07,287 --> 00:47:09,960
- lt's for you, the famous Ringo.
- lt's them.

591
00:47:10,087 --> 00:47:12,760
- Only me and Paul know we're here.
- l know.

592
00:47:12,887 --> 00:47:17,483
Allow me. l'm a bit of a famous mimic.
You know... James Cagney.

593
00:47:19,047 --> 00:47:22,164
(Liverpool accent)
Hello, this is the famous Ringo,

594
00:47:22,287 --> 00:47:24,960
what is it that l can do for you?

595
00:47:25,087 --> 00:47:26,759
Not a bit like Cagney.

596
00:47:26,887 --> 00:47:30,482
- (Clang) 'Go to the window.'
- Hey, it is them!

(Clang) 'Go to the window.'

598

Go to the window.

599
00:47:36,367 --> 00:47:39,120
Go to the window.

600
00:47:39,247 --> 00:47:41,886
Go to the window.

601

'Go to the window.'

602
00:47:56,287 --> 00:47:59,996
There's a strong case for arming
the police. We're not all masochists.

603
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:03,244
- Now see?
- l believe you. Thousands wouldn't.

604
00:48:03,367 --> 00:48:06,882
Right, let's get going.
Pass me the phone, will you?

605
00:48:07,007 --> 00:48:10,363
Lifeline of the service.
Dial 999.

606
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:13,604
We need protection.
We've got a record to do tomorrow.

607

Oh yes, you told me

621
00:49:12,087 --> 00:49:14,760
You don't want my loving anymore

622
00:49:17,047 --> 00:49:19,686

00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:48,085
Yes...

690
00:54:52,767 --> 00:54:55,281
When l held you near

691
00:54:55,407 --> 00:54:58,558
You were so sincere

692
00:54:58,687 --> 00:55:02,521
Treat me like you did
the night before

693
00:55:03,247 --> 00:55:05,886
Like the night before

694
00:55:11,407 --> 00:55:14,319
- Hey!
- We're being attacked!

695

(Gunfire )

696
00:55:26,247 --> 00:55:28,807
(Man yells) Retreat! Retreat!

697
00:55:31,687 --> 00:55:34,963
Come on! We're being fired at!
Get out of here!

698
00:55:38,247 --> 00:55:40,203
Come on! Retreat!

699
00:55:49,687 --> 00:55:51,484
Run!

700
00:55:54,607 --> 00:55:56,598
Quick! Faster!

701
00:55:57,647 --> 00:55:59,797
Hey, mind the tank!

702
00:56:06,647 --> 00:56:08,444
Get up, Johnny!

703
00:56:08,567 --> 00:56:12,196
- Stop!
- Johnny! Walk for me. You can do it!

704
00:56:13,087 --> 00:56:15,999
ln here! Quickly! Quick!

705
00:56:36,287 --> 00:56:38,562

Fire!

708
00:56:54,567 --> 00:56:58,799
- Left! Steady on. 1 -500.
- 1 -500.

709
00:56:58,927 --> 00:57:01,566
l regret losing a lieutenant
as able as Ahme

710
00:57:01,687 --> 00:57:03,962
but she was told the price of capture.

711
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:07,284
- Enemy tank moving from left to right.
- Loaded.

712
00:57:07,407 --> 00:57:11,082
- Well, fire the nasty thing.
- Firing now, <i>Saheb.</i>

713
00:57:15,287 --> 00:57:17,278
Missed! You naughty boys.

714
00:57:23,287 --> 00:57:26,199
Turn us right.

715
00:57:31,087 --> 00:57:32,725

716
00:57:38,887 --> 00:57:40,878

717
00:57:45,567 --> 00:57:47,876
(Cheering)

718
00:58:27,647 --> 00:58:32,243
There must be somewhere in England
where one can find sanctuary to think.

719
00:58:36,127 --> 00:58:39,278
How's your equilibrium, Ringo?

720
00:58:39,407 --> 00:58:42,160
How's yours?
You're light again, George.

721
00:58:42,287 --> 00:58:45,518
- How do you know it's not you.
- Cos l never am, am l Paul?

722
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,956
Here, cop this, one hand!

723
00:58:49,087 --> 00:58:51,043
- (John) Ugly, though.
- The hands?

724
00:58:52,167 --> 00:58:56,877
- Some people's are.
- Show us your hand, Ringo.

725
00:58:58,647 --> 00:59:00,797
- You want to chuck one in?
- Get on!

726
00:59:00,927 --> 00:59:04,363
- How about drumming, though?
- lt won't affect it.

727
00:59:04,487 --> 00:59:07,524
l don't know many...

728
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:10,957
lt appears l need one card.
l'm chucking one in.

729
00:59:11,087 --> 00:59:12,759
Very light-hearted.

730
00:59:12,887 --> 00:59:15,526
- Discarding it.
- Like an old boot.

731
00:59:15,647 --> 00:59:18,366
They're talking about your finger,
you know.

732
00:59:18,487 --> 00:59:21,445
One card. Dealer takes one.

733
00:59:21,567 --> 00:59:23,364
See, that didn't hurt.

734
00:59:23,487 --> 00:59:27,366
- Will you hold this drumstick?
- Manchester has a good drummer.

735
00:59:27,487 --> 00:59:29,762
Well, l don't just drum with it, do l?

736
00:59:29,887 --> 00:59:31,878
- What else then?
- l use it, you know.

737
00:59:32,367 --> 00:59:35,006
Quite a good-looking fellow, too.
l'll raise you.

738
00:59:36,047 --> 00:59:39,562
You haven't used that finger
in the past hour and we're in danger.

739
00:59:39,687 --> 00:59:42,884
Me and Paul haven't seen you
use of that finger, have we?

740
00:59:43,007 --> 00:59:45,282
- No.
- And again.

741
00:59:45,407 --> 00:59:49,286
We're risking our lives to preserve
a useless member.

742
00:59:49,847 --> 00:59:51,644
That bloke with Scott,

743
00:59:51,767 --> 00:59:55,237
l've always admired the way he went
into the snow for his mates.

744
00:59:55,367 --> 00:59:58,165
- And again.
- You're joking!

745
01:00:00,287 --> 01:00:03,484
Just hold this drumstick.

746
01:00:11,767 --> 01:00:14,759
You've raised it a little bundle
on the quiet.

747
01:00:14,887 --> 01:00:17,720
- lt's like having a tooth out.
- l've got a good hand.

748
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:20,839
You only lay out money
is when you've got five aces.

749
01:00:20,967 --> 01:00:23,640
- Do you want to see me?
- You're joking... take it.

750
01:00:23,767 --> 01:00:25,962
l will see... l've won it.

751
01:00:26,087 --> 01:00:27,805
- Cut.
- No!

752
01:00:29,887 --> 01:00:32,355
l think tea, don't you? Tea.

753
01:00:32,487 --> 01:00:35,365
They expect me to cut my finger off.

754
01:00:35,487 --> 01:00:36,966
The famous finger, eh?

755
01:00:37,087 --> 01:00:40,363
So the police are extended
giving the famous protection,

756
01:00:40,487 --> 01:00:43,877
for which we are justly proud
in this country, for a finger, eh?

757
01:00:45,887 --> 01:00:48,481
What's that... lt's haunted, you know.

758
01:00:48,607 --> 01:00:52,759
- Are you going to cut?
- No, l'm not and let that be an end to it.

759
01:00:52,887 --> 01:00:55,003
End to it!

760
01:00:55,127 --> 01:00:57,436
This wing of the palace is haunted.

761
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:15,237
We won't leave this palace alive.

762
01:01:15,367 --> 01:01:18,757
The Queen will have something
to say about that.

763
01:01:18,887 --> 01:01:21,003
- What's that?
- l beg your pardon?

764
01:01:21,127 --> 01:01:24,961
- That thing coming through his stomach.
- l daren't look!

765
01:01:31,367 --> 01:01:33,403
lt's only a hose.

766
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:39,602
(Whistle blows softly)

767
01:01:39,727 --> 01:01:43,402
- lt's for you.
- lt's the gardener.

768
01:01:49,167 --> 01:01:51,397
l'll stick it out the window.

769
01:01:53,607 --> 01:01:56,280
(Marching feet)

770
01:01:57,287 --> 01:01:59,005
(Man) Eyes left.

771
01:02:02,487 --> 01:02:04,762
(Gas hisses)

772
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:06,878
(Man) Eyes front!

773
01:02:11,207 --> 01:02:12,879
Must be their tea break.

774
01:02:15,207 --> 01:02:17,516
Hands up!

775
01:02:17,647 --> 01:02:19,763
Hands up! Quick!

776
01:02:19,887 --> 01:02:22,640
Come on, lets have you.

777
01:02:22,767 --> 01:02:25,076
Steady!

778
01:02:27,767 --> 01:02:30,759
There goes my knighthood.
You, left hand...

779
01:02:32,967 --> 01:02:35,117
Lets have that ring.

780

(Gunshots)

781
01:02:52,887 --> 01:02:54,878
lt's me, you fool.

782
01:02:57,367 --> 01:03:00,882
- Quick! Quick!
- Let's catch him!

783
01:03:01,007 --> 01:03:03,601
This should work,
it's from Harvard.

784
01:03:04,407 --> 01:03:08,559
- lt looks like a laser.
- lt's a relativity cadenza.

785
01:03:08,687 --> 01:03:10,757
That should slow them down a bit.

786
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:13,560
There, point it down the hall.
Quickly!

787
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:18,955
Hurry up with the plug,
l'll align the sights... Yes!

788
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:20,884
Right, good.

789

790

- Bad machine!

- Well, you didn't miss your tonsils.
- How do you know?

810
01:05:10,487 --> 01:05:12,205
Why don't you chop it off, Ringo?

811
01:05:12,327 --> 01:05:15,603
Look John, l've had some great times
with this finger.

812

You can have a fire and theft policy.
Five quid a week.

815
01:05:23,567 --> 01:05:26,764

- So it is!
- Don't worry, he's harmless.

838

All you have to do is sing Beethoven's
Ode to Joy from the 9th symphony.

- PC 4 7...
- Uh-huh.

861
01:10:56,407 --> 01:10:59,160
- PC 6 of 3...
- Oh.

862
01:10:59,287 --> 01:11:00,766
- PC 9...
- Hmm.

863
01:11:00,887 --> 01:11:03,606
- PC 85...
- Mmm.

864
01:11:03,727 --> 01:11:05,763
- PC 4...
- Yes.

865
01:11:05,887 --> 01:11:08,959
PC 21 , PC 85...

866
01:11:14,047 --> 01:11:17,357
You should have thought of that
before you left the house.

867
01:11:17,487 --> 01:11:20,320
Left... To shore...
Port, starboard!

868
01:11:21,007 --> 01:11:25,762
For l have got another girl

869
01:11:25,887 --> 01:11:27,366
Another girl

870
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:31,560
You're making me say
that l've got nobody but you

871
01:11:32,687 --> 01:11:37,966
But as from today,
well l've got somebody that's new

872
01:11:38,087 --> 01:11:42,160
l ain't no fool and l don't take
what l don't want

873
01:11:42,287 --> 01:11:47,520
For l have got another girl

874
01:11:47,647 --> 01:11:49,126
Another girl

875
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:54,275
She's sweeter than all the girls
and l met quite a few

876
01:11:54,407 --> 01:11:59,845
Nobody in all the world can do
what she can do

877
01:11:59,967 --> 01:12:04,006
And so l'm telling you
this time you'd better stop

878
01:12:04,127 --> 01:12:09,360
For l have got another girl

879
01:12:09,487 --> 01:12:14,686
Another girl who will love me
till the end

880
01:12:14,807 --> 01:12:20,120
Through thick and thin
she will always be my friend

881
01:12:21,807 --> 01:12:27,325
l don't wanna say
that l've been unhappy with you

882
01:12:27,447 --> 01:12:32,396
But as from today,
well l've seen somebody that's new

883
01:12:32,527 --> 01:12:37,078
l ain't no fool and l don't take
what l don't want

884
01:12:37,207 --> 01:12:42,600
For l have got another girl

885
01:12:42,727 --> 01:12:48,120
Another girl who will love me
till the end

886
01:12:48,247 --> 01:12:53,958
Through thick and thin
she will always be my friend

887
01:12:55,087 --> 01:13:00,559
l don't wanna say
that l've been unhappy with you

888
01:13:00,687 --> 01:13:05,966
But as from today,
well l've seen somebody that's new

889
01:13:06,087 --> 01:13:10,524
l ain't no fool and l don't take
what l don't want

890
01:13:10,647 --> 01:13:16,358
For l have got another girl

891
01:13:16,487 --> 01:13:20,526
Another girl, another girl

892
01:13:25,767 --> 01:13:28,076
- Let's play a game, eh? Beep-beeps.
- OK.

893
01:13:32,847 --> 01:13:34,838
Beep-beep, beep-beep!

894
01:13:36,447 --> 01:13:38,563
(Hollering)

895
01:13:38,687 --> 01:13:40,359
Oh, oh, oh!

896
01:13:44,047 --> 01:13:46,800
Radar's broken! Never mind.

897
01:13:48,487 --> 01:13:51,763
(Hollers) Beatles! Hello!

898
01:13:51,887 --> 01:13:53,764
Port... Starboard... Over there!

899
01:13:53,887 --> 01:13:56,401
Oh, oh, oh!

900
01:13:58,167 --> 01:14:01,603
Ah! A-ha, a-ha, a-ha!

901
01:14:05,647 --> 01:14:07,638
Open that rock!

902
01:14:09,487 --> 01:14:11,125
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

903
01:14:11,247 --> 01:14:13,966
- ls that it?
- Better watch your fingers, Ringo!

904
01:14:14,087 --> 01:14:17,557
Clang had the whole temple transported
here for your sacrifice.

905
01:14:17,687 --> 01:14:20,406
He needn't have bothered.
Very nice of him, though.

906
01:14:20,527 --> 01:14:23,963
- What's this?
- This is where you'll be disembowelled.

907
01:14:24,087 --> 01:14:26,555
You don't go for all that,
do you?

908
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:28,723
Keeps you busy, eh?

909
01:14:28,847 --> 01:14:32,920
- Do you know where Clang is?
- l'm his mother and he's a good boy.

910
01:14:33,047 --> 01:14:34,366
(Hollering)

911
01:14:34,487 --> 01:14:37,047
l don't want to knock
anyone's religion, but...

912
01:14:37,167 --> 01:14:40,318
- ln here, quick.
- (Ringo ) l can't swim.

913
01:14:42,367 --> 01:14:44,483
l'm not going!

914
01:14:50,727 --> 01:14:52,285
Where have they gone?

915
01:15:11,247 --> 01:15:13,363
- Let's go back and get them!
- l'm game.

916
01:15:13,487 --> 01:15:16,957
- Let's smash them!
- Let's find that temple.

917
01:15:17,087 --> 01:15:20,921
- A man's got to do what he's got to do.
- l don't like running away.

918
01:15:21,047 --> 01:15:24,119
- Let's go back and get them.
- They'll disembowel us.

919
01:15:24,247 --> 01:15:27,762
- Not if l get the boot in first.
- Let's go back and get them.

920
01:15:27,887 --> 01:15:33,007
They won't disembowel us, you see.
That's all gab - disembowelling...

921
01:15:47,527 --> 01:15:50,325
- Signpost.
- Signpost.

922
01:15:50,447 --> 01:15:52,483
- Guide book.
- Guide book.

923
01:15:52,607 --> 01:15:55,280
- Feet.
- Feet? Oh, feet!

924
01:15:56,887 --> 01:15:58,366
Red light.

925
01:15:58,487 --> 01:16:00,796
Kaili!

926
01:16:00,927 --> 01:16:03,885
- Green light, go!
- (Yells) Kaili!

927
01:16:12,887 --> 01:16:16,197
The things we have to do
in these heathen countries.

928
01:16:16,327 --> 01:16:19,364
There must be an easier way
to set a trap!

929
01:16:30,407 --> 01:16:34,719
- Easterner speaks with forked tongue.
- What does he say?

930
01:16:34,847 --> 01:16:38,283
Passing this way with hot foot
to the temple.

931
01:16:38,407 --> 01:16:41,285
Don't encourage him!
You've got the part, Paul.

932
01:16:41,407 --> 01:16:45,366
- Dare we ask how you know?
- How! l saw those footprints...

933
01:16:45,487 --> 01:16:47,921
And this guidebook.

934
01:16:48,047 --> 01:16:50,436
- To the temple.
- (Whistles)

935
01:17:03,887 --> 01:17:06,401
After them...slowly!

936
01:17:22,207 --> 01:17:26,439
- That's not it, is it?
- lt's on the map as being here.

937
01:17:26,567 --> 01:17:31,163
That temple under the rock,
that swimming pool that we came up in...

938
01:17:31,287 --> 01:17:34,916
- l'm lost!
- This isn't a temple, is it?

939
01:17:35,047 --> 01:17:39,120
- So this is a famous temple?
- Should be. lt's gone.

940
01:17:39,247 --> 01:17:42,000
l hope that disembowelling thingy
has gone, too.

941
01:17:42,127 --> 01:17:44,687
- Was there ever a temple here?
- Never, sir.

942
01:17:44,807 --> 01:17:49,722
Old army place. Well-known
place of retreat for courting couples

943
01:17:49,847 --> 01:17:52,315
who like the echoes of bugles
as they court.

944
01:17:52,447 --> 01:17:54,961
That's my theory.

945
01:17:55,087 --> 01:17:56,759
Ugh!

946
01:17:56,887 --> 01:17:59,321
- Aren't we going in?
- No, let's not.

947
01:17:59,447 --> 01:18:02,166
Oh, come on lads,
where's that famous pluck?

948
01:18:02,287 --> 01:18:04,926
- l haven't got any. Have you, George?
- Did have.

949
01:18:05,047 --> 01:18:06,685
- l have had.
- l will have.

950
01:18:08,607 --> 01:18:11,201
He's a bit soft that lnspector,
isn't he?

951
01:18:11,327 --> 01:18:13,363
He never takes his hat off.

952
01:18:13,487 --> 01:18:15,955
lt's very hot over here
for wearing a hat.

953
01:18:31,287 --> 01:18:33,198
- l'm off.
- Typical!

954
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:38,164
(Yells) Kaili!

955
01:18:38,287 --> 01:18:40,118
Argh!

956
01:18:40,247 --> 01:18:42,283
- Kaili!
- Kaili!

957
01:18:44,847 --> 01:18:46,644
(Electric buzz)

958
01:18:46,767 --> 01:18:51,204
The fiends! They've electrified
the wire with high tension. HT.

959
01:18:51,327 --> 01:18:52,965
The fiends!

960
01:19:06,887 --> 01:19:09,082
(Hollers) Help me!

961
01:19:09,207 --> 01:19:10,526
Help!

962
01:19:10,647 --> 01:19:12,365
He's mine!

963
01:19:13,087 --> 01:19:14,486
Help!

964
01:19:16,087 --> 01:19:17,566
Help me!

965
01:19:43,407 --> 01:19:46,240
There's one on the back,
but it's not the right one.

966
01:19:49,167 --> 01:19:52,921
Come here, boy! Let me explain.

967
01:19:54,927 --> 01:19:57,999
This is no time for foolish tricks!
This is a hired car.

968
01:20:01,287 --> 01:20:03,562
Back up and smash him off.

969
01:20:03,687 --> 01:20:06,360
(Algernon) Now, this will get him!

970
01:20:08,127 --> 01:20:11,119
Oh! Never mind. Try again.

971
01:20:12,527 --> 01:20:14,404
This should give him a headache.

972
01:20:17,647 --> 01:20:19,638
Where's he gone?

973
01:20:21,007 --> 01:20:24,204
- That's done it, he's gone.
- l can't start the car.

974
01:20:24,327 --> 01:20:26,761
- (Engine splutters)
- Hello.

975
01:20:26,887 --> 01:20:29,640
Oh, hello! Hang on a minute...

976
01:20:31,887 --> 01:20:33,081
On, on!

977
01:20:37,007 --> 01:20:39,237
l seem to be having
a slight difficulty.

978
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:42,279
To the right! oh...

979
01:20:51,647 --> 01:20:53,842
- l think it might be the wrong key.
- On!

980
01:20:56,967 --> 01:20:58,719
On!

981
01:21:00,127 --> 01:21:02,641
(Engine starts)

982
01:21:05,047 --> 01:21:07,515
(Algernon) Got it.
Didn't take long, did it?

983
01:21:20,807 --> 01:21:22,798
Thanks for the lift, sailor!

984
01:21:29,287 --> 01:21:31,847
- Where did the thugs go?
- They've vanished.

985
01:21:31,967 --> 01:21:34,083
- He's got a plan.
- A very famous plan.

986
01:21:34,207 --> 01:21:36,163
Superintendent, you've got a plan.

987
01:21:36,287 --> 01:21:38,198
- Yes...
- Superintendent.

988
01:21:38,327 --> 01:21:39,646
l've got a plan.

989
01:23:21,927 --> 01:23:23,997
(Hollers) Ringo!

990
01:23:24,127 --> 01:23:25,685
Ringo!

991
01:23:25,807 --> 01:23:28,560
- Ringo!
- Ringo!

992
01:23:28,687 --> 01:23:31,406
- Ringo!
- Ringo!

993
01:23:31,527 --> 01:23:33,006
Ringo!

994
01:23:33,127 --> 01:23:35,163
(Dogs bark)

995
01:23:35,287 --> 01:23:36,845
Ringo!

996
01:23:46,647 --> 01:23:48,205
All right, talk!

997
01:23:48,327 --> 01:23:51,239
We know he's a prisoner,
but where?

998
01:23:55,887 --> 01:23:58,355
- l'm a perfect surgeon.
- Huh?

999
01:23:58,487 --> 01:24:01,126
- l'm a perfect surgeon.
- He was asked to take it up.

1000
01:24:01,247 --> 01:24:04,045
Alas... Scalpel.

1001
01:24:04,167 --> 01:24:05,680
Sca...

1002
01:24:13,207 --> 01:24:15,801
Sand in the generator.

1003
01:24:15,927 --> 01:24:19,397
lt gets everywhere. No wonder
l never get anything done.

1004
01:24:19,527 --> 01:24:21,677
Fix it, Algernon.

1005
01:24:22,487 --> 01:24:25,240
You wouldn't want me to go in
with a blunt scalpel.

1006
01:24:25,367 --> 01:24:26,686
Fix it!

1007
01:24:26,807 --> 01:24:30,800
l'm a decent employer,
but he takes advantage of me.

1008
01:24:30,927 --> 01:24:34,078
- lt's the heat, it makes him stroppy.
- Luckily.

1009
01:24:38,487 --> 01:24:40,000
l've got some juice.

1010
01:24:41,087 --> 01:24:45,080
(Ringo ) l can't understand it. They kept
pulling my nose. Mine of all noses!

1011
01:24:45,207 --> 01:24:49,405
- What's that?
- Distilled from the essence of orchids.

1012
01:24:49,527 --> 01:24:50,880
Hands up!

1013
01:24:52,807 --> 01:24:55,446
- What's that?
- Distilled from the essence...

1014
01:24:55,567 --> 01:25:00,163
Not distilled from the essence of orchids
found only in certain recesses?

1015
01:25:00,287 --> 01:25:05,566
At last! l'll have my just reward.
Give it to me! Sir Tiberius Foot Juice!

1016
01:25:05,687 --> 01:25:08,724
- But the ring...
- Who needs it now that l have this.

1017
01:25:08,847 --> 01:25:11,486
- Do you know what this is?
- A Webley automatic...

1018
01:25:11,607 --> 01:25:15,919
lt's Nobel Prize juice. Set sail for home,
for England! A jewel set in the sea!

1019
01:25:16,047 --> 01:25:18,766
The government in the palm of my hand.
What's it say?

1020
01:25:18,887 --> 01:25:21,162
- You're going on a sea voyage...
- No, this!

1021
01:25:21,287 --> 01:25:24,563
- (Algernon) l don't know.
- Haven't you a degree in Eastern?

1022
01:25:24,687 --> 01:25:27,804
- (Algernon) l don't think so.
- Let's get it translated.

1023
01:25:27,927 --> 01:25:29,599
- Now!
- Right!

1024
01:25:34,007 --> 01:25:37,079
- l can't swim.
- What do you mean you can't swim?

1025
01:25:43,807 --> 01:25:46,241
(Clang) Treacherous Woman,
tremble...

1026
01:25:47,127 --> 01:25:50,164
ln the name of Preverti,
