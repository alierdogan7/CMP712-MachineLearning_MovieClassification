15 men went ashore that day,

42
00:03:58,587 --> 00:04:02,296
and only Flint, his own self, returned.

43
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:06,434
Oh, aye,
and then old Flinty up and died

44
00:04:06,495 --> 00:04:12,070
Afore they could get back to that
cursed island and dig up the treasure.

45
00:04:12,134 --> 00:04:17,049
No one knows to this day
who has old Flint's map.

46
00:04:17,105 --> 00:04:20,951

worth the hearing?

47
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:23,546
It was the first dozen times.

48
00:04:23,612 --> 00:04:26,058
I'll drink to that.

49
00:04:26,114 --> 00:04:33,259
But who has the map now, huh? Some
black-hearted, squid-sucking buccaneer?

50
00:04:33,321 --> 00:04:37,133
Or maybe it's our very own Jim Hawkins.

51
00:04:37,192 --> 00:04:38,933
Eh, Jimmy?

52
00:04:38,994 --> 00:04:42,237
If I had it,
my friends and I wouldn't be here.

53
00:04:42,297 --> 00:04:45,397
We'd be searching for
that treasure, sailing

54
00:04:45,412 --> 00:04:48,111
the seven seas on a
five-year mission,

55
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:52,744
boldly going where no man
has gone before. That's catchy.

56
00:04:52,808 --> 00:04:57,917
Not me. If I had that treasure map,
I'd trade it for a decent meal.

57
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,253
Think he'll eat this?

58
00:05:00,315 --> 00:05:05,060
Aye! Beware the one-legged man.
He's the one to fear.

59

We'll watch for him.
Yeah.

60
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:11,030
I'll watch for him,
if he's delivering a pizza.

61
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:13,266
Even old Flinty feared him.

62
00:05:13,328 --> 00:05:18,641
If he comes round here, run for me quick.
If we see him we'll tell you.

Oh, yes. And, boys...

83
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:25,805
last night you forgot
to put out the lantern.

84
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:30,441
Forget again and there'll be
no table scraps for a week.

I hate your life too.
If I had a life, I'd hate it.

89
00:06:44,553 --> 00:06:46,863
I should run off to sea
like my father.

90

He was my age when he sailed to China.
He wound up a first mate.

Off to Zanzibar
to meet the Zanzibarbarians.

104
00:07:34,502 --> 00:07:37,608
Here they go again.
To the southwest, pirate galleons.

(THEY LAUGH)

343
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,413
Mr. Bimbo, the ship is provisioned,
the crew is in place,

344
00:22:43,477 --> 00:22:48,551
and the captain should be on board
within the hour. You have been busy.

345
00:22:48,616 --> 00:22:49,959
Yuch!

346
00:22:50,017 --> 00:22:53,021
Look there goes Jim.
Yeah.

347
00:22:53,954 --> 00:22:57,060
Look it's the boat-steering thing.

348
00:22:57,124 --> 00:22:59,161
This is called the helm.

349
00:22:59,226 --> 00:23:03,675
Hey, how does it feel,
Captain Hawkins?

350
00:23:03,731 --> 00:23:09,147
It feels like we're really doing it.
Like we're finally having an adventure.

351
00:23:09,203 --> 00:23:12,184
I'm starving.
Where's the kitchen?

352
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:13,411

I'm afraid we shish-kebab

Yeah.

Hungry, lads? In my galley
you're always welcome to help yourselves.

How about you?

00:24:13,968 --> 00:24:16,175
Huh?
Here.

You must be Master Hawkins.
Yes, sir.

375
00:24:28,582 --> 00:24:32,189
You needn't call
a lowly ship's cook "sir."

376
00:24:32,253 --> 00:24:36,292
Long John Silver,
at your humble service.

377
00:24:36,357 --> 00:24:38,997
We're just cabin boys, Mr. Silver.

378
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:43,303
Long John to his friends.

379
00:24:43,364 --> 00:24:49,645
And believe me, a friend you can trust
is worth his weight in gold.

380
00:24:49,703 --> 00:24:54,652
There's many a dark-hearted scoundrel
in these ports.

What do you mean? Pirates?
Shh!

382
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:02,057
Pirates? That's rich.
What an imagination. Give me a cracker.

383
00:25:02,116 --> 00:25:05,359
Allow me to introduce
my pet lobster, Polly.

Pieces of eight!
(SQUAWKS)

385
00:25:07,888 --> 00:25:13,304
I raised him from a fingerling. As fine
a crustacean as a man could ask for.

386
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,534
I thought sailors
had talking parrots.

387
00:25:16,597 --> 00:25:18,873
Talking parrots?

388
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:23,382
What an imagination.
First pirates, now talking parrots.

389
00:25:23,437 --> 00:25:27,544
What's next? A singing, dancing mouse
with his own amusement park?

390
00:25:27,608 --> 00:25:29,747
That's enough, Polly.
Shoo!

Lost that timber fighting brigands
off Madagascar under Admiral Hawke.

There's many a man lost a leg and worse
in the service of the king.

Why, look what a cannibal took off me

Move aside. Make ready for the captain!
Lallygaggers will suffer his wrath.

Is this captain bad-tempered?
ls he bad-tempered?

by inner demons mortals cannot fathom.

You there.
Me?

You were in charge of railing dust.
30 lashes, then walk the plank.

I didn't say that.
I was anticipating your whim.

00:28:36,697 --> 00:28:38,608
Hm.

427

You must be the cabin boys.
Yes, sir.

Which one of you is Hawkins?
I am.

429
00:28:45,005 --> 00:28:47,952
I knew your father.
He was a good man.

Gonzo, he seems all right.

436
00:29:07,461 --> 00:29:10,772
Long John's only a cook.
How dangerous could he be?

I don't know, but I...
Where's Rizzo?

What?

Hard to starboard.
Any man caught dawdling will be shot.

I didn't say that.
I was paraphrasing.

No, that's silly.

hired the crew. Mr. Bimbo.

Very true.
We must set an example for this crew.

Even in the China Sea, that's north.

It were a terrible shame.
