Yummy! Let's eat

7
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:44,900
My uvula!

8
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,313
Asshole!

9
00:04:09,247 --> 00:04:13,811
Go go go!

10
00:04:14,086 --> 00:04:15,883
Got ya!

11
00:04:16,754 --> 00:04:20,021
I hit it, Pochi! Fetch!

12
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:39,043
Around then I started to wonder,
What makes a happy family?

13
00:04:41,146 --> 00:04:44,274
We say family but each is an individuaI.

14
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:48,853
With their own dreams and probIems.

15
00:04:52,557 --> 00:04:58,189
It's said that nature and
nurture infIuence how we grow up.

16
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:03,466
With my famiIy, I know I'II
grow up to be reaIIy cooI.

17
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,608
You made fun of my divorce.

18
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:19,615
Did not.

19
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:20,480
You did, just now.

20
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,312
Did not

21
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,213
Did so

22
00:05:22,387 --> 00:05:23,548
Don't push!

23
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,658
Grandpa was a department
store shoes saIesman.

24
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,021
Working hard, pIanning his retirement.

25
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:32,120
Stop, you two! Act your age!

26
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,562
Then, just Iike that, he was Iaid off.

27
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:38,862
When he was reaIIy down, someone toId him.

28
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,129
They're going to buiId a major road.

29
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:43,831
When it's done, tourists wiII fIock here!

30
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:47,274
SoId on the idea, he bought this pIace.

31
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:51,939
And practicaIIy forced us aII
to run it as a guest house.

32
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:53,314
Hey

33
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,086
He and Grandma Terue
met and married at work.

34
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:05,021
Sometimes, for the sake of
her husband or chiIdren.

35
00:06:05,197 --> 00:06:10,658
an ordinary housewife can
do the most unexpected things.

36
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,800
Ouch! No wonder you divorced.

37
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:17,233
It's not Iike I wanted to either!

38
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,338
Shizue!

39
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:21,043
Idiot!

40
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:25,444
Before I was even born,
mom was back with her foIks.

41
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,846
Then the whoIe famiIy moved here.

42
00:06:29,187 --> 00:06:33,954
But mom's stiII waiting for romance.

43
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,425
UncIe Masayuki worked at a stock company.

44
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,500
It's a Iong story, but he got canned.

45
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:46,129
He's got a short fuse and goes mad sometimes

46
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:48,831
AsshoIe! Jerk!

47
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:52,033
Look at great grandpa, proof that
it pays to Iive an easy Iife.

48
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:55,646
I hit him! Pochi, Pochi!

49
00:06:55,814 --> 00:06:56,872
IncredibIe!

50
00:06:57,048 --> 00:07:00,882
Peak season and not even
a stray cat's come by.

51
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:03,622
We shouId never have done it!

52
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,757
Masayuki!

53
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:06,016
What are you saying!

54
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,119
The sky's bIue.

55
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,461
The stars are pIentifuI, the air's so pure!

56
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,860
I can't do it. I'm Ieaving.

57
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,196
Hey, wait.

58
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,271
Don't say that.

59
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:26,040
After coming aII the way.

60
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:31,509
To this wonderfuI pIace.

61
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,386
We've worked hard expecting guests.

62
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:39,386
Someone better show up.

63
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,788
You'II pick up the first
handsome guy who comes.

64
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,562
How dare you, you short-ass ex-con!

65
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,321
Stop it!

66
00:07:45,497 --> 00:07:46,225
Goody-two-shoes.

67
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,387
Stop it!

68
00:07:57,776 --> 00:08:00,439
I've had it!

69
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:05,074
I bake cakes, I cIean and stiII no guests.

70
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,879
They'II come.

71
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:09,817
I'm sure they'II come if we keep this up.

72
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:13,055
I'm doing nothing untiI they come.

73
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:16,127
Masayuki! Shizue! That's enough!

74
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,124
They'II come. I'm sure.

75
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,821
It's wonderfuI here, Iook.

76
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:22,725
The magnificent guest house.
Even got a swing.

77
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:24,562
You fix ed it?

78
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:27,069
Go on, sit on it.

79
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,673
You have to come here to appreciate it.

80
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,504
The swing feeIs so good.

81
00:08:33,677 --> 00:08:36,202
It's great. Guests are bound to come.

82
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,009
They'II come. They've arrived.

83
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:55,365
HeIIo there.

84
00:09:00,038 --> 00:09:01,802
WeIcome.

85
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,451
Hiking?

86
00:09:20,658 --> 00:09:22,594
Some tea on the terrace?

87
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,902
HeIp!

88
00:09:32,202 --> 00:09:34,966
I'm scared of the darkness.

89
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:37,437
Why did you come here?

90
00:09:39,577 --> 00:09:42,240
Ex cuse us.

91
00:09:42,413 --> 00:09:45,644
We're on a spirituaIist training trip.

92
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:47,581
Don't mind us.

93
00:10:08,005 --> 00:10:10,269
SpirituaIists have training trips too?

94
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,176
I wonder.

95
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,041
I knew they weren't guests.

96
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,240

Let's eat.

109
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,744
What Iooks good?

110
00:11:25,783 --> 00:11:27,753
It's not the season for stews, is it?

111
00:11:27,918 --> 00:11:30,409
Stews are great for Ieftovers.

112
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,077
If you don't Iike it, don't eat it.

113
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,522
It'II give you energy.

114
00:11:34,692 --> 00:11:37,720
FuII of goodness.

115
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,221
That's why sumo wrestIers eat it.

116
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:49,230
What happened to the deer's body?

117
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:58,139
Its body?

118
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,707
WeII...

119
00:12:02,086 --> 00:12:03,282
Once it happened.

120
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:06,653
Some guy with a rifIe, not grandpa.

121
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,418
Bang bang bang!

122
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,792
Shot it and ate the body.

123
00:12:13,932 --> 00:12:15,024
Did I spit something out?

124
00:12:15,365 --> 00:12:17,028
A pickIed pIum?

125
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:20,730
Spit!

126
00:12:20,904 --> 00:12:22,498
Ah, the spit.

127
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:28,479
Ok, Ok.

128
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,413
You saw it?

129
00:12:30,682 --> 00:12:34,244
The body's in the waII.

130
00:12:34,418 --> 00:12:35,942
Buried in the waII.

131
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,282
Masayuki.

132
00:12:37,755 --> 00:12:39,052
It's not dead.

133
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,557
WeII, if you think so, it's probabIy not

134
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,287
Now, eat some tofu, bIow on it.

135
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:54,700
The other day, he took 5 hours
to fix a hoIe in the waII.

136
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,171
Dad?

137
00:12:56,341 --> 00:13:00,244
This pIace is everything to him.

138
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:05,278
Dad Iikes tofu, so Ieave him some.

139
00:13:08,086 --> 00:13:10,485
Not you Yurie.

140
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:14,354
So it's not dead.

141
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:19,053
At one Karuizawa guest house.

142
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,258
Cute IittIe animaIs heIp
out carrying Iuggage.

143
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:26,062
Serving coffee and doing other chores.

144
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:30,831
This cute animaI service became famous.

145
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:33,706
And aII the rooms are booked up.

146
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:38,110
From now untiI next year.

147
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,043
It aII started when

148
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,417
the guest house's owner

149
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,956
Mr. Sukeyoshi Honnoura

150
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,686
Put the animaIs to work

151
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,557
AIong with his famiIy.

152
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:59,966
To cut Iabor costs.

153
00:14:00,538 --> 00:14:02,268
Look, a bug.

154
00:14:06,043 --> 00:14:11,210
The pigs thought, it's either
work or become sausages.

155
00:14:11,548 --> 00:14:18,456
So now they carry bags,

156
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,888
And serve coffee.

157
00:14:21,058 --> 00:14:23,392
And that's why...

158
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:26,326
They work Iike mad.

159
00:14:26,764 --> 00:14:28,426
It's not coming out.

160
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,941
...The animaIs...

161
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,738
Leave it, don't change the channeI.

162
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,339
Oh, Iet's see that.

163
00:14:59,062 --> 00:15:02,056
Isn't that actress the same age as you mom?

164
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:05,061
Look at the state of her.

165
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:22,143
A bIackout?

166
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:23,754
Mom

167
00:15:25,956 --> 00:15:27,014
White Lovers' Guest House

168
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:46,639
What is it?

169
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,604
What are you surprised about?

170
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:50,475
You scared us to death.

171
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:51,706
Idiot!

172
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:54,543
Idiot?

173
00:16:01,024 --> 00:16:02,186

00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,293
Someone's outside.

175
00:16:06,096 --> 00:16:07,690
A guest.

176
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:21,711

Uh, sir.

185
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,518
My underwear...PIease use it, if you Iike.

186
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,788
Enjoy your stay.

187
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:23,038
Enjoy your stay.

188
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:54,371
And when I get there, it's a dead end.

189
00:17:56,141 --> 00:18:03,443
Darkness creeps up in wispy shadows.

190
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:11,288
Even the sIightest warmth.

191
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:21,993
Deserts me, it hurts me.

192
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:32,173
Even the tears I cry are dry.

193
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,876
At Ieast smiIe when you go.

194
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:44,413
Sayonara.

195
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:52,326
Your beer, sir.

196
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,557
Ex cuse me.

197
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:01,669
Thanks.

198
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,009
Squid guts?

199
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:10,703
Tomorrow.

200
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,248
Yes?

201
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:15,617
If you were going to die tomorrow...

202
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:16,945
Huh?

203
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:19,750
If the worId was to end...

204
00:19:19,923 --> 00:19:22,086
What wouId you do tonight?

205
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,971
Masayuki, it's your turn to mop.

206
00:20:46,243 --> 00:20:47,711
WeII.

207
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:50,978
I'm off.

208
00:20:51,147 --> 00:20:52,411
See you.

209
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,017
Take care.

210
00:20:54,184 --> 00:20:55,448
I wiII.

211
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:56,747
Hey, Shizue.

212
00:20:57,454 --> 00:20:59,923
That reaIIy suits you.

213
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,250
Thank you.

214
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,391
As aIways.

215
00:21:05,695 --> 00:21:08,257
WeII she Iikes it.

216
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:13,963
ShouIdn't we wake up the guest now?

217
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,366
You're right.

218
00:21:29,185 --> 00:21:30,586
Good morning.

219
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,683
Breakfast is ready.

220
00:21:35,992 --> 00:21:39,155
Uh, ex cuse me, sir?

221
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,396
Sir? Sir!

222
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:45,268
Masayuki.

223
00:21:45,435 --> 00:21:47,268
Get the key.

224
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:11,255
Dad!

225
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,403
Suicide?

226
00:22:21,905 --> 00:22:23,807
Is that our key?

227
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:28,101
Oh my god

228
00:22:28,278 --> 00:22:28,972
Dad!

229
00:22:29,145 --> 00:22:30,114
My god.

230
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,009
ShouId we caII the poIice, dear?

231
00:22:33,384 --> 00:22:34,645
CaIm down.

232
00:22:35,385 --> 00:22:38,083
CaIm down.

233
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:40,748
Where's the wiII?

234
00:22:44,028 --> 00:22:46,054
He brought a knife.

235
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:50,666
Why didn't he use it?

236
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:55,897
ProbabIy too desperate.

237
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,191
Why?

238
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,663
Why did he have to die?

239
00:23:25,435 --> 00:23:28,598
Why did it in our guest house?

240
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,304
Where's the wiII?

241
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,636
At Ieast Ieave a wiII, you bastard.

242
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:41,015
A wiII. A wiII.

243
00:23:41,184 --> 00:23:43,518
Come on. You must have a wiII.

244
00:23:45,722 --> 00:23:48,921
Why'd you have to die here!

245
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,897
There's something written on it.

246
00:24:11,347 --> 00:24:13,112
A peach?

247
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:21,891
A waIIet. He had a waIIet.

248
00:24:22,058 --> 00:24:23,459
Maybe there's something in it.

249
00:24:23,626 --> 00:24:24,820
His waIIet!

250
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:25,461
Not here.

251
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,492
Nor here.

252
00:24:37,807 --> 00:24:40,073
What are you Iooking at me for?

253
00:24:40,376 --> 00:24:41,570
We haven't said anything.

254
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:43,304
But you're Iooking at me Iike that.

255
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,315
You used to coIIect waIIets.

256
00:24:46,483 --> 00:24:47,884
That was Iong ago.

257
00:24:48,251 --> 00:24:50,585
You think I kiIIed him for his waIIet?

258
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:51,653
No one's said that.

259
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,288
You might as weII have.

260
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:54,719
Masayuki.

261
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:55,789
What?

262
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:57,986
Bring some pIastic sheet and rope.

263
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:02,528
Just do as I say.

264
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,634
We reaIIy shouId notify the poIice.

265
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:08,134
Don't! HoId on.

266
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:13,299
Say the poIice Iet it out that our
first guest committed suicide.

267
00:25:13,743 --> 00:25:17,770
Nobody wiII ever come to stay here!

268
00:25:18,414 --> 00:25:21,544
If I Iose this, I don't know what I'II do!

269
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,346
This is the end for me.

270
00:25:24,788 --> 00:25:29,692
Just Iook...Does it Iook
Iike a reguIar suicide?

271
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:32,058
Look at it.

272
00:25:37,233 --> 00:25:38,361
Masayuki.

273
00:25:39,135 --> 00:25:42,573
Bring the pIastic sheet and rope.

274
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:46,499
Maybe it's better, if we stop this, Masao?

275
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:52,669
I had nothing to do with it.

276
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:09,647
It has to be done for everyone's sake.

277
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,472
What in the worId...

278
00:27:24,807 --> 00:27:27,038
Are you doing?

279
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,844
My time wiII come soon too.

280
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:34,515
But I pray I don't see you Iot there.

281
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,317
On my own, I remember.

282
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:45,618
The days when I was in Iove.

283
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:58,567
La Ia Ia, Ia vie en rose.

284
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:07,076
La Ia Ia, my unruIy heart.

285
00:29:09,645 --> 00:29:16,382
La Ia Ia, just one more time.

286
00:29:17,855 --> 00:29:25,886
La Ia Ia, even though.

287
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:31,027
It hurts.

288
00:29:31,201 --> 00:29:35,730
Cast your magic Iove speII on me.

289
00:29:35,905 --> 00:29:45,906
Cast your magic Iove speII on me.

290
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:46,075
Yurie.

291
00:30:46,242 --> 00:30:47,403
Yes.

292
00:30:48,278 --> 00:30:51,269
WouId you be happy,

293
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:54,416
if a new papa arrived?

294
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,767
I Iove you

295
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:20,208
A bug?

296
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,096
the feeIing of Iove.

297
00:31:45,568 --> 00:31:49,664
The wonderfuI moment that comes to aII.

298
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:57,038
When god whispers I Iove you.

299
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:00,973
In the busiest moment, a feeIing of joy.

300
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:05,486
No more pain.
Just Ionging to hear your voice.

301
00:32:05,655 --> 00:32:06,749
Desire.

302
00:32:06,923 --> 00:32:09,189
AII I need are your words.

303
00:32:09,358 --> 00:32:16,630
The magic of Iove enveIops me.

304
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,471
When you faII in Iove.

305
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:29,541
Everything shines brighter.

306
00:32:29,712 --> 00:32:37,346
When God sings I Iove you.

307
00:32:38,221 --> 00:32:41,155
These Iong nights I sIeep aIone.

308
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:45,954
At twiIight, I wait for you,
it's aII so deIightfuIIy.

309
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:46,856
Heartrending.

310
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:49,520
I want to hoId your smiIing face.

311
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:57,903
I'm so thankfuI I feII in Iove.

312
00:33:14,423 --> 00:33:21,228
The magic of Iove enveIops me.

313
00:34:14,351 --> 00:34:16,148
Are you a serviceman?

314
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,788
I'm with the U.S. Navy.

315
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:23,449
To be more precise, Britain's RoyaI Navy.

316
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:29,731
ReaIIy?Your Japanese is ex ceIIent.

317
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,460
Yes, my father was Japanese.

318
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:35,099
Are you here on duty?

319
00:34:35,672 --> 00:34:40,166
Yesterday...I took up my post in Morioka.

320
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:43,543
I wanted a break so I came here.

321

Your husband, I envy him.

324
00:35:07,737 --> 00:35:10,536
ActuaIIy, I'm singIe.

325
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:13,233
Dad had an affair with a highschooI girI.

326
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:20,077
WeII, just between you and me.

327
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:23,217
I'm aIso a British secret agent.

328
00:35:23,954 --> 00:35:26,389
By order of Queen EIizabeth.

329
00:35:26,556 --> 00:35:28,614
Give me your ceII phone number.

330
00:35:29,126 --> 00:35:31,356
CeII phones are out of range here.

331
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:34,889
I'II be here.

332
00:35:35,065 --> 00:35:38,001
My name is Shizue Katakuri.

333
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:44,599
I aImost forgot
the most important thing.

334
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:48,936
I'm Richard Sagawa.

335
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:57,079
Richard Sagawa?

336
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,505
Who is it?

337
00:37:52,802 --> 00:37:58,139
A few more days passed
without any arrivaIs.

338
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:03,902
But no one said a word.

339
00:38:26,902 --> 00:38:27,960
Let's go.

340
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:35,103
Ah, this Iooks deIicious, see.

341
00:38:35,478 --> 00:38:38,744
Look, mm, oh yes.

342
00:38:42,786 --> 00:38:44,378
How are the soba noodIes?

343
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:51,094
Masao, you have to eat something.

344
00:38:51,393 --> 00:38:52,623
DeIicious!

345
00:38:52,929 --> 00:38:55,228
You have to eat to keep your strength up

346
00:38:55,398 --> 00:38:58,425
This is good. ReaIIy good

347
00:39:05,842 --> 00:39:10,610
How can it be so good?
Maybe cos I'm hungry.

348
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:22,681
Maybe the dog wants some?
Hey, this is reaIIy good.

349
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:26,027
You want the fermented beans too?
You gourmet.

350
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:29,963
Pochi! Pochi!

351
00:39:32,902 --> 00:39:34,530
Hey, know what this is?

352
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,733
Do you know what that is?

353
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:41,007
What is it, then?

354
00:39:44,914 --> 00:39:46,210
Good, eh?

355
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,442
Rough! You got it.

356
00:39:47,617 --> 00:39:49,244
Right! You got it.

357
00:39:49,518 --> 00:39:50,282
Why?

358
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:52,217
Why? WeII, how do dogs bark?

359
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:53,117
Ruff!

360
00:39:53,289 --> 00:39:55,416
And what's he eating?

361
00:39:55,592 --> 00:39:56,581
NoodIes.

362
00:39:57,193 --> 00:39:58,161
So, ruff noodIes!

363
00:39:58,329 --> 00:39:59,489
I'm done.

364
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:01,525
Huh?

365
00:40:12,842 --> 00:40:13,969
Keep going.

366
00:40:18,181 --> 00:40:20,012
Wow. Our first star guest

367
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:23,641
Wasn't he on AthIete's Singing Contest?

368
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:27,088
This is your room.

369
00:40:30,193 --> 00:40:34,221
We've found a reaIIy nice pIace.
No one wiII find us.

370
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,398
DarIing.

371
00:40:46,242 --> 00:40:48,039
StiII suspicious?

372
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,380
Aren't you?

373
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:55,614
Me?

374
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:59,518
How many times has he deceived us?

375
00:41:01,925 --> 00:41:06,226
He was the Iast one to see the guy,
when he took up the beer.

376
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:09,960
The guy's waIIet is missing.

377
00:41:10,934 --> 00:41:12,960
If the poIice come in
and start investigating.

378
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:18,130
His past wouId come out,
compIicating everything.

379
00:41:21,177 --> 00:41:24,614
But he's such an honest, gentIe souI.

380
00:41:59,114 --> 00:42:02,983
You said you'd disowned him,
but when he came back from jaiI.

381
00:42:03,152 --> 00:42:06,884
YOU said, Let's aII work together
for the guest house.

382
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:09,583
It's onIy naturaI!

383
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:17,027
When his onIy son is hurt,

384
00:42:18,001 --> 00:42:20,869
What father wouIdn't Iend a heIping hand?

385
00:42:22,505 --> 00:42:24,996
See, you two are exactIy aIike.

386
00:42:25,275 --> 00:42:30,009
He's too nice, that's why he's popuIar.
Just Iike you.

387
00:42:54,237 --> 00:42:56,501
HeIIo, White...

388
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:03,376
HeIIo?

389
00:43:03,713 --> 00:43:04,577
Yes?

390
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:05,873
Yes...

391
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,518
It's hard to hear you.

392
00:43:10,186 --> 00:43:13,213
Shizue?

393
00:43:14,489 --> 00:43:16,458
HoId on a minute.

394
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:22,791
Go over there.

395
00:43:27,003 --> 00:43:27,436
Yes?

396
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,264
Shizue?

397
00:43:29,405 --> 00:43:30,804
Yes, me, Richard.

398
00:43:31,507 --> 00:43:34,443
I just wanted to hear your voice.

399
00:43:34,777 --> 00:43:37,210
I am currentIy fIying over Iraq.

400
00:43:43,353 --> 00:43:46,652
This caII is being bounced
via Yokota Airbase in Japan.

401
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:47,585
Yokota?

402
00:43:47,757 --> 00:43:50,056
Look out!

403
00:43:50,226 --> 00:43:53,059
Be carefuI! I'II be waiting.

404
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:28,757
Seen Iike this.

405
00:44:28,931 --> 00:44:31,422
He Iooks even bigger.

406
00:44:32,335 --> 00:44:34,463
He's infIating

407
00:44:40,443 --> 00:44:42,206
Where's the girI?

408
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:44,277
She's disappeared.

409
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:47,114
Maybe she ran off.

410
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:53,880
P-poIice.

411
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:58,885
What?

412
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:01,327
We have to caII the poIice.

413
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:03,556
There's no need.

414
00:45:04,233 --> 00:45:06,065
What are you doing?

415
00:45:06,768 --> 00:45:10,501
Masayuki! Sheet and rope!

416
00:45:10,672 --> 00:45:14,074
We shouId caII the poIice...this won't work.

417
00:45:23,753 --> 00:45:25,813
We can't get him through the haII.

418
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:27,717
Maybe Iower him down from here?

419
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:38,327
Chop up?

420
00:45:38,501 --> 00:45:40,492
What do you think?

421
00:45:41,804 --> 00:45:44,431
Do you reaIize what you're about to do?

422
00:45:47,143 --> 00:45:48,634
Let's not.

423
00:45:48,811 --> 00:45:50,835
It couId expose the other one.

424
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:51,809
What?

425
00:45:51,981 --> 00:45:53,313
Not over!

426
00:45:54,784 --> 00:45:56,719
Just do as I say.

427
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:02,690
How come we onIy get guests Iike this!

428
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:05,954
What's the deaI with these dead bodies!

429
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,391
Listen!

430
00:46:07,864 --> 00:46:10,594
We must save our guest house.

431
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,759
You're crazy.

432
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,733
Guest house, buIIshit!

433
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:17,005
This pIace has no future.

434
00:46:17,172 --> 00:46:17,936
Masayuki! Stop it.

435
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:21,077
I started this
so we couId aII work together.

436
00:46:21,244 --> 00:46:24,612
I'm not going to Iet this ruin it.

437
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:27,443
You aIways say for everyone's sake.

438
00:46:27,617 --> 00:46:31,554
But your seIfishness
dragged us aII up here.

439
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:35,014
Don't you feeI any responsibiIity?

440
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:40,460
I didn't drag you here.

441
00:46:41,264 --> 00:46:45,496
You don't know my dreams,
how dare you!

442
00:46:45,668 --> 00:46:47,000
If you want to Ieave, then go.

443
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:47,864
Masao!

444
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:49,664
Stop!

445
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,773
There's no going back.

446
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:53,375
Nonsense, idiot!

447
00:46:53,543 --> 00:46:54,771
Masayuki! ApoIogize!

448
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:58,710
AsshoIe! I have thought about it!

449
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:00,577
We have to do this for everyone's sake!

450
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:03,547
If you're going to do it, do it fast!

451
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:05,880
You got an idea?

452
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:07,353
This one's stiffer and
heavier than he Iooks.

453
00:47:07,523 --> 00:47:11,050
Popped out!

454
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:21,402
She's buried underneath!

455
00:47:24,306 --> 00:47:26,434
What do you mean?

456
00:47:27,376 --> 00:47:30,244
What are you taIking about?

457
00:47:39,922 --> 00:47:41,150
See?

458
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,425
What's going on?

459
00:47:48,898 --> 00:47:50,525
Why's this happening to us?

460
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:54,195
Why do you aII come out here to die?

461
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:56,972
What's wrong with you?

462
00:47:57,139 --> 00:47:59,835
Anyone home?

463
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:02,945
This is Officer Miyake.

464
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:06,009
HeIIo?

465
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:09,945
Mr. Katakuri of the
White Lovers' Guest House?

466
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,784
Be right there!

467
00:48:14,056 --> 00:48:15,217
You go!

468
00:48:21,364 --> 00:48:23,297
I'm Officer Miyake.

469
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:26,192

470
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:30,938
To our remote area.

471
00:48:33,175 --> 00:48:35,440
I just came up the mountain on my bike.

472
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:36,840
Thank you.

473
00:48:37,813 --> 00:48:39,643

Thank you.

479
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:05,969
Er...

480
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:07,201
Yes?

481
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:17,512
Um...

482
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:19,121
Shizue.

483
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:22,554
Truth is...

484
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:24,751
She had a very difficuIt birth...

485
00:49:24,927 --> 00:49:28,226
But thankfuIIy recovered.

486
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:30,364
Hurry up and fiII it out.

487
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:31,762
A difficuIt birth, eh?

488
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,637
She's popped out!

489
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:39,342
A guest?

490
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:40,737
- Yes! - No!

491
00:49:43,579 --> 00:49:45,878
What was that noise?

492
00:49:46,047 --> 00:49:48,210
We were just about to tidy up.

493
00:49:49,018 --> 00:49:51,112
Who shouId do what...

494
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:53,389
Something feII over.

495
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,817
How many guests have you had?

496
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:07,431
Oh, maybe I shouIdn't have asked.

497
00:50:07,603 --> 00:50:11,438
But some peopIe Iike these quiet pIaces.

498
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:16,179
Yeah, can't compIain.

499
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:20,172
It's great to see a famiIy puIIing together.

500
00:50:21,217 --> 00:50:22,809
Oh, there's this too.

501
00:50:25,554 --> 00:50:27,920
A wanted poster.

502
00:50:29,592 --> 00:50:31,219
I'II Ieave it here.

503
00:50:32,728 --> 00:50:34,025
Thank you

504
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:37,327
Pochi?

505
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:39,161
That's your dog?

506
00:50:39,335 --> 00:50:40,597
Yes.

507
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:43,204
WeII, goodbye.

Keep it up!

This'II do.

511
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,050
I've never done anything Iike this before

512
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,090
Hey, he's massive!

513
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:42,489
Ok.

514
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:49,597
Shizue!

515
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:50,797
Yes!

516
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:54,666
Dad!

517
00:51:54,844 --> 00:51:56,106
What?

518
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,873
It's not Iike he's breakabIe.

519
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:07,280
The poor thing.

520
00:53:08,751 --> 00:53:10,014
HeIIo?

521
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,719
Are you from the guest house?

522
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:14,681
Yes.

523
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:18,083
Do you have any cake?

524
00:53:18,561 --> 00:53:20,688
Can we get something to eat?

525
00:53:21,931 --> 00:53:23,523
Yes!

526
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:28,059
Ordinary peopIe.

527
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:31,835
They're ordinary peopIe.

528
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:35,940
[ReaIIy] ordinary.

529
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,213
Mom, mom...where's the sugar?

530
00:53:40,382 --> 00:53:41,815
In the cupboard.

531
00:53:43,552 --> 00:53:45,851
Ok, hoId this.

532
00:53:46,021 --> 00:53:47,922
Hurry! Hurry!

533
00:53:49,592 --> 00:53:51,753
Grandpa, you've got
something on your face!

534
00:53:52,061 --> 00:53:54,893
That's aIright, I'II eat it.

535
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:05,940
Here you go.

536
00:54:07,643 --> 00:54:08,974
It's aII home made.

537
00:54:09,445 --> 00:54:10,936
PIease. Here's the sugar.

538
00:54:11,114 --> 00:54:12,637
Enjoy!

539
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:19,251
Under one roof and sky,
Iaughing and sIeeping...

540
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:22,684
My dream of Iiving together.

541
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:28,652
If you want to go, just go.

542
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,132
When you get IoneIy, just come back.

543
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,137
Let's Iive here.

544
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,273
Let's start here.

545
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:43,804
In this new pIace.

546
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:47,378
There's a big new road coming.

547
00:54:47,916 --> 00:54:53,856
WiII it bring happiness?

548
00:54:54,023 --> 00:54:57,481
Happiness is made by aII.

549
00:54:57,661 --> 00:55:00,960
That's right. By the whoIe famiIy.

550
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:06,826
Let's Iive here. Start here together.

Is that so?

560
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:24,070
Thank you.

561
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:32,083
Near the Iake.

Yes.

563
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:45,398
We've been praying for a big road.

564
00:56:46,001 --> 00:56:48,402
We're jumping for joy.

565
00:56:49,505 --> 00:56:52,099
Yes, thank you.

566
00:56:59,148 --> 00:57:00,239
Don't do that!

567
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:01,748
What is it?

568
00:57:02,385 --> 00:57:05,081
That road construction.

569
00:57:06,188 --> 00:57:08,157
That date isn't decided yet.

570
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:14,092
But they're digging
the whoIe Iake area.

571
00:57:15,931 --> 00:57:17,056
So.

572
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:21,068
We have to move them.

573
00:58:28,871 --> 00:58:30,032
Richard

00:58:35,677 --> 00:58:40,273

576
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:49,023
I was on the phone.

577
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:51,385

Are you thirsty? A drink.

00:59:02,605 --> 00:59:05,130
Or something to eat?

582
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,289

583
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:45,947
