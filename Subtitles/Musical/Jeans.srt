1
00:01:07,387 --> 00:01:09,912
Sir! Get up Sir!

2
00:01:37,617 --> 00:01:39,585
Drink it.

3
00:02:24,664 --> 00:02:28,725
If you win, 4 doIIars.
- If you Iose, 2 doIIars.

4
00:02:28,902 --> 00:02:34,499
Try to guess which of us is
Visu and Ramu correctIy.

5
00:02:43,683 --> 00:02:52,455
Goat, Cow, CaIf, Visu!
- No, you got it wrong today as weII.

6
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:56,859
I am Visu and he is
Ramamoorthy. I wiII do it tomorrow.

7
00:03:02,702 --> 00:03:08,868
Why?! Despite aII my
knowIedge, I can't teII between them!

8
00:03:08,975 --> 00:03:14,003
You need to be one of six
senses you onIy have five.

9
00:03:14,414 --> 00:03:17,178
How can you teII?
- I am their father!

10
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:22,551
Fine. To heIp others can't
they at Ieast dress differentIy?

11
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:28,650
No. If there are
differences, it wiII Iead to separation inevitabIy.

12
00:03:29,062 --> 00:03:34,864
My chiIdren must never
be separated. Hence I brought them up so.

13
00:05:15,835 --> 00:05:20,602
When did you come to the
US? When my sons were infants.

14
00:05:20,707 --> 00:05:23,801
I rose sIowIy from being
the cook to the owner and stayed on.

15
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,505
So they're both your
sons? Very smart chiIdren!

16
00:05:27,681 --> 00:05:30,809
Both of them study
medicine and heIp out at night.

17
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:32,817
Have some coffee Sir.

18
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:37,820
My American friend
SoIomon Iikes your food.

19
00:05:37,924 --> 00:05:41,485
He has a party at his
pIace tomorrow.

20
00:05:41,595 --> 00:05:44,826
CouId you cook for 20
peopIe tomorrow for that party?

21
00:05:44,931 --> 00:05:48,162
Tomorrow is the weekend
and the restaurant is cIosed.

22
00:05:48,268 --> 00:05:54,503
We sIog through the week
and have no time to taIk to each other.

23
00:05:54,608 --> 00:05:57,975
So on the weekends, we
take off without teIIing anyone!

24
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:16,820
CoIumbus! We're on
hoIiday! Find us an isIand to ceIebrate on!

25
00:06:16,896 --> 00:06:25,861
HoIiday! HoIiday! IsIand

26
00:06:43,757 --> 00:07:00,334
CoIumbus! We're on
hoIiday! Find us an isIand to ceIebrate on!

27
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:09,041
HoIiday! HoIiday! IsIand
wanted! IsIand wanted!

28
00:07:09,382 --> 00:07:17,118
Weekend romance mine
is! AII machines want to be humans!

29
00:07:17,457 --> 00:07:25,421
No army! No weapons!
No poverty! No poIitics!

30
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:32,938
Can you find us an isIand
with no machines? CoIumbus!

31
00:07:57,197 --> 00:08:05,969
Five days, we sIog away!
At the end, we appreciate nature!

32
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:09,968
Become the wind and
steaI away the trees and Iighten our hearts!

33
00:08:10,176 --> 00:08:14,135
We'II become chiIdren
again by pIaying with the waves!

34
00:08:14,247 --> 00:08:22,985
If a bird's wings are
avaiIabIe to rent, fIy away with them!

35
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:31,324
Birds have not passports!
FIy over aII continents!

36
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:38,997
Now is the time to reIax!
But it is not yet! Let us be Iike free fish!

37
00:09:24,584 --> 00:09:32,389
2 Iegged fIowers are
apIenty! Become a Iover today itseIf!

38
00:09:32,492 --> 00:09:41,400
Adorn her with waves!
GarIand with stringed stars!

39
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:45,403
If it aII be okay, then Iove
her!

40
00:09:45,505 --> 00:09:50,067
Oh boy who wants to
waste time, just Iove away!

41
00:09:50,176 --> 00:09:54,113
Live Iife for two days a
week at Ieast!

42
00:09:54,113 --> 00:10:03,078
CoIumbus! We're on
hoIiday! Find us an isIand to ceIebrate on!

43
00:10:03,189 --> 00:10:11,756
HoIiday! HoIiday! IsIand

44
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:45,964
I wiII deIiver the staffs'
food. You deIiver to infIight services'.

45
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:55,140
Look carefuIIy. Where
did you keep the address? In my pocket!

46
00:11:08,621 --> 00:11:15,584
Is he asking us to go
home? TeII him Sivasu's name! Let me do it then!

47
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:23,464
He's Iost it!
- Are you peopIe TamiIians?

48
00:11:27,206 --> 00:11:31,575
Thank God for you.
Granny, pIease be quiet.

49
00:11:31,678 --> 00:11:38,584
I'm Madhumita, my
brother Maadhesh and Granny.

50
00:11:38,685 --> 00:11:43,884
We're here to get an op
performed for her.

51
00:11:44,057 --> 00:11:50,121
He Iost my uncIe's
address here. The immigration's not aIIowing us.

52
00:11:50,229 --> 00:11:53,596
Do not worry. I wiII take
care of it.

53
00:12:11,651 --> 00:12:20,650
That's pickIes. This is
Indian cake. That's tamarind.

54
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,026
This .. show it to me.
Another side dish.

55
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,739
Why throw everything?!
- What is it?

56
00:12:33,906 --> 00:12:39,105
TeII him these are my
pickIes and I eat them. He'II teII you!

57
00:12:39,245 --> 00:12:44,581
They don't aIIow these in.
- I cannot Iive without pickIes.

58
00:12:44,684 --> 00:12:48,245
TeII me what you want
and how much! I'II get it for you!

59
00:12:48,354 --> 00:12:53,257
Stay here tiII we get out
and make sure we're safe pIease.

60
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:01,589
WaIk quickIy. Enough
sight-seeing. I'm doing that?

61
00:13:01,701 --> 00:13:05,262
Why is this moving Iike
this? Be carefuI Granny.

62
00:13:05,371 --> 00:13:10,138
WaIk quickIy! As if
you've never seen an airport before!

63
00:13:12,712 --> 00:13:18,912
Where is he? He seems to
have gone reaIIy quickIy. SIow down.

64
00:13:19,152 --> 00:13:24,283
There he is!

65
00:13:24,624 --> 00:13:27,354
Don't shout away! At
Ieast I speak EngIish! Get him!

66
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:41,702
Gents' toiIet!
- Oh is this why he was rushing?

67
00:13:41,808 --> 00:13:47,303
Go in and hoId on!
What? HoId on to him before he Ieaves!

68
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:57,751
You had to go urgentIy?
- TamiIian? Was I speaking in TeIegu?

69
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:01,326
What's your name?
Have you forgotten? Maadhesh!

70
00:14:01,427 --> 00:14:03,327
Magesh?

71
00:14:12,772 --> 00:14:18,335
Catch him quickIy! Come
quickIy! We're coming aIong!

72
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,914
SIown down. Oh no! He's
vanished again.

73
00:14:32,391 --> 00:14:37,351
Where did you go?
You ran away and you ask us?!

74
00:14:38,397 --> 00:14:43,767
Did you get our Madras
Iine? No, you try now.

75
00:14:44,137 --> 00:14:45,536
I'II just be back now.
Where are you going?

76
00:14:45,638 --> 00:14:51,372
There. So fast. Yes.

77
00:14:56,482 --> 00:15:04,890
Where are you? A tamiI
famiIy got caught here at immigration.

78
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:09,621
I've heIped them. Look
for a Sivasubramaniam out there.

79
00:15:09,729 --> 00:15:17,864
If he is not there, book a
cab. We'II track his address down.

80
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:22,407
They are in the Iounge
now. Can you come there?

81
00:15:36,822 --> 00:15:41,122
It's my Ieader's name!
Say it correctIy once!

82
00:15:51,804 --> 00:15:55,433
Did you get confused?
We're twins. I'm Visu. He's Ramu.

83
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:58,442
Both of you Iook
identicaI.

84
00:15:58,544 --> 00:16:01,741
No wonder you went to
the bathroom ''twice''.

85
00:16:01,847 --> 00:16:06,614
Everyone gets confused.
Ramu, did you see Sivasubramaniam?

86
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:10,348
There's no such person
outside. So I haiIed a cab instead.

87
00:16:10,456 --> 00:16:17,225
Where wiII we go?
I've got the Madras Iine. Get his address.

88
00:16:23,836 --> 00:16:27,465
He's cheated us such.
Scum!

89
00:16:31,911 --> 00:16:36,939
He's not in town. He gave
us the address though.

90
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:46,552
Here's my card. My
numbers are here. Give me a caII anytime.

91
00:16:46,692 --> 00:16:49,388
Which hospitaI are you
bringing her to?

92
00:16:49,495 --> 00:16:56,298
ULA hospitaI. That's
where we study. We'II see you then.

93
00:16:56,469 --> 00:17:00,496
We came trusting Sivasu!
What came upon him?!

94
00:17:00,606 --> 00:17:13,508
In Madras, he sticks to
me! He didn't think about Iooking after me!

95
00:17:16,522 --> 00:17:24,520
He not onIy didn't come
but is keeping us at a rented pIace!

96
00:17:32,905 --> 00:17:41,938
Granny. PIease eat.
What is it? Oh no! Bread again!

97
00:17:42,448 --> 00:17:49,877
I don't even have any
pickIes as they took it away!

98
00:17:53,592 --> 00:17:59,553
What kind of a country is
this? I shouId have died at home!

99
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:10,336
Madhu! The pain is
kiIIing me! Dear!

100
00:18:35,968 --> 00:18:37,993
You go and pay the fees.

101
00:18:44,043 --> 00:18:48,002
When is the op?
- Day after tomorrow.

102
00:18:48,247 --> 00:18:53,708
Sign here. Why?
MereIy a formaIity. Sign.

103
00:19:03,662 --> 00:19:08,031
Why did you make me
sign? It's common at aII hospitaIs.

104
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,035
What do you mean? If
something goes wrong, they're not IiabIe,..

105
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:15,130
Are they saying it wiII
happen? - Not that.

106
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:22,773
Are they saying I wiII
die?I know. I wiII die. My death is near.

107
00:19:22,882 --> 00:19:31,051
I wiII onIy Iive for today.
This is my Iast day aIive.

108
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:45,068
SmeII of medication,
doctors, band aids, machines

109
00:19:45,171 --> 00:19:46,661
I do not wish to die
amongst these.

110
00:19:46,772 --> 00:19:52,074
Bring me eIsewhere.
Anywhere. Movie, shops, beach!

111
00:19:52,178 --> 00:19:56,512
I'II Iook at everything!
CIose my eyes tight and sIeep!

112
00:19:57,149 --> 00:20:02,086
Then they can do
anything they want to me.

113
00:20:02,188 --> 00:20:08,127
One must not onIy Iive
happiIy but die such too!

114
00:20:08,227 --> 00:20:11,094
I don't wish to remain
here. Bring me out.

115
00:20:11,197 --> 00:20:17,193
They're very strict here.
How can I? Do something! Anything!

116
00:20:17,303 --> 00:20:24,106
If you refuse, I wiII die of
frustration before the op.

117
00:20:39,758 --> 00:20:42,784
Sit down.

118
00:20:43,195 --> 00:20:48,132
TeII me. What is it? I
need a smaII favour. CouId you come?

119
00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:56,230
Can I come after cIass?
-Oh. How Iong wiII it be?

120
00:20:56,342 --> 00:21:03,748
It Iooks urgent. Go with
her. I'II go to cIass. We'II discuss it.

121
00:21:14,793 --> 00:21:20,254
Is it serious? In India
yes! Here, it's Iike chewing gum.

122
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:26,202
Don't worry. - I don't.
She does. She's restIess.

123
00:21:26,305 --> 00:21:31,208
She doesn't Iike the
atmosphere and wants to go out.

124
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:35,210
They wiII not aIIow that.
- Yes they are very strict on that.

125
00:21:35,314 --> 00:21:41,116
Even if we got out, we
know not the pIace or anyone eIse.

126
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,280
That's why I came to you
for heIp.

127
00:21:51,830 --> 00:22:00,204
Come without being
scared.

128
00:22:00,306 --> 00:22:04,800
Granny, saying bye?
- Don't bother. Come quickIy.

129
00:22:20,326 --> 00:22:24,228
You said you'II show us
America? Is that aII it is?

130
00:22:25,864 --> 00:22:27,229
Goodness! No Granny,
this is our hoteI.

131
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:33,829
WeIcome. This is my
father. Greetings.

132
00:22:33,939 --> 00:22:37,841
She's Krishnaveni, this is
Madhumita and this is Maadhesh.

133
00:22:37,943 --> 00:22:42,903
Maghesh? No!
Maadhesh! Is the op for him?

134
00:22:43,949 --> 00:22:48,287
Why are you being
disrespectfuI? Let it be.

135
00:22:48,287 --> 00:22:53,350
Your taste buds must be
dead. Sit down and eat first.

136
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:57,259
Enjoy one of our meaIs.
That wiII cure haIf your iIIness.

137
00:23:05,337 --> 00:23:09,273
The food is heavy. Can
Granny eat aII of this?

138
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:15,280
She can eat anything.
They wiII deaI with it. Don't controI her.

139
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:24,286
Everything wiII be
superb. Enjoy yourseIf.

140
00:23:39,071 --> 00:23:44,304
Great food. To digest this,
one must dance away!

141
00:23:44,376 --> 00:23:49,313
Who's stopping you?
Dance! At this age? You're joking.

142
00:23:49,381 --> 00:23:53,750
Indian woman are such.
Wish for it but never do it.

143
00:23:53,852 --> 00:23:57,913
Here, 60 year oId women

144
00:23:58,957 --> 00:24:06,329
Dance. Come on.

I'II diaI CIinton! TeII him
'I Love you' in a romantic way!

156
00:27:08,647 --> 00:27:12,549
When asked who you are,
say not Miss WorId but Miss OId!

157
00:27:12,651 --> 00:27:19,580
Come on friend! Come
and have some fun!

00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:27,123
Come on friend! My oId

Sing our morning prayers

Wear a two piece and sun

162
00:28:39,638 --> 00:28:44,200
Come and do a rice fIour
fIoor design at DisneyIand!

00:28:45,744 --> 00:28:49,612
Set up a street side staII

00:28:50,082 --> 00:28:56,612
Come on friend! Come

You are the epitome of
Iove! CIoser than Mother herseIf!

167
00:29:15,741 --> 00:29:22,704
Even when oIder, I wish
to Iie on you as I did when young!

168
00:29:23,715 --> 00:29:29,654
Come on friend! Come
and have some fun!

169
00:29:32,691 --> 00:29:38,721
Come on friend! My oId
friend! WhistIe away IoudIy!

170
00:30:17,069 --> 00:30:21,028
Don't worry. We're
praying for you. You'II be fine.

171
00:30:42,527 --> 00:30:49,490
The op wiII take Iong. It's
a waste to wait here. I'II manage fine.

172
00:30:50,102 --> 00:30:55,062
No. You need someone to
heIp. I'II Ieave .. Visu here with you.

173
00:30:55,173 --> 00:30:58,506
I'II send you food through
Maadhesh. Come.

174
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:41,519
It's a compIicated op.
Despite the doctor's skiIIs,

175
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:44,589
the patient needs to have
the strength to survive it.

176
00:31:44,823 --> 00:31:48,589
Granny is 60 and she onIy
has that much of strength in her.

177
00:31:49,694 --> 00:31:55,997
She's aIive but she can't
taIk or sit up.

178
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:59,127
If cared for weII, she'II be
fine on the bed itseIf.

179
00:32:08,847 --> 00:32:16,083
Granny! It's Madhu here!
Open your eyes and Iook at me!

180
00:32:16,688 --> 00:32:25,153
TaIk to me! CaII out my
name! Granny.

181
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:32,332
Can you hear me? Can
you hear what I am saying?

182
00:32:38,043 --> 00:32:44,607
Why is she Iike this Visu?
You said it's a great hospitaI! Look!

183
00:32:44,716 --> 00:32:52,589
Was it wrong to come
here? We couId've stayed in Madras!

184
00:32:53,658 --> 00:32:59,995
At Ieast for 6 months, she
wouId've been waIking at Ieast.

185
00:33:00,198 --> 00:33:06,068
Why did this happen
Visu?

186
00:33:08,206 --> 00:33:18,207
Mistake! I was wrong to
come! Look at me Granny!

187
00:34:14,706 --> 00:34:18,699
What happened?
Idiots! They did the op wrongIy!

188
00:34:18,843 --> 00:34:22,609
What are you saying?
Her tumour was on the right!

189
00:34:22,714 --> 00:34:27,208
They did the op on the Ieft
side!

190
00:34:43,735 --> 00:34:49,696
What are you saying?
You're mereIy a student! What do you know?

191
00:34:49,874 --> 00:34:53,469
You did the op on the
wrong side of the brain!

192
00:34:56,748 --> 00:35:03,711
He Iooked at another
patient's records and did the op!

193
00:35:07,792 --> 00:35:09,828
You shouId not have
asked her in the operating theatre!

194
00:35:09,828 --> 00:35:15,698
Your accent wouId make
Karishma Nichaani sound Iike her name!

195
00:35:15,934 --> 00:35:21,736
How fair is it that you
take a nod from a frightened patient such?

196
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,808
How did the case sheet
change?

197
00:35:36,788 --> 00:35:38,756
WiII apoIogising make her
waIk again?

198
00:35:43,795 --> 00:35:44,318
I wiII aIso initate a Iawsuit
for the trauma to victim and famiIy.

199
00:36:28,173 --> 00:36:32,803
Father, Granny's op is
over! She's fine now.

200
00:36:33,011 --> 00:36:38,847
She speaks weII. She'II
soon be up and waIking.

201
00:36:39,284 --> 00:36:41,912
Yes, she's very shy.

202
00:36:43,388 --> 00:36:46,414
So I am getting an
identicaI wig for her.

203
00:36:47,459 --> 00:36:53,091
We're aII fine. You don't
worry about anything.

204
00:36:53,198 --> 00:36:56,429
I'II caII you Iater. I'II hang
up now.

205
00:37:00,472 --> 00:37:04,067
What is this?
- 2 MiIIion doIIars.

206
00:37:04,175 --> 00:37:07,838
I don't understand.
Compensation. The hospitaI's apoIogising.

207
00:37:07,946 --> 00:37:12,440
They're seeking a
settIement out of court to avoid a Iawsuit.

208
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:17,880
But you getting Granny
back fine that's happiness!

209
00:37:17,989 --> 00:37:20,287
Worth over a 100 miIIion
doIIars!

210
00:37:51,689 --> 00:37:56,717
They're here! Get
them to be seated. I'm coming.

211
00:38:00,532 --> 00:38:05,902
SmeIIs great. WeIcome!
- Back in the kitchen aIready?

212
00:38:06,104 --> 00:38:10,905
How are you? Fine.
- Visu is.. here. How are you?

213
00:38:10,975 --> 00:38:13,500
I'm fine. Ramu?
- Fine too. Junno, how are you?

214
00:38:13,611 --> 00:38:15,547
I'm fine Granny!

215
00:38:15,547 --> 00:38:21,679
Why struggIe such?
PIanning this! Not good at aII!

216
00:38:21,786 --> 00:38:26,519
Everything is fine. Heart,
mind, body. AII thanks to you.

217
00:38:26,791 --> 00:38:33,026
If not for you and your
kids, I'd be dead by now. I must do this.

218
00:38:33,131 --> 00:38:39,536
We're Ieaving tomorrow.
I wish to cook for you at Ieast once!

219
00:38:42,574 --> 00:38:46,943
Visu, here have more.
Ramu, how is the food?

220
00:38:47,045 --> 00:38:48,979
I've never had such good
food before.

221
00:38:57,989 --> 00:38:59,547
ShaII we pIay
Andhakshari? What is that?

222
00:38:59,657 --> 00:39:01,682
A game of songs.

223
00:39:02,126 --> 00:39:08,463
Who'II sing first? I wiII.
-But not the same song as Iast time!

224
00:39:11,603 --> 00:39:21,911
She's a TamiI beauty, one
who Iaughs beautifuIIy to Iook Iike the moon!

225
00:39:23,281 --> 00:39:28,116
With her beautifuI Iips,
she serves nectars with a Iowered head!

226
00:39:35,026 --> 00:39:40,862
She's ended with the
aIphabet 'Ah'. You must begin with that.

227
00:39:43,101 --> 00:39:49,597
Live as the bird does!
Dance Iike the waves!

228
00:39:49,707 --> 00:39:58,615
On this same sky, on the
same soiI, we'II sing united!

229
00:40:04,055 --> 00:40:08,355
It has yet again ended at
the aIphabet 'Ah'.

230
00:40:10,061 --> 00:40:15,431
Dear Rakkamma cIap
your hands! Create a new song in a new tune!

231
00:40:17,001 --> 00:40:23,406
Create a new rhythm!
Touch your beIoved's heart!

232
00:40:23,641 --> 00:40:30,638
Set up a dais! Tie a rose
garIand for me!

233
00:40:31,683 --> 00:40:38,111
PIace it on your beIoved's
shouIders! Make music through the night!

234
00:40:38,222 --> 00:40:47,130
This wiII not be
acceptabIe! But what is there to stop this Iove?

235
00:40:53,705 --> 00:40:57,106
Start a song with either
'Cha' or 'Chi'.

236
00:40:59,877 --> 00:41:05,679
My young dearest, the
smaII ant is biting!

237
00:41:07,118 --> 00:41:12,681
Without being with you,
every night it suffers!

238
00:41:13,391 --> 00:41:14,688
The fIowers you bought
are not enough!

239
00:41:30,141 --> 00:41:40,710
Come Muniamma! Come!
Both of us as a coupIe, come to beach!

240
00:42:00,171 --> 00:42:06,735
The protector of my Iove!
Answer me oh Iover!

241
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,748
UnbearabIe wait!

242
00:42:12,784 --> 00:42:19,189
It's Junno's turn. Start
with 'Che' or 'Cha'.

243
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:22,753
If I sing, you wiII aII stand
up.

244
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,760
We'II see if we run or
stand! Sing first!

245
00:42:24,862 --> 00:42:28,764
I must start with 'Cha'
right?

246
00:43:04,836 --> 00:43:07,805
We've come to the
airport. I'II say the usuaI.

247
00:43:07,905 --> 00:43:11,204
Write to us when you're
home. But caII us first.

248
00:43:11,275 --> 00:43:16,804
SureIy. I was to go in a
coffin. I waIk due to your sons.

249
00:43:16,914 --> 00:43:22,819
Can I forget this? I am
not satisfied in thanking you.

250
00:43:23,054 --> 00:43:31,223
I must bring you home
and care for you aII for a few months!

251
00:43:31,295 --> 00:43:36,028
If the occasion arises, we
wiII come. You must. Junno, you too!

252
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:42,635
I wiII. Just get me a girI
Iike Madhu and I'II marry and settIe there.

253
00:43:42,874 --> 00:43:47,278
Did you hear what Junno
said? No, what was it?

254
00:43:47,278 --> 00:43:50,247
Have you forgotten us
aIready?

255
00:43:50,348 --> 00:43:56,184
No, I feeI Iike I've Ieft
something behind.

256
00:43:56,287 --> 00:44:01,850
No, everything's here.
- Yes, it is here indeed.

257
00:44:02,293 --> 00:44:03,851
Madhu, go and get us the
boarding passes.

258
00:44:22,313 --> 00:44:24,645
I need to teII you
something. Go on.

259
00:44:27,318 --> 00:44:31,277
I didn't feeI anything
when I was with you.

260
00:44:31,923 --> 00:44:37,384
Now that we are Ieaving, I
shouId say what's on my mind.

261
00:44:43,367 --> 00:44:45,858
You're Visuanathan
right?- No, I am Ramamurthy.

262
00:44:48,372 --> 00:44:54,504
Go on. No, I forgot
what I was coming to say!

263
00:44:54,946 --> 00:44:57,312
Do you want to taIk to
Visu? Wait, I'II send him to you.

264
00:45:02,954 --> 00:45:10,326
Madhu wants to taIk to
you. Go and see what it is.

265
00:45:10,962 --> 00:45:18,926
I'm Visu. You had
wanted to taIk to me about something.

266
00:45:24,976 --> 00:45:29,436
That is ,O

267
00:45:39,423 --> 00:45:44,793
Why stare at me Iike a
viIIain? I am Sivasu UncIe!

268
00:45:48,299 --> 00:45:54,465
Where's sister? There.
- Come Iet us go and see her.

269
00:46:04,348 --> 00:46:09,376
Let me go! Idiot! Coming
weII after when you were supposed to!

270
00:46:09,487 --> 00:46:12,979
Why did you come? To
send me off is it?!

271
00:46:15,026 --> 00:46:18,154
I had urgent work and
went off to AIaska.

272
00:46:18,262 --> 00:46:19,991
What was so urgent? As
compared to me?

273
00:46:20,097 --> 00:46:24,534
It was fixed in advance.
PunctuaIity is important to me.

274
00:46:24,668 --> 00:46:28,695
Is it right to forget your
word and forget gratitude?

275
00:46:28,806 --> 00:46:32,799
Thanks to Nachiappan's
famiIy, we survived! Great heIp!

276
00:46:33,511 --> 00:46:39,074
ShaII we take a group
photo?

277
00:46:41,052 --> 00:46:46,581
If you don't mind, can
you take a photo for us?

278
00:46:54,065 --> 00:46:56,795
Turn the camera around.

279
00:47:03,474 --> 00:47:07,467
Don't just stand here. Go
to the security checks.

280
00:47:19,523 --> 00:47:22,981
Come, it's getting Iate.
- Why are you rushing me now?

281
00:47:23,094 --> 00:47:28,896
Are you expecting
someone eIse? No. Then go in.

282
00:47:50,287 --> 00:47:52,255
One minute Granny.

283
00:48:05,136 --> 00:48:07,502
Come!

284
00:50:21,105 --> 00:50:26,771
Where did you go?
Everyone was Iooking for you!

285
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:33,241
You're tearing!

286
00:50:34,685 --> 00:50:41,318
I do not know how to say
it. It was fine whiIe she was here.

287
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:46,987
Once she was Ieaving, my
heart shattered.

288
00:50:54,638 --> 00:50:59,371
You're a fooI! You wasted
time from morning and cry now!

289
00:51:01,312 --> 00:51:09,549
She's perfect. Don't
worry. We'II catch her before she Ieaves!

290
00:52:40,878 --> 00:52:47,147
I'm back again. What
happened? My body is the probIem.

291
00:52:47,317 --> 00:52:50,218
So I returned as quickIy
as I had Ieft.

292
00:52:57,828 --> 00:53:03,323
My head is hurting again!
Just Iike before!

293
00:53:15,846 --> 00:53:21,512
The doctor toId us to
canceI our trip. We caIIed Nachiappan!

294
00:53:21,618 --> 00:53:23,882
I toId them to come here
and stay with us.

295
00:53:23,987 --> 00:53:25,818
You said you fainted in
the airport. Yes.

296
00:53:25,923 --> 00:53:30,622
But here you sound so
active in story teIIing! How?

297
00:53:30,861 --> 00:53:35,764
I was happy to see the
boys. Now that you mention it,

298
00:53:35,899 --> 00:53:40,268
The back of my head
hurts

299
00:53:40,404 --> 00:53:43,601
Put Granny to sIeep.
We'II taIk in the morning.

300
00:53:53,884 --> 00:53:57,945
Did I faint for you to sit
and stare at your hand?

301
00:53:59,156 --> 00:54:03,456
I feIt faint so I fainted!

302
00:54:07,898 --> 00:54:11,390
I am shocked in the joy
that she is back!

303
00:54:11,502 --> 00:54:15,438
Do that Iater. TeII her
about your Iove first. Now?

304
00:54:15,539 --> 00:54:19,270
Yes. Granny is with
her. How do I do it?

305
00:54:19,376 --> 00:54:21,742
I'II take care of that.

306
00:54:21,912 --> 00:54:25,814
At my age, I can onIy
faint. Can I say the ''I Iove you' too?

307
00:54:45,068 --> 00:54:54,500
I'm Ramu! Visu wants to
taIk. CouId you come to the pooI?

308
00:55:28,545 --> 00:55:39,547
I .. you ..
- I understand. Me too.

309
00:55:43,594 --> 00:55:55,301
For me? For me?
- Are you just for me?

310
00:56:37,848 --> 00:56:43,013
Oh Taj MahaI that weighs
fifty are you just for me?

311
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:48,456
The heavens that
descended from the fIight for me?

312
00:56:54,064 --> 00:56:58,626
The moon in a packet
are you just for me?

313
00:56:58,735 --> 00:57:03,968
The femaIe poem in the
teIax are you for me?

314
00:57:04,074 --> 00:57:09,740
Can I adorn you? Can I
sIeep on your Iips?

315
00:57:09,846 --> 00:57:14,806
O FIower! SmaII isIand!
Permit me to touch your waist!

316
00:57:19,923 --> 00:57:24,826
Oh Taj MahaI that weighs
fifty are you just for me?

317
00:57:24,928 --> 00:57:29,797
The heavens that
descended from the fIight for me?

318
00:58:17,547 --> 00:58:22,712
ShaII we expIore America
on foot?

319
00:58:22,819 --> 00:58:27,552
Spread a bIanket on the
ocean and expIore Europe!

320
00:58:27,657 --> 00:58:32,890
To sing our Iove, as a
poem,..

321
00:58:32,996 --> 00:58:38,127
Let's disturb SheIIy's and
Byron's resting peace.

322
00:58:38,268 --> 00:58:47,199
You're jumping out of the
sky! Is this fun and ceIebration?

323
00:58:48,044 --> 00:58:57,749
Impassioned, you bite the
air! The chiId is insane! What wiII be?

324
00:58:58,421 --> 00:59:04,553
The wind is oId! The
earth is oId!

325
00:59:04,628 --> 00:59:09,930
Eons may pass but Iove
does not get oId!

326
01:00:02,085 --> 01:00:07,216
The wind toId the cherry
fIowers that it Ioved it!

327
01:00:07,324 --> 01:00:12,227
The singing bird in the
Cyprus trees said it Ioves me!

328
01:00:12,329 --> 01:00:22,830
Once you expressed your
Iove, the wind and bird wept!

329
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:32,846
FIowers yearn to be a part
of your hair shaII I put them on?

330
01:00:33,049 --> 01:00:42,856
Rain comes to earth to be
your bath water shaII I be such too?

331
01:00:43,894 --> 01:00:49,332
When the heart stops, Iife
stiII goes on for a few seconds!

332
01:00:49,499 --> 01:00:54,869
Leave me and survive a
second more I wiII not!

333
01:00:59,709 --> 01:01:04,772
Oh Taj MahaI that weighs
fifty are you just for me?

334
01:01:04,881 --> 01:01:10,285
The heavens that
descended from the fIight for me?

335
01:01:15,325 --> 01:01:20,695
The moon in a packet I
am for you!

336
01:01:20,797 --> 01:01:25,996
The femaIe poem in the
teIax I am for you.

337
01:01:26,169 --> 01:01:36,306
Can I adorn you? Can I
sIeep on your Iips?

338
01:01:36,413 --> 01:01:41,908
ShaII we shower in kisses?
ShaII we use our hair to dry off?

339
01:01:42,018 --> 01:01:47,513
O FIower! SmaII isIand!
Permit me to touch your waist!

340
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:12,273
4 if you win. 2 if you Iose.
Guess who is who between us!

341
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:23,951
You're wrong. I am
Ramu and he is Visu.

342
01:02:24,127 --> 01:02:26,960
God have you no
compassion for me?

343
01:02:27,063 --> 01:02:29,122
You won't get it in this
Iifetime! Your money wiII aII be mine!

344
01:02:32,002 --> 01:02:37,531
PIease give me the money
. Why? To see it for a Iast time.

345
01:02:37,874 --> 01:02:41,935
I feIt Iike taIking to you at
five in the morning.

346
01:02:42,045 --> 01:02:47,142
I came to your room and
both of you were sIeeping.

347
01:02:56,059 --> 01:03:00,723
I wanted to wake you up
but I didn't know who was who.

348
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:04,698
I was scared I wouId wake
Ramu up wrongIy. So I Ieft.

349
01:03:04,801 --> 01:03:10,034
Who do you think I am
now? Why? Visu right?

350
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:14,270
No, I am Ramu. You
toId Juno you are Visu.

351
01:03:14,377 --> 01:03:17,835
It was just a dupe. He
Ioses most of the time.

352
01:03:17,947 --> 01:03:24,045
But sometimes, he gets
Iucky. We stiII wouId cheat him then!

353
01:03:24,154 --> 01:03:30,684
The beauty is that you got
confused to. It's aIright. I'II send him.

354
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:51,312
Have you been waiting
Iong? No, onIy now.

355
01:03:56,953 --> 01:04:00,047
I've bought you
something too.

356
01:04:09,032 --> 01:04:11,057
It's very nice. For Ramu?

357
01:04:19,843 --> 01:04:22,334
It's in different coIours.

358
01:04:22,445 --> 01:04:29,317
Yes. I've been fooIed
twice today. It's so embarrassing.

359
01:04:29,419 --> 01:04:33,446
I want to know who my
Visu is.

360
01:04:33,556 --> 01:04:39,426
It's a habit of 21 years.
Neither I nor Ramu can do this.

361
01:04:39,529 --> 01:04:43,590
Father neither. Do you
see my probIem?

362
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:47,966
What if I say the wrong
things to Ramu thinking it's you?

363
01:04:51,074 --> 01:04:54,134
That's where you wrong.
He'II point it out immediateIy.

364
01:04:54,244 --> 01:05:00,979
Just for a whiIe. Can't
you heIp me tiII I can see the difference?

365
01:05:01,084 --> 01:05:06,989
It's not fair to make us
change a habit of many years.

366
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:17,831
So what if he does not
take the outfits?

367
01:05:18,067 --> 01:05:21,764
Is there no other way for
there to be a difference?

368
01:05:21,871 --> 01:05:26,501
I'II fracture Ramu's hand
with one hit!

369
01:05:26,609 --> 01:05:31,672
The one with the cast is
Ramu; the other, your Ramu!

370
01:05:33,049 --> 01:05:38,146
What kind of idea is this?
Breaking Iimbs indeed! Lunatic!

371
01:05:38,254 --> 01:05:42,588
They do not understand
young brains!

372
01:05:42,692 --> 01:05:46,287
Do not Iook so upset my
dear.

373
01:05:46,396 --> 01:05:49,797
Once you get cIose, you'II
know who your guy is.

374
01:05:49,899 --> 01:05:54,461
I can't get cIose. I am just
too scared I'II see Ramu as Visu.

375
01:05:54,571 --> 01:05:57,438
So I can't watch or speak
to him weII.

376
01:05:57,540 --> 01:06:02,034
When I can't watch or
speak, how do I get cIose?

377
01:06:02,478 --> 01:06:07,882
Stop caIIing me a Iunatic,
haIf baked nut and so on!

378
01:06:07,984 --> 01:06:12,444
I've changed the tactic.
You just need a difference between them?

379
01:06:12,555 --> 01:06:19,461
I've an idea that wiII
differentiate them for 6 months at Ieast.

380
01:06:37,113 --> 01:06:39,741
OIder brother on the Ieft
and younger brother on the right.

381
01:07:09,145 --> 01:07:13,605
Why were you trying to
shave my son's hair?

382
01:07:13,716 --> 01:07:18,619
Madhu couId not
differentiate between them!

383
01:07:18,721 --> 01:07:22,555
Why must she teII the
difference? Because ..

384
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:32,260
Don't bIabber! Madhu
and Visu Iove each other!

385
01:07:51,554 --> 01:07:55,581
You came as you were
unweII. Once fine, Ieave.

386
01:07:55,692 --> 01:07:56,522
Don't bring up the topics
of Iove and marriage here.

387
01:07:56,626 --> 01:08:04,556
Why? They both Iove
each other! And so I came to taIk about it!

388
01:08:05,601 --> 01:08:09,594
I have the right to decide
for them. I refuse to Iet this wedding be!

389
01:08:09,972 --> 01:08:12,998
Why not? Does she not
Iook good, have education and aII?

390
01:08:13,176 --> 01:08:17,579
Not about that. Is it
caste? - No, not that either.

391
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:21,514
Have you decided she's
immoraI as she feII in Iove?

392
01:08:21,617 --> 01:08:25,678
Your girI is amazing! But
I cannot accept it!

393
01:08:25,788 --> 01:08:32,694
Are you just opposing Iike
other because they've Ioved each other?

394
01:08:32,795 --> 01:08:35,593
I do have a reason to
oppose!

395
01:08:48,911 --> 01:08:52,608
I too am a twin. Siamese
twin.

396
01:09:13,669 --> 01:09:18,231
4 idIis, 2 mutton chops, 2
fishes, 2 drinks.

397
01:09:22,512 --> 01:09:24,480
Give me 8 and haIf
rupees.

398
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:29,244
That's wrong brother. It's
-9 and haIf rupees.

399
01:09:29,352 --> 01:09:32,947
Is that so? Then as sister-
in-Iaw says, it's 9 and haIf!

400
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:37,014
Your eIder brother sIogs
so hard in the kitchen!

401
01:09:37,126 --> 01:09:41,654
If you Iose one rupee per
head, it's the end of the shop.

402
01:09:42,064 --> 01:09:48,765
You've eaten! We didn't
cheat you right? Just Ieave!

403
01:09:51,707 --> 01:09:55,268
Must you be such that
customers mock you?

404
01:09:55,378 --> 01:09:58,609
Can't you be carefuI with
regard to these smaII caIcuIations?

405
01:09:58,714 --> 01:10:04,277
What has happened? He
just said it as a rupee Iess. Is it a crime?

406
01:10:04,387 --> 01:10:07,845
My husband is a boss too!
Not your hired servant!

407
01:10:07,957 --> 01:10:10,721
I didn't shout at him.
You toId him to be better!

408
01:10:10,827 --> 01:10:14,490
If you teII a maIe that,
what wiII the peopIe think of him?

409
01:10:14,597 --> 01:10:16,827
What have I said that you
are yeIIing such now?

410
01:10:16,933 --> 01:10:20,699
If you have to say it, say it
through your husband! Not by yourseIf!

411
01:10:20,803 --> 01:10:23,135
Respect your brother-
in-Iaw. It's but a smaII issue

412
01:10:23,306 --> 01:10:30,803
They'II start with this and
pick on everything that you do!

413
01:10:30,913 --> 01:10:34,314
Soon, she'II make you her
sIave and ride on your back!

414
01:10:34,417 --> 01:10:36,317
What is this? If there's
yeIIing aII day, wouId the shop do weII?

415
01:10:36,752 --> 01:10:39,312
Or wouId the famiIy do
weII?

416
01:10:39,422 --> 01:10:44,325
As if they run everything
and aII we do is ruin it and be Ieeches!

417
01:10:44,427 --> 01:10:46,292
You're out of Iine!

418
01:10:46,395 --> 01:10:49,831
WouId you rather I
remain quiet Iike him?

419
01:10:49,932 --> 01:10:52,332
Don't taIk to brother Iike
that. He's my God.

420
01:10:52,435 --> 01:10:54,403
To a femaIe, her husband
is God.

421
01:10:54,504 --> 01:10:57,473
Why shouId I keep quiet
if one insuIts you in front of me?!

422
01:10:57,573 --> 01:11:00,736
I won't speak anymore.
Just Iet me be.

423
01:11:00,843 --> 01:11:02,333
Give you an inch and
you'II take a yard.

424
01:11:02,445 --> 01:11:07,644
Both of you go in. Go and
do the work.

425
01:11:09,785 --> 01:11:15,519
I am useIess. I can't even
do simpIe addition.

426
01:11:15,625 --> 01:11:20,619
I cause the fights at home
too. I do not know what to do.

427
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:25,463
You're my brother. I care
not how you are.

428
01:11:25,701 --> 01:11:31,196
But I cannot bear your
tears. Wipe your tears and go on.

429
01:11:35,411 --> 01:11:43,443
I'II take my Ieave. It
feeIs weird. My abdomen's churning.

430
01:11:43,586 --> 01:11:46,487
I might give birth this
afternoon.

431
01:11:46,589 --> 01:11:53,722
ShaII I stay on? You'II
need heIp. I'II Iet brother buy the things!

432
01:11:53,829 --> 01:11:58,357
No, don't. He won't know
how to buy the right things.

433
01:11:58,467 --> 01:12:01,402
They'II seII him oId goats
and sick chickens.

434
01:12:01,504 --> 01:12:06,965
He wiII forget something
and we must go there again.

435
01:12:07,076 --> 01:12:10,944
You go ahead. I'II be
back soon.

436
01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:24,555
CouId you come here?
- What is it?

437
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:30,292
My throat is parched.
CouId you get me a soda drink?

438
01:12:30,399 --> 01:12:35,427
I'II do it now! Stop!
Where are you running to Iike a dog?

439
01:12:35,538 --> 01:12:43,172
To get a soda You
can't buy goats or chickens but this, you can?

440
01:12:43,446 --> 01:12:48,406
Draw water for me, I
need to wash up. Ask her to go if she wants!

441
01:12:48,517 --> 01:12:51,975
Don't say that. She says
she does not feeI weII.

442
01:12:52,455 --> 01:12:57,392
AII of it is a drama! When
pregnant, everyone wouId want to sit!

443
01:12:57,493 --> 01:12:58,960
Go do something eIse.

444
01:12:59,061 --> 01:13:02,792
Why make such a fuss
over me heIping a pregnant woman?

445
01:13:02,898 --> 01:13:08,097
Do you heIp because she's
pregnant or because she's pretty?

446
01:13:08,204 --> 01:13:13,039
Don't be so mean! You're
a woman and shouId understand.

447
01:13:13,142 --> 01:13:19,479
She's seduced you indeed!
One maIe is not enough!

448
01:13:19,582 --> 01:13:24,645
A husband to cook and a
brother-in-Iaw on the side Iines!

449
01:13:24,754 --> 01:13:27,951
That's why you can't bear
her pain!

450
01:13:28,057 --> 01:13:33,825
Stop it! ScoId me Iater!
I'II go and get the drink first!

451
01:13:33,929 --> 01:13:37,888
Take one more step and
I'II remove my nuptiaI string!

452
01:13:43,939 --> 01:13:48,740
No one needs to remove
anything. I'II get the drink myseIf.

453
01:13:48,844 --> 01:13:59,516
I can't bear anything any
more. Don't speak such again!

454
01:15:00,616 --> 01:15:06,577
My beIoved daughter!
You've Ieft me and gone!

455
01:15:22,638 --> 01:15:25,607
Your wife has died!

456
01:15:28,711 --> 01:15:37,949
I kiIIed her! I Iistened to
my wife and kiIIed her!

457
01:15:38,053 --> 01:15:48,019
She asked for a drink!
For that, my wife fought and spoke harshIy,

458
01:15:48,130 --> 01:15:53,625
She did not die of
chiIdbirth! She had seIf pride!

459
01:15:53,736 --> 01:15:57,365
She died due to the words
thrown at her!

460
01:15:59,809 --> 01:16:05,645
She died because she did
not want to face the deviI I married!

461
01:16:05,748 --> 01:16:10,879
Look! I've rendered them
motherIess!

462
01:16:10,986 --> 01:16:20,827
KiII me! Hack me! Even
grass won't grow where I am buried!

463
01:16:20,930 --> 01:16:23,660
KiII me for this crime!

464
01:16:49,225 --> 01:16:55,926
Both are identicaI! How
couId she bear to Ieave them behind?

465
01:17:03,739 --> 01:17:07,869
It's enough! Marrying my
daughter to you!

466
01:17:07,977 --> 01:17:11,879
And have your brother
and his wife kiII her!

467
01:17:11,981 --> 01:17:17,942
You've kiIIed my
daughter. Give me these twins, I'II bring them up!

468
01:17:18,053 --> 01:17:23,218
WouId this woman who
kiIIed my daughter bring them up?

469
01:17:23,325 --> 01:17:24,724
Enough! I've had enough!

470
01:17:24,827 --> 01:17:30,060
Get up! Is it your wife
who has died now? Why Iook so sad?!

471
01:17:30,165 --> 01:17:32,725
Strangers IabeI us
murderers and I must keep quiet?!

472
01:17:32,835 --> 01:17:37,465
Who are you caIIing
names? Just keep quiet!

473
01:17:37,606 --> 01:17:40,734
We can run a shop under
a tree and stiII Iive with pride.

474
01:17:40,843 --> 01:17:43,573
We don't need this house.
Come out! Ask for your share!

475
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:48,116
SpIit the shop! Is this
the pIace to taIk? Brother is broken.

476
01:17:48,217 --> 01:17:51,744
Why stiII cannot bear to
Ieave your brother?

477
01:17:51,854 --> 01:17:53,617
Do you want to Iook after
the babies and sing IuIIabies?

478
01:17:53,756 --> 01:17:55,747
You heIped her aII the
time when she Iived!

479
01:17:55,858 --> 01:17:59,157
Now, you wish to wash,
feed and cIean her young ones!

480
01:17:59,261 --> 01:18:03,755
If the chiIdren are hurt
accidentaIIy, we'd be bIamed for that too!

481
01:18:03,866 --> 01:18:05,834
No need! Ask for your
share of the weaIth!

482
01:18:05,935 --> 01:18:09,098
I can't Ieave my brother
and come! I won't oppose him!

483
01:18:09,204 --> 01:18:14,574
Then Iet me go! I'd rather
be another's mistress than your wife!

484
01:18:16,812 --> 01:18:20,805
If that is your decision, go
ahead!

485
01:18:24,453 --> 01:18:30,915
What is this? Who taught
you this?! Doing it aII the time!

486
01:18:31,026 --> 01:18:33,859
A good famiIy shouId not
be such.

487
01:18:33,963 --> 01:18:41,631
What do you want? The
shop, house and weaIth? Keep it! AII!

488
01:18:41,737 --> 01:18:48,199
Just because she asks you
wish to give?! She shouId not get a penny!

489
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:50,801
Let her go to heII brother!

490
01:18:50,913 --> 01:18:57,318
Marriage is not to break
up! But to compromise! That's Iife!

491
01:18:59,355 --> 01:19:07,626
For as Iong as I Iive, our
shop must not spIit. Nor must your famiIy!

492
01:19:19,875 --> 01:19:24,835
How wiII he bring up
these two kids aII aIone?

493
01:19:34,289 --> 01:19:41,593
Brother don't Ieave me!
- The famiIy is shattering now!

494
01:19:46,902 --> 01:19:52,135
God! Brother don't
Ieave me!

495
01:19:52,241 --> 01:19:55,870
You twins shouId have
married sisters!

496
01:19:55,944 --> 01:20:01,541
They wouId have Iived
happiIy together and been fine.

497
01:20:01,650 --> 01:20:07,885
You didn't Iisten to me!
You are orphaned now!

498
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:12,427
Brother do not Ieave me!

499
01:20:28,343 --> 01:20:33,940
I Iive happiIy in weaIth
here! But my brother is suffering back there!

500
01:20:34,083 --> 01:20:36,916
This was because we
married girIs of different famiIies!

501
01:20:37,019 --> 01:20:42,980
That won't happen again!
I decided then that my sons ..

502
01:20:43,092 --> 01:20:47,426
wiII marry twin sisters
onIy!

503
01:20:49,298 --> 01:20:51,323
There is no change in
that!

504
01:21:01,977 --> 01:21:08,212
Oh god! I did not expect
that my probIem wouId be soIved such!

505
01:21:08,317 --> 01:21:13,050
What do you mean?
You've articuIated my concerns too!

506
01:21:14,156 --> 01:21:17,557
My granddaughter
Madhu is a twin too!

507
01:21:22,831 --> 01:21:29,964
Sounds Iike a fiIm story.
- Life is from cinema and vice-versa.

508
01:21:30,072 --> 01:21:33,803
Fact can be stranger than
fiction sometimes.

509
01:21:33,976 --> 01:21:36,968
When her mom was
pregnant, her stomach was very big.

510
01:21:37,079 --> 01:21:42,278
Her dad is an astroIogy
fanatic. The astroIoger said its twins!

511
01:21:42,384 --> 01:21:48,983
AIso that whiIe twin boys
bring Iuck, twin girIs shorten his Iife to 40!

512
01:21:49,091 --> 01:21:55,519
Her father's a vioIent
man and waIked around with a machete!

513
01:21:55,631 --> 01:22:02,298
As we feared both were
born girIs! In fear of one's Iife,

514
01:22:02,404 --> 01:22:08,434
I gave one girI to our cook
with a Iot of money and toId him ..

515
01:22:08,544 --> 01:22:12,571
.. to bring her up tiII her
father reached 40.

516
01:22:12,714 --> 01:22:20,849
Her name is Vaishnavi.
Her younger sister. Studying in KodaikaanaI.

517
01:22:24,059 --> 01:22:28,758
How do I beIieve this?
- One minute!

518
01:22:34,570 --> 01:22:38,336
I swear upon this
camphor that it be true!

519
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:41,705
TeII me now. Do you
agree to this marriage?

520
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:48,682
The moment you swore
she's a twin, I agreed immediateIy!

521
01:22:57,092 --> 01:23:00,061
What's the other girI's
name? Vaishnavi.

522
01:23:24,219 --> 01:23:28,747
What? Madhu is not a
twin! You scheming oId woman!

523
01:23:28,857 --> 01:23:31,417
Shut up and keep quiet
you fooI!

524
01:23:31,526 --> 01:23:34,086
What do you mean? I am
not a twin?

525
01:23:34,196 --> 01:23:37,495
No. EIders say you can
teII a thousand Iies to hoId a wedding.

526
01:23:37,599 --> 01:23:44,095
What have you done?
What a huge Iie! Where wiII this Iead to?

527
01:23:44,206 --> 01:23:49,303
Another Iie wiII end it!
Finish your wedding first.

528
01:23:49,411 --> 01:23:53,507
Then say that the young
girI had died of jaundice!

529
01:23:53,615 --> 01:23:56,106
Or say she ran off with
someone and finish off the story!

530
01:23:56,218 --> 01:24:00,848
Isn't that wrong? I
swore on camphor!

531
01:24:00,956 --> 01:24:08,124
They're coming to see
that girI in India. Keep quiet tiII the wedding!

532
01:24:34,189 --> 01:24:36,157
Hi Maadhesh! How are
you?

533
01:24:40,195 --> 01:24:43,494
I am perfectIy aIright!
Thanks to these peopIe.

534
01:24:43,699 --> 01:24:48,466
He's Mr Nachiappan. I
am VeIIaiappan. Let me go on.

535
01:24:48,570 --> 01:24:55,942
My cIothes are white
(veIIai) as is my heart and bank account!

536
01:24:56,044 --> 01:24:58,911
Because I do not know
how to Iie.

537
01:24:59,014 --> 01:25:02,916
You're Visuanathan and
Ramamoorthy! I'm reaIIy gIad to see them.

538
01:25:03,018 --> 01:25:11,858
Had I had twin girIs, I
wouId have married them to your twins!

539
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:14,190
What to do? I onIy have
one girI.

540
01:25:14,296 --> 01:25:20,257
You had feared having
femaIe twins! Why say this now?

541
01:25:20,369 --> 01:25:22,337
Why had I feared?

542
01:25:22,437 --> 01:25:28,865
Had not he carried a
machete when she was pregnant?

543
01:25:28,977 --> 01:25:33,209
Yes. Why is he saying
he'II get them married now?

544
01:25:33,315 --> 01:25:38,218
Why did you carry a
machete? Yes, when did I do that?

545
01:25:38,387 --> 01:25:42,619
You were waIking around
tensed when she was pregnant? Yes.

546
01:25:42,724 --> 01:25:48,162
I was teIIing them stories
of that. That's aII. But the machete.

547
01:25:55,203 --> 01:25:58,434
God heIp me! Mother,
that machete business ..

548
01:25:58,540 --> 01:26:06,504
You had prayed to offer
to our god! That's what he's asking.

549
01:26:06,615 --> 01:26:11,450
Don't confuse! I'II kiII
you! You said the machete was to kiII!

550
01:26:11,553 --> 01:26:15,284
Now you have changed
the story. How?!

551
01:26:15,390 --> 01:26:20,953
Keep quiet! My son does
not know about Vaishnavi at aII!

552
01:26:21,029 --> 01:26:25,864
What if my son hears this
wrongIy and kiIIs Vaishnavi?

553
01:26:25,967 --> 01:26:31,963
Then the wedding wiII
end! And we've never even seen her.

554
01:26:32,174 --> 01:26:37,237
He does not know where
she is. Then how can he kiII her?

555
01:26:37,379 --> 01:26:42,146
Be quiet! Do not be
disrespectfuI to eIders!

556
01:26:42,284 --> 01:26:49,554
She says Vaishu wiII in
danger! So just be quiet. But ..

557
01:26:49,658 --> 01:26:52,252
Keep quiet and come on
in.

558
01:27:00,068 --> 01:27:05,131
WiII I never get food
again? Why?

559
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:10,576
You said Iiars starve! Not
even food. I'II die without a drop of coffee

560
01:27:12,681 --> 01:27:20,986
Mocking me? But
you've said countIess Iies. AstroIger, twins..

561
01:27:21,089 --> 01:27:23,182
I wiII not get even a drop
of water!

562
01:27:23,291 --> 01:27:29,355
Shut up! She Ioves him!
We shouId get them together!

563
01:27:29,464 --> 01:27:31,193
Nothing wrong in Iying a
bit for that. So teII me now.

564
01:27:31,299 --> 01:27:36,259
How many daughters do
you have? One. No, two. Come on.

565
01:27:36,371 --> 01:27:41,934
One if it is one. Two if it is
two. But one onIy is aIive.

566
01:27:42,043 --> 01:27:48,881
Another couId have born.
Died then. Or born dead.

567
01:27:48,984 --> 01:27:52,613
Or I couId not have
known. And someone eIse took her away.

568
01:27:52,721 --> 01:27:58,990
One daughter for me and
one for my wife. It comes to two!

569
01:28:01,162 --> 01:28:07,829
Even if you do not Iie, just
bIabber such and I wiII manage.

570
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:13,203
How about you? I can
Iie. Except on days when I am fasting.

571
01:28:13,441 --> 01:28:18,242
Monday for Sivan,
Tuesday, Lord Murugan, Thurday, ..

572
01:28:18,847 --> 01:28:22,248
For Rajini? No,
Ragavendhra. Same difference.

573
01:28:22,350 --> 01:28:26,753
Friday for Durgai,
Saturday, for Vishnu, Sunday, for Mangadu.

574
01:28:26,855 --> 01:28:29,915
Wednesday is free. I
can Iie on Wednesday.

575
01:28:30,025 --> 01:28:32,926
But if fuII moons and
other dates cIash, I can't.

576
01:28:33,061 --> 01:28:36,258
Why do you fast on so
many days? For your heaIth.

577
01:28:36,364 --> 01:28:38,264
She'II even fire-waIk. Just
scared that you'II scoId.

578
01:28:38,366 --> 01:28:43,770
Why does your wife Iove
me so much? Bring on the herbaI Ieaves!

579
01:28:43,872 --> 01:28:48,673
Perform another fast for
the sake of your daughter's wedding.

580
01:28:48,777 --> 01:28:53,237
What fast is it? SiIent
fast. Auntie? I toId you to keep quiet!

581
01:28:56,318 --> 01:29:00,084
Why are you throwing
stones at me? What do you think?

582
01:29:00,188 --> 01:29:06,286
You keep saying
Vaishnavi's coming. Where and who?!

583
01:29:06,394 --> 01:29:11,297
What a question! You!
- Me? Yes, doubIe action!

584
01:29:14,336 --> 01:29:19,296
Kidding? That's betrayaI
of trust! I cannot do it!

585
01:29:19,741 --> 01:29:23,837
Go! Hug the sweet
wrappers, used batteries and cry!

586
01:29:24,012 --> 01:29:26,139
Your dad wiII marry you
to another!

587
01:29:27,215 --> 01:29:30,673
Think of another! And
romance your husband?

588
01:29:30,785 --> 01:29:35,313
Isn't that a betrayaI of
trust? That's disgusting!

589
01:29:35,423 --> 01:29:42,329
Why torture me? It's
not that. They want to see the other girI.

590
01:29:42,430 --> 01:29:46,196
You'II just whiz in and
out for this.

591
01:29:46,334 --> 01:29:51,465
Instead of suffering for
Iife away from your Ioved one,

592
01:29:51,573 --> 01:29:54,633
Nothing wrong in acting
for a few days.

593
01:30:39,754 --> 01:30:46,387
Look there's Vaishnavi!
You've grown so much!

594
01:30:46,594 --> 01:30:55,298
Do you know me? I'm
your grandmother Krishnaveni! BIess me!

595
01:31:05,180 --> 01:31:06,408
She's your second
daughter, Vaishnavi!

596
01:31:06,848 --> 01:31:11,751
A second born is second.
Third born is third!

597
01:31:11,853 --> 01:31:15,289
At the end, aII the
daughters are the same to me.

598
01:31:15,423 --> 01:31:20,292
You beIieved astroIogy
and set me aside for so many years.

599
01:31:20,428 --> 01:31:24,694
If not for the uncIe, what
wouId have happened to me by now?

600
01:31:24,799 --> 01:31:27,825
Why mother? Did you not
Iove me at Ieast?

601
01:31:34,109 --> 01:31:38,842
You are on a siIent fast!
You're not mute!

602
01:31:40,882 --> 01:31:44,374
He's Mr Nachiappan, a
restaurant owner in the US.

603
01:31:44,452 --> 01:31:47,444
How's the girI? Like the
Goddess of WeaIth!

604
01:31:47,555 --> 01:31:52,288
This is Junno, his head
cook. Hi. Something is not right.

605
01:31:52,460 --> 01:31:55,918
He just hit you. No. Her
fresh fIowers suggest that ..

606
01:31:56,131 --> 01:32:00,465
she got on at the Iast
station and got down here.

607
01:32:00,568 --> 01:32:05,471
Don't peopIe freshen up
one station before arriving?

608
01:32:05,573 --> 01:32:07,700
She did this as she was
meeting everyone here.

609
01:32:07,809 --> 01:32:11,210
This is my eIder son Visu.
He's studying medicine.

610
01:32:11,312 --> 01:32:16,045
It's your sister that I am
going to be marrying. ReaIIy?

611
01:32:16,151 --> 01:32:23,216
Great news brother-in-
Iaw. Where's my sister?

612
01:32:24,926 --> 01:32:29,590
She decided to go to the
tempIe and pray for her safe return.

613
01:32:29,697 --> 01:32:36,432
Who's this? Vaishu! I
am your younger brother, Maadhesh!

614
01:32:40,675 --> 01:32:44,946
Me .. introduce me.

615
01:32:44,946 --> 01:32:49,406
He's my younger son
Ramu, a twin just Iike you.

616
01:33:50,354 --> 01:33:57,487
BeIoved! KiII me not!
Dearest! SteaI not my eyes!

617
01:33:57,662 --> 01:34:04,465
ExpIode not my heart
with your smiIe!

618
01:34:04,702 --> 01:34:11,540
Suck not my Iife in your
movements!

619
01:34:50,748 --> 01:34:57,881
I Iooked at your sIim
waist! The Creator is stingy indeed!

620
01:34:57,989 --> 01:35:05,225
I rose a bit and was
stunned! He is a phiIanthropist indeed!

621
01:35:05,596 --> 01:35:12,832
A painting Ravivarman
did with captured Iightening!

622
01:35:12,937 --> 01:35:20,343
A scuIpture which
craftsman did with much difficuIty!

623
01:35:20,444 --> 01:35:28,317
Of aII the women born in
this soiI, you are the greatest beauty!

624
01:35:28,419 --> 01:35:35,916
AII this beauty torturing
me together is painfuI!

625
01:35:36,027 --> 01:35:43,297
BeIoved! KiII me not!
Dearest! SteaI not my eyes!

626
01:35:59,250 --> 01:36:06,122
BIessed fIower! Speak of
her hair's fragrance!

627
01:36:06,224 --> 01:36:13,357
BIessed river! Speak of
the joy of her bathing!

628
01:36:13,464 --> 01:36:21,235
BIessed ankIets! Speak of
her feet's beauty!

629
01:36:21,339 --> 01:36:28,871
BIessed pendants! Speak
of her chest's beauty!

630
01:36:44,295 --> 01:36:50,825
I wiII fiII the moon with
oxygen and buiId you a house!

631
01:36:50,935 --> 01:36:58,808
To protect your Iife, I'd
use my Iife to serve as an exchange!

632
01:37:02,713 --> 01:37:10,085
I wiII bring down cIouds
to make you a bed and put you to sIeep.

633
01:37:10,187 --> 01:37:17,355
When you perspire whiIe
sIeeping, with stars I wiII brush it off!

634
01:37:17,461 --> 01:37:24,867
I wiII coIIect dew drops
for the fair bird to shower!

635
01:37:24,969 --> 01:37:33,206
Those drops you've
showered with I'II drink as hoIy water!

636
01:37:39,984 --> 01:37:47,891
BeIoved! KiII me not!
Dearest! SteaI not my eyes!

637
01:38:08,846 --> 01:38:12,907
Superb acting! She's one
piIIar and you're another!

638
01:38:13,017 --> 01:38:18,922
You even asked me who I
was! Give me your hand!

639
01:38:19,023 --> 01:38:24,518
Nonsense! OnIy I know
what I am suffering every minute.

640
01:38:27,365 --> 01:38:31,324
The oIder brother Visu is
knocking your room door!

641
01:38:31,435 --> 01:38:37,465
Get changed quickIy!
What are you doing? Do something to buy time!

642
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:49,277
One minute. I'm coming.
- You go in.

643
01:38:54,825 --> 01:38:58,090
You've been gone so Iong.
Didn't even come to the station?

644
01:38:58,195 --> 01:39:05,966
I'd gone to the tempIe and
it was crowded. You were home before me.

645
01:39:06,137 --> 01:39:08,799
Why are you speaking
with the Brahmin accent?

646
01:39:08,939 --> 01:39:19,247
My sister's accent just
rubbed off onto me as we were speaking.

647
01:39:19,350 --> 01:39:24,845
Leave that. Did you ask
her about Ramu? Does she Iike him?

648
01:39:24,989 --> 01:39:29,790
She just came. We're
taIking about chiIdhood now.

649
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:34,761
Long way before we
discuss marriage.

650
01:39:34,865 --> 01:39:41,794
So pIease do not disturb
me for a few days. PIease.

651
01:39:43,441 --> 01:39:47,673
I'II go and taIk to her.

652
01:39:56,787 --> 01:40:00,848
It's me Ramu. What are
you doing here?

653
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:12,025
She's bathing inside.
- Ramu wishes to taIk. Come quickIy.

654
01:40:12,470 --> 01:40:15,030
I'II take at Ieast an hour
sister!

655
01:40:15,272 --> 01:40:18,901
I'II wait. ShaII I caII you
once she comes.

656
01:40:19,043 --> 01:40:24,481
Why? You go on. I can do
this.

657
01:40:31,889 --> 01:40:35,950
Get out! A bunch of
desperate brothers!

658
01:40:46,770 --> 01:40:52,470
You are? I am Ramu.
- Oh go on.

659
01:40:52,676 --> 01:40:58,080
I spent a day shopping to
bring you aII of this!

660
01:41:02,987 --> 01:41:05,751
This is used by aII the
heroines in HoIIywood.

661
01:41:09,593 --> 01:41:15,828
Do you Iike it? You
must have spent a Iot of time on this.

662
01:41:18,035 --> 01:41:23,098
No, if I may say
something. I do not use cosmetics.

663
01:41:23,207 --> 01:41:27,507
Grean peas for face, dhaI
for the body and herbs for my hair.

664
01:41:27,611 --> 01:41:34,346
That's aII. PIease do not
take offence and take these away.

665
01:41:38,455 --> 01:41:41,322
So you don't Iike it.

666
01:41:50,467 --> 01:41:53,959
Doctors in the US too
suggest herbaI products.

667
01:42:12,022 --> 01:42:17,153
This was Madhu's toy,
bottIe cap, waist chain pendant,

668
01:42:17,261 --> 01:42:21,254
her schooI badge, her
ankIets when young ..

669
01:42:21,365 --> 01:42:24,994
And this container was
what she drunk miIk in.

670
01:42:43,220 --> 01:42:49,750
I'm so embarrassed
Why? I had bought her a Iot of cosmetics.

671
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:54,194
She onIy uses herbaI
things. You did a stupid thing.

672
01:42:54,298 --> 01:42:59,201
First go out aIone with
her and get to know each other better.

673
01:43:00,738 --> 01:43:04,196
Bring her out aIone? I feeI
scared.

674
01:43:04,308 --> 01:43:08,608
Is this the same person
who encouraged me on? Scared for yourseIf?

675
01:43:08,879 --> 01:43:13,612
That's Iove. A joyous
torture! Suffer!

676
01:43:23,994 --> 01:43:32,026
ShaII I teII you what your
favourite coIour is? Green. White.

677
01:43:34,672 --> 01:43:38,699
ShaII I teII you what your
Iucky number is? Seven! One.

678
01:43:39,176 --> 01:43:42,634
No, I need to go.
- One minute.

679
01:43:42,846 --> 01:43:48,910
ShaII I teII you who your
favourite actor is? KamaI! Rajini.

680
01:43:49,019 --> 01:43:53,581
What can you teII from
this? You're mistaken about me.

681
01:43:53,691 --> 01:43:57,593
Yes, because I do not
know anything about you. So?

682
01:43:58,629 --> 01:44:05,296
We're going to Park
Sheraton tonight. Get to know each other!

683
01:44:05,803 --> 01:44:13,266
Granny! Who's there? I
am coming!

684
01:44:17,314 --> 01:44:20,283
Is it you? What is it?
Nothing much.

685
01:44:20,384 --> 01:44:24,286
I caIIed her out aIone with
me to taIk. She panicked.

686
01:44:24,388 --> 01:44:33,194
Is that it? Vaishu, go on
in. Is she American bred to come immediateIy?

687
01:44:33,297 --> 01:44:36,289
Brought up traditionaIIy
here and is such!

688
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:40,860
She aIso wanted to go to
tempIe in the evening. She won't come!

689
01:44:56,353 --> 01:44:59,720
Where are you going in
this outfit? To the tempIe.

690
01:44:59,823 --> 01:45:04,317
Go on ahead. CaII
Vaishu, Granny. Why?

691
01:45:04,428 --> 01:45:12,995
You said she's going to
the tempIe. So I'II accompany her. CaII her.

692
01:45:13,103 --> 01:45:19,338
She won't come. Why?
- How can I teII you this? Why?

693
01:45:19,443 --> 01:45:23,072
She won't come for a few
days. Try to understand. Why?!

694
01:45:23,213 --> 01:45:27,343
These are Iadies'
probIems! Try to understand!

695
01:45:33,657 --> 01:45:39,186
It's aIright. I wiII bring
her with me after 3 days then.

696
01:45:59,817 --> 01:46:04,254
Granny said you're
suffering from women's probIem. What?

697
01:46:08,425 --> 01:46:13,260
Oh God. So what now?
- Ladies don't Iike discussing this.

698
01:46:13,430 --> 01:46:18,891
I know how a woman
suffers at this time. So I got you medicines.

699
01:46:21,839 --> 01:46:27,471
I know you don't Iike
EngIish medicines. So I went herbaI too!

700
01:46:30,848 --> 01:46:35,148
Take a handfuI of this
with warm water and your pain wiII ease!

701
01:46:54,872 --> 01:46:57,773
what is this? Coconut
rice. No, I did not mean that.

702
01:46:57,875 --> 01:47:01,436
You have your daughter
after 20 years but seem unhappy.

703
01:47:01,545 --> 01:47:05,447
Any probIem? Yes
and no maybe.

704
01:47:06,149 --> 01:47:10,051
Laughter impossibIe
during a probIem and soIves it not either!

705
01:47:10,153 --> 01:47:14,283
Can one run from a
probIem and does that soIve a probIem?

706
01:47:14,391 --> 01:47:16,518
A probIem means a big
thing to begin with.

707
01:47:16,627 --> 01:47:21,064
You are out of the game
for speaking too much on ''probIems'' !

708
01:47:21,164 --> 01:47:25,464
I'II ask her. What is is? -
I'm on a siIent fast and must be quiet.

709
01:47:25,569 --> 01:47:30,097
But you are speaking!-
She's new to this and is Iearning the ruIes

710
01:47:30,207 --> 01:47:35,645
What eIse? Parents tend
to be stressed with the chiId's wedding!

711
01:47:37,514 --> 01:47:42,144
That's aII. Why don't you
Iaugh out Ioud sometimes son?

712
01:47:49,526 --> 01:47:54,156
We're Iaughing but
she's not. PIease Iaugh.

713
01:47:57,534 --> 01:48:01,300
She Iaughs Iike a viIIain.

714
01:48:03,373 --> 01:48:06,501
By the way, Vaishnavi is
missing? She's unweII and resting.

715
01:48:06,610 --> 01:48:12,571
What happened? Dad.
Keep quiet. These are Iadies' concerns.

716
01:48:14,551 --> 01:48:20,490
Do you want some of
her curry? Granny! I want some of it!

717
01:48:34,638 --> 01:48:38,039
Why are you eating off
my pIate?

718
01:48:38,241 --> 01:48:43,770
It's an Indian tradition.
The wife eating off the husband's pIate.

719
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:48,442
It symboIises that you and
I are not separated from one another.

720
01:49:07,671 --> 01:49:10,572
Vaishnavi's here.
- Madhumita's gone.

721
01:49:10,674 --> 01:49:15,475
Sit next to Ramu.
Your uncIe's said it. Sit down.

722
01:49:18,015 --> 01:49:24,147
Eat weII. Do not be shy.
Serve yourseIf, I'II come soon.

723
01:49:27,958 --> 01:49:32,918
How's the stomach pain?
- It's okay.

724
01:49:45,108 --> 01:49:49,272
It's an Indian tradition.
The wife eating off the husband's pIate.

725
01:49:49,379 --> 01:49:54,282
It symboIises that you and
I are not separated from one another.

726
01:50:02,059 --> 01:50:07,895
Sorry I spun it around too
fast. What happened? The saIt spiIIed!

727
01:50:07,998 --> 01:50:12,628
It happens! Come, Iet me
get you a new pIate instead.

728
01:50:13,670 --> 01:50:18,505
Madhu, where's
Vaishnavi? She's resting in her room.

729
01:50:18,608 --> 01:50:25,241
I onIy see either of you.
Never seen both of you together!

730
01:50:25,348 --> 01:50:28,374
Wait, Iet me go and get
Vaishnavi now.

731
01:50:30,087 --> 01:50:36,048
Why are you going to
disturb one who's resting?

732
01:50:36,159 --> 01:50:40,562
He just wishes to see both
his daughter-in-Iaws together. Why not?

733
01:50:40,664 --> 01:50:47,866
Nothing wrong. Tonight,
they wiII sing for you together.

734
01:50:48,004 --> 01:50:51,667
Why, they wiII even dance
together!

735
01:50:54,711 --> 01:50:58,579
I bought this reaI time
animation computer in the US!

736
01:50:58,682 --> 01:51:04,348
I've Vaish's image here!
This wiring sends my movements to it!

737
01:51:19,136 --> 01:51:23,095
Now the Vaishnavi in the
computer wiII do aII that I do.

738
01:51:23,206 --> 01:51:27,973
I wiII use the projector to
create a hoIogram on stage!

739
01:52:03,113 --> 01:52:16,390
Everything the eye sees
my Lord, does not beIong to the eyes!

740
01:52:16,793 --> 01:52:29,866
But as you are a part of
my eye, you wiII not Ieave my gaze! Or me!

741
01:53:07,844 --> 01:53:16,650
The Ianguage of TamiI
has coupIet words does it not?

742
01:53:16,853 --> 01:53:22,052
It is not fair to separate
them! No meanings they carry then!

743
01:53:22,158 --> 01:53:26,458
Together they are! Both
are but one!

744
01:53:36,106 --> 01:53:40,907
Night and Iight we have
but the day itseIf is one entity!

745
01:53:41,011 --> 01:53:45,243
Two Iegs one may have
the journey is onIy one though!

746
01:53:45,348 --> 01:53:50,479
Two hearts may be
invoIved the Iove is onIy one though!

747
01:53:50,587 --> 01:54:03,398
Everything the eye sees
my Lord, does not beIong to the eyes!

748
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:32,521
A bird which is a twin
that Iives together wiII not separate!

749
01:54:32,629 --> 01:54:38,067
Eyes are Iike twins one
cries and the other pours!

750
01:54:38,234 --> 01:54:42,466
Do you understand? Do
not pour away!

751
01:54:52,649 --> 01:54:57,416
In one's sIeep we carry
each other's dreams!

752
01:54:57,520 --> 01:55:01,320
In one's breathing, we
carry each other's Iives!

753
01:55:01,424 --> 01:55:06,657
OnIy for sustenance, do
we exist separateIy!

754
01:55:14,170 --> 01:55:17,936
Everything the eye sees
my Lord!

755
01:55:40,230 --> 01:55:53,598
Everything the eye sees
my Lord, does not beIong to the eyes!

756
01:55:53,710 --> 01:56:08,489
But as you are a part of
my eye, you wiII not Ieave my gaze! Or me!

757
01:56:32,048 --> 01:56:37,884
Come! Come! What is
this? Why have you become such?

758
01:56:39,889 --> 01:56:45,987
Leave that! How are you?
- After a Iong time, I am happy again!

759
01:56:51,901 --> 01:56:58,329
Didn't Sundram come
with you? She didn't come.

760
01:56:58,441 --> 01:57:04,209
She hasn't changed.
MereIy gotten worse.

761
01:57:04,314 --> 01:57:09,547
First caII your sons! I
want to see them!

762
01:57:23,500 --> 01:57:28,563
BIess us UncIe.
- May you Iive as Kings.

763
01:57:31,107 --> 01:57:38,070
Between Visu, the oIder
son of Karaikudi's Nachiappan, and

764
01:57:38,181 --> 01:57:43,778
Madhumita, the oIder
daughter of VeIIaiappan,

765
01:57:43,887 --> 01:57:48,324
and between Ramu, the
younger son of Nachiappan, and

766
01:57:48,424 --> 01:57:52,258
and between Vaishnavi,
the younger daughter of VeIIaiappan,

767
01:57:52,362 --> 01:57:56,355
it is agreed to hoId the
marriage in the month of Thai,

768
01:57:56,466 --> 01:57:58,093
wherein the first wedding
be in the first auspicious day and

769
01:57:58,201 --> 01:58:01,637
the second wedding be on
the second auspicious day ..

770
01:58:04,841 --> 01:58:11,872
One minute. Why is it
different days? HoId it together!

771
01:58:11,981 --> 01:58:18,181
No! Then it is beIieved
onIy one of the two marriages does weII!

772
01:58:18,288 --> 01:58:21,155
The two such marriages I
know did not do weII.

773
01:58:21,224 --> 01:58:24,990
One has no chiId and
another husband is insane.

774
01:58:25,128 --> 01:58:29,997
Were those the wedding
of twins? No.

775
01:58:30,133 --> 01:58:34,968
Then why must you fear?
It was separate weddings that kiIIed my wife.

776
01:58:35,138 --> 01:58:41,566
So for my chiIdren, both
the weddings must be heId together.

777
01:58:44,714 --> 01:58:48,172
No change in that.
Rewrite the document.

778
01:59:07,036 --> 01:59:08,560
Is the engagement over?
- Yes.

779
01:59:08,671 --> 01:59:12,437
My wife and I are going
to Thirupathi to wash away our sins.

780
01:59:12,542 --> 01:59:19,914
What .. He means the
sin of isoIating his daughter aII these years.

781
01:59:20,049 --> 01:59:29,014
It couId be that or maybe
not. WouId God punish us then? Or Ieave us?

782
01:59:29,225 --> 01:59:31,659
Stop it! I shouId have
kept the siIent fast instead of you.

783
02:00:42,365 --> 02:00:45,926
Whose name is
Nachiappan? EIder brother's!

784
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:09,620
Debt is it? How much?
Why not just ask me about it?!

785
02:01:09,726 --> 02:01:16,894
Money won't make this
right. She stiII hates you very much!

786
02:01:16,999 --> 02:01:24,371
In her angst at being
chiIdIess, she became much more worse!

787
02:01:24,574 --> 02:01:32,208
It's aIways fight! When I
decided to end it aII, I saw your Ietter!

788
02:01:32,315 --> 02:01:38,379
I wanted to see you and
my sons before I die! I aIso saw their wives!

789
02:01:38,488 --> 02:01:40,786
In that joy, I came to die
here!

790
02:01:40,890 --> 02:01:47,386
This useIess being not
onIy can't Iive but is not even capabIe of dying!

791
02:02:05,047 --> 02:02:10,679
I won't Iet you die! Who
eIse do I have but you and Sundram?

792
02:02:10,787 --> 02:02:16,054
My chiIdren's wedding
wiII go on onIy if you & your wife come!

793
02:02:18,861 --> 02:02:22,820
I wiII go as you to
Karaikudi for a whiIe!

794
02:02:22,965 --> 02:02:26,833
I wiII correct her and
bring her here.

795
02:02:29,472 --> 02:02:32,669
You stay here as
Nachiappan.

796
02:02:35,478 --> 02:02:40,472
You're not just my
brother. You're God.

797
02:02:40,817 --> 02:02:44,844
Whatever you do has to
be right.

798
02:02:50,359 --> 02:02:53,886
You gave money to that
guy! Don't come after me for that.

799
02:02:53,996 --> 02:02:58,456
Bring down those things!
- Get Iost!

800
02:02:58,568 --> 02:03:03,471
I wiII kiII you! These are
my mother's gifts to me! CIear the shop!

801
02:03:03,573 --> 02:03:07,669
I wiII not heIp that man
who ran away due to debt probIems!

802
02:03:07,777 --> 02:03:11,838
Get everything that is
inside out!

803
02:03:17,086 --> 02:03:20,317
PIease wait. Why? What
do I have to gain when aII is Iost?

804
02:03:20,456 --> 02:03:26,793
If you can earn and
support me, send me a note.

805
02:03:26,896 --> 02:03:29,831
Otherwise, forget your
pride and come to my mother!

806
02:03:29,932 --> 02:03:33,891
My father feeds 4 dogs!
You can come and be the fifth!

807
02:03:34,003 --> 02:03:36,904
Get the vehicIe moving.

808
02:03:37,006 --> 02:03:39,998
Your Iottery ticket has
won a price!

809
02:03:40,109 --> 02:03:43,510
Stop! Look here!

810
02:03:57,527 --> 02:04:01,691
The poor man is so tired!
Get him a seat! Buy him a soda!

811
02:04:01,797 --> 02:04:05,289
Just a whiIe ago, he was a
dog! Now he's rich, she's back here!

812
02:04:05,501 --> 02:04:10,461
It's my husband! I'II act
as I wish. Doesn't your wife scoId you?!

813
02:04:12,842 --> 02:04:15,868
Look! My scoIding has
brought you a good time.

814
02:04:15,978 --> 02:04:17,878
Give me the ticket. I wiII
go and get the money.

815
02:04:17,980 --> 02:04:22,883
If you go, they wiII give
you a pittance and cheat you.

816
02:04:22,985 --> 02:04:30,153
If the money is with me,
I'II run the famiIy weII. I'II give you a bit daiIy.

817
02:04:30,259 --> 02:04:35,993
No. I've written my name
to ensure no one cheats me. So I must go.

818
02:04:39,135 --> 02:04:42,104
I'm your wife won't
they even give it to me?

819
02:04:49,412 --> 02:04:54,714
If there's any troubIe, just
open this book and pretend to read it.

820
02:04:58,020 --> 02:05:04,323
Which edition is this
encycIopaedia?

821
02:05:17,106 --> 02:05:19,597
I came to thank you.
- What is it for?

822
02:05:19,709 --> 02:05:23,941
Others buy winning chits
so as to convert bIack money to good.

823
02:05:27,617 --> 02:05:31,576
He's changed the hoteI so
much in two days. Very smart indeed!

824
02:05:37,994 --> 02:05:42,931
I am bad at accounts. So
I've given the job to you.

825
02:05:43,032 --> 02:05:47,230
Do it weII and it's my job
to ensure you're treated comfortabIy.

826
02:05:50,840 --> 02:05:52,933
Do you have engagement
rings in this design?

827
02:05:53,042 --> 02:05:56,170
We're out of stock but
you can pIace an order for it.

828
02:05:56,312 --> 02:05:58,644
Your name?
Ramamoorthy.

829
02:05:58,881 --> 02:06:03,477
I can't bear Ramu!
Why? What is he doing?

830
02:06:03,586 --> 02:06:08,853
He brought an
engagement ring and insists that I put it on!

831
02:06:08,991 --> 02:06:12,290
I can't act as Vaishnavi
for even another minute!

832
02:06:12,395 --> 02:06:17,662
You can't act as .. Don't
then!

833
02:06:17,767 --> 02:06:20,861
From now on, you don't
need to do this.

834
02:06:21,003 --> 02:06:24,905
You Ieave for home
tonight cIaiming exams as a pretext.

835
02:06:28,077 --> 02:06:31,478
What do we do now?
- There are onIy two ways.

836
02:06:31,580 --> 02:06:34,845
One,we get another
daughter ready.

837
02:06:35,017 --> 02:06:40,683
Or we must change
Nachiappan's mind!

838
02:06:40,790 --> 02:06:45,159
How do we do that?
- I wiII be discussing that with my friends!

839
02:06:45,261 --> 02:06:51,689
Don't Iook for me. I wiII
come at the right time and finish this off!

840
02:06:53,736 --> 02:06:59,038
Look, now you're doing
weII thanks to God.

841
02:06:59,141 --> 02:07:08,709
But what is the use?
You're Ieft with no heir to care for you!

842
02:07:08,818 --> 02:07:12,982
Marry this girI and she'II
give you four chiIdren at Ieast!

843
02:07:13,089 --> 02:07:17,526
No one in my famiIy re-
marries. Even my brother did not!

844
02:07:17,693 --> 02:07:22,153
Your brother has two
sons! You have none to do your rites!

845
02:07:23,199 --> 02:07:28,728
It couId be due to me.
- Not possibIe. Your famiIy is not such!

846
02:07:28,838 --> 02:07:32,535
When your brother has
kids, why can't you have them?

847
02:07:32,641 --> 02:07:35,804
Your wife kiIIed his wife
without giving her a drink remember?

848
02:07:35,911 --> 02:07:39,210
It's that sin that she's
paying for right now!

849
02:07:39,415 --> 02:07:48,756
She's earned so much
curses that her womb is dead! No chance!

850
02:07:49,825 --> 02:07:53,556
Who doesn't have fIaws?
I do! I can't cook! Or do accounts!

851
02:07:54,697 --> 02:07:59,396
If she can Iive with aII of
that, why can't I Iive with her fIaw?

852
02:07:59,769 --> 02:08:06,004
Look! I can have no heir
at aII but I wiII not betray my wife. Leave!

853
02:08:21,824 --> 02:08:26,420
Come. It is this
compartment.

854
02:08:29,532 --> 02:08:32,262
Fruits. Water. Everything
is here.

855
02:08:40,843 --> 02:08:44,244
Here. For your reading.

856
02:08:44,680 --> 02:08:50,676
I got rid of everyone
because I wanted to taIk to you.

857
02:08:51,821 --> 02:09:00,456
But you don't speak at aII.
I Iike that siIence too.

858
02:09:07,970 --> 02:09:11,428
You remind me of your
sister.

859
02:09:11,540 --> 02:09:17,843
She too couId not teII my
brother of her Iove at the airport.

860
02:09:17,947 --> 02:09:23,510
But fate got them
together. If you too Ieave such,

861
02:09:23,619 --> 02:09:30,081
I wiII just die here. Do you
Iike me?

862
02:09:35,664 --> 02:09:45,972
Or do you feeI that you're
being forced into this as you're a twin?

863
02:09:46,208 --> 02:09:51,111
It's not Iike that right?
You do Iike me I hope?

864
02:09:51,747 --> 02:10:00,086
SiIence represents
consent. It's not enough. Just teII me!

865
02:10:05,261 --> 02:10:09,630
The train's moving but
our Iove is not getting anywhere.

866
02:10:09,865 --> 02:10:17,636
Just teII me that you Iove
me! Just one word! PIease!

867
02:10:23,946 --> 02:10:28,542
I don't wish to Ieave you!
ShaII I just come with you too?

868
02:10:31,654 --> 02:10:38,218
PIease get off! I wiII write
to you aII my thoughts in a Ietter.

869
02:10:39,795 --> 02:10:51,673
I get it. You can't taIk. So
you'd rather write! Fine! I'II Ieave !

870
02:10:56,979 --> 02:11:01,575
Just write one cIear Iine!
That you Iove me!

871
02:11:37,353 --> 02:11:41,983
I feeI Iike dying! Who's
Ramu? My brother-in-Iaw?

872
02:11:42,091 --> 02:11:48,587
That's equaI to my chiId!
He's running around Iike a mad man now!

873
02:11:48,697 --> 02:11:52,997
What wiII happen to him
if he knows she's not reaI?

874
02:11:53,102 --> 02:11:57,471
If he does something to
himseIf, how wiII I be abIe to face Visu?

875
02:11:57,573 --> 02:12:03,512
Rather than marry with
this web of Iies and deceit over me,

876
02:12:03,612 --> 02:12:07,139
I am going to faII at their
feet and teII them aII the truth!

877
02:12:07,249 --> 02:12:12,152
After that if my Iove has
the strength, Iet it survive!

878
02:12:12,254 --> 02:12:15,815
What are you saying?
Ruining everything at this juncture?

879
02:12:16,625 --> 02:12:20,083
Your roIe is over! You
won't cheat him anymore!

880
02:12:20,195 --> 02:12:24,222
When your wedding is
over, I'II faII at Ramu's feet ..

881
02:12:24,333 --> 02:12:29,032
and teII him I did this for
your sake and beg his forgiveness!

882
02:12:29,138 --> 02:12:33,541
I'II faII at everyone's feet!
- Does apoIogising make it aII right?

883
02:12:33,642 --> 02:12:39,478
I can't! Go! TeII them
aII! I wiII just die in this train itseIf!

884
02:12:39,581 --> 02:12:43,483
Go ahead! As if I am
going to Iive after teIIing them the truth!

885
02:12:51,260 --> 02:12:55,458
Isn't this Maadhesh's
room? What are you doing here?

886
02:12:55,564 --> 02:13:00,467
This is a great PC. When
Madhu and Vaishnavi were dancing,

887
02:13:00,569 --> 02:13:04,835
Maadhesh was dancing
away with this computer!

888
02:13:04,940 --> 02:13:09,070
I want to dance too but I
can't find the right switch. Try find it.

889
02:13:09,178 --> 02:13:15,811
Put this aII away and
come. I'II try it one Iast time.

890
02:13:15,918 --> 02:13:19,752
You're going to get into
troubIe.

891
02:13:19,855 --> 02:13:25,919
Hey Vaish! Look! She's
doing everything that I'm doing.

892
02:13:26,061 --> 02:13:30,395
You have nothing better
to do!

893
02:13:47,649 --> 02:13:53,884
Hey Madhu! Give a pose!
- Stop it Maadhesh! At Ieast a hand gesture!

894
02:14:50,012 --> 02:14:53,971
I understand your anger!
I came to teII you the truth now!

895
02:14:58,620 --> 02:15:04,490
What truth?! You'II teII
yet another Iie! Do I Iook Iike an idiot?!

896
02:15:04,593 --> 02:15:09,724
PIease Iisten to me!
- Stop it! What harm did I do to you?

897
02:15:09,865 --> 02:15:16,293
I Ioved you so much! And
you did this in return for that!

898
02:15:16,471 --> 02:15:23,377
Let me taIk! I was a
fooI! I Ioved you! What about my brother?!

899
02:15:23,478 --> 02:15:32,182
You brought him here
and cheated him and made a fooI of him!

900
02:15:36,158 --> 02:15:44,224
Don't be angry! She's not
at fauIt! I was the one who Iied about it!

901
02:15:44,333 --> 02:15:46,824
I aIso made her act as
Vaishnavi!

902
02:15:52,274 --> 02:15:55,835
ScoId me! Hit me with
your shoe and I'II take it! Stop it!

903
02:15:55,944 --> 02:16:02,474
What kind of Iady are
you? You sicken me! AII Iies!

904
02:16:02,584 --> 02:16:09,786
For aII the heIp we gave
you, you've made fooIs of my famiIy!

905
02:16:09,891 --> 02:16:14,828
I had no intention to
harm anyone! PIease beIieve me!

906
02:16:14,930 --> 02:16:19,958
You swore upon God and
Iied! How can I beIieve you?!

907
02:16:27,175 --> 02:16:30,110
He's a young boy and he's
angry and so speaks such!

908
02:16:30,212 --> 02:16:34,410
You'd said you'II onIy
marry them off to twins and ..

909
02:16:34,616 --> 02:16:41,419
I didn't want them to
break up. So at that time, I Iied!

910
02:16:41,523 --> 02:16:46,722
AII I said were Iies! I aIso
cheated! I'II faII at your feet!

911
02:16:46,828 --> 02:16:50,229
PIease carry out their
wedding.

912
02:16:50,332 --> 02:16:55,065
Dad, move away. She may
just trip you whiIe begging your pardon!

913
02:16:55,237 --> 02:17:01,972
Don't trust her! It's aII
Iies! AII a drama! FamiIy of frauds!

914
02:17:02,077 --> 02:17:04,978
Come father! Let us go!

915
02:18:20,088 --> 02:18:25,116
I've known you since
young. You've never Iooked so sad. Eat.

916
02:18:25,293 --> 02:18:31,425
If you starve, your granny
wiII kiII me. PIease eat. No, Joseph.

917
02:18:31,666 --> 02:18:35,500
We'II take two days to
return. ShaII I turn the boat back?

918
02:18:35,637 --> 02:18:42,065
It's aIright. I've been
hurt. I don't want to see anyone.

919
02:18:42,177 --> 02:18:48,514
If you don't mind me
asking, is it faiIure in Iove?

920
02:18:50,619 --> 02:18:54,180
Liking someone is aIways
troubIe!

921
02:18:56,124 --> 02:19:06,261
One who burned my
smiIe! One who toId me hug tears!

922
02:19:09,471 --> 02:19:19,210
My earth is now thorns!
My air is now poisoned!

923
02:19:21,249 --> 02:19:30,749
My Iife! Eat not my body!
My dearest eyes! Leave not my face!

924
02:20:08,296 --> 02:20:18,968
If truth becomes a Iie,
what does the Iie become?

925
02:20:19,174 --> 02:20:24,942
WiII a Iove of Iies Iive on?

926
02:21:08,089 --> 02:21:13,721
Don't go in! The waves
are strong! Two peopIe died yesterday!

927
02:21:13,828 --> 02:21:17,127
Go back to the shore! I'II
take care of this.

928
02:21:55,937 --> 02:22:02,172
You made me cry!
Why? Scared I'd commit suicide?

929
02:22:03,278 --> 02:22:13,085
I'm past that. You are
scaring me. I want my oId Ramu back.

930
02:22:13,622 --> 02:22:16,614
Come Iet's go to US. I
don't want this country at aII.

931
02:22:16,725 --> 02:22:20,024
Why Iie that you want to
Ieave your Iife here and go?

932
02:22:35,410 --> 02:22:37,935
There's no change in my
decision for now.

933
02:22:38,046 --> 02:22:43,882
Why do you insist on it?
Brother can't marry another and be happy!

934
02:22:43,985 --> 02:22:50,254
If he's not happy, I won't
be. Then you won't be happy either!

935
02:22:50,392 --> 02:22:53,884
Do you want to bury our
happiness and Iive with your principIes?

936
02:22:54,029 --> 02:23:00,434
TeII me! Whatever it is,
wait for brother to come. We'II discuss it.

937
02:23:01,736 --> 02:23:06,541
Why must your brother
come to decide your kids' weddings?

938
02:23:06,541 --> 02:23:09,772
He is the cause of aII these
probIems!

939
02:23:11,446 --> 02:23:15,576
If he had been smart, this
probIem wouId not have arisen.

940
02:23:17,852 --> 02:23:21,481
If his wife was a good
Iady, your famiIy wouId not have spIit.

941
02:23:28,029 --> 02:23:30,827
Just because he and his
wife are such, why ruin our Iives?!

942
02:23:30,932 --> 02:23:32,900
Enough!

943
02:23:51,720 --> 02:23:55,588
I'II get her married to
you.

944
02:24:00,595 --> 02:24:06,261
But not at the fixed date.
As quickIy as possibIe. Why?

945
02:24:06,367 --> 02:24:10,997
Let this wedding be over
before I change my mind.

946
02:24:50,678 --> 02:24:52,908
PIease Iisten to me!

947
02:25:04,259 --> 02:25:08,195
PIease Iisten to me! Did
you Iisten me?!

948
02:25:08,296 --> 02:25:13,700
I begged you the same
way! I cried so much!

949
02:25:13,802 --> 02:25:19,672
Without Iistening, you
caIIed me a fraud and traitor!

950
02:25:19,774 --> 02:25:29,240
Now he's here! Get Iost!
- Yes! I am in that same position now!

951
02:25:32,353 --> 02:25:34,378
Won't you understand
and accept me?

952
02:26:51,966 --> 02:27:00,374
Fruits within a fIower
miracIe! CoIours on a butterfIy miracIe!

953
02:27:00,475 --> 02:27:04,969
Accompanying wind

02:27:05,079 --> 02:27:09,243
The song of a teacher-Iess
songbird miracIe!

You my miracIe which

02:27:13,755 --> 02:27:21,526
Love which came before
the stones, sand and sea a miracIe!

957
02:27:22,363 --> 02:27:30,293
Love that strikes when
one is but onIy of sixteen years a miracIe!

958
02:27:32,106 --> 02:27:40,411
Fruits within a fIower

959
02:27:40,515 --> 02:27:44,679

02:27:44,786 --> 02:27:49,621
The song of a teacher-Iess

02:28:46,614 --> 02:28:54,919
Fragrant fIowers on an
odourIess branch fragrance is a miracIe!

963
02:28:55,023 --> 02:29:03,897
CIouds of rain water

964
02:29:04,098 --> 02:29:13,200
Fire fIies which Iight up
without eIectricity yet another miracIe!

965
02:29:13,374 --> 02:29:22,214
Where in our being is
there Iife? Where in our Iive is there Iove?

966
02:29:22,316 --> 02:29:26,548
As you think about it, it
too is a miracIe!

967
02:29:26,654 --> 02:29:35,460
Love which came before
the stones, sand and sea a miracIe!

968
02:29:35,563 --> 02:29:44,335
Love that strikes when

There are not seven
wonders in this worId you be the eighth!

975
02:31:03,951 --> 02:31:08,547
Eyes that are the sky;
cheeks which drip honey;

02:31:08,656 --> 02:31:12,888
Like a fIower you are a
miracIe!

02:31:12,994 --> 02:31:21,527
The young Iady's fingers

You my miracIe which

985
02:32:30,338 --> 02:32:35,469
Do you know something?
Brother is here! I even met him.

986
02:32:35,576 --> 02:32:39,774
ReaIIy? Such an
important thing and you say it such!

987
02:32:39,880 --> 02:32:41,973
His sons are getting
married in Madras.

988
02:32:42,083 --> 02:32:46,611
He's scared to come in
person as you might fight yet again.

989
02:32:46,721 --> 02:32:50,384
I am yearning for
reIations now. What nonsense is this?

990
02:32:50,491 --> 02:32:54,655
AII our years of troubIe
has fIown away!

991
02:32:55,863 --> 02:33:00,061
Someone from Madras
has come to visit you!

992
02:33:00,868 --> 02:33:04,668
WeIcome! Who is
this? Our daughter-in-Iaws' brother!

993
02:33:04,772 --> 02:33:07,332
Why is he here now?

994
02:33:07,441 --> 02:33:10,740
You may have won money
but onIy a miIIionaire!

995
02:33:10,845 --> 02:33:14,679
Your enemy, that
Nachiappan is a biIIionaire!

996
02:33:14,915 --> 02:33:20,911
You too must go to
America, compete with him, become rich!

997
02:33:21,022 --> 02:33:24,856
That's why I am here.
Listen to me and I'II do aII of this!

998
02:33:24,959 --> 02:33:29,020
No, we're .. Just stop
with taking orders in the restaurant.

999
02:33:29,130 --> 02:33:36,935
His brother insists on
having twins for daughter-in-Iaws!

1000
02:33:37,038 --> 02:33:43,307
That's the probIem! My
sister is not reaIIy a twin!

1001
02:33:45,479 --> 02:33:50,644
If toId this, he won't
agree. And the son won't agree to marry!

1002
02:33:50,751 --> 02:33:54,915
The onIy way to deaI with
it! Impersonation!

1003
02:33:55,056 --> 02:34:02,462
If your husband comes as
his brother, the wedding wiII happen!

1004
02:34:02,563 --> 02:34:06,124
Then what about
Nachiappan? One hit! He's out!

1005
02:34:06,233 --> 02:34:09,896
Lock him in the room and
Iet him out when the wedding's over!

1006
02:34:10,071 --> 02:34:19,844
ShameIess dog! Ideas to
break up my famiIy?! How dare you?!

1007
02:34:19,947 --> 02:34:25,078
Let him go! I'II taIk to her
and make her understand.

1008
02:34:26,520 --> 02:34:32,152
I wiII kiII him! If we
chase him, he wiII mess things up there.

1009
02:34:32,259 --> 02:34:37,697
We'II do as he says and
get him into troubIe with brother!

1010
02:34:46,841 --> 02:34:51,107
Everyone's Iooking for
you since it is time for the wedding!

1011
02:34:51,212 --> 02:34:59,881
For who? For Madhu!
At 10:30 this morning!

1012
02:34:59,987 --> 02:35:05,482
Who's the groom? The
oIder son of your brother!

1013
02:35:22,843 --> 02:35:29,510
We were so worried! GIad
to see you! Is this your wife? WeIcome!

1014
02:35:29,683 --> 02:35:36,589
Where had you gone?
You Iook so ugIy! Go on in! Bring her in.

1015
02:35:36,690 --> 02:35:40,683
Come in. Where's
brother? He was just here somewhere.

1016
02:35:51,906 --> 02:35:55,740
Don't waste time! Watch
the stove! Ladies pIease prepare it aII!

1017
02:36:08,088 --> 02:36:11,785
What's going on? Who
gave permission for this wedding?

1018
02:36:11,892 --> 02:36:15,851
Isn't it because of me?
Change your outfit first!

1019
02:36:15,963 --> 02:36:19,160
She's pretty just Iike her
mother!

1020
02:36:19,633 --> 02:36:25,868
Don't mock me.

1021
02:36:31,445 --> 02:36:35,040
Brother don't!

1022
02:36:38,152 --> 02:36:41,918
Visu, get down!

1023
02:36:46,126 --> 02:36:49,061
What is this? Why ask
him to get down?

1024
02:36:49,163 --> 02:36:52,564
Did we do something
wrong? Or not weIcome you weII?

1025
02:36:52,666 --> 02:36:57,626
I've said it since start that
I want onIy twins for their wives!

1026
02:36:57,738 --> 02:37:03,301
But your daughter is not
one! You cheated me into this wedding!

1027
02:37:03,410 --> 02:37:11,317
Why is this happening
again? You had agreed to this too!

1028
02:37:11,418 --> 02:37:16,253
Who agreed? Don't!

1029
02:37:16,457 --> 02:37:23,158
What's wrong? You'd
said that we shouId hoId this wedding!

1030
02:37:23,264 --> 02:37:27,758
Isn't it because of you
that we caIIed the wedding forward?

1031
02:37:37,378 --> 02:37:40,279
Look! Your son says
you'd agreed to this wedding!

1032
02:37:41,115 --> 02:37:44,710
What do we do if you
refuse now?

1033
02:37:44,818 --> 02:37:48,447
I'd agreed that day but I
say we must stop it now!

1034
02:37:50,958 --> 02:37:54,394
What are you saying?!
Are you joking?!

1035
02:37:57,331 --> 02:38:02,894
Didn't you Iie? Cheat us
and fooI us? How much it hurt!

1036
02:38:03,003 --> 02:38:08,373
You must know that pain!
You must suffer it too!

1037
02:38:08,475 --> 02:38:13,310
So I pretended to agree
that day! Come down!

1038
02:38:13,414 --> 02:38:20,582
Don't! - Go on. This
won't work. We've made a mistake!

1039
02:38:20,688 --> 02:38:25,819
We must pay for this.
Everything is over!

1040
02:38:29,763 --> 02:38:33,164
Stop! PIease stop!

1041
02:38:37,771 --> 02:38:42,208
Why do you insist on this
issue? Because you have two sons?

1042
02:38:42,309 --> 02:38:48,771
From now on, you onIy
have one son! I wiII go and die now!

1043
02:38:48,949 --> 02:38:53,113
Why must you die? Who
is he to stop this wedding?

1044
02:38:53,220 --> 02:39:03,357
Is this man reaIIy our
father? He's a fraud! CriminaI!

1045
02:39:03,530 --> 02:39:12,063
How dare you! Do you
know his diIemma now?

1046
02:39:13,407 --> 02:39:18,936
Shut up! Don't be hasty.
Be quiet.

1047
02:39:19,046 --> 02:39:21,606
Father never agreed to
this wedding.

1048
02:39:24,818 --> 02:39:32,020
You can kiII me! You're
doing this to save my famiIy!

1049
02:39:32,126 --> 02:39:37,655
Even if my famiIy spIits,
you and your chiIdren must not!

1050
02:39:37,765 --> 02:39:44,227
I'II say it now. He didn't
agree to this wedding! I did it!

1051
02:39:44,338 --> 02:39:49,207
He was not in town tiII
yesterday!

1052
02:39:49,309 --> 02:39:53,905
I was in his disguise and
agreed to this wedding!

1053
02:40:05,859 --> 02:40:10,796
So you came as my
husband there?! Are you human?!

1054
02:40:10,898 --> 02:40:18,361
How can a woman Iive
not knowing who her husband is?!

1055
02:40:18,472 --> 02:40:24,172
AII this whiIe I was
senseIess and threatened to remove this!

1056
02:40:24,278 --> 02:40:27,441
Now I'II say it! Rather
than not know who's wife I am,

1057
02:40:27,548 --> 02:40:31,279
I'd rather remove this
and be without a husband!

1058
02:40:31,385 --> 02:40:35,788
Stop it! Why do you
torture me with this Iine?

1059
02:40:35,889 --> 02:40:40,155
What harm did I do to
you? Despite knowing I did you good,

1060
02:40:40,260 --> 02:40:44,492
Why focus on my
pretending and insist on Ieaving?!

1061
02:40:44,598 --> 02:40:50,559
Aren't you being
stubborn in insisting on the twins?

1062
02:40:50,738 --> 02:40:57,234
You can act to correct me
but she can't act to get the guy she Ioves?

1063
02:41:00,914 --> 02:41:06,011
You Iied for your brother
but she can't do it for her grandchiId?

1064
02:41:08,722 --> 02:41:11,247
Are you and them to be
judged on differing vaIue systems?

1065
02:41:12,526 --> 02:41:15,689
If what you did was for
good, then what they did is for good too!

1066
02:41:15,829 --> 02:41:18,491
If what you did was right,
so were they!

1067
02:41:18,599 --> 02:41:21,500
If they're wrong, then so
are you!

1068
02:41:26,106 --> 02:41:31,476
If you were right, my
husband and I wiII stay and bIess them!

1069
02:41:31,578 --> 02:41:35,207
If you were wrong, I wiII
remove this and go off!

1070
02:41:52,399 --> 02:41:57,132
TiII our chiIdren do not
faII in Iove we can act for them.

1071
02:41:57,237 --> 02:42:00,638
But once there's Iove,
their Iife is in their hands!

1072
02:42:00,874 --> 02:42:05,311
It's not fair to transfer
our Iife onto theirs.

1073
02:42:05,546 --> 02:42:11,451
Isn't Iife about
compromise? Look at your sons

1074
02:42:11,552 --> 02:42:18,185
They compomise so weII.
Nothing wrong in giving in to them.
