381
00:17:26,168 --> 00:17:28,503
- I have something to confess.
- What?

382
00:17:28,504 --> 00:17:30,004
So, are we keeping the rooster
or eating the rooster?

383
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:31,603
'Cause I'm not naming him
if we're eating him.

384
00:17:31,605 --> 00:17:33,906
We're eating the rooster.

385
00:17:34,643 --> 00:17:36,745
[Rooster clucks] Yes.

386
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:49,190
I love watching you eat.

387
00:17:49,191 --> 00:17:50,859
I'm rather finicky myself, but you...

388
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,694
You... you don't think about it.

389

You just... eat.

390
00:17:55,789 --> 00:17:58,700
I had a pet goat growing up... Jenny.

Aww.

392
00:17:59,802 --> 00:18:02,070
When I was 8, my parents ran out of food,

393
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:03,805
- so they made me go outside and kill her.
- Hmm?

394
00:18:03,806 --> 00:18:08,142
I had to skin Jenny,
cook Jenny, and eat Jenny.

395
00:18:08,143 --> 00:18:09,644
After that, I guess I just tried

396
00:18:09,645 --> 00:18:11,612
not to think too much
about what I was eating anymore.

397
00:18:11,613 --> 00:18:13,514
And, well...

398
00:18:13,515 --> 00:18:16,017

I wouldn't be in a position

399
00:18:16,018 --> 00:18:17,518

Too busy ruling.

403
00:18:23,892 --> 00:18:26,894
No, I had an old servant, name of Pearl.

404
00:18:26,895 --> 00:18:28,729
She served me every meal.

405
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,461
She made it fun, made a game of it.
