1
00:00:00,335 --> 00:00:01,844
<i>So here's</i>
<i>what you missed on</i> Glee:

2
00:00:01,869 --> 00:00:03,836
<i>Rachel's got the lead</i>
<i>in</i> Funny Girl <i>on Broadway,</i>

3
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:05,771
<i>and Santana doesn't know</i>
<i>what she wants to do.</i>

4
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,506
Bad Yeast goes scat
with Yeast-i-stat.

5
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:09,275
<i>The New Directions! are getting</i>
<i>ready for college...</i>

6
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:10,877
<i>Artie's going</i>
<i>to film school in Brooklyn</i>

7
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:12,478
<i>and Blaine auditioned for NYADA.</i>

8
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,113
<i>Kurt formed a band,</i>
<i>but he's afraid Starchild's</i>

9
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,348
<i>trying to steal the spotlight.</i>

10
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:16,849
<i>Which is easy</i>
<i>when you dress like</i>

11
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:17,984
<i>a glam rock Ebenezer Scrooge.</i>

12
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,285
Thank you for your time,
Starchild,

13
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:20,686
but it's not a good fit.

14
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:22,655
<i>And that's what</i>
<i>you missed on</i> Glee.

15
00:00:24,299 --> 00:00:28,236
<i>¿Perdón? Perdón?</i>

16
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,971
<i>Señorita.</i>

17
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:33,074
<i>Esos huevos no esta caliente.</i>

18
00:00:33,108 --> 00:00:34,175
Excuse me?

19
00:00:34,209 --> 00:00:35,943
Oh, you speak English.

20
00:00:35,978 --> 00:00:37,211
I thought you were Mexican.

21
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:38,779
- I'm from Ohio.
- Well, I didn't know

22
00:00:38,814 --> 00:00:40,681
there were Mexicans in Ohio.

23
00:00:40,716 --> 00:00:43,518
Okay. These eggs are cold.
I need new ones.

24
00:00:43,552 --> 00:00:45,553
(sizzling)

25
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,688
There's steam
coming off of them.

26
00:00:47,723 --> 00:00:49,924
I happen to know that
eggs carry salmonella

27
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:52,360
and I like them
cooked extra hot

28
00:00:52,394 --> 00:00:54,529
to kill any parasites.

29
00:00:54,563 --> 00:00:55,863
<i>Rápido, por favor.</i>

30
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,980
Okay, I was certain
that you were going to go

31
00:01:03,005 --> 00:01:04,805
Lima Heights Adjacent
and just throw those eggs

32
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,440
on that lady's face just now.

33
00:01:06,475 --> 00:01:07,642
No.

34
00:01:07,676 --> 00:01:08,809
I need this job.

35
00:01:08,844 --> 00:01:10,378
I'm saving up to buy a noose

36
00:01:10,412 --> 00:01:11,546
to hang myself with.

37
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,747
Hey.

38
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,181
Wait, what's going on?
Talk to me.

39
00:01:14,216 --> 00:01:16,417
It's not what I expected,
you know? I'm awesome.

40
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,753
I thought I'd come here and
everyone would see that, too.

41
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,821
Wait, what do you mean?
You got a national commercial

42
00:01:20,856 --> 00:01:22,423
within like a month
of being here.

43
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,892
Yes, and now everywhere I go,
I am known as the girl

44
00:01:24,927 --> 00:01:26,460
with the raging yeast infection.

45
00:01:26,495 --> 00:01:29,196
The other day some customers
made me take their toast back

46
00:01:29,231 --> 00:01:31,365
because looking at me made them
lose their appetite

47
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,000
for any bread products.

48
00:01:33,035 --> 00:01:35,269
I'm sorry I'm complaining.
I'm fine.

49
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:37,264
No, you're not. Look, it's
okay to complain to me,

50
00:01:37,272 --> 00:01:38,773
It means we're friends.

51
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,142
I just have this weird guilt trip
thing about being friends with you,

52
00:01:41,176 --> 00:01:43,277
because I was so awful
to you in high school.

53
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:45,580
Quinn and Brit hated you, too,
and that's mostly

54
00:01:45,614 --> 00:01:47,815
just because you sucked so bad
and you walked with that weird

55
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:49,717
"feet pointing out" thing.

56
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:51,419
I made Quinn
look like the boss,

57
00:01:51,453 --> 00:01:53,387
but I was really running
the "Hate on Rachel" parade.

58
00:01:53,422 --> 00:01:55,022
It's fine, okay?

59
00:01:55,057 --> 00:01:57,425
I forgive you, and you just
have to forgive yourself.

60
00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:00,061
High school's over and it's just
me, you and Kurt here now.

61
00:02:00,095 --> 00:02:01,929
Yes, and out of all three
of us, I am crapping

62
00:02:01,964 --> 00:02:04,131
the bed the hardest.

63
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,101
I may be on top right now,
but one day it'll be you.

64
00:02:07,135 --> 00:02:09,737
You know, what you need right
now is some good old pampering.

65
00:02:09,771 --> 00:02:11,973
Oh, are you treating at
the Korean spa? Better.

66
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,842
I'm gonna be on the cover
of <i>New York</i> magazine.

67
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:15,943
Oh, my God.
(squeals)

68
00:02:15,978 --> 00:02:17,178
Oh, my God, that's awesome.

69
00:02:17,212 --> 00:02:18,613
I'm totally pretending
not to be jealous.

70
00:02:18,647 --> 00:02:20,147
No, I'm just kidding,
that's really cool.

71
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,383
Well, it's just something that
the publicist for the show

72
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:24,986
set up to, like, introduce me
to the world and I just,

73
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,555
I feel like this is my moment
where I've really arrived.

74
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:29,323
I'm really, really
happy for you.

75
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,592
But what does this have to
do with me being pampered?

76
00:02:31,627 --> 00:02:33,628
Okay, so there's gonna be
models at the shoot and I think

77
00:02:33,662 --> 00:02:35,863
I have enough juice to ask
if you can be one of them.

78
00:02:35,897 --> 00:02:37,765
And you can get, like, get
your hair done and your nails

79
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:40,334
and your makeup and there's all
these free clothes. Are you in?

80
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:41,335
(bell dings)

81
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,703
- Hells yes, I'm in.
- Yay.

82
00:02:42,738 --> 00:02:45,573
Right after I spit...

83
00:02:45,607 --> 00:02:47,441
in these eggs.

84
00:02:48,477 --> 00:02:49,677
Heisten.

85
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,979
I really hope that I
can be as cool as you

86
00:02:52,014 --> 00:02:53,948
when the roles are reversed.

87
00:02:53,982 --> 00:02:55,449
You're a really good friend.

(school bell rings)

90
00:03:02,491 --> 00:03:04,025
I'm really proud of us.

91
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,826
- Why's that? - 'Cause
even after you and I

92
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:08,229
broke up, we were
able to stay friends

93
00:03:08,263 --> 00:03:10,398
and continue our tradition
of Tuesday lunch together.

94
00:03:10,432 --> 00:03:13,934
It's also a good way to avoid
the cafeteria on Taco Tuesdays

95
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:16,804
when they use Grade "D" prison
meat that can legally contain

96
00:03:16,838 --> 00:03:18,406
up to 5% insect larvae.

97
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,707
Still.

98
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,176
I'm gonna miss this next
year when you're at Brown

99
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,979
and I'm at film school
in Brooklyn.

100
00:03:27,315 --> 00:03:29,483
I got wait-listed at Brown.

101
00:03:29,518 --> 00:03:31,652
Oh, you'll get in. You
know how many students

102
00:03:31,687 --> 00:03:33,120
make it off the wait list?

103
00:03:33,155 --> 00:03:34,388
Two percent.

104
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,957
The only other schools I
applied to were Ohio State

105
00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:38,826
and that dumb vet school.

106
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,362
I really wanted to get out
of this place, you know?

107
00:03:41,396 --> 00:03:43,731
Expand my horizons.

108
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,700
I don't think that's
in the cards for me now.

109
00:03:45,734 --> 00:03:46,901
Well, listen.

110
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,236
We have, what, a couple
more Tuesdays at McKinley?

111
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,072
<i>Let's make them count.</i>

112
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,673
<i>From now until graduation,</i>

113
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,876
<i>Tuesday lunch is about music</i>
<i>that'll cheer you up</i>

114
00:03:55,911 --> 00:03:57,278
because the only thing
you'll be doing next year

115
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,747
is knitting scarves for those
chilly Ivy League winters.

116
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,450
That's a really
flimsy segue, Artie.

Close the door
when you sing crap like that.

00:05:55,797 --> 00:05:57,865
Hey, Becky, can we
help you with something?

152
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,867
Yeah, quit staring at my boobs.

153
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,002
Tina, Artie...
Principal Sylvester

154
00:06:02,037 --> 00:06:04,205
wants to see you in her office.

155
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:07,241
(school bell rings)

156
00:06:07,275 --> 00:06:08,442
Stumbles.

157
00:06:08,476 --> 00:06:10,477
Tina Warrior Princess.

158
00:06:10,512 --> 00:06:12,112
Graduation is fast approaching

159
00:06:12,147 --> 00:06:13,781
and it is time
to award the title

160
00:06:13,815 --> 00:06:16,884
of Senior class valedictorian.

161
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,453
Now, as you are,
respectively, a loner Asian

162
00:06:19,487 --> 00:06:21,088
who has trouble making friends

163
00:06:21,122 --> 00:06:22,756
and a nasal,
Muppety disabled kid

164
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:25,292
in a wheelchair, it should
come as no surprise

165
00:06:25,327 --> 00:06:27,862
to you both that you're
at the head of your class.

166
00:06:27,896 --> 00:06:29,597
In fact...

167
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,931
you're tied for number one.

168
00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:32,299
Tied? How is that possible?

169
00:06:32,334 --> 00:06:33,968
Identical GPAs,

170
00:06:34,002 --> 00:06:35,202
extracurriculars,

171
00:06:35,237 --> 00:06:37,438
and you both have
perfect attendance.

172
00:06:37,472 --> 00:06:40,608
Now, unlike some members
of the Glee Club who come and go

173
00:06:40,642 --> 00:06:42,743
for months at a time
with no explanation,

174
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:46,647
you two losers are
always in that choir room.

175
00:06:46,681 --> 00:06:49,116
Even if, for an entire week,
the only thing you have to do

176
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,751
is say something
inconsequential, like,

177
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:51,952
"Kitty's right,"

178
00:06:51,987 --> 00:06:54,154
or "Blaine,
are you serious?"

179
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:56,323
Wait, we can't both
be valedictorian.

180
00:06:56,358 --> 00:06:57,591
Not in my world.

181
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,793
And that is why we're
going to settle this

182
00:06:59,828 --> 00:07:02,029
with a friendly
little competition.

183
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:05,399
As you know, the valedictorian

184
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:07,434
gives the speech at graduation.

185
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,169
At the end of this week,

186
00:07:09,204 --> 00:07:12,039
you will both
deliver your speeches

187
00:07:12,073 --> 00:07:15,542
to a blue ribbon panel
of idiots of my choosing.

188
00:07:15,577 --> 00:07:16,710
Whoever wins...

189
00:07:16,745 --> 00:07:18,445
will be crowned valedictorian.

190
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,914
That sound fair?

191
00:07:19,948 --> 00:07:21,181
No, actually, it doesn't.

192
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:23,517
Life isn't fair, Abrams.

193
00:07:23,551 --> 00:07:25,119
Good, then it's settled.

194
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,855
Oh, and, uh, let this stand
as a warning to you both.

195
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:29,957
If during one of your speeches,

196
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,860
you decide to abandon
your prepared text

197
00:07:32,894 --> 00:07:35,296
in favor of a musical number,
because the emotions

198
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,197
you're feeling
are just so complex

199
00:07:37,232 --> 00:07:39,066
they can only
be expressed in song,

200
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,936
I promise you I will dedicate
my life to making sure

201
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:45,005
that every beverage you drink,
until the day you die,

202
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,507
will have a just a...

203
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:49,009
tiny, little bit
of my pee in it.

204
00:07:49,044 --> 00:07:50,544
(school bell rings)

205
00:07:50,578 --> 00:07:53,447
Oh, my God, can you believe
all the amazing dresses

206
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:54,815
that they pulled
for this shoot?

207
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,717
And all these girls
are like the new up-and-comers

208
00:07:56,751 --> 00:07:58,218
from Juilliard and Harvard and Yale.
Mm-hmm.

209
00:07:58,253 --> 00:08:00,220
Okay, that girl over there... look,
but don't really look... Oh.

210
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,789
She just got the lead
on AMC's new show

211
00:08:01,823 --> 00:08:03,223
about Victorian prostitutes.

212
00:08:03,258 --> 00:08:05,092
I'm so nervous, but I'm nervous
because I'm excited

213
00:08:05,126 --> 00:08:07,161
or because I'm scared, this is so amazing.
Berry, Berry.

214
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,295
You look amazing.
Okay.

215
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,563
Own it.
All right.

216
00:08:09,597 --> 00:08:11,231
You are exactly where
you're supposed to be.

217
00:08:11,266 --> 00:08:12,433
- Thank you.
- Okay, good luck.

218
00:08:12,467 --> 00:08:13,567
Okay, here I go.

219
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:15,235
- Tell me if I look good.
- Okay. (laughs)

Come on.

267
00:10:37,312 --> 00:10:38,879
Go to wardrobe, get dressed.

268
00:10:40,548 --> 00:10:42,216
Okay.

269
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,684
(school bell rings)

270
00:10:43,718 --> 00:10:45,752
No need to write a speech.
I wrote it for you.

271
00:10:45,787 --> 00:10:48,021
"In the hallowed halls
of McKinley High,

272
00:10:48,056 --> 00:10:51,558
"one name rises to the top:
Tina Cohen-Chang.

273
00:10:51,593 --> 00:10:53,894
"There is no other choice
for valedictorian.

274
00:10:53,928 --> 00:10:55,762
I humbly drop out."

275
00:10:55,797 --> 00:10:57,030
<i>No me gusta.</i>

276
00:10:57,065 --> 00:10:58,999
Artie, I need valedictorian

277
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,634
in order to guarantee
my acceptance to Brown.

278
00:11:00,668 --> 00:11:01,868
If I don't get in, I'm screwed.

279
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,303
Please take the fall for me.

280
00:11:03,338 --> 00:11:05,506
No. It's not my fault you didn't
apply to enough schools.

281
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,175
Maybe I was too busy making
costumes and building sets

282
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,043
and swaying in the background
while everybody else

283
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:11,545
was front and center.
You always get

284
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:13,714
everything you want,
and I get nothing.

285
00:11:13,748 --> 00:11:16,150
Woman, are you insane?
You just won Prom Queen.

286
00:11:16,184 --> 00:11:17,451
Which counts against me.

287
00:11:17,485 --> 00:11:19,052
I read online
that college admission directors

288
00:11:19,087 --> 00:11:20,521
think that high school
Prom Queens

289
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,055
are self-centered
attention whores.

290
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,223
Exactly.

291
00:11:23,258 --> 00:11:24,458
Excuse me?

292
00:11:25,493 --> 00:11:26,860
It's time you heard this.

293
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,228
The whole school's
been talking about it.

294
00:11:28,263 --> 00:11:30,898
Everyone's convinced
that sometime between junior

295
00:11:30,932 --> 00:11:32,833
and senior year,
an alien invaded your body

296
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:34,234
and made you shallow
and desperate.

297
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:36,036
Says the nerd
who's dating a Cheerio!

298
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,705
Says the hag
who vapo-raped Blaine.

299
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,440
That was blown totally out
of proportion, and, yeah,

300
00:11:40,475 --> 00:11:42,442
I had a little crush on a guy
who could never love me,

301
00:11:42,477 --> 00:11:43,777
but is that any different

302
00:11:43,811 --> 00:11:45,712
than you having a crush
on a girl who can't possibly

303
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:46,613
love you?

304
00:11:46,648 --> 00:11:48,015
Kitty does love me.

305
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:50,017
Please.
She's obviously using you

306
00:11:50,051 --> 00:11:52,486
for some kind
of sick charity project,

307
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,421
and you're using her, too.

308
00:11:54,455 --> 00:11:56,023
That's what your speech
can be about,

309
00:11:56,057 --> 00:11:59,026
how you're making a sad,
last-ditch effort to be popular

310
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,361
by dating
McKinley's biggest bitch.

311
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,865
Actually, Tina,
you're McKinley's biggest bitch.

312
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:06,233
And I'm gonna win this.

313
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:16,446
I don't know, Kurt, don't you
think you might be overreacting?

314
00:12:16,471 --> 00:12:18,438
If anything, I'm underreacting.

315
00:12:18,473 --> 00:12:20,707
Starchild is trying
to take over the band.

316
00:12:20,742 --> 00:12:23,376
The soul of Pamela Lansbury
is hanging in the balance.

317
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:25,178
It all started when Elliott
scored an interview

318
00:12:25,213 --> 00:12:27,514
in <i>The Village Voice,</i>
and he said,

319
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:29,649
"I feel so alive right now.

320
00:12:29,684 --> 00:12:31,651
Nothing means more to me
than my band."

321
00:12:31,686 --> 00:12:35,255
That's great, isn't it? He's
calling it <i>his</i> band, Blaine.

322
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:37,657
And then, not five minutes ago,
do I get a text from him

323
00:12:37,692 --> 00:12:39,126
that says, "Oh, my God,

324
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,328
I just wrote a new song
that we have"... in all caps...

325
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:44,931
"got to do."
I mean, he's a psychopath.

326
00:12:44,966 --> 00:12:47,134
Kurt, I gotta go. But, look,
if you're really concerned

327
00:12:47,168 --> 00:12:49,536
about Elliot, don't let on,
even for a second.

328
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,738
Remember the old adage,
keep your friends close

329
00:12:51,773 --> 00:12:53,073
and your enemies closer.

330
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:54,808
I love you.

331
00:12:56,711 --> 00:12:59,813
All right, ladies, remember,
we got band rehearsal tonight.

332
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:02,415
Kurt, I'm sorry,
I just... I can't.

333
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,917
- What?
- Wait, what? Why?

334
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:06,052
Santana, don't start
with me right now.

335
00:13:06,087 --> 00:13:07,754
They're auditioning
my understudy today,

336
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:10,590
and I have to be there.
I told them it's ridiculous

337
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,859
because it's not like I'm ever
gonna miss a performance

338
00:13:12,894 --> 00:13:15,662
or anything. Just... It must be
an insurance thing, right?

339
00:13:15,696 --> 00:13:18,498
Hey, well, hold up. If Berry's
not coming, then neither am I.

340
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:20,901
Guys, we're in a band.
We have to practice.

341
00:13:20,935 --> 00:13:22,736
Kurt, I would think
that you would understand

342
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,738
all the emotional stress
that I'm under right now,

343
00:13:24,772 --> 00:13:27,407
and I need you guys to just
be a little supportive.

344
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:31,978
It's just...
it's really hard being a star.

345
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,884
Okay, guys, it's coming down
to the wire.

346
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,686
We have a very important
decision to make.

347
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,522
Yes, my wig is either gonna be
Anna Wintour chic

348
00:13:42,557 --> 00:13:43,723
or Pam Grier fabulousness.

349
00:13:43,758 --> 00:13:45,492
I'm not ready
to make the decision.

350
00:13:45,526 --> 00:13:48,395
Okay. So, we have two solos
at nationals.

351
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:50,096
And since Blaine
was voted the new Rachel,

352
00:13:50,131 --> 00:13:52,098
obviously he's got one.
So...

353
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:53,967
who is gonna step up
and take center stage?

354
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:56,036
I'd like to nominate myself.

355
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,704
Shocker.
And you think you're gonna

356
00:13:57,738 --> 00:13:59,606
carry us to victory?
Actually, Mr. Shue,

357
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,708
I think I'd like to compete
with Tina for that second spot.

358
00:14:01,742 --> 00:14:04,544
Well, I think we should have a
sing-off, right here, right now.

359
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:05,679

I didn't mean to.

00:16:17,745 --> 00:16:20,046
There, buddy.
It's fine.

409
00:16:20,081 --> 00:16:22,082
I'm fine.

00:16:23,084 --> 00:16:24,884

When the girls bailed,
I almost canceled rehearsal,

413
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:32,959
but then I thought, why can't
it just be the boys today?

414
00:16:32,994 --> 00:16:35,295
Why not use this
as a great opportunity

415
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,430
to get to know
my new friend Elliott?

416
00:16:37,465 --> 00:16:39,933
- Cucumber sandwich?
- Thank you. Yeah.

417
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:43,069
So, let's break it down,
Andy Cohen-style.

418
00:16:43,104 --> 00:16:45,705
How long have you been
performing?

419
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,874
'Cause you are
extremely confident

420
00:16:47,908 --> 00:16:49,409
out there on that stage.

421
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:51,611
Like you've been doing it
your whole life.

422
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:54,080
A-And dare I say it? You just
might be the breakout star

423
00:16:54,115 --> 00:16:55,081
of Pamela Lansbury.

424
00:16:55,116 --> 00:16:56,583
(distorted):
Yeah, well, I am.

425
00:16:56,617 --> 00:16:58,151
Sorry?

426
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:59,719
Come on now. I mean...
(stammers)

427
00:16:59,754 --> 00:17:01,654
everybody's bringing
something essential to the mix.

428
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:04,491
Right, right. Said Beyoncé right
before she left Destiny's Child.

429
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:07,060
She was better...
But you were saying something.

430
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:09,896
Um, yeah, I guess the first time
onstage was... fifth grade.

431
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,165
I played Schroeder in <i>You're</i>
<i>a Good Man, Charlie Brown.</i>

432
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,667
How does one go
from Schroeder to Starchild?

433
00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:17,070
What is that journey like?
Well...

434
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:20,507
Ruthless and-and full of
ambition, I-I, I imagine...

435
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,442
qualities that I admire,
of course, and, you know,

436
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:24,177
wish I had more of myself.

437
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:27,313
Um, I started with, um,
singing lessons and piano.

438
00:17:27,348 --> 00:17:29,282
And-and I just started
taking guitar.

439
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:31,885
Would you teach me?
Have you ever played?

440
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,788
Oh, yeah, a little. I-I think
I know the-the basic chords,

441
00:17:34,822 --> 00:17:37,791
but I'm nowhere near your level
of virtuosity.

442
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:40,894
I'm not that good. Oh, will you
stop downplaying yourself?

443
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:44,898
You... are amazing.

444
00:17:44,932 --> 00:17:47,567
You could easily be
the front man of our band

445
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:48,835
if you wanted to be. Do you?

446
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:50,303
(distorted):
Yes.

447
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:52,072
Come again?

448
00:17:52,106 --> 00:17:55,475
You know, Kurt, uh,
if you really want to learn,

449
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:57,143
you should... you should get
your own guitar.

450
00:17:57,178 --> 00:17:59,879
You know, something
that suits your personality

451
00:17:59,914 --> 00:18:02,215
and your style. You know,
having the right instrument

452
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:03,650
makes a huge difference.

453
00:18:03,684 --> 00:18:05,752

hired me for this part.

461

No one can sing in this town.

462
00:18:24,905 --> 00:18:28,208

because you are spectacular.

463
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:29,709
And incredibly healthy.

464
00:18:29,743 --> 00:18:31,344

that Chinese people wear
once we're up and running

466
00:18:32,913 --> 00:18:34,247
because I do not get sick,

467
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:35,982
which is why I don't
need an understudy.

468
00:18:36,016 --> 00:18:37,650
The union says
you need an understudy.

469
00:18:37,685 --> 00:18:40,453
So does the producer, so does
our insurance company, so do I.

470
00:18:40,488 --> 00:18:42,722
Fine. How many more

Well, actually, I heard
about this audition

523
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:37,630
from Rachel.

524
00:21:37,665 --> 00:21:39,165
We're roommates, and we went
to high school together.

525
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:41,401

both of you?

526
00:21:41,435 --> 00:21:43,169
Rachel, why didn't you
tell me about her?

527
00:21:45,005 --> 00:21:47,006
Uh...

528
00:21:52,496 --> 00:21:54,864
Ooh, I'm so excited that
we're doing this, Elliott.

529
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:56,999
And after this, I thought
we could second-act <i>Pippin.</i>

530
00:21:57,034 --> 00:21:58,868
Ooh. And we can go to Angus's
for after-theater cocktails.

00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:01,237
Oh, yeah. Looking for
anything in particular?

00:22:01,271 --> 00:22:03,706
Uh, yeah. My friend's in
the market for a new guitar.

No, that song is
Ms. Streisand's

591
00:25:02,552 --> 00:25:03,919
as long as she's on this planet.

592
00:25:03,954 --> 00:25:05,488
But let me tell you
something... when she goes,

593
00:25:05,522 --> 00:25:07,490
it's gonna be my responsibility
to sing it.

594
00:25:07,524 --> 00:25:08,858
Do you know how insane
you sound?

595
00:25:08,892 --> 00:25:10,993
It was completely
inappropriate of her

596
00:25:11,027 --> 00:25:12,187
to try out without telling me.

597
00:25:12,195 --> 00:25:15,397
Hey, roomies.
Talking about me?

598
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:16,592
No. Why would you think that?

599
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,733
Why did you audition
without telling me?

600
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:19,935
Well, because I figured

601
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:22,238
that we were going
to fight about it, anyway,

602
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:23,772
so we might as well
go at it afterwards.

603
00:25:23,807 --> 00:25:25,508
That way you don't have
a chance to torpedo me.

604
00:25:25,542 --> 00:25:28,577
Fanny Brice is a New York Jew.
You playing that role is

605
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:30,813
like me being the grand marshal
at the Puerto Rican Day parade.

606
00:25:30,847 --> 00:25:32,181
What if you weren't
playing Fanny?

607
00:25:32,215 --> 00:25:34,650
If you weren't playing the lead,
and I came home and said

608
00:25:34,684 --> 00:25:36,364
that I had auditioned
to be the understudy,

609
00:25:36,386 --> 00:25:37,720
would you still feel
so strongly?

610
00:25:37,754 --> 00:25:40,222
I'm arguing on principle.
This is not personal.

611
00:25:40,257 --> 00:25:41,557
Bull crap, Rachel.

612
00:25:41,591 --> 00:25:44,093
You have all of this talk about
forgiveness for high school,

613
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:46,195
but the reality is
that you just love having

614
00:25:46,229 --> 00:25:47,796
something over me.
I mean, these past

615
00:25:47,831 --> 00:25:49,331
couple of months
with you in rehearsal

616
00:25:49,366 --> 00:25:53,035
and me waiting tables has been
such sweet revenge for you.

617
00:25:53,069 --> 00:25:56,105
And you just can't stand the
idea that I might get mine, too.

618
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:58,474
I just got you on the cover
of <i>New York</i> magazine!

619
00:25:58,508 --> 00:26:00,776
In the background. You were
practically glowing about it.

620
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,444
That's because
I accomplished something.

621
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:03,879
It had nothing to do with you.

622
00:26:03,914 --> 00:26:06,582
No, see, it actually has
everything to do with me.

623
00:26:06,616 --> 00:26:08,984
Every step that you take
in this city is fueled

624
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:11,353
by all of the hate
that we gave you.

625
00:26:11,388 --> 00:26:14,156
All of that ambition is just
you trying to prove us wrong.

626
00:26:14,191 --> 00:26:15,958
Which is fine, Rachel.
I mean, whatever works for you.

627
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:17,526
Just don't try
to say that it isn't.

628
00:26:17,561 --> 00:26:19,094
You know what? Why don't we just
chill for a second, please.

629
00:26:19,129 --> 00:26:20,896
Okay, I'll make espresso.
You know what?

630
00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:22,198
You can't handle it.

631
00:26:22,232 --> 00:26:24,166
You can't handle
that I have made it,

632
00:26:24,201 --> 00:26:26,735
and you are just begging
to be my understudy.

633
00:26:27,771 --> 00:26:29,972
Okay, you know what?

634
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:32,374
Just admit that even with all
of your years of singing lessons

635
00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:35,878
and dancing lessons and
only-child adoration

636
00:26:35,912 --> 00:26:37,479
from your gay
Broadway dads that I

637
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:39,448
am just as good as you.

638
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:42,151
Unlike you, I can be popular
in high school and still

639
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:43,419
make it big after graduation.

640
00:26:43,453 --> 00:26:45,621
Just admit that no matter
what you do,

641
00:26:45,655 --> 00:26:47,189
or how far you go,

642
00:26:47,224 --> 00:26:48,958
you will never be able
to scratch that itch.

643
00:26:48,992 --> 00:26:52,061
You will never be able to look
down on me and redeem yourself.

644
00:26:52,095 --> 00:26:53,696
Because I was better
than you then,

645
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,364
and I'm always gonna
be better than you.

646
00:26:55,398 --> 00:26:57,299
You are short,
you are awful, and

647
00:26:57,334 --> 00:26:58,667
that is never going to change.

My fellow graduates,

I feel like I was
a different person

672
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:27,122
when I first arrived at McKinley
High School four years ago.

673
00:28:27,157 --> 00:28:29,224
I was a goth chick

674
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:32,394
who was so intent
on pushing people away

675
00:28:32,429 --> 00:28:34,630
that I pretended
to have a stutter,

676
00:28:34,664 --> 00:28:37,800
which I now understand
wasn't even that convincing.

in my life changed.

00:29:09,265 --> 00:29:11,200
but he's an inspiration to
high school students everywhere.

689
00:29:11,234 --> 00:29:13,235
ARTIE: <i>Sure, I've
experienced adversity.</i>

690
00:29:13,269 --> 00:29:15,404
One Christmas, I was given
a pair of mechanical legs

691
00:29:15,438 --> 00:29:17,739
that allowed me to walk for an
hour before they promptly broke.

692
00:29:17,774 --> 00:29:20,008
But I've never been so humbled
as I was

693
00:29:20,043 --> 00:29:22,544
the moment Tina Cohen-Chang
wiped the slushie off

694
00:29:22,579 --> 00:29:24,880
of her gown and triumphantly
returned to the stage

695
00:29:24,914 --> 00:29:26,882
to claim her rightful crown
as prom queen.

696
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:28,984
That is why I respectfully

697
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:30,385
withdraw myself
from consideration,

698
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,354
and ask that Tina be named
this year's valedictorian.

699
00:29:32,388 --> 00:29:35,357
I believe he should be given the
title of class valedictorian.

700
00:29:35,391 --> 00:29:37,059
(sniffling)
God, this can't be happening.

701
00:29:37,093 --> 00:29:38,360
TINA:
Is it a bridge too far

702
00:29:38,394 --> 00:29:40,662
to call Artie Abrams
an American hero?

703
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:42,130
I think not.

704
00:29:42,165 --> 00:29:44,399
ARTIE:
<i>It's no exaggeration to say</i>

705
00:29:44,434 --> 00:29:45,801
that Tina took my broken body
in her arms

706
00:29:45,835 --> 00:29:47,169
and taught me how to love.

707
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:49,905
And as he strains to push
his wheelchair up that ramp,

708
00:29:49,939 --> 00:29:52,741
the ghosts of fallen heroes
follow close behind.

709
00:29:52,775 --> 00:29:55,978
Rosa Parks, Mahatma Gandhi.

710
00:29:56,012 --> 00:29:59,248
Artie Abrams holds high
the torch of dignity.

711
00:29:59,282 --> 00:30:02,518
So please, respected judges,
cast your lot for Tina.

712
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:05,120
I beseech you, vote for Artie.

713
00:30:05,154 --> 00:30:08,891
Tina Cohen-Chang, teammate,
sometime lover,

714
00:30:08,925 --> 00:30:11,159
patriot, friend.

715
00:30:11,194 --> 00:30:13,228
Thank you.

716
00:30:13,263 --> 00:30:14,396
Thank you.

717
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,631
What a treacly, stomach-turning

718
00:30:15,665 --> 00:30:18,433
waste of everybody's time.

719
00:30:18,468 --> 00:30:20,002
I hate you both.

720
00:30:20,036 --> 00:30:22,671
The judges will now make
their decision

721
00:30:22,705 --> 00:30:24,673
while I find a
wastebasket to dry-heave

722
00:30:24,707 --> 00:30:27,809
mouthfuls of yellow bile into.

723
00:30:41,991 --> 00:30:43,458
What are you doing?

724
00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:44,793
Putting makeup on.

725
00:30:44,827 --> 00:30:46,228
I have some bruising on my cheek

726
00:30:46,262 --> 00:30:47,742
I'd like to cover up
before rehearsal.

727
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:49,565
You may not know this because
you haven't been interested

728
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:50,899
in Broadway
since the day we met,

729
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:52,367
but the star gets
her own vanity.

730
00:30:52,402 --> 00:30:53,502
There is a perfectly fine

731
00:30:53,536 --> 00:30:55,404
bathroom mirror upstairs
for the understudy.

732
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:57,606
So sorry, I totally forgot
how much room you need

733
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,841
for all that hooker makeup
you plaster on every day.

734
00:30:59,876 --> 00:31:01,343
I will totally slap you again.

735
00:31:01,377 --> 00:31:03,178
I would love for things
to get physical.

736
00:31:03,212 --> 00:31:05,147
I will hit you so hard that
you won't be able to wake up

737
00:31:05,181 --> 00:31:07,449
until you're old enough
to be <i>Funny Lady.</i>

738
00:31:07,483 --> 00:31:09,117
You will never play this part;
I know you're planning

739
00:31:09,152 --> 00:31:10,953
on getting all <i>Showgirls</i> crazy
on me and pushing me

740
00:31:10,987 --> 00:31:12,154
down the stairs
and poisoning my oatmeal,

741
00:31:12,188 --> 00:31:13,522
but you're gonna have
to kill me first,

742
00:31:13,556 --> 00:31:15,316
and even then,
I will come back from the dead

743
00:31:15,325 --> 00:31:17,526
and I will play this part
just to spite you.

744
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,527
Zombie Fanny?

745
00:31:18,561 --> 00:31:20,295
Ghost Fanny, actually.

746
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,630
What's this?

747
00:31:21,664 --> 00:31:23,532
Fighting? No, no, no.

748
00:31:23,566 --> 00:31:24,833
No way, no fighting.

749
00:31:24,867 --> 00:31:26,368
Okay, Rupert,
this isn't gonna work.

750
00:31:26,402 --> 00:31:27,936
Santana and I have a past.

751
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:30,272
Which besides her
being incredibly talented,

752
00:31:30,306 --> 00:31:31,473
is why she is here.

753
00:31:31,507 --> 00:31:33,775
If you want to fill this house,

754
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,243
we need all the press
we can get.

755
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:36,912
I've got Pat Healy
from the <i>New York Times,</i>

756
00:31:36,946 --> 00:31:38,614
David Cote from <i>Time Out,</i>

757
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:39,748
Adam Hetrick

758
00:31:39,782 --> 00:31:42,417
from playbill.com
all begging me

759
00:31:42,452 --> 00:31:44,052
to break the story
of the two girls

760
00:31:44,087 --> 00:31:45,487
from the same high school
in Ohio

761
00:31:45,521 --> 00:31:47,522
who made it big in the
same Broadway show.

762
00:31:47,557 --> 00:31:49,257
Two old friends

763
00:31:49,292 --> 00:31:53,128
finding fame, love and fortune
in the big city. Hell of a hook.

764
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:56,531
You're both gonna get plenty
of attention individually,

765
00:31:56,566 --> 00:31:59,234
but it is a fact, as a team,

766
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:01,203
you'll be twice as famous.

767
00:32:01,237 --> 00:32:03,572
From now on, I want the two
of you joined at the hip.

768
00:32:03,606 --> 00:32:05,574
You both need to know every
move Fanny makes in the show,

769
00:32:05,608 --> 00:32:06,875
starting with scene 14.

770
00:32:06,909 --> 00:32:09,444
Rachel, you'll run through
it first, then Santana.

771
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:10,519
I don't know what happened

772
00:32:10,546 --> 00:32:11,813
between the two of
you in the past.

773
00:32:11,848 --> 00:32:13,115
Honestly, I don't really care.

774
00:32:13,149 --> 00:32:15,884
It's all...
puppy dogs and rainbows

775
00:32:15,918 --> 00:32:18,487
from now till this show closes.

776
00:32:19,489 --> 00:32:21,089
(sighs heavily)

777
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:24,826
Well...

778
00:32:24,861 --> 00:32:26,428
at least we know who
the rainbow is,

779
00:32:26,462 --> 00:32:27,963
and who's the dog.

780
00:32:27,997 --> 00:32:30,098
Bathroom's upstairs!

Oh, be still my glam heart.

824
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:19,568
You know, there's this amazing
flea market in Park Slope

825
00:35:19,602 --> 00:35:20,735
- that we should go to.
- Ooh.

826
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,204
I will help you pick out

827
00:35:22,238 --> 00:35:24,372
the perfect records
to add to your collection.

828
00:35:24,407 --> 00:35:25,740
I'm, uh, kind of magic
like that.

829
00:35:25,775 --> 00:35:29,244
And I am kind of magic
at baking prepackaged goods

830
00:35:29,278 --> 00:35:30,946
with extra glazing.

831
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,380
- Aw...
- Yes!

832
00:35:32,415 --> 00:35:33,615
That looks amazing.

833
00:35:33,649 --> 00:35:35,884
(chuckles)

834
00:35:35,918 --> 00:35:37,118
You know, Kurt...

835
00:35:37,153 --> 00:35:39,221
you know, this might sound
a little bit weird,

836
00:35:39,255 --> 00:35:41,890
but, um, I'm so glad
that we've met.

837
00:35:41,924 --> 00:35:43,391
I mean,

838
00:35:43,426 --> 00:35:44,759
you're the first gay friend
that I've made

839
00:35:44,794 --> 00:35:46,127
in the city that's not crazy

840
00:35:46,162 --> 00:35:48,496
or just trying to hook up.

841
00:35:48,531 --> 00:35:50,799
But I do know what you're doing.

842
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:53,134
What's that?

843
00:35:53,169 --> 00:35:55,937
I'm not trying
to take over you band, man.

844
00:35:55,972 --> 00:35:57,672
That's what
you're thinking, right?

845
00:35:57,707 --> 00:36:00,107
I mean, that's why we've been
spending so much time together?

846
00:36:01,978 --> 00:36:03,178
You are kind of magic.

847
00:36:03,212 --> 00:36:04,746
I'm sorry,
I-I just wanted to,

848
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,847
you know, figure out,

849
00:36:05,882 --> 00:36:07,215
exactly what your deal was.

850
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,617
Well, the deal is this.

851
00:36:08,651 --> 00:36:10,952
You guys are awesome.

852
00:36:10,987 --> 00:36:12,954
You're good people,
you're talented

853
00:36:12,989 --> 00:36:14,723
and, you know what?
So am I.

854
00:36:14,757 --> 00:36:17,225
So let's not be
these, like, smiley frenemies

855
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,360
that backstab each other.

856
00:36:18,394 --> 00:36:20,662
Let's go out
and kick ass together.

857
00:36:20,696 --> 00:36:23,498
I mean, I'm a part of your band.

858
00:36:23,532 --> 00:36:26,368
Yeah, you are.

859
00:36:26,402 --> 00:36:27,369
Okay, let's document
this moment.

860
00:36:27,403 --> 00:36:28,503
Shall we? Great.
Yes, yes.

861
00:36:28,537 --> 00:36:30,417
I think this calls
for a Pamela Lansbury selfie.

862
00:36:33,276 --> 00:36:34,910
Oh! See...
I was still chewing.

863
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,444
Oh, sorry, let's take
a look, it could be...

864
00:36:36,479 --> 00:36:37,979
Yeah, no, we're doing
that again...

865
00:36:38,014 --> 00:36:39,781
Yeah, that's awful.
We're going that again, okay?

866
00:36:39,815 --> 00:36:41,549
One, two... Be super cute.

867
00:36:43,019 --> 00:36:45,086
Aw, cute!
(laughs)

868
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:47,255
(gasps) Oh!

869
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,591
(school bell ringing)

870
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,726
Well, the judges have spoken.

871
00:36:51,761 --> 00:36:53,461
And?
Congratulations, morons.

872
00:36:53,496 --> 00:36:55,096
You split the vote.
It's a tie.

873
00:36:55,131 --> 00:36:56,131
Are you serious?

874
00:36:56,165 --> 00:36:58,133
Yes, I am, Make-a-Wish.

875
00:36:58,167 --> 00:36:59,801
Now I have no choice

876
00:36:59,835 --> 00:37:01,469
but to make you
co-salutatorians.

877
00:37:01,504 --> 00:37:03,805
And elevate the student
ranked number three

878
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,140
to the class valedictorian.

879
00:37:05,174 --> 00:37:06,141
Who?

880
00:37:06,175 --> 00:37:07,642
Blaine Anderson.

881
00:37:07,677 --> 00:37:09,210
What?
What?!

882
00:37:09,245 --> 00:37:11,846
I'm really sorry, guys.
I feel terrible.

883
00:37:11,881 --> 00:37:13,648
Don't be, if we can't
be valedictorian,

884
00:37:13,683 --> 00:37:14,716
we're glad it's you.

885
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,351
No, but you two deserve it.

886
00:37:16,385 --> 00:37:18,553
I mean, come on, you guys have
a higher grade point average.

887
00:37:18,587 --> 00:37:20,221
I know this sounds
like a humble brag.

888
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,489
But honestly,
I feel like sometimes

889
00:37:21,524 --> 00:37:23,191
things just get handed to me.

890
00:37:24,226 --> 00:37:26,127
Really? Hmm.
I never noticed that.

891
00:37:26,162 --> 00:37:27,429
You know, like, how Mr. Shue

892
00:37:27,463 --> 00:37:28,797
gives me more solos
than anyone, and...

893
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:30,432
BECKY:
Blade gay Blaine!

894
00:37:30,466 --> 00:37:33,001
When did you break-up
with Pancake Face?

895
00:37:33,035 --> 00:37:34,669
Uh, Becky, I'd really
appreciate it

896
00:37:34,704 --> 00:37:38,239
if you didn't call my
fiancé "Pancake Face."

897
00:37:38,274 --> 00:37:40,241
And no, we're not broken up.

898
00:37:40,276 --> 00:37:43,011
Yeah, you are.

899
00:37:43,045 --> 00:37:45,046
(quietly):
What?

900
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:51,386
Um, that's a...
that's a great photo, Becky.

901
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,288
But don't worry.

902
00:37:53,322 --> 00:37:54,356
Kurt and Elliot are
just friends.

903
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:56,091
Just friends, my ass.

904
00:37:56,125 --> 00:37:58,893
Speaking of ass...

905
00:37:58,928 --> 00:37:59,928
Pancake Face is getting some.

906
00:37:59,962 --> 00:38:01,963
Oh, snap!

907
00:38:01,998 --> 00:38:04,299
(weak laugh)

908
00:38:08,762 --> 00:38:10,702
Tina and Artie have both
demurred from having solos

909
00:38:10,727 --> 00:38:12,294
at Nationals,
so we're still looking

910
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:13,596
for someone to step up.

911
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,631
Uh, Mr. Shue?
You already have a solo, Blaine.

912
00:38:15,665 --> 00:38:17,099
Thank you, Tina.

913
00:38:17,134 --> 00:38:19,769
This is about something else.

914
00:38:19,803 --> 00:38:21,103
As you may have all heard,

915
00:38:21,138 --> 00:38:23,105
I have been asked, oddly,

916
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,174
to be valedictorian this year.

917
00:38:25,208 --> 00:38:26,942
And so, I thought,
instead of boring everybody

918
00:38:26,977 --> 00:38:28,611
with the traditional
valedictorian speech

919
00:38:28,645 --> 00:38:30,246
where I tell people to follow
their dreams

920
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,714
and blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah,

921
00:38:31,748 --> 00:38:33,249
I could actually affect people
by singing.

922
00:38:33,283 --> 00:38:34,683
So I was hoping
you guys could help me

923
00:38:34,718 --> 00:38:36,786
brainstorm
some graduation songs.

924
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,120
I cannot wait to watch

925
00:38:38,155 --> 00:38:40,156
Principal Sylvester
assassinate you.

926
00:38:42,893 --> 00:38:45,895
Look, I know you guys
both really wanted it.

927
00:38:47,164 --> 00:38:49,165
That's why I want both
of you to sing with me.

928
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:52,268
Whatever song we pick,
we should pick together.

929
00:38:52,302 --> 00:38:53,836
And you should both
definitely have solos.

930
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:55,437
And, Tina, we could
film rehearsal

931
00:38:55,472 --> 00:38:56,605
and send it to Brown.

932
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,274
And they're so artsy
and progressive

933
00:38:58,308 --> 00:39:00,042
that I'm sure once they see it,
they're just gonna open up

934
00:39:00,076 --> 00:39:01,677
those Van Winkle gates,
looking for you.

935
00:39:01,711 --> 00:39:03,879
They better open them
really wide.

936
00:39:03,914 --> 00:39:05,281
Oh, Blainy Days.

937
00:39:05,315 --> 00:39:06,982
Well, if we're gonna go down,

938
00:39:07,017 --> 00:39:09,118
I'm honored to go
down together.

939
00:39:09,152 --> 00:39:10,653
Yes! Right! That's
that spirit I like!

940
00:39:10,687 --> 00:39:12,354
(all chatting happily)

941
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:14,056
We all can't live here anymore.

942
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,457
One of us has to go.

943
00:39:15,492 --> 00:39:16,992
I've paid rent here
for three months.

944
00:39:17,027 --> 00:39:19,495
And even though I never
actually got to have a bed,

945
00:39:19,529 --> 00:39:21,096
uh, I have squatter's rights.

946
00:39:21,131 --> 00:39:22,431
Kurt, you're the deciding vote.

947
00:39:22,465 --> 00:39:24,200
Oh, well, then I guess
I should pack my stuff now.

948
00:39:24,234 --> 00:39:25,701
'Cause we all know who he's
gonna side with. Right.

949
00:39:25,735 --> 00:39:27,403
Thank you.
I'm thinking neither of you.

950
00:39:27,437 --> 00:39:29,371
Okay? This is ridiculous!
We are friends.

951
00:39:29,406 --> 00:39:31,207
I'm not gonna let something
like this break us up.

952
00:39:31,241 --> 00:39:32,675
This is betrayal, Kurt, okay?

953
00:39:32,709 --> 00:39:34,710
This is exactly how
friends break up.

954
00:39:34,744 --> 00:39:36,779
She auditioned for
your understudy, Rachel.

955
00:39:36,813 --> 00:39:38,380
How is that betrayal?
Okay, you know what?

956
00:39:38,415 --> 00:39:40,349
Let me break it down for you...
the sole purpose

957
00:39:40,383 --> 00:39:41,817
of an understudy is to hope

958
00:39:41,852 --> 00:39:43,752
that the lead never goes on.

959
00:39:43,787 --> 00:39:45,054
She only wins if I lose!

960
00:39:45,088 --> 00:39:46,822
And I can't be around this
negative energy anymore.

961
00:39:46,857 --> 00:39:49,058
This is my big break
and she is poisoning it!

962
00:39:49,092 --> 00:39:50,593
"Poison."

963
00:39:50,627 --> 00:39:51,894
Even if she never went out
on that stage,

964
00:39:51,928 --> 00:39:53,696
this would be
a very important job for her.

965
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:54,964
And I'm a little disappointed
you can't find

966
00:39:54,998 --> 00:39:56,232
the generosity
in your heart to see that.

967
00:39:56,266 --> 00:39:57,766
You know what? If you think

968
00:39:57,801 --> 00:39:59,635
that she is just some babe

969
00:39:59,669 --> 00:40:01,170
in the woods
who is perfectly fine

970
00:40:01,204 --> 00:40:04,206
with living off of the scraps
off of my star sandwich,

971
00:40:04,241 --> 00:40:06,542
then you are naive
and willfully ignorant!

972
00:40:06,576 --> 00:40:08,244
She would kill for this part!

973
00:40:08,278 --> 00:40:09,645
Oh, yes, she has been
awful to us before.

974
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:10,813
But I believe her now.

975
00:40:10,847 --> 00:40:12,615
Look at that,
Pasty Gay is siding with me.

976
00:40:12,649 --> 00:40:13,883
I am not siding
with either of you.

977
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:15,077
I just want to order a pizza,

978
00:40:15,085 --> 00:40:16,318
sit down and talk this out!

979
00:40:16,353 --> 00:40:18,254
You know what?

980
00:40:18,288 --> 00:40:20,155
You guys can do whatever
you want in this apartment,

981
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:22,791
because I'm leaving, and let me
tell you something, Santana.

982
00:40:22,826 --> 00:40:24,927
You and I have just been
pretending to be friends

983
00:40:24,961 --> 00:40:27,229
ever since we did that
stupid number in the choir room

984
00:40:27,264 --> 00:40:29,698
after graduation,
all happy and supportive.

985
00:40:29,733 --> 00:40:30,900
But it's all crap!

986
00:40:30,934 --> 00:40:32,534
Because you and I have
never been friends.

987
00:40:32,569 --> 00:40:35,271
Never have and never will be!

988
00:40:35,305 --> 00:40:37,139
Rachel, no.

989
00:40:37,173 --> 00:40:39,441
No. No, you know what?
Let her go.

990
00:40:39,476 --> 00:40:42,878
Hey, leave the mattress though,
would you?

991
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,314
I am on the cusp

992
00:40:45,348 --> 00:40:47,483
of something that most people
never even touch,

993
00:40:47,517 --> 00:40:48,584
a dream come true.

994
00:40:48,618 --> 00:40:50,219
I am gonna be
a star on Broadway.

995
00:40:50,253 --> 00:40:52,021
And I'm not gonna let one moment

996
00:40:52,055 --> 00:40:54,623
of this amazing,
life-altering experience

997
00:40:54,658 --> 00:40:58,060
be ruined by two friends
who aren't even my friends...

998
00:40:58,094 --> 00:40:59,728
That's it.

999
00:40:59,763 --> 00:41:01,130
I'm done. I'm leaving.
Okay. Cool.

1000
00:41:01,164 --> 00:41:02,998
