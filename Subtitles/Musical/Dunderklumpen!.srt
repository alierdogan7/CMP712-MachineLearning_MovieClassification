1
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,260
DUNDERKLUMPEN!

2
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,680
It was midsummer's night
in the northern Jämtland.

3
00:02:07,354 --> 00:02:10,889
And where all is silent.

4
00:02:12,193 --> 00:02:18,476
A night when the sun never sets
and it is always light.

5
00:02:19,283 --> 00:02:20,379
Peaceful.

6
00:02:21,086 --> 00:02:24,209
Peaceful and quiet!

7
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:30,482
And this was an island
in a beautiful lake.

8
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:36,482
A land where anything
could happen!

9
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:14,502
What an extraordinary night!

10
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,062
Fantastic, isn't it?

11
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,890
Want some coffee?

12
00:03:22,191 --> 00:03:23,491
Yes, nothing could be better.

13
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:26,892
Oh, my back!

14
00:03:28,952 --> 00:03:29,793
Say...

15
00:03:30,031 --> 00:03:32,484
Did you pick some flowers?

16
00:03:32,685 --> 00:03:36,796
No, there were so many bees
gathering nectar among the roses,

17
00:03:36,805 --> 00:03:40,397
I did not even got the chance
to pick them.

18
00:03:43,184 --> 00:03:46,499
- How many bees are there?
- We'll get lots of honey this year.

19
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,091
They're so soft that you must
touch them. There backs, I mean.

20
00:03:52,292 --> 00:03:54,401
The coats they wear.

21
00:03:55,546 --> 00:03:57,905
It would be so nice to touch them.

22
00:04:00,464 --> 00:04:03,923
Have you been upstairs to check
the children?

23
00:04:04,754 --> 00:04:07,489
Camilla is sleeping like a baby.
It is 23:00 already.

24
00:04:08,183 --> 00:04:10,995
- Where is Jens anyway?
- 23:00?

25
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,839
That's because the summer's night,
it remains a long light.

26
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:35,043
It is an extraordinary night
indeed.

27
00:04:35,886 --> 00:04:39,177
- Hey, I think...
- I should go to search Jens.

28
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:14,750
Jens!

29
00:05:15,651 --> 00:05:16,651
Where are you?

30
00:05:17,352 --> 00:05:18,352
Come here!

31
00:05:27,852 --> 00:05:29,054
Jens!

32
00:05:43,857 --> 00:05:46,700
Look at this!
It's a bumblebee.

33
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,710
I see.

34
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,169
Must be the sugar
you are looking after.

35
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:52,130
There you are, little bee.

36
00:05:53,301 --> 00:05:54,131
But hold on a moment!

37
00:05:54,141 --> 00:05:58,131
It would be much better
with some juice over,

38
00:05:58,662 --> 00:06:00,363
to make it tastier.

39
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:05,264
Help yourself.

40
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,866
He is hungry.

41
00:06:12,477 --> 00:06:15,377
I just want to feel
his warm fur coat.

42
00:06:15,378 --> 00:06:17,079
It's so soft.

43
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,370
Finally.

44
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:28,072
Finally, I get to play!

45
00:06:28,694 --> 00:06:34,073
What a darlings all.
I don't know what should I choose.

46
00:06:39,904 --> 00:06:41,936
What a nice guy!

47
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,738
My heart is beating!

48
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:48,839
You made me alive.

49
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,801
Hello, I am Dunderklumpen.

50
00:06:55,643 --> 00:07:00,782
At first Dummy thought...
he had to do with a big carrot.

51
00:07:03,484 --> 00:07:06,884
Oh dear, oh dear.
I think you are so funny!

52
00:07:07,485 --> 00:07:08,785
I will take you!

53
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:13,653
What a fine teddy bear!

54
00:07:14,054 --> 00:07:16,354
I will first breathe some life
into you.

55
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:25,360
I'm so happy...

56
00:07:26,418 --> 00:07:28,883
and all I can say...

57
00:07:29,271 --> 00:07:32,241
it's how do you do...

58
00:07:32,842 --> 00:07:35,039
today.

59
00:07:46,627 --> 00:07:49,445
And you are the cutest of all.

60
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:07,149
You think he hurt himself?

61
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,250
No.

62
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:13,852
A little attempt to run away.

63
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:22,177
I think your pants are too long.

64
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:25,078
Come, come.

65
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:26,879
Come along, dotted lion.

66
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,381
Do you think he's going
to steal us?

67
00:08:31,082 --> 00:08:35,218
If I did not have very cold arms,
I climbed out of the bag already.

68
00:08:35,873 --> 00:08:37,948
Oh, what a pretty doll!

69
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:41,949
Look little Doll,
there is plenty of room in my bag.

70
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:44,806
Come along
and you can sleep in my bag.

71
00:08:46,248 --> 00:08:47,474
I will not.

72
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,800
Come, sleep in my bag.
It's nice there.

73
00:08:51,101 --> 00:08:52,091
No!

74
00:08:54,397 --> 00:08:55,760
- Yes. Come on.
- No!

75
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,820
Yes.

76
00:08:57,392 --> 00:08:59,776
I will not!
I will not come!

77
00:08:59,877 --> 00:09:02,151
Say yes like a good girl.

78
00:09:02,652 --> 00:09:03,658
Come on now.

79
00:09:04,353 --> 00:09:07,287
Or else I'll have to use force
and I am very, very strong,

80
00:09:07,788 --> 00:09:08,979
you know.

81
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:11,147
O, dear!

82
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,490
I want cookies.

83
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:15,673
Yeah, well, I have
a delicious cake in my bag.

84
00:09:16,793 --> 00:09:18,556
Oh, no.
There is not.

85
00:09:18,918 --> 00:09:21,336
It's true. There is.

86
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:24,499
I do not believe it.

87
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:27,543
I think I'll have a look.

88
00:09:36,027 --> 00:09:38,006
Oh, watch out...

89
00:09:38,468 --> 00:09:39,774
But what is that?

90
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:44,011
What can it be?
It looks like a treasure chest.

91
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:47,000
Not bad.
Not bad at all.

92
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:01,930
Jens!

93
00:10:11,537 --> 00:10:12,537
Jens!

94
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,838
It is very late!

95
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,040
Jens!

96
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:31,500
I want you to come home now!

97
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:35,702
Camilla's already down to sleep.

98
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:20,346
Hello!

99
00:11:20,357 --> 00:11:22,160
Hey, where are you taking us?

100
00:11:22,217 --> 00:11:24,684
- Jens!
- Camilla! Jens!

101
00:11:25,912 --> 00:11:27,185
Camilla!

102
00:11:27,868 --> 00:11:30,087
We are kidnapped!

103
00:11:32,243 --> 00:11:35,588
We do not want it.
We want to go home!

104
00:11:36,403 --> 00:11:37,990
Camilla!

105
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:44,123
Help!
We do not want it.

106
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:47,311
Get us outta here!

107
00:12:24,616 --> 00:12:25,516
Jens, where are you?

108
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:27,617
Later it will cool down.

109
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,320
Jens!

110
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:46,556
Hey, winged friend.
What brings you down here?

111
00:12:46,923 --> 00:12:48,424
Shouldn't you be with your friends
on the flowers?

112
00:12:48,825 --> 00:12:50,496
No, I'm a poet.

113
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:55,096
I was heading south when I went
forth and went north course.

114
00:12:55,497 --> 00:12:56,577
Before you go,

115
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,010
would you fly up
and look for Jens in the woods?

116
00:12:59,511 --> 00:13:01,811
Fly up?
I've only just arrived.

117
00:13:02,212 --> 00:13:03,328
Okay!

118
00:13:03,463 --> 00:13:06,049
You have the sweetiest,
most delicious kind of food I found.

119
00:13:06,063 --> 00:13:08,049
So just for that I hang around.

120
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:17,675
Oh, what a boat!

121
00:13:18,025 --> 00:13:21,725
With that seesaw
I will get seasick soon.

122
00:13:29,847 --> 00:13:30,954
Chief! Chief!

123
00:13:31,255 --> 00:13:32,382
I saw them.

124
00:13:32,683 --> 00:13:37,382
I saw a mysterious boat,
with some weard creatures in it.

125
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:42,233
And Jens was chasing after them
with his goat on a raft.

126
00:13:42,878 --> 00:13:44,015
- Follow me quickly.
- Okay.

127
00:14:10,247 --> 00:14:11,847
Everything happens to me!

128
00:14:20,087 --> 00:14:21,089
Jens!

129
00:14:21,117 --> 00:14:22,050
Come back.

130
00:14:23,451 --> 00:14:24,450
Jens!

131
00:14:33,188 --> 00:14:34,153
Wait a minute.

132
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:38,035
Jens!

133
00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:41,356
Jens!
Wait!

134
00:14:42,154 --> 00:14:43,138
Jens!

135
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:44,559
I am coming!

136
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:48,960
Jens!

137
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,261
What are you going...

138
00:14:52,253 --> 00:14:53,963
I'm coming to get you.

139
00:14:59,141 --> 00:15:03,260
Bring back those toys!
There are mine and Camilla's!

140
00:15:10,893 --> 00:15:11,862
Jens!

141
00:15:12,636 --> 00:15:13,633
Wait!

142
00:15:21,035 --> 00:15:23,094
Come home! We are going to do...

143
00:15:23,744 --> 00:15:24,746
funny things,

144
00:15:25,337 --> 00:15:26,437
then we make pancakes...

145
00:15:27,544 --> 00:15:28,735
and you may stay up late.

146
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:34,936
Jens!

147
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:37,938
Jens!

148
00:15:53,054 --> 00:15:54,318
Wait right there.

149
00:16:07,624 --> 00:16:09,291
Where are you going anyway?

150
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,061
Hey!

151
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:25,495
Hello.

152
00:16:29,287 --> 00:16:30,047
You!

153
00:16:30,548 --> 00:16:32,048
Who are you anyway?

154
00:16:34,048 --> 00:16:37,081
Who, who, who, who, who,
who are you?

155
00:16:39,638 --> 00:16:44,115
Dummy thinks he's Santa and we're
the gifts he carries in his sack.

156
00:16:44,657 --> 00:16:46,485
Lucky child who gets me.

157
00:16:47,477 --> 00:16:51,473
I want ice cream, I want ice cream!
I want some, want some, want some!

158
00:16:52,254 --> 00:16:53,873
Ice cream in the woods!

159
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,884
What an experience!
This could be dangerous!

160
00:16:57,669 --> 00:16:59,259
What if he's after my pants?

161
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:03,505
Without my sensational pants,
I'm nobody!

162
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,427
I know just where we are!

163
00:17:05,986 --> 00:17:09,387
100 degrees by northwest
or the other way round.

164
00:17:11,006 --> 00:17:12,922
I put this thermometer in my mouth,

165
00:17:13,006 --> 00:17:15,642
I feel my pulse
and it is 2 million degrees.

166
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,428
And that's how I can tell
that I am nuts!

167
00:17:18,857 --> 00:17:21,529
And who are you?
You must be nuts to carry us all.

168
00:17:24,698 --> 00:17:26,801
You are a funny one.
You really are.

169
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:28,792
Who am I then?

170
00:17:29,503 --> 00:17:31,403
I'll tell you who I am,
I'll tell you.

171
00:17:35,504 --> 00:17:41,826
I am Dunderklumpen
from Mount Dunderklumpen.

172
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,034
As nice as apple pie.

173
00:17:46,485 --> 00:17:48,635
Never hurt a fly.

174
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:58,001
Never did know why
I was so lonesome.

175
00:18:00,207 --> 00:18:03,386
And when I was alone I would try
and cheer myself with music.

176
00:18:04,634 --> 00:18:10,944
Loneley Dunderklumpen
looked for songs to hum when

177
00:18:11,737 --> 00:18:13,870
no one came around

178
00:18:15,402 --> 00:18:17,501
always played a clown.

179
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:27,009
Now with friends I've found
I can't get lonesome.

180
00:18:28,055 --> 00:18:29,655
Why have I brought you here?

181
00:18:30,255 --> 00:18:31,596
Because I wanted to have
some friends.

182
00:18:32,661 --> 00:18:33,577
Listen,

183
00:18:33,622 --> 00:18:35,581
could I dance with you Lionel?

184
00:18:37,256 --> 00:18:38,588
And may I dance with you Doll?

185
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:40,536
First tell me who are you.

186
00:18:41,156 --> 00:18:44,647
What did you do all your life
when you were all alone and lonesome?

187
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,639
Well, I'll tell you,

188
00:18:47,306 --> 00:18:49,260
but first I'll need an orchestra.

189
00:18:49,657 --> 00:18:51,887
Pellegnillot, 		 	
you can play the harmonica.

190
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:56,116
And you Doll, you can play
the spider web.

191
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:03,188
That's it. And Dummy can play
the nails and the hammer.

192
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,178
And you Lionel,
you can play the saw.

193
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:11,370
Bravo Lionel, bravo!

194
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:15,035
And I can play the conductor
and dance!

195
00:19:15,753 --> 00:19:17,273
1, 2, 3, 4.

196
00:19:18,795 --> 00:19:20,877
I am now 42 years old

197
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:23,596
but I can think back
to when I was two

198
00:19:24,265 --> 00:19:26,824
or 10 years old, or 32, its simple!

199
00:19:27,641 --> 00:19:28,572
Understand?

200
00:19:29,322 --> 00:19:30,453
No? Well...

201
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:34,326
What I mean is
I'm still everybody

202
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:35,675
who I once was.

203
00:19:36,327 --> 00:19:37,243
Yes, really.

204
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:41,303
There are times when I feel
1 year old and I go like this...

205
00:19:44,453 --> 00:19:45,470
Oh, really.

206
00:19:45,641 --> 00:19:47,426
And other times I giggle
just as though I were 5 years old.

207
00:19:49,677 --> 00:19:50,574
Oh, really.

208
00:19:50,928 --> 00:19:54,162
And sometimes I can whistle
the way a 3 year old tries to do it.

209
00:19:57,634 --> 00:19:58,687
Oh, oh, really.

210
00:19:58,888 --> 00:20:01,629
And there're times that I can break
a branch like a 30 year old!

211
00:20:02,155 --> 00:20:03,169
Oh, oh, really.

212
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:06,146
And times I shoot a slingshot
but I aim it like a 10 year old!

213
00:20:08,143 --> 00:20:09,401
And I can shout:

214
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:11,606
take cover, take cover!

215
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:13,488
Just like a 40 year old.

216
00:20:14,386 --> 00:20:16,114
And then I can play
with a teddy bear

217
00:20:17,027 --> 00:20:19,197
and fight with one as well.

218
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,007
Do you understand it now?

219
00:20:22,425 --> 00:20:26,477
Do you? I mean,
I'm still everybody I once was.

220
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:31,500
That's what it was like
when I was all alone and lonesome.

221
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,376
And I played by myself.

222
00:20:34,158 --> 00:20:37,275
The 5 year old has remained
in the 42 year old.

223
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:43,196
Yes, I was 42 different people,
one for every year that I lived.

224
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:47,181
Because I was so lonesome,
so lonesome...

225
00:20:47,696 --> 00:20:51,334
But now I have all of you,
I'll never again be lonesome.

226
00:20:52,315 --> 00:20:58,532
Sing with Dunderklumpen.
Shake your happy rump and

227
00:20:58,968 --> 00:21:01,533
play an instrument.

228
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:05,233
Dance until you're spent

229
00:21:06,134 --> 00:21:14,988
to your heart's content
with Dunderklumpen.

230
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:23,180
When you're in a slumpin'
Play with Dunderklumpen.

231
00:21:23,845 --> 00:21:26,361
Go out in the sun,

232
00:21:27,295 --> 00:21:29,877
foolish ears are done

233
00:21:30,678 --> 00:21:38,700
when you're having fun
with Dunderklumpen.

234
00:22:03,743 --> 00:22:04,643
Hey there, boy!

235
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:09,136
I'm one of the flying
bumblebee police.

236
00:22:09,607 --> 00:22:12,245
Can you stand on two hands?
I can stand on one hand.

237
00:22:13,422 --> 00:22:14,381
You know...

238
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:17,581
Well, I should be
a police helicopter.

239
00:22:18,282 --> 00:22:22,481
Bee police calling the chief!
Bee police calling the chief!

240
00:22:22,938 --> 00:22:24,112
Here he is!

241
00:22:27,601 --> 00:22:28,422
Jens!

242
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:29,483
Are you there?

243
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:31,084
Yes!

244
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:35,872
But I musn't lose them now.
They must be nearby.

245
00:22:36,945 --> 00:22:38,886
I've heard them singing.
I have to hurry.

246
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:44,228
Chief! Chief!

247
00:22:45,734 --> 00:22:47,074
Hey, bumblebee!
Did you find him?

248
00:22:47,591 --> 00:22:48,466
Well, naturally.

249
00:22:48,907 --> 00:22:50,087
- That way?
- Wrong.

250
00:22:50,108 --> 00:22:51,108
- That way then?
- Right.

251
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:52,019
Thank you.

252
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:52,945
You're welcome!

253
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,139
You really have to get moving,
chief.

254
00:23:03,294 --> 00:23:04,281
Uh, wait!

255
00:23:04,497 --> 00:23:05,794
Wait a second!

256
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:07,999
Look at this tree here!

257
00:23:09,295 --> 00:23:13,474
Now you are going to see a great
international circus attraction.

258
00:23:15,691 --> 00:23:17,589
What are you going to do,
Dunderklumpen?

259
00:23:20,288 --> 00:23:23,100
- The Dummy wants to go on.
- No, Dummy.

260
00:23:23,188 --> 00:23:24,613
I've just changed my mind.

261
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,497
Go on, Dunderklumpen.

262
00:23:44,228 --> 00:23:46,326
Hold on to the branch,
Dunderklumpen.

263
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,867
Go on, go on, go on!

264
00:23:58,714 --> 00:24:00,858
He didn't hold on to the branch!

265
00:24:35,569 --> 00:24:38,164
Jens, stop playing hide-and-seek!

266
00:24:39,287 --> 00:24:40,192
What?

267
00:24:40,906 --> 00:24:41,596
Did you hear that?

268
00:24:42,805 --> 00:24:43,997
Someone was shouting.

269
00:24:45,106 --> 00:24:46,178
Where did that come from?

270
00:24:46,397 --> 00:24:49,131
I can't stand anymore!

271
00:24:49,841 --> 00:24:50,834
Stop!

272
00:24:52,043 --> 00:24:55,573
Lions hear very well.
It comes from that way.

273
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:58,327
Then we'll go this way.
We'll escape over the lake.

274
00:24:58,703 --> 00:25:00,529
They mustn't catch up with us.

275
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:01,503
Jens!

276
00:25:03,715 --> 00:25:04,704
Jens!

277
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,506
Yes.

278
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,983
Here it is.

279
00:25:12,587 --> 00:25:16,597
And there are so many fish.
A whole mountain.

280
00:25:17,298 --> 00:25:19,421
Graylings and salmon trout.

281
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:21,261
How beautiful!

282
00:25:22,451 --> 00:25:24,413
But now kids, we must hurry.

283
00:25:25,084 --> 00:25:26,742
Do you see a log anyplace?

284
00:25:27,303 --> 00:25:29,157
Pellegnillot is standing on one.

285
00:25:29,608 --> 00:25:31,080
We'll take in.

286
00:25:37,856 --> 00:25:39,923
The Dummy can really feel
the high seas.

287
00:25:42,221 --> 00:25:46,094
Once there was a sailor

288
00:25:46,695 --> 00:25:50,453
with clothes that sailors wear.

289
00:25:51,096 --> 00:25:55,894
His name was weird
but never knew it anyone.

290
00:25:56,509 --> 00:26:00,416
Miracle was that he knew it.

291
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,796
You have to be quiet, Dummy.

292
00:26:05,361 --> 00:26:08,317
Remember now that they mustn't
hear us. Whisper.

293
00:26:08,617 --> 00:26:13,203
A sailor loves the waves that rock,

294
00:26:13,604 --> 00:26:17,897
his ship will never perish.

295
00:26:18,498 --> 00:26:22,689
A storm can shake a boat in dark

296
00:26:23,143 --> 00:26:27,006
when he stands in front
of the storm.

297
00:26:27,605 --> 00:26:31,742
Farewell,
farewell,

298
00:26:32,178 --> 00:26:35,961
farewell, dearest Jens.

299
00:26:36,703 --> 00:26:40,545
We will meet again some time.

300
00:26:41,145 --> 00:26:42,908
Farewell,

301
00:26:43,373 --> 00:26:45,125
Farewell,

302
00:26:45,654 --> 00:26:48,271
Farewell, dearest...

303
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,134
chest.

304
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:55,072
We'll meet no more, goodbye.

305
00:27:02,328 --> 00:27:08,350
Farewell, farewell,
o, loveliest of bears.

306
00:27:26,665 --> 00:27:29,641
Astronaut Pellegnillot	 		 	
now at the bottom of the lake,

307
00:27:29,742 --> 00:27:31,081
thinks he's on a moon mountain.

308
00:28:37,877 --> 00:28:41,003
Hey, just wait there,
I'm coming get you.

309
00:28:41,378 --> 00:28:42,360
Oh, help!

310
00:28:42,737 --> 00:28:43,814
He's catching up with us.

311
00:28:44,498 --> 00:28:46,668
He'll take you away from me.

312
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:51,248
Let the toys go,
there are mine and Camilla's.

313
00:28:51,733 --> 00:28:54,005
Hey there, Jens!
Here we are!

314
00:29:06,395 --> 00:29:08,032
Well, what do you know?

315
00:29:08,281 --> 00:29:09,153
I have a bite.

316
00:29:11,229 --> 00:29:14,719
What in heaven's name!
Is it you?

317
00:29:15,076 --> 00:29:18,683
And you actually got
the treasure chest back.

318
00:29:19,752 --> 00:29:20,884
But now we must hurry.

319
00:29:21,438 --> 00:29:22,575
I want some icecream.

320
00:29:24,271 --> 00:29:26,959
Please, Dunderklumpen.
I want some icecream.

321
00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:30,059
I want some, I want some,
I want some!

322
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,295
Jens!

323
00:29:56,905 --> 00:29:57,863
Jens!

324
00:30:11,586 --> 00:30:12,494
Help!

325
00:30:12,934 --> 00:30:14,869
Can anyone hear me?

326
00:30:16,152 --> 00:30:17,570
What!
They need me.

327
00:30:19,724 --> 00:30:22,737
This is
the helicopter towing company

328
00:30:23,428 --> 00:30:26,636
at your service.

329
00:30:32,094 --> 00:30:32,937
Pull!

330
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:35,739
Pull!

331
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:38,162
And here we go.

332
00:30:40,654 --> 00:30:44,898
Hold on tight, chief.
I don't want you to fall down.

333
00:30:47,052 --> 00:30:48,059
Not so fast!

334
00:30:49,091 --> 00:30:50,080
Slow down!

335
00:30:51,055 --> 00:30:52,031
Caution!

336
00:31:26,892 --> 00:31:30,393
Children, you know how happy I am.

337
00:31:30,494 --> 00:31:33,610
True friends worth gold.

338
00:31:36,053 --> 00:31:37,158
Dunderklumpen.

339
00:31:37,986 --> 00:31:39,591
And he's got a treasure chest.

340
00:31:41,054 --> 00:31:43,940
It makes you wonder
at what he needs it.

341
00:31:46,386 --> 00:31:48,219
I have to steal
that treasure chest.

342
00:31:48,762 --> 00:31:49,820
It will be hard.

343
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,925
That's my money!

344
00:32:31,782 --> 00:32:33,858
That's my money!

345
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,575
Hey! One Eye,

346
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,585
I thought that all this money
is falling from heaven.

347
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:44,651
Do you like money?

348
00:32:47,619 --> 00:32:50,661
Would you like to have
a lot of money?

349
00:32:51,922 --> 00:32:52,918
I think so.

350
00:32:53,393 --> 00:32:54,377
Then have some.

351
00:32:54,488 --> 00:32:57,442
Have as much as you can catch.

352
00:32:58,013 --> 00:33:01,241
Yippie!
What a bunch of money!

353
00:33:01,967 --> 00:33:04,285
Grab as much as you can.
Take all you want.

354
00:33:04,296 --> 00:33:04,915
Yes.

355
00:33:04,928 --> 00:33:07,101
- Thank you.
- Take as much as you like.

356
00:33:07,112 --> 00:33:09,309
A thousand thanks.
Thank you!

357
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:13,133
Out! Out with you!
Help me pick up the money.

358
00:33:13,303 --> 00:33:16,681
You can't see the forest
from the money.

359
00:33:19,134 --> 00:33:21,552
I'm gonna take it all.

360
00:33:39,587 --> 00:33:41,196
Pellegnillot, pick up the money.

361
00:33:41,247 --> 00:33:44,849
Yeah, I am doing that.
I've already a thousand million.

362
00:33:47,095 --> 00:33:48,563
Listen, Doll.

363
00:33:49,343 --> 00:33:50,908
My poor arms are frozen.

364
00:33:51,699 --> 00:33:52,571
Help me pick some.

365
00:33:52,772 --> 00:33:55,266
Is this playing money?

366
00:33:56,261 --> 00:33:57,569
Or is it real?

367
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,071
I've already gathered ten kilos.

368
00:34:13,557 --> 00:34:15,399
The Dummy thinks the're berries

369
00:34:15,808 --> 00:34:18,068
and he's going to pour jam
out of money.

370
00:34:19,209 --> 00:34:20,341
Dunderklumpen!

371
00:34:20,552 --> 00:34:22,411
Now we can buy anything we want.

372
00:34:22,432 --> 00:34:25,169
What? We get a town,
we can buy...

373
00:34:25,642 --> 00:34:27,607
you can have a whole ice cream van.

374
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:30,339
And... and I'm going to buy

375
00:34:30,782 --> 00:34:31,710
a chocolate factory!

376
00:34:33,591 --> 00:34:35,262
The treasure chest.

377
00:34:50,109 --> 00:34:52,561
Good morning...
dumbheads!

378
00:34:53,565 --> 00:34:54,736
They do not hear me.

379
00:35:01,062 --> 00:35:03,604
And Dummy thinks
this is a handkerchief.

380
00:35:06,252 --> 00:35:07,628
Here's to poor me.

381
00:35:10,154 --> 00:35:11,730
It is very cold.

382
00:35:23,752 --> 00:35:26,901
Money drives you all crazy.

383
00:35:28,622 --> 00:35:29,572
Goodbye.

384
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:38,742
Money, money,
how creepy everyone gets.

385
00:35:48,266 --> 00:35:51,293
It's snowing summer snow.

386
00:35:51,564 --> 00:35:54,161
It's swirling down,
it's swirling around.

387
00:35:54,364 --> 00:35:56,071
It's snowing money.

388
00:35:56,722 --> 00:35:58,182
The money!

389
00:36:11,156 --> 00:36:12,039
Fools!

390
00:37:20,642 --> 00:37:22,049
Hey, there!

391
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:24,535
On midsummer night,
we love to take flight.

392
00:37:24,549 --> 00:37:27,610
Not on the broom,
but with an umbrella.

393
00:37:33,446 --> 00:37:34,124
Hello, kid.

394
00:37:35,799 --> 00:37:36,694
Let's see...

395
00:37:36,844 --> 00:37:37,726
I mean...

396
00:37:37,834 --> 00:37:38,771
How fast...

397
00:37:39,449 --> 00:37:41,389
can you run a hundred meter?

398
00:37:41,645 --> 00:37:43,725
In eighteen seconds,
I would say.

399
00:37:43,986 --> 00:37:47,114
That is great.
Do you think I can run faster?

400
00:37:47,882 --> 00:37:48,863
Not so.

401
00:37:49,303 --> 00:37:51,585
I think it takes me
about six minutes.

402
00:37:51,971 --> 00:37:55,052
And by the way, something more.
You know what?

403
00:37:55,671 --> 00:37:57,944
How far can you throw that stone?

404
00:38:02,245 --> 00:38:06,079
That is great.
That throw I'd ever seen.

405
00:38:06,614 --> 00:38:07,842
Think I can throw farther?

406
00:38:09,614 --> 00:38:11,594
That's the farthest I can throw.

407
00:38:11,946 --> 00:38:15,227
And, uh... how high
can you jump on two feet?

408
00:38:18,977 --> 00:38:20,916
This jump I'd ever seen.

409
00:38:21,649 --> 00:38:22,925
Could I jump higher?

410
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:29,289
You win again.

411
00:38:30,312 --> 00:38:31,285
Look here.

412
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:34,225
Two slices of bread
with ham and butter.

413
00:38:34,905 --> 00:38:36,846
You can have one if you get dirty.

414
00:38:36,967 --> 00:38:39,336
To get dirty, madam?
You can't mean that.

415
00:38:39,946 --> 00:38:40,705
Madam?

416
00:38:41,123 --> 00:38:42,583
My name is Blossom.

417
00:38:43,179 --> 00:38:43,906
Now, where was I?

418
00:38:44,403 --> 00:38:47,443
Oh, yes!
You have to make a mess.

419
00:38:47,896 --> 00:38:48,820
Understood?

420
00:38:49,185 --> 00:38:50,541
Yes, I got it.

421
00:39:03,084 --> 00:39:06,175
Wipe your mouth at your arm
and your arms to your face.

422
00:39:06,339 --> 00:39:07,305
Can you whistle?

423
00:39:13,564 --> 00:39:14,784
Do you want me to whistle?

424
00:39:17,498 --> 00:39:19,786
You laughed. There is my music.

425
00:39:20,204 --> 00:39:21,587
My music.

426
00:39:22,456 --> 00:39:23,386
Well,

427
00:39:24,271 --> 00:39:25,637
now you're all cheered up.

428
00:39:26,181 --> 00:39:27,377
But why were you sad?

429
00:39:28,731 --> 00:39:33,567
A thief has my treasure chest
and the Dummy and Lionel...

430
00:39:34,428 --> 00:39:36,437
and Pellegnillot and the Doll.

431
00:39:36,452 --> 00:39:38,047
And all those mosquitoes
were chasing me.

432
00:39:38,248 --> 00:39:40,980
Then I came here.

433
00:39:41,378 --> 00:39:44,593
And now I'll never be able
to find them all.

434
00:39:44,604 --> 00:39:46,230
Of course you will.

435
00:39:46,611 --> 00:39:48,229
Come on! I know what to do.

436
00:39:48,397 --> 00:39:53,327
We must think and listen.
We'll ask the waterfall.

437
00:39:53,914 --> 00:39:54,809
Come on!

438
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:08,159
How can know the waterfall
from the mountain?

439
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:10,335
Not so loud.

440
00:40:10,973 --> 00:40:12,217
He can hear you.

441
00:40:13,196 --> 00:40:17,716
Oh, small lake,
with such a beautiful waterfall.

442
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,967
Listen.

443
00:40:32,004 --> 00:40:34,681
Waterfall.

444
00:40:35,207 --> 00:40:38,083
Good morning.

445
00:40:38,684 --> 00:40:39,567
What do I hear?

446
00:40:39,791 --> 00:40:43,034
What do I hear
is a beautiful flower singing.

447
00:40:45,661 --> 00:40:48,974
Waterfall.

448
00:40:49,336 --> 00:40:52,220
Good morning.

449
00:40:53,705 --> 00:40:58,862
What do I hear there
my beautiful flower?

450
00:40:59,786 --> 00:41:05,935
I sing a song my clean rock

451
00:41:06,402 --> 00:41:11,780
at the edge of the waterfall.

452
00:41:14,037 --> 00:41:15,898
I wanted to ask you something.

453
00:41:15,899 --> 00:41:18,210
- How sweet of you.
- It would be an honor.

454
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,365
Say it once, what do you mean.

455
00:41:20,777 --> 00:41:21,672
The boy?

456
00:41:22,194 --> 00:41:23,780
Is about Dunderklumpen.

457
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:24,805
What?

458
00:41:25,069 --> 00:41:26,217
Dunderklumpen.

459
00:41:27,202 --> 00:41:29,538
Waterfall.

460
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,771
Where are they?

461
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:34,595
Who? What did you say?

462
00:41:34,796 --> 00:41:36,856
I did not hear so well.

463
00:41:37,057 --> 00:41:39,266
It was... Dunderklumpen.

464
00:41:39,703 --> 00:41:40,836
Dunderklumpen!

465
00:41:41,905 --> 00:41:43,104
- Maybe...
- Yes?

466
00:41:43,105 --> 00:41:46,549
Maybe you can tell me.
Waterfall.

467
00:41:47,407 --> 00:41:50,251
Where are they going?

468
00:41:51,734 --> 00:41:56,311
Dunderklumpen... yes, yes,
to the giant mountain and...

469
00:41:56,399 --> 00:42:01,479
and also Dunderklumpen
and the others are...

470
00:42:02,348 --> 00:42:04,411
Thank you.
Yes, yes.

471
00:42:04,872 --> 00:42:10,594
That sweet clean rock

472
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:16,590
at the edge of the waterfall.

473
00:42:17,356 --> 00:42:18,880
- Are you thirsty?
- What?

474
00:42:18,885 --> 00:42:19,893
Are you thirsty?

475
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:21,294
I do!

476
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:23,953
There is water in abundance.

477
00:42:24,532 --> 00:42:25,266
Thank you.

478
00:42:26,954 --> 00:42:27,956
Forget it.

479
00:42:29,872 --> 00:42:31,026
Blossom.

480
00:42:31,763 --> 00:42:32,882
Goodbye.

481
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:48,360
I now know the way!

482
00:42:48,835 --> 00:42:49,791
Come, Jens!

483
00:42:49,925 --> 00:42:50,712
Follow me!

484
00:42:50,882 --> 00:42:55,003
Follow me to Bird Mountain
and I show you where everybody is.

485
00:43:13,452 --> 00:43:15,820
Hey, there! Hello!
Here I am.

486
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:20,076
Here you have a good view, Jens.

487
00:43:20,528 --> 00:43:22,575
Look out over the world.
Look carefully.

488
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:26,516
There.

489
00:43:27,493 --> 00:43:30,041
There is Dunderklumpen
and all your friends.

490
00:43:30,535 --> 00:43:31,482
And over there.

491
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,438
There's your dad looking for you
with the help of the bee.

492
00:43:37,829 --> 00:43:38,718
And there...

493
00:43:39,019 --> 00:43:41,530
there is One Eye riding
his bike.

494
00:43:42,315 --> 00:43:44,941
He got the teasure chest

495
00:43:44,995 --> 00:43:48,181
by tricking Dunderklumpen
with a lot of counterfeit money.

496
00:43:50,986 --> 00:43:53,887
Look! One Eye is getting away
on that timber float.

497
00:43:54,168 --> 00:43:57,396
Dad! One Eye has stolen
the treasure chest!

498
00:43:57,757 --> 00:44:00,165
He's on a timber float,
over there.

499
00:44:03,408 --> 00:44:04,394
Jens?

500
00:44:04,556 --> 00:44:07,108
He sits on that timber float!

501
00:44:07,958 --> 00:44:08,901
What?

502
00:44:10,548 --> 00:44:11,549
Timber float?

503
00:44:12,052 --> 00:44:15,371
Hurry up, chief!
There is a boat down at the shore.

504
00:44:19,784 --> 00:44:22,957
Get him, dad!
Get him, dad!

505
00:44:23,186 --> 00:44:25,643
Can your father catch up
with that timber float

506
00:44:25,736 --> 00:44:27,829
and get the treasure chest back
from One Eye?

507
00:44:28,243 --> 00:44:29,916
Do your best!

508
00:44:30,364 --> 00:44:32,387
Dad can't handle this alone.

509
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,614
I have to help him.

510
00:44:33,985 --> 00:44:35,158
Goodbye, Blossom.

511
00:44:35,995 --> 00:44:40,295
Hurry now! Go ahead!
Your daddy is waiting for you.

512
00:44:56,845 --> 00:44:59,464
Stop!
There is a thief on the float.

513
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:05,197
Stop!
There is a thief on the float.

514
00:45:09,598 --> 00:45:11,157
Be careful Jens, don't fall!

515
00:45:11,288 --> 00:45:13,090
Do you have to keep
that goat with you, do you?

516
00:45:13,151 --> 00:45:14,659
Don't talk! Please, let hurry!

517
00:45:18,774 --> 00:45:20,132
I can see the treasure chest.

518
00:45:23,865 --> 00:45:26,834
That is really awful.
They are about to catch me up.

519
00:45:29,375 --> 00:45:31,798
- Faster, daddy! Faster!
- I'm doing my best.

520
00:45:31,808 --> 00:45:33,745
Faster! Here is One Eye.

521
00:45:35,127 --> 00:45:36,095
Faster!

522
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,807
I can't row... any faster.

523
00:45:48,974 --> 00:45:51,750
Go on! Go on!

524
00:45:52,274 --> 00:45:54,166
- Well done, dad.
- It has broken.

525
00:45:59,595 --> 00:46:03,201
Those fools. Look at that.
Now I feel safe again.

526
00:46:13,002 --> 00:46:15,780
We'll get you anyway, One Eye.

527
00:46:19,035 --> 00:46:20,923
But... but what was that?

528
00:46:29,397 --> 00:46:30,725
Look, there is a crow there.

529
00:46:47,432 --> 00:46:49,847
Let go!
That's mine.

530
00:46:50,047 --> 00:46:51,314
Stupid crow.

531
00:46:51,659 --> 00:46:54,934
Let go, I say. That's mine,
you silly crow or eagle.

532
00:46:56,165 --> 00:46:59,331
Whatever you are,
give it back to me! You...

533
00:47:00,687 --> 00:47:01,808
You... Help!

534
00:47:04,251 --> 00:47:07,760
Stupid crow...
Annoying stupid chicken.

535
00:47:08,351 --> 00:47:09,352
Help!

536
00:47:11,403 --> 00:47:13,648
We'll get back that treasure chest.

537
00:47:15,547 --> 00:47:16,949
I'll get it, just wait.

538
00:47:18,843 --> 00:47:20,851
It goes better with one oar.

539
00:47:23,766 --> 00:47:24,353
Put me down!

540
00:47:26,217 --> 00:47:27,076
Put me down!

541
00:47:35,541 --> 00:47:36,478
Put me down!

542
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,401
Put me down!

543
00:48:04,913 --> 00:48:07,965
There now.
That's seems to be everything.

544
00:48:08,482 --> 00:48:12,301
Thanks Doll, Pellegnillot,
Lionel and Dummy.

545
00:48:12,672 --> 00:48:14,231
Now we go home to my house.

546
00:49:11,732 --> 00:49:12,658
Jens, wait a minute.

547
00:49:13,172 --> 00:49:14,079
Listen.

548
00:49:14,502 --> 00:49:18,048
You and the goat better go that way
and the bee and I the other way.

549
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:19,512
And we'll meet again
at Jorm Mountain.

550
00:49:19,878 --> 00:49:21,400
Thus we'll find the treasure chest.

551
00:49:24,483 --> 00:49:25,545
See you!

552
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:28,556
See you, boy.

553
00:50:02,631 --> 00:50:06,848
We're the richest in the world
so shout it

554
00:50:07,272 --> 00:50:11,095
singing loud
so there's no doubt about it.

555
00:50:11,496 --> 00:50:15,780
A wonderland is Dunderland.
Oh, what a wonder.

556
00:50:16,121 --> 00:50:20,349
A wonderland is Dunderland.
Oh, what a wonder.

557
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:25,541
You know what?
I'll never sleep as long as I live.

558
00:50:25,732 --> 00:50:28,502
We shall only play
and dance and sing!

559
00:50:31,019 --> 00:50:33,756
Tea for two and you for me.

560
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:35,514
That's all wrong!

561
00:50:38,297 --> 00:50:39,732
Sing after me.

562
00:50:47,184 --> 00:50:51,299
We're the richest in the world
so shout it

563
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:55,679
Singing loud
so there's no doubt about it.

564
00:50:56,098 --> 00:51:00,164
A wonderland is Dunderland.
Oh, what a wonder.

565
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:04,709
A wonderland is Dunderland.
Oh, what a wonder.

566
00:51:17,512 --> 00:51:25,176
Look at that! Real people.
I don't believe it.

567
00:51:25,675 --> 00:51:30,644
Don't be afraid.
Come closer. It's me.

568
00:51:30,909 --> 00:51:33,178
The Dummy thinks that house
just talked to us.

569
00:51:33,458 --> 00:51:35,536
I did. I can talk.

570
00:51:37,149 --> 00:51:38,075
Who said that?

571
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:40,379
Somebody has just talked there.

572
00:51:40,799 --> 00:51:41,760
I did.

573
00:51:43,415 --> 00:51:44,701
Was that you Pellegnillot?

574
00:51:44,959 --> 00:51:47,914
No, it was me, "The House".

575
00:51:49,207 --> 00:51:54,019
Do you know what? That's crazy,
that house did speak to us.

576
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:57,083
We have no time to waste,
we must hurry up now.

577
00:51:57,215 --> 00:52:00,795
No! Please stay!
Please.

578
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:05,280
It's been a hundred years
since anyone has passed this way

579
00:52:05,351 --> 00:52:06,980
and I had no one to talk with.

580
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:09,554
I'm so lonesome.

581
00:52:10,115 --> 00:52:16,473
Yes, yes, yes. Come in.
Come in. Be welcome!

582
00:52:16,942 --> 00:52:18,968
All right, Lionel. That's exactly
what Dummy would do.

583
00:52:26,294 --> 00:52:28,289
Go on in, Lionel. You're afraid?

584
00:52:32,126 --> 00:52:33,131
Open the door!

585
00:52:34,775 --> 00:52:40,880
Be it ever so humble
just how I love sweet home.

586
00:52:41,171 --> 00:52:42,145
Just you.

587
00:52:44,421 --> 00:52:47,045
How nice!

588
00:52:47,246 --> 00:52:52,602
How nice to have someone
stand on the floor.

589
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:54,648
Lionel, don't be afraid. Go in.

590
00:53:01,613 --> 00:53:04,954
Yes.
This is how I look like.

591
00:53:05,442 --> 00:53:07,637
And this is all the company
I have.

592
00:53:07,652 --> 00:53:12,287
So please come in
and stamp on the floor.

593
00:53:12,348 --> 00:53:16,178
It was so long ago.
Yes, you come in, too.

594
00:53:18,033 --> 00:53:19,289
Come along, Lionel.

595
00:53:26,248 --> 00:53:27,367
I'm sorry.

596
00:53:43,185 --> 00:53:45,368
There are so many of you.

597
00:53:45,561 --> 00:53:46,516
Here we go then.

598
00:53:47,532 --> 00:53:50,009
The Dummy thinks
there is Lionel canned here.

599
00:53:51,341 --> 00:53:53,507
Is there really Lionel canned
in this can?

600
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:58,733
You're dumber than the dumbest
rabbit I've ever known.

601
00:53:59,163 --> 00:54:01,233
Opening a can at both ends!

602
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:08,090
I didn't know
canned food could talk.

603
00:54:08,815 --> 00:54:09,906
Here, canned food.

604
00:54:11,084 --> 00:54:12,107
Allow me to help you.

605
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:24,157
How happy I am.

606
00:54:26,868 --> 00:54:29,588
I think is canned rabbit
in this can.

607
00:54:31,809 --> 00:54:33,084
Dear canned food,

608
00:54:33,418 --> 00:54:38,406
I'll serve you with fried potatoes
for Dunderklumpen's dinner.

609
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:45,789
How funny they are.

610
00:54:56,689 --> 00:55:00,336
You are the best of house of man
and we shout it.

611
00:55:00,716 --> 00:55:04,564
Singing out
so there's no doubt about it.

612
00:55:04,609 --> 00:55:08,595
A wonderland is Dunderland.
Oh, what a wonder.

613
00:55:08,826 --> 00:55:12,716
A wonderland is Dunderland.
Oh, what a wonder.

614
00:55:21,377 --> 00:55:24,501
And wonder of joy storm on Jorm.

615
00:55:37,652 --> 00:55:41,482
Dunderklumpen's day is on thursday.

616
00:55:41,822 --> 00:55:45,348
Clap your hands
and let your buttocks bumping.

617
00:55:45,692 --> 00:55:49,555
A wonderland is Dunderland.
Oh, what a wonder.

618
00:55:49,867 --> 00:55:53,703
A wonderland is Dunderland.
Oh, what a wonder.

619
00:57:41,684 --> 00:57:43,171
Something is burning!

620
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,755
And Dummy says it is a fire.

621
00:57:46,225 --> 00:57:47,152
See?

622
00:57:47,677 --> 00:57:48,553
It's a fire!

623
00:57:48,675 --> 00:57:49,696
Run for your life.

624
00:57:50,081 --> 00:57:52,738
What an experience!
I swim.

625
00:57:53,231 --> 00:57:54,206
Do not worry.

626
00:57:54,783 --> 00:57:55,661
I'll save you.

627
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:01,620
Wait, don't leave me all alone!

628
00:58:01,623 --> 00:58:03,315
We have to wait for Lionel.

629
00:58:03,514 --> 00:58:06,644
What a terrible accident.

630
00:58:07,623 --> 00:58:09,793
Lionel where are you?
Come!

631
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:13,000
I saved you all!

632
00:58:13,409 --> 00:58:15,801
I saved the old house!
I have put out the fire.

633
00:58:18,364 --> 00:58:20,179
That was clever, wasn't it?

634
00:58:20,863 --> 00:58:25,016
You are the most handsome lion
in dotted pants of the world.

635
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:28,086
Come now,
we have to get the others.

636
00:58:29,226 --> 00:58:32,085
Wait! Don't run away from me.

637
01:00:13,534 --> 01:00:14,862
Come...
Come closer.

638
01:00:15,101 --> 01:00:19,734
That's a long time
since I've been touched by a hand.

639
01:00:19,765 --> 01:00:22,258
Come feel
but I am more than scrubland.

640
01:00:22,438 --> 01:00:24,488
Is this really a house that talks?

641
01:00:24,842 --> 01:00:27,179
Yes, I can talk.

642
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:29,639
The house can really talk.

643
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:31,374
Yes, that's right.

644
01:00:32,529 --> 01:00:35,689
You are welcome to look
further inside.

645
01:00:35,874 --> 01:00:36,663
Yes, I come.

646
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:38,670
Yes, cozy,
it looks like a doghouse.

647
01:00:38,958 --> 01:00:43,729
But you can talk inside
and it can be very cozy.

648
01:00:43,830 --> 01:00:46,330
Yes. So, it is that.

649
01:00:46,772 --> 01:00:51,279
Yes, because I can talk,
I am not so alone.

650
01:00:51,778 --> 01:00:54,735
Dunderklumpen and his friends
were here.

651
01:00:54,837 --> 01:01:00,400
And they were dancing and stamping
so I thought they would stay.

652
01:01:00,631 --> 01:01:02,458
But a fire broke out
and they went away.

653
01:01:02,791 --> 01:01:04,697
- But where are they now?
- They went that way.

654
01:01:05,105 --> 01:01:06,021
- Over there?
- Yes.

655
01:01:06,223 --> 01:01:07,107
Yes, yes.

656
01:01:07,292 --> 01:01:09,121
Thanks a lot.
Thank you, bye.

657
01:01:09,396 --> 01:01:10,566
Then I meet them down.

658
01:01:11,113 --> 01:01:12,897
Are you going to leave me?
Come back.

659
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:15,624
Come back!
Don't leave me alone!

660
01:01:15,675 --> 01:01:16,960
Come back!

661
01:01:20,268 --> 01:01:22,284
What made the house get fire?

662
01:01:22,426 --> 01:01:24,412
Do you think
One Eye could have done it?

663
01:01:25,365 --> 01:01:27,457
That was such a lovely house!

664
01:01:27,783 --> 01:01:29,800
I put out the fire.

665
01:01:30,176 --> 01:01:31,957
I saved the house.

666
01:01:32,286 --> 01:01:35,751
I bet you half a million
that was One Eye who lit the fire.

667
01:01:36,851 --> 01:01:41,367
We have to hurry now. Let's go!
And remember what I said:

668
01:01:41,623 --> 01:01:45,643
Our wonderland is Dunderland.
Oh, what a wonder.

669
01:01:46,042 --> 01:01:49,004
Yes, but you know what?
We saved the house.

670
01:01:49,722 --> 01:01:52,638
Can we have some candies?
Please!

671
01:01:52,939 --> 01:01:54,689
No, I don't have any.

672
01:01:55,151 --> 01:01:57,012
We are in a hurry.
Come on.

673
01:01:57,421 --> 01:01:58,765
You give me the treasure chest,

674
01:01:59,571 --> 01:02:00,689
then I'll come.

675
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,267
No, not right now.

676
01:02:02,694 --> 01:02:03,568
Yes, now.

677
01:02:03,901 --> 01:02:05,550
- I want it now!
- No.

678
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:06,618
Yes!

679
01:02:06,649 --> 01:02:07,941
- No.
- Yes!

680
01:02:08,442 --> 01:02:11,054
No, no, no.
This will not happen.

681
01:02:11,867 --> 01:02:13,511
I just want to take a look.

682
01:02:14,453 --> 01:02:16,550
Here, take it then.

683
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:18,651
She could not catch it.

684
01:02:20,876 --> 01:02:22,576
Now it's my turn.

685
01:02:27,003 --> 01:02:31,100
What an experience!
It's One Eye.

686
01:02:32,806 --> 01:02:33,851
What is he going to do?

687
01:02:34,733 --> 01:02:35,938
He took his hat off.

688
01:02:36,648 --> 01:02:38,239
Is he going to wash his hair?

689
01:02:38,530 --> 01:02:40,184
Look out everybody!

690
01:02:40,634 --> 01:02:44,810
The bravest lion in the whole
world is about to attack.

691
01:03:06,954 --> 01:03:10,184
That's it, Lionel!
Knock him out in the first round!

692
01:03:33,952 --> 01:03:36,466
What a marvelous artist he is.

693
01:03:42,034 --> 01:03:45,701
Watch out! Watch out!
Carefully, my little lion.

694
01:03:45,944 --> 01:03:46,942
Now listen here!

695
01:03:46,964 --> 01:03:51,072
You can get a thump
or you can just give up right now!

696
01:03:51,451 --> 01:03:52,755
Is that clear?

697
01:04:00,591 --> 01:04:04,542
The Dummy thinks that One Eye
really takes the treasure chest.

698
01:04:04,998 --> 01:04:09,302
Oh dear, what a disaster.
He's got the treasure chest.

699
01:04:14,353 --> 01:04:15,673
And the way he runs!

700
01:04:16,817 --> 01:04:17,724
Let's hurry.

701
01:04:18,032 --> 01:04:19,158
We must follow him.

702
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:20,413
Quickly!

703
01:04:22,117 --> 01:04:26,114
Step on it!
What an experience!

704
01:04:26,415 --> 01:04:28,388
Hold on! Wait for me!

705
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:29,805
Hold on! Wait for me!

706
01:04:30,406 --> 01:04:31,631
Hold on! Wait for me!

707
01:04:37,218 --> 01:04:38,492
Let's keep going, man!

708
01:04:38,767 --> 01:04:39,902
Watch out of the ditch.

709
01:04:40,552 --> 01:04:41,987
Shift here.

710
01:05:02,568 --> 01:05:06,167
Hello, you clever detective!
Get behind the wheel and let's go.

711
01:05:13,218 --> 01:05:14,050
Drive on.

712
01:05:14,629 --> 01:05:16,490
Straight ahead.
Don't spare the horses.

713
01:05:20,932 --> 01:05:22,899
Right to your target!

714
01:05:23,445 --> 01:05:24,689
Step on the gas!

715
01:05:25,243 --> 01:05:26,901
There is One Eye.

716
01:05:27,435 --> 01:05:28,333
Step on it!

717
01:05:29,576 --> 01:05:31,464
Turn right, turn left.

718
01:05:32,093 --> 01:05:33,237
Watch out to the trees!

719
01:05:34,101 --> 01:05:35,188
Step on the brakes!

720
01:05:35,478 --> 01:05:36,376
Dude, I give up.

721
01:05:36,577 --> 01:05:38,060
They gave him a drivers license.

722
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:47,892
Watch out!
Here I come and I stab you.

723
01:05:48,639 --> 01:05:50,125
Miss me, miss me, miss me!

724
01:05:50,407 --> 01:05:51,116
Wrong...

725
01:05:52,202 --> 01:05:53,173
Wrong again!

726
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:54,093
Get it!

727
01:05:54,279 --> 01:05:58,106
I get it, I get it, I get it,
I get it, I got it!

728
01:05:58,569 --> 01:06:00,645
Gorgeous!
I got it.

729
01:06:51,514 --> 01:06:53,989
And they gave him
a drivers license.

730
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:59,121
A flying patrol is on its way
and hunt so lone.

731
01:07:00,299 --> 01:07:01,569
Hello!

732
01:07:02,344 --> 01:07:04,315
Jens!

733
01:07:08,187 --> 01:07:10,539
I can not see
through the thick forest.

734
01:07:11,558 --> 01:07:14,125
But I do have a beautiful view.

735
01:07:14,770 --> 01:07:16,422
It's crazy.

736
01:07:16,917 --> 01:07:18,030
Hello!

737
01:07:18,446 --> 01:07:22,793
Jens!

738
01:07:23,095 --> 01:07:25,129
Hello!
Dad, where are you?

739
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:27,080
I am here...

740
01:07:27,941 --> 01:07:29,793
at the waterfall!

741
01:07:31,475 --> 01:07:33,092
Can you hear me?

742
01:07:34,716 --> 01:07:36,687
At the waterfall!

743
01:07:45,146 --> 01:07:51,469
I am Giant Jorm and I like
to bathe here.

744
01:07:52,702 --> 01:07:54,216
To bathe here.

745
01:07:55,344 --> 01:08:01,616
Now that I am here,
I really feel like a dandy.

746
01:08:02,869 --> 01:08:04,338
A dandy.

747
01:08:06,122 --> 01:08:09,475
Now I take a cloud to fix a hat

748
01:08:09,736 --> 01:08:14,031
and look again downwards
to mother earth.

749
01:08:16,230 --> 01:08:19,611
I deep in my toe and try,

750
01:08:19,822 --> 01:08:24,165
it's cold as ice,
how nice for us it's sunny.

751
01:08:25,618 --> 01:08:27,787
It's sunny.

752
01:08:30,904 --> 01:08:36,965
Giant Jorm	is happy
and walks in the sun.

753
01:08:38,165 --> 01:08:40,106
The sun.

754
01:08:40,984 --> 01:08:47,002
With a giant step he runs
the entire forest.

755
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:49,990
The forest.

756
01:08:51,395 --> 01:08:54,695
Now the cloud flies out of my hand

757
01:08:54,896 --> 01:08:59,252
And look again downwards
to mother earth.

758
01:09:01,401 --> 01:09:04,958
The country is so beautiful
and white.

759
01:09:05,071 --> 01:09:09,354
And you can see the mountains
in the distance from the island.

760
01:09:10,937 --> 01:09:12,888
The island.

761
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:16,571
Move on, crow.

762
01:09:17,726 --> 01:09:20,623
Go somewhere else
with that croacking.

763
01:09:38,150 --> 01:09:39,766
Malte!
Look there.

764
01:09:40,621 --> 01:09:42,608
Can you see who is there
on the other side?

765
01:09:43,266 --> 01:09:44,122
Do you know who is that?

766
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:45,946
It's such a sweetheart.

767
01:09:46,227 --> 01:09:47,674
It's the good Mountain Jorm.

768
01:09:48,132 --> 01:09:50,771
We quickly take a look
at the other side.

769
01:10:01,774 --> 01:10:04,687
They all are asleep.
How strange!

770
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:35,106
What!

771
01:10:35,717 --> 01:10:38,982
Who's bicycling all over me?

772
01:10:44,517 --> 01:10:45,693
Pellegnillot, stay with me.

773
01:10:46,074 --> 01:10:47,281
Oh, dear!

774
01:10:54,501 --> 01:10:55,819
Jorm!
Put me down.

775
01:10:56,144 --> 01:10:57,034
Put me down!

776
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:03,953
What a mess!

777
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:43,522
Go away!

778
01:11:43,713 --> 01:11:44,580
No, no.

779
01:11:48,111 --> 01:11:49,994
Malte!
Malte!

780
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:51,450
My goodness.

781
01:11:52,114 --> 01:11:56,171
You are the greatest.
Thank you, thank you.

782
01:11:57,027 --> 01:12:00,097
Now we'll cross over the lake
and go up into the hills.

783
01:12:00,337 --> 01:12:01,254
My home is there.

784
01:12:01,504 --> 01:12:05,324
Hello!

785
01:12:06,213 --> 01:12:07,748
Wait a minute.

786
01:12:08,481 --> 01:12:10,334
What shall I do with him?

787
01:12:10,997 --> 01:12:14,056
What happened?
Where is the treasure chest?

788
01:12:14,622 --> 01:12:17,057
It fell on the ground somewhere.

789
01:12:17,755 --> 01:12:20,777
But what shall I do
with One Eye then?

790
01:12:21,516 --> 01:12:23,002
Shall I throw him away?

791
01:12:23,366 --> 01:12:25,702
Put him on a deserted island!

792
01:12:26,428 --> 01:12:27,299
Good idea.

793
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:31,086
A deserted island.
In the middle of the lake.

794
01:12:31,533 --> 01:12:34,180
Where he may reflect
in the meantime.

795
01:12:34,761 --> 01:12:40,031
Good bye, One Eye, have fun.
I'm going away, my friend.

796
01:13:40,342 --> 01:13:45,109
Dad! Where are you?
I am over here.

797
01:13:46,026 --> 01:13:47,317
Here is daddy!

798
01:13:50,996 --> 01:13:57,124
Do you think we'll ever find Jens,
the toys or the treasure chest?

799
01:13:57,599 --> 01:13:59,331
We made a mess of it. Really!

800
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:03,405
The chief and the bee,
the bungler patrol limited.

801
01:14:04,445 --> 01:14:05,655
You could say that.

802
01:14:08,322 --> 01:14:11,180
Jorm put One Eye separately
to teach him a lesson.

803
01:14:13,565 --> 01:14:15,599
Is it...
Is it Beppe calling?

804
01:14:15,883 --> 01:14:17,540
Jens!

805
01:14:17,551 --> 01:14:19,061
Jump into the boat and go to him.

806
01:14:19,232 --> 01:14:20,816
Malte and I will watch out
on the shore.

807
01:14:30,557 --> 01:14:34,268
One million five hundred
and sixty thousand.

808
01:14:34,569 --> 01:14:39,125
One million five hundred
and seventy thousand.

809
01:14:40,524 --> 01:14:44,280
Dad!
Tell me where are you.

810
01:14:52,976 --> 01:14:56,965
A bungler patrol is lost
or you do know where we are.

811
01:14:58,116 --> 01:15:01,575
We sail for hours in the fog.
Come on, where are we?

812
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:04,024
We are right here!

813
01:15:04,885 --> 01:15:05,761
All right?

814
01:15:06,092 --> 01:15:07,463
Not so fast.

815
01:15:08,110 --> 01:15:09,290
More to starboard.

816
01:15:09,568 --> 01:15:10,529
Hold down.

817
01:15:10,755 --> 01:15:11,754
I want some ice cream!

818
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:13,301
We'll fall overboard.

819
01:15:16,308 --> 01:15:18,003
We have landed.

820
01:15:21,482 --> 01:15:23,062
Dad!

821
01:15:23,372 --> 01:15:24,929
Where are you?

822
01:15:26,871 --> 01:15:27,582
Jens!

823
01:15:27,596 --> 01:15:30,485
One Eye stole Pellegnillot	 		 	
and the treasure chest.

824
01:15:30,496 --> 01:15:33,730
- Stop the thief! Help!
- He has Pellegnillot.

825
01:15:34,570 --> 01:15:37,995
Run! Quickly! Try to stop him.

826
01:15:38,306 --> 01:15:40,320
- Everybody.
- Somebody do something!

827
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,165
What's going on?

828
01:15:47,434 --> 01:15:49,172
One Eye got the treasure chest
again!

829
01:15:49,178 --> 01:15:53,091
Go ahead! Hurry up now!
I'll catch up with you. Go on!

830
01:16:24,604 --> 01:16:28,584
Thanks for all that's been.

831
01:16:30,117 --> 01:16:34,576
Thanks for what's to be.

832
01:16:36,081 --> 01:16:41,325
Thanks for summer soft refrain.

833
01:16:41,841 --> 01:16:47,156
Thanks for wind and snow and rain.

834
01:16:47,745 --> 01:16:52,115
Thanks for all I see.

835
01:16:53,558 --> 01:16:58,097
Thanks that I am me.

836
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:05,040
Thanks for tears and laughter too.

837
01:17:05,488 --> 01:17:10,740
Thanks for strength
to see life through.

838
01:17:11,331 --> 01:17:15,574
Thanks for all that's been.

839
01:17:16,952 --> 01:17:21,772
Thanks for what's to be.

840
01:17:25,832 --> 01:17:27,690
To be...

841
01:17:31,919 --> 01:17:34,467
To be...

842
01:17:50,592 --> 01:17:53,787
- I'll catch him.
- We'll get you One Eye.

843
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:57,138
Hold on.

844
01:17:57,372 --> 01:17:58,832
We must help this nice lady.

845
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:00,798
Did you hurt yourself?

846
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:02,429
Listen to me now.

847
01:18:03,177 --> 01:18:05,594
Look,
I am Elvira Fattigan.

848
01:18:06,284 --> 01:18:08,336
I see that you're all chasing
One Eye.

849
01:18:08,747 --> 01:18:11,625
You see, I have known him
for a long, long time.

850
01:18:12,132 --> 01:18:13,269
He's not really bad.

851
01:18:14,178 --> 01:18:15,819
I know where he lives.

852
01:18:16,309 --> 01:18:19,364
High up in the mountains,
in a little hut.

853
01:18:20,193 --> 01:18:21,992
I point you guys the way.

854
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:25,418
Up to the mountains!

855
01:19:09,299 --> 01:19:10,204
Now then.

856
01:19:14,317 --> 01:19:16,405
Where are you Pellegnillot?

857
01:19:16,615 --> 01:19:18,151
Jens, here I am.

858
01:19:18,454 --> 01:19:19,866
Help!
Help!

859
01:19:20,097 --> 01:19:20,945
Be silent.

860
01:19:22,382 --> 01:19:24,724
I beg you, be still now.

861
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:26,571
Please.

862
01:19:49,008 --> 01:19:50,711
We are coming, Jens!

863
01:19:51,178 --> 01:19:52,502
Wait a little.

864
01:20:04,309 --> 01:20:10,605
Here we are! Here we are!
Here we come with my umbrella.

865
01:20:15,316 --> 01:20:17,639
Grab hold.
Grab hold of my umbrella.

866
01:20:18,248 --> 01:20:20,192
That's it, hold on.
Up!

867
01:20:21,012 --> 01:20:22,124
You are as heavy as lead.

868
01:20:30,430 --> 01:20:31,346
He is not home!

869
01:20:31,723 --> 01:20:33,243
He managed to sneak away.

870
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:36,777
Look there.
There he is.

871
01:20:49,230 --> 01:20:52,952
Don't be afraid Pellegnillot!
I just save you.

872
01:20:53,255 --> 01:20:54,282
I am coming, Jens.

873
01:20:55,708 --> 01:20:56,627
I'm coming.

874
01:20:57,358 --> 01:21:01,527
Dad, One Eye is on the top
of that mountain.

875
01:21:03,364 --> 01:21:04,678
What an experience!

876
01:21:07,473 --> 01:21:08,370
Jorm!

877
01:21:09,958 --> 01:21:10,911
Jorm!

878
01:21:17,009 --> 01:21:20,821
Why don't they leave me in peace
to sleep?

879
01:21:23,075 --> 01:21:24,792
What do you want now?

880
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:28,101
You must help Jens.
That little boy there.

881
01:21:28,675 --> 01:21:29,561
Who?

882
01:21:31,857 --> 01:21:32,804
Where?

883
01:21:33,026 --> 01:21:35,430
You must help Jens.
That little boy there.

884
01:21:35,755 --> 01:21:39,098
One Eye has stolen his beloved
teddy bear.

885
01:21:40,176 --> 01:21:41,047
Yes.

886
01:21:42,148 --> 01:21:46,494
Yes, well, you certainly
have made a mess of it again.

887
01:21:51,998 --> 01:21:53,654
Stop!
Don't you touch him.

888
01:21:54,867 --> 01:21:56,286
Don't hurt him.

889
01:21:56,628 --> 01:21:58,106
I'll talk to him myself.

890
01:21:58,431 --> 01:22:00,870
But why you, you're so old.

891
01:22:00,955 --> 01:22:03,570
I know him, so I will go.

892
01:22:08,010 --> 01:22:13,034
Leave me alone or I'll throw
the teddy bear down the mountain.

893
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:16,016
What an experience!
It's a disaster.

894
01:22:16,251 --> 01:22:18,249
Do you think
that lady can handle it?

895
01:22:19,056 --> 01:22:20,070
I hope so.

896
01:22:20,641 --> 01:22:21,917
What if she falls?

897
01:22:22,659 --> 01:22:25,538
Don't worry.
She was born in the mountains.

898
01:22:29,353 --> 01:22:30,194
Jens!

899
01:22:30,429 --> 01:22:32,696
I asked him to come.
Leave everything to me.

900
01:22:32,867 --> 01:22:34,314
Jens, I'm coming too!

901
01:22:35,744 --> 01:22:38,037
Jens!
I've come with the skis.

902
01:22:41,523 --> 01:22:42,525
Where have you been?

903
01:22:44,265 --> 01:22:46,288
Where have I been?
I was looking for you.

904
01:22:46,952 --> 01:22:49,475
Dad, look,
we have to help Pellegnillot.

905
01:22:49,481 --> 01:22:52,464
Isn't that dangerous?
She's going alone to see One Eye?

906
01:22:52,905 --> 01:22:53,875
She'll soon fall.

907
01:22:56,230 --> 01:22:57,873
Shall we get up closer?

908
01:23:27,277 --> 01:23:30,978
I've known you One Eye
ever since you were a boy.

909
01:23:32,221 --> 01:23:36,579
You were the sweetest, kindest,
most friendly child I ever saw.

910
01:23:38,041 --> 01:23:42,145
You liked everybody. People,
animals and all the nature.

911
01:23:42,284 --> 01:23:45,214
Mountains, forests, rivers.

912
01:23:45,801 --> 01:23:47,013
You loved everybody

913
01:23:47,793 --> 01:23:50,415
and you dreamed to all of these,
One Eye.

914
01:23:51,579 --> 01:23:52,499
But as you grew up

915
01:23:52,579 --> 01:23:56,109
you met people who loved
only material things and money.

916
01:23:57,259 --> 01:23:59,278
Who didn't love all the things
you did.

917
01:23:59,764 --> 01:24:02,318
Money was their only love.

918
01:24:03,468 --> 01:24:05,211
You felt more and more lonely

919
01:24:06,475 --> 01:24:08,127
and so alone.

920
01:24:09,358 --> 01:24:11,881
So alone, isn't it, One Eye?

921
01:24:13,332 --> 01:24:17,444
Money alone
does not bring happiness.

922
01:24:18,137 --> 01:24:22,200
Naturally you were disappointed
in everybody since then.

923
01:24:23,290 --> 01:24:25,868
But there are other people.

924
01:24:26,531 --> 01:24:31,847
Money is important. But...
not as important as people

925
01:24:33,181 --> 01:24:36,355
and animals and creatures.

926
01:24:37,271 --> 01:24:40,844
Creatures and all nature...

927
01:24:41,651 --> 01:24:43,044
and freedom.

928
01:24:44,137 --> 01:24:46,574
Freedom is also very important.

929
01:24:47,625 --> 01:24:48,551
Go ahead.

930
01:24:49,996 --> 01:24:52,345
Now you're free again,
Pellegnillot.

931
01:24:53,397 --> 01:24:55,507
Then your disappointment
turned to anger

932
01:24:56,013 --> 01:24:58,856
and you decided to payback
to all those people

933
01:24:59,739 --> 01:25:04,713
by behaving worse
than you thought they did.

934
01:25:05,711 --> 01:25:08,855
And that started you printing
counterfeit money.

935
01:25:09,201 --> 01:25:10,827
So greedy people
would hurt each other

936
01:25:11,197 --> 01:25:15,874
grabbing for it is it floated
through the air.

937
01:25:17,196 --> 01:25:18,252
Isn't that so?

938
01:25:19,606 --> 01:25:22,865
Then you saw Dunderklumpen
with the treasure chest.

939
01:25:23,612 --> 01:25:28,606
And you tricked him
and his friends with fake money.

940
01:25:29,225 --> 01:25:31,817
So you could kept
the treasure chest away.

941
01:25:32,638 --> 01:25:36,113
To teach him a lesson for wanting
the treasure in that chest.

942
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:41,524
Elvira Fattigan won't be able
to end this.

943
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:45,074
They will be sorry
they didn't send me there.

944
01:25:46,041 --> 01:25:49,604
Dummy thinks this is all a dream
so he pinches himself, ouch!

945
01:25:50,065 --> 01:25:51,225
No, it's not a dream.

946
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:55,377
And now we shall open
the treasure chest.

947
01:26:02,771 --> 01:26:06,680
You see One Eye? There is only
air in the treasure chest.

948
01:26:07,004 --> 01:26:08,787
The air of freedom.

949
01:26:09,202 --> 01:26:10,427
Own air.

950
01:26:10,870 --> 01:26:12,838
Air from others.

951
01:26:13,676 --> 01:26:15,498
Where everyone is attached.

952
01:26:15,842 --> 01:26:19,154
Dunderklumpen also wants
the treasure chest.

953
01:26:19,763 --> 01:26:23,092
And he also do not know
that there is no treasure.

954
01:26:25,001 --> 01:26:27,185
The only thing you see
is a stone.

955
01:26:29,943 --> 01:26:31,958
And you see a flower.

956
01:26:35,810 --> 01:26:37,888
And you see a bird feather.

957
01:26:42,370 --> 01:26:48,325
And the rest is air.
The treasure of a child.

958
01:26:55,751 --> 01:26:57,071
That's his money.

959
01:26:57,775 --> 01:27:00,900
No more and no less.

960
01:27:04,550 --> 01:27:05,438
Is he crying?

961
01:27:06,383 --> 01:27:08,902
So you see,
he's not so wrong and nasty.

962
01:27:10,435 --> 01:27:12,328
Is he really crying?

963
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:13,629
Is he crying?

964
01:27:13,928 --> 01:27:14,998
Yes!

965
01:27:15,811 --> 01:27:17,212
Of pure happiness.

966
01:27:17,423 --> 01:27:20,957
Elvira Fattigan,
you have the treasure chest?

967
01:27:21,355 --> 01:27:22,290
Yes!

968
01:27:22,894 --> 01:27:25,170
But there isn't any money in it.

969
01:27:26,953 --> 01:27:27,856
What?

970
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:29,635
There is no money in it?

971
01:27:31,221 --> 01:27:32,886
And there is no treasure either?

972
01:27:33,411 --> 01:27:36,627
Not a penny,
but there are treasures.

973
01:27:36,818 --> 01:27:38,881
There is a cute little stone.

974
01:27:39,302 --> 01:27:41,367
And a lovely little flower.

975
01:27:41,702 --> 01:27:44,019
And a wonderful feather.

976
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:50,225
And the air of joy and happiness
that gently blows around us.

977
01:27:53,798 --> 01:27:58,051
A cute little stone,
a lovely little flower,

978
01:27:59,088 --> 01:28:01,041
a wonderful feather

979
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:06,124
and the air of joy
and happiness

980
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:11,721
that fills all with gladness,
gladness, gladness.

981
01:28:12,895 --> 01:28:17,208
And then whiff a wind,
a joyous wind.

982
01:28:19,174 --> 01:28:20,637
Lucky wind.

983
01:28:22,642 --> 01:28:24,107
Lucky wind.

984
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:30,300
And Pellegnillot will be glad,

985
01:28:31,604 --> 01:28:36,168
I'll be glad, you'll be glad.

986
01:28:37,761 --> 01:28:43,092
You joyous wind whiff over me,
whiff over mountains, land and sea.

987
01:28:43,229 --> 01:28:47,012
Whiff through the world, a giant
pearl, blow you joyous wind.

988
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:50,989
Blow!

989
01:28:51,637 --> 01:28:58,381
A storm is blowing over Jorm.	
Joyous storm, joyous storm.

990
01:28:59,003 --> 01:29:06,344
A beautiful storm over Jorm.	
Joyous storm, joyous storm.

991
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:14,442
A beautiful storm over Jorm.	
Lucky storm, lucky storm.

992
01:29:14,730 --> 01:29:18,905
I reached her side, we nearly cried,
it got so bad we nearly died.

993
01:29:18,946 --> 01:29:22,558
We belt the wind, we shout and grin,
go blowing joyous wind.

994
01:29:22,997 --> 01:29:26,774
Blow!

995
01:29:26,816 --> 01:29:34,411
A storm is blowing over Jorm,	
over Jorm, over Jorm.

996
01:30:10,138 --> 01:30:12,864
A kindly wind to chase away
our fears.

997
01:30:13,907 --> 01:30:16,996
It is One Eye's turn,
come on step and dance.

998
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:20,612
A kindly wind to dry away
my tears.

999
01:30:21,814 --> 01:30:24,685
I'd like to have a turn
and here's my chance.

1000
01:30:26,061 --> 01:30:29,601
Blow!

1001
01:30:29,816 --> 01:30:36,993
A storm is blowing over Jorm,	
over Jorm, over Jorm.

1002
01:30:45,823 --> 01:30:49,490
Goodness knows it's really grand
a man can get to understand.

1003
01:30:49,641 --> 01:30:51,496
I tell you straight
I think it's great.

1004
01:30:51,571 --> 01:30:53,676
I have to stay you slow.

1005
01:30:54,101 --> 01:30:56,919
Blow!

1006
01:30:57,508 --> 01:31:04,667
A storm is blowing over Jorm,	
over Jorm, over Jorm.

1007
01:31:05,472 --> 01:31:08,051
Laughing and crying is healthy.

1008
01:31:08,793 --> 01:31:10,000
So healthy.

1009
01:31:10,813 --> 01:31:12,112
So healthy.

1010
01:31:13,166 --> 01:31:20,192
A storm blows over me,
over me, over me.

1011
01:31:21,042 --> 01:31:24,725
The magic of the midnight sun
is giving love to everyone.

1012
01:31:24,822 --> 01:31:28,798
Who wants to join is welcome,
we live just only once.

1013
01:31:28,832 --> 01:31:32,498
Blow!

1014
01:31:32,707 --> 01:31:39,984
A storm is blowing over Jorm,	
over Jorm, over Jorm.

1015
01:31:40,846 --> 01:31:42,039
Do you have the treasure chest,
Jens?

1016
01:31:43,619 --> 01:31:47,563
Daddy, imagine, Dunderklumpen
really brought those toys to life.

1017
01:31:49,265 --> 01:31:52,494
Yes. Look, the sun is rising.
They really know?
