00:00:00,778 --> 00:00:02,220
<i>So here's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

2
00:00:02,253 --> 00:00:04,183
<i>Sue framed Figgins</i>
<i>so she could take his job</i>

3
00:00:04,216 --> 00:00:05,910
<i>so now she's principal</i>
<i>and Becky's her Beckretary.</i>

4
00:00:05,943 --> 00:00:07,906
- BECKY: Get out, bitch!
- <i>Kurt started a cover band</i>

5
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:09,426
<i>called Pamela Lansbury</i>
<i>and Rachel's in it</i>

6
00:00:09,459 --> 00:00:12,031
<i>and so is Santana and so is</i>
<i>Dani and so is Elliot,</i>

7
00:00:12,064 --> 00:00:14,241
<i>who they also call Star Child</i>
<i>but his name's really Elliot.</i>

8
00:00:14,274 --> 00:00:15,677
KURT: Oh, my God, Star Child.

9
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,829
<i>Jake used to be a man-slut</i>
<i>but then he wasn't</i>

10
00:00:17,862 --> 00:00:20,411
<i>because he met Marley but then</i>
<i>he cheated on Marley with Bree</i>

11
00:00:20,452 --> 00:00:21,878
<i>which was so super mean</i>
<i>because Marley's so nice</i>

12
00:00:21,905 --> 00:00:23,151
<i>and Bree's so horrible</i>
<i>and it's like, geez,</i>

13
00:00:23,169 --> 00:00:25,046
<i>I guess he's a man-slut again.</i>
<i>That's so sad.</i>

14
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:27,637
UNIQUE: My Aunt Felicia always says,
"A tiger can't change his stripes."

15
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,181
<i>And that's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

16
00:00:30,602 --> 00:00:33,525
(all clamoring)

17
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:37,308
Hey, um, guys!

18
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:38,802
Guys... New Directions!

19
00:00:38,835 --> 00:00:39,876
New Directions!

20
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:41,725
Guys! Hey!

21
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:43,405
I just ran into Mr. Shue,
and he's gonna be stuck

22
00:00:43,438 --> 00:00:45,179
in his classroom for the
rest of the afternoon

23
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,094
because of some school board
inspection thing,

24
00:00:47,127 --> 00:00:49,364
but he still wanted us to meet so we can
start working on ideas for nationals.

25
00:00:49,405 --> 00:00:52,279
Beyoncé!
(all yelling over each other)

26
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,282
This is anarchy! We can't... we can't
all just shout at the same time.

27
00:01:01,564 --> 00:01:03,604
That's better.

28
00:01:03,637 --> 00:01:04,880
I have some ideas already.
I'm thinking

29
00:01:04,913 --> 00:01:06,648
that the music needs
to be really simple,

30
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:07,882
so we can really highlight
our voices.

31
00:01:07,917 --> 00:01:10,093
No guitars, or
nothing electronic.

32
00:01:10,126 --> 00:01:11,497
We go with
a simple piano arrangement.

33
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,311
Which I could play.

34
00:01:13,344 --> 00:01:14,879
I'm assuming
you're singing lead?

35
00:01:14,912 --> 00:01:17,884
Well, I am a senior,
and this is my last go at it.

36
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:19,425
We need to win this.

37
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:20,660
Well, feels like North Korea
up in here.

38
00:01:20,693 --> 00:01:22,400
Okay, forget the piano.

39
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:23,536
Forget all the music.

40
00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:26,378
We could just do, um, a
cappella, that always works.

41
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,397
Déjà Warblers. Should we wear
matching blazers, too?

42
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,239
Let's take it back...
What was wrong with the guitars?

43
00:01:30,272 --> 00:01:33,287
Nothing, why can't you guys
just stop resisting me

44
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,891
for a second,
and just go with me?

45
00:01:34,924 --> 00:01:36,460
Okay, Blaine Jong-il.

46
00:01:36,493 --> 00:01:38,768
- Yes! Blaine Jong-il
- I am not trying to be bossy.

47
00:01:38,801 --> 00:01:41,210
I am trying to give
the benefit of my experience.

48
00:01:41,243 --> 00:01:44,328
I have won more show choir
competitions than anyone in this room.

49
00:01:45,964 --> 00:01:46,933
(coughs): You suck.

50
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:50,956
A capella is worth a shot.

51
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:52,697
Let's do it.

52
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,810
- Thank you. - UNIQUE: Then you two can have
fun in your little barbershop couplet

53
00:01:55,838 --> 00:01:57,747
while the rest of us
discuss something good.

54
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,687
Fine. You don't want my help...

55
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:06,658
...then I am not gonna give it.

56
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:08,531
Looks like somebody's
man-struating.

57
00:02:08,564 --> 00:02:10,565
I heard that.

58
00:02:11,494 --> 00:02:14,463

59
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:16,183
Oh, good.

60
00:02:16,216 --> 00:02:17,519
We're all here.

61
00:02:17,552 --> 00:02:21,361
Thank you, Team Pamela Lansbury, for
assembling on such short notice.

62
00:02:21,402 --> 00:02:23,200
Okay, well, I rescheduled
my dialect session,

63
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:25,569
so what's up with
this emergency text?

64
00:02:25,602 --> 00:02:29,444
What's up is I just booked
our band's debut gig!

65
00:02:29,478 --> 00:02:30,741
(gasps) Amazing.

66
00:02:30,782 --> 00:02:31,477
Where? When?

67
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:36,666
This Thursday, 7:30 p.m., at the
Greenwich Village hot-spot Callbacks.

68
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:40,402
Ooh, NYADA's premier piano bar. Hold
on, isn't that a Broadway hangout?

69
00:02:40,435 --> 00:02:41,972
Well, traditionally, but
I talked to the manager,

70
00:02:42,005 --> 00:02:44,006
and he says that Thursdays are
kind of their dead nights.

71
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,478
So we can go in
and do whatever we want.

72
00:02:45,511 --> 00:02:46,911
No way, we cannot debut there.

73
00:02:46,944 --> 00:02:48,882
That is instant career suicide.

74
00:02:48,915 --> 00:02:50,988
Yeah, Kurt, look,
not to overstep,

75
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:53,060
but I-I follow a lot of bands
just starting out,

76
00:02:53,093 --> 00:02:55,328
and it's kind of all
about the launch.

77
00:02:55,361 --> 00:02:57,033
You know, getting music critics
out to see you,

78
00:02:57,066 --> 00:02:59,508
and that's a lot easier
with the right venue.

79
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:02,110
Oh, come on, Callbacks is
a real funky place.

80
00:03:02,143 --> 00:03:04,479
You know, they've got tons of history.
Yeah, but I can't think

81
00:03:04,512 --> 00:03:06,352
of a single band
that started out there.

82
00:03:06,385 --> 00:03:09,389
I mean, it's not like The Bitter
End or the Mercury Lounge, or...

83
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:10,757
Yeah, and if people
associate that place

84
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,662
with show tunes, nobody's
gonna come out for...

85
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:15,632
Our covers
of Madonna's greatest hits?

86
00:03:15,665 --> 00:03:17,031
I disagree, Dani.

87
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:19,671
Oh, so we're back
to the whole Madonna thing?

88
00:03:19,704 --> 00:03:21,104
Yes, it was my first impulse.

89
00:03:21,138 --> 00:03:24,344
Okay, look, guys, I know it's
untraditional, but you have to trust me.

90
00:03:24,377 --> 00:03:25,880
I was there at Callbacks.

91
00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:29,284
I saw it all, a vision
of perfect clarity.

92
00:03:29,317 --> 00:03:31,389
Every seat was occupied.

93
00:03:31,422 --> 00:03:33,620
A quiet hush fell
over the expectant crowd.

94
00:03:33,653 --> 00:03:36,356
As Pamela Lansbury made
their way to the stage,

95
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:41,935
and the opening notes of Madonna's 1985
single hit "Into the Groove" begin.

96
00:03:41,968 --> 00:03:44,368

the Groove" begins)

(phone ringing)

125
00:06:07,622 --> 00:06:09,492
Oh, it's my fiancé.

126
00:06:09,525 --> 00:06:10,260
Talk amongst yourselves.

127
00:06:10,293 --> 00:06:11,659
Hello?

128
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:14,091
Oh, can I just say
Glee Club sucks!

129
00:06:14,132 --> 00:06:15,427
Mr. Shue asked
for ideas for nationals.

130
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:20,296
And when I gave some genius ones, everyone
got all mad and started dissing me.

131
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:21,737
Maybe I came on too strong.

132
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,370
But since when is
that a bad thing?

133
00:06:23,403 --> 00:06:26,167
It's not, but you got to remember, at
McKinley everyone has an equal vote.

134
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,806
And if you come on too aggressively,
they might think you're a control-freak

135
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,838
or a puppet master.

136
00:06:32,438 --> 00:06:35,139
Anyway... I was gonna call you.

137
00:06:35,172 --> 00:06:36,938
Pamela Lansbury booked
its first gig.

138
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,713
And I know you were just here,

139
00:06:38,746 --> 00:06:41,175
but I was hoping you could come
cheer us on in the audience.

140
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,943
So, what do you say...
can I send you the deets?

141
00:06:42,976 --> 00:06:44,384
And a JetBlue voucher?

142
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:45,953
Uh, of course,
I wouldn't miss it.

143
00:06:45,986 --> 00:06:48,645
Wow, I can't believe anyone
would see me as controlling.

144
00:06:48,686 --> 00:06:49,653
You missed a spot.

145
00:06:49,686 --> 00:06:52,589
I'm doing the best I can, Sue.

146
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:55,018
You know, the way
you clean these floors

147
00:06:55,051 --> 00:06:57,553
is a perfect metaphor for
the way you ran this school.

148
00:06:57,586 --> 00:07:00,225
You did your best, but your
best just wasn't good enough.

149
00:07:00,258 --> 00:07:01,825
Look, I know you're upset

150
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:04,056
that the school board is coming
today to evaluate McKinley,

151
00:07:04,097 --> 00:07:07,628
and to determine if I'm worthy to
be instated as full-time principal.

152
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:10,294
And do you realize in my short
time as acting principal,

153
00:07:10,334 --> 00:07:12,430
test scores have risen 42%.

154
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,805
And my new caning policy has dropped both
absences and tardiness down to zero.

155
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:23,141
So, the truth is you should be cleaning
floors and I should be running schools.

156
00:07:23,174 --> 00:07:25,613
And if you would like
to continue cleaning floors

157
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:28,282
and feeding your family,
I suggest you do

158
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:31,683
everything you can to make sure
this place looks just amazing

159
00:07:31,716 --> 00:07:33,388
for this evaluation.

160
00:07:33,421 --> 00:07:35,156
They're in your office, Coach.

161
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,968
One last question
before we come back

162
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:44,971
for the official evaluation
later in the week.

163
00:07:45,004 --> 00:07:46,842
Why do you want
to be a principal?

164
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:50,041
Now, I know everyone wants to wear
the crown, but the fantasy of it

165
00:07:50,074 --> 00:07:51,871
can be quite different
from the reality.

166
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:56,577
Well, more than anyone I have ever
met, I was born to be in charge.

167
00:07:56,618 --> 00:07:57,583
Test scores are up.

168
00:07:57,617 --> 00:07:58,847
Kids are showing up.

169
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,216
Our sports teams are winning.

170
00:08:00,249 --> 00:08:01,817
Heck, even the Glee Club
is back competing

171
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,256
for the national title of clubs
no one really cares about.

172
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:08,156
And all of this is happening because
I can finally manifest my vision

173
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:10,859
without having to clear it
with some fool.

174
00:08:10,893 --> 00:08:13,323
You give me this school,
and in one year

175
00:08:13,356 --> 00:08:15,223
it will be the top school
in the state.

176
00:08:15,256 --> 00:08:16,256
I guarantee it.

177
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:18,161
I'm a champion, gentlemen.

178
00:08:18,194 --> 00:08:20,562
Let me be your champion.

179
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:25,032
We'll be back in a week.

180
00:08:25,065 --> 00:08:28,869
But between you and me, barring a
total catastrophe, you have my vote.

181
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:35,139
You certainly have a lot of
trophies, Principal Sylvester.

182
00:08:35,172 --> 00:08:39,012
Well, Superintendent Harris, you're
new in town, you may not be aware,

183
00:08:39,045 --> 00:08:41,519
but I am the only seven-time
national champion cheerleading coach

184
00:08:41,552 --> 00:08:42,520
in the country.

185
00:08:42,553 --> 00:08:44,952
Hmm, my wife used to watch those
competitions on television.

186
00:08:44,985 --> 00:08:47,590
Mm-hmm. Bugged the crap out of me
if I'm gonna be totally honest.

187
00:08:47,623 --> 00:08:48,989
Mmm.
(chuckles)

188
00:08:49,022 --> 00:08:50,759
- We're divorced.
- Oh.

189
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:51,696
Are you married?

190
00:08:51,729 --> 00:08:52,760
No, no.

191
00:08:52,793 --> 00:08:54,913
I married myself once, but I
don't think it was legal.

192
00:08:54,927 --> 00:08:55,693
(laughs)

193
00:08:55,726 --> 00:08:56,931
Yeah.

194
00:08:56,964 --> 00:08:58,592
We should go out
for a beer sometime.

195
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:02,865
Oh, are you sure that's
appropriate, Bob?

196
00:09:02,898 --> 00:09:05,200
I don't think anyone would see
a couple of guys going out

197
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:06,536
for a beer as anything shady.

198
00:09:06,569 --> 00:09:08,071
Besides I'm new in town.

199
00:09:08,103 --> 00:09:09,767
I'd like to find some
great dudes to hang out with.

200
00:09:09,807 --> 00:09:11,903
I-I'll call your office, okay?

201
00:09:11,936 --> 00:09:13,637
(grunts) (chuckles)

202
00:09:16,739 --> 00:09:21,717
I'm lactose intolerant, and
I may have to fart, Coach.

203
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,081
I don't look masculine,
do I, Becky?

204
00:09:24,114 --> 00:09:27,417
You have an allure
that goes beyond gender.

205
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,450
That's what I always say.

206
00:09:28,451 --> 00:09:32,890
I have to admit, while I find his hairline
highly suspicious for a man his age,

207
00:09:32,923 --> 00:09:37,327
that Bob Harris thinks I could star
in the sequel to <i>Boys Don't Cry,</i>

208
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,694
honestly, it kind
of bums me out.

209
00:09:39,727 --> 00:09:40,822
Maybe it's your clothes.

210
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,359
You could try on a skirt
every now and then.

211
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,463
No, you don't understand
the era I grew up in.

212
00:09:45,496 --> 00:09:47,303
I became a teacher
almost 30 years ago.

213
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,798
It was 1986.

214
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,103
It was a different time.

215
00:09:51,136 --> 00:09:53,904
<i>I tried being girly.</i>

216
00:09:53,945 --> 00:09:56,640
<i>But I found it hard to get</i>
<i>the respect I felt I deserved.</i>

217
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,277
Boys, no video games in school.

218
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,949
Who are you supposed to be?

219
00:10:00,982 --> 00:10:02,518
I'm the new cheerleading coach.

220
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:03,487
(laughs) Do you bop?

221
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,285
(both laugh)

222
00:10:05,318 --> 00:10:08,515
(Australian accent):
Get to class, mates.

223
00:10:08,548 --> 00:10:10,681
I've been trying to sound
like Crocodile Dundee.

224
00:10:10,721 --> 00:10:14,516
Word of advice new Cheerios!
Coach, Sue Sylvester.

225
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:16,883
Try some pants.

226
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:29,133
(opera music playing)

227
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:55,963
Get to class!

228
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,337
That new cheerleading coach
is one scary dude.

229
00:11:07,506 --> 00:11:11,685
The moment I put that track suit
on, the world bowed before me.

230
00:11:11,718 --> 00:11:14,421
I had one made in every color.

231
00:11:14,454 --> 00:11:15,884
Maybe it's time for a change,
Coach.

232
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,892
Everybody is scared of you now.

233
00:11:17,925 --> 00:11:20,061
It can't hurt
to girl it up a bit.

234
00:11:23,091 --> 00:11:24,856
(bell ringing)

235
00:11:27,161 --> 00:11:28,665
BRAD:
You're early.

236
00:11:28,698 --> 00:11:31,893
Geez! Oh, Brad! You scared
the crap out of me!

237
00:11:31,934 --> 00:11:33,563
Warn me before you talk!

238
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:36,665
I'm sorry, man.
I'm having a bad week.

239
00:11:36,698 --> 00:11:40,230
Tell me about it. I can't stop
playing online blackjack.

240
00:11:40,263 --> 00:11:42,595
I owe thousands of dollars
to some very sketchy people.

241
00:11:42,628 --> 00:11:44,096
Why doesn't anyone
listen to me?

242
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:45,863
I'm in 23 clubs!

243
00:11:45,896 --> 00:11:48,598
I probably would've been prom king if
this school didn't have so many stoners.

244
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:51,871
And what's wrong with having
a solid game plan?

245
00:11:51,904 --> 00:11:53,333
My house is getting
foreclosed on.

246
00:11:53,366 --> 00:11:57,070
And get this, my fiancé
called me a "Puppet Master!"

247
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,038
Well, if "pulling strings"

248
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:01,709
means that I encourage people to
reach their fullest potential,

249
00:12:01,742 --> 00:12:04,718
then, hell yeah,
guilty as charged!

250
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:09,947
Brad, if everyone just wants
me to sit down and shut up...

251
00:12:09,988 --> 00:12:12,784
that's exactly what
I'm gonna do.

252
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:16,985
I'm gonna be right back here
in the back corner.

253
00:12:17,025 --> 00:12:21,956
Believe me, that'll
send a message...

254
00:12:23,461 --> 00:12:26,599
- loud... - PUPPET TINA:
<i>Blainey Days!</i>

255
00:12:26,632 --> 00:12:27,926
Blainey Days, wake up!

256
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:30,363
We're sorry we didn't listen
to you earlier.

257
00:12:30,396 --> 00:12:31,829
Yeah, dawg. Our bad, yo!

258
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,871
I'd love to say something really bitchy
or even downright cruel, but I can't,

259
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:37,837
because you're clearly the most
talented teenager at this school!

260
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,404
On this planet! Yeah, that's why
we're best friends, even though

261
00:12:40,445 --> 00:12:43,140
I'm straight and you're gay
and I'm blond and you're gay.

262
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,507
May the Force be with you.

263
00:12:44,548 --> 00:12:45,978
Kids, I've got an awesome idea!

264
00:12:46,011 --> 00:12:50,388
This week's lesson is all about the
most inspiring guy we know: Blaine!

265
00:12:50,421 --> 00:12:52,252
(all cheer)

266
00:12:52,286 --> 00:12:54,253
Ooh, child,
Unique's got the blues!

267
00:12:54,294 --> 00:12:56,022
And the only way to cure 'em

268
00:12:56,063 --> 00:12:57,590
is to hear Blaine's
smooth-as-a-baby's-butt voice!

269
00:12:57,631 --> 00:12:59,125
Please, Blaine!

270
00:12:59,158 --> 00:13:01,534
Please?
Please?

271
00:13:01,568 --> 00:13:02,568
Yeah, Blaine!

272
00:13:02,601 --> 00:13:03,305
Really?

273
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:07,609
Well, if you guys insist.
What should I sing?

274
00:13:07,642 --> 00:13:08,943
Oh, I know. Hit it!

275

Blainey Days, Blainey Days,
what's wrong with you?

299
00:15:11,186 --> 00:15:12,921
Yeah, dude, you didn't say
a word the entire class.

300
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:13,921
Didn't even sing.

301
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,257
You want us to call you
a waaambulance?

302
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,488
'Cause your pity party
is out of control.

303
00:15:17,521 --> 00:15:20,761
Yeah, girl, check yourself
before you wreck yourself!

304
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,324
And again. Five, six, seven, eight.
Go one, two... four.

305
00:15:32,357 --> 00:15:33,356
Six, eight.

306
00:15:33,397 --> 00:15:35,228
Sharper. Two, three,
here it comes.

307
00:15:35,261 --> 00:15:37,196
Make sure we land.

308
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:40,190
Oh, God, okay, I've seen enough.
Everyone stop.

309
00:15:40,216 --> 00:15:42,583
Look, I'm gonna do
you guys a favor. You suck,

310
00:15:42,624 --> 00:15:44,319
and I can't be bothered
to keep wasting my time.

311
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,688
Hit the showers and get focused.

312
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:49,225
Please, tomorrow,
we are doing 540s.

313
00:15:56,765 --> 00:15:57,867
Oh, my God, her, too?

314
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,330
All of them, actually.

315
00:16:03,267 --> 00:16:06,304
Jake, hey, uh, listen,
I just wanted to say thanks

316
00:16:06,335 --> 00:16:08,239
for sticking up for me
in Glee Club.

317
00:16:08,272 --> 00:16:10,144
Sometimes I feel like
I'm the only one

318
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,809
that cares about pushing us
so we can nail it, you know?

319
00:16:12,842 --> 00:16:16,080
Yeah, I know, I mean, I'm
getting pretty sick of it, too.

320
00:16:16,113 --> 00:16:18,383
Um, I don't know how else
to say this, but...

321
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,257
there's something's going on
in the choir room.

322
00:16:20,286 --> 00:16:24,713
I don't know if it's haunted or
like a space-time rift happening,

323
00:16:24,746 --> 00:16:29,759
but trust me, do yourself a
favor, sit in the back corner.

324
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:33,970
It's crazy.

325
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,045
Dance has never been our strong
suit, but I think with Jake's help,

326
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:40,909
we can really kick it
up a notch. Jake?

327
00:16:40,942 --> 00:16:42,109
What's the point?

328
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:43,316
I'm sorry?

329
00:16:43,349 --> 00:16:45,780
Seriously, what is the point?

330
00:16:45,813 --> 00:16:48,317
I could choreograph a sick
dance, none of you can keep up.

331
00:16:48,351 --> 00:16:51,422
I mean, half of you can't even
do it and won't even try. Why?

332
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,485
Because you're not dancers.

333
00:16:52,526 --> 00:16:54,590
So let's not waste my time.

334
00:16:54,623 --> 00:16:57,861
Let's just do another cut-and-paste dance
routine that even Tina can pick up.

335
00:16:57,895 --> 00:16:59,597
You are such a conceited jerk.

336
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,133
I'm not conceited, I'm bored.

337
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,868
Please, we've seen
your dance moves.

338
00:17:04,901 --> 00:17:06,037
They're fine, not epic.

Excuse me, Miss Alfano.

380
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:56,971
As much as I've really enjoyed learning
about yarn these past three months,

381
00:19:57,004 --> 00:19:59,970
I was wondering, since Arts and
Crafts is my senior elective,

382
00:20:00,003 --> 00:20:03,272
if maybe I could do my own
thing and venture into felt

383
00:20:03,306 --> 00:20:06,242
and fabric and even
yarn and make a puppet?

384
00:20:06,275 --> 00:20:08,312
Your request surely begs
the question,

385
00:20:08,345 --> 00:20:13,349
"Why on earth would an 18-year-old
man want to make a puppet?"

386
00:20:13,382 --> 00:20:16,810
Well... it's not just any puppet...
It's a puppet of my fiancé.

387
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:19,585
We're 600 miles apart, and even though
I get to see him tomorrow night,

388
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:20,914
I'd really like
to see him right now,

389
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:23,152
even though it might be
only in my imagination.

390
00:20:23,185 --> 00:20:25,852
Fine. Make a puppet.

391
00:20:28,251 --> 00:20:30,051
May I experiment with découpage?

392
00:20:30,084 --> 00:20:30,820
No.

393
00:20:34,328 --> 00:20:36,230
I forgave myself
a long time ago.

394
00:20:36,263 --> 00:20:38,701
I think it's time
I forgive you now.

395
00:20:38,734 --> 00:20:41,599
You are right.
Please forgive me.

396
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:44,606
In this argument, I don't have
a leg to stand on.

Hey, Principal... uh, Coach.

400
00:20:58,655 --> 00:21:02,453
Um, geez, are you okay?
Oh, what's with the shoes?

401
00:21:02,486 --> 00:21:04,123
Man, you have big feet.

402
00:21:04,156 --> 00:21:07,794
Well, I'm sorry if my femininity
threatens you. What is that?

403
00:21:07,827 --> 00:21:10,291
Did you just touch me
with a puppet?

404
00:21:10,332 --> 00:21:12,026
Oh, I made it in Crafts class.

405
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:13,294
Get that thing out of here!

406
00:21:13,327 --> 00:21:14,829
I don't ever want
to see that thing

407
00:21:14,862 --> 00:21:17,891
in my hallway again! What?
You can't just ban puppets.

408
00:21:17,932 --> 00:21:19,659
Are you saying that
because of the shoes?

409
00:21:19,699 --> 00:21:21,425
Are you less afraid of me?

410
00:21:21,466 --> 00:21:25,029
In a few days' time
I am going to be evaluated

411
00:21:25,062 --> 00:21:26,764
on my abilities
to run this school.

412
00:21:26,797 --> 00:21:29,237
If the school board comes here
and sees schizophrenic students

413
00:21:29,268 --> 00:21:30,908
clearly off their meds
talking to puppets,

414
00:21:30,931 --> 00:21:33,297
they are gonna think I don't
have a handle on things.

415
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,168
Well... Hey, hey! Kurt puppet!

416
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:37,440
This is contraband. And if
I catch you with your hand

417
00:21:37,473 --> 00:21:40,702
up the butt of anything that isn't
human, you're in a world of trouble.

418
00:21:40,735 --> 00:21:42,806
But... Be careful.

419
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:45,805
(grunts) Damn it!

420
00:22:08,314 --> 00:22:09,817
Sue, I... look,
I-I'm trying to work.

421
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,051
Do you mind coming back in,
like, an hour to barge in here

422
00:22:12,085 --> 00:22:14,495
- without knocking and start insulting
me for no reason? - Oh, sure, sure, pal.

423
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,063
I just, uh, I want to ask
you a question first.

424
00:22:16,096 --> 00:22:18,433
Um... you're an oddly
feminine man.

425
00:22:18,466 --> 00:22:19,666
What?

426
00:22:19,699 --> 00:22:21,605
Oh, please, you just
literally did a pirouette.

427
00:22:21,638 --> 00:22:24,078
Sue, just because a guy can dance
doesn't make him effeminate.

428
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,544
That's what I'm saying.
When you dance, somehow

429
00:22:26,577 --> 00:22:28,879
you're able to maintain
your manliness.

430
00:22:28,912 --> 00:22:31,048
Here's the thing:

431
00:22:31,081 --> 00:22:35,954
Um... I happen to have a sizeable crush
on the handsomest man in the universe,

432
00:22:35,995 --> 00:22:37,426
Superintendent Bob Harris.

433
00:22:37,459 --> 00:22:39,164
I've had multiple
conversations with him.

434
00:22:39,197 --> 00:22:45,499
In fact, several days ago, I was quite
certain he was flirting with me.

435
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:49,134
But it turns out all this
time he thought I was a man.

436
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:52,037
I blame the Johnny Cash song,
"A Boy Named Sue."

437
00:22:54,343 --> 00:22:56,110
You know what they used
to say about Ginger Rogers?

438
00:22:56,143 --> 00:22:57,077
No.

439
00:22:57,111 --> 00:22:59,574
That she could lead her partner while
dancing backwards in high heels.

440
00:22:59,615 --> 00:23:02,647
I have no idea how that is
germane to this conversation.

441
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,648
Ginger Rogers was
the pinnacle of femininity.

442
00:23:04,689 --> 00:23:07,782
I mean, she was one of the most
famous dancers in the world,

443
00:23:07,823 --> 00:23:11,624
and her partner was Fred Astaire, maybe
the greatest dancer of all time.

444
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:14,126
Again, I don't know how this
pertains to what I'm talking about.

445
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,526
The point is, Ginger Rogers did
everything Fred Astaire did...

446
00:23:17,567 --> 00:23:20,304
only she did it backwards
and in high heels.

447
00:23:20,337 --> 00:23:23,673
I mean, she managed to find a
way to be feminine and strong.

448
00:23:23,706 --> 00:23:26,606
Half the time when it looked like
Fred Astaire was leading her?

449
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:27,638
She was leading him.

450
00:23:27,671 --> 00:23:29,142
Okay.
Tell you what.

451
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:30,078
Let's make a deal.

452
00:23:30,111 --> 00:23:33,342
I'll teach you to lead while
dancing backwards in high heels,

453
00:23:33,382 --> 00:23:37,444
and you give me the $600 I need
for new costumes at nationals.

454
00:23:37,485 --> 00:23:39,882
Nope.
Forget it.

455
00:23:39,915 --> 00:23:41,346
I'm sorry, there's no way
in hell I'm going to give

456
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:42,555
the Glee Club more
money for costumes

457
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,556
until you can explain
to me how you paid for

458
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:48,658
that 18-cubic-foot inflatable Lady Gaga
airbag that you strapped onto the back

459
00:23:48,691 --> 00:23:49,826
of the crippled
kid's wheelchair.

460
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:52,129
That was at least
$1,000 right there, William.

461
00:23:52,162 --> 00:23:54,099
Fine.

462
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:55,132

Jacob X. Puckerman, you were

Crystal.

574
00:30:55,662 --> 00:30:57,958

we could use this time

a little better.

576
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:03,341
We could sit in a circle on

00:31:03,374 --> 00:31:04,741
about our core wounds.

578
00:31:04,774 --> 00:31:06,573
Or you shut your hole.

But that was totally
inappropriate.

Please come sit with me.

585
00:31:25,198 --> 00:31:26,997
Sometimes I fly off the handle.

586
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:30,533
Like yesterday, when I taped
Dottie's buns together.

587
00:31:30,566 --> 00:31:32,206
I did it for my old man.

588
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:34,175
I wanted him to think
I was cool.

589
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:36,309
That's really heavy, Becky.
Thanks for sharing.

590
00:31:36,342 --> 00:31:38,141
What's going on with <i>you,</i>
Blaine?

591
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:43,315
Well, to tell the truth, guys, I
feel really, really guilty about

592
00:31:43,348 --> 00:31:44,916
missing Kurt's show in New York.

593
00:31:44,949 --> 00:31:47,750
Why? It's a stupid
cover band.

594
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:51,487
And, dude, you go to New York all the
time... you were just there last week.

595
00:31:51,528 --> 00:31:53,893
True. But Kurt needs me.

596
00:31:53,926 --> 00:31:57,197
- We all need you, because
you are so awesome. - Yeah,

597
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,997
you're America's gay sweetheart.

598
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,334
Thanks, guys.

599
00:32:00,367 --> 00:32:02,703
You guys are, like,
my only real friends.

600
00:32:02,736 --> 00:32:05,168
But we're not real;
we're puppets.

601
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:07,038
Maybe that's a bad thing.

602
00:32:07,071 --> 00:32:09,407
Maybe the fact that I can
only really feel like myself

603
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,481
with friends I can
totally control is keeping me

604
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:14,512
from really feeling like
I'm close to anyone.

605
00:32:14,553 --> 00:32:18,354
<i>Maybe</i> it's indicative
of a deeper intimacy issue.

606
00:32:18,387 --> 00:32:20,657
Or <i>maybe</i> everyone
should just wise up

607
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:24,483
and start doing everything you se, because
you are so right on all the time.

608
00:32:24,524 --> 00:32:25,755
By the way, did
you notice you're

609
00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:27,829

outside the choir room?

610
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,262
That's not normal.

611
00:32:29,295 --> 00:32:31,231
Seriously, you might
want to get a CAT scan.

612
00:32:31,264 --> 00:32:33,000
(knocking)

613
00:32:33,033 --> 00:32:34,372
Hello, hello.
Wake up. Hey.

614
00:32:34,405 --> 00:32:36,245
Will you cover for me, please?
I've got to leave early.

615
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:38,380
Uh, y-yeah, sure. Why?

616
00:32:38,413 --> 00:32:40,581
It's not important. Later.

617
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,720
Hey, so, are you ready to go?

618
00:32:45,753 --> 00:32:49,558
No need. The crimson tide
is rolling again.

619
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,293
I got my period.

620
00:32:52,326 --> 00:32:53,589
I'm not pregnant.

621
00:32:53,629 --> 00:32:57,195
I guess I was just
late... this month.

622
00:32:57,228 --> 00:32:59,330
Are you serious?
That's awesome news.

623
00:32:59,363 --> 00:33:01,433
(exhales) Oh, I am so relieved.
<i>You're</i> relieved?

624
00:33:01,466 --> 00:33:04,499
Why? I was the one who had
to go to the doctor visit.

00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,667
No, I just mean that I'm
relieved that the whole thing

626
00:33:06,707 --> 00:33:08,803

for the both of us.

627
00:33:08,843 --> 00:33:13,916
(sighs) Let me hit you with the blunt
instrument of reality, Puckerman.

628
00:33:13,949 --> 00:33:17,451

another as long as he lives.

630
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:24,587
One of these days, you are gonna
knock someone up, and I feel bad

631
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,592

that shares your DNA.

633
00:33:30,424 --> 00:33:32,128
To who?

634
00:33:32,161 --> 00:33:34,464
Your seven kids
by seven different women?

635
00:33:35,496 --> 00:33:38,499
Not unless you change.

636
00:33:38,532 --> 00:33:41,866
Bree, look, I'm sorry, okay? I know
this whole thing was really scary

637
00:33:41,899 --> 00:33:45,597
- and traumatic... - Just do me a favor
and stay away from me from now on.

638
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,629
You're toxic.

639
00:33:57,561 --> 00:33:58,967
Little known fact?

640
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,135
McKinley saved a bundle on new
lockers by using recycled metal.

641
00:34:02,168 --> 00:34:04,334
These lockers
are actually Kalashnikovs

642
00:34:04,367 --> 00:34:08,338
that were melted down
during the war in Chechnya.

643
00:34:08,371 --> 00:34:14,478
(clears throat) Uh, Principal Sylvester, Yes.
I owe you an apology. I...

644
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:20,380
I get in "business mode," and I may not
be that observant, so I... Well, I...

645
00:34:20,421 --> 00:34:23,222
might've overlooked
your more... feminine side.

646
00:34:23,255 --> 00:34:25,221
Oh. No worries, Superintendant.

647
00:34:25,254 --> 00:34:26,294
No worries.

648
00:34:26,959 --> 00:34:27,758
Please.

649
00:34:30,155 --> 00:34:35,156
(clicks tongue) And this... is the choir
room of McKinley's pride and joy,

650
00:34:35,189 --> 00:34:39,224
our national championship glee
club, the New Directions.

651
00:34:39,257 --> 00:34:43,828
Attention, McKinley School Board,
Sue Sylvester has put our children

652
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,502
in grave danger.

653
00:34:45,535 --> 00:34:47,776
There is a gas leak in this room

654
00:34:47,809 --> 00:34:52,145
that is a direct result of Sue
Sylvester's failed leadership!

655
00:34:52,178 --> 00:34:56,646
No, there <i>was</i> a gas leak in
this room, but I fixed it.

656
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,487
(whirring)

657
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,058
<i>I know a gas-induced</i>
<i>fantasy dance sequence</i>

658
00:35:01,091 --> 00:35:03,550
<i>when I experience one.</i>

659
00:35:03,591 --> 00:35:07,250
And despite the fact that facilities
management is under your jurisdiction,

660
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:11,426
Janitor Figgins, I found the
problem, I corrected it

661
00:35:11,459 --> 00:35:13,732
and now I'm cutting your pay
in half.

662
00:35:13,765 --> 00:35:16,467
WOMAN: Principal Sylvester,
we've seen enough.

663
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,809
Yours is precisely the type
of leadership this school needs.

664
00:35:19,842 --> 00:35:22,548
The board would like to make you
principal on a permanent basis.

665
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:24,043
Oh!
(chuckles)

666
00:35:24,084 --> 00:35:25,547
Congratulations, Sue.

667
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,149
Oh, thank you so
much, Superintendant.

668
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:31,083
How about we go out
and celebrate?

669
00:35:31,124 --> 00:35:32,187
Excuse me?

670
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,492
Would you like to go out
on a date with me?

671
00:35:34,525 --> 00:35:36,293
Um... no.

672
00:35:37,294 --> 00:35:38,365
I don't want to do that.

673
00:35:38,398 --> 00:35:39,261
(coughs)

674
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:45,336
Am I okay?

675
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:49,481
I mean, is this what it feels
like to be losing your mind?

676
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:50,680
I'm unraveling.

677
00:35:50,713 --> 00:35:52,343
I feel like Mel Gibson
in <i>The Beaver.</i>

678
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:55,845
(high-pitched): More like
Mel Gibson in <i>Mad Max,</i>

679
00:35:55,879 --> 00:35:59,713
with your abs and your...
leather.

680
00:35:59,746 --> 00:36:00,983
Wait, what leather?

681
00:36:01,016 --> 00:36:02,815
The leather I was
imagining you in

682
00:36:02,848 --> 00:36:10,154
when I was rubbing vapor cream all
over your smooth... hairless... chest.

683
00:36:10,187 --> 00:36:13,153
(chuckling):
Tina, I'm engaged.

684
00:36:13,186 --> 00:36:16,821
- Hey, what's going on? - Uh... nothing.
I'm-I'm just, um, cleaning my head out.

685
00:36:16,854 --> 00:36:18,316
Just trying to figure
some stuff out.

686
00:36:18,357 --> 00:36:19,284
Is that supposed to be me?

687
00:36:19,325 --> 00:36:22,323
What?! That's...
that-that's crazy.

688
00:36:22,356 --> 00:36:24,859
She has Asian eyes
and my exact dress.

689
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:26,227
Total coincidence.

690
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,730
Not everything
is about you, Tina.

691
00:36:28,763 --> 00:36:30,226
What do you want?

692
00:36:30,266 --> 00:36:32,529
I just wanted to let you know
that everybody feels bad.

693
00:36:32,562 --> 00:36:34,865
We spent pretty much the
whole Glee session discussing

694
00:36:34,899 --> 00:36:37,571
how much pressure you're under
with nationals, graduation...

695
00:36:37,604 --> 00:36:40,981
The engagement. You were just trying to
exert some control. And the truth is,

696
00:36:41,014 --> 00:36:42,907
you should have some.
You've earned it.

697
00:36:42,948 --> 00:36:46,405
Sam suggested you should have the lead
on one of the songs at nationals.

698
00:36:46,446 --> 00:36:48,613
So we took a vote
and it was unanimous.

699
00:36:48,646 --> 00:36:51,677
Piano, a capella,
whatever you think is right.

700
00:36:51,718 --> 00:36:54,043
- Thanks, Tina.
- Of course.

701
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:56,051
So if you're done being
a puppet master,

702
00:36:56,084 --> 00:36:58,421
do you think you could take your
hand out from under my dress?

703
00:36:58,454 --> 00:37:01,652
- Um...
- Yeah.

704
00:37:01,693 --> 00:37:04,830
- Um... - It's okay.
- Sorry about that.

705
00:37:04,864 --> 00:37:05,727
Thanks.

706
00:37:06,464 --> 00:37:09,502
I'm gonna miss having
a Kurt puppet though.

707
00:37:09,535 --> 00:37:11,799
He did anything I said.

708
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,408
(high-pitched):
Anything?

709
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:16,239
All right, settle down, Puppet Tina.
Okay. I get it. Blainey Days...

710
00:37:16,272 --> 00:37:19,248
Marley. Marley, Marley, please.

711
00:37:19,281 --> 00:37:20,713
Please just
listen. Please.

712
00:37:20,746 --> 00:37:22,547
30 seconds. Go.

713
00:37:22,588 --> 00:37:24,482
I miss you.

714
00:37:24,523 --> 00:37:25,818
Every minute of every day.

715
00:37:25,851 --> 00:37:28,227
And I know that I screwed
things up really badly,

716
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,660
and I'm sorry. I know what I lost and
I know that I can't be without you.

717
00:37:31,693 --> 00:37:34,101
I need you. I don't want
to be this jerk anymore,

718
00:37:34,134 --> 00:37:36,797
and you are the only one who can
make me a better person.

719
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:39,133
A good person.
I'm not here to fix you, Jake.

720
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:41,668
I know, I know, I know.
That's why I'm here.

721
00:37:41,709 --> 00:37:44,941
To make it right, to make it
better, to make me better.

722
00:37:44,974 --> 00:37:49,615
I'm sorry, but we gave it a try and it...
just wasn't right.

723
00:37:49,648 --> 00:37:54,954
So after all that... you're saying
you don't have any feelings for me?

724
00:37:54,995 --> 00:37:56,995
(sighs)

725
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:03,837
I think that you're
a good friend and teammate...

726
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:06,942
Marley... but I just don't
feel the same as you.

727
00:38:06,975 --> 00:38:09,340
Not anymore.

728
00:38:09,373 --> 00:38:10,843
Marley, please.

729
00:38:11,675 --> 00:38:13,306
I got to get to class.

730
00:38:13,347 --> 00:38:15,212
I'll see you later in Glee Club.

731
00:38:18,985 --> 00:38:20,990
(school bell rings)

732
00:38:25,076 --> 00:38:27,397
Look, I know we don't know why
Kurt called this meeting.

733
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,597
It's probably
to retire the band,

734
00:38:28,631 --> 00:38:30,511
but we can't rub it in and say,
"I told you so."

735
00:38:30,535 --> 00:38:31,502
That would be devastating.

736
00:38:31,535 --> 00:38:34,839
Well, I wouldn't do that, and I'm not gonna
let Kurt disband Pamela Lansbury.

737
00:38:34,872 --> 00:38:37,143
Look, I might not agree
with all of his decisions,

738
00:38:37,176 --> 00:38:39,407
but he is our leader
and he's an artist,

739
00:38:39,448 --> 00:38:41,709
and artists should be allowed
to fail.

740
00:38:41,742 --> 00:38:43,381
KURT:
Who says we failed?

741
00:38:43,414 --> 00:38:44,880
Cronuts, anyone?

742
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:46,089
RACHEL:
Hi.

743
00:38:46,122 --> 00:38:48,153
Oh, this? No big deal.

744
00:38:48,186 --> 00:38:52,060
Just a little token from the booking
agency of the Williamsburg Music Hall,

745
00:38:52,093 --> 00:38:54,533
which is the location
of our second gig!

746
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:56,196
What? Are you serious?

747
00:38:56,237 --> 00:38:59,835
- How? - Okay, true, we only had one
audience member at our last show,

748
00:38:59,868 --> 00:39:01,604
but it happened to be the
right audience member

749
00:39:01,637 --> 00:39:05,043
because, not only was he
a devoted Angela Lansbury fan,

750
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:07,908
but he also liked what he saw,
made a secret bootleg

751
00:39:07,949 --> 00:39:10,349
and passed it along
to his nephew, who works at

752
00:39:10,383 --> 00:39:13,149
the Williamsburg Music Hall. The Williamsburg
Music Hall, which also just happens to be...

753
00:39:13,182 --> 00:39:14,748
One of the hottest venues
in Brooklyn.

754
00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:16,285
Good work, fearless leader.

755
00:39:16,318 --> 00:39:20,094
Well, it wasn't just me. It was...
also a lot of luck and-and you guys.

756
00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:23,795
Because, you know, whether Pamela
Lansbury implodes or explodes,

757
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:26,133
I really have to thank you guys
for sticking by me.

758
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:28,067
(knocking)

759
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,929
Uh, package for Kurt Hummel.

760
00:39:29,962 --> 00:39:33,141
(grunts) Okay.

761
00:39:33,174 --> 00:39:35,204
KURT: Thank you. Thank you.

762
00:39:35,237 --> 00:39:37,204
Oh, it's from Blaine.

763
00:39:37,245 --> 00:39:40,815
He sends a gift to say sorry for missing
the performance the other night.

764
00:39:40,848 --> 00:39:41,912
RACHEL:
That's so nice!

765
00:39:44,286 --> 00:39:47,318
Okay, that is creepy as hell.

766
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:48,917
Is there one for each of us?

767
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:53,722
Guys, I just wanted
to apologize to all of you.

768
00:39:53,755 --> 00:39:57,594
I've been a little bit controlling
lately and it's not cool.

769
00:39:57,627 --> 00:40:01,132
I've made some changes though
and I've learned that sometimes

770
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:03,667
you just need to let go.

771
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,737
Cut the strings, so to speak.

772
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,632
I bet you'll still
be bossy as hell.

773
00:40:07,665 --> 00:40:09,432
Actually, I hope to
be more of a leader,

774
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:11,473
as opposed to being
just bossy, Kitty.

775
00:40:11,506 --> 00:40:14,612
So to celebrate this new
laissez-faire Blaine,

776
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:19,055
I've made some felt
peace offerings.

777
00:40:20,657 --> 00:40:21,488
Voila.

778
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:22,854
- What?
- Whoa!

779
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:24,255
It has glasses!

780
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,834
(indistinct chatter)

781
00:40:26,867 --> 00:40:27,866
I think we look alike.

782
