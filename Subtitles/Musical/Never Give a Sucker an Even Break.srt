How are you, Chuck?

3
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,760
Hello, Gorgeous.
Oh, say, your daughter's
looking for you.

4
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,497
Oh, thanks.
I'll take the next bus.

5
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,696
OK, Gorgeous.

6
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:53,239
Oh, hello, Mother.
Who're you doubling today?

7
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,974
Lydia Flickham
in an aerial act.

8
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,140
Be careful.

9
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:57,808
Say, I thought you were
supposed to be rehearsing.

10
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,613
I haven't even started yet.

11

Well, you knock them over
in that rehearsal
and I'll let you support me.

Uncle Bill said if he sells

We owe him too much already.

You're about to fall heir
to a kitten's stocking.

20
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,552
What's a kitten's stocking?

21
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,494
A sock on the puss.

22
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,498

All five of them
hit me at once.

Hi.

32
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,816
It's a lucky thing
I recognized you.

33
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,513
I thought it was that guy
coming back again.

34
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:45,689
I was about to
clout your brains out.

35
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:48,124
How about a part
in this new picture
you're gonna do?

36
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,594
Go away or I'll kill you.

37
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,997
You're alright.
You're all set.

38
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,693
Thank you, Mr. Fields.

39
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,826
How would you
like to hide the egg

40
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:01,465
and gurgitate a few
saucers of mocha java?

41
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,509
No, thanks.
I've just had breakfast.

42
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:08,377
Oh, you have, eh?
Well, call me up at
sometime at the house.

43

What time?

44
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,443
Oh, a couple o'clock.

45
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,923
Good morning, beautiful.

What do you hear
from Garcia?

47
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,135
A ringer!

48
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:34,835
Got a menu?

49
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,143
Thank you. Thank you.

50
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,920
Is there any goulash
on this menu?

51
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,525
That's roast beef gravy.
Oh, it's roast beef gravy.

52
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,691
Is that steak
New York cut?

53
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:11,266
What about...

54
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:29,894
No extra charge
for the cold shower, I hope.

55
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,964
Do you think
it's too hot for pork chops?

56
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,129
Oh.

57
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:46,738
That practically eliminates
everything but ham and eggs.

58
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,381
Forgot about that.

59
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,683
No ham?

60
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,687
Two fomented eggs in a glass.

61
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,194
Cup.

62
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:05,428
Yes. Cup.

63
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,363
And some whole wheat...

64
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:08,661
White.

65
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:11,601
Some white bread, yes.

66
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,940
And a... Get away from there.

67
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:19,004
And a cup of
mocha java with cream.

68
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:20,409
Milk.

69
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,710
Milk. Yes, that's fine.

70
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,545
Two in the water, easy!

71
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:27,245
I don't know
why I ever come in here.

72
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:29,977
Flies get
the best of everything.

73
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,023
Go away. Go away.
Get away. Go on.

Alright.
Thank you, Mr. Pangborn.

100
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:14,247
And another thing,
you're always squawking
about something.

101
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,185
If it isn't the steak,
it's something else.

102
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,689
I didn't squawk
about the steak, dear.

103
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,192
I merely said
I didn't see that old horse

104
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,751
that used to be
tethered outside here.

105

You're as funny
as a cry for help.

106
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:32,203
You also pulled that old gag
about breaking your fork
in the gravy.

107
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,503
I didn't say anything
about breaking the fork
in the gravy.

112

of the insult?

118
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,437
That'll be 35 cents.

119
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,536
Thirty-five cents.
Thank you.

120
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,908
Have you any
imported cigars?

121
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,645
Stingaroos. Four for a nickel.

122
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,586
Oh, that's fine
as long as they're imported.

123
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:29,084
You know, if anybody
ever comes in here
and gives you a $10 tip,

124
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,828
scrutinize it carefully

125
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:35,366
because there's a lot of
counterfeit money
going around.

126
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:38,767
I'll give you the dough.
Don't... Here. There.

127
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:42,934
If I get any counterfeit
nickels or pennies,
I'll know where they came from.

128
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,401
You're so clever.

129
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:47,506
Who told you I was clever?

130
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,445
All your friends
at the studio told me.

131
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:52,916
Oh, drat! I told them
not to tell you.

132
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,443
And another thing.
Don't be so free
with your hands.

133
00:10:56,522 --> 00:11:01,186
Listen, honey, I was only
trying to guess your weight.

134
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,863

called that for two days.

I suffered from
high blood pressure for years.

138
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,538
Then I lost my dough
and I had to give it up.

139
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,443
Very comical.

140
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,650
Look at that hat.
It's nice. That's fine.

141
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,207

00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,674

00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,408

00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:53,536
Your hat.

00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:56,775
Oh!

146
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,880
Thanks 1,000 times, yes.

147
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:01,980

00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,332
They only have to stop
while we rehearse.

175
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,130
Now, I'll give you
one whistle for quiet and
two whistles to resume work.

176
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,864
Is that OK,
Mr. Pangborn?

177
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,132
Well...

178
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,435
Quiet!

179
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,012
This...

180
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,191
This is not the song
that you are to sing.

181
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,922
This is the song
Uncle Bill told me to sing.

182
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:25,821
Uncle who?

183
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:26,956
Mr. Fields.

184
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:28,627
Swish swash.

185
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:32,426
This is the number
that you are to sing.

186
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:33,927
Alright...

187
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,403

190
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:57,018
Why do I have to work
on a stage as busy as this

191
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,690
with 48 stages
in this studio?

192
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:01,762
I'm sorry, Mr. Pangborn,

193
00:15:01,994 --> 00:15:02,658

194
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,669
I don't like this song.

195
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:06,861

00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:24,506
You smoke vile cigars all day

Drown in a vat of whiskey?
"Death, where is thy sting?"

00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:40,263
Thank you.
Shortest interview on record.

I beg your pardon.
What did you say?

265
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:45,998
I have an engagement

00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,095
What was the name?

267
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:49,197
W. C. Bill Fields.

268
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:51,765
Glad to know you, Mr. Fields.
- Glad to know you.

269
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:53,242
Step right into my office.

270
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,246
Yes, I will, too.

271
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:57,738
Oh, I'm sorry.

272
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,216
Well, that's... Well...
- Excuse me.

00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:07,448
Well, watch your step here.

00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:22,766
Oh!

00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,142
Hello, dear.

278
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:27,001
Pardon me, Mr. Fields.

279
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:30,571
But my wife is not going to be
dragged in and out of your picture

280
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:32,173
by the hair of her head.

281
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,808
Of course,
this is only a rough draft.

282
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:36,547
You've got to
bear with me a half a tick.

283
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:40,079
And you'll have to take
that crab net off, dear.

284
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,790
Here's one of the scenes.
Do you mind being seated?

285
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:45,920
Oh, oh, no. My dear.

286

Yeah, a small beard,

294
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,986
Just little... You know what
a Vandyke is, don't you?

00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,655
I certainly do.

Oh, it's the other phone.

"He faints."

311
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,244
I'm talking as loud as I can.
- Yeah.

312
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:13,944
Don't we always have
spaghetti for dinner?
- Yeah.

313
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:16,510
Alright, we'll have raviolis.
- "And you rush over..."

314
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:18,453
Of course, I'll be home.

barber shop and get shaved

321

the scene and the picture

We can cut that out.

No, no, no, a dog bit me.

ran straight out

349
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,967
and grabbed me by the fetlock.

350
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:23,879
Rather fortunate it wasrt
a Newfoundland dog
that bit you.

351
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,349
Yes, rather.
I suppose so.

352
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,683
I'm sleeping here somewhere,
but I don't quite know where.

353
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:34,054
Well, there's no other place
to sleep if you don't sleep
in the plane here.

354
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,615
That's right.

355
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:38,390
No hotels around anywhere.

356
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:45,926
Here you are, Mr. Fields.

357
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,596
Well, thank you.

358
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:50,704
Where are you supposed
to sleep, in that
little hammock up there?

359
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:51,833
Yes, sir.

360
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:53,839
Good night, Uncle Bill.

361
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,106
Good night, dear.

362
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:58,011
I'll be right
across the way, dear.

363
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:01,951
I'll be up here all alone,
except that fly.
Get out of there.

364
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:13,690
Get the other leg, please.
Thanks.

365
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:16,632
I use both of them, usually.

366
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:21,830
There's some answers
in my cap again.

367
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,020
Time to get up, sir.
We're landing shortly.

368
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,185
Oh!

369
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:42,453
Oh!

370
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,085
Are you airsick?

371
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,255
No, dear.

372
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,596
Somebody put too many olives
in my martinis, last night.

373
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,260
Shall I get you a Bromo?

374
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,361
No, I couldn't
stand the noise.

375
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,329
Time to get up, little lady.

376
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:57,739
FIELDS: Get up, dear.

377
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:58,833
OK.

378
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,710
We're landing
in a few minutes... Half hour.

379
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,647
2 or 3... What time did
she say we were landing?

380
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,748
Maybe we're not going to land.
Go back to sleep again.

381
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,052

00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:56,031
Clouds.

392
00:28:57,368 --> 00:29:02,362
There's enough material there
for a Ringling Brother's big top.

393
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:04,835
Maybe a smuggler.

394
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,571
You, a big nose have-it.

395
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:09,579
Oh, that's a surprise to me.

396
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:12,741
I say, I should take that
as a personal insult.

397
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:14,148
Yeah, I should, too.

398
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,551
I, you hate, too.

399
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,822
He hates you, too.

400
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:27,093
Here, here, I say. Half a tick,
old man, half a tick.

401
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,190
Ohh!

402
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,404
Steady on, old man, steady on.

403
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:39,006
I have a big nose,
have I, eh?

404
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:42,342
You, me on the head hitted?

405
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:46,844
Say boys, let me out of this
thing. I'm neutral. Go ahead.

406
00:29:56,294 --> 00:30:00,560
Forgot my soap, forgot my
razor, I forgot everything.

407
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:03,324
Pardon me.

408
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,134
No wonder they call this
a giant airliner.

409
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:17,107
Do you travel as one person, or
d'you get a party rate of 10?

410
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,514
OK, don't answer.

411
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:29,450
Here. Oh, here you are.
Here.

412
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,191
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

413
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:35,255
I didn't sleep well last night.

414
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,699
- You didn't?
I'm troubled with insomnia.

415
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,669
Oh, insomnia.

416
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:41,967
Well, I know a good
cure for it.
- Yeah?

417
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,234
Get plenty of sleep.

418
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:44,570
Sleep, huh?

419
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:46,473
That's what
the doctor told me.

420
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:48,736
Toothbrush.

421
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:56,386
At least you're not on the plane
in the morning when I get off.

422
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,147
Excuse me.

423
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,652
Always brush them down
like that.
- Brush them down.

424
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:04,319
Never across like that.
- No, no, no, no.

425
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:07,558
That's what it says in the
latest etiquette book. Yeah.

426
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,329
Oh, I got more cleaner.
I need more.

427
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:32,517
Must have just
gone through a cloud.

428
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:39,789
That's a hot one.

429
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:42,594
You were shaving me
and I'm shaving you.

430
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:49,231
Are you ready, dear?

431
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:50,399
Be ready in a jiffy.

432
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,476
A jiffy? Oh, OK.

433
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:55,910
Well, I'll meet you
on the back platform, dear.

434
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,969
Alright.

435
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,106
OK, dear.

436
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:00,911
Hello, there.

437
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,145
Oh, miss.

438
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:17,024
What inclement weather!

439
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,340
What are you drinking,
Uncle Bill?

440
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:32,611
Oh, just a little ginger ale,
dear. Pull up a chair there.

441
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:41,053
You know, Uncle Bill,
I've been thinking.
Why didn't you ever marry?

442
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,390
I was in love with
a beautiful blonde once, dear.

443
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:48,660
Drove me to drink.
That's the one thing
I'm indebted to her for.

444
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,460
Go and pack your little
portmanteau, will you, dear?

445
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:53,902
Alright.

446
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:05,938
Uncle Bill!

447
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:12,313
Uncle Bill!

448
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,644
Aahh!

449
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,594
Oh, boy.

450
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:05,175
Why didn't I think
of that parachute?
Well, there she goes.

451
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,014
What a bump.
And how fortunate...

452
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:12,142
How do you do?

453
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,244
Do you live here?

454
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:15,546
What are you?

455
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,110
I'm an American citizen.

456
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:19,345
An American eagle?

457
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:23,019
No, it's the first time
I've ever been up
in a plane in my life.

458
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:25,688
I'm just a man.

459
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:27,390
Man?

460
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,660
I never heard
that word before.

461
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:30,894
You didn't?

462
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:32,333
Are you really a man?

463
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,428
Well, I've been called
other things.

464
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:38,441
I've never seen one before
in all my life.

465
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:41,034
You never have, eh?

466
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:45,315
Mother brought me
to the nest here when
I was only three months old.

467
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:48,750
Oh, she did, eh?
And you've never seen a man?

468
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,818
Do you ever play
the game of squidgilum?

469
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:56,986
No. The only game
I've ever played is bean bag.

470
00:34:57,061 --> 00:35:01,498
Bean bag?
Oh, it's very good. Becomes
very exciting at times.

471
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:05,764
I saw the championship
played in Paris.
Many people were killed.

472
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,269
Pull up a chair.

473
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,975
Get a little closer here.
You're too far away.

474
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:19,380
Wait a minute.
Maybe I'm the one.

475
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,678
Now, you put your hands
on your head that way.

476
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:30,851
That's it.
Now, close your eyes
and pucker your lips a bit.

477
00:35:58,556 --> 00:35:59,989
Shall we play another rubber?

478
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:03,091
Why, Mother.

479
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,150
Grr!

480
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,468
Romulus and Remus.

481
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,303
What are you doing here?

482
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:14,929
Mother, this is a man.

483
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:18,373
He fell out of an airplane
and brought a wonderful
new game to us.

484
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:20,034
It's called squidgilum.

485
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:22,102
You pull two chairs together.

486
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,648
Place your hands on your head
in this fashion.

487
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:28,116
Then you close your eyes,
and then you both
press your lips together.

488
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,946
I'll try it with him.

489
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,552
Mother knows best.

490
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:38,520
Close your eyes, Mother.

491
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:05,783
Men, men, they're all alike.

492
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:08,017
They'll deceive you
as your father did me.

493
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:10,925
He kissed a chorus girl
and when I found it out,
he said,

494
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:14,726
"Oh, I was drunk
and didn't know
what I was doing."

495
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,931
Do you think he drinks?

496
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:21,199
He didn't get that nose
from playing Ping-Pong.

497
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:29,606
What a catastrophe.

498
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:34,581
Just a minute, Mr. Fields.
There is a limit
to everything.

499
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:37,815
This script is an insult to
a man's intelligence, even mine.

500
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,948
You drop from a plane,
10,000 feet in the air,

501
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:43,459
and you land on a divan
without a scratch.

502
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:45,085
You play post office
with a beautiful blonde,

503
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:47,630
and then you throw yourself
over a cliff in a basket.

504
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:50,758
It's impossible,
inconceivable,
incomprehensible.

505
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:53,497
And besides that,
it's no good.

506
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,899
And as for the continuity,
it's terrible.

507
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:02,503
And for my own information,
off the record, what's
happened to Gloria Jean?

508
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,242
Where has she been
all this time?

509
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:08,513
Oh. Oh, I see. Here, she is.

510
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:12,352
"Poor little Gloria
almost in tears,
waiting at the airport,

511
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,084
<i>"not knowing</i>
<i>which way to turn,</i>
<i>when suddenly..."</i>

512
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,786
Telephone, honey.

513
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,733
Hello? Uncle Bill!

514
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:27,030
Where are you? What?

515
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,306
Yes. Yes, I'll be right over.

516
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:34,177
How do you get to
the Russian village?

517
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:36,076
I'll take care of it.

518
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,543
I fell out of an airplane

519
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:47,022
whilst trying to retrieve

and landed on
the pinnacle of yonder rock,

521
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:56,322
where is domiciled
a vision of loveliness,
if ever there was one,

522
00:38:56,934 --> 00:39:00,529
and her mother, a buzzard,
if ever there was one.

523
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:03,903
If that girl is
as beautiful as you say,
I'll scale the wall tomorrow.

524
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:05,271
I've heard about them.

525
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:08,369
They say the old buzzard's
husband walked out on her
before the girl was born.

526
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:11,472
And the buzzard vowed that
the daughter would never see
or hear the name "man"

527
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:12,573
as long as she lived.

528
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,777
They also say the old gal
has a bank roll so big,

529
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,547
a greyhound
couldn't leap over it.

530
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,780
Yeah?

531
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:24,252
Well, she seems
to have a kind heart, too.

532
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:30,192
Maybe you could induce her
to come down and talk turkey

533
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:34,499
to one that really loves her
and has her interest at heart.

534
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:38,672
She seemed like
an awfully nice woman to me,

535
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:43,703
now that
I come to think of it.

Yes, it lives in the desert.

650
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:50,936
Flies backwards to keep
the sand out of its eyes.

651
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:59,418

is that starts this thing.

661
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:40,982

662
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:45,291
a token of my love and esteem.

663

-Here they are.
- Thank you.

00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:55,029

668
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,602
Oh, please do.

00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:03,138
Thank you.

670
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:05,943
Once when I...

671
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:09,543
Oh, dear. Are you hurt?

672
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,215
I can't tell yet.

673
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:14,150
-Oh, my!
- Drat!

674
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:17,687
Pardon me.
May I remove the basket?

675
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:19,956
-Yes, please do.
- Thank you.

676
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:34,305
-Good gracious!
- Yes.

677
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:38,143
Oh, my!
Oh, I'm so sorry.

678
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,979
It's quite alright,
quite alright.

679
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,518
Can you do
anything with it?

680
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:43,848
I think I can do
something with it.

681
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,717
I don't know what yet.

682
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,254

But I still love him.

685
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:54,096
My dear Mrs. Hemogloben,

686
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:58,794
when I first saw you I was so
enamored with your beauty...

687
00:53:58,868 --> 00:54:01,200
Oh, Mr. Fields.

688
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:03,330
...I ran to the basket,
jumped in,

689
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:07,735
went down to the city and
bought myself a wedding outfit.

690
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:14,781
And now I'm here to lay
my heart at your feet.

691
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:18,013
You are so full of romance.

692
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:21,216
Every night, every night.
What's the matter
with this thing?

693
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:22,918
Sit down on it again,
will you, so I can get up.

694
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:24,085
Let me help you.

695
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:28,223
Oh, dear, everything
seems to be going wrong.

696
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:29,629
Yes, it does.

697
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:31,189
Mother!

698
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:34,829
Mother, Mr. Carson and I are gonna
be married and right away, too.

699
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:37,771
Mr. Fields brought up the owner
of the cantina, Mr. Clines.

700
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:40,332
He's sheriff, magistrate
and mayor of the village.

701
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:42,310
He's going to
marry us immediately.

702
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:46,070
Why not make it
a double-header?
It's Saturday afternoon,

703
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:47,810
and I haven't anything to do.

704
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:50,614
Mr. Fields,
this is so sudden.

705
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:53,387
I'm so happy.

706
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:54,855
And so am I.

707
00:54:57,427 --> 00:54:58,985
Hello there!

708
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:02,562
My dream girl!

709
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:08,267
Leon!

710
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:13,232
My <i>bon ami!

711
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:17,112
Have you seen our... My...

712
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:19,148
Her hanging swimming pool?

713
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:20,614
Hanging swimming...
No.

714
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:23,915
Say, dear, why don't I show
him the hanging swimming pool?

715
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:33,090
Hanging swimming pool?
Where is this hanging swimming...

716
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,654
Why, right here. Get up on there,
you can see it a little better.

717
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:39,099
It's gonna be better?
Oh, yeah.

718
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,158
Yeah!

719
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:44,999
Help! Help! Help!

720
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:52,180
(SPLASH)

721
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:59,979
Suffering sciatica!

722
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:02,891
Last time
it was pink elephants.

723
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:05,017
(EXPLOSION)

724
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,528
Oh, you're back.
- Yeah.

725
00:56:09,899 --> 00:56:11,662
The poor chap
just had a mishap.

726
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:12,793
Oh, that's too bad.

727
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,234
Slipped over the parapet.

728
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:15,328
Oh, my!

729
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:17,935
Shall we proceed
with the ceremony?

730
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:19,770
Just as you say.

731
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:22,710
Thank you, Mrs. Hemogloben.

732
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:24,474
May I call you Daisy?

733
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,242
Oh, I wish you would.

734
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:28,284
- Uncle Bill.
- Yes, dear?

735
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:29,443
May I see you a minute?

736
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:31,851
Certainly. Excuse me,
Mrs. Hemogloben.

737
00:56:31,921 --> 00:56:33,149
Certainly.

738
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:46,426
What is it?

739
00:56:46,468 --> 00:56:49,026
Uncle Bill, I don't
want you to get married.

740
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:54,770
You listen to me, missy.
Don't you want to live
in this beautiful nest?

741
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:57,106
Have a personal maid?
- No.

742
00:56:57,814 --> 00:57:02,615
Wear diaphanous gowns?
And eat regularly?

743
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:05,119
I just want to be with you.

744
00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:06,585
You'll be with me.

745
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:08,214
But she'll be with us.

746
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:15,355
I never thought of that.

747
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:32,004
We're falling 2,000 feet!

748
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:33,571
It's alright, dear.

749
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:39,077
Don't start worrying
until we get down to 1,999!

750
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:42,116
It's the last foot
that's dangerous.

751
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:47,891
That's all! That's enough!
That's too much!

752
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:50,861
Airplanes with sun decks!

753
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:54,028
Russian villages in the sky!

754
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:56,663
Gorillas playing post office!

755
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:59,674
Cows, sheep, goat's milk!

756
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:05,113
I'm going and when I get back
you'd better not be here.

757
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:07,149
I don't care
where you go, just go!

758
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:10,209
Go, go get a drink!
Get two drinks!
Get a dozen drinks!

759
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,893
Gimme a drink, I'm dying.

760
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:20,259
What'll it be?

761
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:23,131
Jumbo ice-cream soda.
- What flavor?

762
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:27,260
Oh, I don't care.
Spinach, horseradish,
anything you got there.

763
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:30,568
I'll give you peach.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

764
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:37,905
I feel as though
somebody stepped on
my tongue with muddy feet.

765
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:44,211
This scene's supposed
to be in a saloon,
but the censor cut it out.

766
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:46,152
It'll play just as well.

767
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:51,724
Oh, come on! Where's my drink?

768
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:56,758
Oh, aah!

769
00:58:57,934 --> 00:59:01,267
It's killers like you
that give the West a bad name.

770
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:06,471
Give me a couple of
ladyfingers, will you, please?

771
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:11,704
Thank you.

772
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:21,046
Ah, that's better.

773
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:30,491
So long, Tom. I'd rather be
in a saloon at that.

774
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,402
Don't you worry about it.

775
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,640
But Uncle Bill
said he's going away.

776
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:55,343
Fine, fine. I mean,
now don't worry
about your Uncle Bill.

777
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:58,080
He's lived his life;
ruined mine.

778
01:00:58,154 --> 01:00:59,815
Now it's you
we've got to think about.

779
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:02,449
You're young, you've got
a great career ahead of you.

780
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:03,719
You're gonna do big things.

781
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:05,954
Maybe Uncle Bill
can write you another story.

782
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:09,590
No, no, no, don't say that.
I never want to see him again.

783
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:11,493
He's a numbskull.

784
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:14,092
Do you know
what Uncle would do
if he heard you say that?

785
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,434
No. What would your uncle do
if he heard me say that?

786
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:17,598
This.

787
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:23,640
And if Uncle Billdoesn't work
here anymore, I don't either.

788
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:30,277
But I don't want you to go
away without me, Uncle Bill.

789
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:34,250
But the enterprise which
I'm about to embark on

790
01:01:34,323 --> 01:01:36,985
is fraught with eminent peril,

791
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:41,324
much too dangerous for a
young lady of your tender years.

792
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:45,959
Another thing, I promised your
mother I'd look out for you.

793
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,297
But how can you
look out for me

794
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:48,894
when I'm here and
you're way down there?

795
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:50,598
You want to go to school,
don't you?

796
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:52,106
No.

797
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:54,666
You want to grow up
and be dumb like Zasu Pitts?

798
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:58,407
She only acts like that
in pictures. I like her.

799
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:00,381
Don't you want to be smart?
- No.

800
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:02,179
I want to be like you.

801
01:02:02,985 --> 01:02:05,044
Don't you think I'm smart?
- Not very.

802
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:06,986
I don't like teachers, anyhow.

803
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:10,688
There's no sense in arguing
with a woman. You go with me...

804
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,318
Yippee!

805
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,555

you're backing into,
you big lummox?

to be down there a year.

01:02:33,015 --> 01:02:34,107
OK. Thanks, Uncle.

811
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:35,650
You're welcome, dear.

01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:40,805
Look out there! Look out!

865
01:08:53,028 --> 01:08:57,055
What a splendid view
of Californian climate.

866
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:05,702
He said the fire
is back there!

867
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:11,975
Go back!

868
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:14,413
Tell him to make up his mind!

869
01:09:19,054 --> 01:09:22,455
(CRASH)

870
01:09:23,025 --> 01:09:25,391
Stretcher!

871
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:43,043
Aaaah!

872
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:44,769
- Quiet.
- Where am I?

873
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:46,212
Quiet, please.
You'll alarm
the other patients.

874
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:48,443
What do I care
about the other patients?
Where are my clothes?

875
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:50,417
Go away from me!
Just a minute. Just a minute.

876
01:09:50,486 --> 01:09:52,784
Just a minute, nothing!
Give me my clothes
and let me out of here.

877
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:53,913
Wait a minute!

878
01:09:56,725 --> 01:09:58,716
Uncle Bill, are you alright?

879
01:09:58,794 --> 01:10:02,525
Lucky I didn't
have an accident,
I'd have never gotten here.

880
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:05,667
My Uncle Bill, but I still love him.

881
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:11,667
