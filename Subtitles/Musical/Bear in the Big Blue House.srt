1
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,713
The Bear

2
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,717
That's a huge male.

3
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,839
Bet he's more than 1500 pounds.

4
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,393
Hey look!

5
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,188
An Hour ... Hour and a half.

6
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,115
Good. We're downwind now.

7
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,278
Why'd you shoot?

8
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,831
- I was in a good position.
- Well you should have waited for me son.

9
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,638
A damned shame.

10
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,354
You got him in the left shoulder.

11
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,189
He spun around on his forlegs -
from right to left.

12
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,476
If you'd had hit him in the hindlegs
he'd never gotten up again.

13
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:31,240
A bear always turns into his wounds.
You spooked him son.

14
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,829
My gun jammed.

15
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,355
You're not even close to seeing him again.
Not even with them glasses.

16
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,188
Take it from me. Give up!

17
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,912
He's miles away by now.

18
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,917
What's that?

19
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,952
Easy girl.

20
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,358
Come on.

21
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,632
Whooa boy.

22
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,431
Hold it!

23
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,272
I swear it. I'll kill you.

24
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,078
Don't worry.

25
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,313
With a little luck I'll be back
before your foot is mended.

26
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:23,279
Wait 'till you see them dogs!
We'll have us some fun.

27
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,592
Dixie!

28
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,315
Come on Dixie Belle.

29
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,278
Come on you curlyhaired girl.

30
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,552
Come on beautiful. Good dog.

31
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,400
Hoppin' around. Hop with me.

32
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,235
Did you miss me Dixie?

33
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,752
Over here!

34
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,791
Get up there, come on.

35
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,838
There he is.

36
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,957
Here grab on.

37
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,556
He's out of range.

38
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,838
Don't shoot. You'll hit the dogs!

39
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,278
Gotcha.

40
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,428
You wanna bite me huh?

41
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,279
You're a naughty little fella.

42
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,635
Who's that up there?

43
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:08,200
Horse.

44
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,913
Men - stupid men.

45
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:24,512
I'm Tom.

46
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:40,237
You hear that?
The dogs have made it back.

47
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,992
Come on my babies. Come here.

48
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:24,552
Look what he's done to you.
Damn!

49
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,236
Back here, get back here.

50
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,999
Here Kamic. Here.

51
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,831
Take it easy.

52
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:14,829
Lie down! Stop it!

53
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:01,995
Look ...
Darn cubby chewed through the rope.

54
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,957
Forget him. Let's move on.

55
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,599
Wait.

56
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:04,589
What's that?

57
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:09,790
Good huh?

58
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,517
Come on ... you hungry?

59
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:26,069
You wanna stand up?

60
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:30,239
It's down here now ...
No it's up here. Stand up.

61
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,750
He likes it.

62
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:51,589
You do want it don't you?
Where did it go?

63
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:01,711
Stop fooling around.
We've got things to do.

64
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:09,108
You'll see Tom. This is
just the place to box him in.

65
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,872
You told Joseph to keep the 
dogs muzzled didn't you?

66
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:45,833
He's waiting by the creek.

67
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:49,151
Here we are.

68
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:53,199
You pick a spot up there.
I'll take the other side.

69
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:57,592
Sooner or later he's gotta come through here.
You stay put.

70
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:02,072
Don't worry.
I won't move.

71
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:21,712
Damn.

72
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:16,715
Please don't kill me.

73
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,510
Go, go away.

74
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,358
Hurry.

75
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:01,069
Get out of sight. Hide.

76
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:08,072
I got him. He fell like a stone
there - clear over the edge.

77
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,275
Okay little fella.

78
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:23,790
You're free to go now.

79
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,152
So long.

80
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,913
How long have we known each other?

81
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:16,594
- Three months?
- Five.

82
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:26,430
I don't like to ask folks questions.

83
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:33,279
Everyone has their secrets.
By God that's the way it should be.

84
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:41,750
Look who's taken a shine
to civilization.

85
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:06,914
Good luck little fella.

86
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:02,079
The greatest thrill 
is not in killing -

87
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:04,510
- but in letting live.
James Oliver Curwood.
