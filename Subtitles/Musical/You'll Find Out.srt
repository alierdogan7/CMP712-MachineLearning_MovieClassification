00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:39,656
Prince?
He's a prince like I'm the Queen of Sheba.

656
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:42,226
I did a little snooping
when I arrived today.

657
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,871
And I found that poor Aunt Margo's
been subsidizing...

658
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:47,530
...that turban-topped Svengali
for months and months.

659
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:49,073
- On the level?
- Mm-hm.

660
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:52,144
She's already given him
a young fortune for the relief...

661
00:38:52,313 --> 00:38:55,612
...of unemployed spirits
or something equally silly.

662
00:38:55,783 --> 00:38:59,116
If you think he's a phony, why don't you
make him pack up his spirits...

663
00:38:59,286 --> 00:39:02,881
...and take them back to the distillery?
- Aunt Margo is the boss, Kay.

664
00:39:03,057 --> 00:39:05,719
You see, Daddy left her the house
and most of his money.

665
00:39:05,893 --> 00:39:09,852
I guess he thought it would spoil me less
to struggle along with a small trust fund.

666
00:39:10,031 --> 00:39:12,192
- But what about the surprise?
- Oh, that?

667
00:39:12,366 --> 00:39:14,926
Have you ever heard of
Professor Karl Fenninger?

668
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:19,101
Isn't he the psychic expert
who exposed all those fake mediums?

669
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,467
Exactly.

670
00:39:20,641 --> 00:39:24,008
Well, I had Judge Mainwaring call him up
and invite him to the party.

671
00:39:24,178 --> 00:39:26,203
- Why didn't he come?
- Lightning trouble.

672
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,940
With that bridge down,
he just won't be able to make it.

673
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,743
I hope I'm not intruding, Janis.

674
00:39:30,918 --> 00:39:33,751
Oh, of course not, darling.
You're just in time.

675
00:39:33,921 --> 00:39:36,412
I've been telling them
about his royal slyness.

676
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:39,024
Oh. You made it clear, I hope...

677
00:39:39,193 --> 00:39:42,185
...that I don't entirely share
your opinion of Prince Saliano.

678
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:47,326
You see, my legal training teaches me
not to jump to conclusions without proof.

679
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:50,561
I'll bet Professor Fenninger
would have given you proof.

680
00:39:50,738 --> 00:39:53,206
But anyway,
now you know why I have no surprise.

681
00:39:53,374 --> 00:39:56,036
- I think perhaps I have one for you, Janis.
- You have?

682
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:57,905
Yes.

683
00:39:59,213 --> 00:40:02,011
Now, then, Miss Bellacrest...

684
00:40:02,183 --> 00:40:04,674
...Miss Simms, Mr. Kyser, Mr. Deems.

685
00:40:04,852 --> 00:40:08,344
Allow me to present
Professor Karl Fenninger.

686
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,128
I am honored.

687
00:40:17,264 --> 00:40:18,993
Professor Fenninger.

688
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,861
I'm really happy to see you.

689
00:40:21,035 --> 00:40:22,059
Thank you.

690
00:40:22,236 --> 00:40:25,069
And, uh, please forgive me
for eavesdropping...

691
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,934
...but just part of my profession.

692
00:40:27,108 --> 00:40:30,509
But I don't understand.
How did you get here with the bridge down?

693
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:34,637
Oh, I arrived, of course,
before the bridge collapsed, but, uh...

694
00:40:34,815 --> 00:40:38,046
...I took the liberty
of making a brief investigation...

695
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:40,449
...without announcing my presence.

696
00:40:40,621 --> 00:40:42,521
Very clever of you, professor.

697
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,488
Yes, very clever.

698
00:40:45,759 --> 00:40:48,353
Incidentally, mademoiselle,
I owe you an apology.

00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:52,329
- An apology?
- That face you saw at your window...

...it was mine.

Oh, professor,
you've made me feel better already.

702
00:40:57,605 --> 00:40:59,732
- Dinner is served, Miss Bellacrest.
- Thank you.

703
00:40:59,907 --> 00:41:01,636
Professor, you'll join us, of course?

- Come on, everybody. Judge?
- Yes.

706
00:41:16,023 --> 00:41:18,218

00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:20,519

00:41:22,963 --> 00:41:26,490
Ah, <i>The Man With the Golden Helmet.</i>

709
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:28,635
Yes, Rembrandt.

Why is she still alive?

714
00:41:40,948 --> 00:41:43,416
Saliano missed again last night.

715
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,519
We've missed too many times.
She'll certainly suspect something.

716
00:41:46,687 --> 00:41:48,712
We won't miss tonight.

717
00:41:48,889 --> 00:41:52,655
We must arrange for Saliano
to conduct a seance.

718
00:41:52,826 --> 00:41:56,057

when the room is in darkness.

And by the way, dinner is served.

Who is this fellow, Kyser?

726
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,201
Some band leader.

727
00:42:39,607 --> 00:42:43,099
We have nothing to fear from him.
He's perfectly harmless.

728
00:42:58,692 --> 00:43:00,557
No, thank you.

729
00:43:00,728 --> 00:43:02,195
- Kay, did you tell him?
- Not yet.

730
00:43:02,363 --> 00:43:03,523
Come on and tell him now.

731
00:43:03,697 --> 00:43:07,497
- Are you sure it'll be all right?
- I'm positive. Come on.

may I see you a moment, professor?

Madame, excuse me, please.

737
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,010
- Well, certainly. Of course.
- He is interesting.

738
00:43:23,884 --> 00:43:24,976
Listen, professor.

739
00:43:25,152 --> 00:43:29,555
Janis wants us to get Saliano
to hold a seance so you can expose him.

740
00:43:29,723 --> 00:43:31,350
She's convinced he's a faker.

741
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,356
That wouldn't surprise me at all.

742
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:36,428
Fine. Now, if we work together,
you can be a great help.

743
00:43:36,597 --> 00:43:39,589
I'll get him steamed up,
then you hop in and challenge him...

744
00:43:39,767 --> 00:43:41,894
...so he won't be able to back down.

00:43:42,069 --> 00:43:43,468
Is that okay with you?

00:43:43,637 --> 00:43:45,901
I couldn't have thought of
a better plan myself.

747
00:43:46,073 --> 00:43:49,406

- Yes, indeed, we'll take care of her.

don't actually happen.

1488
01:35:54,532 --> 01:35:56,523
It's, uh, all in fun.

1489
01:35:56,701 --> 01:36:00,535
And so we'll be on the air, as usual,
next Wednesday night.

1490
01:36:00,705 --> 01:36:04,141
And until then, we'll be thinking of you.

1491
01:36:04,309 --> 01:36:06,334
So long, everybody.
