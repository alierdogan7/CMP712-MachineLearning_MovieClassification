24
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,266
Osu, Grasshopper.

25
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,852
Osu, Grandmaster.

26
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,604
-You're here early.
-No, I'm here right on time.

27
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:48,817
- Yo, how did he get in here?
- Um, this is the Fantastic Four Plus One.

28
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,944
Yeah, this is the crew.

29
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,405
This is my wordsmith.

30
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,325
He's the dude that
rocked the mic at your jam.

31
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,910
Osu, Grandmaster.

32
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,288
Over here, I got the system set up.

33
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,290
Organized just like yours, man.

34
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:07,419
Matching Technics SL-23 turntables,
just like yours.

35
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,379
If I could just show you...

36
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,466
Woo-hoo.

37
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,346
All right,
everyone sit zazen in front of me.

38
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:28,106
Sneaking out of the house
in the middle of the night,

39
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,691
you're gonna get grounded.

40
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,111
But I know this is not how
you wanted to spend your summer.

41
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:37,574
It's fine. Five days a week in a soup
kitchen might be the best thing for me.

42
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,951
Look at you.

43
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:43,413
My baby's becoming a woman.
What happened to your friend Ezekiel?

44
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,832
Papi said he's not
playing piano for us no more.

45
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,000
I don't know.

46
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,420
What a shame.
That boy never missed a beat.

47
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,713
<i>Buenos días.</i>

48
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:55,092
-Cisco. I'm surprised to see you here.
-One for you.

49
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,761
The punished girl can have a treat, right?

50
00:02:59,054 --> 00:02:59,930
My savior.

51
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,558
Live out your sentence with dignity,
and you shall soon be free.

52
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:08,063
Until then... head high.

53
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,193
Universal DJ rule 17, Grasshopper.

54
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,612
"In order to fly,
a DJ must trust his wings."

55
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,614
-And are these your wings?
-Yes, Grandmaster.

56
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,408
Then you must learn to trust them.

57
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,829
I have, in my hand, the key
to my Quick Mix theory.

58
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,373
- A crayon, Grandmaster?
- What's the crayon for?

59
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,416
Nice.

60
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,459
- You're not messing with me?
- No.

61
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,336
Well, what about the get-down?

62
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,422
You were supposed to show me
how to do what you do.

63
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:36,383
Do not underestimate the crayon.

64
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:43,390
I promised you the secret,
not the answer, Grasshopper.

65
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:47,519
To earn the answer,
you must solve the mystery as one.

66
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:51,440
And when you unlock the gate,
we will walk through it together as one.

67
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,318
Put your hand out
in the position of Sun Tzu's offering.

68
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,779
I hand you the magic,

69
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,907
the mystery, the opening, Grasshopper.

70
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:05,662
You have 24 hours, or my offer expires.

71
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:06,955
Osu.

72
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:12,043
Twenty-four hours.

73
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:18,341
- Fixing Jesus?
<i>- Sí.</i>

74
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:21,928
I thought he was supposed to be fixing us.
A little bit to the left there.

75
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,472
<i>Eso, eso, eso.</i>

76
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,144
I brought you an Icee.

77
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,896
Lemon-cherry.

78
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,398
-I'm not hungry.
-It ain't steak, bro.

79
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,235
Why you here, Francisco?

80
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:41,698
So, a little <i>pajarito </i>in the tree tells me
you're struggling to fill seats here.

81
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:46,745
As it happens, I see a bunch of sinners
on my walk over...

82
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,165
- I tell them about Sunday service.
- Is that so?

83
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,460
<i>Seguro que sí.</i> Bro, you gonna have
about a dozen more <i>Boricuas </i>here

84
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,253
just looking to see the light.

85
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,006
You better bring out the secret weapon.

86
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,174
Secret weapon?

87
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,678
- You mean Mylene?
- That's why everybody comes here, right?

88
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,557
I mean, of course and...
you're great, too.

89
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,185
Just trying to help.
If you want me to tell them not to come--

90
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,771
No, no, no.
You did the right thing.

91
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,653
<i>Oye...</i>

92
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,822
Myle, she...

93
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,367
she came to me the other night
pretty rattled.

94
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,036
-Because she defied me.
-Defied you?

95
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,455
She's a teenager.
That's what they do. They defy.

96
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,166
Yes, but my job
is to protect her from herself.

97
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,629
<i>Esta bien,</i> and I support that.
But your grip, man, it's too tight.

98
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,589
You gotta loosen up a little bit.

99
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,551
She's not your daughter.
She's my daughter.

100
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:45,887
You... You're lucky
I don't cut her off from you.

101
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,681
- Cut her off?
- Ramon?

102
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,683
-<i>¿Todo bien?</i>
-Jesus' pin-up girl.

103
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,685
-Diablo.
-We're just finishing here, Lydia.

104
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,021
Okay. Take your time.

105
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:00,443
Cut me off? Then cut me off, man.
Are you threatening me?

106
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,945
You're a bad influence.

107
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,364
She sees your lifestyle. She sees it.

108
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:08,326
- Easy come, easy go.
- The-- The money.

109
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,788
Yeah, the money that paid for the
fucking opera house that you had to have?

110
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,332
I can go back to street preaching
if I have to.

111
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,917
I answer to Christ our Savior.

112
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,795
You know, you need to get off
of your high, proud horse, Ramon.

113
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,381
I need you to speak to me of pride?
I know where that sin leads.

114
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:25,176
And no daughter of mine is going to go
where I have been. Now you stay--

115
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,303
Man--

116
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,683
Keep away from her, Francisco.

117
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,063
I apologize, <i>hermano.</i>

118
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,570
Forgive me for trying to talk sense
into His Holiness.

119
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,329
There you are.

120
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,955
Inspector Mooch.

121
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,416
Annie, most days I can tolerate
Sonny Boy here

122
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,835
and his charming, mirthful disposition.

123
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,296
-This is not one of those days.
-Get lost a while, Clarence.

124
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:04,049
But if this concerns the shooting,
this concerns business.

125
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,384
And if this concerns business,
this concerns me.

126
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,428
-Say it walking, Clarence.
-Better obey Mommy.

127
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,309
Devil.

128
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,812
Yeah, I know. The drug business.

129
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,398
I'm shutting everything down
until this thing calms down.

130
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,525
-Good.
-Look, I'm losing money here.

131
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,403
-Who's behind shooting up my club?
-Don't know yet.

132
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,864
But make no mistake, this was a hit.

133
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:28,865
A hit on you.

134
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,368
And what I can tell you for certain

135
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,371
is the dead assassin
was a Savage Warlord, El Viejo.

136
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,290
He was their chief.
So, whoever paid them to do this,

137
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,668
the Warlords took the gig serious.

138
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:42,337
-Think Harlem paid them to take me out?
-Maybe.

139
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,840
I want more for my money than maybes,
Moran.

140
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,720
You and me both.

141
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,641
Look, I'm neck-deep in this myself.
I will get to the bottom of this.

142
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:58,937
In the meantime, I'd love for your boys
at Bronx homicide to get off my back

143
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,440
and get my club reopened.
I can handle the rest.

144
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,445
El Viejo had a little brother in the gang.
Napoleon.

145
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,072
Have Wolf and Sonny Boy find him.

146
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,407
-Bring him in.
-I can do that.

147
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,993
And please...

148
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,037
no more dead bodies,

149
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:19,499
or we will have a problem
that even I can't solve.

150
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:27,298
"I hand you the magic, Grasshopper."

151
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,885
"Do not underestimate the crayon."

152
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,595
Look at Dizzee.

The picket fence is white.

- I need a vacation.

182
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,797
I'm producing three albums

183
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,969
On top of which, I sold these up-tempo

It's accounting, Cisco.

something would incarnate,

She said she had a vision from God,

00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,571
Of course she has a vision

-When I was young, that was my dream.

307
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:19,789
All right, Penny... meet Zeke.
Zeke, meet Penny.

308
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,207
Careful.

309
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,501
Let her know that you're calm
and in control.

310
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,752
She'll settle down.

311
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,505
-Just like the ladies, right?
-Yeah.

312
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,008
Dang, this is kind of cool.

313
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,885
All right. So, you ready for the show?

314
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:37,974
Hold this down.

315
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,269
Hold it down.

316
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:42,728
Okay, here we go.

317
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,522
-You ready?
-Yeah.

318
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,649
Open it up. Come on.

319
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,943
Come on out. Come on out, guys.
Come on out. Come on out.

320
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,987
Come on out. Come on out. Come on out.

321
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,824
Come on out. Come on out.
Come on out.

322
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,284
Come on, come on, come on.

323
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:59,078
Yeah. Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

324
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,788
Whoo!

325
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,126
-They do that natural, or they was taught?
-They do it natural.

326
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:09,046
Everything they do,
it got a natural purpose.

327
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,549
Nigga got wings,
a nigga gotta fly, right?

328
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,050
I wish I could fly.

329
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,096
Last night you were writing, weren't you?

330
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:18,681
So?

331
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,766
So, it probably means you're smart.

332
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:22,685
I mean, I ain't dumb.

333
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:27,148
So, when you're off... being all smart
and reading and writing

334
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:31,485
and thinking on smart shit,
you're flying, man.

335
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:32,862
Like Flash.

336
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,031
-How he controls the crowd.
-I guess, yeah.

337
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,116
How he moves the crowd, man.

338
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,201
That's...

339
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,288
That's gonna be my... my flying.

340
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:47,126
<i>♪ Fly, fly ♪</i>

341
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,676
-You ever thought of quitting?
-What?

342
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,013
You talking about the crayon?
Man, we gonna get that shit.

343
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,515
No, no, no. Inferno.

344
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,685
-You talking about hustling?
-You're working for drug dealers.

345
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:08,105
Trigger-happy gangsters,
shooting people who don't deserve to die.

346
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:11,567
Man, that's how I earn my keep. But...

347
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,986
I do got some money saved up.

348
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,365
Maybe take a summer holiday,
focus on the get-down.

349
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,200
I'll focus on my rhyming.

350
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,453
Throw some parties, get some girls...

351
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,039
not named Mylene.

352
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,753
A little vacation could be good.

353
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,755
-No bosses.
-Just music.

354
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,006
All day, every day.

355
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,010
Nigga got wings, nigga gotta fly, right?

356
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,473
Like these pigeons and shit.

357
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,142
Circling.

358
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:46,727
Spinning.

359
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,313
Spinning and grinning?

360
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,482
Spinning and grinning, Zeke.

361
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,568
Spinning and grinning, man.

362
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:56,904
Spinning.

363
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,699
Spinning and spinning.

364
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:01,367
Yo.

365

<i>The get-down plays on one...</i>

366
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,455
The key to my Quick Mix theory.

370
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,013
All right. Play it again.
Just the get-down.

371
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,306
All right. All right.

372
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,308
I gotta find it.

373
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,602
See, you say you gotta find it, right?

374
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,396
Maybe this shit will help.

375
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,689
-Got it?
-All right.

376
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:34,358
- That's it?

00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:27,912
Coming.

387
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,164
Hi, is Ezekiel home?

388
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:33,793
- Who's asking?
- Tell them Jehovahs to get out of here.

389
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,711
I'm his English teacher, Ms. Green.

390
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,798
-You must be...?
-His aunt, Wanda.

391
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,634
-Isn't school out?
-I just wanted to check in with him.

392
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,845
- He left his essay in my office.
- Okay. Thank you.

393
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:47,139
I also-- I wanted to talk to you.

394
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,143
Your nephew's one
of my brightest students,

395
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:55,189
and there's this program
run by Francisco Cruz.

396
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:58,108
You know, from the community center?
Ezekiel could go to college.

397
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,236
He can go to an Ivy League college.

398
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,404
-But we really need to start now.
-Ivy League?

399
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:03,489
Yes.

400
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:06,242
Who's gonna pay? You?

401
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:10,788
That kid spends enough time
in the clouds, okay?

402
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:15,626
It's hard as it is to keep him here
in the real world. This is not helping.

403
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:20,256
Ezekiel knows a whole lot more
about the real world than you think.

404
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,508
Why don't you do him a favor?

405
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,010
Just read that.

406
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:34,061
I thought you were gonna help me
when you came to church.

407
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,021
-Why you ain't at the dress shop?
-I--

408
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:38,107
Wait, how did you know about that?

409
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,069
Because I'm gonna owe Señora Lopez
like an arm for fibbing to your mother.

410
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:42,987
You set that up?

411
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,531
<i>Seguro que yes.</i>
I'm sitting there waiting for you.

412
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,786
Now imagine, it's Sunday.

413
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:56,041
You step forward for your solo...
in your pretty new dress.

414
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,835
Maybe a flower in your hair.

415
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,169
Nothing too decadent.

416
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,462
A lily.

417
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:01,964
And in that moment...

418
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,385
you gonna shine, <i>niña.</i>

419
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:10,014
I want you to act like it's the last song
you ever gonna sing.

420
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:14,935
Because in the crowd, there's gonna be
a man in a fancy suit, not me.

421
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:18,939
-A music producer.
-I knew it. I fucking knew it.

422
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,066
-Hey. <i>Respeta.</i>
-Sorry. <i>Lo siento.</i>

423
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,986
Hey, this has gotta be a secret.
Your parents cannot know.

424
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,073
Thank you, <i>tío.</i>

425
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,908
Ya-ya-ya-ya.

426
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:32,286
Now get to the dress shop
before we both get found out.

427
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,245
Okay.

428
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,414
<i>-Niña.</i>
-<i>Sí.</i>

429
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:38,292
You make us all proud?

430
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,837
- <i>Oye,</i> it's Francisco.
<i>- Hola.</i>

431
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,714
- Myle's on her way. 
<i>- Esta bien.</i>

432
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:45,424
Remember what I said about the dress.

433
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,508
Make it simple but modest.

434
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,344
<i>Pero que acentúe su cuerpo.</i>

435
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:51,513
No, no, no.
Don't accentuate nothing, I mean it.

436
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:54,183
She gotta shine,
but she gotta do it in God's house.

437
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:57,186
<i>Claro</i>, Francisco.
<i>Muy sencillo. No te preocupes.</i>

438
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,897
Yeah. "Don't worry."
"Don't worry," my ass.

439
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:34,306
Ooh. That looks lovely.

440
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,643
Sit down and have some with me.

441
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,688
I like my steak well done.

442
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,856
I like my mens well done.

443
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,359
But a good steak's like a prize fight.

444
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:48,112
It ain't good unless it's bloody.

445
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,530
Check that.

446
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:57,454
Can I talk to you a minute?

447
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:59,623
-I got an opportunity, Annie.
-Opportunity?

448
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:02,751
It's nothing that competes
with what's going on here.

449
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:05,546
-You leaving here?
-Just for a while.

450
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:06,588
I mean, yes.

451
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,049
Yes, I'm leaving here.

452
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,634
Can I have your blessing?

453
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,303
I've invested in you.

454
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:16,598
I've been grooming you.
I was about to promote you.

455
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:18,976
I'm disappointed.

456
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,312
It's something good for me, Annie,
and I'm good at it.

457
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:25,983
-A music thing, you know?
-You got the gift for graft, boy.

458
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,777
-And you wanna go blow a horn?
-It's not a horn. It...

459
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,613
-It's--
-It doesn't matter what it is.

460
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,907
You overestimate yourself.

461
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:37,161
Another ghetto clown
thinks he's Miles Davis.

462
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:40,789
Ends up miles from putting food
on the table, a roof overhead.

463
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,169
Okay.

464
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,596
When you need the other half of this,
you come see Annie.

465
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:59,850
But it ain't gonna be so easy here
for you the next time.

466
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,478
<i>Well done.</i>

467
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:06,982
You unlocked the secret of the crayon,
but that's only the first step.

468
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:10,402
Now once you've marked the get-down part,
you must dig.

469
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:14,364
Dig, dig, dig a tunnel
where the get-down sits.

470
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,493
All right,
now pay attention and listen to this.

471
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,580
<i>-♪ Don't go breaking my heart ♪</i>
-Now you hear that?

472
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:25,542
That is a void of useless nothing.
The wackness.

473
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:26,502
But here we go.

474
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:34,510
That is life and destiny.

475
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:38,889
That is the get-down beat.
That is what the B-boys get down to.

476
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:45,103
Now, because he possesses two turntables,
a DJ exists in two time zones, all right?

477
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:49,441
One turntable plays music that the dancers
are partying to right now,

478
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,109
and the other is playing music

479
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:54,112
that they will be partying to
in the imminent future.

480
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:55,781
Now...

481
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,658
Future. All right?

482
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:58,909
Check this out.

483
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,995
Now pay attention,
and watch my hands.

484
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:05,707
Remember, Grasshopper,
it's all about math.

485
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,460
Watch the mark.

486
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:15,342
-So, be in the moment, yes.
-But give the future your attention.

487
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,052
Exactly, wordsmith.

488
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,013
Making sure the get-down part
is ready to depart, all right?

489
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:22,474

00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,146
Check.

492
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,356
Under the needle.

493
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,650
Wait. What is...
What does "under the needle" mean?

494
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,403
That means the beat is locked,
loaded and ready to go.

495
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,240
Now that beat is fresh, right?

496
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,534
But you're racing
against the imminent wackness.

497
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,911
So, remember it's all about math,
Grasshopper.

498
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:47,916
Two, three, four. Check.

499
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,876
Under the needle.

500
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,503
One, two, three, four.

501
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:55,215
- Ooh. You see that?
- Two, three, four.

502
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:57,259
Check. Under the needle.

503
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,720
One, two, three, four.

504
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:03,223
You must be like Bruce Lee,
young Grasshopper. Flow like water.

505
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,603
It must be zen, in the moment.
It's a sonic and physical fight.

506
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,606
Whoo. Look at him go, Books.

507
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,191
Never in disarray. Every time.

508
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,068

509
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,404
Arrive, depart.

510
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:21,450
Now first...

511
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,744
you must master one record.

512
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:28,582
Manifest one single, infinite beat.

513
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,417
And, Grasshopper...

514
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:36,214
choose one you can live with
for a looonnnng time.

515
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:39,593
So choose wisely, or madness be thy name.

516
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,929
- Madness?
- You'll see.

517
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:47,517
Excruciating torment,
Chinese water-torture madness.

518
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,065
How did you do that, Grandmaster?

519
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,652
I know time.

520
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,992
-You fucking see that, man?
-He walked around the whole room.

521
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,828
Man. I fucking told you.
I told you.

522
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:10,290
-And he came back on the beat. Man.
-On the beat. That was--

523
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:11,291
I told you, didn't I?

524
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,629
Your uncle
got a hot record producer

525
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,381
coming to hear you sing in church?

526
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:21,927
Listen, you gotta sing better than Donna
and Gloria and Thelma put together.

527
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,514
Yeah. Some next-level shit.

528
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,057
What you gonna sing?

529
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,227
You ready? Okay.

530
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,041
Mylene, no.

531
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:58,547
You can't sing that crusty Jesus shit
to some hotshot music man.

532
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,091
Hello?
Are you forgetting where I'm singing?

533
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,468
At least the song shows my range.

534
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,595
Please tell me you're joking.

535
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:11,268
Fuck. You're not.

536
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,646
You're right.
There's no way a producer's gonna be like:

537
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:19,067
"Yo, that girl right there praising Jesus,
she's the next disco star of America."

538
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,737
-What the fuck do I do?
-This is my joint right here.

No.

622

we've always been there for each other.

00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:53,404
You finally cracked the code, Shao.

771
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,073
Tonight, you earned that holiday, nigga.

772
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:58,034
- Yeah, you did.
- Your hands was lightning flashy shit.

773
00:42:58,785 --> 00:42:59,786
But where you gonna go?

774
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:03,623
-Cooling it here.
-I'd go to Montego Bay, Jamaica.

775
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,167
Man, what you gonna do down there, Boo?

776
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,794
In my kingdom...

777
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:12,507
I motorboat big-ass Jamaican titties
on a motorboat.

778
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,175
And I wanna--

779
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,678
No, forget Jamaica.
France is where it's at.

780
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:19,806
Man, I hear French girls go topless
in their motorboats.

781
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:21,307
- I hear that, too.
- For real?

782
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,101
Yeah. Yeah.

783
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:24,894
How Mylene look topless?

784
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,813
- Shut up, Boo.
- Yo. Yo.

785
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:28,272
He don't know.

786
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:30,316
You don't.

787
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:33,444
Man... Stop.

788
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:36,864
Hey, we're gonna get to that
topless yacht in France one day, though.

789
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:39,742
All right? And we gonna
sail to Montego Bay.

790
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:41,244
-There we go.
-Mark my words.

791
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:43,162
I got big plans.

792
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:44,872
Fantastic Four Plus One.

793
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:48,501
You guys keep practicing.
All right, we gonna promote. All right?

794
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:51,129
We'll have a party. Shao's gonna spin.

795
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:53,923
Books is gonna rhyme.
Boo-Boo's our record boy.

796
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:56,425
Dizz can make some fly-ass fliers.

797
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,511
And we gonna charge.

798
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:01,681
Whoo...

799
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,725
Yeah.

800
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:11,315
I don't know, man. It doesn't seem
like Napoleon to skip out on a job.

801
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:14,569
- One word: pussy.
- So, who's this for, anyway?

802
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,445
A guy who claims
to be helping the South Bronx

803
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:18,156
when he's paying us to burn it.

804
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:39,510
Damn.

805
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:42,555
You know landlords be paying kids
good money for burning.

806
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:43,472
Cash.

807
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,141
I know.

808
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,768
- I never get why.
- Collect the insurance money.

809
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:50,479
If it's more than they're making in rent,
it's profitable, I guess.

810
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,025
Yo, is that our spot?

811
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,235
How would that be our spot
when we live over there?

812
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,404
- Shao!
- My fucking records!

813
00:44:58,613 --> 00:44:59,864
Hey, they didn't--

814
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:00,990
What about the rest of the gear?

815
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:03,951
- I got the turntable.
- You left the records?

816
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:44,784
Yo, Shao!

817
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,160
Shao!

818
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:49,080
Shao, wait up! Hey!

819
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,958
Shao, wait up. Shao.

820
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:54,460
Shao.

821
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,673
At least Dizz got a turntable,
you see that?

822
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,634
I mean, it's kind of crispy, but right?

823
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,430
You okay, Shao?

824
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,645
Never better, B.

825
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:15,439
Never better.

826
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,568
You tender-hearted, Books.
I like that about you.

827
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,947
But that shit back there ain't nothing
more than supply and demand.

828
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:26,200
Now we the ones in need of supply
of cash for our new equipment.

829
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,494
And we gotta go out there and demand it.

830
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,621
Shaolin, I should've known
you was already on

831
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:34,083
-to masterminding a new master plan.
-So, what you think?

832
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:38,629
Tomorrow, go to Les Infernos,
see Fat Annie.

833
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:41,007
She give us some work, we make crazy loot.

834
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:43,009
Quick fast, in a hurry.

835
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,511
I don't like that place.

836
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,431
Definitely don't like
that motherfucker, Cadillac.

837
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:51,392
Yo, it ain't about what you like.
You down for the cause or not?

838
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:54,854
I'm down by law, B.
Fantastic Four Plus One all day, but yo...

839
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:58,315
I mean, my uncle, he...
he's a handyman, you know?

840
00:46:58,399 --> 00:46:59,233
He's always hustling.

841
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:01,360
He could hire us for some extra help.

842
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:04,655
We could make money, replace everything
we lost without selling our asses

843
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:06,657
-to Fat Annie and--
-"Selling our ass"?

844
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,951
Yo, who the fuck is selling they ass?
Not me.

845
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:10,786
-No, I'm saying--
-Not me, nigga.

846
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,329
I'm saying let's go see my uncle.

847
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:14,457
I ain't counting pennies
with your damn uncle.

848
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,877
-Well, I ain't working for Fat Annie.
-Then get out my way.

849
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,546
Step aside, nigga.

850
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:24,050
No, I can't. 'Cause you and me,
we a team, remember? I got your back.

851
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:28,512
And not in that fake, corny, "wherever
you go, I go," mack-bullshit kind of way.

852
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:30,056
No, I mean for real.

853
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:31,223
Me, you and the crew.

854
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:34,727
Tonight, Shao, man, we were
the fucking Fantastic Four Plus One.

855
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:38,355
And I quote my DJ when I say one day
we're gonna be bigger than the Yankees,

856
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:41,317
biggest thing in the whole Bronx,
biggest thing in the whole world.

857
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,402
Fantastic Four Plus One
has our own plan of attack.

858
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:45,738
We don't need to sell out
to no gangster motherfuckers--

859
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:49,283
Shut the fuck up, man!
I'm Shaolin Fantastic, B.

860
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,994
I make magic, you make excuses.

861
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:55,956
This ain't Disneyland,
this shit is the fucking Bronx.

862
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,875
Either you be strong, or you be gone.

863
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,419
All I find, all I keep.

864
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:02,922
Either you beat the world,
or you get beat.

865
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:08,511
Yo... you ever see me again...

866
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:11,972
nigga, cross the street.

867
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:15,601
Fucking wordsmith.

868
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:17,853
Wonderbread ass.

869
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,301
<i>A pious man and his gal</i>

870
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:55,516
<i>They had a child</i>

871
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:04,191
<i>Raised in the Bronx</i>

872
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:10,239
<i>In a place so wild</i>

873
00:49:12,408 --> 00:49:14,952
<i>And year after year</i>

874
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,955
<i>The girl has to hear</i>

875
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:21,542
<i>The do's</i>
<i>The don'ts</i>

876
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:25,421
<i>And the dears</i>

877
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,545
<i>Sí,</i> we all love Mrs. Carmela

878
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:10,341
but, well, the church needs more people
like you, Ezekiel.

879
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,385
Talented and lively and bright.

880
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:15,429
We'd be happy to have you
play for us today.

881
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,264
<i>Gracias</i>, Señora Cruz.

882
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:43,040
<i>Mylene, ven aca.</i>

883
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,672
I have examined my soul.

884
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:53,259
I have made a mistake.

885
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,346
I realize it now.

886
00:50:57,429 --> 00:51:01,183
I have nurtured in you
the cardinal sin of pride.

887
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:02,351
What do you mean?

888
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,895
They come to hear you sing, <i>es la verdad.</i>

889
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:11,235
I put you in the spotlight because
I want to fill the seats, to save souls.

890
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:15,447
Ignoring the damage
to my own daughter's soul.

891
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:19,159
From now on, you will sing
at the back of the chorus.

892
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:20,494
What?

893
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,582
-Papi, my solo.
-No, no, no. No more solos.

894
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:27,042
-<i>Por favor</i>, Papi--
-I am sorry.

895
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:29,086
I wish I had come to it sooner.

896
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,630
And may the Lord forgive us both.

897
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,883
Now you go.

898
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,112
Praise him!

899
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,116
<i>A nuestro senor.</i>

900
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:06,623
See the truth. <i>La verdad.</i>

901
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:09,376
Praise him, sister. Praise him, sister.

902
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,669
Yes. Yes.

903
00:52:10,753 --> 00:52:12,671
Thank you, Jesus. Praise him.

904
00:52:12,755 --> 00:52:14,882
<i>A nuestro Señor.</i>

<i>¿Cuál es tu nombre?</i>

907
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:23,974
-Jackie.
-Jackie. Welcome, Jackie.

908
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:28,187
Jackie, the Lord has a message for you.

909
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,397
<i>Paciencia y fe.</i>

910
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:32,232

00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:33,192
<i>Paciencia y fe.</i>

912
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:36,195
Praise him. Praise God.

913
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:38,864
<i>¡Porque murió Jesús Cristo!</i>

914
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:40,282

00:52:40,366 --> 00:52:42,951
<i>¡Porque murió Jesús Cristo!</i>

916
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:49,333
By whose grace do we walk?

917
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:53,003
Praise him. Praise him!

918
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:56,590
Let him fill you with <i>conviccion profunda</i>.

919
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:00,803
Praise him. Praise God.

920
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,942
Let him fill you with the Holy Spirit.

921
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:18,404
<i>Espíritu Santo. Espíritu Santo.</i>

922
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:19,822
Hallelujah!

<i>Yo veo la maldad.</i>

924
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,709
I see the evil in your eyes.

925
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:35,963
You have many talents.
Why do you throw them away?

926
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:40,342
<i>¡Ante la gloria de Dios!</i>

927

Shao, wait up. Shao.

820
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:54,460
Shao.

821
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,673
At least Dizz got a turntable,
you see that?

822
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,634
I mean, it's kind of crispy, but right?

823
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,430
You okay, Shao?

824
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,645
Never better, B.

825
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:15,439
Never better.

826
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,568
You tender-hearted, Books.
I like that about you.

827
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,947
But that shit back there ain't nothing
more than supply and demand.

828
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:26,200
Now we the ones in need of supply
of cash for our new equipment.

829
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,494
And we gotta go out there and demand it.

830
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,621
Shaolin, I should've known
you was already on

831
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:34,083
-to masterminding a new master plan.
-So, what you think?

832
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:38,629
Tomorrow, go to Les Infernos,
see Fat Annie.

833
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:41,007
She give us some work, we make crazy loot.

834
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:43,009
Quick fast, in a hurry.

835
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,511
I don't like that place.

836
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,431
Definitely don't like
that motherfucker, Cadillac.

837
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:51,392
Yo, it ain't about what you like.
You down for the cause or not?

838
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:54,854
I'm down by law, B.
Fantastic Four Plus One all day, but yo...

839
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:58,315
I mean, my uncle, he...
he's a handyman, you know?

840
00:46:58,399 --> 00:46:59,233
He's always hustling.

841
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:01,360
He could hire us for some extra help.

842
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:04,655
We could make money, replace everything
we lost without selling our asses

843
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:06,657
-to Fat Annie and--
-"Selling our ass"?

844
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,951
Yo, who the fuck is selling they ass?
Not me.

845
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:10,786
-No, I'm saying--
-Not me, nigga.

846
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,329
I'm saying let's go see my uncle.

847
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:14,457
I ain't counting pennies
with your damn uncle.

848
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,877
-Well, I ain't working for Fat Annie.
-Then get out my way.

849
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,546
Step aside, nigga.

850
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:24,050
No, I can't. 'Cause you and me,
we a team, remember? I got your back.

851
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:28,512
And not in that fake, corny, "wherever
you go, I go," mack-bullshit kind of way.

852
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:30,056
No, I mean for real.

853
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:31,223
Me, you and the crew.

854
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:34,727
Tonight, Shao, man, we were
the fucking Fantastic Four Plus One.

855
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:38,355
And I quote my DJ when I say one day
we're gonna be bigger than the Yankees,

856
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:41,317
biggest thing in the whole Bronx,
biggest thing in the whole world.

857
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,402
Fantastic Four Plus One
has our own plan of attack.

858
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:45,738
We don't need to sell out
to no gangster motherfuckers--

859
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:49,283
Shut the fuck up, man!
I'm Shaolin Fantastic, B.

860
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,994
I make magic, you make excuses.

861
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:55,956
This ain't Disneyland,
this shit is the fucking Bronx.

862
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,875
Either you be strong, or you be gone.

863
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,419
All I find, all I keep.

864
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:02,922
Either you beat the world,
or you get beat.

865
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:08,511
Yo... you ever see me again...

866
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:11,972
nigga, cross the street.

867
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:15,601
Fucking wordsmith.

868
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:17,853

<i>Mylene, ven aca.</i>

883
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,672
I have examined my soul.

884
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:53,259
I have made a mistake.

885
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,346
I realize it now.

886
00:50:57,429 --> 00:51:01,183
I have nurtured in you
the cardinal sin of pride.

887
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:02,351
What do you mean?

888
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,895
They come to hear you sing, <i>es la verdad.</i>

889
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:11,235
I put you in the spotlight because
I want to fill the seats, to save souls.

890
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:15,447
Ignoring the damage
to my own daughter's soul.

891
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:19,159
From now on, you will sing
at the back of the chorus.

892
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:20,494
What?

893
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,582
-Papi, my solo.
-No, no, no. No more solos.

894
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:27,042
-<i>Por favor</i>, Papi--
-I am sorry.

895
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:29,086
I wish I had come to it sooner.

896
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,630
