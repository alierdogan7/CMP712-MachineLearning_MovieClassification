00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,545
A restored version of

00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:39,824
THE YOUNG GIRLS OF ROCHEFORT

3
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,023
FRIDAY MORNING

4
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,222
Set up here?

5
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,661
That´s all for today, children.

6
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,819
Good-bye, ma´am.

7
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,141
And don´t forget your costumes
tomorrow.

8
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,583
Delphine, come look. They´re here!

9
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,020
They´re setting up on the square.

10
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,746
The girls won´t be ready.
We´ll rehearse Sunday.

11
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,986
- No need to.
- Think so?

12
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,138
<i>We are a pair of twins</i>
<i>Born in the sign of Gemini</i>

13
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,985
<i>Mi fa so la mi re</i>
<i>Re mi fa so so so re do.</i>

14
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:57,859
<i>We´re two demoiselles</i>
<i>Who took to the boys long ago</i>

15
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:02,069
<i>Mi fa so la mi re</i>
<i>Re mi fa so so so re do.</i>

16
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,985
<i>Our mamma brought us up</i>
<i>on her own</i>

17
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:09,745
<i>Working herself all her life</i>
<i>to the bone.</i>

18
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,785
<i>To make sure our minds</i>
<i>could expand</i>

19
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,426
<i>She´s spent all her time</i>
<i>behind a French fry stand.</i>

20
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:21,179
<i>Papa was somebody</i>
<i>that we never knew</i>

21
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:25,229
<i>But when we undress,</i>
<i>one thing is true:</i>

22
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:28,860
<i>ln the small of our backs,</i>
<i>in the very same place</i>

23
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:32,261
<i>There´s the same beauty spot</i>
<i>He had on his face.</i>

24
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:36,025
<i>We are a pair of twins</i>
<i>Born in the sign of Gemini</i>

25
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:43,659
<i>Who love catchy tunes,</i>
<i>silly puns and repartee.</i>

26
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:51,386
<i>We´re a pair</i>
<i>of carefree young things</i>

27
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,340
<i>Waiting for the joys</i>
<i>that love brings.</i>

28
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,106
<i>When our blood races,</i>
<i>When our heart stops,</i>

29
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,701
<i>We´re ready to shout it</i>
<i>from the roof tops.</i>

30
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:06,825
<i>We are delicate souls, two romantics</i>

31
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:10,426
<i>in love with art,</i>
<i>music and antics.</i>

32
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,987
<i>Where´s that man?</i>
<i>The man we long to find.</i>

33
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:17,462
<i>Mr Right...</i>
<i>A few faults we won´t mind.</i>

34
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:21,504
<i>We are a pair of twins</i>
<i>Born in the sign of Gemini.</i>

35
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:29,225
<i>With our feet on the gound</i>
<i>We have flights of fantasy.</i>

36
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:37,265
<i>Teaching piano</i>
<i>is making me turn pale.</i>

37
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,218
<i>l´ve had it up to here</i>
<i>with the sound of bad scales.</i>

38
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:45,019
<i>l´m bored</i>
<i>with these provincial ways.</i>

39
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:48,387
<i>lt´s Paris for me,</i>
<i>where Art really pays.</i>

40
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:52,345
<i>Dancing lessons</i>
<i>are starting to get me down.</i>

41
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:56,219
<i>My chance is in Paris too,</i>
<i>not in this town.</i>

42
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,019
<i>Why teach pliés</i>
<i>and pirouettes all day</i>

43
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,148
<i>When l could be in the Opera Ballet?</i>

44
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:07,343
<i>We are a pair of twins</i>
<i>Born in the sign of Gemini.</i>

45
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:14,979
<i>Two hearts, four eyes</i>
<i>Ready to rhapsodize.</i>

46
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,064
Quarter to 12! I´m late!

47
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,027
Delphine! Pick up Booboo?

48
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,340
- Can´t you?
- I´ll go at 4.

49
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:29,707
I can´t wear this!
Sure, I can... No, I can´t.

50
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,022
Guillaume will be waiting.

51
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,340
- What´s he want?
- To see me.

52
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,909
Let him wait.

53
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,309
Home for lunch?

54
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,984
Yes, but not before 1.

55
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,664
Where´s my compact?
Here it is...

56
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:52,703
<i>We play the cello,</i>
<i>the trumpet and the banjo.</i>

57
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,499
<i>We love catchy tunes,</i>
<i>silly puns and repartee.</i>

58
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,299
<i>With our feet on the ground</i>
<i>We have flights of fantasy.</i>

59
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,145
<i>We are a pair of twins</i>
<i>Born in the sign of Gemini.</i>

60
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,584
See you later.

61
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,341
- Where you off to?
- The café.

62
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,863
Wait for us.

63
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,219
Fries?

64
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,743
Two orders of fries.

65
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,300
- Fair time?
- We just arrived.

66
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,462
- It´ll boost business.
- No need to.

67
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,788
- We´re going for a walk.
- Not now!

68
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,863
We´re not on call.

69
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,068
What slackers!

70
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,102
How you treat your ladies!

71
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,784
They aren´t our ladies...
not really.

72
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,384
Performers?

73
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:38,862
The blonde does an Indian shimmy,
the redhead a Chinese shimmy.

74
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,339
- It´s harder.
- How interesting...

75
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:45,466
He´s the boss.
I second him. I´m a mechanic.

76
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,943
- Hello, Yvonne.
- Hello, Maxence.

77
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,668
Hello, Josette. Hello, Gramps.

78
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,105
- Still abstract?
- More than ever.

79
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,862
He was born that way.

80
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,266
In 3 days I´m demobbed.

81
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,948
- A Pimm´s.
- We´re out.

82
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,948
- Aren´t we?
- But he can order something else.

83
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,145
A beer.

84
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:17,905
- So, did you find her?
- Not yet, but I can wait.

85
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,102
A beer for Maxence.

86
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,783
- Did he find her?
- Not yet.

87
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,510
- What´d he lose?
- His feminine ideal.

88
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,740
He never found her to begin with!

89
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,983
He painted her. He´s a painter-poet.
He´s stationed here.

90
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,865
We all seek our feminine ideal.
He´s not the only one.

91
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:46,505
Don´t be so sad, Maxence.
Girls are a dime a dozen.

92
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:53,060
<i>l´ve searched all over for her,</i>
<i>l´ve sailed the seven seas</i>

93
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:58,504
<i>From Venice to Java,</i>
<i>from Manilla to Angkor.</i>

94
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:04,308
<i>There was Jeanne and Victoria,</i>
<i>Venus and Mona Lisa.</i>

95
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:10,307
<i>l haven´t found her yet,</i>
<i>l seek her even more.</i>

96
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:15,419
<i>l don´t know what she´s like</i>
<i>and yet her image is clear.</i>

97
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:20,346
<i>l have a name for her,</i>
<i>her voice is in my ear.</i>

98
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:26,307
<i>l´ve sketched her silhouette,</i>
<i>the face l´m dreaming of.</i>

99
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:31,703
<i>The portrait that l´ve done</i>
<i>is the very image of love.</i>

100
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:37,903
<i>She is as gracious</i>
<i>as only romantic girls can be.</i>

101
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:42,985
<i>A Botticelli beauty</i>
<i>with such eyes, such poise.</i>

102
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:48,065
<i>In profile she is like</i>
<i>those virgins of mythology</i>

103
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:53,827
<i>Who haunt museum galleries</i>
<i>and the dreams of teenage boys.</i>

104
00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:01,101
<i>Her stride is so much like</i>
<i>a childhood memory</i>

105
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:06,344
<i>That passes my mind´s eye</i>
<i>lilting, dreamily.</i>

106
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:11,868
<i>Her hair pours down her brow</i>
<i>like torrents of pure gold</i>

107
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:18,344
<i>Round which wind, sea and sun</i>
<i>quarrel for a hold.</i>

108
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:24,385
<i>I could tell you</i>
<i>of her hands, of her eyes.</i>

109
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:29,578
<i>I could go on and on</i>
<i>until the next sunrise.</i>

110
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:35,986
<i>She is my only love,</i>
<i>but what good is a dream?</i>

111
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:42,864
<i>I´ve searched all over</i>
<i>but she´s nowhere to be seen.</i>

112
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:49,383
<i>He could tell us</i>
<i>of her hands, of her eyes.</i>

113
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:55,429
<i>He could go on and on</i>
<i>until the next sunrise.</i>

114
00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:01,747
<i>She is his only love</i>
<i>but what good is a dream?</i>

115
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:08,424
<i>He´s searched all over</i>
<i>but she´s nowhere to be seen.</i>

116
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:15,783
<i>Can she be far?</i>
<i>Is she close to me?</i>

117
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:21,469
<i>I couldn´t say</i>
<i>but I know she does exist.</i>

118
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:27,228
<i>Is she a wicked girl?</i>
<i>Or born to royalty?</i>

119
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:33,466
<i>Her pedigree means nothing,</i>
<i>because I am an artist,</i>

120
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:39,700
<i>And Love is the sole authority.</i>

121
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,669
Nice portrait,
but no one like that here.

122
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,424
- No, no one.
- I prefer redheads.

123
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,740
- Heavens! Have you seen Delphine?
- No, ma´am.

124
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,663
I bet she forgot to pick up Booboo.

125
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,509
Could you go, Maxence?

126
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,343
I´m already late for maneuvers.

127
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,142
I have to set the tables.

128
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,301
- I´m sorry.
- Never mind.

129
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,463
´Bye, Gramps.

130
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:19,788
Could you two gentlemen go?
The school´s around the corner.

131
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,429
Sure, we don´t mind.

132
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,706
You´re sweet. Just ask for Booboo.

133
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:27,419
- Who?
- Booboo... He´s my son, my youngest.

134
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,740
I´m afraid I can never go out.

135
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:32,788
I´m confined to this aquarium.

136
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:39,066
Me, who was meant to live in
the open air on the Pacific shore,

137
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:42,549
listening to sweet music
and reading poetry.

138
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,780
Yvonne, I´m out of glue.

139
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,708
Could you buy some glue
on the way? Thanks.

140
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,379
Hi, Delphe!

141
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:22,029
You´re filthy!
Look at you! And in your new pants!

142
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,665
- Are you Booboo?
- Why do you ask?

143
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,582
We came to fetch Booboo.

144
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,586
- Says who?
- The lady in the café.

145
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,140
- What nerve!
- We´re straight.

146
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,908
We came with the fair.

147
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,663
I bet you did!

148
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:39,382
- You´re quite pretty.
- So I´ve been told!

149
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,586
- You´ll split your dress.
- Quiet!

150
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,706
So, do we take the kid?

151
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,747
- I wanna go with them.
- You kidnappers?

152
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,743
- We wouldn´t say if we were.
- Smart aleck!

153
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,459
Actually, it suits me because...
Never mind!

154
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:55,548
Behave yourself. Bye, pumpkin.

155
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,024
- Your aunt´s swell!
- She´s my sister!

156
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,703
She´s a honey!

157
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,429
I want some candy.

158
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,027
We gonna stand here all day?

159
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:08,944
Hello, dear rose.

160
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:13,309
- You´re lovely, dear soul.
- By "soul" you mean my body.

161
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,347
You´re so right, dear heart.

162
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,867
If I weren´t so in love with you,
I´d be jealous.

163
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:22,547
But I love you
and that fills me with pride...

164
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,302
And craving, since I want you.

165
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,466
I inspire your baser feellings.

166
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,741
And gluttony and lust.

167
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,942
And prattle.
You love to hear yourself talk.

168
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,301
Myself and yourself. I love you.

169
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,581
That why you wanted to see me?

170
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,389
You don´t love me,
but you´ll marry me.

171
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,546
I already said no, Guillaume.

172
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:46,941
- So why do you come?
- You´re so entertaining.

173
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,819
But if you prefer, I´ll stop coming.

174
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,145
Why, that´s me!

175
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,745
Yes, dear rose.

176
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,984
Since when do you pose for soldiers?

177
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,744
Soldiers? What´s this nonsense?

178
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:02,265
- Who painted it?
- I said, a soldier.

179
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:06,389
Calls himself a painter and poet.
Get the picture? Know him?

180
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,184
An uncanny likeness,
don´t you think?

181
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,419
Mere coincidence.

182
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,263
- But it´s me all over!
- No, it´s just figurative.

183
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,785
You´re spiritual, dear soul.

184
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:21,139
It´s a worthless picture,
pure fantasy.

185
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,108
He modestly calls it
"Feminine Ideal".

186
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:30,381
He must really love me to dream me
up like this. What´s he like?

187
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:33,384
Dull, insignificant.

188
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,223
I want to meet him.

189
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:38,979
Sorry. He just left for Paris.

190
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,701
But he´s not your type at all.

191
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:45,260
<i>You think you know me,</i>
<i>you like to talk a lot</i>

192
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:48,581
<i>But really you do not not not...</i>

193
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:53,380
<i>You don´t know how l feel.</i>
<i>If you did know you´d reel.</i>

194
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,862
<i>You´ll never know.</i>

195
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,543
<i>I know how you think!</i>

196
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,782
<i>You´ll never know</i>
<i>what tickles me pink pink pink.</i>

197
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:06,626
<i>What makes me play</i>
<i>Or why I dream night and day.</i>

198
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:10,223
<i>I´m just a doll in your gallery.</i>

199
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:13,826
<i>What did you ever see in me?</i>

200
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:16,629
<i>You find my chatter</i>
<i>tedious and dumb.</i>

201
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:20,100
<i>You couldn´t care less</i>
<i>if I´m cheerful or glum.</i>

202
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,505
<i>Doubts are something</i>
<i>you don´t show.</i>

203
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:27,662
<i>I´m a fool,</i>
<i>whether I say yes or no no no.</i>

204
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:32,506
<i>You say: "I live only for money."</i>
<i>And then you say you love me.</i>

205
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,748
<i>If you really loved me...</i>

206
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,468
<i>But I tell you every day...</i>

207
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:40,702
<i>If you really love me</i>
<i>as you say say say...</i>

208
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:45,739
<i>When you tire of me</i>
<i>You say: "Excuse me, time is money!"</i>

209
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:49,308
<i>But time for me is love, my friend.</i>

210
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,985
<i>It´s laughter and song</i>
<i>until the day´s end,</i>

211
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:58,986
<i>and love each night since Creation.</i>
<i>Time is love, life is celebration.</i>

212
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:03,668
<i>So...so stop thinking</i>
<i>that I´ll be your prize.</i>

213
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,822
<i>You lie when</i>
<i>you sentimentalize, lies, lies...</i>

214
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:11,905
<i>Buy other girls a drink, you´ll</i>
<i>find love for the price of a mink.</i>

215
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:15,028
<i>Then you´ll forget me.</i>

216
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,828
<i>It´s simpler than you think...</i>

217
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:20,027
<i>Any girl will give you</i>
<i>a wink wink wink.</i>

218
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:25,423
<i>It may be a girl with velvety voice</i>
<i>But love for her is on an invoice.</i>

219
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:32,059
<i>Excuse me for being so blunt,</i>
<i>I won´t put feelings up front.</i>

220
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,950
<i>Let´s not drag it out</i>
<i>for both our sakes,</i>

221
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:38,819
<i>Let´s make it a friendly break.</i>

222
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,623
Farewell, Guillaume.

223
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,143
Good-bye, dear heart.

224
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:09,142
Your eyes are the same blue
as the picture.

225
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,107
- I can´t help it.
- Aren´t they?

226
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,784
You like blue eyes,
so you can tell.

227
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:16,589
I´ve never seen anything like them.

228
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:20,980
How odd! It can´t be abstract
if it resembIes his eyes...

229
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:24,859
Which aren´t abstract,
so this picture sees you as I do.

230
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,019
Look, Mom!

231
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:45,348
- You shouldn´t have!
- It´s nothing.

232
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,069
Thanks.

233
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:52,748
- Here you go, Gramps.
- How kind of you.

234
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,825
- Will you have a drink?
- Why not?

235
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,623
We met a knockout blonde!

236
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:01,020
- Your sister.
- I don´t have a sister.

237
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:04,660
- He means Delphe.
- Delphine... my daughter.

238
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,906
- She´s a peach!
- So are you!

239
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,299
So I´ve been told.

240
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,501
S.O.S.! Storm at sea!

241
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,109
Be quiet, Booboo.

242
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,269
Hello, Dutrouz!

243
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,659
Hello, everyone.

244
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:20,139
They´re friends.
Subtil Dutrouz.

245
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:23,541
"Subtil" like a scent,
Dutrouz with a silent "z".

246
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:26,986
- Bill as in billiards.
- Etienne like everyone else.

247
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,027
- Here, for you.
- What is it?

248
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,340
A plastic atomic submarine.

249
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,262
- How´s it holding?
- Fine.

250
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:34,864
That´s good.

251
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:39,262
I just saw them tramping by,
armed to the teeth.

252
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,783
They´d shoot us like rabbits.

253
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,987
- What´ll you have?
- Nothing, I´m off.

254
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,742
I´ll be back later.

255
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,538
- Who´s that?
- A friend of Gramps´.

256
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,621
- What´s he do?
- Retired.

257
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,749
- What exactly do you do?
- Us?

258
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:59,505
<i>We go from place to place,</i>
<i>With motorcycles to sell,</i>

259
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:02,742
<i>Bikes and boats as well.</i>
<i>The road´s our home base.</i>

260
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,822
<i>Today we´re here,</i>
<i>Tomorrow there.</i>

261
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:08,300
<i>We live free as the air,</i>
<i>Like boys without a care.</i>

262
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:13,419
<i>On the move, having fun,</i>
<i>Avoiding shadows for the sun.</i>

263
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:16,787
<i>We prefer what is sweet, not sour,</i>

264
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:20,659
<i>A pretty girl, not a wall flower,</i>

265
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,782
<i>And pleasure, not despair.</i>

266
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:27,626
<i>We flit from face to face</i>
<i>Like bees among the flowers.</i>

267
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:31,100
<i>In each port, a pretty girl,</i>
<i>In each town, some tender hours.</i>

268
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:34,746
<i>We live on the heady brine,</i>
<i>a baker´s loaf, a sip of wine,</i>

269
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:38,300
<i>The morning haze, the evening storm,</i>

270
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,060
<i>A child´s smile to make us warm,</i>

271
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:44,984
<i>The siesta at mid-day,</i>

272
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,626
<i>Making love in the hay,</i>

273
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,910
<i>The wind on our face.</i>

274
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:55,826
<i>We go from town to town,</i>
<i>The future´s an unknown.</i>

275
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:59,346
<i>A pretty girl lends a hand</i>
<i>And life is grand.</i>

276
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,102
<i>Today here,</i>
<i>Tomorrow there.</i>

277
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:04,546
<i>Our life´s a romance,</i>
<i>A melody composed by chance,</i>

278
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,143
<i>Full of new delights.</i>

279
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,978
<i>We prefer joy to misery,</i>

280
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:12,745
<i>Intelligence to stupidity,</i>

281
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:16,307
<i>Straight talk to hypocrisy,</i>

282
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,380
<i>And gentle arms to gendarmes.</i>

283
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:23,620
<i>We go from fair to fair,</i>
<i>Folks point and stare.</i>

284
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:27,066
<i>They call us carnies</i>
<i>But poets are what we are.</i>

285
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,107
<i>Today we frown,</i>
<i>Tomorrow laugh.</i>

286
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:32,501
<i>Life´s a double bill,</i>
<i>A tragedy of fate,</i>

287
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:37,221
<i>A comedy of good will.</i>
<i>As friends we will grow old,</i>

288
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:43,984
<i>Knights without fear or blame,</i>
<i>We haven´t a penny to our name,</i>

289
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,183
<i>But our hearts are made of gold.</i>

290
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:51,660
<i>We go from place to place,</i>
<i>Across rivers and valleys.</i>

291
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:55,618
<i>They call us carnies,</i>
<i>The r</i>o<i>ad is</i> o<i>ur h</i>o<i>me base.</i>

292
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:10,068
- What´s wrong?
- I´m sad and bored.

293
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,140
You´re hiding something.

294
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,625
It´s over with GuiIIaume.

295
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,702
That´s good news!
I never Iiked the guy.

296
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,065
Know what I´m thinking?

297
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,302
Yes, about your dream man.

298
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:23,459
How´d you guess?

299
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,906
It´s easy, darIing...

300
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:30,220
You have that ´´dream man´´ Iook
on your face.

301
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:36,067
<i>l kn</i>o<i>w n</i>o<i>thing</i> o<i>f him</i>

304
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:51,863
<i>The l</i>oo<i>k in his eyes</i>

305
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:57,181
<i>He is hands</i>o<i>me</i>

306
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:01,781
<i>Like divine Raphael</i>

307
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:06,978
<i>A philos</i>o<i>pher</i>

<i>And resist l never will.</i>

318
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:10,342
Sweetie, guys Iike that
don´t hang out in Rochefort.

319
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,705
Not right now.
He´s in Paris. He did my portrait.

320
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,106
Who is it? You never mentioned him.

321
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,785
A painter. I don´t know him.

322
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,141
He exists and he Ioves me.

323
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,982
But I´ve never seen him.

324
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,822
- You´re iII!
- I´m serious.

325
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:29,185
- To Paris, then!
- And our pupiIs?

326
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,306
- Our careers first!
- Without money?

327
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:35,748
Never mind, for now we´re free!
We Ieave for Paris next week.

328
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,418
This afternoon
I´II go see Mr Dame...

329
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,383
What´s so funny?

330
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,859
Nothing. It´s such a siIIy name.

331
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,703
He´s very nice.
He knows Andrew MiIIer.

332
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:49,062
- Who´s that?
- Dunno...

333
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:53,059
An American composer.
They went to schooI together.

334
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:56,467
Andrew MiIIer is giving
some recitaIs in Paris

335
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:59,423
and Simon Dame
wiII teII him about me.

336
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:02,229
In a Ietter...
Then I´II get Booboo.

337
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:05,502
No need to.
Mom sent two guys this morning.

338
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:08,059
I went for nothing.
Booboo Ieft with them.

339
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:11,263
You Iet Booboo go off
with two strangers?

340
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:15,458
The town´s crawIing
with soIdiers, sadists and painters!

341
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:18,020
You´II never get a man, oId girI.

342
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:23,339
You were born 12 min. Iater!
Don´t ´´oId girI´´ me! As for men...

343
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,989
- That´s it!
- What?

344
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,425
I´ve got the theme for my concerto!

345
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,109
Good day, sisters.

346
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,421
Schubert´s ´´Ave Maria.´´

347
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,704
Here we are.

348
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,706
- Is that aII?
- Yes, thank you.

349
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,869
Good-bye, Mr Dame.

350
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,700
- HeIIo, Mr Dame.
- HeIIo, miss.

351
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,585
Your music paper arrived.

352
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,866
I´m sorry about the deIay.

353
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:29,466
Setting up this store
has taken a Iot out of me.

354
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,781
Rochefort isn´t Paris,
and I haven´t adapted yet.

355
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,224
It Iooks reaIIy nice.

356
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:37,985
I´ve tried to recreate
a musicaI atmosphere.

357
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,948
Now where did I put it?
Here it is.

358
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:46,382
- Ready for the fair?
- The girIs rehearse daiIy.

359
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:49,784
I wrote a IittIe piece for them,

360
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,180
a 3-part choraI in C minor.

361
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:53,749
How much is it?

362
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,059
12 francs.

363
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,103
PIease caII me Simon.

364
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,226
ReaIIy?

365
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,548
My name´s so siIIy.

366
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,781
I´m caIIed SoIange.

367
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:08,262
The key of so

368
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:11,502
and the fIight of angeIs.
The name suits you.

369
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:16,384
I have a favor to ask.

370
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,739
Go ahead.

371
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:20,378
I pIan to go to Paris next week.

372
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:23,223
You hinted, Iast Tuesday,

373
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:27,861
you couId recommend me to your
friend, Andrew MiIIer, the composer.

374
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:32,706
Andy... certainIy. I haven´t
seen him since Conservatory.

375
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,421
After schooI,
Andrew went back to the States

376
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:39,423
and found fame and fortune...

377
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:42,024
Life´s come between us.

378
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:47,462
It´s a chance he´s in France.
I´II write him straight away.

379
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,302
I´m sure he can heIp you.

380
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:56,188
You´II become a great composer,
SoIange. A great composer.

381
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,423
I hope so.

382
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:03,778
I have the 3rd movement
for my concerto in F sharp minor.

383
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,539
- Care to hear it?
- With pIeasure.

384
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,424
AdmirabIe!

385
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:03,063
What texture, originaIity, passion!
What force! What Iyricism!

386
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,186
I Iike it a Iot, too.

387
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:10,022
- When do you Ieave?
- Monday, after the fair.

388
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,861
Don´t take it badIy,

389
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:16,985
but when my fiancée
Ieft 10 years ago

390
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:21,344
I feIt the same twinge in my heart.

391
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,499
Your fiancée?

392
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,942
It was because of her
that I Ieft Paris.

393
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:31,180
I moved here Iast month
to reIive my memories.

394
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,989
Does she Iive in Rochefort?

395
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,949
No, in Mexico.

396
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,221
But we met here.

397
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:42,909
It´s a strange story
for an ordinary man Iike me.

398
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:48,741
<i>My fiancee f</i>o<i>und my name</i>

399

<i>lt fills a man with pride,</i>

405
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:20,659
<i>But she c</i>o<i>uldn´t stand</i>

406
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:26,826
<i>Yet she cared f</i>o<i>r me</i>

407
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:30,983
<i>But l had n</i>o <i>idea</i>

<i>Living with my mem</i>o<i>ries</i>
<i>and my heart at bay.</i>

422
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,789
- You never saw her again?
- Never.

423
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:46,224
She must be Iiving it up
in AcapuIco.

424
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,221
She worshipped the sun.

425
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:51,106
But I go on and on...

426
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,940
I´II write to Andy.
I hope he hasn´t forgotten me.

427
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:58,499
- Maybe his head sweIIed.
- What?

428
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:00,626
He may be pretentious.

429
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:03,823
No, Andy was a bright feIIow.

430
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:06,699
Besides, I´m sure you´II Iike him.

431
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,418
4 o´cIock, aIready!

432
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,302
I doubt she´II come.

433
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,267
The kid can´t waIk home aIone!

434
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,545
Excuse me!

435
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,388
Let the young Iady by.

436
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,221
- Hi, SoIange.
- Hi, pumpkin.

437
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,063
Your sIip is showing.

438
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,741
Fighting again! Look at you!

439
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,588
You naughty boy!

440
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:07,223
- Hi, Booboo.
- So you came?

441
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:10,462
- What do you want?
- We´ve come to fetch Booboo.

442
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,745
These are my buddies.

443
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:13,582
We came with the fair.

444
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,627
- When do you Ieave?
- Monday.

445
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,508
Then, bon voyage!

446
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:22,541
- Miss! Your sIip is showing.
- So I´ve been toId.

447
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:24,422
Your aunt´s not nice.

448
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,029
She´s my sister.

449
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:28,182
She sure has changed!

450
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,749
Come on, skip it.

451
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:31,901
They buy me candy.

452
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:33,469
I´II get you Iicorice.

453
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,348
I want to go with them!

454
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:37,263
Then no Iicorice!

455
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:58,098
I´m sorry.

456
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:02,422
Don´t mention it.

457
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,542
- Are you a musician?
- Yes.

458
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,105
Good-bye.

459
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:24,626
Miss, your sIip is showing.

460
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:28,025
I know, but it doesn´t matter.

461
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,782
Miss...

462
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:34,507
- Can I see you again?
- I don´t know.

463
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:37,182
I don´t think so.

464
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:41,578
Come on.

465
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:44,268
That guy´s got some nerve!

466
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,382

We can´t go
without saying good-bye.

480
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:39,943
- My heart´s racing.
- That´s normaI.

481
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:44,467
Look: First, I´ve had it.
Second, they expIoit us.

482
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:48,418
Third, I don´t Iove Etienne.
Fourth, BiII´s eyes aren´t bIue.

483
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:51,309
Fifth, adventure beckons.
And sixth...

Here they come!

485
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:58,223
What´s with you?

486
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:00,665
Can´t you see? We´re Ieaving.

487
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,589
- What?
- We´re Ieaving.

488
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:05,264
- With who?
- Two saiIors.

489
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:08,703
Don´t whine, it´s pointIess.

490
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:10,428
They´re dumb.

491
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:13,309
We Iove them,
but that´s not the worst.

492
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:17,669
We give them a goIden opportunity
and they cut out before a show.

493
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:19,946
And for who? SaiIors!

494
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:26,269
<i>Sail</i>o<i>rs give us a better time</i>
<i>Than all y</i>o<i>ur carnies c</i>o<i>mbined.</i>

495
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:31,220
<i>- Sail</i>o<i>rs aren´t the marrying kind.</i>
<i>- But as l</i>o<i>vers they´re just fine.</i>

496
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:36,339
<i>As friend, l</i>o<i>ver</i> o<i>r husband</i>
<i>Sail</i>o<i>rs are absent all the time.</i>

497
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:42,470

<i>But it g</i>o<i>t its wires crossed</i>

498
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:47,704

<i>On the bed</i> o<i>f</i> o<i>ur l</i>o<i>nely nights.</i>

499
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:53,149
<i>With the faded roses it tossed</i>
<i>On the bed</i> o<i>f</i> o<i>ur l</i>o<i>nely nights.</i>

517
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:28,549
You thought it over?

518
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:36,505
<i>We flit fr</i>o<i>m face t</i>o <i>face</i>

520
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:44,384
<i>F</i>o<i>r us life´s a cinch...</i>

521
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:56,580
Braque, Picasso, KIee,
Miro, Matisse...

522
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:58,502
That´s Iife!

523
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:00,581
Sure, Iife!

524
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:02,468
But how do you manage?

525
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:04,746
Don´t teII me
you paint in the barracks!

526
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:07,868
No one paints in barracks!

527
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:11,182
I have a room in town.
It´s my studio.

528
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:15,829
Every night I go AWOL,
and I go home and paint.

529
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:20,019
Next week I go to Paris.
And in 6 months: a show!

530
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:22,619
- If you´re reIeased.
- That´s not funny!

531
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:27,545
There´s troubIe everywhere, Iike in
´39. That´s how it started in ´39.

532
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:30,907
I saw you this morning
doing your cIown act.

533
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:34,182
We were on maneuvers.
Think I enjoy it?

534
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:35,703
Cut it out!

535
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:38,338
Next week I´m a civiIian. Freedom!

536
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:40,660
Monday. Right, Yvonne?

537
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:45,186
It´s sad to see everyone Ieave.

538
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:47,181
Why everyone?

539
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:49,829
No speciaI reason.

540
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:52,980
It reminds me of my past.

541
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:55,540
It´s none of your business,
of course.

542
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:58,221
You´II break that chair.

543
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:00,621
A past Iove, I suppose?

544
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:02,542
What eIse?

545
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:05,579
It was...

546
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:09,261
a secret passion.

547
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:12,221
I never toId anyone.

548
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:14,866
No one ever found out.

549
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:16,705
Not even my daughters.

550
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:19,708
Your daughters!
I´ve heard so much about them.

551
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:22,504
- I´d Iike to meet them.
- Hush up!

552
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:27,186
And this passion went sour,
if I get your meaning.

553
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:32,222
<i>My fiancé had a name</i>
<i>that was grating t</i>o <i>the ear,</i>

554
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:36,429
<i>An irritating name</i>
<i>that was m</i>o<i>re than l c</i>o<i>uld bear.</i>

555
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:40,748
<i>S</i>o <i>l went and left him</i>

556
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:44,983
<i>lt´s been 10 years n</i>o<i>w</i>

<i>n</i>o <i>l</i>o<i>nger tw</i>o <i>but three.</i>

559
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:57,709
<i>lt´s a w</i>o<i>man´s greatest claim,</i>
<i>lt fills a man with pride.</i>

560
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:02,182
<i>B</i>oo<i>b</i>oo<i>, the p</i>oo<i>r dear,</i>

562
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:12,543
<i>Even th</i>o<i>ugh l had twins</i>

563
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:17,068
<i>He never met the girls,</i>
<i>l kept them</i> o<i>ut</i> o<i>f sight.</i>

564
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:21,269
<i>They went t</i>o <i>b</i>o<i>arding sch</i>oo<i>l</i>
<i>and never came h</i>o<i>me at night.</i>

565
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:25,623

568
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:38,902

572
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:59,825
<i>living amid mem</i>o<i>ries,</i>
<i>my life´s debris.</i>

573
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:03,945
You don´t know
what became of him?

574
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:06,863
No. He´s probabIy in Paris.

575
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:09,790
You shouId try and find him.

576
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:13,579
What was this monster´s name?

577
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:17,343
Dame. Simon Dame.

578
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:20,059
I´d have become Madame Dame.
Absurd!

579
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:21,424
He was a bastard!

580
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:23,421
Not at aII, Papa, caIm down!

581
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:25,143
A bastard!

582
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:28,706
Maybe so,
but he had a charming name.

583
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:30,269
´´Madame Dame.´´

584
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:32,462
It´s amusing.

585
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:35,828
- So I did wrong?
- I didn´t say that.

586
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:43,582
- ShaII we?
- It´s figurative?

587
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:48,747
I toId you: it´s my onIy figurative
work. The abstracts are at camp.

588
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:53,224
Coming with us?

589
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:55,620
- To see my feminine ideaI.
- Where?

590
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:59,624
On show at GuiIIaume Lancien´s
gaIIery. Around the corner.

591
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:01,348
Sorry, I reaIIy can´t.

592
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:04,388
- You snub my work.
- No, I don´t.

593
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:07,220
So Iong! Coming?

594
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:22,745
- You´ve been crying!
- Not at aII.

595
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:24,787
Don´t Iie, I can teII.

596
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:37,664
- I Iike your hat.
- So do I.

597
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:40,829
Is that aII that´s new?

598
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:43,498
I´m fIustered:
I just met my dream man.

599
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:46,498
Otherwise, we´re working.

600
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:49,659
I haven´t seen DeIphine in 3 days.

601
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:51,189
We´re hard at work!

602
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:54,467
Next week we´re off to Paris.

603
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:57,827
I´m joining the Concert HaII,
and DeIphine the Opera.

604
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:02,744
- We´re not going to rot here!
- You´re oId enough to know.

605
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:07,502
Dutrouz´s right:
there´s troubIe everywhere.

606
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:10,309
Why this urge to fight aII the time?

607
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:12,588
I forgot my beret.

608
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:15,149
So Iong, Maxence!

609
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:19,629
Who´s that?

610
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:23,066
Maxence. A painter
doing his miIitary service.

611
00:56:25,350 --> 00:56:28,820
Get down! I toId you
not to waIk on the tabIes!

612
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:33,938
Leaving aIready?

613
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:35,907
I´m going home. ´Bye, Mom!

614
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:38,260
Come for dinner tomorrow.
Dutrouz wiII be there.

615
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:40,864
- Who´s Dutrouz?
- Don´t know him?

616
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:44,138
A friend of Gramps´
from back in ´24.

617
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:47,302
They met Iast week
for the first time in 40 years!

618
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:49,381
- See you tomorrow.
- TiII then!

619
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:52,546
You again?

620
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:57,388
Your sister´s charming.

621
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:00,705
- She´s my daughter.
- Her, too?

622
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:04,147
I had twins by a first Iover,
but they´re not identicaI.

623
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:06,460
Then I had Booboo, much Iater.

624
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:07,949
Another Iover...

625
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:10,021
Be poIite, I´m not in the mood.

626
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:12,750
We aren´t either. We´ve got troubIe.

627
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,739
- Is that so?
- The girIs Ieft us.

628
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:18,947
- The girIs?
- The ones you saw this morning.

629
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:23,467
They do a number for us,
not bad in fact, to draw customers.

630
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:25,064
The Asian shimmy.

631
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:28,867
That´s right.
So now we´re up the creek.

632
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:32,221
You won´t find anyone here
to do an Asian shimmy.

633
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:34,341
That, or something eIse.

634
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:36,667
Your daughters couId heIp us.

635
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:38,582
Don´t count on it!

636
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:40,183
They can dance, no?

637
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:42,024
DeIphine dances...

638
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:45,944
SoIange soI-fas. She writes music.
She can dance, too.

639
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:48,021
- But they won´t do it.
- Think so?

640
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:52,303
I´m sure of it. With their taIent,
they won´t rot here.

641
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:54,700
Next week they´re off to Paris.

642
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:57,420
- What´II it be?
- White wine?

643
00:57:58,030 --> 00:57:59,224
Two gIasses.

644
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:03,423
It wouIdn´t hurt to ask.

645
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:06,741
- It´s worth a try.
- Nothing ventured...

646
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:11,868
Oh, my God!

647
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:16,145
One of Booboo´s pranks.

648
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:25,425
That´s her.

649
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:27,868
Your ideaI?

650
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:31,784
I once knew a young Iady

651
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:34,259
who Iooked a bit Iike that.

652
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:36,622
A dancer.

653
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:40,021
This was 40 years ago.

654
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:43,502
But she was a brunette,
with short hair.

655
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:45,269
Not at aII aIike!

656
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:47,068
Not reaIIy.

657
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:51,068
A sIight resembIance, here.

658
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:54,899
I don´t know anyone Iike that.

659
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:57,869
You won´t find that sort
in Rochefort.

660

Where?

677
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:55,579
In the street.

SureIy a foreigner or a tourist.

703
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:19,178
- Why? Did he have an accent?
- I don´t remember.

704
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:20,908
- A camera?
- No.

705
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:22,503
So why an American?

706
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:25,389
I said a foreigner, not an American.

707
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:27,541
Not aII foreigners are American.

708
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:29,541
But they´re often tourists.

709
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:31,627
Good Lord! What if it´s him?

710
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:37,229
It´s JuIes and Jim!

711
01:03:39,710 --> 01:03:41,541
You again! You know them?

712
01:03:41,710 --> 01:03:43,780
We´ve aIready met.

Don´t stand there, I´m coId.

714
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:49,379
What do you want?

715
01:03:49,550 --> 01:03:52,622
- WeII, your mother, Yvonne...
- Yeah, right...

716
01:03:52,790 --> 01:03:54,985
- Let them taIk.
- Yes, Iet us.

717
01:03:55,150 --> 01:03:58,938
Your mother, Yvonne,
said you were going to Paris.

718
01:03:59,110 --> 01:03:59,906
That´s right.

719
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:02,026
And you needed someone
to take you.

720
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:03,225
We never said that!

721
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:05,620
Anyway, we can take you.

722
01:04:05,830 --> 01:04:07,707
- In the truck?
- There are bunks.

723
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:09,343
I can see it now!

724
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:11,860
- We´re serious.
- What a come-on!

725
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:14,345
WeII... Is that aII?

726
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:18,060
- We want to make a deaI.
- But not in the doorway.

727
01:04:19,950 --> 01:04:21,383
Take these.

728
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:37,578
WeII?

729
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:40,105
TeII them.
After aII, it´s your idea.

730
01:04:40,270 --> 01:04:41,703
But you´re the boss.

731
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:43,542
We´re in no hurry.

732
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:45,544
WeII...

733
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:50,347
To Iiven up our stand at the fair
we thought...

734
01:04:50,910 --> 01:04:52,741
It was BiII´s idea...

735
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:54,548
We thought that maybe

736
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:57,986
you couId do a number...
Something IiveIy.

737
01:04:58,470 --> 01:04:59,459
A number?

738
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:02,190
- They think we´re strippers!
- ObviousIy.

739
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:06,140
The fact is, the performers we hired

740
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:08,460
Ieft us high and dry
at the Iast minute,

741
01:05:08,630 --> 01:05:10,302
and we need...

742
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:12,387
- Stand-ins.
- Just Iike that.

743
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:14,064
That´s right.

744
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:15,982
So, interested?

745
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:20,425
Interested isn´t the word.
But we´II think it over.

746
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:23,150
We´re quite busy at the moment.

747
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:25,142
Does that mean ´´yes´´ or ´´no´´?

748
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:28,741
- What do you think?
- But what do they want?

749
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:31,743
- Something IiveIy.
- You said that aIready.

750
01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:40,981

01:21:49,310 --> 01:21:53,428
<i>l´d have liked</i>
<i>t</i>o <i>fight f</i>o<i>r true treasures.</i>

932
01:21:53,590 --> 01:21:57,139
<i>l´d sacrifice it all</i>
<i>f</i>o<i>r tender pleasures.</i>

933
01:21:57,310 --> 01:22:00,859
<i>l didn´t have L</i>o<i>ve</i>
<i>but L</i>o<i>ve is here t</i>o<i>day</i>

934
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:05,387
<i>Every since that girl came my way.</i>

935
01:22:08,870 --> 01:22:14,388
<i>Can she be far?</i>
<i>ls she near t</i>o <i>me?</i>

936
01:22:14,910 --> 01:22:19,938
<i>l never saw her again</i>
<i>But l kn</i>o<i>w n</i>o<i>w she exists.</i>

937
01:22:20,350 --> 01:22:25,583
<i>ls she chaste?</i>
<i>Or d</i>o<i>es she live fast and free?</i>

938
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:30,699
<i>Her virtue means n</i>o<i>thing</i>
<i>Because l am an artist,</i>

939
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:37,344
<i>And L</i>o<i>ve is the s</i>o<i>le auth</i>o<i>rity.</i>

940
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:42,025
So you´re disappointed and in Iove?

941
01:22:42,670 --> 01:22:45,946
Not disappointed,
but wise and in Iove.

942
01:22:46,110 --> 01:22:49,580
For aII that,
wiII you stay in Rochefort?

943
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:51,900
I can´t. I pIay in Paris tomorrow.

944
01:22:52,070 --> 01:22:54,345
But I´II be back next week.

945
01:22:54,830 --> 01:22:57,628
I must find that girI.

946
01:22:58,190 --> 01:22:59,908
Maybe you know her?

947
01:23:00,070 --> 01:23:02,379
There are many pretty girIs here.

948
01:23:03,950 --> 01:23:05,861
So you wrote to me?

949
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:09,268
Yes, about a young friend...

950
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:14,220
an admirer who´d Iike to meet you.
She writes music...

951
01:23:14,470 --> 01:23:17,860
I´II say no more. But you can
heIp her. She deserves it.

952
01:23:18,030 --> 01:23:20,146
- Are you in Iove?
- Maybe.

953
01:23:20,390 --> 01:23:21,664
- Pretty?
- Much more.

954
01:23:22,110 --> 01:23:23,384
Wow!

955
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:26,979
I´m so thriIIed to see you.

956
01:23:27,150 --> 01:23:30,620
Listen to this.
TeII me what you think.

957
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:14,468
I´ve heard that somewhere.

958
01:24:16,230 --> 01:24:17,663
Nice, isn´t it?

959
01:24:18,310 --> 01:24:19,459
Very.

960
01:24:25,150 --> 01:24:27,345
I´ve heard it before.

961
01:24:28,590 --> 01:24:30,148
But where?

962
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:45,706
Odd! Where is my concerto?

963
01:24:45,870 --> 01:24:48,065
You had it today,
indeed a whiIe ago.

964
01:24:48,230 --> 01:24:50,585
But I put it in the usuaI pIace,

965
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:52,706
between my Iipstick
and eyegIass case.

966
01:24:56,870 --> 01:25:01,261
Here comes SubtiI Dutrouz.
You´ve aII met. Have a seat, do.

967
01:25:05,790 --> 01:25:10,261
- I don´t beIieve I know these girIs.
- I spoke of them.

968
01:25:10,790 --> 01:25:12,018
They´re my twin pearIs.

969
01:25:12,350 --> 01:25:14,545
I beIieve we´ve met somepIace.

970
01:25:14,790 --> 01:25:16,667
No, I never forget a face.

971
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:19,828
Upon my word,
I´ve seen you somewhere

972
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:22,902
unIess there´s a doubIe of you
out there.

973
01:25:23,870 --> 01:25:26,589
- DeIphine is a dancer...
- DoubtIess, I´m wrong...

974
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:30,823
SoIange is weII versed in music
and song. You´re just in time.

975
01:25:31,150 --> 01:25:32,549
But before you partake,

976
01:25:32,950 --> 01:25:35,259
do us the honors
and cut the cake.

977
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:37,506
I wouIdn´t know how.

978
01:25:37,710 --> 01:25:39,029
Are you being modest?

979
01:25:39,470 --> 01:25:41,938
I shan´t decIine if you insist.

980
01:25:42,150 --> 01:25:43,947
PIease do, Dutrouz.

981
01:25:48,070 --> 01:25:49,708
Maxence isn´t here, aIas.

982
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:51,940
He went home on a week-end pass.

983
01:25:52,110 --> 01:25:55,819
He caIIed his Ieave ´´immi-Nantes.´´
I had a good Iaugh.

984
01:25:56,030 --> 01:25:59,102
- The pun´s ineIegant.
- Who´s this joker?

985
01:25:59,350 --> 01:26:03,548
A painter-poet.
A saiIor who can do a portrait.

986
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:05,668
Does he Iove me?

987
01:26:05,830 --> 01:26:08,708
It´s anyone´s guess.

988
01:26:09,190 --> 01:26:11,420
I drink to your Iove and success.

989
01:26:11,630 --> 01:26:16,784
To oId times, so exotic! SaIonica!
We met there, in aeronautics.

990
01:26:17,110 --> 01:26:20,261
We met in Cherbourg,
in front of a bar.

991
01:26:20,430 --> 01:26:23,263
He´d been thrown out,
drunk as a tar.

992
01:26:23,430 --> 01:26:28,550
At the time, Iife was no joke.
I´d Iost my job and was fIat-broke.

993
01:26:28,790 --> 01:26:29,620
I got drunk.

994
01:26:30,030 --> 01:26:32,225
- What a downer!
- Don´t be a snot!

995
01:26:32,390 --> 01:26:34,540
- Don´t scratch.
- So what?

996
01:26:34,710 --> 01:26:38,339
Hands on the tabIe!
Enough champagne! He´s unbearabIe!

997
01:26:40,830 --> 01:26:42,980
I´m sure we´ve met
somewhere before.

998
01:26:43,150 --> 01:26:45,186
We haven´t, don´t insist anymore.

999
01:26:46,110 --> 01:26:48,908
Let the gentIeman finish his story.

1000
01:26:49,310 --> 01:26:50,868
Things weren´t hunky-dory.

1001
01:26:51,030 --> 01:26:53,339
I roamed through Cherbourg
aimIessIy

1002
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:55,978
after spending six months at sea.

1003
01:26:56,190 --> 01:27:00,069
I knew a hairdresser in Cherbourg,
Aimé...

1004
01:27:00,230 --> 01:27:02,186
He married
a certain Mme Desnoyers.

1005
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:05,547
A widow from Tours,
or was it OrIeans?

1006
01:27:05,870 --> 01:27:09,340
She was a mother,
a one-time chorine.

1007
01:27:09,790 --> 01:27:10,939
I don´t know her.

1008
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:14,627
No, it was Nantes, it seems.

1009
01:27:15,030 --> 01:27:18,261
- Is there any ice cream?
- Be quiet!

1010
01:27:19,470 --> 01:27:21,028
The dinner´s a bit duII.

1011
01:27:22,910 --> 01:27:26,539
How about a spectacIe?
Do a number from your show.

1012
01:27:26,710 --> 01:27:31,067
- Without a piano, no.
- I´m feeIing a bit out of tune.

1013
01:27:31,230 --> 01:27:33,903
- I haven´t seen your stage costume.
- Tomorrow.

1014
01:27:34,150 --> 01:27:39,429
But I won´t be at the fair.
I´m open on Sundays. I´m stuck here.

1015
01:27:40,350 --> 01:27:41,578
Leaving, then?

1016
01:27:41,910 --> 01:27:44,549
AIas, aII good things
come to an end.

1017
01:27:45,790 --> 01:27:48,623
We´re off as weII, we start at dawn.

1018
01:27:48,790 --> 01:27:51,543
Don´t get up,
we´re going, we´re gone.

1019
01:27:58,630 --> 01:28:01,269
Booboo´s sIeeping
the sIeep of the just.

1020
01:28:01,430 --> 01:28:04,024
With the bottIe he drank, he must!

1021
01:28:04,430 --> 01:28:06,898
The sandman´s gone a bit insane.

1022
01:28:07,070 --> 01:28:09,379
He sprinkIed Booboo
with champagne.

1023
01:28:14,230 --> 01:28:15,902
Good night, dears.

1024
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:24,459
How do I get this one up the stairs?

1025
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:42,984
SUNDAY

1026
01:32:34,830 --> 01:32:38,140
Ride, ride, ride!

1027
01:32:38,310 --> 01:32:41,347
Ride on air...No stress, no cares.

1028
01:32:41,510 --> 01:32:44,070
For aII tastes. At aII prices.

1029
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:05,069
- I messed up my eyes!
- They´re fine.

1030
01:33:05,230 --> 01:33:07,266
Have you seen my gIove?

1031
01:33:08,190 --> 01:33:09,305
You´re on!

1032
01:33:09,470 --> 01:33:12,780
I can´t go on with one...
Here it is!

1033
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:14,383
Hurry up!

1034
01:33:19,230 --> 01:33:24,588
And now, it´s our pIeasure
to present the Garnier sisters!

1035
01:33:26,510 --> 01:33:29,547
Here they are,
the famous Garnier sisters!

1036
01:33:37,830 --> 01:33:43,541
<i>When the summer is g</i>o<i>ne,</i>
<i>When the seas</i>o<i>ns m</i>o<i>ve</i> o<i>n,</i>

01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:49,620

1054
01:36:53,190 --> 01:36:56,341
- TaIk about stage fright!
- It went aII right.

1055
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:59,024
It came undone here.

1056
01:36:59,190 --> 01:37:00,908
- A guy to see you.
- Me?

1057
01:37:01,070 --> 01:37:02,947
- No, DeIphine.
- Who is it?

1058
01:37:03,110 --> 01:37:04,179
He didn´t say.

1059
01:37:04,510 --> 01:37:06,626
WeII, we got appIause.

1060
01:37:06,790 --> 01:37:09,702
Not quite the Asian shimmy,
but it´s got charm.

1061
01:37:09,870 --> 01:37:11,064
Enough out of you!

1062
01:37:11,230 --> 01:37:13,983
Go find your shimmiers, you boors!

1063
01:37:15,950 --> 01:37:16,826
Oh, it´s you.

1064
01:37:17,150 --> 01:37:18,139
Disappointed?

1065
01:37:21,630 --> 01:37:22,779
Yes.

1066
01:37:23,110 --> 01:37:26,864
I saw your act...
I came to say you´ve made progress.

1067
01:37:27,230 --> 01:37:28,822
Apart from the fIattery...?

1068
01:37:29,270 --> 01:37:32,740
If you wanted,
I couId make you a star.

1069
01:37:34,910 --> 01:37:36,104
Come with me,

1070
01:37:36,790 --> 01:37:38,621
I´m going to Paris.

1071
01:37:38,790 --> 01:37:41,588
- A girI Iike you...
- ...needs a man Iike you.

1072
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:44,662
I Iove how you think on your feet.

1073
01:37:44,830 --> 01:37:46,821
I never want to see you again.

1074
01:37:46,990 --> 01:37:48,343
You´II regret it.

1075
01:37:53,390 --> 01:37:55,187
What about my painter?

1076
01:37:55,950 --> 01:37:59,147
Transferred to Germany.
Thanks to me, dear heart.

1077
01:38:18,750 --> 01:38:21,059
DeIphine. My sister.

1078
01:38:22,990 --> 01:38:25,185
- It was wonderfuI.
- Thank you.

1079
01:38:25,350 --> 01:38:26,624
ReaIIy, I mean it.

1080
01:38:27,950 --> 01:38:28,939
Leaving tomorrow?

1081
01:38:29,110 --> 01:38:31,943
Yes. These gentIemen
wiII take us to Paris.

1082
01:38:36,030 --> 01:38:37,782
I saw my friend, Andy.

1083
01:38:38,110 --> 01:38:41,500
He came here to see me.
He´s going back to Paris.

1084
01:38:42,350 --> 01:38:46,025
He feII in Iove with a girI
he saw here.

1085
01:38:46,510 --> 01:38:49,582
It´s a Iong story.

1086
01:38:50,070 --> 01:38:52,948
I toId him about you.

1087
01:38:53,350 --> 01:38:55,102
You can go see him in Paris.

1088
01:38:55,270 --> 01:38:56,669
Thank you.

1089
01:38:57,470 --> 01:38:58,903
That was kind of you.

1090
01:38:59,550 --> 01:39:01,063
It´s onIy naturaI.

1091
01:39:02,750 --> 01:39:04,741
Good-bye, gentIemen.

1092
01:39:05,790 --> 01:39:07,781
- Bye, girIs.
- Bye, Mr. Dame.

1093
01:39:08,470 --> 01:39:09,619
Good Iuck.

1094
01:39:10,990 --> 01:39:13,379
- Don´t stay there.
- We in the way?

1095
01:39:13,550 --> 01:39:16,189
We´d Iike to change. Turn around.

1096
01:39:19,430 --> 01:39:21,898
- We´ve something to say.
- Make it quick.

1097
01:39:22,070 --> 01:39:23,469
Can we draw these?

1098
01:39:27,310 --> 01:39:28,538
We´re waiting.

1099
01:39:30,150 --> 01:39:33,222
Here goes:
Etienne and I Iove you.

1100
01:39:33,630 --> 01:39:36,098
But we Iove you, too. Don´t we?

1101
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:37,419
Sure, we do.

1102
01:39:37,750 --> 01:39:40,503
Can one of you pass me my jeans?

1103
01:39:43,110 --> 01:39:45,385
- We mean, romanticaIIy.
- What?

1104
01:39:45,550 --> 01:39:48,428
- We´re in Iove with you.
- What are they taIking about?

1105
01:39:48,590 --> 01:39:50,865
So, we want to sIeep with you.

1106
01:39:51,070 --> 01:39:51,980
What?

1107
01:39:52,910 --> 01:39:55,219
It´s normaI, when you´re in Iove.

1108
01:39:55,590 --> 01:39:58,787
- That expIains the Iift?
- We´II take the train.

1109
01:40:00,150 --> 01:40:02,710
You´re not very accommodating.

1110
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:05,547
We know your type.

1111
01:40:05,710 --> 01:40:10,545
<i>Always the same</i> o<i>ld tune,</i>

1116
01:40:30,710 --> 01:40:34,146

1118
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:39,065

- If you promise to behave.

1133
01:41:39,350 --> 01:41:42,865
- We´II try.
- Then we´re coming.

1134
01:41:43,150 --> 01:41:46,267

- See you tomorrow!

<i>Why?</i>

1141
01:43:02,710 --> 01:43:06,908
MONDAY MORNING

1142
01:43:08,830 --> 01:43:10,024
MaiIman!

1143
01:43:11,950 --> 01:43:14,225
Hurry, you´II be Iate.

1144
01:43:15,550 --> 01:43:17,108
Hurry, Booboo.

1145
01:43:20,150 --> 01:43:21,902
- ´Bye, sweetie.
- ´Bye, Mom.

1146
01:43:30,470 --> 01:43:32,586
- A cup of coffee.
- Make it two.

1147
01:43:33,390 --> 01:43:35,620
- Leaving aIready?
- We´II be back.

1148
01:43:35,790 --> 01:43:37,985
- Taking my girIs?
- We meet at noon.

1149
01:43:38,150 --> 01:43:39,549
Be carefuI.

1150
01:43:40,150 --> 01:43:42,710
- Was the fair a success?
- A huge one.

1151
01:43:42,870 --> 01:43:45,100
- And my girIs?
- A triumph!

1152
01:43:48,710 --> 01:43:51,349
They made the front page!
With a photo!

1153
01:43:51,990 --> 01:43:54,106
´´Twins Iaunch their own Gemini.´´

1154
01:43:55,510 --> 01:43:57,068
What´s that mean?

1155
01:44:01,830 --> 01:44:04,298
- I don´t get it.
- Me, neither.

1156
01:44:05,070 --> 01:44:06,549
Look, it´s Dutrouz!

1157
01:44:06,990 --> 01:44:09,743
´´Sadist Hid Murder Weapon at Home.´´

1158
01:44:13,270 --> 01:44:15,022
That´s Dutrouz, aII right.

1159
01:44:16,190 --> 01:44:18,988
They forgot the ´´z.´´
He´II Iose his head.

1160
01:44:19,150 --> 01:44:21,266
If he hoIds on to it.

1161
01:44:22,150 --> 01:44:23,947
How about that!

1162
01:44:24,110 --> 01:44:25,668
- ShaII we?
- Let´s go.

1163
01:44:25,830 --> 01:44:29,869
We have to go by the hoteI,
then finish Ioading.

1164
01:44:32,190 --> 01:44:34,260
That fuss about cutting a cake!

1165
01:44:34,430 --> 01:44:35,658
Wicked man!

1166
01:44:39,190 --> 01:44:41,306
Good-bye, and bon voyage.

1167
01:44:41,790 --> 01:44:44,463
If you´re ever in Rochefort,
stop by.

1168
01:44:52,350 --> 01:44:54,500
True, there´s troubIe everywhere.

1169
01:44:55,990 --> 01:44:57,469
Dutrouz...

1170
01:44:58,270 --> 01:44:59,828
The rat!

1171
01:45:05,390 --> 01:45:07,301
11:30 aIready...

1172
01:45:13,470 --> 01:45:17,065
- I´ve come for my Iesson.
- SchooI´s cIosed for good.

1173
01:45:18,910 --> 01:45:22,027
- Who was it?
- The Dumont girI, for her Iesson.

1174
01:45:22,190 --> 01:45:23,589
At this hour!

1175
01:45:23,750 --> 01:45:25,069
It´s 11:30.

1176
01:45:25,230 --> 01:45:28,108
I didn´t canceI!
We´II never make it by noon!

1177
01:45:28,270 --> 01:45:31,342
We must say good-bye to Mom
and fetch Booboo.

1178
01:45:31,830 --> 01:45:34,025
How wiII I manage in time?

1179
01:45:34,870 --> 01:45:37,828
I´II kiss Mom good-bye
whiIe you go by schooI.

1180
01:45:40,110 --> 01:45:43,625
- What´d you Iose?
- The 3rd movement of my concerto.

1181
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:47,700
- This is a disaster!
- You know it by heart.

1182
01:45:48,230 --> 01:45:49,743
StiII, it´s annoying.

1183
01:45:58,510 --> 01:46:01,422
- What if they reaIIy Iove us?
- Who?

1184
01:46:02,750 --> 01:46:03,785
Our carnies.

1185
01:46:04,710 --> 01:46:05,825
I don´t know.

1186
01:46:14,230 --> 01:46:17,586
- They´re sweet.
- Yes, they are.

1187
01:46:18,470 --> 01:46:20,142
What about your foreigner?

1188
01:46:20,310 --> 01:46:22,824
Vanished. Maybe I dreamed him up.

1189
01:46:23,030 --> 01:46:25,749
- And your painter?
- He´s in Germany.

1190
01:46:27,590 --> 01:46:31,583
- Expecting someone?
- No, but now we´re reaIIy Iate.

1191
01:46:34,350 --> 01:46:37,228
SoIange, you must come right away.

1192
01:46:37,390 --> 01:46:38,459
Where?

1193
01:46:38,630 --> 01:46:41,269
To my shop. Andy´s back
and waiting for you.

1194
01:46:41,430 --> 01:46:42,419
Now?

1195
01:46:42,590 --> 01:46:44,899
Right now.
He´s just passing through.

1196
01:46:45,070 --> 01:46:49,507
But we´re so Iate aIready, and
I must fetch my brother at schooI.

1197
01:46:51,270 --> 01:46:53,864
Maybe he couId go.
The schooI´s right nearby.

1198
01:46:54,030 --> 01:46:55,941
- It´d heIp us out.
- How can you?

1199
01:46:56,110 --> 01:46:57,463
Of course I wiII!

1200
01:46:57,830 --> 01:47:00,902
Ask for Booboo.
He´s a IittIe redhead.

1201
01:47:02,710 --> 01:47:05,065
ImpossibIe, I can´t go!

1202
01:47:05,230 --> 01:47:07,141
I´m scared stiff!
I´II see him in Paris.

1203
01:47:07,310 --> 01:47:09,346
Nonsense! Go on!

1204
01:47:09,510 --> 01:47:11,546
- Yes, go on!
- I´m shaking!

1205
01:47:11,950 --> 01:47:13,224
It´s so crazy!

1206
01:47:58,550 --> 01:48:00,108
Not even a ´´heIIo´´?

1207
01:48:03,230 --> 01:48:05,903
What a difference!
I mean, from the uniform.

1208
01:48:06,070 --> 01:48:07,662
I´m out, Yvonne!

1209
01:48:09,310 --> 01:48:10,220
Time to Iive!

1210
01:48:10,390 --> 01:48:13,302
I thought they´d keep you...
seeing the news.

1211
01:48:13,470 --> 01:48:16,428
- What news?
- Seen the papers? TroubIe aII over.

1212
01:48:16,750 --> 01:48:20,538
Come on! Dutrouz may be
a pessimist, but you?

1213
01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:23,020
Speak of the deviI...

1214
01:48:23,230 --> 01:48:25,061
Look at this.

1215
01:48:26,350 --> 01:48:28,910
He´s the sadist!
A crime of passion...

1216
01:48:29,630 --> 01:48:31,985
For 40 years, she turned him down.

1217
01:48:32,750 --> 01:48:36,982
Sure, it was aggravating, but
that´s no reason to carve her up.

1218
01:48:37,390 --> 01:48:39,858
She was too big a thing in his Iife.

1219
01:48:42,590 --> 01:48:44,387
I´m off.

1220
01:48:44,710 --> 01:48:45,859
To Paris?

1221
01:48:47,430 --> 01:48:50,024
You may run into my daughters.

1222
01:48:50,190 --> 01:48:53,227
I met one the other day... SoIange.

1223
01:48:53,430 --> 01:48:54,624
And your ideaI?

1224
01:48:55,750 --> 01:48:57,308
It´II have to wait.

1225
01:48:57,470 --> 01:49:00,587
My picture´s at the gaIIery.
Go see it sometime.

1226
01:49:01,190 --> 01:49:03,750
Let me kiss you good-bye.

1227
01:49:04,990 --> 01:49:06,708
Good-bye, Maxence.

1228
01:49:25,150 --> 01:49:27,505
- So you´re reaIIy off?
- About time!

1229
01:49:28,910 --> 01:49:32,186
- SoIange won´t come by?
- I came for both of us.

1230
01:49:33,470 --> 01:49:35,426
I guess you can´t fetch Booboo.

1231
01:49:35,790 --> 01:49:36,905
He´s in good hands.

1232
01:49:37,070 --> 01:49:40,380
A friend, Mr Dame, went for him.
Lucky he came by.

1233
01:49:41,870 --> 01:49:44,179
What´d you say? Mr Dame?

1234
01:49:44,630 --> 01:49:47,349
Simon Dame.
A siIIy name, but a nice man.

1235
01:49:48,350 --> 01:49:50,341
I must go out.

1236
01:49:50,590 --> 01:49:53,821
Gramps is asIeep, Josette
isn´t back. Watch the pIace!

1237
01:49:53,990 --> 01:49:57,380
But I can´t! They´re waiting for me.

1238
01:50:03,790 --> 01:50:05,143
Be right back.

1239
01:50:07,990 --> 01:50:10,504
Yvonne! My paper!

1240
01:50:11,350 --> 01:50:12,749
You hear me?

1241
01:50:20,430 --> 01:50:22,261
I forgot my bag.

1242
01:50:25,150 --> 01:50:26,663
Who´s there?

1243
01:51:02,230 --> 01:51:03,504
The foreigner...

1244
01:51:05,350 --> 01:51:07,910
- Are you Andy?
- That´s me.

1245
01:51:08,710 --> 01:51:11,986
- Where´d you find that music?
- In the street.

1246
01:51:12,350 --> 01:51:13,749
I Iooked aII over.

1247
01:51:13,910 --> 01:51:16,822
So did I. I Iooked aII over for you.

1248
01:53:13,870 --> 01:53:15,428
Yvonne! You here?
