1
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,600
Now then, let me see.

2
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,400
Mr. Martin, is everyone here?

3
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,600
I believe so.

4
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,000
- Well, don't believe, be sure.
- Yes, sir.

5
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,200
- Bellboys?
- Here.

6
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,300
- Chefs?
- Here.

7
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,500
- Chambermaids?
- Here.

8
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,700
- Elevator boys?
- Here.

9
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
- Porters?
- Here.

10
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,300
- Floor managers?
- Here.

11
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,400
- Bartenders?
- Here.

12
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,100
- Telephone operators?
- Here.

13
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,700
Yes, sir, the entire staff is assembled.

14
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,100
Ladies and gentlemen,
as such I address you...

15
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,100
as the employees of this great hotel.

16
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,200
Our brief summer season
will start tomorrow.

17
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,400
You are here
to serve the most exacting clientele...

18
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,800
of any hotel in America.

19
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,200
In the world.

20
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,900
The Wentworth Plaza, as you know...

21
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,500
caters only to the most exclusive
and the wealthiest guests.

22
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,000
You are the temporary servants...

23
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,500
of those who demand
the most of their servants...

24
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
and yet...

25
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,500
some of you receive no salaries.

26
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,400
That is because
I could never begin to pay you...

27
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,700
what you will earn in honorariums.

28
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,200
I mean tips.

29
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,500
Some managers,
knowing the size of these tips...

30
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,000
would require you to pay
for your positions.

31
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,800
But I...

32
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,400
I like to see each and every one of you
derive the full benefit...

33
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,200
of your enterprise.

34
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,700
Now, remember our credo:

35
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,400
The guest is always right.

36
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,800
Keep that firmly in your minds.

37
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,900
Even though he's wrong,
the guest is always right.

38
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,200
Because he pays.

39
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,100
That will be all, thank you.

40
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,500
Remember, guys,
whatever the guests give you, I get 50%.

41
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,900
And if you hold out on me,
I'll take the whole works...

42
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and no crap games
unless I'm in it myself, because...

43
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,200
Last year, one of my waiters
received such big fees...

44
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,400
he now operates a hotel of his own.

45
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,100
But remember, I get my percentage...

46
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,100
and also remember...

47
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,700
You come in direct contact
with the guests.

48
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,000
I do not.

49
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,200
Therefore, I expect a certain payment
from you...

50
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,400
in return for your
remunerative privileges...

51
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,300
and don't forget...

52
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,100
All tips go in here...

53
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,900
and remember,
I have eyes in the back of my head.

54
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,300
I have the key.

55
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,100
The tips are split even...

56
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,400
except in special cases
when I take two-thirds.

57
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,400
I suppose if a guest insults me
he's considered right.

58
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,800
My dear, you've been with me
two seasons.

59
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,600
That's long enough to know that
a hotel hostess cannot be insulted.

60
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,800
I rely on your splendid discretion,
as always.

61
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,800
I sometimes wonder if my discretion
can hold up under the wear and tear.

62
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,500
Curtis, it's good to have you with us again.

63
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,700
Thanks, Mr. Lamson.

64
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,500
Oh, Martin, did you get
that Prentiss reservation?

65
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,500
- Yes, this morning, sir.
- Fine!

66
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,500
How are the studies?

67
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,000
Still at medical school?

68
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,400
Yes, sir, I expect to have
my degree in about another year.

69
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,800
That's too bad for me.

70
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,000
The medical profession may gain,
but I lose an A-number-one hotel clerk.

71
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,800
Oh, you're very kind, sir.

72
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,800
And I suppose when it's Dr. Curtis,
I shall be losing you, too?

73
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,200
Well...

74
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,400
Yes, sir. You see,
being Mrs. Curtis is really a full-time job.

75
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,500
Well...

76
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,100
congratulations.

77
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,000
Name the first one after me.

78
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,900
Paging Mr. Baker. Mr. Baker, please.

79
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,400
Paging Mr. Baker.

80
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
Boy.

81
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,200
Well, here we are. Come on, Mama.

82
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Come on, Ann. Hurry up, now.

83
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,800
Wait a minute. I forgot my purse.

84
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,300
That's the Prentiss family.
The old gal's worth $10 million.

85
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,900
Just to show you my heart's in the right
place, I'll let you keep all she gives you.

86
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,500
- Gee! Thanks, boss.
- Wow!

87
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,400
- How do you do, Mrs. Prentiss?
- Oh, how do you do?

88
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,900
It's a pleasure to welcome you. I never
think our season is complete without you.

89
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,900
- Have you reserved the same suite for us?
- Of course.

90
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,800
Not at the same outrageous price, I trust?

91
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,000
The price is quite fair.

92
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,000
You people seem to think
that money grows on trees.

93
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,600
Yes, madam, that is...

94
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,600
we'll discuss it some other time.
I know you want to rest now.

95
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,000
- Rest? I can't rest at those prices.
- How do you do, Mrs. Prentiss?

96
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,600
- Oh, how do you do, young man?
- Nicely, thank you.

97
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,500
- And how are you, Miss Prentiss?
- So happy I can hardly stand it.

98
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,700
Well.

99
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,800
I know you.
You're the hostess, aren't you?

100
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,000
- I remember you from last summer.
- Do you?

101
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,200
I certainly do.

102
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,100
Humbolt!

103
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,200
The bell ending the first round.

104
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,600
I'll see you later.
We'll fight this out to a finish.

105
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,400
Humbolt, where are you?

106
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,400
You see, Mother...

107
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,800
last season that little lady told me
she couldn't swim...

108
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,700
- and I was just going to teach her when...
- When I took you home.

109
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,900
- I always know what I'm doing.
- Yes, Mother.

110
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,200
Yes, those two go in that room,
and those three in that room, yes...

111
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,300
and yes, those go in that room.

112
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,600
How many gallons of gas
did we use coming up, Humbolt?

113
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,200
- Twenty.
- Twenty!

114
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,700
- Is there anything else?
- Oh, yes, yes. If you'll just take this...

115
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,600
and have it changed,
and divide it amongst you.

116
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,500
I've got to hand it to you, Mother.

117
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,800
It takes a lot of nerve
to give four boys a quarter...

118
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,200
for carrying up 16 pieces of baggage.

119
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,300
How many times have I told you?

120
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,200
Just because I happen to be rich, I have
no intention of being imposed upon.

121
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,100
A dollar wouldn't have been any too much.

122
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,700
What? 75 cents more?

123
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,300
Have you any idea
of what the interest on 75 cents is...

124
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,600
- at 3.5%? Have you?
- No, Mother, I haven't.

125
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,500
Well, you just take this pad and pencil
and sit right down there and figure it out.

126
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,500
You know that I'm not good at fractions.

127
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
No, but I notice you're very good
at figures.

128
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,700
Yes, you might say that I'm a specialist.

129
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,800
Humbolt, how can you joke
about a thing like that?

130
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,000
- I joke about it because I enjoy it.
- Well, I don't enjoy it!

131
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,200
When I think of the grief you've caused me
with your three marriages...

132
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,700
- Four, Mother, four.
- Four!

133
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,600
To think of four horrible chorus girls
running around...

134
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,600
with the honorable name of Prentiss!

135
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,200
We must keep the name going.

136
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,500
And to think that I had to settle $100,000
on each one of them!

137
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,500
Now what's a paltry $400,000
between friends?

138
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
Oh!

139
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,400
Do you know the interest on that at 4.5%...

140
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,700
you bad, wicked boy? Do you?

141
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,500
No, of course, you don't.
Well, I'll show you!

142
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,000
$400,000...

143
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,600
- 4.5%.
- Mother!

144
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,400
Don't bother Mother, darling,
while she's figuring interest.

145
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,900
Mother, I want some decent clothes.

146
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,300
- You want what?
- Some decent clothes.

147
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:24,400
Well, look at me. Is it any wonder that
nobody ever talks to me or notices me?

148
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,400
Well, who do you want to notice you?

149
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,000
Men and boys. I want to have some fun.

150
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,600
- She's right, Mother.
- Humbolt, you've done enough damage.

151
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,800
Ann, I can't imagine you even thinking
of other men when you're engaged.

152
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,100
Engaged to T. Mosley Thorpe,
the most eligible bachelor in America.

153
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,800
Eligible for what?

154
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,800
Oh, my dear child, you must be crazy.

155
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,600
Why, he has $5 million more than we have.

156
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,800
I'll give you my interest in him
for 10 cents.

157
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,000
That will do, Ann.

158
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,200
Come on, Ma. Break down
and buy her some snappy clothes.

159
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,300
Please, Mother.

160
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,900
Go to bed, both of you,
and stop bothering me.

161
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,800
I'd give a $100
if you children would behave.

162
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,000
- $100?
- Well, $35.

163
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,300
How do you do, Westbrook?

164
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,200
- How do you do, McManus?
- And how is Mr. Thorpe?

165
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,200
- Mr. Thorpe was never better.
- I certainly am delighted to hear that.

166
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,400
- Boy, get Mr. Thorpe's luggage.
- Yes, sir.

167
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,300
Welcome to the hotel, Mr. Thorpe.

168
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,700
Westbrook, where is Mr. Thorpe?

169
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,400
I say, Mr. Thorpe is not in the car.

170
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,700
- Where is he?
- That's what I'm asking you, Westbrook.

171
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,700
He must have missed me.

172
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,500
Oh, here's Mr. Thorpe now.

173
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,600
How do you do, sir?

174
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,300
Say, what happened to me?

175
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,900
You must have got out
when we stopped to get gas, sir.

176
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You never stop the car while I'm in it.

177
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,100
- Let that be a lesson to you.
- Yes, sir.

178
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,500
- Did I discharge you last night?
- Not to my recollection, sir.

179
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,800
Oh, excuse me.

180
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,100
Hello.

181
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,700
Oh, you bad boy.

182
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,300
How do you do, Mr. Thorpe?

183
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,900
- How do you do?
- Your rooms are all ready for you, sir.

184
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,800
That's fine. And my boxes, did they arrive?

185
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,100
- We put them in your room, sir.
- Oh, and I want a stenographer.

186
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,200
I'm writing a monograph on snuff boxes.

187
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,300
Very important dictation.

188
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,400
I'll send one up
in just a few minutes, Mr. Thorpe.

189
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,800
Yes, a stenographer
and a cheese sandwich on rye.

190
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,000
If you will kindly follow me, sir.

191
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,900
What'll it be, sir?

192
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,800
- I'll have a room and a bath.
- This is the cigar counter, sir.

193
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,900
I'm sorry.

194
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,100
That's all right, miss. Don't apologize.
Anyone's liable to make a mistake.

195
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,300
- Mr. Thorpe, the elevators are this way.
- What are they doing over there?

196
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,900
This way, Mr. Thorpe.

197
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,100
Fine, put them up here.

198
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,100
- Can I help you, sir?
- No, no, I'll take care of these.

199
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,400
Aren't they beautiful?

200
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,400
- Well, what are they?
- Snuff boxes.

201
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,100
- What?
- Snuff. Snuff.

202
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,300
Snuff was first used in the 17th century.
In the 18th century, it was universal.

203
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,400
It's a mild stimulant
and an excellent germicide.

204
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,000
It's been known to kill thousands
and thousands of germs.

205
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,800
- Yes, sir.
- Yes. Try some.

206
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,200
- Oh, no, thanks.
- Oh, go on. It's better than a tonic.

207
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,800
Where will I put it?

208
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,700
Well, you can put it...
I would suggest putting it in your nose.

209
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,000
Just an amateur, just an amateur.

210
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
See, it's almost a lost art.
Now, it requires years of great skill.

211
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,400
Now, you watch me.

212
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,200
Watch me, please.

213
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,900
It's like...

214
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,400
It requires...

215
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,900
I won't need you anymore.

216
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,000
Pardon me.

217
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,800
But why can't I go on the beach
with Humbolt?

218
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,800
You shall go on the beach, but not
with Humbolt. Mosley will go with you.

219
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,500
Some fun!

220
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,400
Now, don't forget, Ann. I want you to be
very warm and affectionate to Mosley.

221
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,900
Don't disturb me. I'm working.

222
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,800
Oh, Mosley, dear, so nice to see you back.

223
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,500
We could hardly wait till you got here,
could we, Ann, dear?

224
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,100
- No, we could hardly wait.
- Oh, hello. I've been working on my book.

225
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,000
- Oh, Mosley, haven't you made a mistake?
- A mistake?

226
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,700
Yes, well, you kissed me
and shook hands with Ann instead of...

227
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,100
I was thinking of my book.
But I have a present here for Ann.

228
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,500
Oh, a present. Aren't you kind, Mosley?
Isn't Mosley kind, darling?

229
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,200
Yes, Mother.
His kindness positively bowls me over.

230
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,100
The gold and silver snuff box
continues to be...

231
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,200
the typical gift of sovereigns
to those whom they delight to honor.

232
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,700
- Oh, isn't it lovely, darling?
- Too sweet for words.

233
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,400
It embraces the art and craft
of the gold- and the silversmith.

234
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,800
Do you think you could tear yourself away
from your work long enough take a swim?

235
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,200
No. I must finish my monograph
by the end of the summer.

236
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,900
- But, Mosley, we thought that maybe you...
- No, I'll work till my brain gets fogged...

237
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,100
then I'll join you later.

238
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,300
- But think, maybe just...
- Mother, I'm going for a swim.

239
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,600
- Mosley, dear... Just a second, darling.
- I must work.

240
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,100
- Oh, is this Mr. Mosley Thorpe's room?
- Yes. Yes.

241
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,300
Thank you.

242
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,400
I beg your pardon.
Did you send for a stenographer?

243
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,600
Yes, and a Swiss cheese on rye.
Have you got it with you?

244
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,600
- No.
- That's strange. Sit down.

245
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,400
Thank you.

246
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,100
Do you know anything about snuff boxes?

247
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,400
No, not very much.

248
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,700
Well, you will
before I get through with you.

249
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,000
Shall we begin now?

250
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,600
Oh, yes. Every moment is precious.
Will you have a pinch of snuff?

251
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,300
No, but I'd just as soon join you
in a chew of tobacco.

252
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,100
Oh, Mosley. Ann, here's Mosley.

253
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,400
Am I thrilled.

254
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,700
I came to a stopping place.
My brain got fogged.

255
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,000
I thought I'd come and look you up.

256
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,700
- Well, I'm glad you did. Very glad you did.
- Thank you.

257
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,400
I'll leave you two little lovebirds alone.

258
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,500
Well, bye-bye.

259
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,900
Bye-bye.

260
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,000
- Nice weather we're having.
- Yes, yes indeed.

261
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,700
- Not so hot as last year.
- You don't say.

262
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,800
No.

263
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,300
Are you enjoying yourself this summer?

264
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,500
Oh, I'm just dizzy with all the excitement.

265
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,200
Oh, don't overdo it. Don't overdo it.

266
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,600
- Well, I'll try not to if you say so.
- No.

267
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,900
You know,
when my monograph is published...

268
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,200
it will occupy three 600-page volumes.

269
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,600
It will establish me as the world's greatest
authority on snuff and snuff boxes.

270
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,400
- Do tell.
- Yes, it is rather breathtaking.

271
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,600
What's the matter, Ann?

272
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,500
- What's the matter, Ann?
- You, you're the matter!

273
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,200
Have I said anything to hurt your feelings?

274
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,100
You don't have to.
Just looking at you is enough!

275
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,400
You're not a man! You're a mummy!
A mummy filled with snuff!

276
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
Calm yourself, my child.

277
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,400
I won't calm myself and I'm not your child!
Take your hands off me.

278
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,400
Go on, get out.
Go back to your silly monograph!

279
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,800
- Go on! Go on and get out!
- What is the matter?

280
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,500
Why, this child must have eaten
something that disagreed with her.

281
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,900
Put her to bed with a hot water bottle.

282
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,700
That'll be more fun than I've had in ages.

283
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,800
My mood for writing is completely gone.
My brain is more fogged than ever.

284
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,600
- You said it.
- I'm going out for a walk.

285
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,200
- Ann, what ails you?
- Mosley. I'm fed up to here with him.

286
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,200
Mosley is a man of honor.
He'll make you an admirable husband.

287
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,300
Maybe he will,
but if I'm going to be married to him...

288
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,600
I want to have a little fun first.

289
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,700
Don't you think
you're being unreasonable, Ann?

290
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,400
Not at all. Why can't I have a little fun
like other girls have?

291
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,700
Like you had?

292
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,200
Well, of course...

293
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,300
Of course, your father
was a bit different than Mosley.

294
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,200
- Of course he was. And so are we.
- Ann!

295
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,000
Oh, Mother, break down.
You know it's only fair.

296
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,100
If I let you have fun this summer...

297
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,200
will you promise to marry Mosley
in the fall without a protest?

298
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,800
Yes, I promise.

299
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,500
- Well, then...
- Mother, you're a darling!

300
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,800
And can I do anything I want to
when I want to do it...

301
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,900
as long as
I don't disgrace the family name?

302
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,900
All right, but I do think that
you should have a...

303
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,100
Oh, my goodness. See who it is, Ann, dear.

304
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,100
- Oh, good evening.
- Good evening.

305
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,600
Oh, good evening, young man.

306
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,000
Did you speak to the manager for me?

307
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,800
Yes, Mrs. Prentiss.
That's what I called about.

308
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,500
Mr. Lamson says that
he cannot reduce the rate of this suite...

309
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,600
and sends his regrets.

310
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,800
The criminal!

311
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,700
He's trying to put me in the poorhouse.
That's what he's trying to do.

312
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,400
And $15. $15 for dinner tonight.

313
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,000
It's nothing short of highway robbery.

314
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,700
It's a shame the way everyone tries
to take advantage of you.

315
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,200
Oh, you've noticed it, too?

316
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,800
Yes, Mrs. Prentiss.

317
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,200
Well, I'll show them.
I'll ban the hotel restaurant.

318
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,600
I'll cook all my meals up here
on my electric iron.

319
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,500
Why don't you try
Ye Olde Coffee Shoppe in the village?

320
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,400
They have an eight-course dinner there
for 65 cents.

321
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,000
- With dessert, too?
- With everything.

322
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,400
Well, that's much more like it.

323
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,600
Thank you,
thank you very much, young man.

324
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,000
Thank you. Good night.

325
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,600
- Good night.
- Just a moment.

326
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,900
You're an honest, serious,
intelligent young man, aren't you?

327
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,700
Well, Mrs. Prentiss, I do try
to be serious and, honest, yes.

328
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,000
Well, I've been keeping an eye on you,
and mind you...

329
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,100
mind you,
I'm a very good judge of human nature.

330
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,100
And I consider you entirely trustworthy.

331
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,000
You're very kind, Mrs. Prentiss.

332
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,400
Would you like to earn $500?

333
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,800
Of course! Who wouldn't?

334
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,100
Well, I'd like a trustworthy young man
to take my daughter to...

335
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,300
Please, Mother!

336
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,600
To teas and dances
and the social functions...

337
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,800
she may wish to attend
for the rest of the summer.

338
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,100
And I don't know of anyone whom
I'd rather trust her with than you.

339
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,200
Well, I'm sorry, but I don't go in for that.

340
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,600
I'm sure you can find
plenty others that will.

341
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,900
Probably I could, but not the type I want.

342
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,300
You see, I want someone
who'll consider this...

343
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,400
purely as a business proposition.

344
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,000
$500.

345
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,700
That would nearly pay my expenses
at medical school next year.

346
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,400
- Did I say $500?
- Yes, Mother, you did.

347
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,000
Well, I thought I said $450...

348
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,900
but, of course, if I said $500, $500 it is.

349
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,000
Well, I'm sorry, I can't do it.

350
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,300
If you're worried about
your professional standing...

351
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,600
we might say
that you're a distant relative.

352
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,100
- Could I let you know in the morning?
- Of course.

353
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,400
And I'm sure that you'll accept it
after you've slept on it.

354
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,500
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night.

355
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,600
Good night.

356
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,000
Mother, how could you?
I've never been so humiliated in all my life.

357
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,400
Well, my dear, you started this.

358
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,300
You said you want to have some fun
this summer.

359
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,600
All right, you can. But with protection.

360
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,300
In other words,
she wants to give me $500...

361
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,200
just to chaperone her silly daughter.

362
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,500
I'm not the type.

363
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,000
If you ask me,
I think it's a great opportunity.

364
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,200
- Are you kidding?
- Certainly not.

365
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,100
You want to get ahead, don't you?

366
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,500
Surely, but I don't want to be a nursemaid
to some insignificant chromo.

367
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,800
Ann Prentiss isn't so bad.
It's the way she dresses.

368
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,100
Besides, it means some ready cash.

369
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:43,200
And what's more, a valuable social contact
that never did any doctor a bit of harm.

370
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,300
I suppose not.

371
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,800
The more cash we put by,
the sooner we can get married.

372
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,900
Isn't that right?

373
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,400
I can't argue with you there, dear.

374
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,700
I think that's a very wise decision,
young man.

375
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,800
So do I.

376
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,700
Mr. Thorpe, are you sure
you have no objections?

377
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,800
Certainly not. I'll be able to finish
my monograph without any distractions.

378
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,000
- Many thanks.
- Now, about a schedule.

379
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,100
After luncheon, maybe a little walk,
and then a game of Ping-Pong.

380
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,200
Oh, no schedules, Mother.

381
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,000
I'm gonna do what I want
whenever I want to.

382
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,900
- Why, Ann!
- Well, that was the bargain.

383
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,400
And the first thing I'm going to do
is get some decent clothes.

384
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,500
I'm sick and tired
of looking like Little Orphan Annie.

385
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,100
What's the matter with your clothes?

386
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,100
- Your dresses are always trim and neat.
- Yes, like burlap bags.

387
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
- Come on, Mr. Curtis.
- Yes, with pleasure.

388
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:35,000
Now remember, young man,
$500 for the job, and no extras.

389
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,600
No extras. Not even a sales tax.

390
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,000
A- shopping we will go
A- shopping we will go

391
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,800
Heigh-ho the merry-o
To spend your mama's dough

392
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,500
- Well, I'll see you later.
- Oh, no, you got to go with me.

393
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,500
No, I've never been shopping
with a woman.

394
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,000
That makes it even, 'cause I've never been
shopping with a man.

395
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,500
- Come on.
- Now look, you don't understand.

396
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,100
I don't know anything about shopping.
I'm studying medicine.

397
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,100
Well, I'm telling you,
I won't be any use to you at all.

398
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,200
But at least you can help me decide
what's what.

399
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,700
Now look, wait a minute.
Now, if we were sweethearts...

400
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,000
But we're not.

401
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,700
I realize that, but I mean
if we were sweethearts...

402
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,500
I'd have the good right
to tell you what's what.

403
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,700
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

404
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,700
And then when you'd go shopping,
why, I'd go along and I'd even dare to...

405
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,300
Dare to what?

406
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,800
Well, I'd...

407
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,100
I'd dare to sing you this song

408
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,700
Whenever you go shopping
To buy a dress that's new

409
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,500
Honey, I'll keep my eye on
The dresses you try on

410
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,000
'Cause I'm going shopping with you

411
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:45,100
When you go to the jeweler
To buy a gem or two

412
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,500
On your fourth little finger
A ring's gonna linger

413
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,600
'Cause I'm going shopping with you

414
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:56,300
Lots of shoes and stockings
And plenty of new chapeaux

415
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,500
That's what I could go for

416
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,600
For the cute little baby
Inside those clothes

417
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,800
You go and pick the cottage
I'll put the mortgage through

418
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,200
Honey, I don't know whether
We'll move in together

419
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,000
But I'm going shopping with you
Where's your basket?

420
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,200
I'm going shopping with you

421
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,900
Let's go to the beauty parlor.

422
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,500
- But why?
- I need my face redone.

423
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,100
If they paint you, they're silly.
They can't paint a lily.

424
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,200
But we'll let them try it for fun

425
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,900
- We must go to the grocers.
- To the grocers?

426
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,100
I might need an egg or two.

427
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,300
Then I'll bring home the bacon,
or am I mistaken?

428
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,100
About going shopping with you?

429
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:44,100
We can build a nest with sweet kisses
And then someday

430
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,000
Maybe we'll be blessed with
In the pig Latin language

431
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,700
An aby-bay

432
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,300
I'll buy the baby blankets.

433
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,800
- What color?
- All trimmed in baby blue?

434
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,800
Okay.

435
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,800
Then I'll be right behind you
'Cause let me remind you

436
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,400
That I'm going shopping with you
In the basement

437
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,500
I'm going shopping with you

438
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,600
Well, here we are. Where do we go first?

439
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,300
There!

440
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,000
- Would you like these?
- Would you like to try them on?

441
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,100
- Would you like to take a walk?
- You step in, I'll step out.

442
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,800
- How do you like them?
- They're all right, but I like you better.

443
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,900
- How much are those mules?
- $22.

444
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I'll bet your mother would
get a kick out of them.

445
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,100
Joke. Yes.

446
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,200
Mademoiselle, that brings out
all the charm in your personality.

447
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,600
I hope I can do as well.

448
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,700
L 'Air Stade, mademoiselle.

449
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,000
We blend it especially for the blond type.

450
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,100
- Like it?
- Ought to be great with ginger ale.

451
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,400
A real bargain, miss, for only $12,000.

452
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,000
- I'll take it.
- Fine. Is there anything else?

453
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,000
Yes, some smelling salts for her old...
Her mother.

454
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,800
Hey, what is this? A shortwave set?

455
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,100
- No, permanent.
- Oh, yes.

456
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,300
Lots of shoes and stockings
And plenty of new chapeaux

457
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,700
That's what I could go for

458
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,700
For the cute little baby
Inside those clothes

459
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:24,200
Behold the finished product!
Behold a dream come true!

460
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:28,300
But I feel apprehensive
It might be expensive

461
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,900
To always go shopping with

462
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,400
That's Mother

463
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,300
Good evening.

464
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,700
Well?

465
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,100
I distinctly remember telling you
never to serve that man again.

466
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,600
I'm sorry, Mr. Lamson,
but he walked into the dining room...

467
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,400
Stupid! That's what you are, stupid.

468
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,600
For my horse.

469
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,700
Mr. Nicoleff, this must stop! I can't permit
you to charge any more meals.

470
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,900
- Either you pay when you are served...
- Silence!

471
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,700
- What?
- I said, silence!

472
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,900
No more silly chatter from you.

473
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,200
Nicoleff is not satisfied with the food.

474
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,600
Well, really?

475
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,100
Do you call this muck caviar? Taste it!

476
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,900
I order vintage champagne. What do I get?

477
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,000
Vinegar filled with gas. Taste it!

478
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,000
Am I or am I not paying
for first-class service?

479
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,400
That's just it, Mr. Nicoleff.

480
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,700
- You are not paying.
- And I am not getting service.

481
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,100
The orchestra. Why is it not playing?

482
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,600
How do you expect the soul of Nicoleff
to expand without music?

483
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,300
Now, let us discuss this matter calmly.

484
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,700
Nicoleff is always calm.
Calm, but indignant.

485
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:10,000
Why? Why do you write me such letters?
Why do you insult a man of my caliber?

486
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,800
That's no reason to be insulted
just because I ask you to pay...

487
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,000
a week in advance.

488
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,700
You, a common hotel manager, asks me...

489
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,400
Nicolai Nicoleff,
to pay a hotel bill in advance!

490
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,400
We are both men of the world. You know
I know you never paid a bill in your life.

491
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,900
I leave. I pack. Not one more minute
will I spend in this fourth-rate hotel!

492
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,300
If you'll just be calm, we might arrange
something about your bill.

493
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,400
What did you say about the bill?

494
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,400
I would like to remain.
This place is very good for my liver.

495
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,100
Mr. Nicoleff, you have a great reputation
as a theatrical producer.

496
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,300
I am the greatest theatrical producer
of the past 500 years.

497
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,600
Continue.

498
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,600
Mrs. Matilda Prentiss just arrived,
you know, the widow of H.P. Prentiss...

499
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,000
the flypaper king.

500
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,100
Blatantly, vulgarly rich.

501
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:59,500
Disgustingly rich, and she puts on
a musical show here every season.

502
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,900
A benefit for the milk fund.

503
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,500
I don't like milk.

504
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:07,600
It occurred to me that on my
recommendation she might engage you...

505
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,300
as director of the show.

506
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,200
My dear friend, if she combed
the entire world with a fine-tooth comb...

507
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,600
she could never find such a director.

508
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,900
Well, of course, this job wouldn't be
high art, not what you're used to.

509
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,600
Popular stuff, you know.

510
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:26,200
Who are we to laugh at popular music?
It is the very heartbeat of America.

511
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,600
She'd probably pay $2,500
for your services.

512
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,500
$2,500?

513
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,900
That is no laughing matter.

514
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
My liver could spend several weeks
in the sea air.

515
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:42,400
And I'd be sure you would be able to pay
your hotel bill when you wanted to leave.

516
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,500
I accept. Not for the money...

517
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,800
but for the great ideal, popular art!

518
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:53,000
And anything over
the $2,500 I could get you...

519
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,100
we split between us.

520
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,600
What?

521
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,200
That is dishonest! But I do it.

522
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,800
Mrs. Prentiss...

523
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,700
Mr. Schultz is the greatest scenery
and costume designer in the world.

524
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,800
Yeah, that I admit.

525
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,700
Well, he looks expensive.

526
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,500
Now leave that to me.

527
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,200
Nicoleff takes care of everything
and wastes nothing.

528
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,300
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

529
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,800
If he says it, I wouldn't even trouble
to argue about it.

530
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,400
Well, that's very comforting to hear,
because last year...

531
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,400
the costumes and scenery cost me $218...

532
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,700
but that won't happen again.

533
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,900
- Only $218...
- Yes.

534
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,400
Why, my dear Mrs. Prentiss,
that's chickens' food.

535
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,700
You can't put on
a Punch and Judy show for $218.

536
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,700
Now, don't worry about the costs.
Everything will be small and cheap.

537
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,300
Well, I'm glad we all understand that.

538
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,400
Now the time has come
when I got to say something.

539
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,500
Yes, you are right, only I will say it.

540
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,300
Well, you're both too hard to understand.

541
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,900
That is because he talks with accent.

542
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
My friend speaks very bad English,
that's the trouble.

543
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,400
You must excuse it.

544
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,200
You'll pardon me, gentlemen,
but that's the telephone.

545
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:31,200
And remember,
everything is to be small and cheap.

546
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,000
Say, I got no more time to waste
with this hummingbird.

547
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,900
Small, cheap scenery I don't build.

548
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,800
You brought me up here
on a wild duck hunt.

549
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,500
No, now listen.

550
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,800
Forget everything that she told you.

551
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:55,300
Nicoleff will need a gigantic, tremendous
production with exquisite costumes.

552
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,100
We are willing to spend money like water.

553
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,100
We! You're willing to spend her money,
but is she?

554
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,700
Nicoleff can take care of everything,
including her.

555
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,600
Now, wait a minute. This time remember,
I got to get my money.

556
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,200
- Lf I don't...
- Well, when did I never pay you?

557
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,800
The same time
you never paid everybody else.

558
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Now why drag personalities
into this thing?

559
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,200
I don't want to drag in any personals,
but paying when my work is done...

560
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,100
that's something I got to know about.

561
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:23,200
Now remember, my commission is
20% of everything we take her for.

562
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,400
- Remember.
- I forgot it already.

563
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,300
Fifteen percent is the best you get.

564
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,200
You crook!
Is there no honor among people?

565
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,900
Nineteen percent,
or Nicoleff buys from somebody else.

566
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,200
Seventeen and a half percent
is my last word.

567
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,400
Oh, isn't it awful! Isn't it tragic!

568
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,600
- What is tragic?
- I'm dying! I can't stand it!

569
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,600
- Somebody is dead?
- Oh, worse than that!

570
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,200
My bankers just phoned me
that the Honeywell Rubber Company...

571
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,300
has reduced its dividend
from 60 cents to 40 cents...

572
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:56,500
and I have the misfortune
to own a million shares!

573
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,700
That's terrible.

574
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,300
Look, you got my sympathy.

575
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,600
I almost wish I owned them
instead of you.

576
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,600
- Now, don't...
- Oh, don't do that!

577
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,900
Let me see. $6,438,000.

578
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,300
Oh! My income has been reduced a third.

579
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,000
I must cut my expenses to the bone...

580
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,200
to the very bone.

581
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,000
Gentlemen, the show is off.
I can't afford it.

582
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,700
Madam, with those few words,
you have broken my heart.

583
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,500
I don't feel so good myself.

584
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,300
This is a darling boat.

585
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,200
Mr. Lamson lets me use it
whenever I want.

586
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,300
He does?

587
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,400
You know, I like going to the village
much better this way than by car.

588
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,400
All right. We'll always go this way.

589
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,000
- Did you like the movie?
- Very much.

590
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,600
Swell, we'll go again.
They change the bill next Thursday night.

591
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,700
- How about it?
- I'd love to.

592
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,800
- Don't tell me that's a radio.
- All the comforts of home.

593
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,500
Does it play or is it just along for the ride?

594
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,300
Well, it plays if it's in the mood.

595
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,400
- It's in the mood.
- Nice tune.

596
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,400
Everything's sort of nice tonight.

597
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,300
- I wish we didn't have to go straight home.
- Why do we?

598
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,200
Well, it's 9:30 and your mother will worry.

599
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:25,100
Well, that's all right. Mother's never
really happy unless she's worrying.

600
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:30,400
Suppose we dare stop and look
at the stars for a couple of minutes?

601
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,000
I can't think of a better way
to spend a couple of minutes.

602
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,000
Okay, we'll stop.

603
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:55,200
Just look at all those stars.
Millions of them. So clear and lovely.

604
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,000
Dick, I feel poetic.

605
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,300
Now that you've mentioned it...

606
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,900
I've been feeling a little poetic
the last few days myself.

607
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,200
Since when?

608
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,600
- Do you want to know the truth?
- Of course I do.

609
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,200
Well...

610
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,700
since you and I got to know each other.

611
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,300
That's the sweetest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

612
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,200
Twilight comes swinging

613
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,400
Out of the skies

614
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Night winds are singing

615
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,000
Their lullabies

616
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,400
Music brings romance

617
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,100
That's what it's played for

618
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,600
That's what the night

619
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,100
Is made for

620
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,500
In my song of love

621
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,500
The moon above makes the music

622
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:04,800
The words are in my heart

623
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,700
My lips may be afraid

624
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,600
To serenade you tonight

625
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:16,500
But the words are in my heart

626
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,800
Roses red

627
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,400
In rhythm are swaying

628
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,500
And like my heart

629
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,000
They're tenderly saying

630
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,200
My dear, I love you so

631
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,300
And even though I can't say it

632
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:42,900
The words are in my heart

633
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,200
I like that song.

634
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,400
You're not saying that
just to be polite, are you?

635
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,100
Of course not. You know...

636
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,000
that's the first time anyone's
ever sung to me like that before.

637
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,100
Well, it won't be the last time.

638
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,700
"The words are in my heart."

639
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,700
Oh, if that were only true.

640
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,400
Well, it could be, perhaps.

641
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,600
Perhaps?

642
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:20,700
- Well, then you're not sure.
- Are you, Dick?

643
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,900
My dear, I love you so

644
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:30,400
And even though I can't say it

645
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:35,400
The words are in my heart

646
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,000
At the sound of the chime...

647
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:48,000
it will be exactly three seconds
before 10.00.

648
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,000
Ten o'clock? Your mother will fire me.

649
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,600
If she does, she'll have to fire me, too.

650
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,800
We better go home.

651
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,100
Hold on. Here we go.

652
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,100
$20,482,000 at 6%.

653
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,800
Waste more money on charity shows
when I'm practically a pauper...

654
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,500
and my dividend's cut on a million shares.

655
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,500
The $20-million pauper.

656
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,600
- That's a tragedy.
- Yes, it is a tragedy.

657
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,800
But it could be worse.

658
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,000
Sure, you might be a $40-million pauper.

659
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,400
Poor Mosley has two million shares.

660
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,600
At least I'm not alone in my grief.

661
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,100
Nicoleff has a brilliant idea.

662
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,100
You say that your dividends
have been reduced one-third?

663
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,200
Yes.

664
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,700
Beautiful and simple.

665
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,900
You reduce your guarantee one-third.

666
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,900
You guarantee two-thirds of the show...

667
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,800
and I will convince Mosley Thorpe
to guarantee the other third...

668
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,200
making three-thirds!

669
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,500
What a brain!

670
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,000
What a mathematics!

671
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,400
But, gentlemen, I can't afford it.

672
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,700
But think, madam, it is for charity.

673
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,000
Sure. And listen,
anything you spend for the show...

674
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,700
you can take out of your income taxes.

675
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,700
Why, yes. Yes, I can, can't I?
Well, all right then.

676
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,600
Then the next step is to interview
Mosley Thorpe.

677
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,600
As we say in the theater,
the show must go on.

678
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,000
Right.

679
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,700
No. You stay here. Talk to her.

680
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,700
Talk to her about the income tax.
Don't let her change her mind.

681
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:34,700
Mrs. Prentiss, you see,
if you take out from your exemptions...

682
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,500
twice as much
as you put into your income taxes...

683
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,900
and then subtract a different...
You take...

684
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,500
What's the matter?

685
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,200
She's humming again!

686
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:54,000
If I'm not greatly mistaken,
the use of snuff will be generally revived.

687
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,900
- You get that?
- Yes.

688
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,600
Speaking of being generally revived,
how about time out for a little snifter?

689
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,700
I never indulge in alcohol. No.

690
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,800
A nice cold bottle of champagne
isn't really alcohol.

691
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,700
What was it? The 17th or 18th century?

692
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,300
- Where were we?
- Just where we started.

693
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,300
Now, about the future of snuff.

694
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,500
Is there any future in snuff. Question mark.

695
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,300
Oh dear, I don't feel very good.

696
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,600
My throat's getting dry.

697
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,400
Well, go to the window
and take a deep draft of fresh air.

698
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,300
My poor old mother
used to get these dizzy spells.

699
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,900
Nothing would help her
but a glass of champagne.

700
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,600
- Can I get you a glass of water?
- I don't need a chaser.

701
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,400
I need a drink!

702
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,800
Don't come in just yet!

703
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,900
You are Mr. Mosley Thorpe?

704
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,600
Yeah.

705
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,400
Your secret is my secret.
My lips are sealed.

706
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,600
- Why, I tell you, it's all a mistake.
- Certainly.

707
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,700
- We are no longer schoolboys.
- No.

708
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,600
Now is an excellent time
to discuss a little business.

709
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:13,300
You can guarantee two-thirds of
the expenses of the annual charity show.

710
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,600
But I have no interest in shows.
My life is devoted to snuff.

711
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,200
And beautiful women.

712
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,700
The lady fainted. I couldn't let her fall.

713
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,400
- She fainted...
- Why, certainly.

714
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,700
We are both men of the world.

715
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,200
I can put you down for two-thirds?

716
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,900
Otherwise, we are both talking
about the same thing.

717
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:34,000
Well, I guess you've got me.

718
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,000
- Well, the bargain is sealed, my friend?
- Yeah.

719
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,700
My brain is befuddled with all this.

720
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,900
- I'm going out for a walk.
- Certainly.

721
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,400
Wait a minute. Where's my cut?

722
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:53,900
What cut?

723
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:57,000
Listen, baby, you wouldn't have got
to first base without my phony faint.

724
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,100
This is an honest business transaction.

725
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,400
- I don't know what you are talking about.
- Come on, come on. Give!

726
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,500
Not one cent will I give you.

727
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,500
Say, did he agree to put up
one-third of the money?

728
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,500
Because, listen, if he did, Mrs. Prentiss is...

729
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,400
positively in the bag
for the other two-thirds.

730
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,500
How do you like that? The old lady's
in for two-thirds and so is Mosley.

731
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,500
Idiot, you talk too much with your mouth.

732
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,000
Two-thirds and two-thirds
is four-thirds in any country.

733
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:19,500
Well, that's the way I figure it.

734
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,600
And, personally, I wouldn't play ball
unless I get one-half of the fourth third.

735
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:27,400
You see that I get 19% of what you
get for the costumes and scenery.

736
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,600
That's all you got to worry about.

737
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:31,500
- The extra third was my idea.
- I get one-third of that extra third...

738
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,100
or I go right to Mrs. Prentiss and spill.

739
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,500
Now, that's right. That's fair enough.

740
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,000
Give her one-third
of the fourth third that I get half of...

741
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,100
and then split the rest with me. It's easy.

742
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,100
- You don't have to even figure it.
- Thieves! Bandits! Cutthroats!

743
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,400
I'll show you who's a cutthroat,
you swindler!

744
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,000
You cannot insult Nicoleff!

745
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:48,000
The split goes three ways
and don't you forget it!

746
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,400
- I get one-third...
- You insult Nicoleff!

747
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,100
I'll show you who's a swindler,
you cutthroat!

748
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,500
I don't care for you!

749
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,600
I don't care who you go to!

750
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,500
Operator. Operator!

751
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,200
There's some lunatics screaming
in the room just below mine.

752
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:10,500
Tell the manager they must stop
at once or I shall leave the hotel.

753
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,500
You both ought to be in jail!

754
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,200
I got to get one-half of all the thirds
she's got coming to her!

755
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,300
You are a thief!

756
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,300
Listen, if you don't pay me right now,
I'm going to see Mrs. Prentiss.

757
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,200
Wait, wait. I make a fair offer.

758
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,400
A fair offer from you is an impossible.

759
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,500
To prove that I am not greedy...

760
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,800
she will receive 10% of the fourth third.

761
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,600
I'm seeing Mrs. Prentiss!

762
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,500
Now, listen to rosin. Reason.

763
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,100
Don't be in such a hurry about it.

764
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,500
I believe in live and let live. We make it 15.

765
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,700
Ja, and remember...

766
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,400
one-half of that comes out
of your half of the fourth third.

767
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,900
It's cut three ways or no dice.

768
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,300
- Whatever it is, I get my cut.
- Hello, Mr. Lamson. How do you feel?

769
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,600
I feel like making some money.

770
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,300
Now, we got to have a fifth third.

771
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,400
Who is this?

772
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,600
I'm the fellow that gets 25% of anything
anybody gets around here.

773
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,700
Another robber. The house is full of them.

774
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,100
And besides,
one-half of all he makes over $2,500.

775
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,400
That's your hard luck
because I get one-third of a third.

776
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,500
Well, that only leaves me
one-half of a third.

777
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,700
- And I get one-fourth of one-third.
- Say, wait a minute.

778
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,200
If we split it up any more,
we got nothing but splinters.

779
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,800
Vampires! You are draining
the blood from my heart!

780
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,600
Your heart? Your heart?

781
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,400
Pardon me. Wrong room.

782
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,200
I'll show you!

783
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,900
Will you stop that noise?

784
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:27,900
All I ask is...

785
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,000
It's been a grand evening, Dick.
Thanks so much.

786
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,000
- Gee, Ann, l...
- What?

787
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,900
Well, I certainly like my job.

788
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,600
I like it, too.

789
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:43,100
- See you tomorrow?
- Bright and early.

790
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,200
- Good night.
- Good night.

791
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,100
Ta-ta, sweetheart.

792
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:00,300
I'm so happy, I feel like a bird.

793
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,500
Flutter, flutter.

794
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,500
Okay. I'll see if I can find you some worms.
Good night, Humbie!

795
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,200
Good night, my dear.

796
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,200
I'm a bird. I'm a bird.

797
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:16,500
I'm so happy, I am a little bird.

798
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,000
I'm a little bird.

799
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,900
$80,000 at 4.5%. $80,000...

800
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,400
Mother, I'm in love again.

801
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,400
That's the last straw!

802
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:46,400
You bad, wicked, naughty boy.
Shame on you! Shame on you!

803
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,500
Mother, what's the matter?

804
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,700
It's Humbolt, he's driving me crazy!
He's in love again!

805
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,800
- Mother, control yourself.
- I can't control myself.

806
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,400
This is going to cost me another $100,000.

807
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,200
Me for bed. See you in the morning.

808
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,400
- I'm going to phone my...
- Mother!

809
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,400
Why, hello, Mother.

810
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,400
- Arline, I've broken the news to Mother.
- What did she say?

811
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,700
She started throwing things at me.

812
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,400
That's alright. She always does.
It's a very good sign for us.

813
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,300
In other words, she didn't really
disapprove or she'd have shot you.

814
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,700
Let's not talk about Mother.
Let's discuss us.

815
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,700
- For instance?
- Well, our marriage, our honeymoon...

816
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,300
our first moments alone.

817
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,600
I've never been so in love in all my life.

818
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,900
Arline! Arline!

819
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,500
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

820
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,500
Honey, the set-up's all wrong. I haven't...

821
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,700
Well, I haven't the right
to love you the way I do.

822
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,300
Now, don't tell me
you're frightened over...

823
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,400
such an unimportant thing
as Mother's money.

824
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,000
No, it isn't that. It's...

825
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,100
Well, then what are you so upset about?

826
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,300
My agreement with your mother.

827
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,400
Looks like I'm going to break it again.

828
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,000
Shall I help you?

829
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:24,000
Hello. Little worried about your new job?

830
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,800
Arline, I hardly know how to say this...

831
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:33,900
but I'm afraid I've done you
a pretty dirty trick.

832
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,200
Old Devil Conscience
knocking at your door?

833
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,000
I guess that's it.

834
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,600
- You and I have been...
- Don't fret about me, dear.

835
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,100
Well, we're engaged and...

836
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,300
And I've decided that
we're not cut out for each other.

837
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:50,400
That it would be better for us both
if we end up just pals.

838
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,900
Arline, you're not doing this
just to help me out?

839
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,100
Don't be so conceited, you mug.

840
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,600
Maybe I've met someone I like better.

841
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
You deserve the finest man in the world.

842
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,600
Till he comes along, I'll take a rich one.

843
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,300
- Here's wishing you all the best.
- Many happy returns.

844
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,900
After I say that line, what do I do?

845
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,300
You kiss me.

846
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,900
Yeah, it says so right there
in black and white.

847
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,800
Well, as long as it's in black and white.

848
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:24,500
- Is that right?
- Swell.

849
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,300
- Go to the head of the class.
- Ann Prentiss!

850
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,800
It's all right, Mother, we're just
rehearsing our parts for the show.

851
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:33,600
They are the only two who seem to grasp
the principles of acting.

852
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:36,100
Yes, well, it didn't look like acting to me.

853
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,800
- Mrs. Prentiss...
- Of course it was, Mother.

854
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,100
Why, you don't think
we'd do that in public, do you?

855
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:44,000
Well, I don't know, I'm sure.
You've changed so much lately.

856
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,700
Mr. Nicoleff, I rely on you...

857
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:49,600
to see that my daughter
does not rehearse too much.

858
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,200
Gee, thanks a lot, Nicky.

859
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,100
What you doing?

860
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,500
Looking for some more
black and white kisses.

861
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:03,900
Please, everybody!
Take your position for the dagger dance!

862
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,500
Take the first position
for the dagger dance!

863
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,800
Everybody, quickly!

864
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,000
You remember the first position?

865
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,800
Commence.

866
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,800
Wait! Wait! Do not commence.

867
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,500
Where is Mr. Prentiss?

868
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,100
Please! Who does not understand English?

869
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:28,800
Where is Mr. Humbolt Prentiss?

870
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,000
Yes, yes, absolutely.

871
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:39,800
Do you really?

872
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,000
Double crisscross my heart
and hope to die.

873
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,000
- Mr. Prentiss.
- I'm here.

874
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,500
Well, that's just it.
You are here when you should be there!

875
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,800
- We need you to rehearse.
- Can't rehearse. I lost my dagger.

876
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,000
Don't you draw a knife on me.

877
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,500
This is serious business, Mr. Prentiss.
Come on.

878
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,300
Stick around, stick around.

879
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,700
Mr. Prentiss, take your position!

880
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,400
Now rehearse!

881
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,900
More tempo this time. Commence.

882
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,200
Isn't that a peach of a tune? So barbaric.

883
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,500
Did I have lunch today?

884
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:17,500
Yes?

885
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,700
Mosley.

886
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,100
I'm in the middle of
a very important chapter.

887
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,200
Mosley, I think that you're neglecting Ann.

888
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:27,700
If you take more of an interest in my show
then you could see her every day.

889
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,500
But I am interested in your show, Mrs. P.

890
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,000
No, I mean more of an active interest.

891
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:33,400
Didn't you write the lyrics
for your class show at college?

892
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,400
Just a mere whim and a fancy of youth.

893
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:39,000
Well, I just found out that rehearsals
can be very, very important.

894
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:40,800
Now, why don't you write a song for us?

895
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:43,300
Then you can come
to rehearsals every day.

896
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:46,600
Perhaps I might. My brain is
a little foggy from too much thinking.

897
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,400
Well, you see,
writing a song would help relax you.

898
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,300
Now get along with it.

899
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:55,100
I'll dash it off in a few moments. Most of
my big hits were done just like that.

900
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,200
- Excellent, Mosley. I'm counting on you.
- Yes.

901
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,000
Birds in the trees.

902
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:16,500
- You look so cute doing that.
- I bet you say that to all the boys.

903
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:19,600
No, you look much better
than any of the others.

904
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,400
I could do this lots better,
but I'm frightened.

905
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,700
He's got me scared to death
with that meat ax he carries.

906
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,200
You!

907
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,900
Writing a song is
a rather amusing diversion.

908
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
- Yes, from snuff.
- Yes, snuff.

909
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,800
Snuff is not to be sneezed at.

910
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,900
Did you hear what I did?
I made a joke of it.

911
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,800
Snuff is not to be sneezed at.

912
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,100
Mr. Thorpe, you're such a wit.

913
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,600
Yeah, I do say
rather clever things occasionally.

914
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,200
- Yes.
- Now, about this song...

915
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:54,900
shall we write something new
and something dashing?

916
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,100
Let's not. Let's write a beautiful love song.

917
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:01,300
A love song...
How do you get such good ideas?

918
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,900
I'm inspired by being with you.

919
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,100
- Call the girl Betty after me.
- Betty. Betty.

920
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,500
Yes, that's very good. Betty, Betty...

921
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,900
my darling, Betty. Yes.

922
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,800
- Now what rhymes with Betty?
- Spaghetti.

923
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,500
Spaghetti.

924
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,700
No, that's not the proper mood
for a love song.

925
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,900
Well, it might do for an Italian love song.

926
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Yes, it might at that, yes.

927
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:26,300
My darling, spaghetti... Betty.

928
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:34,400
So. Gracefully, like a swan.

929
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,000
The very quintessence of grace.

930
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,800
Like a swan.

931
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,500
A swan. Not like a geese!

932
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:43,800
Like a swan!

933
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,300
Hasn't anybody here ever seen a swan?

934
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:47,500
Well?

935
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,900
We have swans
on our estate just outside of Philadelphia.

936
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,300
- Like that?
- Yes.

937
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,800
That is a Philadelphia swan.
Come, quickly.

938
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:56,700
Everybody, on your feet.
From the beginning.

939
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,000
Commence!

940
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,100
There you are, Mr. Thorpe.
There's the lyric for your new song.

941
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:12,500
- I'm certainly proud of you.
- Well, I'm rather proud of it myself.

942
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:13,700
Listen to it.

943
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,100
"Love is all that matters after all, dear.

944
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,100
"Nothing else, dear. Nothing else but you."

945
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,800
Very good. Very good.

946
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:22,500
"Just a kiss, a squeeze, a sigh,
and you, dear.

947
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,800
"Tell me that you'll marry me, please do."

948
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,200
It gets better as it goes along.
Very, very good.

949
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,200
"Let me put the ring
upon your finger, Betty.

950
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:30,900
"You and I will be one instead of"...

951
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,300
Well, what became of the spaghetti
I had in here?

952
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:37,300
- You took it out.
- Did I? Yes, I guess I did.

953
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,700
"My heart melts
as your sweet kisses linger.

954
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:42,400
"Nothing matters, dear.
Nothing but love and you."

955
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,200
It's wonderful. It's wonderful.

956
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,100
It's one of the best things ever I wrote,
if I do say so myself.

957
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,800
It's simply marvelous. You know,
it keeps running through my head.

958
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,000
They say that's always the way
you can tell a good song.

959
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:55,300
Songs used to keep running through
my head until I had my sinus operation.

960
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,200
I wonder if you'd autograph a copy to me.

961
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,000
I've quite a collection
of famous autographs.

962
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:02,300
Sure. My uncle used to collect autographs.
Those and field mice. Yeah.

963
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:12,100
There you are.

964
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,900
I'll never forget you for this, Mr. Thorpe.

965
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,400
Good heavens, 4:30! What day is it?

966
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,000
- Thursday.
- Thursday?

967
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:23,300
I usually have my hair cut on Wednesday.
I've lost a day.

968
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,200
What's the matter with me?

969
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,500
Will there be anything else today,
Mr. Thorpe?

970
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,000
No, that's all today.

971
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:31,300
We'll continue with the snuff
first thing in the morning.

972
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,200
Got to get my hair cut.

973
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:40,100
Mosley, darling.
A haircut's not all you're going to get.

974
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:01,700
I'm in the money
The skies are sunny

975
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:05,200
I'll get a lot of what it takes to get along

976
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,600
Oh, yes. There you are.

977
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:45,500
And, Mr. Hubbard,
I'm sure you'll enjoy the show.

978
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:49,000
Mrs. Wood, right in the center.
Everything's right in the center.

979
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,700
Oh, $50, I can't change that.

980
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,800
- Lf you think I'm going to spend $50...
- Well, I shall look you up...

981
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,000
right after the show.

982
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:58,000
Remember, everything's
in the sacred cause of milk.

983
00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:59,100
Next, please.

984
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,200
What did I tell you? It's a sellout.

985
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:10,700
- The name of Nicoleff still draws them in.
- At $25 a throw.

986
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,700
Looks like baby's all set
for a new pair of shoes.

987
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:16,300
Yeah? Well, before you start shoeing
any children around here, I got to be paid.

988
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,500
Sold out! $7,500!

989
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,800
More money than I've ever taken in before.

990
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:28,900
I do hope the grounds are well-policed,
because I'm a little uneasy...

991
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,700
carrying so much money around with me.

992
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:31,900
Yeah? Well, let me hold it for you.

993
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,700
Now, no thief would never suspect
poor little me of all that cash.

994
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,700
Let me put it in the hotel safe.

995
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,700
A safe to a burglar
is like a bottle to a corkscrew.

996
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,100
Let me hide the cash.
I got on a money belt.

997
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:43,700
I'll put it right here, next to my heart.

998
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,300
Madam, permit me to assist you.

999
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:48,800
Nicoleff takes care of everything.

1000
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:53,100
But on second thought,
I think I'll take care of the money myself.

1001
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,200
Oh, that reminds me, Mrs. Prentiss,
speaking of money.

1002
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:59,300
Here is my scenery and costume bill
for the production.

1003
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,800
Dirt cheap, and cheap dirt, at that.

1004
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,900
Well, I'm very glad to hear that,
Mr. Schultz...

1005
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,400
because I'm too busy
to bother with incidentals.

1006
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:10,000
I'll pay your bill and the ushers
out of the petty cash.

1007
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:13,300
Mosley! If you'll excuse me
just a second, please.

1008
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:16,700
So now I'm an incidental
with petties and ushers.

1009
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,900
Have you told her yet
how much money she owes me?

1010
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,100
- That is of small importance.
- Small importance?

1011
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,700
$40,000, small importance?

1012
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,700
Look here, Nicoleff, for not much
longer will I be bounced around...

1013
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:26,800
from post to pillar!

1014
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,500
Mosley, I must speak to you.

1015
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,200
I want you to keep the total receipts,
$7,500.

1016
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,800
I know I can trust you, Mosley.

1017
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,900
I'm really touched by this confidence,
but this...

1018
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,100
I'm glad you're touched,
but just as a matter of form...

1019
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,600
would you mind signing a receipt for me?

1020
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:48,000
- Anything to oblige a lovely lady.
- Thank you.

1021
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,300
There we are.
Now, I'll meet you at our table later on.

1022
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,900
I have 1,001 things to do
before the curtain.

1023
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,300
Very well.

1024
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:02,800
Hi, there, Mosley.

1025
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:05,000
That's a lot of beautiful cash
you've got on your hip.

1026
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,100
I don't see why my cash
should concern you.

1027
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,200
- No?
- No.

1028
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:10,700
Toss that mastermind of yours
into high and listen.

1029
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:11,900
I'll make you an even swap.

1030
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,900
Your lyric, autographed to me
with love and kisses, for that bankroll.

1031
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,900
- I don't quite catch on.
- Well, you will very soon, darling.

1032
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,300
Now look, the words to the song
on your own writing paper...

1033
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,000
addressed to me and signed by you...

1034
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:23,900
make it look as though
you proposed to me.

1035
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,800
Ridiculous. I just gave you my autograph.

1036
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:28,100
Well, I only wanted your autograph
to make it all legal.

1037
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:30,500
Now, I'm a man of the world.
I know a bluff when I see one.

1038
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:31,900
It may sound like a bluff to you...

1039
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,100
but it's money in the sock
to me and my lawyers. Have a look.

1040
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:53,500
Are you by any chance
trying to blackmail me?

1041
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,900
Mr. Thorpe, such talk.

1042
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,900
All I'm trying to convey is that
Scofield, Winthrop, Green and Hazen...

1043
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,100
haven't lost a suit
since breach of promise was invented.

1044
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:02,300
The shysters!
They haven't got a leg to stand on.

1045
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,900
Darling, you've given them
as many legs as a centipede.

1046
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,700
Now how about it,
will you settle out of court?

1047
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:10,900
Certainly not.
You were my stenographer, nothing more.

1048
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,800
Okay, Mosley, old snuff.
I gave you your chance.

1049
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:15,700
I'll see you in the tabloids.

1050
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:25,000
Dick, can you help a fellow? I'm lost.

1051
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,700
Which one of these doghouses is mine?

1052
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,800
Honey, I think you're over there
around the corner.

1053
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:29,900
Thanks, pal.

1054
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,100
Miss Shaw, why are you not ready?

1055
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,000
I just this minute got off duty.

1056
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:37,300
So, my cast is late
because she has to sell cigarettes.

1057
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:38,900
Hurry, I help you dress quick.

1058
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,900
Remind me after the show
to slap your face.

1059
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,900
Nicoleff never forgets.

1060
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:47,100
- Who is it?
- It's me, honey, how're you doing?

1061
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,800
Well, just a minute. All right.

1062
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,700
- Say, aren't you dressed yet?
- Well, not quite.

1063
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,000
Well, look,
we go on in a couple of minutes.

1064
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:59,500
- You're not nervous, are you?
- Well, not while you're here.

1065
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:02,900
What is this?
Every time I see you two, you're kissing.

1066
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,800
Well, you always catch us
when we're rehearsing.

1067
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:07,300
I've stood enough of this nonsense.
It must stop at once.

1068
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,900
Mrs. Prentiss, you might as well
realize this now.

1069
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:14,100
- Ann and I are going to be married.
- Married? How perfectly ridiculous.

1070
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:17,400
I'll have you run out of the hotel.
I'll have you run out of the state...

1071
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,200
you male gold digger!

1072
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:23,500
My darlings, in two minutes
you carry the glory of Nicoleff...

1073
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,100
to a distinguished audience.

1074
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,500
Neither my daughter nor this person
will appear in the show.

1075
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,700
I just found them
rehearsing another love scene.

1076
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:34,000
- But this is madness!
- Maybe it was, but it isn't anymore.

1077
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:36,500
But you cannot take
my leading lady, my leading man!

1078
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,900
- We will have to put off the show!
- Well, if we have to, we have to.

1079
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,500
This is the end! This is the end!

1080
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:47,300
Then you will give me back the $7,500
so that I can reimburse the audience.

1081
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
You mean,
we have to give the money back?

1082
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,400
It is the only thing remaining to be done
before Nicoleff commits suicide!

1083
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,900
But can't you replace my daughter
and this man?

1084
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,400
Lmpossible, madam, on such short notice.

1085
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:02,200
Well, if it's a question of
returning the money...

1086
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:03,900
of course I shall allow them to appear.

1087
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,600
Madam is glorious.

1088
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,200
Nicoleff lives again.

1089
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:11,700
Stop chewing on my fingers.

1090
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,500
Hurry, my children,
the music approaches the cue.

1091
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,900
I'll allow you to play, but on one condition.

1092
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,100
And that is that you marry Mosley
immediately after...

1093
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,400
- this evening's performance.
- I won't. I won't marry him.

1094
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:25,100
- You'll do exactly as I say.
- I won't marry that quarter-wit.

1095
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,200
I wouldn't if he were...

1096
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:27,900
We'll discuss this matter after our number.

1097
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,100
I'll tell you right now,
there is nothing to discuss.

1098
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:32,900
You will marry Mosley tonight.

1099
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:44,100
Mosley, something terribly unfortunate
has occurred.

1100
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:45,500
Yes, it's all a terrible mistake.

1101
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:48,400
I'm glad you take it that way,
but you and I will rectify it.

1102
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,100
Yes. How did you find out about all this?

1103
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,500
I know everything
that's going on around here.

1104
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,200
I hope you're not provoked at me.

1105
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:56,300
No, you've been
merely weak and vacillating.

1106
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,000
- Yeah.
- But we're going to change all that.

1107
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,800
Twilight comes swinging

1108
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:21,100
Out of the skies

1109
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:25,500
Night winds are singing

1110
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:28,900
Their lullabies

1111
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:32,200
Music brings romance

1112
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:35,200
That's what it's played for

1113
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:40,300
That's what the night is made for

1114
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,800
In my song of love

1115
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:51,400
The moon above makes the music

1116
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:56,000
The words are in my heart

1117
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:01,800
My lips may be afraid

1118
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:04,700
To serenade you tonight

1119
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:09,700
But the words are in my heart

1120
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:15,900
Roses red

1121
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:20,100
In rhythm are swaying

1122
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:24,000
And like my heart

1123
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,200
They're tenderly saying

1124
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:32,400
My dear, I love you so

1125
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:37,400
And even though I can't say it

1126
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:43,100
The words are in my heart

1127
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:47,200
My dear, I love you so

1128
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:51,800
And even though I can't say it

1129
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:18,300
Come along, Mosley.
We have no time to lose.

1130
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:19,400
Why not?

1131
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:22,500
Because you've got to tell Ann
you're going to marry her right away.

1132
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:25,000
Then I better call up my tailor
about getting a new blue suit.

1133
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:27,100
Mosley, you exasperate me at times.

1134
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:37,900
Show Ann that you're in earnest. Be firm.
Do you think you can?

1135
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:40,100
- I'm almost positive, yes.
- Simply sweep her off her feet!

1136
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:42,000
Well, don't you think
that's a trifle undignified?

1137
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:43,200
Stop quibbling, Mosley.

1138
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:45,700
I know a justice of the peace
who will marry you for $2...

1139
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,000
if you get there before midnight.

1140
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,400
We must get there before 12:00
because I go to bed at 11:00.

1141
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:53,600
Here he comes now. Beat it.
Get behind that tree.

1142
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,600
- Mr. T. Mosley Thorpe?
- Yes, the Third.

1143
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,200
I'm Haggarty of the Boston Daily Express.

1144
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:02,100
- That's an evening paper, isn't it?
- Sure, but...

1145
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,600
I'm not interested in evening papers.
I read the morning paper.

1146
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:07,600
Do you know Scofield, Winthrop,
Green and Hazen, the law firm?

1147
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:09,500
I know a Mr. Hazen, but he's a contractor.

1148
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:12,000
He built the biggest fish market
in Cincinnati.

1149
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:14,300
- How are you?
- Yeah, but we got a hot tip.

1150
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:17,600
Now, I understand this law firm is gonna
pack a heavy breach of promise suit...

1151
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:19,600
against you, for a Miss Betty Hawes.
What about it?

1152
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:22,200
- Why, I never even heard of her.
- Why, Mosley Thorpe.

1153
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,900
She was your stenographer. I smell a rat.

1154
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,200
No rat, just some letters,
then I got my hair cut...

1155
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:28,300
went out and got a shave.

1156
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,400
As I understand it, you're going to claim...

1157
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,000
that you were dictating a song.

1158
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:35,100
But she's going to prove
that you asked her to marry you...

1159
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:36,300
or words to that effect.

1160
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,600
- Now, if you'll come clean...
- It's a conspiracy!

1161
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,400
I'm an innocent bystander, a victim.

1162
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:43,300
I've heard enough!
You contemptible coward.

1163
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:46,700
Engaged to my daughter and lollygagging
around with a public stenographer.

1164
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,200
Can I be blamed because I can't typewrite,
and must dictate?

1165
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:51,100
- So you were dictating, were you?
- Yes, I was...

1166
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:52,400
You were working, were you?

1167
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,900
- Let's grab this thing, quick.
- You wolf in sheep's clothing!

1168
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,600
If I ever find you near my daughter
again I'll have you arrested.

1169
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:00,300
Writing about snuff, were you?
You menace to innocent women!

1170
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,600
You viper!

1171
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:02,600
Let it go.

1172
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:06,000
- Thanks a lot, Mr. Thorpe.
- Yeah.

1173
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:08,400
- We'll see you on the front page.
- Yeah.

1174
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:18,800
- Give me my money.
- Why, I don't understand you.

1175
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:22,300
No more lies, Mr. Thorpe.
I very foolishly entrusted $7,500 to you.

1176
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:25,600
Will you give it back to me
or shall I charge you with grand larceny?

1177
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:28,500
And if one dollar is missing,
I shall send for the police.

1178
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:31,100
- Why, Mrs. P, do you question my honor?
- There is your receipt.

1179
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:33,700
Now I am getting angry.
A joke is a joke, but when my honor...

1180
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:37,100
And speaking of honor reminds me,
I have a real man in the family.

1181
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,200
I shall have Humbolt
give you a good thrashing.

1182
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:42,000
Don't forget I used to be pretty good
with the gloves myself. See?

1183
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,700
I shall forbid Humbolt to use gloves
when he thrashes you.

1184
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:54,700
Humbolt, if you have a spark of manhood
in you, here's your chance to prove it.

1185
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:55,800
What's up, Mom?

1186
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:57,800
Mosley Thorpe has been revealed
in his true colors.

1187
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:59,400
He's trifling with your sister's affections.

1188
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:00,600
- No.
- Yes!

1189
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:04,100
And I want Humbolt to thrash him
within an inch of his miserable life.

1190
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:07,800
- With pleasure.
- That's my boy speaking.

1191
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,400
- But I've got to finish the show first.
- Well, immediately afterwards then.

1192
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:15,200
- After that I'm going on my honeymoon.
- Honeymoon?

1193
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,900
Did I hear you say "honeymoon"?

1194
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:23,400
Yes, Mother, I was married yesterday.
Meet the missis.

1195
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,100
I'll go mad!

1196
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:30,800
Yes, don't worry, Mother.
I'll take care of Mosley.

1197
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,100
Come on, put them up.

1198
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:40,800
I'll lick 10 men like you. I'm not afraid
of you or your whole family. Put them up.

1199
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:43,200
- Were you talking to me?
- What?

1200
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:47,600
Hello, how are you?

1201
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:15,200
Here he is, boys!

1202
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:18,400
Mr. Thorpe! Just a minute, Mr. Thorpe!

1203
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:19,900
How about a statement here?

1204
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,200
What about this
breach of promise case, Mr. Thorpe?

1205
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,100
You gonna marry Miss Hawes or pay off?

1206
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:25,700
Did you write your love letters in rhyme?

1207
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,300
What do you think of Casanova as a lover?

1208
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:30,800
I'm through with love.
I'm through with love forever. Forever!

1209
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:42,400
Go get him, boys.
He stole all the soap boxes in the hotel.

1210
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:43,500
What a story!

1211
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:56,200
Come on along and listen to

1212
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:59,000
The lullaby of Broadway

1213
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:01,600
The hip-hooray and ballyhoo

1214
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:04,100
The lullaby of Broadway

1215
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:06,500
The rumble of the subway train

1216
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,900
The rattle of the taxis

1217
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:11,400
The daffodils who entertain

1218
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,200
At Angelo's and Maxie's

1219
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:16,500
When a Broadway baby says good night

1220
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:18,900
It's early in the morning

1221
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:21,600
Manhattan babies don't sleep tight

1222
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:23,600
Until the dawn

1223
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:28,800
Good night, baby

1224
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:31,300
Good night

1225
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,800
Milkman's on his way

1226
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,300
Sleep tight, baby

1227
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,100
Sleep tight

1228
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,000
Let's call it a day

1229
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:46,400
Come on along and listen to

1230
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,800
The lullaby of Broadway

1231
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:51,200
The hi-dee-hi and boop-a-doo

1232
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:53,600
The lullaby of Broadway

1233
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:56,300
The band begins to go to town

1234
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,800
And everyone goes crazy

1235
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:01,100
You rock-a-bye your baby around

1236
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,000
Till everything gets hazy

1237
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:06,200
Hush-a-bye
I'll buy you this and that

1238
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:08,500
You hear a daddy saying

1239
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:11,000
And baby goes home to her flat

1240
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:13,600
To sleep all day

1241
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:18,300
Good night, baby

1242
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:20,900
Good night

1243
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:23,000
Milkman's on his way

1244
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:28,000
Sleep tight, baby

1245
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,600
Sleep tight

1246
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:34,100
Let's call it a day

1247
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,200
Listen to

1248
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:43,100
The lullaby

1249
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:49,000
Of old Broadway

1250
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:32,600
Good night, baby

1251
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:35,100
Good night

1252
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,100
Milkman's on his way

1253
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:41,500
Sleep tight, baby

1254
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:44,500
Sleep tight

1255
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:46,200
I'll call it a day

1256
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:56,100
A table for two
A lady divine

1257
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:58,100
A rhapsody blue
A bottle of wine

1258
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:02,600
Then you'll listen to a siren's song
Come and shuffle along

1259
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:05,800
Come and dance

1260
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:07,700
My sweetie may not let me

1261
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:10,500
Come and dance

1262
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:12,700
Why don't you come and get me?

1263
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:15,900
Come and dance
The band is gonna go to town

1264
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,800
Come on and let's go crazy

1265
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:22,600
We'll turn the whole town upside down
Till everything gets hazy

1266
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:27,700
Come along with us and dodge the sun
Until the early morning

1267
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:33,100
We've got to get in all our fun
Before the dawn

1268
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:37,700
Look out, baby

1269
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,600
Look out

1270
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:43,100
Baby, come and play

1271
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:47,800
Watch out, baby

1272
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:50,600
Watch out

1273
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:52,800
While we swing and sway

1274
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:57,800
Listen to the lullaby of old Broadway

1275
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,200
Come along and listen to

1276
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:20,400
The lullaby of Broadway

1277
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:23,200
The hi-dee-hi and boop-a-doo

1278
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:25,100
The lullaby of Broadway

1279
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:28,200
The band begins to go to town

1280
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,700
And every one goes crazy

1281
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:33,700
You rock-a-bye your baby around

1282
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:35,400
Till everything gets hazy

1283
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:38,500
Hush-a-bye
I'll buy you this and that

1284
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,300
You hear a daddy saying

1285
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:43,900
And baby goes home to her flat

1286
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:46,700
To sleep all day

1287
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:51,700
Good night, baby

1288
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,300
Good night

1289
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:56,700
Milkman's on his way

1290
01:31:57,200 --> 01:32:01,900
Sleep tight, baby

1291
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:04,600
Sleep tight

1292
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:08,200
Let's call it a day

1293
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:13,300
Listen to the lullaby

1294
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:19,500
Of old Broadway

1295
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:45,100
- Everyone's after my money.
- I'm all ready, darling.

1296
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:47,100
You won't get one penny
of my money, young man.

1297
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:49,700
Neither will my daughter.
I'll leave everything to the milk fund.

1298
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:52,500
That's splendid. I'll think of you
every time I drink a milkshake.

1299
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:55,600
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
- I haven't got time. I'm too happy.

1300
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:57,300
- Well, good luck, Mother.
- Good luck?

1301
01:32:57,400 --> 01:33:00,200
You marrying a penniless adventurer.
Humbolt already married.

1302
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:01,400
My dividend's cut.

1303
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:04,800
Mosley a cad. And that fearful
scenery man threatening to sue me.

1304
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:06,900
A fortune lost in that show.

1305
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,200
That awful, dreadful show.
That's been the cause of all my troubles.

1306
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:12,700
- Chin up, Ma. It might be worse.
- It couldn't possibly be.

1307
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:17,200
- Yes, you might marry Nicoleff.
- Go away, I can't see anyone.

1308
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:21,100
Wait, please do not go!
Something important!

1309
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:24,800
- Honored madam.
- Will you stop biting my fingers?

1310
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:27,600
This has been the most pleasant
engagement of my career.

1311
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:30,200
May I present to you
a tiny token of my esteem?

1312
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:31,300
Well, what is it?

1313
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:36,400
A priceless solid silver fruit dish,
given to me by the Grand Duke Alexis...

1314
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:39,600
after seeing my production of
Midsummer Night's Dream...

1315
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:43,400
- with an all-Eskimo cast.
- Well, thank you very much.

1316
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:48,800
Hello. What?

1317
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:50,700
Wait a minute. I'll ask her.

1318
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:53,900
It's the hotel jewelry store. Mr. Nicoleff
just bought a silver fruit dish...

1319
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,500
and charged it to your account,
and the jeweler wants to know...

1320
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:57,600
if it's all right.

1321
01:33:57,700 --> 01:34:00,400
I beg your pardon, madam, a luncheon
engagement with Max Reinhardt.

1322
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,400
You wretch! You scoundrel!

1323
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:08,400
And that'll cost you $500
and seven years' bad luck.

1324
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:10,400
- Mother.
- There, there, there.

1325
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:12,500
- Mother, you all right?
- She'll be fine in a minute.

1326
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:15,400
- Just an acute case of Nicoleff.
- Where am I?
