00:00:00,346 --> 00:00:02,115
<i>So here's what you missed
on Glee:</i>

2
00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:03,355
<i>McKinley's doing West Side
Story, and everyone's excited,</i>

3
00:00:03,417 --> 00:00:04,849
<i>especially Coach Beiste
and Emma and Artie,</i>

4
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,390
<i>because they're the directors.
Blaine got the lead,</i>

5
00:00:06,435 --> 00:00:08,111
<i>and so did Rachel, which made
Mercedes quit the glee club</i>

6
00:00:08,147 --> 00:00:09,806
<i>and join Shelby's Troubletones
with Santana and Brittany.</i>

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,808
<i>Mike Chang's playing Riff,
even though his dad told him</i>

8
00:00:11,842 --> 00:00:13,510
<i>he can't be a dancer.
Riff is perfect for you.</i>

9
00:00:13,526 --> 00:00:15,541
<i>I think he wants him to go to
doctor college or something.</i>

10
00:00:15,569 --> 00:00:16,844
<i>And that's what you missed
on Glee.</i>

11
00:00:19,524 --> 00:00:21,487

13
00:00:25,476 --> 00:00:28,250
<i>It doesn't matter if
he's in prison like Gandhi,</i>

14
00:00:28,303 --> 00:00:30,867
<i>or trapped inside a woman's
body like Chaz Bono,</i>

15
00:00:30,895 --> 00:00:32,468
<i>or stuck in a wheelchair
like me,</i>

16
00:00:32,501 --> 00:00:36,854
<i>when a man finds his calling,
all is right in his world.</i>

17
00:00:36,888 --> 00:00:39,307
<i>I still ve performing,
but thanks to Mr. Shue</i>

18
00:00:39,352 --> 00:00:41,601
<i>and the school musical,
I've finally discovered</i>

19
00:00:41,654 --> 00:00:42,843
<i>my true passion...</i>

20
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:44,185
<i>bossing everyone around.</i>

21
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:45,763
<i>I mean directing.</i>

22
00:00:45,825 --> 00:00:47,397
<i>The key to being a director</i>

23
00:00:47,441 --> 00:00:48,996

about everything.</i>

24
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:50,079
No.

25
00:00:50,106 --> 00:00:51,490
<i>Even stuff you have no id.</i>

26
00:00:51,523 --> 00:00:53,115
No.
I think it's great.

27
00:00:53,156 --> 00:00:54,571
Go.

28
00:00:54,616 --> 00:00:55,998
Definitely.
Really?

29
00:00:56,037 --> 00:00:57,002
That's it.
No.

30
00:00:57,035 --> 00:00:58,442
That's it.

I'm such a girl.

47

My only note is more teeth.

48
00:02:13,102 --> 00:02:14,835
Can I be honest?

49
00:02:14,857 --> 00:02:16,506
This song is about
sexual awakening,

50
00:02:16,535 --> 00:02:18,832
as is the entire musical.

51
00:02:18,862 --> 00:02:21,325
You two lack passion.

52
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:24,347
Have either of you two
actually...?

53
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:27,373
Wow, okay. I have to go.
Because I have...

54
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,131
Those footballs aren't going
to inflate themselves.

55
00:02:29,165 --> 00:02:30,682
I'm out of here.
Let's go.

56
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:33,254
Look, I remember my
first time with Brittany.

57
00:02:33,288 --> 00:02:35,774
The excitement, the way it
made me feel like a man...

58
00:02:35,776 --> 00:02:39,230
even though she called me
the wrong name like four times,

59
00:02:39,276 --> 00:02:40,718
during and after.

60
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:42,353
What was it like for you guys?

61
00:02:44,905 --> 00:02:46,787
Um...

62
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,669
I'm, I'm waiting
for the right time.

63
00:02:48,703 --> 00:02:50,106
Yeah. Yeah, me-me, too.

64

I'm so glad that
you're my Tony.

65

Look...

66
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,295
as your friend I support
your strange aversion to fun.

67
00:02:55,297 --> 00:02:57,371
But as your director,
I'm concerned.

68
00:02:57,404 --> 00:02:58,785
I'm, I'm sorry,
what do you mean?

69
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:00,372
Well, how do you expect
to convey

70
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,985
the human perience
to an audience

71
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:04,506
when you haven't even opened
yourself up to one of humanity's

72
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,235

you still haven't told me
who you're ving for yet.

79

Well, I haven't decided.
Kurt's my brother.

80
00:03:28,492 --> 00:03:29,884
It's kind of hard to vote
against your brother.

81
00:03:29,903 --> 00:03:31,774
Well, I mean, you can't do
this with your brother.

82
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:39,895
Not unless you
live in Kentucky.

83

What's gotten into you?

84
00:03:41,827 --> 00:03:44,325
Nothing. It's just the
confidence of success.

85
00:03:44,374 --> 00:03:46,369
I mean, I sold out
the April Rhodes Auditorium

86
00:03:46,403 --> 00:03:48,928
for three shows, Jacob Ben
Israel's poll have me in tied

88

and I have
the hottest guy in school.

89
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,383
I hope that my radiance
isn't too much for you.

90
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:56,464
It won't be after Friday night.
What's Friday night?

91
00:03:56,521 --> 00:03:57,847
That is the day
that the recruiter

92
00:03:57,883 --> 00:03:59,227
from Ohio State is coming.

93
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:00,290
They're looking for
a new quarterback.

94
00:04:00,475 --> 00:04:02,212
Really?
That's amazing!

95
00:04:02,246 --> 00:04:04,646
Yeah, I know.
You... you're not pissed?

96
00:04:04,697 --> 00:04:06,477
No. No, of course not.

97
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:10,290
It's not like NYADA
has a football team.

98
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,027
It's really happening.

99
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:15,364
You know, our dreams are coming
true, and we're growing up.

100
00:04:15,398 --> 00:04:17,026
I know.

101
00:04:17,028 --> 00:04:18,729
And... hey,
I was thinking.

102
00:04:18,778 --> 00:04:22,323
Um, Burt and my mom are
out canvassing all week

103
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,743
and I have the house to myself.

104
00:04:25,551 --> 00:04:26,689
Maybe you could come over.

105
00:04:26,691 --> 00:04:28,854
To your house?

106
00:04:32,602 --> 00:04:33,863
I'll be there at 6:00.

107
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,511
Oh, boy.

108
00:04:51,138 --> 00:04:52,559
(Roxy Music plays loudly)

109
00:04:52,608 --> 00:04:54,690
God. Roxy Music makes me
want to build

110
00:04:54,726 --> 00:04:56,891
a time machine just so
I can go back to the '70s

111
00:04:56,949 --> 00:04:58,615
and give Brian Ferry
a high five.

112
00:04:58,648 --> 00:05:00,603
Do you think I'm boring?
Are you crazy?

113
00:05:00,652 --> 00:05:02,649
You're the single
most interesting kid

114
00:05:02,683 --> 00:05:05,358
in all of Ohio.
I mean, like...

115
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:06,902
sexually.

116
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:08,579
I mean, we are playing
it very safe by

117
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:11,080
not granting our hands visas
to travel south of the equator.

118
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:13,211
Oh, I-I thought
that's what we wanted.

119
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,252
It is.
I'm just wondering,

120
00:05:15,285 --> 00:05:16,742
have you ever had
the urge just to

121
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:18,322
rip off each other's clothes
and get dirty?

122
00:05:18,356 --> 00:05:21,214
Uh, yeah. But that's why
they invented masturbation.

123
00:05:21,251 --> 00:05:23,578
It's so hot in this room. Could
we, could we open up a window?

124
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:27,199
Hey, I'm serious. We're young.
We're in high school.

125
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,706
Yeah, we have urges, but

126
00:05:29,718 --> 00:05:34,342
whatever we do, I want to make
sure that you're comfortable.

127
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,642
So I can be comfortable.

128
00:05:36,974 --> 00:05:38,389
And besides,

129
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:41,732
tearing off all of your clothes
is sort of a tall order.

130
00:05:41,768 --> 00:05:43,018
Because of the layers?

131
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:45,398
Because of the layers.

132
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,701
Man, I love to weld.

133
00:05:52,735 --> 00:05:55,216
Clearly.
Coach, I'm concerned.

134
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,138
Why did you run out of
rehearsal the other day

135
00:05:57,178 --> 00:05:58,370
when we started
talking about S-E-X?

136
00:05:58,404 --> 00:06:00,574
Artie, this conversation
is totally inappropriate.

137
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:02,588
Wait.

138
00:06:05,008 --> 00:06:07,129
Have you never...?

139
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,723
Why? Have you just never
found the right...

140
00:06:08,757 --> 00:06:10,709
person?
Guy. I like guys.

141
00:06:10,743 --> 00:06:13,145
And no, I haven't found him.

142
00:06:14,405 --> 00:06:16,516
All right, I'll play.

143
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:18,862
There's this
one gentleman.

144
00:06:18,896 --> 00:06:20,416
He's the bee's knees.

145
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:22,871
His name's Cooter Mankins.

146
00:06:22,905 --> 00:06:24,982
He's a recruiter
for Ohio State.

147
00:06:25,035 --> 00:06:28,480
<i>He's beautiful. He makes me
feel like a girl...</i>

148
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:29,798
<i>but he's not interested.</i>

149
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,775
You're a hell of a coach, Coach.
So much talent.

150
00:06:33,948 --> 00:06:35,542
I'm famished.
Want to go get some lunch?

151
00:06:35,587 --> 00:06:36,866
Nah.

152
00:06:36,903 --> 00:06:38,878
But you can have
the rest of my chili.

153
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,215
There's nothing left but
gristle and a few beans,

154
00:06:41,256 --> 00:06:42,827
but it eats pretty good.

155
00:06:42,871 --> 00:06:46,084
So, anyway, that's my type.

156
00:06:46,118 --> 00:06:47,509
Not that it matters.

157

00:07:53,488 --> 00:07:57,904
¶ You knoI can't afford
to buy her pearls ¶

176
00:07:57,948 --> 00:08:01,817
¶ But maybe someday
when my ship comes in ¶

177
00:08:01,851 --> 00:08:05,326
¶ She'll understand
what kind of guy I've been ¶

178
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,167
¶ And then I'll win ¶

179
00:08:07,201 --> 00:08:09,993
¶ And when she's walking ¶

180
00:08:10,027 --> 00:08:15,173
¶ She's looking so fine ¶

181
00:08:15,207 --> 00:08:17,667
¶ And when she's talking ¶

182
00:08:17,701 --> 00:08:21,676
¶ She'll say that she's mine ¶

183
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,678
¶ She'll say I'm not so tough ¶

184
00:08:25,712 --> 00:08:29,100
¶ Just because I'm in love ¶

186
00:08:32,047 --> 00:08:34,901
¶ She's been living in her
white bread world ¶

187
00:08:34,938 --> 00:08:38,864
¶ As long as anyone
with hot blood can ¶

188
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:42,690
¶ And now she's looking
for a downtown man ¶

189
00:08:42,724 --> 00:08:45,326
¶ That's what I am ¶

190
00:08:45,362 --> 00:08:47,340
¶ Oh-oh-oh-oh... ¶

191
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:01,092
¶ Uptown girl ¶

192
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:04,471
¶ She's my uptown girl ¶

193
00:09:04,515 --> 00:09:06,468
¶ Don't you know I'm in love ¶

(laughs)

200
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,235
You guys killed it, as always!

201
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:27,941
We'd sound so much better
with you back in the mix.

202
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:30,458
Is this your triumphant
return to Dalton? Please?

203
00:09:31,656 --> 00:09:33,166
Actually, I'm here
to invite you guys

204
00:09:33,216 --> 00:09:34,585
to my opening night
at McKinley.

205
00:09:34,619 --> 00:09:36,048
<i>West Side Story.</i>

206
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,061
I reserved a whole block of
tickets just for the Warblers.

207
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,721
It would mean the world to
me if you guys could come.

208
00:09:39,756 --> 00:09:42,348
We'll be there. Once a Warbler,
always a Warbler, right?

209
00:09:42,398 --> 00:09:46,138
(hooting, cheering)

210
00:09:46,535 --> 00:09:48,843
Blaine Anderson.
Sebastian Smythe.

211
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,424
Hi. Are you a freshman?

212
00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:53,577
Do I look like a freshman?

213
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:56,211
Uh...

214
00:09:56,212 --> 00:09:57,972
(bell tolling)
So you're a legend at Dalton.

215
00:09:58,002 --> 00:09:59,834
Well, I...

216
00:09:59,868 --> 00:10:01,306
Don't be modest.

217
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,647
I was like, "I don't know
who this Blaine guy is,

218
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:06,648
"but apparently he's sex on a
stick and sings like a dream.

219
00:10:06,682 --> 00:10:09,733
So... sucks that
I missed him."

220
00:10:10,918 --> 00:10:12,274
All right.

221
00:10:12,276 --> 00:10:15,049
Since I'm working to recreate
your meteoric ascent,

222
00:10:15,051 --> 00:10:17,289
I-I need to ask.

223
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,517
Why did you leave Dalton?

224
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:22,169
Were you bored with all
the preppies around here?

225
00:10:22,283 --> 00:10:25,276
Or is it that you broke
too many hearts to stay?

226
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:27,280
("A Boy Like That" begins)

227
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,416
¶ A boy like that,
who'd kill your brother ¶

228
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:35,626
¶ Forget that boy
and find another ¶

229
00:10:35,628 --> 00:10:37,369
¶ One of your own kind ¶

230
00:10:37,421 --> 00:10:39,844
¶ Stick to your own kind ¶

231
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,478
(laughs)

232
00:10:41,513 --> 00:10:42,974
Uh, it wasn't like that.

233
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,268
Let's just say that

234
00:10:44,316 --> 00:10:45,485
I miss Dalton every day,

235
00:10:45,487 --> 00:10:48,297
but McKinley is
where my heart is, now.

236
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,885
¶ A boy like that wants
one thing only ¶

237
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:54,895
¶ And when he's done,
he'll leave you lonely ¶

238
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:58,652
¶ He'll murder your love;
he murdered mine ¶

239
00:10:58,702 --> 00:11:00,109
¶ Just wait and see ¶

240
00:11:00,164 --> 00:11:01,227
¶ Just wait, Maria ¶

241
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:04,289
¶ Just wait and see ¶

242
00:11:04,318 --> 00:11:08,954
¶ Oh, no, Anita, no, Anita, no ¶

243
00:11:08,992 --> 00:11:11,749
¶ It isn't true, not for me ¶

244
00:11:11,783 --> 00:11:14,136
¶ It's true for you,
not for me ¶

245
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,842
¶ I hear your words,
and in my head ¶

246
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:19,096
¶ I know they're smart ¶

247
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,499
¶ But my heart, Anita ¶

248
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:25,310
¶ But my heart knows
they're wrong ¶

249
00:11:25,348 --> 00:11:27,851
¶ You should know better ¶

250
00:11:27,908 --> 00:11:31,027
¶ You were in love,
or so you said ¶

251
00:11:31,229 --> 00:11:36,594
¶ You should know better. ¶

252
00:11:36,628 --> 00:11:39,413
I have to go
to lacrosse practice,

253
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:42,036
but could we meet again?

254
00:11:42,075 --> 00:11:45,406
I could really use some more
insights from you, Blaine.

255
00:11:46,386 --> 00:11:49,133
You know, Warbler to Warbler.

256
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:51,103
Sure.

257
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:04,879
(bell ringing)

258
00:12:04,918 --> 00:12:06,990
Hey, dude, I got
a question for you.

259
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,009
I thought they were my sneakers.

260
00:12:08,038 --> 00:12:09,008
BOTH:
What?

261
00:12:09,033 --> 00:12:10,848
No, no, look, I figured since

262
00:12:10,877 --> 00:12:13,012
you have some more experience

263
00:12:13,046 --> 00:12:17,330
than I do, you could
recommend a brand of condom.

264
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:18,796
Are you cheating
on Rachel, dude?

265
00:12:18,814 --> 00:12:19,657
Because if you are,
that is not cool.

266
00:12:19,904 --> 00:12:20,700
And that's coming from me.

267
00:12:20,778 --> 00:12:22,541
No. I want to use them
with Rachel.

268
00:12:22,591 --> 00:12:25,213
Oh. I'm happy for you, dude,
and her.

269
00:12:25,271 --> 00:12:26,725
I always thought it would be me,

270
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:28,107
but secretly hoped
it'd be you.

271
00:12:28,136 --> 00:12:30,445
As for the condoms,
no idea... never used them.

272
00:12:30,476 --> 00:12:32,033
It's worked out
for me about 99% of the time.

273
00:12:32,071 --> 00:12:34,117
(blows whistle)
Gather round!

274
00:12:35,825 --> 00:12:38,478
You all know Cooter Mankins.
Best eye for talent

275
00:12:38,505 --> 00:12:39,730
in the country if you ask me.

276
00:12:39,765 --> 00:12:42,442
Which is why I spend so much
time with you, Coach.

277
00:12:42,486 --> 00:12:46,509
Hey, are those new
tube socks?

278
00:12:46,553 --> 00:12:49,688
I got a whole new six-pack
if you need to borrow a pair.

279
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,326
(clears throat)

280
00:12:51,372 --> 00:12:53,644
All right,

281
00:12:53,702 --> 00:12:58,786
this Friday night I will be in
the stands watching you play.

282
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,840
And I'm not looking for boys
to play for the Buckeyes.

283
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,323
I'm looking for men.

284
00:13:06,713 --> 00:13:08,676
(bell ringing)

285
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,632
If you see any of Rachel's
campaign posters

286
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,109
feel free to tear
them down.

287
00:13:13,141 --> 00:13:15,729
Do you think we're
too sheltered as artists?

288
00:13:15,731 --> 00:13:17,762
I'm serious.

289
00:13:17,822 --> 00:13:19,748
<i>West Side Story's all about

of your safe little world.

291
00:13:21,315 --> 00:13:23,900
Don't you want to wake up
every day and be adventurous?

292
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:26,020
Experience everything
in life you can?

293
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:28,299
Of course, it's why
I made a bucket list.

294
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:29,570
Okay, you ready for this?

295
00:13:29,571 --> 00:13:30,138
Okay.

296
00:13:30,182 --> 00:13:30,895
All right, here you go.

297
00:13:30,921 --> 00:13:33,411
Number 87: become CEO of Logo.

298
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,264
Of course.

299
00:13:34,308 --> 00:13:37,891
Number 63: lay a rose at the
birthplace of Noel Coward.

300
00:13:37,915 --> 00:13:38,822
Okay, number five.

301
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,120
All right, this one's
really embarrassing.

302
00:13:40,137 --> 00:13:41,290
I wrote this before
I met you.

303
00:13:41,325 --> 00:13:43,868
Have relations on a dewy meadow
of lilac

304
00:13:43,885 --> 00:13:45,583
with Taylor Lautner
before he gets fat.

305
00:13:46,845 --> 00:13:48,367
Oh, yeah, I know, it's stupid.

306
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,255
No, it's not. It's hot.

307
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:54,275
Well, anyway,
we're-we're young,

308
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:57,861
so we've got all the time in
the world to be adventurous.

309
00:13:57,862 --> 00:14:00,773
Don't you think now is the
time to be adventurous

310
00:14:01,096 --> 00:14:03,296
while we're still young?

311
00:14:10,486 --> 00:14:11,568
(bell ringing)

312
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,178
Excuse me, Mr. Cooter,

313
00:14:14,277 --> 00:14:15,649
I'm Artie Abrams.

314
00:14:15,684 --> 00:14:18,023
Could I see you in my office?
It's important.

315
00:14:18,035 --> 00:14:20,707
You don't mean the handicapped
stall, do you?

316
00:14:20,756 --> 00:14:23,549
Uh, no. But that is hilarious.

317
00:14:26,873 --> 00:14:28,902
Holy hell!

318
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,632
What is this, a movie
theatre or something?

319
00:14:30,681 --> 00:14:31,683
You like Coach Beiste, right?

320
00:14:31,715 --> 00:14:32,923
Yeah, yeah, of course I do.

321
00:14:32,929 --> 00:14:34,525
She's the best
football coach in the state.

322
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:36,951
Yeah, but do you like her,
like her?

323
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:45,033
You know, I've asked her out
about a million times.

324
00:14:45,168 --> 00:14:46,738
She's not interested.
Last week I told her

325
00:14:46,842 --> 00:14:48,770
I had a gift
certificate to Applebee's.

326
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:50,628
She told me fancy restaurants
make her nervous.

327
00:14:50,662 --> 00:14:51,625
You have to ask her out again.

328
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:54,068
No way, Andy.
She's gonna blow me off.

329
00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:55,230
Trust me.

330
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:58,235
You need to ask her out again,

331
00:14:58,304 --> 00:14:59,556
but make it really obvious.

332
00:15:01,028 --> 00:15:03,082
I have the perfect idea
for a date.

333
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:04,567
I can't believe you asked

334
00:15:04,591 --> 00:15:07,215
for a shot of Courvoisier
in your coffee.

335
00:15:07,244 --> 00:15:08,892
I forget how lame
this town is.

336
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:10,986
When I lived in Paris,

337
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:12,905
I drank it like it was
mother's milk.

338
00:15:12,939 --> 00:15:14,283
When...?

339
00:15:14,302 --> 00:15:15,617
Oh, okay, wow.

340
00:15:15,638 --> 00:15:16,183
What?

341
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:18,123
You're just so, you know,
you're out there.

342
00:15:18,154 --> 00:15:20,809
And your whole bashful
schoolboy thing?

343
00:15:20,843 --> 00:15:22,703
Super hot.

344
00:15:22,734 --> 00:15:25,398
Look, Sebastian,
I have a boyfriend.

345
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,050
Doesn't bother me
if it doesn't bother you.

346
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:29,565
No, I mean, I really care
about him.

347
00:15:29,593 --> 00:15:30,702
He doesn't need to know.

348
00:15:30,736 --> 00:15:32,081
I'd just never want to mess

349
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,477
my thing up with him in any way.

350
00:15:34,524 --> 00:15:36,194
He's really great.

351
00:15:36,225 --> 00:15:37,058
Who's really great?

352
00:15:37,092 --> 00:15:38,644
You!

353
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,537
We were just talking
about you.

354
00:15:40,568 --> 00:15:44,586
Sebastian, this is Kurt,
my boyfriend, who I was just...

355
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,641
Got it.
Wow. Wow.

356
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,399
Pleasure.

357
00:15:49,976 --> 00:15:52,089
And how do we know
Sebastian?

358
00:15:52,113 --> 00:15:53,337
We met at Dalton.

359
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:54,591
Was dying to meet Blaine.

360
00:15:54,624 --> 00:15:56,216
Those Warblers just won't
shut up about him.

361
00:15:56,277 --> 00:15:58,177
Didn't think he could
live up to the hype,

362
00:15:58,204 --> 00:15:59,950
but as it turns out...

363
00:15:59,983 --> 00:16:03,382
Yes, he's even more impressive
in the flesh.

364
00:16:03,413 --> 00:16:05,985
Hey, what are you guys doing
tomorrow night?

365
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:08,380
Well, we're rehearsing
for the school musical.

366
00:16:08,405 --> 00:16:09,853
And then, at bedtime,

367
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:12,340
we do a rigorous skin-sloughing
regimen over the phone together.

368
00:16:12,376 --> 00:16:15,174
And as sexy as that sounds,

369
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,121
what do you say
we shake things up?

370
00:16:17,152 --> 00:16:18,934
I get you guys
a couple of fake IDs

371
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,561
and we head over
to Scandals in West Lima.

372
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,270
Scandals?
That's the gay bar.

373
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:23,771
The last time
I was there,

374
00:16:23,793 --> 00:16:26,677
I met the man of my dreams on
the dance floor.

375
00:16:26,722 --> 00:16:27,651
That's so sweet.

376
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:28,916
And are you two
still together?

377
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,503
Sadly, no.

378
00:16:30,515 --> 00:16:32,676
We broke up about
20 minutes after we met.

379
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,091
Come on, guys.

380
00:16:34,122 --> 00:16:35,094
Live a little.

381
00:16:35,116 --> 00:16:36,699
We would love to,
Sebastian.

382
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:39,559
Thank you for the offer.
That's very nice of you,

383
00:16:39,613 --> 00:16:42,644
but that just isn't
our kind of thing.

384
00:16:42,646 --> 00:16:43,824
Let's do it.

385
00:16:43,858 --> 00:16:46,810
What? Yeah.
We have a whole bunch of firsts

386
00:16:46,836 --> 00:16:48,521
to start crossing
off our list.

387
00:16:48,555 --> 00:16:49,668
We're in.

388
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,027
Great.

389
00:16:51,062 --> 00:16:52,400
Great.

390
00:16:55,274 --> 00:16:57,626
(Rachel sighs)

391
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,544
That was amazing.

392
00:16:59,578 --> 00:17:02,152
I've never had
meat substitute before

393
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,548
that tastes that
much like real meat.

394
00:17:03,735 --> 00:17:05,659
Of course.
Because you're a vegan,

395
00:17:05,693 --> 00:17:07,554
which I remember because we know
each other so well.

396
00:17:07,604 --> 00:17:08,632
More sparking cider?

397
00:17:08,675 --> 00:17:10,790
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.

398
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,144
Should we make a toast?

399
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:13,158
Yeah.
All right.

400
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:17,348
To four full months
of no fighting

401
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,676
or threats of us breaking up.

402
00:17:19,678 --> 00:17:21,161
Nothing but love, love, love.

403
00:17:26,515 --> 00:17:27,959
BOTH:
Cheers.

404
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,676
Oh, should I go
make dessert?

405
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,029
I've got pound cake.
It's Sara Lee.

406
00:17:36,063 --> 00:17:39,761
Oh, actually I thought maybe we
could just go snuggle

407
00:17:39,763 --> 00:17:41,102
by the fire first.

408
00:17:44,788 --> 00:17:47,201
Okay.

409
00:18:06,864 --> 00:18:08,810
I brought protection.

410
00:18:08,812 --> 00:18:10,071
Me, too.

411
00:18:10,142 --> 00:18:11,483
Every modern girl
comes prepared.

412
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:17,919
Wait, wait.
Before we do this,

413
00:18:17,926 --> 00:18:20,762
I need to know, why now?

414
00:18:20,778 --> 00:18:23,118
The last time we talked
about this, you said

415
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,696
you wanted to wait
until you won a Tony.

416
00:18:24,735 --> 00:18:26,470
Or any other major award.
Emmy, Golden Globe.

417
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,293
People's Choice would have
gotten you to third base.

418
00:18:28,295 --> 00:18:29,758
But I don't know what changed.

419
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:32,101
I mean, even the thought

420
00:18:32,135 --> 00:18:33,980
of going to New York a virgin
felt silly to me.

421
00:18:34,107 --> 00:18:35,418
But when and who's gonna feel

422
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:36,912
more right than you and now?

423
00:18:36,914 --> 00:18:38,759
And I love you.

424
00:18:44,826 --> 00:18:47,219
I just want to make sure this is
special enough for you.

425
00:18:47,246 --> 00:18:48,531
I've been saving up
for a hotel for us.

426
00:18:48,664 --> 00:18:52,014
Someplace nice like a Marriot
or something.

427
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,606
If we wait a couple of weeks,
I could probably...

428
00:18:53,712 --> 00:18:55,049
No, I can't wait
a couple weeks.

429
00:18:55,104 --> 00:18:57,151
I have to get this done before
opening night.

430
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,568
Get this done?

431
00:18:59,614 --> 00:19:03,337
I can't play airl
who has a sexual awakening

432
00:19:03,363 --> 00:19:04,771
if I'm not woken up myself.

433
00:19:04,974 --> 00:19:08,198
So you're doing this
so you can act better?

434
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:11,045
No! No! I'm doing this
because I love you

435
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,126
<i>and so that I can act better.</i>

436
00:19:13,164 --> 00:19:14,414
But that's
my business, okay?

437
00:19:14,448 --> 00:19:17,979
It has nothing to do
with you, so...

438
00:19:18,002 --> 00:19:19,268
Where are you going?

439
00:19:19,302 --> 00:19:21,827
No, no, I'm-I'm ready.
Please come back.

440
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,210
I-I just need a minute.

441
00:19:24,389 --> 00:19:26,881
I'm gonna make dessert.

442
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:43,900
When were you
gonna tell me?

443
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:46,200
- Tell you what?
- That you're doing the school musical.

444
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,638
I overheard your mother
talking about it on the phone.

445
00:19:48,672 --> 00:19:51,292
You lied to me, and you made
a liar out of your mother.

446
00:19:51,326 --> 00:19:53,425
You will quit immediately.

447
00:19:53,466 --> 00:19:55,806
No!
I love being a dancer.

448
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,859
When I was in high school
I wanted to be a tennis player,

449
00:19:58,861 --> 00:20:00,647
but then I had to wake up
and realize that

450
00:20:00,681 --> 00:20:01,774
I wasn't good enough.

451
00:20:01,828 --> 00:20:03,129
Grow up, Michael!

452
00:20:03,163 --> 00:20:04,917
You need to learn the difference

453
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,530
between grown-up dreams
and kid dreams.

454
00:20:06,564 --> 00:20:08,763
I'm not going to be a doctor.

455
00:20:10,173 --> 00:20:12,341
I will be a professional dancer.

456
00:20:12,366 --> 00:20:14,325
I'll pay my own way
through college.

457
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:15,617
I don't want your money.

458
00:20:15,642 --> 00:20:17,695
As long as you continue
to waste your life

459
00:20:17,729 --> 00:20:19,407
with this silly fantasy,

460
00:20:20,841 --> 00:20:23,850
you will no longer be my son.

461
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,972
Then I guess I don't have
a dad anymore.

462
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:40,642
(bell ringing)

463
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,250
Need somebody to spot you?

464
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,711
No, I'm good.

465
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,212
I lift big and solo.

466
00:20:47,254 --> 00:20:49,218
You'd be surprised how much
I could bench.

467
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,875
If I got the chance.

468
00:20:50,927 --> 00:20:52,215
Gotcha.

469
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:54,711
I'll be through
here in a sec,

470
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,982
and then
they're all yours.

471
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,792
Did you need me for something?

472
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:02,958
Yeah. Yeah, I do. I, uh...

473
00:21:03,642 --> 00:21:05,146
I got these.

474
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,689
Are you going to a graveyard?

475
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,753
No, no, I got them for you.
I'm not sick.

476
00:21:08,807 --> 00:21:11,227
Dang it, Shannon, can you just,
can you drop the weights,

477
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,393
please,
and talk to me for a second?

478
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:22,362
Man, you ever just have
something

479
00:21:22,396 --> 00:21:23,924
you really wanted to get out,

480
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,820
and you just
couldn't seem to do it?

481
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:28,357
I had a chigger in
my thigh once.

482
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:30,325
It was the size of a Tic Tac.

483
00:21:30,448 --> 00:21:32,827
I want to take you out
on a date.

484
00:21:32,889 --> 00:21:36,255
A real honest-to-God sit-down
date where you dress up

485
00:21:36,368 --> 00:21:39,087
like a lady and I dress up
like a gentleman.

486
00:21:39,117 --> 00:21:42,584
Yes or no?

487
00:21:42,773 --> 00:21:44,709
Why are you doing this, Cooter?

488
00:21:46,231 --> 00:21:47,422
Somebody put you up to this?

489
00:21:47,446 --> 00:21:50,135
Geez.

490
00:21:50,255 --> 00:21:52,450
Why don't you get
that I'm attracted to you?

491
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:53,972
Because you're the kind of man

492
00:21:54,042 --> 00:21:56,363
that could have any pretty girl
he pointed at,

493
00:21:56,365 --> 00:22:01,637
and I don't look the way
pretty girls look.

494
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,726
Well, good...

495
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,626
'cause I don't date girls.

496
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,388
I just date women.

497
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,107
Beautiful women.
Like you.

498
00:22:15,271 --> 00:22:17,151
So, take the flowers.

499
00:22:17,329 --> 00:22:19,139
Go on.

500
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,001
(sighs)

501
00:22:24,951 --> 00:22:27,584
So, Friday...

502
00:22:27,618 --> 00:22:28,822
after the game.

503
00:22:30,271 --> 00:22:31,807
(door opens)

504
00:22:31,822 --> 00:22:33,398
(sniffles)

505
00:22:36,983 --> 00:22:38,603
This emergency meeting is now in
session.

506
00:22:38,637 --> 00:22:40,234
Now I realize that we are a
house divided,

507
00:22:40,272 --> 00:22:41,614
but I need the advice
of my girls.

508
00:22:41,648 --> 00:22:43,914
The last time I called a meeting
like thiwas during

509
00:22:43,948 --> 00:22:46,496
our Madonna lesson, and all of
you were wildly unhelpful.

510
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:48,914
But it's been two years now,
and we've all grown up,

511
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:50,424
so I'm optimistic.

512
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:54,247
Finn and I were...
almost intimate.

513
00:22:54,294 --> 00:22:56,162
Almost? What happened?
He ran out.

514
00:22:56,196 --> 00:22:57,964
I just... I wanted my
performance of Maria

515
00:22:57,998 --> 00:23:00,176
to be as realistic as possible
and when he found out that

516
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,689
that's why I was doing it,
he got really, really hurt.

517
00:23:02,722 --> 00:23:04,620
Of course he was hurt.
Yeah, that's really bad, Rachel.

518
00:23:04,654 --> 00:23:07,630
I know. I know. I feel terribl
And now I realize that I was

519
00:23:07,664 --> 00:23:09,486
just doing it for
all the wrong reasons.

520
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,050
Do you want my advice?

521
00:23:11,084 --> 00:23:12,650
Just wait.
Just wait?

522
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:15,351
Look what happened to me.
You could've used protection.

523
00:23:15,385 --> 00:23:17,411
I'm not just talking about
getting pregnant, I'm-I'm

524
00:23:17,608 --> 00:23:20,693
talking about losing something
that you can never get back.

525
00:23:20,695 --> 00:23:23,715
It changes you.
It makes everything more complicated.

526
00:23:23,731 --> 00:23:26,043
I also think that
you should wait.

527
00:23:26,045 --> 00:23:28,751
Speaking from experience,
Finn is terrible in bed.

528
00:23:28,785 --> 00:23:30,441
Santana, that is not cool.
Oh, what?

529
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:33,560
If Rachel wants my sloppy seconds,
she should at least know the truth.

530
00:23:33,562 --> 00:23:35,889
Look, it was like being
smothered by a sweaty,

531
00:23:35,923 --> 00:23:37,497
out-of-breath sack of potatoes

532
00:23:37,531 --> 00:23:38,769
that someone soaked
in body spray.

533
00:23:38,933 --> 00:23:40,712
I lost my virginity at
cheerleading camp.

534
00:23:40,716 --> 00:23:43,719
He just climbed into my tent.
Alien invasion.

535
00:23:43,828 --> 00:23:46,213
Okay, well, then I guess
it's settled.

536
00:23:46,231 --> 00:23:49,041
Obviously, things are heating up
between Finn and I.

537
00:23:49,064 --> 00:23:51,415
But I think we should wait.

538
00:23:51,449 --> 00:23:55,423
Losing my virginity was a great
experience for me...

539
00:23:55,457 --> 00:23:57,183
because I was with
someone I love.

540
00:23:57,217 --> 00:24:02,090
¶ I have a love ¶

541
00:24:02,212 --> 00:24:06,900
¶ And it's all that I have ¶

542
00:24:06,924 --> 00:24:09,727
¶ Right or wrong, what else ¶

543
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,724
¶ Can I do? ¶

544
00:24:11,747 --> 00:24:13,198
<i>TINA:
It happened this summer.</i>

545
00:24:13,232 --> 00:24:15,236
Mike and I had talked
about it for awhile,

546
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:17,208
because we knew that
the first time was gonna be

547
00:24:17,242 --> 00:24:18,427
something we'd want
to remember forever.

548
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:21,079
¶ I love him ¶

549
00:24:21,114 --> 00:24:24,438
¶ I'm his ¶

550
00:24:24,474 --> 00:24:28,932
¶ And everything he is ¶

551
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,181
¶ I am, too... ¶

552
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,100
And when that
moment came...

553
00:24:34,102 --> 00:24:35,620
we just knew.

554
00:24:35,802 --> 00:24:36,985
It was right.

555
00:24:37,157 --> 00:24:39,163
It wasn't rushed.

556
00:24:39,193 --> 00:24:40,564
It was amazing.

557
00:24:40,598 --> 00:24:47,439
RACHEL AND SANTANA:
¶ When love comes so strong ¶

558
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:53,456
¶ There is no right or wrong ¶

559
00:24:53,489 --> 00:24:57,957
¶ Your love is... ¶

560
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,806
He's my first love.

561
00:24:59,848 --> 00:25:01,961
And I'll always look back at
that moment as

562
00:25:02,077 --> 00:25:05,767
absolutely perfect...
no regrets.

563
00:25:05,801 --> 00:25:10,009

This doesn't even
look like me.

00:25:28,852 --> 00:25:30,667
Don't worry.
Mine says I'm 38.

567
00:25:30,788 --> 00:25:33,006

Okay.

Aloha!

570
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:46,399
Enjoy.

571
00:25:46,469 --> 00:25:48,683
It's Drag Queen Wednesday.

572
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,743
Great.

573
00:25:53,871 --> 00:25:56,558
It's not very scandalous...

574
00:25:56,604 --> 00:25:58,297
Au contraire.

575
00:25:58,335 --> 00:26:00,325
Look at all the, uh,
glamorous drag queens.

576
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:04,534
Look, there's uh, Cher and
Tina Turner and, uh, uh...

577
00:26:04,536 --> 00:26:06,754
is that Lucy or Reba?

KURT:
Of course.

580
00:26:13,224 --> 00:26:16,591
¶ Then I say "I love you"
and foul the situation... ¶

581
00:26:16,654 --> 00:26:17,806
I really don't
like that guy.

582
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,872
He's harmless.

583
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,892
A beer for Blaine,

584
00:26:21,911 --> 00:26:25,155
and for Kurt, a Shirley Temple
with extra cherries.

585
00:26:25,224 --> 00:26:27,152
I heard you're the
designated driver.

586
00:26:27,189 --> 00:26:28,329
Like, all the time.

587
00:26:28,363 --> 00:26:29,826
Cheers, boys.

588
00:26:29,894 --> 00:26:31,995

¶ I care enough to know I can
never love you ¶

¶ Who broke my heart?
You did, you did... ¶

592
00:26:45,846 --> 00:26:48,052
You better watch
your boyfriend.

593
00:26:48,086 --> 00:26:50,037
Could I get another
beer, please?

(Thelma Houston's "Don't Leave
Me This Way" plays)

00:26:53,693 --> 00:26:55,585
So, how's life
at your new school?

596
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:58,682
Fine.

597
00:27:00,884 --> 00:27:03,621
Look, I just want to have a
normal senior year and play

598
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,987
football without my teammates
hearing rumors about me.

599
00:27:06,051 --> 00:27:09,604
Just so that you know, I would
have never told anyone.

600
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,532
It's not who I am.

601
00:27:14,069 --> 00:27:16,700
So, you come here
all the time?

602
00:27:16,743 --> 00:27:21,259
People like me here.
I feel accepted.

603
00:27:21,293 --> 00:27:23,179
I'm what they call a bear cub.

604
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,603
Because you look like Yogi?

605
00:27:24,637 --> 00:27:27,621
I don't know, because
I'm burly or something.

606
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,436
So... so is this the point
where you judge me?

607
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:37,327
No, as long as you're not
beating people up, I am all for

608
00:27:37,345 --> 00:27:39,974
being whoever you have to
be at your own speed.

¶ Oh, baby,
don't leave me this way ¶

Baby steps. ¶

¶ Don't leave me this way ¶

¶ Baby, my heart is full of love
and desire for you ¶

617
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:09,838
¶ Now come on down and do what
you gotta do ¶

618
00:28:09,876 --> 00:28:14,010
¶ You started this fire down in
my soul ¶

619

out of control? ¶

Okay. All right.
It's the best night of my life.

622
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,348
I want to live here.
I want to live here.

623
00:28:22,387 --> 00:28:23,889
And I just want to make art

624
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,505
and you know, just help people.

625
00:28:25,525 --> 00:28:28,513
(laughs) You could certainly help
people make fires with your breath.

626
00:28:28,521 --> 00:28:30,283
Hey, come on,
I only h one beer.

627
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:31,277
Sure, you did.
Hey.

628
00:28:31,316 --> 00:28:32,275
What?
Kiss me. Kiss me.

629
00:28:32,317 --> 00:28:33,789
Oh, no, no, no, no...
Come on...

630
00:28:33,815 --> 00:28:35,695
Come on, you're riding
in the back. Come on.

631
00:28:35,738 --> 00:28:36,906
Lay down.
All right, all right.

632
00:28:36,956 --> 00:28:38,112
You're less likely to
throw up that way.

633
00:28:38,152 --> 00:28:39,283
Get in there.

634
00:28:39,324 --> 00:28:40,790
Whoa, wait! Okay...
(stammering)

635
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:43,150
All right, Blaine, all right.
Cold hand, cold hand!

636
00:28:43,184 --> 00:28:44,403
Come on, come on.
Hey, Kurt, let's just do it.

637
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:45,794
I... I want you.
No, no...

638
00:28:45,837 --> 00:28:48,525
I want you so...
No, Blaine, no, just... Stop it...

639
00:28:48,548 --> 00:28:51,427
Hey, listen, I-I know you wanted
to do it in a field of lilacs

640
00:28:51,466 --> 00:28:54,007
with Sting playing in the background and
all that, but who cares where we are?

641
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:56,344
It's all about us, right?
Right, it's about us.

642
00:28:56,378 --> 00:28:58,346
Which is why I don't want
to do it on a night

643
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,215
that you spent half of
dancing with another guy

644
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:02,374
and that you're sober enough
to remember it the next day!

645
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:05,878
Why are you yelling at me? Because I have never
felt less like being intimate with someone

646
00:29:05,904 --> 00:29:08,317
and either you can't tell
or you just don't care.

647
00:29:08,358 --> 00:29:09,844
(sighs)

648
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,040
Where are you going?

649
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:14,720
I'm sorry if I'm trying to
be spontaneous and fun.

650
00:29:19,201 --> 00:29:21,411
I think I'm just
gonna walk home.

651
00:29:22,832 --> 00:29:23,563
Blaine!

652
00:29:25,069 --> 00:29:26,779
(sighs):
God!

653
00:29:39,184 --> 00:29:41,749
(audience murmuring)

654
00:29:45,065 --> 00:29:47,502
Just so you know, your
Maria has disappointed you.

655
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:49,438
I'm still a virgin.

656
00:29:50,728 --> 00:29:52,892
And your Tony has
disappointed you.

657
00:29:52,901 --> 00:29:54,437
- Me, too.
- Look, the audience is smart.

658
00:29:54,472 --> 00:29:57,232
The only sensible solution is to
just cancel the show.

659
00:29:57,242 --> 00:30:00,560
I'd rather send everybody home than
give a false, inauthentic performance.

660
00:30:00,562 --> 00:30:02,167
Five minutes!

661
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:05,729
Rachel, darken your eyebrows.
Blaine, tone down the blush.

662
00:30:05,744 --> 00:30:07,907
My eyebrows are fine.

663
00:30:20,765 --> 00:30:23,704
Artie? Artie, are you okay?
You look upset.

664
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,255
Everything is wrong.

665
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:27,245
The scenery, the costumes,
the staging.

666
00:30:27,256 --> 00:30:29,240
You know, I thought if I just
pretended like I knew

667
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:31,012
what I was doing I could lie my
way through it,

668
00:30:31,066 --> 00:30:32,906
but in five minutes that curtain
is going to go up

669
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,612
and everybody is going to know
that I'm a fraud.

670
00:30:35,614 --> 00:30:37,575
Artie, you were brilliant.

671
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:40,714
Really, this show is absolutely amazing,
and that is all thanks to you.

672
00:30:40,917 --> 00:30:44,702
It's awful.
I let everybody down.

673
00:30:44,722 --> 00:30:46,944
Hey, Artie, some of the cast needs
to talk to you before we go on.

674
00:30:48,572 --> 00:30:50,275
See? It's mutiny.

675
00:30:50,311 --> 00:30:52,444
Dude, we have a problem.

676
00:30:52,491 --> 00:30:56,478
We haven't officially thanked you for
everything that you've done for us.

677
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:06,122
All of us were so nervous, and we
didn't know what we were doing

678
00:31:06,143 --> 00:31:09,841
and you were like the lighthouse
that lead us to the way.

679
00:31:09,903 --> 00:31:11,713
But I didn't know what I was
doing, either.

680
00:31:11,715 --> 00:31:16,817
When you're in a chair,
it hard to...

681
00:31:18,587 --> 00:31:20,424
ever feel
like you've grown up.

682
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:24,195
Everyone's always doing stuff
for you,

683
00:31:24,237 --> 00:31:26,339
they get freaked out about
saying the wrong thing,

684
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,222
so... they coddle you.

685
00:31:29,266 --> 00:31:30,686
Sometimes it's hard to ever
picture a life

686
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,422
of being totally
self-sufficient.

687
00:31:33,439 --> 00:31:35,890
But directing you ys,

688
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:38,233
the way you trusted me,

689
00:31:38,283 --> 00:31:42,582
the way you looked at me
and listened to me,

690
00:31:42,635 --> 00:31:44,627
it was the first time in my life
that I ever...

691
00:31:44,661 --> 00:31:47,007
felt like a grown man.

692
00:31:48,293 --> 00:31:51,486
That's the greatest gift
you can give a guy, so...

693
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,155
So, thank you guys...

694
00:31:54,171 --> 00:31:57,668
for the flowers and for
everything.

695
00:31:57,678 --> 00:31:58,917
All right, show circle.

696
00:31:58,956 --> 00:32:00,151
(relieved laughter)

697
00:32:00,172 --> 00:32:01,322
May I, chief?

698
00:32:01,344 --> 00:32:03,920
Let's kick some ass!

699
00:32:04,031 --> 00:32:05,709
(collective cheer)

700
00:32:12,511 --> 00:32:15,524
When I think about how we came
to America!

701
00:32:15,557 --> 00:32:17,778
Like children! Believing!
Trusting!

702
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,338
Ah, trusting with our hearts
open...

703
00:32:20,347 --> 00:32:21,679
With our arms open...

704
00:32:21,715 --> 00:32:23,387
(Irish accent): You
came with your mouth open.

705
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,303
We gotta work on this
kid's diction.

706
00:32:26,337 --> 00:32:29,660
Without a doubt, the best
musical McKinley's ever done.

707
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:32,306
We'll see. It's a risky artistic
choice weaving the Jets

708
00:32:32,308 --> 00:32:34,143
into "America,"
but Artie insisted.

709
00:32:34,177 --> 00:32:36,034
(Latin music plays)

710
00:32:36,065 --> 00:32:38,644
I just hope that people go with
it, you know?

711
00:32:38,678 --> 00:32:42,154
¶ Puerto Rico ¶

712
00:32:42,188 --> 00:32:45,319

¶ Always the hurricanes
blowing ¶

00:32:56,327 --> 00:33:01,500
¶ Always
the population growing ¶

717
00:33:01,534 --> 00:33:04,215
¶ And the money owing ¶

718
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:07,544
¶ And the sunlight streaming ¶

719
00:33:07,556 --> 00:33:10,222
¶ And the natives steaming ¶

720
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:13,843
¶ I like the island Manhattan ¶

721
00:33:13,877 --> 00:33:15,012
I know you do!

722

¶ Smoke on your pipe ¶

723
00:33:17,979 --> 00:33:20,715
¶ And put that in ¶

¶ Everything free in America ¶

727

(all shout)

728
00:33:37,275 --> 00:33:40,033
¶ Lots of new housing
with more space ¶

729
00:33:40,067 --> 00:33:44,085
¶ Lots of doors slamming
in our face ¶

730
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:46,455
¶ I'll get
a terrace apartmt ¶

731
00:33:46,502 --> 00:33:49,285

00:33:56,907 --> 00:34:00,466
¶ If you're all-white

736
00:34:03,963 --> 00:34:06,352

00:34:06,382 --> 00:34:08,417
¶ La-la, la-la-la,
America ¶

738
00:34:08,436 --> 00:34:10,639
¶ La-la, la-la-la, America ¶

739
00:34:11,471 --> 00:34:13,780
¶ America! ¶

00:34:17,228 --> 00:34:19,761

¶ I like to be in America ¶

¶ Okay by me in America ¶

750
00:34:42,464 --> 00:34:45,124
¶ Everything free in America ¶

751
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:47,000
¶ For a small fee in America ¶

752
00:34:47,049 --> 00:34:49,119
¶ La-la, la-la-la, America ¶

753

756
00:34:57,793 --> 00:35:02,486
(cheering, shouting)

757
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:19,669
How are we, as virgins,
supposed to follow that?

758
00:35:21,676 --> 00:35:24,324
Tony and Maria
were soul mates, okay?

759
00:35:24,342 --> 00:35:27,334
Against all odds,
they found each other.

760
00:35:27,382 --> 00:35:29,656
I know what that's like.

761
00:35:29,672 --> 00:35:31,282
And you do, too.

762
00:35:32,707 --> 00:35:35,104
So we just have
to play that, okay?

763
00:35:35,147 --> 00:35:36,487
We, as actors,

764
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,722
have to tap into that.

765
00:35:39,427 --> 00:35:41,268
Okay?

766
00:35:53,221 --> 00:35:56,107
(quiet whooshing)

767
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,524
Shouldn't you be celebrating?

768
00:36:02,224 --> 00:36:03,809
I'm going over this move.

769
00:36:03,863 --> 00:36:05,051
I messed it up tonight.

770
00:36:05,085 --> 00:36:06,555
I know I can do it better.

771
00:36:06,589 --> 00:36:08,527
Beauty of the stage...

772
00:36:08,575 --> 00:36:10,527
we get to do it all over again
tomorrow night.

773
00:36:12,927 --> 00:36:14,091
Personally, I thought both of
you guys were perfect.

774
00:36:14,114 --> 00:36:16,208
Thank you.

775
00:36:16,327 --> 00:36:17,781
Your Officer Krupke killed.

776
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,718
Brought the house down.

777
00:36:19,755 --> 00:36:22,133
Well, I can't help
but pull focus, sorry.

778
00:36:22,135 --> 00:36:23,451
Don't apologize.

779
00:36:23,486 --> 00:36:25,488
It was great.

780
00:36:27,023 --> 00:36:29,804
All your friends
were here tonight.

781
00:36:29,806 --> 00:36:31,647
The Warblers...
Sebastian...

782
00:36:33,501 --> 00:36:35,972
They were all loving it.

783
00:36:35,974 --> 00:36:37,818
Come here.

784
00:36:37,848 --> 00:36:40,234
Give me your hand.

785
00:36:41,985 --> 00:36:43,515
Hold it to your heart.

786
00:36:43,558 --> 00:36:45,967
Just like the song?
Like the song.

787
00:36:47,018 --> 00:36:49,478
Kurt...

788
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:53,313
Sebastian doesn't mean
anything to me.

789
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,653
And you were right...

790
00:36:56,661 --> 00:36:58,873
our first time
shouldn't be like that.

791
00:36:58,987 --> 00:37:03,133
I was drunk and... I'm sorry.

792
00:37:03,167 --> 00:37:05,164
Well, sure beats the
last time you were drunk

793
00:37:05,204 --> 00:37:06,375
and made out with Rachel.

794
00:37:06,428 --> 00:37:07,790
(sighs)

795
00:37:07,824 --> 00:37:09,865
(both laughing)

796
00:37:09,925 --> 00:37:11,974
But I'm sorry, too.

797
00:37:12,008 --> 00:37:14,338
I wanted to be your
gay bar superstar but...

798
00:37:14,379 --> 00:37:18,679
try as I might, I'm still
just a silly romantic.

799
00:37:18,865 --> 00:37:20,994
It's not silly.

800
00:37:24,502 --> 00:37:26,298
You take my breath away.

801
00:37:26,332 --> 00:37:28,524
Not just now;
tonight on that stage.

802
00:37:28,564 --> 00:37:30,226
I was so proud
to be with you.

803
00:37:30,273 --> 00:37:32,190
I hope so.

804
00:37:33,398 --> 00:37:35,545
I want you to be.

805
00:37:39,204 --> 00:37:42,977
Um... Artie's having
an after party at Breadstix.

806
00:37:42,996 --> 00:37:45,840
Would you... accompany me?

807
00:37:45,874 --> 00:37:48,050
No.

808
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,774
I want to go to your house.

809
00:37:50,814 --> 00:37:53,089
Okay.

810
00:37:53,144 --> 00:37:55,714
(dogs barking in distance)

811
00:38:00,031 --> 00:38:01,472
(knocking)

812
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,167
Hi.

813
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:10,254
I got your flowers.

814
00:38:11,733 --> 00:38:13,303
They were beautiful.

815
00:38:13,305 --> 00:38:14,749
You were really good.

816
00:38:16,178 --> 00:38:17,103
Can I come in?

817
00:38:17,138 --> 00:38:18,741
Yeah.

818
00:38:24,562 --> 00:38:26,029
Where is everybody?

819
00:38:26,063 --> 00:38:27,615
Kurt's out with Blaine,

820
00:38:27,685 --> 00:38:30,455
and Burt and Carole left
for Toledo right after the show.

821
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,006
They got some kind of
meet-and-greet in the morning,

822
00:38:32,048 --> 00:38:34,096
so... spending the night.

823
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:39,081
Why didn't you stay for
the after party?

824
00:38:39,203 --> 00:38:41,575
I mean, I know that you're still
mad at me abouthe other night.

825
00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:43,220
He didn't like me.

826
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:45,489
What? Who?

827
00:38:45,542 --> 00:38:47,227
The recruiter.

828
00:38:47,261 --> 00:38:48,836
<i>He watched the game and then</i>

829
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:50,388
<i>I waited like an idiot
for 20 minutes</i>

830
00:38:50,422 --> 00:38:52,622
<i>while he talked to Shane.</i>

831
00:38:52,624 --> 00:38:54,400
<i>I didn't even shower
or change out of my uniform,</i>

832
00:38:54,434 --> 00:38:55,944
<i>because I was afraid
I'd miss him.</i>

833
00:38:58,194 --> 00:39:01,175
So you guys
are going after Shane?

834
00:39:01,209 --> 00:39:02,429
Kid's a monster.

835
00:39:03,696 --> 00:39:05,122
Look, kid,

836
00:39:05,154 --> 00:39:07,348
just 'cause your football career
ends in high school,

837
00:39:07,397 --> 00:39:09,991
it doesn't mean
your life does.

838
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:11,938
Wait... I don't,
I don't understand

839
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:14,152
what any of this means.
It means I suck!

840
00:39:14,187 --> 00:39:16,650
It means I'm gonna
be stuck here forever.

841
00:39:16,657 --> 00:39:18,437
Cooter's not
gonna recruit me!

842
00:39:18,471 --> 00:39:20,418
He said I...
I'd reached my ceiling.

843
00:39:20,452 --> 00:39:22,098
There are other colleges.

844
00:39:22,132 --> 00:39:24,638
Like there are other schools
for you besides NYADA?

845
00:39:24,665 --> 00:39:26,065
I'm not good enough!

846
00:39:26,117 --> 00:39:27,292
I'm not a good enough
quarterback

847
00:39:27,311 --> 00:39:29,201
to get a scholarship!

848
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,590
I'm not a good enough singer
to get into NYADA!

849
00:39:30,624 --> 00:39:32,342
It's all over for me!

850
00:39:32,344 --> 00:39:33,296
Stop it!

851
00:39:33,307 --> 00:39:34,894
Finn, look at me.

852
00:39:34,928 --> 00:39:37,830
Your dreams are
not dead, okay?

853
00:39:37,864 --> 00:39:38,711
You've just
grown out of them.

854
00:39:38,748 --> 00:39:40,494
You have to find
new ones now.

855
00:39:40,598 --> 00:39:41,832
I don't know how.

856
00:39:41,866 --> 00:39:43,405
Then we'll figure
it out together.

857
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:45,458
You're special.

858
00:39:45,492 --> 00:39:47,489
You know how I know that?

859
00:39:47,613 --> 00:39:49,157
Because I'm going
to give you something

860
00:39:49,215 --> 00:39:50,858
that no one else is
ever gonna get.

861
00:39:55,432 --> 00:39:58,372
You... You don't need
to do this, okay?

862
00:39:58,374 --> 00:39:59,654
The play's over.
There's no point.

863
00:39:59,656 --> 00:40:02,838
No, the point is, is that
I was wrong and stupid

864
00:40:02,874 --> 00:40:04,742
and immature, and probably
not for the last time,

865
00:40:04,744 --> 00:40:06,861
lost in my ambition and...

866
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:07,955
And now?

867
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:10,995
Now I'm just a girl,

868
00:40:11,029 --> 00:40:14,029
here with a boy
that she loves,

869
00:40:14,031 --> 00:40:16,009
and wanting to
remember this moment

870
00:40:16,011 --> 00:40:18,342
for the rest of her life.

871
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,493
With this ring, I thee wed.

872
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:32,640
