00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,873
<i>In days of old
when knights were bold</i>

2
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:34,349
<i>And nightshirts
held their sway</i>

3
00:00:34,419 --> 00:00:37,582
<i>A jolly minstrel
strummed his uke</i>

4
00:00:37,655 --> 00:00:42,752
<i>And sang this merry lay</i>

5
00:00:42,827 --> 00:00:46,126
<i>I am a wandering minstrel</i>

6
00:00:46,197 --> 00:00:49,655
<i> I journey from afar</i>

7
00:00:49,734 --> 00:00:52,828
<i> My worldly goods
are a sleepy old mule </i>

8
00:00:52,904 --> 00:00:56,396
<i> A song and a busted guitar
Ha-ha!</i>

9
00:00:56,474 --> 00:00:59,409
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

10
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:02,708
<i> A toast we'll sing
unto our king </i>

11
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,011
<i> To his good health
we'll sing </i>

12
00:01:06,084 --> 00:01:09,781
<i> A toast we'll sing
unto our king </i>

13
00:01:09,854 --> 00:01:14,791
<i> Long live the king </i>

14
00:01:16,227 --> 00:01:19,458
<i> O hear ye, loyal subjects </i>

15
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,658
<i> Of my kingdom
of Kalapazoo </i>

16
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:25,669
<i> Of our kingdom of Kalapazoo </i>

17
00:01:25,737 --> 00:01:29,434
<i> Upon this day
my daughter weds </i>

18
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:32,601
<i> The prince of Poopoopadoo </i>

19
00:01:32,677 --> 00:01:35,669
<i> The prince
of Poopoopadoo </i>

20
00:01:37,949 --> 00:01:39,940
Behold the prince!

21
00:01:41,686 --> 00:01:44,883
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh,
uh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-huh!

22
00:01:47,158 --> 00:01:49,126
Behold the princess!

23
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:14,814
<i> At my command
you'll give thy hand </i>

24
00:02:14,886 --> 00:02:17,616
<i>In wedlock to yon prince</i>

25
00:02:17,688 --> 00:02:21,624
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh,
uh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-huh!

26
00:02:21,692 --> 00:02:23,751
I know you'll learn
to love me.

27
00:02:25,496 --> 00:02:28,260
Never! Never!
Never!

28
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,036
She acts like a fanatic!

29
00:02:33,104 --> 00:02:35,072
Lock her in the attic!

30
00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:33,025
<i> Cheer up,
o lovely princess </i>

31
00:03:33,097 --> 00:03:35,827
<i> For you'll be rescued soon </i>

32
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,563
<i>I'll take thee away
so ye won't have to stay</i>

33
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:42,504
<i> And marry that silly baboon </i>

34
00:03:59,857 --> 00:04:01,791
Ha-ha!
Hello!

35
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:04,692
Shh!

37
00:04:07,465 --> 00:04:10,491
- Hath thou a rope?
- Nay, nay. No rope.

Clear the hall!
We'll have a duel!

00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:06,601
<i>And romance had its fling</i>

60
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:10,333
