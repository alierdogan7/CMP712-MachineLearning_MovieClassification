220
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,946

221
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:55,948
IN CHARGE
OF HIRING RIGS.

222
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,460
RIGS?

223
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,961
RIGGS?

224
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,964
AIN'T NOBODY HERE
BY THAT NAME.

225
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:12,965
MARCELLUS!

226
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:15,468
MARCELLUS WASHBURN!

227
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:19,972

229
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:24,477
GREGORY!

230
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:28,481
SHH! PROFESSOR HAROLD HILL'S
THE NAME THIS TRIP.

231
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,484
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU WERE COMING?

232
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:32,985
I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS, MYSELF.

233
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:35,488
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D FIND
A SLICKER LIKE YOU

234
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,990
OUT HERE IN THE HAILSTONE
AND SARSAPARILLA BELT.

235
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,492
THIS IS
WHERE I WORK.

236
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:41,494
YOU MEAN
YOU LIVE IN THIS TOWN?

237
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,997
YEAH!
I LIKE IT, TOO.

238
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,500
IT'S NOT BROOKLYN,
NEW YORK, BUT...

239
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,002
BROOKLYN?
THIS ISN'T EVEN DUBUQUE.

240
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,005
HEY, ARE YOU
HIDING OUT OR WHAT?

241
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,007
NO. JUST NOT
AS LIGHT ON MY FEET

242
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:58,010
AS I WAS WHEN I WAS
SHILLING FOR YOU.

243
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,514
YOU'RE IN A BUSINESS,
GOT A LOT OF CLOSE SHAVES.

244
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,517
I GOT A NICE JOB NOW
AND A NICE GIRL,

245
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,019
ETHEL TOFFELMIER,
THE BOSS' NIECE.

246
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,021
SO YOU'VE GONE
LEGITIMATE, HUH?

247
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:12,024
I KNEW
YOU'D COME TO NO GOOD.

248
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:14,026
WHAT ARE YOU SELLING?
LAST I HEARD,

249
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,028
YOU WERE SELLING
STEAM AUTOMOBILES.

250
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,530
I WAS.

251
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,031
WHAT HAPPENED?

252
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,033
SOMEBODY ACTUALLY
INVENTED ONE. NO.

253
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,536
SO NOW I'M BACK
AT THE OLD STAND.

254
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:25,037
NOT BOYS' BANDS.

255
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:28,040
THEY GOT NO CALL
FOR BOYS' BANDS HERE.

256
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,041
ANYTHING THEY DON'T
ALREADY HAVE,

257
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,543
THEY DO WITHOUT.

258
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,044
THEY GOT MUSIC?

259
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,046
THEY GOT A GRAMOPHONE
DOWN TO THE BARBERSHOP.

260
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,049
A STUCK-UP LIBRARIAN
GIVES PIANO.

261
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,551
MAIDEN LADY.

262
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,052
SHE'LL EXPOSE YOU

263
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,054
BEFORE YOU GET
THIS BAG UNPACKED.

264
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,557
YOU KNOW MAIDEN LADY
LIBRARIANS WHO GIVE PIANO

265
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,058
ARE A SPECIALTY OF MINE.

266
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:49,061
YOU JUST POINT HER OUT TO ME
THE MINUTE YOU SEE HER.

267
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,564
I'LL BACK HER
INTO A CORNER

268
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:54,066
AND BREATHE
ON HER GLASSES.

269
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,068
THAR SHE BLOWS.

270
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:04,577
I'LL DO IT,
BUT I WON'T LIKE IT.

271
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,579
THAT'S NOT
THE LIBRARIAN.

272
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:10,082
THAT'S MRS. SHINN,
THE MAYOR'S WIFE.

273
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:22,094
GOOD AFTERNOON,
MRS. SHINN.

274
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,096
DON'T CHANGE
THE SUBJECT.

275
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,599
IS SOMETHING
THE MATTER?

276
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:31,103
THE SAME THING THAT'S
ALWAYS THE MATTER HERE.

277
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:33,606
LOOK. IS THIS
THE SORT OF BOOK

278
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:36,108
YOU GIVE
MY DAUGHTER TO READ,

279
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:39,111
THISRUBY HAT
OF OMAR KAYAYAY?

280
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:40,613
I AM APPALLED!

281
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:43,115
I DID RECOMMEND IT.

282
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:45,117
IT'S BEAUTIFUL
PERSIAN POETRY.

283
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,119
IT'SDIRTY
PERSIAN POETRY.

284
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:50,623
PEOPLE LYING OUT
IN THE WOODS

285
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,124
EATING SANDWICHES,
GETTING DRUNK

286
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,126
WITH PITFALL
AND WITH GIN.

287
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:55,628
DRINKING DIRECTLY
OUT OF JUGS

288
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,129
WITH INNOCENT
YOUNG GIRLS.

289
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,130
NO DAUGHTER OF MINE
EVER--

290
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,632
MRS. SHINN!

291
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:03,636
THE RUBAIYAT OF OMAR
KHAYYAMIS A CLASSIC.

292
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,638
IT'S A SMUTTY BOOK,

293
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:10,142
LIKE MOST OF THE OTHERS
YOU KEEP HERE.

294
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:13,145
WOULDN'T YOU RATHER YOUR
DAUGHTER READ A CLASSIC

295
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:14,647
THAN ELINOR GLYN?

296
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:18,651
WHAT ELINOR GLYN READS
ISHERMOTHER'S PROBLEM.

297
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:23,656
JUST KEEP YOUR DIRTY BOOKS
AWAY FROMMYDAUGHTER.

298
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:45,678
MARCE, YOU SURE
PICKED YOURSELF A TOWN.

299
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:49,181
LET ME TAKE YOU
TO THE HOTEL.

300
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:51,183
I'M NOT SURE
I'M STAYING YET.

301
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,686
FIRST I'VE GOT TO
FIND A WAY

302
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:56,188
TO GET INTO SOME OF
THESE IOWA BOODLEBAGS.

303
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,190
GREG, IT AIN'T EASY.

304
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,693
I NEED AN OPENING.
YOU REMEMBER THE PITCH.

305
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,695
WHAT CAN I USE?
WHAT'S NEW AROUND HERE?

306
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:07,199
A FARMER BROUGHT IN
AN EGG HAD THREE YOLKS.

307
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,702
IT WAS IN THE PAPER.

308
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,204
OH, THAT'S EXCITING,
ALL RIGHT.

309
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,707
WHAT DO YOU
TALK ABOUT?

310
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,209
THERE'S THE WEATHER,
WHEN IT'S IN SEASON.

311
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,711
I NEED SOME IDEAS.

312
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,713
I'M GOING TO
GET YOUR TOWN

313
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,215
OUT OF THE SERIOUS
TROUBLE IT'S IN.

314
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:26,218
RIVER CITY
AIN'T IN ANY TROUBLE.

315
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:27,720
THEN I'LL HAVE
TO CREATE SOME.

316
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,721
MUST CREATE
A DESPERATE NEED

317
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,724
IN YOUR TOWN
FOR A BOYS' BAND.

318
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,726
WHY DOES EVERYBODY
KEEP RUBBERING

319
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,227
INTO THE BILLIARD
PARLOR?

320
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:39,231
THEY JUST GOT IN
A NEW POOL TABLE.

321
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:42,735
SURELY THEY'VE SEEN
A POOL TABLE BEFORE.

322
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,236
NO, JUST BILLIARDS.

323
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:51,243
THAT'LL DO IT.
JUST SIT WHERE YOU ARE.

324
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:54,246
REMEMBER, IF YOU SEE
THAT MUSIC TEACHER...

325
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:00,586
ARE YOU MR. DUNLOP?

326
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:01,587
YEAH.

327
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,088
WELL, EITHER YOU'RE
CLOSING YOUR EYES

328
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,090

NOT WISH TO ACKNOWLEDGE,

01:10:14,635 --> 01:10:17,137
MR. MAYOR!
YOUR HAND.

1356
01:10:17,137 --> 01:10:18,138
ISN'T THAT AMAZING?

1357
01:10:18,138 --> 01:10:19,139
WHAT? WHAT?

1358
01:10:19,139 --> 01:10:21,642
THAT SPREAD OF
THE LITTLE FINGER--

1359
01:10:21,642 --> 01:10:22,643
IT'S HEREDITARY.

1360
01:10:22,643 --> 01:10:24,144
IT IS?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

1361
01:10:24,144 --> 01:10:26,647
WHY, IT MEANS THAT
YOUR SON'S LITTLE FINGER

1362
01:10:26,647 --> 01:10:28,148
IS PERFECTLY SITUATED
TO OPERATE

1363
01:10:28,148 --> 01:10:29,650
THE SPIT VALVE
ON A B-FLAT FLUGELHORN.

1364
01:10:29,650 --> 01:10:31,151
IS THAT GOOD?

1365
01:10:31,652 --> 01:10:32,653
GOOD?

1366
01:10:32,653 --> 01:10:35,155
IT ALSO MEANS AMERICA
HAS PRODUCED AN ARTIST

1367
01:10:35,155 --> 01:10:36,156
WHO CAN FLUGEL
THEMINUTE WALTZ

1368
01:10:36,156 --> 01:10:37,157
IN 5O SECONDS.

1369
01:10:37,157 --> 01:10:38,659
HOW CAN I GET
ONE OF THOSE HORNS?

1370
01:10:39,159 --> 01:10:40,160
SIGN HERE,
MR. MAYOR.

1371
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:41,662
YES, SIR.

1372
01:10:41,662 --> 01:10:43,163
FINE, FINE.

1373
01:10:43,163 --> 01:10:45,666
THAT WILL BE $17
IMPORT FEE.

1374
01:10:45,666 --> 01:10:47,668
JUST THINK, I COULD HAVE
MISSED THIS WHOLE THING.

1375
01:10:48,168 --> 01:10:51,171
MY SON COULD HAVE...

1376
01:10:51,171 --> 01:10:53,674
I HAVEN'T GOT
ANY SON!

1377
01:10:53,674 --> 01:10:55,676
OH, GEORGE.

1378
01:10:55,676 --> 01:10:58,178
I NEVER HAD A SON!

1379
01:10:58,178 --> 01:10:59,680
I NEVER SAID
YOU DID.

1380
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:00,681
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

1381
01:11:00,681 --> 01:11:03,684
I'D CERTAINLY KNOW
IF I GAVE YOU A SON.

1382
01:11:03,684 --> 01:11:04,685
I'M NOT
TALKING TO YOU.

1383
01:11:04,685 --> 01:11:06,186
WELL, WHO ARE YOU
TALKING TO?

1384
01:11:06,687 --> 01:11:07,688
HIM.
WHO?

1385
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:11,692
NEVER MIND.

1386
01:11:11,692 --> 01:11:15,696
ZANEETA, CALL DR. PYNE
FOR YOUR FATHER.

1387
01:11:18,198 --> 01:11:22,703
AH, YES, MY DEAR MRS. PAROO,
YOU MUST REALIZE

1388
01:11:22,703 --> 01:11:24,705
THAT ONLY 1
OUT OF EVERY 78 ADULTS

1389
01:11:24,705 --> 01:11:27,207
HAS A GANGLION THAT
REACHES THE LIGATURE

1390
01:11:27,708 --> 01:11:28,208
CLEAR DOWN TO THE APEX.

1391
01:11:28,709 --> 01:11:30,711
THIS AUTOMATICALLY
TURNS YOUR ENTIRE FACE

1392
01:11:30,711 --> 01:11:33,213
INTO AN AMAZING
EMBOUCHURE.

1393
01:11:33,213 --> 01:11:35,716
I AIN'T NEVER HAD A SICK DAY
IN ME LIFE, DOCTOR.

1394
01:11:36,216 --> 01:11:37,718
PROFESSOR.

1395
01:11:37,718 --> 01:11:41,221
PROFESSOR. WHAT
SHALL I DO FOR IT?

1396
01:11:41,221 --> 01:11:43,223
NO, YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

1397
01:11:43,223 --> 01:11:44,224
I'M TRYING
TO TELL YOU

1398
01:11:44,224 --> 01:11:46,226
THAT YOU HAVE ALL OF
THE FACIAL CHARACTERISTICS

1399
01:11:46,226 --> 01:11:48,729
OF A CORNET VIRTUOSO.

1400
01:11:48,729 --> 01:11:51,231
IF YOUR BOY HAS
THAT SAME FIRM CHIN,

1401
01:11:51,231 --> 01:11:53,233
THOSE SPLENDID
CHEEK MUSCLES--

1402
01:11:53,233 --> 01:11:55,235
OH, BY GEORGE...

1403
01:11:55,235 --> 01:11:57,738
NOT THAT HE COULD EVER REALLY
BE GREAT, YOU UNDERSTAND.

1404
01:11:58,238 --> 01:12:00,240
OH, IS THAT SO?

1405
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,242
AND IN THE NAME OF
ST. BRIDGET, WHY NOT?

1406
01:12:02,242 --> 01:12:05,746
ALL OF THE REALLY GREAT
CORNET PLAYERS WERE IRISH--

1407
01:12:05,746 --> 01:12:08,248
O'CLARK,
O'MENDEZ, O'KLEIN.

1408
01:12:08,248 --> 01:12:10,751
BUT, PROFESSOR,
WEAREIRISH.

1409
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:14,254
NO. NO, REALLY?
WELL, THAT CLINCHES IT.

1410
01:12:14,254 --> 01:12:15,255
SIGN HERE, MADAM.

1411
01:12:15,756 --> 01:12:17,758
YOUR BOY WAS BORN
TO PLAY THE CORNET.

1412
01:12:18,258 --> 01:12:19,760
OH, FINE, FINE.

1413
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:22,262
THAT WILL BE $7.OO
EARNEST MONEY.

1414
01:12:22,262 --> 01:12:24,264
NOTHING MORE DUE UNTIL
THE FIRST INSTALLMENT,

1415
01:12:24,765 --> 01:12:26,266
PAYABLE AT THE OPENING
OF BAND PRACTICE.

1416
01:12:26,266 --> 01:12:27,267
OH, THANK YOU.

1417
01:12:27,768 --> 01:12:28,769
AND OF COURSE, I'LL NEED
YOUR BOY'S MEASUREMENTS

1418
01:12:28,769 --> 01:12:30,270
FOR HIS BAND UNIFORM.

1419
01:12:30,771 --> 01:12:32,272
HIS UNIFORM?

1420
01:12:32,272 --> 01:12:33,273
OH, YES.

1421
01:12:33,273 --> 01:12:34,775
WINTHROP!

1422
01:12:34,775 --> 01:12:36,777
WELL!
HELLO THERE, SON.

1423
01:12:36,777 --> 01:12:38,278
WHY, CERTAINLY,
HIS UNIFORM.

1424
01:12:38,278 --> 01:12:41,782
AND THERE WON'T BE A PENNY
DUE UNTIL DELIVERY,

1425
01:12:41,782 --> 01:12:44,284
WHICH GIVES HIM 4 WEEKS

1426
01:12:44,284 --> 01:12:45,786
TO ENJOY,
TO ANTICPATE, TO IMAGINE

1427
01:12:45,786 --> 01:12:47,788
AT NO COST WHATSOEVER.

1428
01:12:47,788 --> 01:12:49,790
NEVER ALLOW THE DEMANDS
OF TOMORROW TO INTERFERE

1429
01:12:49,790 --> 01:12:52,793
WITH THE PLEASURES
AND EXCITEMENTS OF TODAY.

1430
01:12:52,793 --> 01:12:55,295
WILL IT
HAVE A...A...

1431
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:56,296
A...?

1432
01:12:57,798 --> 01:12:59,299
A STRIPE!

1433
01:12:59,299 --> 01:13:01,301
WHY CERTAINLY,
MY BOY!

1434
01:13:01,301 --> 01:13:03,303
A WIDE RED STRIPE
DOWN EACH SIDE.

1435
01:13:03,303 --> 01:13:04,805
NOW, WHAT DO YOU
THINK OF THAT?

1436
01:13:07,307 --> 01:13:09,810
[BARKS]

1437
01:13:09,810 --> 01:13:12,779
YOU'LL HAVE TO EXCUSE
WINTHROP, PROFESSOR.

1438
01:13:12,779 --> 01:13:16,783
WE CAN'T GET HIM TO SAY
3 WORDS A DAY--

1439
01:13:16,783 --> 01:13:17,784
NOT EVEN TO US.

1440
01:13:18,285 --> 01:13:21,288
AND IF YOU CAN GET HIM
TO PLAY IN THAT BAND,

1441
01:13:21,288 --> 01:13:24,291
YOU'LL HAVE SAINT MICHAEL'S
OWN WAY WITH YOU.

1442
01:13:24,291 --> 01:13:27,294
BUT IF ANYBODY CAN DO IT,
I BET YOU CAN.

1443
01:13:27,294 --> 01:13:28,295
THANK YOU.

1444
01:13:28,295 --> 01:13:30,297
YOU'VE A GIFT OF
THE BLARNEY ABOUT YOU

1445
01:13:30,297 --> 01:13:31,798
AND NO MISTAKING
ABOUT THAT.

1446
01:13:32,299 --> 01:13:33,800
WHERE ARE YOU FROM,
MY BOY?

1447
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:34,801
GARY, INDIANA.

1448
01:13:34,801 --> 01:13:37,304
I KNEW IT! GAR--
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

1449
01:13:37,804 --> 01:13:38,305
GARY, INDIANA.

1450
01:13:38,805 --> 01:13:41,308
IN FACT, GARY CONSERVATORY
WAS MY ALMA MATER.

1451
01:13:41,308 --> 01:13:42,309
WAS SHE?

1452
01:13:42,309 --> 01:13:46,313

MAMA!

1487
01:15:38,425 --> 01:15:40,927
HOW DO YOU DO,
MISS PAROO?

1488
01:15:41,428 --> 01:15:42,929
HOW DO YOU DO,
MR. HILL?

1489
01:15:42,929 --> 01:15:44,931
OF COURSE--PAROO!

1490
01:15:45,432 --> 01:15:46,433
I THOUGHT THE NAME
SOUNDED FAMILIAR.

1491
01:15:46,433 --> 01:15:49,436
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO SEE YOU
SINCE THE OTHER NIGHT.

1492
01:15:49,436 --> 01:15:50,437
HE WANTS TO PUT
WINTHROP IN THE BAND.

1493
01:15:50,437 --> 01:15:52,939
WE'RE NOT
INTERESTED, MAMA.

1494
01:15:52,939 --> 01:15:56,443
BUT THE BOY MIGHT HAVE
HIS FATHER'S MUSICAL GIFT.

1495
01:15:56,443 --> 01:15:58,445
HE DOES HAVE
MY GANGLION, YOU KNOW.

1496
01:15:58,445 --> 01:16:00,447
YOUR HUSBAND
IS MUSICAL?

1497
01:16:00,447 --> 01:16:01,948
WELL, I'D LIKE
TO TALK TO HIM.

1498
01:16:01,948 --> 01:16:04,451
DO YOU ALWAYS BURST
INTO PEOPLE'S HOMES,

1499
01:16:04,451 --> 01:16:05,952
PRYING INTO
PERSONAL AFFAIRS?

1500
01:16:05,952 --> 01:16:07,454
WE'RE NOT
INTERESTED.

1501
01:16:07,454 --> 01:16:08,455
MARIAN!

1502
01:16:08,955 --> 01:16:10,957
WELL, THERE'S ONE FOR
AND ONE AGAINST.

1503
01:16:10,957 --> 01:16:13,960
WHY NOT LET THE BOY'S
FATHER DECIDE?

1504
01:16:14,461 --> 01:16:16,463
THE BOY'S FATHER
IS DEAD.

1505
01:16:16,463 --> 01:16:18,465
ANYTHING ELSE?

1506
01:16:18,965 --> 01:16:22,469
OH, I AM SORRY.

1507
01:16:22,469 --> 01:16:23,470
BUT THAT'S
ALL THE MORE REASON

1508
01:16:23,470 --> 01:16:24,971
WHY YOUR BROTHER SHOULD
HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

1509
01:16:24,971 --> 01:16:26,973
MY BROTHER IS
AN UNHAPPY CHILD

1510
01:16:26,973 --> 01:16:27,974
WHO CAN'T UNDERSTAND

1511
01:16:27,974 --> 01:16:29,476
WHY HIS FATHER
WAS TAKEN AWAY.

1512
01:16:29,976 --> 01:16:30,977
WOULD YOU CARE TO
EXPLAIN IT TO HIM?

1513
01:16:31,478 --> 01:16:33,980
HE'S BEEN BROODING
ABOUT IT FOR 2 YEARS.

1514
01:16:34,481 --> 01:16:35,482
AND AS FOR
YOUR MUSICAL TRICKS,

1515
01:16:35,982 --> 01:16:36,983
WHY DON'T YOU
GO INTO BUSINESS

1516
01:16:36,983 --> 01:16:37,984
WITH SOME NICE
CARNIVAL MAN

1517
01:16:37,984 --> 01:16:39,486
WHO SELLS
GOLD-PAINTED WATCHES

1518
01:16:39,986 --> 01:16:41,488
AND GLASS-DIAMOND RINGS?

1519
01:16:41,988 --> 01:16:44,491
MUSICAL TRICKS?
NOW, MISS PAROO--

1520
01:16:48,995 --> 01:16:50,497
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A FEELING
SHE LIKES THE IDEA.

1521
01:16:50,997 --> 01:16:51,998
OH, A LITTLE CAUTIOUS,
PERHAPS,

1522
01:16:51,998 --> 01:16:54,000
BUT I ADMIRE THAT
IN A WOMAN.

1523
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,001
YOU JUST KEEP ME ALIVE,

1524
01:16:55,001 --> 01:16:56,002
AND I'LL BE BACK
LATER IN THE WEEK.

1525
01:16:56,002 --> 01:16:59,005
I DO HOPE YOU'LL
EXCUSE MARIAN, PROFESSOR.

1526
01:16:59,005 --> 01:17:00,006
SHE'S NOT REALLY--

1527
01:17:00,006 --> 01:17:03,009
OH, PLEASE. DON'T YOU
WORRY ABOUT A THING.

1528
01:17:03,009 --> 01:17:05,512
I'M SURE THAT AT HEART

1529
01:17:05,512 --> 01:17:08,515
SHE'S AS LOVELY
AS YOURSELF.

1530
01:17:09,015 --> 01:17:12,018
GOOD DAY TO YOU,
WIDOW PAROO.

1531
01:17:18,525 --> 01:17:23,029
AHHHHH.

1532
01:17:34,207 --> 01:17:36,209
HAS HE GONE?

1533
01:17:36,209 --> 01:17:37,710
HE HAS, AND I HOPE
NOT FOREVER.

1534
01:17:37,710 --> 01:17:41,214
DARLING, DON'T YOU EVER
THINK OF YOUR FUTURE?

1535
01:17:41,214 --> 01:17:43,716
NOW, MAMA, A GIRL'S FUTURE
DOESN'T DEPEND

1536
01:17:43,716 --> 01:17:47,220
ON ENCOURAGING EVERY
FAST-TALKING, SELF-CENTERED,

1537
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:49,222
WOMAN-CHASING TRAVELING MAN
WHO COMES TO TOWN.

1538
01:17:49,722 --> 01:17:51,724
ALL RIGHT, DARLING,
ALL RIGHT.

1539
01:17:51,724 --> 01:17:53,226
ONLY IT'S A WELL-KNOWN
PRINCIPLE

1540
01:17:53,226 --> 01:17:54,727
THAT IF YOU KEEP
THE FLINT IN ONE DRAWER

1541
01:17:54,727 --> 01:17:56,729
AND THE STEEL
IN THE OTHER

1542
01:17:56,729 --> 01:17:57,730
YOU'LL NEVER STRIKE
MUCH OF A FIRE.

1543
01:17:57,730 --> 01:17:59,232
MAMA!

1544
01:17:59,232 --> 01:18:02,235
A FINE-LOOKING MAN
AND EDUCATED--

1545
01:18:02,235 --> 01:18:03,236
GARY, INDIANA,

1546
01:18:03,236 --> 01:18:05,738
CONSERVATION CLASS
OF 'O5.

1547
01:18:05,738 --> 01:18:07,740
THE FACT THAT HE CLAIMS
HIS COMMODITY IS MUSIC

1548
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:10,743
DOES NOT IN THIS
PARTICULAR CASE IMPRESS ME,

1549
01:18:10,743 --> 01:18:12,745
NOR DOES ANYTHING
ELSE ABOUT HIM.

1550
01:18:12,745 --> 01:18:14,247
WELL, I GIVE UP.

1551
01:18:14,247 --> 01:18:15,748
AT YOUR AGE--IF YOU
DON'T MIND MY ASKING--

1552
01:18:16,249 --> 01:18:18,251
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

1553
01:18:18,251 --> 01:18:20,253
WELL, I'M NOT WAITING
FOR ED GRINER,

1554
01:18:20,253 --> 01:18:21,754
WHO BACKS ME INTO
THE ANCIENT HISTORY SHELF

1555
01:18:21,754 --> 01:18:23,256
EVERY TIME HE COMES
INTO THE LIBRARY.

1556
01:18:23,756 --> 01:18:24,757
HE DOES?

1557
01:18:24,757 --> 01:18:26,259
OR ED GAMMAGE,

1558
01:18:26,259 --> 01:18:28,761
WHO HAS THE BUGGY WITH
THE REMOVABLE BACK SEAT.

1559
01:18:29,262 --> 01:18:31,764
WELL, IF YOU'RE WAITING FOR
A KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR

1560
01:18:31,764 --> 01:18:33,766
TO COME RIDING
UP THE STREET...

1561
01:18:33,766 --> 01:18:36,269
WELL, I'M NOT WAITING
FOR THAT, EITHER, MAMA.

1562
01:18:36,269 --> 01:18:39,272
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

1563
01:18:39,272 --> 01:18:42,275
MARIAN PAROO, IF YOU
DON'T MIND MY ASKING,

1564
01:18:42,275 --> 01:18:44,777
DON'T YOU EVER THINK
ABOUT BEING IN LOVE?

1565
01:18:44,777 --> 01:18:46,779

YES. THE VERY FIRST
THING I SAID,

1665
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:30,323
OR I'LL EAT HAY
WITH A HORSE--

1666
01:24:30,323 --> 01:24:32,325
"GET THAT SPELLBINDER'S
CREDENTIALS!" I SAID,

1667
01:24:32,325 --> 01:24:34,327
MORNING OF JULY 4, 1912.

1668
01:24:34,327 --> 01:24:38,331
NOW MY WIFE
IS OFF DANCING

1669
01:24:38,831 --> 01:24:41,834
AT ANY AND ALL HOURS
INSTEAD OF IN THE HOME,

1670
01:24:41,834 --> 01:24:45,338
THE SCHOOL BOARD IS SINGING
UP STREET AND DOWN

1671
01:24:45,338 --> 01:24:46,839
INSTEAD OF TENDING
TO CITY MATTERS,

1672
01:24:46,839 --> 01:24:48,341
MY OLDEST GIRL
IS BOODLING AROUND

1673
01:24:48,341 --> 01:24:49,342
WITH SOME WILD KID,

1674
01:24:49,842 --> 01:24:51,344
AND MY BUSINESS
HAS FELL OFF SO FAR

1675
01:24:51,344 --> 01:24:52,345
I CAN'T FIND
THE BALANCE SHEET.

1676
01:24:52,345 --> 01:24:54,347
MAYOR SHINN,
I FOUND SOMETHING

1677
01:24:54,347 --> 01:24:55,848
VERY INTERESTING
IN THIS BOOK

1678
01:24:55,848 --> 01:24:57,350
ABOUT PROFESSOR
HILL'S ALMA MATER.

1679
01:24:57,850 --> 01:24:58,851
I KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT.

1680
01:24:58,851 --> 01:25:00,353
IN FACT, THAT'S ALL I CAN
EVER GET OUT OF HIM--

1681

GARY CONSERVATORY,
CLASS OF 'O5.

1682

1864
01:33:13,178 --> 01:33:15,180
IF I EVER CATCH YOU
TOUCHING MY DAUGHTER,

1865
01:33:15,180 --> 01:33:16,682
I'LL HORSEWHIP YOU.

1866
01:33:17,182 --> 01:33:17,683
NOW, GEORGE!

1867
01:33:18,183 --> 01:33:20,686
NOT ONE POOP
OUT OF YOU, MADAM.

1868
01:33:21,186 --> 01:33:24,690
I THINK
HE MEANS PEEP.

1869
01:33:24,690 --> 01:33:25,691
YEAH.

1870
01:33:28,193 --> 01:33:31,196
NOW GET OUT
OF THIS PUBLIC EMPORIUM!

1871
01:33:31,196 --> 01:33:33,699
I GOT AS MUCH RIGHT
IN A PUBLIC EMPORIUM

1872
01:33:33,699 --> 01:33:34,700
AS ANYBODY!

1873
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:37,202
RIGHT? HOW DO YOU GET
ANY RIGHT AROUND HERE,

1874
01:33:37,202 --> 01:33:38,203
AIDING AND ABETTING
THE SWINDLING ACTIVITIES

1875
01:33:38,203 --> 01:33:40,706
OF THIS SPELLBINDING
CYMBAL SALESMAN?

1876
01:33:40,706 --> 01:33:42,207
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I SEE
WRITTEN ALL OVER YOU?

1877
01:33:42,708 --> 01:33:43,709
REFORM SCHOOL.

1878
01:33:43,709 --> 01:33:45,210
NOW GET OUT!

1879
01:33:45,210 --> 01:33:47,212
GET OUT,
YOU WILD KID, YOU!

1880
01:33:47,212 --> 01:33:48,213
PAPA, PLEASE!

1881
01:33:48,213 --> 01:33:50,716
IT'S CAPULETS LIKE YOU

1882
01:33:50,716 --> 01:33:52,217
MAKE BLOOD
IN THE MARKETPLACE!

1883
01:33:52,217 --> 01:33:54,219
YE GODS!

1884
01:33:54,219 --> 01:33:55,220
YOU WATCH YOUR
PHRASEOLOGY,

1885
01:33:55,220 --> 01:33:56,722
YOUNG WOMAN!

1886
01:33:56,722 --> 01:33:57,723
GO HOME.

1887
01:33:59,725 --> 01:34:02,227
TAKING UP
WITH WILD KIDS

1888
01:34:02,728 --> 01:34:03,729
FROM THE WRONG SIDE
OF TOWN...

1889
01:34:03,729 --> 01:34:06,732
MAYOR SHINN, IF I COULD
JUST MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND.

1890
01:34:06,732 --> 01:34:08,233
WELL, YOU CAN'T!

1891
01:34:08,734 --> 01:34:10,736
AND, BY THE WAY, THANKS
FOR THE BUGGY RIDE.

1892
01:34:11,236 --> 01:34:12,237
I READ THAT BOOK
YOU GAVE ME

1893
01:34:12,237 --> 01:34:14,239
FROM COVER TO COVER
FOR A WHOLE WEEK NOW

1894
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:15,741
AND DIDN'T FIND
A THING.

1895
01:34:15,741 --> 01:34:17,242
MR. MAYOR,
IF YOU PLEASE--

1896
01:34:17,242 --> 01:34:18,243
I'LL SETTLE YOUR HASH

1897
01:34:18,243 --> 01:34:19,244
AS SOON AS I GET
THESE PREMISES

1898
01:34:19,244 --> 01:34:20,746
OFF MY OLDEST GIRL.

1899
01:34:22,748 --> 01:34:23,749
YES?

1900
01:34:23,749 --> 01:34:24,750
ALL RIGHT,
BUT IN THE MEANTIME,

1901
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:27,252
I'D LIKE YOU TO KNOW
I'M VOUCHING FOR TOMMY DJILAS.

1902
01:34:27,252 --> 01:34:29,755
THAT BOY HAS THE CONFIDENCE
OF EVERY KID IN THIS TOWN.

1903
01:34:29,755 --> 01:34:31,256
YOU'LL BE STANDING IN LINE
WAITING TO SHAKE HIS HAND

1904
01:34:31,256 --> 01:34:34,259
BY THE TIME OUR BAND PLAYS
ITS FIRST CONCERT.

1905
01:34:34,259 --> 01:34:36,261
BY THAT TIME, MY FINE
YOUNG FEATHERED--

1906
01:34:36,762 --> 01:34:39,264
MY FEATHERED YOUNG--
MY FEATHERED FINE--

1907
01:34:39,765 --> 01:34:41,266
NEVER MIND!

1908
01:34:42,768 --> 01:34:44,770
HA HA HA HA!

1909
01:34:44,770 --> 01:34:46,772
OLIVER, JACEY,
EWART, OLIN!

1910
01:34:46,772 --> 01:34:49,274
I WANT THAT MAN'S
REFERENCES,

1911
01:34:49,274 --> 01:34:51,777
AND I WANT THEM
TONIGHT!

1912
01:34:51,777 --> 01:34:53,779
HE'S SLIPPERIER THAN
A MISSISSIPPI...

1913
01:34:53,779 --> 01:34:54,780
STURGEON.

1914
01:34:54,780 --> 01:34:57,282
I THINK MAYOR SHINN
BEHAVED ABOMINABLY,

1915
01:34:57,282 --> 01:34:59,284
AND I THINK IT WAS
WONDERFUL OF YOU

1916
01:34:59,284 --> 01:35:01,787
STICKING UP FOR TOMMY DJILAS
THE WAY YOU DID.

1917
01:35:01,787 --> 01:35:02,788
OH, THAT WAS NOTHING.

1918
01:35:02,788 --> 01:35:04,790
OH, YES, IT WAS.

1919
01:35:04,790 --> 01:35:06,291
WELL, A MAN CAN'T GO BACK
ON HIS PRINCIPLES

1920
01:35:06,291 --> 01:35:09,294
MERELY BECAUSE A LITTLE
PERSONAL RISK IS INVOLVED.

1921
01:35:09,795 --> 01:35:11,296
WHAT DOES THE POET SAY?

1922
01:35:11,797 --> 01:35:13,799
"A COWARD DIES
A THOUSAND DEATHS,

1923
01:35:13,799 --> 01:35:17,803
A BRAVE MAN...
ONLY 500."

1924
01:35:17,803 --> 01:35:19,304
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

1925
01:35:19,304 --> 01:35:21,807
GET HIS PAPERS
OR GET HIM IN JAIL!

1926
01:35:21,807 --> 01:35:23,308
I COULDN'T MAKE
MYSELF ANY CLEARER

1927
01:35:23,308 --> 01:35:27,813
IF I WAS A BUTTONHOOK
IN THE WELL WATER!

1928
01:35:29,815 --> 01:35:31,817
I'VE BEEN WANTING
TO TALK TO YOU

1929
01:35:32,317 --> 01:35:33,318
ABOUT WINTHROP'S CORNET.

1930
01:35:33,819 --> 01:35:34,820
OH, YES.
A BEAUTIFUL INSTRUMENT--

1931
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:36,321
HAND-HAMMERED BRASS,

1932
01:35:36,321 --> 01:35:37,823
MOTHER-OF-PEARL KEYS.

1933
01:35:37,823 --> 01:35:39,324
BUT HE NEVER TOUCHES
THE CORNET.

1934
01:35:39,825 --> 01:35:41,326
HE SAID YOU TOLD HIM
IT WASN'T NECESSARY.

1935
01:35:41,326 --> 01:35:43,328
YOU MUST UNDERSTAND,
MISS MARIAN--

1936
01:35:43,829 --> 01:35:45,831
SOMETHING ABOUT
A THINK SYSTEM.

1937
01:35:46,331 --> 01:35:48,333
HE SAYS IF HETHINKS
THEMINUET IN G,

1938
01:35:48,333 --> 01:35:49,835
HE CAN PLAY IT.

1939
01:35:50,335 --> 01:35:52,337
I ADMIT IT'S STILL IN
THE EXPERIMENTAL STAGES,

1940
01:35:52,337 --> 01:35:55,841
AND I SUPPOSE TO
A SEASONED PROFESSIONAL

1941
01:35:55,841 --> 01:35:56,842
IT MAY SEEM LUDICROUS.

1942
01:35:57,342 --> 01:35:59,344
OH, YOU MUSTN'T
SAY THAT.

1943
01:35:59,845 --> 01:36:00,846
I MUSTN'T?

1944
01:36:00,846 --> 01:36:02,848
NO. WHY,
THROUGHOUT HISTORY,

1945
01:36:03,348 --> 01:36:05,851
THE TRUE ORIGINATOR
IS ALWAYS LAUGHED AT.

1946
01:36:05,851 --> 01:36:07,352
I HOPE YOU DON'T
CLASS ME

1947
01:36:07,352 --> 01:36:10,355
WITH THOSE SMALL MINDS
WHO RIDICULED--

1948
01:36:10,355 --> 01:36:11,857
GALILEO.

1949
01:36:11,857 --> 01:36:13,859
YES. AND HIS CONCEPTION
OF THE HEAVENS.

1950
01:36:13,859 --> 01:36:15,360
OR FULTON.

1951
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,862
YES. OR COLUMBUS.

1952
01:36:16,862 --> 01:36:21,366
AND HIS CONCEPTION
OF THE EGG. UH, GLOBE.

1953
01:36:21,366 --> 01:36:23,368
THE ONE THING
ONE MUST REMEMBER,

1954
01:36:23,368 --> 01:36:26,371
NO MATTER WHO ONE IS
OR WHAT ONE IS WORKING FOR,

1955
01:36:26,371 --> 01:36:29,374
ONE CAN DO ANYTHING
IF ONE PUTS ONE'S MIND TO IT.

1956
01:36:29,374 --> 01:36:32,377
MISS MARIAN, IF ONE
COULD ONLY TELL YOU

1957
01:36:32,377 --> 01:36:36,381
HOW MUCH
YOU'VE DONE FOR ONE.

1958
01:36:36,381 --> 01:36:39,384
I WOULD DEEM IT
A GREAT PRIVILEGE

1959
01:36:39,384 --> 01:36:41,887
TO TALK WITH YOU
AGAIN.

1960
01:36:41,887 --> 01:36:43,889
WELL, ALL I SAID--

1961
01:36:43,889 --> 01:36:46,892
MAY ONE CALL UPON YOU
SOME EVENING?

1962
01:36:48,894 --> 01:36:51,396
ANY NIGHT THIS WEEK.

1963
01:37:11,250 --> 01:37:15,254
[WHISTLINGGARY, INDIANA]

1964
01:37:15,254 --> 01:37:18,257
GOOD EVENING,
GENTLEMEN.

1965
01:37:18,257 --> 01:37:21,260
SORRY, PROFESSOR,
BUT WE GOT OUR ORDERS.

1966
01:37:21,260 --> 01:37:23,762
WE ALL
BEEN DEPUTIZED.

1967
01:37:23,762 --> 01:37:26,265
YES, YES, YES, YES.
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.

1968
01:37:26,265 --> 01:37:28,267
NOW, LET ME SEE.
EVERY TIME I TRY

1969
01:37:28,267 --> 01:37:29,768
TO GIVE YOU FELLOWS
THOSE CREDENTIALS,

1970
01:37:30,269 --> 01:37:32,771
YOU ALWAYS TRY TO CHANGE
THE SUBJECT SOMEHOW.

1971
01:37:32,771 --> 01:37:34,273
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
A CONSPIRACY.

1972
01:37:34,273 --> 01:37:35,774
I'LL JUST GO TO MY ROOM
AND GET THEM RIGHT NOW.

1973
01:37:36,275 --> 01:37:38,277
SORRY. AFRAID
I'LL HAVE TO GO WITH YOU.

1974
01:37:38,777 --> 01:37:40,779
OH, YES.

1975
01:37:40,779 --> 01:37:43,282
WELL, LET'S SEE
IF I HAVE MY KEY.

1976
01:37:43,282 --> 01:37:44,783
WHAT'S THIS?

1977
01:37:47,786 --> 01:37:49,288
WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

1978
01:37:50,789 --> 01:37:53,292
A TESTIMONIAL FROM THE ONLY
FEMALE BASSOON PLAYER

1979
01:37:53,292 --> 01:37:54,793
EVER TO APPEAR
ON THE REDPATH CIRCUIT--

1980
01:37:55,294 --> 01:37:55,794
MADAME REENYHOOK.

1981
01:37:56,295 --> 01:37:57,296
OH, THAT'S
HER STAGE NAME, OF COURSE.

1982
01:37:57,296 --> 01:38:00,299
ACTUALLY, SHE'S FROM MOLINE.
LIDA ROSE QUACKENBUSH.

1983
01:38:00,299 --> 01:38:02,301
COULDN'T I
JUST SEE THAT?

1984
01:38:02,301 --> 01:38:03,302
YOU NEVER FORGET
THE NAME LIDA ROSE.

1985
01:38:03,802 --> 01:38:04,803
JUST LIKE
IN THE OLD SONG.

1986

2263
01:51:02,713 --> 01:51:03,714
WHAT I'M TRYING
TO SAY IS...

2264
01:51:03,714 --> 01:51:04,715
YES?

2265
01:51:04,715 --> 01:51:06,717
I WAS WONDERING...

2266
01:51:08,219 --> 01:51:11,722
HOW YOU DEVELOPED

2267
01:51:11,722 --> 01:51:13,724

01:51:13,724 --> 01:51:15,226

AS WHISTLING.

2271
01:51:20,231 --> 01:51:21,732

THOUGHT UP THE SAME SYSTEM

2288

BEFORE I GOT TO HER TOWN.

2289
01:52:06,777 --> 01:52:09,780

A FEW REFINEMENTS.

2290
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:11,282
I SEE.

2291
01:52:11,282 --> 01:52:13,784
HAVE I SAID
SOMETHING WRONG?

2292
01:52:13,784 --> 01:52:16,787

KEEP YOU, PROFESSOR HILL.

IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO

2294
01:52:18,789 --> 01:52:20,791

AN IDEA LIKE THAT?

2299
01:52:30,801 --> 01:52:33,804

TRAVELING SALESMEN.

2300
01:52:33,804 --> 01:52:36,807
YOU MUSTN'T BELIEVE
EVERYTHING YOU HEAR.

2301
01:52:36,807 --> 01:52:37,808
AFTER ALL,

2302
01:52:37,808 --> 01:52:40,811
ONE EVEN HEARS RUMORS
ABOUT LIBRARIANS.

2303
01:52:40,811 --> 01:52:41,812

COULD HAVE SOME SECURITY.

2310

YOUDON'T BELIEVE--

2311
01:52:57,328 --> 01:52:59,830
NO, NO, NO, BUT THAT'S
JUST WHAT I'M SAYING.

2312
01:53:00,331 --> 01:53:02,833
WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE
PEOPLE START THOSE RUMORS?

2313
01:53:02,833 --> 01:53:04,835
NARROW-MINDEDNESS,
JEALOUSY.

2314
01:53:04,835 --> 01:53:06,837
JEALOUSY,
MOSTLY, I GUESS.

2315
01:53:06,837 --> 01:53:07,838
EXACTLY!

2316
01:53:07,838 --> 01:53:11,342

ABOUT TRAVELING SALESMEN.

ABOUT YOU PERSONALLY.

2320
01:53:35,866 --> 01:53:38,869
WELL, WHAT
HAVE YOU HEARD GENERALLY?

2321
01:53:39,370 --> 01:53:40,871
JUST THAT...

2322
01:53:42,373 --> 01:53:44,375
BUT, OF COURSE!

2323
01:53:44,375 --> 01:53:46,377
IT STANDS TO REASON

2324
01:53:46,377 --> 01:53:48,379
THAT DISAPPOINTMENT
AND JEALOUSY

2325
01:53:48,379 --> 01:53:49,880
CAN LEAD TO--

2326
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:51,882
TAKE YOU,
FOR INSTANCE.

2327
01:53:51,882 --> 01:53:54,885
YOUR ATTENTIONS TO
CUSTOMERS AND TEACHERS

2328
01:53:54,885 --> 01:53:56,387
MIGHT EASILY
BE MISCONSTRUED,

MIGHTN'T THEY?

2330
01:53:57,888 --> 01:54:00,891
I MEAN, NOW, HONESTLY,
MIGHTN'T THEY?

2331
01:54:01,392 --> 01:54:04,395
AND AS YOU SAY, IF A SALESMAN
OR SOMEBODY WERE JEALOUS,

2332
01:54:04,895 --> 01:54:07,898
THEY COULD BE DOWNRIGHT
LIES, NOW, COULDN'T THEY?

2333
01:54:08,399 --> 01:54:09,400
WHAT COULD?

2335
01:54:11,402 --> 01:54:12,403
WHY, OF COURSE!

2336
01:54:12,903 --> 01:54:13,904
IT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU

2337
01:54:13,904 --> 01:54:15,906
YOU SHOULD NEVER BELIEVE
EVERYTHING YOU HEAR.

2338
01:54:16,407 --> 01:54:19,410
I MEAN, IF YOU'D
JUST DISCUSS THINGS!

2339
01:54:19,910 --> 01:54:21,912
I WOULD BE DELIGHTED
TO DISCUSS

2340
01:54:21,912 --> 01:54:25,416

YOUR KNEES BEND?

2344
01:54:32,123 --> 01:54:35,126
WE COULD SIT
ON THE STEPS.

2345
01:54:35,126 --> 01:54:38,129
WE COULD ALSO
SIT ON A LOG

01:54:38,129 --> 01:54:40,631
AT THE FOOTBRIDGE.

2347
01:54:40,631 --> 01:54:44,635
NO. I COULDN'T DO THAT.

2348
01:54:44,635 --> 01:54:46,137
I'VE NEVER BEEN TO
THE FOOTBRIDGE WITH A MAN

2349
01:54:46,137 --> 01:54:47,138
IN MY LIFE.

2350
01:54:47,138 --> 01:54:49,140
JUST TO TALK.

2351
01:54:49,140 --> 01:54:52,143
I HAVE TO DRESS
FOR THE SOCIABLE.

2352
01:54:56,147 --> 01:54:59,150
THEN MEET ME THERE
IN 15 MINUTES.

2353
01:54:59,150 --> 01:55:01,652
OH, NO, I--I CAN'T.

2354
01:55:01,652 --> 01:55:03,154
PLEASE.

2355
01:55:03,154 --> 01:55:05,156
SOME OTHER TIME.

2356
01:55:05,156 --> 01:55:07,158
MAYBE TOMORROW.

2357
01:55:07,658 --> 01:55:10,661
PLEASE.

2358
01:55:10,661 --> 01:55:13,164
OH, MY DEAR
LITTLE LIBRARIAN,

2359
01:55:13,164 --> 01:55:15,666
YOU PILE UP
ENOUGH TOMORROWS,

2360
01:55:15,666 --> 01:55:18,669
AND YOU'LL FIND YOU'VE
COLLECTED NOTHING

2361
01:55:18,669 --> 01:55:21,172
BUT A LOT OF
EMPTY YESTERDAYS.

2362
01:55:21,672 --> 01:55:25,176
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,

2363
01:55:25,176 --> 01:55:28,679

OHH.

2365
01:55:33,184 --> 01:55:35,686

01:56:13,724 --> 01:56:14,725
WHAT?

2371
01:56:14,725 --> 01:56:17,228
I JUST TOLD THE PROFESSOR

2372
01:56:17,228 --> 01:56:19,230
I'D MEET HIM
AT THE FOOTBRIDGE.

2373

02:05:25,943 --> 02:05:27,444
YOU SAID 15 MINUTES.

2493
02:05:27,444 --> 02:05:29,947

THAT KIND OF LATE.

02:09:24,147 --> 02:09:25,148
EXCUSE ME.

2545
02:09:25,649 --> 02:09:28,652
I'M EXPECTING A TELEGRAM
FROM RUDI FRIML.

2546
02:09:29,152 --> 02:09:31,154
THIS COULD BE IT.

2547
02:09:36,159 --> 02:09:37,994
SAY, WHO'S THE SALESMAN
AROUND HERE?

2548
02:09:37,994 --> 02:09:39,996
LOOKS LIKE SHE'S SELLING,
AND YOU'RE BUYING.

2549
02:09:39,996 --> 02:09:42,499
I TOLD YOU I HAD
TO KEEP HER OFF BALANCE.

2550
02:09:42,499 --> 02:09:44,000
YEAH. SHE'S SO
OFF BALANCE NOW

2551
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,002
YOU CAN'T TELL HER FROM
A CATBOAT IN A HURRICANE.

2552
02:09:46,002 --> 02:09:47,003
I GOT TO KEEP HER
THAT WAY

2553
02:09:47,504 --> 02:09:48,505
UNTIL THOSE UNIFORMS
ARRIVE.

2554
02:09:48,505 --> 02:09:50,507
THEY'RE HERE,
AND THE KIDS ARE IN THEM.

2555
02:09:50,507 --> 02:09:53,510
TOMMY PASSED OUT UNIFORMS AND
COLLECTED MOST OF THE MONEY.

2556
02:09:53,510 --> 02:09:56,012
NOW HE'S TRYING TO KEEP
THE KIDS TOGETHER,

2557
02:09:56,012 --> 02:09:58,014
PRETENDING THERE'S
A BAND PRACTICE

2558
02:09:58,014 --> 02:09:59,015
DOWN AT THE LUMBER YARD.

2559
02:09:59,015 --> 02:10:00,517
WHAT TIME DOES
THE FREIGHT TRAIN GO?

2560
02:10:01,017 --> 02:10:02,018
9:4O.

2561
02:10:02,519 --> 02:10:04,521
IT ISN'T EVEN
8:3O YET.

2562
02:10:04,521 --> 02:10:07,023
LISTEN, YOU BETTER
CHEESE IT NOW WHILE YOU CAN.

2563
02:10:07,023 --> 02:10:09,025
LISTEN, I CAME UP
THROUGH THE RANKS

2564
02:10:09,526 --> 02:10:10,527
ON THIS SKIRMISH,

2565
02:10:10,527 --> 02:10:12,028
AND I'M NOT RESIGNING
WITHOUT MY COMMISSION.

2566
02:10:12,028 --> 02:10:14,531
NOW GO ON. BEAT IT.

2567
02:10:17,033 --> 02:10:21,538
NEVER A PEACEFUL MOMENT
IN THE MUSIC BUSINESS.

2568
02:10:23,039 --> 02:10:25,041
NOW, WHERE WERE WE?

2569
02:10:25,041 --> 02:10:27,544
YOU WERE GOING TO
TELL ME

2570
02:10:28,044 --> 02:10:30,046
WHAT I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU.

2571
02:10:30,547 --> 02:10:33,550
YEAH. WE DON'T HAVE TO
GO INTO THAT RIGHT NOW,

2572
02:10:34,050 --> 02:10:35,552
DO WE?

2573
02:10:36,052 --> 02:10:38,555
OF COURSE NOT.

2574
02:10:39,055 --> 02:10:41,558
WE NEVER HAVE TO
GO INTO THAT, HAROLD.

2575
02:10:42,058 --> 02:10:43,059
MADAM LIBRARIAN,

2576
02:10:43,059 --> 02:10:46,062
YOU ARE A LADY
FROM THE GROUND UP.

2577
02:10:46,062 --> 02:10:48,064
THE LIBRARIAN
HASN'T FELT MUCH

2578
02:10:48,064 --> 02:10:50,567
LIKE DOING
RESEARCH LATELY.

2579
02:10:50,567 --> 02:10:54,070
BUT SHE DID PLENTY OF IT
WHEN YOU FIRST CAME HERE.

2580
02:10:54,070 --> 02:10:55,572
OH?

2581
02:10:55,572 --> 02:10:57,073
ABOUT WHAT?

2582
02:10:57,574 --> 02:10:59,576
OH, ABOUT

GARY CONSERVATORY

2587
02:11:12,088 --> 02:11:13,089
WELL, THERE MOST--

2588
02:11:13,089 --> 02:11:17,093
BECAUSE THE TOWN
WASN'T BUILT UNTIL 'O6.

2589
02:11:19,095 --> 02:11:21,097
COME ON, WALK ME HOME.

2590
02:11:21,097 --> 02:11:24,100
I HAVE TO GET SOMETHING

NOW I GIVE IT TO YOU
WITH ALL MY HEART.

2596
02:11:43,119 --> 02:11:46,122

HE'S PUTTING THE SHAKE
ON YOU!

2614
02:12:51,888 --> 02:12:52,889
HE'S TAKING OUT
YOUR EYE TEETH

2615
02:12:52,889 --> 02:12:55,392
WHILE YOU'RE LOOKING
THE OTHER WAY!

2616
02:12:55,392 --> 02:12:56,893
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO SAY, MISTER?

2617
02:12:56,893 --> 02:12:59,396
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I'M SAYING!

2618
02:12:59,396 --> 02:13:00,897
THERE'S BURGLARS
IN THE BEDROOM

2619
02:13:00,897 --> 02:13:03,900
WHILE YOU'RE FIDDLING
IN THE PARLOR!

2620

WHO'S BEDROOM ARE
THE BURGLARS FIDDLING IN?

2621
02:13:06,903 --> 02:13:07,904
QUIET.

2622
02:13:07,904 --> 02:13:09,906
I'M TALKING
ABOUT HAROLD HILL--

2623
02:13:10,407 --> 02:13:11,408
A SHELL WORKER,

2624
02:13:11,408 --> 02:13:14,911
A FLIMFLAMMER,
AN 18-KARAT THIEF!

2625
02:13:15,412 --> 02:13:16,913
YOU MEAN
THE MUSIC PROFESSOR?

2626
02:13:16,913 --> 02:13:18,415
MUSIC PROFESSOR?

2627
02:13:18,415 --> 02:13:21,918
NOT ON YOUR FIRELESS
COOKER, MISTER!

2628
02:13:21,918 --> 02:13:23,420
FELLOW THAT
ORGANIZED THE BAND?

2629
02:13:23,420 --> 02:13:24,921
THERE AIN'T
ANY BAND.

2630
02:13:24,921 --> 02:13:25,922
THERE AIN'T NEVER
BEEN A BAND!

2631
02:13:26,423 --> 02:13:28,425
THERE AIN'T NEVER
GONNA BE A BAND!

2632
02:13:28,925 --> 02:13:30,927
AND UNLESS YOU HUNT
THIS MAN DOWN RIGHT NOW

2633
02:13:30,927 --> 02:13:32,429
LIKE A MAD DOG,

2634
02:13:32,429 --> 02:13:33,930
THERE AIN'T GONNA BE
A HAROLD HILL, EITHER!

2635
02:13:33,930 --> 02:13:36,433
HE'LL BE ON HIS WAY
TO THE STATE LINE!

2636
02:13:36,433 --> 02:13:39,936
I SAID ALL ALONG,
GET HIS CREDENTIALS!

02:14:49,005 --> 02:14:51,007
HAVEN'T BEEN LOOKING

02:17:41,477 --> 02:17:43,479
I GOT THE FLIVVER
ALL CRANKED UP.

2671

2675
02:17:53,990 --> 02:17:55,491
YOU BETTER RUN,
PROFESSOR.

2676
02:17:55,491 --> 02:17:58,494
THEY'RE TALKING
ABOUT TAR AND FEATHERS.

2677
02:17:58,494 --> 02:18:00,496

IT'S NOT OFTEN
I FIND MYSELF

2681
02:18:11,507 --> 02:18:12,508
AT A LOSS FOR WORDS, BUT--

2682
02:18:12,508 --> 02:18:14,510
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT?

2683
02:18:14,510 --> 02:18:17,513
YOU DON'T OWE ME
A WORD--NOT A WORD.

2684
02:18:17,513 --> 02:18:19,015
HURRY, PLEASE.

2685
02:18:20,516 --> 02:18:22,518

2686
02:18:24,520 --> 02:18:26,522
HARRY'S NOT

2688
02:18:34,030 --> 02:18:36,032
HOLD ON A MINUTE,
SON.

2689
02:18:36,032 --> 02:18:37,533
I'M NOT YOUR SON.
LEAVE ME GO!

2690
02:18:37,533 --> 02:18:39,535
NO. NOT UNTIL I TALK
TO YOU A MINUTE.

2691
02:18:39,535 --> 02:18:41,037
I WON'T LISTEN.

2692
02:18:41,037 --> 02:18:42,538
YOU WOULDN'T
TELL THE TRUTH, ANYWAY.

2693
02:18:42,538 --> 02:18:43,539
I WOULD, TOO.

2694
02:18:43,539 --> 02:18:45,041
WOULD NOT.
WOULD, TOO.

2695
02:18:45,041 --> 02:18:46,042
I'LL TELL YOU ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO KNOW.

2696
02:18:46,542 --> 02:18:49,045
CAN YOU LEAD A BAND?

2697
02:18:51,047 --> 02:18:52,548
NO.

2698
02:18:52,548 --> 02:18:55,051
ARE YOU A BIG LIAR?

2699
02:18:55,551 --> 02:18:56,052
YES.

2700
02:18:56,552 --> 02:18:58,554
ARE YOU A DIRTY,
ROTTEN CROOK?

2701
02:18:58,554 --> 02:18:59,555
YES.

2702
02:18:59,555 --> 02:19:01,057
LEAVE ME GO,
YOU BIG LIAR.

2703
02:19:01,057 --> 02:19:03,059
YOU WANTED THE TRUTH,
DIDN'T YOU?

2704
02:19:03,059 --> 02:19:05,061
LOOK, I'M BIGGER
THAN YOU ARE,

2705
02:19:05,061 --> 02:19:06,062
AND YOU'RE GOING TO
STAND THERE AND GET IT ALL,

2706
02:19:06,062 --> 02:19:08,064
SO JUST STOP WIGGLING.

2707
02:19:08,064 --> 02:19:10,066
NOW, THERE ARE
2 THINGS

2708
02:19:10,566 --> 02:19:12,568
YOU'RE ENTITLED
TO KNOW.

2709
02:19:13,069 --> 02:19:15,571
ONE, YOU'RE
A WONDERFUL KID.

2710
02:19:15,571 --> 02:19:17,073
I THOUGHT SO
FROM THE FIRST.

2711
02:19:17,073 --> 02:19:18,074
THAT'S WHY I WANTED YOU
IN THE BAND,

2712
