Hello, Dad.

548
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,834
I tried to stop him moving in.

still on the poor old 1930s, surely.

555
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:30,974
It was a terrible time to be young.

556
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,810
Poverty. Unemployment.

562
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,448
Come on, Dad,
you're toughening it up a little, aren't you?

563

You and Ma look like you were having
a good time in these snaps.

You should get out more often.

What do you hang around this dump for?

570

574

1117
01:01:20,585 --> 01:01:24,531
Suze and I only saw each other
in the smart magazines.

1118
01:01:24,631 --> 01:01:26,533
At least she could
follow my meteoric career

1119
01:01:26,633 --> 01:01:29,160
as a professional teenager.

1120
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:31,871
She must've known
I was only doing it for her,

1121
01:01:31,971 --> 01:01:35,625
so she wouldn't have to
slip into that world completely alone.

1122

"From now on," I said,

1123

and a very practical boy."

to let go and sell out,

1130
01:01:53,785 --> 01:01:56,730
Money to catch Suzette when she falls.

1131
01:01:56,830 --> 01:01:58,898
And she's gonna fall.

1132
01:01:58,998 --> 01:02:00,466

01:39:39,674 --> 01:39:41,701
This is no ordinary year

1785
01:39:41,801 --> 01:39:42,910
Why not?

1786
01:39:43,010 --> 01:39:45,121
Let me explain it

1787
01:39:45,221 --> 01:39:46,330
ALL: Why not?

1788
01:39:46,430 --> 01:39:48,666
There were race riots in the streets

1789
01:39:48,766 --> 01:39:49,750
ALL: So what?

1790
01:39:49,850 --> 01:39:51,961
In the longest, hottest summer

1791
01:39:52,061 --> 01:39:53,129
So hot

1792
01:39:53,229 --> 01:39:55,339
Stirred up by ignorance and hate

1793
01:39:55,439 --> 01:39:56,632
So what?

1794
01:39:56,732 --> 01:39:58,676
And indecent people

1795
01:39:58,776 --> 01:39:59,844
So what?

1796
01:39:59,944 --> 01:40:02,618
I had to fight like me be mad

1797
01:40:16,001 --> 01:40:18,299
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

1798
01:40:19,088 --> 01:40:21,887
Ba-ba-ba, ooh

1799
01:40:23,342 --> 01:40:26,016
Ba-ba-ba, ooh

1800
01:40:27,471 --> 01:40:29,894
Ba-ba-ba, ooh

1801
01:40:31,642 --> 01:40:34,191
Ba-ba-ba, ooh

1802
01:40:35,896 --> 01:40:38,399
I've nothing much to offer

1803
01:40:44,363 --> 01:40:46,832
There's nothing much to take

1804
01:40:52,621 --> 01:40:54,874
I'm an absolute beginner

1805
01:41:01,172 --> 01:41:03,675
But I'm absolutely sane

1806
01:41:09,555 --> 01:41:11,933
As long as we're together

1807
01:41:17,980 --> 01:41:20,699
The rest can go to hell

1808
01:41:26,405 --> 01:41:28,533
I absolutely love you

1809
01:41:34,455 --> 01:41:36,958
But we're absolute beginners

1810
01:41:43,255 --> 01:41:46,304
With eyes completely open

1811
01:41:47,426 --> 01:41:49,053
Finders, keepers.

1812
01:41:51,347 --> 01:41:54,959
But nervous all the same

1813
01:41:55,059 --> 01:41:59,547
If our love song

1814
01:41:59,647 --> 01:42:04,009
Could fly over mountains

1815
01:42:04,109 --> 01:42:08,305
Could laugh at the ocean

1816
01:42:08,405 --> 01:42:11,726
Just like the films

1817
01:42:11,826 --> 01:42:16,522
There's no reason

1818
01:42:16,622 --> 01:42:20,735
To feel all the hard times

1819
01:42:20,835 --> 01:42:24,989
To lay down the hard lines

1820
01:42:25,089 --> 01:42:29,493
It's absolutely true

1821
01:42:29,593 --> 01:42:32,517
Ba-ba-ba, ooh

1822
01:42:33,764 --> 01:42:36,938
Ba-ba-ba, ooh

1823

Ba-ba-ba, ooh

1824
01:42:41,897 --> 01:42:44,946
Ba-ba-ba, ooh

1825
01:42:47,194 --> 01:42:49,117
I just can't believe it.

1826
01:42:50,489 --> 01:42:52,057
It's the most incredible thing

1827
01:42:52,157 --> 01:42:54,455
that's ever happened to me.

1828

(WHIMPERS)

1829
01:42:57,246 --> 01:42:58,856
It'll ruin his career.

1830
01:42:58,956 --> 01:43:01,334
Nothing much could happen

1831
01:43:07,673 --> 01:43:09,971
Nothing we can't shake

1832
01:43:15,514 --> 01:43:18,108
Well, we're absolute beginners

1833
01:43:24,189 --> 01:43:26,658
With nothing much at stake

1834
01:43:32,656 --> 01:43:35,660
As long as you're still smiling

1835
01:43:41,081 --> 01:43:43,584
There's nothing more I need

1836
01:43:49,506 --> 01:43:52,180
I absolutely love you

1837
01:43:57,598 --> 01:44:00,021
But we're absolute beginners

1838
01:44:05,981 --> 01:44:08,404
But if my love is your love

1839
01:44:14,657 --> 01:44:18,018
We're certain to succeed

1840
01:44:18,118 --> 01:44:22,898
If our love song

1841
01:44:22,998 --> 01:44:26,944
Could fly over mountains

1842
01:44:27,044 --> 01:44:31,490
Could sail over heartache

1843
01:44:31,590 --> 01:44:34,785
Just like the films

1844
01:44:34,885 --> 01:44:38,606
If there's reason

1845
01:44:39,682 --> 01:44:43,752
To feel all the hard times

1846
01:44:43,852 --> 01:44:48,007
To lay down the hard lines

1847
01:44:48,107 --> 01:44:51,327
