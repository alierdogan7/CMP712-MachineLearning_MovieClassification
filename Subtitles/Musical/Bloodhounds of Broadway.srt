<i>- Hey, what's those?</i>
- Bloodhound dogs. They're hers.

487
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,466
Bloodhounds?
Oh, no.

488
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:36,731
I'll play mother to the kid,
but there won't be no dog act in this show.

489
00:32:36,804 --> 00:32:39,466
- See? What'd I tell you?
- Don't worry about the dogs, Tessie.

490
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,474
- Poorly'll take care of them.
- Me?

491
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:44,340
<i>- Every day.</i>
- He will?

492
00:32:44,412 --> 00:32:46,642
- They love him.
- They don't love me. They love my pills.

493
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,648
- Now look, Numbers-
- Stop arguing. They're your department.

494
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,775
I only hope he's allergic to 'em.

495
00:32:50,852 --> 00:32:53,650
Fix her up, Tess.
Spend all you want. Deal?

496
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:57,248
Deal. So get yourself over to the Dude's.
I'll get the kid set and catch you later.

497
00:32:57,325 --> 00:32:58,724
Am I gonna see y'all?

498
00:32:58,793 --> 00:33:01,421
Why, sure.
Now do everything Tessie tells you.

499
00:33:01,496 --> 00:33:05,227
Yes, sir. And don't you fret none,
'cause I won't be a worry.

500
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:09,669
Hey, remember, you.
Your friends'll need walkin' twice a day or more.

501
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,728
In the rain too!

502
00:33:13,107 --> 00:33:15,098
[Barks]

503
00:33:16,811 --> 00:33:18,802
Just what I needed.

504
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,686
- Good to see you, Numbers.
- Good to see you, Dave.

505
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:36,787
- Greetings!
- Hey, Philo! We missed you!

506
00:33:36,864 --> 00:33:38,798
- Darling!
- Wait'll you see what we've done.

507
00:33:38,866 --> 00:33:40,800
And it's such a setup.
Wait'll you see it.

508
00:33:40,868 --> 00:33:42,802
A thing of beauty.
Safe like a bank.

509
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,804
Right next to an undertaker's store.

510
00:33:44,872 --> 00:33:46,806
- We all wear uniforms like citizens.
- All right already! All right!

511
00:33:46,874 --> 00:33:48,808
Why don't you leave us
alone for a minute?

512
00:33:48,876 --> 00:33:51,242
Hey, easy, baby.
Easy. Relax.

513
00:33:51,312 --> 00:33:53,712
Now, you were great.
You did fine with that testimony.

514
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,079
- Honest? Did you think I was good?
- We ain't in Cuba.

515
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:59,677
Don't even mention that place.
Why do you think I was so nervous on the stand?

516
00:33:59,754 --> 00:34:03,281
I know what those Cuban-type
muchacha girls look like.

517
00:34:03,358 --> 00:34:05,553
I want you right here.

518
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:08,891
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.
I got this for you in Miami for coming through.

519
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,794
- Here you are. Try it on for size.
- Numbers!

520
00:34:10,865 --> 00:34:13,834
- Everything's okay, huh?
- The heat's on a little, but we're doin' great.

521
00:34:13,901 --> 00:34:16,267
- Such action you never saw.
- The play is bigger than before.

522
00:34:16,337 --> 00:34:19,170
After we get set up, the first call comes in.
A three-horse parlay.

523
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,676
- My bet for a <i>C-</i> note.
- He blew it and give us another marker, okay?

524
00:34:22,744 --> 00:34:25,542
What do you mean, okay?
He don't owe us. We owe him.

525
00:34:25,613 --> 00:34:27,478
- That's all right, Numbers. Glad to help.
- Glad nothin'.

526
00:34:27,548 --> 00:34:29,482
That don't pay off, but I do always.

527
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,950
Scratch him off the books, Poorly.
Give him a grand too.

528
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,955
I'll give you some advice, Charlie.
Put it in the bank, kid, not on the ponies.

529
00:34:35,023 --> 00:34:36,957
- You can't beat 'em.
- Oh, darling!

530
00:34:37,025 --> 00:34:40,586
- Look, everybody! Give a look!
<i>- Did you buy that on time too, Numbers?</i>

531
00:34:43,064 --> 00:34:46,158
My, don't we all look healthy, huh?
All nice and tan.

532
00:34:46,234 --> 00:34:49,692
Been fishin'? Hey, how much you
pay down on that? How much a week?

533
00:34:49,771 --> 00:34:52,968
By the way, Inspector McNamara,
how's your stomach illness these days?

534
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:56,602
It's been real fine, Poorly, up to now.
You wanna know something?

535
00:34:56,677 --> 00:35:00,374
I was hoping maybe you'd stay away,
maybe you'd learned.

536
00:35:00,448 --> 00:35:03,440
- I guess not, huh?
- I'm clean, Mac.

537
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,486
Is that the Oscar Yvonne won?

538
00:35:05,553 --> 00:35:09,011
Hey, you wanna take
the tin badge off...

539
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:12,617
go outside maybe, like old times?

540
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:15,526
I'd like to, boy, but I can't stay.

541
00:35:15,596 --> 00:35:18,292
I'm busy.
Got myself a new job.

542
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,391
Pounding a beat in the Bronx?

543
00:35:20,468 --> 00:35:24,268
No, no. This may surprise you,
but the governor...

544
00:35:24,338 --> 00:35:27,671
was a little disappointed with what
the last crime committee didn't find out.

545
00:35:27,742 --> 00:35:30,711
- So?
- So he's appointed a whole new crime committee.

546
00:35:30,778 --> 00:35:33,178
Gonna have another hearing
next month.

547
00:35:33,247 --> 00:35:35,977
It's gonna be my job
to supply the witnesses.

548
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,577
- That's pretty funny, huh?
- Yeah, that's a very funny joke, Mac.

549
00:35:39,654 --> 00:35:43,317
Yeah. I thought you'd appreciate it.

550
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:47,225
That's why I wanted you
to be the first to hear it.

551
00:35:47,295 --> 00:35:49,229
<i>[Numbers]</i>
<i>Hey, Mac, wait.</i>

552
00:35:49,297 --> 00:35:53,063
Like they say in Georgia, it ain't fittin'
to let folks leave without eatin'.

553
00:35:53,134 --> 00:35:55,466
<i>Here.</i>

554
00:35:55,536 --> 00:35:58,994
You oughta travel more.
It improves you.

555
00:36:00,141 --> 00:36:02,200
[Apple Crunching]

556
00:36:02,276 --> 00:36:04,471
All right, you heard him.
It ain't the old malarkey either.

557
00:36:04,545 --> 00:36:07,480
From now on, he'll be close by looking
for any angle, waiting for any slip.

558
00:36:07,548 --> 00:36:09,743
We get caught smokin' in the subway even,
it'll come up trouble.

559
00:36:09,817 --> 00:36:11,944
- We'll be careful, Numbers.
<i>- Careful ain't enough. He's too smart.

560
00:36:12,019 --> 00:36:13,953
We gotta check, double check
and triple check!

561
00:36:14,021 --> 00:36:16,683
If there's anything to cover up,
we better do it fast <i>now!</i>

562
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,247
<i>[Apple Crunching]</i>

563
00:36:24,832 --> 00:36:28,632
Hello, McNamara.
Bye.

564
00:36:28,703 --> 00:36:32,400
Look, just take no chances. Do as you're told
and there won't be any trouble, see?

565
00:36:32,473 --> 00:36:35,169
- Hey, could he make any trouble
about the little doll?
- No!

566
00:36:35,243 --> 00:36:37,905
- What little doll?
- Emily Ann Stackerlee. He's nuts.

567
00:36:37,979 --> 00:36:39,913
Hey, wait a minute.
I don't get it.

568
00:36:39,981 --> 00:36:42,449
Look, this party's a child.
You know, like a kid sister.

569
00:36:42,517 --> 00:36:45,953
We brought her from Georgia so's I could
send her to school and watch out for her.

570
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:49,080
- But why, all of a sudden?
- Because she saved our lives, that's why.

571
00:36:49,157 --> 00:36:52,490
You oughta see her. She never cries.
She ain't scared of nothin'.

572
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,792
There's these three guys down there this big,
see, and with cannons this big.

573
00:36:56,864 --> 00:37:00,231
- And there's this little doll like this, and-
<i>- [Door Opens]</i>

574
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,269
The little doll.

575
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:05,100
Hey, don't you two guys
know what's playing?

576
00:37:05,173 --> 00:37:09,633
- Little doll, my eye.
Emily Ann here's a grown mouse.
- Howdy, all.

577
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:12,736
Kid sister, huh?

578
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,804
What else is new?

579
00:37:14,882 --> 00:37:18,477
But she was barefooted
with-with pigtails.

580
00:37:18,553 --> 00:37:21,750
<i>- We thought she was a filly.</i>
- So did I, but I asked her.

581
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,813
<i>She's 20.</i>

582
00:37:26,394 --> 00:37:28,453
- Did you pass McNamara on the way in?
- Yeah.

583
00:37:28,529 --> 00:37:33,057
- Did he see her?
- How could he miss her?

584
00:37:33,134 --> 00:37:36,160
We'll wait outside.
<i>Come on, honey.

585
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:44,606
She could make Inspector McNamara
a very happy man.

586
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,341
- What are you talking about?
- She's under 21.

587
00:37:47,415 --> 00:37:49,349
You brought her here from Georgia.
That's all.

588
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:52,011
I had to bring her. I told you why.
She can't go home.

589
00:37:52,086 --> 00:37:54,919
- They're after her down there for saving us.
- So she can't go someplace else?

590
00:37:54,989 --> 00:37:57,822
- Where, tell me?
- I can think of someplace.

591
00:37:59,594 --> 00:38:02,085
If I could figure something
legitimate for her to do...

592
00:38:02,163 --> 00:38:04,927
she'll be just like a million other dolls
in New York.

593
00:38:07,268 --> 00:38:09,668
Emily Ann.

594
00:38:09,737 --> 00:38:13,673
All of us want you to know that we're glad
you're here, and you're welcome to stay.

595
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:17,302
Oh, thank you.
I was gettin' powerful worried.

596
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,403
But we gotta figure something
legitimate for you to do...

597
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,414
<i>something that'll make you happy.</i>

598
00:38:21,482 --> 00:38:24,974
- Only it's gotta be legal.
- Well, I can sew and cook.

599
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,782
And I can chop wood,
and I plant cotton read good.

600
00:38:27,855 --> 00:38:29,823
Feel!

601
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,451
<i>Look, there's no wood to chop here,</i>
<i>and for us It Isn't Important to cook or sew.</i>

602
00:38:33,527 --> 00:38:36,928
- Well, what do girls do up here?
- They don't plant cotton.

603
00:38:36,998 --> 00:38:39,626
<i>Well, what about my dogs?</i>

604
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,861
They're awful good
at huntin' and treein'.

605
00:38:41,936 --> 00:38:45,565
<i>Chasin' things up trees like squirrels
and possums, even people.

606
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,108
<i>I hired 'em out to the sherlff lots.</i>

607
00:38:48,175 --> 00:38:50,643
Honey, I'm afraid you'd
be out of work somewhat.

608
00:38:50,711 --> 00:38:53,407
You see, there ain't many of
the old trees around anymore.

609
00:38:53,481 --> 00:38:56,143
- Didn't you say she can sing?
- So what?

610
00:38:56,217 --> 00:38:58,151
I don't do that too good,
Miss Tessie.

611
00:38:58,219 --> 00:39:00,983
Honey, with your looks and that build,
who's gonna listen?

612
00:39:01,055 --> 00:39:03,046
You'd be great,
and you can rehearse right here too.

613
00:39:03,124 --> 00:39:06,958
- Why not?
- Yeah. Why not? Sounds okay, huh?

614
00:39:07,028 --> 00:39:10,122
Don't ask me.
I'm just an innocent bystander.

615
00:39:10,197 --> 00:39:13,291
Okay, it's all set.
<i>Charlie!

616
00:39:13,367 --> 00:39:16,063
Hey, Curtaintime Charlie!
He'll train you, see?

617
00:39:16,137 --> 00:39:19,368
When you're ready, we clock you for the Dude
and you're off on a fast track.

618
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,601
- You want me, Numbers?
- Yeah. Meet Emily Ann Stackerlee, kid.

619
00:39:21,676 --> 00:39:23,906
- Dream up a classy act for her.
- She sing?

620
00:39:23,978 --> 00:39:25,570
- Beautiful.
- Dance?

621
00:39:25,646 --> 00:39:28,376
- I used to jig with my grandpap.
- Jig? Oh, no.

622
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,509
That went out with
high-button shoes.

623
00:39:31,585 --> 00:39:34,452
You know somethin'?
High-button shoes are coming back again.

624
00:39:34,522 --> 00:39:36,547
Okay, meet me here

- Thank you, <i>Mr.</i> Curtaintime.
- Tessie'll show you around, Emily Ann.

626
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,452
Okay, fellas, that's it.

627
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:46,194
<i>- Darling?</i>
- Yeah?

00:39:46,267 --> 00:39:49,566
- I know why you're doing this, only-
- Only what?

629
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:53,767
Only I saved you from that committee
for one reason- me.

630
00:39:57,912 --> 00:40:00,779
Okay, let's get goin'.

631
00:40:00,848 --> 00:40:02,873
- Good morning, Charlie.
- Good morning, <i>Mr.</i> Curtaintime.

Hi. Now here's how we'll start.

633
00:40:05,252 --> 00:40:07,413
- Tessie'll do a very simple step.
- Who, me?

634
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:11,982
- You. You do everything she does
and see if you can follow.
- Yes, sir.

- Well, you were just fine, <i>Mr.</i> Curtaintime.

639
00:41:11,485 --> 00:41:13,919
Now can I show you a little step
my grandpappy taught me?

640

you're really in business.

Miss Yvonne, it ain't so.

01:08:57,912 --> 01:09:00,073
I didn't kiss him
to make him want me.

1026
01:09:00,147 --> 01:09:03,014

awful things about hisself.

Oh, darling, darling.

1118
01:14:33,651 --> 01:14:37,052
I been waiting to hear from you.
Are you all right? Can I see you?

1119
01:14:37,121 --> 01:14:41,421
Easy, baby, easy. I'm fine, honest.
There's nothing to worry about.

1120
01:14:41,492 --> 01:14:45,690
I can't help it. It's almost tomorrow.
What are you gonna do?

1121
01:14:45,763 --> 01:14:49,324
What I'm doing right now: I'll just sit tight.
So will you stop worrying?

1122
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:51,800
Yvonne might only be bluffing
just to get me back.

1123
01:14:51,869 --> 01:14:55,066
Yeah. Hey, you still wanna marry me?

1124
01:14:55,139 --> 01:14:58,540
Oh, yes, of course I do.
But what if she does tell on you?

1125
01:14:58,609 --> 01:15:02,067
I'm ready for that too. There's a tramp steamer
leaving at noon tomorrow.

1126
01:15:02,146 --> 01:15:05,377
- A guy I know's the captain.
If I have to, I'll be on it.
- Oh, no!

1127
01:15:05,450 --> 01:15:08,385
Baby, will you stop?
It'll be okay. I'll send for you.

1128
01:15:08,453 --> 01:15:11,115
Europe, South America maybe.
Yeah, we'll live like kings.

1129
01:15:11,189 --> 01:15:13,749
- I brought the loot right with me.
- How're the dogs?

1130
01:15:13,825 --> 01:15:16,988
- Listen, Poorly wants to know how the dogs are.
- Oh, Nip and Tuck?

1131
01:15:17,061 --> 01:15:19,291
<i>- [Knocking]</i>
- Tell him they're all right.

1132

You know something?
I love you, doll.

1133
01:15:22,633 --> 01:15:25,466
I've been missing you like I never missed
anybody else ever before.

1134
01:15:25,536 --> 01:15:27,936
Oh, darling.
I miss you too.

1135
01:15:28,005 --> 01:15:31,133
Why, Inspector McNamara.
<i>Come in.

1136
01:15:32,777 --> 01:15:35,211
<i>Come on in, Inspector McNamara.
<i>Come in.

1137
01:15:35,279 --> 01:15:38,942
Uh, hello, Fannie. Tessie.
How's Clarence?

1138
01:15:39,016 --> 01:15:41,041
- The cops are at Tessie's!
- Did you tell her where we were?

1139
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:43,110
No, but they can trace the call.
Let's go!

1140
01:15:43,187 --> 01:15:47,055
Yeah. And tell him to take
some bicarbonate, Fannie.

1141
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:50,424
Kiss the baby.
Bye.

1142
01:15:50,495 --> 01:15:54,989
- Was that Numbers on the phone?
- Numbers? What, are you crazy or something?

1143
01:15:55,066 --> 01:15:58,433
- Yes, sir, it was.
- What did he say?

1144
01:15:58,503 --> 01:16:01,836
- You don't have to tell him. You got rights.
- He said he loves me.

1145
01:16:01,906 --> 01:16:05,205
That's a good thing to know.
Very good.

1146
01:16:05,276 --> 01:16:07,403
So now you know.
So go already.

1147
01:16:07,478 --> 01:16:10,538
You love him too, don't you?

1148
01:16:10,615 --> 01:16:12,845
<i>- Want to help him?</i>
- Yes, sir, I do.

1149
01:16:12,917 --> 01:16:15,784
- So do I.
- Kid, he's a cop.

1150
01:16:15,853 --> 01:16:18,913
- I believe him, Tessie.
<i>- You can.</i>

1151
01:16:18,990 --> 01:16:23,450
You see, Numbers and I grew up
together in Hell's Kitchen.

1152
01:16:23,528 --> 01:16:26,622
We raided pushcarts together to eat.

1153
01:16:26,697 --> 01:16:29,427
Matter of fact, we even went
to the reform school together.

1154
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:34,164
When we got out, we-
Well, anyhow, I know him.

1155
01:16:34,238 --> 01:16:36,968
The kid's got a lot of good in him-
a whole lot.

1156
01:16:37,041 --> 01:16:39,566
<i>And with you to love him,</i>
<i>he can really straighten out.</i>

1157
01:16:39,644 --> 01:16:43,546
- He will. I know it.
<i>- Yeah, I'm banking on It too.</i>

1158
01:16:43,614 --> 01:16:45,548
Only...

1159
01:16:46,951 --> 01:16:50,614
he might have to pay a little-
maybe a year up the river.

1160
01:16:50,688 --> 01:16:53,054
A year.

1161
01:16:53,124 --> 01:16:55,115
That ain't long, is it?

1162
01:16:55,193 --> 01:16:57,593
Maybe it will be
to Numbers and Poorly.

1163
01:16:57,662 --> 01:17:00,358
I don't think they'll be very happy
being locked up so long.

1164
01:17:00,431 --> 01:17:03,559
<i>You think they'd rather</i>
<i>do five to 10, Tussle?</i>

1165
01:17:03,634 --> 01:17:07,866
Look, I just left Yvonne.
She's sore in spades.

1166
01:17:07,939 --> 01:17:09,930
So this is it.

1167
01:17:10,007 --> 01:17:13,204
Numbers has to be there tomorrow
before she testifies, or else.

1168
01:17:13,277 --> 01:17:16,735
lf'n he does, Mr. McNamara,
is that a promise?

1169
01:17:16,814 --> 01:17:18,805
<i>Only one year?</i>

1170
01:17:18,883 --> 01:17:21,044
Well, I think maybe
I can arrange it.

1172
01:17:23,988 --> 01:17:27,981
You see, the committee's interested in
the big-time operators- the syndicate.

1173
01:17:28,059 --> 01:17:31,586
Up to now, they haven't been able
to get close to 'em- no evidence.

1174
01:17:31,662 --> 01:17:34,358
Numbers talks,
it's our first big break.

~ [Resumes Melody,

1176
01:17:51,382 --> 01:17:56,752
Well, if he does decide to talk,
tell him to bring his books along, huh?

1177
01:17:56,821 --> 01:17:58,812
For proof.

1178
01:17:58,889 --> 01:18:02,052
<i>The meeting’s set for tomorrow at 100.</i>
<i>Yvonne won't be late.</i>

1179
01:18:02,126 --> 01:18:06,495
I hope he gets there first-
for your sake too.

1180
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:12,697
- Tessie, we've got to find him.
- Where did you say Numbers was calling from?

1181
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:15,398
He didn't say.
The Ouija board was right.

1182
01:18:15,473 --> 01:18:18,931
McGee drowned, and now they're going on a boat.
What're we gonna do, Tessie?

1183
01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:22,878
Find 'em! Where, I don't know.
It might take some time.

1184
01:18:22,947 --> 01:18:25,415
- First we better get Solly the Snatcher.
- Who's he?

1185
01:18:25,483 --> 01:18:27,508
Occasionally he kidnaps people.

1186
01:18:27,585 --> 01:18:31,885
I'll have him take Yvonne out of town for
a couple of days. We can't take any chances.

1187
01:18:31,956 --> 01:18:33,947
Hello, operator?

1188
01:18:34,025 --> 01:18:37,188
Oh, uh, just one more thing, Tessie.

1189
01:18:37,261 --> 01:18:39,923
Don't try any hipky-dripky
with Yvonne, huh?

1190
01:18:39,997 --> 01:18:42,090
We're having her place guarded.

1191
01:18:44,502 --> 01:18:46,060
- Find him, Tessie, find him!
- Yeah, yeah. Operator?

1192
01:18:47,538 --> 01:18:49,563
<i>[Tussle]</i>
<i>Well, so where'd you look next?</i>

<i>Yeah. You're sure?</i>

1194
01:18:51,676 --> 01:18:54,372
All right, all right.
Don't get sore.

1195
01:18:54,445 --> 01:18:57,972
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll be here.

1196
01:18:58,049 --> 01:19:01,075
8:00.
Only five hours left.

1197
01:19:01,152 --> 01:19:04,280
Still no dice. Nobody's seen him
or even heard from him yet.

1198
01:19:04,355 --> 01:19:06,585
- They hid out for real this time.
- If we could only-

1199
01:19:06,657 --> 01:19:10,093
Oh, how? You heard me
call Harry the Hack. He checked.

1200
01:19:10,161 --> 01:19:13,255
They didn't take cabs.
They hoofed it. Didn't leave no tracks.

1201
01:19:13,331 --> 01:19:15,663
We ain't playing with kids,
you know.

1202
01:19:17,301 --> 01:19:20,702
Look. Poorly's muffler.

1203

Go say I'm crazy, but so do I.

1207
01:19:31,549 --> 01:19:36,111
After Yvonne testifies,
we'll miss both of them for a long, long time.

01:19:36,187 --> 01:19:38,621
No! I'm not gonna let it happen!

- And you can start out fresh.

- So what?

1261
01:22:38,669 --> 01:22:42,935
Did he tell you how much I'd have left after I pay
the taxes? And what happens when I get out?

1262
01:22:43,007 --> 01:22:45,635
What do I do, shovel snow or hack cabs
or press pants maybe?

1263
01:22:45,709 --> 01:22:47,700
I wouldn't care, 'cause I love you.

1264
01:22:47,778 --> 01:22:51,009
- You love me, and you still want me to go to jail?
- It'll do you good.

1265
01:22:51,081 --> 01:22:55,677
- You'll come out honest.
- Yeah? Well, I'm not going to any jail.
I'm going on that boat.

1266
01:22:58,656 --> 01:23:02,490
- You coming or not?
- No, and if you go you'll drown.

1267
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:06,360

- The Ouija board. It came up ‘‘McGee."

~ They called him Jack O'Diamonds
on the riverboat route ~

1302
01:26:12,382 --> 01:26:16,409
~ He was the Jack O'Diamonds
'cause the jacks were his suit ~

1303
01:26:16,487 --> 01:26:20,890
~ It was spectacular to see
the way he was dressed ~

1304
01:26:20,958 --> 01:26:24,894
~ With diamonds big as buttons
popping out of his vest ~

1305
01:26:24,962 --> 01:26:27,453
~ With diamonds big as buttons
And you ought to see him struttin' ~

1306

~ With those diamonds
big as buttons popping out of his vest ~

1307
01:26:31,368 --> 01:26:35,395
~ He was the king of gamblers
and the kind of a guy ~

1308
01:26:35,472 --> 01:26:39,408
~ Who loved to bet a bundle
without battin' an eye ~

1309
01:26:39,476 --> 01:26:43,936
~ The gals affectionately
loved to hang on his neck ~

1310
01:26:44,014 --> 01:26:47,780
~ But Jack O'Diamonds's heart
was just as cold as his deck ~

1311

~ They loved to see him bettin'
and they loved to have him pettin' ~

~ But old Jack O'Diamonds's heart
was just as cold as his deck ~

~ One night the boat docked
in New Orleans ~

1314

~ And who came aboard ~

1315
01:27:00,631 --> 01:27:04,727
~ But Lily the flower of the South ~

1316
01:27:06,870 --> 01:27:10,670

and his heart was aflame ~

~ She smiled at Jack O'Diamonds
and suggested a game ~

~ He opened strong with jacks
but Lily didn't give beans ~

~ Displaying his celebrated art ~

it wasn't long until Lil ~

for nickels and dimes ~

~ And as the Mississippi
paddle wheeler departs ~

~ He's left without his glory ~
