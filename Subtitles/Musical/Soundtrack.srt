1
00:01:30,037 --> 00:01:32,737
Thousands arrive here to
shape their destiny

2
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,237
but only a fortunate handful
manage to make a mark.

3
00:01:36,277 --> 00:01:38,602
Raunak was destiny's cursed child

4
00:01:38,812 --> 00:01:41,046
but he still left a
lasting impression.

5
00:03:30,024 --> 00:03:34,093
You'll repent...

6
00:03:34,094 --> 00:03:39,093
you depart today...

7
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:44,369
when will you return?

8
00:03:44,738 --> 00:03:48,565
Will you return?

9
00:03:49,777 --> 00:03:52,978
Listen... son,
keep some change for the bus ride.

10
00:03:54,114 --> 00:03:57,008
Wow... you pull some wool
over the world's eye.

11
00:03:57,051 --> 00:03:58,511
You can see, right?

12
00:03:58,685 --> 00:04:01,385
No son... I was born blind.

13
00:04:01,922 --> 00:04:05,214
I can't see, but I can see.

14
00:04:18,772 --> 00:04:21,063
I always knew you'd show up someday.

15
00:04:21,308 --> 00:04:23,235
I've known Raunak since he was a kid.

16
00:04:24,178 --> 00:04:26,708
His father was like an
elder brother to me.

17
00:04:27,114 --> 00:04:28,981
He was also quite a
talented musician.

18
00:04:28,982 --> 00:04:32,683
He spent a lot of time in Bombay,
struggling... but...

19
00:04:33,654 --> 00:04:36,022
Mihika, I've come from so far
to play catch with you.

20
00:04:36,023 --> 00:04:37,223
Raunak, some water?

21
00:04:37,224 --> 00:04:41,119
Sure but...
- I'll be right back then.

22
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:43,688
Not neat... with a twist... please?

23
00:04:44,765 --> 00:04:49,331
I've walked so far, I definitely
want to down a Johnny Walker.

24
00:04:49,903 --> 00:04:52,433
Get the ice -Not for me.

25
00:04:52,873 --> 00:04:54,504
It ruins the taste of whiskey.

26
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:59,475
Hmm... it's been 20 years since
I drank before lunch.

27
00:05:00,147 --> 00:05:03,216
And it had to be a Kaul to
come change my ways again.

28
00:05:03,217 --> 00:05:05,075
It's never too late, Uncle.

29
00:05:05,886 --> 00:05:07,448
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

30
00:05:10,657 --> 00:05:12,948
Hmm...
your mom knows you're here right?

31
00:05:13,727 --> 00:05:15,085
Sorry?

32
00:05:16,897 --> 00:05:18,221
One more...

33
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,461
- Enough.
- Last.

34
00:05:24,905 --> 00:05:26,502
So, how about assisting me?

35
00:05:26,874 --> 00:05:31,372
Sure thing. - Just one question,
should I call you Uncle or Boss?

36
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,571
Here we are then,
welcome to my world.

37
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:40,716
Tango Charlie

38
00:05:41,855 --> 00:05:46,114
Charlie is the owner's name.
- And Tango?

39
00:05:47,194 --> 00:05:49,291
His split personality!

40
00:05:51,198 --> 00:05:54,058
You'll meet both of them
very soon, come. - Come.

41
00:06:01,141 --> 00:06:04,137
Conquer... conquer...

42
00:06:04,378 --> 00:06:07,670
Conquer... conquer...

43
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:14,251
Conquer... conquer...

44
00:06:14,254 --> 00:06:21,254
Conquer... conquer...

45
00:06:22,196 --> 00:06:24,555
I used to be a DJ at Tango
Charlie back then.

46
00:06:24,932 --> 00:06:27,333
In a way,
Raunak's journey begins there.

47
00:06:27,334 --> 00:06:30,535
The winds render open
many a blank pages...

48
00:06:33,974 --> 00:06:37,402
moments bitter-sweet,
ripe and sour are being revealed.

49
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:41,540
Actually we bonded over music.

50
00:06:42,015 --> 00:06:44,977
We'd be going on about music
for hours, over drinks.

51
00:06:45,786 --> 00:06:47,220
He drank a helluva lot.

52
00:06:47,221 --> 00:06:50,356
The winds render open
many a blank pages...

53
00:06:50,357 --> 00:06:54,260
moments bitter-sweet,
ripe and sour are being revealed.

54
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:56,329
We used to commute together
to and from the club.

55
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,364
Soon as he got home,
he'd plug into his headphones,

56
00:06:58,365 --> 00:07:00,666
and be making music on
his old computer.

57
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:06,530
I proceed to conquer time.

58
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,978
I proceed to conquer time.

59
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:14,213
I didn't think that
we'd have a third...

60
00:07:14,214 --> 00:07:16,175
wheel with us in the band,

61
00:07:16,283 --> 00:07:17,675
But he was cool.

62
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:20,049
He was that small town guy but,

63
00:07:22,222 --> 00:07:24,422
He adapted, blended in.

64
00:07:37,904 --> 00:07:40,906
We first met Raunak at the club,
right?

65
00:07:40,907 --> 00:07:44,404
Actually he dubbed us 'Tango
Charlie's Angels'

66
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:56,053
The eyes seek the advent of dawn,
I proceed...

67
00:07:57,057 --> 00:08:02,090
My intentions yearn
to taste trouble...

68
00:08:05,032 --> 00:08:07,664
I liked Raunak...
actually everyone liked him.

69
00:08:07,934 --> 00:08:10,269
He was just this really fun,
ballsy guy.

70
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,505
The eyes seek the advent of dawn,
I proceed...

71
00:08:13,573 --> 00:08:16,842
My intentions yearn
to taste trouble...

72
00:08:16,843 --> 00:08:20,179
Experience undermines
my courage but...

73
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,649
Behold!
My ambitions have grown wings!

74
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,952
Like a unique comforting
whiff of air...

75
00:08:26,953 --> 00:08:30,256
Like a unique comforting
whiff of air...

76
00:08:30,257 --> 00:08:32,684
I proceed...

77
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:36,195
to conquer time.

78
00:08:36,196 --> 00:08:40,800
Conquer... conquer...

79
00:08:40,801 --> 00:08:44,070
Conquer... conquer...

80
00:08:45,806 --> 00:08:49,269
Hey...
hero... what are you up to up there?

81
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:53,475
Come, let's have some tea, come...
come on.

82
00:08:56,883 --> 00:08:59,118
Your dad also used to drink
in the mornings.

83
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:01,921
He'd say, when you rise with a drink,

84
00:09:01,922 --> 00:09:04,056
It's anyone's take on how
high up he got in life,

85
00:09:04,057 --> 00:09:08,293
but he sure did manage to escape
it. - Now you come down, come on.

86
00:09:08,362 --> 00:09:11,460
Uncle, join me up here.
- Raunak, I said get down, NOW!

87
00:09:11,898 --> 00:09:13,563
Alright, fine fine...

88
00:09:14,034 --> 00:09:15,167
Easy easy easy...

89
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:17,629
Don't compare me to my father, Uncle.

90
00:09:20,073 --> 00:09:23,604
I'm Raunak Kaul, he was Parth Kaul.

91
00:09:26,113 --> 00:09:28,506
You're still peeved at him,
aren't you?

92
00:09:29,983 --> 00:09:31,648
He loved his music,

93
00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:34,181
So he left mom.

94
00:09:34,788 --> 00:09:36,146
Fair enough.

95
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,658
And who am I to complain?

96
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,727
I did the exact same thing, didn't I?

97
00:09:41,728 --> 00:09:43,495
Proved to her that I'm his son.

98
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,190
I left mom.

99
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:49,992
You even talk in the same phrases.

100
00:09:50,704 --> 00:09:53,666
And you talk like an old man.

101
00:09:55,342 --> 00:09:59,339
That I am...
old. All I have are memories.

102
00:10:00,046 --> 00:10:04,715
No dreams anymore.
That's for you youngsters.

103
00:10:05,252 --> 00:10:09,545
Spot on, Uncle. The dream
is what keeps me ticking.

104
00:10:09,856 --> 00:10:12,658
Easy Raunak...
watch it... - The dream...

105
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:15,291
Raunak! Raunak! Raunak!

106
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:21,660
I think I should sleep off now.

107
00:10:21,868 --> 00:10:23,726
Why? Already realized your dream?

108
00:10:24,037 --> 00:10:27,465
That I will Uncle,
take it in writing if you want.

109
00:10:27,974 --> 00:10:32,233
And even your booze buddy,
Parth Kaul,

110
00:10:33,113 --> 00:10:35,608
Will look down from
up there and say...

111
00:10:37,784 --> 00:10:39,312
I should sleep off now.

112
00:10:39,653 --> 00:10:41,454
Huh?
- Get me off this ledge, Uncle.

113
00:10:41,455 --> 00:10:43,289
Come on son, that's what I've
been trying to do all along.

114
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:47,583
Come on, let's go. - Uncle, if we
rise and drink, we get high.

115
00:10:48,195 --> 00:10:50,095
What if we get high and drink.

116
00:10:50,096 --> 00:10:52,364
Then that's where we'll end up,
son. Come on.

117
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:56,802
Daddy's here now, daddy's here now...

118
00:10:56,803 --> 00:10:59,872
Let's drink some scotch...
drink some scotch...

119
00:10:59,873 --> 00:11:01,240
Hey...
what are you singing Whiskey and...

120
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:03,042
Rye songs to my little angel for?

121
00:11:03,043 --> 00:11:04,367
Here, take this.

122
00:11:04,744 --> 00:11:06,136
What's this junk now?

123
00:11:06,413 --> 00:11:08,147
This is Parth Kaul's treasure chest.

124
00:11:08,148 --> 00:11:10,416
Some records, his recordings,
demo tapes... stuff like that.

125
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:12,378
- Father's?
- Hmm.

126
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:14,111
What do I do with it?

127
00:11:14,788 --> 00:11:17,579
Well, this is all he's left
behind. Your inheritance.

128
00:11:18,925 --> 00:11:23,184
Surinder Chacha,
I know all his tunes inside out.

129
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,664
Every time he made a new tune or
demo, he got it to me first.

130
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:26,866
This is useless for me.

131
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:29,902
But I thought Smriti didn't
let you meet him?

132
00:11:29,903 --> 00:11:32,467
We always found our ways around her.

133
00:11:34,774 --> 00:11:37,975
How was your mom okay with you
coming here to be a musician?

134
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:40,511
Seen me work out, Uncle?

135
00:11:41,848 --> 00:11:43,945
She's just too old to
match these muscles.

136
00:11:44,918 --> 00:11:46,515
Like father, like son.

137
00:12:50,884 --> 00:12:53,982
The singing sensation, Mak!

138
00:12:54,888 --> 00:12:58,457
Makarand.
He's got the voice of a...

139
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:02,194
prophet and he fits our budget.

140
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,592
As in, for free!

141
00:13:06,766 --> 00:13:08,734
You're such a cheapskate.

142
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,936
Your father respected a man's talent.

143
00:13:10,937 --> 00:13:13,137
Always rewarded his musicians well.

144
00:13:14,341 --> 00:13:17,132
And left me dusty tapes
as inheritance.

145
00:13:18,845 --> 00:13:21,136
Shall we give it a go then?

146
00:13:21,715 --> 00:13:28,045
One, two, three, four.

147
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,144
Guys!!!

148
00:14:29,783 --> 00:14:33,450
Sir... sir... it's dawn already.

149
00:14:33,987 --> 00:14:35,311
C'mon...

150
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,996
What a voice you have sir.
Here's your fee.

151
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:18,664
Set a deadline.

152
00:15:18,665 --> 00:15:20,694
I'll be back.

153
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:51,096
Raunak, where's Soni?

154
00:15:51,097 --> 00:15:52,955
Where's Soni?

155
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,294
Shonali!

156
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:24,329
Shonali! - Get out of my way,
Raunak! - Shonali!

157
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,798
Out of my way!

158
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:28,634
Let go! Let go!

159
00:16:28,635 --> 00:16:33,031
Leave him!

160
00:16:33,072 --> 00:16:34,239
The music stopped...

161
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,405
so I stepped out and what
do I see? Shonali...

162
00:16:36,643 --> 00:16:38,243
She always had anger
management issues,

163
00:16:38,244 --> 00:16:39,978
Is beating the nonsense
out of her boyfriend...

164
00:16:39,979 --> 00:16:41,980
in full public view.
- Sonic, stop it...

165
00:16:41,981 --> 00:16:45,284
stop it... bouncers... get
him off. Take him in.

166
00:16:45,285 --> 00:16:47,319
Man the console, get the console.

167
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,088
Shonali enough, enough...
stop it, stop it!

168
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:52,550
Just walk outside with me...
come on.

169
00:16:52,725 --> 00:16:56,017
- Stop it!
- I'm not doing anything.

170
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,254
Let me go.

171
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:08,229
And then this song came on,
Fakira, Fakira...

172
00:17:08,575 --> 00:17:10,968
I was like, what the Fakira man!

173
00:17:11,644 --> 00:17:18,644
Oh poor boy, it's a show, whether
it's wealth or poverty.

174
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:23,655
This is the method,
this is poverty...

175
00:17:23,656 --> 00:17:26,982
This is poverty...

176
00:17:28,661 --> 00:17:32,130
Groove, poor boy! Groove...

177
00:17:32,131 --> 00:17:35,267
Groove, poor boy! Groove...

178
00:17:35,268 --> 00:17:41,996
Groove, poor boy! Groove...

179
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:45,277
Groove, poor boy! Groove...

180
00:17:45,278 --> 00:17:48,080
Groove, poor boy! Groove...

181
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:51,578
Groove, poor boy! Groove...

182
00:17:57,423 --> 00:18:01,059
Groove, poor boy! Groove...

183
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:04,329
Groove, poor boy! Groove...

184
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,833
Groove, poor boy! Groove...

185
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:11,126
Groove, poor boy! Groove...

186
00:18:11,304 --> 00:18:14,630
I was there when he recorded that
song and never once imagined

187
00:18:14,707 --> 00:18:17,843
that it would play in a club and
people would trip out on it.

188
00:18:17,844 --> 00:18:20,510
What a lot of folks didn't know
was that his musical knowledge

189
00:18:20,947 --> 00:18:23,442
was profound.
Rock, jazz, Indian classical.

190
00:18:23,883 --> 00:18:26,048
His set went on long into that night.

191
00:18:27,053 --> 00:18:31,449
But I knew it right at the start,
Raunak had mojo, man.

192
00:18:31,925 --> 00:18:35,394
Oh poor boy, i'ts a show...

193
00:18:35,395 --> 00:18:38,730
whether it's wealth or poverty.

194
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:42,167
This is the method,
this is poverty...

195
00:18:42,168 --> 00:18:45,926
This is poverty...

196
00:18:46,973 --> 00:18:50,175
Groove, poor boy! Groove...

197
00:18:50,176 --> 00:18:53,912
Groove, poor boy! Groove...

198
00:18:53,913 --> 00:18:57,316
Groove, poor boy! Groove...

199
00:18:57,317 --> 00:19:00,484
Groove, poor boy! Groove...

200
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:04,556
Groove in ecstasy...

201
00:19:04,557 --> 00:19:07,726
Praise the lord...
praise the lord...

202
00:19:07,727 --> 00:19:11,263
Groove in ecstasy...

203
00:19:11,264 --> 00:19:14,556
Praise the lord...
praise the lord...

204
00:19:41,394 --> 00:19:45,998
Hey, your highness!
King of the turntables!

205
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:47,960
Welcome to Charlieland.

206
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:51,003
Gimme your hand, bro.
- You're a freaking rock star man.

207
00:19:51,004 --> 00:19:52,999
I'm your biggest fan
since last night.

208
00:19:53,072 --> 00:19:55,640
Here, check my facebook status.

209
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:57,009
There are DJs who play music...

210
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,643
and there are DJs who play the crowd.

211
00:19:58,644 --> 00:20:00,379
Last night I saw them both!
That's you, bro.

212
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,376
Read the comments,
read the comments. Bro.

213
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:07,613
You've got oodles of talent,
as did Parth Kaul.

214
00:20:08,054 --> 00:20:09,616
Oh don't look surprised.

215
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:11,113
I knew Parth.

216
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,718
I know everybody.

217
00:20:13,626 --> 00:20:17,054
But Parth didn't have the one
thing that you've got today!

218
00:20:19,432 --> 00:20:21,222
CHARLIE, bro!!!

219
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:25,231
I've got the blueprint
to your career.

220
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:28,306
I can get you the albums,
I can get you the concerts,

221
00:20:28,307 --> 00:20:29,775
I can get you the music videos,

222
00:20:29,776 --> 00:20:33,637
I can even get you the
bloody movies, man.

223
00:20:36,449 --> 00:20:38,182
Can you get me a drink?

224
00:20:44,991 --> 00:20:46,451
Did you make that song?

225
00:20:48,094 --> 00:20:49,227
Doubts?

226
00:20:49,228 --> 00:20:54,522
Nope! Just... Bhan said you made
it with a second hand computer,

227
00:20:54,967 --> 00:20:57,132
and a first class bum off the street.

228
00:20:57,837 --> 00:20:59,161
He misspoke.

229
00:20:59,939 --> 00:21:02,537
Second hand computer and
a first class artist!

230
00:21:03,242 --> 00:21:04,566
Ooh.

231
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,107
But bro,

232
00:21:13,052 --> 00:21:16,219
Now we need to scratch
the next level.

233
00:21:18,324 --> 00:21:19,682
Your own studio.

234
00:21:28,434 --> 00:21:29,928
You serious?

235
00:21:32,805 --> 00:21:35,596
Every hero has a story behind him.

236
00:21:39,445 --> 00:21:41,144
Tell me your flashback.

237
00:21:51,457 --> 00:21:53,691
Today, if possible.

238
00:22:01,968 --> 00:22:05,704
I was six years old when
my father died.

239
00:22:10,343 --> 00:22:17,071
And he left behind a disconsolate,
young mother,

240
00:22:18,651 --> 00:22:21,681
and a sad little lost kid.

241
00:22:23,623 --> 00:22:25,515
It's a very tragic story, Charlie.

242
00:22:26,692 --> 00:22:28,016
Want more?

243
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,797
Let's have a drink instead.

244
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:35,066
There's tremendous drama
in the climax... really!

245
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:36,391
Next time.

246
00:22:37,203 --> 00:22:39,494
I thought so!

247
00:22:43,743 --> 00:22:46,204
You know, the best thing about music?

248
00:22:48,214 --> 00:22:50,573
The melodies, the solo guitars...

249
00:22:51,217 --> 00:22:53,007
The chicks...

250
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,744
Bro...

251
00:22:56,355 --> 00:22:58,213
The chicks.

252
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,222
Music is...

253
00:23:03,196 --> 00:23:07,296
is like their honey.

254
00:23:09,068 --> 00:23:10,392
And they...

255
00:23:11,871 --> 00:23:15,004
They are like bees.

256
00:23:19,412 --> 00:23:22,078
I made two rap songs.

257
00:23:23,149 --> 00:23:25,679
- Really?
- In the 90s.

258
00:23:28,854 --> 00:23:30,712
The honeybees...

259
00:23:39,966 --> 00:23:41,324
Honeybees...

260
00:23:42,335 --> 00:23:44,569
I hardly come this side now.

261
00:23:44,704 --> 00:23:47,165
One is that Alibaug is too
far out of the city.

262
00:23:47,873 --> 00:23:49,640
I considered moving out here,

263
00:23:49,742 --> 00:23:52,374
but leaving Bombay is not
everyone's cup of tea.

264
00:23:53,412 --> 00:23:55,313
Welcome to my villa.

265
00:23:55,314 --> 00:23:58,149
Before the divorce we partied
a lot around here.

266
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,475
The guest house to party at.

267
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,054
The pool where I've
learnt a lot of...

268
00:24:03,055 --> 00:24:05,255
swimming with a pair of twins.

269
00:24:05,691 --> 00:24:08,627
This might go to my wife after
the divorce settlement,

270
00:24:08,628 --> 00:24:14,298
but my paradise of sin is your
studio from tomorrow.

271
00:24:51,404 --> 00:24:55,040
Raunak! Raunak!

272
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:57,809
We heard about this DJ Raunak
blowing the lid off this place.

273
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,411
Overnight,
Tango Charlie became the...

274
00:24:59,412 --> 00:25:00,845
most happening club in town.

275
00:25:00,846 --> 00:25:04,883
Raunak had something every DJ
wanted -Magical instinct.

276
00:25:04,884 --> 00:25:07,185
He gripped the pulse of the
floor in an instant.

277
00:25:07,186 --> 00:25:09,354
He'd rev the crowd up,
bring them down,

278
00:25:09,355 --> 00:25:11,885
Make them move to his beat,
he made it a crazy trip.

279
00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:52,720
I was single again,
so we started dating.

280
00:26:05,911 --> 00:26:07,371
Oh Raunak!

281
00:26:07,913 --> 00:26:09,237
Raunak!

282
00:26:21,961 --> 00:26:24,929
Raunak didn't have a stop button,
only fast forward.

283
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:26,998
It was completely mad, okay?

284
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:29,426
Charlieland was like this mad blast.

285
00:26:36,409 --> 00:26:37,903
Raunak... get it.

286
00:26:41,147 --> 00:26:43,005
No, Charlie... no, no, no, no, no...

287
00:28:22,181 --> 00:28:24,949
Hey... who are you?

288
00:28:28,187 --> 00:28:31,047
Who are you and what are
you doing in my room?

289
00:28:31,357 --> 00:28:32,919
I brought you home.

290
00:28:33,626 --> 00:28:34,950
You were wasted!

291
00:28:36,328 --> 00:28:38,152
Me?

292
00:28:47,106 --> 00:28:48,430
Alright.

293
00:28:49,642 --> 00:28:51,307
Thanks. Now, get out of here.

294
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:53,236
Hang on.

295
00:28:55,881 --> 00:28:57,375
You're not real, are you?

296
00:28:57,716 --> 00:29:00,484
What do you want to hear?
Yes? Or no!

297
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:05,914
I thought as much.

298
00:29:07,026 --> 00:29:08,350
What's your name?

299
00:29:08,694 --> 00:29:12,430
Johnny. My friends call me Johnny.

300
00:29:13,832 --> 00:29:15,360
Johnny Joker, eh?

301
00:29:17,803 --> 00:29:21,595
Was a hit song when I was a kid.
- I know, I remember.

302
00:29:22,808 --> 00:29:25,372
My dad recorded a session
for that song.

303
00:29:25,678 --> 00:29:27,138
Wasn't it Biddu's song?

304
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,274
Gita Shetty had sung it.

305
00:29:32,618 --> 00:29:33,952
Getting lowdown.

306
00:29:33,953 --> 00:29:36,854
Johnny Johnny Joker.
Fun-loving...

307
00:29:36,855 --> 00:29:39,958
Johnny Johnny Joker. Loveable...

308
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:43,160
- Disloyal...
- Oh god... still here.

309
00:29:43,362 --> 00:29:45,863
It's not a toy...

310
00:29:45,864 --> 00:29:48,155
Enough! Now get out of here.

311
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:50,125
I need to sleep.

312
00:29:50,636 --> 00:29:55,168
Is this the time to sleep?
- I know but what do I do?

313
00:29:55,741 --> 00:29:58,566
I keep shuttling endlessly from
the club to the studio.

314
00:29:58,978 --> 00:30:00,302
I'm exhausted.

315
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,104
And these mosquitoes...

316
00:30:04,049 --> 00:30:06,112
They've screwed my happiness man.

317
00:30:07,186 --> 00:30:09,120
Hmmm...
it's about time they had ration...

318
00:30:09,121 --> 00:30:10,855
cards for these mosquitoes.

319
00:30:10,856 --> 00:30:13,522
There's more mosquitoes in this
city than people anyway.

320
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:15,988
Why don't move out there?

321
00:30:17,162 --> 00:30:18,329
Where?

322
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:23,158
At the villa, where Charlie's
studio is. Talk to him about it.

323
00:30:23,736 --> 00:30:26,027
What are you so grim for?

324
00:30:26,205 --> 00:30:28,740
You can get a HIT spray for these
mosquitoes from the market.

325
00:30:28,741 --> 00:30:30,736
But where is your HIT
going to come from?

326
00:30:32,311 --> 00:30:36,206
I'll miss you sooo much. - Raunak...
you're moving to Alibaug?

327
00:30:36,215 --> 00:30:38,073
Why do you need to move out, son?

328
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:42,213
Go on, go out and play.

329
00:30:43,122 --> 00:30:45,390
So now you're going to get
sentimental on me, eh?

330
00:30:45,891 --> 00:30:47,385
All right, I won't go.

331
00:30:49,294 --> 00:30:51,829
I'm going because I want to
focus on my music a bit.

332
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:55,657
If you say, I'll drop by twice
every week for a drink.

333
00:30:56,902 --> 00:30:58,226
Now smile.

334
00:30:59,071 --> 00:31:01,601
Love you.
- One sec, I'll just get my bags.

335
00:31:20,693 --> 00:31:22,226
Recording music is a high in itself.

336
00:31:22,227 --> 00:31:27,430
You have to roll baby, roll...
you have to roll...

337
00:31:29,334 --> 00:31:30,692
All night long.

338
00:31:30,769 --> 00:31:32,770
Back then, whoever dialled
into the radio station

339
00:31:32,771 --> 00:31:35,773
would only ask for one song...

340
00:31:35,774 --> 00:31:38,065
What the F, what the F, what the F.

341
00:31:44,316 --> 00:31:48,119
The world is up in smoke.
The intoxication of the night.

342
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,479
Don't worry here.

343
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:57,492
Is everybody lost here or have
they found this path?

344
00:31:58,197 --> 00:32:00,328
Just tonight...

345
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,192
I'm just going to be...
get sombre...

346
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:08,773
All the night... waiting...

347
00:32:08,774 --> 00:32:12,043
Stop me if you can!

348
00:32:12,277 --> 00:32:16,881
I'm going down...
down... at his home...

349
00:32:16,882 --> 00:32:20,583
Dance... dance... down...
down... at his home...

350
00:32:22,154 --> 00:32:24,188
At his home...

351
00:32:24,189 --> 00:32:27,720
Oh it ain't over...

352
00:32:27,826 --> 00:32:30,061
We'd record our sessions
and push off.

353
00:32:30,062 --> 00:32:32,557
He'd be at it,
mixing it all night long.

354
00:32:34,733 --> 00:32:36,868
Tell me what to do...

355
00:32:36,869 --> 00:32:38,369
See, my life...

356
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,695
is closed in a bottle.

357
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,676
Whether it's dawn or dusk,
day or night...

358
00:32:45,677 --> 00:32:48,445
what is this intoxication?

359
00:32:48,747 --> 00:32:51,709
Tonight's the night...

360
00:32:52,117 --> 00:32:55,648
C'mon take it over.

361
00:32:55,954 --> 00:32:59,314
Gonna do what I like now...

362
00:32:59,424 --> 00:33:02,420
Match my steps...

363
00:33:02,861 --> 00:33:07,131
I'm going down...
down... at his home.

364
00:33:07,132 --> 00:33:11,266
I'm not coming over... oh yeah!

365
00:33:47,306 --> 00:33:49,506
Club, music, life...

366
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:51,403
Everything was on top gear.

367
00:33:53,178 --> 00:33:54,645
Check out his pose, man.

368
00:33:54,646 --> 00:33:56,174
He's so cool.

369
00:33:56,215 --> 00:33:58,049
- Wassssaaapp!
- What ya, Charlie,

370
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:02,514
I'd have spoken to Gudda to
design some nice stuff.

371
00:34:02,754 --> 00:34:04,078
What?

372
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:08,047
The doll.
The black jacket is so 80s.

373
00:34:08,861 --> 00:34:13,257
Whatever, man. Dude, do you
know where I got you a gig?

374
00:34:13,332 --> 00:34:15,532
And would you call it an
action figure, please?

375
00:34:15,734 --> 00:34:17,194
Doll sounds really gay!

376
00:34:17,302 --> 00:34:20,127
Yeah call it whatever ya, who
cares... what's up with her, man?

377
00:34:20,205 --> 00:34:23,497
Dude! I've plugged you
to play at Sunburn!

378
00:34:25,277 --> 00:34:27,135
I've heard of a suntan.

379
00:34:27,946 --> 00:34:29,304
What's Sunburn?

380
00:34:29,381 --> 00:34:31,046
I don't believe you man.

381
00:34:31,116 --> 00:34:35,953
Sunburn just happens to be Asia's
largest music festival bro.

382
00:34:35,954 --> 00:34:38,017
I've got you a show there.

383
00:34:38,056 --> 00:34:39,657
- You serious?
- Yes, I'm serious.

384
00:34:39,658 --> 00:34:43,261
You're going to Sunburn.
- Charlie, you are the best!

385
00:34:43,262 --> 00:34:47,198
Aren't I? Thank you, thank you.
It's okay. - THE BEST!

386
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:51,458
I told you,
didn't I, Charlie can do anything.

387
00:34:51,904 --> 00:34:54,338
Can he pass the sun tan?
- There she goes again.

388
00:34:54,339 --> 00:34:58,006
Sweetie...
sweetie can we leave now, please?

389
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:00,105
My masseuse must be waiting.

390
00:35:00,345 --> 00:35:02,875
- Here, sweetie!
- What the...

391
00:35:04,016 --> 00:35:05,340
GUDDA!!!

392
00:35:06,118 --> 00:35:09,353
Seriously man,
what are you still doing with her?

393
00:35:09,655 --> 00:35:11,547
Is she keeping you by force?

394
00:35:14,293 --> 00:35:15,924
Honeybee!

395
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,331
What you're saying!
Multiple entry?

396
00:35:20,332 --> 00:35:24,466
Nice! Good boy. Keep at it!

397
00:35:32,077 --> 00:35:33,401
Baby? Baby?

398
00:35:34,947 --> 00:35:38,011
Raunak had changed a lot,
the way he thought, his behaviour.

399
00:35:38,283 --> 00:35:40,278
It was Charlie's influence on him.

400
00:35:42,354 --> 00:35:44,188
If you want to keep
a mental picture of

401
00:35:44,189 --> 00:35:45,923
the most important moment
in your life...

402
00:35:45,924 --> 00:35:47,425
now is when you click it!

403
00:35:47,426 --> 00:35:50,092
Man... your friend piles on
the pressure very sweetly.

404
00:35:52,364 --> 00:35:53,688
Hi!

405
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,433
- What?
- Uhh... no nothing.

406
00:35:56,768 --> 00:35:57,868
No... nothing!

407
00:35:57,869 --> 00:35:59,270
I known Charlie for a long time...

408
00:35:59,271 --> 00:36:01,372
Ever since I came to the
industry I've known him,

409
00:36:01,373 --> 00:36:04,403
but I never took him seriously
because... you know,

410
00:36:05,277 --> 00:36:06,877
He was just... that kinda guy.

411
00:36:06,878 --> 00:36:08,746
So he called me incessantly saying
listen to Raunak's demo,

412
00:36:08,747 --> 00:36:10,281
Listen to Raunak's demo...
he fried my brains out.

413
00:36:10,282 --> 00:36:13,346
So I said, alright man, just
let's meet the guy!

414
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:16,487
I tread on the path of love...

415
00:36:16,755 --> 00:36:19,250
don't blame me...

416
00:36:19,257 --> 00:36:21,684
whoever I found with love...

417
00:36:21,927 --> 00:36:24,661
I became theirs...

418
00:36:26,999 --> 00:36:29,358
I became theirs...

419
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:40,608
I accept pain...

420
00:36:41,113 --> 00:36:43,711
I accept peace...

421
00:36:43,915 --> 00:36:48,675
'Pain' reminded me...
where's Shonali nowadays?

422
00:36:49,354 --> 00:36:51,679
She's on a calender shoot.
- Good riddance!

423
00:36:51,823 --> 00:36:53,920
Looks like her days are numbered.

424
00:36:54,993 --> 00:36:58,592
Get your act together man.
This could be your big break.

425
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:01,926
Yeah I know. Now get the
hell out. Let me sleep.

426
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,266
Payday's knocking on your door.
Are you nervous?

427
00:37:06,872 --> 00:37:09,340
Yeah!
This is what I came here for.

428
00:37:09,341 --> 00:37:11,242
Now am frigging bricks
so I'm going back.

429
00:37:11,243 --> 00:37:13,177
Now leave me alone.
I have to sleep.

430
00:37:13,178 --> 00:37:15,713
Don't be an airhead yet.

431
00:37:15,714 --> 00:37:18,249
Just because you're a hot
DJ in your little club

432
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,017
doesn't mean you've become AR Rahman.

433
00:37:20,018 --> 00:37:22,548
They call him the Mozart from Madras.

434
00:37:22,754 --> 00:37:25,189
You're not even a Beethoven
from Bandra yet.

435
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:30,154
Just admit it. You're scared
of messing it up now.

436
00:37:30,996 --> 00:37:33,958
What if you've inherited
failure as well?

437
00:37:56,254 --> 00:37:59,717
Your highness, get the TV.
Your Sunburn interview is on.

438
00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:06,426
Music is everywhere in Goa,

439
00:38:06,731 --> 00:38:08,332
In the shacks, pubs, discs.

440
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:12,125
There's music outdoors,
there's music indoors.

441
00:38:12,671 --> 00:38:15,439
You know Doors?
My friend Jimmy Morisson?

442
00:38:23,915 --> 00:38:25,749
Turn up the volume.

443
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:29,611
A little more... a little more.

444
00:38:32,057 --> 00:38:35,258
Turn down the darn volume.

445
00:38:36,128 --> 00:38:37,795
Now I'll ask you a question.

446
00:38:37,796 --> 00:38:40,189
Why do people keep coming
back to Goa?

447
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:44,632
I'll tell you.
Because Goa means Go -Aa.

448
00:38:44,936 --> 00:38:48,569
Have you gone and lost your mind?
- Go -Vaapis aa.

449
00:38:49,374 --> 00:38:53,235
Have you gone deaf? - I know it's
a little philosophical...

450
00:38:55,247 --> 00:38:57,708
You know Raunak,
if you drink a little less,

451
00:38:57,816 --> 00:38:59,913
Then maybe you'll say
something sensible.

452
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:04,110
I'm just an ordinary fuse...

453
00:39:04,256 --> 00:39:05,923
I'm fed up of you.

454
00:39:05,924 --> 00:39:10,524
You've become a bum. You don't
even shower until afternoon.

455
00:39:11,296 --> 00:39:16,624
What is the matter with you?
- If I blow up, it's a BANG!

456
00:39:39,591 --> 00:39:42,985
How disgusting. You're drinking
before brushing even?

457
00:39:43,828 --> 00:39:45,196
What are you going on about?

458
00:39:45,197 --> 00:39:48,364
Whatever.
Just come down... come down.

459
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,065
So in any case, I want this fixed.

460
00:39:51,636 --> 00:39:55,167
I'm thinking of landscaping the
garden. What do you think?

461
00:40:10,722 --> 00:40:12,890
Ma'am, will Sir have breakfast?

462
00:40:12,891 --> 00:40:15,091
Sir will break his fast
with anything but food.

463
00:40:15,093 --> 00:40:16,690
Sir is allergic to breakfast.

464
00:40:20,298 --> 00:40:22,964
So what do you think?
Wrought iron or cane?

465
00:40:27,973 --> 00:40:29,501
How about a bit of both!?

466
00:40:30,008 --> 00:40:31,275
I'm sorry, Saraswati...

467
00:40:31,276 --> 00:40:34,340
but you know how Madam flies
into a temper. - Sir, I'm Laxmi.

468
00:40:34,879 --> 00:40:37,113
Take care of yourself, Saraswati.

469
00:40:37,115 --> 00:40:38,507
Sir, Laxmi.

470
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:41,742
I understand, Saraswati.

471
00:40:42,921 --> 00:40:47,521
Keep this until you find
something good.

472
00:40:48,126 --> 00:40:49,723
Sir it's Laxmi, sir.

473
00:40:49,894 --> 00:40:52,526
Hello... yo... get in, get in.

474
00:40:53,265 --> 00:40:55,123
Looks like he's deaf.

475
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,258
Put your bags in.

476
00:40:59,437 --> 00:41:01,705
Raunak's problem started
quite sans drama.

477
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,208
It crept up on him in small,
everyday things.

478
00:41:04,209 --> 00:41:05,743
He kept it to himself,
kept ignoring it.

479
00:41:05,744 --> 00:41:08,035
He thought it's a normal thing,

480
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,070
I'd have done the same thing.

481
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:20,582
Good morning.

482
00:41:28,133 --> 00:41:31,698
So what I wanna do is...
it's a Punjabi wedding atmosphere,

483
00:41:32,871 --> 00:41:34,305
A real Punjabi wedding.

484
00:41:34,306 --> 00:41:36,707
Uhh...
whatever angst they're feeling...

485
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:38,942
you know people are sitting around,

486
00:41:38,943 --> 00:41:43,013
Having dinner, she's sitting on
the other side of his table...

487
00:41:43,014 --> 00:41:45,349
And they want to say stuff
to each other...

488
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:47,550
And then we get to the song.

489
00:41:47,786 --> 00:41:51,578
So whatever they want to say...
you listening to me, Raunak?

490
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:55,990
The first few sessions
were quite dull.

491
00:41:56,461 --> 00:41:58,796
Raunak had potential,

492
00:41:58,797 --> 00:42:00,631
He had enormous talent
but he lacked focus.

493
00:42:00,632 --> 00:42:02,166
I mean, in person he'd be
sitting in front of me,

494
00:42:02,167 --> 00:42:04,028
but his mind was someplace far away.

495
00:42:04,102 --> 00:42:07,303
So I told Charlie to give
him some creative space.

496
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:09,930
That would help him channel
his talent better.

497
00:42:29,761 --> 00:42:31,153
Cut this nonsense!

498
00:42:31,963 --> 00:42:34,231
Go play jazz in a hotel lobby if
that's what ticks your goat.

499
00:42:34,232 --> 00:42:36,300
What's this chisss chisss chiss
nonsense you're playing?

500
00:42:36,301 --> 00:42:38,125
Hit it hard! Bang it!

501
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:41,165
Do you have any clue what
hitting it hard is like?

502
00:42:42,907 --> 00:42:45,198
Huh? DO YOU?!

503
00:42:46,378 --> 00:42:47,702
You!

504
00:42:47,812 --> 00:42:50,444
Like this, this is what I want.

505
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,587
What's your problem now?
- If he's down, I'm down.

506
00:42:56,755 --> 00:42:58,079
It's a strike!

507
00:42:58,289 --> 00:42:59,456
What?

508
00:42:59,457 --> 00:43:00,883
STRIKE!

509
00:43:01,926 --> 00:43:03,250
Strike?

510
00:43:06,731 --> 00:43:09,090
What are you, making music
or working in a factory?

511
00:43:09,167 --> 00:43:11,628
You want to try union tactics
on me? Freaking zoozoo.

512
00:43:12,103 --> 00:43:14,098
If you don't want to work,
go to hell.

513
00:43:15,707 --> 00:43:17,975
Don't make this studio
a government office.

514
00:43:29,387 --> 00:43:31,121
HIT THE DAMN GUITAR!!!

515
00:43:31,122 --> 00:43:35,119
Create... create...

516
00:43:35,226 --> 00:43:36,326
Right now.

517
00:43:36,327 --> 00:43:40,495
Create... create...

518
00:43:40,832 --> 00:43:42,156
Right now.

519
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:47,563
Praise the almighty!

520
00:43:47,705 --> 00:43:52,635
Praise the almighty!

521
00:43:52,777 --> 00:43:58,413
Praise the almighty!

522
00:43:58,416 --> 00:44:03,387
Praise the almighty!

523
00:44:03,388 --> 00:44:07,825
Create... create...

524
00:44:07,826 --> 00:44:09,150
Right now.

525
00:44:19,704 --> 00:44:25,008
Purify my spirit,
O my dear holy spirit.

526
00:44:25,009 --> 00:44:30,576
Purify my spirit,
O my dear holy spirit.

527
00:44:30,715 --> 00:44:35,919
Guide the ones who've
gone astray, O lord.

528
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:41,317
Guide the ones who've
gone astray, O lord.

529
00:44:41,392 --> 00:44:45,863
Create... create...

530
00:44:45,864 --> 00:44:46,997
Right now.

531
00:44:46,998 --> 00:44:50,968
Create... create...

532
00:44:50,969 --> 00:44:52,302
Right now.

533
00:44:52,303 --> 00:44:57,841
Praise the almighty!

534
00:44:57,842 --> 00:45:03,512
Praise the almighty!

535
00:45:03,581 --> 00:45:08,819
Praise the almighty!

536
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:13,957
Praise the almighty!

537
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:17,989
Create... create...

538
00:45:18,229 --> 00:45:19,363
Right now.

539
00:45:19,364 --> 00:45:23,300
Create... create...

540
00:45:23,301 --> 00:45:24,625
Right now.

541
00:45:24,802 --> 00:45:28,906
Create... create...

542
00:45:28,907 --> 00:45:30,367
Right now.

543
00:47:20,618 --> 00:47:22,044
I'm going for a shower.

544
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:25,020
I'm going for a shower.

545
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:28,151
You want me to call the media?

546
00:47:29,994 --> 00:47:33,957
What? - I asked if you want me
to call a press conference?

547
00:47:34,132 --> 00:47:36,093
It's a bloody bath, for godssake.

548
00:47:36,267 --> 00:47:39,001
You should file a case on her...

549
00:47:39,237 --> 00:47:43,530
Section 332,
voluntarily causing grievous hurt.

550
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:46,302
His DJ sets were getting affected.

551
00:47:48,112 --> 00:47:50,380
He wasn't sober when
DJing at the club.

552
00:48:44,335 --> 00:48:47,070
Happy birthday to you!

553
00:48:47,071 --> 00:48:49,039
Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you...

554
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,706
Thanks, you remembered?

555
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:55,035
I don't need to 'Remember' it.
I know.

556
00:48:55,213 --> 00:48:58,573
Happy birthday dear Raunak.

557
00:49:01,986 --> 00:49:03,446
What's happening to me?

558
00:49:07,325 --> 00:49:09,058
What's HAPPENING TO ME?

559
00:49:10,261 --> 00:49:13,462
Really. I have no clue!

560
00:49:20,238 --> 00:49:22,199
What the hell is going on, Raunak?

561
00:49:25,076 --> 00:49:26,400
Nothing much.

562
00:49:27,779 --> 00:49:29,980
I've just come from a meeting
with Anurag's producer.

563
00:49:29,981 --> 00:49:33,250
He said if the tracks are ready,
he wants to hear them.

564
00:49:33,785 --> 00:49:37,077
- Hmm... he's bugged, boss!
- Ssshhh!

565
00:49:37,822 --> 00:49:39,248
What the hell man?

566
00:49:42,059 --> 00:49:43,621
Hey dude!

567
00:49:44,228 --> 00:49:46,086
The shoot schedule is locked down.

568
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:49,058
They have dates from the actors.
So?

569
00:49:49,267 --> 00:49:50,591
I'm on it Charlie!

570
00:49:52,136 --> 00:49:54,370
What do you want from me now?
- Oh, man!

571
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,264
This is nonsense.

572
00:50:00,178 --> 00:50:01,706
Charlie sit the hell down.

573
00:50:02,246 --> 00:50:04,241
Or do you dance on my head!

574
00:50:05,049 --> 00:50:08,079
Thanks, sir.
- I just might do that you know.

575
00:50:08,252 --> 00:50:09,576
Thank you.

576
00:50:12,156 --> 00:50:15,482
I was at the gig last night.
- Yeah, he's the man!

577
00:50:16,427 --> 00:50:17,727
Rockstar!

578
00:50:17,728 --> 00:50:19,052
I know.

579
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:22,833
It was a bit off.
- Just a little wee bit...

580
00:50:22,834 --> 00:50:24,201
- Just a tad.
- Oh shut up!

581
00:50:24,202 --> 00:50:27,164
What do you mean a tad off?
Have you lost your mind?

582
00:50:27,772 --> 00:50:30,267
I've seen nonsense before, but this.

583
00:50:30,408 --> 00:50:32,198
This was the worse than darn!

584
00:50:33,411 --> 00:50:35,412
Of course!
Who else would know darn better!

585
00:50:35,413 --> 00:50:36,847
Shut up!
No one asked for your opinion.

586
00:50:36,848 --> 00:50:39,241
Just shut up and get out!
Out! - Are you talking to me?

587
00:50:39,383 --> 00:50:42,311
How dare you?!
Some nerve you got to...

588
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,789
And moron, what are you looking
at? It's all because of you!

589
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:47,457
- What?
- You know what...

590
00:50:47,458 --> 00:50:51,159
the both of you,
go die, burn in hell -Together!

591
00:50:51,662 --> 00:50:52,986
It's over!

592
00:50:56,033 --> 00:50:57,664
Do you need any help packing?

593
00:50:57,768 --> 00:51:00,696
Leave me alone...
just get the hell out, everyone.

594
00:51:01,138 --> 00:51:04,703
Listen Shonali, take those arbit
childhood pictures of yours.

595
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,610
Hey bro!

596
00:51:06,611 --> 00:51:07,410
Hey Raunak...

597
00:51:07,411 --> 00:51:09,980
listen, get up, come on mate,
get up... listen to me.

598
00:51:09,981 --> 00:51:12,115
There's no one here now,
it's just me alright?

599
00:51:12,116 --> 00:51:17,012
She's gone... but for a change,
what she said made sense.

600
00:51:18,422 --> 00:51:20,952
Even you've got to agree,
last night was messed up.

601
00:51:21,092 --> 00:51:22,518
I mean come on,

602
00:51:22,994 --> 00:51:25,159
It was BAD!

603
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:26,954
Not bad?

604
00:51:29,033 --> 00:51:30,357
You've gone deaf!

605
00:51:31,636 --> 00:51:33,733
- What?
- You're GONE DEAF!!!

606
00:51:35,072 --> 00:51:39,570
TONE DEAF! You've gone deaf moron!

607
00:51:40,878 --> 00:51:44,341
I'm handling the producers here,
holding them at bay.

608
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:50,179
Look dude,
Anurag is a cool guy, he's a dude,

609
00:51:50,288 --> 00:51:53,352
But don't think he'll
wait for you forever.

610
00:51:55,226 --> 00:51:57,687
Charlie, come on, relax!

611
00:51:58,462 --> 00:52:00,964
It's a temporary problem,
I'll be okay.

612
00:52:00,965 --> 00:52:04,496
What do you think this is,
a freaking dent on the car?

613
00:52:04,702 --> 00:52:07,664
You're barely even able to follow
this conversation man!

614
00:52:10,841 --> 00:52:12,267
Here's my advice mate,

615
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,404
Go see a doctor.

616
00:52:21,052 --> 00:52:22,944
Charlie, I have an idea.

617
00:52:25,356 --> 00:52:27,954
I think I should go see a doctor!

618
00:52:29,193 --> 00:52:30,551
What do you say?

619
00:52:34,265 --> 00:52:37,363
Mr. Kaul,
tell me about your lifestyle.

620
00:52:37,702 --> 00:52:40,562
It'll be best if you're perfectly
honest with me.

621
00:52:40,738 --> 00:52:42,062
Do you smoke?

622
00:52:43,341 --> 00:52:44,665
Cigarettes?

623
00:52:45,943 --> 00:52:48,643
Yep! - How much? - 1 pack.

624
00:52:48,946 --> 00:52:50,338
2 packs on gig days.

625
00:52:51,349 --> 00:52:53,617
And... alcohol?

626
00:52:53,751 --> 00:52:55,177
Drinks, Mr. Kaul?

627
00:52:58,189 --> 00:53:00,480
- I like drinks.
- Lovely. How many?

628
00:53:00,825 --> 00:53:03,958
Two, four...
sometimes up to six. - Six?

629
00:53:04,829 --> 00:53:06,926
Wait, does this include beer?

630
00:53:07,164 --> 00:53:09,329
Of course.
Even beer gives you a high, right?

631
00:53:11,202 --> 00:53:14,596
Do I count a bottle
as one peg or two?

632
00:53:14,839 --> 00:53:16,470
Two, let's say two.

633
00:53:18,309 --> 00:53:20,440
Say Fifteen -Round figure.
- 15. Hm...

634
00:53:21,712 --> 00:53:23,036
What about drugs?

635
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:31,512
What kind? - Ayurvedic...
grass, weed... the stuff babas do.

636
00:53:32,089 --> 00:53:33,413
Anything else?

637
00:53:34,392 --> 00:53:37,661
I tried Heroin,
but it didn't suit me.

638
00:53:37,828 --> 00:53:40,062
- Why?
- I was too drunk at the time.

639
00:53:41,032 --> 00:53:42,629
Hmm... must've gotten mixed.

640
00:53:43,401 --> 00:53:44,725
Ecstasy pills.

641
00:53:45,669 --> 00:53:47,368
I have a rule with those

642
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:50,734
party drugs only at parties.

643
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:52,532
Anything else?

644
00:53:53,177 --> 00:53:56,173
Nope... Never tried Cocaine.

645
00:53:58,649 --> 00:54:00,507
Too expensive, you know.
Tell me something,

646
00:54:01,085 --> 00:54:04,183
Why are things that get made
in a lab, so costly?

647
00:54:05,156 --> 00:54:07,117
Cocaine is super expensive, isn't it?

648
00:54:07,725 --> 00:54:09,049
Ya...

649
00:54:12,363 --> 00:54:15,029
So... what about, like... sex?

650
00:54:15,066 --> 00:54:17,061
Do you practice safe sex?

651
00:54:20,738 --> 00:54:22,172
You should meet my girlfriend.

652
00:54:22,173 --> 00:54:24,270
Even a conversation with
her isn't safe.

653
00:54:39,356 --> 00:54:45,026
Do not give up...

654
00:54:46,664 --> 00:54:52,994
You'll reach eden by treading
the path of thorns.

655
00:54:55,106 --> 00:55:00,469
Do not give up...

656
00:55:01,912 --> 00:55:08,912
You'll reach eden by treading
the path of thorns.

657
00:55:09,286 --> 00:55:13,223
O wanderer...

658
00:55:13,224 --> 00:55:17,160
O wanderer...

659
00:55:17,161 --> 00:55:20,864
O wanderer...

660
00:55:20,865 --> 00:55:25,226
O wanderer...

661
00:55:42,786 --> 00:55:47,323
Mr. Kaul, the human body has
incredible regeneration skills.

662
00:55:47,324 --> 00:55:49,285
Cut to the chase Doctor.

663
00:55:49,393 --> 00:55:53,254
What's wrong with me?
- Look, don't panic but... uh...

664
00:55:53,831 --> 00:55:58,534
You're going to lose your
hearing completely.

665
00:56:00,971 --> 00:56:02,906
It's just a matter of time.

666
00:56:02,907 --> 00:56:05,573
You have something called Tinnitus.

667
00:56:06,343 --> 00:56:09,271
It comes from prolonged exposure
to loud sounds.

668
00:56:09,947 --> 00:56:11,680
Your right ear is completely useless,

669
00:56:11,949 --> 00:56:16,549
but the left is still about 30%
functional at the moment.

670
00:56:16,921 --> 00:56:18,245
I'll explain.

671
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:22,517
Mr. Kaul, this... Mr. Kaul.

672
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:25,061
This is your cochleae,

673
00:56:25,062 --> 00:56:28,298
and this basically reads the
vibrations picked up by the ear,

674
00:56:28,299 --> 00:56:30,233
and translates them for the brain...

675
00:56:30,234 --> 00:56:32,627
so you understand the
sounds you hear.

676
00:56:33,204 --> 00:56:37,463
Now this cochlea is filled with
a fluid which is leaking.

677
00:56:37,708 --> 00:56:40,743
I think it's uh... hereditary.

678
00:56:40,744 --> 00:56:44,070
Can't we plug the leak...
Like with an M-Seal or something?

679
00:56:44,949 --> 00:56:46,416
It is an extremely delicate area.

680
00:56:46,417 --> 00:56:48,685
There isn't much we
can do surgically.

681
00:56:48,986 --> 00:56:51,287
You are going to have to extricate
yourself from your

682
00:56:51,288 --> 00:56:53,078
professional environment.

683
00:56:53,624 --> 00:56:54,982
No music?

684
00:56:55,192 --> 00:56:56,720
I'm afraid so.

685
00:56:57,194 --> 00:56:59,729
Mr. Kaul, I only have one
piece of advice for you,

686
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:02,932
Absolute silence to
preserve the fluid.

687
00:57:02,933 --> 00:57:05,133
There is a chance that your
hearing gets better.

688
00:57:05,269 --> 00:57:09,505
Like I said, do everything you
can to rejuvenate your body.

689
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:13,132
Quit smoking,
drinking, drugs, all that,

690
00:57:13,644 --> 00:57:15,605
And you'll have to get
proper hours of sleep.

691
00:57:15,646 --> 00:57:17,504
Is there nothing you can do, doctor?

692
00:57:23,153 --> 00:57:25,011
This is a hearing aid,

693
00:57:25,155 --> 00:57:29,050
but only use this when you have to.

694
00:57:37,034 --> 00:57:38,368
How could we have figured?

695
00:57:38,369 --> 00:57:40,694
Music is always blaring in
the studio or the club.

696
00:57:40,771 --> 00:57:42,605
He'd stare at the screen
like a maniac...

697
00:57:42,606 --> 00:57:44,931
we assumed he was high.
- Professional side effects.

698
00:57:45,042 --> 00:57:47,043
Raunak's ailment is quite a common...

699
00:57:47,044 --> 00:57:48,845
one among DJs and musicians.

700
00:57:48,846 --> 00:57:51,706
Especially rockstars...
like Pete Townsend.

701
00:57:52,016 --> 00:57:54,648
And of course,
Beethoven, the greatest composer...

702
00:57:54,752 --> 00:57:59,422
He finally turned deaf. - Neither
companion, nor a reason...

703
00:57:59,423 --> 00:58:03,259
this is your test of fire.

704
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:07,155
Neither companion, nor a reason...

705
00:58:07,164 --> 00:58:10,900
this is your test of fire.

706
00:58:11,101 --> 00:58:12,935
Do you know what your problem is?

707
00:58:12,936 --> 00:58:14,637
It's become imperative for you to...

708
00:58:14,638 --> 00:58:16,205
entertain people all the time.

709
00:58:16,206 --> 00:58:18,997
You're always performing for them.

710
00:58:19,343 --> 00:58:25,206
You've got too used to people
around you, music and crowds.

711
00:58:25,783 --> 00:58:28,017
It's become your addiction.

712
00:58:28,886 --> 00:58:33,213
And if you don't have that,
you need this right.

713
00:58:34,158 --> 00:58:35,992
Drink it.

714
00:58:35,993 --> 00:58:37,487
I have to quit it all...

715
00:58:38,595 --> 00:58:40,260
And I can't with you around.

716
00:58:41,965 --> 00:58:45,735
Let nobody stop you...

717
00:58:45,736 --> 00:58:48,638
calling out to you.

718
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:52,170
O wanderer...

719
00:58:52,242 --> 00:58:56,137
O wanderer...

720
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,004
Do not stop...

721
00:59:18,969 --> 00:59:20,531
Should I tell your mother?

722
00:59:23,073 --> 00:59:24,601
She won't like it.

723
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:27,900
I've kept this from everyone,

724
00:59:28,679 --> 00:59:31,413
Biscuit, Banjo, Shonali.

725
00:59:36,754 --> 00:59:40,080
Some inheritance he's left me.
Thanks dad!

726
00:59:47,664 --> 00:59:50,432
Okay sir, thank you, sorry again.

727
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:55,004
Anurag's producer on the line.

728
00:59:58,075 --> 01:00:00,536
That was Anurag's producer,
on the line.

729
01:00:00,911 --> 01:00:02,303
What did you say?

730
01:00:02,746 --> 01:00:05,606
Same old line. That you're going
through some personal darn.

731
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:09,419
That all geniuses function
the same way.

732
01:00:09,853 --> 01:00:11,177
Charlie,

733
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:16,158
You know what the doc told me?
- He's asked me to rest my ears.

734
01:00:20,097 --> 01:00:22,092
I won't be able to work for a while.

735
01:00:22,132 --> 01:00:23,456
What do you mean?

736
01:00:23,667 --> 01:00:24,991
Charlie,

737
01:00:26,437 --> 01:00:28,602
This is my only hope
for getting better

738
01:00:28,739 --> 01:00:31,701
that I rest my ears, completely.
Please!

739
01:00:32,109 --> 01:00:33,603
Rest? Rest!!!

740
01:00:34,178 --> 01:00:35,945
What the hell else have you been...

741
01:00:35,946 --> 01:00:36,979
doing for the past three months?

742
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:39,315
Look, they've finished shooting
their dialogue scenes,

743
01:00:39,316 --> 01:00:41,050
Now they NEED the songs.

744
01:00:41,051 --> 01:00:43,615
And all I know is that you
HAVE to deliver it!

745
01:00:44,121 --> 01:00:47,290
The producers even revised their
shoot schedule for you,

746
01:00:47,291 --> 01:00:48,717
You spoilt brat!

747
01:00:48,725 --> 01:00:50,860
And you know exactly what
happens to our contract,

748
01:00:50,861 --> 01:00:52,958
if you don't deliver
this time around.

749
01:00:53,797 --> 01:00:57,033
And the huge advance
we took for this job

750
01:00:57,034 --> 01:01:01,566
is blown to dust... on your vices!

751
01:01:01,939 --> 01:01:04,605
You don't DJ anymore, so that
stream has run dry as well.

752
01:01:05,108 --> 01:01:07,410
I don't care. You just have
to finish this project.

753
01:01:07,411 --> 01:01:10,271
You think I haven't
thought about this?

754
01:01:10,981 --> 01:01:12,612
This isn't easy for me either,

755
01:01:12,716 --> 01:01:14,916
but it's the question of
my entire bloody life.

756
01:01:15,886 --> 01:01:18,245
I, me, mine, my life...

757
01:01:18,255 --> 01:01:21,581
You are the most self-centered
rogue I've ever seen, Raunak.

758
01:01:23,961 --> 01:01:27,163
I don't care what you do after
this project is finished,

759
01:01:27,164 --> 01:01:28,731
but you got to get this done.

760
01:01:28,732 --> 01:01:30,066
You want to rest, rest it out.

761
01:01:30,067 --> 01:01:32,164
You want to kill yourself,
be my guest.

762
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:34,704
It's just a couple of weeks...

763
01:01:34,705 --> 01:01:36,495
get into the studio and wrap it up.

764
01:01:38,876 --> 01:01:40,939
This is nonsense dude!

765
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:43,403
Why so grim mate?

766
01:01:43,413 --> 01:01:46,341
Let's finish this song and
get the hell out of here.

767
01:02:57,955 --> 01:02:59,088
Hello!

768
01:02:59,089 --> 01:03:02,290
Do you have any values?

769
01:03:04,962 --> 01:03:06,524
What bullcrap is this man?

770
01:03:06,697 --> 01:03:08,664
We've kept our traps shut
this whole time.

771
01:03:08,665 --> 01:03:10,066
Taken your nonsense, your whims,

772
01:03:10,067 --> 01:03:12,062
all that to listen to this darn mix?

773
01:03:13,704 --> 01:03:16,302
- What?
- Are you frigging deaf?

774
01:03:25,682 --> 01:03:27,006
You're deaf?

775
01:03:27,651 --> 01:03:28,975
Almost.

776
01:03:29,953 --> 01:03:31,277
Since when?

777
01:03:32,289 --> 01:03:35,649
Been a while.
And it's getting worse.

778
01:03:36,393 --> 01:03:38,160
Why didn't you tell us?

779
01:03:38,996 --> 01:03:40,558
What would I have said?

780
01:03:41,965 --> 01:03:43,527
It was my secret man.

781
01:03:46,737 --> 01:03:49,403
No one goes around broadcasting
their impotence now, do they?

782
01:03:51,942 --> 01:03:53,709
Right ear's totally out,

783
01:03:55,879 --> 01:03:57,271
There's no hope.

784
01:04:00,083 --> 01:04:01,407
See, nothing!

785
01:04:02,386 --> 01:04:04,654
There's some hope the left
might recover though.

786
01:04:09,893 --> 01:04:11,455
But I've got to be careful.

787
01:04:16,099 --> 01:04:18,060
This hearing aid helps a bit.

788
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:24,436
But the doc has asked me to
use it only in emergencies.

789
01:04:25,709 --> 01:04:27,567
I can hear a bit with this.

790
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:54,870
- What?
- Man, he just... he just...

791
01:04:54,871 --> 01:04:56,729
Same darn, another day man...
let's go.

792
01:05:28,609 --> 01:05:30,501
No... no!

793
01:05:54,835 --> 01:05:58,161
This life... that we are living,

794
01:05:58,572 --> 01:06:02,467
this life that we have...

795
01:06:02,943 --> 01:06:09,943
This is... the lovely colours... and
beauty...

796
01:06:10,317 --> 01:06:13,720
There is a little sorrow!

797
01:06:13,721 --> 01:06:17,557
A little bit of happiness...

798
01:06:17,558 --> 01:06:21,055
A little bit of sorrow...

799
01:06:21,262 --> 01:06:23,830
A little bit of happiness,

800
01:06:23,831 --> 01:06:30,831
this is... this is... the shadow
of the sun light!

801
01:06:30,871 --> 01:06:34,441
Yes... this is life...

802
01:06:34,442 --> 01:06:36,943
And in this life...

803
01:06:36,944 --> 01:06:43,944
This is only the true colours
of life and beauty...

804
01:06:44,285 --> 01:06:47,850
This is a life.

805
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:12,178
You haven't worked on it at all,
have you?

806
01:07:13,581 --> 01:07:14,905
Darn man!

807
01:07:18,853 --> 01:07:23,852
Look man, leaving our friendship
and personal equation aside,

808
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:25,792
That's cool but I don't
think I can...

809
01:07:25,793 --> 01:07:27,754
continue with you anymore mate.

810
01:07:28,429 --> 01:07:30,560
Charlie,
I can't hear a thing anymore.

811
01:07:31,165 --> 01:07:32,989
I think you ought to leave now.

812
01:07:34,702 --> 01:07:36,026
Oh man!

813
01:07:36,871 --> 01:07:38,195
Been to a doctor?

814
01:07:38,739 --> 01:07:43,910
Go to a doctor, or go out into
the hills to find some peace.

815
01:07:43,911 --> 01:07:48,204
Do whatever it takes but take
care of yourself, mate.

816
01:07:51,285 --> 01:07:53,746
I'll handle things here.

817
01:07:54,355 --> 01:07:58,591
Just hope the bloody producer
doesn't sue me, man.

818
01:08:03,531 --> 01:08:05,162
All the best, Raunak,

819
01:08:06,433 --> 01:08:07,757
All the best.

820
01:08:16,644 --> 01:08:17,968
Mr. Kaul...

821
01:08:19,613 --> 01:08:20,937
Please sit!

822
01:08:24,785 --> 01:08:27,645
This is an alternate therapy.

823
01:08:27,655 --> 01:08:32,517
Give it a shot.
It might just help. Read up on it.

824
01:08:32,626 --> 01:08:34,827
Ok -To begin with, I will put
this liquid in your ears.

825
01:08:34,828 --> 01:08:37,722
Don't worry, it's only oil. See?

826
01:08:39,266 --> 01:08:41,193
Then I will take this candle,

827
01:08:41,335 --> 01:08:43,626
It's like a pipe,
open from both sides...

828
01:08:44,171 --> 01:08:45,768
And it will create a vacuum.

829
01:08:46,206 --> 01:08:47,803
Turn around.

830
01:08:50,411 --> 01:08:52,906
Then, I will light this candle up.

831
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:55,214
You're going to start feeling warm...

832
01:08:55,215 --> 01:08:57,216
now as the oil slowly flows into...

833
01:08:57,217 --> 01:08:58,885
Excuse me...
how much time will it take?

834
01:08:58,886 --> 01:09:03,323
Aaah... oh my, God!
Oh, my God. Help! Help!

835
01:09:03,324 --> 01:09:04,857
There's a fire!
Get up, get up! With my eyes...

836
01:09:04,858 --> 01:09:08,855
When our eyes met...

837
01:09:08,929 --> 01:09:12,596
When our eyes met...

838
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:15,460
When the eyes met...

839
01:09:18,672 --> 01:09:24,808
When your eyes meet mine...

840
01:09:24,812 --> 01:09:28,240
When your eyes meet my eyes...

841
01:09:28,849 --> 01:09:32,084
When eyes meet...

842
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:35,850
We had no news. Charlie was mum.

843
01:09:35,856 --> 01:09:37,824
Even that Shonali wasn't
saying anything.

844
01:09:37,825 --> 01:09:42,195
Yeah, but Banjo did say that he
was in some combat ashram...

845
01:09:42,196 --> 01:09:45,832
In Coimbatore...
in an ashram, meditating.

846
01:09:45,833 --> 01:09:48,727
Yeah, the complete silence
types, you know.

847
01:09:49,303 --> 01:09:50,737
So inspiring, no?

848
01:09:50,738 --> 01:09:56,843
When my eyes met your eyes...

849
01:09:56,844 --> 01:10:00,580
When eyes met...

850
01:10:00,681 --> 01:10:03,973
When the eyes met...

851
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:12,659
When your eyes met my eyes...

852
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:16,691
When eyes met...

853
01:10:16,930 --> 01:10:20,097
When eyes met...

854
01:10:21,802 --> 01:10:24,900
Raunak had shut himself in a room.

855
01:10:25,239 --> 01:10:28,201
He was convinced that if his
hearing had to recover,

856
01:10:28,308 --> 01:10:30,910
He'd have to insulate himself
from any kind of noise.

857
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:35,113
Why do you come in
front of my eyes...

858
01:10:35,382 --> 01:10:40,051
O my beloved...

859
01:10:40,788 --> 01:10:44,857
Why do you come in
front of my eyes...

860
01:10:44,858 --> 01:10:49,026
O my beloved...

861
01:10:50,898 --> 01:10:54,267
Now you tell me... my beloved...

862
01:10:54,268 --> 01:10:58,060
how would I be able to pass time.

863
01:10:58,872 --> 01:11:01,240
Now you tell me... my beloved...

864
01:11:01,241 --> 01:11:03,975
how would I be able to pass time.

865
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:10,607
When our eyes met...

866
01:11:27,301 --> 01:11:30,126
I could have stopped him
from moving to Alibaug.

867
01:11:31,572 --> 01:11:35,000
I could have stopped him
from moving to Bombay.

868
01:11:37,177 --> 01:11:39,145
But he's Parth Kaul's son.

869
01:11:39,146 --> 01:11:45,180
When my eyes met your eyes...

870
01:11:45,385 --> 01:11:48,855
When our eyes met...

871
01:11:48,856 --> 01:11:52,182
When our eyes met...

872
01:11:54,862 --> 01:12:00,900
When your eyes met my eyes...

873
01:12:00,901 --> 01:12:04,637
When our eyes met...

874
01:12:05,139 --> 01:12:08,408
When our eyes meet...

875
01:12:10,344 --> 01:12:12,612
This was the worst phase
of Raunak's life.

876
01:12:12,613 --> 01:12:14,347
I doubt if he stepped out of that...

877
01:12:14,348 --> 01:12:16,138
room in those couple of months.

878
01:12:16,617 --> 01:12:20,876
He'd receded into a very dark
state of depression.

879
01:12:21,355 --> 01:12:24,556
One's heard that all geniuses
lose it at some point.

880
01:12:24,892 --> 01:12:27,493
He was probably going through
the same thing.

881
01:12:27,494 --> 01:12:34,029
My beloved life... what
did life tell you...

882
01:12:34,301 --> 01:12:41,301
When the eyes spoke... to each
other... they asked why?

883
01:12:42,309 --> 01:12:45,845
My mind is not set here!

884
01:12:45,846 --> 01:12:49,513
O my beloved life...

885
01:12:50,951 --> 01:12:57,451
When eyes... met.

886
01:13:34,394 --> 01:13:36,457
Good morning, sister-in-law.
- Good morning.

887
01:13:38,265 --> 01:13:40,226
Don't you have to go
to the club today?

888
01:13:41,568 --> 01:13:43,703
No,
they're in talks to sell it off...

889
01:13:43,704 --> 01:13:45,767
so we're shut for a few days.

890
01:13:48,675 --> 01:13:50,610
Do you want to see him?
I can take you there.

891
01:13:50,611 --> 01:13:52,435
He'll come here when he's ready.

892
01:13:52,512 --> 01:13:55,042
You said the same thing about Parth.

893
01:13:55,249 --> 01:13:56,948
He didn't come though, did he?

894
01:13:58,218 --> 01:13:59,917
At least not while he was alive.

895
01:14:18,438 --> 01:14:23,141
Oh, darn!
Oh, darn! Help me! Help, help!

896
01:14:41,929 --> 01:14:46,029
I'd completely lost hope.
I wasn't sure he was coming back.

897
01:14:53,707 --> 01:14:56,475
I never doubted whether
he'd come back.

898
01:14:56,543 --> 01:14:59,245
The only question for me
was when he'd come back,

899
01:14:59,246 --> 01:15:01,070
and in what sort of state.

900
01:15:26,707 --> 01:15:29,271
I was going through my own
crisis at the time.

901
01:15:29,609 --> 01:15:31,206
I was selling off the club.

902
01:15:31,411 --> 01:15:33,245
The divorce settlement
was heavy on me,

903
01:15:33,246 --> 01:15:35,070
I was in dire straits, financially.

904
01:15:35,849 --> 01:15:38,208
Dark clouds loomed larger than ever.

905
01:15:38,552 --> 01:15:40,353
But you know what they say right...

906
01:15:40,354 --> 01:15:42,178
it's darkest just before dawn.

907
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:56,860
What's the point crying
over spilt milk?

908
01:15:58,205 --> 01:16:04,171
Raunak, what the hell are you
doing? - Stop! Stop there!

909
01:16:15,489 --> 01:16:17,823
Stop! You're finished...
you're dead!

910
01:16:17,824 --> 01:16:20,854
Why did you do this to me? Why...
tell me why!

911
01:16:20,861 --> 01:16:25,257
Who are you... who are you?
Tell me who you are!!!

912
01:16:25,532 --> 01:16:26,856
Tell me!

913
01:17:12,779 --> 01:17:15,843
Good thing you're here, Mom.
Now I'm absolutely alright.

914
01:17:15,949 --> 01:17:18,615
Just... also permanently deaf.

915
01:17:18,618 --> 01:17:22,588
No, no, no...
don't give me your filmy line

916
01:17:22,589 --> 01:17:25,187
about how God's grace might be
delayed but is never denied.

917
01:17:48,515 --> 01:17:49,839
Excuse me...

918
01:17:50,617 --> 01:17:51,941
Ma'am?

919
01:17:52,619 --> 01:17:53,943
Hello?

920
01:17:55,388 --> 01:17:56,712
Ma'am.

921
01:17:56,923 --> 01:17:59,521
Ma'am... I'm talking to...

922
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:02,987
Sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you but,

923
01:18:03,296 --> 01:18:05,530
I've been calling out to
you since then and...

924
01:18:05,765 --> 01:18:09,933
I didn't hear you. I'm deaf.

925
01:18:10,837 --> 01:18:13,196
Deaf... I...

926
01:18:15,775 --> 01:18:18,976
Really? But you don't look deaf!

927
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:23,014
How does someone LOOK deaf?

928
01:18:23,150 --> 01:18:25,611
You thought I'd have my ears missing?

929
01:18:26,486 --> 01:18:28,515
I'm missing my ears too.

930
01:18:30,223 --> 01:18:31,547
I'm deaf.

931
01:18:34,294 --> 01:18:36,152
Hey,
do you remember we've met before?

932
01:18:37,564 --> 01:18:41,493
I almost ran over you,
I was very pissed then.

933
01:18:43,837 --> 01:18:46,264
I'm sorry for that uhh...

934
01:18:47,974 --> 01:18:50,742
Gauri.

935
01:18:52,579 --> 01:18:53,903
Gauri.

936
01:19:02,189 --> 01:19:04,081
- Gauri.
- Gauri.

937
01:19:06,326 --> 01:19:08,526
I'm Raunak.

938
01:19:09,563 --> 01:19:14,926
Raunak. - Raunak... Would you
like to learn lip reading?

939
01:19:15,569 --> 01:19:18,633
- I can't...
- Lip reading.

940
01:19:26,479 --> 01:19:27,905
Lip reading.

941
01:19:32,185 --> 01:19:33,782
How much time will it take?

942
01:19:42,596 --> 01:19:43,696
Raunak, in a way...

943
01:19:43,697 --> 01:19:46,864
it's a good thing that you've
gone deaf later in life

944
01:19:46,967 --> 01:19:48,700
and weren't born that way.

945
01:19:49,336 --> 01:19:52,196
You have the memory of sound in you.

946
01:19:52,505 --> 01:19:56,571
You know what a sound or
a word sounds like.

947
01:19:56,943 --> 01:20:01,347
All you need to learn
now is to connect...

948
01:20:01,348 --> 01:20:04,446
those sounds to visuals.

949
01:20:05,118 --> 01:20:06,819
I think maybe you're
overlooking the...

950
01:20:06,820 --> 01:20:08,712
fact that I can't lip read yet.

951
01:20:08,788 --> 01:20:11,113
I can't understand what
you're saying.

952
01:20:11,324 --> 01:20:13,717
Isn't there an easier way
for us to communicate?

953
01:20:17,297 --> 01:20:18,621
Lips...

954
01:20:22,402 --> 01:20:24,837
Lips? Okay.

955
01:20:24,838 --> 01:20:29,842
You can recognise any
sound or word...

956
01:20:29,843 --> 01:20:34,443
by reading my lips or tongue.

957
01:20:35,248 --> 01:20:38,642
And of course, all facial
expressions as well, yeah?

958
01:20:50,297 --> 01:20:55,261
You need to focus on these
now and feel it.

959
01:20:55,502 --> 01:20:56,894
Shall we try?

960
01:20:57,704 --> 01:20:59,835
- Try?
- Try.

961
01:20:59,839 --> 01:21:03,108
Try... That's what I'm here for.

962
01:21:06,846 --> 01:21:08,170
Aaa...

963
01:21:11,618 --> 01:21:12,976
Vee...

964
01:21:17,457 --> 01:21:18,781
Pee...

965
01:21:19,626 --> 01:21:21,826
It could also be 'Be' right?

966
01:21:23,763 --> 01:21:25,087
Pee...

967
01:21:25,665 --> 01:21:29,924
Bee... pee... bee... Pee...

968
01:21:36,609 --> 01:21:41,937
Tuh ree... tuh ree... tree...

969
01:21:43,283 --> 01:21:48,953
Tuh ree... Gau ree... Sau ree...

970
01:21:51,558 --> 01:21:55,728
- Aaa... appple...
- A for apple.

971
01:21:55,729 --> 01:21:57,121
Buh... Baa.

972
01:21:57,163 --> 01:21:59,765
Bas! He's just like his father.
- Are you frigging deaf?

973
01:21:59,766 --> 01:22:03,469
Banjo. BHUH! - Are you hungry?
- Go to HELL!

974
01:22:03,470 --> 01:22:05,771
Sho -Naa -Lee. CHUH...

975
01:22:05,772 --> 01:22:09,341
Come on. - Chuh -CHA -CHU -Raunak
Chachu... - Charr lee...

976
01:22:09,342 --> 01:22:11,132
The honeybees...

977
01:22:11,778 --> 01:22:13,812
- Is a jerk.
- Dude!

978
01:22:13,813 --> 01:22:15,247
DHuh, Duh...

979
01:22:15,248 --> 01:22:19,385
D for desolate, D for drinking,
D is for doodoo too.

980
01:22:19,386 --> 01:22:21,687
Gaa -Gaa -Go...

981
01:22:21,688 --> 01:22:24,047
Buy Gauri some flowers.

982
01:22:24,891 --> 01:22:26,920
I've got flowers for you.

983
01:22:27,193 --> 01:22:29,051
- Foo.
- Fuh.

984
01:22:29,462 --> 01:22:31,930
Gaa -Gaa -Kaa...

985
01:22:31,931 --> 01:22:33,265
Kon -Chin -Tate!

986
01:22:33,266 --> 01:22:36,160
- Muh...
- Memory of sound.

987
01:22:36,302 --> 01:22:38,837
Muh... I've got MOM on my side.

988
01:22:38,838 --> 01:22:41,740
Suh...
- Self centered rogue, Raunak!

989
01:22:41,741 --> 01:22:43,909
Shhuh... - Chances are,
you SHALL never hear again.

990
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:45,802
Shh! She's sleeping.

991
01:22:46,212 --> 01:22:50,883
The -Ka. Tho -Ka. Dho-Ka. Vuh...

992
01:22:50,884 --> 01:22:52,208
Don't Worry.

993
01:22:52,552 --> 01:22:54,453
Vee. Whiskey.

994
01:22:54,454 --> 01:22:57,256
There's no exam for lip reading.

995
01:22:57,257 --> 01:22:59,391
RAW - -Think you're a Rockstar?

996
01:22:59,392 --> 01:23:01,182
DJ Raunak.

997
01:23:01,661 --> 01:23:03,428
Raunak,

998
01:23:04,497 --> 01:23:07,595
Raunak, Raunak.

999
01:23:08,268 --> 01:23:09,592
The...

1000
01:23:10,370 --> 01:23:11,694
Quick...

1001
01:23:12,605 --> 01:23:13,929
Brown...

1002
01:23:14,574 --> 01:23:15,898
Fox...

1003
01:23:16,676 --> 01:23:18,204
Jumps...

1004
01:23:19,412 --> 01:23:20,736
Over...

1005
01:23:21,681 --> 01:23:23,005
Lazy...

1006
01:23:23,650 --> 01:23:29,488
Dog. - The quick brown fox
jumps over the lazy dog.

1007
01:23:29,489 --> 01:23:32,758
The quick brown fox jumps
over the lazy dog.

1008
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,935
That man is pointing to his heart.

1009
01:23:42,936 --> 01:23:45,237
Oh no, no, no, he's getting
a pen from his pocket,

1010
01:23:45,238 --> 01:23:48,063
and asking the other guy
to write it down.

1011
01:23:48,775 --> 01:23:50,099
Nine...

1012
01:23:52,245 --> 01:23:54,604
Nine... B...

1013
01:23:55,849 --> 01:23:57,683
Darn it!
How the hell am I going to do it?

1014
01:23:57,684 --> 01:24:00,384
Raunak, don't panic.

1015
01:24:01,287 --> 01:24:03,646
Don't give up so soon.

1016
01:24:04,123 --> 01:24:07,415
These things are bound to take time.

1017
01:24:07,861 --> 01:24:11,697
It's difficult to understand
language without sound,

1018
01:24:11,698 --> 01:24:13,732
but not as difficult as it is for...

1019
01:24:13,733 --> 01:24:16,001
a blind man to understand colour.

1020
01:24:16,536 --> 01:24:21,640
The day will come when you
can just look at a person,

1021
01:24:21,641 --> 01:24:23,431
and know what he's saying.

1022
01:24:23,776 --> 01:24:25,677
Okay? Most important thing is...

1023
01:24:25,678 --> 01:24:28,071
get comfortable with your deafness,

1024
01:24:29,215 --> 01:24:32,075
And the fact that it's
never going to change.

1025
01:24:32,685 --> 01:24:35,587
Accept it and automatically...

1026
01:24:35,588 --> 01:24:39,881
your other senses will
become stronger.

1027
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:43,823
Your world will change, trust me.

1028
01:24:44,197 --> 01:24:46,761
I've never heard a sound in my life,

1029
01:24:47,367 --> 01:24:52,104
but I can fully appreciate
the beauty of creation.

1030
01:24:55,842 --> 01:25:00,169
Come on,
try again, with a different pair.

1031
01:25:02,348 --> 01:25:03,672
Let's practice.

1032
01:25:06,219 --> 01:25:07,352
Okay.

1033
01:25:07,353 --> 01:25:10,713
That man is demanding money from
the woman. 3 lakh rupees.

1034
01:25:10,857 --> 01:25:12,724
The woman's saying it's too much.

1035
01:25:12,725 --> 01:25:14,359
The man says the job's too risky...

1036
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:16,093
and he won't do it for any less.

1037
01:25:16,262 --> 01:25:19,656
The woman says she only
has 30 thousand.

1038
01:25:19,832 --> 01:25:23,302
The man is threatening
to torture her.

1039
01:25:23,303 --> 01:25:24,403
Oh darn, Gauri...

1040
01:25:24,404 --> 01:25:26,934
this woman's putting a contract
out on her husband.

1041
01:25:31,544 --> 01:25:34,836
Didn't you just ask me to
strengthen my other senses?

1042
01:25:34,948 --> 01:25:36,648
When everything's a blank page...

1043
01:25:36,649 --> 01:25:39,042
one resorts to imagination,
doesn't one?

1044
01:25:52,999 --> 01:25:55,062
I got you...
I got you! - Easy, easy there.

1045
01:25:55,935 --> 01:25:58,169
What did you feed him as a child,
sister-in-law?

1046
01:26:00,473 --> 01:26:02,502
I'm going to sing a song for you now.

1047
01:26:03,610 --> 01:26:07,812
Now I've gone completely deaf,
I can't hear a thing I say...

1048
01:26:07,814 --> 01:26:13,017
But even today in my heart
I can hear this tune...

1049
01:26:17,256 --> 01:26:19,251
He's still trying to make music.

1050
01:26:19,592 --> 01:26:22,087
Youth and madness,
they're one and the same thing.

1051
01:26:22,929 --> 01:26:25,754
I know you guys are talking about me.

1052
01:26:28,301 --> 01:26:29,625
Isn't it, Uncle?

1053
01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:33,800
Mom, now I'm not one bit depressed.

1054
01:26:34,907 --> 01:26:37,869
Whatever happened... bygones.

1055
01:26:38,811 --> 01:26:41,978
I don't regret anything anymore
and neither should you.

1056
01:26:42,749 --> 01:26:46,177
I've made this a NO
ENTRY for sadness.

1057
01:26:46,953 --> 01:26:49,483
What say, Uncle? Cheers?

1058
01:26:49,756 --> 01:26:51,857
Gauri had definitely spun
some magic on him.

1059
01:26:51,858 --> 01:26:55,958
Raunak wasn't telling me much
but a mother always knows.

1060
01:26:56,229 --> 01:26:57,295
He had changed.

1061
01:26:57,296 --> 01:27:00,087
Gauri, you are a rockstar.

1062
01:27:00,667 --> 01:27:02,491
ROCKSTAR!

1063
01:27:02,669 --> 01:27:07,702
This means I love you

1064
01:27:10,710 --> 01:27:13,178
I love you... I love you.

1065
01:27:13,179 --> 01:27:15,681
Hello there, what's your name?

1066
01:27:15,682 --> 01:27:16,848
I am Peter.

1067
01:27:16,849 --> 01:27:19,451
Could you up the volume, please?
I can't hear a thing.

1068
01:27:19,452 --> 01:27:20,776
Yes Ma'am.

1069
01:27:21,187 --> 01:27:23,555
I just asked him to
up the deck volume,

1070
01:27:23,556 --> 01:27:25,483
because I couldn't hear a thing.

1071
01:27:33,299 --> 01:27:35,464
Do you know how funny you look?

1072
01:27:35,468 --> 01:27:40,262
Anthony, did you see how funny
he looks when he's kissing?

1073
01:27:42,942 --> 01:27:48,202
I'm your teacher.
I can't do this with my students.

1074
01:27:53,352 --> 01:27:56,621
If you want to kiss me,

1075
01:27:56,989 --> 01:27:59,883
Then take me out first,
on a romantic date.

1076
01:28:03,596 --> 01:28:04,920
Let's go!

1077
01:28:08,634 --> 01:28:10,765
Where are you taking her?

1078
01:28:11,871 --> 01:28:16,005
I don't know.
I'll decide after I pick her up.

1079
01:28:16,442 --> 01:28:18,471
Plan to marry her?

1080
01:28:22,782 --> 01:28:24,583
Do you plan to marry her?

1081
01:28:24,584 --> 01:28:27,185
Mom! I'm taking her out on
our first date tonight.

1082
01:28:27,186 --> 01:28:28,286
Too early to talk about marriage.

1083
01:28:28,287 --> 01:28:31,181
Why? There's nothing like
'Early' if you love her.

1084
01:28:31,324 --> 01:28:33,751
Romeo and Juliet are still etched
in the world's memory.

1085
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:36,461
They only met thrice and
on the third instance...

1086
01:28:36,462 --> 01:28:37,786
they died even.

1087
01:28:37,797 --> 01:28:40,759
And you want me to get there
on my first date?

1088
01:28:42,635 --> 01:28:45,597
- Anyway, how do I look?
- Very good.

1089
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:47,963
Bye.

1090
01:29:12,665 --> 01:29:13,989
Gauri.

1091
01:29:27,613 --> 01:29:28,937
Hi.

1092
01:29:29,582 --> 01:29:32,077
Do you remember that I'm deaf?

1093
01:29:32,451 --> 01:29:34,742
There's no point banging on the door.

1094
01:29:34,954 --> 01:29:38,690
Every door in the neighborhood
will open up, except mine.

1095
01:29:38,691 --> 01:29:40,083
So how does get in?

1096
01:29:49,902 --> 01:29:51,226
WOW!

1097
01:29:51,437 --> 01:29:57,471
There's always another way and
it's usually more beautiful.

1098
01:29:58,911 --> 01:30:00,405
Shall we?

1099
01:30:06,252 --> 01:30:07,853
Good evening ma'am, good evening sir.

1100
01:30:07,854 --> 01:30:09,621
What would you like to drink?

1101
01:30:09,689 --> 01:30:14,517
One fresh lime, sweet and salt.
- Mixed.

1102
01:30:15,161 --> 01:30:17,696
Mixed. And for you, ma'am?

1103
01:30:17,697 --> 01:30:20,557
Uhh... scotch please?

1104
01:30:21,667 --> 01:30:22,991
Sure ma'am.

1105
01:30:23,169 --> 01:30:24,527
What did you order?

1106
01:30:26,505 --> 01:30:27,829
Wait and see?

1107
01:30:29,609 --> 01:30:32,207
Sir your fresh lime soda.
Ma'am your double whiskey.

1108
01:30:33,913 --> 01:30:37,614
- You ordered whiskey?
- Yeah, why?

1109
01:30:37,850 --> 01:30:39,617
No it's just...

1110
01:30:40,286 --> 01:30:41,985
I used to drink whiskey earlier.

1111
01:30:42,822 --> 01:30:46,489
Quit it.
I had visions of Johnny Joker.

1112
01:30:48,327 --> 01:30:50,891
No one ever went deaf on account
of alcohol, Raunak.

1113
01:30:50,897 --> 01:30:54,598
God gave us booze to
show he loved us.

1114
01:31:00,573 --> 01:31:03,068
Cheers to the DJ.
- And cheers to you.

1115
01:31:08,281 --> 01:31:10,981
I was talking about that DJ.

1116
01:31:20,259 --> 01:31:22,049
You miss it a lot, don't you?

1117
01:31:24,163 --> 01:31:26,164
Never wished for anything
more than music.

1118
01:31:26,165 --> 01:31:28,160
Anything less than silence
would've been okay.

1119
01:31:30,870 --> 01:31:32,569
It'll come.

1120
01:31:32,705 --> 01:31:36,168
Nonsense. Only the bill will come.

1121
01:31:42,348 --> 01:31:44,013
Miracles can happen.

1122
01:31:45,851 --> 01:31:47,914
Why are you so optimistic?

1123
01:31:48,788 --> 01:31:50,851
Because it doesn't cost a dime.

1124
01:31:59,265 --> 01:32:02,466
There's music even in these ruins.

1125
01:32:03,903 --> 01:32:06,137
This temple is around 500 years old.

1126
01:32:06,806 --> 01:32:10,675
The rulers back in the
day told the artisans

1127
01:32:10,676 --> 01:32:13,501
to create something memorable.

1128
01:32:14,380 --> 01:32:17,549
The most interesting thing is if...

1129
01:32:17,550 --> 01:32:20,876
you tap these pillars lightly,

1130
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:23,219
They emanate musical notes.

1131
01:32:32,598 --> 01:32:36,459
How does it matter when
you can't hear a thing?

1132
01:32:38,204 --> 01:32:40,768
Don't hear it. Feel it.

1133
01:32:41,607 --> 01:32:42,931
In your heart.

1134
01:32:44,477 --> 01:32:45,801
Come.

1135
01:36:31,637 --> 01:36:34,839
The world sees with its eyes,
he began to hear.

1136
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:36,767
Raunak developed an ingenious system.

1137
01:36:36,775 --> 01:36:38,476
He started studying the waveforms...

1138
01:36:38,477 --> 01:36:40,244
of the songs he knew from before.

1139
01:36:40,613 --> 01:36:43,715
He was beginning to see music
instead of hearing it.

1140
01:36:43,716 --> 01:36:47,585
He started finding the rhythm
in everyday things.

1141
01:36:47,586 --> 01:36:50,252
He immersed himself in
the music of life.

1142
01:37:20,886 --> 01:37:25,857
We will fall in love with each
other without any fear...

1143
01:37:25,858 --> 01:37:30,686
Now we both wont be scared
of this society...

1144
01:37:31,230 --> 01:37:33,631
We are in love and we have
not done any robbery

1145
01:37:33,632 --> 01:37:36,334
lts our heart that has met
now... and is joined.

1146
01:37:36,335 --> 01:37:38,970
I will do only those things that
will keep my heart happy.

1147
01:37:38,971 --> 01:37:40,966
Why are we bothered of the society!

1148
01:37:41,473 --> 01:37:46,411
We will fall in love with each
other without any fear...

1149
01:37:46,412 --> 01:37:51,547
Now we both wont be scared
of this society...

1150
01:38:12,171 --> 01:38:17,238
Hey look at them... they are
hiding and romancing!

1151
01:38:17,343 --> 01:38:22,347
What is the fun... when you
are scared from inside.

1152
01:38:22,348 --> 01:38:24,916
Now we have to look after each other.

1153
01:38:24,917 --> 01:38:27,552
Now what ever is happening... let
it be!

1154
01:38:27,553 --> 01:38:30,188
I will do only those things that
will keep my heart happy.

1155
01:38:30,189 --> 01:38:32,582
Why are we bothered of the society!

1156
01:38:32,624 --> 01:38:37,662
We will fall in love with each
other without any fear...

1157
01:38:37,663 --> 01:38:42,764
Now we both wont be scared
of this society...

1158
01:39:13,565 --> 01:39:18,636
We will fall in love with each
other without any fear...

1159
01:39:18,637 --> 01:39:23,674
Now we both wont be scared
of this society...

1160
01:39:23,675 --> 01:39:28,746
We will fall in love with each
other without any fear...

1161
01:39:28,747 --> 01:39:34,508
Now we both wont be scared
of this society...

1162
01:40:14,526 --> 01:40:15,884
Sounds good.

1163
01:40:16,795 --> 01:40:18,790
Come on, enough for the day.

1164
01:40:19,264 --> 01:40:20,724
Just give me 2 minutes.

1165
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:23,827
Hmm... NOW!

1166
01:40:24,536 --> 01:40:31,536
Or else, I'm going to run around
the whole house naked.

1167
01:40:32,778 --> 01:40:34,102
- Really?
- Hmm.

1168
01:40:34,213 --> 01:40:35,912
Then the work is done.

1169
01:40:37,583 --> 01:40:39,441
No trouble understanding that, eh?

1170
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:47,156
Come here... How do you plan to
escape me today Gauri... Stop.

1171
01:40:47,726 --> 01:40:49,050
Gauri, stop!

1172
01:40:49,261 --> 01:40:50,585
Gauri, careful!

1173
01:41:26,698 --> 01:41:28,522
I'm here to say sorry, Charlie.

1174
01:41:37,709 --> 01:41:39,874
I know you were depending on me.

1175
01:41:41,179 --> 01:41:42,503
I screwed up.

1176
01:41:47,219 --> 01:41:48,952
That's what you're apologizing for?

1177
01:41:50,255 --> 01:41:53,046
Charlie, I can't hear you.
I read lips now.

1178
01:41:53,191 --> 01:41:54,856
Is that what you're sorry for?

1179
01:41:55,827 --> 01:41:57,628
Do you seriously believe
that no one else...

1180
01:41:57,629 --> 01:41:59,463
besides you has problems in life?

1181
01:41:59,464 --> 01:42:01,527
What of Charlie's problems?
Tango!?

1182
01:42:04,136 --> 01:42:05,630
Do you know, I had to...

1183
01:42:07,272 --> 01:42:09,836
Do you know I had to sell
off my nightclub?

1184
01:42:10,909 --> 01:42:12,870
You know what it's called now?

1185
01:42:14,212 --> 01:42:15,536
'Soundtrack'!

1186
01:42:20,385 --> 01:42:22,320
I can't even say I
heard about this...

1187
01:42:22,321 --> 01:42:24,452
because I can't hear anything now.

1188
01:42:27,693 --> 01:42:30,928
Look Charlie, I'm sorry things
turned out the way they did,

1189
01:42:31,863 --> 01:42:34,461
but I can't do anything now
except apologise for it.

1190
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:36,124
Nothing at all.

1191
01:42:42,574 --> 01:42:44,466
Give this a hear please.

1192
01:42:44,943 --> 01:42:46,938
Your opinion matters to me.

1193
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:56,644
Bye.

1194
01:42:56,822 --> 01:42:58,089
I'm sorry.

1195
01:43:04,262 --> 01:43:05,896
I'm sorry you had to leave the villa.

1196
01:43:05,897 --> 01:43:08,631
My wife got it in the settlement.

1197
01:43:09,501 --> 01:43:11,166
That's quite alright Charlie.

1198
01:43:11,536 --> 01:43:15,169
The verdict on my hearing
was settled before yours.

1199
01:43:20,312 --> 01:43:23,672
Don't forget about this.
I've worked really hard.

1200
01:43:32,858 --> 01:43:35,524
Hey open the door, man.
Hey, Raunak!

1201
01:43:37,162 --> 01:43:39,555
Hey Romeo open the door, man.

1202
01:43:42,234 --> 01:43:44,195
Somebody, anybody home?

1203
01:43:45,404 --> 01:43:48,571
Look behind you. Behind you.

1204
01:43:53,812 --> 01:43:54,945
Charlie.

1205
01:43:54,946 --> 01:43:57,815
Holy darn, Raunak.
- Charlie, relax.

1206
01:43:57,816 --> 01:44:02,052
Oh, sorry.
- Charlie -Gauri, my mom.

1207
01:44:02,454 --> 01:44:03,721
- Hello.
- Hello.

1208
01:44:03,722 --> 01:44:05,046
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hi.

1209
01:44:05,357 --> 01:44:08,421
She's also deaf, like me.
- Your mom?

1210
01:44:08,493 --> 01:44:10,895
Dude, is being deaf some kind of
family business for you guys?

1211
01:44:10,896 --> 01:44:14,427
Pch...
not my mom Charlie, Gauri... Gauri.

1212
01:44:15,534 --> 01:44:18,428
- Tea?
- Charlie doesn't drink tea.

1213
01:44:18,837 --> 01:44:20,695
- Right, Charlie?
- No, no, no, no.

1214
01:44:20,806 --> 01:44:22,130
- Come.
- Lets go.

1215
01:44:22,541 --> 01:44:26,038
Ok buddy, be honest now.
Did you make this?

1216
01:44:26,111 --> 01:44:27,211
How is it?

1217
01:44:27,212 --> 01:44:29,012
What did you think, I've come
in the middle of the night

1218
01:44:29,013 --> 01:44:29,978
because I was missing you?

1219
01:44:30,182 --> 01:44:33,451
Charlie, please tell me how it
is... I've never heard it.

1220
01:44:33,452 --> 01:44:35,186
What do you mean you
haven't heard it.

1221
01:44:35,187 --> 01:44:37,614
Charlie, I'm completely deaf.

1222
01:44:38,824 --> 01:44:41,922
- Completely?
- Pin drop silence.

1223
01:44:42,728 --> 01:44:45,019
Then this?

1224
01:44:45,597 --> 01:44:50,527
Charlie,
I can't hear, but I can hear.

1225
01:44:50,869 --> 01:44:54,866
Oh man... bro... bro come here, man.

1226
01:44:57,809 --> 01:45:00,277
This is good... this is darn good!

1227
01:45:00,278 --> 01:45:02,813
This is DAMN GOOD.
You have no idea how...

1228
01:45:02,814 --> 01:45:07,710
Charlie relax, control. I can't
hear you, no point shouting.

1229
01:45:07,753 --> 01:45:09,680
Oh, oh, okay. Good, good, good.

1230
01:45:09,821 --> 01:45:11,589
Boss you have no idea
how good this is.

1231
01:45:11,590 --> 01:45:12,890
When we release this album,

1232
01:45:12,891 --> 01:45:14,658
It's going to make you a
superstar, overnight.

1233
01:45:14,659 --> 01:45:16,660
And folks DIG your kind of triumph...

1234
01:45:16,661 --> 01:45:18,596
of the human spirit stories.

1235
01:45:18,597 --> 01:45:21,525
You watch reality shows right?
Yeah!

1236
01:45:22,667 --> 01:45:23,991
Charlie,

1237
01:45:24,970 --> 01:45:28,839
I don't think we should tell
people about my handicap.

1238
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:32,906
Why not?
- I don't want any charity.

1239
01:45:33,912 --> 01:45:36,772
Bro, are you kidding me?

1240
01:45:37,215 --> 01:45:40,746
Musicians are a dime-a-dozen
in this town.

1241
01:45:41,987 --> 01:45:44,889
Has anyone ever heard of a deaf
composer around here? No!

1242
01:45:44,890 --> 01:45:48,893
That's exactly what we should
take advantage of.

1243
01:45:48,894 --> 01:45:50,593
Wisen up my boy!

1244
01:45:51,630 --> 01:45:55,933
Charlie, all I want to know
is if my music is good...

1245
01:45:55,934 --> 01:45:57,768
despite my deafness.

1246
01:45:57,769 --> 01:45:59,703
Oh my love, take it from me...
screw me.

1247
01:45:59,704 --> 01:46:01,939
Take it in writing from a guy
with an ear for music.

1248
01:46:01,940 --> 01:46:06,802
You are going to be a role model
for people, definitely.

1249
01:46:07,279 --> 01:46:09,444
They'll even make feature
films on your life!

1250
01:46:09,581 --> 01:46:12,748
Get your make up on, buddy.

1251
01:46:13,718 --> 01:46:16,714
Roll camera, sound...

1252
01:46:17,956 --> 01:46:21,191
Sorry, no sound, action!

1253
01:46:21,660 --> 01:46:23,894
I was going through a dark phase.

1254
01:46:29,835 --> 01:46:32,535
And then I discovered
genuine brightness.

1255
01:46:32,604 --> 01:46:37,102
I took to the New Emami Fair and
Handsome, especially for Men.

1256
01:46:37,242 --> 01:46:39,476
Hi Handsome... Hi handsome.

1257
01:46:39,477 --> 01:46:42,613
And I found what I was looking for.

1258
01:46:42,614 --> 01:46:44,415
Hi Handsome.

1259
01:46:44,416 --> 01:46:45,910
Do you hear me?

1260
01:46:45,984 --> 01:46:48,013
Cut... pack up!

1261
01:46:51,356 --> 01:46:53,055
What's up? Lost your marbles?

1262
01:46:53,959 --> 01:46:55,749
Why is your hair red?

1263
01:46:58,630 --> 01:47:00,488
Want me to talk about your nest?

1264
01:47:00,699 --> 01:47:02,266
Ever slide my hand in there...

1265
01:47:02,267 --> 01:47:04,694
a pair of sparrows might
come flying out.

1266
01:47:05,871 --> 01:47:07,571
Want me to talk about your face?

1267
01:47:07,572 --> 01:47:09,373
Looks like you were made in a lab.

1268
01:47:09,374 --> 01:47:11,767
Now you're talking just
like my ex-girlfriend.

1269
01:47:12,244 --> 01:47:14,637
Shouldn't have broken up with her.

1270
01:47:15,513 --> 01:47:17,110
Truth hurts, doesn't it?

1271
01:47:18,583 --> 01:47:20,180
Does it, does it?

1272
01:47:22,387 --> 01:47:25,679
Now you're talking just
like my future wife.

1273
01:47:27,592 --> 01:47:29,257
Was that your proposal?

1274
01:47:30,695 --> 01:47:33,862
Well,
I thought you were a fast learner,

1275
01:47:33,965 --> 01:47:36,300
but now,
it looks like I'm going to...

1276
01:47:36,301 --> 01:47:38,402
have to stay and teach you stuff,

1277
01:47:38,403 --> 01:47:40,261
All life long.

1278
01:47:40,438 --> 01:47:43,866
So does that amount to acceptance?

1279
01:47:48,380 --> 01:47:49,704
Your highness...

1280
01:47:49,748 --> 01:47:51,072
Here he is.

1281
01:47:51,216 --> 01:47:53,384
Hey, the king and queen of subtitles.

1282
01:47:53,385 --> 01:47:55,452
Charlie, what the hell is
all this ruckus about?

1283
01:47:55,453 --> 01:47:57,220
- I don't like any of this.
- Please.

1284
01:47:57,255 --> 01:47:59,216
- Here you go.
- What's this now?

1285
01:47:59,491 --> 01:48:02,089
Keys to my villa.
I want you to keep it.

1286
01:48:03,895 --> 01:48:07,028
- Keep it?
- Yeah. Keep it.

1287
01:48:07,299 --> 01:48:10,466
You only gave me a doll for the
first album. This time, keys?

1288
01:48:10,669 --> 01:48:12,231
Aah, the doll reminds me...

1289
01:48:14,472 --> 01:48:15,796
Ta-daan.

1290
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:18,938
The Raunak action figure,
version 2.0.

1291
01:48:20,612 --> 01:48:22,613
Pa-dum... how it is?

1292
01:48:22,614 --> 01:48:25,178
How is Raunak?

1293
01:48:25,951 --> 01:48:28,886
Charlie, I don't want any of
this showbiz stuff now.

1294
01:48:28,887 --> 01:48:30,154
Hey listen, come on brother, please.

1295
01:48:30,155 --> 01:48:31,588
I really don't have the
time for all this...

1296
01:48:31,589 --> 01:48:33,290
Charlie I don't want any of this...
- Please, mate.

1297
01:48:33,291 --> 01:48:35,326
The press is on its way,
I have to go receive them.

1298
01:48:35,327 --> 01:48:36,924
You also get ready okay? Bye.

1299
01:48:50,442 --> 01:48:52,972
He's doing all this for the
publicity. - Exactly my point.

1300
01:48:53,545 --> 01:48:54,869
Hi,

1301
01:48:55,647 --> 01:48:56,914
Okay.

1302
01:48:56,915 --> 01:49:00,013
Welcome ladies and gentlemen.
Thanks for coming.

1303
01:49:01,486 --> 01:49:05,984
Well, just two years ago,
he came to our city,

1304
01:49:06,424 --> 01:49:09,591
Armed only with a bagpack
and a guitar.

1305
01:49:10,328 --> 01:49:14,631
Today we have with us a role
model and an inspiration.

1306
01:49:14,632 --> 01:49:17,457
Ladies and gentlemen, Raunak Kaul.

1307
01:49:21,806 --> 01:49:25,837
Now you can ask him your
questions directly.

1308
01:49:26,611 --> 01:49:28,512
And don't worry,
he can read your lips.

1309
01:49:28,513 --> 01:49:30,075
- Yes, ma'am.
- Sir... over hear!

1310
01:49:31,182 --> 01:49:33,484
You could hear once, now you're deaf.

1311
01:49:33,485 --> 01:49:35,582
How does that make you feel?

1312
01:49:35,754 --> 01:49:37,919
From where you are,
I may be deaf to you.

1313
01:49:38,490 --> 01:49:40,815
Similarly, you're mute to
me, from where I am.

1314
01:49:41,159 --> 01:49:44,528
Nothing has changed,
except my perspective.

1315
01:49:44,529 --> 01:49:46,558
Whoa, I say Raunak!

1316
01:49:48,233 --> 01:49:52,569
But how can a deaf man compose
music? How is it possible?

1317
01:49:52,570 --> 01:49:54,705
Everything is possible if you
want to make it possible.

1318
01:49:54,706 --> 01:49:57,207
Who made the rules that a deaf
man can't compose music?

1319
01:49:57,208 --> 01:49:59,476
Didn't Beethoven?
- Uhh, excuse me, hello...

1320
01:49:59,477 --> 01:50:02,143
are you comparing yourself
to Beethoven?

1321
01:50:02,347 --> 01:50:05,616
No. I'm not likening
myself to Beethoven.

1322
01:50:05,617 --> 01:50:10,013
All I'm trying to say is you don't
need ears to make music,

1323
01:50:10,255 --> 01:50:14,514
You need soul. And I'm not here
for any publicity either.

1324
01:50:15,226 --> 01:50:17,428
I made this album at a point when...

1325
01:50:17,429 --> 01:50:19,530
I'd lost my hearing completely.

1326
01:50:19,531 --> 01:50:20,864
I had some unproduced stuff of my...

1327
01:50:20,865 --> 01:50:23,600
father's which I've recreated.
- In my own way. That's it!

1328
01:50:23,601 --> 01:50:26,165
But how do we believe that
you produced this indeed?

1329
01:50:26,171 --> 01:50:27,304
Be my guest not to.

1330
01:50:27,305 --> 01:50:29,640
I don't need to prove jackshit
to you subwoofers!

1331
01:50:29,641 --> 01:50:30,941
Go home, the lot of you.

1332
01:50:30,942 --> 01:50:32,643
I don't need to prove myself
to these people, Charlie.

1333
01:50:32,644 --> 01:50:37,574
Hey Raunak, come back man, where
are you going? - Stop it.

1334
01:50:37,582 --> 01:50:40,009
He is insulting us.

1335
01:50:40,185 --> 01:50:41,918
Hey Raunak, come back, man!
Darn it?

1336
01:50:42,854 --> 01:50:44,721
You can't talk to the
press like this.

1337
01:50:44,722 --> 01:50:48,014
Come on guys, sit down, please...

1338
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:51,958
He's a creative guy, an artist.

1339
01:50:52,764 --> 01:50:55,833
There was certainly no need
to be rude with him.

1340
01:50:55,834 --> 01:50:58,102
Rude!
Here's another callous comment.

1341
01:50:58,203 --> 01:51:00,437
You're the one saying he's deaf,
he's saying he's deaf.

1342
01:51:00,438 --> 01:51:03,407
All we want to know is how he's
composed music being deaf.

1343
01:51:03,408 --> 01:51:04,775
Or else, this is a publicity stunt?

1344
01:51:04,776 --> 01:51:08,412
Hey, come on, Raunak Kaul
is deaf for a fact,

1345
01:51:08,413 --> 01:51:12,843
And he has produced this album
in his state of deafness.

1346
01:51:13,685 --> 01:51:15,475
Trust me on this, brother.

1347
01:51:16,488 --> 01:51:21,825
I mean, here's a guy who
overcomes his handicap

1348
01:51:21,826 --> 01:51:23,494
and emerges as a shining example,

1349
01:51:23,495 --> 01:51:25,558
A role model,
an inspiration for others.

1350
01:51:26,231 --> 01:51:30,968
Yet he has to prove his talent,
his abilities to us folks.

1351
01:51:31,336 --> 01:51:32,803
Folks like us, who've got what

1352
01:51:32,804 --> 01:51:35,095
not even jackshit to
show for ourselves.

1353
01:51:35,140 --> 01:51:37,174
Come on man, being a deaf musician

1354
01:51:37,175 --> 01:51:38,942
is tougher than being
a one-legged...

1355
01:51:38,943 --> 01:51:40,938
footballer or a blind painter.

1356
01:51:41,446 --> 01:51:43,847
Just because he looks
normal doesn't...

1357
01:51:43,848 --> 01:51:45,979
mean he isn't handicapped.

1358
01:51:46,351 --> 01:51:47,675
You got to...

1359
01:51:47,785 --> 01:51:49,820
I think we should go ahead
and do the concert... l...

1360
01:51:49,821 --> 01:51:51,555
have the clearance... we
can do this.

1361
01:51:51,556 --> 01:51:53,084
Let us do it man.

1362
01:51:53,958 --> 01:51:58,786
Excuse me, sir?
You wanted proof? You'll have it.

1363
01:51:58,897 --> 01:52:00,797
Ladies and gentlemen...

1364
01:52:00,798 --> 01:52:04,568
Raunak Kaul will perform
LIVE in concert,

1365
01:52:04,569 --> 01:52:05,893
Saturday night!

1366
01:52:07,906 --> 01:52:09,173
He's the man.

1367
01:52:09,174 --> 01:52:12,443
He's a genius and he's
a true blue rockstar.

1368
01:52:12,744 --> 01:52:15,478
Rumor has it that to convince
Raunak to perform in concert,

1369
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:17,475
Charlie had to shave
off all his hair.

1370
01:52:18,883 --> 01:52:20,207
ALL OF IT!

1371
01:52:20,518 --> 01:52:22,219
This world is a small place...

1372
01:52:22,220 --> 01:52:25,222
every where there are roads
that are already known...

1373
01:52:25,223 --> 01:52:28,192
I hope to meet you some day soon!

1374
01:52:28,193 --> 01:52:32,896
I am sure to meet you some
day... and I will ask how you are?

1375
01:52:48,179 --> 01:52:49,503
Goodluck.

1376
01:52:50,582 --> 01:52:53,578
I'm going to feel a little less
nervous with you two around.

1377
01:52:59,691 --> 01:53:01,049
What an evening.

1378
01:53:01,559 --> 01:53:04,555
Some new faces, some old friends.
- Thank you so much for coming.

1379
01:53:04,796 --> 01:53:06,830
I would like to thank our sponsors...

1380
01:53:06,831 --> 01:53:09,122
especially our music label Saregama,

1381
01:53:09,300 --> 01:53:11,568
for believing in us and giving
us this opportunity.

1382
01:53:11,836 --> 01:53:13,763
And now without any further ado,

1383
01:53:13,871 --> 01:53:17,800
Please welcome the man who makes
handicapped people look cool.

1384
01:53:17,909 --> 01:53:20,677
Beethoven from Bandra, Raunak Kaul.

1385
01:53:24,315 --> 01:53:26,048
This is it bro, I believe in you.

1386
01:53:31,723 --> 01:53:33,115
Yayy Raunak.

1387
01:53:36,494 --> 01:53:38,421
Can you guys hear me?

1388
01:53:40,498 --> 01:53:42,698
But I can't hear you.

1389
01:53:42,734 --> 01:53:45,002
So please applaud as loud as you can.

1390
01:53:46,237 --> 01:53:49,597
Some people believe
that I'm not deaf.

1391
01:53:49,941 --> 01:53:52,141
I don't quite care about
what they have to say.

1392
01:53:52,343 --> 01:53:54,702
And some others who
think I can't hear,

1393
01:53:55,179 --> 01:53:58,004
might feel sympathy for me,
at how unfortunate I am.

1394
01:54:00,084 --> 01:54:03,012
But I think I'm a very fortunate man.

1395
01:54:03,354 --> 01:54:05,088
How many people get
to realise their...

1396
01:54:05,089 --> 01:54:06,720
father's unfulfilled dreams.

1397
01:54:07,125 --> 01:54:08,449
So thanks papa...

1398
01:54:09,327 --> 01:54:11,527
What an inheritance you've
left me indeed.

1399
01:54:12,897 --> 01:54:16,132
For a while back there,
I'd badly lost my way.

1400
01:54:16,834 --> 01:54:19,534
And there was a certain someone
who shone the light upon me.

1401
01:54:19,837 --> 01:54:24,039
Literally. Tonight is my turn.

1402
01:55:42,420 --> 01:55:44,855
I belong to her... and
she belongs to me.

1403
01:55:44,856 --> 01:55:47,224
Whether a desert or an ocean
comes between us...

1404
01:55:47,225 --> 01:55:49,693
I belong to her... and
she belongs to me.

1405
01:55:49,694 --> 01:55:51,795
Whether a desert or an ocean
comes between us...

1406
01:55:51,796 --> 01:55:57,090
Whether there is a distance or
friendship its between us

1407
01:56:01,539 --> 01:56:03,940
I belong to her... and
she belongs to me.

1408
01:56:03,941 --> 01:56:06,276
Whether a desert or an ocean
comes between us...

1409
01:56:06,277 --> 01:56:08,745
I belong to her... and
she belongs to me.

1410
01:56:08,746 --> 01:56:10,881
Whether a desert or an ocean
comes between us...

1411
01:56:10,882 --> 01:56:16,449
Whether there is a distance or
friendship its between us

1412
01:56:20,758 --> 01:56:23,326
I have seen many lovers,
but no one as manic as me.

1413
01:56:23,327 --> 01:56:25,796
There may be many daggers,
but only one needed to slay

1414
01:56:25,797 --> 01:56:26,930
I have been through many storms...

1415
01:56:26,931 --> 01:56:28,165
but always found one safe shore

1416
01:56:28,166 --> 01:56:30,634
I know that it takes many beads
to make one single anklet

1417
01:56:30,635 --> 01:56:32,936
I have heard many ballads
sung in one concert

1418
01:56:32,937 --> 01:56:35,405
I have seen many fools being
led by one wise man

1419
01:56:35,406 --> 01:56:37,574
I have been down many roads but
I have one destination...

1420
01:56:37,575 --> 01:56:40,241
one destination, one destination

1421
01:57:13,744 --> 01:57:16,146
I belong to her... and
she belongs to me.

1422
01:57:16,147 --> 01:57:18,281
Whether a desert or an ocean
comes between us...

1423
01:57:18,282 --> 01:57:20,750
Whatever is hers is mine...

1424
01:57:20,751 --> 01:57:22,819
Whether a desert or an ocean
comes between us...

1425
01:57:22,820 --> 01:57:28,820
Whether there is a distance or
friendship its between us

1426
01:57:32,697 --> 01:57:35,565
I have seen many lovers,
but no one as manic as me.

1427
01:57:35,566 --> 01:57:37,767
There are many religions,
but a believer needs only one

1428
01:57:37,768 --> 01:57:38,568
I have many desires...

1429
01:57:38,569 --> 01:57:40,270
but only one that has
yet to be realized.

1430
01:57:40,271 --> 01:57:42,539
There may be many eyes, one bit
of kohl can beautify them all.

1431
01:57:42,540 --> 01:57:44,941
I know that many uneducated can
be taught by one teacher.

1432
01:57:44,942 --> 01:57:46,176
There may be many who hide the truth.

1433
01:57:46,177 --> 01:57:47,344
It takes just one to convince them...

1434
01:57:47,345 --> 01:57:49,679
I have been down many roads but
I have one destination...

1435
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:52,574
One destination, one destination,

1436
01:58:11,402 --> 01:58:13,603
whatever is hers is mine...

1437
01:58:13,604 --> 01:58:15,805
Whether a desert or an ocean
comes between us...

1438
01:58:15,806 --> 01:58:18,408
Whatever is hers is mine...

1439
01:58:18,409 --> 01:58:20,577
Whether a desert or an ocean
comes between us...

1440
01:58:20,578 --> 01:58:25,838
Whether there is a distance or
friendship its between us

1441
01:58:30,388 --> 01:58:32,956
I have seen many lovers,
but no one as manic as me.

1442
01:58:32,957 --> 01:58:35,592
There may be many daggers,
but only one needed to slay

1443
01:58:35,593 --> 01:58:36,693
I have been through many storms...

1444
01:58:36,694 --> 01:58:37,794
but always found one safe shore

1445
01:58:37,795 --> 01:58:40,256
I know that it takes many beads
to make one single anklet

1446
01:58:40,264 --> 01:58:42,566
I have heard many ballads
sung in one concert

1447
01:58:42,567 --> 01:58:44,968
I have seen many fools being
led by one wise man

1448
01:58:44,969 --> 01:58:47,370
I have been down many roads but
I have one destination...

1449
01:58:47,371 --> 01:58:49,773
One destination, one destination.

1450
01:58:49,774 --> 01:58:52,275
One destination, one destination.

1451
01:58:52,276 --> 01:58:55,010
One destination, one destination.

1452
01:59:10,795 --> 01:59:14,664
Raunak, Raunak, Raunak...

1453
01:59:14,665 --> 01:59:17,934
Raunak, Raunak, Raunak...

1454
01:59:17,935 --> 01:59:19,964
Raunak, Raunak, Raunak...

1455
01:59:22,607 --> 01:59:24,374
Excuse me, excuse me.

1456
01:59:24,375 --> 01:59:26,276
Thank you, thank you...
excuse me, excuse me...

1457
01:59:26,277 --> 01:59:28,845
Excuse me, excuse me...

1458
01:59:28,846 --> 01:59:31,512
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1459
01:59:31,682 --> 01:59:33,950
- You want Raunak Kaul?
- Yes!

1460
01:59:35,252 --> 01:59:38,955
Well, I'm Charlie... and only
Charlie can get you Raunak Kaul.

1461
01:59:38,956 --> 01:59:41,781
So wait here,
I'm going to get you Raunak Kaul.

1462
01:59:42,360 --> 01:59:43,752
Call him -Raunak!

1463
01:59:43,761 --> 01:59:45,595
Raunak, Raunak, Raunak...

1464
01:59:45,596 --> 01:59:47,364
Raunak, Raunak, Raunak...

1465
01:59:47,365 --> 01:59:49,799
Raunak, hey Raunak!
Where are you, mate?

1466
01:59:49,800 --> 01:59:52,125
Hey rockstar, come on out, man.
Where are you mate?

1467
01:59:52,169 --> 01:59:56,306
Raunak? Bhan...
Whatta show man, whatta show!

1468
01:59:56,307 --> 01:59:57,938
Where's Raunak? In the restroom?

1469
01:59:58,409 --> 02:00:00,477
He's gone.
- What do you mean he's gone, dude?

1470
02:00:00,478 --> 02:00:01,845
The entire media's waiting
outside for him.

1471
02:00:01,846 --> 02:00:03,880
I've promised them I'm going
to get them Raunak.

1472
02:00:03,881 --> 02:00:06,750
Man, whatta show!
- We're going live in a half hour.

1473
02:00:06,751 --> 02:00:09,713
Don't kid around now...
where's Raunak? - Charlie...

1474
02:00:10,755 --> 02:00:12,079
Raunak is gone.

1475
02:00:25,536 --> 02:00:27,470
We'd never had such a tremendous
performance...

1476
02:00:27,471 --> 02:00:30,569
even before he went deaf.
- It was so nice... amazing.

1477
02:00:31,742 --> 02:00:33,202
And then, he disappears!

1478
02:00:34,245 --> 02:00:35,812
Gone! Poof!

1479
02:00:35,813 --> 02:00:38,248
There was a lot of buzz in the
circuit about where he went.

1480
02:00:38,249 --> 02:00:39,616
You know some say they
saw him here...

1481
02:00:39,617 --> 02:00:40,784
some say they saw him there.

1482
02:00:40,785 --> 02:00:42,819
I once saw him in the
New York subway.

1483
02:00:42,820 --> 02:00:45,955
He was playing the guitar...
and I thought to myself,

1484
02:00:45,956 --> 02:00:47,490
'Man, this guy is so incredible'.

1485
02:00:47,491 --> 02:00:50,692
I wondered why our Indian Idol
was sitting idle in America.

1486
02:00:50,761 --> 02:00:53,461
Raunak, a beggar? No.

1487
02:00:53,631 --> 02:00:56,499
I was in Ladakh for a
medical conference.

1488
02:00:56,500 --> 02:00:59,469
They'd sent me from here,
specially. - So I was driving past...

1489
02:00:59,470 --> 02:01:01,704
in my car and some Lhamas crossed me,

1490
02:01:02,907 --> 02:01:06,540
and I went, hey, that's Mr. Kaul...

1491
02:01:06,577 --> 02:01:08,611
So I even gave him a shout out,
'Mr. Kaul... '

1492
02:01:08,612 --> 02:01:11,247
But, I forgot that he was deaf.

1493
02:01:11,248 --> 02:01:14,210
Raunak, a Lhama? No.

1494
02:01:14,385 --> 02:01:15,552
I mean, I'm sure...

1495
02:01:15,553 --> 02:01:18,879
I can positively say that
MAYBE I've seen him.

1496
02:01:18,923 --> 02:01:20,690
I have no idea.

1497
02:01:21,459 --> 02:01:22,826
But you should ask Charlie.

1498
02:01:22,827 --> 02:01:25,618
A few years ago,
we'd gone to Kathmandu for a show.

1499
02:01:25,629 --> 02:01:27,564
Now you can't carry dope
from here, can you?

1500
02:01:27,565 --> 02:01:29,933
So we met a dealer there.
He offered us a discount.

1501
02:01:29,934 --> 02:01:31,428
Ask why.

1502
02:01:31,535 --> 02:01:33,860
Cos he'd seen our picture
in his boss' house.

1503
02:01:34,338 --> 02:01:35,696
Who could that be?

1504
02:01:36,240 --> 02:01:37,507
Kaiser Shoze...

1505
02:01:37,508 --> 02:01:41,039
Raunak, a drug dealer? No... Uhh...

1506
02:01:43,914 --> 02:01:45,749
There was a lot of discussion
but no...

1507
02:01:45,750 --> 02:01:47,711
one could say anything for sure.

1508
02:01:48,252 --> 02:01:50,645
He just upped and vanished one
day. Could be anywhere.

1509
02:02:11,909 --> 02:02:15,770
I want to share a lovely story...

1510
02:02:17,715 --> 02:02:21,644
This story does not have any words...

1511
02:02:23,454 --> 02:02:27,485
But still we could hear...

1512
02:02:29,226 --> 02:02:32,962
The person who wrote this
story... we have no address too.

1513
02:02:34,632 --> 02:02:37,233
And once every 6-8 months...

1514
02:02:37,234 --> 02:02:41,698
I get a cd which tells
me that that moron...

1515
02:02:42,273 --> 02:02:44,165
Is out there somewhere.

1516
02:02:45,810 --> 02:02:49,443
Long as there's music,
there's Raunak.

1517
02:02:52,349 --> 02:02:54,116
Yes... this is a story...

1518
02:02:54,185 --> 02:02:57,215
a different story and
it belongs to me...

1519
02:02:57,888 --> 02:03:02,358
I have my freedom... in
this life...

1520
02:03:02,359 --> 02:03:08,131
Now please take me to the
heavens... where ever it is...

1521
02:03:08,132 --> 02:03:11,334
O the little voices are calling me...

1522
02:03:11,335 --> 02:03:13,803
Yes... they are calling me...

1523
02:03:13,804 --> 02:03:19,609
Now take me to the heavens...

1524
02:03:19,610 --> 02:03:24,973
Now voices come... and try
calling me there...

1525
02:03:26,550 --> 02:03:28,215
Raunak achieved the impossible.

1526
02:03:28,485 --> 02:03:30,480
What more inspiration
can one ask for?

1527
02:03:30,588 --> 02:03:33,516
Raunak had talent,
serious talent but...

1528
02:03:33,891 --> 02:03:36,526
Raunak had great style, great flair.

1529
02:03:36,527 --> 02:03:38,727
I wish I could be like him.

1530
02:03:38,863 --> 02:03:42,462
A deaf guy who became such a
big part of this industry.

1531
02:03:42,766 --> 02:03:46,035
It's quite incredible. - He taught
us that whatever you do,

1532
02:03:46,136 --> 02:03:49,839
Pursue it with passion, absolute
passion and never give up.

1533
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:53,598
My life is discribed
in just few words...

1534
02:04:01,418 --> 02:04:05,119
I just don't have anything to hide...

1535
02:04:06,891 --> 02:04:10,957
I have pen marks on the
blancket of life.

1536
02:04:12,796 --> 02:04:17,795
Yes... thats my story...

1537
02:04:18,636 --> 02:04:22,839
Yes... I have my freedom with
this life of mine...

1538
02:04:22,840 --> 02:04:28,745
Take me... to the Heaven... after
all...

1539
02:04:28,746 --> 02:04:31,915
Now come little voices call for me.

1540
02:04:31,916 --> 02:04:34,484
Call me...

1541
02:04:34,485 --> 02:04:40,256
Take me... to the Heaven... after
all...

1542
02:04:40,257 --> 02:04:43,459
Now come little voices call for me.

1543
02:04:43,460 --> 02:04:46,752
Call me...

1544
02:04:46,777 --> 02:04:50,777
