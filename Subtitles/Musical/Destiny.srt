Languedoc - 12th century

Joseph, my son!
Take your mother and go!

"By order of the Holy Church
of Languedoc,

the Tribunal of the lnquistion

00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:57,289
sentences the heretic
Gerard Breuil

6
00:02:57,975 --> 00:03:01,650
to be burnt at the stake,
along with all his writings,

7
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:05,168
for straying from the way
of Our Lord

8
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:08,811
and translating the work
of the heretic Averroes"

00:06:07,495 --> 00:06:08,928
Joseph...

11
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,853
your mother is dead

12
00:06:11,255 --> 00:06:12,210
Calm down

13
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:14,770
Go.. l'll take care
of everything

Long live Caliph Mansur!

17
00:06:50,095 --> 00:06:52,290
Long live the victor
of Alarcos!

18
00:06:54,895 --> 00:06:56,294
You praise him,
like these infidels?

19
00:06:56,855 --> 00:07:00,165
l have orders:
flatter him until he bursts

20
00:07:07,615 --> 00:07:08,411
Join in!

21
00:07:32,575 --> 00:07:33,690
l'll give you 5 dinars

22
00:07:33,975 --> 00:07:37,445
Are you joking?
This book comes from Baghdad!

23
00:07:37,815 --> 00:07:40,409
The Caliph would pay

24
00:07:42,855 --> 00:07:43,731
l'll buy it

25
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:47,013
lf l don't buy it for the Caliph'
library, he'll slay me

26
00:07:48,215 --> 00:07:50,604
l need it for my studies.
l can barely

27
00:07:50,815 --> 00:07:51,691
afford it

28
00:07:55,695 --> 00:07:56,684
For your studies?

29
00:07:57,055 --> 00:07:58,170
Then take it. lt's yours

30
00:08:03,295 --> 00:08:05,604
l'll let you have it
for 7 dinars

31
00:08:07,135 --> 00:08:08,568
All l have is five

32
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:11,724
You've earned it, wretch

33
00:08:15,175 --> 00:08:17,484
Where can l find Averroes,
the High Judge?

34
00:08:19,215 --> 00:08:21,251
He's my teacher.
l'll take you to him

35
00:08:24,095 --> 00:08:25,972
Wasting such blue eyes
on a boy..

36
00:08:26,175 --> 00:08:27,574
how unfair!

37
00:08:29,495 --> 00:08:32,009
Eat! You're all skin
and bones!

38
00:08:33,015 --> 00:08:34,494
There's enough for an army!

39
00:08:34,695 --> 00:08:36,811
She complains that l'm stingy

40
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:38,733
but she feeds the whole
neighborhood

41
00:08:40,015 --> 00:08:42,734
lf it weren't for me,
you'd all look like him!

42
00:08:43,095 --> 00:08:44,369
Our eyes would turn blue?

43
00:08:46,935 --> 00:08:49,927
Don't take another bite.
Manuela will put a curse

44
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,408
on anyone who doesn't taste
her biscuits

45
00:08:53,815 --> 00:08:56,568
She's challenging me again?
Go get my date bread

46
00:08:56,935 --> 00:08:59,688
Just one bite and she'll
turn green with envy

47
00:08:59,895 --> 00:09:02,011
- Take it to her
- l'm no delivery boy!

48
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,925
l'm the son of the Caliph!

49
00:09:05,175 --> 00:09:06,494
As modest as his father

50
00:09:06,975 --> 00:09:08,374
Tell on me then, Uncle!

51
00:09:08,655 --> 00:09:10,964
lf l were your father,
l'd disown you!

52
00:09:11,295 --> 00:09:12,250
l'm going dancing!

53
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:15,129
Unbelievable! The Caliph's son
wants to be a dancer!

54
00:09:16,135 --> 00:09:17,204
We call this culture?

55
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:20,725
At his age, l could dance
for three days straight!

56
00:09:21,135 --> 00:09:24,605
Come to the inn, Blue Eyes, or
they'll stuff you till you burst

57
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:26,524
l should stay

58
00:09:26,735 --> 00:09:28,293
l'm warning you..

59
00:09:29,015 --> 00:09:31,210
they go to bed
when the sun sets

60
00:09:32,855 --> 00:09:34,811
Abdallah, you forgot these

61
00:09:42,055 --> 00:09:44,808
l'll lock you in a dungeon
filled with books!

62
00:10:01,015 --> 00:10:02,004
Finally...

63
00:10:02,255 --> 00:10:03,290
ls Your Highness sick?

64
00:10:03,495 --> 00:10:05,292
Do l have to be sick
to see you?

65
00:10:06,135 --> 00:10:07,124
Let's play

66
00:10:07,455 --> 00:10:09,366
- At this hour?
- l can't sleep

67
00:10:09,935 --> 00:10:12,005
l've been back from the war
for four days

68
00:10:12,735 --> 00:10:13,770
Where were you?

69
00:10:14,135 --> 00:10:14,806
What's wrong?

70
00:10:17,055 --> 00:10:19,364
lt's my sons,
Nasser and Abdallah

71
00:10:20,095 --> 00:10:21,084
They're failures

72
00:10:21,615 --> 00:10:23,492
You're finally thinking
about them!

73
00:10:24,255 --> 00:10:26,007
They're vulnerable

74
00:10:27,655 --> 00:10:29,293
What do you expect of them?

75
00:10:29,615 --> 00:10:32,891
What do you want them to be:
thinking men or lackeys?

76
00:10:33,695 --> 00:10:35,492
l've run circles around
the Spaniards

77
00:10:36,015 --> 00:10:38,324
- We're talking about your sons
- You're obsessed!

78
00:10:38,535 --> 00:10:39,809
You're the one who's worried!

79
00:10:44,015 --> 00:10:46,654
All that interests Nasser
is horses and girls

80
00:10:48,335 --> 00:10:50,166
And Abdallah is beyond
all hope

81
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:53,004
lf l lock him in his room,
he escapes

82
00:10:54,255 --> 00:10:55,813
l threaten him..

83
00:10:56,135 --> 00:10:58,888
l even beat him,
but it's hopeless

84
00:10:59,095 --> 00:10:59,971
He slips away

85
00:11:00,175 --> 00:11:01,733
Give him real responsibilities

86
00:11:02,215 --> 00:11:04,046
You treat him
like a mere servant

87
00:11:04,815 --> 00:11:05,531
All he's good for..

88
00:11:05,735 --> 00:11:06,611
is gypsy dancing

89
00:11:06,895 --> 00:11:08,328
lf you saw how he danced..

90
00:11:08,975 --> 00:11:09,771
Dancing!

91
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:11,923
My son, a dancer!

92
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:14,534
And what if he's happy dancing?

93
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:17,968
When my daughter disagrees
with me,

94
00:11:18,215 --> 00:11:19,728
she just blurts out:
"You're wrong!"

95
00:11:24,135 --> 00:11:25,807
lnstead of being
our children's enemies,

96
00:11:26,535 --> 00:11:28,207
let's try to persuade them

97
00:11:28,615 --> 00:11:31,175
Childish soul-searching
pales in comparison

98
00:11:31,895 --> 00:11:33,294
with the reality of Conquest!

99
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:35,569
Checkmate

100
00:11:36,335 --> 00:11:37,211
All the better!

101
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,486
You see? l'm unbeatable!

102
00:11:39,695 --> 00:11:40,525
Goodnight

103
00:11:40,735 --> 00:11:41,929
Stay and learn to play

104
00:11:42,215 --> 00:11:44,171
lf l don't get to bed,
l'll collapse

105
00:11:44,535 --> 00:11:47,208
- You're like Abdallah!
- We both love life!

106
00:12:13,175 --> 00:12:15,086
Don't ... l'm scared

107
00:12:15,455 --> 00:12:18,413
No. We want each other

108
00:12:18,615 --> 00:12:19,445
lt's simple

109
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,969
Get dressed.
Help me to stay chaste

110
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:31,610
That's ridiculous

111
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,331
l'm hiding our relationship
from Manuela

112
00:12:37,175 --> 00:12:38,449
Lying to my own sister!

113
00:12:40,335 --> 00:12:41,245
Did you tell anyone?

114
00:12:44,895 --> 00:12:46,169
l want to tell the whole world!

115
00:12:47,215 --> 00:12:49,854
Abdallah loves Sarah.
He's wild about her

116
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,044
Too bad she doesn't ..

117
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:55,645
No, l love you too

118
00:12:56,255 --> 00:12:57,051
Terribly

119
00:12:57,895 --> 00:12:58,725
Mere words

120
00:12:59,815 --> 00:13:01,771
lf Manuela finds out,
she'll kill me

121
00:13:01,975 --> 00:13:04,330
- She trusts me
- And you're betraying her

122
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:07,131
lt's not my fault.
lt's the Devil

123
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:10,689
He's a naughty boy..
a dirty little rascal

124
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:17,889
Every time we meet, l feel

125
00:13:18,095 --> 00:13:19,289
it's going to be the last

126
00:13:20,335 --> 00:13:24,408
The son of the Caliph
and a poor gypsy girl..

127
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:33,850
You may think l'm strange

128
00:13:34,415 --> 00:13:35,689
but that's just the way l am

129
00:13:48,135 --> 00:13:48,885
Soad!

130
00:14:01,295 --> 00:14:02,284
At your service

131
00:14:24,735 --> 00:14:26,248
They're staring at Abdallah

132
00:14:27,015 --> 00:14:29,165
When you're a Caliph's son,
people stare

133
00:14:31,615 --> 00:14:34,812
You're worried sick,
as if he were your own son

134
00:14:36,255 --> 00:14:39,372
l'd take a son like him
any day, faults and all!

135
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,128
He's sulking

136
00:14:41,535 --> 00:14:43,730
He won't speak to anyone

137
00:14:46,415 --> 00:14:48,929
Get him to dance.
He's dying to...

138
00:14:49,935 --> 00:14:51,163
The son of the Caliph?

139
00:14:51,855 --> 00:14:53,846
You're all out of your minds!

140
00:15:00,135 --> 00:15:02,171
He's had too much to drink

141
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,373
Quiet, please!

142
00:15:05,575 --> 00:15:06,564
l have a poem

143
00:15:08,255 --> 00:15:11,645
Loving you is a slow death.
My heart grieves

144
00:15:13,055 --> 00:15:16,286
And when my torment
becomes unbearable,

145
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:21,246
l invoke my woeful heart
and shout:

146
00:15:22,775 --> 00:15:26,085
"Why pine away for someone
who ignores you?

147
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:30,928
"Why care for so uncaring
a creature?

148
00:15:31,695 --> 00:15:34,687
"You, prisoner of pride
and vanity"

149
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,446
Such depth in so few words

150
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:39,083
lt's by Abu Nawas

151
00:15:40,535 --> 00:15:41,411
lt's amazing!

152
00:15:42,135 --> 00:15:44,046
You're so young

153
00:15:44,535 --> 00:15:46,093
and already a genius!

154
00:15:49,055 --> 00:15:50,329
Stay with us a while

155
00:15:50,895 --> 00:15:52,965
Share your learning with us

156
00:15:53,815 --> 00:15:56,488
What does "prisoner of pride"
mean?

157
00:15:59,735 --> 00:16:03,694
lt's sort of what happens
when your heart is sort of...

158
00:16:03,935 --> 00:16:06,733
lt comes from deep inside.
Sort of

159
00:16:07,295 --> 00:16:08,045
l'm overwhelmed

160
00:16:10,255 --> 00:16:12,132
l'll never attain
your level of insight

161
00:16:12,935 --> 00:16:14,573
Only a true thinker

162
00:16:15,095 --> 00:16:16,892
can appreciate such verse

163
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,050
You're a born poet

164
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,487
Every word you say is like...

165
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:23,525
A pearl!

166
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:24,890
A string of pearls!

167
00:16:25,415 --> 00:16:27,645
A Caliph's son mixing with
commoners!

168
00:16:28,935 --> 00:16:32,086
You're modesty itself!
People like you are rare

169
00:16:33,095 --> 00:16:34,653
God keep you for your people

170
00:16:36,535 --> 00:16:38,810
lf only you could spend
all night with us..

171
00:16:46,855 --> 00:16:48,288
The night is still young

172
00:16:51,175 --> 00:16:52,290
We can wait

173
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:28,251
#Hear me, lovers of life

174
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:41,811
#Hearts are ablaze

175
00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:46,014
#in the bonfire of love

176
00:17:48,015 --> 00:17:50,006
#lf the moon hid itself,

177
00:17:50,255 --> 00:17:52,723
#a thousand other moons

178
00:17:52,935 --> 00:17:56,007
#would light up the night

179
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,652
#They'd open the way

180
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,764
#for a thousand paths
to the impossible

181
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:27,845
#Even if you're late,
rosy sunrise,

182
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:32,134
#source of life,
we know you'll come back

183
00:18:55,215 --> 00:19:00,243
#You'll dazzle our eyes and
brighten our souls,

184
00:19:00,815 --> 00:19:03,852
#and you'll make us
masters of our destiny

185
00:19:04,135 --> 00:19:06,524
#We'll dance as we please

186
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:11,408
#And our dreams will dance
deep in our hearts

187
00:19:12,335 --> 00:19:13,085
#Jezebel!

188
00:19:13,295 --> 00:19:16,332
#We defy life with song

189
00:19:17,015 --> 00:19:18,573
#We defy life with song

190
00:19:26,455 --> 00:19:28,286
#Our hearts keep the beat

191
00:19:30,055 --> 00:19:31,807
#Our voices sing the tune

192
00:19:33,735 --> 00:19:34,645
#Our feet

193
00:19:35,015 --> 00:19:36,812
#stomp to the rhythm

194
00:19:46,495 --> 00:19:48,611
#Make haste

195
00:19:48,895 --> 00:19:52,729
#The road we must travel
is long

196
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:02,403
#and we have no other

197
00:20:04,695 --> 00:20:09,450
#Every step we take
is a burning torch

198
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:13,085
#guiding us on our way

199
00:20:15,735 --> 00:20:19,091
#We will not go astray

200
00:20:26,135 --> 00:20:29,252
#Dawn comes, lighting our way

201
00:20:29,455 --> 00:20:31,810
#to a shimmering day

202
00:20:32,135 --> 00:20:34,251
#Dawn comes, lighting our way

203
00:20:34,815 --> 00:20:36,885
#to a shimmering day

204
00:20:37,295 --> 00:20:38,489
#And if attacked,

205
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,208
#our dreams fight back

206
00:20:40,495 --> 00:20:41,484
#Resist! Fight!

207
00:20:42,535 --> 00:20:43,251
#And vanquish!

208
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,969
#We must remain
masters of our destiny

209
00:20:54,055 --> 00:20:56,046
- Let's go
- Not without him

210
00:20:56,615 --> 00:20:58,287
The Caliph's son?

211
00:20:58,575 --> 00:21:00,406
l have orders

212
00:21:00,695 --> 00:21:03,004
They said: "Don't come back
without him"

213
00:21:03,335 --> 00:21:04,893
- He'll slip away
- You think so?

214
00:21:05,655 --> 00:21:06,485
Here he comes

215
00:21:11,135 --> 00:21:11,851
Poet!

216
00:21:13,415 --> 00:21:15,610
- Will you join us?
- Why not?

217
00:21:17,935 --> 00:21:19,254
You won't be disappointed

218
00:21:43,975 --> 00:21:45,328
Say you're sorry! Say it!

219
00:21:47,455 --> 00:21:49,173
How can l?
You're gagging me!

220
00:21:51,055 --> 00:21:53,125
Hearts are ablaze

221
00:21:54,535 --> 00:21:56,207
Let's go pray

222
00:21:56,935 --> 00:22:00,564
so God will forgive us
for last night's excesses

223
00:22:01,095 --> 00:22:01,971
What excesses?

224
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:05,410
Dancing? l love dancing

225
00:22:05,815 --> 00:22:07,885
Of course. Dancing is wonderful

226
00:22:09,775 --> 00:22:11,094
You sway your head

227
00:22:11,335 --> 00:22:12,848
invoking the name of the Lord

228
00:22:13,815 --> 00:22:15,771
Your soul follows the rhythm

229
00:22:31,255 --> 00:22:36,090
#O God, you command us and
condemn us to silence

230
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:41,533
#Let us be content with
whatever you bestow on us

231
00:22:43,175 --> 00:22:44,733
#He who joins us

232
00:22:45,015 --> 00:22:48,291
#will attain bliss and
obtain redemption

233
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:50,454
#He who spurns us

234
00:22:50,815 --> 00:22:53,454
#will be forever damned

235
00:22:54,935 --> 00:22:57,324
#Obeying our Emir

236
00:22:57,535 --> 00:22:59,287
#is our supreme desire

237
00:23:00,775 --> 00:23:02,447
#Obeying our Emir

238
00:23:02,775 --> 00:23:03,969
#is our supreme desire

239
00:23:05,815 --> 00:23:06,804
Bless us!

240
00:23:07,295 --> 00:23:10,128
Emir, bless us!

241
00:23:35,135 --> 00:23:36,204
ls anything wrong?

242
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,564
No, l'm fine

243
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:44,772
A lazy fool learns two verses
of the Koran and passes himself off

244
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:48,731
as a purveyor of divine truth.
ls this man pious?

245
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:53,526
A true understanding of
these texts

246
00:23:55,015 --> 00:23:59,088
requires years of reflection,
research and labor

247
00:24:00,775 --> 00:24:03,573
lf we believe these
self-proclaimed geniuses,

248
00:24:04,015 --> 00:24:05,494
we disregard this Koranic verse:

249
00:24:06,615 --> 00:24:08,014
"ln the name of Allah
the Merciful

250
00:24:08,415 --> 00:24:12,454
"The ignorant man, whose vain words
lead astray from the way of God

251
00:24:12,775 --> 00:24:16,529
"and take it in mockery will be met
by a humbling chastisement

252
00:24:16,735 --> 00:24:18,009
"True is the word of
Almighty God"

253
00:24:19,935 --> 00:24:23,405
No one can claim to know
the whole truth

254
00:24:24,055 --> 00:24:26,285
Not even Caliph Mansur?

255
00:24:26,855 --> 00:24:30,689
The lmam Malek said,
pointing to the Prophet's tomb:

256
00:24:31,415 --> 00:24:35,044
"Every man can be questioned
except for him who lies here"

257
00:24:36,535 --> 00:24:37,968
The lmam El-Chafei said:

258
00:24:38,415 --> 00:24:40,645
"A true opinion can seem false

259
00:24:40,895 --> 00:24:42,692
and a false opinion, true"

260
00:24:46,455 --> 00:24:48,650
Averroes outsmarted him

261
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:50,208
Borhan is inept

262
00:24:50,815 --> 00:24:51,691
Be patient

263
00:24:52,455 --> 00:24:55,049
Borhan is craftier than you think.
You'll see

264
00:24:55,415 --> 00:24:58,646
The Koran is clear. Are you
inciting us to doubt it?

265
00:25:00,135 --> 00:25:02,251
The Prophet said:

266
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:06,845
"lf your quest leads to truth,
you will have two parts

267
00:25:07,135 --> 00:25:10,127
"lf it leads to error, one part.
All quests are rewarded"

268
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:12,568
"Lord, increase me in knowledge"

269
00:25:12,775 --> 00:25:14,447
Knowledge? What about faith?

270
00:25:15,415 --> 00:25:16,530
Are you contesting God?

271
00:25:17,175 --> 00:25:18,210
He outsmarted him again!

272
00:25:18,815 --> 00:25:22,490
Averroes said: "Revelation can be
interpreted only by study"

273
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:24,727
We should have answered:

274
00:25:25,535 --> 00:25:27,253
"The Text allows no interpretation"

275
00:25:28,615 --> 00:25:30,845
lf you're so clever,
answer him yourself

276
00:25:31,535 --> 00:25:33,287
and get your own flock
of admirers

277
00:25:34,455 --> 00:25:36,332
We have to silence Averroes

278
00:25:37,055 --> 00:25:41,014
We must coerce the Caliph
into forbidding him to teach

279
00:25:42,055 --> 00:25:43,204
There's no use bickering

280
00:25:44,695 --> 00:25:46,765
We'll take the necessary
measures

281
00:25:47,935 --> 00:25:50,130
"Be patient as the Messengers
possessed of constancy"

282
00:25:51,455 --> 00:25:53,173
They leave the mosque
one by one,

283
00:25:53,895 --> 00:25:56,011
pretending your lesson
bores them

284
00:25:56,295 --> 00:25:59,651
lt's surely a ruse plotted by
an invidious mind

285
00:26:01,735 --> 00:26:03,248
l should "plot" a little song
for them

286
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:05,413
Careful. Your song could
cost you your life

287
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:28,413
What happened?

288
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,334
Not now

289
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:33,285
Everyone, out!

290
00:27:58,975 --> 00:28:02,092
A pretty girl like you
taking care of the laundry

291
00:28:02,935 --> 00:28:03,890
And not of you?

292
00:28:04,815 --> 00:28:07,283
l'm ready and willing
to help you discover

293
00:28:07,535 --> 00:28:09,366
the pleasures of this world

294
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,093
The nerve of you!

295
00:28:12,615 --> 00:28:16,688
Son of a Caliph or not,
if you keep at it, l'll slap you!

296
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,931
l'll throw you in jail
and tickle you to death

297
00:28:20,135 --> 00:28:20,806
Brute!

298
00:28:32,735 --> 00:28:34,691
He'll be on his feet
in a week or so

299
00:28:35,615 --> 00:28:37,492
For the time being,
he needs to rest

300
00:28:44,695 --> 00:28:45,650
Good going, Nasser

301
00:28:46,495 --> 00:28:48,451
Removing the knife
would have killed him

302
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:50,774
Did you see who attacked him?

303
00:28:51,335 --> 00:28:54,964
He was about twenty.. with
a crazed look in his eyes

304
00:28:55,215 --> 00:28:57,285
- Why didn't you catch him?
- And leave Marwan?

305
00:28:57,855 --> 00:28:58,446
Smart thinking!

306
00:28:59,055 --> 00:29:02,172
My horse kicked one of them
in the face

307
00:29:02,815 --> 00:29:04,806
l'd recognize the hoof-print

308
00:29:05,815 --> 00:29:08,568
Do something or every
philosopher will perish

309
00:29:08,775 --> 00:29:09,810
Marwan, a philosopher?

310
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:11,971
His songs belittle my father

311
00:29:12,255 --> 00:29:16,168
lt's your father's fault.
He's giving the fanatics free rein

312
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:19,650
lf l were in charge,
l'd show you!

313
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,052
l can just see you
on the throne

314
00:29:25,615 --> 00:29:27,253
Over there.
Get off my "throne"

315
00:29:27,775 --> 00:29:29,128
Marwan!

316
00:29:33,895 --> 00:29:34,850
Shut the gates

317
00:29:56,535 --> 00:29:59,049
l'm looking after my husband
now! Understand?

318
00:30:00,895 --> 00:30:05,491
The security of the Almohad dynasty
has never been so threatened

319
00:30:06,335 --> 00:30:08,803
Where have you been,
High Judge Averroes?

320
00:30:09,615 --> 00:30:12,971
And you, governor of Cordoba?
And you, the crown prince?

321
00:30:13,535 --> 00:30:14,650
The country is foundering

322
00:30:15,495 --> 00:30:18,726
After all we've done,
who would dare protest?

323
00:30:19,295 --> 00:30:21,092
People are exploiting religion

324
00:30:21,415 --> 00:30:23,087
and you're letting them

325
00:30:23,535 --> 00:30:26,129
They're the only ones we hear
in the mosques

326
00:30:26,695 --> 00:30:28,970
You'd be heard if you were
as eloquent as these

327
00:30:29,975 --> 00:30:30,691
men of faith

328
00:30:31,615 --> 00:30:33,446
Merchants of faith,
if you ask me

329
00:30:34,095 --> 00:30:35,574
Whether they rant on
about Arab victories

330
00:30:35,775 --> 00:30:39,973
or about religion, they're only
defending their interests

331
00:30:40,615 --> 00:30:44,005
Stop philosophizing.
We're talking about one man

332
00:30:44,215 --> 00:30:45,250
- lt's not...
- Nasser!

333
00:30:45,935 --> 00:30:48,927
Find the assailant
and have him executed

334
00:30:49,255 --> 00:30:52,884
lt's not a man, but a movement
gnawing away at your authority

335
00:30:53,415 --> 00:30:57,966
No movement in the world
can shake my throne

336
00:30:58,375 --> 00:31:01,048
These barbarians are
jeopardizing our culture

337
00:31:01,255 --> 00:31:04,247
What are you waiting for?
Go execute my sentence

338
00:31:11,775 --> 00:31:13,447
Have the assailant interrogated

339
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:16,610
He may tell us what's ailing
our country

340
00:31:17,095 --> 00:31:19,609
The country isn't ailing.
lt's in fine shape

341
00:31:19,815 --> 00:31:20,645
The danger is real

342
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:24,572
They're a menace to the whole realm,
not just Andalusia

343
00:31:25,095 --> 00:31:26,289
They've indoctrinated..

344
00:31:26,495 --> 00:31:27,814
thousands of young people

345
00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:29,044
By magic?

346
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:33,852
l think the assailant was
manipulated by conspirators

347
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:36,331
Let the law decide

348
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:40,332
Show in the commander
of the cavalry

349
00:31:45,575 --> 00:31:46,724
ln my opinion..

350
00:31:47,495 --> 00:31:49,053
You have opinions now?

351
00:31:52,095 --> 00:31:54,734
Opinions, positions..

352
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:58,248
Convictions, too.
A lot more than you think

353
00:31:58,455 --> 00:32:00,525
Why not take my throne
from me?

354
00:32:00,935 --> 00:32:03,369
Turn my people into a dance
troupe!

355
00:32:05,135 --> 00:32:07,968
lf my ideas bore you,
l'll go elsewhere

356
00:32:08,295 --> 00:32:10,934
Find a mosque and
speak your heart out!

357
00:32:11,135 --> 00:32:13,365
Why not? l have a mouth

358
00:32:14,735 --> 00:32:17,295
You do. lt's a brain
you don't have

359
00:32:17,975 --> 00:32:18,885
God help you

360
00:32:19,775 --> 00:32:21,527
- What?
- God bless you

361
00:32:22,535 --> 00:32:23,968
High Judge!

362
00:32:25,015 --> 00:32:26,130
Does he deserve to die?

363
00:32:27,015 --> 00:32:29,324
The Caliph's moods
have replaced our laws

364
00:32:29,975 --> 00:32:32,728
Go kill the boy.
Obey your father's orders!

365
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:35,445
His Highness demands blind
allegiance

366
00:32:35,815 --> 00:32:37,726
- Maybe l should...
- You decide

367
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:40,808
lf l were you,
l'd think it over

368
00:32:42,535 --> 00:32:43,251
Think hard

369
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:25,092
This is only the beginning!

370
00:33:25,415 --> 00:33:26,325
My son!

371
00:33:26,775 --> 00:33:27,685
My child!

372
00:33:33,455 --> 00:33:36,413
Why arrest him?
Anyone could have done it!

373
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:38,773
Where are you taking him?

374
00:33:43,695 --> 00:33:46,050
Did you attack Marwan
because of his poems?

375
00:33:46,575 --> 00:33:48,452
- l've never read them
- Why then?

376
00:33:48,975 --> 00:33:51,443
lf God lets me live,
l'll stab him again

377
00:33:52,255 --> 00:33:53,324
He's the enemy of God

378
00:33:53,855 --> 00:33:55,447
- You didn't dress your wound
- lt's a sin

379
00:33:57,615 --> 00:34:00,573
Who told you Marwan is
an enemy of God?

380
00:34:00,855 --> 00:34:02,049
Good Muslims don't sing

381
00:34:07,975 --> 00:34:08,964
He's stark-raving mad

382
00:34:09,415 --> 00:34:12,054
He repeats like a parrot
without understanding

383
00:34:12,655 --> 00:34:16,409
How do they kill all feelings
in these boys

384
00:34:16,775 --> 00:34:19,050
and turn them into criminals?

385
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:22,967
He has a brother who
escaped from the sect

386
00:34:23,655 --> 00:34:24,974
He tried to kill him too

387
00:34:29,095 --> 00:34:31,609
l'd like to meet the brother

388
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:34,205
l'll get him

389
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:36,890
No.. let's go to his house

390
00:34:37,695 --> 00:34:41,654
They made my head spin with
flattery. l believed them

391
00:34:42,855 --> 00:34:44,971
"You're so smart.. so unique..

392
00:34:45,575 --> 00:34:49,124
"Every word you speak is a pearl.
Show us the way..

393
00:34:49,575 --> 00:34:52,533
"Let's go spend a few days
in the desert

394
00:34:53,495 --> 00:34:56,885
"lf we meditate together,
we'll be as one

395
00:34:57,815 --> 00:34:59,407
"Nothing will ever tear us apart"

396
00:35:01,495 --> 00:35:03,008
Then they began to wear us down

397
00:35:06,175 --> 00:35:10,771
Praying until dawn,
marching through the desert..

398
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:12,406
endlessly..

399
00:35:12,615 --> 00:35:13,730
in the burning sun

400
00:35:15,175 --> 00:35:17,131
Not knowing where we were
going, or why..

401
00:35:18,055 --> 00:35:19,647
Our feet burnt by the sand

402
00:35:20,295 --> 00:35:22,490
"lt purifies the soul
and strengthens the will"

403
00:35:23,615 --> 00:35:25,492
ln fact, it shattered our wills

404
00:35:27,215 --> 00:35:30,332
We became slaves to the
Emir's will

405
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:35,369
l was instructed to tell people

406
00:35:37,175 --> 00:35:38,813
that they had become impious,

407
00:35:39,655 --> 00:35:41,850
that they had to regain
the path to Truth

408
00:36:13,655 --> 00:36:17,364
Follow my advice and
you'll see the way

409
00:36:17,895 --> 00:36:20,363
Just like our Emir,
who sees all,

410
00:36:21,695 --> 00:36:25,165
past, present and future

411
00:36:26,615 --> 00:36:28,571
One day, he saw me steal
from my mother

412
00:36:29,135 --> 00:36:30,693
and stick my finger in her eye

413
00:36:30,895 --> 00:36:32,567
He shouted: "You shall deliver
the world

414
00:36:32,775 --> 00:36:33,685
from the enemies of God"

415
00:36:34,615 --> 00:36:37,527
He guides my weapon

416
00:36:38,535 --> 00:36:40,253
Every throat l cut

417
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,572
takes me one step closer
to Paradise

418
00:36:51,015 --> 00:36:51,652
Yesterday

419
00:36:54,055 --> 00:36:56,011
he had a vision:
l was dressed in white,

420
00:36:58,375 --> 00:37:00,013
on my way to Paradise

421
00:37:01,895 --> 00:37:05,205
Everything l'd ever longed for

422
00:37:05,495 --> 00:37:06,723
was laid out before me

423
00:37:10,415 --> 00:37:11,245
That can only mean

424
00:37:13,975 --> 00:37:15,374
that l'm very close

425
00:37:18,215 --> 00:37:19,694
to being delivered

426
00:37:22,255 --> 00:37:23,529
How about me?

427
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:25,574
We chose you, didn't we?

428
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:27,928
l shouldn't tell you this

429
00:37:31,695 --> 00:37:35,244
The Emir had a vision of you
ruling over Andalusia

430
00:37:35,815 --> 00:37:37,533
with all of us at your feet

431
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,649
We are your true family

432
00:37:47,215 --> 00:37:49,968
Flee those who are in the
clutches of the Devil

433
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:54,333
Open your heart and tell me
all about yourself

434
00:37:56,935 --> 00:37:57,572
All right?

435
00:38:01,415 --> 00:38:02,325
All right

436
00:38:02,855 --> 00:38:03,810
What does your son do?

437
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:08,333
Nothing at all! Everyone says
he's a good-for-nothing!

438
00:38:08,535 --> 00:38:09,934
He should find a job!

439
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:13,049
You find him one!
You know lots of people

440
00:38:13,655 --> 00:38:15,213
You're an important man

441
00:38:15,855 --> 00:38:17,573
What can he do?

442
00:38:18,215 --> 00:38:21,127
He never liked studying.
He likes giving orders

443
00:38:21,535 --> 00:38:22,809
Make a soldier out of him!

444
00:38:23,295 --> 00:38:24,853
Someone told him:
"Learn a few verses

445
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:28,047
and you can order people
around"

446
00:38:28,655 --> 00:38:31,169
Who wants to keep on being
a good-for-nothing?

447
00:38:33,455 --> 00:38:35,366
Does murder make you
good for something?

448
00:38:36,175 --> 00:38:38,769
- Answer me
- Stop harassing him!

449
00:38:38,975 --> 00:38:40,454
Has he lost his tongue?

450
00:38:40,655 --> 00:38:43,965
He's been silent for a month.
When he does talk, he says:

451
00:38:44,215 --> 00:38:47,287
"l'll make you rich,
you and all the neighbors!"

452
00:38:47,535 --> 00:38:50,766
Then he goes back to bed
and he sleeps. And sleeps!

453
00:38:56,055 --> 00:38:57,204
Once thoroughly exhausted,

454
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:59,571
you're ready to obey any orders.
lf they say

455
00:39:00,055 --> 00:39:03,286
"Kill your father,"
you do it

456
00:39:04,095 --> 00:39:07,212
And if you get caught,
they're the first to turn on you

457
00:39:08,815 --> 00:39:10,214
What do you think, Sheik Riad?

458
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:14,564
Can someone regain his dignity
by stabbing a poet?

459
00:39:15,775 --> 00:39:18,005
The only right way
is the way of the Lord

460
00:39:18,335 --> 00:39:19,973
Had Marwan lost his way?

461
00:39:21,055 --> 00:39:23,728
Marwan is old enough to know
right from wrong

462
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,526
"Evil is self-evident"

463
00:39:27,455 --> 00:39:30,413
Can these three children
tell good from evil?

464
00:39:31,295 --> 00:39:33,286
lt's up to the High Judge
to decide

465
00:39:35,295 --> 00:39:38,412
God says: "He who smites
shall be smitten"

466
00:39:40,935 --> 00:39:43,972
lf they are executed,
they'll say they're martyrs

467
00:39:44,335 --> 00:39:45,654
on the way to Paradise

468
00:39:46,295 --> 00:39:49,093
lt's better that they enjoy
their lives on earth!

469
00:39:49,695 --> 00:39:51,811
"For this world,
act as if you were eternal,

470
00:39:52,215 --> 00:39:54,285
for the next, as if you must
die tomorrow"

471
00:39:54,775 --> 00:39:55,651
He's a child!

472
00:39:56,295 --> 00:39:58,365
What does he know

473
00:39:58,735 --> 00:40:00,851
about death and eternity?

474
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:03,373
Quiet! Listen to the judgement

475
00:40:18,495 --> 00:40:22,329
Revelation is destined only to
those endowed with Reason

476
00:40:22,735 --> 00:40:23,690
That is, mankind

477
00:40:24,695 --> 00:40:26,811
Divine law combines
Revelation and Reason

478
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:32,168
lt consists in determining
causes and effects,

479
00:40:32,815 --> 00:40:34,009
mean and ends

480
00:40:35,255 --> 00:40:39,043
Revelation encompasses Reason
and Reason encompasses Revelation

481
00:40:40,255 --> 00:40:42,769
Certain children confuse
religion and ignorance

482
00:40:43,335 --> 00:40:45,849
Certain adults turn ignorance
into a religion

483
00:40:47,615 --> 00:40:51,085
Our young defendants
were led into perdition

484
00:40:52,335 --> 00:40:55,805
Without realizing it,
they were forced astray

485
00:40:56,815 --> 00:40:59,648
ln its great equity,
lslam refuses

486
00:41:00,575 --> 00:41:02,088
to condemn an unsound mind

487
00:41:02,935 --> 00:41:05,733
The High Court abstains
from capital punishment

488
00:41:06,135 --> 00:41:10,492
and sentences the accused
to five years in prison

489
00:41:11,695 --> 00:41:14,687
"God shall not be questioned,
but they shall be questioned"

490
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:17,694
He deserved to die

491
00:41:18,135 --> 00:41:20,012
ls our house so terrible?

492
00:41:20,415 --> 00:41:22,610
There's plenty to eat and drink

493
00:41:23,935 --> 00:41:25,846
We all help each other

494
00:41:26,135 --> 00:41:30,925
But no. He wants everyone
to obey him and call him "Emir"

495
00:41:31,575 --> 00:41:33,964
My son, the frog,
wants to be a prince

496
00:41:35,175 --> 00:41:37,211
What's the joy in giving orders?

497
00:41:46,575 --> 00:41:50,090
The judge won't change his mind,
will he?

498
00:41:51,415 --> 00:41:53,610
l trust Averroes

499
00:41:54,255 --> 00:41:59,887
From your mouth to God's ears!
Long live Averroes!

500
00:42:00,215 --> 00:42:02,126
May God illuminate your way
with His heavenly light!

501
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:07,252
You're madmen talking about reason!

502
00:42:07,815 --> 00:42:10,409
What more do you want?
The boys confessed

503
00:42:13,215 --> 00:42:15,524
You flouted my authority
by sparing him

504
00:42:16,615 --> 00:42:18,731
The country is going to the dogs!

505
00:42:19,335 --> 00:42:21,087
Didn't l order him to be killed?

506
00:42:21,575 --> 00:42:24,408
Listen to me, brother.
The boy is only eighteen

507
00:42:24,615 --> 00:42:27,812
Fate saved Marwan
by averting his knife

508
00:42:28,135 --> 00:42:29,250
Marwan has forgiven him

509
00:42:29,695 --> 00:42:30,366
Marwan?

510
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:35,447
Since when is Marwan a judge?

511
00:42:35,935 --> 00:42:36,651
How can l protect you?

512
00:42:37,775 --> 00:42:39,970
They weren't responsible for
their acts

513
00:42:41,055 --> 00:42:44,809
Sheik Riad says otherwise.
So does the Council of Theologians

514
00:42:45,575 --> 00:42:49,124
l decide what's in the
country's interest

515
00:42:49,335 --> 00:42:50,848
Not Sheik Riad. Not you. Me

516
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:53,605
You refuse all advice?

517
00:42:54,815 --> 00:42:56,248
The Council agrees with me

518
00:42:56,815 --> 00:43:00,251
They're very unhappy
with your verdict

519
00:43:00,455 --> 00:43:01,490
The Sheik is scheming..

520
00:43:01,935 --> 00:43:03,573
The same old hallucinations

521
00:43:04,855 --> 00:43:05,605
Maybe

522
00:43:08,175 --> 00:43:11,724
As long as l'm Judge,
my conscience will guide me

523
00:43:11,975 --> 00:43:13,328
Even if l lose face?

524
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:16,891
Brother, your dignity is
not in question

525
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:20,087
You've always been merciful.
Think of the lives at stake

526
00:43:20,535 --> 00:43:23,129
l won't go back on my word

527
00:43:23,895 --> 00:43:27,410
This time, tragedy struck
the sons of your citizens

528
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:30,448
Next time, it may strike
your own sons

529
00:43:31,655 --> 00:43:33,964
- l can protect them
- Lucky for them

530
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:42,650
But don't forget: Your citizens
are your sons too

531
00:43:53,575 --> 00:43:55,406
- Where is Saad?
- The brother?

532
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,128
l found him a job

533
00:43:58,735 --> 00:44:01,454
lf you can't hide him, l will

534
00:44:05,695 --> 00:44:06,889
How beautiful!

535
00:44:09,495 --> 00:44:10,769
Our city must be

536
00:44:14,335 --> 00:44:16,803
the envy of the whole world

537
00:44:25,895 --> 00:44:30,093
Why did that idiot Emir of yours
send Borhan to my house?

538
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:33,809
One more blunder and l'll cut off
his funding

539
00:44:35,335 --> 00:44:36,768
Better yet.. his head

540
00:44:37,255 --> 00:44:39,769
- l have a request
- l paid you

541
00:44:40,495 --> 00:44:43,373
Three " suicides" .
l've had to shut some mouths

542
00:44:48,175 --> 00:44:51,292
l have a favor to ask.
l can be of use to you

543
00:44:52,695 --> 00:44:53,525
Speak

544
00:44:55,135 --> 00:44:58,571
l want to become a judge again
and regain my lost honor

545
00:44:58,815 --> 00:45:00,692
Averroes branded me a common thief

546
00:45:01,175 --> 00:45:01,891
You were stupid

547
00:45:03,135 --> 00:45:06,491
He caught you accepting bribes.
He's alert

548
00:45:07,215 --> 00:45:08,534
l'm not after his position

549
00:45:09,095 --> 00:45:11,006
l just want to be a judge again

550
00:45:12,015 --> 00:45:13,448
You could take his place

551
00:45:14,855 --> 00:45:16,254
You have a pretty face

552
00:45:19,455 --> 00:45:22,686
Your beard is reason enough
for me to give you his job

553
00:45:23,415 --> 00:45:25,246
By resigning,
you accuse my father

554
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,164
He's your best friend

555
00:45:29,575 --> 00:45:33,454
You refuse him the benefit of
the doubt you give to criminals

556
00:45:33,735 --> 00:45:36,613
How can your father ignore
what's going on?

557
00:45:37,215 --> 00:45:39,206
Those boys were bound
hand and foot

558
00:45:39,495 --> 00:45:42,134
and hanged in nooses
made of their clothes

559
00:45:42,335 --> 00:45:44,769
lt's their custom!

560
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:46,684
When they're caught,
they commit suicide!

561
00:45:47,175 --> 00:45:49,564
No, they were "suicided"
so they can't talk!

562
00:45:50,215 --> 00:45:51,011
The sects are all over

563
00:45:51,655 --> 00:45:53,088
Not in my courts!

564
00:45:53,575 --> 00:45:55,008
That would be the death
of Andalusia

565
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,767
The Caliph is not above the law

566
00:45:58,055 --> 00:45:59,568
He too is accountable
for his acts

567
00:46:01,455 --> 00:46:04,288
Decadence is gnawing away
at kingdoms everywhere

568
00:46:04,975 --> 00:46:09,287
Lies and corruption have replaced
justice and morality

569
00:46:11,295 --> 00:46:13,604
There's more at stake
than a few dead boys

570
00:46:14,095 --> 00:46:17,724
Our culture, whose source
is lslam, is threatened

571
00:46:17,935 --> 00:46:19,926
My father is protecting it!

572
00:46:20,215 --> 00:46:22,092
He built you a library!

573
00:46:22,295 --> 00:46:23,774
He had you analyze Aristotle!

574
00:46:23,975 --> 00:46:26,489
You wrote your commentaries
thanks to him!

575
00:46:26,695 --> 00:46:28,925
And thanks to him, my mother
had me! Say it!

576
00:46:32,015 --> 00:46:33,209
Here's my resignation

577
00:46:36,015 --> 00:46:37,494
You're not through with me yet

578
00:46:42,215 --> 00:46:47,414
l knew it. Averroes would never
abandon us

579
00:46:47,615 --> 00:46:49,094
and leave Sheik Riad
to do as he pleases

580
00:46:49,295 --> 00:46:51,855
He expected a death sentence
from you

581
00:46:52,055 --> 00:46:53,488
lt was in his interest

582
00:46:54,135 --> 00:46:55,966
And you outfoxed him

583
00:46:56,295 --> 00:46:59,173
- Three boys were killed!
- Every cloud has a silver lining

584
00:46:59,735 --> 00:47:00,611
What do you mean?

585
00:47:01,495 --> 00:47:04,532
Forget my father.
Let's keep an eye on Sheik Riad

586
00:47:10,815 --> 00:47:11,611
Get up

587
00:47:13,495 --> 00:47:15,087
Get up and pray

588
00:47:19,135 --> 00:47:20,045
There's the east

589
00:47:22,855 --> 00:47:23,571
Get up!

590
00:47:26,695 --> 00:47:28,128
Die, but die pure

591
00:47:41,615 --> 00:47:43,890
Marwan asked you here
because he loves you

592
00:47:44,335 --> 00:47:46,895
He's been waiting for you
all week

593
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,570
Why didn't you come?

594
00:47:48,775 --> 00:47:50,413
My only duty is to avoid
the Demon

595
00:47:50,975 --> 00:47:53,284
Who is the Demon? Me?
Marwan?

596
00:47:53,615 --> 00:47:54,730
Or his assailant?

597
00:47:54,935 --> 00:47:57,893
lf you were pure,
you'd know who attacked him

598
00:47:58,495 --> 00:48:01,931
Thank God, there are serene people
who see clearly

599
00:48:02,375 --> 00:48:03,774
What do these geniuses say?

600
00:48:04,975 --> 00:48:06,886
The true culprit is in the palace

601
00:48:08,895 --> 00:48:12,570
Your father? The Caliph doesn't
need mercenaries

602
00:48:13,295 --> 00:48:15,013
Are you crazy? Your father!

603
00:48:15,335 --> 00:48:17,087
"Darkness swallows up stray souls"

604
00:48:17,535 --> 00:48:18,365
Your father?

605
00:48:18,575 --> 00:48:20,805
" Abandon all Evil
and you shall be saved"

606
00:48:21,255 --> 00:48:22,131
God keep you

607
00:48:26,655 --> 00:48:27,405
Abdallah!

608
00:48:28,055 --> 00:48:30,523
Manuela, you're the only person
l still love

609
00:48:30,895 --> 00:48:31,964
Don't make me hate you

610
00:48:34,015 --> 00:48:35,004
What's gotten into him?

611
00:48:42,415 --> 00:48:44,246
He's running away from me

612
00:48:45,735 --> 00:48:46,724
Because l'm pregnant

613
00:48:49,015 --> 00:48:50,084
With Abdallah's child?

614
00:48:51,815 --> 00:48:54,932
The Caliph's son? Woe betide us!

615
00:48:57,055 --> 00:48:58,568
Sarah's carrying Abdallah's child

616
00:49:01,255 --> 00:49:02,608
That explains his behavior

617
00:49:02,855 --> 00:49:06,404
When his father learns a gypsy
will inherit the throne

618
00:49:06,615 --> 00:49:07,934
he'll slit the baby's throat!

619
00:49:11,695 --> 00:49:16,450
lf he came back, then he loves you.
That's all that counts

620
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:19,728
He's crazy. She'd best forget him

621
00:49:39,295 --> 00:49:41,206
l'll never be able to forget him!

622
00:49:42,015 --> 00:49:45,087
Neither will l.
We're the ones to blame

623
00:49:45,375 --> 00:49:48,651
We brought them together.
lt's not Sarah's fault

624
00:49:49,535 --> 00:49:50,524
Or Abdallah's

625
00:49:50,735 --> 00:49:53,966
l'll raise the child myself.
No one will know a thing!

626
00:50:00,295 --> 00:50:01,569
Are you moving, Joseph?

627
00:50:02,575 --> 00:50:05,328
l'm looking for a safe hiding
place. You never know..

628
00:50:05,935 --> 00:50:06,924
This is his life's work

629
00:50:07,895 --> 00:50:11,012
The house of the High Judge
isn't safe enough?

630
00:50:11,695 --> 00:50:15,654
You must have a special place
where you keep your valuables

631
00:50:16,215 --> 00:50:20,094
You mean my jewels?
l've never had any!

632
00:50:20,495 --> 00:50:21,484
Averroes is poor?

633
00:50:21,855 --> 00:50:24,449
He spends everything
on his books and students

634
00:50:28,815 --> 00:50:30,533
Come here.
Put them in the cellar

635
00:50:30,975 --> 00:50:32,647
Put them behind the sacks
of flour

636
00:50:33,695 --> 00:50:34,730
Take this

637
00:51:05,615 --> 00:51:06,650
Aristotle!

638
00:51:09,455 --> 00:51:11,207
Even without gallows

639
00:51:11,615 --> 00:51:14,607
You're driving me crazy
with your gallows!

640
00:51:15,975 --> 00:51:20,207
One more word about criminals
and executioners

641
00:51:20,495 --> 00:51:22,611
and l'll send the lamb
next door!

642
00:51:22,815 --> 00:51:25,852
- l'll let you starve!
- Let's talk about happiness

643
00:51:26,615 --> 00:51:27,934
Come sit next to me

644
00:51:28,615 --> 00:51:31,573
Come here, my love

645
00:51:36,095 --> 00:51:37,164
What is happiness?

646
00:51:39,055 --> 00:51:41,933
At daybreak, after l prepare
your tea,

647
00:51:42,455 --> 00:51:46,084
l go back to bed and the rest
of the world can go to hell

648
00:51:47,935 --> 00:51:49,254
lt's pure bliss

649
00:51:50,375 --> 00:51:51,171
What else?

650
00:51:52,415 --> 00:51:56,408
When Salma was born, she didn't
even cry. l thought l'd die!

651
00:51:56,655 --> 00:52:01,888
Then she started gurgling.
l looked at her. She was so pretty

652
00:52:02,975 --> 00:52:04,010
Gorgeous!

653
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:11,163
Salma, here we are!
l've brought Marwan!

654
00:52:13,415 --> 00:52:14,131
lt's been ages!

655
00:52:14,735 --> 00:52:15,804
Marwan's back!

656
00:52:21,775 --> 00:52:25,370
l'm fine, thank God.
lt's good to see you all again!

657
00:52:29,975 --> 00:52:31,169
You're back on your feet

658
00:52:38,735 --> 00:52:41,374
Manuela is grateful
for all you've done

659
00:52:44,055 --> 00:52:45,329
How is my queen doing?

660
00:52:51,975 --> 00:52:54,887
Nasser, you behaved like
a true hero

661
00:53:14,135 --> 00:53:19,732
Sing your song to your
heart's content

662
00:53:21,935 --> 00:53:24,608
for we can still sing

663
00:53:28,295 --> 00:53:30,763
And we'll keep on singing

664
00:53:33,255 --> 00:53:39,046
day in, day out,
for the rest of our lives

665
00:53:48,295 --> 00:53:49,284
No, come back!

666
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:43,125
Come on

667
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,929
What a catastrophe!

668
00:54:46,175 --> 00:54:48,086
- Take shelter!
- All my books.. destroyed!

669
00:54:58,655 --> 00:55:01,852
All your books are here.
None are missing

670
00:55:03,375 --> 00:55:04,285
They're all here

671
00:55:08,495 --> 00:55:11,328
"Commentary on Aristotle"

672
00:55:12,535 --> 00:55:14,526
A little messy, but intact

673
00:55:30,655 --> 00:55:33,692
My "Aristotle" ..
l can't believe it

674
00:55:35,255 --> 00:55:36,608
You're the best!

675
00:55:36,815 --> 00:55:38,453
How did you guess?

676
00:55:40,575 --> 00:55:41,769
Son of a witch!

677
00:55:44,615 --> 00:55:46,685
All this for a bean-pole
who saves some books!

678
00:55:47,055 --> 00:55:50,047
l save his life and what do l get?
Nothing!

679
00:55:50,255 --> 00:55:51,244
A book is worth a hundred lives

680
00:55:51,935 --> 00:55:54,290
Maybe not for me..
but for Averroes

681
00:56:01,375 --> 00:56:04,845
- This is getting serious
- Maybe Joseph forgot a lamp

682
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:07,889
No, this is Sheik Riad's doing

683
00:56:09,335 --> 00:56:11,326
Before, he just wanted to
distract us

684
00:56:12,615 --> 00:56:15,413
Now he'll use arson and murder
to silence us

685
00:56:16,935 --> 00:56:18,254
How evil!

686
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:26,574
A pure man like you cannot imagine
that others can stood so low

687
00:56:26,975 --> 00:56:27,851
You're pure too

688
00:56:29,415 --> 00:56:31,565
Even l have a hard time
believing it

689
00:56:32,855 --> 00:56:35,210
Sheik Riad craves power
for power's sake

690
00:56:37,055 --> 00:56:40,252
lf my suspicions are founded,
he should hang six times

691
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:44,685
He's the richest man in the land.
What more could he want?

692
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:45,931
Power

693
00:56:46,615 --> 00:56:49,732
He'd do anything for it.
He's driven by hunger

694
00:56:50,295 --> 00:56:51,444
Does my father know?

695
00:56:52,255 --> 00:56:53,529
l sincerely hope so

696
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:58,685
Sheik Riad is loyal.
Don't be ridiculous

697
00:56:58,895 --> 00:57:01,011
He has always stood by my side

698
00:57:01,255 --> 00:57:03,246
You gave him a lot of land
in return

699
00:57:03,815 --> 00:57:05,407
Does he want all Andalusia?

700
00:57:05,815 --> 00:57:06,645
l need him

701
00:57:07,175 --> 00:57:10,087
People respect him.
Let me rule my country

702
00:57:10,295 --> 00:57:11,808
And get rid of Averroes?

703
00:57:14,655 --> 00:57:16,008
Sheik Riad, the man you accuse,

704
00:57:16,215 --> 00:57:19,252
opposes the fatwa
that the Council demands

705
00:57:19,455 --> 00:57:21,173
They want to burn
all of Averroes' books

706
00:57:22,055 --> 00:57:23,090
This one above all

707
00:57:24,975 --> 00:57:27,728
"The lncoherence of lncoherence"
l've read it

708
00:57:28,455 --> 00:57:30,286
You understand their dismay

709
00:57:30,615 --> 00:57:33,254
So that's why they set fire
to his library

710
00:57:34,215 --> 00:57:36,126
They all seem to agree
with Ghazali

711
00:57:36,695 --> 00:57:39,687
He's a great thinker
and Averroes says he's wrong

712
00:57:40,135 --> 00:57:41,250
What if Averroes is right?

713
00:57:42,215 --> 00:57:43,568
He's too sure of himself

714
00:57:44,575 --> 00:57:45,644
He lacks modesty

715
00:57:47,655 --> 00:57:49,725
He insists on calling me
"brother"

716
00:57:50,415 --> 00:57:51,609
Where did he get that from?

717
00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:53,484
Are we related now?

718
00:57:53,975 --> 00:57:56,728
l had no idea. Your uncle
is his latest dupe

719
00:57:57,735 --> 00:57:58,611
My uncle loves him

720
00:57:59,535 --> 00:58:01,207
That may be our downfall

721
00:58:02,135 --> 00:58:03,807
Do you realize
what a fatwa means?

722
00:58:04,095 --> 00:58:07,132
The annihilation of all of
Averroes' works

723
00:58:07,935 --> 00:58:09,129
As if he never existed

724
00:58:12,295 --> 00:58:13,091
What are you making?

725
00:58:14,335 --> 00:58:15,131
A basket

726
00:58:17,935 --> 00:58:19,607
So Sheik Riad's protecting me?

727
00:58:20,015 --> 00:58:21,004
From which fatwa?

728
00:58:21,895 --> 00:58:23,374
The one he recommended
to the Council

729
00:58:29,655 --> 00:58:31,293
- You knew about it?
- Of course

730
00:58:32,055 --> 00:58:33,773
And you didn't tell us?

731
00:58:34,855 --> 00:58:37,494
lt's a sword hanging over
our heads

732
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:40,209
- My father will intervene
- No, he won't

733
00:58:42,135 --> 00:58:43,932
This is all so sad

734
00:58:44,775 --> 00:58:46,288
The two of you were so close

735
00:58:46,935 --> 00:58:48,414
Sheik Riad has spoiled that now

736
00:58:51,215 --> 00:58:54,412
This is the logical consequence
of my acts

737
00:58:55,215 --> 00:58:57,171
l have to accept it

738
00:58:58,295 --> 00:59:00,251
This fatwa threatens
more than your books

739
00:59:03,335 --> 00:59:04,563
Your life is in danger

740
00:59:04,895 --> 00:59:07,045
We all have to die someday

741
00:59:08,655 --> 00:59:11,727
l'd rather die in bed,
surrounded by weeping women

742
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,445
Lots of flowers
and a stately funeral

743
00:59:15,375 --> 00:59:17,935
But what's the difference
if l die in a street?

744
00:59:18,575 --> 00:59:19,405
That's suicide!

745
00:59:22,815 --> 00:59:24,009
- What's wrong with him?
- Nothing!

746
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:28,013
He confronts hardships that
would topple a mountain!

747
00:59:30,495 --> 00:59:31,723
Only l can understand him

748
00:59:33,575 --> 00:59:34,564
Get back to your work

749
00:59:48,015 --> 00:59:49,334
How many students has he had?

750
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:52,968
He's educated at least one son
in every family

751
00:59:53,495 --> 00:59:56,055
He's taught a lot and given much

752
00:59:56,415 --> 01:00:00,488
With one hundred students, we can
recopy his work in two weeks

753
01:00:01,135 --> 01:00:02,693
Two copies of each book

754
01:00:03,255 --> 01:00:05,769
Nasser.. are there rumors
in the palace?

755
01:00:06,455 --> 01:00:09,413
- Let's make...
- Three copies of each!

756
01:00:10,175 --> 01:00:12,609
Manuela, Sarah and l
will work day and night

757
01:00:12,815 --> 01:00:15,534
Namuela? This is supposed
to be a secret!

758
01:00:15,735 --> 01:00:18,124
Manuela outrivals
you and your ancestors!

759
01:00:18,335 --> 01:00:20,291
She's educated!
She swears in 5 languages!

760
01:00:21,255 --> 01:00:22,688
l'll take a copy to France

761
01:00:22,895 --> 01:00:26,490
- lt's too dangerous!
- lt's to save my uncle's work

762
01:00:27,095 --> 01:00:28,972
l was thinking that...

763
01:00:29,215 --> 01:00:32,287
ls Blue Eyes predicting
the future again?

764
01:00:32,775 --> 01:00:35,335
Forget France!
l'll take them to Marrakesh

765
01:00:35,815 --> 01:00:37,168
Everyone's a relative there

766
01:00:37,615 --> 01:00:40,925
Joseph wants to help
and you give him a hard time!

767
01:00:41,175 --> 01:00:42,085
l'm starting now

768
01:00:42,655 --> 01:00:45,727
l know his work by heart.
l'll dictate

769
01:00:46,135 --> 01:00:48,490
l'll do these with Manuela
and Sarah

770
01:00:49,095 --> 01:00:52,451
lf you so much as blink,
l'll hang you from the minaret

771
01:00:52,735 --> 01:00:53,451
Understood?

772
01:01:02,215 --> 01:01:05,844
Uncle, Averroes must know
nothing of our voyages

773
01:01:06,055 --> 01:01:08,489
From me? My lips are sealed

774
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:18,083
#Wisdom guides the virtuous
theologian

775
01:01:18,295 --> 01:01:20,092
#in his study of what we call
"syllogism"

776
01:01:22,735 --> 01:01:25,488
#And divine law guides the
philosopher

777
01:01:25,695 --> 01:01:28,414
#in his study of what we call
"reason"

778
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:33,087
#Reason is the study of divine law.
Philosophy is the study of wisdom

779
01:01:33,495 --> 01:01:35,292
#Everything that has been
deduced

780
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:40,086
#from divine law is subject
to interpretation

781
01:01:40,975 --> 01:01:44,934
#No devout Muslim can doubt this

782
01:01:46,015 --> 01:01:49,644
#Reason is the sister
of divine law

783
01:01:50,175 --> 01:01:51,847
#The supposed conflict between them

784
01:01:52,055 --> 01:01:53,374
#is a malicious invention

785
01:02:06,495 --> 01:02:07,325
Taste this

786
01:02:08,495 --> 01:02:10,053
Why are you wearing all that?

787
01:02:10,535 --> 01:02:11,888
Have you caught cold?

788
01:02:14,135 --> 01:02:17,047
Aunt Zeinab, l want you to know...

789
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,004
you're like a mother to me

790
01:02:20,095 --> 01:02:20,811
Not now

791
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:22,371
Taste this

792
01:02:31,135 --> 01:02:33,285
Your blue eyes tell me
you're leaving

793
01:02:34,335 --> 01:02:35,211
You're going home?

794
01:02:39,975 --> 01:02:42,887
My heart tells me
you'll soon be back

795
01:02:43,775 --> 01:02:46,130
l'll put aside
a jar of dates for you

796
01:02:47,615 --> 01:02:49,924
l'll be back.. l promise

797
01:03:18,055 --> 01:03:20,250
lt's safer if you travel
by night

798
01:03:21,935 --> 01:03:23,812
lt's best if l mix with
the crowds

799
01:03:24,695 --> 01:03:27,732
lf my father had done that,
he'd still be alive

800
01:03:50,215 --> 01:03:51,330
You're like a brother

801
01:03:52,975 --> 01:03:56,490
But.. l'm in love with
someone else

802
01:03:57,775 --> 01:03:58,844
With Nasser

803
01:04:09,895 --> 01:04:13,604
My country is full of ignorance
and misery, but l love it

804
01:04:14,655 --> 01:04:17,965
l have to go pass on to them
what l've learned here

805
01:04:18,535 --> 01:04:19,854
Come what may?

806
01:04:21,255 --> 01:04:22,574
You really do love Averroes

807
01:04:23,935 --> 01:04:25,084
l'm not the only one..

808
01:04:27,815 --> 01:04:29,328
This is a letter for him

809
01:05:22,415 --> 01:05:25,771
That's his most important book.
Have a safe trip

810
01:05:26,655 --> 01:05:27,724
Tell your people

811
01:05:28,495 --> 01:05:31,612
that what we Arabs respect
most is loyalty

812
01:05:33,015 --> 01:05:36,974
And tell your people that
what we Christians respect most

813
01:05:37,775 --> 01:05:38,491
is honesty

814
01:05:39,215 --> 01:05:43,572
#The best moments of my life
were those l spent with you

815
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:46,252
#But what can be better

816
01:05:46,535 --> 01:05:49,811
#than saving books that will
enlighten mankind?

817
01:05:50,575 --> 01:05:53,373
#Your benevolence and kindness
have overwhelmed me

818
01:05:54,375 --> 01:05:56,206
#After everything l've learned,

819
01:05:56,655 --> 01:05:59,044
#l couldn't risk your
forbidding me to go

820
01:05:59,895 --> 01:06:03,604
#This decision comes from deep
within me. lt is entirely mine

821
01:06:04,495 --> 01:06:06,087
#lf you won't forgive me,

822
01:06:06,375 --> 01:06:08,093
#at least be indulgent

823
01:06:08,375 --> 01:06:10,730
#You said: "Wherever we are,
knowledge is a homeland

824
01:06:10,975 --> 01:06:12,966
#and ignorance, a foreign place"

825
01:06:13,215 --> 01:06:18,573
#l promise to return
to the land of humanism

826
01:06:19,535 --> 01:06:20,285
#and of love

827
01:06:20,855 --> 01:06:21,810
#Your son, Joseph

828
01:06:34,255 --> 01:06:37,964
Manuela thinks that Abdallah
has joined a sect

829
01:06:39,135 --> 01:06:40,932
They've been stalking him

830
01:06:41,135 --> 01:06:42,454
They nabbed him at the inn

831
01:06:43,455 --> 01:06:46,606
He kept going to the desert and
coming back covered with sand

832
01:06:47,615 --> 01:06:51,051
He told me to mind my own business.
Now he's gone again

833
01:06:51,655 --> 01:06:52,405
Does Marwan know?

834
01:06:52,615 --> 01:06:55,766
Marwan was half-dead and
Abdallah told him to pray

835
01:06:56,055 --> 01:06:59,252
He told me: "The real culprit
is in the palace"

836
01:06:59,575 --> 01:07:01,611
l said:
"Your father? You're crazy"

837
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:02,891
And you kept quiet?

838
01:07:03,135 --> 01:07:04,488
l thought he was avoiding Sarah

839
01:07:05,135 --> 01:07:06,887
What for?
What a bunch of idiots!

840
01:07:13,895 --> 01:07:15,089
Marwan, l need to see you

841
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,252
Did you know about Joseph?

842
01:07:19,575 --> 01:07:20,405
Yes, l did

843
01:07:20,895 --> 01:07:23,932
He can save your books
if he wants. We all can

844
01:07:30,135 --> 01:07:30,885
Stay seated

845
01:07:31,375 --> 01:07:33,605
What would a member of a sect
be learning

846
01:07:33,935 --> 01:07:35,653
in his third week of training?

847
01:07:38,215 --> 01:07:39,489
How to handle arms

848
01:07:40,055 --> 01:07:41,249
Where would that happen?

849
01:07:49,415 --> 01:07:51,849
Wait for the water to settle!

850
01:08:11,095 --> 01:08:12,084
What are you doing?

851
01:08:12,455 --> 01:08:14,491
The more water,
the more you see

852
01:08:16,135 --> 01:08:19,093
lf he knew you were improving
his invention,

853
01:08:19,375 --> 01:08:21,093
Alhazen would roll over
in his grave

854
01:08:22,935 --> 01:08:24,573
l'm here to find Abdallah

855
01:08:24,775 --> 01:08:25,571
That's all

856
01:08:29,775 --> 01:08:32,608
lt won't be easy to get in there

857
01:08:33,175 --> 01:08:35,325
lf you see him there,
come tell me

858
01:08:35,895 --> 01:08:38,090
Get some rest.
We'll keep watch

859
01:08:51,135 --> 01:08:52,011
Are you crazy?

860
01:08:52,695 --> 01:08:53,491
Here?

861
01:08:58,055 --> 01:08:59,454
lnstead of sitting around

862
01:09:00,135 --> 01:09:01,011
let's make a baby

863
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:04,967
lf we were able to,
Abdallah would worry us less

864
01:09:05,615 --> 01:09:07,606
So then, let's just make love

865
01:09:08,855 --> 01:09:10,413
Say yes and l'll get
Abdallah back

866
01:09:13,095 --> 01:09:14,892
lt'll help me concentrate

867
01:09:19,055 --> 01:09:20,886
You filthy brute!

868
01:09:21,135 --> 01:09:22,488
Worse than the gypsies!

869
01:09:23,375 --> 01:09:25,172
You're obsessed

870
01:09:26,575 --> 01:09:29,692
Hands off or l'll scratch out
your eyes

871
01:09:31,415 --> 01:09:34,725
And l'll pull out your hair

872
01:09:37,575 --> 01:09:38,405
Get it?

873
01:09:40,175 --> 01:09:40,971
Now you try

874
01:10:20,775 --> 01:10:22,925
Wait until you hear someone
shout "His Grace!"

875
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:24,124
Then get a good look

876
01:10:24,615 --> 01:10:27,288
He only shows his face
once a year

877
01:10:33,415 --> 01:10:34,245
Marwan, get up!

878
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:36,167
Abdallah's there! l saw him!

879
01:10:42,375 --> 01:10:43,967
His Grace!

880
01:11:00,855 --> 01:11:01,890
An angel..

881
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:08,965
There are a lot of them

882
01:11:39,735 --> 01:11:40,804
Protect the Emir!

883
01:11:44,495 --> 01:11:45,450
Have them move back!

884
01:11:46,815 --> 01:11:47,645
Get back!

885
01:11:48,575 --> 01:11:49,690
l want him on my horse

886
01:11:50,215 --> 01:11:52,570
Can't you hear?
Get him on the horse!

887
01:11:53,215 --> 01:11:54,011
Abdallah!

888
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:01,688
Tie his hands behind his back

889
01:12:11,855 --> 01:12:12,810
Go join the others

890
01:12:17,055 --> 01:12:18,010
You too

891
01:12:22,055 --> 01:12:22,885
Stand up!

892
01:15:52,575 --> 01:15:54,805
We're respecting our agreement
with Sheik Riad

893
01:15:56,255 --> 01:15:59,406
We attack in two weeks.
We expect Cordoba to be ready

894
01:16:00,015 --> 01:16:02,006
No fighting. No resistance

895
01:16:02,775 --> 01:16:04,174
Everything is in place

896
01:16:04,815 --> 01:16:07,454
Sheik Riad will seem
the perfect patriot

897
01:16:07,775 --> 01:16:09,254
l trust him implicitly

898
01:16:11,575 --> 01:16:16,126
Why would he risk losing what
he's strived for all these years?

899
01:16:16,815 --> 01:16:19,204
The battle will allow us
to eliminate Mansur

900
01:16:20,215 --> 01:16:22,729
- And his heirs?
- His sons?

901
01:16:22,975 --> 01:16:26,092
One babbles with the philosophers,
the other eats out of our hands

902
01:16:26,655 --> 01:16:27,451
And the philosophers?

903
01:16:27,695 --> 01:16:31,768
By the time they're understood,
we'll be in power

904
01:16:33,015 --> 01:16:36,212
- You're well-informed
- With all due modesty..

905
01:16:49,375 --> 01:16:51,843
Smuggling books.. what decadence!

906
01:17:44,895 --> 01:17:48,205
Where were you? The whole palace
is looking for you!

907
01:17:48,455 --> 01:17:52,004
"The infidels and blasphemers
will burn in Hell"

908
01:17:53,855 --> 01:17:55,004
Then to hell with all of us!

909
01:17:55,575 --> 01:17:57,088
Why were you with those
fanatics?

910
01:17:57,775 --> 01:17:59,288
You've made a mess of your life

911
01:17:59,735 --> 01:18:02,169
- You have no right to question me
- But l am

912
01:18:04,255 --> 01:18:05,608
Answer me!

913
01:18:09,055 --> 01:18:10,647
You want to kill Marwan?

914
01:18:11,655 --> 01:18:12,531
Why not kill me?

915
01:18:13,735 --> 01:18:14,531
Or our father?

916
01:18:16,215 --> 01:18:16,931
Kill him

917
01:18:18,175 --> 01:18:21,247
"They'll suffer shame in this world
and a mighty chastisement in the next"

918
01:18:29,815 --> 01:18:32,124
Out of my house, you lout!

919
01:18:32,415 --> 01:18:33,643
- Madwoman!
- Go away!

920
01:18:33,855 --> 01:18:35,573
He's the crown prince!

921
01:18:36,015 --> 01:18:37,687
Does that allow him
to hit his brother?

922
01:18:38,095 --> 01:18:41,644
This is my house! l pay the tithe.
So get out!

923
01:18:41,895 --> 01:18:43,089
Who is he?

924
01:18:43,295 --> 01:18:44,330
Just the crown prince

925
01:18:45,735 --> 01:18:47,487
Welcome to our humble home

926
01:18:47,695 --> 01:18:49,526
He's not welcome at all!

927
01:18:49,815 --> 01:18:50,486
Why not?

928
01:18:50,695 --> 01:18:52,845
He's a brute who hits
his brother!

929
01:18:53,055 --> 01:18:55,523
Your brother hits you
all the time

930
01:18:55,735 --> 01:18:56,724
He's a brute too!

931
01:18:57,215 --> 01:19:00,093
- Even your father. Look
- Mother, not now

932
01:19:00,295 --> 01:19:01,967
Stay put or you're dead!

933
01:19:02,175 --> 01:19:04,370
He'll stay here until he's
back in shape

934
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:11,410
You may be a son to me,
but none of your tricks

935
01:19:12,095 --> 01:19:14,450
Be a good boy. l'll make you
some saffron rice

936
01:19:20,015 --> 01:19:22,973
We'll celebrate. He'll sing
and dance like before

937
01:19:23,735 --> 01:19:24,804
Averroes was right

938
01:19:25,575 --> 01:19:27,293
Things are never as simple
as they seem

939
01:19:28,175 --> 01:19:30,006
Your assailants were like him

940
01:19:30,575 --> 01:19:31,769
He's a criminal too

941
01:19:32,735 --> 01:19:34,088
He should be punished

942
01:19:34,335 --> 01:19:35,131
He's your brother

943
01:19:37,055 --> 01:19:38,852
Where was he hiding
all this hate?

944
01:19:40,695 --> 01:19:42,526
Those lunatics unleashed it!

945
01:19:43,695 --> 01:19:47,324
They're experts at instilling hate

946
01:19:48,615 --> 01:19:49,491
Go ask Averroes

947
01:19:51,495 --> 01:19:53,213
He knows their methods now

948
01:19:59,775 --> 01:20:01,845
And he says to fight hate
with hate?

949
01:20:33,015 --> 01:20:38,009
The Christians are pushing us
into the sea

950
01:20:38,735 --> 01:20:40,646
You're busy playing
with the gypsies

951
01:20:41,095 --> 01:20:42,130
while l'm here all by myself

952
01:20:42,495 --> 01:20:44,326
building the greatest fleet
in history

953
01:20:44,615 --> 01:20:47,687
- This time, it's serious
- No more than any other time!

954
01:20:49,015 --> 01:20:53,247
Your lack of foresight makes you
an unworthy prince

955
01:20:53,455 --> 01:20:54,365
and an unworthy human being

956
01:20:54,575 --> 01:20:56,133
And you consider yourself
a worthy father?

957
01:20:58,655 --> 01:21:00,930
l'll forgive you.
They're not your words

958
01:21:02,815 --> 01:21:05,329
Averroes has managed
to turn you against me

959
01:21:06,255 --> 01:21:09,213
They kidnapped Abdallah
and shattered his will

960
01:21:09,415 --> 01:21:11,246
You told me he joined them
willingly

961
01:21:12,215 --> 01:21:14,524
They'll make a man of him

962
01:21:14,735 --> 01:21:17,693
- They'll make a criminal of him
- Keep him under guard

963
01:21:18,375 --> 01:21:20,809
What else can l do for you?

964
01:21:22,175 --> 01:21:23,528
Take us seriously

965
01:21:31,015 --> 01:21:32,334
l don't eat the food
of sinners

966
01:21:35,615 --> 01:21:37,446
You've become too skinny

967
01:21:38,175 --> 01:21:40,325
- Your heart...
- My heart is my business

968
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:44,813
Stomp on it, if you want.
But be careful..

969
01:21:45,255 --> 01:21:46,085
l'm in it

970
01:21:46,575 --> 01:21:48,850
God alone is in my heart

971
01:21:49,975 --> 01:21:51,693
But God is love

972
01:21:54,935 --> 01:21:57,244
Our Emir eats only a date a day

973
01:21:57,455 --> 01:21:59,810
But you said he was an angel

974
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:03,725
You and l are mortals.
Or have you become an angel?

975
01:22:04,895 --> 01:22:06,453
Eat. You're skin and bones

976
01:22:07,095 --> 01:22:09,655
"To withstand God's ordeals
is a virtue"

977
01:22:11,015 --> 01:22:12,243
Your brother is right

978
01:22:13,135 --> 01:22:14,568
They've hardened your heart

979
01:22:26,495 --> 01:22:27,405
Bon appetit!

980
01:22:36,975 --> 01:22:43,050
#Sing your song to your
heart's content

981
01:22:44,935 --> 01:22:50,089
#for we can still sing

982
01:22:54,255 --> 01:22:56,849
#And we'll keep on singing

983
01:22:57,255 --> 01:23:02,773
#day in, day out,
for the rest of our lives

984
01:23:39,535 --> 01:23:41,412
#And if ever one day

985
01:23:41,615 --> 01:23:43,606
#they try to break you,

986
01:23:43,975 --> 01:23:45,488
#stand up tall

987
01:23:45,695 --> 01:23:48,732
#like the proud palm tree

988
01:23:48,935 --> 01:23:52,211
#reaching up to the sky

989
01:23:52,415 --> 01:23:56,294
#Don't let them beat you.
Don't let them break you

990
01:24:01,975 --> 01:24:03,772
#Don't let them scare you

991
01:24:04,135 --> 01:24:08,174
#Be like a dream,
blossoming in the desert

992
01:24:08,375 --> 01:24:12,846
#Sing your song to your
heart's content,

993
01:24:13,055 --> 01:24:16,730
#for we can still sing

994
01:24:17,975 --> 01:24:19,727
Only dancing can bring him
back to us

995
01:24:32,415 --> 01:24:35,532
#Your song, resounding amongst
mankind,

996
01:24:35,775 --> 01:24:39,006
#will make the night's heart
beat with joy

997
01:24:39,455 --> 01:24:43,812
#and heal the wounds
of the innocent

998
01:24:58,055 --> 01:24:59,283
#Will you dance?

999
01:25:00,255 --> 01:25:01,165
#l will too

1000
01:25:01,575 --> 01:25:03,531
#Despite myself, l'll dance too

1001
01:25:03,775 --> 01:25:06,926
#Despite myself.. despite myself..
l'll dance too

1002
01:25:08,215 --> 01:25:11,605
#Until your dream
is entwined with mine..

1003
01:25:11,815 --> 01:25:16,935
#despite myself, l'll dance too

1004
01:26:06,255 --> 01:26:08,769
Soon enough, you'll be dancing
in hell!

1005
01:26:11,215 --> 01:26:12,250
Maybe. But look at you

1006
01:26:12,575 --> 01:26:15,248
You've made your hell on earth!

1007
01:27:11,895 --> 01:27:12,805
Get off your horse

1008
01:27:22,375 --> 01:27:25,412
Kneel down and beg for mercy

1009
01:27:40,655 --> 01:27:41,485
Perfect

1010
01:28:05,095 --> 01:28:06,244
Marwan!

1011
01:28:12,695 --> 01:28:15,004
All infidels will meet
the same fate

1012
01:28:15,335 --> 01:28:18,054
We shall purge society
of the vile Mansur

1013
01:28:19,095 --> 01:28:24,044
The country will now live according
to the precepts of God, His Prophet,

1014
01:28:24,575 --> 01:28:25,724
and his successor

1015
01:29:15,735 --> 01:29:19,091
You're faced with the choice
of a lifetime

1016
01:29:21,135 --> 01:29:22,409
lf you want to,

1017
01:29:24,175 --> 01:29:25,893
take my horse, follow them

1018
01:29:40,175 --> 01:29:44,373
l wish it had been you
who delivered the mortal blow

1019
01:29:46,375 --> 01:29:51,449
To die by your hand

1020
01:30:50,535 --> 01:30:51,411
He's dead!

1021
01:30:51,735 --> 01:30:52,611
Murderer!

1022
01:31:13,855 --> 01:31:15,288
l'm to blame for Marwan's death

1023
01:31:16,975 --> 01:31:17,930
How presumptuous!

1024
01:31:19,055 --> 01:31:20,647
He alone decided to die

1025
01:31:21,255 --> 01:31:23,086
For him, saving you was a duty

1026
01:31:23,775 --> 01:31:25,731
- l'd never have thought...
- Thought?

1027
01:31:26,935 --> 01:31:30,245
You let others do the thinking
for you

1028
01:31:30,895 --> 01:31:35,207
lf you want a shoulder to cry on,
a word of warning:

1029
01:31:35,775 --> 01:31:38,414
l'm neither Marwan, nor your father

1030
01:31:38,615 --> 01:31:41,129
- Marwan wasn't my father
- He chose to be

1031
01:31:41,735 --> 01:31:44,044
That's far more noble
than giving life

1032
01:31:46,255 --> 01:31:47,734
He taught you to love life

1033
01:31:50,975 --> 01:31:52,203
And he paid the price

1034
01:31:59,855 --> 01:32:02,927
My real father never cared
about me

1035
01:32:04,015 --> 01:32:05,164
Every man has his limits

1036
01:32:06,535 --> 01:32:08,685
Your father can't give
what he hasn't got

1037
01:32:10,575 --> 01:32:11,928
You're no longer a child

1038
01:32:12,695 --> 01:32:14,367
You're responsible for
your choices

1039
01:32:16,295 --> 01:32:21,415
You're too old to whine:
"Mother hit me, Father neglected me

1040
01:32:21,615 --> 01:32:22,684
"and he preferred my brother

1041
01:32:22,935 --> 01:32:26,814
"l hate the whole world
so l'll accuse it of being impious"

1042
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:28,205
That's too easy

1043
01:32:29,815 --> 01:32:34,445
Too easy to justify the laziness,
hatred and jealousy

1044
01:32:34,655 --> 01:32:36,373
you carry within yourself
by blaming it on others

1045
01:32:39,215 --> 01:32:40,614
Do you aspire to greatness?

1046
01:32:42,015 --> 01:32:44,768
You'll reach it by doing
something for others

1047
01:32:46,175 --> 01:32:48,643
What's impious is reveling
in your hatred

1048
01:32:49,175 --> 01:32:50,449
That's heresy!

1049
01:32:50,775 --> 01:32:54,484
- l want to spread God's word
- Whose do l spread? The Devil's ?

1050
01:32:55,895 --> 01:32:56,645
You?

1051
01:32:58,575 --> 01:32:59,894
Spreading God's word?

1052
01:33:01,655 --> 01:33:02,690
How presumptuous

1053
01:33:04,215 --> 01:33:08,003
You're so hollow, you repeat
whatever nonsense you're told

1054
01:33:09,495 --> 01:33:12,612
Learn a poem and a Koranic verse
and you're a poet and scholar?

1055
01:33:16,695 --> 01:33:19,493
What do you know about
medicine and astronomy,

1056
01:33:20,375 --> 01:33:23,094
about mathematics and chemistry,

1057
01:33:24,935 --> 01:33:25,811
about philosophy?

1058
01:33:29,015 --> 01:33:30,368
Do you know enough about love,

1059
01:33:31,895 --> 01:33:32,691
about truth,

1060
01:33:34,695 --> 01:33:35,525
about justice

1061
01:33:37,215 --> 01:33:39,206
to claim to be able to spread
God's word?

1062
01:33:40,775 --> 01:33:41,525
Answer me!

1063
01:33:46,375 --> 01:33:49,845
Why do l keep on writing?

1064
01:33:50,415 --> 01:33:52,406
My idea don't reach anyone
anymore!

1065
01:33:55,615 --> 01:33:58,687
Why should l wait for them
to burn my books?

1066
01:33:59,335 --> 01:34:00,927
l'll burn them myself!

1067
01:34:01,655 --> 01:34:03,486
lt's every man for himself!

1068
01:34:06,455 --> 01:34:07,604
Let them burn!

1069
01:34:09,615 --> 01:34:11,253
Keep out of it!

1070
01:34:11,455 --> 01:34:12,808
l'm not an animal!

1071
01:34:13,015 --> 01:34:14,687
Animals have more heart

1072
01:34:15,055 --> 01:34:16,408
than you and your sect!

1073
01:34:17,295 --> 01:34:18,171
Do you understand?

1074
01:34:29,175 --> 01:34:29,971
Zeinab!

1075
01:34:36,095 --> 01:34:37,892
l was worse with him
than they were

1076
01:34:39,135 --> 01:34:39,965
God forgive me

1077
01:34:56,415 --> 01:34:58,645
You kicked me out of your house

1078
01:34:58,855 --> 01:35:00,652
And l'll do it again

1079
01:35:00,855 --> 01:35:01,765
Do you want me to leave?

1080
01:35:02,735 --> 01:35:06,444
Nasser was Marwan's best friend.
He's come to console you

1081
01:35:11,695 --> 01:35:13,094
You were all so handsome

1082
01:35:14,735 --> 01:35:18,250
Three suns which merged
into one

1083
01:35:21,375 --> 01:35:22,205
Nasser

1084
01:35:23,775 --> 01:35:24,685
Joseph

1085
01:35:27,775 --> 01:35:28,810
and Marwan

1086
01:35:30,255 --> 01:35:33,088
l've come to thank you
for the joy you gave him

1087
01:35:34,535 --> 01:35:37,368
Thanks to you, not only Marwan,
but all of us

1088
01:35:39,095 --> 01:35:40,687
learned about the joy of life

1089
01:35:45,975 --> 01:35:46,964
Still here?

1090
01:35:47,895 --> 01:35:49,613
You're not with your "friends" ?

1091
01:35:50,415 --> 01:35:51,734
Marwan had to die?

1092
01:35:52,135 --> 01:35:54,126
- Nasser!
- How can you allow him here?

1093
01:35:57,095 --> 01:36:00,451
Marwan always looked after
Abdallah like a son

1094
01:36:03,375 --> 01:36:06,492
Can't we forget?
Can't we forgive?

1095
01:36:11,135 --> 01:36:13,933
Console him. He's lost his
father... Marwan

1096
01:36:55,815 --> 01:37:01,333
Sing your song to your
heart's content,

1097
01:37:01,615 --> 01:37:06,166
for we can still sing

1098
01:37:42,735 --> 01:37:43,406
Nasser!

1099
01:37:44,895 --> 01:37:46,647
Don't let yourself be blinded
by hate

1100
01:38:57,015 --> 01:39:00,052
Saving this one book
was worth all the risks

1101
01:39:05,295 --> 01:39:08,605
Read me something from it

1102
01:39:21,655 --> 01:39:22,644
l'm going back

1103
01:39:31,855 --> 01:39:34,289
You're resigning,
like a lowly employee?

1104
01:39:35,015 --> 01:39:36,164
Go, if you want to

1105
01:39:36,695 --> 01:39:39,163
No one is indispensable to me

1106
01:39:39,575 --> 01:39:42,328
l'll find ten others like you

1107
01:39:42,775 --> 01:39:44,845
lt's my father who appointed you

1108
01:39:45,135 --> 01:39:46,648
l inherited you from him

1109
01:39:46,855 --> 01:39:48,527
ln that case, l may go..

1110
01:39:48,775 --> 01:39:49,685
You may not!

1111
01:39:50,655 --> 01:39:53,772
You're a commoner now.
You're subject to my whims

1112
01:39:55,935 --> 01:39:56,685
Dismissed!

1113
01:40:03,615 --> 01:40:05,890
All this fuss over the death
of a cockroach

1114
01:40:06,615 --> 01:40:09,175
They claim responsibility
for Marwan's death

1115
01:40:09,415 --> 01:40:11,724
and menace their enemies
with the same

1116
01:40:11,975 --> 01:40:14,125
They undermine justice
and your authority

1117
01:40:15,095 --> 01:40:16,244
Riad rules the streets

1118
01:40:16,975 --> 01:40:20,285
Are you sure it's Sheik Riad
who rules the streets?

1119
01:40:22,935 --> 01:40:24,288
Or is it you?

1120
01:40:25,255 --> 01:40:26,005
Why not?

1121
01:40:26,735 --> 01:40:28,293
l'm not interested in power

1122
01:40:28,575 --> 01:40:32,011
But you're interested in glory.
ln immortality

1123
01:40:33,175 --> 01:40:34,574
Living on for posterity

1124
01:40:37,455 --> 01:40:40,572
Don't worry. Sheik Riad knows
his limits

1125
01:40:40,775 --> 01:40:42,128
Let's hope so

1126
01:40:43,455 --> 01:40:45,366
Show me a man who is not
a slave to his pride

1127
01:40:45,575 --> 01:40:47,531
His place is in my heart

1128
01:40:48,255 --> 01:40:49,210
You hate me

1129
01:40:50,655 --> 01:40:52,532
l hate ignorance and vanity

1130
01:40:53,255 --> 01:40:56,247
- You think l'm vain?
- l think Sheik Riad is

1131
01:40:58,415 --> 01:41:01,885
No need to fear.
l'm more clever than he is

1132
01:41:03,295 --> 01:41:04,205
Sit down

1133
01:41:06,615 --> 01:41:08,094
Such is politics

1134
01:41:08,335 --> 01:41:10,451
Politics without morality
is doomed to failure

1135
01:41:11,495 --> 01:41:15,283
Don't you see? The political
situation decides for us

1136
01:41:16,975 --> 01:41:18,454
Our conscience should decide

1137
01:41:20,735 --> 01:41:23,488
lf l didn't owe you some respect,
l'd destroy you

1138
01:41:25,175 --> 01:41:27,973
Destroy me rather than both
yourself and the country

1139
01:41:56,375 --> 01:41:57,364
l won't write anymore

1140
01:41:57,695 --> 01:42:01,165
Then they've won.
They've broken you

1141
01:42:01,815 --> 01:42:02,930
and severed you from Mansur

1142
01:42:03,135 --> 01:42:07,253
Had l stayed with him, l'd have
ended up hating him or myself

1143
01:42:08,055 --> 01:42:11,172
lf you could hate him,
you wouldn't be grieving

1144
01:42:12,375 --> 01:42:16,163
A friend who is spurned seeks
revenge. He despises himself

1145
01:42:17,415 --> 01:42:19,645
for the love he once gave

1146
01:42:19,935 --> 01:42:21,084
lt's just me and you

1147
01:42:21,535 --> 01:42:25,005
l esteem neither your politics
nor your company

1148
01:42:25,455 --> 01:42:26,854
l'm not thrilled about
yours either

1149
01:42:27,615 --> 01:42:30,812
Go console your friend
in his fall

1150
01:42:31,335 --> 01:42:33,803
- Providence is on his side
- And not on mine?

1151
01:42:34,935 --> 01:42:37,130
l thought no one was
indispensable to you

1152
01:43:04,935 --> 01:43:05,924
Can we really expect...

1153
01:43:08,575 --> 01:43:11,806
Can we expect a man to be
a great strategist,

1154
01:43:12,095 --> 01:43:15,610
a great leader and a good,
loving father?

1155
01:43:15,815 --> 01:43:17,407
We ask nothing of your father

1156
01:43:17,935 --> 01:43:21,007
He is what he is.
We must make our own way

1157
01:43:23,975 --> 01:43:24,851
My way is...

1158
01:43:26,015 --> 01:43:26,845
to Egypt

1159
01:43:28,295 --> 01:43:29,523
Tomorrow at dawn

1160
01:43:29,975 --> 01:43:33,172
Now that's a decision!
You better stick to it

1161
01:43:33,535 --> 01:43:36,368
- You agree?
- l agree if the decision is yours,

1162
01:43:36,815 --> 01:43:39,852
if you put your father behind you,
if you forgive Abdallah

1163
01:43:40,095 --> 01:43:42,290
and if you say you love me
as l love you

1164
01:43:45,695 --> 01:43:46,844
You're in love with Joseph

1165
01:43:47,535 --> 01:43:50,845
The day he left, you stared into
his eyes from the roof

1166
01:43:51,095 --> 01:43:53,086
My mother likes his blue eyes too

1167
01:43:53,295 --> 01:43:54,808
l saw you kiss him!

1168
01:43:55,935 --> 01:43:57,368
He's the one who kissed me

1169
01:43:59,855 --> 01:44:02,653
When you leave, l'll go to the roof
and stare at you

1170
01:44:04,295 --> 01:44:05,125
Will you?

1171
01:44:05,575 --> 01:44:08,533
Swear to God that you'll
marry me

1172
01:44:08,735 --> 01:44:11,090
- Another decision!
- l'll tell your father

1173
01:44:11,295 --> 01:44:12,728
- He knows l love you
- You told him?

1174
01:44:13,015 --> 01:44:14,414
- My mother did
- She knows?

1175
01:44:14,615 --> 01:44:16,685
Everyone knows but you

1176
01:44:22,095 --> 01:44:25,167
Go. When you come back,
my trousseau will be ready

1177
01:44:34,695 --> 01:44:36,128
l'll go faster than my shadow

1178
01:44:37,055 --> 01:44:39,808
Father will refuse your trip
and our marriage

1179
01:44:40,095 --> 01:44:42,450
- l demand both
- Or nothing at all

1180
01:44:43,295 --> 01:44:44,364
We'll stand up to him

1181
01:44:45,095 --> 01:44:47,290
The two of us... together

1182
01:44:54,015 --> 01:44:56,165
What are you waiting for?

1183
01:44:57,095 --> 01:44:59,734
Someone's permission?
Joseph would have...

1184
01:45:06,135 --> 01:45:09,445
Let them burn my books!
Someone else can write them!

1185
01:45:09,655 --> 01:45:12,089
Great thinkers don't grow on trees!

1186
01:45:13,055 --> 01:45:15,489
Too bad. Such is my destiny
and that of the nation

1187
01:45:15,815 --> 01:45:18,045
l'm scared, but l'm letting
him go

1188
01:45:18,255 --> 01:45:20,485
You write books to incite
people,

1189
01:45:20,695 --> 01:45:23,084
to rouse them,
to make them think!

1190
01:45:23,295 --> 01:45:26,014
We have a right to take a stand
and share the risks!

1191
01:45:26,375 --> 01:45:28,411
She sounds just like her father!

1192
01:45:28,655 --> 01:45:30,646
Thank God she looks like
her mother!

1193
01:45:30,935 --> 01:45:32,766
Quiet! My husband is gorgeous!

1194
01:45:34,015 --> 01:45:36,165
l have to take responsibility
for my decisions

1195
01:45:36,375 --> 01:45:36,966
Exactly

1196
01:45:37,175 --> 01:45:39,325
Besides, l'm the Caliph's son

1197
01:45:39,535 --> 01:45:40,809
l'll make myself respected

1198
01:45:41,415 --> 01:45:43,246
No one will be able to stop me

1199
01:45:43,655 --> 01:45:46,249
He's already proved his worth

1200
01:45:47,335 --> 01:45:48,973
Salma and l are for

1201
01:45:49,495 --> 01:45:50,928
He and l are against

1202
01:45:51,295 --> 01:45:52,011
Are we?

1203
01:45:52,215 --> 01:45:53,364
How about me?

1204
01:45:54,255 --> 01:45:57,770
Salma and Nasser are for.
You and Abu Yehia are against

1205
01:45:59,095 --> 01:46:00,494
l've always played fair

1206
01:46:03,215 --> 01:46:06,173
l'm with them.
That makes three against two

1207
01:46:07,495 --> 01:46:08,564
lsn't that right?

1208
01:46:11,175 --> 01:46:12,927
You're always right, my love

1209
01:46:13,175 --> 01:46:16,133
Go... No one can deprive
the world of wisdom

1210
01:46:16,495 --> 01:46:17,291
God keep you

1211
01:46:20,015 --> 01:46:21,334
l'll do our children proud

1212
01:46:25,335 --> 01:46:26,484
As soon as we have some

1213
01:46:56,535 --> 01:46:57,411
Where are they?

1214
01:46:57,895 --> 01:47:00,807
Here and there. They're
approaching Guadalquivir

1215
01:47:02,455 --> 01:47:05,572
They're a stone's throw away.
Where did we go wrong?

1216
01:47:05,855 --> 01:47:09,211
After Alarcos, we wasted
our fighting forces

1217
01:47:09,695 --> 01:47:13,085
in futile battles.
Our army has suffered

1218
01:47:13,535 --> 01:47:14,934
Nothing l do is futile

1219
01:47:16,815 --> 01:47:17,531
Sire...

1220
01:47:26,335 --> 01:47:28,644
The enemy is here
and we jabber away

1221
01:47:28,855 --> 01:47:32,245
How about the enemies within?
They're undermining your power

1222
01:47:32,535 --> 01:47:34,651
Your friend Averroes warned you

1223
01:47:35,175 --> 01:47:38,485
lf you mention his name again,
l'll throw you in jail!

1224
01:47:38,695 --> 01:47:40,208
Go ahead. You're the Caliph

1225
01:47:40,735 --> 01:47:42,965
People bow,
even when you fart!

1226
01:47:43,175 --> 01:47:44,972
lt's Averroes who divided
the nation!

1227
01:47:45,655 --> 01:47:48,965
He just happens to resign
when the enemy attacks

1228
01:47:49,375 --> 01:47:52,845
He just happens to send my son
God knows where

1229
01:47:53,135 --> 01:47:55,695
And the enemy happens
to read his books!

1230
01:47:56,255 --> 01:47:57,654
Do they contain military
secrets?

1231
01:47:58,455 --> 01:47:59,934
ldeas belong to all of mankind

1232
01:48:00,255 --> 01:48:04,294
Our kingdom was born of an idea.
ldeas will live on

1233
01:48:04,535 --> 01:48:07,732
long after you and l fall
into oblivion

1234
01:48:07,935 --> 01:48:11,610
l'll win this battle.
lt's his ideas that will perish

1235
01:48:11,935 --> 01:48:15,211
ldeas have wings.
No one can stop their flight

1236
01:48:15,655 --> 01:48:16,531
l can!

1237
01:48:17,735 --> 01:48:20,852
l'll have all his books burnt!
l'll banish him!

1238
01:48:21,055 --> 01:48:23,774
lt'll be the end of Almohad
culture and all of Andalusia

1239
01:48:26,695 --> 01:48:27,684
l am Andalusia!

1240
01:48:30,295 --> 01:48:31,125
Not him!

1241
01:48:36,815 --> 01:48:37,804
Open the doors!

1242
01:48:40,295 --> 01:48:41,648
Show Sheik Riad in

1243
01:48:51,495 --> 01:48:52,769
Can you rally the people?

1244
01:48:53,615 --> 01:48:54,365
Of course

1245
01:48:55,455 --> 01:48:56,490
How long will it take?

1246
01:48:57,095 --> 01:48:58,972
A day... a moment...

1247
01:49:00,135 --> 01:49:01,488
They're waiting for you

1248
01:49:02,815 --> 01:49:06,888
Ever since our glorious Saladin
- God bless his soul -

1249
01:49:07,335 --> 01:49:12,011
set Jerusalem free, unifying
Arab people the world over,

1250
01:49:12,815 --> 01:49:14,726
Christians have sought revenge

1251
01:49:15,295 --> 01:49:18,253
Their one wish is to destroy
our empire

1252
01:49:19,255 --> 01:49:22,884
which has enlightened the world
for over six centuries

1253
01:49:23,735 --> 01:49:27,444
They want Andalusia to sink back
into misery and ignorance

1254
01:49:28,855 --> 01:49:33,849
They'll burn our homes, kill our
children. They want our blood

1255
01:49:34,935 --> 01:49:35,731
Can we let

1256
01:49:37,655 --> 01:49:39,611
the enemy take back the land

1257
01:49:39,895 --> 01:49:43,649
which our forefathers turned
into a paragon of civilization?

1258
01:49:44,095 --> 01:49:45,050
Can we?

1259
01:49:45,495 --> 01:49:47,850
God has given us a leader

1260
01:49:48,495 --> 01:49:51,009
even more glorious than
Saladin!

1261
01:49:52,255 --> 01:49:55,247
Our mentor is pure.
He is courageous

1262
01:49:55,455 --> 01:49:56,570
and inspired

1263
01:49:56,975 --> 01:49:59,364
Mansur the Victorious!

1264
01:50:00,015 --> 01:50:02,483
Commander of the believers
of Andalusia!

1265
01:50:08,815 --> 01:50:12,364
We are your soldiers,
Victorious One!

1266
01:50:24,215 --> 01:50:25,614
Glorious believers..

1267
01:50:29,975 --> 01:50:34,969
The world will soon know that
Paradise is for the pure of heart

1268
01:50:50,415 --> 01:50:51,609
What happened, Sheik Riad?

1269
01:50:53,335 --> 01:50:54,688
You left during my speech

1270
01:50:55,255 --> 01:50:58,053
lt is you who inspires
the people

1271
01:50:58,415 --> 01:50:59,643
You and you alone

1272
01:51:00,095 --> 01:51:02,848
Whatever you say arouses
their enthusiasm

1273
01:51:03,655 --> 01:51:05,725
They hung upon your every word

1274
01:51:07,015 --> 01:51:09,768
There's no use talking about
land and honor

1275
01:51:10,895 --> 01:51:11,611
Just tell them

1276
01:51:12,815 --> 01:51:16,046
it's God's will.
Every one of them will obey

1277
01:51:16,255 --> 01:51:19,452
You're a real saint.
And a clever one at that

1278
01:51:24,175 --> 01:51:27,053
For foundering in the ocean
of illusion

1279
01:51:27,415 --> 01:51:29,087
and obscuring the people's
judgement,

1280
01:51:29,295 --> 01:51:31,365
the Caliph forbids the following
people from teaching

1281
01:51:31,655 --> 01:51:33,611
in schools and mosques.
Furthermore, the Caliph orders

1282
01:51:34,535 --> 01:51:36,685
that their books be burnt
in public

1283
01:51:37,255 --> 01:51:40,406
and that they be banished

1284
01:51:41,055 --> 01:51:43,774
lt's Averroes!

1285
01:52:18,295 --> 01:52:19,410
Are you hurt?

1286
01:52:47,175 --> 01:52:50,247
Al-Razi, only you can be
entrusted with this

1287
01:52:50,815 --> 01:52:53,568
l don't always agree with
what Averroes says,

1288
01:52:54,095 --> 01:52:55,733
but under such circumstances

1289
01:52:56,095 --> 01:52:58,928
it is my duty to save
these books

1290
01:52:59,135 --> 01:53:02,684
My father has great respect
for Averroes, but...

1291
01:53:02,975 --> 01:53:06,684
He ordered these books burnt
and their author banished

1292
01:53:06,935 --> 01:53:08,209
lt will soon take effect

1293
01:53:08,615 --> 01:53:10,287
l learned of this yesterday

1294
01:53:10,815 --> 01:53:12,009
Sheik Riad has won

1295
01:53:13,255 --> 01:53:15,530
Run back to Averroes

1296
01:53:16,015 --> 01:53:17,767
lf he sees his books burn

1297
01:53:18,055 --> 01:53:19,886
without knowing they've
been saved,

1298
01:53:20,175 --> 01:53:21,893
he'd die

1299
01:53:37,295 --> 01:53:40,207
"Commentary on Aristotle
by Averroes of Andalusia"

1300
01:53:46,295 --> 01:53:49,048
"The lncoherence of lncoherence"

1301
01:53:51,295 --> 01:53:55,174
#Subjective, conflicting
interpretations of divine law

1302
01:53:55,855 --> 01:53:58,494
#which assert their veracity
above all others

1303
01:53:59,295 --> 01:54:00,808
#have torn the country apart

1304
01:54:01,975 --> 01:54:06,207
#We are all to be held responsible
for these rifts,

1305
01:54:06,775 --> 01:54:07,730
#for these schisms

1306
01:54:08,295 --> 01:54:09,614
Tell her she's wrong!

1307
01:54:10,135 --> 01:54:11,887
No, your mother is right

1308
01:54:15,615 --> 01:54:17,412
Everything stays but the bench

1309
01:54:17,655 --> 01:54:19,885
Take the cupboard while
you're at it!

1310
01:54:30,815 --> 01:54:31,691
Remember?

1311
01:54:32,575 --> 01:54:34,327
Life is so cruel with us

1312
01:54:34,855 --> 01:54:36,129
Leaving everything...

1313
01:54:37,495 --> 01:54:41,010
We've been through worse.
As long as we're together...

1314
01:54:41,255 --> 01:54:42,529
we'll pull through

1315
01:54:44,375 --> 01:54:45,125
Tell me

1316
01:54:46,695 --> 01:54:47,889
Do you remember this bench?

1317
01:54:49,495 --> 01:54:52,805
Of course l do.
l thought you'd forgotten

1318
01:54:53,575 --> 01:54:54,644
Our first night..

1319
01:54:55,735 --> 01:54:58,886
On the bench.. God forgive you!

1320
01:55:15,215 --> 01:55:38,892
Thank God, you're safe

1321
01:55:54,495 --> 01:55:55,530
Nasser's back

1322
01:55:56,495 --> 01:55:57,564
l want him docile

1323
01:55:58,895 --> 01:56:00,248
or l want him dead

1324
01:56:07,095 --> 01:56:09,484
Meeting like this is a true
blessing

1325
01:56:10,575 --> 01:56:11,291
lndeed

1326
01:56:13,055 --> 01:56:15,250
l'm going to betray one of
Sheik Riad's secrets

1327
01:56:17,615 --> 01:56:19,287
The Spaniards want peace

1328
01:56:19,775 --> 01:56:20,764
Who wouldn't ?

1329
01:56:21,895 --> 01:56:24,284
"lf they incline to peace,
incline to it"

1330
01:56:25,055 --> 01:56:29,333
They want us to reduce the army
and give out some gifts

1331
01:56:29,975 --> 01:56:33,047
to pacify the people
and make them amenable

1332
01:56:33,535 --> 01:56:38,290
Trade will thrive.
We all stand to profit from it

1333
01:56:38,935 --> 01:56:41,688
What does the Caliph
of Andalusia think?

1334
01:56:43,455 --> 01:56:45,525
My father is the Caliph
of Andalusia

1335
01:56:46,455 --> 01:56:47,205
Al-Mansur

1336
01:56:47,935 --> 01:56:51,405
He's given enough.
He deserves a long rest

1337
01:57:44,295 --> 01:57:46,126
l've been trained to kill you

1338
01:57:47,615 --> 01:57:48,365
From behind?

1339
01:57:50,535 --> 01:57:51,365
Go ahead..

1340
01:57:52,415 --> 01:57:55,009
Won't your hand obey?
Do it

1341
01:57:55,695 --> 01:57:58,732
l could have if they'd
reached my heart

1342
01:57:59,655 --> 01:58:02,328
But they only played
with my mind

1343
01:58:03,455 --> 01:58:04,285
Who's "they" ?

1344
01:58:04,615 --> 01:58:07,049
Those you wish to please
by burning his books

1345
01:58:24,655 --> 01:58:25,804
Justice is done!

1346
01:58:32,615 --> 01:58:33,365
Too late

1347
01:58:53,135 --> 01:58:55,091
l know your books are safe
in Egypt

1348
01:58:56,495 --> 01:58:57,245
Of course

1349
01:59:05,975 --> 01:59:07,772
Abdallah almost killed me

1350
01:59:10,935 --> 01:59:14,723
Sheik Riad has sided with
the Spaniards

1351
01:59:17,735 --> 01:59:19,293
l was offered your throne

1352
01:59:23,655 --> 01:59:24,804
They lost

1353
01:59:27,295 --> 01:59:28,694
l'm ready to fight now

1354
01:59:29,215 --> 01:59:29,965
So am l

1355
01:59:38,055 --> 01:59:41,411
Heaven has answered your prayers,
Sheik Riad. Enter

1356
01:59:58,335 --> 02:00:00,326
Not thwarting Averroes' plans

1357
02:00:01,095 --> 02:00:02,733
would have been disastrous

1358
02:00:03,295 --> 02:00:05,126
He can do us no more harm

1359
02:00:06,255 --> 02:00:11,010
Now that we are unified, we can
confront the enemy together

1360
02:00:12,055 --> 02:00:16,014
You and your sects will go
to the front line

1361
02:00:17,255 --> 02:00:18,244
As a shield

1362
02:00:18,655 --> 02:00:21,886
An example for those willing
to die in the name of lslam

1363
02:00:23,055 --> 02:00:27,094
Victory or death..
both lead to Paradise

1364
02:00:27,455 --> 02:00:29,889
- l'm not a warrior
- Come now!

1365
02:00:30,375 --> 02:00:32,935
Your eloquence alone
gets the masses marching!

1366
02:00:36,055 --> 02:00:38,250
Have you nothing to say,
Sheik Riad?

1367
02:00:40,295 --> 02:00:41,614
Who'll run the country?

1368
02:00:42,775 --> 02:00:44,731
No one. lt will run itself

1369
02:00:44,935 --> 02:00:49,053
- The philosophers can do no more harm
- l'm an old man

1370
02:00:49,255 --> 02:00:52,645
Don't underestimate yourself!
You're in fine health!

1371
02:00:52,935 --> 02:00:54,926
l know my dream will come true

1372
02:00:56,215 --> 02:00:58,729
l saw you leading the army,
charging with the troops,

1373
02:00:59,015 --> 02:01:02,530
dressed in white, a sword in hand

1374
02:01:02,735 --> 02:01:05,807
- l've never held a weapon
- Now's your chance!

1375
02:01:06,055 --> 02:01:09,525
The mettle of a warrior
is apparent only in battle

1376
02:01:09,735 --> 02:01:11,532
- Sword against sword
- Take mine

1377
02:01:11,815 --> 02:01:15,125
We know that the enemy
is gathering near Jaen

1378
02:01:15,575 --> 02:01:18,885
Get your men ready.
We attack at daybreak

1379
02:01:23,015 --> 02:01:24,414
We're attacking them at Jaen?

1380
02:01:25,255 --> 02:01:29,328
That's what our new "general"
will tell them

1381
02:01:29,615 --> 02:01:32,175
- We'll attack at Alarcos
- Perfect

1382
02:01:32,615 --> 02:01:33,491
Sire...

1383
02:01:36,655 --> 02:01:37,974
Averroes' books are safe

1384
02:01:39,655 --> 02:01:41,247
l took a copy of each to Egypt

1385
02:01:43,815 --> 02:01:44,770
Thank God

1386
02:01:45,815 --> 02:01:47,533
That was a wise thing to do.
Thank you

1387
02:01:48,735 --> 02:01:49,611
May l tell him?

1388
02:01:50,935 --> 02:01:52,687
We set off in an hour

1389
02:01:52,895 --> 02:01:53,611
l won't be long

1390
02:02:01,135 --> 02:02:03,330
Will you restore him
his honors?

1391
02:02:04,655 --> 02:02:08,091
l accused him of treason.
Shall l contradict myself now?

1392
02:02:09,575 --> 02:02:11,691
What made you fall into
your own trap?

1393
02:02:16,975 --> 02:02:17,771
Vanity

1394
02:02:31,215 --> 02:02:32,967
The books! They're safe!

1395
02:02:33,255 --> 02:02:38,204
Sarah, Manuela, his books
are safe in Egypt!

1396
02:02:44,935 --> 02:02:46,254
That's Aunt Zeinab!

1397
02:02:47,055 --> 02:02:49,569
Move away! We have to
congratulate him!

1398
02:03:11,255 --> 02:03:13,928
- l'll marry you when l come back
- No, now!

1399
02:03:14,855 --> 02:03:15,731
Wait

1400
02:03:17,175 --> 02:03:18,005
l'll be back

1401
02:03:19,335 --> 02:03:20,085
Just a moment

1402
02:03:30,255 --> 02:03:31,131
Thank you

1403
02:03:33,415 --> 02:03:34,211
Thank you

1404
02:03:34,415 --> 02:03:35,484
A thousand thanks..

1405
02:04:08,975 --> 02:04:14,766
ldeas have wings.
No one can stop their flight
