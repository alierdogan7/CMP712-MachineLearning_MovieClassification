1
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,835
Dear Priya, it's me

2
00:01:38,876 --> 00:01:42,505
And this is the bucket that
I'd started filling with my tears...

3
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,441
two months ago, while leaving
my friends in Delhi

4
00:01:47,218 --> 00:01:49,550
It's filled now

5
00:01:50,555 --> 00:01:54,184
Why did Papa have to take up a job
with the Indian Embassy?

6
00:01:55,226 --> 00:01:58,662
Every year they have him transferred,
from one embassy to another

7
00:01:59,497 --> 00:02:01,397
This time it is Russia

8
00:02:14,178 --> 00:02:17,147
Know what? The mornings here
are so cold that...

9
00:02:17,582 --> 00:02:20,415
my teeth wrestle with each other

10
00:02:22,186 --> 00:02:25,314
The things we used to eat on our way
to school, back in India!

11
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,487
Nandulal's "kachoris"...

12
00:02:27,858 --> 00:02:29,655
Karim Lala's "falooda"...

13
00:02:29,927 --> 00:02:33,727
In Russia, we find milkshakes,
no faloodas...

14
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:37,163
rosous, no kachoris...

15
00:02:40,004 --> 00:02:43,405
Priya, this city seems to have
no houses at all

16
00:02:44,675 --> 00:02:48,634
And the buildings here
look more like palaces

17
00:02:51,282 --> 00:02:53,580
But looking at the brighter side
of the life...

18
00:02:54,218 --> 00:02:56,186
Now that I'm here...

19
00:02:56,587 --> 00:02:59,181
it seems like a Disney Magical
Adventure city to me

20
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,926
There's a forest on the way...

21
00:03:03,361 --> 00:03:05,795
and a small pond
inside the forest

22
00:03:06,497 --> 00:03:09,694
Every morning, my sister Lucky throws
bread-crumbs at the ducks in the pond

23
00:03:11,235 --> 00:03:14,636
Remember, in India, my sister Lucky
always used to be immersed in...

24
00:03:15,172 --> 00:03:20,633
well, well... her thoughts,
her poems and her books

25
00:03:21,746 --> 00:03:24,146
Here, her plight seems
to have worsened...

26
00:03:24,982 --> 00:03:27,143
now she sings religious hymns too!

27
00:03:27,618 --> 00:03:30,485
My sister Lucky!
Meera in Russia

28
00:03:32,256 --> 00:03:33,382
found it!

29
00:03:34,191 --> 00:03:35,658
Found what?

30
00:03:36,193 --> 00:03:37,421
Lucky

31
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,757
Your name is Lucky.
How come that's Lucky?

32
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,603
Oh no, it's a four-leaf clover.
They say, it brings good luck

33
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:51,767
You mean, it'll help me clear
my examinations?

34
00:03:52,643 --> 00:03:56,306
Sure. But it is effective only once

35
00:03:56,881 --> 00:03:59,850
If I find one like that, I'll pass
the examinations this time...

36
00:04:00,217 --> 00:04:03,118
and give Papa a surprise.
- Then take this one

37
00:04:03,487 --> 00:04:04,454
Really?

38
00:04:06,157 --> 00:04:10,457
I need it more than you do,
because you pass every year

39
00:04:10,828 --> 00:04:12,455
Thank you, sis

40
00:04:13,197 --> 00:04:14,186
Okay... okay

41
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,463
Now shall we...?

42
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:19,135
Why do we've to go
to school every day?

43
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,570
"Priya, there are three Indian girls
in Lucky's class"

44
00:04:30,181 --> 00:04:32,547
"But in my class,
all of them are foreigners"

45
00:04:33,217 --> 00:04:35,481
"I haven't made a single friend yet"

46
00:04:36,387 --> 00:04:38,355
"I miss my India everyday"

47
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,317
Really, I miss India so much

48
00:04:55,272 --> 00:05:00,471
The volkswagen vW PD for motion
as a potent PDI PD130 engine

49
00:05:00,845 --> 00:05:04,110
The ferrari Enzo is a successor
to the f40...

50
00:05:04,782 --> 00:05:06,579
To the f50. Does 0.60...

51
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:09,513
in 2.6 seconds, which makes it
the fastest car in the world

52
00:05:09,854 --> 00:05:12,118
sunaina, you are best.
- Thank you, darling

53
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,618
sunaina, how do I look?
- Like shit!

54
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:19,661
Sunaina, we have a test tomorrow
in school

55
00:05:20,164 --> 00:05:22,655
And what is this that
the two of you are reading?

56
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:28,138
You study for the school test,
while I study for the "cool" test

57
00:05:28,606 --> 00:05:31,575
When he comes, he'll find that
our thoughts match

58
00:05:32,176 --> 00:05:34,144
Who is coming?

59
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,148
Girls, just guess

60
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:40,746
No way

61
00:05:42,186 --> 00:05:43,813
Don't tell me he's coming!

62
00:05:44,188 --> 00:05:46,315
Is it a dream?
- Should I pinch you?

63
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,150
I'll be meeting him
after three years

64
00:05:49,527 --> 00:05:51,495
The last time he came...

65
00:05:51,929 --> 00:05:53,897
he didn't even cast a glance at me

66
00:05:54,532 --> 00:05:56,830
Those dirty braces spoilt my smile

67
00:05:57,568 --> 00:06:00,765
But now...
- smashing seventeen!

68
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,108
I was also a bit plump then

69
00:06:06,343 --> 00:06:07,674
But...

70
00:06:08,145 --> 00:06:09,305
now...

71
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:17,109
This time he'll turn around for sure,
and also admire his new girlfriend

72
00:06:18,155 --> 00:06:20,123
But who is he?
- Hush

73
00:06:20,524 --> 00:06:24,551
When everyone is asleep at night, I'll
quietly dress up and go to meet him

74
00:06:25,396 --> 00:06:28,524
He will be waiting for me!
He'll come for me...

75
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:32,135
and lost in his eyes,
I'll be a little nervous

76
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,137
He'll grab my hand and say,
"come closer"

77
00:06:35,739 --> 00:06:39,140
I'll comply. At some noise,
I'll hug him, out of fright

78
00:06:40,177 --> 00:06:41,735
Ah, someone might see us!

79
00:06:42,179 --> 00:06:44,739
Then he'll bring his lips
closer to mine and say...

80
00:06:45,249 --> 00:06:47,649
"Give me a kiss, honey".
And then...

81
00:06:48,185 --> 00:06:49,675
And then?

82
00:06:50,521 --> 00:06:52,489
You tell me. What would you do?

83
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:57,422
What do I say? I don't even know
who you are talking about

84
00:06:57,728 --> 00:07:00,629
I know what this bore will tell.
What say, Padma?

85
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:06,091
Right. She will say,
"The moon appears so near, no?"

86
00:07:07,137 --> 00:07:13,440
"Know what? The moon is 384404
kilometres away from the earth"

87
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:15,803
"I learnt that in school"

88
00:07:18,148 --> 00:07:19,376
Really?

89
00:07:20,284 --> 00:07:22,252
I'd say something else

90
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:47,477
"Good Lord"

91
00:07:49,179 --> 00:07:51,374
"Oh my God"

92
00:07:53,183 --> 00:07:55,413
"Why is my heart..."

93
00:07:56,987 --> 00:07:59,148
"hysteric?"

94
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:04,094
"Someone will come,
take me in his arms..."

95
00:08:04,562 --> 00:08:07,258
"and kiss my lucky lips"

96
00:09:25,175 --> 00:09:28,110
"I feel ticklish..."

97
00:09:29,146 --> 00:09:32,445
"I'm lost..."

98
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,115
"I'm half-awake, half-asleep"

99
00:09:40,491 --> 00:09:43,790
"It's an entirely all-new feeling"

100
00:09:44,561 --> 00:09:47,587
"A thirst lingers on my lips"

101
00:09:48,165 --> 00:09:50,793
"It's a special sense of pain"

102
00:09:55,939 --> 00:09:57,839
"someone will leave..."

103
00:09:58,308 --> 00:09:59,798
"with a restless feeling..."

104
00:10:00,177 --> 00:10:02,407
"after seeing my lucky lips"

105
00:10:52,229 --> 00:10:55,198
"I'm soaring with the breeze..."

106
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:59,202
"in my obsession"

107
00:10:59,703 --> 00:11:03,469
"My eyes, downcast and coy..."

108
00:11:04,508 --> 00:11:08,308
"my breaths reveal my story"

109
00:11:13,183 --> 00:11:16,619
"My heart thumps wildly..."

110
00:11:17,187 --> 00:11:19,382
"and my lucky lips yearn"

111
00:11:28,265 --> 00:11:30,165
"Good Lord"

112
00:11:32,202 --> 00:11:34,500
"Oh my God"

113
00:11:36,206 --> 00:11:39,175
"Why is my heart..."

114
00:11:39,576 --> 00:11:41,635
"hysteric?"

115
00:11:43,213 --> 00:11:47,172
"Someone will come,
take me in his arms..."

116
00:11:47,618 --> 00:11:49,848
"and kiss my lucky lips"

117
00:12:23,187 --> 00:12:25,155
But who's coming?

118
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:27,557
Adi.
- Adi?

119
00:12:28,192 --> 00:12:29,682
Adi, who?

120
00:12:30,194 --> 00:12:31,821
Ambassador sekhri's son

121
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:33,821
Oh Lucky! He's so dashing...

122
00:12:34,264 --> 00:12:36,789
so charming...
- so manly

123
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:42,336
If he's so dashing and manly, why'd
he be interested in a school girl?

124
00:12:42,606 --> 00:12:46,565
Please! You are just jealous.
Okay?

125
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:50,605
When he comes, just watch
how I floor him

126
00:12:52,316 --> 00:12:53,578
Girls...

127
00:13:00,524 --> 00:13:03,118
sunaina, sorry

128
00:13:05,162 --> 00:13:08,461
sunaina, you won't believe
what blunder I've committed

129
00:13:08,832 --> 00:13:11,130
Now what?
- Tomorrow is the Geography test

130
00:13:11,768 --> 00:13:15,135
And I misread the timetable
and studied history

131
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:21,136
How could you be so foolish?
- I got to study the entire syllabus

132
00:13:21,578 --> 00:13:23,341
The entire syllabus?

133
00:13:24,514 --> 00:13:27,142
Lucky darling, you're going to fail,
I can guarantee that

134
00:13:27,517 --> 00:13:29,348
I'll hang up now, bye

135
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,822
Lucky, they will be singing hymns
all night tomorrow at sunaina's

136
00:13:38,528 --> 00:13:44,160
I don't want you to be looking
like a ghost there

137
00:13:44,902 --> 00:13:48,167
Know what? All the Indians
will be there

138
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:55,178
Listen... I've packed your bag

139
00:13:57,214 --> 00:13:59,512
Lingerie, toothbrush
...I've put everything

140
00:13:59,883 --> 00:14:02,681
Ma, please let me study

141
00:14:03,553 --> 00:14:06,454
Where's Dhara?
- In the bathroom

142
00:14:09,493 --> 00:14:11,791
I don't know what to do
with this girl!

143
00:14:12,963 --> 00:14:16,296
If she flunks this time,
your papa will be really angry

144
00:14:17,701 --> 00:14:19,794
Besides, he's so hassled these days

145
00:14:21,171 --> 00:14:23,867
Why? What happened to Papa?

146
00:14:24,508 --> 00:14:25,805
Nothing

147
00:14:27,444 --> 00:14:30,242
said, there's some official problem

148
00:14:31,248 --> 00:14:34,547
People are on the streets,
rioting

149
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,154
Anyway, we've nothing to do with it

150
00:14:41,858 --> 00:14:44,156
Here... your bag is packed

151
00:14:47,631 --> 00:14:50,156
Dhara, make it fast!
- Two minutes, Ma

152
00:14:51,268 --> 00:14:56,171
Lucky, sleep for a while, dear.
Get up early in the morning and study

153
00:14:57,207 --> 00:14:58,174
Mom

154
00:14:59,977 --> 00:15:03,469
Go to sleep, dear,
or you will fall sick

155
00:15:32,175 --> 00:15:34,803
It's seven!
Why didn't the alarm buzz?

156
00:15:36,446 --> 00:15:38,471
Get up, Dhara!

157
00:15:39,516 --> 00:15:41,609
Let me sleep, sis.
It's only 2

158
00:15:42,219 --> 00:15:44,346
It's 7! Get up, quick

159
00:15:45,522 --> 00:15:49,424
No good waking up,
I'm going to flunk anyway

160
00:15:55,665 --> 00:15:56,825
Get up!

161
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,498
Hush, sis! Someone is sleeping here

162
00:16:03,807 --> 00:16:05,672
c'mon get up, you dumbo!

163
00:16:09,146 --> 00:16:10,443
Stop it, sis

164
00:16:31,635 --> 00:16:33,603
Bye, Dhara.
- Papa's on the line, Lucky

165
00:16:36,173 --> 00:16:37,401
I love you

166
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:43,479
Good morning, dear.
Prepared to come first, aren't you?

167
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:46,149
Papa...
- What happened?

168
00:16:46,616 --> 00:16:48,743
Mr Negi...
- Hang on, dear. Yes, sir

169
00:16:49,186 --> 00:16:50,881
My son Aditya is arriving
from Paris today

170
00:16:51,288 --> 00:16:55,816
His car's number is 0267 xP78. Please
see he has no problems with security

171
00:16:56,193 --> 00:16:57,820
sure.
- I'll be busy in a meeting

172
00:16:58,195 --> 00:17:00,163
That's why I can't receive him

173
00:17:01,131 --> 00:17:03,099
He's not coming by flight, sir?

174
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,098
He can dump his father,
but not his car

175
00:17:06,503 --> 00:17:09,097
Wherever he goes, he goes in his car.
He's driving down

176
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:10,636
Okay, sir

177
00:17:11,575 --> 00:17:13,600
Yes, dear.
- Yes, papa

178
00:17:14,144 --> 00:17:17,113
Best of luck, dear. I'm sure
you'll come first this time too

179
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:18,709
Bye, dear

180
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,119
Please help me. Please, God!

181
00:17:26,156 --> 00:17:30,718
Perform a miracle, Lord!
Let the exams be postponed

182
00:17:37,934 --> 00:17:39,902
I'm sure you will come first, dear

183
00:17:40,704 --> 00:17:42,296
first... first... first

184
00:17:42,572 --> 00:17:45,336
Papa is too much.
I'm only human

185
00:17:46,243 --> 00:17:48,143
so what if I fail once?

186
00:17:54,184 --> 00:17:57,483
I'm forgetting all that I studied

187
00:18:06,396 --> 00:18:07,590
Oh, God!

188
00:18:09,366 --> 00:18:12,767
A flat tyre! Now!
I won't have time to study now

189
00:18:30,487 --> 00:18:31,454
Hey

190
00:18:32,222 --> 00:18:33,120
Hi

191
00:18:35,225 --> 00:18:36,658
No Russian

192
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,257
English?

193
00:18:39,162 --> 00:18:40,652
Flat tyre?

194
00:18:42,265 --> 00:18:44,130
Help?
- No. It's okay

195
00:18:44,501 --> 00:18:46,128
No... no. Wait

196
00:18:47,504 --> 00:18:48,471
Wait

197
00:18:58,181 --> 00:19:00,149
No school today?

198
00:19:07,123 --> 00:19:09,091
I'll fix it.
- No

199
00:19:42,158 --> 00:19:43,318
My cycle?

200
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,891
Rest?

201
00:19:50,867 --> 00:19:52,300
Vice caption

202
00:19:57,173 --> 00:19:58,697
Just leave me.
No!

203
00:20:02,245 --> 00:20:05,703
No! No leave me

204
00:20:08,184 --> 00:20:09,151
Help!

205
00:21:52,689 --> 00:21:54,179
Thief

206
00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:37,226
Good morning

207
00:23:44,801 --> 00:23:46,769
I'm giving you. You aren't
missing your flight, are you?

208
00:24:02,552 --> 00:24:03,780
Thank you

209
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:28,802
Yeah! Nothing.
- Sure

210
00:24:30,513 --> 00:24:32,140
Nothing

211
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:34,308
check

212
00:24:45,194 --> 00:24:47,162
What the hell you are doing
in my car? No English?

213
00:24:47,463 --> 00:24:48,896
What are you doing in my car?

214
00:24:57,307 --> 00:24:58,774
Hang on, brother

215
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:01,768
Miss? School bus miss?

216
00:25:04,147 --> 00:25:08,516
No Russian, no spanish,
no Hindi

217
00:25:08,885 --> 00:25:10,409
I'm screwed

218
00:25:16,926 --> 00:25:18,723
I know Hindi

219
00:25:22,265 --> 00:25:23,232
Indian?

220
00:25:28,838 --> 00:25:30,669
Indian passport please?

221
00:25:33,176 --> 00:25:34,370
No passport?

222
00:26:27,764 --> 00:26:28,788
Watch out

223
00:27:58,721 --> 00:28:00,621
stay inside, I'll be back

224
00:28:05,128 --> 00:28:07,096
c'mon wake up.
C'mon get up

225
00:28:08,131 --> 00:28:09,098
c'mon

226
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:11,430
Drive. You drive

227
00:28:12,468 --> 00:28:14,299
What are you doing? Drive

228
00:28:17,673 --> 00:28:19,368
What the...? Drive

229
00:28:19,609 --> 00:28:20,576
Drive!

230
00:28:20,843 --> 00:28:21,810
Drive!

231
00:28:26,649 --> 00:28:27,616
Stop!

232
00:28:28,151 --> 00:28:29,778
Stop! Hey, stop!

233
00:28:55,178 --> 00:28:57,544
Bullets flying
through such huge guns...

234
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,141
an elephant-like tank speeds
towards my car...

235
00:29:00,416 --> 00:29:03,476
and I blast my tonsils screaming, but
it hardly makes any difference to you

236
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,578
Drive!

237
00:29:07,123 --> 00:29:08,090
Drive!

238
00:29:09,158 --> 00:29:11,786
Drive! I say, drive!

239
00:29:13,296 --> 00:29:15,264
What were you thinking of?

240
00:29:17,133 --> 00:29:18,293
What?

241
00:29:19,135 --> 00:29:21,103
I can't drive

242
00:29:42,158 --> 00:29:44,786
Oh God! Take care of Adi

243
00:29:53,202 --> 00:29:54,169
sir

244
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:57,364
All the phone lines are dead.
Only one choice left

245
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,808
I'll go with the security squadron
to search for Adi

246
00:30:00,243 --> 00:30:01,471
No

247
00:30:02,545 --> 00:30:04,513
Unless...

248
00:30:06,182 --> 00:30:08,480
I get an assessment on the situation
in the city...

249
00:30:08,851 --> 00:30:11,479
I won't allow anyone to step out
of the embassy

250
00:30:14,357 --> 00:30:17,520
Before the communication lines
jammed, we taped the BBc broadcast

251
00:30:18,194 --> 00:30:20,162
There's no news
on the situation otherwise

252
00:30:20,496 --> 00:30:22,726
Play it quickly.
- Mr Negi...

253
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,501
This is terrible

254
00:30:30,206 --> 00:30:33,835
The terrorists have started attacking
in the open. Now what, sir?

255
00:30:34,944 --> 00:30:36,912
Where's the President? Any news?
- No, sir

256
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:39,844
We hear, ministers have
been kidnapped

257
00:30:40,483 --> 00:30:44,249
The army is working out a strategy to
tackle the terrorists. War is brewing

258
00:30:45,288 --> 00:30:46,846
Oh my God!

259
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:52,994
I hope my Adi is safe and all right

260
00:31:13,249 --> 00:31:17,811
It's a graveyard.
- Hey school girl, come in front

261
00:31:19,221 --> 00:31:21,485
I might look like one,
but I'm not your chauffeur

262
00:31:23,526 --> 00:31:27,587
I know it's a graveyard. But,
you know what's special about it?

263
00:31:28,197 --> 00:31:32,156
We are three feet
above the ground now

264
00:31:32,568 --> 00:31:35,537
If we drive further,
we'll come back right here

265
00:31:36,205 --> 00:31:38,173
But then...

266
00:31:38,874 --> 00:31:41,604
we'll be six feet under the ground

267
00:31:42,211 --> 00:31:45,647
Then you won't be asking questions
and I won't be answering any

268
00:31:46,315 --> 00:31:51,184
Now let me find out what problems
those people fighting out there have

269
00:32:09,171 --> 00:32:12,800
It's got old. Would you please
open that door?

270
00:32:15,845 --> 00:32:17,142
Hang on

271
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,371
Before you break it, let me try

272
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:24,148
Well, what's the name of the girl
who's sitting in my car?

273
00:32:25,187 --> 00:32:26,814
My name is Lucky

274
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,155
I'm sorry.
Are you hurt?

275
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,157
What were you saying?
- I said, my name is Lucky

276
00:32:34,363 --> 00:32:36,695
Pardon...? Lucky?

277
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:48,540
Listen... seriously, are you Lucky?

278
00:32:49,879 --> 00:32:51,346
Lucky Negi

279
00:32:55,251 --> 00:32:59,585
Hear that? The girl with whom I've
spent the luckiest day of my life...

280
00:33:00,022 --> 00:33:02,115
happens to be Lucky Negi

281
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:05,127
How will I reach home?

282
00:33:08,164 --> 00:33:11,292
I will reach you home... wouldn't you
like to know my name?

283
00:33:15,171 --> 00:33:17,139
I'm Aditya sekhri

284
00:33:23,179 --> 00:33:24,646
shake hands

285
00:33:26,382 --> 00:33:29,818
Don't worry, I'm not going to accept
that hand forever

286
00:33:32,521 --> 00:33:33,488
Good

287
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,154
Now how about getting down to work?
- Work?

288
00:33:37,726 --> 00:33:39,694
Yes.
- What work?

289
00:33:41,564 --> 00:33:43,532
You want to go home, don't you?

290
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,691
And your mummy isn't coming here
to fix the radio

291
00:33:47,536 --> 00:33:49,834
so we got to do something.
Let's start?

292
00:33:50,706 --> 00:33:51,832
Come

293
00:33:53,342 --> 00:33:56,778
There are about 3000 Indians in this
area. And it is our prime duty...

294
00:33:57,213 --> 00:33:58,840
to protect all of them
- Mr sinha

295
00:33:59,248 --> 00:34:01,443
sir, we've begun the task
of bringing them to the embassy

296
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:05,117
Good. Any problems on the way?
- No, sir

297
00:34:05,488 --> 00:34:08,457
No harm yet to the vehicles
carrying the Indian tricolour

298
00:34:08,824 --> 00:34:10,689
That's very good.
Let's hope that it stays like that

299
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,650
Excuse me, sir

300
00:34:13,162 --> 00:34:15,460
Your wife wants to see you.
It's urgent

301
00:34:15,931 --> 00:34:18,399
I'm busy. Tell her, I'll see her
in ten minutes

302
00:34:18,701 --> 00:34:19,668
Okay, sir

303
00:34:20,236 --> 00:34:23,330
Lucky...
- What happened to Lucky?

304
00:34:24,206 --> 00:34:26,470
Lucky hasn't returned
from school yet

305
00:34:26,775 --> 00:34:27,742
Anjali!

306
00:34:31,247 --> 00:34:32,714
Right... right

307
00:34:33,382 --> 00:34:36,476
No! Left

308
00:34:37,186 --> 00:34:39,154
Left... left

309
00:34:39,555 --> 00:34:40,522
Right

310
00:34:40,856 --> 00:34:42,653
I mean, the left was right

311
00:34:44,226 --> 00:34:45,659
stay put

312
00:34:56,605 --> 00:34:57,833
What news?

313
00:34:58,374 --> 00:34:59,966
Stay there, I'll tell you

314
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:03,105
Look Ms Lucky...

315
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,612
see this... we are in Russia

316
00:35:09,585 --> 00:35:13,282
There's a clash between the government
and the terrorists

317
00:35:15,324 --> 00:35:18,657
What all areas are under attack?
- We are here

318
00:35:19,261 --> 00:35:23,664
They are fighting here, here,
here... everywhere

319
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:26,634
Adi...
- Yes?

320
00:35:27,169 --> 00:35:29,137
A bee.
- Kill it, or it'll sting you.

321
00:35:29,338 --> 00:35:31,306
It'll hurt.
- Kill it!

322
00:35:35,177 --> 00:35:37,145
Are you a fool?
What is with you?

323
00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:43,147
Damn these school girls!

324
00:36:04,173 --> 00:36:07,631
I know, I was harsh.
Okay, I'm going

325
00:36:08,143 --> 00:36:10,111
c'mon, I'm going!

326
00:36:45,848 --> 00:36:47,475
How sweet!

327
00:36:48,183 --> 00:36:51,619
I'm hurt, but it is you
who is crying

328
00:36:53,555 --> 00:36:56,615
Did you meet your boyfriend
when you were crying?

329
00:36:57,192 --> 00:36:58,819
I don't have a boyfriend

330
00:36:59,261 --> 00:37:01,161
Really? You're lying

331
00:37:02,197 --> 00:37:05,530
All right, if you don't have
a boyfriend, would you tell me...

332
00:37:06,135 --> 00:37:08,433
who gave you these "hicci"?

333
00:37:09,138 --> 00:37:12,767
Hiccups?
- Not hiccups, "hicci"

334
00:37:15,144 --> 00:37:17,112
Know what a love-bite is?

335
00:37:18,147 --> 00:37:24,108
Strange. When I was in school
we used to call love-bites "hicci"

336
00:37:25,654 --> 00:37:30,114
I don't know what they're called
these days. Whatever, but I'm sure...

337
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:34,520
your boyfriend gave you that.
- I don't have a boyfriend

338
00:37:35,164 --> 00:37:38,133
And may God never give me one!

339
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:44,300
I just asked God for a miracle,
because I didn't want to fail the exam

340
00:37:46,175 --> 00:37:51,135
But then, my bicycle's tyre went flat,
and then I met that filthy man...

341
00:37:52,181 --> 00:37:56,140
who told me he'd fix my tyre.
But he tugged at my hair...

342
00:37:57,186 --> 00:37:59,154
Tugged at your hair?
Why didn't you hit him?

343
00:37:59,588 --> 00:38:01,488
I did?
- How?

344
00:38:02,124 --> 00:38:04,092
With my lunch box

345
00:38:07,129 --> 00:38:08,756
very good, Lucky

346
00:38:09,398 --> 00:38:13,698
Tell me... how did you
get into my car?

347
00:38:14,803 --> 00:38:18,432
The door was locked.
- Right. How did you unlock it?

348
00:38:19,141 --> 00:38:21,439
I tried using the cutter

349
00:38:22,611 --> 00:38:25,375
cutter? You keep a cutter
with you, eh?

350
00:38:25,681 --> 00:38:27,114
Paper cutter

351
00:38:31,153 --> 00:38:34,122
And it unlocked?
- No

352
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:37,118
Then?
- I used the compass

353
00:38:39,528 --> 00:38:41,587
And it gave in?
- No

354
00:38:43,232 --> 00:38:46,633
I got it. Then you shoved the compass
as well as the divider...

355
00:38:47,169 --> 00:38:50,502
into the lock and broke it. Right?
- Right

356
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:54,600
But it took all my strength

357
00:38:57,312 --> 00:39:00,406
Had you waited two more minutes,
I'd have come and rescued you

358
00:39:02,117 --> 00:39:03,516
I don't have...

359
00:39:04,787 --> 00:39:07,585
Pardon...? If you could talk
a little louder...

360
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:11,489
a normal man like me
would hear you

361
00:39:12,795 --> 00:39:16,492
I don't have a boyfriend.
I'm not those types

362
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:19,698
Please believe me

363
00:39:27,209 --> 00:39:29,439
I've heard that several times before

364
00:39:37,152 --> 00:39:39,450
But I believe you

365
00:39:41,356 --> 00:39:42,618
Let's go

366
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,621
shall we...?

367
00:39:47,863 --> 00:39:53,130
Adi, are we going home?
- We'll have to take the same way back

368
00:39:53,502 --> 00:39:57,131
And you know the situation.
Dead phones, dead radio...

369
00:39:57,539 --> 00:39:59,803
Do you have grandparents?
- No, they are dead

370
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:02,743
Would you like to meet them?
You wouldn't, right?

371
00:40:03,245 --> 00:40:05,145
So we'll have to stay here

372
00:40:06,915 --> 00:40:08,746
Thank you.
- What for?

373
00:40:09,184 --> 00:40:11,152
I saw you thrash him

374
00:40:13,188 --> 00:40:14,485
Tell me...

375
00:40:15,257 --> 00:40:18,818
was that lunch box empty? Or full?

376
00:40:19,895 --> 00:40:21,829
Actually, I couldn't
reach school, so...

377
00:40:22,197 --> 00:40:27,157
What's this?
A hotel inside a school bag!

378
00:40:27,569 --> 00:40:29,764
Come here... I'm famished

379
00:40:30,205 --> 00:40:31,763
This way, please

380
00:40:33,575 --> 00:40:36,567
Official sources say that,
as of now...

381
00:40:36,945 --> 00:40:40,506
the fight between the government and
the rebels has come to a stop

382
00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:46,877
Indefinite curfew has been imposed
in the central city and the suburbs

383
00:40:47,923 --> 00:40:51,188
citizens are requested
not to step out of their houses

384
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:55,456
Wonderful!

385
00:40:56,298 --> 00:40:59,199
Thank God I don't eat such food
everyday. Because if I did...

386
00:40:59,568 --> 00:41:02,128
I'd not be like this,
I'd be a fatso

387
00:41:03,171 --> 00:41:04,798
Your mother cooked it, right?

388
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:07,741
Ask me how I know

389
00:41:08,243 --> 00:41:12,304
How?
- Because every mummy cooks yummy food

390
00:41:13,181 --> 00:41:17,584
Won't you eat?
- I hope they won't mind

391
00:41:18,186 --> 00:41:19,813
They? Who?

392
00:41:21,189 --> 00:41:22,417
They

393
00:41:23,258 --> 00:41:25,158
They? Who?
- They

394
00:41:26,395 --> 00:41:28,363
Who? Who's here?

395
00:41:29,197 --> 00:41:32,564
I mean, we're sitting on a grave
with food...

396
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,501
it feels bad

397
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,167
I see. One second

398
00:41:42,678 --> 00:41:44,509
Peter. 1903

399
00:41:45,213 --> 00:41:48,182
The poor guy has been sleeping here
since 1903

400
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:52,611
He himself doesn't know when he died.
I don't think he'll get up...

401
00:41:53,221 --> 00:41:56,657
and say, "Hello. I'm Peter.
When I was alive..."

402
00:41:57,225 --> 00:41:59,523
"my favourite dish used to be
Indian. Potato pancakes"

403
00:42:02,631 --> 00:42:07,125
still, if you insist,
I'll invite him for dinner. Okay?

404
00:42:08,937 --> 00:42:12,134
Peter, I'm Aditya sekhri.
And she is Lucky Negi

405
00:42:13,175 --> 00:42:15,803
Nice to meet you.
We want you to dine with us

406
00:42:16,545 --> 00:42:19,139
The food will be great, guaranteed

407
00:42:19,548 --> 00:42:22,142
If you still have those fingers,
you will chew them up too

408
00:42:23,185 --> 00:42:25,483
Because the food comes
from Lucky Inn

409
00:42:25,854 --> 00:42:27,822
chicken, or potatoes,
pizza or bread...

410
00:42:28,256 --> 00:42:31,157
you're welcome to Lucky Inn,
even if you are dead

411
00:42:37,899 --> 00:42:39,867
I'm to funny

412
00:42:41,269 --> 00:42:45,603
Well? Wasn't I funny...?
I think I wasn't

413
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:49,177
Well, I'm thirsty. I'll get water
from the jeep

414
00:42:49,611 --> 00:42:52,171
No, I have water here.
No need to go anywhere

415
00:42:52,547 --> 00:42:54,515
so hurry up

416
00:42:55,017 --> 00:42:56,712
One minute...

417
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:06,427
Not water, it's only a sip of water

418
00:43:07,162 --> 00:43:09,392
Give it back if you don't want.
- I'm drinking

419
00:43:14,236 --> 00:43:17,137
Looks like you'll have to spend
the night with me. Know what?

420
00:43:17,506 --> 00:43:20,566
Girls would do anything
for such an opportunity

421
00:43:21,843 --> 00:43:23,811
I know. The girls in my school...

422
00:43:24,179 --> 00:43:26,807
are willing to do anything
for this opportunity

423
00:43:27,983 --> 00:43:30,645
The girls in your school
are still talking about me?

424
00:43:32,954 --> 00:43:36,617
Not bad!
I'm not history yet!

425
00:43:40,262 --> 00:43:42,628
Look, I belong to a well to do
family, so the front seat is mine

426
00:43:43,198 --> 00:43:47,157
You take the backseat.
And here's your blanket

427
00:44:13,161 --> 00:44:17,530
What happened, Lucky? Why are you
making noises under the blanket?

428
00:44:23,505 --> 00:44:26,133
I've never spent a night
away from home

429
00:44:28,176 --> 00:44:29,803
I'm scared

430
00:44:32,848 --> 00:44:36,477
If it's because you are spending
the night with me...

431
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:39,487
don't be afraid at all

432
00:44:41,623 --> 00:44:43,591
Because I'm not those types

433
00:44:46,628 --> 00:44:48,152
Trust me

434
00:44:50,899 --> 00:44:52,161
Adi...

435
00:44:54,336 --> 00:44:56,304
I trust you

436
00:44:59,541 --> 00:45:01,600
Thank you, Ms Lucky Negi

437
00:45:03,912 --> 00:45:05,709
Go to sleep

438
00:45:33,241 --> 00:45:36,802
"come and hold me in your arms..."

439
00:45:37,846 --> 00:45:40,144
"I implore you"

440
00:45:40,549 --> 00:45:44,815
"I'm dying, my love"

441
00:45:55,263 --> 00:45:59,632
"come and take me in your arms..."

442
00:46:00,202 --> 00:46:02,432
"for my sake"

443
00:46:02,871 --> 00:46:07,103
"I'm dying, my love"

444
00:46:17,485 --> 00:46:20,579
"come and take me in your arms..."

445
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:24,124
"for my sake"

446
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:30,122
"I'm dying, my love"

447
00:47:01,229 --> 00:47:03,424
"Love is amazing"

448
00:47:05,133 --> 00:47:07,431
"Wonderful things, my eyes behold"

449
00:47:08,503 --> 00:47:12,098
"Until yesterday
my heart was mine..."

450
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,102
"now it belongs to you"

451
00:47:16,144 --> 00:47:18,374
"An unusual desire..."

452
00:47:19,648 --> 00:47:21,775
"appeals"

453
00:47:23,418 --> 00:47:26,649
"I've spent every moment..."

454
00:47:27,155 --> 00:47:29,453
"suffering in pain"

455
00:47:30,825 --> 00:47:32,793
"Look..."

456
00:47:34,229 --> 00:47:38,131
"look, don't..."

457
00:47:38,833 --> 00:47:41,131
"torment me anymore"

458
00:47:41,536 --> 00:47:46,132
"I'm dying, my love"

459
00:48:11,132 --> 00:48:13,430
"Alluring naivete"

460
00:48:14,803 --> 00:48:16,771
"Amazing intoxication"

461
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,670
"To you..."

462
00:48:21,142 --> 00:48:24,578
"I now give my life"

463
00:48:25,814 --> 00:48:28,112
"Amazing reality"

464
00:48:29,451 --> 00:48:31,851
"What a story"

465
00:48:33,154 --> 00:48:35,645
"Beside me..."

466
00:48:36,157 --> 00:48:39,456
"stands the princess of my dreams"

467
00:48:40,295 --> 00:48:41,819
"No more..."

468
00:48:44,165 --> 00:48:47,566
"no more can I bear..."

469
00:48:48,503 --> 00:48:50,801
"this grief of separation"

470
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:55,537
"I'm dying, my love"

471
00:48:58,847 --> 00:49:02,749
"I'm dying, my love"

472
00:49:29,878 --> 00:49:32,369
Betrayal! D'you intend to
elope with Peter?

473
00:49:32,847 --> 00:49:35,111
Look Lucky, please don't do this

474
00:49:35,617 --> 00:49:38,586
I can't live without you.
I'll die without you!

475
00:49:39,421 --> 00:49:44,188
I beg of you, please don't dump me

476
00:49:49,431 --> 00:49:54,130
Now stop dreaming about Peter,
it's too late in the night

477
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:58,139
come and sleep, Ms Lucky Negi

478
00:50:07,182 --> 00:50:09,548
But sir, who's this man?

479
00:50:11,186 --> 00:50:13,814
Should be coming any moment.
See for yourself

480
00:50:15,523 --> 00:50:19,152
Only this person can find
Adi and Lucky

481
00:50:19,527 --> 00:50:21,495
Greetings.
- Greetings

482
00:50:21,863 --> 00:50:23,831
Any news of Lucky?

483
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,167
Anjali...

484
00:50:54,596 --> 00:50:59,966
Hello, hi... no need
for such formalities

485
00:51:02,604 --> 00:51:05,129
If I am not mistaken,
you are the girl's father

486
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,733
Right... but how do you know?

487
00:51:08,176 --> 00:51:10,144
That dejected look...

488
00:51:10,845 --> 00:51:13,143
and those dried up tears...

489
00:51:13,615 --> 00:51:16,413
under your eyes
reveal your identity

490
00:51:22,724 --> 00:51:25,921
Handkerchief... wipe off those
tears and distress

491
00:51:27,195 --> 00:51:34,829
A great man said, "Tears are nothing
but salty water. Wipe them off"

492
00:51:38,606 --> 00:51:41,336
No Mr Negi, I'm not mad

493
00:51:43,945 --> 00:51:47,540
And you can confirm that
with the Ambassador

494
00:51:50,718 --> 00:51:54,882
My hand... four fingers and a thumb

495
00:51:56,925 --> 00:52:03,831
Kidnapping, robbery, bribery,
rape and murder

496
00:52:06,668 --> 00:52:10,126
I've spent 17 years with
the Intelligence service

497
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:13,807
I've come across all kinds
of criminals

498
00:52:17,245 --> 00:52:21,477
clench the fist...

499
00:52:23,184 --> 00:52:31,148
and there's no criminal activity

500
00:52:37,198 --> 00:52:41,157
Pindi Das Kapoor's fist
has never opened...

501
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:44,438
nor can anyone open it

502
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:49,608
sir.
- I trust you completely

503
00:52:51,279 --> 00:52:53,839
These are the pictures
of Aditya and Lucky

504
00:52:55,216 --> 00:52:59,744
They are missing.
And we fear they might have...

505
00:53:00,221 --> 00:53:01,449
fear?

506
00:53:03,191 --> 00:53:08,458
What for? As long as a person
is missing, he is alive

507
00:53:11,666 --> 00:53:16,797
If this can relieve you a bit,
then let me tell you that...

508
00:53:18,172 --> 00:53:22,575
your daughter's bicycle has been
found, in the forest near the school

509
00:53:23,244 --> 00:53:25,804
And Lucky? Any news of her?

510
00:53:32,186 --> 00:53:34,154
Belongs to her

511
00:53:47,602 --> 00:53:49,160
A great man once said...

512
00:53:50,338 --> 00:53:52,898
"No boundary, no power on earth
can stop me..."

513
00:53:53,941 --> 00:53:56,171
"from uniting a mother
and her daughter"

514
00:54:53,668 --> 00:54:55,636
Ms Lucky, tell me something

515
00:54:57,538 --> 00:55:01,099
Did you have a premonition
of the war? You are fully prepared

516
00:55:02,877 --> 00:55:07,109
I hope you aren't a KGB agent?
- I was going to stay at sunaina's

517
00:55:07,315 --> 00:55:09,283
That's why I had packed my bags

518
00:55:10,885 --> 00:55:12,853
sunaina? Who?

519
00:55:14,756 --> 00:55:17,623
Oh yes. Sunaina. How's she?

520
00:55:18,593 --> 00:55:20,117
It's been long since we met

521
00:55:21,162 --> 00:55:23,130
As kids, we used to play together

522
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:30,894
I'm hungry

523
00:55:31,639 --> 00:55:35,131
Last night I told you to eat,
but you were worried about ghosts

524
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:48,154
Wonderful

525
00:55:50,525 --> 00:55:52,493
Hi! I'm Aditya sekhri.

526
00:55:53,261 --> 00:55:55,491
And you?
- I'm Lucky Negi

527
00:55:57,532 --> 00:56:00,592
strange. Last night too
I met one Lucky Negi

528
00:56:01,269 --> 00:56:03,100
But she wasn't like you one bit

529
00:56:03,805 --> 00:56:06,103
Do you know her?
- I used to

530
00:56:07,275 --> 00:56:09,106
History, eh?

531
00:56:09,677 --> 00:56:13,113
You forgot her so fast.
Would you forget me too?

532
00:56:16,684 --> 00:56:20,620
Hello, no need to get ideas.
I was only joking

533
00:56:21,289 --> 00:56:23,120
Let me go and arrange
some food for you

534
00:56:24,826 --> 00:56:26,453
I know

535
00:56:29,664 --> 00:56:33,122
What's that for?
- To pluck apples

536
00:56:33,868 --> 00:56:36,632
I'm going with you.
- No. Stay here...

537
00:56:37,638 --> 00:56:39,606
and take care of my Queen Tullu

538
00:56:40,608 --> 00:56:42,872
Who will come here?
- Anyone

539
00:56:43,845 --> 00:56:46,143
Who?
- Anyone

540
00:56:46,514 --> 00:56:48,311
Look that way.
- Why?

541
00:56:48,716 --> 00:56:50,479
Turn around!

542
00:56:51,352 --> 00:56:53,650
I feel shy, I need to
take my underwear

543
00:56:55,323 --> 00:56:56,483
c'mon

544
00:56:57,892 --> 00:56:59,655
Today's school girls!

545
00:57:02,597 --> 00:57:05,088
Done. And, also clean my car
