1
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:23,601
(SINGING) You must do
your best tonight
Be on your toes, men

2
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,896
There's another
guest tonight
It's one of those men

3
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,066
Who are being feted
by the smart set.

4
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,277
ALL: We'll see that he gets
what he deserves

5
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:36,697
Treat him as they do
a king in manner royal

6
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:40,034
Like a subject to a king
you must be loyal

7
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:43,329
On this object
you must have
your heart set

8
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,123
ALL: We'll do nothing
to get on his nerves

9
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,460
Again I mention
Be on your toes, men

10
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:52,588
He craves attention
He's one of those men

11
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,716
ALL: Yes, sir,
we will give him
just what he deserves

12
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,689
Oh, Hives?
Oh, yes,
Mrs. Rittenhouse?

13
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:12,108
I'd like to make
a few changes in the
assignment of the rooms.

14
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,192
Very good, madam.

15
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:16,028
Suppose you put
Mr. Chandler in
the blue suite.

16
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,864
And Captain Spaulding,
as guest of honor,

17
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:20,491
will have
the green duplex
with the two baths.

18
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:21,659
Two, madam?

19
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,785
Why, yes.

20
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,080
I think the Captain
would like two baths,
don't you?

21
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:30,251
Well, if he's just
returned from Africa,
he may need two baths.

22
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,629
MAN: Mr. Roscoe W. Chandler.

23
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,425
Mrs. Rittenhouse,
well!

24
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,137
Mr. Chandler.

25
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,347
So nice
to see you.

26
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,100
The famous Beaugard,
as I have promised.

27
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:49,145
Mr. Chandler, how
can I ever express
my gratitude?

28
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,814
Oh, it's nothing.
Nothing?

29
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:56,527
You return from Europe
with a masterpiece
valued at $100,000,

30
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:58,863
and instead of
displaying it yourself,

31
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,617
you allow me to unveil it
at my party in honor of
Captain Spaulding.

32
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,368
You call
that nothing?

33
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,287
Mrs. Rittenhouse,
I...

34
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,540
Uh, will you please
remove that to the place

35
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:10,750
where it is
to be exhibited?

36
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:14,003
Very good, sir.
And uh,
very careful, please.

37
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:17,214
Mrs. Rittenhouse,
you think
that is something?

38
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,676
It is nothing compared
to what I would
like to do for you.

39
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,304
You are a very
beautiful woman.

40
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,473
No, no,
Mr. Chandler.

41
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,391
Well, maybe I'm wrong.

42
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,101
What?

43
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,021
Please, do not go,
Mrs. Rittenhouse,

44
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,564
I love you.
I know, but...

45
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,816
Do not take away your hand.
I tell you, I love you.

46
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,860
Careful...
Hello, Mother.

47
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,445
Playing house?

48
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,990
Well, uh,
if you'll pardon me.

49
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,242
Have you seen
Johnny Parker?

50
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,411
I wish you'd get
Johnny Parker
out of your mind

51
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,789
and show more respect
to Mr. Chandler.

52
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:53,459
The trouble with you is
you don't take these
social affairs seriously.

53
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,587
What would you
suggest, Mom? Suicide?

54
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:59,924
I would suggest...
(CAR HORN HONKING)

55

Mrs. Rittenhouse,
Captain Spaulding
has arrived!

56
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:06,347
Splendid.
Oh, I'm so glad.

57
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,392
My friends,
Captain Spaulding
has arrived.

ALL: (SINGING)
At last we are to meet him
The famous Captain Spaulding

From climates hot
and scalding
The Captain has arrived

60
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,986
Most heartily we'll greet him
with plain and fancy cheering

61
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,489
Until he's hard of hearing
The Captain has arrived

62
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,617
At last the Captain

63
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:32,498
Has arrived

64
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,334
Mr. Horatio W. Jamison,

65
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:38,045
field secretary
to Captain Spaulding.

66
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,348
(SINGING) I represent
the Captain who insists
on my informing you

67
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:52,351
Of these conditions
under which
he camps here

68
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:55,980
In one thing he is
very strict he wants
his women young and thin

69
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,233
And as for men,
he won't have
any tramps here

70
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,153
ALL: And as for men,
he won't have
any tramps here

71
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:05,406
There must be no tramps

72
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:09,035
The men must all be
very old the women warm,
the champagne cold

73
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,079
It's under these conditions
that he camps here

74
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,000
MAN: I'm announcing
Captain Geoffrey Spaulding

75

00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,965
Oh, dear, he is coming

77
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:27,428

00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,038
Well, what
do I owe you?

80

(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

81
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:00,503
What? From Africa
to here, $1.85?
That's an outrage.

82
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,047
I told you not to
take me through Australia.
You know it's all ripped up.

83
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,340
You should have
come right up
Lincoln Boulevard.

84
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,549
Where do you come
to that stuff?

85
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,510
Turn around the rear end,
I wanna see your
license plates.

86
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,345
I don't think,
you're on the square.
Oh, Captain Spaulding.

87
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,722
I'll attend
to you later.
Oh, Captain Spaulding.

88
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:14,100
Why you're one of
the most beautiful
women I've ever seen.

89
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:16,727
That's not saying
much for you.
Captain Spaulding,

90
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:18,979
Rittenhouse Manor
is entirely
at your disposal.

91
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:23,484
Well, I'm certainly grateful
for this magnificent washout.
Uh, "turnout," and uh,

92
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,277
now I'd like
to say a few words.

93
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:28,280
(SINGING) Hello
I must be going

94
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:31,450
I cannot stay,
I came to say
I must be going

95
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:35,788
I'm glad I came,
but just the same
I must be going... La la

96
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,832
For my sake
you must stay

97
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:42,545
If you should go away
you'd spoil this party
I am throwing

98
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,547
I'll stay a week or two

99
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,174
I'll stay
the summer through

100
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:50,052
But I am telling you

101
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:54,098
I must be going.

102
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,810
ALL: Before you go
will you oblige us

103
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:01,856
And tell us of
your deeds so glowing

104
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,817
I'll do anything you say
In fact, I'll even stay

105
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:05,943
ALL: Good

106
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:11,198
But I must be going

107
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,619
There's something
that I'd like to say

108
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,746
That he's too modest
to relate

109
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:21,375
The Captain is a moral man
Sometimes he finds it trying

110
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,460
This fact I'll emphasize
with stress

111
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,629
I never take a drink unless

112
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,214
Somebody's buying

113
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,800
ALL: The Captain
is a very moral man

114
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:33,679
If he hears anything obscene
he'll naturally repel it

115
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,764
I hate a dirty joke
I do

116
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:40,436
Unless it's told by someone
who knows how to tell it

117
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,606
ALL: The Captain
is a very moral man

118

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,243
He went into the jungles
where all the monkeys
throw nuts

122
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:57,828
If I stay here
I'll go nuts

123
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:00,122
ALL: Hooray, hooray, hooray

124
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,878
He put all his reliance
in courage and defiance

125
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,421
And risked his life
for science

126
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,964
Hey, hey

Well, somebody's
got to do it!
Captain Spaulding?

150
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,590
It is indeed a great
honor to welcome you
to my poor home.

151
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,926
Oh, it isn't so bad.
Needless to say...

152
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,761
Wait a minute,
I think you're right.
It is pretty bad.

153
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,681
As a matter of fact,
it's one of the frowsiest
looking joints I've ever seen.

154
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,433
Why, Captain...
Where did you
get your wallpaper?

155
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,685
You're letting
this place run down,
and what's the result?

156
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,770
You're not getting
the class of people
that you used to.

157
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,772
Why, you've got people
here that look like you!

158
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:52,151
Now, I'll tell you what to do.
We'll put up a sign outside,
"Place under new management."

159
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,862
We'll set up
a 75-cent meal that will
knock their eyes out.

160
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,156
After we knock their
eyes out, we can charge
them anything we want.

161
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,200
Now sign here and give me
your check for $1,500.

162
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,493

tell you, madam,

00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:02,911
with this
insurance policy,

00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,748

You stand before me as
one of the bravest men
of all times.

170

All right,
I'll do that.

of Africa,

172
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,599
there has been no danger
you have not dared.

I don't smoke?

174

blazed new trails,

Never once in all
those weary months did
your footsteps falter.

the caterpillar
that frightened him.

00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,336
Oh, dear.
This is unfortunate.

184

Don't stand there.
Get the whiskey!

185
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:58,300
Get the whiskey.
The whiskey? The whiskey?
Where is the whiskey?

186
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,594

00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,869

a fellow who looked
exactly like you,

192
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,621
by the name of, uh,
Emanuel Ravelli.

193
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,581
Are you his brother?
I am Emanuel Ravelli.

I'm Emanuel Ravelli.

Well, no wonder you look
like him, but I insist
there is a resemblance.

(LAUGHS) Hey,
he thinks I look alike.

197
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:42,010
Well, If you do,
it's a tough break
for both of you.

198
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,264
You are one of
the musicians, but you were
not due until tomorrow.

199
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,683
Couldn't come tomorrow.
That's too quick.

200
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,351
So, you're lucky they
didn't come yesterday.

than exploring.

get an hour?

204

Oh, for playing,
we get a $10 an hour.

get for not playing?

we make special rate,

Yes, that's
for rehearsing.

for not rehearsing?
You couldn't afford it.

we don't play.

in every shop on 5th Avenue.

334
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,594
Well, if I
had any brains,

335
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,138
I'd give up painting
and get a regular job.

336
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,101
You know, I had a cousin
who made $50,000 on
Wall Street last year.

337
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,728
Oh, I don't want
to marry your cousin.

338
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,690
I'm a darn fool.
I want to marry you.

339
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,025
Say,

340
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,612
why don't we get
that old bluff, Chandler,
to buy a portrait from you?

341
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,824
Chandler? Ha!
What does he
know about art?

342
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:04,327
Well, the less he knows,
the easier it will be
for you to sell him.

343
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:07,372
They're right upstairs.
You can't miss them.

344
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,999
Go around to
the other side.

345
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,169
Mrs. Rittenhouse?

346
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:15,797
Yoo-hoo!

347
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,842
MRS. RITTENHOUSE:
Oh, Captain Spaulding,
how are you?

348
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,096
Tell me,
are you alone?

349
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,849
Captain,
I don't understand.

350
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,475
What?
You don't understand
being alone?

351
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,603
Don't give me
that innocent stuff
or you'll be alone!

352
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,772
A big cluck like you
turning cute on me!

353
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,612
Mrs. Rittenhouse?
Yes?

354
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,655
Oh, pardon me.

355
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,699
You've been
affected like this
yourself, haven't you?

356
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,493
(LAUGHS) Oh,
no, Captain.

357
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,786
Well, you will be.

358
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:50,081
Mrs. Rittenhouse,
ever since I met you,

359
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,542
I've swept you
off my feet.

360
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:54,377
Something has been
throbbing within me.

361
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:58,256
Oh, it's been beating like
the incessant tom-tom
in the primitive jungle.

362
00:20:58,341 --> 00:20:59,925
There's something
that I must ask you.

363
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,635
What is it,
Captain?

364
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,387
Would you wash out
a pair of socks for me?

365
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,473
Captain,
I'm surprised.

366
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,309
Well, that maybe surprise you,
but it's been
on my mind for weeks.

367
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,645
It's just my way
of telling you that
I love you. That's all.

368
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:12,854
I love you. I...
Captain...

369
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:16,900
Mrs. Whitehead.
I beg your pardon.
I beg your pardon.

370
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,068
Am I intruding?

371
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,527
Are you intruding?

372
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,738
Just when I had her
on the five-yard line.

373
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,282
I should say
you are intruding!

374
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,284
I should say
you are intruding!
Pardon me,

375
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:29,245
I was using
the subjunctive instead
of the past tense.

376
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,040
Yes, we're way past tents.
We're living
in bungalows now.

377
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,042
This is a mechanical age,
of course.

378
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:35,251
Mrs. Whitehead,

379
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:37,420
you haven't met
Captain Spaulding,
have you?

380
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:40,090
Why, no. I haven't.
How are you?

381
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,216
How are you?

382
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,218
I'm fine, thank you.
And how are you?

383
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,053
And how are you?

384
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,263
That leaves you
one up.

385
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:50,558
Did anyone ever tell you
you had beautiful eyes?

386
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:51,726
No.

387
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:54,729
Well, you have.
And so have you!

388
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,856
He shot her a glance.

389
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,026
As a smile played
around his lips.

390
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,779
Yes. I don't think
I've ever seen

391
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,948
four more beautiful eyes
in my life.

392
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,616
Well, three, anyway.

393
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:07,993
You know,
you two girls
have everything.

394
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:11,454
You're tall and short,
and slim and stout,
blonde and brunette,

395
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:14,040
and that's just
the kind of a girl
I crave!

396
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,209
We three would make
an ideal couple.

397
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,294
Why, you've got beauty,
charm, money.

398
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:19,671
You have that money,
haven't you?

399
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,048
Because, if you haven't,
we can quit right now.

400
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:24,009
The Captain is charming,
isn't he?

401
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:25,802
I'm fascinated.

402
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,304
I'm fascinated, too.
Right on the arm.

403
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:31,766
Fascinated.
Whim-wham.

404
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:35,645
If I were Eugene O'Neill,
I could tell you what
I really think of you two.

405
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:36,813
You know,
you're very fortunate

406
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,857
the theater guild
isn't putting this on.

407
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,358
And so is the guild.

408
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,363
Pardon me while I have
a strange interlude.

409
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,909
Why, you couple of baboons,

410
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,495
what makes you think
I'd marry either one of you?

411
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,998
Strange how the wind
blows tonight.

412
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:58,418
It has a thin, eerie voice.
Reminds me of
poor old Marsden.

413
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:01,171
How happy I could be
with either of these two

414
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:03,757
if both of them
just went away.

415
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,509
Well, what do
you say, girls?

416
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:08,011
What do you say?
Will you marry me?

417
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,637
But, Captain,
which one of us?

418
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:13,016
Both of you.
Let's all get married.
This is my party.

419
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,643
Party. Party.

420
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:18,563
Here I am talking
of parties.

421
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,107
I came down here
for a party.
What happens?

422
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:23,943
Nothing.
Not even ice cream.

423
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,530
The gods look down
and laugh.

424
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,282
This would be
a better world
for children

425
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,451
if the parents had
to eat the spinach.

426
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:34,871
Well, what do
you say, girls?

427
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,165
What do you say?
Are we all
going to get married?

428
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,958
All of us?
All of us!

429
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:40,376
But that's bigamy.

430
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:42,212
Yes, and it's
big of me, too!

431
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,672
It's big of all of us.
Let's be big for a change.

432
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,841
I'm sick of these
conventional marriages.

433
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,968
One woman and one man
was good enough for
your grandmother,

434
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,720
but who wants to marry
your grandmother?

435
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:53,056
Nobody. Not even
your grandfather.

436
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,350
Think of the honeymoon,
strictly private.

437
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,352
I wouldn't let
another woman
in on this.

438
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,312
Well, maybe one or two,
but no men.

439
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,147
I may not go, myself.

440
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:03,900
Are you suggesting
companionate marriage?

441
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,151
Well, it's got advantages.

442
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:06,277
You could live
with your folks,

443
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,321
and I could live
with your folks.

444
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:12,325
And you,
you could sell
Fuller Brushes.

445
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,161
Living with
your folks.

446
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:18,331
Living with your folks,
the beginning of the end.

447
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:21,751
Drab dead yesterdays
shutting out
beautiful tomorrows.

448
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:26,214
Hideous stumbling footsteps
creaking along the misty
corridors of time.

449
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,758
In those corridors,
I see figures,

450
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:32,470
strange figures,
weird figures.

451
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,890
Steel 186,
anaconda 74,

452
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:38,393
American Can 138.

453
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:41,604
Well, let's see.
Where were we?

454
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,690
Oh, yes! We were
about to get married.

455
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:46,317
Well, what do you think?
Do you think we really
ought to get married?

456
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:49,404
I think marriage
is a very noble
institution.

457

(MIMICS HORSE WHINNY)

It's the foundation
of the American home.

459
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:56,494
Yes, but the trouble is
you can't enforce it.

460
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,163
It was put over on
the American people...

461
00:24:58,247 --> 00:24:59,914
While our boys
were over there...

(GALS GIGGLING)
...and while our girls
were over here.

You know that I've been
waiting at the bottom of
these stairs for years

464
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,006
for just such
a moment as this.

465
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,216
Why, Captain,
where are you going?

466
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:11,718
I'm sorry, ladies,
I'm sorry,

467
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:14,012
But, uh, I'm afraid
we're gonna have to
postpone the wedding

468
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,681
for a few days,
maybe for a few years.

469
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,559
Before I get married,
I'm going to sow
a couple of wild oats.

(ALL LAUGHING)

471
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,522
The Captain's
so amusing.
Isn't he charming?

472
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:27,650
So that's the famous
Beaugard, eh?

473
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:29,360
It's a great picture,
isn't it?

474
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,029
Oh, you've
seen it before?

475
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:35,158
Seen it? I spent three
days in Paris copying it.
You did?

476
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,410
Well, me and a million
other young artists.

477
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,204
Oh.

478
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:41,497
I bet your copy
was better than
any of them.

479
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:44,083
Well, it wasn't
bad at that.
(LAUGHS)

480
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:46,461
I'll show it
to you sometime.

481
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,380
Listen.
What?

482
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,341
Mother's going
to unveil it tonight.

483
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:52,967
Yeah.

484
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,011
Suppose...

485
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:58,556
Suppose when she
unveils it, it's not
the Beaugard at all?

486
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:00,516
Suppose it's yours!

487
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:03,436
You mean, put my copy
in place of the Beaugard?
Exactly.

488
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,896
Well, Arabella,
you're crazy.

489
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,606
What good
would that do?

490
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,234
What good? Listen.

491
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:10,693
They'll unveil it.

492
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:13,029
Chandler will tell
everybody how fine it is.

493
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,365
They'll all cheer
their heads off,

494
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:17,784
and then we'll tell them
who really painted it.

495
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,410
They'll say,
you're a great artist.

496
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,537
You'll get six commissions
for paintings,

497

But what if they
don't like my painting?
What then?

500
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:32,632
Well, isn't the chance
worth taking?

501
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:41,307
Ah, I see you're
admiring my picture.
Yes, yes.

502
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:43,935
Your picture?
Yes, my picture.

503
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,937
Well, it don't look
like you.

504
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,063
Hey, wait, wait.

505
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:50,275
Someplace I met you before,
because you're face
is a very familiar.

506
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:53,695
Well, after all,
I'm one of the most
well-known men in America.

507
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,823
The newspapers will keep
on running my photograph.

508
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:59,826
You're not
Abe Kabbible?
Oh, nonsense!

509
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,374
All right. Hey, wait.
If you're not Abe Kabbible,
who are you?

510
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,585
Now, please.
Chandler is my name,
Roscoe W. Chandler.

511
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,462
Yeah, but I don't care
about the name, you see.

512
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:14,757
Someplace I met you before,
because your face
is very familiar.

513
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:16,050
Now, wait.
Let me see,

514
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,261
Were you
ever in Sing Sing?
Please!

515
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,763
No, no, Sing.
I got it. I got it.

516
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:22,181
Joliet?
Leave me alone!

517
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,517
No? All right,
don't run away.
Don't run away.

518
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,812
Leavenworth?
Oh, listen here, I have
never been in these places.

519
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,523
I spend most of
my time in Europe.
Europe.

520
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,150
I got it now.

521
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:35,278
I know. You come
from Czechoslovakia.

522
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,946
You are wrong,
I tell you...

523
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:39,657
You come from...
Hey, hey, come here,
come here.

524
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:42,035
I tell you...
Please get away
from me.

525
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,619
Hey, you remember him.
Who was he?

526
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:45,371
He comes from
Czechoslovakia.

527
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:48,041
You are wrong, I tell you.
I told you before,
you are mistaken.

528
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:51,669
He comes
from Czechoslovakia,
and I know who it is.

529
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:54,130
That's Abie
the fish peddler
from Czechoslovakia.

530
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,923
Ridiculous,
I tell you.
You are wrong.

531
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,343
Wait, wait, wait.
We prove it.

532
00:27:58,427 --> 00:27:59,844
He had a birthmark.
Remember?

533
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,472
Oh, please!
What are you...
Leave me alone.

534
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:04,307
On the arm.
On the arm.
On the leg.

535
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,726
On the foot,
up here,
on the mustache.

536
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,146
Ah-ha! There it is.
There is the birthmark.

537
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,814
Abie the fish man.

538
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:14,359
I confess. I was,
I was Abie the peddler.

539
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,986
Well, how did you
get to be
Roscoe W. Chandler?

540
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:18,780
Say, how did you get
to be an Italian?

541
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,948
Never mind.
Whose confession
is this?

542
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,158
Well, boys,
for heaven's sake,

543
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,743
don't say about
this to anybody,

544
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,495
and I think we can
come to some agreement.

545
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,373
Some arrangement
which would be, uh,
mutually satisfactory.

546
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:32,460
Money, money.
Yeah. Shall we say,
uh, $500?

547
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,380
Piker! $500.
Well, that is all
the cash I have.

548
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:36,756
$500?

549
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,842
Well, all right.
I tell you what we do.
We'll take your I.O.U.

550
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:42,678
I've given you my best offer
and that is all you will get.

551
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:44,389
That's all you give?
Yes.

552
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:48,101
(SINGING) Abie the fish man
Abie the fish man
(WHISTLING)

553
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:51,396
Abie the fish man
Abie the fish man

554
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,356
Please be quiet,
quiet!

555
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,274
Please.
Now, come here.
Now, listen here.

556
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,486
I have here
a check for $5,000. Now,
I give it to you. Yeah?

557
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:01,197
Hey. Is it good?
Well, of course
it is good.

558
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,907
Who would give me
a bad check?

559
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,242
I would.

560
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,119
Hey, see if it's good.

561
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,374
(WHISTLES)

562
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,875
All right, if you
don't want the check,

563
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,210
then that is all
you will get.

564
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,670
That's all we get?
Yeah.

565
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,048
(SINGING) Abie the fish man
Abie the fish man
Please, quiet!

566
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:22,552
Abie the fish man
Abie the fish man
Quiet!

567
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,595
Abie the fish man

568
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:27,640
Here! Give me
that handkerchief.

569
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:30,977
My tie!
Where is my tie?
I...

570
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,855
You're nothing
but a pair of thieves.
That's all.

571
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:35,022
(LAUGHS)

572
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,733
I get a the tie.
Well, what do you got?

573
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:40,111
The birthmark!
(LAUGHS)

574
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:45,491
Hey, hey,
where's your tie?

575
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:46,909
Well, I...

576
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:48,161
That's a fine way
for a millionaire

577
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:49,829
to be running around,
open at the neck.

578
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,790
Have you got garters?
Of course,
I have garters. Here.

579
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,668
Oh! They've taken
my garters, too!
A likely story.

580
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:58,212
Turning collegiate on me, eh?
Have you got socks?

581
00:29:58,297 --> 00:29:59,589
Certainly.
Here they are.

582
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:01,090
Oh, yeah.
You have got socks.

583
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:03,426
They look pretty old
to me, too.
Whose are they?

584
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,179
My old socks.
Let me introduce myself.

585
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:09,474
My name is Spaulding,
Captain Spaulding.
I am Roscoe W. Chandler.

586
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,976
Well, this is a treat,
your treat.

587
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,061
You have heard
about me?

588
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:16,606
Yes, I've heard about you
for a great many years,
Mr. Chandler,

589
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,941
and I'm getting
pretty darn sick
of it, too.

590
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,737
Quite naturally,
I've also heard of the
great Captain Spaulding.

591
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,947
Well, that's fine.
I've heard of you
and you've heard of me.

592
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,949
Now, have you ever heard
the one about
the two Irishmen?

593
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:29,452
Oh, yes!
(LAUGHS)

594
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:32,997
Now that I've got
you in hysterics,
let's get to business.

595
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,749
My name is Spaulding,
Captain Spaulding.

596
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,417
I am Roscoe W. Chandler.

597
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:39,879
And I'm Geoffrey T. Spaulding.
I bet you don't know
what the "T" stands for.

598
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,381
Uh, Thomas?
Edgar.

599
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,467
You were close, though.

600
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,093
You were close, though,
and you still are, I'll bet.

601
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,346
Now, this is what I want
to talk to you about,
Mr. Chandler.

602
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,890
How would you
like to finance
a scientific expedition?

603
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,642
Well,
that is a question.

604
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:54,977
Yes that is a question.
You certainly know a question
when you see it.

605
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:56,687
I congratulate you,
Mr. Chandler,

606
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,731
and that brings us
right back
to where we were.

607
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,275
How would you
like to finance
a scientific expedition?

608
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,278
Well, is there any
particular kind of an
expedition you had in mind?

609
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,322
Well, I tell you.
I'm getting along
in years now.

610
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,491
There's one thing
I always wanted to do
before I quit.

611
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,201
What is that?
Retire.

612
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,537
Now would you be
interested in a proposition
of that kind?

613
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,747
You know, I've always had
an idea that my retirement

614
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,667
would be the greatest
contribution to science
the world has ever known.

615
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:19,126
This is your chance,
Mr. Chandler.

616
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,920
When I think
what you have done
for this country...

617
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,588
And by the way,
what have you done
for this country?

618
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:25,341
Oh, well.
I've always tried
to do what I could,

619
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,218
especially in
the world of art.

620
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,262
Art? Well, I don't know
how we drifted
around that.

621
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:30,888
But what is
your opinion of art?

622
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:33,015
I am very glad
you asked me!

623
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,350
I withdraw the question.

624
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,685
This fellow takes
things seriously.

625
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:37,812
It isn't safe
to ask him
a simple question.

626
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,523
Tell me Mr. Chandler,
where are you planning on
putting your new opera house?

627
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:43,317
Oh, I thought
I should put it somewhere
near Central Park.

628
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,236
I see. Why don't you put it
right in Central Park?

629
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:47,530
Could we do that?
Sure. Do it at night
when no one is looking.

630
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,074
Why don't you put it
in the reservoir and get
the whole thing over with?

631
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,285
Of course,
that might interfere
with the water supply.

632
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,370
But after all,
we must remember
that art is art.

633
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,497
Still, on the other hand,
water is water, isn't it?

634
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:58,416
And east is east,
and west is west.

635
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,002
And If you take cranberries
and stew them
like applesauce,

636
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,462
it tastes more like prunes
than rhubarb does.

637
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:04,922
Now, uh,

638
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:06,632
now, you tell me
what you know.

639
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:09,635
Well, I would be
very glad to give you
my opinion.

640
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,554
Well, that's dandy.
I'll ask you
for them someday.

641
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,139
Remind me, will you?
I'll tell you what,

642
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:15,474
could you come
to my office at 10:00
tomorrow morning?

643
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:18,019
If I'm not there,
ask for Mr. Jamison,
that's my secretary,

644
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,687
and If he sees you,
I'll discharge him.

645
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,355
That's a date, now.
Saturday at 3:00.

646
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,441
No, you better
make it Tuesday,
I'm going to Europe Monday.

647
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:24,984
Pardon me.
My name is Spaulding.

648
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:26,944
I've always wanted
to meet you,
Mr. Chandler.

649
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:28,529
Tell me.
What do you think
of the traffic problem?

650
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:30,072
What do you think of
the marriage problem?

651
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:32,908
What do you think of
at night when you
go to bed, you beast?

652
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:36,370
Well, I'll tell you...
I'd rather not
discuss it any further.

653
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,372
Remember, there
are children present.

654
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,207
Well, you see,
my dear Captain,

655
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,918
in the last analysis,
it is a question of money.

656
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:46,130
The nickel today is
not what it used to be
10 years ago.

657
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,174
I'll go further than that.
I'll get off at the depot.

658
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:50,343
The nickel is not
what it was 15 years ago.

659
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:51,636
You know what this
country needs today?

660
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,721
What?
A seven-cent nickel.

661
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:57,433
Yes, sir. We've been
using the five-cent nickel
in this country since 1492.

662
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,685
Now, that's pretty near
100 years, daylight saving.

663
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,187
Now, why not give
the seven-cent nickel
a chance?

664
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,230
If that works out,
next year we could have
an eight-cent nickel.

665
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:04,440
Think what that would mean.

666
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,860
You could go to a newsstand
buy a three-cent newspaper
and get the same nickel back.

667
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:11,113
One nickel,
carefully used, would last
a family a lifetime.

668
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:13,949
Captain Spaulding,
I think that is
a wonderful idea.

669
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,201
You do, eh?
Yes.

670
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:16,702
Then there can't
be much to it.

671
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:18,954
Forget about it.
Well, uh...

672
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,792
Well, tell me,
Captain Chandler, uh,
excuse me, Spaulding.

673
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:24,710
Spaulding, Spaulding,
that's right.
Yeah.

674
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:26,545
I'm Spaulding,
you're Chandler.

675
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,089
Let's have
no more of that
either, eh?

676
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,049
It's bad enough
being Spaulding.

677
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,801
Well, tell me,
Captain Spaulding,

678
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:34,178
Spaulding is the name?
That's right.
That's right.

679
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:37,181
I'm, I'm Chan...
I'm Spaulding...

680
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,808
Could I look at
a program a minute?

681
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:42,520
I might be the "News Weekly,"
for all he knows,
or "Coming Next Week."

682
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:45,189
Well, tell me,
Captain Spaulding,
you've been quite a traveler.

683
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,816
Uh, what do you think
about South America?

684
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,192
I'm going there soon,
you know.

685
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:50,319
Is that so?
Where are you going?
Uruguay.

686
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:52,405
Well, you go Uruguay
and I'll go mine.

687
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:55,157
Say, how long has
this been going on?
Let's change the subject.

688
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,493
Take the foreign situation.
Take Abyssinia.

689
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:58,911
I'll tell you,
you take Abyssinia,

690
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,580
and I'll take a hot
butterscotch sundae
on rye bread.

691
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:03,624
Let's go and see what
the boys in the back room
will have.

yours compares
with the original.

694

All right, let's.

695
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:21,142
Oh! I don't see
any difference.

696
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,185
Well, look closer.
Maybe, you'll find
it's better.

out of the frame

From the day of our arrival,
we led an active life.

987
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:26,921
The first morning saw us
up at 6:00, breakfasted
and back in bed at 7:00.

988
00:49:27,006 --> 00:49:29,007
This was our routine
for the first three months.

989
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,801
We finally got so
we were back in bed at 6:30.

990
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:35,388
One morning, I was sitting
in front of the cabin,
smoking some meat.

991
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,015
Smoking some meat?

992
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:38,850
Yes, there wasn't
a cigar store
in the neighborhood.

993
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:41,269
As I say,
I was sitting
in front of the cabin

994
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:42,646
when I bagged
six tigers.

995
00:49:42,772 --> 00:49:43,855
Oh, Captain!
Six of them
biggest I...

996
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,358
Captain, did you
catch six tigers?

997
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:48,401
I bagged them.
I... I bagged them
to go away,

998
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:50,445
but they hung around
all afternoon.

999
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:53,782
They were the most
persistent tigers
I've ever seen.

1000
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:56,076
The principal animals
inhabiting
the African jungle

1001
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,828
are moose, elks
and Knights of Pythias.

1002
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,455
Of course,
you all know
what a moose is.

1003
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:01,790
That's big game.

1004
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:03,375
The first day
I shot two bucks.

1005
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:05,293
That was
the biggest game we had.

1006
00:50:05,378 --> 00:50:07,504
As I say,
you all know
what a moose is.

1007
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:11,549
A moose runs around
on the floor and eats cheese
and is chased by the cats.

1008
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:13,885
The elks, on the other hand,
live up in the hills.

1009
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:17,055
And in the spring,
they come down
for their annual convention.

1010
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:19,641
It is interesting
to watch them come
to the water hole.

1011
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:20,684
And you should
see them run

1012
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:23,019
when they find
it's only a water hole!

1013
00:50:23,104 --> 00:50:25,980
What they're looking
for is an elk-a-hole.

1014
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:28,817
One morning
I shot an elephant
in my pajamas.

1015
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:31,152
How he got
in my pajamas,
I don't know.

1016
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:33,238
Then we tried
to remove the tusks.

1017
00:50:33,322 --> 00:50:35,532
The tusks.
That's not so easy
to say. Tusks.

1018
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:36,783
You try that sometime.

1019
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,993
Tusks.
Oh, simple. Tusks.

1020

Pardon me,

is Spaulding.

1021

I've always wanted
to meet you,
Mr. Chandler.

1022
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,708
As I say, we tried
to remove the tusks.

1023
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:47,669
But they were
embedded in so firmly
that we couldn't bust them.

irr-elephant to what
I was talking about.

1026
00:50:54,135 --> 00:50:55,760
We took some pictures
of the native girls,

1027
00:50:55,845 --> 00:50:57,178
but they weren't developed.

1028
00:50:57,263 --> 00:50:59,013
But we're going
back again
in a couple of weeks.

00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:57,760
They have taken
the original
and left me this.

1150
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:00,179
Leave it to me.
I'll throw some light
on this subject.

1151
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:02,890
MAN: Has anyone a match?

1152
01:00:02,975 --> 01:00:05,184

1153
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:08,896

Hives, Hives, where are you?
Turn on the lights.

Mrs. Rittenhouse,
did you lose that fish again?

1155
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:13,192
MRS. RITTENHOUSE:
Oh, Captain,
I'm so worried.

1156
01:00:13,277 --> 01:00:15,611
Good heavens!
That one
is gone, too!

1157
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,655
Oh, this is awful.

1158
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:19,490
The crooks!
The crooks!
They are escaping.

1159
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:20,700
Follow me, men!

1160
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:22,118
Never mind the men,
just the women.

1161
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:23,619
Oh, Captain.
Captain!

1162
01:00:23,704 --> 01:00:24,912
MRS. RITTENHOUSE:
Captain!
Come on.

1163
01:00:24,997 --> 01:00:25,997
Right this way.

I never saw
anything so funny
in all my life.

1168
01:00:37,217 --> 01:00:40,052
It was great,
and there goes
her old party.

1169
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:42,638
Good old Hives.
Wasn't it funny?

1170
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,640
(STUTTERS)
Oh, very.

1171
01:00:44,725 --> 01:00:46,058
Why, you're
not afraid,
are you, Hives?

1172
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:48,394
Oh, no,
I'm not afraid.
Oh, dear, no.

1173
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:52,231
Only, you see, well,
they were talking
of having the police here.

1174
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:54,400
And I wouldn't want
the police to suspect me.

1175
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:55,651
Why, they wouldn't
suspect you.

1176
01:00:55,736 --> 01:00:57,528
Oh, yes,
they would.

1177
01:00:57,738 --> 01:01:00,197
You see,
the last time
they suspected me,

1178
01:01:00,282 --> 01:01:01,282
I got four years.

1179
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:02,783

Hives!

1180
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:03,868
All right, Hives.

1181
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:05,578
Give me the painting
and I'll take care of it.

1182
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:06,871
Good. Come.

Good heavens!
It's gone!
Gone?

1186
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,762
I left it in there.
There?

1187
01:01:22,888 --> 01:01:25,639
There must be
thieves at this party.
Oh, God!

1188
01:01:25,724 --> 01:01:28,434
If I'd known that,
I never would
have come.

1189
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:31,187
Wait a minute.
That professor.

1190
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:33,647
The professor!
I see!

1191
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,192
Hives, that's the fellow
in the woodpile. Now, listen.

1192
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:39,111
We've got to get
that picture
away from him!

1193
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:42,656
Might I suggest
some of this?

1194
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:45,326
What...
Oh, very satisfactory
in these cases.

1195
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,161
A few drops
on a handkerchief

1196
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:50,164
and the professor
will no longer
obstruct us.

1197
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:52,166
You are sure
it'll do the trick?

1198
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,667
Oh, absolutely.

1199
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:55,503
Would you care
to try some?

1200
01:01:55,587 --> 01:01:58,381
No, thanks, Hives.
Let's find
the professor.

1201
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:09,183
I don't see how the thief
could have gotten away.

1202
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:10,267
I wonder who
it could have been.

1203
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:12,186
It's a good thing
we substituted yours.

1204
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:14,855
Suppose that the thief
had gotten away
with the Beaugard!

1205
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,191
Oh, it would
be all right
if they stole mine.

1206
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:19,360
Oh, darling,
I... I didn't
mean that.

1207
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:21,362
But what would
mother do?

1208
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:23,697
Why, it's worth
$100,000!

1209
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:25,616
How could she have
replaced it?

1210

Oh, I understand, dear.

1211

Just think.

was right in the room
with us!

Just like Raffles.

01:02:37,629 --> 01:02:39,547
Oh, isn't it
romantic?

1215
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:46,554
All the boys I've known

1216
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:49,515
Used to say
I was made of stone

1217
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:53,185
I would always
leave them alone

till you came along

1227
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:28,721
Why am I so romantic

01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:35,269
Why am I so romantic

01:03:37,022 --> 01:03:39,565

meet mine

01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,945

something comes

01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:08,552
They just
leave me blue

so romantic

Why am I so romantic

close in your arms

You hold me

I forget all that
my mother told me

1251
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:01,897
Other girls bore me

1252
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:04,441
They just leave me blue

1253
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:11,115

had me last night.

you've gotta put
that painting back.

What are you talking?

changed last night,
you remember?

01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,284
Oh, you mean
the picture?
Yes.

01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:25,369
Hey, what's
the matter for you?

1267
01:09:25,453 --> 01:09:27,287
First you want them
downstairs, then you
want them upstairs.

them downstairs,

a wink.

Yes, I know.

Oh! (CHUCKLING)

right out from

in the syrups, too.

I don't know.
I don't know
how he got...

I didn't care about that,
but I lost the bit
you loaned me.

Never mind.
I'll get you
another bit.

Well, that'll be
two bits I owe you, then.

1301

Captain, I hope you
weren't distressed

1302
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:45,699
by last night's
unfortunate occurrence.

1303
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:47,117

that dinner
you served?

No, the painting
that was stolen.

why didn't you inform me
there was a painting stolen?

What do you think
I engaged you for?

1309
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:56,585
But, Captain,
I didn't know it.

1310
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:58,879
Well, you should
have asked me.
I didn't know it!

you'd resent that.

01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:10,349
Please keep quiet,
will you?

1316
01:11:10,642 --> 01:11:11,725
I can get along
without you, you know.

1317
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:14,311
I got along without
your father, didn't I?
Yes, and your grandfather.

1318
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:16,438
Yes, and your uncle!
Yes, and your uncle!

1319
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:17,856
Yes, and my uncle.
Captain!

1320
01:11:17,941 --> 01:11:19,816
I didn't come here
to be exonerated.

1321
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:21,568
I beg pardon,
Mrs. Rittenhouse.

1322
01:11:21,653 --> 01:11:22,903
Oh, you do, eh?

1323
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:26,323
Well, I'd like
to see you crawl
out of a rumble seat.

1324
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:29,409
The police
are here, madam.

1325
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:31,078
Oh, the police.
Have them come in.

1326
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:32,579
Oh, so, that's
your game, is it?

1327
01:11:32,664 --> 01:11:33,914
You can't
shut me up.

1328
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:35,999
Captain.
No! You can talk
to my attorney.

1329
01:11:36,084 --> 01:11:37,084
Jamison?
Yes, sir.

1330
01:11:37,168 --> 01:11:38,168
Take a letter
to my lawyers.

1331
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:40,671
I'll show you
a thing or two,
or three.

1332
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:42,881
I'll show you
a thing or three.

1333
01:11:42,966 --> 01:11:44,424
Oh, Captain.
Sending for the police.

1334
01:11:44,509 --> 01:11:46,468
Take a letter
to my lawyers!

1335
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,345
Sending for the police, eh?

1336
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:50,138
I say,
take a letter
to my lawyers!

1337
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:51,473
I am taking it!

1338
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:53,934
Uh, read me
what you have so far.

1339
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:58,271
Honorable
Charles H. Hungerdunger,

1340
01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:01,566
in care of Hungerdunger,
Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger,
Hungerdunger and McCormick.

1341
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:04,987
Semicolon.

1342
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:07,948
How do you spell
"semicolon"?

1343
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:10,033
All right,
make it a comma.

1344
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:16,039
Dear, Elsie...
No, never mind Elsie.

1345
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:20,002
Do you want me to
scratch "Elsie"?

1346
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:22,796
Well, if you enjoy
that sort of thing,
it's quite all right with me.

1347
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,799
However, I'm not interested
in your private
affairs, Jamison.

1348
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:28,677
Begin this way.
Let's start all over again.

1349
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:29,886
Honorable
Charles H. Hungerdunger,

1350
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:32,973
in care of Hungerdunger,
Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger,
Hungerdunger and McCormick.

1351
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:35,058
Gentlemen,
question mark.

1352
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:37,310
(CLEARS THROAT)

1353
01:12:37,395 --> 01:12:40,147
Do you want that, uh...
(CLEARS THROAT)
in the letter?

1354
01:12:40,231 --> 01:12:42,315
No, put that
in an envelope.

1355
01:12:42,442 --> 01:12:44,234
Now, then,

1356
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,153


in re yours
of the fifth inst.

1357
01:12:46,237 --> 01:12:48,405
Yours to hand
and beg to rep.

1358
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,574
Brackets.

1359
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:53,201
That, uh,
we have gone over
the ground carefully

1360
01:12:53,286 --> 01:12:54,828
and we seem to believe,

1361
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:57,456
I-E, to wit,
E-G, in lieu,

1362
01:12:58,249 --> 01:13:01,668
that, uh,
despite all our
precautionary measures

1363
01:13:01,753 --> 01:13:03,712
which have
been involved...

1364
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:05,797
Uh...

1365
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:08,341
We seem to believe
that it is hardly
necessary

1366
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:12,471
for us to proceed
unless we receive
an ipso facto

1367
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:15,057
that is not negligible
at this moment.

1368
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:17,267
Quotes, unquotes
and quotes.

1369
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:20,687
Uh, hoping
this finds you,
I beg you to remain...

1370
01:13:20,772 --> 01:13:22,397
Hoping this
finds him where?

1371
01:13:22,482 --> 01:13:24,316
Well, let him
worry about that.

1372
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,526
Don't be
so inquisitive,
Jamison.

1373
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:27,819
Sneak!

1374
01:13:28,446 --> 01:13:29,529
I say, hoping
this finds you,

1375
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:32,324
I beg to remain,
as of June 9th,
cordially yours. Regards.

1376
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:33,617
That's all, Jamison.

1377
01:13:33,701 --> 01:13:35,327
I'll show you
where I get off.

1378
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:37,788
Sending for the police.
(SCOFFS)

1379
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:40,373
Now read me
the letter,
Jamison.

1380
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:42,626
"Honorable Charles
H. Hungadunga..."

1381
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:44,294
"Hungerdunger."

1382
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:46,171
"Hunga... Hun."
"Hunga..."

1383
01:13:46,297 --> 01:13:48,507
"Hungerdunger."
That's it.
"Hungerdunger."

1384
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:52,511
"In care of Hungerdunger,
Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger
and McCormick."

1385
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:54,930
You've left out
a "Hungerdunger."

1386
01:13:55,223 --> 01:13:57,432
You left out
the main one, too.

1387
01:13:58,059 --> 01:14:00,852
Thought you could
slip one over on me, eh?

1388
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:04,815
All right, leave it out
and put in a windshield
wiper instead.

1389
01:14:04,899 --> 01:14:07,025
I'll tell you
what you do, Jamison.
I'll tell you what.

1390
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:10,278
Make it, uh, make it
three windshield wipers
and one "Hungerdunger."

1391
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:13,156
They won't all be there
when the letter
arrives anyhow.

1392
01:14:13,533 --> 01:14:15,575
"Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger,
Hungerdunger and McCormick."

1393
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:16,868
"And McCormick."

1394
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:18,787
"Dear Elsie, scratch."

1395
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:19,913
That won't do, Jamison.

1396
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:22,290
That won't go
through the mail,
the way you got it.

1397
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:25,377
The way you've got the letter,
you've got
McCormick scratching Elsie.

1398
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:28,421
Now you better
turn that around and
have Elsie scratch McCormick.

1399
01:14:28,506 --> 01:14:30,799
And you better turn McCormick
around, too, Jamison.

1400
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:32,384
And see what
you can do for me.

1401
01:14:33,553 --> 01:14:34,803
"Gentlemen,
question mark."

1402
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:36,763
"Gentlemen,
question mark"?

1403
01:14:36,848 --> 01:14:39,683
Put it on the penultimate,
not on the diphthongic.

1404
01:14:39,767 --> 01:14:41,852
You wanna brush up
on your Greek, Jamison.

1405
01:14:41,936 --> 01:14:44,396
Well, get a Greek
and brush up on him.

1406
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,940
"In re yours
of the fifth inst."
I see.

1407
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:50,026
Now, you said a lot
of things here

1408
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:51,403
that I didn't think
were important,

1409
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:53,155
so I just
omitted them.

1410
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:54,698
Well!
Hmm.

1411
01:14:58,536 --> 01:15:00,745
Oh, Captain!
Good gracious!

1412
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:01,913
Oh, my!

1413
01:15:02,165 --> 01:15:04,374
So, you've just
omitted them, eh?

1414
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:07,127
You've just omitted
the body of the letter,
that's all.

1415
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:09,796
You've left out the body
of the letter, that's all.

1416
01:15:09,881 --> 01:15:11,673
Yours is not
to reason why,
Jamison!

1417
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:14,384
You've left out
the body of the letter!

1418
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:18,638
All right, send it that way
and tell them
the body will follow.

1419
01:15:20,558 --> 01:15:22,434
Do you want
the body
in brackets?

1420
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:24,477
No, it'll never
get there in brackets.

1421
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:25,896
Put it in a box.

1422
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:28,899
Put it in a box
and mark it,
uh, "fragilly."

1423
01:15:30,568 --> 01:15:31,651
Mark it what?

1424
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:35,071
Mark it "fragilly."
F-R-A-G...

1425
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:39,075
Look it up, Jamison.
It's in the dictionary.
Look under "fragile."

1426
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:42,746
Look under the table
if you don't find it there.

1427
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:45,207
Uh, "Quotes,
unquotes,
and quotes."

1428
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:46,791
That's three quotes?
Yes, sir.

1429
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:48,627
Add another quote
and make it a gallon.

1430
01:15:48,753 --> 01:15:50,754
How much is it,
a gallon, Jamison?
Regards.

1431
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,048
Regards. That's
a fine letter, Jamison.
That's an epic.

1432
01:15:53,132 --> 01:15:54,132
That's dandy.

1433
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:56,301
Now, I want you
to make two carbon
copies of that letter

1434
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:57,844
and throw
the original away.

1435
01:15:57,929 --> 01:16:00,180
And when you
get through with that,
throw the carbon copies away.

1436
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:01,723
Just send
a stamp airmail.
And that's all.

1437
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,183
You may go,
Jamison.
I may go, too.

1438
01:16:03,267 --> 01:16:05,393
Mrs. Rittenhouse?

1439
01:16:05,478 --> 01:16:07,687
Yes?
I'm Inspector Hennessey
from headquarters.

1440
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:08,772
How do you do,
Inspector?

1441
01:16:08,856 --> 01:16:09,940
Let me
introduce myself.

1442
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:11,900
I'm Captain Scotland
of Spaulding Yard.

1443
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:14,027
No, I'm Captain Spaulding
of Scotland Yard.

1444
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:15,445
Please don't make
the same mistake again.

1445
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:16,863
I'm glad to know you,
Captain.

1446
01:16:16,948 --> 01:16:18,406
Well, I should think
you would be.

1447
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:19,950
Now, then, inspector,
I think between
the two of us

1448
01:16:20,034 --> 01:16:21,618
we can solve the mystery
of the stolen painting.

1449
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:22,744
Especially,
if you go home.

1450
01:16:23,371 --> 01:16:27,040
Inspector, please
don't be too hasty
about making an arrest.

1451
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:28,875
I don't want
my guests embarrassed.

1452
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:30,085
Don't worry.

1453
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:31,878
We won't
arrest anybody.

1454
01:16:31,963 --> 01:16:33,505
He's lucky
if he can stay out
of jail himself.

1455
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:36,841
Mr. Jamison,
would you mind taking
the inspector and his men

1456
01:16:36,968 --> 01:16:39,844
to the library
and showing them
the scene of the crime?

1457
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:41,221
Certainly,
Mrs. Rittenhouse.

1458
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:42,555
Right this way,
Inspector.

1459
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,140
Come on, boys.

1460
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:51,773
And, Jamison,
count the spoons.

1461
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:55,318
Captain, I didn't know
you'd been a detective.

1462
01:16:55,403 --> 01:16:57,404
There's a whole lot
of things you don't know.

1463
01:16:57,488 --> 01:16:58,738
I suppose that's so.

1464
01:16:58,823 --> 01:17:00,448
You know darn well
it's so.

1465
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:03,368
Where were you
on the night
of June 5, 1774?

1466
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:04,786
I'm afraid
I don't know.

1467
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,788
You bet you
don't know.
Where was I?

1468
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:07,872
I don't know.

1469
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:10,250
Well, I don't know, either.
And if I did know
I wouldn't tell you.

1470
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:12,043
Put that
in your pipe
and smoke it.

1471
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:13,712
Take a number
from one to 10.

1472
01:17:13,838 --> 01:17:16,006
All right.
All right.
What's the number?

1473
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:18,133
Seven.
That's right.
Seven is right.

1474
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:20,176
I could have done it
with one hand
if I wanted.

1475
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:23,805
This is no mystery. I could
solve this in five minutes
if I wanted to worry.

1476
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:26,308
Captain, I don't
want you to worry.

1477
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:28,977
I don't want
anything to interfere
with your weekend.

1478
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:30,478
Nothing ever
interferes with
my weekend,

1479
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:32,397
and I'll thank you
not to get personal,
Mrs. Rittenhouse.

1480
01:17:32,523 --> 01:17:34,024
Captain.
Captain, I assure you...
Where's my secretary?

1481
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:35,483
I didn't mean...
No, no. Where's
my secretary?

1482
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:37,986
Jamison, Jamison?
Captain, you
misunderstood me.

1483
01:17:38,112 --> 01:17:39,654
Oh!
A more
dastardly crack

1484
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:41,114
I've never heard.
Oh. Captain, please.

1485
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:43,658
I wish I was back
in the jungle where
men are monkeys.

1486

I'm so sorry.
Jamison!

1487
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:47,329
Jamison? No.
Oh, Captain.

1488
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:48,496
Oh, dear.
No!

1489
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:51,416
(CHUCKLES) Good morning,
Mrs. Rittenhouse.

1490
01:17:51,751 --> 01:17:52,792
Good morning.

1491
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:54,294
Perfectly
charming party.

I wouldn't
have missed it
for the world.

1493
01:17:56,881 --> 01:17:58,965
It's just full
of surprises.

1494
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:01,593
So glad you're
enjoying yourself.

Good morning.
Some breakfast?

01:18:09,477 --> 01:18:11,519
Breakfast, nothing.
Did you get
the painting?

1498
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:13,480
No, I did not.
I watched all night,

1499
01:18:13,564 --> 01:18:15,148
but the professor
did not sleep

1500
01:18:15,232 --> 01:18:16,441
in his room.
No?

1501
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:18,318
Strange.
Very strange.

1502
01:18:18,402 --> 01:18:20,320
Good heavens, Hives!
What will we do?

1503
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:23,156
I don't know.
Until we see
the professor.

he'll not get away
from me this time.

Did you get it?
Good.
Yes, madam.

1511
01:19:17,628 --> 01:19:20,004
Now, I'll go ahead
and engage him
in conversation.

1512
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:21,381
You'll trail behind,

1513
01:19:21,465 --> 01:19:24,759
and when the proper
time comes,
see that he gets it.

Very good,

I've been looking
all over for you.

you been?

with this?

you got there,

the one I want.

the painting.

out on the terrace.

and it's not the Beaugard,

whose is it?
Where did it
come from?

1562
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:24,814
Oh, don't you see?
Someone else came along

1563
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:26,858

for mine,

getting away with

to keep a sharp lookout.

did find him.

from my room!

that back.

my watch back.

01:25:11,899 --> 01:25:14,233
Beaugard is dead?
Then it's murder!

1641
01:25:14,318 --> 01:25:16,360
Now we've got something.
What you got, Captain?

1642
01:25:16,445 --> 01:25:17,779
I got jacks and aces.
What do you got?

1643
01:25:17,863 --> 01:25:18,946
That's good.
I was bluffing.

1644
01:25:19,031 --> 01:25:20,573
Look at this, Ravelli.
Isn't there something

1645
01:25:20,657 --> 01:25:22,283
strikes you very funny
about this picture?

1646
01:25:22,826 --> 01:25:23,993
(LAUGHS)

1647
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:26,788
Oh, come, come.
It isn't as funny
as all that.

1648
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:29,081
Did you ever see
a tree like that?

1649
01:25:29,166 --> 01:25:31,042
Tree? That's
a spinach.

1650
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:34,003
That can't be spinach.
Where's the egg?

1651
01:25:34,254 --> 01:25:36,923
Well, it could be spinach.
Look, all the sand
laying around there.

1652
01:25:37,007 --> 01:25:38,633
You mean,
it's an old
spinach custom?

1653
01:25:38,717 --> 01:25:39,884
No, it's not that,
Ravelli.

1654
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,177
Anything but that.
Oh. No, Cap.

1655
01:25:41,261 --> 01:25:42,720
That's all right.
It's my mistake.

1656
01:25:42,805 --> 01:25:44,430
You know
what that is?
That's coleslaw.

1657
01:25:44,515 --> 01:25:46,349
Coleslaw?
Yeah, it's a coleslaw.

1658
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:47,934
Did you ever
see coleslaw
like that?

1659
01:25:48,018 --> 01:25:49,894
Sure, look
at this one.

1660
01:25:50,103 --> 01:25:51,729
No, I don't want one
on your lip, now.

1661
01:25:51,814 --> 01:25:53,439
Did you ever see
anything like that?

1662
01:25:53,524 --> 01:25:55,107
Did you ever see
anything like that?

1663
01:25:55,192 --> 01:25:56,317
You know
what this is?

1664
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:57,652
This is a left-handed
painting.

1665
01:25:57,736 --> 01:25:58,820
Look, there's
a signature.

1666
01:25:58,904 --> 01:26:00,279
That's right, it's in
the right-hand corner.

1667
01:26:00,364 --> 01:26:02,240
That's right.
This is either
a left-handed painting

1668
01:26:02,324 --> 01:26:03,533
or a vegetable dinner.

1669
01:26:03,617 --> 01:26:05,993
Now, if we can find
the left-handed person
that painted this,

1670
01:26:06,078 --> 01:26:07,954
we'll have
The Trial of Mary Dugan
with sound.

1671
01:26:08,038 --> 01:26:09,539
Well, I saw that.
Good-bye.

1672
01:26:09,623 --> 01:26:12,250
Now, you wait here.
I'm gonna need you.
Now, look.

1673
01:26:12,334 --> 01:26:14,377
We mustn't lose this.
This is evidence.

1674
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:17,588
Now, take it to your room
and leave the door open
this time. We'll try that.

1675
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:20,967
And not a word
about this to anybody,
not even to me.

1676
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:25,555
Ravelli, we have
got to find the
left-handed painting.

1677
01:26:25,681 --> 01:26:27,306
Yes, the left-handed
painter.
Now in a case like this

1678
01:26:27,391 --> 01:26:29,600
the first thing to do
is to find the motive.

1679
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:31,102
Now, what could
have been the motive
of the guy

1680
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:32,937
who has swapped
the Beaugard?

1681
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:35,356
I got it!
Robbery!

1682
01:26:36,441 --> 01:26:38,150
Would you mind
going out and crossing
the boulevard

1683
01:26:38,235 --> 01:26:40,069
when the lights
are against you?

1684
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:41,821
See, Cap,
sit down.

1685
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,448
You understand,
I got an idea
how to find this painting.

1686
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:48,369
In a case like this
that is so mysterious,
you gotta get at the clues.

1687
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:50,413
You gotta use
the Sherlock Holmes method.

1688
01:26:50,497 --> 01:26:52,123
Now, you go
about it like this.

1689
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:54,083
You say to yourself,
"What happened?"

1690
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:57,503
And the answer come back,
"Something was stolen."

1691
01:26:57,588 --> 01:27:00,673
Then you say to yourself,
"What was stolen?"

1692
01:27:00,757 --> 01:27:03,384
And the answer
come back,
"A painting."

1693
01:27:05,596 --> 01:27:07,805
What are you,
a ventriloquist?

1694
01:27:08,098 --> 01:27:11,642
Now you say to yourself,
"Where was this
painting stolen?"

1695
01:27:11,727 --> 01:27:14,437
And the answer
come back,
"In this house."

1696
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:16,647
Now, so far
I'm right, eh?

1697
01:27:16,857 --> 01:27:18,024
Well, it's pretty hard
to be wrong

1698
01:27:18,108 --> 01:27:20,860
if you keep
answering yourself
all the time.

1699
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:22,737
Now you go a little further,
and you say to yourself,

1700
01:27:22,821 --> 01:27:24,196
"Who stole the painting?"

1701
01:27:24,281 --> 01:27:26,407
This is a very, very
important question.

1702
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:29,660
Captain, you get the answer,
you've got the solution
to the whole thing.

1703
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:32,246
Especially if you
find the picture.

1704
01:27:32,331 --> 01:27:33,664
Now you take
all the clues.

1705
01:27:33,749 --> 01:27:35,666
You put them together.
What do you got, eh?

1706
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:38,210
A bread pudding.
No, here's what we got.

1707
01:27:38,295 --> 01:27:39,462
Something was stolen.

1708
01:27:39,546 --> 01:27:41,672
Stolen where?
In this house.
Stolen by who?

1709
01:27:41,757 --> 01:27:42,965
Somebody
in the house.

1710
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:46,135
Now to find the painting,
you only gotta do is
go to everybody in the house

1711
01:27:46,219 --> 01:27:48,137
and ask them
if they took it.

1712
01:27:48,221 --> 01:27:51,849
You know, I could
rent you out as a decoy
for duck hunters?

1713
01:27:52,309 --> 01:27:53,726
You say you're gonna
go to everybody
in the house

1714
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:55,561
and ask them
if they took
the painting?

1715
01:27:55,646 --> 01:27:57,521
Suppose nobody
in the house
took the painting.

1716
01:27:57,606 --> 01:27:59,190
Go to the house
next door.

1717
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:00,274
That's great.

1718
01:28:00,359 --> 01:28:02,652
Suppose there isn't
any house next door.

1719
01:28:02,736 --> 01:28:05,780
Well, then of course
we gotta build one.

1720
01:28:05,864 --> 01:28:09,200
Well, now you're talking.
What kind of house do you
think we ought put up?

1721
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:10,576
Well, I'll tell ya, Cap.

1722
01:28:10,661 --> 01:28:14,330
You see. My idea of a house
is something nice and small
and comfortable.

1723
01:28:14,414 --> 01:28:15,539
That's the way
I feel about it.

1724
01:28:15,624 --> 01:28:16,749
I don't want
anything elaborate.

1725
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:18,417
Just a little place
that I can call home

1726
01:28:18,502 --> 01:28:20,711
and tell the wife
I won't be there
for dinner.

1727
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:23,214
I see. You just want
a telephone booth.

1728
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:26,717
No, in that case,
I'll get in touch
with Chic Sales.

1729
01:28:26,802 --> 01:28:30,346
Now, what do you say, Cap,
we build right about here?

1730
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:31,764
Here?
Yeah, right
about here.

1731
01:28:31,848 --> 01:28:34,600
Oh, I'd like
something over here
if I could get it.

1732
01:28:34,685 --> 01:28:38,104
I don't like junior
crossing the tracks on
his way to the reform school.

1733
01:28:38,188 --> 01:28:40,272
I don't like junior
at all, as a matter
of fact.

1734
01:28:40,357 --> 01:28:42,942
All right, all right.
We got something
over there.

1735
01:28:43,026 --> 01:28:46,612
And believe me,
that's convenient.
That's very convenient.

1736
01:28:46,697 --> 01:28:48,906
Well, all you gotta do
is open the door,

1737
01:28:48,991 --> 01:28:50,950
step outside
and there you are.

1738
01:28:51,034 --> 01:28:52,201
There you are?
Yeah.

1739
01:28:52,285 --> 01:28:54,495
"There you
are" where?
Outside.

1740
01:28:55,414 --> 01:28:56,956
Well, suppose
you want to get
back in again?

1741
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,833
You had no right
to go out.

1742
01:28:58,917 --> 01:29:02,169
Well, don't do
anything until I hear
from you, will you?

1743
01:29:02,254 --> 01:29:04,505
Say, maybe
that's the painting
down in the cellar!

1744
01:29:04,589 --> 01:29:06,590
That's no cellar.
That's the roof.

1745
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:07,800
That's the roof?
Down there?

1746
01:29:07,884 --> 01:29:09,719
Yeah, you see, we keep
the roof in the basement,

1747
01:29:09,803 --> 01:29:12,054
so when the rain comes,
the chimney don't get wet.

1748
01:29:13,056 --> 01:29:14,807
I'm going out
and get X-rayed.

1749
01:29:14,891 --> 01:29:16,851
I'll be back
in a little while.

1750
01:29:16,935 --> 01:29:19,145
I may be wonderful,
but I think
you're wrong, Ravelli.

1751
01:29:19,229 --> 01:29:21,981
Hey, wait,
don't get up excited.
Come here.

1752
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:23,607
Now, look,
here's the rooms.

1753
01:29:23,734 --> 01:29:25,526
Those are the rooms?
Yeah. Right,
there's the rooms.

1754
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:26,819
This is your room.

1755
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:29,780
This is my room
and this is
the maid's room.

1756
01:29:30,032 --> 01:29:32,491
Oh, I'd have to go
through your room?

1757
01:29:32,576 --> 01:29:33,701
(LAUGHS)

1758
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:37,747
Ah! That's all right.
I won't be in it.

1759
01:29:38,248 --> 01:29:39,665
Say, Ravelli,

1760
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:41,709
you couldn't
put the maid
in your room, eh?

1761
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:44,045
What makes you think
I couldn't?

1762
01:29:44,129 --> 01:29:47,298
Well, there's gonna be
a lot of traffic in there.
I can see that.

1763
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:50,593
Well, what do you say?
You ready to sign
the lease?

1764
01:29:51,428 --> 01:29:52,470
Well, it's a little
premature.

1765
01:29:52,554 --> 01:29:54,013
I'd like to discuss it
with my husband.

1766
01:29:54,097 --> 01:29:55,890
Could you come back
this evening
when he is home?

1767
01:29:55,974 --> 01:29:57,141
Hey, you married?

1768
01:29:57,309 --> 01:29:59,018
Why, I've got
a girl as big
as you are.

1769
01:29:59,102 --> 01:30:00,728
All right,
get me one.

1770
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:02,688
Don't get vulgar,
Ravelli.

1771
01:30:02,773 --> 01:30:04,774
Ravelli, how about
the painting?

1772
01:30:04,858 --> 01:30:06,484
We take care
of that, all right.

1773
01:30:06,568 --> 01:30:07,735
Now, I tell you
what my idea is.

1774
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:09,361
I think the kitchen
should be white.

1775
01:30:09,446 --> 01:30:11,322
Outside green,
inside cerise
with blue...

1776
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:13,532
The painting, I say.
How about the painting,
Ravelli?

1777
01:30:13,617 --> 01:30:15,451
All right,
what do you think I talk?
That's painting.

1778
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:17,620
The kitchen white,
outside green, inside cerise.

1779
01:30:17,704 --> 01:30:19,622
The painting.
The painting
that was stolen.

1780
01:30:19,706 --> 01:30:20,706
Stolen?

1781
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:22,500
Don't you remember
Mrs. Rittenhouse lost

1782
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:25,169
a valuable Beaugard
painting worth $100,000?

1783
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:27,254
Don't you remember that?

1784
01:30:27,506 --> 01:30:29,924
No, I'm a stranger
around here.
I no remember that.

1785
01:30:30,008 --> 01:30:32,718
What do you think I am,
one of the early settlers?

1786
01:30:32,803 --> 01:30:33,886
Ravelli,
don't you remember,

1787
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:38,015
Mrs. Beaugard lost
a valuable Rittenhouse
painting worth $100,000?

1788
01:30:38,225 --> 01:30:39,558
Don't you remember that?

1789
01:30:39,643 --> 01:30:42,311
No, but I've seen you
someplace before.

1790
01:30:44,231 --> 01:30:45,272
Well, I don't know
where I was,

1791
01:30:45,357 --> 01:30:47,316
but I'll stay
out of there
in the future.

1792
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:49,944
Hey, Cap,
it come to me
like a flash!

1793
01:30:50,153 --> 01:30:52,488
This painting
wasn't stolen. Huh!

1794
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:53,781
You know
what happened?

1795
01:30:53,865 --> 01:30:55,741
This painting, Cap,
is disappear.

1796
01:30:55,826 --> 01:30:57,451
Vanish.
Yes, it disappear.

1797
01:30:57,536 --> 01:30:59,870
And you know what
make it disappear?
You'll never guess, Cap.

1798
01:30:59,955 --> 01:31:02,081
What do you think
make this painting
disappear, eh?

1799
01:31:02,165 --> 01:31:06,043
Moths! Moths eat it!
Left-handed moths.

1800
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:13,425
Go away. Go away.
I'll be all right
in a minute.

1801
01:31:13,635 --> 01:31:15,636
Left-handed moths
ate the painting, eh?

1802
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:17,263
That's my own solution.

1803
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:19,140
I wish you were in it.

1804
01:31:19,224 --> 01:31:21,016
Left-handed moths
ate the painting.

1805
01:31:21,977 --> 01:31:24,687
You know, I'd buy you
a parachute if I thought
it wouldn't open.

1806
01:31:25,438 --> 01:31:26,772
Hey, I got
pair of shoes.

1808
01:31:29,693 --> 01:31:30,818
That's crazy.

1809
01:31:30,902 --> 01:31:32,945
Come on, let's get out
and get the reward.
We solved it.

1810
01:31:33,029 --> 01:31:35,156
You solved it!
The credit
is all yours.

1811
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:37,032
The painting was eaten
by a left-handed moth.

1812
01:31:37,117 --> 01:31:38,742
Hey, I know, we did
a good day's work.

1813
01:31:38,869 --> 01:31:40,202
How do you feel?
Tired?
It's worth it.

1814
01:31:40,287 --> 01:31:42,413
Maybe you ought to lie down
for a couple of years, eh?
Well...

1815
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:44,540
Why don't you just lie down
until rigor mortis sets in?

1816
01:31:44,624 --> 01:31:46,041
Yeah. That's nothing.
Come on, Ravelli.

1817
01:31:46,126 --> 01:31:47,835
I'll show you how
we get the painting.
Yeah.

1818
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:50,796
We go to court
and we get out a writ
of habeas corpus.

1819
01:31:50,881 --> 01:31:52,882
You're gonna
get rid of what?

1820
01:31:52,966 --> 01:31:56,010
Oh, I should never
have started that way.
I can see that.

1821
01:31:56,094 --> 01:31:59,638
I say, we'll go to court
and we'll get a writ
of habeas corpus.

1822
01:31:59,723 --> 01:32:01,098
Yeah, scorpus,
scorpus.

1823
01:32:01,183 --> 01:32:02,975
Didn't you ever
see a habeas corpus?

1824
01:32:03,059 --> 01:32:04,977
No, but I see

1828
01:32:11,735 --> 01:32:13,569
Good morning.

1829
01:32:14,279 --> 01:32:15,529
Mr. Chandler,

1830
01:32:15,614 --> 01:32:17,615
why don't you go
down to the beach
with the others?

1831
01:32:17,699 --> 01:32:19,450
I'm sure
you'd feel better.

1832
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:22,036
If I had my Beaugard,
I'm sure I'd feel better.

1833
01:32:22,287 --> 01:32:24,705
Oh, but we're doing
everything we can.

1834
01:32:24,789 --> 01:32:26,832
Mrs. Rittenhouse,
Mrs. Rittenhouse!
I have it.

1835
01:32:26,917 --> 01:32:27,917
The Beaugard!

1836
01:32:28,001 --> 01:32:29,919
Wonderful!
My Beaugard!

1837
01:32:30,253 --> 01:32:32,046
Wait, this is
not my Beaugard!

1838
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:34,381
This is a rank imitation.
Where did you find it?

1839
01:32:34,466 --> 01:32:35,507
Why, in Mr. uh...

1840
01:32:35,592 --> 01:32:37,343
In Mr. Parker's
room, madam.

1841
01:32:37,427 --> 01:32:38,636
Parker!

1842
01:32:38,845 --> 01:32:40,012
One thing
is certain!

1843
01:32:40,096 --> 01:32:42,473
The man who made that,
stole the Beaugard!

1844
01:32:42,599 --> 01:32:45,726
Hives, find Mr. Parker
and ask him to come here.
Certainly, madam.

1845
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:47,519
Wait a minute.
My men will
bring him in.

1846
01:32:47,604 --> 01:32:49,355
Go out and get
Mr. Parker.

1847
01:32:49,439 --> 01:32:50,564
Oh, what's
the matter
with this?

1848
01:32:50,649 --> 01:32:53,859
Well, look at here.
You've only to look
at it once to see what it is.

1849
01:32:53,944 --> 01:32:55,736
It is a rank nothing!

1850
01:33:18,635 --> 01:33:21,720
Mother, what's wrong?
I can come in without
being pulled in.

1851
01:33:21,805 --> 01:33:24,473
Mr. Parker, something
very mysterious
has occurred.

1852
01:33:24,557 --> 01:33:26,892
And I'm afraid,
you're the only one
who can explain.

1853
01:33:26,977 --> 01:33:28,644
I'd be only
too glad to
if I can.

1854
01:33:28,728 --> 01:33:29,770
Nothing mysterious
about it.

1855
01:33:29,854 --> 01:33:30,854
We found this
in your room.

1856
01:33:30,939 --> 01:33:32,815
Now, what have
you done with
the original Beaugard?

1857
01:33:32,899 --> 01:33:34,066
Come clean!

1858
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:35,109
Come on,
out with it.

1859
01:33:35,193 --> 01:33:36,193
Really, I think
I would be wise...

1860
01:33:36,278 --> 01:33:37,778
Well, I have
nothing to say.

1861
01:33:37,862 --> 01:33:39,405
Except that I don't know
where the Beaugard is.

1862
01:33:39,489 --> 01:33:41,407
Oh, how is it
we found this
in your room?

1863
01:33:41,491 --> 01:33:42,866
Come on!
You better come with me.

1864
01:33:42,951 --> 01:33:43,951
You can't take him!

1865
01:33:44,035 --> 01:33:45,286

1871

coming to you from

that suit on
upside down

or there is
no law of gravity.

Oh, Captain,
what shall I do?

1877
01:34:26,536 --> 01:34:27,828
They're going
to arrest John.

1878
01:34:27,871 --> 01:34:29,455
Who's going
to arrest John?
I am, Captain.

1879
01:34:29,539 --> 01:34:30,914
Oh, you are, eh?
Well, let me
tell you something.

1880
01:34:30,999 --> 01:34:32,708
The first thing
they teach you
at Scotland Yard

1881
01:34:32,792 --> 01:34:34,043
is never to arrest
an innocent man.

1882
01:34:34,127 --> 01:34:35,294
But he's
not innocent.

1883
01:34:35,378 --> 01:34:36,879
I'll have
to arrest him
just the same.

1884
01:34:37,172 --> 01:34:39,798
By all means
or nobody will
be safe here.

1885
01:34:39,883 --> 01:34:41,425
You can't
arrest him!

1886
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:42,926

MRS. RITTENHOUSE: Arabella!

1887
01:34:43,011 --> 01:34:44,595
Don't listen to her,
Officer. I did it.

1888
01:34:44,763 --> 01:34:46,305
They're both lying.
I did it!

1889
01:34:46,389 --> 01:34:47,556
I did it with
my little hatchet.

1890
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:49,099
Eh, he's crazy.
He's crazy.

1891
01:34:49,184 --> 01:34:50,559
I confess,
I did it.

1892
01:34:50,643 --> 01:34:52,186
Or maybe
nobody stole
the painting.

1893
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:53,395
Maybe there was
no painting.

1894
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:55,731
That's right, maybe
there was no painting.
I saw it.

01:34:55,815 --> 01:34:56,940
Cut out
all the talk.

1896
01:34:57,025 --> 01:34:58,275

the painting?

1897
01:34:58,360 --> 01:34:59,693
ALL: I did.

1898
01:34:59,778 --> 01:35:00,778
Good gracious!
What!

1899
01:35:00,904 --> 01:35:02,571
MRS. RITTENHOUSE:
What in the...

1900
01:35:02,655 --> 01:35:03,655
What? You?

1901
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:04,823
You took
the picture?

1902
01:35:04,908 --> 01:35:06,325
Where is it?

1903
01:35:06,743 --> 01:35:08,452
Oh, that's
a horse.

That is my Beaugard!

1905

No, that isn't
your Beaugard.

1906
01:35:15,919 --> 01:35:16,919
Don't be ridiculous.

1907
01:35:17,003 --> 01:35:18,879
I paid $100,000
for this painting.

1908
01:35:18,963 --> 01:35:19,963
I know
what I bought.

1909
01:35:20,048 --> 01:35:22,174
Well, look at
the signature.

1910
01:35:22,592 --> 01:35:24,134
"John Parker."

1911
01:35:24,344 --> 01:35:26,178
Somebody changed it.

1912
01:35:32,268 --> 01:35:33,685
That is my Beaugard!

1913
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:35,813
That is the Beaugard,
I tell you!

1914
01:35:35,897 --> 01:35:36,897
There it is!

1915
01:35:37,190 --> 01:35:38,607
Ah, but that one.

1916
01:35:38,691 --> 01:35:42,361
That has the color,
the depth, the soul
of the Beaugard!

1917
01:35:42,445 --> 01:35:44,822
Only a master could
have produced
a painting like that.

1918
01:35:44,906 --> 01:35:46,865
Oh, John.

1919
01:35:46,991 --> 01:35:49,451
You mean to tell me
that you painted that?
Yes, sir.

Why, young man,
you're a genius!
You're a genius!

to paint a portrait
of me immediately!

wait until tomorrow.

busy all day.

come with me,

Don't take him away,
Officer.

1927
01:36:05,468 --> 01:36:07,469
He returned
the paintings.

to meet you.

All right.
I'll let him go
this time.

1931
01:36:13,977 --> 01:36:15,602
But I want to give you
some advice.

kind of people.

Oh, why don't
you go home?

01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:24,528
He's got no home.

1936
01:36:24,612 --> 01:36:27,197
Go home
for a few nights
and stay home.

light burning in...

...burning
in the window.

No, you can't.
The gas company
turned it off.

is for your own good.

to me...

surprised me!

I thought he had
more than that.

giving you
any advice.

01:37:39,812 --> 01:37:40,979
Hey, what's
the idea?

1964
01:37:41,064 --> 01:37:42,648
Jamison,
take a letter
to my lawyer!

1965
01:37:42,732 --> 01:37:44,233
No, no! Oh, no!

1966
01:37:44,317 --> 01:37:46,860
Oh, no, no!
Not... Oh.

1967
01:37:46,945 --> 01:37:49,738
Oh, to think
that I've got
to go so young.

1968
01:37:57,038 --> 01:37:58,497
Good. Come on, now.
Let's get out of here

1969
01:37:58,581 --> 01:37:59,831
before they all wake up.

1970
01:37:59,916 --> 01:38:02,876
Hurry up!
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.
