Oh, Roger, you haven't
forgotten about the party?

5
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:56,988
No, but I'm afraid I can't make it.

6
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,055
- But you've got to come. You promised.
- The whole crowd's going to be there.

7
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,125
And besides, I've saved
all my Waltzes for you.

8
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,343
We'll make them up next time.

9
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:07,354
It's going to be the
best party of the year.

10
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:10,067
- Sorry. Good night.
- (women) Good night.

11
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,330
I've gotta run, Aunt Sophie.
Can you get home all right?

12
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:15,175
Yes, but I did want you
to go to that lovely party.

13
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,181
Good night, dear.
I'll see you first thing in the morning.

14
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,649
- Good night, Professor Heinrich.
- You did very well, my boy.

15
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:24,655
But your pizzicato -
we still have to work on it.

16
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,624
Remember, as more you press,
as less comes out.

17
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,717
I'll take care of it first
thing in the morning.

18
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:32,262
Don't overdo yourself, dear.

19
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,095
Why did you have to say that?
His pizzicatos were perfect.

20
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:40,764
Perhaps, but these young people today,
we have to keep after them all the time.

21
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,500
If he's going to be a great musician...

22
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:45,702
If he's going to be a great musician?
A boy with his talent?

23
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:49,872
Why, do you know where he's gone now?
To work. In the Excelsior bakery.

24
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:54,612
Slaving away half the night in order to
have more time to practice in the daytime.

25
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,982
- So?
- Yes.

But you didn't give 'em a chance!

32
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,872
I won't get the stink

I'll get my lawyer! I'll sue ya!

00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,947
Don't bring that flute back in here!

37
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:37,256
Say, you must be
kinda hard to please tonight.

38
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:41,398
- Hey, wait a minute!
- What do you want?

39
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,602
Well, it wouldn't be fresh air
in this cute little cottage.

Hey, hey!

41
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:50,165
They tell me you're going in for music.

Well... here I am.

43
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,013
- What do you play?
- I don't play, I sing.

44
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,778
I've been up at Lefty's for three months.

45
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,149
Well, if you're so good,
why ain't you up there now?

46
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:06,452
Well, Lefty got fresh and I quit.
But I know I'll be safe here.

47
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:09,755
Sure. You'll be safe here.

48
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:14,697
Sure. Just as safe
as in the crater of a volcano.

49
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,824
Give us a beer.

50
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,698
Hey, I'm gonna knock you
right out of your seat tonight.

51
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:22,638
- I wouldn't be surprised.
- I've got something here that's dynamite.

52
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:27,041
Brand-new. Nobody in Barbary Coast
has ever heard anything like it before.

53
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,102
You must have wrote it yourself.

54
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:32,615
No, a friend sent it to me from New York.

- Sure. I'm seein' the world.

- Boy, am I glad to see you.

- Hiya, kid.
- Hi, babe.

63
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,502
We went through school together,
up to the fifth grade,

64
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,337
and boy, could she spell 'em down.
Here, grab yourself a seat, Stell.

65

Hey! (whistles) Bring us some beer.

You're looking like a million, baby.

- Never even learned short division.

- Hiya.

00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,122
- Did the other outfit show up yet?
- Yeah.

73
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:24,259
They just got thrown out.
Just wait a minute.

74
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:28,362
Say, boss. These boys play great.
You oughta hear 'em.

75
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,466
- Tim Dolan send 'em over?
- No, I told 'em to come over.

his uncle's a cop. A friend of mine.

You're paid to draw beer.

- <i>(all)</i> Yes, sir.

- We're pretty good, too.

We've been rehearsing for weeks.
Wait till you hear us.

81
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,517
- Why aren't the others in uniform?
- You see, I was dressed for a concert.

82

Oh, we can hire 'em for you
if you want 'em.

83

Eh, you don't look so hot to me.

84
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:58,432
But all right. I'll give you a try.

- What's the matter?
- The music.

89
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,939
- What?
- It's gone!

90
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,741
- But you had it.
- I must have left it on the streetcar.

91
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,577
- You couldn't have done that.
- What are we gonna do?

92
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:15,244
- Well, are you guys gonna play or not?
- (band) Oh, sure.

93
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,788
Here. Take this. It's music.

94
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:22,122
- Brand-new. Just come from New York.
- Music, you'd better be good.

95
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:25,355
If they start throwing bottles at us,
I'll meet you boys on the ferry.

00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:02,180
I came here to get a job for myself,
not for this bunch.

119
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:04,653
It was my music and my singing
that put them over.

- Yeah, but listen...
- They don't know to play. They're rotten.

Oh, and I suppose just because
you can stand up here and shout,

122
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:10,756
that you know everything
about music, huh?

123
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,922
Fight it out among yourselves,
but it's all of you or nothing.

Beer on the house

- It's Alexander to me.

126
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,063
Come on with that beer.

127
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,302
- So I don't know music, huh?
- No.

128
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:28,004
Well, maybe I don't know
the tripe they play up on Snob Hill,

129
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,741
but I know what they like down here
and that's more than you'll ever know.

130
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:33,716
And if you think that I'm gonna work with
you, you've got another guess coming.

131
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,344
Oh, what made you think
that I'd want you with my band?

132
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,888
Your band?!

133
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,049
- Oh, give me my music...
- Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.

134

This is a situation.
Let's try and figure it out.

135

Oh, I've got it all figured out.

136
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:48,560
And I don't want any more to do with you.
Is that plain, fancy-pants?

137
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,295
- Always a pleasure to meet a lady.
- You bet it is.

- Say, you were good.
- I know it.

139
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,404
- Let her go.
- Girlie!

140
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,004
Gee, look at what you've done.
Everything's going along swell

141
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,670
and you have to start
an argument with her.

142
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:05,341
- That girl's a whiz.
- (excited cheering)

143
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,278
Wait a minute. Let's be reasonable.

144
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,290
Reasonable? Say, what do you think
I am? A half-wit or something?

145
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:16,122
Don't pay attention to him. He didn't mean
it. He was just shooting off his mouth.

146
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,856
Come on back. Let's pretend
it didn't happen. We all need the job.

147
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:22,024
Oh, say, I wouldn't go back there
if it was the last job on earth.

148
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,625
I've seen all I want
of that stuck-up pain in the neck.

149
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,692
- Yeah, but look...
- Let go of me.

You call this an opening?

You should have seen the outfit I was with

That was an opening.

00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:45,846
Hello, Martha? It's Roger.
Listen, I've got to talk to Aunt Sophie.

164
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,385
I'll try. Will you hold the phone, please?

165
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,454
It's Roger again.

166
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:59,018
I have nothing to say to him.

167
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:05,730
<i>I'm very sorry, Roger.
She won't talk to you.</i>

168
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:10,137
All right. Thank you, Martha.
Good night.

169
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,279
<i>Alexander! Hey! (whistles)</i>

170
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,337
- You, Alexander!
- Yes?

171
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,950
Thank you. Professor Heinrich!

172
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:27,616
- So your name's Alexander now?
- Yes, that's right.

173
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,184
Uh, won't you come in and...
sit down and have a glass of beer?

174
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,491
Not tonight.

175
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:37,932
I just want to know
if you're really serious about all this.

176
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,867
Oh, yes. Very.

177
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:45,102
But Roger, you spent your whole life
preparing yourself for something fine.

178
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:49,544
How can you throw it all away on this...
this ragtime?

179
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:53,049
But I like ragtime. I believe in it.

180
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,416
And besides, I have
what I've always wanted: a band.

181
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:59,319
Won't you stay and listen?
See for yourself.

182
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:03,417
No. You know your own mind.
You always have.

183
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,521
- Good night.
- Good night, Professor.

184
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,258
Hey, come on, come on!
Let's have a little life around here.

185
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:14,133
- Bring on that girl.
- Right away.

186
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,269
- (Stella) Who is it?
- It's me.

187
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,811
- What do you want?
- I want to see how you look.

188
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:24,279
Oh, I look swell.

189
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:28,250
- Do you mind if I see for myself?
- No, come on in. What do I care?

190
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,814
It cost me my last dime.

191
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:40,363
- Very nice.
- Oh, thanks, Mr. Astorbilt.

192
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:46,526
But you know, you shouldn't try to cover
up your lovely throat with those feathers.

193
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:49,266
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Oh, and look at those flowers.

194
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,332
You don't really need those.
That's just gilding the lily.

195
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:53,206
Oh-oh.

196
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:56,872
And look at those ruffles. Now, that might
be all right for some skinny little girl,

197
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,610
but not for a girl
with a gorgeous figure like yours.

198
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,516
- There. Now, see what I mean?
- Hey, wait a minute!

199
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:07,183
Oh, and the very idea
of trying to cover up that beautiful hair!

200
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:10,352
- There, now.
- Why, you two-by-four snob!

201
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,226
Look what you've done.
You've ruined my dress.

202
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:17,062
Now, listen to me. You're not
dressing for your sailor friends now.

203
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,658
This isn't Dirty Eddie's.

204
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:22,433
I'm trying to build a band with class and
distinction, and I'm beginning right now.

205
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:26,601
Oh, so you're a know-it-all
about women's clothes too?

206
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,440
Well, let me tell you something.

207
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,505
I know how to dress myself and you or
nobody else is gonna tell me what to wear.

208
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:33,743
Understand?!

209
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:37,686
You're not going up there looking like
a comic valentine. And stop shouting!

210
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,984
I'll go out the way I want to
or I won't go out at all!

211
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:43,424
- All right! That suits me too.
- Well, it's good enough for me.

212
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,655
Pickleface is throwing a fit out there.
We'd better hop to it.

213
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,789
- Are you ready, Stella?
- I'm not going.

214
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,890
- Oh, now, Stella...
- Oh, let her go, and good riddance.

215
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,992
I don't want a woman with the band
anyway. Come on, Charlie.

216
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:55,869
Oh, what a sap I was to let you
talk me into this thing in the first place.

217
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:58,238
Oh, I knew how it would end
with that conceited...

218
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:02,245
Well, I'm surprised at you, letting him get
your goat. He didn't mean anything by it.

219
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,009
He was just a little excited tonight-
new place, a couple of new boys.

220
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,177
- You can't let us down now.
- There you go, sticking up for him again.

221
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,620
Why, look where he threw my flowers.
I should have slapped his ears down.

222
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,851
You can do that tomorrow.
You've gotta sing now.

223
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,258
Pulling out my feathers,
and giving me all that baloney

224
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,796
about my neck and my figure and my hair.

225
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:23,698
- Why, I'll see him dead first.
- You're absolutely right.

226
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,362
Don't sing for him. Sing for me.

227
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:31,305
Why, you dirty dog. Taking advantage
of my sweet nature, huh?

228
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,138
(chuckles) That's a girl, Stella.

229
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,269
Just remember the Three Musketeers.
All for one..

230
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,766
Yeah, and that one a pain in the neck.

231
00:15:36,767 --> 00:15:38,542
Yeah, and that one a pain in the neck.

232
00:15:39,903 --> 00:15:42,315
Three Musketeers, my...

233
00:15:42,372 --> 00:15:44,352

Ah! There you are, my tender little dove.
We were just coming to call on you.

239
00:17:04,387 --> 00:17:08,631
- Well, I'm in a hurry.
- Stop being a stubborn, ornery female.

240
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:10,672
You and the maestro
are gonna get acquainted.

241
00:17:10,727 --> 00:17:12,206
Say, I know all I wanna know about him.

242
00:17:12,262 --> 00:17:14,037
And no back talk.

243
00:17:14,097 --> 00:17:18,239
Get in there, the both of you.
Take those chips off your shoulders.

244
00:17:18,301 --> 00:17:20,975
You're both all right if you don't
expect too much. And remember,

245
00:17:21,037 --> 00:17:23,813
I'm staying right outside the door here,
and if I hear any yelling or screaming,

246
00:17:23,874 --> 00:17:27,617
I'm coming back in here
and knock your heads together.

247
00:17:37,687 --> 00:17:39,689
Well?

248
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:47,336
You and I have
entirely different points of view, Stella.

249
00:17:47,397 --> 00:17:49,172
But we are grown-up.

250
00:17:49,232 --> 00:17:52,543
I don't see why, with a little
common sense, we can't work together.

251
00:17:52,602 --> 00:17:54,445
A simple business arrangement.

252
00:17:54,504 --> 00:17:57,417
Listen. You're out to
set the world on fire.

253
00:17:57,474 --> 00:17:59,977
You're all hopped up with the idea
that you've got something to give

254
00:18:00,043 --> 00:18:02,023
and you're gonna do it or bust.

255
00:18:02,078 --> 00:18:06,720
Well, that's your business. All I want
is a job, and one job's as good as another.

256
00:18:06,783 --> 00:18:10,458
As long as I can pay my own way,
and you leave me alone.

257
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,127
You have a great voice.
And a great future too.

258
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,433
If you'd only realize your possibilities
and try to make something of them.

259
00:18:17,494 --> 00:18:20,373
Say, I'm doin' all right.
I am what I am,

260
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:25,880
and I'm not gonna let you make me over
into something else just to fit your plans.

261
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:31,978
I guess I have been unreasonable,
only seeing my side of it.

262
00:18:32,042 --> 00:18:34,352
But all this means so much to me.

263
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:37,017
This music, having my own band.

264
00:18:38,114 --> 00:18:40,890
Whether we like it or not, we're together.

265
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:43,989
We couldn't have gotten
this job without you,

266
00:18:44,054 --> 00:18:46,591
and you probably couldn't have
gotten it without us.

267
00:18:46,656 --> 00:18:52,004
So doesn't it seem sensible that we should
try to meet each other halfway?

268
00:18:52,062 --> 00:18:54,474
Well, it's all right with me.

269
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:58,707
Well, now! You see how easy it is.

270
00:19:02,238 --> 00:19:04,946
Something tells me
I'm sticking my head in a noose.

My, you look pretty.
Another new outfit?

Mm-hm.

282
00:21:42,398 --> 00:21:44,400
But I think it's a little too loud.

283
00:21:44,467 --> 00:21:46,913
It makes me feel like a stop sign.

284
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:50,679
I wonder if you realize how much
you've changed in the last few months?

285
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,742
What do you mean, "changed"?

286
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:56,848
Just because I pay more for my clothes
and let my hair go natural?

00:25:27,056 --> 00:25:30,265
We may be tops in this town,
but we haven't even started yet.

324
00:25:30,326 --> 00:25:31,771
Now, if you fellas wanna stick with me,

325
00:25:31,828 --> 00:25:34,900
try to get somewhere, like New York,
you're going to have to work.

326
00:25:34,964 --> 00:25:36,568
Now, come on, let's snap into it.

327
00:25:36,632 --> 00:25:41,411
Don't forget that this is an opening night.
You've gotta be better than just good.

328
00:25:41,471 --> 00:25:43,109
<i>(plays off-key)</i>

329
00:25:43,172 --> 00:25:45,880
Cut that.

330
00:25:45,942 --> 00:25:49,651
- Go ahead, Charlie.
- <i>(plays "Now</i> It Can Be Told')

331
00:26:01,023 --> 00:26:03,333
Start over again
from the beginning, Charlie.

332
00:26:03,393 --> 00:26:05,304
Louie.

333
00:26:05,361 --> 00:26:07,363
Bill.

334
00:26:08,464 --> 00:26:10,466
Take the melody.

335
00:26:12,135 --> 00:26:14,547
You take the counterpoint.

336
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,931
All right, fellas. Let's fake it
till we get our orchestrations.

337
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:38,761

338
00:28:40,383 --> 00:28:41,623

<i>(♪ reprise)</i>

340
00:28:53,362 --> 00:28:55,569
Take over for me, Charlie.

341
00:29:06,909 --> 00:29:10,015
(Stella) Imagine, you and me like this.

342
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,482
<i>(Alec) Imagine.</i>

343
00:29:13,616 --> 00:29:16,153
- <i>(Stella) What happened?</i>
- <i>(Alec)</i> Don't <i>ask me.</i>

344
00:29:16,252 --> 00:29:18,198
The roof fell in on us.

345
00:29:18,254 --> 00:29:20,291
(Stella) The minute I started
to sing that song...

346
00:29:20,356 --> 00:29:23,337
The whole world stopped for me.

347
00:29:23,392 --> 00:29:26,498
I'm afraid I even forgot to take a bow.

348
00:29:29,131 --> 00:29:31,338
Let me look at you...

349
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,402
for the first time.

350
00:29:39,342 --> 00:29:41,344
That's for tonight.

351
00:29:45,481 --> 00:29:50,226
And that's for all the times
I've wanted to break your neck.

352
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:56,096
And that's for all the times
I've wanted to slap your ears down.

353
00:29:58,761 --> 00:30:02,072
Do you suppose we've been in love
with each other all this time?

354
00:30:02,131 --> 00:30:07,774
Me? In love with that awful person with
the platinum hair and the loud mouth?

355
00:30:07,837 --> 00:30:09,407
Heaven forbid!

356
00:30:09,472 --> 00:30:12,214
Say, you were no Christmas package
yourself, you know.

357
00:30:12,274 --> 00:30:13,309
<i>(laughs)</i>

358
00:30:13,376 --> 00:30:15,356
Oh, darling.

359
00:30:15,411 --> 00:30:17,914
Don't you understand?
I'm an artist.

360
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,517
- Like Pygmalion.
- Like who?

361
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:23,086
Oh, just a Greek who took a hunk of marble

362
00:30:23,152 --> 00:30:26,133
and molded it and polished it
into a beautiful woman.

363
00:30:26,188 --> 00:30:28,099
Then fell in love with her.

364
00:30:28,157 --> 00:30:31,661
Then you mean that you've just
fallen in love with your... with your...

365
00:30:31,727 --> 00:30:34,435
- Handiwork.
- Oh, that isn't so.

366
00:30:35,364 --> 00:30:37,708
You loved me
from the first day you saw me.

367
00:30:37,767 --> 00:30:40,771
Platinum hair, loud mouth and everything.

368
00:30:40,836 --> 00:30:42,838
I guess you're right.

369
00:30:46,308 --> 00:30:49,016
This is the real thing, isn't it?

370
00:30:49,612 --> 00:30:53,617
It's the realest thing
that ever happened to me.

371
00:30:56,752 --> 00:30:58,754
<i>(whistles tune)</i>

372
00:31:03,058 --> 00:31:04,537
- Don't say a word.
- What?

373
00:31:04,593 --> 00:31:06,834
- Hello, Charlie.
- Don't apologize, don't explain.

374
00:31:06,896 --> 00:31:09,103
I know all about it.
I was there when it happened.

375
00:31:09,164 --> 00:31:11,166
I pour out my heart
in a song to some dame.

376
00:31:11,233 --> 00:31:14,077
She takes the song
and pours out her heart to the boss.

377
00:31:14,136 --> 00:31:16,343
Well, I told you it was a good song.
If you hadn't written it,

378
00:31:16,405 --> 00:31:19,011
the little lady and I would have probably
gone on through life slugging each other.

379
00:31:19,074 --> 00:31:21,054
- Well, when's the wedding?
- Don't be so practical.

380
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,851
He's just started courting me.

381
00:31:22,912 --> 00:31:26,860
There, go buy me some flowers. The
long-stemmed ones that cost $20 a dozen.

382
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:29,192
- The kind I've never had.
- I will not.

383
00:31:29,251 --> 00:31:32,460
Next you'll be wanting a Kodak, and then
a leopard coat, and then a tin Lizzie.

384
00:31:32,521 --> 00:31:35,866
- You'll get ham and eggs, and like it!
- Ham and eggs and champagne.

385
00:31:35,925 --> 00:31:38,371
- Champagne for breakfast?
- Certainly. This is a champagne breakfast.

386
00:31:38,427 --> 00:31:40,168
- Good morning. Three?
- Please.

387
00:31:40,229 --> 00:31:42,231
This way, please.

388
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,614
And while we're guzzling it,
we'll have to do a little figuring.

389
00:31:53,676 --> 00:31:56,486
- You know who's in town?
- No, who?

390
00:32:00,783 --> 00:32:03,389
(Charles) Charles Dillingham.
The big boy himself.

391
00:32:03,452 --> 00:32:07,628
Alec, this is the break
you've been waiting for.

392
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,067
Yes, sir.

393
00:32:09,124 --> 00:32:11,468
- Bring me a phone, please.
- At once.

394
00:32:11,527 --> 00:32:14,770
This is Mr. Dillingham's secretary.
Who's calling, please?

395
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,504
I'm sorry. Mr. Dillingham is busy.

396
00:32:17,566 --> 00:32:19,568
No, he's not granting any interviews.

397
00:32:19,635 --> 00:32:21,706
But this is a very important matter.

398
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:24,478
My name is Alexander.
I have a very fine band,

399
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,918
and I'm sure Mr. Dillingham
would be interested in...

400
00:32:26,976 --> 00:32:28,284
Hello?

401
00:32:28,677 --> 00:32:30,679
Hello?

402
00:32:31,647 --> 00:32:34,150
Well, that doesn't seem
to be the proper approach.

403
00:32:34,216 --> 00:32:36,822
Why don't we go down to the hotel,
grease a few palms?

404
00:32:36,885 --> 00:32:39,229
Get everybody talking about
Alexander's Ragtime Band:

405
00:32:39,288 --> 00:32:43,532
the elevator boy, the chambermaid,
the barber. Din it in his ears.

406
00:32:43,592 --> 00:32:45,731
Oh, but that would
only make him suspicious.

407
00:32:45,794 --> 00:32:49,435
I'm gonna get him to the Cliff House
if I have to drag him.

408
00:32:49,498 --> 00:32:52,274
You know, those big guys all like to eat.

409
00:32:54,937 --> 00:32:56,382
Give me that phone.

410
00:32:56,438 --> 00:33:00,250
Stella, you're marvelous.
Uh, Evergreen 2435.

411
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:02,846
I was reading an interview
of his in The Post last week.

412
00:33:02,911 --> 00:33:05,824
Uh, hello.
Uh... Mr. Dillingham's suite, please.

413
00:33:05,881 --> 00:33:07,881
But you won't be able to
get through the secretary.

414
00:33:07,916 --> 00:33:13,730
I got an idea. (French accent) Hello,
may I speak to Mr. Dillingham, please.

415
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:16,793
Well, then, will you
tell him this is Henri?

416
00:33:18,293 --> 00:33:19,499
Henri!

417
00:33:19,561 --> 00:33:23,304
I was for many years
the chef at the Astor House.

418
00:33:23,365 --> 00:33:27,780
I used to cook Pompereau Henri
special for Mr. Dillingham.

419
00:33:27,836 --> 00:33:33,013
I read he's in town and I would like to fix
for him some baby lobsters a la Henri.

420
00:33:33,075 --> 00:33:35,248
- Baby lobsters?
- What's that?

421
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:38,154
Oh, a chef named Henri wants to
cook some baby lobsters for you.

422
00:33:38,213 --> 00:33:39,123
He was formerly at the Astor.

423
00:33:39,181 --> 00:33:41,923
Baby lobsters in August?

424
00:33:41,984 --> 00:33:45,022
Must be first of the season.
Splendid. Find out where he is.

425
00:33:45,087 --> 00:33:49,035
Where am I? Where would I be?
Chef at the Cliff House, of course.

426
00:33:50,025 --> 00:33:52,505
Then I can expect him tonight?

427
00:33:52,561 --> 00:33:54,632
Oh, thank you very much!

428
00:33:56,365 --> 00:33:57,571
Kiss Papa.

429
00:33:57,633 --> 00:34:01,080
Hey, wait a minute.
I'm the guy that did it.

430

431
00:34:10,212 --> 00:34:12,214
Hey, Davey.

432
00:34:13,682 --> 00:34:14,655
What did you say?

433
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,483
I'll lay you ten to
one he doesn't show up.

434
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:20,659
Yeah? You got yourself a bet, brother.
And no welshing.

435
00:34:20,722 --> 00:34:22,133
You welsher.

436
00:34:22,191 --> 00:34:24,694
Hey, boss, how about me
doing my number for the old boy?

437
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,368
- That'll land us all on Broadway.
- Yeah. Sitting right on our curbstones.

438
00:34:29,431 --> 00:34:31,968
Come on, let's give 'em everything
you got. The clowning can come later.

439
00:34:32,034 --> 00:34:34,514
It's nerves, maestro.
We're about to be discovered.

440
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,846
- Oh, teacher, will I be discovered?
- Yes, right now.

441
00:34:36,905 --> 00:34:38,714
The number 11, boys.

442
00:34:38,774 --> 00:34:43,814
- Oh, but Mr. Dillingham ain't here yet.
- That's the idea. Or that was the idea.

443
00:34:44,446 --> 00:34:47,757
Oh, let it ride.
I've been double-crossed before.

- Listen, Ruby. Quick, lend me ten bucks.

What did you do with that ten
I gave you last night?

00:36:35,624 --> 00:36:38,798
Oh, hurry up, hurry up.
Come on. I'll pay you back.

450
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:42,672
I'd think you'd be ashamed, taking my
hard-earned money to lose in a crap game.

451
00:36:42,731 --> 00:36:44,870
Say, you oughta be glad
to lend me ten bucks!

Suppose war is declared and I gotta
go to the front and get killed in action?

453
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,779
You'd be very happy
to know that you were the one

454
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:51,715
who lent me ten bucks
when I needed it most.

455
00:36:51,773 --> 00:36:54,720
Stop. You're breaking my heart.

- You won't need a check.
- Thank you.

- Must be...
- He's here! He's here!

- Alex, let's do the new one.
- How about me? I'll slay him.

Well, I'm Charles Dillingham.

- Mr. Dillingham, the theatrical producer?
- Yes.

477

Oh, well, I really shouldn't, but... I'm
sure Mr. Alexander won't mind this time.

00:39:06,526 --> 00:39:07,903
Or is she managing the band now?

486
00:39:07,943 --> 00:39:11,220
Alex will be there when the time comes.
Come on.

487
00:39:11,279 --> 00:39:13,281
All right. Come on. Let's hit it.

488
00:39:13,348 --> 00:39:16,192
Don't let him think we're too anxious.

489
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,733
- You'll like New York.
- Oh, I know I will.

490
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:27,402
Henri, your chef, is a
great friend of mine.

491
00:39:27,462 --> 00:39:29,464
No food like his in the world.

492
00:39:29,531 --> 00:39:32,011
He's cooked me some baby lobsters.
Won't you share them with me?

493
00:39:32,067 --> 00:39:34,479
Oh, no, thank you. Thank you.

494
00:39:37,105 --> 00:39:40,416
Mm! Superb. My compliments to Henri.

495
00:39:40,475 --> 00:39:43,922
Thank you, sir. He'll be pleased, I'm sure.

496
00:39:44,746 --> 00:39:46,419
Oh, I'm sorry, I must be going.

497
00:39:46,481 --> 00:39:49,792
I've got to tell Mr. Alexander.
Excuse me, please.

498
00:39:58,059 --> 00:40:00,266
Take over for me, Charlie.

499
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:10,443
- What did he say?
- He wants me to go to New York!

500
00:40:10,505 --> 00:40:12,451
- What did he say?
- He wants me to go to New York!

501
00:40:12,507 --> 00:40:13,952
- (both) New York?
- Uh-huh.

502
00:40:14,009 --> 00:40:16,615
He's gonna make me a star.

503
00:40:16,678 --> 00:40:20,057
Oh, darling, isn't that the most wonderful
thing you ever heard?

504
00:40:20,148 --> 00:40:23,391
- Everything you've wanted for me.
- What about the band?

505
00:40:23,452 --> 00:40:27,366
He says he can't use the band right now but
I know he'll find a place for you later.

506
00:40:27,422 --> 00:40:30,665
Oh, isn't it marvelous?
I can't believe it's true.

507
00:40:30,725 --> 00:40:32,898
- Pinch <i>me.</i>
<i>- (Charlie laughs)</i>

508
00:40:32,961 --> 00:40:35,168
Then you really are going?

509
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:38,177
Of course.
This is the biggest chance I'll ever get.

510
00:40:38,233 --> 00:40:40,372
Oh, that's swell for you, Stella.

511
00:40:40,435 --> 00:40:43,006
She might at least
have talked to me about it first.

512
00:40:43,071 --> 00:40:45,847
Not just go and say yes
without even thinking about us.

513
00:40:45,907 --> 00:40:49,047
Oh, but Alex, this isn't going to
make any difference with us.

514
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:52,557
We can still be together.
You can come on to New York with me

515
00:40:52,614 --> 00:40:55,857
and I know Dillingham
will find a place for you before long.

516
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:57,988
Oh, yeah. That'd just be great.

517
00:40:58,053 --> 00:41:02,468
But you told me over and over again that I
could make something of myself if I tried.

518
00:41:02,524 --> 00:41:05,368
And now that it's happened,
you're all burned up.

519
00:41:05,427 --> 00:41:07,600
I should have known better
than to expect anything from you.

520
00:41:07,662 --> 00:41:10,142
Oh, Alec!

521
00:41:10,198 --> 00:41:13,441
Well, of all the selfish
little tinhorn sports.

522
00:41:13,502 --> 00:41:15,914
You're jealous
because he wants me and not you.

523
00:41:15,971 --> 00:41:17,382
- Now, Stella...
- Well, just remember,

524
00:41:17,439 --> 00:41:20,010
I didn't want to go
with your band in the first place.

525
00:41:20,075 --> 00:41:22,817
And all that polishing and molding -
you weren't doing that for me.

526
00:41:22,878 --> 00:41:24,585
You were doing that for yourself,

527
00:41:24,646 --> 00:41:26,648
just because you thought
it would help you get ahead.

528
00:41:26,715 --> 00:41:29,195
And now that it's backfired and helped me,
you're yelling murder.

529
00:41:29,251 --> 00:41:31,390
- All right. Go on. Get out!
- Alex...

530
00:41:31,453 --> 00:41:35,026
- Go to New York! Go with him!
- Don't think you wouldn't do the same...

531
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:36,330
Stella!

532
00:41:36,391 --> 00:41:38,098
Alec!

533
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:40,230
Don't leave her like that.

534
00:41:40,295 --> 00:41:42,969
Go back and tell her you're wrong
before it's too late.

535
00:41:43,064 --> 00:41:46,341
Siding in with her again, hey?
I'm wrong and she's right.

536
00:41:46,434 --> 00:41:50,280
Sure. You don't own Stella.
You can't order her around.

537
00:41:50,338 --> 00:41:52,818
She has a right to decide for herself.

538
00:41:52,874 --> 00:41:54,979
She doesn't owe this band a thing.

539
00:41:55,043 --> 00:41:57,785
We're liable to be stuck here
for the rest of our lives.

540
00:41:57,846 --> 00:42:00,190
- Is that the way you feel about it?
- Exactly.

541
00:42:00,248 --> 00:42:04,253
Well, then what are you sticking around
for? Why don't you clear out, too?

542
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,321
That's a good idea.

543
00:42:07,789 --> 00:42:10,793
Well, maestro, when does Alexander's
Ragtime Band hit Broadway?

544
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:14,395
There isn't any Alexander's Ragtime Band.

545
00:42:14,396 --> 00:42:14,430
There isn't any Alexander's Ragtime Band.

546

It'd be a pleasure.

smart enough to get in the Navy...

Pretty soft for those swabs.

567

No more guard duty, no more
bayonet drill. No more sore feet.

568
00:44:30,999 --> 00:44:32,842
Why didn't we go in the Navy?

569
00:44:32,901 --> 00:44:34,437
- A show in New York?
- Yeah.

570
00:44:34,502 --> 00:44:36,504
Let me see that.

571
00:44:37,205 --> 00:44:39,412
Theatricals? You're crazy.

572
00:44:39,474 --> 00:44:42,250
- I told them it was no use.
- Ridiculous, I said.

573
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:44,847
I said this wasn't the theater.
They're in the Army now.

574
00:44:44,913 --> 00:44:47,325
- But the Navy did it, sir.
- The Navy.

575
00:44:47,382 --> 00:44:50,454
- They have time for such tomfoolery.
- Besides, they have the talent.

576
00:44:50,518 --> 00:44:53,328
Talent in the Navy? Nonsense!

577
00:44:53,388 --> 00:44:56,164
If you can find talent in the Navy,
you can find it anywhere.

Right here in this camp.

579
00:44:58,726 --> 00:45:01,263

Go right into the finale.
Now, there's a change of business, too.

and coming back to center,

653
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:26,901
All right, folks. That's all
until tomorrow morning at 8:00.

654
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,566
Clear the stage. Everybody
except Miss Kirby, clear the stage.

655
00:54:29,629 --> 00:54:32,542
All right, boys.
You can get your picture now.

656
00:54:32,599 --> 00:54:34,272
Please give the boys a picture.

657
00:54:34,334 --> 00:54:37,144
How about leaning against the piano,
Miss Kirby?

658
00:54:37,204 --> 00:54:39,514
All right boys, set 'em up.

659
00:54:40,106 --> 00:54:41,551
Miss Kirby.

660
00:54:41,608 --> 00:54:43,610
All right, boys.

661
00:54:44,644 --> 00:54:47,420
- Thank you, Miss Kirby.
- You're welcome.

662
00:54:47,481 --> 00:54:51,691
- Has anyone a cigarette?
- (man) Will you try one of mine?

663
00:54:54,054 --> 00:54:56,796
- Alex!
- Hello, Stella.

664
00:54:58,558 --> 00:55:01,061
- Well, where in the world...
- I saw your name out front.

665
00:55:01,127 --> 00:55:03,903
Thought I'd just drop in and say hello.

666
00:55:03,964 --> 00:55:06,069
When did you get back?

667
00:55:06,132 --> 00:55:08,476
Oh, a couple of days ago.

668
00:55:08,535 --> 00:55:11,778
- Are you all right?
- Sure, sure.

669
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:15,251
- Did you get up to the front?
- Oh, off and on.

670
00:55:15,308 --> 00:55:19,154
But you... you didn't get hit?

671
00:55:19,212 --> 00:55:23,319
Oh, this? No, no.
Just a fad I picked up on the other side.

672
00:55:23,383 --> 00:55:28,389
Without my stick, I'd feel completely
undressed. No, no. I didn't get a scratch.

673
00:55:28,455 --> 00:55:31,231
Oh, it was all so horrible
and useless, wasn't it?

674
00:55:31,925 --> 00:55:35,202
Not altogether. It did me a lot of good.

675
00:55:35,262 --> 00:55:37,503
Made me see what a stupid ass I've been.

676
00:55:37,564 --> 00:55:41,410
Kicked my silly little world
right out from under me.

677
00:55:42,302 --> 00:55:46,079
- Will you forgive me, Stella?
- Why, of course, Alec.

678
00:55:47,207 --> 00:55:49,710
- I've never stopped loving you.
- Alec.

679
00:55:49,776 --> 00:55:53,189
Come on. Let's get out of here.
I can't just stand here talking to you.

680
00:55:53,246 --> 00:55:55,556
I've gotta kiss you,
I've gotta put my arms around you.

681
00:55:55,615 --> 00:55:56,423
Alex, please.

682
00:55:56,483 --> 00:55:58,963
You don't know what it's been like,
wanting you every second.

683
00:55:59,019 --> 00:56:01,363
You've never been out of my mind, ever.

684
00:56:01,421 --> 00:56:03,526
I don't care what's happened before,
and neither do you.

685
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:06,002
We belong to each other.

686
00:56:06,059 --> 00:56:09,973
- But... don't you know?
- Know what?

687
00:56:11,698 --> 00:56:16,443
Well, Charlie and I have been married
for more than a year.

688
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:18,572
Oh, I'm sorry.

689
00:56:18,738 --> 00:56:20,740
I thought you knew.

690
00:56:22,309 --> 00:56:25,586
No, I... I didn't know.

<i>(Charlie) Stella!</i>

692
00:56:27,814 --> 00:56:28,952
Down here, Charlie.

693
00:56:29,015 --> 00:56:31,427
- Mr. Dillingham...
- Here's Alec.

694
00:56:31,484 --> 00:56:33,293
Alec!

695
00:56:33,353 --> 00:56:35,355
Hello, Charlie.

696
00:56:35,422 --> 00:56:37,561
- How are you?
- Fine.

697
00:56:38,858 --> 00:56:42,271
Say, you fellas put on
a great show over there.

698
00:56:42,329 --> 00:56:44,434
Yeah, that's what the Kaiser thinks.

699
00:56:44,497 --> 00:56:48,206
I got as far as Hoboken
and they called the whole thing off.

700
00:56:48,268 --> 00:56:52,683
Yeah. I see you've done the songs
for Stella's new show.

701
00:56:52,739 --> 00:56:56,710
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thanks, but... blame it on Stella.

702
00:56:56,776 --> 00:56:59,120
She cracked the whip.

703
00:57:00,447 --> 00:57:02,654
It's been great seeing you two again.

704
00:57:02,716 --> 00:57:06,562
- Well, can't you have lunch with us?
- No, sorry. I, uh...

705
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,975
I got two fellas waiting
out front for me.

706
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:09,784
Oh.

707
00:57:09,823 --> 00:57:12,531
- Well, goodbye.
- So long.

708
00:57:12,592 --> 00:57:14,833
Goodbye.

709
00:57:22,669 --> 00:57:28,051
- Well, he hasn't changed much, has he?
- No.

710
00:57:29,075 --> 00:57:31,453
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.

711
00:57:32,078 --> 00:57:35,457
What did you say Mr. Dillingham wanted?

712
00:57:58,004 --> 00:58:00,314
<i>(door Opens)</i>

713
00:58:00,907 --> 00:58:02,580
Boy, have I been busy.

714
00:58:02,642 --> 00:58:06,215
I got a hold of Jim and Dirk and Reagan and
the others. We're all set for rehearsal.

715
00:58:06,279 --> 00:58:09,260
We can use the sample room in the
basement, but that's not the half of it.

716
00:58:09,315 --> 00:58:11,317
Wait till you see the
surprise I got for you.

717
00:58:11,384 --> 00:58:13,386
Uh, Jerry!

718
00:58:16,756 --> 00:58:17,757
Hit it, babe.

719

<i>(holds note)</i>

720
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,406
- What a pair of pipes.
- Jerry Allen's the name.

721
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:24,531
How do you do?

722
00:58:24,597 --> 00:58:27,510
- Wait till you hear her put over a song.
- It'll probably knock you out.

723
00:58:27,567 --> 00:58:30,377
It did all the agents.
Out every time I called.

724
00:58:30,437 --> 00:58:31,780
- Sit down, Jerry.
- Thank you.

725
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:35,581
Well, we're practically set. Alexander's
Ragtime Band back in the running.

726
00:58:35,642 --> 00:58:38,851
- Bigger and better than ever.
- What's all the hurry?

727
00:58:38,912 --> 00:58:41,518
What do you mean, what's the hurry?
We gotta get jobs.

728
00:58:41,581 --> 00:58:44,755
- Why?
- Well, we've gotta eat.

729
00:58:44,818 --> 00:58:47,389
- Why?
- Well... What?

730
00:58:47,454 --> 00:58:50,663
Say, what is this?
Listen, the bankroll is getting thin.

731
00:58:50,724 --> 00:58:53,705
Time enough to worry about that
when it's all gone. Here.

732
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,569
Ice?

733
00:58:55,628 --> 00:58:56,902
Here, drink this.

734
00:58:56,963 --> 00:58:59,102
- Are you crazy?
- Yes.

735
00:58:59,165 --> 00:59:01,975
- Do you mind?
- Certainly not. I'm a little cracked myself.

736
00:59:02,035 --> 00:59:05,414
Oh, there you are.
You see, she understands.

737
00:59:05,472 --> 00:59:09,750
She knows that we heroes have to have
a little time to adjust ourselves.

738
00:59:09,809 --> 00:59:13,586
A lot has happened while we've been
making the world safe for democracy.

739
00:59:13,646 --> 00:59:17,093
Oh, cut it. You know very well
those guys won't sit down and wait for

740
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:20,563
you to get in the mood. They'll get
other jobs. Then where'll we be?

741
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:22,622
I'll bite. Where will we be?

742
00:59:22,689 --> 00:59:24,498
Nope, nothing doing.

743
00:59:24,557 --> 00:59:27,697
- Sorry, Jerry, no jobs today.
- Well, that's all right with me.

744
00:59:27,761 --> 00:59:31,174
I'll always compromise for a good steak.

746
01:00:22,615 --> 01:00:25,619
Boy, didn't I tell you
that Jerry could put over a song?

747
01:00:25,685 --> 01:00:27,323
That's right.

748
01:00:27,387 --> 01:00:31,631
Well, anyway, it's swell music. It sure has
changed, though. It's got a new rhythm.

749
01:00:31,691 --> 01:00:34,331
- Nice and slow.
- Yeah, like syrup.

750
01:00:34,394 --> 01:00:38,035
- And it's sweet and sticky.
- What do you do with a guy like that?

751
01:00:38,097 --> 01:00:40,509
Oh, just relax
and put your mind on your drinking.

752
01:00:40,567 --> 01:00:43,446
Stop trying to maneuver him
into talking business.

753
01:00:43,503 --> 01:00:45,346
Business? What's that?

754
01:00:45,405 --> 01:00:48,818
You know, the thing you do
to take your mind off your drinking.

755
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:52,379
- Come on, Alex. Doesn't that adjust you?
- Sorry.

756
01:00:52,445 --> 01:00:54,686
- Would a dance adjust you?
- Sorry.

757
01:00:54,747 --> 01:00:56,749
Don't mention it.

Say, what are you doing in New York?

764
01:02:10,924 --> 01:02:14,337
- And outwith a baby this time of night.
- Oh, nothing.

765
01:02:14,394 --> 01:02:18,171
Say, how are you folks getting along?
You look fine.

766
01:02:18,231 --> 01:02:21,075
Well, the same to you, Bill.
Let's have a look at him.

767
01:02:21,134 --> 01:02:23,136
- Might be a her.
- Oh, not Bill.

768
01:02:23,202 --> 01:02:26,615
- He wouldn't have any feminine offspring.
- I don't think it's much to look at.

769
01:02:26,673 --> 01:02:29,654
"It"?
Why, I bet she looks just like her...

Oh, why, Bill, it's the image of you!

771
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:40,424

- Well, there ain't no way of telling that.

772
01:02:40,486 --> 01:02:42,727
- Imported?
- Yeah. All the way from Hoboken.

773
01:02:42,789 --> 01:02:46,293
Right off the boat. Probably scraped off.

774
01:02:48,895 --> 01:02:51,398
You folks have sure been doing fine,
haven't you?

775
01:02:51,464 --> 01:02:53,466
I caught your show, Stella.

776
01:02:53,533 --> 01:02:56,173
You've come a long way.
Right up on top.

777
01:02:56,235 --> 01:02:58,909
- And your music's all right, too.
- Thanks, Bill.

778
01:02:58,972 --> 01:03:03,114
Don't forget, Bill. You had a hand
in all this, way back in the beginning.

779
01:03:03,176 --> 01:03:06,385
Say, it's funny, ain't it.
You and Charlie over on Broadway

780
01:03:06,446 --> 01:03:08,926
and me and Alec
down in Greenwich Village.

781
01:03:08,982 --> 01:03:11,019
- Alec in the Village?
- Sure! Him and Davey.

782
01:03:11,084 --> 01:03:12,791
They got a swell band down at Scarbi's.

783
01:03:12,852 --> 01:03:15,389
I got 'em the job. Run across them
once when they was broke.

784
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:19,631
Come on down sometime when you think about
it. Ask for me. I'm there every night.

- All right, Bill.

790
01:03:34,107 --> 01:03:37,088
- We certainly will. Well, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

- Likewise.

794
01:03:53,159 --> 01:03:55,139
And bootlegging.

795
01:03:55,194 --> 01:03:58,801
He's probably making plenty of money at it.

796
01:03:58,931 --> 01:04:01,468
It's kinda funny at that.

797

Him and Alec and Davey together again,

Oh, I'd rather not.

01:05:34,227 --> 01:05:38,607
- I'm all right.
- Come on, Charlie. What is it?

813
01:05:40,633 --> 01:05:45,173
Well... I've been doing
a lot of thinking lately.

814
01:05:45,238 --> 01:05:49,380
Making up a lot of pretty speeches
about marriage, life and fate.

815
01:05:49,442 --> 01:05:51,649
Very profound stuff.

816
01:05:51,711 --> 01:05:57,684
But it all seems kinda silly now that
I'm sitting here talking to you like this.

817
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:02,597
Somehow doesn't go with you.
You're too honest and direct.

818
01:06:03,489 --> 01:06:05,435
Come on. Out with it.

819
01:06:08,127 --> 01:06:10,129
All right.

820
01:06:12,698 --> 01:06:14,700
Here goes.

821
01:06:16,536 --> 01:06:19,949
What do you say we call this marriage off?

822
01:06:23,342 --> 01:06:27,188
- Charlie!
- Mark it up as... experience.

823
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:31,323
A grand adventure while it lasted.

824
01:06:31,384 --> 01:06:37,357
But let's not spoil it by beginning to
pretend a lot of things we don't feel.

825
01:06:40,526 --> 01:06:43,996
You're still in love with Alec, aren't you?

826
01:06:45,097 --> 01:06:47,099
Oh, I suppose so.

827
01:06:47,833 --> 01:06:50,245
I thought I was over it, but...

828
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:54,374
Oh, I don't know. I guess you
can't turn those things off and on.

829
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,442
No. Course not.

830
01:06:58,344 --> 01:07:00,346
That's what I'm getting at.

831
01:07:00,413 --> 01:07:03,451
- Oh, but Charlie...
- No buts about it.

832
01:07:03,516 --> 01:07:06,690
I'm a lucky guy
to have had you as long as I have.

833
01:07:06,752 --> 01:07:09,824
I'm grateful for every minute of it.

834
01:07:09,889 --> 01:07:11,891
But I want you to be happy.

835
01:07:16,062 --> 01:07:18,064
Now, now, now, now.

836
01:07:21,567 --> 01:07:24,571
Don't go feminine all of a sudden.

837
01:07:24,637 --> 01:07:27,049
Just keep your mind clear.

838
01:07:27,106 --> 01:07:30,019
Go get a nice, quick, cheap divorce.

839
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:34,091
I'll make the alimony light on you.

840
01:07:34,146 --> 01:07:37,855
And if you need any witnesses,
I can arrange that, too.

841
01:07:37,917 --> 01:07:41,956
And you two hotheads
can pick up where you left off.

842
01:07:47,994 --> 01:07:50,770
You haven't left me with a word to say.

843
01:07:50,830 --> 01:07:54,835
That's good.
People talk too much anyhow.

844
01:07:55,868 --> 01:07:59,611
Now will you change your mind
about that highball?

845
01:07:59,672 --> 01:08:01,618
Yes, I will.

846
01:08:03,709 --> 01:08:05,950
And a great, big one.

847
01:08:24,429 --> 01:08:26,431
<i>(♪ Swing)</i>

848
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,840
- Hey, Stella!
- Bill!

849
01:08:30,902 --> 01:08:33,348
What do you know about this?
I've been wishing you would show up.

850
01:08:33,405 --> 01:08:35,112
This makes it unanimous.

851
01:08:35,173 --> 01:08:39,087
- Hey, you look positively handsome.
- I'm dressed up for the party.

852
01:08:39,144 --> 01:08:41,988
- Party?
- Sure. Come on!

853
01:08:46,752 --> 01:08:49,289
- Stella!
- Davey!

854
01:08:49,354 --> 01:08:51,732
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

855
01:08:51,790 --> 01:08:55,397
Boy, are you terrific! You look like
you were born on Fifth Avenue.

856
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:58,498
You look pretty swell yourself.
How've you been, anyhow?

857
01:08:58,563 --> 01:09:01,373
Never better. And where's
that old son of a gun Charlie?

858
01:09:01,433 --> 01:09:04,414
- I ain't seen him in years and years.
- He's out of town.

859
01:09:04,469 --> 01:09:07,882
Oh, that's a shame. He's the only one
of the old gang that's not here.

860
01:09:07,939 --> 01:09:10,920
Well, come on! This calls for a drink.

861
01:09:11,576 --> 01:09:14,056
Attention, everybody!

862
01:09:14,112 --> 01:09:17,093
Our own personal gift to Broadway,
Stella Kirby.

863
01:09:17,149 --> 01:09:19,390
It's like old home week, isn't it, maestro?

864
01:09:19,451 --> 01:09:22,193
Just in time for the celebration.
Won't you sit down?

865
01:09:22,254 --> 01:09:24,359
- Uh, Miss Allen, Mrs. Dwyer.
- How do you do?

866
01:09:24,423 --> 01:09:26,369
- How's Charlie, Stella?
- Oh, fine, thanks.

867
01:09:26,425 --> 01:09:27,426
That's good.

868
01:09:27,492 --> 01:09:29,768
- Stella Kirby!
- Hello, Stella.

869
01:09:29,828 --> 01:09:33,332
- Oh, don't you look elegant!
- Oh, thanks, Ruby.

870
01:09:33,398 --> 01:09:35,241
Yeah, Stell, she hooked me at last.

871
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:39,715
I like that! After the way you ran after me
begging me to marry you!

872
01:09:39,771 --> 01:09:41,808
- You two are married?
- Uh-huh!

873
01:09:41,873 --> 01:09:45,514
Ah, that's what the celebration was for!
Oh, congratulations.

874
01:09:45,577 --> 01:09:47,823
That's not the only thing
we're celebrating.

875
01:09:47,848 --> 01:09:49,743
We're all leaving
for Europe tonight.

876
01:09:49,781 --> 01:09:52,557
We're going to Paris and London
and everywhere.

877
01:09:52,617 --> 01:09:55,996
Yeah, we're just getting ready
to get poured on the boat.

878
01:09:56,054 --> 01:09:58,056
- You're leaving for Europe?
- Yep.

879
01:09:58,123 --> 01:10:00,729
One of those horseshoes finally hit us
and we landed a contract.

880
01:10:00,792 --> 01:10:03,671
Oh, that's wonderful.
But it's rather sudden, isn't it?

881
01:10:03,729 --> 01:10:07,040
Well, they needed an American jazz band
in a hurry, and we were just lucky.

882
01:10:07,099 --> 01:10:11,138
Oh, lucky nothing!
Why, he's got the hottest band in town.

883
01:10:11,203 --> 01:10:13,205
And you should hear her sing.

884
01:10:13,872 --> 01:10:16,148
- You're with the band?
- Yes, I am.

885
01:10:16,208 --> 01:10:19,849
- She took your place. Didn't she, Alec?
- Oh, Jerry's great. One of the best.

886
01:10:19,911 --> 01:10:22,949
Yeah, we wanted to make it
a double wedding yesterday,

887
01:10:23,014 --> 01:10:27,156
but Alec was too busy seeing about
passports. (hiccups) Weren't you, Alec?

888
01:10:27,652 --> 01:10:30,997
We almost called the trip off after
we got a look at our passport pictures.

889
01:10:31,056 --> 01:10:33,730
The boys look like gangsters
and I look like a washed-out moll.

890
01:10:33,792 --> 01:10:36,898
Say, a couple of friends of mine from
the press want you to give 'em a story

891
01:10:36,962 --> 01:10:39,033
about Alexander's Ragtime Band.

892
01:10:39,097 --> 01:10:41,771
Oh, it'll only take you a minute.
They're just sitting right over there

893
01:10:41,833 --> 01:10:44,245
and it'll be good publicity for the speak.

894
01:10:44,302 --> 01:10:45,576
Sure. All right.

895
01:10:45,637 --> 01:10:47,583
Will you excuse me?

896
01:10:47,639 --> 01:10:50,643
You better hurry and get your drinking
done. We got less than an hour.

897
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:53,383
Yeah, hurry up, everybody.

898
01:10:54,279 --> 01:10:56,623
- Sorry I missed hearing you sing.
- Thank you.

899
01:10:56,681 --> 01:10:58,854
I enjoyed your show very much.

900
01:10:58,917 --> 01:11:01,625
- How long have you been with the band?
- Ever since they started.

901
01:11:01,686 --> 01:11:03,688
In fact, I was one of the charter members.

902
01:11:03,755 --> 01:11:06,668
Then you must have met Alex
soon after he came back from the war.

903
01:11:06,725 --> 01:11:09,729
Yes. He was still in
somewhat of a daze from it.

904
01:11:09,795 --> 01:11:12,332
I stepped in
and sort of helped him snap out of it.

905
01:11:12,397 --> 01:11:15,469
- That was very fortunate for him.
- Yeah, and for me too.

906
01:11:15,534 --> 01:11:19,539
Let me tell you something, Stella.
There's one swell girl.

907
01:11:19,604 --> 01:11:22,312
Why, everything Alec is now,
he owes to her.

908
01:11:22,374 --> 01:11:25,821
You know how Alec is. Moody and funny.

909
01:11:25,877 --> 01:11:28,824
And when he found out
that you and Charlie were married,

910
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:31,884
well, after all,
that was kind of a sock on the nose.

911
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:36,365
Why, if it hadn't been for Jerry, he might
have turned into a no-good tramp.

912
01:11:36,421 --> 01:11:38,458
But she caught him just in time.

913
01:11:38,523 --> 01:11:40,696
And now look at him!
On his way to Paris!

914
01:11:40,759 --> 01:11:42,568
Compliments of the party
over in the corner.

915
01:11:42,627 --> 01:11:44,868
They wanna know
if you'll sing a little song for them.

916
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:48,742
- You know that one you did Sunday night?
- I'm on a vacation.

917
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:51,474
They're big spenders.
They're sure gonna be disappointed.

918
01:11:51,536 --> 01:11:56,417
- Sorry. Not tonight.
- Oh, please do. I'd love to hear you.

919
01:11:56,474 --> 01:11:58,920
- All right, Bill.
- Thanks.

920
01:12:00,278 --> 01:12:03,623
All right, hold it. Hold it. Hold it.
Get "Blue Skies" ready.

921
01:12:05,116 --> 01:12:06,823
Ladies and gentlemen!

922
01:12:06,885 --> 01:12:10,765
This little lady, before leaving
for Paris, France and abroad tonight,

923
01:12:10,822 --> 01:12:13,098
is going to favor us
with a beautiful ballad

924
01:12:13,158 --> 01:12:15,502
one that I know that
you'll all enjoy as much as I have.

925
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:17,665
And that's saying a lot
'cause I've heard 'em all.

926
01:12:17,829 --> 01:12:23,404
So here goes, folks! The one and only,
the tops, Miss Jerry Allen!

928
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:38,517
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
a great celebrity with us here tonight.

929
01:13:38,576 --> 01:13:40,283
I want you all to meet her.

930
01:13:40,345 --> 01:13:42,586
Miss Stella Kirby!

931
01:13:42,647 --> 01:13:45,150

Come on, Stella, sing!

01:13:48,086 --> 01:13:50,589

01:16:57,942 --> 01:16:59,683
Sorry to keep you waiting, Stella.

940
01:16:59,744 --> 01:17:02,918
Mac, I'm leaving the show.

941
01:17:02,981 --> 01:17:06,485
- You're what?
- I can't continue on.

942
01:17:09,554 --> 01:17:12,194
You're tired.
You've been on the road for ten weeks.

943
01:17:12,257 --> 01:17:15,033
But you're in Chicago now.
We should have along run.

944
01:17:15,093 --> 01:17:17,164
In another week,
you'll feel like a new person.

945
01:17:17,228 --> 01:17:19,230
Oh, no. It's more than that.

946
01:17:19,297 --> 01:17:22,767
I'm only messing things up
and ruining the show.

947
01:17:22,834 --> 01:17:25,280
I just can't stay on, I tell you.

948
01:17:25,336 --> 01:17:27,873
But Mr. Dillingham
has great plans for you, Stella.

949
01:17:27,939 --> 01:17:30,476
You can't throw opportunities
away like this.

950
01:17:30,542 --> 01:17:33,580
I'm an old hand at throwing things away.

951
01:17:33,645 --> 01:17:37,183
Stella, this is something
that I can't decide.

952
01:17:37,248 --> 01:17:41,196
Mr. Dillingham will have to do that.
You wait here.

953
01:17:42,287 --> 01:17:44,289
I'm going to get him.

954
01:17:45,256 --> 01:17:47,532

958
01:23:16,486 --> 01:23:18,466
Gesundheit. I'm gonna take you home,

959
01:23:18,522 --> 01:23:21,867
put your feet in mustard water
and give you a good dose of castor oil.

960
01:23:21,925 --> 01:23:23,029
Over my dead body.

961
01:23:23,093 --> 01:23:25,403
I knew you were crazy
wanting to walk in this rain.

962
01:23:25,462 --> 01:23:29,774
Come on, get out of the wet.
There'll be a taxi along in a minute.

963
01:23:29,833 --> 01:23:32,643
Someday I'm gonna
take a good sock at you.

964
01:23:32,702 --> 01:23:35,114
Go ahead. Right on the button.

965
01:23:38,074 --> 01:23:40,111
Jerry.

966
01:23:40,177 --> 01:23:42,248
Let's get married.

967
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:45,751
Have you got a fever?
You sound delirious.

968
01:23:45,815 --> 01:23:48,955
No, I mean it. Now, tonight.

969
01:23:49,019 --> 01:23:52,728
Oh, no, thanks.
You really don't wanna marry me.

970
01:23:52,789 --> 01:23:56,464
You're just trying to
avoid the bachelor tax.

971
01:23:59,963 --> 01:24:03,968
- Don't you think we'd hit it off together?
- Course. We always have.

972
01:24:04,034 --> 01:24:07,379
- Then why not?
- Because you're not in love with me, Alex.

973
01:24:07,437 --> 01:24:09,974
I used to think you might be, someday.

974
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,646
But I was wrong.

975
01:24:12,709 --> 01:24:16,213
- You mean an awful lot to me, Jerry.
- I know I do.

976
01:24:16,279 --> 01:24:19,192
But that's not enough to marry on.

977
01:24:19,249 --> 01:24:22,059
Oh, I'm not complaining
and I'm not asking for a thing.

978
01:24:22,118 --> 01:24:24,189
When this is over, it'll be over.

979
01:24:24,254 --> 01:24:28,293
There'll be no weeping at the bar,
as far as I'm concerned.

980
01:24:28,358 --> 01:24:30,360
Just remember that.

981
01:24:31,628 --> 01:24:33,904
You think much too straight for me, Jerry.

982
01:24:33,964 --> 01:24:36,103
Like the rest of you modern, clever women.

983
01:24:36,166 --> 01:24:40,046
Come on, here comes a cab. You can't talk
yourself out of taking that castor oil.

984
01:24:49,579 --> 01:24:52,992
Oh, Mr. Alexander!
May I have your autograph?

985
01:24:53,049 --> 01:24:55,051
Certainly.

986
01:24:57,420 --> 01:24:59,525
It's a shame to bother you like this.

987
01:24:59,589 --> 01:25:01,899
It'd bother me a lot more if you didn't.

988
01:25:01,958 --> 01:25:04,632
- Mine too, please.
- Thank you.

989
01:25:08,331 --> 01:25:12,177
Pardon me, Mr. Alexander, but we're ready
when you are for the audition in room B.

990
01:25:12,235 --> 01:25:13,976
Thank you. I'll be right along.

991
01:25:14,037 --> 01:25:16,039
- Whose is this?
- Mine.

992
01:25:18,575 --> 01:25:21,556
<i>(sings comedic tune)</i>

993
01:25:29,786 --> 01:25:31,561
That's swell. Good comedy, boys.

994
01:25:31,621 --> 01:25:34,625
- But I want a ballad for Miss Allen.
- We've got a million of them.

995
01:25:34,691 --> 01:25:37,365
We'll be back tomorrow with a ballad
that'll tear your heart out.

996
01:25:37,427 --> 01:25:39,429
- Thanks very much, boys. So long.
- Thank you.

997
01:25:39,496 --> 01:25:40,839
Thank you. Goodbye.

998
01:25:42,666 --> 01:25:44,839
Will you come in, please?

999
01:25:49,806 --> 01:25:53,276
Well, Charlie. You old son of a gun.

1000
01:25:53,343 --> 01:25:57,553
- Hello, Alec.
- Say, this is great. How are you, anyhow?

1001
01:25:57,614 --> 01:26:00,823
- Fine. Fine. And you?
- Swell.

1002
01:26:00,884 --> 01:26:02,886
Come on. Sit down.

1003
01:26:04,087 --> 01:26:07,432
Gosh, I've been reading plenty about you.

1004
01:26:07,490 --> 01:26:09,561
You must have had all Europe
for a press agent.

1005
01:26:09,626 --> 01:26:12,436
Oh, they just happen to like
American music over there.

1006
01:26:12,495 --> 01:26:16,033
Don't try to kid me.
I've heard you on the radio.

1007
01:26:16,099 --> 01:26:18,636
Good old Charlie.
How are they going, anyway?

1008
01:26:18,702 --> 01:26:21,444
Oh, fine. Still pounding them out.

1009
01:26:21,504 --> 01:26:24,451
As long as "moon" rhymes with "June,"
I'm OK.

1010
01:26:24,507 --> 01:26:26,851
- I guess we're both pretty lucky.
- Yeah.

1011
01:26:26,910 --> 01:26:30,483
At least we didn't have to go back
to Dirty Eddie's.

1012
01:26:30,547 --> 01:26:34,586
Say, remember the night you played the
concert on Nob Hill and I lost the music?

1013
01:26:34,651 --> 01:26:37,962
That was a great night.
Will you wait a few minutes?

1014
01:26:38,021 --> 01:26:41,730
I wanna talk to you but I got some people
waitin' outside for audition.

1015
01:26:41,791 --> 01:26:43,793
- You're auditioning?
- Yeah.

1016
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:47,467
Then I guess you're the fella I'm supposed
to see. I'm one of that few that's waiting.

1017
01:26:47,530 --> 01:26:49,635
- Next on the list, too.
- You?

1018
01:26:49,699 --> 01:26:53,340
Sure. I got a couple of ballads.
One of 'em's pretty good.

1019
01:26:53,403 --> 01:26:55,713
- Oh, great. Let's hear 'em.
- OK.

1020
01:26:58,308 --> 01:27:00,686
Ah, gee, I'm glad to see you, Charlie.

1021
01:27:00,744 --> 01:27:03,486
Don't think I'm not glad to see you.

1022
01:27:04,347 --> 01:27:07,556
- How's Stella?
- I don't know.

1023
01:27:07,617 --> 01:27:12,157
- What?
- I haven't heard from her in a long time.

1024
01:27:12,222 --> 01:27:15,431
She left town right after our divorce.

1025
01:27:15,492 --> 01:27:18,996
Divorce? You and Stella divorced?

1026
01:27:20,697 --> 01:27:22,608
Well, sure.

1027
01:27:22,665 --> 01:27:25,407
It just didn't... didn't pan out.

1028
01:27:27,404 --> 01:27:30,510
I... I knew she wasn't
in show business anymore, but...

1029
01:27:30,573 --> 01:27:35,488
I thought maybe you and she were leading a
quiet life somewhere and raising a family.

1030
01:27:35,545 --> 01:27:37,650
No. Not Stella.

1031
01:27:39,249 --> 01:27:41,286
You know how selfish she is.

1032
01:27:41,351 --> 01:27:45,959
How unreasonable. What
a double-crossing two-timer she can be.

1033
01:27:46,022 --> 01:27:47,399
Now, wait a minute!

1034
01:27:47,457 --> 01:27:50,529
Stella's the swellest girl I ever knew.
She never two-timed anybody.

1035
01:27:50,593 --> 01:27:53,733
- So you're still in love with her, huh?
- Well, what of it?

1036
01:27:53,797 --> 01:27:55,799
That's all I wanted to know.

1037
01:27:55,865 --> 01:27:58,846
Because she's still in love with you.

1038
01:28:08,611 --> 01:28:10,613
Same old Charlie.

1039
01:28:12,482 --> 01:28:14,587
And you're the same old hothead.

1040
01:28:14,651 --> 01:28:17,530
You were gonna sock me, weren't you?

1041
01:28:17,587 --> 01:28:20,431
You don't know how close you came
to having your ears slapped down.

1042
01:28:20,490 --> 01:28:23,664
Seems to me I've heard those words
before somewhere.

1043
01:28:23,726 --> 01:28:27,674
Well, what are we standing here
waiting for? Let's go find her.

1044
01:28:27,730 --> 01:28:29,732
I'm sorry I can't help you.

1045
01:28:29,799 --> 01:28:34,544
Miss Kirby left the show in Chicago
and I haven't heard anything of her since.

1046
01:28:34,604 --> 01:28:37,448
- Thanks. Thanks very much.
- Why don't you try Equity?

1047
01:28:37,507 --> 01:28:40,511
- They'll know where she is.
- Thanks very much.

1048
01:28:40,577 --> 01:28:43,251
Mr. Alexander,
Mr. Dillingham would like to talk to you.

1049
01:28:43,313 --> 01:28:45,315
He has a place for you in his new show.

1050
01:28:45,381 --> 01:28:49,420
I'm sorry. I haven't any open time
right now. Perhaps later. Goodbye.

1051
01:29:05,668 --> 01:29:08,114
Tickets, please.

1052
01:29:08,171 --> 01:29:10,447
Have your tickets ready, please.

1053
01:29:35,331 --> 01:29:37,971
- Yes, Miss?
- Does Bill work here anymore?

1054
01:29:38,034 --> 01:29:43,211
- Bill? Bill who?
- Bill. Used to be sort of a manager.

1055
01:29:43,273 --> 01:29:45,014
- Oh, you mean Bill Mulligan?
- Yes.

1056
01:29:45,074 --> 01:29:48,055
- Why, he owns the place.
- He does?

1057
01:29:48,111 --> 01:29:53,117
- Could I see him, please?
- Just wait over there. I'll call him.

1058
01:30:03,826 --> 01:30:05,828
<i>(Bill) Stella</i> Kirby.

1059
01:30:06,896 --> 01:30:08,898
Bill.

1060
01:30:09,465 --> 01:30:12,275
Oh, you look positively handsome.

1061
01:30:12,902 --> 01:30:16,577
- Where have you been?
- Oh. Around.

1062
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:19,279
I've been seeing the country.

1063
01:30:19,342 --> 01:30:21,549
And a very big country it is, too.

1064
01:30:21,611 --> 01:30:24,421
- What have you been doing?
- Singing.

1065
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:27,757
Cabarets and cafés. Anyplace.

1066
01:30:27,817 --> 01:30:30,423
You, Stella Kirby, singing in cabarets?

1067
01:30:30,486 --> 01:30:35,299
No. Lilly Lamont.
I changed my name to fit the personality.

1068
01:30:35,358 --> 01:30:39,602
When I see some of these phonies
making good today and think of you...

1069
01:30:39,662 --> 01:30:42,643
Joe, bring us a bottle of champagne.

1070
01:30:42,699 --> 01:30:45,025
No, thanks. I feel
more at home with beer.

1071
01:30:45,050 --> 01:30:46,671
Just for old times' sake.

1072
01:30:46,703 --> 01:30:49,616
- Seen Alec?
- No, I haven't.

1073
01:30:49,672 --> 01:30:52,744
- But you're going to his concert?
- I don't think so.

1074
01:30:52,809 --> 01:30:56,256
He'd be the happiest man in the world if
he thought you was out in that audience.

1075
01:30:56,312 --> 01:30:58,849
He's looked everywhere for you.

1076
01:30:58,915 --> 01:31:02,158
- Just let him think of me as I was.
- Oh, that's silly.

1077
01:31:02,218 --> 01:31:04,755
You're going to that concert with me.
I got a box.

1078
01:31:04,821 --> 01:31:08,826
No, I'm just killing time
until my train leaves tonight.

1079
01:31:08,891 --> 01:31:10,700
- Will you have dinner with me?
- Sure.

1080
01:31:10,827 --> 01:31:13,239
Good. I got something to do,
it'll take me about 20 minutes.

1081
01:31:13,296 --> 01:31:16,675
I'll come back, and you and I will listen
to the concert here, on the radio.

1082
01:31:16,733 --> 01:31:19,509
- All right, Bill.
- Save mine.

1083
01:31:23,239 --> 01:31:27,016
- Wish me luck, Aunt Sophie.
- Roger, there's nothing to be afraid of.

1084
01:31:27,076 --> 01:31:29,147
This is something
you've been doing all your life.

1085
01:31:29,212 --> 01:31:30,714
Something you believe in.

1086
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:35,354
Just think how proud Professor Heinrich
and I are of you, darling.

1087
01:31:35,418 --> 01:31:37,420
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1088
01:31:39,155 --> 01:31:41,157
<i>(professor) Thank</i> you.

1089
01:31:42,859 --> 01:31:45,840
- Where's Alec?
- He'll be here in a minute.

1090
01:31:45,895 --> 01:31:47,772
- Here he is.
- Well, here we are.

1091
01:31:47,830 --> 01:31:52,301
- It's just like Dirty Eddie's.
- Except the customers have clean collars.

1092
01:31:52,368 --> 01:31:55,178
- Well, maestro. It's your night.
- Our night.

1093
01:31:55,238 --> 01:31:56,842
The Three Musketeers.

1094
01:31:56,906 --> 01:32:01,582
We fellas better get out there.
And don't forget to be good.

1095
01:32:08,518 --> 01:32:10,520
<i>(Alec takes deep breath)</i>

1096
01:33:21,758 --> 01:33:23,931
Ruby! Ruby!

1097
01:33:26,662 --> 01:33:29,609
- Ruby! Stella's back!
- Stella? Where?

1098
01:33:29,665 --> 01:33:31,406
- She's over at my place.
- Well, why didn't you bring her?

1099
01:33:31,467 --> 01:33:33,276
Don't argue! Now, listen.

1100
01:33:33,336 --> 01:33:36,681
When this concert's over, get a hold of Alec
and tell him to beat it down to my place.

1101
01:33:36,739 --> 01:33:39,307
- I'll hold her there.
- All right.

1102
01:33:39,308 --> 01:33:39,342
- I'll hold her there.
- All right.

1103
01:33:40,542 --> 01:33:44,513
When Bill... I mean Mr. Mulligan comes
back, would you tell him I couldn't wait?

1104
01:33:44,579 --> 01:33:47,150
Why, uh... Yes, I'll tell him.

1105
01:33:47,215 --> 01:33:48,215
Thank you.

1106
01:34:00,562 --> 01:34:02,508
Taxi, ma'am?

1107
01:34:05,367 --> 01:34:07,506
<i>(driver) Taxi?</i>

1108
01:34:07,569 --> 01:34:09,571
I guess so.

1109
01:34:16,645 --> 01:34:19,353
- Where to?
- Anyplace.

1110
01:34:20,515 --> 01:34:23,985
- Just wanna go riding, eh?
- That's right.

1111
01:34:26,054 --> 01:34:29,467
- How about the park?
- Doesn't matter.

1112
01:34:32,127 --> 01:34:34,767
Would you like some music?

1113
01:34:34,830 --> 01:34:36,366
(♪ "Cheek to Cheek')

1114
01:34:40,502 --> 01:34:43,381
- Where's that coming from?
- Carnegie Hall.

1115
01:34:43,438 --> 01:34:45,975
Alexander's Ragtime Band.

1116
01:34:46,174 --> 01:34:48,484
Sure can swing it, can't he?

1117
01:34:50,379 --> 01:34:52,484
You want me to turn it off?

1118
01:34:52,547 --> 01:34:54,549
Oh, no!

1119
01:34:55,384 --> 01:34:58,763
<i>- You may leave it on.
- (applause on radio)</i>

1120
01:35:02,357 --> 01:35:04,200
(♪ "Easter Parade')

1121
01:36:32,481 --> 01:36:34,483
<i>(♪ band strikes up again)</i>

1122
01:36:41,590 --> 01:36:44,332
Park's kinda pretty tonight, ain't it?

1123
01:36:44,392 --> 01:36:46,599
Sort of springlike.

1124
01:36:46,661 --> 01:36:51,701
- Are we still in the park?
- We're just turning into 59th Street.

1125
01:36:51,766 --> 01:36:55,714
<i>(♪ Alexander's Ragtime Band
continues on radio)</i>

1126
01:37:02,611 --> 01:37:05,353
Nice just cruising around.

1127
01:37:05,413 --> 01:37:10,487
You take most fares, always in a hurry,
always wanna get someplace.

1128
01:37:10,552 --> 01:37:14,159
- Sure you ain't tired of this music?
- No.

1129
01:37:14,256 --> 01:37:16,532
Swell music.

1130
01:37:16,591 --> 01:37:19,834
That's where it comes from.
That's Carnegie Hall right there.

1131
01:37:19,895 --> 01:37:22,000
But I didn't ask to go to Carnegie Hall!

1132
01:37:22,063 --> 01:37:26,534
I know, but we gotta get out of the park
some way and this is where we landed.

1133
01:37:27,235 --> 01:37:31,240
(Stella) Driver, stop here.
I think I'll get out and walk.

1134
01:37:32,207 --> 01:37:35,245
You bet. Nice night for walking.

1135
01:37:45,086 --> 01:37:47,088
How much?

1136
01:37:47,822 --> 01:37:50,302
- One dollar.
- Is that all? Haven't we...

1137
01:37:50,358 --> 01:37:53,430
One dollar even. No more, no less.

1138
01:37:54,763 --> 01:37:56,765
- Thank you.
- Night.

1139
01:38:12,247 --> 01:38:16,559
- One, please. In the balcony.
- Sorry, miss. The house is sold out.

1140
01:38:16,618 --> 01:38:20,065
- Then I'll stand.
- No standing room left either.

1141
01:38:20,121 --> 01:38:22,123
Thanks.

1142
01:38:27,462 --> 01:38:29,840
- Ruby, she's gone!
- Who's gone?

1143
01:38:29,898 --> 01:38:31,878
Stella. When I got back
to the place, she'd beat it.

1144
01:38:31,933 --> 01:38:34,413
- Well, didn't you leave anyone with her?
- Yeah, the taxi driver and he's gone, too.

1145
01:38:34,469 --> 01:38:35,914
Well, of all the stupid,
clumsy things to do...

1146
01:38:35,971 --> 01:38:38,451
Grand Central Station.
That's our only hope.

1147
01:38:38,506 --> 01:38:42,579
You couldn't find her if you stumbled
over her. I'll attend to this myself.

1148
01:38:47,716 --> 01:38:49,718
(driver) Come on. Hop in.

1149
01:38:50,452 --> 01:38:54,229
- No, thanks. I think I'll walk.
- Come on! Come on. Get in.

1150
01:38:54,289 --> 01:38:58,066
You might as well
hear the rest of the concert.

1151
01:39:03,798 --> 01:39:05,971
Taxi!

1152
01:39:06,034 --> 01:39:08,071
- Grand Central.
- Sorry, lady, this cab's taken.

1153
01:39:08,136 --> 01:39:10,616
Oh, for goodness' sake. Taxi!

1154
01:39:10,672 --> 01:39:15,018
You shouldn't have done that.
I could have gotten out.

1155
01:39:17,245 --> 01:39:19,953
I don't feel like driving anyway.

1156
01:39:21,449 --> 01:39:23,929
I wanna listen to the music.

1157
01:39:23,985 --> 01:39:25,987
<i>(♪ "Heat Wave")</i>

1158
01:41:33,915 --> 01:41:34,950
<i>(applause on radio)</i>

1159
01:41:35,016 --> 01:41:37,997
Well, looks like that's the end.

1160
01:41:43,792 --> 01:41:45,794
Yes.

1161
01:41:45,860 --> 01:41:47,703
That's the end.

1162
01:41:54,402 --> 01:41:56,404
<i>(cheering)</i>

1163
01:41:57,672 --> 01:42:00,448
<i>(audience cheering on radio)</i>

1164
01:42:00,508 --> 01:42:02,852
You can turn the radio off now...

1165
01:42:02,911 --> 01:42:04,913
and drive on.

1166
01:42:06,948 --> 01:42:09,622
I've heard all that I wanna hear.

1167
01:42:09,684 --> 01:42:14,565
You gotta listen to "Alexander's Ragtime
Band." You can't go without hearing that.

1168
01:42:14,622 --> 01:42:17,432
But I don't wanna hear it!
Turn it off, I tell you.

1169
01:42:17,492 --> 01:42:22,771
- Why don't you wanna hear it?
- Because I can't! That's why.

1170
01:42:23,097 --> 01:42:25,134
Ladies and gentlemen,

1171
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:29,444
we're going to play "Alexander's
Ragtime Band" for two reasons.

1172
01:42:29,504 --> 01:42:34,010
One, because I consider it the first,
and best, of all swing songs.

1173
01:42:34,075 --> 01:42:39,024
And second, because it means more
to me than any other piece of music.

1174
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:41,492
<i>(on radio) Hearing it may take you back.</i>

1175
01:42:41,549 --> 01:42:43,995
<i>Playing it takes me back, too.</i>

1176
01:42:44,452 --> 01:42:47,899
And so, if you'll forgive me,
I'd like to play this song

1177
01:42:47,956 --> 01:42:51,563
not only for you and for the people
with whom you may associate it,

1178
01:42:51,626 --> 01:42:56,871
but also for the people, and especially
the one person, with whom I associate it.

1179
01:42:56,931 --> 01:42:59,502
(driver) Did you hear that, Miss Kirby?

1180
01:43:00,702 --> 01:43:04,047
- How did you know?
- Oh, I heard you sing many a time.

1181
01:43:05,073 --> 01:43:08,714
- And you remembered me?
- Sure! You was great. Listen.

1182
01:43:08,776 --> 01:43:12,553
<i>(♪ "Alexander's Ragtime Band"
intro on radio)</i>

1183
01:44:36,898 --> 01:44:38,241
Sing.

1184
01:44:38,466 --> 01:44:40,309
Sing.

1185
01:44:40,368 --> 01:44:43,372
<i>(♪ "Alexander's Ragtime Band")</i>

1186
01:45:37,325 --> 01:45:40,363
<i>(applause)</i>
