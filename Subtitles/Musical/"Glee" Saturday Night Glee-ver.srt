Well, we know this year's
nationals theme was "Vintage,"

55
00:02:51,096 --> 00:02:52,480
so we thought we needed
something old,

56
00:02:52,564 --> 00:02:54,065
but something
with a lot of energy.

57
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,900
So we thought: disco.

58
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,135
Absolutely. I don't know if
I ever told you guys this,

59
00:02:58,186 --> 00:02:59,737
but back when I was
in Glee Club,

60
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,805
we took it all the way
to nationals with

61
00:03:01,857 --> 00:03:04,408

unadulterated disco.

<i>He's got all this talent,

Oh, let's be honest, William.

98
00:04:15,764 --> 00:04:17,515
You've been out of ideas
since Madonna week.

99
00:04:17,566 --> 00:04:19,266
Why don't you
just embrace

100
00:04:19,351 --> 00:04:21,602
that lazy, horribly treacly
style of teaching

101
00:04:21,687 --> 00:04:23,053
and assign them a famous album?

102
00:04:23,105 --> 00:04:24,054
I did that last year.

103
00:04:24,106 --> 00:04:25,556
Yes, I remember, William.

00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:27,908
<i>And your Rumours week was
a resounding success</i>

105
00:04:27,993 --> 00:04:29,610
in that it seemed to solve

106
00:04:29,695 --> 00:04:32,896
everyone's problems
for about five minutes.

107
00:04:32,948 --> 00:04:35,199
Now I'm not talking about
just any album, William.

108
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,902
How about the soundtrack
that defined a generation?

109
00:04:38,954 --> 00:04:39,754
Wait for it.

110
00:04:39,838 --> 00:04:41,922

00:04:42,007 --> 00:04:43,124
I love that album.

112

You bet your ass
you love that album.

113
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:47,044
But there's just one problem--

114
00:04:47,095 --> 00:04:48,462
they hate disco.

115
00:04:48,547 --> 00:04:50,047
But they love swag.

116
00:04:50,098 --> 00:04:51,048

117
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:52,266

Let's give 'em something
to fight over.

122
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:00,808
Hmm.

00:05:00,892 --> 00:05:03,027
I'm thrilled you got into
Defiance College

124
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,479

Kurt Hummel?
Mercedes Jones?

I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I'm your biggest fan.

127
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,436
I've been to every last one
of your performances,

128
00:05:12,487 --> 00:05:14,071
<i>except West Side Story.</i>

129
00:05:14,122 --> 00:05:16,874
I boycotted that one because
you two weren't Tony and Maria.

00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,909
Why, hello, kind sir.

131
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,661

135
00:05:26,752 --> 00:05:29,470
but I swear,
I'm not here to spy.

136
00:05:29,554 --> 00:05:31,889
I want to ask your advice
about something.

137
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,808
Our coach is
Jessie St. James.

00:05:39,014 --> 00:05:40,648
You don't like it,

00:05:40,732 --> 00:05:41,899
Am I clear,

142
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:42,933
Yes, sir.

143
00:05:42,984 --> 00:05:45,269
I can't hear you!

144
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,437
Yes, sir.

145
00:05:46,488 --> 00:05:48,005
God, he's awful.

146
00:05:48,073 --> 00:05:52,443
He's nothing compared to the
kids at school... or my parents.

147
00:05:52,494 --> 00:05:54,662
Do you know how
I get through it?

148
00:05:54,746 --> 00:05:57,364
Ever since I was a kid,
I would play this game

149
00:05:57,449 --> 00:05:59,700
where I'd pretend I was
a different person,

150
00:05:59,785 --> 00:06:02,870
the person
that I dreamed of being...

151
00:06:02,954 --> 00:06:04,371
the real me.

152
00:06:04,456 --> 00:06:07,508
I even have a different name:

153
00:06:07,592 --> 00:06:09,376
"Unique."

154
00:06:09,461 --> 00:06:11,962
I got so nervous,
I almost didn't speak
to you guys today.

155
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:14,998
But then I thought,
how would Unique do it?

156
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,467
KURT:
What about NYU?

157
00:06:16,518 --> 00:06:18,636
Wait, wait.
Hold the thought.

158
00:06:18,687 --> 00:06:20,888
Someone with exquisite
taste is wearing...

159
00:06:20,972 --> 00:06:22,640
Joy. By Jean Patou.

160
00:06:23,725 --> 00:06:25,843
Kurt Hummel and Mercedes Jones,

161
00:06:25,894 --> 00:06:28,178
Unique worships
the red carpet you walk on.

162
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,898
If you two had a love child,
it would be Unique.

163
00:06:30,982 --> 00:06:33,517
And Unique's grandparents would
be Andre Leon Talley

164
00:06:33,568 --> 00:06:36,854
and Beyoncé, because only
the best will do for Unique.

165
00:06:36,905 --> 00:06:38,689
Yes, fools,
it's real chinchilla!

166
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,358
Unless you're planning on
splattering it with paint.

167
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:43,494
Then it's fake.

168
00:06:43,545 --> 00:06:45,696
KURT: Unique sounds
like a really great person.

169
00:06:45,764 --> 00:06:47,131
I hope that,

170
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,583
one day, you can build up
enough courage to be him.

171
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:51,502
Actually, Unique's a "her."

172
00:06:51,553 --> 00:06:53,203
That's why I want
your advice.

173
00:06:53,255 --> 00:06:55,473
Our regionals are
this Saturday,

174
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,542
and I want to go on stage
wearing a dress and heels.

175
00:06:58,593 --> 00:07:01,412
Because that's who I feel
like I am inside.

176
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,229
Unique.

177
00:07:02,314 --> 00:07:03,848
Yes.

178
00:07:03,915 --> 00:07:05,566
What would you do?

179
00:07:07,152 --> 00:07:08,652
(bell ringing)

180
00:07:15,827 --> 00:07:17,194
Did someone steal our floor?

181
00:07:17,245 --> 00:07:19,914
Don't worry, we'll have it back
by the end of the week.

182
00:07:19,998 --> 00:07:21,832
In the meantime,
Sue has lent us her...

183
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,751
...my very own personal,

184
00:07:23,835 --> 00:07:24,952
one-of-a-kind,
lit-from- within,

185
00:07:25,036 --> 00:07:27,571
shatterproof,
Plexiglas dance floor.

186
00:07:27,622 --> 00:07:29,072
Modeled, of course,
on the dance floor

187
00:07:29,124 --> 00:07:31,041
immortalized by a young,
musky John Travolta

188
00:07:31,092 --> 00:07:33,210

of his potency

189
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:35,245

dansical

190
00:07:35,297 --> 00:07:36,597
<i>Saturday Night Fever.</i>

191
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:38,415
Coach Sylvester, while we
applaud your proper use

192
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:39,600
of the terminology,
we told Mr. Shue

193
00:07:39,684 --> 00:07:40,985
we do not support disco
in this room.

194
00:07:41,052 --> 00:07:41,969
Ah, but some of you do.

195
00:07:42,053 --> 00:07:43,487
So for this week's assignment,

196
00:07:43,555 --> 00:07:46,557
we are going back in time...

197
00:07:46,608 --> 00:07:48,776
to the songs of
"Saturday Night Fever."

198
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,060
Come on, Mr. Shue.
That's, like,

199
00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:51,395
a record our parents listen to.

200
00:07:51,446 --> 00:07:53,531
That album, teen Solomon Grundy,

201
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,317
is one of the best-selling
soundtracks of all time.

202
00:07:56,401 --> 00:07:58,903
Tony Manero's story is
your story.

203
00:07:58,954 --> 00:08:00,738
He's a guy who works
at a paint store,

204
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:02,740
struggling to
figure out his life.

205
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,542
And the only time
he feels sure about himself

206
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,243
is when he's performing
on the dance floor.

207
00:08:06,294 --> 00:08:08,746
He has a dream.
To get out of his

208
00:08:08,797 --> 00:08:10,631
old neighborhood in Brooklyn
and get to New York City.

209
00:08:10,715 --> 00:08:13,300
And by the end of the movie,
that's what he's done.

210
00:08:13,385 --> 00:08:16,170
He's turned his
dream into a plan.

211
00:08:16,254 --> 00:08:18,088
So why the dance floor?

212
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:19,890
Well, Porcelain,
because we're going to start

213
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,258
with a dance-off.

214
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:23,093
And the winner
will receive

215
00:08:23,144 --> 00:08:25,462
a replica of
John Travolta's iconic

216
00:08:25,513 --> 00:08:28,399
white polyester suit,
which I am having a cadre

217
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,735
of expert Viennese
tailors painstakingly reproduce.

218
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,739
("Calypso Breakdown" playing)

219
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:39,994
Oh, my God, I need that suit!

220
00:08:40,078 --> 00:08:41,862
Oh, I bet that's worth
a lot of money.

221
00:08:41,947 --> 00:08:43,864
I would totally put
that suit on... eBay.

222
00:08:43,949 --> 00:08:45,032
So you just want us

223
00:08:45,116 --> 00:08:47,201
to start dancing
like Soul Train-style?

224
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:49,203
Uh, no, actually, Sue
and I will start us off.

225
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:50,871
We actually met
with Joe and Blaine beforehand.

226
00:08:50,956 --> 00:08:52,373
Just get up when you're ready.

227
00:08:52,457 --> 00:08:55,009
And everyone has to participate.
Everyone, Puck.

228
00:08:55,093 --> 00:08:56,010

You three are the finalists

282
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,256
of the Saturday Night Fever
Dance Competition.

283
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,507
Whoo!

284
00:11:32,575 --> 00:11:33,592
High stakes here.

285
00:11:33,676 --> 00:11:35,043
Which one of you
will walk away

286
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,211
with Sue's coveted
white suit?

287
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,178
Sounds kind of
cool to me.

288
00:11:37,246 --> 00:11:38,296
Oh, great.
It's yours.

289
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:39,414
Can we go now?

290
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:40,415
Okay, look.

291
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,100
This isn't really about a suit.

292
00:11:42,184 --> 00:11:43,768
It's about living
out your dreams.

293
00:11:43,853 --> 00:11:45,687
Of all the seniors
in New Directions,

294
00:11:45,754 --> 00:11:47,439
you three have
yet to decide

295
00:11:47,523 --> 00:11:49,190
what it is you want to do
with your lives.

296
00:11:49,258 --> 00:11:50,609
So your assignment
for the week:

297
00:11:50,693 --> 00:11:52,760
<i>perform a song
from Saturday Night Fever,</i>

298
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,146
and then share your hopes
for the future.

299
00:11:55,231 --> 00:11:56,731
No, wait.
The dance thing is fixed?

300
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:58,650
So what is this,
some teacher's

301
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:00,151
manipulative game
to get us tell you

302
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:02,037
what we want to be
when we grow up?

303
00:12:02,104 --> 00:12:03,805
Hey, if you want to look
at it that way, fine.

304
00:12:03,873 --> 00:12:05,907
But this is
your game,
your life.

305
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,877

time's running out.

(applause and cheering)

375
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:45,867
All right, I have
an announcement to make.

376
00:14:45,934 --> 00:14:48,036
Contrary to current opinion,

377
00:14:48,103 --> 00:14:49,821
I do have a dream.

378
00:14:49,905 --> 00:14:51,673
See, my dream is

379
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:53,291
Mariah.

380
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,210
It's Whitney--

381
00:14:55,277 --> 00:14:56,461
rest in peace.

382
00:14:56,545 --> 00:14:57,378
It's Aretha.

383
00:14:57,446 --> 00:14:58,379
Those are people.

384
00:14:58,447 --> 00:14:59,631
They aren't dreams.

385
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:01,115
My dream is to be like them.

386
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:04,085
To sing big, fat, juicy,

387
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,805
number-one hits
that inspire people.

388
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:08,923
But...

389
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:12,177
how's that supposed to happen,
even if I move to L.A.?

390
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:14,763
I don't know what to do...
or where to go.

391
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:16,464
It's scary
to even think

392
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,566
about moving all the way
across the country.

393
00:15:18,634 --> 00:15:19,984
Well, I mean,

394
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:21,636
I'm moving to New York,
Mercedes.

395
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:22,987
You'll have somewhere
to stay.

396
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:24,022
You'll...

397
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:25,774
You'll have something to do.

398
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:27,492
You have two parents
that support you.

399
00:15:27,576 --> 00:15:30,078
And my dad is a dentist.

400
00:15:30,145 --> 00:15:32,197
He thinks my dream
is unreasonable

401
00:15:32,281 --> 00:15:33,448
and insane.
You know what,

402
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:34,449
he's right.

403
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,167
I don't know the first thing

404
00:15:36,252 --> 00:15:39,153
about getting a recording
contract or a manager.

405
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:41,389
The cream always rises
to the top, Mercedes.

406
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:43,324
Yeah, I'm cream in here,
Mr. Shue.

407
00:15:43,392 --> 00:15:49,464
But what if, out there,
I'm just... skim milk?

408
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,560
(bell ringing)

409
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,351
You should talk to him.
Help him.

410
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:11,619
He called me spoiled and
self-centered, okay.

411
00:16:11,687 --> 00:16:13,404
He can come to me
and talk to me first.

412
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:15,874
That's a great way
to start a marriage.

413
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:23,832
So what's up, dude?
We doing this L.A.
thing or what?

414
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:25,300
'Cause I had to go
apartment-shopping.

415
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:27,302
And if I get a one-bedroom,
you're screwed.

416
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:29,420
Two dudes in one bed
is like confirmed gay.

417
00:16:29,505 --> 00:16:30,805
I can't.

418
00:16:30,873 --> 00:16:32,507
Look, that's your dream,
not mine. Uh...

419
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:33,675
Dude, I can't go
without you.

420
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:34,926
You're my best friend.

421
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,344
You can do anything
without me, man, okay?

422
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,846
You never needed me before.

423
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:39,848
Yeah, but if you're
there with me,

424
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,150
then that big city
won't seem so... scary.

425
00:16:42,217 --> 00:16:43,718
Scary?

426
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,653
Scary? Nothing
scares you, man.

427
00:16:45,721 --> 00:16:48,690
Your five-mile ride on top
of Mrs. Witt's Chrysler

428
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,609
is still a car-surfing
record, okay.

429
00:16:51,694 --> 00:16:55,563
Seriously, just... you'll have
that place wired in no time.

430
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:59,334
So if you're not going with me,
what are you going to do?

431
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:01,202
(sighs)
I still really don't know.

432
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,074
Well, do me
one favor, would you?

433
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,259
When you do find your dream,

434
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:10,378
make it as big as you are.

435
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,797
I don't know much,
but I know this.

436
00:17:12,882 --> 00:17:15,350
You owe it to yourself.

437
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:17,268
And now you owe it to me.

438
00:17:22,423 --> 00:17:22,423
+

439
00:17:23,778 --> 00:17:25,312
Porcelain, Wheezy, have a seat.

440
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:28,865
Traitors.

441
00:17:28,933 --> 00:17:30,367
What are you talking about?

442
00:17:30,434 --> 00:17:32,602
As you may as well know,
I have a large portion

443
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:34,287
of this school bugged
and wiretapped.

444
00:17:34,355 --> 00:17:38,375
I am already pushing the
very limits of physics

445
00:17:38,442 --> 00:17:40,276
by joining forces
with Will Schuester.

446
00:17:40,328 --> 00:17:42,712
And you repay my help

447
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,714
by giving tips to the enemy?

448
00:17:44,782 --> 00:17:46,800
Oh, no, that's not
what happened at all.

449
00:17:46,884 --> 00:17:50,136
Wade was asking us for advice,
because he wants to wear a dress

450
00:17:50,204 --> 00:17:51,638
and perform
at Regionals

451
00:17:51,722 --> 00:17:53,056
as his alter ego Unique,

452
00:17:53,123 --> 00:17:54,724
an-and we didn't think
it was a very good idea.

453
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:55,959
It's not a good idea.

454
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,644
It's a great idea.

455
00:17:57,728 --> 00:17:59,596
But Coach Sylvester,
this is Ohio.

456
00:17:59,647 --> 00:18:02,315
I don't think many people
are gonna be down with that.

457
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,416
Exactly.

458
00:18:03,484 --> 00:18:05,268
He'll tank them
at Regionals.

459
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:09,155
And then New Directions will
coast to a win at Nationals.

460
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,141
I happen to have a pair
of 13 wides right here.

461
00:18:12,193 --> 00:18:14,244
Where did you get those?

462
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:16,446
They were autographed
by my good friend Janet Reno.

463
00:18:16,497 --> 00:18:18,582
And she wore them on the day
they caught the Unabomber.

464
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:20,584
Deliver these
unto Unique.

465
00:18:20,651 --> 00:18:22,302
Get him to cram his hamhocks

466
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,170
into these platoons
at Regionals,

467
00:18:24,238 --> 00:18:27,707
and we'll be well on our way
to a National Championship.

Incredible.

And I could see exactly
where you were going with it.

508
00:20:03,054 --> 00:20:05,522
This was more than just a
beautiful love song to Brittany.

509
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:07,641
It's also a powerful way
to convey your dream

510
00:20:07,725 --> 00:20:09,843
that marriage equality
will someday be a reality

511
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,561
for everyone,
and you're off

512
00:20:11,612 --> 00:20:13,446
to law school to make it happen!
Amazing.

513
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:14,948
Of course
I want marriage equality.

514
00:20:15,032 --> 00:20:16,950
And yeah, Brittany will
always be my girlfriend.

515
00:20:17,034 --> 00:20:19,369
Score!
But my mistress is fame.

516
00:20:19,436 --> 00:20:23,106
And that song was all about how
I can't live withouts my fame.

517
00:20:23,157 --> 00:20:24,874
Then I'll have to say
I'm disappointed in you.

518
00:20:24,942 --> 00:20:26,910
Fame is not something
to aspire to.

519
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:28,945
How about you save the lecture
for the theatre nerds

520
00:20:28,996 --> 00:20:30,413
that are gonna starve
in New York

521
00:20:30,464 --> 00:20:32,165
while desperately trying
to tap-dance their way

522
00:20:32,249 --> 00:20:33,583
<i>into the chorus of Godspell?</i>

523
00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:34,751
No offence, Gayberry.

524
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:36,970
And everyone can
stop their hating,

525
00:20:37,054 --> 00:20:38,221
because you all want
to be famous, too.

526
00:20:38,288 --> 00:20:39,305
The only difference is

527
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,307
that I'm a thousand percent sure

528
00:20:41,392 --> 00:20:43,326
that I'm actually
going to be famous,

529
00:20:43,394 --> 00:20:44,728
just like I'm a thousand

530
00:20:44,795 --> 00:20:46,513
percent sure that
our Man/Child piano player

531
00:20:46,597 --> 00:20:49,232
keeps a petite Eurasian locked
in a trunk underneath his bed.

532
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:50,183
Sorry, James.

533
00:20:50,267 --> 00:20:51,151
Write this down--

534
00:20:51,235 --> 00:20:52,652
'cause there will
be a quiz--

535
00:20:52,737 --> 00:20:53,970
<i>I'm gonna be famous.</i>

536
00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:55,805
If it's the last thing I do.

537
00:20:59,744 --> 00:21:01,611
(footsteps approaching)

538
00:21:02,863 --> 00:21:03,997
I got your tweet.

539
00:21:04,081 --> 00:21:05,665
"Anyone who's engaged to me

540
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,200
should come to the auditorium."

541
00:21:07,284 --> 00:21:09,335
You could've just texted.

542
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,088
Yeah, but I wasn't sure
if we were speaking.

543
00:21:12,156 --> 00:21:14,207
I miss you.

544
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,324
I miss you, too.

545
00:21:17,661 --> 00:21:20,130
Now I feel like I'm finally
reentering my body.

546
00:21:20,181 --> 00:21:22,599
I really don't like
not talking to you.

547
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,768
I mean, nothing feels real
unless you're there
to tell it to.

548
00:21:24,835 --> 00:21:26,436
I never realized how much
time we spent talking.

549
00:21:26,503 --> 00:21:29,222
I've been thinking, and if you
don't want to go to New York,

550
00:21:29,306 --> 00:21:30,356
then we don't have to.

551
00:21:30,441 --> 00:21:32,942
Wh... Wh... That's crazy.

552
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,894
I don't want to stand
in the way of your dreams.

553
00:21:34,979 --> 00:21:37,847
Look, the only reason why
we've been focusing on my dreams

554
00:21:37,898 --> 00:21:40,850
is because we haven't taken
the time to look into yours.

555
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:42,685
What if your dreams
are bigger than mine?

556
00:21:42,737 --> 00:21:44,353
I don't think that's
going to be a problem.

557
00:21:44,405 --> 00:21:46,355
I mean, I did one of
those quizzes online

558
00:21:46,407 --> 00:21:48,691
that was supposed to tell you
what job you'd be good at,

559
00:21:48,743 --> 00:21:50,577
and my results were
"competitive eating champion."

560
00:21:50,661 --> 00:21:52,162
Okay, sit down.

561
00:21:54,131 --> 00:21:57,300
My whole life, I felt like
I was in the wrong place.

562
00:21:57,367 --> 00:22:00,970
Like I was just some alien,
an-and... no one understood me.

563
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:02,722
But all I had to do was just

564
00:22:02,807 --> 00:22:04,140
go to New York.

565
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,541
Go home to Broadway,

566
00:22:05,593 --> 00:22:08,011
and then everything
would be fine.

567
00:22:08,062 --> 00:22:09,429
But I was wrong.

568
00:22:09,513 --> 00:22:14,150
My home isn't some place,
it's... someone.

569
00:22:14,218 --> 00:22:15,485
It's you.

570
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:18,822
Of course, I want us
to go to New York,

571
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:21,441
and... maybe we will.

572
00:22:21,525 --> 00:22:24,027
But not until we give
your dreams an equal shot.

573
00:22:26,897 --> 00:22:29,165
You love me that much?

574
00:22:29,233 --> 00:22:31,234
Are you just figuring
that out now?

575
00:22:31,285 --> 00:22:33,670
So, can I please
sing to you about it?

576
00:22:33,737 --> 00:22:35,588
I mean, it's from the movie,
and it's really good.

577
00:22:35,673 --> 00:22:37,073
Do I have a choice?

578
00:22:37,124 --> 00:22:39,259
Well, you know,
I kind of planned
No choice.

579
00:22:39,343 --> 00:22:40,877
the whole singing thing
first, just in case

580
00:22:40,928 --> 00:22:42,462
you took a little convincing.

581
00:22:42,546 --> 00:22:45,215
I mean, I'd hate for
it to go to waste.

582

This pile, uh,
is places in Ohio

615
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:47,170
that you actually have a shot
at an athletic scholarship,

616
00:24:47,221 --> 00:24:48,888
so you hang onto those.

617
00:24:48,973 --> 00:24:50,390
And then these
are the ones

618
00:24:50,474 --> 00:24:52,175
with the, uh,
cool glossy papers

619
00:24:52,226 --> 00:24:53,893
that you got excited about.

620
00:24:53,978 --> 00:24:55,895
Mm-hmm!
It's a lot to go through.

621
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,764
Yeah. I mean,
what do you think, Finn?

622
00:24:57,848 --> 00:25:00,233
Think your dream is
hidden in there somewhere?

623
00:25:00,317 --> 00:25:01,734
I don't know.
This is a lot of choices.

624
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:02,902
Well, there's no rush.

625
00:25:02,987 --> 00:25:04,570
I mean, there's a little,
you know, rush,

626
00:25:04,655 --> 00:25:06,055
because the applications
are due soon,

627
00:25:06,106 --> 00:25:07,690
and, well, I mean,
there's the whole

628
00:25:07,741 --> 00:25:08,908
we need to figure out

629
00:25:08,993 --> 00:25:10,276
where we're gonna begin
our lives thing, but

630
00:25:10,361 --> 00:25:12,428
there's no rush.

631
00:25:13,497 --> 00:25:14,447
Okay.

632
00:25:14,531 --> 00:25:15,698
Well, I guess I just need to

633
00:25:15,749 --> 00:25:17,500
take some time
with these by myself,

634
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:19,235
and see if I can, you know,

635
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:22,005
shake a dream
out of here somehow.
EMMA:
It's in there.

636
00:25:22,072 --> 00:25:23,906
Okay.

637
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:25,574
Hey, uh...

638
00:25:25,626 --> 00:25:26,676
Thanks.

639
00:25:26,743 --> 00:25:27,877
All of you.

640
00:25:30,214 --> 00:25:31,080
Hey, Finn...

641
00:25:32,749 --> 00:25:34,183
We believe in you.

642
00:25:34,251 --> 00:25:36,085
Thanks.

643
00:25:50,701 --> 00:25:52,568
(bell ringing)

644
00:26:00,878 --> 00:26:02,628
Santana, watching
"Two Girls One Cat"

645
00:26:02,713 --> 00:26:04,280
was like staring into
the face of God.

646
00:26:04,331 --> 00:26:05,948
Thank you.
New favorite movie.

647
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,950
Why is everyone staring
at me like I'm Finn

648
00:26:08,002 --> 00:26:09,618
and I just won
a butter-eating competition?

649
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:12,472
It's because you're famous.

650
00:26:12,556 --> 00:26:14,790
Everybody's loving the sex tape
of us I posted on the Internet.

651
00:26:14,842 --> 00:26:17,510
What?! Brittany, that
sex tape was private.

652
00:26:17,594 --> 00:26:19,095
We made that for us.

653
00:26:19,146 --> 00:26:21,180
No, I know, but I spliced it
together with a video of

654
00:26:21,265 --> 00:26:22,648
Lord Tubbington performing
everyday household chores.

655
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:24,434
(meows)

656
00:26:24,485 --> 00:26:25,601
Why would you do that?

657
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:27,236
'Cause you said you
wanted to be famous.

658
00:26:27,304 --> 00:26:29,305
So I looked up all
the famous people that I knew,

659
00:26:29,356 --> 00:26:30,806
and they all have sex tapes.

660
00:26:30,858 --> 00:26:32,358
So I put ours out there.

661
00:26:32,443 --> 00:26:34,160
I'm really excited
about it!

662
00:26:36,413 --> 00:26:38,614
(meows)

663
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:41,768
+

664
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:44,667
(bell ringing)
Come with me.

665
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:53,576
What, are you going through
the garbage now?

666
00:26:53,627 --> 00:26:56,379
Oh, come on. I know you were
just humoring us in there.

667
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,598
I could see it in your face.
So I followed you out.

668
00:26:58,682 --> 00:27:01,134
What was I supposed to say, man?

669
00:27:01,218 --> 00:27:02,685
S-Sorry, I'd rather puke

670
00:27:02,752 --> 00:27:04,554
than spend a minute in
any of those places?

671
00:27:04,605 --> 00:27:07,056
Right in front of
Rachel, with...

672
00:27:07,107 --> 00:27:09,225
a big smile on her face,
all proud of herself?

673
00:27:09,276 --> 00:27:10,259
She just wants
what's best for you.

674
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,477
Yeah, she does.

675
00:27:11,562 --> 00:27:13,196
Until she realizes her
fiancé is a total loser.

676
00:27:13,263 --> 00:27:14,480
Is that what you're scared of?

677
00:27:14,565 --> 00:27:16,149
It's the truth.

678
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:18,067
Doesn't anybody understand that

679
00:27:18,118 --> 00:27:20,570
maybe the reason I don't know
what to do with my life

680
00:27:20,621 --> 00:27:22,905
is because I'm not
qualified to do anything.

681
00:27:22,956 --> 00:27:24,040
You just don't know
what you want yet.

682
00:27:24,107 --> 00:27:25,658
What I want is for time to stop.

683
00:27:25,742 --> 00:27:27,210
Okay?

684
00:27:27,277 --> 00:27:29,412
I want it to feel like
I'm on the football field

685
00:27:29,463 --> 00:27:31,297
and the crowd's going nuts!

686
00:27:31,381 --> 00:27:33,549
Or I-I want it to feel
like I'm on the stage

687
00:27:33,617 --> 00:27:35,168
during a performance, and
everybody's on their feet.

688
00:27:35,252 --> 00:27:36,502
So let's find
something out there

689
00:27:36,587 --> 00:27:38,754
that gives you that feeling.
Of being young?

690
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,841
Where is it?

691
00:27:41,925 --> 00:27:43,125
Show me.

692
00:27:52,853 --> 00:27:54,520
I want you to watch this for me.

693
00:27:54,605 --> 00:27:56,355
Look, Mr. Shue,
I don't really feel like doing

694
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,074
my Glee homework right now,
I just...

695
00:27:58,141 --> 00:28:00,776
I think you know what
you want for your life.

696
00:28:00,827 --> 00:28:03,496
I think you're just scared
to say it out loud.

697
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,481
I want you to see
what it looks like

698
00:28:05,532 --> 00:28:06,699
when someone follows
their dream,

699
00:28:06,783 --> 00:28:08,417
even though everyone else

700

701
00:28:09,953 --> 00:28:12,588
You can do anything
you want to, Finn.

702
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:16,008
It's not the broken dreams
that break us.

703
00:28:17,678 --> 00:28:19,378
It's the ones we
didn't dare to dream.

I love you, Santana Lopez.

709
00:28:37,281 --> 00:28:39,065
Awesome, right?

710
00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:41,317
Don't thank me
for your new fame.

711
00:28:41,368 --> 00:28:43,686
You know, it didn't really
cross my mind to thank you.

712
00:28:43,737 --> 00:28:46,572
Yeah, well, you say the dream,
and I help build your dream.

713
00:28:46,657 --> 00:28:48,241
And that's what
a partnership is about, right?

714
00:28:48,325 --> 00:28:50,042
Listen, Britt,
I totally understand

715
00:28:50,127 --> 00:28:51,527
how you could think
that you were helping me,

716
00:28:51,578 --> 00:28:53,412
but you gotta
take the video down.

717
00:28:53,497 --> 00:28:55,164
No way! Now that we just
got your boob in the door,

718
00:28:55,215 --> 00:28:56,582
we can't rest.

719
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:58,000
I came up with an idea

720
00:28:58,051 --> 00:28:59,835
that will make you,
like, Snooki famous,

721
00:28:59,886 --> 00:29:01,804
but without all
the blackout drinking.

722
00:29:01,871 --> 00:29:03,339
We need to book you
on a reality TV gig ASAP.

723
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:05,725
So I've narrowed it down
to a few possibilities.

724
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:08,177
Number one: I see how
you keep your car,

725
00:29:08,228 --> 00:29:09,762
<i>so you could totally
be on Hoarders.</i>

726
00:29:09,846 --> 00:29:11,681
You just need to start storing
your poops in the trunk,

727
00:29:11,732 --> 00:29:13,149
and I'm sure they'll book you.

728
00:29:13,216 --> 00:29:14,517
No. Brittany,
I can't do that.

729
00:29:14,568 --> 00:29:16,068
Well, you have to,
if you want to be on the show.

730
00:29:16,153 --> 00:29:19,021
Or... this is
my favorite one.

731
00:29:19,072 --> 00:29:21,223
You can eat that.
It's a bull testicle.

732
00:29:21,275 --> 00:29:23,409
I drove all the way to
Spencerville to get it.

733
00:29:23,493 --> 00:29:24,577
You know, it came with a pair,

734
00:29:24,661 --> 00:29:25,894
but I got hungry on
the way home, so...

735
00:29:25,946 --> 00:29:26,895
It tastes just like
a chicken testicle.

736
00:29:26,947 --> 00:29:28,230
I don't get it.

737
00:29:28,282 --> 00:29:29,732
<i>It's for Fear Factor.</i>

738
00:29:29,783 --> 00:29:31,867
If you want to be famous,
you have to eat crazy stuff.

739
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,838
Just let me know how far
you're willing to go for fame.

740
00:29:35,905 --> 00:29:37,673
It's up to you.

741
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,044

742
00:29:42,095 --> 00:29:44,430
I feel horrible.

743
00:29:44,514 --> 00:29:46,248
We should never have
given Wade those high heels.

744
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,916
Look, there's still
time to stop it.

745
00:29:47,968 --> 00:29:50,136
I mean, he wouldn't
actually go out like that.

746
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,304
Would he?

747
00:29:51,388 --> 00:29:52,855
Well, Finn dressed up
like Lady Gaga,

748
00:29:52,922 --> 00:29:55,391
and I never thought
that would happen.

749
00:29:55,442 --> 00:29:57,693
KURT:
Oh, thank God.

750
00:29:57,761 --> 00:29:59,812
Hey, Wade!
We just came by to

751
00:29:59,896 --> 00:30:01,480
tell you to break a leg.

752
00:30:01,565 --> 00:30:02,898
And to make sure you're
still dressed as a guy.

753
00:30:02,949 --> 00:30:04,483
Not for long.

754
00:30:04,568 --> 00:30:07,036
Look, Wade, I know we
sent you those shoes

755
00:30:07,103 --> 00:30:08,537
as a good-luck gesture, but

756
00:30:08,605 --> 00:30:11,240
w-we talked it over,
and you can't do this.

757
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:14,994
I admit that I've worn some
flamboyant designer outfits,

758
00:30:15,078 --> 00:30:16,796
but I've never dressed up
like a woman.

759
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,215
That's because you
identify yourself as a man.

760
00:30:20,884 --> 00:30:22,785
I thought you, of all people,
would understand.

761
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,954
I'm wearing them.

We're friends of Wade's.

That was incredible!

879
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,592
That was amazing!

880
00:35:27,643 --> 00:35:28,593
You're definitely gonna
win the prize.

881
00:35:28,644 --> 00:35:30,128
I already did.

882
00:35:30,179 --> 00:35:31,296
But look, there's more.

883
00:35:31,347 --> 00:35:34,132
I figured out what
I'm gonna do next year.

884
00:35:34,183 --> 00:35:35,650
Can we sit down?

885
00:35:35,735 --> 00:35:38,469
Ay, why am I nervous?

886
00:35:38,521 --> 00:35:39,771
Don't be nervous.

887
00:35:41,524 --> 00:35:43,275
<i>Mr. Shue made me watch
Saturday Night Fever.</i>

888
00:35:43,326 --> 00:35:44,743
It was really good,

889
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:47,329
and I realized I'm a lot
like Tony Manero.

890
00:35:47,413 --> 00:35:49,781
Except for the whole
being-able-to-dance thing.

891
00:35:49,832 --> 00:35:51,950
When I saw that movie,
I realized the way

892
00:35:52,001 --> 00:35:53,251
that Tony took on the world...

893
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:56,037
I want to do that, too.

894
00:35:56,122 --> 00:35:57,289
I want to move to New York.

895
00:35:57,356 --> 00:36:00,208
Like Tony. Like you.

896
00:36:00,293 --> 00:36:01,793
I want to live
in New York City with you.

897
00:36:01,844 --> 00:36:02,711
Really?

898
00:36:02,795 --> 00:36:03,628
Yeah.
Are you serious?!

899
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:04,679
Yeah.

900
00:36:04,764 --> 00:36:06,298
I knew it.

901
00:36:06,349 --> 00:36:08,383
I'm gonna make you
really happy, I promise.

902
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:09,500
Just... there's more.

903
00:36:09,552 --> 00:36:11,336
Just wait. Uh,

904
00:36:11,387 --> 00:36:12,854
what was that acting show,
on Bravo,

905
00:36:12,939 --> 00:36:15,473
with the swear words and the
cool dude you made me watch?

906
00:36:15,524 --> 00:36:16,891
James Lipton.

907
00:36:16,976 --> 00:36:18,560
Yeah.
I applied to his school.

908
00:36:18,644 --> 00:36:21,146
I want to go
to Inside the Actors' Studio.

909
00:36:21,197 --> 00:36:24,532
It's... It's just
"The Actors' Studio,"

910
00:36:24,617 --> 00:36:26,151
but that's great.

911
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:27,953
It's a perfect,
perfect fit for you.

912
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,956
You just, you know, you can't...
do this for me, all right?

913
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:32,690
It has to be for you.

914
00:36:32,742 --> 00:36:35,460
It's too much pressure
for me to handle.

915
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:38,029
It is for you, but it's
also what I want.

916
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:40,031
It's my dream.

917
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:42,050
I want to be an actor.

918
00:36:43,636 --> 00:36:45,536
I guess I was always afraid
to admit it

919
00:36:45,588 --> 00:36:47,339
because I was scared of failing,

920
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:49,507
but I'm not scared anymore...

921
00:36:49,558 --> 00:36:50,759
'cause of you.

922
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:54,579
I want to be a great man
for you, Rachel.

923
00:36:54,647 --> 00:36:59,517
And I want to see myself
the way you see me;

924
00:36:59,568 --> 00:37:02,187
like I'm capable of anything.

925
00:37:02,254 --> 00:37:03,905
Dreaming big.

926
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,492
I love you so much...

927
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:08,994
and you deserve that.

928
00:37:12,114 --> 00:37:13,898
You're my hero;
you know that, right?

929
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:16,534
You're mine.

930
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:21,039
I cannot believe
Unique pulled that off.

931
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:22,173
There's something
to be said

932
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:23,375
about the power
of a dream.

933
00:37:23,426 --> 00:37:24,959
Mm-hmm.

934
00:37:25,044 --> 00:37:26,744
He took a risk
and it paid off.

935
00:37:26,796 --> 00:37:29,747
But I guess that's just
having a dream.

936
00:37:29,799 --> 00:37:30,598
SAM:
Hey, Mercedes.

937
00:37:32,635 --> 00:37:34,019
I know we haven't
talked much,

938
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:36,888
but I have something
that I need to show you.

939
00:37:36,939 --> 00:37:38,223
No more songs, Sam.

940
00:37:38,274 --> 00:37:39,691
One more.

941
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,693
Don't worry. This time I'm not
the one singing.

942
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,146
♪ Burn, baby, burn... ♪

943
00:37:45,231 --> 00:37:46,931
That's me.

944
00:37:46,982 --> 00:37:48,366
Yeah.

945
00:37:48,434 --> 00:37:50,869
Wait-- did you post this
to YouTube without asking?

946
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:52,404
Can you hear yourself?

947
00:37:52,455 --> 00:37:56,291
You're amazing,
and you look stunning.

948
00:37:59,578 --> 00:38:01,379
485 comments?

949
00:38:01,447 --> 00:38:02,664
Mm, I can't look.

950
00:38:02,748 --> 00:38:05,467
No. Look.

951
00:38:05,551 --> 00:38:07,252
484 of them are positive.

952
00:38:07,303 --> 00:38:09,620
One of them
was disappointed

953
00:38:09,672 --> 00:38:13,124
because they thought
"Mercedes Inferno"
was a car-fail video.

954
00:38:13,175 --> 00:38:17,295
I can't believe
you did this for me.

955
00:38:17,346 --> 00:38:18,646
Why?

956
00:38:18,731 --> 00:38:23,518
Because I believe in you and
what you could become.

957
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:26,871
Now complete strangers
believe in you, too.

958
00:38:26,939 --> 00:38:30,475
You just need to find a way out
to L.A. and do your thing.

959
00:38:30,526 --> 00:38:31,809
It's time for this dream

960
00:38:31,861 --> 00:38:33,495
to stop being a dream
and become a reality.

961
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:35,413
Listen to them.

962
00:38:35,481 --> 00:38:37,582
They all want to buy
your album, and so do I.

963
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,851
You ain't no skim milk, baby.

964
00:38:41,704 --> 00:38:43,988
You're the cream
rising to the top.

965
00:38:50,229 --> 00:38:50,229
+

966
00:38:51,115 --> 00:38:52,332
(bell ringing)

967
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,201
Boobs Magoo,
words simply cannot describe

968
00:38:54,252 --> 00:38:55,619
how disappointed
I am in you.

969
00:38:55,703 --> 00:38:57,904
And look at
poor Brittany.

970
00:38:57,956 --> 00:38:59,623
Her chagrin is limited
only by the fact

971
00:38:59,707 --> 00:39:01,008
that she has a brain

972
00:39:01,075 --> 00:39:02,709
the size of a toddler's fist.

973
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,094
I can show you
the MRI.

974
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:06,847
And it's not just the sex tape.

975
00:39:06,914 --> 00:39:09,516
My goodness, sex tapes
are a dime a dozen these days.

976
00:39:09,584 --> 00:39:12,269
I myself made a sex tape
with Oliver North.

977
00:39:13,771 --> 00:39:15,556
Wasn't very popular,
probably because

978
00:39:15,623 --> 00:39:16,723
we released it
on Betamax.

979
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:18,809
I think Cheney still has a copy.

980
00:39:18,877 --> 00:39:21,361
What's so disappointing
is not that you want
to be famous,

981
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:23,247
it's that you don't care
how you get there.

982
00:39:23,314 --> 00:39:24,731
I see that now.

983
00:39:24,782 --> 00:39:27,067
I'm embarrassed I've
been so shortsighted.

984
00:39:27,118 --> 00:39:29,736
I want to make
something of my life.

985
00:39:29,787 --> 00:39:32,706
I want to do something
of substance with it.

986
00:39:32,773 --> 00:39:34,441
And yes, I do want
to go to college.

987
00:39:34,492 --> 00:39:36,610
One step ahead of you,
Lady Ta-Ta.

988
00:39:36,661 --> 00:39:38,128
What is this?

989
00:39:38,213 --> 00:39:39,296
That is an acceptance letter.

990
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,164
You got a full ride

991
00:39:41,249 --> 00:39:43,283
from the University
of Louisville.
It's in Louisville.

992
00:39:43,334 --> 00:39:45,669
It's the nation's top
cheerleading program

993
00:39:45,753 --> 00:39:46,970
and you got a full
scholarship.

994
00:39:47,055 --> 00:39:49,139
Now, I know you don't want
to be a cheerleader

995
00:39:49,224 --> 00:39:50,724
for the rest of your life.

996
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:52,959
But this will get you
a foot in the door.

997
00:39:53,011 --> 00:39:54,678
Maybe you can get
a business degree;

998
00:39:54,746 --> 00:39:57,848
open up a taco truck.

999
00:39:57,932 --> 00:39:59,650
I'm still somewhat confused
about your ethnicity.

1000
00:39:59,734 --> 00:40:02,769
I don't know what to say.

1001
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,004
Thank you.

1002
00:40:04,072 --> 00:40:04,988
Well, don't thank me.

1003
00:40:05,073 --> 00:40:06,189
Brittany thought of it.

1004
00:40:06,274 --> 00:40:08,275
She gets an idea once
every couple of years,

1005
00:40:08,326 --> 00:40:10,661
and lucky for us
this was a good one.

1006
00:40:10,745 --> 00:40:11,945
Thank you.

1007
00:40:13,814 --> 00:40:16,783
I don't know if this is
100% the answer for me,

1008
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:18,485
but just to know that
I have somebody

1009
00:40:18,553 --> 00:40:22,706
who believes in me
as much as you do.

1010
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,491
I love you so much.

1011
00:40:25,927 --> 00:40:27,377
I love you, too.

1012
00:40:29,213 --> 00:40:31,014
(bell ringing)

1013
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:32,799
Come on, who won, Mr. Shue?
Who gets the suit?

1014
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,518
Well, I left that
up to Sue.

1015
00:40:34,602 --> 00:40:36,836
And if there's one thing I enjoy

1016
00:40:36,888 --> 00:40:38,305
more than punishing
you lazy idiots...

1017
00:40:38,356 --> 00:40:39,673
it's rewarding you
for being

1018
00:40:39,724 --> 00:40:41,058
slightly less lazy
and idiotic.

1019
00:40:41,142 --> 00:40:43,644
Will the winners please enter?

1020
00:40:43,695 --> 00:40:46,780
(all cheering, whooping)

1021
00:40:46,847 --> 00:40:48,198
Even in polyester,

1022
00:40:48,283 --> 00:40:50,067
I feel like a million
bucks in this.

1023
00:40:50,151 --> 00:40:51,068
So what now?

1024
00:40:51,152 --> 00:40:52,819
What do you want to do?

1025
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,521
You know what I want to do?
What?

1026
00:40:54,572 --> 00:40:56,406
I said, do you
know what I want to do?!

1027
00:40:56,491 --> 00:40:57,524
ALL:
What?

1028
00:40:57,575 --> 00:40:59,159
Strut.
