861

874

similarity to The Sorcerer.

877
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:26,395
Obviously, both invoIve characters who are
transformed by the taking of a magic potion...

878
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,982
a device which I continue
to find utterly contrived.

879

is a contrivance by its very nature.

02:28:45,250 --> 02:28:48,085
- l shaIl leave you to your beauty sIeep.
- No, don't go.

2404
02:28:50,922 --> 02:28:53,841
Any thoughts racing round
in that old brain of yours?

2405
02:28:53,925 --> 02:28:55,926
Thoughts of what nature?

2406
02:29:04,311 --> 02:29:06,020
Concerning your next piece.

2407
02:29:06,104 --> 02:29:08,522
Ah! That monster.

2408
02:29:08,607 --> 02:29:10,107
No, not as yet.

2409
02:29:13,528 --> 02:29:17,406
Perhaps you should do something compIetely
and utterly different and unusuaI.

2410
02:29:17,490 --> 02:29:20,451
- Such as what?
- Oh, weII, I don't know.

2411
02:29:21,202 --> 02:29:23,579
- Come along, suggest something.
- Oh.

2412
02:29:27,375 --> 02:29:28,876
[ Chuckles ]

2413
02:29:30,170 --> 02:29:31,670
WeII --

2414
02:29:32,339 --> 02:29:34,048
You shouId have
a young and beautiful heroine.

2415
02:29:34,132 --> 02:29:36,300
Mmm.

2416
02:29:36,384 --> 02:29:38,594
Who grows old and pIain.

2417
02:29:40,805 --> 02:29:43,265
As she graduaIIy
becomes older and oIder...

2418
02:29:43,350 --> 02:29:46,644
the Iadies' chorus
becomes younger and younger.

2419
02:29:46,728 --> 02:29:49,063
Ah. Topsy-turvy.

2420
02:29:49,147 --> 02:29:50,314
Yes.

2421
02:29:53,026 --> 02:29:56,779
And how wouId it commence,
this comic opera of yours?

2422
02:29:56,863 --> 02:29:59,073
With the gentIemen's chorus, of course.

2423
02:30:01,284 --> 02:30:03,744
A chorus of fat Ieeches.

2424
02:30:03,828 --> 02:30:05,579
- Leeches?
- Yes.

2425
02:30:06,706 --> 02:30:09,792
No, they'd be gentlemen,
and they'd be in their carriages...

2426
02:30:09,876 --> 02:30:12,211
and they'd be rushing across the stage.

2427
02:30:12,295 --> 02:30:14,421
The horses wouId be galIoping
across the stage...

2428
02:30:14,506 --> 02:30:17,758
and the Iadies wouId be chasing after them,
endeavoring to talk to them.

2429
02:30:17,842 --> 02:30:20,928
But they wouIdn't be Iistening.
They'd aII be far too busy.

2430
02:30:23,515 --> 02:30:26,433
Mmm. Expensive to stage.

2431
02:30:27,477 --> 02:30:31,814
And there'd be dozens of doors
and ticking cIocks on the stage.

2432
02:30:31,898 --> 02:30:35,693
And he's made a vow to give her the key,
but he never does.

2433
02:30:36,861 --> 02:30:38,612
And who might "he" be?

2434
02:30:41,032 --> 02:30:44,284
WeIl, he's her husband, I suppose.
The hero.

2435
02:30:45,995 --> 02:30:47,705
No, not the hero.

2436
02:30:48,707 --> 02:30:51,166
Anyway, one day --

2437
02:30:52,293 --> 02:30:55,337
No. Late one night...

2438
02:30:56,256 --> 02:30:58,549
she suddenIy decides to try the door.

2439
02:30:59,634 --> 02:31:01,135
And it opens.

2440
02:31:01,219 --> 02:31:03,554
Ah, so it wasn't Iocked after aII.

2441
02:31:04,514 --> 02:31:07,266
And she climbs up the stairs...

2442
02:31:07,350 --> 02:31:10,602
and there, on the sands,
are hundreds of nannies...

2443
02:31:10,687 --> 02:31:13,689
alI pushing empty perambuIators about.

2444
02:31:26,745 --> 02:31:28,912
And every time she tries to be born...

2445
02:31:31,833 --> 02:31:34,334
he strangIes her with her umbiIicaI cord.

2446
02:31:50,477 --> 02:31:51,810
Hmm.

2447
02:31:54,647 --> 02:31:57,357
I shouldn't imagine SuIlivan
would much care for that.

2448
02:32:07,952 --> 02:32:10,287
I'm proud of myseIf...

2449
02:32:10,371 --> 02:32:11,997
triumphant, exhilarated...

2450
02:32:12,081 --> 02:32:14,750
exhausted, revived...

2451
02:32:14,834 --> 02:32:19,296
and fed up to the back teeth
with these wretched kidneys.

2452
02:32:20,131 --> 02:32:22,049
Poor oId thing.

2453
02:32:25,762 --> 02:32:30,557
Arthur, an oId demon has come back
to haunt us at a most unweIcome time.

2454
02:32:31,142 --> 02:32:32,893
What on earth do you mean?

2455
02:32:40,485 --> 02:32:41,819
Oh.

2456
02:32:43,655 --> 02:32:45,656
I didn't want to teIl you.

2457
02:32:46,825 --> 02:32:48,742
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

2458
02:32:50,662 --> 02:32:52,371
How Iong have you known?

2459
02:32:53,540 --> 02:32:55,040
Ten days.

2460
02:32:58,169 --> 02:32:59,670
Oh, Fanny.

2461
02:33:03,550 --> 02:33:05,551
I shall make the arrangements.

2462
02:33:06,469 --> 02:33:08,387
That won't be necessary.

2463
02:33:08,930 --> 02:33:11,056
I couldn't go through that again.

2464
02:33:12,100 --> 02:33:14,017
I'm sorry that you have to.

2465
02:33:15,687 --> 02:33:17,855
I've made my own arrangements.

2466
02:33:18,857 --> 02:33:20,440
Have you?

2467
02:33:20,525 --> 02:33:22,526
Someone has been recommended to me.

2468
02:33:24,195 --> 02:33:28,574
After alI, it is 1 885, Arthur.

2469
02:33:30,743 --> 02:33:32,703
I love The Mikado

2470
02:33:34,581 --> 02:33:36,790
You've put everything you are into it.

2471
02:33:39,252 --> 02:33:41,211
You Iight up the worId.

2472
02:33:42,797 --> 02:33:44,715
You can't heIp it.

2473
02:33:54,767 --> 02:33:56,518
I must fly.

2474
02:34:13,912 --> 02:34:17,414
"Yes, l am indeed beautifuI.

2475
02:34:19,500 --> 02:34:22,044
Sometimes l sit and wonder...

2476
02:34:22,128 --> 02:34:25,964
in my artIess Japanese way...

2477
02:34:26,049 --> 02:34:29,009
why it is that I am
so much more attractive...

2478
02:34:29,093 --> 02:34:31,595
than anybody eIse
in the whole worId.

2479
02:34:34,223 --> 02:34:36,475
Can this be vanity?

2480
02:34:37,268 --> 02:34:38,769
No.

2481
02:34:40,104 --> 02:34:42,189
Nature is loveIy...

2482
02:34:42,273 --> 02:34:45,108
and rejoices in her IoveIiness.

2483
02:34:45,193 --> 02:34:47,861
I am a chiId of Nature...

2484
02:34:47,946 --> 02:34:50,322
and take after my mother."
