1
00:00:56,156 --> 00:01:00,991
In a palanquin, the bride...

2
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:07,332
is brought to her
husband's door

3
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:20,675
There'sjoy in the heart

4
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:26,343
A thousand dreams she dreams

5
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:33,118
In the palanquin...

6
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:14,666
I had to leave my husband's house,
after I died

7
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:19,671
But I had to leave nevertheless

8
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:24,941
In tender feet...

9
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:28,176
there are boils

10
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:33,012
On thorns, I have to tread

11
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:46,861
Spring has turned into autumn

12
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:53,367
In a palanquin...

13
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:28,670
For all the tears
my eyes shed...

14
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:34,010
I have been tormented too

15
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:41,687
What has God writ for me?

16
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:47,089
May none else have
a destiny like mine

17
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:57,235
My boatman is angry with me...

18
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,295
who will row the boat now?

19
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:06,974
In a palanquin...

20
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:26,862
Lakhaniya, take Nandu inside.

21
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:33,063
Good Lord! At such a young age,
his mother has died.

22
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,606
God has been very
unfair to you, Mahesh.

23
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,938
Who's that?

24
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:44,614
Coming from your in-laws' house?
- Yes.

25
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:54,222
A tattered state and a sunken face.
Something surely is fishy.

26
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:58,195
But uncle, who is she?
- You know Damodar Dayal...

27
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:01,564
who was fond of hymns?
She's his daughter.

28
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,128
Mother!

29
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,568
Pushpa, how come
you are here, dear?

30
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,580
What happened?
Did you have a quarrel?

31
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:21,017
I'll never go back there.
I'll stay here now. With you.

32
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:24,179
Are you mad?
Tell me, what happened?

33
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:28,918
Because I couldn't conceive,
he got married a second time.

34
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:32,263
What...?
- Yes, mother. I endured it all.

35
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:36,933
I was putting up with their
atrocities and staying there.

36
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,104
You shouldn't have left
your house like this, dear.

37
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,607
Your home is where your husband is.

38
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:48,038
I wanted to die there.
But I was compelled to come here.

39
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:51,611
I don't believe you.
It must be your fault too.

40
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:58,055
My only fault was that I stayed there
and endured their kicks and abuses.

41
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:00,557
And today...

42
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,556
Look.
- God!

43
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,063
Both of them hit me
with a burning stick.

44
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,233
And pushed me out of the house.

45
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,898
My child!

46
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:17,575
If you too refuse to keep me here,
where will I go?

47
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,578
I am myself living at
other people's mercy, dear.

48
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:27,142
How will I feed you?
- Don't worry, mother. I'll beg.

49
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:32,581
I'll find a job. But don't ask me
to return there, mother.

50
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:37,254
Please don't.
- Don't cry dear, don't.

51
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,598
Come on in. Come on.

52
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:45,599
Son, this time your wedding
should be held in pomp.

53
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:50,598
What are you saying, uncle Nepal?
Had Nandu not been so small...

54
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:55,275
I wouldn't remarry.
- Of course I know, but...

55
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,556
How come Pushpa
came out of your house?

56
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:09,886
Wrong! Why did she come here?
- To ask for a job.

57
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:15,030
Ajob? I know her in-laws very well.
They are well-off.

58
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,562
Something is fishy.
- Could be, I didn't ask.

59
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:24,570
Anyway, when is your marriage?
- On the 24th of this month.

60
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,835
Good! A quick engagement
and a quicker marriage.

61
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:29,146
Son, don't worry about
anything.

62
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:32,981
I'll arrange for everything.
Okay, I'll leave.

63
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,372
Come on!
You are feeling shy of me?

64
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,972
As a child, you used to
sit on my lap.

65
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:05,750
Wrong again. You used to
play in my arms, remember?

66
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:10,980
You've forgotten me? Why did you
go to Mahesh to ask for a job?

67
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:14,351
When Mahesh told me
I felt very bad.

68
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,988
With me around, you and
your mother are in trouble?

69
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,661
Bad! I'll give you a job.

70
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,329
You!
- Yes.

71
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:27,432
I have a vast business in Calcutta.
A land, a house!

72
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,268
But no one to look after it.
Whenever I go there...

73
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:34,007
I sweep the floor, cook the
food.

74
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:38,678
If you handle this, it'll
be beneficial to both of us.

75
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:44,015
But uncle, I...
- I'm saying it for your own good.

76
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,626
Or else, is there dearth of
servants in a city like Calcutta?

77
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:53,564
No! How can I leave
an old mother and go away?

78
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,033
Yes, that's your problem.
But I'm in no hurry.

79
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:02,299
Think and tell me.
But yourjob is fixed at my place.

80
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,305
Okay, I'll think it over
and tell you.

81
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,994
You! What is it?

82
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,398
Sister Mandira, will
you lend me some food grains?

83
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,996
Lend? Why don't you say
you've come to beg?

84
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:39,501
Take it that way. It's not for me.
I can stay hungry, but mother...

85
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:44,515
Go away! Leaving your husband,
aren't you ashamed to go begging?

86
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,551
It is a sin to even
look at you. Get lost!

87
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:10,198
You had been to my place, hadn't you?
Sister-in-law humiliated you?

88
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:14,406
No. When one has no respect,
how can he be humiliated?

89
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:19,049
Don't say that, Pushpa.
Here, keep this money.

90
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,049
But...
- Keep it.

91
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,054
Keep it.

92
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:29,622
Your timely help...
- Forget that, Pushpa.

93
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,657
We have to help each other.

94
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:37,625
I helped you and you...
- Meaning?

95
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,738
It is deserted across
the lake at dusk.

96
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:45,068
Aren't you ashamed?
You are like my elder brother.

97
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,408
By helping me, you want
to play with my honor? Shame on you!

98
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,746
You saw it with your own eyes?
- Yes! Uncle held her hand...

99
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,749
and gave her 100 rupees.
- Really?

100
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,685
Come with me.

101
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,643
Will you tell me
what happened?

102
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,638
Your girl trapped my brother-in-law
and took away money.

103
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:27,309
He saw it with
his own eyes, ask him.

104
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,521
Tell me, did you see or no?
- Yes, I did.

105
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:33,457
Couldn't you sate
your hunger by begging...

106
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:38,060
that you called your daughter
to trap others. Lowly woman!

107
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:41,523
Shut up! Be quiet, sister-in-law.
We are not cheap.

108
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:45,069
Your brother-in-law is!
- Shut up!

109
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:48,632
You wanton, shameless,
characterless whore!

110
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:53,072
Tell me, how much money did you take
from her brother-in-law? And why?

111
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,079
Mother!
- Don't dare call me mother.

112
00:11:56,515 --> 00:12:00,349
Why didn't I die before
hearing all this because of you?

113
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,348
Mother! Mother, listen to me.

114
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,586
Get out of my sight.

115
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,356
You are a whore! Which is why
your husband threw you out.

116
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,023
Go away! Go and drown yourself!

117
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,365
My brother-in-law is cheap?
My foot!

118
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:33,045
Pushpa! Pushpa!
What is this? Oh God!

119
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:37,482
You are going to
commit suicide? Too bad.

120
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,057
Get up! Was I dead?

121
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,053
With me around if you are still in
trouble, it's a shame on me!

122
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,396
Come, let's go to Calcutta.

123
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,735
I told you girls to watch
a lot of films these days.

124
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:03,007
Nowadays people prefer film songs
to classical music.

125
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,612
But all of you have become lazy-bums.
- Auntie, greetings.

126
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:12,019
Mr Nepal, after a long time?
Please come in.

127
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:15,019
Auntie, I had been to my village.
Pushpa, come in.

128
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:21,025
Who is she?
- Pushpa.

129
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,368
She is from my village.
She's very unfortunate, the poor girl.

130
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,037
That's very sad! Come, my
dear.

131
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,032
Go...

132
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:34,374
Don't be afraid. Aunt has opened
this ashram for destitutes like you.

133
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,647
Yes, dear. This is
my musical institute.

134
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:40,374
Girls learn dance and
music here. Can you sing?

135
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,586
Aunt, she's a nightingale.
Her father was a great singer.

136
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,057
Is it?
- He taught her to sing.

137
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,723
Let the teacher come,
only he can judge her voice.

138
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:54,560
Aunt, when do I come?
- After a week.

139
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:59,067
Okay Pushpa, I must leave.
- Will... I stay here?

140
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:06,001
Yes! What else? If you consider aunt
as your mother and keep her happy...

141
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:09,005
all your sorrows
will be over, right?

142
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:12,008
Yes.
- Don't worry, I'll keep coming.

143
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:16,581
Aunt, take her.
- Come dear. This is your house now.

144
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:56,392
Sir...

145
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,661
Should I take you
to the jewel of this lane?

146
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,599
To Munnibai, come on.

147
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,332
Get lost! Don't you see,
he's educated?

148
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,568
Trap someone else for Munnibai.

149
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:11,440
Sir, come here.
You must've heard about Sushma.

150
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,669
Come on.
- Don't touch me.

151
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:17,343
What a dirty place
you have got me, eh?

152
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:21,013
When a passenger
tells me at this hour...

153
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,614
to take him anywhere,
I bring him here.

154
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,023
Disgusting! Let's go back.

155
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:34,350
The night has passed...

156
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,525
and Krishna has not arrived

157
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:45,031
Sleep does not come to me...

158
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:51,041
I get no sleep

159
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:55,479
The night has passed...

160
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:01,415
but Krishna has not arrived

161
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,355
Hey! Mr Anand!

162
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,658
Welcome, Mr Anand! You?
Didn't recognize me?

163
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:25,335
Please sing.
Why have you stopped?

164
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:29,505
Sing, dear.

165
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,017
Sing.

166
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:46,364
Krishna has forgotten the promise
he made

167
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:03,972
Like the lamp...

168
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:09,316
Radha keeps awake

169
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:19,428
I get no sleep...

170
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:24,669
the night is passing by...

171
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:29,998
and Shyam (Krishna)
has not arrived

172
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:01,402
Torn by separation...

173
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,975
she's madly in love

174
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:11,476
In heart and soul,
she thirsts...

175
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:16,578
her eyes brim with tears

176
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:26,428
She can't go to sleep...

177
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:31,593
the night passes by...

178
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:36,998
and Shyam does not arrive

179
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:47,017
Wow! You've turned this room
into a temple.

180
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:56,016
Whoever you are, the pain in your
voice can soothe any aggrieved heart.

181
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,463
Hear that, aunt? What could be
a better compliment than this?

182
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:07,470
Know who he is? Mr Anand, the richest
man in town, my old acquaintance.

183
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:13,369
She's very lucky. The first time
she has sung, and Mr Anand is here.

184
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:19,651
No. The magic in her voice
pulled me here.

185
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:27,387
Then come here every day, Mr Anand.
Pushpa's house is your house too.

186
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,794
Your name is Pushpa?

187
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,433
It should have been Meera.

188
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,080
Have a betel-leaf
from my hands sister-in-law.

189
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:54,251
A look at your rosy lips and Mahesh
will even forget his first wife.

190
00:20:57,189 --> 00:21:00,352
Nandu, go to your new mother.
- Come.

191
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,134
Nandu, come soon.

192
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:25,215
Lalu, look, a birds' nest.
- I'll place it on the tree.

193
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:28,814
Why?

194
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:33,487
On the full moon night, the
mother bird will lay three eggs in it.

195
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:38,019
And we will play with her little ones!
- On the full moon night?

196
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,564
Yes.
- I won't be here.

197
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,093
Where are you going?
- To Calcutta. My new mother said...

198
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:46,093
we will stay there now.
- Then won't you come back?

199
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:50,938
No. Father has gone to look for
a house; we'll soon shift.

200
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,841
The house is nice.
But if the rent could be...

201
00:21:55,213 --> 00:22:00,014
Sorry. Had this house been in
another locality, it would be double.

202
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:04,113
Besides, you'll use the furniture too.
- As you wish.

203
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,450
When are you coming?
- On the first.

204
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:09,125
Two months' advance?
- Sure.

205
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:16,132
I had got the receipt.

206
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,248
Hey! Brother Mahesh!

207
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,121
You...?
- Didn't recognize me? I'm Pushpa.

208
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,457
Who Pushpa?
- Great!

209
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:44,794
You forgot me? Your
foster-sister.

210
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:48,565
Remember? I had come to ask for
a job at your place?

211
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:54,467
Oh yes! But what are you doing here?
- I... come on in.

212
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,305
You'll get completely drenched.
- No, I'm in a hurry.

213
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,076
Let the rain stop. Come in.

214
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,282
Please.

215
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:11,420
Is everyone fine at home?
- Yes.

216
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,623
And your son Nandu?
He must have grown up.

217
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,753
Yes.
- Sit down, I'll come.

218
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:43,610
Oh, you are still standing?
Sit down. Have some sweets.

219
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:48,589
No. I won't eat anything.
- How can this be?

220
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:52,559
We've met after a long time.
Without eating...

221
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:55,125
No, no Pushpa
I'm in a hurry.

222
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:58,125
The rain has also stopped.
I'll take the evening train.

223
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,468
Going to the village?
- Yes.

224
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:02,598
One minute.

225
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,419
Give this fifty rupees
to my mother.

226
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:20,080
Your mother...?
- Yes.

227
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:23,093
I'm very worried about her.

228
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:27,354
So I keep sending her
some money or the other.

229
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:29,057
Through whom?

230
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,668
That... that Mr Nepal...

231
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:34,670
because of whose favors
I'm here today.

232
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:38,175
I keep sending something
or the other through him.

233
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:41,507
I can't face anyone in the
village.

234
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:45,845
Here. Give it to my mother.

235
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,521
Here, keep this money.

236
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,856
Perhaps I've come at the wrong time.
- No.

237
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:00,462
He is a distant cousin of mine
from the village, brother Mahesh.

238
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:06,469
Sorry, seeing the money in
your hand, I had misunderstood.

239
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,468
This is Pushpa's money.
- I'm sending it to my village.

240
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:15,601
Oh yes. You often
send money to your mother.

241
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:20,483
Keep it, you need
not send it anymore.

242
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:23,179
Why?
- Because your mother...

243
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,480
died long ago.

244
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,821
What? She's dead?

245
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,059
No one told me.

246
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:36,160
You are dead for
the villagers, Pushpa.

247
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,999
So it's futile giving you news
about a death.

248
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,511
I'll leave now. Good bye.

249
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:18,465
Don't cry, Pushpa. Whatever you are
today and wherever you are...

250
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:24,812
your tears of sorrow don't mean more
than just saline water.

251
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,484
So wipe your tears, Pushpa.

252
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,160
Yes... You are right, Mr
Anand.

253
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:39,159
You're right.

254
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,757
Sit down.

255
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:54,576
Here.

256
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:59,847
Let this be. Let's go out
today.

257
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:04,116
Where?
- We'll look for a place...

258
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:07,917
where we won't remember anything
at least for sometime.

259
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:10,894
Neither you nor me.

260
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,928
Come on.

261
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:53,934
A fire...

262
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:57,103
a raging fire...

263
00:27:57,542 --> 00:28:01,979
the showers put out

264
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,042
A fire started by the rains...

265
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:10,950
who will extinguish?

266
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:15,887
Who will extinguish it?

267
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:23,333
A garden ravaged by autumn...

268
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:28,062
is restored by Spring

269
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:33,977
A garden ravaged by Spring...

270
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:37,643
who will restore?

271
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,981
Who will?

272
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,224
Do not ask...

273
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:27,892
how the temple
of my dreams crumbled

274
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,630
It hasn't to do with
strangers...

275
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:38,642
it's what my own dear ones
did to me

276
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:44,177
A wound inflicted by a foe...

277
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:49,013
a friend heals

278
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:54,191
When a friend inflicts a
wound...

279
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,326
who will help heal...?

280
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:30,691
There's no saying
what could have happened...

281
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:36,028
or what I might have done

282
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:41,701
I live, because I drink

283
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:46,173
If I didn't drink,
I'd die

284
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:52,248
When the world makes me
thirst...

285
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:56,714
wine quenches it

286
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:02,323
The thirst wine awakens...

287
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:06,054
who will quench?

288
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:44,968
I admit, there's little
one can do against a storm

289
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:52,239
But it isn't the waves
that are to blame...

290
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:56,710
it's something else

291
00:31:57,882 --> 00:32:02,649
A boat caught midseas...

292
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:07,113
is steered to safety
by the boatman

293
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:12,920
But when the pilot
sinks the boat...

294
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:16,662
who can save it?

295
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:25,331
A raging fire...

296
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,347
Kamla, I'm going to the
market.

297
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,348
Keep my clothes ready. I'll go
to work as soon as I return.

298
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:42,348
Okay.
- Father, I'll also come.

299
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,787
No, son.
You've got to go to school.

300
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:48,758
Take him along. If I need
anything, he can bring it for me.

301
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:51,696
Okay, come on.

302
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:01,740
Pushpa, were you fighting
with your client last night?

303
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:06,747
Not at all. He was too drunk,
I had to forcibly send him home.

304
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,043
Aunt! Come in.

305
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:13,317
You're a strange girl.
Do you want him to worship you?

306
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:18,885
He does that, aunt.
- Whatever! I'll tell you the truth...

307
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,920
whether you like it or not.

308
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,866
If you keep spurning him,
you'll regret it all your life.

309
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:26,335
Don't give me sermons
early in the morning.

310
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:29,333
Here... Your commission.

311
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:33,774
You are a very sweet girl.
You never trouble me for money.

312
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:38,838
So girls, there was commotion
in your rooms last night?

313
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,941
We've kept your money, aunt.
Come and collect it.

314
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,948
Let's go.

315
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:49,688
See? How they walked away arrogantly.
As if I'm begging from them.

316
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:52,528
They spend thousands of rupees
on their cosmetics.

317
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,933
But when I ask for money, they
make faces. I'll go now and ask them!

318
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:04,971
Father, our house.
- Yes. Don't run! Careful!

319
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:11,878
You called me?
- Yes. You stay here?

320
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:14,551
Have you rented that house
there?

321
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,856
Come on, father.
- Hey! This is Nandu, isn't he?

322
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:22,658
How big he has grown!
I saw him when he was so small.

323
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:26,829
Take this home, Nandu.
- Okay.

324
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,526
He has grown so much.

325
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:32,665
Look, Pushpa. Don't
talk to me again.

326
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:35,838
Why, brother Mahesh?

327
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:39,736
Because the filthy atmosphere you
live in, is condemned by society.

328
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:44,677
And I live in society.
Meeting you or talking to you...

329
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:47,016
could give me a bad name.

330
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:50,678
So I don't want anyone to know
that I know you.

331
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,629
Hey you! Why are you peeping?

332
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:12,297
Naughty boy! It is you?

333
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:15,771
Hey, Nandu! Listen.

334
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,579
I say, open the door!

335
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:28,317
Shankar, what is the matter?
- She's not opening the door.

336
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:31,787
What's this commotion?

337
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,552
All hell has broken loose.
- What happened?

338
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,818
Shankar is standing outside
Durga's room with a dagger.

339
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:38,991
She's not opening the door.
- Where's aunt?

340
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:42,888
Aunt has gone out with the teacher.
Shankar is drunk, he'll kill Durga.

341
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:45,334
A drunken man is a coward,
let me see.

342
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:49,332
No! I won't let you go there.
Shankar is a dangerous man.

343
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,775
Sometimes one has to
take risks, Pushpa.

344
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,509
There is no thrill in life.
Let's see.

345
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:03,614
Dagger in hand and eyes
turned red with liquor.

346
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,717
And this modern pose
of classical dance.

347
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,951
You had to come back again
on earth, my Lord?

348
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,628
What?
- Give me the dagger please.

349
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:14,454
Give it to me.

350
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:17,801
Shame! What a small knife!

351
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:20,903
Where have you forgotten
your trident Lord Shiva?

352
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:24,804
What rubbish is that, sir.
- Didn't you understand?

353
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:28,309
Your name is Shankar
and you are Lord Shiva.

354
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:32,644
Actually you've mistaken
your concubine to be your wife...

355
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:35,315
who'll throw
open the doors for you.

356
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,322
Now tell me, how can country
liquor taste like sherbet?

357
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:42,318
What are you talking about?

358
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:52,334
Open the door, Durga.
Mr Anand is here. Don't be afraid.

359
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:54,330
Not at all!

360
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:56,500
Is anyone in?

361
00:37:56,874 --> 00:38:00,275
Then why aren't you opening the door?
- My child is burning with fever...

362
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:02,269
he won't let me go.

363
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,685
Sir, please ask him to leave
today.

364
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:11,946
I understand!

365
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:16,954
Bitch, you've shut the door again?
- You're still high, Mr Shankar?

366
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,955
Is the child burning
with fever, yours?

367
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,301
Mine? No way!
I am not his father.

368
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:27,966
Whoever his father is,
but Durga is all yours.

369
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,963
Undoubtedly.
- Then her child is yours too.

370
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,309
Yes.
- If you love her...

371
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:36,637
go and fetch a doctor,
the child is not well.

372
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:39,315
Doctor? Durga is ill?

373
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:42,311
I'll get the doctor now.
- Lord Shiva!

374
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:45,747
Yes!
- Carry your trident, please.

375
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:48,751
Oh yes, I forgot.
Durga is ill.

376
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,325
The show is over.

377
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:55,764
Have you some booze...?

378
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:57,332
Great!

379
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,232
I was scared. What if
something had happened to you?

380
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,232
What has to happen, will
happen.

381
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:08,236
But man should get an
opportunity to become a hero.

382
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:11,375
Didn't you see how
I became a hero?

383
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:15,417
Make a drink quickly,
my kick is wasted.

384
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,925
Oh! Mr Anand!

385
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:27,263
Greetings! Sorry to disturb
you.

386
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,924
Don't feel bad.

387
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:36,938
How can you say such a thing?
How can you ever disturb us?

388
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:39,602
You are the owner of this
garden.

389
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:45,543
After all, you committed the sacred
act of bringing a decent girl here.

390
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,376
Had it not been for you
then who would bring...

391
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:51,949
this flower into this
wilderness?

392
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:57,959
You are embarrassing me.
- Am I?

393
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,296
I won't wait for long.

394
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,961
Pushpa, I'm going
to the village tomorrow.

395
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:06,959
Last time your mother
asked for another 50 rupees.

396
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,968
Mother?

397
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,232
Nepal babu...
- Yes?

398
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:17,976
While grazing, the cattle
do look up in the sky...

399
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:21,148
perhaps to thank the Lord.

400
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:25,653
But you must never
have looked up, have you?

401
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:30,124
Up! The Lord above.

402
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:33,194
Don't you have any fear
of Him at all?

403
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,665
I don't understand.
- You don't?

404
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,335
Come on out, I'll explain.

405
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:46,672
Pushpa has got to know.
- What?

406
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:50,012
Including the folks in the locality.
- What?

407
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,348
That her mother is dead.

408
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:57,220
So drop the curtain now,
the show is over.

409
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,784
Where are you off to?
Take this.

410
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:05,953
No.
- Take it.

411
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:08,055
Take it mister.

412
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:12,631
When you didn't feel ashamed
earlier, why must you today?

413
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,997
Till you live, continue
to rob people like this.

414
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,902
Go, Nepal babu. Go on!

415
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:36,654
Hey Nandu!

416
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:39,328
Coming from school?
- Yes.

417
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:49,170
Mother...
- What is it?

418
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,340
Give me some food.
- After some time.

419
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:55,278
I'm very hungry.
- I told you after some time!

420
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:58,247
Won't you have a bath, brother?
- Yes, go and bathe!

421
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:02,616
Should I go to the pond?
- Go anywhere. Don't chew my brains.

422
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:06,622
Mother, I'm hungry.

423
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:11,624
I'll give my darling boy now.
Come to me.

424
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:26,975
Mother, I'm back.
Now give me some food.

425
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:30,305
Don't you see I'm boiling
the clothes, can't you wait?

426
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:33,641
Give me anything, mother.
I'm very hungry!

427
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:37,312
Want a beating?
Wait for sometime or I will...

428
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:43,659
Is my darling boy still hungry?

429
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:45,990
Here, eat some more.

430
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:25,634
What was that?
What did you break?

431
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,639
What happened? What broke?

432
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:35,303
How did it break? Answer me!

433
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,641
Speak up! Now you've started
stealing and eating, eh?

434
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:44,253
What are you looking at me?
Get down!

435
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:49,818
Rascal! Scoundrel! Loafer!
You steal in the house?

436
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:53,160
Don't dare step in this room again.
I'll break your bones.

437
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:55,322
Get out! Out!

438
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:32,293
Nandu Babu, why are
you sitting here?

439
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:35,300
It is so late, won't you go
home?

440
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:38,970
No! The new mother will beat me.
- Why?

441
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:43,645
I broke the pickle jar.
I was very hungry.

442
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,376
Oh! You haven't eaten as yet?

443
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:50,082
Don't cry, son. Eat.

444
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,988
Eat some sweets. Open your
mouth.

445
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:58,091
Whenever you are hungry
come to me, will you?

446
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:01,294
But don't tell anyone.

447
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,602
Now don't cry.
Good boys never cry.

448
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,439
Wow! You have worn a nice
shirt.

449
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:12,841
Father bought it?
- Yes.

450
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,445
Whom are these samosas for?
- No! Don't!

451
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:19,047
Give me some!
- They're stale, my son.

452
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,881
I love samosas.
- Really?

453
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,784
Tomorrow I'll order
hot samosas for you.

454
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,125
Eat sweets today.

455
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:32,460
Here.

456
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:35,464
Take more.

457
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:38,626
And leave now.
- Why?

458
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:43,462
It's going to be evening.
Go home and study.

459
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:47,475
I do that in the morning
and play in the evening.

460
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:51,913
But you must leave, son.
You shouldn't stay any longer.

461
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:55,911
My guests will be here soon.
- Why? What will they do?

462
00:45:57,354 --> 00:46:01,085
Nothing. But you must leave,
because I'm asking you to.

463
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:05,761
Who are they? Whom are you expecting?
Your brothers?

464
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,091
You won't understand.

465
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:17,202
Go on now and come soon tomorrow.
I'll get lots of samosas for you.

466
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:23,507
The whole day was really wasted.
We couldn't do anything.

467
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:28,284
No, we did. We learnt that the
man who just left...

468
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,619
was absolutely third-rate.

469
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:35,718
A rascal! Forget that!
Tell your wife to prepare tea.

470
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:41,963
Master, madam is not home.

471
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:46,134
Never mind. Prepare two cups of tea.
- Very well.

472
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:50,130
You sit. I'll change
the cover and come.

473
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:56,978
Listen... leave the cigarettes
here.

474
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:08,480
What's all this!
This servant is good-for-nothing.

475
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:16,398
Yes, sir?
- What's all this? Pick it up!

476
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,933
Listen! When I call you,
why don't you answer?

477
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:24,431
How will I, sir? You call
Balram, my name is Hariram.

478
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:29,411
Oh, yes! I forgot. But Mr Hariram,
Balram was your elder brother.

479
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:35,518
Whatever, he was a very nice man.
Very brave! People feared him.

480
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:40,285
You know, at dusk even he had
the habit of drinking liquor like me.

481
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:42,624
Understood, Mr Balram?
- Hariram, Master.

482
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:47,620
I'm sorry. Mr Hariram, I want
to change my clothes...

483
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:51,299
can I have a pajama?
- Right away, sir.

484
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,630
Where are... my slippers?

485
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:59,969
Hariram! Where are my slippers?

486
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:03,142
The pajama is wet, sir.
- What?

487
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,477
It is still wet.

488
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:08,483
Do I have only one pair
of pajama, Mr Hariram?

489
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:12,921
The rest of them are in the cupboard.
The keys are with madam.

490
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:16,583
So get me a dhoti.

491
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:29,571
Sir, I can't find the dhoti.
I searched high and low.

492
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:34,103
What are you saying, Hariram?
When Draupadi was being disrobed...

493
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:37,044
you provided an unlimited
number of saris.

494
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:40,109
And not a single dhoti for me?
Very bad!

495
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:44,582
Must be in the laundry.
- First prepare tea for me...

496
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:47,252
then go to the
laundry and fetch my dhoti.

497
00:48:57,701 --> 00:48:59,931
You haven't changed
your cover as yet?

498
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:02,938
Do you know when we
change covers, friend?

499
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:06,105
When people love the book.

500
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:09,874
When its new edition
is released. But in this house...

501
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:13,814
I have become an old book.

502
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:16,650
Neither anyone wants
to look at it nor read it.

503
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:18,887
Sir, it's difficult to brew tea.
- Why?

504
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:21,120
The milk has curdled.
- Repair it.

505
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:23,216
How can I do that?

506
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:26,228
Do you know where
the mistress has gone?

507
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:28,893
Yes, to the saloon to set her
hair.

508
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:31,896
Saloon...? To set her hair?

509
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:44,075
Get two cups of tea from
the restaurant opposite.

510
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:46,239
No, let it be.

511
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:48,583
Come with me to my house,
it's nearby.

512
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:51,180
You know what you'll
get with tea? Puris,...

513
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:54,150
potato vegetable and hot halwa.

514
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:57,189
And my wife makes her hair
at home.

515
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:00,924
At home?

516
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:07,192
Look at me.
I have a house and I don't.

517
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,905
I have a wife and still I
don't.

518
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:13,942
Anand, shall I tell you
something? Don't feel offended.

519
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:17,305
You are responsible for all this.
However a wife is...

520
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:20,614
she wouldn't want her
husband to spend the night out.

521
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,953
A man can work
all day like a machine.

522
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:29,624
But when he returns home,
he wants something.

523
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:33,790
When he doesn't find it at home,
he looks for it outside.

524
00:50:39,736 --> 00:50:42,170
Madam? Yes, sir is home.

525
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:44,397
It's madam.

526
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:48,109
Let it be? Okay?

527
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:57,919
It was madam. She said she will
go to the party from the saloon.

528
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:00,846
She'll be late.
- See that, brother?

529
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:04,418
I'm not the only one
who comes late at night.

530
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:08,394
Forget it. You won't understand.
As I said...

531
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,195
Go home now.
- Aren't you coming?

532
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,393
Me?

533
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,473
Some other day.

534
00:51:27,317 --> 00:51:29,877
Sir, shall I get some tea?
- Will you really?

535
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:34,413
Forget it. Fetch my clothes.
- Sir, money?

536
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:38,220
My purse is on the table, take it.
- Okay.

537
00:51:59,683 --> 00:52:01,514
Anita? Who's calling?

538
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:06,851
She's not at home.
She has gone to a party.

539
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:09,657
I don't know. She will be late.

540
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:16,865
I'm her husband.
Why? You felt bad?

541
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:19,295
Good day.

542
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:06,942
Welcome.

543
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:09,617
After searching high and low
I realized that...

544
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:11,945
in life there is sweetness
only in two places.

545
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:14,954
One at the sweet shop
and the other in your voice.

546
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:19,821
I've brought hot 'jalebies' for you.
- Sit down, I'll serve it in a plate.

547
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:23,798
No.
I don't like eating sweets.

548
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:26,301
I only love to watch it.

549
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,964
When you don't eat,
why do you bring it everyday?

550
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:32,867
I've got into the habit.
And I enjoy it.

551
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:36,303
You love savories, don't you?
- Yes.

552
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:39,708
Salty, hot and spicy...

553
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:42,643
which go in and
reduce everything to ashes.

554
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:46,787
Go... get the bottle.

555
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:48,589
Okay.

556
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:55,822
Listen.

557
00:53:56,499 --> 00:53:58,763
Get some 'samosas'
and 'kachories' tomorrow.

558
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:02,270
Will you eat them?

559
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:09,603
I won't let you drink on an empty
stomach. I'll prepare something soon.

560
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:15,610
Listen.

561
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:20,285
Do you know to fry puris?
- Puris?

562
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:23,621
A potato dish and halwa...?

563
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:27,761
Can you prepare it?
- Will you eat all that?

564
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:33,631
Sure, I will. If you sit with me
and feed me with love.

565
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:36,632
I'll get it.

566
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:47,645
Mother has sent these for a wash.
- Keep it here.

567
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:51,920
Iron father's clothes and
send them tomorrow morning.

568
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:54,081
Greetings, sir.

569
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:11,099
Mr Natwarlal, a newspaper
is meant to be read...

570
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:12,435
and you use it to
hide your face?

571
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:15,777
Mr Anand! There's danger.
- Danger?

572
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:18,772
Yes, there's this Pathan after me.
- A Pathan?

573
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:21,777
Yes. I had borrowed money from
him.

574
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:25,781
And I thought you
are hiding from me.

575
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:30,955
From you? We are two sides
of the same coin, Mr Anand.

576
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:33,452
And besides, where coming
here is concerned...

577
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:36,457
I'm more shameless than you
are.

578
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:40,369
I must leave now.
- What is the hurry?

579
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:44,806
Mr Anand, Pyari and Dulari...
- Are they waiting for you?

580
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,401
Go on.

581
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:04,957
You're late, son.

582
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:07,992
My step-mother had sent me
to the washerman.

583
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,428
Will you have some hot samosas?
- Yes.

584
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,097
In a moment.

585
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:21,439
Eat this.
- Who's this young man?

586
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:24,108
This is Nandu. You had
met brother Mahesh,...

587
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:26,979
his elder son.
He stays right opposite.

588
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,985
Nandu loves samosas?
- Yes.

589
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:33,454
Have some more.

590
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,881
Okay, son. Come tomorrow.

591
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,459
Will you give me samosas
tomorrow as well?

592
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,855
Sure! Go now.

593
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:49,904
You love him a lot?

594
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:57,478
Anand babu,
how many children do you have?

595
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:00,581
None.

596
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:06,852
And wife?
- Well, she's indeed there.

597
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:09,424
An ideal housewife.

598
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:15,794
So why must you leave such an
ideal housewife and come here?

599
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,929
You are a decent man.

600
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:24,769
The more decent a man is
the more evil he can become.

601
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:31,038
I come here only to see to what extent
I can go in becoming evil.

602
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:34,445
Do... you... really...

603
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:36,608
come here for this?

604
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:39,878
Tell me something, Pushpa.

605
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:42,156
You are an ill-reputed woman.

606
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:46,786
Then why does a decent boy
like Nandu come here?

607
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:52,132
His is a different case.
His step-mother doesn't love him.

608
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:56,471
No one loves me either.

609
00:57:57,173 --> 00:58:00,404
Don't say that.
- Which is why I come here.

610
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:03,870
Don't ever ask me why again.

611
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:07,949
Make a drink.

612
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,487
Where did you get the samosas from?
- From there!

613
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,557
There? Where's that!

614
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:19,386
The one who stays opposite...
she gave it to me.

615
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:22,729
Dirty scoundrel! Rascal!
Why did you go there?

616
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,233
Throw it away!

617
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:29,066
God help us! You eat
at her place? Dirty pig!

618
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:33,531
Why? What is it with her place?
- You don't have to know that.

619
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,611
If you go there again,
I'll break your legs!

620
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,410
Munni, stay with him.
Come on in, Raju!

621
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,618
Ashok Kumar's performance
in 'Sangram' was excellent.

622
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:48,624
I'm crazy about Dev Anand. I saw his
film and I kept dreaming about him.

623
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:53,754
Ashok Kumar and Dev Anand
get to become heroes.

624
00:58:54,430 --> 00:59:00,369
I bought balcony tickets for you
and I became a zero?

625
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:03,532
You're unnecessarily getting angry.
- Of course.

626
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,540
You are our real
hero, Mr Natwarlal.

627
00:59:07,143 --> 00:59:11,045
Mr Natwarlal, what if we had meet
your wife at the movies?

628
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:15,582
Mr Natwarlal, do you borrow money
from the moneylender?

629
00:59:16,152 --> 00:59:18,052
I have to, bloody hell.

630
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:21,548
To come to your house, I've got to
go to the moneylender first.

631
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:25,059
You do have a sense of humor.
- Pyari, will you have 'Pani Puri'?

632
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:28,726
Please treat us.
- Don't be so cruel.

633
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,496
You just saw a film.
- So what?

634
00:59:31,834 --> 00:59:33,631
You like the two of us.

635
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:36,530
I'll like you more
if you make me spend lesser.

636
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:39,073
We'll have just a little.
- Come on.

637
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:42,076
Hey vendor!
Make some 'Pani Puri'.

638
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:45,640
What difference will it make?
I'm doomed anyway.

639
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:00,586
You are giving only them?
Give me some too.

640
01:00:01,197 --> 01:00:03,097
I'm the one who's paying you.

641
01:00:03,466 --> 01:00:09,530
No... no tangy-water for me.
I'll be done for. I have the water.

642
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:13,437
I'll add my water. Fresh water.

643
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:43,464
Give me more.
- It's all over.

644
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,573
Over? Never mind.

645
01:00:52,248 --> 01:00:56,150
Bloody hell!
My water's also over.

646
01:00:57,253 --> 01:00:59,653
How much is that?
- Fifteen rupees, sir.

647
01:01:00,256 --> 01:01:02,417
Fifteen? Never mind.

648
01:01:04,293 --> 01:01:06,693
Bloody hell!
My pocket has been picked.

649
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:09,357
Whatever it is,
you'll have to pay me, mister.

650
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:11,259
Sure, I will.

651
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:14,429
Is there any money in your
purses?

652
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:19,104
It's empty.
- Empty?

653
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:21,767
What is your name?

654
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:26,681
Keep this.
- I don't drink, sir.

655
01:01:27,316 --> 01:01:31,446
Who's asking you to drink?
I'm pawning it with you.

656
01:01:31,888 --> 01:01:35,119
I'll get the money
tomorrow and release it.

657
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:37,689
Ladies, let's go.

658
01:01:47,804 --> 01:01:50,295
Look I've got 'samosas'
and 'kachories' too.

659
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:54,642
Where is your son?

660
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:58,179
Is that meant to be a joke?

661
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:04,910
You're the one who's playing
a joke, Pushpa. On yourself.

662
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:12,589
Should I get it?
- No, later.

663
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:15,259
Give it to the one I got it
for.

664
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:18,766
Hasn't he come yet?

665
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:21,034
No.

666
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:36,081
Brother, you are going there?
I'll tell mother.

667
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:40,280
Mother, he is going there again!
- Nandu, you are going there again?

668
01:02:40,857 --> 01:02:43,621
I wonder what spell that
prostitute has cast on you!

669
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:46,961
That witch is not ashamed of
spoiling respectable children.

670
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:50,031
Damn it! I am fed up!

671
01:02:50,366 --> 01:02:52,926
That little boy has
made life miserable.

672
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:56,771
What is it all about?
Tell me.

673
01:02:58,374 --> 01:03:01,207
There! There are tears
in your eyes again?

674
01:03:01,911 --> 01:03:04,744
I've told you so
many times, Pushpa.

675
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:06,872
I can't bear to see tears.

676
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:11,547
Listen...

677
01:03:11,988 --> 01:03:15,651
You are heading for
a deep, dark well, Pushpa.

678
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:19,219
But your thirst will not
quench, you'll be drowned.

679
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:24,891
Now what is left to
get drowned, Mr Anand?

680
01:03:25,334 --> 01:03:26,232
There is!

681
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:31,232
If there wasn't, this Anand
would never have come to you.

682
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:33,902
He wouldn't give you
money every month.

683
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:36,901
Nor would he keep
you bedecked like this.

684
01:03:38,347 --> 01:03:42,249
Honestly, Mr Anand.
I never thought...

685
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:45,582
I'd start
loving Nandu so much.

686
01:03:46,622 --> 01:03:51,685
Like every woman I thought
I'd have a house too.

687
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:55,691
A husband, children.

688
01:03:57,066 --> 01:03:59,261
But... nothing happened.

689
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:02,202
Nothing.

690
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,200
Mister, aren't you ashamed to
stay here with your wife?

691
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:11,704
I'm so ashamed that I have to
come and go on the sly.

692
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:14,610
You can do that.
But what do I do?

693
01:04:15,117 --> 01:04:17,017
Because of these women,
I can't even step out of the house.

694
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:26,290
People will talk

695
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:31,695
It's for them to talk

696
01:04:32,735 --> 01:04:40,642
Forget it, let's not spend the night
discussing such trivia

697
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:48,315
People will talk

698
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:53,748
It's for them to talk

699
01:04:54,757 --> 01:05:02,596
Let's not spend the night
talking about such things

700
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:10,599
People will say things

701
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:49,306
It has been a norm
in the world

702
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:54,748
Every dawn ended in dusk

703
01:05:55,418 --> 01:06:00,583
Who are you?
And what is it about you?

704
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:05,789
Even the chaste Sita
got a bad name here

705
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:12,026
So why does what people say...

706
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:17,267
bring tears your eyes?

707
01:06:18,374 --> 01:06:22,538
Tongues will wag

708
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:27,707
It's for people to talk

709
01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:36,758
Let not the night pass while
we discuss such worthless things

710
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:44,626
People will talk

711
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,699
There are those
who taunt me

712
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:28,367
They ask me, what vice
I'm immersed in

713
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:34,073
I've seen them too...

714
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:39,145
coming secretly to
these notorious lanes

715
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:44,919
This is true,
it's not a falsehood...

716
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:50,731
tell me, isn't it true?

717
01:07:51,634 --> 01:07:55,730
People will say things

718
01:07:56,839 --> 01:08:01,003
It's for people to talk

719
01:08:01,877 --> 01:08:09,682
Let's not waste the night
discussing such rubbish

720
01:08:13,456 --> 01:08:17,688
People will talk

721
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:23,128
It's like them to talk

722
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:27,767
No, Laxmi.
I don't want to stay here anymore.

723
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,667
Where will you go?

724
01:08:31,006 --> 01:08:33,167
Wherever you go
people will taunt you.

725
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:36,645
I've asked him to look for a house
in a decent locality.

726
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:39,679
Of course!
Mr Anand is a rich man.

727
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:42,182
He can...
- Excuse me.

728
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:45,515
Is there a woman
named Pushpa here?

729
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:47,850
That's me.

730
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:51,725
I want to talk to you.
- Yes?

731
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:55,620
Here? Which is your room?

732
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,362
Follow me.

733
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:07,334
This is my room. Please sit
down.

734
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:10,544
Does Mr Anand come here?

735
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:14,148
Who are you?
- Does he or does he not? Answer me!

736
01:09:14,683 --> 01:09:16,583
Lower your voice.

737
01:09:17,686 --> 01:09:20,154
When I don't know you...
- Anand is my brother-in-law.

738
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:23,323
And my sister doesn't want him
to come here.

739
01:09:23,959 --> 01:09:26,723
So why does she let him?
- He forcibly comes here.

740
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:31,491
When she can't stop him...
- I don't want to argue.

741
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:34,828
If my brother-in-law comes here,
please ask him to go back.

742
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:41,710
How will that help?
Will you be able to hold him back?

743
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:45,404
Besides, I'm not the only
one in this big city.

744
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:47,748
I care a damn for
how many of you there are.

745
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:51,183
I'm here only to tell you
to stop him! That's all!

746
01:09:52,555 --> 01:09:53,783
I can't.

747
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:56,520
Why don't you say that
you suffer a loss?

748
01:09:57,293 --> 01:09:59,193
You don't have a brother or a
son.

749
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:01,357
How will you understand
my sister's sorrow?

750
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:04,565
Money is your only....
- Hey you!

751
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:08,361
Why are you talking nonsense?
Who are you?

752
01:10:08,804 --> 01:10:09,862
Mr Anand's relative.

753
01:10:10,306 --> 01:10:11,898
With whom do you want
to form a relation here?

754
01:10:12,308 --> 01:10:14,208
Mind your tongue!
- You mind your tongue!

755
01:10:14,743 --> 01:10:16,643
He is shouting at us
in our house only!

756
01:10:16,912 --> 01:10:18,402
Get out! Out!

757
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:21,205
Out!
- What are you doing, aunt?

758
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:26,553
Please go away.
I promise you...

759
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:31,555
Mr Anand will never come here again.
- I'll be highly obliged!

760
01:10:34,663 --> 01:10:37,723
What have you done? At his
behest, you'll desert Anand?

761
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:41,802
I gave worrying about
separations...

762
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:45,906
...the day I came here, aunt.
- Why be so mad?

763
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:50,037
You won't understand, aunt.

764
01:11:16,538 --> 01:11:18,438
Why are you crying?

765
01:11:18,874 --> 01:11:21,604
For you.
Where were you yesterday?

766
01:11:22,177 --> 01:11:25,442
Father and mother stop me
from coming here.

767
01:11:25,881 --> 01:11:27,940
They say only dirty people come
here.

768
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:31,451
No one will come now, son.

769
01:11:32,254 --> 01:11:35,985
I won't let anyone except
you here. No one!

770
01:11:57,646 --> 01:12:00,740
Why is the door closed today?
Open!

771
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:10,758
Your lover is at your doorstep.
Open the door.

772
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:17,961
Please leave, Mr Anand.

773
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:20,934
Leave? What for?

774
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:25,097
Don't ever come here again.

775
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:27,438
What's wrong with you?

776
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:33,614
Open the door.

777
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:41,985
No. Go back.

778
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:45,119
To your wife.
- There!

779
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:50,024
She's the one I leave and come,
and you want me to go back to her?

780
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:52,958
I don't come to go back,
Pushpa.

781
01:12:53,902 --> 01:12:55,597
Then wait outside!

782
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:24,890
Hey! Hello, Mr Anand!

783
01:13:25,334 --> 01:13:27,131
You, on the road?
The door is closed.

784
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:30,137
Is there a festival today?

785
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:34,233
There's a crowd everywhere and
a queue before every room.

786
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:36,836
Which queue are you
standing in Mr Natwarlal?

787
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:40,238
I don't believe in queues.
My principle is...

788
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:44,116
when one door closes,
another one opens.

789
01:13:44,787 --> 01:13:48,587
Which is why I love
two girls at a time.

790
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:52,583
If not Pyari then Dulari. Come on.
- With you?

791
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:55,159
Hey, don't worry.

792
01:13:55,697 --> 01:13:59,599
I have this
country-made stuff with me.

793
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:03,095
Mr Anand, sometimes one should
enjoy country-made liquor too.

794
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:04,867
Come on.

795
01:14:06,642 --> 01:14:08,872
First lift your left leg.

796
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:23,549
Look who is here!

797
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:26,984
Mr Anand. You?
We are so lucky!

798
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:29,226
Whose face did we see
early in the morning?

799
01:14:29,665 --> 01:14:31,565
Mine, of course.
You forgot?

800
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,900
A donkey praises its own tail.

801
01:14:35,003 --> 01:14:36,664
Please come.
- Sit down.

802
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:38,700
Please sit down.

803
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:42,010
I brought you here and you're
the one who's being pampered.

804
01:14:45,113 --> 01:14:49,573
A glass for me
and a glass for Mr Anand.

805
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:03,029
Why are you quiet?
What's wrong?

806
01:15:03,632 --> 01:15:04,530
Nothing.

807
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:07,962
Of course there is.
Don't lie to me.

808
01:15:08,637 --> 01:15:11,197
Tell me. Go on.
- Natwarlal...

809
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:15,872
what do I say to you?
- Tell me what happened?

810
01:15:16,645 --> 01:15:17,669
Must I?

811
01:15:17,946 --> 01:15:20,540
What has happened...

812
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:26,149
how did it happen
and when?

813
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:29,146
What will I tell you

814
01:15:29,658 --> 01:15:32,218
What has happened...

815
01:15:33,662 --> 01:15:39,066
how did it happen
and when?

816
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:43,563
It happened when it
had to happen

817
01:15:44,139 --> 01:15:47,905
Forget it. Let's not talk about
it

818
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:51,908
What has happened...?

819
01:15:53,282 --> 01:15:58,914
how did it happen
and when?

820
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:02,851
It all happened when
it had to happen

821
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:07,520
Forget it. Let's not talk about
it

822
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:48,560
Why must I complain anyway?

823
01:16:49,204 --> 01:16:52,571
I'm heart-broken.
But how does it matter?

824
01:16:53,675 --> 01:16:57,270
It was a fragile toy...

825
01:16:57,946 --> 01:17:01,040
something had to happen to it,
and it happened

826
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:04,048
What has happened...?

827
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:10,954
how did it happen
and when?

828
01:17:11,693 --> 01:17:15,060
It all occurred
when it had to

829
01:17:16,164 --> 01:17:19,691
Forget it... let's not
talk about it

830
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:26,907
Do you understand?

831
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:51,759
That which I saw and heard...

832
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:55,569
how will I describe it to you?

833
01:17:57,139 --> 01:18:00,506
It was a beautiful dream...

834
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:04,507
it had to end
and it did

835
01:18:05,113 --> 01:18:07,673
What has happened...

836
01:18:08,617 --> 01:18:14,112
how did it happen
and when?

837
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:18,518
It happened when it had to

838
01:18:19,628 --> 01:18:22,893
Let's not talk about it

839
01:18:53,462 --> 01:19:01,301
I'll drink to my heart's content
and sway in these streets

840
01:19:04,673 --> 01:19:08,507
I had to lose my heart here...

841
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:12,070
and get a bad name...
I did

842
01:19:12,814 --> 01:19:15,510
What has happened...

843
01:19:16,618 --> 01:19:21,988
how did it happen
and when?

844
01:19:22,624 --> 01:19:26,116
It happened when it had to

845
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:30,696
Let's not talk about it

846
01:19:39,674 --> 01:19:40,936
Welcome, sir.

847
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:46,111
What's the time?
- It's two.

848
01:19:46,882 --> 01:19:47,780
Two?

849
01:19:50,218 --> 01:19:55,121
You haven't slept as yet?
- No, sir. Nor has madam returned yet.

850
01:19:57,893 --> 01:20:03,126
When your master got tired
waiting for your mistress...

851
01:20:03,532 --> 01:20:05,432
...why are you awake,
Mr Balram?

852
01:20:05,934 --> 01:20:08,903
Hariram, master.
- Oh, the younger brother?

853
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:11,395
Go to sleep.

854
01:20:11,907 --> 01:20:13,807
Lock the door and go to sleep.

855
01:20:14,576 --> 01:20:17,443
Pushpa didn't do the right thing
by sending Mr Anand away.

856
01:20:17,946 --> 01:20:21,814
She doesn't know what's good for her.
Why talk about her, auntie?

857
01:20:24,419 --> 01:20:27,411
Here comes the devil!
Naughty fellow!

858
01:20:28,924 --> 01:20:30,824
Hey! What are you doing there?

859
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:34,356
Nothing!
- Nothing!

860
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:37,831
The Prince! Pushpa has
unnecessarily pampered him.

861
01:20:40,535 --> 01:20:43,436
Hey Gopal! Only three days are
left for the festival.

862
01:20:44,105 --> 01:20:45,936
The idols aren't ready as yet.

863
01:20:46,374 --> 01:20:48,842
You haven't brought clay from
the dancing-women's courtyard.

864
01:20:49,544 --> 01:20:51,239
I don't understand something,
uncle.

865
01:20:51,613 --> 01:20:54,844
Why is their impure mud mixed in the
idol of goddess Durga?

866
01:20:55,383 --> 01:20:58,181
Who knows?
It's an old custom.

867
01:20:59,054 --> 01:21:02,785
Without mixing that clay, Durga's
idol is not placed for worship.

868
01:21:03,291 --> 01:21:05,782
Get on with your work.
I'll go and get the mud.

869
01:21:06,895 --> 01:21:09,796
When will you paint the idol?
- In a day or two.

870
01:21:10,232 --> 01:21:12,132
Where did you get this
blooming dale sapling from?

871
01:21:12,567 --> 01:21:14,228
From the opposite garden.

872
01:21:14,569 --> 01:21:16,799
Plant it in your house;
a lot of flowers will blossom.

873
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:19,139
Really?
- Of course.

874
01:21:19,574 --> 01:21:22,805
Go quickly, or else it
will wither away. Go on.

875
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,410
What will you do with this
clay?

876
01:21:33,922 --> 01:21:35,514
It'll be used in an idol
for the Goddess.

877
01:21:35,957 --> 01:21:40,257
Is this clay very nice?
- It is sacred, son.

878
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:44,830
Then can I plant this here?
- Sure, why not?

879
01:21:48,937 --> 01:21:51,371
Okay, ladies.
Thank you very much. Good day.

880
01:21:59,948 --> 01:22:01,779
What are you doing?

881
01:22:02,217 --> 01:22:05,186
I'm planting the dale sapling.
- Oh!

882
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:09,782
When it grows, a lot of
flowers will blossom on it.

883
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:14,360
What will you do with them?
- I'll pluck them for you.

884
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:18,131
Me?
- Yes, because you pray.

885
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:24,301
You know, when it grows...

886
01:22:24,906 --> 01:22:29,275
a bird will come and
build a small nest in it.

887
01:22:29,911 --> 01:22:31,811
I see! What will happen then?

888
01:22:32,247 --> 01:22:34,147
Then? On the full moon night...

889
01:22:34,916 --> 01:22:37,817
the mother bird will
lay three eggs in it.

890
01:22:38,253 --> 01:22:40,346
Great! On the full moon
night...

891
01:22:40,922 --> 01:22:43,288
the mother-bird
will lay three eggs,...

892
01:22:43,658 --> 01:22:45,819
who told you all this?
- Lalu did.

893
01:22:46,394 --> 01:22:49,830
Who Lalu?
- My friend who stays in the village.

894
01:22:50,432 --> 01:22:52,491
Have you ever been
to Madhavpur?

895
01:22:55,203 --> 01:22:57,228
We used to stay there earlier.

896
01:22:58,106 --> 01:23:03,271
Near the lake below the tree,
there was a huge nest.

897
01:23:03,878 --> 01:23:06,039
Lalu picked it up and
placed it on the tree.

898
01:23:06,881 --> 01:23:11,215
And said the bird will lay three
eggs on the full moon night.

899
01:23:14,889 --> 01:23:16,789
Aren't you listening to me?

900
01:23:17,559 --> 01:23:19,789
I am, son.
- Look.

901
01:23:20,895 --> 01:23:24,262
I have planted it here.
Don't let it wither away.

902
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:28,365
No, son.
I'll never let it dry.

903
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,063
Never.

904
01:23:46,721 --> 01:23:47,619
You!

905
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:53,124
Yes, I remember. You had stopped
me from coming here.

906
01:23:54,295 --> 01:23:55,557
So why?

907
01:23:57,332 --> 01:24:00,130
To know...
why I can't come.

908
01:24:03,772 --> 01:24:05,672
Your wife doesn't want you
to come here.

909
01:24:06,841 --> 01:24:11,073
No wife in the world would
want her husband to come here.

910
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:13,748
Then what will you
gain by hurting her?

911
01:24:14,249 --> 01:24:15,273
Happiness.

912
01:24:15,683 --> 01:24:19,084
The little joy that I got,
I got it right here.

913
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:25,185
My marriage is the biggest
curse of my life, Pushpa.

914
01:24:27,195 --> 01:24:33,100
But she's your wife.
- Yes. That is her trump card.

915
01:24:34,202 --> 01:24:36,102
My house is a house of cards.

916
01:24:36,971 --> 01:24:40,771
Every time I try to build it,
it collapses.

917
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:46,442
I wonder how she is who cannot
be happy with a man like you.

918
01:24:46,981 --> 01:24:48,312
Forget her.

919
01:24:50,318 --> 01:24:54,550
You also don't want me to
forget my sorrows for sometime.

920
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:56,515
Mr Anand.

921
01:25:01,963 --> 01:25:03,590
Did you water my plant?

922
01:25:04,165 --> 01:25:06,633
Plant? What plant?
- The blooming dale.

923
01:25:07,502 --> 01:25:11,404
Nandu has planted the blooming
dale in our courtyard.

924
01:25:13,842 --> 01:25:17,175
What I was here to ask you,
I got the answer from Nandu.

925
01:25:17,979 --> 01:25:20,345
Nandu there will be
flowers in your courtyard.

926
01:25:20,882 --> 01:25:24,511
Blooming dale flowers.
I'm so unfortunate...

927
01:25:24,986 --> 01:25:28,080
Don't say that.
- There's no harm in speaking the truth.

928
01:25:28,923 --> 01:25:31,084
If I come here, this plant
will wither away.

929
01:25:31,693 --> 01:25:34,491
The blooming dale will wither away.
- No.

930
01:25:35,530 --> 01:25:39,489
You don't know how
much faith I have in you.

931
01:25:40,201 --> 01:25:41,828
How much I like you!

932
01:25:43,271 --> 01:25:45,432
You do?
- Yes.

933
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:49,109
So I don't want you to come
here.

934
01:25:50,211 --> 01:25:53,442
If you don't want me to,
I won't come.

935
01:25:54,883 --> 01:25:57,113
Perhaps we won't
meet each other again.

936
01:25:57,986 --> 01:25:59,214
But still...

937
01:25:59,554 --> 01:26:02,614
if you ever need anything,
please don't hesitate.

938
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:05,717
I'll leave now.

939
01:26:06,227 --> 01:26:08,491
Mr Nandu, I'm going.

940
01:26:09,931 --> 01:26:12,525
But before going I bless you...

941
01:26:13,301 --> 01:26:17,203
may a lot of flowers
blossom on your tree.

942
01:26:17,705 --> 01:26:23,075
Will they?
- Yes, plenty of flowers.

943
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:27,615
The fragrance of your flower
will spread far and wide.

944
01:26:28,917 --> 01:26:31,408
Your life will be
filled with joy, Nandu.

945
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:34,587
May I go?

946
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:39,622
So long, Pushpa.

947
01:26:49,437 --> 01:26:52,702
Hey, Nandu.
You are in bed early.

948
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:57,007
What is it, son?

949
01:26:57,712 --> 01:26:59,612
I have a severe head-ache,
father.

950
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:02,949
God! You're burning with fever.

951
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:07,613
Listen! Nandu has a high fever!

952
01:27:08,389 --> 01:27:10,653
Why not? He roams around
in the scorching sun.

953
01:27:11,192 --> 01:27:12,955
He doesn't listen to me,
now let him suffer.

954
01:27:13,261 --> 01:27:16,958
Call the doctor
and look after him.

955
01:27:17,465 --> 01:27:19,626
I don't have the time.
I've got a lot of work to do.

956
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:34,478
Where are you going?
- To the temple.

957
01:27:35,516 --> 01:27:39,646
Sister Pushpa, where is
your son nowadays?

958
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:43,982
I don't know. His parents don't
approve of him coming here.

959
01:27:44,859 --> 01:27:46,656
Perhaps they have stopped him.

960
01:28:08,716 --> 01:28:11,082
You didn't come for two days.
What happened to you?

961
01:28:11,519 --> 01:28:14,352
Fever.
- Fever?

962
01:28:16,057 --> 01:28:19,322
Where is your step-mother?
- She's sleeping in the next room.

963
01:28:20,061 --> 01:28:23,963
My sister is awake
if she sees you...

964
01:28:24,565 --> 01:28:29,059
she'll wake mother,
And mother will scold you.

965
01:28:30,271 --> 01:28:33,468
Go away. When I'm all right,
I'll come to you.

966
01:28:34,075 --> 01:28:37,977
No, come when you
are completely cured.

967
01:28:51,092 --> 01:28:52,992
Here, drink this.

968
01:29:01,035 --> 01:29:04,471
Why did you leave it?
- I don't like sago.

969
01:29:05,373 --> 01:29:07,500
Will you eat sweets in fever?

970
01:29:08,042 --> 01:29:10,442
Will you drink or not?
- No. I won't.

971
01:29:11,045 --> 01:29:14,276
God!
Is he an enemy of mine!

972
01:29:14,716 --> 01:29:17,412
Come Raju, let's go.
Let him go to hell!

973
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:47,308
Hey, Nandu!

974
01:29:50,118 --> 01:29:53,315
How are you feeling now?
- My fever is not subsiding.

975
01:29:53,755 --> 01:29:57,316
Why? It has been so long.
Doesn't the doctor come here?

976
01:29:57,792 --> 01:29:58,986
He does.

977
01:30:03,264 --> 01:30:05,323
Why didn't you call
a senior doctor?

978
01:30:05,633 --> 01:30:10,536
Their fee is high and my father
doesn't have the money.

979
01:30:14,108 --> 01:30:17,009
Look, I've got some grapes
and apples for you.

980
01:30:18,112 --> 01:30:20,012
You want it?
- Yes.

981
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:26,651
Eat.

982
01:30:28,222 --> 01:30:31,658
Hey, Nandu! Whom are you
talking to? Who's there?

983
01:30:31,993 --> 01:30:33,893
No one, mother.
You go to sleep.

984
01:30:34,762 --> 01:30:36,662
Go now. Mother will get up.

985
01:30:46,841 --> 01:30:48,240
Greetings.
- Greetings.

986
01:30:49,444 --> 01:30:51,344
Mr Anand has sent this letter
for you.

987
01:30:54,782 --> 01:30:58,218
Look, please ask Mr Anand
to see me once.

988
01:30:58,786 --> 01:31:00,617
Very well.
- Tell him it is urgent.

989
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:03,214
Ask him to come this evening.
- Okay.

990
01:31:14,802 --> 01:31:17,635
Brother, does your head hurt?

991
01:31:19,073 --> 01:31:20,301
Yes, Raju.

992
01:31:42,763 --> 01:31:44,663
Just don't worry.

993
01:31:45,099 --> 01:31:46,999
Dr. Ghosh will reach there.

994
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:48,995
Here.

995
01:31:49,937 --> 01:31:52,167
What for?
- It is yours.

996
01:31:53,107 --> 01:31:55,007
Give it to the doctor.

997
01:31:55,309 --> 01:31:58,005
At least let me be help
in something so small.

998
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:00,208
Keep it.

999
01:32:01,716 --> 01:32:04,150
And listen, brother Mahesh
shouldn't get to know...

1000
01:32:04,785 --> 01:32:08,949
that we arranged for the doctor.
- I understand.

1001
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:14,623
That you are kind-hearted...
I always knew.

1002
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:17,960
But today I learn how
big-hearted you are.

1003
01:32:19,066 --> 01:32:22,297
The more I meet you,
the more I like it.

1004
01:32:24,739 --> 01:32:27,970
Please call a senior doctor.
- A senior doctor?

1005
01:32:28,409 --> 01:32:30,969
Yes. The case is getting
complicated.

1006
01:32:31,746 --> 01:32:37,309
Looking at the child's condition
you can only depend on doctor Ghosh.

1007
01:32:38,953 --> 01:32:41,319
Yes.
- But his fees will be very high.

1008
01:32:41,822 --> 01:32:44,655
Yes. I hear he doesn't
take a penny less.

1009
01:32:45,159 --> 01:32:47,252
Yet, he is a known
specialist.

1010
01:32:48,763 --> 01:32:49,661
Who?

1011
01:32:52,433 --> 01:32:54,162
Doctor.
- You are Mr Mahesh?

1012
01:32:54,435 --> 01:32:56,164
Yes.
- Your son is ill?

1013
01:33:13,154 --> 01:33:15,850
Show me your tongue, son.
- Nandu, your tongue.

1014
01:33:17,158 --> 01:33:18,284
Some more.

1015
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:20,325
Enough.

1016
01:33:25,399 --> 01:33:27,299
Okay, give me a piece of paper.
- Here it is.

1017
01:33:29,070 --> 01:33:30,970
What's his name?
- Nandu.

1018
01:33:34,008 --> 01:33:36,238
Send for this medicine
from my dispensary.

1019
01:33:36,877 --> 01:33:39,072
There's no need to worry.
Everything will be all right.

1020
01:33:40,081 --> 01:33:41,639
See you, doctor.

1021
01:33:43,751 --> 01:33:45,184
Doctor, your fees?

1022
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:48,354
Don't worry about that.
Send for the medicine first.

1023
01:33:48,823 --> 01:33:51,656
I'm must leave,
I'm in a hurry. Good day.

1024
01:33:54,762 --> 01:33:56,662
Anand?
You are still here?

1025
01:33:57,431 --> 01:34:00,594
I thought I'd ask you and go.
Nothing serious I hope?

1026
01:34:00,901 --> 01:34:04,029
It would be, if I'd been late.
It's para-typhoid.

1027
01:34:04,705 --> 01:34:07,265
Nothing to worry about, I hope.
- Nothing to worry. He'll be okay.

1028
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:11,106
Doctor, don't worry
about the expenses.

1029
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:14,875
Here's 200.
- Money from you?

1030
01:34:15,416 --> 01:34:17,213
It's not mine, but
on behalf of the mother.

1031
01:34:17,718 --> 01:34:21,051
Oh! Tell me, what relation do
you have with Nandu?

1032
01:34:23,724 --> 01:34:24,816
Relation?

1033
01:34:26,727 --> 01:34:29,958
When someone is very dear to you
inspite of not being related...

1034
01:34:30,731 --> 01:34:32,631
isn't it a wonderful relation?

1035
01:34:33,134 --> 01:34:35,625
You won't understand.
You won't.

1036
01:34:53,087 --> 01:34:55,817
Nandu, now you have
become completely all right.

1037
01:34:56,257 --> 01:34:59,658
When can I start eating food doctor?
- Wait for two days.

1038
01:35:00,094 --> 01:35:02,688
Then eat to your heart's content.
- All right.

1039
01:35:03,130 --> 01:35:04,791
I'll leave now.

1040
01:35:05,766 --> 01:35:07,199
Mr Mahesh...
- Yes?

1041
01:35:07,702 --> 01:35:11,297
There's no need to change the medicine.
Continue with it for two days.

1042
01:35:12,707 --> 01:35:13,605
Doctor...

1043
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:17,276
Will you tell me something?
- Go on.

1044
01:35:18,112 --> 01:35:20,171
You've been coming here
for so many days.

1045
01:35:20,715 --> 01:35:23,616
Neither did you take your fees
nor money for the medicine.

1046
01:35:24,118 --> 01:35:25,779
I don't understand this.

1047
01:35:26,087 --> 01:35:28,055
But I do understand.
- What?

1048
01:35:28,489 --> 01:35:30,616
That you are a simpleton.
- Meaning?

1049
01:35:30,958 --> 01:35:35,190
The child's mother gave me
money in advance.

1050
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:37,288
And you don't even know?

1051
01:35:37,832 --> 01:35:40,130
My dear man,
besides your office...

1052
01:35:40,468 --> 01:35:42,368
don't you know what's
happening in your house?

1053
01:35:49,543 --> 01:35:52,239
I don't understand this.
Who gave so much money?

1054
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:55,312
God knows.
Even I don't understand.

1055
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:57,782
It's amazing.

1056
01:35:58,152 --> 01:36:00,746
I'll find out at the clinic
while returning from work.

1057
01:36:01,689 --> 01:36:04,749
Listen, we must fix
the date to leave.

1058
01:36:05,192 --> 01:36:07,592
I've applied for leave
it'll be done soon.

1059
01:36:08,696 --> 01:36:10,596
I'm going to the village
after so many days...

1060
01:36:11,031 --> 01:36:14,592
I don't even have a nice sari.
Bring me one, please.

1061
01:36:15,035 --> 01:36:17,595
I'll get my salary today
I'll buy one.

1062
01:36:39,527 --> 01:36:41,290
My Nandu is absolutely
all right, isn't he?

1063
01:36:41,729 --> 01:36:44,789
Absolutely.
Give him sago even today.

1064
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:47,633
He can eat anything after two days.
- Very well.

1065
01:36:48,068 --> 01:36:50,628
We don't owe you any
of your fee, do we?

1066
01:36:51,071 --> 01:36:55,167
No. Now tell me something.
You've paid my fee...

1067
01:36:55,743 --> 01:37:00,237
why doesn't Mr Mahesh know about it?
- Well... actually.

1068
01:37:01,682 --> 01:37:03,309
I am not Nandu's natural
mother.

1069
01:37:25,172 --> 01:37:26,605
Pushpa, listen!

1070
01:37:32,713 --> 01:37:35,147
I made a grave mistake
in understanding you.

1071
01:37:36,717 --> 01:37:40,619
You have not only paid the doctor's
fees and money for the medicine...

1072
01:37:41,922 --> 01:37:44,152
you have given Nandu
a new lease of life.

1073
01:37:45,092 --> 01:37:47,219
I didn't have the
capacity to treat him.

1074
01:37:48,729 --> 01:37:52,631
I can never repay such
a big favor of yours.

1075
01:37:54,735 --> 01:37:57,829
I have misunderstood you.
Forgive me for that, sister.

1076
01:38:00,074 --> 01:38:01,905
Brother!
- Yes, sister.

1077
01:38:03,677 --> 01:38:06,908
Apart from respect and worship,
I can give you nothing else.

1078
01:38:08,849 --> 01:38:10,749
This is an ordinary sari.

1079
01:38:11,685 --> 01:38:13,585
The day-after-tomorrow is
Bhai Dooj (Brother's day).

1080
01:38:14,088 --> 01:38:16,249
Wear it on that day
as a remembrance of this brother.

1081
01:38:36,710 --> 01:38:37,608
Hey!

1082
01:38:38,112 --> 01:38:39,272
My son!

1083
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,275
Now you've become
absolutely all right.

1084
01:38:42,516 --> 01:38:43,380
Yes.

1085
01:38:43,717 --> 01:38:45,878
I've got a box of
biscuits for you.

1086
01:38:46,487 --> 01:38:48,955
But before that I'll
bring an amulet for you.

1087
01:39:02,670 --> 01:39:04,900
Whose amulet is this?
- The Goddess's.

1088
01:39:05,673 --> 01:39:08,574
I prayed to Her to cure you
soon.

1089
01:39:09,343 --> 01:39:11,243
Always keep this tied
on your arm.

1090
01:39:11,745 --> 01:39:15,010
You'll never fall ill.
- Is it made of gold?

1091
01:39:16,850 --> 01:39:20,149
You are my gold.
My darling boy.

1092
01:39:21,956 --> 01:39:23,856
Wait, I'll get biscuits for
you.

1093
01:39:37,705 --> 01:39:39,263
Where are you?

1094
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:43,606
Where is he?

1095
01:39:50,217 --> 01:39:56,622
Krishna sure is
a mischievous boy...

1096
01:39:57,224 --> 01:40:01,627
what will Mother Yashoda
do about it?

1097
01:40:04,732 --> 01:40:11,160
Krishna sure is
a mischievous boy...

1098
01:40:11,872 --> 01:40:17,640
what will Mother Yashoda
do about it?

1099
01:41:00,721 --> 01:41:06,887
Her eyes look for him...

1100
01:41:07,728 --> 01:41:14,634
where is Krishna hiding?

1101
01:41:15,169 --> 01:41:18,104
He flew away...

1102
01:41:18,739 --> 01:41:21,970
like the easterly winds...

1103
01:41:22,543 --> 01:41:25,637
what is Mother Yashoda to do?

1104
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:37,652
What is Mother Yashoda to do?

1105
01:41:41,028 --> 01:41:43,656
Krishna sure is
a mischievous lad

1106
01:42:15,129 --> 01:42:21,625
You are the only dream
I have had in life

1107
01:42:22,169 --> 01:42:25,627
Anyone who sets his eyes on
you...

1108
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:28,973
takes you for his own

1109
01:42:33,747 --> 01:42:36,238
Krishna, everybody loves...

1110
01:42:36,950 --> 01:42:40,386
for He plays the flute

1111
01:42:41,155 --> 01:42:44,318
what is Yashoda to do?

1112
01:42:52,166 --> 01:42:58,662
Krishna is certainly
a mischievous boy...

1113
01:42:59,206 --> 01:43:04,041
what is Mother Yashoda to do?

1114
01:43:11,952 --> 01:43:14,614
You know, we are going away
from here after two days?

1115
01:43:15,889 --> 01:43:19,290
Going away? Where to?
- To the village.

1116
01:43:20,727 --> 01:43:23,218
You'll leave me and go away?
- What do I do?

1117
01:43:23,897 --> 01:43:26,024
Everyone is leaving.
I'll have to go too.

1118
01:43:27,734 --> 01:43:32,068
You'll never meet me again.
- Why not? I'll come to meet you.

1119
01:43:33,740 --> 01:43:36,641
Just watch.
I'll surely come. May I go now?

1120
01:43:38,478 --> 01:43:39,843
Go, son.

1121
01:43:49,256 --> 01:43:52,157
Don't untie it!
- Let go!

1122
01:43:52,826 --> 01:43:55,056
You got that filthy woman to
tie an amulet on you?

1123
01:43:55,429 --> 01:43:57,329
Scoundrel!
Bindiya! Hey Bindiya!

1124
01:43:57,764 --> 01:43:59,322
Yes, madam.
- Return this to Pushpa!

1125
01:43:59,766 --> 01:44:02,166
And tell that witch!
She's a sinner anyway!

1126
01:44:02,703 --> 01:44:05,001
Why is she casting her spell
on children with this amulet?

1127
01:44:05,372 --> 01:44:06,930
Throw it in her face.

1128
01:44:07,174 --> 01:44:10,075
Listen, Nandu.
We'll be going after two days.

1129
01:44:10,711 --> 01:44:14,943
If you go there, I'll break
your bones, got it?!

1130
01:44:23,223 --> 01:44:24,952
Madam Pushpa! Madam Pushpa!

1131
01:44:26,793 --> 01:44:29,318
Yes?
- Here's your amulet.

1132
01:44:40,574 --> 01:44:42,872
Kamla, are you through?

1133
01:44:43,043 --> 01:44:46,809
Yes.
- So are we. I'll go and get the cart.

1134
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,399
Nandu! Come in!

1135
01:45:15,142 --> 01:45:16,871
You've cut your leg.
- That's okay.

1136
01:45:17,511 --> 01:45:19,741
I'll apply some lime,
it'll be all right.

1137
01:45:20,013 --> 01:45:24,416
No, I'll fetch some medicine.
- Hey, Nandu... it's okay!

1138
01:45:27,988 --> 01:45:32,322
Mother, brother is back.
- Is he?

1139
01:45:32,659 --> 01:45:33,125
What are you doing?

1140
01:45:33,860 --> 01:45:38,092
Where had you been?
What's in your hand? Show me!

1141
01:45:38,965 --> 01:45:41,957
Medicine? Who's hurt?
- She is!

1142
01:45:42,636 --> 01:45:46,538
You're now stealing
medicines for her?

1143
01:45:46,973 --> 01:45:49,134
Yes, I'll go! Leave me alone!
- Give it to me.

1144
01:45:49,643 --> 01:45:51,543
You talk back at me!

1145
01:45:55,649 --> 01:45:58,880
What audacity!
Just come back, I won't spare you.

1146
01:46:07,928 --> 01:46:09,828
What are you doing, silly
boy?

1147
01:46:10,597 --> 01:46:13,498
You brought medicine for me
and bandaged my wound?

1148
01:46:13,934 --> 01:46:15,834
So what happened?
- What happened?

1149
01:46:16,603 --> 01:46:18,503
You won't understand.

1150
01:46:18,972 --> 01:46:20,940
I'll never forget this day.

1151
01:46:23,610 --> 01:46:25,840
Will you go today itself?.
- Yes.

1152
01:46:26,279 --> 01:46:28,839
In a little while. Father has
gone to fetch the cart.

1153
01:46:30,117 --> 01:46:31,709
Then you won't meet me again?

1154
01:46:32,052 --> 01:46:35,510
Why not? When I grow up,
I'll come to meet you again.

1155
01:46:35,989 --> 01:46:39,117
To take my amulet.
You keep it carefully.

1156
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:41,887
Certainly, son.
I surely will.

1157
01:46:43,063 --> 01:46:45,861
Okay I'll go now.
Otherwise mother will beat me.

1158
01:46:46,867 --> 01:46:48,767
Go on, son.

1159
01:46:55,442 --> 01:46:57,034
Hey! What is this!

1160
01:46:57,644 --> 01:46:59,874
Being a Brahmin's son,
you touch my feet?

1161
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:04,014
You love me so much.
Then shouldn't I bow to you?

1162
01:47:07,587 --> 01:47:10,488
Go, my child.
May God keep you happy.

1163
01:47:12,592 --> 01:47:13,752
Go on.

1164
01:47:37,951 --> 01:47:39,851
Mother, brother is back.

1165
01:47:41,888 --> 01:47:46,052
You are back?
Rascal! Devil! Shameless wretch!

1166
01:47:47,761 --> 01:47:50,321
You went there? You bit me and
went to give her the medicine?

1167
01:47:50,964 --> 01:47:54,866
She means everything!
I'm nothing to you!

1168
01:47:55,202 --> 01:47:57,193
I won't spare you!
Never!

1169
01:47:57,704 --> 01:48:00,468
I'll skin you alive.
Answer me!

1170
01:48:00,841 --> 01:48:03,469
It's my wish! I'll go.
- You'll go there!

1171
01:48:03,944 --> 01:48:09,473
Yes, I'll go!
- You back answer me!

1172
01:48:15,589 --> 01:48:17,022
I won't spare you!

1173
01:48:17,290 --> 01:48:19,656
Will you go there?
- It's my wish! I'll go!

1174
01:48:21,962 --> 01:48:23,862
Please don't beat him.
It's not his fault.

1175
01:48:24,130 --> 01:48:27,031
Here! Here!
- I'll still go there.

1176
01:48:27,601 --> 01:48:33,005
He'll never come to my house again.
Please stop it.

1177
01:48:33,740 --> 01:48:35,833
You want to go there?
Go and die!

1178
01:48:38,912 --> 01:48:40,812
Why did you come?

1179
01:48:41,248 --> 01:48:44,081
Why did you come to my place?
- You had hurt your foot.

1180
01:48:44,518 --> 01:48:47,487
So what?
You should've let me die.

1181
01:48:48,154 --> 01:48:51,817
Tell me. Will you ever
come to me again? Tell me!

1182
01:48:52,325 --> 01:48:54,486
You will also stop me
from coming?

1183
01:48:55,929 --> 01:48:57,829
You also don't want me to come?

1184
01:48:58,932 --> 01:49:00,422
I won't come!

1185
01:49:00,934 --> 01:49:02,765
I won't ever come!

1186
01:49:03,870 --> 01:49:06,304
No, son.
How can I stop you?

1187
01:49:06,873 --> 01:49:09,433
But... but what do I do?

1188
01:49:14,881 --> 01:49:18,840
Go away from here! We'll be
leaving in a short while.

1189
01:49:19,319 --> 01:49:22,345
Before leaving, we don't want to
see a cursed woman's face!

1190
01:49:36,136 --> 01:49:40,129
Mother...

1191
01:49:59,259 --> 01:50:03,161
Pushpa, do you know
your Nandu is leaving?

1192
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:06,827
I do.

1193
01:50:37,097 --> 01:50:39,998
Are there many cars in Calcutta?
- Yes, many.

1194
01:50:40,767 --> 01:50:43,327
Double-decker buses too!
Huge ones.

1195
01:50:43,770 --> 01:50:46,830
Really?
- And many delicacies too!

1196
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:50,341
Samosas, jalebies, kachories.

1197
01:50:50,744 --> 01:50:54,009
Kachories? How are they?
- Absolutely delicious.

1198
01:50:55,115 --> 01:50:57,015
Your father used to
treat you everyday?

1199
01:50:57,450 --> 01:50:59,941
No.
- Then your new mother?

1200
01:51:00,487 --> 01:51:03,650
No! She gave it to me.
- Who's she?

1201
01:51:04,391 --> 01:51:08,293
She was so very nice.
She loved me so much.

1202
01:51:28,648 --> 01:51:30,548
Hey! Nandu babu!

1203
01:51:31,651 --> 01:51:33,551
You!
- Don't you recognize me?

1204
01:51:33,987 --> 01:51:36,785
Why will you recognize
your village friend?

1205
01:51:37,390 --> 01:51:39,551
That too, a matric-failed
Chander!

1206
01:51:41,327 --> 01:51:44,387
Sorry, I couldn't recognize you.
You've changed completely.

1207
01:51:44,898 --> 01:51:49,562
You expect a man to survive in
150 rupees and still not change?

1208
01:51:52,338 --> 01:51:56,035
What do you do?
- A sales agent of a fraud company.

1209
01:51:56,676 --> 01:51:59,577
I sell spurious oil and
toothpaste.

1210
01:52:00,113 --> 01:52:03,776
Forget it and tell me about yourself.
I've heard you've become an engineer?

1211
01:52:04,384 --> 01:52:07,615
Five years ago, I was in Patna.
I got transferred only last week.

1212
01:52:08,288 --> 01:52:10,188
And your family?
- They're still back there.

1213
01:52:10,623 --> 01:52:12,682
I'm looking for a house.
- Oh I see!

1214
01:52:13,293 --> 01:52:15,659
But how come you are here
early in the morning?

1215
01:52:16,096 --> 01:52:18,860
I was passing by. Suddenly
I stopped looking at this place.

1216
01:52:19,566 --> 01:52:21,864
Something special about it?
- Yes.

1217
01:52:22,736 --> 01:52:23,634
Look.

1218
01:52:24,637 --> 01:52:28,539
The sewage of the entire city
flows through this gutter...

1219
01:52:29,309 --> 01:52:31,209
into the holy Ganges.

1220
01:52:32,979 --> 01:52:36,380
After that, it no longer remains dirty.
It becomes holy water.

1221
01:52:37,884 --> 01:52:40,580
This place reminds me of someone.
- Who?

1222
01:52:41,755 --> 01:52:43,382
There was a lady.

1223
01:52:44,324 --> 01:52:46,554
Her life was also
like this gutter.

1224
01:52:47,327 --> 01:52:50,228
But her heart was as pure
as the holy Ganges.

1225
01:52:50,663 --> 01:52:53,564
But who was she?
- No relative of mine.

1226
01:52:54,334 --> 01:52:55,892
But the love she gave me...

1227
01:52:56,402 --> 01:52:58,427
perhaps my own mother
wouldn't have been able to.

1228
01:53:00,140 --> 01:53:01,767
I am glad to meet you.

1229
01:53:02,275 --> 01:53:04,175
Okay, I'll leave now.
I'm getting late.

1230
01:53:04,444 --> 01:53:08,744
I've got to go and sell oil.
See you again sometime.

1231
01:53:10,283 --> 01:53:13,844
Look for a house,
I'll drop in for tea someday.

1232
01:53:14,287 --> 01:53:16,187
Sure.
- Okay, bye.

1233
01:53:24,264 --> 01:53:26,698
Hey, dunce!
Why are you shouting?

1234
01:53:27,133 --> 01:53:29,363
Is mother Ganges deaf?.
- Of course.

1235
01:53:29,803 --> 01:53:31,862
I've been worshipping her
for 14 years.

1236
01:53:32,472 --> 01:53:35,373
What did she give me?
Ajob to sell oil...

1237
01:53:35,809 --> 01:53:39,370
that too, after screaming
at the top of my voice!

1238
01:53:42,081 --> 01:53:44,379
Being a Brahmin's son
he sells oil, poor fellow.

1239
01:53:44,884 --> 01:53:48,513
Destiny! I must see his
horoscope someday.

1240
01:53:49,155 --> 01:53:51,988
Brother, read my hand. I got
you with great difficulty today.

1241
01:53:52,492 --> 01:53:54,983
Look, I've washed my
hands clean with soap.

1242
01:53:55,562 --> 01:53:57,792
What's this?
You used my soap?

1243
01:53:58,164 --> 01:54:00,997
Give it to me! Now go away!
You are not a conjurer...

1244
01:54:01,434 --> 01:54:03,095
to make me dance anywhere.

1245
01:54:15,114 --> 01:54:17,674
Hey, old hag!
Are you deaf?.

1246
01:54:18,117 --> 01:54:21,518
The man in room number 7 is
asking for water, go quickly!

1247
01:54:22,455 --> 01:54:24,355
I'll go.
- And these vessels?

1248
01:54:24,791 --> 01:54:26,918
Damn it! You haven't
washed them as yet.

1249
01:54:27,460 --> 01:54:30,361
It's time for the boys to
leave, when will I cook?

1250
01:54:31,464 --> 01:54:33,022
God! Wonder how my horse lost?!

1251
01:54:33,466 --> 01:54:36,367
His father had won two derbies.
- Forget it, Shamu.

1252
01:54:36,870 --> 01:54:38,770
When our forefather's
didn't leave anything for us.

1253
01:54:39,038 --> 01:54:41,370
What will the poor horses do?
- Who will win the match?

1254
01:54:42,175 --> 01:54:43,904
Mohan Bagan?
- East Bengal.

1255
01:54:46,479 --> 01:54:49,380
Is there a ghost behind you?
- Sorry.

1256
01:54:49,616 --> 01:54:52,585
Put some water.
- Water? Please give this.

1257
01:54:54,554 --> 01:54:56,044
Here you are.

1258
01:55:00,159 --> 01:55:04,425
Hey Ramu, son-of-a-gun!
- How can I become a father, sir?

1259
01:55:05,098 --> 01:55:10,559
I think serving you day and night,
I'll die a bachelor, Mr Pundri.

1260
01:55:11,104 --> 01:55:14,164
Not Pundri! Pundri Katch!
- Sorry Pundri Katch!

1261
01:55:14,474 --> 01:55:16,999
Where were you?
- Where wasn't I?

1262
01:55:17,443 --> 01:55:19,001
I'd gone to fetch
rasogollas for Mr Ghanshyam.

1263
01:55:19,245 --> 01:55:21,475
Tobacco for that fatso Maharaj.

1264
01:55:21,781 --> 01:55:26,445
To polish Sitaram's shoes. And...
- Shut up!

1265
01:55:27,120 --> 01:55:30,351
I told you to fill
my earthen pot at night.

1266
01:55:30,790 --> 01:55:34,021
If I don't get water in the morning,
I get an upset stomach.

1267
01:55:34,494 --> 01:55:37,019
Go and get it.
- At once.

1268
01:55:40,733 --> 01:55:43,964
Give this water to the gentleman.
- But it is for room no. 7.

1269
01:55:44,404 --> 01:55:46,964
Forget room no. 7.
Mr Pundri will drink it first.

1270
01:55:47,307 --> 01:55:49,639
Otherwise he'll have an
upset stomach, get it?

1271
01:55:52,078 --> 01:55:56,981
Sir, please read my palm and
tell me when will I get married?

1272
01:55:57,417 --> 01:56:00,978
When you die! Rascal!
Making fun of my art!

1273
01:56:01,688 --> 01:56:05,249
It's 9, will we be late?
- Yes, even if we...

1274
01:56:21,708 --> 01:56:22,606
You!

1275
01:56:23,776 --> 01:56:24,936
Here!

1276
01:56:26,245 --> 01:56:29,009
I want to ask you
the same question. You...

1277
01:56:31,117 --> 01:56:32,015
here?

1278
01:56:33,186 --> 01:56:35,086
I work here.

1279
01:56:38,791 --> 01:56:41,191
Are you okay?
- Wrong.

1280
01:56:42,261 --> 01:56:44,627
You should ask whether
I'm happy or not.

1281
01:56:48,201 --> 01:56:50,101
What is it, Anand?
Was the servant...

1282
01:56:58,411 --> 01:56:59,639
What's this?

1283
01:56:59,912 --> 01:57:03,905
You see me after so many years
and you start crying?

1284
01:57:05,685 --> 01:57:08,984
You forget....
Wipe your tears.

1285
01:57:11,257 --> 01:57:13,919
I have seen many ups
and downs in life.

1286
01:57:14,694 --> 01:57:18,130
I thought, nothing would
surprise me anymore.

1287
01:57:19,699 --> 01:57:21,929
But I am, after seeing you
today.

1288
01:57:23,069 --> 01:57:25,264
But this place is better
than the place...

1289
01:57:26,139 --> 01:57:28,039
where I previously was,
isn't it?

1290
01:57:31,377 --> 01:57:34,039
Wherever you stay,
you won't change.

1291
01:57:35,381 --> 01:57:38,612
First you cleanse dirt
from people's hearts.

1292
01:57:39,252 --> 01:57:42,050
Now you wash
their dirty vessels.

1293
01:57:43,389 --> 01:57:49,624
By touching the dirt in this world,
you purify it.

1294
01:57:50,897 --> 01:57:52,296
You know...

1295
01:57:55,735 --> 01:57:57,965
I met you after so
many years...

1296
01:57:59,005 --> 01:58:01,906
but I never felt
I was away from you.

1297
01:58:04,677 --> 01:58:07,578
Come on, Anand.
Mr Chatterjee is waiting for us.

1298
01:58:09,682 --> 01:58:12,583
A penny for your thoughts.
What's the matter?

1299
01:58:13,219 --> 01:58:16,916
This servant Pushpa...
is it an old affair?

1300
01:58:19,125 --> 01:58:22,151
You are a share market broker.
You won't understand.

1301
01:58:26,365 --> 01:58:30,859
There are things in life
which one enjoys...

1302
01:58:31,370 --> 01:58:34,931
when one deliberately
suffers a loss!

1303
01:58:36,709 --> 01:58:38,973
You won't understand.
Come on.

1304
01:58:41,747 --> 01:58:45,410
Okay, Ramratan I'll leave now.
I've got to take the 8.10 train.

1305
01:58:50,523 --> 01:58:52,423
Look after him, he's very
ill.

1306
01:58:57,864 --> 01:58:59,092
Here.

1307
01:59:02,535 --> 01:59:04,025
Who are you?

1308
01:59:06,472 --> 01:59:09,703
I... I am the new maid here.

1309
01:59:11,477 --> 01:59:14,708
Where is Ramu?
- I don't know.

1310
01:59:16,482 --> 01:59:20,816
I was so very thirsty.
Because I'm blind...

1311
01:59:23,656 --> 01:59:28,389
I can't even take
water on my own.

1312
01:59:43,209 --> 01:59:46,007
Sister-in-law!
Brother has got a second wife!

1313
01:59:46,512 --> 01:59:47,410
What?

1314
01:59:52,251 --> 01:59:54,151
He has brought her along.

1315
02:00:04,197 --> 02:00:10,295
Think her as your younger sister and
mind you, she should have no problem.

1316
02:00:11,103 --> 02:00:15,437
But... without telling me?
- It was not necessary. Come on.

1317
02:00:26,552 --> 02:00:28,782
Here you are.
Have you left?

1318
02:00:30,556 --> 02:00:34,151
If you see Ramu around,
please send him in.

1319
02:00:35,428 --> 02:00:37,328
I have a splitting headache.

1320
02:00:38,431 --> 02:00:40,331
Very well. I'll send him.

1321
02:00:58,884 --> 02:01:01,614
Looking for something, sir?
- Yes.

1322
02:01:02,388 --> 02:01:07,291
Many years ago Durga, Jharna
and many girls stayed there.

1323
02:01:07,727 --> 02:01:11,288
They left long ago.
Some even say Jharna is dead.

1324
02:01:16,068 --> 02:01:19,629
And in that house lived
a girl called Pushpa.

1325
02:01:20,072 --> 02:01:22,768
There's no news of her.
She left long ago.

1326
02:01:26,412 --> 02:01:28,312
Is that opposite
house vacant?

1327
02:01:28,681 --> 02:01:31,844
Yes, go and take a look.
Talk to that watchman.

1328
02:01:32,652 --> 02:01:34,313
Thank you.
- Good day.

1329
02:01:39,425 --> 02:01:45,728
Come, let me embrace you...

1330
02:01:46,832 --> 02:01:49,824
may no one cast an evil eye
at you

1331
02:01:50,436 --> 02:01:53,030
let me hide you in my heart

1332
02:01:57,943 --> 02:02:04,280
Come, let me embrace you

1333
02:02:05,084 --> 02:02:08,611
Lest someone casts an
evil eye at you...

1334
02:02:09,021 --> 02:02:11,888
let me hide you in my heart

1335
02:02:12,725 --> 02:02:15,626
The world is the scorching
sun...

1336
02:02:16,395 --> 02:02:19,296
and a mother is soothing shade

1337
02:02:20,066 --> 02:02:24,628
What is Mother Yashoda to do?

1338
02:02:27,173 --> 02:02:30,301
Krishna is indeed
very mischievous

1339
02:02:42,822 --> 02:02:49,660
You are the only dream
I have had in life

1340
02:02:50,429 --> 02:02:53,330
Everyone who sets his
eyes on you...

1341
02:02:53,999 --> 02:02:56,763
takes you for his own

1342
02:02:57,770 --> 02:03:00,261
Krishna, everybody loves...

1343
02:03:01,073 --> 02:03:04,270
for He plays the flute

1344
02:03:05,044 --> 02:03:09,276
What is Mother Yashoda to do?

1345
02:03:12,385 --> 02:03:13,909
Krishna is indeed
very mischievous

1346
02:03:14,120 --> 02:03:15,951
Send for this medicine.
- Okay.

1347
02:03:16,389 --> 02:03:18,619
If necessary, I'll give
an injection later.

1348
02:03:25,498 --> 02:03:27,830
Doctor, your fees?
- Four rupees.

1349
02:03:28,401 --> 02:03:31,302
Four rupees?
I only have two.

1350
02:03:32,071 --> 02:03:33,971
And I have to renew
the monthly pass too.

1351
02:03:34,407 --> 02:03:36,307
Should I give some?
- You?

1352
02:03:36,575 --> 02:03:40,636
I have some.
- You'd better inform his relatives.

1353
02:03:41,080 --> 02:03:44,880
His relatives? He has no one.
Which is why I brought him here.

1354
02:03:49,088 --> 02:03:51,852
He had two wives.
He left the first one.

1355
02:03:52,525 --> 02:03:54,425
And the second one
committed suicide.

1356
02:03:54,760 --> 02:03:57,661
Here you are.
- Here you are, doctor.

1357
02:04:00,366 --> 02:04:03,767
May God help you.
Keep these two rupees.

1358
02:04:04,370 --> 02:04:06,702
No, you've to buy
his medicine too.

1359
02:04:07,373 --> 02:04:11,275
That's right. There's milk near the
stove. Warm it up and give it to him.

1360
02:04:11,777 --> 02:04:14,268
I'll fetch the medicine.
I'm already late for work.

1361
02:04:55,020 --> 02:04:56,988
I won't go!
- Out, I say!

1362
02:04:58,424 --> 02:05:00,255
I won't leave this
house and go away.

1363
02:05:00,693 --> 02:05:01,921
Why won't you?

1364
02:05:02,361 --> 02:05:05,592
Listen carefully.
Either she stays here or me?

1365
02:05:05,764 --> 02:05:08,961
Barren-woman!
Throw her out!

1366
02:05:09,335 --> 02:05:13,237
Will you go or not?
- No! Kill me! Cut me to pieces!

1367
02:05:14,039 --> 02:05:16,906
But I won't leave you.
- You won't?

1368
02:05:17,776 --> 02:05:19,573
You won't budge like this.

1369
02:05:31,323 --> 02:05:33,553
Pick up your clothes
and get lost!

1370
02:06:28,314 --> 02:06:29,212
Here.

1371
02:06:31,383 --> 02:06:33,681
Samosas?
- Yes, brother-in-law got it.

1372
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:36,720
You love them a lot?
- A lot!

1373
02:06:38,390 --> 02:06:39,288
Madam.

1374
02:06:39,992 --> 02:06:42,222
Madam, he's been crying
a lot today.

1375
02:06:45,497 --> 02:06:48,295
He has fever, I think.

1376
02:06:49,335 --> 02:06:50,233
Yes.

1377
02:06:51,003 --> 02:06:52,903
Don't worry.
I'll bring the doctor.

1378
02:06:58,344 --> 02:06:59,242
Enough!

1379
02:07:00,279 --> 02:07:02,509
Nothing to worry about.
It'sjust a common fever.

1380
02:07:03,282 --> 02:07:06,183
I'll prescribe medicines for two
days. Everything will be all right.

1381
02:07:07,286 --> 02:07:08,844
With your touch, certainly.

1382
02:07:09,355 --> 02:07:10,913
Perhaps you don't
remember, doctor...

1383
02:07:11,357 --> 02:07:13,723
you had cured his father too.

1384
02:07:15,527 --> 02:07:18,724
When his father, that's me;
I was 8 years old then.

1385
02:07:19,632 --> 02:07:21,862
What's your name?
- Nand Kishore Sharma.

1386
02:07:23,369 --> 02:07:24,529
Remember?

1387
02:07:26,405 --> 02:07:28,703
Yes, now I remember.

1388
02:07:29,308 --> 02:07:31,208
Great!
After all these years?

1389
02:07:31,810 --> 02:07:35,211
I was in Patna; recently
I got transferred to Calcutta.

1390
02:07:35,681 --> 02:07:38,809
Oh! What do you do here?
- I'm an engineer in the corporation.

1391
02:07:41,387 --> 02:07:45,221
Here, send for this medicine.
Nothing to worry about.

1392
02:07:46,859 --> 02:07:49,555
If need be, send for me.
- Sure.

1393
02:07:49,928 --> 02:07:50,826
Bye.

1394
02:07:54,333 --> 02:07:57,769
What is it, Ramu?
- The man in room no 7 is dead.

1395
02:07:58,337 --> 02:07:59,736
Mr Ramratan?
- Yes.

1396
02:08:06,645 --> 02:08:08,704
Doctor...
- Yes?

1397
02:08:09,281 --> 02:08:12,614
Write a death certificate.
- Come with me.

1398
02:08:25,698 --> 02:08:28,189
I was shattered at heart
first...

1399
02:08:28,734 --> 02:08:31,635
I break my bangles
in widowhood now

1400
02:08:32,304 --> 02:08:37,207
All my dreams
lie shattered

1401
02:08:38,977 --> 02:08:44,882
There blew a string wind...

1402
02:08:45,584 --> 02:08:49,611
which ruined my world

1403
02:08:52,324 --> 02:08:56,954
My right to look beautiful...

1404
02:08:57,896 --> 02:09:03,493
my right to look beautiful
is now no more, God

1405
02:09:05,938 --> 02:09:10,602
In a palanquin...

1406
02:09:12,277 --> 02:09:17,180
I've been brought
to my husband's house

1407
02:09:39,505 --> 02:09:42,406
Anand! Come on in.
Where have you been?

1408
02:09:42,875 --> 02:09:45,105
Sit down.
Are you okay?

1409
02:09:45,644 --> 02:09:48,772
Can't I come to visit you
unless I'm ill?

1410
02:09:50,048 --> 02:09:53,108
I felt like catching up
with all old acquaintances.

1411
02:09:53,886 --> 02:09:58,118
So I'm here. I have no problem,
neither physical nor mental...

1412
02:09:58,557 --> 02:10:00,457
I'm happy and peaceful.

1413
02:10:01,160 --> 02:10:04,789
Peace and happiness in today's world?
What formula have you found, sir?

1414
02:10:08,300 --> 02:10:10,393
Open the doors to your mind.

1415
02:10:11,069 --> 02:10:16,029
And peace and happiness
will blow in like a wind.

1416
02:10:17,242 --> 02:10:21,804
Take me for instance. I always
kept the doors of my mind shut.

1417
02:10:23,182 --> 02:10:26,151
I used to visit brothels,
I was a heavy drinker.

1418
02:10:26,652 --> 02:10:31,316
And I thought I'd find happiness
in these things. I was wrong.

1419
02:10:31,990 --> 02:10:35,153
And from the time I've
well-ventilated my mind doctor...

1420
02:10:35,694 --> 02:10:42,224
I stopped everything. I found peace
and happiness on my own.

1421
02:10:44,269 --> 02:10:47,830
How can you stop drinking?
- I just did.

1422
02:10:50,209 --> 02:10:52,939
And my wife too.
- Wife too?

1423
02:10:53,745 --> 02:10:55,440
No, actually I put it
wrongly.

1424
02:10:55,981 --> 02:11:00,213
Actually my wife left me.
It was a dilemma for her really.

1425
02:11:00,686 --> 02:11:03,177
On one hand was the hubby,
on the other were the parties.

1426
02:11:04,223 --> 02:11:05,781
Which party?

1427
02:11:15,234 --> 02:11:17,134
Forget it. You tell me
about yourself.

1428
02:11:18,003 --> 02:11:20,130
How are you?
- I'm fine.

1429
02:11:20,906 --> 02:11:23,466
But I never imagined
you'd change so much.

1430
02:11:24,243 --> 02:11:27,406
Such a drastic change?
- It happens, doctor.

1431
02:11:29,081 --> 02:11:31,914
The course of life is
not always smooth.

1432
02:11:32,918 --> 02:11:34,818
There is a turning somewhere.

1433
02:11:38,724 --> 02:11:41,318
You forgot, Pushpa?
How can you?

1434
02:11:41,927 --> 02:11:45,829
Pushpa! Whose foster-son
you had treated!

1435
02:11:52,271 --> 02:11:55,934
That very Pushpa ventilated
my heart and mind.

1436
02:11:56,942 --> 02:12:01,106
I see. Look at the co-incidence.
That boy Nandu...

1437
02:12:01,880 --> 02:12:03,780
is an engineer in
the corporation here.

1438
02:12:04,216 --> 02:12:08,778
And stays right here in this locality.
- Really? He must have grown very big.

1439
02:12:09,888 --> 02:12:15,292
What's more, his son recently
fell ill and I'm treating him too.

1440
02:12:19,231 --> 02:12:21,791
Here he is! Come, Nandu.

1441
02:12:24,102 --> 02:12:26,468
Greetings.
- We just mentioned your name.

1442
02:12:27,105 --> 02:12:29,801
You'll live a hundred years.
- What is the use of just saying that?

1443
02:12:30,409 --> 02:12:32,969
There should be someone
to give me this blessing.

1444
02:12:34,079 --> 02:12:35,307
Why not?

1445
02:12:36,448 --> 02:12:41,147
I'll bless you! May you
live a thousand years.

1446
02:12:42,354 --> 02:12:44,481
You...?
- Don't you recognize me?

1447
02:12:45,590 --> 02:12:48,491
When you were small, you'd
come to Pushpa's house.

1448
02:12:49,261 --> 02:12:52,389
I would bring samosas,
kachories and sweets for you?

1449
02:12:53,932 --> 02:12:55,422
Remember?
- You!

1450
02:12:57,936 --> 02:12:59,836
Mr Anand!
- Remember now?

1451
02:13:01,873 --> 02:13:04,103
Did your son get fever again?

1452
02:13:04,676 --> 02:13:07,201
No.
- Then stop the medicine.

1453
02:13:07,579 --> 02:13:08,477
Okay.

1454
02:13:10,482 --> 02:13:13,781
Is the blossoming dale tree
you planted, still there?

1455
02:13:14,653 --> 02:13:17,554
Yes. I've bought a flat
opposite that very house.

1456
02:13:18,223 --> 02:13:21,215
Really? Are the flowers blossoming?
- Many!

1457
02:13:22,361 --> 02:13:25,455
I want to see it.
Will you show me?

1458
02:13:26,565 --> 02:13:29,466
Come on.
- Let's go. Okay, doctor.

1459
02:13:34,106 --> 02:13:37,337
Do you know where she is?

1460
02:13:38,910 --> 02:13:39,968
She?

1461
02:13:40,979 --> 02:13:42,139
Pushpa?

1462
02:13:44,416 --> 02:13:46,816
You are longing to see her?
- Very much.

1463
02:13:48,587 --> 02:13:51,249
Do you want to meet her?
- Yes.

1464
02:13:53,025 --> 02:13:55,493
Let's go. Take a look at her.

1465
02:13:57,262 --> 02:13:58,820
Good bye, doctor.

1466
02:13:59,931 --> 02:14:01,364
Hey old hag!

1467
02:14:01,900 --> 02:14:05,267
What are you doing?
Wash that big vessel soon.

1468
02:14:09,875 --> 02:14:12,435
Look who is here.
Look!

1469
02:14:24,222 --> 02:14:26,782
Recognize him?
Or must I tell you his name?

1470
02:14:30,228 --> 02:14:35,461
See? You're just staring in amazement,
but Pushpa sure recognized you.

1471
02:14:36,401 --> 02:14:40,804
I never ever forgot.
Can this face ever be forgotten?

1472
02:14:41,907 --> 02:14:44,137
Talk to your son.
I'll just come.

1473
02:14:45,377 --> 02:14:47,470
Come, son.
Let's sit there.

1474
02:14:49,915 --> 02:14:53,817
You've grown taller than me.
But you haven't changed at all.

1475
02:14:55,187 --> 02:14:58,350
The same big eyes,
the same innocent face.

1476
02:14:59,925 --> 02:15:00,755
Come.

1477
02:15:03,295 --> 02:15:05,195
Sit down, son.

1478
02:15:08,200 --> 02:15:10,760
What have you done to yourself?.

1479
02:15:11,536 --> 02:15:14,767
But you're okay, aren't you?
I remembered you only yesterday.

1480
02:15:15,373 --> 02:15:18,774
I once cut my finger while
chopping vegetables, remember?

1481
02:15:21,580 --> 02:15:25,346
I've preserved the bandage
you had tied.

1482
02:15:26,885 --> 02:15:28,785
You have something else too.

1483
02:15:31,556 --> 02:15:33,456
My amulet. Remember?

1484
02:15:34,392 --> 02:15:37,225
I had told you I'd come
back for it.

1485
02:15:38,897 --> 02:15:40,797
Yes... I remember.

1486
02:15:41,967 --> 02:15:45,061
Will you give it to me?
For your grandson.

1487
02:15:46,471 --> 02:15:47,802
My grandson...?

1488
02:15:48,573 --> 02:15:49,801
Your son?

1489
02:15:50,675 --> 02:15:51,573
Yes.

1490
02:15:52,611 --> 02:15:54,806
I was going to take him to
the Goddess' temple today.

1491
02:15:57,249 --> 02:16:01,413
And I found you.
- Wait, son. I'll go and get it.

1492
02:16:22,874 --> 02:16:26,105
Good Lord!
Where the hell is that woman?

1493
02:16:26,945 --> 02:16:30,210
Hey old hag! Who'll wash
all this? Your father?

1494
02:16:30,649 --> 02:16:32,446
Wait, I'll do it.

1495
02:16:33,084 --> 02:16:37,111
What? The bloody shirker!
I'll find a new maid today!

1496
02:16:38,023 --> 02:16:41,049
It's a sin to employ these
whores at work! Great sin!

1497
02:16:43,895 --> 02:16:44,793
Here.

1498
02:16:53,104 --> 02:16:56,335
Look, I've got samosas
and kachories for your son.

1499
02:16:57,242 --> 02:16:59,142
Give it to him.

1500
02:17:07,018 --> 02:17:08,246
Eat, son.

1501
02:17:10,322 --> 02:17:12,085
Not only me...

1502
02:17:12,524 --> 02:17:15,755
Even Mr Anand remembers everything.
- You remember, Nandu?

1503
02:17:16,661 --> 02:17:18,754
You loved to eat this
as a child.

1504
02:17:19,864 --> 02:17:22,890
It's hot, it'll become cold.
Eat it up.

1505
02:17:24,469 --> 02:17:26,027
Hey Queen!

1506
02:17:26,538 --> 02:17:29,098
What are you doing there?
Come and wash these vessels!

1507
02:17:32,978 --> 02:17:34,775
Is he a man or a beast?

1508
02:17:35,880 --> 02:17:38,110
Hey! Tears in your eyes?

1509
02:17:40,018 --> 02:17:42,919
Mr Anand...
how do I explain it to you?

1510
02:17:43,355 --> 02:17:47,314
I understand everything.
You don't have to tell me anything.

1511
02:17:48,893 --> 02:17:50,793
Wipe the tears.

1512
02:17:51,997 --> 02:17:56,297
Have you washed them? Are you blind?
Look, how greasy it is!

1513
02:17:57,068 --> 02:18:01,061
My finger is cut, perhaps...
- Your finger is cut!

1514
02:18:01,539 --> 02:18:05,066
Hey delicate darling.
If that's the case, leave thisjob.

1515
02:18:05,543 --> 02:18:08,171
Go and dance somewhere.
- Shut up!

1516
02:18:09,848 --> 02:18:11,338
This is great!

1517
02:18:11,850 --> 02:18:15,217
Who are you to shout at me?
- Mind your tongue.

1518
02:18:15,854 --> 02:18:19,255
What happened?
- Look! Wonder how they came here?

1519
02:18:19,858 --> 02:18:22,759
I was scolding my servant
and they got angry.

1520
02:18:23,295 --> 02:18:26,423
Who are you?
- An old flame of this whore!

1521
02:18:27,332 --> 02:18:32,326
One more word against her
and I'll break yourjaws!

1522
02:18:33,338 --> 02:18:35,772
I won't say a word.

1523
02:18:38,109 --> 02:18:41,101
Sir, you are supporting
our maid a lot?

1524
02:18:41,546 --> 02:18:46,449
What is so special about her?
- There is, son. There is.

1525
02:18:52,991 --> 02:18:55,323
Doesn't she remind you
of your mother?

1526
02:19:03,001 --> 02:19:05,401
This is the time to
repay your old debts.

1527
02:19:06,271 --> 02:19:08,398
Debts? What debts.

1528
02:19:09,541 --> 02:19:12,101
The debt of motherhood.
Of being a child once.

1529
02:19:12,844 --> 02:19:15,745
This is the time, Nandu.
Take your mother home.

1530
02:19:16,848 --> 02:19:17,746
No.

1531
02:19:18,249 --> 02:19:19,147
Mother.

1532
02:19:20,852 --> 02:19:24,913
I won't listen to you.
Today you'll have to come with me.

1533
02:19:26,558 --> 02:19:28,185
Today is the festival of Durga.

1534
02:19:28,560 --> 02:19:31,085
On this day, devotees take
the Goddess Durga home.

1535
02:19:31,963 --> 02:19:34,295
If my mother does not
come to my house today...

1536
02:19:34,933 --> 02:19:39,461
I'll think that love, affection,
attachment... is all a farce!

1537
02:19:40,939 --> 02:19:44,204
But... but...
- No buts today.

1538
02:19:45,043 --> 02:19:47,170
Your son is taking you home,
go on!

1539
02:19:47,612 --> 02:19:50,103
Come on, mother.
- Yes, yes Pushpa.

1540
02:19:50,882 --> 02:19:51,780
Go.

1541
02:20:03,895 --> 02:20:05,453
Rickshaw... stop.

1542
02:20:09,901 --> 02:20:11,129
Get in.

1543
02:20:11,236 --> 02:20:12,794
That's okay.

1544
02:20:14,339 --> 02:20:16,330
Bless you, son. Go on.

1545
02:20:31,456 --> 02:20:32,821
What's this?

1546
02:20:33,591 --> 02:20:35,252
Tears in your eyes?

1547
02:20:35,627 --> 02:20:38,528
Tears...? In my eyes?

1548
02:20:41,366 --> 02:20:42,492
Oh yes!

1549
02:20:44,035 --> 02:20:45,935
But how did they flow?

1550
02:20:48,473 --> 02:20:50,839
You who always wiped
people's tears...

1551
02:20:51,543 --> 02:20:53,443
is there no one
to wipe your tears?

1552
02:20:54,946 --> 02:20:58,848
Let them flow, Pushpa.
They come with great difficulty.

1553
02:20:59,951 --> 02:21:06,049
I didn't know crying is such
a pleasure. I'll never say that...

1554
02:21:10,962 --> 02:21:13,192
Really, you didn't get
anything in life.

1555
02:21:13,965 --> 02:21:20,461
You didn't take anything from anyone.
You only gave, only distributed.

1556
02:21:21,272 --> 02:21:25,936
Go, Pushpa.
Your son is waiting for you.

1557
02:21:27,345 --> 02:21:30,803
I'm going.
I got so much from you...

1558
02:21:32,083 --> 02:21:35,814
but couldn't give you anything
in return. And today...

1559
02:21:36,921 --> 02:21:41,153
while going, I'm taking once again.
The dust of your feet.

1560
02:21:48,533 --> 02:21:50,831
On reaching home look
at the blooming dale, Pushpa.

1561
02:21:51,936 --> 02:21:54,302
A lot of flowers have
blossomed.

1562
02:21:56,274 --> 02:21:58,834
Take your mother away, Nandu.

1563
02:22:13,658 --> 02:22:14,955
Go on.

1564
02:23:15,353 --> 02:23:18,789
This is Immortal Love
