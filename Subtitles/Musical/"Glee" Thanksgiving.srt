MARLEY: <i>When I was seven years</i>
<i>old, I had a dream.</i>

49
00:03:11,727 --> 00:03:14,145
<i>It's the first one</i>
<i>I actually remember.</i>

50
00:03:14,179 --> 00:03:17,398
<i>I was alone... on a stage</i>

51
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:19,734
<i>wearing a beautiful dress.</i>

52
00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:21,286
<i>I couldn't see the audience,</i>

53
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,405
<i>but I could feel</i>
<i>the full house.</i>

54
00:03:24,456 --> 00:03:30,745
<i>They had all come for one</i>
<i>reason: to hear me sing.</i>

55
00:03:30,796 --> 00:03:34,833
<i>And now, thanks to Glee Club,</i>
<i>with sectionals this week,</i>

56
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:36,718
<i>that dream is about</i>
<i>to come true.</i>

57
00:03:36,752 --> 00:03:38,920
<i>Well, except the part where</i>
<i>Skeet Ulrich gave me</i>

58
00:03:38,971 --> 00:03:40,388
<i>a bouquet of kittens</i>
<i>at the end.</i>

59
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:42,423
<i>My dreams are weird.</i>

60
00:03:42,474 --> 00:03:44,509
<i>Mom's doing great</i>
<i>with her diet.</i>

61
00:03:44,543 --> 00:03:46,060
<i>She's lost 12 pounds!</i>

62
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:48,229
<i>I haven't lost quite as much,</i>

63
00:03:48,264 --> 00:03:50,648
<i>but I'm pretty sure I can see</i>
<i>a difference.</i>

64
00:03:50,683 --> 00:03:53,067
<i>I'm not letting up</i>
<i>until after sectionals, though.</i>

65
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:57,438
<i>I've got to look my best</i>
<i>up there.</i>

66
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:00,191
<i>I just want to be great</i>
<i>for all of them.</i>

67
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:02,861
<i>I can feel how much</i>
<i>they're depending on me.</i>

68
00:04:02,895 --> 00:04:04,445
<i>I can't let them down.</i>

69
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:06,364
<i>Especially them.</i>

70
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:09,584
<i>The pressure is on,</i>
<i>Marley Rose,</i>

71
00:04:09,618 --> 00:04:11,502
<i>and it's like Mom always</i>
<i>says...</i>

72
00:04:11,537 --> 00:04:13,288
Don't blow it.

73
00:04:13,339 --> 00:04:16,207
PUCK: So I said, "You girls are
gonna need another cup."

74
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:18,343
(laughter)

75
00:04:18,377 --> 00:04:21,346
Yeah, but, guys, I'd like
to propose a toast:

76
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,014
To almost all of us keeping
our promise

77
00:04:23,048 --> 00:04:24,182
to come home for Thanksgiving.

78
00:04:24,216 --> 00:04:25,633
Cheers!
Cheers!

79
00:04:25,684 --> 00:04:26,584
Here's to us.

80
00:04:26,602 --> 00:04:29,854
Has anybody heard
from Rachel or Kurt?

81
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:31,306
No. I know Blaine's been

82
00:04:31,357 --> 00:04:33,858
texting him, but
Kurt won't text back.

83
00:04:33,893 --> 00:04:35,310
Well, Rachel e-mailed me.
She said she's not really sure

84
00:04:35,361 --> 00:04:37,478
what she's doing
for the holidays yet.

85
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:39,614
I'm sorry about what went down
with the two of you.

86
00:04:39,648 --> 00:04:42,450
No, it's cool.
It's for the best.

87
00:04:42,484 --> 00:04:43,484
Well, I think that it's sweet

88
00:04:43,535 --> 00:04:45,987
that you and Rachel
keep in touch, Quinn.

89
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:47,622
Well, she basically e-mails me
every other week

90
00:04:47,656 --> 00:04:49,290
to remind me that I still
haven't used

91
00:04:49,325 --> 00:04:50,708
the train ticket
that she gave me.

92
00:04:50,743 --> 00:04:52,627
I'm just, I'm trying
to keep straight A's.

93
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:53,795
And I just got tapped to be in

94
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:56,331
the only female secret society
at Yale.

95
00:04:56,382 --> 00:04:59,000
Former members: Hillary Clinton,
Jennifer Beals.

96
00:04:59,051 --> 00:05:02,337
You go, girl.
(all chuckle)

97
00:05:02,388 --> 00:05:03,638
Well, I, for one, would love

98
00:05:03,672 --> 00:05:05,590
to talk about everybody
that <i>is</i> here.

99
00:05:05,624 --> 00:05:07,809
I have a favor to ask.

100
00:05:07,843 --> 00:05:09,310
(bell ringing)

101
00:05:09,345 --> 00:05:13,147
All right, do you realize,
standing before you are legends?

102
00:05:13,182 --> 00:05:15,483
(cheers and applause)

103
00:05:15,517 --> 00:05:17,602
Any single one of these guys
could be.

104
00:05:17,636 --> 00:05:19,687
President of the United States
one day.

105
00:05:19,738 --> 00:05:21,689
I don't know about that.
And lucky for us,

106
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,191
they've agreed to help us...

107
00:05:23,242 --> 00:05:25,360
Hang with the new chumps
and see if some of

108
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:27,578
our sheer awesomeness
doesn't rub off on you.

109
00:05:27,613 --> 00:05:29,347
It will.

110
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:31,082
When you hear your name,
pair up.

111
00:05:31,116 --> 00:05:32,316
Puck, you're with your brother.

112
00:05:34,486 --> 00:05:36,754
Mike, you're with Ryder.

113
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:39,607
Marley, you're with Santana.

114
00:05:39,642 --> 00:05:41,009
Kitty, you're with Quinn.

115
00:05:41,043 --> 00:05:43,177
Oh!
Wade, Mercedes.

116
00:05:43,212 --> 00:05:45,430
Sashay.
<i>Enchanté.</i>

117
00:05:45,464 --> 00:05:47,215
I knew it.
Mercedes was cloned.

118
00:05:47,266 --> 00:05:51,135
Now, your mentors are here to
help you with whatever you need:

119
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:52,353
Singing, dancing...

120
00:05:52,388 --> 00:05:53,471
Birth control.

121
00:05:53,505 --> 00:05:55,857
You're so funny and
self-deprecating!

122
00:05:55,891 --> 00:05:57,392
We're so much alike!

123
00:05:57,443 --> 00:05:58,476
Wanky.

124
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,944
The worst mistake
that we can make

125
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:01,129
is to underestimate
our competition.

126
00:06:01,163 --> 00:06:02,947
The Warblers are ruthless
this year.

127
00:06:02,982 --> 00:06:04,615
Don't forget about
the Rosedale Mennonites.

128
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,368
Any show choir that can
raise a barn in five minutes

129
00:06:07,403 --> 00:06:08,953
deserves mad respect.

130
00:06:08,988 --> 00:06:11,406
Marley and Blaine will handle
our duet,

131
00:06:11,457 --> 00:06:15,126
and for the showstopper
we're doing "Gangnam Style."

132
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,577
Okay, lumps,
let me just say out loud

133
00:06:16,628 --> 00:06:18,079
what everyone here is thinking:

134
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,548
You finally got an okay haircut,
you're not doing

135
00:06:20,582 --> 00:06:23,801
that annoying half smirk
as much as you used to,

136
00:06:23,836 --> 00:06:26,220
but you're still a idiot.
No one in this room

137
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:28,923
can tackle a massive dance
number except for Brit.

138
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:30,925
That includes your little
"Hand-Jive"

139
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:33,061
that, to me, looked more
like a hand...

140
00:06:33,095 --> 00:06:35,179
Is there any way Mr. Shue
can come back for this?

141
00:06:35,213 --> 00:06:38,149
Listen to me, we have never lost
sectionals before,

142
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:40,651
and there's no way we're
gonna do it under my watch.

143
00:06:40,686 --> 00:06:43,154
We can and we will succeed!

144
00:06:43,188 --> 00:06:46,657
We need an ambitious number
with a strong dance element.

145
00:06:46,692 --> 00:06:48,910
That's the Warbler's calling
card, and we need to blow them

146
00:06:48,944 --> 00:06:50,862
out of the water. And Mike said
he could easily show

147
00:06:50,896 --> 00:06:53,031
one of our guys how to do
the dance number. I did?

148
00:06:53,065 --> 00:06:56,117
Crap. I, uh, I kind of forgot
to ask you about that.

149
00:06:56,168 --> 00:06:58,086
But one of our guys
is gonna have

150
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,422
to take the lead with Brit.
So who's it gonna be?

151
00:07:01,457 --> 00:07:02,874
Hello? White Chocolate.

152
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:05,009
(beatboxing)

153
00:07:05,044 --> 00:07:08,513
MERCEDES:
Oh, no, no, no. Um...

154
00:07:08,547 --> 00:07:09,714
(bell ringing)

155
00:07:09,748 --> 00:07:11,599
Hey, I can't believe
that we have to dance

156
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:12,850
for this guy who's
getting trained

157
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:14,018
at the Joffrey Ballet School.

158
00:07:14,053 --> 00:07:15,303
He's gonna think
I'm special needs.

159
00:07:15,354 --> 00:07:16,637
Listen, man, I need to talk

160
00:07:16,688 --> 00:07:17,805
to you about something else.

161
00:07:17,856 --> 00:07:20,892
Last Friday...

162
00:07:20,926 --> 00:07:22,777
I kind of went out with Marley.

163
00:07:22,811 --> 00:07:24,145
Kind of?

164
00:07:24,196 --> 00:07:25,897
I mean, we didn't
actually go anywhere.

165
00:07:25,931 --> 00:07:28,316
We just kind of hung out
and played SongPop

166
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:29,317
and Bad Piggies all night.

167
00:07:29,368 --> 00:07:31,369
So this is like a thing?

168
00:07:31,403 --> 00:07:33,905
Not if it's gonna make us
mortal enemies again.

169
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:36,791
I'll end it if you want me to,
but for the record,

170
00:07:36,825 --> 00:07:39,660
I wasn't just gonna
hump her and dump her.

171
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:42,230
Marley's different,
she's special.

172
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:47,251
No, don't break it off
because of me.

173
00:07:49,171 --> 00:07:50,388
Yeah?

174
00:07:50,422 --> 00:07:52,090
Yeah, but you better not snake

175
00:07:52,124 --> 00:07:54,308
the dance lead from me,
all right?

176
00:07:54,343 --> 00:07:57,011
You don't get to have
everything at this school.

177
00:07:57,062 --> 00:07:58,396
That's all yours, dude.

178
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,682
I don't have any end
zone moves anyway.

179
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:04,602
RACHEL: So I found out that I
didn't get cast in <i>Glass Menagerie,</i>

180
00:08:04,636 --> 00:08:06,687
KURT: Oh! But the NYADA
Showcase is this week,

181
00:08:06,738 --> 00:08:08,689
so I'm gonna spend the whole,
long holiday weekend

182
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,409
just really prepping for it to
make sure that I get it. Good.

183
00:08:11,443 --> 00:08:12,860
Did you put in
your application?

184
00:08:12,911 --> 00:08:15,696
Yes, and I put it on Vogue.com
stationery so it'd stand out.

185
00:08:15,747 --> 00:08:17,415
I'm really feeling good
about us staying home

186
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:18,616
for the weekend, don't you?

187
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,201
Yeah, yeah. Yeah-yeah-
yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah.

188
00:08:20,252 --> 00:08:22,870
We don't have to go home
just because there's a show

189
00:08:22,921 --> 00:08:24,622
or because it's
a long weekend, right?

190
00:08:24,656 --> 00:08:25,873
Right, no.
I mean,

191
00:08:25,924 --> 00:08:26,958
even though it's Thanksgiving,

192
00:08:26,992 --> 00:08:29,794
and sectionals, and
all our friends are there,

193
00:08:29,828 --> 00:08:31,212
and I miss my dad.

194
00:08:31,263 --> 00:08:34,465
I miss my dads, too,
but I just feel like every time

195
00:08:34,499 --> 00:08:36,384
we go home,
it just makes me feel sad

196
00:08:36,435 --> 00:08:38,102
and like we're not like
moving forward, you know?

197
00:08:38,137 --> 00:08:39,854
And even though we don't have
our boyfriends,

198
00:08:39,888 --> 00:08:41,472
we still have our dreams
and our ambition.

199
00:08:41,506 --> 00:08:42,557
And each other.

200
00:08:42,608 --> 00:08:44,559
Yes. You are the only
significant other I need

201
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,710
in my life.
Oh...

202
00:08:45,744 --> 00:08:47,445
I have to just, you know,
forget about Finn

203
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:48,696
and forget about Brody.

204
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,314
Forget about Blaine.

205
00:08:50,348 --> 00:08:53,034
Yeah, forget any guy who's broke
an girl or guy's heart, okay?

206
00:08:53,068 --> 00:08:54,702
We are on the verge of becoming

207
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:56,737
the best versions of ourselves.
Can't you feel it?

208
00:08:56,788 --> 00:08:58,072
For the first time,
probably because

209
00:08:58,123 --> 00:08:59,574
it's easier just
to drink your Kool-Aid,

210
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:02,243
than go against you.
I know what you mean.

211
00:09:02,294 --> 00:09:03,995
Look. Look at our life.

212
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:05,463
Look at this city!
Yeah.

213
00:09:05,497 --> 00:09:08,216
I know that it can be a little
sad and lonely sometimes,

214
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,884
but I promise you,

215
00:09:09,918 --> 00:09:14,088
we are gonna have the
best Thanksgiving ever.

216
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:15,640
Pinkie promise?

217
00:09:15,674 --> 00:09:17,425

Okay, fellas,

Korean boy bands have
been tearing up the music scene,

221
00:09:29,923 --> 00:09:31,924

we can learn from them.

222

Santana, Brittany and I
knew each other so well

we were gonna move.

She's sweet as pie,

338
00:13:52,185 --> 00:13:53,853
and I've tried to be
a good friend to her,

339
00:13:53,887 --> 00:13:56,022
but ever since she started
dating Jake Puckerman,

340
00:13:56,056 --> 00:13:57,807
I fear she's on the wrong path.

341
00:13:57,858 --> 00:14:01,143
Word is he's pressuring her
to swipe her V-card.

343
00:14:02,362 --> 00:14:04,313

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,707
You told me that you love it.

349
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:16,208
You take lessons.

350
00:14:16,243 --> 00:14:18,327
It's kind of an honor amongst
bro thing with Ryder.

351
00:14:18,378 --> 00:14:20,129
Look, he's being really cool
about you and me,

352
00:14:20,163 --> 00:14:21,297
and he wants the solo,

353
00:14:21,331 --> 00:14:23,165
so I'm just trying
to do him a solid.

354
00:14:23,216 --> 00:14:24,917
Even if that means
we lose sectionals?

355
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:26,585
(sighs)

356
00:14:26,619 --> 00:14:27,837
Ryder's gonna be great.

357
00:14:27,888 --> 00:14:29,505
I promise.

358
00:14:29,556 --> 00:14:30,673
I will make sure he's great.

359
00:14:30,724 --> 00:14:32,141
Now can I walk you
to lunch please?

360
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:33,509
You've been skipping out
on me all week.

361
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,760
Can't. I have to rehearse.

362
00:14:34,794 --> 00:14:37,263
Because I'm not gonna be the one

363
00:14:37,297 --> 00:14:39,065
who lets the team down.

364
00:14:41,134 --> 00:14:42,935
(bell ringing)

365
00:14:44,404 --> 00:14:45,688
Uh, guys, listen up.

366
00:14:45,739 --> 00:14:47,940
Ms. July said that
she does not want to teach today

367
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:50,192
because she can't stand
to be in the same room

368
00:14:50,243 --> 00:14:52,278
as your mediocrity again.

369
00:14:52,312 --> 00:14:54,530
If you ask me,
she just sounds super hung over.

370
00:14:54,581 --> 00:14:56,949
Either way, I will be
teaching Dance 101 today.

371
00:15:02,422 --> 00:15:03,756
Is there a problem?

372
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,125
Well, you know, everyone here
pays like, $30,000 a year

373
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:08,127
to be taught by a professional
and not a T.A.

374
00:15:08,161 --> 00:15:10,379
I'm sorry, are you angry at me
about something?

375
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,182
You mean, besides the fact
that you slept with Cassie?

376
00:15:13,216 --> 00:15:15,017
And why do you care
who I sleep with?

377
00:15:15,051 --> 00:15:16,569
Do I really need to answer that?

378
00:15:16,603 --> 00:15:18,354
Hey, I'm the one
who came on to you,

379
00:15:18,388 --> 00:15:20,222
remember? You broke
off our date

380
00:15:20,273 --> 00:15:22,374
to see another guy.
Yeah, well, that's over now.

381
00:15:22,409 --> 00:15:24,527
And what, so I'm supposed
to have retroactively known

382
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:26,979
that that was gonna happen
and not slept with Cassie?

383
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:28,647
All right, guys,

384
00:15:28,681 --> 00:15:31,400
let's, uh, let's pair up and
start with a basic fox-trot.

385
00:15:31,451 --> 00:15:33,452
(music begins)

386
00:15:35,622 --> 00:15:37,406
We're not in high
school anymore, okay?

387
00:15:37,457 --> 00:15:39,325
We're adults

388
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:40,993
making adult choices.

389
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:42,578
You made yourself unavailable.

390
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:44,497
Don't be that crazy girl

391
00:15:44,531 --> 00:15:46,081
who expects people
to read her mind.

392
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:49,001
Well, I'm sorry, but you don't
have to be a mind reader to know

393
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:50,219
that she is my mortal enemy.

394
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:52,004
Did it at least suck?
Are you kidding?

395
00:15:52,038 --> 00:15:54,089
It was amazing. Have
you seen her ass?

396
00:15:54,141 --> 00:15:57,426
Look, but I know
that we're friends

397
00:15:57,477 --> 00:16:00,596
and I don't want
to hurt you, so...

398
00:16:00,647 --> 00:16:02,881
it won't happen again, okay?

399
00:16:04,434 --> 00:16:06,435
Okay.

400
00:16:06,486 --> 00:16:07,937
What are you doing
for Thanksgiving?

401
00:16:07,988 --> 00:16:09,605
Going back to Ohio?

402
00:16:09,656 --> 00:16:10,940
No, Kurt and I are doing

403
00:16:10,991 --> 00:16:14,109
our little private
orphan Thanksgiving here.

404
00:16:14,161 --> 00:16:15,861
Wow, that sounds awful
and depressing,

405
00:16:15,895 --> 00:16:17,613
especially since I've tasted
your cooking.

406
00:16:17,664 --> 00:16:19,114
(chuckles)
All right, guys, come on.

407
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,583
Let's take it from the top.

408
00:16:20,617 --> 00:16:23,369
And this time,
can we actually try?

409
00:16:25,121 --> 00:16:27,173
So I can't afford
to go home this year.

410
00:16:27,207 --> 00:16:30,876
How about I come over
and cook for you guys?

411
00:16:32,912 --> 00:16:35,297
Yeah, that would be great.

412
00:16:35,348 --> 00:16:36,799
Do you mind if I bring Cassie?
Oh, shut up.

413
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,601
Just dance with me.
Okay.

414
00:16:38,635 --> 00:16:41,303
PUCK: That's a real solid you're
doing for that Ryder dude.

415
00:16:41,354 --> 00:16:43,556
"Bros before hos" was always
my mantra in high school.

416
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:46,475
Well, it was after I knocked up
my best friend's girlfriend.

417
00:16:46,526 --> 00:16:48,310
Oh, speak of the devil
I knocked up.

418
00:16:48,361 --> 00:16:49,478
Back off of Marley.

419
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:50,613
Excuse me?

420
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:51,647
I got this, little bro.

421
00:16:51,698 --> 00:16:53,148
See that furrowed brow,
lips pursed,

422
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,650
hand on her hip,
this is what I like

423
00:16:54,701 --> 00:16:55,784
to call "Loopy Quinn."

424
00:16:55,819 --> 00:16:56,952
It's an irrational state

425
00:16:56,987 --> 00:16:58,737
that she apparently only
reserves for Puckermans.

426
00:16:58,771 --> 00:17:00,322
He's messing with her head.

427
00:17:00,373 --> 00:17:01,657
He's pressuring her
to have sex th him.

428
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,459
Who told you that?
I don't need somebody to tell me

429
00:17:03,493 --> 00:17:05,160
that the biggest womanizer
in school

430
00:17:05,212 --> 00:17:07,046
is trying to take advantage
of the naive girl

431
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,998
who just wants to
fit in and be loved,

432
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:11,417
especially if the womanizer's
last name is Puckerman.

433
00:17:11,451 --> 00:17:13,219
You don't know me.
I'm a lot of thing he's not,

434
00:17:13,253 --> 00:17:14,503
and I would never do that
to Marley.

435
00:17:14,554 --> 00:17:16,505
I don't believe you.

436
00:17:16,556 --> 00:17:19,508
Quinn, I think you're being
a little out of line here.

437
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:22,311
The only way
you're gonna win sectionals

438
00:17:22,345 --> 00:17:24,230
is if Marley's at her best.

439
00:17:24,264 --> 00:17:25,681
And if you keep distracting her,

440
00:17:25,732 --> 00:17:27,966
she's not going to be.

441
00:17:36,641 --> 00:17:39,744
Hey.
Oh!

442
00:17:39,778 --> 00:17:41,362
Oh, Isabelle, I am so sorry.

443
00:17:41,413 --> 00:17:42,663
I thought I was
the last one here.

444
00:17:42,697 --> 00:17:43,998
Its okay. Actually,
I'm almost done.

445
00:17:44,032 --> 00:17:46,167
I'm just, um, proofing
the filmmaker roundtable.

446
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:47,818
Oh, I love that article.

447
00:17:47,852 --> 00:17:49,236
Oh, good.
I love Christmas movies.

448
00:17:49,287 --> 00:17:50,871
Be honest, which one

449
00:17:50,906 --> 00:17:52,156
are you looking forward to
the most,

450
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,574
<i>Les Miz</i> or <i>The Hobbit?</i>

451
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,326
Oh, wow.

452
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,660
I love Peter Jackson,

453
00:17:56,694 --> 00:17:59,330
but I'm obsessed
with the French Revolution,

454
00:17:59,364 --> 00:18:01,749
so, uh, I suppose it would have

455
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,752
to be... a double feature.
A double feature?

456
00:18:04,803 --> 00:18:06,504
(chuckles)

457
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:09,757
So, uh, do you have any
fantabulous Thanksgiving plans?

458
00:18:09,808 --> 00:18:11,759
For the last five years,
I always went to Gore Vidal's

459
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,427
for dinner and Pictionary.

460
00:18:13,478 --> 00:18:16,263
But you know,
Gore passed away this year,

461
00:18:16,314 --> 00:18:17,731
so I don't know.

462
00:18:17,766 --> 00:18:19,266
I'll probably just get
some turkey pizza

463
00:18:19,317 --> 00:18:20,901
from Two Boots and, uh,

464
00:18:20,936 --> 00:18:22,269
recreate my first Thanksgiving

465
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,437
in New York.

466
00:18:23,488 --> 00:18:25,739
Well, if you're interested,

467
00:18:25,774 --> 00:18:28,342
my roommate and I are hosting
a bit of an orphan's dinner

468
00:18:28,376 --> 00:18:29,527
out in Bushwick.

469
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:31,195
Bushwick? Ooh.

470
00:18:31,229 --> 00:18:33,113
A rustic Thanksgiving.

471
00:18:33,165 --> 00:18:34,532
(chuckles)

472
00:18:34,566 --> 00:18:35,866
Can I bring some friends?
Of course.

473
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,618
We'll have as many orphans

474
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:39,420
as Mr. Bumble's workhouse,
right?

475
00:18:39,454 --> 00:18:41,121
Gruel for everyone.

476
00:18:41,173 --> 00:18:43,207
You seem in a better mood.

477
00:18:43,241 --> 00:18:44,291
You and your ex

478
00:18:44,342 --> 00:18:45,459
have a <i>rapprochement?</i>

479
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,127
<i>Au contraire.</i>

480
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:48,295
No, I'm closing the book

481
00:18:48,346 --> 00:18:50,464
to that sad saga.
I'm just...

482
00:18:50,515 --> 00:18:51,966
I'm done.
I'm done thinking about it.

483
00:18:52,017 --> 00:18:54,218
I'm done thinking if we're
gonna get back together,

484
00:18:54,252 --> 00:18:56,604
wondering if we should
get back together.

485
00:18:56,638 --> 00:18:57,972
No, it's over.

486
00:18:58,023 --> 00:18:59,690
I sent him a text.

487
00:18:59,724 --> 00:19:02,476
Said, "Please, stop calling me
to say you're sorry."

488
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,777
What's done is done."

489
00:19:03,812 --> 00:19:05,062
You know.
Well, listen,

490
00:19:05,096 --> 00:19:08,482
nothing is better than being
single in New York City,

491
00:19:08,517 --> 00:19:11,068
but you know, if he's
been reaching out to you...

492
00:19:11,102 --> 00:19:12,319
Assuage his guilt?

493
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,654
No, sorry, cheater.

494
00:19:13,705 --> 00:19:14,989
This petal needs to move on.

495
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,790
In my experience,

496
00:19:16,825 --> 00:19:18,826
it's always easier
for me to move on

497
00:19:18,877 --> 00:19:20,794
if I've either
had my apology accepted,

498
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:26,000
or in your case,
accepted an apology.

499
00:19:26,051 --> 00:19:27,635
You know,

500
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:30,471
sometimes it's the not forgiving
that holds us back.

501
00:19:30,505 --> 00:19:32,339
(sighs)

502
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,008
(bell rings)

503
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:35,175
QUINN:
Try to make eye contact

504
00:19:35,227 --> 00:19:37,478
with the judges,
and don't be afraid

505
00:19:37,512 --> 00:19:38,596
to give them
a flirty little smile

506
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,980
or maybe even a wink.

507
00:19:40,015 --> 00:19:41,682
You're really doing them
a favor.

508
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:43,267
You're reminding them
of their youth

509
00:19:43,301 --> 00:19:44,685
and what might have been.

510
00:19:44,736 --> 00:19:45,853
I'm gonna write that down.

511
00:19:45,904 --> 00:19:48,305
You're the best mentor ever.

512
00:19:49,741 --> 00:19:51,859
Seriously, the best.

513
00:19:53,194 --> 00:19:54,478
<i>Hola.</i>

514
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,698
That bitch is pure evil.

515
00:19:57,749 --> 00:19:59,533
I think she's sweet.
Really?

516
00:19:59,584 --> 00:20:01,535
Well, then why is she giving
my girl laxatives?

517
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:03,037
Why are you going
through my bag?

518
00:20:03,088 --> 00:20:04,505
It's all part
of being a mentor.

519
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:06,206
What is this, huh?

520
00:20:06,258 --> 00:20:07,541
And don't tell me

521
00:20:07,592 --> 00:20:09,793
it's 'cause the cafeteria food
binds you up.

522
00:20:09,827 --> 00:20:11,211
Those are like, from months ago.

523
00:20:11,263 --> 00:20:12,880
I forgot
they were even in there.

524
00:20:12,931 --> 00:20:14,381
Your pretty little liar
gave them to her.

525
00:20:14,432 --> 00:20:17,017
I can sense it thanks to my
psychic Mexican third eye.

526
00:20:17,052 --> 00:20:19,853
See, this is what my psych
professor calls projecting.

527
00:20:19,888 --> 00:20:22,056
You're projecting Kitty
onto me.

528
00:20:22,107 --> 00:20:24,191
Santana, we've graduated.
It's really time

529
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:25,559
to get over this.
Get over what?

530
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,144
You being jealous of me.

531
00:20:27,178 --> 00:20:30,147
And why would I
be jealous of you?

532
00:20:30,181 --> 00:20:31,532
And please don't tell me

533
00:20:31,566 --> 00:20:34,068
its because you're in some lame
secret Nazi sorority.

534
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,619
Look, Homecoming weekend,

535
00:20:35,654 --> 00:20:37,321
I went
to Jodie Foster's clambake,

536
00:20:37,355 --> 00:20:38,405
and that professor

537
00:20:38,456 --> 00:20:39,740
that I was talking about,

538
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,575
well, he's 35,

539
00:20:41,626 --> 00:20:43,243
smokes a pipe.

540
00:20:43,295 --> 00:20:44,878
Well, he's divorcing his wife

541
00:20:44,913 --> 00:20:47,331
who hasn't touched him
for three years.

542
00:20:47,365 --> 00:20:48,716
I'm dating him.

543
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,084
Wow, Twitter update!

544
00:20:50,135 --> 00:20:51,585
Quinn is

545
00:20:51,636 --> 00:20:54,755
all excited about another guy
defining her life.

546
00:20:54,806 --> 00:20:56,173
And what are you excited about?

547
00:20:56,207 --> 00:20:57,725
Shaking pom-poms in Kentucky?

548
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:59,893
I mean, you want everybody to
think that you're such a badass,

549
00:20:59,928 --> 00:21:01,878
but really you're just
a scared little girl

550
00:21:01,896 --> 00:21:03,314
with low self-esteem

551
00:21:03,348 --> 00:21:05,566
who's too frightened
to chase her dreams.

552
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,101
Did Professor Patches
teach you that one

553
00:21:07,152 --> 00:21:09,403
in between quickies
on his office couch?

554
00:21:09,437 --> 00:21:11,388
Does he get so turned on

555
00:21:11,406 --> 00:21:13,824
by teen moms who barely
visit their kid?

556
00:21:13,858 --> 00:21:15,025
(gasps)

557
00:21:15,777 --> 00:21:16,994
What are you guys doing?

558
00:21:18,997 --> 00:21:20,998
Nothing.

559
00:21:24,953 --> 00:21:26,337
Quinn always was
a genius slapper.

560
00:21:26,371 --> 00:21:27,738

562
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,509
(muttering lyrics)

563
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,801
Are you dancing

564
00:21:40,852 --> 00:21:42,686
or impersonating
a horny epileptic?

565
00:21:42,721 --> 00:21:44,438
Dude, I can't concentrate
on the moves

566
00:21:44,472 --> 00:21:46,423
until I memorize the words.

567
00:21:46,441 --> 00:21:48,442

570
00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:56,099
I mean, seriously?

571
00:21:56,117 --> 00:21:57,434
Dude, it's Korean.

572
00:21:57,452 --> 00:21:58,902
Just sing gibberish. Who cares?

573
00:21:58,936 --> 00:22:00,120
And if you're concentrating

574
00:22:00,155 --> 00:22:01,772
on the dance moves,
you're doing it wrong.

575
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,907
(sighs) Well, that's how
I work through everything.

576
00:22:03,941 --> 00:22:05,909
I learn the basics, practice
them over and over again,

577
00:22:05,943 --> 00:22:07,077
and eventually I get it.

578
00:22:07,111 --> 00:22:08,612
So, did you do an apple pie

579
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,280
500 times before you had sex?

580
00:22:10,298 --> 00:22:12,115
(laughs)

581
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:14,635
It's exactly what I did,
but I wore a condom

582
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:16,253
so I didn't make
any apple fritters.

583
00:22:16,287 --> 00:22:17,621
(laughs) Look.

584
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:20,624
Some things you can't
overthink, okay?

585
00:22:20,642 --> 00:22:22,292
You just got to let
it come natural.

586
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,927
"Gangnam Style" isn't
about technique.

587
00:22:23,961 --> 00:22:25,962
It's about just
letting yourself go.

588
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,631
Okay?

I thought you said
you didn't have any moves.

593
00:22:37,975 --> 00:22:39,810
(music stops) You asked
me not to take everything

594
00:22:39,828 --> 00:22:41,111
from you and I respect that.

595
00:22:41,145 --> 00:22:43,113
Plus, it's kind of embarrassing

596
00:22:43,147 --> 00:22:44,147
that I'm trained in ballet.

597
00:22:44,165 --> 00:22:46,417

598
00:22:47,485 --> 00:22:48,702

Dude, you're obviously
better than me.

you should do it.

603
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,127
How about

604
00:22:57,161 --> 00:22:58,829
I just help you get better?

605
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:01,965
Okay.

606
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:03,634
But if at any point
you want to bail,

607
00:23:03,668 --> 00:23:06,670
or get food,
or go get me food...

608
00:23:06,688 --> 00:23:09,523
Let's start by watching
this video one more time.

609
00:23:09,557 --> 00:23:13,644
Maybe we'll be
viewer 500 million.

611
00:23:15,563 --> 00:23:17,064
There he goes.

612
00:23:21,752 --> 00:23:23,920
A bag?

613
00:23:23,954 --> 00:23:25,922
Yeah, I'm telling you, you put it
in the bag and it self-bastes.

614
00:23:25,956 --> 00:23:27,256
Tommy the turkey

615
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,492
is not gonna go dry.

616
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,210
Ina Garten would never cook
a turkey in a bag.

617
00:23:31,261 --> 00:23:33,096
Well, when Ina comes to cook
you Thanksgiving dinner,

618
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,764
she can do as she pleases.

619
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:35,998
But our bird

620
00:23:36,016 --> 00:23:37,717
is getting bagged.
Mmm.

621
00:23:37,768 --> 00:23:38,885
Guys, this is so great.

622
00:23:38,936 --> 00:23:40,603
Yeah, it's like
our own <i>Big Chill.</i>

623
00:23:40,637 --> 00:23:43,389
Yeah, but no one breaks
out into song. What?

624
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,774
Now, Rachel, get over here

625
00:23:44,808 --> 00:23:46,008
and help me butter up Tommy.

626
00:23:46,026 --> 00:23:47,443
Okay, well, I'm a vegetarian

627
00:23:47,478 --> 00:23:49,896
so I can't eat it but
I guess I can touch it.

628
00:23:49,947 --> 00:23:52,515
Yeah. Okay, Mr. Tur...
I'm very sorry.

629
00:23:52,533 --> 00:23:53,516
Like that?

630
00:23:53,534 --> 00:23:55,401
You got to get it in there.

631
00:23:55,452 --> 00:23:57,520
Really show him
that you love him.

632
00:23:57,538 --> 00:23:59,622
You know?
Just like that.

633
00:23:59,656 --> 00:24:02,375
Is that good?
Yeah, like that.

634
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,129
When you two are done
using that turkey

635
00:24:06,163 --> 00:24:08,131
as a courtship device,
would you put it in the oven?

636
00:24:08,165 --> 00:24:09,749
'Cause it's almost 5:00.

637
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,251
Oh, my God, it's almost time
for sectionals to start.

638
00:24:12,302 --> 00:24:13,469
Why are they having it
on Thanksgiving anyway?

639
00:24:13,504 --> 00:24:14,754
I'm sure they figured
with everyone

640
00:24:14,805 --> 00:24:16,372
home for the holiday,
they would sell more tickets.

641
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,591
Most high schools have football
games for Thanksgiving.

642
00:24:18,642 --> 00:24:19,842
I remember my first sectionals.

643
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:21,310
I was so nervous.

644
00:24:21,345 --> 00:24:23,262
I gave myself this pep
talk in the mirror,

645
00:24:23,313 --> 00:24:26,983
and I just began my soulful
monologue by saying...

646
00:24:27,017 --> 00:24:28,651
MARLEY:
<i>You are ready for this.</i>

647
00:24:28,685 --> 00:24:31,654
<i>You look really good,</i>
<i>your voice is strong.</i>

648
00:24:31,688 --> 00:24:36,225
<i>It's time to make a little</i>
<i>girl's dream come true.</i>

649
00:24:36,243 --> 00:24:39,662
<i>I'm so hungry...</i>
<i>but at least</i>

650
00:24:39,696 --> 00:24:42,365
<i>my dress fits.</i>

651
00:24:47,838 --> 00:24:49,738
Wade... I mean,
Unique, you're back!

652
00:24:49,757 --> 00:24:52,842
Yes, in all her glory.

653
00:24:52,876 --> 00:24:55,511
And as you can see, Miss Marley,
she is ready for her close-up.

654
00:24:55,546 --> 00:24:57,346
I thought your parents didn't
want you wearing...

655
00:24:57,381 --> 00:24:58,631
They don't.

656
00:24:58,682 --> 00:25:00,016
They're trying to protect me.

657
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,300
But what they need to understand

658
00:25:01,351 --> 00:25:03,186
is if I'm not being
true to myself at least

659
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,188
when I'm performing,
then there won't be

660
00:25:05,222 --> 00:25:07,590
anything left inside
me to protect.

661
00:25:07,608 --> 00:25:09,809
So they can keep talking
about sending me to a camp

662
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,644
for little boys who
like to wear dresses,

663
00:25:11,695 --> 00:25:14,597
but I will not and I cannot
be ashamed of who I am

664
00:25:14,615 --> 00:25:16,098
or how I look.

665
00:25:16,116 --> 00:25:17,366
You look beautiful.

666
00:25:17,401 --> 00:25:19,101
I think it's inspiring

667
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,903
how brave and proud you are.

668
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:22,321
I wish I was more like that.

669
00:25:22,372 --> 00:25:23,873
Stop.

670
00:25:23,907 --> 00:25:25,158
Hustle up, you two.

671
00:25:25,209 --> 00:25:26,659
You're gonna miss show circle.

672
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,944
And welcome back, girl.

673
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:30,613
What's show circle?
Come on.

674
00:25:30,631 --> 00:25:32,548
It's a tradition
before every competition.

675
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:33,916
It's something Mr. Shue made up.

676
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,885
And today I want to add to it.

677
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,387
Joe, how about
you lead us in prayer?

678
00:25:38,422 --> 00:25:39,455
PUCK:
Whoa, dude, Old Testament.

679
00:25:39,473 --> 00:25:41,057
There's Hebrews here.
Yeah, okay.

680
00:25:41,091 --> 00:25:43,509
This is one of my favorite
Bible verses from Isaiah.

681
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,228
Considering that the
Warblers are so good,

682
00:25:45,262 --> 00:25:47,513
and that it's the first
competition for a lot of you,

683
00:25:47,564 --> 00:25:48,731
I think it's appropriate.

684
00:25:48,765 --> 00:25:52,518
"So do not fear
because I am with you.

685
00:25:52,569 --> 00:25:53,686
"Do not be dismayed.

686
00:25:53,737 --> 00:25:55,855
"I will strengthen you,

687
00:25:55,906 --> 00:25:57,857
I will uphold you
with my righteous hand."

688
00:25:57,908 --> 00:26:00,409
And our righteous dance moves, amen.
All right!

689
00:26:00,444 --> 00:26:03,196
(indistinct chatter, applause)

690
00:26:03,247 --> 00:26:05,748
Ugh! Man, I-I remember
our first sectionals

691
00:26:05,782 --> 00:26:07,366
like it was yesterday.

692
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:10,419
We came together as a
team because we had to.

693
00:26:10,454 --> 00:26:12,705
Because no one
outside our circle

694
00:26:12,756 --> 00:26:14,257
knew how much we'd been through,

695
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:17,293
and how much
it meant to us to win it.

696
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:18,994
This is our house.

697
00:26:19,012 --> 00:26:22,331

00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,011
Ooh, she's been a bitch tonight.

863
00:32:48,062 --> 00:32:49,429
(car horn honking)

864
00:32:49,463 --> 00:32:51,231
And by bitch, I mean this rain.

865
00:32:51,266 --> 00:32:53,484
No cabs nowhere.

866
00:32:53,518 --> 00:32:57,988
So I had to put on the wig
and the heels and the lashes

867
00:32:58,022 --> 00:33:00,824
and the ear, and take a train

868
00:33:00,859 --> 00:33:02,609
to the club.

869
00:33:02,643 --> 00:33:03,944
So I hope you're up, girl,

870
00:33:03,978 --> 00:33:05,863
'cause we are all coming over.

871
00:33:05,914 --> 00:33:08,365
Lock the door, lower the blinds,

872
00:33:08,416 --> 00:33:10,701
light up the smoke machine,
and put on your heels,

873
00:33:10,752 --> 00:33:13,036
'cause I know
exactly what we need.

Hello?

971
00:36:51,923 --> 00:36:53,590
Hey.

972
00:36:53,641 --> 00:36:55,675
Can you hear me?
It's kind of loud out here.

Uh, no, not yet.

976
00:37:04,102 --> 00:37:06,069
Kurt, I just want you
to know that

977
00:37:06,104 --> 00:37:07,521
no matter...

978
00:37:07,555 --> 00:37:09,172
Just let me talk for a second.

979
00:37:09,207 --> 00:37:13,577
Look, you've... you've said
you're sorry a million times.

980
00:37:13,611 --> 00:37:15,412
And...

981
00:37:15,446 --> 00:37:16,947
I believe you.

982
00:37:16,998 --> 00:37:20,367
And I'm trying
to forgive you, but...

983
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:23,453
...I'm just not there yet.

984
00:37:23,504 --> 00:37:26,523
But...

985
00:37:26,557 --> 00:37:30,427
it's Thanksgiving,
and it's sectionals, and...

986
00:37:30,461 --> 00:37:31,878
I miss you like crazy.

987
00:37:31,912 --> 00:37:35,999
And... I can't stand
not talking to you,

988
00:37:36,033 --> 00:37:38,034
even though I'm mad at you.

989
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:40,370
'Cause you're still
my best friend.

990
00:37:41,422 --> 00:37:42,989
You're mine, too.

991
00:37:48,196 --> 00:37:51,148
At Christmas, we... we need to
have a mature heart-to-heart.

992
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:53,033
And maybe if it's cold enough,

993
00:37:53,067 --> 00:37:54,618
we can go ice skating
on the Auglaize River,

994
00:37:54,652 --> 00:37:55,952
and get hot chocolate

995
00:37:55,987 --> 00:37:57,287
anywhere but the Lima Bean,

996
00:37:57,321 --> 00:37:58,955
because when I was
working there I saw a mouse.

997
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,740
(laughs)

998
00:38:00,774 --> 00:38:03,477
So, uh, we're really gonna
see each other at Christmas?

999
00:38:03,511 --> 00:38:05,445
Yeah.

1000
00:38:11,285 --> 00:38:13,587
Well, don't let any of those
hideous Warblers win.

1001
00:38:13,621 --> 00:38:15,422
All right?

1002
00:38:15,456 --> 00:38:16,640
Break a leg.

1003
00:38:16,674 --> 00:38:18,675

00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:32,337
You okay?

1011
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:33,621
Yeah.

1012
00:39:33,672 --> 00:39:35,673
You don't look okay.

1013
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,427
Okay, fine, I'm not okay.

1014
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:41,463
Look, look...

1015
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:44,632
It's just nerves.

1016
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:45,717
It's a good thing.
You can use it.

1017
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:47,769
I don't know how
it's a good thing

1018
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:49,104
when I haven't slept in days,

1019
00:39:49,138 --> 00:39:51,055
and I'm sweating

1020
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:52,774
when it's not even hot,

1021
00:39:52,808 --> 00:39:54,943
and I feel like
if we don't win,

1022
00:39:54,977 --> 00:39:56,728
it's going to be all my fault.

1023
00:39:56,762 --> 00:39:59,481
I'm going to let
all you guys down.

1024
00:39:59,532 --> 00:40:00,949
Finn, the graduates,
and my mom.

1025
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:02,150
Jake, you got a second?

1026
00:40:03,152 --> 00:40:04,652
Not now. Can it wait?

1027
00:40:04,703 --> 00:40:07,739
Not really. I need you
to take the dance lead.

1028
00:40:07,773 --> 00:40:09,908
I think I sprained
my ankle during warm-ups.

1029
00:40:09,942 --> 00:40:11,826
You're not limping.
What's going on?

1030
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:17,165
Look, it was really cool
what you did,

1031
00:40:17,216 --> 00:40:19,000
but a few days
of rehearsal and practice

1032
00:40:19,051 --> 00:40:20,468
doesn't make me as good as you.

1033
00:40:20,503 --> 00:40:21,669
And you don't put in

1034
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,304
second-string QB
just to be nice.

1035
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:24,672
Because it's not
nice... the whole team

1036
00:40:24,723 --> 00:40:26,758
suffers, and we <i>have</i>
to win this.

1037
00:40:31,897 --> 00:40:33,982
