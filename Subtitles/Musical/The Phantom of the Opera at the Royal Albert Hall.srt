Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1652
02:17:13,876 --> 02:17:17,879
Gosh, uh, do sit down, for goodness' sake.
I might talk for too long.

1653
02:17:18,506 --> 02:17:21,967
Gosh, when I was a little boy
and I was first brought here by my mother

1654
02:17:22,051 --> 02:17:25,470
when I was five, I think,
to a Promenade concert,

1655
02:17:25,555 --> 02:17:28,390
I think I heard Beethoven's Third Symphony,

1656
02:17:28,474 --> 02:17:31,852
and I don't think I could have ever,
ever believed,

1657
02:17:31,936 --> 02:17:35,063
sitting somewhere up there,

1658
02:17:35,148 --> 02:17:38,191
that anything like this
would ever happen to my music.

1659
02:17:38,317 --> 02:17:41,361
And I have to thank, immediately,
Cameron Mackintosh.

1660
02:17:41,446 --> 02:17:43,989
What an extraordinary production
he's put together.

1661
02:17:47,743 --> 02:17:49,995
Thank you, Cameron.
We'll meet him in a moment.

1662
02:17:50,663 --> 02:17:55,083
But before I go any further,

1663
02:17:55,168 --> 02:17:57,752
the wonderful thing about musicals is that

1664
02:17:57,837 --> 02:18:00,255
something has to happen
that brings them all together.

1665
02:18:00,339 --> 02:18:05,093
I mean, you can have a really great musical
and one aspect of it could be wrong,

1666
02:18:05,178 --> 02:18:06,178
whether it be the production,

1667
02:18:06,304 --> 02:18:08,889
whether it be something to do with
how it's staged or anything,

1668
02:18:08,973 --> 02:18:11,808
and it might get buried
and then take years to find again.

1669
02:18:11,893 --> 02:18:16,605
But what happened so extraordinarily
with this is that everything came together

1670
02:18:16,689 --> 02:18:18,940
with Cameron as the producer.

1671
02:18:19,025 --> 02:18:21,568
Before we go any further, I have to say that

1672
02:18:21,652 --> 02:18:25,614
it would have never happened
without Maria Björnson, and of course...

1673
02:18:25,698 --> 02:18:28,658
Maria Björnson

1674
02:18:32,622 --> 02:18:36,041
was, as all of you know,
the incredible designer of the show:

1675
02:18:36,125 --> 02:18:39,377
It was her vision combined, I think,
with everything else

1676
02:18:39,504 --> 02:18:43,965
that really brought us along.
She tragically died some years ago.

1677
02:18:44,050 --> 02:18:46,635
One of the greatest sadnesses
is that she's not here tonight,

1678
02:18:46,719 --> 02:18:49,763
but I hope we've honoured her spirit
in every way.

1679
02:18:49,847 --> 02:18:53,266
So. Maria, thank you.

1680
02:18:57,396 --> 02:18:59,898
And I ought to say,
tonight's rather extraordinary

1681
02:19:00,024 --> 02:19:03,860
because I know that there are
many companies of The Phantom of the Opera

1682
02:19:03,945 --> 02:19:05,946
watching this performance around the world

1683
02:19:06,072 --> 02:19:08,031
because it's being beamed
around the world tonight.

1684
02:19:08,115 --> 02:19:12,202
And none, I suppose, more important
than the director who made it possible,

1685
02:19:12,286 --> 02:19:16,248
who's in New York at the moment

but I just would like you
to remember John Aron,

1703
02:20:42,418 --> 02:20:45,420
Steve Barton, who of course played Raoul,
and Mary Millar,

1704
02:20:45,504 --> 02:20:50,091
who sadly are no longer with us, but they
were wonderful members of our original team.

1705
02:20:50,176 --> 02:20:52,886
So, a small appreciation to them, please.

1715
02:23:28,125 --> 02:23:30,335
Without these two, we would not be here.

1716
02:23:30,419 --> 02:23:34,214
Uh, we have one slight additional surprise.

1717
02:23:34,298 --> 02:23:36,257
