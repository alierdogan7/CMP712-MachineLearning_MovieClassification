1
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,800
Why are they sending so many
soldiers daddy, if it is only going to
be a little war.

2
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
Make those southern boys take us
seriously this time, my darlilng.

3
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,000
When they realize how much we
want to put a stop to their
nonsense, they'll quiet down.

4
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,800
They'd better. Anyhow, when you
get there, you'll stop them won't you daddy?

5
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,600
I'll do my best dear.

6
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,200
We will miss you so.

7
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,400
I'll be back and we'll be together
again before you can say knife.

8
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,200
I can say knife a good many times
in a year.

9
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,800
At school, you'll have charming little
girls to play with.....

10
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,000
....books to read, a pony to ride and
after all there will be Emily you know.

11
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Yes, there will be Emily. And she does look
as though she'd be an understanding friend,
don't you think daddy?

12
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,200
With that intelletual look, I'm sure of it.

13
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,400
- Not a very cheeful looking school, is it daddy?
- I'm afraid nothing would seem
very cheerful to us at the moment.

14
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,800
Well, maybe it will be better on the inside.

15
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,800
- Of course it will. I'm sorry sir.
- All right, get it out.

16
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,000
- The very idea of delivering a thing
like this to the front door.
- Oh look daddy, my pony.

17
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,200
Your employer will answer to this.
Now take him away. Yes, far away!

18
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,600
- Oh no daddy.
- Oh, I say. Just a moment.

19
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,200
- You are Miss Minchin?
- I am.

20
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
I'm Captain Crew.

21
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,800
- I'm afraid of caused you no end to inconvenience.
- You most certainly have, Captain Crew.

22
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,200
- May I step inside and explain?
- Come in.

23
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,400
- Wait here, I'm returning.
- Very well Captain.

24
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:52,400
-I'm terribly sorry. I had no intention
of having the pony delivered inside your house.
- There are a number of things besides the pony.

25
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,400
Parcels have been arriving here
collect for your daughter for hours.
Follow me please.

26
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,800
Apparently you are not aware,
Captain Crew, that I conduct one of
the most exclusive schools in London.

27
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,800
Yes, yes, I understood. That is
precisely the reason why I brought
my daughter to you.

28
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,400
- I would not have gathered that, by
your actions.
- Really now, I'm not entirely to blame.

29
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,800
You see Sara and I, only just
arrived from India. Sara has lived
there practically all her life.

30
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,200
We no more than got here, when I learned
that my regiment was to leave at once for
South Africa, so we had to act in a hurry.

31
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,800
But I wrote you and explained that l
do not take young ladies without an
interview and impecable references.

32
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,400
I wrote you also, that at the
moment, I have no vacant room.

33
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,600
- Well in that case daddy, we may
as well move on.
- This is a bit awkward.

34
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,800
You see, your letter never reached me and
I'm afraid it never occured to me that any
school wouldn't welcome my little Sara.

35
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,000
If it is a question of my social
standing, my father was Sir George
Crew. You've heard of him, perhaps?

36
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,200
And the best financial references l
can give you would be the director
of the South African Holding Syndicate.

37
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,400
I'm the principal stockholder in the
syndicate.

38
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,200
My brother, Captain Crew, a
professor of dramatics.

39
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,200
- How do you do?
- Charmed, I'm sure.

40
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,400
- I say, isn't the Eclipse Diamond
mines one of your holdings?
- One of the most important.

41
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,600
I'm sorry to appear casual Miss Minchin,
but the siutation is quite distressing. I sail
in an hour to the east Indian docks.

42
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,400
- I expect you'll just have to take me to Africa
with you daddy. - Well, well and what would
a little girl like you do in Africa?

43
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,400
Forgive me Captain Crew. I'm afraid I've
been over zealous. The reputation of my
school you know. One has to be so cautious.

44
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,800
But after this interview, I can see at
a glance, she's a dear little child.

45
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,000
- It'll be a pleasure to have her with us.
- Does that mean I've got to stay?

46
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,000
Yes dear. You are to have that
privilege. You and your little pony.

47
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,200
- What a dear little pony.
- This is made out to the school.
- Is it enough for the moment.

48
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,600
- Oh quite.
- I should say it would. Why it's stupendous.

49
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,800
- I beg your pardon, but haven't I
seen you somewhere before?
- Quite possible my dear Captain.

50
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,800
Your face is most familiar. Were
you ever on the stage? I seem to
associate you with one of the old music halls.

51
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,200
- Musicals? My brother on the stage? Ridiculous.
- Ridiculous indeed, you're quite right.

52
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,400
And now, shall we look at little
Sara's room?

53
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,800
Just a moment Miss Rose. This is
Miss Rose, one of my most capable teachers.

54
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,600
Captain Crew has done us the
honor of placing his little daughter
Sara with us.

55
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,000
How do you do Miss Rose? How do you do
Captain Crew? We shall do everything
we can to make your little girl happy.

56
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,400
Children, we have a new pupil.
Sara Crew. Say how do you do to her.

57
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,000
-How do you do?
- I'm very well, thank you.

58
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,000
Lavina, Jesse, that will do. You
may proceed Miss Rose.

59
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,000
- She's just like a little princess, isn't she?
- That's what she is, a princess.

60
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,000
I expect now, some people around
here won't think they're so smart.

61
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,400
Oh won't they? Wait and see!
Princess indeed!

62
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,600
Fortunately, the room has just been papered
and the fireplace has an excellent draft.

63
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,400
- But I thought you didn't have any rooms?
- I didn't know then what a dear little
girl was coming.

64
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,000
Why does that make more rooms daddy?

65
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,800
Lady Bengiglis daughter has only
recently vacated the room. Our
best suite of course.

66
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,600
Do you think you could brighten it
up a bit? I'd like it made as gay as possible.

67
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,600
brought a few things from India.
Perhaps you could buy whatever
else is necessary.

68
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,200
With pleasure Captain Crew.

69
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:57,800
- I'd like Sara to ride every
afternoon, if that is all right. Of course.
- Fortunately we have a splendid riding master.

70
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,800
I expect you think I am completely
spoiling the child. No doubt you're
right, but actually it's good for her.

71
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,000
She's much too inclined to bury her
cute little nose in a book and keep it
there until someone lures her out of it.

72
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,800
You see Miss Minchin. Sara has no
mother and we've never been
separated for more than a few days.

73
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,400
- How touching.
- This is going to be very hard for her.

74
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,600
Have no fear Captain Crew. I'm a
mother to all my little girls.

75
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And now, I'll leave you to your farewells.

76
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,200
- How much longer have we got, daddy?
- Only a few minutes, darling.

77
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:59,000
-You know me by heart little Sara.
- No daddy, I know you by heart.

78
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,800
You're inside my heart.

79
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,800
We're going to be brave, aren't we?

80
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,400
I'll tell you what. Let's pretend we're
back in India.

81
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,200
And I'm going away with the troop
for a few days. Shall we?

82
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:26,000
We've fought this kind of battle
before, haven't we? And you never
cried once when I went away.

83
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,600
- Remember?
- Yes daddy.

84
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,800
But this is going to be our hardest
battle.

85
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,200
- But we'll be good soldiers, won't we?
- Yes daddy.

86
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,000
- Shall we say good-bye, like we
used to at home?
- Yes daddy.

87
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,600
All right then. Chin up, go to the
window and look out.

88
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,600
Say it as we used to.

89
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,600
My daddy has to go away, but he'll
return most any day.

90
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,400
Any moment, I may see, my daddy
coming back to me.

91
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:39,000
My daddy has to go away, but he'll
return most any day.

92
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,600
I can't do it this time. I can't do it.

93
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:59,600
- You're crying too.
- I'm afraid that we aren't quite the
good soldiers as we thought.

94
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,800
Oh yes we are.

95
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,200
I can do it now.

96
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:16,600
My daddy has to go away, but he'll
return most any day.

97
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Any moment I may see, my daddy
coming back to me.

98
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,800
I will do it! I will! I'll pretend this is
part of a war.

99
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:54,800
You be the enemy and you'll be my
trusty lance. Now ready, aim, fi re.

100
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,600
I guess we'll have to call in the
reserves.

101
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,400
-Good-morning.
- Misses speaks Hindu?

102
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,200
I've lived in India all my life.

103
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,800
Misses is going to live in England now?

104
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,600
- Until my father gets through with
making the boars behave.
- Your father is a soldier?

105
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:40,400
Yes, my father is a captain. Captain
Crew. I'm Sara. What is your name?

106
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,600
I am Ram Dass. Servant to the
Honorable Lord Wickham and Lady Surani.

107
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,400
Ram Dass!

108
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,800
Why are you doddling here? Finish
with that bird and get on with your work.

109
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,400
Good-morning.

110
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,000
How do you do?

111
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,600
I'm up here at the window almost
every morning, in case you want to
talk about India.

112
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,200
Good-morning Sara. Oh, good-
morning. Are you ready for
breakfast my dear?

113
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,200
Well, I'm trying to be, but I don't
seem to be very good at these
buttons. My thumb get lost in the holes.

114
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,200
Here, let me help you. Buttons are
a bother, aren't they?

115
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,800
I've never had to button things
before, but I'll learn.

116
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,400
Here, put your shoe up. Come in.

117
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,800
- Good-morning Becky.
- Good-morning.

118
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,400
- Has the young lady any boots to be done?
- Well, only the pair I wore
yesterday, I'll get them.

119
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,800
I'll get them Miss. Oh I beg your
pardon Miss!

120
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,800
- Are you hurt?
- No Miss you mustn't be helping me Miss.

121
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:58,200
- Just hold out your arms and I'll pile them on.
- Oh no Miss. If Miss Minchin was to see.....

122
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,000
- Think you can hold two more?
- Yes Miss.

123
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,800
There. There we are. Are you all right?

124
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,800
-You take care of all those?
- And she does them beautifully.

125
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,200
- I thank you Miss.
- Thank-you for doing my shoes.

126
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,600
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

127
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,000
Good-bye Becky. Good-bye.

128
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,400
Well, perhaps this isn't going to be
such a bad school after all. With
you and Becky here.

129
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,400
Oh, we'll have to hurry dear. Miss
Minchin doesn't like anyone to be late.

130
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,400
Tell me Miss Rose. Do you think
Miss Minchin could be as cross as she looks?

131
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,600
- What will I have to do today?
- Well, after breakfast, you'll have a
class of arithmatic.

132
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,600
Then English, then french, history
and geography.

133
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,400
I'm going to be a busy person,
aren't I? When do I get to ride my pony?

134
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,200
Later this afternoon. About 4 o'clock.

135
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,400
Children, our new pupil, Sara Crew
will be down shortly.

136
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:09,000
As you've seen, Captain Crew is a
very delightful man and their family
is most distinguished.

137
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,800
I should expect you to treat her accordingly.
Now you may take your places.

138
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,000
- Good-morning.
- Ah, good-morning Sara.

139
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,000
- I'm so happy you feel like joining
us this morning. Did you sleep well?
- No I didn't, thank-you.

140
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,400
Lavina, you and Jesse will move
down one place.

141
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:35,000
-Sara will be seated at my right after this.
- Why Miss Minchin, this has
always been my place.

142
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:52,000
For this food, and all thy bountiful
gifts bestowed upon us, we are duly
grateful and do now give thanks.

143
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:07,200
- Why are you putting salt on your plate my dear.
- Just in case you plan on asking
me to have one of your eggs.

144
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,800
- Mr. Geoffrey. Shall I saddle the pony for
the wee lassie? - I think not Sandy. We'd best
use the mare for her first few lessons.

145
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,800
What luck. The old girl allowed you
to come out.

146
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,000
Sara, this is Mr. Geoffrey Hamilton.
Miss Crew is our new pupil.

147
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,800
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

148
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,400
I believe I am to teach you to ride.
And that means two bob extra to me.

149
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,600
- Is two bob a great deal of money?
- Values are comparative.

150
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,600
-In my present state, it's a fortune.
- Well, in that case, I guess I'd
better be taught.

151
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,800
- Is my pony ready?
-I think we'd best start you off on
something a little tamer.

152
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,400
Then hadn't I better explain things
to my pony. He might feel hurt.

153
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:15,600
Right you are. Ponies are very sensitive creatures.
Explain the whole thing to him, thoroughly.
He's right there by the arch.

154
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,600
- It may take me some time. That's all right.
- We'll wait right here in the tac room.

155
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,200
Hello General.

156
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,600
Are you glad to see me?

157
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,800
Well if Mr. Geoffrey is going to give
me something tamer than you, I'm
afraid it's not going to be much of a ride.

158
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,000
- Rose something's wrong. What is it?
- Miss Minchin is taking away my
Thursday afternoons.

159
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,200
- But why?
- We must have been seen together.

160
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:55,000
- Well does that mean that I can never see you
alone again? Of course not darling. - No matter
what Miss Minchin says, we'll find a way.

161
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,200
I can't understand the woman.What
is she afraid of? Why shouldn't we
see one another.

162
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,200
Gossip I suppose. She only lives
for that school the variety of the
propriety of the snobbisheness.

163
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,200
Fiddlesticks. She's afraid of losing an excellent
teacher whom she gets for nothing. I won't
stand for it. I will have a talk with her myself.

164
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,000
No darling you mustn't do that.
She'd only discharge us both.

165
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,200
She may not have the chance if
things continue to pop in South Africa.

166
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,000
- You mean you might go?
- Wouldn't you want me to if they
call for volunteers?

167
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,000
Of course darling you'd have to.

168
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,800
There is nothing to worry about
now. This poor rumpous will never
get that serious.

169
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,400
I expect I'll have to make my visit a
little longer.

170
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,800
- Oh Mr. Brady is there one this
morning for the little princess?
- We'll see my child we shall see.

171
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:12,000
Of she don't hear from her father
every so often her eyes get that sad
it hurts me to look in them.

172
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,600
-Have no fear little one.
- There is a letter for her this time.
Oh i'm so glad sir.

173
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,400
-A letter?
- It's from my daddy.

174
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,600
-Oh how nice.
- But it isn't.

175
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,800
- It's very bad news. Really?
-What's the matter dear?

176
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:51,000
He says the boys are not behaving
as expeted. And he may not get
here in time for my birthday.

177
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:57,200
But that's months old. So many
things may happen before then.He
can still come.

178
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:04,200
I'm writing Miss Minchin to give you
ar bithday party such as I should
give you if I were there.

179
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:10,600
You are to go on a regular spree.
Buy anything and everthing your
heart desires.

180
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,000
Now last and most important of all
my darling....

181
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,200
...I want you to pause at exactly 2
o'clock on your birthday..

182
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,200
..close your eyes and send me a kiss.

183
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:32,600
For my eyes also will also be closed
and I'll be giving you a kiss too.

184
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,200
Isn't he the most wonderful man in
all the world?

185
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,200
- With one exception...
- Well Mr. Geoffrey is very nice.

186
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
What's that?

187
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,000
- Who are they Miss Rose?
- They are volunteers.

188
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:22,200
- Are they going to South Africa too?
- Yes dear, they're going to relieve
our poor soldiers in Maefking.

189
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,600
- Is there something the matter with
our soldiers in Mafeking?
- The boars have them all cut off.

190
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,200
We were unable to break through
their lines and ger help to them.

191
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:36,600
They're sick and hungry dear and
desprate. They're holding out like
true British soldiers.

192
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,000
Miss Rose my daddy's at Mafeking.

193
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,600
Oh darling I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

194
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,400
Darling you mustn't cry. I'm sure
he'll be all right.

195
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,000
- Good afternoon Mr. Geoffery.
- Good afternoon Madris. Is Miss
Sarah ready for her ride?

196
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,400
She'll be down presently. Thanks.

197
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,000
Oh, are we all ready?

198
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:30,000
The two most beautiful ladies in the
world. Why aren't you in your riding things?

199
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,600
- Oh i can't go today. Ermegard
needs extra tutoring today.
-Oh will it take all afternoon?

200
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:35,600
I'm afraid so.

201
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,200
- I have to stay with her until she
can spell Constantiniopel.
- Heavens that may take months.

202
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,200
You leave that to me.

203
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,800
Shall we go? Have you been
crying?

204
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,200
- But you have, there are still tears
in your eyes.
- It's just this London fog.

205
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,000
Oh well if that's all, lets be off shall we?

206
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:14,200
-Mr. Geoffrey. Would you mind very
much if we didn't ride today?
- Not at all dear. But may I ask why not?

207
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,000
I'd like to talk to you.

208
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,200
It's about Mafeking.Are the soldiers
really starving, sickand cut off from everything?

209
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,600
- You see my father's there so I've
got to know.
- Oh it's not as bad as all that.

210
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,800
They may not be having an easy time of that,
but they're holding out. We're sending in
fresh troops everyday you know?

211
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:41,600
- Why they'll be leaving Mafeking in no time
at all. - It's getting harder everyday to
pretend my father is safe.

212
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Don't you worry. See here, I'll let
you in on at litle secret.

213
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:52,000
I enlisted today and while I don't
Miss Rose to know quite yet, I'll be
going over there quite shortly myself.

214
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,000
- To Mafeking? Well then perhaps
you can help my father.
- We'll get him out.

215
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:04,200
What the blazes are you doing
here? Answer me! What are you doing here?

216
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,400
- Don't be frightened Sara, it's only my grandfather.
- Don't you believe him young
woman. I disowned him the day he was born.

217
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,800
- We're really very fond of each
other. Of course we are.
- What?! We are nothing of the kind.

218
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:20,400
- As a favor to me, will you please
stop shouting at my best paying pupil.
- Pupil? Paying? What are you talking about?

219
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,800
I am master of the horse in this
exclusive seminary of the young ladies.

220
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,200
You take advantage of my absence
to become a riding master? And
next door to me own house?

221
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,200
- Where's your family pride boy?
-Well sir, one must eat, and family
pride is a pretty thin diet.

222
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,400
- Oh, blackmail eh? You'll think I'll buy you off?
- I hadn't thought of that, but it's not a bad idea.

223
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:47,600
I'll see you hang drawn and quartered for that.
Wait till I see the woman who runs this school.
I'll put a spoke in your wheel.

224
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,400
Do! She loved to know that my
grandfather is Lord Wickham. She
probably raise my salary

225
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,800
- Miss Sara, Lord Wickham is coming.
- Then I'm going.

226
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:01,600
Insolent young pup! Just like his
father. Riding master! Bah!

227
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:10,400
- Maybe you're fond of him, but I don't think
he's very fond of you. - Oh he's harmless.
His bark is worse than his bite.

228
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,600
I should hope so. Why is he so mad at you?

229
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,800
Oh he isn't really. He was angry
with my father. I'm mixed up in their quarrel.

230
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,600
What he really wants if for me to
come begging to him for help. He'd
be eating out of my hand if I would.

231
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I don't think I'd care for him eating
out of my hand.

232
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,800
- How would you like to have me
eating out of your hand?
- You? Oh, that would be different.

233
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,400
Well I shall, if you do me a favor.
A very important one. Oh, could I?

234
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,400
I've got an idea that you are the
only one in the world who could.

235
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,000
I want you to get Miss Rose to go
shopping with you next Wednesday.
Shopping?

236
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,800
Well, shopping is as good an
excuse for Miss Minchin.

237
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,000
Really? To Miss Rose?

238
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,800
And she said she would? Oh, that's
wonderful!

239
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,800
- No, not a soul. Not even Emily.
- Good girl! Now we've got to go.

240
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,800
- I must do some prelimanary shopping.
- You don't have to tell me what for.
Something gold and shiny.

241
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,000
Right you are!

242
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Come in.

243
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,200
- Come in.
- Miss Minchin, I wanted to ask you something.

244
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:39,400
- Oh, it's you. What do you want dear?
- I'm going to ask you a big favor. Yes?

245
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,200
Mr. Geoffrey leaving today for the
war, he's been so very nice to me...

246
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,800
...I thought I ought to fill my social
obligations by doing something nice
for him. That's what you teach us, isn't it?

247
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,800
When someone shows you a
kindness, you show them one in return.

248
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,000
Well doing something for Mr.
Geoffrey, scarcely comes under the
rules of social obligations.

249
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,400
- But what is it that you want to do for him?
- May I have him for tea?

250
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,200
- Here? At the school?
- Oh couldn't I please? Since he's
going away to war.

251
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:13,800
Well I suppose it would be for him, since he
was one of the teachers. You need not mention
this to the other young ladies, however.

252
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:19,200
No Miss Minchin. Thank-you Miss
Minchin. Oh Thank-you Miss Minchin!

253
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:45,600
- We must eat something after all
the trouble little Sara has gone to.
- I think she'll understand.

254
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:51,000
- You've forgotten your ring.
- No I haven't....see?

255
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:57,800
I'm always afraid I'll forget and wear it in front
of Miss Minchin. I did yesterday and
fortunately for us, she didn't see it.

256
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,800
- Oh I'd love to tell the old girl.
-Can't do that yet darling. I know.

257
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,600
- Are you sorry you married me?
- As if you didn't know.

258
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I only wanted you to tell me again.
Oh, my darling....

259
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,200
I'll be living this last week over
every moment I'm away from you.

260
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,400
We won't be separated, will we?
Because I'll be living it over too.

261
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,800
- I thought you were having Mr.
Hamiliton to tea?
- I am, I mean I was but.....

262
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,200
- Who's in that room?
- Oh please don't go in there Miss Minchin.

263
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,800
- Miss Minchin, Miss Rose and I.....
- We were saying good-bye Miss Minchin.

264
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:57,800
- How dare you risk the reputation of my school
in this manner. - Nothing has happened to
damage your precious school's reputation.

265
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,400
-As a matter of fact Miss Rose and I.....
- Geoffrey! For my sake.

266
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,400
- Oh please Miss Minchin, it was all
my fault. -Silence!

267
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:11,600
Since you are here to merely say
good-bye, please do so, now.

268
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,400
Good-bye Geoffrey.

269
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,800
- Good-bye Mr. Geoffrey.
- Good-bye dear.

270
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:46,000
-Sara, I shall expect an explanation of this.
- Yes Miss Minchin.

271
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,600
As soon as I can think of one.

272
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,000
- They've been cornered like rats for 7 months.
- I say send more troops to
Mafeking if it takes every man in England.

273
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,800
- I'm with you.
- No! Nooooooooo!

274
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,800
Oh my boy, my boy, my boooooy....

275
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,600
They killed my boy.

276
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,000
I know soldiers are suppose to
stand a lot and my daddy is a good soldier.

277
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:35,400
But they've waited so long for help.
Please do something about
Mafeking right away.

278
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,800
Or they'll all be lost and my daddy
won't come back.

279
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,200
Mafeking is set free. Mafeking is
set free.

280
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,400
Mafeking is set free. Mafeking is
set free.

281
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,400
Oh thank-you for being so quick
about it this time.

282
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,400
Get up, get up! Mafeking is set free.

283
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,200
Wake up everybody! Mafeking is
set free.

284
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,600
- Oh Mr. Bertie! Did you hear?
Mafeking is set free!
- Yes darling, isn't it great news.

285
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,400
Oh Miss Rose, they're saved. My
daddy and Mr. Geoffrey are saved.

286
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:40,000
- What's wrong? Nothing is wrong.
- Nothing, nothing, nothing!
Mafeking is set free.

287
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,200
Oh Miss Minchin, isn't it wonderful?
Can you hear the cheering?

288
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,600
- Oh Sara, I'm so glad for you.
- He's saved Becky! My daddy is saved!

289
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,600
Children, children! Attention please!

290
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:48,600
It is a happy circumstance that Sara's birthday
should fall on a day that we are celebrating
a glorious victory for Her Majesty's Army.

291
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,400
Now Sara. Will you explain to the
children about your wishes for your birthday?

292
00:34:54,400 --> 00:35:00,000
I'm very happy to have you here
and I thought I would like to give
presents today. Not just receive them.

293
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:05,200
I want to show how grateful I am my
father has been rescued. Quiet
children, quiet.

294
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,800
- Can we do the presents now?
- Yes, but your gift first Sara.

295
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:20,800
-This is for you. Oh thank-you Miss Minchin.
- Now all I need is to know how to sew.

296
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,200
And this from the entire school.
Here are pictures of your native India.

297
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:31,800
Oh thank-you ever and ever so much. I
shouldn't have to pretend nearly so hard
when I want to make believe I'm there.

298
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:39,200
-And now, would you like them to have
their presents. - Yes, if you please.
And your names are all on them.

299
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,200
Here you are Miss Rose. Oh, how nice.
Now would you help with the other presents?

300
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,600
- Here you are Miss Rose. Oh, how nice.
Now would you help with the other presents?
- Oh how thoughtful Sara.

301
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:05,400
From one old trooper to another.
Me in younger and happier days.
I was better known as Bobbling Bertie.

302
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,400
- Thank-you. We'd better keep this
present a secret.
- Mums the word.

303
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,400
-Here this is from me. I hope you like it.
-It's just what I wanted.

304
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,200
Mums the word you know.

305
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,200
Here's my present Miss. Many
Happy Returns.

306
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:41,400
- Oh thank-you Becky.
- The material isn't new.

307
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,400
-Why you dear Becky, you made it all yourself.
- Yes Miss. I made it at nights.

308
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,200
I knew you could pretend, I said,
with diamond pins stuck in.

309
00:36:53,800 --> 00:37:00,200
- It's beautiful Becky, I shall love it.
Oh will you Miss?
- The material isn't all new.

310
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,800
- And this isn't so very new either.
- It's my present to you.

311
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,600
- Yes Becky, with my love.
- What is it Miss?

312
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It's a scarab from Egypt. My daddy
gave it to me, because it brings good luck.

313
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,800
I'd rather you had it, than anyone
else I know.

314
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:25,000
- Oh my Miss. I think I'm going to faint.
- Oh no Becky! Not now.

315
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,600
I have lots more presents for you.
Two in my room.

316
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,400
-I don't know what to say Miss.
- You're sweet Becky.

317
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,400
Yes, yes, very nice.

318
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,000
- eg your pardon Miss. Yes? Mr. Barrow of
Barrow and Skippo is here to see you.
- Today? I didn't send for him.

319
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,800
He seems very much upset about
something. He's waiting in your office.

320
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,000
-Miss Rose.
- The scarf is beautiful.

321
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,800
Miss Rose, remember to be sure
and tell me when it's almost 2 o'clock.

322
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:00,800
You know, I have a very special
appointment with my daddy. He's
going to be thinking of me at exactly 2.

323
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,800
- I'll watch the time. Thank-you Miss Rose.
- Oh Sara! Thank-you for the
handkerchiefs, they're lovely.

324
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,000
- Don't you think it's time to cut the cake?
-Oh yes, the cake!

325
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
- Please be seated Mr. Barrow.
- How much did you advance for
this party? Quite a sum, I suspect.

326
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,200
What does it matter. Captain Crew
is a very wealthy man. His check
will be here shortly.

327
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:27,000
- No Miss Minchin. There'll be no check.
- What? What do you mean by that?

328
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,200
The late Captain Crew..... The
"late" Captain Crew?!

329
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:36,400
Captain Crew is dead. He was so
reported in the list this morning.
Moreover, he died bankrupt

330
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,600
-Bankrupt?! But his property, his mines.
- His property and mines were
confiscated by the enemy.

331
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:47,600
You mean to tell me that that child
is penniless? That she's left on my
hands with nothing?

332
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,200
She's certainly left penniless and
she's certainly left on your hands.

333
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,000
- She hasn't a relative in the world that we know of.
- But her father's account is overdrawn.

334
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,200
I was expecting a check, and
advanced the money for this party.
So I understand.

335
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,800
Now you have to make a wish and
blow out all the candles with one breath.

336
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,800
My wish is that my father will come
back real soon.

337
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Now take a big breath.

338
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,800
I haven't got very good lungs, have I?

339
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,000
-I'll turn her out on the streets
-Do you think that's wise Miss
Minchin. The reputation of your school.

340
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,000
My school?

341
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,800
Well the report might get about and
it might not sound well to the
parents of your other pupils.

342
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,800
Yes, that is so.

343
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,600
Of course, the child can be made to
serve in your employ, until her
indebtedness is worked out.

344
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,000
- But that will take years.
- Quite so, but at least it is better
than nothing.

345
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,800
Hurry children, your ice-cream is melting.

346
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,600
- Tara, it's almost 2 o'clock darling.
- Thank-you Miss Rose.

347
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,400
Oh daddy, I'm thinking of you.

348
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,200
And I know, wherever you are,
you're thinking of me too.

349
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,600
Oh Miss Rose. I felt him with me,
I really did!

350
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,200
Miss Minchin wants you dear. Oh,
all right.

351
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,200
- Children, you will leave your gifts here.
- Why? Where are they going?

352
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
-Why can't they take the presents with them?
- Because they are not yours to give.

353
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,600
- But I don't understand.
- You will later. Go to your room now.

354
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,800
- But Miss Minchin.
- Sara, go to your room.

355
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,600
All of you.

356
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:10,200
Now will you tell her what it's all about? What
has happened Miss Minchin? Whatever it is,
you may want to let her off a bit easier.

357
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:15,800
Silence! Captain Crew is dead. His
name appeared on the list today.

358
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:21,600
He left the child a pauper. Oh Miss
Minchin. You had better tell her.

359
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,000
- Oh, I couldn't do that.
- You will do as you are told.

360
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,800
Oh Miss Rose. What's wrong?
Why did Miss Minchin stop the party?

361
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,800
Sara, I want to talk to you dear.

362
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,400
- Oh darling........
-Oh Miss Rose! What is it?

363
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,400
Sara, you're a soldier's daughter.....

364
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:12,600
.....and you know that means being
brave and courageous, don't you?
No matter what happens.

365
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:19,600
- Oh Miss Rose! Is it something awful?
- Your father.....

366
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:26,000
But my father is all right. Mafeking
is set free. You heard them say so.

367
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:33,200
Help didn't get there soon enough
dear, for him. His name appeared
on the list this morning.

368
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,200
- You mean with the wounded?
- No dear.

369
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,200
My daddy is...

370
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,600
Oh Sara, I'm so sorry.

371
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:57,200
It can't be! It isn't true! I won't
believe it! He isn't dead! He isn't!

372
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,200
- Have you?
- Yes.

373
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,200
You may go.

374
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:30,600
You may go.

375
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,400
Come with me.

376
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,600
This is to be your room in the future.

377
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,000
I shall have to sell your furnishings
and clothes, to pay part of the debt
your father owes.

378
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:37,200
Ordinarily, you would go to a
charitable institution, but I'm going
to let you remain here.

379
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,600
There will be duties for you to
perform, of course.

380
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,400
I hope you appreciate my kindness
in not sending you away.

381
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,200
I was unable to fi nd a black dress
among your things, but one of the
girls has given you this.

382
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,200
You'd better take off that party frock
and put this on.

383
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,800
I'll send up some shoes.

384
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:36,000
I don't believe it. I don't, I don't!

385
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:46,800
My daddy has to go away. But he'll
return most any day.

386
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:52,400
Any moment I may see, my daddy
coming back to me.

387
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:01,200
And Miss Minchin is going to sell all
her things.

388
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,600
- It was beastly having to give back
all our presents.
- How do you feel now about your little Princess?

389
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:19,400
- Oh Miss. Is there anything I can
do?
- No Becky, but thank-you.

390
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,800
Sara, I'm sorry.

391
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:41,800
Sara, from now on, you are not to
sit with us. Return to your room
and smooth down those curls.

392
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:46,200
And then go to the kitchen. Run
along now.

393
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,800
Lavina, you may take your old
place, beside me.

394
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:09,400
- Mrs. O'Connel.
- Oh, so the Misses has sent you
down to me, has she?

395
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,600
- Miss Minchin said that I am to have my
breakfast here. - You'll do more than eat
your breakfast if you work for that one.

396
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,600
- I should be glad to help.
- You will eh?

397
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,200
Look at you! Look what you're
doing! For that you'll get no breakfast.

398
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,800
Min, you'd better make some more
toast for the Misses. Right.

399
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:34,800
Here's your breakfast. Take it over
there. We don't associate with royality.

400
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:41,400
- Let me wait on you Miss. No you don't.
- She can wait on herself. You can
sit there and watch her eat.

401
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,400
Perhaps that will teach you a leson.

402
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,600
Please Mrs. O'Connel. May I give
my breakfast to Becky? I'm not that
hungry this morning.

403
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,800
Give it to the cat if you like. Then
get to work and wash them dishes.

404
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,000
No Miss, I don't want it.

405
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,800
The mail just came.

406
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,000
The mail just came.

407
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:58,200
My darling girl. I have been half
mad trying to find a way out of you
since your letter reached me.

408
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:02,000
But it has come! My grandfather
has relented.

409
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:09,800
I pray him, that this money and my
love will help you bear what lies
ahead. Geoffrey.

410
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:16,400
- You say this girl's a teacher at your school?
- She was, until I discharged her today.

411
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,400
We're not likely to hear from her again.

412
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:24,200
And I was prepared to turn over a
handsome sum to that boy when he
got back.

413
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:28,000
I even made an ass of myself and
sent him a check.

414
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:33,000
Then I was right to withhold this.
He made it over to her.

415
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:38,800
- You're not very fond of the girl, are you?
- Hardly, under the circumstances.

416
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:46,000
- Are you sure the girl has no
legitimate claims on him?
- I brought her up from a fondling.

417
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,200
Is it likely, she would not have
consulted me if their love had been respectable.

418
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,600
Ram Dass!

419
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:05,200
Yes sir? In future if any letters or
cables come from Mr. Geoffrey,
they're to be returned, unopened.

420
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,000
As you wish sahib.

421
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Come in Becky.

422
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:33,400
I'm glad you weren't asleep Miss.
It's one of the lonely nights.

423
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:38,200
I wonder where Miss Rose is?
I shall miss her terribly.

424
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:45,600
- We're all alone in the world now, aren't we Miss?
- No, no, we're not alone. There is
my father you know.

425
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:53,400
-Your father? But cook said he......
- You mustn't say that. It isn't true.
He's not dead.

426
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,400
He sick or wounded somewhere, or
he'd send for me. But he's not dead.

427
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:02,600
- How do you know Miss?
- Something inside tells me so.

428
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
And sometimes I hear him calling for me.

429
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,400
All alone Miss.

430
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:22,600
- Buford! You're smoking!
- As you see.

431
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:29,600
- Today my good woman, the British
army is behind me.
- That uniform? You're not going to war.

432
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,800
Quite! To the very cannon's mouth,
if need be. But why? Because old
girl. I've had it to the teeth with your bulling.

433
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:41,400
And your treatment of Rose and little
Sara is the last straw. I prefer the
less painful horrors of the battlefield.

434
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,000
- Are you daring to critize me?
- Astonishing, isn't it?

435
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:49,400
But it proves that I am competent to
lead my men, into the very jaws of death.

436
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,800
- After this, you may never expect
help from me again.
- I am quite calm.

437
00:51:54,200 --> 00:52:00,200
For if the blood-thirsty boar spares
me, the foot-knights will see
Bubbling Bertie once again.

438
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:06,000
-Buford, you wouldn't do that to
me? Oh wouldn't I?
- Well, ta-ta old girl.

439
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,800
If you please sir? What is it lassie?
Were you at the seige of Mafeking?

440
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:51,400
- Aye, that's where I stopped the
bullet that stopped me.
- Then did you know my father?

441
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:55,200
- Your father? What might his name be lassie?
- Captain I Crew.

442
00:52:55,600 --> 00:53:00,000
-Was your father a Captain?
- Yes. They say he is dead, but I
know it can't be.

443
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:06,200
- I've asked so many soldiers about
him. I hope you can tell me.
- No lassie, I'm sorry, I can't.

444
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:11,800
-Why don't you ask in the hospital there?
- Maybe they'll have some record of
him. Thank-you sir, I will!

445
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:22,400
- If you please sir.
- Well the little Princess as I live.

446
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,400
Why Mr. Bertie, I thought you'd
gone to war

447
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:31,800
No, Lord Roberts wanted me to of
course. But he said: "Bertie old
boy, the wounded need you."

448
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,600
So you stay here and cheer up the
brave lads who have fallen in our
dust corps."

449
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
So I'm practically in command of
this hospital.

450
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:45,400
- Oh Mr. Bertie. Can my father be in there?
- Your father Princess?

451
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,000
Yes, you see I know he isn't dead.
I've been looking and looking.

452
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:56,000
He could be among the wounded,
couldn't he? Yes..... I'm almost
sure he is, somewhere.

453
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:01,200
If you're in charge, could I please
look for him in there? Well ah.....
Pleeeeeease.

454
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:05,400
Yes, yes of course you may. Things
like that can happen you know.

455
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:27,600
- Mr. Bertie, why did you join the command here?
- Well disipline in the hospital is rather lax.

456
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:33,000
I say Major. They're waiting for you
in ward B. There is a lot of trash up there.

457
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:38,200
- Very good. I'll get one of my men
to attend to it.
- Get one of your what??

458
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,000
Well then 2 of my men, carry on!

459
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,200
Portor! Sir?

460
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:55,600
- What's this child doing here before visiting hours?
- Well you see... Well, well, well. If you please sir.
The Major is helping me find my father.

461
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:00,400
- The Major?
- For her sir. You see, we're old friends sir.

462
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:04,400
I knew her father, Captin Crew was
reported killed at Mafeking.

463
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:08,200
The child is sure there is some
mistake, so I'm helping her search
among the wounded.

464
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:14,800
- Could you tell me anything about
my father sir?
- Sorry my dear, I can't.

465
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:20,000
- Carry on, Major!
- Yes, sir. Thank-you sir.

466
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:40,400
This little girl's father has been
killed, but she insists he's alive so
I'm letting her look around.

467
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,800
We'll try another ward.

468
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,000
- There's old Bertie.
- Give us a song mate.

469
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,800
Attention men! Attention! Official
inspection.

470
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:22,400
He isn't here either. But someone
might know about him.

471
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:30,400
- If you please sir. Were you at the seige
of Mafeking? - I was that darling.
It's there I got bit by a bug.

472
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:36,400
It was no bigger than the seed of a
thistle and it laid me low. Ah, the
bugs down there are worse than the bullets.

473
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:42,600
- Perhaps you didn't know my father?
- Afraid I wouldn't have known me
own father, with the fever that was on me.

474
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,000
- Thank-you sir.
- It's all right darling.

475
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:04,000
- If you please sir. Were you with the
troops at Mafeking? -Yes, yes of course
I was. That's where I ran away.

476
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:09,600
- Then did you know my father,
Captain Crew?
- Yes, yes of course.

477
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:16,000
- That's a fine looking officer, isn't he?
He ought to do well. - Well when did
you see my father last? Where is he now?

478
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:21,200
Where is who? My father. Oh, one
soldier more or less, doesn't make
any difference you know.

479
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:28,200
I'm making thousands and
thousands for England. Fine strong
fellows, who won't be afraid like I was.

480
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:32,400
I was afraid of the noise. That's
why I ran away you know?

481
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:44,600
- He says he knows my father, but he won't tell.
- He's been living in a dream Sara,
he doesn't know what he's saying.

482
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,200
Don't go yet lad. Give us a song!

483
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:55,400
- How about it dear? Shall we sing
them a song to cheer them up?
- Our old speciality. Not today Mr. Bertie.

484
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:01,400
- Oh come on darling. Let's try and forget our
own troubles and do something for these lads,
shall we? - All right, I'll try.

485
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,200
- What about "The Old Kent Road"?
Yeah, that's the one. Mackie will play for you.
- I'd be delighted Mac.

486
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:24,600
- Mr. Bertie, will it be all right if I come again
tomorrow? - I shouldn't run away too often
Princess. You might get punished you know.

487
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:30,200
- I'll keep a sharp look-out for
whenever the wounded come in.
-You don't really believe he come, do you?

488
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:34,600
Yes, yes, of course I do. I told you
missing men often turn up.

489
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,800
Then I'd better come. You might
not know him, if he's very much changed.

490
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:43,400
- All right dear. You come.
- Good-bye Mr. Bertie. Good-bye dear.

491
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Are you hungry.

492
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,800
Poor little things. There won't be
any worms for you this morning.

493
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:07,000
Good-morning little misses sahib.
Good morning Ras Dass. Feeding
your little friends?

494
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:13,400
-Yes, but I couldn't feed them very
much from my supper last night.
- It is difficult for them when the snow comes.

495
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,600
Rani, Rani!

496
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:24,400
You look as though you are being
naughty and enjoying it.

497
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,600
- Her she is, on the bookshelf.
- Bookshelf?

498
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:34,200
Oh I forgot. I pretend it's a bookshelf
and fill them with beautiful books.

499
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:38,600
Well I'd better remove her, before
she ruins your set of Dickens.

500
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:51,600
This is your room Misses sahib?
It's so old and so high above
everything, it's almost like a nest in a tree.

501
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:57,200
I can lie on my soft sofa and look up
into the sky through that little
window on the roof.

502
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,000
- Sofa? - It looks more like a
soft sofa when it's made up.

503
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:07,200
Can you imagine it has down quilts
and lovely cushions to curl up on.

504
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:16,800
- There is a fire sometimes, of course?
- Well, that is the hardest
sometimes, to imagine.

505
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:23,400
But it's lovely when you can. The
grate shines so when it is polished
and the bright coals on the hearth.

506
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:30,200
- Oh hurry Miss. Cook is in an awful dither.
- Oh my goodness. Excuse me if I run.

507
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:34,200
I've got to go to the butcher. I'll get
my ears boxed if I don't hurry.

508
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:56,200
Listen to this: Hospital Ship Mercy
arrived with 1 200 wounded disembarked.

509
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,200
-Does it give any of the names?
- There ain't no list.

510
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:06,000
Oh I hope my poor Harry's among
them. A wounded husband is better
than no husband at all, eh Min?

511
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:14,400
Oh Becky, I've got to get to the
hospital before 9 o'clock when they
close for visitors.

512
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:23,400
Sara! You clumsy ox! For that
you'll whistle for your supper.

513
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:28,800
Oh Mame, Sara didn't get know
lunch. You put things away before
she got back from the grocer.

514
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:35,600
Who do you think you're talking to?
You'll both go hungry. Now clean
up this mess. Go on, get on with it!

515
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,200
There some sorry cases in this
batch, doctor.

516
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:51,200
Doctor, this man is an unknown.
His papers were lost. Delerium
following maleria fever.

517
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:56,400
- We're very much concerned about him sir.
- Heart action, weak resperation,
well that's to be expected.

518
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:03,600
- He has no lucid moments.
- Temporary paralyzes of some
nerve center or a blood clot possibly.

519
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:07,200
More likely to be the latter sir.
He received a nasty headwound.

520
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:13,600
- He repeated the call of this person Sara.
- You can't know who this Sara is?

521
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,000
No way of finding out sir, until his
identity is established.

522
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:37,400
- You'd better go now Miss.
- I'll finish up for you. Thank-you
Becky. I'll have to fly.

523
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:48,800
Here hold your horses. Where do
you think you're going? Miss Lavina
want's some coal for her fire. Hop to it.

524
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,200
Oh Sara! You look so tired and you
look hungry too.

525
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:05,000
- Are you actually hungry Sara?
- Yes! I am hungry. I'm so hungry I
could eat you!

526
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:21,400
Put on plenty, my father pays for it.

527
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:31,600
Put on plenty, my father pays for it.

528
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:35,400
Come back here and clean up that hearth!

529
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:48,600
I'd like my shawl. The pink one. It's
on my bed.

530
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:55,000
Cover me please. I find the room a
bit chilly.

531
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,200
-Hello Princess, what are you doing out so late?
- I've come to see the new soldiers
that arrived today.

532
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:52,200
- Not tonight my girl. It's closing time.
- But I've got to. I ran away especially.

533
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:56,800
- Please let me in. I'm sure he's
here this time.
- You're sure every time Princess.

534
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:03,200
I'm sorry. You run on home and come
back tomorrow morning. That's a good
little girl. All right, good-night now.

535
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:32,600
He'll recover from the effects of the
fever, but I'm convinced there is
brain pressure.

536
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:38,400
- You advise an operation then? Yes.
Do you agree. - I do and Dr. McNesh
in Edinburgh is the man.

537
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,400
Prepare this man for removal to
Edinburgh tomorrow. Yes doctor.

538
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:07,800
Sara, where have you been?

539
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,400
- Answer me. You've been out, haven't you?
- Yes Miss Minchin.

540
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:17,000
- What do you mean by disobeying my orders?
- I had to, I had to look for my father.

541
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:23,400
All this ridiculous searching for your
father. All this making believe and
refusing to face facts, it's indecent.

542
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:30,000
- I've had enough of it. You must realize
once and for all that your father is dead.
- Don't you say that. He's not dead. He's not!

543
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:35,600
- And you can't stop me from looking for
him either. - How dare you speak to me
in that manner you little......

544
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,800
I'll attend to you further in the morning.

545
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,200
I can't be a good soldier for much
longer. I'm cold and I'm hungry too.

546
01:07:55,600 --> 01:08:02,600
Do you hear? No, you don't hear
and you don't care. You're nothing
but a doll, a doll!

547
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:06,800
You've never had a heart to make
you feel. You're just a doll.

548
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:08,600
Your Highness, please forgive me,
but something has gone amiss.

549
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:12,600
There is an angry woman outside to
report a stolen kiss.

550
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,600
Tell her she must go away. Come
around some other day.

551
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,200
I have told her but she won't. You
must see her, if you don't, she'll
scream her head off.

552
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:26,800
- Tell her to hush. She won't be hushed.
- Then tell her to shush! I'm afraid
she won't be shushed.

553
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:34,000
I won't be hushed, I won't be
shushed, I know my rights and I
know also what I saw.

554
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,600
- What did you see?
- I saw him.

555
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
You saw who? I mean whom?

556
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:43,600
I saw that lad steal a kiss, from that
shameless little miss.

557
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:48,400
Don't be fooled by all their shyness,
they're a wicked pair Your Highness.

558
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:52,400
The Law says in its shining,
that you should not kiss in this land.

559
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,400
There's a law I understand, against
kissing in this land.

560
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:01,200
There is a law that reads like this.
No one is to steal a kiss.

561
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:06,200
Ah but Princess, I've a feeling, this
isn't a case of stealing.

562
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,000
Silence fool. I know the law. What
I say I saw, I saw.

563
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:13,800
She's on a see-saw. What I saw,
you saw, he saw, she saw.

564
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:18,400
On a see-saw. On a see-saw. l
saw, you saw, he saw, she saw.

565
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:22,800
What she tells us may be true. And
if it is, what can we do?

566
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:26,800
If you ask me, we should listen, to
the lad who did the kissing.

567
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:32,000
Let him speak. Come lad this way.
Now then, what have you to say?

568
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:38,000
Please Your Highness, I confess.
When I saw such lovliness...

569
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:43,000
...it was too much to resist. I just
thought she should be kisssed.

570
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:48,200
So I kissed her, kissed her twice.
It was very, very nice.

571
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:53,000
So he kissed her, kissed her twice.
It was very, very nice.

572
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:57,200
There you see, he broke the law.
What I say I saw, I saw.

573
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:01,400
- Please don't start all that again.
- But he stole a kiss, that's plain.

574
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:08,200
Yes, it looks as if it's true and I'll
have to punish you.

575
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:17,000
No please. Let me say a word. It is
not the way you heard.

576
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:24,400
Please, he did not steal a kiss.
I gave it to him. Just like this.

577
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:33,000
There you see, I had a feeling, this
was not a case of stealing.

578
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:38,600
I'm not sure, it's not quite plain,
could I see that kiss again?

579
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:47,000
You were right, I have a feeling, this
was not a case of stealing.

580
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:51,600
Right! The law has been abused.
This lad has falsely been accused.

581
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,800
He's hers and she's hisn's, that old
witch should go to prison.

582
01:12:56,200 --> 01:13:01,000
- You're a very wicked woman.
- Princess, I am only human.

583
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:06,200
Listen to the old grand-mommy.
You're a nasty peeping-tommy.

584
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:10,800
Banish her from here forever.
Never show your face here, never.

585
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:15,000
Banish her from here forever.
Never show your face here, never.

586
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:19,200
But what I say I saw, I saw. I know
my rights, I know the law!

587
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:27,600
Come and sit beside me here. Your
kiss has made things very clear.

588
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:29,800
Thank-you Princess.

589
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:34,400
Don't thank me. Was that kiss, that
set you free.

590
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:41,800
Now we're through with this
arrangement. Let us have some entertainment.

591
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:46,200
Bring the dancers, bring the
singers, bring the good old welting ringers.

592
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:53,600
- The new ballerina? She please you?
- She's a very good dancer. She
looks familiar too.

593
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:30,000
What a nice dream. I feel quite warm.

594
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,600
I don't want to wake up.

595
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,800
I haven't waked up.

596
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:11,200
I must be dreaming.

597
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,400
I am dreaming.

598
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:25,400
I must be dreaming. But it feels
warm.

599
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:29,200
Becky, Becky come quick.

600
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:35,600
- Yes Miss?
- Look!

601
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,400
Oh no Miss. Do you see what I do?

602
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:46,200
- I don't know what you see.
- But I don't believe what I see.
Well, I never.....

603
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:51,800
- Can you feel that? Yes Miss.
- What do you see? I see some fire Miss.

604
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:56,400
And a table with food on it, and a
rug and a lamp, and slippers?

605
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:02,400
I do indeed Miss. How did it all get
here? Did you pretend it into happening?

606
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:07,000
I don't know. I never pretended as
good as this before.

607
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,600
Look at these.

608
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:19,800
- If the little misses sahib knew,
she'd be over here to thank you.
- Who wants any thanks?

609
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:27,200
- Oh Miss! You're beautiful!
- Thanks Becky. Now let's try this one on you.

610
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:36,000
- Isn't it beautiful? Oh yes Miss.
- It's perfect. And real satin too.

611
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:39,400
Let's try the slippers and see if
they're real.

612
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:44,400
- Do they feel like slippers to you?
- They feel soft and warm.

613
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:49,200
This feels soft and warm too.
They're as real as we are.

614
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,400
I don't believe it's a dream after all.

615
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:57,600
- Do you suppose the food is real Miss?
- Let us see.

616
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:05,200
- I can smell kippers, can you?
- Kippers and onions.

617
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,600
I wonder what this is? Muffins!

618
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,800
This tastes like a muffin. Is it one?

619
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:19,000
A muffin that ever was. It must be
the magic Miss.

620
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:22,400
Hadn't we better be quick before it
melts away?

621
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,800
- What sort of night did he have?
- He rested comfortably doctor.

622
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:32,800
- Will we be able to send him with the others?
- Will we be able to send him with the others?

623
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:37,400
Get him ready to be sent with group
D. He'll be leaving in about an hour.

624
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:56,800
I hear you're being punished. Do
you think we ought to offer her a chocolate?

625
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:01,200
- You must let her smell them.
- Miss Minchin surely couldn't
object to that.

626
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:06,200
- Would you care to?
- I don't want to smell them, and I
don't want to eat them.

627
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:11,200
- You don't!? Why not?
- I've had much nicer things than
chocolate this morning.

628
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:16,200
- Listen to the Princess, pretending again.
-I'm not pretending.

629
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:19,600
I had the most wonderful things to
eat, that anyone had.

630
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:25,600
- Why you little liar. You haven't
even had breakfast.
- Pardon me, but I really have.

631
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:29,800
Excuse me for saying so, it isn't
polite to call people liars.

632
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:36,200
- How dare you talk back to me.
-Was I doing that? My goodness.

633
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:40,400
So sorry.

634
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,600
You wait til I tell Miss Minchin on you!

635
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:53,000
Well, everything is still here Becky.

636
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:57,000
- Thank heavens it's stopped raining.
- Are you going some place Miss?

637
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:01,400
To the hospital. Becky, perhaps
everything is going to change for us.

638
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:05,400
Perhaps I'll find my father this time
and he'll take us away from here.

639
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:09,800
Oh no! It's the Misses.

640
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:13,800
Sara, how dare you......

641
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:19,000
- Why, what's happened to this room?
-That's what we would like to know.

642
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:23,600
When I woke up this morning, here
everything was. Even to the food and the fire.

643
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:30,800
- Where did you get these things? - I don't
know. Maybe because I dreamed such a
beautiful dream last night, that it came true.

644
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:35,000
These articles are rare and costly.
You stole them, didn't you?

645
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:39,800
- Oh no Miss Minchin. We didn't take
these things. - I'll give you one more
chance to tell me the truth.

646
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:44,800
- But I am telling you the truth.
- They just came. Yes, they did
indeed Mame.

647
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:48,600
You go to your room. This is a
matter for the police.

648
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:52,400
- Oh please Miss Minchin. Please
don't call the police.
- Of course I'll call them.

649
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:07,600
- Oh we're prisoners sure enough
Miss, and the police coming too.
- I can't be arrested.

650
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:14,000
- Those new wounded men are at
the hospital and I got to get to them.
- I don't see how you can Miss.

651
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:18,000
Come on Becky, quick. Where are
we going Miss? Follow me.

652
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:24,600
- Oh I'm so frightened Miss. I'm
frightened this time too.
- Come on Becky, give me your hand.

653
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,600
- Oh low Miss.
- Don't be afraid Becky.

654
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:47,600
- Ah, what game is this little Misses sihib?
- Can we please go through your
house? We're running away from the police.

655
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,600
- And a very nice game to. Would you enter?
-We would like to, very much indeed.

656
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:06,200
- You seem in great haste Miss
sihib. Will you not stop for a cup of tea?
- Oh no thank you. We're in too big of a hurry.

657
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,400
Oh, I see. You are still playing the
game of the police.

658
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,800
- I hope you escape in safety Miss sihib.
- So do I. Oh low Miss, police!!

659
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:19,000
- There they are! Stop them!
-Becky, run, run!

660
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,200
Sara, Becky! Stop where you are!

661
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:29,200
Go after the other one. I'll take care
of her.

662
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:34,000
Watch out Becky, don't slip. Becky,
where are you?

663
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,600
- Wretched little beast. You'll go to jail, both of you!
- You'll never catch Sara. Mr. Bertie
will see to that.

664
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:03,600
So that's where she's gone. Well did you find
them Mame? Take this little thief and don't
let her out of your sight till I return.

665
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:08,800
- Did you catch her? She dodged her way
into traffic. - I couldn't find her anywhere.
Do you know where she's likely to be?

666
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:11,200
I do. Cabbie!

667
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,400
Harvard Hospital and hurry please.

668
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,800
He never stops calling for her.

669
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,800
Step aside a little bit will you? Ah,
ah, ah. You can't go in there.

670
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:54,000
- No visitors allowed for an hour.
- But that might be too late.

671
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:57,800
Now run along little girl, will you?

672
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:04,800
- I'm sorry sir. No visitors allowed
for an hour.
- But we must go in.

673
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:08,200
Sorry sir. You can stand over there,
if that's all right.

674
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:21,400
- Have you seen Captain Marks?
- I believe he just went through the hall Miss.

675
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:27,200
- Sorry young one, but you can't go upstairs now.
- But I've got to. I've got to see if my father is
here before Miss Minchin catches me.

676
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,200
Run along now. Do as you are told.

677
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:35,400
I say there. You come back here.
You can't go up there.

678
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:40,600
You can't go in there.

679
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,600
Let me go, let me go. I want to be
here. I will! I will!

680
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,600
Porter!!

681
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:52,200
What is it the child wants?

682
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:57,400
- Please, please don't let them take
me away.
- What is it child?

683
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:02,000
My father. They say he was killed
at Mafeking, but I don't believe it.

684
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:06,000
He may be with the new wounded
men, but they won't let me look.

685
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:11,400
If they don't, perhaps I'll never have
another chance. Can't you make
them let me look.

686
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:18,000
Colonel. Could you see that this
child is escorted through the hospital?

687
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:23,200
With permission, I shall accompany
her personally Your Majesty.

688
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:31,400
- What is your name?
- Victoria. What is yours?

689
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:37,000
Sara.......Oh Your Majesty!

690
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,600
Colonel.

691
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:52,600
I hope that you will fi nd your father
my dear. A thorough search Colonel.

692
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:58,400
- Oh thank-you Your Majesty.
- Good-bye my dear.

693
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:12,600
- Have you been through any of the wards yet?
- Not today sir.

694
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,800
I think we'd better cover this wing first.

695
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:31,400
We are searching for a patient.
Move right along dear.

696
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:38,200
- Is it all right?
- Thank-you darling.

697
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,000
- Miss Rose!
- Sara darling!

698
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Oh Mr. Geoffrey. You're home,
you're back again. You can tell me
where my daddy is.

699
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:59,400
Well Geoffrey didn't get as far as
Mafeking dear.

700
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,400
Then you don't know? You didn't
even see him?

701
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:10,800
No dear, I didn't. I'm sorry.

702
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:15,800
- Have you found him?
- Oh, no sir.

703
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:20,600
This is my friend Mr. Geoffrey and
his wife. Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton.

704
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:25,200
- Mrs. Hamilton. - I'm afraid I can't
introduce you, because I don't know
your name. - I'm Colonel Gordon.

705
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:30,000
- This is Colonel Gordan. He's
helping me search the hospital.
- Oh, don't bother. How do you do sir?

706
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:33,600
I'm very happy to know you both.
From Mafeking?

707
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:40,200
- No sir. An army mule, a British
mule at that.
- That's adding insult to injury.

708
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:45,000
-Sorry sir, but it's time for the
patient's drops.
- Well, I'd rather face that mule.

709
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:49,400
I'll come back later Miss Rose. Just
as soon as I've gone through the
other wards.

710
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:53,200
- I'll wait for you dear.
- Good-bye.

711
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:56,800
- Be sure to come back Sara.
- I will.

712
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:04,400
Poor little thing. She'll never stop
hoping.

713
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:11,000
- I insist that you send for my brother.
-Very well Mame, but you can't get
in. Brother or no brother.

714
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:17,200
- We will get in. My brother will see to that.
- I hope you're right Mame.

715
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:31,400
All filled now. This man will have to
wait until the next ambulance.

716
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,600
I think you'd better take him into the waiting
room. These halls are much too drafty.

717
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,600
- I very sorry that you couldn't find your father.
- Thank-you just the same sir.

718
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,800
He may be on the next convoy of
wounded. I wouldn't give up hope.
I won't sir.

719
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:55,000
- Good-bye and God bless.
- Good-bye.

720
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:03,200
I know that they were stolen. That is
perposterous! I can prove it and I
intend to turn her over to the authorities.

721
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:08,600
She is in this hospital and I intend
to find her. I insist that every room
be searched.

722
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:28,800
Sara...

723
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,200
Sara...

724
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,200
Daddy...

725
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:46,200
Daddy, daddy! It is you! I found
you, I found you!

726
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:50,000
They said you were dead, but I
knew you weren't. I knew you'd
come back.

727
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:56,600
Oh daddy, hold me, hold me close.
You won't ever go away again, will you?

728
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:02,800
What's the matter daddy? Why
won't you talk to me?

729
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:07,200
Don't you know me daddy? I'm
Sara, I'm Sara.

730
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:12,200
- Where is my daughter?
- Oh daddy, something's happened to you.

731
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:17,000
Mr. Bertie! Mr. Bertie! Oh daddy,
you've got to know me.

732
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:20,000
Look at me!

733
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:29,600
You mustn't cry. You mustn't cry.

734
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:36,400
- We must be good soldiers you know.
- But I have been a good soldier
daddy, but you don't know me.

735
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:42,800
- My little Sara never cries.
- But I'm Sara, I'm Sara!

736
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:52,000
Yes, yes,...Sara! Sara!

737
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:56,000
Sara, my darling. My baby Sara.

738
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:01,800
Sara my darling. My little Sara.

739
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:12,800
- Oh don't be ridiculous Amanada. - Well then
how do you account for those silk covers, those
robes and those other things that are there.

740
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:19,000
Perhaps a little bird brought them in. Perhaps
they grew legs and walked in. I don't know.
One thing I do know is little Sara wouldn't steal them.

741
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:24,200
Bertie! Yes? Berties, what do you think has
happened? Little Princess has found her father.
She's found him!

742
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:28,800
- Captain Crew is alive?
- Of course he's alive! How could
she find him if he wasn't alive?

743
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:36,800
- Oh Mr. Bertie, I found my father.
- Darling, I'm so glad.

744
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,400
Daddy, it's Your Majesty.

745
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:54,200
My daddy.
