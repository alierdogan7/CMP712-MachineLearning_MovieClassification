00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:10,710
Welcome back to magical student week on Wheel of Fortune!

3
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,860
If you're just joining us, our
magical student contestants are...

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,500
From Hogwarts academy, student Harry Potter.

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,500
<i>And school groundskeeper</i>
<i>hagrid.</i>

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,500
Gryffindor, Gryffindor,

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,580
You're the house I'm playing for!

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,850
Go Hogwarts, yay!

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,680
Neat.

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,620
Also playing for
middle earth middle school...

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,530
<i>Gollum and smeagol,</i>

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,670
Who not only share the same rock,

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,940
But also share the same naked,
relatively hairless body.

14
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,980
I'm smeagol.

15
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,880
I love the "wheel-ses"

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,960
Almost as much as my precious.

17
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,620
And I'm gollum,

18
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,960
And I'd rather be on

19
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,800
"minute-ses
to win it-ses."

20
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,630
Finally, playing for forks high,

21
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,570
It's Bella and Jacob.

22
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,010
I'm playing for Bella.

23
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,780
<i>No.</i>

24
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,720
I'm playing for Bella.

25
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,530
It's like I'm watching one
of the "twilight" movies,

26
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,800
Except I'm awake.

27
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,700
This one, Harry, he's a
right lord of the zings.

28
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,940
Right? Right? Oh!

29
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,610
All right, on the board we have...

30
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,880
<i>One more letter</i>
<i>and we'll have a winner.</i>

31
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,950
I'd like to try to solve the puzzle.

32
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,950
As a wizard, I'm quite good at spelling.

33
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,760
Get it?
"spell-ing." right?

34
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,990
You may be the boy who lived, Harry,

35
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:46,800
But that was the joke that died.

36
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,630
Oh, snap-seses!

37
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,040
Up top!

38
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,800
<i>Sorry.</i>

39
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,640
The phrase is "the wizards oo waverly place."

40
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,650
Nope. All the os
are up there, Harry.

41
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,020
That's how we play the game.

42
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,820
Looks like a big break for the
naked brothers from middle earth.

43
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,520
I wants to solveses it for the preciouses.

44
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,560
No!
I'll solve.

45
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,630
<i>"the wizards of..."</i>

46
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,760
- Yes.
- "...Waverly..."

47
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,930
- Here it comes.
- ...Precious.

48
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,540
And there it goes.

49
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,910
Bella, the door is wide open.

50
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,970
<i>Don't talk to Bella.</i>

51
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,910
She's mine.

52
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,980
Edward... wow.

53
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,850
Up close, you are sparkly.

54
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,750
And a mint wouldn't kill you.

55
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,820
Nothing can kill me.

56
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,990
<i>Bella,</i>
<i>I need you to choose.</i>

57
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,830
Pass.

58
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,000
Don't really have passes in this game,

59
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,670
But all right.
Harry, back to you.

60
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,600
Pass!

61
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,770
Seriously? Okay.
Gollum, take us home.

62
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,780
Pass-eses.

63
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,010
There is no passes in this game, guys.

64
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,010
The letter is "f."

65
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,020
Jacob, just say "f."

66
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,990
I'm gonna spin.

67
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,890
What?

68
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,890
I mean pass.

69
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,830
<i>Ni'm</i> gonna pass.

70
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,800
Why do you have to whoosh?

71
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,930
<i>I like to whoosh.</i>

72
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,640
- Yes, but...
- Wait, I solved it!

73
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,010
"the wizards
oo waverly place."

74
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,580
<i>still wrong, Harry.</i>

75
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,880
- I got something to say.
- Yes.

76
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,850
That's it.

77
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,920
Why would you take off
your shirt for no reason?

78
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,790
Why would you?

79
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,620
That makes no sense.
Where's my shirt?

80
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,590
And where's
your pants-eses?

81
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,730
Okay, that's it.
Magical student week is over.

82
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:52,900

Not me, no.

169
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,930
But, Mr. Goodman, how do we close our
books to a chapter that doesn't exist?

170
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:11,570
Yeah, how do we do that?

171
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,840
I don't know.
Don't ask me.

- I don't play by the rules.
Turkey Turkey! - Whoa!

173
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,580
Yeah! All right! Whoo!

174
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,780
That's right. I know what
you're thinking, kids.

175
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,720
When's this cool teach sporting wheel shoes.

176
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,990
Gonna play this guitar?
Am I right?

177
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,790
Actually, we're just wondering
when we're gonna learn something.

178
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:38,030
Right about now, Holmes broseph.

179
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,900
Mixed nuts!

180
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,770
You just learned that
I don't play the guitar.

181
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,810
<i>You know what else</i>
<i>I don't play?</i>

182
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,010
By the rules. I got wheels in my shoes.
That's how I roll.

183
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,950
All right, Mr.
Goodman going around the world.

184
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,980
Low fives, everybody.
All right! Yeah, whoa!

185
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,060
I'm cool.
I'm cool.

186
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:07,630
- Kids, I'm cool. I'm cool.
- Mr. Goodman, are you...

187
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,760
Easy, kid.

188
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,630
You don't need to raise your
hand to ask a question in here.

189
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,840
That's right.
You got a question,

190
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,770
You don't raise your hand.
You lower your foot.

191
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:22,580
But how are you gonna know
if we're lowering our feet.

192
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,610
If they're already touching the floor?

193
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,820
I don't know. Don't ask me.
I've got an ear piercing.

194
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,720
Hawaiian pizza! Oh!

195
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,890
Check that out,
that's gross! Eww!

196
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,590
Oh, that hurt!

197
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,860
A boring old normal teacher
would have regretted that,

198
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,030
But not me, 'cause I
don't play by the rules.

199
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,970
So I'm gonna go home and blog
about how much I enjoyed it.

200
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,640
All right!

201
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,770
Mr. Goodman,
I have a question.

202
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,710
Well, I can't hear you.

203
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,650
Because one: I've got a bit
of an ear situation going on,

204
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,750
B: You raised your hand,

205
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,050
And p.S.: Everybody,

206
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,720
Mr. Goodman.

207
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,020
Is a boring old normal teacher name.

208
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,660
Boo hoo hoo hoo!

209
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,760
<i>From now on,</i>

210
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,600
You'll all
call me Mrs. Bad woman.

211
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,930
Soy sauce!

212
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,070
Ow! Worth it.
Totally worth it.

213
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:29,740
Ahh!

214
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,880
A normal teacher wouldn't
have karate chopped.

215
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,880
His desk in half right about now,

216
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,850
<i>But I don't play</i>
<i>by the rules,</i>

217
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,050
So I had to karate chop my desk in half.

218
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,650
My wrist hurts pretty bad right now,

219
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,060
My knee is starting to swell,

220
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,790
And this ear is gonna need a stitch.

221
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,760
A normal teacher would probably
have the school nurse check it out,

222
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,960
<i>But not me.</i>

223
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,070
No, I'm gonna have a janitor ignore it.

224
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,840

332
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,790

333
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,660
