1
00:01:54,767 --> 00:02:00,911
God's own child

2
00:02:23,467 --> 00:02:26,641
Who is this...early in the morning?
Lift him up

3
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:03,237
City of Chennai welcomes you

4
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:06,740
No-good nut case! Get lost

5
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,903
You don't want your money?

6
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:31,410
Nila...?

7
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,478
What?

8
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:34,573
Nila

9
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:36,476
You lost someone?

10
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,074
I'll tell you where to go

11
00:04:45,933 --> 00:04:50,279
Keep this in your shirt
Not in your pant pocket

12
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:57,409
What's your name?
Where are you from?

13
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:01,145
Krishna

14
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:03,304
...from Avalanchi

15
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:06,678
Chocolate factory

16
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:12,412
Gate...cows

17
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,745
Give me time to write
Repeat what you said

18
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,336
- What's your name?
- Krishna

19
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,571
What do you want?

20
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,740
I want Nila

21
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:38,271
Nila is missing

22
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,210
Doesn't look like you lost someone
You are the one who seems lost!

23
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,077
- Someone must be searching for you
- I want Nila

24
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:47,613
This is a police station
You shouldn't be here

25
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,909
Come with a friend, relative or a lawyer

26
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:55,108
You'll find a lawyer in court

27
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:03,440
It's time to go to the court
Shall we leave?

28
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:08,278
Make sure everyone boards the van

29
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,371
Rape or drugs? Tell me what case

30
00:06:26,467 --> 00:06:27,445
We'll take you out in a jiffy

31
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:29,274
Go in like this
Out in a jiffy like that

32
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:31,608
Go in...get out
We'll take you out in a jiffy

33
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,646
What are we here for?

34
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:38,680
Hey! You there!

35
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:41,278
How did you get in here?

36
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:44,943
Get down

37
00:06:46,967 --> 00:06:48,275
This one is without a lawyer!

38
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,874
Go in like this
Out in a jiffy like that

39
00:06:52,967 --> 00:06:54,446
- What's your case?
- Murder

40
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,103
- How many?
- One

41
00:06:57,467 --> 00:07:00,846
Just 1? I expected much more from you

42
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:04,676
- Whom did you kill?
- Lawyer who defended me and lost

43
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:08,069
You are my lawyer from now on

44
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:12,172
I am not a lawyer
I'm a tea shop owner

45
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,643
How come you are dressed this way?

46
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,104
Because it's so cold, sir

47
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,005
You have even started
selling tea and coffee, sir?

48
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:27,080
- Looks like that will be my job!
- How can you say that, 'Mr Lawyer'?

49
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,280
- What did you call me?
- 'Mr Lawyer'

50
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,275
Looks like I myself need to be reminded

51
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:35,144
Why don't you get me a case?

52
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:39,978
Look at that man over there in a sweater
Catch hold of him

53
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:41,171
Good one?

54
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,270
My boss is a very experienced lawyer

55
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:51,608
You can go in like this
Be out in a jiffy like that

56
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,974
You don't worry about it

57
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,010
Stop!

58
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,443
Grab him, sir

59
00:08:17,533 --> 00:08:21,709
He claims he will kill a lawyer
Kaatumiraandi! Senseless savage!!

60
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:23,942
Dented tin-head!!

61
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:35,043
Many a miss between
the mouth and the magistrate!

62
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:44,276
Don't you worry, sir

63
00:08:44,367 --> 00:08:46,870
Come in

64
00:08:46,967 --> 00:08:48,947
Please be seated

65
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,277
I've got hold of a super client
Come to our room immediately

66
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:07,104
I'm inside the court room
Call me later

67
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,579
it's not as if you are defending a case
You are just gaping at the proceedings

68
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:11,941
Come out

69
00:09:21,033 --> 00:09:24,606
I never thought
I'll get back my property so soon

70
00:09:25,467 --> 00:09:28,277
- Anu, how long?
- I'm coming

71
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,706
I only wanted
what's my rightful inheritance

72
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:36,638
You blatantly lied
that I am not my dad's son!

73
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:40,271
If you had come to me first
I'd have said the same about him

74
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,838
I'll take care

75
00:09:50,033 --> 00:09:52,274
How many times
to tell you not to call me 'dear'?

76
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:54,777
Why are you irritated?
You haven't got a case till now?

77
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:58,442
Mind you r business!

78
00:10:05,433 --> 00:10:06,844
It's some missing case

79
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:10,779
Imagine! He must be filthy rich to
roam around Chennai wearing a sweater!!

80
00:10:10,867 --> 00:10:13,473
He must forever be used
to air conditioning

81
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:26,646
I'll call you discreetly from inside
Let's pretend to be in great demand

82
00:10:28,933 --> 00:10:33,382
We are dependent on him this month
Don't mess it up as usual

83
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:55,207
That's my business card for you

84
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,970
How can I help you?

85
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:18,146
Who are you?
Where did you come from?

86
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:20,338
Krishna

87
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:28,675
Goats...cows

88
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:30,371
Not cows

89
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:36,475
Lots of trees

90
00:11:36,933 --> 00:11:38,674
There's a huge tree

91
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,476
There's major feud
between the Ambani brothers

92
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:45,810
They want you to fly to Delhi tonight

93
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,881
I'll tell them you won't come
without completing this case

94
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:56,738
You were saying...

95
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:09,476
Gate...goats...cows

96
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,636
There's a huge tree

97
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:21,710
Your client is waiting out with
Rs 150000 for winning his case

98
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,310
I'm so sorry I blurted
your fees in front of our client

99
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:31,644
You continue...

100
00:12:33,467 --> 00:12:36,539
That huge tree

101
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,579
Is he still at that same tree?!

102
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:48,147
I put chocolates into a bag...tie it...

103
00:12:57,767 --> 00:13:02,307
Goats and cows lying down by the roadside

104
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,140
I'll be right back

105
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:14,338
What are you up to?

106
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,437
Urgent case

107
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:20,479
She needs to get divorced
She's getting married this evening

108
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,136
You got to help her right now

109
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,813
Listen to me

110
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,810
Nila (moon) will be seen tonight
We'll hold it safely for you

111
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,471
You come back tonight

112
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,480
You couldn't have found a better case!

113
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,804
How did I know he'd be a nut case?

114
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,313
Go and get a good case

115
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,674
Serves me right for not studying well!

116
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:11,308
Why is he still here?

117
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,405
You ask me to bring in a case for you
Then you ask me to pack him off

118
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,275
What do you take me for?
'Use and throw'?

119
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:20,143
Fine...how do we go out now?

120
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:26,512
Drink this tea
I have ordered lunch

121
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,672
Usually we try to get our client out

122
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:34,011
Now, we are breaking our heads
how to get ourselves out!

123
00:14:38,967 --> 00:14:40,913
What's this new case I'm unaware of

124
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:48,545
That's a political recommendation

125
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,979
You blabbered to that man
you won't grant him divorce!

126
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,776
What are you glaring at me for?

127
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:38,440
Pig faced bum...grab him
He threatens to kill lawyers

128
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:41,377
Kaatumiraandi! Barbaric beast!!
Put him behind bars

129
00:15:41,467 --> 00:15:46,007
We can't, sir
He is out on bail

130
00:15:51,967 --> 00:15:53,275
If you are free you can visit my shop

131
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:56,007
Grab a bite and a cup of tea or coffee

132
00:16:03,867 --> 00:16:06,006
Let's run this way
Mr Sweater is there

133
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,505
This nutcase

134
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,177
How many times to tell you?!!!

135
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,109
He had Anu's card
I found him for you

136
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,580
This place is swarming with maniacs!

137
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,345
Get lost

138
00:16:34,467 --> 00:16:36,708
You want Nila?

139
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:41,009
We'll go bring it for you
You be here

140
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:44,171
Don't follow us

141
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,743
We'll be back soon

142
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:53,704
Just wait for us here

143
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,238
Moon...moon

144
00:17:10,267 --> 00:17:15,046
When, where, whom
we meet can be pre determined

145
00:18:10,267 --> 00:18:11,712
Are you Anu?

146
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:15,035
Court closes at 6:00 P.M

147
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:19,172
We asked him to leave
We even beat him to a pulp

148
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:20,712
He's refusing to budge from here

149
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,570
We found your business card on him
Do you know him?

150
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,708
You promised...to bring Nila...for me

151
00:18:32,267 --> 00:18:36,044
It seems he is Krishna
He is mentally challenged

152
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,041
Avalanchi is a small village near Ooty

153
00:18:40,233 --> 00:18:44,545
I found out a Mr Victor
owns Emerald chocolate factory

154
00:18:44,633 --> 00:18:49,082
He's the only person to know
Krishna 's story fully

155
00:18:52,033 --> 00:18:57,346
They took Nila away

156
00:18:57,433 --> 00:19:00,744
I want my Nila

157
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,210
Please wait out...

158
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,110
if he gets too emotional
his blood pressure will rise

159
00:19:17,633 --> 00:19:19,306
Who is Nila?

160
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,204
Is Nila his wife?

161
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,507
Or his sister?

162
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:33,610
Who is Nila?

163
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,713
Hey look there! What's Krishna up to?

164
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:36,546
Get down

165
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:50,876
You should be in your home
You shouldn't be down

166
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:53,206
You are such a tiny baby

167
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,877
Why are you so happy?

168
00:21:35,267 --> 00:21:40,876
I'll soon have a baby of my own
A mini girl or boy

169
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:46,508
She or he will ask me
to buy many a cuddly toy

170
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,446
From today I'll dance and rejoice

171
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:54,208
...in absolute joy!

172
00:22:06,433 --> 00:22:11,974
I'll soon have a baby of my own
A mini girl or boy

173
00:22:12,067 --> 00:22:17,574
She or he will ask me
to buy many a cuddly toy

174
00:22:17,733 --> 00:22:21,510
From today I'll dance and rejoice

175
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,877
...in absolute joy!

176
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,810
It will take an hour for me
to reach Cunnoor

177
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,541
How slow can you be...no fear at all

178
00:22:35,633 --> 00:22:39,376
Relax! Don 't be angry
Krishna isn't here...that's wh y

179
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,235
What did he say?

180
00:22:44,367 --> 00:22:46,404
Cat got your tongue?

181
00:22:50,567 --> 00:22:52,513
I can't digest it myself

182
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,581
You won't be able to bear it
You are better off not knowing

183
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:56,905
I am better off not knowing?

184
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,308
What did he say?

185
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:01,573
Where are you going?

186
00:23:01,733 --> 00:23:03,041
I want to see Victor

187
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:04,578
Aren't you working?

188
00:23:06,433 --> 00:23:10,404
I am having a baby
I won't be working

189
00:23:10,633 --> 00:23:12,738
Now that you are here you might
as well tell me loud and clear

190
00:23:16,133 --> 00:23:19,580
I am having a baby
I won't be working

191
00:23:26,267 --> 00:23:29,476
We must deliver the chocolates in time

192
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:32,514
Only you can do it,
we can't trust these guys

193
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,409
Be a sport

194
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,641
What are you doing here?

195
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,010
Murthy asked me to work

196
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,606
I swear on my wife
I didn't ask him to work

197
00:24:21,533 --> 00:24:24,275
He has to be in hospital
Why are you delaying him?

198
00:24:24,367 --> 00:24:28,509
I agree totally
What are you doing here?

199
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,408
Krishna never lies

200
00:24:32,267 --> 00:24:34,440
Did Bhanu give you a list?

201
00:24:36,067 --> 00:24:39,139
Murthy, drop Krishna in the market
when you go for delivery

202
00:24:39,233 --> 00:24:42,442
Buy everything, go to the hospital
I'll see you later

203
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,076
What do you have to buy?

204
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,976
I 'll buy kaajal for her twinkling eyes

205
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,842
Tiny anklets as a tinkling device

206
00:24:52,934 --> 00:24:55,642
Oh! 1 more in my to-do list

207
00:24:55,834 --> 00:24:58,713
Why don't I remember what it is?

208
00:24:58,934 --> 00:25:01,642
A blue shirt for that pretty face

209
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:04,441
I'll add a pink dress just in case

210
00:25:04,533 --> 00:25:07,241
Let me shop till I drop

211
00:25:07,334 --> 00:25:09,837
On a horse I'll gallop!

212
00:25:09,933 --> 00:25:13,073
All for the baby?
Nothing for Bhanu?

213
00:25:14,133 --> 00:25:15,703
Oh! You bet Bhanu will get

214
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,576
An apple to keep the doctor away

215
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:21,443
Horlicks in milk everyday

216
00:25:21,534 --> 00:25:24,105
Bhanu, my love so fair

217
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,646
just like my baby I shall care

218
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:29,441
Jeweled necklace like a crown

219
00:25:29,534 --> 00:25:32,310
Waist thread to show my baby has grown

220
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,074
1 more to tick in my dream list

221
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,204
Oh right here...this is it!

222
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,281
- Is this also for Bhanu?
- No, for the baby

223
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:46,577
I'll soon have a baby of my own
A mini girl or boy

224
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:52,578
She or he will ask me
to buy many a cuddly toy

225
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:54,910
No need

226
00:26:50,733 --> 00:26:53,612
Krishna, should the baby
be like the mom or dad?

227
00:26:54,334 --> 00:26:57,076
Not a carbon copy of her dad

228
00:26:57,167 --> 00:26:59,841
...nor like his mom, for I'll be glad

229
00:26:59,933 --> 00:27:02,641
...if God decides to add
a bit of both mom and dad!!

230
00:27:02,733 --> 00:27:05,771
Baby should laugh with joy never be sad

231
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:11,510
Is this that beautiful laughter?

232
00:27:11,834 --> 00:27:14,178
What do we get when the baby is born?

233
00:27:14,267 --> 00:27:17,111
Lots of chocolates shall be my treat

234
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,010
Whole of Ooty will enjoy a feast

235
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,944
What else shall I add to my wish list?

236
00:27:23,067 --> 00:27:25,013
I'll think and tell you what it is

237
00:27:25,967 --> 00:27:28,208
Okay, what will you do with the baby?

238
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,376
I'll watch him play...with other kids

239
00:27:31,467 --> 00:27:34,141
Tease hen..mock fight with counter bids

240
00:27:34,234 --> 00:27:36,714
What else will I do...?

241
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,610
- What will you do?
- I'll ask Bhanu and tell you

242
00:27:40,133 --> 00:27:42,272
You won't play with Bhanu?

243
00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:45,041
Apparently I have to wait
for 300 days long

244
00:27:45,133 --> 00:27:47,773
It seems the baby
has to grow real strong

245
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,710
Till then I'll Middle my thumbs and wait

246
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:55,271
So said the doctor that's my fate!

247
00:28:00,367 --> 00:28:02,278
Take this with you

248
00:28:07,867 --> 00:28:10,438
- Where are you going?
- I'm having a baby

249
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:58,345
You've got a baby girl

250
00:29:24,534 --> 00:29:27,344
I gave your hand back to you

251
00:29:30,767 --> 00:29:32,440
I am your daddy

252
00:29:36,867 --> 00:29:43,682
Does she look like me or Bhanu?

253
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,540
Where is Bhanu?

254
00:29:50,634 --> 00:29:53,774
Bhanu isn't here

255
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,003
She has to nurse the baby

256
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,880
When will she come?
Where has she gone?

257
00:30:04,967 --> 00:30:07,607
She's with God

258
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,440
Take one last look

259
00:30:29,167 --> 00:30:34,167
Fair moon...silver moon
Fluffy cloud here's looking for you

260
00:30:40,467 --> 00:30:50,286
Precious image of you asleep
on my chest dissolves into a tear so blue

261
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:02,376
You are sitting there
oblivious to the baby's cries

262
00:31:04,933 --> 00:31:07,140
What should I do?

263
00:31:07,234 --> 00:31:14,243
My dear life, without you
I am not alive today

264
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:21,481
- Babies need milk once in 3 hours
- Really?!

265
00:31:24,167 --> 00:31:29,640
Only because of you
my heart is shattered honestly

266
00:31:29,734 --> 00:31:35,377
I remember...l reminisce
I long for you, my dear

267
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:41,480
I search for your fragrance
in the atmosphere

268
00:32:01,867 --> 00:32:03,813
Take care
Don't drop the baby

269
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:40,313
I won't talk to you

270
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:55,248
Muruga...Muruga...lyappa

271
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:59,644
Why won't you talk?
What wrong did he do?

272
00:32:59,733 --> 00:33:01,974
Wasn't March 21 st your birthday?

273
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,881
But he wasn't with us
Let us not talk to him

274
00:33:06,967 --> 00:33:08,674
We won't talk to you

275
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,538
Why are you crying like a baby?

276
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,204
Not me...baby is crying

277
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,143
Hush! Don't cry

278
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:29,278
- Baby! Whose baby is this?
- Bhanu and me

279
00:33:29,367 --> 00:33:30,607
What is her name?

280
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:35,877
Sita...Rama...jungle...cuckoo

281
00:33:36,867 --> 00:33:41,646
Don't name her
Everyone will call her by that name!

282
00:33:48,133 --> 00:33:49,806
Nila (moon)

283
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:56,977
Her name is Nila

284
00:34:07,967 --> 00:34:11,972
This is Nila

285
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,273
Daddy

286
00:34:14,367 --> 00:34:16,313
Look up...mummy

287
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,437
She is refusing to eat
Tell her, Bhanu

288
00:34:24,867 --> 00:34:26,244
Did you call for me?

289
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:28,335
I got a complaint

290
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:33,314
For every kilo there is a shortage of
50 grams in what you delivered

291
00:34:33,434 --> 00:34:34,913
But it was fine when we loaded the stuff

292
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,377
Does that mean you sold them on the way?

293
00:34:36,467 --> 00:34:40,142
I swear on my wife

294
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,308
You can go

295
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:46,313
Not you

296
00:34:46,933 --> 00:34:48,970
Why do you always swear on your wife?

297
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,373
Why don't you swear on yourself?

298
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:56,381
1 more complaint like this,
you are sacked

299
00:34:57,334 --> 00:34:59,314
- What is the weight of this?
- 2 kgs

300
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,474
- When you load them?
- Same

301
00:35:03,633 --> 00:35:06,773
- When you deliver them?
- Same 2 kgs

302
00:35:06,867 --> 00:35:11,577
Then how can 50gms be less
when the load reaches the shops?

303
00:35:12,234 --> 00:35:15,181
Must have melted in this Ooty weather!

304
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,345
Come and sit in front

305
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,710
I am sure you are the culprit

306
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,179
You claimed it thawed in the Ooty sunlight

307
00:35:40,267 --> 00:35:42,008
If our boss gets to know this...

308
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:46,173
Yeah, you let go of what you should be
concentrating on and suspect me!

309
00:35:46,334 --> 00:35:47,836
What did I miss?

310
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:51,835
They pack the chocolates

311
00:35:51,934 --> 00:35:53,379
I load it in the van

312
00:35:53,634 --> 00:35:55,409
You drive the van

313
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,502
Van leaves the factory

314
00:35:57,634 --> 00:35:59,477
- That's all
- Then what?

315
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,473
Baby will cry!

316
00:36:20,433 --> 00:36:21,503
What's up?

317
00:36:24,034 --> 00:36:25,604
Where are you walking off to?

318
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,145
They pack the chocolates

319
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,271
You load it in the van and I drive it
Van leaves the factory

320
00:36:31,367 --> 00:36:33,244
- Then what?
- Baby will cry

321
00:36:33,334 --> 00:36:35,177
That's what I plan to check

322
00:36:45,434 --> 00:36:48,313
After the van leaves the factory
you said the baby will cry

323
00:36:48,434 --> 00:36:49,640
Why didn't she cry?

324
00:36:49,734 --> 00:36:52,908
You came back, that's why she won't cry

325
00:36:54,467 --> 00:36:56,674
Watch the baby cry now

326
00:37:06,434 --> 00:37:08,675
Why is she gurgling?

327
00:37:14,367 --> 00:37:17,177
Why don't you park to the side?
What are you doing here?

328
00:37:17,267 --> 00:37:18,337
What's he saying now?

329
00:37:18,734 --> 00:37:21,340
No, let me not repeat it
You'll feel sad

330
00:37:21,534 --> 00:37:23,673
Don't call me names in your language

331
00:37:24,267 --> 00:37:25,405
- Wait
- What?

332
00:37:26,534 --> 00:37:29,276
Tangludu!#! @#&**:>\dhaydurr!!!

333
00:37:29,367 --> 00:37:30,243
What did you say?

334
00:37:30,334 --> 00:37:31,108
You didn't understand, right?

335
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,009
You get mad likewise!

336
00:37:34,267 --> 00:37:35,678
Where are Murthy and Murugan?

337
00:37:35,967 --> 00:37:38,675
I said it for your good
It's your call

338
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:41,738
Give me a straight answer

339
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,501
I'm here, sir

340
00:37:43,734 --> 00:37:46,840
Why won't the chocolates be missing
if the truck is left unattended?

341
00:37:50,734 --> 00:37:52,873
Did Murthy and Murugan come here?

342
00:37:54,267 --> 00:37:55,837
No

343
00:37:56,034 --> 00:37:57,638
Let me know when they come

344
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:00,578
What room is this?

345
00:38:03,034 --> 00:38:04,843
Oven?

346
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:14,512
31 -32-33-34-35-36...

347
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:21,207
Victor has been looking for you
I'll let him know you are here

348
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,507
Wait here

349
00:38:24,934 --> 00:38:27,505
Victor, do you know where Murthy is?

350
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:37,217
- You didn't see me
- No, but I saw you now

351
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:44,243
Tell Victor you didn't see me

352
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:46,677
it's wrong to lie

353
00:38:47,967 --> 00:38:49,913
it's alright if it's for a good cause

354
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,480
- it's wrong to lie
- Don't keep muttering the same dialog

355
00:38:52,567 --> 00:38:54,012
Be clear and loud

356
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,511
it's wrong to lie

357
00:39:18,634 --> 00:39:20,204
Where did you go?

358
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,039
Baby has stopped crying

359
00:39:38,867 --> 00:39:44,283
You are such an idiot
How can you suspect our Krishna?

360
00:39:44,367 --> 00:39:47,439
He is so naive
How could you suspect him?

361
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:52,542
Yesterday I got muddled
Do you think you can fool me, you thief?

362
00:39:58,334 --> 00:40:01,110
- What's so funny?
- I feel sad for you

363
00:40:01,467 --> 00:40:04,141
- Why do you feel sad for me?
- Leave it, bro!

364
00:40:04,234 --> 00:40:06,043
Tell me

365
00:40:10,967 --> 00:40:17,851
When 2 people are involved
isn't it enough if I knows what to do!?

366
00:40:23,334 --> 00:40:31,253
Say 'daddy'

367
00:40:31,334 --> 00:40:34,178
She called me 'daddy', Raji

368
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,114
Look at the way he is calling her Raji
so casually in front of you!

369
00:40:48,067 --> 00:40:50,172
Stop obsessing

370
00:40:53,933 --> 00:40:56,914
Are you all jobless?

371
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,844
Why are you sitting here
in this cold listening to him?

372
00:40:59,934 --> 00:41:01,379
Go home and sleep

373
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:06,249
She called me 'daddy'

374
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:12,849
All babies only say 'ma' first

375
00:41:13,867 --> 00:41:16,313
- But she did call me daddy!
- You are such a nitwit

376
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,438
Raji, it's getting late
Come, let's go home

377
00:41:19,533 --> 00:41:22,844
- Dad
- Don't go

378
00:41:41,534 --> 00:41:48,315
This is a dad's lullaby

379
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:54,316
Hearing her 'baby-talk'
Mother earth sparkled with greenery

380
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:02,512
Dad doubles as mom,
in this endearing phase

381
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:08,050
His doodles designed
a masterpiece of grace

382
00:42:08,134 --> 00:42:11,479
2 souls unite to become 1

383
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,346
Lovingly, he continues...all alone

384
00:42:23,067 --> 00:42:29,507
Tear drops plead for a parasol
brimming in the eye-space

385
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:36,313
This is a father's lullaby

386
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:43,375
Listening to this child's voice
Mother earth painted new scenery

387
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:35,081
Drops of water bonded to be born as rain

388
00:43:35,167 --> 00:43:41,880
Though rain did stop
trees drizzled again

389
00:43:41,967 --> 00:43:45,972
Just a kid even if he's an adult by age

390
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:55,681
Still a chili
she takes her mother's image!

391
00:43:55,767 --> 00:44:01,274
No other bliss can rival this happiness

392
00:44:01,367 --> 00:44:04,974
l sense God only through her eyes

393
00:44:08,234 --> 00:44:12,649
Worldly wisdom this
unconditional love defies

394
00:44:16,234 --> 00:44:21,081
Tear drops urge for an umbrella
from the alcove of their eyes

395
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,670
Why is the tree so tall?

396
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,941
Because its dad is tall, that's why

397
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,737
Why is the crow so black?

398
00:44:34,234 --> 00:44:37,647
Roaming all day, it gets tanned by the sun

399
00:44:40,434 --> 00:44:42,539
Why is the elephant so big?

400
00:44:43,434 --> 00:44:47,610
It has a HUGE appetite, that's why

401
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,941
Where is mummy?

402
00:44:55,767 --> 00:44:57,212
She is with God

403
00:44:58,167 --> 00:45:01,410
Doesn't God have His own mummy?

404
00:45:07,434 --> 00:45:15,478
Victor says God likes to keep
good people by His side

405
00:45:17,767 --> 00:45:20,145
We are not good?

406
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:44,602
Shall we return their ball?

407
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,202
Do you like this school?

408
00:46:54,834 --> 00:46:57,610
Can I also play if I join this school?

409
00:46:58,367 --> 00:47:02,816
Sure, you can play and study well
You'll be a doctor 1 day

410
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,538
Why should I become a doctor?

411
00:47:04,967 --> 00:47:07,743
So that you can take care of your dad

412
00:47:15,367 --> 00:47:17,608
Do you like this?

413
00:47:18,767 --> 00:47:23,216
Krishna...this looks used

414
00:47:23,367 --> 00:47:25,870
Someone's worn it and kept it here

415
00:47:28,167 --> 00:47:30,204
You can't take all this

416
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,076
Which school?

417
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,175
If you don't know the school's name,
leave now

418
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,638
Give me the money

419
00:47:47,867 --> 00:47:48,971
Take the money

420
00:47:51,467 --> 00:47:55,244
Balance?
What about balance Rs 180?

421
00:47:57,667 --> 00:47:59,704
Pay the balance and take this tomorrow

422
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,373
Spoiling my day
early in the morning

423
00:48:11,334 --> 00:48:16,511
Give me money, bro
Fast...we need it

424
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,310
This is all I have

425
00:48:22,934 --> 00:48:25,312
My share...my mother gave me

426
00:48:27,534 --> 00:48:29,445
Krishna, here is my share

427
00:48:30,334 --> 00:48:32,780
Is this enough?

428
00:48:35,067 --> 00:48:36,774
Balance?

429
00:48:36,867 --> 00:48:38,244
I have to give you

430
00:49:20,267 --> 00:49:21,905
Keep the bag in front

431
00:49:25,734 --> 00:49:28,180
Go in, dear!

432
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,103
Sit
Must not cry

433
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,504
What is your name?

434
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:14,642
Your name, please?

435
00:50:22,734 --> 00:50:23,644
What happened?

436
00:50:23,733 --> 00:50:25,644
Come down
Let's go

437
00:50:29,734 --> 00:50:31,771
Let's go home

438
00:51:26,734 --> 00:51:29,647
Krishna is here

439
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,103
Nila is here

440
00:51:33,467 --> 00:51:36,038
What did he do?

441
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:38,580
Made dosas (pancakes) so yummy

442
00:51:38,667 --> 00:51:42,410
Krishna fed Nila

443
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,605
Full became Nila's tummy

444
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:47,475
Nila baby's tummy is happy?

445
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:58,280
When will I become a doctor, daddy?

446
00:52:00,834 --> 00:52:06,477
Tomo...few days...no... many days later

447
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,610
Can I take care of you
only after I become a doctor?

448
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,275
Shall we play again?

449
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,506
Krishna is here

450
00:52:24,567 --> 00:52:25,409
Let m e see

451
00:52:29,967 --> 00:52:32,607
Nila, what are you drawing?

452
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:35,540
Why is your page blank?

453
00:52:36,034 --> 00:52:37,604
Why don't you do your home work daily?

454
00:52:37,967 --> 00:52:40,208
Her dad is mad

455
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:50,547
Complete your homework from tomorrow

456
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:53,478
Otherwise you won't be allowed
into the class...understood?

457
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:58,413
- Kishore, where's your drawing?
- He is not mad

458
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,270
- What's your name?
- Nila

459
00:53:17,434 --> 00:53:20,005
- Which class?
- Lower kindergarten

460
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,404
Why are you here?

461
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,537
Are you a teacher?

462
00:53:28,567 --> 00:53:30,342
Student?

463
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:35,411
If I don't finish my home work
Ramya miss will scold me

464
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,945
Your mom doesn't help you at home?

465
00:53:37,034 --> 00:53:38,138
I don't have a mummy

466
00:53:38,234 --> 00:53:40,214
- Where is she?
- With God

467
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:46,739
- Daddy?
- Daddy...

468
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:57,807
My dad heads not just this
but 18 schools in Tamil Nadu

469
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,278
We have a different approach to education

470
00:54:00,834 --> 00:54:06,682
It isn't enough to be a teacher
You must be a parent too

471
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:09,744
Ramya, I shouldn't see any child
standing outside the class room

472
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,411
I can't get the signal here
I'll come out and talk

473
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,044
I can't hear you

474
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:24,203
- What's your name?
- Shweta

475
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:27,076
- What are you doing here?
- This is my room

476
00:54:27,834 --> 00:54:31,077
Oh! You have a room?

477
00:54:32,233 --> 00:54:33,473
What do you do?

478
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:35,205
Just like that

479
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:40,272
Won't Ramya miss yell at you
if you don't do any work?

480
00:54:41,167 --> 00:54:42,271
She won't

481
00:54:42,367 --> 00:54:44,540
If anyone scolds you, come and tell me

482
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:31,147
We are celebrating
1st anniversary of our school

483
00:55:31,234 --> 00:55:34,215
We will conduct story telling and
poetry recitation competition

484
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:37,804
Correspondent has said
every child should participate!

485
00:55:39,367 --> 00:55:43,406
- Correspondent means?
- She is a big teacher

486
00:55:44,367 --> 00:55:46,472
Give me your names and contest names

487
00:55:58,867 --> 00:55:59,845
What?

488
00:56:21,667 --> 00:56:22,771
What's the matter?

489
00:56:22,867 --> 00:56:26,576
I believe a big dinosaur
has come to school

490
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,906
- Dinosaur?
- One big Miss

491
00:56:32,067 --> 00:56:34,377
- Not correspondent?
- Yes

492
00:56:36,734 --> 00:56:40,978
We are supposed to tell rhymes and stories

493
00:56:41,067 --> 00:56:42,512
Will you help me?

494
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,641
What do you want to be taught?
Story or rhyme?

495
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,775
Which one do you know?

496
00:56:52,134 --> 00:56:53,044
Both

497
00:56:54,533 --> 00:56:58,174
Then you can yourself tell big dinosaur

498
00:56:58,934 --> 00:57:00,845
Who is big dinosaur?

499
00:57:03,134 --> 00:57:05,774
Small dinosaur is Ramya miss

500
00:57:06,334 --> 00:57:12,376
- Corres...
- Correspondent?

501
00:57:12,467 --> 00:57:15,971
Correspondent is the big dinosaur

502
00:57:16,534 --> 00:57:18,309
Children are waiting to be dropped

503
00:57:18,867 --> 00:57:21,507
I'll drop Nila
Give the address to my driver

504
00:57:44,734 --> 00:57:46,236
Nila didn't come

505
00:57:47,067 --> 00:57:48,512
Nila didn't come
Go away

506
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,973
Stop!

507
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,303
Don't make me run behind you

508
00:58:16,334 --> 00:58:20,180
I've run 4 kms in school and pedaled 8 kms

509
00:58:20,267 --> 00:58:21,974
He's made me sweat even in this cold!

510
00:58:22,067 --> 00:58:23,307
Where is his daughter?

511
00:58:23,734 --> 00:58:25,304
She should have reached long ago

512
00:58:26,067 --> 00:58:28,308
Correspondent said she would drop her

513
00:58:29,667 --> 00:58:32,307
- Why didn't you say this earlier?
- I forgot

514
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,243
You dim-witted guy!

515
00:58:39,734 --> 00:58:40,838
Where were you so long?

516
00:58:41,934 --> 00:58:43,311
You could have given me the house key

517
00:58:44,267 --> 00:58:45,837
Her teacher waited and just now left

518
00:58:45,934 --> 00:58:47,641
Not teacher, Shweta

519
00:58:50,267 --> 00:58:52,975
- Is she angry?
- Very much

520
00:59:39,467 --> 00:59:44,314
Daddy, will you also leave me like mom?

521
00:59:44,467 --> 00:59:45,844
I will never do that

522
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,375
You were the one who left me

523
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,375
Do you know where all I searched for you?

524
00:59:50,934 --> 00:59:53,039
- Driver's house...school
- They didn't tell you?

525
01:00:00,367 --> 01:00:01,869
I believe I must tell a story

526
01:00:02,634 --> 01:00:04,614
That's why it got delayed

527
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,077
Story?

528
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:12,479
I'll tell you a story
But you should come back early

529
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:14,137
Do you know to tell a story?

530
01:00:15,367 --> 01:00:17,745
- I know plenty of stories
- Tell me

531
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,670
I'll tell you tomorrow

532
01:00:24,167 --> 01:00:25,805
But you shouldn't leave me

533
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:28,506
I feel terrible without you

534
01:00:31,234 --> 01:00:37,276
If I am missing again
tell that Nila (moon)

535
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:40,473
That moon will tell me

536
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,275
What are you doing here
without loading the stuff into the van?

537
01:01:00,234 --> 01:01:02,271
Nila has to tell a story in her school

538
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:05,280
So Krishna has been hassling everyone

539
01:01:06,167 --> 01:01:07,805
- Who is the victim?
- You!

540
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:09,938
How?

541
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:15,881
I don't know any story to tell

542
01:01:15,967 --> 01:01:17,674
You must tell

543
01:01:18,167 --> 01:01:20,340
He is the root cause for all problems

544
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:26,344
- I really don't know
- I won't let you go

545
01:01:31,034 --> 01:01:33,344
- Haven't you left for the shops?
- Haven't you?

546
01:01:37,234 --> 01:01:38,542
Tell her to tell me a story

547
01:01:39,634 --> 01:01:42,672
You want a story, right?
I'll tell you

548
01:01:42,967 --> 01:01:46,141
- Do you know to tell a story?
- I do...come

549
01:01:49,867 --> 01:01:51,869
Do you know to tell stories?

550
01:01:52,434 --> 01:01:54,345
I know many stories

551
01:01:54,567 --> 01:01:56,808
But Krishna cannot understand them

552
01:01:56,900 --> 01:02:02,407
As long as either the story teller or listener
is expressive, isn't it enough?

553
01:02:13,567 --> 01:02:14,545
Story

554
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:18,538
How long will you be this way?

555
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:23,541
Is this a story?

556
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:29,013
Won't you begin with
'in a far away land'?

557
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:31,671
Let us talk about your story

558
01:02:32,367 --> 01:02:34,347
How long can you be single?

559
01:02:35,034 --> 01:02:40,347
You are young and handsome

560
01:02:41,967 --> 01:02:43,344
Fair complexioned

561
01:02:44,833 --> 01:02:46,403
You have a good set of teeth!

562
01:02:47,634 --> 01:02:50,740
Get married, so you and
Nila can be taken care of

563
01:02:50,834 --> 01:02:55,078
How can he get married again?
Knowing his past story...

564
01:02:55,167 --> 01:02:57,738
Nowadays which girl wants intelligence?

565
01:02:58,234 --> 01:03:00,339
They'll be happy with someone like him

566
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:05,747
I'll find a suitable wife
to take care of you and Nila

567
01:03:09,434 --> 01:03:12,813
But Raji is there to take care

568
01:03:19,234 --> 01:03:20,679
Should I say it loud and clear?!!

569
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,871
Raji is there to take care

570
01:03:36,233 --> 01:03:39,544
Krishna is here

571
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:46,807
I want to tell you a story

572
01:03:48,567 --> 01:03:49,671
Story?

573
01:03:52,634 --> 01:03:53,806
What story, daddy?

574
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:03,603
- Which one shall I say?
- Story...for what joy?

575
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:07,204
What if someone steals
your story and makes a movie?

576
01:04:08,767 --> 01:04:11,179
Tell her the crow story

577
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:17,043
Which one shall I tell?

578
01:04:22,067 --> 01:04:25,640
Tell the story of the King! King of Kings!

579
01:04:27,467 --> 01:04:29,413
Tell her the story of Maestro Ilaiyaraja!

580
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,511
I'll tell you a royal story

581
01:04:44,867 --> 01:04:47,370
In a far away land...

582
01:04:53,134 --> 01:04:55,171
...there lived a king

583
01:04:55,267 --> 01:04:58,908
- Did the king live all by himself?
- No, of course!

584
01:04:59,467 --> 01:05:03,438
He had ministers
his yes-men 4

585
01:05:03,534 --> 01:05:04,638
Side kicks??

586
01:05:05,667 --> 01:05:09,911
In a land there lived an emperor!

587
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,380
As good as stooges,
were his ministers 4!

588
01:05:16,867 --> 01:05:19,245
Once there was war in the country

589
01:05:26,334 --> 01:05:28,507
In the war everyone fought

590
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,837
Once there was war in the country

591
01:05:35,934 --> 01:05:37,914
In the war everyone fought

592
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,037
Amidst the fight; bombs blasted!

593
01:05:40,134 --> 01:05:41,579
Dom! Dom! Dom!

594
01:05:41,667 --> 01:05:43,840
But why fight?

595
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,710
Why did the battle begin?

596
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,838
Why did the battle even begin?

597
01:05:53,934 --> 01:05:56,312
The crow stole a fritter...that's why

598
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,437
War happened suddenly

599
01:05:58,533 --> 01:06:00,570
...because crow stole a fritter
with its beak

600
01:06:00,667 --> 01:06:04,376
Cunning fox asked the crow
to sing Do Re Me...

601
01:06:04,467 --> 01:06:06,105
Crow sang...really?

602
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,372
Oh! The crow can't sing!

603
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:13,442
Avvww...poor crow had nothing!

604
01:06:13,534 --> 01:06:15,377
You think the king will let it go?

605
01:06:17,933 --> 01:06:22,040
King started to sing off-key
Fox dropped the fritter hurriedly

606
01:06:22,134 --> 01:06:26,981
Crow said Thanks, Your Majesty! '

607
01:06:27,067 --> 01:06:31,379
Entire kingdom rejoiced happily

608
01:06:31,467 --> 01:06:35,506
With his tail tucked in, the fox fled

609
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:39,173
'Long live our king', everyone said

610
01:06:39,267 --> 01:06:47,243
Long live our king!
Long Live His Majesty!

611
01:06:47,334 --> 01:06:50,781
Is this the story of the crow or king?

612
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,776
it's the story of the Crow-King!

613
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:07,783
Hail our Crow King! Hail our Crow King!

614
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,071
As a master story teller l think...l ponder

615
01:07:10,167 --> 01:07:12,204
Amused, you appreciate
in big eyed wonder

616
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:14,280
I have more stories
to reel out from my mind

617
01:07:14,367 --> 01:07:16,677
For you to hear..applaud...unwind

618
01:07:16,767 --> 01:07:20,806
In a land there lived an emperor!

619
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:22,937
As good as stooges,
were his ministers 4!

620
01:07:23,034 --> 01:07:25,412
Again King's story?

621
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:34,140
Oh! Not another King's story!

622
01:07:44,567 --> 01:07:46,410
But this is a different king!

623
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,608
What did this king do?

624
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:19,442
His kingdom was troubled
by a dinosaur for long

625
01:08:19,533 --> 01:08:23,504
So the people complained
to the king very strong

626
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:27,776
As Superman, to kill this dinosaur dead

627
01:08:27,867 --> 01:08:31,906
their king should go, they requested

628
01:08:36,734 --> 01:08:41,240
Anaconda terrifies the king
all the way through

629
01:09:09,867 --> 01:09:14,247
After that...a tornado
storms on him too

630
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:22,376
Anaconda terrifies the king
all the way through

631
01:09:22,467 --> 01:09:26,506
After that...a tornado
storms on him too

632
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:30,639
Sabre-toothed tiger roars
that's what happens next!

633
01:09:30,734 --> 01:09:35,240
All the people exclaimed
'Long live Your Majesty'!

634
01:10:11,934 --> 01:10:15,245
Why was the tiger killed?
Shouldn't the dinosaur die?

635
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,244
All the people exclaimed
'Long live Your Majesty'!

636
01:10:32,334 --> 01:10:35,247
Okay daddy...I've heard enough

637
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:39,907
I tell you tales
all through the night

638
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,980
You analyze-paralyze
wrong and right

639
01:10:42,067 --> 01:10:44,138
I have more stories up my sleeve

640
01:10:44,234 --> 01:10:46,544
for you to listen, laugh, (dis)believe!!!

641
01:10:46,634 --> 01:10:50,605
Once upon a time there was a Highness

642
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:55,012
listening to this story
Nila sleeps in happiness

643
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:03,407
I am going to sleep now

644
01:11:03,767 --> 01:11:05,269
Has Nila slept?

645
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:18,007
All my stories I repeat

646
01:11:18,234 --> 01:11:21,807
sleepily you listen to this dreamy treat

647
01:11:22,101 --> 01:11:25,878
My story has a sequel

648
01:11:25,967 --> 01:11:29,813
Just for you
audio visual so special

649
01:11:31,501 --> 01:11:34,880
- Go and bring him
- Who are you?

650
01:11:34,967 --> 01:11:37,345
Let me go

651
01:12:14,967 --> 01:12:16,207
When is it Nila (moon)'s turn?

652
01:12:16,901 --> 01:12:18,539
- Should I tell both rhymes?
- Just 1 will do

653
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:22,870
After No moon I believe

654
01:12:24,834 --> 01:12:26,279
Do you remember everything?

655
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:31,181
- Should I tell both rhymes?
- Just 1 will do

656
01:12:44,934 --> 01:12:47,574
You didn't seem to miss me
That's why

657
01:12:48,134 --> 01:12:50,637
- You didn't even tell me?
- We are engaged

658
01:12:50,734 --> 01:12:52,645
Do I need permission to see you?

659
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,310
Let's see

660
01:13:26,867 --> 01:13:28,039
She'll come

661
01:13:31,667 --> 01:13:36,377
Do you want to see Nila?
Come, let's go

662
01:13:52,534 --> 01:13:55,037
They just now left
How will they come back so soon?!

663
01:13:55,867 --> 01:13:57,312
Daddy!

664
01:14:27,167 --> 01:14:28,202
Come on, tell

665
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,338
Do you know the rhyme?

666
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:42,142
You go on to the stage

667
01:15:15,567 --> 01:15:19,140
We adults have a lot to learn
from these children

668
01:15:23,834 --> 01:15:26,815
Nila and Arun share the first prize

669
01:15:29,967 --> 01:15:31,344
They are calling Nila to take the prize

670
01:15:32,034 --> 01:15:37,950
We invite our correspondent
Shweta to give the prize

671
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:41,075
Ma'am, please come to the stage

672
01:16:09,567 --> 01:16:11,740
Krishna should be the one to be thanked

673
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:15,738
He has brought up his daughter
as innocent as him

674
01:16:22,434 --> 01:16:23,538
Can we leave?

675
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:26,675
1 minute...we'll come

676
01:16:27,834 --> 01:16:29,142
Shall we go, Krishna?

677
01:16:29,234 --> 01:16:31,942
Who is with Nila?

678
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:34,738
Let's leave after a while

679
01:16:35,301 --> 01:16:37,247
Nila's dad, Krishna

680
01:16:38,867 --> 01:16:40,369
Her mom?

681
01:16:40,734 --> 01:16:42,577
Bhanu is her name

682
01:16:43,534 --> 01:16:44,444
Where is she?

683
01:16:45,134 --> 01:16:46,511
She died very young

684
01:16:50,001 --> 01:16:52,038
What are you saying?

685
01:16:52,267 --> 01:16:58,775
Good or bad, she should have
married someone with sense

686
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,305
He killed her through sheer neglect!

687
01:17:04,734 --> 01:17:07,772
Now this kid is stuck with him
like a garland in a monkey's hand!

688
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,102
Wonder when he will kill this child?

689
01:17:11,067 --> 01:17:13,707
No one can eat or sleep
in peace thanks to him

690
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:20,045
What are you saying?!!

691
01:17:20,134 --> 01:17:21,579
I am well aware of the facts

692
01:17:22,201 --> 01:17:28,379
Will you be okay if I drag a girl by her hand
and coochey coo her child all the time?

693
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:30,572
Are you coming now or not?

694
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:52,610
What happened?

695
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:55,608
That Nila is...

696
01:17:59,834 --> 01:18:02,610
Shall we see Shweta before we leave?

697
01:18:08,501 --> 01:18:12,950
Let's go

698
01:18:24,234 --> 01:18:27,875
it's Krishna, dad
I have seen him in snaps before

699
01:18:28,234 --> 01:18:29,611
Where are you?

700
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:35,147
Will you wait here?
I'll go inside

701
01:18:57,634 --> 01:19:00,615
I'll never call you dinosaur again

702
01:19:08,367 --> 01:19:11,348
Come Nila, let's go home

703
01:19:15,367 --> 01:19:17,210
Nila won't come
You can leave

704
01:19:17,834 --> 01:19:22,078
- Why won't she come?
- She won't

705
01:19:22,167 --> 01:19:24,340
Daddy

706
01:19:24,434 --> 01:19:28,007
- Nila, let's go home
- Dadddddy!

707
01:19:38,967 --> 01:19:40,207
Nila won't come

708
01:19:41,301 --> 01:19:42,405
Get lost

709
01:19:44,634 --> 01:19:48,343
Daddy!

710
01:19:50,767 --> 01:19:51,939
Catch him

711
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:54,743
I'm going home

712
01:19:58,767 --> 01:20:03,079
- Give me the child
- No

713
01:20:19,634 --> 01:20:21,875
Let me go home

714
01:20:21,967 --> 01:20:24,038
Grab him
Give me the child

715
01:20:27,567 --> 01:20:28,602
Let go of Krishna

716
01:20:28,767 --> 01:20:29,939
Give me the child

717
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:39,335
What's happening here?

718
01:20:39,434 --> 01:20:44,406
Are you all uncivilized?
Behave like humane beings!

719
01:20:59,534 --> 01:21:07,112
Bhanu is my daughter
I have searched for her everywhere

720
01:21:09,601 --> 01:21:18,248
I thought she'd be living happily
with the man she loved...somewhere

721
01:21:37,834 --> 01:21:45,685
They acted in haste
I apologize on their behalf

722
01:21:52,567 --> 01:22:01,851
Krishna and Nila are all that
I have left in my daughter's memory

723
01:22:07,434 --> 01:22:09,277
Send them with me

724
01:22:11,234 --> 01:22:14,545
I'll take care of them both

725
01:22:55,167 --> 01:22:56,145
Don't give him money

726
01:22:56,834 --> 01:23:02,113
This is Krishna's money
He earned it rightfully

727
01:23:04,167 --> 01:23:09,412
How can I ever thank you
for all that you've done?

728
01:23:09,501 --> 01:23:18,148
You are not taking with you
just 1 child but 2

729
01:23:38,167 --> 01:23:39,145
Stop the car

730
01:23:50,634 --> 01:23:51,544
Get down

731
01:23:54,101 --> 01:23:55,546
We've reached...get down

732
01:23:59,634 --> 01:24:02,012
I'll hold her for you

733
01:24:12,901 --> 01:24:14,005
Start the car

734
01:24:54,167 --> 01:24:59,742
Only medicine for Krishna is Nila

735
01:25:32,034 --> 01:25:32,876
What are you doing?

736
01:25:36,034 --> 01:25:39,811
Nila will come

737
01:25:40,634 --> 01:25:41,544
Trust me

738
01:25:43,234 --> 01:25:50,413
I'll take Krishna back with me
Admit him in a hospital there

739
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:54,607
incidentally or accidentally I am also
to blame for Krishna's present condition

740
01:25:57,034 --> 01:26:00,743
Re-uniting Krishna and Nila
is my responsibility

741
01:26:01,767 --> 01:26:04,270
I'll take care

742
01:26:09,667 --> 01:26:10,839
Stop here

743
01:26:38,867 --> 01:26:40,039
My client

744
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,141
He'll be here till my case gets over

745
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:47,338
Is this a home or charity hall?

746
01:26:49,034 --> 01:26:49,944
Charity hall

747
01:27:14,767 --> 01:27:17,839
Rajendran, chairman of
Green valley educational trust

748
01:27:17,934 --> 01:27:21,711
Not just in Ooty, he has
14 such institutions all over Tamil Nadu

749
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:24,041
Well known in our society

750
01:27:24,267 --> 01:27:25,644
He has 2 daughters

751
01:27:25,734 --> 01:27:28,578
Bhanumathy the eldest
rebelled against her dad

752
01:27:28,667 --> 01:27:30,578
5 years ago she got married and left home

753
01:27:30,801 --> 01:27:34,248
Youngest daughter Shweta
studied MBA in USA

754
01:27:34,334 --> 01:27:37,178
She is now correspondent
in her dad's school

755
01:27:46,534 --> 01:27:50,175
Sir, someone called Anuradha
has come to see you

756
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,207
Do you need admission?

757
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:02,008
- No, sir
- Do you want any donation?

758
01:28:04,101 --> 01:28:06,274
Fax this immediately

759
01:28:06,634 --> 01:28:09,808
I need to talk to you personally

760
01:28:10,167 --> 01:28:12,272
I'm seeing you for the 1st time now

761
01:28:12,367 --> 01:28:14,005
How can we share anything personal?

762
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:16,010
Who?

763
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:19,473
- Which Bhanu?
- Your eldest daughter

764
01:28:19,967 --> 01:28:22,140
I have just 1 daughter called Shweta

765
01:28:22,234 --> 01:28:23,474
Why are you lying?

766
01:28:23,567 --> 01:28:25,877
There's no necessity for me to lie

767
01:28:25,967 --> 01:28:27,412
Look at me and speak

768
01:28:28,467 --> 01:28:30,504
Nila is with you

769
01:28:31,001 --> 01:28:33,311
There's no one by the name Nila here

770
01:28:45,067 --> 01:28:48,105
Where is Nila?

771
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:53,506
She's up...go

772
01:29:00,267 --> 01:29:01,712
Where are you going?

773
01:29:03,134 --> 01:29:09,346
- Stop, you shouldn't go there
- Nila is there, let me go see her

774
01:29:12,167 --> 01:29:15,148
Who is this?

775
01:29:16,767 --> 01:29:20,613
Stop there

776
01:29:20,701 --> 01:29:23,807
Nila is up

777
01:29:27,434 --> 01:29:30,711
I want my Nila

778
01:29:33,501 --> 01:29:34,605
Take your hands off

779
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:38,279
- Get out from here
- I want my Nila

780
01:29:40,467 --> 01:29:42,037
Don't you dare hit him
Take us to Nila

781
01:29:42,134 --> 01:29:45,115
I am being nice to you
because you are a female

782
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:47,507
I want Nila

783
01:29:47,601 --> 01:29:49,171
Are you deliberately
making trouble for me?

784
01:29:49,267 --> 01:29:50,371
You separated a daughter and dad,

785
01:29:50,467 --> 01:29:52,777
...left him on the roads
and now claim innocence?

786
01:29:52,867 --> 01:29:55,780
Who are you to question me?
How are you connected to him?

787
01:29:56,934 --> 01:29:58,971
I am a lawyer
Krishna is innocent

788
01:29:59,067 --> 01:30:02,514
Then file a case in the court
Don't create a ruckus here

789
01:30:18,567 --> 01:30:19,568
What did you do?

790
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,708
Habeas corpus
Writ petition

791
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:29,574
They have to bring Nila
to the court wherever she may be

792
01:30:29,667 --> 01:30:31,510
Do you know whom
we are crossing swords with?

793
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,773
Can we compete with his money
or man power?

794
01:30:33,867 --> 01:30:35,904
No, we can't
That's why

795
01:30:42,267 --> 01:30:44,645
- Can we meet Mr Rajendran?
- Please take a seat

796
01:30:47,667 --> 01:30:48,771
What are you doing here?

797
01:30:50,067 --> 01:30:51,944
When will my daddy come?

798
01:30:52,034 --> 01:30:54,014
You know he's not well

799
01:30:54,567 --> 01:30:56,205
As soon as he gets better he'll be here

800
01:30:56,301 --> 01:31:00,681
When will he get better?
When will he come?

801
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:06,135
Tomorrow

802
01:31:06,234 --> 01:31:09,613
This is your reply everyday
When will he really come?

803
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:11,608
Tomorrow
Positively

804
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:13,737
Sir, someone has come to see you

805
01:31:14,034 --> 01:31:15,604
This is an order from the High court

806
01:31:15,834 --> 01:31:17,677
We came in person since it concerns YOU!

807
01:31:17,834 --> 01:31:20,075
If you let us know how to handle this

808
01:31:22,834 --> 01:31:24,074
Why are you here?

809
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:29,716
Do you need a lawyer?
I am sorry I cannot oblige

810
01:31:29,801 --> 01:31:31,644
Withdraw the case you are handling now

811
01:31:31,734 --> 01:31:33,645
Why? What happened?

812
01:31:33,734 --> 01:31:35,304
You were prepared to meet me in the court

813
01:31:35,734 --> 01:31:36,712
We'll meet there just as you said

814
01:31:36,801 --> 01:31:39,179
There's no justice
in the case that you are handling

815
01:31:39,267 --> 01:31:40,439
What's justice?

816
01:31:41,334 --> 01:31:44,247
You broke a lovely home
Is that fair?

817
01:31:44,867 --> 01:31:48,041
You separated a dad and his daughter?
Is that right?

818
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:50,910
Do you know the anguish of that affection?

819
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,037
You are asking me about affection?

820
01:31:53,134 --> 01:31:56,513
No one can feel that pain more than me

821
01:32:01,434 --> 01:32:05,610
My eldest daughter
never wanted to get married

822
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:07,737
Social service was her life

823
01:32:08,234 --> 01:32:10,942
When she told me she loved someone

824
01:32:11,034 --> 01:32:12,945
instead of objecting
like most dads would do...

825
01:32:13,034 --> 01:32:15,605
I was the one who with great joy
told her to bring him home

826
01:32:16,901 --> 01:32:19,814
But she brought home a man like him!

827
01:32:19,901 --> 01:32:23,678
No dad in the world would agree

828
01:32:24,034 --> 01:32:30,815
She chose him over my money,
dignity, status, love

829
01:32:31,834 --> 01:32:33,472
Where is she today?

830
01:32:39,667 --> 01:32:43,240
Do you want me to lose Nila too?

831
01:32:46,867 --> 01:32:48,972
You are talking about 1 whose life is over

832
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:50,907
I am talking of those who are still alive

833
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:54,971
- Whomever...
- We'll discuss the rest in court

834
01:32:57,534 --> 01:33:02,313
I did not come here
fearing you or this case

835
01:33:03,134 --> 01:33:08,516
Your case won't hold water
even in Supreme court!

836
01:33:11,934 --> 01:33:15,143
This case is not a cake walk, like you think

837
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:20,412
Law does not support a mentally unstable
parent to bring up his or her child

838
01:33:21,234 --> 01:33:24,408
- I am aware
- Then why do you want to take up this case?

839
01:33:24,501 --> 01:33:28,472
Neither will we win nor get money
On top of it, habeas corpus

840
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:30,545
I've promised Krishna

841
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:33,207
I'd get Nila back for him

842
01:33:34,567 --> 01:33:36,137
I don't know if I'll succeed

843
01:33:38,434 --> 01:33:41,415
At least I should make them meet

844
01:33:42,534 --> 01:33:43,877
Krishna is here

845
01:33:44,034 --> 01:33:50,849
If you tell me where Nila is,
I'll go find her

846
01:33:52,067 --> 01:33:54,638
What are you doing?

847
01:33:54,801 --> 01:33:56,974
I'm talking to my daddy

848
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:05,976
Nila said if I talk to this Nila (moon)
it will be our messenger

849
01:34:06,667 --> 01:34:10,240
- Did you eat?
- No

850
01:34:10,601 --> 01:34:12,103
Come, let's eat

851
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:13,770
When will Nila come?

852
01:34:14,001 --> 01:34:16,106
When will my daddy come?

853
01:34:16,334 --> 01:34:18,507
Tomorrow you can see Nila during the day

854
01:34:34,634 --> 01:34:35,806
What's the time?

855
01:34:36,834 --> 01:34:39,280
As if you'll understand!

856
01:34:40,434 --> 01:34:44,405
Nila will come
I want to see Nila

857
01:34:44,501 --> 01:34:47,141
Even Neil Armstrong who went
to the moon wouldn't be so obsessed!

858
01:34:47,234 --> 01:34:49,407
You've been bugging me from last night

859
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:50,740
Wait, she'll come

860
01:34:52,567 --> 01:34:56,481
What's in the basket?

861
01:34:56,967 --> 01:35:01,313
For Nila
Food, biscuit and sweater

862
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:03,835
Sweater for her too?

863
01:35:11,734 --> 01:35:13,304
Mr Bashyam?!

864
01:35:13,734 --> 01:35:16,305
He can make even a normal guy loony!

865
01:35:20,534 --> 01:35:21,444
Where's the child?

866
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:27,114
It isn't necessary to bring
the child as she is a minor

867
01:35:29,867 --> 01:35:31,107
What do we do now?

868
01:35:32,934 --> 01:35:36,279
You escort Krishna out

869
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:43,309
Come with me

870
01:35:52,534 --> 01:35:56,505
Who is this new kiddo?
I have never seen her before

871
01:35:56,601 --> 01:36:00,640
She used to be a spectator
Now she's a lawyer!

872
01:36:03,667 --> 01:36:09,743
Inspite of habeas corpus
Nila has not been brought to court

873
01:36:09,834 --> 01:36:12,508
This is a disgrace to our law and justice

874
01:36:16,667 --> 01:36:23,710
A pip squeak 2 cases old is questioning
my 20 years experience, My Lord!

875
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:26,440
If it is so funny why should
they be scared to bring the child?

876
01:36:27,534 --> 01:36:29,912
Mr Bashyam, why hasn't
the child been brought to court?

877
01:36:31,401 --> 01:36:34,644
My client Mr Rajendran
is the child's legal guardian

878
01:36:34,934 --> 01:36:40,646
According to section #7
I submit this petition

879
01:36:45,867 --> 01:36:48,074
When the child's biological father is alive,

880
01:36:48,167 --> 01:36:50,010
how can someone else be her legal guardian?

881
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:53,081
It's true her father exists
But in what state?

882
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:56,474
What's wrong with him?
He is fine

883
01:36:57,634 --> 01:36:59,944
The child's father is mentally retarded

884
01:37:01,034 --> 01:37:02,206
Who told you that?

885
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:03,335
Who needs to tell?

886
01:37:03,434 --> 01:37:05,675
Have you seen him?
Do you have any proof?

887
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:18,479
He not only disrespects the court
but also my petitioner

888
01:37:18,634 --> 01:37:22,707
My petitioner Mr Krishna
is just like one of us

889
01:37:22,867 --> 01:37:27,111
He runs a chocolate factory in Ooty

890
01:37:27,467 --> 01:37:31,040
I object strongly to my client
being falsely accused

891
01:37:37,734 --> 01:37:42,012
Not sufficient if you grow tall enough
to hit your head in the front porch!

892
01:37:42,667 --> 01:37:45,375
The way you piled on objections
I almost got a heart attack

893
01:37:45,467 --> 01:37:50,780
Think back to the times we waited endlessly
to apprentice as Bashyam's junior?

894
01:37:50,867 --> 01:37:53,575
Like Vino said, he'll make
a normal person go nuts!

895
01:37:53,667 --> 01:37:56,307
If they see Krishna
our case goes for a toss!

896
01:37:56,400 --> 01:38:01,679
- Will Nila come there?
- This is enough!

897
01:38:01,767 --> 01:38:03,144
It wasn't deliberately said

898
01:38:03,334 --> 01:38:05,575
That's what I could think of
at that spur of the moment

899
01:38:05,701 --> 01:38:08,580
You could have asked for an adjournment
claiming your tummy was cart wheeling!

900
01:38:08,667 --> 01:38:09,737
You've stated the impossible

901
01:38:10,034 --> 01:38:14,483
Shall we get a certificate
from the doctor that Anu is unstable?!

902
01:38:14,567 --> 01:38:16,012
I can't think of any other

903
01:38:16,167 --> 01:38:17,578
There's a way if you are willing

904
01:38:37,667 --> 01:38:39,647
You sent a message to him from her number?

905
01:38:39,867 --> 01:38:40,902
With a kiss emoticon

906
01:38:44,801 --> 01:38:48,442
I've been waiting
from our college days for this

907
01:38:50,267 --> 01:38:53,248
My job's gone

908
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:58,177
Anu told me not to work with her

909
01:38:58,401 --> 01:39:01,848
I've been warning you
from college days not to befriend her

910
01:39:01,934 --> 01:39:03,709
She's as useless as a pumpkin

911
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:07,106
Come with me right now
I'll ask Bashyam to take you as his junior

912
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:09,476
I have a lot of clout there

913
01:39:10,900 --> 01:39:14,347
Mr Bashyam doesn't even know his name
Snooty scoundrel

914
01:39:14,434 --> 01:39:15,674
Let me plaster his face with sand

915
01:39:18,634 --> 01:39:19,408
What happened?

916
01:39:23,900 --> 01:39:26,540
I can't leave Anu

917
01:39:26,834 --> 01:39:27,938
Why?

918
01:39:28,100 --> 01:39:31,138
She hasn't paid me for 5 months

919
01:39:32,567 --> 01:39:37,744
Unless we win Nila's case
I won't get my salary

920
01:39:38,867 --> 01:39:41,746
it's my responsibility to help you

921
01:39:41,834 --> 01:39:46,146
We will win

922
01:39:51,067 --> 01:39:53,707
if Krishna is mentally challenged
as you claim...

923
01:39:54,801 --> 01:39:56,246
...they can't go beyond the 1st hearing

924
01:39:56,334 --> 01:39:58,245
I don't claim
It is a fact

925
01:40:01,667 --> 01:40:03,578
it's tough to convert truth into a lie

926
01:40:03,734 --> 01:40:05,111
it's easy to make truth out of truth

927
01:40:14,901 --> 01:40:16,005
Where's Krishna?

928
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:19,281
Am I the watchman of this house
to check who is in and who is out?

929
01:40:19,367 --> 01:40:20,778
Is anyone asking me permission to live here?

930
01:40:27,601 --> 01:40:32,050
I told you, he'd be here

931
01:40:38,967 --> 01:40:40,071
What are you doing here?

932
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:45,014
Isn't Nila here?

933
01:40:46,301 --> 01:40:47,746
Case is still not over

934
01:40:48,367 --> 01:40:51,814
If anyone sees you here now
you will never get Nila

935
01:40:56,067 --> 01:40:58,673
I shouldn't come here?

936
01:40:58,767 --> 01:41:00,337
Do you want Nila or not?

937
01:41:03,767 --> 01:41:05,804
You cannot come here without my knowledge

938
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:13,212
I won't come here after

939
01:41:22,334 --> 01:41:24,439
Won't just 'on the way' do?
Why add a suffix 'dear'?

940
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:27,770
I can't stand him

941
01:41:32,367 --> 01:41:33,141
What happened?

942
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:36,343
So long to remove a sweater?

943
01:41:37,234 --> 01:41:39,407
I've been trying for past
2 hours to remove it

944
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:42,572
He's holding on to it like
it's an appendage to his body!

945
01:41:42,667 --> 01:41:43,645
1 last try

946
01:42:06,867 --> 01:42:10,246
Only his brain is weak
Rest of his body is strong as an ox

947
01:42:15,667 --> 01:42:18,307
I am such a lion king
I couldn't accomplish it

948
01:42:19,533 --> 01:42:20,568
Go man

949
01:42:22,134 --> 01:42:24,580
lama lion king

950
01:42:45,534 --> 01:42:49,209
- My name is Kris
- Don't lift your hand

951
01:42:49,301 --> 01:42:52,942
My name is Krishna,Avalanchi, Ooty
Repeat that

952
01:42:57,434 --> 01:43:00,142
You think you are a composer
conducting a concert?

953
01:43:00,234 --> 01:43:03,010
So much fuss to pronounce
such a simple name as Krishna!

954
01:43:04,701 --> 01:43:06,203
This is our first test

955
01:43:06,301 --> 01:43:11,250
If we convince the examining doctor
rest of it is a cake walk

956
01:43:12,734 --> 01:43:15,180
You are way too optimistic!

957
01:43:20,901 --> 01:43:27,750
A normal man should have an IQ above 90

958
01:43:27,834 --> 01:43:32,374
Anything less than that
is considered mentally challenged

959
01:43:32,468 --> 01:43:40,353
So Krishna should get
90+ in tomorrow's IQ test

960
01:43:46,434 --> 01:43:50,280
Can't you give us the questions before hand?

961
01:44:13,367 --> 01:44:14,846
Tomorrow's certificate?

962
01:44:14,934 --> 01:44:18,245
We should never lie to a doctor or a lawyer

963
01:44:18,334 --> 01:44:21,577
But a doctor or lawyer can lie!

964
01:44:32,101 --> 01:44:32,875
Who is the person?

965
01:44:32,967 --> 01:44:33,945
He is seated over there

966
01:44:37,867 --> 01:44:39,904
Give me 5 minutes time
I'll get organized and then call you

967
01:44:40,534 --> 01:44:41,808
Go and get his details

968
01:44:42,267 --> 01:44:43,439
Tell me your details

969
01:44:46,267 --> 01:44:48,110
Who is the one who came now?

970
01:44:50,401 --> 01:44:52,438
Dr Basheer who will conduct the IQ test now

971
01:44:53,067 --> 01:44:54,978
What about Dr Ramana Rao?

972
01:44:55,067 --> 01:44:58,810
He's flat after drinking
some liquor doled out last night

973
01:44:58,901 --> 01:44:59,971
Today he is attending all cases

974
01:45:04,434 --> 01:45:05,378
What can I do?

975
01:45:05,467 --> 01:45:07,572
You arranged everything
You have to set right this mess

976
01:45:07,667 --> 01:45:09,704
Serves me right to have helped you!
Find someone else

977
01:45:17,534 --> 01:45:20,378
Can we bribe the new doc?

978
01:45:20,567 --> 01:45:22,740
- That's the hassle
- Why?

979
01:45:23,167 --> 01:45:27,081
He cannot be tempted
He is very straight forward

980
01:45:28,101 --> 01:45:29,478
Any other...

981
01:45:29,567 --> 01:45:35,609
He loves his wife dearly
Just like us!

982
01:45:35,701 --> 01:45:36,941
Then you have to surrender

983
01:45:42,267 --> 01:45:43,211
Who are you?

984
01:45:43,767 --> 01:45:46,748
- Mr Bashyam's junior
- He sent me

985
01:45:49,767 --> 01:45:50,677
What are you doing?

986
01:45:50,767 --> 01:45:52,610
Mr Bashyam asked me to give you

987
01:45:52,701 --> 01:45:55,739
Give what? What's the matter?

988
01:45:57,634 --> 01:46:02,276
Krishna, a patient will have his IQ tested

989
01:46:02,367 --> 01:46:06,679
You should certify him as mentally challenged
with IQ level below 50

990
01:46:06,934 --> 01:46:08,641
That's why I was sent

991
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:11,976
You think you can buy me with your money?

992
01:46:12,067 --> 01:46:13,978
Do you know who I am?

993
01:46:14,067 --> 01:46:15,512
Whom do you think you are talking to?

994
01:46:15,734 --> 01:46:17,077
Hey! Who let him in?

995
01:46:17,501 --> 01:46:19,481
How dare he pretend to be righteous?

996
01:46:19,567 --> 01:46:21,478
If my boss gets to know this...

997
01:46:21,567 --> 01:46:24,480
This is Mr Bashyam's case
Don't get stressed out

998
01:46:24,567 --> 01:46:27,514
If you don't oblige you'll be in a soup

999
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:30,308
Are you working for the Government or them?

1000
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:31,640
I'll bash you!

1001
01:46:31,734 --> 01:46:34,715
Will you give me the certificate
or shall I write it myself?

1002
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:38,304
- I dare you to do it
- Will you meet Mr Bashyam?

1003
01:46:38,401 --> 01:46:42,247
Who the hell is Bashyam?
Get up

1004
01:46:44,134 --> 01:46:47,377
I am not a puppet on a string
for Bashyam to play with?!

1005
01:47:04,467 --> 01:47:09,507
Learned advocate has fraudulently
submitted a forged document

1006
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:15,346
It is ridiculous that...

1007
01:47:15,434 --> 01:47:19,007
...a lawyer with 20 years of experience
claims a govt. document to be forged

1008
01:47:22,967 --> 01:47:25,470
If that be the case,
last year on February 7th

1009
01:47:25,567 --> 01:47:27,945
...he produced a document
in the divorce case of Kumar and Sandhya

1010
01:47:28,034 --> 01:47:31,140
It proclaimed Sandhya to be mentally ill

1011
01:47:31,234 --> 01:47:32,713
Is that a fake document?

1012
01:47:39,301 --> 01:47:42,942
In 2008, he proclaimed
Arul Murthy as mentally ill

1013
01:47:43,034 --> 01:47:46,413
in a drunken driving case,
involving 4 people

1014
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:47,774
Is that a forged document?

1015
01:47:51,667 --> 01:47:52,577
This is the proof

1016
01:47:55,967 --> 01:47:59,608
Oh! She beat her teacher hollow!

1017
01:48:00,567 --> 01:48:03,446
This is the twist in our tale!

1018
01:48:05,134 --> 01:48:07,978
If he agrees to have
those cases take an IQ test

1019
01:48:08,334 --> 01:48:10,575
I'll agree to have my client tested

1020
01:48:18,234 --> 01:48:20,077
Her document can be accepted

1021
01:48:24,167 --> 01:48:26,204
My petitioner is a good father

1022
01:48:26,567 --> 01:48:29,070
He has brought up Nila
for 5 years with tender loving care

1023
01:48:29,167 --> 01:48:30,544
He is traumatized now

1024
01:48:31,434 --> 01:48:35,610
I humbly request this
IQ report be considered

1025
01:48:35,701 --> 01:48:40,081
as enough evidence
to unite Nila and Krishna

1026
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:44,879
Since the case is still in court,

1027
01:48:44,967 --> 01:48:49,143
either in a common place
or court premises

1028
01:48:49,234 --> 01:48:52,613
I allow Krishna to meet
his daughter on Friday for an hour

1029
01:48:58,967 --> 01:49:01,914
If Nila comes to court
it will be a big fiasco

1030
01:49:02,667 --> 01:49:07,241
It will not be an obstacle for us
It will be a debacle for them

1031
01:49:08,467 --> 01:49:11,710
As long as Krishna is hidden they win

1032
01:49:12,334 --> 01:49:14,473
If Krishna comes to court they lose

1033
01:49:15,434 --> 01:49:17,471
Their reunion is advantageous to us

1034
01:49:18,501 --> 01:49:19,741
What if Nila meets Krishna?

1035
01:49:19,834 --> 01:49:23,646
Nila will come to court
But she won't meet Krishna

1036
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:28,307
Krishna has to face me and this world

1037
01:49:33,934 --> 01:49:35,174
What are you doing?

1038
01:49:39,401 --> 01:49:43,247
Nila loves rice mixed with milk

1039
01:49:46,767 --> 01:49:48,405
Nila is really blessed

1040
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:51,838
to get a dad like you

1041
01:49:53,134 --> 01:49:55,045
I am a good dad?!

1042
01:50:13,101 --> 01:50:14,011
What's happening?

1043
01:50:15,700 --> 01:50:18,681
Mr Bashyam is here
They have come with the child

1044
01:50:19,634 --> 01:50:21,136
Waiting to meet Krishna

1045
01:50:21,567 --> 01:50:23,342
I'll be there

1046
01:50:30,168 --> 01:50:32,671
- How much longer?
- We'll be there soon

1047
01:50:33,834 --> 01:50:36,280
Looks like an accident
Let me go check

1048
01:50:36,767 --> 01:50:39,805
How recklessly you drove!

1049
01:50:59,067 --> 01:51:02,879
It's Mr Bashyam's men
who are creating the traffic jam

1050
01:51:04,567 --> 01:51:06,012
I'll bring Krishna

1051
01:51:07,701 --> 01:51:09,544
- Come
- Come

1052
01:51:11,568 --> 01:51:12,842
No, this side

1053
01:51:18,867 --> 01:51:20,540
We are going to see Nila

1054
01:51:21,434 --> 01:51:23,812
- Do you want any food?
- I don't want

1055
01:51:23,901 --> 01:51:26,472
- Call Anu, quick
- Muruga, look over there

1056
01:51:28,101 --> 01:51:33,744
Anu, bring Krishna to the car park
without Mr Bashyam's knowledge

1057
01:51:34,134 --> 01:51:35,511
I am Murugan speaking

1058
01:51:35,600 --> 01:51:38,547
Krishna and his lawyer are coming
to the car park to see Nila

1059
01:51:38,767 --> 01:51:40,144
Her assistant is here

1060
01:51:44,634 --> 01:51:45,669
We have 2 more minutes

1061
01:51:58,667 --> 01:51:59,839
Come soon

1062
01:52:07,934 --> 01:52:09,311
it's getting late

1063
01:52:11,134 --> 01:52:12,238
Nila will leave

1064
01:52:13,967 --> 01:52:15,002
What are you doing?

1065
01:52:27,267 --> 01:52:28,507
Let's go

1066
01:52:38,401 --> 01:52:40,347
They are heading towards
the car park to see Nila

1067
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:46,212
Relax! I'll take care
Escort him to the car park

1068
01:52:58,734 --> 01:53:00,441
Anu, why are you so late?

1069
01:53:01,001 --> 01:53:02,674
- Where's Nila?
- They just took her this way

1070
01:53:02,767 --> 01:53:03,745
Where have they gone?

1071
01:53:05,434 --> 01:53:08,278
- Where is Mr Bashyam?
- As per our plan, Krishna...

1072
01:53:15,634 --> 01:53:17,614
- Where are they?
- They were here just now

1073
01:54:06,700 --> 01:54:08,179
Krishna is at the rear entrance

1074
01:54:34,434 --> 01:54:37,313
You came to relieve yourself
But didn't go in

1075
01:54:38,401 --> 01:54:40,779
Yeah! I came to relieve myself
But it can wait

1076
01:54:45,601 --> 01:54:49,447
I didn't intend to
But I can't hold on for long

1077
01:55:03,167 --> 01:55:04,271
Mr Bashyam?

1078
01:55:05,567 --> 01:55:08,138
I am Murthy, Avalanchi

1079
01:55:08,234 --> 01:55:09,804
- We spoke over the phone
- Tell me

1080
01:55:09,901 --> 01:55:12,609
As per your request
I've brought Krishna's friends

1081
01:55:12,700 --> 01:55:14,304
They are all as loony as him

1082
01:55:14,400 --> 01:55:17,176
If you take them to court,
you'll come thumbs up!

1083
01:55:17,267 --> 01:55:22,649
Judge will finish this case
in favoring a jiffy!

1084
01:55:24,934 --> 01:55:27,505
Be ready at 9:00 A.NI tomorrow
I'll send a car

1085
01:55:31,534 --> 01:55:34,310
For no reason should anyone
step out of the room

1086
01:55:37,368 --> 01:55:40,941
That Bashyam has an extra
long nose and brain

1087
01:55:41,034 --> 01:55:44,538
I knew he'd do something crooked like this

1088
01:55:48,434 --> 01:55:51,847
We should somehow
convince Murthy before day break

1089
01:55:53,134 --> 01:55:55,705
Can we call the hotel
and find out the room #?

1090
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:59,805
Room may not be booked in their names

1091
01:56:00,100 --> 01:56:02,546
Do you expect us to knock on all doors!?!

1092
01:56:03,767 --> 01:56:04,871
Just 1 clue

1093
01:56:06,167 --> 01:56:09,478
All floors are occupied by tennis players

1094
01:56:09,567 --> 01:56:12,013
Others have been allotted rooms
only in the 4th floor

1095
01:56:12,100 --> 01:56:15,081
So we need to check only the 4th floor

1096
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:27,017
Whoever recognizes Krishna
and vice versa they are 'them'!

1097
01:56:27,101 --> 01:56:29,206
- 'They' are who?
- 'Them'!

1098
01:56:36,201 --> 01:56:37,271
What do you want?

1099
01:56:39,034 --> 01:56:40,741
Why do you keep repeating?

1100
01:56:40,834 --> 01:56:43,440
Why are you hassled hearing it just twice?

1101
01:56:43,534 --> 01:56:46,037
We've heard it 2000 times! Be patient

1102
01:56:51,534 --> 01:56:58,281
When the next door opens
just check if your friends are in

1103
01:56:59,367 --> 01:57:00,471
Don't ask for Nila

1104
01:57:04,201 --> 01:57:05,043
Who the hell are you?

1105
01:57:05,134 --> 01:57:06,670
Why do you knock
at such an unearthly hour?

1106
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:08,638
What are you gaping at?
Didn't you knock at my door?

1107
01:57:10,201 --> 01:57:11,839
Then, who did?

1108
01:57:17,067 --> 01:57:19,240
Not Anu, he did

1109
01:57:19,334 --> 01:57:20,972
Didn't you knock?
He's asking for you

1110
01:57:21,600 --> 01:57:23,910
Why did you disturb me
at this time of night for?

1111
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:27,070
- Moon
- What?

1112
01:57:29,034 --> 01:57:30,536
Little...

1113
01:57:30,634 --> 01:57:32,341
Is that so?

1114
01:57:32,867 --> 01:57:37,179
That's why...let him go...poor guy

1115
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:41,970
Take good care of him

1116
01:57:43,134 --> 01:57:45,978
You should not mention Nila's name
Anu, tell him

1117
01:57:46,067 --> 01:57:47,603
What's happening here?

1118
01:57:48,900 --> 01:57:51,141
- I didn't know how to tackle that guy
- Let's ask this waiter

1119
01:57:55,700 --> 01:57:57,941
Don't be stupid
What if it boomerangs on us?

1120
01:57:58,034 --> 01:58:01,948
Mr Sweater won't tell,
we don't know the room

1121
01:58:02,034 --> 01:58:04,537
I shouldn't ask the waiter,
you'll call me a nut-case

1122
01:58:04,634 --> 01:58:06,136
Do you think I can be used and thrown?

1123
01:58:06,234 --> 01:58:07,941
Search all you want without me

1124
01:58:10,167 --> 01:58:13,341
We don't need Vino
Let's go

1125
01:58:26,434 --> 01:58:29,278
Is it an IPL cricket match for me
to give a constant update?

1126
01:58:29,367 --> 01:58:33,338
We have to hunt for loonies
Very soon I'll go mad

1127
01:58:35,267 --> 01:58:36,712
Sit down

1128
01:58:42,134 --> 01:58:47,413
Something is fishy
Let's leave

1129
01:58:55,934 --> 01:58:58,437
Bashyam has kept them hidden somewhere

1130
01:58:58,534 --> 01:59:02,573
If only I catch them I'll squeeze them dry

1131
01:59:02,667 --> 01:59:04,203
Wrong place to talk over the phone

1132
01:59:06,167 --> 01:59:09,011
Giant robots are besieging me

1133
01:59:10,034 --> 01:59:11,411
Where are these 2?

1134
01:59:15,267 --> 01:59:18,714
Did you see 2 people kind-of-loony?

1135
01:59:19,201 --> 01:59:20,544
Not that side

1136
01:59:21,368 --> 01:59:22,472
Where did they go?

1137
01:59:36,434 --> 01:59:39,244
Why were you standing in the corridor
if you came to see a guest?

1138
01:59:39,334 --> 01:59:42,577
Not me...she...

1139
01:59:43,334 --> 01:59:46,042
We forgot the room #

1140
01:59:46,134 --> 01:59:47,511
You could have enquired at the reception

1141
01:59:56,768 --> 01:59:58,338
We came to see him

1142
01:59:59,734 --> 02:00:00,576
He's gone

1143
02:00:15,401 --> 02:00:25,118
Did you see a slightly loony guy
walking this way with a lady?

1144
02:00:27,167 --> 02:00:29,147
Stop hassling me!

1145
02:00:41,867 --> 02:00:45,405
Did you see a slightly loony guy
walking this way?

1146
02:00:46,634 --> 02:00:50,275
God knows where they have gone!

1147
02:00:51,767 --> 02:00:54,077
Looks like our Murthy

1148
02:00:54,167 --> 02:00:57,808
Why are you here?
Where are the other 2?

1149
02:00:57,900 --> 02:01:00,141
Pink cotton candy

1150
02:01:02,367 --> 02:01:06,941
Murthy, Big eye Jo, Karthi

1151
02:01:22,101 --> 02:01:24,604
Where are you?
How long will I hunt for you?

1152
02:01:24,700 --> 02:01:27,647
Murthy's going up

1153
02:01:31,401 --> 02:01:33,904
There's no one by the name Murthy here

1154
02:01:34,001 --> 02:01:35,571
What were you doing in the corridor?

1155
02:01:35,667 --> 02:01:37,169
Tell me the truth

1156
02:01:37,334 --> 02:01:39,780
UP
Down

1157
02:01:40,334 --> 02:01:42,336
He's in the lift

1158
02:01:45,634 --> 02:01:47,477
He's in the 4th floor

1159
02:01:47,567 --> 02:01:49,171
Checked shirt
Buck teeth

1160
02:01:49,267 --> 02:01:53,374
- He's Murthy
- He's going into the room

1161
02:02:03,001 --> 02:02:10,317
He's gone into the room
He has shut the door

1162
02:02:10,601 --> 02:02:13,081
Where did you all go?
Where are the other 2?

1163
02:02:17,834 --> 02:02:21,372
There are 2 people here
claiming to be your guests

1164
02:02:21,467 --> 02:02:23,913
- Yes...yes, sir
- Your guests?

1165
02:02:24,001 --> 02:02:25,105
They are my guests

1166
02:02:25,201 --> 02:02:27,442
They are of unsound mind

1167
02:02:28,668 --> 02:02:31,911
Keep them with you

1168
02:02:36,034 --> 02:02:39,277
Don't open the door whoever knocks

1169
02:02:40,700 --> 02:02:43,806
Turn right

1170
02:02:50,900 --> 02:02:54,109
Checked shirt
Buck teeth

1171
02:03:10,234 --> 02:03:13,647
He's forecasting a weather report
for a rain that won't shower!

1172
02:03:21,467 --> 02:03:23,640
You said they won't come
Who is that?

1173
02:03:28,001 --> 02:03:29,947
- I told him
- Whom did you tell?

1174
02:03:30,034 --> 02:03:34,608
Murthy, let them tell
only what they have been tutored

1175
02:03:34,701 --> 02:03:38,148
Damn! This JCB toothed guy is Murthy

1176
02:03:38,234 --> 02:03:39,941
Not that shovel mouthed smarty!

1177
02:03:40,768 --> 02:03:44,011
What do we do now?

1178
02:03:46,100 --> 02:03:47,408
Do you know Krishna?

1179
02:03:47,501 --> 02:03:50,175
Oh yeah! Krishna is my friend

1180
02:03:50,267 --> 02:03:54,773
We...Nila...foot ball ground

1181
02:03:54,868 --> 02:03:57,371
...we bought pink colored shoes for her

1182
02:04:03,401 --> 02:04:08,407
The whole truth and nothing but the truth

1183
02:04:12,234 --> 02:04:15,545
After nodding his head
like a buffalo he's tongue-tied now

1184
02:04:19,700 --> 02:04:21,680
The whole truth...

1185
02:04:21,900 --> 02:04:24,938
Truth? Why?

1186
02:04:25,034 --> 02:04:26,308
What's this book?

1187
02:04:26,734 --> 02:04:30,705
Give the book back to me

1188
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:35,374
I can't swear, go away

1189
02:04:36,668 --> 02:04:40,946
- I swear...
- I swear

1190
02:04:44,167 --> 02:04:48,013
I swear

1191
02:04:51,967 --> 02:04:53,810
All these witnesses are Krishna's friends

1192
02:04:54,034 --> 02:04:58,414
From 1986 to 2005 they were together
in Kotagiri institute for mental health

1193
02:04:58,500 --> 02:05:03,279
Required evidence
for that is on page #13

1194
02:05:06,634 --> 02:05:10,980
What other evidence is needed
to confirm Krishna's mental instability?

1195
02:05:13,400 --> 02:05:18,816
Those who befriend mentally challenged people
need not themselves be mentally unstable!

1196
02:05:19,267 --> 02:05:25,980
Our learned counsel is unaware that evidence
by these witnesses is null and void

1197
02:05:27,001 --> 02:05:28,446
It surprises me

1198
02:05:33,734 --> 02:05:36,180
Will you accept evidence
by my witness who is of sound mind?

1199
02:05:36,334 --> 02:05:38,371
He is a friend of these
mentally challenged witnesses

1200
02:05:45,701 --> 02:05:48,545
I swear the whole truth
and nothing but the truth

1201
02:05:49,400 --> 02:05:50,970
Is Krishna your employer?

1202
02:05:51,067 --> 02:05:57,382
Krishna is a helper
Our manager is Victor

1203
02:05:58,334 --> 02:05:59,574
Describe Krishna

1204
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,379
Krishna is like a child

1205
02:06:03,467 --> 02:06:06,914
- Which means?
- A little...

1206
02:06:07,534 --> 02:06:10,572
- Of unsound mind
- Yes

1207
02:06:14,667 --> 02:06:19,741
- Wow! Bashyam is amazing!
- Curtain fall for all

1208
02:06:19,967 --> 02:06:23,176
- Do you know Bhanumathi?
- Very well

1209
02:06:23,334 --> 02:06:28,841
Poor girl! She married this Krishna
Died prematurely in child birth

1210
02:06:29,534 --> 02:06:32,640
For God's sake don't give custody
of the child to Krishna

1211
02:06:32,734 --> 02:06:34,771
Nila's life will also be an unholy mess!

1212
02:06:37,067 --> 02:06:38,705
Mr Murthy, you can leave now

1213
02:06:41,134 --> 02:06:43,512
How can you so flippantly ask me to go?

1214
02:06:43,601 --> 02:06:47,777
Mr Bashyam has spent
so much to bring us here

1215
02:06:47,867 --> 02:06:50,643
How can I go without a word to him?

1216
02:06:51,267 --> 02:06:53,440
He taught me word by word what to say

1217
02:06:53,534 --> 02:06:55,275
I hope I did full justice!

1218
02:06:55,434 --> 02:06:57,710
Wow! Bashyam is like Pandora's box!

1219
02:06:57,801 --> 02:07:01,578
He made even normal people act abnormal!

1220
02:07:01,667 --> 02:07:04,170
I hope I didn't forget any important dialog!

1221
02:07:05,867 --> 02:07:07,312
I don't understand

1222
02:07:08,001 --> 02:07:09,708
Leave this place right now

1223
02:07:09,801 --> 02:07:12,714
He has given me permission to go

1224
02:07:56,801 --> 02:08:01,648
Life is a battle field
with its struggle and suffering

1225
02:08:06,434 --> 02:08:11,179
An anthem let us unite to sing

1226
02:08:11,301 --> 02:08:13,406
Wearied feet may weep in misery

1227
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:15,876
Unslept eyes may eclipse unwillingly

1228
02:08:15,968 --> 02:08:20,713
Though it is dark and dreary
let us fight

1229
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:25,408
Just round the next bend
sun will radiate its light

1230
02:08:25,601 --> 02:08:28,582
Dream will come true definitely

1231
02:08:28,667 --> 02:08:30,613
Are you pushing the child?

1232
02:08:30,801 --> 02:08:32,508
Who are you?
Get out

1233
02:08:32,601 --> 02:08:34,808
Why are you standing here?
Get out

1234
02:08:35,034 --> 02:08:36,604
Where is the watchman?

1235
02:08:37,034 --> 02:08:39,810
What are you doing in this play ground?

1236
02:08:41,568 --> 02:08:42,512
Stop it!

1237
02:08:42,967 --> 02:08:47,973
Are you a genius?
Most of you will fail the IQ test

1238
02:08:48,167 --> 02:08:51,080
Shall I tell what's going on, in your homes?

1239
02:08:51,334 --> 02:08:53,905
Don't make me wash
your dirty linen in public!

1240
02:09:49,067 --> 02:09:50,410
Don't we have a life of our own?

1241
02:09:50,501 --> 02:09:52,139
Is Nila going to stay with us?

1242
02:09:53,767 --> 02:09:54,802
Then...?

1243
02:09:56,300 --> 02:09:59,645
After we are married, you'll be with me
Why are you obsessed with Nila?

1244
02:09:59,800 --> 02:10:01,939
Won't she be with us?

1245
02:10:05,601 --> 02:10:11,745
Your dad will take care of her
Or else there are plenty of 'homes'

1246
02:10:12,868 --> 02:10:14,279
I'll take care of the expenses

1247
02:10:17,534 --> 02:10:22,074
My sister was more of a mother to me
than my own mom...for her child...

1248
02:10:23,901 --> 02:10:29,317
I'm not sure if you will be in my life
but there's no life for me without Nila

1249
02:10:31,567 --> 02:10:36,175
There is no path on earth
that we cannot follow

1250
02:10:36,368 --> 02:10:40,942
Rivers don't stop to flow
fearing cavities hollow

1251
02:10:41,134 --> 02:10:45,844
There is not a single day
when the sun does not smile in the sky

1252
02:10:45,934 --> 02:10:50,349
A heart can never sink
with the downpour from the eye!

1253
02:10:50,467 --> 02:10:55,075
House of God has a holy faade
with idol inside

1254
02:10:55,267 --> 02:10:59,943
More sacred are golden hearts
where He will surely reside

1255
02:11:00,034 --> 02:11:04,710
You are the epitome of motherhood
of tender loving care

1256
02:11:04,834 --> 02:11:09,544
Truest heart, no one can compare

1257
02:11:09,667 --> 02:11:11,806
Wearied feet may weep in misery

1258
02:11:12,034 --> 02:11:14,275
Unslept eyes may eclipse unwillingly

1259
02:11:14,434 --> 02:11:19,076
Though it is dark and dreary
let us fight

1260
02:11:19,234 --> 02:11:23,876
Just round the next bend
sun will radiate its light

1261
02:11:24,034 --> 02:11:29,211
Dream will come true definitely

1262
02:11:45,434 --> 02:11:47,471
Krishna is of sound mind

1263
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:55,144
But why is he not coming here?

1264
02:11:59,467 --> 02:12:02,107
It's not essential that petitioner
has to attend when it's a civil proceeding

1265
02:12:02,300 --> 02:12:09,775
He should be here when the defense
lawyer needs to cross examine him

1266
02:12:13,067 --> 02:12:16,947
At the same time you should know
what the child's preference is

1267
02:12:17,500 --> 02:12:18,638
Nila should also be here

1268
02:12:18,701 --> 02:12:22,410
- To bring a child to court is...
- Produce the child in court

1269
02:12:29,301 --> 02:12:30,439
We are all here

1270
02:12:36,300 --> 02:12:38,371
They might have had a narrow escape so far

1271
02:12:38,467 --> 02:12:45,612
Everyone backing him up must
answer my questions...not just Krishna!!

1272
02:12:54,101 --> 02:12:56,081
What we achieved so far is no big deal

1273
02:12:56,467 --> 02:12:58,310
Tomorrow is the D'day for us!

1274
02:12:59,234 --> 02:13:03,478
If they ever find out we lied
we'll be minus our lawyer robes!

1275
02:13:03,834 --> 02:13:06,974
Even we can't face
Mr Bashyam's cross examination

1276
02:13:07,100 --> 02:13:08,306
Imagine Krishna's plight

1277
02:13:08,434 --> 02:13:11,608
I don't think it's a good idea
to show Krishna in court tomorrow

1278
02:13:11,700 --> 02:13:12,610
I know

1279
02:14:02,767 --> 02:14:03,905
Daddy

1280
02:14:12,767 --> 02:14:16,647
Thunder...scared

1281
02:15:42,101 --> 02:15:46,277
I see a colored curve in your eyes

1282
02:15:46,567 --> 02:15:50,640
...that flirts with my eye lids new

1283
02:15:50,900 --> 02:15:54,347
What report is it weather-wise?

1284
02:15:54,534 --> 02:15:58,277
Hand in hand a sun and rain view

1285
02:15:58,367 --> 02:16:00,870
Within you...l see

1286
02:16:01,100 --> 02:16:03,137
I perceive

1287
02:16:03,300 --> 02:16:07,009
my love...my mother in you!

1288
02:16:07,167 --> 02:16:09,704
I taste defeat, dear

1289
02:16:09,834 --> 02:16:11,871
I lose...in toto

1290
02:16:12,067 --> 02:16:15,514
Whatever will happen here?

1291
02:16:15,734 --> 02:16:24,620
I am in a trance...sheer novelty

1292
02:16:25,301 --> 02:16:29,511
To my soul... you zoomed in as a mirror

1293
02:16:29,700 --> 02:16:34,012
You introduced myself to me

1294
02:16:34,134 --> 02:16:38,947
To my dreams...my sole answer

1295
02:16:41,601 --> 02:16:45,674
In your eyes I see a rainbow

1296
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:50,176
that touches my eye lids aglow

1297
02:16:50,401 --> 02:16:53,814
What is this new climate?

1298
02:16:53,968 --> 02:16:58,576
Sun as rain's soul mate!

1299
02:17:47,101 --> 02:17:51,208
You breezed into my life out of the blue

1300
02:17:51,434 --> 02:17:55,541
Head to toe you bloomed in me anew

1301
02:17:55,900 --> 02:17:59,814
Maybe tomorrow you may part from me

1302
02:18:00,001 --> 02:18:04,313
You'll be a part of my memory

1303
02:18:04,400 --> 02:18:11,716
Don't you see...street gets lonely
after the chariot passes by

1304
02:18:12,667 --> 02:18:20,984
You baited me with your charm
I fell hook line and sinker!

1305
02:18:21,401 --> 02:18:29,912
Finally now because of you
l realize my femininity

1306
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:39,318
I falter..waven..flutten..linger

1307
02:18:39,601 --> 02:18:48,180
My heart doesn't listen to me any longer

1308
02:18:48,434 --> 02:18:53,110
It criss-crosses into your path, my dear

1309
02:19:24,867 --> 02:19:26,938
Don't worry...just a sprain

1310
02:19:27,067 --> 02:19:29,308
I've applied this ointment
She'll be fine tomorrow

1311
02:19:29,668 --> 02:19:30,806
Please go sleep

1312
02:19:33,700 --> 02:19:35,111
Don't get worked up

1313
02:19:35,300 --> 02:19:36,176
Go to bed

1314
02:19:40,034 --> 02:19:41,445
I want to see my daddy

1315
02:19:42,034 --> 02:19:43,570
But your dad is not well

1316
02:19:43,834 --> 02:19:45,677
Why are you lying to me?

1317
02:19:46,934 --> 02:19:48,504
My daddy is here

1318
02:19:48,700 --> 02:19:52,170
Aren't we here for you?
Don't you like me?

1319
02:19:52,333 --> 02:19:56,975
You are with your dad
Can't I be with mine?

1320
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:05,808
You called for me?

1321
02:20:19,334 --> 02:20:23,111
I was wondering
how my framework got rattled

1322
02:20:23,900 --> 02:20:27,109
Now I know
fault lies in the basement!

1323
02:20:31,067 --> 02:20:34,139
Did I give you questions
to cross examine me?

1324
02:20:35,467 --> 02:20:39,540
I wanted to single out the white sheep
from the flock of black sheep

1325
02:20:45,034 --> 02:20:46,775
This is your phone statement

1326
02:20:50,767 --> 02:20:53,611
When I gave you the questions
it was 4:00 P.M

1327
02:20:55,001 --> 02:20:59,973
You've called Priya promptly at 4:05 P.M
and showed your sincerity!

1328
02:21:03,101 --> 02:21:04,102
What's the plan?

1329
02:21:05,467 --> 02:21:08,471
Krishna will not come to court tomorrow

1330
02:21:09,434 --> 02:21:11,243
Krishna has been kidnapped

1331
02:21:11,700 --> 02:21:12,610
By whom?

1332
02:21:13,634 --> 02:21:14,510
You, sir

1333
02:21:14,667 --> 02:21:17,147
That's what we intend telling in the court

1334
02:21:25,667 --> 02:21:28,648
So long you took a salary from me
but you were on their side

1335
02:21:29,367 --> 02:21:33,144
Today you will be on my side!

1336
02:21:47,467 --> 02:21:49,504
This is constable Ranga's house

1337
02:22:06,467 --> 02:22:10,745
Come out

1338
02:22:13,234 --> 02:22:15,111
Let's go see Nila

1339
02:22:43,301 --> 02:22:46,214
In my 20 years of experience
how many cases I've witnessed

1340
02:22:47,201 --> 02:22:49,272
This is the 1st time I have wanted
to see the petitioner face to face

1341
02:22:49,634 --> 02:22:50,738
I want Nila

1342
02:22:53,967 --> 02:22:55,139
I want to see her

1343
02:22:58,334 --> 02:23:02,714
Say this tomorrow in court
I'll show your true colors

1344
02:23:04,600 --> 02:23:08,309
I had closed all doors
I don't know how Krishna went out

1345
02:23:08,501 --> 02:23:09,571
Where could he have gone?

1346
02:23:09,700 --> 02:23:11,839
He must have gone to see Nila

1347
02:23:18,067 --> 02:23:21,480
Krishna knows only this place
If he isn't even here...?

1348
02:24:13,834 --> 02:24:16,974
How are you here?
What are you doing here?

1349
02:24:20,534 --> 02:24:21,706
I'm going

1350
02:24:22,433 --> 02:24:23,844
Stop...catch him

1351
02:24:24,133 --> 02:24:26,135
Watchman...stop him

1352
02:24:26,867 --> 02:24:28,175
Catch him

1353
02:24:43,333 --> 02:24:46,473
Did you pretend to bring him here?
Now you've helped him escape?

1354
02:24:47,167 --> 02:24:48,805
Don't make me lose face again!

1355
02:24:49,467 --> 02:24:51,447
I swear I am not part of this plan

1356
02:24:51,867 --> 02:24:53,312
He escaped of his own accord

1357
02:24:54,100 --> 02:24:56,137
He cannot think independently

1358
02:24:56,600 --> 02:24:57,476
You are the culprit

1359
02:24:58,167 --> 02:24:59,202
Please believe me

1360
02:24:59,334 --> 02:25:00,813
I am not part of this plan

1361
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:07,946
If he isn't back in an hour here...

1362
02:25:24,700 --> 02:25:26,771
What happened, deal?

1363
02:25:31,634 --> 02:25:36,515
Where the hell is she?
Don't worry, kiddo

1364
02:25:42,734 --> 02:25:44,077
Stop for a minute

1365
02:25:50,201 --> 02:25:53,671
Where did you go?
Your phone is switched off

1366
02:25:56,400 --> 02:26:00,644
Krishna is missing!

1367
02:26:01,100 --> 02:26:04,138
My mom is sick
I have to go now

1368
02:26:08,900 --> 02:26:10,106
I must go

1369
02:26:10,334 --> 02:26:12,473
Okay, I'll take care
You leave

1370
02:26:19,267 --> 02:26:24,216
Janaki, his temperature is 103F
How could you be so careless?

1371
02:26:25,234 --> 02:26:26,907
It's not enough
to just give birth to a child

1372
02:26:27,433 --> 02:26:28,377
Charity begins at home!

1373
02:26:28,500 --> 02:26:30,036
Social service should take a back seat

1374
02:26:31,834 --> 02:26:33,006
What's happened?

1375
02:26:33,267 --> 02:26:34,803
Now you ask me

1376
02:26:35,867 --> 02:26:38,814
This is what will happen if you are a dad
when you should be a grand dad!

1377
02:26:46,834 --> 02:26:47,778
Where are you going?

1378
02:26:48,800 --> 02:26:50,507
He's back, sir

1379
02:26:51,867 --> 02:26:52,845
Get this medicine

1380
02:27:01,700 --> 02:27:03,702
- Where did you find him?
- He himself came back, sir

1381
02:27:05,667 --> 02:27:08,375
Paracetamol for fever
Tixylix for cough

1382
02:27:09,934 --> 02:27:12,175
This is what I just prescribed

1383
02:27:18,567 --> 02:27:20,513
Who is this newcomer?

1384
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:26,837
Bashyam, you have an in-house doctor

1385
02:27:27,034 --> 02:27:29,537
Don't change doctors
just because I reprimanded you

1386
02:27:32,201 --> 02:27:36,809
Give this medicine after food
for the next 5 days, he'll be fine

1387
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:04,980
Good people face maximum hurdles

1388
02:28:07,234 --> 02:28:10,443
But they come out winners

1389
02:28:51,834 --> 02:28:56,681
We are ready with all that you wanted
Anything else?

1390
02:29:00,867 --> 02:29:05,043
Your child...fever

1391
02:29:09,501 --> 02:29:15,645
Medicine...thrice a day...after food

1392
02:29:29,667 --> 02:29:31,408
Let's submit the petition after the hearing

1393
02:29:31,500 --> 02:29:32,808
He won't go anywhere

1394
02:29:37,400 --> 02:29:38,470
Tell her

1395
02:30:03,333 --> 02:30:04,471
Traitor

1396
02:30:18,434 --> 02:30:24,385
My Lord! I request your permission
to cross examine the petitioner Krishna

1397
02:30:34,367 --> 02:30:35,368
What is your name?

1398
02:30:39,134 --> 02:30:41,341
My name is Krishna

1399
02:30:42,834 --> 02:30:44,006
Are you unwell?

1400
02:30:48,334 --> 02:30:49,813
Any other problem?

1401
02:30:52,800 --> 02:30:54,108
Look at m e

1402
02:30:56,634 --> 02:31:00,980
Then why were you
in a mental institution from 1986 to 2005?

1403
02:31:05,367 --> 02:31:09,509
My mother told me she was not well

1404
02:31:09,867 --> 02:31:11,847
Your mother was unwell, or you?

1405
02:31:16,900 --> 02:31:17,878
Your father?

1406
02:31:18,234 --> 02:31:23,013
My father went away to be with God

1407
02:31:26,401 --> 02:31:28,210
There is no connection
between this case and these questions

1408
02:31:28,367 --> 02:31:29,641
There is a link, My Lord

1409
02:31:29,967 --> 02:31:33,312
The reasons for his stay in a mental institute

1410
02:31:33,400 --> 02:31:34,970
...are not his mother's ill health
or father's demise

1411
02:31:35,401 --> 02:31:38,644
When he was 3, they found out
he was mentally challenged

1412
02:31:38,734 --> 02:31:40,680
They admitted him in that institute

1413
02:31:42,500 --> 02:31:45,106
I've produced evidence already in court

1414
02:31:53,567 --> 02:31:54,545
Who is Nila?

1415
02:31:55,234 --> 02:31:57,145
My daughter

1416
02:31:57,233 --> 02:31:58,507
How old is she?

1417
02:32:00,800 --> 02:32:01,870
What is she doing?

1418
02:32:02,234 --> 02:32:03,474
She goes to school

1419
02:32:03,667 --> 02:32:04,543
Which school?

1420
02:32:18,800 --> 02:32:20,780
If you can't even pronounce
her school's name

1421
02:32:21,434 --> 02:32:22,708
...how will you take care of Nila?

1422
02:32:23,067 --> 02:32:24,375
I'll be a good dad

1423
02:32:24,501 --> 02:32:25,502
How can you take care?

1424
02:32:26,934 --> 02:32:30,939
Nila will soon be 10
then 15 years, she'll attain puberty

1425
02:32:32,967 --> 02:32:36,676
She'll be 10 years older than you mentally

1426
02:32:36,801 --> 02:32:40,840
What will you do then?

1427
02:32:41,967 --> 02:32:45,107
- I will...
- You will...

1428
02:32:47,800 --> 02:32:49,575
- Nila...
- Nila...?

1429
02:32:58,000 --> 02:32:59,502
Nila is 5 now

1430
02:32:59,734 --> 02:33:05,548
When she is 6 years old, how can he,
sharing the same age take care of Nila?

1431
02:33:09,201 --> 02:33:14,173
Under the guise of questioning
learned counsel is threatening my client

1432
02:33:20,667 --> 02:33:22,738
I'll take care of Nila

1433
02:33:25,101 --> 02:33:26,876
I want Nila

1434
02:33:26,967 --> 02:33:28,469
Can you educate Nila the way she aspires?

1435
02:33:28,567 --> 02:33:31,013
Can you make her dreams come true?

1436
02:33:33,334 --> 02:33:34,312
You can't understand
Can you?

1437
02:33:34,734 --> 02:33:36,236
What will Nila be, if she is with you?

1438
02:33:38,667 --> 02:33:39,873
How will you make her a doctor?

1439
02:33:40,034 --> 02:33:42,537
You can't even remember her school's name

1440
02:33:42,700 --> 02:33:45,146
You needed help to get admission for her

1441
02:33:46,367 --> 02:33:49,177
What kind of future can you assure Nila?

1442
02:33:51,134 --> 02:33:52,135
I'll educate her

1443
02:33:52,267 --> 02:33:53,405
How will you make her a doctor?

1444
02:33:53,767 --> 02:33:55,007
Can you help her with her assignments?

1445
02:33:55,167 --> 02:33:58,671
Can you teach her Arithmetic?
Can you clear her doubts in Science?

1446
02:34:02,367 --> 02:34:04,347
- Do you know to teach her History?
- Tell him

1447
02:34:07,100 --> 02:34:11,549
When she's grown up can you
behave normally in society like her?

1448
02:34:11,633 --> 02:34:12,611
I want Nila

1449
02:34:12,834 --> 02:34:15,405
Do you want Nila to suffer
like how Bhanumathy did?

1450
02:34:16,400 --> 02:34:22,009
Forget making her a doctor
Can you make Nila a nurse?

1451
02:34:27,401 --> 02:34:30,507
I want Nila

1452
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:43,675
If Nila is with you,
you can't take care of her

1453
02:34:44,801 --> 02:34:46,212
She has to take care of you!

1454
02:34:55,534 --> 02:34:58,708
My client Mr Rajendran
is the child's legal guardian

1455
02:34:58,967 --> 02:35:03,211
According to the guardian and wards act

1456
02:35:30,967 --> 02:35:35,245
Habeus corpus petition
was filed in this court

1457
02:35:35,567 --> 02:35:41,279
That is to bring Nila here
regarding her illegal custody

1458
02:35:42,533 --> 02:35:46,481
Nila is with her grand father
respondent Rajendran

1459
02:35:48,500 --> 02:35:49,877
Where did you go?

1460
02:35:51,367 --> 02:35:54,576
This habeus corpus was a ploy
to distract the court's attention...

1461
02:35:56,000 --> 02:36:00,449
...and try rejecting the move
to make Rajendran her legal guardian

1462
02:36:00,634 --> 02:36:02,807
For this sole reason this petition
should be dismissed

1463
02:36:02,967 --> 02:36:05,311
Instead of appealing to a higher authority
and wasting valuable time

1464
02:37:31,400 --> 02:37:37,043
So My Lord, Nila to grow up with Krishna

1465
02:37:52,867 --> 02:37:54,540
I have no objections

1466
02:39:05,601 --> 02:39:07,581
Neither you nor I am the winner

1467
02:39:09,067 --> 02:39:10,671
It is Krishna's unconditional love

1468
02:39:13,567 --> 02:39:17,879
For the 1st time I am glad I lost

1469
02:39:27,800 --> 02:39:32,909
- It doesn't matter
- I had no other go

1470
02:39:35,401 --> 02:39:38,041
Krishna is here

1471
02:39:39,067 --> 02:39:42,071
Nila is here

1472
02:40:57,867 --> 02:41:00,404
She loves her daddy tonnes and gallons

1473
02:41:05,801 --> 02:41:10,716
Tell her I am not well if she asks

1474
02:41:12,701 --> 02:41:13,907
She will ask

1475
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:20,382
When she wakes up at 7:00 A.NI
she drinks a huge glass of milk

1476
02:41:21,767 --> 02:41:23,508
7:30 A.NI is her shower time

1477
02:41:24,434 --> 02:41:30,043
8:30 A.NI is her breakfast time

1478
02:41:30,167 --> 02:41:33,376
She doesn't like food that's too spicy

1479
02:41:33,601 --> 02:41:36,548
3:00 P.M she is back from school

1480
02:41:36,767 --> 02:41:39,338
4:00 P.M is her playtime

1481
02:41:47,667 --> 02:41:49,544
What have you done?

1482
02:42:00,800 --> 02:42:05,442
If Nila is with you,
you can't take care of her

1483
02:42:06,600 --> 02:42:08,170
She has to take care of you!

1484
02:42:14,034 --> 02:42:18,642
Nila should have all the comforts

1485
02:42:22,601 --> 02:42:27,016
I can't...

1486
02:42:30,867 --> 02:42:34,542
They can...

1487
02:42:38,700 --> 02:42:45,549
Nila will one day be a famous doctor

1488
02:43:03,334 --> 02:43:06,144
Nila will shine

1489
02:43:13,634 --> 02:43:16,444
