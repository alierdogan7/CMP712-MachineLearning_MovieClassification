1
00:00:00,376 --> 00:00:01,491
So here's what you missed
on <i>Glee...</i>

2
00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:03,052
I needed you around,
and you weren't there.

3
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,387
<i>Blaine cheated on Kurt</i>
<i>and they broke up,</i>

4
00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:06,239
<i>and Rachel and Finn</i>
<i>broke up, too, and Finn</i>

5
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:08,491
<i>has no idea what he wants to
do with his life.</i> We're done.

6
00:00:08,525 --> 00:00:09,993
<i>Jake has his eye on Marley,</i>

7
00:00:10,027 --> 00:00:11,894
<i>which Kitty's</i>
<i>really not happy about,</i>

8
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:13,162
<i>and Emma's not sure she wants</i>
<i>to leave McKinley</i>

9
00:00:13,197 --> 00:00:14,998
<i>to go to Washington with Will.</i>

10
00:00:15,032 --> 00:00:17,083
<i>And that's what</i>
<i>you missed on</i> Glee.

11
00:00:23,707 --> 00:00:25,741
Why do I always feel
so at home in a tire shop?

12
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:28,011
That was a joke.
What do you want, Artie?

13
00:00:28,045 --> 00:00:29,245
I got a lot of work to do.

14
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:30,413
I just wanted
to check in on you.

15
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:31,547
You've had
a rough couple of months,

16
00:00:31,581 --> 00:00:32,748
and I thought maybe
you could use a friend.

17
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:33,850
It's not that bad.

18
00:00:33,884 --> 00:00:35,418
I just embarrassed myself
out of the army,

19
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:37,086
lost Rachel completely,

20
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:39,588
and now I'm back in my hometown
working in a tire shop.

21
00:00:39,607 --> 00:00:41,257
Figure maybe my luck
will change soon

22
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:42,358
and one of the lifts will break,

23
00:00:42,393 --> 00:00:43,592
and I'll get crushed by a car.

24
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,530
I'm sorry, Artie.

25
00:00:47,564 --> 00:00:49,065
I appreciate what you're
doing; You're a great friend.

26
00:00:49,099 --> 00:00:50,400
I'm just kind of sitting
back and looking

27
00:00:50,434 --> 00:00:52,101
at the next 60
years of my life.

28
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,602
It just sort of makes me
want to puke.

29
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:55,288
But it is what it is.

30
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:56,439
Do you remember what I said

31
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:58,041
when I dedicated that song
to you last year?

32
00:00:58,075 --> 00:01:00,410
That you were
my friend, my hero.

33
00:01:00,444 --> 00:01:02,245
I'm not gonna let you bury
yourself in self-pity, Finn.

34
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:03,630
You're better than that.

35
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:05,548
You know, I've heard that
a lot all my life, Artie.

36
00:01:05,582 --> 00:01:07,550
That I'm better
than I think I am.

37
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,452
Well, look around.

38
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,920
Maybe I'm not.
You just lost

39
00:01:10,954 --> 00:01:12,788
your confidence
because you forgot your place.

40
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:13,956
You're a creative person.

41
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:15,892
You need to find
an artistic outlet.

42
00:01:15,926 --> 00:01:17,293
Come codirect the musical
with me.

43
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:18,761
<i>Grease</i> was your idea.
I don't know

44
00:01:18,795 --> 00:01:20,263
how to direct a musical, Artie.

45
00:01:20,297 --> 00:01:21,814
Directing is
about having an idea

46
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:23,466
and convincing everyone
around you to make it happen.

47
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:24,567
I don't think so.

48
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:25,985
Fine.

49
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,970
Then I'm not doing it, either,

50
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:29,489
which means there is no musical.

51
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:31,774
You can't do that, man,
hold the musical hostage.

52
00:01:31,808 --> 00:01:33,142
That's like terrorism.

53
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,678
Basically, Olivia Newton-John
is strapped to my chest,

54
00:01:35,713 --> 00:01:37,413
and unless you
codirect with me,

55
00:01:37,448 --> 00:01:38,498
I'm gonna blow her up.

56
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:40,816
I'm serious, Finn.

57
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,952
Trust me, as your friend,
you need to do this.

58
00:01:42,986 --> 00:01:44,337
Just so you can look
at the first month

59
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:45,621
of the next 60 years
of your life

60
00:01:45,655 --> 00:01:46,622
and not want to puke.

61
00:01:46,656 --> 00:01:48,174
Auditions are tomorrow.

62
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:57,572

63
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,419
(School bell ringing)

64
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:03,839
Sam: As president and vice
president, we can pretty much decree

65
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,708
which ever parts
we want, right?

66
00:02:05,743 --> 00:02:08,111
I'm not sure I'm gonna do
the musical this year.

67
00:02:08,145 --> 00:02:11,447
I'm not in the right headspace
to do a project like <i>Grease.</i>

68
00:02:11,482 --> 00:02:14,517
Since Kurt and I broke up,
I haven't slept,

69
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:16,018
I lost my appetite.

70
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:17,537
I don't even gel on week.

71
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:18,621
This is pretty serious, then.

72
00:02:18,655 --> 00:02:22,291
Sam, Kurt was my soul mate.

73
00:02:22,326 --> 00:02:25,694
We talked about spending
the rest of our lives together.

74
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:27,880
About retiring in Provincetown

75
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:29,882
and buying a lighthouse
and starting an artists' colony.

76
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:31,334
And now he won't even
return my calls.

77
00:02:31,368 --> 00:02:33,336
He won't text me.

78
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,554
And that <i>gilmore girls</i> box set

79
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:36,539
I sent him was returned
to me, unopened.

80
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:38,808
He's gone.

81
00:02:38,842 --> 00:02:41,210
Maybe forever.

82
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:43,229
Dude, I get it, except
for the lighthouse part.

83
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,380
But look, everybody's
been there.

84
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,681
You'll get through it.

85
00:02:47,951 --> 00:02:51,571

(Light applause)

Say something.

131
00:05:51,234 --> 00:05:52,702
Like what?

132
00:05:52,736 --> 00:05:53,536
I think I speak

133
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,837
for both of us when I say

134
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:57,173
that though you auditioned
with a Sandy song,

135
00:05:57,207 --> 00:05:59,875
you are the Danny
Zuko of our dreams.

136
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:01,744
Right?
Yeah, yeah, totally.

137
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:03,596
You were awesome.
Amazing.

138
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,847
I can't.

139
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:06,165
I'm sorry, I just can't, Finn.

140
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,916
I didn't want to let you down,

141
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:10,252
but <i>Grease</i> is a romance,

142
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:15,191
and how can I play any of the
scenes if I have ruined mine?

143
00:06:15,225 --> 00:06:17,226
The truth of Danny Zuko.

144
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,528
Thank you for letting me
audition, but I-I just can't.

145
00:06:19,563 --> 00:06:21,030
But wait.

146
00:06:21,064 --> 00:06:22,365
Is there any part you think

147
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,532
you could play?

148
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:25,117
I don't think so. Maybe...

149
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:26,569
Maybe teen angel.

150
00:06:26,603 --> 00:06:28,571
It's only one scene,

151
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:30,939
but probably not.

152
00:06:32,942 --> 00:06:36,128
Wow, I've never seen
Blaine so...

153
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:38,381
<i>Masterpiece theater.</i>

154
00:06:38,415 --> 00:06:39,782
Look, sorry, man. I know
you're just trying to help,

155
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,218
but this is a bad idea.

156
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:44,053
(School bell ringing)

157
00:06:44,087 --> 00:06:45,921
Finn, hold up.

158
00:06:45,955 --> 00:06:47,390
What was a bad idea?

159
00:06:47,424 --> 00:06:48,891
Me directing.

160
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:50,776
I'm not qualified
for any of this, Artie.

161
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:52,428
You have to trust
your instincts.

162
00:06:52,462 --> 00:06:54,096
But also, part of
being a good director

163
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,931
is surrounding yourself
with the right people.

164
00:06:55,965 --> 00:06:59,435
The right choreographer and
the right vocal Coach, right?

165
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:01,237
It is. Just trust me.

166
00:07:01,271 --> 00:07:02,938
So I called in some favors,

167
00:07:02,972 --> 00:07:06,525
and the cavalry
has just arrived.

168
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:22,991
(School bell ringing)

169
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,478
School arts programs are
going the way of the dinosaur.

170
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:27,930
Even the basics like choir
and band are disappearing.

171
00:07:27,964 --> 00:07:29,131
No one is disputing that.

172
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:30,299
All I'm saying is

173
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,600
if I go with Will
to Washington...

174
00:07:31,635 --> 00:07:33,602
Our relationship
will only grow.

175
00:07:33,637 --> 00:07:35,471
This is not just a
once-in-a-lifetime experience

176
00:07:35,505 --> 00:07:36,989
for me, but for both of us.

177
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:38,674
And I feel that Emma
is dismissing it.

178
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:40,026
And I feel
like Will just assumes

179
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,210
I'm gonna happily
drop everything,

180
00:07:41,244 --> 00:07:42,695
play the part of the dutiful,

181
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,146
1950s housewife,

182
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,865
even though we're not even
married yet.

183
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,149
She's made this analogy
several times.

184
00:07:47,183 --> 00:07:49,017
And that my job and my life

185
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,519
and my dreams

186
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,321
are somehow secondary
to that. I'm sorry,

187
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:53,956
but am I wrong
for feeling that way?

188
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,709
Pumpkins, bear Bryant once said,

189
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:58,327
"feelings aren't right
or wrong.

190
00:07:58,361 --> 00:07:59,628
They just are."

191
00:07:59,663 --> 00:08:01,230
My relationship with Cooter,
it was more sour

192
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:04,050
than Brian Urlacher's
compression shorts.

193
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,735
That doesn't mean true blue

194
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:07,169
sweeties like yourselves

195
00:08:07,203 --> 00:08:08,854
aren't gonna have
a flag on the play.

196
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,639
Take a timeout. Call an audible.

197
00:08:10,674 --> 00:08:11,974
It's all about knowing

198
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:13,809
when to pass and when to punt.

199
00:08:13,844 --> 00:08:16,529
That's very insightful, but...

200
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,864
Shannon's right.
Time-out, time-out.

201
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,150
Emma, I made a mistake when I
first talked to you about this.

202
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:22,385
So let me just rewind

203
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,320
and start from scratch.

204
00:08:24,354 --> 00:08:26,054
Oh, don't look like that, Emma.

205
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:28,074
Emma, Emma, I love you

206
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:29,992
with every fiber of my being.

207
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:32,661
And no matter where we go
or what we do,

208
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:35,264
I want us to always be together.

209
00:08:35,298 --> 00:08:36,999
This time, it's Washington.

210
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:39,235
Next time, it can be
anywhere you want to go.

211
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,486
So, I'm asking

212
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:45,207
my partner, my equal partner...

213
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:46,675
To join me.

214
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,378
Would you consider it?

215
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:54,416
I'll go.

216
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,051
You-you sure?

217
00:08:56,085 --> 00:08:59,305
(Sighs)

218
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,792
(School bell ringing)

219
00:09:02,826 --> 00:09:05,027
We have plenty of girls
auditioning for Sandy,

220
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:06,896
but we're gonna have
a serious Danny Zuko problem

221
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,263
if Blaine can't do it.

222
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,932
What are the other options?

223
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,266
How about Sam?

224
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,768
He's got his heart set
on Kenickie.

225
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:15,037
Uh, "Greased Lightning"
is my cell phone ringtone,

226
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:17,239
and I've been knocked out
by a car door before,

227
00:09:17,273 --> 00:09:19,041
so I was really looking forward
to re-creating

228
00:09:19,075 --> 00:09:21,276
the reality
of that moment onstage.

229
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,945
Joe hart?
Won't cut his dreads.

230
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:24,279
I look like Erykah Badu.

231
00:09:26,249 --> 00:09:28,617
Wait, what about puck's brother?
Can't he sing?

232
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:29,969
Not interested.
Why is it that we can't find

233
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:32,454
one dude to play the lead
in the school play?

234
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:34,039
Mercedes: Well, there aren't
a lot of dudes like you.

235
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,307
Even Mr. Shue had that problem

236
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:36,759
when he first started Glee Club.

237
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:38,293
That's why he went looking
for you.

238
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,496
(School bell ringing)

239
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:50,573
(Whistle blows)

240
00:09:50,607 --> 00:09:52,274
Get them up!

241
00:09:52,308 --> 00:09:53,993
Get your knees up. Let's go.

242
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:55,611
Hey, Coach.

243
00:09:55,645 --> 00:09:59,081
Finn. There's no prize
for running the slowest!

244
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:00,616
Come on!

245
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,585
Good-looking bunch of
recruits this year.

246
00:10:02,619 --> 00:10:04,086
Idiots on patrol.

247
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,671
But I'll knock them into shape.

248
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,122
Heck, I Coached you

249
00:10:07,156 --> 00:10:08,958
to a state championship.

250
00:10:08,992 --> 00:10:10,259
I'm kidding.

251
00:10:10,293 --> 00:10:11,660
You're one of a kind.

252
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:13,629
I just wish
you still believed that.

253
00:10:13,663 --> 00:10:15,497
Thanks, Coach.

254
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:18,801
It's just kind of hard to feel
that way about myself right now.

255
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:20,269
Give it time.

256
00:10:20,303 --> 00:10:22,188
You're going through
the biggest change in your life.

257
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,390
Guys like you
always find their way.

258
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:29,111
You think you got any guys
like that out here today?

259
00:10:29,145 --> 00:10:31,113
Searching for some
recruits of my own.

260
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:32,531
We need a male lead
for the musical.

261
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:39,521
What's his story?

262
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,356
Beiste:
Ryder Lynn, sophomore.

263
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,542
I think he flunked out
of his old school,

264
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:44,960
so they transferred him here.

265
00:10:44,995 --> 00:10:47,213
Sweet enough kid,

266
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,632
but he's a loner and can't learn
to play for his life,

267
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,051
and if you ask me,
I say he's got a lazy streak.

268
00:10:53,036 --> 00:10:54,703
Moves good, though.

269
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,339
You want to know the thing about
you that makes you special?

270
00:10:57,373 --> 00:10:58,807
It's not the singing
or the dancing

271
00:10:58,842 --> 00:11:00,309
or the way you threw the ball.

272
00:11:00,343 --> 00:11:01,927
It's that you could move people.

273
00:11:04,014 --> 00:11:06,348
Figure that Ryder kid's got
anything like that in him?

274
00:11:06,382 --> 00:11:08,150
Bieste:
Maybe.

275
00:11:08,184 --> 00:11:11,237
If he had the right guy
showing him the way.

276
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,405
Are you kidding me?
Huddle up!

277
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,107
Get over there!

278
00:11:19,235 --> 00:11:20,719
(School bell ringing)

279
00:11:20,753 --> 00:11:22,086
Hey, this is
the girls' bathroom.

280
00:11:22,105 --> 00:11:24,106
I sit when I pee.

281
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,108
How psyched are you
for <i>Grease</i> auditions?

282
00:11:26,142 --> 00:11:28,193
I want Sandy... so bad.

283
00:11:28,227 --> 00:11:29,528
I'm not auditioning.
What?!

284
00:11:29,562 --> 00:11:31,863
Why not?
You know you'd get a part.

285
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:35,099
I don't want <i>a</i> part;
I want <i>the</i> part: Rizzo.

286
00:11:35,118 --> 00:11:36,601
No offense, Sandra Dee,

287
00:11:36,619 --> 00:11:38,269
but Rizzo's the money
role of that show.

288
00:11:38,287 --> 00:11:39,871
A hot bitch who thinks
she's pregnant,

289
00:11:39,906 --> 00:11:41,206
and turns out to have
a heart of gold.

290
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,407
It's basically my life story.

291
00:11:42,441 --> 00:11:44,609
But they won't
give me the role.

292
00:11:44,627 --> 00:11:46,277
Everyone sees me
in drag as a joke or stunt

293
00:11:46,295 --> 00:11:47,946
when we're performing.

294
00:11:47,964 --> 00:11:49,714
But it would feel as weird
for me to play Danny Zuko

295
00:11:49,749 --> 00:11:50,916
as it would for you.

296
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,634
Artie and those guys know that.

297
00:11:52,668 --> 00:11:54,386
Just tell them you want
to audition for Rizzo,

298
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,221
and I'm sure they'll
give you a chance.

299
00:11:56,255 --> 00:11:57,806
(Toilet flushing) You know,
the casual eavesdropper,

300
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,258
hearing the feminine
lilt of your voices,

301
00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:02,427
would just assume you're
a couple of regular gals

302
00:12:02,461 --> 00:12:04,296
yappin' away in the crapper.

303
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,765
But then the unmistakable
scent of talcum powder

304
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:09,901
and day-old panty hose
tells a different story.

305
00:12:09,936 --> 00:12:12,571
Well, well, well, if it isn't
McKinley High's very own

306
00:12:12,605 --> 00:12:16,074
Tina stomach-Turner,
and her trusty sidekick...

307
00:12:16,108 --> 00:12:18,142
I'm trying to think of
a mean nickname for you

308
00:12:18,161 --> 00:12:19,578
and I'm blanking.

309
00:12:19,612 --> 00:12:21,646
But you, urethra Franklin,

310
00:12:21,664 --> 00:12:24,166
you are a boy and you
are fooling no one.

311
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,852
You are smuggling more
kielbasa under those gowns

312
00:12:26,886 --> 00:12:29,287
than a homesick Polish lady
trying to sneak through customs.

313
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:31,089
You can't say things like that.

314
00:12:31,123 --> 00:12:32,824
Oh, I think you'll find
I can say anything I want,

315
00:12:32,842 --> 00:12:36,160
absolutely stunning,
kind-faced, blue-eyed girl.

316
00:12:37,964 --> 00:12:40,799
Now, I know full well
that gender confusion

317
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,835
is the liberal media's
new darling,

318
00:12:43,853 --> 00:12:46,104
bored with drowning
the nation's airwaves

319
00:12:46,138 --> 00:12:48,339
with tinny sitcoms so gay
that you have to stretch

320
00:12:48,357 --> 00:12:50,308
a dental dam
over your television set

321
00:12:50,342 --> 00:12:51,776
in order to watch them safely.

322
00:12:51,811 --> 00:12:54,362
The Hollywood communists
are busy force-feeding us

323
00:12:54,397 --> 00:12:56,347
drag queen reality shows

324
00:12:56,365 --> 00:12:58,033
and soft profiles
of gender-confused

325
00:12:58,067 --> 00:13:00,619
hormone-gobbling pre-teens,

326
00:13:00,653 --> 00:13:02,204
who faint at the sight

327
00:13:02,238 --> 00:13:04,823
of their own genitals.

328
00:13:04,857 --> 00:13:08,210
There's no way in hell
you're gonna play Rizzo.

329
00:13:08,244 --> 00:13:10,061
I will not allow you

330
00:13:10,096 --> 00:13:11,630
to unleash a teenage maelstrom

331
00:13:11,664 --> 00:13:14,399
of gender-bent sexual confusion
at this school,

332
00:13:14,433 --> 00:13:16,134
so you can turn it around
and make it a launch party

333
00:13:16,168 --> 00:13:18,303
for your very own line
of male girdles

334
00:13:18,337 --> 00:13:20,555
and brand-new fragrance
call "nut whiff."

335
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:23,374
We don't care what you say.

336
00:13:23,392 --> 00:13:24,976
We're both auditioning
for that musical.

That had more energy

401
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:48,019
than the last three
auditions combined.

402
00:15:48,037 --> 00:15:50,538
Ladies, do you have any preference
for the parts you want to play?

403
00:15:50,573 --> 00:15:52,157
Sandy.
Definitely Sandy.

404
00:15:52,191 --> 00:15:53,708
What about you, Wade?

405
00:15:54,827 --> 00:15:57,078
I would like to play
the role of Rizzo.

406
00:15:59,715 --> 00:16:02,033
(School bell ringing)

407
00:16:11,927 --> 00:16:13,395
Finn:
Hey, Mr. Clippenger.

408
00:16:13,429 --> 00:16:16,481
Uh, you got a phone call
in the teachers' lounge.

409
00:16:16,515 --> 00:16:18,583
Why didn't they call my cell?

410
00:16:26,225 --> 00:16:27,492
Hey, what are you doing?

411
00:16:27,526 --> 00:16:29,060
Uh, studying.

412
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:30,829
In the study hall?
I think you're the first.

413
00:16:30,863 --> 00:16:32,363
(Laughs) Uh...

414
00:16:32,398 --> 00:16:33,531
I've got to work twice
as hard as everyone else

415
00:16:33,565 --> 00:16:35,050
to do half as well.

416
00:16:35,084 --> 00:16:37,368
I'm pulling a c-minus average
since I got here,

417
00:16:37,402 --> 00:16:39,421
and if I don't get it
up to a B,

418
00:16:39,455 --> 00:16:41,739
my parents are going to make me
quit football, so...

419
00:16:41,757 --> 00:16:43,942
Whatever it takes, you know?

420
00:16:43,976 --> 00:16:45,577
I'm-I'm sorry...
who are you again?

421
00:16:45,611 --> 00:16:46,711
Uh, Finn is my name.

422
00:16:46,745 --> 00:16:47,912
I graduated last year.

423
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,431
Played football, too.
Quarterback.

424
00:16:49,465 --> 00:16:52,083
Oh. Awesome.
I also had a c-minus average

425
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:53,435
in my sophomore year,

426
00:16:53,469 --> 00:16:55,270
but I graduated with
a b-plus.

427
00:16:55,304 --> 00:16:56,420
Are you serious?

428
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:58,389
How did you do that?
Glee Club.

429
00:16:58,423 --> 00:17:00,692
Learning the music and
the choreography,

430
00:17:00,726 --> 00:17:02,427
it just... opened up
my brain somehow.

431
00:17:02,461 --> 00:17:04,095
I'm not joining the Glee Club.

432
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,197
I mean, I hear it's fun, but...

433
00:17:06,232 --> 00:17:08,366
I've got too much
on my plate already.

434
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,035
Start slow, then.
Come try out for the musical.

435
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,204
Who knows? Maybe it could be
like one of those gateway drugs.

436
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:15,406
I don't sing.
Prove it.

437
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,441
Auditions are at 4:00
in the auditorium.

438
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,827
See you then.

439
00:17:20,663 --> 00:17:22,180
(School bell rings)

440
00:17:28,453 --> 00:17:29,921
(Sighs) Another one?

441
00:17:29,955 --> 00:17:32,456
I don't understand.
All I do is study.

442
00:17:32,475 --> 00:17:35,143
I haven't even seen <i>dark knight rises</i> yet.
Oh, it was good.

443
00:17:35,177 --> 00:17:37,512
Bane was a little hard
to understand, but so evil.

444
00:17:39,765 --> 00:17:41,099
(School bell rings)

445
00:17:41,133 --> 00:17:42,984
A director's job
is to make choices.

446
00:17:43,018 --> 00:17:44,569
You have to pick one.

447
00:17:44,603 --> 00:17:46,988
I-I don't know anything
about jukeboxes, Artie.

448
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:49,174
Well, that one is
a zodiac jukebox,

449
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,408
this is a wurlitzer bubbler...

450
00:17:50,442 --> 00:17:51,776
a knockoff, I'd imagine,

451
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:53,328
because an original goes
for around 40 grand...

452
00:17:53,362 --> 00:17:55,446
and that one is a seeburg...
you may recognize it

453
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,981
from the opening credits
of <i>happy days.</i>

454
00:17:56,999 --> 00:17:59,334
Oh! <i>Happy days</i> is a show
from the '50s,

455
00:17:59,368 --> 00:18:01,336
and so is <i>Grease,</i> so we should
use this one, right?

456
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,154
No, that's the exact
one we shouldn't use.

457
00:18:03,189 --> 00:18:04,422
It's cliché.

458
00:18:04,456 --> 00:18:05,924
I say we go with the zodiac.

459
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,959
But we're gonna have to change
the records in it.

460
00:18:07,993 --> 00:18:09,844
It's filled with classic rock
from the '80s.

461
00:18:15,701 --> 00:18:16,834
Ryder:
Hey.

462
00:18:16,852 --> 00:18:18,186
Hey!

463
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,305
Auditions aren't
till 4:00, but...

464
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:22,173
I just want to make sure
I'm doing everything I can

465
00:18:22,191 --> 00:18:23,608
to make my grades,

466
00:18:23,642 --> 00:18:25,176
and if I'm dumb, then so be it,

467
00:18:25,194 --> 00:18:26,794
but I want to be sure
I didn't miss anything.

468
00:18:26,829 --> 00:18:28,346
Great.
So you want to audition, then.

469
00:18:28,364 --> 00:18:30,798
As long as I don't have to sing.
(Laughs)

470
00:18:33,068 --> 00:18:35,453
You know, I, uh...
I used to be just like you.

471
00:18:35,487 --> 00:18:37,521
I didn't think that I
could do it, either...

472
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,990
But then...

473
00:18:39,024 --> 00:18:41,326
I just did it.

474
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,660
No thinking.

475
00:18:42,694 --> 00:18:44,862
I... I just started
singing and...

476
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,131
(Jukebox crackling, whirring) It
just started coming out of me and...

477
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,883
It felt awesome.

478
00:18:48,918 --> 00:18:51,169
Like a really good poop.

479
00:18:52,555 --> 00:18:54,956
Bet you're
a classic rock guy, right?

00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:22,870
Man, that was awesome.

532
00:21:22,905 --> 00:21:24,355
So what do you think?

533
00:21:24,373 --> 00:21:26,124
Should I audition?

534
00:21:26,158 --> 00:21:28,159
Dude, you just did.

535
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,700
(Laughs)

536
00:21:41,947 --> 00:21:43,347
(School bell ringing)

537
00:21:43,365 --> 00:21:45,816
Hi. I'm Ryder Lynn.

538
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,318
I know.

539
00:21:47,352 --> 00:21:49,486
I saw you in the football
game on Saturday.

540
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,039
You're end zone dances
are awesome.

541
00:21:52,073 --> 00:21:54,691
Ah...
I'm Marley.

542
00:21:54,709 --> 00:21:58,028
I know. I know.
Uh, your mom rules.

543
00:21:58,046 --> 00:22:00,381
She always sneaks me extra
meatballs on spaghetti day.

544
00:22:00,415 --> 00:22:01,415
Really?
Uh-huh.

545
00:22:01,466 --> 00:22:02,550
(Both laugh)

546
00:22:02,584 --> 00:22:03,918
Wow, she must really like you.

547
00:22:03,969 --> 00:22:05,836
Uh, Finn Hudson told me
that you were probably

548
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,338
gonna play Sandy
in the school play.

549
00:22:07,372 --> 00:22:10,841
I thought if we were gonna be
working together, I should say hi.

550
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,259
I think they want me
to play Danny.

551
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,878
What's that cologne you're
wearing, "jealousy by you"?

552
00:22:14,896 --> 00:22:16,513
Uh, what am I jealous of?

553
00:22:16,547 --> 00:22:18,766
Oh, just your girlfriend talking
to the hottest guy at McKinley

554
00:22:18,817 --> 00:22:20,901
who also happens to be
a star football player

555
00:22:20,936 --> 00:22:23,687
with yummy old-school
Justin Bieber hair.

556
00:22:23,721 --> 00:22:24,855
She's not my girlfriend.

557
00:22:24,889 --> 00:22:27,057
And who wants
Justin Bieber hair?

558
00:22:27,075 --> 00:22:29,276
Half-black guys
who can't grow it.

559
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:32,079
Sorry, but you had that coming
since you broke up with me.

560
00:22:32,113 --> 00:22:33,614
And nobody breaks up with me.

561
00:22:33,665 --> 00:22:36,083
Which is why I've been
telling people I dumped you

562
00:22:36,117 --> 00:22:37,701
because you have
a gross third nipple.

563
00:22:37,735 --> 00:22:39,286
Now, if you'll excuse me...

564
00:22:43,508 --> 00:22:44,708
Hey, Ryder.
Hey, Mona.

565
00:22:44,742 --> 00:22:45,960
It's Marley.

566
00:22:46,011 --> 00:22:48,128
Oh, right, "Marley,"
like the dead dog movie?

567
00:22:49,414 --> 00:22:51,932
I heard you killed
your <i>Grease</i> audition.

568
00:22:51,967 --> 00:22:54,602
And I know you're excited about
the prospect of playing Sandy

569
00:22:54,636 --> 00:22:56,437
because everyone knows
poor people don't have

570
00:22:56,471 --> 00:22:57,921
many opportunities to
actually enjoy anything.

571
00:22:57,939 --> 00:22:59,223
Which is why it's gonna be

572
00:22:59,257 --> 00:23:01,108
such a bummer when I
take the part from you.

573
00:23:01,142 --> 00:23:02,926
You're auditioning?
I am.

574
00:23:02,944 --> 00:23:05,562
By the way, Ryder, you should
know about this one's gene pool.

575
00:23:05,596 --> 00:23:07,147
She's only got a month or two
before she starts ballooning

576
00:23:07,198 --> 00:23:09,066
to her natural weight
of 5,000 pounds

577
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,969
and starts writing her memoir,
<i>fifty shades of gravy.</i>

578
00:23:12,003 --> 00:23:12,820
Wow, you're kind of a bitch.

579
00:23:12,871 --> 00:23:13,937
What'd she ever do to you?

580
00:23:13,955 --> 00:23:15,272
Besides trying to steal away

581
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,291
my three-nippled
ex-boyfriend?

582
00:23:17,325 --> 00:23:19,576
You cast yourself
as the poor little

583
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,594
simply adork-able
nice girl.

584
00:23:20,629 --> 00:23:21,945
But I know, and you know,

585
00:23:21,963 --> 00:23:23,780
and sweet baby Jesus
in the manger knows

586
00:23:23,798 --> 00:23:28,002
what you really are: A
scheming little kiss-ass.

587
00:23:28,053 --> 00:23:30,638
I'm single, by the way.

588
00:23:31,723 --> 00:23:33,891
(School bell ringing)

589
00:23:35,727 --> 00:23:38,012
Sign me up, too.

590
00:23:38,063 --> 00:23:40,630
I thought you were too cool
for the school play.

591
00:23:40,649 --> 00:23:42,850
Someone's got to keep you
from killing Marley.

592
00:23:42,901 --> 00:23:44,968
And keep Marley from
fornicating Ryder.

593
00:23:44,986 --> 00:23:47,321
I'm not as dumb as
you look, Puckerman.

594
00:23:47,355 --> 00:23:50,941
I have the perfect
audition song for us.

595
00:23:50,975 --> 00:23:52,259
Us?

Oh!
Whoo!

637
00:25:56,117 --> 00:25:58,935
Mercedes:
That was great, guys.

638
00:25:58,953 --> 00:26:02,272
Okay, we need to do that thing
where we call people back.

639
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:03,490
What's that called?

640
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:05,125
Both:
Callbacks.

641
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,911
I don't know. I feel like Kitty
has the inside track on Sandy.

642
00:26:07,945 --> 00:26:08,996
Sandy can't be brunette.

643
00:26:09,047 --> 00:26:10,447
Oh, like Maria
couldn't be black?

644
00:26:10,465 --> 00:26:12,749
That was a year ago,
Mercedes. Let it go.

645
00:26:12,783 --> 00:26:16,420
Okay, so we call back all the Sandys
and the Dannys. What about the rest?

646
00:26:16,454 --> 00:26:18,622
Brittany for cha-cha,
she's the best dancer.

647
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,290
You know, Tina would
make a great jan.

648
00:26:20,308 --> 00:26:21,642
It's too bad she won't audition

649
00:26:21,676 --> 00:26:24,144
because she refuses to be
in the same room with Mike.

650
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:25,979
Okay, what about Rizzo?

651
00:26:26,014 --> 00:26:28,348
Now, I know it's way outside
of the box,

652
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:30,017
but I like Unique for it.

653
00:26:30,068 --> 00:26:31,134
He wants it so badly.

654
00:26:31,152 --> 00:26:32,769
He's the best singer, too.

655
00:26:32,803 --> 00:26:35,639
So, we cast a brunette
as Sandy and a guy as Rizzo.

656
00:26:35,657 --> 00:26:37,658
Who's directing this, Julie Taymor?
Think about how cool

657
00:26:37,692 --> 00:26:39,476
it would be to do something
really different.

658
00:26:39,494 --> 00:26:41,328
Though I don't agree
with your choices,

659
00:26:41,362 --> 00:26:43,447
I appreciate your passion.

660
00:26:43,481 --> 00:26:45,999
It's nice to have
the old Finn back.

661
00:26:46,034 --> 00:26:47,618
Sue:
Finn Hudson?

662
00:26:47,652 --> 00:26:50,537
In Principal Figgins'
office now.

663
00:26:51,923 --> 00:26:54,291
Now, fatty!
(Bell ringing)

664
00:26:54,325 --> 00:26:56,126
The twin idiots seated
before you are poised

665
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,329
to cast the she-male-fabulous
Unique Adams

666
00:26:59,347 --> 00:27:00,848
as Rizzo in <i>Grease;</i>

667
00:27:00,882 --> 00:27:02,649
The already overly sexualized
minstrel show

668
00:27:02,684 --> 00:27:06,687
featuring teen pregnancy
and the ridiculously unnecessary

669
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:08,305
lubrication of lightning.

670
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:10,807
If they succeed,
they will set a legal precedent

671
00:27:10,841 --> 00:27:13,477
that will clear the way
for Unique to become a Cheerio!

672
00:27:13,511 --> 00:27:16,480
In the very year that I am set
to notch my 1,000th

673
00:27:16,514 --> 00:27:19,316
tournament victory
and become the winningest coach

674
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,034
in cheerleading history.

675
00:27:21,069 --> 00:27:23,320
Wait. When did Unique say
he wanted to be a Cheerio!?

676
00:27:23,354 --> 00:27:24,488
Sue, I don't understand.

677
00:27:24,522 --> 00:27:26,490
Unique Adams is nothing more

678
00:27:26,524 --> 00:27:28,525
than an attractive,
buxom young woman

679
00:27:28,543 --> 00:27:31,528
who's got it going on
in all the right places.

680
00:27:31,546 --> 00:27:32,746
She's a brick house, Sue!

681
00:27:32,797 --> 00:27:35,165
Uh, Principal Figgins,
Sue's right about that.

682
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:37,584
Unique is definitely a guy.

683
00:27:37,635 --> 00:27:39,586
What? I don't see
what the big deal is.

684
00:27:39,637 --> 00:27:41,889
If Unique identifies as a girl
and dresses

685
00:27:41,923 --> 00:27:44,341
as a girl, she should be allowed
to play one onstage.

686
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:46,876
Cross-gendered casting
is as old as theater itself.

687
00:27:46,895 --> 00:27:49,713
In Shakespeare's time, all the
female roles were played by men.

688
00:27:49,731 --> 00:27:50,681
There's no way that's true.

689
00:27:50,715 --> 00:27:52,015
In the last few years,

690
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,233
McKinley's become
the kind of place

691
00:27:53,268 --> 00:27:55,152
where all kinds of outcasts
can feel free

692
00:27:55,186 --> 00:27:58,021
to follow their dreams.
I don't think that should change

693
00:27:58,055 --> 00:27:59,907
just because
Coach Sylvester's a bigot.

694
00:27:59,941 --> 00:28:02,826
You know, I'd think twice
about calling someone a bigot

695
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,329
who's had gay Cheerios!, both
male and female on her squad,

696
00:28:05,363 --> 00:28:07,664
and who resigned her post
as principal in protest

697
00:28:07,699 --> 00:28:09,333
because this school
wasn't doing enough

698
00:28:09,367 --> 00:28:11,335
to protect a gay student
from being bullied!

699
00:28:11,369 --> 00:28:13,236
But you do have a point there,
mashed potato pants.

700
00:28:13,254 --> 00:28:14,705
We've become somewhat of a

701
00:28:14,739 --> 00:28:17,240
progressive bubble here at
McKinley High, and I think

702
00:28:17,258 --> 00:28:19,676
that's due to the fact
that the Glee Club is being run

703
00:28:19,711 --> 00:28:21,745
by a strange, weepy man-child
who has lotion

704
00:28:21,763 --> 00:28:23,547
in his hair,
but no adult friends.

705
00:28:23,581 --> 00:28:24,765
We live in Ohio.

706
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,434
And if you choose to cast Rizzo
with a naive,

707
00:28:27,468 --> 00:28:28,769
gender-confused boy

708
00:28:28,803 --> 00:28:32,773
in a dress,
I guarantee you someone...

709
00:28:32,807 --> 00:28:35,275
Is going to raise
a very public stink about it,

710
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:37,444
and I don't think that's fair.

711
00:28:37,478 --> 00:28:40,063
Don't put this kid in danger
because you want to make

712
00:28:40,097 --> 00:28:43,400
some grand gesture
about how open-minded you are.

713
00:28:43,434 --> 00:28:45,953
William, I spent the last year

714
00:28:45,987 --> 00:28:48,104
stifling my natural hatred
for you and helping you win

715
00:28:48,122 --> 00:28:50,607
a Glee Club
national championship.

716
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:52,376
Now is your moment
to pay me back by putting

717
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:54,277
a stop to this
so I don't have to.

718
00:28:54,295 --> 00:28:55,579
It's not my call, Sue.

719
00:28:55,613 --> 00:28:57,297
Finn and Artie are running
the musical this year,

720
00:28:57,332 --> 00:28:58,615
and I trust them implicitly.

721
00:28:58,633 --> 00:29:00,884
Enough! With all due respect,

722
00:29:00,918 --> 00:29:02,469
this is none of your business.

723
00:29:02,503 --> 00:29:04,972
I'm the director.
It's my decision.

724
00:29:05,006 --> 00:29:07,457
William, maybe you need to
remind chubby-wan-Kenobi

725
00:29:07,475 --> 00:29:10,260
of the daily nightmare that is
borne of being my enemy.

726
00:29:10,294 --> 00:29:11,645
You can't threaten me, Sue.

727
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,964
I've already lost my girlfriend,
my future, my pride.

728
00:29:14,983 --> 00:29:16,466
I've nothing more to lose.

729
00:29:16,484 --> 00:29:18,935
I'm casting Unique,
and that's all there is to it.

730
00:29:18,969 --> 00:29:22,105
And you know, I thought
that you would have known more

731
00:29:22,139 --> 00:29:24,241
about being an underdog after
you helped us win nationals

732
00:29:24,275 --> 00:29:25,942
and had a retarded baby,
but you...

733
00:29:28,696 --> 00:29:31,248
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to say that.

734
00:29:31,282 --> 00:29:34,951
That... that was the wrong word
to use. I apologize.

735
00:29:44,379 --> 00:29:46,496
(School bell ringing)

736
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:52,872
You look more crooked
than Joe Theismann's leg.

737
00:29:52,906 --> 00:29:54,791
It's just these places that the
realtor in Washington sent us.

738
00:29:54,842 --> 00:29:55,792
They all have carpeting.

739
00:29:55,843 --> 00:29:56,909
You know how many germs

740
00:29:56,927 --> 00:29:58,044
and bugs and fluids
live in carpeting?

741
00:29:58,078 --> 00:29:59,179
Call Stanley Steemer.

742
00:29:59,213 --> 00:30:00,913
Cleaned carpets
that don't dry properly

743
00:30:00,931 --> 00:30:03,216
can create kawasaki syndrome.

744
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:07,520
You know what the worst thing
you can do in a relationship is?

745
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,856
Besides hitting, of course?
Lie.

746
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:12,108
You don't want to go
with Will to Washington.

747
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,110
I saw it in your face
when you told him you would.

748
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,863
I have reservations; That is
much different from lying.

749
00:30:16,897 --> 00:30:18,281
You know what they say
about reservations?

750
00:30:18,315 --> 00:30:20,700
They won't seat you
till the whole party's there.

751
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,769
Dishonesty eats away
at a marriage.

752
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:24,070
You have to tell him
you don't want to go.

753
00:30:24,104 --> 00:30:26,289
I can't. I can't get in the way
of his dreams.

754
00:30:26,323 --> 00:30:27,540
That's what Terri did.

755
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:31,294
Pumpkin, Will loves you

756
00:30:31,328 --> 00:30:34,080
like a farmer loves
his blue ribbon pig.

757
00:30:34,114 --> 00:30:37,584
He'll understand.

758
00:30:37,618 --> 00:30:41,588
I'm going. It's decided.

759
00:30:41,622 --> 00:30:43,757
Then you'd better find
something to get excited about

760
00:30:43,791 --> 00:30:45,091
doing down there besides him.

761
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:47,477
You know I love Will,
but I think you've spent

762
00:30:47,511 --> 00:30:50,063
so much time working on being
his girl that you forgot

763
00:30:50,097 --> 00:30:52,982
that the reason he's so into you
is because of all the things

764
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,934
you are <i>besides</i> that.

765
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:03,076
(School bell ringing) I've been
trying to see you since I got here,

766
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,812
but every time I get
near you, you disappear.

767
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,497
I was fine with our breakup.

768
00:31:07,531 --> 00:31:09,616
Out of sight, out of mind.
But maybe you

769
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,751
could have called and asked
if I could handle you

770
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,169
choreographing
the school musical!

771
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,171
I'm sorry. Artie called me.

772
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,824
It seemed like a fun idea.
I didn't think you'd be upset.

773
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:19,626
Neither did I!

774
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,594
I know this is weird.
It's weird for me, too,

775
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:22,846
but if that's
what's stopping you

776
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,163
from auditioning for <i>Grease,</i>

777
00:31:24,181 --> 00:31:26,015
then we have to
make this not weird.

778
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,834
There are still some
good parts left.

779
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:29,602
I'm sorry, I can't.

780
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:32,355
We could use you.
You're so talented.

781
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:35,391
I'm sorry. You're gonna have
to survive without my talent.

782
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,811
(Sighs)

783
00:31:37,845 --> 00:31:39,779
(School bell ringing)

784
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,348
All right! You guys
killed your auditions,

785
00:31:42,366 --> 00:31:46,853
but there can only be one Sandy
and there can only be one Danny.

786
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:48,855
The heart of <i>Grease</i>
is the Danny-Sandy romance.

787
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:51,023
This callback is all
about the chemistry.

788
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:54,377
We want to see how well you play
off each other. Is there heat?

789
00:31:54,411 --> 00:31:56,996
Finn: We also want to see how
you sing and dance '50s-stye.

790
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:59,215
That's why we gave you the
audition song ahead of time.

791
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,000
I don't really read
music, so...

792
00:32:01,035 --> 00:32:02,802
Mike:
It's okay.

793
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,221
Mercedes and I will get you started.
Kitty: Start away.

794
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,807
Everyone knows Kitty cat's
gonna finish it.

795
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,976
Oh, you have a lot
of attitude, little girl.

796
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:13,880
Let's see if you have the stuff
to back it up. Hit it.

(School bell ringing)

837
00:34:40,402 --> 00:34:43,287
Hey. I came to talk
to you about the play.

838
00:34:44,206 --> 00:34:45,390
I get it.

839
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:47,317
I heard about
Coach Sylvester's meltdown.

840
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:50,436
I want to offer you the part.

841
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,858
but what about Coach Sue?

842
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:56,459
Well, Coach Sue isn't
directing the play.

843
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:58,078
I am.

844
00:34:58,112 --> 00:35:01,197
So now all you got to worry
about is getting a curly way

845
00:35:01,227 --> 00:35:03,497
***

846
00:35:03,617 --> 00:35:05,118
and I'll take care of Coach Sue

847
00:35:05,152 --> 00:35:08,238
or anybody else who
might try and st us.

848
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,874
Unique knows the song
and has the wig.

849
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:12,342
Good.

850
00:35:14,762 --> 00:35:17,063
You okay?

851
00:35:17,098 --> 00:35:19,833
I feel right
the men's locker room.

852
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,634
But I can't go into the girls'.

853
00:35:21,669 --> 00:35:24,988
And I don't feel right
in men's clothing,

854
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:27,907
but I can't wear
dresses every day.

855
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,082
It's just nice, for once,

856
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:42,005
yeah, it is.

857
00:35:44,658 --> 00:35:46,343
Well, uh...

858
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:48,661
(Sniffs)

859
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,296
Before I post the cast list,

860
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:51,915
I just need to Kat you're ready.

861
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:53,433
'Cause there's gonna be
a lot of heat on you,

862
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:55,802
and like I said, I can shield
you from some of it, but...

863
00:35:55,836 --> 00:35:57,303
At the end of the day,
you're gonna be the one

864
00:35:57,337 --> 00:35:58,738
out on that stage.

865
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,877
(School bell ringing)

866
00:36:32,539 --> 00:36:34,891
All right, all right.

00:37:05,739 --> 00:37:08,108

868
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,784
Patty Simcox?

869
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,770
Patty Simcox?

870
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:22,555
Who the hell is Patty Simcox?

871
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:25,925
I don't understand.

872
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:28,061
I pray really hard about this.

873
00:37:28,095 --> 00:37:29,512
Maybe God didn't hear you
because he was busy

874
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:32,782
helping people with cancer.
Shut it, Avatar.

875
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:35,084
This is all your fault.
You screwed up "hand -jive."

876
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,287
No, I didn't.
We were both great.

877
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:39,405
It just didn't work out.

878
00:37:39,439 --> 00:37:40,924
I've been hearing that
a lot lately from you.

879
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:45,812
Oh. One little thing,
honey boo boo.

880
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,630
I know a good, hot meal
is hard to resist,

881
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:50,083
especially when you're on
the free lunch program

882
00:37:50,117 --> 00:37:53,286
but remember, the stage always
*** at least ten pounds.

883
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,638
In your case, it's close to 90.

884
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:56,848
So, when you and your mom,
strawberry hugryake,

885
00:37:56,866 --> 00:37:58,819
are dumpster diving for your costume,

886
00:37:58,828 --> 00:38:01,227
keep on picking till you
find something slimming.

887
00:38:01,262 --> 00:38:03,963
Like a back hefty bag.

888
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:06,432
Kitty, my baby needs to be fed.

889
00:38:37,313 --> 00:38:39,865
Emma, wow.

890
00:38:42,001 --> 00:38:43,835
Did I forget it's one of
our anniversaries?

891
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:46,321
What? No.
(Sighs)

892
00:38:46,339 --> 00:38:48,290
Your parents aren't
here, are they?

893
00:38:48,324 --> 00:38:50,125
No no no. No, no.
I just thought I would, um,

894
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:51,960
challenge myself with
a few new recipes, that's all.

895
00:38:51,994 --> 00:38:53,962
Okay. How many new recipes?

896
00:38:53,996 --> 00:38:56,598
Uh, two or three.
Or seven. Sorry.

897
00:38:56,632 --> 00:38:58,016
If you want, in just a couple
minutes, they'll be ready.

898
00:38:58,051 --> 00:38:59,685
Just let them cool for a second.

899
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:02,104
Um...,
I just got home early

900
00:39:02,138 --> 00:39:04,272
and I, uh, came across
these cookbooks

901
00:39:04,307 --> 00:39:06,508
my mom got me when I got married
to Carl, and I thought you'd like it.

902
00:39:06,526 --> 00:39:08,510
You know what? I've never
tried these. And I feel like

903
00:39:08,528 --> 00:39:10,812
I do that sometimes, and it's
really not fair. Emma... ma.

904
00:39:10,814 --> 00:39:12,114
Sometimes I need to try...
Emma.

905
00:39:12,148 --> 00:39:14,116
Emma, stop.

906
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:16,535
Just... whatever it is,

907
00:39:16,569 --> 00:39:18,987
just say it.

908
00:39:20,573 --> 00:39:22,991
I don't want to go to
Washington with you.

909
00:39:28,331 --> 00:39:30,716
Could you just sit down?

910
00:39:31,834 --> 00:39:34,202
Just hear me out.

911
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:41,209
(Clears throat)
For the past three years,

912
00:39:41,227 --> 00:39:44,012
all I've wanted
was to be your wife.

913
00:39:44,046 --> 00:39:45,731
But then when I rely
stop to think about that,

914
00:39:45,765 --> 00:39:47,232
I have no idea what
that means to me,

915
00:39:47,266 --> 00:39:48,650
to be a wife.

916
00:39:48,684 --> 00:39:50,152
You know? I, um...

917
00:39:50,186 --> 00:39:52,821
I know what it meant to my mom.
It meant, you know,

918
00:39:52,855 --> 00:39:54,523
having supper on the table
when my dad got home.

919
00:39:54,557 --> 00:39:56,858
It meant lots of
"whatever you say, dear"s.

920
00:39:56,892 --> 00:39:58,894
It was heroic doses of
clonopin and chardonnay, and...

921
00:39:58,928 --> 00:40:01,079
That's not the life I want.
I know.

922
00:40:01,114 --> 00:40:03,081
I love you.

923
00:40:03,116 --> 00:40:05,233
I love you, but I love my job.

924
00:40:05,268 --> 00:40:06,585
I love my kids.

925
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:08,203
I love helping my kids.

926
00:40:08,237 --> 00:40:09,588
I love that you love your job,

927
00:40:09,622 --> 00:40:11,089
and I... I am so
incredibly excited

928
00:40:11,124 --> 00:40:13,508
for this job opportunity
for you, I really am.

929
00:40:13,543 --> 00:40:16,044
But I am terrified

930
00:40:16,078 --> 00:40:17,745
that if I go with you,
I'm gonna resent you.

931
00:40:17,764 --> 00:40:19,247
And then I'm gonna pull away.

932
00:40:19,265 --> 00:40:20,882
I would rather be here,

933
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:22,750
far from you
but feeling really close,

934
00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:26,087
rather than close to you
but feeling really far away.

935
00:40:29,258 --> 00:40:30,859
You upset?

936
00:40:30,893 --> 00:40:32,093
No.

937
00:40:32,111 --> 00:40:34,196
I me...

938
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,930
Do I like the idea of
not waking up next to you

939
00:40:35,948 --> 00:40:37,199
every day for a few months?

940
00:40:37,233 --> 00:40:38,600
Of course not.

941
00:40:38,618 --> 00:40:40,786
But you're right.

942
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,404
I've spent so much
time talking about

943
00:40:42,438 --> 00:40:45,073
getting married,
and no time talking about

944
00:40:45,107 --> 00:40:47,909
what being a husband and
wife really means to us.

945
00:40:51,447 --> 00:40:53,965
What does it mean to you?

946
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,051
Trust.

947
00:40:56,085 --> 00:41:00,138
Having a partner I know I will
always be honest with me.

948
00:41:00,173 --> 00:41:02,974
Who I know I will
always be honest with.

949
00:41:03,009 --> 00:41:04,593
What about you?

950
00:41:04,627 --> 00:41:06,928
Someone to accept me.

951
00:41:06,962 --> 00:41:08,430
All of me.

952
00:41:08,464 --> 00:41:11,483
Someone who I accept and adore.

953
00:41:11,517 --> 00:41:14,269
Neither of us said someone
who is with me every minute,

954
00:41:14,303 --> 00:41:16,771
or compromises their dreamsine.

955
00:41:16,773 --> 00:41:18,306
No.

956
00:41:18,324 --> 00:41:21,142
So... Then I guess
we're okay.

957
00:41:22,811 --> 00:41:26,281
Um... we will
switch off weekends.

958
00:41:26,315 --> 00:41:27,415
I'll come up or
you'll come down.

959
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:28,583
And then I will come home,

960
00:41:28,618 --> 00:41:31,219
and then we will
finally get married.

961
00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:35,624
(School bell ringing)

962
00:41:35,658 --> 00:41:37,008
How you doing, buddy?

963
00:41:37,043 --> 00:41:38,760
Yeah. Good. But...

964
00:41:38,794 --> 00:41:40,828
How am I supposed to make
a car fly onstage

965
00:41:40,847 --> 00:41:43,682
in the auditorium?
(Laughs)

966
00:41:43,716 --> 00:41:45,333
You're really throwing yourself
into the musical, huh?

967
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:46,852
I guess they're wrong

968
00:41:46,854 --> 00:41:50,639
when they say you
can't go home again.

969
00:41:50,673 --> 00:41:53,191
Well, it's not about being
back in high school again.

970
00:41:53,226 --> 00:41:54,476
I'm not interested in that.

971
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,478
I guess it's just...

972
00:41:56,512 --> 00:41:59,197
Nice helping other people's
dreams come true.

973
00:41:59,232 --> 00:42:01,566
It's called being a teacher.

974
00:42:02,851 --> 00:42:04,202
I'm really gonna miss it.

975
00:42:05,488 --> 00:42:07,188
Wait, what do you mean?

976
00:42:07,206 --> 00:42:09,341
I'm leaving.

977
00:42:09,375 --> 00:42:10,825
Not-not for good,

978
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:12,043
but for a few months.

979
00:42:12,078 --> 00:42:13,662
I'm going to Washington

980
00:42:13,696 --> 00:42:15,480
to fight to keep the as
alive in our schools.

981
00:42:15,515 --> 00:42:17,132
I figure if I don't
take a stand now,

982
00:42:17,166 --> 00:42:19,217
there won't be auditoriums
left to fly cars in.

983
00:42:19,252 --> 00:42:22,504
But, Mr. Shue, you can't just
leave the Glee Club like that,

984
00:42:22,538 --> 00:42:24,005
with no one in charge.
They need you.

985
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:25,340
(Sigh)

986
00:42:25,374 --> 00:42:27,041
No, they need a leader.

987
00:42:29,729 --> 00:42:31,045
Someone who understands
how to win,

988
00:42:31,063 --> 00:42:32,647
but also understands that winning

989
00:42:32,682 --> 00:42:35,383
is not more important than
doing the right thing,

990
00:42:35,401 --> 00:42:37,235
or taking care of each other.

991
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:39,521
Someone who's really good at
making kids' dreams come true.

992
00:42:39,555 --> 00:42:41,239
I spoke to Principal
Figgins about it,

993
00:42:41,274 --> 00:42:43,558
and since Glee Club
is not an actual class,

994
00:42:43,576 --> 00:42:46,161
we don't need a certified
teacher to run it.

995
00:42:46,195 --> 00:42:47,696
We just need an adult.

996
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:50,665
Mr. Shue, I'm not an adult.
First of all,

997
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,201
I think maybe it's time
you start calling me Will.

998
00:42:53,235 --> 00:42:55,403
And second how
you stood up to Sue.

999
00:42:55,421 --> 00:42:57,071
How you went out and found Ryder.

1000
00:42:57,089 --> 00:42:58,873
You're ready.

1001
00:42:58,907 --> 00:43:01,426
And if you're willing, then
I can promise you that

1002
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,011
there's no greater
joy in the world

1003
00:43:03,045 --> 00:43:05,545
than helping a young boy
like you turn into a man.

1004
00:43:08,006 --> 00:43:09,385
It's three months.

1005
00:43:09,915 --> 00:43:10,887
So what are you doing?

1006
00:43:12,027 --> 00:43:13,671
Will you take over the Glee Club?

1007
00:43:14,864 --> 00:43:19,618
