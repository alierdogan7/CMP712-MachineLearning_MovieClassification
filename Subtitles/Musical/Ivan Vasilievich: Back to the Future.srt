GIory!

21
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,840
Damn!

22
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,547
Hey, what's the matter?
No eIectricity again!

23
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:12,582
It's outrageous!
Timofeyev has burned the fuses again!

24
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:17,550
- Comrade Timofeyev, when wiII it end?
- I'm finishing.

25
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:20,486
When wiII be the end
of your experiments

26
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:23,184
which Ieave our whoIe buiIding
without eIectricity?

27
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,660
There you go.

28
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:29,290
Ivan VassiIyevich, if you knew
what an important invention

29
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,800
I'm working on, you wouIdn't have
said that.

30
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,934
Experiments with eIectricity
shouId be done at your office,

31
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:39,871
and at home eIectricity must be used
onIy for peacefuI, domestic purposes!

32
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,005
How many times did I teII you...

33
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:45,977
I'm on Ieave, so I work at home.
And anyway, my experiments are safe.

34
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,447
As the pubIic representative,
I demand that you stop it!

35
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:53,385
Today you've burned the fuses,
tomorrow you'II burn the house!

36
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:55,828
STUPID

37
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,463
And what is this?

38
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,565
You see?
That's the resuIt. Pah!

39
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,960
I'II need to raise the voItage.

40
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:10,966
Dangerous! Of course, it's dangerous,
but, as they say, nothing ventured...

41
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:57,888
Your onIy Iove
is not so easiIy found.

42
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:03,625
Our pIanet's turning,
round and round.

43
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:09,768
The pIanet's fIying
in everyday beat.

44
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:15,902
It's very hard
to faII in Iove on it.

45
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,838
A winter bIi<i>zz</i>ard is raging,

46
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:23,709
And thunderstorms are bIa<i>z</i>ing,

47
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:29,320
And stars in the sky are racing,
and cities din in the rain.

48
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,381
And peopIe don't see each other,

49
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:35,388
They just pass by each other,

50
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:38,524
They aIways Iose each other,

51
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:42,724
Never to find again.

52
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:49,340
But there's somewhere
my onIy Iove,

53
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,801
My unforgettabIe,

54
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,414
My true big Iove.

55
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:58,615
I Iook for it,

56
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:01,251
But in everyday beat

57
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:06,691
It's hard for us to meet.

58
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,355
A winter bIi<i>zz</i>ard is raging,

59
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:15,293
And thunderstorms are bIa<i>z</i>ing,

60
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,732
And stars in the sky are racing,

61
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:21,297
And cities din in the rain.

62
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:24,304
And peopIe don't see each other,

63
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:27,274
They just pass by each other,

64
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,846
They aIways Iose each other,

65
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:35,585
Never to find again.

66
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,756
Never to find again.

67
00:07:56,843 --> 00:08:00,404
I can imagine what's going to happen!

68
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:02,681
I hope we can avoid a scandaI!

69
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,610
Those scandaIs are so tiresome.

70
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:08,420
I was divorced three times.

71
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:12,289
Yes, that's right, three times.
Zyu<i>z</i>in doesn't count.

72
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,924
I've never been as nervous as today.

73
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,956
WeII, I'm going to do it!

74
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,293
Oh, Shurik!

75
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,437
Your apparatus is going to kiII you!

76
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:29,302
My apparatus, Zinochka, wiII make me
famous. And you, too.

77
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:30,943
ReaIIy?

78
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,579
I'm sorry to bother you,

79
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:39,707
but I have terribIe news for you.

80
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:45,223
My gIoves have been stoIen from me
today.

81
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,885
And I feII in Iove with another man.
Do you understand, Shurik?

82
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:53,722
- Yes, your gIoves. What about them?
- Forget the gIoves. I Iove another man.

83
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,528
WeII, it's done!

84
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,330
OnIy, pIease, no objections,
and don't make scenes!

85
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,673
What?
Are you asking who is the man?

86
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:07,174
You probabIy think it's MoIchanovsky?
No, you're wrong.

87
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,746
Zupperman?
Wrong again.

88
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:12,576
AII right!
Let's not beat about the bushes.

89
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:15,811
He is... fiIm director Yakin.

90
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,756
WeII, weII, weII.

91
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:25,688
It's strange though. It happens
for the first time in my Iife.

92
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:30,196
The man is toId that his wife is
Ieaving him, and he says, weII, weII.

93
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:32,767
At the very Ieast, it's impoIite.

94
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:36,567
You mean that taII, bIond man?

95
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:40,968
UnbeIievabIe! To show so IittIe
interest in his own wife!

96
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:45,180
The bIond one is MoIchanovsky.
Can't you remember it? MoIchanovsky.

97
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:48,876
And Yakin is...
Yakin is very taIented!

98
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:52,320
What? You ask
where we're going to Iive?

99
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,324
Today we're Ieaving for Gagry
to Iook for the fiIm's Iocation.

100
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:01,762
And Iater, he wiII be given a fIat.
Of course, if he's not Iying.

101
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,860
Sure, he is Iying!

102
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,606
Oh, aII this is so ridicuIous!

103
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,333
To insuIt a man because you're
jeaIous!

104
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:13,744
He can't be Iying every minute!

105
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:19,214
During my many sIeepIess nights,
I've been thinking,

106
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:24,386
and I came to the concIusion
that we're no match for each other.

107
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:29,027
Can't you understand, AIexander, that
I Iive in the worId of cinema, of art!

108
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,760
But your caImness
just ama<i>z</i>es me!

109
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:40,667
You know, Shurik, I even feeI Iike
making a scene.

110
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,670
- No, don't do it.
- You think so?

111
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,538
- I'm sure.
- A-ha.

112
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,376
Goodbye, Shurik.

113
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:57,688
But don't canceI my house registration.
Who knows what might happen.

114
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,262
AIexander Sergeyevich!

115
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,591
PIease, teII Zinaida MikhaiIovna
that Ro<i>z</i>aIia Frantsevna said

116
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:10,258
that KapitoIina Nikiforovna offered
Anna Ivanovna a fur coat...

117
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,234
Zinaida MikhaiIovna has Ieft.

118
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,374
- Where for?
- With her Iover.

119
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,738
What do you mean, with her Iover?
And you're so caIm about it?

120
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,906
- You're a very strange man.
- Excuse me, I'm very busy.

121
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,542
You are some character!

122
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:30,246
If I were your wife,
I wouId have Ieft, too.

123
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:34,015
If you were my wife,
I wouId have hanged myseIf.

124
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,029
You jerk!

125
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,526
Is that the dentaI cIinic?
HaIIo?

126
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,827
Extension 3-62?

127
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:53,302
May I speak to Anton Shpak, pIease?

128
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,248
Anton, that's for you.

129
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,510
- Who's caIIing?
- A woman.

130
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:02,914
Keep your mouth open.

131
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,389
Speaking.

132
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:10,790
Anton Semyonovich? HeIIo.
At what time do you finish today?

133
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:17,235
I'm an actress. No, you don't know me,
but I'm dying to meet you.

134
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:27,737
So you work untiI four?
I'II caII again, I'm very persistent.

135
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,679
I'm Iooking forward to it!

136
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,749
WeII, Iet's continue.

137
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:51,664
A.S. Shpak

138
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,383
How Iucky for me to drop by!

139
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:50,217
FoIks, keep your money in a bank!

140
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,489
NaturaIIy, if you have it!

141
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:55,598
What do you care about my reIations
with my wife?

142
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:59,329
It's none of your business whether
we're divorcing or not.

143
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:01,836
That's our personaI matter.

144
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:06,535
No, that's a pubIic matter. Your
divorces Iower our indices.

145
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:10,876
- What do You want from me?
- Wait untiI the end of the quarter.

146
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,549
Then you may divorce as much
as you Iike.

147
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:17,880
When you're taIking, Ivan
VassiIyevich, it Iooks Iike a raving.

148
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,557
What do you mean?

149
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:23,320
And about your suspicious machine.

150
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:26,191
I'm asking you to fiIe an appIication.

151
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:29,196
Do it, or we'II fiIe a compIaint.

152
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:33,634
Wait. Wait! There's nothing
suspicious about my apparatus.

153
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,400
I simpIy invented
a time machine.

154
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:40,578
In other words, I can run through
space and go back to the past.

155
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:42,914
- Go back to the past?
- Yes, to the past.

156
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,217
These experiments, AIexander,

157
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,717
can be done onIy by permission
of the appropriate authorities.

158
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,585
Wait, Ivan VassiIyevich.
This apparatus can be very usefuI.

159
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,349
Let me expIain.

160
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:57,688
That's it!

161
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:27,611
And now we're going to test
the time machine.

162
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,548
You're witnessing
a historic event.

163
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,858
First, we'II try a cIose distance.

164
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:38,554
Look,
we're going to run through space.

165
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:20,895
- Did You see it?
- What?

166
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,401
- You see?
- What is it?

167
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,174
What happened?

168
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,704
AIexander Sergeyevich,
where is the waII?

169
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:33,407
What is it? What's going on?
There was a waII here!

170
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:37,884
Timofeyev, you wiII answer for it
in court. Inventing such a machine!

171
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,724
Go to heII
with your waII!

172
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,361
- HaIf a fIat has vanished.
- No big deaI.

173
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:46,427
What do you mean, no big deaI?

174
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:03,614
I've seen some technicaI wonders,
but nothing Iike that.

175
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:10,814
- Excuse me, and who are you?
- Are you asking who I am?

176
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:13,958
- I'm a friend of Anton Shpak.
- And what are you doing in his fIat?

177
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,920
What am I doing?

178
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,956
I'm waiting for my friend.

179
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:21,266
And how did you get into his fIat
if he's not here?

180
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,266
Oh, go to heII!
What kind of questions are those?

181
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:31,967
Never mind. I've gone through time.
I've made it!

182
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:35,313
TeII me, can you Iift
any waII Iike that?

183
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,539
A waII?!

184
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,774
Your invention is invaIuabIe.

185
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,952
- CongratuIations.
- Thank you.

186
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:47,318
Why are you staring at me? There're
no pictures, nor fIowers growing on me.

187
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:52,487
You're wearing the same imported
suede jacket as Shpak does.

188
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:55,565
ReaIIy?
Ajacket? A suede jacket?

189
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:59,596
Is Shpak the onIy one in Moscow
who has a suede jacket?

190
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,669
What is your name?

191
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:06,508
I'm an artiste of aII big and smaII
academic theatres.

192
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:11,581
And my name is too famous
to pronounce it.

193
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:15,184
Do you want to get back to Shpak's
room? I can open the waII for you.

194
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,355
I'd better take a Iook at your
machine.

195
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:20,354
- I Iike it.
- I'm very gIad!

196
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,686
You're my first witness.

197
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:25,753
It's my first time
being a witness.

198
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:30,293
Why are you staring? You're going to
rub a hoIe through me with your eyes.

199
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:33,532
Do you reaIi<i>z</i>e
what you have just seen?

200
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,696
You bet! But teII me...

201
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:41,372
Can you Iift a waII Iike that
in a store?

202
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:45,444
- My, what a usefuI invention!
- You came to Shapk's with a recorder?

203
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,619
Forget the waII.

204
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:51,915
The most important thing is that
through waIIs I can pierce space.

205
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:57,193
I can enter time.
I can go 200, 300 years back!

206
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:01,562
You have ignored my question
about the tape recorder.

207
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,701
Darn you!

208
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:09,568
What a machine! A breakthrough in
science and technoIogy! Darn you again!

209
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:12,904
I can't wait!
Let's go back into the past

210
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:15,473
and see the ancient Moscow!

211
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,980
What are you saying, Timofeyev?

212
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:22,412
Before seeing the ancient Moscow,
get a permission from the authorities!

213
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:23,919
Just a minute!

214
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:28,750
If you mess again with the academic's
tests and stop technoIogicaI progress...

215
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,827
- I'm going to...
- CaIm down! CaIm down! I got it.

216
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:33,431
Do it.

217
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:38,603
- I'm so nervous.
- Don't chicken! I'm here!

218
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,976
...to the heavenIy abode...

219
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,453
...to the Reverend Father Superior,
Ku<i>z</i>ma...

220
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,617
Ku<i>z</i>ma...

221
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:36,860
the Tsar and Grand Duke of aII Russia...

222
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:40,396
Of aII Russia...

223
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,265
is bowing Iow.

224
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,438
Go on writing.

225
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:55,975
Look!
That's Ivan the TerribIe!

226
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:58,040
You're kidding!

227
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,187
Mamma mia!

228
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:16,193
The demons!
The demons!

229
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:18,392
The demons!

230
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,768
Away!
Stay away!

231
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:29,407
Woe is me, the sinner!
Woe is me, cursed murderer!

232
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,514
The eviI spirit!

233
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:35,412
- Wait! Where are you going? Wait!
- Go away, vanish, eviI spirit!

234
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:53,235
- Who are You caIIing?
- The poIice.

235
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:57,967
- Put down the phone.
- What? What do you mean?

236
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,575
- The phone! Put down the phone!
- Why? I won't!

237
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,180
Put down the phone, I say!

238
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,317
- Easy! Easy!
- I'II crush you, big hat!

239
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,544
Where are the demons?

240
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,888
Get them!

241
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,747
Wait! Wait!

242
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:35,533
They've bricked me up!
They've bricked me up, the demons!

243
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,640
That's what the Iife-giving cross
can do!

244
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:05,732
And where's the tsar?

245
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:11,203
You shouIdn't drink so much.

246
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,757
Where are they?

247
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,927
Hurry! Move it!

248
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,407
Why are they yeIIing?

249
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:50,275
They cannot yeII.
They're aII dead.

250
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,853
See how those dead can shoot?

251
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:01,652
- Open up, dog!
- Whom is he addressing?

252
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:04,761
- You.
- Me?!

253
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:38,622
Oh, I feeI so bad!
Bespeak again, aren't you a demon?

254
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:41,630
I toId you aIready.
I'm not a demon!

255
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:44,631
Don't dare Iying to me!
You're Iying to a tsar!

256
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:48,566
Not by human wish, but by God's wiII,
am I the tsar!

257
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,573
Very weII!
I see that you're a tsar...

258
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,769
AIas, aIas, I'm the tsar
Ivan VassiIyevich!

259
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:59,349
Send me back, magician!

260
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:02,680
I cannot! You see,
because of this poIe-axe!

261
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,954
Thank you!
The transistors have burned,

262
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,557
so I cannot send you back
untiI I buy the new ones.

263
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:15,231
- Buy them, then.
- The stores are cIosed for Iunch.

264
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,230
Oh, woe is me!

265
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:22,271
- Take it easy, Ivan VassiIyevich!
- Oh, woe is me!

266
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:27,337
- do You drink vodka?
- Yes, the anise one!

267
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:28,536
Good.

268
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,742
UnfortunateIy, there's no anise vodka.

269
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:38,685
I say, there's no anise vodka,
onIy StoIichnaya!

270
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:42,656
Drink it!

271
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:46,330
- Taste it from My cup.
- Why?

272
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,192
Go on, taste it...

273
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:51,697
You think I want to poison you?

274
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:54,799
We don't do that any more,

275
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:58,204
and in our day, you'd sooner get
poisoned with canned food, than vodka.

276
00:27:58,376 --> 00:27:59,468
Don't be afraid, drink up!

277
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,475
- Let you be heaIthy, Boyar!
- Your heaIth!

278
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:12,414
- Was it your housekeeper Who made it?
- Let's suppose so. Eat something!

279
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,925
- Who made this machine? You?
- Yes.

280
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:28,863
I had a man Iike you.
He made wings.

281
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,673
- WeII?
- What do you mean, weII?

282
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:33,936
I put him on a gun-powder barreI.
It made him fIy! Ha-ha!

283
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,544
Why did you do it?

284
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,684
No, no. I don't drink. I don't drink,
Ivan VassiIyevich. Thank you.

285
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,216
- Don't you have any respect for me?
- For God's sake, Ivan VassiIyevich!

286
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,720
- Then drink.
- Just a IittIe. Enough! Enough!

287
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:50,786
- WeII, be heaIthy!
- Your heaIth!

288
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,966
So, you Iive here?

289
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:03,206
- WeII, very cramped quarters.
- Sure, it's not Iike tsar's chambers.

290
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:06,510
- Yes, that's right.
- Anyway, it's an individuaI fIat.

291
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,509
And your woman,
is she at church?

292
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:14,344
My woman eIoped today with
her Iover, Yakin, to the Caucasus.

293
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,817
You are kidding?!
Did you send men to catch them?

294
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:21,654
When they catch them, first thing
have Yakin impaIed, and then...

295
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:24,691
Why?
They're in Iove with each other.

296
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,921
I wish them every happiness.

297
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:35,297
How kind you are!

298
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,875
Oh, God! What's going on?

299
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:41,679
I sit here, whiIe the Swedes
are taking Kem there.

300
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:44,815
Send me back, Boyar.

301
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:48,441
Go and buy those transistors.

302
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,482
Just a minute.

303
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:57,792
I'm busy.
CaII me Iater.

304
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,498
- I'm going with you.
- Right onto the street?

305
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:03,360
No, Ivan VassiIyevich,
wait for me here.

306
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:06,629
Hurry up, though, Boyar!

307
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:09,898
I'm in a hurry myseIf.
I must rescue those two, as weII.

308
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,333
What's going to happen to them?

309
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:15,536
- They'II be beheaded, that's aII.
- That's aII?

310
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,915
To heII with them!

311
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,351
Take the demons aIive!

312
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:38,626
Wait!

313
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,564
Eureka!

314
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:28,772
The tsar's garb!

315
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:32,865
Put them on.
You'II be the tsar!

316
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:34,570
No way!

317
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:37,338
Put them on, or I'II kiII you!

318
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:48,485
TaIk to me, my dear guitar,

319
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,311
My friend of seven strings.

320
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:54,917
AII my heart is open ajar,

321
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:58,694
And the night with moonIight sings.

322
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:02,763
WeII, once,
then another time,

323
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,164
And again many, many, many times.

324
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:13,170
Yes, once and again, and again
many, many times.

325
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:19,877
BIue cornfIowers in the fieId,
A Iong path Iies ahead.

326
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:27,313
My heart is torn between the guiIt
And the stars unread.

327
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:30,918
WeII, once, then another time,

328
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:35,459
And again many, many, many times.

329
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:41,261
Yes, once and again, and again
many, many times.

330
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:45,671
- WeII, how do I Iook?
- Not Iike him! You're a fake!

331
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:49,643
Let me tie up your teeth at Ieast.
You're a pain in the neck!

332
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:57,584
- the other tsar Iooks smarter.
- Don't get personaI, pIease!

333
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:03,493
Sit down!
Occupy yourseIf with matters of state.

334
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,526
Take the stick.

335
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:07,889
- Go ahead, dictate.
- Dictate what?

336
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:10,732
The tsar, repeat it,
of aII Russia...

337
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:12,870
The tsar, repeat it,
of aII Russia...

338
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:15,535
Don't repeat ''repeat it''!
Quiet!

339
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:23,679
So you say:
''The tsar and Grand Duke...''

340
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:27,542
I wrote it, comma.

341
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,719
Where the heII
is our secretary?

342
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:33,889
What's up, comrades?

343
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:37,560
I'm asking you,
what's up?

344
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:48,801
Who's that parasite who dared to
break the door in the tsar's quarters?

345
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:52,464
Did they put it here
for you to break it?

346
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,243
Go on, Your Majesty!
''...is bowing Iow...'', semicoIon.

347
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:06,222
I'm waiting for the answer
to my question!

348
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:11,224
The tsar! The tsar's here!
He's here!

349
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,259
The tsar's here!

350
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:16,232
Sit!

351
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,396
Where eIse can he be?
The tsar's in his pIace!

352
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,464
Have mercy, don't put me to death,
our kind sire!

353
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,437
The demons grabbed you,
we chased them aII over the paIace!

354
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:29,841
And, suddenIy, the demons vanished!

355
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:33,877
They were there, we don't deny it.
But they seIf-destructed.

356
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:37,686
PIease, stop this ridicuIous panic!
Who are you?

357
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:42,548
I'm Theophanes, a cIerk
at the foreign office.

358
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:45,259
AII right, Fedya.
You may stay here.

359
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:49,661
The rest, pIease, Ieave the tsar's
office. In other words, out!

360
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,565
Bark at them!

361
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:54,532
Out!

362
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:02,512
Have mercy, Sire!

363
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:05,841
Stop your somersauIts! You did it
once, you did it twice. It's enough.

364
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,254
What's the matter with you, Sire?

365
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,486
Have you taken iII?

366
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:20,264
Don't sit Iike a dummy!
I can't work here aII aIone!

367
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:22,790
I've got a toothache.

368
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,259
He's got periostitis, a gumboiI.

369
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:27,795
- And you stop pestering the tsar!
- Yes, sir.

370
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:31,533
Fedya, enough of your bowing! Are
you going to faII Iike that aII night?

371
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:37,242
- Nice to meet You.
- Don't be angry, Boyar...

372
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:40,576
but I don't recogni<i>z</i>e you.
Are you a prince?

373
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:44,312
Me? WeII, I might be.
What so strange about it?

374
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:49,451
How do you happen to be in the tsar's
quarters? You weren't here before.

375
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:54,762
- Oh, Sire, who is he?
- He's a friend of Anton Shpak's.

376
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:56,789
What a fooI!

377
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:02,864
The tsar says that I'm Prince
MiIosIavsky. Are you satisfied?

378
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:07,209
- Oh my! Stay away!
- What's the matter? What is it?

379
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:10,939
- You've been executed!
- That's news to me!

380
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:17,311
By the tsar's order, you were hanged
on your own gate three days ago.

381
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:27,286
WeII, thanks!
I was hanged by your order.

382
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:29,963
HeIp me out, or we'II screw it.

383
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:32,698
Why don't you say something, bastard?

384
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:36,565
Oh, now I remember!
It was not I who was hanged.

385
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:39,241
What was his first name, the one
whom they hanged?

386
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:42,640
- Vanka the Robber.
- You see? And I'm George.

387
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:46,305
That bandit was just my namesake.
Am I right?

388
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,618
Am I right?

389
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:50,515
PIease...

390
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,559
Why are they shouting there?
Fedya, go and find out.

391
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:56,886
Yes, sir.

392
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:02,892
The tsar!
The tsar!

393
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:07,700
Go! Go! Score! Score!

394
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:12,204
The common peopIe wish to see their
tsar who was saved. They're rejoicing.

395
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:14,401
Oh, no, it's out of the question.

396
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:17,545
We have no time for that.
We'II rejoice Iater.

397
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:23,714
They have to be sent away at once,
understand?

398
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:27,786
StiII wouIdn't say anything, damn him!

399
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:33,856
- Fedya, I hope there's no war going?
- Of course, there is, my benefactor.

400
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,996
The Swedes are biting us, the Khan of
Crimea pIays nasty on I<i>z</i>yum Road.

401
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:39,893
- You don't say!
- Yes.

402
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,937
- Why do You Let them?
- Have mercy, Sire!

403
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,439
Get up, Fyodor.

404
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:51,777
I don't bIame you...
Sit down.

405
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,317
Write down the tsar's edict.

406
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:58,613
I order
to send an army

407
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:03,893
to I<i>z</i>yum Road
and rout the Khan of Crimea.

408
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:07,324
- Period.
- Period.

409
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:14,697
Sign it, our great tsar.

410
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:18,430
I have no right to sign
historic documents.

411
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:26,574
No, I have no right to sign...

412
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:38,424
Acting for the tsar, I. Bunsha.

413
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:40,825
Here, Fedya.

414
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:43,659
And teII them
not to hurry back.

415
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:47,270
TeII them to capture Ka<i>z</i>an on their
way back, not to go there twice.

416
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:52,341
How come? Ka<i>z</i>an is ours.
We've taken it Iong ago.

417
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,670
- ReaIIy?
- Sure.

418
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,813
You were too hasty to do it.
AII right, aII right, then.

419
00:41:56,981 --> 00:42:00,576
Since it's aIready taken, Iet it be.
Why give it back?

420
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:07,884
WeII, go!

421
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,761
And in five minutes I don't want to
see either hide or hair of them here!

422
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:19,693
Mount your horses!

423
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:21,901
Start a song!

424
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:33,449
EarIy in the spring,
By a fir-tree aII green,

425
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:36,982
Vanyusha's bidding fareweII to his
Iove.

426
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:40,790
CIad in a shirt of maiI,
He's saying to his gaI:

427
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:44,694
''Don't cry, Marusya, don't cry,
my dove.''

428
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:48,490
Marusya says nothing, onIy weeps,

429
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:50,257
Her sorrow

430
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:52,731
HoIds her heart in grips.

431
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:57,771
Drop, drop, drop! Marusya's eyes,
so dear,

432
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:00,603
Drop the tears right onto his spear.

433
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:04,439
Drop, drop, drop! Marusya's eyes,
so dear,

434
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:08,311
Drop a sea of tears,

435
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:10,783
Drop-drop-drop
Right onto his spear.

436
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:17,618
In winter, coId 'n' severe,
Again under the fir-tree,

437
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:21,796
Vanyusha's being greeted by his Iove.

438
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:25,561
CIad in a shirt of maiI,
He's saying to his gaI:

439
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:29,204
''I've come to you, I'm back, my dove.''

440
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:33,204
Marusya is so happy, she weeps,

441
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,811
Like a psaItery,
HerjoyfuI heartjust sweeps.

442
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:41,411
Drop, drop, drop! Marusya's eyes,
so dear,

443
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,417
Drop the tears right onto his spear.

444
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:48,892
Drop, drop, drop! Marusya's eyes,
so dear,

445
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:51,623
drop so sweet a tear...

446
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:53,291
Drop, drop

447
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:55,758
Right onto his spear.

448
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:06,242
Drop, drop, drop!

449
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:15,213
Marusya is so happy, she weeps

450
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:19,378
Like a psaItery,
HerjoyfuI heartjust sweeps.

451
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,817
WeII, we got things going!

452
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,587
Why doesn't the inventor turn
his time machine back?

453
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:29,392
- What a scandaI awaits me at home!
- Why?

454
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,559
- I didn't teII UIyuana where I went.
- Oh, yes, of course.

455
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:38,338
We couIdn't care Iess,
We couIdn't care Iess,

456
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,876
Though owIs and woIves
Make us reaI wuss...

457
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:47,746
AIexander Sergeyevich! I'm sorry
to bother you during a famiIy crisis.

458
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:51,978
Did Ivan VassiIyevich drop by?
They're Iooking for him everywhere.

459
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:56,289
We couIdn't care Iess...
We firmIy beIieve...

460
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:06,893
CLOSED FOR INVENTORY

461
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:18,305
CLOSED FOR REDECORATION

462
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,556
What a scoundreI!

463
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:05,521
I shouIdn't have confessed
to this saintIy man!

464
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:10,600
Shurik, are you home?

465
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:13,860
Shurik!

466
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:25,381
Shurik!

467
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,427
What is that?

468
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:52,998
Oh, I've taken the bag of that
bastard, Yakin.

469
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:54,775
FILM STUDIO

470
00:46:57,881 --> 00:47:01,339
First, this hystericaI woman
made a scene on the set,

471
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:07,253
and then she mixed up our suitcases.
AII this just an hour before our pIane!

472
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:11,292
Karp SaveIyevich!
I can't beIieve how Iucky I am.

473
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:24,702
Wait for me and I'II be back.

474
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:37,878
HeIIo? Anyuta, you won't beIieve it!

475
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:41,214
I'm fIying to Gagry
with Yakin.

476
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:45,191
Zinaida MikhaiIovna, I think
you reaIi<i>z</i>e

477
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:49,396
that it's aII over between us
after what you've done at the studio.

478
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:52,399
Karp SaveIyevich,
you're a scoundreI!

479
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:55,697
PIease, return my bag, and here's
yours.

480
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:59,640
- I hope that aII My things are in it?
- What?

481
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:05,307
Oh, you bastard! You jerk!

482
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:10,350
I Ieft my husband, that saintIy man
with aII the accommodations,

483
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:12,746
a genius, an inventor,

484
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:15,288
for this scoundreI...

485
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:18,360
My goodness, such briIIiant Iines!

486
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,792
You haven't heard reaI Iines yet!

487
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:23,424
And two hours before our Ieaving,

488
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:27,161
I find him with some witch,

489
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:30,567
whom he's hoIding by her hand,

490
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:35,709
and behaving
Iike a two-bitjerk.

491
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,881
We were rehearsing a scene.

492
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:42,375
This is my professionaI duty.
Profession de foi.

493
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,816
Enough! I'm fed up!

494
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,690
I'm Ieaving you

495
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:51,954
for director Budimir Kosoy
and his production of ''Boris Godunov''.

496
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:54,696
Kosoy is a fake.

497
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:59,258
And you're a faiIure!
For him, I'm going to pIay a tsarina.

498
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:02,735
Kosoy hasn't yet found anyone
for the part of Ivan the TerribIe.

499
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,500
What?
No Ivan the TerribIe?

500
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:09,737
- But I've aIready rehearsed with him!
- Where?

501
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:13,349
Here!
Right in this room!

502
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:16,314
And who's pIaying Tsar Boris?
Who?

503
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,184
What Tsar Boris?

504
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:23,192
- Boriska?
- What is it?

505
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:26,954
- Boriska is to become a tsar?
- What? Are you reaIIy rehearsing?

506
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:31,590
That's how he, sIy fox, is paying
for the good I've done him?

507
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:35,303
He wants to be a tsar
and take aII tsardom in his hand!

508
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,804
Death, that's what he deserves!

509
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:42,541
Oh, my God, what a character!
Bravo! Bravo!

510
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:45,711
PIease, go on!

511
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:49,913
Why did you hurt this Boyar woman,
you IowIy man?

512
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:53,984
It's great! It's ama<i>z</i>ing!
He's a genius!

513
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:57,885
Listen, I can't recogni<i>z</i>e you in your
makeup. Who are you?

514
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:00,795
Sergey Bondarchuk?
No.

515
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:04,734
Oh, you're Yuri NikuIin!
No, no, no.

516
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:09,666
Oh, my God!

517
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:14,308
Innokenty Smoktunovsky!

518
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:16,838
Kesha!

519
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,985
Why didn't you teII me?

520
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:26,483
- You vagabond, you viIe shrimp!
- Are you cra<i>z</i>y?

521
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:29,825
There, get it,
son of a bitch!

522
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:33,228
Oh, my God!

523
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:36,866
You scoundreI! Son of a bitch!
Damned aduIterer!

524
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:39,433
He is a reaI tsar!

525
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:44,496
HeIp! Somebody! CaII the poIice!

526
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:47,902
On your knees, you worm!

527
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:51,606
I've caught you, Yakin! AduIterer
and son of a bitch!

528
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:56,376
Pray, son of a bitch!
This is your Iast prayer!

529
00:50:56,787 --> 00:51:00,814
- Oh, you're rehearsing?
- Yes, we're rehearsing.

530
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:05,959
What do you mean, rehearsing?
CaII the poIice!

531
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:09,459
- Where are You going?
- I'm here. I'm here.

532
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:11,826
You act very weII!

533
00:51:12,035 --> 00:51:15,232
And the tsar Iooks very authentic...

534
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:18,941
He Iooks just Iike Bunsha.

535
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:25,707
I've been robbed, Zinaida MikhaiIovna.
I'm waiting for the poIice with dogs.

536
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:28,010
Who do you beIong to?

537
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:32,318
Excuse me, comrade actor,
but what do you mean, ''beIong''?

538
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:35,320
- Whose serf are You?
- Sorry, but I don't understand you.

539
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,489
A very stupid serf!

540
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:42,256
Excuse me, but why do you keep
caIIing me a serf?

541
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:45,458
- Where Did You get that word?
- It's from the part he's pIaying.

542
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:48,797
That part is denigrating!
PIease, don't appIy it to me!

543
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:52,867
Oh, God! Some apartment house!
They rob you, they caII you names!

544
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:56,240
We'II never win the honorary titIe of
a house of cuItured communaI Iiving.

545
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:58,807
This is an outrage! An outrage!

546
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:03,418
WeII, Iascivious shrimp, beg the Boyar
woman if she giveth you Iife or death!

547
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:06,747
- Life.
- Life. Life.

548
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:08,891
Be mercifuI, O great tsar!

549
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:10,552
Life?

550
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:15,555
Be it your way.

551
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:24,634
Listen to me, Karp,
but, pIease, don't get excited.

552
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,843
This is the reaI Ivan the TerribIe!

553
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:33,278
Do you remember I was teIIing you
about the time machine?

554
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:36,749
WeII, Shurik did succeed with
that experiment!

555
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:47,695
- But he couId have kiIIed me!
- And wouId have done good!

556
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:50,593
It's cra<i>z</i>y!

557
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:55,668
What do you mean, Ivan the TerribIe?
He's been Iong dead!

558
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:58,736
- Who's dead?
- I didn't mean you.

559
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:01,738
I mean the other one,
the one who's been dead...

560
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:13,553
- Did You seduce the Boyar woman?
- Yes, I did.

561
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:18,554
I am he... that Iiveth...

562
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:23,659
What do you mean, you Iiveth,
viIe dog? Look at yourseIf!

563
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:24,834
Liveth!

564
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:28,493
- HeIp me. Say something in SIavonic.
- Thy!

565
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:32,608
Thy... thy cherub.

566
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:35,409
Your ExceIIency, have mercy!

567
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:38,004
You have misunderstood me.

568
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:41,746
How can I understand you,
if you don't say anything?

569
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:44,885
I don't know foreign Ianguages,
your highness.

570
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:49,450
- do You Iove this Boyar woman?
- I'm cra<i>z</i>y about her!

571
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:54,622
Look at her! Beauteous to behoId,

572
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:58,564
crimson in her Iips, crescents in her
brows!

573
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:02,234
- What more do you want, dog?
- Nothing!

574
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:05,374
Then marry her, fooI!
The prince is Ietting her go.

575
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:07,874
I'm asking for your hand,
Zinaida MikhaiIovna!

576
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:14,511
HeIIo? GaIya? You're going to faII
down! I've got great news!

577
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:17,244
Yakin has Ieft his witch,

578
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,479
and we're going to Gagry.

579
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:24,385
WeII, you sinning beard! ShouId I
hear that you've done something...

580
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,824
- I swear!
- Don't interrupt the tsar!

581
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:30,956
- Yes, Sire!
- I'm giving you one of my coats.

582
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:36,931
- Thank him! Thank him!
- Thou art... I thank thee humbIy!

583
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,372
Sire!

584
00:54:41,544 --> 00:54:43,705
You can't stay here
Iooking Iike this!

585
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:47,677
PeopIe might think I don't know what.

586
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:53,253
Oh, God AImighty!
I forgot where I am, O Lord!

587
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:54,690
I've forgotten everything!

588
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:58,692
You must change your cIothes,
Ivan VassiIyevich!

589
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:03,632
Oh, the demons' garb!
A temptation...

590
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:10,300
My mind is aII confused.
The coat, the Tsar Ivan the TerribIe...

591
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:14,874
Stop being so fidgety! WeII, it is
Ivan the TerribIe. So what? Big deaI!

592
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:17,542
You had better go
and heIp the tsar change.

593
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:18,874
Yes, ma'am.

594
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,782
HeIIo? Vava?
You'II never beIieve it!

595
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:26,748
Oh, my God!

596
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:33,894
He Iooks so much Iike our Bunsha!

597
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:38,632
- Pah!
- It Iooks very good on you.

598
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:41,965
- Dear Tsar, we must go.
- Perchance... we shaIt...

599
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:45,202
We have a pIane to catch.

600
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,208
Godspeed!

601
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:50,572
May we thank you for everything?

602
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:55,946
You're a very spirited man!

603
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:17,632
HeIIo? Shurochka?

604
00:56:17,807 --> 00:56:20,742
Can you imagine? Yakin
feII for me Iike a siIIy boy.

605
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:26,371
He proposed, and we're Ieaving
for our honeymoon. Many kisses.

606
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,544
Go!

607
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:39,557
Oh, how beautifuI it is!
Beauteous!

608
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:51,840
Beauteous!

609
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,341
Cigarette break!

610
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:03,819
- The Swedish Ambassador!
- What's up, Fedya?

611
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,623
The Swedish ambassador
asks for an audience.

612
00:57:42,425 --> 00:57:44,416
Bring the ambassador in.

613
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:50,830
Knit your brows! Knit your brows!

614
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,531
Der grosse Konig,

615
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:33,639
Des Schwedischen Konigreichs sende
mich,

616
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:37,379
seinen treuen Diener,

617
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:42,947
<i>z</i>u Ihnen, C<i>z</i>ar and Grande Duc

618
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,779
Ivan VassiIyevich...

619
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:49,655
usarussa.

620
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:53,258
- This foreign tourist speaks weII!
- What exactIy does he say?

621
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:55,761
I'II be damned if I know.
Fedya!

622
00:58:57,667 --> 00:59:00,500
- We need an interpreter.
- We had one. He was German.

623
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:03,135
He got drunk as a Iord
when he had to transIate.

624
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:06,637
- So We cooked him in boiIed water.
- It's not the way to treat interpreters.

625
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,906
Schwedete armie erobern hut.

626
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:13,372
Answer something.
See, the man goes out of his way.

627
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:15,841
HitIer kaput!

628
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:19,719
Go on, Mister Ambassador.
We absoIuteIy agree with you.

629
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:23,789
- Kemska district.
- Right. AbsoIuteIy.

630
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:28,628
AbsoIuteIy.

631
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:33,794
Look, comrade.
Excuse us for a minute.

632
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:38,868
I wouId Iike to know
what he wants, in generaI terms.

633
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:41,769
It's very simpIe.

634
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:45,874
They want Kemsk Region. They went to
war, so, they say, give it to us.

635
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:48,547
What? Kemsk Region?

636
00:59:48,952 --> 00:59:52,547
Ja, Kemska rejion. Ja, ja...

637
00:59:53,456 --> 00:59:56,391
Take it if you want it! Oh, God!
I thought it was something important.

638
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:59,892
- But you can't do it, benefactor.
- The tsar knows what he's doing.

639
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:04,262
Our state won't be any poorer for it.
Take it! Take it!

640
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:08,794
Have mercy, our great tsar,
and aIIow me to speak.

641
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:15,877
What are you doing, son of a bitch?
Some impostor squandering our Iands!

642
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,338
We shaII never have enough regions
for you!

643
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:20,846
So whadda I say my king?

644
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:26,217
Say your king
my warm greetings.

645
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:28,580
Whadda about Kemsk region?

646
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:32,453
Such questions, my dear ambassador,
are not decided at the drop of a hat.

647
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:36,461
We have to consuIt with comrades.
Come back in a few days.

648
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:40,466
Yes, by the way, here's a IittIe
souvenir for you from me.

649
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:45,440
Here!

650
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:58,618
WeII, auf Wiedersehen!
Goodbye! Au revoir! In short, ciao!

651
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:07,227
Everyone can go!

652
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:12,367
The guards can go, too.

653
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:15,202
The guards can go.

654
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:27,907
Why are you crawIing, oId chap?

655
01:01:28,618 --> 01:01:31,246
The ambassador has Iost his chest
decoration.

656
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:37,257
He shouIdn't be so absent-minded. One
shouId watch his things when in a room.

657
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:41,429
Why are you staring at me?

658
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:44,600
- do You think I took it?
- No, of course not!

659
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:46,829
You didn't take it, did you?

660
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:50,897
Maybe it has sIid under the throne?

661
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:53,372
No.

662
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:56,305
WeII, then nothing can be done.

663
01:01:56,479 --> 01:01:58,003
What a misfortune!

664
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:08,554
I am again tormented by some
troubIing doubts.

665
01:02:08,758 --> 01:02:12,524
Shpak's tape recorder,
the ambassador's medaI...

666
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:14,595
What are you driving at?

667
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:18,325
I'm asking you, you tsar's mug,
what are you hinting at?

668
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:22,368
The Tartar Prince Yedigey is here
to see the tsar.

669
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:25,234
No.
That's too much.

670
01:02:27,276 --> 01:02:30,006
CaIIing hours are over.
We have a Iunch break.

671
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:34,815
The tsar wishes to refect.

672
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:52,393
- I must be dreaming!
- Just a minute.

673
01:02:52,568 --> 01:02:56,732
- Who's going to pay for this banquet?
- In any case, not us.

674
01:02:57,006 --> 01:02:58,769
Fedya, what is in there?

675
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:01,938
Hare's kidneys,

676
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:06,204
pike heads with garIic.
BIack caviar.

677
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:07,840
Red caviar.

678
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:11,220
And from overseas...

679
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:15,387
EggpIant caviar!

680
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:17,957
BeautifuI!

681
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:21,888
- WeII, tsar, Iet's drink.
- Let's drink.

682
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:50,759
Beauteous!

683
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:54,419
I Iook for him aII over the house, and
here's he, in someone eIse's fIat.

684
01:03:54,597 --> 01:03:56,565
Why don't you Iook me in the eye?

685
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:58,996
Ivan VassiIyevich,
I've been burgIari<i>z</i>ed!

686
01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:03,733
Everything I've got by working
tireIessIy, everything is gone!

687
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:07,238
Oh, Iook at you!
You're bIind drunk!

688
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:10,675
You don't Iook Iike yourseIf!
What on earth did you put on yourseIf?

689
01:04:10,913 --> 01:04:14,872
- Imported tape recorder, suede jacket...
- He's drunk!

690
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:16,684
There's nothing Ieft!

691
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:19,946
He can't stand on his feet!
Where are you going?

692
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:24,848
Oh, God! What's going on?
Go home now, aIcohoIic!

693
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:27,996
Leave me aIone, oId woman,
I'm being sad.

694
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:31,690
OId woman? You jerk!

695
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:33,902
I'm five years younger than you!

696
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,528
Let's go home, now!

697
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:39,000
You are a witch!

698
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:41,574
HeIp!

699
01:04:41,944 --> 01:04:45,209
Ivan VassiIyevich, caIm down.

700
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:51,285
- Witch!
- To be absoIuteIy honest, yes.

701
01:04:52,622 --> 01:04:55,716
- And What do You want?
- Dear Ivan VassiIyevich,

702
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:58,520
that's the Iist of stoIen things.

703
01:04:58,694 --> 01:05:03,757
Two tape recorders, two movie cameras,
two cigarette cases. PIease!

704
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:06,833
Is it the way to hand in a petition
to the tsar?

705
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:10,434
What do you mean? Stop your
hooIiganism!

706
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:16,874
You and your drunken tricks! I'II fiIe
a coIIective compIaint against you!

707
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:20,215
I see you never stop, Iackey!

708
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:24,811
HeIIo? Is that a psychiatric ward?

709
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:30,314
My husband has got a deIirium tremens.
He attacks peopIe with a knife.

710
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:34,994
- Stop! Take the knife away!
- The knife!

711
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:38,959
Just Iook at our activist!
He's an armed bandit!

712
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:41,732
- LowIy trash!
- You're trash yourseIf!

713
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:43,369
Lackey!

714
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:45,905
The poIice wiII decide who's a Iackey
here!

715
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:47,971
Is it the poIice?

716
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:52,278
- Wait! He's not Bunsha!
- What do you mean, not Bunsha?

717
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:55,713
He's Ivan the TerribIe. The reaI one.

718
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,455
I'm busy. CaII me Iater.

719
01:06:10,933 --> 01:06:14,528
- Oh, my God! What's going on?
- I reveaIed a big secret to you.

720
01:06:14,704 --> 01:06:17,366
I beg you to promise that you won't
teII anybody.

721
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:20,633
Of course! You have my word.

722
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:24,541
- Thank You.
- Don't mention it.

723
01:06:28,517 --> 01:06:30,883
HeIIo? The poIice?

724
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:34,585
That's Shpak speaking, who's been
burgIari<i>z</i>ed.

725
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:37,953
No, it's not about the robbery.
We've got something more weird here.

726
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:42,253
Engineer Timofeyev has a Iive
tsar in his apartment.

727
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:47,326
No, I don't drink.
With a dagger, coId steeI...

728
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:50,904
I'm giving you my word of honor!

729
01:06:51,707 --> 01:06:52,969
I'II be waiting.

730
01:06:59,882 --> 01:07:03,283
I can imagine how they fight now
on I<i>z</i>yum Road.

731
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:08,456
Fedya, what are you doing there, by
the kidneys? Come here, don't be shy.

732
01:07:08,624 --> 01:07:11,957
Here!
Let's drink to friendship!

733
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:17,723
Listen, oId chap, do they accept
jeweIry at your pawn shop?

734
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:22,666
- We can arrange it.
- Let's drink.

735
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:27,239
The tsarina is here, Sire.
She wants to see you.

736
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:35,314
Fedya, go back to the kidneys! It was a
bad move. You don't Iook Iike a tsar.

737
01:07:35,484 --> 01:07:39,750
What? Whoa! Whoa!
Who are you taIking to, Iackey?

738
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:50,597
Dear tsarina! I'm so gIad!
Nice meeting you! My pIeasure.

739
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:54,860
HeIIo, I'm the tsar. Nice to meet you.
How do you do, I'm the tsar...

740
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:59,201
Very pIeased, I'm the tsar. Nice to
meet you, I'm the tsar. Very pIeased.

741
01:08:01,477 --> 01:08:05,208
PIease, come to our tabIe.

742
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:09,706
This way, pIease.
PIease...

743
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:12,587
Haven't we met before?

744
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:15,246
- What are you saying, shit?
- Whoa! Whoa!

745
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:19,360
Hey! Waiter!
One order of kidneys for the tsarina.

746
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:21,696
Excuse me for a minute.

747
01:08:22,565 --> 01:08:26,934
- Sorry, your name, pIease?
- Why, I'm Marfa VassiIyevna.

748
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:30,530
WonderfuI! Enchanting!

749
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:34,571
Marfa VassiIyevna, how enchanting!
A gIass of cardamom vodka?

750
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:37,541
- Oh, no!
- Why? PIease, don't refuse.

751
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:39,981
Your heaIth!

752
01:08:43,586 --> 01:08:46,714
WeII, everyone keeps saying: tsar,
tsar...

753
01:08:47,356 --> 01:08:50,223
You think, Marfa VassiIyevna,
it's easy to be a tsar?

754
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:52,758
No, on the contrary!

755
01:08:53,429 --> 01:08:57,263
Every working man has two days off,
and we, the tsars, have no days off.

756
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:00,162
And our working hours are not fixed.

757
01:09:00,769 --> 01:09:05,331
PIease, eat, Margarita VassiIyevna.
Everything has been paid for.

758
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:11,369
You know, a tsar's job is so unheaIthy
that we shouId be given free miIk.

759
01:09:11,614 --> 01:09:13,912
They wrote it in the HeaIth Maga<i>z</i>ine

760
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:17,145
that the nervous ceIIs are never
restored.

761
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:21,415
You work and work, our great tsar,
just Iike a bee!

762
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:27,451
Margo, you aIone understand me!

763
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:33,831
- One more gIass to Go with a pike head?
- Oh, no! No!

764
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:39,396
TeII me, pIease, do you have
private rooms here?

765
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:42,370
- I see you're dead drunk!
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

766
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:46,242
Why don't you pIay, maestro?
Strike up a song!

767
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:56,387
That's not a big bIack cIoud coming...

768
01:09:57,927 --> 01:09:58,859
A cIoud!

769
01:10:00,763 --> 01:10:05,632
That's not a thunderstorm striking...

770
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:10,398
A thunderstorm!

771
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:18,507
That's the tsar of Crimea, a viIe dog...

772
01:10:21,417 --> 01:10:22,679
A dog!

773
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:31,286
What do you mean, a dog?

774
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:34,558
How dare you sing such songs
about a tsar?

775
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:38,659
You got out of hand here, without me.
What kind of a repertoire is that?

776
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:43,301
You ought to sing songs for the masses,
something contemporary.

777
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:46,771
Like... how does it go?
TraIi-vaIi, tiIi-tiIi.

778
01:10:46,942 --> 01:10:50,605
We're not the tiIi-tiIi,
we're not the traIi-vaIi.

779
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:53,043
CooI it, Vanya. We'II do everything.

780
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,745
Excuse me, what's your name again?

781
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:59,615
- I'm Marfa VassiIyevna!
- Yes, of course, Marfa.

782
01:11:00,489 --> 01:11:03,458
Oh, Marfusha! The night is stiII young!

783
01:11:03,959 --> 01:11:06,519
Give us a Iine,
and we'II pick it up.

784
01:11:06,695 --> 01:11:08,560
Wait! Quiet!

785
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,899
AII of a sudden,

786
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:14,564
Out of the bIue,

787
01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:18,739
Love knocked down

788
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:21,343
Upon my door.

789
01:11:21,577 --> 01:11:27,607
Is that it? Is that you?
I couIdn't hope for anything more.

790
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:31,649
Snow was faIIing, dawn after dawn,

791
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,616
Days were rainy and mean.

792
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:38,391
So many years, why were you gone?

793
01:11:38,827 --> 01:11:43,264
Where have you ever been?

794
01:11:45,367 --> 01:11:49,599
Like in a dream, the doorjust creaked,

795
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:53,566
And suddenIy, aII made sense.

796
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:56,609
Fate pIayed tricks. Fate intrigued.

797
01:11:56,879 --> 01:11:59,370
And here's our meeting, hence.

798
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:01,878
I fro<i>z</i>e at sea, traveIed by train.

799
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:04,412
I know it was not in vain.

800
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:09,681
No, it was not in vain,
It was not for nothing.

801
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:15,790
AII has happened, aII came true.
Nobody knows, how.

802
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:21,895
How couId I Iive aII this through?
It's just incredibIe! Wow!

803
01:12:22,538 --> 01:12:27,566
If you wait and take it in,
whatever ever Iies in store...

804
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:31,207
Then you can get it, what you dreamed
for,

805
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:34,645
And go hope for more.

806
01:12:34,983 --> 01:12:36,678
Everybody dance!

807
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:41,388
Like in a dream, the doorjust creaked,

808
01:12:41,623 --> 01:12:44,922
And, suddenIy, aII made sense.

809
01:12:45,294 --> 01:12:47,990
Fate pIayed tricks. Fate intrigued.

810
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:50,525
And here's our meeting, hence.

811
01:12:50,799 --> 01:12:53,290
I fro<i>z</i>e at sea, traveIed by train.

812
01:12:53,469 --> 01:12:55,801
I know it was not in vain.

813
01:12:55,971 --> 01:13:00,704
No, it was not in vain,
It was not for nothing.

814
01:14:14,349 --> 01:14:19,412
A mutiny in the army!
They say that the tsar's not reaI!

815
01:14:29,765 --> 01:14:32,563
My dear autocrat, we're done in!

816
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:36,302
I demand that the banquet go on!

817
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:41,231
Why are we done in? Why?

818
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:16,375
This way!

819
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:24,376
Come on, Prince, hurry up!
Send me back!

820
01:15:24,586 --> 01:15:27,555
Everything wiII be ready in 3 minutes.

821
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:52,570
Wait a bit, Ivan VassiIyevich. You'd
better change into your tsar's cIothes.

822
01:15:52,915 --> 01:15:54,473
Damn!

823
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:15,828
Do you smoke?

824
01:16:18,473 --> 01:16:21,169
You don't? Good.
I don't smoke either.

825
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:23,944
So teII me, who are you?

01:16:35,624 --> 01:16:37,387

831
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,894

834
01:16:57,479 --> 01:17:01,279
- What am I accused of, Boyar?
- You'II meet your boyars in the can!

835
01:17:01,683 --> 01:17:04,811
- Was it you who busted Shpak's pIace?
- Shpak's?

836
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:08,682
I took Ka<i>z</i>an, I took Astrakhan,

837
01:17:08,857 --> 01:17:12,190
I took ReveI,
but never Shpak.

838
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:14,954
There he is! You're bagged!
It serves you right, drunkard!

839
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:18,789
-What's up, foIks? Who are you?
-Lieutenant, I'm this aIcohoIic's wife!

840
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:22,494
You're Iying!
How can you be my wife, oId woman?

841
01:17:22,704 --> 01:17:26,299
See? He got drunk out of his wits!
He can't recogni<i>z</i>e his own wife!

842
01:17:26,775 --> 01:17:29,744
I had to caII the psychiatric ward.

843
01:17:30,012 --> 01:17:34,210
Oh, that's what it's aII about!
That's why aII these ravings.

844
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:38,375
He took Ka<i>z</i>an. He took Astrakhan.
He caIIs himseIf Ivan the TerribIe.

845
01:17:38,587 --> 01:17:40,817
It's deIirium tremens.
A typicaI case.

846
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:44,288
What's the patient's reaI name?

847
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:48,221
- Bunsha, Ivan VassiIyevich.
- You're Iying, witch!

848
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,397
I hate him!

849
01:17:51,433 --> 01:17:52,559
Attention!

850
01:17:53,268 --> 01:17:54,860
Get ready!

01:18:04,312 --> 01:18:06,405

- AII right. You'II never beIieve it!

858
01:19:41,376 --> 01:19:46,905
The poIice wiII beIieve it! You wiII
answer for your anti-sociaI experiments!

859
01:19:48,884 --> 01:19:50,909
Sire!
Just a minute!

860
01:20:00,762 --> 01:20:05,392
Why do you have poIice at your door,
comrade scientist?

861
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,000
There was a burgIary at your friend
Shpak's today.

862
01:20:08,436 --> 01:20:10,461
ReaIIy?

863
01:20:14,776 --> 01:20:19,543
- We detained One more.
- No, not detained!

864
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:24,247
Not detained. I was on my way
to make a voIuntary confession.

865
01:20:24,419 --> 01:20:28,822
I'm deIighted to hand myseIf in to my
dear poIice. I set on it aII my hopes.

866
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:32,585
- Who are you?
- Bunsha, Ivan VassiIyevich.

867
01:20:34,396 --> 01:20:37,456
So you insist that you're Ivan
VassiIyevich Bunsha?

868
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:39,600
Your ID, pIease.

869
01:20:40,635 --> 01:20:44,332
- I forgot it at home.
- Who can corroborate your statement?

870
01:20:45,774 --> 01:20:50,438
WeII, anybody! You may ask my wife,
UIyana. She wiII confirm it.

871
01:20:50,645 --> 01:20:52,806
WeII, weII, weII.

872
01:20:53,648 --> 01:20:56,344
What did you want to make
a voIuntary confession about?

873
01:20:56,785 --> 01:21:00,881
I confess that against my wiII, under
the compuIsion of Prince MiIosIavsky,

874
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:03,587
I acted temporariIy as a tsar.

875
01:21:03,992 --> 01:21:06,256
A tsar?
You are a tsar, too?

876
01:21:06,461 --> 01:21:08,952
Yes, a tsar.
Ivan VassiIyevich the TerribIe.

877
01:21:09,397 --> 01:21:13,197
You're Iying, dog!
I am the tsar!

878
01:21:14,836 --> 01:21:16,394
HooIigan!

879
01:21:17,505 --> 01:21:21,305
Everything I've got by working
tireIessIy, everything is gone!

880
01:21:21,776 --> 01:21:24,904
Three tape recorders,
three imported movie cameras,

881
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:31,914
three home-made cigarette cases,
a suede jacket... Three jackets!

882
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:37,791
And they want to be awarded the titIe
of a house of cuItured communaI Iiving!

883
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:43,657
UIyana Andreyevna, teII us again
who he is.

884
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:47,759
I've aIready toId you!

885
01:21:47,969 --> 01:21:50,597
My husband, Ivan VassiIyevich Bunsha.

886
01:21:50,772 --> 01:21:54,469
- They'II cure you, aIcohoIic.
- Fine! Then who is this?

887
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:02,376
- Impostor!
- You're an impostor yourseIf! Got it?

888
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:05,382
- So, who is he?
-My husband! Ivan VassiIyevich Bunsha.

889
01:22:06,321 --> 01:22:11,657
They wiII cure you, too.

890
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:19,394
- It turns out you've got 2 husbands?
- So it turns out.

891
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:21,466
And they're both Bunshas?

892
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:25,937
Yes, both of them.

893
01:22:29,311 --> 01:22:31,575
You'II be cured.

894
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:34,644
And you'II be cured.

895
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:40,421
And I'II be cured, too.

896
01:22:41,356 --> 01:22:45,486
What you toId me is grandiose!
You're such a vaIuabIe eyewitness!

897
01:22:45,927 --> 01:22:48,919
If I were you,
I'd put a dissertation in the can.

898
01:22:49,998 --> 01:22:52,796
I ain't in no hurry.
I can end up in the can any time.

899
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:06,603
Is that it? Is that you?
I couIdn't hope for anything more.

900
01:23:08,249 --> 01:23:10,615
UIyana Andreyevna,
I was faithfuI to you.

901
01:23:10,785 --> 01:23:14,619
The tsarina tried to seduce me,
but I didn't give in. I swear!

902
01:23:21,463 --> 01:23:25,194
- MiIosIavsky was aImost in our hands!
- George MiIosIavsky?

903
01:23:25,367 --> 01:23:27,699
- Yes! Arrest him!
- Right.

904
01:23:29,537 --> 01:23:30,561
Wait!

905
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:35,002
HoId on! Get him!
Catch MiIosIavsky!

906
01:24:07,976 --> 01:24:11,207
I was absoIuteIy sure
that I had sent you back.

907
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:15,307
Hurry up, Prince.
Get your machine working.

908
01:24:15,583 --> 01:24:19,451
- Where have You been aII this time?
-The poIice bagged me. Framing me up.

909
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:28,558
They're after me, Prince!
Hurry up! Hurry! Oh, my God!

910
01:24:30,832 --> 01:24:33,426
Run, Ivan VassiIyevich!

911
01:24:36,371 --> 01:24:39,306
- Hurry, Ivan VassiIyevich!
- Yes, I'm coming!

912
01:24:39,474 --> 01:24:41,567
Oh, God, forgive me my sins!

913
01:24:42,844 --> 01:24:44,675
EviI spirit!

914
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:51,280
- FareweII, Prince!
- Good Iuck! Don't think iII of me.

915
01:25:18,012 --> 01:25:20,742
- It's outrageous!
- You put out eIectricity again!

916
01:25:20,915 --> 01:25:23,850
- He's taunting us!
- We're going to compIain!

917
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:27,519
Oh, you're aIready out of the asyIum?

918
01:25:27,755 --> 01:25:30,622
- Stop your hooIiganism!
- What's the matter?

919
01:25:30,825 --> 01:25:32,588
That's scandaIous!

920
01:25:32,827 --> 01:25:38,288
He's wearing gIasses just for nothing!
You'II be brought to court for that!

921
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:44,496
We send them to coIIege,
and in return we're going baId!

922
01:25:46,941 --> 01:25:48,465
What was it?

923
01:25:49,043 --> 01:25:53,377
Was itjust a dream, or was it reaI?

924
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:58,343
Ivan the TerribIe... MiIosIavsky...

925
01:26:00,054 --> 01:26:02,147
Oh, I forgot. Zina has Ieft me.

926
01:26:07,428 --> 01:26:09,794
No, it's aII nonsense!

927
01:26:10,765 --> 01:26:13,256
I was just knocked out!

928
01:26:14,903 --> 01:26:16,837
And what if it's not nonsense?

929
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:20,335
My goodness!
What is going on here?

930
01:26:20,642 --> 01:26:22,610
You smoked again!

931
01:26:23,611 --> 01:26:25,602
And, of course, you didn't eat
your Iunch.

932
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:37,749
- You haven't Ieft for Gagry?
- What do you mean, Gagry?

933
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:41,562
You're going cra<i>z</i>y
with your machine!

934
01:26:47,502 --> 01:26:49,697
Oh, how did you get yourseIf
such a bump?

935
01:26:52,707 --> 01:26:56,199
Zina, teII me the truth.

936
01:26:57,011 --> 01:27:00,208
- Where have You been?
- At a rehearsaI.

937
01:27:00,415 --> 01:27:01,507
AII right...

938
01:27:01,749 --> 01:27:06,243
Give me a straight answer.
Are you in Iove with Yakin?

939
01:27:07,789 --> 01:27:12,522
- What Yakin? What is it with You?
- Don't Iie to me. He's your director.

940
01:27:14,295 --> 01:27:16,889
We have no director by that name.

941
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:21,768
- is it true?
- I swear.

942
01:27:22,837 --> 01:27:23,826
Hurray!

943
01:27:46,227 --> 01:27:47,854
Ciao!

944
01:27:48,363 --> 01:27:50,888
Thank you for your attention!

945
01:27:51,232 --> 01:27:52,961
The End
