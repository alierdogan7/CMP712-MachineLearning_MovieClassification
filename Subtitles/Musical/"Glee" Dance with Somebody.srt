60
00:02:37,398 --> 00:02:38,599
I mean, don't
get me wrong--

61
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,633
I will always love Whitney, too,

62
00:02:39,684 --> 00:02:41,285
but you'd think,

63
00:02:41,352 --> 00:02:42,953
after two months,
they'd let it go.

64
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:44,071
I got this.

65
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:53,363
Is this you?
Mm-hmm.

66
00:02:53,448 --> 00:02:56,767
August 31, 1997.

67
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:58,818
I was about to start
my senior year of high school

68
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,153
when tragedy struck.

69
00:03:00,204 --> 00:03:01,672
I spent the next
eight months

70
00:03:01,756 --> 00:03:03,340
writing condolence letters
to the two princes

71
00:03:03,424 --> 00:03:05,842
and listening to "Candle
in the Wind" on constant repeat.

72
00:03:05,927 --> 00:03:08,045
Emma, I had no idea you had
such a connection to her.

73
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:09,263
I didn't.

74
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,765
I mean, every little girl
worshiped her,

75
00:03:11,832 --> 00:03:15,519
but she was just a physical
representation of my pain.

76
00:03:15,603 --> 00:03:17,354
You know, I was scared.

77
00:03:17,438 --> 00:03:18,889
It was my last year
of high school.

78
00:03:18,973 --> 00:03:20,607
No more living at home.

79
00:03:20,675 --> 00:03:22,976
I was saying good-bye
to my teachers and my friend.

80
00:03:23,027 --> 00:03:26,780
Diana dying represented
the loss of my childhood.

81
00:03:26,847 --> 00:03:28,482
So Whitney is their Diana.

82
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:29,516
Yeah, exactly.

83
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:30,784
(school bell ringing)

84
00:03:30,852 --> 00:03:32,152
<i>MERCEDES:
It was written for Diana Ross.</i>

85
00:03:32,203 --> 00:03:33,954
No, Mercedes,
you are wrong, okay?

86
00:03:34,021 --> 00:03:36,022
<i>The Bodyguard was originally
written for Barbra Streisand.</i>

87
00:03:36,074 --> 00:03:38,325
Actually, Rachel, it was
supposed to be Diana Ross--

88
00:03:38,376 --> 00:03:40,160
and Steve McQueen,
back in the '70s.

89
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:42,028
Thank you, Mr. Shue.

90
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,380
I've been doing some research

91
00:03:43,464 --> 00:03:45,582
to prepare
for this week's lesson.

92
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:46,967
Oh, my God, yes.

93
00:03:47,034 --> 00:03:48,702
It's about time we did
a Whitney tribute!

94
00:03:48,753 --> 00:03:49,753
Are we sure
that's appropriate?

95
00:03:49,837 --> 00:03:51,004
You did not just ask that.

96
00:03:51,055 --> 00:03:52,205
I just mean,
didn't Whitney

97
00:03:52,256 --> 00:03:53,724
kind of have
a lot of problems?

98
00:03:53,808 --> 00:03:56,059
She had a hard life, Sam. And?

99
00:03:56,144 --> 00:03:58,178
Look, this week isn't about
passing judgment on Whitney.

100
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:59,980
It's about celebrating
her legacy,

101
00:04:00,047 --> 00:04:01,982
honoring her memory,
her accomplishments.

102
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:03,066
Which I will happily list
for you.

103
00:04:03,151 --> 00:04:04,017
But I also
want you guys

104
00:04:04,068 --> 00:04:05,268
to use her songs

105
00:04:05,353 --> 00:04:07,053
to get underneath
your own feelings.

106
00:04:07,105 --> 00:04:11,325
To express and explore
what's really going on with you.

107
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,442
I don't get it, Mr. Shue.

108
00:04:12,527 --> 00:04:14,227
What's really going on with us?

109
00:04:14,278 --> 00:04:16,363
Well, for most of you,
these next few weeks

110
00:04:16,414 --> 00:04:17,864
will be your last
here at McKinley.

111
00:04:17,915 --> 00:04:20,951
Lots of changes
coming up, lots of...

112
00:04:21,035 --> 00:04:22,369
saying good-bye.

113
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,903
To your friends,

114
00:04:23,955 --> 00:04:25,622
to your
significant others,

115
00:04:25,707 --> 00:04:28,074
to the last four years
of your life.

116
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:30,761
For a young person,
all that transition

117
00:04:30,845 --> 00:04:32,879
can be overwhelming.

118
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,632
So it's easier to focus
on other things.

119
00:04:35,717 --> 00:04:38,585
Like not being able to say
good-bye to Whitney Houston.

120
00:04:38,636 --> 00:04:39,853
What are you talking about?

121
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,971
Santana, it's okay.

122
00:04:41,055 --> 00:04:42,272
I get it.

123
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,306
You're hanging
on to Whitney

124
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,908
because it's difficult to handle

125
00:04:44,976 --> 00:04:46,610
the upheaval in your own lives.

126
00:04:46,694 --> 00:04:48,428
We're hanging on to Whitney
because she was incredible

127
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,280
and we love her, so don't
put your baggage on us.

128
00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:52,098
RACHEL:
You guys, Mr. Shue's
attempt to understand us,

129
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,867
though misguided,
doesn't matter.

130
00:04:53,934 --> 00:04:55,902
What matters is that I start
rehearsing Whitney's version

131
00:04:55,953 --> 00:04:57,270
of "The Star-Spangled Banner"
immediately.

132
00:04:57,321 --> 00:04:59,373
It is the Mount Everest
of anthems.

133
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,774
KURT:
How thrilled am I

134
00:05:00,825 --> 00:05:02,275
for this week's assignment?

135
00:05:02,326 --> 00:05:04,161
I'm going to Between the Sheets
to find music.

136
00:05:04,245 --> 00:05:06,663
I got to figure out
what song I want to do.

137
00:05:06,748 --> 00:05:08,415
I could do
"So Emotional,"

138
00:05:08,466 --> 00:05:10,133
which was obviously
written for me,

139
00:05:10,218 --> 00:05:12,002
or "One Moment in Time,"

140
00:05:12,086 --> 00:05:15,005
which was also obviously
written for me.

141
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:17,057
Well, you can't
really go wrong.

142
00:05:17,124 --> 00:05:19,176
I figured I could kill two birds
with one stone.

143
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,094
I could do one
for the assignment this week,

144
00:05:21,145 --> 00:05:22,562
and then one
for my NYADA audition.

145
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,231
You'll come
with me, right?

146
00:05:24,298 --> 00:05:25,298
Well, I can't today.

147
00:05:27,802 --> 00:05:29,603
Okay. Boo.

148
00:05:29,654 --> 00:05:31,571
Well, just text me
when you're done.

149
00:05:33,357 --> 00:05:34,641
Will do.

150
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:35,975
(school bell ringing)

151
00:05:40,581 --> 00:05:42,165
Excuse me.

152
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,500
I'm so sorry
to bother you,

153
00:05:43,584 --> 00:05:44,951
but that
hippopotamus head brooch

154
00:05:45,002 --> 00:05:46,453
is awesome.

155
00:05:46,504 --> 00:05:48,154
Thanks.
That whole outfit
is amazing.

156
00:05:48,206 --> 00:05:50,424
You must get compliments
all the time.

157
00:05:50,491 --> 00:05:51,708
I don't, actually.

158
00:05:51,793 --> 00:05:52,926
Kurt Hummel.

159
00:05:52,993 --> 00:05:54,678
Chandler Kiehl.
I go to North Lima High.

160
00:05:54,762 --> 00:05:57,431
I've got an audition next week,
and I'm dying to do

161
00:05:57,498 --> 00:05:59,132
<i>"Rainbow High" from Evita,
but the guy</i>

162
00:05:59,183 --> 00:06:00,767
just said
they're sold out,

163
00:06:00,835 --> 00:06:02,335
which is a preposterous lie.

164
00:06:02,386 --> 00:06:04,104
What are you auditioning for?

165
00:06:04,171 --> 00:06:05,939
Uh, the musical theater
program at NYU.

166
00:06:06,006 --> 00:06:07,958
That's so funny.
I'm auditioning for NYADA.

167
00:06:08,025 --> 00:06:09,526
My callback's in
a couple weeks.
NYADA callback?

168
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,894
Ooh-la-la!
What song are you doing?

169
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:12,312
I'm not sure.

170
00:06:12,363 --> 00:06:15,315
Um, I have to find the perfect
Whitney Houston song.

171
00:06:15,366 --> 00:06:18,368
Oh, my God! You must do
"One Moment in Time."

172
00:06:18,453 --> 00:06:20,737
Whitney's performance
at the '89 Grammys was legend,

173
00:06:20,822 --> 00:06:22,789
and no one has done
that song justice since.

174
00:06:22,857 --> 00:06:24,791
But then again, there's also
"All the Man That I Need."

175
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:26,209
Oh, my God!
That song is amazing!

176
00:06:26,294 --> 00:06:27,527
You-you must do it.

177
00:06:27,578 --> 00:06:29,412
Finally, a love song
where it didn't have to hurt

178
00:06:29,497 --> 00:06:30,964
to turn out right.

179
00:06:31,031 --> 00:06:32,666
Sorry. Am I being really loud?

180
00:06:32,717 --> 00:06:35,218
When I get excited,
I tend to start yelling.

181
00:06:35,303 --> 00:06:37,337
No, no. You're just
really enthusiastic.

182
00:06:37,388 --> 00:06:38,672
It's refreshing.

183
00:06:38,723 --> 00:06:39,973
Infectious, actually.

184
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,558
Then I should quit
while I'm ahead.

185
00:06:41,642 --> 00:06:42,976
Nice to meet you,
Kurt Hummel.

186
00:06:43,043 --> 00:06:45,562
I'm sure you'll nail
whatever song you pick.

187
00:06:45,646 --> 00:06:46,813
Thank you.
Oh, and good luck

188
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:47,881
with your NYADA callback.

189
00:06:47,932 --> 00:06:49,883
Let me know if I can be
of any help.

190
00:06:49,934 --> 00:06:52,051
(New York accent):
We future New Yorkers
got to stick together.

191
00:06:52,103 --> 00:06:54,938
(chuckles)
Can I get your number?

Obviously, I like dancing
with Santana best,

234
00:09:12,376 --> 00:09:14,160
but you guys are all
still cool dancers.

235
00:09:14,211 --> 00:09:15,962
And Quinn, you're still
dancing in my dreams.

236
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,331
And you can fly
and breathe fire.

237
00:09:20,735 --> 00:09:20,735
+

238
00:09:23,085 --> 00:09:24,919
JOE:
Quinn... you okay?

239
00:09:25,003 --> 00:09:27,004
You looked kind of bummed
out back there.

240
00:09:27,055 --> 00:09:29,039
I'm fine.

241
00:09:29,091 --> 00:09:30,925
How's your physical
therapy going?

242
00:09:32,144 --> 00:09:33,261
I keep going,

243
00:09:33,345 --> 00:09:34,679
and nothing seems
to be happening,

244
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:35,897
so it's pretty depressing.

245
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,984
Well, what if I went
with you next time?

246
00:09:40,051 --> 00:09:41,652
That would definitely
be less depressing.

247
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,053
You really don't have
to go with me.

248
00:09:43,105 --> 00:09:43,938
I want to.

249
00:09:45,774 --> 00:09:47,692
You want to come with me? Why?

250
00:09:47,743 --> 00:09:49,560
I care about you.

251
00:09:49,611 --> 00:09:51,829
And, to me, being a
Christian isn't about talk.

252
00:09:51,897 --> 00:09:53,197
It's about actions.

253
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,917
Come on.

254
00:09:56,001 --> 00:09:58,202
I'll let you hold one
of my dreads for luck.

255
00:09:58,253 --> 00:09:59,954
(chuckles)

256
00:10:04,176 --> 00:10:07,044
I've got a little surprise
for you.

257
00:10:07,095 --> 00:10:09,297
Okay, if this is another
Rihanna song in the pool,

258
00:10:09,381 --> 00:10:10,681
I have to take
pictures this time.

259
00:10:10,749 --> 00:10:11,883
I...

260
00:10:13,135 --> 00:10:15,136
Mademoiselle Pillsbury?
Mm-hmm.

261
00:10:17,556 --> 00:10:20,090
(gasps, laughs)

262
00:10:20,142 --> 00:10:21,726
What is this?

263
00:10:21,777 --> 00:10:26,147
"I Do's Done Right Wedding
Planning by Mr. Lavender."

264
00:10:26,231 --> 00:10:28,366
Mr. Lavender.

265
00:10:28,433 --> 00:10:30,902
Northwestern Ohio's
premier wedding planner.

266
00:10:30,953 --> 00:10:32,286
I booked him for us.

267
00:10:32,371 --> 00:10:34,605
I'm getting
a pretty decent tax refund.

268
00:10:34,656 --> 00:10:36,908
And I sold some blood platelets.

269
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,826
This is absolutely
wonderful,

270
00:10:38,911 --> 00:10:41,612
but, um, I'm not so
sure that we need him.

271
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,130
You know, I mean, since
we're having the wedding

272
00:10:43,215 --> 00:10:44,281
at Christmas,
the-the church

273
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,550
is already going
to be decorated.

274
00:10:45,617 --> 00:10:47,051
I was going to put the
champagne fountain

275
00:10:47,118 --> 00:10:48,419
near the manger,
the cake near the...

276
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,171
I want to move the wedding up--
to May.

277
00:10:50,255 --> 00:10:52,640
May-- that's...
that's next month.

278
00:10:52,724 --> 00:10:53,925
(chuckling):
Uh-huh.

279
00:10:53,976 --> 00:10:55,893
Is this about S-E-X?

280
00:10:55,961 --> 00:10:57,511
This is about us.

281
00:10:57,596 --> 00:10:59,931
Emma, we've been in love
for almost three years.

282
00:10:59,982 --> 00:11:01,899
There's no reason we should
wait seven more months.

283
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:04,485
Except for the fact that wedding
planning takes so much time.

284
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,686
It takes so
much time.

285
00:11:05,771 --> 00:11:07,271
I mean, I just started
decorating our

286
00:11:07,322 --> 00:11:08,823
personalized nut cups, and I'm
only on the fifth one and...

287
00:11:12,611 --> 00:11:15,196
I guess we can let Mr.
Lavender worry about the...

288
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:18,165
Okay.

289
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,450
Okay?
All right.

290
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:20,451
Okay?
Okay.

291
00:11:20,502 --> 00:11:22,003
(school bell ringing)

292
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:23,921
Oh, my God, I've been practicing
Whitney Houston's version

293
00:11:23,989 --> 00:11:25,289
of "The Star Spangled
Banner" all night,

294
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,290
and I still
can't sing it.

295
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:27,341
You're just
realizing this now?

296
00:11:27,426 --> 00:11:29,343
I'm surprised
anyone's attempted it

297
00:11:29,428 --> 00:11:31,045
after she nailed it
to the wall.

298
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:32,296
(cell phone vibrating)

299
00:11:32,347 --> 00:11:34,465
Oh, I know
what that is.

300
00:11:34,516 --> 00:11:36,968
Finn sends me cutsie text
messages all the time.

301
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:38,269
Usually, they're
puns about my boobs,

302
00:11:38,336 --> 00:11:39,503
but I still
appreciate the effort.

303
00:11:39,554 --> 00:11:40,972
It's not from Blaine.

304
00:11:41,023 --> 00:11:42,974
Th-Then who is it?

305
00:11:43,025 --> 00:11:44,341
He's just a guy.

306
00:11:44,393 --> 00:11:46,560
I met him at
Between the Sheets.
Oh.

307
00:11:46,645 --> 00:11:47,678
His name is Chandler.

308
00:11:47,729 --> 00:11:49,063
He's-he's nice.

309
00:11:49,147 --> 00:11:50,781
And what did Mr. Between
the Sheets say then?

310
00:11:50,849 --> 00:11:52,683
Nothing.

311
00:11:52,734 --> 00:11:54,201
We just joke around.

312
00:11:54,286 --> 00:11:55,903
It's sweet.
Mm-hmm.

313
00:11:55,988 --> 00:11:58,456
Okay, all right.
Um...

314
00:11:58,523 --> 00:11:59,573
"Are you an astronaut?

315
00:11:59,658 --> 00:12:01,242
Because your smile
is out of this world."

316
00:12:01,326 --> 00:12:02,326
Oh! Are you
kidding me?

317
00:12:02,377 --> 00:12:04,295
(gasps)

318
00:12:04,362 --> 00:12:07,031
Kurt, you have been going at
this with him for two days now?

319
00:12:07,082 --> 00:12:08,299
It's nothing.

320
00:12:08,366 --> 00:12:09,867
It's-it's just fun.
He makes me feel good.

321
00:12:09,918 --> 00:12:12,003
Blaine is supposed to
make you feel good.

322
00:12:14,222 --> 00:12:16,924
You said that Finn sends you
cute text messages every day?

323
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:18,542
Does he compliment you?

324
00:12:18,593 --> 00:12:20,210
Constantly trying
to get in your pants?

325
00:12:20,262 --> 00:12:21,512
Yeah, he's an
18-year-old boy.

326
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:27,384
Have you ever heard of
lesbian bed death?

327
00:12:27,436 --> 00:12:29,219
No.
I read about it online.

328
00:12:29,271 --> 00:12:30,738
It's when two lesbians
date for long enough,

329
00:12:30,822 --> 00:12:32,606
they become like sisters.
Oh.

330
00:12:32,691 --> 00:12:34,725
And Blaine and I are like
an old married couple--

331
00:12:34,776 --> 00:12:35,993
a fabulous old married couple,

332
00:12:36,061 --> 00:12:37,611
like Paul Newman
and Joanne Woodward.

333
00:12:37,696 --> 00:12:39,530
But I don't think
we've had an unscheduled

334
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:40,915
make-out session in,
like, a month.

335
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:42,867
You schedule
make-out sessions?

336
00:12:42,918 --> 00:12:46,754
The point is: I love Blaine
and-and Blaine loves me,

337
00:12:46,838 --> 00:12:48,238
but he doesn't exactly
make me blush

338
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,406
with his texts right now.

339
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:50,624
W-What's the harm of someone

340
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:52,376
making me feel special
if it's all innocent?

341
00:12:52,427 --> 00:12:53,844
Okay.

342
00:12:53,912 --> 00:12:55,629
Would you show Blaine
those text messages?

343
00:12:55,714 --> 00:12:57,414
Of course not.
Oh, well, then I guess

344
00:12:57,466 --> 00:12:58,549
it's not that innocent.

345
00:13:01,136 --> 00:13:02,853
(cell phone vibrating)

346
00:13:02,921 --> 00:13:03,971
(school bell ringing)

347
00:13:04,056 --> 00:13:05,589
Hey, some great Whitney songs
so far

348
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,608
this week, guys.
I'm really proud of the way

349
00:13:07,693 --> 00:13:09,310
you guys have been
conjuring up the emotions

350
00:13:09,394 --> 00:13:12,396
you feel towards her as we begin
to move on and say good-bye.

351
00:13:12,447 --> 00:13:13,731
Mr. Shue, I've been
going with Quinn

352
00:13:13,782 --> 00:13:15,265
to her rehab
this week.

353
00:13:15,317 --> 00:13:16,534
We started working
on a Whitney song together

354
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:17,618
that we'd like to share.

355
00:13:17,703 --> 00:13:19,153
Not sure how
it's gonna help

356
00:13:19,237 --> 00:13:21,655
anyone say good-bye, but it's
a song we both really dig.

Quinn, when you sang

"Saving All My Love For You"

428
00:17:57,088 --> 00:17:59,590
with Joe yesterday,
it sure felt like you meant it.

429
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:02,309
You guys seemed like a lot more
than just singing partners.

430
00:18:02,394 --> 00:18:03,961
I don't know, Joe's
really pretty,

431
00:18:04,012 --> 00:18:05,813
but I heard she doesn't
shave her armpits.

432
00:18:05,897 --> 00:18:07,297
Joe and I are
just friends.

433
00:18:07,349 --> 00:18:08,465
Nothing else is
gonna happen.

434
00:18:08,517 --> 00:18:10,017
But you want it to,
don't you?

435
00:18:10,101 --> 00:18:11,802
Doesn't matter
what I want.

436
00:18:11,853 --> 00:18:14,772
I've said good-bye to
that part of my life.

437
00:18:14,823 --> 00:18:17,024
Joe took me to rehab
the other day, we had a moment,

438
00:18:17,108 --> 00:18:18,659
and before we kissed,
he pulled away.

439
00:18:18,743 --> 00:18:20,528
Grossed out by me and my chair.

440
00:18:20,612 --> 00:18:21,862
Quinn, I'm-I'm so sorry.

441
00:18:21,947 --> 00:18:23,163
I don't want to hear that tone.

442
00:18:23,248 --> 00:18:24,081
Joe's not into me.

443
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,501
I don't blame him.

444
00:18:27,586 --> 00:18:29,537
Who would be?

445
00:18:29,621 --> 00:18:30,788

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,710
Will, honey.

449
00:18:36,795 --> 00:18:38,345
Um, Will, this is...

450
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,713
Mr. La-vender,
the wedding planner.

451
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:40,514
It's La-ven-der.

452
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:41,265
Richard Lavender.

453
00:18:41,332 --> 00:18:43,100
It's a family name.

454
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:44,969
Oh. Wow.

455
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,637
You are not
what I was expecting.

456
00:18:46,688 --> 00:18:48,556
Look, we are having
such exciting ideas.

457
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,173
Citrus and Wasabi
are your colors.

458
00:18:50,225 --> 00:18:51,225
Wasabi is the
new sea foam.

459
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:52,776
Nice. I...
Right.

460
00:18:52,844 --> 00:18:53,978
And did you know that we can
get these little handy wipes

461
00:18:54,029 --> 00:18:55,345
with our names embossed
on the wrappers?

462
00:18:55,397 --> 00:18:57,231
This sounds great.
Couple things.

463
00:18:57,315 --> 00:18:58,732
At the reception,
I will be rapping.

464
00:18:58,817 --> 00:19:00,401
And we're gonna need
a pretty big stage,

465
00:19:00,485 --> 00:19:01,952
'cause the Glee kids
are gonna perform, too.

466
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,787
I've checked all the available
venues for your dates,

467
00:19:03,855 --> 00:19:05,906
and none of them will
accommodate a stage.

468
00:19:05,991 --> 00:19:07,291
Well, let's keep looking.

469
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:09,376
Okay, sweetie,
look, I know that

470
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:11,361
you really want to have
this wedding soon,

471
00:19:11,413 --> 00:19:13,363
I just can't imagine how
we're gonna get all this

472
00:19:13,415 --> 00:19:15,132
done in time.

473
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:16,967
Mr. Lavender has
recommended that

474
00:19:17,035 --> 00:19:18,702
maybe we look at dates
in September or October.

475
00:19:18,753 --> 00:19:20,170
We're not moving the date.
Okay.

476
00:19:20,221 --> 00:19:21,589
I'm a wedding planner,
not a miracle worker.

477
00:19:21,673 --> 00:19:22,890
I need more time.

478
00:19:22,974 --> 00:19:24,091
You know what? Forget it.

479
00:19:24,175 --> 00:19:24,875
Will, okay, wait...

480
00:19:24,926 --> 00:19:26,010
We can do this ourselves.

481
00:19:26,061 --> 00:19:27,978
We are getting married in May,

482
00:19:28,046 --> 00:19:28,979
just like we agreed.

483
00:19:29,047 --> 00:19:30,931
Thank you for your time.

484
00:19:31,016 --> 00:19:33,150
(school bell ringing)

485
00:19:38,023 --> 00:19:40,774
You want to lift?

486
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:42,409
Actually wanted to talk to you
about Quinn.

487
00:19:42,494 --> 00:19:43,410
You dig her.

488
00:19:43,495 --> 00:19:44,828
Yeah, I can tell.

489
00:19:44,896 --> 00:19:45,663
Everyone can.

490
00:19:46,531 --> 00:19:47,898
I think she's into you, too.

491
00:19:47,949 --> 00:19:48,782
Seriously?

492
00:19:48,867 --> 00:19:49,900
How do you know?

493
00:19:49,951 --> 00:19:51,669
I used to date her.

494
00:19:51,736 --> 00:19:53,754
So, when you dated her,

495
00:19:53,838 --> 00:19:57,091
how did you handle
your... feelings?

496
00:19:57,175 --> 00:20:00,044
Here's the thing about me:
I can be super helpful,

497
00:20:00,095 --> 00:20:02,296
but when you ask me stuff,
you have to be real specific.

498
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,431
When I was with Quinn
at her rehab,

499
00:20:04,516 --> 00:20:07,434
I was having...

500
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:08,852
feelings.

501
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,104
You mean like "in
your pants" feelings?

502
00:20:12,357 --> 00:20:13,557
I've been homeschooled
my whole life.

503
00:20:13,608 --> 00:20:15,092
It was a lot easier
to resist temptation

504
00:20:15,143 --> 00:20:17,144
when there were
no girls around.

505
00:20:17,228 --> 00:20:19,897
Yeah, I gave up on that.
I had sex last year.

506
00:20:19,948 --> 00:20:22,149
I mean, I was working
in a strip club, so...

507
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:24,201
But it's a sin. We're supposed
to wait until we're married.

508
00:20:24,268 --> 00:20:26,286
And we're not supposed to
get tattoos-- Leviticus.

509
00:20:26,371 --> 00:20:28,656
Look, when the Bible was
written, things were easier.

510
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,107
I mean, there
was no Internet,

511
00:20:30,158 --> 00:20:31,825
chicks didn't wear short
skirts or anything.

512
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,494
I'm a good Christian,
but there's just

513
00:20:33,578 --> 00:20:35,579
no way a dude's gonna
be able to resist.

514
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,382
I say, let's be a new kind
of Christian, one that

515
00:20:38,449 --> 00:20:40,801
prays and does right by
people but understands

516
00:20:40,885 --> 00:20:43,387
that some of those rules
are kind of old school.

517
00:20:43,454 --> 00:20:44,755
The sex rule makes sense.

518
00:20:44,806 --> 00:20:46,289
It's about
respecting your body,

519
00:20:46,341 --> 00:20:48,125
putting the spiritual
over the physical

520
00:20:48,176 --> 00:20:50,460
so you can feel
closer to God.

521
00:20:50,512 --> 00:20:51,478
Okay.

522
00:20:51,563 --> 00:20:53,847
(sighs)
All I know is

523
00:20:53,932 --> 00:20:55,899
Quinn's a great girl, but
you're gonna have to decide

524
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:58,468
if you want to get closer to God
or get closer to her.

525
00:21:03,808 --> 00:21:05,859
Hey, I got the cheese plate.

526
00:21:05,944 --> 00:21:08,946
<i>Our Being Bobby Brown marathon
can officially begin.</i>

527
00:21:08,997 --> 00:21:11,314
Who's Chandler?

528
00:21:11,366 --> 00:21:13,316
Why are you going
through my phone?

529
00:21:13,368 --> 00:21:15,419
I'm not going
through your phone.

530
00:21:15,486 --> 00:21:17,371
It's just that
it keeps buzzing

531
00:21:17,455 --> 00:21:20,574
because Chandler won't
stop texting you.

532
00:21:20,642 --> 00:21:23,293
"When we go to New York,
let's go to the front

533
00:21:23,344 --> 00:21:25,929
<i>of the Plaza and reenact
the end of The Way We Were."</i>

534
00:21:25,997 --> 00:21:28,015
Give me that.
"Can you sing
into my voicemail?

535
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:29,967
I want to make your
voice my ringtone."

536
00:21:30,018 --> 00:21:31,552
Give me my phone.

537
00:21:31,636 --> 00:21:34,388
There are literally dozens of
texts between the two of you.

538
00:21:34,472 --> 00:21:35,505
Do you know how many times

539
00:21:35,557 --> 00:21:36,840
you've texted me
in the past two days?

540
00:21:36,891 --> 00:21:38,842
Four.

541
00:21:38,893 --> 00:21:41,645
And three of them
were about finding

542
00:21:41,696 --> 00:21:42,696
peach-colored shoe polish.

543
00:21:42,781 --> 00:21:43,781
Why are you
getting so upset?

544
00:21:43,848 --> 00:21:45,649
This is, this is all innocent.

545
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,785
This is cheating, Kurt.

546
00:21:47,852 --> 00:21:49,820
This is texting.

547
00:21:49,871 --> 00:21:51,155
Okay, he is
just a guy

548
00:21:51,206 --> 00:21:52,623
that I met at the music store.

549
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:53,824
Nothing happened.

550
00:21:53,892 --> 00:21:55,492
You used to text
Sebastian all the time.

551
00:21:55,543 --> 00:21:56,710
You would call
him, even.

552
00:21:56,795 --> 00:21:58,195
But I didn't like him,

553
00:21:58,246 --> 00:22:00,164
and all of those texts
were family friendly.

554
00:22:00,215 --> 00:22:01,331
(sighs)

555
00:22:01,382 --> 00:22:03,383
You like this guy.

556
00:22:06,204 --> 00:22:07,838
I like the way
he makes me feel.

557
00:22:07,889 --> 00:22:09,673
I mean, when was
the last time

558
00:22:09,724 --> 00:22:13,227
that you complimented me
or told me how special I was?

559
00:22:13,311 --> 00:22:15,596
I transferred schools
to be with you!

560
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,348
(chuckling):
I, I changed
my whole life!

561
00:22:18,399 --> 00:22:20,601
That doesn't
make you feel loved?

562
00:22:20,685 --> 00:22:23,353
You don't know what it's like
being your boyfriend, okay?

563
00:22:23,404 --> 00:22:26,190
You are the alpha gay!

564
00:22:26,241 --> 00:22:27,691
Even Rachel wanted
to make out with you.

565
00:22:27,742 --> 00:22:29,409
I used to get solos

566
00:22:29,494 --> 00:22:30,393
every week.

567
00:22:30,445 --> 00:22:32,029
And do you know how many times

568
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,248
I've had to sit on a stool
and watch you perform?

569
00:22:34,332 --> 00:22:36,033
Then talk to me.

570
00:22:36,084 --> 00:22:37,367
Tell me that you're unhappy,

571
00:22:37,418 --> 00:22:39,736
but don't cheat on me.

572
00:22:39,788 --> 00:22:41,404
I feel like I have
taken crazy pills!

573
00:22:41,456 --> 00:22:43,207
I didn't cheat on you!

574
00:22:43,258 --> 00:22:47,127
I'm, I'm really sorry
if this made you upset,

575
00:22:47,212 --> 00:22:50,430
but it's, it's, it's okay.

576
00:22:52,433 --> 00:22:53,967
It's not right...

577
00:22:55,487 --> 00:22:57,337
but it's okay.

578
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:04,511
This song is for anyone
that's ever been cheated on.

579
00:23:04,596 --> 00:23:07,047
This is insane.
I didn't cheat on you!

580
00:23:07,132 --> 00:23:09,933

land speed of any living animal.

(bell ringing)

625
00:25:29,151 --> 00:25:31,152
Hi.

626
00:25:31,237 --> 00:25:32,604
Hi.

627
00:25:32,655 --> 00:25:34,522
You know, you can learn a lot
about a person

628
00:25:34,607 --> 00:25:35,607
by looking into their locker.

629
00:25:35,658 --> 00:25:37,025
Are you, like, stalking me?

630
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:38,693
You know we blew it, right?

631
00:25:38,778 --> 00:25:41,112
We wasted three years going
at each other's throats

632
00:25:41,163 --> 00:25:43,031
when we could have
been singing together,

633
00:25:43,115 --> 00:25:44,282
killing it in Glee Club.

634
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:46,818
We hated each other.
Actually, I hated you.

635
00:25:48,337 --> 00:25:50,822
Sorry. Yes, our duet in Glee
was a whole truckload

636
00:25:50,873 --> 00:25:52,874
of awesome.
And who cares that it
took three years?

637
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:55,760
I mean, we still have plenty
of time to do it again.

638
00:25:55,828 --> 00:25:58,463
We have 42 days ft
until graduation.

639
00:25:58,514 --> 00:26:00,599
Half of that's gonna be
prepping for Nationals.

640
00:26:00,666 --> 00:26:01,683
That was it.

641
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:02,968
Oh, crap. I think

642
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,853
I just realized
gonna miss you.

643
00:26:04,937 --> 00:26:06,888
Oh, God, say something
irritating so I can get

644
00:26:06,973 --> 00:26:08,523
the taste of this out
of my head, please.

645
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,692
It's okay. Look...

646
00:26:10,776 --> 00:26:14,646
you went out of your way
to make my life a living hell
for three years,

647
00:26:14,697 --> 00:26:16,481
but at the end
of the day, I know

648
00:26:16,532 --> 00:26:18,366
that you respect
my talent and my ambition.

649
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:20,118
I like it when
you sing, and hey,

650
00:26:20,185 --> 00:26:22,370
you're the only other person
at this school besides me

651
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,872
who's willing to kill
their best friend

652
00:26:23,956 --> 00:26:25,907
to get to the top.
Yeah.

653
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:28,376
Will you do me a favor?

654
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:30,295
Will you put this up
in your locker?

655
00:26:30,362 --> 00:26:32,864
You want me to put up a picture
of you in my locker?

656
00:26:32,915 --> 00:26:34,666
Okay, we may not be able
to sing together,

657
00:26:34,717 --> 00:26:37,969
but we have 42 days left
to at least be friends.

658
00:26:38,037 --> 00:26:40,705
I'm gonna give you a hug.
It'll be quick.

659
00:26:40,756 --> 00:26:42,557
(chuckles)

660
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:44,092
I'll see you in Glee Club.

662
00:26:53,152 --> 00:26:54,736
What's with all
the stickers?

00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,489

blue is for go,

665
00:27:00,242 --> 00:27:01,726
red is for trash

666
00:27:01,777 --> 00:27:04,496
and green is for humidity-
controlled storage to keep in

667
00:27:04,563 --> 00:27:05,697
mint condition
to sell as

668
00:27:05,748 --> 00:27:07,248
memorabilia after I get famous.

669
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,503
Well, what if I want to keep
some of this stuff?

670
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,404
You can go through
my leftovers.

671
00:27:13,456 --> 00:27:15,457
You're not taking this with you?

672
00:27:15,541 --> 00:27:18,626
Blaine and I are on the rocks.

673
00:27:18,711 --> 00:27:20,962
I honestly don't know
what's up with him.

674
00:27:21,047 --> 00:27:22,931
But with that said,
I do reserve

675
00:27:23,015 --> 00:27:24,382
the right to
re-Post-it later.

676
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:26,751
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
This isn't garbage.

677
00:27:26,802 --> 00:27:30,388
Dad, it's a certificate
of participation for Regionals.

678
00:27:30,439 --> 00:27:31,756
The one that we lost.

679
00:27:31,807 --> 00:27:33,925
Come on. We have to be heartless
about this stuff.

680
00:27:33,976 --> 00:27:35,593
<i>You've seen Hoarders.
This is how it starts.</i>

681
00:27:35,644 --> 00:27:37,479
I'd like to keep it.

682
00:27:37,563 --> 00:27:39,030
Dad, don't be
sentimental on me.

683
00:27:39,098 --> 00:27:40,398
Well, no, screw that.

684
00:27:40,449 --> 00:27:41,766
We haven't been getting
sentimental enough, okay?

685
00:27:41,817 --> 00:27:44,869
The both of us, we've been way
too casual about this.

686
00:27:44,937 --> 00:27:46,287
Do you realize that
we haven't had

687
00:27:46,372 --> 00:27:47,706
our Friday night dinner
for three weeks?

688
00:27:47,773 --> 00:27:49,040
You've been in D.C.

689
00:27:49,108 --> 00:27:50,875
You think I couldn't get
an earlier flight?

690
00:27:50,943 --> 00:27:53,444
Most of the other congressman
are gone on Thursday night.

691
00:27:53,496 --> 00:27:55,279
Okay, I don't get it. So why
have you been skipping dinner?

692
00:27:55,331 --> 00:27:56,781
Because I don't want you to go!

693
00:28:02,955 --> 00:28:04,723
You know, you and me,

694
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:07,392
we've been doing this dance
for over a decade.

695
00:28:07,459 --> 00:28:09,427
You know, Starsky and gay Hutch.

696
00:28:10,813 --> 00:28:12,731
Everybody warned me
that when you were eight,

697
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:15,350
and you were bugging
the crap out of me that

698
00:28:15,434 --> 00:28:18,653
one day I'd be begging for you
to wake me up at 4:00 a.m.

699
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:21,322
with a nightmare
or, you know,

700
00:28:21,407 --> 00:28:23,641
wreck the kitchen,
playing restaurant.

701
00:28:23,692 --> 00:28:24,976
I was nine.

702
00:28:25,027 --> 00:28:26,811
Who knew paella was
gonna be so complicated?

703
00:28:26,862 --> 00:28:28,947
(chuckles)

704
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,649
So you've been skipping dinners
because you're sad

705
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,169
there's not gonna be any more
dinners? I'm confused.

706
00:28:34,253 --> 00:28:37,422
Ah, you don't get it yet.

707
00:28:37,489 --> 00:28:38,339
You know,

708
00:28:38,424 --> 00:28:40,258
I know you got a taste of it

709
00:28:40,325 --> 00:28:41,793
when you lost your mom,

710
00:28:41,844 --> 00:28:44,129
but it's just like the older
you get, you just see.

711
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,930
It's just, none of it lasts.

712
00:28:45,998 --> 00:28:47,715
Yes, you and I will

713
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,350
always love each other,

714
00:28:49,435 --> 00:28:51,386
and you and I will always
be there for each other,

715
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:54,105
but, you know, as soon
as you walk out our door

716
00:28:54,173 --> 00:28:55,273
towards New York,

717
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,208
everything's
gonna change.

718
00:28:57,276 --> 00:29:00,178
And it won't change back.

719
00:29:00,246 --> 00:29:02,180
Not to the way it is now.

720
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,452
Listen, I am so happy for you.

721
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:09,454
Kurt, really,

722
00:29:09,521 --> 00:29:12,523
I am so happy
and I am so proud.

723
00:29:12,575 --> 00:29:16,194
You know, you and me, we, uh,
we made each other men.

724
00:29:16,245 --> 00:29:17,962
Yeah.

725
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:22,066
Just sometimes I just, I want
my sweet little boy back.

726
00:29:27,372 --> 00:29:29,374
(voice breaks):
I'm gonna miss you, Kurt.

727
00:29:30,593 --> 00:29:33,044
A lot.

728
00:29:33,095 --> 00:29:34,762
I'm gonna to miss you, too, Dad.

Okay, bros, here you go.
I was inspired

760
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,220
by the goodie bags
they give out

761
00:32:27,272 --> 00:32:28,405
at the end of
birthday parties.

762
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,823
Thought I'd try it.

763
00:32:29,891 --> 00:32:31,558
A little something from
the Puckster to all of you.

764
00:32:31,609 --> 00:32:34,028
Sorry, Finn, I tried to
get your balls back from Rachel,

765
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:35,412
but she's got those on lockdown.

766
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:38,332
Guitar pick. Sweet.

767
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,735
And a shot glass that says
"Dinosaurs on Ice."

768
00:32:41,786 --> 00:32:43,837
Why does mine say,
"Drink till she's cute"?

769
00:32:43,905 --> 00:32:45,873
Had the picks inscribed with
"The Dudes of Glee 2012".

770
00:32:45,924 --> 00:32:48,792
Shot glasses all say different
things 'cause I jacked them

771
00:32:48,877 --> 00:32:50,461
from houses
I clean pools at.

772
00:32:50,545 --> 00:32:52,412
Thanks, man.
What's this for?

773
00:32:52,464 --> 00:32:54,348
The clock's ticking,
the time's coming

774
00:32:54,415 --> 00:32:56,100
when we're all gonna
have to say adios.

775
00:32:56,184 --> 00:32:57,601
Some of us, forever.

776
00:32:57,685 --> 00:32:59,436
I want to make sure you guys
remember all the broments

777
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:01,305
that we had together,

778
00:33:01,389 --> 00:33:03,190
and the great things
we accomplished, forever.

779
00:33:03,257 --> 00:33:06,026
I know I haven't always been
the perfect friend or teammate,

780
00:33:06,094 --> 00:33:07,945
but you've stuck by me,
forgiven me

781
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:09,279
for sleeping with your women.

782
00:33:09,364 --> 00:33:11,532
Not everyone in my life
has done that.

783
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:13,200
One cougar's husband even
chased me around with a gun.

784
00:33:13,267 --> 00:33:15,369
Anyways...

785
00:33:15,436 --> 00:33:17,538
I'm only gonna say this once...

786
00:33:18,773 --> 00:33:19,940
...but I'm going to
miss all of you.

787
00:33:21,576 --> 00:33:22,609
I love you guys.

788
00:33:23,778 --> 00:33:25,913
Cheers.

789
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:27,381
Cheers.

790
00:33:27,448 --> 00:33:29,449
(school bell ringing)

791
00:33:29,501 --> 00:33:31,451
I'm a little confused as to
what we're doing here.

792
00:33:31,503 --> 00:33:33,887
Well, um, Kurt said
that you two might need

793
00:33:33,955 --> 00:33:35,089
a little couple's counseling.

794
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,473
Are you qualified for that?

795
00:33:36,541 --> 00:33:38,342
Not really. Or at all.

796
00:33:38,426 --> 00:33:39,460
But Sam and Mercedes

797
00:33:39,527 --> 00:33:41,061
came to talk to me,

798
00:33:41,129 --> 00:33:43,347
and you know, I-I think they
found it pretty helpful.

799
00:33:43,431 --> 00:33:44,815
Yeah, I'm-I'm pretty
sure they broke up.

800
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:47,151
Gosh, they seemed like
such a good fit, too, right?

801
00:33:47,235 --> 00:33:50,204
Brutal honesty is the
cornerstone of any relationship.

802
00:33:50,271 --> 00:33:51,822
I want you to feel like

803
00:33:51,906 --> 00:33:54,024
this is a safe space for you
to air your differences.

804
00:33:54,109 --> 00:33:55,475
BLAINE:
Okay.

805
00:33:55,527 --> 00:33:57,344
Well, uh, first...

806
00:33:57,412 --> 00:33:58,779
Kurt has been
texting this guy,

807
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,331
and I got really upset.

808
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:03,083
Although, a while back,

809
00:34:03,151 --> 00:34:05,035
I was sort of doing
the same thing.

810
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,204
But it wasn't...
With the guy who
almost blinded him.

811
00:34:07,288 --> 00:34:09,723
Blaine, I sang you a song
to express my regrets.

812
00:34:09,791 --> 00:34:11,091
Okay, if we're here,

813
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,543
to be brutally honest,

814
00:34:12,627 --> 00:34:14,461
there are a few things
that I'd like to change.

815
00:34:14,512 --> 00:34:16,463
I am actively listening.

816
00:34:16,514 --> 00:34:17,548
Well, for starters,
Kurt has a tendency

817
00:34:17,632 --> 00:34:19,550
to snap his fingers
at wait staff.

818
00:34:19,634 --> 00:34:21,101
The cheesecake's on its way,
Kurt, you don't have to

819
00:34:21,169 --> 00:34:22,719
snap your fingers, it's not
gonna make it come any faster.

820
00:34:22,804 --> 00:34:24,054
Okay, I hear you,

821
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:25,556
and that's something
I'm willing to work on.

822
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,225
Also, please stop slipping
bronzer into my moisturizer.

823
00:34:28,309 --> 00:34:29,059
You look good
with a little color.

824
00:34:29,144 --> 00:34:31,011
I only use lotion on my hands.

825
00:34:31,062 --> 00:34:33,864
It looks weird if a person
just has tan hands.

826
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:35,115
Okay, Kurt, wouldn't
you love Blaine

827
00:34:35,183 --> 00:34:37,117
just as much if he
didn't havtan hands?

828
00:34:37,185 --> 00:34:38,535
And while we're
being perfectly honest,

829
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,353
I don't like that
with every conversation,

830
00:34:40,405 --> 00:34:41,989
we end up always
talking about NYADA.

831
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,408
What song you're gonna sing,

832
00:34:44,492 --> 00:34:46,543
what outfit you're gonna
wear to your callback,

833
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:49,863
how amazing New York is.

834
00:34:49,914 --> 00:34:52,799
New York is the only thing
we talk about now, Kurt,

835
00:34:52,867 --> 00:34:53,867
and it's like...

836
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,138
...well, it's like you can't
even wait to get out of here.

837
00:34:59,724 --> 00:35:01,225
How's that supposed
to make me feel?

838
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,012
In a few months,

839
00:35:05,063 --> 00:35:08,015
you're gonna be gone.

840
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:10,434
With this brand-new life,

841
00:35:10,518 --> 00:35:12,552
these brand-new friends,
brand-new everything,

842
00:35:12,604 --> 00:35:15,022
and I'm gonna be right here.

843
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:16,423
By myself.

844
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:22,279
You're right.

845
00:35:22,363 --> 00:35:24,898
I have been distant.

846
00:35:24,949 --> 00:35:26,533
And I'm sorry.

847
00:35:26,584 --> 00:35:28,118
But I'm just...

848
00:35:28,203 --> 00:35:31,371
trying to practice what life is
going to be like without you.

849
00:35:34,325 --> 00:35:36,460
You are the love
of my life, Kurt.

850
00:35:36,544 --> 00:35:38,262
And I'm pissed off

851
00:35:38,346 --> 00:35:41,265
that I have to learn,
for the next year,

852
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:42,766
what being alone
is gonna be like.

853
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,285
But you're not gonna be alone.

854
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:47,187
I'm gonna Skype you every day,

855
00:35:47,255 --> 00:35:49,556
and you're gonna come visit me
in New York every weekend

856
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:50,774
as far as I'm concerned.

857
00:35:50,858 --> 00:35:52,943
But I promise,

858
00:35:53,027 --> 00:35:54,511
you aren't gonna lose me.

859
00:35:55,697 --> 00:35:57,814
I love you so much.

860
00:35:57,899 --> 00:35:59,766
I love you, too.

861
00:36:04,272 --> 00:36:06,106
(school bell ringing)

862
00:36:09,327 --> 00:36:10,661
Champagne.

863
00:36:10,745 --> 00:36:12,496
On a Tuesday.

864
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,414
We've gone all Hunter S.
Thompson, haven't we?

865
00:36:14,465 --> 00:36:15,782
For the bride.
Thank you.

866
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:17,084
We are celebrating.

867
00:36:18,253 --> 00:36:19,836
Who needs Mr. Lavender?

868
00:36:19,921 --> 00:36:22,506
I have found the perfect
wedding location.

869
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,591
You did?

870
00:36:24,642 --> 00:36:27,627
The K.O.A. campground
by Route Nine.

871
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:29,429
A campground?

872
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,564
Think about it.

873
00:36:30,631 --> 00:36:32,132
They've got plenty of
space for a stage,

874
00:36:32,183 --> 00:36:33,767
the electrical hookups
they use for the RVs

875
00:36:33,818 --> 00:36:36,770
have plenty of juice for all
the amps and the instruments,

876
00:36:36,821 --> 00:36:39,606
and they're leaving the
restrooms open for us

877
00:36:39,657 --> 00:36:41,742
so everyone doesn't have to
walk around with quarters.

878
00:36:41,809 --> 00:36:43,910
It, uh, sounds a bit rustic.

879
00:36:43,978 --> 00:36:46,479
Married under the stars...

880
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:48,415
it's... babe, it's romantic.

881
00:36:48,482 --> 00:36:49,866
I have OCD.

882
00:36:49,951 --> 00:36:51,318
I throw away a broom

883
00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:52,703
after I've used it once,

884
00:36:52,787 --> 00:36:54,588
and you think I want to
get married at a campground?

885
00:36:54,655 --> 00:36:56,423
I-I know it's not ideal,

886
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:58,008
but it was the only place
that was available.

887
00:36:58,092 --> 00:37:00,294
Unless we move
the wedding to November.

888
00:37:00,345 --> 00:37:02,045
I won't do that.

889
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,164
Will, the Glee kids will
come back for the wedding

890
00:37:04,215 --> 00:37:05,332
if it's in November.
What if they don't?

891
00:37:10,972 --> 00:37:14,141
I'm sorry.

892
00:37:14,192 --> 00:37:16,059
(sighs)

893
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:25,569
I just don't want them to leave.

894
00:37:25,636 --> 00:37:28,455
You know, that's the wonderful
thing about being a teacher.

895
00:37:28,522 --> 00:37:32,376
Every year you get a new
group of kids to inspire you.

896
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,494
Yeah, but these kids
changed my life.

897
00:37:34,545 --> 00:37:37,164
Three years ago,
I was just a Spanish teacher

898
00:37:37,215 --> 00:37:42,052
sitting here with Terri telling
me to go be an accountant.

899
00:37:42,136 --> 00:37:45,722
But now I'm going to Nationals
for the second time, and...

900
00:37:45,807 --> 00:37:48,008
and I'm marrying you.

901
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:49,643
It'll never like this again.

902
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:52,562
You know, you and the kids
gave each other a gift.

903
00:37:52,647 --> 00:37:55,732
But the love that
you have for each other,

904
00:37:55,817 --> 00:37:57,150
you keep it with you.

905
00:37:57,218 --> 00:37:58,769
That never goes away.

906
00:37:58,853 --> 00:38:00,220
(choking up):
I'm just going to
miss them so much.

907
00:38:00,271 --> 00:38:02,105
They know.

908
00:38:03,408 --> 00:38:06,743
Which is why, you know,
if-if you and I

909
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:08,995
had our wedding ten years
from now, on the moon,

910
00:38:09,063 --> 00:38:10,397
those kids would be there.

911
00:38:10,448 --> 00:38:13,133
Would you prefer that
to the campground?

912
00:38:16,865 --> 00:38:16,865
+

913
00:38:19,943 --> 00:38:22,077
Is that, is that too much?
Hm-mm.

914
00:38:29,068 --> 00:38:30,703
Is that, um...

915
00:38:32,539 --> 00:38:34,373
I'm so sorry.

916
00:38:34,424 --> 00:38:35,741
(sighs)

917
00:38:35,809 --> 00:38:37,176
It's okay.

918
00:38:37,243 --> 00:38:38,577
It happens.

919
00:38:38,628 --> 00:38:39,795
It's just that you are

920
00:38:39,879 --> 00:38:42,414
the prettiest, nicest,

921
00:38:42,465 --> 00:38:44,350
best-smelling girl
I've ever met.

922
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:45,851
How many girls
have you met?

923
00:38:45,918 --> 00:38:46,918
Weren't you homeschooled?

924
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,387
Don't do that.

925
00:38:48,438 --> 00:38:50,922
Don't find ways to
run yourself down.

926
00:38:50,974 --> 00:38:52,891
I guess I have been
doing that a lot lately.

927
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:56,895
It's just hard not to
focus on what I've lost.

928
00:38:56,947 --> 00:38:59,097
What if I helped you?
Like the way

929
00:38:59,149 --> 00:39:00,733
I use my hands
to move your legs...

930
00:39:00,784 --> 00:39:02,985
maybe you could use
my eyes to see yourself,

931
00:39:03,069 --> 00:39:04,236
the way I see you.

932
00:39:04,304 --> 00:39:06,205
And what would I see?

933
00:39:06,272 --> 00:39:07,790
Perfection.

934
00:39:07,874 --> 00:39:08,891
(laughs)

935
00:39:10,293 --> 00:39:13,128
So... what are you
looking for, here?

936
00:39:13,213 --> 00:39:15,247
I mean, do you want me
to be your girlfriend?

937
00:39:17,417 --> 00:39:18,334
I don't know.

938
00:39:18,418 --> 00:39:20,952
I mean, yes, totally,

939
00:39:21,004 --> 00:39:22,421
but my faith means
everything to me.

940
00:39:22,472 --> 00:39:24,974
It's just that
when I'm with you,

941
00:39:25,058 --> 00:39:27,259
I don't care what God says
about sins of the flesh.

942
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:29,979
I just want to know what
it'd feel like to be...

943
00:39:30,063 --> 00:39:31,313
right up next to you.

944
00:39:31,398 --> 00:39:34,132
You would give up
your faith to be with me?

945
00:39:34,184 --> 00:39:35,967
I don't know.

946
00:39:36,019 --> 00:39:37,302
Are you asking me to?

947
00:39:37,354 --> 00:39:38,804
No.

948
00:39:38,855 --> 00:39:40,322
No, never.

949
00:39:40,407 --> 00:39:43,275
Because you don't
like me that way.

950
00:39:43,326 --> 00:39:45,527
No, because it's
nice knowing that

951
00:39:45,612 --> 00:39:47,363
there's something out
there that can't be lost.

952
00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:54,186
All right, help me up.

953
00:40:00,993 --> 00:40:02,461
Well, so what is this?

954
00:40:02,512 --> 00:40:03,962
About you and me?

955
00:40:04,014 --> 00:40:06,331
I don't know.

956
00:40:06,383 --> 00:40:07,866
Something new.

957
00:40:09,886 --> 00:40:12,805
(school bell ringing)

958
00:40:12,856 --> 00:40:14,773
I love your
jauntily placed cap,

959
00:40:14,841 --> 00:40:16,608
like a Russian Tsar.

960
00:40:16,676 --> 00:40:17,943
(phone buzzes)

961
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:20,011
It's not Chandler.

962
00:40:20,063 --> 00:40:22,231
I swear I told him
not to text me anymore.

963
00:40:22,315 --> 00:40:24,233
I know. It's from me.

964
00:40:26,403 --> 00:40:29,621
How unscheduled of you.

965
00:40:29,689 --> 00:40:30,622
But what about Glee practice?

966
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,190
No one will be there.

967
00:40:32,242 --> 00:40:34,543
Mr. Shue said
it wasn't mandatory,

968
00:40:34,627 --> 00:40:35,961
so Rachel's prepping
her NYADA piece,

969
00:40:36,028 --> 00:40:37,413
Finn's at the shop, Quinn's
getting physical therapy,

970
00:40:37,497 --> 00:40:40,031
Puck's driving to Gomer
for a sale on chlorine.

971
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:41,383
Everyone is going their own way.

972
00:40:43,002 --> 00:40:45,036
Come on.
Let's blow it off.

973
00:40:45,088 --> 00:40:46,505
But it's Glee.

974
00:40:46,556 --> 00:40:48,924
I mean, we only have
so many left together.

975
00:40:49,008 --> 00:40:51,209
