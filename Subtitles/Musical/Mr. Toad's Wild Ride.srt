Care for a mess about
on the river?

22
00:03:56,836 --> 00:04:00,135
It's a perfect day for a picnic.

I hate to bother you. But...

24
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:05,276
something terrible is going on.

00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:08,108
Something terrible going on?

Beautiful day.

31
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:29,164
My dear Mole. There's not
the minutest thing terrible going on.

32
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:33,432
It's a lovely. Glorious day
for a picnic. Jump in.

33
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,700
I-It is a lovely day...

34
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,333
except my home
has been knocked in.

35
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,242
Who knocked in
your home. Mole?

36
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,906
That's what I want to
ask Mr. Toad.

37
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,143
- Toad?
- It was in his meadow.

38
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,811
You won't get any sense
out ofToad...

39
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,685
whereas a picnic might
well steady the nerves.

40
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:55,021
It wasn't very grand.
But it was my home.

41
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:59,029
Well. You... you can come
and live with me. Mole.

42
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,759
I did love it so. Rat.

43
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,869
But the hamper's all packed...

44
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:06,938
and the sandwiches are cut
and... and...

45
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,967
- Oh. All right. Come on. I'll take you to Toad Hall.
- Thank you. Rat.

46
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:16,878
We can have the picnic there.

47
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:20,713
- Oh! Mind the varnish.
- I haven't been in a boat before.

48
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,719
What?

49
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,757
You've never been in a...

50
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,827
Well. Shiver me whiskers.

51
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:34,231
- You poor creature.
- Is it as nice as all that?

52
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,335
It's the only thing.

53
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,464
My dear young friend.
There is nothing...

54
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:43,006
absolutely nothing
half as worth doing...

55
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:46,567
as simply messing about
in a boat.

56
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:50,012

57
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:54,778

- The river's my whole life.

69
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,266
I don't want any other.

70
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:45,030
What it hasn't got
is not worth having...

71
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,605
and what it doesn't know
is not worth knowing.

72
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,901
What's that?

73
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:53,478
- [Bird Shrieking]
- [Rat] That? That's the wildwood.

74
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:58,073
Uh. We don't go there very often.
We riverbankers.

75
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:01,084
Are there
very nice p-people there?

76
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:04,247
Well. The. Um...
the squirrels are all right...

77
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,951
and the. Uh... the rabbits.
Some of them.

78
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,221
And there's Badger. Of course.

79
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:13,730
He lives right in the heart of it.
Dear old Badger.

80
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,825
But it's not for the likes
of you or me.

81
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,436
W-Why not?

82
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:23,065
There are others...
weasels. Particularly.

83
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:28,304
They're all right
in their own way. But they're...

84
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,679
They're just out for themselves.
They don't give a hoot for anyone else.

85
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:35,310
And, uh, beyond the wildwood?

86
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,117
Beyond the wildwood
comes the wide world.

87
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:41,385
That's something that doesn't
concern either you or me.

88
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,791
Please don't ever
refer to it again.

89
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:49,727
Oh. Rat thinks life's one big picnic.

90
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,337
Wait till we take over the riverbank.

91
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,372
He won't find it so easy then.

92
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,567
- Excuse me. Sir.
- Keep still in there.

93
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,472
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

94
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:01,475
There's Toad Hall now.

95
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,810
Finest house on the river.

96
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:07,818
Though we never admit
as much to Toad. Of course.

97
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,354
Hello.

98
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,856
I see the boating craze is over.

99
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,757
First it was sailing.
Then he tired of that.

100
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:19,525
He took up punting. This year
I've been giving him rowing lessons.

101
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:23,328
Come on.
Let's meet Toad.

102
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:34,044
[Mosquito Buzzing]

103
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:38,147
Oh! Hurrah! Splendid!

104
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,515
Toad. This is Mole.

105
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,144
Just going to send for you.
Both of you.

106
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,849
My young friend's
just lost his home.

107
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,153
Has he?
What a stroke of luck.

108
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,990
- No. No. No. It was dreadful.
- You can live with me.

109
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,030
He's going to live with me. Toad.

110
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,726
No. I just acquired the latest thing!
Come and see!

111
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,768
Toad.

112
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,338
- How's the boating?
- Boating? Oh. Pooh!

113
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:04,671
Silly. Boyish amusement.
Gave that up ages ago.

114
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,836
[Toad Chuckling]
Don't mind them. Bit of a stuffy lot.

115
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,177
The finest house on the river, what?

116
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,046
[Snorts]
Yes.

117
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:16,348
I was hoping you'd help me
get my home back.

118
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,389
It was in your meadow.
You see. Toad.

119
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,619
Pooh! Not my meadow any longer.

120
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,662
Sold it off.
I needed a spot of ready cash.

121
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,962
He sold off my hole.

122
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,729
Now. Iook here. Toad.

123
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:34,203
That meadow belonged
to your father.

124
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:38,607
Moles have lived there for centuries.
You can'tjust sell it off.

125
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,737
Behold your new home. Moley!

126
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,606
- What is it?
- Very heavy.

127
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,877
It's the latest thing!

128
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,384
But I don't want
a new home. Ratty.

129
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:55,926
The open road!
The dusty highway!

130
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,428
Heath and hedgerow
and rolling down.

131
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,432
- Here today.
- Off to somewhere else tomorrow!

132
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,002
It doesn't bear thinking about.

133
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:09,567
- I-It's a caravan.
- Ooh, finest cart ever built.

134
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,941
Designed it myself. Of course.

135
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:14,740
And we can set off after lunch.

136
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,872
- Oh. Stop there. Toady.
- Travel. Change. Excitement!

137
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:22,113
Did I just hear you say "start" and "we"
and "after lunch"?

138
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:26,748
Oh. Dear old Ratty. You can't just stick
to your fusty old river all your life.

139
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,826
I want to show you the world!

140
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,395
I don't want to see
the world and I'm...

141
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,499
going to stick to
my fusty old river.

142
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,535
Moley and I are going for a picnic on it.
Aren't we. Mole?

143
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:42,199
- Y-Yes. Once we found out
what happened to my home.
- Oh. Absolutely.

144
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,571
Then it's all settled.
We set off after lunch.

145
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,054
I say. Horsey. Faster!

146
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,693
It's very kind of Mr. Toad.
Of course. But...

147
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,228
it's not like having my own hole.

148
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,266
Don't worry.
He'll soon get bored with it.

149
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,932
[Loud Yawn]

150
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:18,705
[Rat] Toad, when you say you
sold off your meadow...

151
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,143
who did you sell it to?

152
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:24,182
Oh. Some weasels. I believe.

153
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,513
Weasels? Toad!

154
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,179
Oh. Don't... don't start lecturing me.

155
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,585
You know perfectly well
the weasels are after Toad Hall.

156
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,559
- It was only a meadow.
- It was Mole's home.

157
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:38,721
- Oh. Pooh! You worry too much.
- [Disgusted Sigh]

158
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,995
Uh...

159
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:53,511
- [Horn Honking]
- Uh... Look out!

160
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,671
[Horn Honking]

161
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,610
[Whinnying]

162
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,187
[Horn Honking Continues]

163
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,665
- [Honking]
- Scoundrels!

164
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,290
- What was that?
- [Rat] Road hogs!

165
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,869
Toad. Come and give us a hand.

166
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,938
- Boop, boop!
- Toad?

167
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,633
- Boop. Boop!
- Toady.

168
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,006
- Are you all right?
- Boop. Boop!

169
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,512
There. Don't worry.
They've gone.

170
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,447
We'll go straight down to the police station
and lodge a complaint.

171
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:36,578
Complaint? Me. Complain of that
beautiful. Heavenly vision?

172

- The cart's not too badly damaged.
- The cart? Oh. Pooh!

173
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,360
Horrid little cart.
Common cart.

174
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:46,363
Canary-colored cart.

175
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:49,366
Poetry in motion.
The only way to travel.

176
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,665
Here today. And next week tomorrow!
Whoo-wee!

177
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,969

Towns and cities jump.

- [Yells]

189
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:36,212

- Toad. For goodness sake. Slow down!

190
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,580
- Whoo! Ha-ha!
- [Mole] That's the wildwood!

191
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:43,086
- Hang on!
- Toad. You're driving into the wildwood!

00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,157
Yes!
[Hooting]

193
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,061
Toad.

Hang on. You lads...
Funny. Wonder where they went.

198
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,549
Oooh. Hmm.

199
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,279

Help! Help! Please!

204
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,233
Chief. Toad's crashed another car.

205
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,243
That's the seventh he's smashed.

206
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:44,248
That green head's playing
right into our hands.

- Oh.

209

Wait... Wait a minute.

210
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:04,025

212
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:15,677
Well. Well. If it isn't little Mole.

213
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,750
I'm not afraid of you weasels.

214
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,013

be along any moment.

- [Chuckles]
- Friends?

216
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,020
- Yes.
- [Chief Weasel] Listen, Mole.

217
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:30,493
There is no such thing
in this world as friends.

218
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,360
Everyone's only out for themselves.

219
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,925
Take us weasels.

220
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,437
[Together]
First you see us.

221
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,770
Then you don't.

222
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,401

Is it really such a nasty world?

230
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,470
Oh. Yes. A very
nasty world. Indeed.

231
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,336
[Together]
Nastier than you could ever dream of.

232
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:20,003
- From up above!
- And from beneath.

233
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:23,411

Listen. Mole.

249
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:23,305
You tell your friends
to stop meddling in Toad's affairs.

250
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,139
Yes. It's our meadow.
And we're going to build a really big...

251
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,145
Shut up!

252
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:31,910
If Toad wants to sell his property to us.
That's his business.

253
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:35,578
Right. And when he sells us Toad Hall.
We'll call the shots around here.

254
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:38,747
- Why don't you tell him all our plans?
- Well...

255
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,655
at first we make Toad Hall
a weasel-only area.

256
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,163
- Then we ban picnics along the whole riverbank.
- Garbage brain!

257
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,569
It's meant to be a secret!

258
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:56,573
Friends?
You're a spineless nobody. Mole.

259
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,142

There you are. Mole.
Are you all right. Moley?

I am. Now you're here. Ratty.
But are you all right?

265

Oh, I'm fine.
Tuck your scarf in.

266
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,788
- You don't want to catch your death of cold.
- Yes.

267
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:22,890
Hello. That's handy. Right.
Now, we better go and find Toad.

268
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,969
It's not safe in the wildwoods.
You know.

269
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,005
- Yes. I...
- It's not safe at all.

270
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,838
- Pooh. Pooh.
- Come, come.

271
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,504

- Who's there?

272
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,946
- Mr. Toad.
- Waah! It's you!

273
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,144

Good lord. How did I get here?

275
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:48,052
I understand you need finance
for another motorcar.

276
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,458
Another motor? Oh. Yes.

277
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:54,623
We have a little
business proposition.

00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,869
Oh. Ratty. We're not lost. Are we?

279
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:07,378
No. No. No. No. No.
It's. Um... It's this way. Old fellow.

280
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,218
Brace up. Moley. Look!

281
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,930

- Don't worry. He's not that fierce.
- "Fierce"?

290

Come on.

291
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:09,797
What time is it.
For heaven's sake?

292
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:14,311

294

295
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,534
- Um...
- Sorry. Badger.

296
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:40,832
- It's me. Ratty.
- It's the middle of winter.

297
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:44,102
- And my friend Mole.
- And the middle of the night. By the looks of it.

298
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:48,441
Yes. Well. We're lost
in the wildwood.

299
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:51,573
Oh, it's you, you say, Ratty.

300
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:54,049
Well. Obviously. Badger.

301
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:58,756
And. Uh. Mole.

302
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,753
Y-Y-Yes. Sir.

303
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,989
- Well. Come in. Come in.
- Thank you. Badger.

304
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:13,500
Were the weasels
beastly to you. Moley?

305
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:18,838
Mmm. They said they were going to turn
Toad Hall into a weasel-only area.

306
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,505
- Did they?
- Mm-hmm. And ban picnics on the river.

307
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,707
Ban picnics?

308
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:29,879
Mmm. And they said they were going to build a
big something on the meadow Toad sold them.

309
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:32,320
Toad sold his meadow
to the weasels?

310
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:34,858
That's why they
knocked in my home.

311
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,124
Ah. It's all right. Moley.
You can come and live with me.

312
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,961
He's going to
live with me. Badger.

313
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,735
It was only a small.
Dingy little place.

314
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,206
Not like here. Badger...

315
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,404
or your cozy quarters. Rat...

316
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:58,716
or Toad's beautiful hall.

317
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:02,446
But it was my own.
My very own little hole.

318
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:04,488
That good-for-nothing Toad!

319
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:07,251
And now he's crashed
yet another motorcar.

320
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,260
- How many is that?
- Cars or crashes?

321
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,262
It's the same thing with Toad.

322
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:16,692

- This is an outrage.

324
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:30,575
- Oh. Ow! Ouch!
- I've had quite enough visitors for one winter.

325
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:34,277
I was attacked by weasels.
Hundreds of them.

326
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:36,286
Did they sing a dreadful song?

327
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:40,586
They wanted me to put up Toad Hall
as collateral against a new motor.

328
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,785
- Toad. You didn't!
- Of course not.

329
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:46,796
- The old place is worth at least six new motors.
- Six motorcars?

330
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:49,458
It's time you stopped
this motoring craze.

331
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,763
It'd cost the earth. Toady.

332
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,237
- You've squandered the money
your father left you.
- Haven't. There's tons of it.

333
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,208
Your father was a particular
friend of mine. Toad.

334
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:02,542
And I promised him on his deathbed
that I would ensure...

335
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:05,673
that you looked after
your inheritance.

336
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:08,446
- I was only having a bit of fun. Badger.
- So you're a nincompoop.

337
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,249
Oh. Thank you. Badger.

338
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:14,917
Toad. "nincompoop"
is not a compliment.

339
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:16,926
Oh. Isn't it?

340
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,928
Take off those ridiculous goggles.

341
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:22,932
- Shan't.
- Rat.

342
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:27,130
[Gasps]
I say. Badger!

343
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,901
- Now the driving gloves.
- Oh. Not my gloves.

344
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:34,001
Oh. No. They're brand new.
Cost a fortune.

345
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,137
Exactly.

346
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:40,947
- [Toad] Ohh!
- Now you will accompany me in there...

347
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:44,419
where you're going to hear
a few facts about yourself.

348
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:49,116
- [Door Slams]
- [Badger] Pull yourself together!

349
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:52,390
- [Toad Whimpering]
- You're light-minded,
incompetent, irresponsible...

350
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:54,931
impractical with your property!

351
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:57,467
[Yelling Continues, Faint]

352
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:02,038
Goodness only knows
what your father would have said!

353
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,837
- [Toad Crying]
- Don't give me "boo-hoo-hoo"!

354
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,412
It's no good
"boo-hoo-hoo"now!

355
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:11,482
You should have thought of that
in the first place...

356
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:15,144
before you started squandering the money
your father left you!

357
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:17,153
[Clock Bell Dinging]

358
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:19,348
[Door Opening]

359
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:29,265
My friends.
I'm pleased to inform you...

360
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:33,235
that Toad has something important
to say to you both.

361
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:35,704
Sit down. Toad.

362
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:43,913
Right. Toad.

363
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:49,952
Begin with the "how-sorry-l-am" bit.

364
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,818
"Oh. How sorry I am that
I have been so foolish."

365
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:56,951
B-But I'm not sorry.

366
00:24:57,062 --> 00:25:01,192
It wasn't foolish.
It was simply glorious.

367
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:04,166
But didn't you just
tell me in there...

368
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:07,238
Oh. Yes. Yes. In there.
I'd have said anything in there.

369
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,739
You backsliding wretch.

370
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,708
Oh. Dear Badger.
You're so eloquent.

371
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:15,245
You can make me say
whatever you like in there.

372
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,406
But I've been thinking
it over out here...

373
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,246
and I find that out here
I'm not the least bit sorry.

374
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,684
So it's no earthly good
saying I am. Now. Is it?

375
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:26,052
So you don't promise never
to touch another motorcar again?

376
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:29,888
On the contrary.
I promise the very next motorcar I see...

377
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:32,361
Pooh. Pooh!

378
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,193
Pooh. Pooh! Off I go in it!

379
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:36,966
Ooh! Ooh!

380
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:39,093
Very well. Gentlemen. It's plan "B."

381
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,240
Plan "B"?

382
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:47,277
Yes. Ratty. Plan "B."

383
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:51,281
- Hey. Badger!
- Behave like a nincompoop...

384
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,318
you'll be treated
like a nincompoop!

385
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:58,219
[Toad]
Oh! Oh! Ooh! Hey!

386
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:03,589
[Toad] Where are you taking me?
This is no way to treat a Toad.

387
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:06,823
- I've never been treated so atrociously.
- Shut up. Toad.

388
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:08,832
How much further is it. Badger?

389
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:12,097
This tunnel will take us
right to Toad Hall.

390
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:14,603
We're under his meadow now.

391
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:17,539
How under earth did you find
the time to do all this. Badger?

392
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:19,542
Oh. I didn't.

393
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:24,172
Long. Long ago. There
was a city of humans right here.

394
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,614
They thought their city
would endure forever...

395
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:28,948
but humans can't
let things rest.

396
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:32,114
Greed. You see...
that's their undoing.

397
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:36,159
But we remain.
There were badgers here before...

398
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,320
- and there'll be badgers here still.
- [Metal Clanking]

399
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,049
[Weakly]
Tea time.

400
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:08,057
Shh.

401
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,995
We'll teach those weasels. Moley.

402
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:27,067
[Toad]
Come on, you chaps. Just let me out.

403
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:30,579
You know you can trust me.

404
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:34,448
Please! Please, let me out.
[Weeping]

405
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,715
Ooh! Let me out!
Let me out! Ooh!

406
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:43,624
- What's going on? I shall write my solicitor!
- Shut up. Toad!

407
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:46,629
- You want the servants to hear?
- Is this Toad Hall?

408
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:49,393
- Shh!
- I'll be the laughingstock of the kitchen.

409
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,470
- Then shut up!
- [Both Grunting]

410
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,471
- I'm sorry. Sir. I just don't know.
- [Sighs]

411
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:59,270
- Oh. Good day. I am looking for Mr. Toad.
- He's not here.

412
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:06,482
Ouch!

413
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:10,452
I have six new motorcars for him.

414
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:12,580
- Toad!
- You reprobate.

415
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,591
My new motors!
Oh, are they brand new?

416
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,752
Oh, I must see them! Let me out!

417
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:20,262
- Mr. Toad will not be requiring
any new motorcars. Thank you.
- Yes, I do!

418
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,925
- I love them! Let me out!
- H-He's not well.

419
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,832
Ooh, I can see them!
Oh, they're wonders!

420
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:29,737
- Hurrah!
- He's suffering from a mania
brought about by motorcars.

421
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,934
It's not a mania.
I love motorcars.

422
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:35,809
As his physician. I have ordered
he be taken and locked in his room...

423
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:38,007
until this mania
has run its course.

424
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:41,552
- Those cars are my life,
my soul, my raison d'etre!
- Shh!

425
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:45,020
Mr. Toad owes me money.

426
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:47,318
[Chuckling]

427
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:49,359
I love motorcars! Please!

428
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,691
- Let me out!
- Can I make a proposition?

429
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:55,129
- We're always open to a deal.
- How's this then?

430
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:59,636
If you remove these
machines forthwith...

431
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:03,299
I promise not to insert
one part of them...

432
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:07,037
into any portion of your anatomy.

433
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,045
Right.

434
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:11,138
Fair enough.

435
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,150
It's a pleasure
doing business with you.

436
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:22,989
Let me out!

437
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,858
Oh. Dear! Stop them!
Stop them. Somebody!

438
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:28,626
Oh. They're driving off.

439
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:32,100
My lovely motors!

00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:49,452
So. Badger thinks he can cure Toad
of motorcars. Does he?

443
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:52,022
- We don't want him to do that. Chief.
- I know.

444
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,614
- We want him to spend every last penny he's got.
- I know.

445
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:57,786
- So he has to give us Toad Hall.
- What are you telling me for?

446
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,921
Well. Uh...

447

Chief. I'll make sure
Toad doesn't forget about motorcars.

451
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:10,299
- Yes. We have a plan.
- I have a plan.

452
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,308
- We both thought of it.
- No. You didn't.

453
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,310
Just do it!

455
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:28,487

Ooh! Ow!

462
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:05,890
Seems to be a lot
of traffic today. Toad.

463
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,625
Third crash this morning.

464
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,268
Come on.
[Grunts]

465
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,134
Toady. I wish you'd get better.

466
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,265
You know. It's been months now.

467
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:21,971
[Groans]
Perhaps if l... Oh. But. No. I mustn't ask.

468
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,379
- What?
- I was just thinking I might improve...

469
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:27,542
with a little fresh air.

470
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:30,143
Oh. No. No. No.
I can't let you out of this room.

471
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:32,155
You're quite right. Ratty.

472
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:35,920
Although I was only thinking
of a little stroll...

473
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:37,585
along the river.

474
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:43,766
The river.
Oh. It's so beautiful in the snow.

475
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:46,530
- [Water Running]
- But you're quite right.

476
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:49,106
I should stay here safe indoors.

477
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:53,337
Besides. You can't have a picnic
in the middle of winter.

478
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:58,108
Oh. But you can. Everybody thinks you can't.
But you can have a picnic anytime.

479
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:01,777
In fact, winter picnics
are my speciality.

480
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:05,378
All you need
is a hot thermos. A warm rug.

481
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,948
I know the most perfect
little hollow where you can get all snug...

482
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,960
and watch the snow.

483
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,622
- I mean. If anything could take my mind off...
- Quite. Quite.

484
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:16,791
A picnic on the river certainly
would do it. A winter picnic too.

485
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:19,961
There's a picnic hamper
in the cellar all ready.

486
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:22,130
N-No. No. Toad. I can't.

487
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,973
- It might be the very cure.
- Well. Of course. A picnic
on the river cures anything.

488
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:31,139
Oh. Toady. If you
promise me faithfully to behave.

489
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:33,149
Oh. You know me. Ratty.

490
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:35,583
A picnic on the river!

491
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:37,655
- Why didn't we think of it before?
- You'll have to go...

492
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:39,882
right down to the cellar
to get the hamper.

493
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:42,789
Look. Um. Toady...

494
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:45,328
best not mention anything
about this to Badger.

495
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,866
Oh-ho-ho. Wouldn't dream of it.
Old fellow.

496
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,832
Right.

497
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,510
d Oh. The clever men at Oxford d

498
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,520
d Know all there is to be known d

499
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:14,056
d But then none of them know
what half as much d

500
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,422
d As clever old Mr. Toad d

00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:22,592
d Now the world has

502
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,725
d As history books have shown d

503
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,031

00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:13,649
- Bother!
- What rotten luck.

513
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:16,549
Oh. Well. Might as well
have a spot of lunch.

514
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:21,224
Ah. Landlord...

- Certainly. Sir.
- Thank you.

517
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,364
Darling.

518
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:37,773
Oh. Oh. My. Oh. My.

519
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:40,435
Oh. I wonder.

520
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:44,106
I wonder if they'd... sell it.

521
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:47,275
Of course. I'd...
I'd have to test it first...

522
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:52,584
- just to be certain I really liked it.

[Steam Hissing]

530
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,514
The full penalty of the law
is hardly sufficient...

531
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,784
for the heinous. Callous.
Unmitigatedly evil crime...

532
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:29,860
perpetrated by the sniveling wretch...

533

00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:39,065
Thank you. Thank you.

536
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,070
I rest my case.

537
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:45,040
I understood that you were
counsel for the defense.

538
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:49,637
Indeed. I am. Milord.
But his crime is so blackguardly...

539
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:52,682
that this is. In fact.
The best defense that can be offered.

540
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:55,411
I see. Counsel for the prosecution...

541
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,613
do you wish to add to what counsel for
the defense has said?

542
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:02,460
No. Milord. I would just like to wag
my finger at the accused a few times.

543
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,428
Certainly. Certainly.

544

546
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,105
Are there any witnesses
for the defense?

547
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:19,074
Witnesses. Milord? How can there be?
It is an open-and-shut case.

548
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:22,442
- He even insulted an officer of the law.
- He called me a nincompoop.

549
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:27,943
I demand the severest
sentence that milord can cook up.

550
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:32,216
- [Weasels] Hear! Hear!
- It's not much of a defense. Is it?

551
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:35,952
Not much. Milord. No. But the best
that can be done in the circumstances.

552
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:40,861
See the very word guilty
indelibly imprinted upon his brow!

554

- Couldn't the prosecution say something else?
- Silence!

555
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:51,471
Milord. I should like to speak on behalf
of the defendant.

556
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:54,443
- No. Sit down! Sit down!
- Do you really want to?

- Oh. Very well.
- Thank you. Milord.

558
00:36:57,515 --> 00:37:02,316
The gentleman you see before you
has not been in his right mind...

559
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,081
- for some time.
- Have.

560
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:06,656
- Shut up. Toad!
- Uh. Silence in court.

00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:10,921
He's suffering from a dementia.
That's a form of madness.

- It's not madness.
- Brought about by motorcars.

that worthless animal again!

00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:39,816

Would the jury care to find him guilty?

- [Murmuring]
- I object!

00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:46,927
No. I'm not. I'm a rabbit.

574
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:52,296
- Look. He's never a rabbit.
- Is he a rabbit?

575
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:58,364
- Say I'm a rabbit.
- [All] Yes. He's a rabbit.

576
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:01,309
Oh. Very well.
How do you find the accused?

577
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:02,970
Guilty!

00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:10,719
- Say guilty.
- [All] Guilty.

- Guilty.
- Guilty.

It is the sentence of this court...

583
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:22,565
that you be taken hence to a place
of lawful execution. There to be hanged...

584
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:25,966
- What?
- You can't hang him. Milord.

585
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,970
Oh. Oh. Well.

586
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:31,701
In that case. I sentence you
to as long in jail as I possibly can.

587
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:35,210
Say, 12 months for theft...

588
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,577
three years for dangerous driving...

589
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:40,845
and 15 years for cheeking
a police officer.

590
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:44,011
- He called me a nincompoop.
- So you've told us before.

00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:45,884
Nincompoop? Me? Ha.

592
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,050
So 18. uh. 19.

Yes! Nincompoop!

00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,539

- Toad!
- What did I tell you?

600
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:13,040
I increase the sentence to 25 years.

601
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,175
What do you know
about life. About freedom?

602
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:19,586
- You're all miserable. One-eyed nincompoops!
- Thirty years!

00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,887
- What right have you got to judge me?
- Take him down. No. Wait.

in the land.

This is a weasel-only area.

651
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:28,704
And that means nobody's allowed here
except weasels.

652
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:31,144
- What else could it mean?
- Just making sure they got the point.

You idiot!

00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:51,490
Those are meant
to be unloaded here...

658
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:54,730
and the bones
are to go over to the factory.

Sorry. Chief.
I'll change 'em over.

Uh. Why are you
doing that. Rat?

00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:28,929
If in doubt. Mole. It's often best
to help keep the weasels confused...

stay one step ahead of their game.

for breakfast.

00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:08,671
- Oh. Wretched and unhappy...
Did you say bubble and squeak?
- Mm-hmm.

672
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:13,978
- Made it myself.
- Oh. What do I care for the pleasures of the flesh?

673
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:18,418
- Oh. I'll take it away then.
- You don't want to waste it.

674
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:22,982
[Moans]
I shall never see Toad Hall again.

675
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:26,028
Toad Hall? That's the place
they're gonna knock down. Isn't it?

676
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:29,657
I didn't quite catch that.
I thought you said "knock it down."

677
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:32,258
That's right. The new owners
have decided to knock it down.

678
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:34,860
New owners?
What are you talking about. Girl?

679
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:38,169
The old place is mine.
Been in the family for years.

680
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:46,279
"Toad Hall. The ancestral residence
of the now disgraced Toad family...

681
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:49,443
is due for demolition
tomorrow morning."

682
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:55,525
"Weasels. Who say they took
the property over from Mr. Toad...

683
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:59,060
"when he defaulted on repayment
of six new motorcars...

684
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:03,000
say it will be reduced
to rubble in 15 seconds."

685
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,731
- They're gonna blow it up.
- Blow up Toad Hall?

686
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:08,930
It's wonderful what
they can do now. Isn't it?

687
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,736
My father's house.
My sacred trust...

688
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:15,403
blown to smithereens.

689
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:17,639
And it's all my fault.

690
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:20,740
Well. Toad. You'd better stop them.

691
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:24,514
Talk sense. Girl.
What could I do. Incarcerated here?

692
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:27,112
Unhappy Toad.

693
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,124
Oh. Toad.

694
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:33,424
I can't help feeling sorry for you.

695
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:37,432
- In fact. Truth to tell. I'm really quite fond of you.
- Yes. It's true.

696
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:39,729
Ladies find me irresistible.

697
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:41,566
Ouch.

698
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:45,505
- My aunt's a tea lady.
- That's nothing to brag about.

699
00:45:45,642 --> 00:45:48,770
She's very poor and you're very rich.
Or so you keep telling me.

700
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:51,437
Oh. Yes. I have
absolutely pots of money.

701
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:54,915
Well. Then.

702
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:04,959
- Mole!
- Oh! Oh. Rat.

703
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:08,292
W-We're nearly there.
I could hear Toad's voice right above me.

704
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,297
Well done. Mole.

705
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,367
- Well. Come on then.
- Oh. Ratty.

706
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:21,444
This was your idea. Mole.

707
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:26,515
- Y-Yes. But...
- We can'tjust leave Toad
in there, twiddling his thumbs...

708
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:29,175
while the weasels
blow up Toad Hall.

709
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:35,022
You don't expect me
to dress up like that!

710
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:37,889
Oh? Then you can sit here.
Twiddling your thumbs...

711
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:40,428
while the weasels
blow up Toad Hall.

712
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:43,089
Oh. No. No. No. No.

713
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:46,726
Here's your five guineas.

714
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:49,361
Right. Get that off.

715
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:53,033
Careful with that. It's got
all me money in it. What's left of it.

716
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:59,749
Oh.

717
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:04,112
Oh. Ratty. There are
two women with him.

718
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:07,757
Two women?
What are they doing?

719
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:10,451
Taking his clothes off.

720
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:12,494
What?

721
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,591
[Woman Grunts]

722
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:23,396
Now they're dressing him up
in women's clothing.

723
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,065
Perhaps it's some sort of torture.

724
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:30,812
There. The spitting image.

725
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:33,747
- I don't look like that.
- It's me that doesn't look like that.

726
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:37,843
Shut up. Now. You tie Auntie up
while I make sure the coast is clear.

727
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:41,958
If I thought I looked that ugly...

728
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:44,652
I would be more than happy
to stay in jail.

729
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:50,055
- And don't forget to gag her.
- Nothing would give me greater pleasure.

730
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,658
Aah! I mean talk about
the back of a bus.

731
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:56,272
I'm surprised people don't
catch you to Trafalgar Square.

732
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:58,431
Silence. Old hag.

733
00:47:58,575 --> 00:48:02,602
Your cries are of no avail
against a desperate Toad! Ha-ha!

734
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:06,942
- Psst! Toad!
- Who's that?

735
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:10,019
- It's me.
- Ratty. What on earth are you doing there?

736
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,883
Rescuing you. Come on.

737
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:14,320
Oh. Don't need rescuing. Old chap.

738
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:16,585
Got a clever plan
all worked out meself.

739
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:20,754
But. Toady. All you've gotta do
is follow me. Mole's built this tunnel.

740
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:24,163
No. A tunnel is no way for an animal
of my mettle to escape.

741
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:28,330
Us Toads do things
with a bit more dash.

742
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:31,566
A bit more zing.

743
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:33,938
Toad!

744
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,977
- Yes?
- Good luck. Toad.

745
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,138
Oh. Right! Thanks a lot.

00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:11,973
- Ha!
- [Gasps]

748
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,549
If it isn't my sweetheart.

749
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:16,812
Would you like a cup of tea?

750
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,854
- Where's my kiss?
- Kiss?

751
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:22,448
- I'll give you a thump.
- But you always give me a kiss.

752
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:26,221
- You must be mad.
- You're not quite yourself today. Are you. Granny?

753
00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:29,526
[Laughs] On the contrary.
I'm more myself than usual today.

754
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:31,827
- How's that?
- Because when I'm really myself...

755
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:35,336
- Yes?
- I give cheeky guards something special.

756
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:38,840
- And what is that?
- My warmest regards.

757
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,206
- [Steam Hissing]
- Aaah!

758
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:44,143
Oh. Cripes! Ooh!

759
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:08,864
Stop! Escaped... prisoner!
Stop!

00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:19,079

Stop right there!
[Laughing]

765
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,303
You can't escape.

766
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:47,070
Oh! Nincompoops!

767
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,906
Ah. That is gross.

768
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,416
Disgusting. Ugh!

769
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,990
- Oh. Hello. You fellows.
- [Alarm Blaring]

770

[Alarm Continues]

772
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:12,368
[Rat] Why on earth did you insist
on escaping on your own?

773
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:14,664
You don't think I'd stay there
twiddling my thumbs...

774
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:17,535
while the weasels blow up
Toad Hall. Do you?

775
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:19,574
No. No. Of course not.

First class is five
and nine pence each. Granny.

779
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,822
Five and nine pence?

780
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,824
Oh-ho. That's nothing to me.
I can assure you.

781
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,724
I've got it right here... in my...

782
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:40,729
pocket.

783
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:42,890
Do get a move on. Madam.

784
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:47,333
Look here. My man. Give me the tickets
now and I'll send the money on tomorrow.

785
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:50,372
- Next. Please.
- This is an emergency!

786

Excuse me. Madam.

What are we
going to do. Ratty?

794
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:35,208
I'll never see Toad Hall again
except in a heap of rubble.

Oh. Oh. Oh!

Oh. Oh. Oh!

I'm so sorry. Madam.
I didn't see you there.

798
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:50,623
I'm a poor old tea lady
who's lost all her money.

I'll lose my home as well.

No. Don't stop the train. Good.
Kindhearted Mr. Engine driver.

819

You'd better tell me
what's goin' on.

Alas. I'm not the simple
tea lady I appear to be.

And we are certainly
not his children.

I am a Toad. The well-known and popular
Mr. Toad. A landed proprietor.

- And who are they?
- My evil. Haughty tormenters...

borrow a motorcar.

- I don't hold with motorcars.
- Neither do I.

They've no respect for
public transport. That lot.

00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:55,256
All they care about is motorcars.

I'll show them.

837
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:16,801
I'll teach you to shoot at my train!

838
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:19,073
Ow!

839
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:21,116

- [Conductor] Headlight flashers!
- Look out!

842
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:32,993
I'll show you road lovers...

843
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:37,327
Hey! Hey! Hey!
You bring back my train. You!

844
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:39,402
We've lost the driver.

845
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:44,269
Yippie! Hoo-hoo-hoo!
I found it. I found it!

846
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:47,002
- What. The brake?
- No. The accelerator.

847
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:50,079
- Yah! [Whooping]
- Toad. No!

848
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:56,918
Leave it to me. I'll get 'em.

849
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:03,258
Ow!

850
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,193
- Ooh!
- Keep me covered. Moley.

851
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:09,322
I can't throw for toffee.

852
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:11,866
Just throw it.

853
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:14,436
- Eighty miles an hour!
- [Whistle Toots]

854
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:20,499
- Ow!
- Sorry!

855
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:25,012
Eighty-four miles an hour. Eighty-five!
I wonder if it'll go a hundred!

856
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:34,088
- Look out!
- Drop that or I'll shoot.

857
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:37,819
- I wonder what that does.
- I have given you the official warnin'!

- [Screaming]

859
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:43,765
- It's the brake.
- Toad!

860
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:49,437
- Mole. Come and give me a hand.
- I can't!

861
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:52,133
Yes. You can. Mole.

862
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:58,077
Come on!

863
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:02,675

Why won't it go any faster?

Oh. Come on. Come on!
Hee-hee!

875
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:47,361
I'm so sorry. Ratty.

876

You did your best. Moley.

[Toad]
Hoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo!

878
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:55,336

d That elusive Mr. Toad dd

892
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:10,911
Right. We'd better go
and find Badger.

893
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:11,748
That way...

894
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:12,942
That way...

895
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:15,415

Moley.

898
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:24,286
I'm not brave like you. Ratty...

899
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,954
or strong and fierce like Badger.

900
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,395
You are very brave. Moley.

901
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:33,065
I'm just a spineless nobody.

902
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:35,831
- You don't want someone like me as a friend.
- Moley.

903
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:38,737
I'm going home. Ratty. I'm sorry.

904
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:41,876
Moley!

905
00:59:49,185 --> 00:59:52,245
Oh! Ouch! Bother.

906

Oooh!

907
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:01,996
- Going home. Are we. Toad?
- Yes.

908
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:05,329
Better hurry.
I'll be setting soon.

909
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:07,835
How far is it to Toad Hall?

910
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:10,997
Oh. A long way yet.

[Groaning]

912
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:16,078
Yes. I can see everything
from up here.

913

That's the great thing about being... the sun.
[Chuckling]

914
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:26,219
Can you see what
those weasels are up to?

915
01:00:26,322 --> 01:00:30,656
They're putting the dynamite
into Toad Hall.

916
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:33,024
Dynamite.

917
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:37,293
Ohh. I'm beginning to set.

918

[Sobbing]
All is lost. Wretched Toad.

919
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,799
Shouldn't have gone around
stealing motorcars.

920
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:45,464
- Didn't.
- Did.

921
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:49,875
- Didn't!
- I saw it all! Did.

922
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:53,039

- Not until it's time.

Oh. Yipes! It's you lot.

931
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:26,980
Toad. What are you
doing out of jail?

932
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:30,052
Hmph! I escaped by great daring
and cleverness.

933
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:32,951
And I demand you hand back
Toad Hall immediately.

934
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:36,753
- Of course. It's all yours.
- Oh.

935
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:40,260
We were just looking after it for you.
Toady. While you were in jail.

936
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:42,263
- Oh. Thanks.
- Toad?

937
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:44,731
- Yes?
- Why are you dressed like this?

938
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:47,962
Oh. Master of disguise.
Fooled everyone.

939
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:50,266
You're a clever one
and no mistake, Toad.

940
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,637
Yes. Drove a train. Just like that.

941
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:57,236
Did you? Well. We've got a new motor
we'd like you to... test for us.

942
01:01:57,346 --> 01:01:59,246
A new motor? Oh. Rather!

943
01:01:59,348 --> 01:02:02,249
- It's got a motor.
- Sort of experimental. Is it?

944
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:05,218
- That's it.
- Oh. Yipes!

Tomorrow. Toad Hall.

No.

951
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:55,831
No. I can't have that.

How's it work?

01:03:16,759 --> 01:03:18,954
Let me show you. Toad.

955
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:23,930
This motor drives...
this wheel here.

956
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:27,400
That turns the axle
attached to which...

957
01:03:27,503 --> 01:03:29,562
are these blades here.

958
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:32,266
- Oh. Yes. I see.
- They rotate...

959
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:37,574
and the screw squeezes the raw material
through those holes.

960
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,376
Oh. Sort of mincing machine. Is it?

961
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:42,474
Smart fellow.

962
01:03:42,585 --> 01:03:45,486
Yes. Always was quick
on the uptake.

963
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:48,489

expecting anyone.

are you doing there?

Oh. Dear. You can get that off
with a little bit of salt.

and stupid Toad.

Henceforth,
I will be very different.

1181
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:50,791
No more boasting. No more fads.

1182
01:22:50,899 --> 01:22:53,197
I know now there's more to life
than motorcars.

1183
01:22:53,301 --> 01:22:55,633
I certainly hope so.
