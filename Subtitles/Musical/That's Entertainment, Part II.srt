2
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:29,532
- You get anything ?
- No.

3
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,439
My knight in shining
German armor has arrived.

4
00:00:40,453 --> 00:00:42,495
See if he has room for two.

5
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,460
Hey. You wanna party ?

6
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,404
It's only been a few hours.

7
00:01:07,418 --> 00:01:10,225
Dakota always calls me. We have a system.

8
00:01:10,226 --> 00:01:11,239
Something is wrong.

9
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,979
Why don't you go home, Jersey ?

10
00:01:12,993 --> 00:01:17,495
Eat something for once, get some sleep.

11
00:01:35,312 --> 00:01:36,992
Hello, Dad.

12
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,499
Ellie.

13
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,396
Are you okay ?

14
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,206


15
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,986
Hey, Sheriff.

16
00:02:20,987 --> 00:02:22,866
I'm glad I caught you.

17
00:02:24,474 --> 00:02:26,933
I got to take some emergency leave.

18
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:29,311
It's a... It's a family matter.

19
00:02:29,325 --> 00:02:30,904
I didn't know you had a family.

20
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:32,052
Well, you're new.

21
00:02:32,053 --> 00:02:34,213
We haven't had a chance to talk.

22
00:02:34,227 --> 00:02:37,002
I briefed my lieutenant on my cases.

23
00:02:37,016 --> 00:02:38,720
He'll cover for me for a couple of days.

24
00:02:38,721 --> 00:02:40,732
This is not a good time for family problems.

25
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:43,110
All the Narco guys are at a HIDTA conference.

26
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:44,101
I got no backup.

27
00:02:44,102 --> 00:02:45,507
I'm still learning the ropes here.

28
00:02:45,508 --> 00:02:49,498
Well, it's never a good time to
have a family problem, Sheriff.

29
00:02:49,499 --> 00:02:51,492
Look, I don't ask for time off normally.

30
00:02:51,493 --> 00:02:52,934
I'd appreciate the courtesy.

31
00:02:52,935 --> 00:02:55,074
Do I have a choice here, Jim ?

32
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:57,718
Get back here as soon as you can.

33
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,622
- You look good, Jimmy.
- You do, too, Annie.

34
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,975
L.A. seems to agree with you.

35
00:03:49,976 --> 00:03:53,682
Yeah, well, I couldn't
take another Jersey winter.

36
00:03:53,683 --> 00:03:55,491
Or another Jersey cop.

37
00:03:55,505 --> 00:03:56,846
You stay in touch with the old crew ?

38
00:03:56,847 --> 00:03:59,993
You know, dirty cops don't
like to hang with clean ones.

39
00:03:59,994 --> 00:04:01,765
So that's why they called me squeaky ?

40
00:04:01,766 --> 00:04:03,898
I thought what you did took a lot of guts.

41
00:04:03,899 --> 00:04:08,846
Integrity is hard to come by in vice.

42
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,292
Yeah, it's the only detail
where you're told to drink,

43
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,958
gamble and pick up hookers,
all the while carrying a gun.

44
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:14,998
Garden of Eden.

45
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:18,985
Temptation kills you, or it compromises you.

46
00:04:18,986 --> 00:04:20,467
So, you got my message ?

47
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:23,116
My daughter Ellie and her
friend Dakota were out partying

48
00:04:23,117 --> 00:04:24,696
and Dakota got in some guy's car.

49
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,637
Ellie was able to pull a partial.

50
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:29,801
Something about a whale tail.

51
00:04:29,815 --> 00:04:32,358
California Coastal
Commission specialty plates.

52
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:36,473
I'll run it through DMV.
Cross reference with BMWs.

53
00:04:36,474 --> 00:04:39,429
In the meantime, I pulled Dakota's rap sheet.

54
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,439
- She has a sheet ?
- They both do.

55
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,954
She works a stretch on Hollywood
Boulevard between Highland and Vine.

56
00:04:50,968 --> 00:04:53,419
When was the last time you saw Ellie, Jimmy ?

57
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,701
About three years ago.

58
00:04:54,702 --> 00:04:56,235
She got into some trouble in Vegas.

59
00:04:56,249 --> 00:04:57,769
Hanging around with a bad bunch.

60
00:04:57,783 --> 00:05:02,064
Looks like her taste in
people hasn't changed much.

61
00:05:05,284 --> 00:05:07,023
Last known address.

62
00:05:08,037 --> 00:05:10,055
In case you don't have it.

63
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,529
- Ellie, it's your dad.
- How'd you get this number ?

64
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,211
Relax, take it easy.

65
00:05:52,225 --> 00:05:53,994
I got it off caller I.D.

66
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:56,382
So did you make the call ?

67
00:05:56,383 --> 00:05:59,799
- Yeah. LAPD's looking into it.
- Thanks.

68
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,165
Hey, how are you doing ?

69
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,004
Great, actually.

70
00:06:03,018 --> 00:06:05,461
Livin' at the beach, temping, waiting tables.

71
00:06:05,462 --> 00:06:07,566
Got some really good friends.

72
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,991
It's a big bowl of cherries.

73
00:06:17,954 --> 00:06:21,010
I'll call you when I hear
something, all right ?

74
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,334
We found the beemer.

75
00:06:33,348 --> 00:06:36,041
Found these two kids trying to hot wire it.

76
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:40,267
Whale Tail license plate
starting with 1-T-A.

77
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:44,377
- Let's talk to them.
- I'll talk, you listen.

78
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,909
All right, what the hell's
the matter with you ?

79
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,136
You looking to die young ?

80
00:06:49,137 --> 00:06:51,360
'Cause you can do it
inside in lock-up or outside

81
00:06:51,361 --> 00:06:54,286
with this wanna-be gang
ban er stealing cars crap.

82
00:06:54,287 --> 00:06:55,409
We weren't stealing nothing.

83
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,468
Window was already busted.

84
00:06:57,482 --> 00:06:59,002
Car wouldn't even start.

85
00:06:59,016 --> 00:07:00,477
We were just playing around.

86
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:02,267
You like playing with cars ?

87
00:07:02,281 --> 00:07:05,326
LAPD's having a car wash
fund-raiser on Saturday.

88
00:07:05,327 --> 00:07:07,165
You just signed yourselves up.

89
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:09,608
You're welcome. Come on.

90
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,201
So, no Rudy Giuliani
broken windows theory here ?

91
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,573
Jimmy, windows are already broken.

92
00:07:18,587 --> 00:07:20,546
Someone's got to fix 'em.

93
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,003
Hey, check this out.

94
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:30,453
B-H-G-C
?

95
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:32,349
Looks like a country club or something.

96
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,123
Doesn't read like Koreatown.

97
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:36,115
I'll have my guys run the plates.

98
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:39,925
- Anybody checked the trunk ?
- Not yet.

99
00:07:49,031 --> 00:07:51,210
Doesn't look good for Ellie's friend.

100
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,437
Glazer.

101
00:07:55,438 --> 00:07:57,156
Yeah, we're just finishing up.

102
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,460
No traffic, I'll be there
in about 20 minutes. Okay.

103
00:08:00,461 --> 00:08:03,996
Vegas ? You know a Jim Brass ?

104
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,854
Rick. Rick, what are you doing here ?

105
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,350
I'm here for the HIDTA conference.

106
00:08:23,351 --> 00:08:27,077
Buddy of mine from L.A.P.D. told me there
was a new captain in town, stirring things up.

107
00:08:27,078 --> 00:08:28,389
What are you doing here ?

108
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,134
Ah, it's a long sad story, man.

109
00:08:30,148 --> 00:08:33,062
Have anything to do with a
feisty little blonde named Ellie ?

110
00:08:33,063 --> 00:08:34,793
She's not a blonde anymore.

111
00:08:34,807 --> 00:08:36,825
Let's check out the car.

112
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,238
Captain Annie Kramer, this is
Warrick Brown from Las Vegas.

113
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:45,372
- Good to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

114
00:08:45,373 --> 00:08:49,370
Matt Glazer, L.A.P.D.
Crime Lab. Hey, Jim Brass.

115
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,559
I thought L.A. was all about car culture.

116
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,214
This reminds me of home.

117
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:58,058
Trunk's been stripped clean.

118
00:08:58,432 --> 00:08:59,981
Too clean.

119
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,319
They missed a spot.

120
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,747
Looks like two large caliber bullet holes.

121
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,374
But a bullet hole wouldn't
make those markings.

122
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,274
- What is that ?
- I don't know.

123
00:09:12,288 --> 00:09:14,718
Looks like a tool marking.

124
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,344
Let's haul it back to impound and find out.

125
00:09:21,521 --> 00:09:23,382
- I'll be in touch.
- Thanks.

126
00:09:23,446 --> 00:09:26,321
Hey, you know, Jim, I'm here all weekend.

127
00:09:26,322 --> 00:09:28,654
If you need anything, don't hesitate to call.

128
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:30,489
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Same here.

129
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,743
Remember, what happen in L.A., stays in L.A.

130
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:36,381
You still a Scotch man ?

131
00:09:38,466 --> 00:09:40,838
I'll take a rain check.

132
00:10:14,276 --> 00:10:17,221
Hey, baby, you want to party ?

133
00:10:19,106 --> 00:10:20,606
Ellie...

134
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:21,934
I can't ever trust you.

135
00:10:21,935 --> 00:10:23,743
All I did was ask you to make a call.

136
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,282
- How's the beach house ?
- Go to hell.

137
00:10:25,283 --> 00:10:27,490
I have information about your friend, Dakota.

138
00:10:27,491 --> 00:10:28,991
Get in.

139
00:10:32,012 --> 00:10:35,601
But I'm not playing 20 questions with you.

140
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,000
So, did you find her body ?

141
00:10:47,008 --> 00:10:48,117
No.

142
00:10:48,118 --> 00:10:49,353
But we found the car.

143
00:10:49,354 --> 00:10:50,638
So she could still be alive ?

144
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:52,776
We found blood in the trunk.

145
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,989
No, no, no, she's alive. I can feel it.

146
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,779
Look, do you have anything
with her DNA on it,

147
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,767
like a hair brush or toothbrush or... ?

148
00:10:59,768 --> 00:11:01,359
No. We keep all that stuff in our purse.

149
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,957
How about clothes or sheets
or pillowcases, like that ?

150
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,526
We share everything else.

151
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,469
Even the bed ?

152
00:11:07,862 --> 00:11:10,242
I told you I'm not playing that game.

153
00:11:10,256 --> 00:11:13,188
If the lab doesn't have anything to
match the blood to, then we'll never know.

154
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:14,689
That's it.

155
00:11:19,707 --> 00:11:21,675
Come on, let's get some dinner,

156
00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:23,207
You look hungry.

157
00:11:23,306 --> 00:11:24,788
Wait. Blood.

158
00:11:24,789 --> 00:11:28,442
We went and got tested last
week at the Free Clinic on Ivar.

159
00:11:28,443 --> 00:11:31,324
Maybe they keep it.

160
00:11:31,338 --> 00:11:33,266
Tested for what ?

161
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,008
What do you think ?

162
00:11:35,022 --> 00:11:37,907
Don't you use protection ?

163
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,940
Guys pay extra for bareback.

164
00:11:44,974 --> 00:11:46,779
You're a lot smarter
than that, Ellie. Come on.

165
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,933
Yeah, well, just because
you want me to be smarter

166
00:11:48,934 --> 00:11:51,167
and sweeter and safer doesn't mean I am.

167
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,545
And I got to go.

168
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:53,954
- Guess you know how to find me if you hear
anything. - Don't-Don't leave, don't leave.

169
00:11:53,955 --> 00:11:56,213
You're one to talk.

170
00:11:56,538 --> 00:11:58,840
All my life, that's all you did, walk out.

171
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:02,269
Now we're gonna Norman
Rockwell it ? Look around, Dad.

172
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,650
It's too late.

173
00:12:03,651 --> 00:12:05,355
- Don't leave.
- Leave me alone.

174
00:12:12,903 --> 00:12:16,583
Here at the clinic, we pride ourselves a
confidential relationship with our patients.

175
00:12:16,584 --> 00:12:18,157
This is a highly unusual request.

176
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:21,495
I understand, but we're investigating
a possible homicide here.

177
00:12:21,496 --> 00:12:23,225
We found blood in the trunk of a car.

178
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:26,192
We have reason to believe it could be
Sasha Reynolds', street name Dakota.

179
00:12:26,193 --> 00:12:28,777
We're not interested in whether
it's positive or negative.

180
00:12:28,778 --> 00:12:30,947
We need it for the DNA.

181
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,778
How many do you need ?

182
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:36,292
Ten.

183
00:12:37,392 --> 00:12:39,360
Twelve.

184
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,265
Is that all the help they get ?

185
00:12:50,266 --> 00:12:52,940
These kids come from all over the
place with stars in their eyes.

186
00:12:52,941 --> 00:12:55,594
While they're waiting to be discovered,
they still got to pay their rent.

187
00:12:55,595 --> 00:12:57,603
They do a bump to turn their first trick.

188
00:12:57,604 --> 00:13:00,532
Next they're turning tricks
to get their next bump.

189
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:02,033
We do what we can.

190
00:13:02,045 --> 00:13:03,558
You do what you do.

191
00:13:03,572 --> 00:13:05,822
Excuse me.

192
00:13:06,306 --> 00:13:07,984
Yeah. Kramer.

193
00:13:07,998 --> 00:13:09,498
Good luck.

194
00:13:10,216 --> 00:13:13,862
- Good luck to you, too, Doctor.
- You're kidding me.

195
00:13:15,124 --> 00:13:18,436
Terrific. Okay. We're on it. Bye.

196
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,389
We got an R.O. on the car.

197
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,641
- Captain Kramer.
- Hey, Todd.

198
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,191
What's up ?

199
00:13:51,192 --> 00:13:53,542
I stumbled across something.

200
00:13:53,556 --> 00:13:55,326
Thought I'd pay you a house call.

201
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,048
You missing a car ?

202
00:13:57,062 --> 00:13:59,822
Yeah, it was stolen.

203
00:13:59,836 --> 00:14:01,615
You didn't report it.

204
00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:03,879
No, I didn't.

205
00:14:03,893 --> 00:14:05,421
What's that about ?

206
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,300
Who are you ?

207
00:14:08,301 --> 00:14:12,999
I'm sorry, this is an old friend of
mine, Captain Jim Brass, Vegas P.D.

208
00:14:18,766 --> 00:14:20,715
Off the record ?

209
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,920
I went down the hill.

210
00:14:23,934 --> 00:14:26,045
I was...

211
00:14:26,527 --> 00:14:28,446
...lonely.

212
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:32,029
Partook of the services of
a certain kind of young lady.

213
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:36,554
And while we were getting
acquainted, I was carjacked.

214
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:39,988
I was set up.

215
00:14:39,989 --> 00:14:42,798
It was probably her pimp or drug dealer.

216
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,473
How'd you get up the hill ?

217
00:14:45,047 --> 00:14:46,147
Took a cab.

218
00:14:46,148 --> 00:14:47,363
They didn't take your wallet ?

219
00:14:47,364 --> 00:14:48,669
The car was worth more than the cash.

220
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,715
They knew what they were doing.

221
00:14:49,716 --> 00:14:52,467
It's a pretty sweet ride.

222
00:14:52,481 --> 00:14:55,573
I'm still hung up on
why you didn't report it.

223
00:14:55,574 --> 00:14:57,471
Captain, maybe I should introduce myself.

224
00:14:57,472 --> 00:15:00,562
Todd Piccone, Assistant City Attorney.

225
00:15:00,563 --> 00:15:03,548
Let's just say that my reputation
is worth more than my car.

226
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:07,732
Then maybe you should stop
having dates in your front seat.

227
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:09,204
You're right.

228
00:15:09,205 --> 00:15:10,963
Lesson learned.

229
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:13,467
Thank you, Officer.

230
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,334
So the car was stripped, I'm sure...

231
00:15:17,627 --> 00:15:19,974
South Central ? Koreatown ? East L.A. ?

232
00:15:19,975 --> 00:15:21,126
Koreatown.

233
00:15:21,127 --> 00:15:22,307
How would you know that ?

234
00:15:22,308 --> 00:15:25,202
'Cause, Captain, that's where
good cars go to die in Los Angeles.

235
00:15:25,203 --> 00:15:28,756
Hey, Todd, I don't suppose
we could take a look around ?

236
00:15:28,757 --> 00:15:31,058
You know, I'm expecting company.

237
00:15:31,072 --> 00:15:33,254
Now's not a good time.

238
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:38,752
We need to get a warrant
to get into that house.

239
00:15:38,753 --> 00:15:40,058
Well, we don't have enough.

240
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:41,559
Enough for a city attorney ?

241
00:15:41,563 --> 00:15:42,944
You know, give me a break.

242
00:15:42,945 --> 00:15:45,379
You know how many cars get
jacked in L.A. every day ?

243
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,812
He admitted to being with a prostitute.

244
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:50,649
What makes you think he's not
telling the truth about the rest ?

245
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,895
He's hinky. I can feel it.

246
00:15:51,896 --> 00:15:54,201
Your gut can talk to my judge.

247
00:15:54,545 --> 00:15:56,584
Or better yet, talk to Ellie.

248
00:15:56,598 --> 00:15:57,849
You should.

249
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,385
You should get the
4-1-1 on Dakota from her.

250
00:16:00,386 --> 00:16:02,595
There's an unreliable witness.

251
00:16:04,652 --> 00:16:06,531
So what do we do now ?

252
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:10,207
We eat steak.

253
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,512
Tony, how are you doing ?

254
00:16:15,526 --> 00:16:18,686
Table for two, please,
in the back, if you could.

255
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,874
What are we doing here again ?

256
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,625
I'm doing you a big favor.

257
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,721
Annie, hello.

258
00:16:26,722 --> 00:16:28,394
Hey, Judge Peters. What a nice surprise.

259
00:16:28,395 --> 00:16:30,047
- Nice to see you.
- Good to see you.

260
00:16:30,048 --> 00:16:31,478
How's that porterhouse ?

261
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:32,971
Eh, I haven't started yet.

262
00:16:32,972 --> 00:16:35,024
Gentlemen, I'd like you to
meet an old friend of mine,

263
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:37,566
Captain Jim Brass, LVPD.

264
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,251
This is Judge Silvio
Peters, Councilman Joe Cohen.

265
00:16:40,252 --> 00:16:44,018
- Judge, Councilman.
- Comptroller Daniel Reichmann, and Vic Patterson.

266
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:45,185
Hey, Vic, how are you doing ?

267
00:16:45,186 --> 00:16:46,869
Soon to be Mayor.

268
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,626
Hey, you know what ?

269
00:16:49,627 --> 00:16:51,899
We shot a couple episodes
of my show in Vegas.

270
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,136
- You remember that ?
- Right.

271
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,268
The Eagle.

272
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:55,219
Yeah, you guys were great.

273
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,581
You always treated us really well.

274
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:57,457
Well, we try.

275
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,190
Remember how great he was as that cop ?

276
00:16:59,191 --> 00:17:00,963
Like he was playing you.

277
00:17:00,977 --> 00:17:03,016
Well, that's not easy.

278
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,186
Listen, since I happened to run into you...

279
00:17:06,187 --> 00:17:09,062
We found Todd Piccone's
car just off of Vermont.

280
00:17:09,063 --> 00:17:11,716
Had bullet holes and blood in the trunk.

281
00:17:11,717 --> 00:17:14,176
He claims it was stolen, but I'm hoping

282
00:17:14,177 --> 00:17:16,797
that I could get a look
around his house a bit

283
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:17,445
You know what ?

284
00:17:17,446 --> 00:17:19,347
Let me get you an autograph or something.

285
00:17:19,348 --> 00:17:20,911
Little something for me.

286
00:17:21,897 --> 00:17:23,916
And a little something for you.

287
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,431
If you had enough for a
warrant, you wouldn't be here.

288
00:17:27,432 --> 00:17:31,317
You'd be on your cell phone,
calling me from Tommy Burger.

289
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,668
Finish your steak before it gets cold.

290
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:35,589
There you are.

291
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,649
I'm touched. Thank you, man. Thank you.

292
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,672
- Gentlemen.
- Enjoy your lunch, gentlemen.

293
00:17:39,673 --> 00:17:41,185
- Nice to see you.
- You as well.

294
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,684
Strike one, your turn.

295
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:09,532
Well, if it isn't Dick Tracy and
his little sidekick, Nancy Drew.

296
00:18:09,533 --> 00:18:13,056
We're here on official
business. Just let us in.

297
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:14,632
Vote Vic Patterson.

298
00:18:14,684 --> 00:18:16,668
Put some action back in government.

299
00:18:16,973 --> 00:18:19,697
Vic Patterson has a plan for Los Angeles.

300
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,673
He wants to restore trust in City Hall.

301
00:18:21,674 --> 00:18:26,032
Vic Patterson has the energy it takes
to get Los Angeles back on track !

302
00:18:26,576 --> 00:18:28,556
You and Dakota have the same pimp ?

303
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,722
No. We don't have a pimp. We're independent.

304
00:18:30,723 --> 00:18:32,223
I can see that.

305
00:18:32,572 --> 00:18:36,826
Look, if she were gonna pull a con
with some guy, who would it be ?

306
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,749
She's not like that.

307
00:18:38,763 --> 00:18:42,965
So other than her customers,
there's, what ? No men in her life ?

308
00:18:43,469 --> 00:18:45,659
You and she are...

309
00:18:46,649 --> 00:18:48,308
Roommates.

310
00:18:48,322 --> 00:18:50,902
Look, you can be cute, or you
can help us find your friend.

311
00:18:50,903 --> 00:18:52,094
What's it gonna be ?

312
00:18:52,095 --> 00:18:54,401
Well, there's this guy
named Ronnie, all right ?

313
00:18:54,402 --> 00:18:56,042
He was kind of like her boyfriend.

314
00:18:56,056 --> 00:18:58,350
Sometimes he would get
jealous when she turned tricks.

315
00:18:58,351 --> 00:19:01,228
Where do we find this Casanova ?

316
00:19:03,452 --> 00:19:06,235
Look, you know I can't go in there
without probable cause or a warrant.

317
00:19:06,236 --> 00:19:10,041
You're not gonna arrest me for
breaking and entering, are you ?

318
00:19:10,042 --> 00:19:12,224
Jimmy, what are you hoping to find in there ?

319
00:19:12,225 --> 00:19:14,364
I'll know it when I see it.

320
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:23,795
Smelled something in the hallway.
That's why we broke in, right ?

321
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:26,987
L.A. has over 200 criminalists.
You got to bring your own guy ?

322
00:19:26,988 --> 00:19:29,337
Well, Rick is like a vampire.

323
00:19:29,351 --> 00:19:30,999
He needs to be invited in.

324
00:19:31,013 --> 00:19:34,521
If this goes to court, Warrick's
going to have to come back and testify.

325
00:19:34,522 --> 00:19:36,972
Well, you got beaches, bikinis.

326
00:19:36,986 --> 00:19:39,091
Free trip to L.A. ? I'm down.

327
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:46,248
So we got coffee filters, cough
medicine, matches, camping fuel...

328
00:19:46,672 --> 00:19:48,073
hot plates.

329
00:19:48,074 --> 00:19:49,484
Are you thinking what I'm thinking ?

330
00:19:49,485 --> 00:19:54,370
If this is a meth lab, then there would
be free iodine coated all over these walls.

331
00:19:54,384 --> 00:19:57,042
And if Matt packed this kit right,

332
00:19:57,056 --> 00:20:00,377
I would have some spray starch...

333
00:20:02,643 --> 00:20:06,303
...that would react with the iodine.

334
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,179
Turning it a nice Dodger blue.

335
00:20:19,565 --> 00:20:21,915
Yes, it's a meth lab.

336
00:20:43,413 --> 00:20:47,117
So meth dealer and his hooker
girlfriend looking for a quick score.

337
00:20:47,118 --> 00:20:49,618
Carjacking's not such a stretch.

338
00:20:49,632 --> 00:20:52,447
Neighbors are lucky he didn't
blow the whole building up.

339
00:20:52,448 --> 00:20:54,105
No guns, no blood.

340
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:58,321
Nothing in plain sight linking
him to Dakota's disappearance.

341
00:20:58,335 --> 00:21:00,386
Well, we'll haul him in on manufacturing.

342
00:21:00,387 --> 00:21:02,478
We'll get what we can out of him.

343
00:21:02,492 --> 00:21:06,016
Jail would be an improvement over this hole.

344
00:21:06,241 --> 00:21:08,389
Drop the gun! Now!

345
00:21:08,403 --> 00:21:10,175
- Put the gun down.
- Bad guys go away.

346
00:21:10,176 --> 00:21:12,206
- Put the gun down.
- You're trying to rob me ?

347
00:21:12,207 --> 00:21:14,339
- Drop the gun!
- I'm being robbed by cops ?

348
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,018
You're trying to rob me !

349
00:21:16,032 --> 00:21:18,612
Don't make me shoot you.

350
00:21:19,832 --> 00:21:22,362
Put the gun down.

351
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,200
Come on.

352
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,034
How long has the body been here ?

353
00:21:40,138 --> 00:21:42,236
About three and a half hours now.

354
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,348
Jogger found her, called it in.

355
00:21:55,362 --> 00:21:57,630
Description matched your broadcast.

356
00:22:02,515 --> 00:22:05,973
Looks like body gas has
brought her to the top.

357
00:22:05,974 --> 00:22:08,026
God, somebody beat the pulp out of her.

358
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:08,977
Any leads ?

359
00:22:08,978 --> 00:22:11,347
Yeah, he's detoxing in the tank.

360
00:22:11,361 --> 00:22:16,113
This is why I don't believe in easy money.

361
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:18,331
You have to identify the body.

362
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:28,694
- I'm going to be sick.
- No, come here.

363
00:22:28,695 --> 00:22:30,614
Look, I just need an answer.

364
00:22:31,561 --> 00:22:33,349
Is this your friend ?

365
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,106
Family business ?

366
00:22:50,107 --> 00:22:52,970
That is a wedding or a
funeral, or a bar mitzvah.

367
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:57,193
That is not permission to become
a vice cop in another jurisdiction.

368
00:22:57,207 --> 00:22:58,458
Get back here now.

369
00:22:58,459 --> 00:23:00,466
- Who you been talking to ?
- Not that it matters.

370
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:03,129
The police chief called me
after Judge Peters called him.

371
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:06,225
I hear they do a niceT-bone at Musso's.

372
00:23:06,226 --> 00:23:08,065
Look, my kid's in trouble, Ben.

373
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:11,161
Well, if she's not dead,
you get your ass back here.

374
00:23:11,162 --> 00:23:13,113
Look, write me up for insubordination.

375
00:23:13,114 --> 00:23:15,243
I can't come back now.

376
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,900
You have a prior.

377
00:23:25,957 --> 00:23:28,343
Mandatory minimum for manufacturing...

378
00:23:28,344 --> 00:23:29,922
ten to 15.

379
00:23:29,936 --> 00:23:34,549
You start to talk about Dakota,
we'll see what we can do.

380
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:41,273
Now, what that crazy
bitch got to do with this ?

381
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,528
What ? She snitched on me ?

382
00:23:43,542 --> 00:23:45,859
- Not before you killed her.
- I didn't kill nobody.

383
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,539
You have a relationship with her ?

384
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:49,553
Yeah, we kicked it, all right ? We kicked it.

385
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:53,551
Look, I would never kill no
girl with all that good...

386
00:23:54,326 --> 00:23:59,455
All right, look, let's just say I enjoyed
having her live downstairs from me, man.

387
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:04,990
She knew when to open her mouth
and when to keep it closed.

388
00:24:06,621 --> 00:24:08,369
Now, her girl, Jersey...

389
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,126
God, the best mouth I ever had.

390
00:24:14,812 --> 00:24:16,900
That mouth gave me a lot of pleasure.

391
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:19,804
It just never stopped.

392
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,878
Where were you two nights ago ?

393
00:24:22,892 --> 00:24:25,602
- Out.
- Be more specific!

394
00:24:25,616 --> 00:24:27,553
I-I-I was seeing
customers, all right ?

395
00:24:27,554 --> 00:24:28,583
- Dakota ?
- No.

396
00:24:28,584 --> 00:24:29,627
You like BMWs ?

397
00:24:29,628 --> 00:24:30,959
Bitch, what the f... ?

398
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,749
what are you talking about ?!

399
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:34,451
Watch your mouth!

400
00:24:35,926 --> 00:24:38,476
I'll lay it out for you.

401
00:24:39,877 --> 00:24:41,377
Come on, man. All right.

402
00:24:43,722 --> 00:24:45,561
So, how was he ?

403
00:24:45,575 --> 00:24:46,615
What do you mean ?

404
00:24:46,616 --> 00:24:48,394
You wasn't supposed to do him.

405
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,604
You want me to admit to
a murder I didn't commit

406
00:24:59,605 --> 00:25:02,115
so you can reduce a drug charge ?

407
00:25:03,183 --> 00:25:05,354
What ? You're high, right ?

408
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:08,517
Y-Y-You
must be high.

409
00:25:19,045 --> 00:25:21,622
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

410
00:25:28,147 --> 00:25:29,647
What did he say ?

411
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:31,363
Dad ?

412
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,495
You were right; I shouldn't have come.

413
00:25:34,496 --> 00:25:37,736
I told you he didn't do it. It was
that guy in the car go and find him.

414
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:38,837
Don't you understand ?

415
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:42,525
We just pulled your best
friend out of a lake.

416
00:25:42,526 --> 00:25:44,762
I mean, it was just luck it wasn't you.

417
00:25:44,763 --> 00:25:46,845
- Yeah, well, it wasn't me.
- Yeah, not today.

418
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:48,327
But look at you.

419
00:25:48,328 --> 00:25:51,702
You've turned yourself into
a disposable human being.

420
00:25:51,703 --> 00:25:52,843
Don't you get it ?

421
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:55,588
You're nothing but plumbing.

422
00:25:56,798 --> 00:25:59,240
What ? You're going to send
me to my room and ground me ?

423
00:25:59,241 --> 00:26:01,813
Have a patrol car pick me up at prom ?

424
00:26:01,814 --> 00:26:03,863
Or spank me ?

425
00:26:03,877 --> 00:26:05,281
You're right.

426
00:26:05,282 --> 00:26:06,909
You're right.

427
00:26:06,923 --> 00:26:08,423
I messed up.

428
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:13,255
But I'm just trying to
do the best that I can.

429
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:18,690
I wish you could say the same thing.

430
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,964
Clothes test positive for lead wipe.

431
00:26:34,978 --> 00:26:36,377
Confirmed bullet hole.

432
00:26:36,378 --> 00:26:39,120
Did her DNA match the blood
that you swabbed from the trunk ?

433
00:26:39,121 --> 00:26:42,206
Yeah, but the autopsy
report said she wasn't shot.

434
00:26:42,207 --> 00:26:44,855
So, what's with the bullet holes ?

435
00:26:46,318 --> 00:26:47,818
Clean-up.

436
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,664
One bullet exited.

437
00:27:00,665 --> 00:27:03,338
Is the other hole to the
left or to the right ?

438
00:27:03,339 --> 00:27:07,405
About seven and a half, eight inches up.

439
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,716
That's the gas tank.

440
00:27:43,434 --> 00:27:45,010
Looks like a .45.

441
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,813
Big, fat and slow.

442
00:27:46,827 --> 00:27:50,226
Lucky for us, it didn't have enough power
to go through-and-through the gas tank.

443
00:27:50,227 --> 00:27:52,385
Yeah. Look at that.

444
00:27:52,929 --> 00:27:55,477
No wonder those hood rats
couldn't get the car started.

445
00:27:55,478 --> 00:27:56,703
It won't run on blood.

446
00:27:56,704 --> 00:27:59,322
Well, that tweaker you busted just
got bumped off the top of the list.

447
00:27:59,323 --> 00:28:00,543
He had a nine millimeter.

448
00:28:00,544 --> 00:28:02,285
You think you could run this through IBIS ?

449
00:28:02,286 --> 00:28:04,594
We do have that here.

450
00:28:07,434 --> 00:28:10,121
Hey, Doc, did you get my fax ?

451
00:28:10,135 --> 00:28:11,074
Yeah, I did.

452
00:28:11,075 --> 00:28:13,625
Yeah, well, it's all Greek to me.

453
00:28:13,639 --> 00:28:14,559
Can you help me out ?

454
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,789
Mmm, sure, of course.

455
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,543
But I thought you were asked to come home.

456
00:28:17,544 --> 00:28:18,623
I'll be home tomorrow.

457
00:28:18,624 --> 00:28:20,105
I hope she was worth it.

458
00:28:20,106 --> 00:28:21,017
What do you mean ?

459
00:28:21,018 --> 00:28:23,155
I don't know ; I mean, you
put your career on the line.

460
00:28:23,156 --> 00:28:24,826
I assume there's a woman involved.

461
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,169
What are you, a detective now ?

462
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:29,664
All right ; let's take a look at this.

463
00:28:29,665 --> 00:28:33,571
FX, OC... That's a
fractured osseocartilaginous.

464
00:28:33,572 --> 00:28:35,400
That's a broken nose.

465
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:39,072
FX, ST, CL... Sternal clavicle,

466
00:28:39,086 --> 00:28:43,730
and LAC, SDH on her head. Lacerations

467
00:28:43,744 --> 00:28:45,393
and subdural hematomas.

468
00:28:45,407 --> 00:28:46,336
Cause of death ?

469
00:28:46,337 --> 00:28:47,837
It looks like exsanguination.

470
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,790
So, she was beaten and left to die ?

471
00:28:49,804 --> 00:28:51,793
Beaten with something specific.

472
00:28:51,807 --> 00:28:56,043
The L.A. coroner noted
repetitive patterned contusions.

473
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,120
Anything else ?

474
00:28:59,121 --> 00:29:04,536
Yeah, the coroner's assistant who
prepped her body collected a green,

475
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,469
waxy substance under her fingernails.

476
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:12,991
Also, looks like he found concrete
chunks in a bag tied to her waist.

477
00:29:13,005 --> 00:29:17,416
Probably what they used to
weigh her down in the lake.

478
00:29:20,155 --> 00:29:22,028
You want to say I told you so ?

479
00:29:22,042 --> 00:29:28,099
No. I just want it to be over
with and have a happy ending.

480
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,446
What the hell's going on ? What's up ?

481
00:29:34,447 --> 00:29:35,290
Sorry, Todd.

482
00:29:35,291 --> 00:29:37,048
We got the warrant ; we have to search.

483
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:38,983
You got to be kidding me. Wha... ?

484
00:29:40,592 --> 00:29:42,325
I just had the floors polished.

485
00:29:42,339 --> 00:29:44,756
Will you at least take
your shoes off, please ?

486
00:29:44,757 --> 00:29:47,378
I sleep in my shoes, Todd.

487
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,837
- This guy married ?
- No.

488
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,591
Anybody else's gaydar going off ?

489
00:30:00,663 --> 00:30:02,835
Well, he did have a
female hooker in his ride.

490
00:30:02,836 --> 00:30:04,997
Well, maybe he swings both ways.

491
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:09,863
Why, because he has this nice shag carpet ?

492
00:30:12,239 --> 00:30:13,847
This carpet's wet.

493
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,500
Yeah.

494
00:30:29,449 --> 00:30:30,826
That's a lot of blood.

495
00:30:30,827 --> 00:30:32,167
How much, you figure ?

496
00:30:32,168 --> 00:30:34,026
I don't know--
two, three pints ?

497
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,614
Nobody loses that much blood and lives.

498
00:30:36,615 --> 00:30:38,488
She died in this room.

499
00:30:38,502 --> 00:30:40,925
I don't think we'll be able
to get any DNA off this.

500
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:44,052
The carpet solvents probably
compromised the sample.

501
00:30:44,053 --> 00:30:45,530
She was beaten multiple times.

502
00:30:45,531 --> 00:30:49,406
There must be some spatter or cast-off.

503
00:31:01,264 --> 00:31:02,958
I can't get a clean read.

504
00:31:05,716 --> 00:31:06,756
You know what ?

505
00:31:06,757 --> 00:31:08,336
It's this metal surface.

506
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:11,005
It's giving us a false positive.

507
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,895
Does anyone see a remote ?

508
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,424
Yeah, got one right here.

509
00:31:19,438 --> 00:31:23,038
Could you hit the input button
until we find a blue screen ?

510
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,273
Look at that.

511
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:31,432
I'll get a sample for DNA.

512
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,453
Nice place.

513
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,528
Who needs three trash bins ?

514
00:31:45,702 --> 00:31:48,042
Someone with a lot of dirt.

515
00:31:50,812 --> 00:31:52,321
Big party.

516
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,300
Tequila.

517
00:31:54,793 --> 00:31:56,361
Whiskey.

518
00:31:57,787 --> 00:31:59,287
Gin.

519
00:32:01,151 --> 00:32:02,577
Absinthe.

520
00:32:02,578 --> 00:32:07,061
The coroner found green wax
under Dakota's fingernails.

521
00:32:11,383 --> 00:32:14,095
Yes, I solicited her.

522
00:32:14,109 --> 00:32:18,892
So, you admit to having sexual relations
with Sasha Reynolds, a.k.a. Dakota ?

523
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:22,699
But money changed hands ?

524
00:32:22,713 --> 00:32:25,034
I paid her $60.

525
00:32:25,048 --> 00:32:26,787
For what ?

526
00:32:26,801 --> 00:32:30,105
I drove her back to my house
and introduced her to a friend.

527
00:32:30,106 --> 00:32:32,352
And then ?

528
00:32:34,498 --> 00:32:37,979
I have no knowledge of
what happened after that.

529
00:32:42,074 --> 00:32:44,725
Does this friend have a name ?

530
00:32:46,011 --> 00:32:47,819
Mmm. A big one.

531
00:32:50,062 --> 00:32:54,945
You know, Todd, I think you're smart
enough to recognize consciousness of guilt.

532
00:32:55,771 --> 00:33:00,035
Blood in your house, in your car.

533
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:02,520
All of which was cleaned up.

534
00:33:03,285 --> 00:33:07,281
This friend worth going to prison for ?

535
00:33:08,128 --> 00:33:10,292
Turn off that mic.

536
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,840
Officer.

537
00:33:53,727 --> 00:33:55,667
He invoked.

538
00:34:11,277 --> 00:34:13,170
I wanted to catch you before you left.

539
00:34:13,171 --> 00:34:14,615
I got a look at the print results

540
00:34:14,616 --> 00:34:16,579
from the bottles that
we collected just before

541
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,237
I was escorted out and
asked to leave the lab.

542
00:34:18,238 --> 00:34:19,067
They say why ?

543
00:34:19,068 --> 00:34:20,982
No, but I think I know why.

544
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:23,379
It's like Chinatown, Jim.

545
00:34:24,694 --> 00:34:27,044
So visiting hours are over, Doctor.

546
00:34:27,058 --> 00:34:27,884
It's time to go.

547
00:34:27,885 --> 00:34:29,730
- What about Ellie ?
- What about her ?

548
00:34:29,731 --> 00:34:32,705
Well, she's the only one who can
I.D. Todd Piccone as the driver.

549
00:34:32,706 --> 00:34:35,681
Well, I couldn't get much out of Annie,
but I don't think Piccone killed Dakota...

550
00:34:35,682 --> 00:34:36,708
it wasn't his scene.

551
00:34:36,709 --> 00:34:38,266
I don't know. He's involved.

552
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,494
It's his house. It's his car. It's his party.

553
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,638
Who's going to believe a tweaker hooker ?

554
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,518
You better hope nobody, or
she'll be taking a dirt nap.

555
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,957
Hey, it's Ellie. Leave a message
and I'll get back at you when I can.

556
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:56,593
Yeah, Ellie, it's, it's your dad.

557
00:34:56,607 --> 00:34:58,967
Listen, you were right about the guy

558
00:34:58,981 --> 00:35:01,825
He's a pretty important person
with pretty important friends.

559
00:35:01,826 --> 00:35:04,718
So, do me a favor.

560
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,720
Don't go out tonight.

561
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,334
If Dakota had wax under her fingernails,

562
00:35:18,335 --> 00:35:21,861
I think she must have been
doing more than just pouring.

563
00:35:21,862 --> 00:35:23,451
Self defense ?

564
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,635
Who was she defending against ?

565
00:35:30,649 --> 00:35:32,381
From the prints that we got off the bottle,

566
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:34,723
I have a list of six suspects.

567
00:35:34,737 --> 00:35:36,787
Silvio Peters, Joe Cohen...

568
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,428
Wait a minute. Silvio Peters ?

569
00:35:38,442 --> 00:35:41,188
He's a judge. He's on the list ?

570
00:35:41,592 --> 00:35:46,192
Daniel Reichmann, Vic Patterson,
Todd Piccone, Parker Smythe.

571
00:35:46,206 --> 00:35:47,468
They're all in AFIS ?

572
00:35:47,469 --> 00:35:49,330
Yeah. I mean, you can be in
AFIS for a lot of reasons.

573
00:35:49,331 --> 00:35:52,467
After 9-11, anyone who works
in a government building.

574
00:35:52,468 --> 00:35:54,630
Right. I mean, doctors, lawyers, right.

575
00:35:54,631 --> 00:35:57,849
Or anyone who has a permit
to carry a concealed weapon.

576
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:59,671
You know what ?

577
00:36:11,892 --> 00:36:13,470
Hey, Nicky. Where are you ?

578
00:36:13,484 --> 00:36:15,146
Are you near a computer ?
Can you do me a favor ?

579
00:36:15,147 --> 00:36:16,825
Yeah, sure. How's the conference going ?

580
00:36:16,826 --> 00:36:18,136
It's intense.

581
00:36:18,137 --> 00:36:20,852
I have a list of suspects, all in AFIS.

582
00:36:20,853 --> 00:36:23,897
I want to know if any of them
have a permit to carry concealed.

583
00:36:23,898 --> 00:36:25,350
Okay, shoot.

584
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:33,931
Silvio Peters, Parker Smythe, Daniel
Reichmann, Todd Piccone, et Vic Patterson.

585
00:36:36,267 --> 00:36:37,767
Vic Patterson does.

586
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:39,930
Are we talking about "The Eagle" ?

587
00:36:39,944 --> 00:36:41,134
From that TV show ?

588
00:36:41,135 --> 00:36:43,379
Yeah. What kind of gun ?

589
00:36:43,393 --> 00:36:47,352
A .45, same kind he uses in
all his cheeseball shoot-outs.

590
00:36:47,353 --> 00:36:48,743
Can you give me anything else ?

591
00:36:48,744 --> 00:36:52,602
Yeah, I can run the serial number
through Automated Firearms Service,

592
00:36:52,603 --> 00:36:54,738
give you the history.

593
00:36:55,332 --> 00:36:57,881
Colt sold it to the Beverly Hills Gun Club,

594
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:03,653
who, in turn, sold it to "The
Eagle" on September 28, 1983.

595
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:11,607
If he shops there, maybe he shoots there.

596
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,941
You know, I'm just in
town for a couple of days.

597
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:18,829
It's always been a dream of mine to shoot
at the famous Beverly Hills Gun Club.

598
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,800
I wonder if I could get a day pass ?

599
00:37:20,814 --> 00:37:21,875
For Las Vegas's finest ?

600
00:37:21,876 --> 00:37:23,730
- Sure thing.
- Look...

601
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,690
Tell me something.

602
00:37:26,008 --> 00:37:27,988
You know, is it, is it true that,

603
00:37:28,002 --> 00:37:30,725
you know, the actor, Vic
Patterson, shoots here ?

604
00:37:30,726 --> 00:37:33,677
Not really supposed to give out member info.

605
00:37:33,983 --> 00:37:35,384
But between you and me ?

606
00:37:35,385 --> 00:37:36,881
The man is a damn fine shot.

607
00:37:36,882 --> 00:37:37,633
No kidding.

608
00:37:37,634 --> 00:37:40,308
Matter of fact, he won
several of our competitions.

609
00:37:40,309 --> 00:37:41,913
You want to rent or shoot your own ?

610
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,919
I'll shoot what Vic shoots.

611
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,835
You shooting, too ?

612
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:54,175
Nah, I'm just going to hang back.

613
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,682
Let him blow off some steam.

614
00:37:57,595 --> 00:37:59,154
Ain't that something ?

615
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,544
Yeah, it's something.

616
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:02,045
Right this way.

617
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,004
Hey, Jim. I just got your bullet.

618
00:38:14,788 --> 00:38:16,750
I'm running it through IBIS right now.

619
00:38:16,751 --> 00:38:19,284
Not gonna ask how you got it.

620
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,600
So, did you meet him ?

621
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,603
Did you get his autograph for me ?

622
00:38:30,617 --> 00:38:35,630
Actually I did, and if you get me a match.
you might be able to meet him at his trial

623
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:39,909
You would make his autograph
worth more ? Or less ?

624
00:38:40,419 --> 00:38:41,890
We got a match.

625
00:38:41,891 --> 00:38:44,890
Entered by Matt Glazer, LAPD.

626
00:38:44,904 --> 00:38:47,586
Recovered from a BMW gas tank.

627
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,099
Open investigation, homicide-related.

628
00:38:50,113 --> 00:38:51,323
Great, great.

629
00:38:51,324 --> 00:38:53,478
Thanks for all your help. Thank you.

630
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,436
Was that Nick ?

631
00:38:58,437 --> 00:39:00,766
Yeah. IBIS confirmed the match.

632
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,751
We're good to go.

633
00:39:01,752 --> 00:39:04,174
- So, where you been ?
- In Hollywood, thinking.

634
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,197
You know, even if Vic Patterson
did shoot up the car with his gun,

635
00:39:07,198 --> 00:39:09,028
that doesn't mean he killed Dakota.

636
00:39:09,042 --> 00:39:10,850
Just means he helped clean up.

637
00:39:10,864 --> 00:39:12,370
She wasn't shot. She was beaten.

638
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:15,118
Yeah. We need a murder
weapon to nail his ass.

639
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,835
I got these photos at a Hollywood
memorabilia shop for ten bucks.

640
00:39:20,754 --> 00:39:22,254
Who do you see ?

641
00:39:24,227 --> 00:39:25,667
A jackass.

642
00:39:25,668 --> 00:39:27,206
Look closer.

643
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:31,000
Look at the pistol grip... and The Eagle.

644
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:34,043
You know, these autopsy photos
I saw all got me thinking.

645
00:39:34,044 --> 00:39:38,598
This one. Look at the pattern contusions.

646
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:45,877
The gun is the murder weapon.

647
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,513
Stop it! Stop it!

648
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,507
About six months ago, this
strung-out hooker comes into the PD,

649
00:40:01,508 --> 00:40:02,669
beat to crap,

650
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:05,603
screaming that Vic Patterson had done it,

651
00:40:05,604 --> 00:40:09,159
and her wounds looked a lot like this.

652
00:40:09,402 --> 00:40:10,863
I figured it was her pimp,

653
00:40:10,864 --> 00:40:15,030
she was sniffing around for a settlement.

654
00:40:15,225 --> 00:40:17,514
Sent her home with an ice pack.

655
00:40:17,528 --> 00:40:22,116
I'm sorry. I knew you
thought this guy was a winner.

656
00:40:22,132 --> 00:40:26,613
I worked my whole life to sit
at the table with the big boys...

657
00:40:26,788 --> 00:40:30,291
only to find out that the food is poisoned.

658
00:40:30,292 --> 00:40:33,526
You know, the only record of this
investigation is in that envelope,

659
00:40:33,527 --> 00:40:37,342
and half the evidence collection
won't stand up in court,

660
00:40:37,343 --> 00:40:38,843
so it's your call.

661
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:43,160
How many years you got on ?

662
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:46,567
Eight back in Jersey, 15 here.

663
00:40:46,581 --> 00:40:49,880
Well, that's 23 combined.
That's a lot of innings.

664
00:40:50,925 --> 00:40:53,829
I mean, the worse they
can do is make you retire.

665
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:56,950
What am I gonna do then ? Knit ?

666
00:40:58,426 --> 00:41:00,962
This is it, Jimmy. This is all I got.

667
00:41:00,976 --> 00:41:05,397
Well, if it's all you got,
then you got to do it right.

668
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,350
Remember Mike O'Toole ?

669
00:41:10,364 --> 00:41:11,683
From Vice ?

670
00:41:11,684 --> 00:41:13,184
Of course I do.

671
00:41:15,009 --> 00:41:17,320
Broke my heart when I found out he was dirty.

672
00:41:17,321 --> 00:41:19,080
Yeah, he was a heartbreaker.

673
00:41:20,206 --> 00:41:22,173
Broke up my marriage.

674
00:41:24,611 --> 00:41:26,389
I thought I did that.

675
00:41:26,403 --> 00:41:30,259
Well, Nancy used our affair because
she was looking for a way out,

676
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,838
but for me...

677
00:41:31,852 --> 00:41:35,051
I mean,
I guess I'm old-fashioned.

678
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:39,656
You know, a bad marriage is better
than no marriage... I thought.

679
00:41:39,657 --> 00:41:41,022
And you thought a kid would help ?

680
00:41:41,023 --> 00:41:42,713
You see, that's the thing.

681
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,500
I didn't have a kid.

682
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:57,259
Yeah, you did.

683
00:41:59,328 --> 00:42:03,138
I don't see Mike O'Toole
out here helping her.

684
00:42:05,207 --> 00:42:07,998
I spent a good chunk of my
life looking the other way.

685
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:12,442
I mean, so much so that my neck got tired.

686
00:42:12,746 --> 00:42:14,514
So I, you know, I got a divorce.

687
00:42:14,528 --> 00:42:17,659
I... turned Mike and his crew in.

688
00:42:17,673 --> 00:42:20,143
Started over in Vegas.

689
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,372
Ellie.

690
00:42:25,525 --> 00:42:30,719
She's like the unfinished
business of all that.

691
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,087
So it's my neck now.

692
00:43:23,117 --> 00:43:28,822
