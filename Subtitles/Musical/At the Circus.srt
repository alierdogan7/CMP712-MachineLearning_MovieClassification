1
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,328
That's all, Gibraltar.

2
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,402
You keep on eating between meals,
you'll ruin your figure.

3
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,800
And if you keep on fooling around
that gorilla...

4
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,687
he'll ruin your figure.

5
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,960
He's a snob. Come on.

6
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,321
Jeff, even though Gibraltar likes you...

7
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,640
I wish you wouldn't
take so many chances with him.

8
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,846
Julie, if that would make you
worry about me...

9
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,602
I'd move right into the cage.

10
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,887
It might seem a little cramped
after that house of yours in Newport.

11
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,564
Newport? Where have I heard that before?

12
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,687
I remember.
That's something in my dim, dark past.

13
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,079
- Are you sure it's past?
- Positive.

14
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,208
You like running a circus, don't you?

15
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:29,088
I like everything about it. But everything.

16
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,683
That's what you say now...

17
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,967
but the smell of sawdust
can get awfully monotonous after a while.

18
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,280
Young lady, that's no way
to talk to your boss.

19
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,648
<i>Now the Wilson Wonder Circus presents</i>
<i>a sensationally new modern feature:</i>

20
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,728
<i>That outstanding star,</i>
<i>that exciting personality...</i>

21
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,448
<i>Miss Julie Randall!</i>

22
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,443
There's my cue.

23
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,843
Point killer.

24
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:59,089
<i>Step up and take a bow</i>

25
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,243
<i>Don't be modest, don't be shy</i>

26
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,926
<i>Show that thoroughbred look in your eye</i>

27
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,969
<i>Step up with grace and pride</i>

28
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,929
<i>Take that oompah, oompah, oompah</i>

29
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,798
<i>In your stride</i>

30
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,807
<i>Each heart begins to beat in rhyme</i>

31
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,082
<i>Oompah-pah, oomph in three-quarter time</i>

32
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,480
<i>Maidens swoon and ladies pine</i>

33
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,242
Wonderful, isn't she?

34
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,809
She's all right.

35
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,087
But whoever heard
of anyone singing with a horse act?

36
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,642
The audience likes it.

37
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,163
<i>Be gallant</i>

38
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,209
<i>Take a bow</i>

39
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,924
At this time,
presenting that muscular marvel...

40
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,887
the strongest man in the world:

41
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,961
Goliath the mighty!

42
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,762
And now the mighty Goliath...

43
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,559
will catch three 100-pound balls
shot from cannon.

44
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,409
I'll fix you!

45
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,289
Mr. Carter? Where's Mr. Carter?

46
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,281
Hello, Joe. What's new? Don't tell me now.

47
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,167
I got no time. I got to find Mr. Carter.

48
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,399
Hello, Nick. How's the wife?

49
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,004
Tell me later. I'm in a hurry.
I got to find Mr. Carter.

50
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,842
Hello, Sam, and that's all.

51
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,966
You see, Jeff, I'm in kind of a jam.

52
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,359
- Hey, Mr. Carter.
- Just a minute, Tony.

53
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,647
Something's come up.
I've got to have the $10,000 I loaned you.

54
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,448
But it isn't due until Saturday night.

55
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,521
That's right,
but unless you have it for me...

56
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:49,728
I'm afraid I'll have to take the circus over
to raise the money. I'm in an awful spot.

57
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,961
That won't be necessary, John.
I'll have your money for you tonight.

58
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,369
- You'll what?
- Hey, Mr. Carter.

59
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,918
Shut up. I'm talking. Did you say tonight?

60
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,843
Yes. With today's receipts,
I'll have enough to pay you off.

61
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,161
I'll give you your money
on the circus train tonight.

62
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:05,879
That's fine.

63
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,961
- lf you please, Mr. Carter.
- What is it?

64
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,769
- Can I have a month off next August?
- What for?

65
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,603
I just got word from my lawyer.
He got me a divorce.

66
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,365
And one month every year
I win the custody of my wife's parents.

67
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,766
Take it up with Mr. Wilson.

68
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:26,003
What's the matter, boss?
Carter making trouble for you?

69
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,002
He's doing the best he can.
But don't you worry about it, Tony.

70
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,125
You know what I say?

71
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,168
When you got business trouble,
best thing to do is get a lawyer.

72
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,003
Then you got more trouble,
but at least you have a lawyer.

73
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,399
- Thanks, Tony.
- You can count on me, boss.

74
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,527
I ain't got nothing,
but you can always have half.

75
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,120
Poor Jeff. He's in plenty trouble.

76
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,008
Trouble...

77
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,282
This will bring him pretty quick.

78
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,679
- It's a straight wire?
- I think I bent it a little.

79
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,641
- Let's see.
- What's the idea, reading my telegram?

80
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,967
- I've got to count the words, don't I?
- All right.

81
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,729
Ten words, 55 cents.

82
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,082
You got something a little cheaper?

83
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,799
We've got regular form telegrams
for congratulations. That's 25 cents.

84
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,927
That's fine. Send him:
"Congratulations. Just got a big case."

85
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,639
Sorry. Congratulatory messages
apply only to special occasions.

86
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,929
For example,
suppose somebody gets married.

87
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,325
- That's a quarter.
- It ain't worth it.

88
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:41,688
No. I mean, suppose your sister
had a baby. You'd send her a telegram.

89
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,647
What for? She'd know it.

90
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,769
Come on, please take my telegram.
Here's two bits.

91
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:14,083
That's right, Antonio.
Don't let anybody on except the crew.

92
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,730
I got a lot of money on the train tonight,
so be careful.

93
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,243
I watch like a hawk, boss.

94
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,639
Nobody gets on the train
unless he's got a badge.

95
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,961
You bet. Nobody gets on the train
unless they got the badge.

96
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,441
Miss Julie, she's in there.

97
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,965
Tony, you're a very valuable man.

98
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:37,482
Hello, Julie.
Coffee and doughnuts. A la carte.

99
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,208
Jeff, I'm terribly sorry to read...

100
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,804
- What kind of doughnuts do you want?
- The best.

101
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,323
You seem pretty chipper...

102
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,605
for a boy
that's just kissed a fortune goodbye.

103
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:49,646
It's been a tough struggle,
but the circus is finally showing a profit.

104
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,800
Tonight I'm paying Carter
the money I owe him.

105
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,846
Jeff, that's wonderful!

106
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,444
Now the show will be all yours again,
free and clear.

107
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:59,727
You turned me down before
because you said I had enough obligations.

108
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,688
Now the only thing
standing in the way of our marriage is you.

109
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,647
I don't know why
I let you keep stalling me.

110
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,200
I must be crazy. I ought to see a doctor.
Get me a doctor.

111
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:11,043
What's the matter? You ain't tasted it yet.

112
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,604
Jeff Wilson, any young man
as stubborn as you are...

113
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,043
should be taught a lesson.

114
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,928
And I guess it's up to me
to do the teaching.

115
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,167
When are we getting married?

116
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,966
When? Was I hearing things, Julie?
Did you really mean what you said?

117
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,644
- Every word of it, darling.
- We'll be married tonight.

118
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,766
We can't tonight. There isn't time.

119
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,762
We'll be married tomorrow.
Do you hear, Julie? Tomorrow.

120
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,043

Okay, Professor, where's your...
Miss Julie, it's you.

158
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,241
All right to get on the train? I got a badge.

159
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,843
Sure, Jeff. Okay.

160
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,965
Hey, mister. $18.75.

161
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,927
1875. That's what I thought.

162
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,319
The 1940 models run much smoother.

163
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:26,159
You'll think I'm on a scavenger hunt,
but I'm looking for Antonio Ferrelli.

164
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,844
Mr. Loophole, I'm sure glad to see you.

165
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,727
Tony. You old war-horse.

166
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,768
I haven't seen you
since I stopped taking Scott's Emulsion.

167
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,887
You know, I was afraid
you wasn't going to get here in time.

168
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,438
There, see? Another minute
and you'd miss the train.

169
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,964
But now that you're here
everything will be all right.

170
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:45,008
This is a big case.
You gonna make lots of money.

171
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,641
- This is your lucky day.
- I'll say it is.

172
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,129
Don't know what the trouble is...

173
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,247
but I'll straighten it out in no time.
See you inside.

174
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,843
Would you hold that train still
while I try to mount it?

175
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:59,240
I'm sorry. Nobody gets on the train
unless they got the badge.

176
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,286
- Badge?
- The badge, yeah.

177
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,647
You mean my Lone Ranger badge.

178
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,927
Sorry, they took it back.
I stopped eating the cereal.

179
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,763
- Now let me see your badge.
- I just haven't.

180
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,124
You no got the badge?

181
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,804
Quiet. The engineer
may be eavesdropping.

182
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,968
The circus is certainly lucky
to have you for a watchdog...

183
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,529
you old badger, you.

184
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,648
Where are you going?

185
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,925
I'm going to the laundry to get ironed out.
I'm roughdry now.

186
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,448
Hey, come here. I got an idea.

187
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,520
You know my boss Jeff Wilson?
He owns the circus. He'll give you a badge.

188
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,362
Say, that's fast thinking. I'll see him.

189
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,725
He'll give me a badge.
I'll get on the train. Fine.

190
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,278
- Where is Mr. Wilson?
- He's on the train.

191
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,889
On the train?

192
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,564
It was awfully nice of you
floating this case my way.

193
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:47,685
It's nothing.

194
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,089
If you hadn't sent for me...

195
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,638
I'd probably be home now
in a nice warm bedroom...

196
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,085
in a comfortable bed, with a hot toddy.

197
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,161
- That's a drink.
- That's too bad.

198
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,163
If it was up to me,
I'd let you on the train like that.

199
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,527
But it's not up to me.

200
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,402
No, but it's up to my ankles.

201
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,641
Tadpole, you better get out of the water.
You're gonna get wet.

202
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,449
Nonsense. If I was any drier, I'd drown.

203
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,760
You better get out of the dampness,
my friend.

204
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,089
Sure, you're my friend.
My very best friend.

205
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,046
Punchy, where's your badge?

206
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,799
Okay.

207
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,925
Celia, where's your badge?

208
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,445
Okay.

209
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:47,202
I know what you think.
Even the seal's got the badge.

210
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,565
And just think, because orders is orders...

211
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,403
I can't let my best friend on the train.

212
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,483
All right, I take a chance.
I don't care if I lose my job.

213
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:00,245
I'm going to give you a badge.
I'm going to give you my badge.

214
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,890
But promise you no tell. You swear.

215
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:06,087
They'll never get anything out of me,
unless they use a pump.

216
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,081
Last chance. All aboard.

217
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,967
Aren't you going to wait for Noah?

218
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,688
Right this way.

219
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,920
Just a minute, brother.
Have you got a badge?

220
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,159
Of course. Naturally.

221
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,640
Don't you know no one gets on the train
unless he has a badge?

222
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:22,040
What are you, a wise guy?
That's last year's badge.

223
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,324
Get away!

224
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,124
"Quiet is requested
for the benefit of those who have retired."

225
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,482
Excuse me a minute, Julie.

226
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:06,119
I've got some business to attend to.
I'll be back in a minute.

227
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:11,010
You thought you had him
up against a wall, didn't you?

228
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,240
If he pays you off tonight, you're through.

229
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,525
Yeah? He hasn't paid me off yet.

230
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,563
Professor.

231
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,124
Let's go.

232
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,566
This Loophole, he's a smart lawyer.

233
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:44,562
Maybe he figure a way out
how to fire the strongman.

234
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,561
Then you be the strongman?

235
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,403
That's fine.

236
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,289
Lawyer, you dressed yet?

237
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,679
After a fashion. And a pretty old fashion.

238
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,442
And I wish I had an Old Fashioned.

239
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,282
Told you I'd give you some nice clothes.

240
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:05,204
- Takes a magician to get into this coat.
- That's who I took it from. A magician.

241
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:08,362
Don't split hairs. I'm sick
of the whole thing. I'm going home.

242
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:12,443
This is a big case. This is a big circus.
You're going to get a big fee.

243
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,724
- Fee?
- Sure.

244
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,404
You're not only thoroughly detestable,
but you're cute.

245
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,368
- Then we're friends again?
- After an Old Fashioned.

246
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,008
I'd like you to meet the boss.

247
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,524
Mr. Wilson, mighty glad
to make your acquaintance.

248
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,248
Always wanted to meet you, sir.

249
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,561
Think you're the greatest circus owner
since P. T. Barnum.

250
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,880
Isn't it a pity we never met before?

251
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,961
Loophole, that's not the boss.

252
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,483
- He isn't?
- No.

253
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,447
He should be. He's the executive type.

254
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,762
I'll thank you to keep a civil tongue
in your head, not in mine.

255
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,078
Where is the boss?

256
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:44,559
- Punchy. What're you doing?
- What're you doing there?

257
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,608
Say, either my coat is inhabited,
or I'm inhibited.

258
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,199
There he goes.

259
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,565
Don't worry. He'll come back.
He's a homing pigeon.

260
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,528
Fine. I'll keep a light burning in my pocket.
Where's the boss?

261
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,362
Come on, we find him.

262
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,923
Folks, I want you to meet my pal,
my best friend.

263
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,523
What's your name again?

264
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,009
- Loophole.
- Glad to know you.

265
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:10,048
It's your pleasure.
This meeting brings back memories.

266
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,439
Childhood days, lemonade, romance!

267
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:16,000
My life was wrapped around a circus.
Her name was Lydia.

268
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,526
I met her at the World's Fair in 1900,
marked down from $19.40.

269
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,959
<i>She was the most glorious creature</i>

270
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:29,329
<i>Under the sun</i>

271
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:34,399
<i>Thais! Du Barry! Garbo!</i>

272
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,769
<i>Rolled into one</i>

273
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:46,365
<i>Lydia, Lydia, say, have you met Lydia?</i>

274
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,408
<i>Lydia the tattooed lady</i>

275
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:52,687
<i>She has eyes that folks adore so</i>

276
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:55,489
<i>And a torso even more so</i>

277
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,323
<i>Lydia, Lydia, that encyclopedia</i>

278
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:01,083
<i>Lydia, the queen of tattoo</i>

279
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:04,367
<i>On her back is the Battle of Waterloo</i>

280
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,408
<i>Beside it The Wreck of the Hesperus, too</i>

281
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,209
<i>And proudly above</i>
<i>Waves the red, white, and blue</i>

282
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:13,407
<i>You can learn a lot from Lydia</i>

283
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,720
<i>When her robe is unfurled</i>
<i>She will show you the world</i>

284
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,643
<i>If you step up and tell her where</i>

285
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:28,767
<i>For a dime you can see Kankakee or Paris</i>

286
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,683
<i>Or Washington crossing the Delaware</i>

287
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:41,207
<i>Lydia, Lydia, say, have you met Lydia?</i>

288
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:43,963
<i>Lydia the tattooed lady</i>

289
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,962
<i>When her muscles start relaxing</i>

290
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:49,962
<i>Up the hill comes Andrew Jackson</i>

291
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,689
<i>Lydia, oh, Lydia, that encyclopedia</i>

292
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,409
<i>Lydia, the queen of them all</i>

293
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:58,926
<i>For two bits she will do a mazurka in jazz</i>

294
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,683
<i>With a view of Niagara that nobody has</i>

295
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:04,648
<i>And on a clear day you can see Alcatraz</i>

296
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,449
<i>You can learn a lot from Lydia</i>

297
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:16,448
<i>Come along and see</i>
<i>Buffalo Bill with his lasso</i>

298
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:19,442
<i>Just a little classic by Mendel Picasso</i>

299
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:22,647
<i>Here is Captain Spaulding</i>
<i>Exploring the Amazon</i>

300
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,722
<i>Here's Godiva, but with her pajamas on</i>

301
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,608
<i>Here is Grover Whelan unveiling the Trylon</i>

302
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,727
<i>Over on the West Coast</i>
<i>We have Treasure Island</i>

303
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,882
<i>Here's Nijinsky doing the rumba</i>

304
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:44,042
<i>Here's her Social Security Number</i>

305
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:53,528
<i>Lydia, Lydia, that encyclopedia</i>

306
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:56,443
<i>Lydia, the champ of them all</i>

307
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:59,522
<i>She once swept an Admiral</i>
<i>Clear off his feet</i>

308
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:02,522
<i>The ships on her hips</i>
<i>Made his heart skip a beat</i>

309
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:05,647
<i>And now the old boy's</i>
<i>In command of the fleet</i>

310
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:08,608
<i>For he went and married Lydia</i>

311
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:09,918
<i>I said Lydia</i>

312
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,807
<i>He said Lydia</i>

313
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,118
<i>I said Lydia</i>

314
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,438
<i>We said Lydia</i>

315
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,403
You make a pretty good banker, Gibraltar.

316
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:06,485
- Jeff's in the next car with the gorilla.
- They should be happy together.

317
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,401
Jeff, are you here?

318
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,845
Boss, what's the matter?
What happened here?

319
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:13,649
Here, take the other side.
I'll take this side.

320
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:16,449
Come on. Put him down here on the trunk.

321
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:17,804
That's it.

322
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,165
- Somebody hit him.
- I'm all right.

323
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,203
- Who's this?
- I've got an alibi. I wasn't here.

324
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,724
It's lucky you were hit tonight.
He's a lawyer.

325
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:27,846
- Feeling better, Mr. Wilson?
- It's gone!

326
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,319
- What?
- It's been stolen. My $10,000.

327
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:34,369
$10,000? That man's hurt bad.
Stand back and give him air.

328
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:37,328
- You lose the $10,000?
- He didn't lose it. It was stolen.

329
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,207
I've got to get that money back quick!

330
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,804
Never mind the $10,000. You go to bed.

331
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:44,080
He's right for once.
Come on, let me help you.

332
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,922
I'll take you through here.

333
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:49,605
Go ahead, Jeff. We stay here.
We'll find the money.

334
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:52,199
Punchy. We got to find Jeff's money.

335
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:55,927
Look, we do like detectives.
We re-destruct the crime.

336
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,446
All right, now pay attention.

337
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,521
I'm Jeff. You're the crook.

338
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:04,041
No, it's just acting.
You know what I mean? Acting?

339
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,682
What do you call... Punchy, look out!

340
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,761
Punchy, that's no acting!

341
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,089
You're crazy.

342
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:16,560
We act out the case
like they do in the police station.

343
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:19,329
You've been in the police station?

344
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,885
Fifty cents. See, crime doesn't pay.

345
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:29,238
All right, look, Punchy. I come in.
You follow me.

346
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,201
I don't know you're there.

347
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,401
Now, I take out my money.

348
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,561
I count it. What happens?

349
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,959
Punchy, what's the matter for you?

350
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:43,209
All right, we change it.
This time you're Jeff. I'm the crook.

351
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:47,923
That's right.
This time I'm the crook. Punchy!

352
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,718
I'd better break this case
before you break my head.

353
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:54,769
All right, I solve this case myself.
You stand there. You watch me.

354
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,600
I'm Jeff. I take out my money.

355
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:00,808
I count it. Now, what happens?

356
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,999
You've got nothing
to worry about, Mr. Wilson.

357
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:08,968
With the thief on the train
and the legal eagle on the case...

358
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:11,166
the money is practically in your pocket.

359
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,400
Just keep an eye on your pocket.

360
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:19,087
- No, you don't.
- But I've got to...

361
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:21,121
There's no use talking, Jeff.

362
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:23,360
Money or no money,
you're not going to get up.

363
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,522
You don't understand.
If that thief gets away with that $10,000...

364
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:27,645
I lose everything.

365
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,846
Sorry, there's nothing
you can do about it now.

366
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:32,728
Get some sleep.
In the morning you'll feel a lot better.

367
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:35,529
- Yes, and a lot poorer.
- Does it matter?

368
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:39,079
- Did you get anything?
- Yes. A bump on the head.

369
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,843
- How can you tell?
- You know what I think?

370
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:45,161
The guy who hit Jeff on the head
and knocked him out didn't like him.

371
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,649
Don't let's jump to concussions.

372
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,039
Does anybody here look suspicious,
aside from you?

373
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:52,083
Mr. Carter, the manager.
He's been making trouble.

374
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,445
- Carter?
- But he no steal the money.

375
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:57,442
He's too smart for that.
You know who I think steal the money?

376
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,600
His friend Goliath. He's dumb.

377
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:03,126
The legal eagle is on his track.
If he's guilty, he'll have to prove it.

378
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:03,960
Patois.

379
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,322
You said you was on Goliath's track.

380
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:15,004
This is a detour.
I'll grill her until she's well done.

381
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:18,127
She must know something,
even if it isn't about the case.

382
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,125
She's innocent.
Now then, where's Goliath?

383
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,326
- In the next car.
- Where is he?

384
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:27,201
Here it is, but I ought to tell you...

385
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:29,599
Tell me nothing.
It's my job to get the facts.

386
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:32,158
This fellow will face the shrewd,
relentless grilling...

387
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,162
of the juggernaut of justice,
the Casanova of the courthouse...

388
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,683
the Blackstone of the barroom.

389
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:39,125
Now watch the eagle swoop down.

390
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,165
Who's there?

391
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,162
You'll find out, my fine-feathered felon.
Hors d'oeuvres.

392
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,320
Goliath? I'll get to the bottom of this.

393
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,207
- Well?
- Wrong room.

394
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,848
I'm Goliath. Who are you?

395
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:52,490
Me? Just a little nobody
who wears glasses.

396
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,083
I can hardly see a lick.

397
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:56,684
- Who is this guy?
- That's Mr. Loophole. He's a lawyer.

398
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,328
A lawyer. Isn't that silly?

399
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:02,289
I've been disbarred for years.
I can show you my canceled diploma.

400
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,682
Smart guy, huh?

401
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:07,644
How would you like
I should break you in two?

402
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:10,445
Could I file separate income taxes?

403
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,804
Just what do you want?

404
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,165
Frankly, Mr. Goliath,
when I see a wrong done...

405
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,400
I can't rest until it's righted, that's all.

406
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:20,642
So I brought Tony here to apologize,
that's what.

407
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:24,359
Tony, I want you to tell this lovable chap
that you're sorry.

408
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:25,884
All right, Mr. Goliath.

409
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,087
I'm sorry you knocked out Jeff Wilson
and stole his money.

410
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:43,128
This coat is haunted.

411
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,607
Maybe I'm Captain Flag.

412
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,963
He's as innocent as a newborn babe,
and much bigger.

413
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,610
That settles it.
Now we got to look for a new suspect.

414
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,885
- Yes, and a new lawyer.
- You're not going to quit.

415
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,005
As of now.

416
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:00,843
This guy Goliath, don't be afraid of him.
He's muscle-bound.

417
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,158
And I'm homeward-bound.

418
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,525
How are we going
to get back Jeff's $10,000?

419
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,283
It's very easy. Offer a reward of $15,000.

420
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:19,525
Hello.

421
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:23,685
- Did I frighten you, Mr. Loophole?
- No. Nothing ever frightens me.

422
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,162
I took rumba lessons by mail.

423
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,765
Every time I hear a whistle, I think
it's the postman with another lesson.

424
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:35,160
Jeff's asleep, so I came looking for you.
Has anything developed?

425
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,400
Everything's under control,
except my pulse.

426
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:39,799
Jeff is very grateful for what you're doing.

427
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,403
It's nothing at all.

428
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,640
You know, if you can straighten this out...

429
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:46,369
it would mean a great deal to both of us.

430
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,009
Both of you?

431
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:51,238
I get it. You and Jeff, Jeff and you.

432
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,006
Young love. A maid in distress.

433
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:58,207
Fear not, my lady.
A Loophole never deserts a sinking ship.

434
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,520
- Even if it's a train.
- Thank you.

435
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:03,124
I'll have this case straightened out
before sunrise...

436
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,849
before the rooster crows,
before this flower fades.

437
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,283
Here, my lady.

438
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,322
If we only had a clue.

439
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:15,042
I don't need the lawyer.
All we need is a clue.

440
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,805
What's the matter?
No, I no smoke this brand.

441
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,687
I got to find the clue.

442
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,408
What are you doing?

443
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,243
I know. You smoke the cigar,
you knock yourself out.

444
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,558
But that's no good.

445
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:29,528
I got to find the clue.
Where I find the clue?

446
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:38,369
Gibraltar? You crazy.
Gibraltar no smoke cigars.

447
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:41,203
I got to find the clue. Now, where I find...

448
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:46,362
There's a head
I'd like to have over my fireplace.

449
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:48,884
I got it.

450
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,926
A fractured skull, I trust.

451
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,160
- No. A clue.
- A clue?

452
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,969
Punchy find this cigar
right where Jeff was knocked out.

453
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:59,087
Great. Now, then,
who on this train smokes cigars?

454
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:00,523
Or heavy underwear?

455
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,726
I know. The strongman. Goliath.

456
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:05,529
Nonsense. It wouldn't be him.
His public wouldn't like it.

457
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,760
We got to think of somebody else.

458
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,841
Wait, I got it this time. The midget!

459
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,045
- A midget?
- Yeah.

460
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,325
- A small midget?
- The small midget.

461
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,847
- That's our man.
- You sure?

462
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:19,205
Can you prove that he smoked the cigar?

463
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:22,760
We'll compare smells. If they're alike,
this is the rope that'll hang him.

464
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,283
- Adieu!
- Adieu!

465
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:27,605
Punchy, stay outside.

466
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:30,158
Let Loophole do the talking,
and you keep quiet.

467
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,241
See that you remember that.

468
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,681
All we got for a clue is this cigar butt.

469
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:37,079
So I'll trap him into offering us
one of his cigars.

470
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:39,809
If his cigar matches this one,
he's unquestionably guilty.

471
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:42,165
- That's right.
- We mustn't let on what we're after.

472
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:44,559
- I won't say anything.
- Yes, but don't talk either.

473
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,208
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

474
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,803
What do you want?

475
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,881
Sure, we come in if you insist.

476
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:57,560
- Is this a friend of yours?
- I should say not. He's a lawyer.

477
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:58,879
Yeah?

478
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:01,359
Why? Do you want
to make anything out of it?

479
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:04,203
Try to bully me,
I'll lick you the best day you ever had.

480
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,406
- What brings you here?
- Nothing important.

481
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,958
We just want to trap you
into a confession.

482
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,244
Confession?

483
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:13,003
Nice work, Einstein.
That's what I call using strategy.

484
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,443
I know my stuff, huh?

485
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,805
It's kind of late to be visiting, isn't it?

486
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:19,040
We just happened to be passing
your house...

487
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:21,769
and we saw a firefly
burning in your window.

488
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:23,482
Did you lose this?

489
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:26,638
No, I didn't lose it. Where did you find it?

490
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:29,324
Never mind that.
Are these your teeth prints?

491
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:32,642
- Tony, I guess we're licked.
- I guess so, boss.

492
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:36,120
The man is undoubtedly innocent.
No hard feelings.

493
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:38,405
None at all. Let's shake on it.

494
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,280
By the way, I'm all out of smokes.

495
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,201
Do you happen
to have a spare cigar on you?

496
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,962
Here. I got one.

497
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:50,049
I got one for you, too, and for myself.

498
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:52,679
Thanks. Let me get you a light.

499
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,160
Why don't you trade your head in
on a bowling ball?

500
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,923
Don't you realize
I'm trying to get incriminating evidence?

501
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,204
Let's smoke these up quickly.

502
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:03,441
- Then I'll ask for one of his cigars.
- Here we are, boys.

503
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:10,090
No thanks. Bad luck. Three, I'm a midget.

504
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,842
That's a superstish.

505
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,327
Has anybody got a match?

506
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:22,000
I asked for a match, not a forest fire.

507
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:24,320
What's going on here, anyway?

508
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:30,728
By the way, do you happen to have
a spare cigar on you?

509
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:33,608
I think I got one. Here.

510
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:36,006
You're a big help, you are.

511
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,803
I'll clean up this case if you'll keep quiet.

512
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:43,088
Last time I saw that match,
there was apples growing on it.

513
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:45,081
You got the apples, too.

514
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:50,249
Hitting Jeff on the head
and stealing his money...

515
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,048
that ain't playing ball.

516
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:53,325
I bet your father spent...

517
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,970
the first year of your life
throwing rocks at the stork.

518
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:59,167
I know how to get rid of you.
Smoke one of your own cigars.

519
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,808
I don't think I got any more.

520
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:03,768
Good. What a break.
Now I'll make him confess.

521
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,202
By the way...

522
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,247
do you happen to have
a spare cigar on you?

523
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:12,242
Wait a minute. I find one.

524
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,798
It's the last one I got, but you can have it.

525
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:18,563
I couldn't think of taking your last cigar.

526
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,567
Go ahead, it's all right.

527
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:24,679
I've carried many a torch,
but never on such a large scale.

528
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,690
Do you realize
if Jeff had been hit a little harder...

529
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:30,489
the charge would have been murder.
Pronounced murder?

530
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,129
Yes, murder.

531
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:37,123
How would you like to go to Sing Sing
and get the high chair?

532
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:39,485
You better not lay a hand on me.
You ain't the law.

533
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:42,130
You're right.
We haven't got anything on you.

534
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,924
Anyone can make a mistake.
No hard feelings.

535
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:47,240
- No, not at all.
- Let's shake on it.

536
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,688
Let's smoke on it.

537
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:54,399
Heck, I seem to be all out of cigars.

538
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:57,843
You don't happen to have a spare cheroot
on you, do you?

539
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:00,842
I find one more. Are you lucky.

540
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:03,440
I thought this cigar was in my other suit.

541
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:06,283
I wish you were in your other suit
and it was being pressed.

542
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:10,079
- No, mangled.
- I just remember. This is my other suit.

543
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:13,921
You know, these cigars are imported.
They're hard to get.

544
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:18,640
I haven't had any trouble getting them,
not with that plantation under your vest.

545
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:21,198
Boss, you're not getting any evidence.

546
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:23,008
No, but I'm getting tobacco heart.

547
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:26,799
You better tell the truth,
half the truth, and nothing but the truth.

548
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:34,201
I told you to eat corn flakes for breakfast,
not the goldenrod.

549
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:36,281
Are you guys trying to wreck my house?

550
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,565
Wait till the finance company
sees this furniture.

551
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,719
Are you gonna get it.

552
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:42,529
You fellows got no right coming here,
raising such a rumpus.

553
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:44,202
I don't raise no rumpus.

554
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:45,564
I'm gonna sue you.

555
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:49,245
If you need a good lawyer,
I'm your man. Cheever Loophole.

556
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:50,804
Hold it.

557
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:59,445
It's all right.

558
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,038
I stand in the rain, and he sneezes.

559
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,162
They can't be mine.

560
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:55,208
That's definite. They're not mine.

561
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:57,963
- Go away.
- What? Go out from under your life?

562
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,278
Get away.

563
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,247
Playing piggyback. At my age.

564
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:03,924
You're the prettiest millstone
I ever had around my neck.

565
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:04,999
You fool.

566
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,524
We'll be very happy together,
if my back holds out.

567
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:08,599
Put me down.

568
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,840
Mr. Loophole, have you met
Peerless Pauline?

569
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,363
No. How do you do?

570
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:14,884
- Put me down, you fool.
- Reluctantly.

571
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:16,724
All right, let her go.

572
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:18,880
Careful, you're talking
of the woman I love.

573
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,165
Carter loves her, too. She's his girl.

574
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,888
I just thought of something.

575
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:25,404
Maybe Carter knows something
about the stolen money...

576
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:28,129
and if Pauline's his girl,
maybe she knows something, too.

577
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:31,008
If she doesn't, it'll be fun teaching her.

578
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:33,243
Legal eagle.

579
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,963
Here it is, babe. The whole $10,000.

580
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:45,204
Why don't you quit that
while I'm talking to you?

581
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:48,760
I got to break in these new shoes.
I nearly fell today.

582
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,886
Break them in some other time.

583
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:52,449
Take care of this money.

584
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:56,045
I think that lawyer suspects me,
and I don't want to have it on me.

585
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,724
There he is. I bet he's up to something.

586
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:05,040
Go on, get out of here. I'll handle him.

587
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:07,360
Be careful,
and find out if he knows anything.

588
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:10,601
It's me, or it's I. At any rate, it's one of us.

589
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,442
- Come in.
- Pauline.

590
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:14,323
Are you home?

591
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,484
What do you want?

592
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:17,798
If this is a spirit reading...

593
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:20,006
I'd like something good in the fourth
at Belmont.

594
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,081
- Hello, brown eyes.
- Hello, brown...

595
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:25,684
Say, you're up early today, aren't you?

596
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:30,365
You're like a beautiful chandelier.
I'd like to be around when you get lit up.

597
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,724
What brings you here?

598
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,961
Lots of reasons. 10,000 reasons.

599
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,483
What are you doing?

600
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:39,721
Don't mind me.
I'm just a talent scout for Alcatraz.

601
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,525
Let me phrase it more delicately.

602
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:51,319
Where were you when Jeff got bopped
on the conk and clipped for his roll, babe?

603
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,640
Why, Mr. Loophole,
surely you don't think that l...

604
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:55,129
Egad, no.

605
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:59,362
Anyone who looks at you
can see that you're not hiding anything.

606
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:02,042
You're a lawyer, aren't you?

607
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:05,841
- They tell me you're a great lawyer.
- Who does? Not my clients.

608
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:08,928
Certainly not the ones
that were hung last week.

609
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:12,965
- Have you solved your case?
- What case?

610
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,359
Whatever case you're working on.

611
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:18,999
Let's not sit here and talk about little me.
Let's talk about little you.

612
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,240
Have you deposited $10,000
in the bank lately?

613
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:22,729
Whatever made you say that?

614
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:26,644
You know what the French say:
<i>Cherchez la femme.</i> Find the footprints.

615
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,247
- Peanut brittle?
- No, thanks.

616
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:36,368
- There's no point in my staying here.
- Don't go, please.

617
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,645
Perhaps you'll think I'm forward...

618
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:41,000
but last night when I first saw you...

619
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:42,603
And slammed the door on my face.

620
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:45,488
...I realized that you're the man
I've been dreaming of.

621
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:47,448
What do you eat before you go to bed?

622
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:49,964
I've waited so long
to find someone like you.

623
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:52,359
Someone like me?
I'm not good enough for you?

624
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:54,645
Don't say that. I'm not good enough.

625
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:57,369
You ought to know. But I really have to go.

626
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:59,327
Don't go. No, please.

627
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:01,207
- I can't stay.
- No, stay.

628
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:03,963
- I'd love to stay, but...
- Yes, please. Really.

629
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:06,962
Your father wasn't by any chance
an octopus, was he?

630
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,729
No, I really have to go.

631
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:11,278
- Don't go, please.
- I'll be right back.

632
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,038
I'm back.

633
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:22,240
So sorry you have to go.

634
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:25,083
The thing I like about you
is money doesn't go to your head.

635
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:27,047
I hope you solve the case
you're working on.

636
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:29,325
It's out of my hands.
It's been a private investigation...

637
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,321
but right now I could use
the long arm of the law.

638
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:33,519
Law?

639
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:36,919
But you don't have to go right now,
do you?

640
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:40,286
There's nothing to keep me here
that I can see from this angle.

641
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:42,884
But we hardly know each other.

642
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:45,923
I can be very entertaining if I want to be.

643
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:49,446
There must be some way
of getting the money...

644
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,839
without getting in trouble
with the Hays Office.

645
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:54,080
Will you walk on your hands?

646
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:55,683
Silly boy, of course not.

647
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:59,365
All right, forget about it.
Will you walk on the ceiling?

648
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:02,170
And when I'm on the ceiling,
you'll run out and call...

649
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,285
You'll run away.

650
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:06,726
That's the farthest thought from my mind,
so help me the law of gravity.

651
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:09,244
All right, I'll walk on the ceiling
if you will, too.

652
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:12,288
No, thanks. I'll sit this one out.

653
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:17,284
I'm just an old groundhog.
I shouldn't even be out until February.

654
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:18,843
But it's so easy.

655
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:22,400
The bottom of the shoe creates a suction
that holds you up on the ceiling.

656
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:25,880
No, I'd rather not.
I have an agreement with the houseflies.

657
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:29,042
The flies don't practice law,
and I don't walk on the ceiling.

658
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:30,643
You'll love it.

659
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:34,558
Come on, Cheever.

660
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:38,199
Are you sure we're not being too hasty?
After all, I am just a boy.

661
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:42,488
- You're a trouper, an aerial star.
- You could be, too.

662
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:44,680
You're tall, you're strong.

663
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:46,562
You're nearsighted.

664
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:48,523
Hurry, Cheever.

665
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:51,443
You're not fooling, now?
You will walk on the ceiling?

666
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:53,043
Only with you.

667
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:55,920
Don't look, now. No peeky-weeky.

668
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:01,050
I'll bet you're laughing at me inside.

669
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:07,324
And to think I might have roamed
the whole world over and never found you.

670
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:09,804
Ready, darling?

671
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:12,404
I know I'm going to hate myself for this
in the morning.

672
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:15,960
- Why, you look like a million.
- I'll settle for $10,000.

673
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:19,405
- Suppose you go first.
- Why?

674
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:22,370
In case you fall, I'll be here to pick it up.

675
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:24,521
No. Let's go up together.

676
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:27,488
If that's your best offer,
but I'm not making a nickel on it.

677
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:29,686
Once you do this you'll never forget it.

678
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:32,409
The last time I stood on a ceiling
was at a lodge meeting.

679
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:34,242
The chairman had the floor.

680
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:36,122
How am I doing here?

681
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:37,882
Careful, Cheever.

682
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:45,569
You don't want to reach over
and hold this thing?

683
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:52,644
Come on. Lift your body
and clamp your foot on the ceiling.

684
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:03,518
A very good morning to you, Mrs. Murphy.

685
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:07,366
- Help.
- There. I knew you'd like it.

686
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,239
Say, I like this.

687
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:13,242
I never thought
we'd be hanging around together.

688
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:17,521
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate this. Shake.

689
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:19,405
I see.

690
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:28,521
Pauline, let's never lose
this thrilling moment.

691
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:31,410
Think of it.
You and I, heels over head in love.

692
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:33,082
- Do you rumba?
- No.

693
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:34,439
Come on. Let's dance.

694
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:36,686
Pennies from heaven.

695
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:39,486
Pauline, help me down.

696
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:41,242
Pauline, let me have that wallet.

697
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:44,687
Pauline, I'm stuck up... Let me down.

698
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:48,922
Pauline, how do I get down out of here?
Pauline, quick. Help.

699
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,480
Get me down, Pauline.

700
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:55,003
Help me down.

701
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:57,207
Get me off the ceiling.

702
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:59,441
Help. I'm stuck up...

703
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:03,005
- Julie?
- Come in.

704
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:08,083
- Hi there, Mr. Wilson.
- Telegram for you.

705
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:10,088
Thanks. Excuse me.

706
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:18,082
It's nothing important.

707
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:20,604
Julie, why don't you take that job?

708
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:23,481
What job?

709
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:26,721
With the Miracle Shows.
I heard they made you an offer.

710
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:28,801
That. I'm turning that down.

711
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:30,563
Maybe you better take it.

712
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:34,165
It looks as if the Wilson Wonder Circus
is gonna have to do without Wilson.

713
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:37,367
I might not be the best boss in the world...

714
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:39,924
but I don't think you'll like working
for Carter.

715
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:43,639
I don't intend to work for Carter.
I'm leaving when you leave.

716
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:45,841
But where will you go to?

717
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:47,318
Where you go.

718
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:50,808
- Don't you want me to, Jeff?
- Sure.

719
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:57,241
This isn't easy for me.

720
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:04,362
I've made plenty of mistakes, I guess.
But I don't want to make another.

721
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:07,124
You once said that we belong
to different worlds.

722
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:09,605
You're right. You're a success.

723
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:13,327
When I leave here I won't even have a job.

724
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:16,563
Things will work out for you.
I know they will.

725
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:18,959
Until they do, until I can pay the bills...

726
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,644
I'm not going to drag you to any preacher.

727
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:24,324
You're pretty heavy...

728
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:26,442
but suppose I drag you?

729
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:32,202
I don't think I'd enjoy life
as Mr. Julie Randall.

730
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:35,839
You better wire Miracle Shows
you're going to take that job.

731
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:38,846
I guess Emily Post was right.

732
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:44,078
A girl should never propose to a man.

733
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:51,407
You're some lawyer. You come here
to help Jeff and Julie, and what happened?

734
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:54,562
Come, come, you know as well as I do.
And you know better.

735
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:56,880
- We've got to think.
- We tried that.

736
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:58,608
Let's review the case.

737
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:01,045
One Jeff Wilson owes $10,000.

738
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:05,123
Or let's put it another way:
$10,000 is owed by one Jeff Wilson.

739
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:07,963
It's a clear case
of Jeff Wilson owing $10,000.

740
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:10,763
- Which he ain't got.
- Brilliant deduction.

741
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:21,006
If only that Mrs. Dukesbury
would help him out.

742
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:23,160
- Mrs. Dukesbury?
- Yeah. She's Jeff's aunt.

743
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:26,003
The rich Mrs. Dukesbury?
Page 1 of the social register?

744
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:28,240
The Newport branch
of the United States Mint?

745
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:29,843
That money is Jeff's aunt?

746
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:33,002
I usually say aunt, but I'm showing off
on account of the monkeys.

747
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,001
But she wouldn't lend Jeff the money.

748
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,603
Wait, I got an idea.

749
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:39,124
You go to Newport
and ask Mr. Dukesbury for the money.

750
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:40,245
Fine.

751
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,924
I mean, if he's alive you could ask him.
But he's dead.

752
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:45,524
He's dead, eh?
Then why don't you ask him?

753
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:49,528
Mrs. Dukesbury,
America's wealthiest widow...

754
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:52,881
and yours truly, who could certainly
use the money for Jeff.

755
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:55,564
Don't tell this to Jeff,
but his troubles are over.

756
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,322
Goodbye, Mr. Chimps.

757
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:02,568
Let him go. We solve this case myself.

758
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:05,039
Punchy, I'm going to my tent
where I can think.

759
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:07,485
You come over later and wake me up.

760
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:57,767
Well, shut my mouth and freeze my face.

761
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:00,318
That man don't belong to no human race.

762
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,970
Got a hoca-hoca-pocus
and a fiddle-dee-dee...

763
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:05,518
that can charm a lion or a chimpanzee.

764
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:13,759
Well, button my lip and send me quick.

765
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:15,806
That man's got a voodoo in that stick.

766
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:18,848
When he voodoo raki-sakis
he can hypnotize an elf.

767
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:21,603
That man must be Swingali himself.

768
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:36,528
<i>Zoom zoom go the cymbals</i>

769
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:38,248
<i>And boom boom go the drums</i>

770
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:42,243
<i>There's dancing feet all over the street</i>
<i>When that man comes</i>

771
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:44,207
<i>The kids from the alley</i>

772
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:46,440
<i>They rally round Swingali</i>

773
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:49,203
<i>He waves that Toscaninian hand</i>

774
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:51,724
<i>And zoom zoom go the cymbals</i>

775
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:53,880
<i>And soon Swingali sways</i>

776
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:55,801
<i>The basses thump</i>
<i>to thousands of trumpets</i>

777
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:57,801
<i>Sounding their A 's</i>

778
00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:01,485
<i>Mr. Swingali</i>
<i>Tell me, is he man or maestro?</i>

779
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:04,209
<i>Zoom zoom goes your heart</i>
<i>When he's in command</i>

780
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:05,882
<i>Give that man a hand</i>

781
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:07,085
<i>Yeah, man</i>

782
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:11,402
<i>When he gives the downbeat</i>
<i>They swing us soft and low</i>

783
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:21,884
<i>Play something for me</i>
<i>Play it loud and corny</i>

784
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:42,403
<i>Oh, glory hallelujah!</i>

785
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:44,606
<i>Rhythm races through ya</i>

786
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,601
<i>When he rolls his evil eye</i>

787
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:48,282
<i>He can boogie-boo ya</i>

788
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:18,081
<i>Louder now, yeah, louder now, yeah</i>
<i>Louder now, yeah</i>

789
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:23,285
<i>Why be melancholy</i>
<i>When we got Swingali?</i>

790
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:33,801
<i>Hey, look me in the eye</i>

791
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:36,009
<i>Concentrate</i>

792
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:38,123
<i>Relax</i>

793
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:39,844
<i>Swing it</i>

794
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:43,329
<i>Make it rise up to the skies</i>
<i>And hypnotize the moon</i>

795
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:50,286
<i>Make it a blue</i>

796
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:52,970
<i>Moon</i>

797
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:57,009
<i>Make it a blue</i>

798
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:02,881
<i>Moon</i>

799
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:33,687
<i>Swing low, sweet chariot</i>

800
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:58,365
Hello, Teresa.
This is Suzanna, Suzanna Dukesbury.

801
00:53:58,810 --> 00:54:01,244
You are coming tomorrow night,
aren't you?

802
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:04,720
Splendid. Yes. Just as the invitation read.

803
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:07,563
I'm bringing Jardinet
and his famous symphony orchestra...

804
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:10,039
all the way from Paris, just to play for us.

805
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:12,849
And I've invited only the 400 of Newport.

806
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:14,529
No outsiders.

807
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:23,123
Here, what is this?

808
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:25,047
It's English tweed. Wears like iron.

809
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:27,690
Now, then,
where's old Lady Dukesbury's room?

810
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:28,759
I beg your pardon.

811
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:30,806
Mrs. Dukesbury cannot be disturbed
by anyone.

812
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:32,448
I don't want to be disturbed either.

813
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:35,363
- You can't go up there. Who are you?
- Who am I? Mr. Dukesbury.

814
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:38,487
But I understood
Mr. Dukesbury passed away.

815
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:41,482
Just a typographical error.
Passed out. What a brawl that was.

816
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:43,686
Here I am, after the brawl is over.

817
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:47,285
- I'll inform Mrs. Dukesbury you're here.
- Never mind. I'll tell her myself.

818
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:49,520
What's her room number?
Never mind. I'll find it.

819
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:53,205
I've been in bigger hotels than this,
and with better-looking clerks.

820
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:58,288
What in the world...

821
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:01,129
What is the meaning of this?

822
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:03,485
Keep your sheet on.
I'm looking for Mrs. Dukesbury.

823
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:05,003
I am Mrs. Dukesbury.

824
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:07,001
Snookums!

825
00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:09,126
Gracious. I don't know you.

826
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:10,962
You mean you've forgotten?

827
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:14,606
I know. You have forgotten.
Those June nights on the Riviera...

828
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:16,681
when we sat
underneath the shimmering skies...

829
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:20,365
moonlight-bathing in the Mediterranean.
We were young, gay, reckless.

830
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:22,521
The night I drank champagne
from your slipper.

831
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:25,841
Two quarts. It would have held more,
but you were wearing innersoles.

832
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:28,683
- Hildegard.
- My name is Suzanna.

833
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:29,839
Let's not quibble.

834
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:32,842
It's enough that you've killed something
fine and beautiful.

835
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:36,843
<i>Suzanna. Won't you fly with me?</i>

836
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:40,002
<i>For I need $10,000</i>
<i>'cause the Sheriff's after me</i>

837
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,843
Get out of this room
or I'll scream for the servants!

838
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:46,445
Let the servants know.
Let the whole world know about us.

839
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:48,283
You must leave my room.

840
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:50,600
We must have regard
for certain conventions.

841
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:53,045
One guy isn't enough.
She's got to have a convention.

842
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:56,327
Suzanna, at last we're alone.

843
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:59,368
Couldn't the two of us be...
How shall I say it?

844
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:02,409
A man and a woman? There. I said it.

845
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:06,247
Suzanna, if you only knew
how much I need you.

846
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:08,798
Not because you have millions.
I don't need millions.

847
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:10,403
I'll tell you how much I need.

848
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:13,607
Have you got a pencil?
I left my typewriter in my other pants.

849
00:56:14,090 --> 00:56:16,650
- That's Whitcomb. What will I do?
- I'll cool him off.

850
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:20,325
No, you mustn't.
This is so embarrassing. Oh, dear.

851
00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:24,847
What, succotash? What's eating you?

852
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:28,127
I beg your pardon, but M. La Fontaine
of the concert bureau...

853
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:30,565
has phoned to say
that all arrangements are complete.

854
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:32,880
- The maestro will be here on time.
- That's fine.

855
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:35,564
Here's a dime. Get yourself a clean shirt.

856
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:38,323
- He's gonna get himself a clean shirt.
- This is an outrage.

857
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:40,526
I'll say it is. That Whitcomb is a fine butler.

858
00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:43,204
I phoned five hours ago
and he gives you the message now.

859
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:44,928
Why, you're not M. La Fontaine?

860
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:46,762
What do you mean,
I'm not M. La Fontaine?

861
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:49,489
Do I go around saying
you're not M. La Fontaine?

862
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:51,880
It must be wonderful to be associated...

863
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:55,440
- with such a great artist as Jardinet.
- It is a pushover.

864
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:57,566
- Did you say Jardinet?
- Why, of course.

865
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:00,210
Be sure when the <i>Normandie</i>
docks tomorrow in New York...

866
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:03,043
Jardinet and his entire orchestra
come directly here.

867
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:05,081
This bedroom will be awfully crowded.

868
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:08,242
Say, Suzie, hiring a world-famous guy
like what's-his-name...

869
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:09,843
that will run into money.

870
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:13,081
I realize that. I didn't expect him
to play at my party for nothing.

871
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:15,286
You'll get your check tomorrow night
as agreed.

872
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:18,646
Tell me, suppose through
some strange quirk of fate...

873
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:20,368
that Jardinet couldn't get here?

874
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:23,123
Would you be interested
in any other form of entertainment?

875
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:26,088
Say some novel surprises
wrapped in sawdust?

876
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:29,088
Why, it's unthinkable.
Jardinet must get here.

877
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:33,721
After all, $7,500 for one night's
entertainment is a lot of money.

878
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:38,241
$7,500 is a pretty penny,
but my client needs $10,000...

879
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:41,163
for reasons that should be
pretty obvious by now.

880
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:45,880
I hate to bring up money matters
in a bedroom, but...

881
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:47,323
But what?

882
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:49,765
Just write me out a check for $10,000...

883
00:57:49,850 --> 00:57:52,159
and everybody will be happy,
including the gorilla...

884
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:53,524
and I do mean you.

885
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:55,840
But we agreed on $7,500.

886
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:58,560
But you do not know
about the rate of exchange.

887
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:00,322
You see, in <i>la belle France...</i>

888
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:04,198
$7,500 is over 150,000 francs...

889
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:07,567
while in this country, $7,500...

890
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:10,842
is, well, $7,500.

891
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:12,842
That is fluctuation.

892
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:15,884
Very well.
Anything to make the party a success.

893
00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:19,406
This will be the most successful
surprise party you have ever given.

894
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:21,560
But it's not a surprise party.

895
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:23,242
What will you bet?

896
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:36,403
By this time tomorrow,
you'll be in Chicago.

897
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:38,609
Then what?

898
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:41,920
It's really a swell break for you, Julie.

899
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:44,240
The Miracle Shows have a fine outfit.

900
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:47,361
They're gonna be crazy about you.

901
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:51,201
What are you gonna do, Jeff?

902
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:53,361
I'll have plenty to do.

903
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:56,200
Six days a week I'll think about you.

904
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:58,645
On Sunday I'll look for a job.

905
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:01,325
Fine chance you'll have of finding a job
on Sunday.

906
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:02,968
That's just the point.

907
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:06,565
No job on Sunday, so I'll have
six more days to think about you.

908
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:10,563
When Sunday comes around,
no job, I'll have six more days.

909
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:23,766
<i>Do we know what we're doing?</i>

910
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:26,319
<i>Two blind loves</i>

911
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:29,761
<i>Don't know what month it is</i>

912
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:32,803
<i>Or the time of day</i>

913
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:36,167
<i>Don't know if we're in Brooklyn</i>

914
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:39,362
<i>Or in Mandalay</i>

915
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:41,600
<i>I only know</i>

916
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:45,285
<i>The sun started to shine</i>

917
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:49,405
<i>The day that I looked into your eyes</i>

918
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:52,641
<i>And you looked into mine</i>

919
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:56,968
<i>Two blind loves</i>

920
00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:59,849
<i>Babes in the wood</i>

921
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:03,407
<i>We've got it, oh, so bad</i>

922
01:00:03,490 --> 01:00:06,050
<i>But isn't it good?</i>

923
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:09,680
<i>We're on a bumpy road, it's true</i>

924
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:13,604
<i>But heaven is in view</i>

925
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:19,400
<i>For two blind loves</i>

926
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,728
Are you sleeping?

927
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:46,159
With all this trouble,
with Jeff losing the circus tomorrow...

928
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:48,081
how can you fall asleep?

929
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:54,563
You count sheep?

930
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:59,279
How many sheep do you have to count
before you fall asleep?

931
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:02,806
One? You're an insomaniac.

932
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:06,245
You know,
we look every place for the money...

933
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:09,845
but there's one place we don't look.
That's Goliath's room.

934
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:14,208
Wait. You run away, too, like the lawyer?
You're a coward.

935
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:18,044
No, you're not a regular coward.

936
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:21,047
You're a brave coward.

937
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:25,720
Tell me, how does Goliath sleep?

938
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:28,643
With his eyes closed? That's news.

939
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:31,879
What I mean is, does he sleep good?

940
01:01:35,610 --> 01:01:38,249
Like a top. I gets wise.

941
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:41,163
That's fine. Now, we got work to do.

942
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:43,321
Get your clothes. Come on.

943
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:47,883
This is Goliath's room. Keep quiet.

944
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:01,881
He's asleep like a baby.

945
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:21,242
Now we got to look for the money.
It's better we work in the dark.

946
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:29,366
We got to work fast.
I look over there. You look over there.

947
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:32,249
If anything happens, we meet right here.

948
01:02:33,770 --> 01:02:35,840
That's fine. Go ahead.

949
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:48,363
Quick, hide.

950
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:39,005
We got to find the money in a hurry.
Maybe he's sleeping on it.

951
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:05,209
All right. I look in the pillow.
You look under the blanket. Go on.

952
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:39,964
You no find it? It's not in here either.

953
01:04:59,290 --> 01:05:02,202
Santa Claus,
it looks like a white Christmas.

954
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:14,207
If he wakes up, I pity us.

955
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:17,088
Here, hold that. Hold it. I got an idea.

956
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:21,569
This will make Goliath sleep.

957
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:41,208
What you do? Wake up.

958
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:44,479
Wake up, Punchy.

959
01:05:51,450 --> 01:05:52,883
Punchy, wake up.

960
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:09,006
See? I sing a lullaby, and you wake up.
That's fine.

961
01:06:09,650 --> 01:06:11,959
Maybe the money's in the mattress.

962
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:27,927
Punchy, what are you doing?

963
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:30,002
Punchy, get down.

964
01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:18,642
- Porter.
- Yes?

965
01:07:19,490 --> 01:07:20,923
Help!

966
01:07:24,410 --> 01:07:25,445
Come on.

967
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:30,449
Let's get out of here. Come on, Punchy.

968
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:34,121
Yeah. So long.

969
01:07:40,610 --> 01:07:43,044
Is there a Jeff Wilson on the train?

970
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:44,843
I'm Jeff Wilson. Why?

971
01:07:44,930 --> 01:07:48,479
Long-distance been trying to get you
all along the line.

972
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:50,288
- Long-distance?
- Yeah.

973
01:07:55,210 --> 01:07:58,759
You can use this telephone, young man.
Ask for the Newport operator.

974
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:04,809
Hello, Jeffrey. This is the legal eagle.

975
01:08:06,090 --> 01:08:08,240
I'm calling from Dukesbury Manor.

976
01:08:08,330 --> 01:08:11,242
Never mind what I'm doing here.
I've got a great scheme.

977
01:08:11,330 --> 01:08:12,365
Listen.

978
01:08:16,090 --> 01:08:17,648
- How much?
- $10,000.

979
01:08:17,730 --> 01:08:20,039
She thinks she's getting Jardinet
and his orchestra.

980
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:23,281
But I have a sneaking suspicion
Jardinet's not going to show up.

981
01:08:23,530 --> 01:08:25,964
- lf we can only get away with it.
- Certainly.

982
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:28,559
You play the circus
right on your aunt's front lawn.

983
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:30,880
Be very quiet
while you're setting the tents up.

984
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:32,887
And keep the elephants
out of the flowerbed.

985
01:08:32,970 --> 01:08:34,289
You take care of that end...

986
01:08:34,370 --> 01:08:38,079
I'll get the circus there by tomorrow night
if it's the last thing I do.

987
01:08:38,450 --> 01:08:39,724
Oh, boy.

988
01:08:40,810 --> 01:08:42,038
Operator.

989
01:08:43,690 --> 01:08:47,285
Get me the steamship <i>Normandie.</i>
Where is it? It's in the water.

990
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:50,802
Why, I can't believe it.

991
01:08:51,130 --> 01:08:53,246
But I tell you,
the man's name is not Jardinet.

992
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:55,161
His real name is D.T. O'Connor.

993
01:08:55,650 --> 01:08:57,527
There must be some mistake.

994
01:08:57,730 --> 01:08:59,163
Are you sure?

995
01:08:59,290 --> 01:09:02,441
It's the biggest dope ring in years,
and Jardinet is the head dope.

996
01:09:02,530 --> 01:09:04,998
Keep him in the brig
until I can dig up some more dope.

997
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:08,048
This is operator 77 B signing off.
That is all.

998
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:27,081
It's always those three top buttons.

999
01:09:27,170 --> 01:09:30,401
I'll make it. I used to be a riveter
on the Golden Gate Bridge.

1000
01:09:32,050 --> 01:09:34,405
- There you are.
- Thank you.

1001
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:38,165
Now then, tell me,
how do you like the bandstand?

1002
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:42,002
I had it built especially for Jardinet.
Will he like it?

1003
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:43,762
If he ever sees it.

1004
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:45,889
Yes, Whitcomb.

1005
01:09:46,290 --> 01:09:47,359
Pardon me, madam...

1006
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:50,567
but here are the seating arrangements
for your final approval.

1007
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:54,365
No, Whitcomb.
Judge Chanock will sit on my left hand...

1008
01:09:54,850 --> 01:09:57,648
and you will sit on my right hand.

1009
01:09:57,810 --> 01:09:59,562
How will you eat? Through a tube?

1010
01:09:59,650 --> 01:10:04,246
376, 377, 378, 379, 380, 381...

1011
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:09,199
382, 383, 384, 385, 386, 387...

1012
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:12,168
388, 389, 390...

1013
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:14,804
91, 92, 93, 94, 95...

1014
01:10:14,890 --> 01:10:16,482
96, 97...

1015
01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:19,084
398, 399, 400.

1016
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:22,608
They all showed up.
Looks like no second helpings.

1017
01:10:25,450 --> 01:10:26,803
Ladies and gentlemen...

1018
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:29,927
on behalf of our gracious, charming,
and lovely hostess...

1019
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:31,045
I say to you:

1020
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:33,325
Good evening, friends.

1021
01:10:34,090 --> 01:10:38,163
- And now, let's lap up the vittles.
<i>- Monsieur,</i> control yourself.

1022
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:43,923
Find Mr. Loophole.
Tell him we'll be ready in five minutes.

1023
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:45,807
Sure, Jeff. Five minutes.

1024
01:10:46,050 --> 01:10:48,689
- M. La Fontaine?
- What is it, my little smorgasbord?

1025
01:10:48,770 --> 01:10:50,965
It's 5 minutes of 10:00,
and they're not here yet.

1026
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:53,245
It takes time.
You know how elephants are.

1027
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:55,924
- Elephants?
- Who said anything about elephants?

1028
01:10:56,010 --> 01:10:58,968
Give me that.
You've had quite enough of this.

1029
01:10:59,330 --> 01:11:01,161
Elephants. At your age.

1030
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:05,964
And since Mrs. Dukesbury
and her checkbook...

1031
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:08,848
are entirely responsible
for this magnificent shindig...

1032
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:11,285
I suggest we give the kid a great big hand.

1033
01:11:15,970 --> 01:11:19,724
I'm sure Marie Antoinette
would like to say a few boring words.

1034
01:11:23,770 --> 01:11:25,647
Can I quote you on that?

1035
01:11:26,570 --> 01:11:28,606
Relax. Your entertainment
is practically ready.

1036
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:30,601
Go on. Get in there and fight.

1037
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:38,366
- Oh, dear.
- You should cut out starches.

1038
01:11:40,970 --> 01:11:42,323
Please hurry.

1039
01:11:47,610 --> 01:11:49,760
Say, have you got a slow leak?

1040
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:53,320
Now, if no one cares for more coffee,
we'll all be going.

1041
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:56,966
I'll have another cup of coffee.

1042
01:11:58,130 --> 01:12:00,769
Don't leave me, Suzanna.
Can't you see that I love you?

1043
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:04,399
There. You dragged it out of me.
I love you, all of you.

1044
01:12:04,490 --> 01:12:07,607
I love you feverishly.
Have you got a thermometer on you?

1045
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:13,201
Not here, <i>monsieur.</i>

1046
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:16,444
I can't help it. It's just the animal in me.

1047
01:12:22,730 --> 01:12:26,279
Do you get it? I don't care what you do,
as long as the show don't go on.

1048
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:28,088
Now get going. Come on.

1049
01:12:33,050 --> 01:12:36,884
- So Carter has friends. You better beat it.
- Says you.

1050
01:12:49,210 --> 01:12:51,121
Thanks, Punchy. Just in time.

1051
01:12:51,810 --> 01:12:53,482
Stop that.

1052
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:54,844
Help! Police!

1053
01:13:05,570 --> 01:13:07,367
Get him, Punchy. Attaboy.

1054
01:13:14,650 --> 01:13:17,528
I bet Carter's behind this.
Let's find him. Go on.

1055
01:13:41,170 --> 01:13:43,126
So it's you.

1056
01:13:44,890 --> 01:13:46,323
I'll fix you.

1057
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:55,848
Haven't you had enough coffee?
My guests are waiting.

1058
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:58,086
Yes, I think I've had enough.

1059
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:02,479
Very well, then. We'll all be going.

1060
01:14:03,010 --> 01:14:06,286
I think I'll have another cup of coffee.
It's awfully good, isn't it?

1061
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:10,485
Don't worry.
The entertainment is right on tap.

1062
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:12,879
Are you sure? Where is Jardinet?

1063
01:14:13,410 --> 01:14:15,526
I knew there was something
I wanted to tell you.

1064
01:14:15,610 --> 01:14:16,838
- He isn't coming.
- What?

1065
01:14:19,010 --> 01:14:20,682
I am Jardinet.

1066
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:31,520
I cross the ocean. I am called a dope ring.

1067
01:14:31,810 --> 01:14:35,200
I race on a train.
When I get here, what do I find?

1068
01:14:35,570 --> 01:14:36,605
Animals.

1069
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:42,082
Mrs. Dukesbury's friends are my friends.
I'll take care of him.

1070
01:14:42,170 --> 01:14:45,367
- M. La Fontaine, please be careful.
- Animals, indeed.

1071
01:14:45,570 --> 01:14:48,164
This is the most incredible thing
that has ever happened.

1072
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:51,401
You're all upset. Why don't you
go back to Paris and lie down?

1073
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:54,243
Jardinet's symphony
never has been so humiliated.

1074
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:56,048
I have a notion not to play.

1075
01:14:56,130 --> 01:14:59,202
That's an excellent notion.
Come on. I'll put you on the bus.

1076
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:04,005
But I have given my word. I will play.
Yes, I will play.

1077
01:15:04,090 --> 01:15:06,843
You'll play, but on the bandstand,
down on the water.

1078
01:15:06,930 --> 01:15:08,602
On the water? But my audience.

1079
01:15:08,690 --> 01:15:11,841
Don't worry. You start playing,
they'll come down in spite of it.

1080
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:15,563
- Mrs. Dukesbury's idea.
- Crazy Americans.

1081
01:15:15,650 --> 01:15:16,685
We're ready, boss.

1082
01:15:16,770 --> 01:15:18,886
Take this bearded symphony
to the bandstand...

1083
01:15:18,970 --> 01:15:22,087
- and see that he gets a good sendoff.
- Okay, boss.

1084
01:15:26,290 --> 01:15:30,329
I know you'll all be thrilled.
Jardinet's opening number...

1085
01:15:30,410 --> 01:15:33,686
will be Beethoven's somber
and spiritual first movement...

1086
01:15:33,770 --> 01:15:37,365
of his second concerto,
album three, opus four...

1087
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:39,805
And number five on the hit parade.

1088
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:41,922
Oh, goodness.

1089
01:15:48,930 --> 01:15:50,079
Open it.

1090
01:15:58,010 --> 01:16:00,570
She's all right. It's just the excitement.

1091
01:16:00,690 --> 01:16:03,887
Hurry, folks.
The fastest feet get the best seat.

1092
01:16:05,730 --> 01:16:07,800
See that man-eating elephant.

1093
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:11,646
See the cannon
that shoots a human being.

1094
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:17,929
- Now?
- Now.

1095
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:50,485
You monster.
You're responsible for this disgrace.

1096
01:16:50,610 --> 01:16:51,838
That's gratitude for you.

1097
01:16:51,930 --> 01:16:54,319
Most men get their sweethearts
one engagement ring.

1098
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:57,686
- I got you three rings.
- A circus. I'll be a laughingstock.

1099
01:16:57,770 --> 01:16:59,362
I see it all now.

1100
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:02,045
My nephew did this to humiliate me.

1101
01:17:02,130 --> 01:17:05,042
He did you a favor.
I was afraid Jardinet wouldn't get here...

1102
01:17:05,130 --> 01:17:06,643
so I wired Jeff to come and help us.

1103
01:17:06,730 --> 01:17:09,039
And there he is. Doing rather well,
don't you think?

1104
01:17:09,770 --> 01:17:13,649
<i>Step up and take a bow</i>

1105
01:17:13,770 --> 01:17:17,319
<i>Don't be modest, don't be shy</i>

1106
01:17:17,450 --> 01:17:21,125
<i>Show that thoroughbred look in your eye</i>

1107
01:17:21,330 --> 01:17:25,209
<i>Step up with grace and pride</i>

1108
01:17:25,290 --> 01:17:28,919
<i>Take that oompah, oompah, oompah-pah</i>

1109
01:17:29,010 --> 01:17:31,524
<i>In your stride</i>

1110
01:17:32,610 --> 01:17:36,398
<i>My heart began to beat in rhyme</i>

1111
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:40,240
<i>Oompah-pah, oomp in three-quarter time</i>

1112
01:17:40,330 --> 01:17:43,800
<i>You charmed me like that Lorelei</i>

1113
01:17:43,890 --> 01:17:48,327
<i>When you waltzed by</i>

1114
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:52,200
<i>You took my heart</i>

1115
01:17:52,290 --> 01:17:56,886
<i>And now here's to love</i>

1116
01:17:58,490 --> 01:18:01,960
<i>Take a bow</i>

1117
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:16,966
They liked the dinner you gave.
They'll eat this up, sawdust and all.

1118
01:18:17,050 --> 01:18:20,042
- But how about Jardinet?
- Probably on his way back to Paris.

1119
01:18:54,250 --> 01:18:56,525
Mrs. Dukesbury, speech!

1120
01:18:59,650 --> 01:19:01,527
See? You're a sensation.

1121
01:19:04,170 --> 01:19:05,603
I guess you're licked.

1122
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:08,605
I don't pay off until this show is over...

1123
01:19:08,690 --> 01:19:10,203
and this show ain't over yet.

1124
01:19:11,410 --> 01:19:14,482
And now, kiddies,
if you'll all pull up your chairs...

1125
01:19:14,570 --> 01:19:17,801
Suzie would like to mumble
a little doubletalk in Esperanto.

1126
01:19:17,890 --> 01:19:19,482
Here you are, sugar.

1127
01:19:19,690 --> 01:19:22,966
My few dear friends, I'm thrilled...

1128
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:25,206
- He might kill somebody.
- That's his business.

1129
01:19:25,290 --> 01:19:27,963
- I'm stopping the show.
- I don't want no part of this.

1130
01:19:39,930 --> 01:19:42,319
Get me out of this cannon!

1131
01:19:49,730 --> 01:19:51,766
Keep calm, folks. It's all part of the show.

1132
01:19:51,850 --> 01:19:53,329
Get me out of this cannon.

1133
01:19:54,970 --> 01:19:56,085
Please!

1134
01:20:35,770 --> 01:20:39,649
We're offering a $5-prize, folks,
for anyone who can pick out the ape.

1135
01:20:42,410 --> 01:20:44,207
Change your partners.

1136
01:20:46,010 --> 01:20:48,649
Help! He's got me!

1137
01:20:50,210 --> 01:20:52,678
I hope he's got
two pair of pants with that suit.

1138
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:57,161
Let me up there, you fool!

1139
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:04,685
Somebody do something!

1140
01:21:06,850 --> 01:21:08,078
There they go.

1141
01:21:08,170 --> 01:21:10,445
It's a great race
as they go into the back stretch.

1142
01:21:10,530 --> 01:21:12,919
Gibraltar leads,
but Carter and Punchy are hanging on.

1143
01:21:13,010 --> 01:21:14,204
Will Gibraltar make it?

1144
01:21:14,290 --> 01:21:16,520
They're in the home stretch.
Gibraltar still leads.

1145
01:21:16,610 --> 01:21:19,124
Carter is second by a trapeze.
Punchy's third by a heel.

1146
01:21:19,210 --> 01:21:21,519
Get me out of this cannon!

1147
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:23,999
Don't worry, Mrs. Dukesbury. I'll save you.

1148
01:21:24,090 --> 01:21:28,129
It looks like a driving finish.
And there goes Seabiscuit.

1149
01:21:29,850 --> 01:21:32,444
Oh, my goodness. Help me.

1150
01:21:32,530 --> 01:21:35,283
I'm sorry, Mrs. Dukesbury.
I didn't know it was loaded.

1151
01:21:40,890 --> 01:21:42,687
Here I come, Mrs. Dukesbury.

1152
01:21:43,530 --> 01:21:45,009
I save you again.

1153
01:21:45,970 --> 01:21:47,528
Swing your lady.

1154
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:50,966
Get ready now.
When I grab your ankles, you let go.

1155
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:53,281
Let go, I say.

1156
01:21:54,650 --> 01:21:55,719
Do you hear me?

1157
01:21:55,810 --> 01:21:58,370
Bring in the cage. Help me with the net.
Come on.

1158
01:22:00,850 --> 01:22:02,169
My dress!

1159
01:22:05,730 --> 01:22:07,880
Is there an insurance agent in the house?

1160
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:11,087
Help! Somebody save me!

1161
01:22:19,330 --> 01:22:20,445
Help!

1162
01:22:22,090 --> 01:22:23,808
Calling Tarzan.

1163
01:22:27,970 --> 01:22:30,689
Jump! It's all right. Come on, jump.

1164
01:22:32,330 --> 01:22:35,208
Do you think that they could hold me?
Oh, dear.

1165
01:22:36,010 --> 01:22:37,443
Here I go!

1166
01:22:39,010 --> 01:22:40,363
Here goes.

1167
01:22:41,770 --> 01:22:43,726
Call him off! Get him away!

1168
01:22:49,370 --> 01:22:50,928
Look. The money.

1169
01:22:52,210 --> 01:22:52,847
Is it all there?

1172
01:27:26,382 --> 01:27:28,771
I wish we never borrowed that money.

1173
01:27:29,382 --> 01:27:30,451
Well, we did.

1174
01:27:30,542 --> 01:27:32,817
Why don't you tell him we can't pay?

1175
01:27:32,982 --> 01:27:34,938
You're not afraid of Butch.

1176
01:27:36,022 --> 01:27:37,250
Or are you?

1177
01:27:38,102 --> 01:27:39,296
Who, me?

1178
01:27:40,342 --> 01:27:42,094
No! Let me go!

1179
01:27:43,342 --> 01:27:44,855
Nice work, Alexander.

1180
01:27:44,942 --> 01:27:46,136
Hey, wait a minute.

1181
01:27:46,262 --> 01:27:49,220
Hey, Woim, those mugs owe some dough,
don't they?

1182
01:27:49,662 --> 01:27:52,938
Yeah, boss, 37 cents.
Due tomorrow at 12 bells.

1183
01:27:53,142 --> 01:27:54,814
We need an expansion.

1184
01:27:54,902 --> 01:27:56,415
You see that kid?

1185
01:27:57,022 --> 01:27:58,694
He tried to stall me.

1186
01:27:59,062 --> 01:28:00,381
You old skinnyflint...

1187
01:28:00,502 --> 01:28:03,892
what if you had a dog
with two busted legs to take care of?

1188
01:28:04,102 --> 01:28:05,774
Dogs is your funeral.

1189
01:28:05,982 --> 01:28:09,452
I'll be around to collect the dough
tomorrow at 12:00 noon.

1190
01:28:13,542 --> 01:28:15,419
It's all the dog's fault.

1191
01:28:16,302 --> 01:28:19,135
Well, somebody had to take care of him.

1192
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:27,021
Well, Duke, am I glad to see you.

1193
01:28:27,862 --> 01:28:29,375
Duke? Is that your dog?

1194
01:28:29,502 --> 01:28:31,936
Why he's our mascot.
How did he get hurt?

1195
01:28:32,182 --> 01:28:33,695
A car hit him, I guess.

1196
01:28:33,822 --> 01:28:35,221
We found him in the gutter.

1197
01:28:35,382 --> 01:28:37,100
He was all banged up.

1198
01:28:37,862 --> 01:28:40,774
Well, look. You're swell kids.
Now I'll tell you what you do.

1199
01:28:40,862 --> 01:28:43,740
Take this
and go buy yourselves some ice cream.

1200
01:28:47,862 --> 01:28:49,261
Bye, Duke!

1201
01:28:52,942 --> 01:28:54,580
Boy, a whole buck.

1202
01:28:54,662 --> 01:28:56,254
Now we can pay Butch.

1203
01:28:56,582 --> 01:28:58,140
I'll pay Butch.

1204
01:29:06,102 --> 01:29:08,616
Hope the old goat gets a tummy ache.

1205
01:29:13,302 --> 01:29:15,975
Say, Wilbur, how would you like
to join our gang?

1206
01:29:16,062 --> 01:29:18,098
Only cost you 37 cents.

1207
01:29:18,582 --> 01:29:20,971
Splendid! I've always desired
to gain admission...

1208
01:29:21,062 --> 01:29:22,734
in your splendid organization.

1209
01:29:22,862 --> 01:29:24,659
He's going to lend us the dough.

1210
01:29:24,742 --> 01:29:26,016
Oh, boy!

1211
01:29:27,702 --> 01:29:30,262
It appears I'm financially embarrassed.

1212
01:29:30,542 --> 01:29:32,055
Oh, gee...

1213
01:29:32,222 --> 01:29:33,291
Look!

1214
01:29:40,982 --> 01:29:43,257
What a funny-looking little duck.

1215
01:29:43,742 --> 01:29:45,221
It's a penguin.

1216
01:29:45,342 --> 01:29:47,139
- A what?
- A penguin.

1217
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:51,216
An aquatic bird
belonging to the genus <i>Eudyptes sclateri...</i>

1218
01:29:51,502 --> 01:29:53,857
His habitat is chiefly
in the Arctic Regions...

1219
01:29:53,942 --> 01:29:58,333
and it subsists on mollusks, crustaceans,
and other piscatorial delicacies.

1220
01:29:58,902 --> 01:30:00,255
Well, what do they eat?

1221
01:30:00,342 --> 01:30:01,252
Fish.

1222
01:30:01,342 --> 01:30:03,412
I've got a pocketful of bait.

1223
01:30:03,622 --> 01:30:05,533
Now he's got a couple of dogs.

1224
01:30:05,862 --> 01:30:08,376
The dogs' curiosity is aroused
by the penguin...

1225
01:30:08,462 --> 01:30:12,011
and the penguin's appetite is aroused
by Porky's piscatorial possession.

1226
01:30:12,462 --> 01:30:13,815
I mean, fish.

1227
01:30:17,982 --> 01:30:21,179
Say, didn't we get $1 for finding one dog?

1228
01:30:21,262 --> 01:30:22,297
Yes.

1229
01:30:22,662 --> 01:30:24,539
One dog, $1.

1230
01:30:25,062 --> 01:30:27,018
Two dogs, $2.

1231
01:30:27,302 --> 01:30:29,179
Ten dogs, $10.

1232
01:30:32,982 --> 01:30:35,496
Boy, have we got the dogs.

1233
01:30:36,022 --> 01:30:38,582
All we have to do now
is to rake in the dough.

1234
01:30:39,182 --> 01:30:40,774
Here's the paper.

1235
01:30:43,622 --> 01:30:44,896
Listen to this.

1236
01:30:44,982 --> 01:30:48,657
"Lost Airedale, lost poodle, lost Scottie.

1237
01:30:49,462 --> 01:30:52,260
"Generous reward." Oh, boy!

1238
01:30:55,222 --> 01:30:56,621
Oh, look at this.

1239
01:30:57,102 --> 01:30:59,377
"Pet-stealing wave hits city.

1240
01:30:59,862 --> 01:31:02,251
"Entire police force hunts crooks."

1241
01:31:05,342 --> 01:31:06,457
There's the duck.

1242
01:31:12,502 --> 01:31:14,413
Are we in trouble now.

1243
01:31:15,222 --> 01:31:17,133
Are we going to jail?

1244
01:31:17,542 --> 01:31:20,739
Yes, if they catch us
with those dogs and that duck.

1245
01:31:22,782 --> 01:31:25,342
Get away from me, duck!
Get away from me!

1246
01:31:26,182 --> 01:31:28,173
Let's get them out of here.

1247
01:31:29,182 --> 01:31:32,333
<i>Calling all cars.</i>
<i>Keep sharp lookout for petnappers.</i>

1248
01:31:32,662 --> 01:31:36,371
Hold it, the cops are on our tails.
Keep them mutts quiet.

1249
01:31:37,782 --> 01:31:39,534
<i>Question all people with dogs.</i>

1250
01:31:39,622 --> 01:31:40,941
Get them some bones.

1251
01:31:41,022 --> 01:31:43,490
I guess we better. Come on, Buckwheat.

1252
01:31:57,022 --> 01:31:59,490
This is a disgrace to our fair city here.

1253
01:31:59,582 --> 01:32:01,379
There's the captain now.

1254
01:32:02,142 --> 01:32:06,021
Captain Pindle,
we are so sorry you've lost your penguin.

1255
01:32:06,102 --> 01:32:08,491
We did so want to hear your lecture.

1256
01:32:08,662 --> 01:32:11,540
If I don't find my JoJo, my career's ended.

1257
01:32:11,622 --> 01:32:13,340
My life's work is ruined.

1258
01:32:13,422 --> 01:32:16,653
You have our sympathy
because we've all lost our dogs.

1259
01:32:17,542 --> 01:32:20,852
I beg pardon, but I can put you
on the track of your missing canines.

1260
01:32:20,942 --> 01:32:21,897
What?

1261
01:32:22,142 --> 01:32:24,451
Of course, you'll have to pay
a small reward.

1262
01:32:24,542 --> 01:32:26,055
A mere 37 cents.

1263
01:32:26,262 --> 01:32:28,014
- They have my JoJo?
- Where are they?

1264
01:32:28,102 --> 01:32:30,980
- Who stole them?
- They didn't steal them, they just...

1265
01:32:31,222 --> 01:32:32,177
Where are they?

1266
01:32:32,622 --> 01:32:34,772
Those boys over there just...

1267
01:32:39,742 --> 01:32:42,051
Oh, my gracious! What have I done?

1268
01:32:44,862 --> 01:32:47,501
Where's my JoJo? Catch those thieves!

1269
01:32:57,222 --> 01:32:59,975
If we could only get those dogs
out of here.

1270
01:33:05,982 --> 01:33:07,734
Say, I've got an idea.

1271
01:33:07,822 --> 01:33:09,335
Porky, come here.

1272
01:33:13,582 --> 01:33:14,935
I want JoJo!

1273
01:33:16,102 --> 01:33:17,820
Catch those thieves. Stop them!

1274
01:33:19,142 --> 01:33:22,020
Now you know
what you're supposed to do, Porky.

1275
01:33:22,102 --> 01:33:24,138
Take him away and lose him.

1276
01:33:25,302 --> 01:33:27,338
Come, ducky, come on.

1277
01:34:02,382 --> 01:34:05,818
Hey, kid, where does that bunch
of Our Gang kids hang out?

1278
01:34:07,382 --> 01:34:08,781
Are you after them, too?

1279
01:34:08,862 --> 01:34:10,500
What's the matter, sonny?

1280
01:34:11,542 --> 01:34:13,976
They're in such trouble and I...

1281
01:34:14,062 --> 01:34:15,177
Well, tell us about it.

1282
01:34:32,542 --> 01:34:33,736
They're after us.

1283
01:34:33,822 --> 01:34:36,495
- Where's Porky?
- He's out losing the dogs.

1284
01:34:37,382 --> 01:34:39,942
Gee, they're all gone!

1285
01:34:43,742 --> 01:34:45,300
Where's my JoJo?

1286
01:34:46,102 --> 01:34:47,296
Where are the dogs?

1287
01:34:47,382 --> 01:34:49,134
We ain't got your dogs.

1288
01:34:49,342 --> 01:34:51,173
I'm gonna look around.

1289
01:34:59,342 --> 01:35:00,980
Who's all the people?

1290
01:35:01,062 --> 01:35:03,701
Never mind about the people.
Did you lose the dogs?

1291
01:35:04,942 --> 01:35:06,694
Good old Porky.

1292
01:35:06,822 --> 01:35:09,461
Here's my Cleopatra's collar.
Where is she?

1293
01:35:09,742 --> 01:35:13,894
Listen, ma'am, if you find a dog in here,
I'll eat it.

1294
01:35:20,422 --> 01:35:21,616
There he is!

1295
01:35:23,662 --> 01:35:25,653
Okay, let's get out of here.

1296
01:35:31,262 --> 01:35:33,253
We is in the jailhouse now.

1297
01:35:35,542 --> 01:35:36,895
Hey, what's going on here?

1298
01:35:36,982 --> 01:35:38,495
They stole my dog.

1299
01:35:38,582 --> 01:35:40,618
Wait a minute. One at a time.

1300
01:35:41,302 --> 01:35:43,862
Ladies, you don't know
the inside story of this.

1301
01:35:45,582 --> 01:35:47,095
Will you please listen?

1302
01:35:47,182 --> 01:35:48,934
Will you please enforce the law?

1303
01:35:49,022 --> 01:35:50,455
Enforce the law?

1304
01:35:50,542 --> 01:35:53,375
All right.
Have you got a license for that dog?

1305
01:35:53,782 --> 01:35:54,737
Well, I...

1306
01:35:54,822 --> 01:35:55,777
How about you?

1307
01:35:55,862 --> 01:35:56,817
I'll be going.

1308
01:35:56,902 --> 01:35:58,972
How about all the rest of you?

1309
01:36:03,622 --> 01:36:05,499
There are those money lenders.

1310
01:36:05,782 --> 01:36:08,933
Sweeney, pay them their 37 cents
and chase them away.

1311
01:36:09,182 --> 01:36:11,218
Gee, thanks!

1312
01:36:12,182 --> 01:36:15,140
And, Sweeney,
get the wagon ready for these guys.

1313
01:36:15,382 --> 01:36:16,292
Okay.

1314
01:36:16,582 --> 01:36:18,220
I'm ashamed of you.

1315
01:36:18,422 --> 01:36:20,652
Saving our mascot was a fine thing...

1316
01:36:20,902 --> 01:36:23,939
but trying to make money
out of being kind to dogs is different.

1317
01:36:24,022 --> 01:36:26,695
You can't sell kindness.
Don't you know that?

1318
01:36:27,102 --> 01:36:29,218
We didn't even sell a nickel's worth.

1319
01:36:29,302 --> 01:36:31,372
All we got was trouble.

1320
01:36:31,982 --> 01:36:33,335
All right, come on.

1321
01:36:35,942 --> 01:36:37,819
I don't wanna go to that old jail.

1322
01:36:40,662 --> 01:36:43,096
- Go on, try it. It's yours.
- Ours?

1323
01:36:43,182 --> 01:36:46,970
It's from the boys at the stationhouse
for taking such good care of Duke.

1324
01:36:52,182 --> 01:36:53,854
- Are you ready?
- Here we go.

1325
