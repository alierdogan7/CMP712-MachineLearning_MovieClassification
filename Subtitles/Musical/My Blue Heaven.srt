I mean, why?

492
00:28:05,213 --> 00:28:10,843
Because for the first three years of our
marriage, there was no sign of a family.

493
00:28:11,094 --> 00:28:14,097
I was afraid I was gonna become
one of those frustrated women.

494
00:28:14,305 --> 00:28:16,599
So out of desperation,
we decided to adopt one.

495
00:28:16,807 --> 00:28:21,521
Then, brother. One, two, three in a row.
I was afraid to shake hands with her.

496
00:28:21,729 --> 00:28:24,023
I guess it was because
I stopped worrying.

497
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,650
But you said Tony too.

498
00:28:25,858 --> 00:28:27,860
JANET: His mother and father
died in an accident.

499
00:28:28,027 --> 00:28:30,154
He wasn't quite 3 months old
when we got him.

500
00:28:30,363 --> 00:28:33,491
I thought it might be a good idea
if you would consider...

501
00:28:33,658 --> 00:28:34,909
Where did you get them?

502
00:28:35,075 --> 00:28:36,786
JANET:
Through the Sarah Wilson Foundation.

503
00:28:36,994 --> 00:28:39,914
I'll give you the address
in case you ever want...

504
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:45,377
- Well, I bows to you.
- And nods accordingly.

505
00:28:46,712 --> 00:28:48,213
Likewise.

506
00:28:49,882 --> 00:28:53,010
The reason we came out here
was to try and talk you two...

507
00:28:53,218 --> 00:28:55,805
...into doing a television show.
That right, Kitty?

508
00:28:55,971 --> 00:28:57,598
What? Oh, yes.

509
00:28:57,848 --> 00:29:00,475
Why, you inconsiderate
city-bred fella, you.

510
00:29:00,726 --> 00:29:03,145
Do you think I'd give up my book,
leave this farm for that?

- Unless, of course, it pays money.

512
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,567

- A mere pittance.

JACK: Oh, yes.

WALTER: Well, let's drink it over.

- We might as well go in and look.

we have to take one we don't like?

517

Oh, I think you can at least
pick and choose.

- You bet he is.

00:29:55,447 --> 00:29:58,492

in any other home or agency?

00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,369
- No.

Oh, there's nothing
to worry about, really.

537
00:30:35,403 --> 00:30:39,323
It's just that we've had two or three
rather unfortunate experiences...

538
00:30:39,573 --> 00:30:42,118
...with people from the stage,
and Mrs. Johnston...

539
00:30:42,326 --> 00:30:46,747
That's she there on the wall.
... Sarah Wilson was her mother.

540
00:30:46,998 --> 00:30:48,749
Well, she's a wonderful woman, but...

541
00:30:48,957 --> 00:30:52,086
She doesn't think that actors
are parent material, is that it?

542
00:30:52,295 --> 00:30:54,130
Oh, there's no set rule.

543
00:30:54,338 --> 00:30:58,301
It all depends on the individual
and the kind of program that you do.

544
00:30:58,509 --> 00:30:59,927
We have a comedy program.

545
00:31:00,136 --> 00:31:02,846

known to sing and dance.

Oh, I suppose I should be ashamed
to admit it...

547

to programs like that.

that's the kind of thing I like.

549
00:31:12,147 --> 00:31:14,733
Just last night,
I was listening to this program.

550
00:31:14,858 --> 00:31:17,110
There was a detective,
he was on a case...

551
00:31:17,277 --> 00:31:20,072
...oh, I forget what it was,
but, oh, it was thrilling.

552
00:31:20,238 --> 00:31:23,366
I don't know how they ever think
up all those things, do you?

553
00:31:23,534 --> 00:31:25,368
It's one of the mysteries of the ages.

554
00:31:25,453 --> 00:31:27,580
Would it be possible
to see the babies...

555
00:31:27,788 --> 00:31:29,873
...and give you an idea
of what we'd like?

556
00:31:30,082 --> 00:31:34,169
Oh, but there aren't any babies
available at the moment, Mrs. Moran.

557
00:31:34,377 --> 00:31:36,296
It may take weeks, months.

have had to wait as much as a year.

In the meanwhile, I'm certainly
going to be watching for your program.

00:32:08,578 --> 00:32:11,331

a few squeaky doors first.

I'd make a wonderful father.

- Just for a while? I'll give you a kiss.

1138
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:57,294
- Okay?
- You're a hussy.

1139
01:10:57,502 --> 01:10:59,879
Of course, you realize
if you ever get the idea...

1140
01:11:00,004 --> 01:11:03,175
...that Gloria's really as good as I am,
I'll have to shoot you.

1141
01:11:03,341 --> 01:11:04,759
Good.

1142
01:11:19,023 --> 01:11:21,233
Kitty. Walter, there's Kitty.

1143
01:11:21,401 --> 01:11:23,611
Kitty. Kitty, wait a minute.

1144
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:26,448
Janet. Walter. What in the world
are you doing up here?

1145
01:11:26,614 --> 01:11:30,367
We can't go to a nice, cheap dentist,
we have to go to a Fifth Avenue dentist.

1146
01:11:30,535 --> 01:11:32,203
Look at the braces, Mrs. Moran.

1147
01:11:32,411 --> 01:11:34,539
- Don't they look awful?
- They're not too bad.

the cob like a lady, and she complains.

...a nice toothless grin, huh?

- You sure have changed, then.

and you had dark hair.

You should go back to work.

your legs to speak our lines...

- It's a thought.

1165
01:12:18,082 --> 01:12:21,418
I wish you would, Mrs. Moran.
I don't like that old Gloria Adams.

1166
01:12:21,585 --> 01:12:23,962
- Laura.
- Well, I don't, Mother. She's so pushy.

1167
01:12:24,129 --> 01:12:26,215
She acts as if she's in love
with Mr. Moran.

1168
01:12:26,382 --> 01:12:27,424
That'll do, Laura.

were your husband...

- Laura, be quiet.
- I'm sorry.

Kind of warm for summer, isn't it?

Goodbye, pet. You must come over

Yes, let me take your coat off, huh?

- Lipstick. Well, now, how... Excuse me.

- How do you suppose it got there?
- I can't imagine.

A lovely shade.
What do you call it?

Don't interrupt, Jack.
I haven't heard gossip for weeks.

- Later.

Oh, yes, about you and Jack.

- Sure you won't sit down?
- No, thank you.

and two gentlemen come in.

the baby was his...

1378

...and he want his
flesh and blood back.

1379

and if I didn't give the baby back...

1380
01:26:26,419 --> 01:26:29,505
- ... they'd call the police.
- No.

Oh, Miss Kitty, I tried to stop them.

would touch that baby...

But they wouldn't pay me no mind.

They must come either through
definitely established adoption homes...

...or with the sanction of the courts.

1398

the courts bend backwards...
