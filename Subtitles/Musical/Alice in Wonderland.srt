Where is the land
beyond the isles

To a babbling brook

00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,403
I know,

191
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:15,824
but l..l..l
just can't stop.

192
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,994
Say,
this won't do.

193
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,416
It won't do
at all.

194
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,920
You!
You up there.

195
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,922
Stop!
Stop, I say!

196
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:31,423
Oh, look!

197
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:32,925
The bottle.

198
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,343
The bot--

199
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:45,771
Oh, dear.

200
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,106
I wish I hadn't

201
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,525
cried so much.

202
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,950
A sailor's life
is the life for me

203
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:00,452
How I love to sail
o'er the bounding sea

204
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:02,788
And I never never ever
do a thing about the weather

205
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:05,374
For the weather never ever
does a thing for me

206
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,750
Oh

207
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,752
A sailor's life
is the life for me

208
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:09,920
Tiddlee um pom pom

209
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,129
Deedle dum dum dee

210
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:12,214
And I never--

211
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:13,298
Ahoy!

212
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:15,259
Another nautical
expression.

213
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:16,844
Land ho, by Jove.

214
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,554
Where away, Dodo?

215
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:19,596
Dodo?

216
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,431
Three points
to starboard.

217
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,559
Pull away,
me hearties.

218
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:26,603
Have you in port
in no time.

219
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,105
Mr. Dodo!

220
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:31,108
Please! Please help me!

221
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,406
Pardon me,
but, uh...

222
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:41,326
would you mind
helping me, please?

223
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,287
Yoo hoo!

224
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,788
Yoo hoo!

225
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,290
Help me!

226
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,457
Please!

227
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:52,462
Help me!

228
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,341
Forward, backward,
inward, outward

229
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:58,010
Come and join
the chase

230
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:01,305
Nothing could be drier
than ajolly caucus race

231
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,806
Backward, forward,
outward, inward

232
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:04,308
Bottom to the top

233
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,642
Never a beginning

234
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,769
There can never
be a stop

235
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:09,271
To skipping,
hopping, tripping

236
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:10,939
Fancy free and gay

237
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:13,609
I started it tomorrow,
but will finish yesterday

238
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,360
Round and round
and round we go

239
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:17,112
Until forever more

240
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:20,282
Once we were behind,
but now we find we are

241
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:21,825
Forward, backward,
inward, outward

242
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:23,452
Come and join
the chase

243
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:26,121
Nothing could be drier
than ajolly caucus race

244
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:30,167
I say, you'll never
get dry that way.

245
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:31,293
Get dry?

246
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:35,297
You have to run
with the others.

247
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,174
But how can l--

248
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:41,637
Have you dry
in no time.

249
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,973
No one can get dry
this way.

250
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:47,226
Nonsense.
I'm dry already.

251
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,977
Yes, but--

252
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,395
All right, chaps,

253
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:51,980
Iook lively!

254
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,400
The white rabbit.

255
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:57,069
Mr. Rabbit!

256
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:58,487
Mr. Rabbit!

257
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:00,656
My goodness.
I'm late! I'm late!

258
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:01,990
I'll be back.

259
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:04,743
I'm late,
I'm late, I'm late!

260
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,703
Stop kicking
that mackerel.

261
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,376
Mr. Rabbit!

262
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,877
Oh, Mr. Rabbit!

263
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:16,088
Oh, dear.

264
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:18,382
I'm sure he came
this way.

265
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,425
Could he be hiding?

266
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,594
Hmm.

267
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,097
Not here.

268
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:27,933
I wonder...

269
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:40,904
No. I suppose
he must have--

270
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:43,782
Why, what peculiar
little figures.

271
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:47,578
Tweedle Dee
and Tweedle Dum.

272
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:48,954
Honk!

273
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,915
If you think we're waxworks,
you ought to pay.

274
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,960
If you think we're alive,
you ought to speak to us.

275
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,087
Beep!

276
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:57,921
Honk!

277
00:13:58,005 --> 00:13:58,755
Beep!

278
00:13:58,839 --> 00:13:59,590
Honk!

279
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:00,424
Beep!

280
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:01,425
Honk!

281
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:02,426
Beep!
Honk!

282
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,552
That's logic!

283
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:06,430
Well, it's been nice
meeting you.

284
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,432
Good-bye.

285
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:09,933
You're beginning
backwards.

286
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:12,936
The first thing
is to say...

287
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:14,396
" How do you do"
and shake hands

288
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:15,439
Shake hands

289
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:16,815
Shake hands

290
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:18,066
" How do you do"
and shake hands

291
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,943
State your name
and business

292
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,403
That's manners!
That's manners!

293
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:22,946
Really?

294
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:24,948
My name is Alice.

295
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,451
I'm following
a white rabbit.

296
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:28,952
You can't go yet.

297
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:30,913
The visit is
just started.

298
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:31,997
Sorry.

299
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,958
Like to play
hide-and-seek

300
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,419
or who's got
the button?

301
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:41,256
If you stay long enough,
we might battle.

302
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:42,758
That's very kind.

303
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,343
But I must be going.

304
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:46,094
Why?
Why?

305
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:48,764
I'm following
a white rabbit.

306
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:51,683
I'm curious to know
where he's going.

307
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:53,936
Oh, she's curious.

308
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:55,479
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

309
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:58,023
The oysters
were curious, too.

310
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:02,194
Aye. And you remember
what happened to them.

311
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:05,280
Poor things.
Poor things.

312
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:08,450
Why? What happened
to the oysters?

313
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:10,369
You wouldn't
be interested.

314
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:13,372
You're in too much
ofa hurry.

315
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:15,791
Perhaps, I could
spare a little time.

316
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,544
You could? Well...

317
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,837
Beep!

318
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,381
The walrusand
the carpenter.

319
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:25,884
Or the story
of the curious oysters.

320
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:27,219
Honk!

321
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:28,637
Beep! Beep!

322
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:30,889
Honk!

323
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:33,058
The sun was
shining on the sea

324
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,810
Shining
with all its might

325
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,854
He did his
very best to make

326
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,189
The billows
smooth and bright

327
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:42,067
And this was odd
because it was...

328
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,486
The middle
of the night

329
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:54,580
The walrus
and the carpenter

330
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,582
Were walking
close at hand

331
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:58,584
The beach was wide
from side to side

332
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,336
But much
too full of sand

333
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,255
Mr. Walrus,
said the carpenter

334
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:05,757
My brain
begins to perk

335
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:07,843
We'll sweep this clear
in 'alfa year

336
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:09,761
lf you don't mind
the work

337
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:12,514
Work!
Uh...brrrr.

338
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:13,682
The time has come

339
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,225
The walrus said--

340
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:16,727
To talk
of other things

341
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,229
Of shoes and ships
and sealing wax

342
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:21,231
And cabbages
and kings

343
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:23,692
And why the sea
is boiling hot

344
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:25,527
And whether
pigs have wings

345
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:29,031
Calloo, callay,
no work today

346
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:32,534
We're cabbages
and kings

347
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:43,962
[Whistling]

348
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:07,444
Oh...oysters,
come and walk with us.

349
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:09,947
The day
is warm and bright.

350
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,574
A pleasant walk,
a pleasant talk

351
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:14,827
would be
a sheer delight.

352
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,788
Should we get hungry
on the way,

353
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:20,541
we'll stop
and have a bite.

354
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:23,126
A-hem.

355
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:26,338
But mother oyster
winked her eye

356
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,632
And shook
her heavy head

357
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,300
She knew too well

358
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:33,637
This was no time
to leave her oyster bed

359
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,848
The sea is nice.

360
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:37,432
Take my advice.

361
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:38,892
Stay right here.

362
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:40,894
Mum said.

363
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:42,187
Yes, yes,
of course...

364
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:44,022
Ha ha!

365
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,066
The time has come,
my little friends

366
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:48,569
To talk
of other things

367
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,821
Of shoes and ships
and sealing wax

368
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,489
Of cabbages
and kings

369
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:55,200
And why the sea
is boiling hot

370
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:58,495
And, uh...whether
pigs have wings, ho ho

371
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:01,665
Calloo, callay,
come run away

372
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:04,835
We're the cabbages
and kings

373
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:44,291

Ah! I'm late!

560
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:06,817
I'm here!
I should be there!

561
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:08,819
Have a match?

562
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:10,404
Must go!
Good-bye!

563
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:12,406
I'm late!

564
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:13,949
Please wait!

565
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:16,451
Doyou
have a match?

566
00:26:16,535 --> 00:26:18,287
No. Sorry.
Mr. Rabbit!

567
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:21,081
No cooperation.
No cooperation at all.

568
00:26:21,165 --> 00:26:23,292
Can't have
monsters about.

569
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,836
Have to
carry on alone.

570
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:31,758
Wait. Please!

571
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:33,802
Just a minute!

572
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:35,304
Oh, dear.

573
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:39,266
I'll never catch him
while I'm this small.

574
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:40,475
Why...

575
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,269
curious butterflies.

576
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:44,813
You mean bread
and butterflies.

577
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:46,481
Of course--mmm?

578
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,860
Now, who do you suppose...

579
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:54,031
[Whinny]

580
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:55,824
A horsefly.

581
00:26:55,908 --> 00:26:59,286
I mean, uh...
a rocking horsefly.

582
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:00,787
Naturally.

583
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:04,374
I beg your pardon,
but did you...

584
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:09,046
That's nonsense.
Flowers can't talk.

585
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:11,965
But of course
we can talk, my dear.

586
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:13,800
If there's
anyone worth
talking to.

587
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:15,969
Or about.
Ha ha!

588
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:18,013
We sing, too.

589
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:19,264
You do?

590
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,643
Let's sing
TeIllt To the Tulips.

591
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:25,312
Or about
shy little violets.

592
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:28,232
Sing Lovely
Lily of the Valley.

593
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:30,067
She'd hate it.

594
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:35,447
Girls! We shall sing
Golden Afternoon.

595
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:37,366
That's about
all ofus.

596
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:40,702
Sound your "A", Lily.

597
00:27:40,786 --> 00:27:43,372
La

598
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:45,207
Mi
 Mi
 Mi

599
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,875
La la la

600
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:48,710
Ah ah ah ah

601
00:27:48,794 --> 00:27:50,671
Dum du dum dum

602
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:52,172
Poom

603
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:55,300
Ah-poom mm-hmm
poom oow poom poom

604
00:27:55,384 --> 00:27:58,637
Ah-poom mm-hmm
poom oow oow oow

605
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,724
Little bread and butterflies
kiss the tulips

606
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:05,477
And the sun is like
a toy balloon

607
00:28:05,561 --> 00:28:06,979
Oo-ooo

608
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:10,941
There are
get-up-in-the-morning glories

609
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:13,318
ln the golden afternoon

610
00:28:13,402 --> 00:28:14,987
Oo-ooo

611
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,866
There are dizzy daffodils
on the hillside

612
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:22,995
Strings of violets
are all in tune

613
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:27,040
Tiger lilies
love the dandelions

614
00:28:27,124 --> 00:28:29,835
ln the golden afternoon

615
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:33,088
The golden afternoon

616
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:35,174
There are
dog and caterpillars

617
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:37,342
And a copper centipede

618
00:28:37,426 --> 00:28:40,053
Where the lazy daisies

619
00:28:40,137 --> 00:28:42,764
Love the very

620
00:28:42,848 --> 00:28:45,809
Peaceful life

621
00:28:45,851 --> 00:28:52,065
They lead

622
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:56,236
You can learn a lot
ofthings from the flowers

623
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,989
For especially
in the month of June

624
00:28:59,031 --> 00:29:00,866
Ah ah ah ah

625
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:05,245
There's a wealth
of happiness and romance

626
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:06,413
All

627
00:29:06,497 --> 00:29:10,959
ln the golden afternoon

628
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:34,816
All in
the golden afternoon

629
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,026
The golden

630
00:29:36,068 --> 00:29:39,404
Afternoon

631
00:29:41,198 --> 00:29:43,909
You can learn
a lot ofthings

632
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:46,703
From the flowers

633
00:29:46,745 --> 00:29:52,042
For especially
in the month of June

634
00:29:52,084 --> 00:29:54,545
There's a wealth
of happiness

635
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:58,006
And romance

636
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,341
[Voice breaks]

637
00:30:00,676 --> 00:30:05,430
All in
the golden afternoon

638
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:10,727
Ah-ha

639
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:14,648
Ah

640
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:16,441
[Crash]

641
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:21,071
Oh, that was lovely!

642
00:30:21,113 --> 00:30:23,073
Thank you,
my dear.

643
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:24,908
What garden
are you from?

644
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,577
I don't come
from any garden.

645
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:28,912
Maybe she's
a wildflower!

646
00:30:28,954 --> 00:30:31,582
I'm not a wildflower.

647
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:36,044
What specie or genus
are you, my dear?

648
00:30:36,128 --> 00:30:41,425
I suppose you'd call
me a genus humanus Alice.

649
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:44,928
Ever see an Alice with
a blossom like that?

650
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,890
Did you ever
see an Alice?

651
00:30:47,973 --> 00:30:51,143
Did you notice
her petals?

652
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:53,437
What a peculiar
color.

653
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:54,980
And no fragrance.

654
00:30:55,063 --> 00:30:58,275
Just look
at those stems!

655
00:30:58,317 --> 00:31:00,235
Rather scrawny,
I'd say.

656
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:01,820
I think
she's pretty.

657
00:31:01,904 --> 00:31:03,238
Quiet, Bud.

658
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:05,574
I'm not a flower!

659
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:06,992
Just as I suspected!

660
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:11,330
She's nothing
but a common mobile vulgaris.

661
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:13,624
Oh, no!
Oh, no!

662
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:14,958
A common what?

663
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,544
To be blunt--
a weed!

664
00:31:17,628 --> 00:31:19,505
I'm not a weed!

665
00:31:19,588 --> 00:31:21,507
She wouldn't admit it.

666
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,008
Can you imagine?

667
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:24,009
Goodness!

668
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:26,178
Don't go to seed here!

669
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:27,596
Go on, now!

670
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:28,722
Go!

671
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:32,142
We don't want weeds
in our bed!

672
00:31:32,184 --> 00:31:33,477
Move along!

673
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,436
Toot!

674
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,687
Meoooow!

675
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:37,689
Arf!. Arf!. Arf!.

676
00:31:37,773 --> 00:31:41,485
All right,
if that's how you feel.

677
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:44,446
If l were
my right size,

678
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:47,032
I could pick
each of you!

679
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:48,992
That'd
teach you.

680
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:51,036
Ha ha ha ha!

681
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,961
You can learn a lot
from the flowers.

682
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:03,340
Hmph! They could learn
a lot about manners.

683
00:32:06,718 --> 00:32:09,346
A

684
00:32:09,388 --> 00:32:13,934
E I O U

685
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:18,856

A E I O U

687
00:32:25,237 --> 00:32:27,823

688
00:32:27,906 --> 00:32:32,286

689
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:38,208

A E I O U

691
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:52,264
Who...

692
00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:53,265
are...

693
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:55,058
you?

694
00:32:55,142 --> 00:32:57,311
Why, I hardly
know, sir.

695
00:32:57,352 --> 00:33:01,106
I've changed so many times,
you see--

696
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,108
I do not see.

697
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:04,693
Explain yourself.

698
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:07,821
I can't explain
myself, sir,

699
00:33:07,863 --> 00:33:10,449
because I'm not
myself, you know.

700
00:33:10,532 --> 00:33:12,910
I do not know.

701
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:14,745
I can't be clearer.

702
00:33:14,828 --> 00:33:17,080
It isn't
clear to me.

703
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:18,123
You?

704
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:21,293
Who are you?

705
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:23,795
Well, you ought
to tell me--

706
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:26,757
[Cough cough]

707
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,258
Who...

708
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:30,552
you are first.

709
00:33:30,636 --> 00:33:31,845
Why?

710
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:36,475
Oh, dear. Everything
is so confusing.

711
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:37,768
It is not.

712
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:39,144
It is to me.

713
00:33:39,228 --> 00:33:40,479
Why?

714
00:33:40,562 --> 00:33:43,482
I can't remember
things as I used to.

715
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:44,483
Recite.

716
00:33:44,566 --> 00:33:45,400
Hmm?

717
00:33:45,442 --> 00:33:47,820
Oh! Yes, sir.

718
00:33:47,903 --> 00:33:48,987
Um...

719
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:51,281
how doth the
little busy bee

720
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:52,825
improve each--

721
00:33:52,908 --> 00:33:53,826
Stop!

722
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:57,788
That is not spoken
correcti-cally.

723
00:33:57,871 --> 00:33:59,331
It goes...

724
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:02,835
how...

725
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:10,551
Ha ha ha ha.

726
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:12,845
A-hem.

727
00:34:12,928 --> 00:34:15,222
How doth the little
crocodile

728
00:34:15,264 --> 00:34:17,766
improve his shining tail

729
00:34:17,808 --> 00:34:21,228
and pour the waters
ofthe Nile

730
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:23,689
on every golden scale?

731
00:34:23,772 --> 00:34:25,315
How cheer--

732
00:34:26,483 --> 00:34:27,568
How cheer--

733
00:34:30,279 --> 00:34:31,572
A-hem!

734
00:34:31,613 --> 00:34:34,116
Ha ha ha ha.

735
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:37,870
How cheerfully
he seems to grin.

736
00:34:37,953 --> 00:34:41,248
How neatly
spreads his claws.

737
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:43,792
And welcomes
little fishes in

738
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:47,379
with gently smiling jaws.

739
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:50,924
I've never heard it
that way before.

740
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:53,969
I have improved it.

741
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:54,970
Well...

742
00:34:55,012 --> 00:34:56,263
[Cough cough]

743
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:58,265
If you ask me--

744
00:34:58,307 --> 00:34:59,600
You?

745
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:02,477
Who are you?

746
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:04,813
[Cough cough]

747
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:06,273
[Cough cough]

748
00:35:06,315 --> 00:35:07,858
Ah-choo!

749
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:10,861
Oh!

750
00:35:19,328 --> 00:35:20,746
You there!

751
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:21,747
Girl!

752
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,248
Wait!

753
00:35:23,332 --> 00:35:25,042
Come back!

754
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,252
I have something
important to say!

755
00:35:27,336 --> 00:35:29,546
Oh, dear.

756
00:35:30,881 --> 00:35:33,884
I wonder what
he wants now.

757
00:35:36,887 --> 00:35:38,055
Oh!

758
00:35:45,521 --> 00:35:46,730
Well?

759
00:35:48,565 --> 00:35:51,860
Keep your temper.

760
00:35:51,902 --> 00:35:53,487
Is that all?

761
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:55,572
No.

762
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,953
Exacti-cally
what is your problem?

763
00:36:01,036 --> 00:36:02,663
Well,
it's exactic--

764
00:36:02,746 --> 00:36:03,831
Exactic--

765
00:36:03,914 --> 00:36:06,250
It's precisely this.

766
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:08,836
I'd like
to be larger, sir.

767
00:36:08,919 --> 00:36:09,920
Why?

768
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:11,380
Well, after all...

769
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:14,299
3 inches is
a wretched height.

770
00:36:14,383 --> 00:36:17,636
I am exactically
three inches high,

771
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:20,848
and it's a very
good height indeed!

772
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:23,892
[ Alice ]
But I'm not used to it,

773
00:36:23,934 --> 00:36:25,811
and you needn't...

774
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:26,854
shout!

775
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,316
Oh, dear.

776
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,486
I have some more
helpful hints.

777
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:36,780
One side makes
you grow taller.

778
00:36:36,864 --> 00:36:38,448
One side ofwhat?

779
00:36:38,532 --> 00:36:41,535
The other side
makes you grow shorter.

780
00:36:41,618 --> 00:36:43,787
The other side
of what?

781
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:46,039
The mushroom,
of course!

782
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:50,335
Hmm.

783
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:57,801
One side will
make me grow...

784
00:36:57,885 --> 00:36:59,845
But which is which?

785
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:02,306
Hmm.

786
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:04,808
After all that's
happened, l...

787
00:37:04,892 --> 00:37:06,810
I wonder if l...

788
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:08,353
I don't care.

789
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:12,649
I'm tired of being
3 inches high.

790
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:14,026
Yi! Yi! Yi! Yi!

791
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:15,861
Yi! Yi! Yi! Yi!

792
00:37:15,944 --> 00:37:19,156
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

793
00:37:23,577 --> 00:37:24,578
Ah!

794
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:26,455
A serpent!

795
00:37:26,497 --> 00:37:28,874
Help! Help!

796
00:37:28,957 --> 00:37:30,876
A serpent! A serpent!

797
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:32,419
Please, please!

798
00:37:32,503 --> 00:37:34,880
Off with you!
Shoo! Shoo!

799
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:36,507
Go away! Serpent!

800
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,884
But I'm not
a serpent!

801
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:40,302
Indeed?

802
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:42,346
Just what are you?

803
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:43,805
A little girl.

804
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:44,890
Little?

805
00:37:44,973 --> 00:37:46,183
Ha! Little?

806
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:47,768
Ah ha ha ha ha!

807
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:49,353
Well, I am.

808
00:37:49,436 --> 00:37:51,813
I mean, I was.

809
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:54,608
I supposeyou don't
eat eggs, either.

810
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:56,193
Yes, I do.

811
00:37:56,276 --> 00:37:58,529
I knew it!

812
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:01,532
Serpent!
Serpeeeeeeeeent!

813
00:38:01,615 --> 00:38:03,617
Oh, for goodness sake!

814
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,704
And the other side will...

815
00:38:07,788 --> 00:38:09,248
The very idea!

816
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:14,044
Spend all my time
laying eggs for
serpents like her!

817
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:15,546
Ahhhhhhhh!

818
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:20,801
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

819
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:21,885
Oh!

820
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:24,304
Goodness.

821
00:38:24,388 --> 00:38:29,393
I wonder if l'll ever
get the knack ofit.

822
00:38:34,565 --> 00:38:36,900
There. That's
much better.

823
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:40,404
Hmm. Better save these.

824
00:38:44,408 --> 00:38:45,868
Now, let's see.

825
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:47,411
Where was l?

826
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:53,876
Hmm. I wonder which way
I ought to go.

827
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:55,502
'Twas...

828
00:38:55,586 --> 00:38:59,381
Brillig and
the slithy toves

829
00:38:59,423 --> 00:39:03,510
Did gyre and
gimbel in the wabe

830
00:39:03,594 --> 00:39:05,888
All mimsy

831
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:07,890
Were the borogoves

832
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:12,311
And the momeraths
outgrabe

833
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:15,230
Now, where do you
suppose that...

834
00:39:15,272 --> 00:39:16,732
Lose something?

835
00:39:16,773 --> 00:39:18,317
Oh! Well, uh...

836
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,445
Ha ha ha.
I-l was...no...

837
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:23,530
I-l mean...
I-l was wondering...

838
00:39:23,614 --> 00:39:25,115
That's all right.

839
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:26,950
One moment, please.

840
00:39:28,035 --> 00:39:29,036
Ooh!

841
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:32,748
Second chorus.

842
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:35,083
'Twas brillig

843
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:37,085
And the slithy toves

844
00:39:37,127 --> 00:39:41,924
Did gyre and
gimbel in the wabe

845
00:39:41,965 --> 00:39:44,676
Why...why,
you're a cat.

846
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,387
A Cheshire cat.

847
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:48,722
All mimsy

848
00:39:48,805 --> 00:39:50,724
Were the borogoves

849
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:52,100
Oh, wait.

850
00:39:52,142 --> 00:39:53,727
Don't go, please!

851
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:55,103
There you are.

852
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:56,605
Third chorus.

853
00:39:56,647 --> 00:39:58,398
I wanted to ask

854
00:39:58,482 --> 00:40:01,235
which way
I ought to go.

855
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:04,071
Well, that depends...

856
00:40:04,154 --> 00:40:07,199
on where...
you want to get to.

857
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:09,827
It really doesn't
matter, as long--

858
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:12,913
Then...it really
doesn't matter...

859
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:16,250
which way...you go.

860
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:18,377
Ah hah, hah hah

861
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,296
All mimsy
were the borogoves

862
00:40:21,338 --> 00:40:23,298
And the momeraths
outgrabe

863
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:28,428
Oh, by the way...

864
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:31,306
if you'd really
like to know,

865
00:40:31,348 --> 00:40:33,642
he went...that way.

866
00:40:33,809 --> 00:40:35,435
Who did?

867
00:40:35,477 --> 00:40:36,770
The white rabbit.

868
00:40:36,812 --> 00:40:37,980
He did?

869
00:40:38,063 --> 00:40:39,147
Did what?

870
00:40:39,231 --> 00:40:40,065
Went that way?

871
00:40:40,148 --> 00:40:40,899
Who did?

872
00:40:40,983 --> 00:40:42,025
The white rabbit.

873
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:43,277
What rabbit?

874
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:45,112
Didn't you say...

875
00:40:45,154 --> 00:40:46,780
Oh, dear!

876
00:40:46,822 --> 00:40:49,658
Can you stand
on your head?

877
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:50,993
Oh!

878
00:40:51,076 --> 00:40:52,286
However...

879
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:56,123
if l were looking
for a white rabbit...

880
00:40:56,165 --> 00:40:57,291
[Clunk]

881
00:40:57,332 --> 00:40:59,960
I'd ask the Mad Hatter.

882
00:41:00,002 --> 00:41:02,212
The Mad Hatter?

883
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:03,672
No, I don't--

884
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:06,800
Or...there's
the March Hare

885
00:41:06,842 --> 00:41:09,219
in that direction.

886
00:41:09,303 --> 00:41:12,139
Thank you.
I shall visit him.

887
00:41:12,181 --> 00:41:13,682
Of course...

888
00:41:13,765 --> 00:41:15,434
he's mad, too.

889
00:41:15,517 --> 00:41:18,228
I don't want to
be with mad people.

890
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:20,981
Oh, you can't
help that.

891
00:41:21,023 --> 00:41:23,233
Most everyone's
mad here.

892
00:41:23,317 --> 00:41:26,320
Ha ha ha ha ha!

893
00:41:27,488 --> 00:41:30,407
You may
have noticed

894
00:41:30,491 --> 00:41:34,995
that I'm not
all there myself.

895
00:41:38,165 --> 00:41:42,336
And the momeraths
outgrabe...

896
00:41:42,377 --> 00:41:44,546
Goodness. If people
here are like that,

897
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:48,550
I must try not
to upset them.

898
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,763
How very curious.

899
00:41:52,846 --> 00:41:54,681
lfthere are
no objections

900
00:41:54,723 --> 00:41:56,558
Let it be unanimous

901
00:41:56,642 --> 00:41:58,352
Oh, a very
merry unbirthday

902
00:41:58,393 --> 00:42:00,562
A very merry
unbirthday

903
00:42:00,646 --> 00:42:03,899
A very merry
unbirthday to us

904
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,835
A

905
00:42:22,918 --> 00:42:25,003
Very merry
unbirthday to me

906
00:42:25,087 --> 00:42:25,921
To who

907
00:42:26,004 --> 00:42:27,256
Oh, you

908
00:42:27,297 --> 00:42:28,757
A very merry
unbirthday to you

909
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:29,758
Who, me

910
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:31,009
Oh, me

911
00:42:31,093 --> 00:42:32,177
Let's all
congratulate us

912
00:42:32,261 --> 00:42:33,679
With another
cup of tea

913
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:36,598
A very merry
unbirthday

914
00:42:36,682 --> 00:42:40,519
To...

915
00:42:40,602 --> 00:42:42,062
You

916
00:42:42,104 --> 00:42:44,940
[Clap clap clap]

917
00:42:45,023 --> 00:42:46,525
No room!
No room!

918
00:42:46,608 --> 00:42:48,610
No room!
No room!

919
00:42:48,694 --> 00:42:51,446
But there's
plenty of room.

920
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:54,950
It's rude to sit
without being invited.

921
00:42:55,033 --> 00:42:58,579
It's very, very
rude, indeed!

922
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:01,415
Very, very, very
rude, indeed.

923
00:43:01,456 --> 00:43:02,958
I'm very sorry.

924
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:05,961
But I did enjoy
your singing.

925
00:43:06,044 --> 00:43:08,172
You enjoyed
our singing?

926
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:10,799
Oh, what
a delightful child!

927
00:43:10,883 --> 00:43:11,800
I'm so excited.

928
00:43:11,884 --> 00:43:13,635
We never get
compliments.

929
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:16,638
You must have
a cup of tea!

930
00:43:16,722 --> 00:43:18,265
Ah, yes, indeed.

931
00:43:18,307 --> 00:43:21,768
You must have
a cup of tea.

932
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:25,272
I'm sorry I interrupted
your birthday party.

933
00:43:25,314 --> 00:43:26,773
Birthday?

934
00:43:26,815 --> 00:43:29,610
This is not
a birthday party!

935
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:31,153
Of course not.

936
00:43:32,488 --> 00:43:35,365
This is
an unbirthday party.

937
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:36,950
Unbirthday?

938
00:43:36,992 --> 00:43:39,453
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

939
00:43:39,495 --> 00:43:40,954
It's very simple.

940
00:43:40,996 --> 00:43:42,956
30 days have Sept--

941
00:43:42,998 --> 00:43:44,458
No. An unbirthday...

942
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,461
if you have
a birthday, then...

943
00:43:47,503 --> 00:43:48,962
you...

944
00:43:49,004 --> 00:43:52,174
She doesn't know
what an unbirthday is.

945
00:43:52,257 --> 00:43:55,802
How silly!
Ha ha ha ha!

946
00:43:55,844 --> 00:43:57,346
Well, l...

947
00:43:59,515 --> 00:44:01,975
I shall elucidate.

948
00:44:08,148 --> 00:44:09,650
Now statistics prove

949
00:44:09,691 --> 00:44:11,985
Prove that you've
one birthday

950
00:44:12,027 --> 00:44:14,530
lmagine just one
birthday every year

951
00:44:14,613 --> 00:44:19,451
Ah, but there are
364 unbirthdays

952
00:44:19,535 --> 00:44:22,162
Precisely why
we're gathered here to cheer

953
00:44:22,204 --> 00:44:24,873
Then today's
my unbirthday, too.

954
00:44:24,957 --> 00:44:26,083
It is?

955
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:28,377
What a small world.

956
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,963
In that case...

957
00:44:31,046 --> 00:44:32,881
A very merry unbirthday

958
00:44:32,965 --> 00:44:34,299
To me

959
00:44:34,383 --> 00:44:35,634
Toyou

960
00:44:35,717 --> 00:44:37,219
A very merry unbirthday

961
00:44:37,302 --> 00:44:38,220
For me

962
00:44:38,303 --> 00:44:39,346
Foryou

963
00:44:39,388 --> 00:44:41,306
Blow
the candle out

964
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:43,642
And make your
wish come true

965
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:50,732
A very merry
unbirthday

966
00:44:50,816 --> 00:44:53,026
Toyou

967
00:44:54,736 --> 00:44:57,906
Twinkle, twinkle
little bat.

968
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:00,909
How I wonder
whatyou're at.

969
00:45:00,993 --> 00:45:03,579
Up above
the world you fly,

970
00:45:03,662 --> 00:45:06,540
Like a tea-tray
in the sky.

971
00:45:06,582 --> 00:45:08,917
That was lovely.

972
00:45:09,001 --> 00:45:11,128
And now, my dear,

973
00:45:11,211 --> 00:45:14,840
you were saying
you were seeking...

974
00:45:14,923 --> 00:45:16,383
Pardon me.

975
00:45:16,425 --> 00:45:20,596
You were seeking
some information of some kind?

976
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:22,848
Yes. I'm looking
for--

977
00:45:22,931 --> 00:45:24,850
Clean cup!
Clean cup!

978
00:45:24,933 --> 00:45:26,393
Move down!

979
00:45:26,435 --> 00:45:28,562
But I haven't
used my cup.

980
00:45:28,604 --> 00:45:31,231
Clean cup,
move down

981
00:45:31,273 --> 00:45:33,984
Would you like
more tea?

982
00:45:34,067 --> 00:45:36,403
I haven't
had any yet,

983
00:45:36,445 --> 00:45:38,864
So I can't take more.

984
00:45:38,947 --> 00:45:41,325
You mean you
can't take less.

985
00:45:41,408 --> 00:45:44,578
You can always take
more than nothing.

986
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,455
But--

987
00:45:46,538 --> 00:45:48,415
And now, my dear,

988
00:45:48,457 --> 00:45:51,418
Something seems
to be troubling you.

989
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,171
Tell us
all about it.

990
00:45:54,254 --> 00:45:56,048
Start at
the beginning.

991
00:45:56,131 --> 00:45:57,382
Yes, yes.

992
00:45:57,466 --> 00:46:00,761
And when you
come to the end...

993
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:02,304
stop!

994
00:46:02,387 --> 00:46:05,432
It started while
I was sitting

995
00:46:05,474 --> 00:46:07,684
on the riverbank
with Dinah.

996
00:46:07,768 --> 00:46:09,394
Very interesting.

997
00:46:09,478 --> 00:46:11,396
Who's Dinah?

998
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,565
Dinah's my cat.

999
00:46:13,649 --> 00:46:14,608
Cat?

1000
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:16,276
Cat!

1001
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,695
What's got
into him?

1002
00:46:18,779 --> 00:46:19,863
Catch him!

1003
00:46:19,947 --> 00:46:22,282
Help! Help!
Stop him!

1004
00:46:22,324 --> 00:46:23,826
Get thejam!

1005
00:46:23,909 --> 00:46:25,702
Put it
on his nose!

1006
00:46:25,786 --> 00:46:27,496
C-c-cat...

1007
00:46:27,579 --> 00:46:28,580
Ohh...

1008
00:46:28,664 --> 00:46:30,165
Oh, my goodness.

1009
00:46:30,249 --> 00:46:34,294
Those are the things
that upset me.

1010
00:46:34,336 --> 00:46:37,005
See the trouble
you've started?

1011
00:46:37,089 --> 00:46:38,549
I didn't think--

1012
00:46:38,632 --> 00:46:41,844
If you don't think,
you shouldn't talk.

1013
00:46:41,927 --> 00:46:43,887
Clean cup,
move down!

1014
00:46:43,971 --> 00:46:45,013
But--

1015
00:46:45,097 --> 00:46:46,139
Move down,
move down

1016
00:46:46,181 --> 00:46:48,183
Move down

1017
00:46:48,267 --> 00:46:50,811
Now, dear,
you were saying?

1018
00:46:50,853 --> 00:46:52,229
Oh, yes.

1019
00:46:52,312 --> 00:46:55,065
I was sitting
on the riverbank,

1020
00:46:55,149 --> 00:46:57,442
with, uh...
you know who.

1021
00:46:57,526 --> 00:46:59,444
I do?

1022
00:46:59,528 --> 00:47:03,365
I mean my c-a-t.

1023
00:47:03,448 --> 00:47:04,658
Tea!

1024
00:47:05,993 --> 00:47:08,871
Just a half
a cup.

1025
00:47:08,954 --> 00:47:10,455
Come, come, my dear,

1026
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:13,667
don't you care
for tea?

1027
00:47:13,709 --> 00:47:15,836
I'm very fond
of tea.

1028
00:47:15,878 --> 00:47:19,381
You could
at least make polite conversation.

1029
00:47:19,464 --> 00:47:21,216
I've been
trying to ask--

1030
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,011
I have an
excellent idea.

1031
00:47:24,052 --> 00:47:26,263
Let's change
the subject.

1032
00:47:27,556 --> 00:47:31,268
Why is a raven
like a writing desk?

1033
00:47:31,351 --> 00:47:32,686
Riddles?

1034
00:47:32,728 --> 00:47:34,688
Let me see, now.

1035
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:37,691
Why is a raven

1036
00:47:37,733 --> 00:47:39,693
Iike
a writing desk?

1037
00:47:39,735 --> 00:47:41,278
I beg your pardon?

1038
00:47:41,361 --> 00:47:44,448
Why is a raven
like a writing desk?

1039
00:47:44,531 --> 00:47:45,782
What?

1040
00:47:45,866 --> 00:47:47,242
Careful.
She's mad.

1041
00:47:47,326 --> 00:47:49,620
It's your
silly riddle.

1042
00:47:49,703 --> 00:47:51,079
You just said--

1043
00:47:51,205 --> 00:47:52,414
Don't get excited.

1044
00:47:52,456 --> 00:47:53,707
A cup of tea?

1045
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:56,919
A cup of tea,
indeed!

1046
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,462
I haven't time.

1047
00:47:58,712 --> 00:48:01,423
The time!
Who's got the time?

1048
00:48:01,507 --> 00:48:03,926
No time,
no time, no time.

1049
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:06,094
Hello. Good-bye.
I'm late! I'm late!

1050
00:48:06,136 --> 00:48:07,596
The white rabbit!

1051
00:48:07,638 --> 00:48:10,307
I'm so late.
I'm so very late.

1052
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:12,434
No wonder you're late.

1053
00:48:12,476 --> 00:48:15,646
This clock is exactly
two days slow.

1054
00:48:15,729 --> 00:48:17,147
Two days slow?

1055
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:18,649
Of course you're late.

1056
00:48:18,732 --> 00:48:20,150
My goodness.

1057
00:48:20,234 --> 00:48:22,611
We'll have
to look into this.

1058
00:48:22,653 --> 00:48:24,404
A-ha!

1059
00:48:24,488 --> 00:48:26,323
I see what's wrong.

1060
00:48:26,406 --> 00:48:29,159
This watch
is full of wheels.

1061
00:48:29,243 --> 00:48:30,911
Oh, my poor watch.

1062
00:48:30,994 --> 00:48:33,330
Oh, my wheels
and springs.

1063
00:48:33,413 --> 00:48:35,165
But-but-but-but...

1064
00:48:35,249 --> 00:48:36,917
Butter! Of course!

1065
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,836
It needs butter.
Butter!

1066
00:48:38,919 --> 00:48:40,587
Butter!

1067
00:48:40,671 --> 00:48:41,922
But-butter?

1068
00:48:42,005 --> 00:48:43,841
Butter.
Thank you. Butter.

1069
00:48:43,924 --> 00:48:45,759
That's fine.

1070
00:48:45,843 --> 00:48:47,010
No, no, no.

1071
00:48:47,094 --> 00:48:49,346
You'll get
crumbs in it!

1072
00:48:49,429 --> 00:48:51,265
This is good butter.

1073
00:48:51,348 --> 00:48:52,432
Tea?

1074
00:48:52,516 --> 00:48:55,269
I never
thought of tea.

1075
00:48:55,352 --> 00:48:56,687
No! Not tea!

1076
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:57,855
Sugar?

1077
00:48:57,938 --> 00:48:59,439
Sugar. Two spoons.

1078
00:48:59,523 --> 00:49:01,191
Two spoons.
Thank you.

1079
00:49:01,275 --> 00:49:02,693
Be careful!

1080
00:49:02,776 --> 00:49:06,780
Jam! I forgot
all about jam.

1081
00:49:06,864 --> 00:49:07,823
Mustard!

1082
00:49:07,865 --> 00:49:09,324
Mustard, yes.

1083
00:49:09,366 --> 00:49:11,368
Mustard?

1084
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:13,704
Don't let's
be silly.

1085
00:49:13,787 --> 00:49:15,998
Lemon.
That's different.

1086
00:49:17,124 --> 00:49:19,042
That should do it.

1087
00:49:19,126 --> 00:49:20,794
[Ring]

1088
00:49:22,045 --> 00:49:23,005
Look at that!

1089
00:49:23,046 --> 00:49:24,047
Goodness.

1090
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:25,048
Dear.

1091
00:49:27,384 --> 00:49:29,011
Mad watch.

1092
00:49:29,052 --> 00:49:30,387
Mad watch!

1093
00:49:32,389 --> 00:49:36,685
There's only one way
to stop a mad watch.

1094
00:49:36,727 --> 00:49:40,230
Two days slow,
that's what it is.

1095
00:49:40,314 --> 00:49:43,066
Oh, my watch.

1096
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:44,193
It was?

1097
00:49:44,234 --> 00:49:46,987
It was an
unbirthday present.

1098
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:48,155
In that case...

1099
00:49:48,238 --> 00:49:50,741
A very merry unbirthday

1100
00:49:50,824 --> 00:49:53,994
To

1101
00:49:54,077 --> 00:49:55,496
You

1102
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:56,497
Mr. Rabbit!

1103
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,415
Oh, Mr. Rabbit!

1104
00:49:58,499 --> 00:50:00,918
Now where did he go?

1105
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:03,003
...to us,
to us

1106
00:50:03,086 --> 00:50:04,254
A very merry
unbirthday

1107
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:06,882
To us, to us

1108
00:50:06,924 --> 00:50:09,593
Of all the silly nonsense.

1109
00:50:09,676 --> 00:50:13,680
This is the stupidest
tea party ever.

1110
00:50:18,185 --> 00:50:20,270
I've had
enough nonsense.

1111
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:22,105
I'm going home.

1112
00:50:22,189 --> 00:50:23,774
Straight home.

1113
00:50:24,942 --> 00:50:26,443
That rabbit.

1114
00:50:26,527 --> 00:50:29,446
Who cares where
he's going anyway?

1115
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:32,741
Ifit hadn't
been for him, l--

1116
00:50:32,783 --> 00:50:35,285
"TulgeyWood."

1117
00:50:37,037 --> 00:50:38,914
Hmm. Curious.

1158
00:54:14,922 --> 00:54:17,841
I suppose
it's good advice

1159
00:54:17,925 --> 00:54:20,344
to stay
where you are

1160

finds you.

to look for me here?

If l'd listened
earlier,

1164
00:54:34,942 --> 00:54:36,360
I wouldn't be here.

1165
00:54:36,443 --> 00:54:40,364
But that's just
the trouble with me.

1166

I give myself
very good advice...

1167
00:54:44,785 --> 00:54:48,789
But I very seldom
follow it

1168
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:53,377

a price to pay

01:01:34,486 --> 01:01:36,405
Yea!
Yea!
Hooray!

1301
01:01:36,488 --> 01:01:38,740
They're going
to lose their heads

1302
01:01:38,824 --> 01:01:40,909
For painting
the roses red

1303
01:01:40,993 --> 01:01:42,494
It serves them right,
they planted white

1304
01:01:42,578 --> 01:01:43,954
And roses
should be red

1305
01:01:44,037 --> 01:01:46,874
Oh, they're going
to lose their heads

1306
01:01:46,915 --> 01:01:49,334
Silence!

1307
01:01:49,418 --> 01:01:52,296
Oh, please, please.
They were only--

1308
01:01:52,379 --> 01:01:53,630
And who is this?

1309
01:01:53,714 --> 01:01:56,758
Let me see, my dear.

1310
01:01:56,842 --> 01:01:58,218
It isn't a heart.

1311
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:00,137
Is it a club?

1312
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:02,931
It's a little girl.

1313
01:02:03,015 --> 01:02:05,267
Yes, and
I was hoping--

1314
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:06,810
Look up.
Speak nicely.

1315
01:02:06,894 --> 01:02:09,605
And don't twiddle
your fingers!

1316
01:02:09,688 --> 01:02:11,607
Turn out your toes.

1317
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:13,484
Curtsy.

1318
01:02:13,567 --> 01:02:16,904
Open your mouth wider,
and always say,

1319
01:02:16,945 --> 01:02:20,240
"Yes, Your Majesty!"

1320
01:02:21,283 --> 01:02:24,578
Yes, Your Majesty!

1321
01:02:25,954 --> 01:02:28,916
Now, where
do you come from?

1322
01:02:28,957 --> 01:02:31,084
Where are you going?

1323
01:02:31,126 --> 01:02:32,920
I've lost my way.

1324
01:02:32,961 --> 01:02:34,296
Your way?

1325
01:02:34,379 --> 01:02:37,633
All ways here
are my ways!

1326
01:02:37,716 --> 01:02:40,594
Yes, I know.
I was thinking--

1327
01:02:40,636 --> 01:02:42,596
Curtsy while
you're thinking.

1328
01:02:42,638 --> 01:02:44,306
It saves time.

1329
01:02:44,389 --> 01:02:47,267
Yes, but I
wanted to ask--

1330
01:02:48,477 --> 01:02:49,561
I'll ask
the questions!

1331
01:02:49,645 --> 01:02:51,563
Do you
play croquet?

1332
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:53,565
Why, yes,
Your Majesty.

1333
01:02:53,649 --> 01:02:56,610
Then let
the game begin!

1334
01:02:56,652 --> 01:02:59,279
[Fanfare]

1335
01:02:59,321 --> 01:03:01,949
To your places.
Hurry, hurry!

1336
01:03:03,158 --> 01:03:04,660
Shuffle deck!

1337
01:03:06,161 --> 01:03:08,288
Cards, cut!

1338
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:09,832
Deal cards!

1339
01:03:10,833 --> 01:03:13,710
Cards, halt!

1340
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:15,921
[Squawk squawk]

1341
01:03:25,472 --> 01:03:27,099
[Squawk squawk]

1342
01:03:42,531 --> 01:03:44,658
[Squawk squawk]

1343
01:03:44,741 --> 01:03:47,619
Silence!

1344
01:04:16,773 --> 01:04:18,317
Yea!
Yea!

1345
01:04:50,432 --> 01:04:52,559
Off with his head!

1346
01:04:52,643 --> 01:04:54,436
Off with his head.

1347
01:04:54,478 --> 01:04:57,022
You heard
what she said.

1348
01:04:57,105 --> 01:04:58,357
You're next,

1349
01:04:58,440 --> 01:04:59,983
my dear.

1350
01:05:01,318 --> 01:05:02,820
Yes, Your Majesty.

1351
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:24,508
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

1352
01:05:24,591 --> 01:05:26,093
Ohh.

1353
01:05:29,805 --> 01:05:31,140
Stop!

1354
01:05:31,181 --> 01:05:33,142
Of all the
impossible...

1355
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:36,645
You want us both
to lose our heads?

1356
01:05:36,687 --> 01:05:38,397
Well, I don't.

1357
01:05:41,859 --> 01:05:43,360
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

1358
01:05:49,324 --> 01:05:50,367
Huh?

1359
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:51,451
Ow!

1360
01:06:07,342 --> 01:06:09,595
La la la
da da dum

1361
01:06:09,678 --> 01:06:11,430
La la la hmm

1362
01:06:11,513 --> 01:06:13,724
How are
you getting on?

1363
01:06:13,807 --> 01:06:15,601
Not at all.

1364
01:06:15,684 --> 01:06:17,144
Beg pardon?

1365
01:06:17,227 --> 01:06:19,229
I said, not at all.

1366
01:06:19,313 --> 01:06:21,690
Who are you
talking to?

1367
01:06:21,732 --> 01:06:24,067
A cat, Your Majesty.

1368
01:06:24,151 --> 01:06:25,319
Where?

1369
01:06:25,402 --> 01:06:26,403
There!

1370
01:06:26,487 --> 01:06:27,446
Oh.

1371
01:06:27,529 --> 01:06:28,947
There he is!

1372
01:06:29,031 --> 01:06:31,158
I warn you, child.

1373
01:06:31,241 --> 01:06:36,830
If l lose my temper,
you lose your head!

1374
01:06:36,914 --> 01:06:39,500
We could make her
really angry.

1375
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:41,168
Shall we try?

1376
01:06:41,251 --> 01:06:43,545
Oh, no, no!

1377
01:06:43,587 --> 01:06:45,631
It's loads of fun.

1378
01:06:45,714 --> 01:06:47,090
No, no, stop!

1379
01:06:49,051 --> 01:06:50,928
Oh, no!

1380
01:06:51,011 --> 01:06:53,138
My fur and whiskers!

1381
01:06:53,222 --> 01:06:55,599
Oh, dear!
Save the queen!

1382
01:06:55,682 --> 01:06:59,394
Someone's head
will roll for this!

1383
01:06:59,478 --> 01:07:01,772
Yours!

1384
01:07:02,898 --> 01:07:04,858
Off with her--

1385
01:07:04,942 --> 01:07:07,402
Couldn't she
have a trial?

1386
01:07:07,444 --> 01:07:08,529
Huh?

1387
01:07:08,612 --> 01:07:09,696
First?

1388
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:11,240
Trial?

1389
01:07:11,281 --> 01:07:13,659
Well, just
a little trial?

1390
01:07:13,742 --> 01:07:15,661
Hmm?

1391
01:07:15,744 --> 01:07:17,579
Hmm...

1392
01:07:17,746 --> 01:07:19,748
Very well then.

1393
01:07:19,832 --> 01:07:22,251
Let the trial begin!

1394
01:07:24,711 --> 01:07:26,171
[Fanfare]

1395
01:07:30,008 --> 01:07:31,468
Your Majesty...

1396
01:07:32,886 --> 01:07:35,180
members of the jury,

1397
01:07:35,264 --> 01:07:37,099
Ioyal subjects...

1398
01:07:37,141 --> 01:07:38,517
A-hem.

1399
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,019
and the king.

1400
01:07:41,103 --> 01:07:45,232
The prisoner is charged
with enticing Her Majesty

1401
01:07:45,315 --> 01:07:47,651
into a game of croquet,

1402
01:07:47,734 --> 01:07:50,154
and there by will fully
teasing, tormenting,

1403
01:07:50,237 --> 01:07:52,114
and annoying
our beloved--

1404
01:07:52,197 --> 01:07:53,657
Never mind that!

1405
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:57,619
Get to where
I lose my temper.

1406
01:07:57,661 --> 01:08:00,539
... there by causing the
queen to lose her temper.

1407
01:08:00,622 --> 01:08:05,669
Now, are you ready
for your sentence?

1408
01:08:05,752 --> 01:08:08,797
There must
be a verdict first.

1409
01:08:08,881 --> 01:08:10,549
Sentence first!

1410
01:08:10,632 --> 01:08:11,967
Verdict afterward.

1411
01:08:12,009 --> 01:08:13,468
But that way isn't--

1412
01:08:13,552 --> 01:08:15,304
All ways are...

1413
01:08:15,345 --> 01:08:18,056
Your ways,
Your Majesty.

1414
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:20,601
Yes, my child.

1415
01:08:20,684 --> 01:08:22,144
Off with her--

1416
01:08:22,186 --> 01:08:24,480
Consider, we've
called no witnesses.

1417
01:08:24,563 --> 01:08:27,816
Couldn't we hear
one or two? Huh?

1418
01:08:27,858 --> 01:08:29,651
Oh, very well,

1419
01:08:29,693 --> 01:08:32,154
but get on with it!

1420
01:08:32,196 --> 01:08:35,032
First witness.
Call the first witness.

1421
01:08:35,115 --> 01:08:36,575
The March Hare.

1422
01:08:41,205 --> 01:08:43,665
What do you
know about this?

1423
01:08:43,707 --> 01:08:45,000
Nothing.

1424
01:08:45,042 --> 01:08:46,585
Nothing whatever?

1425
01:08:46,668 --> 01:08:48,003
Nothing
whatever!

1426
01:08:48,045 --> 01:08:50,839
That's very important!

1427
01:08:50,881 --> 01:08:52,424
Jury, write that down.

1428
01:08:56,553 --> 01:08:59,097
" Unimportant,"
Your Majesty means.

1429
01:08:59,181 --> 01:09:01,433
Silence!

1430
01:09:01,517 --> 01:09:02,893
Next witness.

1431
01:09:02,976 --> 01:09:04,520
The dormouse.

1432
01:09:08,524 --> 01:09:09,691
Well--

1433
01:09:09,775 --> 01:09:11,235
Shh!

1434
01:09:11,318 --> 01:09:14,112
What have
you to say?

1435
01:09:14,196 --> 01:09:17,324
Twinkle, twinkle,
little bat.

1436
01:09:17,407 --> 01:09:19,451
How I wonder...

1437
01:09:19,535 --> 01:09:22,746
That's the most important
evidence we've heard yet.

1438
01:09:22,830 --> 01:09:24,873
Write that down!

1439
01:09:24,957 --> 01:09:26,375
Twinkle, twinkle.

1440
01:09:26,458 --> 01:09:28,210
Twinkle, twinkle.

1441
01:09:28,252 --> 01:09:29,711
Twinkle, twinkle.

1442
01:09:29,753 --> 01:09:31,213
What next?

1443
01:09:31,296 --> 01:09:32,756
The Mad Hatter.

1444
01:09:36,635 --> 01:09:38,387
Oh!

1445
01:09:38,428 --> 01:09:40,389
Off with your hat!

1446
01:09:40,472 --> 01:09:42,391
Oh, my.

1447
01:09:42,474 --> 01:09:45,018
Where were you
when this happened?

1448
01:09:45,102 --> 01:09:47,729
I was home
drinking tea.

1449
01:09:47,813 --> 01:09:50,065
Today is
my unbirthday.

1450
01:09:50,107 --> 01:09:53,402
Why, today is
your unbirthday, too.

1451
01:09:53,485 --> 01:09:54,444
It is?

1452
01:09:54,528 --> 01:09:55,737
It is?

1453
01:09:55,821 --> 01:09:57,364
It is?

1454
01:09:57,447 --> 01:10:00,033
A very merry
unbirthday

1455
01:10:00,117 --> 01:10:01,076
To me?

1456
01:10:01,118 --> 01:10:02,244
Oh, no.

1457
01:10:02,327 --> 01:10:03,871
A very merry
unbirthday

1458
01:10:03,954 --> 01:10:04,913
For me?

1459
01:10:04,997 --> 01:10:06,415
For you

1460
01:10:06,456 --> 01:10:08,041
Now blow the candle
out, my dear

1461
01:10:08,125 --> 01:10:09,710
And make
your wish come true

1462
01:10:12,754 --> 01:10:16,258
A very merry
unbirthday

1463
01:10:16,341 --> 01:10:19,636
To you

1464
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:21,597
Oh! Your Majesty.

1465
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:24,433
Yes, my dear?

1466
01:10:24,475 --> 01:10:26,477
There he is now.

1467
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,145
Huh? What? Who?

1468
01:10:28,228 --> 01:10:29,438
The Cheshire cat.

1469
01:10:29,521 --> 01:10:30,689
Cat!

1470
01:10:30,772 --> 01:10:31,899
Cat!

1471
01:10:31,982 --> 01:10:33,275
Cat!

1472
01:10:33,317 --> 01:10:35,777
Oh, this
is terrible.

1473
01:10:35,861 --> 01:10:37,362
Stop him!

1474
01:10:37,446 --> 01:10:39,448
Somebody help me!
Catch him!

1475
01:10:39,531 --> 01:10:41,325
The jam!

1476
01:10:41,408 --> 01:10:44,995
The jam!
By order of the king!

1477
01:10:45,078 --> 01:10:47,289
Let me have it!

1478
01:10:51,043 --> 01:10:56,340
Somebody's head is
going to roll for this!

1479
01:10:56,423 --> 01:10:58,091
A-ha!

1480
01:10:58,175 --> 01:11:00,552
The mushroom.

1481
01:11:00,636 --> 01:11:02,095
Off with her--

1482
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:10,813
Pooh. I'm not
afraid of you.

1483
01:11:10,854 --> 01:11:14,566
You're nothing but
a pack of cards.

1484
01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:18,153
Rule 42--persons
more than a mile high

1485
01:11:18,237 --> 01:11:20,989
must leave
the court immediately.

1486
01:11:21,073 --> 01:11:24,201
I'm not a mile high.
I'm not leaving.

1487
01:11:24,368 --> 01:11:27,204
Sorry. Rule 42,
you know.

1488
01:11:27,287 --> 01:11:32,000
And as for you,
Your Majesty.

1489
01:11:32,042 --> 01:11:33,794
Your Majesty,
indeed.

1490
01:11:33,877 --> 01:11:36,296
Why, you're
not a queen.

1491
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:38,715
You're just
a fat, pompous,

1492
01:11:38,799 --> 01:11:41,176
bad-tempered
old ty--

1493
01:11:41,218 --> 01:11:42,469
tyrant.

1494
01:11:44,805 --> 01:11:48,809
And, uh, what were
you saying, my dear?

1495
01:11:48,892 --> 01:11:52,312
She simply said
you're a fat, pompous,

1496
01:11:52,396 --> 01:11:53,730
bad-tempered
old tyrant!

1497
01:11:53,814 --> 01:11:57,025
Off with her head!

1498
01:12:02,447 --> 01:12:05,242
You heard what
Her Majesty said!

1499
01:12:05,325 --> 01:12:07,161
Off with her head!

1500
01:12:07,244 --> 01:12:08,162
[Fanfare]

1501
01:12:30,267 --> 01:12:31,768
Forward, backward,
inward, outward

1502
01:12:31,852 --> 01:12:33,020
Here we go again

1503
01:12:33,103 --> 01:12:34,229
No one ever loses

1504
01:12:34,313 --> 01:12:35,606
And no one
can ever win

1505
01:12:35,689 --> 01:12:36,940
Backward, forward,
outward, inward

1506
01:12:37,024 --> 01:12:39,026
Bottom to the top...

1507
01:12:39,109 --> 01:12:41,445
[ The queen ]
Off with her head!

1508
01:12:42,946 --> 01:12:46,116
You can't leave
without having some tea.

1509
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,368
I can't stop now.

1510
01:12:48,452 --> 01:12:52,080
You must join us
in a cup of tea.

1511
01:12:55,459 --> 01:12:58,128
Off with her head!

1512
01:12:58,212 --> 01:13:00,714
Mr. Caterpillar,
what will I do?

1513
01:13:00,797 --> 01:13:03,550
Who are you?

1514
01:13:03,634 --> 01:13:05,761
[Cough cough]

1515
01:13:05,844 --> 01:13:07,262
There she goes!

1516
01:13:07,346 --> 01:13:09,765
Don't let
her get away!

1517
01:13:09,807 --> 01:13:11,809
Off with her head!

1518
01:13:16,563 --> 01:13:17,815
Ohh!

1519
01:13:17,898 --> 01:13:19,775
Still locked,
you know.

1520
01:13:19,858 --> 01:13:22,736
The queen.
I must get out.

1521
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:24,112
But you are outside.

1522
01:13:24,154 --> 01:13:25,447
What?

1523
01:13:25,489 --> 01:13:27,407
See for yourself.

1524
01:13:27,491 --> 01:13:29,952
Why...
why, that's me!

1525
01:13:29,993 --> 01:13:31,411
I'm asleep.

1526
01:13:31,495 --> 01:13:33,997
Don't let her
get away!

1527
01:13:34,081 --> 01:13:35,916
Off with her head!

1528
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:37,417
Alice, wake up.

1529
01:13:37,501 --> 01:13:38,627
Alice!

1530
01:13:39,753 --> 01:13:41,755
Please
wake up, Alice.

1531
01:13:41,839 --> 01:13:43,257
Alice! Alice!

1532
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:44,758
Alice!

1533
01:13:44,842 --> 01:13:46,260
Alice! Alice!

1534
01:13:46,343 --> 01:13:49,596
Will you pay attention
and recite your lesson?

1535
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,765
Hmm? Oh.

1536
01:13:51,849 --> 01:13:54,101
How doth
the little crocodile

1537
01:13:54,184 --> 01:13:55,435
improve
his shining tail

1538
01:13:55,519 --> 01:13:57,271
and pour
the waters of--

1539
01:13:57,354 --> 01:14:00,274
Alice, what are
you talking about?

1540
01:14:00,357 --> 01:14:01,775
Oh, I'm sorry.

1541
01:14:01,859 --> 01:14:04,278
You see,
the caterpillar said--

1542
01:14:04,361 --> 01:14:07,281
Caterpillar?
Oh, for goodness sake.

1543
01:14:07,364 --> 01:14:08,782
Alice, l--

1544
01:14:08,866 --> 01:14:10,784
Oh, well.
Come along.

1545
01:14:10,868 --> 01:14:12,786
It's time for tea.

1546
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:14,830
[Chorus]
Alice

1547
01:14:14,872 --> 01:14:18,125
In wonderland

1548
01:14:18,208 --> 01:14:19,793
Over the hill

1549
01:14:19,877 --> 01:14:24,214
Or here or there

1550
01:14:24,298 --> 01:14:30,846
I wonder where

1551
01:14:42,274 --> 01:14:44,026
Alice

1552
01:14:44,109 --> 01:14:47,613
In Wonderland

1553
01:14:47,696 --> 01:14:51,742
How do you get
to Wonderland?

1554
01:14:51,825 --> 01:14:55,704
Over the hill
or underland

1555
01:14:55,787 --> 01:15:00,667
Or just behind the tree?

1556
01:15:00,709 --> 01:15:02,419
Alice

1557
01:15:02,503 --> 01:15:05,672
In Wonderland

1558
01:15:05,756 --> 01:15:10,886
Where is the path
to Wonderland?

1559
01:15:10,969 --> 01:15:12,971
Over the hill

1560
01:15:13,055 --> 01:15:16,683
Or here or there?

1561
01:15:16,767 --> 01:15:21,980
I wonder where
