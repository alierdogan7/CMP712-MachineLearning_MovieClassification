(military drum beat)

18
00:02:04,316 --> 00:02:06,355
Good morning, Miss Prescott.

19
00:02:08,945 --> 00:02:10,937
Good morning, Miss Prescott.

20
00:02:19,746 --> 00:02:21,988
(Miss Prescott) Now hear this!

21
00:02:39,138 --> 00:02:42,554
I simpIy cannot release this issue
the way it is!

22
00:02:42,683 --> 00:02:47,345
In the 60 years of Quality
magazine, this hits rock bottom.

23
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:51,263
If I let this go through, I will have
failed the American woman.

24
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:53,308
(all) No, Miss Prescott,
don't say that!

25
00:02:53,443 --> 00:02:56,562
The great American woman,
who stands out there naked,

26
00:02:56,696 --> 00:02:59,815
waiting for me
to tell her what to wear.

27
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:02,071
It doesn't speak.

28
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:05,700
And if it won't speak to me,
it won't speak to anyone.

29
00:03:06,788 --> 00:03:10,038
A magazine
must be like a human being.

30
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,871
If it comes into the home
it must contribute.

31
00:03:13,002 --> 00:03:16,121
It just can't lie around.

32
00:03:16,255 --> 00:03:18,461
A magazine must have...

33
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:22,384
..blood and brains and pizzazz.

34
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,004
This is just paper!

35
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:27,552
If I send paper to the American
woman, I will have let her down.

36
00:03:27,682 --> 00:03:29,923
(all) No, Miss Prescott,
you mustn't say that.

37
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:32,098
Yes. D for down.

38
00:03:32,227 --> 00:03:33,721
D for dreary.

39
00:03:33,854 --> 00:03:38,232
D for dull and for depressing,

40
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:40,185
dismal and deadly!

41
00:03:43,697 --> 00:03:46,448
Ahh! Here it is!

42
00:03:46,575 --> 00:03:49,575
Here is our theme.
Here is our answer. Pink!

43
00:03:49,702 --> 00:03:51,529
(excited chatter)

44
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:59,826
Girls, girls, girls, girls.
Listen, take this to all the designers.

45
00:03:59,961 --> 00:04:02,250
I want dresses made up in
exactly this shade of pink.

46
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,254
Babs, take this to Kaiser Delmont.

47
00:04:04,382 --> 00:04:06,707
I want shoes and stockings
in exactly this colour.

48
00:04:06,843 --> 00:04:09,416
Laura, everything goes pink!

49
00:04:09,553 --> 00:04:12,720
I want the whole issue pink.
I want the whole country pink!

50
00:04:12,848 --> 00:04:17,059
Lettie, take an editorial.
"To the women of America..."

51
00:04:17,185 --> 00:04:19,854
No, make it
"To the women everywhere."

52
00:04:20,188 --> 00:04:21,765
Banish the black,

53
00:04:21,898 --> 00:04:23,440
burn the blue,

54
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:25,642
and bury the beige.

55
00:04:25,776 --> 00:04:27,650
From now on, girls...

56
00:04:29,571 --> 00:04:33,189
♫ Think pink! Think pink
when you shop for summer clothes

57
00:04:33,325 --> 00:04:37,369
♫ Think pink! Think pink
if you want that quelque chose

58
00:04:37,495 --> 00:04:39,286
♫ Red is dead, blue is through

59
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:41,205
♫ Green's obscene, brown's taboo

60
00:04:41,332 --> 00:04:45,246
♫ And there is not the slightest
excuse for plum or puce

61
00:04:45,377 --> 00:04:46,919
♫ Or chartreuse

62
00:04:47,045 --> 00:04:50,710
♫ Think pink!
Forget that Dior says black and rust

63
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,540
♫ Think pink! Who cares
if the new look has no bust?

64
00:04:54,677 --> 00:04:56,669
♫ Now, I wouldn't presume to tell a woman

65
00:04:56,804 --> 00:04:58,262
♫ What a woman ought to think

66
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:00,879
♫ But tell her if she's gotta think,
think pink

67
00:05:01,016 --> 00:05:03,589
(women) ♫ For bags, pink for shoes

68
00:05:03,727 --> 00:05:06,264
♫ Razzle, dazzle and spread the news

69
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:10,063
♫ And pink's for the lady
with joie de vivre

70
00:05:11,734 --> 00:05:14,485
♫ Pink's for all the family

71
00:05:14,945 --> 00:05:17,815
♫ Try pink shampoo

72
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:20,274
♫ Pink toothpaste too!

73
00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:23,316
♫ Play in pink, all day in pink

74
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:26,240
♫ Pretty gayin' pink

75
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:29,990
♫ Drive in pink

76
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,156
♫ Come alive in pink

77
00:05:31,293 --> 00:05:34,128
♫ Have a dive in pink

78
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:41,425
♫ Go out dancing
but just remember one thing

79
00:05:41,553 --> 00:05:43,296
♫ You can get a little wink

80
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,138
♫ If you got a little pink

81
00:05:45,265 --> 00:05:48,965
♫ In your swing

82
00:05:51,812 --> 00:05:56,937
♫ Think pink! Think pink,
it's the latest word, you know

83
00:05:58,151 --> 00:06:02,979
♫ Think pink! Think pink,
and you're Michelangelo

84
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:07,450
♫ Feels so gay, feels so bright

85
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,945
♫ Makes your day, makes your night

86
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,946
♫ Pink is now the colour to which
you gotta switch

87
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,707
♫ To which you gotta switch

88
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,033
♫ Every stitch

89
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,829
♫ Every stitch you switch

90
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:24,588
♫ Think pink! Think pink
on the long, long road ahead

91
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,127
♫ On the road

92
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,968
♫ Think pink! Think pink,
and the world is rosy red

93
00:06:31,097 --> 00:06:32,591
♫ Everything's rosy

94
00:06:32,724 --> 00:06:35,641
♫ Everything on the great horizon

95
00:06:35,768 --> 00:06:38,010
♫ Everything that you can think

96
00:06:38,771 --> 00:06:41,855
♫ And that includes the kitchen sink

97
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,858
♫ Think pink

98
00:06:43,984 --> 00:06:45,644
♫ Think pink, think pink

99
00:06:45,777 --> 00:06:47,236
♫ Think pink, think pink

100
00:06:47,362 --> 00:06:50,031
♫ Think pink, think pink,
think pink!

101
00:06:53,242 --> 00:06:54,701
Maggie?

102
00:06:55,286 --> 00:06:57,159
Dovitch! I want to see you.

103
00:06:57,287 --> 00:07:00,371
Girls, back to work.
Gentlemen, that will do!

104
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:03,120
The Union Pacific railroad
is going to paint a whole train pink

105
00:07:03,251 --> 00:07:04,745
and send it on a north west tour.

106
00:07:04,878 --> 00:07:07,582
TWA will let me know this afternoon
if we can have a pink plane.

107
00:07:07,713 --> 00:07:11,047
I haven't seen a woman in two weeks
in anything but pink.

108
00:07:11,175 --> 00:07:14,508
- What about you?
- Me? I wouldn't be caught dead!

109
00:07:14,636 --> 00:07:18,468
Dovitch, I can't wait to tell you
about my feature for the next issue.

110
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:22,180
It's my newest project.
And when you hear it, you will drop!

111
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,551
- Now what?
- Just you listen.

112
00:07:24,687 --> 00:07:27,356
Dick Avery started working on
the pictures this morning.

113
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:29,972
He's more excited about it
than any of us.

114
00:07:30,108 --> 00:07:34,188
Here it is. Clothes for the woman
who isn't interested in clothes.

115
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:38,153
(man) Marion, give me a long look.

116
00:07:38,282 --> 00:07:39,362
Longer.

117
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:42,115
Longer!

118
00:07:42,245 --> 00:07:46,243
Steve, eh, tip that back light down
a bit, will you? OK.

119
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:52,419
Hold it, boys.
Beethoven isn't working. Try Brahms.

120
00:07:52,546 --> 00:07:56,246
Ahm, look, Marion,
I'd like to try it again.

121
00:07:56,383 --> 00:07:59,004
This time,
let's see if we can't get with it.

122
00:07:59,135 --> 00:08:02,006
Keep in mind
that you're a woman who thinks.

123
00:08:02,138 --> 00:08:05,008
Now, that is a piece of
sculpture by Itsabuchi.

124
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:10,098
Look at it as if you understand it.
As if it understands you. See?

125
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:17,317
No Marion, I'm afraid that's not the way we
look when we're thinking of Itsabuchi.

126
00:08:17,443 --> 00:08:20,397
React to it. Just... say it.

127
00:08:21,822 --> 00:08:24,906
Itsabuchi, hmm?

128
00:08:25,993 --> 00:08:30,072
You haven't quite got it.
Now, listen carefully.

129
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:33,158
You are in the Museum of Modern Art,
Marion.

130
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:36,161
Deep, Marion. Profound, Marion.

131
00:08:36,293 --> 00:08:39,413
You have come across this statue.
And it says something to you

132
00:08:39,546 --> 00:08:42,037
because you are intellectual,
always thinking.

133
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:45,339
What are you thinking?

134
00:08:45,468 --> 00:08:48,041
I'm thinking this
is taking a long time,

135
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:51,678
and I'll never be able to
pick up Harold's laundry.

136
00:08:51,974 --> 00:08:55,177
When Harold doesn't get his laundry,
disaster!

137
00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:00,186
If we don't get this fixed, you may never
see Harold's laundry or Harold again. Let's go.

138
00:09:00,315 --> 00:09:04,312
The woman who thinks must come
to grips with fashionable attire.

139
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:08,571
A woman can be beautiful, as well
as intellectual. See facing page.

140
00:09:08,697 --> 00:09:10,108
And how is the facing page?

141
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,238
The facing page looks about
as intellectual as a snake.

142
00:09:14,369 --> 00:09:17,121
Nonsense. Marion can be very deep.

143
00:09:17,247 --> 00:09:19,286
Look at her. She's reading.

144
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,536
Marion, dear, what are you reading?

145
00:09:23,669 --> 00:09:25,128
Minute Men From Mars!

146
00:09:26,797 --> 00:09:30,212
Are we all gonna hang around,
or get somebody else?

147
00:09:30,342 --> 00:09:32,879
- How about Lucy Brand?
- On her honeymoon.

148
00:09:33,011 --> 00:09:35,680
- Betty Hayes?
- She's in jail.

149
00:09:35,805 --> 00:09:38,474
Are there no models around
who can think as well as they look?

150
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:41,601
Marion might look better
in a different background.

151
00:09:41,728 --> 00:09:44,266
We can go on location.
Some intellectual hang-out.

152
00:09:44,397 --> 00:09:46,389
- Somewhere with books.
- A book store!

153
00:09:46,524 --> 00:09:50,189
Of course! One of those sinister places
in Greenwich Village. Come on, girls!

154
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:54,482
Let's hurry. We might have to stop and
pick up Harold's laundry on the way.

155
00:10:02,038 --> 00:10:03,283
There's one.

156
00:10:04,248 --> 00:10:05,825
(Dick) Driver, stop here.

157
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,416
That's sinister enough.

158
00:10:10,795 --> 00:10:13,417
Melissa, for heaven's sake, help me
with this lamp! It's heavy.

159
00:10:13,548 --> 00:10:15,873
I can't, Babs, I got my hands full.

160
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:26,801
It's movingly dismal. We couldn't
have done better if we'd designed it ourselves.

161
00:10:26,935 --> 00:10:29,223
Marion looks smarter already.

162
00:10:29,354 --> 00:10:30,978
(woman screams)

163
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:37,564
I'm sorry. I didn't see you up there.
Are you alright?

164
00:10:39,363 --> 00:10:43,941
Yes, thank you. Can I help you?
Would you like a book?

165
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:47,942
- (Miss Prescott) Marion, over here.
- Who are those?

166
00:10:49,205 --> 00:10:50,580
May I help you?

167
00:10:50,706 --> 00:10:53,576
Thank you very much.
I think we have everything we need.

168
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:55,666
Please tell me what all this is about.

169
00:10:55,794 --> 00:10:58,000
We're just going to take
a few pictures.

170
00:10:58,129 --> 00:10:59,707
Pictures? What sort of pictures?

171
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,879
- Are you the owner?
- No, Dr Post is.

172
00:11:02,008 --> 00:11:04,296
I work here,
and I'm in charge in her absence.

173
00:11:04,427 --> 00:11:07,131
I'm Jo Stockton. Can you help me?

174
00:11:07,263 --> 00:11:09,338
How do you do? I'm Dick Avery.

175
00:11:09,473 --> 00:11:10,967
What about these pictures?

176
00:11:11,099 --> 00:11:12,724
Well, we are using the
shop as a background

177
00:11:12,851 --> 00:11:15,520
for some fashion pictures
for Quality magazine.

178
00:11:15,645 --> 00:11:19,179
I'm sorry. but I can't let you do
this. Dr Post would never approve.

179
00:11:19,315 --> 00:11:21,557
She doesn't approve
of fashion magazines.

180
00:11:21,692 --> 00:11:25,559
It's chi-chi and an unrealistic
approach to self-impressions
as well as economics.

181
00:11:25,696 --> 00:11:29,313
- We're going to have trouble. She's a thinker.
- She's also a talker!

182
00:11:29,449 --> 00:11:31,276
I must ask you to leave.

183
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:33,200
We throw ourselves at your mercy.

184
00:11:33,327 --> 00:11:36,447
Haven't poor helpless people like us
a right to make a living?

185
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,537
I have asked you to leave.
That is my right.

186
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,243
If the rights of the individual

187
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:43,162
are not respected by the group,
the group itself cannot exist for long.

188
00:11:43,295 --> 00:11:44,494
What does that mean?

189
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,963
"Do unto others as
you would have others do unto you."

190
00:11:48,092 --> 00:11:50,084
We'll only do unto you for a moment,

191
00:11:50,219 --> 00:11:53,634
and it's no more
than we would do unto ourselves.

192
00:11:53,763 --> 00:11:55,886
Girls, I want all these books rearranged.

193
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:59,265
They look too much alike.
They're too pat. Mix them up.

194
00:11:59,393 --> 00:12:01,516
No, you mustn't mix them up.

195
00:12:01,645 --> 00:12:04,219
The books on this shelf
pertain to empiricism,

196
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:07,974
and on this shelf, materialism,
and on this, psychopiscoparalysm.

197
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,525
Put them back. Oh, please talk to her.
It'll take me hours.

198
00:12:11,654 --> 00:12:14,572
One never talks to Maggie Prescott.
One only listens.

199
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:18,648
Here. I think we ought to use her
in the shot. Miss, come here, please.

200
00:12:18,786 --> 00:12:21,952
- Me?
- You're selling a book to that girl.

201
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,076
Her?

202
00:12:23,206 --> 00:12:25,531
It's very simple. Just pretend
that Marion can read.

203
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:27,125
Say, listen!

204
00:12:27,252 --> 00:12:28,746
Alright, Marion, let's go.

205
00:12:28,878 --> 00:12:32,294
But this would be a violation
of all my principles!

206
00:12:32,423 --> 00:12:35,210
It would be hypocrisy for me
to lend myself to this sort of idealism.

207
00:12:35,342 --> 00:12:36,753
- I'm sorry, but...
- Shush.

208
00:12:36,885 --> 00:12:40,384
Now, tell Marion about the books
so that we can get out of here.

209
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:46,304
This book deals with epiphenomenalism,
which has to do with consciousness

210
00:12:46,435 --> 00:12:49,389
as a mere accessory
of physiological processes

211
00:12:49,521 --> 00:12:54,432
whose presence or absence
makes no difference...

212
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,149
Whatever are you doing?

213
00:12:57,278 --> 00:12:58,559
Alright, hold it!

214
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:01,650
- Good. Get her in another outfit.
- Put on the shebop.

215
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:05,649
None of you seems to realise you're
trespassing on private property.

216
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:09,320
You run around, sublime ignorant of the fact
that I can have you put in jail.

217
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,994
- For the last time...
- You're getting tiresome.

218
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,536
What are you doing?

219
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,660
Let go. Let go of my arm!

220
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,080
I know you don't mean any harm child,
but you are in everyone's way.

221
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,625
Now, we won't be a moment.

222
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,211
Let me in!

223
00:13:23,343 --> 00:13:26,629
The air will do her good.
She was very pale.

224
00:13:35,104 --> 00:13:36,135
Alright, hit it.

225
00:13:36,563 --> 00:13:38,437
Hold it. Ready?

226
00:13:38,565 --> 00:13:40,356
Good. One more, please.

227
00:13:40,484 --> 00:13:42,559
Alright. Hit it.

228
00:13:42,694 --> 00:13:43,773
Hold it. Ready?

229
00:13:44,863 --> 00:13:47,485
Very good, Marion.
One more, please. Last one.

230
00:13:47,616 --> 00:13:48,814
Alright, here we go.

231
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:50,409
Hit it.

232
00:13:50,535 --> 00:13:52,326
Hold it. Ready.

233
00:13:52,454 --> 00:13:55,123
OK, that's it. That ought to do.

234
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,416
(bell rings)

235
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:15,844
- Quite through?
- Thank you. You've been wonderful.

236
00:14:15,975 --> 00:14:18,216
We'll mention the shop
in the magazine.

237
00:14:18,352 --> 00:14:19,632
Don't you dare!

238
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,596
(Miss Prescott) Taxi!

239
00:14:22,689 --> 00:14:23,685
(bell jingles)

240
00:14:23,815 --> 00:14:26,057
Oh, no!

241
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:29,689
Oh!

242
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,231
Hello there.

243
00:14:31,363 --> 00:14:33,486
I stayed to help you
put these things back.

244
00:14:33,615 --> 00:14:35,987
I'm sorry, I didn't realise
we made such a mess.

245
00:14:36,118 --> 00:14:38,655
Which shelf for materialism?

246
00:14:38,787 --> 00:14:41,028
Just hand them to me.

247
00:14:42,332 --> 00:14:44,573
Oh, no.

248
00:14:47,711 --> 00:14:49,585
You should be ashamed of yourself.

249
00:14:49,713 --> 00:14:51,622
I'm sorry, we don't usually
barge in that way.

250
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:54,793
I mean a man of your ability
wasting his time

251
00:14:54,926 --> 00:14:57,796
photographing silly dresses
on silly women.

252
00:14:58,721 --> 00:15:02,588
Most people think they're
beautiful dresses on beautiful women.

253
00:15:02,725 --> 00:15:04,966
At most, a synthetic beauty.

254
00:15:06,061 --> 00:15:07,888
Trees are beautiful.

255
00:15:09,939 --> 00:15:12,264
Why don't you photograph trees?

256
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,519
I do what I do for a living.
It has to do with supply and demand.

257
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:19,068
You'd be amazed how small
the demand is for pictures of trees.

258
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:21,523
My work is very pleasant,
the pay is excellent,

259
00:15:21,658 --> 00:15:23,567
and I get a trip to Paris every year.

260
00:15:23,702 --> 00:15:25,196
I certainly envy you that.

261
00:15:25,328 --> 00:15:28,115
I'd be in Paris now
if I could afford it.

262
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,328
You'd have a ball.

263
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,915
You'd go to a party every night,
drink nothing but champagne,

264
00:15:35,045 --> 00:15:38,496
swim in perfume, and a new love
affair every hour on the hour.

265
00:15:38,632 --> 00:15:42,415
If I went to Paris, it would be
to go to Emile Flostre's lectures.

266
00:15:42,552 --> 00:15:44,509
Who goes to Paris for lectures?

267
00:15:44,637 --> 00:15:47,554
Professor Flostre
is the greatest living philosopher,

268
00:15:47,682 --> 00:15:50,090
and father of empathicalism.

269
00:15:50,226 --> 00:15:52,896
Oh? What's empathicalism?

270
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:58,266
The most sensible approach to
true understanding and peace of mind.

271
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,942
Sounds great, but what is it?

272
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:01,812
It's based on empathy.

273
00:16:01,945 --> 00:16:04,270
Do you know
what the word "empathy" means?

274
00:16:04,406 --> 00:16:07,323
No, I'll have to have
the beginner's course on that one.

275
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,941
Empathy.
Is it something like sympathy?

276
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:11,986
Oh, it goes beyond sympathy.

277
00:16:12,121 --> 00:16:14,825
Sympathy is to understand
what someone feels.

278
00:16:14,957 --> 00:16:17,282
Empathy is to project
your imagination

279
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:21,462
so that you actually feel
what the other person is feeling.

280
00:16:21,588 --> 00:16:24,423
You put yourself
in the other person's place.

281
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:26,790
Do I make myself clear?

282
00:16:36,977 --> 00:16:39,550
- Why did you do that?
- Empathy.

283
00:16:39,687 --> 00:16:43,637
I put myself in your place and
I felt that you wanted to be kissed.

284
00:16:45,734 --> 00:16:47,940
I'm afraid you put yourself
in the wrong place.

285
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:51,688
I have no desire to be kissed
by you, or anyone else.

286
00:16:51,823 --> 00:16:55,523
Don't be silly. Everybody wants
to be kissed, even philosophers.

287
00:16:56,911 --> 00:17:00,077
I'm sorry, Mr Avery, we don't stock
what you're looking for.

288
00:17:00,206 --> 00:17:01,450
I'll let you out.

289
00:17:01,582 --> 00:17:04,867
Don't bother. I'll throw myself out.

290
00:17:08,671 --> 00:17:09,667
Goodbye.

291
00:17:11,174 --> 00:17:13,629

(Miss Prescott) Well, Dovitch,
what do you think?

325
00:21:35,912 --> 00:21:38,319
(Dovitch) They're all good models.
What have you got in mind?

326
00:21:38,456 --> 00:21:40,365
(Miss Prescott) A fantastic idea.

327
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,955
It staggers me that
nobody's thought of it before.

328
00:21:43,085 --> 00:21:45,754
I'm going to select a girl
to be the Quality Woman.

329
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:49,462
This one girl will represent everything
the magazine stands for.

330
00:21:49,591 --> 00:21:53,090
It's a great gimmick. Well, any
of these models would be alright.

331
00:21:53,219 --> 00:21:57,134
She's got to be more than alright.
She's got to have pizzazz.

332
00:21:57,265 --> 00:22:01,132
An entire collection is going to be designed
for her by the greatest couturier in Paris.

333
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:03,676
- Paul Duval?
- Yes, Paul Duval.

334
00:22:03,813 --> 00:22:08,059
And he's going to let us photograph
the collection before the opening.

335
00:22:08,192 --> 00:22:10,564
We'll scoop every other magazine!

336
00:22:10,694 --> 00:22:12,900
- Staggers you, doesn't it?
- I can't believe it.

337
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:17,109
Why, he would be barred from Harper's Bazaar and
Vogue, and all the other fashion magazines!

338
00:22:17,242 --> 00:22:21,109
Nonsense. If the project comes off,
we'll all be heroes.

339
00:22:21,245 --> 00:22:25,492
Wait till you see what I've got.
The girl. The Quality Woman.

340
00:22:25,624 --> 00:22:26,787
Oh, Marion's...

341
00:22:26,917 --> 00:22:29,953
Forget about Marion. This is the other girl
I'm talking about.

342
00:22:30,086 --> 00:22:31,995
That thing from the book shop?

343
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,703
Maggie, she's new.

344
00:22:35,174 --> 00:22:36,503
She's fresh.

345
00:22:36,676 --> 00:22:38,253
You've gone out of your mind.

346
00:22:38,385 --> 00:22:41,505
One can't deny that she is, ehm,
unusual. Who is she?

347
00:22:41,638 --> 00:22:45,422
Don't even ask. The thought of her
makes me shudder. Dreadful, dreadful girl.

348
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:47,385
If this is some sort of joke...

349
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:50,970
It's no joke. If we do her over
and fix her up, she'd be great for us.

350
00:22:51,105 --> 00:22:52,385
She'd devour us all.

351
00:22:52,523 --> 00:22:54,681
- Come on, Maggie.
- Well, look at her.

352
00:22:55,859 --> 00:22:57,816
I think her face is perfectly funny.

353
00:22:57,945 --> 00:23:01,064
The Quality Woman must have grace,
elegance and pizzazz.

354
00:23:01,197 --> 00:23:03,867
This is the first time
I've seen you lack imagination.

355
00:23:03,992 --> 00:23:07,407
Every girl in Quality
has grace, elegance and pizzazz.

356
00:23:07,536 --> 00:23:10,905
What about a girl with character,
spirit and intelligence?

357
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,246
That certainly would be novel
in a fashion magazine.

358
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:15,332
Sir, I owe you a drink.

359
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,369
Can you make me some black
and white enlargements?

360
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,211
- Yes.
- Use our darkroom.

361
00:23:19,339 --> 00:23:22,256
- Let me study the possibilities.
- Now you are talking.

362
00:23:22,383 --> 00:23:25,384
- I'm not promising anything.
- You don't have to.

363
00:23:26,512 --> 00:23:29,845
Runs around here
like he owns the magazine!

364
00:23:29,973 --> 00:23:32,464
Lettie, remember that creature
in the book shop?

365
00:23:32,601 --> 00:23:34,308
Get her up here. Order some books.

366
00:23:34,435 --> 00:23:37,685
- A large order, so she can't refuse.
- $50 worth?

367
00:23:37,813 --> 00:23:40,351
Yes, $50 worth if necessary.

368
00:23:40,483 --> 00:23:44,811
$50 to get her up here. We'll have to
drug her to get her to Paris.

369
00:23:53,327 --> 00:23:55,996
Er, Miss Prescott, please.

370
00:23:56,122 --> 00:23:59,954
- Lettie, you'd better come out here.
- I've got the books she ordered.

371
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,995
Miss Prescott's secretary
will deal with you.

372
00:24:04,672 --> 00:24:07,542
Oh, it's you. Well, come on in.

373
00:24:08,217 --> 00:24:09,415
Come on.

374
00:24:15,265 --> 00:24:16,759
The books are here.

375
00:24:21,562 --> 00:24:22,760
Come in.

376
00:24:30,653 --> 00:24:34,982
That'll be $52 and 75 cents,
and $1.20 for the taxi.

377
00:24:35,116 --> 00:24:36,942
$53.95.

378
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:38,867
Drop the books.

379
00:24:38,994 --> 00:24:40,572
Come on, drop the books.

380
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,946
- On the floor?
- Yes, drop them.

381
00:24:45,959 --> 00:24:47,702
Straighten up, shoulders back.

382
00:24:47,835 --> 00:24:51,880
If you girls only knew
how important posture is.

383
00:24:52,006 --> 00:24:54,627
Look, I didn't come here
to enroll in a military school.

384
00:24:54,758 --> 00:24:57,545
All I want is $53.95.

385
00:24:57,677 --> 00:24:59,385
The Modigliani is $12.50,

386
00:24:59,512 --> 00:25:02,846
and the Braque and Hieronymus Bosch
come to $22.75.

387
00:25:02,974 --> 00:25:05,097
$7 for the post-impressionists

388
00:25:05,226 --> 00:25:08,143
and $10.50 for The Egyptians -
Fourth to Seventh Dynasties

389
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:12,433
make it a total of $52.75,
and there's $1.20 for the taxi.

390
00:25:12,566 --> 00:25:14,973
- Talks incessantly.
- The body's good.

391
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,731
It'll be better
when we get through with it.

392
00:25:17,862 --> 00:25:21,231
- Through with what?
- She might do.

393
00:25:21,365 --> 00:25:22,776
Might do what?

394
00:25:23,701 --> 00:25:25,325
The bones are good.

395
00:25:25,452 --> 00:25:29,070
Suppose we leave my bones alone
and give me my $53.95?

396
00:25:29,206 --> 00:25:31,115
The eyebrows up, a light powder.

397
00:25:31,249 --> 00:25:34,369
I want a little rouge here.
She needs a marvelous mouth.

398
00:25:34,502 --> 00:25:36,993
The hair is awful. It must come off.

399
00:25:37,129 --> 00:25:39,702
Would you mind telling me
what all this is about?

400
00:25:40,174 --> 00:25:43,922
We may as well get started. Babs,
get that dreadful thing off of her.

401
00:25:44,052 --> 00:25:46,757
Now, wait a minute. Just a minute!

402
00:25:46,888 --> 00:25:48,715
Don't! Stop!

403
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:52,717
This is my second and last encounter
with you lunatics.

404
00:25:52,852 --> 00:25:55,307
You just keep your hands off me,
all of you.

405
00:25:55,979 --> 00:25:59,431
I come here to make a simple delivery and I
find myself being pillaged and plundered.

406
00:25:59,567 --> 00:26:02,770
Well, I'll have no more of it.
I don't want my hair cut.

407
00:26:02,903 --> 00:26:06,237
I don't want my eyebrows up or down.
I want them where they are.

408
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:11,110
And I see no functional advantage
in a marvelous mouth.

409
00:26:11,244 --> 00:26:14,198
I'm leaving now, and if anyone
makes a move to stop me

410
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:17,200
there'll be plenty of hair cut,
and it won't be mine.

411
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,824
Bring her back, girls, alive!

412
00:26:28,843 --> 00:26:30,254
(women) Hurry up.

413
00:26:33,556 --> 00:26:35,595
Hurry. Over here.

414
00:26:42,856 --> 00:26:45,525
Hey,
didn't you see that light outside?

415
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,899
In desperation, one does not examine
one's avenue of escape.

416
00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:51,571
Oh, it's you.

417
00:26:54,199 --> 00:26:56,357
I'm sorry if I spoiled a print.

418
00:26:56,493 --> 00:27:00,324
That's alright.
What's all the desperation about?

419
00:27:00,455 --> 00:27:02,162
Those people.

420
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:05,160
They don't care about
anyone's feelings.

421
00:27:05,918 --> 00:27:08,872
Pulling my clothes
and cutting my hair.

422
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:12,005
- (knock at door)
- (woman) Is that girl in there?

423
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:14,089
(whispers) Please don't give me away!

424
00:27:14,217 --> 00:27:16,423
Maybe you should give them
a chance...

425
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,675
There was no one here when I came in.

426
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,844
If you see her, hang on to her.

427
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,177
I'll do that.

428
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:30,223
I'm afraid it's all my fault.
I thought you'd make a good model.

429
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,691
This is your idea?

430
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,726
Yeah, I'm the one you sue.

431
00:27:35,361 --> 00:27:37,400
Oh, how could I be a model?

432
00:27:38,322 --> 00:27:41,773
I have no illusions about my looks.
I think my face is funny.

433
00:27:41,908 --> 00:27:43,486
That's what Maggie said.

434
00:27:43,618 --> 00:27:45,575
I hate to admit it,
but she's right.

435
00:27:45,703 --> 00:27:49,321
What you call funny,
I call interesting.

436
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:54,544
It's too ridiculous
even to think about.

437
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:58,370
- I couldn't do it.
- Let me be the judge of that.

438
00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:02,999
I wouldn't take you to Paris
if I didn't think you'd work out.

439
00:28:03,137 --> 00:28:06,303
- Paris?
- Yeah. Look at it this way.

440
00:28:06,431 --> 00:28:08,637
Modeling
may not be as bad as you think.

441
00:28:08,808 --> 00:28:13,019
If it is, you'll be in Paris.
You can see your friend Professor Whosis.

442
00:28:13,146 --> 00:28:14,770
- Flostre?
- Yeah.

443
00:28:14,897 --> 00:28:17,352
You can talk to him
and go to his lectures.

444
00:28:17,483 --> 00:28:19,522
That way it won't be a total loss.

445
00:28:20,485 --> 00:28:22,312
A means to an end.

446
00:28:22,446 --> 00:28:25,814
Or a means to a beginning,
according to how it works out.

447
00:28:25,949 --> 00:28:27,147
Now, let's see.

448
00:28:28,868 --> 00:28:30,410
There we are.

449
00:28:30,536 --> 00:28:33,537
- Oh, no.
- What's the matter?

450
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,949
How can you possibly
make a model out of that?

451
00:28:37,084 --> 00:28:38,542
You can't be serious.

452
00:28:38,668 --> 00:28:40,910
When I'm done, you'll look like...

453
00:28:41,045 --> 00:28:45,707
What do you call beautiful?
A tree. You'll look like a tree.

454

Marvelous!

486
00:32:19,826 --> 00:32:22,399
I'm sorry about the trouble.
I didn't realise.

487
00:32:22,537 --> 00:32:26,534
My dear, let me do the apologizing.
I behaved abominably.

488
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:29,203
She's agreed to go to Paris.
She can hardly wait.

489
00:32:29,335 --> 00:32:30,330
Marvelous!

490
00:32:30,461 --> 00:32:34,410
This is not a loss of integrity.
It is a means to an end, and...

491
00:32:34,548 --> 00:32:37,169
There's no time for talking.
Tell us on the plane.

492
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:41,132
Alright, girls, we've got to
get cracking. To work and to Paris.

493
00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:41,013
- Would you like to take a guided tour of Paris?
- No no no, we're not tourists.

494
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:43,390
Do we look like those people who
run around gaping all day?


495
00:33:43,526 --> 00:33:46,099
I guess they can't understand
anyone coming to Paris to work.

496
00:33:46,237 --> 00:33:49,403
We should all go straight to
our hotels and get some rest.

497
00:33:49,531 --> 00:33:51,773
- I am exhausted.
- I know how you feel.

Bonjour!

00:39:03,606 --> 00:39:05,433
Well, how was that?

579

- Allo?
- (chatter)

580
00:39:12,322 --> 00:39:16,616
Duval! I can't hear myself think,
and I'm trying to think in French.

581
00:39:16,743 --> 00:39:19,198
- Maggie!
- Ssh! I'm calling again.

582
00:39:19,329 --> 00:39:21,866
I shouldn't design
a collection for you.

583
00:39:21,998 --> 00:39:25,615
I am jeopardizing my position
with Harper's Bazaar and Vogue,

584
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:27,542
all for a girl who does not appear.

585
00:39:27,669 --> 00:39:32,829
You're too important for jeopardy.
Relax. She will be here without fail.

586
00:39:32,966 --> 00:39:36,500
You said she would be here at ten
this morning. It is now past five.

587
00:39:36,636 --> 00:39:38,961
- She's not at the hotel.
- Forget about her.

588
00:39:39,096 --> 00:39:42,595
We've started the campaign.
There isn't time to get someone else.

589
00:39:42,724 --> 00:39:43,756
Well, where is she?

590
00:39:43,892 --> 00:39:47,343
Maybe at the top of the Eiffel Tower,
or the bottom of the Seine.

591
00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:50,314
Maybe she's in a traffic jam.
How should I know?

592
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,638
Oh, c'est naturel.

593
00:39:53,234 --> 00:39:55,772
(both) ♫ Bonjour, Paris

594

Bonjour, bonjour.

595
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:00,816
I'm throwing a shindig
to christen the Quality Woman.

596
00:40:00,949 --> 00:40:03,522
Leave it to Dick to find
a delicatessen in Paris.

597
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,744
Imported all the way

598
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:08,033
Melons from Florida.

599
00:40:08,164 --> 00:40:11,283
About the guest of honour.
Where is she? How does she look?

600
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:13,623
If she's here, she looks invisible.

601
00:40:13,752 --> 00:40:15,461
- She didn't show?
- She did not.

602
00:40:15,588 --> 00:40:18,161
These gentlemen are waiting
to do her face, her hair.

603
00:40:18,299 --> 00:40:20,754
Duval needs measurements.
Where is she?

604
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:23,755
I wouldn't like to swear in court,
but I have a pretty good idea.

605
00:40:23,887 --> 00:40:26,460
(Miss Prescott)
Do keep it to yourself!

606
00:40:26,598 --> 00:40:29,967
I'll have her here tomorrow morning
at ten o'clock without fail.

607
00:40:30,101 --> 00:40:32,058
In the meantime, be my guests.

608
00:40:34,939 --> 00:40:35,934
Strike.

609
00:40:46,616 --> 00:40:47,814
(beeping)

610
00:40:55,999 --> 00:40:57,956
Salaud! Dégueulasse!

611
00:40:58,084 --> 00:40:59,282
Je vous déteste!

612
00:40:59,961 --> 00:41:01,159
Oh, chérie!

613
00:41:02,463 --> 00:41:04,290
This must be the place.

614
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:14,097
(band tunes up)

615
00:41:17,894 --> 00:41:19,092
Thank you.

616
00:41:20,813 --> 00:41:23,767
Monsieur, Gigi would like to dance.

617
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:25,856
- Who's Gigi?
- I am Gigi.

618
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:29,816
Some other time. I just stopped by
to pick up the wife and kids.

619
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:34,026
All that is delicious
is not nutritious.

620
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,323
Avaricious, av...

621
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,658
I feel a hostile vibration.

622
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:40,412
That'll be me. Sorry.

623
00:41:47,295 --> 00:41:48,789
Has he been that way long?

624
00:41:48,921 --> 00:41:51,839
Three hours.
It is the ultimate in concentration.

625
00:41:51,966 --> 00:41:53,709
Feels so good when you stop.

626
00:41:55,469 --> 00:41:58,007
I have no doubt in my mind
that in less than ten years,

627
00:41:58,138 --> 00:42:03,214
people everywhere will know that
only empathicalism can bring peace.

628
00:42:03,351 --> 00:42:06,850
Peace through understanding
is the only real...

629
00:42:07,938 --> 00:42:10,607
Well, hello, how are you?

630
00:42:10,733 --> 00:42:12,690
Just fine, thank you.
How are you?

631
00:42:12,818 --> 00:42:14,478
How long have you been in Paris?

632
00:42:14,611 --> 00:42:16,937
This is Mr Avery.
These are my friends.

633
00:42:17,073 --> 00:42:19,112
How do you do, boys?

634
00:42:19,241 --> 00:42:22,740
Would you mind if I had
my own conversation with this lady?

635
00:42:22,869 --> 00:42:26,036
- They don't understand English.
- You were talking English.

636
00:42:26,164 --> 00:42:29,912
It's hard to explain,
but it's all part of empathicalism.

637
00:42:30,042 --> 00:42:32,913
We don't have to communicate
with words.

638
00:42:33,045 --> 00:42:36,912
They understand me through the way
I feel, and the tone of my voice.

639
00:42:37,049 --> 00:42:40,583
- Sort of like a dog?
- Obviously, you don't understand!

640
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:42,213
Who's buying the wine?

641
00:42:42,345 --> 00:42:44,752
- I am.
- I understand more than you think!

642
00:42:44,889 --> 00:42:48,423
- If you're saying that the wine...
- Let me show you something.

643
00:42:50,477 --> 00:42:54,309
Gentlemen, may I tell you
that you look like a mess of worms?

644
00:42:54,439 --> 00:42:58,271
And that you not only look like,
but you are, a mess of worms.

645
00:42:58,401 --> 00:43:00,808
I'll bet you've been here
all these years

646
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:03,862
because if you left,
you'd be picked up for vagrancy.

647
00:43:03,989 --> 00:43:06,527
- Bravo.
- Your defence rests.

648
00:43:06,658 --> 00:43:08,781
This isn't funny.
You don't belong here.

649
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:11,662
Neither do you,
which brings us to why I'm here.

650
00:43:11,788 --> 00:43:13,579
Monsieur, you dance with Mimi?

651
00:43:13,706 --> 00:43:16,162
No, thanks, I'm busy.
Didn't Gigi tell you?

652
00:43:16,292 --> 00:43:19,708
That's very rude,
refusing to dance with Mimi.

653
00:43:19,837 --> 00:43:22,754
Where I come from,
the man asks the girl to dance.

654
00:43:22,881 --> 00:43:24,921
You must come from the Stone Age!

655
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:29,546
We think freely here. If a girl wants
to dance with a man, she asks him.

656
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:33,213
We're not inhibited by
outmoded sociaI conventions.

657
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:36,848
I can see that.
Do you ask men to dance with you?

658
00:43:37,561 --> 00:43:39,185
Isn't it time you realised

659
00:43:39,313 --> 00:43:43,641
that dancing is nothing more than
a form of expression or release?

660
00:43:43,775 --> 00:43:47,060
There's no need to be formal
or cute about it.

661
00:43:47,195 --> 00:43:51,524
As a matter of fact, I rather feel
like expressing myself now.

662
00:43:51,657 --> 00:43:53,815
And I could certainly use a release.

663
00:43:53,951 --> 00:43:55,990
(discordant dramatic music)

664
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,320
(slow, moody jazz)

665
00:45:50,764 --> 00:45:53,220
(fast jazz)

666
00:47:30,938 --> 00:47:34,389
- Bonsoir. Vous étiez formidable.
- Merci.

667
00:47:34,525 --> 00:47:37,525
Well, you certainly made friends
and influenced people.

668
00:47:37,652 --> 00:47:39,941
They're empathicalists.

669
00:47:40,071 --> 00:47:44,697
You talk a lot about this empathy.
Ever do anything about it yourself?

670
00:47:44,825 --> 00:47:46,367
I don't know what you mean.

671
00:47:46,494 --> 00:47:50,408
- Why not throw some empathy my way?
- I still don't know what you mean.

672
00:47:50,539 --> 00:47:53,112
How do you think I feel when
you don't show up for the job?

673
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:54,530
I'm responsible for you.

674
00:47:54,668 --> 00:47:58,535
An empathicalist should feel me
asking for unemployment insurance.

675
00:47:58,671 --> 00:48:00,249
Show up where?

676
00:48:00,381 --> 00:48:04,330
They've been waiting for you
at Duval's all day.

677
00:48:04,468 --> 00:48:07,385
I had no idea. Nobody told me.

678
00:48:07,512 --> 00:48:10,383
We've been calling you
on the telephone for hours.

679
00:48:12,308 --> 00:48:17,053
I've been at the cafe all day.
I'm terribly sorry.

680
00:48:17,188 --> 00:48:20,354
Now, I don't want to sound like
the personnel department,

681
00:48:20,482 --> 00:48:23,852
but you ought to get to bed early.
The camera picks up everything.

682
00:48:23,986 --> 00:48:27,022
I don't want to spend my entire
life retouching your pictures.

683
00:48:27,156 --> 00:48:31,070
When we're finished, you can spend
all your time making small talk.

684
00:48:31,201 --> 00:48:35,412
Small talk? I suppose you think
the neckline of a dress

685
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:38,492
makes for world-shaking conversation?

686
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:41,791
Anything you don't understand,
you call small talk.

687
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,955
- What do you think of Flostre?
- Don't change the subject.

688
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:47,923
- It's the same subject.
- I haven't met Flostre.

689
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,584
You haven't? By now
I thought you two'd be buddies.

690
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:55,847
You don't find Flostre in cafes,
except on special occasions.

691
00:48:55,973 --> 00:48:59,389
Not everyone interested in
empathicalism meets him,

692
00:48:59,518 --> 00:49:02,435
any more than every American
meets the President.

693
00:49:02,562 --> 00:49:05,896
An invitation to Flostre's home
is a great honour,

694
00:49:06,024 --> 00:49:08,479
and as hard to get
as an invitation to...

695
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:10,353
The White House.

696
00:49:10,486 --> 00:49:13,238
I don't think jokes about
professor Flostre are funny.

697
00:49:13,364 --> 00:49:16,779
No more jokes. But let's be friendly.
We have to work together you know.

698
00:49:16,909 --> 00:49:21,202
You don't have to be friendly
to work together. Acquainted will do.

699
00:49:21,329 --> 00:49:23,618
Am I supposed to
go over to Duval's now?

700
00:49:23,748 --> 00:49:25,575
I said you'd be there
at 10:30 in the morning.

701
00:49:25,708 --> 00:49:27,582
- I'll be there.
- Promise?

702
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:29,537
I said I'd be there, and I will.

703
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:32,339
- Alright.
- This is where I get off, good night.

704
00:49:32,798 --> 00:49:35,585
Wait a minute. Don't go away mad.

705
00:49:35,717 --> 00:49:39,845
Can't we walk and get friendly,
or better acquainted, or something?

706
00:49:39,971 --> 00:49:42,426
No, thanks. I've got to go to bed.

707
00:49:42,557 --> 00:49:46,554
I don't want you spending
your life retouching my pictures.

708
00:49:46,685 --> 00:49:48,428
You are mad, aren't you?

709
00:49:50,439 --> 00:49:52,265
No, I'm not mad, I...

710
00:49:54,192 --> 00:49:57,276
I'm hurt, and disappointed, and...

711
00:49:58,738 --> 00:49:59,936
..and mad.

712
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,250

(chatter)

740
00:55:00,093 --> 00:55:02,216
What are they doing?
They've been in there for hours!

741
00:55:02,345 --> 00:55:04,384
There was a lot to be done.

742
00:55:05,765 --> 00:55:08,884
- They don't look happy.
- They don't look unhappy.

743
00:55:10,811 --> 00:55:12,934
I can't tell. Do they look pleased?

744
00:55:13,063 --> 00:55:16,017
- They don't look displeased.
- (Duval) Everyone.

745
00:55:16,149 --> 00:55:18,437
- Maybe this is the grand finale.
- I'm getting nervous.

746
00:55:18,568 --> 00:55:20,809
- You should.
- Sit down.

747
00:55:20,945 --> 00:55:26,531
My friends, you saw enter here a waif,
a gamin, a IowIy caterpillar.

748
00:55:27,409 --> 00:55:31,109
We open the cocoon but
it is not a butterfly that emerges.

749
00:55:31,246 --> 00:55:36,156
- It's not?
- No, it is a bird of paradise.

750
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:38,247
Lights!

751
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:41,541
Curtain!

752
00:56:01,898 --> 00:56:03,096
Oh...

753
00:56:29,798 --> 00:56:33,547
- Beautiful! I don't believe it.
- Maggie, what did I tell you?

754
00:56:33,678 --> 00:56:36,464
You look absolutely fabulous.
How does it feel?

755
00:56:36,597 --> 00:56:38,720
It feels wonderful, but it's not me.

756
00:56:38,849 --> 00:56:41,386
The hair, the dress. It's perfection.

757
00:56:41,518 --> 00:56:44,139
You see how much we accomplish
when you appear?

758
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:48,647
Try to stay with us for a while.
Duval shows the collection on Friday.

759
00:56:48,774 --> 00:56:51,561
The night before,
we'll introduce you to the press.

760
00:56:51,694 --> 00:56:54,564
It is your great opportunity.
It will be your evening.

761
00:56:54,696 --> 00:56:56,854
- You will be there?
- Yes, of course.

762
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:59,481
Dick, that gives you a week
to photograph her.

763
00:56:59,617 --> 00:57:02,820
I want marvelous pictures.
Give me a lot of pizzazz.

764
00:57:02,954 --> 00:57:06,654
Take her, and whatever you do,
don't let her out of your sight.

765
00:57:07,499 --> 00:57:09,990
Now, just do what I tell you.
Don't worry about it.

766
00:57:10,127 --> 00:57:14,290
Now here, hold these balloons high
in the air, and when I say "run",

767
00:57:14,422 --> 00:57:17,755
run as fast as you can
and don't let the balloons go.

768
00:57:17,884 --> 00:57:20,505
Run as fast as I can
and don't let the balloons go.

769
00:57:20,678 --> 00:57:22,966
Right. Now, ready?

770
00:57:23,097 --> 00:57:26,097
Head up a little. You're so happy.

771
00:57:26,224 --> 00:57:27,802
Alright, run!

772
00:57:27,934 --> 00:57:29,132
Run!

773
00:57:29,269 --> 00:57:31,178
What? Oh, why did I ever...

774
00:57:31,854 --> 00:57:34,345
- What's wrong?
- I don't know which way to go.

775
00:57:34,482 --> 00:57:35,940
That way.

776
00:57:36,067 --> 00:57:39,186
I'm sorry, I'm terribly nervous.
I've never done anything like this.

777
00:57:39,319 --> 00:57:43,186
There's nothing to be nervous about.
You're in Paris, the Tuileries.

778
00:57:43,323 --> 00:57:47,237
You've got balloons. There's
a sudden shower. You're very happy.

779
00:57:47,368 --> 00:57:50,073
- Why am I so happy?
- Because I say you are.

780
00:57:51,705 --> 00:57:54,825
That's all you have to know.
You're happy. Now, run!

781
00:57:56,084 --> 00:57:57,282
Great. That's great.

782
00:57:57,419 --> 00:57:58,617
Now, stop!

783
00:57:59,629 --> 00:58:00,827
Wonderful!

784
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:11,387
Now listen closely, today you're not happy.

785
00:58:11,515 --> 00:58:14,006
- I'm hurt and...
- Right, now you're a creature of tragedy.

786
00:58:14,142 --> 00:58:17,226
Heartbroken, suffering.
You're Anna Karenina.

787
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:19,597
Shall I throw myself under the train?

788
00:58:19,731 --> 00:58:24,107
We'll see. For now, just wonderful,
noble self-sacrifice.

789
00:58:24,485 --> 00:58:26,940
Your lover
has just kissed you goodbye.

790
00:58:30,407 --> 00:58:33,194
You may never know that kiss again,
or love again.

791
00:58:33,326 --> 00:58:35,652
Marcel, put some tears in her eyes.

792
00:58:38,623 --> 00:58:40,415
There are tears in her eyes.

793
00:58:40,542 --> 00:58:43,377
Good. You're not only a model,
you're an actress.

794
00:58:43,503 --> 00:58:49,125
Jo, give me the works.
Heartbreak, longing, tragedy.

795
00:58:49,258 --> 00:58:50,882
Wet your lips.

796
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,132
Good. Alright. Now, la steam!

797
00:58:54,262 --> 00:58:55,258
La steam!

798
00:58:55,388 --> 00:58:57,760
That's great. Just like the movie.

799
00:58:57,891 --> 00:58:59,764
Poor Anna Karenina.

800
00:58:59,892 --> 00:59:01,470
No, not too much steam.

801
00:59:01,602 --> 00:59:05,682
Cut down the steam.
That's wonderful. That's it.

802
00:59:08,775 --> 00:59:13,152
Good. Now give her some flowers.
Flowers. Arms full.

803
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:16,280
Alright. More. More. More!

804
00:59:16,657 --> 00:59:19,230
Alright, Jo, it's spring.
You're in love.

805
00:59:19,368 --> 00:59:22,369
Now, turn around. Fabulous!

806
00:59:29,627 --> 00:59:31,916
(Tristan und Isolde by Wagner)

807
00:59:37,009 --> 00:59:39,167
Now, you're walking out of the opera,

808
00:59:39,303 --> 00:59:42,256
leaving to the lush passionate
music of Tristan and Isolde.

809
00:59:42,389 --> 00:59:44,714
- You're very unhappy.
- What happened now?

810
00:59:44,849 --> 00:59:46,925
A rendezvous at the opera.
Two seats.

811
00:59:47,059 --> 00:59:49,052
He didn't show up. You're furious.

812
00:59:49,186 --> 00:59:53,515
When I say go, walk down with fire
in your eyes and murder on your mind.

813
00:59:53,649 --> 00:59:54,847
Wet your lips.

814
00:59:55,275 --> 00:59:59,107
You're Isolde. You're a queen.
Now, go, go, go!

815
01:00:00,363 --> 01:00:02,901
You're furious at Tristan.

816
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:04,656
That's great.

817
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:18,250
(horn blows)

818
01:00:18,379 --> 01:00:20,537
Today,
you're just a simple little girl.

819
01:00:20,673 --> 01:00:24,504
You live on the Seine river, and you're
trying to catch a fish for your lunch.

820
01:00:25,636 --> 01:00:28,672
Jo, fish! I want you
to look like you're fishing.

821
01:00:28,805 --> 01:00:31,592
I'm trying,
but I've never fished before.

822
01:00:31,724 --> 01:00:35,508
That's quite obvious. You might
just as well be flying a kite.

823
01:00:36,646 --> 01:00:38,603
Don't look like such an amateur.

824
01:00:38,773 --> 01:00:40,184
You're just not fishing!

825
01:00:40,316 --> 01:00:43,400
I am, but it's caught on something.

826
01:00:43,528 --> 01:00:45,899
Well, give it a yank.

827
01:00:46,030 --> 01:00:48,069
Pretend you caught a fish.
Pull it out.

828
01:00:49,575 --> 01:00:51,152
Marvelous!

829
01:00:54,788 --> 01:00:59,449
- Here's what I want you to be.
- I know. I'm a princess at a ball.

830
01:00:59,584 --> 01:01:03,830
The bird is really Prince Charming,
turned into a bird by a wicked sorcerer.

831
01:01:03,962 --> 01:01:06,536
But we've decided
not to let it spoil the ball

832
01:01:06,673 --> 01:01:09,674
and to go on dancing
as if nothing had happened.

833
01:01:09,801 --> 01:01:11,425
You've outgrown me.

834
01:01:12,512 --> 01:01:15,631
Alright. Now, give him a kiss.

835
01:01:16,098 --> 01:01:19,514
He's your Prince Charming, isn't he?
Well, get happy!

836
01:01:20,644 --> 01:01:22,055
That's a killer.

837
01:01:26,483 --> 01:01:28,890
Alright, Marcel, lights!

838
01:01:32,154 --> 01:01:35,025
Jo! Jo, where are you?

839
01:01:36,074 --> 01:01:38,779
Tell me when you're ready. Say "go".

840
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:41,152
I'm ready. What are you gonna do?

841
01:01:41,287 --> 01:01:44,656
Never mind what I'm going to do.
Just say "go".

842
01:01:45,416 --> 01:01:46,744
Alright. Go!

843
01:01:50,254 --> 01:01:53,420
Holy Moses! You look fabulous!

844
01:01:53,548 --> 01:01:54,746
Look, stop.

845
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:56,665
Stop!

846
01:01:56,801 --> 01:02:01,048
- I can't stop. Take the picture.
- Stop!

847
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:05,094
I don't want to stop. I like it.
Take the picture.

848
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:17,818
(children singing)

849
01:02:25,911 --> 01:02:29,445
Alright, this is your wedding day,
the happiest day of your life.

850
01:02:29,581 --> 01:02:32,914
Bells are ringing, flowers blooming,
angels singing.

851
01:02:33,042 --> 01:02:37,538
The man you love more than anyone
is inside the church waiting for you.

852
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:40,500
What's the matter?

853
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:44,586
I just feel so dishonest standing
here in this wedding dress.

854
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:49,049
It's not the happiest day of my life.
And there's no one's waiting for me anywhere.

855
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:53,310
But you weren't Anna Karenina.
The bird wasn't Prince Charming.

856
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,761
- Please, Dick.
- I don't understand.

857
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:57,521
Yes, I know.

858
01:02:57,648 --> 01:03:00,104
Oh, mais quelle mariée charmante!

859
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:03,685
On ne m'avaitpas dit qu'ily aurait
un mariage aujourd'hui.

860
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:04,935
Mais entrez donc.

861
01:03:05,072 --> 01:03:07,147
I'm afraid you got us wrong Padre,
we're not here to get married.

862
01:03:07,282 --> 01:03:11,030
- Such a beautiful bride.
- This is not my dress.

863
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,868
We're here to take some pictures.

864
01:03:12,995 --> 01:03:17,040
Nous sommes ici pour photographie,
pour la magazine de la fashion.

865
01:03:17,166 --> 01:03:20,415
I'm sorry. Perhaps we should've
asked your permission first.

866
01:03:20,544 --> 01:03:23,544
No wedding? Aah, quel dommage!

867
01:03:23,671 --> 01:03:25,213
Merci.

868
01:03:26,549 --> 01:03:27,545
Jo!

869
01:03:32,888 --> 01:03:34,465
Jo?

870
01:03:37,517 --> 01:03:40,850
I'm terribly sorry. I don't know
what's the matter with me.

871
01:03:40,979 --> 01:03:44,561
Forget it and relax.
We've been working too hard.

872
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:47,181
I suppose we'll be going home soon?

873
01:03:47,318 --> 01:03:49,191
That's it. You're probably homesick.

874
01:03:49,319 --> 01:03:53,364
Well, just this last picture,
then you'll be through.

875
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:56,609
- And then what happens?
- We go home.

876
01:03:57,327 --> 01:03:58,358
And then?

877
01:03:59,203 --> 01:04:00,614
What do you mean?

878
01:04:00,746 --> 01:04:02,537
Will I see you any more?

879
01:04:02,665 --> 01:04:05,998
And how! If you model, I can get you
all the bookings you can handle

880
01:04:06,126 --> 01:04:09,577
- We'd be working together every day.
- I'll model.

881
01:04:09,713 --> 01:04:11,670
Good. We'll put you to work right now.

882
01:04:11,798 --> 01:04:15,297
Stand here, please.
There's a good place. Fine.

883
01:04:18,762 --> 01:04:19,758
Lovely.

884
01:04:19,888 --> 01:04:22,842
Now, tip your head just a little bit.

885
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:26,175
Good. A little smile.

886
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:30,059
Jo.

887
01:04:32,108 --> 01:04:33,139
Yes?

888
01:04:34,068 --> 01:04:35,645
Something is wrong.

889
01:04:36,612 --> 01:04:38,319
No. Why?

890
01:04:38,447 --> 01:04:41,117
You're the saddest looking
bride I've ever seen.

891
01:04:41,242 --> 01:04:43,483
You look as if you've been jilted.

892
01:04:43,619 --> 01:04:45,695
This is your wedding day.

893
01:04:45,829 --> 01:04:49,778
The day you've dreamt of all your life.
You're marrying the man you love.

894
01:04:49,916 --> 01:04:51,873
The man who loves you.

895
01:04:52,919 --> 01:04:54,117
He's the only...

896
01:04:55,213 --> 01:04:56,790
And you're...

897
01:05:05,555 --> 01:05:08,721
Oh Dick, I thought
it would never happen.

898
01:05:10,226 --> 01:05:13,641
I never want to go home.
I love Paris!

899
01:05:13,771 --> 01:05:17,934
I love these clothes and
the little church. And I love you.

900
01:05:21,569 --> 01:05:23,609
What did you say?

901
01:05:23,738 --> 01:05:25,896
I love Paris.

902
01:05:26,032 --> 01:05:27,823
That's not what I heard.

903
01:05:30,619 --> 01:05:32,078
My, my, my...!

904
01:05:34,873 --> 01:05:36,664
Well, what do you know!

905
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:40,127
♫ He loves

906
01:05:41,087 --> 01:05:42,878
♫ And she loves

907
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:45,832
♫ And they love

908
01:05:46,383 --> 01:05:50,795
♫ So why can't... you love

909
01:05:51,179 --> 01:05:56,137
♫ And I love too?

910
01:05:58,853 --> 01:06:00,596
♫ Birds love

911
01:06:00,729 --> 01:06:02,852
♫ And bees love

912
01:06:03,774 --> 01:06:07,522
♫ And whispering trees love

913
01:06:08,445 --> 01:06:10,236
♫ And that's what

914
01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:14,862
♫ We both should do

915
01:06:18,745 --> 01:06:22,790
♫ I aIways knew someday

916
01:06:24,042 --> 01:06:26,829
♫ You'd come along

917
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:31,668
♫ We'll make a twosome

918
01:06:32,549 --> 01:06:36,214
♫ That just can't go wrong

919
01:06:37,179 --> 01:06:39,218
♫ Darling

920
01:06:41,057 --> 01:06:42,885
♫ He loves

921
01:06:43,727 --> 01:06:45,518
♫ And she loves

922
01:06:45,645 --> 01:06:47,934
♫ And they love

923
01:06:48,064 --> 01:06:52,690
♫ So won't you love me

924
01:06:53,653 --> 01:07:00,271
♫ As I love you?

925
01:10:24,759 --> 01:10:27,214
Armande, let me see
a breeze in the trees.

926
01:10:27,344 --> 01:10:30,215
Not too much.
I don't want a cyclone.

927
01:10:30,347 --> 01:10:31,806
Fountains.

928
01:10:33,642 --> 01:10:36,595
It's thrilling!
It makes me cry for the Carolines.

929
01:10:36,728 --> 01:10:39,265
The correspondent from Pakistan
has just accepted.

930
01:10:39,397 --> 01:10:42,433
The correspondent from
Madrid finally will be
able to make it after all.

931
01:10:42,566 --> 01:10:45,602
And the man from the Istanbul
press will be at the presentation.

932
01:10:45,736 --> 01:10:47,694
Good. Now, where on earth is Jo?

933
01:10:48,364 --> 01:10:49,443
Here she is.

934
01:10:49,573 --> 01:10:52,325
Thank heavens.
I thought you'd stand us up again.

935
01:10:52,451 --> 01:10:55,156
- How did the wedding pictures go?
- Wonderfully.

936
01:10:55,287 --> 01:10:57,160
Yes, he's a marvelous photographer.

937
01:10:57,289 --> 01:11:01,368
All you have to do is sit there.
I make my speech to the press,

938
01:11:01,501 --> 01:11:04,418
the curtains will open
and you dazzle 'em!

939
01:11:04,545 --> 01:11:06,870
- Give 'em the old pizzazz.
- I'll try.

940
01:11:07,006 --> 01:11:09,331
Afterward, I will introduce
you to them personally.

941
01:11:09,466 --> 01:11:11,755
Be charming and answer
all of their questions.

942
01:11:11,885 --> 01:11:15,301
- Well, what sort of questions?
- It's remarkably simple.

943
01:11:15,430 --> 01:11:17,837
I've been written editorials
on it for years.

944
01:11:17,974 --> 01:11:19,717
As one lady to another...

945
01:11:19,851 --> 01:11:22,472
We ought to look like
one lady to another.

946
01:11:22,603 --> 01:11:25,176
They'll want to know
who does your hair,

947
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:28,231
what you eat, drink,
what sheets you sleep on.

948
01:11:28,358 --> 01:11:31,312
You're the authority
on how to be lovely.

949
01:11:31,444 --> 01:11:33,271
What am I going to tell them?

950
01:11:33,404 --> 01:11:35,527
Just listen and repeat after me.

951
01:11:36,365 --> 01:11:39,485
♫ On how to be lovely

952
01:11:39,618 --> 01:11:42,738
♫ You gotta be happy

953
01:11:42,871 --> 01:11:44,863
♫ When you can feel light and gay

954
01:11:44,998 --> 01:11:48,782
♫ Then you'll be lovely as a holiday

955
01:11:49,085 --> 01:11:52,002
♫ On how to be charming

956
01:11:52,213 --> 01:11:55,000
♫ You gotta be merry

957
01:11:55,132 --> 01:11:57,421
♫ If only to weave a spell

958
01:11:57,551 --> 01:12:02,212
♫ And you'll be
lovely as a carousel, too

959
01:12:03,890 --> 01:12:06,760
♫ I know you can show how

960
01:12:06,893 --> 01:12:09,727
♫ It's all in the know-how

961
01:12:09,853 --> 01:12:12,890
♫ And once you know, oh how

962
01:12:13,023 --> 01:12:14,647
♫ The world looks good to you

963
01:12:14,775 --> 01:12:16,684
♫ As it should to you

964
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:20,147
♫ On how to be lovely

965
01:12:20,279 --> 01:12:23,482
♫ You gotta be jolly

966
01:12:23,616 --> 01:12:25,276
♫ When you can be fancy-free

967
01:12:25,743 --> 01:12:30,203
♫ And flash a smile that folks
come flocking to see

968
01:12:32,666 --> 01:12:36,248
♫ You'll be as lovely as can be

969
01:13:06,447 --> 01:13:09,447
♫ Can't do it with make-up

970
01:13:09,574 --> 01:13:12,148
♫ You just gotta wake up

971
01:13:12,994 --> 01:13:15,366
♫ And starting to take up

972
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:17,158
♫ The life delirious

973
01:13:17,582 --> 01:13:19,159
♫ Nothing serious

974
01:13:19,708 --> 01:13:22,911
♫ On how to be lovely

975
01:13:23,045 --> 01:13:25,666
♫ You gotta be cheery

976
01:13:25,797 --> 01:13:28,086
♫ I'll give you a guarantee

977
01:13:28,216 --> 01:13:30,007
♫ You don't need dough

978
01:13:30,134 --> 01:13:33,135
♫ You don't need a college degree

979
01:13:35,056 --> 01:13:38,424
♫ Make sorrow incidental

980
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:41,096
♫ Let joy be monumental

981
01:13:41,228 --> 01:13:45,723
♫ And you'll be lovely

982
01:13:52,279 --> 01:13:55,778
♫ You'll be as lovely as can be

983
01:14:08,419 --> 01:14:10,494
Ah, beautiful!

984
01:14:11,672 --> 01:14:13,249
Beautiful!

985
01:14:13,381 --> 01:14:14,959
These are not my clothes.

986
01:14:15,091 --> 01:14:18,709
They were Ient me for tonight.
I'm being presented to the press.

987
01:14:18,845 --> 01:14:21,845
Alors! Your picture will be
in all the newspapers?

988
01:14:21,972 --> 01:14:22,968
Oh, yes.

989
01:14:23,098 --> 01:14:26,134
And they'll ask me
all sorts of questions.

990
01:14:26,268 --> 01:14:27,382
Oh!

991
01:14:27,519 --> 01:14:31,599
I think perhaps you had better stay
here with me, huh?

992
01:14:32,649 --> 01:14:33,644
Hello!

993
01:14:36,068 --> 01:14:38,524
Don't you remember me?
Jo Stockton?

994
01:14:38,654 --> 01:14:39,982
C'est Jo!

995
01:14:40,114 --> 01:14:43,482
On vous a manquée, mais on n'a pas
le temps de s'arréter maintenant.

996
01:14:43,617 --> 01:14:46,487
Flostre part au café
et on est déjé en retard. Au revoir.

997
01:14:46,619 --> 01:14:49,620
What were they saying about Flostre?

998
01:14:49,747 --> 01:14:53,959
That he is speaking at the café
and that they are late.

999
01:15:07,139 --> 01:15:09,380
Mr Avery will be by in five minutes.

1000
01:15:09,516 --> 01:15:12,007
Will you ask him to pick me up at the cafe?

1001
01:15:18,774 --> 01:15:20,482
Vous retrouverez tout cela

1002
01:15:20,609 --> 01:15:22,317
Á travers tous mes écrits
sur l'empathicalisme.

1003
01:15:22,444 --> 01:15:25,361
La spiritualité
inhérente á I'empathicalisme

1004
01:15:25,488 --> 01:15:29,652
matérialise les plus nobles aspects
de la nature humaine.

1005
01:15:29,784 --> 01:15:31,741
Consciemment ou inconsciemment,

1006
01:15:31,869 --> 01:15:34,739
elle est perceptible
dans tout ce qui nous touche.

1007
01:15:34,872 --> 01:15:39,414
Dans nos meilleures sculptures...
Et dans notre meilleure littérature.

1008
01:15:48,801 --> 01:15:50,176
Pardon, monsieur.

1009
01:15:50,302 --> 01:15:53,173
Je suis... terribly sorry.

1010
01:15:53,305 --> 01:15:55,878
- I...
- Quite alright, mademoiselle.

1011
01:15:56,016 --> 01:15:57,214
You're quite welcome.

1012
01:16:00,853 --> 01:16:04,518
Etudiez la statue un instant.
Je reviens tout de suite.

1013
01:16:08,235 --> 01:16:09,812
Now, mademoiselle.

1014
01:16:09,945 --> 01:16:12,945
I can't believe it.
I thought you'd be old!

1015
01:16:13,073 --> 01:16:15,777
Well, I mean, a philosopher
and professor.

1016
01:16:15,908 --> 01:16:18,909
It all suggests age.
I mean, maturity.

1017
01:16:19,036 --> 01:16:21,029
I'm afraid I've disappointed you.

1018
01:16:21,163 --> 01:16:25,741
Not at all. There's no reason why someone
brilliant shouldn't be young.

1019
01:16:26,835 --> 01:16:29,539
I find myself
at an awkward disadvantage.

1020
01:16:31,047 --> 01:16:33,086
You know who I am.

1021
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:38,378
But except that you are
very charming, I don't know you.

1022
01:16:38,512 --> 01:16:42,343
I'm so excited about meeting you,
I forgot to introduce myself.

1023
01:16:42,474 --> 01:16:45,677
If only you knew how anxious
I am to talk to you.

1024
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:48,645
I came from New York
just to see you!

1025
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:52,720
You couldn't have a more loyal
disciple of empathicalism than I.

1026
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:57,236
- Than whom?
- I'm sorry. I'm Jo Stockton.

1027
01:16:58,072 --> 01:17:01,108
I'm enchanted,... Miss Stockton.

1028
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:07,619
And since you've come such a long way
to talk with me,

1029
01:17:07,747 --> 01:17:10,238
by all means, let's talk.

1030
01:17:16,338 --> 01:17:18,876
(Jo) ..there's so much
you can teach us.

1031
01:17:19,007 --> 01:17:21,000
(Flostre) I may go next year.

1032
01:17:21,134 --> 01:17:24,669
You must see Greenwich Village.
It's our Left Bank.

1033
01:17:24,804 --> 01:17:28,089
People there think, and do things.
Useful things.

1034
01:17:28,224 --> 01:17:31,225
- Do you live in Greenwich Village?
- Of course.

1035
01:17:31,352 --> 01:17:35,515
Then I will certainly come. Perhaps we
can do useful things together.

1036
01:17:35,647 --> 01:17:39,098
I'm sure that in all America
there's no empathicalist

1037
01:17:39,234 --> 01:17:40,858
as charming as you.

1038
01:17:40,985 --> 01:17:43,310
Well, I hate to throw
a wet blanket...

1039
01:17:43,446 --> 01:17:46,400
Darling, guess who this is.
You'll never guess!

1040
01:17:46,532 --> 01:17:49,201
- Your brother?
- Professor Flostre.

1041
01:17:49,326 --> 01:17:53,904
- This is Dick Avery.
- Professor? I thought you'd be old.

1042
01:17:54,039 --> 01:17:57,123
- So did I. Aren't you surprised?
- I'm overcome.

1043
01:17:57,250 --> 01:18:01,081
For you, my dear,
I promise never to grow old.

1044
01:18:01,212 --> 01:18:03,619
- Come on, Jo.
- What's the matter?

1045
01:18:03,756 --> 01:18:05,547
We've got to get over to Duval's.

1046
01:18:05,674 --> 01:18:08,544
Must you go so soon?
I was just beginning to know you.

1047
01:18:08,677 --> 01:18:11,880
Couldn't I stay?
The professor wants to talk to me.

1048
01:18:12,013 --> 01:18:15,547
- You've heard it all before.
- Have you lost your mind?

1049
01:18:15,683 --> 01:18:18,637
- We'll talk about that later.
- What are you doing?

1050
01:18:18,769 --> 01:18:21,770
I've never been so humiliated
in all my life!

1051
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:25,100
What's got into you?
Have you any idea...

1052
01:18:28,987 --> 01:18:31,062
How could you be so rude?

1053
01:18:31,197 --> 01:18:34,032
Embarrassing me
in front of Professor Flostre!

1054
01:18:34,158 --> 01:18:36,399
What am I going to tell him?

1055
01:18:36,535 --> 01:18:40,781
You're not gonna tell him anything.
You'll never see him again.

1056
01:18:40,914 --> 01:18:44,080
- Not going to see him again?
- That's what I said.

1057
01:18:44,208 --> 01:18:46,331
Now, just a moment...

1058
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:49,876
I went through all this nonsense
to meet this man.

1059
01:18:50,005 --> 01:18:51,630
So I could talk to him.

1060
01:18:53,467 --> 01:18:57,216
I worship everything he stands for.
The way he thinks.

1061
01:18:57,346 --> 01:19:00,133
You might as well tell me
never to eat again.

1062
01:19:00,933 --> 01:19:04,183
The man from Herald Tribune has brought
a correspondent from Sweden.

1063
01:19:04,311 --> 01:19:06,552
- The more the merrier.
- They are here, Miss Prescott.

1064
01:19:06,688 --> 01:19:09,226
Get them quiet, Duval.
I'll be right back.

1065
01:19:09,357 --> 01:19:13,354
When a man looks at a woman
the way Flostre looks at you,
it doesn't take any imagination...

1066
01:19:13,486 --> 01:19:15,525
(all speak at once)

1067
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:22,318
If you weren't so serious,
this would be terribly funny.

1068
01:19:22,452 --> 01:19:25,287
I'll check the lights,
then I make my speech.

1069
01:19:25,413 --> 01:19:26,788
Everybody, ready!

1070
01:19:26,914 --> 01:19:28,823
Flostre may be the
quiz kid of the centure,

1071
01:19:28,958 --> 01:19:31,793
the greatest philosopher
since Aristotle.

1072
01:19:31,919 --> 01:19:35,418
But he's also a man.
He's more man than philosopher!

1073
01:19:35,547 --> 01:19:38,548
Are you suggesting that
Flostre's interest in me is
anything but intellectual?

1074
01:19:38,675 --> 01:19:41,166
He's as interested in your intellect
as I am.

1075
01:19:41,302 --> 01:19:42,465
(fanfare)

1076
01:19:42,595 --> 01:19:45,679
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,
my friends.

1077
01:19:45,806 --> 01:19:49,673
I have asked you here to meet
the woman selected to represent

1078
01:19:49,810 --> 01:19:53,937
the most discriminating
publication in the world, Quality.

1079
01:19:54,064 --> 01:19:56,471
Let's forget it
and get this over with.

1080
01:19:56,607 --> 01:19:57,722
Forget it?

1081
01:19:57,859 --> 01:20:01,192
Attack Flostre and you attack
the things I believe in.

1082
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:04,274
We're fortunate to have found out
these things now.

1083
01:20:04,406 --> 01:20:06,861
I'm certain you'll not be
disappointed.

1084
01:20:06,992 --> 01:20:10,158
She is a rare creature...
chosen from hundreds

1085
01:20:10,286 --> 01:20:13,869
for her appearance, her grace,
her poise...

1086
01:20:13,998 --> 01:20:16,868
and her ineffable charm.

1087
01:20:17,001 --> 01:20:19,456
We can never
reconcile our differences.

1088
01:20:19,586 --> 01:20:21,246
They are too basic and too elemental.

1089
01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:24,546
This is not the time or place
to discuss our differences.

1090
01:20:24,674 --> 01:20:26,583
Please, let's get this show on.

1091
01:20:26,718 --> 01:20:29,802
Yes, the show! Our personal lives
couldn't matter less, could they?

1092
01:20:29,929 --> 01:20:33,712
- Would you please sit down?
- Leave me alone!

1093
01:20:37,769 --> 01:20:40,604
May I present the Quality Woman!

1094
01:20:40,730 --> 01:20:42,769
(fanfare)

1095
01:21:12,968 --> 01:21:15,541
(Miss Prescott)
What does that one say?

1096
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:19,379
All of them say the same thing.
Everyone in Paris is laughing.

1097
01:21:19,516 --> 01:21:22,801
- I'm not.
- I should think you wouldn't be,
this is all your fault.

1098
01:21:22,935 --> 01:21:26,719
I know. I said some things last
night I shouldn't have said. She got upset.

1099
01:21:26,856 --> 01:21:29,975
- Just a lovers' quarrel.
- A what?

1100
01:21:30,109 --> 01:21:33,062
- You mean, you and that girl...
- Why not?

1101
01:21:33,195 --> 01:21:35,483
Impossible!
You're in the fashion world.

1102
01:21:35,613 --> 01:21:38,318
We're cold, artificial
and without sentiment.

1103
01:21:38,449 --> 01:21:41,699
- How can you possibly be in love?
- I'm a black sheep.

1104
01:21:41,827 --> 01:21:45,161
What about my collection?
Without her I cannot show it.

1105
01:21:45,289 --> 01:21:48,408
- The gowns were sewn on her!
- I'm facing ruin!

1106
01:21:48,542 --> 01:21:51,115
Don't worry, she'll show up.
The girl has integrity.

1107
01:21:51,252 --> 01:21:55,250
She's filled with virtues.
Only she's not wasting them on us.

1108
01:21:55,381 --> 01:21:57,836
I went to the cafe, but she isn't there.

1109
01:21:57,967 --> 01:21:59,046
So where is she?

1110
01:21:59,176 --> 01:22:02,046
She's at her hotel,
but she won't take messages.

1111
01:22:02,179 --> 01:22:06,342
So I bribed the desk clerk into
letting me copy her phone messages.

1112
01:22:07,934 --> 01:22:11,137
"At 10:15, Dick Avery called."

1113
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:13,843
"At 11:30, Dick Avery called."

1114
01:22:15,232 --> 01:22:18,850
"At 12:16, Professor Flostre called."

1115
01:22:20,028 --> 01:22:22,649
Lousy, rotten good-for-nothing!

1116
01:22:24,199 --> 01:22:27,982
"Having an evening of international
philosophy, poetry,

1117
01:22:28,119 --> 01:22:30,954
song and meditation tonight
at my salon."

1118
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:35,373
"Would be delighted if you would
join us. Emile Flostre."

1119
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:37,623
Obviously, that's where she'll be tonight.

1120
01:22:37,752 --> 01:22:39,910
Not showing my collection.
I'm ruined.

1121
01:22:40,046 --> 01:22:42,797
I'll go to Flostre's tonight
and bring her back.

1122
01:22:42,924 --> 01:22:46,506
And take someone who isn't
emotionally involved. Like me.

1123
01:22:46,635 --> 01:22:47,880
You'll never get in.

1124
01:22:48,011 --> 01:22:51,961
Empathicalists have a very firm
way of dealing with what they
call hostile vibrations.

1125
01:22:52,098 --> 01:22:54,969
Let's turn into
a couple of friendly vibrations.

1126
01:22:55,101 --> 01:22:58,552
Until we get in. As they say,
if you can't lick 'em, join 'em.

1127
01:23:07,947 --> 01:23:10,947
- Do I look grubby enough?
- Yeah. How's the beard?

1128
01:23:11,075 --> 01:23:13,151
- Full of pizzazz.
- Come on.

1129
01:23:16,538 --> 01:23:18,198
Oui? Qui est vous?

1130
01:23:18,331 --> 01:23:20,904
Nous sommes voyager ici
pour la meditation.

1131
01:23:21,042 --> 01:23:22,322
Quels noms?

1132
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:23,456
La.

1133
01:23:23,586 --> 01:23:26,954
Ah! Monsieur et Madame Barker
de Florida.

1134
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:30,876
- Florida.
- That's us. De Tallahassee.

1135
01:23:31,009 --> 01:23:32,468
Bon. Entrez.

1136
01:23:32,594 --> 01:23:34,882
- Come on, sugar.
- Alright, darlin'.

1137
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:41,555
- Où est Flostre?
- Pourquoi?

1138
01:23:41,685 --> 01:23:43,761
I don't know. I just asked.

1139
01:23:48,566 --> 01:23:51,650
♫ On me demande

1140
01:23:51,778 --> 01:23:54,695
- (woman sobs)
- ♫ Pourquois l'ai tué

1141
01:23:54,822 --> 01:23:56,482
C'est triste!

1142
01:23:56,615 --> 01:23:59,782
- What's the matter?
- The song's a bundle of laughs.

1143
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:06,030
♫ Un moment de passion engageante
Je le détestais

1144
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:08,870
She stabbed her lover
because she hated him.

1145
01:24:09,001 --> 01:24:11,575
♫ Mais quande l'ai vu

1146
01:24:12,546 --> 01:24:16,211
♫ Mort, froid, et massacré

1147
01:24:16,341 --> 01:24:19,176
Now that the poor thing is dead...

1148
01:24:19,302 --> 01:24:24,213
♫ Tout d'un coup, je savais bien
Que je l'ai aimé

1149
01:24:24,348 --> 01:24:26,756
Now that he's dead, she loves him.

1150
01:24:27,935 --> 01:24:29,844
♫ Ma téte éclate

1151
01:24:30,521 --> 01:24:35,431
♫ Je suis complétement dérangée

1152
01:24:35,567 --> 01:24:38,402
This kid's a little confused.

1153
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:40,650
♫ Et maintenant

1154
01:24:40,780 --> 01:24:43,068
♫ Il n'y a plus rien

1155
01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:45,274
♫ Il n'y a qu'un seul reméde

1156
01:24:45,409 --> 01:24:47,069
Now she's gonna get even.

1157
01:24:47,202 --> 01:24:50,737
- ♫ Je vais mejeter sur la rue
- She's gonna kill herself.

1158

- C'est tragique!
- You can say that again.

1161
01:25:01,131 --> 01:25:02,045
Hey!

1162
01:25:07,638 --> 01:25:09,180
Look up the airstay.

1163
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:13,678
We're on the wrong floor.

1164
01:25:13,810 --> 01:25:15,435
Un moment, s'il vous plaît.

1165
01:25:15,562 --> 01:25:18,598
Suivez moi.
Il me semble qu'ily a une erreur.

1166
01:25:18,731 --> 01:25:21,518
Ily a un autre couple
qui s'appelle Barker de Florida.

1167
01:25:21,651 --> 01:25:23,726
Oh-oh, the real Barkers.

1168
01:25:23,861 --> 01:25:25,569
Now what's this all about?

1169
01:25:26,321 --> 01:25:30,698
- They are not from Tallahassee!
- They ain't even from Miami.

1170
01:25:30,825 --> 01:25:33,530
I've never seen these people
in Tallahassee,

1171
01:25:33,661 --> 01:25:36,911
and I have been in every corner
of Tallahassee.

1172
01:25:37,039 --> 01:25:40,704
- Is this some sort of a gag?
- I know who he is!

1173
01:25:40,834 --> 01:25:44,535
- Il est un photographer de fashion.
- Fashion?!

1174
01:25:44,671 --> 01:25:47,292
She's a fashion editor.
Get 'em out!

1175
01:25:47,424 --> 01:25:50,175
At once,
or Mr Flostre will hear about this.

1176
01:25:50,301 --> 01:25:53,836
Now, wait, we're spiritual singers
on a tour and...

1177
01:25:53,971 --> 01:25:56,544
Now the hostile vibrations
have gone...

1178
01:25:56,682 --> 01:25:58,805
Attendez!
We are ready for your show.

1179
01:26:00,018 --> 01:26:03,718
- Command performance!
- Come on, Mama. We're on.

1180
01:26:03,855 --> 01:26:05,894
Let's give 'em the old pizzazz.

♫ Don't know where-a

♫ All we know is

1186
01:26:25,082 --> 01:26:27,122
♫ It's up there-a

1187
01:26:27,918 --> 01:26:30,207
♫ Somehow we gotta

1188
01:26:30,337 --> 01:26:33,041
♫ Climb that stair-a

1189
01:26:34,215 --> 01:26:36,374
♫ Ring-a dem...

1190
01:26:36,759 --> 01:26:38,799
♫ Ring-a dem...

1191
01:26:39,303 --> 01:26:41,379
♫ Bells

1192
01:26:41,514 --> 01:26:42,593
(rings)

1193
01:26:42,723 --> 01:26:44,762
(music moves up tempo)

1194
01:26:44,892 --> 01:26:47,596
♫ Come, all you children,
gather around

1195
01:26:47,727 --> 01:26:49,519
♫ Gather around, you children!

1196
01:26:49,646 --> 01:26:54,272
♫ And we will lose
that evil spirit called voodoo

1197
01:26:57,486 --> 01:27:00,024
♫ Nothing but trouble
If he's found you

1198
01:27:00,155 --> 01:27:01,946
♫ If he has found you, children

1199
01:27:02,074 --> 01:27:04,031
♫ But you can chase that hoodoo

1200
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:06,567
♫ With the dance that you do

1201
01:27:10,290 --> 01:27:14,868
♫ Let us lead the way

1202
01:27:15,962 --> 01:27:21,204
♫ Jubilee today

1203
01:27:21,342 --> 01:27:25,386
♫ He'll never hound you,
step on the ground you...

1204
01:27:25,512 --> 01:27:26,543
♫ Children!

1205
01:27:31,351 --> 01:27:32,596
♫ Clap your hands

1206
01:27:32,727 --> 01:27:33,841
♫ Slap your thighs

1207
01:27:33,978 --> 01:27:35,602
♫ Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

1208
01:27:35,730 --> 01:27:37,769
♫ Everybody come along

1209
01:27:37,898 --> 01:27:40,270
♫ And join the jubilee!

1210
01:27:40,984 --> 01:27:42,229
♫ Clap your hands

1211
01:27:42,361 --> 01:27:43,605
♫ Slap your thighs

1212
01:27:43,737 --> 01:27:45,147
♫ Don't you lose time,
don't you lose time

1213
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:47,486
♫ Come along
And shake your shoes time

1214
01:27:47,615 --> 01:27:50,699
♫ Now for you and me

1215
01:27:50,910 --> 01:27:52,285
♫ On the sands of time

1216
01:27:52,411 --> 01:27:55,365
♫ You're only a pebble

1217
01:27:55,497 --> 01:27:59,364
♫ Remember trouble must be
treated just like a rebel

1218
01:27:59,501 --> 01:28:00,746
♫ Send it to the devil

1219
01:28:00,877 --> 01:28:02,122
♫ Clap your hands

1220
01:28:02,253 --> 01:28:03,451
♫ Slap your thighs

1221
01:28:03,588 --> 01:28:05,165
♫ Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

1222
01:28:05,298 --> 01:28:10,292
♫ Everybody come along
and join the jubilee!

1223
01:28:10,427 --> 01:28:12,835
♫ So ring-a dem bells

1224
01:28:12,971 --> 01:28:15,213
♫ Ring-a dem bells out

1225
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:18,012
♫ Ring-a them, ring-a them
Ring-a them, ring-a them

1226
01:28:19,018 --> 01:28:20,299
♫ Bells!

1227
01:28:20,436 --> 01:28:23,105
(music moves down tempo)

1228
01:28:24,732 --> 01:28:27,020
Well, Mr Tallahassee, how we doin'?

1229
01:28:27,150 --> 01:28:31,362
Why, we's the two most friendly
vibrations you ever seen.

1230
01:28:31,738 --> 01:28:34,110
♫ Hey, diddle diddle,
the cat and the fiddle.

1231
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:36,279
♫ The dish ran away with the spoon.

1232
01:28:39,370 --> 01:28:42,406
Do you know why
a chicken crosses the road?

1233
01:28:42,539 --> 01:28:44,662
No, why does a chicken
cross the road?

1234
01:28:44,791 --> 01:28:47,496
- Why, to get to the second floor!
- You is a genius!

1235
01:28:47,627 --> 01:28:49,620
♫ Roses are red,
the violets are blue,

1236
01:28:49,754 --> 01:28:54,581
♫ the dresses is gotta be showed.
Let's get this show on the road!

♫ Clap your hands, slap your thighs,
gimme that beat, boy...

1238
01:28:58,762 --> 01:29:01,597
♫ Gimme that, gimme that
crazy knocked-out beat!

1239
01:29:01,723 --> 01:29:04,640
♫ You gotta...

1240
01:29:04,767 --> 01:29:06,511
♫ You gotta clap your hands

1241
01:29:35,212 --> 01:29:38,747
♫ Clap your hands, slap your thighs,
gimme some heat, man!

1242
01:29:38,882 --> 01:29:41,752
♫ Gimme some,
gimme some Dixieland beat!

1243
01:29:41,885 --> 01:29:46,345
♫ When you hear that Dixieland,
you gotta clap your hands

1244
01:29:48,516 --> 01:29:51,682
♫ Clap-a your hands

1245
01:29:51,810 --> 01:29:55,345
♫ Clap-a your hands

1246
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:58,018
♫ Hallelujah!
Hallelu... Hallelu...

1247
01:29:58,149 --> 01:30:00,818
♫ Hallelujah

1248
01:30:01,277 --> 01:30:08,691
♫ Come along and join our jubilee!

1249
01:30:11,578 --> 01:30:13,321
(applause)

1250
01:30:21,003 --> 01:30:24,502
(Jo) Intellectual gratification
is imperatively nonexistent.

1251
01:30:24,631 --> 01:30:29,044
- Only you can fulfill that potential.
- This is it.

1252
01:30:30,261 --> 01:30:33,345
- Flostre, there you are.
- Professor, we need you!

1253
01:30:33,473 --> 01:30:37,173
What are you doing here?
You look ridiculous!

1254
01:30:37,351 --> 01:30:41,051
We've come to see Flostre. Professor,
Maggie and I need guidance.

1255
01:30:41,188 --> 01:30:43,513
We realize what futile aimless lives we lead.

1256
01:30:43,648 --> 01:30:47,183
- When did you realize this?
- Today. At about two o'clock.

1257
01:30:47,318 --> 01:30:50,319
- Just after lunch.
- Professor, don't believe them!

1258
01:30:50,446 --> 01:30:53,067
We want to sit at your feet
and learn.

1259
01:30:53,199 --> 01:30:55,903
We sit at your feet,
humble and ignorant, but so willing.

1260
01:30:56,034 --> 01:30:57,908
You two just leave his feet alone.

1261
01:30:58,036 --> 01:31:00,408
Professor, they want to make
a fool of you.

1262
01:31:00,538 --> 01:31:03,373
- Are you trying to make a fool out of Flostre?
- Who, me?

1263
01:31:03,499 --> 01:31:07,248
You're making things difficult.
You don't own empathicalism.

1264
01:31:07,378 --> 01:31:09,502
It's in the public domain, isn't it?

1265
01:31:09,631 --> 01:31:13,213
- Why don't you trust these people?
- Because I know them well.

1266
01:31:13,342 --> 01:31:16,343
I know what they're here for
and it is not guidance.

1267
01:31:16,470 --> 01:31:18,759
Don't listen to her, master.
She is but a child.

1268
01:31:18,889 --> 01:31:20,798
They came to see me, not you.

1269
01:31:20,933 --> 01:31:23,767
To get me over to Duval's
to model their collection.

1270
01:31:25,478 --> 01:31:28,894
- I should have known.
- You should've heard what he said last night!

1271
01:31:29,023 --> 01:31:32,973
If we'd come a few minutes later,
you'd have found out for yourself.

1272
01:31:33,110 --> 01:31:34,770
You've said enough, Mr Avery.

1273
01:31:34,903 --> 01:31:37,939
Not yet. I haven't told you
what a phony you are.

1274
01:31:38,073 --> 01:31:41,691
- Get out of my house.
- I'm not ready to leave.

1275
01:31:41,826 --> 01:31:44,068
I think I can change your mind.

1276
01:31:44,203 --> 01:31:46,777
- Catch!
- (Jo screams)

1277
01:31:46,914 --> 01:31:48,705
Oh! Oh, no!

1278
01:31:49,541 --> 01:31:53,290
Look what you've done!
Bursting in here like a hoodlum!

1279
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:55,745
- I never touched him.
- Go away!

1280
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:58,667
It's time your waking up
to some of your responsibilities.

1281
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,543
Will you please leave?

1282
01:32:00,676 --> 01:32:03,677
Duval can't show his collection
without you, regardless what you feel about me!

1283
01:32:03,804 --> 01:32:06,377
You can't do this to him,
or to all the other people involved!

1284
01:32:06,515 --> 01:32:07,629
Hundreds of people.

1285
01:32:07,849 --> 01:32:10,008
I'm not interested in your people,
than you are in mine!

1286
01:32:10,143 --> 01:32:14,603
- Your empathy is a little one-sided.
- Get out!

1287
01:32:14,731 --> 01:32:15,810
Alright!

1288
01:32:16,691 --> 01:32:18,517
I assume you mean me, too?

1289
01:32:19,318 --> 01:32:21,524
On you it looks cute, sugar.

1290
01:32:26,741 --> 01:32:28,781
Well, you certainly fixed everything!

1291
01:32:28,910 --> 01:32:32,907
If you can't lick 'em, join 'em
and if you can't join 'em, lick 'em!

1292
01:32:33,039 --> 01:32:35,529
- Tell Duval I'm sorry, we tried.
- Where are you going?

1293
01:32:35,666 --> 01:32:39,200
There's a plane to New York
at 10:30pm and I'm going with it.

1294
01:32:40,045 --> 01:32:42,915
You can't do this to me! Come back!

1295
01:32:43,048 --> 01:32:47,590
How dare you leave me in the street
like this! Taxi!

1296
01:32:58,561 --> 01:33:01,515
- Have they gone?
- They've gone.

1297
01:33:01,648 --> 01:33:04,897
- And you're still here?
- I'm still here.

1298
01:33:05,026 --> 01:33:06,982
Are you alright?

1299
01:33:07,111 --> 01:33:08,273
Well.

1300
01:33:08,987 --> 01:33:12,653
In fact, I feel wonderful.

1301
01:33:14,035 --> 01:33:16,442
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

1302
01:33:16,579 --> 01:33:20,907
I had no idea they were coming,
or what got into Dick.

1303
01:33:21,041 --> 01:33:26,117
My dear, you mustn't assume guilt
for something that was unavoidable.

1304
01:33:27,171 --> 01:33:28,879
They've gone.

1305
01:33:30,091 --> 01:33:34,088
You are here.
That's all that matters now.

1306
01:33:34,219 --> 01:33:37,090
Nice of you to say so,
but if it hadn't been me...

1307
01:33:37,222 --> 01:33:39,926
You have the most penetrating eyes.

1308
01:33:40,058 --> 01:33:42,727
I can still see them
when I close mine.

1309
01:33:42,852 --> 01:33:44,643
- Professor?
- Call me Emile.

1310
01:33:44,770 --> 01:33:47,937
Would there be any value
in my contacting philosophers

1311
01:33:48,065 --> 01:33:51,231
in cities like
Omaha and Detroit and...

1312
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:54,064
and acquainting them
with empathicalism?

1313
01:33:54,195 --> 01:33:57,564
Your mouth suggests to me
burgundy velvet.

1314
01:33:57,699 --> 01:34:02,609
Dr Post, who runs a shop I worked in,
has contacts in several universities.

1315
01:34:02,745 --> 01:34:04,536
Please.

1316
01:34:07,290 --> 01:34:09,117
Don't say another word.

1317
01:34:09,251 --> 01:34:12,335
- But I came here to talk.
- We'll talk.

1318
01:34:12,462 --> 01:34:15,830
- Later.
- Why don't I come back later?

1319
01:34:15,965 --> 01:34:17,423
But I need you now.

1320
01:34:18,217 --> 01:34:21,632
Professor Flostre, I came here
to talk with a philosopher.

1321
01:34:21,762 --> 01:34:24,335
You're talking like a man.

1322
01:34:24,472 --> 01:34:27,592
But I am a man. And you're a woman.

1323
01:34:27,767 --> 01:34:30,174
That's not what I came
to talk about!

1324
01:34:30,311 --> 01:34:31,770
My dear.

1325
01:34:34,773 --> 01:34:37,857
There is a magical moment
waiting for us.

1326
01:34:37,984 --> 01:34:41,934
- Don't come any closer.
- Why are you behaving like this?

1327
01:34:42,071 --> 01:34:46,780
- I thought you said you come from Greenwich Village?
- I'm moving uptown. Yonkers.

1328
01:34:46,909 --> 01:34:48,533
But before you move...

1329
01:35:02,465 --> 01:35:06,082
I cannot keep them waiting any longer.
I must make an announcement.

1330
01:35:06,218 --> 01:35:09,717
- What shall I say?
- Tell them it was all my fault.

1331
01:35:21,733 --> 01:35:23,476
Maggie, where's Dick?

1332
01:35:23,610 --> 01:35:27,274
You told him to go and he went.
He flies at 10:30pm.

1333
01:35:27,405 --> 01:35:28,567
Oh no, he mustn't!

1334
01:35:28,697 --> 01:35:30,904
I knew you would not let us down!

1335
01:35:31,033 --> 01:35:34,651
- You must do the collection!
- Later. I've got to get to Dick.

1336
01:35:34,786 --> 01:35:37,703
- Later? We are so late already.
- I want to help.

1337
01:35:37,831 --> 01:35:41,116
I know how you feel,
even if you think I don't.

1338
01:35:41,250 --> 01:35:45,912
- I can put myself in your place.
- Maggie, that's empathy!

1339
01:35:46,046 --> 01:35:49,497
That's what you've been talking
about! Why didn't you say?

1340
01:35:49,633 --> 01:35:52,918
Get to work. I'll take care
of Dick. Leave it to me!

1341
01:35:53,053 --> 01:35:55,970
Lettie, what is the name
of Dick Avery's hotel?

1342
01:35:56,097 --> 01:35:58,848
- Le Savoyard.
- Get me the number.

1343
01:35:58,974 --> 01:36:02,177
- Quick, how long before we can begin?
- We're ready.

1344
01:36:04,646 --> 01:36:06,306
Messieurs et mesdames.

1345
01:36:06,439 --> 01:36:09,974
We are proud to bring you
a new collection by Paul Duval,

1346
01:36:10,109 --> 01:36:12,149
inspired by the Quality Woman,

1347
01:36:12,278 --> 01:36:16,738
chosen to represent a great American
fashion magazine, Quality.

1348
01:36:16,865 --> 01:36:19,072
We begin with hors d'oeuvre.

1349
01:36:32,588 --> 01:36:35,873
Hotel Savoyard?
M. Dick Avery, s'il vous plaît?

1350
01:36:41,054 --> 01:36:42,631
(bell rings)

1351
01:36:42,764 --> 01:36:47,674
- Monsieur, your bill is ready.
- I know. 352,428 francs.

1352
01:36:47,810 --> 01:36:50,810
- Merci, monsieur. Come back soon.
- Thank you.

1353
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:55,847
(woman) He doesn't answer, madame.
I will give you the desk.

1354
01:36:55,984 --> 01:36:57,608
(phone rings)

1355
01:36:57,735 --> 01:37:01,779
Hello. Monsieur Avery?
He just left.

1356
01:37:01,906 --> 01:37:04,443
Well, run out and get him!
It's urgent!

1357
01:37:05,242 --> 01:37:06,440
Oui, madame.

1358
01:37:09,621 --> 01:37:11,946
I'm so sorry. It was too late.

1359
01:37:21,883 --> 01:37:23,507
(applause)

1360
01:37:26,762 --> 01:37:30,759
- Did you get him?
- No. We'll get him at the airport.

1361
01:37:30,891 --> 01:37:33,464
- I can't find the number!
- How are you spelling it?

1362
01:37:33,602 --> 01:37:36,175
- A-U-L-Y.
- Orly. O-R-L-Y.

1363
01:37:36,312 --> 01:37:38,803
- You were there!
- I'm just so nervous.

1364
01:37:38,940 --> 01:37:40,932
- Are you ready?
- (Jo) Just about.

1365
01:37:41,067 --> 01:37:43,736
(announcer)
Monsieurs et mesdames, Jonquille.

1366
01:37:43,861 --> 01:37:44,940
(Jo) I'm ready.

1367
01:37:51,534 --> 01:37:54,784
You can board your plane now,
monsieur. Pleasant flight.

1368
01:37:54,912 --> 01:37:55,943
Thanks.

1369
01:38:00,292 --> 01:38:02,331
(loudspeaker)
Attention! Attention!

1370
01:38:02,461 --> 01:38:06,244
Monsieur Avery?
Monsieur Richard Avery?

1371
01:38:06,381 --> 01:38:08,338
Maggie, is there any news?

1372
01:38:08,466 --> 01:38:12,594
They promised they'd get my message
to him before he got on the plane.

1373
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,759
(clock strikes)

1374
01:38:14,888 --> 01:38:16,133
It's too late.

1375
01:38:16,265 --> 01:38:20,344
The clock must be fast.
He just hasn't got the message yet.

1376
01:38:30,277 --> 01:38:33,860
I'm sure he got it.
He didn't want to talk to me.

1377
01:38:36,533 --> 01:38:39,070
I don't blame him.
I hurt him too much.

1378
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:50,542
And now, the finale
of the collection. Wedding Day.

1379
01:39:02,139 --> 01:39:04,013
What a beautiful bride!

1380
01:39:04,141 --> 01:39:06,180
Yes. Pity it isn't her wedding.

1381
01:39:24,201 --> 01:39:25,446
Professor!

1382
01:39:25,578 --> 01:39:27,404
Keep away from me, you!

1383
01:39:27,538 --> 01:39:30,953
If you lay one finger on me,
I will call your embassy.

1384
01:39:31,082 --> 01:39:34,700
I want to apologize.
She wasn't worth fighting about.

1385
01:39:34,836 --> 01:39:37,587
- Don't tell me I did that!
- You?

1386
01:39:37,713 --> 01:39:40,121
You didn't even give me a headache.

1387
01:39:40,257 --> 01:39:43,957
She did this to me, with a statue
that cost 200,000 francs.

1388
01:39:44,094 --> 01:39:47,545
- She did that?
- I have 18 stitches in my head.

1389
01:39:47,681 --> 01:39:50,254
- She gave you 18 stitches?
- And a gashed lip.

1390
01:39:50,391 --> 01:39:52,051
And six stitches in my ear.

1391
01:39:52,185 --> 01:39:55,304
Professor, I love every broken bone
in your body!

1392
01:40:00,776 --> 01:40:03,527
Excuse me, Duval. Where is Jo?

1393
01:40:03,653 --> 01:40:06,322
She was magnificent!
You should've seen her!

1394
01:40:06,447 --> 01:40:09,365
- Where is she?
- I don't know, she was here...

1395
01:40:09,492 --> 01:40:11,568
Lettie! Have you seen Jo?

1396
01:40:11,702 --> 01:40:14,619
No, I...
Oh, Dick, she was just great!

1397
01:40:14,746 --> 01:40:17,154
Maggie, where's Jo?
Have you seen her?

1398
01:40:17,290 --> 01:40:19,366
She was here a while ago,
but she's disappeared.

1399
01:40:19,501 --> 01:40:22,335
- Did she say where she was going?
- I understand now.

1400
01:40:22,462 --> 01:40:25,628
She put herself in your place,
so put yourself in her place.

1401
01:40:25,756 --> 01:40:28,164
You'll meet each other
in somebody's place.

1402
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:31,217
That's it!
Maggie, you ought to be president.

1403
01:40:31,345 --> 01:40:32,755
I thought I was!

1404
01:40:59,078 --> 01:41:04,866
♫ I love your funny face

1405
01:41:06,334 --> 01:41:10,628
