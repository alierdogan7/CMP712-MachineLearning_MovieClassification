1
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:05,007
1999.
Kargil.

2
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:08,383
An unheard name that
suddenly came to the limelight...

3
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:11,052
A name where the
fights in the mountains...

4
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,024
...turned green camouflage red.

5
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:22,057
To win back these
mountains from the enemy...

6
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:24,069
...near the national
highway number one...

7
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,468
...the Indian army is
making arduous efforts.

8
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,070
After a difficult
battle of two months...

9
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,473
...only six mountains are left.

10
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:39,076
Let's meet some of these
soldiers who are trying...

11
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,619
...to win back these mountains.

12
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,623
Akash Sarin. IBN 7.

13
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:49,754
Balkar Singh, aren't
you afraid of bullets?

14
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:52,555
I am.

15
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,169
But not for me, for
the sake of our people.

16
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:05,099
Because when the
bullet hits the target...

17
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:10,172
...it pierces our hearts and passes
through the hearts of our dear ones.

18
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,078
What do you think about the war?

19
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:18,083
The real war used to take
place between Kings and Emperors.

20
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,088
Some of the soldiers
came forward and fought.

21
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:27,664
Balkar Singh tell me,
when will this war end?

22
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,128
The day when our
leaders and ministers...

23
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,141
...who give us orders to fight...

24
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:41,806
...when thy go along
with us and fight.

25
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:43,740
The day the war will get over.

26
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,119
Do you get a chance to
talk to your family?

27
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,122
Each one to his own destiny.

28
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,121
Do you write letters?

29
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:00,555
Yes, I write letters.
We do write letters.

30
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,556
What do you write?

31
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,133
Are you a reporter or a spy?

32
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:12,141
Here, you keep it.

33
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:18,842
But if something
happens to me, don't post it.

34
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:20,174
Why?

35
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,545
Because this letter has
my dreams written in it.

36
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,748
Which I will never
be able to fulfill.

37
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,392
Writing a letter is
tradition which we follow.

38
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,402
Actually even I
have written a letter.

39
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,195
You can keep it.

40
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,436
It'll be of use in your research.

41
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,536
I don't need it.

42
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:48,213
Because if something happens to me...

43
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,612
...the Army will call my brother.

44
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:51,543
And he will fly me back.

45
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:52,876
Brother?

46
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,289
Squadron leader, Vikram Shergill.
- Yes, Air Force.

47
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,415
And yes...

48
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:01,221
If you see him,
tell him I will be back

49
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,694
...to kick his ass.

50
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:10,198
Sir! Excuse me, Sir!

51
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:11,796
Sir...

52
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:19,207
Sir, are you going back?
- Yes.

53
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,375
Can you post this for me in Kargil?
- Yes. Sure.

54
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,219
Who is it for?
- Leave application, sir.

55
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,381
I'll post it.
- Thank you, sir.

56
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,444
You're welcome.

57
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,328
But before I could post the letter.

58
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,924
I got the news that Sahil
Naqvi sacrificed his life.

59
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,259
Along with the
remaining three mountains...

60
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,737
...three people were
left just for namesake...

61
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:52,777
Balkar Singh, Dhananjay Shergill,
Sahil Naqvi.

62
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:54,504
And many more like them.

63
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,657
This is not a story
of three soldiers.

64
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,257
This story is about our country.

65
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:15,695
"Loneliness."

66
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,759
Will you put me to sleep?
Change the channel!

67
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:25,340
"Uncle moon has slept and
uncle sun has waked up."

68
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,538
Hey! Turn right from ahead.

69
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,905
"Hold the needles of the watch,
they are running."

70
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:34,442
"One story has ended and the...

71
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:37,288
...other has begun, uncle."

72
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:43,986
"Uncle, the sun has risen."

73
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:50,525
Hey! Stop! Take this,
enjoy yourself.

74
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:02,336
This is fine.

75
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:06,777
Hi, baby!

76
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,409
It's for you.

77
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:09,677
Thank you.

78
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,626
Nice pants.
- Oh! Just bought them today.

79
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,595
Come in. C'mon in.

80
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
I hope your parents
aren't there inside?

81
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:26,696
This leather pant is boiling.

82
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:29,841
Come, close baby!

83
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:31,902
Uh... Can I use your toilet please?

84
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:36,348
Stop!
- Why? - Safety baby!

85
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,046
I thought you would have it!

86
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:40,347
What! Why would I have it! Fool!

87
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,712
Ok! Two minutes!
- What?!

88
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,593
What a relief!
- Come fast, sweetheart!

89
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:50,651
Coming baby!

90
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,064
Give me the keys of the bike.
I'll be back in a jiffy!

91
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:03,404
Sam, it's risky.
What if my Dad sees you?

92
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:06,073
I've been waiting for a month.
Don't make me wait any more.

93
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,936
Either way I have never seen your
father and neither has he seen me.

94
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,073
And even if he sees me...

95
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,741
...just tell him that a
friend had borrowed his bike.

96
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,679
Sammy! These are Dad's shorts!

97
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:14,742
They are clean, right?

98
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:16,410
Give me the keys.

99
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,653
Baby! I'll be back!

100
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,971
What's up, Nawab Saab (sir)?
Where are you?

101
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,034
Saand, I am in deep trouble.

102
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,099
Tell me, what happened?

103
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,106
Saand, I was wearing
those leather pants...

104
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:43,108
Nawab Saab, you have worn
it but do not remove it.

105
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,110
Once you remove it, you
won't be able to wear it again.

106
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:46,748
It shirks with sweat and heat

107
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,711
Saand, I've made that mistake.

108
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:50,915
Oh Nawab Saab, you are screwed!

109
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,981
I had told you not to wear leather
pants in the summers of Delhi.

110
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,117
Nawab Saab, what have you done?

111
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,518
Now give me a solution.

112
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,925
Ok, Nawab Saab, is
there any cream around?

113
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:02,832
Cream? Yes. Some hair remove.

114
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:07,566
Don't think... apply it immediately!
Cream is a lubricant.

115
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,868
Oh... Oh my God! where is it?

116
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:13,610
Nawab Saab, your Shivani... safety.

117
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:17,015
Baby, I've a surprise for you.

118
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,414
Oh shit!

119
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,482
Saand, it has formed some strange...

120
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,456
...paste and even my
hair is falling off.

121
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:28,651
Nawab Saab, you have
applied hair removal cream...

122
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:29,786
...and on top of it
added powder to that!

123
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,153
You were the one who
told me to do that.

124
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:32,725
Hey, Nawab Saab, not fair.

125
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,028
you can't blame me
for everything, ok?

126
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,125
Go, I'm not talking to you. Go!

127
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,461
Oh, Saand, oh, Saand,
listen, listen, listen...

128
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,967
You idiot! You too will suffer!

129
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:45,972
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

130
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,013
Hey uncle, you found my bike
to jump across to kill yourself?

131
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:54,716
Oh! Your bike! Anyway, son,
I'm going up to staff quarters.

132
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:55,845
Can I hitch a ride?

133
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,513
Come on sit!
- Thank you.

134
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,487
Come on sit!
- Yes.

135
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:06,064
Son, take a right from ahead...
which way are you going?

136
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,121
I am also going that way.

137
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,200
Go slow, son. Looks
like you are in a hurry!

138
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:15,206
Uncle, one doesn't get such a
chance often. - What chance?

139
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,970
The girl is alone at home.
I am going to give her company.

140
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,675
You never did
ding-dong during your heydays?

141
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:25,809
Ding-dong? And son, what
about the girl's father?

142
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,079
He's not there.
- What?

143
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,544
That fool has left early in the
morning to give tuition to someone...

144
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,886
...leaving his
daughter alone at home.

145
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:38,229
Son, just stop
after these two houses.

146
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,821
Enough, enough, enough, enough.

147
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:42,898
Uncle!
- I've reached!

148
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:43,957
Do you live some where around here?

149
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:48,106
Forget about me. Tell me
about you, you want to go here?

150
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,903
Oh yes uncle! How do you know?

151
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:53,771
Son, that is because the bike
that you are riding is mine.

152
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:59,544
And the shorts that you are
wearing also belong to me.

153
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,587
And the wonderful
thing is that the house...

154
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,055
...where you want to go is also mine.

155
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,651
Father has come back after
giving his tuition, son.

156
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,593
What took you so long, Sam?

157
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:11,652
Baby.

158
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,263
Saand, idiot! You are
going to get thrashed!

159
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,271
You've seen my condition!
What have you made me do?

160
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,799
Nawab Saab, it's all because of you!

161
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,604
Because of me! And do
you know, there is a...

162
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,076
...party at Shivani's house today?

163
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,203
I've lost that opportunity too!

164
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,541
Party! What are you saying?

165
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,306
Party! Nawab Saab, I've an idea!

166
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,613
How can we go? Only
girls and strippers allowed.

167
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:36,154
Hey girls, the strippers are here!

168
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,587
Wow.

169
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,116
It's interesting! Wow.

170
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:56,675
"Now we're gonna teach you
never gonna let you go."

171
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,973
"Now we're gonna teach you
never gonna let you go."

172
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:14,315
"Heart obtained such a gem..."

173
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:16,987
"Hey, girls. Let's have some fun."

174
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:20,657
"Heart obtained such a gem...

175
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,327
...I feel I'm flying high."

176
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:25,233
"These..."

177
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:33,008
"These mischievous guys."

178
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,341
"These mischievous guys."

179
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:44,786
"Heart obtained such a gem
I feel I'm flying high."

180
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:51,092
"Heart obtained such a gem
I feel I'm flying high."

181
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,354
"These mischievous guys!"

182
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,894
"These mischievous guys!"

183
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:08,045
"In your hearts, in your lips...

184
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:12,045
...in your hair, we want
to touch you everywhere."

185
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,048
"Hey, handsome guy!"

186
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,252
"Hey, handsome guy!"

187
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,786
"Hey, handsome guy!"

188
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:25,719
"Don't lock your eyes,
it may kill you."

189
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:29,199
"You might land you into trouble."

190
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:32,726
"Tell me how do you find this slap?"

191
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:36,263
"...I feel I'm flying high."

192
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,276
"These mischievous guys!"

193
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:03,362
"Fall in love..."

194
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:06,768
"Make me..."

195
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,304
"Fall in love with me."

196
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:16,906
"Make me yours."

197
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,977
"Take away the knife..."

198
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,450
"Take away the knife..."

199
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,448
"Take away the knife..."

200
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:29,386
"Let's welcome this golden moment."

201
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:30,450
"Let's welcome..."

202
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,395
"Let's welcome this golden moment."

203
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:38,334
"I feel I'm flying high."

204
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:41,795
"Guys!"

205
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,467
"These mischievous guys!"

206
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:50,143
"These mischievous guys!"

207
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:55,150
"Heart obtained such a gem...

208
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,155
...I feel I'm flying high."

209
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,384
"These mischievous guys!"

210
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,017
"These mischievous guys!"

211
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:05,427
"These mischievous guys!"

212
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:08,933
"Come into my life, o beloved."

213
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,902
"You're not less
than a roadside Romeo."

214
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:15,431
"Your beauty is really amazing."

215
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:19,034
"Just get lost,
don't try to flatter me."

216
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,510
"You've created uproar in my heart."

217
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,376
"Mind it, I'm the lioness."

218
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,245
"My heart says I love you."

219
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,444
"You're a museum piece."

220
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,046
"Give me one chance
to show my talent."

221
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,315
"This victory will be a fun."

222
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:37,055
"How will you survive today?"

223
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,528
"How will you survive today?"

224
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,833
How will you survive?

225
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,459
"These mischievous guys."

226
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:45,525
Stop it!

227
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,195
I know him.

228
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,270
He is not a stripper.
- Who cares!

229
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,012
I think he should leave.

230
00:16:56,582 --> 00:17:00,211
Hey, Nawab Saab, where are you
going? Say sorry to the CHICK.

231
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,819
I am mean sorry! To the ladies!

232
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,017
Sorry.

233
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:12,896
Institute of film making announces...

234
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:15,263
...the graduation
of the present batch

235
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:18,869
It is said that a new
generation brings in a new vision.

236
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:22,031
You'll form the new age of Cinema.

237
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:27,902
But some students who have
scored less marks will...

238
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,917
...have to submit a graduate
film to get their degrees.

239
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:39,583
For others, I congratulate
you as you stand graduates.

240
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:42,916
I've passed!

241
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:45,987
I've passed!

242
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,060
Nawab Saab.

243
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,193
Congratulations!

244
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:56,338
Mr. Sameer Suri and Mr. Ali Shah.

245
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,903
I'd like to see you in my office.

246
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,008
Sir, have we come first?

247
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,071
Yes, but from the back.

248
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:07,983
Do you know in this whole batch.
Only your grades are least?

249
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,481
Only us?
- Yes.

250
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,487
You've not attended
a single lecture.

251
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,617
And have failed the
practical as well.

252
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,627
No sir we have
attended two practical.

253
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:17,957
The ones in which we cheated

254
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,089
And we come to college everyday.
- Really?

255
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:21,624
Meet him.

256
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,430
Who is he?

257
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,067
Uncle!

258
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,546
He's Piya's dad.
Hello, uncle. How are you?

259
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,945
Not uncle, son. Your professor.

260
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,041
When did this happen?

261
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,107
Since the last term.

262
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,217
Piya told me he tutors.

263
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,984
Sir, you can imagine the
caliber of these two...

264
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,516
...who don't even know
who their professor is.

265
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,563
Correct, uncle.
- Yes, correct.

266
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,226
You'll have to
submit a graduation film.

267
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,329
Or else I will not give
you a graduation certificate.

268
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:01,596
Without which you can not
apply for your American visa.

269
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,338
But, sir
- Enough.

270
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,636
If you want to go to America,
get me the film.

271
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,314
Why are you two so happy?

272
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,019
You have not even graduated.

273
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,421
But we can not tell our family that.

274
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:24,093
Think about it, the only heir to
the Royal family of Indore fails!

275
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:26,697
And your dad would
congratulate you right?

276
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,999
Why do you always get
into problems together?

277
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,193
Because since
childhood we had pledged...

278
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,328
...to live and die together.

279
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,379
Ali, have you thought of
the topic for the film,?

280
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:47,381
Don't think too much, Nawab Saab.

281
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,147
We're making a porn movie.
- What?

282
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,654
'A night in the forest.'

283
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,451
And do you know who
will be our forest queen?

284
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,054
Piya.
- Shut up!

285
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,466
We thought under the
pretext of post-graduation

286
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,470
We will enjoy a vacation
for 2 years in America.

287
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,704
But now we will have
to make a film. Or else.

288
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:11,709
Or else, vacation cancelled.

289
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:15,713
We joined the course thinking
that everything would be easy

290
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,214
But Nawab Saab, this
has become a pain.

291
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:21,483
Saand, what do you think
should be the topic of our film?

292
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:25,218
Religion, politics, socio-economics.

293
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,224
Easy, Nawab Saab. Easy.

294
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:28,759
We can not even spell
most of these words.

295
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:30,658
What was that? Socio. Shoo-shoo.

296
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,699
Why don't you make a film on
joining the Indian Defense Forces?

297
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:37,291
Indian Defense?

298
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,564
This is all what a cadet of
the military academy can suggest.

299
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:40,627
Shut up!

300
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:43,072
And why are you doing it?

301
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,239
Who joins the
defense force these days?

302
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,436
I will.

303
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:47,500
You'll die if you join.

304
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,178
Looks like You are
looking for a one-day job?

305
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,510
You get shot straight in the head.

306
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:54,643
It's of no use.

307
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,111
In news channels, they
show it in the subtitles...

308
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,714
...one soldier dead in cross firing.'

309
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:02,285
Absolutely, You don't
even get paid well enough.

310
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:03,787
I just want that.

311
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,124
Amit is absolutely right.

312
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,188
You're risking your life,
And, what if you die?

313
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,361
Right. And on top of
that a grieving family!

314
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:14,103
Nawab Saab, I've found a topic.

315
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:15,528
The topic of our film.

316
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:19,777
'Why one shouldn't
join the defense forces? '

317
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:24,273
Amazing, Saand.

318
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,809
'Why not to join
the defense forces.'

319
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,174
Good one.

320
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:31,117
Why do you guys
always think negatively?

321
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:35,718
Riya, whatever you've heard in
the last one minute is right.

322
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:38,162
We gave you 3 reasons but Karan...

323
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,822
...couldn't... even give one.

324
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:41,496
Maybe, I just don't have a reason.

325
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:46,136
But I have an emotion
that I cannot explain.

326
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,237
Oh! Quiet! You find your emotion.

327
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,139
Meanwhile Nawab Saab
and I will make our film.

328
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:56,776
You know, you two
could meet my cousin.

329
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,179
He's a war journalist.

330
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,376
Maybe he could be of some help.

331
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:02,147
Viola, there, our
film is made, Nawab Saab.

332
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,779
Good morning sir.
- Good morning.

333
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,518
How is the chick at the reception,
Nawab Saab? - Stop it Sam!

334
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:10,720
Are you Sameer?
- Yes, sir.

335
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:14,156
Hi. Akash Sarin. Piya's cousin.

336
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,126
Ali.
- Sit down, sit down.

337
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,768
So tell me. What can I do for you?

338
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,202
Akash, just like you...

339
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,866
...we two graduated from the
institution... Err, I mean...

340
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,675
I mean...
- We've completed it, sir.

341
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,540
We've completed it, sir.
Yes, Riya has told me about it.

342
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:32,213
For the graduation
project we've decided to make...

343
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:36,516
...a film on 'Why not to join
the Indian defense forces? '

344
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:38,889
'Why not to join the
Indian defense forces? ' Yes.

345
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:40,718
I see. Interesting.

346
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:44,284
And Sir, we want you to share
your war experiences with us.

347
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:45,894
In a small interview sir.

348
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:48,455
Our film will be made, sir
- here write

349
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:55,462
Well, you know I've a
better idea than this interview.

350
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:59,433
Do you boys like adventure?

351
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:03,303
Any time, Sir!

352
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,314
Good. Come with me.

353
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,383
Excuse me.

354
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:19,260
Here, take these 3
letters to their addresses...

355
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,923
...and record your experience.

356
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:22,597
You'll get your film.

357
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,668
Sir, what's special
about these letters?

358
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:33,808
These are the last letters.

359
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,269
Last letters?

360
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:40,611
There is a tradition in
the Indian defense forces...

361
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:45,286
Every solider writes a
letter before leaving for war...

362
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:46,688
...which he keeps in his pocket.

363
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,289
If that soldier is
martyred the defense...

364
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,763
...force posts that
letter to his family.

365
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,866
That letter contains a few
last emotions of that soldier...

366
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:06,236
You two want to know why one
shouldn't join the army, right?

367
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:09,378
Meet these families...
You'll know it.

368
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:12,714
But sir, how did you
get these letters?

369
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,319
It's my 3 years old
research material.

370
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:16,649
Now it would be useful for you.

371
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:18,853
All the best.
- Thank you.

372
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,391
Good luck.
- Thank you. Bye.

373
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:01,292
Listen you guys.

374
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,333
You both are doing something
by your self for the first time.

375
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:05,835
Sometimes a little step
towards something takes...

376
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:08,031
...you to a lifelong path.

377
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:10,365
I hope this is it for you guys.

378
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:11,431
Let's go.

379
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:14,373
Day one. Track of turn.

380
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,744
We are out to look for
an answer to our question.

381
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:21,385
Whether one should
join Indian Army or not.

382
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:11,028
"Olla Signor.
- What's up, my bro?"

383
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:19,439
"Two friends have
left on a journey."

384
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:24,515
"The distance and
paths are nothing...

385
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:28,781
...when we are together."

386
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:37,124
"Olla Signor.
- What's up, my bro?"

387
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:45,531
"Two friends have
left on a journey."

388
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:50,130
"The distance and
paths are nothing...

389
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:54,138
...when we are together."

390
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:55,673
"We'll have fun on the go."

391
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:29,905
"The muddy roads...

392
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,778
...are welcoming us with open arms."

393
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,842
"And making some gestures."

394
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,911
"You didn't understand...

395
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,923
...small thing.
- What, pal?"

396
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:43,859
"The road says, keep moving on."

397
00:27:56,041 --> 00:28:00,000
"We'll reach for the
sky as we're special."

398
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:04,515
"We've the license
to rock and roll."

399
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:12,551
"Listen." Hey...
signore! What's up, my bro?"

400
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:21,222
"Two friends have
left on a journey."

401
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:25,898
"The distance and
paths are nothing...

402
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:31,632
...when we are together.
We'll have fun on the go."

403
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:08,601
Hey!

404
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:11,648
Does anyone know
Kuljeet Kaur's house?

405
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,811
I know where you can
find Kuljeet Kaur.

406
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:17,747
Yourself?

407
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:19,289
Saand praji (elder
brother) -Nawab saab.

408
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,818
Easy, easy. Watch the potholes.

409
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,295
Gyani ji (learned grand father)
says our country will go very far.

410
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:29,299
But with such roads a
person remains there only.

411
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,301
How can the country move
forwards on these kind of roads.

412
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:32,796
Stop, stop!

413
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:33,963
Stop, stop!

414
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:42,210
There. That's Kuljeet Kaur.

415
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:43,973
Hey... Kuljeet!

416
00:29:58,663 --> 00:29:59,721
Saand, camera.

417
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:16,006
Fool, you call your
mother by her name.

418
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:17,676
Have you any shame?

419
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:18,943
Mom... Shut up!

420
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:21,616
Where did you find
these sun glasses?

421
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,820
They are his, mom.
They were looking for you.

422
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:28,949
Greetings.
- Greetings.

423
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:30,683
Greetings.

424
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:33,658
We're students. We've come
here from Delhi to make a film.

425
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,257
We've brought this letter for you.

426
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:37,827
Can we record it?

427
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:39,759
Sure.

428
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:17,967
Thank you.

429
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:21,207
But the army could've posted it too.

430
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,414
Our acquaintances found some
letters in the records recently.

431
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:25,676
So we brought it.

432
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:27,708
We wanted to talk about
some other things as well.

433
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:30,284
Can we meet you later?
- Yes.

434
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:33,381
Where are you staying?

435
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:35,055
We'll find a hotel nearby.

436
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:39,861
On one hand you do
such a huge favor on me.

437
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,094
On the other hand you don't
even want to accept my gratitude.

438
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:49,832
Jassi tell them, guests in our
Punjab don't stay at hotels.

439
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:51,764
Come home.

440
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:54,743
Come. Come.

441
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,322
This is the fifth one. No more.

442
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:18,361
Gyani ji says, son, while
eating you shouldn't count.

443
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,270
Sons, here, have a
glass of buttermilk.

444
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,207
Everything will get digested.

445
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,346
Young man, you have some too.

446
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:34,347
Sons, when I was of your age.

447
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:37,752
I used to eat 10 such parathas
(Indian bread) just like that.

448
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:39,784
Isn't it, Lajo?

449
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:43,160
Oh forget it, you.
- Oh why should I forget it.

450
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,926
"Our Punjab oye."

451
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,800
"Our Punjab oye."

452
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:54,901
"On top of that corn
bread and mustard goulash."

453
00:32:55,506 --> 00:33:00,409
"When I sit in the field
I look like a royalty."

454
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:02,972
"Our Punjab oye."

455
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,781
"Our Punjab oye."

456
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:07,175
Grand Father.

457
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:11,978
Father.

458
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:14,847
Father.

459
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,962
You're so old still you
want to dance like that.

460
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:26,401
At least think of your age.

461
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:29,533
Lajo, I'm a martyr's father.

462
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,068
I won't be defeated
by age or disease.

463
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:36,546
Jassi, go to sleep, son.

464
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:37,876
So soon?

465
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:39,416
If I give you one,
you won't ask for more. Go.

466
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:42,853
Go to sleep, son.

467
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:52,961
If you don't mind, can
we take some pictures?

468
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,862
Yes. Why not?

469
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,904
Dear, I was
thinking that this year...

470
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:04,499
...if we make a shed for
the cows it will be good.

471
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:06,133
The poor child is trying.

472
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,911
Father, as soon as the
installment of the tractor is paid...

473
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,142
...l'll collect money for the shed.

474
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:15,885
Jassi will be going to
higher school next year.

475
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:20,288
I'm saving the
pension money for that.

476
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:22,948
No problem, dear.

477
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,320
You always do the right thing.

478
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:28,899
You're the son of this family.

479
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:39,906
This grand father will give me
a real bad stomach upset, pal.

480
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:41,903
Stomach is already upset, pal.

481
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:49,145
There will be a toilet here, right?
- Definitely not.

482
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:53,313
I'm certain we've to go to
the fields in the morning.

483
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:58,951
Cheers.
- Cheers.

484
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:07,933
You both are not asleep yet.

485
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:12,640
If you need anything...

486
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:14,001
No. We're fine.

487
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:20,946
I've a request if you don't mind.

488
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:25,519
Nobody at home is really educated.

489
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:31,522
And I don't want Jassi to read it.

490
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:38,465
If you could read
this letter for me...

491
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:40,495
Of course, Why not?

492
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:50,237
My dear Kuljeet...

493
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:52,004
I'm fine.

494
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:55,017
I hope you all are fine too.

495
00:35:57,388 --> 00:35:58,685
The weather is pleasant.

496
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:01,951
Everyone is awaiting the
glistening summer sunlight.

497
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:05,992
The nights are too cold here.

498
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:09,498
But we manage to go through
the nights with a born fire

499
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,363
The post is peaceful at the moment.

500
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:15,997
But even rare firing and
bombing keeps us alert.

501
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:21,041
Kuljeet, when I
return home this time...

502
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:23,580
...l'll take you and Jassi on a trip.

503
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:30,046
You know, a few
days back I was posted...

504
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:32,248
...on a hill top near a river.

505
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:36,618
There along with my comrades
I've learnt a way of fishing.

506
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:41,060
Catching fish with your bare hands
has a different charm all together.

507
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:48,264
Folding your pants and getting
knee-deep into icy cold water.

508
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,004
In a few moments
everything goes numb.

509
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:55,642
Then we put our hands
into the freezing waters.

510
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,080
You can't feel a thing
except the slithering of...

511
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,084
...a fish passing from
in between your hands...

512
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,086
...and with that
your hands start to...

513
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:05,281
...shake automatically,
instantly you grab the fish.

514
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:08,482
I'll surely want to teach
this technique to Jassi.

515
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:15,062
I want to see you all real soon.

516
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:18,260
I keep hearing Jassi's laughter.

517
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:22,503
Tell father we'll get him
operated as soon as I'm back.

518
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:24,468
That was already done last year.

519
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:42,090
Didn't he write anything else?

520
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:50,122
Yes.
- Kuljeet, I love you very much.

521
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,100
I miss you a lot.

522
00:37:57,475 --> 00:38:01,104
That's why I want to
reach you before this letter.

523
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,681
And I'll reach there for you.

524
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,117
You take care of everyone.

525
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:11,143
Take care of yourself too.

526
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:15,450
Your Balkar Singh. AC 159838.

527
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,719
Sand praji, get up.

528
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:51,154
Nawab Saab, get up... fast.

529
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:53,659
Get up. The Villagers
are here to meet you.

530
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,588
Get up fast.

531
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:00,627
Villagers?

532
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:03,164
It looks like the
whole village is here.

533
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,336
Get up!

534
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:17,445
He is still sleeping.

535
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,446
Yes, friend! Just go and check out...

536
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,617
They are not from the TV channel.

537
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,456
They are not from the TV channel.
Listen to us too.

538
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,190
Hear us, brother. Let us meet them.
- I can't let you meet them.

539
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:29,824
Uncle, please let us meet them.

540
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,367
Let us meet them.
The TV crew is there.

541
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:34,302
Listen to us. They
didn't let us meet you.

542
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:37,330
I said they're not TV crew.

543
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,376
Son, are you a TV crew?

544
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:42,310
I'm just a cameraman.
He's the director.

545
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,881
Oh the director! Director's here!

546
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:50,782
Oh... son, so you're the
TV crew. Come with me.

547
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:52,914
Sit here. Sit.
- Come on.

548
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:56,249
Sit. You too sit here
next to the director.

549
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:59,358
Sit. Sit.
- Focus the camera here.

550
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,556
Come on, click a snap.

551
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:02,929
Is it live? Live? Here.

552
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,594
Son, there is serious
water problem in our town.

553
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:09,268
Wife, turn on the TV quickly.
I'm on TV.

554
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:10,835
Everyone is watching, Everyone.

555
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:12,801
It's live.

556
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:17,479
Greetings. Is
everything fine in Canada?

557
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:21,375
Bansi, you've not sent my CD player.

558
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,250
Send a bottle of Black Label too.

559
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:28,253
And video games for Chhotu.

560
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:29,958
Brother, shoot me too.

561
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:35,465
Sir, tell your
government to ban his liquor.

562
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,490
Heard, father?

563
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:42,271
He drinks liquor during
happiness and in sorrow.

564
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:46,698
Now you say.

565
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:49,979
Aunt, we just came to
know about Balkar Singh.

566
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:01,889
Wife, I'll call later.

567
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,294
Ask me about Balkar Singh, sir.

568
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:10,428
He was a friend of friends.

569
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:12,662
He single-handedly taught
a lesson to the enemies.

570
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:14,704
Balkar Singh is the
pride of our town.

571
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:19,671
No one in this town is as
brave as our Balkar Singh, son.

572
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:39,361
Ok, sir. Greetings.

573
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:43,557
Bye.

574
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:48,328
Do come home.
We'll talk a lot about Balkar.

575
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:50,533
Come, brothers.

576
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:51,597
Greetings.

577
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,711
Greetings.
- Greetings.

578
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:07,615
Bye, child.

579
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,434
Son Jassi, the tractor is stuck.

580
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:19,964
I'll just get it out, mom.

581
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:23,805
Jassi, can we come too?

582
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:25,608
To get the tractor out?

583
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:29,473
Yes. This
bare-dude likes dare, dude.

584
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:30,802
Ok, come.

585
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:33,405
Hey Saand!

586
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,482
Bring it here!

587
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,027
Saand praji!
- Yes.

588
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:46,358
'S' is for Superman, right?
- Oh shut up.

589
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,892
'S' for Saand (bull)!

590
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:50,694
Apply some more strength,
try harder! See this

591
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:06,506
Very good Saand. 'S' for Supermen?
No 'S' for Saand.

592
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:16,652
Oh! Forget it!

593
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:43,418
Now push!

594
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,089
Come on Jassi!

595
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:49,688
Push!
- It is out! Come on, push!

596
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:53,889
Apply more strength!

597
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,431
Push harder!

598
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:05,508
Jassi, couldn't
you tell us earlier...

599
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:07,840
...We have to raise the
plough of the tractor?

600
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:09,570
I was testing.
- What?

601
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,979
How strong is the bull!

602
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:14,106
Naughty you!

603
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,549
Hey Jassi, you are an expert.

604
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:50,219
Very good Saand, Saand.

605
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:52,551
Saand, pull!
- I am pulling!

606
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:55,555
Let it loose! Let it loose!

607
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:56,752
Why don't you do it?
- No!

608
00:44:57,294 --> 00:44:58,556
Take it closer!

609
00:44:58,629 --> 00:44:59,891
Should I? Here you are!

610
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:01,157
Come on! Saand! C'mon!

611
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:02,493
Come on.

612
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:03,964
Cut it, cut it.

613
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:09,561
Take it closer!

614
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:12,631
Got you!

615
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,036
Rascal, you're cheating!

616
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,635
First you ask me to take it
closer and then you cut my kite!

617
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:16,771
I won't play with you!

618
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:17,905
You can't defeat me!

619
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:19,710
Wait! I'll get the kite back.

620
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:33,661
Nawab saab, stop! That's Pakistan!

621
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:46,606
Can a border look like this too?

622
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:05,161
Saand, check it out,
this is Pakistan buddy!

623
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:09,154
Saand, hurry, come fast!

624
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:18,841
What are you saying? It's
unbelievable! Looks the same!

625
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:26,046
Jassi look, our fields and
theirs are exactly the same!

626
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:27,844
It's not the same,
praji (elder brother).

627
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:32,655
You see this barb
wire separating them...

628
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:34,987
...Gyani ji (learned grand father)
says... this makes us very different.

629
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:42,723
Jassi, will you take
a photograph of ours?

630
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,789
Pass me the camera!

631
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:52,871
Jassi, let me take one of yours.

632
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:54,205
No, I'm fine.

633
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:00,614
Hey Jassi! Ever been across?

634
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:06,145
No. Papa had gone
and never came back.

635
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:11,758
But you shouldn't feel bad
because he was doing his job.

636
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:13,218
And they were doing theirs.

637
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,222
That's what Gyani ji says.

638
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:18,961
Come on, once more!

639
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:25,766
Hey Jassi! Wait!

640
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:46,057
Greetings, Mr. Gurjan Singh!

641
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:48,261
Greetings, aunt.
- Greetings!

642
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:51,661
Greetings, contractor.
- Is everything fine?

643
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:56,796
God is kind. How are you?
- I'm fine.

644
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:57,863
Greetings, contractor.

645
00:47:58,475 --> 00:47:59,737
Greetings, Kuljeet.

646
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:06,745
Two installments of the
tractor have not been paid.

647
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:09,275
I did whatever I could.

648
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:12,751
I have to answer to my superiors.
- Contractor sir... - Dad!

649
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:18,087
Contractor sir, you won't have
to answer to anyone. - Good.

650
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:20,218
I'll take your leave.

651
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:28,838
Dear, I think the cows can spend
another monsoon without a shed.

652
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:30,704
Don't worry about it.

653
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:32,297
Listen!

654
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:38,178
I have a silver anklet.

655
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:41,176
It is of no use to me at this age.

656
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:46,254
I think we should sell it...
- Mom!

657
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:59,199
Dad, don't you trust me?

658
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:01,793
My child!

659
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:07,804
I'll pay the
installment with the money...

660
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:10,403
...I had saved for Jassi's schooling.

661
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:14,817
Neither will the cows
get wet in monsoon nor...

662
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:16,876
...the silver bracelet be sold.

663
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:24,760
We'd rather better our today
than be hopeful for a tomorrow.

664
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:31,765
Daughter, we never missed
Balkar while you're with us.

665
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:34,025
God bless you.

666
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:39,101
God bless you with
all the happiness.

667
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:09,934
Saand praji, papa and mom had
met for the first time right here.

668
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:11,999
Papa used to come
everyday to look at her.

669
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:14,207
And one day he spoke to her.

670
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:40,367
Have a look, dad!

671
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:45,966
"I had asked for this wish."

672
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:58,054
"If I attain you,
it will be heaven."

673
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:08,921
"I had asked for this wish."

674
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:14,937
"If I attain you,
it will be heaven."

675
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:21,068
"If I attain you,
it will be heaven."

676
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:30,011
"I have fallen in love
for the first time."

677
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:35,423
"Come into my heart as my beloved."

678
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:40,486
"I had asked for this wish."

679
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:46,964
"If I attain you,
it will be heaven."

680
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,107
Through out the day
boys are looking at her.

681
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:53,500
With how many of them
will her brother fight?

682
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:57,035
The girl has young enough now.
Think of her wedding!

683
00:51:57,114 --> 00:52:00,447
I was thinking...
- I am young too! In two ways!

684
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:07,980
Hey.
- Greetings aunt! - Father.

685
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:11,994
Long live my son! Long live!
Where's Kuljeet?

686
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:16,123
I am sorry, son.
I didn't recognize you!

687
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:19,001
Everyone knew me in the village...

688
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:21,003
...now they since I went to taran
taran no one seems to recognize me.

689
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:26,408
Never mind! I've come to
marry your daughter, Kuljeet.

690
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:30,077
Who are you? You just
barge into the house.

691
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:32,606
Hey, hey! I am not unknown.
You know me.

692
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:34,411
I don't come to the Gurudwara
(Punjabi temple) to see you!

693
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:37,419
Our story is even
older than the Gurudwara!

694
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:41,082
Hey you!
- Just shut up! Sit down.

695
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:47,353
Look into your heart dear!
You'll find me only!

696
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:52,360
Dad, the boy has gone mad! Anyway...

697
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:54,962
I have already
selected my life partner.

698
00:52:56,373 --> 00:53:02,972
Hey you! Another boy!
Tell her, she'll marry me only!

699
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:07,573
Shut up and get lost!
Oh! Kuljeet dear. wait

700
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:19,055
I went to Taran Taaran and...

701
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:21,461
...the people back in
village have all forgotten me!

702
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:25,123
Balkar.

703
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,403
Kuljeet, do you recognize him?

704
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:42,282
See this.

705
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:50,616
Do you remember I wore the
uniform in Gurudwara. Let's talk.

706
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:52,483
Shall I take it as confirmed, uncle?

707
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:07,165
Tell me.

708
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:10,040
Am I not handsome?

709
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:21,314
"Our love is accepted by God."

710
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:27,187
"Hence God has sent
us to this world."

711
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:38,330
"Ask your father, how is the boy?"

712
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:44,273
"My father laughingly
said the boy is very good."

713
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:49,478
"My heart aches for you."

714
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:55,556
"If I attain you,
it will be heaven."

715
00:54:56,359 --> 00:55:01,763
"If I attain you,
it will be heaven."

716
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:10,434
"I have fallen in love
for the first time."

717
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:15,174
"Come into my heart as my beloved."

718
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:52,871
Listen! I'll sacrifice
many lives for you...

719
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:55,816
...but this life is for my country.

720
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:57,542
Do you accept?

721
00:55:58,621 --> 00:55:59,679
If you do then eat it.

722
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:03,748
Feed me too.

723
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:17,300
"If we get married soon."

724
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:22,641
"I want two boys next year."

725
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:34,321
"I am with you in your wishes."

726
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:40,252
"I will obey your orders."

727
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:45,529
"Now I am finally able
to attain my wishes."

728
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:51,532
"If I attain you,
it will be heaven."

729
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:57,473
"If I attain you,
it will be heaven."

730
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:06,217
"I have fallen in love
for the first time."

731
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:12,227
"Come into my heart as my beloved."

732
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:31,309
What happened? You've
started throwing tantrums...

733
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:33,906
...as soon as we are married!

734
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:44,515
Don't go!

735
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:47,396
I have to go.

736
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:57,868
What shall I name our child?

737
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:05,679
Jassi! If it's a girl, Jasmeet.
If it's a boy, Jaswindar.

738
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:09,751
We'll call them both Jassi lovingly.

739
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:15,353
At least now give me a smile.
C'mon, hurry!

740
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:30,695
May God take care of you!

741
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:39,978
'One day father went off like this;
and only his memories returned.'

742
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:41,448
Today is the second
day of our journey.

743
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:43,976
The answer to the question is true.

744
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:45,978
One should not join the
Indian army. That's the truth.

745
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,582
The truth is a soldier
gets killed in a war.

746
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:51,991
And leaves behind a wife to
face all the troubles, all alone

747
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:54,862
Everyone wants to
sacrifice something or the other.

748
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:56,521
But only for a while.

749
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:58,933
Because problems will never end.

750
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:00,525
Problems will recur.

751
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:02,665
Bigger and stronger!

752
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,401
Balkar Singh was not just a soldier.

753
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:09,411
He was also a son, a
husband and a father.

754
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:11,002
Cut!

755
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:21,355
It's true Nawab saab, who will want
to join the army for such a life?

756
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,492
Jassi!

757
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:36,564
What are you doing?

758
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:38,834
Saand praji, give me a hand.

759
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:52,977
Wait.

760
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:21,074
Saand praji, pick me up!

761
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:32,083
What are you doing?

762
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:35,758
Papa's uniform was incomplete.
I am completing it.

763
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:49,901
I'll also join the
army like my papa.

764
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:54,846
Then who will take
care of your mother?

765
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:57,981
Mom takes care of everyone and
will take care of herself too.

766
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:01,515
I'll take care of my country...

767
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:03,991
...this is what papa used
to say. And I believe that!

768
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:10,521
Jassi!

769
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:12,523
Go to sleep.

770
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:16,597
You rest too. You have to
set out early tomorrow morning.

771
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:52,167
The path you had taken, now your
son is walking on the same path.

772
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:57,705
He wants to join the army.

773
01:02:05,922 --> 01:02:07,583
I miss you a lot!

774
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:14,652
But it's ok.

775
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:21,603
I am just proud to be your widow.

776
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:34,806
I would sacrifice a
million lives for you.

777
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:55,637
Some snacks for the road.

778
01:02:56,706 --> 01:02:57,900
No thanks.

779
01:02:57,974 --> 01:03:00,636
Elders say, never refuse food.

780
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:03,906
Very good!

781
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:05,970
Thank you, all of you.

782
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:09,248
Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

783
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:10,580
Say goodbye to Jassi.

784
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:12,786
All right. Goodbye.

785
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:29,996
Saand praji, Nawab, stop!

786
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,874
Saand praji, Nawab, stop!

787
01:03:33,676 --> 01:03:34,734
Stop!

788
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,608
Saand! Nawab! Stop.
- Jassi?

789
