38
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:05,186
             LISTEN, THERE WAS A
             MAN IN THE BAR LAST
         NIGHT FROM THE CONGO.  

39
00:05:05,254 --> 00:05:07,021
         HE SAYS THERE'S        
         A FORTUNE IN IVORY.    

40
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:10,024
 THERE'S BEEN A FORTUNE         
IN EVERYTHING WE'VE TRIED,      

41
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:12,060
BUT IT WASN'T US                
 WHO FOUND IT.

HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE WE?         

45
00:05:19,268 --> 00:05:22,203
             LESS THAN A POUND  
             AND ALL OUR TRAPS  
            ARE IN THE PAWNSHOP.

46
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:23,988

                     IT DIDN'T  
                 COST A THING.  

50
00:05:33,432 --> 00:05:35,199
         I KNOW WHAT            
            IT COST.            

51
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:37,051
 THERE WERE TWO

        IT'S A 5-WEEK JOURNEY.  
         IT'S A LOT TO ASK.     

59

                 OF COURSE I'LL 
                 SPEAK TO THEM. 

317
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,626
                     BY THE WAY,
             I THOUGHT YOU WERE 
             STRONG AND SILENT. 

318
00:19:38,693 --> 00:19:43,614
 YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE           
 MR. QUARTERMAIN.               
 HE'S A TERRIBLE LIAR.

     GOD BLESS HER.             

320
00:19:49,337 --> 00:19:51,205
 WITH YOUR PERMISSION,          
     I'LL LIGHT UP.             

321
00:19:51,272 --> 00:19:54,474
             AND WITH YOURS     
         I'LL RUN OVER A FEW    
             OF MY PROPOSALS.   

322
00:19:54,542 --> 00:19:58,228
             I TAKE IT YOU WANT 
                 TO GET A SABLE 
            ANTELOPE, SIR HENRY.

323
00:19:58,295 --> 00:19:59,963
 IS MISS O'BRIEN OFTEN          
     AS LATE AS THIS?           

324
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,366
         SHE'LL SHOW UP         
     WHEN SHE'S HUNGRY.         

325
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:04,334
     SHE SEEMED TO ME           
     TO BE A CAPABLE            
        YOUNG PERSON.           

326
00:20:04,402 --> 00:20:07,904
     HMM--YES, CAPABLE          
        OF ANYTHING.            

327
00:20:07,972 --> 00:20:11,875
 SHE'D HAVE STOLEN ONE          
 OF MY WAGONS IF I HADN'T       
    KEPT ME EYES OPEN.          

328
00:20:11,942 --> 00:20:14,010
         [Quartermain]          
         ANYTHING WRONG?        

329
00:20:14,078 --> 00:20:16,546
        I TAKE IT IT'S IN ORDER 
         FOR SIR HENRY TO TELL  

330
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:19,533
             YOUR WAGON BOYS TO 
            OBEY THE YOUNG LADY.

331
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:22,369
        WITH THE RESULT THAT    
         YOUR WAGON IS NOW      
            PROCEEDING NORTH    

332

                    A CAMP.     

333
00:20:25,022 --> 00:20:26,623
BUT SHE TOLD ME--               

334
00:20:26,691 --> 00:20:29,192
             MY BOY, I'M AFRAID 
             YOU'RE THE VICTIM  
             OF A WOMAN'S WILES.

 IT'LL BE 2 DAYS BEFORE         
     I GATHER A TEAM.           

338
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:39,269

     WERE MUTINOUS.             

339
00:20:39,336 --> 00:20:43,740
