So, gentlemen, I urge you
to deliberate most carefully...

7
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,874
before reaching a decision
on so vital and momentous a question.

8
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,967
- Yes. Yes, of course.
- Mr. President.

9
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,707
I agree with our eminent professor
of metaphysics...

10
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,740
and I suggest that we postpone
further consideration of this-

11
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,412
- No, no! Definitely no!
- I object!

12
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,479
I must remind Professor Pillsbury...

13
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:05,717
that we cannot procrastinate further.

14
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,727
The press and public
await our verdict impatiently.

15
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,729
We must act today.

16
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,197
- Now!
- Right. Right, right, right.

Mr. President.
Mr. President.

18
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:18,837
After careful
and scientific analysis...

19
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:22,397
it is the opinion
of the department of mathematics...

20
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:26,935
that Yale University
can beat the pants off Michigan.

21
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:29,004
- [Chuckling]
- I disagree.

22
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,573
Look at what Michigan's team
did to Northwestern.

23
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,279
- Ah!
- You still owe me 50 cents from that game.

24
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,345
- I do not, sir! I paid you.
- [Chuckling]

25
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,754
- You never paid me that 50 cents.
- I distinctly remember-

26
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,759
Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen.

27
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:44,228
Remember that this great football classic
comes on Armistice Day...

28
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,959
just one week
before we play Harvard...

29
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:50,196
and we dare not risk facing
as strong a team as Michigan.

30
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,262
We must find a more
desirable opponent.

31
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,830
May I suggest Arkansas Normal?

32
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,571
I'm afraid not.
This game is for charity.

33
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:02,376
We cannot select too weak an opponent,
or no one will come to see it.

00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:05,474
- [All Chattering]
- Then how about Nebraska?

35
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:08,020
- Oh, no!
- Definitely not.

36
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:16,788
- Well, sir?
- We've decided on the University ofTexas.

37
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,797
- Texas?
- Yes.

38
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,959
Will you see that an invitation is sent
and that the newspapers are notified?

39
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,027
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,942

- Don't worry. He will.
- Remember, he's married.

58
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,804
And you know what
football coaches' wives are like.

59
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:46,250
I'll say. They think a forward pass
is something a girl shouldn't make at a boy.

60
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,810
Hey, Zeb.
Is the Fort Worth train on time?

61
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:52,380
Maybe. Tell you when she gets in.
Aimin' to go someplace?

62
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,552
No. We're meeting the new football coach.
He's coming all the way from New York.

63
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,619
Boy, we're gonna have
a team this year.

- We oughta make him cheerleader.
- Yeah.

00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,163
- Seen anything of Biff Bentley?
- No.

68
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,607
Fine thing if the captain
of the team isn't here.

69
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,544
We won't have much of a captain
if Sally Saxon doesn't let him alone.

70
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,946
Oh, here's Biff now!

71
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,451
Our captain's tackling
awfully high this season.

72
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:26,686
- The new coach'll fix that.
- Hiya, fellows. Sorry I'm late.

73
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,455
- Flat tire.
- I see you brought it with you.

74
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:33,192
- Hello.
- Hello, honey. Just talking about you.

00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:36,599

it was your engine knocking, darling.

- Hey, you two will have to cut that out.
- Jealous, Chippy dear?

77
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,306
Remember, Biff's in training.

78
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,070
Biff doesn't need any training.
He's perfect now.

79
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:46,771
You'll all have to toe the mark this season
with the new coach.

80
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,440
- Suits me. As long as he can teach us football.
- He will.

81
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,211
Boy, I sure had a tough time
luring him away from Flushing.

82
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:56,619
- Flushing what?
- Flushing, Long Island, and no wisecracks!

- Oh, excuse me, darling.

00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,045
Now, listen. Don't pull
any of those offside plays on me.

88
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,345
- I'm sorry, sweetheart.
- Sorry?

89
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:28,513
Not half as sorry as you're going to be for
dragging me out here to this forsaken desert!

90
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,886
Flushing was a heaven compared to this.

92
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:36,518

- Go on and finish dressing.
- Look, you can't talk to me like-

101

Wait a minute. Go back there
and coach those high school kids again?

165
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,823
Here I've got a chance to coach a college team
and get myself a reputation.

166
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:32,159
Yeah, a reputation that'll keep you
out of a job for the rest of your life.

Texas State University to play its football team...

not Texas State University,

I could withdraw the invitation...

to the University ofTexas.

That would be an obvious insult.

Just a minute, Dr. Burke.
May I say a few words?

204
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,535
Three teams have come
out of the south...

205
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:31,140
teams that the north never heard of
until they played Famous Northern 11 's.

206

when they played Harvard?

Well, publicity made those games interesting,
and publicity can do it again.

208

this Texas State University team.

00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:42,560
- You do?
- Of course.

210
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:46,086
They're light and fast and play
a brand of football we don't see up here.

211
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,099
They're tricky.
They're unorthodox.

212

- What for?

646

Out of the way, boys.

1140
01:28:54,512 --> 01:28:56,742
Herbie!
Come here!

1141
01:28:56,814 --> 01:29:00,682
- Yes, ma'am?
- Oh, Herbie, listen, and listen carefully.

1142
01:29:02,086 --> 01:29:04,418
I want you to go out there and-

1143
01:29:06,057 --> 01:29:09,493
- Here. You got it? Get going! Hurry!
- Yes'm.

1144
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:11,892
<i>[Horn Blares]</i>

1145
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:23,730
They've sent Van Dyck back in. I think
he's going to try a desperate, last-minute pass.

1146
01:29:23,808 --> 01:29:26,402
Wait a minute.
What's this?

1147
01:29:26,477 --> 01:29:29,412
Van Dyck sitting down in the mud.
Do my eyes deceive me?

1148
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:32,415
No, sir. He's taking off
his shoes and stockings.

1149
01:29:32,483 --> 01:29:34,917
It's a sight you may never see again.

1150
01:29:34,986 --> 01:29:38,422
The stories about him must be true-
he likes to feel his toes grip the earth.

1151
01:29:38,489 --> 01:29:41,822
He's getting ready to put
everything he has into one long pass.

1152
01:29:41,893 --> 01:29:45,488
The timekeeper has his gun ready to
end the game. Van Dyck's getting up now.

1153
01:30:05,950 --> 01:30:08,043
- Pass! Pass!
- I got him!

1154
01:30:21,432 --> 01:30:23,923
<i>[Cheering Continues]</i>

1155
01:30:26,270 --> 01:30:29,569
Van Dyck scores!
It's a touchdown! Touchdown!

1158
01:30:46,357 --> 01:30:49,292
Slug! Slug!
Wake up, Slug!

1159
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:52,295
- [Muttering]
- Oh, come on! Snap out of it!

1160
01:30:52,363 --> 01:30:54,297
[Muttering]
Let's get in there, Coach.

1161
01:30:54,365 --> 01:30:57,857
Aw, cut it out! It's all over!
Slug, we won!

1162
01:30:57,935 --> 01:30:59,869
Oh, I-What?

1163
01:30:59,937 --> 01:31:03,100
- Yeah! We won! We beat 'em, Slug!
- We won?

1164
01:31:03,174 --> 01:31:05,165
- Whoo-hoo-
- Yeah! Whoo!

1165
01:31:06,244 --> 01:31:08,235
Hey!

1166
01:31:09,714 --> 01:31:12,945
