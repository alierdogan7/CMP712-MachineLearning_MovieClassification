1
00:01:45,204 --> 00:01:47,508
We can't remain locked here.
You have to let us out.

2
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:49,589
You know very well we were supposed
to be jailed for just one night

3
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,126
and we've been
here three days already.

4
00:01:51,127 --> 00:01:53,911
Well, yeah. But what do you
want me to do?

5
00:01:53,912 --> 00:01:57,402
The mayor is the only one
who could release you.

6
00:01:57,435 --> 00:02:00,060
And now there's no way.
He's away visiting the oil fields.

7
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:03,601
So until he's back,
you'll have to stick around.

8
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:07,295
If he went to the oil fields,
he won't be back.

9
00:02:07,296 --> 00:02:08,456
Well, who knows.

10
00:02:11,683 --> 00:02:13,442
My brother-in-law
has been there a month now

11
00:02:13,443 --> 00:02:15,753
and he's making a lot of money.

12
00:02:15,973 --> 00:02:19,173
In his last letter
he says the oil companies

13
00:02:19,494 --> 00:02:21,634
pay $20 to $30 dollars a day.

14
00:02:22,312 --> 00:02:22,882
No way.

15
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:28,829
Did you hear that?
$20 to $30 dollars a day.

16
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,462
We should've been there three days ago,
making that money.

17
00:02:32,463 --> 00:02:35,151
I know that song by heart, already.
Stop saying it.

18
00:02:35,152 --> 00:02:37,296
I'm the one to blame.
But where have you ever seen

19
00:02:37,297 --> 00:02:39,056
that saying something nice
to a woman is a crime?

20
00:02:39,057 --> 00:02:42,034
Saying something nice is not a crime.
But punching her husband in the eye

21
00:02:42,035 --> 00:02:44,756
won't make the town
embrace you as a son.

22
00:02:44,757 --> 00:02:48,287
Go to bed now.
You won't rot in jail after all.

23
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:57,619
You have to hurry up.

24
00:02:57,692 --> 00:03:01,117
I should leave you here. That'll teach
you not to get us in trouble.

25
00:03:01,118 --> 00:03:02,928
You're always complaining.

26
00:03:28,718 --> 00:03:31,406
Now listen boys.
Soon we'll all be out of here.

27
00:03:31,407 --> 00:03:33,777
It's best not to want to escape.

28
00:03:34,032 --> 00:03:36,272
It's best not
to want anything.

29
00:03:36,273 --> 00:03:39,283
You just go with your friend. I hope
soon you'll get wherever you want to go.

30
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:42,452
But you have to come, too. Or they will
accuse you of aiding us to escape

31
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:44,085
and throw more jail time at you.

32
00:03:44,086 --> 00:03:46,967
Even better. Where else will people
feed you for doing nothing?

33
00:03:46,968 --> 00:03:49,118
Well, you may be right, Tubio.

34
00:03:49,176 --> 00:03:51,065
Okay, now everybody
mind their own business.

35
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:51,806
Let's go.

36
00:06:56,193 --> 00:06:57,953
Hey, you think we
will fit there?

37
00:06:57,954 --> 00:06:59,938
I will. Let's see if you can.

38
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:03,709
I'll wait for you at the oil fields.
See you later.

39
00:07:07,112 --> 00:07:07,982
THE NATIONAL

40
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:10,707
HELP WANTED

41
00:07:23,441 --> 00:07:26,449
- Mr. José Enrique.
- What's up, Heriberto?

42
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,811
Nothing, boss. I just came to see
if you had any job for me.

43
00:07:29,812 --> 00:07:32,084
- Nothing, as you can see.
- Jesus.

44
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,870
If I was you, I wouldn't let those
assholes do what they want, boss.

45
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,361
If you need me,
just let me know.

46
00:07:38,265 --> 00:07:39,495
Thanks, Heriberto.

47
00:07:40,635 --> 00:07:43,125
If I only had
a few resolved men,

48
00:07:43,676 --> 00:07:46,620
you bet the oil wells
of The National would be producing.

49
00:07:46,621 --> 00:07:47,611
Ay, Chihuahua.

50
00:07:48,894 --> 00:07:50,634
When it rains, it pours.

51
00:07:55,715 --> 00:08:00,175
Last time I got paid was on
my saint's day, wasn't it, boss?

52
00:08:00,261 --> 00:08:03,171
Jesus, how slowly
a whole month goes by.

53
00:08:04,904 --> 00:08:08,681
- Aren't we in dire straits?
- Worst than dire straits, boss.

54
00:08:08,682 --> 00:08:10,242
Here's a few dollars.

55
00:08:11,372 --> 00:08:13,872
- It may help you a bit.
- Thanks.

56
00:08:15,182 --> 00:08:18,670
I wish I could walk into Rayado now
with all his white guards,

57
00:08:18,671 --> 00:08:20,281
to see who's the man.

58
00:08:20,977 --> 00:08:23,867
I'll see you later.
Now I'm very busy.

59
00:08:32,855 --> 00:08:34,905
Little Rayado,
Little Rayado,

60
00:08:36,346 --> 00:08:37,906
he can no longer walk

61
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:41,489
Because his father,
because his father...

62
00:08:42,557 --> 00:08:45,950
I see you're happy, my friend.
What are you doing here?

63
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:47,111
Just passing by.

64
00:08:47,968 --> 00:08:51,937
Make sure you're not passing
with a couple of bullets. You hear me?

65
00:08:51,938 --> 00:08:56,068
Just let me go. I'm a man of peace.
I don't want no trouble.

66
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:58,436
You know that working here
is forbidden?

67
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:01,383
Working? I just came
to say hi to the boss.

68
00:09:01,384 --> 00:09:04,474
Okay. But nobody mocks
orders by El Rayado.

69
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,338
Understood?

70
00:09:07,562 --> 00:09:09,099
Is José Enrique there?

71
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,470
Yes... yes, Mr. Fabio.
But he's very busy now.

72
00:09:25,397 --> 00:09:27,617
Good morning,
Mr. José Enrique.

73
00:09:29,175 --> 00:09:30,395
Hello, Mr. Fabio.

74
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:33,977
I was in the neighborhood
and I thought I'd come and greet you.

75
00:09:33,978 --> 00:09:36,058
And to insist that I sell you
the oil wells, right?

76
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:39,388
Look, Mr. José Enrique.
I come here as a friend

77
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:41,309
in order to help you
get out of this tight spot.

78
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,350
The National will never work.

79
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,559
Stop deceiving yourself and sell those
three wells once and for all.

80
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,089
They're doubling the offer and
that's a lot of money, Mr. Enrique.

81
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,290
So you're advising me to sell.

82
00:09:51,428 --> 00:09:54,518
Naturally. You and I
are both practical men

83
00:09:54,853 --> 00:09:57,030
and we both know who's
the real boss.

84
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:58,182
Yes, they're tough.

85
00:09:58,183 --> 00:10:00,391
For a month now they've not allowed
anybody to get hired here.

86
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,344
It must be that no one
wants to work here.

87
00:10:02,345 --> 00:10:04,795
Workers make
too many demands now.

88
00:10:08,205 --> 00:10:10,065
Enough of this, Mr. Fabio.

89
00:10:10,222 --> 00:10:13,007
See those wells? I'm ready
to blow them up

90
00:10:13,008 --> 00:10:14,319
if I'm not allowed to work.

91
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,855
Aren't you overreacting a bit?

92
00:10:15,856 --> 00:10:17,777
No, sir.
I've made my decision.

93
00:10:17,778 --> 00:10:20,147
Nobody will make me
change my mind.

94
00:10:20,148 --> 00:10:23,638
Tell it to whoever sent you
here to threaten me.

95
00:10:30,137 --> 00:10:33,530
All right, Mr. José Enrique.
You know what you're doing.

96
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:36,081
I already did my part
as a friend.

97
00:10:42,881 --> 00:10:44,751
Goodbye,
Mr. José Enrique.

98
00:10:45,185 --> 00:10:46,925
I hope you find workers.

99
00:10:59,786 --> 00:11:01,296
The ball is spinning.

100
00:11:02,668 --> 00:11:03,938
All bets are off.

101
00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:06,119
Red 27.

102
00:11:11,408 --> 00:11:13,328
Ay, Chihuahua.
When you're having bad luck,

103
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:15,377
better to start selling beans.

104
00:11:15,378 --> 00:11:16,648
Don't lose heart.

105
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:19,669
I once won
after losing all night long.

106
00:11:21,205 --> 00:11:22,485
How did you do it, Nanette?

107
00:11:22,486 --> 00:11:24,176
After I lost everything,

108
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:26,391
- the casino burnt down.
- Jesus.

109
00:11:26,392 --> 00:11:29,072
Everybody ran away.
I took the money.

110
00:11:29,242 --> 00:11:32,852
It was a Friday the 13th.
I remember it perfectly.

111
00:11:33,116 --> 00:11:36,669
13? Then, I'll play the 26,
because it's two 13s.

112
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,930
Let's see if the casino
burns down meanwhile.

113
00:11:40,064 --> 00:11:41,056
All bets are off.

114
00:11:41,057 --> 00:11:43,207
Leave it, blondie.
I saw you.

115
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:47,875
Jesus, Nanette.
You never change.

116
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:50,405
You're the worst thief
in the oil fields.

117
00:11:50,406 --> 00:11:53,575
A thief, no. The doctor says
I have an illness

118
00:11:53,576 --> 00:11:54,986
called "kleptomania."

119
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:56,505
"Keptomania"?

120
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:57,782
"Kleptomania".

121
00:11:58,027 --> 00:12:01,157
Whatever.
I'm so broke and you're so sick.

122
00:12:02,061 --> 00:12:04,311
Okay, we'll leave it as it is.

123
00:12:04,397 --> 00:12:06,798
- Thank you, my friend.
- You're welcome.

124
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,366
I was just standing here, so...

125
00:12:08,367 --> 00:12:11,056
Let me buy you a drink.
Heriberto Malo.

126
00:12:11,057 --> 00:12:12,946
Gerardo Ramirez, nice to meet you.
He's my friend...

127
00:12:12,947 --> 00:12:15,570
- Demetrio Garcia.
- Nice to meet you. You're invited, too.

128
00:12:15,571 --> 00:12:18,293
- Thank you.
- Here, take these two chips to play.

129
00:12:18,294 --> 00:12:20,725
And find a cure for that ugly
"keptomania" of yours.

130
00:12:20,726 --> 00:12:23,511
I like to see you with
so much energy, Heriberto.

131
00:12:23,512 --> 00:12:25,022
I like energetic men.

132
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,330
The ball is spinning.

133
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:34,685
Have you been long
here at the oil fields?

134
00:12:34,686 --> 00:12:36,927
- Two days.
- Two days that seem like 20.

135
00:12:36,928 --> 00:12:37,268
Why?

136
00:12:38,113 --> 00:12:40,064
Because we spent
all four dollars we had

137
00:12:40,065 --> 00:12:43,385
- to pay for our first and only meal.
- Jesus.

138
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:51,981
The ball is spinning.

139
00:12:52,777 --> 00:12:53,587
Three rums.

140
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,834
To think that we believed
that bums became millionaires here.

141
00:12:57,835 --> 00:13:00,140
And we haven't found
even a miserable job.

142
00:13:00,141 --> 00:13:02,445
Do you know of any work
we can do around here, my friend?

143
00:13:02,446 --> 00:13:04,666
Anything.
We have no pretenses.

144
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:08,400
What a coincidence.
My boss is looking for workers.

145
00:13:08,401 --> 00:13:11,250
He's from Argentina
and a wonderful man.

146
00:13:11,251 --> 00:13:13,401
But his wells are not working.

147
00:13:14,645 --> 00:13:16,615
Now, the job has its risks.

148
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,750
But... it's legal, right?

149
00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:22,905
Legal and very legit. But they are
threatening whoever works there.

150
00:13:22,906 --> 00:13:26,042
Oh, yeah? So, what he needs
is to find more workers.

151
00:13:26,043 --> 00:13:28,475
Well, I'll take care of that
and let's see who says otherwise.

152
00:13:28,476 --> 00:13:31,934
Jesus. If that happens,
my boss will be so happy.

153
00:13:31,935 --> 00:13:34,895
- And what can you do?
- I'm a mechanic.

154
00:13:35,137 --> 00:13:36,467
A mechanic. A man.

155
00:13:37,026 --> 00:13:39,330
And another man,
if I may say so.

156
00:13:39,331 --> 00:13:42,019
Jesus, my friends.
You've made your fortune already.

157
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,190
- Bottoms up. Cheers.
- Cheers.

158
00:13:51,658 --> 00:13:54,251
Remember what you told me
this morning, Mr. José Enrique?

159
00:13:54,252 --> 00:13:56,222
Well, here's what you need.

160
00:13:56,396 --> 00:13:59,277
These folks are looking for a job.
They know what it's about

161
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:01,071
and they're ready to
do anything.

162
00:14:01,072 --> 00:14:03,632
With me, you already have
three men to start the work,

163
00:14:03,633 --> 00:14:05,833
even if it's little by little.

164
00:14:06,354 --> 00:14:07,274
Take a seat.

165
00:14:15,158 --> 00:14:18,456
Where were you before
arriving at the oil fields?

166
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:21,209
You say before arriving
at the oil fields?

167
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,226
Well, we went
to several places.

168
00:14:23,227 --> 00:14:25,607
Last place we stayed
was a jail.

169
00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:30,014
What? It's true.
Nothing we can do about it.

170
00:14:30,015 --> 00:14:33,055
Nothing significant.
You know how boys are.

171
00:14:33,217 --> 00:14:36,898
After all, I'm in no position to ask you
for recommendation letters

172
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:39,042
and I trust you.
I like your honesty.

173
00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:41,092
- Naturally.
- I have to warn you:

174
00:14:41,093 --> 00:14:43,654
whoever works at The National
is under threats.

175
00:14:43,655 --> 00:14:45,414
This is not like any other job.

176
00:14:45,415 --> 00:14:49,673
If you want, while I prepare the pumps,
Gerardo can go out to hire more people.

177
00:14:49,674 --> 00:14:53,259
If it's no more than that, I'm ready
to fight anybody.

178
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,685
- I've been in worse situations before.
- You risk your skin here.

179
00:14:56,686 --> 00:14:59,576
It will last me until it's
time to go.

180
00:15:00,048 --> 00:15:01,148
Then, go ahead.

181
00:15:01,682 --> 00:15:03,633
Now everybody
go mind their jobs.

182
00:15:03,634 --> 00:15:05,393
Let's play with all our hearts.

183
00:15:05,394 --> 00:15:08,532
Now you're talking. A man has to do
what a man has to do,

184
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:09,621
as they say in my country.

185
00:15:09,622 --> 00:15:11,362
You'll see, Mr. Enrique.

186
00:15:12,087 --> 00:15:13,975
Together we'll be unbeatable.

187
00:15:13,976 --> 00:15:14,846
The National

188
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:20,933
Don't ask for employment.
No more jobs available.

189
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:30,705
Next.

190
00:15:34,531 --> 00:15:34,991
Ready.

191
00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:41,959
For the success of your efforts,
Mr. José Enrique.

192
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,740
And for all the help
you've given me.

193
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,515
Well, I think they won't be able
to stop us now.

194
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:53,656
How furious they must be,
because we hit them really hard.

195
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:03,923
Remind me to telegraph my sister
tomorrow, to cancel her trip.

196
00:16:03,924 --> 00:16:04,674
Yes, boss.

197
00:16:04,948 --> 00:16:06,901
I didn't know you had
a little sister.

198
00:16:06,902 --> 00:16:08,292
Is she coming here?

199
00:16:08,438 --> 00:16:11,895
Yes. She tells me in this letter
she'll arrive in eight days.

200
00:16:11,896 --> 00:16:13,721
As soon as her contract ends
in Mexico.

201
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,992
Her contract?
What does she do?

202
00:16:16,955 --> 00:16:18,285
She's a performer.

203
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:20,764
If she comes,
you won't be so lonely.

204
00:16:20,765 --> 00:16:22,237
That's what I thought, too.

205
00:16:22,238 --> 00:16:26,111
But in this situation, it will be crazy
to bring her to live here with me.

206
00:16:26,112 --> 00:16:29,345
You've already seen
how many difficulties we've had

207
00:16:29,346 --> 00:16:31,256
and the risks we've taken.

208
00:16:31,267 --> 00:16:34,517
How long has it been since
you saw her last?

209
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:37,605
When I left Buenos Aires,
she was just a kid.

210
00:16:37,606 --> 00:16:39,718
I thought of bringing her
to live with me some day.

211
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:42,920
I established myself here
and put my mind on the job.

212
00:16:42,921 --> 00:16:44,937
Her letters to me
never stopped,

213
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:47,595
always written
with the same affection.

214
00:16:47,596 --> 00:16:48,986
Listen to this one.

215
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:56,080
"I'm so happy that I'm going to see
again that brother

216
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,801
who seemed to exist
only in my imagination.

217
00:16:58,802 --> 00:17:03,060
You can never forget the land
where you were born, Mr. José Enrique.

218
00:17:03,061 --> 00:17:04,571
No, you never forget.

219
00:17:05,718 --> 00:17:08,618
Sometimes I feel as if
I never left it.

220
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,833
As if I can still smell its air.

221
00:17:11,834 --> 00:17:13,394
It's a natural thing.

222
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:17,147
Leaving your land far behind
makes you love it even more.

223
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:20,189
Yours must be a great country,
isn't it, Mr. José Enrique?

224
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:24,440
From the distance, it seems to me
the greatest of them all.

225
00:17:27,042 --> 00:17:30,652
Well done, Heriberto.
I think you had a good idea.

226
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,760
Well done, Gerardo,
well done.

227
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,345
Thank you very much,
Mr. José Enrique.

228
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,776
I'll keep you in mind
next time.

229
00:20:49,844 --> 00:20:54,102
Well, if we want to pump oil tomorrow
at 8:00, we better go back to work.

230
00:20:54,103 --> 00:20:58,391
Yes. That's the most important thing:
that the wells start producing tomorrow.

231
00:20:58,392 --> 00:21:01,752
But don't forget tonight you're invited
to celebrate our success.

232
00:21:01,753 --> 00:21:03,866
I can't, Mr. José Enrique.
I have the night shift.

233
00:21:03,867 --> 00:21:06,651
- If you want, I can...
- You stay here to help me.

234
00:21:06,652 --> 00:21:09,566
Some other time, then.
Gerardo will come with me.

235
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:11,423
He has nothing to do here.

236
00:21:11,424 --> 00:21:14,240
We'll pay a visit to
Mr. Fabio's casino

237
00:21:14,241 --> 00:21:18,011
and see what kind of face
he makes when he sees me.

238
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:20,308
Lucky at gambling,
unlucky in love.

239
00:23:22,953 --> 00:23:24,297
Didn't I tell you?

240
00:23:24,298 --> 00:23:26,859
Mr. José Enrique is
very drunk already, boss.

241
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,720
Hey, my friend,
bring us more champagne.

242
00:23:31,054 --> 00:23:34,574
You'll have to forgive me, Mr. José
Enrique, but I can't drink any more.

243
00:23:34,575 --> 00:23:38,032
We have to be happy, Gerardo.
After so many bad days,

244
00:23:38,033 --> 00:23:40,562
you need something
to look forward to.

245
00:23:40,563 --> 00:23:43,703
Do as he says, Gerardo.
You only live once.

246
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:48,946
- José Enrique.
- Camelia.

247
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:51,063
I thought you wouldn't
remember me.

248
00:23:51,064 --> 00:23:52,634
I always remember you.

249
00:23:52,762 --> 00:23:55,642
I'm glad you could come.
Take a seat and have a drink.

250
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:59,420
My friend, Gerardo Ramirez.
Camelia, the nicest of all dancers.

251
00:23:59,421 --> 00:24:00,691
Nice to meet you.

252
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:05,407
- You used to visit me more often.
- You know you're my favorite one.

253
00:24:05,408 --> 00:24:09,187
A great success for you
and some room in your heart for me.

254
00:24:09,188 --> 00:24:12,228
Not just some room. If you knew
how much I like you.

255
00:24:12,229 --> 00:24:15,019
And how much I like you,
José Enrique.

256
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:19,335
The 11th commandment:
you should not intrude.

257
00:24:19,336 --> 00:24:20,936
I'll buy you a drink at the bar.

258
00:24:20,937 --> 00:24:23,037
Thank you, Gerardo.
How nice.

259
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,663
I notice something strange
about you tonight, Camelia.

260
00:24:31,664 --> 00:24:32,654
Strange, what?

261
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:36,529
I don't know. I saw it in your eyes
when you came to the table.

262
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:39,490
Well, I don't want you
to get emotional.

263
00:24:42,966 --> 00:24:46,679
The important thing is that we're
together and we'll be very happy.

264
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,140
Right?

265
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:16,720
- Get her out of here.
- Throw that old woman outside.

266
00:25:24,429 --> 00:25:27,299
- The Northern Song.
- The Northern Song.

267
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,770
Brutes.
They prefer the worst song

268
00:25:46,264 --> 00:25:47,954
to that beautiful waltz.

269
00:25:48,635 --> 00:25:51,195
Everybody likes only
what moves them inside.

270
00:25:51,196 --> 00:25:53,096
It's true. But I just get

271
00:25:55,198 --> 00:25:56,948
moved by romantic things,

272
00:25:57,247 --> 00:25:58,707
very romantic things.

273
00:25:59,681 --> 00:26:03,361
Yeah? Well, whenever
you feel romantic, let me know.

274
00:26:18,155 --> 00:26:20,135
Heriberto. What a cute name.

275
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:25,070
I like him because he reminds me
of a great love of mine.

276
00:26:25,071 --> 00:26:27,440
A cook in the foreign legion,
in Morocco.

277
00:26:27,441 --> 00:26:29,241
Have you been in Morocco?

278
00:26:29,841 --> 00:26:32,231
He looked so much
like Heriberto.

279
00:26:33,203 --> 00:26:37,373
It was his fault I got fat;
he made me eat at all times.

280
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:41,143
One day, we went out on a date
and he said to me,

281
00:26:41,144 --> 00:26:43,594
"Nanette, you're
the most virginal

282
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:45,130
of all women."

283
00:26:46,587 --> 00:26:48,847
I couldn't resist
and I cried.

284
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:54,585
When I met him, I was single
and didn't have any money.

285
00:26:54,591 --> 00:26:57,503
He said, "Nanette, you're
the most beautiful

286
00:26:57,504 --> 00:26:58,544
of all women".

287
00:26:59,714 --> 00:27:02,494
What could I do?
I ran away with him.

288
00:27:02,532 --> 00:27:04,922
He looked so much
like Heriberto.

289
00:27:05,797 --> 00:27:08,710
On a July 14, I went to Argel
with a captain.

290
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:10,824
And the cook found me
on the train.

291
00:27:10,825 --> 00:27:13,770
I didn't want to do it,
but the captain convinced me

292
00:27:13,771 --> 00:27:17,515
saying we had to celebrate
the storming of the Bastille.

293
00:27:17,516 --> 00:27:20,016
But the cook was not
into parties.

294
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:26,224
He looked so angry, that I felt
like covering him with kisses.

295
00:27:26,225 --> 00:27:30,365
He said, "Nanette, you're the
most wretched of all women".

296
00:27:30,772 --> 00:27:35,762
Well, he didn't exactly put it like
that. He just told me I was a...

297
00:27:45,756 --> 00:27:48,412
C'mon boys.
Time for you to go home.

298
00:27:48,413 --> 00:27:50,203
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

299
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:54,404
Let's sleep it off
somewhere else.

300
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,436
Excuse me, my friend, have you seen
Mr. Jose Enrique Irigoyen?

301
00:28:02,437 --> 00:28:05,577
From The National?
He left a long time ago.

302
00:28:08,201 --> 00:28:11,011
- Nanette.
- Gerardo. You're still here?

303
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,370
Give me back my tie jewel.

304
00:28:14,924 --> 00:28:16,364
What's a tie jewel?

305
00:28:16,557 --> 00:28:18,221
What you stole from here
a while ago.

306
00:28:18,222 --> 00:28:20,202
- Gerardo.
- Give it to me.

307
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:26,352
Well, don't be like that.
It was just a joke.

308
00:28:26,482 --> 00:28:29,555
Yeah, but between jokes
I've already lost many.

309
00:28:29,556 --> 00:28:32,886
That's why Heriberto says
you have an ugly "keptomania".

310
00:28:32,887 --> 00:28:33,827
"Kleptomania".

311
00:28:35,064 --> 00:28:36,464
Good night, blondie.

312
00:28:52,738 --> 00:28:54,258
Nobody knows anything.

313
00:28:55,555 --> 00:28:58,645
Keep looking for him.
He must be somewhere.

314
00:28:58,789 --> 00:29:00,677
The earth
didn't swallow him.

315
00:29:00,678 --> 00:29:03,975
What a coincidence. The very day
we were going to start pumping oil.

316
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:08,457
Maybe he was so drunk, he's still
sleeping it off at some hotel.

317
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:11,128
We have to find him,
wherever he is.

318
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,090
Hey, boys.

319
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:18,140
Let's move. Search for him
in the oil fields.

320
00:29:19,376 --> 00:29:22,526
- Yes, sir.
- And you, check all the hotels.

321
00:29:22,866 --> 00:29:26,291
And you boys, go across the river.
Who knows if you'll find him there.

322
00:29:26,292 --> 00:29:28,092
- Okay, sir.
- Let's go.

323
00:29:28,213 --> 00:29:31,767
- We're going to the police.
- The police? What for?

324
00:29:31,768 --> 00:29:34,296
In the oil fields there's no more police
than the white guards.

325
00:29:34,297 --> 00:29:37,242
We'll go, anyway.
You stay here just in case.

326
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:38,393
Let's go, boys.

327
00:29:56,997 --> 00:30:00,257
- Sorry to bother you.
- Not at all. Tell me.

328
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:03,977
It's about Mr. José Enrique.
He's nowhere to be found.

329
00:30:03,978 --> 00:30:06,569
We just went to the
police to make a report.

330
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,910
Impossible. He must
be somewhere.

331
00:30:09,644 --> 00:30:13,134
Or maybe he went out on a trip.
He couldn't just disappear.

332
00:30:13,135 --> 00:30:17,103
Well, yes, but the fact remains that we
looked everywhere and he's not there.

333
00:30:17,104 --> 00:30:20,004
He was last seen
going up to your room.

334
00:30:21,459 --> 00:30:23,489
Yes, but he later went home.

335
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:25,099
He was too dizzy.

336
00:30:25,877 --> 00:30:29,943
- So, you don't know anything either?
- Absolutely nothing.

337
00:30:29,944 --> 00:30:32,374
I assure you I'm very
upset now.

338
00:30:33,337 --> 00:30:35,450
Please let me know
if you have any news.

339
00:30:35,451 --> 00:30:36,681
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

340
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:57,119
DISAPPEARANCE OF MR. JOSE ENRIQUE
STILL A MYSTERY

341
00:30:57,319 --> 00:31:01,809
Believed to have suffered an accident
when he couldn't be found

342
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,593
What's wrong with you?

343
00:31:03,594 --> 00:31:05,930
Are you polishing my boots
or reading the newspaper?

344
00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:09,721
- I'm already done, boss.
- "I'm already done, boss".

345
00:31:23,765 --> 00:31:24,755
What happened?

346
00:31:25,111 --> 00:31:27,254
Since he has been
missing for eight days now,

347
00:31:27,255 --> 00:31:29,885
the police gave up
the investigation.

348
00:31:30,009 --> 00:31:31,929
What about the other thing?

349
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:34,746
They've just read
Mr. José Enrique's will.

350
00:31:34,747 --> 00:31:37,085
- Oh, yeah?
- And he named a sister living abroad

351
00:31:37,086 --> 00:31:38,776
as the sole beneficiary.

352
00:31:39,071 --> 00:31:42,143
Do you know what he did
while he was still alive?

353
00:31:42,144 --> 00:31:45,537
He appointed a temporary manager
to run the oil wells.

354
00:31:45,538 --> 00:31:47,348
A temporary manager?
Who?

355
00:31:48,868 --> 00:31:52,998
Who do you think he is, boss?
Demetrio. Isn't that funny?

356
00:31:53,542 --> 00:31:55,122
- The mechanic?
- Yes,

357
00:31:55,976 --> 00:31:58,006
the one who talks like this.

358
00:31:58,377 --> 00:32:03,083
Poor guy. Anyway, I'm sorry
for him because this one doesn't care.

359
00:32:03,084 --> 00:32:05,676
What the heck
could The National mean for him?

360
00:32:05,677 --> 00:32:09,107
- As if he was its owner.
- Let's go, Jeronimo.

361
00:32:23,383 --> 00:32:24,843
Heriberto. Come here.

362
00:32:27,994 --> 00:32:31,355
Here. Read this.
I don't know what we are going to do.

363
00:32:31,356 --> 00:32:34,716
"I arrive today. Mexico train.
Kisses. Mercedes."

364
00:32:34,717 --> 00:32:35,937
The boss' sister.

365
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:39,263
She's chosen the worst
time to come.

366
00:32:39,264 --> 00:32:41,088
Mr. José Enrique didn't want
her to come.

367
00:32:41,089 --> 00:32:44,354
Yes, but the boss didn't have time
to send her the telegram.

368
00:32:44,355 --> 00:32:47,748
We have to take care of her.
She's the boss now.

369
00:32:47,749 --> 00:32:51,270
Gerardo, you know about women.
You'll have to welcome her.

370
00:32:51,271 --> 00:32:54,921
- I have work to do.
- Me? I don't even know her.

371
00:32:55,913 --> 00:32:59,563
It doesn't matter. Tell her what
happened to José Enrique.

372
00:32:59,564 --> 00:33:01,420
She must understand
this is no place for her.

373
00:33:01,421 --> 00:33:03,725
And how the hell do you
expect me to know who she is?

374
00:33:03,726 --> 00:33:07,054
It's very easy, brother.
You know she's from Argentina.

375
00:33:07,055 --> 00:33:09,839
You just pay attention,
and when you hear

376
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,400
"Che", well that's the one, brother.

377
00:33:13,844 --> 00:33:15,054
Look what I get.

378
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,500
"Che", not even one luggage
carrier in this station?

379
00:33:46,501 --> 00:33:49,001
- I was looking for you.
- For me?

380
00:33:49,575 --> 00:33:53,064
- I don't think we know each other.
- I don't have the pleasure yet,

381
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:55,205
but I've come to welcome you.

382
00:33:55,627 --> 00:33:58,827
- You're very kind.
- I should have started by saying

383
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,717
I'm here on behalf of
Mr. José Enrique.

384
00:34:00,718 --> 00:34:03,117
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes. He couldn't do it himself.

385
00:34:03,118 --> 00:34:05,048
- Follow me, please.
- Hey.

386
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:19,319
Well done, Raquela. You just got here
and made friends already.

387
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,072
Did you see that, Mercedes?
He thought I was you.

388
00:34:22,073 --> 00:34:24,474
- Who's that man?
- I don't know.

389
00:34:24,475 --> 00:34:26,045
Your brother sent him.

390
00:34:26,876 --> 00:34:29,181
How strange that José Enrique
didn't come himself.

391
00:34:29,182 --> 00:34:32,606
- Surely you'll see him later.
- Yes, something must have held him.

392
00:34:32,607 --> 00:34:34,687
Let's go then. That nice boy

393
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:37,299
is waiting for us.

394
00:34:37,346 --> 00:34:40,098
When will you be able to see
a man without losing your head?

395
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:40,499
Move.

396
00:34:46,086 --> 00:34:47,476
Here goes the cart.

397
00:34:59,279 --> 00:35:03,120
- This girl comes with you?
- Yes, she's with me, she's my friend.

398
00:35:03,121 --> 00:35:04,401
Ms. Raquela Ortiz.

399
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:11,320
Gerardo Ramirez,
at your service.

400
00:35:12,021 --> 00:35:13,301
Please, follow me.

401
00:35:29,631 --> 00:35:34,101
This one is the largest one
and it has a view of Main Square.

402
00:35:39,141 --> 00:35:41,638
You've been lucky
to find a room available.

403
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,750
It's easier to become
a millionaire in the oil fields,

404
00:35:43,751 --> 00:35:46,001
than to get a room in a hotel.

405
00:35:46,697 --> 00:35:50,127
- Oh, it's here.
- This is the other one, miss.

406
00:35:56,078 --> 00:35:58,478
Can I have a word
with you, miss?

407
00:35:58,479 --> 00:36:01,424
I didn't dare to tell this to
Ms. Mercedes. I'd rather tell it to you.

408
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:03,857
- What is it about?
- I'll explain it to you.

409
00:36:03,858 --> 00:36:04,488
Come in.

410
00:36:21,661 --> 00:36:22,821
You were saying?

411
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:31,009
Mr. José Enrique has been
missing for eight days now.

412
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:33,050
Missing? What are you saying?

413
00:36:35,107 --> 00:36:38,547
- We don't know where he is, miss.
- Impossible.

414
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:42,118
Unfortunately, that's the way it is.
All our efforts to find him

415
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:44,360
have failed and
we fear the worst.

416
00:36:44,361 --> 00:36:47,113
If that's true,
what are the police doing?

417
00:36:47,114 --> 00:36:48,810
The police don't know
anything either.

418
00:36:48,811 --> 00:36:51,901
It's impossible that
no one knows anything.

419
00:37:01,682 --> 00:37:05,002
I assure you we did everything
we could, miss.

420
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:06,071
José Enrique.

421
00:37:08,983 --> 00:37:10,193
And who are you?

422
00:37:10,232 --> 00:37:14,041
We are kind of his heirs now.
Well, not the heirs exactly.

423
00:37:14,042 --> 00:37:18,232
The people in charge of the business,
that's what I meant.

424
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:27,032
How could this have happened?

425
00:37:27,842 --> 00:37:31,235
A man can not disappear
in a city, like a suitcase.

426
00:37:31,236 --> 00:37:33,276
How did he disappear?
Where?

427
00:37:33,636 --> 00:37:37,414
We don't know. Last time
I saw him was in Gulf's casino.

428
00:37:37,415 --> 00:37:41,288
The Grand Casino. He was a bit drunk and
he went up to Camelia's room.

429
00:37:41,289 --> 00:37:41,869
Camelia?

430
00:37:42,985 --> 00:37:44,025
Who's Camelia?

431
00:37:44,618 --> 00:37:46,635
She's a dancer at the casino.
I met her that night,

432
00:37:46,636 --> 00:37:48,076
and I don't know anything else
about her.

433
00:37:48,077 --> 00:37:50,412
I saw them going up the stairs,
and since then

434
00:37:50,413 --> 00:37:54,433
Mr. José Enrique became
invisible as the eyes of an ant.

435
00:37:55,761 --> 00:37:58,162
Mr. José Enrique had decided
his sister wouldn't come here.

436
00:37:58,163 --> 00:38:00,433
You haven't even
been informed.

437
00:38:00,595 --> 00:38:03,860
Because my friend's brother wanted
to bring her here to live with him.

438
00:38:03,861 --> 00:38:07,287
For her own good, convince her
to get away from the oil fields.

439
00:38:07,288 --> 00:38:10,456
Why are you so interested
in seeing her leave?

440
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:12,137
Me? You're wrong, miss.

441
00:38:13,435 --> 00:38:16,865
I'm not interested in having
her stay or leave.

442
00:38:22,144 --> 00:38:25,224
Tell Ms. Mercedes
that I'm at her service.

443
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:26,446
And yours, too.

444
00:38:27,778 --> 00:38:30,848
Who can get mad
at a such a pretty woman?

445
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:43,199
What's wrong?

446
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,060
Mercedes, what happened?

447
00:38:49,102 --> 00:38:53,022
José Enrique is missing.
Probably he got himself killed.

448
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:54,611
Killed? Are you crazy?

449
00:38:55,602 --> 00:38:57,138
That man just told me that.

450
00:38:57,139 --> 00:39:01,049
- What did he tell you?
- That he has just disappeared.

451
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:04,420
Ah, that doesn't mean
he was killed.

452
00:39:04,887 --> 00:39:08,217
Calm down, Mercedes.
We have to think straight.

453
00:39:08,794 --> 00:39:09,844
Think straight.

454
00:39:12,988 --> 00:39:14,728
We have to do something.

455
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:19,646
First, we have to confirm it. And if
it's true, it will be better for you

456
00:39:19,647 --> 00:39:22,689
- not to stay here.
- How can I leave after learning this?

457
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:24,865
We could see later
what can be done.

458
00:39:24,866 --> 00:39:28,260
No, no, Raquela. You go. Your ship
leaves tomorrow and you can't miss it.

459
00:39:28,261 --> 00:39:29,411
I'll stay here.

460
00:39:30,213 --> 00:39:33,639
You can't stay by yourself.
You don't know anybody here

461
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,431
and you can also be in danger.

462
00:39:35,432 --> 00:39:37,417
In spite of everything, I'll stay.

463
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:40,299
That man mentioned
a dancer from the casino.

464
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,373
He said José Enrique was
with her before he disappeared.

465
00:39:43,374 --> 00:39:45,613
I'll go see him and
get the truth out of her.

466
00:39:45,614 --> 00:39:49,616
Whoever she is, she won't be
so stupid as to implicate herself.

467
00:39:49,617 --> 00:39:51,357
Do what I say, Mercedes.

468
00:39:53,235 --> 00:39:55,571
They'll know you're
José Enrique's sister

469
00:39:55,572 --> 00:39:57,556
and you won't find anything.

470
00:39:57,557 --> 00:40:00,227
You made sure nobody
knows who I am.

471
00:40:14,527 --> 00:40:17,207
Can we talk to
Ms. Mercedes Irigoyen?

472
00:40:17,217 --> 00:40:19,497
Mercedes Irigoyen?
Let me check.

473
00:40:21,699 --> 00:40:24,643
Oh, yeah. One of the
two Argentinean girls, right?

474
00:40:24,644 --> 00:40:26,436
- Yes.
- They both left already.

475
00:40:26,437 --> 00:40:28,877
You mean they left the oil fields?

476
00:40:29,191 --> 00:40:32,584
Yes, sir. They said they will board
the South American ship.

477
00:40:32,585 --> 00:40:34,785
The one that left 2 hours ago.

478
00:40:34,794 --> 00:40:38,174
Well, that's the best
that could have happened.

479
00:40:57,014 --> 00:41:00,674
- Could I see the boss?
- Mr. Fabio won't be late.

480
00:41:00,856 --> 00:41:02,766
Thanks. I'll wait for him.

481
00:41:36,012 --> 00:41:38,381
- What?
- That's not the right lyrics.

482
00:41:38,382 --> 00:41:40,852
I'm sure it's the way I sing it.

483
00:41:41,744 --> 00:41:43,823
The cook from the
Foreign Legion was in Argentina

484
00:41:43,824 --> 00:41:45,617
and he used to sing this song.

485
00:41:45,618 --> 00:41:48,598
Whatever. But the song
says another thing.

486
00:41:48,627 --> 00:41:53,117
- It says what I sing.
- It does not. The lyrics are different.

487
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:56,632
The lady is right.
It should be "caracanfunfa".

488
00:41:59,288 --> 00:42:03,418
I was sure it said that.
You've been to Argentina, right?

489
00:42:03,964 --> 00:42:06,972
- I'm Argentinean.
- Anyway, you sing it horribly.

490
00:42:06,973 --> 00:42:09,342
Are you going to teach me
how to sing an Argentinean tango?

491
00:42:09,343 --> 00:42:11,616
Let's hear what she thinks about it,
since she's from there.

492
00:42:11,617 --> 00:42:13,056
- You know how it goes, right?
- Yes.

493
00:42:13,057 --> 00:42:14,977
- Are you a singer?
- Yes.

494
00:42:15,586 --> 00:42:18,467
- Then, show us how it goes.
- No, not now.

495
00:42:18,468 --> 00:42:21,349
- Why not?
- Because I'm waiting for the boss.

496
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:23,320
It doesn't matter. Sing it.

497
00:42:23,462 --> 00:42:26,568
Leave her alone. She doesn't look
the type who sings tangos.

498
00:42:26,569 --> 00:42:28,968
Maybe she just knows
how to sing in church.

499
00:42:28,969 --> 00:42:29,949
You think so?

500
00:42:31,242 --> 00:42:33,572
Please, maestro,
play it for me.

501
00:44:46,486 --> 00:44:49,406
Very well, miss.
You sing it wonderfully.

502
00:44:49,785 --> 00:44:53,017
I'm the owner of this casino.
Nice to meet you.

503
00:44:53,018 --> 00:44:54,008
Raquela Ortiz.

504
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:57,755
Did you come to the oil fields
to work as a performer?

505
00:44:57,756 --> 00:45:00,893
I'm just passing through. I'll be here
only a few days, but I'd like to work.

506
00:45:00,894 --> 00:45:03,534
Consider yourself hired,
Miss Raquela.

507
00:45:04,064 --> 00:45:04,584
Thanks.

508
00:45:06,818 --> 00:45:10,371
I'll assure you my customers
will be happy to see you,

509
00:45:10,372 --> 00:45:12,388
when they see you
and listen to your singing.

510
00:45:12,389 --> 00:45:15,718
- Don't worry about the conditions.
- You won't regret it.

511
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:18,023
This is what's best
about the oil fields.

512
00:45:18,024 --> 00:45:20,873
- Where do you come from?
- Now, from Mexico.

513
00:45:20,874 --> 00:45:24,354
But I'm actually in a tour
out of Buenos Aires.

514
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:26,140
Hey, Camelia. Camelia.

515
00:45:27,629 --> 00:45:30,126
- What do you want?
- Take this girl upstairs, to number 9.

516
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:33,808
- All right, Mr. Fabio.
- I believe you'll like the room.

517
00:45:33,809 --> 00:45:37,019
- Let's go upstairs.
- Make yourself at home.

518
00:45:37,299 --> 00:45:41,079
Camelia will tell you
all you need to know about it.

519
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:09,477
You know I'm the kind of man
that when I say, let's work, I mean it.

520
00:46:09,478 --> 00:46:11,108
But tonight is tonight.

521
00:46:12,135 --> 00:46:14,567
It seems to me
the new manager of The National

522
00:46:14,568 --> 00:46:16,668
gets drunk even with lemonade.

523
00:46:17,193 --> 00:46:19,945
That man doesn't exactly
look like a genius.

524
00:46:19,946 --> 00:46:22,396
The National gets
worse every day.

525
00:46:24,142 --> 00:46:25,072
Good evening.

526
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:33,190
Would you be so kind as to have
a word with me, Mr. Demetrio?

527
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:49,970
Listen, Gerardo.

528
00:46:50,812 --> 00:46:53,980
Don't you think
Mr. Fabio is onto something?

529
00:46:53,981 --> 00:46:57,821
Yes. But some people
don't always get what they want.

530
00:46:57,984 --> 00:47:01,594
- What would he want Demetrio for?
- I don't know.

531
00:47:01,666 --> 00:47:04,566
But don't worry.
Demetrio is not a kid.

532
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,405
We'd talk better inside.

533
00:47:19,468 --> 00:47:22,598
You tell me here
what you want to tell me.

534
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,168
I've heard you'll start
working tomorrow,

535
00:47:29,169 --> 00:47:31,793
and I just wanted
to give some advice.

536
00:47:31,794 --> 00:47:33,054
Don't be a fool.

537
00:47:33,493 --> 00:47:35,573
Mr. José Enrique thought
he was better than the rest of us.

538
00:47:35,574 --> 00:47:37,878
He didn't heed the warnings
of his friends.

539
00:47:37,879 --> 00:47:42,167
You're a man of experience.
What do you get by getting into trouble?

540
00:47:42,168 --> 00:47:46,088
Take advantage of this opportunity
and sell those wells.

541
00:47:46,523 --> 00:47:48,153
Did you finish already?

542
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:50,364
I want you to understand,
Mr. Demetrio.

543
00:47:50,365 --> 00:47:52,221
I have nothing to do
with this matter.

544
00:47:52,222 --> 00:47:54,655
But I wouldn't like to see you
getting a headache over this.

545
00:47:54,656 --> 00:47:58,436
Look, Mr. Fabio. Where I come
from we have a saying,

546
00:47:59,362 --> 00:48:01,603
we can tell the kind bird
from afar.

547
00:48:01,604 --> 00:48:02,524
So, you see.

548
00:48:04,165 --> 00:48:08,415
If you're interested,
we'll start pumping tomorrow at 8:00.

549
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:20,919
Nice to see you, Mr. Manager.

550
00:48:21,071 --> 00:48:23,811
Why so serious?
To hell with business,

551
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:25,544
let's have fun, okay?

552
00:48:25,905 --> 00:48:27,985
I'm afraid I drank too much.

553
00:48:28,275 --> 00:48:31,185
What you drank without me
doesn't count.

554
00:48:33,814 --> 00:48:36,844
So, clean slate,
let's start from scratch.

555
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:39,778
- What's your name, doll?
- Camelia.

556
00:48:40,954 --> 00:48:44,442
- Are you Camelia?
- I like to be with a serious man.

557
00:48:44,443 --> 00:48:45,603
And so handsome.

558
00:48:46,942 --> 00:48:49,502
- Would you dare?
- Let's go, then.

559
00:48:54,209 --> 00:48:57,858
- Where's Heriberto?
- He's trying his luck at the roulette.

560
00:48:57,859 --> 00:49:01,219
Let's see if he hits the jackpot,
like I did.

561
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,680
- You two talked a long time.
- Yeah.

562
00:49:07,913 --> 00:49:10,073
- What did he want?
- Nothing.

563
00:49:15,853 --> 00:49:18,638
Stop drinking now.
You had enough already.

564
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:20,302
This is a new countdown.

565
00:49:20,303 --> 00:49:23,493
Don't you see Camelia and I
are having fun?

566
00:49:24,978 --> 00:49:27,154
Leave him alone.
He's not used to drinking.

567
00:49:27,155 --> 00:49:29,705
Didn't you hear
what the kid said?

568
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:33,590
That's envy. Show him how you
can drink more than all the boys.

569
00:49:33,591 --> 00:49:37,191
Sure. I'll hold more
than him, at the very least.

570
00:49:41,148 --> 00:49:43,708
I liked you since the first
time I saw you.

571
00:49:43,709 --> 00:49:46,237
How lucky I am I came
to the casino tonight.

572
00:49:46,238 --> 00:49:49,858
You had to come, because
someone was expecting you.

573
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:36,158
I finally learned how
they sing in heaven.

574
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:39,359
I imagined you would be far
from the oil fields by now.

575
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,580
- And Ms. Mercedes?
- She left.

576
00:53:41,922 --> 00:53:44,182
So you've been left here alone.

577
00:53:45,539 --> 00:53:46,459
What a pity.

578
00:53:47,589 --> 00:53:49,789
Would you join me at my table?

579
00:53:49,959 --> 00:53:53,459
After all we're old acquaintances,
you could say.

580
00:53:55,946 --> 00:54:00,566
- What are you thinking about?
- That I'll accept your invitation.

581
00:54:10,963 --> 00:54:13,427
- What do you drink?
- Thanks, nothing for me.

582
00:54:13,428 --> 00:54:14,348
As you wish.

583
00:54:15,765 --> 00:54:18,101
Since last night it seems as if
you have something against me.

584
00:54:18,102 --> 00:54:20,672
- Why, Raquela?
- I hardly know you.

585
00:54:21,047 --> 00:54:24,761
I assure you I have no other intention
than to take care of you.

586
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:26,212
Besides, I like you.

587
00:54:28,028 --> 00:54:29,298
That's the truth.

588
00:54:30,173 --> 00:54:35,071
Last night you told me you were one
of the people in charge of The National,

589
00:54:35,072 --> 00:54:38,402
- right?
- Well, the one in charge is Demetrio.

590
00:54:38,465 --> 00:54:41,155
- He's the General Manager.
- Manager?

591
00:54:42,115 --> 00:54:44,644
Who named him to manage
what is not his?

592
00:54:44,645 --> 00:54:48,454
Whoever that was, it doesn't matter.
Let's talk about something else.

593
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:49,205
About you.

594
00:54:50,728 --> 00:54:53,000
I'm asking you who
appointed him.

595
00:54:53,001 --> 00:54:55,754
Every time I see you
I like you more.

596
00:54:55,755 --> 00:54:59,660
Don't be a spitfire and let me
show you that I am your friend.

597
00:54:59,661 --> 00:55:03,054
You're all by yourself here,
and that's not good.

598
00:55:03,055 --> 00:55:06,485
Do you know why you remained
in the oil fields?

599
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:10,185
Because it was God's will
that we met.

600
00:55:11,796 --> 00:55:14,132
Would you come
to my table, Raquela?

601
00:55:14,133 --> 00:55:16,333
I believe the lady is with me.

602
00:55:20,281 --> 00:55:24,026
We haven't finish talking yet.
And I won't leave the casino

603
00:55:24,027 --> 00:55:27,167
without telling you all
I have to tell you.

604
00:56:42,503 --> 00:56:44,135
What are you doing here?

605
00:56:44,136 --> 00:56:45,927
Get out or I'll call someone
to throw you out.

606
00:56:45,928 --> 00:56:48,265
- Please, be quiet.
- I told you to get out.

607
00:56:48,266 --> 00:56:50,786
- Look, miss, please...
- Mr. Fab...

608
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:04,633
Raquela?

609
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:07,619
Raquela.

610
00:57:11,977 --> 00:57:14,937
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were alone.

611
00:57:27,365 --> 00:57:30,385
Angered I like you even more,
I tell you.

612
00:57:36,493 --> 00:57:39,283
Enough.
Now you're gonna listen to me.

613
00:57:41,028 --> 00:57:42,828
You're under arrest, son.

614
00:57:47,651 --> 00:57:48,231
Raquela.

615
00:57:50,393 --> 00:57:52,313
I knew something was wrong.

616
00:57:55,375 --> 00:57:58,695
Calm down, take it easy.
Calm down. Calm down.

617
00:58:00,658 --> 00:58:03,148
No, miss. Not you.
He's all mine.

618
00:58:04,917 --> 00:58:06,357
What are you doing, stupid?

619
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:08,598
I've told you many time
I don't want any trouble here.

620
00:58:08,599 --> 00:58:09,349
Okay boss.

621
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:12,919
I'm just a simple man
doing his job.

622
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:19,516
That cretin is not worthy
of a single bullet.

623
00:58:19,517 --> 00:58:22,270
Throw him out in the alley. If he shows
up again here at the casino,

624
00:58:22,271 --> 00:58:23,358
kill him like a dog.

625
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:27,179
God help you if I see you again.
You're a dead man.

626
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:33,828
Get out or I'll shoot you even
if the boss doesn't want me to do it.

627
00:58:33,829 --> 00:58:37,399
Please, Raquela, calm down.
I beg your forgiveness.

628
00:58:38,215 --> 00:58:41,655
It was all my fault,
for not taking precautions.

629
00:58:43,787 --> 00:58:46,764
I should have known sooner
or later some cretin

630
00:58:46,765 --> 00:58:48,332
would try to bother you.

631
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:52,399
A wretch like that. And I believe
he's even more than a wretch.

632
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,946
Unfortunately, there are plenty
of bandits and killers here, Raquela.

633
00:58:56,947 --> 00:58:58,706
Make no mistake,
he's one of them

634
00:58:58,707 --> 00:59:01,497
and he came here
just looking for you.

635
00:59:02,742 --> 00:59:05,352
That's what I thought at first, too.

636
00:59:05,367 --> 00:59:08,917
But now, I'm not sure.
Everything seems very odd.

637
00:59:09,753 --> 00:59:13,473
Anyway, I'll say it again:
this won't happen again.

638
00:59:14,012 --> 00:59:16,508
Excuse me, I'll go now.
Have a good rest.

639
00:59:16,509 --> 00:59:17,259
Thank you.

640
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:27,714
- Any more news, Rayado?
- Nothing, boss.

641
00:59:27,715 --> 00:59:31,108
But since I'm on my day off,
I decided to check with you, Mr. Fabio.

642
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,485
You know what I mean.

643
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:35,078
Yes. Go see the cashier
and get your money.

644
00:59:35,079 --> 00:59:37,608
- What about that guy?
- We kicked him out.

645
00:59:37,609 --> 00:59:41,039
He's certainly stubborn.
I'll have to be alert.

646
00:59:41,163 --> 00:59:45,403
- He won't go far.
- We should teach him once and for all.

647
00:59:45,645 --> 00:59:50,159
We'll see. If he ever again sets a foot
in the casino, he'll regret it.

648
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:53,990
Won't he try to turn on
the Argentinean's oil wells?

649
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:55,450
Well, who knows.

650
00:59:56,532 --> 00:59:59,668
What if we play the same joke on him
that we played on Mr. José Enrique?

651
00:59:59,669 --> 01:00:04,209
The same one we just played
on the other guy from The National?

652
01:00:05,784 --> 01:00:07,934
Okay, boss, I was just saying.

653
01:00:29,606 --> 01:00:31,910
What happened last night
with Gerardo?

654
01:00:31,911 --> 01:00:35,272
They told me he came
into your room and got out of line?

655
01:00:35,273 --> 01:00:37,705
- He seemed so nice.
- Do you know that man?

656
01:00:37,706 --> 01:00:41,035
Yes, a little bit. I suppose
he got fresh with you.

657
01:00:41,036 --> 01:00:41,836
Who is he?

658
01:00:42,349 --> 01:00:46,126
I only spoke twice with him.
He's a close friend of Heriberto.

659
01:00:46,127 --> 01:00:49,296
Well, I know something else.
I think he likes you.

660
01:00:49,297 --> 01:00:50,641
He told me so himself.

661
01:00:50,642 --> 01:00:53,782
Also, Mr. Fabio is almost
in love with you.

662
01:00:54,163 --> 01:00:56,965
If you put your mind to it,
he'll be putty in your hands.

663
01:00:56,966 --> 01:01:00,852
- Nanette, excuse me for a second.
- Heriberto, what happened to you?

664
01:01:00,853 --> 01:01:04,081
- Where's Camelia?
- Camelia is not here. She went out.

665
01:01:04,082 --> 01:01:06,132
- See you later.
- Heriberto.

666
01:01:09,418 --> 01:01:11,328
Come. I wanna talk to you.

667
01:01:17,824 --> 01:01:22,275
Demetrio was murdered here last night.
We're completely sure of that.

668
01:01:22,276 --> 01:01:23,618
We haven't seen him since.

669
01:01:23,619 --> 01:01:26,599
- Killed here, in the casino?
- Yes, here.

670
01:01:27,078 --> 01:01:30,119
The same way my boss Mr. José Enrique
was killed here before.

671
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,232
And the same way
they'll try to kill Gerardo,

672
01:01:32,233 --> 01:01:34,505
for being the new General Manager
of The National.

673
01:01:34,506 --> 01:01:38,668
If he's so dumb to get inside
this cave of thieves again.

674
01:01:38,669 --> 01:01:40,589
Are you sure of
what you're saying?

675
01:01:40,590 --> 01:01:43,390
Look, miss, you better
shut your mouth.

676
01:01:44,111 --> 01:01:44,811
Heriberto.

677
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:49,553
It's hard to believe that behind
this angelic face hides so much evil.

678
01:01:49,554 --> 01:01:51,795
Last night, you stopped Gerardo
from saving Demetrio

679
01:01:51,796 --> 01:01:55,221
and surely you knew he was getting
murdered somewhere inside the casino.

680
01:01:55,222 --> 01:01:58,902
Upstairs. What else would you expect
from an intimate friend of Mr. Fabio?

681
01:01:58,903 --> 01:02:00,013
Heriberto, wait.

682
01:02:01,305 --> 01:02:02,415
Wait, Heriberto.

683
01:02:07,004 --> 01:02:11,485
Leave me alone. If you were not so
stupid, you could be of some use.

684
01:02:11,486 --> 01:02:12,866
Get out of my way.

685
01:02:23,494 --> 01:02:26,726
Tell the boys to go home.
Just keep the guards here.

686
01:02:26,727 --> 01:02:28,007
Okay, Mr. Gerardo.

687
01:02:40,527 --> 01:02:42,255
You take turns
every eight hours.

688
01:02:42,256 --> 01:02:43,920
Anybody tries to get close,
you shoot them.

689
01:02:43,921 --> 01:02:44,611
Yes, sir.

690
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:53,909
Everything is ready to start
pumping oil tomorrow at 8:00.

691
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:57,912
Poor Demetrio, he won't see the black
geyser springing up from these towers.

692
01:02:57,913 --> 01:02:59,864
And we probably won't either.

693
01:02:59,865 --> 01:03:03,162
We ran out of dynamite, and we're just
halfway through the field, Mr. Gerardo.

694
01:03:03,163 --> 01:03:06,663
- Okay, you two go get more dynamite.
- Yes, sir.

695
01:03:07,935 --> 01:03:09,625
Go with them, Heriberto.

696
01:03:10,047 --> 01:03:13,153
What are you going to do?
You have to be careful, Gerardo.

697
01:03:13,154 --> 01:03:15,362
What needs to happen
will happen.

698
01:03:15,363 --> 01:03:18,013
Listen, if I'm not back by 5:00 am,

699
01:03:21,351 --> 01:03:22,681
blow up the wells.

700
01:03:22,887 --> 01:03:25,319
How am I supposed
to wait until 5:00 am

701
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:27,624
doing nothing,
knowing you're risking your life?

702
01:03:27,625 --> 01:03:31,018
- Let me go with you.
- You'll do as I said, Heriberto.

703
01:03:31,019 --> 01:03:33,729
At 5:00 am,
if I haven't come back.

704
01:03:35,758 --> 01:03:39,183
I'll see you later, and if you want
we can leave the oil fields.

705
01:03:39,184 --> 01:03:43,154
Leaving the oil fields? Look,
Gerardo, you know how much

706
01:03:43,698 --> 01:03:46,067
I respect you and how
fond I'm of you,

707
01:03:46,068 --> 01:03:47,918
but I'd rather stay here.

708
01:03:48,308 --> 01:03:52,502
I was born here, and I don't think
I could live anywhere else.

709
01:03:52,503 --> 01:03:55,463
In case we don't
see each other again...

710
01:03:55,993 --> 01:03:57,853
Now go fetch the dynamite.

711
01:04:03,358 --> 01:04:05,726
There's a lady in the office
who wants to talk to you.

712
01:04:05,727 --> 01:04:07,347
With me, a lady?
Who?

713
01:04:08,672 --> 01:04:11,922
- She didn't tell me her name.
- That's odd.

714
01:04:16,133 --> 01:04:17,873
What are you doing here?

715
01:04:20,487 --> 01:04:23,817
What do you want?
You better leave immediately.

716
01:04:23,881 --> 01:04:28,266
Listen to me. I'm here because I have a
serious matter to talk about with you.

717
01:04:28,267 --> 01:04:32,557
Now I know I was wrong. And I beg you
to forgive me for suspecting

718
01:04:32,558 --> 01:04:34,662
you were responsible for the death
of my brother.

719
01:04:34,663 --> 01:04:36,243
- Your brother?
- Yes.

720
01:04:37,825 --> 01:04:39,100
I'm Mercedes Irigoyen.

721
01:04:39,101 --> 01:04:39,441
You?

722
01:04:41,858 --> 01:04:43,828
What kind of trick is this?

723
01:04:43,893 --> 01:04:47,433
It's not a trick. You confused
my friend with me

724
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:50,897
and I took advantage of that
to stay here incognito.

725
01:04:50,898 --> 01:04:53,776
That's why you treated
Mr. José Enrique's friends so poorly?

726
01:04:53,777 --> 01:04:55,778
I already told you
I didn't know.

727
01:04:55,779 --> 01:04:57,457
I just found the truth last night.

728
01:04:57,458 --> 01:05:00,738
- What truth?
- About Mr. Fabio and everything.

729
01:05:06,825 --> 01:05:12,675
I still don't get why you let all those
thugs jump on top of me if you knew it.

730
01:05:12,883 --> 01:05:15,673
I learned it after they
threw you out.

731
01:05:19,355 --> 01:05:23,545
It's okay. In that case,
there's no need for explanations.

732
01:05:24,652 --> 01:05:26,955
And I'm the one
to ask you to forgive me.

733
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:30,765
Now I know how much I owe you.
I can't thank you enough.

734
01:05:30,766 --> 01:05:35,024
You owe me nothing, miss.
All this is yours and you're my boss.

735
01:05:35,025 --> 01:05:36,525
I'm at your service.

736
01:05:54,748 --> 01:05:55,388
Dynamite?

737
01:05:56,733 --> 01:05:58,909
Your brother ordered us
to blow up the wells

738
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:00,830
before giving them away
to that gang of thieves.

739
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:04,352
I was ready to execute his will.
Now, you tell me.

740
01:06:04,353 --> 01:06:06,093
You do whatever is best.

741
01:06:06,648 --> 01:06:10,368
Poor José Enrique.
I was so eager to see him again.

742
01:06:11,590 --> 01:06:14,636
- You were old friends, right?
- Not exactly.

743
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:17,657
We knew him a few days
before it happened

744
01:06:17,678 --> 01:06:20,008
and we became very
good friends.

745
01:06:21,014 --> 01:06:25,434
If we could read it in the eyes
when someone really loves us.

746
01:06:25,797 --> 01:06:29,587
Sometimes it's hard to know when
something unites us.

747
01:06:30,938 --> 01:06:35,308
I should have understood
it all after you first talked to me.

748
01:06:35,923 --> 01:06:38,996
And I should've tried to make
you understand.

749
01:06:38,997 --> 01:06:41,317
We are both a bit guilty, right?

750
01:06:42,125 --> 01:06:46,325
We were both walking on the same
path without realizing it.

751
01:07:01,564 --> 01:07:05,584
I couldn't have imagined
before coming to the oil fields

752
01:07:06,212 --> 01:07:08,942
that I would be involved
in all this.

753
01:07:09,157 --> 01:07:10,827
And that I'd meet you.

754
01:07:12,455 --> 01:07:16,264
Me neither. I came to see my brother,
to get together with him,

755
01:07:16,265 --> 01:07:19,335
and now you see.
Here we are, you and me,

756
01:07:19,339 --> 01:07:22,259
like arriving by night
to places unknown.

757
01:07:23,181 --> 01:07:25,805
It feels as if fate
had everything ready

758
01:07:25,806 --> 01:07:27,306
just for us to meet.

759
01:07:32,722 --> 01:07:35,154
It smells like kerosene,
doesn't it?

760
01:07:35,155 --> 01:07:38,175
Crude, we're sitting
next to an oil well.

761
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:41,130
Well, this is the end.

762
01:07:43,992 --> 01:07:46,009
Pretty soon the
jungle will devour

763
01:07:46,010 --> 01:07:48,858
even the last traces of what
José Enrique built in this corner

764
01:07:48,859 --> 01:07:51,868
- of the Gulf of Mexico.
- What are you planning to do?

765
01:07:51,869 --> 01:07:54,877
I'll go to the city and leave this
situation in the hands of justice.

766
01:07:54,878 --> 01:07:55,278
Yeah?

767
01:07:56,256 --> 01:07:58,696
My justice doesn't wait that long.

768
01:07:59,585 --> 01:08:01,505
Tonight Mr. Fabio will pay.

769
01:08:02,307 --> 01:08:03,970
You mean you're going
back to the casino?

770
01:08:03,971 --> 01:08:07,365
Your life is in danger and these people
don't mind more killing.

771
01:08:07,366 --> 01:08:10,021
Death comes at its own time,
don't you think?

772
01:08:10,022 --> 01:08:12,592
- Are you set on that?
- Absolutely.

773
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:14,820
In that case, I'll stay, too.

774
01:08:15,006 --> 01:08:18,156
No, Mercedes. Not you.
Leave the oil fields.

775
01:08:19,083 --> 01:08:21,784
I've been cornered and I don't want you
to get mixed up with that.

776
01:08:21,785 --> 01:08:23,755
It's not your problem only.

777
01:08:24,364 --> 01:08:26,516
I beg you, Mercedes.
Get out of here.

778
01:08:26,517 --> 01:08:28,692
When I left the casino
to come to see you,

779
01:08:28,693 --> 01:08:30,876
I thought I would never
return to it.

780
01:08:30,877 --> 01:08:33,186
Now I've decided to stay
and help you.

781
01:08:33,187 --> 01:08:34,467
- Help me?
- Yes.

782
01:08:35,257 --> 01:08:39,086
I don't know what you propose to do,
but you won't be alone.

783
01:08:39,087 --> 01:08:40,307
You see, Gerardo,

784
01:08:41,235 --> 01:08:43,385
our paths
are still the same.

785
01:09:34,037 --> 01:09:35,667
- Did you see?
- What?

786
01:09:38,265 --> 01:09:40,005
That one just walked in.

787
01:09:49,919 --> 01:09:51,019
Get him.
Move.

788
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:37,780
- The Northern Song.
- Calm down, calm down.

789
01:10:40,956 --> 01:10:45,306
Since they don't pay attention to us,
I'll sing it for you.

790
01:10:53,026 --> 01:10:55,234
I'll dedicate it to
my good friend, Mr. Fabio.

791
01:10:55,235 --> 01:10:57,732
And be aware that I'm actually
saving you from a tight spot.

792
01:10:57,733 --> 01:11:03,043
Because if it wasn't for me, tonight
they would have destroyed your casino.

793
01:13:14,181 --> 01:13:16,914
That's the way to sing.
Now come have fun with us.

794
01:13:16,915 --> 01:13:18,799
I'll be back in a moment.
Wait.

795
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,310
Very good, very good.

796
01:13:27,834 --> 01:13:33,304
Last night I was thrown away from the
casino just because I came to see her.

797
01:13:33,468 --> 01:13:36,668
How can you blame me
for liking my darling so much.

798
01:13:36,669 --> 01:13:39,775
I'm here to see
if you throw me out again.

799
01:13:39,776 --> 01:13:42,592
You're planning also to visit her
in her room tonight?

800
01:13:42,593 --> 01:13:43,913
Maybe I'll do it.

801
01:13:45,539 --> 01:13:49,220
Very well said, my friend. But now
come have a drink with us.

802
01:13:49,221 --> 01:13:51,205
- Let's go then.
- And you know you're not alone.

803
01:13:51,206 --> 01:13:54,023
- Because men get along with men.
- That's true, always.

804
01:13:54,024 --> 01:13:57,464
- Come with us.
- I was out-numbered last night.

805
01:13:57,641 --> 01:14:00,522
Those white guards,
they just grabbed me and...

806
01:14:00,523 --> 01:14:03,503
Nothing will happen, Raquela.
Don't worry.

807
01:14:04,237 --> 01:14:06,414
You can go up to your room,
whenever you feel like it.

808
01:14:06,415 --> 01:14:10,955
Perhaps it will be best to finish
this matter once and for all.

809
01:14:14,094 --> 01:14:16,811
That's right. Another drink
and people to say 'cheers'.

810
01:14:16,812 --> 01:14:18,864
To the honor of having
you with us.

811
01:14:18,865 --> 01:14:20,615
To good friends.
Cheers.

812
01:14:28,514 --> 01:14:32,464
Excuse me. I'll drink
double later. I'll be back soon.

813
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:51,239
This is going better
than I expected.

814
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:53,800
Mr. Fabio set everything
up for me.

815
01:15:01,447 --> 01:15:04,977
He set it up for me,
'cause he's a good friend.

816
01:15:07,089 --> 01:15:09,424
And he realized
how much I liked you.

817
01:15:09,425 --> 01:15:12,975
I swear, tonight is the biggest
night of my life.

818
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:18,192
And now, sugar, we're alone at last.
Let's see who dares to throw me out.

819
01:15:18,193 --> 01:15:21,913
I missed your kisses.
And I won't die without them.

820
01:15:22,707 --> 01:15:23,757
You understand?

821
01:15:27,164 --> 01:15:29,904
Come here, sugar.
Where are you going?

822
01:15:53,690 --> 01:15:56,020
C'mon, Rayado.
Drop the package.

823
01:15:58,841 --> 01:16:00,051
See who that is.

824
01:16:05,064 --> 01:16:06,816
We're here for the package.

825
01:16:06,817 --> 01:16:09,081
- There's no package.
- No package?

826
01:16:09,082 --> 01:16:11,992
- No.
- All right, honey, don't get mad.

827
01:16:14,966 --> 01:16:16,656
They changed the orders.

828
01:16:18,584 --> 01:16:20,856
It's better if we don't have
a dead body tonight.

829
01:16:20,857 --> 01:16:21,597
Let's go.

830
01:16:47,689 --> 01:16:50,719
You're a bit nervous.
Did anything happen?

831
01:16:57,101 --> 01:16:59,277
That's the way
I wanted you, murderer.

832
01:16:59,278 --> 01:17:02,159
I knew that one of us wouldn't
survive the night.

833
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:05,120
Your time has come
and you're gonna pay.

834
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:18,457
I'm sorry, Mercedes. I know you'd rather
not see your brother's killer again.

835
01:17:18,458 --> 01:17:21,468
So you tried to use as bait
no less than

836
01:17:22,588 --> 01:17:24,158
José Enrique's sister.

837
01:17:28,223 --> 01:17:30,663
Listen to me first.
Listen to me.

838
01:17:30,784 --> 01:17:33,505
Listen to me, miss.
I'm not the one responsible

839
01:17:33,506 --> 01:17:35,938
for your brother's death.
I can prove it.

840
01:17:35,939 --> 01:17:40,485
What would I get from it? I'm just
a working man, without enemies.

841
01:17:40,486 --> 01:17:43,886
- I just followed orders.
- Orders? Whose orders?

842
01:17:44,168 --> 01:17:45,838
I can't tell you that.

843
01:17:47,306 --> 01:17:50,795
Have mercy on me. I'll give you
everything I have.

844
01:17:50,796 --> 01:17:54,381
I'll make you rich. It's not my fault.
There are others who are responsible.

845
01:17:54,382 --> 01:17:57,942
- Who? Speak.
- It's very hard to explain. Others.

846
01:17:58,192 --> 01:17:59,242
- Speak.
- No.

847
01:17:59,921 --> 01:18:03,282
The ones responsible
are... the trust, the company people.

848
01:18:03,283 --> 01:18:07,764
The company people? What about
the orders, who gave them to you?

849
01:18:07,765 --> 01:18:09,935
- Van Eckerman.
- Van Eckerman?

850
01:18:12,535 --> 01:18:14,155
And who's that person?

851
01:18:14,169 --> 01:18:17,319
The CEO of the company.
Everybody knows him.

852
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:20,092
- Where does he live?
- In the house at Main Square.

853
01:18:20,093 --> 01:18:21,313
The yellow house.

854
01:18:29,890 --> 01:18:32,810
- Who's that?
- Ms. Raquela, your number.

855
01:18:35,076 --> 01:18:36,286
Go, don't worry.

856
01:22:54,902 --> 01:22:56,822
Besides, you won't be
able to escape.

857
01:22:56,823 --> 01:22:58,615
My signature will
be useless to you.

858
01:22:58,616 --> 01:23:01,721
But before that, I'll pump all six
bullets from my gun in your head,

859
01:23:01,722 --> 01:23:04,212
if you don't write me
that paper.

860
01:23:05,437 --> 01:23:09,309
Don't go away. It will just take
a second. It's for the publicity.

861
01:23:09,310 --> 01:23:10,718
Please, just one moment, miss.

862
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:13,969
Right here. Good.
It's a photo for the news.

863
01:23:50,037 --> 01:23:52,177
Open the door or we'll shoot.

864
01:23:56,921 --> 01:23:58,137
Open or we'll shoot.

865
01:23:58,138 --> 01:23:59,897
I'll be the one shooting.

866
01:23:59,898 --> 01:24:01,288
Stay where you are.

867
01:24:05,148 --> 01:24:07,398
Don't move or
I'll shoot you.

868
01:24:21,222 --> 01:24:22,022
He's here.

869
01:24:27,753 --> 01:24:30,323
Now, Rayado
got scratched all right.

870
01:24:33,389 --> 01:24:34,599
What's going on?

871
01:24:34,863 --> 01:24:37,358
We captured that guy.
He's in your room upstairs.

872
01:24:37,359 --> 01:24:39,727
Mr. Fabio was shot
and I'm going to get the doctor.

873
01:24:39,728 --> 01:24:41,648
And what did you do
to the man who shot him?

874
01:24:41,649 --> 01:24:44,882
Nothing yet, in case Mr. Fabio
wants to talk to him

875
01:24:44,883 --> 01:24:46,323
before sending him out
to the next life.

876
01:24:46,324 --> 01:24:48,372
And that will have to wait
until he regains consciousness.

877
01:24:48,373 --> 01:24:49,123
Excuse me.

878
01:25:25,738 --> 01:25:27,498
Good evening, Miss Raquela.

879
01:25:27,499 --> 01:25:29,547
Take me to the house
of Mr. Van Eckerman.

880
01:25:29,548 --> 01:25:31,468
To the house of Main Square?

881
01:25:31,469 --> 01:25:34,669
- Take me to Mr. Van Eckerman's house.
- Go.

882
01:26:03,584 --> 01:26:04,831
What?
What's happening?

883
01:26:04,832 --> 01:26:07,332
A lady wants to see
you, urgently.

884
01:26:07,842 --> 01:26:10,690
- A lady?
- She says she's Mercedes Irigoyen.

885
01:26:10,691 --> 01:26:12,261
Owner of The National.

886
01:26:13,477 --> 01:26:16,107
- The National, you said?
- Yes, sir.

887
01:26:16,679 --> 01:26:17,769
It's okay, go.

888
01:26:48,313 --> 01:26:49,400
Take a seat, miss.

889
01:26:49,401 --> 01:26:51,611
Thanks. I'm all right standing.

890
01:26:52,283 --> 01:26:55,452
- So, tell me.
- You know who I am, don't you?

891
01:26:55,453 --> 01:26:58,494
I'm the sister of Engineer
Mr. José Enrique Irigoyen.

892
01:26:58,495 --> 01:27:00,670
The new owner
of The National.

893
01:27:00,671 --> 01:27:02,411
Nice to meet you.
So...

894
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:05,217
I'm perfectly aware
that my brother was murdered

895
01:27:05,218 --> 01:27:09,059
because he wouldn't yield
to the threats of the oil companies.

896
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:12,933
I also know that last night another man
was killed for the same reason.

897
01:27:12,934 --> 01:27:16,999
I don't understand a single word
of what you're saying, miss.

898
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,590
Excuse me, you're a bit upset
and I'm very busy.

899
01:27:21,483 --> 01:27:22,643
Just one minute.

900
01:27:24,429 --> 01:27:26,339
You have to hear me first.

901
01:27:26,477 --> 01:27:28,206
I just came here to ask you
for your help

902
01:27:28,207 --> 01:27:31,375
to save someone who's in danger.
Only you can do that.

903
01:27:31,376 --> 01:27:32,946
Someone... Who's that?

904
01:27:34,162 --> 01:27:37,395
Gerardo Ramirez,
temporary manager of The National.

905
01:27:37,396 --> 01:27:38,716
I don't know him.

906
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:41,941
He also tried to confront
the oil companies.

907
01:27:41,942 --> 01:27:45,848
Another naive man who believed
that the weak can fight the strong.

908
01:27:45,849 --> 01:27:49,498
An old stupidity that has caused
much pain in the world.

909
01:27:49,499 --> 01:27:51,239
Let's talk slower, miss.

910
01:27:52,252 --> 01:27:54,872
You seem to be
an intelligent woman.

911
01:27:55,262 --> 01:27:56,412
Let's sit down.

912
01:28:00,865 --> 01:28:04,673
Doesn't it seem absurd to you
that some people are willing

913
01:28:04,674 --> 01:28:07,354
to bump their heads
against the wall?

914
01:28:07,524 --> 01:28:10,904
- Absurd, at least for now.
- For now, you say?

915
01:28:11,783 --> 01:28:15,103
Yes. Just for now,
because you have the power.

916
01:28:15,209 --> 01:28:17,899
A power that
changed into civilization

917
01:28:18,986 --> 01:28:20,940
the wilderness of
these places, miss.

918
01:28:20,941 --> 01:28:24,493
A power that brought hatred
and desperation to the world.

919
01:28:24,494 --> 01:28:26,703
I think you're exaggerating, miss.

920
01:28:26,704 --> 01:28:29,674
Anyway, what's the reason
for your visit?

921
01:28:30,161 --> 01:28:33,842
You're interested in The National,
and I'm here to sell it to you.

922
01:28:33,843 --> 01:28:35,863
Why do you want to sell it?

923
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:38,900
Because only in this way can I save
the man who I want to save.

924
01:28:38,901 --> 01:28:40,591
Aha. I understand, miss.

925
01:28:41,752 --> 01:28:45,782
Your proposition could be
of some interest to my company.

926
01:28:45,914 --> 01:28:49,051
In this case, we could get together
here again tomorrow morning

927
01:28:49,052 --> 01:28:52,253
- to discuss the deal.
- No, it has to be done right now.

928
01:28:52,254 --> 01:28:54,077
Do you understand?
He's held at the casino

929
01:28:54,078 --> 01:28:55,934
by the same thugs who
killed my brother.

930
01:28:55,935 --> 01:28:57,205
I like you, miss.

931
01:28:59,906 --> 01:29:03,206
So I'll solve this matter
as my gift to you.

932
01:29:10,888 --> 01:29:14,718
That's why they say women
are the salt of the earth.

933
01:29:20,205 --> 01:29:23,645
- Bring me the file of The National.
- Yes, sir.

934
01:29:24,688 --> 01:29:27,488
There are still
a few more formalities,

935
01:29:28,305 --> 01:29:29,682
that we can resolve tomorrow,

936
01:29:29,683 --> 01:29:32,183
the next day or
whenever you want.

937
01:29:38,359 --> 01:29:40,939
You understand,
business is business.

938
01:29:41,657 --> 01:29:44,877
- So, please, sign here.
- What about Gerardo?

939
01:29:46,429 --> 01:29:48,540
Who can guarantee nothing
will happen to him?

940
01:29:48,541 --> 01:29:52,254
You're right. Go to
the casino and bring here Mr...

941
01:29:52,255 --> 01:29:54,485
- Gerardo Ramirez.
- Right away.

942
01:30:09,449 --> 01:30:11,209
TRAIN SCHEDULE
NORTHBOUND

943
01:30:14,178 --> 01:30:14,918
Let's go.

944
01:30:22,633 --> 01:30:25,183
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

945
01:30:38,829 --> 01:30:40,809
- Did you hear that?
- Yes.

946
01:30:41,811 --> 01:30:43,971
- The wells.
- I had forgotten

947
01:30:44,066 --> 01:30:46,192
- they were going to blow up.
- I didn't.

948
01:30:46,193 --> 01:30:49,347
That's why it was so urgent for me
to close the deal with Van Eckerman.

949
01:30:49,348 --> 01:30:53,008
But you did it knowing they
were going to blow up?

950
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:57,110
That's not good.

951
01:31:00,266 --> 01:31:02,826
We won something out
of our defeat.

952
01:31:04,188 --> 01:31:05,638
- I did.
- Me, too.
