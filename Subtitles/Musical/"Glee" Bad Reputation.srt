00:00:02,258 --> 00:00:03,725
<i>So here's whad
on Glee:</i>

2
00:00:03,792 --> 00:00:05,693
<i>Jesse left Vocal Adrenaline...
JESSE: I'm a star.</i>

3
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:07,629
<i>You can learn from me.
...so he could date Rachel, so now he's</i>

4
00:00:07,696 --> 00:00:09,397
<i>part of the glee club.
Great to have you here.</i>

5
00:00:09,465 --> 00:00:10,865
<i>And they're
the new power couple.</i>

6
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:12,300
<i>Previous power couples:
Rachel and Finn...</i>

7
00:00:12,368 --> 00:00:14,335
I made us his and her
relationship calendars.

8
00:00:14,403 --> 00:00:15,670
<i>Oh.
...also, Rachel and Puck.</i>

9
00:00:15,738 --> 00:00:17,238
Want to make out?
Sure.

10
00:00:18,641 --> 00:00:20,108
<i>Will still
has a crush on Emma...</i>

11
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:22,677
I could just lean over and kiss
you if I want to. And I want to.

12
00:00:22,745 --> 00:00:24,846
<i>But he hasn't divorced
Terri yet, and he made out</i>

13
00:00:24,913 --> 00:00:26,314
<i>with the coach
of Vocal Adrenaline.</i>

14
00:00:26,382 --> 00:00:28,683
Most of the show choir directors
I make out with are gay.

15
00:00:28,751 --> 00:00:31,719
<i>And Sue?
Sloppy freak
show babies!</i>

16
00:00:31,787 --> 00:00:33,288
<i>Still just kind of
angry about everything.</i>

17
00:00:33,355 --> 00:00:33,521
SUE:
Who wants a piece of it? Huh?

18
00:00:35,057 --> 00:00:37,959
<i>And that's what
you missed on Glee.</i>

19
00:00:38,027 --> 00:00:40,628
{laughter}

20
00:00:40,696 --> 00:00:41,829
{"Physical" by
Olivia Newton-John playing}

21
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,667
What's so funny?

22
00:00:45,734 --> 00:00:47,702
You guys aren't watching
the video of me falling

23
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,837
off stage at my first TinyTots
beauty pageant, are you?

24
00:00:49,905 --> 00:00:51,005
That was Carrot Top funny

25
00:00:51,073 --> 00:00:52,507
compared to this comedic
tour de force.

26
00:00:52,574 --> 00:00:55,076
JESSIE: That's Olivia
Newton-John's "Physical."

27
00:00:55,144 --> 00:00:57,612
It was pretty groundbreaking
subject matter at the time,

28
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,214
considering it's depiction
of fluid sexuality.

29
00:01:00,282 --> 00:01:01,182
MERCEDES:
Oh, my good...
{laughter}

30
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,451
Wait, wait.

31
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:04,786
That's not Olivia Newton-John.

32
00:01:04,853 --> 00:01:07,088
That's, that's
Sue Sylvester.

33
00:01:07,156 --> 00:01:08,623
Where did you get this?

34
00:01:08,691 --> 00:01:10,258
I can tell you
that I certainly did not

35
00:01:10,326 --> 00:01:11,726
steal it from her locked
file cabinet yesterday

36
00:01:11,794 --> 00:01:13,161
when she sent me
back to her office

37
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:15,430
to get her hormone
replacement injection

38
00:01:15,497 --> 00:01:17,298
during Cheerios!
practice.

39
00:01:17,366 --> 00:01:18,599
{laughter}

40
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:20,134
Wait,

41
00:01:20,202 --> 00:01:21,436
did she just do
the Cabbage Patch?

42
00:01:21,503 --> 00:01:23,071
{laughter}

43
00:01:23,138 --> 00:01:24,372
I'm posting this
on YouTube.

44
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,440
RACHEL:
No, no, wait, wait.

45
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:26,407
Do you think
that's a good idea?

46
00:01:26,475 --> 00:01:28,309
She might kill us.

47
00:01:28,377 --> 00:01:30,211
Oh, let her get a
taste of some of

48
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:31,913
the humiliation
she put us through.

49
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,448
JESSIE:
I'm with Finn.

50
00:01:33,515 --> 00:01:36,184
You guys need to stop being such
asses and start being bad-asses.

51
00:01:36,251 --> 00:01:38,186
{laughter}

52
00:01:38,253 --> 00:01:41,622
Ten bucks it goes
viral by lunch.

53
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,959
¶¶ Let's get animal, animal... ¶¶

54
00:01:45,027 --> 00:01:47,662
Hey, Ms. Sylvester.

55
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,030
Let's get physical.

56
00:01:49,098 --> 00:01:51,666
Not really my type,
but I like that attitude.

57
00:01:51,734 --> 00:01:52,934
Hey, Sue!

58
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:54,869
Let's get animal!

59
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:00,775
{school bell ringing}

60
00:02:00,843 --> 00:02:04,679
That glee club stole my private
property and posted it online.

61
00:02:04,747 --> 00:02:06,080
And as soon as I figure out

62
00:02:06,148 --> 00:02:07,148
the difference between
slander and libel,

63
00:02:07,216 --> 00:02:08,316
I'm filing a lawsuit.

64
00:02:08,384 --> 00:02:09,550
WILL:
Sue, don't you think

65
00:02:09,618 --> 00:02:10,985
you might be
overstating this a little?

66
00:02:11,053 --> 00:02:13,154
Will, I may buy
a small diaper for your chin,

67
00:02:13,222 --> 00:02:14,922
because it looks like
a baby's ass.

68
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,393
That video has received
over 170,000 comments.

69
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,562
I took the liberty of
printing out a few.

70
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,498
"The man in this video
looks like

71
00:02:23,565 --> 00:02:25,867
the champion cheerleading coach
Sue Sylvester."

72
00:02:25,934 --> 00:02:27,668
That was particularly hurtful.

73
00:02:27,736 --> 00:02:29,670
{clears throat}
You know, Sue, there are a lot

74
00:02:29,738 --> 00:02:31,439
of people at this school
who dislike you.

75
00:02:31,507 --> 00:02:32,640
My kids don't do
stuff like this.

76
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:33,808
Is that so?

77
00:02:33,876 --> 00:02:36,544
Exhibit B.

78
00:02:37,746 --> 00:02:39,447
What's a "Glist"?

79
00:02:39,515 --> 00:02:41,048
It's the "Glee List" William.

80
00:02:41,116 --> 00:02:43,017
It's a weekly ranking
of your glee club,

81
00:02:43,085 --> 00:02:44,819
based on a hotness quotient
of sexual promiscuity.

82
00:02:44,887 --> 00:02:47,388
It was posted all over
the school an hour ago.

83
00:02:47,456 --> 00:02:48,556
Apparently, you get a point

84
00:02:48,624 --> 00:02:50,691
for each act of
perpetuated depravity.

85
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:53,761
What makes you think
my kids did this?

86
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:55,430
This Glist was made
on a library computer

87
00:02:55,497 --> 00:02:57,932
using the pass code "gleeclub."

88
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,002
Your glee club is
a petri dish of
sexual depravity.

89
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:02,470
Sue's right, Will.

90
00:03:02,538 --> 00:03:04,405
Why, only last year,
a list was posted

91
00:03:04,473 --> 00:03:07,074
ranking McKinley's
ten ugliest Gingers.

92
00:03:07,142 --> 00:03:08,443
And the perpetrator
would have

93
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,911
been expelled
had it not turned out

94
00:03:09,978 --> 00:03:11,579
to be a member of the faculty!

95
00:03:11,647 --> 00:03:13,014
I stand by that list.

96
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:14,649
William, this is serious.

97
00:03:14,716 --> 00:03:17,452
I cannot have an environment
that sexualizes children

98
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,287
and damages their self-esteem!

99
00:03:24,059 --> 00:03:25,960
You know, a week ago,
had I fod a list

100
00:03:26,028 --> 00:03:27,929
that so degraded the glee club,
I would've been embarrassed

101
00:03:27,996 --> 00:03:29,230
I was beaten to the punch.

102
00:03:29,298 --> 00:03:30,731
But now I know the
white-hot shame

103
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,468
of public rebuke-- that
pain is indescribable.

104
00:03:33,535 --> 00:03:36,103
William, last year,
at West Dayton High,

105
00:03:36,171 --> 00:03:37,572
a photo circulated of

106
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,440
school superintendent...
And what was
he wearing?

107
00:03:39,508 --> 00:03:41,409
Women's lingerie.
And what was
he riding?

108
00:03:41,477 --> 00:03:43,211
Pony!
And who was
expelled?

109
00:03:43,278 --> 00:03:44,445
The entire school!

110
00:03:44,513 --> 00:03:45,913
The entire school
was expelled, will!

111
00:03:45,981 --> 00:03:47,648
What does that
have to do with me?

112
00:03:47,716 --> 00:03:49,817
You must find out
who made the Glist

113
00:03:49,885 --> 00:03:51,586
and suspend them before
they post another one,

114
00:03:51,653 --> 00:03:53,955
or I'm holding the entire
glee club responsible!

115
00:03:54,022 --> 00:03:55,223
Are you serious?

116
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,891
Deadly serious!

117
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,026
I cannot have these
shenanigans at this school!

118
00:03:59,094 --> 00:04:01,462
<i>He cannot have these
shenanigans at this school!</i>

119
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,705
Who did it?

120
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,074
This is serious.

121
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:15,243
Principal Figgins is threatening
to disband the club.

122
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,811
Why are we playing this game?

123
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,279
We all know it was Puck.

124
00:04:18,347 --> 00:04:19,981
Back off.
I didn't do squat.

125
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:21,883
Then why is your girlfriend
first on the Glist?

126
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,384
And why am I last?

127
00:04:23,452 --> 00:04:25,720
Aside from the fact that I
refused to put out for you.

128
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:29,290
Okay, enough! No one is
accusing anyone of anything.

129
00:04:29,358 --> 00:04:30,625
Puck, seriously,
did you do it?

130
00:04:30,692 --> 00:04:31,692
I said no.

131
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,160
I'm a delinquent, sure.

132
00:04:33,228 --> 00:04:34,362
I like setting
stuff on fire

133
00:04:34,429 --> 00:04:35,796
and ating up
people I don't know.

134
00:04:35,864 --> 00:04:37,665
I own at.
But I'm not a liar.

135
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:39,734
All right, here's
the important point.

136
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:42,103
Between this and posting
Coach Sylvester's

137
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,539
personal video on YouTube,
you guys are getting

138
00:04:44,606 --> 00:04:45,973
a pretty bad
reputation.

139
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,708
Why is that a bad thing?

140
00:04:47,776 --> 00:04:49,243
Maybe if we seem more dangerous,

141
00:04:49,311 --> 00:04:51,646
people would stop flushing
my glasses down the toilet.

142
00:04:51,713 --> 00:04:53,781
Look, things are
hard right now.

143
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:55,182
I get it.
You're under a lot

144
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,417
of pressure
with regionals coming up.

145
00:04:56,485 --> 00:04:58,452
And I know that winning
sectionals hasn't had

146
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,620
the positive effect
on your popularity

147
00:04:59,688 --> 00:05:01,188
that a lot of you
thought it would.

148
00:05:01,256 --> 00:05:05,126
But becoming what you despise
is not the answer.

149
00:05:05,193 --> 00:05:06,961
Man, this song is wack.

150
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:08,062
No, it's not.

151
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,130
It's a terrific song

152
00:05:09,197 --> 00:05:10,765
on a long list
of top hits that,

153
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:13,067
because of time or some
bad press, has become a joke.

154
00:05:13,135 --> 00:05:14,902
And, like you guys,
it's time to start

155
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,138
rehabilitating
its bad reputation.

156
00:05:17,205 --> 00:05:18,472
The assignment
for the week

157
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,776
is for all of you
to find songs like this,

158
00:05:21,843 --> 00:05:23,678
mine them for what works

159
00:05:23,745 --> 00:05:25,146
and make them great again.

160
00:05:25,213 --> 00:05:26,747
And then, hopefully,

161
00:05:26,815 --> 00:05:28,883
can apply this musical lesson
to your own lives.

162
00:05:28,951 --> 00:05:31,452
This song should be arrested
for the crime of sucking.

163
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,386
{laughter}
Mm-hmm.

164
00:05:32,454 --> 00:05:33,921
You want to bet?

165
00:05:33,989 --> 00:05:35,990
{oohing, murmuring}
Oh, no, he didn't.

166
00:05:36,058 --> 00:05:37,291
Hit it.

167
00:05:38,727 --> 00:05:39,694

Yo, I don't know ¶¶

177
00:05:57,045 --> 00:05:58,379
¶¶ Turn off the lights, huh ¶¶

178
00:05:58,447 --> 00:05:59,413
¶¶ And I'll glow,
to the extreme ¶¶

179
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:01,115
¶¶ I rock a mic like a vandal ¶¶

180
00:06:01,183 --> 00:06:03,184
¶¶ Light up a stage
and wax a chump like a candle ¶¶

181
00:06:03,251 --> 00:06:04,986
¶¶ Dance, go rush
the speaker that booms ¶¶

182
00:06:05,053 --> 00:06:07,121
¶¶ I'm killing your brain
like a poisonous mushroom ¶¶

183
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:09,557
¶¶ Deadly, when I play
a dope melody ¶¶

184
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,525
¶¶ Anything less than
the best is a felony ¶¶

185
00:06:11,593 --> 00:06:12,860
¶¶ Love it or leave it,
you better gangway ¶¶

186
00:06:12,928 --> 00:06:14,061
¶¶ You better
hit the bull's-eye ¶¶

187
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:15,563
¶¶ The kid don't play ¶¶

188
00:06:15,631 --> 00:06:17,164
¶¶ If there was a problem,
yo, I'll solve it ¶¶

189
00:06:17,232 --> 00:06:19,300
¶¶ Check out the hook
while my DJ revolves it ¶¶

190
00:06:19,368 --> 00:06:21,002
¶¶ Ice, Ice, baby ¶¶

191
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:22,236
Oh!

192
00:06:22,304 --> 00:06:24,605
¶¶ Vanilla Ice, Ice, baby ¶¶

193
00:06:24,673 --> 00:06:27,274
{whooping}
Verse two!

194
00:06:27,342 --> 00:06:29,276
¶¶ Take heed
'cause I'm a lyrical poet ¶¶

195
00:06:29,344 --> 00:06:31,112
¶¶ Miami's on the scene just
in case you didn't know it ¶¶

196
00:06:31,179 --> 00:06:33,781
¶¶ My town that created all th
bass sound, enough to shake ¶¶

197
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:35,750
¶¶ And kick holes in the ground
'cause my style's ¶¶

198
00:06:35,817 --> 00:06:37,451
¶¶ Like a chemical spill ¶¶

199
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,953
¶¶ Feasible rhymes
you can vision and feel ¶¶

200
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:41,355
¶¶ Conducted and formed,
that's a hell of a concept ¶¶

201
00:06:41,423 --> 00:06:43,958
¶¶ We make it hype
and you want to step with this ¶¶

202
00:06:44,026 --> 00:06:45,459
¶¶ Shay plays on the fade,
slice like a ninja ¶¶

203
00:06:45,527 --> 00:06:46,761
¶¶ Cut like a razor blade ¶¶

204
00:06:46,828 --> 00:06:48,596
¶¶ So fast,
other DJs say, "damn" ¶¶

205
00:06:48,664 --> 00:06:50,131
¶¶ If my rhyme was a drug ¶¶

206
00:06:50,198 --> 00:06:51,465
¶¶ I'd sell it by the gram,
keep my composure ¶¶

207
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:52,800
¶¶ When it's time to get loose ¶¶

208
00:06:52,868 --> 00:06:55,036
¶¶ Magnetized by the mic
while I kick my juice ¶¶

209
00:06:55,103 --> 00:06:57,672
¶¶ If there was a problem,
yo, I'll solve it ¶¶

210
00:06:57,739 --> 00:06:59,173
¶¶ Check out the hook
while my DJ revolves it ¶¶

211
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:00,508
¶¶ Ice, Ice, baby ¶¶

212
00:07:00,575 --> 00:07:02,009
{rhythmic shouting}

213
00:07:02,077 --> 00:07:04,045
¶¶ Vanilla Ice, Ice, baby ¶¶

214
00:07:04,112 --> 00:07:06,614
{whooping}

215
00:07:06,682 --> 00:07:08,749
¶¶ Vanilla Ice, Ice, baby ¶¶

216
00:07:10,252 --> 00:07:12,019
¶¶ Vanilla Ice, Ice, baby ¶¶

217
00:07:12,087 --> 00:07:14,288
¶¶ Too cold, too cold ¶¶

218
00:07:14,356 --> 00:07:16,624
¶¶ Vanilla Ice, Ice, baby. ¶¶

219
00:07:16,692 --> 00:07:17,825
Yo, man, let's get out of here.

220
00:07:17,893 --> 00:07:19,760
Word to your mother.

221
00:07:19,828 --> 00:07:20,961
{music stops, laughter}

222
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:22,897
This song is officially paroled!

223
00:07:22,964 --> 00:07:23,898
{cheering}

224
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:24,899
Right, Jessie?

225
00:07:24,966 --> 00:07:26,333
You got me?

226
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:27,702
{bell ringing}

227
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:32,339
{murmuring}

228
00:07:32,407 --> 00:07:36,310
<i>SUE:
This is not happening.</i>

229
00:07:36,378 --> 00:07:39,914
<i>The cruel slow-motion laughter
is just your imagination.</i>

230
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:42,717
<i>You're Sue Sylvester-- legend.</i>

231
00:07:42,784 --> 00:07:44,285
<i>They're not laughing at you</i>

232
00:07:44,352 --> 00:07:46,787
<i>because of
your "Physical" video.</i>

233
00:07:46,855 --> 00:07:51,292
<i>Just calmly pour yourself
a cup of joe and focus.</i>

234
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:53,527
<i>Wait, what's that smell?</i>

235
00:07:53,595 --> 00:07:55,963
<i>Dear God, that's coffee.</i>

236
00:07:56,031 --> 00:07:58,065
<i>It's usually masked
by the smell of fear.</i>

237
00:07:58,133 --> 00:08:01,302
<i>Sweet merciful Lord,
this is happening!</i>

238
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:04,105
<i>You're being laughed at
in slow motion</i>

239
00:08:04,172 --> 00:08:06,707
<i>by a roomful of inferiors
whom you used to terrify.</i>

240
00:08:09,111 --> 00:08:11,245
The name is Brenda.

241
00:08:11,313 --> 00:08:12,646
Brenda Castle.

242
00:08:12,714 --> 00:08:15,449
I just transferred
from Fort Wayne.

243
00:08:15,517 --> 00:08:17,718
I can't teach in
Indiana anymore

244
00:08:17,786 --> 00:08:20,020
'cause I have some
"drug problems"

245
00:08:20,088 --> 00:08:22,890
that ended up involving
some of my "shoot-ins."

246
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:26,293
{laughing}:
I saw your video.

247
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:30,431
And you, my friend,
are an embarrassment.

248
00:08:30,499 --> 00:08:33,701
And that's me talking!

249
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:36,237
{laughter echoes}

250
00:08:38,673 --> 00:08:41,108
{bell ringing}

251
00:08:41,176 --> 00:08:43,110
I need to enlist the
services of the A/V Club.

252
00:08:43,178 --> 00:08:44,645
What did you
have in mind?

253
00:08:44,713 --> 00:08:47,314
My shame at appearing so low on
the Glist has made me reevaluate

254
00:08:47,382 --> 00:08:49,416
my image at this school
and beyond.

255
00:08:49,484 --> 00:08:51,051
I've now realized
that in today's culture

256
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:53,454
of bad boy athletes
and celebrity sex tapes,

257
00:08:53,522 --> 00:08:55,956
a good reputation
is no good at all.

258
00:08:56,024 --> 00:08:58,058
Artie, you know how our
Glee Club assignment was

259
00:08:58,126 --> 00:09:00,694
to find a song with
a bad reputation
and rehabilitate it?

260
00:09:00,762 --> 00:09:02,296
Well, mine is going to afford me

261
00:09:02,364 --> 00:09:04,532
the worst reputation
in this school.

262
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:07,401
Rachel Berry is going to get
a little down and dirty.

263
00:09:07,469 --> 00:09:08,536
I'm going to stop you.

264
00:09:08,603 --> 00:09:09,737
You had me at "sex tape."

265
00:09:10,539 --> 00:09:11,472
How can I help?

266
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,474
Hold onto your hat,

267
00:09:13,542 --> 00:09:15,976
because Rachel Berry
is going to become

268
00:09:16,044 --> 00:09:18,940
{whispers}:
musically promiscuous.

269
00:09:26,084 --> 00:09:28,786
because our free-falling reps
have reached terminal velocity.

270
00:09:28,854 --> 00:09:30,188
We are at Defcon One.

271
00:09:30,255 --> 00:09:31,789
We're such zeros they
didn't even bother

272
00:09:31,857 --> 00:09:33,224
putting us on
the Glist.

273
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:35,826
What does a C-lister do
when their tiny star

274
00:09:35,894 --> 00:09:37,995
is about to fall off Perez
Hilton's radar screen?

275
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:40,965
They cause a
scandal so extreme

276
00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:42,733
they can no longer
be ignored.

277
00:09:42,801 --> 00:09:44,335
Um, excuse me.

278
00:09:44,403 --> 00:09:45,670
Why is she here?

279
00:09:47,606 --> 00:09:49,373
I've been here
since first period.

280
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:51,709
I had a cold, and I
took all my antibiotics

281
00:09:51,777 --> 00:09:55,680
at the same time, and now
I can't remember how to leave.

282
00:09:55,747 --> 00:09:57,915
But I also don't know why
I've only made fourth

283
00:09:57,983 --> 00:09:59,350
on the Glist.

284
00:09:59,418 --> 00:10:01,919
I've made out with, like,
everyone in this school.

285
00:10:01,987 --> 00:10:04,188
Girls, boys,
Mr. Kidney the janitor.

286
00:10:04,256 --> 00:10:05,823
I need to do

287
00:10:05,891 --> 00:10:07,525
something to get into
the top three.

288
00:10:07,593 --> 00:10:09,493
Fine, you're in.
In what?

289
00:10:09,561 --> 00:10:11,195
We don't even
have a plan.

290
00:10:11,263 --> 00:10:14,165
What is the worst thing
a student can do at this school?

291
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:15,433
Eat in the cafeteria?

292
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,567
{snickering}

293
00:10:16,635 --> 00:10:18,703
No, be a disruption
in the library.

294
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:19,971
And I'm not
talking about

295
00:10:20,038 --> 00:10:22,139
trying to check out
a reference book.

296
00:10:22,207 --> 00:10:23,541
Mm-mm.

297
00:10:23,609 --> 00:10:26,244
I'm talking about
full-on chaos--

298
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:28,212
including getting
your Glee on in the stacks.

299
00:10:29,414 --> 00:10:31,215
Genius.

300
00:10:31,283 --> 00:10:35,953
I never really understood
how hard it is to be laughed at.

301
00:10:36,021 --> 00:10:37,388
Particularly in slow motion.

302
00:10:37,456 --> 00:10:39,290
I try to make it seem

303
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:40,958
like nothing
can touch me, but...

304
00:10:41,026 --> 00:10:42,927
Boy...

305
00:10:42,995 --> 00:10:45,329
Jean, I'm so sorry you
ever felt that way.

306
00:10:45,397 --> 00:10:47,565
I'm sorry I didn't
protect you more.

307
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:49,600
Remember what we used
to do, Sue?

308
00:10:49,668 --> 00:10:51,669
Whenever I got sad,

309
00:10:51,737 --> 00:10:53,771
we'd help at the animal shelter,

310
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,740
to give back.

311
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:58,609
Because there's always someone
who's got it worse than you do.

312
00:11:02,648 --> 00:11:04,649
{bell ringing}
I'm a little confused.

313
00:11:04,716 --> 00:11:06,217
I understand.

314
00:11:06,285 --> 00:11:09,887
You're probably wondering, what
exactly does Sue Sylvester mean

315
00:11:09,955 --> 00:11:11,989
when she says,
"I'm your new therapist"?

316
00:11:12,057 --> 00:11:14,125
Well, let me explain.

317
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:16,961
As you may or may not know, I
star in a little music video

318
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:18,929
that's been circulating
around the Web.

319
00:11:18,997 --> 00:11:20,398
A video that has
a tendency to induce

320
00:11:20,465 --> 00:11:21,766
cruel, slow-motion laughter.

321
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,234
No, no, didn't-didn't
know about that.

322
00:11:23,302 --> 00:11:24,669
Well, this video

323
00:11:24,736 --> 00:11:27,672
has inspired Sue Sylvester
to start giving back.

324
00:11:27,739 --> 00:11:29,607
I happen to have my Masters
in counseling,

325
00:11:29,675 --> 00:11:31,976
and when I heard that
our school district's

326
00:11:32,044 --> 00:11:35,079
one and only psychologist
had committed suicide,

327
00:11:35,147 --> 00:11:38,015
well, I decided to volunteer
my services.

328
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,383
And they gave
me your name.

329
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:40,918
I'd really like to help.

330
00:11:40,986 --> 00:11:43,587
I don't know how I'm supposed
to feel about this.

331
00:11:43,655 --> 00:11:45,289
Ella, you're crippled
by mental illness.

332
00:11:45,357 --> 00:11:47,058
Your compulsions
have estranged you

333
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,793
from your own feelings.

334
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,929
You nearly married a gym teacher
who's more gravy than man.

335
00:11:51,997 --> 00:11:55,199
And you're content
to be repeatedly lied to

336
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:57,468
by the man
you purport to love.
I'm sorry?

337
00:11:57,536 --> 00:11:59,337
I bribed
Will Schuester's landlord

338
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:00,738
to slip baby monitors
under his couch,

339
00:12:00,806 --> 00:12:02,206
and under his bed.

340
00:12:02,274 --> 00:12:03,808
Turns out he's been having
make out sessions

341
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,644
with the coach from
Vocal Adrenaline,

342
00:12:06,712 --> 00:12:09,447
and sleepovers with that
world-class banana magnet

343
00:12:09,514 --> 00:12:10,681
April Rhodes.
Oh, my God.

344
00:12:10,749 --> 00:12:12,083
You need to make a bold move.

345
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,587
You suck.

346
00:12:16,655 --> 00:12:17,855
Excuse me?

347
00:12:17,923 --> 00:12:19,857
You take weird little strides
when you walk,

348
00:12:19,925 --> 00:12:21,692
as if you were raised
in imperial Japan

349
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,927
and someone bound your feet.

350
00:12:22,994 --> 00:12:24,929
You make a valid point.

351
00:12:24,996 --> 00:12:26,697
Grow a pair.
I'm insulting you.

352
00:12:26,765 --> 00:12:29,633
You refuse to stand up
for yourself,

353
00:12:29,701 --> 00:12:31,268
you're so afraid
of confrontation.

354
00:12:31,336 --> 00:12:32,436
You're right.

355
00:12:32,504 --> 00:12:33,738
If you want to get better,

356
00:12:33,805 --> 00:12:36,006
you need to start communicating
your feelings.

357
00:12:36,074 --> 00:12:39,176
You need to let
Will Schuester know
how he's made you feel,

358
00:12:39,244 --> 00:12:41,412
and in a public setting,
so he can'escape,

359
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,813
and he won't
manipulate you.

360
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:44,048
Trust me--

361
00:12:44,116 --> 00:12:46,584
you need to let him have it.

362
00:12:46,651 --> 00:12:49,587
<i>RACHEL:
Do you know that when we dated,
the rest of the school</i>

363
00:12:49,654 --> 00:12:50,855
gave us a nickname?

364
00:12:50,922 --> 00:12:52,523
Puckleberry.

365
00:12:52,591 --> 00:12:53,791
That's humiliating.

366
00:12:53,859 --> 00:12:56,861
The fact is that
slumming it with me

367
00:12:56,928 --> 00:12:58,362
actually improved
your reputation.

368
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:01,432
It gave you a sense of humanity.

369
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,467
Wait-- do you want
to date again?

370
00:13:03,535 --> 00:13:05,403
I was wondering why
you invited me here.

371
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,104
As you know, I'm taken.

372
00:13:07,172 --> 00:13:09,039
But I can be of
some assistance.

373
00:13:09,107 --> 00:13:11,308
Help me with my song for
Glee Club. I might be

374
00:13:11,376 --> 00:13:13,411
the last chance
you have to salvage

375
00:13:13,478 --> 00:13:15,713
what's left of
your reputation,
and stay in Glee.

376
00:13:15,781 --> 00:13:17,081
Besides, you need a song

377
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:19,016
that going to help you
express your inner pain.

378
00:13:19,084 --> 00:13:20,918
So what song do you want to do
for your assignment?

379
00:13:20,986 --> 00:13:23,754
I've chosen David Geddes'
fantastically terrible

380
00:13:23,822 --> 00:13:25,823
'70s top ten hit--
"Run Joey Run."

381
00:13:25,891 --> 00:13:27,958
It's a story song.

382
00:13:28,026 --> 00:13:29,427
So we get to play parts.

383
00:13:29,494 --> 00:13:31,395
I'm going to play the role
of the tragic heroine

384
00:13:31,463 --> 00:13:32,663
who dies in the end,

385
00:13:32,731 --> 00:13:34,131
<i>ÃÂ¡ la Nicole Kidman
in Moulin Rouge.</i>

386
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:36,000
And you can be the
hunky, heroic male lead.

387
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:37,334
Do I get to kill you?

388
00:13:37,402 --> 00:13:39,870
Actually, my dad shoots
me with a shotgun.

389
00:13:39,938 --> 00:13:41,739
{sighs}

390
00:13:41,807 --> 00:13:45,009
Do you think I made
that Glist? Honestly.

391
00:13:45,076 --> 00:13:47,578
Well, it does sound like
something that you would do.

392
00:13:47,646 --> 00:13:49,647
God, I'm so tired of people
judging me

393
00:13:49,714 --> 00:13:51,148
for a few mistakes I've made.

394
00:13:51,216 --> 00:13:52,917
I try to be
a good guy.

395
00:13:52,984 --> 00:13:56,253
I go to school and I say,
"Be cool, Puck. Be nice."

396
00:13:56,321 --> 00:13:58,689
But by second period, I've got
a fire extinguisher in my hands

397
00:13:58,757 --> 00:14:00,291
and I'm spraying
some dweeb with it

398
00:14:00,358 --> 00:14:02,493
and I don't know
how I got there.

399
00:14:02,561 --> 00:14:04,829
I understand. Yeah.

400
00:14:04,896 --> 00:14:08,199
I sit in Glee Club
and I watch

401
00:14:08,266 --> 00:14:10,501
a couple of imperfect
performances

402
00:14:10,569 --> 00:14:14,271
and a litany of criticisms
just start building up
inside of me like a volcano

403
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:16,207
and I keep telling myself
to hold it in

404
00:14:16,274 --> 00:14:17,975
and then it just
comes bursting out.

405
00:14:18,043 --> 00:14:20,277
Granted, generally
I'm right,

406
00:14:20,345 --> 00:14:22,613
but doesn't do much
for my reputation.

407
00:14:22,681 --> 00:14:24,415
It does suck when you do that.

408
00:14:29,454 --> 00:14:34,525
So, uh, how do you think
we can get people to
see us differently?

409
00:14:34,593 --> 00:14:37,161
I don't know.

410
00:14:39,865 --> 00:14:42,933
I can't-- I can't do this.

411
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:45,736
You know, whoever made
ÃÂ£ that Glist is going to
put you at number one

412
00:14:45,804 --> 00:14:49,173
when they find out you cheated
on that Jessie kid with me.

413
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:52,710
Besides, Jessie will never
fully understand what it
means to be a Jew.

414
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,648
Noah...

415
00:14:57,716 --> 00:14:59,984
I'm ironically turned on
by your bad boy image,

416
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:01,986
but I think we should
just keep this professional.

417
00:15:02,053 --> 00:15:03,821
All right, I'm out.

418
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:06,390
Why should I stay if there's
no chance of us making out?

419
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:10,861
Noah, please come and sit down
and let's work on the project.

420
00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:12,897
Okay, it'll help us both.

421
00:15:12,964 --> 00:15:14,899
I promise.

422
00:15:18,263 --> 00:15:19,763
- {bell rings}
- I don't think I can do this.

423
00:15:19,831 --> 00:15:21,131
Are you sure this
is a good idea?

424
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,800
Stop thinking about him
and do it for yourself.

425
00:15:22,867 --> 00:15:26,003
Okay, let's do this.

426
00:15:26,071 --> 00:15:27,938
Nah, can't go in
the teacher's lounge.

427
00:15:28,006 --> 00:15:30,341
Lots of cruel, slow-motion
laughter going on in there.

428
00:15:30,408 --> 00:15:32,643
Well, look who it is.

429
00:15:32,711 --> 00:15:34,645
I thought I smelled
a laughingstock.

430
00:15:34,713 --> 00:15:37,381
Don't start with me
Castle, or I will kick
you square in the taco.

431
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:38,949
It's a date.

432
00:15:39,017 --> 00:15:42,353
That's just a typical
Saturday night in
the Castle condo.

433
00:15:47,592 --> 00:15:49,860
I think it's mornings...
Yeah.

434
00:15:49,928 --> 00:15:50,928
Go get 'em.

435
00:15:50,996 --> 00:15:53,797
Some days you...

436
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,500
That's okay.

437
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,037
Excuse me.

438
00:16:02,107 --> 00:16:04,174
Oh, hey, Em, can you
just give us a sec?

439
00:16:04,242 --> 00:16:05,376
Actually no.

440
00:16:05,443 --> 00:16:07,745
Will, I can't give you a sec.

441
00:16:07,812 --> 00:16:09,279
You're just going
to have to reschedul

442
00:16:09,347 --> 00:16:10,881
your heavy petting session with
Mrs. Carlisle for a later time.

443
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:12,116
Emma!

444
00:16:12,183 --> 00:16:14,551
I beg your pardon?

445
00:16:14,619 --> 00:16:16,020
I was just telling
Mr. Schuester

446
00:16:16,087 --> 00:16:19,456
about how my husband
recently died.

447
00:16:19,524 --> 00:16:21,025
Wow.

448
00:16:21,092 --> 00:16:23,861
Getting them fresh off the
rebound now, aren't you?

449
00:16:23,928 --> 00:16:26,930
Amazing. Nobody's safe.
Nobody is safe.

450
00:16:26,998 --> 00:16:29,233
Emma, can I talk
to you in private?
No, you can't.

451
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,335
Will, we're going to talk
about this here and now,

452
00:16:31,403 --> 00:16:32,770
because I have absolutely
nothing to hide.

453
00:16:32,837 --> 00:16:35,272
Actually, did you know
I was seeing a therapist?

454
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,141
Do you know that? Did you
know I've been trying

455
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,909
to work through my OCD
so I could be with you?

456
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:40,844
Will, do you think
that's fun for me?

457
00:16:40,912 --> 00:16:42,413
It's not fun; it's
absolutely humiliating.

458
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,649
And come to find out
you've been fooling around

459
00:16:45,717 --> 00:16:46,683
with some woman
named Shelby,

460
00:16:46,751 --> 00:16:47,918
and you slept
with April Rhodes.

461
00:16:47,986 --> 00:16:50,254
How did you find out
about that?

462
00:16:50,321 --> 00:16:51,555
You're not denying it.

463
00:16:51,623 --> 00:16:52,956
Wow, okay.

464
00:16:53,024 --> 00:16:54,625
See, I thought we were trying
to work through this.

465
00:16:54,692 --> 00:16:56,593
I thought when you said you
were trying to figure out things

466
00:16:56,661 --> 00:16:58,929
on your own, I thought
you meant that.

467
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:01,131
I'm not going to stand
for this anymore.

468
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,633
I'm not. I'm putting
my foot down,

469
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,701
and I am finally
sticking up for myself.

470
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,137
You're a slut, Will.

471
00:17:08,173 --> 00:17:09,440
You're a slut.

472
00:17:09,507 --> 00:17:11,708
You're a slut, you're a slut,
you're a slut.

473
00:17:11,776 --> 00:17:13,444
Everybody should know that.

474
00:17:13,511 --> 00:17:15,779
And you should know that
I'm through with you.

475
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,350
I'm very sorry for your loss.

476
00:17:25,623 --> 00:17:27,524
{bell ringing}

477
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:39,336
Looks like we got
a full house, y'all.

478
00:17:39,404 --> 00:17:41,071
I'm kind of getting
cold feet here.

479
00:17:41,139 --> 00:17:42,206
Can you even
feel your feet?

480
00:17:42,273 --> 00:17:43,107
Shh!

481
00:17:44,476 --> 00:17:45,809
Team, listen up.

482
00:17:45,877 --> 00:17:48,212
If we pull this off, we will be
legends at this school.

483
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:49,680
We'll rocket
up the Glist.

484
00:17:49,747 --> 00:17:51,081
We will be top-five, easy.

485
00:17:51,149 --> 00:17:52,649
Artie, pump up the jam.

486
00:17:52,717 --> 00:17:54,651
It's about to go down.

487
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:00,824
You can't touch this.

488
00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:06,063
¶¶ My, my, my music hits me
so hard ¶¶
¶¶ Can't touch this ¶¶

489
00:18:06,131 --> 00:18:07,698
¶¶ Makes me say, oh, my Lord ¶¶

490
00:18:07,765 --> 00:18:09,133
¶¶ Thank you for blessing me ¶¶

491
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,502
¶¶ With a mind to rhyme
and two hype feet ¶¶

492
00:18:11,569 --> 00:18:13,270
¶¶ It feels good,
when you know you're down ¶¶

493
00:18:13,338 --> 00:18:14,938
¶¶ A super dope homeboy
from the Oaktown ¶¶

494
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:16,640
¶¶ And I'm known as such ¶¶

495
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:19,076
¶¶ And this is a beat,
uh, you can't touch ¶¶

496
00:18:19,144 --> 00:18:21,111
¶¶ I told you, homeboy ¶¶

497
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:23,147
¶¶ Can't touch this ¶¶

498
00:18:23,214 --> 00:18:25,983
¶¶ Yo, let me bust
this funky lyric ¶¶
¶¶ Can't touch this ¶¶

499
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,018
¶¶ Fresh new kicks advance,
you gotta like that ¶¶

500
00:18:28,086 --> 00:18:29,720
¶¶ Now you know you wanna dance ¶¶

501
00:18:29,787 --> 00:18:31,255
¶¶ So move, outta your seat ¶¶

502
00:18:31,322 --> 00:18:33,323
¶¶ And get a fly girl
and catch this beat ¶¶

503
00:18:33,391 --> 00:18:35,025
¶¶ While it's rolling,
hold on ¶¶

504
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:37,494
¶¶ Pump a little bit and let
'em know it's going on ¶¶

505
00:18:37,562 --> 00:18:38,829
¶¶ Like that, like that ¶¶

506
00:18:38,897 --> 00:18:40,531
¶¶ Cold on a mission
so fall them back ¶¶

507
00:18:40,598 --> 00:18:42,266
¶¶ Let 'em know
that you're too much ¶¶

508
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,234
¶¶ And this is a beat, uh,
you can't touch ¶¶

509
00:18:44,302 --> 00:18:46,570
<i>¶¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh ¶¶</i>

510
00:18:46,638 --> 00:18:50,340

can't touch this ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh ¶¶</i>

00:18:56,414 --> 00:19:00,918

¶¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh ¶¶</i>

514
00:19:00,985 --> 00:19:04,221
<i>¶¶ Too high,
you can't touch this ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, oh, oh ¶¶</i>

515
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:07,024
¶¶ Yo, we out of here,
can't touch this. ¶¶

516
00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:08,325
{gasping}

517
00:19:10,595 --> 00:19:11,595
Here it comes.

518
00:19:14,933 --> 00:19:16,333
That was very cute.

519
00:19:16,401 --> 00:19:17,801
I'm gonna talk to my pastor

520
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:21,838
and see if I can't get
you kids to perform that

521
00:19:21,906 --> 00:19:23,941
for our Sunday service.

522
00:19:28,694 --> 00:19:30,828
, I don't like doing this
any more than you do,

523
00:19:30,896 --> 00:19:32,463
but if I don't find out
who made that Glist

524
00:19:32,531 --> 00:19:33,631
and stop another one
from being published,

525
00:19:33,699 --> 00:19:34,665
the whole Glee Club's
going down.

526
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:36,167
And I can't
let that happen.

527
00:19:36,235 --> 00:19:38,403
Look, I know I've been
kind of angry lately,

528
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,872
and sometimes I kick over
chairs and stuff,
but I didn't do it.

529
00:19:40,939 --> 00:19:43,307
All the pieces fit, Finn.
You have a very big axe to grind

530
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,809
with several people
on that Glist.

531
00:19:44,877 --> 00:19:47,512
Quinn broke your heart, Puck
betrayed your friendship,

532
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:49,247
you're dealing with Kurt's
dad dating your mom,

533
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:50,915
and I happen to know you've
had your ups and downs

534
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:52,316
with Santana and Brittany...

535
00:19:52,384 --> 00:19:54,185
I have nothing against Santana,
and I like Brittany.

536
00:19:54,253 --> 00:19:55,953
Quinn's the one who has
a beef with them.

537
00:19:56,021 --> 00:19:58,556
Well, there are an awful lot
of Cheerios! on that Glist.

538
00:19:58,624 --> 00:19:59,624
Isn't it true
that you still feel like

539
00:19:59,691 --> 00:20:00,992
an outcast in that group?

540
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,893
I don't know what
you're talking about.

541
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,494
I like being a Cheerio.

542
00:20:03,562 --> 00:20:05,797
And why does everyone just
assume I'm angry all the time?

543
00:20:05,864 --> 00:20:08,366
It's called being sassy,
Mr. Shue.

544
00:20:08,434 --> 00:20:10,168
It's simple math,
Mr. Shue.

545
00:20:10,235 --> 00:20:12,203
The Glists are posted at a
height of five and a half feet,

546
00:20:12,271 --> 00:20:13,938
comfortably out of my reach.
It could not have been me.

547
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:15,573
And I have it on
good word that...

548
00:20:15,641 --> 00:20:18,076
I saw Puckutting up the Glist
in the hallway.
I was moving it!

549
00:20:18,143 --> 00:20:20,244
Somebody put it up on
Rachel's locker, so I moved it.

550
00:20:20,312 --> 00:20:22,113
I was being a man,
doing the right thing.

551
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:24,148
Puck, at some point,
the lies are going to stop,

552
00:20:24,216 --> 00:20:25,550
and you're going to start
to sing.

553
00:20:25,617 --> 00:20:27,185
If I did it, why would
I put myself at number three?

554
00:20:27,252 --> 00:20:29,087
As far as bad-asses go,
I'm number wha.

555
00:20:29,154 --> 00:20:30,788
I'll say it again,
I didn't do it!

556
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:32,623
I don't know
how to turn on a computer.

557
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:33,724
Rachel did it.

558
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:35,126
Think about it:
I stole the guy

559
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:37,295
she's in love with,
then I stole the guy she dated

560
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:38,896
to get over the guy
she's in love with.

561
00:20:38,964 --> 00:20:41,365
And I'm kind of a bitch to her.
Just doesn't seem like Rachel.

562
00:20:41,433 --> 00:20:43,634
She's gone behind
your back before.

563
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:46,370
And I mean, who's to say that
there's only one culprit?

564
00:20:46,438 --> 00:20:48,072
Look, I know you know something!

565
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,108
So we're not leaving here
until I get some answers.

566
00:20:50,175 --> 00:20:53,010
Mr. Schuester, may I be blunt?

567
00:20:53,078 --> 00:20:55,613
{sighs}

568
00:20:55,681 --> 00:20:57,715
Shoot.

569
00:20:57,783 --> 00:20:59,650
Ever since you separated
from your wife,

570
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,319
you've spent a lot
of late nights

571
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:03,988
<i>watching reruns of
Law and Order, haven't you?</i>

572
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:07,091
Hmm. Thought so.

573
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:09,060
And no, I didn't make the Glist.

574
00:21:09,128 --> 00:21:10,561
{sighs}

575
00:21:10,629 --> 00:21:11,996
Right.

576
00:21:14,199 --> 00:21:16,234
{bell ringing}

577
00:21:16,301 --> 00:21:17,735
We're as menacing
as Muppet Babies.

578
00:21:17,803 --> 00:21:19,470
Which means our
squeaky-clean reputations

579
00:21:19,538 --> 00:21:21,506
are still very much intact.

580
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:23,241
We have to do
what we've been dreading,

581
00:21:23,308 --> 00:21:25,543
something more terrifying
than Rachel's personality--

582
00:21:27,112 --> 00:21:28,546
We have to go to Sylvester

583
00:21:28,614 --> 00:21:29,747
<i>and admit that we
posted the Physical video.</i>

584
00:21:29,815 --> 00:21:31,482
But we'll get suspended.

585
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,917
And it will be worth it.

586
00:21:32,985 --> 00:21:34,051
Finally the entire
student body

587
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:36,454
will see us as bad-asses.

588
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:44,228
<i>Dear Journal, I don't know
how much longer</i>

589
00:21:44,296 --> 00:21:46,631
<i>I can take the humiliation.</i>

590
00:21:46,698 --> 00:21:49,967
<i>The video has just surpassed
three million hits.</i>

591
00:21:50,035 --> 00:21:53,104
<i>Is my misery some kind
of karmic retribution</i>

592
00:21:53,172 --> 00:21:54,772
<i>for the way
I've treated people?</i>

593
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,806
{phone ringing}

594
00:22:00,946 --> 00:22:02,313
You're go for Sue.

595
00:22:02,381 --> 00:22:04,115
Hello? Sue?

596
00:22:04,183 --> 00:22:06,784
<i>It's Olivia Newton-John,
star of Grease--</i>

597
00:22:06,852 --> 00:22:09,187
the most successful movie
musical of all time.

598
00:22:09,254 --> 00:22:12,823
Nice try.
And that's a ridiculous accent.

599
00:22:12,891 --> 00:22:14,392
Uh...

600
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:17,562
<i>Journal, I've learned
my lesson.</i>

601
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:21,566
<i>Sue Sylvester's gotta start
playing nice full-time.</i>

602
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:23,034
{phone rings}

603
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:32,476
Hi! Uh, we must have
been cut off.

604
00:22:32,544 --> 00:22:33,978
It's Olivia Newton-John.

605
00:22:34,046 --> 00:22:35,947
I released a record
seven-consecutive

606
00:22:36,014 --> 00:22:36,981
number one singles.

607
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:38,516
Sing something.

608
00:22:38,584 --> 00:22:40,985
¶¶ Let's get physical ¶¶

609
00:22:41,053 --> 00:22:42,253
¶¶ Physical... ¶¶

610
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:44,755
That song was the best-selling

611
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:46,190
record of the '80s.

612
00:22:46,258 --> 00:22:48,326
Listen, Sue, I'm headed
for a ribbon-cutting ceremony

613
00:22:48,393 --> 00:22:51,195
at a sanctuary
for orphaned koalas,

614
00:22:51,263 --> 00:22:53,564
but I heard my daughter Chloe
laughing at something

615
00:22:53,632 --> 00:22:55,166
on the Internet the other day,

616
00:22:55,234 --> 00:22:57,068
and I saw your video.

617
00:22:57,135 --> 00:22:59,136
And I just have to ask,

618
00:22:59,204 --> 00:23:00,838
whatever would possess a person

619
00:23:00,906 --> 00:23:02,073
to do something like that?

620
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,908
Well, I gotta tell you, Olivia,

621
00:23:03,976 --> 00:23:06,644
that video was never meant
for public consumption.

622
00:23:06,712 --> 00:23:08,779
Some people enjoy videotaping
themselves

623
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:10,581
being intimate with a partner.

624
00:23:10,649 --> 00:23:12,850
I happen to enjoy revisiting
the impeccable form

625
00:23:12,918 --> 00:23:15,152
of my various jazzercise
routines.

626
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,754
Well, it got me thinking.

627
00:23:16,822 --> 00:23:19,056
You know, that song was
the biggest hit of my career.

628
00:23:19,124 --> 00:23:21,192
"Physical" spent ten weeks
at number one.

629
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,360
It's a classic.

630
00:23:22,427 --> 00:23:23,694
I agree.

631
00:23:23,762 --> 00:23:26,530
Unfortunately, I botched
the video, which,

632
00:23:26,598 --> 00:23:29,433
by the way, was one of the first
music videos ever.

633
00:23:29,501 --> 00:23:31,902
But I filled it with obese guys
in spandex,

634
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,739
and it went over the top,
and the song went with it.

635
00:23:34,806 --> 00:23:36,907
But I saw
your YouTube video, Sue,

636
00:23:36,975 --> 00:23:38,676
and I realized that now
is the time

637
00:23:38,744 --> 00:23:40,278
to save it--
and possibly you.

638
00:23:40,345 --> 00:23:42,613
I'll be in Ohio tomorrow
chairing

639
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:44,682
a benefit for Save the
Rainforests at King's Island.

640
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,852
I don't understand.

641
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,253
{bell ringing}

642
00:23:53,859 --> 00:23:55,826
Hey, man-whore.

643
00:23:57,329 --> 00:23:58,562
Will Schuester?
Yeah.

644
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,464
I'm Brenda Castle.

645
00:24:00,532 --> 00:24:02,800
I'm the new astronomy teacher
and badminton coach.

646
00:24:02,868 --> 00:24:04,669
I also happen
to be an alcoholic,

647
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:07,004
and... I like pills.

648
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:08,739
I hear that's
just your type.

649
00:24:08,807 --> 00:24:10,441
Let's go in this classroom
and pork!

650
00:24:10,509 --> 00:24:11,709
No.

651
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:15,613
I am praying
for you, William.

652
00:24:15,681 --> 00:24:18,215
We've all heard
about your gallivanting!

653
00:24:18,283 --> 00:24:20,318
But nothing happened!

654
00:24:20,385 --> 00:24:22,086
Maybe that's not
what matters, Will.

655
00:24:22,154 --> 00:24:23,921
You broke the heart
of somebody

656
00:24:23,989 --> 00:24:25,589
who doesn't let people
get close to her.

657
00:24:25,657 --> 00:24:26,924
I didn't mean
to hurt anybody.

658
00:24:26,992 --> 00:24:28,693
You probably didn't mean
to hurt me, either,

659
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,062
but lately I've been feeding
my feelings to the tune

660
00:24:31,129 --> 00:24:32,263
of 6,000 calories a day.

661
00:24:32,331 --> 00:24:34,432
{sighs}

662
00:24:34,499 --> 00:24:35,533
Slut.

663
00:24:43,132 --> 00:24:44,799
Remember-- if Sylvester
hits you in the fbce

664
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:46,334
after you cop
to posting the video,

665
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:47,702
don't scream like a woman.

666
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,470
You're so brave
for doing this, Kurt.

667
00:24:49,538 --> 00:24:51,673
I know. Thank you.

668
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,374
Oh, my God...

669
00:25:00,683 --> 00:25:03,718
Coach Sylvester, can I have just
a minute of your time?

670
00:25:03,786 --> 00:25:05,119
What do you want, ladyface?

671
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,922
You're aware a tape was leaked

672
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,657
onto the Internet,
causing you to become

673
00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:11,159
a national laughingstock?

674
00:25:11,226 --> 00:25:13,161
We stole the tape from your
syringe-and-pill drawer.

675
00:25:13,228 --> 00:25:14,629
We posted it online.

676
00:25:14,697 --> 00:25:16,497
We'll accept whatever punishment
you see fit.

677
00:25:16,565 --> 00:25:18,266
So it was you.

678
00:25:19,535 --> 00:25:21,903
I can't thank you enough.

679
00:25:27,209 --> 00:25:28,743
<i>ARTIE:
She wasn't angry at all.</i>

680
00:25:28,811 --> 00:25:30,311
It was weird.

681
00:25:30,379 --> 00:25:31,612
Maybe the comments
online have gotten

682
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,015
so mean, people have started
to feel sorry for her.

683
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:35,249
She's finally getting
some sympathy,

684
00:25:35,317 --> 00:25:37,318
so she's in a
forgiving mood.

685
00:25:37,386 --> 00:25:38,553
Wait a second.

686
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,154
Take a look at this.

All right, guys, listen up.

Another week has almost passed.

737
00:28:11,707 --> 00:28:13,207
If a list goes up again
later today,

738
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:14,809
this issue is out of my hands,

739
00:28:14,877 --> 00:28:18,379
and it becomes Principal
Figgins' jurisdiction.

740
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:20,014
Seriously, Mr. Shue,
whoever made that list

741
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:21,249
is not gonna come
forward.

742
00:28:21,316 --> 00:28:22,850
We might as well just bend over

743
00:28:22,918 --> 00:28:23,784
and take whatever's coming.

744
00:28:27,823 --> 00:28:30,024
Fine.

745
00:28:30,092 --> 00:28:31,125
Okay.

746
00:28:31,193 --> 00:28:32,693
Well, then, uh,
let's get to it.

747
00:28:32,761 --> 00:28:35,630
Rachel, how about you show us
your bad reputation project?

748
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:38,966
I'd like to say
a few words first.

749
00:28:39,034 --> 00:28:40,835
Though I understand
that a motion picture

750
00:28:40,903 --> 00:28:42,270
should stand on its own,

751
00:28:42,337 --> 00:28:44,138
I do realize that some of you
are not well-versed

752
00:28:44,206 --> 00:28:46,040
in the complex vocabulary
of the filmic arts.

753
00:28:46,108 --> 00:28:48,943
I expect that this video will go
over some of the heads

754
00:28:49,011 --> 00:28:50,778
of our less-cultured teammates.

755
00:28:50,846 --> 00:28:53,581
So let me just say
I hope you enjoy

756
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:54,949
my "Bad Reputation."

757
00:28:55,017 --> 00:28:56,817

¶¶ I can't erase the memory ¶¶

00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:39,327
¶¶ The sound of Julie's cry ¶¶

769
00:29:39,394 --> 00:29:42,196
¶¶ She called me up
late that night ¶¶

770
00:29:42,264 --> 00:29:45,099
¶¶ And she said,
"Joe, don't come over ¶¶

771
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:47,768
¶¶ "My dad and I just had
a fight ¶¶

772

¶¶ "And he stormed out
the door! ¶¶

00:29:51,073 --> 00:29:54,542
¶¶ "I've never seen him act
this way ¶¶

774
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:57,845
¶¶ "My God, he's going crazy! ¶¶

775
00:29:57,913 --> 00:29:59,914
¶¶ "He said
he's gonna make you pay ¶¶

776
00:29:59,982 --> 00:30:02,817
¶¶ "For what we've done ¶¶

777
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:06,654
¶¶ He's got a gun,
so run, Joey!" ¶¶

778
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:09,557
¶¶ Joey, run! ¶¶

779
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:12,526
¶¶ Daddy, please don't ¶¶

780
00:30:12,594 --> 00:30:16,731
¶¶ It wasn't his fault,
he means so much to me ¶¶

781
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:18,499
¶¶ Daddy, please don't ¶¶

JESSIE:
¶¶ Got in my car and drove
like mad ¶¶

785
00:30:27,976 --> 00:30:30,511
¶¶ Till I reached Julie's place ¶¶

786
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:34,548
¶¶ She ran to me,
with tear-filled eyes ¶¶

787
00:30:34,616 --> 00:30:37,418
¶¶ And bruises on her face ¶¶

788
00:30:37,486 --> 00:30:41,022
¶¶ All at once, I saw him there ¶¶

789
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,324
¶¶ Sneaking up behind me ¶¶

790
00:30:43,392 --> 00:30:44,759
¶¶ Watch out! ¶¶

791
00:30:44,826 --> 00:30:47,295
¶¶ Then Julie yelled,
"He's got a gun!" ¶¶

792
00:30:47,362 --> 00:30:49,964
¶¶ And she stepped
in front of me ¶¶

793
00:30:50,032 --> 00:30:54,268
¶¶ Then, suddenly,
a shot rang out ¶¶

794
00:30:54,336 --> 00:30:57,004
¶¶ And I saw Julie falling ¶¶

795
00:30:57,072 --> 00:31:00,841
¶¶ I ran to her,
I held her close ¶¶

796
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:03,911
¶¶ When I looked down,
my hands were red ¶¶

797
00:31:03,979 --> 00:31:06,647
¶¶ And here's the last words ¶¶

798
00:31:06,715 --> 00:31:09,016
¶¶ Julie said... ¶¶

799
00:31:09,084 --> 00:31:13,587
¶¶ Daddy, please don't,
it wasn't his fault ¶¶

800
00:31:13,655 --> 00:31:15,990
¶¶ He means so much to me ¶¶

801
00:31:16,058 --> 00:31:18,793
¶¶ Daddy, please don't ¶¶

802
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,562
¶¶ We're gonna get married... ¶¶

803
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:26,434
{angelic chorus vocalizing}

804
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,310
¶¶ Run, Joey, run, Joey, run ¶¶

805
00:31:36,378 --> 00:31:39,747
¶¶ Joey, run, Joey, run ¶¶

806
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:47,455
¶¶ Joey, run, Joey, run! ¶¶

807
00:31:47,522 --> 00:31:49,056
{song ends}

808
00:32:00,702 --> 00:32:03,437
Well, why don't we just, um,
take a moment

809
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,606
to really absorb
what we've just watched.

810
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:06,974
This is garbage!
Finn!

811
00:32:07,042 --> 00:32:09,176
No, he's right.
First of all, I need to trust

812
00:32:09,244 --> 00:32:10,711
my instincts more
because I had a feeling

813
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:12,279
when we were shooting that, that
it was not going to be good.

814
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,315
Why didn't you tell me
they were in this, too?

815
00:32:14,383 --> 00:32:15,850
I thought you
and I were going out.

816
00:32:15,917 --> 00:32:17,017
Being triple-cast
with two other guys

817
00:32:17,085 --> 00:32:18,786
to play opposite
your girlfriend?

818
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:19,887
It's mortifying.

819
00:32:19,955 --> 00:32:21,489
It was an artistic statement.

820
00:32:21,556 --> 00:32:22,923
FINN:
No. it wasn't!
It was you

821
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:24,125
trying to look like

822
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,826
you had a bunch of guys fighting
over you

823
00:32:25,894 --> 00:32:27,328
so you could stop looking like
some kind

824
00:32:27,396 --> 00:32:28,696
of outcast and be seen

825
00:32:28,764 --> 00:32:31,265
as some hot slutty girl singer!

826
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:33,667
How could you do this to me;

827
00:32:33,735 --> 00:32:35,169
to all us guys?

828
00:32:35,237 --> 00:32:36,504
Is your stupid reputation
more important

829
00:32:36,571 --> 00:32:37,505
than your relationships?

830
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,143
Jessie, wait!

831
00:32:52,328 --> 00:32:54,296
JEAN:
I saw your video, Sue!
You were fabulous!

832
00:32:54,364 --> 00:32:55,264
You know, I have

833
00:32:55,331 --> 00:32:56,532
to thank you, Jean.

834
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,467
You always know exactly
what to say to me

835
00:32:58,535 --> 00:32:59,902
when I lose my way.

836
00:32:59,969 --> 00:33:02,571
Turns out all I needed
was an attitude change.

837
00:33:02,639 --> 00:33:05,240
I forgot how good
it feels to give back.

838
00:33:05,308 --> 00:33:07,142
I've spent
so much time worrying

839
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,877
about what other people
thought about me,

840
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,846
when there's really
only one person in the world

841
00:33:10,914 --> 00:33:12,014
I want to impress.

842
00:33:12,081 --> 00:33:13,048
Who?

843
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,816
Who? You, silly.

844
00:33:14,884 --> 00:33:16,185
So, yesterday,
I walked

845
00:33:16,252 --> 00:33:18,420
back into that teachers' lounge,

846
00:33:18,488 --> 00:33:22,024
and I calmly informed them
of my unlikely skyrocket

847
00:33:22,091 --> 00:33:24,059
to showbiz fame,
and very gently

848
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:28,030
told them all I just didn't care
what they thought about me.

849
00:33:28,097 --> 00:33:30,299
What's that? Oh, look.

850
00:33:30,366 --> 00:33:33,402
Sue Sylvester is a top 700
recording artist, people!

851
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,637
Who's laughing now, huh?

852
00:33:35,705 --> 00:33:37,272
Now, since Olivia is giving

853
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,042
her cut of the proceeds
to injured manatees,

854
00:33:40,109 --> 00:33:41,543
I've decided to give

855
00:33:41,611 --> 00:33:43,779
all of my profits
to this nursing home.

856
00:33:43,846 --> 00:33:45,414
It's not going to be much.

857
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:47,182
Olivia totally screwed me
in negotiations.

858
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,450
I won't be working

859
00:33:48,518 --> 00:33:50,185
with her again, but
it should be enough

860
00:33:50,253 --> 00:33:52,487
for a couple of benches out back
for the summer.

861
00:33:52,555 --> 00:33:54,957
Maybe a little vegetable garden
for you to putter ound in.

862
00:33:55,024 --> 00:33:56,792
That'd be nice.

863
00:33:56,859 --> 00:33:58,327
Yeah.

864
00:33:58,394 --> 00:34:00,329
Now, after all these years,
how is it

865
00:34:00,396 --> 00:34:03,031
that you still know so much more
about everything than I do?

866
00:34:03,099 --> 00:34:04,399
I'm the smart one.

867
00:34:04,467 --> 00:34:05,534
{chuckles}

868
00:34:05,602 --> 00:34:06,668
You got the looks, too.

869
00:34:06,736 --> 00:34:07,803
How is that fair?

870
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,271
Ah, thank you.

871
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:11,673
{laughs} Let's say we
crack open a book, huh?

872
00:34:11,741 --> 00:34:13,141
Okay.

873
00:34:13,209 --> 00:34:14,376
See that-- the
two little bears?

874
00:34:14,444 --> 00:34:15,744
That's you and I.
That's right.

875
00:34:15,812 --> 00:34:17,746
I'm the big one, right?
And I'm the small one.

876
00:34:17,814 --> 00:34:18,780
Yeah, you're the tiny one.

877
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:19,915
And what does that say?

878
00:34:19,983 --> 00:34:21,450
"I always love you."

879
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:23,885
"And I will always
love you."

880
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,889
{bell ringing}

881
00:34:32,228 --> 00:34:33,595
{knocks gently}
Hey.

882
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,066
Uh, these are for you.

883
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,238
They're lovely.

884
00:34:43,306 --> 00:34:44,473
Thank you.

885
00:34:46,809 --> 00:34:47,943
{clears throat}

886
00:34:48,011 --> 00:34:51,580
Um... I-I messed up, Emma.

887
00:34:51,648 --> 00:34:53,315
I think,
in all of this

888
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:55,851
{inhales deeply}
"discovering who I am" business,

889
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,420
I took a couple of wrong turns.

890
00:34:58,488 --> 00:35:00,822
And I get how those detours

891
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,125
might have hurt you.

892
00:35:03,192 --> 00:35:06,662
But now I know
that that's not who I am

893
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:09,064
or who I want to be.

894
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,567
I know what's supposed
to happen now.

895
00:35:12,635 --> 00:35:14,202
I'm supposed to smile

896
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:16,638
and be impressed by how in touch
you are with your feelings

897
00:35:16,706 --> 00:35:19,074
and moon over the fact
that you care about me so much,

898
00:35:19,142 --> 00:35:22,511
but, um...

899
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,146
I can't.

900
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:28,383
But, Emily, th-this is...
this is killing me.

901
00:35:28,451 --> 00:35:29,918
I just...

902
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:32,688
{sighs}

903
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,923
I want you to look at me
the way you used to.

904
00:35:38,027 --> 00:35:39,928
I can't.
{clears throat}

905
00:35:42,165 --> 00:35:43,899
But you know what,
that's a good thing.

906
00:35:43,966 --> 00:35:45,801
Really, if this relationship
is ever going to work

907
00:35:45,868 --> 00:35:47,703
between the two of us,
we have to start

908
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,705
seeing each other
for who we really are.

909
00:35:53,309 --> 00:35:55,010
Thank you for the flowers.

910
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:20,068
I know you're behind the Glist.

911
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,903
You have no proof.
I can't believe

912
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,272
that you're going to pin this
on me. I'll be expelled.

913
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,907
I mean, it makes sense.

914
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,709
Everything else
has been taken from me--

915
00:36:27,777 --> 00:36:30,245
my popularity, my body.

916
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,647
Might as well throw away
my education.

917
00:36:32,715 --> 00:36:34,082
You know when I realized
that you did it?

918
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:36,918
The moment I felt
what it was like

919
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,453
to walk in your shoes.

920
00:36:38,521 --> 00:36:40,822
I mean, it takes years
to build a good reputation,

921
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,257
but only seconds to destroy it.

922
00:36:43,693 --> 00:36:45,994
Couple bad choices,
and you go from the top

923
00:36:46,062 --> 00:36:47,229
to the bottom.

924
00:36:51,367 --> 00:36:53,835
You have lost so much, Quinn.

925
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,706
Which means you had the most
to gain from the Glist.

926
00:37:00,576 --> 00:37:02,611
I never meant to hurt anybody.

927
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,215
I... I was captain
of the cheerleading squad,

928
00:37:07,283 --> 00:37:09,217
president of the Celibacy Club.

929
00:37:09,285 --> 00:37:10,819
I had Finn.

930
00:37:10,887 --> 00:37:14,022
People would part
like the Red Sea when I walked

931
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:15,557
down the hallway.

932
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:17,125
Now I'm invisible.

933
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,861
And you think being seen
as a cheap tramp is better?

934
00:37:19,929 --> 00:37:22,898
A bad reputation is better
than no reputation at all.

935
00:37:24,167 --> 00:37:25,534
Look, I know
that high school feels

936
00:37:25,601 --> 00:37:26,902
like your whole life right now,

937
00:37:26,969 --> 00:37:28,303
but it's going to end.

938
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,505
You're going to give
that baby to a family

939
00:37:30,573 --> 00:37:32,741
who really wants it,
who's going to love it,

940
00:37:32,809 --> 00:37:35,911
and then you are going to go on
to do amazing things, Quinn.

941
00:37:37,413 --> 00:37:40,148
You really think that I
can get it all back one day?

942
00:37:41,818 --> 00:37:43,351
{sighs}

943
00:37:45,588 --> 00:37:46,788
No.

944
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:51,226
I think you can get
something even better.

945
00:37:51,294 --> 00:37:53,261
I mean, come on.
You're Quinn Fabray, right?

946
00:37:53,329 --> 00:37:54,362
I mean, those
people didn't part

947
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:55,697
when you walked down the halls;

948
00:37:55,765 --> 00:37:57,499
you moved them
with your attitude.

949
00:37:59,035 --> 00:38:00,202
Thanks, Mr. Shue.

950
00:38:01,671 --> 00:38:02,971
You're a really good teacher--

951
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:05,507
even if everybody
is calling you a man-whore.

952
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:07,375
FIGGINS:
You wanted to see me,
William?

953
00:38:07,443 --> 00:38:08,610
I trust you
have come up

954
00:38:08,678 --> 00:38:11,313
with the perpetrators
of the Glist.

955
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,681
I, um... I grilled

956
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,583
every single one
of my students,

957
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:18,119
and, uh... no one.

958
00:38:18,187 --> 00:38:19,721
No one copped
to making the Glist.

959
00:38:19,789 --> 00:38:22,791
They all closed ranks
and wouldn't rat out who did it.

960
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:24,493
That's poppycock, Will.

961
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,128
I will not let this school
be held hostage

962
00:38:27,196 --> 00:38:28,630
by juvenile shenanigans.

963
00:38:28,698 --> 00:38:31,466
I know, but... I mean,
your point has been made.

964
00:38:31,534 --> 00:38:32,968
The Glists have stopped.

965
00:38:33,035 --> 00:38:34,569
I think we should just

966
00:38:34,637 --> 00:38:36,004
call this a victory
and move on.

967
00:38:40,843 --> 00:38:42,511
Fine.

968
00:38:42,578 --> 00:38:44,713
I'm still praying for you, Will.

969
00:38:51,988 --> 00:38:53,421
Thank you.

970
00:38:53,489 --> 00:38:55,357
{bell ringing}

971
00:39:02,331 --> 00:39:04,366
Hi.

972
00:39:04,433 --> 00:39:06,067
Are you still mad at me?

973
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:07,536
You know,
before I transferred here

974
00:39:07,603 --> 00:39:09,204
to make you my girlfriend,
I asked around about you,

975
00:39:09,272 --> 00:39:11,039
found out your rep,
what kind of girl you were.

976
00:39:11,107 --> 00:39:12,374
What did they say?
Most of them

977
00:39:12,441 --> 00:39:13,542
had no idea who you were.

978
00:39:13,609 --> 00:39:15,010
The ones that did
said you

979
00:39:15,077 --> 00:39:16,845
were kind of sneaky hot,
but that that quality

980
00:39:16,913 --> 00:39:18,813
was canceled out
by a compulsive need to be right

981
00:39:18,881 --> 00:39:20,148
and a strange affinity

982
00:39:20,216 --> 00:39:21,449
for sweaters
with animals on them.

983
00:39:21,517 --> 00:39:22,851
The most
interesting part was...

984
00:39:22,919 --> 00:39:25,120
that, even though no one
particularly liked you,

985
00:39:25,187 --> 00:39:27,455
they all said you were a person
who could be trusted.

986
00:39:27,523 --> 00:39:28,890
I still am.

987
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:32,260
I have this pathological need
to be popular, okay?

988
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,864
I... I just want people to think
I'm cool so bad sometimes

989
00:39:35,932 --> 00:39:37,699
that it just clouds
my judgment. Okay?

990
00:39:37,767 --> 00:39:39,334
As a fellow star
in the making, I'm...

991
00:39:39,402 --> 00:39:40,502
I'm sure you
can understand that.

992
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:41,937
On that level, sure.

993
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,972
But as the guy
who gave up everything

994
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,942
to be your one and only,
I just can't see past this.

995
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,510
I should have been enough
for you, Rachel.

996
00:39:51,147 --> 00:39:52,847
I knew you'd break my heart.

997
00:39:55,751 --> 00:39:58,353
Well, that's the funny thing
about reputations.

998
00:39:58,421 --> 00:40:00,655
Everyone thinks
I'm the big heartbreaker,

999
00:40:00,723 --> 00:40:03,124
but the fact of the matter is...

1000
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,260
you broke mine first.

1001
00:40:08,764 --> 00:40:10,165
Do me a favor.

1002
00:40:10,232 --> 00:40:12,167
If we end up next to each other

1003
00:40:12,234 --> 00:40:13,835
on the bar
at Ballet Club this week,

1004
00:40:13,903 --> 00:40:15,704
just do your arabesques
and piquÃÂ©s in silence.

1005
00:40:15,771 --> 00:40:17,005
Don't talk to me.

00:41:34,717 --> 00:41:38,586
¶¶ Forever's going
to start tonight ¶¶

1031
00:41:38,654 --> 00:41:40,522
<i>¶¶ Forever's going to
start tonight ¶¶</i>

1032
00:41:40,589 --> 00:41:43,692
¶¶ Once upon a time
there was light in my life ¶¶

1033
00:41:43,759 --> 00:41:46,461
¶¶ Now I'm only
falling apart ¶¶

1034
00:41:48,564 --> 00:41:50,598
¶¶ There's nothing I can say ¶¶

1035
00:41:50,666 --> 00:41:53,134
¶¶ Total eclipse of the heart ¶¶

1036
00:41:56,172 --> 00:41:58,707
¶¶ Turn around, bright eyes ¶¶

1037
00:41:58,774 --> 00:42:02,177
¶¶ Every now and then,
I fall apart ¶¶

1038
00:42:02,244 --> 00:42:04,679
¶¶ Turn around, bright eyes ¶¶

1039
00:42:04,747 --> 00:42:08,283
¶¶ Every now and then,
I fall apart ¶¶

1040
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:12,120
¶¶ And I need you now tonight ¶¶

1041
00:42:12,188 --> 00:42:14,956
¶¶ And I need you
more than ever ¶¶

1042
00:42:15,024 --> 00:42:19,227
¶¶ And we'll only
be making it right ¶¶

1043
00:42:19,295 --> 00:42:21,429
¶¶ 'Cause we'll never be wrong ¶¶

1044
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:25,066
¶¶ Together we can take it
to the end of the line ¶¶

1045
00:42:25,134 --> 00:42:27,102
¶¶ Your love is like
a shadow on me ¶¶

1046
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:30,905
<i>¶¶ All of the time ¶¶
¶¶ All of the time ¶¶</i>

1047
00:42:30,973 --> 00:42:34,175
¶¶ I don't know what to do,
I'm always in the dark ¶¶

1048
00:42:34,243 --> 00:42:39,380
¶¶ You're living in a powder keg
and giving off sparks ¶¶

1049
00:42:39,448 --> 00:42:42,117
¶¶ I really need you tonight ¶¶

1050
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:45,520
¶¶ Forever's going
to start tonight ¶¶

1051

<i>¶¶ Forever's going to
start tonight ¶¶</i>

1052
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:51,826
¶¶ Once upon a time,
I was falling in love ¶¶

1053
00:42:51,894 --> 00:42:54,295
¶¶ Now I'm only falling apart ¶¶

1054
00:42:57,299 --> 00:42:58,967
¶¶ There's nothing I can do ¶¶

1055
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:04,105
¶¶ Total eclipse of the heart ¶¶

1056
00:43:07,276 --> 00:43:11,079
¶¶ Turn around, bright eyes. ¶¶
