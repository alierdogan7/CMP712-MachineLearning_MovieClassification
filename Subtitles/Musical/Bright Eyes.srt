1
00:01:05,588 --> 00:01:07,453
<i>Taking off at 9.10.</i>

2
00:01:09,492 --> 00:01:12,358
All clear, George.
Watch for the light.

3
00:01:25,205 --> 00:01:29,665
Glendale calling NC95W.
Go ahead.

4
00:01:30,878 --> 00:01:33,972
NC95W answering Glendale.

5
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:36,242
I'll be in in about
five minutes.

6
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,976
How'd you make out, Loop?

7
00:01:38,084 --> 00:01:39,711
Did you get your passenger
there on time?

8
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:42,879
I got him there just
in time to see his wife.

9
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:44,889
Have you seen Shirley
around anywheres?

10
00:01:44,991 --> 00:01:48,051
No, not yet,
but she'll be here.

11
00:01:48,161 --> 00:01:50,628
She always is
when you come in.

12
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:20,418
Where are you goin'?

13
00:02:20,523 --> 00:02:22,616
I'm going to the airport.

14
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,625
ZJump in.
I'll give you a lift.

15
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:27,752
Thanks, mister, but I'll
have to get a faster car.

16
00:02:27,863 --> 00:02:29,660
I'm in a hurry.

17
00:02:29,765 --> 00:02:34,259
You're the most particular
hitchhiker I ever saw.

18
00:02:34,369 --> 00:02:36,929
Well, thanks, anyway.

19
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,671
Hello, Shirley.
Goin' to the airport?

20
00:02:47,782 --> 00:02:50,273
Yes, thank you.

21
00:02:50,384 --> 00:02:53,147
Come on, hop in.
That-a girl.

22
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:02,428
Hello, Loop.

23
00:03:17,642 --> 00:03:21,408
I bet you wish you
were up there with him.

24
00:03:21,513 --> 00:03:23,811
I will be someday.

25
00:03:41,864 --> 00:03:42,922
Contact.

26
00:03:43,032 --> 00:03:44,090
Contact.

27
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,100
Ha ha ha!
Come on.

28
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:50,168
Contact. Ha ha!

29
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:51,934
Hiya, Loop.

30
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,872
Hiya, Bill. Check the oil
when you gas it.

31
00:03:53,975 --> 00:03:54,942
Yowzuh.

32
00:03:55,043 --> 00:03:56,772
Come on, honey.
Up you come.

33
00:03:56,878 --> 00:03:57,936
There.

34
00:04:00,482 --> 00:04:02,211
Hello, Shirley.

35
00:04:02,317 --> 00:04:04,877
- Hello, honey. How was it, Loop?
- Hello,Jack.

36
00:04:04,986 --> 00:04:07,283
A little bumpy over the hills.
Are you off again?

37
00:04:07,388 --> 00:04:08,878
Sure. I'll be eating
my Christmas dinner...

38
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:10,923
in New York tomorrow.
Well, Merry Christmas, Shirley.

39
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:13,687
Merry Christmas
and lots of tailwind.

40
00:04:13,794 --> 00:04:16,490
- Ha ha ha! Thanks.
- So long.

41
00:04:19,365 --> 00:04:23,096
You wait here, honey.
I'll be right back.

42
00:04:23,203 --> 00:04:25,000
- Hiya, Tony.
- Good morning, sir.

43
00:04:25,104 --> 00:04:26,128
Hello, fellas.

44
00:04:34,546 --> 00:04:36,707
- Tony.
- Yes, missy?

45
00:04:36,815 --> 00:04:39,943
You didn't dust
my daddy's picture.

46
00:04:40,052 --> 00:04:41,451
Here, missy.

47
00:04:44,388 --> 00:04:47,289
You givin' your daddy
a clean face?

48
00:04:47,391 --> 00:04:50,383
Yes. Don't you think
he needs it?

49
00:04:50,494 --> 00:04:52,462
I think you do, too.

50
00:04:52,563 --> 00:04:54,121
Here. Wet.

51
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:59,968
There you are,
young lady. Come on.

52
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,401
My daddy could fly better...

53
00:05:01,504 --> 00:05:03,404
than anybody in the world,
couldn't he?

54
00:05:03,506 --> 00:05:08,375
That's right- better than
anybody in the whole world.

55
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:11,412
You know, your daddy
and I were pals...

56
00:05:11,513 --> 00:05:15,415
ever since we were
about as big as you are.

57
00:05:15,517 --> 00:05:17,417
He was my best friend.

58
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:19,419
That's why I'm your godfather.

59
00:05:19,521 --> 00:05:21,920
And then one day,
he cracked up...

60
00:05:22,023 --> 00:05:24,423
and went away to heaven,
didn't he?

61
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:25,924
That's right.

62
00:05:26,027 --> 00:05:28,928
I'll bet when I'm a flyer,
I won't crack up.

63
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,930
When you're ready
to be a flyer...

64
00:05:31,032 --> 00:05:33,625
we're gonna buy you
a great big noncrackable ship.

65
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,429
Say, that reminds me.
I found an old scrapbook...

66
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,628
the other day with some pictures
of your daddy and me in it.

67
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:39,831
- Would you like to see it?
- Oh, yes!

68
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,032
I'll get it.

69
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:46,939
- Hi, Harry. Grab some of these, will you?
- Sure.

70
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,274
Hello, honey.

71
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,814
Hello, little boy.

72
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:51,940
I'm not a little boy.
I'm a little girl.

73
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:53,609
Are you sure?

74
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:55,243
Yes, I'm sure.

75
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,652
Well, I just didn't
want to take any chances.

76
00:05:59,557 --> 00:06:01,582
Now, that's mistletoe.
And when you hold it...

77
00:06:01,693 --> 00:06:03,684
over anybody's head,
you can kiss them.

78
00:06:03,795 --> 00:06:05,194
Beat it, you chiseler.

79
00:06:05,297 --> 00:06:06,423
OK, kid.

80
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:07,725
Move over.

81
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:16,638
There's your daddy
on the day...

82
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,401
he broke
the transcontinental record.

83
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:25,012
And there's your daddy and me
when we first got our wings.

84
00:06:27,617 --> 00:06:30,586
We'll skip that.

85
00:06:30,687 --> 00:06:32,587
Wait a minute.
There ought to be...

86
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:34,088
another one
in here someplace.

87
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,680
Who's that?

88
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:41,957
A girl I used to know.

89
00:06:42,064 --> 00:06:43,964
She's a pretty lady.

90
00:06:44,066 --> 00:06:46,967
I used to think so.

91
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:49,969
But it's not enough
to be pretty here.

92
00:06:50,071 --> 00:06:53,472
You've got to be
pretty in here, too.

93
00:06:53,574 --> 00:06:57,476
How can you be
pretty in there?

94
00:06:57,578 --> 00:06:59,808
By thinking
the right thoughts...

95
00:06:59,914 --> 00:07:02,040
and doing
the right things...

96
00:07:02,148 --> 00:07:05,049
and eating plenty
of spinach. Ha ha ha!

97
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:07,551
Say, we better call up
your mother...

98
00:07:07,654 --> 00:07:09,554
before she starts
to worry about you.

99
00:07:09,656 --> 00:07:13,887
She won't worry
as long as I'm with you.

100
00:07:13,992 --> 00:07:15,892
Fledrich 4230.

101
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:25,397
Good heavens.

102
00:07:25,504 --> 00:07:27,903
Will no one
answer the phone?

103
00:07:28,005 --> 00:07:29,097
Hello.

104
00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:31,437
May I please speak
to Mrs. Blake?

105
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:33,737
Mary.

106
00:07:33,845 --> 00:07:34,903
Mary.

107
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:36,274
Yes, ma'am?

108
00:07:36,381 --> 00:07:38,008
The telephone- for you.

109
00:07:41,518 --> 00:07:43,179
Thank you.

110
00:07:43,286 --> 00:07:44,275
Hello?

111
00:07:44,388 --> 00:07:46,083
This is Loop.

112
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:49,420
I just wanted you to know
that Shirley's with me.

113
00:07:49,526 --> 00:07:50,924
Hello, Mother.

114
00:07:51,026 --> 00:07:53,790
I'll have one of the boys
drive her home later.

115
00:07:53,896 --> 00:07:56,091
All right, Loop.
Thanks.

116
00:07:57,633 --> 00:07:58,691
Mary.

117
00:07:58,801 --> 00:07:59,768
Yes, ma'am?

118
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,370
I don't approve of all
these telephone calls.

119
00:08:04,472 --> 00:08:05,871
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:05,974 --> 00:08:07,942
And I don't approve
of all these aviators...

121
00:08:08,042 --> 00:08:09,907
who keep coming here
to see your little girl.

122
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:13,378
She's sort of a pet with them.
They all knew her father.

123
00:08:13,481 --> 00:08:16,381
I know that,
but I really can't have it.

124
00:08:16,483 --> 00:08:18,576
You know it isn't everyone
who'd engage a maid...

125
00:08:18,685 --> 00:08:19,879
with a small child.

126
00:08:19,987 --> 00:08:22,455
I have no fault to find
with your work...

127
00:08:22,556 --> 00:08:24,421
but if you want
to stay on with us...

128
00:08:24,525 --> 00:08:26,049
you'll have to
correct these things.

129
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,889
Yes, ma'am, I will.

130
00:08:27,995 --> 00:08:29,689
Very well.

131
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:35,296
I told you
when you engaged her...

132
00:08:35,401 --> 00:08:36,834
that it wouldn't work out.

133
00:08:36,936 --> 00:08:38,836
Well, she was so pathetic
about wanting a nice home...

134
00:08:38,938 --> 00:08:40,428
for her little girl...

135
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,507
that I let my sympathy get
the better of my judgment.

136
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:44,837
I'll let her go
right after the holidays.

137
00:08:44,943 --> 00:08:46,069
Hmm. Fine.

138
00:08:52,851 --> 00:08:54,909
Ah. Through with
the upstairs already?

139
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:56,077
Yes.

140
00:08:57,188 --> 00:08:59,247
What's wrong, dearie?

141
00:08:59,356 --> 00:09:02,348
Mrs. Smythe doesn't want me to
have any more telephone calls.

142
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,860
She don't? Well, well, now,
ain't that too bad.

143
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:07,794
Ha! Her and
her highfalutin ways...

144
00:09:07,897 --> 00:09:10,365
and him that finicky.
They both give me a pain.

145
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,367
Tut tut, Elizabeth.
I shall not stand here...

146
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:15,302
and listen to you
defame our employers.

147
00:09:15,405 --> 00:09:16,702
What?

148
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,865
Besides, I have to go
down to the post office.

149
00:09:19,975 --> 00:09:21,203
Ha ha ha!

150
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,006
Don't forget
to pick up those things.

151
00:09:24,112 --> 00:09:26,273
What things, my love?

152
00:09:26,381 --> 00:09:28,781
Don't you remember?
The things I told you to get?

153
00:09:34,989 --> 00:09:36,456
Oh, you fool, you.

154
00:09:36,557 --> 00:09:39,287
The sewin' kit I told you
to get for Shirley.

155
00:09:39,393 --> 00:09:41,384
Oh, right.

156
00:09:43,597 --> 00:09:46,566
I wanted it to be a surprise.

157
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,066
I guess it won't matter
if you know.

158
00:09:49,169 --> 00:09:50,568
ZJust a bit
of a Christmas gift.

159
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,568
You're awfully kind.

160
00:09:51,671 --> 00:09:53,195
Aw, go on.

161
00:09:53,306 --> 00:09:56,069
I bought a few things for her.
Not very much, of course.

162
00:09:56,175 --> 00:09:59,076
It was different
when her father was alive.

163
00:09:59,178 --> 00:10:01,078
Oh, yes, the poor young fellow.

164
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,670
Well, it must be
a comfort to know...

165
00:10:02,781 --> 00:10:04,248
you're doin' the best
you can for the little one.

166
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,250
She's a sweet child.

167
00:10:06,352 --> 00:10:09,252
Not like that young one of theirs.

168
00:10:09,354 --> 00:10:11,822
There's a brat if ever one lived.

169
00:10:13,324 --> 00:10:15,019
Now, darling,
don't get yourself all excited.

170
00:10:15,126 --> 00:10:18,027
Child: I don't care! No! No!

171
00:10:18,162 --> 00:10:19,390
No! No! No!

172
00:10:19,497 --> 00:10:21,657
Darling, you must practice
your piano lesson.

173
00:10:21,765 --> 00:10:23,426
You won't have to
practice again...

174
00:10:23,534 --> 00:10:25,092
until after Santa Claus
has been here.

175
00:10:25,202 --> 00:10:27,033
There ain't any Santa Claus!

176
00:10:27,137 --> 00:10:29,367
Don't say "ain't," darling. Say "isn't. "

177
00:10:29,473 --> 00:10:31,498
Ain't! Ain't! Ain't!

178
00:10:31,608 --> 00:10:33,768
What's all this noise about?

179
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:37,277
Mother wants me to practice,
and I don't wanna!

180
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,177
You must do
as Mama says, dear.

181
00:10:39,282 --> 00:10:40,271
Well, I ain't gonna!

182
00:10:40,383 --> 00:10:41,941
Now, look here,
young woman-

183
00:10:42,051 --> 00:10:43,951
Remember what
the psychoanalyst said-

184
00:10:44,053 --> 00:10:46,452
The child mind must
never be coerced.

185
00:10:46,555 --> 00:10:49,456
One must use
persuasion and reason.

186
00:10:49,558 --> 00:10:51,355
Now, darling...

187
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:55,293
practice your lesson, and mama
will buy you something nice.

188
00:10:55,397 --> 00:10:56,455
What?

189
00:10:56,565 --> 00:10:58,862
- Anything you like.
- Anything?

190
00:10:58,966 --> 00:11:01,059
Yes, dear. What would you
especially like?

191
00:11:01,168 --> 00:11:05,537
A machine gun!
Rat-a-tat! Rat-a-tat!

192
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:08,437
Rat-a-tat! Rat-a-tat!
Rat-a-tat!

193
00:11:14,847 --> 00:11:16,781
That's a good girl.

194
00:11:20,353 --> 00:11:22,446
? 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3?

195
00:11:22,555 --> 00:11:23,816
? 1, 2, 3, 1?

196
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:28,091
? 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3...?

197
00:11:28,193 --> 00:11:32,129
Hey! Is there anybody at all
in this confounded house?

198
00:11:33,865 --> 00:11:35,764
? 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3?

199
00:11:35,866 --> 00:11:37,629
? 1, 2, 3, 1?

200
00:11:37,735 --> 00:11:40,761
Hey! Somebody! Anybody!

201
00:11:40,871 --> 00:11:44,602
Come and help me downstairs!

202
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:45,767
Hey!

203
00:11:45,876 --> 00:11:47,775
? 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3?

204
00:11:47,877 --> 00:11:50,675
So you think you're gonna make
me stay up here today, do you?

205
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,577
Well, I'll show you.

206
00:11:52,682 --> 00:11:54,809
? 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4?

207
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,088
Oh!

208
00:12:02,191 --> 00:12:03,522
Doggone it!

209
00:12:07,696 --> 00:12:09,095
Why, Uncle Ned!

210
00:12:09,198 --> 00:12:10,756
Why didn't you call us?

211
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:12,265
Call you?

212
00:12:12,368 --> 00:12:15,268
I yelled, and I shouted
and bellowed.

213
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,598
A fat lot of good it did me.

214
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:18,831
No one pays
any attention to me.

215
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,272
No one cares
what happens to me.

216
00:12:21,376 --> 00:12:23,276
All you do is think of yourselves.

217
00:12:23,378 --> 00:12:24,936
Oh, Uncle Ned,
you know that isn't so.

218
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:26,103
Mary.

219
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:28,113
Yes, Mr. Smythe?

220
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:31,116
My name is Smith!
His name is Smythe.

221
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:32,776
Yes, Mr. Smith.

222
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:34,786
Didn't you hear me holler
a little while ago?

223
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:36,788
No, sir, I didn't.

224
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,289
Folks around here had
better get their ears fixed.

225
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:40,518
That's all, Mary.

226
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:42,787
? 1 and 2 and 3 and?

227
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:45,455
? 1 and 2 and 3 and?

228
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:47,464
? 1 and 2 and 3 and?

229
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,466
? 1 and 2 and 3 and...
1 and 2 and-?

230
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:50,966
Stop it!

231
00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:52,969
? 1 and 2 and 3 and?

232
00:12:53,071 --> 00:12:55,130
Is that all you know?

233
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,298
Mama! Mama!

234
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,239
Mama. Mama.

235
00:12:58,343 --> 00:13:00,311
It's a good thing
I'm not your mama.

236
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:02,402
Why, it's enough
to drive a man crazy.

237
00:13:02,513 --> 00:13:04,242
Things better be a little
different around here...

238
00:13:04,348 --> 00:13:07,215
or you're gonna see
the last of me.

239
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:11,048
And another thing-

240
00:13:11,155 --> 00:13:12,554
You stop telling people...

241
00:13:12,656 --> 00:13:15,215
I made my money
in sanitary engineering.

242
00:13:15,324 --> 00:13:17,224
It was sewers!

243
00:13:17,326 --> 00:13:20,227
Sewers! And don't you forget it!

244
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,233
And, oh...

245
00:13:29,838 --> 00:13:32,739
How much longer
must I stand this?

246
00:13:32,841 --> 00:13:34,741
Now, now, dear. Be calm.

247
00:13:34,843 --> 00:13:36,743
That horrid man.
He's just impossible.

248
00:13:36,845 --> 00:13:38,369
Yes, I know he's trying,
but after all...

249
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,743
we can afford to be patient.
It will pay us in the end.

250
00:13:40,848 --> 00:13:43,248
Any money he leaves us
we'll have earned.

251
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,749
Yes, that's true...

252
00:13:44,852 --> 00:13:46,444
but with my business
in such condition...

253
00:13:46,554 --> 00:13:48,454
we'd better keep on
humoring him.

254
00:13:48,556 --> 00:13:51,616
And, Mama, every time
he sees me, he makes a face.

255
00:13:51,726 --> 00:13:53,522
Never mind, darling.

256
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:55,355
Well, I must be getting
down to the office.

257
00:13:55,462 --> 00:13:57,089
- Good-bye, dear.
- Good-bye.

258
00:13:57,197 --> 00:13:58,755
Good-bye, darling.

259
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:03,201
Never you mind, darling.

260
00:14:03,303 --> 00:14:05,702
Don't you let him worry you.

261
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:07,704
Sit up.
Sit up.

262
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,706
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

263
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:12,208
Miss Blake's car is ready, sir.

264
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:13,869
Very good, Meadows.

265
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,879
The royal chariot awaits, madam.

266
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:16,879
Come on.

267
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:17,879
Ha ha ha!

268
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,381
Bye, Ray.

269
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,384
I'll see you later.

270
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,681
Bye, honey. Bye.

271
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,221
Hello, Harry.

272
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,723
Hello, Shirley.

273
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,383
Hi, Shirley.

274
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:30,391
Hi.

275
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,859
Hello there.

276
00:14:46,842 --> 00:14:48,400
Mr. Higgins?

277
00:14:48,511 --> 00:14:50,240
Yes, madam?

278
00:14:50,346 --> 00:14:52,746
See that?
That's mistletoe.

279
00:14:56,684 --> 00:14:58,242
Thank you, madam.

280
00:14:59,687 --> 00:15:01,678
- Mother.
- Yes, darling?

281
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,690
May I help you
with the dishes?

282
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:06,590
No, honey, but I tell
you what you can do.

283
00:15:06,694 --> 00:15:07,751
Take this down
to the incinerator...

284
00:15:07,861 --> 00:15:09,192
and leave it there.

285
00:15:09,296 --> 00:15:10,194
All right.

286
00:15:14,802 --> 00:15:17,202
Higgins, what's that
on your face?

287
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:18,703
My face, madam?

288
00:15:18,806 --> 00:15:19,829
Yes.

289
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,108
It appears to be
chocolate, madam.

290
00:15:37,756 --> 00:15:39,519
Look out for the police car!

291
00:15:48,766 --> 00:15:50,666
Here comes the police car!

292
00:15:50,768 --> 00:15:53,100
Everybody, get out of the way!

293
00:15:54,405 --> 00:15:55,702
Everybody, get out of the way!

294
00:15:55,806 --> 00:15:57,466
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang!

295
00:16:10,252 --> 00:16:13,153
Why, you poor little thing.

296
00:16:13,255 --> 00:16:15,155
You must have cracked up.

297
00:16:15,257 --> 00:16:17,782
You should be in the hospital.

298
00:16:22,763 --> 00:16:24,663
Hey, that's my doll.

299
00:16:24,765 --> 00:16:28,667
Well, I just found her here.

300
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:30,669
You can't have her.

301
00:16:30,771 --> 00:16:32,671
You bad old thing.
You ran away from home...

302
00:16:32,773 --> 00:16:34,672
and I'm gonna spank you.

303
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:37,174
If you give her to me...

304
00:16:37,277 --> 00:16:39,609
I'll take care of her.
I'll wash her face...

305
00:16:39,713 --> 00:16:42,181
and make her some
clothes and everything.

306
00:16:42,282 --> 00:16:45,183
You can't have her!
You wanna know why?

307
00:16:45,285 --> 00:16:47,149
Because I'm gonna kill her.

308
00:16:50,122 --> 00:16:52,454
? Happy, happy, happy days?

309
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:54,685
? Happy days, happy days?

310
00:16:54,793 --> 00:16:57,023
? Happy days, happy days?

311
00:16:57,129 --> 00:16:58,926
? Happy days, happy-?

312
00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:04,029
Hey, what are you gonna
get for Christmas?

313
00:17:04,135 --> 00:17:07,366
I'm gonna get a doll house
with real furniture...

314
00:17:07,472 --> 00:17:09,372
and a little piano
and a tennis racket...

315
00:17:09,474 --> 00:17:10,736
and a great big doll.

316
00:17:10,842 --> 00:17:13,401
I asked Santy Claus
to bring me a doll.

317
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,375
Santa Claus? Pooh!

318
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:17,447
There ain't any Santa Claus.

319
00:17:17,547 --> 00:17:19,572
- There is, too.
- There is not!

320
00:17:19,683 --> 00:17:22,709
There is not, because
my psychoanalyst told me.

321
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,718
There ain't any Santa Claus.

322
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,050
There ain't any fairies
or giants or anything like that.

323
00:17:27,156 --> 00:17:29,215
I'll bet you'd feel bad...

324
00:17:29,325 --> 00:17:30,724
if you woke up
tomorrow morning...

325
00:17:30,826 --> 00:17:32,384
and you didn't
have any presents.

326
00:17:32,495 --> 00:17:35,055
Well, I won't.
You want to know why?

327
00:17:35,164 --> 00:17:38,223
'Cause I already peeked
in the closet and saw 'em.

328
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:42,269
I don't care what you saw.
There is a Santy Claus.

329
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,632
There ain't!

330
00:17:48,243 --> 00:17:49,470
Mr. Smith?

331
00:17:49,576 --> 00:17:50,668
Huh?

332
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,144
There is a Santy Claus, isn't there?

333
00:17:53,247 --> 00:17:54,976
What did she say?

334
00:17:55,082 --> 00:17:56,913
She says there isn't.

335
00:17:57,017 --> 00:17:58,416
Then there is.

336
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:01,578
You think you're smart, don't you?

337
00:18:01,688 --> 00:18:04,589
Well, I'll show you!

338
00:18:04,691 --> 00:18:06,591
You'll what?

339
00:18:06,693 --> 00:18:07,921
You'll...

340
00:18:11,631 --> 00:18:13,360
Aarrrgh!

341
00:18:13,466 --> 00:18:16,366
Get outta here!

342
00:18:16,468 --> 00:18:18,936
Go on!
Get out of here!

343
00:18:19,037 --> 00:18:21,437
Go on! Get outta here!

344
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,667
Mama! Mama!
Mama!

345
00:18:23,775 --> 00:18:25,174
Mama!

346
00:18:25,277 --> 00:18:26,675
Shirley.

347
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:31,680
Shirley, where are you?

348
00:18:33,284 --> 00:18:35,184
Here I am.

349
00:18:35,286 --> 00:18:37,982
Oh, well, my goodness.

350
00:18:44,794 --> 00:18:46,694
We got rid of her, all right.

351
00:18:46,796 --> 00:18:48,354
Thanks, Mr. Smith.

352
00:18:48,465 --> 00:18:50,365
Oh, that's all right.

353
00:18:55,304 --> 00:18:57,704
I like you.

354
00:18:57,806 --> 00:19:01,139
You're the only one
around here that does.

355
00:19:01,243 --> 00:19:02,642
They don't like me...

356
00:19:02,745 --> 00:19:07,147
and listen,
I don't like them, either.

357
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:15,986
I made the arrangements...

358
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,556
and everything's
all set for tomorrow.

359
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:18,988
It's wonderful
of you and the boys...

360
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:21,492
to give Shirley
her Christmas party.

361
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:23,426
Oh, we're getting a big kick
out of it ourselves.

362
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,656
She'll be so surprised.

363
00:19:24,765 --> 00:19:26,357
She doesn't expect much, you know.

364
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:27,660
Now, get her down to the airport...

365
00:19:27,768 --> 00:19:28,927
as early in the morning as you can.

366
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:30,400
I may not be able
to come with her...

367
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,232
but I'll be down just
as soon as I can get away.

368
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:33,430
That'll be fine.

369
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,507
Hello, Mr. Merritt.
Merry Christmas.

370
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:37,337
The same to you.

371
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:39,070
I'm just after making
myself a cup of tea.

372
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,873
- Will you have one?
- Sure.

373
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,003
Ah, fine.

374
00:19:42,113 --> 00:19:43,671
Hello, Loop.

375
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:45,682
Hiya, honey.
All ready for Christmas?

376
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:48,685
I've been ready
for a long time.

377
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:50,186
Hello, Loop.

378
00:19:50,288 --> 00:19:51,687
Hiya, Thomas.

379
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,189
All ready!

380
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,723
Come on.

381
00:19:54,825 --> 00:19:58,727
Yes, dear, I think Friday
will be all right.

382
00:19:58,829 --> 00:20:01,229
That will be fine.

383
00:20:01,331 --> 00:20:04,732
Very well. We'll make it
definite, then.

384
00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:06,631
Thank you so much
for inviting us.

385
00:20:06,736 --> 00:20:07,998
Good-bye, dear.

386
00:20:10,373 --> 00:20:12,102
This is good cake.

387
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,108
It ought to be.
I whipped it up myself.

388
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,802
How are you,
Mr. Merritt?

389
00:20:15,912 --> 00:20:17,607
The compliments
of the season to you.

390
00:20:17,713 --> 00:20:19,612
Same to you,
Mr. Higgins.

391
00:20:19,714 --> 00:20:22,615
The cup that cheers
but not inebriates.

392
00:20:22,717 --> 00:20:24,116
Ha ha ha!

393
00:20:24,219 --> 00:20:26,119
Wow! That's hot.

394
00:20:26,221 --> 00:20:28,121
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

395
00:20:28,223 --> 00:20:29,451
Higgins.

396
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:31,150
Yes, madam?

397
00:20:32,726 --> 00:20:34,956
My cousin's arriving
from New York tomorrow...

398
00:20:35,062 --> 00:20:36,461
and I want you to be sure...

399
00:20:36,564 --> 00:20:38,122
that everything
is done just right.

400
00:20:38,232 --> 00:20:39,995
Yes, madam.

401
00:20:40,101 --> 00:20:42,934
- Thomas, you will meet the plane in the morning.
- Yes, ma'am.

402
00:20:43,037 --> 00:20:45,061
I'm very anxious to show her
that we can do things...

403
00:20:45,171 --> 00:20:48,607
exactly as well out here
as they do in the East.

404
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,802
I want perfect meals
and perfect service.

405
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:53,003
Is that understood?

406
00:20:53,113 --> 00:20:54,410
Yes, ma'am.

407
00:20:54,514 --> 00:20:56,105
- And, Mary...
- Yes, ma'am?

408
00:20:56,215 --> 00:20:57,944
I hope you'll remember
what I told you...

409
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,518
this morning...
about visitors?

410
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:02,348
Yes, ma'am.

411
00:21:05,757 --> 00:21:10,022
And I don't want to
have to remind you again.

412
00:21:11,262 --> 00:21:13,162
Remember that,
Mrs. Higgins-

413
00:21:13,264 --> 00:21:15,164
Anything else than perfection...

414
00:21:15,266 --> 00:21:18,667
and, ggkktt...
off goes your head.

415
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:20,498
My head, indeed.

416
00:21:20,605 --> 00:21:23,164
You better look
after your own.

417
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,203
How can you stand working
for people like that?

418
00:21:29,312 --> 00:21:31,542
Oh, I don't mind.
Could be worse.

419
00:21:31,648 --> 00:21:34,241
Well, I guess you know
your own business best.

420
00:21:35,451 --> 00:21:38,215
Now we'll have a little pepper.

421
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,049
Good-bye, Mrs. Higgins.

422
00:21:44,326 --> 00:21:46,054
Ah-choo!

423
00:21:46,161 --> 00:21:47,890
I'll see you tomorrow.

424
00:21:47,996 --> 00:21:49,224
OK, Loop.

425
00:22:04,778 --> 00:22:06,678
Hello, dear.

426
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,680
Mother, I undressed myself.

427
00:22:08,782 --> 00:22:12,182
I put my clothes away-
all folded and everything.

428
00:22:12,285 --> 00:22:13,809
Well, you're mother's
precious little angel...

429
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,410
that's what you are.

430
00:22:15,521 --> 00:22:19,013
No, I'm not,
because angels have wings...

431
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,717
like these.

432
00:22:21,761 --> 00:22:23,990
Those are your daddy's wings.

433
00:22:24,095 --> 00:22:27,997
I know, and he's really
an angel, isn't he?

434
00:22:28,099 --> 00:22:29,498
Yes, darling.

435
00:22:35,273 --> 00:22:38,673
Now, then. Are you all ready
to hang up your stocking?

436
00:22:40,778 --> 00:22:43,178
- Mother.
- Yes, dear?

437
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,077
You know,
I was thinking today...

438
00:22:45,182 --> 00:22:47,514
- about hanging up my stocking...
- Yes?

439
00:22:47,618 --> 00:22:49,016
and I thought maybe...

440
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,848
if Santa brought me
a great big present-

441
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:55,049
of course, he mightn't-
but then if he did-

442
00:22:55,158 --> 00:22:56,455
Yes, if he did?

443
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,687
Well, you know, my stockings
are awful little.

444
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:03,595
I know. And you want mother
to lend you one of hers.

445
00:23:03,699 --> 00:23:07,692
Oh, no. I already borrowed
one of Mrs. Higgins'.

446
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,499
Oh, you did?
Ha ha ha!

447
00:23:13,808 --> 00:23:16,709
See? It's a real good, big one.

448
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:19,575
Santa Claus could get
most anything in that.

449
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,114
Shall we hang it here?

450
00:23:24,318 --> 00:23:27,218
Will it hold everything
without falling down?

451
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,220
I think it will.

452
00:23:29,322 --> 00:23:31,119
Now... say your prayers.

453
00:23:31,224 --> 00:23:32,486
Then mother
will tuck you in...

454
00:23:32,592 --> 00:23:34,822
you'll close your eyes
and go to sleep...

455
00:23:34,928 --> 00:23:36,122
and then-

456
00:23:36,229 --> 00:23:37,958
And then it will
be Christmas.

457
00:23:38,064 --> 00:23:41,927
That's right.
Now, there you are.

458
00:23:46,038 --> 00:23:49,735
Dear Lord, please bless
my mother and me...

459
00:23:49,842 --> 00:23:52,742
and Loop
and all of the aviators...

460
00:23:52,844 --> 00:23:55,244
and Mr. and Mrs. Higgins...

461
00:23:55,346 --> 00:23:59,248
and Mr. and Mrs. Smythe
and Mr. Smith-

462
00:24:00,752 --> 00:24:04,152
Do I have to ask him
to bless Joy, too?

463
00:24:04,254 --> 00:24:05,812
Yes, dear.

464
00:24:05,922 --> 00:24:07,651
And bless Joy, too...

465
00:24:07,758 --> 00:24:11,091
and make her a good girl.

466
00:24:11,194 --> 00:24:13,162
- Mother.
- What, dear?

467
00:24:13,263 --> 00:24:15,493
On account of
this is Christmas Eve...

468
00:24:15,598 --> 00:24:17,190
do you think
it will be all right...

469
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,131
if I ask something special?

470
00:24:19,235 --> 00:24:21,760
I'm sure it will.

471
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:27,141
Dear Lord,
please see my daddy...

472
00:24:27,243 --> 00:24:31,645
and wish him a merry Christmas
from my mother and me...

473
00:24:31,746 --> 00:24:34,146
and tell him we love him...

474
00:24:34,249 --> 00:24:37,912
forever and ever. Amen.

475
00:24:39,754 --> 00:24:42,153
Mother, do you think he will?

476
00:24:42,256 --> 00:24:45,157
I think on this night
of all nights...

477
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:48,660
God will listen to
the prayer of a child.

478
00:24:48,762 --> 00:24:50,662
Don't cry, Mother.

479
00:24:50,764 --> 00:24:53,664
I get lonesome for him
sometimes, darling.

480
00:24:53,766 --> 00:24:56,667
Don't be lonesome, mother.
You have me.

481
00:24:56,769 --> 00:24:59,704
Yes, my own sweet baby.

482
00:25:01,641 --> 00:25:03,302
And we're together...

483
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:05,467
and tomorrow's Christmas
and everything.

484
00:25:05,577 --> 00:25:07,204
And it'll be a merry
Christmas, won't it?

485
00:25:07,312 --> 00:25:09,143
The merriest we've ever had.

486
00:25:09,247 --> 00:25:11,147
The very, very merriest.

487
00:25:11,249 --> 00:25:12,477
All right.

488
00:25:12,584 --> 00:25:15,382
Beddy-bye.
In you go.

489
00:25:15,487 --> 00:25:18,148
1, 2, 3!

490
00:25:18,255 --> 00:25:20,655
<i>There you are-
nice and comfy.</i>

491
00:25:20,758 --> 00:25:23,659
Tell me again about
the first Christmas.

492
00:25:23,761 --> 00:25:25,661
All right.

493
00:25:25,763 --> 00:25:29,164
A long, long time ago...

494
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:32,166
three travelers came to an inn.

495
00:25:32,268 --> 00:25:34,668
And they needed
food and shelter.

496
00:25:34,771 --> 00:25:38,172
Yes, but there was no room
for them in the inn.

497
00:25:38,274 --> 00:25:41,004
And the only place
they could find to sleep...

498
00:25:41,111 --> 00:25:42,941
was in the stable.

499
00:25:43,045 --> 00:25:47,106
In the straw... with the cows.

500
00:25:47,216 --> 00:25:50,185
And there was born that night...

501
00:25:50,285 --> 00:25:53,652
a little baby boy.

502
00:26:11,705 --> 00:26:13,605
Isn't it beautiful, dear?

503
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:17,608
Merry Christmas, Uncle Ned.

504
00:26:17,711 --> 00:26:18,769
Ohhh...

505
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:22,908
Oh, look, darling.

506
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:25,313
Look, darling. Isn't she nice?

507
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:28,080
I don't want any old doll!

508
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:30,621
I wanted a wheelchair like his!

509
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,753
Little girls don't
have wheelchairs...

510
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:36,759
but you have lots of other
nice things to play with.

511
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:38,761
I don't want
anything else!

512
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:40,763
I want a wheelchair!

513
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:42,093
Ohh...

514
00:26:46,403 --> 00:26:48,428
Look, Mrs. Higgins!

515
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:50,439
Look what Santy Claus
brought me!

516
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:51,599
Oh, my! My!

517
00:26:51,708 --> 00:26:53,266
Isn't she pretty?
What's her name?

518
00:26:53,377 --> 00:26:55,345
Her name is Mary Lou...

519
00:26:55,446 --> 00:26:57,414
and Santy Claus brought me...

520
00:26:57,514 --> 00:27:00,414
a little man that dances
when you wind him up...

521
00:27:00,516 --> 00:27:02,814
and a ball and some candy...

522
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:04,580
and a sewing kit...

523
00:27:04,687 --> 00:27:06,951
with real scissors, a needle,
and everything!

524
00:27:07,056 --> 00:27:10,025
Santa Claus was
certainly good to you.

525
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:11,752
He certainly was.

526
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,260
I got every single
thing I asked for.

527
00:27:14,362 --> 00:27:16,262
I'm pretty lucky, all right.

528
00:27:16,364 --> 00:27:19,265
All right, honey.
Roy's outside waiting for you.

529
00:27:19,367 --> 00:27:21,767
Now, you run along
and see Loop...

530
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,928
and mother will be down
just as soon as she can.

531
00:27:24,038 --> 00:27:25,471
Run along, dear.

532
00:27:25,573 --> 00:27:28,440
Are you gonna take Mary Lou
to the airport with you?

533
00:27:28,542 --> 00:27:30,442
Do you think maybe
she's too young?

534
00:27:30,544 --> 00:27:32,944
Perhaps you'd better
leave her here.

535
00:27:33,047 --> 00:27:35,947
All right. Take good care
of her while I'm away.

536
00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:37,641
I certainly will, darling.

537
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,615
Hello, honey.

538
00:27:39,719 --> 00:27:40,777
Hello.

539
00:27:40,887 --> 00:27:42,787
Up you go.

540
00:27:42,889 --> 00:27:44,948
You hurry down, Mother!

541
00:27:45,058 --> 00:27:46,616
All right!

542
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,568
Hello, honey.

543
00:28:06,677 --> 00:28:08,042
Hello, Thomas.

544
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:17,078
That plane flew all the
way across this country...

545
00:28:17,187 --> 00:28:18,916
since yesterday afternoon.

546
00:28:19,022 --> 00:28:21,149
And it made a 3-point landing, too.

547
00:28:21,258 --> 00:28:23,920
That's right, honey.
Now, you stay here with Thomas.

548
00:28:24,027 --> 00:28:25,926
I'll be right back.

549
00:28:29,198 --> 00:28:30,995
Check your baggage right inside.

550
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,433
Hiya, Paul. We're expecting
you at the club, you know.

551
00:28:34,537 --> 00:28:37,403
Swell, Loop. I'll be there.
Everything all set?

552
00:28:44,212 --> 00:28:45,611
Miss Martin?

553
00:28:45,713 --> 00:28:47,578
- Yes?
- I'm Thomas, the Smythe chauffeur.

554
00:28:47,682 --> 00:28:49,013
I was sent to meet you.

555
00:28:49,117 --> 00:28:51,107
Oh, yes. Take care
of my bags, will you?

556
00:28:51,218 --> 00:28:52,617
Yes, ma'am.

557
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:54,448
You wait here, dear.

558
00:28:54,555 --> 00:28:56,284
I know who you are.

559
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,687
You do?

560
00:28:57,791 --> 00:28:59,782
Sure. You're the lady...

561
00:28:59,893 --> 00:29:02,554
who's coming to live
at our house.

562
00:29:02,662 --> 00:29:04,357
Well, you're not
littleJoy, are you?

563
00:29:04,463 --> 00:29:07,864
Oh, no. I'm Shirley.
Ha ha ha!

564
00:29:07,967 --> 00:29:09,559
Oh, I see.

565
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:11,068
Come on, honey.

566
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:12,262
Loop.

567
00:29:14,674 --> 00:29:17,107
How are you, Miss Martin?

568
00:29:18,476 --> 00:29:19,807
Isn't she the lady...

569
00:29:19,911 --> 00:29:21,742
whose picture you have
in your book?

570
00:29:21,846 --> 00:29:24,280
Yeah. She's one of them.

571
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:43,598
You see that?

572
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,100
That's all for you.

573
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:48,102
For me?

574
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:49,762
- Surprise, honey!
- Surprise!

575
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:51,430
Merry Christmas!

576
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:53,098
Merry Christmas!

577
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,156
Oh, my!

578
00:30:12,226 --> 00:30:14,126
Do you like her?

579
00:30:14,228 --> 00:30:16,253
Oh, my goodness!

580
00:30:16,364 --> 00:30:17,694
Ha ha ha!

581
00:30:17,797 --> 00:30:19,594
You'll have to give
her a name, Shirley.

582
00:30:19,699 --> 00:30:20,688
What are you
going to call her?

583
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,201
Her name is going to be...

584
00:30:24,304 --> 00:30:26,204
I know- Loopy!

585
00:30:26,306 --> 00:30:28,206
Ha ha ha!

586
00:30:28,308 --> 00:30:30,207
That's a swell name, honey.

587
00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:33,210
I'll meet you, Loop,
uh... you know.

588
00:30:33,312 --> 00:30:34,711
Let's go, gang.

589
00:30:40,552 --> 00:30:42,985
Now I've got
a present for you.

590
00:30:43,087 --> 00:30:45,214
This isn't from Santa Claus.

591
00:30:45,323 --> 00:30:48,053
This is from me to you.

592
00:30:50,828 --> 00:30:52,489
That's a magic ring, see?

593
00:30:52,597 --> 00:30:55,156
ZJust like they have
in the fairy tales.

594
00:30:55,265 --> 00:30:57,665
Now, if ever
you're in trouble...

595
00:30:57,768 --> 00:31:01,636
or ever you want me
to do anything for you...

596
00:31:01,738 --> 00:31:03,729
you send me this ring,
and I'll come.

597
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,638
It's pretty. Thanks, Loop.

598
00:31:06,743 --> 00:31:09,142
How much do you love me?

599
00:31:09,245 --> 00:31:10,644
Is that all?

600
00:31:10,746 --> 00:31:12,145
- Mmhh!
- Ha ha ha!

601
00:31:12,248 --> 00:31:14,182
I wish Mother
would hurry...

602
00:31:14,283 --> 00:31:15,648
so she could see all I got.

603
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:18,743
She'll be here.
We're just beginning.

604
00:31:20,188 --> 00:31:22,213
I do wish that man
from the bakery...

605
00:31:22,323 --> 00:31:24,052
would get here
with the cake.

606
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,820
He's sure to be here
in a few minutes.

607
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:27,519
I don't want to miss
any of the party.

608
00:31:27,629 --> 00:31:29,062
No, of course you don't.

609
00:31:30,632 --> 00:31:33,498
Mary, where's your little girl?

610
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,033
She's gone to a Christmas party.

611
00:31:35,135 --> 00:31:37,035
I don't believe in Christmas.

612
00:31:37,137 --> 00:31:38,035
You don't?

613
00:31:38,138 --> 00:31:39,537
No. It's a lot of nonsense.

614
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,902
Well, I don't feel
that way about it.

615
00:31:41,008 --> 00:31:42,066
Well, I do!

616
00:31:43,343 --> 00:31:45,037
Here-

617
00:31:45,144 --> 00:31:49,205
Buy a Christmas present
for Shirley from me.

618
00:31:49,315 --> 00:31:50,873
Christmas! Ugh!

619
00:31:55,621 --> 00:31:58,521
Now, what do
you make of that?

620
00:31:58,623 --> 00:32:00,523
He never fooled me.

621
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:02,957
He's only tough
on the outside.

622
00:32:03,061 --> 00:32:05,621
Inside he's soft as mush.

623
00:32:05,731 --> 00:32:07,562
How 'bout it, Loop?

624
00:32:07,666 --> 00:32:09,565
I wanted to wait
for Mrs. Blake...

625
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:11,066
but I guess
we better get going.

626
00:32:11,168 --> 00:32:12,260
When she comes,
give me the flag...

627
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:13,563
so I can stop
and take her on.

628
00:32:13,671 --> 00:32:14,569
OK, Loop.

629
00:32:14,672 --> 00:32:16,537
What are we going to do?

630
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,369
I've got it all fixed...

631
00:32:18,476 --> 00:32:20,034
for you to have your party
in the big ship.

632
00:32:20,144 --> 00:32:22,043
Are we going to go up?

633
00:32:22,145 --> 00:32:23,737
No, but we're gonna taxi
all over the field.

634
00:32:23,847 --> 00:32:25,542
Won't that be swell?

635
00:32:25,648 --> 00:32:26,979
Oh, boy!

636
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:28,880
Come on.

637
00:32:28,985 --> 00:32:30,748
We want Shirley!

638
00:32:30,854 --> 00:32:32,219
We want Shirley!

639
00:32:32,322 --> 00:32:33,880
We want Shirley!

640
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,822
Have a good time, Shirley.

641
00:32:36,925 --> 00:32:39,655
- Yay!
- Yay!

642
00:32:39,762 --> 00:32:41,161
Surprise!

643
00:32:41,263 --> 00:32:42,662
Surprise!

644
00:32:42,765 --> 00:32:44,733
Hi, Shirley.

645
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:46,095
OK, Loop.

646
00:32:46,201 --> 00:32:48,600
Ha ha ha!

647
00:32:48,703 --> 00:32:50,603
Ha ha ha!

648
00:32:50,705 --> 00:32:53,640
Turn on the radio, Bill.

649
00:33:05,285 --> 00:33:07,082
If I close my eyes...

650
00:33:07,187 --> 00:33:10,088
I can make believe
I'm really flying.

651
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:13,124
Now I'm way, way up.

652
00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:19,090
I wish mother was here.

653
00:33:19,198 --> 00:33:21,098

654

655
00:33:23,202 --> 00:33:25,465
<i>The orchestra will play
our theme song.</i>

656
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,935
You know that song,
don't you?

657
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:29,097
- Sure, I do.
- Well, then sing it. Come on.

658
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:30,434
Come on, Shirley, sing it.

659
00:33:37,447 --> 00:33:41,474

660
00:33:41,585 --> 00:33:44,110

661
00:33:45,455 --> 00:33:48,515

665
00:33:59,836 --> 00:34:02,030
? And when I do?

666
00:34:02,137 --> 00:34:03,968

667
00:34:04,072 --> 00:34:06,870

00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,611
Ha ha ha ha!

713
00:36:41,718 --> 00:36:44,914
Ha ha ha ha!

714
00:36:49,725 --> 00:36:51,625
Well, you're here at last!

715
00:36:51,727 --> 00:36:52,625
Yes, ma'am.

716
00:36:52,728 --> 00:36:54,127
I want you to see it.

717
00:36:54,229 --> 00:36:55,628
Here you are.

718
00:36:55,731 --> 00:36:57,288
Thank you, ma'am.
Merry Christmas to you.

719
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:00,098
Ohhh!

720
00:37:00,201 --> 00:37:01,463
Oh, ain't that pretty?

721
00:37:01,569 --> 00:37:03,503
Why, it's far too nice to eat...

722
00:37:03,604 --> 00:37:04,662
if you ask me.

723
00:37:04,772 --> 00:37:05,966
I'll save a piece for you anyway.

724
00:37:06,073 --> 00:37:07,199
Now I must dash.

725
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,968
- Here, I'll hand it to you.
- Thanks.

726
00:37:09,075 --> 00:37:10,940
Well, good-bye, now.

727
00:37:11,044 --> 00:37:11,942
Good-bye.

728
00:37:12,045 --> 00:37:14,240
Bye. Have a good time.

729
00:37:23,222 --> 00:37:24,712
Look out!

730
00:37:24,823 --> 00:37:25,915
Aah!

731
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:33,195
That man was on the wrong
side of the road.

732
00:37:33,298 --> 00:37:34,958
He was going too fast.

733
00:37:37,835 --> 00:37:39,962
Why don't we get the doctor?

734
00:37:48,779 --> 00:37:50,337
Do you live in town here?

735
00:37:50,447 --> 00:37:52,176
Yes. But she ran
right in front of me.

736
00:37:52,282 --> 00:37:54,011
I didn't even have a chance
to put on my brakes.

737
00:37:54,117 --> 00:37:55,516
Why, it's Mary!

738
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:57,018
You know her?

739
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,609
Yes. She works for the same people I do.

740
00:37:58,721 --> 00:38:00,916
Come on, let's take her over
to the curb. Give me a hand.

741
00:38:05,027 --> 00:38:05,959
Who was it?

742
00:38:06,062 --> 00:38:07,552
It was Mary, our maid...

743
00:38:07,663 --> 00:38:10,223
the mother of the little girl
you saw at the airport.

744
00:38:10,332 --> 00:38:11,263
Ohhh...

745
00:38:35,055 --> 00:38:36,453
Fare, please.

746
00:38:36,556 --> 00:38:38,456
I paid you already!

747
00:38:38,558 --> 00:38:41,459
Oh! So you did!
Ha ha ha!

748
00:38:41,561 --> 00:38:42,960
Hey, Loop, look!

749
00:38:45,932 --> 00:38:47,957
Hey, Bill, hold it a minute.

750
00:39:09,453 --> 00:39:10,920
What's the matter?

751
00:39:11,021 --> 00:39:13,352
I've got bad news for you.

752
00:39:13,456 --> 00:39:15,219
Well, what happened?

753
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:31,371
There's no use breaking
it to her right now.

754
00:39:31,473 --> 00:39:33,373
I'll tell her later.

755
00:39:42,984 --> 00:39:44,884
I can't say thanks, but...

756
00:39:46,487 --> 00:39:48,387
I want you to know
I appreciate you...

757
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:50,389
coming down here to tell me.

758
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:52,890
Wouldn't you let me go along?

759
00:39:52,993 --> 00:39:54,893
If you don't mind...

760
00:39:54,995 --> 00:39:57,395
I'd rather be alone with her.

761
00:39:57,497 --> 00:39:59,397
I understand.

762
00:40:14,313 --> 00:40:15,745
Honey?

763
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:22,752
How much do you love me?

764
00:40:24,322 --> 00:40:25,721
Mmhh!

765
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:27,256
Mmm.

766
00:40:41,337 --> 00:40:43,237
I'll never forget this day.

767
00:40:43,339 --> 00:40:47,275
It's the best I've ever
had in my whole life.

768
00:40:48,844 --> 00:40:51,039
Good-bye, Shirley.
Had a swell time...

769
00:40:51,147 --> 00:40:52,546
at your party.

770
00:40:52,648 --> 00:40:53,807
- Bye, Shirley!
- We'll have another one soon.

771
00:40:53,915 --> 00:40:55,246
Swell dance.

772
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,874
Good-bye, Shirley.

773
00:40:56,985 --> 00:40:58,885
We have to go back.

774
00:40:58,987 --> 00:41:00,284
So long, Shirley.

775
00:41:00,388 --> 00:41:01,878
Bye.

776
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:04,390
Is it all over now, Loop?

777
00:41:04,492 --> 00:41:05,890
No.

778
00:41:05,993 --> 00:41:08,894
They have to go
back to work...

779
00:41:08,996 --> 00:41:10,896
but we're just starting.

780
00:41:10,998 --> 00:41:12,898
Now, because today is Christmas...

781
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,400
you can do anything
that you want to do.

782
00:41:15,502 --> 00:41:17,732
What would you like
to do best of all?

783
00:41:17,837 --> 00:41:19,702
You know. Fly.

784
00:41:21,007 --> 00:41:22,907
That's just what I thought.

785
00:41:23,009 --> 00:41:24,374
Hey, Bill.

786
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:37,921
All right, Shirley...

787
00:41:38,023 --> 00:41:39,923
we're goin' for a ride...

788
00:41:40,025 --> 00:41:41,424
just you and I.

789
00:41:41,526 --> 00:41:43,425
You mean way up high?

790
00:41:43,527 --> 00:41:44,425
Yep...

791
00:41:44,528 --> 00:41:45,927
way up high.

792
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,395
Come on.

793
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:30,870
Ooh! We're going up!

794
00:42:30,972 --> 00:42:32,371
That's right.

795
00:42:32,473 --> 00:42:34,440
We're going way up.

796
00:42:35,976 --> 00:42:38,376
Do you know
where we're going?

797
00:42:38,478 --> 00:42:39,877
No.

798
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:42,380
We're goin'
right up to heaven.

799
00:42:42,482 --> 00:42:44,916
- We are?
- Mm-hmm.

800
00:42:53,993 --> 00:42:55,426
You know, Shirley...

801
00:42:56,996 --> 00:42:58,895
heaven's
a very nice place.

802
00:42:58,997 --> 00:43:02,364
If we're good,
we'll all live there someday.

803
00:43:02,467 --> 00:43:04,367
Yes, I know.

804
00:43:04,469 --> 00:43:07,370
My mother and father
are there now.

805
00:43:07,472 --> 00:43:09,337
So is my daddy.

806
00:43:14,978 --> 00:43:16,878
We're up pretty high now.

807
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,880
Are we getting near it?

808
00:43:18,982 --> 00:43:20,882
We're right in it now.

809
00:43:20,984 --> 00:43:23,816
It's all around us,
everyplace you look.

810
00:43:29,225 --> 00:43:32,285
It must be a awful big place.

811
00:43:32,395 --> 00:43:35,158
It is, honey.

812
00:43:40,402 --> 00:43:41,801
Shirley...

813
00:43:41,903 --> 00:43:44,303
I've got somethin' to tell you.

814
00:43:44,406 --> 00:43:45,805
A story?

815
00:43:45,907 --> 00:43:47,806
No, not a story.

816
00:43:47,908 --> 00:43:49,842
You know...

817
00:43:51,412 --> 00:43:54,313
ever since your daddy
went to heaven...

818
00:43:54,415 --> 00:43:57,816
your mother's been
awful lonesome for him.

819
00:43:57,918 --> 00:43:59,817
Yes, I know.

820
00:43:59,919 --> 00:44:02,547
Sometimes she cries
and everything.

821
00:44:02,655 --> 00:44:04,384
Well...

822
00:44:04,491 --> 00:44:07,892
today your mother
got so lonesome for your daddy...

823
00:44:07,994 --> 00:44:10,622
that she went to see him.

824
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,866
All the way up to heaven?

825
00:44:16,969 --> 00:44:18,903
Yep.

826
00:44:19,004 --> 00:44:21,370
All the way up to heaven.

827
00:44:23,509 --> 00:44:25,635
They're up there together now.

828
00:44:27,011 --> 00:44:28,911
You mean...

829
00:44:29,013 --> 00:44:32,414
my mother cracked up, too?

830
00:44:32,517 --> 00:44:33,882
Yes.

831
00:44:56,539 --> 00:44:59,440
Would you take these off
for the little girl?

832
00:44:59,542 --> 00:45:01,442
I think I would.

833
00:45:01,544 --> 00:45:03,340
What's to become of her now?

834
00:45:03,445 --> 00:45:05,777
I don't suppose the Smythes
will do anything for her.

835
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,348
Oh, not them.
They're far too selfish.

836
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:10,543
- Elizabeth-
- Huh?

837
00:45:12,454 --> 00:45:14,354
No, we couldn't do it.

838
00:45:14,456 --> 00:45:16,855
Oh, how I'd love to have her.

839
00:45:16,957 --> 00:45:18,515
She's such a sweet child.

840
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:19,717
But if we took her...

841
00:45:19,827 --> 00:45:21,385
we'd have to give up
our place here...

842
00:45:21,495 --> 00:45:24,157
and it mightn't be so easy
gettin' another one.

843
00:45:24,264 --> 00:45:25,629
That's what I was thinking.

844
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,359
Well, I've checked up.

845
00:45:29,469 --> 00:45:32,370
As far as I can find out,
there are no relatives.

846
00:45:32,472 --> 00:45:33,871
Now what are we to do?

847
00:45:33,973 --> 00:45:35,338
There's nothing for us to do.

848
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,908
It's no concern of ours.

849
00:45:37,009 --> 00:45:39,909
We have neither a legal
nor a moral responsibility.

850
00:45:40,011 --> 00:45:43,378
I know that, but after all,
the woman worked for us.

851
00:45:43,482 --> 00:45:46,076
People will naturally
expect us to do something.

852
00:45:46,184 --> 00:45:48,049
Maybe one of those aviators...

853
00:45:48,153 --> 00:45:50,383
would like to adopt her.

854
00:45:50,489 --> 00:45:53,013
Well, if they do,
let them go to court.

855
00:45:53,123 --> 00:45:54,556
All that we can do
is to see...

856
00:45:54,658 --> 00:45:56,387
that the little girl
is placed in an institution...

857
00:45:56,494 --> 00:45:57,654
where she'll be cared for.

858
00:45:57,761 --> 00:45:59,922
I'll speak to judge Thompson about it.

859
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:01,759
Oh, no, you won't!

860
00:46:01,866 --> 00:46:03,493
Oh. Uncle Ned!

861
00:46:03,601 --> 00:46:05,192
Did I hear you say
you were gonna put...

862
00:46:05,301 --> 00:46:06,768
little Bright Eyes
in an orphan asylum?

863
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:07,996
Who?

864
00:46:08,104 --> 00:46:10,868
Shirley. Bright Eyes, I call her.

865
00:46:10,974 --> 00:46:13,534
I don't care what you call her.

866
00:46:13,643 --> 00:46:15,201
Well, now, Uncle Ned,
you see, uh...

867
00:46:15,311 --> 00:46:16,744
Anita and I have talked
the matter over...

868
00:46:16,846 --> 00:46:18,107
and we've decided...

869
00:46:18,213 --> 00:46:19,737
that since there are
apparently no relatives...

870
00:46:19,848 --> 00:46:21,042
and since of course...

871
00:46:21,149 --> 00:46:22,548
it's impossible for us
to keep Shirley-

872
00:46:22,651 --> 00:46:24,050
Why is it impossible?

873
00:46:24,152 --> 00:46:26,712
Well, really, Uncle Ned,
you could hardly expect us...

874
00:46:26,822 --> 00:46:29,483
to raise our littleJoy
with the child of a servant.

875
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:31,820
Servant, my eye!

876
00:46:31,926 --> 00:46:34,292
She was just as good as you are.

877
00:46:34,395 --> 00:46:35,987
I don't know where
you get the idea...

878
00:46:36,097 --> 00:46:37,394
you're so high and mighty.

879
00:46:37,498 --> 00:46:39,932
Why, your father
was a retail butcher!

880
00:46:40,034 --> 00:46:42,934
And your father started
life as a bricklayer!

881
00:46:43,036 --> 00:46:44,936
Why, really, Uncle Ned...

882
00:46:45,038 --> 00:46:46,767
you-you mustn't get so excited.

883
00:46:46,873 --> 00:46:49,842
Well, I will if I want to.

884
00:46:49,943 --> 00:46:52,275
Now, listen to me, you two.

885
00:46:52,379 --> 00:46:55,438
I want you to understand
just one thing.

886
00:46:55,548 --> 00:46:57,948
If you ever expect
to get anything out of me...

887
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:00,644
you're going to be human
enough and decent enough...

888
00:47:00,753 --> 00:47:03,449
to take Shirley
into this house to live.

889
00:47:03,589 --> 00:47:05,989
I'll pay for her board
and her clothes.

890
00:47:06,091 --> 00:47:08,820
Oh, that wouldn't
be necessary, Uncle Ned.

891
00:47:08,927 --> 00:47:11,487
Of course, Uncle Ned.
We had no idea...

892
00:47:11,596 --> 00:47:13,120
you felt this way
about the child.

893
00:47:13,231 --> 00:47:14,289
Well, I do...

894
00:47:14,399 --> 00:47:15,661
and if you
don't want her here...

895
00:47:15,767 --> 00:47:18,167
I guess I can find
some other place for her.

896
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:25,935
And listen...

897
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:28,375
I can find another place
for me, too.

898
00:47:38,387 --> 00:47:40,855
Well, this is going
to be perfectly lovely.

899
00:47:40,957 --> 00:47:43,016
Well, you engaged the woman
against my advice.

900
00:47:43,125 --> 00:47:44,352
I told you not to do it.

901
00:47:44,459 --> 00:47:46,290
Are you blaming me
because the woman died...

902
00:47:46,394 --> 00:47:48,191
and left a child
on our hands?

903
00:47:48,296 --> 00:47:49,593
I'm merely pointing out-

904
00:47:49,698 --> 00:47:51,427
Well, don't bother
pointing anything out.

905
00:47:51,533 --> 00:47:53,000
Uncle Ned?

906
00:47:55,804 --> 00:47:57,532
What do you think?

907
00:47:57,638 --> 00:48:00,198
I think you're an old softy.

908
00:48:00,307 --> 00:48:03,140
Well, would you let them put
a child like that in a home?

909
00:48:03,243 --> 00:48:05,507
<i>In my home.</i>

910
00:48:05,613 --> 00:48:07,672
You're not like those two in there.

911
00:48:07,781 --> 00:48:09,680
You're more like me.

912
00:48:09,782 --> 00:48:11,010
Where's Shirley now?

913
00:48:11,117 --> 00:48:12,846
She's down at
the airport with Loop.

914
00:48:12,952 --> 00:48:15,682
Loop? Who's Loop?

915
00:48:15,788 --> 00:48:19,690
Oh. He's that aviator fellow
you were interested in.

916
00:48:19,792 --> 00:48:20,690
Yes.

917
00:48:20,793 --> 00:48:22,350
Uh-huh. Well, uh...

918
00:48:22,461 --> 00:48:25,396
you go down yourself
and bring her back.

919
00:48:27,466 --> 00:48:29,366
I'll go right now.

920
00:48:33,271 --> 00:48:35,261
Whrrr!

921
00:48:42,813 --> 00:48:44,906
How was the trip
to Ensenada?

922
00:48:45,016 --> 00:48:47,176
Terrific. I didn't
have a minute to myself.

923
00:48:47,283 --> 00:48:48,682
I'm gonna sleep from now on.

924
00:48:48,785 --> 00:48:49,911
Hey, Bob.

925
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,647
That's right.

926
00:48:51,755 --> 00:48:53,586
Come on. We're goin'
to San Francisco right away!

927
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:54,748
Oh, boy!

928
00:49:00,029 --> 00:49:01,553
How'd you like to make a livin'...

929
00:49:01,664 --> 00:49:02,824
flying a guy like that?

930
00:49:02,931 --> 00:49:04,899
Don't squawk.
He could've said Paris!

931
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,093
Ha ha ha!

932
00:49:07,202 --> 00:49:09,898
Whrrr!

933
00:49:10,005 --> 00:49:12,404
Watch, Loop.
I'm gonna bank.

934
00:49:15,843 --> 00:49:18,869
Ha ha ha ha ha!

935
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:20,811
Ha ha ha ha!

936
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:25,350
We should've had
our belts on.

937
00:49:25,452 --> 00:49:27,352
You didn't make a bank.

938
00:49:27,454 --> 00:49:29,786
You did a barrel roll!

939
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:31,790
Now, always remember
one thing-

940
00:49:31,892 --> 00:49:34,861
If you bank too sharply,
you're liable to go into a sideslip.

941
00:49:34,961 --> 00:49:36,450
That's what I did, all right.

942
00:49:36,562 --> 00:49:39,554
I went into a sideslip.

943
00:49:39,665 --> 00:49:41,292
Oh, you!

944
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,300
May I come in?

945
00:49:46,439 --> 00:49:47,428
Hello.

946
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:48,768
Hello. How are you, dear?

947
00:49:48,873 --> 00:49:51,706
I'm fine, and I'm glad
you came to see me.

948
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:53,539
Come on and see Loop.

949
00:49:56,915 --> 00:49:58,815
What can I do for you?

950
00:49:58,917 --> 00:50:01,817
I want to talk to you... privately.

951
00:50:01,919 --> 00:50:04,945
Shirley, run over
to the radio room and see...

952
00:50:05,055 --> 00:50:06,784
if the American Airlines
ship is on time.

953
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:11,224
Why, it was on time
when we asked a while ago.

954
00:50:12,763 --> 00:50:15,424
Well, then, uh...
run over to the hangar...

955
00:50:15,531 --> 00:50:17,362
and find out
if they've gassed my ship.

956
00:50:17,467 --> 00:50:20,925
Well, I know they did
because I watched them.

957
00:50:21,037 --> 00:50:23,505
Come on, take off,
will you, please?

958
00:50:23,606 --> 00:50:24,732
OK.

959
00:50:26,308 --> 00:50:27,832
Whrrr!

960
00:50:29,311 --> 00:50:32,212
Well, you might
ask me to sit down.

961
00:50:32,314 --> 00:50:33,713
I might.

962
00:50:33,815 --> 00:50:35,715
Why are you so bitter?

963
00:50:35,817 --> 00:50:37,717
You ought to know.

964
00:50:37,819 --> 00:50:39,718
Can't you forget the past?

965
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:42,721
Sure. I can forget a lot of things.

966
00:50:42,823 --> 00:50:46,224
I can forget that
you and I were in love...

967
00:50:46,327 --> 00:50:49,228
and we were engaged
to be married...

968
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:52,230
and that you
walked out on me.

969
00:50:52,332 --> 00:50:56,132
All that is just
as dead as this.

970
00:50:58,338 --> 00:51:00,238
But I can't forget
that you made a fool of me.

971
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,706
A man usually
remembers that.

972
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,708
Would it make
any difference...

973
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:06,710
if I said I'm sorry?

974
00:51:06,812 --> 00:51:09,212
Not a bit.
It's a little too late.

975
00:51:09,314 --> 00:51:11,544
You didn't come
all the way over here...

976
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:13,845
just to tell me that, did you?

977
00:51:13,952 --> 00:51:16,385
No. I came to talk
about Shirley.

978
00:51:16,487 --> 00:51:17,852
What about her?

979
00:51:17,955 --> 00:51:20,219
The Smythes want her to
come and live with them.

980
00:51:20,324 --> 00:51:22,053
Now I'll tell one.

981
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,492
- I mean, Uncle Ned-
- Wait a minute.

982
00:51:24,595 --> 00:51:27,428
You mean you and Uncle Ned
sold the Smythes the idea.

983
00:51:27,532 --> 00:51:29,089
They don't like it
any too well...

984
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:31,099
but in order to keep in good
with Uncle Ned, they'll do it.

985
00:51:31,201 --> 00:51:32,668
Is that right?

986
00:51:32,769 --> 00:51:34,066
You're being very unfair.

987
00:51:34,171 --> 00:51:36,162
Nothing doing.
You can't have her.

988
00:51:36,273 --> 00:51:38,241
Don't let your feeling
against me...

989
00:51:38,341 --> 00:51:40,400
interfere with the
little girl's future.

990
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:42,909
I know her father
was your best friend.

991
00:51:43,012 --> 00:51:44,877
I know you love her very dearly.

992
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:48,211
If you do, you must surely
see that she can't live here...

993
00:51:48,317 --> 00:51:51,218
in a barracks
with a lot of men!

994
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,913
They're pretty good men.

995
00:51:54,022 --> 00:51:56,252
Even so, if there was ever a time...

996
00:51:56,357 --> 00:51:59,622
when a child needed women
around her, it's now!

997
00:51:59,727 --> 00:52:02,218
Oh, I know she can't stay here...

998
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:04,355
but on the other hand,
I'm not so sure...

999
00:52:04,465 --> 00:52:06,227
the Smythes are the right
people for her to be with.

1000
00:52:06,333 --> 00:52:08,733
But I'm going to take
care of her myself.

1001
00:52:08,836 --> 00:52:11,236
- What about when you go east?
- I'll take her with me.

1002
00:52:11,338 --> 00:52:14,239
Oh, no, you won't. Anyhow,
I'm figuring on getting a house...

1003
00:52:14,341 --> 00:52:16,901
and hiring a woman
to take care of Shirley.

1004
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:19,273
But that'll take
a little time, won't it?

1005
00:52:19,378 --> 00:52:21,710
Oh, I suppose so.

1006
00:52:24,851 --> 00:52:27,251
I'll tell you what I'll do.

1007
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:29,753
You can take her for now,
but only with the understanding...

1008
00:52:29,856 --> 00:52:32,551
that when I get a place for her,
Shirley comes with me.

1009
00:52:32,657 --> 00:52:34,056
I love that baby.

1010
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:36,252
I understand how you feel.

1011
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:41,094
And, Loop, no matter
what you think of me...

1012
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:44,292
I think you're the finest
man I've ever known.

1013
00:52:44,401 --> 00:52:47,962
There was a time I thought
you were pretty swell, too.

1014
00:52:49,773 --> 00:52:52,173
Say, Loop,
American Airlines ship is-

1015
00:52:52,276 --> 00:52:55,677
Oh, now I forgot whether
it's four minutes late...

1016
00:52:55,779 --> 00:52:57,678
or four minutes early.

1017
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,873
Never mind.
Come here.

1018
00:53:05,255 --> 00:53:07,655
Honey, would you
like to go back...

1019
00:53:07,757 --> 00:53:10,247
to the Smythes' house
and live there?

1020
00:53:10,359 --> 00:53:11,917
Do I have to?

1021
00:53:12,027 --> 00:53:15,656
For a little while, dear.
We think you should.

1022
00:53:15,764 --> 00:53:18,164
Are you gonna be there?

1023
00:53:18,267 --> 00:53:21,167
Yes, I am, and we'll be
together every day.

1024
00:53:21,269 --> 00:53:23,703
If you're there,
it'll be fine.

1025
00:53:23,804 --> 00:53:27,706
I like you,
and I like Mr. Smith, too.

1026
00:53:27,808 --> 00:53:30,709
All right. Then it's all set.

1027
00:53:32,313 --> 00:53:35,213
Can Loop come
live with us, too?

1028
00:53:35,315 --> 00:53:37,715
Oh, no, dear.
ZJust at the moment...

1029
00:53:37,817 --> 00:53:39,717
I'm afraid that
can't be arranged.

1030
00:53:39,819 --> 00:53:42,219
Oh, no! Not a chance!

1031
00:53:44,291 --> 00:53:46,224
Here, Rags. Here, Rags. Come on.

1032
00:53:46,325 --> 00:53:49,226
I'm gonna let you take
Rags with you, too.

1033
00:53:49,328 --> 00:53:51,728
Oh, goody!
Good old Ragsy.

1034
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:53,229
Thanks, Loop.

1035
00:53:53,332 --> 00:53:54,731
Oh, that's all right.

1036
00:53:54,833 --> 00:53:57,893
I might as well give
the dog a break, too.

1037
00:53:58,003 --> 00:53:59,299
Don't worry about her.

1038
00:53:59,404 --> 00:54:01,235
Come see her
whenever you like.

1039
00:54:01,339 --> 00:54:02,772
Much obliged.

1040
00:54:05,276 --> 00:54:06,709
So long, sweets.

1041
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,338
If you don't like it there...

1042
00:54:10,448 --> 00:54:12,847
remember what I told you
about the magic ring.

1043
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:13,974
Send it to me...

1044
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,642
and I'll come and get you.

1045
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,187
Good-bye.

1046
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:22,690
Good-bye.

1047
00:54:22,793 --> 00:54:24,191
Good-bye, Loop.

1048
00:54:24,293 --> 00:54:25,658
Come on, Ragsy.

1049
00:54:38,306 --> 00:54:40,206
Do you have
much trouble...

1050
00:54:40,308 --> 00:54:42,208
with your little girl?

1051
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:44,210
Oh, no. She's very good.

1052
00:54:44,312 --> 00:54:46,212
She sleeps all the time.

1053
00:54:46,314 --> 00:54:49,714
Well, I have to spank
mine every day...

1054
00:54:49,817 --> 00:54:52,217
and give her castor oil.

1055
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:54,219
Now,just listen to her.

1056
00:54:54,321 --> 00:54:56,221
She's crying again!

1057
00:54:56,323 --> 00:54:59,190
Stop crying!
Stop this minute!

1058
00:55:00,927 --> 00:55:03,555
They seem to get along all right.

1059
00:55:03,663 --> 00:55:06,063
Why, of course.
Anyone could get along with Joy...

1060
00:55:06,165 --> 00:55:09,066
but I still think
it's a dreadful imposition.

1061
00:55:09,168 --> 00:55:11,398
I know, but, uh...
it won't last forever.

1062
00:55:11,504 --> 00:55:12,801
What do you mean?

1063
00:55:12,905 --> 00:55:14,735
Well, we can humor
Uncle Ned for a while...

1064
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,330
and then later on,
I can convince him...

1065
00:55:16,441 --> 00:55:18,409
that the child will be
better off somewhere else.

1066
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:20,808
Shirley is just
one of his whims.

1067
00:55:20,912 --> 00:55:22,504
He'll get tired of her
one of these days.

1068
00:55:22,614 --> 00:55:24,582
I hope so.

1069
00:55:26,717 --> 00:55:27,877
Well, ladies...

1070
00:55:27,985 --> 00:55:30,112
taking your children
out for an airing?

1071
00:55:30,221 --> 00:55:32,121
I'm taking my little girl
to the hospital.

1072
00:55:32,223 --> 00:55:34,623
She's very sick...

1073
00:55:34,725 --> 00:55:38,091
and I'm afraid she'll have
to have an operation.

1074
00:55:38,194 --> 00:55:40,128
Huh. Is that so?

1075
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:43,631
Yeah. They'll probably
have to cut her leg off.

1076
00:55:43,733 --> 00:55:45,166
Maybe both legs.

1077
00:55:46,736 --> 00:55:49,102
And what's wrong
with your child?

1078
00:55:49,205 --> 00:55:50,728
Nothing. She's fine.

1079
00:55:50,839 --> 00:55:53,239
The only thing
about her is...

1080
00:55:53,342 --> 00:55:56,436
she just won't eat
her spinach.

1081
00:55:56,545 --> 00:56:00,709
Well, we must be going.
Come, Shirley.

1082
00:56:08,756 --> 00:56:10,155
Let's play hospital.

1083
00:56:10,258 --> 00:56:13,785
I'll be the doctor,
and you can be the nurse.

1084
00:56:13,895 --> 00:56:16,158
I'll get a big knife
out of the kitchen...

1085
00:56:16,263 --> 00:56:18,663
and we'll operate
on your doll.

1086
00:56:18,765 --> 00:56:20,790
I don't want Mary Lou
to be operated on.

1087
00:56:20,901 --> 00:56:23,301
I don't care.
You have to do as I say...

1088
00:56:23,403 --> 00:56:25,234
and play the way I want to.

1089
00:56:25,338 --> 00:56:27,238
- I don't, either.
- Yes, you do.

1090
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:28,966
This is my house
and my yard...

1091
00:56:29,075 --> 00:56:31,600
and you're nothing
but an old charity.

1092
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:37,046
- I am not!
- Yes, you are, 'cause I heard my papa tell my mama.

1093
00:56:42,187 --> 00:56:44,621
Let's do something else.

1094
00:56:44,722 --> 00:56:47,691
Do you want to play a game?

1095
00:56:47,792 --> 00:56:49,259
What kind of a game?

1096
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,258
Train wreck.

1097
00:56:50,361 --> 00:56:51,453
How do you play it?

1098
00:56:51,563 --> 00:56:52,790
I'll show you.

1099
00:56:52,896 --> 00:56:55,729
You stand right here
and don't move.

1100
00:56:57,734 --> 00:57:00,703
All right, now, don't move.
Here comes the train!

1101
00:57:00,804 --> 00:57:02,169
Woo woo!

1102
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,373
Aah aah!

1103
00:57:13,749 --> 00:57:16,650
Mama! Mama!

1104
00:57:16,752 --> 00:57:18,719
Shirley pushed me!

1105
00:57:20,255 --> 00:57:22,655
What's the matter
with that imp?

1106
00:57:22,757 --> 00:57:24,657
She's a very difficult child.

1107
00:57:24,759 --> 00:57:25,783
Difficult? Huh!

1108
00:57:25,894 --> 00:57:28,658
I can think of a better word.

1109
00:57:28,763 --> 00:57:31,731
Uncle Ned, I think you
should speak to Anita...

1110
00:57:31,832 --> 00:57:33,459
about the way
ZJoy treats Shirley.

1111
00:57:33,567 --> 00:57:35,831
No use talkin' to her.

1112
00:57:35,936 --> 00:57:38,734
I got somethin'
better up my sleeve.

1113
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:39,806
What?

1114
00:57:39,907 --> 00:57:40,771
You'll see.

1115
00:57:41,976 --> 00:57:43,704
Well, it's your move.

1116
00:57:45,278 --> 00:57:48,213
Uh... you only got one move.

1117
00:57:55,287 --> 00:57:56,686
Ha ha ha!

1118
00:57:56,788 --> 00:57:58,187
There you are!

1119
00:57:58,290 --> 00:57:59,689
Look at that!

1120
00:57:59,791 --> 00:58:01,156
You give up?

1121
00:58:04,263 --> 00:58:05,594
What was it you wanted?

1122
00:58:05,697 --> 00:58:07,028
I don't know whether
you know it or not...

1123
00:58:07,132 --> 00:58:08,359
but I'm Shirley's godfather.

1124
00:58:08,466 --> 00:58:09,899
- Oh, is that so?
- Really?

1125
00:58:10,001 --> 00:58:11,559
So naturally I want to do
the best I can for her.

1126
00:58:11,669 --> 00:58:13,136
Yes, of course.

1127
00:58:13,237 --> 00:58:15,398
When you wanted her to stay
here and live with you...

1128
00:58:15,506 --> 00:58:17,235
I thought it would be
a good idea.

1129
00:58:17,341 --> 00:58:18,706
I knew you'd be nice to her.

1130
00:58:18,809 --> 00:58:22,539
It isn't hard to be nice
to such a sweet child.

1131
00:58:22,646 --> 00:58:24,409
I'm glad you feel that way...

1132
00:58:24,514 --> 00:58:26,106
because Shirley means
more to me than anybody else...

1133
00:58:26,216 --> 00:58:27,478
in the world.

1134
00:58:27,584 --> 00:58:30,678
That's why I thought
I'd come and ask you-

1135
00:58:30,787 --> 00:58:32,186
Yes?

1136
00:58:32,289 --> 00:58:34,552
I want to take her
to live with me.

1137
00:58:34,657 --> 00:58:36,056
And I hope you'll
let me have her.

1138
00:58:36,158 --> 00:58:38,023
What's that?

1139
00:58:38,127 --> 00:58:39,719
Hey, what's all this?

1140
00:58:39,828 --> 00:58:40,726
Why-

1141
00:58:40,829 --> 00:58:42,592
Let me explain, dear.

1142
00:58:42,698 --> 00:58:44,393
You're that aviator
fellow, ain't ya?

1143
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,693
That's right.

1144
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,233
I don't like airplanes.

1145
00:58:47,335 --> 00:58:48,996
Well, I don't like wheelchairs.

1146
00:58:49,103 --> 00:58:50,934
Well, you stay
in the airplane business...

1147
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:53,269
and you'll wind up in one.

1148
00:58:54,475 --> 00:58:56,807
What's he doin' here?

1149
00:58:56,911 --> 00:58:58,400
Well... you see, Uncle Ned...

1150
00:58:58,512 --> 00:59:00,605
Mr. Merritt thinks
it's a good idea...

1151
00:59:00,714 --> 00:59:02,272
for Shirley to live with him.

1152
00:59:02,382 --> 00:59:05,579
What?! He wants to take
Shirley away from here?

1153
00:59:05,686 --> 00:59:07,415
Are you married?

1154
00:59:07,521 --> 00:59:09,079
No, I'm not.

1155
00:59:09,189 --> 00:59:11,088
How much do you make?

1156
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:12,589
Enough to support myself.

1157
00:59:12,692 --> 00:59:13,590
Where do you live?

1158
00:59:13,693 --> 00:59:14,591
At the airport.

1159
00:59:14,694 --> 00:59:15,752
Where do you eat?

1160
00:59:15,861 --> 00:59:17,021
In restaurants.

1161
00:59:17,129 --> 00:59:20,098
You've got a lot
of nerve, young fella.

1162
00:59:20,199 --> 00:59:22,099
How can you take care
of a child...

1163
00:59:22,201 --> 00:59:25,931
when you haven't got a home
or a wife or even a cook?

1164
00:59:26,037 --> 00:59:29,598
Well, maybe I've got
something else she needs.

1165
00:59:29,708 --> 00:59:32,108
- What?
- Love, that's what.

1166
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:33,609
Aw, fiddlesticks!

1167
00:59:33,712 --> 00:59:36,612
We all love her
here, don't we?!

1168
00:59:36,714 --> 00:59:38,113
Yes, Uncle Ned.

1169
00:59:38,215 --> 00:59:39,614
Well, you can't have her!

1170
00:59:39,717 --> 00:59:41,184
- Who says so?
- I say so.

1171
00:59:41,285 --> 00:59:43,082
I've got more right
to her than you have.

1172
00:59:43,187 --> 00:59:44,848
Aw, nonsense. You haven't
any right at all.

1173
00:59:44,955 --> 00:59:47,150
Well, we'll see about that!

1174
00:59:47,257 --> 00:59:49,122
Hey, young fella!

1175
00:59:49,225 --> 00:59:51,785
If you want to see about it...

1176
00:59:51,894 --> 00:59:53,623
you see my lawyers!

1177
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:55,061
Lawyers?

1178
00:59:55,164 --> 00:59:56,825
Lawyers?

1179
00:59:56,933 --> 00:59:59,163
That's what I said. Lawyers.

1180
00:59:59,269 --> 01:00:02,760
I'm taking legal steps
to adopt Shirley.

1181
01:00:04,506 --> 01:00:05,905
Good heavens!

1182
01:00:07,976 --> 01:00:09,671
So that's where he went yesterday.

1183
01:00:09,778 --> 01:00:11,075
You can't get away with this!

1184
01:00:11,179 --> 01:00:12,202
Oh, I can't, eh?

1185
01:00:12,313 --> 01:00:13,905
No! I'm gonna give you a fight!

1186
01:00:14,015 --> 01:00:16,506
I'll get lawyers myself!
We'll let the court decide!

1187
01:00:16,617 --> 01:00:18,141
Is that so?

1188
01:00:19,854 --> 01:00:21,754
You haven't got money
enough to fight me!

1189
01:00:21,856 --> 01:00:24,653
I'll get it. I don't care
if you've got $90 million!

1190
01:00:24,758 --> 01:00:26,817
You're not gonna take
Shirley away from me!

1191
01:00:26,926 --> 01:00:29,656
Ha! I've got the best
lawyers in the country!

1192
01:00:29,763 --> 01:00:31,731
Ha ha ha!

1193
01:00:31,831 --> 01:00:33,128
Loop!

1194
01:00:35,335 --> 01:00:38,201
You put one over
on me again, didn't you?

1195
01:00:38,304 --> 01:00:40,898
No. I didn't.
I didn't know about it.

1196
01:00:41,006 --> 01:00:42,837
You expect me
to believe that?

1197
01:00:42,941 --> 01:00:44,101
Yes.

1198
01:00:44,209 --> 01:00:45,335
OK.

1199
01:00:45,444 --> 01:00:48,845
Loop, from now on,
I'm on your side.

1200
01:00:48,947 --> 01:00:50,106
Why?

1201
01:00:50,214 --> 01:00:53,115
Because if Shirley
means so much to you...

1202
01:00:53,217 --> 01:00:55,117
then you're the one
who should have her.

1203
01:00:55,219 --> 01:00:58,120
For a child, love counts
more than anything.

1204
01:00:58,222 --> 01:01:00,747
ZJust for a child, huh?

1205
01:01:00,892 --> 01:01:02,358
For anyone.

1206
01:01:02,459 --> 01:01:05,360
I'm glad you found that out.

1207
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:23,310
There, now.

1208
01:01:24,914 --> 01:01:27,313
Pleasant dreams, dear,
and go right to sleep.

1209
01:01:27,415 --> 01:01:29,315
I don't want to go to sleep...

1210
01:01:29,417 --> 01:01:31,146
but I'll try.

1211
01:01:31,252 --> 01:01:33,015
That's a good little girl.

1212
01:01:35,323 --> 01:01:37,223
Good night, Shirley.

1213
01:01:37,325 --> 01:01:39,225
Good night, Mrs. Smythe.

1214
01:01:39,327 --> 01:01:40,554
And remember, Shirley...

1215
01:01:40,661 --> 01:01:42,629
I don't want to have to
speak to you again...

1216
01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:45,858
about having that awful
little dog in your bed.

1217
01:01:48,902 --> 01:01:50,301
It isn't healthful.

1218
01:01:50,404 --> 01:01:52,803
And besides,
I think the dog has fleas.

1219
01:01:52,905 --> 01:01:55,305
Oh, no. He hasn't got fleas.

1220
01:01:55,408 --> 01:01:58,241
He just scratches that way
because he's itchy.

1221
01:01:58,344 --> 01:02:01,905
Well, I don't want him
here in this bedroom.

1222
01:02:02,014 --> 01:02:03,413
Is that understood?

1223
01:02:03,516 --> 01:02:04,846
Yes, ma'am.

1224
01:02:07,953 --> 01:02:09,853
Good night,Joy, darling.

1225
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:16,688
Hey!

1226
01:02:16,795 --> 01:02:18,022
What?

1227
01:02:18,129 --> 01:02:20,427
Do you want to play burglars?

1228
01:02:20,531 --> 01:02:23,932
No. I want to go to sleep.

1229
01:02:27,905 --> 01:02:30,099
Come on, Rags.

1230
01:02:30,206 --> 01:02:34,802
Ooh! You've got that
awful dog in your bed...

1231
01:02:34,911 --> 01:02:37,311
after mommy
told you not to!

1232
01:02:37,414 --> 01:02:38,813
I'm gonna tell.

1233
01:02:38,915 --> 01:02:40,314
Mama!

1234
01:02:40,417 --> 01:02:42,816
You don't have to
yell for your mother...

1235
01:02:42,918 --> 01:02:45,113
and you don't have to
tell her, either...

1236
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:46,983
you old tattletale.

1237
01:02:47,089 --> 01:02:49,819
I'll take Rags downstairs.

1238
01:02:49,925 --> 01:02:52,519
Come on, Rags, good old dog.

1239
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:58,297
I thought about it
and thought about it...

1240
01:02:58,399 --> 01:03:00,526
and I'll be hanged-

1241
01:03:00,635 --> 01:03:02,830
Pardon me, dear-
if I know what to do.

1242
01:03:02,937 --> 01:03:05,838
The minute I heard him say
he'd seen his lawyers...

1243
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:08,169
I felt a cold chill
go down my back.

1244
01:03:08,275 --> 01:03:09,867
He may have
changed his will.

1245
01:03:09,976 --> 01:03:11,409
He may have left us
out of it entirely.

1246
01:03:11,511 --> 01:03:12,978
Oh, it's intolerable.

1247
01:03:13,079 --> 01:03:14,478
Yes, you're right, dear...

1248
01:03:14,581 --> 01:03:16,378
and all because
he took a fancy...

1249
01:03:16,483 --> 01:03:17,848
to a 5-year-old orphan.

1250
01:03:17,951 --> 01:03:19,247
There's been nothing
but trouble...

1251
01:03:19,351 --> 01:03:20,648
ever since that child
came into this house.

1252
01:03:20,753 --> 01:03:21,913
I wish we'd never seen her.

1253
01:03:22,021 --> 01:03:23,750
If you'd only taken my-

1254
01:03:23,856 --> 01:03:26,017
Now, don't tell me again
that it's all my fault...

1255
01:03:26,125 --> 01:03:27,990
for hiring the woman.

1256
01:03:28,093 --> 01:03:29,993
All right, dear.

1257
01:03:30,095 --> 01:03:31,925
Well, what are we
going to do about it?

1258
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:34,828
If we could find some way of
getting rid of the child.

1259
01:03:34,933 --> 01:03:36,901
Heaven knows
she's not wanted here.

1260
01:03:37,001 --> 01:03:39,731
Why don't you bribe
that aviator fellow...

1261
01:03:39,838 --> 01:03:42,329
to take her out of the state?

1262
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,339
Now, that's an idea.

1263
01:03:44,441 --> 01:03:45,999
But what would
Uncle Ned think?

1264
01:03:46,109 --> 01:03:47,701
Oh, I don't know.

1265
01:03:47,811 --> 01:03:51,212
I'm so sick of hearing that
child's name, I could scream.

1266
01:03:51,315 --> 01:03:53,476
She's practically
disrupted the family.

1267
01:03:53,584 --> 01:03:57,576
I know, dear. But we've got
to find some way out of it.

1268
01:04:33,888 --> 01:04:36,412
Say, what's
a three-letter word...

1269
01:04:36,523 --> 01:04:38,013
for Peer Gynt's mother?

1270
01:04:41,394 --> 01:04:43,794
What's the matter,
Loop? You low?

1271
01:04:43,897 --> 01:04:46,297
How could I
make some money?

1272
01:04:46,399 --> 01:04:47,797
What for?

1273
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:49,094
Well, I gotta hire some lawyers.

1274
01:04:49,201 --> 01:04:50,566
Why don't you marry the girl?

1275
01:04:50,669 --> 01:04:53,297
Cut out the wisecracks,
will you? I'm serious.

1276
01:04:53,405 --> 01:04:55,305
I don't know, Loop.
Flyers never have any money.

1277
01:04:55,407 --> 01:04:56,806
You know that.

1278
01:04:56,909 --> 01:04:58,899
Yeah, I know it.

1279
01:05:01,412 --> 01:05:03,312
Wow! What a night!

1280
01:05:04,415 --> 01:05:05,814
Heavy weather, huh?

1281
01:05:05,917 --> 01:05:07,316
Terrific.

1282
01:05:07,418 --> 01:05:09,318
I hear everything's on the ground.
Nothing moving.

1283
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:12,320
That's right.
Zero zero all along the line.

1284
01:05:12,422 --> 01:05:13,821
Boy, oh, boy.

1285
01:05:18,695 --> 01:05:20,890
Hello, everybody.

1286
01:05:23,033 --> 01:05:24,465
Shirley!

1287
01:05:25,534 --> 01:05:26,933
What's happened?

1288
01:05:27,036 --> 01:05:28,628
Shirley,
what are you doing out...

1289
01:05:28,737 --> 01:05:31,467
on a night like this?
Why, you're soakin' wet.

1290
01:05:31,574 --> 01:05:34,270
Come on, now. You gotta get
those clothes off and dried out.

1291
01:05:34,376 --> 01:05:35,274
Hello.

1292
01:05:35,377 --> 01:05:36,274
Hello, honey.

1293
01:05:36,377 --> 01:05:37,401
Hello, Shirley.

1294
01:05:40,882 --> 01:05:42,144
Are you all dressed?

1295
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:43,274
Yes.

1296
01:05:43,384 --> 01:05:44,874
Did you dry yourself off good?

1297
01:05:44,986 --> 01:05:46,851
- I did.
- OK.

1298
01:05:52,392 --> 01:05:53,791
Ha ha ha!

1299
01:05:53,894 --> 01:05:55,794
You sure look swell.

1300
01:05:55,896 --> 01:05:57,830
They fit you fine.

1301
01:05:58,899 --> 01:06:00,423
Now, then...

1302
01:06:00,534 --> 01:06:02,296
what's the big idea?

1303
01:06:02,401 --> 01:06:05,837
I don't want to live with
the Smythes anymore, Loop.

1304
01:06:05,938 --> 01:06:07,803
I want to stay with you.

1305
01:06:07,907 --> 01:06:10,808
I want you to stay
with me, Shirley.

1306
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:12,810
And I'm gonna try
and fix it so you can.

1307
01:06:12,912 --> 01:06:15,311
Oh, goody!

1308
01:06:15,413 --> 01:06:17,313
Now, then...
off you go to sleep...

1309
01:06:17,415 --> 01:06:19,280
and we'll talk
everything over tomorrow.

1310
01:06:19,384 --> 01:06:21,318
You're not mad at me
for coming here...

1311
01:06:21,419 --> 01:06:23,011
are you, Loop?

1312
01:06:23,121 --> 01:06:26,283
Yes, I am very, very mad.

1313
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:27,618
Ha ha ha!

1314
01:06:27,725 --> 01:06:29,022
Come on.

1315
01:06:29,126 --> 01:06:30,559
Ha ha ha!

1316
01:06:41,904 --> 01:06:43,303
? Ohhh?

1317
01:06:43,406 --> 01:06:45,806
? He flies
through the air?

1318
01:06:45,908 --> 01:06:47,500
? With the greatest
of ease?

1319
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:49,669
? This daring young man?

1320
01:06:49,779 --> 01:06:52,178
? On his flying trapeze?

1321
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:54,180
? Well, his movements
were graceful?

1322
01:06:54,282 --> 01:06:56,182
? The girls he would please?

1323
01:06:56,284 --> 01:06:57,512
? This daring young man?

1324
01:06:57,619 --> 01:07:00,315
? On his flying trapeze?

1325
01:07:00,422 --> 01:07:01,821
Well, good morning, Anita.

1326
01:07:01,923 --> 01:07:03,185
Good morning, Uncle Ned.

1327
01:07:03,291 --> 01:07:04,314
Good morning,John.

1328
01:07:04,425 --> 01:07:05,414
Good morning, Uncle Ned.

1329
01:07:05,526 --> 01:07:07,323
Beautiful morning, isn't it?

1330
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:12,331
Do you feel all right, Uncle Ned?

1331
01:07:12,433 --> 01:07:15,334
My boy, I never felt
better in my life.

1332
01:07:19,339 --> 01:07:20,738
Tony!

1333
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:23,240
I sent him out for
some breakfast, Loop.

1334
01:07:23,343 --> 01:07:24,742
What's the matter?
Aren't you workin'?

1335
01:07:24,844 --> 01:07:26,744
Not today. I'm no hero.

1336
01:07:26,846 --> 01:07:29,245
Aw, it's not that tough, is it?

1337
01:07:29,348 --> 01:07:31,873
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
here's news of national import.</i>

1338
01:07:31,984 --> 01:07:33,542
<i>Two mail planes
are reported missing...</i>

1339
01:07:33,652 --> 01:07:35,950
<i>in the worst storm the West
has known in years.</i>

1340
01:07:36,055 --> 01:07:38,615
<i>A blizzard is raging
over the Rockies...</i>

1341
01:07:38,724 --> 01:07:40,783
<i>which has completely disrupted
rail and air traffic.</i>

1342
01:07:40,893 --> 01:07:42,883
<i>All transcontinental
passenger planes...</i>

1343
01:07:42,994 --> 01:07:45,428
<i>have been ordered grounded
until the weather breaks.</i>

1344
01:07:45,530 --> 01:07:47,794
<i>That's 30 for this morning.
This is Sam Hayes speaking.</i>

1345
01:07:47,899 --> 01:07:49,696
<i>I'll see you tonight
at 10.00. Good day, all.</i>

1346
01:07:49,801 --> 01:07:51,769
I'm ready for breakfast now, Loop.

1347
01:07:51,869 --> 01:07:54,428
I was gonna have
some chow brought down...

1348
01:07:54,538 --> 01:07:56,563
but I guess we'll
have to go and get it.

1349
01:07:56,673 --> 01:07:59,073
And then, young lady,
you're going to have to go home.

1350
01:07:59,176 --> 01:08:01,770
Oh, Loop.
Why can't I stay here?

1351
01:08:01,878 --> 01:08:04,813
Can't you be a soldier and
stick it out for a little while?

1352
01:08:04,915 --> 01:08:06,905
I don't want to.

1353
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:08,916
You don't want to live
in a swell house...

1354
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:12,249
go to a nice school,
and be educated and refined?

1355
01:08:12,354 --> 01:08:14,117
I don't want to be refined.

1356
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:15,986
I want to be like you.

1357
01:08:17,893 --> 01:08:20,759
All right.
Let's eat and talk it over.

1358
01:08:20,862 --> 01:08:22,227
Now, come on. Bundle up warm.

1359
01:08:24,866 --> 01:08:27,767
Well, children,
I want you to know...

1360
01:08:27,869 --> 01:08:30,030
that I'm about
to change my will.

1361
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:34,264
I'm adopting Shirley...

1362
01:08:34,374 --> 01:08:36,672
and I'm setting aside
a trust fund for her.

1363
01:08:36,777 --> 01:08:37,937
What?

1364
01:08:38,045 --> 01:08:40,275
You two have
nothing to worry about...

1365
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:42,905
so long as you
behave yourselves.

1366
01:08:44,383 --> 01:08:45,509
Mama!

1367
01:08:45,618 --> 01:08:46,642
Mama!

1368
01:08:46,753 --> 01:08:47,742
Mama!

1369
01:08:47,854 --> 01:08:49,287
Mama! Mama!

1370
01:08:49,388 --> 01:08:51,413
- Shirley's gone!
- What?

1371
01:08:51,524 --> 01:08:53,822
Yeah! She didn't sleep
in her bed all night...

1372
01:08:53,926 --> 01:08:57,190
'cause I woke up and looked.
She must've run away!

1373
01:08:57,295 --> 01:08:59,786
She wouldn't have run away
without some reason!

1374
01:08:59,898 --> 01:09:01,490
Did you have anything
to do with this?

1375
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,261
Why, of course not, Uncle Ned.

1376
01:09:03,368 --> 01:09:05,461
She's gone to that aviator fella!

1377
01:09:05,570 --> 01:09:08,470
Get police! Get detectives!
Get the army!

1378
01:09:08,572 --> 01:09:10,472
But go to that airport
and bring her home!

1379
01:09:10,574 --> 01:09:11,871
Yes, Uncle Ned.

1380
01:09:11,976 --> 01:09:13,841
There'd better be some
action around here now...

1381
01:09:13,944 --> 01:09:15,172
I'll tell you that!

1382
01:09:25,288 --> 01:09:26,721
You see, honey?

1383
01:09:26,823 --> 01:09:29,223
Man's just learning what
the birds knew all the time.

1384
01:09:29,325 --> 01:09:30,690
What?

1385
01:09:30,794 --> 01:09:34,194
You never saw birds fly
in bad weather, did you?

1386
01:09:34,296 --> 01:09:36,230
They have
too much sense for that.

1387
01:09:38,801 --> 01:09:42,498
Listen. Am I working for you,
or you working for me?

1388
01:09:42,604 --> 01:09:43,662
I'm workin' for you.

1389
01:09:43,772 --> 01:09:44,966
Well, then you listen to me.

1390
01:09:45,073 --> 01:09:46,562
This has gotta be
in New York tomorrow.

1391
01:09:46,674 --> 01:09:48,665
It means a lot of money to me.
You're gonna fly it there.

1392
01:09:48,776 --> 01:09:49,834
Not me.

1393
01:09:49,944 --> 01:09:51,343
What do you mean, not you?

1394
01:09:51,445 --> 01:09:53,037
I mean the weather's too bad.

1395
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:54,637
There won't be one ship
take off from here today.

1396
01:09:54,749 --> 01:09:56,376
- It's too dangerous.
- You don't understand.

1397
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:58,417
This has got to be
in New York tomorrow.

1398
01:09:58,518 --> 01:09:59,849
That's all I know.

1399
01:09:59,953 --> 01:10:01,784
Well, I'm sorry, it can't be done.

1400
01:10:01,888 --> 01:10:03,583
I've got a wife and two children...

1401
01:10:03,690 --> 01:10:05,385
and they mean more
to me than this job.

1402
01:10:05,492 --> 01:10:07,016
You mean I gotta
get someone else?

1403
01:10:07,127 --> 01:10:09,220
You sure do.

1404
01:10:09,329 --> 01:10:11,296
All right. You're through.

1405
01:10:11,397 --> 01:10:13,797
I'd give $1,000 for this flight.

1406
01:10:13,899 --> 01:10:16,265
There must be someone around
that wants that kind of money.

1407
01:10:16,368 --> 01:10:17,596
You won't get anyone
to fly today.

1408
01:10:17,703 --> 01:10:20,763
Well, that's my worry.
I'll find somebody.

1409
01:10:21,974 --> 01:10:23,440
Oh, my! Come on!

1410
01:10:23,541 --> 01:10:24,940
Come on, Rags.

1411
01:10:30,548 --> 01:10:31,947
Who's Loop Merritt?

1412
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:33,449
I am.

1413
01:10:34,586 --> 01:10:37,816
You fly to New York for me?

1414
01:10:37,921 --> 01:10:39,479
Not today.

1415
01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:43,924
They told me you were a
flyer with plenty of nerve.

1416
01:10:44,027 --> 01:10:46,222
Nerve is one thing,
and being crazy is another.

1417
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:48,320
Anybody who takes a ship
up today is crazy.

1418
01:10:48,431 --> 01:10:51,366
There's $1,000 in it for you.

1419
01:10:53,436 --> 01:10:55,836
I could use 1,000, all right.

1420
01:10:55,938 --> 01:10:57,838
Mister, you got a bet.

1421
01:10:57,940 --> 01:11:00,170
This has to be delivered in
New York tomorrow morning.

1422
01:11:00,276 --> 01:11:01,936
Leave the check in the office
with Major Moseley.

1423
01:11:02,043 --> 01:11:03,408
I'll do that right now...

1424
01:11:03,511 --> 01:11:05,342
and I'll meet you
in my hangar in 10 minutes.

1425
01:11:07,449 --> 01:11:09,815
You're not really gonna
fly today, are you, Loop?

1426
01:11:09,918 --> 01:11:11,249
I sure am.

1427
01:11:11,353 --> 01:11:13,183
Don't be crazy.
You'll kill yourself!.

1428
01:11:13,287 --> 01:11:14,584
Didn't you ever
need money so badly...

1429
01:11:14,688 --> 01:11:15,950
you were willing
to risk your life for it?

1430
01:11:16,056 --> 01:11:17,614
Sure, but on a day like-

1431
01:11:17,725 --> 01:11:19,488
I know, but I need $1,000,
and I need it for a good reason.

1432
01:11:19,593 --> 01:11:20,821
No one should fly
in this weather.

1433
01:11:20,928 --> 01:11:22,759
I fly better
in weather like this.

1434
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:31,901
Eddie, come here.

1435
01:11:35,408 --> 01:11:37,342
Take Shirley home, will you?

1436
01:11:37,443 --> 01:11:39,535
Sure, Loop.

1437
01:11:39,645 --> 01:11:41,044
So long, baby.

1438
01:11:41,146 --> 01:11:42,545
Be a nice fella
and wait till I get back.

1439
01:11:42,648 --> 01:11:44,343
I'll wait right here for you.

1440
01:11:44,449 --> 01:11:45,973
Oh, no. You have to go home.

1441
01:11:46,084 --> 01:11:49,281
No. I'm never going back there.

1442
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:52,652
Aw, Shirley. I'm making
this flight to get money...

1443
01:11:52,757 --> 01:11:55,225
so that I can take you
and keep you with me always.

1444
01:11:55,326 --> 01:11:57,453
But for now, you'll have to
go back to the Smythes'.

1445
01:11:57,561 --> 01:12:00,359
Won't you do that for me?

1446
01:12:00,464 --> 01:12:02,364
All right, Loop...

1447
01:12:02,466 --> 01:12:04,194
but hurry back.

1448
01:12:17,479 --> 01:12:19,310
You wait in here
out of the wind, honey.

1449
01:12:19,415 --> 01:12:20,746
I'll be right back.

1450
01:12:41,702 --> 01:12:44,102
So long, Loop. Lots of luck.

1451
01:12:44,204 --> 01:12:46,035
Why don't you call it off, Loop?

1452
01:12:46,139 --> 01:12:47,231
Nothin' doin'.

1453
01:12:47,341 --> 01:12:49,502
Hey,just a minute!
Where's Shirley?

1454
01:12:49,609 --> 01:12:51,509
Don't tell me you're worried.

1455
01:12:51,611 --> 01:12:54,044
Never mind the funny stuff.
If you've got that kid...

1456
01:12:54,146 --> 01:12:55,613
you're in a tough spot.

1457
01:12:55,715 --> 01:12:58,343
Well, wise guy, I haven't got her.
I sent her home.

1458
01:12:58,451 --> 01:12:59,941
She'll be at your house
before you get there.

1459
01:13:00,052 --> 01:13:01,019
You sent her home?

1460
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,519
Yes, I sent her home!

1461
01:13:02,621 --> 01:13:04,418
You know I could have you
arrested for kidnapping.

1462
01:13:04,523 --> 01:13:05,853
We'll take that up
at the next meeting.

1463
01:13:05,957 --> 01:13:06,946
So long, fellas.

1464
01:13:49,398 --> 01:13:51,798
- Well, where is she?
- Isn't she here?

1465
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:53,800
- She is not.
- She ought to be.

1466
01:13:53,902 --> 01:13:55,300
Sure, she should be,
but she isn't.

1467
01:13:55,403 --> 01:13:56,461
Are you a detective?

1468
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:57,628
Yes, sir.

1469
01:13:57,738 --> 01:13:58,762
Well, I'm not, but if I was one...

1470
01:13:58,873 --> 01:13:59,965
I'd figure out where she is.

1471
01:14:00,074 --> 01:14:00,972
Now, Mr. Smythe-

1472
01:14:01,075 --> 01:14:01,973
Smith's my name!

1473
01:14:02,076 --> 01:14:03,100
You know what I think?

1474
01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:04,677
I didn't know you could think!

1475
01:14:04,779 --> 01:14:06,406
I think that aviator
took her with him.

1476
01:14:06,514 --> 01:14:07,571
He was going on a flight
when we got there.

1477
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:08,669
Say, that's right!

1478
01:14:08,782 --> 01:14:10,272
You say he was goin' away?

1479
01:14:10,383 --> 01:14:11,611
- Yes.
- Sure, he's got her!

1480
01:14:11,718 --> 01:14:13,686
He's taken her with him!

1481
01:14:13,787 --> 01:14:15,152
Call the police!
Call my lawyers!

1482
01:14:15,255 --> 01:14:16,984
Now, take it easy, Uncle Ned.

1483
01:14:17,090 --> 01:14:18,114
Ah, get out.

1484
01:14:18,224 --> 01:14:20,282
Hurry, man! Hurry!

1485
01:14:20,392 --> 01:14:21,859
Have them in a moment,
Mr. Smith.

1486
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:23,757
Hello. This is Hall speaking.

1487
01:14:23,862 --> 01:14:24,794
I want to report a kidnapping.

1488
01:14:24,897 --> 01:14:26,797
I'll spend $10,000-

1489
01:14:26,899 --> 01:14:30,596
Anything to get her
back safe and sound.

1490
01:14:34,906 --> 01:14:37,807
<i>Burbank, Burbank. Zero zero.</i>

1491
01:14:37,909 --> 01:14:42,312
<i>Dense fog. Zero.

1492
01:14:42,413 --> 01:14:44,937

01:14:45,048 --> 01:14:46,640
<i>Barometer 29.80.</i>

1494
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:48,115
<i>Winds west 3.</i>

1495
01:14:50,921 --> 01:14:53,822
<i>All airports have been asked

1496
01:14:53,924 --> 01:14:57,359
<i>if plane NC13843 lands.</i>

1497
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:59,485
<i>The pilot,James Merritt...</i>

1498
01:14:59,595 --> 01:15:01,790
<i>is suspected ofkidnapping
Shirley Blake...</i>

1499
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:03,330
<i>5 years old.</i>

1500
01:15:03,432 --> 01:15:05,332
Ha! Ha ha!

1501
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:07,459
Ha ha ha ha!

1502
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:21,281
Shirley! Come here.

1503
01:15:26,353 --> 01:15:28,753
How did you get in here?

1504
01:15:28,856 --> 01:15:31,791
I got in where the baggage goes.

1505
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:35,259
Don't be mad, Loop.

1506
01:15:35,361 --> 01:15:36,919
This is the first time in my life...

1507
01:15:37,029 --> 01:15:38,621
I ever felt like spanking you.

1508
01:15:38,731 --> 01:15:41,165
Didn't you tell me
to send you this ring...

1509
01:15:41,267 --> 01:15:42,700
if I wanted you
to come get me?

1510
01:15:42,802 --> 01:15:43,894
That's right.

1511
01:15:44,003 --> 01:15:45,493
Well, I was going to send it...

1512
01:15:45,605 --> 01:15:48,835
but I couldn't get it off,
so I brought it myself. See?

1513
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:52,307
You certainly picked
a fine time to do it.

1514
01:15:57,649 --> 01:15:59,809
Now, what's the idea?

1515
01:16:02,953 --> 01:16:05,080
I want to be with you, Loop.

1516
01:16:05,189 --> 01:16:07,248
<i>All airport offiicials
have been asked...</i>

1517
01:16:07,358 --> 01:16:11,818
<i>to report the arrival
of plane NC13843.</i>

1518
01:16:13,963 --> 01:16:16,363
You know, we're really in trouble.

1519
01:16:16,466 --> 01:16:19,765
Loop, you're not awful
mad at me, are you?

1520
01:16:19,869 --> 01:16:22,804
Yes, I'm very mad at you.

1521
01:16:24,873 --> 01:16:27,808
Well, I guess I won't be very long.

1522
01:16:36,885 --> 01:16:38,112
That's right. But be sure...

1523
01:16:38,219 --> 01:16:40,449
and keep me posted
if anything happens.

1524
01:16:40,555 --> 01:16:41,783
Well?

1525
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:43,823
There isn't any news.

1526
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:55,266
I blame you two for this.

1527
01:16:55,368 --> 01:16:57,802
If you hadn't been so selfish...

1528
01:16:57,904 --> 01:17:00,805
if you'd just been
a little kinder...

1529
01:17:00,907 --> 01:17:03,397
that child would
never have left here.

1530
01:17:03,509 --> 01:17:06,774
You people have everything
to make life worthwhile-

1531
01:17:06,879 --> 01:17:09,780
youth and health and money.

1532
01:17:09,882 --> 01:17:12,783
And yet you were too mean
and too narrow to share it...

1533
01:17:12,885 --> 01:17:14,977
with a little child
who had nothing...

1534
01:17:15,086 --> 01:17:19,216
but who had more
than you'll ever have.

1535
01:17:19,324 --> 01:17:22,725
Well, if anything
happens to her...

1536
01:17:22,827 --> 01:17:26,194
I'm through with you
for good and all.

1537
01:17:38,842 --> 01:17:41,241
Is it always bumpy like this?

1538
01:17:41,344 --> 01:17:44,245
It isn't bumpy till you
hit your head on the top.

1539
01:17:44,347 --> 01:17:46,975
Say, reach in my pocket
and get a stick of gum.

1540
01:17:48,351 --> 01:17:50,251
Isn't this great?

1541
01:17:50,353 --> 01:17:51,752
Uh-huh.

1542
01:17:51,853 --> 01:17:53,218
Give me half.

1543
01:17:56,358 --> 01:17:59,259
Say, what was that
"Lollipop" song?

1544
01:17:59,361 --> 01:18:01,420
Go ahead and sing it.

1545
01:18:01,529 --> 01:18:04,759
<i>? On the good ship Lollipop?</i>

1546
01:18:04,865 --> 01:18:06,765
? It's a sweet trip...?

1547
01:18:08,869 --> 01:18:10,268
?... Bonbons play?

1548
01:18:10,371 --> 01:18:12,839
? On the sunny beach of Peppermint Bay?

1549
01:18:14,275 --> 01:18:16,266
NC13843 calling.

1550
01:18:16,377 --> 01:18:18,674
NC13843 abandoning ship.

1551
01:18:18,778 --> 01:18:20,678
Broken gas line.

1552
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:23,180
Approximate position-
Can you hear me?

1553
01:18:23,283 --> 01:18:24,682
It's dead.

1554
01:18:24,784 --> 01:18:26,684
What's the matter, Loop?

1555
01:18:26,786 --> 01:18:28,686
Do you love me?

1556
01:18:28,788 --> 01:18:30,186
Of course, Loop.

1557
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:32,189
How much?

1558
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:34,225
Oh, you can hug me
tighter than that...

1559
01:18:34,326 --> 01:18:35,759
'cause we're bailin' out.

1560
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:39,763
Hold tight.

1561
01:19:34,848 --> 01:19:36,748
Are you all right, honey?

1562
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:38,249
Sure!

1563
01:19:38,352 --> 01:19:40,411
Let's do it again.

1564
01:19:54,867 --> 01:19:56,766
And in conclusion, your honor...

1565
01:19:56,868 --> 01:19:59,393
my client feels that he
is the best qualified...

1566
01:19:59,504 --> 01:20:01,972
and most fit person to have
the custody of this child.

1567
01:20:02,073 --> 01:20:03,472
He therefore prays...

1568
01:20:03,575 --> 01:20:05,509
that you grant him
the right of adoption.

1569
01:20:07,645 --> 01:20:10,374
ZJames Merritt.

1570
01:20:13,217 --> 01:20:14,275
Yes, your honor?

1571
01:20:14,385 --> 01:20:16,114
Aren't you represented by counsel?

1572
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:17,881
No, sir.

1573
01:20:17,988 --> 01:20:19,785
Well, you've heard all
about the advantages...

1574
01:20:19,890 --> 01:20:21,584
Mr. Smith can give Shirley.

1575
01:20:21,691 --> 01:20:23,591
What have you to offer?

1576
01:20:23,693 --> 01:20:25,126
Not very much.

1577
01:20:25,228 --> 01:20:28,391
I haven't a lot of money,
and I haven't a fine home.

1578
01:20:28,498 --> 01:20:31,433
But I love Shirley,
and I know she loves me.

1579
01:20:31,534 --> 01:20:34,297
I'd do anything
in the world for her.

1580
01:20:37,038 --> 01:20:39,973
Judge: Come on up here
by me, Shirley.

1581
01:20:50,551 --> 01:20:52,985
Up she goes. Yeah.

1582
01:20:55,055 --> 01:20:56,955
Well, looks as though you...

1583
01:20:57,057 --> 01:20:59,456
are a very popular young woman.

1584
01:20:59,559 --> 01:21:03,962
Now, it's my duty to decide
who is going to adopt you...

1585
01:21:04,063 --> 01:21:05,997
but I think you should have
something to say about it...

1586
01:21:06,099 --> 01:21:07,123
don't you?

1587
01:21:07,233 --> 01:21:08,825
Yes, I do.

1588
01:21:08,935 --> 01:21:12,461
Now, uh... which of these people
would you like to live with?

1589
01:21:12,571 --> 01:21:15,972
I'd like to live with him.

1590
01:21:20,212 --> 01:21:22,271
And I'd like to live with him, too.

1591
01:21:27,118 --> 01:21:28,745
And her, too.

1592
01:21:30,588 --> 01:21:32,988
Well, it seems to me that this case...

1593
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:35,388
can be settled
without attorneys.

1594
01:21:35,493 --> 01:21:38,461
Will all the lawyers
in the courtroom please leave?

1595
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:01,647
Now, suppose we adjourn
to my chambers.

1596
01:22:01,749 --> 01:22:03,182
Come on, dear.

1597
01:22:06,087 --> 01:22:07,987
Oh, not you, Mr. Merritt...

1598
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:10,489
nor you, Mr. and Mrs. Smythe.

1599
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:13,459
I just want to talk to Mr. Smith
and the young lady.

1600
01:22:18,765 --> 01:22:21,097
Mama, do we have to have...

1601
01:22:21,201 --> 01:22:24,102
that old Shirley
living with us again?

1602
01:22:24,204 --> 01:22:25,603
Darling, please, be quiet.

1603
01:22:25,706 --> 01:22:27,070
But, mama, do we?

1604
01:22:27,173 --> 01:22:28,902
Shh! Shh!

1605
01:22:39,017 --> 01:22:40,678
Ha ha ha!

1606
01:22:40,785 --> 01:22:42,912
Ha ha ha!

1607
01:22:44,990 --> 01:22:46,218
Well, Mr. Merritt...

1608
01:22:46,324 --> 01:22:47,882
I've been making
some inquiries...

1609
01:22:47,993 --> 01:22:49,893
and I'm not so sure-

1610
01:22:49,995 --> 01:22:52,428
Would you please
step in here?

1611
01:23:10,013 --> 01:23:13,107
You told Shirley if
she was ever in trouble...

1612
01:23:13,216 --> 01:23:15,116
to send you this ring.

1613
01:23:15,218 --> 01:23:17,583
Well, I want to see
if it's really a magic ring...

1614
01:23:17,686 --> 01:23:20,883
because I'm in trouble.

1615
01:23:20,989 --> 01:23:23,389
You want Shirley...
and I want Shirley.

1616
01:23:23,492 --> 01:23:25,892
If you think hard for a minute...

1617
01:23:25,994 --> 01:23:27,427
can't you figure a way out?

1618
01:23:27,529 --> 01:23:30,224
I don't get you at all.

1619
01:23:31,866 --> 01:23:34,892
Oh, dear. Do I have to propose?

1620
01:23:35,002 --> 01:23:36,765
Well, I did the last time.

1621
01:23:36,871 --> 01:23:38,395
Oh, Loop.

1622
01:23:40,541 --> 01:23:43,941
No. You don't have to propose.

1623
01:23:44,044 --> 01:23:46,945
Maybe all this happened
for a good reason.

1624
01:23:47,047 --> 01:23:48,912
And this time, it'll last forever.

1625
01:23:57,556 --> 01:23:59,956
Well, Uncle Ned, who got Shirley?

1626
01:24:00,059 --> 01:24:01,959
We did.

1627
01:24:02,061 --> 01:24:04,586
Come up and see us sometime.

1628
01:24:08,933 --> 01:24:11,868
Oh, Papa, now we don't have to...

1629
01:24:11,970 --> 01:24:14,336
be nice to Uncle Ned anymore!
