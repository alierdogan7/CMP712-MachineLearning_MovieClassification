1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,132
<i>So here's what you missed on Glee.</i>

2
00:00:01,166 --> 00:00:03,134
<i>Sue sprung a surprise invitational</i>

3
00:00:03,168 --> 00:00:05,136
<i>on the New Directions and the
Warblers and Vocal Adrenaline,</i>

4
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,138
<i>and Will's team got to go
first and they were amazing.</i>

5
00:00:07,172 --> 00:00:09,140
<i>Kind of hard to see how they could lose.</i>

6
00:00:09,174 --> 00:00:11,142
<i>Sue's a secret Klainer
and obsessed with getting.</i>

7
00:00:11,176 --> 00:00:13,144
<i>Kurt and Blaine back together,
except Blaine's dating Karofsky</i>

8
00:00:13,178 --> 00:00:16,147
<i>and Kurt went on a date with
a guy named Walter in his 50s.</i>

9
00:00:16,181 --> 00:00:18,149
How old are you
exactly?

10
00:00:18,183 --> 00:00:20,151
<i>Sue hypnotized Sam to
mess with Will and Rachel.</i>

11
00:00:20,185 --> 00:00:22,185
Oh, my God, I'm totally hypnotized.

12
00:00:22,187 --> 00:00:24,188
<i>And now Will and Rachel are, like,</i>

13
00:00:24,223 --> 00:00:26,190
<i>actual show choir enemies.</i>

14
00:00:26,224 --> 00:00:28,184
<i>And that's what you missed on Glee.</i>

15
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,802
Vocal Adrenaline, everybody.

16
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:39,271
Absolutely breathtaking, huh?

17
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:41,907
I am here to inform all three teams

18
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:44,142
that I, Sue Sylvester, will be judging

19
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:47,245
this year's McKinley High
Show Choir Invitational.

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,613
What? That's crazy.

21
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:49,748
I run this school now.

22
00:00:49,782 --> 00:00:52,251
My school, my rules.

23
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,252
And speaking of rules,
I would like to outline

24
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:56,188
the rules for this year's invitational.

25
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,522
Wait, Sue, you can't change the rules

26
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,258
after one team has already performed.

27
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:00,792
Sure I can. Rule number one:

28
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,829
this year's theme is "old school."

29
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:06,498
there are no more rules.

30
00:01:06,532 --> 00:01:09,301
The Dalton Academy Warblers
will perform tomorrow,

31
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:12,271
and The New Directions will
perform the following day.

32
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,373
Wait, this is a three-day competition?

33
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,974
Where will we sleep?

34
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,043
I imagine you two will
sleep inside one another.

35
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:20,312
I've chosen to extend the invitational

36
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:22,346
in an effort to give the
New Directions enough time

37
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:25,017
to come up with the requisite 12 members,

38
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:28,020
which is the only show
choir rule anyone remembers

39
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:30,656
and yet every year is surprised by.

40
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,858
This is insane. We should all boycott.

41
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:35,127
Oh, no, no, no, Porcelain.
No, this is happening.

42
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:38,664
Each team will perform
at this invitational.

43
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,999
Even if one show choir's co-director is

44
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:44,002
kidnapped and held against his will,

45
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:47,706
causing him to miss the performance.

46
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:57,015
- Mr. Schuester!
- Yes?

47
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,017
We had a deal that you
would have Vocal Adrenaline

48
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,253
perform at a subpar level, and
you dishonored that agreement.

49
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,487
I never agreed to that.

50
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:03,689
I guess you'll just have

51
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,490
- to beat us on your own
terms. - You know what?

52
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:08,227
We're just gonna find a
way to win on our own terms.

53
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,095
Which is exactly what you just said.

54
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,164
Wow, we have our work cut out for us.

55
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,732
Vocal Adrenaline was amazing.

56
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,601
We have two days. We have
to recruit more members

57
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,169
and put together some sort of performance

58
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:19,338
that doesn't totally
humiliate us as a team.

59
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,273
Uh, I have an idea that
you are not gonna like,

60
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,841
but you need to consider.

61
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,710
We need to recruit Kitty.

62
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,011
- No, Kurt! No!
- Rachel, come on.

63
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:27,913
She's talented. She's a senior.

64
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:29,948
- Kurt, she hates me.
- You don't know that.

65
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,683
No, I do. All of those kids do, okay?

66
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,385
I was so intent on being a Broadway star

67
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,854
that I never even learned her
name, or any of their names.

68
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,456
There was... there was Puck's brother

69
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,691
and-and then there was
cross-dressing Mercedes

70
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:42,261
and the one with the fat
mom and whatever... Raider.

71
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,363
- Ryder.
- See? I was awful to them.

72
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,131
Well, I'm sorry, Rachel.
We don't have a choice.

73
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,533
We need to get Kitty.

74
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:48,600
Don't worry. I'm gonna help you.

75
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:49,635
I'll be right by your side

76
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,670
every step of the way.

77
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:56,202

78
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:57,976
You see that corner booth over there?

79
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,779
Back in the '90s, a lady gave birth

80
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:02,915
on that very table.

81
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,384
I saw the whole damn thing.
She was just finishing up...

82
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,820
<i>So I don't totally
know what's going on here.</i>

83
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,988
<i>This is the second time
Walter and I have gone out.</i>

84
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,490
<i>He's really funny and smart</i>

85
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,058
<i>and very good looking for an older guy.</i>

86
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:15,994
<i>But I can't tell if he
thinks this is a date or</i>

87
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,129
<i>if we're just friends.</i>

88
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:18,664
<i>Okay, Kurt,</i>

89
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,766
<i>whatever you do, do not
just come out and ask him.</i>

90
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,468
So what's going on here?

91
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,270
<i>Would you consider this a date? Damn it!</i>

92
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,672
Do you want it to be a date?

93
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,641
Look, um, I had a lot of fun
the last time that we hung out,

94
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,510
so... yes.

95
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,612
To our second date.

96
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:35,647
To our second date.

97
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,851
Well, good evening, gentlemen.

98
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,687
My name is Susan and I will
be taking care of you tonight.

99
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,422
Shall we start with something to drink?

100
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:46,925
Perhaps a Shirley Temple
in a sippy cup for sonny?

101
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,094
Or how about a chalky can of Ensure,

102
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:52,931
enriched with calcium to
fortify those brittle bones?

103
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,668
Now, is your great-grand uncle

104
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:59,171
in charge of his faculties or
are you going to be feeding him?

105
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,440
Because I'll just need
to alert the bus staff

106
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,475
that I might be changing an adult diaper.

107
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,445
Excuse me. I can hear
everything you're saying.

108
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,447
Well, then allow me to personally

109
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,950
thank you for being part
of the greatest generation.

110
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,118
All right.

111
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:15,454
Here's a children's menu for baby.

112
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,190
And the early bird menu for old timers.

113
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,960
And, yes, of course, we
have liver and onions.

114
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,529
I am so, so sorry.

115
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:26,799
Why? I think this woman is hilarious.

116
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,568
And you have to understand,
when you're as handsome as I am,

117
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,803
very little bothers you.

118
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,405
And by the way, ma'am,

119
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,374
just how old are you?

120
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,344
Thirty-four.

121
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,246
Ah.

122
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,382
I will be right back with
your hemorrhoid pillow.

123
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,119
To our second date.

124
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:52,424
I'm gonna show you something.

125
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:05,871
Oh, Becky, this is Klaine.

126
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,907
And theirs is a love for the ages.

127
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:10,276
But, Coach,

128
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,444
they're barely looking at each other.

129
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,914
Well, that's because their
chemistry is so intense, Becky,

130
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:17,516
if they were actually
to make eye contact...

131
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,585
Oh, my... the emotion would be such

132
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,387
they'd have to disappear
behind the nearest Dumpster

133
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,622
and just hump, hump, hump, hump, hump.

134
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,459
Where did you get all these video clips?

135
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,427
I have cameras everywhere, Becky.

136
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:31,096
But is this, like, a dream sequence?

137
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,798
How could you film that?

138
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,301
Okay, Becky, shut up.
You're ruining this, honey.

139
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,304
But it looks like they
don't even like each other.

140
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,772
Sweet, simple, Becky,

141
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,741
you have so much to learn about love.

142
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,276
What are you talking about?

143
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,378
I have a hot boyfriend.

144
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:48,147
Look at them, Becky.

145
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,784
Have there ever been two human beings

146
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,919
more meant for each other? Oh.

147
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:57,823
And yet somehow, hackneyed circumstance and

148
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,626
a pudgy ex-bully have
somehow gotten between them.

149
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,128
I need to get these two

150
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,764
into a small, confined space

151
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:08,734
where they're forced to
gaze into each other's eyes.

152
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:11,604
And then, Becky,

153
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,139
then

154
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:17,810
the stinky frottage will commence.

155
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,180
Hey!

156
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,848
Your name is Kitty Wilde.

157
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,750
You were named after a
Bruce Springsteen song.

158
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:26,505
You don't trust newspapers
because you think

159
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,187
that they lied about Watergate.

160
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,289
You once beat up a mascot at
a little league softball game

161
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:31,757
for trying to start the wave with everyone.

162
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,626
You say that your favorite color is Jesus.

163
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,261
Oh, you prefer Triscuits over Wheat Thins.

164
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:36,695
And sometimes you don't wear underwear.

165
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,330
But I got that last one from Artie, so...

166
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:40,032
Are you trying to pick me
up? Because if you're gonna

167
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,767
go lezzy with a cheerleader,
I think the world's kind of

168
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:42,935
rooting for you and Quinn Fabray.

169
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,370
I just want you to know

170
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,038
that I've taken some
time to get to know you,

171
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,174
and that who you are is important to me.

172
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,542
So that I don't feel like I'm being used

173
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:50,976
when you ask me to join the Glee Club?

174
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,679
- Pretty much.
- Look, Rachel.

175
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:56,982
You have a reputation for being
an inherently selfish person.

176
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:58,818
You rarely ask people what they think,

177
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:01,020
and when you do, it's
usually in the context of.

178
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,321
"What do you think about me?"

179
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:03,856
I took a chance and joined.

180
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,825
Mr. Schuester's Glee Club because

181
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:07,893
I knew that even though
it was gonna hurt my rep

182
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,396
that it was being led
by a kind man committed

183
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,232
to teaching and that there
were a bunch of kids in there

184
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,386
that would have my back
when things got hairy.

185
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:16,535
Now, what's there?

186
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,204
A chubber, a transfer student

187
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:20,539
and a Bizarro Jaime and Cersei Lannister,

188
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:23,054
and an advisor who's
gonna jump ship as soon

189
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:25,711
as the real world invites
her back to the stage.

190
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,380
No, thanks.

191
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:31,484
Kitty, we need you.

192
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:33,219
All right? Your energy, your enthusiasm.

193
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:34,920
I don't know you very well,

194
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,890
but I know that you love performing.

195
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,527
I did.

196
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:44,230
I did love it.

197
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:46,098
You can sing, you can dance.

198
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,167
And-and, yes, Santana's cruelty

199
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,169
definitely scarred me
for the rest of my life,

200
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,738
but I know that the Glee
Club needs a top bitch

201
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:54,173
to keep everyone in line.

202
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,709
I invested everything into Glee Club.

203
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:58,878
And what did it get me?

204
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,513
They all deserted me.

205
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,581
The only reason I'm still here is

206
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:04,784
because Sue needed me for Cheerios!

207
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,298
I miss singing and dancing

208
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:10,122
and the feeling of being in the choir room.

209
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,091
But I know Sue...

210
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,859
and I know you.

211
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:16,462
And I don't want to jump back
in just to have my heart broken

212
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,016
again in a couple weeks
when it all goes away.

213
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,768
Look.

214
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:24,704
This is real.

215
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:28,074
Okay? I'm not going anywhere
until my job here is done

216
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:31,077
and the Glee Club is back
at McKinley permanently.

217
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:34,080
Look, you have my word.

218
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:35,881
You come back,

219
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,984
and we'll see this through together.

220
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,657
Oh, I'm sorry. Hi! Oh! Hi. Hi.

221
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,891
I thought you'd be in the auditorium.

222
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:47,126
The Warblers are about to go on.

223
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,061
No, no. I know. I-I just, um...

224
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:51,597
I've always wanted to use
the McKinley faculty bathroom

225
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:54,066
now that I'm sort of faculty myself.

226
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:55,101
Oh, so how was it?

227
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:57,169
It felt really grown up.

228
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,337
Oh, well, I'm headed back now.

229
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,492
Do you want to walk with me?

230
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:01,307
Yeah, that be nice.

231
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:03,576
Oh, hey.

232
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,244
- Is that new?
- Oh, yeah.

233
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,513
I guess so. That's convenient.

234
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,782
Yeah, sure, they get an elevator
after I already graduate, so...

235
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,584
All those years of carrying up
all those stairs. Such a drag.

236
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:13,319
Were you here when we had to
fight for that ramp outside?

237
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:15,021
Oh, I know. That was weird, too.

238
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,990
You excited to watch the Warblers perform?

239
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:19,358
I am. They're really good.

240
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,260
- How are the New Directions?
- Oh, you know.

241
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:22,461
They'll get there.

242
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:24,096
What a weird elevator.

243
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:26,499
Oh, my God, look, is this
a... is this a bathroom?

244
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:27,667
In an elevator?

245
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:31,671
I don't think we're moving.

246
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:34,373
Just press...

247
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,508
The doors... the doors aren't opening.

248
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:36,509
- No, press the buttons.
- They're not...

249
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:37,510
Just press the emergency thing.

250
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:38,811
Hello? Hello?

251
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:40,813
It should make a buzzing noise.

252
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:42,849
- Hello? Hello?
- Hi!

253
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:45,017
Let's pry it open. Let's just do one

254
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:47,220
at the same... at one time.  Ow!

255
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:51,457
I think we're locked in.

256
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:54,026
What kind of elevator is this?

257
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:01,234
I don't think this is a real elevator.

258
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:06,673
- Hey, where's Kurt?
- I have no idea!

259
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:09,576
He's not answering any of my
calls or texts or anything.

260
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,977
Oh, my goodness. I
have just been informed

261
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:13,313
by the head Warbler...
Whose name is Tristan

262
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:16,649
or Crispin or Montague or-or
something annoyingly fay...

263
00:10:16,684 --> 00:10:19,252
That their coach is currently missing.

264
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,721
Which, of course, is a shock to all of us.

265
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:24,691
Blaine, our hopes and prayers are with you.

266
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:27,594
But the show must go on.

267
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:31,097
Ladies and lady boys, I give you

268
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:34,367

How did you even...

313
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:56,309
And I'm already hypnotized.

314
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:58,811
Excellent.

315
00:12:58,846 --> 00:13:00,814
I need you to listen to me carefully.

316
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:02,182
Operation Break Rachel's Heart.

317
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:03,683
While Sabotaging the New Directions

318
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:05,485
is proceeding very nicely.

319
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,720
Have you thought about using a
shorter name for the operation?

320
00:13:07,755 --> 00:13:09,989
Your next objective is
to convince the glee club

321
00:13:10,024 --> 00:13:12,392
to perform these three musical numbers

322
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:13,993
at the invitational tomorrow.

323
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:15,161
It'll be

324
00:13:15,196 --> 00:13:16,596
the worst glee club set list

325
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,665
in human history.

326
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:21,067
Song number one:

327
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:24,170
"Ascension Millennium" by Corey Feldman.

328
00:13:24,205 --> 00:13:25,338
I don't know

329
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:27,006
why Corey Feldman is writing songs.

330
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,342
I don't know why he wrote
this particular song.

331
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:32,946
All I know is that the
first time I heard this song,

332
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,714
I literally could not move.

333
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:36,783
Song number two:

334
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:39,185
"Dear Mr. Jesus,"

335
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,087
a song about the horrors of child abuse

336
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:43,623
that actually makes you want
to go out and locate a child

337
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,458
for the express purpose of beating him up.

338
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:46,626
And the third

339
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,596
and final song in the
worst glee club set list

340
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,364
of all time:

341
00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:55,068
Tammy Wynette and KLF's...

342
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:57,136
"Justified and Ancient."

343
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:59,606
Hands down, the worst song ever written.

344
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,807
Got it.

345
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:02,609
Outstanding.

346
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:04,643
Hello, Officer, yes, I would like to file

347
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:06,079
a missing persons report.

348
00:14:06,113 --> 00:14:07,447
Um, my friend, Kurt Hummel,

349
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:09,048
he didn't show up for work today.

350
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,984
My name is Rachel Berry.

351
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:13,286
Yes, that was my TV show.

352
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,889
Yes, I've taken acting classes before.

353
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:19,425
You know what, sir, that
is very rude of you, and...

354
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,095
Hello? Hello?

355
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:26,833
Sam, hey, uh, have you heard

356
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,468
- from Kurt or Blaine at all?
- Relax, they're

357
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:30,303
probably at Sheets N' Things
registering for their wedding.

358
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:32,071
No, they're just friends now.

359
00:14:32,106 --> 00:14:34,007
No, they're endgame like
us, and to prove my love,

360
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,609
I am going to guarantee you
an invitational championship.

361
00:14:36,644 --> 00:14:37,744
Boom, you're welcome.

362
00:14:37,778 --> 00:14:39,078
"Justified and Ancient,."

363
00:14:39,113 --> 00:14:40,113
"Ascension Millennium,."

364
00:14:40,114 --> 00:14:41,915
"Dear Mr. Jesus."

365
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:44,317
- Sam, I don't, I don't know any
of these songs. - Oh, you will.

366
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:45,752
And as your future husband,
I demand that you do them.

367
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:47,754
- Oh, God, you're hot.
- Wait, wait.

368
00:14:47,788 --> 00:14:49,455
What's wrong with you?

369
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,456
I'm crazy in love with you.

370
00:14:50,491 --> 00:14:52,025
Sam, you told me two days ago

371
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,493
that you were in love with Mercedes.

372
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:54,527
That old hag?

373
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:57,831
Sam! No, look, I just... I'm sorry.

374
00:14:57,865 --> 00:15:00,266
Look, it feels really good to
have a guy be into me right now,

375
00:15:00,301 --> 00:15:02,368
but I just, I have so much going on.

376
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:03,937
I need my friends, and honestly

377
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:05,731
you're starting to freak
me out a little bit.

378
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,475
Okay, I-I'm really sorry.

379
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:11,144
I don't really understand what's
been going on with me lately.

380
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:14,113
I just have these big gaps in my memory.

381
00:15:14,148 --> 00:15:15,648
Like, even bigger than normal.

382
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:17,217
Okay, look, I promise

383
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:19,118
none of that will happen again.
Whatever you want me to do,

384
00:15:19,153 --> 00:15:20,353
uh, just let me know. I'm here.

385
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:22,055
Well, can you help me find Kurt?

386
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,023
And, oh, if you really want
to get in my good graces,

387
00:15:24,058 --> 00:15:25,658
then you can help me find seven new members

388
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:27,193
for the glee club. All right, I'm on it.

389
00:15:27,228 --> 00:15:28,461
Oh, and, Sam, I'm sorry,

390
00:15:28,496 --> 00:15:29,896
I-I'm not gonna use these.

391
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,365
Might be a huge mistake,

392
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,519
but I have to start
trusting my own instincts.

393
00:15:41,261 --> 00:15:42,962
Stop banging!

394
00:15:42,996 --> 00:15:45,364
No one can hear you.

395
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:46,759
Well, why don't you use your phone?

396
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:48,100
I'm at four percent.

397
00:15:48,135 --> 00:15:50,269
It just died.

398
00:15:50,304 --> 00:15:52,071
You got to stop charging every night.

399
00:15:52,105 --> 00:15:53,439
I've told you a hundred times.

400
00:15:53,473 --> 00:15:55,408
There's no reception in here anyway.

401
00:15:57,945 --> 00:15:59,979
Well, at least
we got that bathroom.

402
00:16:00,013 --> 00:16:01,414
God, I am losing my mind.

403
00:16:01,448 --> 00:16:03,368
We've got to find a way out of here.

404
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,990
Yeah, I don't...

405
00:16:16,196 --> 00:16:17,897
Hello, Klaine.

406
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:18,998
Let's play a game.

407
00:16:19,032 --> 00:16:21,467
You're trapped in an elevator.

408
00:16:21,502 --> 00:16:22,602
This isn't an elevator.

409
00:16:22,636 --> 00:16:24,137
You're trapped in an elevator

410
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:25,271
with a bathroom.

411
00:16:25,305 --> 00:16:27,006
If you don't find a way out,

412
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,741
you'll be forced to eat each other

413
00:16:28,775 --> 00:16:31,277
and then suffocate.

414
00:16:31,311 --> 00:16:33,479
But you have another choice.

415
00:16:33,514 --> 00:16:34,313
What?

416
00:16:34,348 --> 00:16:36,616
You and Blaine must kiss.

417
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,017
If you kiss each other,

418
00:16:38,051 --> 00:16:39,919
you will be allowed to leave this room.

419
00:16:39,953 --> 00:16:41,154
That's ridiculous.

420
00:16:41,188 --> 00:16:42,288
That's easy.

421
00:16:42,322 --> 00:16:43,422
That's all we got to do?

422
00:16:43,457 --> 00:16:45,591
Okay. Here we go.

423
00:16:45,626 --> 00:16:47,126
Here we go. Blaine and I
are about to kiss. Ready?

424
00:16:47,161 --> 00:16:48,161
There.

425
00:16:48,162 --> 00:16:49,629
No, not like that.

426
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,331
I want to see you really go at it.

427
00:16:52,366 --> 00:16:53,833
Just let us out, please!

428
00:16:53,867 --> 00:16:55,501
Just, no. We're not gonna do that.

429
00:16:55,536 --> 00:16:57,770
Fine, be that way.

430
00:16:57,805 --> 00:16:59,772
You're in for a long night,

431
00:16:59,807 --> 00:17:02,108
as the temperature of this
elevator with a bathroom

432
00:17:02,142 --> 00:17:04,877
rises and rises, and you'll be forced

433
00:17:04,912 --> 00:17:07,780
to remove more and more clothes.

434
00:17:09,082 --> 00:17:10,183
This is insane.

435
00:17:12,152 --> 00:17:14,821
How will you resist each other?

436
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:17,356
Scantily clad, burning with desire,

437
00:17:17,391 --> 00:17:19,959
enjoying a romantic dinner for two

438
00:17:19,993 --> 00:17:23,463
of roasted corn salad
and seared lamb tapenade,

439
00:17:23,497 --> 00:17:26,999
paired perfectly with a bottle
of playful, full-bodied Cabernet

440
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:29,669
with just the right amount of spice.

441
00:17:34,174 --> 00:17:37,677
Don't fight the Klaine romance.

442
00:17:37,711 --> 00:17:39,345
The choice is yours.

443
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,550
Come on, no! Come on!

444
00:17:45,552 --> 00:17:46,919
Come on!

445
00:17:48,389 --> 00:17:50,256
We are not gonna...

446
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,050
- kiss for your amusement.
- Oh, God.

447
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:54,594
What's in this?

448
00:17:56,063 --> 00:17:57,363
Oh. Oh, that's...

449
00:17:57,398 --> 00:17:59,799
Oh, this is a fun one.

450
00:18:01,802 --> 00:18:03,536
Okay, fine.

451
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:04,904
I'm in.

452
00:18:04,938 --> 00:18:06,572
Oh, my God, amazing.

453
00:18:08,776 --> 00:18:10,910
- Where is everybody?
- Oh, I called everyone

454
00:18:10,944 --> 00:18:12,879
and pushed glee rehearsal for an
hour because I'm still trying...

455
00:18:12,913 --> 00:18:14,047
To come up with a set list

456
00:18:14,081 --> 00:18:15,214
for a performance you're giving tomorrow?

457
00:18:15,249 --> 00:18:16,549
That's so Mr. Shue.

458
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,018
I can't decide if that's sad or adorable.

459
00:18:19,053 --> 00:18:20,286
The answer is adorable.

460
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,788
It's just that Sue is judging,

461
00:18:21,822 --> 00:18:23,523
and if she wasn't, then I'd have it,

462
00:18:23,557 --> 00:18:25,124
but I know she's gonna
hate anything that I pick.

463
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:26,526
I know.

464
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,194
You know what song she'd like?

465
00:18:28,228 --> 00:18:31,030
No, but I know where to find them.

466
00:18:31,065 --> 00:18:33,299
I probably shouldn't
be letting you do this,

467
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,734
being that you're a student and all.

468
00:18:34,768 --> 00:18:36,703
Plus, we're probably being recorded.

469
00:18:36,737 --> 00:18:39,138
No, I already cut the main
line to the security cameras

470
00:18:39,173 --> 00:18:40,540
and the alarm.

471
00:18:40,574 --> 00:18:42,108
<i>Look, I may not have lived</i>

472
00:18:42,142 --> 00:18:44,744
in some vague outer
borough of New York City,

473
00:18:44,778 --> 00:18:46,646
but there's a reason I'm the only glee kid

474
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,082
who survived Sue Sylvester's
regime at McKinley.

475
00:18:49,116 --> 00:18:51,117
Because I'm ruthless, too.

476
00:18:51,151 --> 00:18:52,618
Wait, how do you know her password?

477
00:18:54,488 --> 00:18:57,090
I bribed Becky with a box
of smuggled Mexican Twinkies.

478
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:59,592
<i>She's got a thing for
third-world snack cakes</i>

479
00:18:59,626 --> 00:19:02,562
<i>made with real sugar and animal shortening.</i>

480
00:19:02,596 --> 00:19:04,764
I don't want to know

481
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:07,467
what ThunderBolton69 means,

482
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:08,968
but she hasn't changed it in years.

483
00:19:09,003 --> 00:19:10,937
Okay, so what exactly are we looking for?

484
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:12,605
Sue has a secret playlist

485
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,908
of songs that she's so
emotionally vulnerable to

486
00:19:15,943 --> 00:19:17,243
that they're hidden

487
00:19:17,278 --> 00:19:19,646
in an encrypted, password-protected folder

488
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,980
only she can access.

489
00:19:21,015 --> 00:19:22,935
Wait, how do you have that password?

490
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:26,352
<i>Nicaraguan Ding-Dongs.</i>

491
00:19:27,388 --> 00:19:28,921
Take a look

492
00:19:28,956 --> 00:19:30,690
at these.

493
00:19:38,365 --> 00:19:40,600
Dude, it's almost 9:00.

494
00:19:40,634 --> 00:19:42,268
Wow, that is some serious commitment.

495
00:19:42,303 --> 00:19:44,437
Well, now that Beiste
is gone and you're coach,

496
00:19:44,471 --> 00:19:45,939
I assumed I'm gonna be starting QB.

497
00:19:45,973 --> 00:19:47,340
So I got to be ready, right?

498
00:19:47,374 --> 00:19:51,311
Yeah, um, actually, I kind of...

499
00:19:51,345 --> 00:19:53,713
changed my mind about that.

500
00:19:53,747 --> 00:19:55,281
What?

501
00:19:55,316 --> 00:19:56,783
What are you talking about, man?

502
00:19:56,817 --> 00:19:58,518
You told me that I was gonna be starting.

503
00:19:58,552 --> 00:20:00,553
Well, you know, you got
the arm for it, but, uh,

504
00:20:00,588 --> 00:20:02,188
quarterbacks are leaders, not cowards.

505
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,891
Are you calling me a wussy?

506
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:08,027
Yes, I am, actually. I
am calling you a wussy.

507
00:20:08,062 --> 00:20:10,830
You don't think I've noticed
you skulking around the glee club

508
00:20:10,865 --> 00:20:12,966
or I haven't seen you
coincidentally reading a book

509
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,634
just outside the choir
room during rehearsal?

510
00:20:14,668 --> 00:20:16,302
I'm walking a tightrope, man.

511
00:20:16,337 --> 00:20:17,871
I've got no wiggle room.

512
00:20:17,905 --> 00:20:21,407
I got to be tougher,
stronger and more manly

513
00:20:21,442 --> 00:20:23,076
than everyone else on the team

514
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:26,179
because if they smell even
a little bit of gay on me,

515
00:20:26,213 --> 00:20:27,580
I'm not their teammate anymore.

516
00:20:27,615 --> 00:20:29,315
I'm just another homo.

517
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,184
Dude, that's not true,
okay? Times have changed.

518
00:20:31,218 --> 00:20:35,154
If I join the glee club,
everything I worked so hard for,

519
00:20:35,189 --> 00:20:36,422
it's ruined.

520
00:20:36,457 --> 00:20:38,691
But you want to join.

521
00:20:38,726 --> 00:20:40,326
Of course I do.

522
00:20:40,361 --> 00:20:42,929
I'm a freakin' rock star, man.

523
00:20:42,963 --> 00:20:43,897
All right.

524
00:20:43,931 --> 00:20:45,999
But I'm stuck

525
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:48,234
singing and dancing alone in my bedroom,

526
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:51,104
because I don't want anyone
to think that I'm gay.

527
00:20:53,107 --> 00:20:54,841
Look, man.

528
00:20:56,744 --> 00:20:59,012
Every movement needs a
leader, someone to step out

529
00:20:59,046 --> 00:21:00,680
in the light and say, "Hey, this is me.

530
00:21:00,714 --> 00:21:02,615
This is who I am, and
this is what I stand for."

531
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,384
Look, I get it.

532
00:21:04,418 --> 00:21:05,518
High school is tough.

533
00:21:05,553 --> 00:21:06,686
But you can do this.

534
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,688
And they...

535
00:21:08,722 --> 00:21:11,925
they will lose their judgment
as soon as you lose yours.

536
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:13,159
I got your back here, dude.

537
00:21:14,094 --> 00:21:15,528
And that guy right there,

538
00:21:15,563 --> 00:21:18,264
Finn, was one of my best friends,

539
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:19,365
and he was

540
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,801
the quarterback here.

541
00:21:21,836 --> 00:21:23,703
And when he joined the glee club,

542
00:21:23,737 --> 00:21:26,573
it changed everything here forever.

543
00:21:27,975 --> 00:21:30,710
Pick up where he left off,

544
00:21:30,745 --> 00:21:32,979
and it'll be the best thing
that's ever happened to you.

545
00:21:39,213 --> 00:21:42,381
I thought you said you'd
never join the glee club again.

546
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,896
Well, someone has to stop you
from marrying your brother.

547
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,689
Oh, uh, Rachel, there's a
policeman in your office.

548
00:21:49,723 --> 00:21:51,791
Finally.

549
00:21:53,227 --> 00:21:54,861
Thank you so much for coming.
My friends are missing...

550
00:21:54,895 --> 00:21:55,895
What are you doing?

551
00:21:55,896 --> 00:21:57,363
You're gonna have to speak up.

552
00:21:57,397 --> 00:21:58,698
I got a bum ear. Scarlet fever.

553
00:21:58,732 --> 00:22:00,133
I know you.

554
00:22:00,167 --> 00:22:01,134
You're the Deaf Choir coach.

555
00:22:01,168 --> 00:22:02,568
<i>Was the Deaf Choir coach.</i>

556
00:22:02,603 --> 00:22:04,270
Oh, yeah, our funding got cut! Again.

557
00:22:04,304 --> 00:22:05,605
And maybe my kids

558
00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:07,874
don't always sing on
key or stay on the beat,

559
00:22:07,908 --> 00:22:09,208
but they got a song in their heart,

560
00:22:09,243 --> 00:22:10,309
and that's worth more
than all the tea in China.

561
00:22:10,344 --> 00:22:12,411
I guarantee you, we will be back.

562
00:22:12,446 --> 00:22:13,646
- Okay.
- But right now,

563
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,314
I got to make a living,

564
00:22:15,349 --> 00:22:16,983
so I'm a part-time cop,

565
00:22:17,017 --> 00:22:18,418
part-time mixed martial arts instructor.

566
00:22:18,452 --> 00:22:19,752
I hear your friends are missing.

567
00:22:19,787 --> 00:22:21,654
What are you doing?

568
00:22:21,688 --> 00:22:24,323
Uh, I'm sorry, we're looking
for my friends Kurt and Blaine.

569
00:22:24,358 --> 00:22:26,759
First we got to find Kurt
Hummel and Blaine Anderson.

570
00:22:26,794 --> 00:22:30,063
I'm-I'm so sorry. I'm just
really worried about my friends.

571
00:22:30,097 --> 00:22:31,964
You're probably worried about them,

572
00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:34,434
but I wouldn't if I were
you, because ten to one,

573
00:22:34,468 --> 00:22:36,002
they've eloped to New
York where they belong.

574
00:22:36,036 --> 00:22:37,636
You don't belong there; you're a quitter.

575
00:22:37,638 --> 00:22:40,139
You quit Broadway, you
did that horrible TV show.

576
00:22:40,174 --> 00:22:41,607
You get what you deserve, sister.

577
00:22:41,642 --> 00:22:44,077
And that Karofsky fellow... ugh.

578
00:22:44,111 --> 00:22:45,831
There's no way Blaine
is ending up with him.

579
00:22:45,846 --> 00:22:48,581
That hairy sack of crap, one
time, cut me off at a light

580
00:22:48,615 --> 00:22:50,116
- and gave me the finger.
- I'm sor...

581
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,951
Once a bully, always a bully, I say.

582
00:22:51,985 --> 00:22:53,252
I wouldn't be the least bit surprised

583
00:22:53,287 --> 00:22:54,620
if he kidnapped them.

584
00:22:54,655 --> 00:22:56,122
Wait a minute.

585
00:22:57,057 --> 00:22:59,525
Maybe it was you.

586
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,096
Funny Girl comes right back
to town, gets jealous of

587
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,664
- her more talented friends...
- What?

588
00:23:04,698 --> 00:23:05,998
...so she chops them up

589
00:23:06,033 --> 00:23:07,767
into little bits... Okay...

590
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:09,168
...puts them on her Hibachi
and feeds them to the new kids,

591
00:23:09,203 --> 00:23:10,203
'cause they're so naive

592
00:23:10,204 --> 00:23:12,004
they'd do anything you asked.

593
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:13,940
- All right, I get it.
- Uh-huh. You get a lawyer.

594
00:23:13,974 --> 00:23:15,334
I'll do that. Don't you leave town.

595
00:23:15,342 --> 00:23:16,976
Okay.

596
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:19,846
Uh, why don't we just do what we rehearsed?

597
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,049
The-the Bruno Mars set
list was too predictable.

598
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:24,784
These songs are more unassuming.

599
00:23:24,818 --> 00:23:26,652
They create an emotional resonance.

600
00:23:26,687 --> 00:23:28,154
Um, no disrespect,

601
00:23:28,188 --> 00:23:29,489
but we don't have time for a weekly lesson.

602
00:23:29,523 --> 00:23:30,623
Roderick is right.

603
00:23:30,657 --> 00:23:33,126
Maybe we should just
stick to our original plan.

604
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,561
Or we could shut our traps
and trust our teacher.

605
00:23:35,596 --> 00:23:37,130
Because, the last time I checked,

606
00:23:37,164 --> 00:23:39,499
Rachel Berry has more
talent in her little finger

607
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:42,168
than anyone in this stinkin', rotten town.

608
00:23:45,773 --> 00:23:49,375
Look, I'm gonna be
perfectly honest with you.

609
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,377
Sue Sylvester hates me.

610
00:23:51,412 --> 00:23:52,979
She always has.

611
00:23:53,013 --> 00:23:54,714
And now she hates you guys

612
00:23:54,748 --> 00:23:56,516
for joining the only club in the school

613
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,418
that she can't control.

614
00:23:58,452 --> 00:24:03,022
But it's not about winning a competition.

615
00:24:03,057 --> 00:24:05,825
It's about being able
to walk down the hallway

616
00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:09,162
and-and face Sue Sylvester...
Or any Sue Sylvester

617
00:24:09,196 --> 00:24:11,097
that you meet for the rest of your life

618
00:24:11,131 --> 00:24:13,232
and-and show them that
we may not always win,

619
00:24:13,267 --> 00:24:15,347
but we're not gonna go
down without a fight.

620
00:24:16,203 --> 00:24:17,570
So if you guys want to quit,

621
00:24:17,604 --> 00:24:18,838
now is the time.

622
00:24:18,872 --> 00:24:19,906
You'll probably have

623
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,007
an easier experience

624
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:22,608
at this school if you do.

625
00:24:22,643 --> 00:24:25,678
But if you don't want to,

626
00:24:25,713 --> 00:24:27,680
then we'll just stay here

627
00:24:27,715 --> 00:24:29,682
and-and we'll work super hard

628
00:24:29,717 --> 00:24:31,684
and put our noses to the grindstone

629
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:33,519
and we might even have
to pull an all-nighter.

630
00:24:33,554 --> 00:24:35,088
An all-nighter?

631
00:24:35,122 --> 00:24:36,456
That's amazing!

632
00:24:37,825 --> 00:24:39,692
Yeah, and we can order pizza

633
00:24:39,727 --> 00:24:41,461
and root beer and have, like, a party.

634
00:24:41,495 --> 00:24:44,030
I'm s... Are-are you joining us?

635
00:24:44,064 --> 00:24:45,298
You want to win, don't you?

636
00:24:45,332 --> 00:24:47,367
Yes! Yes!

637
00:24:47,401 --> 00:24:48,641
Yes, we do!

638
00:25:03,751 --> 00:25:06,231
No, it's-it's
the to-go breadsticks.

639
00:25:06,253 --> 00:25:07,487
We're definitely not gonna kiss later,

640
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:08,788
'cause I just had, like, a ton of...

641
00:25:08,822 --> 00:25:09,956
Now one, two, three, go.

642
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,124
Yes, okay, I know.

643
00:25:11,158 --> 00:25:12,125
On three. On three means...

644
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,327
One, two, three. Go.

645
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,444
I'll be right back.

646
00:25:31,478 --> 00:25:33,012
Hey.

647
00:25:33,047 --> 00:25:35,087
Look, Rachel, I get that you're mad at me,

648
00:25:35,115 --> 00:25:36,649
but I have a job to do,

649
00:25:36,684 --> 00:25:37,784
and that's coaching Vocal Adrenaline.

650
00:25:37,818 --> 00:25:39,652
I'm sorry.

651
00:25:39,687 --> 00:25:41,087
I was totally out of line.

652
00:25:41,121 --> 00:25:42,188
You were right.

653
00:25:42,222 --> 00:25:43,523
You were just doing your job...

654
00:25:43,557 --> 00:25:45,258
Which, by the way, is a lot harder

655
00:25:45,292 --> 00:25:46,693
than you made it out to be

656
00:25:46,727 --> 00:25:48,194
when you were teaching us.

657
00:25:48,228 --> 00:25:49,662
I know I'm not your student anymore,

658
00:25:49,697 --> 00:25:51,097
but you taught me

659
00:25:51,131 --> 00:25:52,699
a very important lesson in being a teacher,

660
00:25:52,733 --> 00:25:55,201
which is that you have to
be devoted to your kids.

661
00:25:55,235 --> 00:25:57,270
Well, between you and me, it's a lot harder

662
00:25:57,304 --> 00:25:59,505
to be devoted to kids I
don't particularly like.

663
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,840
Sorry.

664
00:26:00,874 --> 00:26:03,176
How are your kids doing?
Are they... they ready?

665
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:04,978
They're good. Actually, I'm kind of dying.

666
00:26:05,012 --> 00:26:07,347
I just... I want them to be so good.

667
00:26:07,381 --> 00:26:08,715
I-I don't know. It's weird.

668
00:26:08,749 --> 00:26:09,949
I want this part to be over with.

669
00:26:09,984 --> 00:26:11,484
No, no, no. No.

670
00:26:11,518 --> 00:26:13,119
Enjoy this.

671
00:26:13,153 --> 00:26:14,854
Enjoy the beginning and
the not knowing and the...

672
00:26:14,888 --> 00:26:16,222
and the first steps with them.

673
00:26:16,256 --> 00:26:17,496
Because one day,

674
00:26:17,524 --> 00:26:18,558
years from now,

675
00:26:18,592 --> 00:26:20,026
you'll be talking to one of them

676
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,894
and you'll be amazed by the
man or woman they've become.

677
00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:24,163
- Thanks, Mr. Shue.
- Yeah.

678
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:26,532
You are welcome.

679
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:28,301
But I am still a little upset with you.

680
00:26:28,335 --> 00:26:29,575
I mean, all I did

681
00:26:29,603 --> 00:26:31,070
was put the best team
I could on that stage.

682
00:26:31,105 --> 00:26:33,072
You were the one that started
in with the dirty tricks,

683
00:26:33,107 --> 00:26:34,574
like sending Sam to steal my mail.

684
00:26:34,608 --> 00:26:35,975
I didn't do that.

685
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,977
- Sue.
- Sue.

686
00:26:38,012 --> 00:26:39,646
Hey!

687
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,147
Let's move this thing along, huh?

688
00:26:41,181 --> 00:26:43,516
These rotten tomatoes are getting restless.

689
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,018
Great.

690
00:26:45,052 --> 00:26:47,553
Appreciate her, too.

691
00:26:47,588 --> 00:26:49,522
A good nemesis only makes you better.

692
00:26:49,556 --> 00:26:52,036
Break a leg.

693
00:26:53,227 --> 00:26:55,762
Well, that can't be good.

694
00:26:55,796 --> 00:26:57,096
Okay, you ready for this?

695
00:26:57,131 --> 00:26:58,331
All right, cool. Here we go.

696
00:26:58,365 --> 00:26:59,732
Oh! Okay.

697
00:26:59,767 --> 00:27:02,769
This is, this is a,
uh, a creamy pasta dish.

698
00:27:02,803 --> 00:27:05,283
And we said that if we
ever had a celebrity child,

699
00:27:05,306 --> 00:27:07,173
this is what we would name it.

700
00:27:07,207 --> 00:27:09,175
- Fettuccini Alfredo.
- Yes! Yes.

701
00:27:09,209 --> 00:27:10,710
- I always liked that name.
- Yeah.

702
00:27:10,744 --> 00:27:12,412
- Alfredo.
- The little fettuccine.

703
00:27:12,446 --> 00:27:14,013
- Little-little feta.
- Aw...

704
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,181
- Um, all right.
- Mm-hmm.

705
00:27:15,215 --> 00:27:16,616
Um, okay.

706
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,952
If... if I was an ironic rapper,

707
00:27:18,986 --> 00:27:20,420
this would be my name.

708
00:27:20,454 --> 00:27:21,587
- Ironic rapper.
- Okay.

709
00:27:21,622 --> 00:27:23,423
We-we drink it when we, um...

710
00:27:23,457 --> 00:27:25,058
when we were, when we were playing...

711
00:27:25,092 --> 00:27:26,759
when we were ice skating at Bryant Park.

712
00:27:26,794 --> 00:27:28,428
- Definitely would have to
be something with... - Um...

713
00:27:28,462 --> 00:27:30,129
- ...hot chocolate.
- Yes! Yes.

714
00:27:30,164 --> 00:27:31,397
- Hot chocolate.
- Mm-hmm.

715
00:27:31,432 --> 00:27:32,532
That would be your ironic rapper name.

716
00:27:32,566 --> 00:27:33,566
Good one. Good job.

717
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,760
You would be MC Hot Chocolate.

718
00:27:34,768 --> 00:27:36,135
MC Hot Chocolate.

719
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,704
Oh, the life I never lived.

720
00:27:37,738 --> 00:27:39,138
What a tragedy. You're
in the wrong profession.

721
00:27:39,173 --> 00:27:40,440
What are you, a teacher now? Mm-hmm.

722
00:27:40,474 --> 00:27:41,474
- Yeah.
- You're blowing it.

723
00:27:41,508 --> 00:27:42,909
Okay, my turn. MC Hot Chocolate

724
00:27:42,943 --> 00:27:44,544
is calling your name. All right.

725
00:27:44,578 --> 00:27:46,479
Okay.

726
00:27:46,513 --> 00:27:47,981
Um, okay, this is a dessert.

727
00:27:48,015 --> 00:27:49,549
It's cold. Uh...

728
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:51,217
- Um, it comes in a cart...
- Parfait.

729
00:27:51,251 --> 00:27:53,086
Oh, uh, Dave eats this all the time.

730
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,587
Like, he...

731
00:27:54,622 --> 00:27:56,222
a little too much, if you ask me.

732
00:27:56,256 --> 00:27:58,736
He eats so much of this...

733
00:27:59,927 --> 00:28:01,967
So hot in here, I think I'm gonna be sick.

734
00:28:08,636 --> 00:28:11,471
Because you refuse to give back

735
00:28:11,505 --> 00:28:14,407
to the world the Klaine
romance you're depriving it...

736
00:28:14,441 --> 00:28:17,910
A romance it so desperately needs...

737
00:28:17,945 --> 00:28:20,647
We're going to change the game a little.

738
00:28:20,681 --> 00:28:22,849
What is that?

739
00:28:22,883 --> 00:28:25,118
It's the drug Tadalifil

740
00:28:25,152 --> 00:28:26,619
in aerosol form.

741
00:28:26,654 --> 00:28:29,922
And it's filling this room

742
00:28:29,957 --> 00:28:31,824
right now.

743
00:28:31,859 --> 00:28:35,361
It promotes sexual stimulation
by increased blood flow

744
00:28:35,396 --> 00:28:37,263
to the male genitalia.

745
00:28:39,566 --> 00:28:43,102
Try to resist the love you
have for one another, Klaine.

746
00:28:43,137 --> 00:28:45,838
Just know that if you choose to resist,

747
00:28:45,873 --> 00:28:48,107
you choose to die.

748
00:28:48,142 --> 00:28:49,275
The choice is yours.

749
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,778
I want to get out of here.

750
00:28:51,812 --> 00:28:54,280
It's just so hot, and...

751
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:55,715
Yes.

752
00:28:55,749 --> 00:28:58,151
Not sexually hot.

753
00:28:58,185 --> 00:28:59,619
It's just actually hot,

754
00:28:59,653 --> 00:29:01,321
and I want to go home, I
want to get out of here.

755
00:29:01,355 --> 00:29:03,823

that this doesn't have to mean anything?

767
00:29:55,686 --> 00:29:57,820

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

892
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:49,787
In third place, and just not
doing a very good job at all,

893
00:36:49,822 --> 00:36:51,689
ladies and gentlemen, from Dalton Academy,

894
00:36:51,723 --> 00:36:53,843
- the Warblers.
- What?

895
00:36:55,694 --> 00:36:57,662
You really didn't do a very good job.

896
00:36:57,696 --> 00:36:58,996
Congratulations.

897
00:37:00,365 --> 00:37:02,333
And in second place,

898
00:37:02,367 --> 00:37:05,069
this year's runner-up and winner

899
00:37:05,103 --> 00:37:08,806
of this bedazzled bowling
pin I found in the Dumpster,

900
00:37:08,841 --> 00:37:11,008
from Carmel High, Vocal Adrenaline.

901
00:37:16,048 --> 00:37:17,348
Congratulations.

902
00:37:17,382 --> 00:37:18,749
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

903
00:37:18,784 --> 00:37:20,084
And finally,

904
00:37:20,118 --> 00:37:21,819
first place for this year's invitational...

905
00:37:21,854 --> 00:37:23,221
I don't know how they did it,

906
00:37:23,255 --> 00:37:24,889
because they were sitting on stools,

907
00:37:24,923 --> 00:37:26,357
singing in unison...

908
00:37:26,391 --> 00:37:28,431
Ladies and gentlemen, from McKinley High,

909
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,594
New Directions!

910
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,614
I'm sorry, Clint.

911
00:37:49,648 --> 00:37:51,182
I-I know that you feel disappointed.

912
00:37:51,216 --> 00:37:53,117
Disappointed?

913
00:37:53,152 --> 00:37:54,619
Look, it's not always about winning.

914
00:37:54,653 --> 00:37:55,753
Come on, please.

915
00:37:55,787 --> 00:37:57,288
You screwed us, Schuester.

916
00:37:57,322 --> 00:37:59,423
You care more about your
little prodigal troll,

917
00:37:59,458 --> 00:38:01,025
Rachel Berry, than us.

918
00:38:01,059 --> 00:38:03,628
I'm a senior; this matters to me.

919
00:38:03,662 --> 00:38:05,129
So you better watch your back.

920
00:38:05,164 --> 00:38:06,464
Don't talk to me like that.

921
00:38:06,498 --> 00:38:07,865
I'm your coach and your teacher.

922
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,001
We'll see about that.

923
00:38:20,846 --> 00:38:22,146
Like what you see?

924
00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:26,884
Sweet William, here we are again.

925
00:38:26,919 --> 00:38:28,619
Well, I hope you're happy, Sue.

926
00:38:28,654 --> 00:38:30,121
Oh, I am.

927
00:38:30,155 --> 00:38:31,622
I'm absolutely over the moon, actually.

928
00:38:31,657 --> 00:38:33,624
Something profound
happened to me out there,

929
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:35,560
listening to that music.

930
00:38:35,594 --> 00:38:37,595
I've purged the anger.

931
00:38:37,629 --> 00:38:39,831
Well, I'm happy for you, Sue.

932
00:38:39,865 --> 00:38:41,899
Oh, I'm happy for me, too.

933
00:38:41,934 --> 00:38:44,735
And if you...

934
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:47,238
ever...

935
00:38:47,272 --> 00:38:50,241
litter at my school again
and expect me to clean it up,

936
00:38:50,275 --> 00:38:52,577
you sorry excuse for a stain

937
00:38:52,611 --> 00:38:56,514
on a dead tramp's lacy panties,

938
00:38:56,548 --> 00:38:58,683
I swear to sweet holy Satan,

939
00:38:58,717 --> 00:39:01,052
I will end you.

940
00:39:11,063 --> 00:39:12,864
Hello, Klaine.

941
00:39:12,898 --> 00:39:14,265
Stop calling us that!

942
00:39:14,299 --> 00:39:16,100
Are you aware we could have you locked up

943
00:39:16,135 --> 00:39:17,535
in a federal prison for 20 years?

944
00:39:17,569 --> 00:39:19,637
What you did to us falls
under the legal definition

945
00:39:19,671 --> 00:39:20,972
of kidnapping.

946
00:39:21,006 --> 00:39:23,307
I genuinely have no idea
what you're talking about.

947
00:39:23,342 --> 00:39:26,310
Are you kidding? We were
locked in an overheated elevator

948
00:39:26,345 --> 00:39:29,213
with a little Sue Sylvester
thing in a tracksuit

949
00:39:29,248 --> 00:39:31,382
and on-on a tricycle with a
hideous papier-mâché face.

950
00:39:31,417 --> 00:39:32,884
Remember that?

951
00:39:32,918 --> 00:39:35,553
Becky did it.

952
00:39:35,587 --> 00:39:37,155
- I can't. This is pointless.
- You know what?

953
00:39:37,189 --> 00:39:38,523
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on a sec.

954
00:39:38,557 --> 00:39:40,792
Y-You know... you know what, Sue?

955
00:39:40,826 --> 00:39:43,461
Whatever you were trying to do,

956
00:39:43,495 --> 00:39:45,329
I want you to know that...

957
00:39:45,364 --> 00:39:47,331
it backfired.

958
00:39:47,366 --> 00:39:51,302
Because all it really
did was help Kurt and I

959
00:39:51,336 --> 00:39:54,672
get over whatever resentment
and whatever bitterness

960
00:39:54,706 --> 00:39:56,808
we were holding in, and it made us realize

961
00:39:56,842 --> 00:40:00,311
that-that we are... we're-we're
just better as friends, okay?

962
00:40:00,345 --> 00:40:02,513
So we should actually thank you.

963
00:40:02,548 --> 00:40:03,581
Well, then thank me.

964
00:40:03,615 --> 00:40:05,917
- Thank you.
- Don't actually thank her.

965
00:40:05,951 --> 00:40:07,819
So...

966
00:40:07,853 --> 00:40:09,821
Klaine is no more, huh?

967
00:40:09,855 --> 00:40:11,356
Okay.

968
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:15,326
Well, guess I'll have to find a new hobby,

969
00:40:15,361 --> 00:40:18,496
like operating a bookmaking
outfit that runs the numbers

970
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:21,232
on which of your current
boyfriends dies first.

971
00:40:21,266 --> 00:40:26,838
The gropey geriatric that
Porcelain reads the newspaper to

972
00:40:26,872 --> 00:40:29,107
or the bloated, suicidal,
diabetic ex-bully

973
00:40:29,141 --> 00:40:34,245
that the gay, shaven, teenage
Tom Selleck chooses to bone.

974
00:40:41,286 --> 00:40:44,956
Becky, this space feels
more like somebody's memory

975
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:48,126
of a storage unit, and
that memory is fading.

976
00:40:49,995 --> 00:40:52,797
It's like there was never
anything here but jungle.

977
00:40:52,831 --> 00:40:54,899
What are you talking about?

978
00:40:54,933 --> 00:40:58,736
And time, well, time is a flat circle.

979
00:40:58,771 --> 00:41:03,608
And we have had a most awesome week, Becky.

980
00:41:03,642 --> 00:41:05,610
Honestly, what we accomplished in this week

981
00:41:05,644 --> 00:41:07,278
makes it feel like two weeks.

982
00:41:07,312 --> 00:41:09,480
Your plan didn't work out.

983
00:41:09,515 --> 00:41:13,318
Kurt and Gay Blaine aren't together.

984
00:41:13,352 --> 00:41:15,953
Oh, Becky.

985
00:41:15,988 --> 00:41:18,489
I've got Klaine right where I want them.

986
00:41:18,524 --> 00:41:20,992
See here? Right on schedule.

987
00:41:21,026 --> 00:41:24,162
Week five, Klaine friends again.

988
00:41:24,196 --> 00:41:27,332
We still have six more weeks for scheming,

989
00:41:27,366 --> 00:41:30,868
possibly seven, depending
on network preemptions.

990
00:41:32,037 --> 00:41:33,671
This is kind of garbage.

991
00:41:33,706 --> 00:41:35,406
That's not even a real trophy.

992
00:41:35,441 --> 00:41:37,308
It's a start.

993
00:41:37,343 --> 00:41:41,179
From small things, big things one day come.

994
00:41:41,213 --> 00:41:42,780
Hold up, Rachel.

995
00:41:42,815 --> 00:41:43,815
I got this.

996
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:45,783
Listen up, noobs.

997
00:41:46,952 --> 00:41:48,186
We just went up against

998
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,520
the two best show choirs in the state.

999
00:41:49,555 --> 00:41:50,955
They were full of seniors

1000
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,857
who have been working together for years.

1001
00:41:52,891 --> 00:41:54,171
They thought they were gonna come

1002
00:41:54,193 --> 00:41:56,094
into our house and push us around.

1003
00:41:56,128 --> 00:41:58,208
But now they all went home
feeling like their willies

1004
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,230
are two inches shorter.

1005
00:41:59,231 --> 00:42:00,765
Now, I expect to make fun

1006
00:42:00,799 --> 00:42:03,034
of all of you at some point. Fat kid,

1007
00:42:03,068 --> 00:42:05,270
gay boy, creepy incest twins, other girl.

1008
00:42:05,304 --> 00:42:08,773
But I never want to hear any
of you disparaging the things

1009
00:42:08,807 --> 00:42:10,942
that we do as a team.

1010
00:42:10,976 --> 00:42:12,610
Got it?

1011
00:42:12,645 --> 00:42:13,945
Um...

1012
00:42:13,979 --> 00:42:15,780
can I just say something?

1013
00:42:15,814 --> 00:42:18,149
I just wanted to say thank you to Ms. Berry

1014
00:42:18,183 --> 00:42:20,818
and Mr. Hummel for, you
know, bringing us all together

1015
00:42:20,853 --> 00:42:22,720
and helping us do so well up there.

1016
00:42:22,755 --> 00:42:24,389
You guys are both really good teachers.

1017
00:42:24,423 --> 00:42:27,458
Thank you. As your teachers, we just

1018
00:42:27,493 --> 00:42:30,128
want to say how proud of you guys we are.

1019
00:42:30,162 --> 00:42:31,563
I mean, I never would've
thought coming back here

1020
00:42:31,597 --> 00:42:33,164
that I would step on a
stage without disintegrating

1021
00:42:33,198 --> 00:42:35,667
into a puddle, but thank
you, guys, so much just for...

1022
00:42:35,701 --> 00:42:37,635
I heard she tends
to make everything about herself.

1023
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,504
Shh, if you're
gonna say things like that to me,

1024
00:42:39,538 --> 00:42:41,372
you need to use your psychic inside voice.

1025
00:42:41,407 --> 00:42:43,841
It's just the
beginning, guys. - Got it?

1026
00:42:43,876 --> 00:42:47,248
Everyone put your hand in. I'm gonna lead
you through an ancient Glee tradition.

1027
00:42:47,287 --> 00:42:50,866
All right, on three, give me an
"amazing." Kitty, count us in.

1028
00:42:50,891 --> 00:42:54,385
- One, two, three.
- Amazing!
