00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:27,875
(Cat wails)

2
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:31,000
(Dogs bark)

3
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:52,416
Someone once said, if it was raining brains,

4
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,958
Roxy Robinson wouldn't even get wet.

5
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:09,541
Roxy had spent his whole life
making two and two into five.

6
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:13,500
But he could smell trouble
like other people could smell gas.

7
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:18,166
But believe yous me, he shouldn't have taken
that blind alley by the side of Parito's bakery.

8
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,416
¡Oiga! ¿Qué se imaginaba?
¿Que no queremos dormir?

9
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,708
Ruido, ruido, ruido.
Es como vivir al lado del ferrocarril.

10
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:27,875
- Vaya a su casa y déjanos dormir.
- (Baby wails)

11
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,166
Your name Robinson?

12
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,416
Roxy Robinson?

13
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,458
You work for Fat Sam?

14
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:54,916
Whatever game it was everybody was playing,

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
sure as eggs is eggs,
Roxy the Weasel had been scrambled.

16
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,375
# He's a sinner

17
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:04,500
# Candy-coated

18
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,208
# For all his friends

19
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:10,208
# He always seems to be alone

20
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,333
# But they love him

21
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:17,500
# Bugsy Malone

22
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,916
# A city slicker

23
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,666
# He can charm you with a smile

24
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,458
# And a style all his own

25
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,416
# Everybody loves that man

26
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,416
# Bugsy Malone

27
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,708
# Hot-headed Bugsy makes his mind up

28
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,791
# Don't mess with Bugsy

29
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,958
# Or you'll wind up

30
00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:01,416
# Wishing you'd left well enough alone

31
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,666
# He's a man, a mountain, he's a rolling stone

32
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:13,750
# And will he leave you, sad and lonely, crying?

33
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,875
# I couldn't say

34
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,041
# But it's known

35
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,583
# That everybody wants that man

36
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,375
# Bugsy Malone

37
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:36,250
Now, my friends,
I should be filling yous in a little.

38
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:39,125
This guy yous looking at is the hero of our story.

39
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,250
Name of Bugsy Malone.

40
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:45,791
A nice guy. A little too popular
with the broads for my liking, but a nice guy.

41
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:50,458
An Italian mother, an Irish father,
he's naturally grown up a little confused.

42
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,583
Kind of mixed-up.

43
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,708
Oh, by the ways, I nearly forgot.

44
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,666
My name's Sam.
Fat Sam, on account of my physique.

45
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,375
I ain't no dumb bum.

46
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:02,416
And between yous and me,
this ain't no book store.

47
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,916
This is my place. Fat Sam's Grand Slam.
Best joint in town.

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,625
Hi, Jelly.

49
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,375
Hi, Bugsy.

50
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,375
(Band plays Bugsy Malone theme)

51
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,541
(Buzz of conversation)

52
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,500
RADIO: We interrupt this program
to bring you a newsflash.

53
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:44,208
Reports are coming in
of a gangland incident on the Lower East Side,

54
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:48,500
involving a certain Robert Robinson,
known to the police as Roxy the Weasel,

55
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:51,458
believed to be a member
of the gang of alleged mobster king

56
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,375
Fat Sam Stacetto.

57
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:56,166
Robinson was the victim of a sensational event

58
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,791
and we go over to our reporter on the spot...

59
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:03,083
So, tell me, how do you allow this to happen?

60
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,166
Roxy was one of my best.

61
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,875
What have you got to say for yourselves,
you bunch of dummies?

62
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,791
Call yourselves hoodlums?

63
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:15,500
You're a disgrace to your profession,
you hear me? A disgrace!

64
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,625
And most of all, a disgrace to me. Fat Sam.

65
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:22,625
(Knuckles crack)
- And we all know who's behind this, don't we?

66
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,000
ALL: Sure do, Boss.

67
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,416
Don't need a headful of brains
to know that, do you?

68
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,291
ALL: Certainly not, Boss.

69
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,500
So, who is it, you dummies? Tell me. Who?

70
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,833
ALL: Dandy Dan, Boss.

71
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,958
Don't you dare mention that name in this office!

72
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,625
- Hey, take it easy, Boss. Sit down.
(Knock at door)

73
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,666
Come in.

74
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,875
Excuse me. I'm Blousey Brown.

75
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,500
I'm a singer. I'm here about the audition.

76
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:49,083
A singer, a singer.
Listen, sister, right now I don't need a singer.

77
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,458
Come back tomorrow.

78
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:53,833
Hey, Boss, how about my audition?
You said last week I'd be OK.

79
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,458
Am I going mad?
Are my ears playing tricks on me?

80
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,500
Will you get out of here?

81
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,458
Dancers, dancers,
I'm surrounded by namby-pamby dancers,

82
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:08,083
singers, piano players, banjo players,
tin whistle players, at a time when I need brains.

83
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,041
You hear me? Brains. Brains and muscles!

84
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,125
You've got us, Boss.

85
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:16,875
You, you great hunk of lard!
You got muscle where you oughtta have brains.

86
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:20,166
My pet canary has got more brains than you,
you great dumb salami.

87
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,541
Tell me, what's funny?

88
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,208
ALL: Nothing, Boss.

89
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:38,125
Don't worry, babe. I've been trying to see him
for months and months and months.

90
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,041
- You have?
- Of course I have.

91
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,291
What do you do?

92
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,500
I'm only the greatest tap-dancer on Earth.

93
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,250
- You are?
- Of course I are. I cross my heart.

94
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,166
But all he ever says is, "Come back tomorrow."

95
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,000
I ask you, how many times
can I come back tomorrow?

96
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,500
(Applause from the club)

97
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:06,000

(Cheering and whistling)

Do you know something? You look like
you put your face on backwards this morning.

149
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,500
You've got too much mouth, mack.

150
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,666
So, tell my dentist.

151
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,791
Would you watch where you're going?

152
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,916
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,708
- What have you got, an ice hockey stick?
- No. Just a baseball bat.

154
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,208
You're a baseball player, right?

155
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,791
No, I'm a dancer. My mother made me pack it.

156
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:53,041
- You're a sports nut?
- It's for protection. In case I get robbed.

157
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,958
Do you take it everywhere you go?

158
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,250
No. I was here about a job today.

159
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:00,000
- Did you get it?
- They said, "Come back tomorrow."

160
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,125
- What's your name anyway?
- Brown.

161
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,541
"Brown"? Sounds like a loaf of bread.

162
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,666
Blousey Brown.

163
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,333
"Blousey Brown"?
Sounds like a stale loaf of bread.

164
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,416
Ha-ha, very funny. Terrific.

165
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,958
Pleased to meet you. I'm Bugsy Malone.

166
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,208
Don't call us. We'll call you.

FAT SAM: OK, everybody, it's OK.

169
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,875
Just a little excitement, that's all.

170
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:52,208
Razzmatazz, music.
I want to see everybody enjoying themselves.

171
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:56,125
No-one can say
Fat Sam's joint ain't the liveliest joint in town.

172

Knuckles,

173
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,541
this means trouble.

174
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,625
You know what to do?

175
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,375
Sure, Boss.

176
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,708
Step on it, Jackson.

177
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,041
(Screeching)

178
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,666
COMMENTARY: ..the 20-yard line.

179
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,625
He's over!

180
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,750
One touchdown so far this afternoon.

181
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,708
# Plaintive tune

182
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,083
(Screaming)

183
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,916
Hey, what is this?

184
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:36,875
Irving?

185
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,666
Come on, Doodle, get out of there.

186
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,291
- Have you located the splurge gun yet, sir?
- I'm afraid I can't answer that.

187
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,125
- You're not at liberty to say?
- No, I don't know the answer.

188
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,666
- Do you know where the guns are coming from?
- I'm not at liberty to say.

189
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,458
You'll have to ask Captain Smolsky
that question.

190
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,625
OK, O'Dreary, break this crowd up.

191
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,250
- Have you located the splurge gun yet?
- No comment.

192
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,875
- Have you located the source of the guns?
- No comment.

193
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:15,208
Is it true
the gun is being used by only one gang?

194
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,750
No comment.

195
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,125
Can I give you a lift?

196
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,250
- Got a car?
- No.

197
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:31,083
So, how are you gonna give me a lift, buster?
Stand me on a box?

198
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,875
I thought we'd share a cab.

199
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,000
Forget it. I don't share fares.

200
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,916
I'm a lady.

201
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,041
Furthermore, I'm broke.

202
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,166
Who said anything about sharing fares?

203
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,250
No?

204
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,041
- Certainly not. I wouldn't dream of it.
- You wouldn't?

205
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:48,083
- I thought you'd pay.
- Swell.

206
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,625
Well, let's walk anyway. It's a nice night.

207
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:55,083
You shouldn't walk the streets at night.
It's dangerous.

208
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,500
We'll be OK. We've got your baseball bat.

209
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:00,375
Quit the "we" bit, buster. You mean I'll be OK.

210
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,416
Which way are you going?

211
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,833
Which way are you going?

212
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:08,916
This way.

213
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,875
Then I'm going this way.

214
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,208
Here, let me take that.

215
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,750
No, it's all right. Look, beat it, will you?

216
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,833
Mamma mia! What have you got in here?

217
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,541
Just a few books.

218
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,791
A few books?! You should start a library.

219
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,500
You should shut your mouth.

220
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,208
Have you eaten?

221
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,916
Ever since I was a kid.

222
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,833
Then how come you're so skinny, wisey?

223
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,875
- Because I watch my weight.
- I do that when I'm broke, too.

224
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,583
How about eating now?

225
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:39,666
No.

226
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,375
- Why not?
- I'm not hungry.

227
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,166
- You're not hungry?
- No.

228
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,625
I'm starving.

229
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,333
That's more like it.

230
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,458
That dress, that was awful.

231
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,625
The colors!

232
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,416
Good night, Fizzy.

233
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,333
Good night.

234
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,833
Good night, Fizzy.

235
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,375
Nighty-night.

236
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,666
Take it easy, now.

237
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,833
(Cracks knuckles)

238
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,750
Don't do that, Knuckles.

239
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,875
It's how I got my name, Boss.

240
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,541
Well, knock it off, or else change your name.

241
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,875
Tallulah, how much longer
do you want us to wait?

242
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,208
Coming, honey. You don't want me
to look a mess, do you, sweetheart?

243
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,916
Snap it up, will ya?

244
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,125
Put your flaps down, tiger, or you'll take off.

245
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:31,583
You spend more time prettying yourself up
than there is time in the day.

246
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:34,875
If I didn't look this good,
you wouldn't give me the time of day.

247
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,833
I'll see you in the car.

248
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,500
Hey, Boss, how about my audition?

249
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,916
Tomorrow, Fizzy, tomorrow. I'm very tired.

250
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,375
A lot of important business to do.
I have to go home. Please. Goodbye.

251
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:48,083
I promise you, tomorrow, OK?
Tomorrow. Good night.

252
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,458
Are you coming, Velma?

253
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:52,958
Sure.

254
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,500
- Good night, Fizzy.
- Good night, Miss Tallulah.

255
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,541
Oh, my purse.

256
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,791
# Tomorrow

257
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:20,375
# Tomorrow never comes

258
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:27,041
# What kind of a fool do they take me for?

259
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,166
# Tomorrow

260
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,708
# A resting place for bums

261
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:37,875
# A trap set in the slums

262
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:41,333
# But I know the score

263
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:45,916
# I won't take no for an answer

264
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,500
# I was born to be a dancer

265
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:52,291
# Now, yeah

266
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,208
# Tomorrow

267
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,291
# Tomorrow, as they say

268
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,458
# Another working day

269
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:10,666
# And another chore

270
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,125
# Tomorrow

271
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:17,291
# An awful price to pay

272
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,458
# I gave up yesterday

273
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:24,500
# But they still want more

274
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:29,666
# They are bound
to compare me to Fred Astaire

275
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:33,916
# When I'm done, yeah

276
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:41,416
# Anyone who feels
the rhythm moving through 'em

277
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:47,875
# Knows it's gonna do 'em good
to let the music burst out

278
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:54,291
# When you feel it, show it,
let the people know it

279
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,416
# Let your laughter loose

280
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:06,750
# Until your scream becomes a love shout

281
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,583
# Tomorrow

282
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:24,666
# Tomorrow's far away

283
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,541
# Tomorrow, as they say

284
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,708
# Is reserved for dreams

285
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,875
# Tomorrow

286
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,666
# Tomorrow's looking grey

287
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,833
# A playground always locked

288
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:45,625
# Trains no winning teams

289
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:49,208
# Won't take no for an answer

290
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,875
# I was born to be a dancer

291
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:57,125
# Now, yeah

292
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,583
# Anyone who feels
the rhythm moving through 'em

293
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,666
# Knows it's gonna do 'em good

294
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:09,125
# To let the music burst out

295
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:15,458
# When you feel it, show it,
let the people know it

296
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,583
# Let your laughter loose

297
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:27,875
# Until your scream becomes a love shout

298
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,708
Going back to the speakeasy tomorrow?

299
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:18,958
It depends. I'm going to try my luck at the
Bijou Theatre. They're auditioning tomorrow.

300
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,375
Lena Marelli's show?

301
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:23,000
She walked out.
They're replacing the whole thing.

302
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,458
How long have you wanted to be a singer?

303
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,583
Since I was a kid, I guess.

304
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:31,625
Actually, I don't want just to be a singer.
I want to be a movie star.

305
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,125
In Hollywood.

306
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,625
What's so funny?

307
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,333
I don't know.

308
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:41,250
It's just that there was a time when people
were happy being railway engineers.

309
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,875
- Or nurses.
- Don't you want to be anybody?

310
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,875
Nah, I'm happy being me.

311
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,083
- And what do you do?
- Oh, this and that.

312
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,750
Crooked, huh?

313
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,708
Nah. In between.

314
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,125
What do you do for money?

315
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,958
I find fighters, boxers.

316
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,458
You do?

317
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,416
I used to fight, myself.

318
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,708
How good were you?

319
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:02,291
- I coulda been a contender, Charlie.
- You could?

320
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,875
Sure. But for a few things.

321
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,041
Like what?

322
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,000
Like a glass jaw.

323
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,458
Jelly legs. No stamina.

324
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:13,708
- And most of all...
- Yeah?

325
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,833
I got scared.

326
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:17,541
Some contender.

327
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,750
Do you want another drink in there?

328
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,875
- No. I've had enough.
- Come on.

329
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:23,750
I thought you didn't have any money.

330
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:24,833
I haven't.

331
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:26,833
- Then how are you gonna...
- Relax.

332
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:30,000
I'll think of something. Two more drinks, please.

333
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:33,666
Look, pal, the food counter's closed,
the bar's closed,

334
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,958
my eyes are closing.
In fact, the whole joint's closed.

335
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:39,125
BLOUSEY: I don't want one anyway.

336
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,500
Hello.

337
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:54,041
Hello, operator, could you test this line, please?
I believe we have a fault.

338
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:56,166
It's Columbus 1,

339
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,291
9, 7, 8, 5.

340
00:22:58,375 --> 00:22:59,791
I'll call you right back.

341
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:01,375
Thank you.

342
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:07,166
How much do I owe you?

343
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:10,125
Eight banana boozer specials
with double ice cream.

344
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:15,083
Three beef spitfires, two cream
Arizona doughnuts and a salami special.

345
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:17,250
Four dollars and 80 cents.

346
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:20,333
(Phone rings)

347
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:22,125
Excuse me.

348
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,791
Hello.

349
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,916
Let me out of here!

350
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,041
Let me out!

351
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:36,208
Come back!

352
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:52,416
Extra, extra! Read all about it!
"New Weapon Revealed." Read all about it!

353
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,750
We interrupt your commentary
on tonight's exciting ball game

354
00:23:55,875 --> 00:24:00,708
to bring you a further bulletin of developments
in the latest outbreak of hoodlum gang warfare.

355
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:05,708
Police now officially state that the new weapon
of devious foreign manufacture,

356
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:09,333
known as the splurge gun,
is now being widely used by the mobster gangs.

357
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:14,208
We interrupt our interruption to go
straight over to our reporter Seymour Scoop.

358
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:18,916
(Animated reports in different languages)

359
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,083
(Reports overlap)

360
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,708
This time, gangs have gone too far.

361
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:43,208
And what's more, what I have to tell you
is certainly not cricket.

362
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:01,041
# String quartet plays

363
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,833
There's a Mr. Bronx Charlie and company
to see you, sir.

364
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:47,750
I'll be right in after I get changed.

365
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:50,833
- Show them into the conservatory, Johnson.
- Very good, sir.

366
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:53,375
Say, honey, aren't you gonna play no more?

367
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:56,083
Later, my rose. Later.

368
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:01,250
# Velia

369
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:03,791
# Oh, Velia

370
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:09,083
# The witch of the wood

371
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:16,583
# Would I not die for you, dear?

372
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:18,750
# If I could

373
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:22,625
# Velia, oh, Velia -

374
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:24,750
OK, next.

375
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,875
Very nice. Yeah, it was lovely.

376
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:29,583
- Next. Get off.
- Can you get off the stage?

377
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:31,541
Don't give up your day job, OK?

378
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:34,666
I didn't figure on this many people.

379
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,416
They're all jugglers and magicians
by the look of it.

380
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,458
Don't worry. You've got no competition.
You'll walk it.

381
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:42,083
Come on. Hurry it up.

382
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:44,458
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

383
00:26:44,541 --> 00:26:47,875
I'm very proud to be here.
In fact, I'm very lucky to be here.

384
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:50,416
Because as I was walking along the sidewalk...

385
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,708
How do I look?

386
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:53,000
Fine.

387
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:54,500
I look terrible.

388
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:56,000
Believe me, you look swell.

389
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:57,708
- Honest?
- Honest.

390
00:26:57,791 --> 00:27:01,125
- Cross your heart?
- Cross my heart. You look beautiful.

391
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:04,250
Next.

392
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,333
# Once I built a railroad

393
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,708
No, not that old chestnut again?

394
00:27:10,791 --> 00:27:12,833
Let's get him off. Next.

395
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:15,708
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

396
00:27:15,791 --> 00:27:19,000
I suppose you're wondering why we're here.

397
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:21,166
- You bet.
- Next.

398
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,916
Not one rabbit. Not two rabbits.

399
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,041
But three rabbits.

400
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:28,583
Next, next, next.

401
00:27:29,666 --> 00:27:31,750
Next.

402
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:45,458
Yeah, great, OK.

403
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:47,583
Next!

404
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,708
Just get up there.

405
00:27:49,791 --> 00:27:52,041
Come on, now. Next.

406
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,333
Blousey Brown. Singer.

407
00:28:05,958 --> 00:28:07,583
She's pretty.

408
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:11,000
Great face, yeah. Could do a lot with that face.

409
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,750
Oscar!

410
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:15,750
Oscar, Oscar!

411
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:19,541
Oscar, I'm back. I'll give you one more chance,
you hear me?

412
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:21,791
OSCAR: Lena, honey, you've come back to me.

413
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:23,875
LENA: I'll give you one more chance.

414
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:26,000
Otherwise, I'm out for good.

415
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:27,916
Out, out, out!

416
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,250
I'm not being humiliated in this place.

417
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,875
You know, I am the star
and I should be treated like that all the time.

418
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:36,000
OK, hit it, Joe.

419
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:38,166
(Piano intro)

420
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:43,458
# Show business, it's in my veins

421
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:46,291
# Gotta keep singing that old refrain

422
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:48,916
# I thrill to all the tunes
that make me want to dance

423
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,833
Cheer up. There's a million other jobs.

424
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:54,333
Sure, buster. Standing on a street corner
with a hat to catch the dimes in.

425
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:56,041
It's only a matter of time.

426
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:57,625
Just cool down.

427
00:28:57,708 --> 00:29:00,666
Look, buster, I've walked the streets of New York
for six months

428
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:04,291
and the only fancy steps I've done
is to avoid the man who collects the rent.

429
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:07,916
So, it takes time to be a movie star.
We can always come back tomorrow.

430
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,750
"Come back tomorrow!"
I spend my whole life coming back tomorrow!

431
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,916
Knock it off, Blousey. Cool down, will you?

432
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,833
- I will not cool down! I will not!
- Now, don't be stupid!

433
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:18,750
Will you be quiet up there?

434
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:20,875
I'm rehearsing.

435
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:23,000
BLOUSEY: I'm sorry.

436
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:24,958
Don't worry.

437
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:27,083
There's always Fat Sam's place.

438
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:29,208
- He won't see me.
- I'll talk to him.

439
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:31,750
- You know him?
- Know him? We're like that.

440
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:33,875
You're real good friends?

441
00:29:33,958 --> 00:29:38,000
No, it's just that when I talk to him,
I cross my fingers he won't hit me.

442
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:40,125
Come on. Let's get out of here.

443
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:42,041
You're too good for the show, anyway.

444
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:44,583
Why don't we try Fat Sam's place, anyway?

445
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:46,708
You gotta be kidding.

446
00:29:46,791 --> 00:29:52,416
# That show business is my business now!

447
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:03,083
- Hi, boys.
ALL: Hi, Boss.

448
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:04,500
OK, relax.

449
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:07,000
Relax, will ya?

450
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:10,541
Well, guys,

451
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:14,041
I'd like to take this opportunity
of thanking you for your work so far.

452
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:15,875
Everything's gone swell.

453
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:18,291
- Just swell.
- Gee. Thanks, Boss.

454
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:20,875
ALL: Thanks, Boss.

455
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:23,000
Fat Sam must have had quite a shock.

456
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:24,500
Thanks, Boss.

457
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:26,125
Thanks, Boss.

458
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:28,041
Thanks, Boss.

459
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:30,041
Laughing Boy.

460
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:32,791
Yonkers.

461
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:34,291
Shoulders.

462
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:35,791
Bronx Charlie.

463
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,291
Benny Lee.

464
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:41,250
Any moment now, Fat Sam
will be crawling on his knees to me.

465
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:42,958
ALL: On his knees.

466
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,083
Where's my flower, Boss?

467
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:48,416
Soon, all Fat Sam will have
is the suit he stands up in

468
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,541
and a suitcase full of memories.

469
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:53,000
I don't have a flower, Boss.

470
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:12,166
What'd I do, Boss?

471
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,500
You goofed, Doodle. You dropped a gun.

472
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:17,000
And I don't allow mistakes in this outfit.

473
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,083
Cos mistakes put us all in the caboose.

474
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:22,208
And Sing Sing ain't my style.

475
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:24,291
No, Boss, not that. Anything but that.

476
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:27,041
I didn't mean to drop the gun.
It slipped out of my hand.

477
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:29,458
Button your lip, Doodle. You're all washed up.

478
00:31:29,541 --> 00:31:30,875
Boss, give a guy a break.

479
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:32,291
Get him!

480
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:42,416
DANDY DAN: And now, my friends,
listen to what I'm telling you. And listen good.

481
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,375
There's only room for one Mr. Big in this town.

482
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:47,041
And that's me. Dandy Dan.

483
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:50,416
And, fellas,
the time has come for us to play our next card.

484
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:56,000
And believe yous me, Fat Sam and
his dumb bums ain't gonna stand in our way.

485
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:59,875
# We coulda been
anything that we wanted to be

486
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:04,208
# But don't it make your heart glad?

487
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:07,500
# That we decided

488
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:09,625
# A fact we take pride in

489
00:32:09,708 --> 00:32:12,833
# We became the best at being bad

490
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:18,333
# We coulda been
anything that we wanted to be

491
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:21,750
# With all the talent we had

492
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:25,166
# No doubt about it

493
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:28,250
# We whine and we pout it

494
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:31,708
# We're the very best at being bad guys

495
00:32:31,791 --> 00:32:33,666
# We're rotten to the core

496
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:36,750
# My congratulations

497
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:38,875
# No-one likes you any more

498
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:41,000
# Bad guys

499
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:42,750
# We're the very worst

500
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:47,791
# Each of us contemptible,
we're criticized and cursed

501
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:52,125
# We made the big time, malicious and mad

502
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:55,916
# We're the very best at being bad

503
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,083
Look at me. I'm dancing!

504
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:02,875
# We coulda been
anything that we wanted to be

505
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:07,000
# We took the easy way out

506
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:12,041
# With little training, we mastered complaining

507
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:14,375
# Manners seemed unnecessary

508
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:17,166
# We're so rude, it's almost scary

509
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:20,916
# We coulda been
anything that we wanted to be

510
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,458
# With all the talent we had

511
00:33:26,416 --> 00:33:30,208
# With little practice, we made every blacklist

512
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:33,375
# We're the very best at being bad

513
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:37,166
# We're the very best at being bad

514
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,250
Why are you shovin' me?

515
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:42,458
# We're the very best at being bad

516
00:33:59,125 --> 00:34:00,541
Hey.

517
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:02,250
What do you guys think you're doing?

518
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:04,458
Get in here, you bunch of peanut brains!

519
00:34:04,541 --> 00:34:06,666
Get in here, you dummies!

520
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:10,000
Come on. We've got business to do.
Move it. Get in here.

521
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:20,541
Come on, you guys. Get in here.

522
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,791
We got business to do.

523
00:34:22,875 --> 00:34:24,416
We can't waste all this time.

524
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,541
Right.

525
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:29,125
Let's get down to it. Don't do that, Snake Eyes!

526
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:30,916
It's thinking time.

527
00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:34,875
- And don't do that, Knuckles.
- Sure thing, Boss.

528
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:38,875
Let's start at the beginning. We're being
outsmarted by that lounge lizard, right?

529
00:34:38,958 --> 00:34:40,083
ALL: Right.

530
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:43,625
- We've got to get back on top, right?
ALL: Right back on top, Boss.

531
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:46,333
We'll kick that drugstore cowboy right into line.

532
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:48,166
ALL: You bet, Boss.

533
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:52,250
Sure, we've been a little slow off the mark.
But dumb bums, we ain't.

534
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:55,125
ALL: No, dumb bums, we ain't.

535
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:57,291
Hand me a pie.

536
00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:02,750
Louis, over there into the corner.

537
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:04,000
Me, Boss?

538
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:05,916
Why me, Boss?

539
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,333
Louis, into the corner.

540
00:35:07,416 --> 00:35:08,875
What'd I do, Boss?

541
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:11,416
Nothing, Louis.

542
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,333
You see? Missed. OK, Louis.

543
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:16,875
You can sit down now.

544
00:35:16,958 --> 00:35:19,500
Even a dumb mug like Louis is too quick for us.

545
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:22,708
That's the root of our troubles.
We're behind the times.

546
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:24,333
I don't get it, Boss.

547
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:28,666
We ain't never gonna get back on top
with this kind of hardware, Knuckles.

548
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:33,875
It's old-fashioned.
In short, we've got to get ourselves that gun.

549
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:36,583
(Phone rings)

550
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:38,458
Hello.

551
00:35:38,541 --> 00:35:41,291
- Do you want some information?
- Start giving.

552
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:45,666
Yeah. OK, thanks.

553
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:51,833
We've had ourselves a little break.

554
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:55,166
Who knows
the Hung Fu Shin laundry company?

555
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:59,708
Well, our friend on the telephone here
says that's where they stash the guns.

556
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:02,083
Right. Get moving!

557
00:36:03,166 --> 00:36:05,541
Not you, Knuckles. You stay here with me.

558
00:36:05,625 --> 00:36:07,583
Sure, Boss.

559
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:19,875
(Bones crack)

560
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:23,541
Oh. What?

561
00:37:24,583 --> 00:37:26,416
I don't believe it!

562
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,333
The whole gang?

563
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:31,291
Everybody?

564
00:37:36,416 --> 00:37:39,750
That leaves just you and me, Knuckles.
We're on our own.

565
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:41,500
What are we gonna do, Boss?

566
00:37:41,583 --> 00:37:44,750
Don't do that!
How many times do I have to tell you?

567
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:48,583
Do nothing. Act like everything is normal.

568
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,708
Come tutte cose sono buone.

569
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:52,333
What does that mean, Boss?

570
00:37:52,416 --> 00:37:54,166
You can't speak Italian?

571
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,833
No, Boss, I'm Jewish.

572
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:57,750
Then read the translations!

573
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:00,958
Oh, all this is good.

574
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:24,291
- Hey, Fizzy.
- Hey, Bugsy.

575
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:26,166
Still practicing?

576
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,291
Still practicing.

577
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,625
Suddenly
everybody wants to be in show business.

578
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:36,833
Hi, Tallulah, I've come to see Fat Sam.

579
00:38:36,916 --> 00:38:38,958
- Is he in?
- No, he's busy, Bugsy.

580
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:41,000
Hi, Bugsy.

581
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:42,375
Hi.

582
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:44,708
Why don't you have a drink while you're waiting?

583
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:48,916
Yeah. Why not?

584
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:53,208
OK, girls, go feed the ducks, will you?

585
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:54,916
ALL: Oh, Tallulah!

586
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,666
I said, beat it.

587
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:06,416
Long time no see, Bugsy.

588
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:09,083
Well, you know how it is.

589
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:10,375
Yeah.

590
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:14,333
You used to come and see me every night.

591
00:39:14,416 --> 00:39:16,041
I've been busy.

592
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:17,750
Oh, yeah? Busy doing what?

593
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:19,208
Oh, this and that.

594
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:20,708
(Crashed chords)

595
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:25,416
Hey, Fizzy, will you cut the ivory
and hit the shoe leather?

596
00:39:27,541 --> 00:39:29,875
Yes, ma'am.

597
00:39:34,916 --> 00:39:37,041
You know you're aces, Bugsy.

598
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:40,750
I've always found you kinda special.

599
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:42,958
Careful. You're racing my motor.

600
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:45,708
Oh, come on, Bugsy, give a girl a break.

601
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:47,916
Are you sure you got the right fella?

602
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,958
You're not like all those other saps.

603
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:52,083
- No?
- No.

604
00:39:52,166 --> 00:39:54,416
You've got lovely brown eyes.

605
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,416
They'll be lovely black eyes
if Fat Sam catches us.

606
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,458
How about smearing my lipstick?

607
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:03,625
Careful, Tallulah.

608
00:40:03,708 --> 00:40:06,333
If you come any closer,
I'll have to call my lawyer.

609
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:08,833
So, call him.

610
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:19,791
Blousey.

611
00:40:20,833 --> 00:40:22,958
Blousey!

612
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:24,666
Blousey.

613
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,750
It's the broad about the audition, Boss.

614
00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:35,666
He's busy, lady. Come back tomorrow, huh?

615
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:39,208
No, no, no, no. OK, honey, I'm all ears.
I'll be with you in a minute.

616
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,791
Carry on as normal, remember?
Don't let 'em know we're beat.

617
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:46,791
- Business as usual, right?
- Right.

618
00:40:46,875 --> 00:40:48,833
- Calm and collected, right?
- Right.

619
00:40:48,916 --> 00:40:51,875
This way, they don't know we're scared.
I mean, concerned.

620
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:53,875
Sure, Boss.

621
00:40:55,958 --> 00:40:58,041
(Piano intro)

622
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:09,125
# I'm feeling fine

623
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:13,458
# Filled with emotions

624
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:16,625
# Stronger than wine

625
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:19,375
# They give me the notion

626
00:41:19,458 --> 00:41:23,291
# That this strange new feeling

627
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:32,041
# Is something that you're feeling too

628
00:41:33,333 --> 00:41:35,250
# Matter of fact

629
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:40,083
# I'm forced to admit it

630
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:43,000
# Caught in the act

631
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,750
# And maybe we've hit it

632
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:52,333
# Is this strange new feeling
something that you're feeling...

633
00:41:52,416 --> 00:41:54,916
FAT SAM:
OK, honey, that's enough. That's enough.

634
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,833
A little contemporary for my taste,

635
00:41:56,916 --> 00:41:58,750
but very nice.

636
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:00,375
You're hired.

637
00:42:01,416 --> 00:42:07,833
# ..too?

638
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,750
BUGSY: That was great.
It really was, Blousey. It was terrific.

639
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,083
Blousey.

640
00:42:19,166 --> 00:42:21,208
Blousey, come back, will you?

641
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:23,333
Aw, what's the use?

642
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:25,500
Sorry, Tallulah, I've got to go.

643
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:29,208
(Car horn blares)

644
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:34,208
Blousey!

645
00:42:34,291 --> 00:42:36,333
Where is she?

646
00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:38,500
Blousey!

647
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:08,250
The show's going swell, Boss.

648
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:10,708
Good. That's just the way I wanted it to be.

649
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:13,375
Tutte cose sono lo stesso, ricordare?

650
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:16,291
Same number of drinks, same everything.

651
00:43:16,375 --> 00:43:18,666
Can't let 'em know they got us on the run.

652
00:43:20,791 --> 00:43:23,333
Come here. I've got to show you something.

653
00:43:23,416 --> 00:43:28,000
Knuckles, I've sent for someone
to help us out of our little predicament.

654
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:30,125
No ten-cent dummy. A specialist.

655
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:32,250
A doctor?

656
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:34,375
Not a doctor, you bilberry.

657
00:43:34,458 --> 00:43:36,083
A hoodlum.

658
00:43:36,166 --> 00:43:38,000
I thought we were hoodlums, Boss.

659
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:40,750
Not a dumb bum, Knuckles.
This guy is the real McCoy.

660
00:43:40,833 --> 00:43:43,250
Not Looney Bergonzi.

661
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:45,375
- The Looney Bergonzi?
- Yes.

662
00:43:45,458 --> 00:43:48,833
The very same Looney, off his trolley,
mad as a hatter, Bergonzi.

663
00:43:48,916 --> 00:43:50,750
The best man in Chicago.

664
00:43:50,833 --> 00:43:54,208
Here's what we do. We arrange ourselves
a meeting with Dandy Dan.

665
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:56,416
Looney hides in the back seat with me.

666
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,041
- You drive, right?
- Right.

667
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:01,875
But I don't drive, Boss.

668
00:44:01,958 --> 00:44:05,708
You what? Cretino! You don't drive?

669
00:44:05,791 --> 00:44:07,208
Right.

670
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:09,291
We get ourselves a driver.

671
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:19,041
- Oh, hi, Bugsy.
- Hi, Bangles. Is Blousey there, please?

672
00:44:19,125 --> 00:44:20,541
She won't see you.

673
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:22,541
- Tell her I'm sick.
- You're sick?

674
00:44:22,625 --> 00:44:24,083
Yeah. Sick of waiting.

675
00:44:27,333 --> 00:44:28,958
Beat it, wisey.

676
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,875
Give a guy a break, will you, Blousey?

677
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:33,166
I've bought you some flowers.

678
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:35,041
I'll see that Tallulah gets them.

679
00:44:35,125 --> 00:44:37,083
Quit being so smart. They're for you.

680
00:44:37,166 --> 00:44:39,166
- Five minutes, girls.
- I have to go.

681
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:43,208
- I was thinking of getting a job.
- You don't get paid for standing in breadlines.

682
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:45,250
A legit job. We could save some money.

683
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:47,833
Enough for a ticket to the coast and Hollywood.

684
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:50,291
Sure, sure. I'll believe it when I see it.

685
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:53,833
Hey, Bugsy, do you drive?

686
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:55,208
Sure. Why?

687
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:59,041
- How'd you like to earn some green stuff?
- As long as you don't mean cabbages.

688
00:44:59,125 --> 00:45:02,625
Step inside.
I've got a little proposition to make to you.

689
00:45:02,708 --> 00:45:04,750
Flowers! For me?

690
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:06,875
How nice. Grazie, amico.

691
00:45:06,958 --> 00:45:09,041
Knuckles, put these in some water.

692
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:12,666
(String quartet plays)

693
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,833
(Phone rings)

694
00:45:19,541 --> 00:45:21,166
Hello.

695
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:23,291
Yes.

696
00:45:23,375 --> 00:45:25,416
Who shall I say is calling?

697
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,583
One moment, please.

698
00:45:56,791 --> 00:45:58,166
Hello.

699
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:00,125
Dandy Dan, is that you?

700
00:46:00,208 --> 00:46:02,041
This is Dandy Dan speaking.

701
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:03,750
I want to arrange a meeting.

702
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:05,458
Yeah, I'll meet you. Where?

703
00:46:05,541 --> 00:46:07,166
Out of town, OK?

704
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:09,708
Agreed. Just you and a driver, understand?

705
00:46:09,791 --> 00:46:11,208
When?

706
00:46:11,291 --> 00:46:13,333
Monday, 11 am.

707
00:46:13,416 --> 00:46:15,041
Right. I'll be there.

708
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:17,000
Got him, the knucklehead.

709
00:46:17,083 --> 00:46:19,125
Got him, the salami.

710
00:46:19,208 --> 00:46:22,083
OK, Knuckles, let's go and enjoy the show.

711
00:46:31,916 --> 00:46:33,958
# My name is Tallulah

712
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,500
# My first rule of thumb

713
00:46:36,583 --> 00:46:39,000
# I don't say where I'm going

714
00:46:39,083 --> 00:46:41,500
# Or where I'm coming from

715
00:46:41,583 --> 00:46:46,875
# I try to leave a little reputation behind me

716
00:46:46,958 --> 00:46:49,000
# So if you really need to

717
00:46:49,083 --> 00:46:51,166
# You know how to find me

718
00:47:00,791 --> 00:47:03,041
# My name is Tallulah

719
00:47:03,125 --> 00:47:04,875
# I live till I die

720
00:47:04,958 --> 00:47:07,000
# I'll take what you give me

721
00:47:07,083 --> 00:47:09,958
# And I won't ask why

722
00:47:10,375 --> 00:47:14,083
# I've made a lot of friends in some exotic places

723
00:47:14,166 --> 00:47:16,416
# I don't remember names

724
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,958
# But I remember faces

725
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:32,291
# Lonely

726
00:47:32,375 --> 00:47:36,875
# You don't have to be lonely

727
00:47:38,958 --> 00:47:41,291
# Come and see Tallulah

728
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:45,291
# We can chase your troubles away

729
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:47,041
# Oh...

730
00:47:48,083 --> 00:47:49,791
# If you're lonely

731
00:47:51,208 --> 00:47:53,041
# You don't have to be

732
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:56,166
# Lonely

733
00:47:57,208 --> 00:48:00,000
# When they talk about Tallulah

734
00:48:00,083 --> 00:48:02,750
# You know what they say

735
00:48:02,833 --> 00:48:07,291
# No-one south of heaven's
gonna treat you finer

736
00:48:07,375 --> 00:48:12,208
# Tallulah had her training in North Carolina

737
00:48:20,708 --> 00:48:22,541
# My name is Tallulah

738
00:48:22,625 --> 00:48:26,125
# And soon I'll be gone

739
00:48:26,208 --> 00:48:30,750
# An open invitation is the road I'll travel on

740
00:48:30,833 --> 00:48:35,625
# I never say goodbye,
because the words upset me

741
00:48:35,708 --> 00:48:38,208
# You may forgive my going

742
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:41,000
# But you won't forget me

743
00:48:50,083 --> 00:48:53,000
# Lonely

744
00:48:53,083 --> 00:48:57,583
# You don't have to be lonely

745
00:48:59,666 --> 00:49:01,916
# Come and see Tallulah

746
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,625
# We can chase your troubles away

747
00:49:08,958 --> 00:49:11,875
# If you're lonely

748
00:49:11,958 --> 00:49:16,458
# You don't have to be lonely

749
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,666
# When they talk about Tallulah

750
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:23,125
# You know what they say

751
00:49:23,208 --> 00:49:27,666
# No-one south of heaven's
gonna treat you finer

752
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:32,833
# Tallulah had her training in North Carolina

753
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:41,125
(Cheering)

754
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:42,666
(Whistling)

755
00:49:51,416 --> 00:49:53,500
(Birdsong)

756
00:50:16,416 --> 00:50:17,916
They're coming.

757
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,041
OK, Looney. Keep your head down.

758
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:43,500
What can I do for you, Sam?

759
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,958
How about a small dose of straight talk, Dan?

760
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:48,500
- Suits me.
- You've been taking liberties.

761
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:51,625
- I've been taking what's mine.
- Trouble is, it belongs to me.

762
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:52,916
Too bad.

763
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,583
Er, I'm sure we can talk this over sensibly.
I'm a businessman.

764
00:50:56,666 --> 00:50:58,875
You're a dime-a-dozen gangster, Sam.

765
00:50:58,958 --> 00:51:02,125
Button your lip! You don't talk dirty to me.
I don't like your mouth.

766
00:51:02,208 --> 00:51:04,041
I have to have some respect, you know.

767
00:51:04,125 --> 00:51:06,916
You'd slit your own throat for two bits plus tax.

768
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,041
Keep your wisecracks behind your teeth.

769
00:51:10,125 --> 00:51:11,291
Keep talking.

770
00:51:11,375 --> 00:51:13,541
Er, I have my position to think of.

771
00:51:13,625 --> 00:51:15,916
Right now, it's not worth a plug nickel.

772
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,041
You're a dirty rat, Dan.

773
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:20,416
You've been watching too many movies, Sam.

774
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,750
Looney, let him have it!

775
00:51:22,666 --> 00:51:24,666
Charlie, Yonkers, it's a double-cross!

776
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,916
OK, yous guys. Freeze.

777
00:51:35,208 --> 00:51:37,125
Looney!

778
00:51:38,541 --> 00:51:40,583
Looney, what's the matter with you?

779
00:51:40,666 --> 00:51:42,541
(Splurge-fire continues)

780
00:51:49,541 --> 00:51:51,958
(Whistles) Hey, you guys!

781
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:54,291
Over here! Over here!

782
00:51:57,375 --> 00:52:00,916
Come back, you dummies. They're getting away.
Come back here, will ya?

783
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,291
Come on, come on, come on!

784
00:52:03,375 --> 00:52:05,791
Come on. Go. Go. Step on it. Go! Go!

785
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:08,958
Come on. Step on it!

786
00:52:18,708 --> 00:52:23,375
FAT SAM: Come on, Bugsy.
We're gonna lose 'em! Drive faster. Come on.

787
00:52:36,541 --> 00:52:38,541
FAT SAM: Dan, you're a rat!

788
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:43,166
Dan, you're a dirty rat!

789
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:44,875
They're gonna get us. Move!

790
00:52:46,416 --> 00:52:47,500
(Klaxon)

791
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,500
Hold tight, Mr. Stacetto.

792
00:52:56,583 --> 00:52:57,666
(Cows moo)

793
00:53:00,708 --> 00:53:02,625
Get out!

794
00:53:17,666 --> 00:53:18,916
(Klaxon)

795
00:53:20,208 --> 00:53:22,291
Come on, Malone!

796
00:53:23,041 --> 00:53:26,458
You're a dirty double-crossing rat, Dandy Dan.

797
00:53:28,416 --> 00:53:30,541
FAT SAM: Turn, Bugsy. Hard!

798
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:35,291
DANDY DAN: There's a bridge down there.
Put the brakes on!

799
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:40,708
- Ha, ha! We lost 'em.
- We lost 'em.

800
00:53:44,541 --> 00:53:46,458
Ah, shucks!

801
00:53:46,541 --> 00:53:48,333
Dirty rats!

802
00:53:48,416 --> 00:53:52,333
Get outta here, you dumb clucks.
Go "cock-a-doodle-do" somewhere else.

803
00:53:53,375 --> 00:53:56,166
Here you are, Bugsy.
Treat yourself to a new suit.

804
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:58,750
Get rid of that laundry sack you're wearing.

805
00:53:58,833 --> 00:54:01,500
Why, thanks. Thank you very much, Mr. Stacetto.

806
00:54:01,583 --> 00:54:03,833
Oh, by the way. Here's my tailor's card.

807
00:54:03,916 --> 00:54:06,458
Go see him. You ain't gotta pay for six months.

808
00:54:06,541 --> 00:54:10,291
- Thank you very much.
- Mi piacere. Mi piacere. Think nothing of it.

809
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:12,041
Come on. Let's go.

810
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,125
(Chatter)

811
00:54:19,541 --> 00:54:22,000
Tillie, don't you think I look kinda cute?

812
00:54:22,083 --> 00:54:24,125
I don't know.

813
00:54:24,208 --> 00:54:25,916
Come on, Dotty. What do you think?

814
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,458
I don't know, Bangles.
Maybe the color’s wrong.

815
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:30,291
What are you talking about?

816
00:54:30,375 --> 00:54:32,291
Purple's my color. I always wear purple.

817
00:54:32,375 --> 00:54:33,625
Don't I always wear purple?

818
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:34,916
Yeah. Matches your nose.

819
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,041
DOTTY: Maybe it's the length.

820
00:54:37,125 --> 00:54:39,833
It's the latest length.
I read it in a magazine. Look.

821
00:54:39,916 --> 00:54:42,291
Maybe it's the frills. They stick out too much.

822
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:44,416
LORRETTA: They match your ears.

823
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:47,083
Frills are in. Look at this picture of Lena Marelli.

824
00:54:47,166 --> 00:54:51,541
- Lena Marelli is not Bangles Dobell.
- So? You think it'd look better on you?

825
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:54,333
LORRETTA: It'd look better on a horse.

826
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:57,125
You're just jealous.
My looks are ahead of their time.

827
00:54:57,208 --> 00:54:59,916
- They're what?
BANGLES: Full of character.

828
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,625
- Kinda earthy.
LORRETTA: Yeah, like a bucket of mud.

829
00:55:02,708 --> 00:55:05,083
You creep. Get lost!

830
00:55:05,166 --> 00:55:07,250
(Giggling)

831
00:55:09,625 --> 00:55:12,708
How about you, Blousey?
Do you think I look terrible?

832
00:55:14,166 --> 00:55:18,375
You tell me, Blousey.
Do I look cute or do I look terrible?

833
00:55:21,166 --> 00:55:22,583
Honestly?

834
00:55:22,666 --> 00:55:24,750
Bangles Dobell,

835
00:55:24,833 --> 00:55:26,916
you look terrible.

836
00:55:28,041 --> 00:55:30,083
What are you looking at, anyway?

837
00:55:30,166 --> 00:55:32,166
Nothing.

838
00:55:46,541 --> 00:55:48,750
(Soundless)

839
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,583
VELMA: Blousey.

840
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:18,708
VELMA: Blousey.

841
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,625
VELMA: Blousey.

842
00:56:28,708 --> 00:56:30,375
It's for you. It's Bugsy.

843
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:35,625
Give him my love.

844
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:38,083
Thanks.

845
00:56:38,166 --> 00:56:39,166
Hello.

846
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:41,291
Hello, Blousey. It's Bugsy.

847
00:56:41,375 --> 00:56:43,208
- Where are you?
- Just around.

848
00:56:43,291 --> 00:56:46,416
Look, I can't talk now,
but I just made myself 200 bucks.

849
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,125
You mean, you printed it yourself?

850
00:56:48,208 --> 00:56:49,708
No, I earned it.

851
00:56:49,791 --> 00:56:51,625
- Doing what?
- Oh, this and that.

852
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:53,458
(Train rattles)
- Hang on a minute.

853
00:56:53,541 --> 00:56:56,791
- I can't hear you.
- One second. There's a train going by.

854
00:56:57,833 --> 00:56:59,041
Who gave you the money?

855
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:00,916
Fat Sam.

856
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Fat Sam gave you $200?!

857
00:57:03,083 --> 00:57:05,416
And the loan of his sedan for the afternoon.

858
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,250
Fat Sam loaned you his sedan?

859
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:09,500
I don't believe it. You're putting me on.

860
00:57:12,041 --> 00:57:13,708
I believe you.

861
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:17,333
# He's a sinner

862
00:57:18,458 --> 00:57:21,000
# Candy-coated

863
00:57:21,083 --> 00:57:25,791
# For all his friends,
he always seems to be alone

864
00:57:26,916 --> 00:57:28,875
# But they love him

865
00:57:29,916 --> 00:57:31,791
# Bugsy Malone

866
00:57:37,166 --> 00:57:39,041
# A city slicker

867
00:57:40,083 --> 00:57:45,541
# He can charm you
with a smile and a style all his own

868
00:57:47,708 --> 00:57:50,791
# Everybody loves that man

869
00:57:50,875 --> 00:57:54,458
# Bugsy Malone

870
00:58:00,541 --> 00:58:05,166
# Hot-headed Bugsy makes his mind up

871
00:58:06,208 --> 00:58:09,708
# Don't mess with Bugsy or you'll wind up

872
00:58:11,166 --> 00:58:14,916
# Wishing you'd left well enough alone

873
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:19,625
# He's a man, a mountain, he's a rolling stone

874
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:26,666
# And will he leave you, sad and lonely, crying?

875
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:28,791
# I couldn't say

876
00:58:28,875 --> 00:58:30,958
# But it's known

877
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,583
# That everybody wants that man

878
00:58:35,666 --> 00:58:38,791
# Bugsy Malone

879
00:58:45,041 --> 00:58:46,291
(Horn)

880
00:58:49,416 --> 00:58:51,666
Mustard with onions or ketchup without?

881
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:53,375
Mustard with onions.

882
00:58:53,458 --> 00:58:54,958
Oh, and this, too.

883
00:58:55,041 --> 00:58:56,541
- What's this?
- A present.

884
00:58:56,625 --> 00:58:58,125
- A present?
- Open it up.

885
00:58:58,208 --> 00:59:00,666
- You gotta be kidding.
- I don't kid around, do I?

886
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:03,000
Oh, Bugsy, it's beautiful.

887
00:59:03,083 --> 00:59:05,333
- Nice, huh?
- What is it?

888
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:07,250
What is it? It's a viewer.

889
00:59:07,333 --> 00:59:09,250
Here. Put your eyes in there.

890
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:12,750
- Pictures of all the Hollywood movie stars.
- Oh, Bugsy!

891
00:59:12,833 --> 00:59:15,458
It's fantastic. It really is.

892
00:59:15,541 --> 00:59:18,750
- If only I could really get to Hollywood.
- You can.

893
00:59:18,833 --> 00:59:22,500
Sure, wisey. I know.
In the front row of the Roxy Theater

894
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:25,583
- on East 38th Street.
- No. Really get to Hollywood.

895
00:59:25,666 --> 00:59:28,333
- Keep talking.
- $1 .80 for the viewer, right?

896
00:59:28,416 --> 00:59:30,625
Ten cents for the hotdogs, right?

897
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:34,541
- That leaves 198 dollars and ten red cents for...
- Surprise me.

898
00:59:34,625 --> 00:59:36,458
- Two tickets.
- Two tickets?

899
00:59:36,541 --> 00:59:38,291
How many tickets do you need?

900
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:40,541
- To the ball game?
- To Hollywood, dummy.

901
00:59:41,541 --> 00:59:44,333
Oh, Bugsy! That's really, really great.

902
00:59:44,416 --> 00:59:46,875
- Knock it off, will you?
- You're putting me on.

903
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:48,333
It's the honest truth.

904
00:59:48,416 --> 00:59:50,166
I'm picking 'em up tomorrow.

905
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:52,750
Now I'd better drop you off
and get Fat Sam's car back,

906
00:59:52,833 --> 00:59:54,458
or else I'm not going anywhere.

907
01:00:17,458 --> 01:00:19,541
(Train hooter)

908
01:00:24,083 --> 01:00:25,541
(Groaning)

909
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:32,750
Ah. Ah.

910
01:00:33,833 --> 01:00:35,875
Is anyone in there?

911
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:40,083
BUGSY: Hello?

912
01:00:41,166 --> 01:00:42,458
Are you hurt?

913
01:00:45,791 --> 01:00:47,791
BUGSY: Somebody help me! Ow!

914
01:00:49,083 --> 01:00:51,833
Help me, please! Somebody, help!

915
01:00:52,875 --> 01:00:54,208
Please!

916
01:01:07,958 --> 01:01:10,041
They take your money, mister?

917
01:01:13,375 --> 01:01:15,208
Yeah, nearly 200 dollars.

918
01:01:15,291 --> 01:01:18,208
Thanks, anyway.
It was nice of you to help me like that.

919
01:01:18,291 --> 01:01:19,666
It was nothing.

920
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:22,333
- You must be a boxer, right?
- No.

921
01:01:22,416 --> 01:01:24,458
- You're not?
- No.

922
01:01:24,541 --> 01:01:26,791
But that's the best punching I ever saw.

923
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:29,125
- You ever been coached?
- No.

924
01:01:29,208 --> 01:01:31,625
- Ever thought of taking it up?
- No.

925
01:01:31,708 --> 01:01:35,291
- Why not? You could be a champion.
- I never had the chance.

926
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:37,416
I know someone who could help you.

927
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,541
- You know Cagey Joe?
- No.

928
01:01:39,625 --> 01:01:41,125
You must know Slugger's Gym?

929
01:01:41,208 --> 01:01:42,708
No.

930
01:01:42,791 --> 01:01:44,583
You don't know much, do you?

931
01:01:44,666 --> 01:01:46,166
Nope.

932
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:47,458
What's your name, anyway?

933
01:01:47,541 --> 01:01:49,500
Er, Smith. Leroy Smith.

934
01:01:49,583 --> 01:01:52,083
I'm Bugsy Malone. Put it there, Leroy.

935
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:54,000
You got yourself a manager.

936
01:01:54,083 --> 01:01:57,000
You know what the first thing
I'm gonna do with you is?

937
01:01:57,083 --> 01:01:58,083
No.

938
01:01:58,166 --> 01:02:00,416
I'm gonna treat you to one heck of a meal.

939
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:03,750
- I thought they took your dough, man.
- Who needs dough?

940
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,583
(Bubbling)

941
01:02:20,125 --> 01:02:21,791
Aaaah!

942
01:02:27,791 --> 01:02:29,458
(Bottles smash)

943
01:02:47,625 --> 01:02:49,083
(Siren)

944
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:09,375
Aha! Come and take a look at this, O'Dreary.

945
01:03:11,458 --> 01:03:13,875
You've cracked it this time, Captain Smolsky.

946
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:16,041
SMOLSKY: Get the plaster. We'll take a mould.

947
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:18,208
Come on. Let's get some plaster.

948
01:03:18,291 --> 01:03:19,791
Now, be careful, now.

949
01:03:19,875 --> 01:03:21,375
Up a bit. Up a bit.

950
01:03:21,458 --> 01:03:22,666
That's it.

951
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:24,250
Left a bit. Left a bit.

952
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:25,791
Be careful, now.

953
01:03:25,875 --> 01:03:27,166
That's good.

954
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:28,375
Come on. Hurry up.

955
01:03:28,458 --> 01:03:30,708
Hold it straight. Now, be careful. Be careful.

956
01:03:38,375 --> 01:03:39,875
You idiot!

957
01:03:39,958 --> 01:03:41,416
(Rings)

958
01:03:42,833 --> 01:03:44,458
Hello. What?

959
01:03:44,541 --> 01:03:48,250
It's no good, Boss.
They've got to the still. The whole lot's gone.

960
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:50,375
Not the sarsaparilla racket as well?

961
01:03:50,458 --> 01:03:52,125
Get round here right away.

962
01:03:52,208 --> 01:03:53,875
- I can't, Boss.
- Why not?

963
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:55,458
I'm all tied up.

964
01:03:55,541 --> 01:03:58,041
I don't care how busy you are!
Get here right away.

965
01:03:59,083 --> 01:04:01,250
Careful, you idiots!

966
01:04:02,291 --> 01:04:03,291
No!

967
01:04:03,375 --> 01:04:05,791
- O'Dreary!
- Don't worry, Captain Smolsky.

968
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:08,750
We'll break you out
when we get back to Headquarters.

969
01:04:08,833 --> 01:04:09,875
Argh!

970
01:04:20,833 --> 01:04:24,750
- Hiya, Bugsy. How you been, man?
- Swell, Cagey Joe. Just swell.

971
01:04:24,833 --> 01:04:27,875
I'd like you to meet
the next heavyweight champion.

972
01:04:27,958 --> 01:04:29,625
Leroy, meet Cagey Joe.

973
01:04:29,708 --> 01:04:31,750
Cagey Joe, this is Leroy Smith.

974
01:04:31,833 --> 01:04:34,791
- You ever been in the ring before, kid?
- No.

975
01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:37,583
- So you wanna be a fighter, huh?
- No.

976
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:39,916
Sure he does. He's a natural.

977
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,875
Look at those fists.
Did you ever see such fists?

978
01:04:42,958 --> 01:04:44,125
Hit it, Leroy.

979
01:04:46,541 --> 01:04:48,666
See what I mean? A born champion.

980
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:50,250
What's your name again, kid?

981
01:04:50,333 --> 01:04:52,458
Er, Smith. Leroy Smith.

982
01:04:52,541 --> 01:04:56,750
With your help, Cagey Joe, showing him
the ropes, he could be a champion in no time.

983
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:10,791
# So you wanna be a boxer in the golden ring?

984
01:05:10,875 --> 01:05:13,833
# Can you punch
like a southbound freight train?

985
01:05:13,916 --> 01:05:15,541
# Tell me just one thing

986
01:05:15,625 --> 01:05:19,125
# Can you move in a word
like a hummingbird's wing, if you need to?

987
01:05:19,208 --> 01:05:20,458
Ooh, that's fast!

988
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:23,958
# Can you bob, can you weave,
can you fake and deceive, when you need to?

989
01:05:25,208 --> 01:05:28,125
# Well, you might as well quit,
if you haven't got it

990
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:33,833
# So you wanna be a boxer?
Can you pass the test?

991
01:05:34,875 --> 01:05:38,166
# I can tell if you've got it in you,
I've trained the best

992
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:42,333
# When you work and you sweat,
and you bet that you train to a buzz saw

993
01:05:42,416 --> 01:05:43,416
ALL: # Zing!

994
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:47,125
# Then you near lose your mind
when you find that your boy has a glass jaw

995
01:05:47,208 --> 01:05:50,958
ALL: # So, you might as well quit,
if you haven't got it

996
01:05:52,833 --> 01:05:54,791
# Put him in the ring, Joe,
look at what you've found

997
01:05:54,875 --> 01:05:57,625
# We can use the fun, Joe, pushing him around

998
01:05:57,708 --> 01:06:01,208
BOXER: # We'll show him the ropes
and destroy his hopes

999
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,291
ALL: # Put him in the ring, Joe

1000
01:06:03,375 --> 01:06:06,083
# Give the guy a chance, let him feel the sting,
Joe, we can make him dance

1001
01:06:06,166 --> 01:06:08,416
BOXER: # We'll pound him to bits

1002
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:12,208
# Then he'll call it quits for sure, Joe

1003
01:06:15,791 --> 01:06:17,833
Come on, Leroy. Come on!

1004
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,750
# So you wanna be a boxer,
wanna be the champ?

1005
01:06:25,791 --> 01:06:28,916
# There's a golden boy inside you,
not a punched-out tramp

1006
01:06:29,041 --> 01:06:33,000
# If you listen and you learn
there's an honor you can earn and defend here

1007
01:06:34,333 --> 01:06:37,583
# When you do see the crown,
you're a king, not a clown, a contender

1008
01:06:37,875 --> 01:06:39,541
# But you might as well quit

1009
01:06:40,541 --> 01:06:42,541
# If you haven't got it

1010
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:45,875
# Put him in the ring, Joe,
something new to punch

1011
01:06:45,958 --> 01:06:48,166
# Let me have a swing, Joe,
then we'll go to lunch

1012
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:49,833
# We'll make it quite swift

1013
01:06:49,916 --> 01:06:52,833
# Then he'll get the drift

1014
01:06:52,916 --> 01:06:55,166
# Put him in the ring, Joe, chicken à la carte

1015
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:57,541
# Let me have a wing, Joe, tearing him apart

1016
01:06:57,625 --> 01:06:59,458
# That chicken will crow

1017
01:06:59,541 --> 01:07:02,833
# Let me have him, Joe

1018
01:07:10,833 --> 01:07:12,916
(Muted cheering)

1019
01:07:19,291 --> 01:07:21,250
(Cheering)

1020
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:22,708
He's got it.

1021
01:07:23,916 --> 01:07:25,708
Are you sure this is gonna work, Boss?

1022
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:28,875
Of course it'll work.
It looks like a splurge gun.

1023
01:07:28,958 --> 01:07:30,500
Doesn't it?

1024
01:07:31,625 --> 01:07:33,250
Well, sort of, Boss.

1025
01:07:33,333 --> 01:07:37,750
Nonsense! Anything Dandy Dan can do,
I can do better. You know that.

1026
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:39,875
All right, Knuckles. Are you ready?

1027
01:07:39,958 --> 01:07:41,250
Ready.

1028
01:07:41,333 --> 01:07:42,625
(Cracks knuckles)

1029
01:07:42,708 --> 01:07:44,750
- Don't do that.
- Sorry, Boss.

1030
01:07:44,833 --> 01:07:46,541
All right. Take aim.

1031
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,166
Ready.

1032
01:07:54,083 --> 01:07:55,375
Set.

1033
01:07:55,458 --> 01:07:57,541
(High-pitched whirring)

1034
01:07:57,625 --> 01:07:58,833
Fire!

1035
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:04,166
Missed!

1036
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:06,916
It's back to the drawing board, Knuckles.

1037
01:08:08,583 --> 01:08:10,000
Knuckles!

1038
01:08:10,083 --> 01:08:11,416
Knuckles, speak to me.

1039
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:14,250
Knuckles, parla con me.
Knuckles, dici una cosa.

1040
01:08:14,333 --> 01:08:17,041
Per piacere. Per piacere dici una cosa.

1041
01:08:17,125 --> 01:08:19,208
(Rants)

1042
01:08:24,958 --> 01:08:27,875
It's all your fault. Do you hear me? Your fault!

1043
01:08:46,375 --> 01:08:47,750
(Phone rings)

1044
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:49,291
FAT SAM: Hello.

1045
01:08:51,166 --> 01:08:53,875
Not the grocery racket, too?

1046
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:56,208
Yeah.

1047
01:08:56,291 --> 01:08:59,583
That's the whole empire gone, honey.
You hear me?

1048
01:08:59,666 --> 01:09:01,250
Everything.

1049
01:09:01,333 --> 01:09:03,291
And they'll be coming here next.

1050
01:09:03,375 --> 01:09:06,750
There's only one thing for it.
You'll have to get him to help me.

1051
01:09:07,791 --> 01:09:09,625
Who? The Lone Ranger?

1052
01:09:09,708 --> 01:09:12,000
No, you dumb dora. Bugsy Malone.

1053
01:09:13,041 --> 01:09:14,416
Call him.

1054
01:09:17,083 --> 01:09:20,916
I'm in trouble, real trouble, and all I've got
for company is a female comedian.

1055
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,666
FAT SAM: I need help. I'm really in bad trouble.

1056
01:09:24,708 --> 01:09:27,583
- Is he there?
- No, there's no answer.

1057
01:09:28,875 --> 01:09:30,916
Then get him to me poysonally.

1058
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,250
Personally?

1059
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:34,916
Poysonally.

1060
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,666
"Poysonally."

1061
01:09:38,875 --> 01:09:40,416
(Sighs)

1062
01:09:41,916 --> 01:09:43,791
So long, lover boy.

1063
01:09:48,875 --> 01:09:50,416
(Blind is rolled down)

1064
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:11,083
I like my men at my feet.

1065
01:10:11,166 --> 01:10:14,416
- What are you doing here, Tallulah?
- I brought you a message.

1066
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,541
What's wrong with the Western Union?

1067
01:10:16,625 --> 01:10:18,666
I thought maybe you'd like the company.

1068
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:22,041
Come on. I'll buy you a drink.

1069
01:10:22,125 --> 01:10:24,916
- Where?
- Er, how about Fat Sam's?

1070
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,458
- Fat Sam's? Won't he be there?
- He sure will.

1071
01:10:28,541 --> 01:10:30,708
Er...maybe I'll stay home.

1072
01:10:30,791 --> 01:10:34,541
Don't flatter yourself, tiger.
He's the one that wants to see you, not me.

1073
01:10:34,625 --> 01:10:38,333
Come on.
Let's go before your suspenders strangle you.

1074
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:41,458
(Hums)

1075
01:10:43,166 --> 01:10:45,208
I'm going to Hollywood.

1076
01:10:45,291 --> 01:10:47,375
(Hums)

1077
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:55,708
(Fizzy whistles)

1078
01:11:00,458 --> 01:11:02,791
Quit whistling, Fizzy. It makes me edgy.

1079
01:11:02,875 --> 01:11:04,416
Yes, Boss.

1080
01:11:05,458 --> 01:11:08,083
- Pour me a double on the rocks.
- Sure, Boss.

1081
01:11:15,333 --> 01:11:17,625
What's so funny, buster? You find me amusing?

1082
01:11:17,708 --> 01:11:21,000
No, Boss. I'm sorry. I wasn't smiling at you.

1083
01:11:21,083 --> 01:11:25,458
- Find my suit funny or something?
- No, Boss. It was your flower.

1084
01:11:27,208 --> 01:11:29,458
Oh, yeah. It is kinda droopy, ain't it?

1085
01:11:29,541 --> 01:11:31,333
Yeah, a little, Boss.

1086
01:11:31,416 --> 01:11:33,208
In fact, it's very droopy.

1087
01:11:33,291 --> 01:11:34,958
Very droopy, Boss.

1088
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:39,125
Hold it a minute, will you? It needs some water.

1089
01:11:40,916 --> 01:11:44,791
Don't let me see you laughing at me again,
else I'll ram that smile down your throat.

1090
01:11:44,875 --> 01:11:46,708
I'm Fat Sam. Don't ever forget that.

1091
01:11:46,791 --> 01:11:48,583
No.1 man. Top dog. Mr. Big.

1092
01:11:48,666 --> 01:11:50,458
Always have been. Always will be.

1093
01:11:50,541 --> 01:11:52,250
Now, get outta here!

1094
01:11:52,333 --> 01:11:53,958
FAT SAM: Oh...

1095
01:11:54,041 --> 01:11:55,583
Numero uno.

1096
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:59,500
Be careful, Boss. The floor is wet.

1097
01:11:59,583 --> 01:12:01,125
Fizzy...

1098
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:04,250
I'm gonna break your neck!

1099
01:12:04,333 --> 01:12:06,125
Fizzy!

1100
01:12:08,125 --> 01:12:09,666
TALLULAH: Hi, honey.

1101
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:11,625
- Here he is.
- Hey! Bugsy.

1102
01:12:11,708 --> 01:12:13,458
How are you doing, Sam?

1103
01:12:13,541 --> 01:12:15,458
Am I glad to see you.

1104
01:12:15,541 --> 01:12:17,583
- How are you?
- Good. You?

1105
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:19,291
Pull up a chair.

1106
01:12:19,375 --> 01:12:22,708
- Fix him a drink, honey.
- Thanks. A special on the rocks.

1107
01:12:24,083 --> 01:12:26,125
So, what can I do for you, Sam?

1108
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:29,416
Bugsy, I'm in a jam.
Dandy Dan's breathing down my neck.

1109
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:32,541
Any minute now,
he'll take over my entire organization.

1110
01:12:32,625 --> 01:12:34,291
You've still got all this.

1111
01:12:34,375 --> 01:12:37,458
Not if Dandy Dan gets his way.
I won't have a dime for a shoeshine.

1112
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:42,625
Tallulah, could you leave us alone a minute?
This is man's talk.

1113
01:12:42,708 --> 01:12:46,041
- Oh, that's all right. I'm unshockable.
- Go fix your make-up.

1114
01:12:46,125 --> 01:12:48,000
I've already fixed it.

1115
01:12:48,083 --> 01:12:50,666
Go make yourself more beautiful
than you already are.

1116
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:53,458
You know that that's impossible.

1117
01:12:53,541 --> 01:12:54,875
Anything's possible.

1118
01:12:55,958 --> 01:12:58,041
All right. I'll go manicure my gloves.

1119
01:13:03,666 --> 01:13:05,916
Bugsy, believe me,

1120
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,750
my gang's all gone, my business is in ruins.

1121
01:13:08,833 --> 01:13:10,875
My friends don't want to know me.

1122
01:13:10,958 --> 01:13:12,583
I'm a wreck.

1123
01:13:12,666 --> 01:13:15,458
In short, Bugsy, I need your help.

1124
01:13:15,541 --> 01:13:16,708
Why me?

1125
01:13:16,791 --> 01:13:20,791
Because you're no mug.
You've got brains up there, not pretzels.

1126
01:13:21,958 --> 01:13:23,833
Nah, it's not my line.

1127
01:13:31,666 --> 01:13:33,916
- $400?
(Phone rings)

1128
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,250
Do we have a deal?

1129
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:37,583
Hello?

1130
01:13:38,625 --> 01:13:40,250
Bugsy, it's for you.

1131
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:42,083
I think it's Blousey.

1132
01:13:42,166 --> 01:13:43,833
You got a deal.

1133
01:13:44,916 --> 01:13:47,333
Hold on a minute. He won't be a second, honey.

1134
01:13:48,375 --> 01:13:49,791
I'll see you, Bugsy.

1135
01:13:51,916 --> 01:13:53,250
Hello. Blousey?

1136
01:13:53,333 --> 01:13:54,958
What are you doing there?

1137
01:13:55,041 --> 01:13:56,750
- Just business.
- With Tallulah?

1138
01:13:56,833 --> 01:14:00,166
- No. With Fat Sam.
- Did you get the tickets?

1139
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:03,041
Er... No. You see, er...

1140
01:14:03,125 --> 01:14:05,000
- You promised me.
- I know,

1141
01:14:05,083 --> 01:14:07,083
but Hollywood could wait a couple of days.

1142
01:14:07,166 --> 01:14:09,375
You had no intention of taking me to Hollywood.

1143
01:14:09,916 --> 01:14:13,250
I do. There's just something else
I gotta do first, that's all.

1144
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:15,083
You promised me!

1145
01:14:15,166 --> 01:14:16,791
Trust me, will you?

1146
01:14:16,875 --> 01:14:19,166
Look, I can't talk now. I'll call you.

1147
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:24,416
# Only a fool

1148
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:27,916
# Like fools before me

1149
01:14:29,333 --> 01:14:34,291
# I always think with my heart

1150
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:41,083
# Only a fool

1151
01:14:41,166 --> 01:14:45,791
# That same old story

1152
01:14:45,875 --> 01:14:52,083
# Seems I was born for the part

1153
01:14:52,166 --> 01:14:57,000
# It's a lesson that I've learned

1154
01:14:57,083 --> 01:15:01,958
# And a page I should have turned

1155
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:09,875
# I shouldn't cry, but I do

1156
01:15:09,958 --> 01:15:14,083
# Like an ordinary fool

1157
01:15:14,166 --> 01:15:20,416
# When her ordinary dreams fall through

1158
01:15:28,916 --> 01:15:32,041
# How many times

1159
01:15:33,125 --> 01:15:37,250
# Have I mistaken...

1160
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:39,666
- What can you see?
- Shh!

1161
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:43,291
# Good looks and laughs for bad news?

1162
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:50,208
# How many times

1163
01:15:50,291 --> 01:15:54,750
# Have I mistaken

1164
01:15:54,833 --> 01:16:01,708
# Love songs and laughs for the blues?

1165
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:06,416
# When a road I've walked before

1166
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:11,166
# Ends alone at my front door

1167
01:16:12,333 --> 01:16:19,041
# I shouldn't cry, but I do

1168
01:16:19,125 --> 01:16:23,250
# Like an ordinary fool

1169
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:28,500
# When her ordinary dreams

1170
01:16:28,583 --> 01:16:32,500
# Fall through...

1171
01:16:32,583 --> 01:16:34,291
- Splurge guns!
- Where?

1172
01:16:34,375 --> 01:16:37,208
In the crates, stupid.
Look what it says on the truck.

1173
01:16:37,291 --> 01:16:39,000
- I can't.
- Can't you read?

1174
01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:41,958
Sure. I'm just a little short-sighted.
What's it say?

1175
01:16:42,041 --> 01:16:45,625
It says: Splurge Imports Incorporated.

1176
01:16:45,708 --> 01:16:48,291
Dock 17. East River.

1177
01:16:48,375 --> 01:16:51,500
- That must be where they keep the guns.
- Right.

1178
01:16:53,458 --> 01:16:55,000
Look out!

1179
01:16:56,208 --> 01:17:02,666
# It's a lesson that I've learned
and a page I should have turned

1180
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:09,625
# I shouldn't cry, but I do

1181
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:14,208
# Like an ordinary fool

1182
01:17:14,291 --> 01:17:18,791
# When her ordinary dreams

1183
01:17:18,875 --> 01:17:23,416
# Fall through

1184
01:17:26,291 --> 01:17:28,333
Oh, hi, Blousey. Miss your train?

1185
01:17:28,416 --> 01:17:31,000
- Blousey, what happened?
- A guy let you down?

1186
01:17:31,083 --> 01:17:33,500
- That broad needs her head fixed.
- Yeah.

1187
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:39,666
- Er, yeah?
- I was wondering if I could have my job back.

1188
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:41,791
Sure, sure. Everybody's welcome.

1189
01:17:41,875 --> 01:17:43,958
The more the merrier. Go right in.

1190
01:17:46,166 --> 01:17:48,041
- Hi, Blousey.
- Hi, Blousey.

1191
01:17:49,083 --> 01:17:51,625
Did you ever see a broad carry a torch so high?

1192
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:52,916
Yeah.

1193
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,791
The Statue of Liberty.

1194
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:08,000
(Ship's hooter)
BUGSY: This must be the place.

1195
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:11,541
BUGSY: Two guards on the door.

1196
01:18:11,625 --> 01:18:12,958
Two on the roof.

1197
01:18:13,041 --> 01:18:14,583
Two on the pier.

1198
01:18:14,666 --> 01:18:16,291
What are we gonna do?

1199
01:18:16,375 --> 01:18:18,125
- Go home?
- There must be a way in.

1200
01:18:18,208 --> 01:18:20,416
We can't slug our way through them.

1201
01:18:21,708 --> 01:18:24,208
I guess you're right. Let's get out of here.

1202
01:18:26,625 --> 01:18:28,875
What are we gonna do, Leroy, huh?

1203
01:18:28,958 --> 01:18:30,541
We need a few more men.

1204
01:18:31,166 --> 01:18:33,125
BUGSY: We need an army.

1205
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:36,541
- There ain't no armies round here, Bugsy.
- Yeah, I know.

1206
01:18:38,625 --> 01:18:40,458
# Down, down, down and out

1207
01:18:40,541 --> 01:18:42,416
# Down, down, down, down...

1208
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:44,666
Hang on a minute, Leroy.

1209
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:47,000
# Down, down, down, down

1210
01:18:47,083 --> 01:18:48,875
# Down, down, down and out

1211
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:52,958
# Down, down, down, down,
down, down, down and out

1212
01:18:53,041 --> 01:18:54,458
# Down, down, down, down

1213
01:18:54,541 --> 01:18:57,125
# Down, down, down and out

1214
01:18:57,208 --> 01:19:00,666
# Down, down, down, down,
down, down, down and out

1215
01:19:01,958 --> 01:19:04,791
# Down, down, down, down,
down, down, down and out

1216
01:19:04,875 --> 01:19:10,500
# You don't have to sit around complaining
'bout the way your life has wound up

1217
01:19:11,541 --> 01:19:13,458
ALL: # Down, down, down, down

1218

What am I saying?
Right. I gotta have courage.

1279
01:22:20,041 --> 01:22:21,833
Give this to Baby Face. Hurry it up.

OK. You know what to do.

1284
01:22:30,916 --> 01:22:33,958

Yeah, right. Get out there. Right.

1286

GUARDS: Come on. Open it up!

Come on, everybody.
Let's open up these boxes.

Come on!

1293
01:24:03,250 --> 01:24:04,916
Give us a sack.

(High-pitched voice) # My name is Tallulah

1295
01:24:14,416 --> 01:24:17,458
- # My first rule of thumb...
- Stop fooling around, Leroy.

1296
01:24:17,541 --> 01:24:18,791
Sorry, Bugsy.

1297
01:24:20,541 --> 01:24:24,791
DANDY DAN: Right, gang. I don't have
to tell you how important this is to me.

1298
01:24:24,875 --> 01:24:28,125
This is the caper
that's gonna take the lid off City Hall.

1299
01:24:28,208 --> 01:24:31,000
- This is the big one.
GANG: The big one.

1300
01:24:31,083 --> 01:24:33,333

GANG: The shakedown.

- The payoff.
GANG: The payoff.

1302
01:24:35,416 --> 01:24:37,458
And, I tell you, it's gotta be good.

1303
01:24:37,541 --> 01:24:39,166
It's gotta be neat.

1304
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:40,875
And it's gotta be quick.

1305
01:24:40,958 --> 01:24:45,375
GANG: It's gotta be good, it's gotta be...
- Quit repeating everything I say!

1306
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:53,791
You shouldn't have any trouble.
Just er...Fat Sam and a few dance-hall girls.

1307
01:24:55,583 --> 01:24:58,500
OK. Good luck and off we go.

1308
01:24:58,583 --> 01:25:01,083
Three cheers for Dandy Dan. Hip, hip...

Too kind, guys. Too kind.

1313
01:25:12,333 --> 01:25:14,416
We've got to plan hard.

1314
01:25:42,708 --> 01:25:44,166
Jelly, Jelly. Open up!

1315
01:25:45,791 --> 01:25:47,666
They're here! They're here!

1316
01:25:51,291 --> 01:25:53,333
Shh! OK, everybody. Just act like normal.

1317
01:25:53,416 --> 01:25:55,166
Come on, you guys. Get to work.

1318
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:57,083
All right, girls. Off you go.

01:25:58,416 --> 01:26:00,708
Razzmatazz, let's hear some music.

1320

RAZAMATAZ: # Anybody who is anybody
will soon walk through that door...

1321
01:26:15,958 --> 01:26:18,291
OK, fellas. This is our moment.

1322
01:26:18,375 --> 01:26:21,583
Keep a cool head
and keep those fingers pumping,

1323
01:26:21,666 --> 01:26:24,791
cos, remember, it's history you'll be writing.

1324
01:26:28,208 --> 01:26:30,166

OK, everybody, freeze!

1329

Let 'em have it!

1330
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:37,333
Amazing scenes have just been reported
on the Lower East Side.

1331
01:27:38,166 --> 01:27:40,041
There's been a frightful bad show...

1332
01:27:40,125 --> 01:27:42,083
(Reporters all talk at once)

1333
01:27:47,791 --> 01:27:49,666
So, this is show business?

1334
01:27:54,208 --> 01:27:56,041
This is getting ridiculous.
