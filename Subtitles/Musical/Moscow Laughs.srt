26
00:02:57,189 --> 00:03:00,984
Re-lieved by joyfull song

27
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:05,239
She never lest sadden

28
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:09,795
Cities and countrysides admire the song

29
00:03:09,936 --> 00:03:13,607
And admire the song bigger towns

30
00:03:14,315 --> 00:03:18,069
Song helps us to live and to love

31
00:03:18,697 --> 00:03:22,785
She like a friend calls and leads

32
00:03:22,838 --> 00:03:26,967

44
00:05:11,814 --> 00:05:15,526
We are able to sing and laugh, like children

45
00:05:15,876 --> 00:05:18,129
Among obdurate fight and work

46
00:05:20,098 --> 00:05:24,165
So we were born like this

47
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,787
That we never give up, nowhere and never

48
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:32,295

68
00:07:39,588 --> 00:07:42,132
Stand at ease!

69
00:08:01,453 --> 00:08:05,124
Oh how you played walking through the countryside

70
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:10,073
For a music like this
they should rip hands off.

71
00:08:10,655 --> 00:08:13,556
You, Germans are
a hot nation.

72
00:08:13,591 --> 00:08:16,265
Can this be called "playing"?

73
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,786
You should play like Sapojnik!

74
00:08:18,821 --> 00:08:22,074
Mister, please don't
compare me to him.

75
00:08:22,404 --> 00:08:24,600
I can't play likeSapojnik.

76
00:08:24,635 --> 00:08:28,056
Sapojnik has been doing it
for seven years,

77
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,528
And I only for two!

78
00:08:29,563 --> 00:08:30,892
Shut up!

79
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,056
Take your violin and play!

80
00:08:34,753 --> 00:08:36,709
What should I play?

81
00:08:36,744 --> 00:08:38,665
Oh... play this!

82
00:09:10,202 --> 00:09:11,958
Well!

83
00:09:11,993 --> 00:09:15,121
The scores came to bits.

84
00:10:14,764 --> 00:10:17,642
Costa Frascini!

85
00:10:23,326 --> 00:10:25,524
Frascini, composer?

86
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:28,729
Conductor. He arrived today.

87
00:10:28,946 --> 00:10:31,616
Mom, mom!

88
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:37,145
I'm coming, I'm coming.

89
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,301
Where he is?

90
00:10:53,336 --> 00:10:55,203
Here!

91
00:10:55,432 --> 00:10:58,811
In foreign bathrobe.

92
00:11:02,044 --> 00:11:05,422
I'm going to meet him.

93
00:11:05,428 --> 00:11:08,473
But it's not quite the thing.

94
00:11:09,332 --> 00:11:13,377
Stay calm.
I'll do it subtly.

95
00:11:34,745 --> 00:11:38,915
...will never and nowhere be lost.

96
00:12:12,424 --> 00:12:14,884
Allright.

97
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:19,972
Enough for today.

98
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:29,208
Auf viedersehen.

99
00:12:29,243 --> 00:12:31,863
Goodbye.

100
00:14:51,344 --> 00:14:55,223
Please tell me,
do we have hot water today?

101
00:14:55,258 --> 00:14:56,804
Yes.

102
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,592
Let's get to know ourselves.

103
00:15:30,536 --> 00:15:33,192
Look. a fish!

104
00:15:33,227 --> 00:15:35,848
Fish, fish, fish.

105
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:40,431
My mum is delighted
with your music.

106
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:45,754
You are such a young man,
and yet a genius.

107
00:15:47,026 --> 00:15:48,987
But... how it is possible?

108
00:15:49,022 --> 00:15:51,212
Habit.

109
00:15:51,247 --> 00:15:55,210
Pplease tell me,
what are you playing now?

110
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:58,266
I'm working on Beethoven.

111
00:15:58,301 --> 00:16:00,475
-Who?
-Beethoven.

112
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:05,255
How I envy you.

113
00:16:05,426 --> 00:16:07,860
And where are you living?

114
00:16:07,895 --> 00:16:10,172
In "Transparent sources".

115
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:13,543
Oh, there!
Nearly on the top.

116
00:16:13,578 --> 00:16:14,314
You made a life, mister.

117
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:17,019
And you're alone there?
Aren't you sad?

118
00:16:17,054 --> 00:16:18,297
Why alone?

119
00:16:18,332 --> 00:16:20,605
There is a lot of us.

120
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,435
He's got a professor here...

121
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,029
...secretaries.

122
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:28,150
And... dutchwomen...

123
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,005
...swisswomen.

124
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,419
Walking by road
we play wonderfull concerts.

125
00:16:33,454 --> 00:16:34,311
Are they pretty?

126
00:16:34,346 --> 00:16:35,464
Who?

127
00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:36,381
Dutchwomen.

128
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:39,252
Oh, dutchwomen are elegant...

129
00:16:39,287 --> 00:16:41,054
Shapes they have...

130
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:42,821
...o, shapes like this.

131
00:16:42,856 --> 00:16:45,143
Eyes...

132
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:48,010
...o, eyes like this.

133
00:16:48,045 --> 00:16:50,360
Are you taking care of them?

134
00:16:50,395 --> 00:16:53,524
How could I not?
From morning 'till evening.

135
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:57,052
I'd like to be on their place.

136
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:00,223
And what are you doing?

137
00:17:00,432 --> 00:17:02,030
Me?

138
00:17:02,065 --> 00:17:03,815
I'm a singer.

139
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,496
A singer!

140
00:17:05,531 --> 00:17:07,074
Sing something, lady.

141
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,620
Now?
Here?

142
00:17:08,655 --> 00:17:10,036
Well... yes.

143
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:13,366
In costume it's not quite a thing.

144
00:17:13,695 --> 00:17:16,072
But if you'd agree...

145
00:17:16,107 --> 00:17:16,808
What?

146
00:17:16,843 --> 00:17:19,197
...to come to us.

147
00:17:19,232 --> 00:17:23,111
I? To you?
And where do you live?

148
00:17:23,146 --> 00:17:25,084
In "Black Swan".

149
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,884
Oh, you made a life.

150
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:30,548
I'll get you to know with my mother.
Please come.

151
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,140
And she won't be angry?

152
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:36,180
What you..?
My mum will die from joy!.

153
00:17:36,996 --> 00:17:40,708
Well.
If she dies, I'll come.

154
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:45,524
So, everything is established,
I'll be waiting for you.

155
00:17:58,264 --> 00:18:01,226
Ay, what a woman?

156
00:18:07,107 --> 00:18:10,026
You could die for her!

157
00:18:12,364 --> 00:18:16,827
In this frock-coat I played
in 1893 in Stuttgart.

158
00:18:23,317 --> 00:18:27,738
Oh God, I was the same
about 40 years ago.

159
00:18:36,503 --> 00:18:40,507
Today you're playing in front of the audience.

160
00:18:42,953 --> 00:18:46,665
Bring dignity out of you.

161
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:53,473
Guest house for
disorganized patients,
earlier "Black Swan"

162
00:18:55,102 --> 00:18:57,021
He's not here yet?

163
00:18:57,056 --> 00:18:58,690
He's not!

164
00:18:58,725 --> 00:19:02,187
Someone should go for him.

165
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:05,849
And whou would do it?

166
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:09,066
I.
And only for you, madam.

167
00:19:18,202 --> 00:19:21,914
We'll start when he arrives.

168
00:19:32,183 --> 00:19:34,268
He'll arrive for me,

169
00:19:35,449 --> 00:19:37,534
I'll wait for him.

170
00:19:38,396 --> 00:19:41,775
No,no,no
no one's better than him

171
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,705
I'll approach and start.

172
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,061
I'm all burning and I don't know why

173
00:19:48,913 --> 00:19:51,332
Dear heart! How should I live now?

174
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:55,211
Ah, why from all the men, the only one

175
00:19:57,755 --> 00:20:01,216
Can we love in our life!

176
00:20:04,565 --> 00:20:07,401
Heart in chest!

177
00:20:10,698 --> 00:20:13,784
Is falpping like a bird

178
00:20:15,838 --> 00:20:19,801
And you want to know,
what's waiting for you

179
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:26,836
And you want to gain happiness.

180
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,639
Joy is singing like
spring skylark

181
00:20:38,897 --> 00:20:41,900
Life if warm and bright

182
00:20:44,475 --> 00:20:48,061
If I had ten hearts

183
00:20:52,957 --> 00:20:56,169
I'd give every single one to him

184
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:03,021
Heart in chest

185
00:21:05,822 --> 00:21:09,493
Is flipping like a bird

186
00:21:12,554 --> 00:21:17,267
And you want to know,
what's waiting for you

187
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,563
And you want to gain happiness.

188
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:40,145
No,no,no
no one's better than him

189
00:21:42,586 --> 00:21:45,547
I'll approach and get to know!

190
00:21:53,581 --> 00:21:57,084
How many times have I told you,
not to make draughts!

191
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:59,383
Don't forget that I have a voice!

192
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:00,569
I also have a voice!

193
00:22:00,604 --> 00:22:02,110
Yes. voice...

194
00:22:02,145 --> 00:22:03,646
..which should be silent...

195
00:22:03,681 --> 00:22:06,786
...when I talk to you!

196
00:22:06,883 --> 00:22:09,719
Why aren't you
dressed up yet?

197
00:22:09,754 --> 00:22:11,987
I didn't made it.

198
00:22:12,022 --> 00:22:14,095
Why I made it?

199
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:17,842
Immediately go and dress up.

200
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:32,656
Maestro!

201
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,488
Why aren't you coming up?

202
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:37,915
Me?

203
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:40,303
I'm not alone...

204
00:22:40,338 --> 00:22:44,092
It's about they're waiting for me.

205
00:22:44,522 --> 00:22:48,067
That's silly,
come together.

206
00:22:48,102 --> 00:22:50,327
Togehter?

207
00:22:53,604 --> 00:22:56,037
No.. maybe next time.

208
00:22:56,072 --> 00:22:59,909
But absolutely, you have to come.
You promised.

209
00:22:59,944 --> 00:23:02,291
One minute.

210
00:23:02,326 --> 00:23:05,871
I'll talk it with
my band.

211
00:23:05,906 --> 00:23:08,672
Then maybe I'll come.

212
00:24:24,454 --> 00:24:26,718
Good morning.

213
00:24:26,753 --> 00:24:28,982
Ach, master came.

214
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,093
Please meet my mother.

215
00:24:45,128 --> 00:24:48,840
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

216
00:24:50,821 --> 00:24:54,116
What's with you?
What could it be?

217
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,038
Nice to meet you.

218
00:25:00,073 --> 00:25:01,966
What's happeinng?

219
00:25:05,561 --> 00:25:07,897
What's up with you?

220
00:25:07,932 --> 00:25:08,749
Nothing.

221
00:25:08,784 --> 00:25:10,663
I'm just thinking...

222
00:25:10,698 --> 00:25:14,494
What will woman like this one do on 8th march?
Simply slaughter.

223
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:16,555
And what?

224
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:19,510
She has no hands,
she has no vote.

225
00:25:23,682 --> 00:25:26,769
We invite to dance

226
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,269
Well, let's dance.

227
00:26:16,025 --> 00:26:19,820
Maestro, so far
you ran from me?

228
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,948
Why are you so
devoted to this place?

229
00:26:26,983 --> 00:26:28,274
- You can see it?
- What?

230
00:26:28,309 --> 00:26:29,531
That I'm devoted.

231
00:26:29,566 --> 00:26:32,819
Of course, on this place
you're visible for everyone.

232
00:26:32,854 --> 00:26:34,771
About what place are you talking?

233
00:26:34,806 --> 00:26:36,688
- About a window.
- Oh, a window.

234
00:26:36,694 --> 00:26:40,198
I thought that about a place
I'm deovted to.

235
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,238
I mean you
haven't noticed nothing?

236
00:26:42,273 --> 00:26:42,995
No.

237
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,907
And that I'm devoted,
haven't you noticed?

238
00:26:44,942 --> 00:26:46,662
It seemed to me...

239
00:26:46,697 --> 00:26:48,950
Oh, it seemed to me.

240
00:26:48,985 --> 00:26:51,079
Please don't scare me.

241
00:26:51,114 --> 00:26:53,742
You're joking and I,
thought you noticed.

242
00:26:53,777 --> 00:26:56,248
How strange you are.

243
00:26:56,969 --> 00:26:59,045
Well. let's dance.

244
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:03,292
All right, go without me
I'll come later.

245
00:27:03,327 --> 00:27:05,563
Good.

246
00:27:06,966 --> 00:27:08,926
We'll drink a cup of kruszon (vodka)

247
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:10,869
What?

248
00:27:10,904 --> 00:27:12,778
Kruszon.

249
00:27:33,214 --> 00:27:35,841
And where are you going?

250
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:45,526
So?

251
00:27:45,561 --> 00:27:46,959
Och, strong!

252
00:27:46,994 --> 00:27:50,289
It can sweep a bull off his feet.

253
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:06,994
When I'll see you again?

254
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:10,908
Tomorrow I can't, I have a hairdresser.

255
00:28:10,943 --> 00:28:14,231
Maybe... tomorrow evening?

256
00:28:14,557 --> 00:28:17,477
You'll come to the oak.

257
00:28:18,302 --> 00:28:21,013
Will you?

258
00:28:22,004 --> 00:28:24,715
Will you?

259
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:27,416
Yes.

260
00:28:35,427 --> 00:28:37,705
I feel...

261
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,661
...that my heart is goning to rip apart!

262
00:28:52,076 --> 00:28:56,581
Maestro, maybe play something for us?

263
00:28:56,616 --> 00:28:58,880
Please.

264
00:29:05,817 --> 00:29:07,941
I don't have my violin...

265
00:29:07,976 --> 00:29:10,065
... I'll play on this.

266
00:33:00,617 --> 00:33:03,287
Out of here!

267
00:33:05,953 --> 00:33:08,372
Bravo.

268
00:33:24,195 --> 00:33:27,698
Without glasses I can't see a thing.

269
00:33:51,398 --> 00:33:54,702
Time to eat something!

270
00:33:54,737 --> 00:33:58,006
Maestro, to the table.

271
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:15,875
Aniuta, Aniuta!

272
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:18,406
Where's Aniuta?

273
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:23,862
In a minute, a minute.

274
00:34:25,851 --> 00:34:28,604
In a minute, a minute.

275
00:34:50,187 --> 00:34:52,064
Please fetch spirit of camphor.

276
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:53,732
Where it is?

277
00:34:53,767 --> 00:34:55,366
In bedroom.

278
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,369
My God, who's this?

279
00:35:51,404 --> 00:35:53,156
First time in my life..!

280
00:35:56,462 --> 00:35:59,047
Good toy, well made.

281
00:35:59,082 --> 00:36:01,740
Looks like it's living.

282
00:36:01,775 --> 00:36:04,236
Better are made abroad.

283
00:36:04,271 --> 00:36:08,483
Please look at the head.
Is this a sheep?

284
00:36:09,129 --> 00:36:12,549
Head indeed... it's not the best part.

285
00:36:12,584 --> 00:36:15,689
But the chopper is very similar.

286
00:36:18,808 --> 00:36:24,022
By the way,
I'd like to keep the memory
about today evening.

287
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,592
Do you have a photograph?

288
00:36:28,646 --> 00:36:31,816
I have, but it's really small.

289
00:36:39,641 --> 00:36:42,143
Here it is.

290
00:36:45,016 --> 00:36:51,606
If you are so kind, please
give it to me with your autograph.

291
00:36:52,822 --> 00:36:53,783
With what?

292
00:36:53,818 --> 00:36:55,775
With autograph.

293
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:59,231
Miss Helena,
I wouldn't scant you anything...

294
00:36:59,266 --> 00:37:02,577
...but I don't have what I don't have.

295
00:37:50,337 --> 00:37:53,841
Where you came, run away.

296
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:11,196
Carefully, hang tough lady.

297
00:38:11,231 --> 00:38:14,689
Carefully, hang tough lady.

298
00:38:16,228 --> 00:38:17,521
Carefully....

299
00:38:23,276 --> 00:38:26,182
Hang tough lady!

300
00:38:26,217 --> 00:38:29,089
Carefully...

301
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:03,558
A tiger!

302
00:39:04,699 --> 00:39:06,367
Tiger.

303
00:39:21,786 --> 00:39:24,538
God... who's this?

304
00:39:25,451 --> 00:39:27,870
It's me.

305
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,036
How you came here?

306
00:39:30,071 --> 00:39:33,616
I went to the composer, Frascini.

307
00:39:34,811 --> 00:39:36,605
But he'a already here.

308
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,400
No, he's there.

309
00:39:38,435 --> 00:39:42,564
How he could be there, if it's him?

310
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,848
No.
It's not him.

311
00:39:50,783 --> 00:39:53,536
Who are you?

312
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:56,362
Me?
Kolka Patiechin.

313
00:39:56,397 --> 00:40:00,151
- What Patiechin?
- Herdsman.

314
00:40:00,501 --> 00:40:01,703
How herdsman?

315
00:40:01,738 --> 00:40:02,989
As per usual, herdsman.

316
00:40:03,024 --> 00:40:04,847
Usual herdsman?

317
00:40:04,882 --> 00:40:08,427
No, not usual, but main!

318
00:40:10,777 --> 00:40:13,689
- Young man...
- Please call Lena...

319
00:40:13,724 --> 00:40:16,519
Herdsman has nothing to talk
to my daughter.

320
00:40:16,554 --> 00:40:22,601
I hope that this misunderstanding
will remain between us.

321
00:40:23,283 --> 00:40:26,745
Please take this and go away.

322
00:40:27,187 --> 00:40:29,820
But you invited
me yourself...

323
00:40:29,855 --> 00:40:33,567
Yes, but the thought that
you are a musician...

324
00:40:33,602 --> 00:40:35,517
... and you are a herdsman.

325
00:40:35,552 --> 00:40:39,639
Today herdsman...
and... and tomorrow musician.

326
00:40:39,972 --> 00:40:43,768
So please come "tomorrow".

327
00:40:44,313 --> 00:40:47,483
Now get along!
Away!

328
00:42:09,948 --> 00:42:13,744
There are lots of pretty girls

329
00:42:14,408 --> 00:42:17,703
There are lots of pretty names

330
00:42:18,711 --> 00:42:21,624
But only one bothers

331
00:42:21,659 --> 00:42:24,828
Taking calm and sleep away

332
00:42:24,863 --> 00:42:27,728
When you are in love.

333
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:31,858
Love will stun you unexpected

334
00:42:32,611 --> 00:42:36,449
When you don't bide it

335
00:42:37,271 --> 00:42:40,274
And suddenly every evening becames

336
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:43,183
Suprisingly beautiful

337
00:42:43,218 --> 00:42:45,882
And you sing

338
00:42:46,074 --> 00:42:50,620
Heart, you don't want to be calm

339
00:42:54,958 --> 00:42:59,045
Heart, how good is to live

340
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:08,135
Heart, how good you are like this

341
00:43:10,928 --> 00:43:15,140
Thank you heart that you can love like this.

342
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:25,666
Heart, you don't want to be calm

343
00:43:31,122 --> 00:43:35,209
Heart, how good is to live

344
00:43:40,123 --> 00:43:44,419
Heart, how good you
are like thid

345
00:43:47,174 --> 00:43:51,136
Thank you heart that you can...

346
00:43:56,095 --> 00:43:58,723
...love like this.

347
00:44:03,065 --> 00:44:05,943
Hours have passed..

348
00:44:19,036 --> 00:44:21,622
Konstant Iwanowicz.

349
00:44:21,657 --> 00:44:24,258
To me?

350
00:44:25,528 --> 00:44:28,239
I'm here for Helena Siergiejewna.

351
00:44:31,662 --> 00:44:34,414
Lena sent you here?

352
00:44:34,449 --> 00:44:39,037
Wait, wait...
I've seen you before.

353
00:44:39,709 --> 00:44:42,920
I've seen you
many times.

354
00:44:42,955 --> 00:44:43,774
By morning.

355
00:44:43,809 --> 00:44:46,323
When I buy milk...

356
00:44:46,358 --> 00:44:50,904
...you always pass by
with your herd.

357
00:44:56,875 --> 00:44:59,545
Is she mad?

358
00:44:59,743 --> 00:45:03,372
A mosquito was sitting on you,
Konstanty Iwanowicz

359
00:45:03,407 --> 00:45:05,203
There are lots of mosquitos.

360
00:45:05,238 --> 00:45:07,991
But why she didn't came
be herself?

361
00:45:08,026 --> 00:45:09,063
Who?

362
00:45:09,098 --> 00:45:09,983
Lena.

363
00:45:10,018 --> 00:45:13,605
You live here permanently?

364
00:45:13,641 --> 00:45:15,082
She's mad at me.

365
00:45:15,117 --> 00:45:18,203
Who taught you to play like this?

366
00:45:18,238 --> 00:45:19,742
Where is Lena?

367
00:45:19,777 --> 00:45:21,361
I'm going away tomorrow.

368
00:45:21,396 --> 00:45:22,701
And Lena?

369
00:45:22,736 --> 00:45:23,925
Today.

370
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,504
Is going away?

371
00:45:26,627 --> 00:45:29,380
Oh, she went away!

372
00:45:31,527 --> 00:45:32,926
She sailed by steamboat.

373
00:45:32,961 --> 00:45:36,506
And I'm going by train, tomorrow.

374
00:45:38,178 --> 00:45:40,805
She went away.

375
00:45:43,316 --> 00:45:46,695
It was a big mosquito,
Konstanty Iwanowicz.

376
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:48,460
Mosquito, mosquito...

377
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:52,040
...and she, unfortunately, went away.

378
00:45:52,075 --> 00:45:53,198
I thought...

379
00:45:53,233 --> 00:45:57,820
... thought, thought.
Too late.

380
00:45:59,409 --> 00:46:01,536
Konstantynie Iwanowiczu.

381
00:46:01,571 --> 00:46:03,554
Kostia!

382
00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:06,300
Kostiaaaaaa!

383
00:46:35,373 --> 00:46:39,085
I'm all burning and I don't know why

384
00:46:40,472 --> 00:46:43,933
Dear heart! How should I live now?

385
00:46:45,967 --> 00:46:49,930
Ah, why from all the men, the only one

386
00:46:53,418 --> 00:46:56,671
Can we love in our life!

387
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:03,904
Heart in chest!

388
00:47:06,521 --> 00:47:09,649
Is flapping like a bird

389
00:47:12,613 --> 00:47:16,617
And you want to know, what's waiting for you

390
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:23,816
And you want to gain happiness.

391
00:47:37,985 --> 00:47:41,947
And you want to know,
what's waiting for you

392
00:47:41,982 --> 00:47:45,482
And you want to gain happiness.

393
00:47:52,206 --> 00:47:55,460
Joy is singing like
spring skylark

394
00:47:55,495 --> 00:47:58,910
Life is warm and bright

395
00:47:58,945 --> 00:48:02,325
If I had ten hearts

396
00:48:06,703 --> 00:48:09,998
I'd give every single one to him.

397
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:17,467
Heart in chest

398
00:48:20,406 --> 00:48:23,909
Is flipping like a bird

399
00:48:26,938 --> 00:48:31,943
And you want to know,
what's waiting for you

400
00:48:39,522 --> 00:48:44,485
And you want to gain happiness.

401
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:09,616
Month's up.

402
00:49:14,253 --> 00:49:19,258
The minute hand
runs throught clock face

403
00:49:19,395 --> 00:49:24,233
Quickly as mad
are running cogwheels.

404
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:28,527
Minutes are jumping
throught troubles and cases

405
00:49:29,511 --> 00:49:32,556
Jumpin, jumping, jumping...

406
00:49:32,591 --> 00:49:35,671
...and so month's up.

407
00:50:23,001 --> 00:50:25,396
Yes.
But the conductor is still not here!

408
00:50:25,431 --> 00:50:28,767
How will he conduct,
if the orchestra had never seen him?

409
00:50:28,802 --> 00:50:29,538
- It a scandal.
- What to do!

410
00:50:29,573 --> 00:50:30,773
- The audience is making you mad?
Yes.

411
00:50:30,808 --> 00:50:33,853
So why are you staying here?
Go and calm them!

412
00:50:38,894 --> 00:50:43,107
You, why are you staying?

413
00:50:43,142 --> 00:50:45,627
Come here!

414
00:50:49,011 --> 00:50:51,513
Hold!

415
00:51:02,832 --> 00:51:07,128
Strange.
We only have 5 minutes
and he's not here!

416
00:51:07,163 --> 00:51:08,770
How will we play?

417
00:51:08,805 --> 00:51:10,892
The worst is that without any rehearsal.

418
00:51:10,927 --> 00:51:12,834
And also they say,
that he's a freak.

419
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:16,748
We need to follow
his every move and gesture.

420
00:51:16,783 --> 00:51:20,493
"Passing on the backstage prohibited"

421
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:21,839
Haven't you seen the one
in jacket...

422
00:52:21,874 --> 00:52:24,308
... and white hat?

423
00:52:24,343 --> 00:52:26,742
To hell with it all!

424
00:52:26,777 --> 00:52:28,959
Could be worse.

425
00:52:28,994 --> 00:52:31,141
We lost him.

426
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:30,207
- Here, please.
- Gracias.

427
00:53:32,989 --> 00:53:36,159
Please don't aggrevate.
Everything will be allright.

428
00:55:17,144 --> 00:55:18,328
Understand me!

429
00:55:18,363 --> 00:55:20,243
Understand me!

430
00:55:20,278 --> 00:55:22,124
Oh, stupid.

431
00:55:30,687 --> 00:55:33,982
Original conduction.

432
00:55:35,267 --> 00:55:36,746
Mom!

433
00:55:36,781 --> 00:55:39,283
We threw away the real one!

434
00:55:39,318 --> 00:55:41,799
Guve me binocular!

435
00:56:04,582 --> 00:56:09,129
Emma, for these tears
I love you even more.

436
00:57:33,404 --> 00:57:37,491
Maestro, you're mad at me.
But it wasn't me.

437
00:57:37,526 --> 00:57:41,476
It was my mum.
I'm so rancorous.

438
00:57:41,728 --> 00:57:44,689
Forgive the elderly lady.

439
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:48,887
Let's bow... bow.

440
00:58:14,149 --> 00:58:18,570
It was nice to meet you.
Let's go for a dinner.

441
00:58:22,552 --> 00:58:26,514
The races begin again.

442
00:59:02,901 --> 00:59:05,820
Now that's a man!

443
00:59:06,365 --> 00:59:09,076
Amazing.

444
00:59:09,313 --> 00:59:13,317
We need one like this
to the orchestra.

445
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,659
Hold him!
Hold!

446
00:59:44,694 --> 00:59:47,238
We do, we do!

447
00:59:50,324 --> 00:59:53,578
Hold him.
Harder.

448
01:00:10,599 --> 01:00:13,477
And so, are you
joining our orchestra?

449
01:00:13,512 --> 01:00:15,229
Orchestra?

450
01:00:15,264 --> 01:00:16,947
Do you agree?

451
01:00:16,982 --> 01:00:19,270
Agree!

452
01:00:20,396 --> 01:00:23,733
Months have passed.

453
01:00:42,183 --> 01:00:45,937
"Friendship"
music band

454
01:01:06,279 --> 01:01:08,465
How you play?

455
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,509
It's not me.

456
01:01:10,544 --> 01:01:14,715
I can't exercise
in those conditions!

457
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:18,560
It unnerves...

458
01:01:19,186 --> 01:01:21,939
Behind a wall.

459
01:01:24,125 --> 01:01:28,296
Hey, you!
Couldn.t you be quiet?

460
01:01:30,936 --> 01:01:33,010
I can't work!

461
01:01:33,045 --> 01:01:36,257
Do your best, I'll go
and make a complaint to commandant.

462
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:39,701
Well, come on, let's try.

463
01:01:57,025 --> 01:01:59,360
This phrase should be played differently!

464
01:02:00,847 --> 01:02:03,391
No, like this!

465
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:05,319
He's right.

466
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:06,248
No, he's not!

467
01:02:06,283 --> 01:02:07,068
No, he is right!

468
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:10,481
This phrase should be played like this!

469
01:02:10,806 --> 01:02:13,350
No, this!

470
01:02:15,467 --> 01:02:17,928
And so?

471
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:25,370
Okay, play,
but hands close to yourself!

472
01:02:31,716 --> 01:02:33,353
Comrade commandant.

473
01:02:33,388 --> 01:02:34,866
We are
artists.

474
01:02:34,901 --> 01:02:37,417
We need
dead silence.

475
01:02:37,452 --> 01:02:40,955
And devil knows,
what's going on from the morning.

476
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:41,878
Szum, tararam.

477
01:02:41,913 --> 01:02:44,516
Please embark
something, comrade commandant.

478
01:02:44,551 --> 01:02:47,119
Please pay attention,
to what's happening there.

479
01:02:47,154 --> 01:02:49,261
Devil knows what
comrade commandant.

480
01:02:49,296 --> 01:02:51,121
Please do your best.

481
01:03:04,098 --> 01:03:07,184
O, that's how it sholud be played!

482
01:04:14,679 --> 01:04:18,558
Please pay attention,
comrade commandant,
it's a mess!

483
01:04:22,283 --> 01:04:25,578
To my mind, it's not there.

484
01:04:26,107 --> 01:04:28,064
To my mind, it's nearby.

485
01:04:28,099 --> 01:04:31,527
It's not you,
comrade Patiechin?

486
01:04:31,562 --> 01:04:35,233
Comrade commandant.
We are artists...

487
01:05:37,124 --> 01:05:38,721
Of course it's you!

488
01:05:38,756 --> 01:05:43,261
But what are you, comrade,
but...

489
01:05:48,755 --> 01:05:51,125
...artists...!

490
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,496
We're in silence!

491
01:05:56,917 --> 01:05:59,670
Dead silence.

492
01:06:02,177 --> 01:06:04,554
What was happening here?

493
01:06:05,801 --> 01:06:09,889
We ha.. had..
ha... had rehearsal!

494
01:06:12,415 --> 01:06:15,334
You had a rehearsaland I'll kick you out!

495
01:06:37,666 --> 01:06:40,181
Everything fizzled out.

496
01:06:40,216 --> 01:06:42,529
First time in our life...

497
01:06:42,564 --> 01:06:45,901
...we go into Great Theather...

498
01:06:45,936 --> 01:06:49,213
...and so... very well.

499
01:06:51,805 --> 01:06:54,266
And where are
we going to do rehearsal now?

500
01:06:54,301 --> 01:06:56,390
Rehearsals?
We have no place for it!

501
01:06:56,425 --> 01:07:00,846
Me must serve notice,
that we won't play.

502
01:07:03,913 --> 01:07:07,083
I know where're going to do rehearsal.

503
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:08,340
Where?

504
01:07:08,375 --> 01:07:11,837
Boys, follow me, we're going.

505
01:07:11,872 --> 01:07:14,804
We're going, boys.

506
01:07:28,927 --> 01:07:31,012
Lena is working.

507
01:10:14,406 --> 01:10:19,160
Lenoczka!
Eggs worked?

508
01:10:21,375 --> 01:10:25,463
Now you'll be accepted for Great Theater!

509
01:10:26,117 --> 01:10:28,744
Lenoczka.

510
01:10:32,410 --> 01:10:35,037
What's up with you?

511
01:10:36,672 --> 01:10:40,425
Comrades.
Concert in fifteen minutes.

512
01:10:42,526 --> 01:10:44,787
Twenty roubles
to the Great Theater.

513
01:10:44,822 --> 01:10:47,552
What's with you
are you joking?.

514
01:10:47,587 --> 01:10:49,987
I'm going to the garage.
Alone.

515
01:10:50,022 --> 01:10:52,387
Go, I wont't do you any harm.

516
01:10:52,422 --> 01:10:55,455
Boys, get in.

517
01:11:03,955 --> 01:11:07,027
Citizens, beware.

518
01:11:07,062 --> 01:11:09,252
The hearse is not made of rubber.

519
01:11:09,287 --> 01:11:11,443
No more will fit in.
Whereinto?

520
01:11:16,342 --> 01:11:18,594
We're off.

521
01:12:22,857 --> 01:12:25,318
Did anything happen to you?

522
01:12:25,353 --> 01:12:27,669
Aniuta!

523
01:12:29,311 --> 01:12:31,480
Where are you going?

524
01:12:31,515 --> 01:12:33,614
I don't know.

525
01:12:33,649 --> 01:12:35,106
Going with us?

526
01:12:35,141 --> 01:12:36,352
I don't know.

527
01:12:36,387 --> 01:12:38,578
So, we're off.

528
01:12:38,613 --> 01:12:40,769
Boys, take her.

529
01:12:59,904 --> 01:13:03,407
Hey, and who will pay?
Puszkin?

530
01:13:04,248 --> 01:13:07,001
Pay for what?

531
01:13:07,074 --> 01:13:09,947
We rode?
We rode!

532
01:13:09,982 --> 01:13:14,278
You decided 30 roubles extra?
Decided!

533
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:17,201
No doubt!

534
01:13:18,187 --> 01:13:20,819
You'll sit here, lady.

535
01:13:20,854 --> 01:13:25,400
Unless they pay,
I won't let you.

536
01:13:38,619 --> 01:13:43,124
Let's continue our concert.

537
01:13:44,354 --> 01:13:48,837
And now...
Liszt's music band

538
01:13:48,872 --> 01:13:53,320
from mill operators' guild

539
01:14:33,505 --> 01:14:34,923
Whereinto?

540
01:14:34,958 --> 01:14:37,321
Sit!

541
01:14:37,766 --> 01:14:38,684
What. isn't it working?

542
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,363
No.

543
01:14:39,398 --> 01:14:42,651
Give it to me, I'll try.

544
01:14:55,051 --> 01:14:55,973
Play!

545
01:14:56,008 --> 01:14:58,052
- On what?
- With your lips.

546
01:14:58,087 --> 01:14:59,958
But how?

547
01:15:03,137 --> 01:15:06,129
She's shaking.

548
01:15:06,164 --> 01:15:09,501
She will catch cold.

549
01:15:09,991 --> 01:15:13,370
Shroud yourself.

550
01:15:15,487 --> 01:15:18,949
Filemon, Filemon, wake up!

551
01:15:20,583 --> 01:15:22,835
Take out half a liter.

552
01:15:27,315 --> 01:15:29,109
Stay, stay...!

553
01:15:30,023 --> 01:15:32,151
Leave something for the lady.

554
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:36,721
Drink.

555
01:15:36,756 --> 01:15:39,884
What you.. I don't drink.

556
01:15:40,499 --> 01:15:43,961
Please drink,
or you'll catch a cold.

557
01:15:44,681 --> 01:15:46,358
I don't want.

558
01:15:46,393 --> 01:15:49,270
Don't talk, drink!

559
01:16:40,242 --> 01:16:44,663
Go on, squarely,
to be happy!

560
01:17:08,602 --> 01:17:11,271
Pot...

561
01:17:13,341 --> 01:17:16,594
Get together, lady.

562
01:17:16,687 --> 01:17:18,325
Whereto?

563
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:20,388
You'll go with me.

564
01:17:20,423 --> 01:17:22,416
We're going to them.

565
01:17:22,451 --> 01:17:24,498
I'll wait here.

566
01:17:24,533 --> 01:17:27,411
We're going, as I say!

567
01:17:57,751 --> 01:18:00,545
Where are ours?

568
01:18:11,453 --> 01:18:14,331
Wait here.

569
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:57,053
Don take offences, comrades,
but I have a witness..

570
01:18:58,531 --> 01:19:02,034
Forgive me comrades,
the ride is made?

571
01:19:02,069 --> 01:19:03,158
Made!

572
01:19:03,193 --> 01:19:05,828
We decided 30 roubles?

573
01:19:05,863 --> 01:19:08,294
Decided.
And no talking!

574
01:19:08,329 --> 01:19:10,844
I need to drive
the deceased back.

575
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:13,549
Wait, we'll finish our work
and go back.

576
01:19:13,584 --> 01:19:14,828
Deceased, comrade.

577
01:19:14,863 --> 01:19:18,325
Deceased will wait,
he's got no hurry.

578
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:19,669
Give me the money!

579
01:19:42,743 --> 01:19:46,330
Aniuta, Aniuta, Aniuta, Aniuta,
what you... what you?

580
01:19:59,155 --> 01:20:02,700
Sing!
Sing!

581
01:20:11,023 --> 01:20:15,110
Aniuta, sing!
sing, Aniuta.

582
01:20:32,769 --> 01:20:36,022
Sing as they please you.

583
01:20:51,371 --> 01:20:54,832
Heart in chest

584
01:20:57,983 --> 01:21:01,987
Is flipping like a bird

585
01:21:04,832 --> 01:21:08,836
And you want to know,
what's waiting for you

586
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:16,732
And you want to gain happiness.

587
01:21:23,832 --> 01:21:27,502
Love will stun you unexpected

588
01:21:28,849 --> 01:21:32,728
When you don't bide it

589
01:21:34,666 --> 01:21:38,586
And suddenly every evening becomes

590
01:21:38,621 --> 01:21:41,656
Suprisingly beautiful

591
01:21:44,384 --> 01:21:47,179
And you sing

592
01:21:52,867 --> 01:21:56,454
Heart, you don't want calm

593
01:22:03,104 --> 01:22:07,150
Heart, how good is
to live

594
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:16,957
Heart, how good you
are just like this

595
01:22:20,786 --> 01:22:24,998
Thank you heart,
that you can love like this.

596
01:22:29,990 --> 01:22:33,535
...thant you can love like this.

597
01:23:33,844 --> 01:23:37,155
Ciuch, ciuch, ciuch, ciuch,

598
01:23:37,190 --> 01:23:40,467
Our iron has already warmed up.

599
01:23:40,502 --> 01:23:42,039
You fell in love, realized

600
01:23:42,074 --> 01:23:43,612
You met a wrong womam.

601
01:23:43,647 --> 01:23:45,150
You got mad, looked behind

602
01:23:45,185 --> 01:23:46,514
And saw a beauty one.

603
01:23:46,549 --> 01:23:49,008
Tiuch, tiuch, tiuch, tiuch,

604
01:23:49,043 --> 01:23:51,468
Our iron has already warmed up.

605
01:23:52,562 --> 01:23:54,272
Everyone can make a mistake,

606
01:23:54,307 --> 01:23:55,595
Love is really tiring,

607
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:57,215
Cause not in vain they say:

608
01:23:57,250 --> 01:23:58,741
We learn the hard way.

609
01:23:58,776 --> 01:24:02,038
Tiuch, tiuch, tiuch, tiuch,

610
01:24:02,073 --> 01:24:04,424
Our iron has already warmed up.

611
01:24:04,459 --> 01:24:06,776
I'm nothing in comparision to her,

612
01:24:06,811 --> 01:24:08,387
But it'll change.

613
01:24:08,422 --> 01:24:09,926
He'll be mine -

614
01:24:09,961 --> 01:24:11,431
And never go away.

615
01:24:48,165 --> 01:24:50,876
Aniuta, I always wanted
to say to you...

616
01:24:53,502 --> 01:24:54,712
Leave her!

617
01:24:54,858 --> 01:24:57,077
Aniuta, I always

618
01:24:57,112 --> 01:24:59,165
Let me speak!

619
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:03,537
Aniuta, I always wanted
to say to you...

620
01:25:30,684 --> 01:25:34,458
Song helps us
to live and to love

621
01:25:34,493 --> 01:25:38,198
Like a friend
calls and leads

622
01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:42,237
And who with song
strides through life

623
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:46,158
Will never and nowhere
be lost

624
01:26:09,765 --> 01:26:13,518
Song helps us
to live and to love

625
01:26:13,810 --> 01:26:17,863
Like a friend
calls and leads

626
01:26:17,898 --> 01:26:21,777
And who with song
strides through life

627
01:26:21,812 --> 01:26:25,697
Will never and nowhere be lost

628
01:26:49,763 --> 01:26:53,517
Song helps us
to live and to love

629
01:26:53,767 --> 01:26:57,694
Like a friend
calls and leads

630
01:26:57,729 --> 01:27:01,566
And who with song
strides through life

631
01:27:01,601 --> 01:27:05,410
Will never and nowhere be lost

632
01:27:05,445 --> 01:27:09,533
And who with song
strides through life

633
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:13,453
Will never and nowhere be lost

634
01:27:14,121 --> 01:27:17,707
We are able to sing and laugh,
like children

635
01:27:17,742 --> 01:27:21,253
Among obdurate fight and work

636
01:27:21,795 --> 01:27:25,472
So we were
born like this

637
01:27:25,507 --> 01:27:29,511
That we never give up
nowhere and never

638
01:27:37,644 --> 01:27:41,481
And who with song
strides through life

639
01:27:41,516 --> 01:27:45,318
And who with song
strides through life

640
01:27:45,353 --> 01:27:48,797
Will never and nowhere
be lost

641
01:27:48,832 --> 01:27:52,242
Never and nowhere
be lost!

642
01:28:58,350 --> 01:29:02,062
THE END
