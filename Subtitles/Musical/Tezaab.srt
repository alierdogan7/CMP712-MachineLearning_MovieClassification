1
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,024
who are you? what are you
doing at this hour at my house?

2
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,368
Lotia Pathan sent us.

3
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,407
Today is the last day to pay
the dues. You didn't pay.

4
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,032
we came to remind you.

5
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:53,077
No need to remind me.
I'll pay when I've money.

6
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:55,409
You said, when your daughter
will dance on the stage...

7
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,915
... then you will earn
lots of money.

8
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:04,354
she gave 25 performances but
not one drop of water rained.

9
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,358
Don't talk much. Get lost
else I'll call police.

10
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:15,367
Listen, shyamlal, if money
doesn't reach by 12 tomorrow,...

11
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:20,030
... we will ruin your life.

12
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:21,367
You threaten me,
you rogues....

13
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:28,209
It's not threatening but
taking your signature.

14
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:33,418
Complete document will be
written tomorrow, until...

15
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,753
... the blood lasts in your body
and our pen can write.

16
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:07,420
what are you saying! we have given
both white and black money already.

17
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,751
You want 50,000 more?

18
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:19,432
I'm sure Mohini won't come for
rehearsal if 50000 isn't received.

19
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,092
- what are you saying! - what's
the matter, Krishnamurthy?

20
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:26,097
You seem to be worried?
Is everything fine?

21
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:31,473
He demands 50000 more.- what!
Threatening to cancel the show.

22
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,478
Really!

23
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:39,484
Rs.50,000 is nothing for an
artist like your daughter.

24
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,817
- You can take it any time.
- This is blackmail!

25
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:45,823
shut up. This is not the way
to talk to a man like shyamlal.

26
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,825
Go, bring 50000.

27
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:52,156
You come to my house with Mohini.
I'll give you the money there.

28
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,501
Here is your 50,000.
Count it

29
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,504
I won't do such a thing.

30
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:05,100
You will repent if the
money is found short.

31
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:09,447
How can you leave without
a drink?

32
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,483
Let Mohini go for rehearsal.
You join us for a drink.

33
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:30,498
Mohini, you go for rehearsal.
I'll join you later.

34
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:35,541
You sit here and drink liquor
while I dance there?

35
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:44,345
If someone else had said this
I would have killed them.

36
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:49,554
You won't kill me because your
drinks, gambling are paid by me.

37
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:55,561
I'm the source of your income.
You have no guts to stop it.

38
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,502
Give me the drink.

39
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:15,206
You rogue, you said Rohini won't
come for rehearsal unless we pay?

40
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:17,548
50000?

41
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:25,553
Lock up the old man. Throw him on
the backstage when the show beings.

42
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,558
...to hear his daughter sing.

43
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,622
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

44
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,557
Tell me what song do you want?

45
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,562
Tell us where were you?

46
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:08,566
I was waiting for someone.

47
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,568
who was that?

48
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,606
whom I love.

49
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:22,581
- whom I plead again and again.
- How? - Like this.

50
00:06:55,748 --> 00:07:02,620
" 1, 2, 3, 4. 5, 6,
7, 8, 9,10, 1 1, 12, 13...."

51
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,297
" count up to 13..."

52
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:18,394
" counting numbers here
I'm waiting for you"

53
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:19,630
" come O my lover
the spring is here as well."

54
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:10,221
" Got your message on
the 14th day"

55
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:16,694
"... saying you will
come on 1 5th "

56
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:19,697
" not come on 14th
nor on 15th"

57
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:23,701
" what have you gained by
leaving me longing for you?"

58
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:28,740
" I waited on 16th too
all dressed up for you"

59
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,742
" Come, O my lover.

60
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:28,766
" By 17th, I thought
I gave up hopes"

61
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:32,770
" By 18th, my heart was broken"

62
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:36,808
" I spent the whole
of 19th crying"

63
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,810
" By 20th, my heart
was broken'

64
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:44,815
" even then I couldn't
stop loving you "

65
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,819
" come to me O my lover"

66
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:52,941
" 21, 22, 23 and 24th
have gone by too. "

67
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:59,958
" 25th and 26th made me
long for you all the more"

68
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:05,895
" only 4 days are left
to make it a month"

69
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:29,944
" days turned to weeks, weeks
into months, months into an year"

70
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:35,961
" come and see the
condition I'm in"

71
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:39,964
" I wander aimlessly
like a mad person"

72
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:43,627
" hanging between
life and death"

73
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:46,967
" feel lonely at nights "

74
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:53,978
" please come, I'm counting
days for you to come "

75
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:11,022
- Let go off me. - where
have the goons come from?

76
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:25,035
Let go off me.

77
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:38,169
- Greetings, brother.
- Greetings Munnabhai.

78
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,208
sit here Munnabhai.

79
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:52,213
I saved the money from police raid.
Here is today's protection money.

80
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:57,221
I sold only 150 bottles today.
so,....

81
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:05,822
This is the month end. so
no one comes to gamble.

82
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:24,739
Distance between your life & death
is as thin as sharpness this knife.

83
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:30,221
Next time you lie, you wont
have hands to be bandaged.

84
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:36,750
stand straight. Munna takes money
but saves us from troubles too.

85
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:39,226
Come on quick. Don't waste time.

86
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:49,274
Pakia, you are still here!

87
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:54,278
You are on strike or the
railways?....come here.

88
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,282
You are hurt? Had a fight?

89
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:01,217
I'll tell you.
There is a new gang.

90
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,222
It hangs around Hanuman lane near
station and loots Andheri area.

91
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:08,987
It bashed him up and
took away his money.

92
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:11,995
- whose gang?
- His name is Mukut Bihari.

93
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:14,224
He committed murder in some other
state. He is their gang leader.

94
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,235
- Know his whereabouts? - No.
Couldn't see anything in darkness.

95
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,567
Difficult to recognise in the
crowd dancing in Dandiya...

96
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,606
... in Hanuman Lane.

97
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:00,007
- Hey, you, come here. - Yes.
- Give me icecream.

98
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,292
- Papa, my earing! - My daughter's
earing is stolen.

99
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:19,296
Catch him...

100
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:23,960
My daughter's earing
is stolen.

101
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,970
My bag contained my salary.

102
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:08,345
He looks rich.

103
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:01,432
we will be the losers if
he gives away money like that.

104
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:44,508
Are you tired? Exhausted?

105
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:49,546
Go to some other venue
or go home.

106
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,873
which one of you
is Mukut Bihari?

107
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,553
He is not drunk!

108
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:36,561
I've many more tricks to bring out
the rat. who is Mukut Bihari?

109
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:39,563
You want Mukut Bihari?

110
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:45,228
Rashid, tell him the address
of Mukut Bihari.

111
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,556
Try again.

112
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,627
I'll make dance now.

113
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:06,278
Tell us the reason now
for searching for me.

114
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:12,620
You better get out of this area
and not be seen here again.

115
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:19,289
I've committed 12 murders.

116
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:25,303
13th will be yours.

117
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:31,301
Munna, you should have
brought a bigger weapon.

118
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,345
Now listen to me carefully.

119
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:44,688
Else you won't be in a position
to listen to anything for life.

120
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,690
Tell them to drop the weapons.

121
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,696
whatever you have looted
in my area of control...

122
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,638
- Here it is.
- Drop it here.

123
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:08,303
Move it without much
drama.

124
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,350
There is Munnabhai,

125
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:20,357
stop there.

126
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,690
Looks like their train has come.
Pakia, get them in. - I'll.

127
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:34,705
Get in.

128
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,367
Now, put him in the
cattle carriage.

129
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:42,742
- send him to his native place.
- By train.

130
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,756
Be careful.

131
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:58,762
They are our guests.

132
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:20,751
Return all the purses
in the bag.

133
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,753
- Munnabhai... - what's it?
- Telegram.

134
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:31,421
Munna, come home soon.
Trouble at home.

135
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:19,806
7 men, 16 women and
40 children are injured.

136
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,811
3 are dead and 42 shops
are looted.

137
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,813
No one knows who did it?

138
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:27,817
we only know that the gang
belongs to Lotia, a criminal.

139
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,481
Police were after him already.
Don't know where he took Mohini.

140
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:35,826
Any news about the owners of
the motorcyles found there?

141
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,827
They were all stolen ones.

142
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:41,831
Message on wireless says an ousted
criminal has entered our area.

143
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,833
- who is he?
- Munnabhai

144
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:47,837
He was ousted from this area
8 years ago. Here is his file.

145
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,876
This is Mahesh Deshmukh!
How did he become Munna?

146
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:59,883
He is known as Munna in this area.

147
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:03,819
He had undergone one year
imprisonment for murder.

148
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,825
File describes him as a
dangerous criminal.

149
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:14,832
My memory says he was a sentimental
but an youth, full of life.

150
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:17,834
who was ready to die
for his country,

151
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:23,875
- Do you know him, sir?
-2 years ago....

152
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:27,206
There was a bank in a quite lane
in front of my police station.

153
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,837
Both his parents worked there.

154
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:35,544
I still remember the day
I met him for the first time.

155
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,555
Father.... father....

156
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:44,656
Didn't I tell you that I'll
win the best navy cadet cup?

157
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:48,563
Yes, mother. The best
Navy Cadet Cup.

158
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,234
- Bless you my son
- lnspector, this my son Mahesh.

159
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:03,344
Mr.Deshmukh, you have to
distribute sweets now.

160
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:05,278
- Your son has fulfilled your
ambition. - True.

161
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,874
Let Mahesh fulfil his dream.

162
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:11,888
- what do you want to become? -Join
the navy and become Admiral, sir.

163
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:18,895
He always talks of dying
for the country.

164
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:21,898
He must be a patriot in his
last birth who died in...

165
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,900
... freedom struggle.

166
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:27,563
Happy to meet you.

167
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,944
I promised to buy you a
cycle. Here it is.

168
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:37,948
Bye, mother.
we will meet at dinner.

169
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:57,968
Don't move else I'll shoot.

170
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:06,499
Hand over the safe keys, oldman.

171
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:08,945
I won't give the keys.

172
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,607
why do you invite your death?
Take out the keys.

173
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:18,285
I served this bank for 20 years.
It's my duty to protect it.

174
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:22,291
I don't care if I have to
give up my life for it.

175
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:56,026
she's going to bank. she has a
baby! Her life is in danger.

176
00:29:57,095 --> 00:30:01,031
You go and inform the
police on the way.

177
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:05,694
My parents are trapped inside!
You tell me to go away?

178
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:10,036
They have guns which can go off
anytime. You risk your life.

179
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:16,045
The right to fight against crimes
lies with uniformed men alone?

180
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:21,084
Not us? I've dedicated my
life to the country the day...

181
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,746
... I wore this uniform.

182
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,091
we have to stop the woman and
the baby from entering the bank.

183
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:31,094
Decoits might shoot you
because of your uniform.

184
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:34,097
I'll bring her back.
Give me orders.

185
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:56,153
- Let me carry him.
- May god bless you.

186
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:59,815
- These days children don't
care even for parents.- Listen...

187
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:03,087
I've to do all the work alone.

188
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:31,154
someone save my child.

189
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,154
Take this, sir.

190
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,273
sir, see what they have
done to my mother.

191
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:03,178
- Mahesh....
- Father....

192
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,214
Let us take him to hospital.

193
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:11,881
son, I've not got much time.

194
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:19,219
If you want to do something
for me, fulfil my dream.

195
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,891
Your dream is my dream now.

196
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:26,232
Don't say so, father.

197
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:32,242
Entire country is on your side.

198
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:35,608
Take care of Jyothi.

199
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:49,292
Father....

200
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:49,353
The most joyous moments of his
life turned saddest moments.

201
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:54,687
I've not witnessed such a cruel
joke of fate happen to anyone.

202
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,362
Mahesh left for Bombay
with his sister.

203
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:05,096
since that day I felt my power
of endurance of pain has grown.

204
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,969
search every nook and
corner of the town.

205
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:17,013
seal all the exits from the city.

206
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:20,016
It is essential for me
that this man is caught.

207
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:23,046
I want to know how he turned
from Mahesh to Munna.

208
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:02,357
Brother.....

209
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:07,363
- Jyothi...
- Brother...

210
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:16,405
what happened?

211
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:25,381
what's the matter?
Did Lotia trouble you?

212
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:31,079
No. I cried because I saw
you after an year.

213
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:39,088
There are 4 more days
left for one year.

214
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:44,764
I'm still branded as
an ousted criminal.

215
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,429
Police is chasing me
like mad dogs.

216
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,101
You know that I cannot come
back to Bombay till...

217
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,144
... I finished my punishment.

218
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,482
Tell me why did you
call for me?

219
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:00,414
For Mohini' sake.

220
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:13,429
- what happened to her?
- Lotia Pathan's men abducted her.

221
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:15,430
what do I do!

222
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:19,435
whom do I tell other than
you to rescue Mohini?

223
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:23,473
There're lakhs of girls in town.
I'm not responsible for them.

224
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:28,477
Mohini is one in a lakh. she
helped you in saving my honour.

225
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:33,482
I'm already an ousted criminal.
Don't want more problems.

226
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,485
It is the job of police or
her father. Not mine.

227
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:41,149
Being her father he can
get her married to saxena.

228
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:45,286
- Theater owner?
- Yes. He wants to marry Mohini.

229
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:49,158
so be it. she isn't related
to either of us.

230
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:52,502
I always considered he
my sister-in-law.

231
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,503
she can never become your
sister-in-law.

232
00:37:54,605 --> 00:38:00,475
I gave her that right until
one of you get married.

233
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:06,278
Look into my eyes and say that
she doesn't mean anything to you.

234
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,484
You cannot do that.

235
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:19,495
- You, crazy! Go, get a cup
of tea for me.- I'll.

236
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:23,499
Don't irritate me more, saxena.
It's all because of you.

237
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:27,833
Blaming each other isn't going
bring Mohini back.

238
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:31,499
so, forget your anger and
think how to rescue her.

239
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:35,874
Help is at your door step.

240
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:41,347
The dark room where your daughter
is hidden by Lotia Pathan...

241
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:44,554
... is unapproachable for police.

242
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,555
But my hands can reach.

243
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,558
You, a fresher in crimes
mess with Lotia Pathan!

244
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,560
He will hack you and
throw you in the gutter.

245
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:57,567
You have gone blind out of greed.
Cannot see the opportunity.

246
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:01,160
He is talking of my gain!

247
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:07,511
If I fail to bring her back, one
of your enemy gets out of your way.

248
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:12,548
Because you think Lotia and his
men won't let me get out alive.

249
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,550
I know that.

250
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:17,553
I'll bring back Mohini.

251
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:19,555
You will get back your daughter.

252
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:24,219
It is to my advantage either way.

253
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:29,561
If he comes back I get my daughter.
If not, I'll be rid of one enemy.

254
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:32,363
what do you gain by
risking your life?

255
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:33,568
Rs.50,000.

256
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:38,233
A deal to save my daughter!
Get lost from here.

257
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:40,610
- Think again.
- wait.

258
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:49,285
I'll pay 50000. Once Mohini
returns we get back everything.

259
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:53,623
- what if she refuses to dance?
- I take responsibility for that.

260
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:59,424
I'll clear your debts and arrange
livelihood for you for life.

261
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:06,302
I don't understand one thing.

262
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:10,636
He wants money in return for
his favour. what do you want?

263
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,679
with your blessings.

264
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:19,682
why not, saxena?

265
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:23,686
I can sell even my blessings
if I get good price for it.

266
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:26,689
Okay, Munna. It's a deal.

267
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,694
what all you want?

268
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:38,360
One Hundi Biryani, Kabab,
one Kaleji,...

269
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:41,700
... one fried fish with
all the accompaniments.

270
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,740
- Understand? - I did.
what will you have?

271
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:46,742
One Pulao and one icecream.

272
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:50,747
Brother, you?

273
00:40:55,820 --> 00:41:01,349
It means we need Rs.720 to
celebrate Chandini' birthday.

274
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:05,691
Do something. My hair is turning
silver(grey) because of starvation.

275
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:08,697
why not use it to buy food.

276
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:14,704
I've heard of finding hair in food.
1st time to hear food from hair!

277
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,739
Do something, fast.

278
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:32,755
It looks as if you are destined to
have a feast today! Let's go.

279
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:38,420
- Clean up the table. where are
you going? - To wash my hands.

280
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:42,090
sit down. Pick the
pocket of that man.

281
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:45,760
- He will come to know.
- Did you come to know?

282
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,771
I'll hit you.

283
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:54,777
They are my boys. Let them eat
what they want. I'll pay the bill.

284
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,755
waiter, bring tea with
less of water.

285
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,828
- I found it first.
- I found it.

286
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:51,835
This is Bombay. Money belongs
to whoever holds it.

287
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:57,840
Then it should go to
hotel's kitty.

288
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:02,777
Cannot we settle it?

289
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:08,476
we can. You pay my bill.

290
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,816
I'll pay.

291
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,821
Fine.

292
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:21,831
Get out fast else you have to
scrub and shine the dishes.

293
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,875
My uncle will pay the bill.
Isn't it, uncle?

294
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:38,882
- I'll pay. Let him go. - Take it
from him. He loves me a lot.-Fine.

295
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,887
Chicken was delicious!
How much is the bill?

296
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:48,891
waiter, what's the total amount?
Rs.48 for 6 plates chicken.

297
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:53,896
6 veg.pulao, 6 chicken chilly,
6 Boti Masala,

298
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:57,900
6, chicken special,
12 custard,....

299
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:01,996
... and a fainted Marwadi.

300
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:07,877
we managed for today.
what about tomorrow?

301
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:14,884
There is no dearth of idiots.
Not difficult to find one.

302
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:19,888
People better watch their money.

303
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,891
This is Munna's motorcycle!
Munna....

304
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:26,895
Here is advance. I'll return
the car in 2 days. - Nevermind.

305
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:34,904
we are glad to see you.

306
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:41,911
How did you come unexpectedly?
you still have 4 days to go for....

307
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,947
- I had to come.
- For Mohini?

308
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:46,949
- Yes.
- Lotia's address?

309
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:50,953
His den is in shaitantekhdi
near Kasarghat.

310
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:52,955
How did you find out?

311
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:58,962
All drug addicts know addresses
of all goons in the town.

312
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:01,896
Buy them drugs they
will tell you.

313
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:08,563
we have to go well prepared.

314
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:12,908
- Just tell us when to leave.
- Now, immediately.

315
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:21,951
- How're you managing? - O rich,
you better guard your money.

316
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,021
sir! Here!

317
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:04,619
You might have changed
your ways.

318
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:06,958
I've not.

319
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:19,008
- what is my crime? - You are
banished means...

320
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:22,010
... you must have
committed some crime.

321
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:27,015
That's why society thought you
deserve to be kept away from them.

322
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:33,022
This same society had once exiled
Lord Rama for 14 years.

323
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,023
what was his crime?

324
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,025
You are a criminal for the law.

325
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:49,038
Didn't you know the result of
threatening a police with a knife?

326
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:54,042
I'm ready for more punishment.

327
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:59,081
But I've to go now, sir.
Let's go, Baban.

328
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:05,019
Mahesh, stop. My duty tells
me to arrest you.

329
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:08,023
And shoot if necessary.

330
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:13,028
- shoot.
- I won't do it. Because,...

331
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:20,036
I want to know how a patriot
became an enemy of the country?

332
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:22,037
I forgot my past life.

333
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:27,075
You've to remember because my duty
isn't just arrest criminals,...

334
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:34,083
... but to know how youth of the
nation turn criminals, then...

335
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:39,884
... perhaps, I can save few of
youth turning to crimes in future.

336
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:45,094
You talk of preventing crimes?
Your police turned me criminal.

337
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:49,097
- How? - I've no time to
explain it now.

338
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:55,104
Give me 24 hours time. I'll
surrender myself by that time.

339
00:47:55,205 --> 00:48:00,700
Tell you what you want to know.
Then you can punish me as you want.

340
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:07,049
I cannot give you time
but can go with you.

341
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:09,084
Okay.

342
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:19,094
Now tell me how you happened
to be exiled by law?

343
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:23,098
I joined college here after
returning from Nasik.

344
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:27,102
Began working in swimming pool
at Boats Club.

345
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:33,837
One day I met a girl there.
Her name is Mohini.

346
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:50,159
Madam, it's time to close.
You haven't got into water yet.

347
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,161
Is there no lady teacher
to teach?

348
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,163
what is wrong with me?

349
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:58,167
I want to learn only
from a lady teacher.

350
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:03,103
why do you kick my livelihood?
Kick the water, you can swim.

351
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,767
I would rather drown than
let a man touch me.

352
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:11,806
As you wish. But I've no
qualms about touching a girl.

353
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:19,822
Look at her pose!

354
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:25,160
she prefers drowning than
a man touch her!

355
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:28,163
Drowning in the pool of
his heart!

356
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:32,160
You fatso, I'll teach
you swimming. wait....

357
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:44,213
Help... help her.

358
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:57,225
Help....

359
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:21,283
Let us see her condition.

360
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:48,344
For a learner it is okay.
But a...

361
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:52,347
...sinking person shouldn't bother
who the rescuer is,a man or woman.

362
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:54,349
Congratulations for surviving.

363
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:22,310
- lsn't it time for college?
- There is still time.

364
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:25,006
- Take us for tea. - sure.
- what happened?

365
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:28,350
- someone picked mu pocket.
- You have one!

366
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:31,353
I picked someone's in the
morning.

367
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:40,363
Let us butter up Guldasta. That
will provide us breakfast & tea.

368
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:03,351
Beautiful singing!

369
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:10,018
- we want tea.
- what will you have?

370
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:15,364
- Your song is satisfying enough.
- You must have something.

371
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:19,367
- Atleast tea?- Tea is okay.
- what about eating something?

372
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:22,370
Nothing doing.

373
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:29,377
sometimes we wonder if your voice
is more sweeter or your tea?

374
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:31,413
Do you gargle with tea?

375
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:45,427
someday, some music director will
happen to listen your songs.

376
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:48,430
You will be lead to HMv studio.

377
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:54,095
we will sit and listen to
his songs on radio.

378
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:57,098
- You have a music director
friend. - who?

379
00:52:57,541 --> 00:53:00,408
- O yes. - He arranges
programmes on Tv.

380
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:06,073
- Gives chance to new comers.
- lntroduce him to him.

381
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:10,419
- How much is the bill?
- Don't embarrass me.

382
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,420
- I cannot take money from you!
- Then what do you take?

383
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:15,423
You introduce me to the
music director once.

384
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:18,426
Old man!

385
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:22,430
Keep sugar and tea leaves inside.
Remember their dues.

386
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,432
You are forgetful.

387
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:29,771
There are very few people
who love pure music.

388
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:31,806
shut up and collect
money from them.

389
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:38,446
- You may cut it from my salary.
- what did you say?

390
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:46,488
- Girl in yellow is mine.
- Girl in red dress is mine.

391
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:50,492
Last year she was yours.
Mine, this year.

392
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:58,501
- Mine is with blue veil.
- she is sister-in-law to you.

393
00:53:58,602 --> 00:54:01,435
You can only look at
her slippers.

394
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:04,473
sure. But he has the right
to get beaten up with them.

395
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:19,386
- welcome.
- what are you doing?

396
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,490
Trying to woo the girls.

397
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:29,499
That's not your cup of tea.
You can only boast.

398
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,501
- Do it and show me.
- why not you woo a girl.

399
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:36,504
Bombay girls are
difficult to woo.

400
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,167
Be it any place, girls
are after all girls.

401
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:43,541
One has to have brains to
woo them.

402
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:49,347
Munnabhai, in love, one needs
heart not brain.

403
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,553
Do you remember
Anand Bakshi's song?

404
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:56,558
- Love isn't deliberate
- It just happens.

405
00:54:56,660 --> 00:55:00,255
- Love isn't....
- what is love for....

406
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:06,495
....you may take my life.

407
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:12,507
Enough. You watch so many movies
but don't understand that...

408
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:17,170
... the way situation is created
to make people laugh or cry...

409
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:20,875
... one can make people
fall in love too.

410
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:26,547
- You mean any girl can be
made to fall in love?- sure.

411
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:32,561
This isn't Nasik. Here, you
will be hit with sandals.

412
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:39,568
It is just psychology.
science of wooing girls.

413
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:45,608
Be it college or a stage,
method to woo is the same.

414
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:47,609
Only formulas change.

415
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:52,273
One has to use a different
formula for each girl.

416
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:54,612
Explain us about formula.

417
00:55:55,685 --> 00:56:01,555
Different medicine for different
illness but the rest is the same.

418
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:06,891
It takes long time to woo some
girls, and short time for some.

419
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:09,556
But she falls for you in the end.

420
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:18,233
-This isn't enough.- You have to
show us how the formula works.

421
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:27,606
- I'll, if you bet.-Bet of Rs.100.
- Bet of 100. - Bet.

422
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:32,621
You know what she said?
she said......

423
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:38,423
what is the name of the
last year's college queen?

424
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:42,631
- which class is she in?
- My class.

425
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,632
- And you?
- In Nikita's class.

426
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:50,298
I mean your sister Jyothi's
class.

427
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,675
so, I've to butter up
Jyothi first.

428
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:56,678
Tell her to meet me in the
canteen for lunch if you see her.

429
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,680
It's urgent. Bye.

430
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:05,278
I'm going.

431
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:08,957
- You took long time. - You
wanted money isn't it? Take.

432
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:14,629
- Money! when did I ask for it?
- You didn't!

433
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,635
Must be about movie!
Let's go.

434
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:24,969
You are extra sweet!
what's the reason?

435
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:31,646
It's your classmate, with
blue eyes, black hair...

436
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:35,683
... Iast year's College
queen, Nilita...

437
00:57:36,753 --> 00:57:38,687
... introduce me to her,
please.

438
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:43,692
I'll introduce you to her
but...

439
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:47,354
- You have to do me a favour.
- Ofcourse.

440
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:50,695
Brothers and sisters should
help each other.

441
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:54,702
- Tell me. - she is my friend.
she has some work with you.

442
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:01,641
- Yes. - I want your notes
on psychology.

443
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:05,680
If you can teach me personally..

444
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:14,690
Teaching isn't a problem
but time is.

445
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:19,694
He is refusing. Boring.
There is Nlkita!

446
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:41,750
why say sorry?
I really enjoyed it.

447
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:46,755
Hope you aren't hurt.

448
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:51,756
- will you please sit there?
- what!

449
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:56,765
Be seated.

450
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:03,705
Nikita, this is my brother, Mahesh.

451
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:10,370
Aren't you the one who got
distinction in psychology?

452
00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:13,748
- I was wondering if you can
teach me. - why not?

453
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:17,752
- You made my life!
- I don't understand.

454
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:22,420
I love teaching psychology...

455
00:59:22,525 --> 00:59:26,757
... when the student is like you.

456
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:31,766
Do you have time?

457
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:36,771
we have to take out time.

458
00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:44,779
Mohini, it's all over.
Go to Badrinath to pray.

459
00:59:46,883 --> 00:59:50,819
- shall we go? Here is your book.
- what about us?

460
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:58,486
Here he goes!
Let's go.

461
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:14,136
Looks like she's waiting for Munna

462
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:16,177
They're probably going out.

463
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:17,969
Let's have some fun.

464
01:00:40,503 --> 01:00:42,437
- shall we?
- Yes.

465
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:45,973
You have a flat.

466
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:53,976
- Now what do we do?
- No problem. My lndian lmpala.

467
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:57,144
- we'll go in this.
- sure? - Yes, hop on.

468
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:02,924
- Ready?
- Yes.

469
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:29,984
The guy won't look this way.

470
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:32,487
Must be thinking about Nikita.

471
01:01:33,556 --> 01:01:34,955
Now what do I do?

472
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,493
what are you thinking?
If he doesn't come to save me?

473
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:47,832
so what? People who die
for love change history.

474
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:50,505
Jump right in!

475
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:52,941
Jump, Mohini!

476
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,486
Help!!

477
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,890
Do you come here to practice
swimming or drowning?

478
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,996
One more time and you'll
be an expert at drowning.

479
01:02:24,607 --> 01:02:25,835
Help!

480
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:28,872
Help!!

481
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:32,547
stand straight! stand up!

482
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:35,875
You're in 2 feet of water

483
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:40,555
- when did you come?
- Just now.

484
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:46,893
- I teach swimming.
- How many have you drowned?

485
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:48,561
About 30 or 40..

486
01:02:50,633 --> 01:02:53,568
- How did you come here?
- I haven't swum for ages.

487
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:55,970
Heard you teach swimming
so I came here.

488
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:58,607
- sure.
- Can you teach me diving?

489
01:02:59,675 --> 01:03:01,540
I've won 30 odd medals for diving

490
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:09,551
Raise your arms and dive.

491
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:44,611
Here comes the pest.

492
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:49,624
- Finished lunch?
- Yes, waiting for brother.

493
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:51,620
- May I join you?
- sure. sit down.

494
01:03:52,461 --> 01:03:54,395
we can't enjoy the
food unless you join us.

495
01:03:54,697 --> 01:03:56,631
That is true. we
all have our effect.

496
01:03:57,033 --> 01:04:00,560
Hey, effective monster!
Couldn't you find another table?

497
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:03,571
Give everybody a chance

498
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:07,609
If you object...
I thought Munna...

499
01:04:09,078 --> 01:04:10,568
see how she hurts for Munna.

500
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:14,611
Feed him when he returns
all hungry and thirsty.

501
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:17,948
- lt'll satisfy both.
- You're exceeding limits!

502
01:04:19,088 --> 01:04:21,955
You're talking of limits!
You're supposed to be my pal.

503
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:26,628
You talk sweetly to me.

504
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:31,633
And stick to him like gum!

505
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:35,231
My cultured background doesn't
permit me to answer this filth

506
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:39,038
who's asking for an answer?
Not been swimming for long...

507
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:43,073
Thought I'd start. Can't figure
psychology. Please teach me.

508
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:48,683
Learn all the psychology you want
for all your seven lives!

509
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:50,347
And be assured..

510
01:04:50,753 --> 01:04:52,687
If I knew mad girls like you
study in this college..

511
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:54,382
I'd never come here!

512
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,031
- I'm going.
- where?

513
01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:08,636
I'm leaving the city.

514
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:13,371
what? You'll leave
because of one mad girl?

515
01:05:15,511 --> 01:05:19,447
I can't face anyone
after being humiliated..

516
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:22,684
How do I convince you...?

517
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:25,353
Don't take it seriously.

518
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:28,690
It's more serious than you think

519
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,090
see you.

520
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:37,494
- when will we meet?
- Never.

521
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:41,703
- Not even accidentally?
- No.

522
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:46,503
Mohini aroused feelings
of love for you in my heart

523
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,738
I controlled it this time
but I might not the next..!

524
01:05:58,154 --> 01:05:59,746
what? Nikita left?

525
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:03,082
I..I wanted to apologise to her

526
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,694
I said a lot of things
to her yesterday.

527
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:08,687
what have I done?

528
01:06:10,766 --> 01:06:12,358
I didn't know what I was doing.

529
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:17,697
I only knew that I love you.

530
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:19,435
Me...?

531
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:24,211
Yes. I love you.

532
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:27,745
And I can do anything for you.

533
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:33,213
I can't believe that
a girl could love me.

534
01:06:33,556 --> 01:06:35,148
And a girl like you!

535
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:38,760
Any boy from the college
would willingly kill for you.

536
01:06:39,228 --> 01:06:42,026
Just give me a smile
That's enough for me.

537
01:06:46,102 --> 01:06:51,233
I can't believe the obscure
fragrance of love I sought..

538
01:06:53,876 --> 01:06:55,366
It would be so close to me.

539
01:06:56,879 --> 01:06:59,473
- will you accept me?
- Yes

540
01:07:12,828 --> 01:07:16,764
"Heer grew crazy singing
out Ranjha's name with love"

541
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:21,769
" Lost in your love, she
neither slept nor stayed awake"

542
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:25,807
" Recall nothing but your name"

543
01:07:26,342 --> 01:07:27,775
so Babban, got her!

544
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:29,767
How did you do it?

545
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,814
Not like this.
First hold your ears...

546
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:36,476
Repeat after me.

547
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:40,549
- whether Nasik or Bombay..
- whether Nasik or Bombay..

548
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:43,817
Girls are girls. One must
know how to swindle them.

549
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:46,818
Girls are girls. One must
know how to swindle them.

550
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,831
One doesn't fall in love
One makes them fall.

551
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,832
One doesn't fall in love
One makes them fall.

552
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:54,830
Praise to Mother Psychology!

553
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,874
where are you going?
Pay me the 100 bucks!

554
01:07:59,675 --> 01:08:01,472
Pay the money you bet.

555
01:08:01,877 --> 01:08:04,141
- Give it.
- Take it.

556
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,474
- Now tell us the formula.
- Throwing a party at Golden Gate?

557
01:08:07,883 --> 01:08:10,818
- He will..
- Accepted?

558
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:17,318
Miss Mohini, I wanted to tell
you that Munna is fooling you.

559
01:08:18,894 --> 01:08:20,225
what?

560
01:08:20,896 --> 01:08:23,626
You are being used for
merely winning 100 bucks.

561
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:26,629
- Toying with your feelings.
- Is this a joke?

562
01:08:27,169 --> 01:08:30,832
If you don't believe me, go
to Golden Gate in the evening.

563
01:08:31,674 --> 01:08:33,835
- see for yourself.
- But you..?

564
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,884
This is formula number 420.

565
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:44,877
And how it works..

566
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:48,219
"Aim at one, hit the other"

567
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,896
If you want to flirt with
a girl using this formula..

568
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,900
woo one of her friends..

569
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:01,834
so she gets envious.

570
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:05,874
when the iron of envy is hot..

571
01:09:11,947 --> 01:09:14,882
Forget this and tell us
what happened at the pool.

572
01:09:17,686 --> 01:09:19,881
she openly told me..

573
01:09:20,289 --> 01:09:21,620
what?

574
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:24,892
I really love you.

575
01:09:28,964 --> 01:09:32,297
Then I also responded

576
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:41,541
- I don't believe it...
- He's crazy

577
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:48,950
- Then..?
- I flattered her.

578
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:55,958
I said, I can't imagine
any girl loving me.

579
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:57,954
specially a girl like you!

580
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:01,291
Any boy from the college
would willingly kill for you!

581
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:03,965
- That broad...
- shut up!

582
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:09,368
she said, just give me
a smile. That's enough.

583
01:10:10,306 --> 01:10:13,742
Then I thought I might
as well do the final act.

584
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:16,742
Finito?

585
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:21,481
I held her and said
I was blind so far!

586
01:10:22,084 --> 01:10:26,020
I had no idea the obscure
fragrance of love I sought..

587
01:10:27,356 --> 01:10:28,789
It would be so close to me.

588
01:10:29,091 --> 01:10:31,355
- It's Babban not Mohini.
- so close...

589
01:10:32,094 --> 01:10:34,028
Not in the quest for love.

590
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,034
The girl who stands before you..

591
01:10:41,103 --> 01:10:42,798
This girl who loves you..

592
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:46,698
You used her like an animal!

593
01:10:48,143 --> 01:10:52,045
You crushed her feelings..

594
01:10:53,148 --> 01:10:54,410
You proved your formula!

595
01:10:58,153 --> 01:11:00,087
You turned my love
into a cheap drama!

596
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:04,821
You turned out to be one
of those men that I hate!

597
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:16,531
But the day you learn the
difference between man and beast..

598
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:21,031
That day you'll hate
yourself the most!

599
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:15,494
Listen to me..

600
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,099
I've been longing to meet you

601
01:12:18,567 --> 01:12:19,829
To talk to you.

602
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:26,101
since the Golden Gate fiasco,
I wait for you outside college.

603
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:30,144
Then I wait outside your
house for you all night.

604
01:12:31,213 --> 01:12:32,703
But you probably never
came out of your room.

605
01:12:35,217 --> 01:12:39,153
Jyoti won't talk to me
and all my pals have vanished.

606
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:44,920
How and through whom do
I tell you what I'm feeling?

607
01:12:45,227 --> 01:12:47,957
Move aside! since
that day I hate myself!

608
01:12:48,997 --> 01:12:51,158
But I really love you.

609
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:55,163
I know you are hurt. Badly..

610
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:57,171
Forgive me!

611
01:12:57,773 --> 01:12:59,206
Let me go!

612
01:13:00,642 --> 01:13:03,110
How do I convince you of my love?

613
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:09,548
Give up my life? I can
really jump off this building!

614
01:13:09,818 --> 01:13:11,149
Just tell me!

615
01:13:11,487 --> 01:13:13,751
Even if you won't say it,
I'll still plunge to death!

616
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:16,157
see how risky it is!

617
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:18,551
If I die, there'll be a problem!

618
01:13:18,827 --> 01:13:21,159
You won't be able to apologise
and will never forgive yourself!

619
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:23,758
Jump from anywhere
if you want to die.

620
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:25,558
From a 7 storey building
or the Qutub Minar!

621
01:13:25,968 --> 01:13:27,162
I don't give a damn!

622
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:31,172
This is love!

623
01:13:34,276 --> 01:13:37,006
This is no joke.
How do I convince you?

624
01:13:37,546 --> 01:13:38,979
I don't want to be convinced!

625
01:13:39,281 --> 01:13:40,942
Don't try to convince me!

626
01:13:41,683 --> 01:13:42,945
Fine.

627
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:49,621
Move back.

628
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:54,218
Do you still love me
as much as you did earlier?

629
01:13:56,298 --> 01:13:58,232
Else I'll jump down!

630
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:00,565
You're wasting your time and mine

631
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:08,540
I'll count to 3. If you don't
answer, I'll jump to my death!

632
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:12,213
You may stand there
and count to a 100!

633
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:13,979
I don't care!

634
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:16,882
One! Two!

635
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:22,621
Three!!!

636
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:36,292
"say that you are mine or else.."

637
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:43,704
"l want to die not live"

638
01:15:45,908 --> 01:15:49,309
"say that you are mine or else.."

639
01:15:50,812 --> 01:15:54,714
" I want to die not live"

640
01:15:55,417 --> 01:15:58,352
" Don't ever say that"

641
01:15:59,922 --> 01:16:03,289
" Don't ever do that"

642
01:16:03,825 --> 01:16:07,283
"This coquetry kills me"

643
01:16:08,764 --> 01:16:12,291
" I bind you by a promise"

644
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:16,303
"say that you are mine or else.."

645
01:16:17,773 --> 01:16:21,300
" I want to die not live"

646
01:17:07,756 --> 01:17:11,351
"Yesterday I hurt you"

647
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:16,360
" I am sorry to do that"

648
01:17:18,834 --> 01:17:22,361
" Forgive me for it"

649
01:17:23,438 --> 01:17:27,374
"This is my first love"

650
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:30,411
"You are my love"

651
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:34,813
"This is what attracts me"

652
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:39,215
" I bind you by a promise"

653
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:25,833
" Make me one promise today"

654
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:30,437
" Never again will you be naughty"

655
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:41,449
"You'll love me
as much as I love you"

656
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:45,486
" Love me as much"

657
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:49,490
"The blush spreading on the cheek"

658
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:54,495
"You are bound by a promise"

659
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:47,514
"Complaints and protests"

660
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:52,314
"That's an old story"

661
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:56,319
" Never shall we be annoyed"

662
01:19:57,392 --> 01:20:00,555
" Now I belong to you alone"

663
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:04,963
"we'll be together
even if I die"

664
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:08,959
" Never will we be
annoyed with each other"

665
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:12,903
"we'll be faithful"

666
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:15,431
Now we must stop meeting everyday

667
01:21:15,971 --> 01:21:20,340
why? I've heard the wife gets
boring 7 years after marriage.

668
01:21:20,742 --> 01:21:22,141
- You're already fed up?
- Hush.

669
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:26,646
The exams are drawing close
If I get a first class..

670
01:21:27,148 --> 01:21:29,343
I'll easily get a
commission in the navy.

671
01:21:30,418 --> 01:21:31,680
YOU want to be an
officer in the navy?

672
01:21:32,754 --> 01:21:34,688
Yes. It was Dad's dream.

673
01:21:36,157 --> 01:21:38,091
This job won't just
earn me a livelihood

674
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:43,092
It's a pretext to be a part
of my country, it's struggle.

675
01:21:43,765 --> 01:21:46,495
And if you become
a traffic constable..?

676
01:21:46,768 --> 01:21:48,702
I'll stop the speed of time!

677
01:21:49,771 --> 01:21:52,171
stop. Miss Mohini is passing!

678
01:21:53,808 --> 01:21:55,298
- shall we?
- Yes.

679
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:11,021
Have you no shame gallivanting
with street dogs at night?

680
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,489
Abuse me if you must.

681
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:17,698
Gentlemen don't abuse strangers.

682
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:20,693
Do gentlemen mislead
innocent girls like you?

683
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:24,034
Or do you need men now?

684
01:22:25,473 --> 01:22:28,340
You should be ashamed to talk
to your daughter like this!

685
01:22:29,311 --> 01:22:31,745
Despite having a father
I felt like an orphan.

686
01:22:33,815 --> 01:22:36,010
But Munna's touch
gave me solace.

687
01:22:36,818 --> 01:22:38,752
I feel safe with him.

688
01:22:40,322 --> 01:22:44,759
Do you know the position of the
one you want to be safe with?

689
01:22:45,827 --> 01:22:48,762
His father was an ordinary clerk.

690
01:22:50,098 --> 01:22:52,760
He lives in a rented
ramshackle house.

691
01:22:53,835 --> 01:22:57,271
He works at the swimming pool
for Rs. 500 to survive!

692
01:22:57,572 --> 01:22:58,766
Merely Rs. 500!

693
01:22:59,874 --> 01:23:03,708
His friends are all
unemployed vagabonds!

694
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,141
His father was an ordinary clerk.

695
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:10,478
But he supported his wife
and kids with his earning!

696
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:12,514
He didn't live off
his wife and children!

697
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:15,756
He lives in a rented
ramshackle house.

698
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:19,255
But it's better than this
palace which is mortgaged!

699
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:22,529
He works for a mere 500
to run his house.

700
01:23:23,231 --> 01:23:26,029
But he's better than those
who are drowning in debt!

701
01:23:27,569 --> 01:23:29,764
His friends are
unemployed vagabonds.

702
01:23:30,105 --> 01:23:31,367
But not alcoholics or gamblers!

703
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:38,209
Taunting me? If l
drink or gamble...

704
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,472
Does your Pop pay for it?

705
01:23:40,882 --> 01:23:44,579
No, not my Pop.
My mother pays for it!

706
01:23:44,886 --> 01:23:46,148
shut up!

707
01:23:46,888 --> 01:23:48,583
why didn't you go
to the dance class?

708
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:50,414
- I won't go.
- why not?

709
01:23:50,658 --> 01:23:52,558
I don't want to
because I have to study.

710
01:23:52,894 --> 01:23:56,091
To hell with studies! You
have a stage show in 6 months!

711
01:23:57,899 --> 01:23:59,332
I don't want to do it!

712
01:24:00,835 --> 01:24:02,234
You won't obey me!

713
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:20,821
Next time you see the boy,
you'll suffer your mother's fate!

714
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:25,826
This is the collection from
Bhavani Nagar gambling dens

715
01:24:26,161 --> 01:24:28,823
- How much is it?
- Rs. 17582.25

716
01:24:29,564 --> 01:24:32,089
This is from the
MG Road bar, Rs. 35800

717
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:36,431
And this is from the
police line gambling 17222

718
01:24:36,905 --> 01:24:40,238
- Good. - and this is the
interest from the workers.

719
01:24:40,942 --> 01:24:42,170
Rs. 18000.50

720
01:24:42,444 --> 01:24:43,877
shyamlal, welcome..

721
01:24:51,953 --> 01:24:53,887
sit in the office.
I'll join you soon.

722
01:24:56,958 --> 01:24:59,392
I don't follow...

723
01:25:00,628 --> 01:25:01,822
You neither smoke nor drink.

724
01:25:02,897 --> 01:25:08,802
do you womanise or have cars, homes or any
luxuries.

725
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:12,568
why do you need money?

726
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:16,342
Money is my weapon not need.

727
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:18,378
what is your need?

728
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:22,377
- I need some money.
- Repay the earlier loan first.

729
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:27,285
I'll repay it. Just let my
daughter dance on stage...

730
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:29,617
I'll pay back every penny

731
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:34,224
Lotiya doesn't depend
merely on his debtor's words.

732
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:37,664
Lotiya does no favour by giving

733
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:40,230
And doesn't respect
anything at payback time.

734
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:42,402
when is your daughter performing?

735
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:46,634
If it were in my hands,
I'd start right now.

736
01:25:48,009 --> 01:25:50,944
But she has changed since
that boy got after her.

737
01:25:52,013 --> 01:25:55,744
I don't want trouble.
Just live off my daughter

738
01:25:56,017 --> 01:25:59,214
Is that wrong? I can't
help it if I have a daughter

739
01:25:59,754 --> 01:26:01,278
- Tell me.
- You are right.

740
01:26:01,623 --> 01:26:03,318
Go and take the money.

741
01:26:03,958 --> 01:26:05,391
Little Khan!

742
01:26:07,962 --> 01:26:09,361
Give him Rs. 20000

743
01:26:09,631 --> 01:26:11,292
Note it in his account.

744
01:26:11,966 --> 01:26:14,298
who is this guy?
Never seen him before.

745
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:17,162
- He's my brother.
- I see.

746
01:26:17,405 --> 01:26:19,896
- Great to meet you.
- Just got out of jail.

747
01:26:20,408 --> 01:26:22,433
- Got caught in the Nasik
Robbery Case. - Really?

748
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:24,945
No justice in today's world.

749
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:27,714
Getting caught and
released is fine.

750
01:26:28,416 --> 01:26:29,747
I'm not sorry about it.

751
01:26:30,518 --> 01:26:36,423
But sad that he's the first
Khan to become a drug addict.

752
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:38,617
He contracted this
filthy habit in jail.

753
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:43,725
I swear I'll wreck vengeance
on the man who sent him to jail!

754
01:26:44,365 --> 01:26:46,458
- who is the wretch?
- His name is Munna.

755
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:50,971
Mahesh alias Munna whose parents..

756
01:26:52,073 --> 01:26:53,506
..got killed in the
Nasik bank robbery case?

757
01:26:55,076 --> 01:26:56,771
- Yes. - Your enemy and
mine is the same person.

758
01:26:57,478 --> 01:27:00,413
He's the one after my babe
who has made my life miserable!

759
01:27:00,748 --> 01:27:02,409
- You know his whereabouts?
- Absolutely.

760
01:27:27,475 --> 01:27:29,568
welcome. I'm grateful
you could make it.

761
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:33,411
I've been waiting for 3 days
Never waited for anyone!

762
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:36,016
Like a fool I stand
here for 4 hours!

763
01:27:36,484 --> 01:27:39,009
You could have called up
or told Jyoti..

764
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:47,289
This is our last meeting.
I can no longer see you.

765
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:51,025
- what did you say?
- I can't marry you!

766
01:27:51,833 --> 01:27:55,030
- so I've decided..
- It concerns our lives.

767
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:56,632
How did you decide all alone?

768
01:27:56,838 --> 01:28:00,968
It also concerns my life
I have the right to decide.

769
01:28:02,410 --> 01:28:03,809
what do you think of yourself?

770
01:28:04,078 --> 01:28:07,809
One slap and you'll forget
all about rights!

771
01:28:09,083 --> 01:28:11,677
Now all this has no meaning.
I am leaving!

772
01:28:12,754 --> 01:28:14,517
I'll rip you to pieces!

773
01:28:15,089 --> 01:28:17,523
And myself too!
what do you think I am?

774
01:28:18,092 --> 01:28:20,526
You walk out of my life
and I stand by and watch!

775
01:28:21,095 --> 01:28:24,826
You rich girl! If I can
die for you, I can also kill!

776
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:28,495
But no way will I let
you stay away from me!

777
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:54,560
what is it?

778
01:29:03,104 --> 01:29:04,503
I wanted to see this

779
01:29:08,943 --> 01:29:12,674
I wanted to ensure that
the fear I have of losing you..

780
01:29:13,147 --> 01:29:14,637
Do you also fear losing me?

781
01:29:17,151 --> 01:29:19,847
I wanted to see that
the fire that engulfs me..

782
01:29:20,888 --> 01:29:22,082
whether you too feel it?

783
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:28,861
I wanted to check if meeting
daily had lessened the fire.

784
01:29:45,947 --> 01:29:47,141
what happened?

785
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:49,547
Nothing.

786
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:06,757
who hit you?

787
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:10,761
Father.

788
01:30:11,639 --> 01:30:13,163
He punished me for meeting you.

789
01:30:15,276 --> 01:30:16,834
That is why I was testing you.

790
01:30:18,279 --> 01:30:19,871
I've left everything
and come to you!

791
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:25,211
The Hell that I used
to consider my home

792
01:30:26,888 --> 01:30:28,617
Everything I thought was mine..

793
01:30:29,056 --> 01:30:30,614
I've left everything
and come to you.

794
01:30:31,292 --> 01:30:33,021
I have nothing but
the clothes I wear.

795
01:30:34,295 --> 01:30:36,889
I can't give you
a luxurious life.

796
01:30:38,299 --> 01:30:40,563
But I earn enough to
feed the three of us.

797
01:30:42,303 --> 01:30:46,239
And so life will go on.

798
01:30:51,345 --> 01:30:54,075
There must be some reason
for you to take this step.

799
01:30:55,349 --> 01:30:58,284
Does your father want you
to marry another man?

800
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:03,985
As if he'd do that.
He'll never marry me off.

801
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:07,719
- why?
- He wants me to be a singer.

802
01:31:08,963 --> 01:31:11,488
He wants to make me dance
on stage and live luxuriously

803
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:14,564
That's what he did
with my mother too.

804
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:17,897
she used to sing and dance
on stage. He played the drums.

805
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:22,242
Then they got married
and he stopped playing.

806
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:25,772
And got entangled with
liquor and gambling.

807
01:31:26,347 --> 01:31:29,544
Father blew all mother
earned by dancing on drink.

808
01:31:30,351 --> 01:31:34,082
Every time mother cribbed about
it, father shut her with slaps.

809
01:31:34,755 --> 01:31:38,088
Applause on stage
and slaps at home..

810
01:31:38,793 --> 01:31:42,559
..one day gave mother the
strength to leave home.

811
01:31:43,364 --> 01:31:45,298
I won't stay here one minute!

812
01:31:46,367 --> 01:31:50,098
sure, go ahead. An army of
wolves is waiting out for you!

813
01:31:50,371 --> 01:31:52,305
women who have no men. Go!

814
01:31:53,407 --> 01:31:54,806
Only wolves can be found
in a world created by men!

815
01:31:55,409 --> 01:31:58,810
- lnside the house or out.
- But we protect you.

816
01:31:59,146 --> 01:32:02,775
Can't trust him. someday
the wolf at home may sell me...

817
01:32:03,084 --> 01:32:04,779
I'm not so depraved.

818
01:32:05,686 --> 01:32:09,019
As long as your art sells,
I won't have to sell your body.

819
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:11,681
what about the day
my art doesn't sell..?

820
01:32:11,959 --> 01:32:15,292
Then..my talented daughter
Mohini will come to my rescue

821
01:32:16,364 --> 01:32:19,060
How can my daughter
bear me to be struggling?

822
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:21,301
My child, don't leave me!

823
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:24,304
Don't you dare even
look at my child!

824
01:32:26,407 --> 01:32:27,840
Don't you dare step forward!

825
01:32:30,411 --> 01:32:31,776
Do you know what this is?

826
01:32:42,423 --> 01:32:44,687
This is acid.

827
01:32:47,428 --> 01:32:53,367
If you step forward, you'll
have neither art nor body to sell.

828
01:32:53,768 --> 01:32:55,133
You can't do this.

829
01:32:55,436 --> 01:32:57,370
Because I am your shop.

830
01:32:58,105 --> 01:33:02,303
which supports your
drink and other vice

831
01:33:03,144 --> 01:33:05,339
You don't have the guts
to shut down this shop.

832
01:33:07,415 --> 01:33:09,349
I'll show you my guts!!

833
01:33:28,836 --> 01:33:30,098
Mother!

834
01:33:33,474 --> 01:33:35,408
No!!!

835
01:33:45,219 --> 01:33:47,414
when the door to mother's
room was broken in the morning..

836
01:33:48,489 --> 01:33:52,425
she had ended her journey
from applause to slaps.

837
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:56,422
But her suicide had no
effect on my father.

838
01:33:58,265 --> 01:34:02,759
Mother's journey ended
but...mine begun.

839
01:34:05,873 --> 01:34:12,369
Today, right now I end your
journey from applause to slaps.

840
01:34:14,482 --> 01:34:17,212
Go home and get
Jyoti to the temple.

841
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:22,081
I'll get Babban and the gang
and make other arrangements.

842
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:25,084
- But why...?
- why?

843
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:28,189
silly girl! we're
getting married today.

844
01:34:28,496 --> 01:34:29,588
Today. Now.

845
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:32,864
shall we leave?

846
01:34:49,950 --> 01:34:51,474
where's Munna?

847
01:34:54,288 --> 01:34:57,280
If brother were home
you'd be in hospital.

848
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:01,152
Take her to the dock

849
01:35:02,496 --> 01:35:03,895
Come on!

850
01:35:10,504 --> 01:35:12,438
Kidnapped Jyoti?
who were they?

851
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:15,236
I don't know. My
father must be behind it.

852
01:35:15,543 --> 01:35:17,738
- But where did they take her?
- where??

853
01:35:17,945 --> 01:35:19,207
They mentioned some dock.

854
01:35:21,549 --> 01:35:23,244
You take her to the police
station. I'll go after them!

855
01:35:36,931 --> 01:35:38,193
Help!!

856
01:35:55,649 --> 01:35:57,583
Let go! No!!

857
01:37:13,661 --> 01:37:15,094
But this is not murder.

858
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:19,394
It's an accident that occurred
while I was saving my sister.

859
01:37:20,067 --> 01:37:24,003
Accused Mahesh Deshmukh
alias Munna...

860
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:27,607
You'll be glad to know that
according to the medical report..

861
01:37:28,075 --> 01:37:30,009
Your sister was not raped.

862
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:35,945
Do you mean that when a
bastard is raping your sister..

863
01:37:37,051 --> 01:37:40,953
should you wait till
your sister is raped?

864
01:37:42,223 --> 01:37:46,159
so you can present her
ravaged honour to the court?

865
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:52,460
The court demands
evidence not arguments!

866
01:37:53,734 --> 01:37:57,431
where were you when your
innocent sister was kidnapped?

867
01:37:58,072 --> 01:38:00,870
In bed with your
innocent sister.

868
01:38:08,716 --> 01:38:13,619
Just the thought of rape
enrages the public prosecutor.

869
01:38:15,055 --> 01:38:19,651
won't he kill when he
sees his sister being raped?

870
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:31,137
There's no doubt that Khan
was killed by Munna alias Mahesh

871
01:38:31,739 --> 01:38:34,139
But with the young age of
the accused and circumstances..

872
01:38:35,009 --> 01:38:38,945
The court sentences Munna to
1 year of rigorous imprisonment

873
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:44,683
On the basis of doubt, the court
sets Khan's accomplices free.

874
01:38:45,185 --> 01:38:47,119
My Lord, this is injustice!

875
01:38:47,788 --> 01:38:51,189
You're punishing innocents
while setting the guilty free!

876
01:38:51,792 --> 01:38:53,225
Is this just?

877
01:38:53,794 --> 01:38:55,989
Don't brand me a murderer!

878
01:38:56,530 --> 01:38:58,122
Don't ruin my life!

879
01:39:00,734 --> 01:39:02,463
Take back your judgment!

880
01:39:03,737 --> 01:39:06,171
Don't leave! Your Honour!!

881
01:39:08,742 --> 01:39:10,175
Brother...

882
01:39:18,786 --> 01:39:20,447
Now what will happen?

883
01:39:21,188 --> 01:39:25,716
I asked myself this
when our parents died.

884
01:39:27,528 --> 01:39:29,519
Time gave me the answer.

885
01:39:30,798 --> 01:39:34,734
How will I live
one year without you?

886
01:39:35,469 --> 01:39:38,495
This is imprisonment.
They might even kill me.

887
01:39:38,806 --> 01:39:41,468
Then what will you do?
How long will you shed tears?

888
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:45,745
stop crying. You're not
a child to hold my hand!

889
01:39:46,847 --> 01:39:48,474
Learn to live alone!

890
01:39:48,849 --> 01:39:51,113
From whom should I learn?

891
01:39:51,352 --> 01:39:54,253
From life. Life
teaches everything

892
01:39:54,855 --> 01:39:56,789
The season of being
pampered is over.

893
01:39:57,858 --> 01:40:01,794
You have to fight crime,
conspiracy, deceit at every step

894
01:40:03,597 --> 01:40:05,792
I am being sentenced
but you'll be at test.

895
01:40:16,877 --> 01:40:19,311
Just one year?

896
01:40:20,914 --> 01:40:24,816
I raised my brother for
26 years as my own son..

897
01:40:25,252 --> 01:40:26,810
The punishment for killing
him is just one year?

898
01:40:27,321 --> 01:40:28,618
It's very unjust!

899
01:40:28,922 --> 01:40:30,355
Injustice.

900
01:40:30,924 --> 01:40:33,654
In your court the punishment
for murder might be one year.

901
01:40:34,261 --> 01:40:37,321
But Lotiya's court
follows only one rule!

902
01:40:38,932 --> 01:40:41,867
An eye for an eye
and a hand for a hand!

903
01:40:42,936 --> 01:40:44,528
And life for life!

904
01:40:44,938 --> 01:40:47,873
And sister for a brother!

905
01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:28,277
what's the matter?

906
01:41:28,982 --> 01:41:30,609
- They..
- who?

907
01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:33,913
You rascal!

908
01:41:34,321 --> 01:41:35,913
Don't run, scoundrels!

909
01:41:36,990 --> 01:41:38,423
I'll show each one of you!

910
01:41:40,994 --> 01:41:42,427
Cowards!

911
01:41:50,003 --> 01:41:51,937
Before going to prison,
Munna told me..

912
01:41:52,339 --> 01:41:53,931
I must look after you.

913
01:41:55,008 --> 01:41:56,441
That's why I came.

914
01:41:57,010 --> 01:42:00,878
Don't worry. One of us
will remain to protect you.

915
01:42:02,983 --> 01:42:05,918
But we can't be with
Jyoti all day and night.

916
01:42:06,653 --> 01:42:08,917
And Lotiya's men can
do anything at any time.

917
01:42:11,992 --> 01:42:15,257
There's only one cure to
this pain called Lotiya.

918
01:42:17,331 --> 01:42:19,265
shut his businesses.

919
01:42:19,666 --> 01:42:20,928
Lotiya will run away.

920
01:42:21,335 --> 01:42:24,930
How's that possible?
He runs many gambling dens.

921
01:42:26,006 --> 01:42:29,601
Even the cops don't know about
them. How'll we find out?

922
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:34,940
we'll find out.

923
01:42:54,067 --> 01:42:55,591
son of a gun!

924
01:42:55,802 --> 01:42:56,996
Telling him.

925
01:42:58,405 --> 01:43:02,933
where's the casino in this hotel?

926
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:04,943
we don't have a casino.

927
01:43:17,057 --> 01:43:19,582
He's asking me to
buy the hotel right now.

928
01:43:20,060 --> 01:43:22,585
Open up a casino
so sheikh can gamble.

929
01:43:23,063 --> 01:43:25,588
- That's not possible.
- Nothing is impossible.

930
01:43:31,071 --> 01:43:32,470
The Arab speaks Telugu!

931
01:43:44,117 --> 01:43:45,448
Brother...

932
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:48,454
May I help you?

933
01:43:50,123 --> 01:43:53,058
I'll take you to a place where
your dreams will come true.

934
01:43:55,128 --> 01:43:56,390
Come in.

935
01:44:00,133 --> 01:44:02,795
where have you brought us?
This looks like a hospital!

936
01:44:03,070 --> 01:44:05,595
Create the gambling den.
where is the casino?

937
01:44:05,806 --> 01:44:07,000
This is it.

938
01:44:08,075 --> 01:44:11,010
You'll find everything here.

939
01:44:12,079 --> 01:44:14,047
There's a winner on ever table.

940
01:44:16,516 --> 01:44:17,608
How much is at stake here?

941
01:44:18,118 --> 01:44:19,745
About a lakh or so.

942
01:44:21,121 --> 01:44:25,057
Only a lakh! The sheikh
gives a lakh to beggars.

943
01:44:26,126 --> 01:44:29,061
Take us to a bigger place.

944
01:44:29,630 --> 01:44:32,064
He's loaded. Find
a better joint!

945
01:44:35,135 --> 01:44:36,796
Okay. Follow me.

946
01:44:49,182 --> 01:44:51,116
This is our special place.

947
01:44:52,185 --> 01:44:54,119
You can bet any amount.
There's no upper limit.

948
01:44:57,190 --> 01:44:58,623
wonderful!

949
01:45:02,529 --> 01:45:05,054
He says he'll play here.

950
01:45:08,135 --> 01:45:11,730
This is your currency.
It won't do here.

951
01:45:12,139 --> 01:45:14,073
what? This money won't do?

952
01:45:14,608 --> 01:45:17,406
we do business with it.
Our money won't do? - No.

953
01:45:20,180 --> 01:45:23,581
Come to the hotel at 1 1
we'll bring your money and play!

954
01:45:24,184 --> 01:45:25,674
Yes, I will come.

955
01:45:32,192 --> 01:45:35,127
Catch them all! Let none escape.

956
01:45:49,209 --> 01:45:51,939
There's some problem at
JJ Hospital at Dongarwadi

957
01:45:52,212 --> 01:45:53,543
Come fast.

958
01:45:53,814 --> 01:45:56,146
Put all your money here.

959
01:45:57,250 --> 01:45:58,683
Fill the bag.

960
01:45:59,252 --> 01:46:01,777
what are you watching? Go!

961
01:46:02,189 --> 01:46:04,123
Hop in fast.

962
01:46:04,591 --> 01:46:06,525
- Chandi, informed the cops?
- Yes.

963
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:17,460
Nobody venture out.

964
01:46:24,211 --> 01:46:26,475
Nobody will try to get away.

965
01:46:29,583 --> 01:46:32,552
This means my doubt
was not unfounded.

966
01:46:32,853 --> 01:46:34,184
Nab the rascal!

967
01:46:38,258 --> 01:46:39,987
Run, man! Big trouble!

968
01:46:42,262 --> 01:46:45,993
There's a problem in the ration
shop behind Hanuman Temple.

969
01:46:46,266 --> 01:46:47,528
Come fast!

970
01:47:18,265 --> 01:47:20,199
Run for it!

971
01:47:25,272 --> 01:47:27,866
I've often seen
cops chasing a thief.

972
01:47:29,009 --> 01:47:32,001
Only today have I seen
the police chasing police.

973
01:47:34,314 --> 01:47:36,248
- Give me a lift..
- You fat lump..!

974
01:47:37,317 --> 01:47:38,648
Hurry!

975
01:47:44,324 --> 01:47:48,727
The Chandanwadi police raided
illegal gambling dens yesterday.

976
01:47:49,329 --> 01:47:51,957
They confiscated gambling
machines and illegal stuff.

977
01:47:52,332 --> 01:47:54,766
Lotiya Pathan, the
owner is absconding.

978
01:47:55,335 --> 01:47:58,270
The police is scouring
the city looking for him.

979
01:47:58,839 --> 01:48:00,204
That's the news.

980
01:48:14,988 --> 01:48:17,252
These boys ruined us.

981
01:48:17,657 --> 01:48:18,988
where will we go?

982
01:48:19,326 --> 01:48:21,920
They've plucked you from the
sky and crushed you into dust.

983
01:48:22,329 --> 01:48:24,991
what they did is
Babban's debt to me.

984
01:48:25,332 --> 01:48:29,268
Lotiya Pathan can leave
the world but not his dues.

985
01:48:29,736 --> 01:48:32,671
Babban will pay for it
with every drop of his blood.

986
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:42,940
Munna always asks about you
when I go to meet him in jail.

987
01:48:43,383 --> 01:48:45,214
He's counting the days
till he sees you again.

988
01:48:46,386 --> 01:48:48,047
will you meet him?

989
01:49:21,388 --> 01:49:23,322
"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9"

990
01:49:24,391 --> 01:49:27,326
"10, 1 1, 12, 13"

991
01:49:28,662 --> 01:49:31,324
" 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9"

992
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:34,731
" 10, 1 1, 12, 13"

993
01:49:35,402 --> 01:49:40,339
" I count the moments
to our meeting"

994
01:49:41,408 --> 01:49:43,342
"Come on for spring is here"

995
01:49:44,411 --> 01:49:47,847
" I count the moments
to our meeting"

996
01:49:48,448 --> 01:49:50,382
"Come on for spring is here"

997
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:33,857
" I'd sent a message on the 14th"

998
01:50:35,528 --> 01:50:37,894
" I'd come on the 15th
and so I did"

999
01:50:38,531 --> 01:50:41,466
" But you didn't peep out
from behind the curtain"

1000
01:50:42,535 --> 01:50:44,469
"l was worried
at not sighting you"

1001
01:50:45,538 --> 01:50:50,805
"l was anxious right from
morning even on the 16th"

1002
01:50:51,544 --> 01:50:53,478
"Come my beloved
for spring is here"

1003
01:51:23,543 --> 01:51:26,478
"Didn't sleep a wink on the 1th"

1004
01:51:27,580 --> 01:51:29,878
"But you didn't come
even on the 18th"

1005
01:51:31,084 --> 01:51:33,518
" I went bonkers on the 19th"

1006
01:51:34,587 --> 01:51:36,851
"l left home on the 20th"

1007
01:51:37,991 --> 01:51:42,519
"The admirers cry
echoes in the lanes"

1008
01:52:31,611 --> 01:52:33,135
Mohini, listen to me!

1009
01:52:33,947 --> 01:52:35,812
You're screaming in the library.

1010
01:52:43,656 --> 01:52:46,591
"You came neither on
the 21st nor the 22nd"

1011
01:52:47,660 --> 01:52:49,924
"when I didn't find
you on the 23rd or 24th"

1012
01:52:51,164 --> 01:52:53,598
"Everybody tried to talk
sense to me on the 25th"

1013
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:56,994
"Don't take your life on the 26th"

1014
01:52:57,670 --> 01:53:03,040
"l have only 4 days
left in this world"

1015
01:53:27,667 --> 01:53:31,068
"A day feels like a week
and a week feels like months"

1016
01:53:31,671 --> 01:53:33,605
"Months run into years"

1017
01:53:34,674 --> 01:53:40,271
"Come only to see my state"

1018
01:53:41,714 --> 01:53:44,649
" I move around like a madman"

1019
01:53:45,718 --> 01:53:48,152
" I neither die nor live"

1020
01:53:49,055 --> 01:53:51,649
" My nights are lonely"

1021
01:53:52,725 --> 01:53:55,455
"Come to me, come on!"

1022
01:53:55,728 --> 01:53:58,663
" Be mine for I keep
counting the days"

1023
01:54:03,670 --> 01:54:07,606
" 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9"

1024
01:54:08,408 --> 01:54:10,376
" 10, 1 1, 12, 13"

1025
01:54:58,791 --> 01:55:00,418
saxena is waiting for
you to come for rehearsal.

1026
01:55:00,727 --> 01:55:03,161
The other girls have come.
For whom are you waiting?

1027
01:55:03,463 --> 01:55:04,657
Is your husband coming by?

1028
01:55:05,732 --> 01:55:08,462
That's right! Munna is
being released today.

1029
01:55:08,735 --> 01:55:11,329
- He'll come straight here!
- Then he won't go back alive!

1030
01:55:11,738 --> 01:55:14,673
- Get ready to go.
- I'll die but not move!

1031
01:55:15,074 --> 01:55:18,669
You can die for that rascal
but not live for your father!

1032
01:55:19,245 --> 01:55:21,179
- I'll see that you go!
- I won't dance today!

1033
01:55:21,781 --> 01:55:24,113
- Your Pop too will dance!
- Let me go!

1034
01:55:26,786 --> 01:55:29,482
Your Munna can never
get to this house.

1035
01:55:33,793 --> 01:55:37,729
You'll rot here till
you are willing to dance!

1036
01:55:38,531 --> 01:55:41,500
Let me see how long your
last without water and food!

1037
01:56:02,121 --> 01:56:03,713
where are you barging in?

1038
01:56:04,023 --> 01:56:06,184
- wait at the gate.
- Get out!

1039
01:56:07,794 --> 01:56:09,728
You'll regret this
when I frame you!

1040
01:56:10,797 --> 01:56:13,493
Move out of my way!
Take this money!

1041
01:56:15,802 --> 01:56:17,531
Now you'll never get Mohini.

1042
01:56:18,538 --> 01:56:20,733
- Don't scream her name.
- Mohini! Answer me!

1043
01:56:22,809 --> 01:56:24,242
scream louder!

1044
01:56:34,854 --> 01:56:37,186
Now you can't separate
us for very long.

1045
01:56:37,857 --> 01:56:43,295
I'll tear the earth apart and
get her even from the netherland!

1046
01:56:47,867 --> 01:56:49,300
Munna, you've come?

1047
01:56:50,370 --> 01:56:52,304
I knew you would come.

1048
01:56:53,873 --> 01:56:56,569
Father said..you won't find me.

1049
01:56:57,210 --> 01:57:01,078
But I was confident
that you'd find me.

1050
01:57:02,849 --> 01:57:05,181
You must never leave me.

1051
01:57:07,854 --> 01:57:10,186
stupid girl!
Munna will never return!

1052
01:57:10,857 --> 01:57:12,290
what happened to him?

1053
01:57:12,859 --> 01:57:14,793
I heard that somebody
beat the life out of him.

1054
01:57:15,028 --> 01:57:16,290
- You are lying!
- Your Munna is dead!

1055
01:57:16,863 --> 01:57:19,058
- No! - First his fingers
were chopped off one by one.

1056
01:57:19,532 --> 01:57:22,592
I wish you could've seen
there's only a stub no finger.

1057
01:57:22,869 --> 01:57:24,803
- No! - Then his
legs were chopped off.

1058
01:57:25,271 --> 01:57:27,603
He was screaming, let me go
Don't handicap me!

1059
01:57:28,207 --> 01:57:31,608
- One stroke and Munna went
from 5'10 to 3'10 - No!

1060
01:57:32,145 --> 01:57:35,808
when the axe landed on his chest
he had only one word on his lips..

1061
01:57:37,917 --> 01:57:40,852
- No! - You'd have seen
the blood in his veins...

1062
01:57:41,921 --> 01:57:43,855
..flow onto the road
and spill all around.

1063
01:57:49,195 --> 01:57:53,325
- I fired him. - why?
- I suffered losses.

1064
01:57:54,700 --> 01:57:56,861
Everyone was flattering him!

1065
01:57:57,937 --> 01:57:59,666
And eating and
drinking tea for free.

1066
01:57:59,939 --> 01:58:01,406
He blew up Rs. 135.

1067
01:58:02,642 --> 01:58:05,236
If I see him here,
I'll break his legs!

1068
01:58:07,914 --> 01:58:09,404
You're back!

1069
01:58:09,916 --> 01:58:13,818
I'm here as a customer.
I'll pay for the tea.

1070
01:58:14,253 --> 01:58:15,811
- Here you are
- Okay.

1071
01:58:17,657 --> 01:58:19,852
- No snacks?
- Two omelettes.

1072
01:58:21,928 --> 01:58:24,522
You'll get neither
tea nor snacks!

1073
01:58:24,931 --> 01:58:26,865
Now you owe me Rs. 135!

1074
01:58:33,940 --> 01:58:35,669
I was looking for you.

1075
01:58:36,943 --> 01:58:39,878
- why?
- You're looking for Mohini.

1076
01:58:40,980 --> 01:58:42,641
- Yes.
- I know where she is.

1077
01:58:45,985 --> 01:58:49,716
- How did you find out?
- There's a house near my workplace

1078
01:58:49,989 --> 01:58:51,923
Mohini is trapped there.

1079
01:59:29,228 --> 01:59:30,820
They are back to beat me up.

1080
01:59:31,230 --> 01:59:32,629
why don't you kill me?

1081
01:59:33,966 --> 01:59:35,160
I want to die!

1082
01:59:37,236 --> 01:59:39,170
I want to die!
why don't you kill me?

1083
01:59:39,572 --> 01:59:44,168
Like you killed my Munna!
No..I won't dance!

1084
01:59:45,244 --> 01:59:47,178
I won't dance! Kill me!

1085
01:59:48,281 --> 01:59:51,216
I don't want to live!

1086
01:59:51,784 --> 01:59:53,217
I don't want to live!

1087
01:59:55,288 --> 01:59:57,722
I plead with you! Kill me!

1088
02:00:05,298 --> 02:00:06,731
It's me, Munna.

1089
02:00:13,306 --> 02:00:15,240
- Are you Munna?
- Yes..

1090
02:00:25,017 --> 02:00:26,951
I thought they'd killed you

1091
02:00:36,362 --> 02:00:38,296
How did you know
I was imprisoned here?

1092
02:00:39,365 --> 02:00:42,095
Guldasta from the canteen told me

1093
02:00:42,702 --> 02:00:44,636
- The singer..?
- Yes.

1094
02:00:45,371 --> 02:00:48,101
But..I saw him meet
my father a few days ago.

1095
02:00:49,375 --> 02:00:51,309
- Guldasta?
- Yes.

1096
02:00:54,380 --> 02:00:55,813
Open the door!

1097
02:00:56,415 --> 02:00:58,110
There's something fishy.
It's a trick.

1098
02:00:58,684 --> 02:01:01,744
- I'll check.. - No!
- I'll break down the door!

1099
02:01:02,688 --> 02:01:03,950
I'm scared.

1100
02:01:04,357 --> 02:01:09,294
This year was very difficult.
I can't live without you!

1101
02:01:09,762 --> 02:01:11,286
I'll kill myself!

1102
02:01:11,697 --> 02:01:13,631
- But how can l..?
- I don't care!

1103
02:01:14,367 --> 02:01:15,766
Go away from here!

1104
02:01:16,369 --> 02:01:17,768
Go away!

1105
02:01:20,373 --> 02:01:22,307
Girl, open the door!

1106
02:01:27,380 --> 02:01:30,110
- Go...
- Break open the door.

1107
02:01:35,087 --> 02:01:36,679
You've got me in trouble.

1108
02:01:36,922 --> 02:01:40,688
I did all for you. I gave you
news about Mohini and Munna.

1109
02:01:40,926 --> 02:01:42,154
Got Munna in trouble.

1110
02:01:42,428 --> 02:01:46,159
Leave alone Laxmikant Pyarelal,
you didn't take me to a band.

1111
02:01:46,699 --> 02:01:48,860
- I'll do it, man.
- lsn't it too late?

1112
02:01:49,168 --> 02:01:53,161
Munna escaped from the cops
and now he's on my tail!

1113
02:01:53,439 --> 02:01:55,031
why are you so frightened?

1114
02:01:56,442 --> 02:01:58,706
In any case, he's been framed
for stealing from my house.

1115
02:01:59,445 --> 02:02:04,314
And if you're so scared, take
this money and go to your village

1116
02:02:04,583 --> 02:02:05,845
No, shyamlal.

1117
02:02:06,819 --> 02:02:09,310
Guldasta will go to the
police station not his village.

1118
02:02:09,822 --> 02:02:11,312
Now I'm dead.

1119
02:02:12,425 --> 02:02:14,689
sir, don't beat me!
I'm just a singer.

1120
02:02:14,927 --> 02:02:16,155
I'll confess.

1121
02:02:16,696 --> 02:02:20,154
Actually shyamlal is behind this.

1122
02:02:20,433 --> 02:02:21,866
Ask him, isn't it?

1123
02:02:24,437 --> 02:02:25,768
Take his statement.

1124
02:02:26,439 --> 02:02:27,963
- Come along.
- I'll confess all.

1125
02:02:28,441 --> 02:02:29,772
Take a seat.

1126
02:02:30,443 --> 02:02:35,142
Now you can guess how
wicked shyamlal can be.

1127
02:02:35,881 --> 02:02:37,109
Only last year he..

1128
02:02:44,824 --> 02:02:47,759
Inspector, that's Guldasta yelling

1129
02:02:48,227 --> 02:02:51,219
Don't yell. This is a police
station not a college canteen.

1130
02:02:51,497 --> 02:02:54,432
They're beating him up.
It's all wrong!

1131
02:02:54,900 --> 02:02:57,425
we know what's right and what's not

1132
02:02:57,903 --> 02:03:01,771
Is this a new law to beat
a witness to take his statement?

1133
02:03:05,444 --> 02:03:07,844
Here's his statement.
He confessed to his crime.

1134
02:03:10,483 --> 02:03:14,385
Here's the money that he and
Munna stole from shyamlal.

1135
02:03:14,820 --> 02:03:16,788
- sir, what's going on?
- shut up!

1136
02:03:17,490 --> 02:03:18,923
Lock this thug up.

1137
02:03:25,498 --> 02:03:27,432
You took a bribe from shyamlal!

1138
02:03:27,833 --> 02:03:29,164
He bribed you!

1139
02:03:30,503 --> 02:03:32,437
Did you take the bribe?
Answer me!!

1140
02:03:33,906 --> 02:03:36,431
Men like you will ruin this nation!

1141
02:03:37,009 --> 02:03:39,034
Ruin the country! Get out!

1142
02:03:41,514 --> 02:03:42,981
Hold him back!

1143
02:03:43,549 --> 02:03:44,982
Leave him!

1144
02:03:46,552 --> 02:03:48,486
I won't spare you!
You want to frame me!

1145
02:03:50,556 --> 02:03:53,150
Don't spare the rascal!

1146
02:03:56,562 --> 02:03:59,998
- won't spare you!
- Lock the scoundrel up!

1147
02:04:00,499 --> 02:04:02,160
You come out!

1148
02:04:03,502 --> 02:04:05,697
You son of a bitch!
I'll show you now!

1149
02:04:06,505 --> 02:04:08,439
step outside and I'll show you!

1150
02:04:10,509 --> 02:04:12,773
I'll show you in here!
Calling me out!

1151
02:04:20,553 --> 02:04:22,282
Beating up a cop!

1152
02:04:22,555 --> 02:04:26,457
You dog! You will
whip me with your belt!

1153
02:04:30,963 --> 02:04:35,491
On the basis of the evidence,
testimonies of the witnesses...

1154
02:04:36,068 --> 02:04:37,501
The court has reached this decision

1155
02:04:38,571 --> 02:04:41,506
Mahesh Deshmukh alias Munna
went to shyamlal's house..

1156
02:04:42,575 --> 02:04:45,237
..on the night of
Feb 14, to plunder him.

1157
02:04:46,178 --> 02:04:48,510
He conned the police
and fled from there.

1158
02:04:49,615 --> 02:04:54,951
Then on the 15th of Feb, with his
accomplice Abbasali, Guldasta...

1159
02:04:55,621 --> 02:04:57,555
They stole from shyamlal's house

1160
02:04:58,290 --> 02:05:05,219
The court sentences Abbasali
alias Guldasta to 1 years Rl

1161
02:05:06,232 --> 02:05:09,497
and Munna whom the
citiZens of this city fear

1162
02:05:10,569 --> 02:05:12,901
..is sent to exile from
the city for a whole year.

1163
02:05:14,573 --> 02:05:18,304
During this period he has no
permission to enter the city.

1164
02:05:49,642 --> 02:05:54,375
sir, now do you understand
why I don't trust you cops.

1165
02:05:59,451 --> 02:06:03,319
But I will be glad to
bring back your trust.

1166
02:06:03,622 --> 02:06:05,283
You'll have to pay a price for it.

1167
02:06:05,624 --> 02:06:10,561
I can pay any price to
turn Munna back to Mahesh.

1168
02:06:10,963 --> 02:06:12,828
Then give me 24 hours.

1169
02:06:13,966 --> 02:06:16,901
Trust me so I can trust you.

1170
02:06:18,971 --> 02:06:21,565
All right. I'll wait for you.

1171
02:06:22,308 --> 02:06:23,570
stop the vehicle.

1172
02:06:54,707 --> 02:06:56,641
- How are you?
- My father is your enemy.

1173
02:06:57,176 --> 02:06:59,644
He took a loan from you
why are you punishing me?

1174
02:07:00,045 --> 02:07:02,570
what does your lecherous
father have for me to take?

1175
02:07:03,682 --> 02:07:06,242
You can pay my debt
and his interests.

1176
02:07:06,685 --> 02:07:10,587
I have many who will
pay for your beauty.

1177
02:07:12,358 --> 02:07:14,952
who will pay off the father's
debts if not his children?

1178
02:07:16,695 --> 02:07:19,630
You'll pay the first
installment of my loan.

1179
02:07:20,366 --> 02:07:21,628
Be ready.

1180
02:07:53,766 --> 02:07:56,030
Finding Mohini in this
sprawling place is tough.

1181
02:07:57,770 --> 02:07:59,203
God knows which dark
dungeon she must be in.

1182
02:08:00,039 --> 02:08:03,440
Let's spread out in this place.

1183
02:08:04,710 --> 02:08:08,441
The one who finds news
of her first informs us.

1184
02:08:19,758 --> 02:08:22,192
she's from a good family

1185
02:08:22,761 --> 02:08:24,695
Is she's from a good family
are we from bad families?

1186
02:08:25,097 --> 02:08:26,496
Are these girls from bad families?

1187
02:08:26,765 --> 02:08:30,701
How will I claim the cash paid to
your stepfather unless you work?

1188
02:08:31,103 --> 02:08:32,968
I beg you! Let me go!

1189
02:08:33,272 --> 02:08:36,207
Let me go! I can't do this!

1190
02:08:36,442 --> 02:08:37,704
I'll somehow pay you back!

1191
02:09:27,826 --> 02:09:30,761
- what's happening?
- He tried to run away last night

1192
02:09:31,163 --> 02:09:32,494
says, he won't lift burdens.

1193
02:09:34,833 --> 02:09:36,767
scoundrel! Beating up a child!

1194
02:09:46,845 --> 02:09:48,779
- Mohini has been sighted!
- Run!

1195
02:09:57,890 --> 02:09:59,414
You stay here. I'll get Mohini.

1196
02:10:51,310 --> 02:10:52,902
You dark rascal! Take this!

1197
02:10:59,017 --> 02:11:01,281
Is that it? Okay, fine...

1198
02:11:01,954 --> 02:11:04,889
Don't let go. Hold tight.

1199
02:11:59,044 --> 02:12:01,911
Run with me, kids! Hurry!

1200
02:12:13,759 --> 02:12:17,695
she must be around. I'll skin
each of you if she gets away!

1201
02:12:52,097 --> 02:12:56,033
You can't get out
of my colony alive.

1202
02:12:56,868 --> 02:12:59,029
Of course I will.

1203
02:13:00,105 --> 02:13:01,572
And you'll escort me out.

1204
02:13:03,041 --> 02:13:04,303
Come on!

1205
02:13:15,087 --> 02:13:18,488
Move back! Act smart and
I'll stab the Pathan!

1206
02:13:19,091 --> 02:13:20,752
Come on!

1207
02:13:32,604 --> 02:13:35,038
Even your foes will
appreciate your courage.

1208
02:13:36,108 --> 02:13:39,043
Not a needle can get out of
this place without my consent.

1209
02:13:40,112 --> 02:13:41,545
And you're taking this girl.

1210
02:13:42,414 --> 02:13:44,041
I'm not taking just the girl.

1211
02:13:47,152 --> 02:13:51,054
Today I'll raZe your
city of sin to ashes!

1212
02:13:53,158 --> 02:13:54,853
stop him!

1213
02:14:21,153 --> 02:14:25,487
what fun! Long live children!

1214
02:14:39,171 --> 02:14:40,536
Is that so?

1215
02:15:33,225 --> 02:15:36,160
You are now free.
Go back to your homes!

1216
02:15:36,561 --> 02:15:38,153
Hurry up!

1217
02:15:46,238 --> 02:15:51,175
After this day there's only
one aim of Lotiya Pathan's life.

1218
02:15:53,245 --> 02:15:54,678
Munna's death!

1219
02:16:08,226 --> 02:16:10,160
Now I won't let you
stay away from me.

1220
02:16:10,829 --> 02:16:12,160
Not for a moment!

1221
02:16:13,965 --> 02:16:18,163
You have no idea what hell
I went through in this one year!

1222
02:16:19,237 --> 02:16:21,171
I never slept a wink.

1223
02:16:22,240 --> 02:16:26,609
I got accustomed to fainting
when they'd constantly whip me.

1224
02:16:27,245 --> 02:16:29,179
Once I wanted to kill myself

1225
02:16:30,615 --> 02:16:33,175
But I didn't because it
concerns both our lives.

1226
02:16:37,289 --> 02:16:41,988
Now I leave the decision to you
Take me wherever you want.

1227
02:16:42,294 --> 02:16:44,228
Poison me if you want.

1228
02:16:44,696 --> 02:16:46,687
But now I can't live without you!

1229
02:16:50,302 --> 02:16:54,238
I want to give up everything
The singing and dancing..

1230
02:16:55,307 --> 02:16:57,241
That palatial house..
fame, wealth...everything!

1231
02:16:57,709 --> 02:16:59,233
Have you lost your mind?

1232
02:17:00,579 --> 02:17:03,673
what do you have if not for
your name, wealth, house?

1233
02:17:04,282 --> 02:17:05,943
that I must take with me

1234
02:17:09,287 --> 02:17:11,221
what...are you saying?

1235
02:17:11,623 --> 02:17:15,491
Just what you heard. If you
can't give me a comfortable life..

1236
02:17:15,694 --> 02:17:17,218
what is the point of your love?

1237
02:17:19,297 --> 02:17:20,992
Is that why you loved me?

1238
02:17:21,299 --> 02:17:24,234
If a real father loves
expecting wealth in return.

1239
02:17:25,303 --> 02:17:27,237
Have I done wrong
if I also expected it?

1240
02:17:28,907 --> 02:17:31,239
- what do you want?
- same as your Pop.

1241
02:17:31,710 --> 02:17:35,578
I want you to sing and
dance and make money for me.

1242
02:17:36,348 --> 02:17:38,646
- Because I have the right.
- You are lying!

1243
02:17:39,351 --> 02:17:42,548
- You are lying!
- That's not the issue here.

1244
02:17:43,355 --> 02:17:44,686
This is true.

1245
02:17:45,357 --> 02:17:50,090
Living out of bounds with
thieves for a whole year..

1246
02:17:50,862 --> 02:17:52,796
I have understood what
the world is all about.

1247
02:17:54,366 --> 02:17:56,300
Neither love nor dreams
work in this world.

1248
02:17:58,370 --> 02:18:00,031
Even I loved my dreams.

1249
02:18:00,805 --> 02:18:02,238
But what did I get?

1250
02:18:02,641 --> 02:18:04,700
I thought my dreams
were in my hand.

1251
02:18:05,310 --> 02:18:08,245
But I never realised when
they slipped out of my hand.

1252
02:18:11,349 --> 02:18:13,909
similarly your Munna
too has changed.

1253
02:18:14,352 --> 02:18:16,286
His dreams have changed!
This is also true!

1254
02:18:17,355 --> 02:18:19,084
Now he dreams of becoming rich.

1255
02:18:19,624 --> 02:18:21,615
Of acquiring every
luxury life can offer!

1256
02:18:22,360 --> 02:18:26,296
And he will do
anything to acquire it!

1257
02:18:27,098 --> 02:18:28,292
You are lying.

1258
02:18:29,134 --> 02:18:32,297
If this were true, why would
you come here to rescue me?

1259
02:18:33,038 --> 02:18:34,699
why would you save
your love from ruin?

1260
02:18:35,040 --> 02:18:37,804
Do you think I came
here for your love?

1261
02:18:39,177 --> 02:18:42,044
stupid girl! I had
a deal with your Pop.

1262
02:18:43,181 --> 02:18:46,947
He's promised me Rs. 50000
if I got you back.

1263
02:18:48,153 --> 02:18:50,348
- we have a contract.
- You are lying!!

1264
02:18:50,755 --> 02:18:53,121
You are lying!
Don't joke with me!

1265
02:18:53,425 --> 02:18:55,359
I won't be able to bear it!

1266
02:18:56,094 --> 02:18:58,358
say that you were joking!

1267
02:18:58,763 --> 02:18:59,092
It's the truth!

1268
02:19:27,425 --> 02:19:32,761
"The earth and the
sky are fast asleep"

1269
02:19:33,431 --> 02:19:39,370
"The earth and the
sky are fast asleep"

1270
02:19:40,438 --> 02:19:44,374
"Every destination is asleep"

1271
02:19:45,443 --> 02:19:47,707
" Every destination.."

1272
02:19:49,180 --> 02:19:51,148
"The roads too are asleep"

1273
02:19:52,484 --> 02:19:57,387
"The earth and the
sky are fast asleep"

1274
02:19:58,490 --> 02:20:02,426
" Every destination is asleep"

1275
02:20:04,496 --> 02:20:06,430
" Every destination.."

1276
02:20:07,499 --> 02:20:09,433
"The roads too are asleep"

1277
02:20:57,282 --> 02:21:04,120
"when night came, those with
homes went home to sleep"

1278
02:21:06,991 --> 02:21:15,490
"while we wandered the
streets and got lost"

1279
02:21:18,570 --> 02:21:20,504
"This lane and that.."

1280
02:21:21,573 --> 02:21:24,007
"This city and that.."

1281
02:21:24,576 --> 02:21:29,309
"where do we go
even if we'd like to?"

1282
02:21:31,616 --> 02:21:35,518
" Every destination is asleep"

1283
02:22:58,703 --> 02:23:00,227
" Hear my words.."

1284
02:23:02,040 --> 02:23:03,564
"say something to me"

1285
02:23:05,643 --> 02:23:10,307
" Don't be silent when
you are close to me"

1286
02:23:11,950 --> 02:23:17,354
"we are close yet we are far"

1287
02:23:18,690 --> 02:23:23,627
"we are free yet helpless"

1288
02:23:25,096 --> 02:23:30,625
"why did love change?"

1289
02:23:32,103 --> 02:23:37,370
"why did the world
win against us?"

1290
02:23:38,710 --> 02:23:43,647
"My heart is clamped by sorrows"

1291
02:23:45,750 --> 02:23:50,153
" Life is filled with darkness"

1292
02:23:52,757 --> 02:23:57,160
"Only darkness"

1293
02:23:58,763 --> 02:24:02,631
"Every destination is asleep?

1294
02:24:45,176 --> 02:24:47,701
Old crook, here's your babe!

1295
02:24:48,112 --> 02:24:50,478
- Baby is back!
- Pay me up.

1296
02:24:50,815 --> 02:24:54,216
- what's that?
- Cash 50000.

1297
02:24:55,820 --> 02:24:58,550
Remember or do I have
to jog your memory?

1298
02:24:58,823 --> 02:25:00,222
what do you have to remind me?

1299
02:25:00,425 --> 02:25:02,689
No point arguing with such a man

1300
02:25:03,027 --> 02:25:06,087
- Pay him.
- I must pay him?

1301
02:25:06,364 --> 02:25:08,696
- From where?
- I gave you 50000 that day!

1302
02:25:09,167 --> 02:25:11,692
saying anyway he might bring
Mohini and we'll have to pay him!

1303
02:25:12,170 --> 02:25:14,502
He'll fight if we don't pay.
Didn't I pay you?

1304
02:25:14,772 --> 02:25:17,707
Yes but I spent it.
Come back when I have cash.

1305
02:25:19,777 --> 02:25:24,510
Enough of your drama. Your
babe is back. Now pay me!

1306
02:25:24,816 --> 02:25:26,511
what will you do
if I don't pay up?

1307
02:25:34,826 --> 02:25:38,023
This broad will stay
with me till I get paid.

1308
02:25:38,830 --> 02:25:40,491
Pay up and take her.

1309
02:25:41,566 --> 02:25:43,090
- stop him!
- wait..

1310
02:25:43,568 --> 02:25:46,765
I'll pay your price.
Here, count it.

1311
02:25:48,306 --> 02:25:50,433
I know your accounts
can never be wrong.

1312
02:25:52,844 --> 02:25:55,779
- Call me if needed.
- sure.

1313
02:26:03,221 --> 02:26:05,553
You degraded yourself in
Mohini's eyes like this?

1314
02:26:05,823 --> 02:26:07,757
Brother, for what are
you punishing yourself?

1315
02:26:08,159 --> 02:26:10,093
- what else could I do?
- You could've accepted her.

1316
02:26:10,828 --> 02:26:13,763
- she'd get a home and l'd
get a sister-in-law. - lmpossible

1317
02:26:14,832 --> 02:26:16,766
I'll do what you
consider impossible!

1318
02:26:17,168 --> 02:26:19,762
I'll tell her the truth and
see how you put her off!

1319
02:26:22,840 --> 02:26:25,775
Don't be a fool!
You want to give her a home

1320
02:26:26,511 --> 02:26:28,035
saxena too can give her a home!

1321
02:26:28,646 --> 02:26:30,773
I am in exile. The
cops are on my tail!

1322
02:26:31,215 --> 02:26:33,376
I run out of land to flee!

1323
02:26:33,684 --> 02:26:35,413
How will I give her a home?

1324
02:26:36,888 --> 02:26:40,289
I will be sorry that l
couldn't give you a sister-in-law

1325
02:26:40,892 --> 02:26:43,156
- And love...?
- Love will remain.

1326
02:26:43,895 --> 02:26:47,490
As hatred in her heart
and a wound in mine.

1327
02:26:51,903 --> 02:26:53,495
This is money!

1328
02:26:53,905 --> 02:26:58,308
Yes. Now what you have to do
is start a decent business.

1329
02:26:58,910 --> 02:27:01,777
something small
but make a beginning.

1330
02:27:03,214 --> 02:27:05,148
For many days we had a dream.

1331
02:27:05,550 --> 02:27:06,778
we start a small garage.

1332
02:27:07,885 --> 02:27:10,445
In one sweep, you made is so easy.

1333
02:27:10,888 --> 02:27:12,583
How do we thank you?

1334
02:27:12,890 --> 02:27:16,485
Give you one punch! There are
promises no thanks between pals

1335
02:27:16,894 --> 02:27:21,627
From today your faces will
be seen in Babban & Co. Garage

1336
02:27:21,899 --> 02:27:23,594
Not on the roads!

1337
02:27:24,635 --> 02:27:25,829
Promise?

1338
02:27:48,960 --> 02:27:50,894
I've kept my word.

1339
02:27:54,966 --> 02:27:58,163
The man brought before you...

1340
02:27:58,970 --> 02:28:00,494
His crime is not only that..

1341
02:28:00,905 --> 02:28:02,839
He broke the order of exile

1342
02:28:03,674 --> 02:28:06,837
The book of his crimes is
as filthy as it is thick!

1343
02:28:08,913 --> 02:28:11,882
Even after serving a year long
sentence for murdering innocent..

1344
02:28:12,350 --> 02:28:14,284
The accused Munna
didn't learn a lesson!

1345
02:28:14,952 --> 02:28:17,887
He went to the judge's farm house!

1346
02:28:18,956 --> 02:28:22,892
Relation with Guldasta
to steal from shyamlal!

1347
02:28:23,961 --> 02:28:27,897
Attempt to kill the
honourable lnspector Gupta!

1348
02:28:29,300 --> 02:28:35,637
It seems this man is waging war
against all good men in the city!

1349
02:28:35,973 --> 02:28:40,910
Crime and sin is the
only passion of such men!

1350
02:28:41,646 --> 02:28:44,911
such killers should be
kept away from society!

1351
02:28:45,750 --> 02:28:48,685
Because he's the acid that
will destroy everything..

1352
02:28:49,020 --> 02:28:51,284
..if it spills out of
the jar of the prison cell!

1353
02:28:51,489 --> 02:28:53,923
Yes, I am acid!!

1354
02:28:54,759 --> 02:28:55,953
I am acid.

1355
02:28:58,696 --> 02:29:00,561
I admit that I am acid.

1356
02:29:00,965 --> 02:29:03,627
But I'd like to ask
where did the acid come from?

1357
02:29:03,968 --> 02:29:06,903
I ask you and the
Public Prosecutor..

1358
02:29:07,305 --> 02:29:10,706
and every person
sitting in this hall..

1359
02:29:10,975 --> 02:29:12,636
How was this acid created?

1360
02:29:14,578 --> 02:29:17,547
My Lord, this acid wasn't
created in my mother's womb!

1361
02:29:18,015 --> 02:29:22,418
The boy in NCC uniform who
swore to die for his nation..

1362
02:29:23,020 --> 02:29:26,922
He kept his promise even
after losing his parents.

1363
02:29:27,358 --> 02:29:28,950
That boy was me!

1364
02:29:29,527 --> 02:29:32,462
I, Mahesh Deshmukh was not acid!

1365
02:29:45,042 --> 02:29:46,475
Julie, get me 1 large.

1366
02:29:48,045 --> 02:29:49,478
I wager 500

1367
02:29:49,714 --> 02:29:50,976
what's happening?

1368
02:29:53,351 --> 02:29:54,978
Nothing, just having some fun.

1369
02:29:55,486 --> 02:29:56,976
I too bet 500.

1370
02:29:57,421 --> 02:30:00,686
when you have fun in uniform,
what do you do when on duty?

1371
02:30:01,092 --> 02:30:03,424
Let me continue.
I've got 3000 on the line.

1372
02:30:04,895 --> 02:30:07,762
when duty becomes fun and the
gambler plays with the uniformed..

1373
02:30:08,099 --> 02:30:10,533
..instead of being scared..

1374
02:30:11,102 --> 02:30:15,038
It's not just a few bucks but
the fate of the nation at stake.

1375
02:30:16,107 --> 02:30:17,836
what do you want to prove?

1376
02:30:18,776 --> 02:30:20,038
Nothing.

1377
02:30:22,113 --> 02:30:24,377
You used police force to
prove a falsehood to be true.

1378
02:30:25,149 --> 02:30:28,084
I want to exhibit the same
power to prove the truth.

1379
02:30:28,486 --> 02:30:30,420
what truth and what lies?

1380
02:30:32,156 --> 02:30:33,418
Look at this belt.

1381
02:30:34,492 --> 02:30:35,754
Recall something?

1382
02:30:52,176 --> 02:30:53,609
I don't recall a thing.

1383
02:30:54,178 --> 02:30:56,806
- see you.
- lnspector, stop!

1384
02:30:58,215 --> 02:30:59,705
Everything will
come flooding back!

1385
02:31:00,885 --> 02:31:03,080
This belt will bring
back your memory.

1386
02:31:03,487 --> 02:31:05,079
I too have a belt.

1387
02:31:05,890 --> 02:31:07,414
Merely having a belt
doesn't suffice!

1388
02:31:09,160 --> 02:31:12,425
The hands corroded by accepting
bribes and betraying their duty...

1389
02:31:13,164 --> 02:31:16,099
They can't lift the belt
forget about using it!

1390
02:31:16,600 --> 02:31:21,094
It is your soul, your conscience
that stands before you, not me!

1391
02:31:22,173 --> 02:31:25,108
The hands of every traitor
are bound before the soul!

1392
02:31:29,180 --> 02:31:30,613
which innocent did
you hit with the belt?

1393
02:31:33,951 --> 02:31:35,111
what did you do with him?

1394
02:31:36,220 --> 02:31:37,653
I framed him!

1395
02:31:37,888 --> 02:31:40,914
- How did you frame him?
- with false testimony!

1396
02:31:41,225 --> 02:31:42,556
How did you do that?

1397
02:31:46,230 --> 02:31:49,165
- Guldasta's testimony!
- How did you get that?

1398
02:31:53,237 --> 02:31:54,829
By beating him.

1399
02:31:56,240 --> 02:31:58,572
Your memory is better than
that of a wild elephant!

1400
02:31:59,510 --> 02:32:01,842
The memory better remain
intact till we reach court.

1401
02:32:02,179 --> 02:32:03,840
That's in your interest.

1402
02:32:05,983 --> 02:32:08,747
I've said all that I could recall

1403
02:32:10,221 --> 02:32:12,155
Munna..is innocent.

1404
02:32:12,823 --> 02:32:16,759
But overcome by greed
I proved him guilty

1405
02:32:17,228 --> 02:32:20,959
with lnspector Gupta's
testimony in mind...

1406
02:32:21,499 --> 02:32:26,960
The court takes back the
accusations on Mahesh Deshmukh.

1407
02:32:27,638 --> 02:32:33,167
And orders legal inquiry
into lnspector Gupta's case.

1408
02:32:36,247 --> 02:32:40,183
In spite of all the
injustice you underwent..

1409
02:32:41,285 --> 02:32:44,220
This society and
country is your own.

1410
02:32:45,022 --> 02:32:47,217
Your father became
a martyr for this nation.

1411
02:32:48,692 --> 02:32:50,683
You can't get angry
from it and go anywhere.

1412
02:32:51,295 --> 02:32:52,728
what can I do all by myself?

1413
02:32:53,030 --> 02:32:55,726
A lot. Everyone waits
for another to take action.

1414
02:32:56,300 --> 02:32:57,699
some group or the government..

1415
02:32:58,302 --> 02:33:00,236
waiting for that,
nobody does anything.

1416
02:33:00,738 --> 02:33:06,176
Branded as a criminal, what's
possible for me in this city?

1417
02:33:06,577 --> 02:33:08,169
Not here, in Goa.

1418
02:33:08,579 --> 02:33:11,673
My friend has a shipping agency
I spoke to him about you.

1419
02:33:12,283 --> 02:33:15,775
Go there and begin life afresh.

1420
02:33:24,295 --> 02:33:26,820
Guldasta..? Come in.

1421
02:33:28,299 --> 02:33:29,891
How did you come here?

1422
02:33:31,302 --> 02:33:33,236
I've come to apologise.

1423
02:33:37,041 --> 02:33:40,238
For the first time in life
I realised in prison..

1424
02:33:41,312 --> 02:33:45,248
The obsession to do something...

1425
02:33:46,350 --> 02:33:49,751
..makes man selfish and blind

1426
02:33:50,354 --> 02:33:54,017
His obsession destroys many lives

1427
02:33:56,026 --> 02:33:57,288
And he doesn't even realise it.

1428
02:33:57,695 --> 02:33:59,287
Neither you nor I can
rectify what happened.

1429
02:34:00,297 --> 02:34:01,730
Forget the past.

1430
02:34:02,299 --> 02:34:06,030
Babban told me you're leaving
this city to go to Goa for good

1431
02:34:08,639 --> 02:34:10,664
This city gave me a name, Munna

1432
02:34:11,308 --> 02:34:14,243
Then the same city gave me
another name, criminal!

1433
02:34:15,312 --> 02:34:18,645
Released from these names
with a new name in a new city..

1434
02:34:20,351 --> 02:34:21,909
I'm going to begin a new life.

1435
02:34:22,353 --> 02:34:23,684
Leaving Mohini?

1436
02:34:24,021 --> 02:34:26,285
Leaving behind everything
this city gave me.

1437
02:34:27,024 --> 02:34:28,958
Friends and foes included.

1438
02:34:29,360 --> 02:34:31,885
I won't let you go without Mohini

1439
02:34:32,630 --> 02:34:33,892
No way.

1440
02:34:40,704 --> 02:34:46,108
Relations hold back a man
and I have no relatives.

1441
02:34:46,377 --> 02:34:47,810
There is one relation.

1442
02:34:49,380 --> 02:34:52,349
And I will definitely
try to save it.

1443
02:34:55,185 --> 02:34:58,746
There's nothing between me
and Munna that can be saved!

1444
02:34:59,423 --> 02:35:03,553
No, what remains
between you and Munna...

1445
02:35:04,361 --> 02:35:06,295
I've seen it in Munna's eyes.

1446
02:35:06,764 --> 02:35:09,096
what did you see?
Lust for money?

1447
02:35:09,767 --> 02:35:12,634
For him, I'm now
just a cardboard doll.

1448
02:35:13,037 --> 02:35:15,301
He struck a deal with
my Pop to get me back!

1449
02:35:15,706 --> 02:35:17,298
And dumped me in another hell!

1450
02:35:21,378 --> 02:35:23,710
I'd given myself to him
with such trust..

1451
02:35:25,182 --> 02:35:26,877
I loved him to distraction.

1452
02:35:28,018 --> 02:35:30,680
But he..he used him
for his selfish motives!

1453
02:35:31,422 --> 02:35:33,686
Crushed my feelings afoot!

1454
02:35:34,425 --> 02:35:37,622
I hate him! I hate
the thought of him!

1455
02:35:40,431 --> 02:35:42,023
That is what he wanted.

1456
02:35:43,434 --> 02:35:44,867
That you hate him.

1457
02:35:46,437 --> 02:35:52,376
He knew you loved him
as much as he loved you.

1458
02:35:54,778 --> 02:35:56,370
Till he falls in your eyes..

1459
02:35:57,481 --> 02:35:59,108
till he becomes a
victim of your hatred...

1460
02:35:59,883 --> 02:36:01,316
You won't marry another.

1461
02:36:02,419 --> 02:36:05,752
He could bear to see you
a princess in saxena's palace.

1462
02:36:06,423 --> 02:36:11,360
But he didn't want his Mohini
to wander with a murderer!

1463
02:36:14,832 --> 02:36:18,768
Yes, he knew saxena
wanted to marry you.

1464
02:36:19,169 --> 02:36:21,103
And the money...
I saw him take it.

1465
02:36:21,438 --> 02:36:25,704
He distributed all of it
among his vagabond pals.

1466
02:36:26,443 --> 02:36:28,377
I can't change the past.

1467
02:36:29,446 --> 02:36:32,415
But I can try to stop
what must not happen.

1468
02:36:33,751 --> 02:36:38,882
when Lotiya kidnapped you,
only one hand could rescue you.

1469
02:36:39,490 --> 02:36:40,923
Munna's hand.

1470
02:36:42,059 --> 02:36:46,428
And today when he's leaving
the city for an unknown life..

1471
02:36:47,498 --> 02:36:50,934
Even then there's only one
hand to support him in the city.

1472
02:36:51,835 --> 02:36:53,097
Your hand.

1473
02:36:55,506 --> 02:36:57,906
The aim of my life is to
bring these two together.

1474
02:36:59,176 --> 02:37:01,371
Also of my death if need be.

1475
02:37:09,486 --> 02:37:10,919
Mohini, go.

1476
02:37:12,289 --> 02:37:14,416
stop. You won't go anywhere.

1477
02:37:16,493 --> 02:37:18,427
Get out, you twerp!

1478
02:37:23,500 --> 02:37:27,231
My physical body may not be strong

1479
02:37:29,173 --> 02:37:34,440
But I've strengthened
my soul in the jail.

1480
02:37:35,512 --> 02:37:39,949
And sometimes the soul
is stronger than the body!

1481
02:37:40,551 --> 02:37:41,984
Mohini, go!

1482
02:37:44,555 --> 02:37:47,490
- where are you going?
- Go!

1483
02:37:48,559 --> 02:37:51,494
Go! Nobody can stop you today!

1484
02:38:02,506 --> 02:38:04,838
No! Let go!

1485
02:39:36,633 --> 02:39:39,363
what was lacking in my love..?

1486
02:39:40,637 --> 02:39:42,366
That you wanted to test me?

1487
02:39:44,041 --> 02:39:47,977
I'll kill myself if
you won't take me this time!

1488
02:40:09,700 --> 02:40:13,101
we hear Munna is leaving
for Goa by boat tomorrow.

1489
02:40:14,705 --> 02:40:16,639
Munna can't leave me.

1490
02:40:17,374 --> 02:40:19,308
we share a blood relation.

1491
02:40:19,710 --> 02:40:21,644
His blood and my knife!

1492
02:40:22,312 --> 02:40:25,645
I promised him there'll
be only one aim of my life!

1493
02:40:26,483 --> 02:40:27,643
His death!

1494
02:40:28,151 --> 02:40:30,244
I never forget promises!

1495
02:40:30,754 --> 02:40:33,689
Munna will leave
the world not this city!

1496
02:40:38,762 --> 02:40:40,286
There's a customer!

1497
02:40:41,765 --> 02:40:44,097
He's your old customer.

1498
02:40:47,104 --> 02:40:49,698
Don't leave the steering
Hold tight!

1499
02:40:50,173 --> 02:40:53,700
Run! Or this goon
will whack your bike.

1500
02:40:59,149 --> 02:41:02,482
stop laughing and get to work.

1501
02:41:08,759 --> 02:41:11,023
Babban! Terrible news!

1502
02:41:11,762 --> 02:41:13,195
Lotiya Pathan is back!

1503
02:41:13,764 --> 02:41:16,494
He's at the dock. said
he'll kill Munnabhai!

1504
02:41:17,768 --> 02:41:21,204
He'll have to cross my
dead body to get to Munna.

1505
02:41:24,775 --> 02:41:27,972
- Munna..?
- where's Babban?

1506
02:41:28,445 --> 02:41:30,470
Lotiya is hiding in the
dockyard to kill you.

1507
02:41:30,814 --> 02:41:32,247
Babban and gang have gone to fight

1508
02:41:45,328 --> 02:41:47,762
I have a score to
settle with you too

1509
02:41:48,832 --> 02:41:50,231
Good you came here.

1510
02:41:50,500 --> 02:41:53,435
To stop you before
you get to Munna...

1511
02:41:53,837 --> 02:41:57,170
I'd follow you to the end of hell!

1512
02:41:57,841 --> 02:41:59,775
Destroy them!

1513
02:42:39,883 --> 02:42:44,081
stop. I have a score
to settle with him.

1514
02:43:41,912 --> 02:43:43,573
No!!

1515
02:43:43,914 --> 02:43:47,350
Let go! He wanted to kill you!

1516
02:43:47,951 --> 02:43:49,509
Get away!

1517
02:43:49,953 --> 02:43:52,888
He promised to kill me
You leave the dagger!

1518
02:43:53,957 --> 02:43:55,891
Your life is just starting
Make a get away!

1519
02:43:56,293 --> 02:43:58,887
No! Your life is waiting for you!

1520
02:44:32,963 --> 02:44:34,624
Your pal is dead.

1521
02:44:34,965 --> 02:44:37,900
No...no!

1522
02:45:29,019 --> 02:45:30,953
Learn to bow to the law.

1523
02:45:31,521 --> 02:45:34,752
Taking my arms and
showing your bravery!

1524
02:45:35,025 --> 02:45:36,959
Put away the pistol and
talk if you have the guts!

1525
02:45:38,028 --> 02:45:41,964
Then I'll show you which
law can make Lotiya bow!

1526
02:45:43,033 --> 02:45:49,962
I need neither uniform nor
pistol to teach a thug the law.

1527
02:45:51,041 --> 02:45:54,636
The two arms of the young
men of my country will suffice.

1528
02:47:44,154 --> 02:47:47,555
I know I let you take
the law in your hands.

1529
02:47:48,158 --> 02:47:51,093
It is wrong yet I let you do it.

1530
02:47:51,828 --> 02:47:56,891
Because I felt that was the only
way to drain the acid out of you.

1531
02:47:59,169 --> 02:48:03,037
I feel all the acid simmering
in you has been drained out.

1532
02:48:04,107 --> 02:48:07,042
And once again you've
become the Mahesh...

1533
02:48:07,444 --> 02:48:09,036
..who met me in Nasik.

1534
02:48:09,446 --> 02:48:13,849
I've achieved my aim. I'm
willing to accept any punishment.
