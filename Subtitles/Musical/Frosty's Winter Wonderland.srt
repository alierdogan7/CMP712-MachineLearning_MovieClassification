1
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:06,106
Pass the snow tire.

2
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:27,555
He's not going to come to life.

3
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:30,925
Of course not.
He's not Frosty the Snowman.

4
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:34,066
Only the real Frosty can come to life.

5
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,567
I wish he'd come back
from the North Pole.

6
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:41,575
Yeah, it's not warm here anymore.
He wouldn't melt.

7
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:46,136
He said he'd come back again someday.
I wonder if he really meant it.

8
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,514
Well, certainly he meant it.

9
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,749
You all remember that day Frosty left.

10
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:15,609
I sure do miss all those boys and girls.

11
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:20,475
I've been up here such a long time.

12
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:23,050
I told them I'd be back again someday.

13
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,416
But when will someday come?

14
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,290
"City A Winter Wonderland."

15
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,328
"First Snow Of Season."

16
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,564
Hey, someday is today.

17
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:50,343
<i>So, Frosty sat down
and wrote a letter to all his old friends.</i>

18
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,318
Frosty's coming back!

19
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,554
And when the kids realized
that Frosty was coming back...

20
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,321
it really was a Winter Wonderland.

21
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:10,528
It was wonderful for many reasons.
But most of all...

22
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,894
because Frosty
wasn't going to be lonely anymore.

23
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:18,705
See, he had a very special surprise
in store for him.

24
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,337
You've heard the old familiar tale,
how Frosty came to life.

25
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,742
But do you know the story...

26
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:32,785
of how Frosty took a wife?

27
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,624
You know, when you're a kid...

28
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,828
winter is one of the four best seasons
of the year.

29
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:26,467
But when you're a snowman,
winter is the only season of the year.

30
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:30,604
Watch, here comes one now.

31
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:33,711
With Frosty here,
the sound of winter laughter...

32
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,044
was soon ringing through the meadow.

33
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:41,179
But there was one person
who got very jealous.

34
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:49,394
<i>Jack Frost, that icy artist
who paints the world white every winter.</i>

35
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,731
Why is that snowman
getting all the credit?

36
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,594
Why don't the children love me?

37
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,765
I'm the one who makes winter wonderful.

38
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:09,448
<i>Frosty was still
the fastest belly-whopper in the world.</i>

39
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,519
We're winning.

40
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,955
I'll show him.

41
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:34,196
Hello.

42
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,373
Did you make that neat wind
all by yourself?

43
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:41,503
Why, of course, I did. I'm Jack Frost.

44
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:45,676
I'm wonderful.
Why, I can do anything wintry.

45
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:50,790
Blow winds, freeze ponds,
make blizzards so deep...

46
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:53,986
they'll close down all the schools.

47
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:58,055
Boy, he's just a big bragger.

48
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,657
Yeah. Frosty's lots more fun.

49
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:04,602
- Come on, Frosty, let's go.
- Hop aboard.

50
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:11,504
Yeah, winter's no fun without Frosty.

51
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,472
Frosty. That's all I hear.

52
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,517
A stupid snowman takes my place...

53
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:23,182
just because he has that silly magic hat
that brought him to life.

54
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:27,158
That hat, yes.

55
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,658
I'll eliminate the hat and that will be that.

56
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:40,764
<i>That night, it was so beautiful...</i>

57
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,970
<i>they all went for a sleigh ride
out to the skating park.</i>

58
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,344
But, Frosty, there are two horses.

59
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,217
I could never count.

60
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:02,526
<i>When it came to skating,
Frosty was the tops.</i>

61
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:07,227
- Can you make a figure eight, Frosty?
- I can try.

62
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,286
You're right, Frosty. You can't count.

63
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:34,218
Now, if I could just aim my north wind...

64
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,625
at that magic hat.

65
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,262
Get behind me, quick.

66
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,300
Got it!

67
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:52,141
Frosty's magic silk hat!

68
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,344
It's mine! It's mine!

69
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:01,716
There was so much snow
blowing around...

70
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:06,316
that Jack Frost didn't see
that he had the wrong hat.

71
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,258
Ignore me, will they?

72
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:12,730
Now those children
won't have any winter friends.

73
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:19,996
And wearing a horse's hat, he took off
for other, faraway wintry places.

74
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,270
And as for the kids,
the next day they began to notice...

75
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:27,211
<i>something different
about their friend Frosty.</i>

76
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:34,450
- Suppertime, Frosty. Mom wants us home.
- Yup.

77
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:37,850
- Good night, Frosty. See you tomorrow.
- Yup.

78
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:39,717
What's the matter, Frosty?

79
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,490
"Yup. Yup." Doesn't sound like you.

80
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:46,661
It's just that every night
when you go home and leave me...

81
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,765
I miss you something awful.

82
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:53,606
- Yes, but you can't come indoors with us.
- You'd melt, Frosty.

83
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,104
I know.
But when you're all together inside...

84
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:00,812
and I'm all alone outside...

85
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,716
Poor Frosty.

86
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:08,077
Do you know what you need, Frosty?
A wife.

87
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:12,258
- What's a wife?
- A Mrs. Frosty, you know?

88
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,761
Someone you think is very beautiful,
who thinks you're very handsome...

89
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,298
and will love you back when you love her.

90
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,659
What a great invention.

91
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,671
<i>So the next morning they began to build
a beautiful snow-wife...</i>

92
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:32,703
<i>designed to Frosty's
very own specifications.</i>

93
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,474
Kind of round and plump...

94
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:39,013
with the top of her head
coming just above here.

95
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,415
<i>Everybody put everything together.</i>

96
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:49,062
<i>They were ready for the finishing touches.</i>

97
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:50,992
There.

98
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:55,426
<i>Her eyes were two beautiful blue beads...</i>

99
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,334
<i>from Elsie's favorite necklace.</i>

100
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:01,766
<i>They were just plastic,
but they sparkled like sapphires.</i>

101
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,874
<i>Her cute little nose was a thimble.</i>

102
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,509
<i>And her mouth was made
from some of Mom's pink yarn.</i>

103
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:13,416
<i>And an old dust mop became a coiffure.
That's a hairdo, you know.</i>

104
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:18,419
She's beautiful. What's her name?

105
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:21,422
- Cleopatra?
- Nah.

106
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:24,063
- Emantrude?
- Nah.

107
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,565
- Minnehaha?
- Nah.

108
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,192
Cornflakes?

109
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,470
Cornflakes?

110
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,032
How about... Crystal?

111
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,168
Yeah!

112
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,303
- Crystal.
- That's great.

113
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,784
Hello, Crystal.

114
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:54,983
Only one thing.

115
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,890
She's not all living like I am.

116
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:03,366
Not that it's important, but it's important.

117
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,838
- Maybe a hat would bring her to life.
- A lady's hat.

118
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,609
Yap says we can use hers.

119
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:18,473
There must have been some magic
in that pretty hat they found...

120
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:26,783
Nothing.

121
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,798
It was a nice idea anyway.

122
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:42,635
Yeah, things were pretty sad for Frosty.

123
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:47,011
And to make matters worse,
miles and miles away...

124
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:52,018
<i>in another part of winter,
Jack Frost sat down to rest for a minute...</i>

125
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:55,782
<i>and for the first time
he got a good look at that hat.</i>

126
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:04,223
This isn't the magic hat.
This is a horse's hat.

127
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:09,425
Somebody's been horsing around
with Jack Frost.

128
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,397
Now, who did it? It's him.

129
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,998
That frosted snowman did it.

130
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,970
I'll show them, though,
that nobody makes a fool of Jack Frost.

131
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:23,976
When I get through...

132
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:29,011
there'll be no more Frosty the Snowman.

133
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:40,796
<i>Poor Frosty,
he didn't know about Jack Frost's plans.</i>

134
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:44,132
<i>And even if he had known,
he wouldn't have cared...</i>

135
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:48,269
<i>for all his thoughts were about
his beloved, still silent, Crystal.</i>

136
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,744
Crystal, I don't care if you're not all living.

137
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,074
<i>Frosty reached down...</i>

138
00:11:56,182 --> 00:12:00,119
<i>and brought up
a lovely bouquet of frost flowers...</i>

139
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,347
<i>which he had made from the snow.</i>

140
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:08,927
<i>And suddenly,
as the wintry stars twinkled down...</i>

141
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,454
<i>Frosty's gift of love...</i>

142
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:16,498
<i>those simple flowers,
worked an icy miracle.</i>

143
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:21,032
Happy birthday.

144
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:25,544
Crystal, I've been waiting all day.

145
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:29,337
- What kept you?
- Frosty.

146
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:33,279
I thought you'd never think
of those flowers.

147
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:39,252
<i>There never were
two happier snow-people.</i>

148
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,797
Hey, everybody.
We're gonna have a wedding.

149
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,852
<i>Oh, no.</i>

150
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:21,363
Oh, Frosty. What's he done to you?

151
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,534
No more Frosty.

152
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,308
No more Frosty?

153
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:39,010
That's ridiculous. You have a wife...

154
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:43,044
except for the formalities, that is,
to help you now.

155
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,419
There.

156
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:49,490
Everyone knows the groom
should have a flower in his buttonhole.

157
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:54,333
That's just to say, "I love you, Frosty."

158
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,235
Happy birthday.

159
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,267
What?

160
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:03,269
That's impossible. Isn't it?

161
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,311
Wait. Come back here.

162
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,817
You darn snowpersons!

163
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:22,561
Drat. I've been outfrosted again.

164
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,168
Hey, everybody, it's time for that wedding.

165
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:39,367
- A wedding.
- We're gonna need a preacher. Come on.

166
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,115
<i>They were going to hold the wedding
that very night.</i>

167
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:54,256
<i>Finally Parson Brown showed up,
but when he saw Frosty and Crystal...</i>

168
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:55,789
Dear me.

169
00:14:55,862 --> 00:15:00,424
I didn't know you were snowpersons.
I'm only allowed to marry real persons.

170
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:03,525
It just wouldn't be legal if I tied this knot.

171
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,765
- Doggone.
- Oh, dear.

172
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,304
Seems to me that the right parson...

173
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:15,905
to marry a snowman to a snowwoman
would be a snow-parson.

174
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,975
I'll help you build him.

175
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,814
<i>And so they all pitched in.</i>

176
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,348
<i>One, two, three.</i>

177
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,486
<i>There was the nicest snow-parson
you ever did see.</i>

178
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:32,164
<i>And then to make him all living...</i>

179
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:36,030
A parson's not a parson,
till he holds the Good Book in his hand.

180
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,840
- Happy birthday.
- Hooray.

181
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:45,408
A wedding.

182
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,274
Now the competition will be double.

183
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,349
No. I won't allow it.

184
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:58,414
I will not allow it.
I am the most powerful thing in winter.

185
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,959
There's cold wind nipping at my nose.

186
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,226
You must be him.

187
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,064
Jack Frost.

188
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,665
Finally I'm getting some attention.

189
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:16,138
Attention?

190
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:19,873
Why, you're the most
important person here.

191
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:24,179
- We couldn't even begin without you.
- What?

192
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,376
It was so good of you
to come to our wedding.

193
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,922
It's about to start, you know.

194
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:33,824
What are you talking about?

195
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:39,555
If you'd turn that wind down a bit,
it would be a lot easier to be heard.

196
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:43,029
All right, but just for a minute.

197
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,105
What a neat idea.

198
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,443
- What are you whispering about?
- Tell him.

199
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,310
The bride's made of winter...

200
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,817
and the groom's made of winter...

201
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,586
and the parson's made of winter...

202
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:05,147
the whole wedding party should be wintry.

203
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,658
And so...

204
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,862
Would you be the best man?

205
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:11,822
What? Me?

206
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,290
Best man. Could you?

207
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,933
What do you mean, could I?

208
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:22,406
- I've always been the best man.
- Thank you, little friend.

209
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:27,438
- Friend?
- You've made us very happy.

210
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,616
Hey, everybody!

211
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:34,411
Happy birthday.

212
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:40,625
And so the wedding commenced.

213
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:45,692
<i>Over the ground lies a mantle of white.</i>

214
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:50,230
<i>A heaven of diamonds shine down
through the night.</i>

215
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:14,481
I now pronounce you snowman and wife.

216
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,621
And they lived happily ever after.

217
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,559
Through January, February...

218
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,655
March, and way into April.

219
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:30,032
This was the year
winter almost didn't end.

220
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:37,034
When the thermometer gets all reddish,
it's time for us to go.

221
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,442
Wait, friends. I can fix that.

222
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,709
Winter never has to end.

223
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:51,421
With me around,
this fun can go on forever.

224
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:58,660
<i>And it did. It went on and on,
till some folks started to get worried.</i>

225
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,759
<i>It was up to Parson Brown
to set those winter friends straight.</i>

226
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,060
Winter never end?

227
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:09,665
That might be fun for you,
but what about all the trees...

228
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:13,804
with new green leaves inside them
just busting to be born?

229
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,877
And what about the seeds
and the bulbs deep in the ground?

230
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:22,854
Nature made them a promise,
that someday they'd be pretty flowers.

231
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:26,054
Can you imagine how you'd feel...

232
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,060
if someone broke such a promise to you?

233
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:34,198
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.
I like the flowers...

234
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:37,531
even though
I never get a chance to see them.

235
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:41,836
He's right, Frosty. Parson Brown is right.

236
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,308
It's time for us to go.

237
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,742
We'll miss you all so much.

238
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:50,844
We'll be back, you'll see.

239
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,376
Now, come on. No time for long faces.

240
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:39,362
Stop.

241
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,057
It's you again.

242
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:45,799
The talking snowman.

243
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,798
You don't surprise me anymore.

244
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:52,543
Good, and I'd like you to meet Crystal.

245
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,979
Hello. I'm Frosty's snow-wife.

246
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,016
And it is my pleasure, Crystal.

247
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:03,187
Now, isn't that nice? A snow-wife.

248
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,080
A snow-wife!

249
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:22,841
Bye.

250
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:32,879
<i>And when Jack Frost also left
for the North Pole...</i>

251
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:37,785
<i>the gentle warmth of springtime
erased his magic work for another year.</i>

252
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:42,658
<i>And soon the Winter Wonderland
was only a memory.</i>

253
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:47,063
But it was a good memory,
and good memories can never die.

254
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:51,770
Because we all know
that on one not-so-far-away day...

255
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:54,602
that first snowflake will fall.

256
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:58,835
Then...

257
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,450
May all your winters be wonderful.

258
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,984
And frosty, too.
