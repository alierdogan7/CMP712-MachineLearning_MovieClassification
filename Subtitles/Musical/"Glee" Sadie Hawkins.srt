1
00:00:00,177 --> 00:00:01,677
<i>So here's what you missed on</i> Glee:

2
00:00:01,712 --> 00:00:03,738
<i>The New Directions! lost</i>
<i>to the Warblers at Sectionals</i>

3
00:00:03,764 --> 00:00:05,464
<i>when Marley collapsed</i>
<i>in the middle of the show...</i>

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,091
The New Directions!
are finished.

5
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:08,125
<i>...so Sue</i>
<i>took over the choir room,</i>

6
00:00:08,159 --> 00:00:09,293
<i>and now the Glee Club's homeless.</i>

7
00:00:09,327 --> 00:00:11,662
<i>Puck went back to Lima</i>
<i>after striking out in L.A.,</i>

8
00:00:11,696 --> 00:00:13,297
<i>and he and Jake used</i>
<i>to just be half-brothers,</i>

9
00:00:13,331 --> 00:00:14,832
<i>but now they're, like, bros.</i>

10
00:00:14,866 --> 00:00:16,500
<i>Jake and Marley are almost an item,</i>

11
00:00:16,534 --> 00:00:18,102
<i>and Kurt got a surprise</i>
<i>audition to NYADA,</i>

12
00:00:18,136 --> 00:00:19,670
<i>and he totally got in.</i>

13
00:00:19,704 --> 00:00:21,835
<i>That's what you missed on</i> Glee.

14
00:00:25,049 --> 00:00:26,783
(bell rings) I'm telling you,
it's been keeping me up at night.

15
00:00:26,817 --> 00:00:28,818
<i>Something weird's going on</i>
<i>with the Warblers.</i>

16
00:00:28,852 --> 00:00:30,653
They're doing all those weird
flips and superhuman jumps

17
00:00:30,688 --> 00:00:32,188
at Sectionals.
Exactly, that's why they won.

18
00:00:32,222 --> 00:00:33,523
And where was Roundfaced Warbler?

19
00:00:33,557 --> 00:00:35,224
You said he was there
when you went back to Dalton,

20
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:36,559
but come Sectionals, poof, he's gone.

21
00:00:36,594 --> 00:00:37,560
So, what are you saying?

22
00:00:37,595 --> 00:00:38,828
I think they cheated at Sectionals.

23
00:00:38,862 --> 00:00:40,496
Sam, you can't make
accusations like that

24
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:41,564
without any kind of evidence.

25
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:44,000
Well, then, I'll find some evidence.

26
00:00:44,034 --> 00:00:46,336
Do you have any lip balm I can use?

27
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,681
What?

28
00:00:47,716 --> 00:00:50,551
Conspiracy theories make my lips
get all chapped.

29
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:52,153
Come on dude, it's not weird.
We're like brothers.

30
00:00:52,187 --> 00:00:54,422
Yeah, um, sure.

31
00:00:54,456 --> 00:00:56,691
Here you go.
Thank you.

32
00:00:56,725 --> 00:00:58,526
Mmm.

33
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,593
Guys?

34
00:00:59,628 --> 00:01:01,362
You're late.
I know.

35
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:03,030
It's not...

36
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:05,499
This meeting of the
McKinley High Student Council

37
00:01:05,534 --> 00:01:06,667
is now in session.

38
00:01:06,702 --> 00:01:07,668
First order of business:

39
00:01:07,703 --> 00:01:08,936
Secretary Cohen-Chang,

40
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:10,371
will you please read the minutes
from last meeting?

41
00:01:10,405 --> 00:01:12,773
Sam did a Daniel Craig
impression for 45 minutes.

42
00:01:12,808 --> 00:01:14,608
(à la James Bond): I'll have
it shaken and stirred, too.

43
00:01:14,643 --> 00:01:15,710
BLAINE:
That was fantastic.

44
00:01:15,744 --> 00:01:17,712
Thank you,
Secretary Cohen-Chang.

45
00:01:17,746 --> 00:01:19,447
Treasurer Motta, uh,
if we could go through

46
00:01:19,481 --> 00:01:21,882
the budget appropriations
we were talking about last...

47
00:01:21,917 --> 00:01:23,117
Yes, Tina?

48
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:26,120
It is now officially
142 days until Prom,

49
00:01:26,154 --> 00:01:28,055
where all the hot girls
get immediately snatched up

50
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,223
by all the hot guys,

51
00:01:29,257 --> 00:01:30,224
then the sort of hot girls

52
00:01:30,258 --> 00:01:31,892
get asked out by the sort of hot guys,

53
00:01:31,927 --> 00:01:34,228
and then all the rest of us
have to sit around and wait

54
00:01:34,262 --> 00:01:37,531
for all the nerds and the freaks
and the burn-outs and the losers

55
00:01:37,566 --> 00:01:39,367
to work up some courage and ask us out

56
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:41,902
to the most awkward night
of heavy petting we're likely

57
00:01:41,937 --> 00:01:43,904
to get till we wake up
in a nursing home

58
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:45,106
getting groped by an orderly.

59
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,407
Okay, well, the record,

60
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:48,242
I think you're totally sort of hot.

61
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:49,777
Like, if I was, like,
in a bunker with you,

62
00:01:49,811 --> 00:01:50,778
I would totally hit that.

63
00:01:50,812 --> 00:01:52,546
Tina, what are you suggesting?

64
00:01:52,581 --> 00:01:54,615
I propose the First Annual

65
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:56,283
McKinley High Sadie Hawkins Dance.

66
00:01:57,352 --> 00:01:58,386
It's what you call a dance

67
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,553
where the girls ask the guys.

68
00:01:59,588 --> 00:02:01,655
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

69
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,723
Why not?

70
00:02:02,758 --> 00:02:03,891
It was the topic of discussion

71
00:02:03,925 --> 00:02:05,059
at the last meeting of the.

72
00:02:05,093 --> 00:02:06,260
"Too Young to Be Bitter Club."

73
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:09,096
(sighs) Ever since I dated Puckerman,

74
00:02:09,131 --> 00:02:10,798
no one will ask me to a dance.

75
00:02:10,832 --> 00:02:12,733
I think everyone assumes
you have herpes.

76
00:02:12,768 --> 00:02:15,302
No one asks me to dances
'cause I have such clammy hands.

77
00:02:15,337 --> 00:02:17,238
I'm a hot piece of ass

78
00:02:17,272 --> 00:02:18,806
and I want to shake

79
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,341
this sweet thing on a dance floor.

80
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,209
Ba-bam.

81
00:02:26,014 --> 00:02:28,649
Becky is right, if I understood
what she said correctly.

82
00:02:28,683 --> 00:02:31,285
Why are the guys so empowered
to ask us to a dance

83
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,953
when we just have to sit around
and wait?

84
00:02:32,988 --> 00:02:36,590
Wouldn't it be great
if we got to choose?

85
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,426
All in favor of a dance
where the girls ask the guys...

86
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,827
BLAINE:
W-Wait...

87
00:02:39,861 --> 00:02:40,961
wait, wait a second.
Hold on just one...

88
00:02:40,996 --> 00:02:41,996
It's official.

89
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,464
Get ready for the first annual

90
00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:45,299
McKinley High Sadie Hawkins Dance.

91
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,134
(light applause, whoops)

<i>My first week at NYADA,</i>

94
00:02:54,142 --> 00:02:56,110
<i>and the most surprising thing</i>
<i>about college</i>

95
00:02:56,144 --> 00:02:58,546
<i>is it's just like high school.</i>

96
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,947
<i>It's all about the cliques.</i>

97
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:01,348
<i>The stage combat majors are the jocks.</i>

98
00:03:01,383 --> 00:03:03,484
<i>Classical acting majors are the preps.</i>

99
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:05,219
<i>The ballerinas are the mean girls,</i>

100
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:06,987
<i>and if they're at the top</i>
<i>of the social pyramid,</i>

101
00:03:07,022 --> 00:03:08,823
<i>then, once again,</i>

102
00:03:08,857 --> 00:03:11,392
<i>I'm at the bottom.</i>

103
00:03:11,426 --> 00:03:12,993
<i>I assumed Rachel and I</i>
<i>would be as inseparable</i>

104
00:03:13,028 --> 00:03:14,662
<i>as the twins in</i> Side Show,

105
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:16,063
<i>but she's always rushing off</i>
<i>to help Brody</i>

106
00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:17,898
<i>with something that</i>
<i>requires him to be shirtless.</i>

107
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:20,167
RACHEL: All right, Brody has an
audition for <i>Magic Mike: The Musical,</i>

108
00:03:20,202 --> 00:03:21,702
so I'm gonna go help him.
I'll see you at home later.

109
00:03:21,736 --> 00:03:23,070
And I love you. Mwah.

KURT:
<i>The truth is this guy needs</i>

111
00:03:24,906 --> 00:03:26,173
<i>to start making new friends,</i>

112
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,741
<i>and just like in high school,</i>

113
00:03:27,776 --> 00:03:30,311
<i>the best way to do that</i>
<i>is extracurriculars.</i>

114
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:33,214
<i>Let's see, the Elizabethan Society,</i>

115
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,882
<i>the Grand Guignol Club,</i>

116
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:38,486
<i>the Tennessee Williams</i>
<i>Play Reading Group, and...</i>

117
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,920
What's Adam's Apples?

118
00:03:39,955 --> 00:03:41,188
NYADA's show choir;
You should join.

119
00:03:41,223 --> 00:03:43,057
It's super fun.

120
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:45,092
(school bell ringing)

121
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:53,501
I feel totally powerless.

122
00:03:53,535 --> 00:03:56,170
JAKE: Okay, any second any girl
could just come up and ask us

123
00:03:56,204 --> 00:03:59,273
to the dance, and it will
be very hard to say no.

124
00:03:59,307 --> 00:04:01,008
Or worse, no one asks us at all.

125
00:04:01,042 --> 00:04:03,077
This must be what the girls
feel like all the time.

126
00:04:03,111 --> 00:04:04,445
It is.

127
00:04:07,048 --> 00:04:09,416
(school bell ringing)

128
00:04:09,451 --> 00:04:11,752
(groans) Whoo!

129
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:13,888
Hey, Finn, want to arm wrestle?

130
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:15,289
It'll really get your blood flowing.

131
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:16,757
Not today, Coach.

132
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,959
Anyone?

133
00:04:18,994 --> 00:04:21,629
Hey, pumpkin, I heard about Sue
taking over your choir room.

134
00:04:21,663 --> 00:04:23,531
I'm really sorry about that.

135
00:04:23,565 --> 00:04:25,900
Yeah, yeah, it's been pretty rough.

136
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:27,568
I feel like we're the Fugees
or something,

137
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:29,436
just bouncing around
from available classroom

138
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:30,604
to available classroom.

139
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,873
You... wait, you mean
like refugees?

140
00:04:32,908 --> 00:04:34,975
Yeah. I mean, it's great we're
still together as a group,

141
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,978
but without competitions,
I have to come up

142
00:04:38,013 --> 00:04:39,947
with something fun and
interesting on a weekly basis

143
00:04:39,981 --> 00:04:41,749
just to keep everybody involved,

144
00:04:41,783 --> 00:04:43,751
and this week I'm just stuck.
It's a no-brainer.

145
00:04:43,785 --> 00:04:45,486
The Sadie Hawkins Dance.

146
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,454
Well, no offense, but how
am I supposed to make a lesson

147
00:04:47,489 --> 00:04:48,789
out of a dumb school dance?

148
00:04:48,823 --> 00:04:49,924
When I was in high school,

149
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,091
girls like me didn't get asked out.

150
00:04:51,126 --> 00:04:52,426
So the only dance I could go to

151
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,561
was Sadie Hawkins.

152
00:04:53,595 --> 00:04:55,563
I asked the preacher's son.

153
00:04:55,597 --> 00:04:57,998
He was stoned the whole time,
but we had a ball.

154
00:04:58,033 --> 00:04:59,567
Going to that dance gave me the courage

155
00:04:59,601 --> 00:05:01,835
and the confidence
to join the football team.

156
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,238
I was the first girl
in Missouri to ever do it.

157
00:05:04,272 --> 00:05:06,273
Sadie Hawkins

158
00:05:06,308 --> 00:05:07,975
is a metaphor for empowerment,

159
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:09,076
and not just for women,

160
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,611
but for everyone

161
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:12,980
who is sick and tired
of the status quo.

162
00:05:15,684 --> 00:05:17,284
(Finn sighs)

163
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,686
I want to sit under Venus.

164
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,154
I want to sit under Uranus.

165
00:05:20,188 --> 00:05:22,223
(laughter) What's so funny?

166
00:05:24,226 --> 00:05:26,360
So this week in Glee Club,
it's ladies' choice,

167
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:27,928
inspired by the Sadie Hawkins Dance.

168
00:05:27,963 --> 00:05:29,196
Which I thought of.

169
00:05:29,231 --> 00:05:30,264
It was my idea.

170
00:05:30,298 --> 00:05:31,465
Yes, thank you, Tina.

171
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:33,934
And every girl will sing to whoever

172
00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:35,169
they want to take to the dance.

173
00:05:35,203 --> 00:05:37,871
KITTY: Well, I, for one,
love this lesson.

174
00:05:37,906 --> 00:05:39,840
I've got a song I want
to sing to somebody.

RACHEL (whispering):
Kurt, he's still sleeping.

178
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,617
♪ Would you like some tea? ♪

179
00:05:49,651 --> 00:05:51,552
Yes, I would, but shh.

180
00:05:51,586 --> 00:05:52,886
Yes.
Brody's here?

181
00:05:52,921 --> 00:05:54,188
Did he spend the night?

182
00:05:54,222 --> 00:05:56,557
Yeah. We had dinner
last night at Balthazar,

183
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:58,392
and he insisted on taking me home.

184
00:05:58,426 --> 00:06:01,128
Rachel. You know, the train ride
back to Manhattan's really long,

185
00:06:01,162 --> 00:06:03,030
so I just invited him to stay over.

186
00:06:03,064 --> 00:06:06,400
Oh, Rachel Berry, I am scandalized.

187
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:07,801
Well, I just...
I seized the moment.

188
00:06:07,836 --> 00:06:09,503
I really, I like him,

189
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:11,071
and I'm tired of second-guessing
something that feels so right.

190
00:06:11,106 --> 00:06:13,073
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

191
00:06:13,108 --> 00:06:14,375
Well, as long as you're happy

192
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:15,809
and I have a white noise machine,

193
00:06:15,844 --> 00:06:17,244
I guess I'm happy, too.

194
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,079
How are you?
How was your first week?

195
00:06:19,114 --> 00:06:21,248
It was good, you know, a little lonely,

196
00:06:21,283 --> 00:06:22,383
but I was thinking to meet people,

197
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:23,917
I would join the show choir

198
00:06:23,952 --> 00:06:26,520
called the Adam's Apples.
Oh, no, no, no, no. No.

199
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:28,989
Listen to me, there is a very rigid

200
00:06:29,024 --> 00:06:30,724
performing arts hierarchy at NYADA,

201
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:33,761
and show choir is, like,
it's the lowest of the low.

202
00:06:33,795 --> 00:06:35,062
It's beneath stage
managers and carpenters.

203
00:06:35,096 --> 00:06:37,698
That is social and career suicide.

204
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:40,567
But at McKinley...
We're not at McKinley anymore.

205
00:06:40,602 --> 00:06:42,603
And we're done being underdogs;
If you want to join a club,

206
00:06:42,637 --> 00:06:44,505
just do anything but the Adam's Apples.

207
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:46,840
That's what all the
future chorus kids do.

208
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,575
If you do show choir in college,
all right,

209
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,544
you might as well be doomed
to a life of playing

210
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:51,912
a dancing teapot at Disneyland.

211
00:06:54,716 --> 00:06:58,085
(school bell ringing) All right, so
Tina is ready to present her solo

212
00:06:58,119 --> 00:07:00,688
and make her choice.

213
00:07:00,722 --> 00:07:02,222
Gentlemen, prepare yourselves

214
00:07:02,257 --> 00:07:03,390
for Tina Cohen-Chang.

215
00:07:03,425 --> 00:07:05,125
(applause)

216
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,261
Whoo! Whoo!

217
00:07:07,295 --> 00:07:08,362
Thank you, Finn.

218
00:07:08,396 --> 00:07:09,697
For my song, I'll be performing.

219
00:07:09,731 --> 00:07:11,098
"I Don't Know How to Love Him"

220
00:07:11,132 --> 00:07:12,733
from <i>Jesus Christ Superstar.</i>

221
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:15,269
It's about the pain
of unrequited love and...

222
00:07:15,303 --> 00:07:16,537
Yeah, okay, just wrap it up.

223
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:18,105
Beiste needs the locker room
at 4:30.

224
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:19,773
Sorry. Hit it.

225
00:07:19,808 --> 00:07:21,775
Who do you think she's asking?

226
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,410
The only obvious choice in the room.

227
00:07:23,445 --> 00:07:25,145
A charming debonair
figure from her past.

228
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,247
A forbidden love she let
slip through her fingers.

229
00:07:27,282 --> 00:07:29,583
Unique?

230
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:31,251

Tina!

266
00:09:44,219 --> 00:09:46,687
So... Blaine,

267
00:09:46,721 --> 00:09:49,423
will you go to the dance with me?

268
00:09:54,963 --> 00:09:56,530
Oh, uh...

269
00:09:56,564 --> 00:09:57,865
(chuckles)

270
00:09:57,899 --> 00:09:59,466
Wow, um,

271
00:09:59,501 --> 00:10:01,068
Tina...

272
00:10:01,102 --> 00:10:03,770
I don't know what to say.

273
00:10:03,805 --> 00:10:06,273
Um...

274
00:10:06,307 --> 00:10:08,408
no.

275
00:10:08,443 --> 00:10:11,311
Thank you,

276

00:10:31,266 --> 00:10:32,766
You're thinking about
signing up, aren't you?

00:10:32,801 --> 00:10:34,868
Oh, uh, maybe.

00:10:34,903 --> 00:10:36,270

00:10:36,304 --> 00:10:39,807
Adam, a senior and founder
and fearless leader

283
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:41,208
of the Adam's Apples, the group you are

284
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:42,309
very seriously considering joining.

285
00:10:42,335 --> 00:10:44,211
I'm Kurt.
Kurt Hummel.

286
00:10:44,237 --> 00:10:45,371
Your Winter Showcase performance

287
00:10:45,405 --> 00:10:47,306
was breathtaking.

288
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,474
But now you're here,

289
00:10:48,508 --> 00:10:49,608
and you're wondering where you fit in

290
00:10:49,642 --> 00:10:51,143
and how can college be
so much like high school,

291
00:10:51,177 --> 00:10:52,311
and you want to join my group,

292
00:10:52,345 --> 00:10:53,746
but you're aware it's a step backwards,

293
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,648
and no, I'm not a mind-reader,
I'm just astute, like you.

294
00:10:56,683 --> 00:10:59,051
We need you; we want you.

295
00:10:59,085 --> 00:11:01,320
Well, I'm very impressed
you said all that in one breath,

296
00:11:01,354 --> 00:11:02,788
but I don't think I'll be joining.

297
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,758
Man, a hard sell.

298
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:08,127
I respect that,
but I'm not willing to go down

299
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:09,828

Come hear us sing.

358
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:40,279
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

359
00:13:40,313 --> 00:13:41,580
Yeah.

360
00:13:41,614 --> 00:13:42,915
Uh, my name is Brittany.

361
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:44,583
I know. Okay. I
just wasn't sure.

362
00:13:44,617 --> 00:13:46,151
We've never actually had
a conversation before,

363
00:13:46,186 --> 00:13:47,786
and this is exciting.

364
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,055
(both chuckling) I noticed

365
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:52,591
that whenever you look at Jake,
you get a really sad look

366
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,928
on your face, and if it's quiet
enough, I can actually hear

367
00:13:55,962 --> 00:13:58,263
that you're whimpering
like a suckling puppy.

368
00:13:58,298 --> 00:14:00,265
I think you want to ask him to
the dance and you're afraid to.

369
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,634
We went out on a couple dates,
and it was really, really nice.

370
00:14:02,669 --> 00:14:04,436
This is my locker.
Oh.

371
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,104
But then, after I
fainted at Sectionals,

372
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:08,840
he started acting really strange.

373
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:09,975
He stopped calling me

374
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:12,744
and he's acting all mysterious.

375
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:13,812
So can I make a suggestion then?

376
00:14:13,846 --> 00:14:14,980
You need to find your power

377
00:14:15,014 --> 00:14:16,315
and I'm gonna help you do that.

378
00:14:16,349 --> 00:14:17,649
How?

379
00:14:17,684 --> 00:14:19,585
Where are you going?

380
00:14:19,619 --> 00:14:21,153
We're gonna sing a song together,

381
00:14:21,187 --> 00:14:22,454
and the music usually starts

382
00:14:22,488 --> 00:14:24,122
when I say something like,

383
00:14:24,157 --> 00:14:26,825
"It's Brittany, bitch,"
or I do one of my magical turns.

00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:29,981
I mean, I mean...

429
00:16:31,284 --> 00:16:33,919
...Jake, would you like to go

430
00:16:33,953 --> 00:16:37,089
to the Sadie Hawkins Dance with me?

431
00:16:37,123 --> 00:16:37,956
Yes.

432
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,157
Yes, I would.

433
00:16:42,028 --> 00:16:43,762
FINN:
Okay, uh, anyone else?

434
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:45,630
BRITTANY:
Sam,

435
00:16:45,665 --> 00:16:48,500
Mm-hmm? Will you go to
Sadie Hawkins with me?

436
00:16:48,534 --> 00:16:50,102
(as Yoda):
Honor it would be.

437
00:16:50,136 --> 00:16:51,770
(laughs) Thank you.

438
00:16:54,107 --> 00:16:55,173
(knocking on window)

439
00:16:59,011 --> 00:17:01,146
(bell ringing)

440
00:17:04,317 --> 00:17:06,118
Okay, I'm gonna get right to it.

441
00:17:06,152 --> 00:17:09,488
Dump the bulimic loser and go to
the Sadie Hawkins Dance with me.

442
00:17:09,522 --> 00:17:10,655
What are you talking about?

443
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,357
I thought you and Marley
were friends now.

444
00:17:12,392 --> 00:17:15,827
Duh, we are. I'm still gonna
gaslight her every chance I get.

445
00:17:15,862 --> 00:17:17,496
Look, I realize Marley's super sweet,

446
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,030
and I'm sure you have
great conversations

447
00:17:19,065 --> 00:17:20,699
when you share milkshakes
down at the drive-in

448
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:21,700
about how you both

449
00:17:21,734 --> 00:17:23,034
love President Eisenhower.

450
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:25,637
But good luck getting past
first base with that girl.

451
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:29,608
I, on the other hand,
could offer you a little...

452
00:17:29,642 --> 00:17:32,611
bit... more.

453
00:17:32,645 --> 00:17:36,114
Oh, really? I thought you were
the good Christian <i>virgin</i> type.

454
00:17:36,149 --> 00:17:37,182
I was.

455
00:17:37,216 --> 00:17:39,151
But I've had a change of heart.

456
00:17:39,185 --> 00:17:42,454
Decided to play by my own rules.

457
00:17:42,488 --> 00:17:44,656
(sighs) You have needs.

458
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:48,393
(whispers): Are you really sure
Marley's <i>up</i> for the job?

459
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:57,502
(bell ringing)

460
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:02,340
I owe you an apology.

461
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:07,345
I... also think you sort of
owe me an apology because...

462
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,681
that was maybe
the most humiliating moment

463
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:13,285
I've experienced in Glee Club,
and that's saying something.

464
00:18:14,387 --> 00:18:15,654
But still...

465
00:18:15,688 --> 00:18:17,255
I'm sorry.

466
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,591
I forgot that story you told
about your old school.

467
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,760
How the whole reason you
transferred to Dalton

468
00:18:21,794 --> 00:18:24,095
was because you got bullied
at a Sadie Hawkins Dance.

469
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,198
No wonder you don't want to go.

470
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:29,234
I apologize.
Thank you, Tina,

471
00:18:29,268 --> 00:18:33,438
but that's not why I can't
go to the dance with you.

472
00:18:33,473 --> 00:18:35,440
Then what is the reason?

473
00:18:35,475 --> 00:18:37,409
I-I can't tell you that.

474
00:18:37,443 --> 00:18:38,543
It-s-it's really
embarrassing.

475
00:18:38,578 --> 00:18:40,445
I swear to God I-I
won't tell anyone.

476
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,347
I have a crush on somebody,

477
00:18:42,381 --> 00:18:44,349
and I don't want to go
to a dance where everyone's

478
00:18:44,383 --> 00:18:45,450
gonna be romantic there but me.

479
00:18:45,485 --> 00:18:46,284
Who?

480
00:18:48,321 --> 00:18:49,454
Who is it?
It's-it's a guy

481
00:18:49,489 --> 00:18:50,889
and he's straight and he doesn't know

482
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:52,123
that I like him.

483
00:18:52,158 --> 00:18:53,458
I swear to God I won't tell anyone.

484
00:18:53,493 --> 00:18:56,027
I'm not some predatory gay,
so... nothing's

485
00:18:56,062 --> 00:18:57,796
gonna happen.
Who is it?

486
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,197
Tell me, Blaine. Y-You can

487
00:18:59,232 --> 00:19:01,132
trust me.
(sighs)

488
00:19:03,135 --> 00:19:04,836
(sighs) It's Sam.

489
00:19:06,739 --> 00:19:07,806
SAM:
Dude.

490
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,474
Look at this.

491
00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:11,409
This is Hunter Clarington
two years ago.

492
00:19:11,444 --> 00:19:13,411
Look how skinny his head is.
Okay, this is him now.

493
00:19:13,446 --> 00:19:14,880
Look how much thicker his head is!

494
00:19:14,914 --> 00:19:16,448
So maybe he started working out.

495
00:19:16,482 --> 00:19:17,883
What, doing
skull-widening exercises?

496
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:19,784
Dude, human growth hormone! HGH!

497
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:20,986
Same thing happened to Mark McGwire

498
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,053
(distant, echoing):
And Kirstie Alley

499
00:19:22,088 --> 00:19:24,456
and Drew Carey and Star Jones

500
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,458
and Aretha Franklin,
Cedric the Entertainer...

501
00:19:26,492 --> 00:19:27,859
It's so stupid.
No.

502
00:19:28,928 --> 00:19:31,596
It's not stupid.

503
00:19:31,631 --> 00:19:33,265
I know what it's like
to have a crush on someone

504
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:35,300
who's never gonna love you back.

505
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,071
I know it's all just a fantasy.

506
00:19:40,106 --> 00:19:41,907
I-I mean...
I'm proud of our relationship.

507
00:19:41,941 --> 00:19:44,843
I'm proud the gay guy can be
friends with the straight guy.

508
00:19:44,877 --> 00:19:47,412
I'm proud of showing
the school that. I just...

509
00:19:47,446 --> 00:19:50,482
I don't want to jeopardize our
friendship, you know? Blaine...

510
00:19:50,516 --> 00:19:51,983
you miss Kurt.

511
00:19:52,018 --> 00:19:54,252
You need someplace to
put your love, right?

512
00:19:54,287 --> 00:19:55,520
I guess.

513
00:19:56,522 --> 00:19:58,990
And then there are those lips...

514
00:19:59,025 --> 00:20:00,792
Those lips. Yes, those lips.

515
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:02,193
And when he does all those impressions?

516
00:20:02,228 --> 00:20:04,629
It's pure crushable crack.

517
00:20:04,664 --> 00:20:05,915
(deep, resonant voice):
Hello, soul sister.

518
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,165
Isn't that Mr. Mister on the radio?

519
00:20:07,199 --> 00:20:09,100
Stereo? The way you look
ain't fair, you know.

520
00:20:09,135 --> 00:20:11,136
(laughter)

521
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:16,207
Okay... here's what we're gonna
do about your very human

522
00:20:16,242 --> 00:20:17,776
and moving dilemma.

523
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,978
We are going to the Sadie
Hawkins Dance together.

524
00:20:21,547 --> 00:20:23,048
We'll go as best friends,

525
00:20:23,082 --> 00:20:25,183
and we're gonna have
the most fun night ever.

526
00:20:25,217 --> 00:20:26,184
Okay?

527
00:20:26,218 --> 00:20:28,219
Come on.

528
00:20:29,221 --> 00:20:30,622
(grunts)

529
00:20:30,656 --> 00:20:31,823
Okay.

530
00:20:36,573 --> 00:20:37,973
I mean, I don't know what to do.

531
00:20:38,008 --> 00:20:39,708
Marley is such a great girl

532
00:20:39,743 --> 00:20:41,844
and I really do want to be a
good guy, but it's, like...

533
00:20:41,878 --> 00:20:43,412
Okay. Let me stop you
right there.

534
00:20:43,446 --> 00:20:44,747
Young guys like you

535
00:20:44,781 --> 00:20:46,749
think you have to hit
a home run every time.

536
00:20:46,783 --> 00:20:48,417
But as long as you're getting on base,

537
00:20:48,451 --> 00:20:50,252
you're always in position to score.

538
00:20:50,287 --> 00:20:52,521
No, you don't understand.
I'm not even getting on base.

539
00:20:52,556 --> 00:20:53,722
And all of a sudden.

540
00:20:53,757 --> 00:20:55,057
Kitty's inviting me
to the Home Run Derby.

541
00:20:55,091 --> 00:20:56,892
Look at me.
I'm your hitting coach,

542
00:20:56,927 --> 00:20:58,227
and I'm waving you off.

543
00:20:58,261 --> 00:21:00,229
Seriously?

544
00:21:00,263 --> 00:21:01,931
I mean, it's, like, a sure thing.

545
00:21:01,965 --> 00:21:03,899
Yeah, it's sure to be
some of the best and...

546
00:21:03,934 --> 00:21:06,001
weirdest toe-curling
you'll ever have, but...

547
00:21:06,036 --> 00:21:07,837
it's also sure to ruin your life.

548
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:10,506
I had every flavor
of Cheerio you can imagine.

549
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,874
Original, Honey Nut.

550
00:21:11,908 --> 00:21:13,008
Did it really mean anything?

551
00:21:13,043 --> 00:21:14,343
No.

552
00:21:14,377 --> 00:21:18,013
I mean, you really like
this Marley chick, right?

553
00:21:18,048 --> 00:21:20,015
You got to resist that
Jesus-loving little devil.

554
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,918
Okay, but Kitty is all up on me.

555
00:21:22,953 --> 00:21:24,520
She's not going away.

556
00:21:24,554 --> 00:21:26,589
Don't you worry, little brother
from a different-colored mother.

557
00:21:26,623 --> 00:21:28,591
I'll make her go away.

558
00:21:32,062 --> 00:21:33,729
RACHEL: Okay, so Brody said he's
gonna meet me at the library

559
00:21:33,763 --> 00:21:35,397
to go downtown.
Do you want to come?

560
00:21:35,432 --> 00:21:37,099
No, no, thanks; I don't want
to be a haggy third wheel

561
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:38,534
on your guys's date.
Come on, you won't be.

562
00:21:38,568 --> 00:21:40,102
All right, you know
what I can't wait for?

563
00:21:40,136 --> 00:21:42,438
I can't wait for you to find the
new man of your dreams. Mm.

564
00:21:42,472 --> 00:21:44,440
And then me, you, him,
and Brody can all go

565
00:21:44,474 --> 00:21:46,275
on double-dates together,
and it'll be so much fun.

566
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:48,110
I really feel
like it's gonna happen soon.

567
00:21:48,144 --> 00:21:50,479
Actually, there is someone
that I have my eye on.

568
00:21:50,513 --> 00:21:52,147
Oh, my God. Who?
Is it Raul Esparza?

569
00:21:52,182 --> 00:21:53,449
(laughs) No, I wish. 'Cause
that would be great.

570
00:21:53,483 --> 00:21:55,284
No, he goes to school with us,

571
00:21:55,318 --> 00:21:57,620
but, I don't know, lately things
have been happening, and...

572
00:21:57,654 --> 00:21:59,989
I'm just gonna try
and figure out if he likes me.

573
00:22:00,023 --> 00:22:02,658
ADAM:
<i>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof?</i>

574
00:22:02,692 --> 00:22:05,728
Hi, uh... it's for the Tennessee
Williams Play-Reading Club.

575
00:22:05,762 --> 00:22:07,563
You'd make a fantastic Brick.

576
00:22:07,597 --> 00:22:09,598
Kind of look like a young Paul Newman.

577
00:22:20,377 --> 00:22:23,679
Hey, Kurt. Nice plié. Oh...

578
00:22:23,713 --> 00:22:26,282
Hi, again. Uh, no.

579
00:22:26,316 --> 00:22:28,951
Uh, my ex-boyfriend was
more of the dancer in...

580
00:22:28,985 --> 00:22:30,686
in our relationship.

581
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,588
Let's try this again.

582
00:22:32,622 --> 00:22:34,423
Hey, Kurt.

583
00:22:34,457 --> 00:22:36,125
Nice plié.

584
00:22:38,061 --> 00:22:40,029
Thank you.

585
00:22:40,063 --> 00:22:42,264
You're welcome.

586
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:44,433
Oh, my God, he is
totally crushing on you!

587
00:22:44,467 --> 00:22:45,601
What is his name?

588
00:22:45,635 --> 00:22:47,436
I-I don't want
to jinx it, okay?

589
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:50,673
I mean, he's 22,
sophisticated, handsome.

590
00:22:50,707 --> 00:22:52,308
Great.

591
00:22:52,342 --> 00:22:54,476
Just not what he wants...
to be with me.

592
00:22:54,511 --> 00:22:56,378
Oh, God, Kurt, you are a catch, okay?

593
00:22:56,413 --> 00:22:59,381
And now that, you know, things
with you and Blaine are good,

594
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:01,050
and you're finally over the breakup,

595
00:23:01,084 --> 00:23:02,718
I think it's really time for you

596
00:23:02,752 --> 00:23:04,453
to put yourself out there, you know?

597
00:23:04,487 --> 00:23:06,355
Hey, look, if this guy doesn't want

598
00:23:06,389 --> 00:23:07,890
to ask you out, then you

599
00:23:07,924 --> 00:23:09,558
ask him out, okay?

600
00:23:09,592 --> 00:23:11,560
I promise you, it'll be worth the risk.

601
00:23:11,594 --> 00:23:13,729
There's nothing like being
in love in New York.

602
00:23:13,763 --> 00:23:15,397
Love? Already?

603
00:23:15,432 --> 00:23:16,966
What can I say?
Things move fast here.

604
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,567
It's not like high school.

605
00:23:18,601 --> 00:23:21,403
Says the girl who almost
got married before graduation.

606
00:23:21,438 --> 00:23:23,739
Seize the moment! Do it!

607
00:23:23,773 --> 00:23:25,374
It'll be worth it.

608
00:23:32,115 --> 00:23:33,315
(school bell ringing)

609
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,550
I'm going to keep this simple,

610
00:23:34,584 --> 00:23:36,185
for my sake as much as yours.

611
00:23:36,219 --> 00:23:37,820
Stay away from my little bro.

612
00:23:37,854 --> 00:23:39,722
He's not interested in
your skanky Meow Mix.

613
00:23:39,756 --> 00:23:41,924
Speaking of things that are
past their freshness date,

614
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:44,360
didn't you graduate...
barely?

615
00:23:44,394 --> 00:23:45,894
I recently relocated back to Lima.

616
00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:47,529
I find it to be a less
distracting environment

617
00:23:47,564 --> 00:23:49,231
to focus on my <i>screenwriting.</i>

618
00:23:49,265 --> 00:23:51,233
Don't you have to be able
to spell to be a writer?

619
00:23:51,267 --> 00:23:52,701
I know how to spell.

620
00:23:52,736 --> 00:23:55,037
Leave my brother A-L-O-N.

621
00:23:55,071 --> 00:23:56,905
I understand the Puckerman
musk is impossible

622
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,540
for chicks to resist.
We're like

623
00:23:58,575 --> 00:24:00,376
chocolate chip cookies
right out of the oven.

624
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:02,511
Sure you know we're not
good for you, but one whiff

625
00:24:02,545 --> 00:24:05,014
of our fresh-baked goodness,
and the next thing you know,

626
00:24:05,048 --> 00:24:07,116
you're lying in bed,
covered in crumbs, crying.

627
00:24:10,286 --> 00:24:11,387
Jake is fighting his instincts.

628
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:12,521
He's trying to be a good guy.

629
00:24:12,555 --> 00:24:14,256
If you really like him,

630
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,425
you'll back off and give him
a chance to do the right thing.

631
00:24:16,459 --> 00:24:18,927
I don't like Jake.

632
00:24:18,962 --> 00:24:22,197
I'm a mean, hot, bitch that
likes to get what she wants.

633
00:24:22,232 --> 00:24:24,566
Well, it's not gonna happen.

634
00:24:24,601 --> 00:24:26,068
I'm not going to let it happen,

635
00:24:26,102 --> 00:24:28,537
so all you're going to do is get
rejected and embarrass yourself.

636
00:24:28,571 --> 00:24:29,972
Fair point.

637
00:24:30,006 --> 00:24:33,075
But I certainly can't
go to the dance alone.

638
00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:35,377
Out.

639
00:24:35,412 --> 00:24:38,881
What are you doing Saturday night?

640
00:24:38,915 --> 00:24:40,649
You want to go with me?

641
00:24:40,683 --> 00:24:42,785
It's depressing that
you hang around school,

642
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:44,820
but you're just hot
enough to pull it off.

643
00:24:44,854 --> 00:24:46,555
I assume vintage Puckerman
is just as tasty.

644
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:48,457
It's better, but you can't handle me.

645
00:24:48,491 --> 00:24:50,793
You're used to dealing with amateurs.

646
00:24:50,827 --> 00:24:52,294
I'm professional.

647
00:24:52,328 --> 00:24:53,295
What's the difference?

648
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:55,130
Amateurs have threesomes.

649
00:24:55,165 --> 00:24:56,465
Professionals have foursomes.

650
00:24:56,499 --> 00:24:58,567
I've seen things, done things

651
00:24:58,601 --> 00:25:00,335
that would keep you up at night.

652
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:03,472
You want to keep me away
from your brother?

653
00:25:03,506 --> 00:25:06,175
Give me a big old yarn ball
of muscles to distract me.

654
00:25:06,209 --> 00:25:08,143
Aren't you underage?
I have a fake I.D.

655
00:25:08,178 --> 00:25:09,812
Good enough for me.

656
00:25:09,846 --> 00:25:11,513
It's Sadie Hawkins, so, I assume

657
00:25:11,548 --> 00:25:13,315
that means you're paying
for everything.

658
00:25:13,349 --> 00:25:17,519
And if you want to get all up
in this, I expect to be fed.

659
00:25:17,554 --> 00:25:19,688
I'll pick you up at 7:00. We can
swing by the drive-through.

660
00:25:19,722 --> 00:25:22,825
And my dates are always
underwear-optional.

661
00:25:28,331 --> 00:25:32,534
Tina, these decorations are incredible.

662
00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:34,870
Well, Sadie Hawkins Dances are
sometimes called "Snowballs,"

663
00:25:34,904 --> 00:25:37,606
so that's where I got the
idea for a snowflake theme.

664
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,375
I'm really glad
that you invited me to this.

665
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,311
No Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder

666
00:25:42,345 --> 00:25:43,545
from what happened before?

667
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,114
I thought there might be, but no.

668
00:25:45,148 --> 00:25:46,682
I'm thrilled.

669
00:25:46,716 --> 00:25:48,450
ARTIE:
What's up, McKinley?

670
00:25:48,485 --> 00:25:49,852
(applause and cheering)

671
00:25:49,886 --> 00:25:51,653
We've got quite the set.

672
00:25:51,688 --> 00:25:52,955
We'd like to dedicate

673
00:25:52,989 --> 00:25:55,190
this song to all the strong, proud

674
00:25:55,225 --> 00:25:57,659
and empowered ladies
who stuck their necks out

675
00:25:57,694 --> 00:25:59,027
to make this happen.

676
00:25:59,062 --> 00:26:00,963
This week, you showed us
what it feels like

677
00:26:00,997 --> 00:26:03,031
to wait anxiously
by the phone that never rings.

678
00:26:03,066 --> 00:26:05,701
The horror when all your friends
get asked to the dance,

679
00:26:05,735 --> 00:26:07,503
and you don't,
and you have to sit there...

680
00:26:07,537 --> 00:26:09,238
BLAINE: All right, cool.
Thank you, Artie.

681
00:26:09,272 --> 00:26:11,707
This next one's for all the,
uh, powerful women out there.

682
00:26:11,741 --> 00:26:14,510

killing my Jesus.

881
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:21,091
I was willing to make an exception

882
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,593
because of your biceps,

883
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,394

888

00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,673
I read your screenplay, you know.

892
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:37,841
Why didn't you tell me?

893
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:38,842
I gave it to you, like, three days ago.

894
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:40,043
It took me that long to get through

895
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,044
all the spelling errors.

896
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,412
Have you heard of spell check?

897
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:43,614
No.

898
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:46,049
Anyways, it's actually really good.

899
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,517
You really think so?

900
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,019

904
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:56,193
I like Keanu for the lead.

906
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:00,130
I really think you
could be a screenwriter.

It's not just Hunter.

919
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,457
Half the Warblers have gained
ten pounds of muscle

920
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:28,792
since they joined the team.

921
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:30,127
FINN:
I already looked into this.

922
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:31,428
This is a weight training regimen

923
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,163
that they stole from Vocal Adrenaline.

924
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:34,297
You can't just go from being a twig

00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:35,632

in a few months.

926
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:36,633
Tell him, Sam.

927
00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:37,901
Look, the average male gains

928
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:39,936
up to two pounds of
muscle per month... fact!

929
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,004
And that's without cheating.

930
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:41,905
We looked it up online.

931
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:42,973
Plus, uh...

932
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:43,974
Look at this cell phone video

933
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:45,308
that Artie and Joe Hart took

934
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:46,176
down at the Lima Bean the other day.

935
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,177
What the hell is this?

936
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:48,578
Did you put Splenda in my latte?

937
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:51,348
You're a barista!
You don't think!

938
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:53,183
You need to remember like six things
Here comes the biscotti throw.

939
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:55,786
And one of them is that the
sugar comes in the brown packet

940
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,954
and the Splenda is in the yellow!

941
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,524
I freaking hate Splenda!

942
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:03,193
It tastes like pencils!

943
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,195
Why are you putting pencils

944
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:07,197
in my latte?!

945
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:09,299
Now, <i>that</i> is 'roid rage

946
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,534
and you know it.

947
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:13,437
Look, chapter seven, subsection 16,

948
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:14,404
rule four, line nine.

949
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:16,039
"Any team using
performance-enhancing drugs,"

950
00:36:16,074 --> 00:36:18,041
including amphetamines,
anabolic steroid,

951
00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:20,277
human growth hormone or Four Loko

952
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,612
will be automatically
disqualified from competition.

953
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:23,680
The rule is retroactive,

954
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:25,315
so if we can prove that they used

955
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,217
at Sectionals, they'll have to forfeit

956
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:28,218
and we'll win.

957
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:29,720
Glee Club is back.
Blam!

958
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:32,522
Guys, what you are asking me
to do here is beyond serious.

959
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:34,124
The Warblers are, like,

960
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:35,826
one of the most respected
glee clubs in the country.

961
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,028
To accuse them of this
when-when all we have for proof

962
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:41,998
is photos of some dudes' heads
and a-a cell phone video?

963
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,500
Look, I want Glee Club back

964
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,968
just as much as you guys, but...

965
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:46,903
this isn't enough.

966
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:49,072
We need more real proof.

967
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:51,007
We have some.

968
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,478
Me.

969
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:56,012
I knew when Trent didn't
perform with the Warblers

970
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,013
at Sectionals that something was up.

971
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,548
FINN:
Yeah, he is

972
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:01,351
kind of like the sunshine
of the group, isn't he?

973
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,754
Blaine and I joined
the Warblers together.

974
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,322
It was a band of brothers,

975
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:07,657
a group joined by harmony and honor.

976
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:11,661
And then Blaine left and
Sebastian came, then Hunter...

977
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,330
They just chipped away at everything

978
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,398
that was good and special about us.

979
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:16,566

<i>Winning was everything.</i>

981
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,204
<i>I mean, you took the shots</i>
<i>or you didn't perform.</i>

982
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,406
Next. <i>Singing with the
Warblers is my life,</i>

983
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:25,509

What are you, afraid?

987
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:32,315
I'm not doing this.

988
00:37:32,841 --> 00:37:35,519
I don't even shave yet.

989
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:37,187
The Warblers mean everything to me,

990
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:39,723

to betray them like this.

991
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,424
You're not betraying them.

992
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,460
Hunter betrayed the Warblers,
you're saving them.

993
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:44,795
Yeah, that's what they said
about Brutus.

994
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:46,062
And Cassius.

995
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,597
Look, if I go public with this,

996
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:49,633
then the Warblers' reputation...
it's ruined forever.

997

00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,931
Come on.
But there's no music.

1047
00:39:50,966 --> 00:39:53,534
Well, use your imagination.

1048
00:39:53,568 --> 00:39:55,769
("I Only Have Eyes For You"
intro plays)

1049
00:39:59,808 --> 00:40:01,375

I am awesome.
(Marley laughs)

1054
00:40:14,022 --> 00:40:15,322
I mean, I always knew I was pretty cool

1055
00:40:15,357 --> 00:40:17,091
but tonight is the first night

1056
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,892
I realized how awesome I was.

1057
00:40:18,927 --> 00:40:19,994
Why is that?

1058
00:40:20,028 --> 00:40:21,729
Because you are the most amazing

1059
00:40:21,763 --> 00:40:23,230
person I've ever met.

1060
00:40:23,264 --> 00:40:24,398
And somehow,

1061
00:40:24,432 --> 00:40:26,233
I convinced you to be into me.

1062
00:40:26,267 --> 00:40:28,068
You're incredible.

1063
00:40:28,103 --> 00:40:29,303
I'm done. I don't...

1064
00:40:29,337 --> 00:40:31,638
I don't want to be with anybody else.

1065
00:40:31,673 --> 00:40:33,440

BLAINE:
Tina!

1071
00:40:53,395 --> 00:40:54,528
Excuse me.

1072
00:40:54,562 --> 00:40:56,096
Hey. I thought you split.

1073
00:40:56,131 --> 00:40:58,165
No. No, not at all.

1074
00:40:58,199 --> 00:40:59,867
We were just dealing
with some Glee stuff.

1075
00:40:59,901 --> 00:41:01,368
Anything good?
I'm not sure yet,

1076
00:41:01,403 --> 00:41:03,704
but if it works out, we may
have just saved the Glee Club.

1077
00:41:03,738 --> 00:41:06,040
Is there anything you can't do?

1078
00:41:06,074 --> 00:41:08,342
(chuckles) I know I can't possibly

1079
00:41:08,376 --> 00:41:09,543
leave here without having

1080
00:41:09,577 --> 00:41:11,011

I promise I will never be late again.

1098
00:42:20,315 --> 00:42:22,316
I'll get an apartment out here.

1099
00:42:25,587 --> 00:42:27,754
Why don't you just move in?

1100
00:42:32,393 --> 00:42:34,294
All right, let the record

1101
00:42:34,329 --> 00:42:35,429
state that the ladies of McKinley

1102
00:42:35,463 --> 00:42:36,930
are grateful
to Tina Cohen-Chang.

1103
00:42:36,965 --> 00:42:39,299
That Sadie Hawkins Dance
gave me back my swag.

1104
00:42:39,334 --> 00:42:41,735
I not only snagged the cutest
Christian hippie in all of Ohio,

1105
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:42,936
I was also empowered

1106
00:42:42,971 --> 00:42:44,872
to apply for a wrestling
scholarship at...

1107
00:42:44,906 --> 00:42:45,873
Harvard.

1108
00:42:45,907 --> 00:42:47,107
(all gasping, cheering)

1109
00:42:47,142 --> 00:42:48,742
I think Brett really likes me.

1110
00:42:48,776 --> 00:42:50,277
He even baked me brownies.

1111
00:42:50,311 --> 00:42:51,945
Isn't that sweet?

1112
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,547
I can't stop eating them.

1113
00:42:53,581 --> 00:42:56,250
And I got to third base, bitches!

1114
00:42:56,284 --> 00:42:58,418
(cheering)

1115
00:42:58,453 --> 00:42:59,820
The dance couldn't have
gone more perfectly

1116
00:42:59,854 --> 00:43:02,055
if I do say so myself.

1117
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:03,290
And just between us girls,

1118
00:43:03,324 --> 00:43:04,758
I think I found the love of my life.

1119
00:43:04,792 --> 00:43:07,394
What? You're not talking
about Gay Blaine?

1120
00:43:07,428 --> 00:43:09,296
The "Too Young to Be Bitter
Club" is hereby disbanded.

1121
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:11,665
(cheering, whooping)

1122
00:43:11,699 --> 00:43:12,933
Bring it in, Tina! Bring it in!

1123
00:43:12,967 --> 00:43:15,090
Get over here, Tina.

1124
