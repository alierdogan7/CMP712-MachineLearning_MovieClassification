Hurry up, you little mouse.

713
01:00:27,716 --> 01:00:30,947
You're not washing
fast enough to keep up
with the great Grizelda.

714
01:00:31,036 --> 01:00:34,472
Well, let's see now.
Two and a half cups of milk.

715
01:00:34,796 --> 01:00:37,674
Make the curd separately,
dust with flour...

716
01:00:37,756 --> 01:00:40,190
Ooh, you're such
a lucky boy, Hansel.

[laughing]

718
01:00:43,036 --> 01:00:45,869
I'm making you
a lemon-cream cake.

719
01:00:47,076 --> 01:00:48,828
I don't want
anything from you.

720
01:00:49,276 --> 01:00:50,789
Let me out of here!

721
01:00:53,156 --> 01:00:56,831
Uh, boysenberry, elderberry,

723
01:00:59,076 --> 01:01:01,715
ooh, firm pears,

724
01:01:02,756 --> 01:01:05,987
crystallized ginger
and apple juice.

725
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:09,429
Hansel, a gingered pear pie?

726
01:01:09,516 --> 01:01:13,270
Ooh, I've never made
one of those before.

727
01:01:13,876 --> 01:01:17,505
Or what about my delicious
bread-and-butter pudding

728
01:01:17,596 --> 01:01:18,995
with jam and meringue?

729
01:01:19,076 --> 01:01:21,670
I'll eat no more
of your cooking, witch!

730
01:01:22,276 --> 01:01:25,666
You'll eat what I tell you to,
when I tell you to.

731
01:01:25,756 --> 01:01:28,475
The only time
I'll let your little sister
stop her chores,

732
01:01:28,556 --> 01:01:30,228
is when you're eating.

733
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:31,551
Understand?

734
01:01:32,076 --> 01:01:34,988
We've got to fatten
you up like a pig.

735
01:01:37,996 --> 01:01:40,988
Gretel, wash that pie plate
and be quick about it.

736
01:02:28,396 --> 01:02:31,786
You've still got
a whole barrel
of apples to do.

737
01:02:32,716 --> 01:02:34,707
At that rate
you'll never finish!

738
01:02:39,516 --> 01:02:40,710
Faster.

are you, little Hansel?

742
01:02:57,476 --> 01:02:58,670
Give me your finger.

743
01:03:01,996 --> 01:03:03,395
Oh, my, my.

744
01:03:03,996 --> 01:03:06,794
You still need
some more fattening up

745
01:03:07,196 --> 01:03:10,871

Hurry up and finish.

01:04:18,876 --> 01:04:21,629
Your sister has
lots of chores to do for me.

You're not quite fat enough,
but you're getting fatter.
Yes.

Well, soon you'll be fat

01:04:42,036 --> 01:04:45,233
I'm getting tired.
It's been a long day.

Before I go to sleep,

773
01:04:47,276 --> 01:04:51,474
I want you to eat some more
of my delicious sweet rolls.

I won't eat any more!

You can't make me!

776
01:04:58,556 --> 01:05:00,626
You'll eat
whatever I give you,

777
01:05:04,996 --> 01:05:07,874
or I will eat
your little sister.

778
01:05:13,956 --> 01:05:16,595
She's not very big or plump,

779
01:05:17,636 --> 01:05:19,991
but she'll do
for a midnight snack.

780
01:05:21,396 --> 01:05:24,627
I'll boil her quickly
and eat her

781

Well, I'll have
no more trouble with you.

different for you to enjoy.

wait to have you

No, Hansel,
I won't leave you.

All right.
We must be bold.

You must steal

But how?
She always wears it
around her neck.

806

Carefully.
Go on, it's now or never.

You'll start now.
I need walnuts!

818
01:09:08,916 --> 01:09:12,465
You will shell and crush
a barrel of my finest walnuts!

anything done this way.

There's nothing there.

how to pound a pile of nuts.

what took you so long?

Yes. Little Hansel.

Give me your finger,
little Hansel,

860

You don't seem
a bit fatter today.

864
01:12:49,716 --> 01:12:51,468
ln fact, you seem thinner.

865
01:12:52,036 --> 01:12:54,231
There's just no meat
on your bones!

866
01:12:54,316 --> 01:12:56,876
Not even enough for me
to have a nice lunch!

867
01:13:00,516 --> 01:13:04,509
Perhaps the two of them
together would

868
01:13:04,596 --> 01:13:07,508
make one nice meal for me.
