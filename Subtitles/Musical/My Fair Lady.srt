68

Madam, it's stopped raining.

69
00:08:39,635 --> 00:08:42,024

96

00:26:55,955 --> 00:26:57,786
l won't waste another cylinder on that.

335
00:26:57,875 --> 00:26:59,433
Be off with you. l don't want you.

336
00:26:59,515 --> 00:27:02,552
Don't be so saucy.
You ain't 'eard what l come for yet.

337
00:27:02,715 --> 00:27:04,433
Did you tell 'im l come in a taxi?

338
00:27:04,515 --> 00:27:07,427
Nonsense. Do you think a gentleman
like Mr. Higgins cares...

339
00:27:07,515 --> 00:27:08,630
...what you came in?

340
00:27:08,715 --> 00:27:10,228
Oh, we are proud.

341
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:13,512
He ain't above givin' lessons, not 'im.
l 'eard 'im say so.

342
00:27:13,595 --> 00:27:15,586
l ain't come here to ask
for any compliment...

343
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,314
...and if my money's not good enough,
l can go elsewhere.

344
00:27:18,395 --> 00:27:19,794
Good enough for what?

345
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:21,627
ELlZA: Good enough for you.

346
00:27:22,635 --> 00:27:25,354
Now you know, don't ya?
l'm come to 'ave lessons.

347
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,869
And to pay for 'em, too, make no mistake.

348
00:27:27,995 --> 00:27:28,950
Well!

349
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:32,104
And what do you expect me to say?

350
00:27:32,915 --> 00:27:36,271
Well, if you was a gentleman,
you might ask me to sit down, l think.

351
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:38,949
Don't l tell you l'm bringin' you business?

352
00:27:39,675 --> 00:27:41,552
Should we ask this baggage to sit down...

353
00:27:41,635 --> 00:27:43,944
...or shall we just throw her
out of the window?

354
00:27:44,035 --> 00:27:48,267
l won't be called a baggage.
Not when l've offered to pay like any lady.

355
00:27:49,075 --> 00:27:51,305
PlCKERlNG: What do you want, my girl?

356
00:27:54,755 --> 00:27:56,507
l want to be a lady in a flow'r shop...

357
00:27:56,595 --> 00:27:59,314
...'stead of sellin' at the corner
of Tottenham Court Road.

358
00:27:59,395 --> 00:28:02,034
But they won't take me
unless l can talk more genteel.

359
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:03,343
He said 'e could teach me.

360
00:28:03,435 --> 00:28:05,426
Well, 'ere l am ready to pay 'im.

361
00:28:05,515 --> 00:28:08,632
Not asking any favor
and he treats me as if l was dirt.

362
00:28:09,275 --> 00:28:12,984
l know what lessons cost as well as you do
and l'm ready to pay.

363
00:28:15,835 --> 00:28:17,109
How much?

364
00:28:17,555 --> 00:28:19,193
Now you're talkin'.

365
00:28:19,395 --> 00:28:21,829
l thought you'd come off it
for a chance to get back...

366
00:28:21,915 --> 00:28:23,951
...a bit of what you chucked
at me last night.

367
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,673
You'd had a drop in, 'adn't you?

368
00:28:25,755 --> 00:28:26,904
Sit down.

369
00:28:27,035 --> 00:28:30,107
-lf you're goin' t' make a compliment of it--
-Sit down!

370
00:28:31,035 --> 00:28:33,151
Sit down, girl. Do as you're told.

371
00:28:33,675 --> 00:28:34,994
What's your name?

372
00:28:35,115 --> 00:28:36,707
Eliza Doolittle.

373
00:28:37,595 --> 00:28:39,950
Won't you sit down, Miss Doolittle?

374
00:28:43,675 --> 00:28:45,188
l don't mind if l do.

375
00:28:45,315 --> 00:28:47,067
[Pickering chuckles]

376
00:28:48,595 --> 00:28:51,587
How much do you propose
to pay me for these lessons?

377
00:28:51,795 --> 00:28:53,228
Oh, l know what's right.

378
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:56,068
My lady friend gets French lessons
for 18 pence an hour...

379
00:28:56,155 --> 00:28:57,986
...from a real French gentleman.

380
00:28:58,075 --> 00:29:00,305
You wouldn't have the face
to ask me the same...

381
00:29:00,395 --> 00:29:03,114
...for teachin' me my own language
as you would for French.

382
00:29:03,195 --> 00:29:06,426
l won't give more than a shillin'.
Take it or leave it.

383
00:29:08,475 --> 00:29:11,433
Do you know, Pickering,
if you think of a shilling...

384
00:29:11,675 --> 00:29:15,588
...not as a simple shilling,
but as a percentage of this girl's income...

385
00:29:15,915 --> 00:29:18,509
...it works out as fully equivalent of...

386
00:29:20,155 --> 00:29:22,510
...60 or 70 pounds from a millionaire.

387
00:29:23,315 --> 00:29:26,591
By George, it's enormous.
lt's the biggest offer l ever had.

388
00:29:26,675 --> 00:29:30,714
[Yells] Sixty pounds? What are you talkin'
about? Where would l get 60 pounds?

389
00:29:30,795 --> 00:29:33,070
-l never offered you 60 pounds!
-Hold your tongue!

390
00:29:33,155 --> 00:29:34,907
[Sobs] But l ain't got 60 pounds!

391
00:29:34,995 --> 00:29:38,431
Don't cry, silly girl. Sit down.
Nobody's going to touch your money.

392
00:29:38,515 --> 00:29:41,712
Somebody'll touch you with a broomstick
if you don't stop sniveling.

393
00:29:41,795 --> 00:29:43,148
[Yells] Sit down!

394
00:29:46,715 --> 00:29:49,149
Anybody'd think you was my father!

395
00:29:49,275 --> 00:29:52,745
lf l decide to teach you,
l'll be worse than two fathers to you.

396
00:29:53,515 --> 00:29:54,470
Here.

397
00:29:54,755 --> 00:29:55,744
What's this for?

398
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:59,464
To wipe your eyes. To wipe any part
of your face that feels moist.

399
00:29:59,675 --> 00:30:02,394
Remember, that's your handkerchief
and that's your sleeve.

400
00:30:02,475 --> 00:30:05,911
Don't confuse one with the other,
if you want to become a lady in a shop.

401
00:30:05,995 --> 00:30:09,670
lt's no use to talk to her like that.
She doesn't understand you.

402
00:30:09,755 --> 00:30:13,225
Give the 'andkerchief to me.
He give it to me, not to you!

403
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:15,306
Higgins, l'm interested.

404
00:30:15,475 --> 00:30:16,703
What about your boast...

405
00:30:16,795 --> 00:30:19,548
...you could pass her off as a duchess
at the Embassy Ball?

406
00:30:19,635 --> 00:30:22,354
l'll say you're the greatest teacher alive
if you do that.

407
00:30:22,435 --> 00:30:25,984
l'll bet you all the expenses
of the experiment that you can't do it.

408
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:28,225
I'll even pay for the lessons.

409
00:30:28,315 --> 00:30:30,829
You're real good. Thank ye, Capt'n.

410
00:30:32,275 --> 00:30:34,152
lt's almost irresistible.

411
00:30:34,435 --> 00:30:36,027
[Henry chuckles]

412
00:30:36,755 --> 00:30:38,746
She's so deliciously low.

413
00:30:39,035 --> 00:30:40,514
So horribly dirty.

414
00:30:40,635 --> 00:30:44,025
l ain't dirty! l washed my face an' hands
before l come, l did.

415
00:30:44,115 --> 00:30:47,903
l'll take it. l'll make a duchess
of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.

416
00:30:48,275 --> 00:30:51,665
We'll start today. This moment.
Take her away and clean her.

417
00:30:51,755 --> 00:30:55,031
Sandpaper, if it won't come off.
ls there a fire in the kitchen?

418
00:30:55,115 --> 00:30:58,027
Take her clothes off and burn them
and order some new ones.

419
00:30:58,115 --> 00:31:00,629
Just wrap her in brown paper
till they come.

420
00:31:01,115 --> 00:31:04,551
You're no gentleman, you're not,
to talk o' such things.

421
00:31:04,635 --> 00:31:06,068
l'm a good girl, l am.

422
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:08,828
And l know what the likes of you are, l do.

423
00:31:09,475 --> 00:31:12,547
We want none of your slum prudery here,
young woman.

424
00:31:12,795 --> 00:31:14,945
You've got to learn to behave
like a duchess.

425
00:31:15,035 --> 00:31:18,345
Take her away, Mrs. Pearce.
lf she gives you any trouble, wallop her.

426
00:31:18,435 --> 00:31:20,187
l'll call the police, l will.

427
00:31:20,275 --> 00:31:21,833
l've got no place to put her.

428
00:31:21,915 --> 00:31:23,633
Well, put her in the dustbin.

429
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:24,625
[Eliza shrieks]

430
00:31:24,835 --> 00:31:26,632
Come, Higgins, be reasonable.

431
00:31:26,715 --> 00:31:29,183
You must be reasonable,
Mr. Higgins, you must.

432
00:31:29,275 --> 00:31:31,664
You can't walk over everybody like this.

433
00:31:34,315 --> 00:31:35,304
l?

434
00:31:36,075 --> 00:31:37,793
Walk over everybody?

435
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:41,868
My dear Mrs. Pearce, my dear Pickering,
l had no intention of walking over anybody.

436
00:31:41,955 --> 00:31:44,992
l merely suggested we should be kind
to this poor girl.

437
00:31:45,115 --> 00:31:49,472
l didn't express myself clearly
because l didn't wish to hurt her delicacy...

438
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:50,944
...or yours.

439
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:53,993
But, sir, you can't take a girl up like that...

440
00:31:54,155 --> 00:31:56,669
...as if you were picking up
a pebble on the beach.

441
00:31:56,755 --> 00:31:57,870
Why not?

442
00:31:58,035 --> 00:32:00,708
Why not? But you don't know
anything about her.

443
00:32:00,795 --> 00:32:03,468
What about her parents?
She may be married.

444
00:32:03,675 --> 00:32:04,790
Garn!

445
00:32:05,195 --> 00:32:08,153
There. As the girl
very properly says, "garn! "

446
00:32:08,915 --> 00:32:10,428
Who'd marry me?

447
00:32:12,835 --> 00:32:14,553
By George, Eliza...

448
00:32:15,315 --> 00:32:18,591
...the streets will be strewn
with the bodies of men...

449
00:32:18,755 --> 00:32:22,191
...shooting themselves for your sake
before l'm done with you.

450
00:32:24,715 --> 00:32:25,830
l'm goin'.

451
00:32:26,115 --> 00:32:29,505
He's off his chump, he is.
l don't want no balmies teachin' me.

452
00:32:29,595 --> 00:32:32,632
Mad? All right, Mrs. Pearce,
don't order those new clothes.

453
00:32:32,715 --> 00:32:34,831
-Throw her out.
-Stop! l won't allow it.

454
00:32:34,915 --> 00:32:36,348
Go home to your parents, girl.

455
00:32:36,435 --> 00:32:38,107
l ain't got no parents.

456
00:32:38,315 --> 00:32:40,146
She ain't got no parents. What's the fuss?

457
00:32:40,235 --> 00:32:43,432
Nobody wants her. She's no use
to anyone but me. Take her upstairs!

458
00:32:43,515 --> 00:32:46,427
MRS. PEARCE: What's to become of her?
ls she to be paid anything?

459
00:32:46,515 --> 00:32:47,743
Do be sensible, sir.

460
00:32:47,835 --> 00:32:50,224
What'd she do with money?
She'll have food and clothes.

461
00:32:50,315 --> 00:32:51,828
She'll drink if you give her money.

462
00:32:51,915 --> 00:32:53,587
You are a brute! lt's a lie!

463
00:32:53,675 --> 00:32:56,064
Nobody ever saw the sign o' liquor on me.

464
00:32:56,155 --> 00:32:59,113
Sir, you're a gentleman.
Don't let 'im speak to me like that!

465
00:32:59,195 --> 00:33:02,267
Does it occur to you, Higgins,
the girl has some feelings?

466
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:05,347
No, l don't think so.
No feelings we need worry about.

467
00:33:05,555 --> 00:33:06,590
Well, have you, Eliza?

468
00:33:06,675 --> 00:33:08,905
l got me feelings same as anyone else.

469
00:33:08,995 --> 00:33:12,146
Mr. Higgins, l must know on what terms
the girl is to be here.

470
00:33:12,235 --> 00:33:14,544
What'll become of her
when you've finished teaching?

471
00:33:14,635 --> 00:33:16,387
You must look ahead a little, sir.

472
00:33:16,475 --> 00:33:19,592
What'll become of her if we leave her
in the gutter, Mrs. Pearce?

473
00:33:19,675 --> 00:33:21,905
That's her own business,
not yours, Mr. Higgins.

474
00:33:21,995 --> 00:33:23,474
When l'm done, we'll throw her back.

475
00:33:23,555 --> 00:33:26,752
Then it'll be her own business again.
That'll be all right, won't it?

476
00:33:26,835 --> 00:33:29,065
You've no feelin' 'eart in ya!

477
00:33:29,555 --> 00:33:31,944
You don't care for nothin' but yourself.

478
00:33:32,155 --> 00:33:34,271
l've 'ad enough of this. l'm goin'!

479
00:33:34,355 --> 00:33:36,311
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!

480
00:33:36,395 --> 00:33:38,226
Have some chocolates, Eliza.

481
00:33:44,715 --> 00:33:46,353
'Ow do l know what might be in 'em?

482
00:33:46,435 --> 00:33:49,427
l've 'eard of girls bein' drugged
by the likes o' you.

483
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:51,308
Pledge of good faith.

484
00:33:51,955 --> 00:33:53,434
l'll take one half.

485
00:33:54,275 --> 00:33:55,913
And you take the other.

486
00:33:59,235 --> 00:34:02,193
You'll have boxes of them,
barrels of them every day.

487
00:34:02,555 --> 00:34:04,193
You'll live on them, eh?

488
00:34:05,595 --> 00:34:08,985
l wouldn't 've ate it, only l'm too ladylike
to take it out o' me mouth.

489
00:34:09,075 --> 00:34:12,431
Think of it, Eliza.
Think of chocolates, and taxis...

490
00:34:12,755 --> 00:34:14,746
...and gold and diamonds.

491
00:34:15,235 --> 00:34:16,270
[Eliza shrieks]

492
00:34:16,355 --> 00:34:19,950
l don't want no gold and no diamonds.
l'm a good girl, l am.

493
00:34:20,315 --> 00:34:23,466
Higgins, l really must interfere.
Mrs. Pearce is quite right.

494
00:34:23,555 --> 00:34:26,433
lf this girl will put herself
in your hands for six months...

495
00:34:26,515 --> 00:34:30,872
...for an experiment in teaching, she must
understand thoroughly what she's doing.

496
00:34:33,555 --> 00:34:34,749
Eliza....

497
00:34:34,835 --> 00:34:36,871

for the next six months...

498
00:34:36,955 --> 00:34:40,789
...learning how to speak beautifully
like a lady in a florist shop.

499
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:45,504

you'll sleep in a proper bedroom...

500
00:34:45,595 --> 00:34:49,713
...have lots to eat, money
to buy chocolates and take rides in taxis.

501
00:34:50,835 --> 00:34:53,110
But if you are naughty and idle...

502
00:34:53,195 --> 00:34:55,914
...you'll sleep in the kitchen
amongst the black beetles...

503
00:34:55,995 --> 00:34:58,907
...and be walloped by Mrs. Pearce
with a broomstick.

504
00:35:00,195 --> 00:35:03,870
At the end of six months,
you shall be taken to Buckingham Palace...

505
00:35:04,195 --> 00:35:06,504
...in a carriage, beautifully dressed.

506
00:35:07,675 --> 00:35:10,508

that you are not a lady...

507
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:14,748
...the police will take you to the Tower
of London where your head will be cut off...

508
00:35:14,835 --> 00:35:17,713
...as a warning to other
presumptuous flower girls.

509
00:35:18,675 --> 00:35:21,985
But if you are not found out,
you shall have a present of...

510
00:35:23,035 --> 00:35:26,107
...seven and six to start life with
as a lady in a shop.

511
00:35:27,355 --> 00:35:29,232
lf you refuse this offer...

512
00:35:29,315 --> 00:35:32,512
...you will be the most ungrateful,
wicked girl...

513
00:35:33,595 --> 00:35:36,109
...and the angels will weep for you!

514
00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:43,194
Are you satisfied, Pickering?

515
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:45,266

what you're talking about.

516
00:35:45,355 --> 00:35:47,710
Could l put it more plainly or fairly,
Mrs. Pearce?

517

Come with me.

518
00:35:48,755 --> 00:35:51,394
That's right.
Bundle her off to the bathroom.

519
00:35:51,475 --> 00:35:53,306

520

524
00:36:06,355 --> 00:36:08,994

and l'll pass her off as anything.

if you're dirty outside.

529
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:28,947

This will be your bedroom.

530

What's this?
This where you wash clothes?

535
00:36:51,595 --> 00:36:55,474
This is where we wash ourselves, Eliza.
And where l'm going to wash you.

536

no advantage is to be taken of her position.

555

What, that thing? Sacred, l assure you.

556
00:38:38,875 --> 00:38:41,753
Come now, you know what l mean.
This is no trifling matter.

Are you a man of good character
where women are concerned?

Have you ever met a man of good
character where women are concerned?

559
00:38:49,355 --> 00:38:51,152
Yes, very frequently.

560
00:38:51,435 --> 00:38:54,632
l haven't. The moment l let a woman
make friends with me...

561
00:38:54,715 --> 00:38:56,910
...she becomes jealous, exacting...

562
00:38:56,995 --> 00:38:59,145
...suspicious and a damned nuisance.

563
00:38:59,395 --> 00:39:03,354
The moment that l make friends with
a woman l become selfish and tyrannical.

564

lf l thought they wasn't, l'd ask 50.

834

You mean, you'd sell your daughter

836

No, l can't afford 'em, Governor. Neither
could you if you was as poor as me.

Think what that means to a man.

843
00:54:28,035 --> 00:54:31,584
lt means he's up against
middle-class morality for all the time.

844
00:54:32,155 --> 00:54:35,943
lf there's anything goin' an' l ask
for a bit of it, it's always the same story:

845
00:54:36,035 --> 00:54:38,549
"You're undeservin', so you can't have it."

846
00:54:38,715 --> 00:54:42,549
But my needs is as great as the most
deservin' widows that ever got money...

847
00:54:42,635 --> 00:54:46,947
...out of six different charities in one week
for the death o' the same 'usband.

848
00:54:47,035 --> 00:54:50,345
l don't need less than a deservin' man,
l need more.

and l drink...

852
00:54:57,955 --> 00:55:01,504

No, l'm undeservin'...

853
00:55:01,995 --> 00:55:05,874
...and l mean to go on bein' undeservin'.
l like it an' that's the truth.

854
00:55:05,955 --> 00:55:09,072
But will you take advantage
of a man's nature...

855
00:55:09,635 --> 00:55:12,945
...do him out of the price of
his own daughter, what he's brought up...

856
00:55:13,035 --> 00:55:15,629
...fed and clothed
by the sweat of his brow...

857
00:55:16,315 --> 00:55:20,627

to be interestin' to you two gentlemen?

859
00:55:26,195 --> 00:55:27,753
And l leave it to you.

860
00:55:30,475 --> 00:55:33,911
You know, Pickering, if we took this man
in hand for three months...

861
00:55:33,995 --> 00:55:38,227
...he could choose between a seat in
the Cabinet and a popular pulpit in Wales.

862
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:42,025
-We'd better give 'im a fiver.
-He'll make bad use of it, l'm afraid.

it ain't been throwed away.

867

ALFlE: You couldn't spend it better.

868
00:55:54,675 --> 00:55:57,314
This is irresistible. Let's give 'im ten.

869
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:59,511
The missus wouldn't have the 'eart
to spend ten.

870
00:55:59,595 --> 00:56:01,233
Ten pounds is a lot o' money.

871
00:56:01,315 --> 00:56:04,705
Makes a man feel prudent-like,
and then goodbye to 'appiness.

872
00:56:05,115 --> 00:56:08,994
No, you just give me what l ask, Governor.
Not a penny less, not a penny more.

873

this sort of immorality.

Why don't you marry that missus of yours?

875
00:56:14,435 --> 00:56:17,711
After all, marriage isn't so frightening.
You married Eliza's mother.

876
00:56:17,795 --> 00:56:19,353
Who told you that, Governor?

877
00:56:19,435 --> 00:56:22,154

we'll have no convictions left.

879

-Five pounds, l think you said.
-Thank you, Governor.

880
00:56:32,195 --> 00:56:33,514
Are you sure you won't have ten?

881
00:56:33,595 --> 00:56:35,586
No. No, perhaps another time.

888

What are you doin' here?

889
00:56:50,635 --> 00:56:54,913
Now, you hold your tongue and don't
you give these gentlemen none o' your lip.

with Mr. Doolittle...

the most original moralists in England.

What did he come for?

898
00:57:23,795 --> 00:57:24,784

for sympathy.

00:57:50,635 --> 00:57:53,547
Very well, if you insist,
but have a little patience with her.

910

LADY BOXlNGTON: And the whole
of our family is susceptible to it.

1294

My aunt died of influenza, so they said.

1295
01:24:56,795 --> 01:24:59,787
But it's my belief they done
the old woman in.

1296
01:25:01,595 --> 01:25:03,313
MRS. HlGGlNS: Done her in?

1297

Yes, Lord love you.

1298
01:25:05,315 --> 01:25:07,465
Why should she die of influenza...

1299
01:25:07,715 --> 01:25:11,344
...when she'd come through diphtheria
right enough the year before.

1300
01:25:11,595 --> 01:25:13,711
Fairly blue with it she was.

1301
01:25:14,355 --> 01:25:16,152
They all thought she was dead.

1302
01:25:16,235 --> 01:25:19,511
But my father, he kept ladling gin
down her throat.

1303
01:25:24,955 --> 01:25:28,584
Then she come to so sudden
she bit the bowl off the spoon.

1304
01:25:30,395 --> 01:25:31,623
Dear me!

1305
01:25:32,915 --> 01:25:36,112
Now what call would a woman
with that strength in her...

1306
01:25:36,195 --> 01:25:38,026
...have to die of influenza?

1307
01:25:38,715 --> 01:25:42,708
And what become of her new straw hat
that should have come to me?

1308
01:25:45,315 --> 01:25:47,067
Somebody pinched it.

1309
01:25:48,755 --> 01:25:50,427
And what l say is:

1310
01:25:50,675 --> 01:25:53,064
Them 'as pinched it, done her in.

1311
01:25:54,715 --> 01:25:57,149
Done her in? "Done her in," did you say?

1312
01:25:57,835 --> 01:25:59,427
Whatever does it mean?

1313
01:25:59,555 --> 01:26:03,628
That's the new small talk.
"To do somebody in" means to kill them.

1314
01:26:04,595 --> 01:26:07,553
But you surely don't believe
your aunt was killed?

1315
01:26:08,115 --> 01:26:09,343
Do l not?

1316
01:26:09,475 --> 01:26:13,866
Them she lived with would have killed her
for a hatpin, let alone a hat.

1317
01:26:14,155 --> 01:26:17,192
MRS. HlGGlNS: But it can't have been right
for your father...

1318
01:26:17,275 --> 01:26:19,869
...to pour spirits down her throat like that.

1319
01:26:20,155 --> 01:26:21,747
lt might have killed her.

1320
01:26:21,835 --> 01:26:24,508
Not her. Gin was mother's milk to her.

1321
01:26:25,835 --> 01:26:30,113
Besides, he poured so much down
his own throat he knew the good of it.

1322
01:26:31,475 --> 01:26:33,147
Do you mean that he drank?

1323
01:26:33,235 --> 01:26:35,749
Drank? My word. Something chronic.

You do it so awfully well.

1327
01:26:46,435 --> 01:26:49,950
Well, if l was doing it proper,
what was you sniggering at?

1328

1330
01:26:54,915 --> 01:26:56,428
Not at all, my dear.

1331

Well, that's a mercy anyhow.

1332
01:27:01,395 --> 01:27:04,785

No, thank you.

Well, it's only natural that you should
be anxious, but it's all over now.

Nothing more to worry about.

1668

Why? ln heaven's name, why?

1671
01:57:12,514 --> 01:57:16,109
Now listen to me, Eliza.
All this irritation is purely subjective.

1672
01:57:16,474 --> 01:57:18,624

1673
01:57:18,714 --> 01:57:22,070
lt's just imagination. Nothing's wrong.
Nobody's hurting you.

1674

Go to bed and sleep it off.

1675
01:57:23,394 --> 01:57:27,672
Have a little cry and say your prayers.
You'll feel very much more comfortable.

Don't you thank God it's all over?

1679

Now you're free,
and you can do what you like.

1680

Oh, what am l fit for?
What have you left me fit for?

1681

Where am l to go? What am l to do?

1682
01:57:42,754 --> 01:57:44,745
And what's to become of me?

1683
01:57:45,794 --> 01:57:48,228
That's what's worrying you, is it?

1684
01:57:50,074 --> 01:57:51,951
l wouldn't worry about that if l were you.

1685
01:57:52,034 --> 01:57:56,266

in settling yourself somewhere or other.

1688

old bachelors like me and the Colonel.

1689

poor devils.

1702

Don't insult human relations...

about buying and selling into it.

1707
01:59:00,274 --> 01:59:02,583
What about the old idea of a florist shop?

1708
01:59:02,674 --> 01:59:05,586
l'm sure Pickering'd set you up in one.
He's got lots of money.

1709
01:59:05,674 --> 01:59:07,551
He'll pay for all those togs you're wearing.

1710
01:59:07,634 --> 01:59:11,547
And that with the hire of the jewelry'll
make a big hole in 200 pounds.

1715

ELlZA: Before you go, sir.

1717
01:59:32,914 --> 01:59:35,792
Do my clothes belong to me
or to Colonel Pickering?

1718

What the devil use would they be
to Pickering?

1719
01:59:39,034 --> 01:59:40,945

in the middle of the night?

We must visit it more often.

Father?

1851
02:10:24,074 --> 02:10:26,872
Oh, no. You see, Harry, he has no mercy.

1852
02:10:27,554 --> 02:10:31,467
Sent her down to spy on me in me misery,
he did. Me own flesh and blood.

1853
02:10:34,314 --> 02:10:37,272
Well, l'm miserable, all right.
You can tell him that straight.

1854
02:10:37,354 --> 02:10:39,914
What are you talking about?
What are you dressed up for?

1855
02:10:39,994 --> 02:10:41,347
As if you didn't know.

1856
02:10:41,434 --> 02:10:45,268
Go on back to that Wimpole Street devil.
Tell him what he's done to me.

1857
02:10:45,474 --> 02:10:47,032
What's he done to you?

1858
02:10:47,434 --> 02:10:48,628
Ruined me, that's all.

1859
02:10:48,714 --> 02:10:52,389
Tied me up and delivered me
into the hands of middle-class morality.

1860
02:10:52,794 --> 02:10:54,113
And don't you defend him.

1861
02:10:54,194 --> 02:10:58,551

American blighter named Wallingford...

1862

...who was giving $5,000,000
to found Moral Reform societies...

1863
02:11:03,114 --> 02:11:07,505
...to tell him the most original moralist
in England was Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle...

1864
02:11:07,594 --> 02:11:09,073
...a common dustman?

1865
02:11:10,514 --> 02:11:12,391
Sounds like one of his jokes.

1866
02:11:12,554 --> 02:11:15,626
You may call it a joke.
lt's put the lid on me. Proper.

1867
02:11:15,914 --> 02:11:19,987
The old bloke died and left me
4,000 pounds a year in his bloomin' will.

1868
02:11:21,354 --> 02:11:25,313
Who asked him to make a gentleman
outta me? l was 'appy. l was free.

1869
02:11:25,874 --> 02:11:29,913
l touched pretty nigh everyone for money
when l wanted it, same as l touched him.

1870
02:11:29,994 --> 02:11:33,350
Now l'm tied neck and 'eels
and everybody touches me.

1871
02:11:34,154 --> 02:11:36,907
A year ago l 'adn't a relation in the world...

1872
02:11:37,594 --> 02:11:39,585
...except one or two
who wouldn't speak to me.

1873
02:11:39,674 --> 02:11:43,144
Now l've 50. Not a decent week's wages
amongst the lot of them.

1874
02:11:43,754 --> 02:11:48,032
l have to live for others now,
not for meself. Middle-class morality.

1875
02:11:48,914 --> 02:11:52,111
Come on, Alfie, in a few hours
we have to be at the church.

1876

-Church?
-Yeah, church.

1877
02:11:55,274 --> 02:11:57,105
The deepest cut of all.

1878
02:11:57,594 --> 02:12:00,666
Why do you think l'm dressed up
like a ruddy pallbearer?

1879
02:12:01,194 --> 02:12:03,025
Your stepmother wants to marry me.

1880
02:12:03,114 --> 02:12:05,833
Now l'm respectable,
she wants to be respectable.

1881
02:12:05,914 --> 02:12:09,350
ELlZA: lf that's the way you feel,
why don't you give the money back?

1882
02:12:09,434 --> 02:12:11,425
That's the tragedy of it, Eliza.

1883
02:12:11,674 --> 02:12:13,471
lt's easy to say chuck it...

1884
02:12:14,274 --> 02:12:16,026
...but l 'aven't the nerve.

1885
02:12:16,354 --> 02:12:18,868
We're all intimidated.
That's what we are, intimidated.

1886
02:12:18,954 --> 02:12:21,468
Bought up. Yeah. That's what l am.

1887
02:12:22,234 --> 02:12:24,794
That's what your precious professor's
brought me to.

1888
02:12:24,874 --> 02:12:26,785
Not my precious professor.

1889
02:12:27,474 --> 02:12:29,305
Oh, sent you back, 'as he?

1890
02:12:30,914 --> 02:12:35,624
First he shoves me in the middle-class,
then he chucks you out for me to support.

1891
02:12:36,234 --> 02:12:38,145
That's all part of his plan...

1892
02:12:38,754 --> 02:12:40,585
...but you double-cross him.

1893
02:12:41,154 --> 02:12:45,113
Don't you come back home to me.
Don't you take tuppence from me.

1894
02:12:45,714 --> 02:12:49,104
You stand on your own two feet.
You're a lady now, you can do it.

1895
02:12:49,194 --> 02:12:51,833
Yeah, that's right, Eliza.
You're a lady now.

instead of coffee.

1989
02:19:37,794 --> 02:19:40,354

what my appointments are.

-Eliza'd know.
-Damn it, she's gone!

1991
02:19:42,234 --> 02:19:44,270
Did either of you frighten her last night?

1992
02:19:44,354 --> 02:19:46,470
We hardly said a word to her.
You were there.

1993
02:19:46,554 --> 02:19:48,306
Did you bully her after l went to bed?

1994
02:19:48,394 --> 02:19:49,713
She threw the slippers at me.

1995
02:19:49,794 --> 02:19:51,625
l never gave her the slightest provocation.

1996
02:19:51,714 --> 02:19:54,103
The slippers came at my head
before l uttered a word.

1997
02:19:54,194 --> 02:19:57,903
She used the most disgraceful language.
l was shocked! l don't understand.

1998
02:19:57,994 --> 02:20:00,554
We always gave her every consideration.
She admitted it.

1999
02:20:00,634 --> 02:20:01,464
l'm dashed!

2000
02:20:01,554 --> 02:20:04,944
Pickering, for God's sake,
stop being dashed and do something!

2001
02:20:05,034 --> 02:20:07,548
Phone the police. What are they there for?

2002
02:20:07,634 --> 02:20:10,023
You can't give Eliza's name to the police...

2003
02:20:10,114 --> 02:20:12,150
...as if she were a thief or a lost umbrella.

2004
02:20:12,234 --> 02:20:14,065
But why not? l want to find the girl.

2005
02:20:14,154 --> 02:20:16,748
She belongs to me.
l paid five pounds for her.

2006
02:20:16,994 --> 02:20:19,554
Quite right. Hello. Scotland Yard, please?

2007
02:20:19,874 --> 02:20:22,104

2015

Her eyes? Let me think now. Her eyes....

2016
02:20:48,754 --> 02:20:50,233
-Brown.
-Brown.

2017
02:20:53,074 --> 02:20:56,862

2022

No.... She's no relation, no.

2025
02:21:17,874 --> 02:21:20,513
Listen to me, l don't like the tenor
of that question.

2026
02:21:20,594 --> 02:21:22,869
What the girl does here is our affair.

2027
02:21:24,114 --> 02:21:27,424
Your affair is to get her back
so she can continue doing it.

02:28:14,114 --> 02:28:16,150
I'll always be a lady to Colonel Pickering...

2151
02:28:16,234 --> 02:28:19,385
...because he always treats me
as a lady and always will.

2152
02:28:22,474 --> 02:28:23,953
[Henry groans]

2153
02:28:24,074 --> 02:28:25,473
Henry, don't grind your teeth.

2154
02:28:25,554 --> 02:28:28,273
The bishop is here.
Shall l show him into the garden?

2155
02:28:28,354 --> 02:28:30,743
The bishop and the professor?
Good heavens, no!

2156
02:28:30,834 --> 02:28:32,586
l should be excommunicated.

2157
02:28:32,874 --> 02:28:34,705
l'll see him in the library.

2158
02:28:35,434 --> 02:28:37,994
Eliza, if my son starts breaking up things...

2159
02:28:38,194 --> 02:28:40,788
...l give you full permission
to have him evicted.

2160
02:28:40,874 --> 02:28:44,913
Henry, l suggest you stick to two subjects:
the weather and your health.

2161
02:29:11,594 --> 02:29:13,550
You've had a bit of your own back,
as you say.

2162
02:29:13,634 --> 02:29:16,910
Have you had enough and will you
be reasonable or do you want any more?

2163
02:29:16,994 --> 02:29:18,905
You want me back to pick up
your slippers...

2164
02:29:18,994 --> 02:29:21,906
...and put up with your tempers
and fetch and carry for you.

2165
02:29:21,994 --> 02:29:23,712
l didn't say l wanted you back at all.

2166
02:29:23,794 --> 02:29:25,113
Then what are we talking about?

2167
02:29:25,194 --> 02:29:26,752
Well, about you, not about me.

2168
02:29:26,834 --> 02:29:29,428
lf you come back you'll be treated
as you always have.

2169
02:29:29,514 --> 02:29:31,664
l can't change my nature or my manners.

2170
02:29:31,754 --> 02:29:34,473
My manners are exactly
the same as Colonel Pickering's.

2171
02:29:34,554 --> 02:29:38,183
That's not true. He treats a flower girl
as if she were a duchess.

2172
02:29:38,314 --> 02:29:40,464
l treat a duchess
as if she was a flower girl.

2173
02:29:40,554 --> 02:29:42,624
l see. The same to everybody.

2174
02:29:43,074 --> 02:29:45,713
The great secret is not a question
of good manners...

2175
02:29:45,794 --> 02:29:49,104
...or bad manners
or any particular sort of manner...

2176
02:29:49,594 --> 02:29:52,791
...but having the same manner
for all human souls.

2177
02:29:54,634 --> 02:29:56,943
The question is not
whether l treat you rudely...

2178
02:29:57,034 --> 02:30:00,310
...but whether you've ever heard me
treat anyone else better.

2179
02:30:00,394 --> 02:30:02,271
l don't care how you treat me.

2180
02:30:02,354 --> 02:30:05,312
l don't mind your swearing at me.
l shouldn't mind a black eye.

2181
02:30:05,394 --> 02:30:08,352
l've had one before this.
But l won't be passed over!

2182
02:30:08,554 --> 02:30:10,351
Get out of my way,
for l won't stop for you.

2183
02:30:10,434 --> 02:30:12,470
You talk about me as though
l was a motorbus.

2184
02:30:12,554 --> 02:30:16,593
So you are a motorbus. All bounce and go
and no consideration for anybody.

2185
02:30:16,834 --> 02:30:19,473
But l can get along without you.
Don't you think l can't!

2186
02:30:19,554 --> 02:30:21,863
l know you can. l told you, you could.

2187
02:30:25,154 --> 02:30:27,622
You've never wondered, l suppose,
whether...

2188
02:30:27,714 --> 02:30:30,148
...whether l could get along without you?

2189
02:30:31,194 --> 02:30:34,106
Don't you try to get around me.
You'll have to.

2190
02:30:35,274 --> 02:30:37,788
So l can, without you or any soul on earth.

2191
02:30:40,794 --> 02:30:44,833
l shall miss you, Eliza. l've learned
something from your idiotic notions.

2192
02:30:45,474 --> 02:30:47,908
l confess that humbly and gratefully.

2193
02:30:50,754 --> 02:30:53,029
Well, you have my voice
on your gramophone.

2194
02:30:53,114 --> 02:30:57,426
When you feel lonely without me you can
turn it on. lt has no feelings to hurt.

2195
02:30:58,874 --> 02:31:01,513
[Sighs] Well, l can't turn your soul on.

2196
02:31:04,074 --> 02:31:05,666
You are a devil!

2197
02:31:07,154 --> 02:31:09,543
You can twist the heart in a girl
just as easily...

2198
02:31:09,634 --> 02:31:11,989
...as some can twist her arms to hurt her.

2199
02:31:12,074 --> 02:31:13,826
What am l to come back for?

2200
02:31:14,154 --> 02:31:16,145
For the fun of it. That's why l took you on.

2201
02:31:16,234 --> 02:31:18,873
You may throw me out tomorrow
if l don't do everything you want.

2202
02:31:18,954 --> 02:31:22,230
Yes. And you may walk out tomorrow
if l don't do everything you want.

2203
02:31:22,314 --> 02:31:23,463
And live with my father?

2204
02:31:23,554 --> 02:31:25,988
Yes, or sell flowers.
Would you rather marry Pickering?

2205
02:31:26,074 --> 02:31:29,669
l wouldn't marry you if you asked me
and you're nearer my age then what he is.

2206
02:31:29,754 --> 02:31:32,826
-Than he is.
-l'll talk as l like, you're not my teacher.

2207
02:31:32,914 --> 02:31:35,633
That's not what l want
and don't you think it is.

2208
02:31:35,714 --> 02:31:37,864
l've always had chaps enough
wanting me that way.

2209
02:31:37,954 --> 02:31:40,912
Freddy Hill writes me twice
and three times a day. Sheets and sheets.

2210
02:31:40,994 --> 02:31:44,782
ln short, you want me to be
as infatuated about you as he is, is that it?

2211
02:31:44,874 --> 02:31:48,662
No, l don't. That's not the sort of feeling
l want from you.

2212
02:31:49,754 --> 02:31:51,426
l want a little kindness.

2213
02:31:51,834 --> 02:31:55,383
l know l'm a common, ignorant girl,
and you're a book-learned gentleman...

2214
02:31:55,474 --> 02:31:57,624
...but l'm not dirt under your feet.

2215
02:31:57,874 --> 02:32:01,867
What l done...what l did was not
for the taxis and the dresses...

2216
02:32:03,074 --> 02:32:06,589
...but because we were pleasant together
and l come to...came...

2217
02:32:07,874 --> 02:32:09,307
...to care for you.

2218
02:32:09,594 --> 02:32:11,312
Not to want you to make love to me...

2219
02:32:11,394 --> 02:32:14,352
...and not forgetting the difference
between us, but...

2220
02:32:14,434 --> 02:32:16,026
...more friendly like.

2221
02:32:18,154 --> 02:32:20,304
Well, of course. That's how l feel.

2222
02:32:20,914 --> 02:32:23,906
And how Pickering feels.
Eliza, you're a fool!

2223
02:32:24,434 --> 02:32:25,753
That's not the proper answer.

2224
02:32:25,834 --> 02:32:27,711
lt's the only answer
till you stop being an idiot.

2225
02:32:27,794 --> 02:32:29,864
To be a lady, you must stop
feeling neglected...

2226
02:32:29,954 --> 02:32:32,468
...if men don't spend half their time
sniveling over you...

2227
02:32:32,554 --> 02:32:34,510
...and the other half giving you black eyes.

2228
02:32:34,594 --> 02:32:36,903
You find me cold, unfeeling, selfish,
don't you?

2229
02:32:36,994 --> 02:32:38,985
Off with you to the sort of people you like.

2230
02:32:39,074 --> 02:32:40,905
Marry a sentimental hog
with lots of money...

2231
02:32:40,994 --> 02:32:43,633
...and thick lips to kiss you,
and thick boots to kick you.

2232
02:32:43,714 --> 02:32:46,751
lf you can't appreciate what you have,
then get what you can appreciate.

2233
02:32:47,074 --> 02:32:49,793
l can't talk to you.
You always turn everything against me.

2234
02:32:49,874 --> 02:32:51,512
l'm always in the wrong.

2235
02:32:51,714 --> 02:32:53,864
Don't be too sure you have me
under your feet...

2236
02:32:53,954 --> 02:32:55,990
...to be trampled on and talked down.

2237
02:32:56,074 --> 02:32:59,464
l'll marry Freddy, l will,
as soon as l'm able to support him.

2238
02:32:59,674 --> 02:33:00,663
Freddy!

2239
02:33:00,874 --> 02:33:03,388
The poor devil who couldn't get a job
as an errand boy...

2240
02:33:03,474 --> 02:33:05,351
...even if he had the guts to try?

2241
02:33:05,434 --> 02:33:09,029
Don't you understand?
l have made you a consort for a king!

2242
02:33:09,194 --> 02:33:12,027
Freddy loves me.
That makes him king enough for me.

2243
02:33:12,114 --> 02:33:14,992
l don't want him to work.
He wasn't brought up to do it as l was.

2244
02:33:15,074 --> 02:33:16,746
l'll go and be a teacher.

2245
02:33:17,154 --> 02:33:19,065
What'll you teach, in heaven's name?

2246
02:33:19,154 --> 02:33:21,588
What you taught me. l'll teach phonetics.

2247
02:33:22,234 --> 02:33:23,713
[Henry jeers]

2248
02:33:25,794 --> 02:33:29,628
l'll offer myself as an assistant
to that brilliant Hungarian.

2249
02:33:30,714 --> 02:33:34,229
What, that imposter? That humbug?
That toadying ignoramus?

2250
02:33:34,594 --> 02:33:36,664
Teach him my methods, my discoveries?

2251
02:33:36,754 --> 02:33:39,268
You take one step in that direction,
l'll wring your neck!

2252
02:33:39,354 --> 02:33:42,664
Wring away! What do l care?
l knew you'd strike me one day.

2253
02:33:42,994 --> 02:33:44,473
[Henry sighs]

2254
02:33:45,794 --> 02:33:48,262
That's done you, 'Enry 'lggins, it 'as.

2255
02:33:48,354 --> 02:33:50,709
