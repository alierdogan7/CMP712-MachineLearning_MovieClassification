1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,552
<i>Here's what you missed on Glee.</i>
BRAZIL

2
00:00:01,553 --> 00:00:03,981
<i>Will's wife put the "Terri"
in "terrible relationship,"</i>

3
00:00:03,982 --> 00:00:06,065
<i>- so now she's his ex-wife.</i>
- What is wrong with you?

4
00:00:06,066 --> 00:00:07,599
<i>Kurt met this kid Blaine
who he really likes</i>

5
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:09,584
<i>and he seems really nice,
but he sings in the Glee Club</i>

6
00:00:09,585 --> 00:00:11,290
<i>at another school.
They're called The Warblers.</i>

7
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:13,071
The Warblers are like rock stars.

8
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:14,873
<i>Kurt isn't liking his
own school at all, because</i>

9
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:16,475
<i>Karofsky's been coming after him,
and nobody knows why.</i>

10
00:00:16,542 --> 00:00:17,943
You can't punch the gay out of me

11
00:00:18,011 --> 00:00:19,411
any more than I can punch
the ignoramus out of you.

12
00:00:19,479 --> 00:00:21,191
<i>Well, Kurt knows why,
but he hasn't told anyone.</i>

13
00:00:21,192 --> 00:00:22,886
<i>And that's what you missed on...
Glee!</i>

14
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:31,252
Morning, Sue.

15
00:00:31,253 --> 00:00:32,834
Oh, I'm gonna stop you right there.

16
00:00:33,326 --> 00:00:34,326
That's Principal Sue.

17
00:00:34,828 --> 00:00:35,424
What?

18
00:00:35,425 --> 00:00:36,728
Oh, you heard me right.

19
00:00:36,796 --> 00:00:40,825
My years-long quest for power
has finally bore fruit.

20
00:00:40,893 --> 00:00:41,926
Wait, what happened to Figgins?

21
00:00:41,994 --> 00:00:44,163
Well, you need to start
listening to the news, William.

22
00:00:44,263 --> 00:00:46,330
A particularly virulent
strain of monkey flu

23
00:00:46,398 --> 00:00:49,247
has arrived in Ohio from Borneo,
where it had been festering

24
00:00:49,248 --> 00:00:52,503
in a small clutch of loud,
bisexual primates,

25
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:54,920
not unlike your very Glee Club.

26
00:00:55,106 --> 00:00:57,875
How...
How did Figgins get it?

27
00:00:57,943 --> 00:01:00,011
And that's what it
means to be an American.

28
00:01:00,078 --> 00:01:01,913
- I think I have a fever.
- Can it.

29
00:01:03,348 --> 00:01:04,682
Now.

30
00:01:17,562 --> 00:01:18,644
'Sup?

31
00:01:19,949 --> 00:01:21,368
So Figgins is sick.

32
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:22,969
How does that make you principal?

33
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,436
Well, through the blackmail
of prominent local politicians,

34
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:28,873
I strong-armed some extraordinarily broad
clauses into my contract.

35
00:01:28,941 --> 00:01:30,374
My first order of business?

36
00:01:30,442 --> 00:01:32,143
Destroy the Glee Club.

37
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,744
I... I thought we were friends.

38
00:01:33,812 --> 00:01:35,513
That got boring.

39
00:01:48,393 --> 00:01:50,728
<i>Just one of the perks of
being a high school teacher:</i>

40
00:01:50,796 --> 00:01:53,030
<i>Constant exposure to illness.</i>

41
00:01:53,098 --> 00:01:54,799
All right, guys, um...

42
00:01:55,723 --> 00:01:58,102
Time to start thinking
about song selections.

43
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,237
<i>I mean, I feel like I might have a fever,</i>

44
00:02:00,305 --> 00:02:01,539
<i>but it's important
that I power through it.</i>

45
00:02:07,546 --> 00:02:10,648
<i>Okay.
I definitely have a fever.</i>

46
00:02:10,716 --> 00:02:12,483
Lookin' good, Puckerman.

47
00:02:12,551 --> 00:02:15,052
Someone's been eating their wheaties.

48
00:02:15,551 --> 00:02:17,507
These guns are fully loaded.

49
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,242
Mr. Shue?
I, for one,

50
00:02:20,243 --> 00:02:22,927
think we should use our
set list for sectionals

51
00:02:22,995 --> 00:02:26,397
to start exploring the oeuvre
of one Bernadette Peters.

52
00:02:26,465 --> 00:02:30,368
Someday, I'm gonna go to
Paris and visit the oeuvre.

53
00:02:30,435 --> 00:02:31,969
I just want to dance.

54
00:02:32,037 --> 00:02:34,772
Mr. Schuester,
you look a little green.

55
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,608
Um...
I think I'm gonna go see the nurse.

56
00:02:39,611 --> 00:02:42,446
But first I feel like I
should get you guys a sitter.

57
00:02:42,514 --> 00:02:46,017
<i>At this point, it would be a good idea
to add any of your aromatics, like...</i>

58
00:02:54,713 --> 00:02:57,146
<i>We're going to cover the pan
until the clams open up...</i>

59
00:02:57,462 --> 00:02:58,929
I can take care of myself.

60
00:02:58,997 --> 00:03:00,898
Is that why Mrs. Weiss
called me from next door?

61
00:03:00,966 --> 00:03:03,886
Because, according to her,
she's here morning and night.

62
00:03:03,887 --> 00:03:04,664
Lift your head up.

63
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:06,704
You're making me feel worse.

64
00:03:06,772 --> 00:03:08,072
Oh, honey.

65
00:03:11,376 --> 00:03:12,710
I'm probably revealing too much,

66
00:03:12,778 --> 00:03:14,045
but I do still love you.

67
00:03:14,731 --> 00:03:16,622
And you have to admit,
no matter how toxic

68
00:03:16,623 --> 00:03:18,817
our marriage was,
I was really good

69
00:03:18,818 --> 00:03:20,284
at taking care of you when you were sick.

70
00:03:20,352 --> 00:03:22,553
That's because you like
me best when I'm weak.

71
00:03:22,621 --> 00:03:23,788
Maybe.

72
00:03:23,855 --> 00:03:25,723
I mean,
that's what my therapist says.

73
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,191
You're seeing a therapist?

74
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:28,692
And I'm medicating, too.

75
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,896
Now roll over,
and pull your pants down,

76
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:34,574
- because we're gonna take baby's temperature.
- No.

77
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,602
But baby knows it's the only way
that we can get an accurate reading.

78
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,739
Stop, Terri.

79
00:03:41,807 --> 00:03:43,674
I don't want to play sick baby with you.

80
00:03:43,742 --> 00:03:45,910
Now, get out of here.

81
00:03:51,316 --> 00:03:52,650
What are you doing?

82
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:55,820
<i>Singin' in the Rain</i>.

83
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:57,955
We were together sixteen years.
You think I don't remember

84
00:03:58,023 --> 00:04:00,324
what movie makes you feel
better when you're sick?

85
00:04:00,392 --> 00:04:02,026
<i>Then they're not good,
so don't eat those.</i>

86
00:04:02,094 --> 00:04:03,094
<i>Just go ahead and discard those.</i>

87
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:05,996
<i>And that is how you steam clams.</i>

88
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,796
I'm shaking.

89
00:04:09,797 --> 00:04:11,635
And it's either from
low blood sugar or rage.

90
00:04:11,703 --> 00:04:13,003
I knew it was only a matter of time

91
00:04:13,071 --> 00:04:15,172
before Rachel tried to
take over the Glee Club.

92
00:04:17,972 --> 00:04:21,612
Class, in Mr. Schuester's absence,
I'd like to go around and ask everyone

93
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,502
what solos they'd like to
hear me perform at sectionals.

94
00:04:24,503 --> 00:04:25,950
All right, you know what?
Let me at her!

95
00:04:28,053 --> 00:04:29,954
We'll forget all about
it tonight at bowling.

96
00:04:30,021 --> 00:04:30,988
I can't.

97
00:04:31,056 --> 00:04:32,690
Blaine asked me to hang out.

98
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,170
I've been looking forward to it all week.

99
00:04:36,094 --> 00:04:37,728
Wait.
Are you two going out?

100
00:04:37,796 --> 00:04:39,330
Because I think you need to come clean.

101
00:04:39,397 --> 00:04:40,731
What? No.

102
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:43,513
I don't want another
Jessie/Rachel traitor scenario to overcome.

103
00:04:43,869 --> 00:04:45,069
Please, Mercedes. Mum's the word.

104
00:04:45,137 --> 00:04:46,637
We'd be happy for you.

105
00:04:46,705 --> 00:04:48,572
I mean,
we know how lonely you've been.

106
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,840
All right, we just hang out.

107
00:04:49,908 --> 00:04:51,575
Nothing about Glee Club
even ever comes up.

108
00:04:51,643 --> 00:04:53,844
It's just nice to have someone to talk to.

109
00:04:53,912 --> 00:04:57,381
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I mean, someone like me.

110
00:04:58,301 --> 00:04:59,653
But I promise to make it up to you.

111
00:04:59,654 --> 00:05:00,768
We'll hang out Friday night.

112
00:05:10,929 --> 00:05:12,763
Excuse you.

113
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:17,001
Whoa, whoa.
A couple more.

114
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:18,302
Thanks.

115
00:05:18,905 --> 00:05:22,139
So what are we going to do about
Glee Club while Mr. Shue is sick?

116
00:05:22,207 --> 00:05:23,474
I have an idea.

117
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:25,309
Have you met the new Spanish teacher?

118
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,480
<i>It's not easy being a substitute teacher.</i>

119
00:05:29,548 --> 00:05:31,248
<i>Kids feel like they get the day off.</i>

120
00:05:31,316 --> 00:05:34,084
<i>They'll goof off, egg your car, cut class,</i>

121
00:05:34,152 --> 00:05:35,786
<i>break into your car, throw spitballs,</i>

122
00:05:35,854 --> 00:05:37,555
<i>put an alligator in your car...</i>

123
00:05:37,622 --> 00:05:39,286
<i>And I don't even have a nice car.</i>

124
00:05:44,391 --> 00:05:46,541
<i>So I try to relate to the kids,</i>

125
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:49,034
<i>listen to what they have to say,
make it fun for them.</i>

126
00:05:52,707 --> 00:05:55,139
<i>Lindsay Lohan es bien loca, ¿no?</i>

127
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,813
<i>Because I'm the cure for the common class.</i>

128
00:06:08,453 --> 00:06:10,387
Excuse me, Miss Holliday?
A word?

129
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,662
I understand that you are subbing
for Mr. Schuester's Spanish class,

130
00:06:24,663 --> 00:06:27,076
and I was wondering if you
might not want to take over

131
00:06:27,077 --> 00:06:28,488
his Glee Club duties, as well.

132
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:30,908
What makes you think I know
the first thing about Glee Club?

133
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:33,177
You subbed for my English class last week.

134
00:06:33,245 --> 00:06:34,912
And you were extraordinary.

135
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:43,921

'Cause this is trippy.

142
00:07:01,673 --> 00:07:03,407
You smell homeless, Brett.

143
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:05,204
Homeless.

144
00:07:05,205 --> 00:07:07,244
Miss Holliday, we are floundering.

145
00:07:07,312 --> 00:07:08,445
Won't you please take over Glee Club?

146
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:10,648
I thought you'd never ask.

147
00:07:10,715 --> 00:07:12,216
Yay!

148
00:07:12,284 --> 00:07:13,717
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

149
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,702
Dude, what are you doing?

150
00:07:18,703 --> 00:07:21,027
Kurt got us a substitute,
so I'm buttering the floor.

151
00:07:21,028 --> 00:07:22,760
But sectionals is, like,
two weeks from now.

152
00:07:22,827 --> 00:07:25,496
Hey, Gigantor.
We're all gonna swap names, yo.

153
00:07:25,563 --> 00:07:28,265
Um, did I hear something
about a substitute?

154
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,633
Yes! It works!

155
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:34,271
Well, at least I didn't
fall and break my talent.

156
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:36,273
I'm fine.

157
00:07:41,313 --> 00:07:42,646
Oh, what the hell?

158
00:07:42,714 --> 00:07:44,448
<i>Hola, clase.</i>

159
00:07:44,516 --> 00:07:47,785
Nothing says "<i>bienvenidos</i>"
quite like a buttered floor.

160
00:07:49,354 --> 00:07:50,888
Let's start with some introductions.

161
00:07:50,955 --> 00:07:53,290
My name is Holly Holliday.

162
00:07:53,358 --> 00:07:55,025
What's yours?
Go.

163
00:07:55,093 --> 00:07:57,661
I'm Finn Hudson.
I'm quarterback of the football team.

164
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:00,130
I'm Rachel Berry,
his loud, loud girlfriend.

165
00:08:00,198 --> 00:08:02,733
I'm Mike Chang.

166
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:03,761
Those aren't your names.

167
00:08:03,762 --> 00:08:05,402
- You know why I know that?
- You're psychic?

168
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,205
I know this because I recently watched

169
00:08:07,206 --> 00:08:09,640
a video of you guys
performing at regionals,

170
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,542
where you came in last.

171
00:08:11,609 --> 00:08:14,311
Maybe it's because the songs
were about thirty years old, but...

172
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:15,346
Those songs are classics.

173
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:16,947
Those songs are amazing.

174
00:08:17,015 --> 00:08:20,926
But they sounded like somebody
else's favorite songs. Not yours.

175
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:22,860
- Just sayin'.
- She speaks the truth.

176
00:08:22,861 --> 00:08:25,789
I'm not your average,
run-of-the-mill substitute teacher.

177
00:08:25,857 --> 00:08:29,907
I want you guys to do things
that you want to do.

178
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:34,137
I want you to have fun in our fabulous
but fleeting time together.

179
00:08:34,332 --> 00:08:35,466
What do you say we have
class outside today?

180
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:37,167
It's raining outside.

181
00:08:37,235 --> 00:08:38,802
Well, then let's take a
field trip to Taco Bell.

182
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,404
Oh, yeah!

183
00:08:40,472 --> 00:08:43,214
Should we toke up some
medical-grade marijuana?

184
00:08:43,215 --> 00:08:44,694
I wish.

185
00:08:44,695 --> 00:08:45,698
Yes!

186
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:47,704
- It's really hard not to like this woman.
- Okay...

187
00:08:47,705 --> 00:08:50,080
No.
We can't just goof off all day.

188
00:08:50,148 --> 00:08:52,316
We have to write a set
list for sectionals.

189
00:08:52,384 --> 00:08:54,837
You're right.
What songs would you like to do?

190
00:08:56,921 --> 00:08:59,935
Oh. Don't get asked that
question much, do we?

191
00:08:59,936 --> 00:09:01,601
Ms. Holliday is right.

192
00:09:01,602 --> 00:09:03,214
Mr. Schuester's set
list sometimes seems like

193
00:09:03,215 --> 00:09:04,668
he hasn't listened to
the radio since the '80s.

194
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,788
He never listens to what I have to say.

195
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:09,867
Mr. Shue, can we do that new
Cee-Lo song, "Forget You"?

196
00:09:09,934 --> 00:09:11,902
Uh, no.
Come on, guys,

197
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,171
there's got to be a Journey
song we haven't done yet.

198
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:15,883
Cee-Lo!

199
00:09:15,884 --> 00:09:17,449
That's what I'm talking about.

200
00:09:18,877 --> 00:09:21,574
Okay, excuse me?
What would you know about Cee-Lo?

201
00:09:21,575 --> 00:09:22,791
'Cause you're like, 40.

202
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:24,727
Top 40, sweet cheeks.

203
00:09:24,728 --> 00:09:25,880

This is not up for discussion, fellas.

257
00:12:02,018 --> 00:12:05,883
You do not spray athlete's foot medicine

258
00:12:05,884 --> 00:12:09,213
in your teammates' eyes.
Come on!

259
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,935
Can I help you, Sue?

260
00:12:12,936 --> 00:12:15,269
Principal Sue,
and I'm here to inform you

261
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,300
that effective 4:00 P.M. today...

262
00:12:18,157 --> 00:12:21,479
The football team is
officially... disbanded.

263
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,353
Well, if you're cutting the football team,

264
00:12:23,354 --> 00:12:25,554
who are your Cheerios! going to cheer for?

265
00:12:30,193 --> 00:12:33,762
I will get back to you
on all of this later.

266
00:12:41,542 --> 00:12:42,284
No.

267
00:12:42,285 --> 00:12:44,201
<i>Humiliation.</i>

<i>less than 24 hours after my

270
00:12:49,846 --> 00:12:52,268
<i>in the school with sharp
poles was thwarted...</i>

271
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:55,097
<i>A resounding defeat in
my war against sitting.</i>

272
00:12:55,611 --> 00:12:57,529
<i>Reality is, I'm a champion,</i>

273
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:01,186

274
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,419
<i>I need a cause.</i>

275
00:13:08,772 --> 00:13:10,062
<i>That's it.</i>

276
00:13:11,134 --> 00:13:13,836
Becky, get your fanny in here,
and bring your pad.

277
00:13:13,904 --> 00:13:15,346
Yes, Coach?

278
00:13:15,347 --> 00:13:16,831
Becky, take a memo.

279
00:13:17,574 --> 00:13:21,277
- I'm banning po-tater tots.
- Outstanding.

280

I don't understand who gave her
the authority to take over Glee Club.

328
00:16:14,048 --> 00:16:17,877
- What?
- I was doing a fine job of
running Glee in your absence,

329
00:16:17,878 --> 00:16:20,456
and then Kurt, jealous,
asked her to take over.

330
00:16:20,523 --> 00:16:22,725
I'm not too worried about it, Rachel.

331
00:16:25,261 --> 00:16:27,318
I really appreciate your concern, but...

332
00:16:28,576 --> 00:16:30,966

coming in and usurping me.

00:16:31,034 --> 00:16:32,668

00:16:32,736 --> 00:16:34,503

336
00:16:35,681 --> 00:16:37,800
is having someone fun at this school.

Mm. We're back. Okay.

338
00:16:41,052 --> 00:16:43,127

00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:44,864

00:16:46,904 --> 00:16:48,427
<i>Hoarders</i> and red wine.

341
00:16:48,428 --> 00:16:50,630
♪ I'm buzzed! ♪

342
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,529
You have to get well, Mr. Schuester,

343
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,872
because every day
you're here, she's there,

344
00:16:55,873 --> 00:16:57,121
and it becomes more and more likely

345
00:16:57,122 --> 00:16:58,594
that she's going to start
running the Glee Club,

346
00:16:58,595 --> 00:17:00,548
and you're going to become the substitute.

347
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:11,507
Oh, we have to get there early on Friday.

348
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:12,641
It's league night for little people,

349
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:14,743
and they'll buy up all the small
shoes if they get there first.

350
00:17:14,811 --> 00:17:15,922
Oh, I totally forgot.

351
00:17:15,923 --> 00:17:18,280
Greg Evigan is starring in
rent at the community playhouse,

352
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:19,662
and Blaine got us tickets.

353
00:17:20,222 --> 00:17:22,004
"Us" as in all of us?

354
00:17:22,434 --> 00:17:24,253
I think he could only score two.

355
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,978
Wait. Where do you think
you're going with those?

356
00:17:33,979 --> 00:17:35,356
Principal Sue banned the tots.

357
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,027
She can't do that!

358
00:17:37,028 --> 00:17:38,814
They look like deep-fried deer poop.

359
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,076
Take it up with principal Sue.

360
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:44,682
We'll get you some-some...

361
00:17:44,683 --> 00:17:45,872
Ugh! Okay.

362
00:17:48,418 --> 00:17:49,681
Why did you take away our tots?

363
00:17:49,682 --> 00:17:51,285
You don't have an appointment.

364
00:17:53,081 --> 00:17:54,146
Jackee,

365
00:17:54,147 --> 00:17:57,443
I am like my idol,
Richard Millhouse Nixon.

366
00:17:57,526 --> 00:18:00,422
Regarded in his time as
petty, corrupt and venal,

367
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:03,992
he actually always had the best
interests of his people in mind.

368
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,762
And also like Richard Nixon,
I'm obliged to inform you

369
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,597
that this conversation is being recorded.

370
00:18:08,665 --> 00:18:10,666
I want my tots.

371
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:13,469
Nutrition is abysmal at this school.

372
00:18:14,002 --> 00:18:14,880
You know what this is?

373
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:16,641
Toilet brush. It's broccoli.

374
00:18:16,642 --> 00:18:19,033
When I showed this to Brittany
earlier, she began to whimper,

375
00:18:19,034 --> 00:18:22,704
thinking I had cut down a small tree
where a family of gummy bears lived.

376
00:18:23,016 --> 00:18:25,447
I am declaring a war on junk food.

377
00:18:25,515 --> 00:18:27,683
I'm getting my tots back.

378
00:18:29,552 --> 00:18:31,220
Becky, that can't happen again.

379
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,248
Keep 'em out.

380
00:18:33,249 --> 00:18:34,944
Roger that. Thank you, coach.

381
00:18:37,677 --> 00:18:39,799
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hello, miss Holliday.

382
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,508
I'd like you to know

383
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:42,531
that I have a very severe
bruise on my right buttocks

384
00:18:42,532 --> 00:18:44,741
from your game of gangsta
rap musical chairs.

385
00:18:44,742 --> 00:18:47,388
I'll be going on record with
the school nurse later today.

386
00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:49,663
Rachel, you suck.

387
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:52,495
Oh, my God, you're like a total drag.

388
00:18:52,496 --> 00:18:54,546
Has anyone ever told you that? I have.

389
00:18:54,547 --> 00:18:55,944
Oh, Puckerman, here are the answers

390
00:18:55,945 --> 00:18:58,000
to the pop quiz I'll be
giving in Spanish class later.

391
00:18:58,001 --> 00:18:59,856
It is so boring in there.

392
00:18:59,857 --> 00:19:00,484
Thanks, miss h.

393
00:19:00,485 --> 00:19:01,560
Righteous.

394
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,629
You know what? Maybe I
should be more like you.

395
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,123
All fun, and just forget
about the consequences.

396
00:19:08,124 --> 00:19:09,562
Well, frankly, yes, you should.

397
00:19:09,563 --> 00:19:10,791
I mean, at least sometimes.

398
00:19:10,792 --> 00:19:12,456
When was the last time
that you did something

399
00:19:12,457 --> 00:19:14,457
just because you thought
it would be a blast?

400
00:19:14,838 --> 00:19:16,126
Take Glee Club.

401
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,537
I mean, you have all these great ideas.

402
00:19:18,538 --> 00:19:20,562
When is the last time you
actually did one of them?

403
00:19:20,563 --> 00:19:23,504
Mr. Shue can be a little
tight-fisted with song selection, but

404
00:19:23,505 --> 00:19:25,894
I would like to do something
a little bit more upbeat

405
00:19:25,895 --> 00:19:27,977
and glamorous with a good dance beat.

406
00:19:27,978 --> 00:19:30,582
Sounds reasonable to me. Have you asked?

407
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,273
Mr. Shuster, I want to
do more of an upbeat,

408
00:19:33,274 --> 00:19:35,472
glamorous song with a
really good dance beat.

409
00:19:35,473 --> 00:19:37,745
No, but I have good news.

410
00:19:37,903 --> 00:19:40,051
I found a journey song
we haven't done yet.

411
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,420
Rachel, I used to be just like you,

412
00:19:42,421 --> 00:19:45,212
trying to get everything so
right, hanging on so tight.

413
00:19:45,338 --> 00:19:46,266
What happened?

414
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,671
I got punched in the face. Anyway,

415
00:19:48,672 --> 00:19:49,899
why don't you let me know the name

416
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,603
of this upbeat, glamorous
song with the nice dance beat,

417
00:19:52,604 --> 00:19:56,057
because, hot stuff, you
are doing it in Glee Club.

418
00:19:56,058 --> 00:19:58,824
I kind of need a partner
to do the song I wanted.

419
00:19:58,825 --> 00:20:00,723
I thought you'd never ask.

420
00:20:00,892 --> 00:20:02,419
That's kind of my catch phrase.

421
00:20:04,428 --> 00:20:05,631
So...

422
00:20:06,064 --> 00:20:07,300
What meds are you on?

423
00:20:07,778 --> 00:20:12,059
Um, antidepressants and
anti-anxiety when I need them.

424
00:20:15,585 --> 00:20:16,671
Are you happy?

425
00:20:17,219 --> 00:20:18,608
You know, I think I feel like

426
00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:20,554
for the first time maybe I could be happy.

427
00:20:21,746 --> 00:20:22,948
How about you?

428
00:20:23,824 --> 00:20:24,947
Happy? Yeah.

429
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:28,278
If I'm gonna be honest,

430
00:20:28,742 --> 00:20:29,944
no.

431
00:20:31,068 --> 00:20:33,589
I still feel like I'm
searching for something.

432
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,744
Here. Some more.

433
00:20:37,054 --> 00:20:38,058
There...

434
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:39,394
Thanks, Terri.

435
00:20:41,294 --> 00:20:42,660
Baby likes his soup.

436
00:20:42,661 --> 00:20:43,861
Oh.

437
00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:46,347
You know, I remember something
else that baby loves a lot.

438
00:20:51,402 --> 00:20:52,368
Okay.

439
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,899
Rubbing menthol.

440
00:21:00,247 --> 00:21:02,449
I love that stuff. I know you do.

441
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,972
Take your shirt off, lie
on your stomach. Come on.

442
00:21:06,363 --> 00:21:07,649
What? I'm not going to kill you.

443
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,817
It'll make you feel better. All right.

444
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:14,708
Here.

445
00:21:34,705 --> 00:21:35,843
Don't.

446
00:21:36,136 --> 00:21:37,230
Don't.

447
00:21:37,592 --> 00:21:39,012
I don't want to get you sick.

448
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,972
I don't care.

449
00:21:55,202 --> 00:21:56,693
Look at this crap.

450
00:21:56,694 --> 00:21:57,971
Foam fish sticks?

451
00:21:58,146 --> 00:22:00,848
Principal Sylvester's only
serving predigested food now

452
00:22:00,915 --> 00:22:02,282
to give us more energy.

453
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,051
I mean, do I look like a damn baby bird?

454
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:05,886
Don't fret your culinary disappointments.

455
00:22:05,954 --> 00:22:07,121
I come bearing gifts.

456
00:22:07,188 --> 00:22:08,288
You brought tots?

457
00:22:08,356 --> 00:22:09,823
Better. I've set you up on a date.

458
00:22:09,891 --> 00:22:11,391
I get it.

459
00:22:11,459 --> 00:22:12,626
My new budding friendship with Blaine

460
00:22:12,694 --> 00:22:14,027
is making you feel left out,

461
00:22:14,095 --> 00:22:15,662
jealous. Who's the guy?

462
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,390
Anthony Rashad.

463
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:22,503
Why him?

464
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,004
No reason.

465
00:22:24,072 --> 00:22:25,844
Oh, so it has nothing to do
with the fact that he's one of

466
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,714
the five black guys at this school?

467
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:30,817
Uh, no, he is a wide
receiver on the football team,

468
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:33,013
he is very good-looking,

469
00:22:33,081 --> 00:22:35,616
and he is a member of
the black student union.

470
00:22:35,683 --> 00:22:37,017
Any non-black activities?

471
00:22:37,085 --> 00:22:39,820
I don't know...
My Google search was a little...

472
00:22:39,888 --> 00:22:40,854
I can't take this anymore.

473
00:22:40,922 --> 00:22:42,890
Mercedes, trust me, love is just

474
00:22:42,957 --> 00:22:45,659
around the corner. What's up, homo?

475
00:22:45,727 --> 00:22:47,895
That's not what I'm talking about.

476
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,271
Tots!

477
00:22:57,338 --> 00:22:58,572
Oh, my God!

478
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,507
Tots! Tots! Tots!

479
00:23:00,575 --> 00:23:02,042
Tots! Tots! Tots!

480
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,610
Tots! Tots!

481
00:23:03,678 --> 00:23:06,680
Tots! Tots! Tots! Tots! Tots! Tots!

482
00:23:06,748 --> 00:23:09,416

Hey, buddy,

499
00:25:36,698 --> 00:25:38,332
You look terrible...
You should be home in bed.

500
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:39,866
There's no reason for you to be here.

501
00:25:39,934 --> 00:25:41,635
Well, the kids need me.

502
00:25:41,703 --> 00:25:44,171
No, literally, there's no
reason for you to be here.

503
00:25:44,238 --> 00:25:46,974
The kids prefer the
substitute, and so do I.

504
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:48,542
I got to be honest with you, Will.

505
00:25:48,609 --> 00:25:50,477
A lot of it's the hair thing.

506
00:25:50,545 --> 00:25:53,146
In fact, right now I'm
tempted to sell your scalp

507
00:25:53,214 --> 00:25:56,183
on the black market as a tiny,
full-length shearling coat

508
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,353
for only the most fashionable
of premature babies.

509
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:03,390
Oh... I long for the day when Figgins
gets better and comes back.

510
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:05,158
Well, that's not gonna happen.

511
00:26:05,226 --> 00:26:06,793
The school board has been just flooded

512
00:26:06,861 --> 00:26:09,963
with e-mails from parents
thrilled with my tough stance

513
00:26:10,031 --> 00:26:11,565
on healthy teen lunches.

514
00:26:11,632 --> 00:26:13,300
Figgins has been fired,

515
00:26:13,368 --> 00:26:15,635
and I've been formally
offered the position.

516
00:26:15,703 --> 00:26:17,404
So, why don't you go home,

517
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,640
rest, watch some tv, die.

518
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:23,010
It doesn't matter...
'Cause you know what?

519
00:26:23,077 --> 00:26:26,480
As my first official act
as full-time principal,

520
00:26:26,547 --> 00:26:28,048
you are fired.

521
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:37,365
Drunk people who get married
to someone just saying that

522
00:26:37,366 --> 00:26:39,312
they met an hour ago by
an Elvis impersonator...

523
00:26:39,313 --> 00:26:40,714
I mean, that's the
bigger insult to marriage

524
00:26:40,715 --> 00:26:42,587
than two gay guys getting
hitched. Totally. It's, like,

525
00:26:42,588 --> 00:26:45,426
if marriage is so sacred, they
should just outlaw divorce.

526
00:26:45,427 --> 00:26:46,643
Right? Right. Right.

527
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:47,721
What do you think, Mercedes?

528
00:26:47,722 --> 00:26:49,416
Oh, about, uh, "don't ask, don't tell".

529
00:26:49,417 --> 00:26:51,045
No, we're on prop 8 now.

530
00:26:51,244 --> 00:26:52,911
Totally for it.

531
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:53,912
Against it.

532
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,213
Right.

533
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:56,578
I'm sorry, I kind of just blanked out.

534
00:26:56,579 --> 00:26:58,180
Oh, don't apologize...
We should talk about stuff

535
00:26:58,181 --> 00:26:59,751
that you're interested in, too.

536
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:00,554
I know...
Let's play a game.

537
00:27:00,555 --> 00:27:01,606
Okay, on the count of three,

538
00:27:01,607 --> 00:27:03,788
name your favorite 2010 vogue cover.

539
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:06,458
Okay, ready?
One, two, three...

540
00:27:06,526 --> 00:27:08,560
Marion Cotillard. Yes!
Marion Cotillard. Oh, my God, stop it!

541
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:09,928
Yes, I know. She's amazing!

542
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:11,396
Amazing! Amazing!

543
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,198
Amazing.
Gay!

544
00:27:13,266 --> 00:27:14,833
Gay! Gay. Gay, gay, gay.

545
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:16,668
Gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay.

546
00:27:16,736 --> 00:27:19,738
Oh, my gosh, I open my mouth
and a little purse falls out!

547
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:20,605
That's so gay.

548
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:21,973
How did that get in there?

549
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:22,941
Mercedes?

550
00:27:24,571 --> 00:27:26,684
Mercedes?
I was just talking

551
00:27:26,685 --> 00:27:29,307
about the Buckeyes...
I'm a college football fan.

552
00:27:29,308 --> 00:27:30,326
I like sports, too, you know.

553
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:32,447
Oh, way to break the stereotype.

554
00:27:32,515 --> 00:27:35,270
Excuse me. I know it's not on your menu,

555
00:27:35,271 --> 00:27:36,685
but I was wondering if you guys had...

556
00:27:36,752 --> 00:27:38,086
You want some tots?

557
00:27:38,154 --> 00:27:40,121
You kids must go to McKinley.

558
00:27:41,324 --> 00:27:44,526
So, what were we talking about?

559
00:27:44,593 --> 00:27:47,285
Has anyone read Patti Lupone's new book?

560
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:53,554
I'm kidding. Of course
I have. You scared me

561
00:27:53,654 --> 00:27:54,226
so much there.

562
00:27:54,227 --> 00:27:55,205
I know, I was...

563
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,175
Nice job, band dudes.

564
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:01,044
It feels like the sun is shining in here.

565
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:02,713
And the body's still warm.

566
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,115
Hi. I'm Will Schuester,

567
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,484
and this is my choir room.

568
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,453
I'm sorry we had to meet like this.

569
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,437
The kids really love you.
You must be a great teacher.

570
00:28:12,537 --> 00:28:14,409
You don't believe that...
If you did,

571
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,994
you wouldn't have taken my job so easily.

572
00:28:16,018 --> 00:28:17,586
Guys, you want to take five?

573
00:28:19,355 --> 00:28:21,490
Okay, you want to have this
conversation, let's have it.

574
00:28:21,557 --> 00:28:23,825
You're a substitute...
Of course you can...

575
00:28:23,893 --> 00:28:26,261
Paint murals and let the
kids sing whatever they want.

576
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:28,130
You're never around when they have to deal

577
00:28:28,197 --> 00:28:29,698
with the hangover of all that fun.

578
00:28:29,766 --> 00:28:32,868
16% of all high school
students dropped out last year.

579
00:28:32,935 --> 00:28:35,670
We can't just expect them
to sit up and pay attention.

580
00:28:35,738 --> 00:28:37,139
These kids feel special.

581
00:28:37,206 --> 00:28:39,908
They have a voice, and
if we don't listen to it,

582
00:28:39,976 --> 00:28:41,309
they just tune us out.

583
00:28:41,377 --> 00:28:43,078
I give my kids a voice.

584
00:28:43,146 --> 00:28:44,913
I just don't let it run free.

585
00:28:44,981 --> 00:28:46,882
I'm the teacher...
It's my job to know

586
00:28:46,949 --> 00:28:49,351
more than they do. Right,
but you don't know more

587
00:28:49,419 --> 00:28:51,753
about what they care about
the most... Themselves.

588
00:28:51,821 --> 00:28:53,388
These kids get bored,

589
00:28:53,456 --> 00:28:55,023
they change their Facebook status.

590
00:28:55,091 --> 00:28:57,511
They're entitled to have
all of these emotions,

591
00:28:57,512 --> 00:28:58,493
and not only that, they're entitled

592
00:28:58,561 --> 00:29:00,228
for the world to care about them.

593
00:29:00,296 --> 00:29:01,763
That's what this generation is about.

594
00:29:01,831 --> 00:29:04,032
A great teacher is
supposed to show them that

595
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,901
there are other points
of view besides their own.

596
00:29:05,968 --> 00:29:07,602
Okay, fine. What do you do when

597
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,938
a kid does something
really great in your class?

598
00:29:10,006 --> 00:29:12,974
Praise them. I tweet them
about it right there and then,

599
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:15,798
and for those 30 seconds, I know
that that kid has a connection

600
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:17,219
with me.

601
00:29:20,983 --> 00:29:23,840
Look, it's... a terrible economy,

602
00:29:23,841 --> 00:29:26,494
and good teaching jobs
are hard enough to get,

603
00:29:26,495 --> 00:29:27,923
let alone one in the arts.

604
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,658
I just...

605
00:29:29,725 --> 00:29:33,762
I'm sorry, but I... I can't
turn this opportunity down.

606
00:29:44,006 --> 00:29:47,075
You want to tell Ms.
Holliday why we're here?

607
00:29:47,143 --> 00:29:49,778
Remember when I asked
to be excused from class?

608
00:29:49,846 --> 00:29:51,813
May I be excused? I'm
gonna go shove some tots

609
00:29:51,881 --> 00:29:53,215
up the tailpipe of coach Sylvester's car.

610
00:29:53,282 --> 00:29:55,250
Sure!

611
00:29:55,318 --> 00:29:57,953
I told her not to touch my tots.

612
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,517
You did $17,000 worth of damage.

613
00:30:02,461 --> 00:30:05,794
I drive a very rare and
desirable automobile, ladies.

614
00:30:05,862 --> 00:30:08,396
Prized by collectors
for its peerless grace

615
00:30:08,464 --> 00:30:10,765
among vintage European sports cars,

616
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:13,201
one out of seven in existence.

617
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,403
The 1979 Lecar.

618
00:30:15,471 --> 00:30:16,872
You know how many hours it took

619
00:30:16,939 --> 00:30:19,307
to find a mechanic who
even knew what a Lecar was?

620
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:20,775
She's your student.

621
00:30:20,843 --> 00:30:23,178
I would love to hear what
you suggest as punishment.

622
00:30:23,246 --> 00:30:26,381
I was gonna suggest clapping erasers,

623
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:29,951
but you guys are mostly
dry-erase here, so...

624
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:32,521
You know what you might
not find so funny, Mercedes,

625
00:30:32,588 --> 00:30:34,289
is that tampering with
an automobile's exhaust

626
00:30:34,357 --> 00:30:35,624
is a felony.

627
00:30:35,691 --> 00:30:37,626
And you can rest assured that I

628
00:30:37,693 --> 00:30:40,829
and my attorney, Gloria Allred,
will be pressing charges.

629
00:30:40,897 --> 00:30:42,264
So...

630
00:30:42,331 --> 00:30:44,332
Am I going to jail, or...

631
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,667
Undetermined. Great.

632
00:30:45,735 --> 00:30:47,736
Get the hell out of my office.

633
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:56,077
You have absolutely no idea
what you're doing, do you?

634
00:30:57,246 --> 00:30:59,681
No. Not really.

635
00:30:59,749 --> 00:31:01,116
By the way, berets are out.

636
00:31:04,623 --> 00:31:06,924
Sorry for just coming over like this.

637
00:31:06,992 --> 00:31:09,660
I wanted to do this in person.

638
00:31:09,728 --> 00:31:12,063
Plus, I heard you have expensive beer.

639
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:13,764
I'm glad you did. And I do.

640
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:17,235
Look, I was out of line before...

641
00:31:17,302 --> 00:31:19,370
you have every right to
teach however you want.

642
00:31:19,438 --> 00:31:21,572
And the fact is, the
kids clearly love you.

643
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,407
I'm a terrible teacher.

644
00:31:23,475 --> 00:31:25,877
Don't argue with me...
I know I am.

645
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:29,480
Today...

646
00:31:29,548 --> 00:31:31,649
Mercedes got in trouble

647
00:31:31,717 --> 00:31:34,185
for shoving tots up Sue
Sylvester's tailpipe,

648
00:31:34,253 --> 00:31:36,521
and we were sitting in Sue's office,

649
00:31:36,588 --> 00:31:38,923
and Mercedes was looking at me like...

650
00:31:38,991 --> 00:31:41,159
And I just was totally lost.

651
00:31:41,226 --> 00:31:43,561
What did... What did Sue do to her?
Whatever. I don't know.

652
00:31:43,629 --> 00:31:45,329
She, like, suspended her or whatever.

653
00:31:45,397 --> 00:31:47,064
Oh! See?

654
00:31:47,132 --> 00:31:49,066
God, I do that every time!

655
00:31:49,134 --> 00:31:52,203
As soon as things get serious, I retreat.

656
00:31:52,271 --> 00:31:56,007
God, I... I didn't used
to be like this, you know?

657
00:31:56,074 --> 00:31:59,143
I...I... I was...
More like you.

658
00:31:59,211 --> 00:32:01,212
Spaulding High School, ten years ago.

659
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,613
Good morning, class.

660
00:32:02,681 --> 00:32:04,282
I was subbing for a math teacher.

661
00:32:04,349 --> 00:32:06,284
The syllabus says that
you're on algorithms,

662
00:32:06,351 --> 00:32:08,219
so let's start with some easy ones.

663
00:32:08,287 --> 00:32:09,954
Let's start with you kissing my ass!

664
00:32:10,022 --> 00:32:11,689
Her name was cameo.

665
00:32:11,757 --> 00:32:13,691
She was like an attractive biggie smalls.

666
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:15,626
Okay, Miss... Cameo.

667
00:32:15,694 --> 00:32:17,962
Miss Cameo, do you find that algorithms

668
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:20,131
are hard for you to understand?

669
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:21,599
Do you find my fist hard to understand?

670
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:23,334
I have some really great tricks

671
00:32:23,402 --> 00:32:25,136
that make them very easy to learn.

672
00:32:25,204 --> 00:32:27,605
Tricks? What are you, some
type of magician substitute?

673
00:32:27,673 --> 00:32:28,539
I'm a Christian,

674
00:32:28,607 --> 00:32:30,441
and that devil magic stuff

675
00:32:30,509 --> 00:32:31,542
offends me!

676
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:32,710
Cameo!

677
00:32:32,778 --> 00:32:34,912
I woke up in an empty classroom.

678
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,682
They'd stolen my air Jordans.

679
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:40,751
From that moment, I realized
I got to keep things moving,

680
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:42,787
I got to keep it mellow and fun.

681
00:32:42,854 --> 00:32:44,455
Yeah, to keep from
getting your butt kicked.

682
00:32:44,523 --> 00:32:46,591
And I do, in all ways.

683
00:32:46,658 --> 00:32:49,727
I never sign more than
a month-to-month lease.

684
00:32:49,795 --> 00:32:51,929
I only eat off paper plates.

685
00:32:51,997 --> 00:32:54,098
I live on one-night stands.

686
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:55,233
Last year a guy

687
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,969
asked me to marry him; I moved.

688
00:32:59,972 --> 00:33:03,207
Sounds... lonely.

689
00:33:05,744 --> 00:33:07,678
Yeah.

690
00:33:07,746 --> 00:33:10,248
Well... It works for me.

691
00:33:12,884 --> 00:33:14,719
But it doesn't work for those kids.

692
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:15,987
I'm resigning.

693
00:33:20,192 --> 00:33:21,726
Wow, Will.

694
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:23,494
I mean, wow. What are you doing here?

695
00:33:23,562 --> 00:33:24,662
You should've called.

696
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,364
I brought you some more soup.

697
00:33:26,431 --> 00:33:27,665
But I guess baby's feeling

698
00:33:27,733 --> 00:33:29,200
a lot better if he's healthy enough

699
00:33:29,268 --> 00:33:31,402
to have a beer with a friend!

700
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,004
No, no. I...

701
00:33:33,071 --> 00:33:35,039
Hi. I'm-I'm holly Holliday.

702
00:33:35,107 --> 00:33:37,575
Are you a porn star or a drag queen?

703
00:33:37,643 --> 00:33:39,243
I'm Terri Schuester, Will's wife.

704
00:33:39,311 --> 00:33:40,511
Wow.

705
00:33:40,579 --> 00:33:42,280
Your wife's kind of a bitch.

706
00:33:42,347 --> 00:33:43,681
She's my ex-wife.

707
00:33:43,749 --> 00:33:45,750
And I have no idea what she's doing here.

708
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:47,418
Do I have to remind you what went on here?

709
00:33:47,486 --> 00:33:48,986
Can we talk about this another time?

710
00:33:49,054 --> 00:33:50,688
Why, 'cause this is embarrassing
in front of your new girlfriend?

711
00:33:50,756 --> 00:33:52,757
Where has she been the past two days, huh?

712
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:54,458
Okay, I'm just gonna go home.

713
00:33:54,526 --> 00:33:56,193
No.

714
00:33:56,261 --> 00:33:57,862
I'm sorry, Terri.

715
00:33:57,929 --> 00:33:59,497
Last night was a mistake.

716
00:33:59,564 --> 00:34:01,866
I knew it as soon as it happened.

717
00:34:01,933 --> 00:34:03,801
I was lonely and...

718
00:34:03,869 --> 00:34:05,369
You were there.

719
00:34:05,437 --> 00:34:07,371
I-I am sorry.

720
00:34:09,341 --> 00:34:11,175
No, I'm... Honey, I'm sorry.

721
00:34:11,243 --> 00:34:12,576
I just...

722
00:34:12,644 --> 00:34:14,478
I'm really out of control right now,

723
00:34:14,546 --> 00:34:16,881
and... I'm gonna come back.

724
00:34:16,948 --> 00:34:18,316
Okay?

725
00:34:18,383 --> 00:34:19,784
Terri. Yeah?

726
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:21,252
Don't.

727
00:34:22,587 --> 00:34:24,088
Don't come back.

728
00:34:24,156 --> 00:34:26,957
This is your last chance, Will.

729
00:34:28,393 --> 00:34:30,094
It's never gonna happen again.

730
00:34:30,162 --> 00:34:32,596
If I leave now, I'm never gonna come back.

731
00:34:34,733 --> 00:34:37,401
You're gonna regret this, Will.

732
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:40,071
I swear to God, you're gonna regret this.

733
00:34:44,476 --> 00:34:46,577
Are you okay?

734
00:34:46,645 --> 00:34:49,847
Tell me again about this
life with no consequences.

735
00:34:49,915 --> 00:34:51,582
It's kind of awesome.

736
00:34:54,682 --> 00:34:56,216
Psst!

737
00:34:56,814 --> 00:34:58,976
Look what I snuck in.

738
00:35:00,357 --> 00:35:02,083
My heart was racing.

739
00:35:02,516 --> 00:35:04,135
Are you out of your mind?!

740
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:05,837
After what you did to Sue's Lecar?

741
00:35:05,905 --> 00:35:06,964
You're gonna end up in prison!

742
00:35:06,965 --> 00:35:09,474
So? You know what they have in prison.

743
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:10,742
Tots.

744
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:13,378
I'm not breaking it off with Blaine.

745
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:14,613
I really like him.

746
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,896
You are substituting
food for love, Mercedes.

747
00:35:18,213 --> 00:35:19,180
And more importantly,

748
00:35:19,181 --> 00:35:21,637
you're substituting me for a boyfriend.

749
00:35:22,532 --> 00:35:24,493
Look at me. Two weeks ago,

750
00:35:24,494 --> 00:35:27,208
I thought there was no way I'd
ever find someone like Blaine.

751
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:28,437
And there he was.

752
00:35:28,505 --> 00:35:30,606
You will find somebody.

753
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:32,260
But until then,

754
00:35:32,328 --> 00:35:34,596
you just got to take care of yourself.

755
00:35:34,664 --> 00:35:37,098
And treat yourself with a little respect.

756
00:35:38,701 --> 00:35:40,235
You're right.

757
00:35:40,303 --> 00:35:42,337
I got to go.

758
00:35:42,405 --> 00:35:43,738
Where?

759
00:35:43,806 --> 00:35:46,308
I'm gonna go talk to that Anthony kid.

760
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:49,811
First time I saw him, I
thought he was kind of cute.

761
00:35:49,879 --> 00:35:52,080
Maybe we have a shot.

762
00:35:53,716 --> 00:35:55,350
Question for you.

763
00:35:55,418 --> 00:35:57,519
You tell anyone else what happened?

764
00:35:57,587 --> 00:36:00,021
How you-you kissed me?

765
00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:02,991
You kissed me, Karofsky, and I understand

766
00:36:03,059 --> 00:36:04,931
how hard this is for you to deal with,

767
00:36:04,932 --> 00:36:06,361
so no, I haven't told anyone.

768
00:36:06,429 --> 00:36:08,597
Good. You keep it that way.

769
00:36:08,664 --> 00:36:10,565
'Cause if you do,

770
00:36:10,633 --> 00:36:13,168
I'm gonna kill you.

771
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:26,547
Is is where I grovel to
try to get my job back.

772
00:36:26,548 --> 00:36:28,782
No groveling necessary, William.

773
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:31,018
I'm returning you to your position.

774
00:36:31,085 --> 00:36:33,687
You know, one of the marks
of a successful leader

775
00:36:33,755 --> 00:36:35,355
is appointing trusted lieutenants,

776
00:36:35,423 --> 00:36:38,824
and Ms. Holliday was
clearly not up to the job.

777
00:36:40,037 --> 00:36:42,205
You irritate me, William.

778
00:36:42,273 --> 00:36:45,575
You make the under-flaps
of my breasts burn,

779
00:36:45,643 --> 00:36:47,744
like when I used to rub
them with poison sumac.

780
00:36:47,811 --> 00:36:49,412
But your kids sure love you,

781
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,915
as evinced by the amount
of treacly blubbering

782
00:36:51,982 --> 00:36:54,117
I had to sit through.

783
00:36:54,185 --> 00:36:56,286
Mr. Shue's the only teacher
at this school who asks you

784
00:36:56,353 --> 00:36:58,288
how you're doing and actually
wants to hear an answer.

785
00:36:58,355 --> 00:36:59,956
Mr. Shue's the only teacher at this school

786
00:37:00,024 --> 00:37:01,558
that ever really touched me.

787
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:02,792
Besides Mr. Ryerson.

788
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,894
He taught me how to tie my shoelaces.

789
00:37:04,962 --> 00:37:06,596
I used to think that I was the best thing

790
00:37:06,664 --> 00:37:07,564
that happened to this school, but...

791
00:37:07,631 --> 00:37:09,399
I was wrong.

792
00:37:09,466 --> 00:37:11,367
Mr. Schuester is.

793
00:37:11,435 --> 00:37:13,703
Mr. Shue taught me the
second half of the alphabet.

794
00:37:13,771 --> 00:37:15,905
I stopped after "m" and "n."

795
00:37:15,973 --> 00:37:18,841
I felt they were too
similar and got frustrated.

796
00:37:18,909 --> 00:37:20,877
You know, William, one thing I learned

797
00:37:20,945 --> 00:37:22,412
in my time as president...

798
00:37:22,479 --> 00:37:24,914
Principal.
You can't force public opinion.

799
00:37:24,982 --> 00:37:26,916
I pardoned you.

800
00:37:26,984 --> 00:37:29,152
Sometimes you got to give
the inmates what they want.

801
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,054
You throw 'em a comb, and hope they stop

802
00:37:31,121 --> 00:37:33,523
beating each other long enough
to whittle it into a shiv.

803
00:37:35,693 --> 00:37:37,393
Well, I am relieved.

804
00:37:37,461 --> 00:37:39,362
I sort of thought I'd been replaced.

805
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:41,064
Aw, shut your gash, Nancy.

806
00:37:42,399 --> 00:37:43,187
And as a condition

807
00:37:43,188 --> 00:37:45,841
of my not pressing charges, your Glee Club

808
00:37:45,842 --> 00:37:48,471
will return my Lecar to mint condition.

809
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:49,606
I suggest selling yourself

810
00:37:49,673 --> 00:37:51,641
on craigslist under the heading

811
00:37:51,709 --> 00:37:53,776
of "men seeking men with butt-chins."

812
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,755
All right, all right,
thank you very much, guys.

813
00:38:05,823 --> 00:38:08,191
Please, please, sit down. Just...

814
00:38:08,259 --> 00:38:09,559
Thank you...

815
00:38:09,627 --> 00:38:12,128
For that and...
And for all the kind words

816
00:38:12,196 --> 00:38:13,663
you said about me to Sue.

817
00:38:15,266 --> 00:38:16,866
The feelings are mutual.

818
00:38:16,934 --> 00:38:18,635
Now, we got to get crackin', though.

819
00:38:18,702 --> 00:38:20,803
We lost a few days there,
and it's all gonna be

820
00:38:20,871 --> 00:38:22,505
about focus and hard work for the next

821
00:38:22,573 --> 00:38:24,574
couple of days. I guess
Ms. Holliday really is gone.

822
00:38:24,642 --> 00:38:26,743
I know you guys liked her,
and she was a lot of fun,

823
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:28,745
but she and I both agreed
that this is what was best.

824
00:38:28,812 --> 00:38:29,794
Don't get us wrong, Mr. Shue,

825
00:38:29,795 --> 00:38:31,014
we always wanted you as our teacher.

826
00:38:31,081 --> 00:38:32,849
She was just kind of a nice break.

827
00:38:32,916 --> 00:38:33,750
She did loosen us up.

828
00:38:33,751 --> 00:38:35,618
And she actually had
some good ideas for a sub.

829
00:38:35,686 --> 00:38:37,820
Yeah. I get it.

830
00:38:37,888 --> 00:38:39,589
And maybe we can, uh,
incorporate those...

831
00:38:39,657 --> 00:38:41,124
after sectionals.

832
00:38:41,191 --> 00:38:43,226
Now, when I'm sick,

833
00:38:43,294 --> 00:38:45,061
there is only one thing
that makes me feel better.

834
00:38:45,129 --> 00:38:46,496
Gin and juice.

835
00:38:46,563 --> 00:38:49,065
No. Singin' in the rain.

836
00:38:49,133 --> 00:38:50,466
I must've watched it, like,

837
00:38:50,534 --> 00:38:51,968
ten times over the past three days.

838
00:38:52,036 --> 00:38:53,555
It's actually what
inspired me to try this out

839
00:38:53,556 --> 00:38:55,805
as a contender for our
first song at sectionals.

840
00:38:55,873 --> 00:38:57,240
When is the song from?

841
00:38:57,308 --> 00:38:59,542
Well, the movie opened in 1952.

842
00:39:01,045 --> 00:39:02,679
But... But... But it's...
But it's really timeless.

843
00:39:06,917 --> 00:39:09,852
Mary Todd Lincoln in the house!

844
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,689
My husband was probably
gay, and I'm bipolar,

845
00:39:12,756 --> 00:39:14,390
which makes me yell things like...

846
00:39:14,458 --> 00:39:17,727
"That teapot's spreading lies about me!"

847
00:39:17,795 --> 00:39:21,518
Or... "That can't be my baby,
because I don't love it!"

848
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:24,934
Ms. Holliday, can I talk to you for a sec?

849
00:39:25,002 --> 00:39:26,476
Sure.

850
00:39:26,677 --> 00:39:28,571
Guys, practice your bipolar rants, okay?

851
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:31,441
See? History can be fun!

852
00:39:31,508 --> 00:39:33,443
How are you holding up?

853
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,677
Okay.

854
00:39:34,745 --> 00:39:37,309
I'm back to my itinerant ways, I guess.

855
00:39:38,415 --> 00:39:40,283
I do miss Glee Club, though.

856
00:39:40,351 --> 00:39:42,085
Well, as much as the kids like me,

857
00:39:42,152 --> 00:39:43,720
they sure do miss you.

858
00:39:43,787 --> 00:39:45,488
Which is why next time I'm sick,

859
00:39:45,556 --> 00:39:47,090
I'm requesting you as the Glee sub.

860
00:39:47,157 --> 00:39:49,058
Really?

861
00:39:49,126 --> 00:39:51,494
Mr. Schuester, that's so nice of you.

862
00:39:51,562 --> 00:39:54,797
It would be nice to feel like
a part of something, you know?

863
00:39:54,865 --> 00:39:57,166
I know.

864
00:39:57,234 --> 00:39:58,668
I actually need your help

865
00:39:58,736 --> 00:40:00,303
with something else, though.

866
00:40:00,371 --> 00:40:02,338
See, I've been dying to
do singin' in the rain

867
00:40:02,406 --> 00:40:05,341
with the kids, show them how great it is,

868
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:07,810
but they're convinced
