kids recruited from all over the world
for their talent,

00:00:22,286 --> 00:00:24,254

and strength

9
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,358
being the coach
of Vocal Adrenaline

10
00:00:28,392 --> 00:00:30,560
has a few other perks,
like this company car,

00:00:30,595 --> 00:00:32,896
my own massage therapist,

12
00:00:32,931 --> 00:00:36,700

I'll admit I do miss

My wife says
this one is the best.

31
00:01:19,176 --> 00:01:21,110
Wow, really this is
so unnecessary.

32
00:01:21,145 --> 00:01:22,845
I was always
a football guy myself.

33
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,781
But my flaming gay son
loves show choir.

34
00:01:25,815 --> 00:01:28,484
- Ah.
- And championships are championships.

35
00:01:28,518 --> 00:01:30,419
So, I'm throwing
all my influence

36
00:01:30,453 --> 00:01:33,455
behind Vocal Adrenaline.

00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:34,823
(Both laugh)

38
00:01:34,857 --> 00:01:36,258
And we're all counting

39
00:01:36,293 --> 00:01:39,600
on another win this year,
Mr. Schuester.

40
00:01:41,245 --> 00:01:42,998
Oh, I think as long
as you're happy

41
00:01:43,032 --> 00:01:45,167
and feeling good,
we support you.

42
00:01:45,202 --> 00:01:48,704
I mean, you need to just keep
being honest with yourself.

43
00:01:48,738 --> 00:01:50,137
The way I see it,
I'm playing the long game

44
00:01:50,172 --> 00:01:52,139
in terms of making
real changes there.

45
00:01:52,174 --> 00:01:54,008
I can't expect to go
in there and alter

46
00:01:54,042 --> 00:01:55,210
their whole way of doing things.

47
00:01:55,244 --> 00:01:57,044
My dream is to combine
the resources

48
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:59,113
and support of Vocal Adrenaline

49
00:01:59,147 --> 00:02:01,649
with the heart and inspirations
of the New Directions!

50
00:02:01,684 --> 00:02:04,285
Well, if anybody can
do that, you can.

51
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,154
Ah! What do you say
we let him out to play, huh?

52
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:08,523
What... here? Oh, my God, no.

53
00:02:08,557 --> 00:02:10,553
He might touch something.

54
00:02:11,282 --> 00:02:12,626
Life is good.

55
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,196
What? (Laughs)

56
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,296
(Gasps) Oh!

57
00:02:16,331 --> 00:02:17,798
Oh, my God! What happened?

58
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,700
Your team Vocal Adrenaline.

59
00:02:19,735 --> 00:02:21,501
They decided to go
with the tradition

60
00:02:21,536 --> 00:02:24,062
of egging the competition.

61
00:02:28,472 --> 00:02:30,644

from my friends

Rachel Berry
and Blaine Anderson,

68
00:02:55,102 --> 00:02:57,271
the coaches of the New
Directions! and Warblers,

69
00:02:57,305 --> 00:02:58,905
that they were egged

70
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:01,874
by my kids the other day
on the way to their cars.

71
00:03:01,908 --> 00:03:03,041
Come on, guys!

72
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:04,677
I have to put my foot down!

73
00:03:04,711 --> 00:03:06,211
This kind of bullying
will not be tolerated!

74
00:03:06,246 --> 00:03:08,781
Hey, I think you're being intolerant
of our intolerance, Will.

75
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:10,283
It's Mr. Schuester.

76
00:03:10,317 --> 00:03:12,951
And don't be such
a smart ass, Clint.

77
00:03:12,986 --> 00:03:15,621
This week...

78
00:03:15,656 --> 00:03:17,189
We're gonna be taking turns
performing songs

79
00:03:17,223 --> 00:03:19,592
dealing with the theme
of "tolerance."

80
00:03:19,626 --> 00:03:21,960
I will lead by example.

81
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:24,297
And I've invited
a very special guest to join me.

82
00:03:24,331 --> 00:03:27,204

You can't be serious.

122
00:05:03,995 --> 00:05:05,228
Serious as a hangnail, honey.

123
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,897
Shut up, stop rapping

124
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,698
and let us rehearse
for sectionals.

125
00:05:08,732 --> 00:05:11,201
We don't care about
gay or straight

- No, wait.

00:05:14,438 --> 00:05:15,906
This is genius.

129
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,707
If we can get the New
Directions! worked up

130
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:20,410
into thinking we're intolerant
of an entire group of people,

131
00:05:20,444 --> 00:05:21,878
they'll go
into will Schuester mode.

132
00:05:21,913 --> 00:05:23,479
And dedicate an
entire week of practice

133
00:05:23,514 --> 00:05:24,514
to a lesson about tolerance.

134
00:05:24,548 --> 00:05:26,049
Hey!

135
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,583
This behavior is over.

136
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,385
Yes, you are talented.

137
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,888
No, that does not give the right
to behave however you want.

138
00:05:31,922 --> 00:05:33,989
Now, like it or not,
I am running this

139
00:05:34,024 --> 00:05:36,025
show choir now, and I'm
gonna run it how I like.

00:05:37,594 --> 00:05:40,195
Man: Well, McKinley, this is it.

142
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,765
It took a long time to get here.

143
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,835
And my heart's racing like a
slow pig at a sausage factory.

144
00:05:45,869 --> 00:05:48,404
But I can truly say that today

145
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:50,825
I'm living the life
I always wanted.

146
00:05:52,876 --> 00:05:54,510
I took some time off

147
00:05:54,545 --> 00:05:57,046
to let my outsides catch up
with my insides.

148
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,849
But now I'm ready to take
this old jalopy for a spin.

149
00:06:00,883 --> 00:06:03,085
So...

150
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:06,322
Say hello
to coach Sheldon Beiste.

151
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:09,791
Sue: Coach!

152
00:06:09,826 --> 00:06:11,093
Welcome back!
You know, from a distance,

153
00:06:11,127 --> 00:06:13,228
I almost mistook you
for an aging

154
00:06:13,263 --> 00:06:15,364
yet virile James Garner.

155
00:06:15,398 --> 00:06:16,631
- Oh, thanks, Sue.
- Mm-hmm.

156
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,200
It's-it's good to be back.
Coach!

157
00:06:18,234 --> 00:06:19,401
It is so good to have
you back and in true form.

158
00:06:19,436 --> 00:06:20,602
Oh, my gosh!

159
00:06:20,636 --> 00:06:21,870
We got so much guy talk
to catch up on

160
00:06:21,904 --> 00:06:23,304
that we never even
got to do before.

161
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:25,373
Like, uh, about me and Rachel

162
00:06:25,407 --> 00:06:27,442
and then Mercedes, I
talked to her, we're cool.

163
00:06:27,477 --> 00:06:29,043
You're fine, Sam.
Just take a breath

164
00:06:29,078 --> 00:06:30,579
so you don't black out on me.

165
00:06:30,613 --> 00:06:32,614
Hey, coach, I want you to know
that I've taken steps

166
00:06:32,648 --> 00:06:35,216
to battle the scourge
of cisnormativity

167
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,218
- Uh-huh.
- And transmisogyny.

168
00:06:37,252 --> 00:06:38,753
And some other terms
I had never heard of

169
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:40,956
until I did a quick Wikipedia
search this morning.

170
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,257
Um, thanks, but I just
want things to go

171
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:44,993
- right on back to normal.
- Yeah, yeah.

172
00:06:45,027 --> 00:06:47,328
Oh, good 'cause I wro... had
this list of all these pronouns.

173
00:06:47,363 --> 00:06:48,829
I mean, you just tell me
which one and I'll enforce it.

174
00:06:48,864 --> 00:06:50,398
There's he, there's sh-he,
there's it,

175
00:06:50,432 --> 00:06:53,001
zhim, ze...

176
00:06:53,035 --> 00:06:56,070
I-I think he and him works fine.

177
00:06:56,105 --> 00:06:57,238
Now, coach, as you know,
I've always been

178
00:06:57,272 --> 00:06:58,639
quite vocal about my opposition

179
00:06:58,673 --> 00:07:01,409
to bullying in any form.

180
00:07:01,443 --> 00:07:03,111
And I want you to know
that I am here for you

181
00:07:03,145 --> 00:07:05,979
as a friend, ally

182
00:07:06,014 --> 00:07:08,448
and a shoulder to cry on.

183
00:07:08,483 --> 00:07:10,083
Metaphorically, of course.

184
00:07:10,118 --> 00:07:12,152
Because you're a man now
and real men don't cry.

185
00:07:12,186 --> 00:07:14,121
I got to say I'm impressed, Sue.

186
00:07:14,155 --> 00:07:16,289
I kind of figured someone
would say something.

187
00:07:16,324 --> 00:07:18,158
Or gawk at me funny or...

188
00:07:18,192 --> 00:07:20,460
Coach, you will be happy to know
that McKinley high is now

189
00:07:20,495 --> 00:07:23,096
a fully gender-fluid
high school.

190
00:07:23,131 --> 00:07:24,697
- Wow.
- All right?

191
00:07:24,732 --> 00:07:27,167
Now, if you'll excuse me,
out of the corner of my eye I see a fatty

192
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:30,326
who could use a good,
healthy fat shaming.

193
00:07:31,372 --> 00:07:32,372
Hmm.

194
00:07:32,407 --> 00:07:34,807
Uh, well, you know,
I should probably get going.

195
00:07:34,842 --> 00:07:36,509
Yeah, I got to go
meet Rachel and, um...

196
00:07:36,544 --> 00:07:38,177
High five!

197
00:07:38,211 --> 00:07:40,642
Yeah, that's some strength, huh?

198
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,751
(School bell ringing)

199
00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:47,854
Morning!

200
00:07:47,888 --> 00:07:49,221
What's wrong?

201
00:07:49,256 --> 00:07:50,623
Are you still upset
about getting egged

202
00:07:50,658 --> 00:07:52,167
- and stuff?
- No, Sam, something happened.

203
00:07:52,187 --> 00:07:53,279
Something way worse.

204
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:54,860
Early this morning,
I was fast asleep,

205
00:07:54,894 --> 00:07:56,362
and I was having
the most amazing dream

206
00:07:56,396 --> 00:07:57,463
that I was on Broadway

207
00:07:57,497 --> 00:07:58,830
and there was all this pudding.

208
00:07:58,865 --> 00:08:00,566
And then I woke up
to this pounding!

209
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,401
(Banging nearby)

210
00:08:02,436 --> 00:08:05,204
At first I thought it was just
a really big woodpecker.

211
00:08:05,238 --> 00:08:07,039
Or maybe a neighbor was
installing an in-ground pool.

212
00:08:07,074 --> 00:08:09,508
But then I saw what it was.

213
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,813
My dad sold our house!

214
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,315
Wait, but isn't, isn't that a
good thing? You said it's

215
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:17,849
been on the market for a while
now, and every time they had

216
00:08:17,884 --> 00:08:19,585
an offer, the buyer just
backed out at the last minute.

217
00:08:19,619 --> 00:08:21,753
Yes! That's because
I was sabotaging it!

218
00:08:21,788 --> 00:08:23,589
The shower has vintage tile.

219
00:08:23,623 --> 00:08:24,923
(Groaning)

220
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,091
(Screams)

221
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,426
Rachel, that's insane.

222
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:29,928
Sam, it's the only house
I've ever known.

223
00:08:29,963 --> 00:08:31,563
It's the house
that I grew up in.

224
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:33,599
And-and I just really,
I-I hate the idea

225
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:36,034
that in a couple of days
it's gonna be someone else's.

226
00:08:36,069 --> 00:08:38,203
All right, listen.

227
00:08:38,237 --> 00:08:40,238
As somebody who sometimes
didn't have any home at all...

228
00:08:40,272 --> 00:08:41,606
No, no. Mm-mm!

229
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,407
Mm-mm! No way.

230
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:45,109
I am not gonna let you guilt me

231
00:08:45,143 --> 00:08:47,612
into going along with this
because you once were homeless!

232
00:08:47,646 --> 00:08:49,580
Okay? I'm sorry, but that has
nothing to do with this.

233
00:08:49,615 --> 00:08:52,049
I just... I'm not
ready to say good-bye.

234
00:08:52,084 --> 00:08:55,685
And I will be damned if I let
my dads go through with this.

235
00:08:57,055 --> 00:08:59,056
Hey, guys, hey.
Thanks for coming.

236
00:08:59,091 --> 00:09:01,625
Oh, for the love of all
that's sacred, what now?

237
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:04,360
Uh, well, I called you here
today because of Rachel.

238
00:09:04,394 --> 00:09:06,429
Seriously? I just finished
mentoring that girl

239
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,631
for, like, a week... what could
she possibly need now?

240
00:09:08,665 --> 00:09:10,566
- Do you want to...?
- Her dad just sold their house.

241
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:11,934
She has less than
a week to get out.

242
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,569
That house means
everything to her.

243
00:09:13,604 --> 00:09:15,070
It's where she grew up.

244
00:09:15,105 --> 00:09:16,439
It's where she saw her dreams
become a reality.

245
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:17,906
Guys, this is a major
moment for her.

246
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:19,642
Okay? She's becoming
a new person.

247
00:09:19,676 --> 00:09:21,377
Making one of the
biggest transitions of all.

248
00:09:21,411 --> 00:09:23,379
One that we are all
gonna have to make soon.

249
00:09:23,413 --> 00:09:24,880
Okay, just so we're clear.

250
00:09:24,914 --> 00:09:26,149
We're still talking
about Rachel, right?

251
00:09:26,183 --> 00:09:27,650
Or are you announcing
your new gender?

252
00:09:27,684 --> 00:09:29,452
Oh, my God! No!
This is all about Rachel!

253
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,085
Look, guys, she's growing up.

254
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,086
We all are.

255
00:09:32,121 --> 00:09:34,422
So, what's the plan, Sam?

256
00:09:36,425 --> 00:09:38,793
(School bell ringing)

257
00:09:52,307 --> 00:09:54,308
(Kids cheering, whooping)

258
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:03,901
- You want to see me?
- Have a seat, William.

259
00:10:05,886 --> 00:10:09,235
Hey, Sheldon.
How you doing?

260
00:10:10,228 --> 00:10:11,841
Wait, what's going on?

261
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,212
It's not a big deal.

262
00:10:13,247 --> 00:10:15,615
Sue's just making
a big stink over nothing.

263
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,684
America's newest male
Sheldon Beiste

264
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:19,019
arrived in our parking lot
yesterday

265
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:21,054
to find his car vandalized

266
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:22,522
with a horribly

267
00:10:22,557 --> 00:10:24,390
offensive word.

268
00:10:24,425 --> 00:10:25,959
Oh, my God.

269
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:27,694
That's terrible.

270
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:29,395
Sheldon, I'm so sorry.

271
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,896
It's all right.

272
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:33,065
I knew that there was
a possibility

273
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,633
that something like this
was gonna happen.

274
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:37,870
So when it did,
I wasn't all that surprised.

275
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,204
I-I'm sorry. Just, um,

276
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:41,974
you-you said it
happened here, so

277
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,241
what does this
have to do with me?

278
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:44,677
Newly boobless,

279
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,879
would you like to tell him
or shall I?

280
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:50,049
They wore Carmel colors, Will.

281
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,684
They were from Vocal Adrenaline.

282
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,489
They were your kids.

283
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:55,877
Are you serious?

284
00:10:58,344 --> 00:10:59,391
No one goes after one

285
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,025
of my friends and
gets away with it.

286
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,660
Except for me.
I always go after your friends,

287
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,096
and I've never not gotten away
with it.

288
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,697
(Sighs)

289
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,699
(School bell ringing) I'm sorry.

290
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,368
Okay, you guys, let's get
started on this week's lesson.

291
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,936
It is called buckeye bull's-eye,

292
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,939
featuring all artists from Ohio!

293
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,709
Marilyn Manson
and Dean Martin...

294
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:20,578
Actually, Rachel, there has
been a slight change in plans.

295
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,538
Kurt, you can't just change
the lesson like that.

296
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:24,482
Well, sometimes life throws you
a curveball,

297
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,850
and you just got to embrace it.

298
00:11:26,609 --> 00:11:28,820
That's why
this week's lesson is...

299
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:31,055
Transitioning.

300
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,357
Changing.

301
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,725
Charging forward.

302
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,493
Rachel, it's come
to our attention

303
00:11:35,513 --> 00:11:38,077
that you have some challenges
with saying good-bye

304
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,330
to your childhood home.

305
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:41,298
Which is forcing you
to say good-bye

306
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,301
to your childhood
and fully accept adulthood.

307
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,370
Or at least that's according
to the very nice lady

308
00:11:46,404 --> 00:11:48,172
at the lima
mental health clinic.

309
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,474
Sam: So to help Rachel
with this new transition,

310
00:11:50,508 --> 00:11:53,911
we are throwing her a "farewell
to Rachel's house" party,

311
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,813
and everyone's invited. It's going to
be Friday night in Rachel's basement.

312
00:11:56,848 --> 00:11:59,850
You guys, this is very
unnecessary but very sweet.

313
00:11:59,884 --> 00:12:01,384
Madison:
Wait, so this lesson isn't

314
00:12:01,418 --> 00:12:02,819
- for us?
- It's for Rachel?

315
00:12:02,854 --> 00:12:05,222
Yeah, so shut up.
Fetch me my wheel!

316
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,829
Thank you. Welcome
to wheel of musical fortune!

317
00:12:12,864 --> 00:12:15,398
(Applause) Thank you. Thank you.

318
00:12:15,432 --> 00:12:17,533
Everyone spins,
and whoever's name you land on,

319
00:12:17,568 --> 00:12:19,435
you have to sing a duet
with them at the party.

320
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,203
All except for me. 'Cause I told
you I want to sing with Rachel.

321
00:12:21,238 --> 00:12:23,172
I don't want to chance it.
Fine. Whatever.

322
00:12:23,206 --> 00:12:24,807
Can't we just pick names
out of a hat?

323
00:12:26,377 --> 00:12:28,655
Okay, I'll go first.

324
00:12:29,188 --> 00:12:31,013
Luck be a lady tonight!

325
00:12:31,047 --> 00:12:32,882
(Whoops)

326
00:12:36,324 --> 00:12:37,452
Roderick.

327
00:12:37,487 --> 00:12:39,120
Which-which one?

328
00:12:39,155 --> 00:12:41,856
Uh, me. I'm-I'm Roderick.

329
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:44,201
No, this is gonna be great.
You're great.

330
00:12:44,594 --> 00:12:45,794
Okay, my turn!

331
00:12:45,828 --> 00:12:47,896
(Applause)

332
00:13:03,512 --> 00:13:06,447
Oh. Huh.

333
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:08,882
(Sighs)

334
00:13:08,917 --> 00:13:10,284
Well, I thought for sure

335
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:11,952
that wheel was gonna land
on Artie's name.

336
00:13:11,986 --> 00:13:13,454
Yeah, what are the odds?

337
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:15,055
Uh, ten to one. Not that high.

338
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:16,556
But you're totally cool
with singing with me, right?

339
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,791
I-I understand if not.

340
00:13:17,825 --> 00:13:18,792
Yeah, no, I really want to.

341
00:13:18,826 --> 00:13:20,126
It's-it's just...

342
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,295
If you see Dave,

343
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,963
just don't bring it up, okay?

344
00:13:23,997 --> 00:13:25,598
Oh, come on. It's just a song.

345
00:13:25,633 --> 00:13:27,334
He can't be jealous from that.

346
00:13:27,368 --> 00:13:29,769
I know, but I think
that he thinks that there's...

347
00:13:29,804 --> 00:13:31,961
still something between us.

348
00:13:32,473 --> 00:13:33,673
Which there...

349
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,141
obviously isn't.

350
00:13:35,175 --> 00:13:36,943
Obviously.

351
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,681
Anyway, I'll call you. We'll
figure out what we're doing.

352
00:13:41,716 --> 00:13:43,014
We can do something up-tempo.

353
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:44,282
Or-or slow. It doesn't matter.

354
00:13:44,317 --> 00:13:45,317
I'm versatile.

355
00:13:45,352 --> 00:13:46,785
Okay. Cool.

356
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:50,723
All right. I'll call you.

357
00:13:57,029 --> 00:13:58,296
(School bell ringing)

358
00:13:58,331 --> 00:14:00,932
Who was it? I just
heard. I want names.

359
00:14:00,967 --> 00:14:03,168
Which one of those Vocal
Adrenaline bastards did it?

360
00:14:03,202 --> 00:14:06,036
What the fall leaves are you
talking about, pumpkin?

361
00:14:06,071 --> 00:14:08,639
Your car, the vandalism. Which one of
those rock lobsters was it?

362
00:14:08,674 --> 00:14:10,875
- It doesn't matter.
- We're gonna kill those guys, coach.

363
00:14:10,909 --> 00:14:13,210
No, you're not gonna kill
anybody. You boys sit down.

364
00:14:13,245 --> 00:14:14,245
Sit down!

365
00:14:17,483 --> 00:14:20,518
I don't want you guys doing
anything about this,

366
00:14:20,552 --> 00:14:22,319
you hear me? It's been handled.

367
00:14:22,354 --> 00:14:24,555
It's real sweet
that you guys care,

368
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,323
but hurting him
isn't gonna fix anything.

369
00:14:26,358 --> 00:14:28,325
It'll teach them not
to mess with any of us

370
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,026
or we'll destroy them.

371
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,697
(Sighs) I've been dealing
with ignorant people

372
00:14:33,731 --> 00:14:35,699
who couldn't understand me
my whole life.

373
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:38,968
But you know what? I couldn't be
happier with myself.

374
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,571
How many people get
to say that? And, Spencer,

375
00:14:41,606 --> 00:14:43,339
I'm glad to hear you say
that you're one of us.

376
00:14:43,374 --> 00:14:45,542
That's all
I've ever wanted to hear

377
00:14:45,576 --> 00:14:48,879
from you, is that you're more
than just a star player

378
00:14:48,913 --> 00:14:51,347
but that you're really part
of this team.

379
00:14:51,382 --> 00:14:53,182
And, Sam, you did that.

380
00:14:53,217 --> 00:14:55,218
You united us.

381
00:14:55,252 --> 00:14:57,587
You're a hell of a
coach and a friend.

382
00:14:57,622 --> 00:15:00,423
And if one good thing can come
out of this whole mess,

383
00:15:00,457 --> 00:15:03,026
well, then they gave us
the best freaking gift

384
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,360
in the whole world.

385
00:15:04,395 --> 00:15:05,261
(Chuckles)

386
00:15:05,296 --> 00:15:06,930
Coach, look, I'm sorry.

387
00:15:06,964 --> 00:15:08,364
I didn't... I didn't mean
to disappoint you.

388
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,899
I just...

389
00:15:09,934 --> 00:15:11,434
I can't stand
to see my friends get hurt.

390
00:15:11,468 --> 00:15:13,269
I know that, Sam.

391
00:15:13,304 --> 00:15:15,171
And you did not disappoint me.

392
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,907
In fact, I couldn't be prouder.

393
00:15:17,942 --> 00:15:20,476
Boys, get back to practice.

394
00:15:30,627 --> 00:15:33,233
This is completely unacceptable.

395
00:15:33,456 --> 00:15:35,057
I can handle insubordination,

396
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:37,059
but this, this isn't about me.

397
00:15:37,093 --> 00:15:39,928
This is about teaching you
to act like human beings.

398
00:15:39,963 --> 00:15:42,264
It's about knowing
that your-your common decency

399
00:15:42,298 --> 00:15:44,599
and integrity
are-are more important

400
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:46,601
than winning
show choir competitions.

401
00:15:46,635 --> 00:15:48,803
Which perfectly sums up
your teaching style, Schuester.

402
00:15:48,838 --> 00:15:51,639
You think all of us didn't know
you were too soft for this job?

403
00:15:51,674 --> 00:15:53,775
You have a loser mentality.

404
00:15:53,809 --> 00:15:55,777
You know who didn't give a crap
about being kind?

405
00:15:55,811 --> 00:15:58,446
Lewis and Clark.
George Patton. Paul Anka.

406
00:15:58,481 --> 00:16:00,448
I don't want to be decent or
liked. I want to be a champion.

407
00:16:00,483 --> 00:16:01,749
And this is how it's done.

408
00:16:01,784 --> 00:16:02,917
The fact is

409
00:16:02,952 --> 00:16:04,318
Vocal Adrenaline is the last

410
00:16:04,353 --> 00:16:06,320
of a great dying breed
of communities

411
00:16:06,355 --> 00:16:08,422
that is willing
to risk being called bad guys

412
00:16:08,457 --> 00:16:10,224
and accept the hard truth,

413
00:16:10,258 --> 00:16:12,794
which is that every person
on the planet knows

414
00:16:12,828 --> 00:16:13,928
winning is everything.

415
00:16:13,963 --> 00:16:15,730
(Cheering)

416
00:16:15,764 --> 00:16:17,999
We will win nationals,

417
00:16:18,033 --> 00:16:20,734
- but we'll win it the right way.
- When will you just accept

418
00:16:20,768 --> 00:16:22,470
that you don't belong here,

419
00:16:22,504 --> 00:16:24,005
that none of us like you,

420
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,839
that we make fun of your vests

421
00:16:25,874 --> 00:16:27,774
and your pep talks
behind your back?

422
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:30,277
- You're a joke.
- Yeah, well, the joke's on you, Clint.

423
00:16:30,312 --> 00:16:32,846
You're off the team. (Scoffs)

424
00:16:32,881 --> 00:16:34,748
You can't kick me off the team.

425
00:16:34,782 --> 00:16:36,783
I am the team!

426
00:16:37,841 --> 00:16:38,952
Get out.

427
00:16:39,788 --> 00:16:41,451
Now.

428
00:16:50,063 --> 00:16:50,997
Okay.

429
00:16:51,032 --> 00:16:53,400
Everybody warm up.

430
00:16:59,423 --> 00:17:01,049
(Grunts) Come to bed, Will. Oh.

431
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:03,660
Maybe just have a shower first
because you're touching

432
00:17:03,694 --> 00:17:05,161
that wheel
that touched the ground.

433
00:17:05,195 --> 00:17:06,996
You would think a stroller
that costs as much

434
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,294
as a mortgage payment would not
break a week after you got it.

435
00:17:10,951 --> 00:17:12,569
Okay.

436
00:17:12,603 --> 00:17:15,171
You're talking
in your angry man voice.

437
00:17:15,205 --> 00:17:16,406
(Sighs)

438
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,641
I'm sorry.

439
00:17:17,675 --> 00:17:20,644
It's just... (Sighs)

440
00:17:21,852 --> 00:17:23,146
I'm stuck.

441
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,515
I really don't like my job.

442
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:27,917
I don't like the people or the
environment, and it's not gonna change

443
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:29,886
because they don't think
there's anything wrong.

444
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,655
I kicked that kid
off the team today,

445
00:17:31,689 --> 00:17:33,389
but I know
that's not the end of it.

446
00:17:33,423 --> 00:17:35,591
Those boosters are gonna come
after me.

447
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:38,160
Okay, well, look,
I don't need any of this stuff.

448
00:17:38,194 --> 00:17:40,028
It's not like we'd have
to go on food stamps

449
00:17:40,062 --> 00:17:41,430
if you quit
and found another job.

450
00:17:41,464 --> 00:17:44,032
I know some teachers who are.
(Sighs)

451
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:47,035
And we've talked about this,
Emma. There are no other jobs.

452
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:49,037
Not ones
where I can coach show choir.

453
00:17:49,071 --> 00:17:51,373
(Sighs) You know what
the worst part is?

454
00:17:51,408 --> 00:17:54,543
I love all this extra stuff.

455
00:17:54,577 --> 00:17:57,746
I love my fancy car
and fancy stroller

456
00:17:57,781 --> 00:17:59,595
and fancy football tickets.

457
00:17:59,794 --> 00:18:02,350
Maybe that makes me shallow
and immature, but...

458
00:18:02,384 --> 00:18:06,621
all this extra stuff makes me
feel like more of a man.

459
00:18:06,655 --> 00:18:09,056
And I hate myself
for loving it so much

460
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,459
that I would stay working
at a place

461
00:18:11,493 --> 00:18:14,462
that stands for everything
I stand against.

462
00:18:14,496 --> 00:18:16,698
Okay. So we'll manage.

463
00:18:16,732 --> 00:18:19,033
You know?
You'll find another job.

464
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:21,035
My pamphlet of the month club
is starting

465
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:23,438
to bring in some extra cash.

466
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,874
A year ago, I would have.

467
00:18:26,894 --> 00:18:28,710
(Scoffs) You can be principled

468
00:18:28,744 --> 00:18:31,045
when you don't have kids to feed
and clothe.

469
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,880
Well, I think when you have kids

470
00:18:32,914 --> 00:18:35,316
is when it's most
important to be principled.

471
00:18:37,631 --> 00:18:39,653
He's gonna be watching you, Will.

472
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:41,822
(Sighs) Kids see everything.

473
00:18:41,857 --> 00:18:43,724
You can't hide
anything from them.

474
00:18:43,758 --> 00:18:46,626
I mean,
when you buy him something,

475
00:18:46,661 --> 00:18:48,462
he's gonna see your pride
and your shame.

476
00:18:48,496 --> 00:18:50,231
He's gonna know
when you traded your integrity

477
00:18:50,265 --> 00:18:52,228
for comfort and safety.

478
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:56,337
Look, I'm not saying
that you have to quit your job.

479
00:18:56,371 --> 00:19:00,107
I understand the realities
of that. I do.

480
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,509
But I am saying...

481
00:19:02,543 --> 00:19:06,230
you need to make a peace with
whatever choice you do make.

482
00:19:07,451 --> 00:19:08,681
Okay?

483
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:10,082
Yeah.

484
00:19:11,285 --> 00:19:14,087
(Whirring) (Indistinct chatter)

485
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:16,956
Snuck a little something extra
in there for you, Kurt.

486
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,196
Artie: Hello, everyone. Welcome
and thank you for coming

487
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,599

The Rachel Berry
childhood bedroom.

536
00:21:40,461 --> 00:21:42,662
Is it weird to think
that someday this room's

537
00:21:42,696 --> 00:21:44,663
gonna be recreated
in some Broadway museum?

538
00:21:44,697 --> 00:21:46,665
Hopefully with
animatronic robots.

wear those tight gold shorts?

542
00:21:53,273 --> 00:21:55,074
I think everyone remembers that.

543
00:21:55,108 --> 00:21:57,576
Wow.

544
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,478
You can't do it, can you?

545
00:21:59,513 --> 00:22:01,080
I mean,

546
00:22:01,114 --> 00:22:02,915
almost everything else
is boxed up, but

547
00:22:02,949 --> 00:22:04,883
you haven't even
touched this wall.

548
00:22:06,786 --> 00:22:09,188
All my best memories from
high school are on that wall.

549
00:22:09,222 --> 00:22:13,091
My whole childhood
I just spent in this room

550
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,994
singing and dreaming, all alone

551
00:22:16,029 --> 00:22:17,796
with pictures
of Barbara Streisand

552
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,131
and Patti Lupone
and Bernadette Peters.

553
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,467
But then I met you
guys and suddenly

554
00:22:22,501 --> 00:22:24,469
the wall started to fill
up with real friends

555
00:22:24,503 --> 00:22:26,471
and real dreams.

556
00:22:26,505 --> 00:22:28,774
I don't know. Everything's
just so clear in high school

557
00:22:28,808 --> 00:22:31,743
and I'm supposed to just
pack it all up now?

558
00:22:33,046 --> 00:22:34,546
We're gonna need a bigger wall.

559
00:22:36,015 --> 00:22:37,482
Mm... Star wars.

560
00:22:37,516 --> 00:22:38,983
It's... it's Jaws.

561
00:22:39,017 --> 00:22:42,519
Oh. Jeez, what were
you, raised by monks?

562
00:22:42,554 --> 00:22:44,555
Come here.

563
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,127
The wall doesn't go away.

564
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:52,997
The wall just gets... bigger.

565
00:22:53,031 --> 00:22:55,466
And higher

566
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,235
and plastered in dreams.

567
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:02,172
You're going to get that part.

568
00:23:03,205 --> 00:23:05,542
And you're going
back to New York.

569
00:23:05,577 --> 00:23:07,812
And you're taking
that wall with you.

570
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:09,313
If I'm real lucky, then

571
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:11,315
I'll always be on it somewhere,

572
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:13,483

573
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,122
sparkly gold shorts.

Thank you. Good job.

sharp for the intramural

631
00:26:09,494 --> 00:26:12,062
Well, anyway, I had a lot
of fun singing with you tonight.

632
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:14,398
- I thought we sounded pretty good.
- I thought we sounded incredible.

633
00:26:14,432 --> 00:26:16,666
We haven't sounded that good
since the very first duet that we did.

634

- No, I'm blanking.

I'm kidding, of course I do.

637
00:26:24,275 --> 00:26:26,142
The entire time
we were singing I just wanted

638
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,743
to turn off that damn boom box

639
00:26:27,777 --> 00:26:29,412

my undying love for you

640
00:26:29,446 --> 00:26:31,147

felt the same way.

00:29:59,371 --> 00:30:01,005
my trans-gossip
from will Schuester.

699
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,341
You're right.
I should have called.

700
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:05,342
I just didn't know
what to say to people.

701
00:30:05,376 --> 00:30:08,178
You know? It's all been
a bit overwhelming.

702
00:30:08,212 --> 00:30:10,714
Being back at McKinley
or the surgery?

703
00:30:10,748 --> 00:30:12,949
About being myself, you know?

704
00:30:12,983 --> 00:30:14,351
Trying to fit in.

705
00:30:14,385 --> 00:30:15,919
You know, I did this

706
00:30:15,953 --> 00:30:18,522
because I needed to follow
how I felt inside.

707
00:30:18,556 --> 00:30:22,392
And I finally feel
so normal inside.

708
00:30:22,427 --> 00:30:24,894
(Sighs) But...

709
00:30:24,929 --> 00:30:27,130
Nobody's treating me
like I am normal.

710
00:30:27,164 --> 00:30:29,466
That's because you're
not normal. You're special.

711
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,702
And not because
of some surgery, but

712
00:30:31,736 --> 00:30:33,236
because you're
brave enough to go out

713
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,749
and get something
when you want it.

714
00:30:36,394 --> 00:30:37,906
I don't want to always

715
00:30:37,941 --> 00:30:40,209
be special, though.
Does that make sense?

716
00:30:40,243 --> 00:30:41,977
I just want to be
one of the guys.

717
00:30:42,011 --> 00:30:45,047
But there's
no one else like me here.

718
00:30:45,081 --> 00:30:47,149
You know, people
either fawn over me

719
00:30:47,183 --> 00:30:50,503
or they hate me because
they don't understand me.

720
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:56,425
Can I ask you something?

721
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,161
- Did it hurt?
- (Soft laugh) Are you joking?

722
00:30:59,195 --> 00:31:02,331
Like a bucket of hammers
being dumped on my chest.

723
00:31:02,366 --> 00:31:03,466
(Laughs)

724
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,735
But the weird thing...
it felt like

725
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:07,802
they never should have been
there in the first place.

726
00:31:07,837 --> 00:31:09,571
Do you have any regrets?

727
00:31:09,605 --> 00:31:11,906
Not for a second.

728
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,908
That feeling of relief
I have now

729
00:31:13,942 --> 00:31:15,910
of finally being who
I've always wanted to be...

730
00:31:15,944 --> 00:31:17,912
it's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

731
00:31:17,946 --> 00:31:20,014
I just...

732
00:31:20,048 --> 00:31:23,889
I wish sometimes I wasn't
going through it all alone.

733
00:31:26,413 --> 00:31:28,275
You're not alone.

734
00:31:32,795 --> 00:31:34,429
Hey, Mr. Schuester,

735
00:31:34,463 --> 00:31:36,464
I'm not sure if you heard,
but when Jimbo Wilson

736
00:31:36,499 --> 00:31:38,966
found out that you kicked me
off the team, he threw a tizzy

737
00:31:39,001 --> 00:31:41,035
and told Principal
Gunderson to reinstate me.

738
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:43,704
If you have
a problem with that...

739
00:31:43,738 --> 00:31:46,207
and I hope you do...

740
00:31:46,241 --> 00:31:48,175
Jimbo says
to call him personally.

741
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:50,378
I don't have
a problem with that.

742
00:31:50,412 --> 00:31:53,114
He's right. And I was wrong.

743
00:31:53,148 --> 00:31:55,449
You are this team. You represent

744
00:31:55,483 --> 00:31:56,784
everything this
place stands for,

745
00:31:56,818 --> 00:31:58,552
and I have put
my personal beliefs

746
00:31:58,586 --> 00:32:01,355
ahead of the reality
of what Vocal Adrenaline is.

747
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,157
To be honest,

748
00:32:03,191 --> 00:32:05,993
I was thinking about quitting.

749
00:32:06,028 --> 00:32:08,396
But then I realized
I still may be able

750
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,063
to teach you guys
a thing or two.

751
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:12,299
That said, you certainly

752
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:14,134
have found the
formula to winning.

753
00:32:14,168 --> 00:32:15,868
Who am I to try to change that?

754
00:32:15,903 --> 00:32:17,537
So as long as I'm coaching here,

755
00:32:17,571 --> 00:32:19,739
we win the V.A. way.

756
00:32:19,773 --> 00:32:21,574
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

757
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:23,209
That's what I'm talking about.

758
00:32:23,244 --> 00:32:25,211
And to prove to you
guys that I'm serious,

759
00:32:25,246 --> 00:32:28,381
I have come up with a prank
to end all pranks.

760
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,550
Bring it in. Tonight,

761
00:32:30,584 --> 00:32:32,819
we sneak into McKinley High,

762
00:32:32,853 --> 00:32:35,154
and I will show you all
that nobody understands

763
00:32:35,188 --> 00:32:38,991
psychological warfare
better than William Schuester.

764
00:32:39,025 --> 00:32:41,527
All: Yeah! (Whooping)

765
00:32:41,562 --> 00:32:44,831
You know, I told them if they
put that clumsy, fatass Craig

766
00:32:44,865 --> 00:32:47,199
on defense we'd blow the game
and what do they do?

767
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:49,234
They put that clumsy,
fatass Craig

768
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:52,059
on defense, right?
It's unbelievable.

769
00:32:58,425 --> 00:33:00,452
Okay. What?

770
00:33:01,569 --> 00:33:02,547
Oh, what's what?

771
00:33:02,582 --> 00:33:04,049
Whatever it is
that you've been staring

772
00:33:04,084 --> 00:33:05,550
into space over for days.

773
00:33:05,585 --> 00:33:07,729
I mean, you've said,
like, two words.

774
00:33:07,749 --> 00:33:09,226
Sorry.

775
00:33:10,168 --> 00:33:14,338
Something happened that night
at Rachel's party, didn't it?

776
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,595
I sang a duet with Kurt.

777
00:33:16,629 --> 00:33:18,563
It was Rachel's idea, okay?

778
00:33:18,598 --> 00:33:20,366
It was, uh...
It was a silly glee club thing.

779
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,934
I don't even know why I
haven't told you about it.

780
00:33:22,969 --> 00:33:25,977
Why would I be upset
that you sang a duet with Kurt?

781
00:33:25,997 --> 00:33:28,951
You guys don't stop singing.
That's not it.

782
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,927
Oh, man.

783
00:33:34,547 --> 00:33:36,091
Dave...

784
00:33:36,111 --> 00:33:38,159
Just tell me one thing.

785
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:42,687
Did he kiss you,
or did you kiss him?

786
00:33:47,705 --> 00:33:49,194
I knew it.

787
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:52,096
(Laughs)

788
00:33:52,557 --> 00:33:54,332
(Sighs)

789
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:57,861
Well... guess I was lucky enough

790
00:33:57,881 --> 00:34:00,107
to get a couple of months
in with you, huh?

791
00:34:00,127 --> 00:34:02,740
- What does that mean?
- It means you still love him.

792
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:04,808
You never stopped.

793
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:07,077
Ever since Kurt came back
to Lima,

794
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:09,246
there's been this ticking clock
hanging over us.

795
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,415
Time's up.

796
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:14,018
I'm sorry, Dave. I-I didn't...
I didn't mean to...

797
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,319
It's okay. It's okay. I know.

798
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,689
Hey...

799
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,358
No hard feelings, okay?

800
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:24,662
And you know that clumsy,
fat-ass Craig?

801
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:27,831
He tried to slip me
his number at the game.

802
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:29,432
(Laughs)

803
00:34:29,466 --> 00:34:31,434
Look, there's a whole world

804
00:34:31,468 --> 00:34:34,503
of guys out there
waiting to be my rebound.

805
00:34:34,538 --> 00:34:37,306
Go.

806
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,769
It's okay. Go. Tell Kurt.

807
00:34:44,748 --> 00:34:47,042
Uh, just do me a favor?

808
00:34:48,568 --> 00:34:50,453
Don't sing it.

809
00:34:51,186 --> 00:34:52,849
Just say it.

810
00:35:27,489 --> 00:35:28,869
Oh. Hi, Blaine.

811
00:35:28,889 --> 00:35:30,705
Uh, we were just leaving.

812
00:35:31,673 --> 00:35:33,907
Oh, Walter, this is Blaine.

813
00:35:34,192 --> 00:35:36,078
Ah. Of course.

814
00:35:36,112 --> 00:35:37,474
(Chuckles) The Blaine.

815
00:35:37,494 --> 00:35:39,982
Always nice to put
a face to the name.

816
00:35:40,016 --> 00:35:42,051
Ooh. Neat bowtie.

817
00:35:43,629 --> 00:35:46,021
I'm sorry.
Were you looking for me?

818
00:35:46,056 --> 00:35:48,538
No. Uh, I was just looking
for Rachel.

819
00:35:48,558 --> 00:35:50,192
I-I wanted
to tell her something.

820
00:35:50,226 --> 00:35:51,627
Oh, hey, Blaine.

821
00:35:51,662 --> 00:35:53,028
Did you want to
ask me something?

822
00:35:53,062 --> 00:35:54,996
Uh, wh-where's everybody going?

823
00:35:55,031 --> 00:35:56,765
Oh, we're going
on a double date.

824
00:35:56,799 --> 00:35:58,867
Walter and I have
a shared love for musical flops.

825
00:35:58,901 --> 00:36:01,202
Oh, yeah. And Walter
and I had this mutual love

826
00:36:01,236 --> 00:36:02,971
for the delicious chicken parm
dipping balls

827
00:36:03,005 --> 00:36:04,338
they got at Breadstix.

828
00:36:04,373 --> 00:36:05,607
Oh, my gosh,
they're so delicious.

829
00:36:05,641 --> 00:36:07,108
Well, next time, maybe
you can bring Karofsky,

830
00:36:07,142 --> 00:36:09,510
and we'll triple date it.

831
00:36:09,545 --> 00:36:12,365
Oh, hey, did you want
to ask me something.

832
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,050
You know what? I forgot.

833
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,105
Okay.

834
00:36:25,144 --> 00:36:27,469
Okay, here's my plan.
We're gonna go backstage

835
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:30,061
where I have left two
boxes of k-y jelly tubes.

836
00:36:30,081 --> 00:36:31,982
All right? Everyone grab a tube

837
00:36:32,016 --> 00:36:35,275
and squirt out every last drop
onto the stage floor.

838
00:36:35,295 --> 00:36:38,005
All right, everyone, huddle up.

839
00:36:38,025 --> 00:36:40,991
We're gonna watch those fools literally
fall on their faces.

840
00:36:41,025 --> 00:36:42,292
(Laughter)

841
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:44,694

Yes!

890
00:39:51,241 --> 00:39:53,342
Clint: I knew you
were full of crap.

891
00:39:53,376 --> 00:39:55,511
Your little "kum-bah-yah"
lesson here cost us two hours

892
00:39:55,545 --> 00:39:57,212
of valuable rehearsal
time, and you can bet

893
00:39:57,247 --> 00:40:00,116
the booster association
is gonna hear about it.

894
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,684
You know, I started teaching
glee club

895
00:40:01,718 --> 00:40:03,552
because I care about the arts.

896
00:40:03,586 --> 00:40:05,955
And that means a lot more
than just practicing 24/7

897
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:07,722
like militant robots.

898
00:40:07,757 --> 00:40:10,158
It means finding
yourself in the music,

899
00:40:10,192 --> 00:40:12,961
and sometimes it means taking a
week off of sectionals practice

900
00:40:12,995 --> 00:40:15,797
to do something
to make your friend feel good.

901
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:17,899
At least that's what it meant
when I worked at McKinley.

902
00:40:17,933 --> 00:40:20,201
And I'm not willing
to sacrifice that anymore.

903
00:40:20,235 --> 00:40:22,303
So if you guys want to continue

904
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:25,206
to be intolerant
trouble-makers, go for it,

905
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,376
because I quit.

906
00:40:30,212 --> 00:40:32,180
You can't do that, Will.

907
00:40:32,214 --> 00:40:34,415
Oh, I just did,
and it's not because of you.

908
00:40:34,449 --> 00:40:36,750
It's because
Unique came to me, and

909
00:40:36,785 --> 00:40:39,654
we spent all week gathering
this transgender choir,

910
00:40:39,688 --> 00:40:41,422
300 voices strong

911
00:40:41,456 --> 00:40:44,758
to make you feel welcomed
and at home.

912
00:40:47,396 --> 00:40:49,530
(Horn toots, microphone squeaks)

913
00:40:49,565 --> 00:40:52,433
Attention Vocal Adrenaline
members,

914
00:40:52,467 --> 00:40:55,002
I will give you six minutes
to leave campus

915
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,071
before I unleash my hounds.

916
00:40:57,105 --> 00:40:59,373
Also, I've slashed
all the tires on your bus

917
00:40:59,408 --> 00:41:01,008
so you'll have to walk home.

918
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:04,511
Perhaps you can use
this march of death opportunity

919
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:07,780
to consider how awful
you really are.

920
00:41:07,815 --> 00:41:10,650
(Dogs barking)

921
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:19,392
So what are you gonna do now?

922
00:41:19,427 --> 00:41:21,228
I don't know.

923
00:41:21,262 --> 00:41:24,264
I mean, I guess I have
to eventually find a new job,

924
00:41:24,298 --> 00:41:26,466
but, honestly,
Carmel paid so well

925
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,134
that we have enough savings
to last a few months,

926
00:41:29,168 --> 00:41:31,570
so I can figure things out.

927
00:41:31,605 --> 00:41:34,005
(Sighs)

928
00:41:35,481 --> 00:41:39,278
I am honestly so proud of
what you guys are doing here.

929
00:41:39,312 --> 00:41:43,282
And if I ever doubted that there
needed to be somebody out there

930
00:41:43,316 --> 00:41:45,917
to balance out the evil
empire of Vocal Adrenaline,

931
00:41:45,952 --> 00:41:48,101
I am a true believer now.

932
00:41:49,321 --> 00:41:51,656
Well, there is a job.

933
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:53,558
It doesn't really pay much.

934
00:41:53,592 --> 00:41:55,593
Actually, it doesn't
pay anything at all,

935
00:41:55,628 --> 00:41:57,896
but, well, Kurt
and I were wondering

936
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:00,999
if-if you had the time, or
if you would even consider

937
00:42:01,033 --> 00:42:03,601
being the special
alumni consultant

938
00:42:03,636 --> 00:42:05,403
for the New Directions!?

939
00:42:05,437 --> 00:42:07,572
Did you just make up
that title right now?

940
00:42:07,606 --> 00:42:08,940
Yes, I just made
that up right now.

941
00:42:08,975 --> 00:42:10,641
I absolutely did.

942
00:42:10,675 --> 00:42:13,310
But Kurt and I were talking, and
we could really use your help.

943
00:42:13,344 --> 00:42:14,845
Coming up with these
weekly lessons

944
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,019
is a lot harder than we thought.

945
00:42:17,354 --> 00:42:18,649
Okay.

946
00:42:18,683 --> 00:42:21,986
Okay, as in,
you'll think about it?

947
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:25,589
No. Okay, as in,
I would be honored to help.

948
00:42:25,623 --> 00:42:27,357
That's great. (Laughs)

949
00:42:27,392 --> 00:42:30,527
But I have, uh, two conditions.

950
00:42:30,561 --> 00:42:33,697
One... you guys have to make all
of the major decisions.

951
00:42:33,731 --> 00:42:36,166
And two... you both have
to start calling me Will.

952
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,601
Yes, I can definitely do that.

953
00:42:37,635 --> 00:42:39,303
Kurt: No. I don't think

954
00:42:39,337 --> 00:42:41,805
I could ever call you "Will." That...
no. (Laughs)

955
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:43,640
- I...
- Ah. I mean,

956
00:42:43,675 --> 00:42:46,209
you guys are just passing
through this place again,

957
00:42:46,243 --> 00:42:49,946
but I'm beginning to realize
that this is where I belong.

958
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,348
This choir room is who I am.

959
00:42:51,382 --> 00:42:53,517
And I can't wait to see the look

960
00:42:53,551 --> 00:42:55,017
on Sue's face when I tell her.
(Laughs)

961
00:42:55,051 --> 00:42:56,552
So, what's the lesson
for next week?

962
00:42:56,586 --> 00:42:58,487
Well, Kurt wants to do another
Britney 3.0,

963
00:42:58,522 --> 00:43:00,523
but, honestly, there's no more
songs left in her catalog.

964
00:43:00,557 --> 00:43:02,792
Tons of songs. Well, do the kids
have any personal problems?

965
00:43:02,826 --> 00:43:04,393
We don't really know.

966
00:43:04,428 --> 00:43:05,795
We don't spend too much
time talking to them.

967
00:43:05,829 --> 00:43:07,663
Well, you should.
Get to know them.

968
00:43:07,698 --> 00:43:12,634
Because one day, they may be the
best friends you've ever had.
