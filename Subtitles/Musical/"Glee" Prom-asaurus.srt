1
00:00:01,349 --> 00:00:02,883
<i>So here's what you missed
on</i> Glee:

2
00:00:02,934 --> 00:00:04,885
<i>Rachel choked at her NYADA
audition, which meant she blew</i>

3
00:00:04,886 --> 00:00:06,270
<i>the biggest audition of her life.</i>
Oh, God.

4
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:07,805
<i>Which, as far as
she's concerned, is now</i>

5
00:00:07,806 --> 00:00:09,423
<i>pretty much over.</i>
I had my chance and I choked.

6
00:00:09,424 --> 00:00:11,108
<i>Quinn's in a wheelchair,
but her rehab's going well,</i>

7
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:12,560
<i>partly because Joe's been
going with her.</i>

8
00:00:12,561 --> 00:00:13,644
<i>Brittany probably
forgot she was</i>

9
00:00:13,645 --> 00:00:14,945
<i>elected senior class president.</i>

10
00:00:14,946 --> 00:00:16,363
<i>And Puck failed
his big geography exam</i>

11
00:00:16,364 --> 00:00:18,399
<i>about Iberian precipitation,</i>

12
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,766
<i>which means
he's not gonna graduate.</i>

13
00:00:19,767 --> 00:00:20,934
<i>And that's what you missed
on</i> Glee.

14
00:00:23,722 --> 00:00:24,889
RACHEL:
<i>Everything dies.</i>

15
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,124
<i>Maybe the saddest death of all</i>

16
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:28,742
<i>is the death of a dream.</i>

17
00:00:28,743 --> 00:00:32,796
<i>For 18 years, I've had
one dream: Broadway, stardom.</i>

18
00:00:32,797 --> 00:00:36,500
<i>It was like wings that kept me
hovering above the fray.</i>

19
00:00:36,585 --> 00:00:39,119
<i>But I flew too close to the sun
and now they're gone</i>

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,473
<i>and I'm just Rachel
Barbra Berry of Lima, Ohio...</i>

21
00:00:42,474 --> 00:00:44,291
<i>a flightless bird.</i>

22
00:00:44,292 --> 00:00:46,126
<i>A penguin.</i>

23
00:00:46,127 --> 00:00:47,511
<i>Do I look different?</i>

24
00:00:47,512 --> 00:00:49,180
<i>I feel different.</i>

25
00:00:49,181 --> 00:00:52,933
<i>In some ways, it's a relief...
to be part of the crowd.</i>

26
00:00:52,934 --> 00:00:56,187
<i>My dreams are smaller now,
maybe even more real...</i>

27
00:00:56,188 --> 00:01:00,357
<i>the wedding, winning
Nationals... but first, prom.</i>

28
00:01:00,358 --> 00:01:02,276
<i>I'll never walk the red carpet</i>

29
00:01:02,327 --> 00:01:04,528
<i>as a Tony
or Golden Globe nominee.</i>

30
00:01:04,529 --> 00:01:06,614
<i>That's what you get
for having no backup plan.</i>

31
00:01:06,615 --> 00:01:08,982
<i>Prom is my night
to trip the light fantastic.</i>

32
00:01:08,983 --> 00:01:11,035
<i>Next to my wedding,
my prom dress will be</i>

33
00:01:11,036 --> 00:01:13,687
<i>the most important gown
I ever wear.</i>

34
00:01:13,688 --> 00:01:15,756
<i>I'm surprisingly
okay with it all.</i>

35
00:01:15,757 --> 00:01:18,325
<i>That dream was just a favorite
old sweater that I kept around</i>

36
00:01:18,326 --> 00:01:19,927
<i>even though
it didn't fit anymore.</i>

37
00:01:19,928 --> 00:01:21,749
<i>I can grieve it and move on.</i>

38
00:01:21,796 --> 00:01:25,182
<i>I may have lost NYADA,
but I still have Finn.</i>

39
00:01:25,183 --> 00:01:26,767
<i>So I'm not going to get</i>

40
00:01:26,768 --> 00:01:28,335
<i>everything I thought
I ever wanted.</i>

41
00:01:28,336 --> 00:01:29,637
<i>Doesn't make me a loser.</i>

42
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:34,692
What are you doing?

43
00:01:34,693 --> 00:01:37,444
I am practicing my Prom
Queen victory wave.

44
00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:39,063
I'm going to win.

45
00:01:39,064 --> 00:01:41,515
You know, there's a lot of stiff
competition this year, Becky.

46
00:01:41,516 --> 00:01:43,103
I wouldn't want you
to be disappointed.

47
00:01:43,151 --> 00:01:46,120
Would you mind taking your
loser talk somewhere else?

48
00:01:46,121 --> 00:01:48,072
I don't want to
catch your failure.

49
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,582
(school bell ringing)

50
00:01:58,583 --> 00:01:59,967
Sexy teen trollop.

51
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:01,168
Many months ago,

52
00:02:01,169 --> 00:02:02,369
to much fanfare,

53
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,999
you were elected
senior class president.

54
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:05,960
Oh, yeah.
Since that day,

55
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:08,542
you have accomplished nothing
except one memorandum

56
00:02:08,543 --> 00:02:10,010
written in crayon saying

57
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:11,465
"Drill, baby, drill."

58
00:02:11,513 --> 00:02:13,551
Yeah, I no longer believe we
should be drilling for babies.

59
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,551
Your do-nothing presidency
has me seriously considering

60
00:02:17,552 --> 00:02:18,973
abolishing the post
altogether.

61
00:02:18,987 --> 00:02:20,554
And as you are flunking
each of your classes,

62
00:02:20,555 --> 00:02:22,606
you need class president

63
00:02:22,607 --> 00:02:26,146
on your transcript if you hope
to gain admittance into college.

64
00:02:26,194 --> 00:02:27,995
No, I don't. I've already
been accepted at Perdue.

65
00:02:27,996 --> 00:02:29,446
The university?

66
00:02:29,447 --> 00:02:31,098
No, the chicken factory.

67
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:34,368
Miss Pierce,
you are making a mockery

68
00:02:34,369 --> 00:02:35,906
of this student government,

69
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,072
and if you don't make an impact
with the rest of your term,

70
00:02:39,073 --> 00:02:42,092
your presidency will be
this school's last!

71
00:02:42,093 --> 00:02:45,512
I now realize I wasted an entire
year belaboring the nuances

72
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:48,210
of my fluid teen sexuality
and getting caught up

73
00:02:48,216 --> 00:02:49,850
in Lord Tubbington's
Ponzi schemes.

74
00:02:49,851 --> 00:02:51,802
Then for a while,
I stopped talking.

75
00:02:51,803 --> 00:02:54,471
But I don't want my presidency
to be the last one at McKinley.

76
00:02:54,472 --> 00:02:56,176
I don't want that
to be my legacy.

77
00:02:56,191 --> 00:02:58,470
Well, Madame President,
prom is coming up.

78
00:02:58,526 --> 00:03:01,807
And if you want to
rehabilitate your image,

79
00:03:01,863 --> 00:03:03,697
perhaps that's where
you should start.

80
00:03:04,783 --> 00:03:05,983
(school bell ringing)

81
00:03:05,984 --> 00:03:07,146
Okay.

82
00:03:07,202 --> 00:03:10,204
I don't know
who any of you guys are.

83
00:03:10,205 --> 00:03:11,938
Oh, we're
the Prom Committee.

84
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:14,441
We've been meeting
since September.

85
00:03:14,442 --> 00:03:16,280
We've sent
you 14 memos.

86
00:03:16,328 --> 00:03:18,579
Did you get my memo
about drilling for babies?

87
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,380
No.

88
00:03:19,381 --> 00:03:20,547
Good. 'Cause that's not

89
00:03:20,548 --> 00:03:21,799
the solution
to soaring gas prices.

90
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,051
We're a little behind schedule,

91
00:03:24,052 --> 00:03:26,837
but we think we have a great
theme for this year's prom.

92
00:03:26,921 --> 00:03:28,417
Cool.
This year's prom theme

93
00:03:28,456 --> 00:03:31,592
is...
(humming fanfare)

94
00:03:31,593 --> 00:03:32,976
"Castles in the Clouds."

95
00:03:34,262 --> 00:03:36,013
Nice.

96
00:03:36,014 --> 00:03:37,631
I like your unicorns;
Those are great.

97
00:03:37,632 --> 00:03:39,633
But I'm gonna have to say never,

98
00:03:39,634 --> 00:03:41,568
'cause there's no way
I'm ever gonna let that happen.

99
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:42,903
Castles are very heavy,

100
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,305
so putting them on clouds
would be extremely dangerous.

101
00:03:45,306 --> 00:03:47,307
I seriously think the three of
you should be put in jail.

102
00:03:47,308 --> 00:03:48,437
Okay.

103
00:03:48,443 --> 00:03:52,579
Um, what about...
"Stairway to Heaven"?

104
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,147
Not unless we also build

105
00:03:54,148 --> 00:03:55,916
escalators to heaven
for the disabled students.

106
00:03:55,917 --> 00:03:57,446
Plus, I'm not

107
00:03:57,485 --> 00:03:59,152
really sure if they're even
allowed into heaven.

108
00:03:59,153 --> 00:04:02,039
It's clear that the three of you
are incompetent fools,

109
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,507
possibly some sort
of terrorist cell.

110
00:04:03,508 --> 00:04:06,260
So, as president,
I'm gonna decide

111
00:04:06,261 --> 00:04:08,874
what the prom theme
is going to be this year.

112
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,932
And I think...
that it should be...

113
00:04:12,967 --> 00:04:14,218
"Dinosaurs."

114
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:15,335
Dinosaurs?!

115
00:04:15,336 --> 00:04:16,837
Yeah.

116
00:04:16,838 --> 00:04:19,273
The Bible told me that dinosaurs
and cavemen lived side by side

117
00:04:19,274 --> 00:04:20,474
for millions of years
in peace,

118
00:04:20,475 --> 00:04:21,608
and I think that's something

119
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:22,680
that we should
totally celebrate.

120
00:04:22,694 --> 00:04:24,723
No, you can't
be serious.

121
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:26,725
That's the worst
prom theme ever.

122
00:04:26,781 --> 00:04:30,117
When you insult my dinosaur
prom theme, that's bullying,

123
00:04:30,118 --> 00:04:31,618
and I will not accept it.

124
00:04:31,619 --> 00:04:34,955
By the power vested in me
as president, you are all fired.

125
00:04:34,956 --> 00:04:35,856
Sorry, Rachel,
that includes you.

126
00:04:35,857 --> 00:04:36,990
But I guess

127
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,293
I'll see you in Glee Club, so...

128
00:04:39,294 --> 00:04:40,744
Good meeting, guys.

129
00:04:40,745 --> 00:04:41,744
(school bell ringing)

130
00:04:47,168 --> 00:04:48,664
Good morning,
McKinley High!

131
00:04:48,703 --> 00:04:50,874
First of all, to those of you
thoughtful enough to leave

132
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:52,626
maternity gifts
outside my office,

133
00:04:52,674 --> 00:04:54,708
both I and my unborn child
thank you

134
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:56,443
for your lackluster Cracker
Barrel meat-and-cheese medleys,

135
00:04:56,444 --> 00:04:58,173
and I'm sure that

136
00:04:58,212 --> 00:05:00,264
my trash can
will find them delicious.

137
00:05:00,265 --> 00:05:02,302
Now it's time

138
00:05:02,317 --> 00:05:05,889
to announce this year's
Senior Prom Court nominees.

139
00:05:05,937 --> 00:05:08,605
Your choices
for Prom King are...

140
00:05:08,606 --> 00:05:10,018
Rick "The Stick" Nelson.

141
00:05:10,057 --> 00:05:11,391
Yeah!
(whooping)

142
00:05:11,392 --> 00:05:13,277
You know this!

143
00:05:13,278 --> 00:05:15,529
President Brittany S. Pierce.

144
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,498
That's weird.

145
00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:19,653
And also, Finn Hudson.

146
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:22,903
And now on to the category
we all really care about:

147
00:05:22,904 --> 00:05:24,237
Prom Queen.

148
00:05:24,238 --> 00:05:27,207
Becky for Prom Queen 2012!

149
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,793
Missy Gunderson.

150
00:05:29,794 --> 00:05:32,095
(cheering)

151
00:05:32,096 --> 00:05:34,715
Santana Lopez.

152
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:38,852
And Quinn Fabray.

153
00:05:38,853 --> 00:05:40,591
Congratulations to
all our nominees...

154
00:05:40,605 --> 00:05:42,301
(xylophone clattering,
static crackling)

155
00:05:42,357 --> 00:05:43,640
Becky, Becky, Becky!
That's an antique!

156
00:05:43,641 --> 00:05:45,526
I was robbed, Coach!

157
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:49,224
(school bell ringing)

158
00:05:49,263 --> 00:05:51,482
So are you bummed you didn't
get nominated for Prom Queen?

159
00:05:51,483 --> 00:05:53,450
In what world would I ever be
nominated for Prom Queen?

160
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:54,618
Well, I voted for you.

161
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:55,786
And I got that
crossed-eyed dude

162
00:05:55,787 --> 00:05:57,454
in my study hall
to vote for you, too.

163
00:05:57,455 --> 00:05:59,540
That's very sweet of you, but
I'm not upset at all actually,

164
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,658
because I am gonna be
spending my entire prom night

165
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:04,661
dancing with my devastatingly
handsome future husband to be.

166
00:06:04,662 --> 00:06:06,079
We'll make your posters
later, okay?

167
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,347
WILL:
Okay!

168
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:10,984
A big congrats to all
our prom nominees!

169
00:06:10,985 --> 00:06:13,070
(applause)

170
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:14,688
But, hey, listen up.

171
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:16,039
We are all winners,

172
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,045
because
Principal Figgins

173
00:06:18,076 --> 00:06:20,210
asked New Directions
to sing again this year!

174
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:21,461
Come on!

175
00:06:21,462 --> 00:06:23,297
(cheering)

176
00:06:23,298 --> 00:06:24,081
Fantastic.

177
00:06:24,082 --> 00:06:25,582
All right.

178
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:26,800
Brittany has an
announcement.

179
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:29,202
(scattered applause)

180
00:06:29,203 --> 00:06:30,921
Hello, my fellow Americans.

181
00:06:30,922 --> 00:06:34,141
The theme for this year's prom
will be...

182
00:06:34,142 --> 00:06:35,475
(feet drumming)

183
00:06:35,476 --> 00:06:36,510
"Dinosaurs."

184
00:06:36,511 --> 00:06:37,510
Sheer genius.

185
00:06:37,512 --> 00:06:39,149
BRITTANY:
Thanks.

186
00:06:39,213 --> 00:06:40,901
I was inspired by
the new girl Joe,

187
00:06:40,932 --> 00:06:42,653
who reminds me
of a cavewoman.

188
00:06:42,717 --> 00:06:44,151
The refreshments
will be berries,

189
00:06:44,152 --> 00:06:45,435
meat and rainwater.

190
00:06:45,436 --> 00:06:46,907
As you are no
doubt aware,

191
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:48,283
the U.S. elections are
riddled with corruption.

192
00:06:48,323 --> 00:06:49,993
Therefore, to keep
the prom elections

193
00:06:50,057 --> 00:06:51,942
completely aboveboard,
I have appointed Santana

194
00:06:51,943 --> 00:06:53,727
and Quinn to count the ballots.

195
00:06:53,728 --> 00:06:55,112
What? That makes no sense!

196
00:06:55,113 --> 00:06:56,563
Shut it, Richard Simmons.

197
00:06:56,614 --> 00:06:57,835
Yes, Quinn's my homegirl,
but I don't trust her,

198
00:06:57,899 --> 00:06:59,566
and you know she doesn't
trust me.

199
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:00,534
We'll keep each other honest.

200
00:07:00,535 --> 00:07:01,713
MERCEDES:
You know,

201
00:07:01,736 --> 00:07:02,920
It's actually
not a bad idea.

202
00:07:02,921 --> 00:07:04,204
BRITTANY:
And last but not least,

203
00:07:04,255 --> 00:07:06,740
all hair gel has been
banned from the prom.

204
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:08,241
(laughs)
Right.

205
00:07:08,242 --> 00:07:09,596
I'm actually not joking.

206
00:07:09,627 --> 00:07:11,181
Hair gel was not
invented until

207
00:07:11,212 --> 00:07:13,881
almost 30 million years after
the Upper Paleolithic Stone Age.

208
00:07:13,882 --> 00:07:14,948
And frankly,

209
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:16,082
I don't like the way you look.

210
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,980
Therefore, anyone who

211
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:19,857
shows up to prom
wearing hair gel will be

212
00:07:19,888 --> 00:07:21,254
turned away
at the door.

213
00:07:21,255 --> 00:07:24,224
I hereby decree this
to be the best prom

214
00:07:24,225 --> 00:07:25,809
(whispers):
Ever.

215
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,694
Okay.

216
00:07:27,695 --> 00:07:30,931
Let's start thinking
of... dinosaur songs.

217
00:07:30,932 --> 00:07:32,933
(clapping)

218
00:07:32,934 --> 00:07:33,996
(school bell ringing)

219
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:47,384
Hey, did you
know about this?

220
00:07:47,415 --> 00:07:49,049
I know you knew about
this 'cause it was hung

221
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,637
at eye level and I know
Quinn couldn't reach up

222
00:07:50,718 --> 00:07:51,952
that high to put it there.
Whoa, whoa.

223
00:07:51,953 --> 00:07:53,453
Remember when I told you
that if you come at me

224
00:07:53,454 --> 00:07:55,305
with the crazy right off the bat
that my head goes all empty

225
00:07:55,306 --> 00:07:56,673
and I can't really have
a productive conversation?

226
00:07:56,674 --> 00:07:58,124
This isn't crazy,
this is mad, this is hurt.

227
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,726
This isn't a big deal.
Not a big deal?

228
00:07:59,727 --> 00:08:02,128
I'm gonna have to watch my
fiancé dance in front of

229
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:04,598
the entire school with his
ex-girlfriend at my senior prom.

230
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:07,067
If you haven't noticed,
Quinn can't dance.

231
00:08:07,068 --> 00:08:09,152
She just about died
coming to our wedding.

232
00:08:09,153 --> 00:08:10,971
She asked me if I would
campaign with her,

233
00:08:10,972 --> 00:08:13,607
and I figured it was the least
I could do for our friend.

234
00:08:13,608 --> 00:08:15,025
I can't believe
how selfish you're being.

235
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:16,243
Yeah, well,
if you haven't noticed,

236
00:08:16,244 --> 00:08:17,361
I'm kind of having
a bad week myself.

237
00:08:19,247 --> 00:08:21,615
I can't believe that my entire
high school career is gonna end

238
00:08:21,616 --> 00:08:24,284
the exact same way it started...
just some sad little Jewish girl

239
00:08:24,285 --> 00:08:25,702
watching you get
all the attention

240
00:08:25,703 --> 00:08:27,424
with the pretty blonde cheerleader.
Oh...

241
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,791
(school bell ringing)

242
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:34,430
JOE:
Come on.

243
00:08:38,673 --> 00:08:39,941
Good, good, good.
Come on.

244
00:08:39,942 --> 00:08:42,009
All right, now let go
of your hands.

245
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,311
You got this.
Just-just let go.

246
00:08:43,312 --> 00:08:44,483
I promise you'll be okay.

247
00:08:46,315 --> 00:08:48,182
You got it.

248
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:49,850
Good.

249
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:50,985
Come on.

250
00:08:51,036 --> 00:08:53,287
This is all you.
Look at you.

251
00:08:53,288 --> 00:08:54,489
You have it.
Just-just...

252
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,656
No-no-no-no-no!
(grunts)

253
00:08:55,657 --> 00:08:56,958
Are you okay?

254
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,526
Yeah, I'm okay.
I knew you could do it.

255
00:08:58,577 --> 00:08:59,494
That was fantastic.

256
00:08:59,545 --> 00:09:00,628
You're amazing.

257
00:09:00,629 --> 00:09:03,915
Thank you for always
coming with me.

258
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,199
Totally selfish.

259
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,588
I get to hang with you.

260
00:09:06,668 --> 00:09:08,002
(sighs)

261
00:09:08,003 --> 00:09:09,504
Take a break, then
let's show everyone.

262
00:09:09,505 --> 00:09:10,504
Glee and...

263
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:11,839
No, no.

264
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,141
Why? This is huge.

265
00:09:13,142 --> 00:09:15,143
Because it has to be real.

266
00:09:15,144 --> 00:09:18,096
I mean...

267
00:09:18,097 --> 00:09:19,847
you know, maybe if
I practiced a lot,

268
00:09:19,848 --> 00:09:21,770
I could walk
into the choir room.

269
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,351
Or even prom.

270
00:09:23,402 --> 00:09:24,685
So until then,

271
00:09:24,736 --> 00:09:28,322
just promise me
you won't tell anybody.

272
00:09:28,323 --> 00:09:30,525
You're gonna be
dancing at prom.

273
00:09:30,526 --> 00:09:31,571
I know it.

274
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,363
(school bell ringing)

275
00:09:35,364 --> 00:09:38,032
BECKY:
<i>I, Becky Faye Jackson,</i>

276
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:42,837
<i>was born to be Queen,
but my crown has been stolen.</i>

277
00:09:42,838 --> 00:09:45,756
<i>Queens don't always have to
look the same, you know.</i>

278
00:09:45,757 --> 00:09:47,758
<i>Sometimes they look different.</i>

279
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:50,244
<i>Sometimes they're shorter.</i>

280
00:09:50,245 --> 00:09:51,429
<i>Or wear glasses.</i>

281
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:57,685
<i>What are you smiling about,
poster-people?</i>

282
00:09:57,686 --> 00:09:59,887
<i>And stop staring at me!</i>

283
00:09:59,888 --> 00:10:03,724
<i>It's not fun to be stared at.</i>

284
00:10:03,725 --> 00:10:04,925
(school bell ringing)

285
00:10:04,977 --> 00:10:08,029
Becky, I understand
you're upset,

286
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:11,115
but this scorched earth reign
of terror must come to an end.

287
00:10:11,116 --> 00:10:13,530
First, you declared
war on xylophones.

288
00:10:14,786 --> 00:10:16,770
(yells)

289
00:10:16,822 --> 00:10:19,207
Then, you ransacked
the cafeteria line.

290
00:10:23,495 --> 00:10:24,912
(growling)

291
00:10:24,913 --> 00:10:27,281
But, Coach,
I want to be Prom Queen,

292
00:10:27,282 --> 00:10:29,250
just like I just saw
in that commercial.

293
00:10:29,251 --> 00:10:31,619
Oh, Becky, commercials
aren't real life.

294
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,504
Advertisers are
manipulative alcoholics

295
00:10:33,505 --> 00:10:35,590
who use images to
play on our emotions.

296
00:10:35,591 --> 00:10:36,757
Haven't you
seen <i>Mad Men?</i>

297
00:10:36,808 --> 00:10:38,125
No.

298
00:10:38,126 --> 00:10:39,260
Neither have I.

299
00:10:39,261 --> 00:10:41,629
Becky, let's
be realistic:

300
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,981
You just didn't have the votes.

301
00:10:43,982 --> 00:10:47,518
For starters, your posters
sent a bit of a mixed message.

302
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,605
But my paintbrush doesn't
have spell check, Coach.

303
00:10:50,606 --> 00:10:54,141
And second... and I mean this
as a compliment...

304
00:10:54,142 --> 00:10:55,493
you're a bitch, Becky.

305
00:10:56,778 --> 00:10:57,945
With a bad attitude.

306
00:10:57,996 --> 00:10:59,263
And honestly,

307
00:10:59,264 --> 00:11:00,164
with Quinn Fabray
in a wheelchair,

308
00:11:00,165 --> 00:11:01,282
the sympathy vote was split.

309
00:11:01,283 --> 00:11:02,867
But here's the
goods.

310
00:11:02,951 --> 00:11:05,086
You're coming to prom with me,
Becky Jackson,

311
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,987
where I'm making you
deputy in charge

312
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,623
of guarding the
punch bowl.

313
00:11:08,674 --> 00:11:10,041
Chin up, Jackson.

314
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,210
And please be
careful walking

315
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:13,844
past my brand-new
xylophone.

316
00:11:13,845 --> 00:11:15,213
(grunts)

317
00:11:15,214 --> 00:11:16,631
That's the attitude
right there, Becky.

318
00:11:16,632 --> 00:11:17,765
(school bell ringing)

319
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,233

00:13:32,534 --> 00:13:34,368
'Cause I love that song,

354
00:13:34,369 --> 00:13:36,253
but it's sort of a downer,
don't you think?

355
00:13:36,254 --> 00:13:38,089
It's just how I'm feeling
right now, okay?

356
00:13:38,173 --> 00:13:39,924
I don't want to watch
Finn and Quinn

357
00:13:39,925 --> 00:13:41,726
get crowned the king
and queen at my prom.

358
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,929
I don't want to watch him
dance with her.

359
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:45,825
I-I know that
she can't

360
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,214
really dance anymore, but...

361
00:13:47,215 --> 00:13:49,266
I'm sorry. You know...
you know what I mean.

362
00:13:49,351 --> 00:13:50,685
She's right.

363
00:13:50,686 --> 00:13:52,052
Prom sucks.
Yeah.

364
00:13:52,053 --> 00:13:53,875
I don't want to go, either.
Well, you have to go.

365
00:13:53,905 --> 00:13:55,055
You're the reigning prom queen.

366
00:13:55,056 --> 00:13:56,323
You have to crown the next one.

367
00:13:56,324 --> 00:13:58,025
As much as I love
a good coronation,

368
00:13:58,076 --> 00:13:59,193
I can't risk it.

369
00:13:59,244 --> 00:14:00,361
With this school's

370
00:14:00,412 --> 00:14:01,612
strong and
insane tradition

371
00:14:01,613 --> 00:14:03,114
of write-in ballots,
I could get

372
00:14:03,115 --> 00:14:05,095
elected prom queen
again, all right?

373
00:14:05,117 --> 00:14:06,450
And I know I put on

374
00:14:06,451 --> 00:14:08,869
a brave face last year,
but it was humiliating.

375
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,955
And, had I known, I would have
worn a full kilt, so...

376
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:12,173
How do you
think I feel

377
00:14:12,174 --> 00:14:13,907
with Brittany's
insane ban on hair gel?

378
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:16,343
It's prom. There's going to be
balloons all over the place,

379
00:14:16,411 --> 00:14:19,046
not to mention the taffeta
and the silk blends.

380
00:14:19,047 --> 00:14:20,464
The sheer amount
of static electricity

381
00:14:20,465 --> 00:14:22,433
in that room
is going to be terrifying.

382
00:14:22,434 --> 00:14:24,552
It's crazy.
You've never seen my hair

383
00:14:24,553 --> 00:14:26,554
without gel...
it's-it's baby-hair fine.

384
00:14:26,605 --> 00:14:28,472
No, it... I'm going
to look like Medusa.

385
00:14:28,473 --> 00:14:30,274
It's not funny.
I don't want to go.

386
00:14:30,275 --> 00:14:32,026
KURT: Well, if we're
all going to be

387
00:14:32,027 --> 00:14:34,695
so miserable about it,
who says we have to go?

388
00:14:34,763 --> 00:14:36,280
You're right, Kurt.

389
00:14:36,281 --> 00:14:37,982
But I have a better idea.

390
00:14:37,983 --> 00:14:39,713
So Kurt and Blaine
and I are throwing

391
00:14:39,768 --> 00:14:40,701
an anti-prom party.

392
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:42,486
What's an anti-prom party?

393
00:14:42,487 --> 00:14:43,988
It's a party
for those of us

394
00:14:43,989 --> 00:14:45,489
who maybe feel a
little, you know,

395
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,940
disenfranchised by
the actual prom.

396
00:14:46,992 --> 00:14:49,160
And I got us a hotel room
at Lima's best hotel,

397
00:14:49,244 --> 00:14:51,599
Red Rooster Express Suite,
and everyone's invited.

398
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,663
You're supporting this?

399
00:14:52,748 --> 00:14:53,914
FINN:
I'm supporting her,

400
00:14:53,915 --> 00:14:55,132
and I'll be there

401
00:14:55,133 --> 00:14:57,084
as soon as I'm done
fulfilling my...

402
00:14:57,135 --> 00:14:58,836
obligations.

403
00:14:58,837 --> 00:15:00,337
The mood
will be celebratory,

404
00:15:00,338 --> 00:15:01,889
the food will
be catered,

405
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,424
the libations
will be plentiful,

406
00:15:03,425 --> 00:15:05,843
and the dress code
will be creative black tie.

407
00:15:05,844 --> 00:15:07,478
Optional,
optional, optional.

408
00:15:07,562 --> 00:15:09,563
And keeping up with
the anti-prom theme,

409
00:15:09,564 --> 00:15:10,931
everyone is welcome,
and unlike the actual prom,

410
00:15:10,932 --> 00:15:12,266
which ends at 11:00 p.m.,

411
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:13,901
ours goes until the wee hours
of the night.

412
00:15:13,902 --> 00:15:15,186
It's where the fun's at,
you guys.

413
00:15:15,187 --> 00:15:16,804
Okay, how is everyone welcome
when this is clearly

414
00:15:16,855 --> 00:15:19,406
just a party for you and
the two gay Winklevii twins?

415
00:15:19,474 --> 00:15:20,991
RACHEL: Actually,
Santana, we've invited

416
00:15:20,992 --> 00:15:22,743
most of McKinley's
underclassmen.

417
00:15:22,811 --> 00:15:25,112
I wanted to invite you
to our anti-prom party.

418
00:15:25,113 --> 00:15:26,697
Who's going?
Me, Kurt...

419
00:15:26,698 --> 00:15:28,115
Boring. Who else?

420
00:15:28,116 --> 00:15:29,784
Well, we just came up
with the idea.

421
00:15:29,785 --> 00:15:31,252
I'll think about it.

422
00:15:31,253 --> 00:15:32,870
(school bell ringing)

423
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:34,538
I'm in.
ARTIE: But what about

424
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:35,840
your tradition of trying

425
00:15:35,841 --> 00:15:36,990
to spike Coach Sylvester's
punch bowl?

426
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:38,158
I almost lost
my teeth

427
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:40,377
for it last time.
It's impossible.

428
00:15:40,378 --> 00:15:43,097
Plus it's a bummer,
always failing... at everything.

429
00:15:43,098 --> 00:15:45,099
Can we just talk
about what this really is?

430
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,433
Rachel Berry
isn't getting her way,

431
00:15:46,434 --> 00:15:48,001
so she's punishing
the rest of us.

432
00:15:48,002 --> 00:15:49,403
Santana, that's not
the case at all.

433
00:15:49,471 --> 00:15:50,671
Stop acting like you're fine

434
00:15:50,672 --> 00:15:52,439
and start dealing
with your crap.

435
00:15:52,507 --> 00:15:54,329
Look, you choked
at your big audition.

436
00:15:54,376 --> 00:15:55,342
I get it.

437
00:15:55,393 --> 00:15:57,444
I'm sorry, but it happens.

438
00:15:57,445 --> 00:15:59,680
And I understand that you're
pissed off at the universe,

439
00:15:59,731 --> 00:16:01,232
but imploding on one
of the last nights

440
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:02,700
that we have
to spend together

441
00:16:02,701 --> 00:16:04,902
because, basically, you're just
not in the mood to dance

442
00:16:04,903 --> 00:16:06,854
is maybe the pettiest thing
you have ever done.

443
00:16:06,905 --> 00:16:09,189
So have fun at your
"I'm a victim" party,

444
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,596
acting like you're not
some selfish, self-centered,

445
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,494
lame-ass wannabe diva from hell,

446
00:16:13,495 --> 00:16:16,363
because me, I'm going to go
to my senior prom

447
00:16:16,364 --> 00:16:18,198
with my girlfriend
and my friends.

448
00:16:20,869 --> 00:16:22,920
(school bell ringing)

449
00:16:22,921 --> 00:16:24,922
You can't be too pleased
by that stunt Rachel's pulling.

450
00:16:24,923 --> 00:16:26,874
I'm not, but I kind of
feel bad for her.

451
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,375
She's going through a
lot of rough stuff.

452
00:16:28,376 --> 00:16:29,543
Rough stuff?

453
00:16:29,544 --> 00:16:30,811
Did you forget that
you're talking

454
00:16:30,812 --> 00:16:32,713
to a girl in
a wheelchair?

455
00:16:32,714 --> 00:16:34,494
(sighs)

456
00:16:34,549 --> 00:16:36,851
Yeah, looks good.

457
00:16:36,852 --> 00:16:38,102
We've come
full circle.

458
00:16:38,103 --> 00:16:39,820
Yeah, just like old times.

459
00:16:39,821 --> 00:16:41,856
Though, to be clear,
there will be no

460
00:16:41,907 --> 00:16:43,407
extracurricular
activity this time.

461
00:16:43,491 --> 00:16:45,776
I'm going to Yale, and there
are no tire store majors there.

462
00:16:45,861 --> 00:16:48,195
Well, neither are there
at the Actors Studio,

463
00:16:48,196 --> 00:16:49,563
where I'm applying.

464
00:16:49,614 --> 00:16:51,594
CARLA:
Oh, my God.

465
00:16:52,951 --> 00:16:54,568
Quinn Fabray...

466
00:16:54,569 --> 00:16:56,891
you're so brave
to be doing this.

467
00:16:56,922 --> 00:16:58,572
Thank you.

468
00:16:58,573 --> 00:17:01,074
The atrophy in my leg
is a constant reminder

469
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:04,128
of the slow, withering remnants
of my past life.

470
00:17:04,129 --> 00:17:06,130
The toll can, at
times, be physically

471
00:17:06,214 --> 00:17:07,464
and emotionally hard,

472
00:17:07,465 --> 00:17:08,933
knowing that I may
never walk again.

473
00:17:09,017 --> 00:17:11,936
People like you
inspire me.

474
00:17:11,937 --> 00:17:14,939
Your healthy, normal
legs are beautiful.

475
00:17:17,058 --> 00:17:19,059
You deserve this.

476
00:17:21,396 --> 00:17:23,280
You've got my vote.

477
00:17:26,952 --> 00:17:30,550
Wow, that was super creepy.

478
00:17:30,605 --> 00:17:32,406
It won't be when we're standing

479
00:17:32,407 --> 00:17:34,875
up on that stage
soaking up the applause.

480
00:17:34,876 --> 00:17:36,944
Don't you feel kind of weird
using your injury

481
00:17:36,945 --> 00:17:38,349
to get the sympathy vote
like that?

482
00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:41,081
Votes are votes, Finn.

483
00:17:41,082 --> 00:17:43,450
Do you want to win or not?

484
00:17:44,636 --> 00:17:45,920
(school bell ringing)

485
00:17:54,624 --> 00:17:57,176
This is awesome.

486
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:59,729
I actually really
love dinosaurs.

487
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,041
MIKE:
Whoa.

488
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,650

00:19:27,651 --> 00:19:29,885
take a deep, meaningful drink

527
00:19:29,937 --> 00:19:34,073
of Sue Sylvester's
Special Prombrosia.

528
00:19:34,157 --> 00:19:37,109
I don't know if it's the
sentimental fetus in me talking,

529
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,345
but I think it's
my best batch ever.

530
00:19:39,396 --> 00:19:40,729
Nothing but Fruit Juicy Red,

531
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:42,949
Manhattan Seltzer
and seven tablespoons

532
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:44,200
of Visine,

533
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:46,735
just so we get out
of here on time.

534
00:19:46,736 --> 00:19:47,954
Uh, have you seen Quinn?

535
00:19:47,955 --> 00:19:49,956
I-I want to make
sure that I can, uh,

536
00:19:49,957 --> 00:19:52,258
get her and her wheelchair
up on stage when she wins.

537
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:54,627
Well, she had a couple
of cups of punch earlier,

538
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:56,712
so I'd probably start
with the little girls' room.

(cheering and applause)

544
00:20:15,232 --> 00:20:16,949
FINN:
Hello.

545
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,268
Hey, Quinn, Quinn, you in here?

546
00:20:21,938 --> 00:20:23,739
You... you can walk?

547
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,408
Yeah.

548
00:20:25,409 --> 00:20:26,876
Isn't it amazing?

549
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,448
You're seeing me
take my first steps.

550
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:34,083
So you-you... you lied to us.

551
00:20:34,084 --> 00:20:35,418
To everybody.

552
00:20:35,419 --> 00:20:37,753
No, I mean, my legs
are getting better,

553
00:20:37,754 --> 00:20:40,089
but I wanted it
to be a surprise.

554
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,458
You know, for when
I walk up there

555
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:45,144
and... and get my crown.

556
00:20:45,145 --> 00:20:47,629
The crowd will go wild.

557
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,966
I really want this.
Yeah.

558
00:20:51,018 --> 00:20:52,818
You may want this,

559
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:54,854
but Rachel needs me,
and... and I picked

560
00:20:54,938 --> 00:20:56,155
you over her.

561
00:20:56,156 --> 00:20:58,074
Do you know how stupid
that makes me feel?

562
00:20:58,075 --> 00:20:59,358
You have everything.

563
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,809
You're going to have your crown.

564
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,078
You're going
to go to Yale.

565
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,079
Rachel has
none of that.

566
00:21:03,146 --> 00:21:04,747
And tonight, thanks to you,

567
00:21:04,748 --> 00:21:06,615
she doesn't even have me.
We're a shoo-in.

568
00:21:06,616 --> 00:21:08,367
I need you.

569
00:21:08,452 --> 00:21:09,869
No, you don't need me, okay?

570
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,203
I-I-I thought

571
00:21:11,288 --> 00:21:12,872
going through all
that terrible stuff

572
00:21:12,956 --> 00:21:14,256
this year made you cooler,

573
00:21:14,257 --> 00:21:15,991
but no, you're still
the same old Quinn.

574
00:21:15,992 --> 00:21:17,826
All that matters is you.
Come on, stop!

575
00:21:17,827 --> 00:21:19,161
Please.

576
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,766
Look, it's mandatory
for the nominees

577
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:25,634
to have at least one
dance together.

578
00:21:28,138 --> 00:21:30,139
I know you don't understand

579
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,941
how much this means
to me, but...

580
00:21:34,978 --> 00:21:37,846
... will you please
just stay here for me?

581
00:21:37,847 --> 00:21:39,515
Please.

582
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,654
Oh, my God.
All right.

583
00:21:45,655 --> 00:21:48,624
Let the very first annual
McKinley High Anti-Prom begin.

584
00:21:51,694 --> 00:21:53,662
Oh, look, there's
chocolates on the pillows.

585
00:21:53,663 --> 00:21:55,164
We got room service.

586
00:21:55,165 --> 00:21:56,607
Minibar! Whoo!

587
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,217
Nice!

588
00:21:58,218 --> 00:22:00,419
So, uh, what
should we do now?

589
00:22:00,504 --> 00:22:02,871
Duh... play strip poker.

590
00:22:02,872 --> 00:22:04,306
(sing-songy):
I brought condoms.

591
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:09,111
Becky, Blaine and I
are gay, remember?

592
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:10,563
Never stopped me before.

593
00:22:10,564 --> 00:22:12,181
(clicking tongue)

594
00:22:12,182 --> 00:22:15,484
Well, I mean, no matter what,
it'll be better than prom.

595
00:22:15,485 --> 00:22:19,155
Yeah! Who wants to be in
that smelly old gym, anyway?

596
00:22:19,156 --> 00:22:20,439
Prom's a sucker's
paradise.

597
00:22:20,524 --> 00:22:24,110
Prom sucks!
Let's get wasted! Whoo!

598
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:26,695
Becky, Becky, we appreciate
your enthusiasm,

599
00:22:26,696 --> 00:22:29,448
but will you just keep it down
with the shouting?

600
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:32,734
Keep your big honking nose out
of it, Berry!

601
00:22:32,735 --> 00:22:33,811
Oh, snap! Oh snap!

602
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,538
So, I wouldn't mind

603
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:36,731
watching a little TV.

604
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:38,257
Um, maybe some Bravo?

605
00:22:38,258 --> 00:22:39,776
Dude, it's a hotel.
It's gotta be Skinemax.

606
00:22:39,843 --> 00:22:42,678
We could put on a fashion show!

607
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:44,713
Yeah! Let's go all
<i>Sound of Music</i>

608
00:22:44,714 --> 00:22:46,215
and make some old-timey couture

609
00:22:46,216 --> 00:22:47,850
out of the drapes and bedsheets, huh?
Too gay!

610
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:48,868
I second that.

611
00:22:48,918 --> 00:22:50,119
Well, I'd love

612
00:22:50,187 --> 00:22:52,138
to show you guys my prom dress.

613
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:54,140
I wouldn't want it
to go completely to waste.

614
00:22:54,141 --> 00:22:55,975
It's in my car.
I can go get it.

615
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:57,193
(blows raspberry)

616
00:22:57,194 --> 00:22:59,145
Worst anti-prom ever!

Come and finish it with me?

653
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:51,724
Yeah, I will...
as soon as you stand up

654
00:24:51,725 --> 00:24:53,475
and show everybody how much
you deserve this,

655
00:24:53,476 --> 00:24:56,011
how much you deserve
to be Prom Queen

656
00:24:56,062 --> 00:24:57,229
Are you really doing
this right now?

657
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,647
What, making you walk?

658
00:24:58,648 --> 00:25:00,875
Make you stand up and show
everybody how much of

659
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,184
a crazy liar you are? Yeah.

660
00:25:02,185 --> 00:25:04,103
Come on. Stand up!
What's going on, dude?

661
00:25:04,104 --> 00:25:06,272
Did you know that she could walk, too?
You must have

662
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:07,723
with all that physical therapy
you've been giving.

663
00:25:07,724 --> 00:25:09,108
Hey, just finish the dance
with me!

664
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:10,075
Stand the hell up!
Come on!

665
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:11,393
What is wrong
with you?!

666
00:25:11,394 --> 00:25:13,529
Hey, hey, hey!
You forcing me

667
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,532
to eject you from
yet another prom, Hudson?

668
00:25:17,751 --> 00:25:19,785
Not this time, Coach.

669
00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:21,870
Good idea, Frumps.

670
00:25:21,871 --> 00:25:24,573
What are you looking at,
Jar-Jar Binks?

671
00:25:29,956 --> 00:25:33,959
Touch those peanut M&M's,
and I will end you.

672
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,927
This is a repeat.
It's the one with

673
00:25:35,928 --> 00:25:39,498
the passive-aggressive lesbian
and the doggy care.

674
00:25:39,499 --> 00:25:42,250
I wish Tabatha would
take over this anti-prom.

675
00:25:42,251 --> 00:25:44,169
Gosh, this sucks.

676
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,754
Yeah, well...

677
00:25:45,755 --> 00:25:47,722
If you wanted to go
to the prom,

678
00:25:47,723 --> 00:25:49,091
I would have gone
with you.

679
00:25:49,092 --> 00:25:50,792
I am not going

680
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:53,979
to give into Brittany's
insane ban on hair gel.

681
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,397
Freedom to use hair care
products?

682
00:25:55,464 --> 00:25:57,099
It's in the Bill of Rights.

683
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,017
Didn't the founding
fathers all wear wigs?

684
00:25:59,102 --> 00:26:00,569
You haven't seen me

685
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,671
without an enormous amount
of gel in my hair.

686
00:26:02,672 --> 00:26:04,940
It's, it's really bad.

687
00:26:04,991 --> 00:26:05,774
(knocking)

688
00:26:05,775 --> 00:26:07,242
Finally,

689
00:26:07,243 --> 00:26:10,662
the room service is here.
I want my shrimp cocktail!

690
00:26:12,832 --> 00:26:15,324
Hey, Becky.

691
00:26:15,368 --> 00:26:16,985
Where's Rachel?

692
00:26:16,986 --> 00:26:19,788
She's been in the bathroom
for 45 minutes.

693
00:26:19,789 --> 00:26:21,840
I'm guessing the runs.

694
00:26:21,908 --> 00:26:23,291
All right, let's let

695
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:26,128
the anti-prom fashion
extravaganza begin.

696
00:26:26,179 --> 00:26:27,253
Hi.

697
00:26:28,998 --> 00:26:30,599
What are you doing here?

698
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:32,884
Well, I'll keep it simple.

699
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:35,437
I love you. You're beautiful.

700
00:26:35,438 --> 00:26:36,721
Prom sucks without you.

701
00:26:48,151 --> 00:26:50,651
Prom sucks without
all of you, guys.

702
00:26:50,703 --> 00:26:52,020
This is the last t time

703
00:26:52,021 --> 00:26:54,239
we're gonna get to be together
like this.

704
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,358
I want to dance with my
fiancé, dance with my friends.

705
00:26:59,562 --> 00:27:01,830
Well, I'll just pretend
to be an iceculpture

706
00:27:01,831 --> 00:27:04,365
if Brittany sees me,
and then she'll just pass me by.

707
00:27:05,201 --> 00:27:06,885
So, you guys gonna come?

708
00:27:06,969 --> 00:27:08,720
Not until I get
my shrimp cocktail.

709
00:27:08,721 --> 00:27:10,755
I'm good.
And you guys go ahead.

710
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,506
Come on, dude.
You're my wingman.

711
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:14,976
I'll go next year.

712
00:27:15,044 --> 00:27:16,928
Come.

713
00:27:25,154 --> 00:27:27,656
Are you ready for strip poker,
Puckerman?

714
00:27:28,691 --> 00:27:31,610
Socks count as one item.

715
00:27:42,905 --> 00:27:45,164
I'm so glad you guys came.

716
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:46,424
Better late than never, right?

717
00:27:46,425 --> 00:27:47,759
Come on.
Let's dance.

In the joint.

764
00:30:17,176 --> 00:30:20,095
Well, I'm one losing
hand away

765
00:30:20,096 --> 00:30:21,713
from an extremely
awkward situation,

766
00:30:21,714 --> 00:30:23,882
so would you mind laying
off a little bit?

767
00:30:23,883 --> 00:30:27,668
I can't. I'm too pissed off.
Why?

768
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:30,855
'Cause I didn't get nominated
for prom queen

769
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,174
like that girl in
the commercial.

770
00:30:33,175 --> 00:30:36,061
Coach Sue said
I couldn't get the votes.

771
00:30:36,062 --> 00:30:37,295
You really wanted that crown,
huh?

772
00:30:37,363 --> 00:30:40,115
More than anything.

773
00:30:40,116 --> 00:30:42,083
It hurts, Puck.

774
00:30:42,151 --> 00:30:44,702
Becky Jackson...

775
00:30:44,703 --> 00:30:46,955
I'm putting some clothes on
'cause I have an idea.

776
00:30:47,022 --> 00:30:48,356
Really?

777
00:30:48,407 --> 00:30:50,691
Yeah, check it out.

778
00:30:50,743 --> 00:30:52,293
We still haven't crowned a king

779
00:30:52,294 --> 00:30:54,129
and queen for
the anti-prom, have we?

780
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,330
No, we haven't.

781
00:30:55,381 --> 00:30:57,215
I'm gonna bust out my knife.

782
00:30:57,299 --> 00:30:58,500
(giggles)

783
00:30:58,501 --> 00:31:00,051
If you ask me, I think

784
00:31:00,136 --> 00:31:03,153
the anti-prom's
the most important prom of all.

785
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:10,378
First, we need a king.

786
00:31:10,429 --> 00:31:11,729
Nice.

787
00:31:11,814 --> 00:31:15,433
And then now,
we need a queen. Hmm...

788
00:31:15,518 --> 00:31:17,936
I hope I get it.

789
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,105
Becky Jackson...

790
00:31:20,106 --> 00:31:24,075
I crown you the Queen
of the anti-prom.

791
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,361
Take a look.

792
00:31:28,781 --> 00:31:30,999
Oh, my gosh!

793
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,619
I did it.
(chuckles)

794
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,588
I'm so happy.

795
00:31:36,589 --> 00:31:39,207
Your Highness,
what do you say we get out of here?

796
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:40,607
Sure.

797
00:31:41,851 --> 00:31:43,294
My prince.

798
00:31:47,622 --> 00:31:48,989
QUINN:
Hey, I got your text.

799
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,124
You have three
minutes.

800
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:51,942
The voting has started,
and I need

801
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,829
to get out there
and press the flesh.

802
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:55,329
Look, I owe you
an apology.

803
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,331
I-I found out
that you and Finn

804
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,465
were campaigning
together,

805
00:31:58,466 --> 00:31:59,967
and I kind of
freaked out.

806
00:31:59,968 --> 00:32:02,086
I got really jealous
and irrational,

807
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:03,787
I just, I should have
been supportive.

808
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,923
Well, since I had no idea
that was going on,

809
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,591
it's pretty easy
to forgive you.

810
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,309
So I'm glad we cleared
this up.

811
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,796
Wait.
Do you not understand

812
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:14,181
what you mean to me?

813
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,809
When we first met,

814
00:32:15,817 --> 00:32:17,985
you were everything
I wanted to be:

815
00:32:17,986 --> 00:32:19,970
You were beautiful
and popular,

816
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:20,970
and you had Finn.

817
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:23,607
How the mighty have fallen.

818
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,742
No, you don't understand.

819
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:26,276
I still see you
the same way, okay?

820
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:29,847
That's why I got so crazy.

821
00:32:29,848 --> 00:32:32,149
Because I wasn't seeing
the new Quinn.

822
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,784
The still-beautiful,

823
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,372
but humbled
and inspiring Quinn.

824
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:40,793
I, I've lost so much
over these past few weeks.

825
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:42,126
And I honestly
don't know

826
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,461
what the hell I'm gonna do
to do with my life.

827
00:32:44,512 --> 00:32:46,597
But when I look back
on my high school career

828
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:48,682
the one thing, the one
accomplishment that I'm gonna be

829
00:32:48,683 --> 00:32:51,018
so proud of is that I found
a way to be your friend.

830
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,222
So I'm apologizing
to my friend.

831
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,174
And I also want you
to know that

832
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:58,776
I voted for you
for Prom Queen.

833
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:00,811
And I really think you
deserve it.

834
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:02,780
Stop making out
with Berry and

835
00:33:02,781 --> 00:33:04,148
get to the
Spanish room, Quinn.

836
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:06,316
It's time to count the votes
and declare me the winner.

837
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,651
Right.

838
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,519
Bye. Good luck.

839
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,162
Drop that ladle,
Cohen-Chang!

840
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,529
Ooh, I'm onto you, lady.

841
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,865
You're trying to
spike my punch!

842
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:23,333
No, I'm not.
I'm just thirsty.

843
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,585
I'm dehydrated from
all the crying.

844
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,170
Yeah, right.

845
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,338
That dress is hideous.

846
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,811

847
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:39,399
BECKY: <i>Becky Faye Jackson,
you've done it!</i>

848
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,654
<i>You're at senior prom with
a crown on your head,</i>

849
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:46,857
<i>and a hot piece of booty
on your arm.</i>

850
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,575
<i>And for once in my life,</i>

851
00:33:48,576 --> 00:33:52,079
<i>I don't mind everybody
staring at me.</i>

852
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,367
Game on, beautiful.

853
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,702
Born for this, Puckerman.

854
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:03,740
Becky, I don't care which dope
we crown here tonight,

855
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:06,260
you are truly the queen
of this joint.

856
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:08,245
Thanks, Coach!

857
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:09,631
Oh, my God!

858
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:11,181
Is that a sniper
in the rafters?

859
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:13,510
Oh, I knew I should've
done another security sweep.

860
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:14,852
I don't see anything.

861
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:17,221
Use your infrared
glasses, Coach.

862
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,522
Good idea, Becky.

863
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:22,976
I don't see anything.

864
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,766
Dance with me, Puckerman?

865
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:32,703
Thank you for making my dream
come true, my queen.

866
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:38,425
(sniffing)

867
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,661
SANTANA: My count for king
is the same as yours.

868
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:42,296
I don't get it.

869
00:34:42,297 --> 00:34:44,214
How could Brittany have only
gotten four votes?

870
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,883
This Dino Prom theme
was a smash.

871
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:48,285
Well, maybe it has something
to do with the fact

872
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:49,636
that she's a girl.

873
00:34:49,637 --> 00:34:51,305
Well, screw this.

874
00:34:51,306 --> 00:34:54,591
I don't want to be queen
if Britt isn't king.

875
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:59,629
Well, good, because my count for
queen was the same as yours.

876
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,098
I won by one vote.

877
00:35:06,621 --> 00:35:09,239
I won.

878
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,858
It's everything I've ever wanted

879
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:15,629
and I don't feel any different.

880
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,848
Cool.

881
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:20,100
I mean, I guess
you deserve to win, right?

882
00:35:20,101 --> 00:35:23,637
What with being a crip and all.

883
00:35:23,638 --> 00:35:26,807
You know, we really have had
the dream high school careers.

884
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:31,695
Mega-popular,
doing whatever we wanted.

885
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:33,530
Whoever we wanted.

886
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:35,098
You know, I'm really
not surprised

887
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,427
that you and I were
the top two candidates.

888
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:39,119
Yeah.

889
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,848
Well, you know, it would be
boring if we weren't so awesome.

890
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,608
Don't you want to leave this
place having made a difference?

891
00:36:01,295 --> 00:36:02,763
Oh, my dear God.

892
00:36:02,814 --> 00:36:04,731
Don't make fun of
the new kid

893
00:36:04,799 --> 00:36:06,817
with the bad 'fro.
It's hair-bullying.

894
00:36:06,818 --> 00:36:09,126
That's not a new kid.
That's Blaine without hair gel.

895
00:36:09,154 --> 00:36:11,137
Is it really
that bad?

896
00:36:11,138 --> 00:36:13,106
Yeah, you're Mr. Broccoli Head.
It's not that bad.

897
00:36:13,107 --> 00:36:14,274
Yeah, it is.
It's really bad.

898
00:36:14,275 --> 00:36:16,216
And you made your point.

899
00:36:16,244 --> 00:36:18,195
I abuse my power as president...
but to help save the prom,

900
00:36:18,196 --> 00:36:20,596
and to keep people from turning
to stone when they look at you,

901
00:36:20,615 --> 00:36:23,450
I'll give you special permission
to wear hair gel, immediately.

902
00:36:23,451 --> 00:36:24,558
(microphone feedback squeals)

903
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:25,953
FIGGINS:
Quiet, please, children.

904
00:36:25,954 --> 00:36:28,655
I'll be right back.

905
00:36:28,706 --> 00:36:29,623
FIGGINS:
Thank you, thank you.

906
00:36:29,624 --> 00:36:31,291
Don't you dare.

907
00:36:31,292 --> 00:36:33,126
I love finally getting
to see the real you.

908
00:36:33,127 --> 00:36:34,511
The man without
the product.

909
00:36:34,512 --> 00:36:37,347
And I want everyone here to
know just how proud I am

910
00:36:37,348 --> 00:36:40,350
of my brave, handsome,
bushy-haired boyfriend.

911
00:36:40,351 --> 00:36:42,019
Come on, Barrette.

912
00:36:43,304 --> 00:36:45,522
First I have
an announcement to make:

913
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:48,392
There are reptiles living in
McKinley toilets no more.

914
00:36:48,476 --> 00:36:52,479
The family of snakes has been
safely removed to the zoo,

915
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,032
and they can life out their
lives in the toilets there.

916
00:36:55,033 --> 00:36:57,484
(cheering)

917
00:36:57,485 --> 00:37:00,237
And now, this year's Prom Court:

918
00:37:00,238 --> 00:37:04,157
(drumroll)

919
00:37:04,158 --> 00:37:05,676
(cymbal crash)

920
00:37:05,743 --> 00:37:09,195

the Prom King are:

921
00:37:09,196 --> 00:37:11,146

922
00:37:11,165 --> 00:37:13,550

926
00:37:23,428 --> 00:37:26,328
And President
Brittany S. Pierce.

927
00:37:26,347 --> 00:37:27,981

928
00:37:31,269 --> 00:37:33,904

... and Miss Quinn Fabray.

00:37:49,787 --> 00:37:53,173
(applause)

935
00:37:53,174 --> 00:37:54,708
I would like to invite
last year's queen,

936
00:37:54,709 --> 00:37:57,294
sassy male student Kurt Hummel,

937
00:37:57,295 --> 00:37:59,596
to crown this year's winners.

938
00:37:59,597 --> 00:38:01,431
(drummer playing sultry beat)

939
00:38:04,636 --> 00:38:06,436
(applause, whooping)

940
00:38:09,557 --> 00:38:11,775
And...

941
00:38:11,776 --> 00:38:15,612
this year's Prom King is...

942
00:38:15,613 --> 00:38:20,100

943
00:38:20,101 --> 00:38:21,952
Hmm...

944
00:38:24,572 --> 00:38:25,822
Mr. Finn Hudson.

945
00:38:25,823 --> 00:38:28,041
(applause, cheering)

946
00:38:30,578 --> 00:38:31,628
Go, Finn!

947
00:38:44,392 --> 00:38:48,478
And the winner
for Prom Queen is...

948
00:38:48,479 --> 00:38:51,648
(drumroll)

949
00:38:51,649 --> 00:38:52,816

951
00:38:54,402 --> 00:38:58,639
Students, for the second year
in a row, we have prom anarchy.

952
00:38:58,706 --> 00:39:02,257
Receiving the majority of
write-in votes,

953
00:39:02,309 --> 00:39:04,978
I would like to welcome
on the stage...

954
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,251

958
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,520
Smile and breathe.

959
00:39:50,992 --> 00:39:54,711
McKinley Titans,
bow down to your new leaders!
