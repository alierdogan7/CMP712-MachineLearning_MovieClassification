To marry Kuruvila, and

''At a distance..''

105
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:37,244
So, this is the place it's a heritage

106
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:38,753
To climb the step, turn left

107
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,490
Again to climb step, turn right

108
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,456
By then the step will be finished

109
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,186
So, there is no need of
help from me, no?

111
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,762
Okay see you then

112

lt is me..Ammini!
Ammini!

114
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,613
Are you standing here?

115
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:51,223
The person out here
had purchased Ammini

116
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,221
For my daughterto play

117
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,256
On that day he left, l

118
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,586
l was hospitalised,
reached today only

119
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,928
There is a person waiting for
you at the hut, Ummukolusu!

120
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,586
Usman Ekka, l don't want your room

121
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,685
Sister tell what has happened?
Tell the matter

122
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,589
When l came here one person
had come and taken his goat

123
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,557
Only that much,
that's our Ammini isn't it?

124
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,198
She was taken
by our goat Abutikka

125
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,335
His heart is so tender
like goat's milk

126
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,299
There is no relation between the
photo you send and with this room

127
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,233
There is no lockable door,
the room isn't properly cleaned

128
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:48,742
l had told you to come after a
week when the room gets ready

129
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,439
You came in a haste and telling
like this, that itself is wrong

130
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:54,610
Everything will be ready

131
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,344
Will anyone turn up
asking for goat and cow?

132
00:15:56,922 --> 00:16:00,653
Now who is there to come?
Now only he has to come!

133
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:05,657
He has left, no? Only
god knows when he will come

134
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,105
How is it going over there?

135
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,978
lt was bit of a problem,
the house wasn't cleaned

136
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,710
Girl, your mother had called me,
l didn't pick up the phone

137
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:37,611
You can just do some tricks and
escape, l'm the one to answer

138
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,120
l'll call you back okay

139
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:45,493
Banana, jaggery without
salt, to brew paddy is good

140
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,460
lt is simply the best
to pour and drink!

141
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,462
lt will run through the throat

142
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:51,329
Hello, who are you?

143
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,334

00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:58,136
My Christ when did he do this?

145
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:02,411
From a long time l have
been saying don't be a bachelor

146
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:05,082
At that time will tell big
dialogue, l don't need a girl

147
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,448

Now when it whistles

154
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,104
lsn't it a spiritual whistling?

155
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:33,911
What is this? Hello, tell your
kids will break like crackers

156
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,744
They will whack you to pulp!

157

Me? Right now l'm in a forest
What, in a forest?

168
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,913
Like in stories which Rachel used to
say, a magician's den is there, no?

169
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,182
Like that in a den

170
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:20,975

No sir, l won't go
You don't marry

00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:20,587
You don't need this 'thing'
Honestly, l won't go

00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:28,765
You go to kitchen and
take that beef Vindaloo

Come on sit man

233
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:03,505
Mr. Dezuza!
Sir, l'm Sunni, thief Sunni!

234
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:05,074
Fellow what a crapy name is this?

235
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:07,767
Fellow even Kerala Congress
people have better name, than this

236
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:09,773
The name should have a power!

237
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,340
Karl Max, Rosa Luxemburg!

238
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:15,247
V.S Achuthanandhan, VSOP!

239
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:20,613
This is simply Suni Kuttan! From
today onwards you are Dezuza

240
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:24,326
Dezuza, were you
caught by police, any time?

241
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:25,823
For the first time?
Yeah

242
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:31,294
Forthe first time, when l was 18
years of age, l went to steal

243
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:35,303
When l went there at night that sir
was lying on the bed without cloths

244
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,102
Very near to him,
sir's wife was sleeping

245
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,510
lf that sister wakes
up, thinking that -

246
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:42,111
- she shouldn't get
scared on seeing sir's 'thing'

247
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:44,508
l stripped off my
cloth and clothed him

248
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:47,344
Suddenly that sister woke up
and on seeing me she got scared

249
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:50,310
What? Got scared on seeing you?

250
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:53,650
She didn't get scared but laughed!

251
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,523
Just like this that sister also laughed!

252
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:58,490
On hearing that,
that brother woke up

253
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:00,630
When brother woke
up, saw me and sister standing

254
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:03,460
Without saying anything to anyone,
that sirjailed me on a false charge

255
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:06,068
Honestly l went to steal, there
wasn't any kind of illicit relationship

256
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:11,300
And how long were you jailed?
For 8 to 9 months l was inside

257
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,740
ln nut shell it is a
pregnancy period, isn't it?

258
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:16,806
Mr. Dezuza, what do you
want from here?

259
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:18,706
Sir, aren't you killing me?

260
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:21,750
To kill another person,
Mr.Dezuza who has got the rights?

261
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:27,682
That's great, same catchy dialogue
which is said in 'Quran and Seeta'

262
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:30,394
Seeta?
Geeta!

263
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:32,629

264
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,695
My goodness it is 2 O'clock sir, l

265
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:38,901

268
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:48,811
Sir, you try to go and sleep,
then what? - Hold on fellow!

269
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:51,715
To come here you don't

270
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:56,776
But to return, my son!

On changing the dress, where

274
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:09,827
Not for a movie but to see
a 'bride to be', for you

275
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:11,700
Then put some spray

276

Then can't you clean that
house when you are free?

285
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,598
Even the scrap pickers will
get frightened on seeing it

286
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:49,397
Even l got scared

287
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:53,340

00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:12,191
Don't clean that - Then what
can it remain like this?

344
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,595
l'll clean it myself
lt's totally messy!

345
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,701
A sort of mood out
Was he staying here?

346
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,062
ls it?

347
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:26,708
What is it?
Balance of a story from here

348
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,310
Girl, what is this?

349
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,909
Have you come here to
learn music or to read a book?

350
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:33,241
That Kuruvila had called me

351
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:35,677
Where did he get the number?
From your mother

352
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:38,650
You leave that story
and Kuruvila and be happy

353
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:41,188
Shall leave the Kuruvila,
but the story is good

354
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:44,287
Look this story and life they are
two different extremes, okay

355
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:47,129
Look the boat is leaving
Hey fellow, stop there

356
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:50,701
Don't throw
Stop there l say

357
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:53,803
Telling you to stop there
Don't make me run like this

358
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:55,131
Sister save, don't move
Just move back, let me catch him

359
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,638
Sister which is the perfume?

360
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:59,275
Let me catch him

361
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:01,277
There, he escaped again

362
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:05,782
Come, come hold my hand

363
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,608
Come

364
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:12,319
PC catch him

365
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:17,025
Hey stop there
Don't jump

366
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:51,060
He is a cool guy he
had a deadly scooter with him

367
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,321
For a foreignerfrom Spain
l had told a price for the scooter

368
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:57,962
My god, only that mad
man knows how we escaped?

369
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,729
Can you find him?
What to find?

370
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:04,907
Can you look out for him?
He is beyond my reach

371
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:07,036
Did you recognise
anyone among this?

372
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:11,744
What is this goat figure?
This is like our goat Abutikka

373
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:17,083
Then this one, it is very familiar
but can't get the focus

374
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,289
Will get it where else
to go otherthan to get?

375
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,628
Yeah, this is the house

376
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:40,133
Okay then l'm not staying, from
Germany one client is waiting

377
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,868
Okay then see you
Okay

378
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,707
l was not in station had to undergo
certain difficulties of that, isn't it?

379
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:50,419
Rahiya, water
Father coming

380
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:52,221
By the way why did you
say, you wanted to meet me?

381
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:55,859
Well, Usman Ekka, who was
staying in that room earlier

382
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:57,755
Sister that is a 'Genie'

383
00:39:57,995 --> 00:40:01,294
That is why l told l'll clean
the room and then you occupy

384
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:06,360
Spirit got into you, isn't it?
That is, thanks

385
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:09,272
From there l got
a comic, l got a story

386
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:12,271
To know what is the
remaining part of it one curiosity

387
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:14,068
lf l could just meet that person

388
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,941
Sister are you mad to
find the rest of story?

389
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:20,140
Look, when that person
came here he had drawn this

390
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,945
l haven't asked what is the
remaining part of this, he hasn't told

391
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:30,755
This is Pathumma's home
Where is Ummukolusu's home?

392
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:35,322
Ummukolusu's home, no?
Yeah!

393
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,262
Shall do it now

394
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:46,034
Team DrC

395
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:57,847
Do you know where this person is
at present? - Don't ask that, only

396
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:00,717
He will give an unexpected visit
That is his way of doing

397
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:02,825
Can't say when he will come

398
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,419
To contact is there any way?

399
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:09,061
No phone to call no address
to write letter, nothing is there

400
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:11,891
lf he comes here,
he will visit David's home

401
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,331
Only after touching there
he will go to any other place

402
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:18,000
Saying there are angels
on the attic of the church

403
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:20,177
During childhood
you had gone in search of it

404
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:21,470
My Rachael, it's not like that

405
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,206
These are some of the
astonishing sketches

406
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:27,181
Then the room l stay, that thief and
that person, are the characters in tale

407
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:30,115
Don't keep searching and
go to a far off place, okay

408
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:31,379
Your brother is calling
me and asking the number

409
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:33,022
My goodness, don't give that okay

410
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:36,125
l'll tell, l'm going to meet
a person, don't disturb

411
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,454
Okay then

412
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:56,373
Mr. David?

413
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:35,577
'Demise'

414
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:40,949
'Demise'

415
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:46,229
'Demise - Charlie (1981 - 2014)

416
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,393
'Demise - Charlie (1981 - 2014)

417
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:17,357
Compatriots say that he is mad

418
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:21,460
Sometimes l also feel that
he is really lunatic!

419
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:24,099
Otherwise will anyone in
the world do such a thing?

420
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,862
What is this?

421
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:31,273
What fellow? Are you
making people a fool?

422
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,036
Doctor, you don't get perplexed
Look, you don't talk, more

423
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:37,614
Hey Panikkar doctor he celebrated
his birthday in his own way!

424
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:39,348
You don't talk!
You can't be corrected!

425
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:42,041
Now, what is your problem?
Hasn't he died?

426
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:43,585
Or gave an ad that he
is dead, which is the issue?

427
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,478
Yes man, is my
wish to see him dead?

428
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:47,588
Don't make a scene

429
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:51,985
Sir, what is this? lf the elder
people start doing like this?

430
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:53,894
Come on sit
Leave me

431
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:59,194
Won't allow to booze
and eat peacefully!

432
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:01,065
Simply creating issues

433
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:11,045
Pal!
Pal, have a drink

434
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:12,647
Yeah!

435
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:17,479
Pal, people coming to
know the death of mine -

436
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:20,350
- to feel and see that
curiosity l have put that ad

437
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:25,084
'A game with death'
its a real feeling!

438
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:30,594
l got so much thrilled, it was a
feeling as if l'm on a 'giant wheel'

439
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:36,698
lf we become a 'dead body' on
taking a census, will know who will come

440
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:40,202
But there some 'exclusive people'
which we may not know

441
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:43,178
'Certain unexpected people'

442
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:47,039
Kathrenamma, had
come from 'Venni Mala'

443
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:52,578
She was really sick
but she is a beautiful child

444
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:56,024
A small child, she is aged 83

445
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,556
She had come along
with younger son

446
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:03,358
Then there was 'Das' he is blind

447
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:07,964
The vision is inside, he
is a singer in the train

448
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:10,504
'The train Das'

449
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:13,633
Then came Chandran

450
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:16,039
All whacked me nicely

451
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:20,175
Look there is no place left on
this body without a whack!

452
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:25,281
lt is out of love, pal like
you all loves me a lot

453
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:30,087
Now you tell, upon dying can
we experience any of these?

454
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:36,589
For making you upset, what
should l give? Come on tell

455
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,097
Do you want to beat me again?
Go on beat

00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:56,408
''My wife's home
is on a hill of moon''

''On visiting there, will serve
with coffee, black coffee''

458
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:02,584
Lot of people had come

459
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:05,695
All the people who came were
served with liquor and food -

460
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:07,792
- which he made, till morning it
was full of singing and enjoyment

461
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:18,507
Why, did you get scared?

462
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,671
So, you are staying in the place
where he stayed, aren't you?

463
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:28,784
Can't say from where and all
people come searching for him

464
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:31,644
Some people from
Belgium, some from Bangalore

465
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:33,220
Some people from some orphanage

466
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:35,448
On the previous day
few people had come to beat him

467
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,620
But forthe first time, a
girl comes searching for him

468
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:43,325
Okay then

469
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:49,430
Look, does he know that such an
insane person is searching on him?

470
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:53,837
Don't know

471
00:46:57,614 --> 00:47:06,215

Sorry brother, please, please, no

We came searching for him
Sorry!

l have met him only once

485
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:17,217

'Ambu' festival at night

00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,573
Look, its the knife of father

513
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:26,575
Come on catch it fellow

514
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:28,984
Pathrose aren't you happy?

515
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:34,822
So, for the next 'Ambu' festival after
getting rid of daughter's sickness

516
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:37,892
We will together go to church

517
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:41,656
Pathrose come
Are you going?

518
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:44,024
We'll go and come fast,
daughter you may sleep

519
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:57,069
Sir, stop the vehicle

520
00:51:58,048 --> 00:51:58,878
Come on, stop

521
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:19,897
Sir, you take this

522
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:25,767
Thinking of daughter only came
to show the mermaid at night

523
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:28,172
And sir, don't show this kind of
filthy act to me, okay

524
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:30,809
Sir, if you want to do
that take a room in any lodge

525
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:33,880
Pathrose what's your problem? ls
it that child, sitting inside the car?.

526
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:36,686
Pathrose, that is our own child

527
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,011
Pathrose, you may also see
her as your own child

528
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:42,114
Sir, that is not possible,
sir you take this

529
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:45,824
Pathrose your daughter who is sick,
when she says she wants to see stars

530
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:47,087
What will Pathrose, do?

531
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:50,456
Won't you show the entire
stars spread on the sky?

532
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,133
This is also just like that

533
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:54,994
When this child told, she wants to
go to mid sea and wants to see mermaid

534
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,764
We should fulfil that wish no?

535
00:52:56,973 --> 00:53:00,670
A small wish - My sir l have been
going to this sea for 16 years

536
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:03,004
So far l have not seen the mermaid

537
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:06,182
What if, if you see one today?
My sir, all this is just a feeling

538
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:08,848
Pathrose, everything is a feeling

539
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:11,782
What if, if you and me
are the feelings of someone?

540
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:21,756
Look here, a mermaid
who has come to the shore

541
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:24,057
What looks she has got
Come

542
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:29,732
This is Pathrose
This is Queen Mary

543
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:31,100
Stop kidding sir

544
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:32,900
My name is Mariyam

545
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,011
Only this sir calls me Queen Marry

546
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,911
My name is Mathai

547
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,887
Sir, check the salt

548
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:52,159
Why salt? My dear salt, when
we are in the middle of salt

549
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:57,088
By the way, why one wish that
you want to see the sea at night?

550
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,097
That is all simply created by this sir

551
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:03,295
One dialogue to me, if
someone had shown herthe sea

552
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,130
Can l stay still hearing that?

553
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:07,640
That is why took her at night

554
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:11,141
Pathrose, pour one
she is very shy person

555
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:28,363
Team DrC

556
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,326
My goodness, look sir!
Mermaid!

557
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:38,696
That is the shape of the deity
who come to watch the sea

558
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:41,170
Christ!
That will roam in the sea

559
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:45,075
Christ is telling to the sea, to protect
the people in the sea and in the shore

560
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:48,807
Then will also tell to
the fish, to enter inside the net

561
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:51,543
Only if the Christ says,
only then will the sea listen

562
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:04,725
Sir, who is this lady? - She
is 'Mariyam' of 'Madalena'

563
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,299
So, sir are you the Christ?

564
00:55:09,606 --> 00:55:11,267
Pathrose, what is the time?

565
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:16,676
As per the calculation it
must be 12 O'clock - Exactly

566
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:18,313
Exactly
Are you sure? - Sure

567
00:55:18,682 --> 00:55:20,843

00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:19,801
My beautiful child, this sea
doesn't want the salt of your tears

576
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:25,010

Have you seen the heroine of 'Titanic?'

595
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:05,211
An innocent lady, a filthy
jerk has married her

596
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:08,516
From the next day after
wedding, he started pimping

597
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:11,519
All these years, he made
money by selling Mary

598
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:17,424
Two weeks back Mary had
a fever, on testing the blood

599
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:19,858
Came to know that it is a
disease without cure

601
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:32,097

The sea will hook you
down to the sea bed

607
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:21,989
She jumped to die, how to get her?.

608
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:28,155
After a long time, he came swimming
and sat at the verge of the boat

609
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:30,060
Without saying anything
he cried for a long time

610
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:33,599
For the first time and for the last
time, l had seen him on that day

611
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:36,535
l don't know when he
drew all this pictures

Father, who is this?

616
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:51,611
Other day, one uncle has
shown you magic, isn't it?

617
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:53,285

lf there is a block in the
heart, can consult a doctor

627
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:44,666
There is no medicine for this
lf you are that much busy

01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:46,632
Go straight through this way

629

684
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:06,614
lt is as if trying to catch
the wind, that is how he is

685
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:10,148
Won't get him, will give a small
chill and he will escape!

686
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,951
Daughter, you are upset aren't you?

687
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:16,082
When he came here, l told him

688
01:08:16,559 --> 01:08:19,687
There is a beautiful girl,
searching for you

689
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:22,090
On hearing that..
That..Fellow just laughed

690
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,129
He is a boy who
grew up without mother

691
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:28,497
That is what all this
childishness is about

692
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:32,764
Then till 15 years he
traveled a lot along with me

693
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:36,736
For his meal he gets from that

694
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:39,173
Between us there is no
father, son relation okay

695
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,782
A space between two
friends, that is always there

696
01:08:43,018 --> 01:08:46,749
A father who is lunatic who grew him
up, doesn't he become a lunatic?

697
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,121
We just going to roam
around are you coming?

698
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:58,990
Will it be him?

699
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:03,762
Come!

700
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:12,169
Hello!
My son, father!

Look, have you stopped booze?
Why not? Since a week

703
01:09:18,521 --> 01:09:20,648
See the sea as a
lover and be happy

704
01:09:20,856 --> 01:09:23,984
Hey fellow, look that girl
has come here - Which girl?

705
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:26,423
Hey fellow, other day l have told
no? That girl has come here

706
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:29,597
My Pop, tell that girl not yet time for
the 'Genie' to appear before her

707
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:31,062
Tell herto wait

708
01:09:31,467 --> 01:09:32,957
Fellow that is not the thing
That is the only thing

709
01:09:33,135 --> 01:09:34,432
Okay, the vehicle will leave now

710
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:35,468
Look, its him, its him

711
01:09:40,709 --> 01:09:41,733
Shucks!

712
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,613
There is some plan inside him

713
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:57,451
Then will he have to play
a 'cat and mouse game?'

714
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:02,519
He will come

Do you know where this
sir is at present?

01:14:35,037 --> 01:14:38,768
Sister, true upon this noodles have
seen on that day, then l haven't seen

750
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:41,475
Sister have you drawn this?
You are really talented

751
01:14:43,078 --> 01:14:44,477
Did you see this?
Yeah, l saw that

752
01:14:44,847 --> 01:14:47,315

balance is not detailed in this

753
01:14:47,516 --> 01:14:50,212
No, is it? Where else it
will go? l'll find it now itself

754
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:51,852
lt'll be here only

755
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:54,384
Hey fellow, that is not here

756
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:58,482
No, is it?
What is the balance that happened?

757
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:03,228
l was the one who climbed first

758
01:15:07,102 --> 01:15:08,797
Sir, was just behind me

759
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:24,547
What is it?

760
01:15:25,153 --> 01:15:26,916
Sir, we'll leave

761
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:29,917
Wait, wait, don't close it

01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:31,785
No sir, we'll leave sir

763
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:34,551
This won't be good at all
Don't close it - Sir, we'll leave

764
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:36,023
This isn't good at all

765
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:45,833
Sir, sir! Sir, don't go
Sir, no need

766
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:01,550

Sister was it you, who
was planning to die?

771
01:17:02,684 --> 01:17:04,311
No is it?

772
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:07,945
Since it was night l
couldn't see the face properly

773
01:17:09,091 --> 01:17:11,423
This is nice okay
Where is that house?

774
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:14,926
Why don't we go to that place?
Today?

775
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:17,155
Tonight its not possible, tonight l
have to visit a Gulf person's home

776
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:18,493
We'll go tomorrow, l'll come and pick

777
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,167

the day time l'll confused with route

01:17:37,686 --> 01:17:39,517
Sister, this is the one, sure
This is the one

781
01:17:40,055 --> 01:17:41,386
Not that one, this is the one

782

Why did you go to Kani's house?

791
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:49,654
lts not a spy work, lot of media
people had visited that home

792

who is never met at all

794

l couldn't recognise you
l had gone home

814
01:20:56,751 --> 01:20:58,218
Are you from the media?

815
01:21:00,889 --> 01:21:03,289
An incident had happened without
the knowledge of media people, no?

816
01:21:03,425 --> 01:21:04,790
ln Kani's life?

817
01:21:11,233 --> 01:21:13,326
On the previous new year day

818
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:20,140
ln this story it is not mentioned
what happened next on that night

819
01:21:22,244 --> 01:21:25,873
Kani, that Zaban and 3
other people had scolded Usman

820
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:27,738
Regarding the Thanya's matter

821
01:21:27,983 --> 01:21:32,215
To call and say all this matter to
him, he is in search of some Ruby

822
01:21:32,454 --> 01:21:34,445
He comes and leaves as
he wishes, let him come here

823
01:21:34,623 --> 01:21:36,887
Anyway don't leave
Thanya to play outside

824
01:21:37,525 --> 01:21:40,153
Who is this one?
Okay yeah recognised

825
01:21:40,295 --> 01:21:42,263
Friend is it?
l knew it

826
01:21:42,464 --> 01:21:45,831
l'm Kunjappan, so for
two days won't you be here?

827
01:21:46,635 --> 01:21:48,694
Should be here, that is the rule here

828
01:21:49,471 --> 01:21:52,304
Playing and all is good, but
kids don't go outside, okay

829
01:21:52,941 --> 01:21:56,274
We won't go
Good, kids should be like that

830
01:21:57,545 --> 01:22:00,241
ln search of this balance of
this story, coming this far?

831
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:03,441
Not the story, l came in search
of the person who wrote this story

832
01:22:11,493 --> 01:22:13,723
What is this? Today also its
the same wheat gruel

833
01:22:13,995 --> 01:22:16,463
Today its the wheat gruel,
tomorrow its the milk gruel

834
01:22:16,665 --> 01:22:19,463
Today also same old wheat gruel
How is wheat gruel?

835
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:24,468
Since abandoned by children
that is why staying here, is it?

836
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:27,301
Then what is wrong if you
could prepare some tasty food?

837
01:22:27,475 --> 01:22:31,275
My Sudhakara, tomorrow you'll
be fed with beef, is that okay?

838
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:32,446
Then what?

839
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:34,605
On seeing one plate of beef,
his heart will stop working

840
01:22:37,519 --> 01:22:39,680
By the way, daughter do you cook?

841
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:42,882
Nope - What a pity? When
will you learn all this?

842
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:45,619
Should prepare some good
food and serve to groom -

843
01:22:45,827 --> 01:22:47,488
- only then the things
will become strong

844
01:22:47,729 --> 01:22:49,356
That is the psychology of that matter

845
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:51,863
l'm not married
Really?

846
01:22:52,067 --> 01:22:53,932
Same pitch, l'm also not married

847
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:58,430
While saying not married, you must
have selected the groom, is it?

848
01:22:58,673 --> 01:23:00,504
Where is he? ls he in army?
Kunjappo!

849
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:05,043
While serving us with wheat gruel,
you are having soup overthere, no?

850
01:23:05,413 --> 01:23:07,472
Go man, go!

851
01:23:07,682 --> 01:23:10,674
This is my own child - lf he
had married at the right time

852
01:23:10,885 --> 01:23:12,853
He could have got an own
child like this, haven't he?

853
01:23:13,054 --> 01:23:15,488
For that l was in army, wasn't l?
Didn't get the time to marry

854
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:17,784
Then what? Were you
'firing' daily over there?

855
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:19,927
Just don't con man
Go man

856
01:23:20,695 --> 01:23:24,688
Daughter, this Kunjappan chettan
(brother) was in love with a Mariamma

857
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:27,697
Stupid! lf you change the
name and say l'll shoot you

858
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:31,396
lts not Mariamma, it is Thresia
Chakupurakal Thresia

859
01:23:31,606 --> 01:23:32,868
Okay if it is Thresia, fine
with Thresia

860
01:23:35,744 --> 01:23:38,713
Look, my house was
near the river shore

861
01:23:39,414 --> 01:23:41,541
So, the Thresia's house
was on the other shore

862
01:23:42,617 --> 01:23:44,642
Okay carry on, come on tell

863
01:23:44,919 --> 01:23:49,015
On a rainy day Kunjappan
chettan was drenched in love!

864
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:52,750
Hey fellow Chakko, while telling to
say a thing, is it how you tell that?

865
01:23:54,629 --> 01:23:59,089
Child, the thing is
this rain is love, isn't it?

866
01:23:59,601 --> 01:24:01,000
And the rain is love isn't it?

867
01:24:01,503 --> 01:24:03,733
This rained in cats and dogs!

868
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,531
Now, someone may tell the rest

869
01:24:07,776 --> 01:24:13,442
Now, what is there to say? Afterthe
rain when he swimmed to other shore

870
01:24:13,681 --> 01:24:16,707
There is no trace of Thresia at all!

871
01:24:17,619 --> 01:24:19,450
lt was completely drenched in water

872
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:25,389
lt was a severe rain which was
not in accordance with the time

873
01:24:26,127 --> 01:24:28,721
Thinking that when it gets over
will go and reveal the love

874
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:31,764
On reaching the other shore,
Thresia's home was washed off by water

875
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,468
They left the native by picking
up the rags which was left behind

876
01:24:34,669 --> 01:24:36,967
No one knew to
where they had gone

877
01:24:37,372 --> 01:24:40,398
At that time, l was
only aged 16 or 1 7

878
01:24:40,775 --> 01:24:43,938
l searched a lot, then came
the commitments of life

879
01:24:44,145 --> 01:24:47,581
Had joined the army, it
went on and on like that!

880
01:24:47,782 --> 01:24:49,147
Reached so far

881
01:24:49,517 --> 01:24:54,454
To say 'l love you to Thresia'
still now remaining unmarried

882
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:56,681
Yeah, fellow l'll remain
unmarried, l'll remain!

883
01:24:56,858 --> 01:24:58,621
lf there is yet another birth, at
that time also l'll stand like that

884
01:24:58,793 --> 01:25:00,420
That is the kick of love!

885
01:25:01,496 --> 01:25:03,760
Haven't you seen so far? -While
coming for each and every leave

886
01:25:03,965 --> 01:25:05,796
Will search here and there
Where to get?

887
01:25:06,501 --> 01:25:07,798
Then l'll return

888
01:25:08,136 --> 01:25:11,537
Hey fellow, love is a opium
which entices humans

889
01:25:11,739 --> 01:25:13,673
That is what is told
by one and only Karl Marx

890
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:15,968
No one over here
will understand all that

891
01:25:16,211 --> 01:25:18,111
But you have understood it, isn't it?

892
01:25:19,614 --> 01:25:22,640
See, there is a pain in waiting

893
01:25:23,651 --> 01:25:26,484
That is a pleasure
lsn't it?

894
01:25:30,558 --> 01:25:32,822
My goodness!
Come have the gruel

895
01:25:33,027 --> 01:25:34,995
Hello
Hello

896
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:36,856
Yeah, l can hear
Come on tell

897
01:25:37,031 --> 01:25:38,623
Girl, l can't hear what you are saying

898
01:25:38,867 --> 01:25:39,834
Right from morning l was calling

899
01:25:40,034 --> 01:25:41,729
Your mother and Georji
had come to meet me

900
01:25:41,936 --> 01:25:43,164
And then?
Hello

901
01:25:43,538 --> 01:25:45,733
Hello, they had asked
me where you are

902
01:25:46,674 --> 01:25:48,141
Hello
Hello

903
01:25:50,712 --> 01:25:52,509
Over here the range
of the phone is less

904
01:25:52,714 --> 01:25:57,174
Team DrC

905
01:25:57,452 --> 01:26:01,650
Tessa, tomorrow morning
we have to go to a place

906
01:26:19,274 --> 01:26:20,798
l'll come now

907
01:26:22,577 --> 01:26:26,035
Team DrC

908
01:26:30,585 --> 01:26:33,577
Let me check
There is no problem at all

909
01:26:35,523 --> 01:26:38,083
Hey fellow don't play on
the bike go, l say

910
01:26:41,563 --> 01:26:43,224
How long have you
started to ride the bike?

911
01:26:44,065 --> 01:26:45,828
Used to go to college on this

912
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:47,729
This was Pappaji's vehicle

913
01:26:51,272 --> 01:26:53,604
On that night, where did
you go with the bike?

914
01:26:58,580 --> 01:27:02,573
Kunjappan chettan used to say,
he enters into each person's life

915
01:27:02,784 --> 01:27:04,012
Unexpectedly

916
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:07,981
Stop the vehicle
Hello

917
01:27:08,623 --> 01:27:11,285
Stop, stop the vehicle
Stop

918
01:27:16,598 --> 01:27:18,566
Hey stop the vehicle

919
01:27:18,866 --> 01:27:20,265
Stop the vehicle

920
01:27:23,304 --> 01:27:24,862
What a speeding is this?

921
01:27:25,006 --> 01:27:27,531
Since he mocked at you, do
you want to speed up like this?

922
01:27:28,676 --> 01:27:31,645
Had a booze that is why,
anyway brothers you may go

923
01:27:38,152 --> 01:27:40,086
Look, l came to say a sorry

924
01:27:40,321 --> 01:27:42,619
l know it is not right to stop a person
from dying without his permission -

925
01:27:42,757 --> 01:27:43,314
- to stop from dying

926
01:27:43,658 --> 01:27:44,784
Because of that, l'm sorry

927
01:27:45,326 --> 01:27:46,953
Now you may go

928
01:27:55,336 --> 01:27:58,032
When you kick with love,
only then it will get started

929
01:28:04,345 --> 01:28:08,281
Look this hanging and jumping in
the sea, that is all old fashioned

930
01:28:08,716 --> 01:28:10,343
Why don't we try something new?

931
01:28:16,190 --> 01:28:17,987
Pal, what a kick it was?

932
01:28:18,693 --> 01:28:21,184
The kidney went up to the brain
now should massage it down!

933
01:28:26,067 --> 01:28:26,931
Look

934
01:28:27,902 --> 01:28:29,164
Have you heard one who was -

935
01:28:29,337 --> 01:28:30,565
- struck by thunder
bolt was bitten by snake?

936
01:28:30,738 --> 01:28:32,365
Most probably that's
going to happen now

937
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:34,566
Why don't we slowly
push off in 'reverse gear?'

938
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:38,309
l don't know to fight with these five
men and walk in slow motion

939
01:28:38,713 --> 01:28:40,874
Come, don't stand here
Come

940
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:52,657
Look we went wrong with the route
how to go to Kanjiramattom?

941
01:28:53,027 --> 01:28:55,120
That you go straight and turn left

942
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:56,695
Okay then
Okay

943
01:28:57,999 --> 01:29:00,627
Great
Are you going?

944
01:29:01,035 --> 01:29:03,162
Don't leave a matured
male alone and go like that

945
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,874
Go straight from here
and drop me at the other side

946
01:29:08,242 --> 01:29:12,611
Foot rest?
lt is very near

947
01:29:14,082 --> 01:29:15,413
lts only about 150 kilometres!

948
01:29:16,284 --> 01:29:17,376
Vattavada!

949
01:29:23,358 --> 01:29:25,087
Okay then

950
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:44,068
My god!

951
01:29:49,784 --> 01:29:51,149
Have you seen the hunter?.

952
01:29:52,453 --> 01:29:53,784
The Orion

953
01:29:55,323 --> 01:29:58,258
Anyway you are going to
die, aren't you? Just watch that

954
01:29:59,127 --> 01:30:00,287
lt is nice

955
01:30:03,097 --> 01:30:04,359
Come on simply watch

956
01:30:08,035 --> 01:30:14,998
Team DrC

957
01:30:22,483 --> 01:30:25,316
Have you seen
snow falling on the hills?

958
01:30:26,521 --> 01:30:28,455
Have you seen magic mushroom?

959
01:30:29,991 --> 01:30:32,687
Without seeing any of these what to
do when you urgently go there?

960
01:30:33,294 --> 01:30:36,752
On reaching there, he'll ask have
you come here, seeing all that?

961
01:30:38,032 --> 01:30:40,330
'HE' has made all
this for us to watch

962
01:30:41,035 --> 01:30:43,401
Simply see all that and
you may go happily

963
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:49,474
l don't know who you are, what
you are and what is your past

964
01:30:49,844 --> 01:30:51,471
Why you tried to
suicide, l don't know all that

965
01:30:52,146 --> 01:30:53,443
Go man, go

966
01:30:54,749 --> 01:30:57,775
Look, new year is over no?
Don't just roam around, go home

967
01:30:58,319 --> 01:30:59,946

971
01:31:09,997 --> 01:31:10,986
Come!

972

976
01:31:32,553 --> 01:31:33,815
Get on it!

01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:48,646
Kannan chetta - Yes madam
Two tea

1005
01:34:49,016 --> 01:34:49,744
Will give now

1006
01:34:50,184 --> 01:34:52,345
Child Rosy, how is the health?

1007
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:54,019
Good
Bye

1008
01:34:58,092 --> 01:35:00,219
Over here no one has
asked about my past

1009
01:35:01,028 --> 01:35:02,723
l had a relationship

1010
01:35:03,764 --> 01:35:05,288
That person has been
studying with me

1011
01:35:06,067 --> 01:35:09,662
One day he came and told he has
got FRCS and wants to go to London

1012
01:35:11,605 --> 01:35:14,130
Told to end this relationship

1013
01:35:14,608 --> 01:35:18,100
We shouldn't dishearten
a person who is careerist

1014
01:35:18,646 --> 01:35:21,342
By saying all the best and
all, had send him happily

1015
01:35:22,049 --> 01:35:24,279
But l was totally depressed

1016
01:35:24,585 --> 01:35:28,681
On that day, it was an independent
operation doing for first time in my life

1017
01:35:29,657 --> 01:35:31,215
The mind got swayed

1018
01:35:32,026 --> 01:35:35,689
A child who was only
10 years old, with my hands..!

1019
01:35:38,332 --> 01:35:40,630
That was a big news
on TV and newspaper

1020
01:35:41,469 --> 01:35:43,767
During that time,
l was 2 months pregnant

1021
01:35:44,138 --> 01:35:46,106
ln that depression, that one also..!

1022
01:35:52,213 --> 01:35:56,445
No matter how much we plan,
the fate of life is beyond that

1023
01:35:58,619 --> 01:36:02,749
On that day, that person
returned to me not only a new life

1024
01:36:04,391 --> 01:36:08,418
''My wife's home is
on the hill of moon''

1025
01:36:09,196 --> 01:36:13,132
''My wife's home is
on the hill of moon''

1026
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:18,030
''On visiting there, will serve
with coffee, black coffee''

1027
01:36:20,541 --> 01:36:23,772
''My wife's home is
on the hill of moon''

1028
01:36:24,178 --> 01:36:26,669
So are you going
by packing everything?

1029
01:36:26,881 --> 01:36:28,280
So, has Kunjappan started
to set terms?

1030
01:36:28,482 --> 01:36:30,848
Comes and goes as he pleases,
that is your kind of terms, no?

1031
01:36:31,185 --> 01:36:33,085
Don't make me talk more

1032
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:38,155
Tighten it well, otherwise all the
nibbles will be spilled inside the bag

1033
01:36:38,893 --> 01:36:45,025
Team DrC

1034
01:36:46,267 --> 01:36:50,533
Madam coffee
lts a coffee made ofjaggery, have it

1035
01:36:51,172 --> 01:36:53,504
You'll be fine
How is the sleep and all?

1036
01:36:54,108 --> 01:36:57,305
Aren't you happy? lt is some
dried fish and smashed meat

1037
01:36:57,545 --> 01:36:59,638
l have got some
8 years old girl friends

1038
01:36:59,914 --> 01:37:01,142
lts forthem

1039
01:37:01,382 --> 01:37:03,816
Then l'm taking leave, will just
roam around 'Kambam and Theni'

1040
01:37:04,185 --> 01:37:05,584
Will straight away head
to 'Ambasamudram'

1041
01:37:06,287 --> 01:37:07,754
By the way, what is doctor's plan?

1042
01:37:11,592 --> 01:37:15,119
When you wish to leave, put the
vehicle in neutral and descend the hill

1043
01:37:16,297 --> 01:37:19,755
My goodness, are you leaving?
Can't you stay for one or two days?

1044
01:37:20,568 --> 01:37:23,162
Then what? Find some other person
to eat Tapioca in a high range

1045
01:37:23,370 --> 01:37:24,632
With some old guys

1046
01:37:24,905 --> 01:37:27,373
Buddy, l'm different buddy
Good, if you want to go-

1047
01:37:27,575 --> 01:37:29,805
- again if you come here
saying wants to eat Tapioca

1048
01:37:30,177 --> 01:37:31,838
Look, man Kunjappa, don't mess up!

1049
01:37:32,146 --> 01:37:34,580
l'll find that Thresia and
marry you off

1050
01:37:34,915 --> 01:37:38,248
Her husband and kids and
grandchildren will come climbing the hill

1051
01:37:38,452 --> 01:37:39,885
Then there won't be
Kunjappan to put the wreath

1052
01:37:40,221 --> 01:37:41,210
That is your..!

1053
01:37:42,623 --> 01:37:43,783
Go man!

1054
01:37:45,426 --> 01:37:48,395
That is bad words, since doctor is
standing here he is muting it and saying

1055
01:37:48,596 --> 01:37:51,224
He is playing with me
Okay then

1056
01:37:55,936 --> 01:37:57,563
One minute

1057
01:38:00,808 --> 01:38:04,710
From here to the nearest government
hospital, it'll take minimum 3 hours

1058
01:38:04,912 --> 01:38:07,506
lf you can, doctor stay
here forfew days

1059
01:38:07,748 --> 01:38:09,579
Try to experience this space

1060
01:38:10,351 --> 01:38:14,412
Sometimes this trick called life,
may get some new dimensions

1061
01:38:15,189 --> 01:38:18,920
Come on don't stand
like this, take a deep breath

1062
01:38:19,293 --> 01:38:20,419
Look, like this

1063
01:38:23,831 --> 01:38:27,733
Come on take it, you don't
have to invest money for that

1064
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:29,435
Simply take it

1065
01:38:38,312 --> 01:38:47,277
Team DrC

1066
01:39:09,009 --> 01:39:11,204
After going on that
day when did he return?

1067
01:39:12,012 --> 01:39:14,674
One night he had come and
dropped Thanya and left

1068
01:39:14,848 --> 01:39:16,475
Then one ortwo phone calls

1069
01:39:17,017 --> 01:39:19,952
But over here, everyone
misses him a lot

1070
01:39:24,992 --> 01:39:28,860
Tessa came all this way to here, on
searching him, who is not met once

1071
01:39:34,868 --> 01:39:41,569
Team DrC

1072
01:39:41,909 --> 01:39:45,811
What is seen is here is only there
l'm a bachelor

1073
01:39:47,014 --> 01:39:51,246
Then one of my naughty friend is
there we both had set up this place

1074
01:39:51,518 --> 01:39:53,782
A shelterfor those
people who has got no one

1075
01:39:57,424 --> 01:40:00,416
Will go?
Why are you going all of a sudden?

1076
01:40:00,961 --> 01:40:03,259
lts a climate better
than Ooty, just tell all that

1077
01:40:03,931 --> 01:40:06,058
Can leave after two days
Must go!

1078
01:40:06,467 --> 01:40:08,332
There is a function at
home next week

1079
01:40:08,535 --> 01:40:10,435
Mummy you may go
down, we'll come now

1080
01:40:14,408 --> 01:40:18,276
This place is his, isn't it?
As per your character -

1081
01:40:18,445 --> 01:40:20,379
- it is not surprising that
you came searching for him

1082
01:40:24,518 --> 01:40:26,713
On coming 27th it is my wedding

1083
01:40:29,423 --> 01:40:32,551
Perhaps in our family you
are the last one to know this

1084
01:40:33,761 --> 01:40:37,595
Hey girl, is it a big fault that l wish
for my wedding you should be present?

1085
01:40:42,136 --> 01:40:45,003
Yeah, Paulosachaya, what is said?

1086
01:40:47,775 --> 01:40:50,710
lf there is any discomfort
we'll shift to another hospital

1087
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:56,447
Grandma is hospitalised
What happened?

1088
01:40:56,650 --> 01:40:58,880
On the previous day there was a
quarrel between Mummy and grandma

1089
01:40:59,086 --> 01:41:00,075
Regarding yourtopic

1090
01:41:00,487 --> 01:41:02,580
That resulted in a
small variation on the BP

1091
01:41:03,424 --> 01:41:04,891
Who is there at the hospital?

1092
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:07,627
Hello Mummy
Haven't you started?

1093
01:41:07,828 --> 01:41:09,523

01:41:24,144 --> 01:41:25,771
All these are new implementations

Today is Kunjappan chettan's
birthday, he is 70 years now

1098
01:41:30,384 --> 01:41:31,112
So what?

1099
01:41:31,518 --> 01:41:35,614
The age will come and go why do
you want to inform that to others?

1100
01:42:03,217 --> 01:42:05,549
Now where will l
go and search him?

1101
01:42:49,630 --> 01:42:51,188
Brother is this water drinkable?

01:44:27,361 --> 01:44:29,295
You are telling you'll make
them run and you are running now

1119
01:44:29,997 --> 01:44:31,794
Hey angel who resides
on the hill top

Are you fine?

1121
01:44:35,569 --> 01:44:37,696
This is Kani, it is

Going to pray by placing the hand

All these years had lived without
any church or clergy people

1126
01:44:49,049 --> 01:44:52,678
My dear Kujapoo, speak low, they
will hear - Telling, so that they can hear

1127
01:44:52,986 --> 01:44:56,080
He comes in, once in a while and
he thinks he can do any nonsense

1128
01:44:57,124 --> 01:45:00,116
Why has he come with everyone?
ls it to do the 'last rituals' for me?

1129
01:45:00,327 --> 01:45:02,921
My Kunjapa, they have
come to pray - To pray..!

1130
01:45:03,697 --> 01:45:05,631
l haven't delegated
anyone, to pray for me

1131
01:45:05,999 --> 01:45:07,626
Then why is he..?

1132
01:45:08,001 --> 01:45:15,840
''Hey Saviour, You are the kindness''

1133
01:45:16,043 --> 01:45:25,850
''Pardon the sins,
You are the divine grace''

1134

Mr. Kunjapps!

1137
01:45:49,042 --> 01:45:50,703
Are you sitting here?

1138
01:45:54,648 --> 01:45:57,845
Kunjappa!
Kunjappa!

1139
01:45:59,886 --> 01:46:02,150
When a person comes to meet,
are you sitting with face turned away?

1140
01:46:03,256 --> 01:46:05,690
This is sister Theraiz Mary

1141
01:46:09,096 --> 01:46:10,893
Forthe last 30 years

1142

1145
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:33,552
Team DrC

1146
01:46:45,399 --> 01:46:49,802
Maruthu, is the tea ready to serve

1147
01:46:50,003 --> 01:46:52,233
Good Tapioca is there

1148
01:46:59,513 --> 01:47:01,208

Tell the matter
Come, come

Do you know who is standing there?

1153
01:47:14,995 --> 01:47:16,223
Which one?
Who is it?

1154
01:47:17,397 --> 01:47:20,798
That old love of Kunjappan is there
no? That was washed off in the flood

1155
01:47:21,001 --> 01:47:22,400
That is the one
My goodness!

1156
01:47:22,769 --> 01:47:24,794
The one and only
Chakupurakal Thresia

1157

My heavens!

1159
01:47:41,087 --> 01:47:44,056
My Christ how difficult was it
to bring the sisters to this place?

1160
01:47:44,357 --> 01:47:47,121
These sisters come for
two weeks visit after 5 or 6 years

1161
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:49,419
When the main father told,
can't take them like that

1162
01:47:49,830 --> 01:47:51,422
l just fell on those feet

1163
01:47:52,032 --> 01:47:55,900
Take that Tapioca, while traveling
through Kudamaloor, Kurishumala

1164
01:47:56,036 --> 01:47:59,164
On deviating there is a place
where lot of old people live

1165
01:47:59,372 --> 01:48:02,933
Just come and pray for them, l
begged and told in the lying posture

1166
01:48:03,410 --> 01:48:05,776
Otherwise, can l
say among these sisters?

1167
01:48:05,912 --> 01:48:08,312
Can l say there is an old Thresia
present who is loved by our Kujappan?

1168
01:48:10,217 --> 01:48:12,845
lmmediately if they hearthat won't
they hook me on the cross?

1169
01:48:14,154 --> 01:48:15,951
Sister Gulothi, you

l hail from Manimala

1171
01:48:18,558 --> 01:48:20,924
On eating Tapioca, if it is to die
means let the death take place

1172
01:48:21,094 --> 01:48:22,356
Sister, if death comes, take it cool

1173
01:48:22,562 --> 01:48:25,360
Along with cross in the cemetery,
l'll place a few Tapioca also

1174
01:48:25,599 --> 01:48:26,896
Then what?

1175
01:48:27,067 --> 01:48:31,868

For few days l was after this,

1187
01:49:40,407 --> 01:49:43,467
Can l sit alone for some time?

1188
01:49:45,512 --> 01:49:51,075
Team DrC

1189
01:49:58,191 --> 01:49:59,886
Sir, you just tell what you want

1190
01:50:00,093 --> 01:50:01,958
Shall l built a 'tree house'
on that big tree?

1191
01:50:02,329 --> 01:50:05,298
Sir, just tell what to do

1192
01:50:06,399 --> 01:50:08,060
All that can be done after l come

1193
01:50:08,935 --> 01:50:10,630
Sir, when you go
when will you come back?

1194
01:50:11,171 --> 01:50:13,435
That is..Come on
Maruthu, have coffee

1195
01:50:13,673 --> 01:50:16,870
Kunjappan chettan, has not opened
the door so far, will it be a problem?

1196
01:50:17,477 --> 01:50:21,504
No problem at all, he'll be completely
in a romantic mood, over there

1197
01:50:21,948 --> 01:50:25,111
Let him sit there and
let him simply enjoy it

1198
01:50:25,385 --> 01:50:26,579
Maruthu, hold this one

1199
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:30,978
What if, if the life ended without
seeing the person who is waited?

1200
01:50:31,191 --> 01:50:33,318
For that only, people like
us are living on this earth

1201
01:50:33,526 --> 01:50:36,256
So, if we wait for a person sincerely -

1202
01:50:36,596 --> 01:50:38,496
- some day that person
will come, won't he?

1203
01:50:38,698 --> 01:50:41,462
Then what?
Where else to go

1204
01:50:42,369 --> 01:50:44,337
Then why are you hiding like this?

1205
01:50:46,673 --> 01:50:50,575
People who hide away from one's
own matters, they chatter like this

1206
01:50:50,944 --> 01:50:54,004
By the way doctor, what is this? As
if prescription of some English medicine

1207
01:50:54,214 --> 01:50:56,205
Can't make out anything
Are you scared?

1208
01:50:57,417 --> 01:50:59,510
Why not? There is a fear whether
cow may come and poke!

1209
01:50:59,719 --> 01:51:01,050
There is a fear whether
coconut may fall on the head

1210
01:51:01,221 --> 01:51:02,688
Are you scared to love?

1211
01:51:06,693 --> 01:51:10,129
When a person says loves
you, how will you react to it?

1212
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:15,994
Where to say?
Who is there to say?

1213
01:51:16,436 --> 01:51:18,370
Suppose if a person says like that

1214
01:51:20,173 --> 01:51:23,404
That is like..
Hey doctor

1215
01:51:24,511 --> 01:51:28,072
When we crash into others life
and when we give some surprises

1216
01:51:28,281 --> 01:51:30,306
That, glow in their
eyes is there, isn't it?

1217
01:51:31,117 --> 01:51:33,585
l just continue to live
on that fun and thrill

1218
01:51:34,587 --> 01:51:38,546
lf some one expects more from
me, that may end up in a problem

1219
01:51:39,426 --> 01:51:42,725
But it doesn't mean that l may end
up doctor in a problem, l'm sure

1220
01:51:44,531 --> 01:51:47,022
Forgot to give the medicine
to Kunjappan chettan - Kani!

1221
01:51:48,535 --> 01:51:50,696
You didn't say the matter
which you were about to say

1222
01:51:54,307 --> 01:51:55,535
Do you know Tessa?

1223
01:51:58,278 --> 01:52:00,405
Had come here
When?

1224
01:52:01,047 --> 01:52:02,241
Was here for two days

1225
01:52:02,549 --> 01:52:05,609
Didn't know you will come
today, left today morning only

1226
01:52:07,153 --> 01:52:08,745
Why is this, cat and mouse play?

1227
01:52:09,422 --> 01:52:11,686
Why do you want to
fool that girl, like this?

1228
01:52:12,659 --> 01:52:16,220
No
l'm not fooling anyone

1229
01:52:18,264 --> 01:52:20,198
Don't take that in a
simple manner like this

1230
01:52:22,535 --> 01:52:25,766
l know
Yeah, l know Tessa

1231
01:52:27,474 --> 01:52:31,171
Everything, searching for
me, staying in that room

1232
01:52:33,346 --> 01:52:35,109
From the stories that
is heard about me

1233
01:52:35,315 --> 01:52:37,476
l don't know what is the
image she has got about me

1234
01:52:37,650 --> 01:52:40,312
lf it were a negative image, that
girl won't come to this place -

1235
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:41,452
- searching for you

1236
01:52:41,621 --> 01:52:44,283
My mother, l'm not there
to argue with doctor

1237
01:52:46,159 --> 01:52:48,184
My life is not disciplined and
systematically arranged

1238
01:52:48,461 --> 01:52:50,622
There is no plan in
particular, simply like this..

1239
01:52:50,697 --> 01:52:54,189
Team DrC

1240
01:52:54,334 --> 01:52:56,302
Still there is a possibility for all that

1241
01:52:56,503 --> 01:52:58,027
During the time of
fever, l have thought

1242
01:52:58,171 --> 01:53:00,196
lf l had a girl as a company

1243
01:53:01,107 --> 01:53:03,098
Can inflict the fever
to one more person

1244
01:53:04,644 --> 01:53:06,612
l'm not saying for an argument

1245
01:53:06,813 --> 01:53:09,304
The only concern is,
what you have shown on me

1246
01:53:09,482 --> 01:53:11,109
That is what l have towards Tessa

1247
01:53:12,552 --> 01:53:16,079
Go and sing that song
to your stupid father, fellows

1248
01:53:16,356 --> 01:53:17,789
Go
Kunjappo!

1249
01:53:20,393 --> 01:53:23,157
l should have send some coffee
powder and tea leaf to them

1250
01:53:23,363 --> 01:53:24,261
To whom?

1251
01:53:26,533 --> 01:53:29,661
They are going back tomorrow, no?

1252
01:53:31,604 --> 01:53:37,372
Shucks! On seeing, l was
perplexed, l couldn't say anything

1253
01:53:37,744 --> 01:53:40,338
Whatever she told,
l didn't hearthat also

1254
01:53:43,483 --> 01:53:44,347
By the way son -

1255
01:53:45,151 --> 01:53:48,518
- perhaps if my Thresia had known
such a person is searching for her

1256
01:53:48,721 --> 01:53:50,279
Maybe if some one had told that

1257
01:53:50,490 --> 01:53:52,253
We might have met long back

1258
01:53:52,492 --> 01:53:53,516
lsn't it?

1259
01:53:56,896 --> 01:53:58,124
lsn't it?

1260
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:01,867
lsn't it?

1261
01:54:09,742 --> 01:54:22,280
Team DrC

1262
01:54:34,667 --> 01:54:35,725
Going!

1263
01:54:36,169 --> 01:54:38,603
When l say bye, then there
will be cries and sentiments

1264
01:54:38,838 --> 01:54:40,271
That will be a big messy

1265
01:54:44,277 --> 01:54:47,178
lf you don't mind, can
you drop me till that bus stop?

1266
01:54:50,650 --> 01:54:52,174
Tomorrow it is our 'Thrissur
Pooram' (Temple festival)

1267
01:54:52,418 --> 01:54:53,908
Doctor, have you participated
in any of the 'Poorams?'

1268
01:54:54,287 --> 01:54:57,381
No
Should just see it what a beauty

1269
01:54:57,557 --> 01:55:00,219
This time there is no 'Pampadi
Rajan' other guy will be there

1270
01:55:00,393 --> 01:55:04,762
'Adiyattu Ayyappa' when stationed
in dark, can't see, so dark in colour

1271
01:55:04,998 --> 01:55:06,590
From there will
head to 'Kunnamkulam'

1272
01:55:06,799 --> 01:55:08,323
Should take the bullet
of lttikora Pappan

1273
01:55:08,534 --> 01:55:11,560
With that bike, heads to 'Katmandu'
through 'Goa, Gokarnam'

1274
01:55:11,838 --> 01:55:15,774
Some of my friends homes
are lost, should help them also

1275
01:55:16,209 --> 01:55:17,642
From there will travel to North East

1276
01:55:18,645 --> 01:55:23,275
Forjust 3 months - so, not
planning to meet that girl, no?

1277
01:55:24,317 --> 01:55:28,378
Here comes again! l thought after
a sleep you'll forget everything

1278
01:55:28,988 --> 01:55:32,185
For you everything is a
child's play, no? Orjust a fun

1279
01:55:34,460 --> 01:55:35,654
Never at all

1280
01:55:36,496 --> 01:55:40,990
Doctor my father has demanded
only one thing during all these years

1281
01:55:41,367 --> 01:55:44,564
That was to meet that girl - Then
why can't you fulfil father's wish?

1282
01:55:49,642 --> 01:55:52,839
Not that, how can l
simply meet that girl?

1283
01:55:53,746 --> 01:55:55,543
While seeing a girl, who has
searched me so long

1284
01:55:55,748 --> 01:55:57,215
There should be some variety, no?

1285
01:55:57,483 --> 01:55:59,610
Only while meeting
like that, it will turn colourful

1286
01:56:03,056 --> 01:56:05,388
There is a person!
Okay right!

1287
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:11,291
Take care of our Kunjappan, my
fear is will he join any Seminary?

1288
01:56:11,431 --> 01:56:12,227
At this age

1289
01:56:15,535 --> 01:56:18,834
Look, let me tell one matter
which is serious, not playful

1290
01:56:20,306 --> 01:56:22,604
Tell Tessa, to come if she has not
seen 'Pooram' (Temple festival)

1291
01:56:22,842 --> 01:56:24,867
l'll be there in the mist of crowd

1292
01:56:26,079 --> 01:56:28,013
Let her find me, if she can

1293
01:56:53,439 --> 01:56:57,705
l know, it is not an easy
task to find a person from there

1294
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:02,671
But there is no other way

1295
01:57:05,551 --> 01:57:08,952
''Beautiful girl..''

1296
01:57:11,924 --> 01:57:15,724
''Beautiful girl..''

1297
01:57:20,366 --> 01:57:23,824
''Hey girl, did you see?''

1298
01:57:27,473 --> 01:57:30,636
''Searching for a person''

1299
01:57:34,113 --> 01:57:36,411
''The heart is withering''

1300
01:57:36,649 --> 01:57:40,415
''Setting fire on the nerves''

1301
01:57:40,987 --> 01:57:47,586
''Without winking the eyes,
who is this girl searching for?''

1302
01:57:47,794 --> 01:57:51,662
''Beautiful girl..''

1303
01:57:57,036 --> 01:58:00,563
By risking the own life,
by knotting the hands and legs

1304
01:58:00,740 --> 01:58:03,573
lnside this box
Pay attention

1305
01:58:06,112 --> 01:58:12,449
From this box, a person who
has knotted his hands and legs

1306
01:58:12,652 --> 01:58:15,815
Within seconds he'll come out

1307
01:58:21,494 --> 01:58:23,587
This is my last item

1308
01:59:22,488 --> 01:59:23,853
Come fast

1309
01:59:40,640 --> 01:59:58,616
Team DrC

1310
02:00:53,646 --> 02:00:54,977
Wasn't it colourful?

1311
02:00:57,016 --> 02:00:58,506
Coming forfirst time to 'Pooram', no?

1312
02:00:59,051 --> 02:01:02,111
Hey Thiru, ready, come
packing everything

1313
02:01:02,321 --> 02:01:04,812
He is my tutor
The great magician

1314
02:01:05,992 --> 02:01:09,689
Not seen her before
l'm also seeing forfirst time

1315
02:01:10,196 --> 02:01:11,163
This is Tessa

1316
02:01:12,064 --> 02:01:14,931
Daughter, your
government stopped arrack

1317
02:01:15,101 --> 02:01:16,295
Stopped the bar

1318
02:01:16,669 --> 02:01:18,330
Do you have anything with you?

1319
02:01:19,338 --> 02:01:22,671
Okay, l'll pack everything and come
Okay go and come

1320
02:01:28,981 --> 02:01:31,711
Why don't we have
a hot, cold lime juice?

1321
02:01:42,762 --> 02:01:48,428
Team DrC

1322
02:01:59,745 --> 02:02:01,872
l'm Sruthi
Sruthi Raman

1323
02:02:06,719 --> 02:02:09,381
Where you expecting anyone else?

1324
02:02:24,670 --> 02:02:26,069
When will the festival begin?

1325
02:02:26,706 --> 02:02:29,038
What?
When will the festival begin?

1326
02:02:30,309 --> 02:02:31,674
Will start now

1327
02:02:33,813 --> 02:02:35,747
Where is Tessa's house?
That you said

1328
02:02:37,149 --> 02:02:39,913
l don't know where your Tessa's
house is, my house is at Pondi

1329
02:02:40,119 --> 02:02:41,677
Pondicherry

1330
02:02:49,395 --> 02:02:51,056
Who is this Tessa?

1331
02:02:51,297 --> 02:02:53,265
Did she dump you?
And ran?

1332
02:02:55,668 --> 02:02:57,397
That is a 'Genie' which is not seen

1333
02:02:59,939 --> 02:03:02,203
With an image which was in my
mind, just made a blind attempt

1334
02:03:02,475 --> 02:03:04,773
l thought you are that girl

1335
02:03:08,247 --> 02:03:11,739
When l ask you a serious
question, would you lie?

1336
02:03:16,722 --> 02:03:17,916
Actually, you are the Tessa, no?

1337
02:03:27,466 --> 02:03:29,900
Come fast, the festival
is about to begin

1338
02:03:30,102 --> 02:03:31,091
Yeah, coming

1339
02:03:35,441 --> 02:03:37,102
Now what is the next plan?

1340
02:03:43,716 --> 02:03:44,876
Alone?

1341
02:03:57,129 --> 02:03:58,721
Will we meet again?

1342
02:04:00,166 --> 02:04:01,793
lf at all seen, will we remember?

1343
02:04:02,902 --> 02:04:04,130
Who knows

1344
02:04:06,105 --> 02:04:08,801
So, why don't we
take a great photo?

1345
02:05:15,074 --> 02:05:27,919
Team DrC

1346
02:06:06,492 --> 02:06:10,189
Sruthi!
The festival!

1347
02:06:13,132 --> 02:06:14,099
Tessa!

1348
02:06:28,280 --> 02:06:29,645
Charlie!

1349
02:07:41,086 --> 02:07:45,716
''Beautiful girl..''

1350
02:07:48,227 --> 02:07:51,162
''Beautiful girl..''

1351
02:07:56,135 --> 02:07:59,468
''Hey girl, did you see?''

1352
02:08:03,242 --> 02:08:06,405
''Searching for a person''

1353
02:08:09,381 --> 02:08:13,010
''Beautiful girl..''

1354
02:08:16,288 --> 02:08:19,985
''Beautiful girl..''
