1
00:00:04,468 --> 00:00:06,469
Thanks for coming to meet me.

2
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,473
I half-thought that Brody guy
was gonna be with you, and

3
00:00:10,508 --> 00:00:11,591
I didn't think you'd want to

4
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:13,259
spend your first Valentine's Day apart.

5
00:00:13,294 --> 00:00:15,094
Yeah, it's actually a little bit
of a point of contention

6
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:16,629
between the two of us.

7
00:00:16,664 --> 00:00:18,114
He was... I don't know,
weirded out,

8
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:19,332
about going to a stranger's wedding,

9
00:00:19,366 --> 00:00:20,867
and so I... Okay.
Okay, cool, cool.

10
00:00:20,918 --> 00:00:22,452
So I-I don't really need to hear
about your new boyfriend

11
00:00:22,486 --> 00:00:24,370
that you're living with, all right?

12
00:00:26,156 --> 00:00:27,440
Finn, what's going on right now?

13
00:00:27,474 --> 00:00:29,175
You look like you
slept in those clothes.

14
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,960
And you won't even look at me.

15
00:00:30,994 --> 00:00:32,595
I kissed Miss Pillsbury.

16
00:00:34,348 --> 00:00:35,465
Did she kiss you back?

17
00:00:35,499 --> 00:00:37,016
No, she was totally freaked out by it.

18
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:38,468
I don't even know how it happened.

19
00:00:38,502 --> 00:00:39,669
We've been spending all this time

20
00:00:39,687 --> 00:00:41,387
together, and then...

21
00:00:41,438 --> 00:00:44,340
she was there, and I just
felt the need to...

22
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:46,809
And I kissed her, and I...

23
00:00:46,843 --> 00:00:48,194
Does Mr. Shue know?

24
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:49,395
I don't... I don't think so.

25
00:00:49,446 --> 00:00:51,314
I don't think she'd tell him, but...

26
00:00:51,348 --> 00:00:52,198
maybe I should.
No.

27
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:54,150
Don't. Just... don't.

28
00:00:54,184 --> 00:00:55,068
Okay?

29
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:56,319
Remember how you felt about Puck

30
00:00:56,353 --> 00:00:57,520
when you found out about him and Quinn?

31
00:00:57,538 --> 00:00:58,655
You kicked a garbage can.

32
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:00,490
I'm the worst person in the world!

33
00:01:00,524 --> 00:01:01,574
No, you're not.

34
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:03,326
What you did, it wasn't

35
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,694
great, but I get it.

36
00:01:04,712 --> 00:01:07,046
You're confused,
and... and lonely.

37
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:08,998
I'm sure that...

38
00:01:09,032 --> 00:01:10,700
just knowing about Brody
and I living together,

39
00:01:10,718 --> 00:01:12,001
it-it set you off.

40
00:01:12,035 --> 00:01:14,053
Not everything has to do with you.

41
00:01:20,394 --> 00:01:21,928
Look, I don't know what to do.

42
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,597
You always wanted to be an actor, right?

43
00:01:24,648 --> 00:01:25,765
So here's your chance to play the role

44
00:01:25,816 --> 00:01:26,933
of the supportive best man.

45
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,111

46
00:01:39,613 --> 00:01:40,830
(school bell ringing)

47
00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:43,750
Um...

48
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:46,836
Oh, God...

49
00:01:49,573 --> 00:01:51,758
I'd feel a lot more comfortable

50
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:53,593
if this door stayed open.
The whole wall

51
00:01:53,627 --> 00:01:55,712
is glass, and there's like
50 kids walking by.

52
00:01:55,746 --> 00:01:57,079
I don't have time for this, Finn.

53
00:01:57,097 --> 00:01:58,381
Seriously, this seating chart

54
00:01:58,415 --> 00:01:59,766
is like a giant sudoku.

55
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,883
Will wants his mother
as far away from the bar

56
00:02:00,917 --> 00:02:02,101
as possible, and all of you Glee kids

57
00:02:02,136 --> 00:02:03,770
have dated so incestuously that I can't

58
00:02:03,804 --> 00:02:05,221
even remember who can tolerate
who anymore, so...

59
00:02:05,255 --> 00:02:07,223
Look, I'm-I'm worried
about not being able

60
00:02:07,257 --> 00:02:09,892
to do this. Being able to look
Mr. Shue in the eyes. I...

61
00:02:09,926 --> 00:02:11,561
Look, I'm really sorry

62
00:02:11,595 --> 00:02:13,229
that I don't have a pamphlet
handy for you right now,

63
00:02:13,263 --> 00:02:15,231
but I'm pretty sure if I did,
it would say something like,

64
00:02:15,265 --> 00:02:17,784
"Get Over It," okay?

65
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:19,452
My therapist says that I use my OCD

66
00:02:19,486 --> 00:02:21,904
to control the uncontrollable.
Ever since I was

67
00:02:21,938 --> 00:02:24,073
a little kid, I would plan
and plan and plan all

68
00:02:24,107 --> 00:02:25,458
my birthday parties
but never actually went through

69
00:02:25,492 --> 00:02:26,909
with any of them
because they were never ready

70
00:02:26,943 --> 00:02:28,995
by the time my birthday
actually rolled around.

71
00:02:29,046 --> 00:02:31,581
I just wanted to help you. Look,
when I get on that altar,

72
00:02:31,615 --> 00:02:33,299
and I make my solemn vows for the second

73
00:02:33,334 --> 00:02:35,585
and, I hope, the very last time,

74
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:38,120
standing right behind my husband
will be his best man.

75
00:02:38,138 --> 00:02:41,140
That's you... the guy who thought
it was okay to kiss me

76
00:02:41,175 --> 00:02:42,308
a week before my wedding.

77
00:02:42,343 --> 00:02:43,593
The guy who is forcing me

78
00:02:43,627 --> 00:02:44,927
to lie to my fiancé.

79
00:02:44,961 --> 00:02:47,180
And if you really want to help me,

80
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:51,100
then just keep a wide berth
and keep your mouth shut.

81
00:02:51,134 --> 00:02:53,436
How's my nervous

82
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,771
little bride doing?

83
00:02:54,805 --> 00:02:56,189
Um, good, I just, I just

84
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,490
really could use some
help with this seating...

85
00:02:57,524 --> 00:02:59,025
Right after Glee practice, I promise.

86
00:03:01,695 --> 00:03:03,496
Okay.

87
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,531
Come on, Finn.

88
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,952
Okay.

89
00:03:09,986 --> 00:03:11,788
(school bell ringing) Glee Club!

90
00:03:11,822 --> 00:03:14,290
(applause, cheering,
whistling and chatter)

91
00:03:14,324 --> 00:03:15,958
Mr. Shue, how was D.C.?

92
00:03:15,992 --> 00:03:19,212
D.C. was great,
but now I am back to stay.

93
00:03:19,263 --> 00:03:21,297
Holla! And so, for my
first order of business,

94
00:03:21,331 --> 00:03:24,183
I want to give a big shout-out
to the guy who made sure

95
00:03:24,218 --> 00:03:27,002
I had something to come back
to... Mr. Finn Hudson.

96
00:03:27,021 --> 00:03:29,022
(cheering and applause)

97
00:03:29,056 --> 00:03:32,392
Now... for this week's
assignment...

98
00:03:32,443 --> 00:03:33,526
I hope it's Britney again.

99
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,528
ALL:
Oh!

100
00:03:35,562 --> 00:03:37,530
Ha, ha, ha!

101
00:03:37,564 --> 00:03:40,733
Miss Pillsbury and I are finally
getting married.

102
00:03:40,784 --> 00:03:42,035
Yeah!
Which makes me the happiest,

103
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:43,403
luckiest man alive.

104
00:03:43,454 --> 00:03:45,238
Now, Emma has been
handling all the prep,

105
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:47,156
so to help out,
I thought I'd take charge

106
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,741
of the entertainment for the reception.

107
00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:50,410
And though this goes against tradition,

108
00:03:50,461 --> 00:03:52,745
it would mean the world
to me and to Emma

109
00:03:52,796 --> 00:03:55,331
if, instead of giving your
best man's speech, Finn,

110
00:03:55,365 --> 00:03:56,966
you sing for us.

111
00:03:58,435 --> 00:03:59,502
What do you think?

112
00:03:59,536 --> 00:04:03,506
Uh... uh, yeah, of course.

113
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,874
Perfect.
(laughs)

114
00:04:04,892 --> 00:04:07,009
For everyone else who isn't
out with Asian bird flu...

115
00:04:07,043 --> 00:04:08,244
It wasn't me.

116
00:04:08,278 --> 00:04:09,679
...it's a Valentine's
Day wedding, which means,

117
00:04:09,713 --> 00:04:10,847
we need some great romantic

118
00:04:10,881 --> 00:04:12,098
love songs at the reception.

119
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:14,267
Wait. You want <i>us</i>
to be your wedding singers?

120
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:16,018
That is so...
Awesome.

121
00:04:16,052 --> 00:04:17,186
We'd be honored.

122
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,054
Great. I have
some great ideas.

123
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:22,575
(school bell ringing) Oh.

124
00:04:22,609 --> 00:04:24,077
So, her name is Betty.

125
00:04:24,111 --> 00:04:25,695
She's gonna be sitting next to you.

126
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:29,082
She's my niece, she's blonde,
she's an amazing singer,

127
00:04:29,116 --> 00:04:32,201
and she has...
um, very large, uh...

128
00:04:32,235 --> 00:04:33,119
Feet?

129
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,036
Boobies.

130
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,538
Oh. Oh, my.

131
00:04:35,572 --> 00:04:37,072
(laughs, clears throat)

132
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:38,374
Uh, Miss Pillsbury,

133
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:39,926
are you okay?
What, me? Yeah, I'm fine.

134
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,094
Your locker's not, though.

135
00:04:41,128 --> 00:04:42,261
It's flu season.

136
00:04:42,296 --> 00:04:43,629
I can practically see the virus

137
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,047
growing in here.

138
00:04:45,081 --> 00:04:47,266
I'm sorry. It's just
a little bit

139
00:04:47,301 --> 00:04:49,135
of residual wedding stress.

140
00:04:49,186 --> 00:04:51,053
Nothing that any bride wouldn't feel

141
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:52,054
this close to her big day, though.

142
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:52,855
Right?

143
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:59,929
So, I know it's not
Valentine's Day yet, but

144
00:04:59,947 --> 00:05:02,949
I wanted you to open this now.

145
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,821
They're cuff links.

146
00:05:08,872 --> 00:05:10,339
I made it myself from
this old typewriter

147
00:05:10,374 --> 00:05:12,074
my mom and I found at a garage sale.

148
00:05:12,108 --> 00:05:13,910
I just wanted you to have them early

149
00:05:13,944 --> 00:05:15,962
so you could wear them
to Mr. Shue's wedding.

150
00:05:15,996 --> 00:05:18,831
These are so cool, but I can't
wait to give you your gift.

151
00:05:18,882 --> 00:05:20,299
You're gonna love it.

152
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:21,918
I love it already,
I don't care what it is.

153
00:05:21,952 --> 00:05:24,003
I'll meet you after Spanish class, okay?

154
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,977
Dude, you did get her something, right?

155
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:34,013
Not yet, but I've got some ideas.

156
00:05:34,064 --> 00:05:36,098
I've been brainstorming with my brother.

157
00:05:36,132 --> 00:05:38,267
You said she has some kind
of eating disorder thing, right?

158
00:05:38,301 --> 00:05:40,520
Yeah. Take her out to dinner.
Save a bunch of cash.

159
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:41,988
Then you can use that extra money

160
00:05:42,022 --> 00:05:43,489
to buy a ton of different lingerie.

161
00:05:43,524 --> 00:05:46,692
Have her put on a fashion show.
Chicks love fashion.

162
00:05:46,743 --> 00:05:48,611
Dude, I know you're, like,
related to that guy,

163
00:05:48,645 --> 00:05:50,980
but he's kind of creepy and
currently dating a sophomore.

164
00:05:50,998 --> 00:05:53,282
All right, I'm not
letting you do any of that.

165
00:05:53,316 --> 00:05:54,784
Dude, I don't know about this stuff.

166
00:05:54,818 --> 00:05:56,819
Okay, those are the
only ideas that I had.

167
00:05:56,837 --> 00:05:58,454
You want to do something romantic.

168
00:05:58,488 --> 00:06:00,790
Something she's gonna remember
for the rest of her life.

169
00:06:00,824 --> 00:06:03,292
Well, it's not like I can afford
diamond earrings or a Bentley.

170
00:06:03,326 --> 00:06:04,961
It's not how much money you put into it.

171
00:06:04,995 --> 00:06:07,547
It's about how much of <i>you</i>
you put it into it.

172
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:08,831
Well, you got some ideas?

173
00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:11,000
A bunch, which is why
you're going to forget

174
00:06:11,018 --> 00:06:15,154
about Valentine's <i>Day</i>
and make it Valentine's <i>Week.</i>

175
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:17,139
Genius.
Mm-hmm.

176
00:06:17,173 --> 00:06:19,141
Thank you. Say hi to
Mrs. Sanchez for me.

177
00:06:19,175 --> 00:06:21,143
Okay. (Sighs)

178
00:06:21,177 --> 00:06:23,178
(school bell ringing)

179
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,151
Where have you been? I asked
you to come, like, an hour ago.

180
00:06:29,185 --> 00:06:30,820
I was getting a spray-tan.
Mr. Shue asked me

181
00:06:30,854 --> 00:06:32,655
to sing him a song as my best man toast.

182
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:35,157
So far, I've narrowed it down
to "Confessions" by Usher,

183
00:06:35,191 --> 00:06:38,995
"My Best Friend's Girl," and
"Lyin' Eyes" by the Eagles.

184
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:40,997
I can't... I can't go through with this.
You're gonna

185
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:42,665
be fine, all right? I'll sing
with you. We can do a duet.

186
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:44,333
I'll take the lead, and you can just

187
00:06:44,367 --> 00:06:45,668
sway in the background.

188
00:06:45,702 --> 00:06:48,588
Right. Well, I think
the real issue here is,

189
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,756
whether or not
you can handle singing with me.

190
00:06:50,807 --> 00:06:53,509
I mean, we do have some pretty
dangerous musical chemistry.

191
00:06:53,543 --> 00:06:56,345
I think I can control myself.

192
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:59,599
Although, I will admit,
you do look very cute right now.

193
00:07:01,652 --> 00:07:03,636
I've been dieting.

194
00:07:07,557 --> 00:07:09,108
I'll pick out a song.
(clears throat)

195
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:11,027
(school bell ringing)

196
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:13,195
WILL: So eagles sit at the
top of the food chain.

197
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:14,447
Their lifting power
is about four pounds.

198
00:07:14,498 --> 00:07:16,365
It's like a small baby.

199
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:18,200
Okay, what is going on with you?

200
00:07:18,234 --> 00:07:20,202
Did you buy more of those
11-hour energy shots?

201
00:07:20,236 --> 00:07:21,921
Because there's a reason
they're illegal in Canada.

202
00:07:21,955 --> 00:07:23,756
Nothing's going on.
What could be going on?

203
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,241
It's history class.

204
00:07:27,294 --> 00:07:29,211
(whispering) All right.

205
00:07:29,245 --> 00:07:31,097
WILL: Jacob, you've
got the floor.

206
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:32,431
Hello. This is kind of
embarrassing,

207
00:07:32,466 --> 00:07:34,300
but...
Jake, what are you doing?!

208
00:07:34,351 --> 00:07:35,635
Are you really standing up

209
00:07:35,686 --> 00:07:36,552
in front of everyone

210
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:37,637
and singing to prove your love

211
00:07:37,688 --> 00:07:38,638
for Marley?

212
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:40,723
Yes, Ryder. Yes, I am. Wow.

213
00:07:40,757 --> 00:07:42,708
That's so crazy and
emotionally vulnerable.

214
00:07:42,743 --> 00:07:44,126
I had no idea.

215
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:45,328
Oh, wait.

216
00:07:45,362 --> 00:07:47,880
Yes, I did.
Yes, I did.

217
00:07:47,914 --> 00:07:49,882
Marley, I know this is one
of your favorite songs,

218
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,384
so this is for you.

219
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:53,552

That was amazing.

You like it?
Oh, my God.

271
00:10:14,895 --> 00:10:15,694
(indistinct chatter)

272
00:10:15,729 --> 00:10:16,862
She liked it.

273
00:10:16,897 --> 00:10:18,397
MARLEY:
That was so romantic.

274
00:10:18,448 --> 00:10:20,449
(indistinct chatter)

275
00:10:26,494 --> 00:10:27,711
(sighs)

276
00:10:27,745 --> 00:10:29,580
It is a Carrot Top convention.

277
00:10:35,003 --> 00:10:37,387
I am so over this,
and it hasn't even started yet.

278
00:10:37,422 --> 00:10:39,339
I'm clearly the hottest bitch
in this lousy joint,

279
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,308
but I'm all alone,
stuck here sitting with you.

280
00:10:41,342 --> 00:10:42,976
Do you want me to slap you again?

281
00:10:43,011 --> 00:10:45,729
I hate weddings,
and I hate Valentine's Day.

282
00:10:45,763 --> 00:10:47,981
They were invented by breeders
to sell cheap chocolate

283
00:10:48,016 --> 00:10:49,266
and false hope.

284
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,767
Do you know what <i>I</i> hate?

285
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:52,152
Men. Every single

286
00:10:52,187 --> 00:10:55,489
one of them is a pig, except
maybe Mr. Shue and Al Roker.

287
00:10:55,523 --> 00:10:57,157
And you know what?
You were right.

288
00:10:57,192 --> 00:10:59,326
I do let men define me, but not anymore.

289
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,528
Like Gloria Steinem said,
"A woman without a man

290
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:03,330
is like a fish
without a bicycle."

291
00:11:03,364 --> 00:11:06,283
Al Roker is disgusting, by the way.

292
00:11:06,317 --> 00:11:08,435
(scoffs) Whatever.

293
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:20,697
Hi. Betty?

294
00:11:20,731 --> 00:11:22,366
Yes? Oh, God.

295
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,586
What? Did I beat you to
the last handicap spot? Sorry.

296
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,205
I'm Artie. Miss Pillsbury said I
should look out for you? (Groans)

297
00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:29,706
Hell, no.
Uh...

298
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,708
No.
Uh...

299
00:11:31,742 --> 00:11:36,096
No. Wheel away. Wheel...
the hell... away.

300
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,882
My aunt told me she was fixing
me up with someone good-looking,

301
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,301
so that was a lie.

302
00:11:41,352 --> 00:11:44,638
Oh. I mean, some people think
I'm kind of nerdy-hot, so...

303
00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:45,639
No, no, no.

304
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,641
Andrew Garfield
is nerdy-hot.

305
00:11:47,692 --> 00:11:50,060
You are Stephen Hawking's
younger brother.

306
00:11:50,094 --> 00:11:52,262
Miss Pillsbury didn't tell you
I was in a wheelchair, did she?

307
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,232
Um, obviously not, because
I don't date losers in chairs.

308
00:11:55,266 --> 00:11:57,234
But you're in a wheelchair.
Yeah,

309
00:11:57,268 --> 00:12:00,437
I'm also blonde, captain of the
cheerleaders at my high school,

310
00:12:00,455 --> 00:12:02,706
and I've got this going on.

311
00:12:04,609 --> 00:12:06,410
JAKE:
<i>You first.</i>

312
00:12:06,444 --> 00:12:08,078
Thank you, sir.
Yep.

313
00:12:08,112 --> 00:12:10,998
Oh, my gosh, Jake.
Are these for me?

314
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:13,000
Yes?

315
00:12:13,051 --> 00:12:14,451
How did you know I love peonies?

316
00:12:14,469 --> 00:12:16,253
They're the queen of flowers.

317
00:12:16,287 --> 00:12:18,922
RYDER: Because you mentioned
it in the choir room once,

318
00:12:18,956 --> 00:12:20,957
and Jake remembered.
Right, dude?

319
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:24,127
Right. Yeah.
I love them.

320
00:12:24,145 --> 00:12:26,146
And you.

321
00:12:28,966 --> 00:12:30,967
(whispering):
Thank you.

322
00:12:34,805 --> 00:12:36,273
(moaning)

323
00:12:36,307 --> 00:12:38,442
Had I known I was gonna get
groped in the back of a Prius,

324
00:12:38,476 --> 00:12:39,976
I would've brought a change of clothes.

325
00:12:39,994 --> 00:12:42,479
I'm gonna go in there looking
like <i>Prom: The Morning After.</i>

326
00:12:42,497 --> 00:12:43,947
(moaning) What am I doing?

327
00:12:43,981 --> 00:12:45,449
I'm sort of dating somebody in New York.

328
00:12:45,483 --> 00:12:47,868
Uh, you're not in New York.
And it's not exclusive, right?

329
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,538
You in this fey boy-tie...
it's my Kryptonite.

330
00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:53,790
(moaning) Wait, this doesn't mean
that we're back together, right?

331
00:12:53,824 --> 00:12:56,326
No, no, no. It's-it's cool.
I know, I know. It's-it's...

332
00:12:56,344 --> 00:12:59,379
This is just bros helping bros.
I love it when you talk fratty.

333
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,632
(moaning)

334
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:02,999
Tell me that's not Tina again!

335
00:13:03,017 --> 00:13:05,469
Hey, can you two wrap
it up? The wedding is

336
00:13:05,503 --> 00:13:07,971
about to start,
and I need my arm-gays.

337
00:13:08,005 --> 00:13:11,007
(shuddering) Oh, my God.

338
00:13:13,528 --> 00:13:16,813
You do realize how trashy
blasphemous this is, right?

339
00:13:16,847 --> 00:13:19,366
Mercedes, everyone hooks
up at weddings. Mm-hmm.

340
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,353
Let's go. This outfit needs an audience.
(church bells ringing)

341
00:13:26,357 --> 00:13:28,024
(door opens)

342
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,863
Oh, my God.

343
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:35,832
What are you wearing?
What?

344
00:13:35,866 --> 00:13:38,034
This old thing? Why,
it's an exact replica

345
00:13:38,052 --> 00:13:39,336
of your wedding dress.

346
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,504
Why would you do that?

347
00:13:40,538 --> 00:13:42,222
To get back at Will
Schuester for handing

348
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:44,691
a teaching position to
a flabby 19-year-old.

349
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:48,195
(Emma hyperventilating)

350
00:13:48,246 --> 00:13:51,531
Um... Sue, I feel really scared.

351
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:53,000
I feel really overwhelmed.

352
00:13:53,034 --> 00:13:54,167
I feel like I can't

353
00:13:54,202 --> 00:13:56,119
think straight. I'm just
really, really worried

354
00:13:56,153 --> 00:13:57,337
that this isn't gonna work.

355
00:13:57,372 --> 00:13:58,755
Well, of course it isn't going to work.

356
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,957
You're a weird bird-lady
with a hollow pelvis

357
00:14:00,991 --> 00:14:03,043
and OCD, and Will Schuester

358
00:14:03,094 --> 00:14:05,295
is a weepy man-child
whose greatest joy in life

359
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:07,347
is singing with children
and whose best friend

360
00:14:07,382 --> 00:14:08,632
is 19. It's just, the last time

361
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,517
was such a disaster.
You know, I-I turned

362
00:14:10,551 --> 00:14:12,185
into somebody
that I didn't even recognize.

363
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,221
If I'm wrong again,

364
00:14:14,272 --> 00:14:16,023
I won't survive.
Well,

365
00:14:16,057 --> 00:14:17,357
don't say that to Will Schuester.

366
00:14:17,392 --> 00:14:18,358
He'll have you singing

367
00:14:18,393 --> 00:14:19,860
a stripped-down acoustic version

368
00:14:19,894 --> 00:14:22,145
of "I Will Survive" in front of
a choir room full of teenagers

369
00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:23,814
with meaningful looks on their faces.

370
00:14:23,848 --> 00:14:24,981
God, I can't breathe.

371
00:14:25,015 --> 00:14:26,366
I can't breathe.

372
00:14:26,401 --> 00:14:27,818
I don't feel like there's
any air in here.

373
00:14:27,852 --> 00:14:28,919
(sighs)

374
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:33,573

(Richard Wagner's
"Bridal Chorus" playing)

425
00:16:58,436 --> 00:17:00,720
(door opens)

426
00:17:22,743 --> 00:17:25,161
(organ stops abruptly) (attendees gasp)

427
00:17:25,195 --> 00:17:27,414
(indistinct chatter)

428
00:17:27,465 --> 00:17:31,501
(chuckling)

429
00:17:31,535 --> 00:17:34,254
Oh, yeah. Nice to see you all.
(clicks tongue)

430
00:17:34,305 --> 00:17:36,056
Hey, what do you think?

431
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,891
Nice, huh?

432
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:39,259
Thank you for coming.

433
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,094
Oh, look, it's all the Glee kids.

434
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:42,646
(mouthing)

435
00:17:46,684 --> 00:17:49,102
Sue. What are you doing?

436
00:17:49,153 --> 00:17:52,772
(quietly): I'm trying to
stop this from becoming

437
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:54,824
an utter fiasco.

438
00:17:57,612 --> 00:18:00,163
Emma's left the building.

439
00:18:00,197 --> 00:18:03,116
(church bell ringing)

440
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:13,461
So, did she give you any idea
why she might do this?

441
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:16,064
I mean, like, leading up
to today, did she...

442
00:18:16,098 --> 00:18:19,300
tell you anything or... She
didn't have to tell me anything.

443
00:18:19,318 --> 00:18:21,186
I left her with all this...

444
00:18:21,237 --> 00:18:23,805
stress and planning.
She was losing it and

445
00:18:23,823 --> 00:18:27,025
I kept telling her that it was
her usual obsessiveness. I...

446
00:18:27,076 --> 00:18:28,610
Yeah, but she left you
at the altar, man.

447
00:18:28,644 --> 00:18:30,195
I mean, that's pretty hard-core.

448
00:18:30,246 --> 00:18:32,213
(sighs)

449
00:18:32,248 --> 00:18:34,082
You think there is something else?

450
00:18:34,116 --> 00:18:35,367
Do you think there's...

451
00:18:35,418 --> 00:18:37,035
do you think there's someone else?

452
00:18:37,086 --> 00:18:39,487
(footsteps approaching) (cough)

453
00:18:39,505 --> 00:18:42,707
I have been chosen,
probably because I'm numb

454
00:18:42,758 --> 00:18:44,709
to other people's feelings,
to come here and ask

455
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,044
what you would like
to do, Mr. Shue.

456
00:18:46,095 --> 00:18:47,161
About what?

457
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:48,329
Uh, about the reception.

458
00:18:48,364 --> 00:18:49,664
Miss Pillsbury's parents say

459
00:18:49,682 --> 00:18:51,549
they paid for the whole thing, so...

460
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,468
we might as well go ahead
and have the party and...

461
00:18:53,502 --> 00:18:55,387
if you ask me, they seem pretty
happy about what happened.

462
00:18:55,438 --> 00:18:58,172
We can't have a reception now.
Sure you can.

463
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,225
All of you came back,
you should be together.

464
00:19:00,276 --> 00:19:02,677
Just because I ruined my Valentine's Day

465
00:19:02,695 --> 00:19:04,846
doesn't mean I have
to ruin all of yours, too.

466
00:19:10,202 --> 00:19:12,871
I'm gonna go see if I can find Emma.

467
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,959
("Dance Hall Days" by Wang Chung
playing)

468
00:19:21,714 --> 00:19:23,715
Let's go.

469
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,336
(speaking indistinctly)

470
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,095
We all should've known that
a Valentine's Day wedding

471
00:19:37,146 --> 00:19:39,097
was just asking for a disaster.

472
00:19:39,148 --> 00:19:40,482
Love stinks.

473
00:19:40,516 --> 00:19:42,717
Sorry, ladies,
can I see some I.D.?

474
00:19:42,735 --> 00:19:44,102
SANTANA:
I'm 25. Name's Rosario Cruz.

475
00:19:44,153 --> 00:19:45,553
I might be related to Penelope.

476
00:19:45,571 --> 00:19:47,439
You? Emily Stark. Barely legal.

477
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,658
Well, that's good, 'cause I hear
your professors are into that.

478
00:19:50,693 --> 00:19:52,610
You know, we always were two ends

479
00:19:52,661 --> 00:19:54,662
of the same bitch-goddess
spectrum.

480
00:19:54,697 --> 00:19:56,531
Maybe that's why we love
each other so much.

481
00:19:56,565 --> 00:19:58,533
And slap each other.
(chuckles)

482
00:19:58,567 --> 00:20:00,785
You know, I have to say, Rosario,

483
00:20:00,836 --> 00:20:02,837
you are killing it in that dress.

484
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:06,458
Thanks.

485
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:09,511
Those romantic saps.
You know, they may have love,

486
00:20:09,545 --> 00:20:10,795
but you know what we are
that they are not?

487
00:20:10,846 --> 00:20:12,964
Flawless.

488
00:20:13,015 --> 00:20:15,016
♪ I said

489
00:20:16,685 --> 00:20:18,636
♪ Dance hall, dance hall...

490
00:20:18,687 --> 00:20:20,688
I'm gonna go dance.

491
00:20:21,941 --> 00:20:24,592
Dude, you are like some kind
of love genius.

492
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,861
Do you spend all your time
watching Lifetime?

493
00:20:26,896 --> 00:20:29,314
Marley has... a wicked case
of Puckerman fever,

494
00:20:29,365 --> 00:20:31,649
and I just need one more act
of romantic awesomeness

495
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,985
to make the condition fatal.

496
00:20:34,036 --> 00:20:36,738
Do you think maybe just one of
these gifts should be your idea?

497
00:20:36,772 --> 00:20:38,990
No, my ideas suck. I mean,
I tried to write her a poem,

498
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,775
and the only words
that I could come up with

499
00:20:40,793 --> 00:20:44,779
to rhyme with Marley
was "barley" and "gnarly."

500
00:20:44,797 --> 00:20:48,750
Here. It's a heart pendant
from the jeweler at the mall.

501
00:20:48,784 --> 00:20:50,668
It's pretty but it's not too expensive,

502
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:52,620
so she won't think you stole it.

503
00:20:52,638 --> 00:20:55,507
Okay, I'm going to ignore
the subtly racist overtones

504
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:58,009
of that comment because you are my hero.

505
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,061
And this is perfect.

506
00:21:00,095 --> 00:21:03,515
I am so getting laid tonight.
What?

507
00:21:03,566 --> 00:21:06,184
Well, I mean, Marley has
wanted to take things slow,

508
00:21:06,235 --> 00:21:08,353
and we have, which is fine, but...

509
00:21:08,404 --> 00:21:10,638
I mean, all this romance
is like nitrous.

510
00:21:10,656 --> 00:21:13,525
I got us a room upstairs
just in case, but...

511
00:21:13,576 --> 00:21:15,527

It was fun, but...
Don't.

749
00:32:58,829 --> 00:33:00,830
I'm not gonna let you
minimize this, Kurt.

750
00:33:00,864 --> 00:33:02,748
It's no accident that we were together

751
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,967
on Christmas and again
on Valentine's Day.

752
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:08,036

for many, many more,

no matter how much you pretend

754
00:33:10,223 --> 00:33:12,391
that this doesn't mean anything.

755
00:33:15,011 --> 00:33:17,680

757
00:33:21,484 --> 00:33:22,685

761
00:33:37,367 --> 00:33:38,567
And thank God they do.

762
00:33:38,585 --> 00:33:40,536
You know, it was fun,
and I've always wondered

763
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:42,321
what it would be like
to be with a woman,

764
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:43,956
but, uh, I don't know.
I think for me

765
00:33:44,007 --> 00:33:45,291
it was more of a one-time thing.

766
00:33:45,342 --> 00:33:46,625
Look, you don't have to worry.

767
00:33:46,676 --> 00:33:49,712
I'm not going to show up
at your house with a U-Haul.

768
00:33:49,746 --> 00:33:51,747
(laughs)

769
00:33:53,383 --> 00:33:54,633
So what happens next?

770
00:33:54,684 --> 00:33:57,519
Well, you could walk out first.

771
00:33:57,554 --> 00:34:00,723
Or we could make it
a two-time thing?

772
00:34:04,361 --> 00:34:06,312
Was it good for you?

773
00:34:06,363 --> 00:34:08,847
I don't know. You?

774
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:11,166
No idea.

775
00:34:11,201 --> 00:34:13,202
(both laughing)

776
00:34:16,606 --> 00:34:20,376
(sighs) I'm sorry. Eh, don't be.

777
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:23,162
But you spent so much money on this room.
No, I didn't.

778
00:34:23,213 --> 00:34:25,164
I just snagged a key card
from the maid's cart

779
00:34:25,215 --> 00:34:26,582
and tried every door till one opened.

780
00:34:26,616 --> 00:34:29,051
Are you serious?
No.

781
00:34:29,085 --> 00:34:31,053
(laughs)

782
00:34:31,087 --> 00:34:33,672
Come on. Can we at least
make it back downstairs

783
00:34:33,723 --> 00:34:36,175
for another dance?

784
00:34:36,226 --> 00:34:38,227
Let's go.

785
00:35:05,467 --> 00:35:07,267
Hello? My God.

786
00:35:07,302 --> 00:35:08,936
This is amazing.

787
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:11,305
Just a little something
I threw together.

788
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:13,774
Only took two whole days,
but you're worth it.

789
00:35:13,808 --> 00:35:15,275
Thank you.

790
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:18,612
I felt bad about us not being together

791
00:35:18,646 --> 00:35:20,814
on Valentine's Day, but since, uh,

792
00:35:20,848 --> 00:35:24,618
Kurt and Santana are out until tomorrow,

793
00:35:24,652 --> 00:35:26,787
I thought we could take advantage.

794
00:35:31,326 --> 00:35:33,193
Did you kiss somebody else
when you were away?

795
00:35:33,211 --> 00:35:36,129
You're kissing differently.
What if I did?

796
00:35:36,164 --> 00:35:38,966
I thought we were in a modern and
open relationship. Yeah, we are.

797
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,001
But, I mean, the key is
that we are honest

798
00:35:41,035 --> 00:35:42,636
with each other
with everything that we do.

799
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,805
So, did you see Finn?

800
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:46,673
Finn's fine.
He lives in Ohio.

801
00:35:46,707 --> 00:35:48,708
And I live here with you.

802
00:35:48,726 --> 00:35:50,710
Cool?

803
00:35:50,728 --> 00:35:52,679
Like a cucumber.
(laughs)

804
00:35:52,713 --> 00:35:55,098
Thank you for being honest with me.

805
00:35:56,684 --> 00:35:59,019
Well, speaking of being
honest, what about you, huh?

806
00:35:59,053 --> 00:36:01,388
Mm-hmm. Who did you see?
Who did you do?

807
00:36:01,406 --> 00:36:02,823
Sure there are a lot lonely girls

808
00:36:02,857 --> 00:36:04,191
in New York City on Valentine's Day.

809
00:36:04,225 --> 00:36:08,629
I stayed at home and watched
weightlifting videos.

810
00:36:15,403 --> 00:36:17,571
Well, thank you for
being honest with me.

811
00:36:19,374 --> 00:36:21,741
Care to join me in the bedroom?

812
00:36:21,759 --> 00:36:23,544
(sighs)

813
00:36:23,578 --> 00:36:25,345
Is it okay if I pass tonight?

814
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,913
I have airplane belly.

815
00:36:26,931 --> 00:36:28,915
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Of course.

816
00:36:28,933 --> 00:36:31,869
I am kind of worn out
from the night before you left.

817
00:36:31,903 --> 00:36:34,571
Okay, so, couch time and... Yes!

818
00:36:34,622 --> 00:36:36,189
...I will get
some popcorn.

819
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:40,377
I'm glad to have you back.

820
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:41,528
I genuinely missed you.

821
00:36:48,636 --> 00:36:50,804
(school bell ringing) Before
you say anything, I'm sorry.

822
00:36:50,838 --> 00:36:52,973
I'm sorry that I attacked
you at the reception.

823
00:36:53,007 --> 00:36:55,392
It's just, I saw you up
there, singing with Blaine,

824
00:36:55,426 --> 00:36:57,728
and I saw the old, legendary chemistry.

825
00:36:57,762 --> 00:36:59,846
I saw two soul mates
rediscovering each other,

826
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,765
and I was jealous.

827
00:37:01,816 --> 00:37:03,600
Why couldn't that be me?

828
00:37:03,651 --> 00:37:05,152
Why can't I have that with someone?

829
00:37:05,186 --> 00:37:06,570
You will, just not with me.

830
00:37:06,604 --> 00:37:08,572
I'm sorry that I've been
throwing myself at you,

831
00:37:08,606 --> 00:37:10,274
making a fool of myself,

832
00:37:10,325 --> 00:37:12,409
hoping for something
I know can never be.

833
00:37:12,443 --> 00:37:13,694
It's okay, Tina.
The truth is,

834
00:37:13,728 --> 00:37:15,078
we've all experienced
unrequited love before,

835
00:37:15,113 --> 00:37:16,947
and we've all done things that we wish

836
00:37:16,998 --> 00:37:19,583
we didn't, and we all just want
to get back to being friends.

837
00:37:19,617 --> 00:37:22,169
And that's just what we are.
I mean, we're just friends.

838
00:37:22,203 --> 00:37:24,037
Um, well, we're going
to the double feature

839
00:37:24,071 --> 00:37:25,589
of <i>All About Eve</i> and <i>Showgirls</i>
at the revival house

840
00:37:25,623 --> 00:37:26,957
if you want to come with us.
Wow.

841
00:37:27,008 --> 00:37:28,592
Mystery solved, Hagatha Christie.

842
00:37:28,626 --> 00:37:30,877
I'm gonna be a third wheel
for the rest of my life.

843
00:37:30,911 --> 00:37:33,046
First of all, that's
not even remotely true.

844
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,382
Starting right now, I'm gonna
help you get a boyfriend.

845
00:37:35,416 --> 00:37:37,351
And second of all,
when I called you a hag,

846
00:37:37,385 --> 00:37:39,219
I was bringing attention to the fact

847
00:37:39,253 --> 00:37:41,521
that you are honoring the noble
and proud tradition of hagdom.

848
00:37:41,556 --> 00:37:43,273
Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, and
I, for one, am psyched

849
00:37:43,308 --> 00:37:45,525
that my very first hag was
someone as kick-ass as...

850
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,145
BLAINE AND KURT:
Ms. Tina Cohen-Chang.

851
00:37:48,196 --> 00:37:49,813
(Tina laughs)

852
00:37:49,864 --> 00:37:51,615
(school bell ringing) Hey.

853
00:37:51,649 --> 00:37:53,984
Sorry I didn't get to
see you after the party.

854
00:37:54,035 --> 00:37:56,036
I wanted to say thank you.
Uh, for what?

855
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,789
Come on. Jake is awesome
and everything, but he's not

856
00:37:58,823 --> 00:38:01,041
capable of that.
Any of it.

857
00:38:01,075 --> 00:38:05,212
I know it was you whispering
in his ear like Cyrano.

858
00:38:05,246 --> 00:38:06,330
Like who?

859
00:38:06,381 --> 00:38:07,965
Anyway, it was sweet.

860
00:38:07,999 --> 00:38:09,666
And romantic.

861
00:38:09,717 --> 00:38:11,969
And whenever you do that
for someone for real,

862
00:38:12,003 --> 00:38:14,788
she's going to be the
luckiest girl on the planet.

863
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,008
It was for real.

864
00:38:23,348 --> 00:38:24,648
I'm sorry.

865
00:38:24,682 --> 00:38:26,350
I should probably go.

866
00:38:26,401 --> 00:38:28,402
Yeah.

867
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:43,688
(school bell ringing)

868
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:49,310
Uh, that was a fresh cup.
Clearly it's not working.

869
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:51,163
You're sitting there
looking half-asleep.

870
00:38:51,197 --> 00:38:53,147
What has gotten into you, Finn?
Everything.

871
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:55,483
The whole situation... it sucks,
and it's time to fix it.

872
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:57,702
No one ever felt

873
00:38:57,753 --> 00:39:00,172
better sitting around, moping,
feeling sorry for themselves.

874
00:39:00,206 --> 00:39:03,041
That's what Glee Club, and you,
have taught me over the years.

875
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:05,994
Never shy away from a challenge,
never back down.

876
00:39:06,012 --> 00:39:08,496
And-and no matter what,
do not give up.

877
00:39:08,514 --> 00:39:10,682
I am not giving up. I...

878
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:12,834
I just need time to process.

879
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:15,887
Look, there's no time
to process, Mr. Shue.

880
00:39:15,938 --> 00:39:17,272
Somewhere out there right now

881
00:39:17,306 --> 00:39:19,107
there's a <i>Miss</i> Pillsbury running around

882
00:39:19,141 --> 00:39:20,809
who should already
be a <i>Mrs. Schuester.</i>

883
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:24,196
Emma needs her husband,

884
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:27,399
and the New Directions!
Need both of their coaches.

885
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,284
I'll be right by your side.

886
00:39:29,318 --> 00:39:31,185
I'm your best man.

887
00:39:31,204 --> 00:39:33,688
We're going to go
and win nationals again...

888
00:39:33,706 --> 00:39:34,739
together.

889
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,841
And together,
we're gonna find your wife.

890
00:39:36,876 --> 00:39:38,877
And we're gonna make things right.

891
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,881
Okay.

892
00:39:45,334 --> 00:39:47,335
Thank you.

893
00:39:49,055 --> 00:39:51,556
(school bell ringing)

894
00:39:53,893 --> 00:39:55,877
Surprised to see me?
No.

895
00:39:55,895 --> 00:39:57,896
I saw you two minutes ago. You
took forever wheeling up here.

896
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:00,098
Before I went home,
I wanted to apologize

897
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:02,317
for being so bitchy at the wedding.

898
00:40:02,351 --> 00:40:05,219
When I get nervous, I get kind of mean.

899
00:40:05,238 --> 00:40:06,905
<i>Kind of</i> mean?
You were like <i>Idi Amin</i> mean.

900
00:40:06,939 --> 00:40:08,556
I know, I'm working on that.

901
00:40:08,574 --> 00:40:10,558
Anyway, thanks for putting up with me.

902
00:40:10,576 --> 00:40:12,110
And thanks for...

903
00:40:12,161 --> 00:40:14,395
You're, like, the best I've ever had.

904
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:15,947
And I've had a lot.

905
00:40:15,998 --> 00:40:17,332
Oh, me, too.

906
00:40:17,366 --> 00:40:19,567
I mean, my sexual prowess is legendary

907
00:40:19,585 --> 00:40:20,919
throughout the Great Lake states.

908
00:40:20,953 --> 00:40:22,787
(both laugh)

909
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:25,290
Give me your digits, woman.

910
00:40:25,341 --> 00:40:27,792
Why? 'Cause this Saturday
I'm taking you out.

911
00:40:27,843 --> 00:40:31,796
Like on a date?
Yes, definitely a date.

912
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:33,414
We'll grab some dinner,
maybe see a movie...

913
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:36,101
Or we could just skip the
dinner and movie, and...

914
00:40:36,135 --> 00:40:39,304
Charter a private jet, fly to Paris,

915
00:40:39,355 --> 00:40:41,940
dance under the Arc de Triomphe
in the Champs-Elysées?

916
00:40:41,974 --> 00:40:43,942
Yo, when you're rolling
with Artie Abrams,

917
00:40:43,976 --> 00:40:45,477
