to make a reservation

25
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,100
The magical mystery tour

26
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,700
is coming to take you away

27
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,800
coming to take you away

28
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,900

is dying to take you away

30
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,800
dying to take you away

31
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,800
take you today...

32
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,000
We’re going to be late

33
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,000
I can’t go any quicker

34
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,900
Stop it!

35
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,900
Come on!

36
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,300
Richard B. Starkey and his aunt, Jessica

37
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,200
are always arguing about one thing or another

38
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,800
I'm going...

39
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,800
Go on!

40
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,100
And what with today being Sunday

41
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,400
and the weather looking up…

42
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,400
you’d think they’d have given it a rest

43
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,000
Will you stop that sitting down?

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
All right, all right.
What’s your hurry?

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,300
But no. On and on they go

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,400
Good morning, 
said Richard

47
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,900
“Good Afternoon, sir,”
said the courier

48
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,900
They were late.

49
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,600
Good Morning, ladies 
and gentlemen, boys and girls

50
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,500
Welcome to the 

51
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,700
Magical Mystery Tour!

52
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,000
I am your courier...
Jolly Jimmy Johnson!

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,900
- All my friends call me Jolly Jimmy
- And you are all my friends

54
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,300
Over here is your hostess, 
that lovely, delightful, delectable

55
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,900
Wendy Winters 

56
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,600
And over here is our driver for the trip
- that wonderful driver

57
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,900
we hope… 

58
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,500
Alf!  
Off you go, Alf

59
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,900
Fasten your seat belts please
Away, way, way we go

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,200
Get the popcorns out.

61
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,900
Right had arm. There we are.
Splendid

62
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,700
Anyway, I’ll tell you something
You ain’t coming away with me anymore

63
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,000
I bought the tickets for the trip

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah, with my money

65
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,400
I bought them. 
I’m taking you out.

66
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
I gave you the money, darling

67
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,100
You’ve done nothing but eye all 
the fellows on the coach

68
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,100
since we got here

69
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,700
Since Uncle Jack died, 
you’ve never been the same.

70
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,600
Of course I ain’t, ‘cause I ain’t got 
Uncle Jack, Have I?  

71
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,400
 I gotta get somebody else, haven’t I?

72
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,100
Do a bit of knitting, 
It’d do you good.

73
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Who for?  You?

74
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,800
Should I knit for you?

75
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,500
No, don’t knit for me

76
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,300
Who is that man?

77
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,600
Oh, that’s Mr. Bloodvessel

78
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,300
He’s quite harmless. 
He comes on all the trips

79
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,800
He thinks he’s the courier

80
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,600
Last time he thought 
he was the driver

81
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,800
You know when I saw your first film, 
I really thought you had something

82
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,200
Wasn’t it “Blue Lady”? “LADY IN BLUE”
Something like that?

83
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,100
Excuse me, sir...

84
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,400
I’d like to take a photograph 
of the young lady

85
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,200
Day after day

86
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,500
Alone on a hill

87
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,500
The man with the foolish grin
is keeping perfectly still

88
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,100
But nobody wants to know him

89
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,200
They can see that he's just a fool

90
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,700
And he never gives an answer

91
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,800
But the fool on the hill

92
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,300
Sees the sun going down

93
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,500
And the eyes in his head

94
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,900
See the world spinning 'round

95
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,300
Well on his way

96
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,900
Head in a cloud

97
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,000
The man with a thousand voices

98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,300
talking perfectly loud

99
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,700
But nobody ever hear him

100
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,100
or the sound he appears to make

101
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,300
and he never seems to notice

102
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,300
But the fool on the hill

103
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,700
Sees the sun going down

104
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,000
And the eyes in his head

105
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,500
See the world spinning 'round

106
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,300
And nobody seems to like him

107
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,400
they can tell what he wants to do

108
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,700
and he never shows his feeling

109
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,700
But the fool on the hill

110
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,100
Sees the sun going down

111
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,200
And the eyes in his head

112
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,000
See the world spinning 'round

113
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,000
And he never listens to them

114
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,200
He knows that they're the fools

115
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,700
They don't like him

116
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,200
The fool on the hill

117
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,400
Sees the sun going down

118
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,500
And the eyes in his head

119
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,100
See the world spinning 'round

120
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,700
Good morning,
lads and lasses

121
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,700
My name is Miss Winters

122
00:08:54,900 --> 00:09:00,000
Good morning, Miss Winters
Miss Winters, Miss Winters

123
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,500
If there’s anything 
I can do for you… 

124
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,900
you know what to do...

125
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,800
We at the Magical Mysteries

126
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,300
only have your best interest at heart

127
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,400
thank you...

128
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,500
As the bus leaves the town

129
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,500
behind and heads for the country… 

130
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,200
Everything begins to change

131
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,200
Well, almost everything

132
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,900
Already the magic is beginning to work

133
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,400
Jolly good...

134
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
Why?

135
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,900
Why?

136
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:36,900
Why?

137
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,400
Jolly good, Sarge, carry on...

138
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,100
On your marks!

139
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,500
If you look to your left,
ladies and gentlemen

140
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,500
the view is not very inspiring

141
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,600
But if you look to the right… 

142
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,200
Beyond the blue horizon

143
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,100
for above the clouds… 

144
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,500
in a land that no one knows… 

145
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,800
Live four or five magicians… 

146
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,400
Who spend their days
casting wonderful spells

147
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,500
Come with me now
into that secret place… 

148
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,400
Where the eyes of man
have never set foot

149
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,900
Where’s the bus?

150
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,800
Where’s the bus?

151
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,000
Where’s the bus?

152
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,300
It’s coming

153
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,900
Where’s the bus?

154
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,300
The bus...

155
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,400
The bus is ten miles north 
on the Jewsbury Road

156
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,400
It’s only ten miles away.

157
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
ten miles!...

158
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,300
Ladies and gentlemen, 
quickly, look to your left

159
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,200
Now there you see 
the ancient Roman ruins

160
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,000
They really have been 
there an awful long time

161
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,300
They are, in fact, 
a little difficult to see

162
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,800
because they’re almost 
flattened to the ground

163
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,100
Meanwhile, back on the bus, 
things are happening

164
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,600
Indeed, the magic 
is so powerful

165
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,800
that even Mr. Bloodvessel 
emerges from his shell

166
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,300
He turns to speak

167
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,300
If I may the liberty, Mister

168
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,300
Be my guest

169
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,800
My dear lady...

170
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,700
My dear lady, doesn’t intuition 
tell you what I feel?

171
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,300
Don’t interrupt...

172
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,900
You bring out my… 

173
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,200
I...

174
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,600
I love you!!

175
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,600
I am the courier

176
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,900
good morning... men... 
and... women...

177
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,100
welcome...

178
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,200
I am your friendly courier

179
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,000
Mr Bllodvessel is my name

180
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,400
Buster Bloodvessel

181
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,900
I am concerned for you 

182
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,600
to enjoy yourselves…

183
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,500
Within the limits 
of British decency

184
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,800
You know what I mean

185
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:00,900
don’t you? 

186
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,100
Well, don’t you?

187
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,800
Yes, Mr. Bloodvessel

188
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:32,200
I am he as you are he 
as you are me

189
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,000
and we are all together

190
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,300
See how they run 
like pigs from a gun

191
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,200
see how they fly

192
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,200
I'm crying

193
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,500
Sitting on a cornflake

194
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,900
waiting for the van to come

195
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,800
Corporation t-shirts, 
stupid bloody Tuesday

196
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,300
Man, you've been a naughty boy, 
you let your face grow long

197
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,500
I am the eggman

198
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,300
they are the eggmen

199
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,400
I am the walrus

200
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,800
Mister City P'liceman sitting

201
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:18,000
Pretty little policemen in a row

202
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,000
See how they fly 
like Lucy in the Sky

203
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
see how they run

204
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,800
I'm crying

205
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,400
I'm cry

206
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,500
Yellow matter custard

207
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,000
dripping from a dead dog's eye

208
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,600
Crabalocker fishwife,
pornographic priestess

209
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,900
Boy, you been a naughty girl 
and you let your knickers down

I am the walrus

213
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,300
Sitting in an English garden

214
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,100
waiting for the sun

215
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,500
If the sun don't come, 
you get a tan from

216
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,500
Standing in the English rain

217
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,600
I am the eggman

218
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,600
they are the eggmen

219
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,400
I am the walrus

220

Expert texpert 
choking smokers

221
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,200
Don't you think 
the joker laughs at you?

222
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,500
See how they smile 
like pigs in a sty

223
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,600
see how they snide

224
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,200
I'm crying

00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,400
Semolina Pilchard 

226
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,700
climbing up the Eiffel Tower

00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,200
Elementary penguin

228
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,600
Man, you should have seen them 
kicking Edgar Allan Poe

231
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,500
I am the walrus

232
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,800
I’ve got a present for you,
do you know what it is? 

233
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,500
no 

234
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,500
Have a guess

235
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400

236
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,400
Come on, have a guess

Have a guess

240
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,600
Have a guess!

241
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,900
no!

242
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,900
Well, you’re going to get it anyway

243
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,700
What's that?

244
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,600
Do you want to blow it?

245
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,600
no 

246
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,600
All right, 
should we give it to George?

247
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,600
yes

248
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,800
Thank you

249
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,400
Ladies and gentlemen, 
may I have your attention please? 

250
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:00,700
Our estimated time of arrival for luncheon 
is approximately one fifteen

251
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,700
thank you

252
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,700
Now, shut up

253
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,300
Shut up to me! 

254
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,600
I’ve had enough of it! 

255
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,300
I can’t stand it any more! 
I’m getting off!

256
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:11,800
Don’t get hysterical

257
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,100
Aunt Jessie’s hungry

258
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,900
And she’s dreaming

259
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,000
She’s dreaming about food

260
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,700
food

261
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,000
food

262
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,300
Beautiful food

263
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,500
lettuces...

264
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,100
potatoes...

265
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,000
apples...

266
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,700
food

267
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,200
oh lovely food

268
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,300
Lots and lots of spaghetti

269
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,100
This time I mean it

270
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,900
I can’t breathe anymore

271
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,900
It’s too much

272
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,600
All this mud

273
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,700
in forty-five minutes?  

274
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,300
I can hardly get my breath

275
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,400
It’s intake, Jessie

276
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,900
not output

277
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,300
I am, I am! 
I am already

278
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,200
Three times this week already

279
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,800
For goodness sake

280
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,200
Jessie, sit down

281
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,300
remember...

282
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,700
 I don’t care! 

283
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,800
This is the way 
he would have wanted it

284
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,600
Penendello, 
help me up the stairs

285
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,500
Wake up, Jessie

286
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,100
It’s time to go

287
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:06,900
Here we are again!

288
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,800
Everybody up quickly

289
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:21,000
There's a fog upon L.A.

290
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:27,800
And my friends 
have lost their way

291
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,800
We'll be over soon they said

292
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,300
Now they've lost 
themselves instead

293
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,700
Please don't be long

294
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:53,400
please don't you be very long

295
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,000
Please don't be long

296
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,100
or I may be asleep

297
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,900
Well it only goes to show

298
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,100
Ask a policeman on the street

299
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,700
Ask a policeman on the street

300
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,200
There's so many there to meet

301
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:31,100
Please don't be long

302
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,600
please don't you be very long

303
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,500
Please don't be long

304
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,400
or I may be asleep

305
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,600
Now it's past my bed I know

306
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,000
And I'd really like to go

307
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,600
Soon will be the break of day

308
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:05,200
Sitting here in Blue Jay Way

309
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:13,300
Please don't be long

310
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,500
please don't you be very long

311
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,100
Please don't be long

312
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:25,000
or I may be asleep

313
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,900
Please don't be long

314
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:35,000
please don't you be very long

315
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,800
Please don't be long

316
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,200
Well, well, well

317
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,800
They are a happy crowd

318
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,400
Come on, come on

319
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,700
Back on the bus... 
come on

320
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,400
Oh! I wonder what the magicians 
are cooking up now?

321
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,800
Talk about your magical mysteries…

322
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,800
I spent half an hour 
looking for that sugar

323
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,700
I spent half an hour 
looking for that sugar

324
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,700
Is there one for me?

325
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,900
There’s one over here, Richie

326
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,100
Oh, how are you, Bonzo?  

327
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,100
Any news of the bus?

328
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,300
The bus is ten miles north 
on the Jewsbury Road

329
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,100
And they’re having a lovely time

330
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,300
they’re having a lovely time

331
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,400
they’re having a lovely time

332
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,700
Could you tell me 
what’s next on the agenda?

333
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,700
A Song

334
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,000
No, no

335
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,300
not you

336
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,300
 Them!

337
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,300
On the bus!

338
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,200
Join in.  
What’s the matter with you?

339
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,500
Ladies and gentlemen,

340
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,200
when the coach stops,

341
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,400
would the gentlemen 
please follow Mr. Johnson? 

342
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,500
The ladies stay with me

343
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:36,500
That night Cutie called a cab

344
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,800
baby don't do that

345
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:44,300
She left her East Side room so drab

346
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,300
baby don't do that

347
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,100
She went out on the town

348
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:55,400
Knowin' it would 
make her lover frown

349
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,400
Death-cab for Cutie

350
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,100
Death-cab for Cutie

351
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,500
Someone's gonna make

352
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,600
you pay your fare

353
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:14,100
The cab was racin' through the night

354
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,900
baby don't do that

355
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,700
His eyes in the mirror, 
keepin' Cutie in sight

356
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,400
baby don't do that

357
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:29,200
When he saw Cutie, 
it gave him a thrill

358
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:34,200
Don't you know, 
baby curves can kill

359
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,400

Cutie, don't you play with fate

363
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,400
Don't leave your lover alone

364
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,200
If you go out on this date

365
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,700
His heart will turn to stone

366
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:08,000
Bad girl, Cutie, 
what have you done

367
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,900
baby don't do that

368
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:15,800
Slippin' slidin' down-a Highway 31

369
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,500
baby don't do that

from green to red

00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:28,600
They tried to stop 
but they both wound up dead

372
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,700
