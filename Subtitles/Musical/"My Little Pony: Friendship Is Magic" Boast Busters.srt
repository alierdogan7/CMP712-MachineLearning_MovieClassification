1
00:00:00,058 --> 00:00:03,506
Spike: Come on Twilight, you can do it!

2
00:00:03,506 --> 00:00:05,271
Twilight: Okay, here goes.

3
00:00:07,825 --> 00:00:09,404
(poof)

4
00:00:10,194 --> 00:00:11,773
Spike: Ha-HA! You did it!

5
00:00:10,194 --> 00:00:11,773
Spike: Ha-HA! You did it!

6
00:00:11,773 --> 00:00:14,698
Growing magic. That's number 25!

7
00:00:14,698 --> 00:00:17,206
Twenty-five different types of tricks and counting.

8
00:00:17,206 --> 00:00:20,503
(pleased) And I think this is the best trick so far.

9
00:00:20,503 --> 00:00:26,540
(suave) Hello, Rarity. What's that? Aw, it's nothin', just my AWESOME moustache!

10
00:00:26,054 --> 00:00:27,748
(chuckles)

11
00:00:27,748 --> 00:00:33,088
Twilight: Sorry, Romeo. As attractive and enticing as you look, 
 it's just for practice and it's gotta go.

12
00:00:33,088 --> 00:00:37,314
Spike: Wait! (poof, crestfallen) Aw, rats...

13
00:00:37,314 --> 00:00:38,754
(Twilight giggles)

14
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:45,767
(theme song begins) My Little Pony, My Little Pony, ah, ah, ah, ah,

15
00:00:45,767 --> 00:00:50,132
(My Little Pony) Twilight: I used to wonder what friendship could be

16
00:00:50,132 --> 00:00:54,079
(My Little Pony) Until you all shared its magic with me

17
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,401
Rainbow Dash: Big adventure
Pinkie Pie: Tons of fun

18
00:00:56,401 --> 00:00:58,630
Rarity: A beautiful heart
Applejack: Faithful and strong

19
00:00:58,063 --> 00:01:00,488
Fluttershy: Sharing kindness
Twilight: It's an easy feat

20
00:01:00,488 --> 00:01:02,810
All: And magic makes it all complete, yeah

21
00:01:02,081 --> 00:01:11,308
(My Little Pony) Do you know, you're all my very best friends

22
00:01:14,722 --> 00:01:16,765
Spike: Twenty-five, Twilight!

23
00:01:16,765 --> 00:01:19,459
Twenty-five different kinds of tricks and counting.

24
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:24,196
I thought unicorns were only supposed to have a 
 little magic that matches their special talent.

25
00:01:24,196 --> 00:01:28,793
Twilight: True, for ponies whose talents are for 
 things like cooking or singing or math,

26
00:01:28,793 --> 00:01:31,719
but what if a unicorn's special talent IS magic?

27
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:34,923
Spike: Like you, Twilight! And you know a TON of magic.

28
00:01:34,923 --> 00:01:36,595
Twilight: (embarrassed) Oh, Spike, stop.

29
00:01:36,595 --> 00:01:39,289
I'm sure there are lots of ponies right here in Ponyville

30
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:40,087
that know just as much magic as me...

31
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:41,089
Spike: Are you kiddin'?!

32
00:01:41,889 --> 00:01:45,084
I don't think there's another unicorn in all of 
 Equestria with your kind of ability, Twilight.

33
00:01:45,837 --> 00:01:48,086
Snails: (heavy Canadian accent) Gaaaangway! Comin' through!

34
00:01:48,855 --> 00:01:50,011
(Spike grunts)

35
00:01:50,481 --> 00:01:53,068
Spike: Snips...Snails...w-what's going on?!

36
00:01:53,685 --> 00:01:56,008
Snails: Why, haven't you heard?
(Spike yelps, crashes)

37
00:01:56,077 --> 00:01:58,035
There's a new unicorn in town!

38
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:03,069
Snips: (hyperventilating) Yeah! They say she's got more 
 magical powers than any other unicorn EVER!

39
00:02:03,693 --> 00:02:04,071
Twilight: Really?

40
00:02:04,714 --> 00:02:08,001
Spike: Aw, no way. That honor goes to Twilight here!

41
00:02:08,871 --> 00:02:10,073
Twilight: Where is this unicorn?

44
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:20,043
Trixie: (amplified) Come one! Come all!

45
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:27,022
(trilling r's) Come and witness the amazing magic of the Grrreat and Powerrrful Trrrrixie!

46
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:32,004
(ponies ooh and ahh)

47
00:02:32,091 --> 00:02:35,076
(theatrical) Watch in awe as the Great and Powerful Trixie

48
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:40,091
performs the most spectacular feats of pony magic ever witnessed by pony eyes!

49
00:02:40,914 --> 00:02:43,056
(pyrotechnics burst, fanfare plays)

50
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:47,018
Rarity: (unimpressed) My, my, my! What boasting!

51
00:02:47,184 --> 00:02:53,078
Spike: Come on, no pony's as magical as 
 Twili- (flustered) Twi- Twi- O-oh! (clears throat)

52
00:02:53,778 --> 00:02:56,052
(bashful) Hey, Rarity, I, uh... MOUSTACHE!

53
00:02:57,004 --> 00:03:00,023
Twilight: There's nothing wrong with being talented, is there?

54
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:05,097
Applejack: Nothin' at all, 'ceptin' when someone goes around showin' it 
 off like a school filly with fancy new ribbons.

55
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:10,094
Rarity: Just because one has the ability to perform lots of magic 
 does not make one better than the rest of us.

56
00:03:10,938 --> 00:03:15,026
Rainbow Dash: Especially when ya got me around bein' 
 better than the rest of us. (chuckles)

57
00:03:15,257 --> 00:03:20,013
Uh, I mean, (unconvincing) yeah, uh, magic-shmagic! Boo!

58
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:26,000
Trixie: Well, well, well. It looks like we have 
 some (neighing) neigh [nay] sayers in the audience!

59
00:03:25,995 --> 00:03:32,076
Who is so IGNORANT as to challenge the magical 
 ability of the Great and Powerful Trixie?!

60
00:03:32,764 --> 00:03:38,052
Do they not know that they're in the presence of 
 the most magical unicorn in all of Equestria?!

61
00:03:38,523 --> 00:03:41,068
Rarity: (raspberry) Just WHO does she think she is?

62
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:45,044
Spike: Yeah! Since we all know that Twilight here is-
Twilight: (whispering) Spike! Shh!

63
00:03:45,443 --> 00:03:46,074
Spike: What? What's wrong?

64
00:03:46,743 --> 00:03:49,044
Twilight: Did you see how they reacted to Trixie?

65
00:03:49,436 --> 00:03:51,066
I don't want anyone thinking I'M a showoff!

66
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:55,015
(drumroll, fanfare, pyrotechnics)

67
00:03:55,086 --> 00:03:58,068
Rainbow Dash: So, "Great and Powerful Trixie,"

68
00:03:58,678 --> 00:04:01,005
what makes you think you're so awesome, anyway?

69
00:04:01,046 --> 00:04:08,069
Trixie: (self-amused chuckle) Why, only the Great and Powerful Trixie 
 has magic strong enough to VANQUISH! THE DREADED!

70
00:04:08,686 --> 00:04:10,031
URSA MAJOR!

71
00:04:10,311 --> 00:04:14,007
(fanfare, pyrotechnics)

72
00:04:15,048 --> 00:04:17,097
(audience ahhs)
Snips: What?! Snails: No way!

73
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:23,013
Trixie: When all hope was lost, the ponies of 
 Hoofington [Huffington] had no one to turn to,

74
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,017
(robotic growling)
but the Great and Powerful Trixie stepped in,

75
00:04:26,017 --> 00:04:28,026
(mechanical growling)
and with her awesome magic

76
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:31,098
(static fizzle)
vanquished the Ursa Major and sent it back to its cave

77
00:04:31,975 --> 00:04:34,048
deep within the Everfree Forest!

78
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,076
Snips: Aw, sweet!
Snails: Sa-weet!

79
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,052
Snips: That settles it.

80
00:04:38,872 --> 00:04:45,014
Snails: Trixie really is the most talented, most magical, most awesome unicorn in Ponyville.

81
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:48,067
Snips: No! In all of Equestria!

82
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:50,062
Spike: How d'you know?! You didn't see it!

83
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:53,004
And besides, Twi- (zip) Mmf! Mmf!

84
00:04:53,036 --> 00:04:54,073
(haughty chuckle)

85
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:58,035
(stroking ego) It's true, my enthusiastic little admirer.

86
00:04:58,353 --> 00:05:02,012
Trixie is most certainly the best in Ponyville!

87
00:05:02,115 --> 00:05:04,051
(crickets chirping)

88
00:05:04,506 --> 00:05:09,096
Well then, I hereby challenge you, (derisively) Ponyvillians:

89
00:05:09,963 --> 00:05:13,049
(boastful) Anything you can do, I can do better.

90
00:05:13,493 --> 00:05:15,063
Any takers? Anyone?

91
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:23,062
Or is Trixie destined to be the greatest equine that has EVER LIVED?!
(fanfare, pyrotechnics)

92
00:05:23,617 --> 00:05:27,094
Spike: (unzips mouth, pleads) Ple-e-ease! She's unbearable!

93
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:31,037
You gotta show her! You just gotta! (sobs)

94
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:34,095
Twilight: (whispering) There's no way I'm gonna use my magic now, Spike! Especially since-

95
00:05:34,948 --> 00:05:38,015
Trixie: Hmm...how about...YOU!

96
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:39,080
(Twilight gulps nervously)

97
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,021
Trixie: Well, how about it? Hmm?

98
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:48,086
(condescending) Is there anything YOU can do that the Great and Powerful Trixie can't?!

99
00:05:48,857 --> 00:05:50,095
Twilight: (meekly) I...I...

100
00:05:50,946 --> 00:05:53,008
(banjo strumming)
Trixie: Well, little hayseed?

101
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,087
Applejack: That's it! I can't stand for no more o'this!

102
00:05:55,869 --> 00:05:57,014
Spike: You show her, AJ!

103
00:05:57,136 --> 00:06:00,005
Applejack: Can your magical powers do...THIS?!

104
00:06:00,049 --> 00:06:03,095
(spirited country music, rope twirling)

105
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:06,064
(ponies ooh)
(spirited country music, rope twirling)

106
00:06:06,643 --> 00:06:10,068
(spirited country music)

107
00:06:10,683 --> 00:06:12,010
(chomps, gulps, music ends)

108
00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:15,005
(ponies cheer raucously)

109
00:06:15,049 --> 00:06:16,063
Applejack: Top THAT, missy.

110
00:06:16,628 --> 00:06:19,014
Trixie: (unfazed) Oh ye of little talent.

111
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:22,099
Watch and be amazed at the magic of Trixie!

112
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:35,006
(Arabian music)

113
00:06:35,064 --> 00:06:36,064
Applejack: Whoa! (grunts, crashes into ground)
(Arabian music)

114
00:06:38,036 --> 00:06:40,061
(ponies cheer)

115
00:06:40,614 --> 00:06:44,033
Trixie: Once again, the Great and Powerful Trixie prevails.

116
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:47,067
Rainbow Dash: There's no need to go struttin' around and showin' off like that!

117
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:50,083
Trixie: Oh?
Rainbow Dash: That's MY job!

118
00:06:50,831 --> 00:06:53,025
(rock music)

119
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,029
(windmill grinds)
(rock music)

120
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,080
(repeated thumps)
(rock music)

121
00:06:57,797 --> 00:06:59,063
(rock music)

122
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:01,063
(rising pitch whoosh)
(rock music)

123
00:07:01,628 --> 00:07:03,081
(whoosh, whoosh, whoosh)
(rock music)

124
00:07:03,811 --> 00:07:06,069
(rising pitch whoosh)
(rock music)

125
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:08,096
(windmill grinds)
(rock music)

126
00:07:08,965 --> 00:07:11,040
(whoosh, brakes squeal)
(rock music)

127
00:07:11,404 --> 00:07:13,073
(rock music ends)

128
00:07:13,726 --> 00:07:18,042
They don't call me "Rainbow" and "Dash" for nothin'!

129
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:21,094
(ponies cheer)

130
00:07:21,945 --> 00:07:26,045
Trixie: When Trixie is through, the only thing they'll call you is loser.

131
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,082
(magical humming)

132
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:35,032
(Rainbow Dash screaming)
(sped up calliope music)

133
00:07:35,032 --> 00:07:37,004
(sped up calliope music)

134
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:41,036
Rainbow Dash: (weakly) I think I'm gonna be...sick...

135
00:07:41,357 --> 00:07:44,042
Trixie: Seems like any pony with a [Rainbow] "dash" of good sense

136
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:47,056
would think twice before tussling with the Great Trixie!

137
00:07:47,557 --> 00:07:49,004
(thunder, Rainbow Dash shrieks)

138
00:07:49,043 --> 00:07:51,085
(ponies laugh, Trixie laughs haughtily)

139
00:07:51,853 --> 00:07:54,092
Spike: What we need is another unicorn to challenge her!

140
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:57,040
(hinting) Someone with some magic of her own?

141
00:07:57,402 --> 00:08:01,016
Rainbow Dash: Yeah! A unicorn to show THIS unicorn who's boss!

142
00:08:01,164 --> 00:08:03,095
Applejack: A real unicorn-to-unicorn tussle!

143
00:08:03,095 --> 00:08:05,062
Twilight: Uh...

144
00:08:05,622 --> 00:08:08,055
Rarity: Enough. Enough, all of you. I take your hint,

145
00:08:08,548 --> 00:08:10,022
but Rarity is above such nonsense.

146
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:13,005
Rainbow Dash and Applejack may behave like ruffians,

147
00:08:13,053 --> 00:08:15,070
but Rarity conducts herself with beauty and grace.

148
00:08:15,007 --> 00:08:17,079
Trixie: (mocking) Ooh, what's the matter?

149
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:21,078
(provoking) Afraid you'll get a hair out of place 
 in that rat's nest you call a mane?

150
00:08:21,783 --> 00:08:24,085
Rarity: Oh. It. Is. ON.

151
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:27,096
You may think you're tough with all of your so-called "powers,"

152
00:08:27,096 --> 00:08:30,070
but there's more to magic than your brutish ways.

153
00:08:30,007 --> 00:08:33,072
A unicorn needs to be more than just muscle.

154
00:08:33,672 --> 00:08:36,046
A unicorn needs to have style.
(classical music)

155
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,006
(classical music)

156
00:08:38,006 --> 00:08:41,054
A unicorn is not a unicorn without grace and beauty.
(classical music, audience oohs)

157
00:08:41,543 --> 00:08:43,086
(magical humming)
(classical music)

158
00:08:43,726 --> 00:08:46,000
Spike: Rarity won't let Trixie get the best of her!
(classical music)

159
00:08:46,002 --> 00:08:49,031
She's strong, she's beautiful, she's- (poof)
(classical music)

160
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:53,052
(ponies gasp and recoil)

161
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:56,045
Rarity: (panicked) QUICK! I NEED A MIRROR! GET ME A MIRROR!

162
00:08:56,451 --> 00:08:59,066
(squealing) What did she do to my hair?! I 
 know she did something terrible to my hair!

163
00:08:59,655 --> 00:09:01,079
Twilight: (nervously) N-nothing!
Rainbow Dash: (hastily) It's fine!

164
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,023
Applejack: (dazed) It's gorgeous!

165
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,021
Spike: (tactless) It's green.

166
00:09:04,206 --> 00:09:05,065
What?

167
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:09,013
Rarity: (tearing up) No! Green hair!

168
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:14,079
Not green hair! (sobs theatrically) That's an awful, AWFUL color! (sobs)

169
00:09:14,794 --> 00:09:16,074
Pony: Well, I never!
[supposed to be a green-haired female Carrot Top]

170
00:09:16,745 --> 00:09:19,034
Spike: Well, Twilight, I guess it's up to you.

171
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:22,018
Come on, show her what you're made of!

172
00:09:22,178 --> 00:09:24,092
Twilight: (deflecting) What do you mean? I-I'm nothing special...

173
00:09:24,918 --> 00:09:27,024
Spike: Yes you ARE! You're better than her!

174
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,077
Twilight: I'm not better than anyone!

175
00:09:28,773 --> 00:09:32,081
Trixie: Hah! You think you're better than the Great and Powerful Trixie?

176
00:09:32,813 --> 00:09:35,032
You think you have MORE magical talent?

177
00:09:35,321 --> 00:09:39,027
(provoking) Well, come on. Show Trixie what you've got. Show us all.

178
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:43,073
Twilight: Who, me? I'm just your run-of-the-mill citizen of Ponyville!

179
00:09:43,726 --> 00:09:45,044
No powerful magic here.

180
00:09:45,445 --> 00:09:49,044
I, uh, think I hear my laundry calling. Sorry!

181
00:09:51,343 --> 00:09:52,036
Spike: Twilight?

182
00:09:52,364 --> 00:09:56,026
Trixie: Ha! Once again, the Great and Powerful Trixie

183
00:09:56,265 --> 00:10:00,068
has proven herself to be the most amazing unicorn in all of Equestria!

184
00:10:00,677 --> 00:10:03,093
(under breath) Was there ever any doubt?

185
00:10:09,593 --> 00:10:14,070
Snips: Here's the smoothie you asked for! With 
 extra hay! Just how you like it.

186
00:10:14,702 --> 00:10:18,018
Snails: (slow, dull speech) Mm, hay.

187
00:10:19,671 --> 00:10:22,027
(slurping)

188
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:23,029
Trixie: (annoyed) Yes?

189
00:10:23,293 --> 00:10:27,043
Snips: Oh! Tell us another story, Great and Powerful Trixie!

190
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:32,012
Snails: Yeah, tell us about how you vanquished the Ursa Major!

191
00:10:32,117 --> 00:10:38,042
Trixie: (derisively) Hmph! TRIXIE is far too exhausted from performing feats beyond imagination.

192
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:41,010
BEGONE with you until morning.

193
00:10:41,103 --> 00:10:45,065
Snails: Oh, of course, Great and Powerful Trixie!

194
00:10:45,654 --> 00:10:48,077
Snips: Anything you say! We are at your beck and call!

195
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:50,016
(sighs haughtily)

196
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:52,036
Spike: What're YOU two doin'?

197
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:55,066
Snips: Just bringin' the G. and P. T. a-
Spike: ...The what?

198
00:10:55,662 --> 00:10:57,094
Snips: The Great and Powerful Trixie!

199
00:10:57,937 --> 00:11:01,014
Spike: Sheesh.
Snips: Just bringin' her a smoothie!

200
00:11:01,142 --> 00:11:03,042
Spike: How can you fall for her lameness?!

201
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:04,076
She's just a showoff.

202
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:09,069
Spike: Unlike Twilight, who-
Snips: The Great and Powerful Trixie vanquished an Ursa Major.

203
00:11:09,687 --> 00:11:11,059
Can your "Twilight" claim that?

204
00:11:11,591 --> 00:11:14,075
Spike: Oh, really? Were you guys actually there?

205
00:11:14,749 --> 00:11:17,077
Snips: Well, eh...uh...no, but-

206
00:11:17,767 --> 00:11:20,000
Spike: But nothin'. The proof is in the pudding!

207
00:11:19,996 --> 00:11:23,053
Snails: (slow-witted laughter) I like pudding.

208
00:11:24,826 --> 00:11:29,010
Spike: ...Look, unless an Ursa Major comes waltzing 
 up the street for Trixie to vanquish,

209
00:11:29,099 --> 00:11:31,024
I am NOT gonna believe a word she says!

210
00:11:31,235 --> 00:11:32,054
And neither should you!

211
00:11:32,535 --> 00:11:36,011
Snips: Hmm! An Ursa walkin' up the street, eh?

212
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:38,080
(a la Brain [Pinky and the Brain]) Snails, you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

213
00:11:38,805 --> 00:11:43,082
Snails: (a la Pinky) Why is it they call it 
 a flea market when they don't really sell fleas?

214
00:11:43,082 --> 00:11:46,047
Snips: Yeah! Uh... (doubletakes) Oh, uh...come on!

215
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,087
Spike: Twilight, would you put down that book and just listen to me?

216
00:11:54,873 --> 00:11:57,080
Twilight: Didn't you see how they hated Trixie's bragging, Spike?

217
00:11:57,798 --> 00:12:01,054
If I go out there and show off my magic, 
 I run the risk of losing them as friends.

218
00:12:01,537 --> 00:12:03,039
Spike: It's not the same thing, Twilight!

219
00:12:03,386 --> 00:12:06,027
You'd be using your magic to stand up for your friends!

220
00:12:06,274 --> 00:12:08,050
Twilight: No, Spike! It's exactly the same!

221
00:12:08,503 --> 00:12:12,078
Spike: Come on, Twilight. Any one of these tricks, even 
 the teeniest, would be enough to show up Trixie.

222
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:15,052
Twilight: I don't wanna be seen as a bragger like Trixie!

223
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:16,082
(door slams shut)

224
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:19,042
Spike: (opens door) But you're the BEST!

225
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,097
Twilight: (exasperated sigh) Please, Spike! I said, "No!"

226
00:12:21,097 --> 00:12:25,092
Spike: (sighs) If that's the way you wanna be, fine. (slams door)

227
00:12:27,543 --> 00:12:29,008
(door opens)

228
00:12:34,037 --> 00:12:38,032
(spooky theremin music)

229
00:12:38,317 --> 00:12:41,080
(owl hoots)
(spooky theremin music)

230
00:12:41,008 --> 00:12:44,029
(spooky theremin music)

231
00:12:44,293 --> 00:12:50,014
Snips: (apprehensively) Oh, how we gonna find an Ursa Major when I 
 can't even see my own hoof in front of my face?!

232
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,076
Snails: Hold on!

233
00:12:51,762 --> 00:12:57,098
(grunts fiercely)

234
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,033
Snips: Oh! Heh, that's better.

235
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,033
Snips: Oh! Heh, that's better.

236
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,033
Snips: Oh! Heh, that's better.

237
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,033
Snips: Oh! Heh, that's better.

238
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,033
Snips: Oh! Heh, that's better.

239
00:12:59,331 --> 00:13:01,065
(low growl)

240
00:13:01,653 --> 00:13:07,018
(growling)

241
00:13:07,505 --> 00:13:08,029
(Snails screams)

242
00:13:08,294 --> 00:13:08,076
(Snails and Snips scream)

243
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:11,045
(Snails and Snips scream, Ursa roars)

244
00:13:11,661 --> 00:13:17,065
(Spike kicking rock)
(melancholy harp music)

245
00:13:17,652 --> 00:13:19,009
(Snips screaming)
Spike: Hey, guys.

246
00:13:19,092 --> 00:13:19,097
(Snails panting)
Where ya goin'?

247
00:13:19,974 --> 00:13:23,076
Snips: Can't talk now!
Snails: Got a "MAJOR" problem!

248
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:25,062
Snips: Yeah! URSA Major, to be exact!

249
00:13:25,616 --> 00:13:28,008
(roar)

250
00:13:28,728 --> 00:13:29,052
Spike: ...Huh?

251
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,005
(paw impacts ground)

252
00:13:31,005 --> 00:13:33,070
(roar)

253
00:13:33,697 --> 00:13:36,011
Snips and Snails: TRIXIIIIE!

254
00:13:36,112 --> 00:13:37,027
Spike: Twilight!

255
00:13:37,273 --> 00:13:40,036
(loud thuds, trees falling)

256
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:45,010
(Snips and Snails banging on door and clamoring for Trixie)

257
00:13:45,098 --> 00:13:49,065
Trixie: (annoyed) Trixie thought she said the Great and 
 Powerful Trixie did not want to be disturbed!

258
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:53,032
Snips: (nervous laughter) We-We have a...a tiny problem...

259
00:13:53,318 --> 00:13:55,092
Snails: (flatly) Actually, it's a big one.

260
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,073
Trixie: WHAT is so important that you cannot wait until morning to disturb Trixie?!

261
00:13:59,726 --> 00:14:02,023
(distant roar, thud)

262
00:14:02,606 --> 00:14:05,062
(repeated thuds)

263
00:14:05,624 --> 00:14:07,030
(fierce roar)

264
00:14:07,296 --> 00:14:09,011
(Trixie screams)

265
00:14:10,292 --> 00:14:11,068
(Snips and Snails scream)

266
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:12,080
(Ursa snarls, crushes cart)

267
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,047
(roar)

268
00:14:15,632 --> 00:14:17,074
Spike: (frantic) Twilight! You've gotta come! Quick!

269
00:14:17,745 --> 00:14:20,058
Twilight: I've already told you, Spike! I don't wanna show up Trixie!

270
00:14:20,578 --> 00:14:24,029
Spike: No! You don't understand! It's-
(roar, thud)

271
00:14:24,293 --> 00:14:28,029
Twilight: (nervously) ...Uh, is that what I think it is?
Spike: [Ursa] Majorly...

272
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:32,016
Snips: Great and Powerful Trixie! You've got to vanquish the Ursa!

273
00:14:32,165 --> 00:14:35,009
Snails: (oblivious) Yeah! Vanquish so we can watch!

274
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:37,097
Snips: It took a LOT of trouble to get that thing here!

275
00:14:37,097 --> 00:14:41,013
Trixie: Wait! YOU brought this here?! (gasps)

276
00:14:41,128 --> 00:14:43,012
Are you out of your little pony MINDS?!

277
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,059
Snips: But...you're the Great and Powerful Trixie!

278
00:14:45,586 --> 00:14:49,021
Snails: Yeah, remember? You defeated an Ursa Major!

279
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:53,071
(Ursa roars)
Trixie: (nervously) U-uh, okay...

280
00:14:53,713 --> 00:14:55,048
(gulps) Stand back...

281
00:14:56,871 --> 00:15:02,095
(Arabian music)

282
00:15:02,954 --> 00:15:04,007
(uncertain) Heh! Piece o'cake!

283
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,058
(snap)

284
00:15:06,577 --> 00:15:09,032
Snips: Aw, c'mon, Trixie!

285
00:15:09,317 --> 00:15:12,020
Snails: (very Canadian) Stop goofin' around and vanquish it, eh?

286
00:15:12,196 --> 00:15:14,024
(Trixie gasps, gulps)

287
00:15:13,984 --> 00:15:18,040
(ominous music)

288
00:15:18,396 --> 00:15:20,030
(thunder)

289
00:15:22,018 --> 00:15:23,097
Snails: (flatly) Well. That was a dud.

290
00:15:23,968 --> 00:15:29,096
Snips: Yeah, c'mon! Where's all the cool explosions and 
 smoke and stuff like earlier?! You know!

291
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:31,017
(Ursa winces)

292
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:32,084
(Ursa growls)
Trixie: (meekly) Uh-oh.

293
00:15:32,838 --> 00:15:35,021
(roar)

294
00:15:35,207 --> 00:15:37,002
(ponies screaming)

295
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:39,080
(Ursa roars)

296
00:15:39,804 --> 00:15:42,087
(Ursa roars, ponies gasp fearfully)

297
00:15:42,869 --> 00:15:45,052
(roar, crash)

298
00:15:45,517 --> 00:15:48,002
(ponies panicking)

299
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:53,052
Twilight: What's going on?!

300
00:15:53,521 --> 00:15:56,001
Snips: (proudly) We brought an Ursa to town!

301
00:15:56,012 --> 00:15:57,073
Twilight: You WHAT?!

302
00:15:57,073 --> 00:16:01,031
Snails: Don't worry! The Great and Powerful Trixie'll vanquish it!

303
00:16:02,142 --> 00:16:03,035
Trixie: (defeated) I can't.

304
00:16:03,349 --> 00:16:05,021
Snips and Snails: What?!

305
00:16:05,207 --> 00:16:07,023
Trixie: Uh, I can't. I never have.

306
00:16:07,227 --> 00:16:08,094
No one can vanquish an Ursa Major.

307
00:16:08,945 --> 00:16:11,018
I just made the whole story up to make me look better!

308
00:16:11,175 --> 00:16:13,026
Snips and Snails: Made it up?!

309
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:18,098
(guttural growl)

310
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,046
(roar)

311
00:16:22,046 --> 00:16:24,027
(ponies gasp)

312
00:16:29,008 --> 00:16:30,003
(Twilight gulps)

313
00:16:31,097 --> 00:16:35,023
(Ursa growls, paws impact ground)

314
00:16:37,785 --> 00:16:42,000
(Twilight groans, wind blows)

315
00:16:41,964 --> 00:16:50,001
(lullaby-style music from cattails)

316
00:16:50,138 --> 00:16:56,008
(Ursa growls, subsides)
(lullaby-style music from cattails)

317
00:16:56,779 --> 00:16:59,001
(lullaby-style music from cattails)

318
00:16:59,147 --> 00:17:01,004
Spike: Nice use of Number 16!

319
00:17:01,035 --> 00:17:03,009
(rising volume magical chiming)

320
00:17:06,206 --> 00:17:09,001
(metal creaking)

321
00:17:09,132 --> 00:17:11,006
(water flowing)

322
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:13,007
(magical chiming)

323
00:17:17,212 --> 00:17:22,006
(cows mooing in contented surprise)
Deeper-voiced cow: Call me, don'tcha know?

324
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,006
Spike: ...That's new.

325
00:17:24,055 --> 00:17:26,005
(metallic clank)

326
00:17:26,454 --> 00:17:30,009
(Ursa growling sleepily)

327
00:17:34,627 --> 00:17:37,000
(Twilight grunting heavily)

328
00:17:39,132 --> 00:17:41,007
(Ursa slurping)

329
00:17:46,516 --> 00:17:48,001
(Ursa sucking noisily)

330
00:17:48,071 --> 00:17:50,001
(loud magical humming)

331
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:53,004
(sucking)

332
00:17:53,366 --> 00:17:56,009
(sucking)

333
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:01,005
(Twilight grunts exhaustedly)

334
00:18:01,493 --> 00:18:03,007
(ponies cheering)
Spike: Unbelievable!

335
00:18:03,861 --> 00:18:05,007
That was amazing!

336
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:10,002
Applejack: Heavens to Betsy! We knew you had ability, but not THAT much!

337
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:13,006
Twilight: I'm sorry! Please, please don't hate me!

338
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:15,001
Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Rarity: Hate you?!

339
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:17,006
Rarity: Why, whatever do you mean, darling?

340
00:18:17,607 --> 00:18:23,000
Twilight: Well, I know how much you all hated Trixie showing 
 off with her magic tricks, and I just thought-

341
00:18:22,994 --> 00:18:26,001
Rainbow Dash: Whoa, whoa, whoa. MAGIC'S got nothin' to do with it!

342
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:29,005
Rainbow Dash: Trixie's just a loudmouth.
Rarity: MOST unpleasant.

343
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,001
Applejack: All hat and no cattle.

344
00:18:31,121 --> 00:18:34,001
Twilight: So...you don't mind my magic tricks?

345
00:18:34,014 --> 00:18:37,002
Applejack: Your magic is a part o'who you are, sugarcube,

346
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,008
and we like who you are.

347
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:42,004
We're proud to have such a powerful, talented unicorn as our friend.

348
00:18:42,036 --> 00:18:46,004
Rainbow Dash: And after whuppin' that Ursa's hindquarters, we're even prouder!

349
00:18:46,354 --> 00:18:47,007
Twilight: You are?!

350
00:18:47,724 --> 00:18:49,004
Rainbow Dash: Uh-huh!
Applejack and Rarity: Mm-hmm!

351
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:53,002
Spike: Wow, Twilight! How'd you know what to do with that Ursa Major?!

352
00:18:53,203 --> 00:18:56,001
Twilight: That's what I was doing when you came looking for me!

353
00:18:56,129 --> 00:19:00,003
I was so intrigued by Trixie's bragging that I was 
 compelled to do a little reading up on them.

354
00:19:00,262 --> 00:19:03,009
Spike: So, it IS possible to vanquish an Ursa Major all by yourself?

355
00:19:03,885 --> 00:19:05,003
Twilight: That wasn't an Ursa Major.

356
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:07,005
That was a baby. An Ursa MINOR.

357
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:08,009
Trixie: THAT was just a baby?!

358
00:19:08,892 --> 00:19:13,002
Twilight: And it wasn't rampaging. It was just cranky because SOMEone woke it up.

359
00:19:13,173 --> 00:19:15,003
(Snips and Snails groan bashfully)

360
00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:20,008
Spike: Well...if that was an Ursa Minor, then... (fearfully) what's an Ursa MAJOR like?!

361
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:27,005
(Ursa Minor growls contentedly)

362
00:19:27,546 --> 00:19:28,007
Twilight: ...You don't wanna know.

363
00:19:28,707 --> 00:19:32,000
Trixie: (haughtily) Hah! You may have vanquished an Ursa MINOR,

364
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:35,006
but you will never have the amazing, show-stopping ability

365
00:19:35,626 --> 00:19:38,002
of the Great and Powerful Trixie!

366
00:19:38,227 --> 00:19:41,001
(poof, hooves clop into distance)

367
00:19:41,106 --> 00:19:42,005
Rainbow Dash: Why, that little...!

368
00:19:42,546 --> 00:19:44,002
Twilight: Just let her go.

369
00:19:44,218 --> 00:19:47,000
Maybe someday she'll learn her lesson.

370
00:19:48,258 --> 00:19:51,001
Now...About you two.

371
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:54,004
Snips: Uh, (nervous chuckle) we're sorry that we woke up the Ursa Minor...

372
00:19:54,356 --> 00:19:57,006
Snails: We just wanted to see some AWESOME MAGIC!

373
00:19:57,639 --> 00:20:02,002
Snips: Yeah! And the way you vanquished that Ursa Minor was...AWESOME!

374
00:20:05,348 --> 00:20:08,005
Snails: We deserve whatever punishment you give us.

375
00:20:08,506 --> 00:20:11,005
Twilight: For starters, you can clean up this mess.

376
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:16,006
And... What do you think, Spike? Should I give them... (ominously) Number 25?

377
00:20:16,586 --> 00:20:22,000
Spike: Ohhh, Twenty-five, yes! And I think I deserve it, too.

378
00:20:21,973 --> 00:20:23,001
Snips and Snails: Huh?!

379
00:20:23,134 --> 00:20:25,001
Twilight: I think you're right.

380
00:20:25,131 --> 00:20:26,008
(humming)

381
00:20:28,568 --> 00:20:31,001
(three pops)

382
00:20:31,076 --> 00:20:34,000
Snips, Snails, Spike: Sweeeet!

383
00:20:34,048 --> 00:20:36,008
Twilight: (voice-over) "Dear Princess Celestia,

384
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:40,003
I have learned a very valuable lesson about friendship.

385
00:20:40,317 --> 00:20:45,001
I was so afraid of being thought of as a show-off 
 that I was hiding a part of who I am.

386
00:20:45,054 --> 00:20:48,009
My friends helped me realize that it's okay to be proud of your talents,

387
00:20:48,908 --> 00:20:51,007
and there are times when it's appropriate to show them off...

388
00:20:51,741 --> 00:20:54,003
especially when you're standing up for your friends."

389
00:20:54,342 --> 00:20:58,009
Spike: So, you finally admit that you're the 
 most talented unicorn in all of Ponyville?

390
00:20:58,893 --> 00:21:00,008
Twilight: Well...yeah.

391
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,007
But it's nothing to brag about.

392
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,007
But it's nothing to brag about.

393
00:21:02,701 --> 00:21:05,003
So, uh, how did it go with Rarity?

394
00:21:05,302 --> 00:21:08,003
Spike: (sighs) She didn't go for the moustache.

395
00:21:08,274 --> 00:21:12,007
Twilight: You know, Spike, that moustache has nothing 
 to do with who you really are.

396
00:21:12,732 --> 00:21:15,001
Maybe you should just try being yourself!

397
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:18,006
Spike: Or...maybe the moustache wasn't enough!

398
00:21:18,584 --> 00:21:20,009
Maybe if I had a moustache AND a beard!

399
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:23,001
Twilight: Oh, not THIS again...

400
00:21:23,135 --> 00:21:26,009
Spike: Okay, imagine me with a nice, long Fu Manchu type beard.

401
00:21:26,896 --> 00:21:30,003
Or maybe a goatee. Or, no...

402
00:21:30,704 --> 00:21:32,006
(ending theme begins) My Little Pony

403
00:21:35,023 --> 00:21:36,009
My Little Pony

404
00:21:39,156 --> 00:21:48,000
(instrumental)

405
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:54,002
My Little Pony, friends
