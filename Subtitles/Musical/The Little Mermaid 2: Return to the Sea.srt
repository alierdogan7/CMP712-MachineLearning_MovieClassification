I'm so sorry.

Oh, nothing's wrong with you.

Being a teenager is hard,

- Melody?

It's Atlantica.

was just an old fish tale.

Where did you get this?

00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:09,175
I, I found it.

383
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:11,727
You went over the wall, didn't you?

384
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:15,439
Actually, I went under it.
I hate that stupid wall.

Melody, you know you're
not allowed in the sea.

But why?

387
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,191
And why does that necklace
have my name on it?

00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,863
Melody, listen to me.

389
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,531
You're hiding something from me.

390

You deliberately disobeyed me!

00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,493
I never want you going out there again!
It's dangerous in the sea!

It's time I trusted her with the truth.

Oh, now, child, it's gonna be okay.

You know, when I was a teenager

402
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:04,648
you couldn't get me
out of my shell for nothin'.

403
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,074
I had this high, squeaky voice

404

and these itty-bitty little pincers.

405
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:11,537
And then one day, boom!

412
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:32,558
I'm gonna find out myself.

Swim back as fast as you can and tell
my father. I'll try to find Melody.

Oh, but if that old sea witch is in there,
and then there's that mean little shark,

866
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:25,943
and then those manta rays come, and
then she takes those creepy tentacles

867
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:28,942
so suction cups stick to your face, and...

868
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:30,565
(SIGHS) Uh-uh.

869
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:32,946
No way you're going in there alone.

870
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:34,989
But, Flounder, if we both go,

871
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:37,788
who's going to tell Daddy
where Morgana's lair is?

872
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:41,242
What's all the whispering about?
Is Melody around here?

873
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:44,165
- Did you find her yet? If she's...
- Scuttle!

00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,212
(WHISPERS) Get down and be quiet.

875
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,419
Wait a minute.

876
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:50,092
Scuttle can get help.

877
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:56,345
Scuttle, I need you
to pay very close attention.

878
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:59,226
We're doomed.

879
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,849
Oh, there you are, darling!

880
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:04,853
Oh, I was so worried about you.

881
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:08,778
And look!
You've brought back my trident.

882
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:12,072
- Clever girl.
- Give it to her! Give it to her!

883
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,032
Hey!

884
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:17,408
Forgive him, dear.
He's got a little size issue.

885
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:20,831
Now, if you'll just hand over the...

886
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:23,625

- I was trying to protect you.
- By fencing me in?

You knew how much I loved the sea.

Why did you keep the truth from me?
