Listen, Sonny, I told you.
I don't know who she is.

98
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,489
She never filed a W-2
and she never got a check.

99
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,246
And if I never paid her,
she just doesn't exist.

she doesn't exist?

How can you not know who she is?
You took the picture.

107
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:19,472
Listen, this sounds strange, but there
wasn't supposed to be a model on this cover.

108
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,522

109

Whoo!

173
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,734
You're a real Errol Flynn, kid.

174
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,195
What other stunts do you do?

175
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,837
Man, this whole thing
is screwing me up.

176
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,247
What whole thing? Ah, nothing.

177
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,575
Come on, have a cup of coffee.

178
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:14,498
Sometimes the best person to
tell something to is a stranger.

179
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,958
Go on. What's on your mind?

180
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,167
Okay.

181
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,921
I run into this girl
this morning.

182
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,550
Never saw her before in my life.

183
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,724
She kisses me and disappears.

184
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,893
So what's so weird about that?

185
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,311
What's so weird about that is

186
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:32,107
that 10 minutes later I see her picture
on an album cover I'm supposed to paint.

187
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,604
I mean, that's crazy, right?

188
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:38,734
Well, if I said it sounded crazy,
would you stop looking for her?

189
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,941
No. Then why ask?

190
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,197
So I'll keep looking for her.

191
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,538
Okay, kid, but take
a tip from me.

192
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:49,953
What's that?

193
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,869
Don't look underwater anymore.

194
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,380
Thanks a lot.

195
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,337
Hey, Al, where you going?

196
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,923
Hey, Sonny.
It's good to see you, man.

197
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,303
How you doing, Big Al?

198
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,386
How could I go wrong with the great
paint job you did on my van?

199
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,891
Hey, and the chicks love it.

200
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,268
Yeah. It's one of the
finer examples of my work.

201
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,187
It's beautiful, man.
Where you headed?

202
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,483
East. Where you going? West.

00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,311
Hang on. I'll give you a ride.
No, that's cool.

204
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:22,069
Forget it. I owe you one.
All right. Okay, hit it.

We're taking the scenic route.

I'm back here.

on the album cover!

208
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,624
Slow down, I wanna get off here.

209
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,301

Hey, I've been asking
about you all day.

234

You may not believe this, but I'm
painting an album cover and you're on it.

235
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,241
Why shouldn't I believe it?

236
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,911
Because before today,
I never laid eyes on you.

237
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,080
Now I've seen you three times
in one day.

238
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,283
That's a little
too coincidental.

239
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,664
Sounds like
you don't believe it.

240
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,544
Well, with all
that's happened to me today,

to tell you the truth,
I don't believe it.

You're right. It's too coincidental.
Someone must be setting us up.

What do you mean?
Hey, wait a minute!

00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,672
I didn't have anything
to do with this!

00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,132
Really?

246

Yes. I can practice my skating

like the album cover I gave you.

Is that too difficult?

283
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,284
If you want me to work,
I'll work.

00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:27,119

argue, I can get into that, too.

all this time on the girl for?

she really looks.

have it done?

will be done

I make a lot of money,

318

and people respond when I call.

319
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:04,225
That's because I smartened up
and I gave up art.

the right decision.

So was Beethoven,
but I know who he is.

345
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,979
Do you like Glenn Miller?

346
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:34,056
Do you like rock and roll?
I love rock and roll.

347
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,482
I love Glenn Miller.

348
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:42,739
(WHISTLES)

349
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,484
This place is incredible.

350
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,614
It belonged to a silent
movie star.

351
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:50,324
(CHUCKLES) Obviously, they did
things big in those days.

352

What do you do
with all this space?

353
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,496
Nothing really.

354
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:56,829
But I love this room because it
makes my records sound great.

355
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,165
Well, I've only got
one thing to say.

356
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,795
Remember, I gave you
some popcorn.

357
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:04,549
(LAUGHING) Okay. But you came
here to listen to Glenn Miller.

358
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,097
So, all set up. There he goes.

359
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:12,307
Nothing like that sound, huh?
That sound was a miracle.

360
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:13,512
Hey, Danny, that's you.

361
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,847
Yeah.

362
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:19,272
Hey, this girl...
Danny, there's this girl...

363
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,020
Listen.

364
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:23,697
<i>(PLAYING CLARINET)</i>

365
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:24,864
That's me.

366
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,114
Hey, that's all right.
You got any more surprises?

367
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,699
This is what I call
my memorabilia room.

368
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,534
Sort of the story
of Danny McGuire.

369
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,086
Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman.
You really knew those guys?

370
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,381
Yeah. We used to all
hang out together.

371
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,709
After I toured with Miller,
I got my own band

372
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:46,045
and my own club
on West 51 st Street.

373
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:48,802
It was small and jam-packed,

374
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,975
but everybody who was in town
would drop by.

375
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,520
Sometimes they'd sit in
for a set or two.

376
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:57,682
Well, now it's a parking lot.

377
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,608
Why did you give it up?

378
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,937
Oh, it was one of those
turning points

379
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,318
where you turn
in the wrong direction.

380
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,779
It was a girl.

381
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,735
The girl on the album.

382
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,279
Yeah.

383
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,745
The singer with the band.

384
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:19,454
When she left,
I figured she'd be back,

385
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:23,003
and I wasn't about
to run after her, right?

386
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,254
(CHUCKLES)

387
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,677
Boy, did I teach her a lesson.

388
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,630
Never saw her again.

389
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,968
After that, the heart went
out of my music.

390
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:35,803
I went into the family
construction business

391
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:38,685
and became what
they call comfortable.

392
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,142
Three cheers for comfort.

393
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:42,943
You ever think about
going back into music?

394
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,864
No. Only about
20 or 30 times a day.

395
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,486
(LAUGHS)

396
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,613
So, you gonna do it?

397
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,491
Well, I can't play clarinet
like I did in the old days.

398
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:57,541
But you know something, kid? I'd
love to open up another joint again.

399
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,459
Why don't you?

400
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,958
I've had real estate agents
looking for two years.

401
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,789
They can't find the right place.

402
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,591
Well, if it's just a place you
want, that seems pretty easy.

403
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:09,011
No, it's not easy. It's kind
of like falling in love.

404
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:12,386
You gotta feel a special
attachment, a special...

405
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,842
Like you and your friend...
Kira.

406

See, it's simple.
Your friend has a dream,

594

and you want to be involved in
something you really believe in.

Well, maybe his dream is big
enough for the both of you.

that dreams come easy, and...

what they believe in.

a history of success.

602
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:55,312

DANNY:
Oh, that explains everything.

610
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:17,411
Hey, Danny, don't you think there's a
certain kind of aura about this place?

611
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,542
Well, if that's what you call
it, it's got it all right.

612
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,669
Let's see the rest of it.

613
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:26,382
Of course, it's not small and
intimate like my club in New York.

614
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:31,308
But then again, that was back in
1945 and things are bigger now.

615
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:35,687
(CHUCKLES) And this place...
Whoo. Sure is big.

616
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:37,059
SONNY: Yeah, it is.

617
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:39,391
Yeah. Well, I don't know.
I don't know.

618
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:42,569
Naturally, I can't take
all this too seriously.

619
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:46,568
But if I were going to do something
about it, and I can't say I am

620
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,320
because, you see, I'm a builder,

621
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,494
and a builder has to take his
time deciding these things.

622
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:54,914
But if I were going to
do something about it,

623
00:42:54,989 --> 00:43:00,211
just speaking hypothetically,
it just might work.

624
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,583
You think so?

625
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,165
Might. If I planned it right.

626
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:07,464

00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:15,729
I haven't been crazy
for over 35 years.

I'm gonna do it. And, kid, I'm
giving you half the place.

You're gonna be my partner.

724

I can't do that, Danny.
I can't take that.

Why?

726
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:26,399
I don't know the first thing
about being a partner.

727
00:50:26,482 --> 00:50:31,033
Well, it's easy. We share the
responsibilities and we argue a lot.

728
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:34,123
It's like being married,
without the good part.

Come on, kid. ls it a deal?

730

Now, I can't wait. I gotta look
over every inch of this place.

734
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:48,804
I only wish we could see better.

735
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,079
I got a flashlight in the car.

736
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,053
Will you get it? Yeah.

737
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:54,976
It's our first collaboration
as partners.

738
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:58,977
And, oh, partner? Partner,
what'll we name the place?

739
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:07,277
Yeah. What the hell to call it?

I don't think so.

751
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:50,074
Because?

Well, I mean... I don't know.
I was thinking that I...

00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:57,578
Oh, I'm sorry. Forget it.

754
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:00,667
So, you're gonna do it?

755
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:03,837
Yes, we're gonna do it.

756
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:06,631
Total insanity.
Only if you think so.

757
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:10,086
Well, even if it is,
it's worth a try.

758
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:16,760
Xanadu. How do you think
that'll look on a marquee?

759
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:20,187
Hmm, wonderful. SONNY: Hey!

760
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:23,106
When did you get here?
Just a minute ago.

761

What'd I tell you, Danny? One minute
she's here, the next minute, who knows?

Guess what you own

00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,234
Xanadu.

00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,680
Who cares what's going on. Just
get out before he gets here.

777
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:04,481
Yeah. I'll fix everything up.
I'll tell him it was a joke.

Hey, wait a minute. Relax. It's okay.
Are you loaded?

779
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,107
Because, when you sober up,
you're gonna be real sorry.

780
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,188
He should be coming in
just about now.

Malone, what the hell
is going on?

782
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:17,995
Simpson, I've worked like a dog
trying to make Tuesday Wednesday.

783

I couldn't do it.
I must be a failure.

Is he straight?

785
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,457
You told me if I didn't do things
the right way, I'd be fired.

786
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:27,880
Well, you were right.

787
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:28,956
Huh?

788
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:31,087
I'm fired!

789
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,048
Malone, I want you
out of here in five minutes.

790
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:38,474
That's five minutes, Malone, and if
it's six, just keep walking. Got it?

791
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:41,936
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
I'm doing it!

you want, it's on the house.

No.

anything about you.

where you were born.

Yeah, but where's the apartment?

814

On the second floor.

815
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:48,786
Look, I don't even know
how to find you.

816

Yeah, but you always do. Okay.

817

What's your last name?

Same as my father's
and mother's.

Yeah, but what is it? What?
My father's or my mother's?

I don't care. Either one.
Same as mine.

00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:58,809
Hey, hey. Give me a break. It's
only the end of the first week.

864
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:01,236
So what? We're gonna celebrate
at the end of every week.

865
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,029
All right. I won't argue
with that. Cheers.

866
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:05,528
Two cheers. Two cheers.

867
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,985
You know, when you guys told
me you were building a dream,

868
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:09,820
I thought you were crazy. Yeah?

869
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:13,203
Most people want skyscrapers
you put up in 20 minutes.

870
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,496
It's gonna be beautiful in there.
Thank you.

871
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:18,419
All right. See you guys next week.
You bet.

872
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:23,592
Hey, Sonny, I thought we should have
one special toast, just the two of us.

873
00:58:24,126 --> 00:58:25,673
I've never had a partner before.

874
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:28,346
I've never watched
a dream come true.

875
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:31,850
Hey, there's not much left.
But, still vintage.

876
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,472
Only the best.

877
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:36,271
To Sonny Malone. Danny McGuire.

878
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,394

KIRA: Hello.

880
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:42,027
How's it all going?

881
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:43,945
So far so good.

882
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,865
Kira, I want you
to promise me one thing.

883
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:47,940
Anything.

884
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:50,281
On opening night,
I get the first dance.

885
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,488
Okay. You're gonna dance?

886
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:55,370
Oh, I've been known
to twinkle a toe or two.

887
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:59,124
Listen, if you're gonna dance,
you have to wear something...

888
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:01,625
That looks special.
You need some...

889
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:02,877
Glitz.

890
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,134
"Glitz"?
Something sharp looking.

891
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:08,052
You know, something with
a bit of pizzazz to it.

892
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:09,801
Hot. DANNY: Oh.

893
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,383
Well, if I need some... Glitz.

894
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:15,970
...glitz, then I gotta go get some.
Where do you go to get it?

895
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:18,556
At a franchised glitz dealer.

All right, what's next, boss?

Well, we're down to little
details. Fountains, yes.

960
01:03:56,833 --> 01:04:00,303
The mirrors, yes. Next, we
need those new parking signs.

961
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:02,130
Oh, the signs are here. We
just haven't put them up yet.

Well, come on. Give me a hand.
Let's get them up.

to you about the sound system.

Oh, just here and there. Don't
tell anybody, but I'm nervous.

01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:21,616
What about?

970
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:26,659
Well, I haven't had
an opening night since 1945.

971
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:29,207
Wow! I guess I got the jitters.

972
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:32,877
Well, just pretend we're
back in 1945 all over again.

973
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:34,954
I don't have to pretend.

974
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:38,751
It is 1945 all over again.

975
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:43,634
Well, that takes care of that.

976
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,590
Sonny, don't worry
about that sound system.

977
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:48,347
I looked over it twice today
and it's fine.

978
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:50,178
You kids go on home.

986

All of it, everything.

987
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:31,060
We can't go on pretending
this is for real.

988

I know, it is hard to believe.

989
01:05:33,513 --> 01:05:36,813
I can't have
these kind of feelings.

990
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:38,939
It's beginning to hurt.

991
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:41,771
This part of it was
never supposed to happen.

992
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:43,653
I don't understand.

993
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,736
What do you mean, "hurt"?

994
01:05:47,819 --> 01:05:50,789
I know I shouldn't,
but I do, and it's crazy.

995
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:55,209
Sonny, there's something I
have to tell you about myself.

996
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:56,502
I know all I need to know.

997
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:58,876
No, I have to tell you.
I have no choice.

998
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:02,417
All I was sent to do
was to make Xanadu happen.

999
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,377
SONNY: I don't get it.

1000
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:08,466
Sonny, you have to believe me when I tell
you that I never wanted to hurt you.

1001
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:11,427
That was the last thing
I wanted to happen.

1002
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:15,014
I'm not as I appear to you.

1003
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:18,563
Have you ever heard the
expression, "Kissed by a muse"?

1004
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:21,190
That's what I am. I'm a muse.

1005
01:06:21,269 --> 01:06:22,987
I'm glad somebody's
having a good time.

1006
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:25,690
Please don't make a joke.
I'm serious.

1008
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:33,874
I'm the daughter of Zeus. I have
eight sisters. My real name is...

1009
01:06:36,743 --> 01:06:38,962
Are you telling me
that's not real?

1010
01:06:39,037 --> 01:06:42,632
I'm trying to tell you the truth.
Why don't you believe me?

1011
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:45,923
Look up the word "muse"
in the dictionary. Go on.

<i>Brend♪s the only one
that saw me at the racetrack.</i>

1033
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:59,793
<i>Now if the lady says
she's a muse, she's a muse.</i>

1034
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:02,541
<i>Who's that? Brenda!</i>

1035
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:04,168
Kira.

1036
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:05,998
<i>Sonny.</i>

1037
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:09,260
(GASPS)

1038
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:11,258
<i>NICK: I think he needs a drink.</i>

1039
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:14,090
It's okay.
I'll take care of it. Thanks.

1040
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:17,427
<i>NICK: Good luck on the opening
of your joint, kid.</i>

1041
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:21,347
<i>Wish I could be there.</i>

1042
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:27,062
Oh, wow!

1043
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,485
Oh, Sonny.

1044
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:34,156
We've been painted
by Michelangelo.

1045
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:37,114
Shakespeare's written
sonnets about us.

1046
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:40,120
Beethoven's played music for us.

1047
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:44,170
We're not supposed to feel
emotion or show any feelings.

1048
01:08:44,245 --> 01:08:46,839
Muses are just supposed
to inspire.

1049
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:51,761
I fell in love.

1050
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:53,842
You did?

1051
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:57,638
Well, what do you think
happened to me?

1052
01:08:57,717 --> 01:09:00,470
It was a mistake.
I broke the rules.

1053
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:02,806
Well, now what the hell
do we do, huh?

1054
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:04,357
Answer that, muse!

1055
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:05,479
I don't know.

1056
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:09,028
I'm sorry. lt just never
should have happened.

1057
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:10,980
Well, it did.

1058
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:12,737
I love you, Sonny.

1059
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:18,572
Kira.

1060
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:22,037
I'll love you forever.

1061
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:24,831
I Will.

1062
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:26,834
I'll love you forever.

1063
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:30,925
Kira! Wait!

1064
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:34,261
<i>I'll love you forever.</i>

1065
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:45,724
Hey, painter! I've been looking for you.
Where you been?

1066
01:09:45,807 --> 01:09:46,933
Here.

1067
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:49,356
Well, how do I look?

1068
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:52,735
Aren't you gonna say anything
about my new threads?

1069
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:55,199
Hubba, hubba.

1070
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:59,450
Well, we're gonna
miss you tonight.

1071
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:02,122
It won't be any fun without you.

1072
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:04,451
I told you. I can't go.

1073
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:07,629
Xanadu doesn't matter anymore.

1074
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:11,379
What do you mean, it doesn't matter?
How can it not matter?

1075
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:14,677
This was our dream.
Well, wasn't it?

1076
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:19,724
There's no Xanadu
'cause there's no Kira.

1077
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,268
She made it real.

1078
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:25,972
So find her! Bring her back!

1079
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:28,558
Dreams die.

1080
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:29,893
No.

1081
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:33,901
No, no, no. Not by themselves.
We kill them.

1082
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:36,859
Now, if you give up,
you'll be sitting on that rock

1083
01:10:36,941 --> 01:10:39,569
30 years from now,
just like I was.

1084
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:44,123
I know how you feel, kid. I
felt the same way once. I did.

1085
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:46,747
I didn't know
how important love is.

1086
01:10:47,535 --> 01:10:49,754
But let me tell you something.

1087
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:53,879
Somehow, somewhere,
there's a way to get her!

1088
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:56,711
If she got here,
there's a way to get there.

1089
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:59,468
Believe me, kid, it's up to you.

1090
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:03,346
It's up to you.

1091
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:15,982
<i>(MUSIC PLAYING)</i>

1092
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:29,578
<i>I see the early glow</i>

1093
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:32,584
<i>I hear you say hello</i>

1094
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:37,840

<i>I see a tear in your eye</i>

<i>It's a lie
I don't believe it's so</i>

1103
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:10,995
<i>It's a lie</i>

1104
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:15,297

<i>How could I know</i>

1106
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:20,007
<i>I was only dreaming</i>

<i>Now that you're gone</i>

1109
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:28,304

1110
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:31,977
<i>I take the fall</i>

1111
01:12:46,571 --> 01:12:48,915
<i>I take the fall</i>

1112
01:12:50,741 --> 01:12:54,746
<i>I see you in a dream</i>

1113
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:57,958
<i>You turn and start to go</i>

1114
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,300
<i>I call to you once more</i>

1115
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:05,427
<i>Guess that I'm taking the fall</i>

1116
01:13:05,506 --> 01:13:09,602
<i>It's a lie
I don't believe it's so</i>

1117
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:12,226

01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:36,796
<i>I take the fall</i>

1125
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:27,842
Kira.

1126
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:30,675
Sonny. How did you get here?

1127
01:14:30,758 --> 01:14:33,181
You didn't think I'd let you
get away from me, did you?

1128
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:34,682
You'll have to go back.

1129
01:14:34,762 --> 01:14:36,810
Okay, I'm ready. Let's go.

1130
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:44,071
I can't go with you, but you have
to get out before it's too late.

1131
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:45,989
Too late for what?

1132
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:49,035
Oh, please, you took
a big chance coming here.

1133
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:53,202
What's going on here? I'm
taking you back with me, Kira.

1134
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:56,534
It can't be done. Nobody's
ever taken anyone out of here.

1135
01:14:56,617 --> 01:14:59,166
Not in the whole history of...
The whole history.

1136
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:01,293
I'll make them let you go.

1137
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:03,750
Hey, Zeus!

1138
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:06,461
Zeus, you hear me? Oh, God.

1139
01:15:06,544 --> 01:15:08,842
I wanna talk to you.

1140
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:12,471
<i>ZEUS: We don't use those
old-fashioned names anymore.</i>

1141
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:17,017
<i>In any case, it's me
you want to speak to.</i>

1142
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:18,188
I've come to get Kira.

1143
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:21,188
<i>She's not leaving!
It's impossible!</i>

1144
01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:25,446
That's what you think.
That's what you think.

1145
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:27,569
How'd you know
I was gonna say that?

1146
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:30,367
<i>Put it this way.
I'm a good guesser.</i>

1147
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:32,529
What else do you know?

1148
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:33,863
<i>Everything.</i>

1149
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:36,165
All right, then. You know this.

1150
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,914
I'm sticking to this place
till hell freezes over.

1151
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:40,040
Sonny!

1152
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:44,044
<i>You'll leave now
and you'll leave without Kira!</i>

1153
01:15:44,123 --> 01:15:47,548
Why? <i>Because other
people have dreams.</i>

1154
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:49,173
So send another muse.

1155
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:51,756
You got muses running
around all over the place.

1156
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:54,137
<i>One dream, one muse.</i>

1157
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:58,141
Wait... Wait a minute.
Just listen to me, okay?

1158
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:03,267
Kira and I love each other.

1159
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:06,229
Now I don't know how often that
happens in this kind of place,

1160
01:16:06,312 --> 01:16:08,861
but back on Earth,
it's pretty rare.

1161
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:12,989
We need to be together.

1162
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:14,366
<i>All right, that's enough.</i>

1163
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:17,915
<i>You're leaving. Kir♪s staying.
No more discussions.</i>

1164
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:21,085
<i>Those are the rules
and that's all there is to it.</i>

1165
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:24,414
<i>WOMAN: On the other hand, dear,
rules were made to be broken.</i>

1166
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:26,090
<i>ZEUS:
We'll talk about that later.</i>

1167
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:28,759
<i>WOMAN: Which is later
and which is earlier?</i>

1168
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:31,804
<i>WOMAN: I keep forgetting.</i>
KIRA: <i>Just</i> a <i>minute!</i>

1169
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:34,428
Isn't anyone interested
in my feelings?

1170
01:16:34,507 --> 01:16:36,430
<i>What do you mean, "feelings"?</i>

1171
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:37,977
<i>Oh, you remember, pet.</i>

1172
01:16:38,052 --> 01:16:41,602
<i>We learnt about feelings
in our mortal history class.</i>

1173
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,148
Yes, feelings.

1174
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:47,270
I guess that's what
you call them.

1175
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:50,072
I've never really
had them before.

1176
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:53,071
I've never felt this way
about anyone before.

1177
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:57,746
And I've never asked
to leave here. Not ever.

1178
01:16:57,822 --> 01:16:59,790
Not once in the whole
time I've been here.

1179
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:04,211
<i>WOMAN: No, it's true, dear, she hasn't.
Not in all these centuries.</i>

1180
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:07,665
<i>Or is it minutes?
I do keep mixing them up.</i>

1181
01:17:07,748 --> 01:17:12,470
Please, can't we just have this one night?
Just one night?

1182
01:17:12,545 --> 01:17:16,641
<i>ZEUS: No, no, it's just not possible.
Goodbye, Sonny Malone.</i>

1183
01:17:16,715 --> 01:17:18,262
(He)', Kira?

1184
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:20,720
Just one moment?

1185
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:22,851
<i>ZEUS: Goodbye, Sonny.</i>

1186
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:24,891
Kira!

1187
01:17:35,526 --> 01:17:40,407
<i>A child and a fool in one</i>

1188
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:45,336
<i>So sure I could need no one</i>

1189
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:51,714
<i>My heart always on the run
to nowhere</i>

1190
01:17:55,212 --> 01:18:00,093
<i>Now as you're holding me</i>

1191
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:05,023
<i>My heart is reminding me</i>

1192
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:09,648
<i>That now I could never be</i>

1193
01:18:09,727 --> 01:18:11,855
<i>Without you</i>

1194
01:18:14,648 --> 01:18:19,495
<i>But how can our love succeed?</i>

1195
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:24,371
<i>A miracle is what we need</i>

1196
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:28,705
<i>And so I appeal to you</i>

1197
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:36,921
<i>To keep me suspended
in time with you</i>

1198
01:18:37,004 --> 01:18:40,599
<i>Don't let this moment die</i>

1199
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:46,723
<i>I get a feeling
when I'm with you</i>

1200
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:51,402
