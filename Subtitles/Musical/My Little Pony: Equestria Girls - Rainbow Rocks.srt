1
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,387
- What?!
- ( Overlapping chatter)

2
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,474
(vocalizing )

3
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,659
That was barely
worth the effort, Adagio.

4
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:40,905
I'm tired of fast food.
I need a meal.

5
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:44,329
The energy in this world
isn't the same as in Equestria.

6
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,123
We can only gain
so much power here.

7
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:50,464
Ugh, I wish we'd never
been banished to this awful place.

8
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,550
Really?
I love it here.

9
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:57,592
For realsies? Because I think
this place is the worst.

10
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,805
I think you're the worst,
Sonata.

11
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,267
Oh, yeah?
Well, I think you're--

12
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:05,058
(groans)
I'll tell you one thing--

13
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,805
being stuck here
with you two

14
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,434
isn't making this world
any more bearable.

15
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,297
( gasps )
Did you feel that?

16
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,676
Do you know what that is?

17
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,045
Both: Uh-uh.

18
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:40,764
It's Equestrian magic.

19
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:44,101
But this world doesn't
have Equestrian magic.

20
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,560
It does now.

21
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,806
And we're going to use it
to make everyone

22
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:52,980
in this pathetic
little world adore us.

23
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:01,117
( music playing )

24
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,457
We used to fight
with each other

25
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,670
Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa

26
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,789
That was before
we discovered

27
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,134
Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa

28
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,218
Back when your
friendship was real

29
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,259
Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa

30
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,474
Yeah, you just say
what you feel

31
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,935
And the music

32
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,804
Yeah, the music

33
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,307
Gets us to the top

34
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,484
As we learn how the rainbow

35
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,777
Rainbow rocks

36
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,659
You can pick up the bass

37
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:52,661
Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa

38
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,005
And you can play the guitar

39
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,374
Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa

40
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,592
You can bang on the drums

41
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,461
Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa

42
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,681
Or you can sing like a star

43
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,425
And the music

44
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,803
Yeah, the music

45
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,430
Gets us to the top

46
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,861
As we learn
how the rainbow

47
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,071
Rainbow rocks

48
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,366
As we learn
how the rainbow

49
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,784
Rainbow rocks.

50
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,468
( chatter)

51
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,950
- Want some help?
- Uh, no, thanks. We're good.

52
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:16,287
Oh, okay.

53
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,919
Sunset Shimmer,
over here!

54
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,586
( chatter continues )

55
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,806
(gasping, whispering )

56
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,438
(sighs) I had no idea
the whole school would be here.

57
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,728
Quite the eye-catching
advertisement if I do say so myself.

58
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,479
And it smells like cake.

59
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,403
It does?
( sniffs )

60
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,776
I used frosting
instead of paste.

61
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:51,656
Uh, Fluttershy, you've got
a little something... uh...

62
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:57,036
- Did I get it?
- Not exactly.

63
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:00,831
Good afternoon,
students.

64
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,003
Ijust wanted
to tell you all

65
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,593
how pleased I am
that so many of you

66
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,883
are going to participate
in the first ever

67
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,553
Canterlot High School
musical showcase.

68
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,427
( cheering )

69
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,646
This is a wonderful
opportunity

70
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,357
to raise money for all
our after-school programs

71
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:20,851
here at CHS.

72
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,228
So keep working on
those signs and posters.

73
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,946
I think it's going to be

74
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,987
one of the most exciting
events we've had at CHS

75
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,861
since the Fall Formal.

76
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,880
I am never gonna
live that down.

77
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,344
You were pretty bad
at the Fall Formal.

78
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:52,887
A demon. I turned into
a raging she-demon.

79
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,759
And tried to turn everyone here
into teenage zombies

80
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,433
for your own
personal army.

81
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,852
Oh, darling, you have us.

82
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,227
And we've forgiven you
for your past-- ahem-- boo-boos.

83
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,774
To be honest, I'd say
the whole experience

84
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,274
brought everyone at Canterlot High
closer than ever before.

85
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,072
One, two, three.

86
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,194
There was a time
we were apart

87
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,242
But that's behind us now

88
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,786
See how we've made
a brand-new start

89
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,659
And the future's
looking up

90
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:20,956
Oh, oh

91
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,545
And when you
walk these halls

92
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,915
You feel it everywhere

93
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,883
Yeah, we're
the Wondercolts forever

94
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:29,253
Oh, yeah

95
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,005
We are all together

96
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,632
Oh, oh, oh

97
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,510
Now is better than ever

98
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,227
Oh, oh, oh

99
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,937
You can feel it

100
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:45,060
We are back and I 'm so glad
that we're better

101
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,062
Better than ever

102
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,235
Oh, wha, oh, wha, oh

103
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,574
Oh, yeah,
we're better than ever

104
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,661
Oh, wha, oh, wha, oh

105
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:58,954
There was a time we couldn't see
past the differences

106
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,374
That separated you and me
and it left us on our own

107
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,289
But now you walk these halls

108
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,337
And friends are everywhere

109
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:11,462
Yeah, we're
the Wondercolts forever

110
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:12,803
Oh, yeah

111
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,595
We are all together

112
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,217
Oh, oh, oh

113
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,811
Now is better than ever

114
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,396
Oh, oh, oh

115
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,983
Now that we are back on track

116
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:28,945
Yes, I 'm so glad that we're better

117
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,905
Better than ever

118
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,695
Oh, wha, oh, wha, oh

119
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,069
Oh, yeah,
we're better than ever

120
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,070
Oh, wha, oh, wha, oh

121
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,243
Oh, yeah,
we're better than ever

122
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,457
Oh, wha, oh, wha, oh

123
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,544
Oh, yeah,
we're better than ever.

124
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:50,671
( laughs) I still can't believe
that happens when we play.

125
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:53,591
Ooh, I've got to look
into some new accessories.

126
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,964
Something that looks good
in a longer ponytail.

127
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,887
Ooh, maybe some
clip-on earrings

128
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,226
for when I get those
adorable pony ears.

129
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,721
I just wonder
why it happens.

130
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,565
Princess Twilight took
her crown back to Equestria.

131
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,151
Shouldn't that mean she took
all the magic back with her?

132
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,646
Who cares why it happens?

133
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,239
It makes my band
totally awesome.

134
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,233
Oh, your band?

135
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,861
Duh, it was my idea
to start the Rainbooms

136
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,533
so we could be
in the showcase.

137
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,372
Plus, I'm the lead singer
and guitarist.

138
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,661
( knock on door)

139
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,705
Heard you outside.

140
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,578
You guys are sounding
really tight.

141
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,546
Uh, we're getting there.

142
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,041
Rarity's still coming in a little late
on the second verse

143
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:34,169
and App|ejack's bass solo
could use a little work.

144
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,592
They'll get it together
in time for the showcase.

145
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,845
Uh, I don't suppose

146
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:43,561
any of our friends
from out of town might come?

147
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,771
It being a special
charity event and all.

148
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,143
Sorry, Flash, I don't think
Twilight's gonna be back

149
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,144
at Canterlot
High any time soon.

150
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,522
Oh, yeah. Okay.

151
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,024
Just, you know,
thought I'd ask.

152
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:59,028
Uh, keep on rocking it.

153
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,283
Well, someone is quite
the smitten kitten.

154
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,251
Ooh, sorry.

155
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,247
I always forget you and Flash
used to be an item.

156
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,497
It's okay.

157
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,715
Flash is a great guy and all,

158
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,800
but I never really
liked him liked him.

159
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,341
I was just using him
to become more popular.

160
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:20,591
(sighs ) The old me
really was just awful, wasn't she?

161
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,888
— ( muttering )
- Yup.

162
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,979
But the important thing
is that you've turned yourself around.

163
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,472
Thanks, Applejack.

164
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:31,397
But I'm not sure everyone else
at CHS feels the same way.

165
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,521
Woman on P.A.: Sunset Shimmer,
please report to the main foyer.

166
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:38,116
Gotta run. I volunteered to show some
new students around the school.

167
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,451
Thought it would be good
for them to get to know the new me

168
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:44,072
before they heard
all the stuff about the old me.

169
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,826
We've still got a few minutes
before lunch starts,

170
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,500
what do you say we do
"Awesome as I Wanna Be"?

171
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,588
Um, Rainbow Dash,

172
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,925
I was wondering if we maybe
could play the song I wrote.

173
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,885
We'll get to it.

174
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,845
Oh, okay.

175
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,474
Hi. Are you the girls
I'm supposed to show around?

176
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,719
We are.

177
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,271
Canterlot High
is a great school.

178
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:10,606
You're really
gonna love it.

179
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,191
Oh, yes.

180
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:16,563
We really sense there's something
magical about this place.

181
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,035
That's the science lab.

182
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,870
Computer lab
is in there.

183
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,333
Ooh, we're having a big
musical showcase this weekend.

184
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,872
The whole school is
pretty much rallying around it.

185
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:34,544
A musical showcase?

186
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,258
I'm sure since you're new,
Principal Celestia

187
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,423
will let you sign up
if you're interested.

188
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:42,718
We have been known to sing
from time to time.

189
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,888
Hello?
We sing, like, all the time.

190
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,307
It's how we get people
to do what we want.

191
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,272
- ( groans )
- What did I say?

192
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,141
What you meant to say

193
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,268
was that being in
a musical showcase

194
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,192
sounds like a great way
to meet other students.

195
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,734
Oh, yeah.

196
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,483
What she said,
I meant to say.

197
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,735
That's what I meant...
to say.

198
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:07,990
And what you would have said
if you weren't the worst.

199
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,536
You are.

200
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,284
You have to excuse them.
They're idiots.

201
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:12,581
Both: Hmmph.

202
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,044
Sunset:
Those are pretty.

203
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,922
Where did you--

204
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,015
( laughs)

205
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:29,181
Sorry. These pendants
mean an awful lot to us.

206
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,976
We'd just hate for anything
to happen to them.

207
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,821
( chatter)

208
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:50,411
- So how was the tour?
- I don't know.

209
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,454
I mean, these girls,
they were--

210
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,418
there was something off
about them.

211
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,287
Like off like this?

212
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,789
Or off like this?

213
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,291
Or-- ooh, |ike--

214
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,090
Maybe we should
just let her tell us?

215
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,805
That's just it.
I can't put my finger on it.

216
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,301
They just acted sort of
strange around me.

217
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,848
Maybe someone already
talked to them.

218
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,562
Told them about what I did.

219
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,683
(sighs ) So much for making
a good first impression.

220
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:19,027
Uh—huh.

221
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,896
Ooh, that's
probably not it.

222
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,276
This is it, girls.

223
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,073
The moment we've
been waiting for.

224
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,662
Lunch?

225
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,329
(groans ) The chance to get our
true Equestrian magic back.

226
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,793
Oh, right.

227
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,457
Our voices are
just strong enough

228
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,001
to make them want
something so badly,

229
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,421
they'll fight to get it.

230
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,512
So we're just gonna do
what we always do?

231
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,302
Stir up some trouble
and then feed off the negative energy?

232
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,299
Some plan, Adagio.

233
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,893
It won't be the same
as the times before.

234
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,229
There is Equestrian
magic here.

235
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:59,021
Their negative energy
will give us the power we need

236
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,316
to get this entire world
to do our bidding.

237
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,655
But we can get lunch after,
though, right?

238
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,321
It's Taco Tuesday.

239
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,944
- Just follow my lead.
- Or my lead.

240
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,162
My lead.

241
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,670
(vocalizing )

242
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,433
We heard you want
to get together

243
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:45,155
We heard you want
to rock this school

244
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:50,235
We've got something
that is better

245
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:55,535
Something that changes
all the rules

246
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,577
Why pretend
we're all the same?

247
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:04,591
When some of us
shine brighter

248
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,129
Here's a chance
to find your flame

249
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:14,175
Are you a loser or a fighter?

250
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,687
Me and you,
you and me

251
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,431
Why don't we see
who is better?

252
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:24,902
We don't have to be
one and the same thing

253
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:29,490
Oh, what's so wrong
with a little competition?

254
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:34,909
Are you afraid of failing
the audition?

255
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,033
You're a star
and you should know it

256
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:43,170
Now you rise above the rest

257
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:47,467
It doesn't matter who you hurt

258
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,137
If you're just proving
you're the best

259
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,348
(vocalizing )

260
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:59,688
Battle,
you want to win it

261
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:01,772
Let's have a battle

262
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,483
Battle of the bands

263
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,318
Let's have a battle

264
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,314
We'll go all in it

265
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,361
Let's have a battle

266
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,860
Battle, battle

267
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,658
Battle of the bands...

268
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,451
I can beat you.

269
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,790
- Battle...
- Ha! You wish.

270
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,205
- Battle...
- I so want this.

271
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,454
- Battle...
- Not ifl get it first.

272
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:27,172
Me and you,
you and me

273
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,964
Why don't we see
who is better?

274
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:34,385
We don't have to be
one and the same thing

275
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:39,261
Oh, what's so wrong
with a little competition?

276
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:43,640
I'm going out there,
winning the audition

277
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,357
Battle

278
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,647
We want to win it

279
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,816
Let's have a battle

280
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,486
Battle of the bands

281
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,984
Let's have a battle

282
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,202
We'll go all in it

283
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,197
Let's have a battle

284
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,745
Battle, battle

285
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:04,460
Battle of the bands.

286
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:11,297
Oh, they're
that kind of off.

287
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:18,387
Those three are definitely
in possession

288
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,884
of some kind
of dark magic.

289
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,353
How else could you explain
what happened back there?

290
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,474
Don't worry, y'all. We let Principal
Celestia know all about this

291
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,817
and those girls will be kicked
to the curb in no time.

292
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,982
Last thing she needs
is another CHS event

293
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,573
almost ruined by some
power-crazed lunatic.

294
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,033
Uh, no offense.

295
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,243
(sighs)
None taken.

296
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,541
Dark magic?

297
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,251
I find that
very hard to believe.

298
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,121
Those girls came into
my office earlier

299
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,122
and were
absolutely delightful.

300
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,340
Perhaps Sunset Shimmer

301
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,927
is just eager to make someone
else out to be a bad element

302
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:58,264
so that her actions at the Fall Formal
will become old news.

303
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,383
I could see why
you might think that, but--

304
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,055
That's not what's happening.

305
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:04,929
We saw all of this go down
in the cafeteria, too.

306
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,352
Yes, but isn't your band

307
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,477
supposed to be part of
the musical showcase?

308
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,773
Yes.

309
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,646
Perhaps you're all
just worried

310
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,489
that the Dazzlings
will steal your spotlight.

311
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,483
The Dazzlings?

312
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,485
It's the name
of their musical group.

313
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,362
That's why they came by
my office earlier.

314
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:22,830
To sign up for the showcase.

315
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:26,247
Even sang a little song
to Vice Principal Luna and I.

316
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,995
- They did?
- Yes.

317
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,043
And we think having
a battle of the bands

318
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,837
instead is
a marvelous idea.

319
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,806
I can't believe they got
to Principal Celestia

320
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,803
and Vice Principal Luna, too.

321
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,396
They've gotten
to everybody.

322
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,733
- Not everybody.
- Pinkie Pie's right.

323
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,523
We were there when
the Dazzlings were singing

324
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,145
and we weren't affected.

325
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,068
It was like we were
protected somehow.

326
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,986
So let's take them down.

327
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:01,031
It's not like we haven't tangled
with dark magic before

328
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,655
and totally whupped
its sorry butt.

329
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,872
Uh, no offense.

330
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,334
(sighs)
None taken.

331
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:09,748
Again.

332
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,712
But that was when
Twilight was here.

333
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,048
There may be some kind
of magic inside us,

334
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,133
but it only comes out
when we play music.

335
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,469
I sure don't know
how to use it

336
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:22,307
to "whup anybody's butt."

337
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,801
If only we could get
a message to Twilight.

338
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,802
Maybe she could tell us
how to break the spell

339
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,600
the Dazzlings have cast
on our friends.

340
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,519
Well, that's not gonna happen.

341
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,937
The porta|'s closed.

342
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,480
( screams )

343
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:35,979
And I get the feeling

344
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,731
they don't exactly have
cell phones where she's from.

345
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:42,527
I may have an idea

346
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,904
how we can get in touch
with Princess Twilight.

347
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,506
When I was Princess Ce|estia's
student back in Equestria,

348
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,467
she gave me this.

349
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,588
Even after I abandoned my studies,
I held on to it.

350
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,636
Deep down, I guess I knew
I was making a big mistake

351
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,351
and I still wanted a way
to reach out to her.

352
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,647
Maybe it still works.

353
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,766
Rarity:
That's a book, darling.

354
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,859
What do you mean
maybe still works?

355
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,274
It used to be that
if I wrote something here,

356
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:22,070
it would appear in the pages of a book
back in Princess Ce|estia's library.

357
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,068
I get a message to her,

358
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,821
then she can get a message
to Princess Twilight.

359
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,075
So what are you waiting for?
Get to writing.

360
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,006
Huh.

361
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,047
Been a longtime since
I've written these words.

362
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,138
"Dear Princess Ce|estia."

363
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,174
Excuse me, Princess,

364
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:22,885
where do you want all these
books from Princess Celestia?

365
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:26,302
The library.
Third door on the left.

366
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,141
Even this one that's glowing
and vibrating?

367
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,904
What is it, Twilight?

368
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,945
It looks like a message
to Princess Celestia

369
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,658
from my friends
at Canterlot High.

370
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,324
How is that even possible?

371
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:50,662
I have no idea,

372
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,749
but it sounds like
they need my help.

373
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,996
The way Sunset Shimmer
described them,

374
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,214
I think these new girls
sound an awful lot like

375
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,755
the Sirens.

376
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,844
Not the Sirens!

377
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,181
I don't actually know
what that is.

378
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,723
The Sirens were three beautiful
but dangerous creatures

379
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,892
who had the power to charm
ponies with their music.

380
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,686
But to maintain this power,

381
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,980
they had to feed on the negativity
and distrust of others.

382
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,775
The more of this
negative energy they consumed,

383
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:26,115
the stronger
their voices became

384
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,825
and the farther they could
spread their dark magic.

385
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,536
I don't think I like
this story very much.

386
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,782
Twilight:
If the Sirens had their way,

387
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:36,409
they would have divided
and conquered all of Equestria.

388
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,958
But a certain Star Swirl the Bearded
wasn't having it.

389
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:43,959
Rumor has it he found a way
to banish them to another world.

390
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,178
One where he believed
their magic power would be lost.

391
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:52,387
That world must have been the one
where my Canterlot High friends live.

392
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,557
But Star Swirl must have
sent them there ages ago.

393
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,646
How come they're
just surfacing now?

394
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,891
I don't know,
but if my hunch is right

395
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,518
and it is the Sirens
who have come to Canterlot High,

396
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,396
this spell they've cast
is just the beginning.

397
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,616
My friends need me.
I have to get back to them.

398
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,655
I hate to burst your bubble,
Twilight,

399
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,154
but the connection between
their world and Equestria

400
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,407
will still be totally cut off
for a super long time.

401
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,081
Okay, first of all, if there was bubble
blowing going on,

402
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,794
why wasn't I told about it?

403
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:24,165
And secondly, if the connection
is totally cut off,

404
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,839
how was Sunset Shimmer
able to get a message to Twilight?

405
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:31,715
( gasps )
Pinkie, you're a genius.

406
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,591
Yeah, I get that a lot.

407
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,639
Now about those bubbles.

408
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:52,030
Twilight: ...and the interval between
the two points is defined

409
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,199
as the square root of the sum
of the squares of the separation

410
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,822
between the points along
three spatial dimensions.

411
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,997
- Say what now?
- Duh.

412
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:04,793
She's gonna take the magic
in here and put it in there.

413
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,462
That'l| make the portal open up
so that whenever she wants to,

414
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,301
she can go
from here to there.

415
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,511
There to here.
Here-there.

416
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:15,053
- There to here. Here to there. There--
- We get the idea.

417
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:19,432
Now to see
if it actually works.

418
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,659
All: Ooh.

419
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,769
All: Ahh.

420
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,981
Don't suppose we could
join you this time around?

421
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,565
Better not.

422
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,525
It could make things
pretty confusing if Canterlot High

423
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,021
all of a sudden had
two of all of you.

424
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,023
(all "oh" )

425
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,695
But I still get to go, right?

426
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,865
There isn't another one of me
at Canterlot High.

427
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,488
And you never know when you might
need your trusty assistant.

428
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,584
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes!

429
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,418
We won't be gone long.

430
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:27,755
( overlapping chatter)

431
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,919
And don't forget
to dress well.

432
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,088
Ready, Spike?

433
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:38,591
Ready.

434
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,915
(sighs) I'm starting to think
she's not coming.

435
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,167
All:
Twilight!

436
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:13,463
Ooh. I'm back.

437
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,761
All:
Oh, Twilight.

438
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,765
I've got some bad news
about those new girls.

439
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,641
(all groan)

440
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:35,614
Oh, I do hate that you had
to return at a time of crisis.

441
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,075
We have so much
catching up to do.

442
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:41,820
For starters, a certain blue-haired
guitar player was just asking about you.

443
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,994
Flash Sentry
was asking about me?

444
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:48,710
Ahem.
Isn't that nice?

445
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:52,377
Perhaps you could give us just the
slightest bit of gossip from your world?

446
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,340
She's got
an official title now.

447
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:58,929
( mimics trumpet fanfare)
The Princess of Friendship.

448
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,640
Wow, that's
really impressive.

449
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:04,977
Guess you really were
Princess Ce|estia's prize pupil.

450
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,095
She's even got
her own castle.

451
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,642
A castle?!

452
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,391
You have your own castle?!

453
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,768
Uh, ahem.

454
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,645
Oh, lovely.

455
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:15,987
What's new here?

456
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,277
I mean, besides your school
becoming the target

457
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,867
of dangerous magical creatures
from Equestria.

458
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,658
Yeah,
so that isn't exactly

459
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,032
the only strange thing
that's happened since you left.

460
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,499
( music playing )

461
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,994
...and I'm so glad
that we're better...

462
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,416
Pretty sweet, huh?

463
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,960
It happens to all of us
when we play.

464
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:38,006
Hmm. My crown
was returned to Equestria,

465
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,175
but some of its magic must have
remained here at Canterlot High.

466
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,923
Now that we're
all back together,

467
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,891
we can use that magic
on the Sirens.

468
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,101
Just like when we were able to use it
on Sunset Shimmer

469
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:51,099
when she turned into
that horrifyingly awful winged monster.

470
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,475
No offense.

471
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,852
None taken.

472
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,650
I'm used to it.

473
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,863
They'll never even know
what hit ‘em.

474
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,779
(grunting)

475
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,579
We've got nothing to worry about
now that Twilight's back.

476
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:09,576
Oh, I'm pretty sure I could
find something to worry about.

477
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:11,623
But it won't be the Sirens.

478
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,495
The sooner we do this,
the better.

479
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,748
Any idea where
the Dazzlings might be?

480
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,382
(slurps)
Ahh.

481
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,050
There's a big party tonight
for all the bands

482
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,593
who signed up
to be in the showcase.

483
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:26,592
That would include
the Dazzlings.

484
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,976
Looks like we've got
a party to crash.

485
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,608
( chatter)

486
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,950
(sighs)
I'm gonna get more punch.

487
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:54,833
Twilight?

488
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,081
Oh, bumped into--

489
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,798
always doing...

490
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,792
What are you doing here?

491
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,215
You came back for
the big competition, right?

492
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,134
Something like that.

493
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,758
Not that there's going to be
any real competition.

494
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,057
No one here wants this
as bad as my band does.

495
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,907
( chatter)

496
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,160
Can you excuse me
forjust a minute?

497
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,131
( overlapping conversations )

498
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,132
Adagio:
Oh, no. No one's mingling.

499
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,100
It's like there's some kind
of underlying tension

500
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:53,437
that could bubble
to the surface at any minute.

501
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,975
It's the fruit punch,
isn't it?

502
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,099
I knew I used
too much grape juice.

503
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:59,977
It's not the fruit punch,
it's us.

504
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,446
But the punch is awful, too.

505
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,860
What do you know
about good fruit punch?

506
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,278
More than you.

507
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,492
- Do not.
- Do, too.

508
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,159
This is just
the kickoff party, girls.

509
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,281
Imagine what a tizzy
they'll be in

510
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,784
by the time the battle of
the bands starts.

511
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,833
There isn't going to be
a battle of the bands.

512
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,706
We're gonna make sure
of that.

513
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:25,552
All right, girls,
let's do this.

514
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:32,385
Friendship is magic.

515
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:46,611
Uh, weren't there rainbows
and lasers and stuff last time?

516
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,358
I don't understand.

517
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,905
We're all together again.

518
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,404
Why isn't this working?

519
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,377
You, uh, really
need to go ahead

520
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,587
and do that whole
"magic of friendship" thing now.

521
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:03,207
I'm trying, Spike.

522
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,379
I thought the six of us standing
together against the Sirens

523
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,719
would bring out the magic
we needed to defeat them.

524
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,713
That's what happened before.

525
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,387
Talk about throwing down
the gauntlet.

526
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,932
This group is obviously
serious about winning.

527
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,850
A little cocky,
though, aren't they?

528
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:20,224
Claiming there won't
really be a battle.

529
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:24,524
Seems they think they've already got
this thing all locked up.

530
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:28,990
Not if the great and powerful
Trixie has anything to do with it.

531
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,654
Whatever, Trixie.

532
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,402
We're the best band at CHS.

533
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,280
No. The Crusaders
are gonna win.

534
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,498
( overlapping chatter)

535
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:56,018
Adagio: I think we may have found
what we're looking for.

536
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:59,388
Or rather,
it found us.

537
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,019
Magic.
Don't you see?

538
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,943
Everyone else has fallen
under our spell.

539
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:10,987
But not these girls.

540
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,860
These girls are special.

541
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,866
It doesn't make any sense.

542
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,664
I should have been able
to create the spark

543
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,128
that would help us
break their spell.

544
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,373
That's how it worked before.

545
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:29,126
But to defeat me, you drew magic
from the crown I was wearing.

546
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:32,630
The Sirens‘ magic
comes from their music...

547
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:36,759
so maybe you have to use
the same kind of magic to defeat them.

548
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,681
Or maybe not.

549
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:42,477
- No, I think you're onto something.
- Really?

550
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,601
It's when you play music
that you transform now, right?

551
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,319
Yup. Ears, tails,
the whole shebang.

552
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,155
So maybe the way to use that magic
to defeat the Sirens

553
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,241
is by playing a musical
counterspell.

554
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:56,237
- You mean like a song?
- Uh—huh.

555
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:59,240
And in order to free everyone
who's been exposed to the Sirens spell,

556
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,082
we'll need them all
to hear it.

557
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,826
All: Hmm.

558
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,955
( gasps )
The band competition.

559
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:07,672
That's the next time
we can be certain

560
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,042
everyone will be in the same place
at the same time.

561
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,510
Guess the Rainbooms are
the band to beat.

562
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,504
And I believe,
you, Twilight,

563
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,849
just became the Rainbooms‘
newest member.

564
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:20,059
(giggling)

565
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:24,814
So what do you
want to play?

566
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,104
Triangle?
Sousaphone?

567
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,152
- Theremin?
- ( music playing )

568
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,701
So magical.

569
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,536
I might take
a little too long

570
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,576
to learn how to play
something with these.

571
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,040
I'll just sing.

572
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:44,034
Like as in lead singer?

573
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,537
‘Cause that's
usually my gig.

574
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,208
This being
my band and all.

575
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,957
It's our band.

576
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,879
And of course
as lead singer.

577
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:55,174
She's the one with the magical knowhow
to help us pull this thing off.

578
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,218
Okay, yeah, that's cool.

579
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,057
I'll just use this
as a chance

580
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:02,644
to hone my already insanely
good lead guitar skills.

581
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:04,604
It's only temporary.

582
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,814
And we don't have to win
the battle of the bands.

583
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,901
We just have to perform during
the first round of the competition.

584
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:12,612
So let's get to learning
that musical counterspell.

585
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:15,653
Well, that's just it.
I don't know any.

586
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:17,242
(all sigh)

587
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:20,078
But I'm sure I could
figure out how to write one.

588
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:23,449
Totally. Twilight can write a spell
like it's nobody's business.

589
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,577
That's pretty much how she got to become
a princess in Equestria.

590
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,079
Technically,
I helped finish a spell.

591
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,297
And there was a little more
to it than that, Spike.

592
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,416
Yeah, whatever.

593
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,838
I've got this.

594
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,256
Come on.

595
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,051
Where are you going?

596
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:39,514
Well,
last time we were here,

597
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,429
Spike and I spent the night
in the library.

598
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,142
Are you crazy?

599
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,182
We're besties now.

600
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,146
Slumber party at my house.

601
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:54,321
Status update--
okey dokey, Loki.

602
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:11,625
Hey.
I was about to beat you.

603
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:12,963
I doubt it.

604
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:15,800
So, Twilight, how's that
counterspell coming?

605
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,887
Huh? Oh, uh, good. Great.

606
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,552
Thanks for letting me
use your notebook, Fluttershy.

607
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,971
I really like the song
you wrote for the Rainbooms.

608
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:25,639
Thanks.
(smhs)

609
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,434
Hopefully one day,
we'll get a chance to play it.

610
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:30,523
-( laughing)
- Hey!

611
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,895
Twilight, I think I speak
for all of us when I say

612
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:38,148
I don't know what we would've done
if you hadn't come back to help us.

613
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,490
All: Uh—huh.

614
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,154
(doorbell rings)

615
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:42,994
Pizza's here.

616
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,001
(sighs)

617
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,999
Don't you want any pizza?

618
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:12,057
(snoﬁng)

619
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,178
No, that's not gonna work.

620
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,887
Hey, Twilight.
You're up late.

621
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,727
Just looking over
the counterspell.

622
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,848
We only get one shot at this.
It has to be perfect.

623
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,475
We really are lucky
you're here.

624
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:57,728
That's what everyone
keeps telling me.

625
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:01,152
Who could possibly need
this much whipped cream?

626
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,865
It must be nice
to have everyone

627
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,656
always looking to you
for answers to their problems

628
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:08,621
instead of waiting for you
to cause a problem.

629
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,991
Just because everyone
expects something from you

630
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,913
doesn't mean it's guaranteed
to happen.

631
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,412
But that doesn't stop them
from expecting it.

632
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:16,914
Which only make things harder

633
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,131
because the last thing
you want to do is...

634
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:21,798
Both:
Let everybody down.

635
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,303
( screams )

636
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,642
Boulder was hungry.

637
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:41,150
I still can't get over the fact that
she's related to Pinkie Pie.

638
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:43,615
You and me both.

639
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,280
( yawns )
I better get some sleep.

640
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:47,903
Good luck with
the counterspell.

641
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,404
Not that you'll need it.

642
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,327
This must be nothing
compared to the stuff

643
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,917
you're expected to deal with
as a princess in Equestria.

644
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,537
Sunset Shimmer...

645
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,334
Never mind.
It's not important.

646
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:09,766
No, I have to be able
to do this.

647
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,680
I have to.

648
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,560
- ( music playing )
- Hey, hey, listen

649
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:20,276
We've got a message
for you

650
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,488
We're not all alike

651
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:27,451
But our friendship is true

652
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:30,821
Yeah, we're really different

653
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:34,791
But we still get along

654
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,830
So, hey, he!’

655
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:41,172
Listen to our song

656
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:45,044
You may think you're in control

657
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:48,843
But we're here
to prove you wrong

658
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,388
With the friendship
of our music

659
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:56,058
With the power of our song

660
00:37:56,316 --> 00:38:00,229
Gonna stomp our feet,
clap our hands

661
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:03,149
With our magical friendship

662
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:07,490
Gonna stop your evil plan.

663
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,948
Eh, that sounded
way better

664
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,702
than the last five times
you played it.

665
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,919
- ( chuckles )
- Nope.

666
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,419
I think it's pretty obvious

667
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,508
what's going wrong
with this counterspell.

668
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:30,255
You're turning what should be the chorus
into a five-minute guitar solo?

669
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:32,849
I have to pick up
the slack somehow.

670
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,433
Are you guys even trying?

671
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,893
I'm trying-

672
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,933
It's fine.
I'll be fine.

673
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:39,681
One more time from the top.

674
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:43,943
Or perhaps we could take
a short break--

675
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:46,904
try on some of the wardrobe choices
I put together.

676
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,319
I'm particularly fond
of this one.

677
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,741
Of course we could always go
with something a bit more modern.

678
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,364
We're trying to
save our school here.

679
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:57,911
Enough with the costumes.

680
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,581
You can never have
enough costumes.

681
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,921
She just wants
to make things fun.

682
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,586
Isn't that what being
in a band is supposed to be?

683
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,426
You don't have time
for any of this.

684
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,093
You're supposed to check in at the
battle of the bands in 15 minutes.

685
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,261
- ( all gasp)
- Oh, no!

686
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,350
But-- but it's not ready.

687
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,061
If we play the counterspell
in the first round and it doesn't work,

688
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,600
the Sirens will know
what we're up to

689
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:22,474
and make sure we don't
get a chance to play it again.

690
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,482
Then we'll have to
buy ourselves some time

691
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,946
so you can keep
working on it.

692
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,065
And how do you propose
we do that?

693
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,864
We compete in the battle
of the bands for real.

694
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:37,364
I take over lead vocals again
and we stay alive until the finals.

695
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,115
We unleash
the counterspell then.

696
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,743
You'll have figured it out
by the finals, right?

697
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:43,541
Of course she will.

698
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,084
Twilight Spark|e's never met
a problem she couldn't solve.

699
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,958
— Right, Twilight?
— Right.

700
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,053
Then let's go win us
a battle of the bands.

701
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:04,482
Welcome to the first ever

702
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:06,897
Canterlot High School
battle of the bands.

703
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:09,817
I believe I speak
for everyone when I say

704
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,030
it is by far
the greatest thing

705
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:14,651
we have ever done
here at this school.

706
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,198
( cheering )

707
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:21,659
We are so glad
our three newest students

708
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,660
encouraged us
to turn this event

709
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:25,958
into something exciting.

710
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:28,627
But as this is now
a competition,

711
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:30,876
we can only choose
one winner.

712
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,503
Who is it going to be?

713
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,301
( chatter)

714
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,519
You feel that, girls?

715
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:49,064
Our true power
is being restored.

716
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:50,687
(laughing)

717
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:55,904
Adagio:
And that's before

718
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:58,403
we've tapped into
the strongest magic here.

719
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:01,532
But the Rainb|ossoms--
or whatever they're called--

720
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,499
aren't under our spell.

721
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:06,620
How exactly are we supposed
to get to their magic?

722
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,837
The Rainbooms
are just as capable

723
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,003
of falling apart
as anyone else.

724
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,673
They just need a little push
in the wrong direction.

725
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:17,013
I have a feeling
everyone here

726
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:20,053
is going to be lining up
to give them a shove.

727
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,852
( beatboxing )

728
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:30,519
Oh, yeah. Snips and Snails
in the house, yo.

729
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,317
They call me M. C. Ships
and it ain't no lie

730
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,656
My favorite food
is like pumpkin pie

731
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,196
I 'm D.J. Snazzy Snails,
I like whales

732
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,740
When I go to the beach,
I always bring my pail

733
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:43,115
( beatboxing )

734
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,492
Everybody knows
my favorite color is orange

735
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,620
My rhymes are so fly,
they're better than, um...

736
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,246
Than an orange, yo

737
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,419
- Yeah, represent
- Yeah

738
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,963
( beatboxing )

739
00:41:58,016 --> 00:41:59,426
What do we--
what do we do now?

740
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,424
Get off the stage,
I'd like to leave right now.

741
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,677
( beatboxing )

742
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:06,062
Bam. That just happened.

743
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:09,182
- Yeah, we out.
- Snip and Snails outta here.

744
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,851
( feedback )

745
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,813
Please do not
drop the microphones.

746
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,316
- Yeah.
- Bam.

747
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:22,070
In your face, Rainbooms.

748
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,286
At least we know one group

749
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,748
who won't stand in the way
of us getting to the finals.

750
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:27,617
Let's get ready to rock.

751
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,244
Wait,
where's Rarity?

752
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:33,043
Ooh, here. I'm here.
( panting )

753
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,223
We will be performing
in front of an audience.

754
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:46,220
I'm not going to wear
something fabulous? Hmm.

755
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:48,392
( groans)

756
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,690
( chatter)

757
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:56,479
Remember, we have to be
good enough to make it through,

758
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:59,653
but not so good we let the Sirens
see the magic within us.

759
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,947
They could realize we plan
to use it against them.

760
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:04,116
Got it.
Be cool enough to win,

761
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,409
but not so cool
that we end up showing off

762
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,623
the whole ears and tails
and rainbows thing.

763
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:12,370
So about 20% less cool.

764
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:15,465
- One, two.
- We just got the day

765
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,458
To get ready

766
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,382
And there's only
so much time to lose

767
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,258
Because tonight, yeah,
we're here to party

768
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:27,181
So let's think of
something fun to do

769
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,973
We don't know
what's gonna happen

770
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:35,443
We just know
it's gonna feel right

771
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,027
All our friends are here

772
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:41,945
And it's time
to ignite the lights

773
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:45,821
Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight

774
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:48,619
Shake your tail,
shake your tail

775
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:52,789
Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight

776
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,584
Shake your tail,
shake your tail...

777
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:58,083
So what you didn't get it
right the first time?

778
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:59,379
Boﬁng.

779
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,379
Laugh it off,
no one said it is a crime

780
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,178
Do your thing,
you know you're an original

781
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:09,347
Your ideas are so funny
that they're criminal

782
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:12,096
- Ohh, ahh
- ( coughing )

783
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:15,646
We've just got the day
to get ready

784
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:18,565
And there's only
so much time to lose

785
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:22,315
Because tonight, yeah,
we're here to party

786
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:23,942
So let's think of
something fun to do

787
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:26,785
- ( chuckling)
- Awesome.

788
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,370
We don't know

789
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,285
What's gonna happen

790
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:33,660
We just know
it's gonna feel right

791
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,457
All our friends are here

792
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:40,209
And it's time
to ignite the lights

793
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:44,007
Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight

794
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:47,177
Shake your tail,
shake your tail

795
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:50,848
Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight

796
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,812
Shake your tail,
shake your tail

797
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:57,229
Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight

798
00:44:57,486 --> 00:45:01,024
- Shake your tail, shake your tail
- (gasps)

799
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:04,194
Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight

800
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:07,364
Shake your tail,
shake your tail

801
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:10,614
Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight.

802
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:12,536
(crying)

803
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,749
(applause)

804
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:19,121
Ruined.

805
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,089
Absolutely ruined.

806
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:24,086
Rarity, were you trying
to make us lose out there?

807
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:26,133
What--
this was not my fault.

808
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,597
This was an act of sabotage.

809
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:31,012
Yeah, well, whoever did this
couldn't have done this

810
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:34,603
if you didn't insist
on dressing |ike-- like this.

811
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:36,222
We need to sound good.

812
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:38,975
Is there some reason
that concept seems to escape you?

813
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:42,104
And what was
with the confetti, Pinkie Pie?

814
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:45,357
How am I supposed to shred
if there's paper stuck in my frets?

815
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:48,109
- It was pretty distracting.
- Ah!

816
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:50,828
Says the girl who was running
from a light the whole time.

817
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:52,197
A light!

818
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,073
You still sounded
much better

819
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:55,575
than most
of the other bands.

820
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,372
I'm sure you'll make it
to the next round.

821
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:01,623
But it won't matter if you don't
have that counterspell ready.

822
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:04,500
You all find a place to practice
where the Sirens can't hear you,

823
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,003
I'll keep an eye on things
around here.

824
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:17,270
I don't think we should
use a classroom.

825
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:24,275
We really need to stop bumping
into each other like this.

826
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,110
Uh, you guys
hear something?

827
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:28,699
- Uh-uh.
- Uh, no.

828
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:31,410
I said we have to stop--

829
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:33,950
There it is again.
So annoying.

830
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,039
Why are you
acting like this?

831
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:37,830
I thought
we were friends.

832
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:40,123
Yeah, and then you decide
to come back here

833
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:42,167
just so you can beat me
in the battle of the bands.

834
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:45,007
I want this, Twilight,
and you're trying to take it from me.

835
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:47,047
Some friend.

836
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:48,294
That's not why--

837
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:49,966
Come on, Twilight.
We've got things to do.

838
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,805
You really think
you're gonna help them?

839
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,516
I bet you have no idea
what you're even doing.

840
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,730
( snickers )
Tears already?

841
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:02,850
This is only
the first round.

842
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:05,899
(laughing)

843
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:07,818
Principal Celestia:
The next band to take the stage

844
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,191
will be Trixie
and the Illusions.

845
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:14,196
Better head back.
We're supposed to go on after Trixie.

846
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,164
You're never gonna
get away with this.

847
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:23,538
Why, because you didn't?

848
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:28,467
Oh, we know all about you,
Sunset Shimmer.

849
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:31,007
You've got quite
the reputation at Canterlot High.

850
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,677
I've changed.
I'm in a much better place now.

851
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,676
Waiting in the wings
while your friends have all the fun?

852
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:40,020
Oh, yes,
you girls are so tight.

853
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:43,357
And yet they didn't ask you
to be in the band?

854
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:46,023
Probably afraid no one
would want to see them play

855
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,191
if she was
in the group.

856
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:49,529
Too bad.

857
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:50,990
So sad.

858
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:52,653
Adagio:
If it's any consolation,

859
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:55,119
no one is going to
remember you at all

860
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:57,159
by the time
we're done.

861
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:08,048
Remember, girls,
we want to save the good stuff

862
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,793
for when our full power
has been restored.

863
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:15,548
- ( music playing )
- Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

864
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,721
You didn't know
that you fell

865
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:20,094
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

866
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:22,267
Now that you're
under our spell

867
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:24,937
Blindsided by the beat

868
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:27,185
Clapping your hands,
stomping your feet

869
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:29,402
You didn't know
that you fell

870
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:31,443
Oh

871
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,066
Now you've fallen
under our spell

872
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,410
Oh

873
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:39,076
We've got the music,
makes you move it

874
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,289
Got the song
that makes you lose it

875
00:48:41,544 --> 00:48:43,751
We say, "Jump,"
you say, "How high?"

876
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,869
Put your hands up
to the sky

877
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:48,168
We've got the music,
makes you move it

878
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:50,587
Got the song
that makes you lose it

879
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:52,927
We say, "Jump,"
you say, "How high?"

880
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,091
Put your hands up
to the sky

881
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,089
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

882
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:59,467
You didn't know
that you fell

883
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,639
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

884
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,933
Now that you're
under our spell

885
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,398
Listen to the sound
of my voice

886
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:08,233
Oh

887
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:11,149
Soon you'll find
you don't have a choice

888
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:12,897
Oh

889
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:15,775
Captured in the web
of my song

890
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:17,401
Oh

891
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:20,700
Soon you'll all
be singing along

892
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,198
Oh

893
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,042
We've got the music,
makes you move it

894
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:27,332
Got the song
that makes you lose it

895
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,706
We say, "Jump,"
you say, "How high?"

896
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,958
Put your hands up
to the sky

897
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,426
We've got the music,
makes you move it

898
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,671
Got the song
that makes you lose it

899
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,888
We say, "Jump,"
you say, "How high?"

900
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:41,259
Put your hands up
to the sky

901
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,101
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

902
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,471
You didn't know
that you fell

903
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:47,644
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

904
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:50,109
Now that you're
under our spell

905
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:52,478
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

906
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,947
You didn't know
that you fell

907
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:56,987
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

908
00:49:57,244 --> 00:50:00,486
Now that you're
under our spell.

909
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:02,659
( cackling )

910
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:17,507
This is it, last round
and you're in the finals.

911
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:21,053
Unless you think the counterspell
is ready to be played now.

912
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:25,185
Don't worry, Twilight,
finals aren't until tonight.

913
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:26,599
We'll get in a little
more practice

914
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,222
before we're
supposed to hit the stage.

915
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:30,896
- We won't let you down.
- All: Yeah.

916
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,610
You won't let me down.

917
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:36,230
F|uttershy:
Um, I was just wondering,

918
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:39,575
we haven't played any
of my songs yet and--

919
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:40,943
It's the semifinals.

920
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:42,445
We've gotta do
"Awesome as I Wanna Be."

921
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:45,448
I don't know why I even asked.

922
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,370
got tricks
up my sleeve

923
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:53,589
See me dominate 'cause
I'm powerful and great.

924
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:58,427
Oh! Fantastic.

925
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:04,975
You're never gonna top
that performance, "Raingoons."

926
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:06,560
You shouldn't
be allowed to

927
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:09,430
when you have such
a big advantage over the rest of us.

928
00:51:09,692 --> 00:51:11,478
My superior guitar playing

929
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,771
and off-the-charts
awesome singing voice?

930
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,815
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

931
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,529
I mean her.

932
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:20,490
If you were really all that,
Rainbow Dash,

933
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,235
you wouldn't have needed
to bring in some magical ringer

934
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:24,703
to have half a chance.

935
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:26,663
Everyone's talking about it.

936
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,453
Ha! Please.

937
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:30,326
I could win this thing
as a solo act

938
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:33,125
and everybody knows it.

939
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:34,838
Sure, you could.

940
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:38,751
(coughing)

941
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:42,547
She's gone!

942
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:44,844
Oh, wait.
There she is.

943
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,719
Principal Celestia:
Next up, the Rainbooms.

944
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,895
- Knock ‘em dead, Rainbooms.
- I'll be here.

945
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:56,860
Just watching.

946
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:05,365
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
- Awesome as I wanna be

947
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:09,582
Hey, hey: hey’
hey, hey, he!’

948
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,200
Awesome as I wanna be

949
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:13,874
First you see me
riding on a sonic boom

950
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,543
Got my guitar
shredding up my latest tune

951
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,132
There is nothing
you can do to beat me

952
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,843
I'm so good
that you can't defeat me

953
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,713
Yeah, I'm awesome,
take caution

954
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,557
Watch out for me,
I'm awesome as I wanna be

955
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,348
Yeah, I'm awesome,
take caution

956
00:52:30,606 --> 00:52:33,143
Watch out for me,
I'm as awesome as I wanna be

957
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,689
Hey, hey: hey’
hey, hey, he!’

958
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:42,485
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey.

959
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,415
( screams )

960
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:03,627
Now that's the bad girl
we love to hate.

961
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:06,346
- ( cheering )
- I knew she was still trouble.

962
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,342
Boy:
The real Sunset Shimmer is back.

963
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,685
No, it isn't like that.

964
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:18,358
What was that?

965
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:19,977
You were showing them
your magic.

966
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:21,775
I didn't know
what else to do.

967
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,444
Close the curtains.
Unplug her amp.

968
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:26,317
Give us a chance to deal
with the situation.

969
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:28,534
I'm sorry.
Ijust wanted to help.

970
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:30,370
Yeah, well, you didn't.

971
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:33,457
None of this would've happened
if you weren't trying to show off.

972
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:34,871
As usual.

973
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:37,336
Good show, "Rainbrooms."

974
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:39,921
I especially like the part
where Sunset Shimmer,

975
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,790
in a fit ofjealous rage,

976
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:45,260
knocked out Rainbow Dash
mid guitar solo.

977
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:47,721
It wasn't a fit
ofjealous rage.

978
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,263
If you say so.

979
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:55,308
Ooh, looks like
they've already decided

980
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:57,102
who'll be moving on
to the finals.

981
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,442
I'm guessing it wasn't
too difficult a decision.

982
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,569
(vocalizing )

983
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:10,320
- Huh?
- Rarity: What can we do?

984
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:12,913
There isn't gonna be another
opportunity for us to play.

985
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:16,659
And I had the most gorgeous
outfit for the finals.

986
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,753
Yup, 'cause that's
he real tragedy here, Rarity.

987
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:21,497
That you won't
get to play dress-up.

988
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:23,750
You know perfectly well
that is not what I meant.

989
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:25,751
You guys wanna
keep it down?

990
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:27,128
They're about to
announce who's moving on.

991
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:28,378
Who are you kidding?

992
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,596
You know it isn't
gonna be us.

993
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:37,054
The band that will be joining
the Dazzlings in tonight's finals...

994
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:39,181
the Rainbooms.

995
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:40,899
-What?!
—All: Huh?

996
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:43,235
Did they just say
"The Rainbooms"?

997
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,488
This isn't over.

998
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:50,491
Congratulations, girls.

999
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:52,486
You deserve it.

1000
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:55,160
Seriously?
We didn't even finish our--

1001
00:54:57,336 --> 00:55:00,328
See you at tonight's
big show, Rainbooms.

1002
00:55:00,589 --> 00:55:03,797
We are really
looking forward to it.

1003
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:06,383
Yeah, well,
not as much as we are.

1004
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:08,628
( crowd booing, jeering )

1005
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:11,255
This never should have been you,
Rainbooms.

1006
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:25,477
This is a travesty.

1007
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,479
A travesty!

1008
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:29,072
It really is.

1009
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,567
The Rainbooms don't deserve
to be in the finals.

1010
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:34,662
Not when your band
was so much better in the semis.

1011
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:36,997
And wanted it
so much more.

1012
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:39,412
Alas, this is the way
it's going to be.

1013
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,752
Dazzlings
versus Rainbooms.

1014
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:44,246
Unless, of course, the Rainbooms
don't manage to make it to their set

1015
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:46,499
were held up
for some reason.

1016
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,625
Hmm?
('a“9hing)

1017
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:59,470
Check one, two.
Testing. Testing.

1018
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:05,142
- Testing.
- ( feedback )

1019
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,613
This doesn't
make any sense.

1020
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:12,199
We were awful.

1021
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:14,488
Doesn't anybody else
think it's strange

1022
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,953
that we're the ones
that made it to the finals?

1023
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,994
Very strange.

1024
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:21,992
What are you doing here,
Trixie?

1025
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:25,087
Pretty sure the losers are supposed
to be up there in the cheap seats.

1026
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,501
The great and powerful Trixie

1027
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:30,125
is the most talented girl
at Canterlot High.

1028
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:33,003
It is I who deserve to be
in the finals.

1029
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:35,677
And I will not be denied.

1030
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:38,676
(all scream )

1031
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:48,526
( cackling )

1032
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,648
See you never.

1033
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:01,414
Told you someone
would give them a shove.

1034
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,829
She didn't shove them,
she pulled the lever.

1035
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,703
Oh, go back to sleep,
Sonata.

1036
00:57:08,634 --> 00:57:12,218
You better believe
I've got tricks up my sleeve

1037
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:16,430
And I captivate 'cause
I'm powerful and great

1038
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:22,561
You'd better believe
I've got tricks up my sleeve

1039
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:27,808
See me dominate 'cause
I'm powerful and great...

1040
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:35,403
App|ejack:
Give it up, Rainbow Dash.

1041
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:38,949
You've been trying at this for hours.
It's not gonna open.

1042
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,365
Maybe it doesn't even matter
that we're trapped down here.

1043
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:45,834
I don't think the counterspell
would've worked anyway.

1044
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:47,703
‘Course it would've worked,
Twilight.

1045
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:50,707
Assuming a certain band member
didn't try to hog the spotlight

1046
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:52,333
the whole time
we were trying to play it.

1047
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,550
Hey, if you want
to tell Twilight

1048
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:56,045
she's getting
a little too caught up

1049
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,762
trying to be the new leader of this
band,

1050
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:00,132
you don't have to be
all cryptic about it.

1051
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:04,137
She was talking about you,
Rainbow Dash.

1052
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:05,478
Me?!

1053
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,222
I'm just trying
to make sure my band

1054
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,190
rocks as hard
as it needs to.

1055
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,309
All:
Our band!

1056
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:13,186
But why wasn't it working?

1057
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:14,688
I should know what to do.

1058
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,486
How can I not know
what to do?

1059
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:18,404
How could I
have failed like this?

1060
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:20,903
It might've been your idea
to start a band,

1061
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,655
but it's not just your band,
Rainbow Dash.

1062
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,782
I'm the one who writes
all the songs.

1063
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:29,207
I write songs.
You just never let us play any of them.

1064
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:32,080
I had the most perfect
outfits for us to wear.

1065
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,003
Again with the costumes.

1066
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:35,751
No one cares
what we're wearing.

1067
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:37,549
I care, Applejack.

1068
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:41,094
So sorry if I enjoy trying to make
a creative contribution to the band.

1069
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,717
Hey, anybody here
remember fun?!

1070
00:58:43,979 --> 00:58:45,264
I'll give you a hint--

1071
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:48,685
it's the exact opposite
of being in the Rainbooms!

1072
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,684
I wish I never asked
any of you to be in my band.

1073
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:56,314
- I wish I never agreed to be in it!
- Both: Me neither.

1074
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:58,531
(overlapping yelling )

1075
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:11,286
Yeah, yeah

1076
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:15,291
Better believe
I've got tricks up my sleeve

1077
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:21,513
See me dominate 'cause
I'm powerful and great.

1078
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:25,842
( crowd cheering )

1079
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,020
Try to top that.

1080
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:36,270
Oh, gosh,
I don't know if we can.

1081
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:38,863
( laughs)

1082
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,991
( music playing )

1083
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,633
(vocalizing )

1084
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:17,443
(overlapping yelling
conﬁnues)

1085
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:22,156
Stop!
You have to stop!

1086
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:24,651
This is what
they've been after all along.

1087
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:27,404
They're feeding off
of the magic inside you.

1088
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:29,657
How can they
be using our magic?

1089
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:31,328
It's the magic
of friendship.

1090
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:35,086
Ever since you started
this band,

1091
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,205
you've been letting
little things get to you.

1092
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,379
I never said anything 'cause
I didn't feel like it was my place.

1093
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:44,050
Not when I was so new to this
whole friendship thing.

1094
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:46,343
I still have a lot to learn.

1095
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:48,387
But I do know that
if you don't work out

1096
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,886
even the smallest problems
right at the start,

1097
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:54,231
the magic of friendship
can be turned into something else.

1098
01:00:55,944 --> 01:00:57,809
I can't believe
all this tension was happening

1099
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:00,062
right under my nose
and I didn't realize it.

1100
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,314
I'm supposed to be the one
with all the answers.

1101
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:06,239
And all I've done
since I got here is let you down.

1102
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:10,496
I don't think anyone
is supposed to have all the answers.

1103
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:14,083
But you can count
on your friends to help you find them.

1104
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:17,624
I think you already have.

1105
01:01:17,883 --> 01:01:19,965
Come on, we need to
get out of here.

1106
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,585
(all grunting)

1107
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:25,712
( knocks )

1108
01:01:25,974 --> 01:01:27,180
Spike!

1109
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:31,267
Sorry I took so long.

1110
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:32,931
I had to find somebody who wasn't
under the Sirens‘ spell

1111
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:34,350
to help me get you out.

1112
01:01:36,151 --> 01:01:38,233
Why isn't she
under their spell?

1113
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:39,771
Never takes off
herheadphones.

1114
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:42,813
Come on, y'all.

1115
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:45,235
Time to prove we've still got the magic
of friendship inside us.

1116
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:47,233
And there's only
one way to do it.

1117
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:49,110
We're getting the band
back together?

1118
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:51,203
We're getting
our band back together.

1119
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:54,165
- Whee!
- Oh, which version of the counterspell

1120
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:55,534
are we going to play?

1121
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:57,831
I don't think it matters
what song we play

1122
01:01:58,089 --> 01:02:01,206
as long as we play it
together as friends.

1123
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:02,583
I know just the song.

1124
01:02:04,179 --> 01:02:06,170
F|uttershy's written
a really great one.

1125
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:09,381
We're about to
save the world here.

1126
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:12,555
Personally,
I think we should do it in style.

1127
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:15,599
- Rarity?
- I thought you'd never ask.

1128
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:19,481
(vocalizing )

1129
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:31,411
Welcome to the show

1130
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:36,409
We're here
to let you know

1131
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:40,709
Our time is now

1132
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:43,924
Your time is running out

1133
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:46,133
(vocalizing )

1134
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:52,014
How are we supposed
to play over them from up here?

1135
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:53,429
( horn honks)

1136
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:56,594
(honks)

1137
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,895
( cheering )

1138
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:07,693
Feel the wave of sound

1139
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:10,317
As it crashes down

1140
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,569
You can't turn away

1141
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:15,413
We'll make you wanna stay

1142
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:18,374
We will be adored

1143
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:20,539
Tell us that you want us

1144
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:23,413
We won't be ignored

1145
01:03:23,675 --> 01:03:25,666
It's time for our reward

1146
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:28,009
Now you need us

1147
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:30,675
Come and meet us

1148
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:35,676
Nothing can stop us now

1149
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:38,553
- ( music playing )
- Oh, whoa

1150
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,976
I've got the music in me

1151
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:43,395
Oh, whoa

1152
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,813
Don't need
to hear a crowd

1153
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:50,781
Cheering out my name

1154
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:55,029
I didn't come here
seeking infamy or fame

1155
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:57,702
The one and only thing

1156
01:03:57,959 --> 01:03:59,574
That I am here to bring

1157
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,576
Is music,
is the music

1158
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:04,045
Is the music
in my soul

1159
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:05,505
Gonna break out

1160
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:09,001
Set myself free, yeah

1161
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:10,877
Let it all go, go

1162
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:13,505
Just let it be, yeah

1163
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:16,133
Find the music
in your heart

1164
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:18,385
Let the music
make you start

1165
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:23,060
To set yourself apart

1166
01:04:23,318 --> 01:04:27,061
So the Rainbooms want to turn this
into a real battle of the bands?

1167
01:04:27,322 --> 01:04:28,937
Then let's battle.

1168
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,030
What we have in store

1169
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:33,741
All we want and more

1170
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:35,951
We will break on through

1171
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:39,289
Now it's time
to finish you

1172
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:20,613
Oh, oh...

1173
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,826
(vocalizing )

1174
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:57,905
Sunset Shimmer,
we need you.

1175
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:09,078
( music playing )

1176
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:14,258
You're never gonna
bring me down

1177
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:17,754
You're never gonna
break this part of me

1178
01:06:18,016 --> 01:06:21,474
My friends are here
to bring me around

1179
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:25,141
Not just singing
for popularity

1180
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:27,263
We're here
to let you know

1181
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:28,935
That we won't let it go

1182
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:32,061
Our music is a bomb
and it's about to blow

1183
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:33,983
And you can try to fight

1184
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:38,779
But we have got the light
of friendship on our side

1185
01:06:39,037 --> 01:06:41,824
Got the music
in our hearts

1186
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:45,414
We're here to blow
this thing apart

1187
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:49,411
And together,
we will never

1188
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:52,755
Be afraid of the dark

1189
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:56,376
Here to sing our song
out loud

1190
01:06:56,638 --> 01:06:59,801
Get you dancing
with the crowd

1191
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:05,303
As the music
of our friendship survives

1192
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:07,099
Survives

1193
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:10,315
Got the music
in our hearts

1194
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:13,935
We're here to blow
this thing apart

1195
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:17,610
And together,
we will never

1196
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:21,155
Be afraid of the dark

1197
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:24,745
Here to sing our song
out loud

1198
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:28,116
Get you dancing
with the crowd

1199
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:33,418
As the music
of our friendship survives

1200
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:39,215
Survives, survives

1201
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:01,650
(singing off-key )
We will be adored

1202
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,651
Tell us that you want us

1203
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:06,074
We won't be ignored

1204
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:09,950
- ( booing )
- It's time for our reward...

1205
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:18,337
Guess that explains why these were
so special to them.

1206
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:21,678
Without those pendants and the magic
you brought here from Equestria,

1207
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:24,263
they're just three
harmless teenage girls.

1208
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:28,055
Rainbooms rule!
That was amazing.

1209
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,808
(giggling)

1210
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:37,735
You may have vanquished
the Dazzlings,

1211
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:41,197
but you will never have the amazing
showstopping ability

1212
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:44,067
of the great
and powerful Trixie.

1213
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:47,324
(coughing)

1214
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,990
She's gone!

1215
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:54,501
Oh, wait.
There she is.

1216
01:08:56,174 --> 01:08:59,086
( groans )
Trixie's okay.

1217
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:02,177
You know, Twilight is going back
to Equestria soon.

1218
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:03,840
The Rainbooms
could really use

1219
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:06,760
someone to help Fluttershy
on backup vocals.

1220
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:14,264
I also play guitar.

1221
01:09:18,363 --> 01:09:19,819
We'll see.

1222
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:31,580
Sure wish
you could stay longer.

1223
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:34,416
Me, too, but I have
responsibilities

1224
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:36,502
in Equestria
that I have to get back to.

1225
01:09:36,756 --> 01:09:39,668
Its citizens need me.

1226
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:43,009
But now I can go through the portal
whenever I need to.

1227
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:46,880
This isn't good-bye,
it's just good-bye till next time.

1228
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:49,803
- Ready?
- Ready.

1229
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:04,276
"Dear
Princess Twilight,

1230
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:07,947
missing you already
and hope you'll be back soon.

1231
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:11,446
Things are definitely looking up
for me here at Canterlot High,

1232
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:15,371
but I know I still have a lot
to learn about friendship.

1233
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:18,540
Hope you don't mind if I write to you
for advice when I need it.

1234
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:21,414
Your friend,
Sunset Shimmer."

1235
01:10:21,676 --> 01:10:24,509
- You ready or what?
- Ready.

1236
01:10:26,139 --> 01:10:27,925
One, two, three, four.

1237
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:30,138
( music playing )

1238
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:39,983
Once upon a time

1239
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:44,320
You came into my world
and made the stars align

1240
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:48,950
Now I can see the signs

1241
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:53,037
You pick me up
when I get down so I can shine

1242
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:57,250
Shine like rainbows

1243
01:10:57,503 --> 01:11:02,668
Shine
like rainbows

1244
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:06,338
Friends,
you are in my life

1245
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:11,431
And you can count on me
to be there by your side

1246
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:15,142
And when the music
comes alive

1247
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:19,514
We sing our songs to
lift us up so we can shine

1248
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:23,268
And the sound
that we hear in our hearts

1249
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:28,068
Makes a crescendo

1250
01:11:28,326 --> 01:11:31,864
And the light that ignites
in the dark

1251
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:36,364
It makes us all glow

1252
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:40,710
And shine like rainbows

1253
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:46,208
We shine like rainbows

1254
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:50,087
Together we stand

1255
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:56,093
As the rain
begins to fall

1256
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:59,061
And holding
our heads up high

1257
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:03,183
As the sun shines
through it all

1258
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:07,278
And the sound
that we hear in our hearts

1259
01:12:07,532 --> 01:12:12,071
Makes a crescendo

1260
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:15,411
And the light
that ignites in the dark

1261
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:20,625
It makes us all glow

1262
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:24,746
And shine like rainbows

1263
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:29,171
We shine like rainbows

1264
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:33,421
Shine like rainbows

1265
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:37,926
We shine like rainbows

1266
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:42,396
Shine like rainbows.

1267
01:13:06,007 --> 01:13:08,168
No doubt about it, Spike.

1268
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:11,668
There's definitely something strange
going on at that school.
