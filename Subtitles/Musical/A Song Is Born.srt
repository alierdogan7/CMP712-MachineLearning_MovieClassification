1
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,438
<i>First you take a drum beat</i>

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,134
<i>And then you add a clarinet</i>

3
00:00:12,844 --> 00:00:16,109
<i>You sweeten with a trombone</i>

4
00:00:17,014 --> 00:00:20,142
<i>Then let the other cats get set</i>

5
00:00:22,052 --> 00:00:26,148
<i>Season with a sprinkling
of Gabriel's horn</i>

6
00:00:26,222 --> 00:00:27,348
<i>And presto</i>

7
00:00:28,224 --> 00:00:34,424
<i>A song is born</i>

8
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,584
They're here! They're here.
They just drove up.

9
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,786
Who is here?

10
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:18,261
You know, whatchamacallit,
the lawyer for the foundation.

11
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,490
And Miss Totten is with him.

12
00:02:19,565 --> 00:02:21,430
I saw them getting out of the car.

13
00:02:21,532 --> 00:02:23,329
And this place is
looking like a flicker's nest.

14
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:25,699
We're in for our semiannual wigging,
I suppose.

15
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,260
You'd better put your coat on, Frisbee.

16
00:02:27,337 --> 00:02:28,827
Yeah, and fix your tie, too.
Fix your tie.

17
00:02:28,905 --> 00:02:30,634
Come here.
Let me fix your hair a little bit.

18
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,437
- It looks so untidy.
- Straighten him up. That's it.

19
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,841
What is all this nonsense?

20
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:35,606
This nonsense is Miss Totten.

21
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,705
And will you please smile at her?

22
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:39,271
Gentlemen, this is very undignified.

23
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:41,146
If you think you're being funny, I...

24
00:02:41,218 --> 00:02:43,243
Good morning, gentlemen.

25
00:02:44,856 --> 00:02:47,518
- Good morning, Miss Totten.
- Good morning, Miss Totten.

26
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:50,082
- Won't you sit here, please?
- It's a very nice day, Miss Totten.

27
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:51,854
Would you like to speak,
Miss Totten, or shall I?

28
00:02:51,927 --> 00:02:55,363
- No, you go ahead, Mr. Setter.
- I will be brief as possible.

29
00:02:55,432 --> 00:02:58,595
Gentlemen, to date,
$283,000 have been expended

30
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:01,602
on the writing of this history of music.

31
00:03:01,671 --> 00:03:03,502
I hope you realize that
Miss Totten's father,

32
00:03:03,573 --> 00:03:05,598
the late Daniel S. Totten,

33
00:03:06,475 --> 00:03:09,376
left only a quarter of a million dollars
for this project.

34
00:03:09,445 --> 00:03:12,903
Every additional penny has to
come from Miss Totten's pocket.

35
00:03:12,981 --> 00:03:14,448
You've been at it for 10 years now.

36
00:03:14,516 --> 00:03:17,144
- Nine.
- All right, nine.

37
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:19,744
I want your frank estimate
of how much longer you will take.

38
00:03:19,822 --> 00:03:21,016
- Well...
- Maybe three years.

39
00:03:21,089 --> 00:03:22,215
- Maybe four.
- Yes.

40
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,689
It cannot be. It just cannot be.

41
00:03:23,758 --> 00:03:24,952
Oh, my dear Miss Totten.

42
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:27,118
Surely, you don't want to discontinue
your father's great gesture

43
00:03:27,195 --> 00:03:28,628
towards human enlightenment, do you?

44
00:03:28,695 --> 00:03:30,754
Human enlightenment?
Nonsense, Professor.

45
00:03:30,832 --> 00:03:32,993
My father was a disappointed musician.

46
00:03:33,066 --> 00:03:35,534
He was never able to master
a single instrument.

47
00:03:35,602 --> 00:03:37,661
So he decided to manufacture pianos,

48
00:03:37,738 --> 00:03:40,707
and because his name was not included
with Steinway and Meyer

49
00:03:40,774 --> 00:03:43,106
and Chickering,
he decided to finance this project.

50
00:03:43,177 --> 00:03:44,269
Exactly.

51
00:03:44,343 --> 00:03:46,072
And you'll have to
get it done with, quickly.

52
00:03:46,146 --> 00:03:47,875
- Slap it together.
- What?

53
00:03:47,947 --> 00:03:50,780
Excuse me, Mr. Setter. May I have a word?

54
00:03:51,285 --> 00:03:53,276
Hello, Professor Frisbee.

55
00:03:54,554 --> 00:03:57,785
Hello, Miss Totten.
You said slap it together.

56
00:03:57,856 --> 00:04:00,051
- We're not the slapping together kind.
- He's right.

57
00:04:00,126 --> 00:04:02,151
And this is not
an ordinary encyclopedia of music.

58
00:04:02,228 --> 00:04:04,492
What's different about this
except that it's taking longer?

59
00:04:04,564 --> 00:04:06,964
Don't interrupt, Mr. Setter.

60
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:09,501
In what way is this different,
Professor Frisbee?

61
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:11,730
Well, as far as I know,
this is the first history of music,

62
00:04:11,804 --> 00:04:16,070
which, in addition to its written volumes,
will have albums of recorded music.

63
00:04:16,142 --> 00:04:18,508
Now, in my own field of folk music...

64
00:04:18,578 --> 00:04:21,843
- I'm not interested.
- Don't interrupt, Mr. Setter.

65
00:04:22,247 --> 00:04:23,908
Go on, Professor.

66
00:04:26,817 --> 00:04:31,550
I'm appealing to you, Miss Totten,
to your vision and to your heart.

67
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,650
Perhaps I'm maybe a little inarticulate,

68
00:04:34,726 --> 00:04:37,923
but I've somehow
always regarded you as...

69
00:04:40,297 --> 00:04:42,390
You know what I mean, Miss Totten?

70
00:04:42,465 --> 00:04:46,401
Of course.
Well, it was my father's dying wish,

71
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,631
and you do make such an eloquent plea.

72
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,866
- But all of this seems so useless.
- Exactly.

73
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,671
It's not only useless, dull, unromantic,
but unprofitable.

74
00:04:54,744 --> 00:04:55,870
My dear Mr. Setter,

75
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:57,537
bringing the peoples of the world
closer together

76
00:04:57,614 --> 00:04:59,104
through the universal language of music

77
00:04:59,181 --> 00:05:02,048
can hardly be termed
useless, dull and unromantic.

78
00:05:02,118 --> 00:05:04,484
Our work is anything but that.

79
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,114
- It is often very exciting.
Oh, fiddlesticks.

80
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,420
- Yes, even emotional.
- Really?

81
00:05:09,891 --> 00:05:11,688
Yes, Miss Totten, we...

82
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,924
Only the other day we were recording
a Polynesian chant, love chant.

83
00:05:15,998 --> 00:05:18,432
- West Indian, wasn't it?
- Samoan, I believe.

84
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,489
Get to the point.

85
00:05:19,635 --> 00:05:20,795
The point is, Mr. Setter,

86
00:05:20,869 --> 00:05:23,804
the chant was exciting
and it was emotional.

87
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,233
It concerned itself with
the relation of music to courtship.

88
00:05:27,308 --> 00:05:28,332
Courtship?

89
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:30,343
My dear Frisbee,
if you think that...

90
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,537
Just a minute, Mr. Setter.

91
00:05:32,947 --> 00:05:34,642
I'm very interested, Professor.

92
00:05:34,715 --> 00:05:37,650
Well, perhaps we can demonstrate it
for Miss Totten.

93
00:05:37,718 --> 00:05:39,185
Yes, let's demonstrate it.

94
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,486
I don't think that would be
the logical thing to do.

95
00:05:41,557 --> 00:05:44,321
- That's a very good idea.
- Please, please do.

96
00:05:44,394 --> 00:05:45,622
I'd love to hear it.

97
00:05:45,695 --> 00:05:47,720
Well, all right. Gentlemen, if you please.

98
00:05:47,797 --> 00:05:48,821
- Yes, let's do it.
- All right.

99
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:54,795
Now, Miss Totten, imagine the setting
in an island courtship.

100
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:55,997
There's a vacant hut.

101
00:05:56,072 --> 00:05:58,768
The nuptial hut all bedecked with flowers.

102
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,332
And nearby, the maiden awaits
the arrival of her lover.

103
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:04,176
Oh, excuse me.

104
00:06:04,246 --> 00:06:06,806
Professor Oddly, you will be the maiden.

105
00:06:06,882 --> 00:06:09,578
- But, Professor Frisbee, I...
- Oddly.

106
00:06:11,552 --> 00:06:12,644
Must I, Professor Frisbee?

107
00:06:12,721 --> 00:06:15,485
If you'll just stand over there,
Oddly, please!

108
00:06:15,556 --> 00:06:18,423
Now, Miss Totten, as the lover approaches
from the opposite side of the village,

109
00:06:18,493 --> 00:06:20,586
he is laden down with gifts.

110
00:06:20,662 --> 00:06:24,655
And the beating of the drums
signalizes the beginning of the courtship.

111
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:35,140
As he comes nearer the village,
his relatives take up the drumming.

112
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:42,911
Then he spies the maiden and calls to her,
and she answers.

113
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:47,409
Professor, would you give us
the mating call please?

114
00:06:51,623 --> 00:06:53,215
That's the mating call.

115
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:56,694
Now, imagine I'm coming around
the corner of the hut.

116
00:07:03,268 --> 00:07:05,202
He spies the maiden.

117
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,415
Just... Just one moment, gentlemen.

118
00:07:20,486 --> 00:07:22,818
Oddly, that was quite adequate
for the recording,

119
00:07:22,888 --> 00:07:26,153
but I feel the air of reality
is somewhat strained here.

120
00:07:26,224 --> 00:07:28,454
But, Professor Frisbee,
I didn't want to do it anyway.

121
00:07:28,526 --> 00:07:29,618
I know that, Oddly, but I...

122
00:07:29,694 --> 00:07:31,958
Professor, perhaps I could...

123
00:07:32,028 --> 00:07:35,054
Very well, if you'll just stand here,
Miss Totten.

124
00:07:35,165 --> 00:07:38,396
- And when I give you the mating call...
- Yes?

125
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:41,131
...you give it right back to me.

126
00:07:41,204 --> 00:07:44,901
Now, imagine I'm coming around
the corner of the same hut.

127
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,015
No.

128
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:08,987
Just... May I interrupt just one moment?

129
00:08:09,063 --> 00:08:12,089
I'm afraid, Miss Totten,
you'll have to employ a great deal more

130
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:15,034
abandon both in voice and posture.

131
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:18,539
I neglected to tell you about the posture.

132
00:08:18,604 --> 00:08:22,335
The native position
being somewhat more like this.

133
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:23,899
And it has...

134
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,308
Yes, that's fine, Miss Totten.

135
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:29,680
Now imagine I'm coming around
the corner of the hut.

136
00:08:42,228 --> 00:08:45,493
That's fine, Miss Totten.
That's a considerable improvement.

137
00:08:45,565 --> 00:08:49,194
Now, more abandon, Miss Totten. Yes.

138
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:53,330
Now, as the man hears the maiden,
the beat of the drums intensifies.

139
00:08:53,806 --> 00:08:56,240
Fever of the music
has entered into his blood.

140
00:08:56,309 --> 00:08:59,142
His nostrils are distended
and his eyes are gleamed.

141
00:08:59,211 --> 00:09:01,702
And the singing goes on like this.

142
00:09:06,351 --> 00:09:10,310
I'm sorry, Miss Totten,
I'm merely assuming

143
00:09:10,388 --> 00:09:13,824
the role of the lover
and you the role of the maiden.

144
00:09:14,425 --> 00:09:17,451
This call is the lover's greeting,

145
00:09:17,527 --> 00:09:21,588
and it is accomplished by
the diaphragmatic pressure

146
00:09:21,665 --> 00:09:26,625
so necessary to the primitive
sound in this fashion.

147
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:35,406
Would you try that, Miss Totten, please?

148
00:09:40,318 --> 00:09:42,377
That's very good, Miss Totten.

149
00:09:42,453 --> 00:09:44,512
You seem to have
caught the spirit quite well.

150
00:09:44,588 --> 00:09:47,022
Now, would you try that once with me.

151
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:21,113
That's fine, Miss Totten.

152
00:10:22,057 --> 00:10:23,524
Miss Totten.

153
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:28,458
I don't like to interrupt, Miss Totten, but...

154
00:10:31,866 --> 00:10:34,562
Miss Totten, I don't like to interrupt,

155
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,865
but you've caught the spirit
extremely well, Miss Totten.

156
00:10:36,938 --> 00:10:39,907
Now, from this point on,
the dance just continues

157
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,306
until the lover takes the maiden
in his arms and carries her away,

158
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:46,608
but I don't think there's any point
in demonstrating that.

159
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:49,411
It was wonderful. Simply wonderful.

160
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:53,043
- Miss Totten, I thought you'd decided...
- I liked it. I liked it.

161
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,144
- Yes, Miss Totten?
- Professor, the work at the foundation

162
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:56,849
must continue. I'll see to that.

163
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:59,790
- Miss Totten, you forgot your...
- Oh, thank you.

164
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,692
- ... bag.
- Goodbye, Professor.

165
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:03,888
- Goodbye.
- And thank you.

166
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:06,364
I enjoyed every second of it.

167
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:11,202
Miss Totten, you know that
your previous intentions...

168
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:16,368
A most amazing performance, Frisbee.

169
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:17,739
We are very much
indebted to you, Frisbee.

170
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:19,401
I don't know, gentlemen. I don't know.

171
00:11:19,477 --> 00:11:22,241
- You don't understand...
- I don't know whether our behavior

172
00:11:22,313 --> 00:11:24,577
was in keeping with the seriousness
of our work.

173
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:26,981
- Oh, well, I...
- However, I do feel our actions

174
00:11:27,986 --> 00:11:29,544
- were justified in the...
- We beg your pardon, gentlemen.

175
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:30,918
Yes, sir, indeed.

176
00:11:30,988 --> 00:11:33,718
- We hope you don't mind.
- We came through the window.

177
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,917
Who are you?
- We're the window washers.

178
00:11:35,993 --> 00:11:38,689
- The window washers.
- ELFINl: What is it you want?

179
00:11:38,763 --> 00:11:40,628
Well, you gentlemen are long hairs,
aren't you?

180
00:11:40,697 --> 00:11:42,756
I hadn't noticed.
- Our hair is not particularly long.

181
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,233
This place's got some connection
with music, ain't it?

182
00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:46,359
Well, some.

183
00:11:46,435 --> 00:11:49,768
We've been washing on the other side
for a couple of days and listening to you.

184
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,831
We figured maybe you could help us out.

185
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:54,571
- In what way?
- With this quiz program on the radio.

186
00:11:54,645 --> 00:11:55,669
What is it?

187
00:11:55,746 --> 00:11:57,907
It's a musical quiz.
It has questions and answers,

188
00:11:57,981 --> 00:11:59,107
and you got to play the tune.

189
00:11:59,182 --> 00:12:00,615
Maybe we should have got a radio.

190
00:12:00,683 --> 00:12:02,480
Well, just what is your trouble?

191
00:12:02,551 --> 00:12:04,348
Well, I can play the answers,
if I knew the answers.

192
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,445
But he can't play them
if he don't know them.

193
00:12:06,522 --> 00:12:09,286
- That's logical.
- Have you got the questions with you?

194
00:12:09,358 --> 00:12:11,758
- Sure, he's got them.
- Yes, here it is, right here.

195
00:12:11,827 --> 00:12:15,126
Question... First question is number one.

196
00:12:15,197 --> 00:12:18,963
And it says,
"What eminent contra... Contra... "

197
00:12:19,534 --> 00:12:22,970
"What eminent contrapuntalist literally
gave his name to a musical work?"

198
00:12:23,038 --> 00:12:25,939
- That is obvious.
- That would be my department.

199
00:12:26,007 --> 00:12:28,237
- Johann Sebastian Bach.
- Please to meet you.

200
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:29,799
- How do you do?
- How are you, Mr. Bach?

201
00:12:29,877 --> 00:12:31,845
How do you do, Mr. Bach?
I'm not Mr. Bach.

202
00:12:31,912 --> 00:12:33,607
Mr. Bach was born
in Eisenach in Germany,

203
00:12:33,681 --> 00:12:36,809
in the year 1750 and died in 1685.

204
00:12:36,883 --> 00:12:38,214
Are you sure about that, mister?

205
00:12:38,286 --> 00:12:40,516
Yes, I'm sure he died.
They buried him on account of that.

206
00:12:40,587 --> 00:12:42,782
Well, the way you got it,
he didn't even get born.

207
00:12:42,856 --> 00:12:47,657
Well, maybe I'm wrong.
He was born in 1685 and died in 1750.

208
00:12:47,727 --> 00:12:49,422
Mr. Bach wrote beautiful music.
Beautiful music.

209
00:12:49,495 --> 00:12:52,464
- He makes good beer, too.
- That so? I didn't know that. Yeah.

210
00:12:52,533 --> 00:12:55,058
The composition referred to
is a fugue written by Mr. Bach

211
00:12:55,135 --> 00:13:00,471
with the letters of his name B flat,
A, C, and B natural.

212
00:13:00,907 --> 00:13:05,037
B- A-C-B? Bach?

213
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:06,742
That doesn't sound right, does it?

214
00:13:06,814 --> 00:13:08,042
I'm asking you.

215
00:13:08,116 --> 00:13:10,676
The Germans, of course,
use the letter H for our B natural,

216
00:13:10,784 --> 00:13:12,581
meaning B flat when they say B.

217
00:13:12,653 --> 00:13:15,918
- Mister, I don't need all of that.
- He just needs to know the tune.

218
00:13:15,988 --> 00:13:17,512
You mean just a few bars for recognition?

219
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,889
- That's it.
- I'd be very happy to play it for you.

220
00:13:31,369 --> 00:13:33,360
- There you are.
- Is that all there is to it?

221
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:34,837
That's all there is, just the four notes.

222
00:13:34,906 --> 00:13:37,807
Well, I'm going to lay some stuff
with my left hand on the bass here.

223
00:13:37,877 --> 00:13:39,401
When I give you the nod with my head,

224
00:13:39,478 --> 00:13:40,706
you give me them four notes up there.

225
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,245
Very good.

226
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:07,364
- Most unusual.
- It's amazing.

227
00:14:07,437 --> 00:14:09,667
A very remarkable construction
in the bass pattern.

228
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,833
- You think so?
- I'd like to hear more of it.

229
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:13,877
I can't do much with this Bach guy.

230
00:14:13,944 --> 00:14:16,105
No, he's too square.

231
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:18,477
Maybe the next cat's
got a little more beat.

232
00:14:18,548 --> 00:14:20,948
- Who's got the next question?
- He's got them over there.

233
00:14:21,016 --> 00:14:23,143
Frisbee, the second question please.

234
00:14:23,218 --> 00:14:25,311
Oh, yes, right here.

235
00:14:26,356 --> 00:14:27,914
"What bit of African terpsichore

236
00:14:27,991 --> 00:14:30,118
"came from the pen
of a Norwegian composer?"

237
00:14:30,192 --> 00:14:32,717
- That would be you, Gerkikoff.
- That is easy.

238
00:14:32,795 --> 00:14:36,287
That would be Anitra's Dance.
You know the melody, Magenbruch.

239
00:14:36,364 --> 00:14:37,456
Yes, I know it.

240
00:14:37,532 --> 00:14:42,663
Anitra's dance is from Grieg's
incidental music for Ibsen's Peer Gynt.

241
00:14:44,071 --> 00:14:46,938
Would you like to play it for us,
Magenbruch?

242
00:14:53,613 --> 00:14:55,046
Lovely melody.

243
00:14:55,782 --> 00:14:59,616
I heard that before.
Would you play it again for me, please?

244
00:15:00,587 --> 00:15:03,147
It will be interesting to note
what he accomplishes with this one.

245
00:15:03,222 --> 00:15:05,713
- Yes, that's right.
- I think I got it now.

246
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,850
Play it once more for me.

247
00:16:21,497 --> 00:16:22,486
Very good. Very good.

248
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:26,592
Well, it reminds me of
the chaconne or passacaglia.

249
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,833
Except that the amazing variations
on the melody

250
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,601
depend so much on their peculiar
passing tones

251
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:33,539
- and leading notes.
- I noticed a definite resemblance.

252
00:16:33,609 --> 00:16:35,736
It is curious combination of harmonium...

253
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:38,745
It moves constantly
on the tonic and subdominant.

254
00:16:38,812 --> 00:16:40,837
Particularly noticed
the double quadruple figuration.

255
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:44,148
- I didn't do all of that, did I?
- That's just plain boogie-woogie.

256
00:16:44,219 --> 00:16:46,346
- Boogie-woogie. What's that?
- You never heard of that?

257
00:16:46,421 --> 00:16:47,718
Never heard of boogie-woogie?

258
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:49,885
Well, you see, we've been
shut in here for a long time.

259
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,689
- Too long.
- Has this boogie-woogie

260
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:53,127
been going on for some time?

261
00:16:53,195 --> 00:16:54,560
Man alive!

262
00:16:54,631 --> 00:16:57,429
And are there any other forms
of this new folk music besides that?

263
00:16:57,501 --> 00:17:02,803
- Sure. There's swing, jive, jump...
- Blues, two-beat Dixie, rebop and...

264
00:17:02,872 --> 00:17:03,964
What's that?

265
00:17:08,643 --> 00:17:10,634
- Rebop.
- Amazing.

266
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,709
Did you hear that, Professor Frisbee?

267
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,376
ELFINl: And your book on folk music
is almost finished.

268
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,419
Gentlemen, I'm an idiot. An absolute idiot.

269
00:17:18,486 --> 00:17:21,683
And I'm terribly grateful to both of you
for making me aware of it.

270
00:17:21,756 --> 00:17:23,724
Do you realize that since
we've been cooped up here,

271
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:27,024
music has changed
and changed considerably?

272
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:29,724
I've been completely unaware
of this situation.

273
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,959
However, I intend to
rectify it immediately.

274
00:17:32,033 --> 00:17:34,866
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know. I don't know.

275
00:17:34,936 --> 00:17:37,666
I think perhaps the only solution is...

276
00:17:37,738 --> 00:17:39,763
- Gentlemen, I am going out.
- Out?

277
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:41,468
- Where?
- Out. Out into the world.

278
00:17:41,543 --> 00:17:44,637
Out of this house. Out to tap
the major sources of this new music.

279
00:17:44,712 --> 00:17:46,304
- Woogie-boogie?
- Two-beat Dixie?

280
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,574
- Jump?
- Jive?

281
00:17:47,648 --> 00:17:48,740
- Swing?
- Blues?

282
00:17:50,451 --> 00:17:51,713
Rebop.

283
00:17:52,453 --> 00:17:56,719
- Exactly. And I should be leaving now.
- He's going out.

284
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,725
- I should like to go, too.
- Frisbee, could I go with you?

285
00:17:59,793 --> 00:18:01,624
Why couldn't we all go?

286
00:18:01,695 --> 00:18:04,596
- Yes, Frisbee, why couldn't we?
- No, really. Please, gentlemen.

287
00:18:04,664 --> 00:18:07,656
As much as I would love to have you
come along, it was my oversight,

288
00:18:07,734 --> 00:18:09,759
and you'd be losing a full day's work.

289
00:18:09,835 --> 00:18:11,325
After all, this is my field.

290
00:18:11,404 --> 00:18:13,133
Just where would you go, Frisbee?

291
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:15,639
I'm going out to the nightclubs,
the dance halls.

292
00:18:15,707 --> 00:18:18,141
- Yes, even the honky-tonks.
- Aren't you frightened?

293
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:21,304
- No, I... Well, goodbye, Elfini.
- Goodbye, Frisbee.

294
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,007
- Good luck.
- Goodbye, my boy.

295
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,377
Good luck to you.

296
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:26,814
Oh, would you mind leaving the key
under the mat?

297
00:18:26,885 --> 00:18:29,945
I may not be home until 9:00 this evening.

298
00:18:30,022 --> 00:18:31,785
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

299
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:35,517
Goodbye.

300
00:18:36,395 --> 00:18:38,488
I'm worried about the whole thing.

301
00:18:46,371 --> 00:18:47,861
Hiya, bud.

302
00:18:49,373 --> 00:18:51,603
I beg your pardon, could you tell me
what time the music starts?

303
00:18:51,674 --> 00:18:54,404
You're pretty early, fella. This joint
don't open for another couple of hours.

304
00:18:54,477 --> 00:18:57,378
Another couple of... Thank you, thank you.

305
00:19:53,934 --> 00:19:55,902
- How do you do, Mr...
- Mel Powell.

306
00:19:55,969 --> 00:19:58,028
Mel Powell. How do you do? My name is...

307
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,331
- Frisbee.
- Frisbee.

308
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,308
And this card is self explanatory,
Mr. Powell.

309
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:05,970
We're conducting a round table research.

310
00:20:06,045 --> 00:20:07,945
We'd like very much for you to attend...

311
00:20:59,364 --> 00:21:05,098
Blind man stood on the way

312
00:21:05,169 --> 00:21:08,195
and cried!

313
00:21:08,872 --> 00:21:15,539
The blind man stood on the way

314
00:21:15,612 --> 00:21:18,775
and cried!

315
00:21:19,815 --> 00:21:22,045
Cried

316
00:21:22,318 --> 00:21:23,945
Well, old blind Barnabas

317
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,044
Stood on the way

318
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:27,487
Blind Barnabas stood on the way

319
00:21:27,557 --> 00:21:29,252
Well, old blind Barnabas

320
00:21:29,325 --> 00:21:30,587
Stood on the way crying

321
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,821
Oh, Lordie have mercy on me

322
00:21:32,895 --> 00:21:35,625
Well, in my God's bible
in the book of James

323
00:21:35,698 --> 00:21:38,292
Christ was a-healing the cripple
and the lame

324
00:21:38,366 --> 00:21:40,834
Giving the poor and the needy a break

325
00:21:40,902 --> 00:21:42,995
Healing the sick and raising the dead

326
00:21:43,071 --> 00:21:45,562
Well, they tell me
when he passed through Galilee

327
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,370
He passed by a man that couldn't see

328
00:21:48,443 --> 00:21:50,911
The man was blind and crippled from birth

329
00:21:50,979 --> 00:21:53,243
Tell me that his name was blind Barnabas

330
00:21:53,315 --> 00:21:56,045
When Barnabas heard
that my lord was nigh

331
00:21:56,117 --> 00:21:58,244
He fell on his knees and began to cry

332
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:01,083
Crying "Oh, thou man of Galilee

333
00:22:01,156 --> 00:22:03,021
"Great God a mighty have mercy on me... "

334
00:22:42,493 --> 00:22:43,482
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

335
00:23:20,397 --> 00:23:21,625
Yeah!

336
00:24:41,307 --> 00:24:45,937
Daddy-O, I'm gonna teach you some blues

337
00:24:48,314 --> 00:24:54,810
From now on
That's all you'll be able to use

338
00:24:55,253 --> 00:24:57,983
Do you hear me, Daddy-O?

339
00:24:58,056 --> 00:25:02,493
I'm gonna teach you some blues

340
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:06,928
However you wanted it
I sang your song

341
00:25:06,997 --> 00:25:10,524
Whenever you wanted me
I tagged along

342
00:25:10,602 --> 00:25:13,867
But that lipstick on your shirt isn't mine

343
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:17,998
So I'm getting off
It's the end of the line

344
00:25:18,076 --> 00:25:20,567
Do you hear me, Daddy-O

345
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:24,638
I'm gonna teach you some blues

346
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:29,515
He told you that a woman was his religion

347
00:25:29,585 --> 00:25:33,715
But I didn't hear him mention
that he meant them all

348
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:37,124
So now while you're concerned
You're just a dead pigeon

349
00:25:37,194 --> 00:25:41,324
Well, I've got to be the only filly
in the stall

350
00:25:41,397 --> 00:25:44,628
You've got a lot of fish a-waiting
round to nibble

351
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,659
And your baby's got a line
that they can't overload

352
00:25:48,738 --> 00:25:52,265
So, Baby-O, you're hardly
in the mood to quiver

353
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,741
You'll make me very happy
if you hit the road

354
00:25:55,811 --> 00:25:59,474
You gave me the runaround
and that was wrong

355
00:25:59,548 --> 00:26:03,177
You wanted to run around
so run along

356
00:26:03,251 --> 00:26:06,482
If we never meet again, it's too soon

357
00:26:06,554 --> 00:26:10,251
And I'll make a bet
you'll be changing your tune

358
00:26:10,324 --> 00:26:12,986
Do you hear me, Daddy-O?

359
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:17,087
I'm gonna teach you some blues

360
00:26:29,609 --> 00:26:33,443
However you wanted it
I sang your song

361
00:26:33,513 --> 00:26:36,744
Whenever you wanted me
I tagged along

362
00:26:36,816 --> 00:26:40,252
But that lipstick on your shirt isn't mine

363
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:43,982
So I'm getting off
It's the end of the line

364
00:26:44,056 --> 00:26:46,718
Do you hear me, Daddy-O?

365
00:26:46,792 --> 00:26:49,989
I'm gonna teach you some blues!

366
00:26:52,064 --> 00:26:54,055
I'll teach you

367
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,497
I'll teach you

368
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:02,234
I'll teach you

369
00:27:02,306 --> 00:27:05,002
I'm gonna teach you some blues

370
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,451
- Come on, quick.
- Quick is right.

371
00:27:18,523 --> 00:27:19,581
What's the fever?

372
00:27:19,657 --> 00:27:20,783
Listen, you got to take it on the lam.

373
00:27:20,858 --> 00:27:22,826
- Yeah, they're looking for you.
- Wait a minute.

374
00:27:22,894 --> 00:27:24,156
Who's looking for me?

375
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:25,923
- The district attorney.
- Why?

376
00:27:25,997 --> 00:27:27,021
You've got to get dressed
and get out of here

377
00:27:27,098 --> 00:27:28,429
before they slap a subpoena on you.

378
00:27:28,498 --> 00:27:29,760
A subpoena?

379
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:31,095
Come on, we'll talk about it
in the dressing room.

380
00:27:31,167 --> 00:27:33,226
Why can't you tell me here?

381
00:27:33,304 --> 00:27:35,101
Now what it all this subpoena business?

382
00:27:35,172 --> 00:27:36,730
It's on account of Tony.

383
00:27:36,806 --> 00:27:37,932
- What happened to him?
- Nothing.

384
00:27:38,008 --> 00:27:41,000
- But something happened to Ernie Hart.
- Ernie Hart?

385
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,340
I told Tony not to monkey with him.

386
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:45,346
Well, he won't anymore.
The funeral's tomorrow.

387
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:47,109
But Tony didn't have nothing to do with it.
Did he, Monte?

388
00:27:47,182 --> 00:27:49,616
Oh, no. Tony's as innocent
as the new mown hay.

389
00:27:49,685 --> 00:27:51,243
Who said Tony had anything to do with it?

390
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,810
But he was framed, Honey, honest he was.

391
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:53,980
The DA's trying to pin it on him,

392
00:27:54,056 --> 00:27:56,354
just because they found
that ring near the body.

393
00:27:56,427 --> 00:27:58,793
- What ring?
- That ring you gave Tony for his birthday.

394
00:27:58,863 --> 00:28:00,524
Yeah. It was a little too
big for him, remember?

395
00:28:00,598 --> 00:28:02,623
Well, it slipped off
and Tony lost it someplace.

396
00:28:02,699 --> 00:28:04,826
That's why you gotta beat it.
And stay undercover.

397
00:28:04,903 --> 00:28:07,303
What for? What's it got to do with me?

398
00:28:07,371 --> 00:28:09,271
Well, right now they can't prove
that ring was Tony's.

399
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,399
But when the DA finds out you bought it,

400
00:28:11,474 --> 00:28:13,066
and everybody knows about you and Tony.

401
00:28:13,143 --> 00:28:14,405
Well, it'll look awful bad for him.

402
00:28:14,477 --> 00:28:17,002
You're what they call a maternal witness.

403
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:20,480
Tony mixed up in a murder.
I don't believe it.

404
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:23,018
We've got to get you out of here
before they slap a subpoena on you.

405
00:28:25,854 --> 00:28:27,185
Who is it?

406
00:28:27,257 --> 00:28:31,785
I'd like to have a few words with you in
regard to an investigation I'm conducting.

407
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,852
- Just a minute.
- Let him in. We'll handle him.

408
00:28:40,069 --> 00:28:41,696
- Yeah?
- How do you do, Miss Swanson?

409
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:42,794
Hello.

410
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:46,307
I hate to intrude like this,
but this inquiry is really very important.

411
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:48,309
Get this, I don't know from nothing.

412
00:28:48,377 --> 00:28:49,469
But I'm sure you do.

413
00:28:49,546 --> 00:28:51,343
You could probably help me
more than anyone.

414
00:28:51,413 --> 00:28:52,880
All I would like is a little of your time.

415
00:28:52,948 --> 00:28:54,108
Say an hour or so a day.

416
00:28:54,182 --> 00:28:57,310
- Say, are you a cop or aren't you?
- A cop?

417
00:28:57,385 --> 00:28:58,784
No, I'm not a cop.

418
00:28:58,853 --> 00:29:01,788
- Well, then what are you selling?
- Selling?

419
00:29:02,557 --> 00:29:05,890
- Nothing. I'm from the Totten Foundation.
- I don't wear any.

420
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,521
Oh, no, no, I'm Professor Frisbee
of the Totten Musical Foundation.

421
00:29:09,597 --> 00:29:12,862
Well, then what is this
investigation, Professor?

422
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:16,699
Well, it concerns itself with modern jazz
and other forms of popular music.

423
00:29:17,803 --> 00:29:20,499
I'd like you to help me. Would you mind?

424
00:29:20,574 --> 00:29:22,508
Yes, I would. Goodbye.

425
00:29:22,576 --> 00:29:24,806
In case you change your mind,
here's my card.

426
00:29:24,878 --> 00:29:26,675
- Okay. Yeah.
- It's the address of the foundation.

427
00:29:26,747 --> 00:29:28,009
- Good night.
- And also my address.

428
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,445
Goodbye.

429
00:29:35,554 --> 00:29:38,148
- Honey Swanson.
- What do you want?

430
00:29:40,092 --> 00:29:41,354
- Just put the coat on.
- All right.

431
00:29:41,427 --> 00:29:43,452
We'll get out the window.

432
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:45,292
Right in there.

433
00:29:50,169 --> 00:29:52,797
Open up. District attorney's office.

434
00:30:07,551 --> 00:30:10,179
Where to?
- Just keep cruising, Jack.

435
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:12,416
- Where are we going?
- Well...

436
00:30:12,489 --> 00:30:14,013
How about that warehouse on West 11th?

437
00:30:14,091 --> 00:30:15,183
No, too many rats.

438
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:17,124
Hey, wait a minute,
where are you taking me?

439
00:30:17,193 --> 00:30:19,184
We can't take you to your place.
They'll have it covered.

440
00:30:19,262 --> 00:30:23,096
- But you live some place, don't you?
- Yeah, sure, and the cops know where.

441
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:26,158
I thought of a hotel,
but they'll fan every hotel in town.

442
00:30:26,235 --> 00:30:27,429
I could change my name.

443
00:30:27,502 --> 00:30:30,699
Listen, Honey, why take chances?
It's an awful nice warehouse.

444
00:30:30,773 --> 00:30:33,264
He says rats.
Well, maybe a few little bitty mice, but...

445
00:30:33,341 --> 00:30:36,742
- Uh-uh. That's out.
- Say, I got an uncle

446
00:30:36,812 --> 00:30:38,973
who's an undertaker,
and with business the way it is,

447
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:40,912
he's always bound to have an extra slab.

448
00:30:40,982 --> 00:30:44,748
- That's fine, that's all I need.
- Oh, no. Keep thinking.

449
00:30:48,256 --> 00:30:49,883
Hey, what's this?

450
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,959
Totten Foundation.

451
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:57,090
Hobart Frisbee. That's, that professor jerk.
He must have...

452
00:31:03,003 --> 00:31:05,028
ELFINl: I never would have believed it.
It seems impossible.

453
00:31:05,106 --> 00:31:06,198
Have I missed anything?

454
00:31:06,274 --> 00:31:08,970
No, Oddly, I was just explaining,
and I repeat, gentlemen,

455
00:31:09,043 --> 00:31:11,910
I actually heard Rimsky-Korsakov
played on a washboard...

456
00:31:12,012 --> 00:31:13,138
- A washboard?
- ... a bicycle pump...

457
00:31:13,214 --> 00:31:15,045
- Bicycle pump?
- ... a plunger of some sort

458
00:31:15,115 --> 00:31:16,139
and pots and pans.

459
00:31:16,216 --> 00:31:17,513
- Heaven knows what else.
- You cannot make music

460
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,744
out of pots and pans.

461
00:31:18,818 --> 00:31:20,308
Are you sure you had nothing to drink
but buttermilk?

462
00:31:20,386 --> 00:31:22,251
- Quite sure.
- What else was there?

463
00:31:22,323 --> 00:31:23,881
Please tell us.

464
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:26,889
I heard remarkable music,
strange rhythms.

465
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,427
- I talked to people.
- What kind of people?

466
00:31:28,495 --> 00:31:31,828
- All sorts of people. Musicians, singers.
- Chorus girls?

467
00:31:31,897 --> 00:31:33,455
- All sorts of people.
- Prima donnas?

468
00:31:33,532 --> 00:31:36,023
- And did you go backstage?
- Yes, yes, I had...

469
00:31:36,101 --> 00:31:38,592
I had one conversation
with a young girl in her dressing room.

470
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:40,331
- Dressing room!
- But unfortunately

471
00:31:40,406 --> 00:31:42,135
she wasn't interested in our project.

472
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:43,869
A blond or brunette?

473
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,604
I don't remember, Oddly, I didn't notice.

474
00:31:45,677 --> 00:31:48,942
I once went backstage to see Pavlova.

475
00:31:49,014 --> 00:31:51,881
Imagine ballerinas and all that.

476
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:54,477
- In tights, I suppose.
- Naturally in tights.

477
00:31:54,554 --> 00:31:58,957
- And that ineffable smell of rice powder.
- On bare shoulders.

478
00:32:00,392 --> 00:32:02,952
It's getting late, gentlemen,
perhaps we should go to bed.

479
00:32:03,027 --> 00:32:05,860
I'd like to have heard a lot more.
Me, too.

480
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,329
- Frisbee.
- Yes?

481
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:08,798
Frisbee, in your travels this evening,

482
00:32:08,867 --> 00:32:11,267
did you encounter any music
where the melodic figure

483
00:32:11,336 --> 00:32:14,601
in straight eights is changed to one
of Umpateedle character?

484
00:32:14,672 --> 00:32:16,765
- What's that?
- Umpateedle.

485
00:32:16,841 --> 00:32:18,172
What are you reading here, Magenbruch?

486
00:32:18,242 --> 00:32:20,472
That's one of the books
I procured this afternoon.

487
00:32:20,545 --> 00:32:23,446
Jazz.: Hot and Hybrid.
That's very interesting.

488
00:32:23,514 --> 00:32:26,312
I should like to read it
after you're through with it.

489
00:32:26,384 --> 00:32:28,682
Yeah. I particularly like the chapter
on hot rhythm.

490
00:32:28,753 --> 00:32:30,414
Holds strange fascination for me.

491
00:32:30,488 --> 00:32:32,718
I can understand that,
but I wouldn't allow myself

492
00:32:32,788 --> 00:32:34,483
to neglect the Palestrina research.

493
00:32:34,557 --> 00:32:35,546
Hold on.

494
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:40,688
- Why, that's our doorbell.
- At 3:00 in the morning?

495
00:32:40,764 --> 00:32:44,131
That will be the revisions
on Stravinsky's new ballet.

496
00:32:44,201 --> 00:32:46,431
I asked them to be sent by air mail special.

497
00:32:46,502 --> 00:32:47,969
I'll get it.

498
00:32:56,277 --> 00:32:58,939
- Hiya, Professor.
- Oh, hi!

499
00:32:59,015 --> 00:33:00,812
Am I late for school?

500
00:33:02,016 --> 00:33:03,608
Oh, my goodness!

501
00:33:04,687 --> 00:33:06,917
Well, are those kids in my class?

502
00:33:06,988 --> 00:33:09,650
Oh, no, those are just my colleagues.

503
00:33:12,594 --> 00:33:14,789
I must apologize for their lack of attire.

504
00:33:14,863 --> 00:33:16,125
That's all right, Professor.

505
00:33:16,197 --> 00:33:18,358
And for the fact
that I don't have any coat on.

506
00:33:18,433 --> 00:33:20,560
You know, once I watched
my big brother shave.

507
00:33:20,634 --> 00:33:22,363
You did?

508
00:33:22,436 --> 00:33:24,700
Frankly, your coming here
was the last thing I expected.

509
00:33:24,772 --> 00:33:26,262
Your "no" was so definite.

510
00:33:26,341 --> 00:33:28,366
Well, I got thinking it over.

511
00:33:28,442 --> 00:33:29,875
Music has done a lot for me.

512
00:33:29,943 --> 00:33:32,969
And well, here was a chance
to do something for music.

513
00:33:33,146 --> 00:33:34,579
Well, then I take it you've reconsidered?

514
00:33:34,647 --> 00:33:36,114
Yep. You've talked me into it, Professor.

515
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:37,809
Oh, my goodness!

516
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:42,155
- What was that?
- That was Professor Oddly.

517
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:44,917
- Any more of them around?
- I hope not.

518
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:48,658
Boy, this place sure is loaded
with antiques,

519
00:33:48,728 --> 00:33:50,195
present company excepted.

520
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:52,560
Thank you. Thank you.

521
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:55,429
- May I have your coat?
- Yeah. Thanks.

522
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,739
Mozart.

523
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:07,476
Say, I've got a copy like this
with a radio inside.

524
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,144
Are you sure you don't want your coat?

525
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:12,912
No, I'm fine.

526
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:15,646
Except I've got a run in this stocking.

527
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,451
Well, when do we start, Professor?
What's your method?

528
00:34:19,523 --> 00:34:23,220
It's quite simple, really. If you'll be here
no later than 9:30 tomorrow morning.

529
00:34:23,293 --> 00:34:25,090
- Tomorrow morning?
- Yes.

530
00:34:25,162 --> 00:34:26,629
Yes, we've arranged
a round table discussion

531
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:29,029
with a group of people
of various musical backgrounds.

532
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:32,000
You don't think we could
sort of begin right now?

533
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:34,833
Begin... Well, Miss Honey, it's past 3:00.

534
00:34:34,904 --> 00:34:37,896
Oh, foo, Professor,
let's get ourselves a couple of drinks.

535
00:34:37,974 --> 00:34:42,035
You light the fire maybe, and you could
start working on me right away.

536
00:34:42,112 --> 00:34:44,307
I wouldn't dream of imposing at this hour.

537
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:47,076
Listen, I figured on working all night.

538
00:34:47,784 --> 00:34:51,515
Oh, you did...
Well, any random discussion would...

539
00:34:51,586 --> 00:34:52,712
Yes?

540
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,954
...prove of no scientific value whatsoever.

541
00:34:55,024 --> 00:34:57,754
You see, I must have my notes
thoroughly prepared

542
00:34:57,826 --> 00:34:59,259
for tomorrow morning's seminar.

543
00:34:59,327 --> 00:35:01,522
Okay, where do I sleep?

544
00:35:01,595 --> 00:35:04,086
- I beg your pardon.
- Where do I sleep?

545
00:35:04,565 --> 00:35:06,260
I don't know. Where do you usually sleep?

546
00:35:06,334 --> 00:35:09,667
I'm usually in Brooklyn,
but tonight I'm going to sleep here.

547
00:35:09,737 --> 00:35:12,672
- Right. Here?
Why not?

548
00:35:12,741 --> 00:35:15,904
Well, I mean, we're all bachelors here,
Miss Honey,

549
00:35:15,977 --> 00:35:17,137
except maybe Professor Oddly...

550
00:35:17,211 --> 00:35:19,406
- Professor.
- He was a widower.

551
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,814
But there's a... Sleep here?
Oh, no. See, no woman has ever...

552
00:35:23,885 --> 00:35:26,547
Even Miss Bragg, our housekeeper,
goes home every night at 7:30.

553
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:29,852
Listen, if you want me here tomorrow
morning at 9:30...

554
00:35:29,925 --> 00:35:31,756
Yes, I do, Miss Honey. I definitely do.

555
00:35:31,827 --> 00:35:34,421
But even the most free thinking people
would have to respect...

556
00:35:34,495 --> 00:35:36,258
Now wait a minute.

557
00:35:37,097 --> 00:35:38,564
Feel that.

558
00:35:41,135 --> 00:35:43,000
Go on, feel that foot.

559
00:35:46,607 --> 00:35:50,043
- Now, what have you got to say?
- It's cold.

560
00:35:50,477 --> 00:35:52,377
It's cold and it's wet.

561
00:35:52,779 --> 00:35:54,303
Now, come here.

562
00:35:55,515 --> 00:35:57,107
Come here.

563
00:35:58,218 --> 00:35:59,446
Closer.

564
00:36:00,387 --> 00:36:02,321
- Hiya, kids.
- How do you do?

565
00:36:02,388 --> 00:36:04,379
Now, look down my throat.

566
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:08,025
Oh, come on. Now, what do you see, huh?

567
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:09,787
I don't know what to look for.

568
00:36:09,862 --> 00:36:12,228
Well, there is a slight rosiness
in the laryngeal region.

569
00:36:12,297 --> 00:36:14,891
There. You see? He knows. Who are you?

570
00:36:14,966 --> 00:36:16,160
- Who is he?
- This is Professor Twingle.

571
00:36:16,234 --> 00:36:17,963
And Professor Gerkikoff, Dr. Elfini...

572
00:36:18,037 --> 00:36:21,097
Wait a minute, not so fast.
I'll get to know them.

573
00:36:21,172 --> 00:36:23,106
Come here, Twinkie.
I think I got a fever. Feel.

574
00:36:23,175 --> 00:36:25,666
- Oh, yes. She definitely has. Oh, yes.
- Certainly.

575
00:36:25,744 --> 00:36:26,938
And he wants to put me out.

576
00:36:27,012 --> 00:36:29,378
- Oh, no.
- Frisbee, that is unkind.

577
00:36:29,448 --> 00:36:31,609
You know it's been raining
and the streets are still wet.

578
00:36:31,682 --> 00:36:34,116
- Of course.
- No 9:30 for me if he puts me out in that.

579
00:36:34,185 --> 00:36:35,652
- Naturally not.
- But you don't understand...

580
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,188
And the street's cold
and the subway's hot and full of germs.

581
00:36:38,256 --> 00:36:40,724
And I'm a pushover for streptococcus.

582
00:36:40,792 --> 00:36:42,692
- Could I have this, kid?
- Excuse me.

583
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,422
Really, I don't understand you, Frisbee.
Why take chances?

584
00:36:45,496 --> 00:36:48,260
- Yeah. With such valuable material.
- Think of your work, Professor Frisbee.

585
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,231
I am thinking of my work.

586
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,927
- You see, they get the point.
- I get the point, too.

587
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:53,264
What I'm trying desperately to explain...

588
00:36:53,335 --> 00:36:55,530
- Gentlemen, may I make a suggestion?
- Yes?

589
00:36:55,605 --> 00:36:57,334
Why not let the young lady
sleep in my room?

590
00:36:57,407 --> 00:36:58,965
- What?
- Well!

591
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:02,408
I often bunk with Dr. Elfini
during an electrical storm.

592
00:37:02,478 --> 00:37:04,878
- He's afraid of thunder.
Yes.

593
00:37:04,947 --> 00:37:07,711
Well, then it's all settled.
I guess I'll turn in.

594
00:37:09,085 --> 00:37:11,315
- Could I have my coat?
- Yes, yes.

595
00:37:11,387 --> 00:37:13,821
Couldn't you possibly reconsider?

596
00:37:15,458 --> 00:37:17,585
- This way, please.
- I'll show you to my room.

597
00:37:17,659 --> 00:37:18,751
Yes, we all will.

598
00:37:18,827 --> 00:37:21,125
Oh, no. I know where my own room is,
without any help from anyone.

599
00:37:21,196 --> 00:37:22,823
Well now,
why couldn't we all go?

600
00:37:22,897 --> 00:37:27,857
Gentlemen. Please, don't bother. I'll find it.
Just rough out the directions.

601
00:37:27,937 --> 00:37:30,497
Top of the stairs.
The first door to the right.

602
00:37:30,572 --> 00:37:33,040
- Could I have my coat?
- Oh, please.

603
00:37:33,108 --> 00:37:35,736
Thank you. Hi Di Ho.

604
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:36,970
Hi Di Ho.

605
00:37:37,045 --> 00:37:40,378
Just one moment, please.
Gentlemen, this is all highly irregular.

606
00:37:40,447 --> 00:37:42,278
Suppose this came to the attention
of the foundation,

607
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,544
and what about Miss Bragg
in the morning?

608
00:37:43,617 --> 00:37:46,017
What are you talking about?
This is research, isn't it?

609
00:37:46,086 --> 00:37:47,713
- Is it?
- Sure and I'm the guinea pig.

610
00:37:47,788 --> 00:37:51,417
- Yes, a specimen under the microscope.
- Wonderful thing to research.

611
00:37:51,492 --> 00:37:52,823
It is the searchlight of truth.

612
00:37:52,892 --> 00:37:55,087
Without research, people
would still think the earth was flat.

613
00:37:55,161 --> 00:37:56,890
- That's ridiculous.
- And they would still look upon

614
00:37:56,964 --> 00:37:59,296
the tomato as a poisonous fruit.

615
00:37:59,366 --> 00:38:01,027
There, you see.

616
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:04,968
And I want you to look at me,
Professor Frisbee, as another tomato.

617
00:38:05,037 --> 00:38:07,767
- What?
Just another tomato.

618
00:38:22,553 --> 00:38:24,384
That'll be sufficient
for the balance, gentlemen.

619
00:38:24,455 --> 00:38:26,446
- Shall we record it now?
Sure, by all means.

620
00:38:26,523 --> 00:38:29,549
Yes, even Beethoven
seems nice and gay this morning.

621
00:38:29,627 --> 00:38:31,424
You're quite right.
- Gentlemen, before you start,

622
00:38:31,496 --> 00:38:33,896
I should like to talk to you.

623
00:38:34,332 --> 00:38:37,790
May I ask what all your trousers
are doing in my kitchen?

624
00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:40,235
Well, I wanted mine pressed.

625
00:38:40,303 --> 00:38:42,669
- That accounts for one pair.
- So did I.

626
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,866
And I.

627
00:38:43,941 --> 00:38:48,275
All six pairs at once.
What's going on in this house, anyway?

628
00:38:48,746 --> 00:38:50,179
No constitutional this morning.

629
00:38:50,247 --> 00:38:52,511
You scarcely touched your breakfast.

630
00:38:52,582 --> 00:38:55,483
And, Professor Frisbee,
this suitcase just came for you.

631
00:38:55,552 --> 00:38:57,611
- For me?
- The man who left it,

632
00:38:57,687 --> 00:39:00,383
a strange looking character,
said you'd understand.

633
00:39:00,456 --> 00:39:02,788
- He left a message...
- Understand. I don't understand at all.

634
00:39:02,859 --> 00:39:05,953
Well, why don't you open it up, Frisbee?

635
00:39:06,865 --> 00:39:08,890
You say he left a message?

636
00:39:10,168 --> 00:39:11,430
Well!

637
00:39:11,503 --> 00:39:13,334
What were you saying about
the message, Miss Bragg?

638
00:39:13,405 --> 00:39:16,067
- I am waiting for you to explain.
- Explain what?

639
00:39:16,141 --> 00:39:18,200
- That.
- That's...

640
00:39:18,676 --> 00:39:21,509
- He has taken on an assistant.
- Very charming.

641
00:39:21,579 --> 00:39:23,479
- Hi, kids.
Good morning.

642
00:39:23,547 --> 00:39:26,277
Say, where can I get a cup of coffee?
Hi. Who are you?

643
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,875
Miss Honey, may I present Miss Bragg,
our housekeeper.

644
00:39:28,953 --> 00:39:30,818
Hi. This must be your apron I'm wearing.

645
00:39:30,888 --> 00:39:32,822
This suitcase came for you
with a message.

646
00:39:32,889 --> 00:39:34,413
- Yeah? What message?
- I don't know.

647
00:39:34,491 --> 00:39:37,619
The message was it's getting
hotter and hotter and stay in the icebox

648
00:39:37,694 --> 00:39:39,025
like a good little salad.

649
00:39:39,096 --> 00:39:40,654
- Salad?
- What could that mean?

650
00:39:40,731 --> 00:39:42,790
What time is your clambake, Professor?

651
00:39:42,866 --> 00:39:44,663
My clambake is at...

652
00:39:44,735 --> 00:39:48,136
We start at 9:30 in the morning,
and please try not to be late.

653
00:39:48,205 --> 00:39:49,968
Give me a little help with the suitcase,
and I won't be.

654
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:52,166
- Glad to.
- See you later, kids.

655
00:39:52,242 --> 00:39:53,266
Well!

656
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:56,905
Excuse me.

657
00:39:58,748 --> 00:40:01,945
Please continue without me
for a while, gentlemen.

658
00:40:07,856 --> 00:40:10,916
Now, to get back to
the subject under discussion.

659
00:40:10,993 --> 00:40:16,021
If we can classify the various forms of jazz
along with a series of cross references

660
00:40:16,098 --> 00:40:18,828
and make a record of the history
of this type of music,

661
00:40:18,899 --> 00:40:22,027
I believe the work will be
invaluable to the foundation.

662
00:40:22,103 --> 00:40:24,537
- Now, don't you agree, gentlemen?
Yes, sure.

663
00:40:24,605 --> 00:40:26,129
That's good.
And now that we're all agreed,

664
00:40:26,206 --> 00:40:31,075
in the vernacular I heard last night,
let's start on the down beat and take off.

665
00:40:31,412 --> 00:40:32,606
He's got it already.

666
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,138
- Is that the correct way of phrasing it?
- That's a good deal.

667
00:40:36,216 --> 00:40:39,310
Yes. Well, I believe in order to start...

668
00:40:41,553 --> 00:40:44,386
Gentlemen, we have accomplished a lot
in the last three days,

669
00:40:44,457 --> 00:40:46,584
and we have many valuable records.

670
00:40:46,661 --> 00:40:48,754
Now, before we start
on the history of jazz,

671
00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:51,923
someone mentioned yesterday
a small combo doing jump

672
00:40:51,998 --> 00:40:53,363
with a head arrangement.

673
00:40:53,433 --> 00:40:54,764
I believe it was mister...

674
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:57,529
- Tommy Dorsey.
- Jimmy's brother.

675
00:40:57,603 --> 00:41:00,071
Yes. I'm sorry. You spoke of...

676
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,108
It wasn't me, Professor.
That's not my type.

677
00:41:02,174 --> 00:41:03,766
It could have been Mel Powell or Hamp.

678
00:41:03,843 --> 00:41:05,811
Yeah, they're experts at that jive.

679
00:41:05,878 --> 00:41:07,641
Well, then perhaps
you gentlemen could help me.

680
00:41:07,713 --> 00:41:09,908
Sure. Mel and I used to play
a lot of that stuff with Benny Goodman.

681
00:41:09,982 --> 00:41:11,006
Is that so?

682
00:41:11,082 --> 00:41:13,573
Well, could you play an example
of the type of music?

683
00:41:13,652 --> 00:41:16,644
We'd be glad to.
But Joe, our clarinetist, couldn't come.

684
00:41:16,722 --> 00:41:18,849
- That's too bad.
- Can anyone here blow a clarinet?

685
00:41:18,923 --> 00:41:21,323
That's quite simple. Our Professor
Magenbruch plays the clarinet.

686
00:41:21,392 --> 00:41:24,725
- Well, does he, Professor? I hardly think...
- He's apt to be a little too square.

687
00:41:24,796 --> 00:41:26,354
He's quite proficient. I assure you.

688
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:29,524
If you'll just get ready,
I'll go and fetch him.

689
00:41:31,235 --> 00:41:33,897
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.
I don't wish to interrupt,

690
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:36,837
but we seem to need a clarinet
to illustrate a new form of music.

691
00:41:36,907 --> 00:41:39,205
- Why, certainly, here you go.
- Thank you very much.

692
00:41:39,276 --> 00:41:41,642
No, Magenbruch, we need you with it.

693
00:41:41,711 --> 00:41:42,735
You mean to play jazz?

694
00:41:42,812 --> 00:41:45,872
Yes, it's very likely you might
be able to play your Umpateedle.

695
00:41:45,949 --> 00:41:47,610
Then, I better take my book
along with me.

696
00:41:47,683 --> 00:41:49,173
- Yes.
- Good, then we'll all go along.

697
00:41:49,251 --> 00:41:50,718
- Yeah, sure.
- I think not, gentlemen.

698
00:41:50,785 --> 00:41:52,844
Perhaps you'd better continue
with your work.

699
00:41:52,923 --> 00:41:54,390
I wish we could go, too.

700
00:41:57,159 --> 00:41:59,218
This is our Professor Magenbruch,
gentlemen.

701
00:41:59,296 --> 00:42:00,695
- Hello.
- Hello.

702
00:42:00,763 --> 00:42:03,391
- I see you have everything ready.
- Is this the music here?

703
00:42:03,466 --> 00:42:04,990
Oh, no. We don't use any music.

704
00:42:05,067 --> 00:42:07,194
We haven't got anything written down,
Professor.

705
00:42:07,269 --> 00:42:09,294
Well, we can't play without music.

706
00:42:09,371 --> 00:42:11,635
- Well, Benny Goodman used to.
- Benny Goodman? I never...

707
00:42:11,706 --> 00:42:13,901
- Frisbee, did you ever hear of him?
- No, no, I haven't.

708
00:42:13,975 --> 00:42:16,409
Perhaps there is something in this book
that might help you, Magenbruch.

709
00:42:16,479 --> 00:42:18,071
- Yes. Yes.
- Just sit down, Professor,

710
00:42:18,146 --> 00:42:19,909
and if you feel like it, you can join in.

711
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,813
- Thank you.
- Mel, let's steal some apples.

712
00:42:40,066 --> 00:42:43,797
That's fine, Professor.
Now anything we do, just follow us.

713
00:44:53,827 --> 00:44:58,093
Young lady, young lady, come here.
Come with me, please.

714
00:45:06,672 --> 00:45:10,472
Young lady, there are a couple
of gentlemen, I use the word loosely,

715
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:11,531
who would like to see you.

716
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:13,976
They're in the garden
right through that door.

717
00:45:14,046 --> 00:45:15,035
Thanks, cookie.

718
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:21,986
Well, it's about time.

719
00:45:22,054 --> 00:45:24,818
I thought you two had amnesia
and forgot where you parked me.

720
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:27,585
- We had trouble getting here.
- The DA has got 100 men looking for you.

721
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:30,527
- You're hotter than a firecracker.
- Squeezing this town through a sieve.

722
00:45:30,595 --> 00:45:32,495
Well, okay. You wait here.
I'll get my things.

723
00:45:32,565 --> 00:45:34,829
- Now, wait a minute.
- You're not leaving. Not now.

724
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:37,459
- Where's Tony?
- Well, he's on his way to Jersey.

725
00:45:37,535 --> 00:45:39,867
- He'll call you from there.
- That's part of the big surprise.

726
00:45:39,938 --> 00:45:42,907
- I don't like surprises.
- You'll like this one.

727
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:46,272
- Flash it on her. Go on.
- Put on your sunglasses.

728
00:45:47,979 --> 00:45:51,039
- Oh, boy.
- Seven grand boiled into that one.

729
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:54,607
Well, Tony doesn't have to bribe me
just because I do him a little favor.

730
00:45:54,684 --> 00:45:56,811
I'd like to see him try and get it back.

731
00:45:56,886 --> 00:46:00,083
- Hey, it's a little big.
- Third finger, left hand.

732
00:46:00,556 --> 00:46:02,217
Say, who do you think you're kidding?

733
00:46:02,291 --> 00:46:04,816
- The future Mrs. Tony Crow.
- What?

734
00:46:04,894 --> 00:46:07,385
Tony's finally decided to use
that license you took out last June.

735
00:46:07,463 --> 00:46:09,090
Well, it's about time.

736
00:46:09,165 --> 00:46:10,792
It was his mouthpiece's idea.

737
00:46:10,865 --> 00:46:13,265
A wife can't testify
against her husband, see?

738
00:46:13,335 --> 00:46:15,166
Don't put it that way, you dope.

739
00:46:15,235 --> 00:46:17,260
Say, he's been crazy about you
since you met.

740
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:20,001
Yeah, but it took the DA
to make him pop the question.

741
00:46:20,076 --> 00:46:21,634
He's really got a big crush on you.

742
00:46:21,711 --> 00:46:24,009
Sure. Only the other day he said to me,

743
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,947
"I get a bigger bang out of that Honey
than any dame I ever knew. "

744
00:46:27,015 --> 00:46:28,448
- Yeah?
- You don't know how lucky you are.

745
00:46:28,516 --> 00:46:31,144
Oh, don't I though? Mrs. Tony Crow.

746
00:46:31,754 --> 00:46:35,019
Diamonds, and ermine
and a house in Westchester.

747
00:46:35,091 --> 00:46:36,456
The wedding's gotta be a fast one.

748
00:46:36,525 --> 00:46:38,288
Now, lay low and stick close by the phone.

749
00:46:38,361 --> 00:46:40,886
- We'll call you tomorrow morning.
- Yeah. The bride will be waiting.

750
00:46:40,962 --> 00:46:42,953
Hey, here's a paper
that's got the whole story.

751
00:46:43,031 --> 00:46:45,499
Read it in your room, Mrs. Crow.

752
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:52,301
Oh, fine!

753
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,875
Gentlemen, if I may have
just one moment.

754
00:47:01,949 --> 00:47:06,147
Gentlemen, if you please.
I think we are just about ready to record.

755
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:15,322
"The Totten Musical Encyclopedia,
recording number 684J,

756
00:47:15,394 --> 00:47:20,331
"illustrating chapters 22 to 29
in Volume 11, The History of Jazz.

757
00:47:20,867 --> 00:47:24,359
"From Africa came the first
musical instrument, a drum.

758
00:47:28,174 --> 00:47:30,802
"The hollow trunk of a tree
or a taut animal hide

759
00:47:30,876 --> 00:47:33,071
"supplied the rhythm or beat.

760
00:47:33,145 --> 00:47:36,308
"To the basic rhythm
was added the human voice.

761
00:47:41,554 --> 00:47:45,149
"Next, the first wind instrument,
the shepherd's flute.

762

"The basic beat of the tom-tom

"of the chant that was carried
across oceans

764
00:47:56,634 --> 00:48:01,128
"and contained in early Spanish music
after the invention of the guitar.

765
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,582
"It spread to countries
which share the Spanish language.

766

"Cuba, West Indies, and South America

"The ever-widening cycle finally reached

769
00:48:35,205 --> 00:48:37,400
"where the beat was momentarily lost,

770
00:48:37,474 --> 00:48:40,910
"but the melody was woven
into pure Negro spiritual. "

771
00:48:43,511 --> 00:48:47,504
- Mockingbird
- Mockingbird

772
00:48:47,582 --> 00:48:50,983
- Sang at morn
- Sang at morn

773
00:48:51,452 --> 00:48:57,220
- And a song was born
- And a song was born

774
00:48:57,658 --> 00:49:01,253
- Mockingbird
- Mockingbird

775
00:49:01,328 --> 00:49:04,855
- Sang at morn
- Sang at morn

776
00:49:05,198 --> 00:49:10,500
- And a song was born
- And a song was born

777
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:11,859
Then, the beat returned.

778
00:49:11,938 --> 00:49:13,838
Well, the mockingbird

779
00:49:13,906 --> 00:49:16,204
- Mockingbird
- Mockingbird

780
00:49:16,275 --> 00:49:17,674
Oh, mockingbird

781
00:49:17,743 --> 00:49:19,210
- Well, Lord looked down
- Well, Lord looked down

782
00:49:19,278 --> 00:49:20,575
- And he gave the word
- And he gave the word

00:49:20,646 --> 00:49:22,136
- And the angels put a song
- And the angels put a song

00:49:22,215 --> 00:49:23,512
- In the mockingbird
- In the mockingbird

00:49:23,582 --> 00:49:24,879
- When man was born
- When man was born

786
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:26,611
- He liked what he heard
- He liked what he heard

787
00:49:26,685 --> 00:49:27,811
- And sang to the Lord
- And sang to the Lord

788
00:49:27,887 --> 00:49:29,081
- With the mockingbird
- With the mockingbird

789
00:49:29,155 --> 00:49:31,646
Singing, Lord, hear me

790
00:49:31,723 --> 00:49:34,851
Well, he sang to the Lord
With the mockingbird

791
00:49:34,925 --> 00:49:37,553
Praise be

792
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:38,756
- And the good Lord
- And the good Lord

793
00:49:38,831 --> 00:49:41,322
- Liked everything he heard
- Liked everything he heard

794
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:49,701
They took the tune and the words

795
00:49:49,774 --> 00:49:52,174
Right from the mockingbirds

796
00:49:52,243 --> 00:49:56,009
That's how a song was born

797
00:49:56,948 --> 00:50:00,679
And then a soft evening breeze

798
00:50:00,751 --> 00:50:03,083
Hummed through the willow trees

799
00:50:03,153 --> 00:50:06,953
That's how a song was born

800
00:50:07,925 --> 00:50:14,091
The tinkling rain from the sky
became a lullaby

801
00:50:14,166 --> 00:50:18,933
And the blues must have come from a sigh

802
00:50:19,003 --> 00:50:22,803
And when two hearts beat in time

803
00:50:22,875 --> 00:50:25,241
Bluebells began to chime

804
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:29,246
That's how a song was born

805
00:50:30,849 --> 00:50:33,477
They took a beat and made it reet

806
00:50:33,551 --> 00:50:36,816
They took a beat
and brought it down to Basin Street

807
00:50:36,888 --> 00:50:39,254
Now we got it jumpin'

808
00:50:39,324 --> 00:50:41,986
Satchmo, get on that horn

809
00:50:42,059 --> 00:50:44,721
Let's hear, let's hear

810
00:50:44,795 --> 00:50:47,286
Let's hear how jazz was born

811
00:50:52,203 --> 00:50:54,068
One, two, three, four.

812
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:59,967
They took a reet jungle beat

813
00:51:00,043 --> 00:51:01,704
Brought it to Basin Street

814
00:51:01,778 --> 00:51:04,872
And that's how jazz was born

815
00:51:04,947 --> 00:51:07,347
And then someone played a waiI

816
00:51:07,417 --> 00:51:09,282
All up and down the scale

817
00:51:09,352 --> 00:51:12,719
And that's how jazz was born

818
00:51:12,788 --> 00:51:15,018
They simply played what they liked

819
00:51:15,091 --> 00:51:17,059
As long as it would fit

820
00:51:17,126 --> 00:51:18,718
If it just had a beat

821
00:51:18,794 --> 00:51:20,352
That was it

822
00:51:20,428 --> 00:51:22,862
And when a horn gave a scream

823
00:51:22,932 --> 00:51:24,832
They took it as a theme

824
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,664
And that's how jazz was born

825
00:52:00,401 --> 00:52:02,130
Blow it, Professor.

826
00:53:24,948 --> 00:53:27,041
- Hiya, kids.
- The expert is here.

827
00:53:27,116 --> 00:53:28,140
We need you.

828
00:53:28,217 --> 00:53:29,241
- Yes, very much.
- What's the trouble?

829
00:53:29,318 --> 00:53:31,149
We've been listening to the music
from across the hall.

830
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:33,688
- It's very nice.
- They've been having jam sessions.

831
00:53:33,755 --> 00:53:35,222
- A jam session.
- It sounds like a lot of fun.

832
00:53:35,288 --> 00:53:36,653
- We'd like to try it.
- Why don't you?

833
00:53:36,724 --> 00:53:37,884
We don't know how to begin.

834
00:53:37,959 --> 00:53:39,688
They don't seem to have
any kind of set form.

835
00:53:39,762 --> 00:53:44,222
Well, you're right there.
That's exactly what a jam session is.

836
00:53:44,298 --> 00:53:48,291
The first thing you want to do
is let a little light in here.

837
00:53:48,369 --> 00:53:51,964
Okay, kids, now all kind of gather around,
and we'll get into it.

838
00:53:52,038 --> 00:53:55,201
A jam session is taking a little tune
you all know and doing things with it.

839
00:53:55,276 --> 00:53:57,904
- Doing things?
- Sort of kicking it around like...

840
00:53:57,979 --> 00:53:59,412
Well, what music do you know?

841
00:53:59,479 --> 00:54:01,037
- You mean jump?
- Jive?

842
00:54:01,114 --> 00:54:02,479
- Swing?
- ELFINl: Blues?

843
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:04,708
Rebop.

844
00:54:04,785 --> 00:54:06,252
- Hello.
- Hello.

845
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:08,047
Miss Honey, these are
two good friends of ours.

846
00:54:08,121 --> 00:54:09,520
- We're the window washers.
- We're the window washers.

847
00:54:09,591 --> 00:54:10,717
- He's Buck.
- And that's Bubbles.

848
00:54:10,792 --> 00:54:12,657
- Hi.
- We're about to have a little jam session.

849
00:54:12,727 --> 00:54:13,716
Would you care to join us?

850
00:54:13,795 --> 00:54:14,819
- We sure would.
- We sure would.

851
00:54:14,895 --> 00:54:16,453
Okay. Let's get back.
Now, where were we?

852
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:18,430
- We were talking about jump.
- Jive.

853
00:54:18,498 --> 00:54:20,090
- Swing.
- Well, then you kids know all that.

854
00:54:20,167 --> 00:54:21,691
No, we don't know any
of that kind of music.

855
00:54:21,767 --> 00:54:24,395
- They taught us those words.
- Well, that makes it kind of tough.

856
00:54:24,472 --> 00:54:25,700
Now, what do you know?

857
00:54:25,772 --> 00:54:27,706
- Well, we know Beethoven.
- Bizet.

858
00:54:27,774 --> 00:54:28,763
- Wagner.
- Brahms.

859
00:54:28,842 --> 00:54:30,469
Don't you know anything
lighter than that?

860
00:54:30,544 --> 00:54:31,806
- Symphonies.
- Concertos.

861
00:54:31,878 --> 00:54:33,072
- Operas.
- Operas?

862
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:34,510
- Oh, yes.
- We know all of them.

863
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:36,878
Well, this will be a new kind of jam
session, a long-haired one.

864
00:54:36,949 --> 00:54:38,109
- Can you sing?
- No. No.

865
00:54:38,184 --> 00:54:40,118
I'm afraid we don't know the words
to the operas.

866
00:54:40,186 --> 00:54:41,676
- We're more interested in music.
- Any words will do.

867
00:54:41,754 --> 00:54:43,483
You got a newspaper, or a time-table
or something?

868
00:54:43,555 --> 00:54:44,544
Sure, he's got something.

869
00:54:44,622 --> 00:54:46,988
- How will this be?
- What have you got there, Bubbles?

870
00:54:47,058 --> 00:54:50,027
This is fine.
But we've gotta do a little rehearsing.

871
00:54:50,095 --> 00:54:51,824
Now, this is what I want you to do.

872
00:54:51,896 --> 00:54:54,228
You're to sing the words
from the piece I give you.

873
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:56,399
- Here is yours.
- Thank you.

874
00:54:56,468 --> 00:54:59,403
Here is yours.
Just sing whatever you read.

875
00:55:03,807 --> 00:55:07,174
Totten Musical Encyclopedia,
long-haired jam session.

876
00:55:08,077 --> 00:55:10,045
- All ready, kids?
- Yes, yes, indeed.

877
00:55:10,114 --> 00:55:12,480
Okay, let's go. Now watch it.

878
00:55:19,289 --> 00:55:22,918
Daily racing form selections
Post positions and the odds

879
00:55:25,896 --> 00:55:29,263
Weather raining, and it's muddy
and the track is very slow

880
00:55:29,332 --> 00:55:34,065
I think I like Sad Sack

881
00:55:34,137 --> 00:55:40,508
It says he worked a mile in 1.:57 flat

882
00:55:40,576 --> 00:55:42,100
Too bad he scratched

883
00:55:42,178 --> 00:55:45,477
Oh, why did poor old Sad Sack have to go

884
00:55:45,547 --> 00:55:48,744
- Why did poor old Sad Sack
- Why did poor old Sad Sack

885
00:55:48,817 --> 00:55:51,411
- Have to go get scratched
- Have to go get scratched

886
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,387
They're off!

887
00:55:55,624 --> 00:55:58,616
Giddyup, giddyup, giddyup, yap yap
Giddyup, giddyup, giddyup, yap yap

888
00:55:58,693 --> 00:56:00,251
Giddyup, giddyup, giddyup, yap yap

889
00:56:00,327 --> 00:56:01,658
- Who's ahead? Who's ahead?
- Gallorett's in front

890
00:56:01,729 --> 00:56:02,718
- By a nose
- By a neck

891
00:56:02,796 --> 00:56:03,785
By half a length

892
00:56:03,864 --> 00:56:05,627
Man O' War's at the clubhouse turn

893
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:08,327
Flying Schmo's last

894
00:56:09,335 --> 00:56:11,735
Forty lengths behind

895
00:56:12,839 --> 00:56:15,933
- Run, run, run, run
- Run, run, run, run

896
00:56:16,009 --> 00:56:19,137
- Go, go, go, go
- Go, go, go, go

897
00:56:19,212 --> 00:56:22,181
- Run, run, Honeymoon
- Run, run, Honeymoon

898
00:56:24,918 --> 00:56:26,385
Thank you all very much, gentlemen,
same time tomorrow.

899
00:56:26,452 --> 00:56:27,783
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay, Professor.

900
00:56:27,855 --> 00:56:28,947
- Nice going, Magenbruch.
- Thanks.

901
00:56:29,022 --> 00:56:30,614
That was swell, Mag.
Okay, Fris.

902
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:32,123
Just listen to that.

903
00:56:32,192 --> 00:56:35,093
Professor Frisbee, either that woman
leaves this house, or I do.

904
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,321
- Are you speaking of Miss Honey?
- I am.

905
00:56:37,396 --> 00:56:39,557
Ever since that woman
crossed this threshold,

906
00:56:39,631 --> 00:56:42,759
a prairie fire of orgiastic events
has swept through this house.

907
00:56:55,346 --> 00:56:58,509
- Frisbee! Are you hurt?
- No, it merely startled me.

908
00:56:58,583 --> 00:57:00,744
- It must have fallen from that shelf.
- Yes.

909
00:57:00,818 --> 00:57:02,979
- I'll put it back.
- It was probably sympathetic vibration

910
00:57:03,053 --> 00:57:04,213
that caused it to fall.

911
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:06,881
Resonance can be a very powerful thing.

912
00:57:06,958 --> 00:57:08,391
- It has been proved.
- That's true.

913
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:11,052
Seven trumpets tumbled
down the walls of Jericho.

914
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:13,220
Caruso shattered a wineglass
by merely singing at it.

915
00:57:13,297 --> 00:57:15,231
- True.
- That's all very interesting gentlemen,

916
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:18,290
but our whole project seems to be
suffering from some sort of vibration.

917
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:20,836
- What do you mean?
- I'd like to talk to Miss Honey alone.

918
00:57:20,903 --> 00:57:23,565
- But we were...
- If you don't mind.

919
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:40,282
Now, Miss Honey.
Would you take this chair, please?

920
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,685
- That particular chair?
- Yes, if you don't mind.

921
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:45,887
Okay.

922
00:57:47,229 --> 00:57:49,663
Would you open your mouth?
A little wider.

923
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,300
- Thank you.
- Can I close it now?

924
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:54,893
Oh, please do.

925
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:56,369
- Miss Honey.
- Yeah.

926
00:57:56,438 --> 00:58:00,204
Circumstances under which, that is, over
which none of us has the least control

927
00:58:00,275 --> 00:58:03,369
force me to a step
I am most reluctant to take.

928
00:58:03,445 --> 00:58:06,505
The sky is perfectly clear,
the thermometer is at 76,

929
00:58:06,581 --> 00:58:09,311
your throat appears quite normal.

930
00:58:09,384 --> 00:58:11,579
I'm afraid I must ask you to leave.

931
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,554
Leave here? Why?

932
00:58:14,455 --> 00:58:18,448
I want you to look at this project,
this history of music, as a voyage,

933
00:58:18,526 --> 00:58:21,290
a long, hard tedious voyage.

934
00:58:21,361 --> 00:58:24,660
And when the Foundation
first launched its vessel,

935
00:58:24,731 --> 00:58:27,700
it wisely followed an old rule of the sea.

936
00:58:27,768 --> 00:58:29,360
No women aboard.

937
00:58:29,803 --> 00:58:32,397
Consequently they chose a crew
of single men

938
00:58:32,471 --> 00:58:35,031
with nothing to distract them
from the course they were about to sail.

939
00:58:35,109 --> 00:58:37,168
Say, Junior, you couldn't stop
walking up and down here?

940
00:58:37,244 --> 00:58:38,609
For the last four days, Miss Honey,

941
00:58:38,678 --> 00:58:40,908
we have been doing nothing
but just drifting.

942
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:44,006
The needle of the compass
no longer points to the magnetic pole.

943
00:58:44,084 --> 00:58:46,609
It points, if I may say so, to your ankles.

944
00:58:46,686 --> 00:58:48,984
Come now, admiral,
a bunch of grown men.

945
00:58:49,055 --> 00:58:52,855
- They've all seen a pair of ankles before.
- Not in nine years, they haven't.

946
00:58:52,924 --> 00:58:56,087
Except for the singularly uninspired
underpinnings of Miss Bragg.

947
00:58:56,161 --> 00:58:58,891
Well, if you think I'm bothering them,
I'll sit on my legs,

948
00:58:58,964 --> 00:59:01,125
and I'll do it in my room or in the kitchen.

949
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,498
It's too late. You must leave now.

950
00:59:03,568 --> 00:59:05,126
But I can't leave now.

951
00:59:05,203 --> 00:59:08,331
What about your work?
It isn't even finished.

952
00:59:08,405 --> 00:59:09,804
There are a lot of things
we haven't even touched on.

953
00:59:09,874 --> 00:59:10,932
Make no mistake, Miss Honey,

954
00:59:11,008 --> 00:59:13,476
I shall regret deeply the absence
of your keen mind.

955
00:59:13,544 --> 00:59:16,877
But, unfortunately, it's inseparable
from an extremely disturbing body.

956
00:59:18,682 --> 00:59:20,013
All right, I'll go.

957
00:59:20,084 --> 00:59:21,847
Only don't shove.
I'll leave some time tomorrow.

958
00:59:21,919 --> 00:59:22,943
No, not tomorrow. Right away.

959
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:25,352
- But I tell you I...
- I insist.

960
00:59:25,422 --> 00:59:28,323
- Old crabapple Annie. Listen...
- Crabapple Annie!

961
00:59:28,391 --> 00:59:30,256
Why that implies that I'm puritanical
and narrow-minded.

962
00:59:30,327 --> 00:59:31,316
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm not.

963
00:59:31,394 --> 00:59:33,328
I'm a perfectly normal man
with perfectly normal instincts.

964
00:59:33,396 --> 00:59:36,490
- An awful high boiling point.
- Not even that.

965
00:59:36,566 --> 00:59:38,363
I, too, have been acutely aware
of your presence.

966
00:59:38,434 --> 00:59:39,458
You have?

967
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:42,435
But fortunately, I'm strong enough to
be able to resist its demoralizing effects.

968
00:59:42,505 --> 00:59:43,529
Oh, really?

969
00:59:43,607 --> 00:59:45,768
I admit at times
it was quite a struggle, but...

970
00:59:45,843 --> 00:59:48,710
- Like when?
- Well, twice to be exact.

971
00:59:48,778 --> 00:59:50,245
The first time
when you leaned over my shoulder

972
00:59:50,313 --> 00:59:51,837
to explain the meaning of the word riff.

973
00:59:51,913 --> 00:59:54,507
- And the second time?
- I'm not finished with the first time.

974
00:59:54,584 --> 00:59:57,576
You leaned over my shoulder,
and I felt your breath on my ear.

975
00:59:57,652 --> 00:59:59,119
- And...
- And the second time,

976
00:59:59,188 --> 01:00:02,783
you were standing up against the window
with the sunlight in your hair.

977
01:00:02,858 --> 01:00:06,191
- But you didn't do anything about it.
- Yes, I did. I left the room.

978
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:08,057
I went upstairs,
dipped my handkerchief into cold water

979
01:00:08,129 --> 01:00:10,620
and put it on the back of my neck.
Right here, where the nerve center is.

980
01:00:10,699 --> 01:00:11,859
You're cute.

981
01:00:11,932 --> 01:00:15,493
Just a little sunlight in my hair
and you had to water your neck.

982
01:00:15,569 --> 01:00:17,799
Well, perhaps
I shouldn't have mentioned it.

983
01:00:17,872 --> 01:00:18,896
But I'm trying to explain

984
01:00:18,973 --> 01:00:22,966
that the whole success
of the project depends on this.

985
01:00:23,042 --> 01:00:27,274
I want you to cooperate.

986
01:00:28,349 --> 01:00:31,147
I'd like you to leave.

987
01:00:32,519 --> 01:00:37,081
- Do you really mean that?
- Yes, I do. I do.

988
01:00:38,524 --> 01:00:41,857
Well, as long as I'm leaving anyway,
I may as well spill it.

989
01:00:41,927 --> 01:00:43,622
Spill it? Spill what?

990
01:00:43,696 --> 01:00:45,493
Why do you think I came here
in the first place?

991
01:00:45,565 --> 01:00:48,898
- Well, I imagine to help me in my research.
- No, I came on account of you.

992
01:00:48,968 --> 01:00:50,435
- On account of me?
- Yeah.

993
01:00:50,503 --> 01:00:51,492
Of all the men I've ever met,

994
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:55,301
I had to fall for a strong,
silent man of distinction.

995
01:00:55,374 --> 01:00:57,205
- Distinction...
- A man of unbending willpower,

996
01:00:57,276 --> 01:01:00,074
a man who can just flip me away
like an old cigarette butt.

997
01:01:00,145 --> 01:01:03,603
- Now, don't let it upset you, Miss Honey.
- But it does upset me.

998
01:01:03,682 --> 01:01:08,551
Unfortunately, I don't happen to be strong.
I can't steel myself against you.

999
01:01:08,619 --> 01:01:10,519
- Against me?
- Yeah, you.

1000
01:01:12,022 --> 01:01:16,220
Maybe it sounds crazy, but to me,
you're a regular yumyum type.

1001
01:01:16,294 --> 01:01:19,525
- A yumyum?
- Yeah, you know what that means?

1002
01:01:19,597 --> 01:01:21,258
No, we haven't gotten to that yet.

1003
01:01:21,331 --> 01:01:24,164
We've got to it now, and I'm glad it's out.

1004
01:01:24,237 --> 01:01:26,068
I don't give a whoop
if the others went for me.

1005
01:01:26,139 --> 01:01:30,166
It's you I'm wacky about. Just plain wacky.
Can you understand that?

1006
01:01:30,244 --> 01:01:32,371
- Please, Miss Honey...
- Please nothing.

1007
01:01:32,445 --> 01:01:37,178
Maybe you can generate or whatever it is
for all that suppress business, but I can't.

1008
01:01:37,249 --> 01:01:40,912
Come here. You're so tall.

1009
01:01:42,754 --> 01:01:44,654
- What are you doing?
- You'll find out.

1010
01:01:44,723 --> 01:01:46,315
That's an extremely valuable
reference book.

1011
01:01:46,391 --> 01:01:48,382
That's just too bad.

1012
01:01:49,628 --> 01:01:51,596
- Just perfect.
- What are you gonna do?

1013
01:01:51,662 --> 01:01:54,222
I'm going to show you what yumyum is.

1014
01:01:54,299 --> 01:01:56,028
Here's yum.

1015
01:01:57,469 --> 01:01:59,494
And here's the other yum.

1016
01:02:01,273 --> 01:02:03,434
And here's yumyum.

1017
01:02:08,312 --> 01:02:11,042
- Pardon me.
- Hey, where are you going?

1018
01:02:16,654 --> 01:02:18,679
Did you see?
He almost stepped on my hand.

1019
01:02:18,756 --> 01:02:20,815
- Three steps at a time.
- Like a shot out of a gun.

1020
01:02:20,891 --> 01:02:21,983
- Why?
- I don't know.

1021
01:02:22,058 --> 01:02:25,824
To get a razor strap I hope,
and I hope he knows where to apply it.

1022
01:02:37,239 --> 01:02:40,231
- Well, Professor Frisbee?
- Yes, Miss Bragg.

1023
01:02:41,043 --> 01:02:44,376
Would someone call a taxicab
for Miss Honey, please?

1024
01:02:44,445 --> 01:02:46,413
Of course, right away.

1025
01:02:56,823 --> 01:02:59,018
- Fine business.
- I beg your pardon?

1026
01:02:59,092 --> 01:03:00,957
What's the big idea
of running out on me like that?

1027
01:03:01,029 --> 01:03:02,826
Oh, nothing. Nothing.

1028
01:03:03,198 --> 01:03:05,598
I've been thinking, Miss Honey, and...

1029
01:03:05,667 --> 01:03:10,229
Well, the last few minutes
have confirmed my former decision.

1030
01:03:10,305 --> 01:03:12,500
Your further presence here would be fatal.

1031
01:03:12,574 --> 01:03:16,704
You must get me out of your mind
just as I must get you out of this house.

1032
01:03:16,777 --> 01:03:18,506
Your hair's wet.

1033
01:03:18,579 --> 01:03:21,605
- Well, never mind, please.
- Well, it is wet.

1034
01:03:21,682 --> 01:03:23,149
Well, what of it?

1035
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:25,309
Nothing. I just happened to notice it.

1036
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:28,876
- Well, forget it, please.
- Okay, okay, but it is wet.

1037
01:03:29,488 --> 01:03:32,651
Now, to get back
to the subject under discussion.

1038
01:03:33,293 --> 01:03:37,024
It would be idle for me to deny that I too
feel very strongly

1039
01:03:37,096 --> 01:03:40,463
this affinity that you spoke about
a few minutes ago.

1040
01:03:40,533 --> 01:03:43,934
But after three years
when my work is finished,

1041
01:03:44,002 --> 01:03:47,438
perhaps we can take up where we left off.

1042
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:50,700
In the meantime,
I hope that we may continue

1043
01:03:50,775 --> 01:03:53,573
with some sort of correspondence.

1044
01:03:55,013 --> 01:03:58,380
- Would you, Miss Honey?
- Oh, Frizzy.

1045
01:03:59,583 --> 01:04:00,880
I know.

1046
01:04:00,952 --> 01:04:04,183
That's the way I feel, too, but it has to be.

1047
01:04:05,357 --> 01:04:08,326
Just one more thing before you go,
Miss Honey.

1048
01:04:08,392 --> 01:04:11,020
It will probably be a long time

1049
01:04:11,095 --> 01:04:16,465
and I thought perhaps... Well, that is... I...

1050
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:23,801
Would you yum me just once more?

1051
01:04:30,246 --> 01:04:32,942
- It seems so unnecessary.
- Yes, it does.

1052
01:04:33,016 --> 01:04:34,779
I think it's very...

1053
01:04:35,818 --> 01:04:38,082
- Taxi is here.
- I'll tell him.

1054
01:04:42,157 --> 01:04:45,718
Professor Frisbee, the taxi
for that young woman is here.

1055
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:52,490
Professor Frisbee, the taxi. The taxi!

1056
01:04:56,003 --> 01:04:58,699
- Yes, what is it?
- The taxi is here.

1057
01:04:59,407 --> 01:05:02,069
Taxi? What taxi?

1058
01:05:02,743 --> 01:05:04,643
Miss Swanson's or mine?

1059
01:05:06,915 --> 01:05:09,315
It's all yours, crabapple Annie!

1060
01:05:16,557 --> 01:05:18,752
- Get some coffee.
- Yes.

1061
01:05:27,801 --> 01:05:30,895
Now, you just sit down,
and we'll get you something to eat.

1062
01:05:30,971 --> 01:05:35,101
- Miss Bragg kept something warm.
- Just sit down.

1063
01:05:35,176 --> 01:05:37,838
- Here's your coffee, Frisbee.
- Where have you been, Frisbee?

1064
01:05:37,912 --> 01:05:41,814
- Yeah, it's almost 4:00 in the morning.
- What happened to you?

1065
01:05:44,084 --> 01:05:47,918
- Come on, drink your coffee, Frisbee.
- Yes, here's the sugar.

1066
01:05:48,488 --> 01:05:50,012
Sugar, Frisbee.

1067
01:05:50,623 --> 01:05:52,523
No, no, that's salt.

1068
01:05:53,259 --> 01:05:54,988
Get another cup of coffee.

1069
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:58,757
Now, Frisbee, you left before dinner.
Where have you been?

1070
01:06:04,803 --> 01:06:07,294
- Not on the cake.
- That's mustard.

1071
01:06:07,371 --> 01:06:08,599
Here's some more coffee.

1072
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:12,268
ELFINl: Now, Frisbee, won't you please
tell us where you've been?

1073
01:06:19,016 --> 01:06:20,711
Wait a minute.

1074
01:06:24,021 --> 01:06:25,079
No.

1075
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:30,884
ELFINl: Oh, no.

1076
01:06:30,961 --> 01:06:32,087
No, no, no. Frisbee. Frisbee.

1077
01:06:32,162 --> 01:06:33,459
Have some toast.

1078
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:36,056
Please, tell us. What's the matter?

1079
01:06:38,569 --> 01:06:40,901
Please, Frisbee. Frisbee?

1080
01:06:41,805 --> 01:06:43,568
What is the matter?

1081
01:06:45,808 --> 01:06:47,503
What's the matter?

1082
01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:49,710
I'm in love! That's what's the matter.
I'm in love.

1083
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:52,476
I'm going upstairs
to propose to her right now.

1084
01:06:52,548 --> 01:06:53,572
ELFINl: Frisbee?

1085
01:06:53,649 --> 01:06:55,981
Thank you, gentlemen, for the food.
It was delicious.

1086
01:06:56,051 --> 01:06:58,178
- Frisbee.
- Well, good night.

1087
01:06:59,988 --> 01:07:00,977
Frisbee! Frisbee!

1088
01:07:04,226 --> 01:07:06,490
- Package for Frisbee.
- That's me. Thank you very much.

1089
01:07:06,562 --> 01:07:08,291
- Sign here.
- What was the delay, young man?

1090
01:07:08,364 --> 01:07:09,524
Just sign there.

1091
01:07:09,598 --> 01:07:12,260
- I trust the engraving is all right.
- I guess so.

1092
01:07:12,333 --> 01:07:15,166
Thank you. Just a moment. Here you are.

1093
01:07:16,069 --> 01:07:18,333
- Thanks.
- You're quite welcome.

1094
01:07:19,174 --> 01:07:20,801
ELFINl: Are you sure it's a real diamond,
Frisbee?

1095
01:07:20,875 --> 01:07:22,206
I'm certain that it is.

1096
01:07:22,276 --> 01:07:24,244
The ring cost me $83.95,

1097
01:07:24,311 --> 01:07:26,745
which didn't include the two dollars
for the engraving.

1098
01:07:26,814 --> 01:07:29,874
- Let's see it, Frisbee.
- I'm trying to open it.

1099
01:07:34,222 --> 01:07:36,315
- Here, you...
- Yes, I...

1100
01:07:36,757 --> 01:07:38,281
There it is.

1101
01:07:38,926 --> 01:07:41,190
- Lovely. Lovely.
- It isn't very big, is it?

1102
01:07:41,261 --> 01:07:43,729
- But it is in extremely good taste.
- Lovely. Lovely.

1103
01:07:43,797 --> 01:07:45,321
Frisbee, as a man of experience,

1104
01:07:45,398 --> 01:07:47,559
- I assure you that I like it.
- Thank you very much.

1105
01:07:47,633 --> 01:07:49,692
Here's the breakfast you ordered,
Professor Frisbee.

1106
01:07:49,769 --> 01:07:51,168
Thank you, Miss Bragg.

1107
01:07:51,238 --> 01:07:53,263
Room service. Now it's room service.

1108
01:07:53,339 --> 01:07:56,308
Elfini, would you please put the ring
under the toast cover?

1109
01:07:56,375 --> 01:07:59,037
- Why, certainly.
- Thank you.

1110
01:08:00,245 --> 01:08:02,941
- Well, goodbye.
- Good luck.

1111
01:08:03,014 --> 01:08:06,506
- Don't take no for an answer, Frisbee.
Be careful.

1112
01:08:12,189 --> 01:08:14,623
If I were the cream
for that woman's coffee, I'd curdle.

1113
01:08:14,692 --> 01:08:17,126
Miss Bragg, I thought you were leaving us.

1114
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:21,391
A nurse doesn't desert her post
when an epidemic reaches its crisis.

1115
01:08:24,735 --> 01:08:26,532
Come in.

1116
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:31,797
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Frizzy.

1117
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:32,899
I brought your breakfast.

1118
01:08:32,976 --> 01:08:35,706
Good. I'll have it right here. Thank you.

1119
01:08:36,881 --> 01:08:39,315
- How do you take it?
- Just jav, no cow.

1120
01:08:39,383 --> 01:08:41,112
- Just what?
- Black.

1121
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:44,746
- Sugar?
- Straight.

1122
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:49,623
- Toast?
- No, thanks.

1123
01:08:51,195 --> 01:08:53,686
You sure you don't want some toast?

1124
01:08:55,565 --> 01:08:57,760
- No toast, huh?
- Never use it.

1125
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:01,536
Not even a small bite?

1126
01:09:02,272 --> 01:09:05,435
- Sit down. Take a load off your feet.
- Toast.

1127
01:09:09,344 --> 01:09:12,245
That's a book I was reading last night.

1128
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:14,339
I couldn't sleep last night, either.

1129
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:18,614
I just kept walking and walking until
the sun came up over the East Sixties.

1130
01:09:18,687 --> 01:09:20,245
I had to have time
to gather my thoughts together

1131
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:23,416
and kind of clarify our relationship.

1132
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:24,823
You ever get one of those?

1133
01:09:24,893 --> 01:09:28,294
Yes, Miss Honey.
It's very important to me, too.

1134
01:09:28,362 --> 01:09:31,661
You see, it's new and rather strange.

1135
01:09:32,967 --> 01:09:38,098
Up until now, my life has been like,
well, like an un-orchestrated theme.

1136
01:09:38,739 --> 01:09:42,004
Say, you couldn't talk a little plainer,
could you?

1137
01:09:42,542 --> 01:09:45,102
Not unless you have a piece of toast

1138
01:09:48,915 --> 01:09:51,907
or at least look under the lid anyway.

1139
01:09:55,789 --> 01:09:58,087
You went and bought me a present.

1140
01:09:58,158 --> 01:09:59,853
I hope it fits.

1141
01:09:59,926 --> 01:10:04,659
I went all over town last night trying
to find a jewelry store that was open.

1142
01:10:06,032 --> 01:10:10,401
Now, isn't that sweet?
It's a lovely ring, really it is, Frizzy.

1143
01:10:11,203 --> 01:10:13,228
I had hoped you'd like it.

1144
01:10:13,739 --> 01:10:16,970
It's our engagement ring.

1145
01:10:19,677 --> 01:10:23,010
Frizzy, do you mean that...

1146
01:10:23,081 --> 01:10:24,378
Yes, I do.

1147
01:10:24,449 --> 01:10:27,748
- Do you mean you really thought...
- Well, I... Yes.

1148
01:10:30,654 --> 01:10:32,588
What am I supposed to say?

1149
01:10:32,657 --> 01:10:34,591
Why, just say yes.

1150
01:10:34,658 --> 01:10:37,889
After what you told me yesterday
the way you feel about me,

1151
01:10:37,961 --> 01:10:40,555
all you have to do now is say yes.

1152
01:10:41,232 --> 01:10:44,395
Frizzy, don't you think
you're being a bit hasty?

1153
01:10:45,335 --> 01:10:47,735
I'm just as surprised as you are.

1154
01:10:48,371 --> 01:10:51,738
Marriage. I always thought
I was married to my music.

1155
01:10:52,643 --> 01:10:56,079
I thought the only thing could stir me
was Piatigorsky on the cello,

1156
01:10:56,147 --> 01:10:59,878
Heifetz on the violin,
Toscanini conducting a symphony.

1157
01:11:00,449 --> 01:11:03,714
And then... Then you.

1158
01:11:05,421 --> 01:11:08,288
You see, I've had
rather a curious background.

1159
01:11:08,357 --> 01:11:11,451
I was graduated from Princeton
when I was 13.

1160
01:11:11,527 --> 01:11:13,392
When I was a year old,
I could sing Three Blind Mice,

1161
01:11:13,461 --> 01:11:15,190
and before I was three,

1162
01:11:15,263 --> 01:11:17,356
I knew that the major chord
on flattened supertonic

1163
01:11:17,433 --> 01:11:22,803
was D flat, F and A flat,
in the key of C, of course.

1164
01:11:24,106 --> 01:11:27,735
People like that... I don't know.

1165
01:11:28,643 --> 01:11:31,134
Dust just piles up on their hearts.

1166
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:35,705
It kind of took you to blow it away.

1167
01:11:36,851 --> 01:11:40,787
Yeah, but I didn't mean
to blow it smack into your eyes.

1168
01:11:41,822 --> 01:11:43,653
That's what happened.

1169
01:11:45,758 --> 01:11:48,249
Why don't you look inside the ring?

1170
01:11:51,296 --> 01:11:54,322
There's some writing. Musical notes.

1171
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,992
Yes. There wasn't enough room
for all the words,

1172
01:11:56,069 --> 01:11:58,094
so I used notes instead.

1173
01:11:58,171 --> 01:12:01,868
Notes from the opening phrase of an aria
from the opera Paris and Helen.

1174
01:12:01,942 --> 01:12:05,309
Quote, "O thou beloved,

1175
01:12:06,345 --> 01:12:08,745
"whom so long my heart desireth,

1176
01:12:09,549 --> 01:12:13,076
"when will the day ere be
that my heart thou doth bless

1177
01:12:14,487 --> 01:12:16,717
"with a softly whispered yes. "

1178
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:19,985
Unquote I suppose.

1179
01:12:23,029 --> 01:12:26,328
I hope you don't think it's too corny.

1180
01:12:29,166 --> 01:12:30,190
Oh, Frizzy, I...

1181
01:12:32,407 --> 01:12:33,396
Yes, come in.

1182
01:12:35,008 --> 01:12:37,442
Miss Honey,
there is a telephone call for you.

1183
01:12:37,512 --> 01:12:38,501
- For me?
- Yes.

1184
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:40,844
We hate to interrupt you,
but it is a long distance call.

1185
01:12:40,914 --> 01:12:43,405
The man on the wire said
it was from your daddy.

1186
01:12:43,483 --> 01:12:45,781
- Daddy?
- That's what he said.

1187
01:12:46,853 --> 01:12:50,152
My daddy. Oh, yeah. I'll take it right away.

1188
01:12:50,623 --> 01:12:53,023
- How did it go, Frisbee?
- Very well.

1189
01:12:53,092 --> 01:12:56,186
- She seemed quite overwhelmed.
- That was to be expected, though.

1190
01:12:56,262 --> 01:13:00,289
Excuse me, but the customary procedure
is to approach

1191
01:13:00,366 --> 01:13:02,061
- the parents of the young lady first.
- Oh, yeah.

1192
01:13:03,803 --> 01:13:06,271
- Hello.
- Hello, Honey, this is Monte.

1193
01:13:06,338 --> 01:13:07,396
The boss wants to talk to you.

1194
01:13:07,472 --> 01:13:10,202
Only we're relaying the call
so it won't be traced. Get me?

1195
01:13:10,276 --> 01:13:11,903
Here she is, boss, ready?

1196
01:13:11,977 --> 01:13:14,878
Okay, now, Honey,
don't use no names, though.

1197
01:13:20,752 --> 01:13:24,051
Oh, boy, did you call at the right minute.
Where are you?

1198
01:13:24,422 --> 01:13:27,880
A little one horse town in New Jersey.
Rancocas it's called.

1199
01:13:27,958 --> 01:13:30,085
How have you been, baby?
Everything under control?

1200
01:13:30,162 --> 01:13:33,620
Not anymore.
Things are getting complicated.

1201
01:13:33,696 --> 01:13:35,721
No, no, nothing like that.

1202
01:13:36,666 --> 01:13:40,397
It's just that one of the kiddies
has broken out in a rash.

1203
01:13:40,471 --> 01:13:42,234
Yeah, a slight case of spring fever.

1204
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:45,302
Well, don't let the old boy
run you down in his wheelchair.

1205
01:13:45,375 --> 01:13:49,675
Everything is set, baby.
I've got a Justice of the Peace all lined up.

1206
01:13:50,013 --> 01:13:53,107
That's what we're trying to figure out.
How to get you down here.

1207
01:13:53,182 --> 01:13:56,049
No, don't want you to take a train.
They'd spot you like a lead dime.

1208
01:13:56,119 --> 01:13:57,313
They'll be watching everything,

1209
01:13:57,387 --> 01:13:59,821
Holland Tunnel,
George Washington Bridge, everything.

1210
01:13:59,889 --> 01:14:02,255
I don't care if I have to hitchhike
out of here in a hearse.

1211
01:14:02,324 --> 01:14:06,055
I've got to get out of here.
I don't like it. I want...

1212
01:14:06,861 --> 01:14:11,321
Well, what other news is there, Daddy?
Everything fine at home?

1213
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:13,897
How's mom's lumbago?

1214
01:14:13,969 --> 01:14:16,802
- How's whose what?
- Home for her birthday?

1215
01:14:17,472 --> 01:14:19,963
Well, I don't know, Daddy.

1216
01:14:20,041 --> 01:14:23,533
I won't be long.
Just wait in the library, please.

1217
01:14:23,611 --> 01:14:27,206
If you don't mind, I'd like to have
a few words with your father.

1218
01:14:27,282 --> 01:14:29,341
Oh, sure.

1219
01:14:31,285 --> 01:14:35,278
Daddy, this is the professor
I was telling you about.

1220
01:14:40,328 --> 01:14:44,196
Hello, Mr. Swanson.
This is Hobart Frisbee.

1221
01:14:45,166 --> 01:14:48,624
I gather your daughter has told you
of our intentions.

1222
01:14:48,701 --> 01:14:51,067
Hey, what is all this double talk?

1223
01:14:51,136 --> 01:14:52,535
Before asking for her hand,

1224
01:14:52,606 --> 01:14:55,336
I realize I should have asked
your permission.

1225
01:14:55,408 --> 01:14:57,171
Please, Frizzy.

1226
01:14:57,243 --> 01:15:00,610
- Are you crazy?
- You're so right, Mr. Swanson.

1227
01:15:00,679 --> 01:15:04,240
I realize this must come
as a great shock to you.

1228
01:15:04,315 --> 01:15:07,375
One of these old dodos
has got a yen for Honey.

1229
01:15:07,785 --> 01:15:11,346
Well, speak up, son.
What have you got for to offer?

1230
01:15:11,423 --> 01:15:15,553
Well, as character references,

1231
01:15:15,627 --> 01:15:18,892
you may call the head
of the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia

1232
01:15:18,963 --> 01:15:22,262
and the president of Princeton,
that's my university.

1233
01:15:22,333 --> 01:15:25,598
Except for occasional trouble
with my left sinus,

1234
01:15:25,671 --> 01:15:28,162
I am in excellent physical condition.

1235
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:29,797
How's your digestion, son?

1236
01:15:29,874 --> 01:15:31,535
Excellent, sir. Excellent.

1237
01:15:31,608 --> 01:15:35,169
I draw a salary of $3,200 per year
and board.

1238
01:15:35,846 --> 01:15:40,749
It's not very large,
but we'll watch our nickels and...

1239
01:15:43,687 --> 01:15:45,052
Do I what?

1240
01:15:45,689 --> 01:15:47,589
Gamble? Oh, no, sir, I...

1241
01:15:47,657 --> 01:15:49,682
That's fine. That's fine.

1242
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:53,288
Adams, I think I've got a brain flash.

1243
01:15:53,696 --> 01:15:57,257
Son, what did you say
your first name was? Hobart?

1244
01:15:58,267 --> 01:16:00,064
Well, all right, Hobart.

1245
01:16:00,136 --> 01:16:04,004
I don't know whether Honey told you this
or not, but she's our only child.

1246
01:16:04,073 --> 01:16:06,132
Well, we hadn't figured
on having a professor in the family,

1247
01:16:06,207 --> 01:16:09,074
but if that's what she wants,
it's okay by us.

1248
01:16:09,144 --> 01:16:13,342
Well, I shall do everything in my power
to make her very happy.

1249
01:16:13,783 --> 01:16:18,117
One other thing, Hobart.
You see, we're not young anymore.

1250
01:16:18,186 --> 01:16:20,450
Her mother is an invalid,
and it would just about break her heart

1251
01:16:20,522 --> 01:16:23,389
not to see her Honey married.
You understand?

1252
01:16:23,757 --> 01:16:26,692
Of course, Mr. Swanson.
My own mother is dead,

1253
01:16:26,762 --> 01:16:29,993
but I realize what it would have meant
to her to be present.

1254
01:16:30,066 --> 01:16:31,499
Well, suppose you bring the kid
right down here.

1255
01:16:31,567 --> 01:16:32,556
We want to meet you,

1256
01:16:32,635 --> 01:16:35,900
and we'll have the ceremony right here
in our own hometown.

1257
01:16:36,137 --> 01:16:37,502
Of course.

1258
01:16:38,873 --> 01:16:42,832
May I call you Father?

1259
01:16:45,313 --> 01:16:46,940
Thank you, Father.

1260
01:16:47,015 --> 01:16:50,712
This is more than I hoped for.
Father wants to talk to you.

1261
01:16:51,952 --> 01:16:53,078
Yes?

1262
01:16:53,153 --> 01:16:55,348
Well, that takes care
of the transportation, baby.

1263
01:16:55,421 --> 01:16:58,788
Who's going to question the Curtis
Institute and Princeton University?

1264
01:16:58,859 --> 01:17:02,590
Oh, listen, to...
Daddy, maybe there's some other way.

1265
01:17:02,662 --> 01:17:04,493
I don't want to take him
for that kind of a ride.

1266
01:17:04,564 --> 01:17:06,657
It's quite all right. I'll take a few days off.

1267
01:17:06,733 --> 01:17:09,293
- Yeah, we all will.
- Excellent idea.

1268
01:17:09,369 --> 01:17:12,702
- Anyway, they don't have a car.
- We'll rent one. I can drive, I think.

1269
01:17:13,072 --> 01:17:16,064
Never mind the alibis, baby.
This gets you to Rancocas.

1270
01:17:16,142 --> 01:17:18,838
I don't want any arguments, understand?

1271
01:17:19,411 --> 01:17:20,571
Hello.

1272
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:26,238
- What's the matter, my dear?
- He's always in such a rush.

1273
01:17:26,318 --> 01:17:29,776
Father? Well, that's my good fortune.
The sooner the better.

1274
01:17:29,855 --> 01:17:32,619
Gentlemen, I have the honor
to announce our engagement.

1275
01:17:32,691 --> 01:17:34,818
Oh, good. Congratulations.

1276
01:17:36,862 --> 01:17:39,456
There, now, Miss Bragg, don't cry.

1277
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:41,555
I hope you're doing
the right thing, Professor.

1278
01:17:41,633 --> 01:17:42,964
I know I am.

1279
01:17:43,034 --> 01:17:45,662
Why don't you go upstairs
and pack some things for my fiancee?

1280
01:17:45,736 --> 01:17:47,601
- All right.
- Thank you.

1281
01:17:48,472 --> 01:17:49,769
I want to be an usher.
I want to be an usher.

1282
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,364
- We'll all be ushers.
- Yes.

1283
01:17:51,442 --> 01:17:52,807
One kisses the bride.

1284
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:54,902
- Yeah, we'll all kiss the bride.
That's right.

1285
01:17:54,978 --> 01:17:56,275
May we, Frisbee?

1286
01:17:56,346 --> 01:17:58,576
Go right ahead, gentlemen.

1287
01:18:02,085 --> 01:18:03,416
Thank you.

1288
01:18:03,853 --> 01:18:06,515
You've made us very happy. Very happy.

1289
01:18:08,690 --> 01:18:14,151
We feel that you are marrying
all of us a little.

1290
01:18:14,229 --> 01:18:15,787
Yes, we all do.

1291
01:18:17,332 --> 01:18:20,824
We wish you all the happiness
in the world, my dear.

1292
01:18:20,903 --> 01:18:23,098
Yes, yes. Yes, indeed.

1293
01:18:34,982 --> 01:18:36,847
Well, if we're going
to get started this afternoon,

1294
01:18:36,918 --> 01:18:38,510
I'd better get my things together.

1295
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,924
Kind of a cheesy picture of me, isn't it?

1296
01:18:55,001 --> 01:18:57,162
Now I know you better,
I'd say it's a little flattering.

1297
01:18:57,237 --> 01:18:58,795
- Check.
- Out of consideration

1298
01:18:58,872 --> 01:19:01,067
for Professor Frisbee, I'll let
you get your things together

1299
01:19:01,141 --> 01:19:03,541
- and get down the back stairs.
- And then you'll call the police?

1300
01:19:03,610 --> 01:19:06,602
No, that would be too humiliating
for Professor Frisbee.

1301
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:08,045
Just get out and disappear.

1302
01:19:08,113 --> 01:19:10,547
I've already made other arrangements.

1303
01:19:10,616 --> 01:19:12,140
Don't worry.
I'm not marrying any professor.

1304
01:19:12,218 --> 01:19:13,708
- You're certainly not.
- The guy I'm getting

1305
01:19:13,786 --> 01:19:17,847
is going to keep me in diamonds
and mink coats, not bungalow aprons.

1306
01:19:17,923 --> 01:19:19,948
That's pretty good for a gal
who came up the hard way, huh?

1307
01:19:20,024 --> 01:19:22,618
- We'll have this room fumigated.
- You can do that after we're gone.

1308
01:19:22,695 --> 01:19:25,061
- You're not taking Professor Frisbee.
- I'm taking all of them.

1309
01:19:25,129 --> 01:19:26,926
- Oh, you are?
- Oh, no.

1310
01:19:26,998 --> 01:19:29,398
Let me pass.
You're forcing me to phone the police.

1311
01:19:29,468 --> 01:19:33,029
Look, cookie. Any spilling
that's to be done, I'll do, but not yet.

1312
01:19:33,103 --> 01:19:34,365
Not while it'll bug up everything.

1313
01:19:34,439 --> 01:19:36,168
If you think I'm letting you
take my professors...

1314
01:19:36,241 --> 01:19:39,005
Look at it this way, cookie.
The harm's been done.

1315
01:19:39,076 --> 01:19:42,739
Frizzy's going to wear his heart in a sling
whether he finds out sooner or later.

1316
01:19:42,812 --> 01:19:45,576
Here or in Jersey
doesn't make any difference to him.

1317
01:19:45,650 --> 01:19:47,948
Only in Jersey is a darned sight
better for me.

1318
01:19:48,018 --> 01:19:49,815
- Better for you indeed.
- Oh, no.

1319
01:19:49,887 --> 01:19:51,821
- Let me through that door.
- No.

1320
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:53,448
Let me through that door, or I'll scream.

1321
01:19:53,524 --> 01:19:56,925
Oh, no, I can't have you screaming.
Sorry, cookie.

1322
01:20:22,351 --> 01:20:24,546
To be my lawful wedded wife,
for better or worse.

1323
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:27,019
- What did you say?
- What?

1324
01:20:27,088 --> 01:20:29,955
Nothing. I was just rehearsing
the wedding ceremony.

1325
01:20:30,026 --> 01:20:32,517
To be my lawful wedded wife,
for better or worse,

1326
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:33,959
for richer or poorer...

1327
01:20:34,030 --> 01:20:35,725
- Please, Frizzy.
- What?

1328
01:20:35,797 --> 01:20:37,094
Don't, please.

1329
01:20:37,165 --> 01:20:40,931
You're very nervous, darling, aren't you?
I know it's been a very exciting day.

1330
01:20:42,970 --> 01:20:44,870
Look out!

1331
01:20:49,209 --> 01:20:50,471
Frisbee!

1332
01:21:02,724 --> 01:21:05,386
Help! Help! Police!

1333
01:21:08,395 --> 01:21:10,124
Never mind, operator. Cancel it.

1334
01:21:10,197 --> 01:21:11,596
They must have left, Tony,
there's no answer.

1335
01:21:11,664 --> 01:21:13,154
They should have been here hours ago.

1336
01:21:13,232 --> 01:21:14,961
Not the way those old fogies
would be driving.

1337
01:21:15,035 --> 01:21:16,400
You know what's funny about people?

1338
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:18,335
The older they get,
the more careful they are.

1339
01:21:18,404 --> 01:21:19,632
You'd think when a guy's
seen everything...

1340
01:21:22,041 --> 01:21:23,872
Hello. It's Honey.

1341
01:21:25,545 --> 01:21:27,672
Hello, Honey. Where are you?

1342
01:21:28,313 --> 01:21:31,646
Now, look, we're not down here for fun.
We're having a wedding.

1343
01:21:31,718 --> 01:21:33,151
They've had an accident.

1344
01:21:33,485 --> 01:21:37,319
Nothing serious.
It just shook the old boys up a little.

1345
01:21:37,389 --> 01:21:39,755
I couldn't get to a phone before.

1346
01:21:40,993 --> 01:21:44,326
I don't know.
Some little hotel near Kingston.

1347
01:21:44,396 --> 01:21:46,364
Twin Oaks Inn it's called.

1348
01:21:47,164 --> 01:21:48,324
Yeah.

1349
01:21:49,801 --> 01:21:52,292
Sure, Tony, there's a midnight bus.
I can grab that.

1350
01:21:52,370 --> 01:21:54,133
Midnight bus. What are you talking about?

1351
01:21:54,205 --> 01:21:58,232
I'll have Monte and Joe pick you up
in 40 minutes. Yeah, tonight.

1352
01:21:58,309 --> 01:21:59,799
I've got a Justice of the Peace waiting.

1353
01:21:59,878 --> 01:22:02,142
There'll be a Justice of the Peace
tomorrow.

1354
01:22:02,214 --> 01:22:04,876
Why not do this thing right?

1355
01:22:04,949 --> 01:22:08,043
I want to wait until the old boys
have gone to bed.

1356
01:22:08,119 --> 01:22:10,349
I can't walk out on them cold.

1357
01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:12,918
Maybe you'd like to sit down
and knit them seven little sweaters

1358
01:22:12,989 --> 01:22:14,286
to remember you by...

1359
01:22:14,357 --> 01:22:17,554
I've told you how it's going to be.
Now stop barking orders.

1360
01:22:17,628 --> 01:22:18,890
So long.

1361
01:22:20,864 --> 01:22:22,491
Get the car ready.

1362
01:22:28,671 --> 01:22:30,434
Yes...

1363
01:22:30,506 --> 01:22:32,599
ELFINl: I can prove to you
by the laws of relativity

1364
01:22:32,676 --> 01:22:34,906
that it wasn't Frisbee
that ran into the sign post...

1365
01:22:34,977 --> 01:22:36,945
No?
- ... but that it was the sign post that ran...

1366
01:22:37,012 --> 01:22:38,639
Hello.

1367
01:22:38,714 --> 01:22:41,080
That's all right. Sit down. Go ahead.

1368
01:22:41,149 --> 01:22:44,016
But that it was the signpost
that ran into Frisbee.

1369
01:22:44,085 --> 01:22:45,677
Now let me explain.

1370
01:22:45,754 --> 01:22:49,713
If you do, by the same law,
your head will run into this bottle.

1371
01:22:49,791 --> 01:22:51,281
But before you do, I'd like a drink.

1372
01:22:51,359 --> 01:22:52,986
- All right.
- Yes, a drink.

1373
01:22:53,061 --> 01:22:54,619
And then, I think I'll hit the hay.

1374
01:22:54,695 --> 01:22:55,684
- Get some sleep.
- Oh, why?

1375
01:22:55,762 --> 01:22:57,491
Why? The evening is yet young.

1376
01:22:57,564 --> 01:22:58,690
Stay with us.

1377
01:22:58,765 --> 01:23:01,666
Oh, no, I don't belong here.
This is a bachelor dinner.

1378
01:23:01,736 --> 01:23:02,998
ELFINl: Well, but this is different.

1379
01:23:03,071 --> 01:23:04,629
No. That's the law.

1380
01:23:04,705 --> 01:23:07,503
We've heard from the garage.
The car will be ready in the morning.

1381
01:23:07,575 --> 01:23:09,975
Perhaps it will stay together long enough
for us to get to Rancocas.

1382
01:23:10,043 --> 01:23:11,908
Yes, we'll get an early start.

1383
01:23:11,978 --> 01:23:17,644
After issuing an urgent appeal
to all signposts not to charge at us.

1384
01:23:17,718 --> 01:23:20,585
What time shall we awaken you?
Around 7:30?

1385
01:23:21,621 --> 01:23:23,589
I'll be awake all right.

1386
01:23:25,624 --> 01:23:26,955
Well, kids,

1387
01:23:28,694 --> 01:23:30,218
here's to you.

1388
01:23:30,662 --> 01:23:31,959
ELFINl: Wassail.

1389
01:23:39,340 --> 01:23:40,932
Oh, Frizzy, I...

1390
01:23:43,844 --> 01:23:47,302
You know, you boys still have time
to warn him.

1391
01:23:47,381 --> 01:23:49,941
A man is a goof to marry any woman.

1392
01:23:50,718 --> 01:23:52,049
Just let them try and warn me.

1393
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:55,385
He'll have to console us that
there aren't six more just like you.

1394
01:23:55,455 --> 01:23:58,356
- One for each of us.
- Of assorted ages, of course.

1395
01:23:58,425 --> 01:24:00,052
Naturally.

1396
01:24:00,127 --> 01:24:03,290
I'd like to keep you all in a locket always.

1397
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:08,267
Seven squirrelly cherubs
right out of this world.

1398
01:24:10,770 --> 01:24:12,704
- Goodbye, kids.
- Goodbye.

1399
01:24:12,773 --> 01:24:15,640
Did you hear that, Frisbee?
I'm a squirrelly cherub.

1400
01:24:42,066 --> 01:24:44,091
ELFINl: Come now, Gerkikoff.
I can't understand...

1401
01:24:44,169 --> 01:24:45,431
Why? Because I know I'm right.

1402
01:24:45,503 --> 01:24:51,601
You're all speaking very glibly on a subject
about which you know practically nothing.

1403
01:24:51,676 --> 01:24:54,873
Frisbee, if you feel the need
of any guidance,

1404
01:24:54,945 --> 01:24:57,004
may I suggest that you turn to me?

1405
01:24:57,079 --> 01:24:58,910
That's right.
You were married once, weren't you?

1406
01:24:58,982 --> 01:25:02,247
Genevieve has been dead for some years,

1407
01:25:02,319 --> 01:25:06,415
but I have relived every moment
of our happiness so many times.

1408
01:25:06,490 --> 01:25:08,822
My experience is entirely at your disposal.

1409
01:25:08,891 --> 01:25:10,552
I'm very much obliged to you, Oddly,

1410
01:25:10,626 --> 01:25:13,151
- but I feel that this...
- Please, please, Frisbee.

1411
01:25:13,228 --> 01:25:17,665
Think of me as an older brother or father
anxious to send you off properly.

1412
01:25:17,733 --> 01:25:20,133
- ELFINl: Well, so are we all.
- Yes, yes.

1413
01:25:20,204 --> 01:25:25,301
Tenderness. That is what I advocate.
Tenderness and patience.

1414
01:25:25,374 --> 01:25:30,141
Genevieve was a pianist.
And we both dabbled at composing.

1415
01:25:30,212 --> 01:25:34,546
After our wedding ceremony,
we went straight to the Salzburg Festival.

1416
01:25:34,617 --> 01:25:38,144
We spent there a beautiful week,
filled with promise,

1417
01:25:39,855 --> 01:25:42,824
and returned home with three
excellent compositions for the piano

1418
01:25:42,890 --> 01:25:46,826
and a short nocturne for flute,
two horns, strings, and oboe.

1419
01:25:48,129 --> 01:25:54,932
Me, I remember for three months,
every time I bade her good night,

1420
01:25:55,002 --> 01:26:01,635
I'd kiss the palm of her little hand,
astonished at my own boldness.

1421
01:26:01,708 --> 01:26:06,668
Genevieve was a blond.
Here's a lock of her hair.

1422
01:26:08,381 --> 01:26:10,178
Well, it's lovely, Oddly.

1423
01:26:10,249 --> 01:26:13,514
I remember it used to shine a great deal.

1424
01:26:13,586 --> 01:26:16,248
There was a song at that time
everyone sang.

1425
01:26:16,321 --> 01:26:19,347
I always enjoyed listening to it.

1426
01:26:24,196 --> 01:26:25,527
That's it.

1427
01:26:27,901 --> 01:26:29,892
Please sing it all.

1428
01:26:29,968 --> 01:26:32,801
Oh Genevieve

1429
01:26:32,871 --> 01:26:34,133
Does anyone else know it?

1430
01:26:34,207 --> 01:26:37,040
Sweet Genevieve

1431
01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:40,341
The days may come

1432
01:26:40,412 --> 01:26:43,074
The days may go

1433
01:26:43,882 --> 01:26:50,014
But still the hands of memory weave

1434
01:26:51,188 --> 01:26:54,589
The blissfuI dreams

1435
01:26:54,659 --> 01:26:58,959
Of long ago

1436
01:26:59,029 --> 01:27:00,223
Please go on.

1437
01:27:00,297 --> 01:27:03,926
Oh Genevieve

1438
01:27:04,001 --> 01:27:06,060
Sweet Genevieve

1439
01:27:06,136 --> 01:27:08,070
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1440
01:27:08,138 --> 01:27:11,505
The days may come

1441
01:27:11,573 --> 01:27:15,339
The days may go

1442
01:27:15,411 --> 01:27:18,847
But still the hands

1443
01:27:18,914 --> 01:27:22,782
Of memory weave

1444
01:27:23,353 --> 01:27:27,221
The blissfuI dreams

1445
01:27:27,289 --> 01:27:31,658
Of long ago

1446
01:27:43,272 --> 01:27:45,672
It's good, it's good, good, good.

1447
01:27:55,817 --> 01:27:57,842
What did you make out
of what Oddly was saying?

1448
01:27:57,919 --> 01:27:59,546
Ask him, he's the expert.

1449
01:27:59,620 --> 01:28:00,712
What's his bungalow number?

1450
01:28:00,787 --> 01:28:02,152
Number six.

1451
01:28:24,210 --> 01:28:25,837
Oddly!

1452
01:28:25,911 --> 01:28:29,779
Oddly, I'm sorry,
but I've got to talk this thing out.

1453
01:28:29,849 --> 01:28:32,113
I'm all confused.

1454
01:28:32,183 --> 01:28:36,279
I'm glad we're here in the dark
because this is extremely personal.

1455
01:28:37,023 --> 01:28:39,583
What you said before about tenderness,

1456
01:28:39,658 --> 01:28:42,320
I mean, about your honeymoon.

1457
01:28:42,395 --> 01:28:45,922
Sounds like a beautiful
and aesthetic relationship.

1458
01:28:46,432 --> 01:28:49,560
But I'm afraid I don't trust myself.

1459
01:28:50,603 --> 01:28:53,663
I'm afraid I'm a lot bolder than you are.

1460
01:28:53,739 --> 01:28:56,765
Oddly, do you think
that would ruin everything?

1461
01:28:57,809 --> 01:29:00,243
Why, the very idea that I should
have to spend my honeymoon

1462
01:29:00,310 --> 01:29:03,279
watching her compose
nocturnes or sonatas.

1463
01:29:04,815 --> 01:29:08,046
I'm a man in love.
It's the first time in my life.

1464
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:14,247
I think of her every waking moment.
I want to take her in my arms.

1465
01:29:14,992 --> 01:29:20,794
If this marriage should have been delayed,
that is, should be delayed,

1466
01:29:20,863 --> 01:29:22,455
I mean, could...

1467
01:29:23,299 --> 01:29:26,200
Listen to me, Oddly, I'm all mixed up.

1468
01:29:26,269 --> 01:29:29,932
Can a man like that keep his mind
on Johann Sebastian Bach?

1469
01:29:31,406 --> 01:29:32,896
Oh, Frizzy.

1470
01:29:36,045 --> 01:29:38,775
What? I'm terribly sorry.

1471
01:29:38,847 --> 01:29:41,941
I don't know how I could have
made such a mistake

1472
01:29:42,017 --> 01:29:43,814
to say such things to a woman.

1473
01:29:43,885 --> 01:29:45,512
Don't apologize.

1474
01:29:46,788 --> 01:29:49,518
ELFINl: Frisbee?
Frisbee?

1475
01:29:50,927 --> 01:29:53,259
- Someone's calling me.
- Are they?

1476
01:29:54,863 --> 01:29:56,797
ELFINl: Frisbee, where are you?

1477
01:29:57,866 --> 01:29:59,857
Maybe it's just as well.

1478
01:29:59,934 --> 01:30:01,492
Oh, Frisbee!

1479
01:30:03,170 --> 01:30:04,660
I'll be back.

1480
01:30:17,183 --> 01:30:18,844
- Did you call me?
- Yes, Frisbee, we did.

1481
01:30:18,918 --> 01:30:21,409
- Frisbee, something came up.
- Oh, really, what is it?

1482
01:30:21,488 --> 01:30:24,548
- Well, you see, as we were sitting...
- Yes.

1483
01:30:24,624 --> 01:30:25,716
You better tell him.

1484
01:30:25,792 --> 01:30:27,657
No, no, I think he better tell him.

1485
01:30:27,727 --> 01:30:30,525
- Who?
- Well, you see, there's a gentleman...

1486
01:30:30,597 --> 01:30:33,862
I mean, a man is...
Four men...

1487
01:30:33,932 --> 01:30:35,524
- He will tell you.
- Yeah, he'll tell you.

1488
01:30:35,601 --> 01:30:36,761
I don't understand.

1489
01:30:36,836 --> 01:30:39,304
ELFINl: Well, come right inside,
and you'll understand.

1490
01:30:43,775 --> 01:30:45,402
How do you do?

1491
01:30:45,477 --> 01:30:48,776
- So, you're the bridegroom?
- Yes, this is Professor Frisbee.

1492
01:30:48,846 --> 01:30:51,337
- Hiya, Hobart?
- How do you do?

1493
01:30:51,415 --> 01:30:53,349
I thought you'd look like
the rest of these squats,

1494
01:30:53,419 --> 01:30:55,546
except for a beard with pea soup in it.

1495
01:30:55,621 --> 01:30:59,352
Squat? Well, what about me
evoked this interest on your part?

1496
01:30:59,423 --> 01:31:01,550
Sounds like it's engraved, don't it?

1497
01:31:01,626 --> 01:31:02,786
What's all this about?

1498
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:04,350
- It's about Miss Honey.
- Honey?

1499
01:31:04,428 --> 01:31:07,693
- Perhaps if we talked to him...
- No, we've had enough detours already.

1500
01:31:07,767 --> 01:31:11,066
Maybe you recognize the voice, Hobart,
or don't you?

1501
01:31:11,703 --> 01:31:13,261
How's the sinus?

1502
01:31:15,706 --> 01:31:18,698
Are you her father?
Well, how do you do, Mr...

1503
01:31:20,745 --> 01:31:22,804
You're getting warm. I'm her Daddy.

1504
01:31:23,981 --> 01:31:25,005
Shut up.

1505
01:31:25,082 --> 01:31:27,050
I believe I'm entitled to some clarification.

1506
01:31:27,118 --> 01:31:28,745
I would think so.

1507
01:31:30,121 --> 01:31:31,383
So am I.

1508
01:31:38,028 --> 01:31:39,290
Lipstick.

1509
01:31:41,865 --> 01:31:44,197
Here. Here. Here. You can't do that.

1510
01:31:44,267 --> 01:31:46,132
- No! No!
- Take it easy.

1511
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:52,062
I was kind of counting on Honey
to tell you the score.

1512
01:31:52,141 --> 01:31:55,076
The trouble with her is she's okay giving
out with the wise cracks and twists,

1513
01:31:55,144 --> 01:31:58,511
but when it comes to leveling off,
she gets chicken.

1514
01:31:58,581 --> 01:32:01,277
He's trying to tell us our wedding trip
was nothing but a vast lie.

1515
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:03,614
A vast lie. Don't you believe that, Hobart.

1516
01:32:03,686 --> 01:32:06,450
There's going to be a wedding.
Honey's going to be the bride,

1517
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:09,149
only I'm going to be the bridegroom.

1518
01:32:09,225 --> 01:32:10,624
Shake it off.

1519
01:32:11,327 --> 01:32:14,819
I'm very obliged to you guys
for delivering a hot cargo.

1520
01:32:16,831 --> 01:32:18,799
She had to be handled
with a lot of care.

1521
01:32:18,865 --> 01:32:22,028
Frisbee, it seems that your bride to be...

1522
01:32:22,102 --> 01:32:24,730
His bride? That's a laugh.

1523
01:32:24,806 --> 01:32:28,867
It seems that Miss Honey has used us
to circumvent the police.

1524
01:32:28,977 --> 01:32:30,945
I don't believe it.

1525
01:32:31,011 --> 01:32:32,774
Professor, you thought
she was going to marry you,

1526
01:32:32,846 --> 01:32:35,212
with your 3,000, what is it, a year?

1527
01:32:35,282 --> 01:32:38,115
She spends that much
having her toenails painted.

1528
01:32:38,185 --> 01:32:41,279
She sulks if she has to wear
last year's ermine.

1529
01:32:44,624 --> 01:32:47,024
He don't believe it. Look at him.

1530
01:32:47,593 --> 01:32:51,620
All right, Professor, suppose
you go tell Honey daddy's here.

1531
01:32:55,101 --> 01:32:56,898
Tony Crow's the name.

1532
01:33:07,879 --> 01:33:09,972
Professor Frisbee. Professor.

1533
01:33:10,049 --> 01:33:12,244
- Why, Miss Bragg.
- I hope we're not too late.

1534
01:33:12,317 --> 01:33:13,648
Have you married that girl?

1535
01:33:13,719 --> 01:33:16,916
You know, she knocked me out
nine hours in a closet.

1536
01:33:16,988 --> 01:33:18,319
Something told me all along...

1537
01:33:18,389 --> 01:33:20,789
Hold the phone, sister, hold the phone.

1538
01:33:20,858 --> 01:33:22,792
We traced you through your accident.

1539
01:33:22,860 --> 01:33:25,920
There's a warrant from the DA's office
for that girlfriend of Tony Crow's.

1540
01:33:25,996 --> 01:33:27,429
Where is she?

1541
01:33:46,683 --> 01:33:48,378
There's a Mr. Crow waiting for you.

1542
01:33:48,451 --> 01:33:49,543
Yeah.

1543
01:33:51,019 --> 01:33:54,284
The situation has been explained to me
in simple terms.

1544
01:33:54,357 --> 01:33:56,450
You needn't worry about the police.
I just spoke to them,

1545
01:33:56,526 --> 01:33:59,461
told them you had left an hour ago,
probably were in Trenton by now.

1546
01:33:59,527 --> 01:34:00,960
Thanks, Frizzy.

1547
01:34:01,029 --> 01:34:02,587
Thanks for what?

1548
01:34:02,664 --> 01:34:06,964
You've given us a fine course in
the theory and practice of being a sucker.

1549
01:34:07,034 --> 01:34:08,501
Perhaps it wasn't quite worthy of you,

1550
01:34:08,569 --> 01:34:11,800
choosing us as the subjects
of your demonstration.

1551
01:34:11,872 --> 01:34:13,737
Seven pushovers.

1552
01:34:15,009 --> 01:34:17,603
Like shooting fish in a barrel.

1553
01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:21,615
I didn't mean for you to get it this way.
Right in the face.

1554
01:34:23,717 --> 01:34:26,379
I've been trying to write you a letter.

1555
01:34:28,089 --> 01:34:30,023
Here are all my excuses.

1556
01:34:31,892 --> 01:34:33,757
The handwriting of a...

1557
01:34:35,161 --> 01:34:37,425
What would be your word for it?

1558
01:34:41,468 --> 01:34:42,958
A tramp?

1559
01:34:49,945 --> 01:34:51,173
Good morning, Miss Bragg.

1560
01:34:51,246 --> 01:34:52,736
- Good morning, gentlemen.
Good morning.

1561
01:34:52,813 --> 01:34:54,542
How about some nice hot breakfast?

1562
01:34:54,616 --> 01:34:55,605
- No, thank you.
- Not for me.

1563
01:34:55,684 --> 01:34:57,151
I've made Parker House rolls.

1564
01:34:57,219 --> 01:34:58,550
- ELFINl: I don't care for any.
- No, thanks.

1565
01:34:58,620 --> 01:35:01,748
Professor Oddly, you may have
some jam or apple butter.

1566
01:35:01,823 --> 01:35:04,155
I don't think so, Miss Bragg. Thank you.

1567
01:35:04,225 --> 01:35:06,716
What? Nobody wants any breakfast?

1568
01:35:07,561 --> 01:35:09,927
Miss Bragg, would you mind
very much, please...

1569
01:35:09,997 --> 01:35:11,157
Would you mind leaving us?

1570
01:35:11,232 --> 01:35:12,426
Well!

1571
01:35:13,734 --> 01:35:16,999
Flying Schmo's last

1572
01:35:17,338 --> 01:35:20,933
Forty lengths behind

1573
01:35:24,979 --> 01:35:26,742
Now, gentlemen, before
we attempt to go back to work,

1574
01:35:26,814 --> 01:35:29,112
I should like to say a few words.

1575
01:35:29,183 --> 01:35:31,674
You've all been very kind and very tactful.

1576
01:35:31,751 --> 01:35:33,616
Overly tactful, if I may say so.

1577
01:35:33,686 --> 01:35:36,246
Now, let's face it,
I made an ass of myself and I know it.

1578
01:35:36,321 --> 01:35:38,516
Oh, well, we all did, Frisbee.

1579
01:35:38,590 --> 01:35:40,251
Yes, but I was the lead donkey.

1580
01:35:40,326 --> 01:35:42,487
- Good morning.
Good morning.

1581
01:35:42,561 --> 01:35:45,689
Well, you've had quite an eventful night
last night, gentlemen.

1582
01:35:45,765 --> 01:35:47,596
At least, so we see by the papers.

1583
01:35:47,667 --> 01:35:49,965
It's cost the estate some $300,000

1584
01:35:50,034 --> 01:35:52,901
to have its name spread across
every tabloid in New York.

1585
01:35:52,970 --> 01:35:55,837
"Night club cutie hides out
in Totten Foundation. "

1586
01:35:55,908 --> 01:35:57,603
- And this one.
- Yes.

1587
01:35:57,676 --> 01:35:59,974
"Professor smuggles Honey
across state line. "

1588
01:36:00,045 --> 01:36:01,706
A Honey smuggler.

1589
01:36:01,779 --> 01:36:03,110
I'm sorry, Miss Totten.

1590
01:36:03,181 --> 01:36:06,617
For the aforesaid reasons, Miss Totten
has decided to discontinue this project.

1591
01:36:06,683 --> 01:36:07,707
What?

1592
01:36:07,784 --> 01:36:11,880
Don't do that.
One word, Miss Totten.

1593
01:36:11,956 --> 01:36:15,153
In your very understandable excitement,
a great injustice is being done.

1594
01:36:15,225 --> 01:36:16,385
I am the guilty one and I accept my...

1595
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:17,984
- We are all in this together.
- ... dishonorable discharge

1596
01:36:18,061 --> 01:36:19,085
without any protest,

1597
01:36:19,161 --> 01:36:21,755
but I don't believe the others should be
made to suffer for my misconduct.

1598
01:36:22,933 --> 01:36:24,366
My goodness, what's that?

1599
01:36:24,433 --> 01:36:25,923
What happened?

1600
01:36:27,138 --> 01:36:30,107
- Good morning, teachers.
- Yeah, good morning.

1601
01:36:30,508 --> 01:36:33,705
- Now everybody line up over there.
- Just like for a photograph.

1602
01:36:33,777 --> 01:36:36,473
With you, Hobart, in the foreground.

1603
01:36:36,545 --> 01:36:37,807
Come on, let's get going.

1604
01:36:37,881 --> 01:36:39,508
Get around. Get around. Go on.

1605
01:36:39,582 --> 01:36:41,516
- Faster. Faster.
- Keep moving.

1606
01:36:41,585 --> 01:36:43,450
Come on. Hurry up!

1607
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:48,048
All right now. Sit down,
everybody. Make yourself comfortable.

1608
01:36:48,123 --> 01:36:49,784
- Hey, Louie?
- Yeah.

1609
01:36:49,859 --> 01:36:52,293
Phone the boss and tell him
we got everything in cold storage.

1610
01:36:52,994 --> 01:36:54,484
How much longer
are we going to argue this thing?

1611
01:36:54,562 --> 01:36:57,998
- Now, come on, Honey...
- I said no, and no is no.

1612
01:36:58,067 --> 01:37:02,265
Listen, Honey, when I was nine years old,
I fell in love with my piano teacher.

1613
01:37:02,337 --> 01:37:03,361
She played classical.

1614
01:37:03,438 --> 01:37:05,998
- Now, you're not nine years old.
- I love him.

1615
01:37:06,074 --> 01:37:08,304
- She loves him.
- Yes, I love him.

1616
01:37:08,375 --> 01:37:11,606
I love those Hick shirts he wears
with the boiled collars.

1617
01:37:11,679 --> 01:37:14,614
And the way he always has
his coat buttoned wrong.

1618
01:37:14,681 --> 01:37:17,081
He looks like a giraffe and I love him.

1619
01:37:17,150 --> 01:37:21,382
I love him because he's a sort of a guy
that gets drunk on a glass of buttermilk,

1620
01:37:21,455 --> 01:37:24,822
and I love the way he blushes
right up over his ears.

1621
01:37:25,491 --> 01:37:29,518
I love him because
he doesn't know how to kiss. A jerk.

1622
01:37:30,631 --> 01:37:33,498
I love him, Tony,
that's what I'm trying to tell you.

1623
01:37:33,565 --> 01:37:36,557
I'll never see him again,
but I'm not gonna marry you.

1624
01:37:36,636 --> 01:37:39,332
Even if you fill me full of lead,
like you did your friend, Ernie Hart.

1625
01:37:40,472 --> 01:37:41,496
I told you, I was framed.

1626
01:37:41,574 --> 01:37:43,405
I'm beginning to have
my own ideas about that.

1627
01:37:43,476 --> 01:37:46,502
Hello. Yeah. Okay.

1628
01:37:48,114 --> 01:37:51,345
Louie just phoned, boss.
They got them on ice.

1629
01:37:51,416 --> 01:37:54,249
Well, this kind of changes things.
Come on, baby, let's go.

1630
01:37:54,319 --> 01:37:56,514
- Go where?
- Back to town.

1631
01:37:56,587 --> 01:37:57,918
What is this?

1632
01:37:57,990 --> 01:38:01,084
Well, let's call it
a sort of a shotgun wedding.

1633
01:38:01,159 --> 01:38:02,820
Say, what are you trying to pull?

1634
01:38:02,894 --> 01:38:04,987
Baby, you've been floating around
on a pink cloud.

1635
01:38:05,062 --> 01:38:07,530
I want you to take a good look
at your friend Frizzy,

1636
01:38:07,598 --> 01:38:10,965
then maybe you'll come back down
to Earth. Come on, let's go.

1637
01:38:15,005 --> 01:38:16,029
What's the set up?

1638
01:38:16,106 --> 01:38:20,099
Joe and Monte has got them in there.
This room over here is empty.

1639
01:38:21,911 --> 01:38:23,378
You wait here.

1640
01:38:26,482 --> 01:38:27,949
Hiya, boss.

1641
01:38:28,885 --> 01:38:31,012
Everything is under control.

1642
01:38:31,555 --> 01:38:34,023
Where'd you get all the people?
I thought there were only seven of them.

1643
01:38:34,091 --> 01:38:37,185
They wandered in.
Said they was musicians.

1644
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:38,591
Yeah, I recognize them.

1645
01:38:38,661 --> 01:38:40,595
What are hepcats doing
in a place like this?

1646
01:38:40,662 --> 01:38:44,291
Louie grabbed them.
- They said they was here to play music.

1647
01:38:47,403 --> 01:38:48,836
Hello, Hobart.

1648
01:38:48,906 --> 01:38:51,067
How... How do you do?

1649
01:38:52,642 --> 01:38:54,405
Okay. Hold them here.

1650
01:38:55,611 --> 01:38:59,547
Come on in and take a look, baby.
Maybe you'll change your mind.

1651
01:39:10,192 --> 01:39:11,352
Well?

1652
01:39:15,330 --> 01:39:17,924
We'll be in the room across the hall.

1653
01:39:21,369 --> 01:39:23,428
Can we make a deal now, baby?

1654
01:39:23,503 --> 01:39:26,028
Sure we can, brother rat.

1655
01:39:26,107 --> 01:39:29,008
Adams is gonna get a guy to marry us.
Bring him in as soon as they get here.

1656
01:39:30,910 --> 01:39:34,209
Knock off that walking, Hobart.
You make me nervous.

1657
01:39:34,849 --> 01:39:37,613
Hobart, will you sit down?

1658
01:39:37,684 --> 01:39:39,914
- I beg your pardon.
- Sit down.

1659
01:39:42,222 --> 01:39:46,249
There now, all we have to do
is wait for the all-clear signal.

1660
01:39:46,326 --> 01:39:49,523
We'll dismiss the class
right after the ceremony.

1661
01:39:50,063 --> 01:39:51,553
Did you say "right after the ceremony?"

1662
01:39:51,631 --> 01:39:53,622
That's what the man said.
He said that.

1663
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:54,792
You can hear, can't you?

1664
01:39:54,868 --> 01:39:56,699
Do you mean they're not married yet?

1665
01:39:56,769 --> 01:39:58,828
Why do you think
we're fooling around with these?

1666
01:39:58,905 --> 01:40:00,372
I don't know, why?

1667
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:04,069
A little trouble with Honey's vocal chords.
She wouldn't say yes.

1668
01:40:04,143 --> 01:40:06,373
"Wouldn't say yes. "

1669
01:40:06,445 --> 01:40:09,437
Gentlemen, I've been wrong.
This visit is no longer a mystery.

1670
01:40:09,515 --> 01:40:11,312
Apparently it requires
those guns leveled on us

1671
01:40:11,383 --> 01:40:12,975
to force Miss Honey to marry Mr. Crow.

1672
01:40:13,051 --> 01:40:14,075
ELFINl: You mean to say...
Yes, I do.

1673
01:40:14,153 --> 01:40:15,711
That explains everything.
I knew it.

1674
01:40:15,788 --> 01:40:17,187
I believe she loves me.
She really loves me.

1675
01:40:17,255 --> 01:40:18,517
No question about it.

1676
01:40:18,589 --> 01:40:21,217
Hey! Hey!

1677
01:40:22,093 --> 01:40:23,958
She loves you, she loves you not.
So what?

1678
01:40:24,028 --> 01:40:25,893
Well, don't you see?
I couldn't possibly permit Miss Honey

1679
01:40:25,962 --> 01:40:27,452
to marry Mr. Crow
under these circumstances.

1680
01:40:27,532 --> 01:40:29,727
- Don't you agree, gentlemen?
- Absolutely.

1681
01:40:29,801 --> 01:40:30,790
Shut up!

1682
01:40:32,269 --> 01:40:34,169
Now sit down. All of you. Go on.

1683
01:40:34,237 --> 01:40:36,501
- Just a minute. We...
- Sit down!

1684
01:40:41,544 --> 01:40:42,806
Hobart.

1685
01:40:50,753 --> 01:40:54,154
Here you are, Tony.
He can't hear any, but he can marry you.

1686
01:40:54,223 --> 01:40:57,454
Hello. I'm the groom and that's the bride.
Get going.

1687
01:40:57,526 --> 01:40:59,153
I can't hear you.

1688
01:40:59,662 --> 01:41:02,995
- I said I'm the groom...
- Too loud.

1689
01:41:03,065 --> 01:41:05,033
I'm the groom and that's the bride.

1690
01:41:05,101 --> 01:41:06,466
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

1691
01:41:06,534 --> 01:41:08,661
- Hello.
- And you, too, sir.

1692
01:41:08,738 --> 01:41:10,103
I presume you have a license?

1693
01:41:10,171 --> 01:41:11,968
Oh, yeah. Here it is.

1694
01:41:13,308 --> 01:41:14,935
I must have lost my glasses.

1695
01:41:15,010 --> 01:41:16,102
This is gonna be great.

1696
01:41:16,178 --> 01:41:18,703
Sure. The best part of it is, he's so
near-sighted, he can't recognize us.

1697
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:19,804
I've got them right here.

1698
01:41:20,348 --> 01:41:22,976
They don't look so big now,
them big musical brains, huh?

1699
01:41:23,050 --> 01:41:24,915
Not to me, they don't.

1700
01:41:25,753 --> 01:41:28,119
You gentlemen think you're big
because you have firearms,

1701
01:41:28,188 --> 01:41:30,918
because you know how to load them
and pull the trigger.

1702
01:41:30,992 --> 01:41:33,051
It would be very interesting
to teach you the contrary,

1703
01:41:33,127 --> 01:41:34,992
- wouldn't it, gentlemen?
- Button it up, understand?

1704
01:41:35,062 --> 01:41:36,962
Beg your pardon, gentlemen,
we hate to bother you again.

1705
01:41:37,030 --> 01:41:39,294
- Well, what you say, Hamp?
- What you say, Satch?

1706
01:41:39,365 --> 01:41:41,094
- Bubbles.
- Excuse us, Professor.

1707
01:41:41,167 --> 01:41:42,259
We got some more questions.

1708
01:41:42,335 --> 01:41:43,825
Maybe you could help us answer.

1709
01:41:43,903 --> 01:41:47,236
The first question is, "How did music
secure a great military victory?"

1710
01:41:47,306 --> 01:41:49,467
We couldn't see what music had to do
with winning a battle.

1711
01:41:49,542 --> 01:41:51,066
What you all doing,
having a meeting here or something?

1712
01:41:51,143 --> 01:41:53,373
- What's going on?
- More like a wake, maybe.

1713
01:41:53,445 --> 01:41:55,106
- Excuse us.
- Never mind. Sit down.

1714
01:41:55,180 --> 01:41:57,410
We got a nice lodge seat for you
right in the front row.

1715
01:41:57,482 --> 01:41:59,609
Well, I got over here first.

1716
01:42:15,935 --> 01:42:17,493
Mister...

1717
01:42:17,570 --> 01:42:19,504
Just call me Joe.

1718
01:42:19,572 --> 01:42:21,665
Mr. Joe, do you know anything
about music?

1719
01:42:21,741 --> 01:42:23,766
It's not one of my best points.

1720
01:42:23,842 --> 01:42:28,711
I never went in for that kind of stuff,
at least not very much.

1721
01:42:28,780 --> 01:42:31,749
Yes, well there was a question
put to the assemblage a little while ago,

1722
01:42:31,817 --> 01:42:32,943
which I would like very much to answer.

1723
01:42:33,051 --> 01:42:35,076
You don't mind if we talk, do you?

1724
01:42:35,153 --> 01:42:36,916
Just keep it funny.

1725
01:42:39,790 --> 01:42:41,883
Your question was
about music winning a battle.

1726
01:42:41,959 --> 01:42:44,951
- We'd just as soon skip it.
- No, no, no. It's a very interesting subject.

1727
01:42:45,028 --> 01:42:47,258
I believe the correct answer
would be The Battle of Jericho

1728
01:42:47,331 --> 01:42:50,926
in which music played a vital part.
A very vital part.

1729
01:42:51,001 --> 01:42:52,332
That ain't funny, Professor.

1730
01:42:52,402 --> 01:42:55,860
Well, I'm hoping it will be
in just a moment.

1731
01:42:55,939 --> 01:42:58,373
Are you gentlemen familiar
with The Battle of Jericho?

1732
01:42:58,441 --> 01:42:59,999
Yes, sure.
- Would you mind singing

1733
01:43:00,075 --> 01:43:03,374
- a few phrases to musicians, please?
- Sure.

1734
01:43:03,446 --> 01:43:06,210
Now, I'd like you to pay particular
attention to the meaning of the words.

1735
01:43:06,281 --> 01:43:07,509
All right, gentlemen. Please.

1736
01:43:07,583 --> 01:43:09,710
The meaning of the words.

1737
01:43:09,786 --> 01:43:12,277
Well Joshua fit the battle around Jericho

1738
01:43:12,354 --> 01:43:14,754
Around Jericho
Around Jericho

1739
01:43:14,823 --> 01:43:17,121
Joshua fit the battle around Jericho

1740
01:43:17,193 --> 01:43:19,093
And the walls come tumbling down

1741
01:43:19,162 --> 01:43:22,029
God knows then
Joshua fit the battle around Jericho

1742
01:43:22,097 --> 01:43:24,395
Around Jericho
Around Jericho

1743
01:43:24,466 --> 01:43:26,661
Yes, Joshua fit the battle around Jericho

1744
01:43:26,734 --> 01:43:29,100
And the walls come tumbling down

1745
01:43:29,170 --> 01:43:31,661
Good morning, sister Mary

1746
01:43:31,740 --> 01:43:34,140
Good morning, brother John

1747
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:36,369
I just want to stop and tell you

1748
01:43:36,444 --> 01:43:38,810
Just how I came along

1749
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:41,280
You've heard about good old Joshua

1750
01:43:41,349 --> 01:43:43,613
Well, he was the son of none

1751
01:43:43,684 --> 01:43:45,879
And he never stopped his working

1752
01:43:45,952 --> 01:43:48,853
Well, untiI his work was done

1753
01:43:48,923 --> 01:43:51,551
Joshua fit the battle around Jericho
Around Jericho

1754
01:43:51,625 --> 01:43:54,185
Hey! Break it up.
We don't want any whispering.

1755
01:43:54,261 --> 01:43:56,786
Well, I believe we've gone far enough,

1756
01:43:56,863 --> 01:43:58,490
and we all understand
the answer to our problem.

1757
01:43:58,565 --> 01:43:59,998
- Don't we, gentlemen?
Yes, yes, indeed.

1758
01:44:00,065 --> 01:44:01,657
Now, go on, get to it.
What do you want to do?

1759
01:44:01,735 --> 01:44:03,930
Well, I...
We would like to try a little demonstration

1760
01:44:04,003 --> 01:44:06,062
of the effect of resonance
and reverberation.

1761
01:44:06,139 --> 01:44:08,607
- I don't know nothing about it.
- Well, we'll try and teach you.

1762
01:44:08,674 --> 01:44:10,835
- Go ahead, go ahead.
- Thank you.

1763
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:12,309
Now, gentlemen,
suppose you play the piece

1764
01:44:12,378 --> 01:44:14,209
you were playing the other day,
as I came into the room.

1765
01:44:14,279 --> 01:44:17,544
- You mean, The AnviI Chorus?
- Yes, yes, yes, indeed.

1766
01:44:17,616 --> 01:44:20,642
- Wonderful, wonderful.
- Now, a...

1767
01:44:20,719 --> 01:44:22,619
- Can we play, too, Professor?
- By all means.

1768
01:44:22,688 --> 01:44:24,246
All of you please join in.

1769
01:44:24,323 --> 01:44:27,156
Now, our hope is,
in the words of Mr. Armstrong,

1770
01:44:27,226 --> 01:44:31,253
that this particular music
might send you out of this world.

1771
01:44:31,329 --> 01:44:34,298
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Would you sit down, please?

1772
01:44:34,365 --> 01:44:35,696
Yeah.

1773
01:44:36,768 --> 01:44:40,966
Perhaps you'll be
a little more comfortable right here.

1774
01:44:46,209 --> 01:44:49,508
All right, gentlemen. If we are all ready
now, I suggest that we proceed.

1775
01:44:49,580 --> 01:44:50,979
Ready.

1776
01:45:17,673 --> 01:45:20,141
- I chose the wrong piece.
You didn't send me at all.

1777
01:45:20,208 --> 01:45:22,642
- Me, neither.
- Yes. It was definitely the wrong piece.

1778
01:45:22,712 --> 01:45:24,236
I don't like that kind of stuff anyway.

1779
01:45:24,313 --> 01:45:26,804
I quite agree with you.
We must go the other way.

1780
01:45:26,881 --> 01:45:29,042
Isn't that true, gentlemen?
We must go the other way.

1781
01:45:29,118 --> 01:45:30,415
We must change our style.

1782
01:45:30,485 --> 01:45:33,010
- Can we help, Professor?
- That's an excellent idea, Mr. Dorsey.

1783
01:45:33,089 --> 01:45:37,116
Perhaps if we change our style to swing,
that'll help produce the desired result.

1784
01:45:37,192 --> 01:45:39,217
Hey, less talk and more music.

1785
01:45:39,294 --> 01:45:41,626
I'm sorry. I'd almost forgotten about you.

1786
01:45:41,696 --> 01:45:43,357
Just one more thing. As they are playing,

1787
01:45:43,431 --> 01:45:47,765
would you boys be prepared
to cut a rug for this gentleman?

1788
01:45:55,946 --> 01:45:57,243
- We dig it, Professor.
- We dig it, Professor.

1789
01:45:57,313 --> 01:45:58,337
Yes, indeed.

1790
01:45:58,414 --> 01:46:00,382
Now you're talking. That's more like it.

1791
01:46:00,449 --> 01:46:03,043
Yes, I thought it was pretty good myself.

1792
01:46:03,119 --> 01:46:04,177
What are you gentlemen going to play?

1793
01:46:04,253 --> 01:46:05,584
We'd like to try Flying Home.

1794
01:46:05,654 --> 01:46:07,246
- That's fine.
- Okay, Mel?

1795
01:46:09,824 --> 01:46:11,223
Flying Home.

1796
01:46:48,028 --> 01:46:50,121
That's better. That's fine.

1797
01:47:19,391 --> 01:47:21,222
Now repeat after me.

1798
01:47:21,293 --> 01:47:23,887
- I, Anthony Crow...
- I, Anthony Crow...

1799
01:47:23,962 --> 01:47:25,156
Louder, please.

1800
01:47:25,230 --> 01:47:28,324
- I, Anthony Crow...
- First class murderer.

1801
01:47:28,399 --> 01:47:31,425
- ... take thee, Honey Swanson...
- ... take thee, Honey Swanson...

1802
01:47:31,502 --> 01:47:34,300
Who hates and despises you, loathes you.

1803
01:47:34,371 --> 01:47:38,330
- ... to be my lawful wedded wife...
- ... to be my lawful wedded wife...

1804
01:47:38,410 --> 01:47:40,207
- ... for better or for worse...
- ... for better or for worse...

1805
01:47:40,277 --> 01:47:41,403
For worse.

1806
01:47:41,479 --> 01:47:45,210
...for richer, for poorer,
in sickness and in health...

1807
01:47:45,282 --> 01:47:47,512
...for richer, for poorer,
in sickness and in health...

1808
01:47:47,585 --> 01:47:48,643
I'm sick already.

1809
01:47:48,718 --> 01:47:49,878
- Now cut that out.
- What?

1810
01:47:49,953 --> 01:47:51,443
- Never mind. Go on.
- What'd you say?

1811
01:47:51,522 --> 01:47:52,750
Go ahead!

1812
01:48:11,874 --> 01:48:14,240
- Did you say something?
- No. It's that music in there.

1813
01:48:15,544 --> 01:48:16,841
...in sickness and in health...

1814
01:48:16,911 --> 01:48:18,401
- You just said that.
- What?

1815
01:48:18,479 --> 01:48:19,707
Shall I cut out that racket, boss?

1816
01:48:19,780 --> 01:48:21,407
Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

1817
01:48:21,482 --> 01:48:23,382
- Hey, where's he going?
- He's going to stop the music.

1818
01:48:23,451 --> 01:48:24,975
But he can't go. He's a witness.

1819
01:48:25,052 --> 01:48:26,713
He's got to remain here
through the entire ceremony.

1820
01:48:26,787 --> 01:48:29,813
Okay, Adams, forget it. Go ahead.

1821
01:48:29,891 --> 01:48:31,415
Now I forgot where I was.

1822
01:48:31,491 --> 01:48:33,118
Now I've got to start all over again.

1823
01:48:33,193 --> 01:48:35,218
This is going to take all day.

1824
01:48:35,295 --> 01:48:36,592
Begin where you left off.

1825
01:48:36,664 --> 01:48:38,131
- What did you say?
- Go ahead!

1826
01:48:38,198 --> 01:48:40,428
Not so loud! You hurt my ear.

1827
01:48:42,336 --> 01:48:45,134
- Now repeat after me. I, Anthony Crow...
- I, Anthony Crow...

1828
01:49:25,476 --> 01:49:27,569
ELFINl: Get his gun. Get his gun.

1829
01:49:31,715 --> 01:49:33,774
And do you Honey Swanson take this man

1830
01:49:33,850 --> 01:49:35,909
to be your lawful wedded husband,
to live...

1831
01:49:35,986 --> 01:49:37,886
No! No, I don't.

1832
01:49:40,457 --> 01:49:41,788
- Take their guns.
- Take their guns.

1833
01:49:41,859 --> 01:49:43,588
Take his gun away.

1834
01:49:44,161 --> 01:49:46,425
Hey, wait, I ain't finished yet.

1835
01:49:46,496 --> 01:49:50,865
I'm very glad of that.
Put up your hands, Mr. Crow. Put them up!

1836
01:49:57,174 --> 01:50:00,405
Now, Mr. Crow, we'll settle
our differences as man to man,

1837
01:50:00,477 --> 01:50:02,570
without the use of firearms.

1838
01:50:05,581 --> 01:50:07,014
Okay, Hobart.

1839
01:50:08,785 --> 01:50:10,514
Take it easy, Tony.

1840
01:50:21,797 --> 01:50:24,163
Atta boy, Frizzy, give it to him!

1841
01:50:25,066 --> 01:50:29,093
Sock him, Frizzy! Go on, hit him.
Atta boy! Give it to him!

1842
01:50:29,170 --> 01:50:34,540
Punch him! Give it to him!
Hit him hard! Hit him again!

1843
01:50:38,213 --> 01:50:41,808
Listen, you seven wise idiots.
It wouldn't work.

1844
01:50:42,850 --> 01:50:45,819
Remember, Frizzy, no women aboard.

1845
01:50:46,620 --> 01:50:50,681
Now, above all women,
you want to take a dizzy dame like me.

1846
01:50:50,758 --> 01:50:52,350
Now, if you will allow me,

1847
01:50:52,426 --> 01:50:55,259
I can cite many examples
of love stories from the operas

1848
01:50:55,329 --> 01:50:57,320
to prove the inevitability of this step.

1849
01:50:57,398 --> 01:51:00,526
Yes, I have proof even
from the older classics.

1850
01:51:00,601 --> 01:51:02,398
- From the laws of harmony.
- Yes, indeed.

1851
01:51:02,469 --> 01:51:03,834
And the laws of counterpoint.

1852
01:51:03,904 --> 01:51:05,735
The music of the masters
is sufficient.

1853
01:51:05,805 --> 01:51:08,365
Yes, indeed.
- That hasn't anything to do with it.

1854
01:51:08,442 --> 01:51:09,807
Yes, it has.

1855
01:51:09,877 --> 01:51:11,742
Gentlemen, I know
when words cease to be of use,

1856
01:51:11,812 --> 01:51:15,543
there remains but one argument.
Come here, Miss Honey.

1857
01:51:16,482 --> 01:51:17,813
Oh, no, Frizzy, please.

1858
01:51:17,883 --> 01:51:18,975
On the book, please.

1859
01:51:19,051 --> 01:51:21,849
But, Frizzy. It isn't fair.

1860
01:51:21,921 --> 01:51:23,218
Isn't it?

1861
01:51:27,159 --> 01:51:29,320
No, it isn't fair.

1862
01:51:29,394 --> 01:51:32,227
My goodness!
Hobart, remember my advice on...
