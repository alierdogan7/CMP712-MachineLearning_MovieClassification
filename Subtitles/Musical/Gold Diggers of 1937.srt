1
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:10,419
<i>Oh, baby, what I couldn't do</i>

2
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:13,824
<i>With plenty of money and you</i>

3
00:00:13,997 --> 00:00:16,989
<i>In spite of the worry that money brings</i>

4
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:20,261
<i>Just a little filthy lucre
Buys a lot of things</i>

5
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:24,203
<i>And I could take you to places
You'd like to go</i>

6
00:00:24,374 --> 00:00:27,309
<i>But outside of that, I've no use for dough</i>

7
00:00:27,477 --> 00:00:30,969
<i>It's the root of all evil
Of strife and upheaval</i>

8
00:00:31,147 --> 00:00:34,378
<i>But I'm certain, honey
That life could be sunny</i>

9
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:38,078
<i>With plenty of money and you</i>

10
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,054
All right, now, boys.

11
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:54,958
This afternoon, for our final session...

12
00:01:55,131 --> 00:02:00,433
...we will have with us Andy Callahan,
manager of the Good Life Agency.

13
00:02:00,603 --> 00:02:03,766
Introducing, Andy Callahan.

14
00:02:07,143 --> 00:02:10,601
Men, I've only got one thing to say.

15
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,940
Carloadings.

16
00:02:12,115 --> 00:02:14,015
Carloadings.

17
00:02:14,184 --> 00:02:16,379
What does it mean when I say
that carloadings...

18
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,113
...are up 16 and one-half percent
over last month?

19
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:21,519
What does that got to do
with life insurance?

20
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:22,715
Plenty.

21
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,258
It means there is no depression.

22
00:02:25,428 --> 00:02:27,623
Don't let your prospect talk about it.

23
00:02:27,797 --> 00:02:30,994
All you've got to do
is get him so enthused...

24
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:33,397
...over what life insurance
would do for him...

25
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,939
...that he can see himself
lying in his grave...

26
00:02:38,107 --> 00:02:40,940
...glorying in the physical comfort
of his family.

27
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:45,137
You can't sell insurance
sitting on your chairs in the office.

28
00:02:45,315 --> 00:02:47,044
You've got to get out and get it.

29
00:02:54,657 --> 00:02:57,455
All right, now, boys. Let's go.

30
00:02:57,627 --> 00:03:01,757
Everybody follow our song leader,
Rosmer Peek.

31
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,931
Where is Rosmer?

32
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,566
Come on, Rosmer.
Come out from wherever you are.

33
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:12,765
Rosmer, come on.

34
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,136
Rosmer.

35
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:18,706
<i>We want Rosmer.
We want Rosmer.</i>

36
00:03:18,882 --> 00:03:20,713
Now, Boop.
I'm gonna get someplace, see?

37
00:03:20,884 --> 00:03:23,648
When I left school,
I got this business to please my father.

38
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,380
I'm not cut out for it, neither are you.
Yes, sir, boy.

39
00:03:26,556 --> 00:03:30,458
I'm gonna get out of this insurance business
as soon as I get back to New York.

40
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,322
Peek. Oglethorpe.

41
00:03:32,495 --> 00:03:34,258
Come on, up and at them. On your toes.

42
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,557
That's the old pep.
They want you to sing.

43
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:38,360
I thought you cured them yesterday.

44
00:03:38,534 --> 00:03:40,195
So did I. Guess they had a relapse.

45
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,395
That's the old stuff.
Give them all you got.

46
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:45,803
All right, Andy,
we'll give our all for Good Life.

47
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:09,162
<i>You'll get pie in the sky</i>

48
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:13,200
<i>You'll get pie in the sky
When you die, die, die</i>

49
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:17,738
<i>If you buy, buy, buy life insurance</i>

50
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:21,809
<i>Lilies will adorn you
Relatives will mourn you</i>

51
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:25,311
<i>They'll be in the gravy
When you're in the grave</i>

52
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:29,440
<i>You'll get pie in the sky</i>

53
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:31,587
<i>Angels high all will cry</i>

54
00:04:31,754 --> 00:04:33,881
<i>Did you buy, buy, buy</i>

55
00:04:34,057 --> 00:04:36,025
<i>The Super Great, The Pearly Gate</i>

56
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,092
<i>The New York Colossal
The U.S. Old Fossil</i>

57
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:40,195
<i>The A.K. And A.Z.
The Knee-deep-in-daisy</i>

58
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,924
<i>Life insurance</i>

59
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,124
Everybody.

60
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:47,861
<i>You'll get pie in the sky</i>

61
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:52,133
<i>You'll get pie in the sky
When you die, die, die</i>

62
00:04:52,308 --> 00:04:56,438
<i>If you buy, buy, buy life insurance</i>

63
00:04:56,612 --> 00:05:00,139
<i>Lilies will adorn you
Relatives will mourn you</i>

64
00:05:00,984 --> 00:05:03,851
<i>They'll be in the gravy
When you're in the grave</i>

65
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,078
<i>You'll get pie</i>

66
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,891
All aboard.

67
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:14,829
The Jolly Maids.

68
00:05:14,998 --> 00:05:16,966
We should be called
The Fire Horse Brigade.

69
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:21,001
No company made a quick round trip to
Atlantic City since footlights were invented.

70
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,331
I must say it's very humiliating.

71
00:05:23,506 --> 00:05:25,303
I haven't got over it yet.

72
00:05:25,475 --> 00:05:28,933
Oh, dear,
I feel as if I were going to faint any minute.

73
00:05:29,112 --> 00:05:31,808
Save it.
There's no man around to catch you.

74
00:05:31,981 --> 00:05:34,575
I thought it was such
a pretty little show.

75
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,514
You didn't ever see the show.

76
00:05:36,686 --> 00:05:38,677
All you ever saw
was that moonfaced tenor.

77
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:41,349
Working for Herman
is like a student tour.

78
00:05:41,524 --> 00:05:43,719
I should be used to it, but I'm not.

79
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:45,087
Hello, Verna.

80
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,285
Hello, dear.

81
00:05:46,462 --> 00:05:48,191
I want my luggage, if you please.

82
00:05:48,364 --> 00:05:49,626
She wants her luggage.

83
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:51,562
Aren't you going back with us?

84
00:05:51,734 --> 00:05:53,031
Oh, dear, no.

85
00:05:53,202 --> 00:05:55,466
I couldn't think of riding
on that beastly train.

86
00:05:55,638 --> 00:05:57,469
I hate trains.

87
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,508
She hates trains.

88
00:05:59,675 --> 00:06:02,473
- Take them over to the car like a good man.
- Yes, miss.

89
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:05,045
Harry ran up for me, you know.

90
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:07,415
She'd wear that coat if it killed her.

91
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,847
Six months ago,
she was working for a seamstress.

92
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:12,817
- Now she's engaged to a broker.
- How'd she get such a break?

93
00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:15,287
One day, my children,
the broker ripped his pants.

94
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,482
The rest is history.

95
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:18,923
I've come to the opinion
she's got the right idea.

96
00:06:19,095 --> 00:06:21,563
- That's only way to get ahead.
- Work for a seamstress?

97
00:06:21,731 --> 00:06:23,858
Yeah... No. Be a gold digger.

98
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:27,264
Well, of course, a girl doesn't have
to be a gold digger exactly...

99
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:31,339
...but if she wants to be nice to a man
and takes a present or two from him...

100
00:06:31,507 --> 00:06:32,974
...in a nice way, I mean.

101
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:37,238
And men just love to give presents
to little girls and it's such fun.

102
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:39,005
I mean, opening packages.

103
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:41,673
Yeah, if y'all's conscience
don't jump out at you.

104
00:06:41,851 --> 00:06:45,844
Girls, from now on,
you're looking at a new Genevieve.

105
00:06:46,022 --> 00:06:48,650
A gal who starts with that old slogan,
"Get your man. "

106
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:52,158
<i>And ends with the old police slogan,
"Cherchez la femme. "</i>

107
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,386
What are you doing?

108
00:06:53,563 --> 00:06:56,054
I'm doing nothing in this world
but looking for a job.

109
00:06:56,232 --> 00:06:58,996
They don't advertise for chorus girls.
They just whisper it.

110
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,567
Nevertheless, I want a job.

111
00:07:00,736 --> 00:07:04,866
One where they hand you a pay envelope
every Saturday night and out comes money.

112
00:07:05,374 --> 00:07:06,466
Sounds interesting.

113
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,105
Oh, look.

114
00:07:18,387 --> 00:07:19,649
Look, girls. The gold rush.

115
00:07:19,822 --> 00:07:21,414
Get out your pick and shovel.

116
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:28,761
I always love men around me
when I'm hungry.

117
00:07:42,678 --> 00:07:44,646
Girls, we're saved.
Look what's getting on.

118
00:07:44,814 --> 00:07:46,304
Happy days are here again.

119
00:08:00,296 --> 00:08:02,696
I hope there's a fat man among them.
I like fat men.

120
00:08:02,865 --> 00:08:04,924
You can always outrun them.

121
00:08:05,101 --> 00:08:06,534
They're insurance salesmen.

122
00:08:06,702 --> 00:08:09,034
Whoever heard of an insurance salesman
with a dime?

123
00:08:09,205 --> 00:08:11,867
They have expense accounts
and we can get dinner.

124
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,736
I never did like starving.

125
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,071
- You coming along?
- No, thank you.

126
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:18,639
- You coming, Genevieve?
- Not me.

127
00:08:18,814 --> 00:08:20,679
I never yet found a worthwhile guy.

128
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,841
I'm going to explore the observation car.

129
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:24,179
I think I'll go with you.

130
00:08:24,353 --> 00:08:25,684
Well, good luck.

131
00:08:26,455 --> 00:08:28,116
- You all ready, girls?
Yes.

132
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,589
Come on, let's go.

133
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,460
I hope I find some kind of a boyfriend.

134
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:36,097
- Come on, girls.
Just get in, get in.

135
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,711
Hello. Hello.

136
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,615
What's the matter, Sally?
Open the door.

137
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,810
We're hungry.

138
00:08:57,987 --> 00:09:01,650
Well, it's stuck or locked or something.

139
00:09:01,824 --> 00:09:03,121
Say, can I help?

140
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,657
Oh, thank you.

141
00:09:04,827 --> 00:09:06,988
That's the kind of work I do.

142
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:11,564
Say, I'm afraid it is locked.

143
00:09:11,734 --> 00:09:14,897
Oh, dear.
We were on our way to the diner.

144
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:17,335
I don't want you to think
I'm fresh or anything...

145
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:19,940
...but if you'll sit down
and wait till I'm hungry...

146
00:09:20,109 --> 00:09:22,509
...I'll break that door down
and go in with you.

147
00:09:22,678 --> 00:09:25,044
Well, I hardly think I should.

148
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,177
There's no sense in your going back
when you come this far.

149
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:31,843
- Sit down, I'll tell you my story.
- Well, I might if it isn't too long.

150
00:09:32,021 --> 00:09:33,716
Come here.

151
00:09:40,896 --> 00:09:42,488
I hope y'all forgive me.

152
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:46,431
But sitting here with a strange gentleman
makes me feel terribly embarrassed.

153
00:09:46,602 --> 00:09:48,001
At home on the plantation...

154
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,004
...my daddy wouldn't think
of letting me talk to a strange northerner.

155
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,368
Northerner?

156
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:55,976
Honey,
didn't you know I was from the South?

157
00:09:56,145 --> 00:09:57,874
Why, that makes a big difference.

158
00:09:58,047 --> 00:09:59,446
Oh, sure enough, honey.

159
00:09:59,615 --> 00:10:01,674
What are we waiting for?
Come on, let's play.

160
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:02,943
I won't tell your pappy.

161
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:07,911
Well, if you ask me, I don't see why
J.J. Wanted us to come down here...

162
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,923
<i>...and catch a turkey
like that Jolly Maids.</i>

163
00:10:11,093 --> 00:10:14,119
We've got shows of our own just as bad.

164
00:10:15,564 --> 00:10:18,158
Well, I'm going in and get some dinner.

165
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:20,097
You coming?

166
00:10:32,615 --> 00:10:34,515
Oh, dear, stupid of me, isn't it?

167
00:10:34,684 --> 00:10:36,743
Not at all. I'm afraid it's me.

168
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:39,451
I'm looking for the diner.
Is it down this way?

169
00:10:39,622 --> 00:10:42,716
No, no, this is the last car,
so it must be up the other way...

170
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:43,984
...unless we've lost it.

171
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,993
Oh, goodness.
I'm afraid I'll never be able to find it.

172
00:10:47,163 --> 00:10:49,028
Well, may I show you?

173
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:51,223
Oh, would you? Thank you so much.

174
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,890
And your friend?

175
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,560
Oh, me? Oh, I'm not hungry.

176
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:27,626
Oh!

177
00:11:27,903 --> 00:11:29,029
Oh, was this your paper?

178
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:31,635
Well, it was.

179
00:11:31,807 --> 00:11:34,605
I'm so sorry. I didn't see you under it.

180
00:11:35,044 --> 00:11:36,773
Well, weren't the feet hanging out?

181
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,914
Oh, yes. I'm a little shortsighted.

182
00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:40,981
Oh, is that so? That's too bad.

183
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,880
I had trouble with my eyes
about 10 years ago.

184
00:11:44,053 --> 00:11:46,783
Really? When you were just a boy.

185
00:11:47,656 --> 00:11:50,682
Well, not exactly a boy.

186
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,488
You will forgive me for disturbing you,
won't you?

187
00:11:53,662 --> 00:11:54,686
Why, of course.

188
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:58,732
And you will go right on with your nap just
as if nothing ever happened, won't you?

189
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:03,770
Well, as a matter of fact,
I don't feel like napping just now, Miss...

190
00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:06,271
Larkin. Genevieve Larkin.

191
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:07,704
Isn't that a terrible name?

192
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:10,812
I always wanted to be called
something like Jewela or Carmen...

193
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,538
...or something sweet like that.

194
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:14,376
But Mother thought that...

195
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,778
Poor Mother.

196
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:18,249
She thought
Genevieve would protect me better.

197
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,551
Poor, dear Mother,
she was always worrying about me.

198
00:12:21,724 --> 00:12:23,453
And she's gone?

199
00:12:23,626 --> 00:12:25,150
Yes. And father too.

200
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:28,490
There, there.
You mustn't dwell on such things.

201
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:32,628
Oh, I can't help it.
It just seems sometimes that life's empty.

202
00:12:32,802 --> 00:12:35,703
Well, you must get new interests,
new friends.

203
00:12:35,871 --> 00:12:38,135
I've tried, I've tried.

204
00:12:38,307 --> 00:12:39,774
Well, perhaps I could help you.

205
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:40,966
Oh, could you?

206
00:12:41,143 --> 00:12:43,771
Could you with psychology
or something like that?

207
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:46,676
Well, not exactly that.

208
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,682
Oh, you're so awfully kind, mister...

209
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:53,081
Isn't this terrible?
Here I am talking to you like this...

210
00:12:53,255 --> 00:12:56,850
...unburdening myself,
and I don't even know your name.

211
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:00,826
Morty Wethered, Miss Larkin,
and it isn't terrible at all.

212
00:13:00,996 --> 00:13:02,930
It's done every day.

213
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:04,588
Dinner is now being served.

214
00:13:06,235 --> 00:13:08,635
Dinner now being served.

215
00:13:08,804 --> 00:13:10,999
Will you take dinner with me,
Miss Larkin?

216
00:13:11,173 --> 00:13:12,970
Oh, I'd be delighted.

217
00:13:13,142 --> 00:13:14,769
Thank you.

218
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,075
First call for dinner.

219
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,718
First call for dinner.

220
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,251
Come on.

221
00:13:29,425 --> 00:13:31,120
First call for dinner.

222
00:13:33,662 --> 00:13:35,186
Hey, back there, wait a minute.

223
00:13:35,364 --> 00:13:37,764
Well, boys, there must be more
where they came from.

224
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:40,595
Time's up. Come on, let's go.

225
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,032
There's one left over.

226
00:13:43,205 --> 00:13:44,695
Hi, baby. Wowie, she's mine.

227
00:13:44,874 --> 00:13:46,569
She's mine, I saw her first.

228
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:47,800
Hey, wait. Come here.

229
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:49,968
Come on.
Hey, wait for me, will you?

230
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:55,073
- Wait, wait.
- Just a minute. Why hurry?

231
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,085
- Lady, you're next.
- Excuse me.

232
00:14:04,226 --> 00:14:06,194
Hey, wait a minute.

233
00:14:07,296 --> 00:14:08,558
- Oh.
- Hello.

234
00:14:08,731 --> 00:14:09,959
Hello.

235
00:14:10,132 --> 00:14:11,565
I came in.

236
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:14,066
No, you didn't.
You couldn't, the door's locked.

237
00:14:14,236 --> 00:14:15,760
Oh, yes, I'm here. I can tell.

238
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,202
Oh, now, don't be so positive.
I don't see a soul.

239
00:14:18,374 --> 00:14:19,898
I see you're not shaving, either.

240
00:14:20,075 --> 00:14:22,009
No. You got me in this lather.

241
00:14:22,177 --> 00:14:23,371
Catch on?

242
00:14:23,546 --> 00:14:26,379
I guess I owe you an apology
for bursting in like this.

243
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:28,312
It seems that some men
were chasing me.

244
00:14:28,484 --> 00:14:30,315
What for? Oh, I mean, were they?

245
00:14:30,486 --> 00:14:31,510
Yeah.

246
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:33,814
Well, thanks for the refuge.

247
00:14:33,989 --> 00:14:36,480
You can't get out.
The door's still locked.

248
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:38,627
- Is it really?
- Yeah, come in and sit down.

249
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,456
I'll call and get the porter
and get a pass key, huh?

250
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,662
Is this being done in the best families?

251
00:14:43,832 --> 00:14:46,096
- You're one of the Boston Bluntzingtons?
- Oh, no.

252
00:14:46,268 --> 00:14:47,292
Well, then sit down.

253
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,993
It's comfortable there. Sit down.

254
00:14:49,171 --> 00:14:50,638
All right.

255
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:51,864
Begin at the beginning.

256
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:55,374
Name, age, weight, height,
and occupation.

257
00:14:55,544 --> 00:14:56,875
Name: Norma.

258
00:14:57,046 --> 00:14:59,674
Age: You can see I'm just a baby.

259
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:01,247
Weight: I won't discuss.

260
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:02,975
Height...

261
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:05,944
There's a spot over here
you just missed.

262
00:15:06,121 --> 00:15:08,021
Oh, and you're just the right height too.

263
00:15:09,758 --> 00:15:11,225
Well, I guess I better be going.

264
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:14,794
Say, the light's kind of bad in here.
Do you see any more spots?

265
00:15:14,964 --> 00:15:15,988
Yes, I do.

266
00:15:16,465 --> 00:15:17,727
Now, no, not that one, now.

267
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,231
Wait a minute. That's my pet.

268
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:21,961
I'm saving that. I mean here.

269
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,539
- Where did you just come from?
- Fresh from the chorus.

270
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:29,303
You mean, you do time steps
and buck routines and all that stuff?

271
00:15:29,478 --> 00:15:31,946
- Uh-huh. I've been at it for three years...
- I know.

272
00:15:32,114 --> 00:15:33,240
- You never lost a spangle.
- Yeah.

273
00:15:33,415 --> 00:15:35,144
- Ouch.
- A little stiff.

274
00:15:35,317 --> 00:15:36,579
You like that kind of work?

275
00:15:36,752 --> 00:15:38,014
No, I don't.

276
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,984
I'm looking for a job right now.

277
00:15:40,155 --> 00:15:41,486
What kind of a job?

278
00:15:41,657 --> 00:15:44,785
Oh, there must be someplace
where you work and get paid for it.

279
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,087
Say, maybe I can fix that.

280
00:15:47,262 --> 00:15:49,025
Yeah, look.

281
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:50,756
Here's my card.

282
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:52,195
Rosmer Peek. That's me.

283
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,165
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

284
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:56,634
I'm ace salesman
for Good Life Insurance Company.

285
00:15:56,805 --> 00:16:01,037
Anything I say around the plant goes. Give
this to Mr. Callahan, he'll give you a job.

286
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,201
- You're nice to do this.
- That's all right.

287
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,574
- One good turn deserves another.
- What did I do?

288
00:16:05,748 --> 00:16:09,081
Well, that close shave you gave me
was kind of nice.

289
00:16:09,251 --> 00:16:11,651
Well, I guess I better be going.

290
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,482
Would you like a little drink,
for good luck or something?

291
00:16:14,657 --> 00:16:16,249
- No, thank you.
- Come on, have one.

292
00:16:16,425 --> 00:16:18,859
Come on, you'll hurt my feelings.
These are martinis.

293
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:23,021
You don't have to be afraid of the gin.
I made them myself fresh last night.

294
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:25,091
There you are.

295
00:16:26,101 --> 00:16:27,693
You got a cute face.

296
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,101
I mean, you had a cute face.
What's the matter?

297
00:16:32,274 --> 00:16:35,971
That's awfully good, but I guess
I'm just not a drinking woman.

298
00:16:37,446 --> 00:16:39,311
Goodbye now.

299
00:16:45,054 --> 00:16:47,022
Oh! Wrong bottle.

300
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:49,054
Darn that Boop and his sauerkraut juice.

301
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,358
Life insurance.
What's life insurance got to do with you?

302
00:16:58,534 --> 00:17:00,058
- Well, it's a job.
- Lf you get it.

303
00:17:00,235 --> 00:17:03,500
When they start passing out jobs
in washrooms, a new day has dawned.

304
00:17:03,672 --> 00:17:04,696
It was an accident.

305
00:17:04,873 --> 00:17:06,773
I came along
so there won't be accidents.

306
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,603
Well, here's the battlefield.

307
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,479
Well, they not only need a stenographer,
they need a whole staff.

308
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,117
Maybe we shouldn't have come in.

309
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,846
You didn't expect them to come to you,
did you? Hello.

310
00:17:20,756 --> 00:17:22,747
Hello?

311
00:17:23,192 --> 00:17:24,750
Hello.

312
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,457
- Good morning.
Good morning.

313
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:29,028
- Are you Mr. Callahan?
- Right. Just call me Andy.

314
00:17:29,198 --> 00:17:32,861
I have a card here from your ace salesman.
He said you needed a stenographer.

315
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:36,903
- Oh, so Rosmer is my ace salesman?
- Well, that's what he told me.

316
00:17:37,072 --> 00:17:40,564
You're the only person he's sold since
he's been in the office. Do you type?

317
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,975
It's not one of the things I do best.

318
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,612
I'm the one applying, remember?

319
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,146
- Oh, experienced?
- Well, I...

320
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,716
She's modest
but the best stenographer in New York.

321
00:17:49,885 --> 00:17:51,250
I see. Started in the cradle.

322
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,684
Well, I've tried out a lot of girls
around here...

323
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:56,416
...but none of them had any zip
for an insurance agency.

324
00:17:56,592 --> 00:17:58,890
- You've got it.
- And I'm gonna keep it.

325
00:17:59,061 --> 00:18:01,495
Norma, I don't think
this is the right place for you.

326
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,655
Well, I'm sure it will be all right
if Mr. Callahan will have me.

327
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,323
Okay. We'll give you a whirl.

328
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,868
Salary's 22.50 a week.

329
00:18:09,905 --> 00:18:11,702
- Goodbye, Norma.
Goodbye.

330
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,505
Don't forget next Tuesday.

331
00:18:13,976 --> 00:18:18,072
- What do you mean?
- When we take our last jujitsu lesson.

332
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,409
- Do you know how to run a switchboard?
- Yes.

333
00:18:23,585 --> 00:18:27,077
Good. Just make yourself at home
and I'll show you around later.

334
00:18:27,422 --> 00:18:29,083
"The good life keeps rolling along. "

335
00:18:29,258 --> 00:18:30,282
- Remember that.
- Yes.

336
00:18:30,459 --> 00:18:33,895
- And "life insurance is immortal. " Got it?
- Oh, yes.

337
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,650
Got any more martinis?

338
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:08,460
- Well, hello.
- Hello.

339
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,654
Isn't that funny?

340
00:19:09,832 --> 00:19:12,699
I just gave my secretary a letter
to the boss. Mr. Callahan.

341
00:19:12,868 --> 00:19:15,803
I said, "There's a girl coming
and I want you to give her a job.

342
00:19:15,971 --> 00:19:17,370
She'd be great. Got blue eyes.

343
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:18,563
She's as good as in. "

344
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,298
Has the boss read the letter yet?

345
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:23,069
Oh, oh. Well, I've been awfully busy.

346
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,008
Somebody read your mind then,
because...

347
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,579
P.S. She got the job.

348
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,238
Really? You're gonna work here?

349
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,884
Oh, that's swell. That's swell.

350
00:19:30,052 --> 00:19:33,146
That's fine. I guess
Mr. Callahan heard me dictate the letter.

351
00:19:33,322 --> 00:19:37,418
Oh, yes. I distinctly remember him saying
something about his ace salesman.

352
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,352
Yeah, yeah.

353
00:19:39,528 --> 00:19:41,689
Yeah, well, that's me. Yeah.

354
00:19:41,864 --> 00:19:44,059
Well, it's nice weather, isn't it, huh?

355
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:47,396
- No, it isn't. It's raining out.
- I'm glad you're gonna work here.

356
00:19:47,736 --> 00:19:49,636
- I better get it done.
- No, wait a minute.

357
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:51,898
I wanna talk to you. Sit down.

358
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:56,136
Well, go ahead and talk.

359
00:19:56,311 --> 00:19:58,176
Yeah, yeah, well, I thought, maybe...

360
00:19:58,347 --> 00:19:59,371
You see, I...

361
00:19:59,548 --> 00:20:01,948
Yeah, and very true.

362
00:20:02,651 --> 00:20:06,712
- It's still raining though, isn't it?
- Oh, speaking of the weather again, huh?

363
00:20:11,894 --> 00:20:13,156
Speaking of the weather...

364
00:20:13,996 --> 00:20:15,861
Speaking of the weather...

365
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:22,693
<i>Speakin' of the weather
It isn't the humidity, it's you</i>

366
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:25,567
<i>Come donner, come blitzen</i>

367
00:20:25,741 --> 00:20:28,301
<i>Come pitter or pat</i>

368
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,139
<i>What in thunder is thunder</i>

369
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:34,009
<i>Compared to my heart
When it beats like that?</i>

370
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,043
<i>Speakin' of the weather</i>

371
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:39,744
<i>Speakin' of the thunder</i>

372
00:20:39,922 --> 00:20:42,288
<i>Speakin' of the lightning
It's frightening, dear</i>

373
00:20:42,457 --> 00:20:45,051
<i>What your eyes can do</i>

374
00:20:45,227 --> 00:20:46,819
<i>Let the heavens crash</i>

375
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,292
<i>Zoom and swirl</i>

376
00:20:48,463 --> 00:20:49,589
<i>Let it flash</i>

377
00:20:49,765 --> 00:20:50,925
<i>Boy meets girl</i>

378
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:52,532
<i>Speakin' of the weather</i>

379
00:20:52,701 --> 00:20:53,827
<i>Good old weather</i>

380
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,094
<i>Ain't it lovely weather?</i>

381
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,728
<i>And, incidentally, I love you</i>

382
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,508
<i>Pardon me, miss
Do you belong to this umbrella?</i>

383
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,203
<i>Pardon me, miss
It matches your eyes</i>

384
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,508
<i>Speaking of eyes
If they belong to this umbrella</i>

385
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:13,849
<i>They should be sheltered at once
From those threatening skies</i>

386
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,991
<i>Speaking of skies
And the storm in view</i>

387
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:20,788
<i>If that's your conversation,
I've some work to do</i>

388
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,928
Oh, so thou would'st
forbid me speak, eh?

389
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,124
About the weather?

390
00:21:26,301 --> 00:21:28,462
- Aye.
- Nay.

391
00:21:29,404 --> 00:21:31,235
But the hour is noon, thy work is done.

392
00:21:31,406 --> 00:21:33,237
It may be noon, but it's just begun.

393
00:21:33,408 --> 00:21:36,639
Pray let me speak,
whil'st thou fiddlest the keys.

394
00:21:36,812 --> 00:21:40,270
Speak if thou must, but softly, please.

395
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:43,274
<i>Speakin' of the weather</i>

396
00:21:43,452 --> 00:21:46,012
<i>Speakin' of the weather</i>

397
00:21:46,188 --> 00:21:47,621
<i>Speakin' of the weather</i>

398
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:51,725

00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,691
<i>Come donner, come blitzen</i>

400
00:21:54,863 --> 00:21:57,627
<i>Come pitter or pat</i>

401
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:00,529
<i>Your nose loves the raindrops</i>

402
00:22:00,702 --> 00:22:03,728
<i>Your nose knows the rose
Always grows from that</i>

403
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:06,703
<i>Speakin' of the weather</i>

404
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,502
<i>Speakin' of the thunder</i>

405
00:22:09,711 --> 00:22:12,145
<i>And speakin' of the lightning
It's frightening, dear</i>

406
00:22:12,314 --> 00:22:14,782
<i>What your eyes can do</i>

407
00:22:15,183 --> 00:22:18,243
<i>Let the heavens crash, zoom, and swirl</i>

408
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,752

<i>A boy meets girl</i>

410
00:22:30,665 --> 00:22:33,634
<i>Speakin' of the weather

411
00:22:33,802 --> 00:22:35,429
<i>Ain't it lovely weather?</i>

00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:42,168
<i>And, incidentally, I love you</i>

413
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,444
And what is this?

414
00:22:54,923 --> 00:22:57,585
- We were just speaking about the weather.
- Fun's fun but...

415
00:22:57,759 --> 00:22:59,727
Yeah, I know,
"Life insurance is immortal. "

416
00:22:59,895 --> 00:23:01,487
- Miss...
- Perry. Norma Perry.

417
00:23:01,663 --> 00:23:03,893
I'm terribly sorry.

418
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,101
Rosmer,
you can't sell insurance this way.

419
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:08,293
Or any other way.

420
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,630
Optimism's what you need.

421
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,067
- Do or die.
- Sink or swim.

422
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:13,673
- Strike while the iron's hot.
- Insurance can be sold.

423
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:16,640
- Statistics prove it.
- Now you're getting the idea, come on.

424
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,677
- Oh, Andy.
- I know what you're gonna say.

425
00:23:18,847 --> 00:23:20,041
- I wanna quit.
- Quit?

426
00:23:20,215 --> 00:23:22,683
Would you lay down your tools
before the job was done?

427
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:25,411
- Would you be branded before men?
- All right, all right.

428
00:23:25,587 --> 00:23:27,054
You'll sell a million yet.

429
00:23:27,222 --> 00:23:29,918
Come on. And remember,
"The good life keeps rolling along. "

430
00:23:30,092 --> 00:23:32,060
Yeah, and we roll with it.

431
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,163
- We're going out, Miss Perry.
Yes, sir.

432
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,302
And remember,
"Life insurance is immortal. "

433
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,801
Yes, sir.
- That's the spirit.

434
00:23:42,971 --> 00:23:44,336
Come on, Rossie.

435
00:23:45,407 --> 00:23:47,432
Would you call Andy if I kissed you?

436
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:49,440
Not unless you wanna kiss him too.

437
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,707
That's for me.

438
00:23:53,882 --> 00:23:55,747
That's for you.

439
00:24:04,626 --> 00:24:05,923
- Norma.
- Norma.

440
00:24:06,094 --> 00:24:07,152
Norma.

441
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:08,819
How are you, darling?

442
00:24:08,997 --> 00:24:10,089
Gen, you look wonderful.

443
00:24:10,265 --> 00:24:12,665
Isn't it marvelous?
- We were just coming after you.

444
00:24:12,834 --> 00:24:15,962
- Throw down that pencil and climb back.
- Why? What's happened?

445
00:24:16,138 --> 00:24:20,040
Well, Mr. Wethered, the new boyfriend,
is a partner of J.J. Hobart, the producer...

446
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,073
...and J.J. Is putting on a show.

447
00:24:22,244 --> 00:24:24,144
And we're all going to be in it.

448
00:24:24,312 --> 00:24:26,303
Come, we'll meet the boys
at Embassy Club.

449
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:29,075
- And have lunch.
- And maybe shopping afterwards.

450
00:24:29,251 --> 00:24:31,082
No, thanks. I wouldn't care about that.

451
00:24:31,253 --> 00:24:34,017
You don't mean to say you like
this life insurance business?

452
00:24:34,189 --> 00:24:36,453
There's a boy in the office,
one of the salesmen.

453
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:37,717
Oh, I get it.

454
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,260
I know when I'm well off,
those paychecks come in like clockwork.

455
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:43,761
The poor child. Must be the heat.

456
00:24:43,932 --> 00:24:45,092
Or love.

457
00:24:45,267 --> 00:24:46,996
Something.
Is there nothing we can do?

458
00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:50,434
Nope. Oh, yes, find somebody
who wants insurance.

459
00:24:50,605 --> 00:24:52,766
If anybody wants it, we'll find them.

460
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:54,203
Maybe we can sell the boys.

461
00:24:54,376 --> 00:24:55,468
- Yeah.
- That's grand.

462
00:24:55,644 --> 00:24:57,407
We've gotta go.
They're waiting for us.

463
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,376
Bye.
Bye-bye.

464
00:25:01,616 --> 00:25:02,674
To the Embassy, Pierre.

465
00:25:12,794 --> 00:25:14,056
Hello, Wethy, baby.

466
00:25:14,229 --> 00:25:16,060
Hello, Hugo, you little darling.

467
00:25:16,231 --> 00:25:17,789
Not in public, Irene.

468
00:25:17,966 --> 00:25:21,265
- Mr. Hugo, Miss Larkin, Miss...
LaVerne.

469
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,563
- How do you do?
- Where is my sugar daddy?

470
00:25:23,738 --> 00:25:25,706
Didn't you bring one for me
sure enough?

471
00:25:25,874 --> 00:25:27,705
I thought we will meet Mr. J.J. Hobart.

472
00:25:27,876 --> 00:25:29,707
He wouldn't come, he felt too sick.

473
00:25:29,878 --> 00:25:32,073
What's Sally supposed to do?
Twiddle her thumbs?

474
00:25:32,247 --> 00:25:33,509
Sally can twiddle anything.

475
00:25:33,682 --> 00:25:36,378
I'm sorry, something's happened.
Got to speak to you alone.

476
00:25:36,551 --> 00:25:39,247
Will you excuse us, please?

477
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:45,051
- One champagne cocktail and a martini.
Yes.

478
00:25:45,227 --> 00:25:46,387
Baby, what's the matter?

479
00:25:46,561 --> 00:25:49,155
Oh, judgment day has sounded.

480
00:25:49,331 --> 00:25:51,697
J.J. Insists on putting on the show.

481
00:25:51,866 --> 00:25:54,801
What's wrong with that?
He's been putting on shows for 20 years.

482
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,904
Sit down
so that you can stand the shock.

483
00:25:57,505 --> 00:25:58,802
Well, what's the matter?

484
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,337
We haven't got the money
to do the show.

485
00:26:02,911 --> 00:26:06,142
- You mean, J.J.'s broke?
- Yeah, almost, and he doesn't know it.

486
00:26:06,948 --> 00:26:09,075
We got a tip on the market, we lost.

487
00:26:09,251 --> 00:26:11,481
We tried to get it back, we lost more.

488
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:14,053
Oh, it's all becoming very clear.

489
00:26:14,222 --> 00:26:17,680
And when the time comes for J.J.
To sign the check, he's going to find out.

490
00:26:17,859 --> 00:26:21,795
And then we're gonna be out on our ears
and very possibly behind the bars.

491
00:26:21,963 --> 00:26:24,022
Why don't you talk him out
of doing the show?

492
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:25,723
As though we haven't tried.

493
00:26:26,434 --> 00:26:28,334
If only something would happen to him.

494
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,403
He's been on the edge for months.

495
00:26:30,572 --> 00:26:33,666
If only he'd fall apart while there's time.

496
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,640
What good would that do?
Wouldn't they investigate the books?

497
00:26:36,811 --> 00:26:40,110
Gen, you've got to think of something,
my mind is blank.

498
00:26:40,282 --> 00:26:42,375
J.J. Is likely to find that out too.

499
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:45,417
Well, has Genevieve got any ideas?

500
00:26:45,587 --> 00:26:46,747
Shh.

501
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:49,355
- She's thinking.
- Really?

502
00:26:50,392 --> 00:26:51,416
Boys, I've got it.

503
00:26:51,593 --> 00:26:52,617
- What?
- Got what?

504
00:26:52,794 --> 00:26:54,694
Insure him.
Make yourselves beneficiaries.

505
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:58,799
If he can't last longer, insure the brains and
spirit of Hobart, Wethered and Hugo.

506
00:26:58,967 --> 00:26:59,991
How can we do it?

507
00:27:00,168 --> 00:27:04,104
Get one of those high pressure men with
facts and statistics, let him do the selling.

508
00:27:04,272 --> 00:27:05,933
That's what we need, high pressure.

509
00:27:06,107 --> 00:27:09,270
- Wait, wait, I've got it.
- Got what?

510
00:27:09,444 --> 00:27:11,344
My brother's wife's brother...

511
00:27:11,513 --> 00:27:14,539
No, no, now, let's keep
your family out of this.

512
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:18,948
Your sister's husband's cousin
gave us that tip on the market.

513
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,452
What we need is a stranger.

514
00:27:21,623 --> 00:27:23,454
Well, I have just the one for you.

515
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:24,683
The Good Life Agency.

516
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:26,952
- I never heard of them.
- So much the better.

517
00:27:27,128 --> 00:27:29,028
Hand me that telephone.

518
00:27:32,434 --> 00:27:34,698
- Hello.
- Hello, Good Life Agency?

519
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:36,166
This is Genevieve Larkin.

520
00:27:36,338 --> 00:27:37,396
Hello, Gen.

521
00:27:39,174 --> 00:27:41,540
Hello, this is Morty Wethered speaking.

522
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,871
Yes, of Hobart, Wethered and Hugo.

523
00:27:44,045 --> 00:27:46,343
I wanna talk to your best salesman,
please.

524
00:27:46,514 --> 00:27:48,982
Oh, yeah. Yeah, wait a minute.

525
00:28:01,796 --> 00:28:03,127
Answer the phone, quickly.

526
00:28:04,733 --> 00:28:05,825
Hello.

527
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,198
Look, we want one of your best men
sent over here to handle a little policy.

528
00:28:10,372 --> 00:28:12,932
Oh, well,
there's no one in the office right now.

529
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,541
Talk to him.

530
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:16,643
Hey, hey, will I do? I mean...

531
00:28:16,811 --> 00:28:19,939
Well, you said your best man.
What's the name?

532
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,310
Oh, our best man is named Andy.

533
00:28:24,219 --> 00:28:25,550
Rosmer Peek.

534
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,349
Oh, yes, yes, he's our best man.
There's no doubt about that.

535
00:28:29,524 --> 00:28:31,958
Hobart Theatre, 2:00?

536
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,857
Yes, sir, positively.

537
00:28:35,397 --> 00:28:36,489
Wow!

538
00:28:36,731 --> 00:28:38,596
Norma,
somebody actually wants insurance.

539
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:42,032
- Oh, wonderful.
- Life insurance is immortal.

540
00:28:53,615 --> 00:28:55,879
Good afternoon, Mr. Hobart.
Good afternoon, J.J.

541
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:59,178
Good afternoon, Mr. Hobart.
Good afternoon, Mr. Hobart.

542
00:28:59,754 --> 00:29:01,278
Good afternoon, Mr. Hobart.

543
00:29:01,456 --> 00:29:04,050
Yeah, what's good about it?

544
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,285
- Good afternoon, chief.
- Good afternoon, J.J.

545
00:29:39,461 --> 00:29:42,555
Stop slamming doors, soften your tone.

546
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:46,359
Please, have a little respect
for a tired old man.

547
00:29:47,402 --> 00:29:48,426
That's a good one.

548
00:29:48,603 --> 00:29:50,161
"Tired old man. "

549
00:29:50,338 --> 00:29:52,533
You're only as old as you feel.

550
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:58,304
Now, listen,
I am old and I am tired, see?

551
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,141
Yeah, that's settled. Now what?

552
00:30:00,582 --> 00:30:04,814
Well, J.J.,
Hugo and I have been thinking...

553
00:30:04,986 --> 00:30:06,977
That's something new, at least.

554
00:30:07,655 --> 00:30:09,885
Oh, J.J.

555
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,889
Oh, what's the use?

556
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:17,965
Here I've spent my life building up what?

557
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:21,097
Fifty-nine years old today.

558
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:22,293
I'm sick of it.

559
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,903
Sick of the city.

560
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,266
Sick of the country.

561
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,601
I'm sick of the theater.

562
00:30:27,775 --> 00:30:29,470
Sick of you.

563
00:30:29,644 --> 00:30:31,271
Sick of myself.

564
00:30:31,446 --> 00:30:34,438
Now, J.J., how can you talk like that?

565
00:30:34,616 --> 00:30:37,346
Oh, come, come, gentlemen, what is it?

566
00:30:37,785 --> 00:30:41,016
It's like this, Hugo and I had an idea.

567
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,522
- Could I see Mr. Wethered?
- He's busy.

568
00:30:50,698 --> 00:30:52,029
Then I'll wait over here.

569
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,690
Over here.

570
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:07,046
Why? Why the Sam Hill
should I take out an insurance policy?

571
00:31:07,215 --> 00:31:08,807
But it's high time you realized...

572
00:31:08,983 --> 00:31:11,577
...that you're the keystone
of this organization.

573
00:31:11,753 --> 00:31:15,086
The guiding genius
of the American theater of today.

574
00:31:15,256 --> 00:31:17,918
And if you're taken away from us...

575
00:31:18,092 --> 00:31:19,354
Heaven forbid.

576
00:31:19,527 --> 00:31:21,051
We're sunk.
We're licked.

577
00:31:21,229 --> 00:31:24,062
Have you been keeping something
from me?

578
00:31:24,232 --> 00:31:27,429
Aren't we in A-1 financial condition?

579
00:31:27,602 --> 00:31:29,160
Why, of course.

580
00:31:29,337 --> 00:31:34,070
This makes me feel
as if you're all standing around, waiting.

581
00:31:34,242 --> 00:31:37,006
I'm surprised at you, chief.

582
00:31:37,178 --> 00:31:38,873
It's ridiculous.

583
00:31:39,047 --> 00:31:42,483
Well, we'll forget the whole thing.

584
00:31:43,418 --> 00:31:47,980
Ask Miss Bailey to call up
and see where that agency fellow is.

585
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,989
- Now, I don't want any insurance.
- Now, J.J.

586
00:31:52,794 --> 00:31:53,818
Nothing doing.

587
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:58,329
Oh, Miss Bailey, call up the Good Life
and find out where that salesman is.

588
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,327
He's here. Send him in.

589
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,492
Throw him out.

590
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:05,563
Come in.
Get out.

591
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:09,437
- Yes, sir.
Just a minute, just a minute.

592
00:32:10,812 --> 00:32:14,748
Mr. Peek, this is our president, Mr...

593
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,617
Mr. Hah.

594
00:32:17,785 --> 00:32:19,514
- Hobart.
- Oh, Mr. Hobart.

595
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,484
- And there's Mr. Hugo.
- How do you do?

596
00:32:21,656 --> 00:32:23,419
- How do you do, sir?
- I'm Mr. Wethered.

597
00:32:23,591 --> 00:32:24,615
How do you do, sir?

598
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:26,783
And won't you sit down?
Yes, thank you.

599
00:32:26,961 --> 00:32:28,121
Well?

600
00:32:28,663 --> 00:32:32,292
Well, how is the insurance business
these days, Mr. Peek?

601
00:32:32,467 --> 00:32:34,799
Well, the carloadings last month were...

602
00:32:35,436 --> 00:32:36,562
Carloadings?

603
00:32:37,005 --> 00:32:38,836
Yes, sir, yes, sir.

604
00:32:39,007 --> 00:32:41,305
The carloadings are up
16 and a half percent.

605
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:45,145
Listen, young man,
I wanna ask you a question.

606
00:32:45,313 --> 00:32:47,804
I've got enough money to live on.

607
00:32:47,982 --> 00:32:51,748
My theaters,
they're in A-1 financial shape.

608
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,547
I have no dependents of any kind.

609
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:59,318
Can you give me one reason
why I should have my life insured?

610
00:32:59,661 --> 00:33:01,356
Frankly, I can't.

611
00:33:01,529 --> 00:33:03,861
- Oh, life insurance is immoral.
What?

612
00:33:04,032 --> 00:33:06,432
Oh, I mean, life insurance is immortal.

613
00:33:07,769 --> 00:33:09,430
Oh, throw him out.

614
00:33:09,604 --> 00:33:11,629
Put him in the show as a comic.

615
00:33:11,806 --> 00:33:13,034
Oh, wait a minute, J.J.

616
00:33:13,207 --> 00:33:16,574
Mr. Peek, can you give Mr. Hobart
some figures and statistics?

617
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:22,538
I'm a sick man, I'm going to the doctor's.

618
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,848
Now, wait a minute, J.J.

619
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,647
Mr. Peek, will you...?

620
00:33:27,822 --> 00:33:31,383
Can you give us something definite
about insurance?

621
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,026
- Well, I...
- Now, just a moment.

622
00:33:33,194 --> 00:33:34,821
Mr. Peek has something else to say.

623
00:33:34,996 --> 00:33:38,625
Yeah, life insurance is immortal.
That's all he has to say.

624
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,824
Oh, no, no.

625
00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:41,866
Life insurance is triumphant.

626
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:45,366
I'm having one of my dizzy spells.

627
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,940
Give me a glass of water.

628
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,673
But, J.J., think of your responsibilities.

629
00:33:50,845 --> 00:33:53,177
I have no responsibilities.

630
00:33:53,347 --> 00:33:54,939
I don't give a darn about anybody.

631
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,879
You, you and you included.

632
00:33:57,051 --> 00:33:58,518
Not even your own family?

633
00:33:58,686 --> 00:34:01,154
I have no family.

634
00:34:01,322 --> 00:34:02,346
He's right.

635
00:34:02,523 --> 00:34:04,616
Mr. Peek has hit the nail
right on the head.

636
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,316
You have a family, J.J.

637
00:34:06,494 --> 00:34:08,052
A family of millions.

638
00:34:08,229 --> 00:34:10,220
- Millions?
- Millions?

639
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:13,663
Millions who have followed the fortunes
of J.J. Hobart and the theater.

640
00:34:13,835 --> 00:34:16,360
The audiences of America,
they are your responsibility.

641
00:34:16,537 --> 00:34:19,062
And after you've gone,
after we've all gone...

642
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,801
...audiences will still cling
to the tradition of J.J. Hobart.

643
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:27,175
And that is your
responsibility, J.J., tradition.

644
00:34:27,749 --> 00:34:31,241
Well, maybe.

645
00:34:32,053 --> 00:34:35,216
When the captain goes over the side
for the last time...

646
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:41,294
...life insurance takes the wheel.
And brings the ship safely into port.

647
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,259
Well...

648
00:34:44,432 --> 00:34:48,698
I'll take a policy in the name
of the company, and, well...

649
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,665
What do I do?
What have you got, young man?

650
00:34:52,106 --> 00:34:57,373
Well, have you heard about
our special $ 100 a month income plan?

651
00:34:57,545 --> 00:34:59,103
All right, I'll take it.

652
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,909
Mr. Peek, we had been thinking
of a straight life policy.

653
00:35:03,084 --> 00:35:04,881
Straight life for $ 1 million.

654
00:35:05,052 --> 00:35:06,212
What's this?

655
00:35:06,387 --> 00:35:07,752
Did you say $ 1 million?

656
00:35:07,922 --> 00:35:09,981
That's what I said.

657
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:13,584
That's what I thought you said.

658
00:35:13,761 --> 00:35:16,423
Have you any application blanks?

659
00:35:17,064 --> 00:35:18,463
Oh, yes, sir. Yes, sir.

660
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,530
- Well, I did have some here someplace.
- What?

661
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:24,170
- Oh, my briefcase, I had it...
- Here, here, here it is.

662
00:35:24,338 --> 00:35:27,171
Oh, here, I never leave without it.

663
00:35:29,076 --> 00:35:30,839
Wait a minute, this looks like it.

664
00:35:31,012 --> 00:35:33,742
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now, you're not fooling me, are you?

665
00:35:33,915 --> 00:35:35,883
Why, certainly not, young man.

666
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,779
All right, all right, shall we begin?

667
00:35:37,952 --> 00:35:39,715
Oh, come on, come on.

668
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:43,448
- Got to have your name and address here.
- You know both.

669
00:35:43,624 --> 00:35:46,718
Hey, you said $ 1 million, didn't you?

670
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,293
Give me this.

671
00:35:56,204 --> 00:35:58,934
There you are, J.J., sign there.

672
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,840
There you are, young man.

673
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,673
Mr. Peek, your pen.

674
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,374
Thank you.

675
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,776
A million dollars.

676
00:36:12,954 --> 00:36:14,216
Wow!

677
00:36:22,296 --> 00:36:27,029
Wow! A million bucks, a million bucks.

678
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:32,929
Men, on my
way up here, I said to myself:

679
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:35,268
"I'll bet this has been a tough day. "

680
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,876
It's like that sometimes.

681
00:36:37,044 --> 00:36:39,444
But don't worry, tomorrow's another day.

682
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,808
Anybody land anything?

683
00:36:40,982 --> 00:36:42,950
Here you are, Mr. Callahan.

684
00:36:43,851 --> 00:36:46,786
Well, fast nickels are better
than slow dollars.

685
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,512
Volume, that's what counts.

686
00:36:48,689 --> 00:36:49,883
Hey, Andy.

687
00:36:50,491 --> 00:36:51,958
Now, Peek, don't say it.

688
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,957
Remember the world hates a quitter.

689
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,288
Yeah, but, Andy, I...

690
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:59,991
The mongrel's hold may slip,
but only crowbars loose the bulldog's grip.

691
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:01,259
Now, listen, my boy.

692
00:37:01,435 --> 00:37:03,903
I too have known discouragement, but...

693
00:37:05,373 --> 00:37:08,706
- What's that?
- That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

694
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:10,234
Oh.

695
00:37:11,012 --> 00:37:13,310
Oh. Wow!

696
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,472
What is it, boss?
What is it, boss?

697
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,947
Come here, everybody.

698
00:37:17,118 --> 00:37:19,643
Wow, jumping sea lions.

699
00:37:20,087 --> 00:37:21,714
- You know what he's done?
No, what?

700
00:37:21,889 --> 00:37:24,824
He's brought in an application
for $ 1 million.

701
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:29,429
Let's see it.
Let's see it.

702
00:37:29,597 --> 00:37:31,292
Let me see it.
Hey!

703
00:37:32,566 --> 00:37:34,534
Somebody go to my desk
and get that bottle.

704
00:37:34,702 --> 00:37:36,602
- Drinks for everybody.
- What's the matter?

705
00:37:36,771 --> 00:37:40,798
Peek's just knocked over the biggest case
in history, $ 1 million, look.

706
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,700
Oh, Ross, I'm so proud of you.

707
00:37:43,878 --> 00:37:44,902
Here you are, Andy.

708
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:48,071
Peek, here, have yourself a drink.

709
00:37:49,317 --> 00:37:50,511
To Rosmer Peek.

710
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,916
The best gosh darned salesman
that ever stepped into this agency.

711
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,454
Rossi, you're in clover
for the rest of your life.

712
00:37:58,626 --> 00:38:00,890
Come on, tell us about it.
Now, boys, stand back.

713
00:38:01,062 --> 00:38:02,086
Come on, Rossi.

714
00:38:02,263 --> 00:38:05,664
- Well, I was just sitting here...
- Here, have another drink.

715
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:07,027
Yeah, yeah.

716
00:38:11,605 --> 00:38:14,665
- Well, to tell the truth...
- Come on, come on, give us the lowdown.

717
00:38:14,842 --> 00:38:16,469
Shut up and let him tell it. Go on.

718
00:38:16,644 --> 00:38:18,703
Oh, well,
I've been working here five months.

719
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,141
You hear that? Five months.

720
00:38:20,314 --> 00:38:22,373
That's perseverance,
five months on one case.

721
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,711
Here, have another drink.

722
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:30,884
Well, I went in there...

723
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,082
Cold?
- Cold turkey.

724
00:38:32,259 --> 00:38:34,693
- I didn't know a soul.
- You just felt your way along?

725
00:38:34,862 --> 00:38:37,057
- That's right, but I kept going.
- You hear that?

726
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,222
Get up and tell
the boys how you did it.

727
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,594
All right, all right.

728
00:38:41,635 --> 00:38:45,196
Well, I went in there,
and I got Wetherford.

729
00:38:45,373 --> 00:38:46,533
He's the vice president.

730
00:38:46,707 --> 00:38:48,698
You see?
Right at the top, that's the stuff.

731
00:38:48,876 --> 00:38:50,537
Have another drink.

732
00:38:55,649 --> 00:38:56,877
And then...

733
00:38:57,051 --> 00:38:58,882
Then he said he'd speak to Hobart and...

734
00:38:59,053 --> 00:39:02,318
But I says, "No, no, I'll do the talking. "

735
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:05,982
And then I went into Hobart's office.
He had a great big desk, 14 feet wide.

736
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,594
I sat down,
made myself very, very comfortable.

737
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,231
Looked him in the eye
and shook my finger on his face.

738
00:39:11,399 --> 00:39:12,889
And I says, "Hobart... "

739
00:39:13,067 --> 00:39:14,091
No, I didn't either.

740
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,394
I says, "J. J... "

741
00:39:15,569 --> 00:39:17,434
- Those were his initials.
- You hear that?

742
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,334
Personality, make him your pal.

743
00:39:19,507 --> 00:39:22,738
I says, "J.J., if you don't know
what you're doing, it's not my fault.

744
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:25,140
Here's a policy
worked out to the last detail.

745
00:39:25,312 --> 00:39:28,839
Now you can sign it, do yourself a favor,
or stew in your own juice. "

746
00:39:29,016 --> 00:39:30,415
- And he signed it?
- No, no.

747
00:39:30,584 --> 00:39:31,608
No?

748
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:36,120
I says, "J. J, you don't realize the millions of
people depending on you for entertainment.

749
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:40,852
The audiences of America, J.J.,
that is your family.

750
00:39:41,028 --> 00:39:43,462
A family of 50 million people.

751
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,292
That is your responsibility!

752
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,093
It's a tradition. "

753
00:39:47,268 --> 00:39:48,895
- Well, that got him.
- And he signed?

754
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,264
- Like a baby.
- Like a baby.

755
00:39:50,438 --> 00:39:53,100
He may be old and baldheaded,
but he signed like a baby.

756
00:39:53,274 --> 00:39:56,471
Say, Rosmer,
did you say old and baldheaded?

757
00:39:57,011 --> 00:39:59,104
Oh, Rosmer, how old is he?

758
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,338
Fifty-nine.

759
00:40:00,514 --> 00:40:01,538
Fifty-nine?

760
00:40:01,715 --> 00:40:03,307
Why, he won't pass the medical.

761
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,610
Huh?

762
00:40:04,852 --> 00:40:07,878
Wait a minute,
I know a guy who passed and he was 68.

763
00:40:08,055 --> 00:40:09,386
Yeah, passed out.

764
00:40:10,891 --> 00:40:12,722
He may not pass the medical.

765
00:40:14,295 --> 00:40:15,319
Get a doctor.

766
00:40:20,968 --> 00:40:23,402
- How does your head feel now?
- Oh, terrible.

767
00:40:23,571 --> 00:40:26,734
Just like somebody was poking at it
with a nut pick.

768
00:40:27,308 --> 00:40:28,866
Thanks for taking me to dinner.

769
00:40:29,043 --> 00:40:31,204
Did I take you to dinner?

770
00:40:32,546 --> 00:40:35,106
Oh, Ross,
will you stop worrying about J. J?

771
00:40:35,282 --> 00:40:37,614
You've given up hope
before they've examined him.

772
00:40:37,785 --> 00:40:38,809
So what?

773
00:40:38,986 --> 00:40:41,511
You're quitting that's what,
and I hate a quitter.

774
00:40:42,289 --> 00:40:43,347
Hey, wait a minute.

775
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:46,391
You ought to read a book or something
about perseverance.

776
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,391
- How men succeed.
- Well, I have.

777
00:40:48,562 --> 00:40:50,427
- I've been reading books all week.
- Yeah?

778
00:40:50,598 --> 00:40:52,691
- Just finished one Saturday.
- What's the name?

779
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,836
<i>Well, it was a swell one,
and it was called Mutual Attraction.</i>

780
00:40:56,003 --> 00:40:57,300
<i>- Mutual Attraction?
- Uh-huh.</i>

781
00:40:57,471 --> 00:41:00,770
It's all about love
and how to find one's mate.

782
00:41:00,941 --> 00:41:02,408
Eight easy lessons.

783
00:41:02,576 --> 00:41:03,600
Look, look.

784
00:41:03,777 --> 00:41:06,041
- When I hold your hands, how do you feel?
- Silly.

785
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:10,377
- When I put my arm around you?
- I can't tell with only one arm.

786
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:11,643
Now what's the reaction?

787
00:41:11,819 --> 00:41:12,843
Dithery.

788
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,885
- Now?
- Is this the seventh lesson?

789
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,488
What's the eighth?

790
00:41:16,657 --> 00:41:19,091
- What's the mater?
- The page was torn out.

791
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,727
- Quitter.
- No, I'm not.

792
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,056
- I mean about Mr. Hobart.
- Oh.

793
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:26,666
You know, if you'd convince yourself
that he'd pass the medical, he would.

794
00:41:26,834 --> 00:41:30,827
- Lf he doesn't, what are you gonna lose?
- A lot of money, and, baby, I need it.

795
00:41:31,005 --> 00:41:35,032
When a fellow's thinking about asking a girl
to marry him, he ought to have money.

796
00:41:35,209 --> 00:41:37,473
Are you thinking
about asking a girl to marry you?

797
00:41:37,645 --> 00:41:41,172
Well, I was,
if I could get a little bank account.

798
00:41:41,482 --> 00:41:43,643
Where there's love, is money necessary?

799
00:41:43,817 --> 00:41:45,409
I don't think so even if you do.

800
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:50,489
Well, I hate to be mercenary,
but I've gotta disagree with you.

801
00:41:50,658 --> 00:41:56,528
<i>Oh, baby, what I couldn't do</i>

802
00:41:56,730 --> 00:42:00,826
<i>With plenty of money and you</i>

803
00:42:01,235 --> 00:42:05,262
<i>In spite of the worry that money brings</i>

804
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:09,637
<i>Just a little filthy lucre
Buys a lot of things</i>

805
00:42:10,244 --> 00:42:14,305
<i>And I could take you to places
You'd like to go</i>

806
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:18,715
<i>But outside of that I've no use for dough</i>

807
00:42:18,886 --> 00:42:23,448
<i>It's the root of all evil
Of strife and upheaval</i>

808
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,489
<i>But I'm certain, honey</i>

809
00:42:25,659 --> 00:42:27,957
<i>That life could be sunny</i>

810
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:31,188
<i>With plenty of money and you</i>

811
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:02,952
<i>It's the root of all evil
Of strife and upheaval</i>

812
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:05,064
<i>But I'm certain, honey</i>

813
00:43:05,232 --> 00:43:07,257
<i>That life could be sunny</i>

814
00:43:07,434 --> 00:43:11,097
<i>With plenty of money and you</i>

815
00:43:12,439 --> 00:43:18,935
<i>With plenty of money and you</i>

816
00:43:24,385 --> 00:43:25,784
Right this way, doctors.

817
00:43:25,953 --> 00:43:27,716
Right this way.

818
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,684
Excuse me, excuse me.

819
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,453
- Good morning, miss.
- Good morning.

820
00:43:35,629 --> 00:43:38,359
- Remember me? I was here yesterday.
- Yes, I remember you.

821
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:41,023
Well, these are the doctors
to examine Mr. Hobart.

822
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:44,864
He isn't in, he may not be down
this morning, he isn't feeling well.

823
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,199
Always the little kidder.

824
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,603
- Did you say...?
Don't pay attention to her.

825
00:43:48,776 --> 00:43:51,301
She couldn't live
if she didn't have her little joke.

826
00:43:51,478 --> 00:43:53,241
J.J.

827
00:43:53,414 --> 00:43:54,711
Oh, Mr. Hobart, Mr. Hobart.

828
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,407
Yes, sir, everything is all set.
The doctors are here.

829
00:43:57,584 --> 00:44:00,553
We're here for the medical checkup,
as you know.

830
00:44:00,754 --> 00:44:02,949
Come back in a month.

831
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,758
Always clowning.
You know how these show people are.

832
00:44:07,328 --> 00:44:10,661
Oh, Mr. Wethered, these are the doctors
here to examine Mr. Hobart.

833
00:44:10,831 --> 00:44:12,662
Oh, yes.

834
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:14,198
Come right in, gentlemen.

835
00:44:14,368 --> 00:44:16,165
All right, doctors.

836
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,437
The doctors, J.J.

837
00:44:19,606 --> 00:44:21,733
Send them away, I don't feel good.

838
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,002
Now, J.J., that isn't fair.

839
00:44:24,178 --> 00:44:26,112
Good morning, J.J.

840
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:31,274
Dr. MacDuffy, Dr. Henry,
Dr. Bell, Dr. Warshof.

841
00:44:32,886 --> 00:44:36,754
Looking at you, Mr. Hobart, I would say
this examination was a mere formality.

842
00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:41,020
Which however, has to be done.

843
00:44:41,195 --> 00:44:42,856
Well, let's begin.

844
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:44,122
Come, J.J.

845
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,464
Come on.

846
00:44:48,635 --> 00:44:52,002
- Sit right here, J.J.
- I don't feel good.

847
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:56,876
Now, Mr. Hobart, have you ever been
treated for any disease or disturbances of...

848
00:44:57,044 --> 00:44:58,136
Answer separately.

849
00:44:58,312 --> 00:45:00,576
The brain, nerves, nose,
tonsils, throat, lungs...

850
00:45:00,748 --> 00:45:03,478
...heart, blood vessels,
stomach, liver, hay or rose fever?

851
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:04,674
No.

852
00:45:04,852 --> 00:45:06,717
Skin, bones, glands, gout, rheumatism...

853
00:45:06,887 --> 00:45:09,981
...tuberculosis, diabetes,
epilepsy, vertigo, dizzy spells?

854
00:45:10,157 --> 00:45:11,215
No.

855
00:45:11,392 --> 00:45:13,917
Maimed or deformed?
Do you use intoxicants of any kind?

856
00:45:14,094 --> 00:45:16,460
- Do you ever travel in tropical countries?
- Yes.

857
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,257
No.
- No.

858
00:45:18,432 --> 00:45:20,229
Let's proceed.

859
00:45:20,401 --> 00:45:22,528
Just stand up, J.J.

860
00:45:25,506 --> 00:45:28,532
Good heavens,
you're not gonna operate, are you?

861
00:45:28,709 --> 00:45:31,007
I'm afraid not, come on. Down you go.

862
00:45:31,178 --> 00:45:32,975
Careful now, careful, J.J., careful.

863
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,479
Upsy-daisy, up you go.

864
00:45:37,684 --> 00:45:38,708
There.

865
00:45:38,886 --> 00:45:42,617
You'd think I was a prize bull
in the county fair.

866
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:43,916
Please.

867
00:45:44,091 --> 00:45:46,753
Now, J.J., don't worry,
it'll all be over in a few minutes.

868
00:45:46,927 --> 00:45:48,189
Shh.

869
00:45:48,929 --> 00:45:50,328
Shh.

870
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,292
- Gentlemen, you concur?
- Absolutely.

871
00:45:53,467 --> 00:45:54,798
Yeah, well, it's about time.

872
00:45:54,968 --> 00:45:58,768
- One moment, please.
- No, you can agree with them or get out.

873
00:45:58,939 --> 00:46:00,372
Please, Mr. Hobart.

874
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:03,533
- No.
- Now kindly do this 10 times, very rapidly.

875
00:46:05,245 --> 00:46:06,439
Hello.

876
00:46:06,613 --> 00:46:07,875
It's for you, Mr. Peek.

877
00:46:08,048 --> 00:46:09,948
Oh, excuse me.

878
00:46:10,617 --> 00:46:11,641
Hello.

879
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:12,945
Oh, hello, Norma.

880
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,417
We can't wait any longer.

881
00:46:14,588 --> 00:46:15,748
Is he passing?

882
00:46:15,923 --> 00:46:18,619
Well, so far, yes, but we're not through.

883
00:46:18,792 --> 00:46:21,386
I'll let you know.
Keep your fingers crossed, goodbye.

884
00:46:21,795 --> 00:46:23,387
- What did he say?
What did he say?

885
00:46:23,564 --> 00:46:24,656
Practically nothing.

886
00:46:31,104 --> 00:46:32,571
MacDUFFY: Say, "Ah. "
- Ah.

887
00:46:32,739 --> 00:46:34,263
Ah. Ah!

888
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:36,168
- Say 99.
- Ninety-nine.

889
00:46:36,343 --> 00:46:38,243
- Ninety-nine.
- Ninety-nine.

890
00:46:38,412 --> 00:46:40,573
Breathe, deeply.

891
00:46:40,747 --> 00:46:41,975
That will be all, gentlemen.

892
00:46:43,317 --> 00:46:44,477
Take it easy, J.J.

893
00:46:44,651 --> 00:46:47,415
All right, all right.

894
00:46:47,588 --> 00:46:49,351
There you are.

895
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:51,055
Give me one of my pills.

896
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:54,683
I'm having a dizzy spell.

897
00:46:55,496 --> 00:46:58,659
Now, buck up, J.J.,
everything's gonna be all right.

898
00:47:01,502 --> 00:47:02,628
Oh, doctor.

899
00:47:02,803 --> 00:47:04,498
Doctor, how was it? Did he pass?

900
00:47:04,671 --> 00:47:07,572
You'll get your report in the usual way.

901
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,774
Here you are, J.J.

902
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,407
What's the matter? What's the matter?

903
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:20,781
Ever since those doctors have been here,
I've had the most awful pain in this arm.

904
00:47:22,189 --> 00:47:23,622
What...?

905
00:47:24,892 --> 00:47:27,656
Hey, you forgot your inner tube.

906
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,246
He didn't pass.

907
00:48:04,589 --> 00:48:06,921
Oh, Andy.

908
00:48:07,091 --> 00:48:08,956
Oh, Andy.

909
00:48:09,394 --> 00:48:11,760
Hey, Andy, here's another one.

910
00:48:23,408 --> 00:48:24,636
An error.

911
00:48:28,513 --> 00:48:29,673
Pennsylvania $ 1 million.

912
00:48:29,847 --> 00:48:31,974
Oh, no, I mean, this is...

913
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:33,674
This is J.J. Hobart's office.

914
00:48:33,851 --> 00:48:35,182
No, I didn't mean that, yes...

915
00:48:35,353 --> 00:48:37,719
No, no, we sell insurance.

916
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:40,687
I don't blame him.

917
00:48:47,498 --> 00:48:48,829
Take it, Andy.

918
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,092
Hello?

919
00:48:50,268 --> 00:48:51,394
No.

920
00:48:51,569 --> 00:48:52,866
Yes.

921
00:48:53,037 --> 00:48:55,096
Yes, I see.

922
00:48:55,273 --> 00:48:58,299
Oh, doc, for the love of Pete,
don't give me technicalities.

923
00:48:58,476 --> 00:49:01,707
Tell me, did he pass?

924
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,675
Wow! He passed.

925
00:49:07,385 --> 00:49:10,650
Oh, Boop, stick around, will you?
I feel funny.

926
00:49:11,155 --> 00:49:14,147
Let an old-timer give you a word
of advice, not that you need it.

927
00:49:14,325 --> 00:49:15,417
But get this.

928
00:49:15,593 --> 00:49:17,686
J.J. Hobart is your meal ticket.

929
00:49:18,363 --> 00:49:20,228
The longer he lives, the more you earn.

930
00:49:20,398 --> 00:49:22,798
But if anything happens to him,
your income stops.

931
00:49:22,967 --> 00:49:24,525
Remember, stay close to him.

932
00:49:24,702 --> 00:49:26,897
- Stay close to him?
- Yeah, that's right.

933
00:49:27,071 --> 00:49:28,095
Let me see.

934
00:49:28,272 --> 00:49:32,641
<i>"Health, Exercise, Diet, Weight Control,
Life Begins at Fo... "</i>

935
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:34,539
- How old is he?
- Fifty-nine.

936
00:49:34,712 --> 00:49:36,407
<i>"Life Begins at 40, Life... "</i>

937
00:49:36,581 --> 00:49:39,106
<i>Here it is, Life Begins at 59.</i>

938
00:49:39,283 --> 00:49:41,581
Now, remember, stay close to him.

939
00:49:42,487 --> 00:49:43,852
- Boop, you want a job?
- Sure.

940
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:45,990
You're night shift,
10 percent goes to you.

941
00:49:46,157 --> 00:49:48,717
Stay close to that fellow, will you?
Stay in his pocket.

942
00:49:48,893 --> 00:49:50,383
I'll surround him.

943
00:49:53,765 --> 00:49:55,426
Hello, get me the Hobart Theatre.

944
00:49:57,335 --> 00:49:59,599
Hello? What?

945
00:49:59,771 --> 00:50:02,103
He passed. He passed the medical.

946
00:50:02,273 --> 00:50:04,173
He did?

947
00:50:04,342 --> 00:50:05,741
Hold the wire.

948
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:07,707
He passed.

949
00:50:09,714 --> 00:50:10,772
Say, listen, Peek...

950
00:50:10,948 --> 00:50:14,782
...could you get that policy
over to my place on Long Island tonight?

951
00:50:14,952 --> 00:50:16,044
You could?

952
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:19,678
Fine. And say, bring your girl.

953
00:50:19,857 --> 00:50:21,347
Yeah, bring anybody's girl.

954
00:50:21,526 --> 00:50:22,584
Bring all your friends.

955
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,160
We're gonna have a party to celebrate.

956
00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:27,229
Fine.

957
00:50:27,799 --> 00:50:30,632
Gen, you're a genius.

958
00:50:30,802 --> 00:50:32,463
Just don't you forget it.

959
00:50:32,637 --> 00:50:33,661
Hey, wait a minute.

960
00:50:33,838 --> 00:50:35,499
What?
- We mustn't tell J.J.

961
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:38,008
- Why not?
- It might make him feel better.

962
00:50:38,176 --> 00:50:39,939
He might recuperate, so to speak.

963
00:50:40,111 --> 00:50:42,671
Oh, that's right.

964
00:50:42,847 --> 00:50:44,678
But we'd better have him to the party.

965
00:50:44,849 --> 00:50:45,975
Oh, sure.

966
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:48,516
Swimming. Night air.

967
00:50:48,686 --> 00:50:51,780
He might have a chill.

968
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:09,805
Now, what the dickens did you go
to all this trouble for?

969
00:51:09,974 --> 00:51:11,100
Well, J.J. Passed.

970
00:51:11,275 --> 00:51:12,902
I thought we ought to celebrate.

971
00:51:13,077 --> 00:51:14,169
And, remember, my boy...

972
00:51:14,345 --> 00:51:17,576
...it's not every night that we stand
on the threshold of $ 1 million.

973
00:51:17,748 --> 00:51:21,184
Besides, you never can tell
what might happen in the crowd.

974
00:51:21,352 --> 00:51:22,512
What are you going to do?

975
00:51:22,687 --> 00:51:26,316
Hit J.J. Over the head with a club
because he's insured for a million dollars?

976
00:51:26,491 --> 00:51:27,515
Why, Irene...

977
00:51:27,692 --> 00:51:30,593
...I'm surprised at you.
How can you think of such a thing?

978
00:51:30,761 --> 00:51:33,321
You might just be a little bit subtle.

979
00:51:33,998 --> 00:51:35,363
Well, here we are.

980
00:51:35,533 --> 00:51:39,128
Let's shake the dust of 42nd Street off
of our feet and mingle with the elite.

981
00:51:39,303 --> 00:51:42,067
It's too good to be true.
We're not dreaming, are we?

982
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,105
Certainly not.
Look at the moon up there.

983
00:51:44,275 --> 00:51:46,402
- Look at this garden, the crowd.
- Look at you.

984
00:51:46,577 --> 00:51:47,601
Yes.

985
00:51:47,778 --> 00:51:50,542
- Oh, if it would only last.
- I'll make it last, honey.

986
00:51:50,715 --> 00:51:53,149
From now on,
I've only got two people to worry about.

987
00:51:53,317 --> 00:51:56,809
As long as you're around, I'm delirious.
As long as J.J.'s around, I'm rich.

988
00:51:56,988 --> 00:52:00,617
- Hope he stays around a long time.
- With my care, he'll live to be a million.

989
00:52:01,659 --> 00:52:02,683
Hey, Boop.

990
00:52:05,796 --> 00:52:08,321
You're only here for one reason.
To keep an eye on J.J.

991
00:52:08,499 --> 00:52:11,434
Get your mind off of everything
and let me know when he arrives.

992
00:52:11,602 --> 00:52:14,662
Don't worry. Not even an earthquake
could move me from this duty.

993
00:52:14,839 --> 00:52:16,602
We're gonna dance.

994
00:52:30,421 --> 00:52:32,286
Hey, Sally. Remember me?

995
00:52:32,456 --> 00:52:33,946
Why, Mr. Ogleboop.

996
00:52:34,125 --> 00:52:36,593
Oglethorpe, but you may call me Boop.

997
00:52:40,498 --> 00:52:42,227
May I take your hat and coat, sir?

998
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,628
Well, I don't know.

999
00:52:43,801 --> 00:52:46,167
Darn foolishness
dragging me way out here.

1000
00:52:46,337 --> 00:52:48,703
I don't feel good.

1001
00:52:50,241 --> 00:52:51,765
When will you want your car, sir?

1002
00:52:51,943 --> 00:52:54,173
In about 15 minutes.

1003
00:52:54,345 --> 00:52:57,473
I don't wanna stay long.
I'm gonna get home and get to bed.

1004
00:52:57,648 --> 00:52:59,980
Yes, sir. I'll tell your chauffeur.

1005
00:53:03,621 --> 00:53:04,645
Darn fools.

1006
00:53:04,822 --> 00:53:08,019
They'll catch their death of cold
getting wet this time of night.

1007
00:53:08,192 --> 00:53:09,591
Remarkable, sir, isn't it?

1008
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,854
Hey, here's a piece here
that will fit in very well...

1009
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:15,260
...when we start hanging the crepe.

1010
00:53:18,803 --> 00:53:19,929
J.J.

1011
00:53:20,571 --> 00:53:21,731
Evening, J.J.

1012
00:53:21,906 --> 00:53:23,840
Well, for heaven's sake.

1013
00:53:25,943 --> 00:53:26,932
What do you mean?

1014
00:53:28,279 --> 00:53:29,541
Nothing, J.J. Nothing.

1015
00:53:29,714 --> 00:53:31,272
There's nothing wrong with us.

1016
00:53:31,449 --> 00:53:32,882
Shh.
- Huh? Oh.

1017
00:53:33,584 --> 00:53:35,950
Hey, what is this? What is it?

1018
00:53:36,354 --> 00:53:40,620
Look, J.J., if you don't feel all right,
if you don't wanna stay...

1019
00:53:40,791 --> 00:53:42,452
...I'll understand perfectly.

1020
00:53:42,627 --> 00:53:44,254
Understand what?

1021
00:53:44,428 --> 00:53:47,124
Are you sure you feel all right?

1022
00:53:47,298 --> 00:53:48,959
Say, listen here, I...

1023
00:53:49,133 --> 00:53:52,330
J.J., sit down, J.J.

1024
00:53:52,703 --> 00:53:54,671
We were worried about you.

1025
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:57,774
Of course, I don't say that if a man's face
is drawn and pale...

1026
00:53:57,942 --> 00:54:00,206
...it necessarily means anything.

1027
00:54:00,378 --> 00:54:03,472
No, it may be something
unimportant like pneumonia...

1028
00:54:03,648 --> 00:54:05,013
...or something like that.

1029
00:54:05,182 --> 00:54:08,242
Say, I thought I felt pretty good.

1030
00:54:08,653 --> 00:54:10,484
Good heavens.

1031
00:54:10,655 --> 00:54:11,679
What is it now?

1032
00:54:11,856 --> 00:54:16,384
Why, it's says here in this paper
that Stanley J. MacNeil dropped dead.

1033
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,822
Stan MacNeil?

1034
00:54:17,995 --> 00:54:20,088
Why, I saw him only last week.

1035
00:54:20,264 --> 00:54:22,027
Well, after all, he was getting on...

1036
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:24,224
- How old does it say he was?
- Fifty-eight.

1037
00:54:24,402 --> 00:54:27,235
- Well, ripe old age.
- Yeah.

1038
00:54:27,405 --> 00:54:28,997
What did he die of?

1039
00:54:29,173 --> 00:54:31,198
Overwork.

1040
00:54:31,375 --> 00:54:36,472
Just because old man MacNeil dies,
I suppose you think I'm next.

1041
00:54:39,884 --> 00:54:42,114
Can I get you a glass of water
or something?

1042
00:54:42,286 --> 00:54:43,719
- No.
- Don't you want a pill?

1043
00:54:43,888 --> 00:54:48,882
No. I think I better go inside
and lie down for a moment.

1044
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,425
Now, wait, wait, wait, J.J.

1045
00:54:50,594 --> 00:54:52,289
Look, look, you're all perspiring.

1046
00:54:52,463 --> 00:54:55,523
Here, you come right over here
and sit down where there's a breeze.

1047
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,361
That's it. Right in there.

1048
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:59,127
There you are.

1049
00:55:04,542 --> 00:55:08,638
Well, J.J., congratulations!
Congratulations!

1050
00:55:08,813 --> 00:55:10,337
- For what?
Didn't they tell you?

1051
00:55:10,514 --> 00:55:12,482
You passed the examination.
Perfect health.

1052
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:15,210
Heart of a man of 35.
The doctors were unanimous.

1053
00:55:15,386 --> 00:55:18,878
Said they could examine hundreds
before they'd find a man in your condition.

1054
00:55:19,056 --> 00:55:22,548
- They must've told you, didn't they?
- Well, we didn't want to lead him on.

1055
00:55:22,727 --> 00:55:25,821
We wanted to be sure
there wasn't any mistake.

1056
00:55:25,996 --> 00:55:29,591
- Say, I'm in good health, eh?
- Good health?

1057
00:55:29,767 --> 00:55:33,100
It isn't often that Good Life runs
across such an excellent risk as you.

1058
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:35,101
Doctors say you'll live to bury us all.

1059
00:55:35,272 --> 00:55:39,106
Mr. Peek, would you be good enough
to step over to the pool with me, please?

1060
00:55:39,276 --> 00:55:41,506
- Oh, yes, yes.
- No, leave him alone.

1061
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:44,978
I wanna talk to him.
Leave us alone, go away. Go away.

1062
00:55:45,149 --> 00:55:49,449
All right, but shall I send a wreath
to the MacNeil home?

1063
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:51,110
No.

1064
00:55:51,288 --> 00:55:54,189
Well, just a little one.

1065
00:55:54,358 --> 00:55:55,518
- Stanley J. MacNeil?
- Yes.

1066
00:55:55,693 --> 00:55:57,752
Why, we turned him down
less than a year ago.

1067
00:55:57,928 --> 00:55:59,987
You mean to say
that your company knew that...

1068
00:56:00,164 --> 00:56:03,429
Why, we could have predicted it
to the very day.

1069
00:56:03,601 --> 00:56:05,228
You think I'll pull through?

1070
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:08,133
Pull through?
Why, you're a perfect specimen.

1071
00:56:08,305 --> 00:56:10,773
Sit down, young man, sit down.
I wanna talk to you.

1072
00:56:10,941 --> 00:56:11,965
Now, tell me more.

1073
00:56:12,143 --> 00:56:14,577
All you gotta do
is follow the Good Life health plan.

1074
00:56:14,745 --> 00:56:17,179
Do or die. Sink or swim.
You'll live to be a hundred.

1075
00:56:17,348 --> 00:56:18,906
- It's in the cards.
- What cards?

1076
00:56:19,083 --> 00:56:21,074
Right here. Got it all figured out for you.

1077
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:24,380
Right here, right here,
it says keep out of drafts.

1078
00:56:26,657 --> 00:56:27,681
What's the matter?

1079
00:56:27,858 --> 00:56:29,348
- You're in a draft.
- Yeah?

1080
00:56:29,527 --> 00:56:32,325
That's the very important thing
of the Good Life health plan.

1081
00:56:32,496 --> 00:56:34,430
Stay out of drafts.

1082
00:56:34,598 --> 00:56:37,089
Is it all right here?

1083
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:40,499
- All right here, all right.
- I might've sat over there for hours.

1084
00:56:40,671 --> 00:56:43,299
Young man, I like you.

1085
00:56:43,474 --> 00:56:44,498
What's that one?

1086
00:56:44,675 --> 00:56:47,075
<i>"How to Feel Like a Million.
Play Games for Health. "</i>

1087
00:56:47,244 --> 00:56:50,736
- Play games? I never had time.
- Make time.

1088
00:56:50,915 --> 00:56:53,179
Say, did you ever play Indian wrestling?

1089
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:54,681
Is it anything like Japanese?

1090
00:56:54,852 --> 00:56:56,376
How should I know? I'll show you.

1091
00:56:56,554 --> 00:56:59,079
Stand right there.
Put your foot onto mine.

1092
00:56:59,256 --> 00:57:00,985
- Right foot?
- Yeah. Give me your hand.

1093
00:57:01,158 --> 00:57:03,183
Now. Now, pull.

1094
00:57:05,596 --> 00:57:07,223
Wow, you've got strength.

1095
00:57:07,398 --> 00:57:10,231
Yeah, I haven't done that for years.

1096
00:57:10,401 --> 00:57:11,493
What else you got there?

1097
00:57:11,669 --> 00:57:13,864
<i>- Life Begins At 59.
- I thought it was 40?</i>

1098
00:57:14,038 --> 00:57:17,064
- Oh, no, it's 59, in your case, J.J.
- Let me see that.

1099
00:57:18,108 --> 00:57:20,599
Why, doggone it, it says 59.

1100
00:57:20,778 --> 00:57:23,144
<i>"Life Begins At 59."</i>

1101
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:24,338
Well, why not?

1102
00:57:28,819 --> 00:57:32,084
You're still in a draft, J.J.
We better work up a little circulation.

1103
00:57:32,256 --> 00:57:34,486
What did you wanna invite Peek for,
anyway?

1104
00:57:34,658 --> 00:57:35,784
To get the policy.

1105
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,190
And why didn't you keep him away
from J. J?

1106
00:57:38,362 --> 00:57:40,455
Oh, well, why didn't you?

1107
00:57:41,232 --> 00:57:42,756
Hey.

1108
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:46,968
How deep is the pool at that end?

1109
00:57:47,304 --> 00:57:49,033
Eleven feet. Why?

1110
00:57:49,206 --> 00:57:50,230
I was just thinking.

1111
00:57:51,609 --> 00:57:54,134
Hello, baby, am I late?
Or hasn't anything started yet?

1112
00:57:54,311 --> 00:57:56,370
Gen, you're in the nick of time.

1113
00:57:56,547 --> 00:57:58,105
You sound like a melodrama. Why?

1114
00:57:58,282 --> 00:58:02,150
Peek broke the news to J.J. That he passed
and J.J.'s getting younger by the minute.

1115
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:03,786
You've got to take him in hand.

1116
00:58:03,954 --> 00:58:06,548
Get Peek away from him
or he'll have J.J. Back in shape.

1117
00:58:06,724 --> 00:58:08,555
Ask him to dance. Keep him on his feet.

1118
00:58:08,726 --> 00:58:09,954
Get him overheated.

1119
00:58:10,127 --> 00:58:11,924
Where is he?

1120
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:13,854
There.

1121
00:58:14,031 --> 00:58:15,191
Is that J.J. Hobart?

1122
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:16,958
That's the guy.

1123
00:58:17,401 --> 00:58:18,698
That old fellow.

1124
00:58:18,869 --> 00:58:20,962
Morty, he's got 2 feet
in the grave already.

1125
00:58:21,138 --> 00:58:23,766
Well, all we've got to do
is to make him lie down in it.

1126
00:58:23,941 --> 00:58:24,965
Don't you worry.

1127
00:58:25,142 --> 00:58:27,542
I'll have him pull the dirt in over him.

1128
00:58:28,045 --> 00:58:29,478
Good girl.

1129
00:58:29,914 --> 00:58:31,108
That's the boy.

1130
00:58:31,282 --> 00:58:34,251
With your physique,
you should have been a prizefighter.

1131
00:58:34,418 --> 00:58:36,579
Oh, Mr. Hobart.

1132
00:58:37,021 --> 00:58:39,012
I can't find anyone to dance with me.

1133
00:58:39,189 --> 00:58:43,148
That is, I mean anyone
that I would like to dance with.

1134
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:45,955
Would you like to dance with me?

1135
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:48,325
Oh, would you really?

1136
00:58:48,499 --> 00:58:50,330
Would I?

1137
00:58:50,868 --> 00:58:54,099
Darned if life don't begin at 59.

1138
00:59:05,316 --> 00:59:06,340
Knock, knock.

1139
00:59:06,517 --> 00:59:07,779
- Who's there?
- Remember me?

1140
00:59:07,952 --> 00:59:09,920
Oh, yes. You're the guy what brung me.

1141
00:59:10,087 --> 00:59:12,647
And a very successful guy too.
Everything's all set.

1142
00:59:12,823 --> 00:59:13,847
J.J. Is feeling fine.

1143
00:59:14,024 --> 00:59:17,585
I'll get my commission tomorrow and end up
by being one of the wealthy class.

1144
00:59:17,761 --> 00:59:20,457
It's probably time
I thought about getting married.

1145
00:59:20,631 --> 00:59:23,395
Somewhere before
I've heard that speech.

1146
00:59:23,567 --> 00:59:27,162
Oh, but I mean it. With my check,
we could start right out with a dining set.

1147
00:59:27,338 --> 00:59:29,431
With a bit of straining,
we could get a radio.

1148
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:32,405
And then, if J.J. Lives a while,
we could get a bedroom set...

1149
00:59:32,576 --> 00:59:34,100
We better dance.

1150
00:59:34,278 --> 00:59:35,575
- Norma?
- Yes.

1151
00:59:35,746 --> 00:59:38,214
I meant that crack about getting married.

1152
00:59:38,382 --> 00:59:40,577
I'm terribly in love with you.

1153
00:59:40,751 --> 00:59:43,743
- How do people act at a time like this?
- I don't know.

1154
00:59:43,921 --> 00:59:46,151
I'm not an old hand at it, myself.

1155
00:59:47,024 --> 00:59:50,187
We could get married but there are things
we should talk over first.

1156
00:59:50,361 --> 00:59:53,558
- Like for instance, what?
- Like for instance, are we really in love?

1157
00:59:53,731 --> 00:59:55,198
We'll find that out soon enough.

1158
00:59:55,366 --> 00:59:57,698
- Just let's...
- Let's what?

1159
00:59:58,702 --> 01:00:04,732
<i>Let's put our heads together</i>

1160
01:00:04,908 --> 01:00:10,744
<i>Is it love or is it weather?</i>

1161
01:00:10,914 --> 01:00:15,851
<i>How are we to know so soon</i>

1162
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:18,682
<i>With so much April</i>

1163
01:00:18,856 --> 01:00:22,587
<i>And with so much moon?</i>

1164
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:26,992
<i>Wise old moon</i>

1165
01:00:27,164 --> 01:00:31,726
<i>Laughing at romancers</i>

1166
01:00:31,902 --> 01:00:38,307
<i>He perhaps knows all the answers</i>

1167
01:00:38,642 --> 01:00:42,942
<i>Let's put our heads together</i>

1168
01:00:43,113 --> 01:00:46,605
<i>For with our heads together</i>

1169
01:00:46,784 --> 01:00:52,120
<i>We'll know the answers too</i>

1170
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:55,155
Let's, oh, let's...

1171
01:00:55,325 --> 01:00:56,349
Let's what?

1172
01:00:56,527 --> 01:00:58,825
- Put our heads together.
- Oh.

1173
01:00:58,996 --> 01:01:01,794
Look, Morty, do you suppose that's love?

1174
01:01:01,965 --> 01:01:03,865
Must be the weather.

1175
01:01:05,002 --> 01:01:10,099
<i>How are we to know so soon</i>

1176
01:01:10,274 --> 01:01:12,401
<i>With so much April</i>

1177
01:01:12,576 --> 01:01:15,943

<i>Let's put our heads together</i>

01:02:05,929 --> 01:02:08,727
<i>Wise old moon</i>

1190
01:02:08,899 --> 01:02:14,337
<i>He's laughing at romancers</i>

1191
01:02:14,505 --> 01:02:20,637
<i>He perhaps knows all the answers</i>

1192
01:02:20,811 --> 01:02:25,771
<i>Let's put our heads together</i>

1193
01:02:25,949 --> 01:02:30,318
<i>For with our heads together</i>

1194
01:02:30,487 --> 01:02:35,424
<i>They'll know the answers too</i>

1195
01:02:37,027 --> 01:02:39,587
<i>Speakin' of the weather</i>

1196
01:02:39,763 --> 01:02:42,061
<i>Speakin' of the weather</i>

1197
01:02:42,232 --> 01:02:45,565
<i>Speakin' of the weather
It isn't the humidity</i>

1198
01:02:45,736 --> 01:02:46,828
<i>It's you</i>

1199
01:02:47,004 --> 01:02:49,336
<i>Come donner, come blitzen</i>

1200
01:02:49,506 --> 01:02:51,770
<i>Come pitter or pat</i>

1201
01:02:51,942 --> 01:02:54,604
<i>What in thunder is thunder</i>

1202
01:02:54,778 --> 01:02:57,178
<i>Compared to my heart
When it beats like that</i>

1203
01:02:57,347 --> 01:02:59,645
<i>Speakin' of the weather</i>

1204
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:02,012
<i>Speakin' of the thunder</i>

1205
01:03:02,186 --> 01:03:04,552
<i>Speakin' of the lightning
It's frightening, dear</i>

1206
01:03:04,721 --> 01:03:06,985
<i>What your eyes can do</i>

1207
01:03:07,157 --> 01:03:09,682
<i>Let the heavens crash, zoom and swirl</i>

1208
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:10,952
<i>Let it flash</i>

1209
01:03:11,128 --> 01:03:13,028
<i>Boy meets girl</i>

1210
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:16,124
<i>Oh, good old weather
Ain't it lovely weather?</i>

1211
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:19,963
<i>And, incidentally, I love you</i>

1212
01:03:20,137 --> 01:03:22,469
<i>Let the heavens crash, zoom and swirl</i>

1213
01:03:22,639 --> 01:03:24,573
<i>Let it flash, boy meets girl</i>

1214
01:03:25,209 --> 01:03:27,541
<i>Speakin' of the weather
Good old weather</i>

1215
01:03:27,711 --> 01:03:30,111
<i>Ain't it lovely weather?
And incidentally</i>

1216
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,373
<i>- I love you
- I love you</i>

1217
01:06:07,070 --> 01:06:08,264
Look.

1218
01:06:24,021 --> 01:06:25,784
How do you feel?

1219
01:06:25,956 --> 01:06:28,424
Oh, I'm hot. I'm burning up.

1220
01:06:28,592 --> 01:06:30,457
You'd better come into the house, J.J.

1221
01:06:30,627 --> 01:06:34,028
Right this way. Here, right this way.

1222
01:06:34,197 --> 01:06:36,722
You just probably got yourself
a little bit overheated.

1223
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:38,060
All right. There you go.

1224
01:06:42,506 --> 01:06:43,530
- Help.
- Help.

1225
01:06:43,707 --> 01:06:44,731
Not so loud.

1226
01:06:44,908 --> 01:06:46,102
- Help.
- Help.

1227
01:06:46,276 --> 01:06:47,470
Help!

1228
01:06:47,978 --> 01:06:49,969
Help! Help!

1229
01:06:50,147 --> 01:06:52,377
- It's J.J.
Help me!

1230
01:06:52,549 --> 01:06:55,279
Help. Help.

1231
01:06:55,452 --> 01:06:58,910
- J.J., J.J., I'll save you.
Help.

1232
01:07:00,057 --> 01:07:02,685
Hold on, J.J., hold on.

1233
01:07:02,859 --> 01:07:05,623
I'll save you, J.J., I'll save you.
I'll save you, J.J.

1234
01:07:06,296 --> 01:07:07,854
Nice work, Rosmer, nice work.

1235
01:07:08,031 --> 01:07:10,022
- Take it easy.
- Hold my hand. Over this way.

1236
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,794
Boop, come in here
and earn your 10 percent.

1237
01:07:12,969 --> 01:07:15,529
- Come in, earn your 10 percent.
- To the rescue.

1238
01:07:15,705 --> 01:07:17,297
All right. Come on, J.J.

1239
01:07:17,474 --> 01:07:19,032
Give me your hand.

1240
01:07:27,117 --> 01:07:28,982
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1241
01:07:31,288 --> 01:07:33,882
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1242
01:07:34,057 --> 01:07:36,184
Take it easy, J.J. All right, take it easy.

1243
01:07:36,359 --> 01:07:38,589
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1244
01:07:39,429 --> 01:07:41,693
- Somebody pushed me.
Take it easy.

1245
01:07:45,402 --> 01:07:47,370
Are you all right, J. J? Are you all right?

1246
01:07:47,537 --> 01:07:48,731
Are you all right?

1247
01:07:48,905 --> 01:07:52,432
Oh, young man,
I wanna thank you for saving my life.

1248
01:07:52,609 --> 01:07:54,907
You're a hero. I won't forget it.

1249
01:07:55,078 --> 01:07:57,239
That's all right, J.J. That's all right.

1250
01:07:57,414 --> 01:08:00,042
- But are you all right, Mr. Hobart?
- Yes. No.

1251
01:08:00,217 --> 01:08:01,616
I don't know.

1252
01:08:01,785 --> 01:08:04,879
But I tell you, somebody pushed me.

1253
01:08:05,055 --> 01:08:06,784
Now, J.J., listen, that's impossible.

1254
01:08:06,957 --> 01:08:09,755
- Hugo and I were right behind you.
Why, yes.

1255
01:08:09,926 --> 01:08:12,156
That's right.
You could have seen anybody...

1256
01:08:12,329 --> 01:08:13,489
Certainly.

1257
01:08:13,663 --> 01:08:15,927
- Come right into the house, J.J.
- Right over here.

1258
01:08:16,099 --> 01:08:17,191
Careful, boys, careful.

1259
01:08:18,635 --> 01:08:21,103
Any other man in the world at his age...

1260
01:08:21,271 --> 01:08:24,138
...would've come out of that pool
a walking case of pneumonia.

1261
01:08:24,307 --> 01:08:26,298
But not J.J.

1262
01:08:26,476 --> 01:08:28,774
He took it like a medicinal bath.

1263
01:08:28,945 --> 01:08:31,607
He's been in there all day
with Peek and that other guy.

1264
01:08:31,781 --> 01:08:34,409
- What do you suppose they're doing?
- How should I know?

1265
01:08:42,692 --> 01:08:45,217
Come on, young man.
Give me some opposition.

1266
01:08:45,395 --> 01:08:47,090
What's that?

1267
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:49,364
It sounds like something in J.J.'s office.

1268
01:08:51,234 --> 01:08:53,794
Come on,
maybe something's happened to him.

1269
01:08:56,973 --> 01:08:57,997
Oh, hello, boys.

1270
01:08:58,175 --> 01:09:00,905
- I must say...
- Say, how does it stand now, Rossie?

1271
01:09:01,077 --> 01:09:02,908
Eighteen to six. How are you, fellas?

1272
01:09:03,079 --> 01:09:05,946
Look, J.J., there are several matters
that are very important.

1273
01:09:06,116 --> 01:09:08,880
You can talk to my new general manager
about them later.

1274
01:09:09,052 --> 01:09:11,077
- Your new...
- General manager?

1275
01:09:11,254 --> 01:09:13,620
- That's me.
- You mean Peek?

1276
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:16,691
Run along now, we're busy.
Go on, go on.

1277
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:18,794
A couple of sissies.

1278
01:09:18,962 --> 01:09:21,726
J.J., I wanna thank you
for what you have done for me.

1279
01:09:21,898 --> 01:09:24,560
Forget it, young man, I like you.

1280
01:09:24,734 --> 01:09:26,861
I'm through with this game.

1281
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:28,231
Need something strenuous.

1282
01:09:28,672 --> 01:09:30,264
I know. Let's wrestle.

1283
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:31,873
But, now, J.J. Now, wait.

1284
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:34,510
Wait. Careful, careful.

1285
01:09:34,678 --> 01:09:37,943
I'd like to bust that guy, Peek,
right in the nose.

1286
01:09:38,114 --> 01:09:41,675
You know, if he keeps this up,
he'll have J.J. In short pants.

1287
01:09:41,851 --> 01:09:44,820
What do you mean? He is in short pants.

1288
01:09:44,988 --> 01:09:49,516
Well, we'll have him in diapers next
if we don't do something about it.

1289
01:10:05,508 --> 01:10:07,476
Now what are they doing?

1290
01:10:08,144 --> 01:10:11,375
Now they are playing leapfrog.

1291
01:10:13,583 --> 01:10:16,711
Well, if my brother-in-law
had handled this...

1292
01:10:16,886 --> 01:10:18,979
Oh, drat your brother-in-law.

1293
01:10:19,155 --> 01:10:22,181
We've got to find a way
to make J.J. Old again.

1294
01:10:22,359 --> 01:10:26,489
As old as time so that his teeth fall out
and his hands shake.

1295
01:10:30,467 --> 01:10:32,025
Hello.

1296
01:10:32,202 --> 01:10:33,294
Yes.

1297
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:34,903
Send her in.

1298
01:10:36,006 --> 01:10:40,670
Listen, what makes a man crack up?

1299
01:10:40,844 --> 01:10:43,312
- Oh, trouble? Relations?
- No.

1300
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:48,349
Mr. Hugo, I give you Genevieve.

1301
01:11:00,297 --> 01:11:01,321
There he is.

1302
01:11:01,498 --> 01:11:03,466
- Now, you know what to do, don't you?
- Yes.

1303
01:11:03,633 --> 01:11:06,534
Well, if she doesn't,
she's changed a lot in the last few days.

1304
01:11:06,703 --> 01:11:10,195
Oh, it's so hard to be good
under the capitalistic system.

1305
01:11:21,451 --> 01:11:23,282
I beg your pardon.

1306
01:11:23,453 --> 01:11:24,886
Oh, not at all.

1307
01:11:25,055 --> 01:11:26,522
I remember you.

1308
01:11:26,690 --> 01:11:28,749
Why, you're Mr. Hobart, aren't you?

1309
01:11:28,925 --> 01:11:31,485
And you're the whirling dervish.

1310
01:11:31,661 --> 01:11:33,492
Yes. Oh, I'm so sorry.

1311
01:11:33,663 --> 01:11:36,894
I didn't know this was your place.
You will forgive me, won't you?

1312
01:11:37,067 --> 01:11:39,262
Well, I think I might.

1313
01:11:39,436 --> 01:11:42,337
Do you mind if I sit down? I'm so tired.

1314
01:11:42,505 --> 01:11:44,496
I've been walking so long.

1315
01:11:44,674 --> 01:11:45,698
Walking?

1316
01:11:45,875 --> 01:11:48,400
Oh, it's so hard being a debutante.

1317
01:11:48,578 --> 01:11:52,070
Oh, you're one of those?

1318
01:11:52,248 --> 01:11:55,115
Yes. And you know what debutantes do?

1319
01:11:55,285 --> 01:11:56,513
No. What?

1320
01:11:56,686 --> 01:12:00,645
Well, going around seeing people
about all sorts of worthy causes.

1321
01:12:00,824 --> 01:12:02,917
Of course,
I don't mind the going around part.

1322
01:12:03,093 --> 01:12:06,654
That gives me something to do
and since Mother...

1323
01:12:06,830 --> 01:12:09,298
Oh, what is it, tag day?

1324
01:12:09,466 --> 01:12:10,592
Oh, yes.

1325
01:12:10,767 --> 01:12:14,066
Yes. And I can't do it, I really can't.

1326
01:12:14,237 --> 01:12:17,434
You know, some of the girls
have gone over their quota three times.

1327
01:12:17,607 --> 01:12:21,475
But I just can't do a thing like that
unless I really like the man.

1328
01:12:21,644 --> 01:12:25,808
Oh, of course. Huh?

1329
01:12:25,982 --> 01:12:29,645
Well, it's all right for Mrs. Quimby,
Mrs. Sage Quimby to tell us how to do it.

1330
01:12:29,819 --> 01:12:32,083
But after all, all she has to do is tell us.

1331
01:12:32,822 --> 01:12:35,347
Exactly. Huh?

1332
01:12:35,959 --> 01:12:38,086
You see, the last time we had tag day...

1333
01:12:38,261 --> 01:12:41,492
...Mrs. Quimby got the idea
of having a kissing booth in the bazaar.

1334
01:12:41,898 --> 01:12:44,492
Then she thought
that if we girls went out in public...

1335
01:12:44,667 --> 01:12:47,465
...and did what the girls did
in the booth...

1336
01:12:47,637 --> 01:12:49,798
...we'd sell more tags, you see?

1337
01:12:49,973 --> 01:12:53,500
She made me promise
and, oh, I just can't do it.

1338
01:12:54,010 --> 01:12:57,104
No, that's all right.
I'll buy a tag and you...

1339
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,339
You don't have to kiss me
unless you want to.

1340
01:12:59,516 --> 01:13:01,882
Oh, but I promised Mrs. Quimby.

1341
01:13:02,051 --> 01:13:05,145
Well, that does complicate things,
doesn't it?

1342
01:13:05,321 --> 01:13:10,156
You don't like this kissing business,
and Mrs. Quimby says you have to, huh?

1343
01:13:10,326 --> 01:13:12,385
Oh, I didn't say I didn't like it.

1344
01:13:12,562 --> 01:13:14,427
Oh, no. No.

1345
01:13:14,597 --> 01:13:19,534
I just said that I couldn't do
a thing like that unless I meant it.

1346
01:13:19,702 --> 01:13:23,570
I'm sorry but that's the way I am.

1347
01:13:23,740 --> 01:13:25,935
Oh, but I mustn't take up
any more of your time.

1348
01:13:26,109 --> 01:13:27,337
No, no, no, sit down.

1349
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:29,501
I'd like to straighten things out.

1350
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:36,107
Now, suppose instead of you kissing me,
I kiss you on the hand, say?

1351
01:13:36,286 --> 01:13:37,617
Or on the cheek, maybe, huh?

1352
01:13:37,787 --> 01:13:40,051
And then you could tell
Mrs. What's-her-name...

1353
01:13:40,223 --> 01:13:41,690
...that everything's all right.

1354
01:13:41,858 --> 01:13:43,553
Oh, how much are the tags?

1355
01:13:43,726 --> 01:13:45,921
Five dollars. Six for 25.

1356
01:13:46,095 --> 01:13:48,222
I'll take six.

1357
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:52,265
There you are.

1358
01:13:52,435 --> 01:13:54,027
Now then.

1359
01:13:58,608 --> 01:13:59,632
What's the matter?

1360
01:13:59,809 --> 01:14:02,004
I've never been kissed like that
in all my life.

1361
01:14:02,178 --> 01:14:03,668
Well.

1362
01:14:03,847 --> 01:14:06,543
Oh, I think I could kiss you and mean it.

1363
01:14:06,716 --> 01:14:08,115
Yes.

1364
01:14:08,284 --> 01:14:12,687
Yes, I'm going to do
what Mrs. Quimby told me.

1365
01:14:17,827 --> 01:14:20,728
She's breaking my heart,
but she's reaching her quota.

1366
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:32,435
Good morning, afternoon, everybody.

1367
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:36,437
All right. Hold it, everybody, hold it.

1368
01:14:38,715 --> 01:14:39,909
Hello, boys.

1369
01:14:40,083 --> 01:14:42,677
- Everything all ready?
Why, certainly.

1370
01:14:42,852 --> 01:14:46,379
I declare, if it isn't nice
Mr. Wethered and Mr. Hugo too.

1371
01:14:46,556 --> 01:14:47,955
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

1372
01:14:48,124 --> 01:14:50,251
Yes, to be sure.

1373
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:53,929
Mr. Hugo and Mr. Wethered.

1374
01:14:54,097 --> 01:14:55,121
How do you do?

1375
01:14:55,298 --> 01:14:57,789
- A pleasure.
- Likewise.

1376
01:14:58,268 --> 01:15:00,930
Miss Larkin's got some great ideas
for the show.

1377
01:15:01,104 --> 01:15:02,799
Oh, is that so?

1378
01:15:02,972 --> 01:15:06,965
Yeah. Oh, by the way, I want you
to double Sally and Irene's salary.

1379
01:15:07,143 --> 01:15:08,576
Now, listen here, J. J...

1380
01:15:08,745 --> 01:15:10,906
Fix Miss Larkin up
with an expense account.

1381
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:12,069
Huh?

1382
01:15:12,248 --> 01:15:13,272
- Mr. Hobart.
- Yeah?

1383
01:15:13,449 --> 01:15:16,441
Gentlemen outside wanna see you.
One is your general manager.

1384
01:15:16,619 --> 01:15:19,679
Excuse me a minute, will you, folks?
I'll be right back.

1385
01:15:19,856 --> 01:15:20,880
- Morris.
Yes?

1386
01:15:21,057 --> 01:15:22,547
Break for 15 minutes.

1387
01:15:22,725 --> 01:15:24,522
Just a moment, Miss Larkin.

1388
01:15:24,694 --> 01:15:26,992
Now, if you will just step this way...

1389
01:15:27,163 --> 01:15:31,463
...we'll take up that little matter
of the expense account.

1390
01:15:31,634 --> 01:15:32,896
Good act, Gen.

1391
01:15:33,069 --> 01:15:34,093
I beg your pardon?

1392
01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:37,205
You can let your hair down,
and you could call me Morty too.

1393
01:15:37,373 --> 01:15:38,635
I really couldn't do that.

1394
01:15:38,808 --> 01:15:42,209
- Hey, what is this?
- I don't like your tone either, Mr. Hugo.

1395
01:15:42,378 --> 01:15:43,402
Cut out the act, Gen.

1396
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:46,174
We want to know,
have you been seeing J.J. Regularly?

1397
01:15:46,349 --> 01:15:47,941
That's a very personal question.

1398
01:15:48,117 --> 01:15:51,245
Well, we've got a right to be personal.
Who picked you for this job?

1399
01:15:51,421 --> 01:15:52,979
- Job?
- We made an agreement.

1400
01:15:53,156 --> 01:15:55,954
You were supposed to run J.J. Ragged.

1401
01:15:56,125 --> 01:15:57,956
How can you even think of such a thing?

1402
01:15:58,127 --> 01:16:00,322
J.J. Is one of the finest men
I've ever known...

1403
01:16:00,496 --> 01:16:04,296
...and I wouldn't do the least little thing
to hurt him, not the least little bit.

1404
01:16:04,467 --> 01:16:06,094
Are you double-crossing us?

1405
01:16:06,269 --> 01:16:08,134
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves...

1406
01:16:08,304 --> 01:16:11,137
...after all the nice things
he's going to do for you too.

1407
01:16:11,307 --> 01:16:12,331
- For us?
- For us?

1408
01:16:12,508 --> 01:16:16,274
Yes. Yes, he's thinking of transferring you
both to the Pittsburg Theatres.

1409
01:16:16,446 --> 01:16:18,437
Gen, I don't know what you're up to...

1410
01:16:18,615 --> 01:16:22,210
...but if you don't go through with this,
I'm gonna tell J.J. The whole story.

1411
01:16:22,385 --> 01:16:23,409
The whole story?

1412
01:16:23,586 --> 01:16:26,817
Oh, no. No, I don't think so.

1413
01:16:26,990 --> 01:16:30,619
You wouldn't want J.J. To think
you weren't loyal to him, would you?

1414
01:16:30,793 --> 01:16:36,322
And dear Mr. Wethered, you will remember
about that expense account, won't you?

1415
01:16:38,601 --> 01:16:42,367
Double-crossed by a fan dancer.

1416
01:16:42,538 --> 01:16:45,234
Come in, boys, come in.
Now, make yourself right at home.

1417
01:16:45,408 --> 01:16:46,875
Them is kind words, Mr. Hobart.

1418
01:16:47,043 --> 01:16:49,034
I've got a lot of swell ideas for the show.

1419
01:16:49,212 --> 01:16:51,112
Yeah? Well, we'll talk about those later.

1420
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:52,747
Now I have something on my mind.

1421
01:16:52,915 --> 01:16:55,850
- Do you know where Genevieve is?
- She went to her dressing room.

1422
01:16:56,019 --> 01:16:57,179
Thanks. Excuse me, boys.

1423
01:16:57,353 --> 01:16:58,718
Okay.

1424
01:16:59,656 --> 01:17:02,284
Hey, Boop, what's the first thing
a general manager does?

1425
01:17:02,458 --> 01:17:05,120
Well, if you don't know,
I'm not gonna tell you.

1426
01:17:08,064 --> 01:17:09,827
You mind if I sit down?

1427
01:17:09,999 --> 01:17:11,330
Of course not, darling.

1428
01:17:11,501 --> 01:17:13,594
I've been wondering
what's been keeping you.

1429
01:17:13,770 --> 01:17:17,763
Sort of miss you when you're not around,
and I wanted to have a talk with you.

1430
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:19,339
Jackie, you're an old darling.

1431
01:17:19,509 --> 01:17:23,036
You know, when I met you,
I think I fell into something.

1432
01:17:23,212 --> 01:17:26,375
You certainly did. The swimming pool.

1433
01:17:26,549 --> 01:17:28,073
No, I don't mean that.

1434
01:17:28,251 --> 01:17:30,981
But there's something about you I like.

1435
01:17:31,154 --> 01:17:33,179
I don't know what it is...

1436
01:17:33,356 --> 01:17:36,484
...but I get a great kick
out of doing things for you.

1437
01:17:36,659 --> 01:17:40,151
I want you to know that I appreciate
everything you do for me too, Jackie.

1438
01:17:40,697 --> 01:17:45,634
You know, Gen, all the years
when I didn't have anybody...

1439
01:17:45,802 --> 01:17:48,828
...this theater has been my only home.

1440
01:17:49,005 --> 01:17:51,337
I guess I was lonely.

1441
01:17:51,507 --> 01:17:53,134
I didn't know it.

1442
01:17:53,309 --> 01:17:57,609
I'd grown into a cross,
cranky old dum-dum.

1443
01:17:58,581 --> 01:18:00,708
Then you came along.

1444
01:18:00,883 --> 01:18:02,373
You done me a lot of good, Gen.

1445
01:18:02,552 --> 01:18:06,352
You made me think about a lot of things
I never thought of before.

1446
01:18:06,522 --> 01:18:11,323
And I haven't been lonely.

1447
01:18:11,494 --> 01:18:14,190
Now I'm grateful to you, Gen.

1448
01:18:14,363 --> 01:18:16,661
Oh, you shouldn't be grateful to me, J.J.

1449
01:18:16,833 --> 01:18:18,824
Oh, yes, I should.

1450
01:18:19,001 --> 01:18:21,595
You made me feel young all over again.

1451
01:18:21,771 --> 01:18:25,036
And I'm going on,
and do bigger things for your sake.

1452
01:18:25,208 --> 01:18:26,334
J.J., you're crazy.

1453
01:18:26,509 --> 01:18:27,999
No, I'm really serious.

1454
01:18:28,177 --> 01:18:30,543
And I mean it all decently, Gen.

1455
01:18:30,713 --> 01:18:32,738
Yes, I know you do.
That's just the trouble.

1456
01:18:32,915 --> 01:18:34,109
Why?

1457
01:18:34,283 --> 01:18:38,083
Well, you make me
so ashamed of myself.

1458
01:18:38,254 --> 01:18:40,381
J.J., I'm not what I pretended to be.

1459
01:18:41,491 --> 01:18:46,121
I know that. You didn't fool me any
about being a debutante and all that.

1460
01:18:46,562 --> 01:18:47,859
But that doesn't matter.

1461
01:18:48,030 --> 01:18:52,694
What really does matter
is I've grown terribly fond of you.

1462
01:18:52,869 --> 01:18:56,965
Oh, J.J., you're an old darling
that everybody's taking advantage of.

1463
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:59,131
Who's taking advantage of me?

1464
01:18:59,308 --> 01:19:01,708
Those precious partners of yours,
Wethered and Hugo.

1465
01:19:01,878 --> 01:19:07,282
- Why do you think they had you insured?
- My responsibilities, my family of 50 million.

1466
01:19:07,450 --> 01:19:09,111
Your family, my foot.

1467
01:19:09,285 --> 01:19:11,150
They insured you
because you'd fold up...

1468
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:13,982
...and they could collect the policy
and save their skins.

1469
01:19:14,157 --> 01:19:16,057
They sicced me on you
to wear you down.

1470
01:19:16,225 --> 01:19:18,489
That's the kind of partners
you've been good to...

1471
01:19:18,661 --> 01:19:20,925
...and the kind of a girl
you've been grateful to.

1472
01:19:21,097 --> 01:19:22,894
But why? Why did they do this?

1473
01:19:23,065 --> 01:19:25,761
Because they're broke.
They played with the firm's money.

1474
01:19:25,935 --> 01:19:27,926
They haven't enough left
to put on the show.

1475
01:19:28,104 --> 01:19:31,631
The last dime they had, they put
on the premium of your insurance policy.

1476
01:19:31,808 --> 01:19:36,507
You mean I'm broke?

1477
01:19:36,679 --> 01:19:39,671
Yes, J.J. Oh, I'm sorry, honestly.

1478
01:19:39,849 --> 01:19:41,908
After I got to know you,
I liked you so much.

1479
01:19:42,084 --> 01:19:45,349
I tried to tell you,
but I just couldn't get it out.

1480
01:19:45,955 --> 01:19:48,617
I'm broke.

1481
01:19:50,126 --> 01:19:51,787
J.J.

1482
01:19:52,295 --> 01:19:53,762
J.J.

1483
01:19:53,930 --> 01:19:55,989
Oh, J.J.

1484
01:19:56,165 --> 01:19:58,429
Help. Help.

1485
01:19:58,601 --> 01:20:00,592
Help. Help.

1486
01:20:00,770 --> 01:20:02,829
- What's happened?
- J.J.'s had a stroke.

1487
01:20:03,005 --> 01:20:05,599
- Where is he?
- Oh, come quick in here.

1488
01:20:07,310 --> 01:20:08,402
J.J.

1489
01:20:08,578 --> 01:20:10,546
- J.J.
- Come on, crowd around, girls.

1490
01:20:10,713 --> 01:20:11,771
Don't give him any air.

1491
01:20:11,948 --> 01:20:13,472
Oh, J.J., what's the matter?

1492
01:20:13,649 --> 01:20:15,173
J.J. Boop, get a doctor.

1493
01:20:15,351 --> 01:20:17,785
Get an ambulance. Hurry, hurry.

1494
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:28,720
All right, stand back.

1495
01:20:28,898 --> 01:20:30,832
All right.

1496
01:20:33,202 --> 01:20:34,863
How did it happen?

1497
01:20:35,037 --> 01:20:36,937
Genevieve told him he was broke.

1498
01:20:37,106 --> 01:20:40,269
Well, why didn't we think of that?

1499
01:20:46,749 --> 01:20:48,478
- You may come in now.
- Thank you.

1500
01:20:48,651 --> 01:20:50,744
Just the four of you,
and don't stay too long.

1501
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:53,388
- Yes, thank you.
- Oh, J.J., darling.

1502
01:20:53,556 --> 01:20:56,457
- How do you feel?
- Terrible.

1503
01:20:56,626 --> 01:20:58,184
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1504
01:20:58,361 --> 01:21:01,159
Oh, now, please, Gen. Please don't.

1505
01:21:01,330 --> 01:21:02,922
It isn't your fault.

1506
01:21:03,099 --> 01:21:05,192
Don't worry.
We're with you, broke or not.

1507
01:21:05,368 --> 01:21:08,030
Don't forget, J.J., life begins at 59.

1508
01:21:08,204 --> 01:21:10,729
Remember, Mr. Hobart,
the mongrel's hole may slip...

1509
01:21:10,907 --> 01:21:13,102
...but only crowbars
loose the bulldog's grip.

1510
01:21:13,809 --> 01:21:16,141
You and your crowbars.

1511
01:21:16,312 --> 01:21:19,679
Oh, let me alone, let me die in peace.

1512
01:21:19,849 --> 01:21:22,317
J.J., don't say that.
That's not the right spirit.

1513
01:21:22,485 --> 01:21:24,248
No, sir. You've just gotta get better.

1514
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:26,650
Especially before your next premium
comes due.

1515
01:21:26,822 --> 01:21:30,053
What's the use?
What have I got to live for?

1516
01:21:30,226 --> 01:21:31,750
Why, everything, everything, J.J.

1517
01:21:31,928 --> 01:21:34,624
You're just in the prime of life.
You're right at the peak.

1518
01:21:34,797 --> 01:21:37,994
Why, you'll soon be the old hard-fisted,
fire-eating producer again.

1519
01:21:38,167 --> 01:21:39,794
Think of your responsibilities.

1520
01:21:39,969 --> 01:21:41,596
Think of the audiences of America.

1521
01:21:41,771 --> 01:21:44,001
The millions of them. Think of posterity.

1522
01:21:44,173 --> 01:21:47,404
Well, you can't let them down.
You may be broke but you've got us...

1523
01:21:47,576 --> 01:21:50,943
...and we'll get together and put you
back on your feet where you belong.

1524
01:21:51,113 --> 01:21:54,139
We'll put you on your feet
with the greatest show you ever saw.

1525
01:21:54,317 --> 01:21:56,148
With the greatest show
anybody ever saw.

1526
01:21:56,319 --> 01:21:59,948
We'll have millions standing on their feet,
cheering the name of J.J. Hobart.

1527
01:22:01,290 --> 01:22:02,723
- There he goes again.
- J.J., J.J.

1528
01:22:02,892 --> 01:22:04,416
- Oh, J.J., darling.
- J.J.

1529
01:22:06,128 --> 01:22:07,459
Please, you have to leave.

1530
01:22:07,630 --> 01:22:08,927
J.J.

1531
01:22:11,367 --> 01:22:12,800
Is he all right?

1532
01:22:12,969 --> 01:22:14,800
Well, he's terrible, in terrible shape.

1533
01:22:14,971 --> 01:22:17,531
- Rosmer, how we gonna do?
- Yes, how are we gonna do it?

1534
01:22:17,707 --> 01:22:19,402
I don't know now.

1535
01:22:19,575 --> 01:22:21,668
Attention, girls.

1536
01:22:21,844 --> 01:22:24,972
I suppose that you're all aware
of the distressing position...

1537
01:22:25,147 --> 01:22:26,876
...that Mr. Hobart has placed us in.

1538
01:22:27,516 --> 01:22:30,212
So there's scarcely any need
of going into it any further.

1539
01:22:30,386 --> 01:22:32,650
I can only say
on behalf of Mr. Hugo and myself...

1540
01:22:32,822 --> 01:22:35,484
...that we're extremely sorry.

1541
01:22:35,658 --> 01:22:39,059
You know how close J.J. Was to us.

1542
01:22:39,228 --> 01:22:42,493
And the fact that he could place us
in this unfortunate situation...

1543
01:22:42,665 --> 01:22:44,030
...wounds us deeply.

1544
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:48,261
Nevertheless, I'm forced to announce
that rehearsals will be discontinued.

1545
01:22:50,406 --> 01:22:51,430
Wait.

1546
01:22:53,676 --> 01:22:54,904
Take care of them, Boop.

1547
01:22:55,411 --> 01:22:57,811
- Oh, what's the meaning of this?
- Shut your face.

1548
01:22:57,980 --> 01:22:59,447
- This is an outrage.
- Keep quiet.

1549
01:22:59,615 --> 01:23:00,707
Yes, keep quiet.

1550
01:23:01,150 --> 01:23:03,948
Boys and girls,
I don't know what you've been told.

1551
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:07,214
But it's no fault of J.J.'s
that this show is on the rocks.

1552
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:10,757
His only mistake was in trusting
the financial matters of this company...

1553
01:23:10,926 --> 01:23:12,518
...to these two crooks here.

1554
01:23:14,230 --> 01:23:18,257
I just came from the hospital
where J.J. Is flat on his back...

1555
01:23:18,434 --> 01:23:22,165
...holding on to one thread
with the hope that this show will open...

1556
01:23:22,338 --> 01:23:25,000
...and get him out of the hole
that these two put him in.

1557
01:23:25,174 --> 01:23:27,369
Now, I promised him
that we'd put the show on.

1558
01:23:27,543 --> 01:23:29,977
I don't know exactly
how it's gonna be done...

1559
01:23:30,146 --> 01:23:33,172
...but it's got to be done,
because it means his life.

1560
01:23:33,349 --> 01:23:34,475
So it's up to us.

1561
01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:37,619
Now, the cast has walked out
but if you'll stick...

1562
01:23:37,787 --> 01:23:39,652
...I know we can put it on.

1563
01:23:39,822 --> 01:23:44,122
And now, if you feel a sense of loyalty
to a grand old man of the theater...

1564
01:23:44,293 --> 01:23:46,284
...here's your chance to give him help.

1565
01:23:46,462 --> 01:23:48,327
- Are you with us?
Sure.

1566
01:23:49,165 --> 01:23:51,565
Swell.
Then there's one thing to be done first.

1567
01:23:51,734 --> 01:23:52,996
Come on.

1568
01:24:01,610 --> 01:24:04,135
Ten thousand dollars?
Do you think I'm crazy?

1569
01:24:04,313 --> 01:24:07,680
Andy, I think you were a bit cracked.
Now I think you're completely gone.

1570
01:24:07,850 --> 01:24:09,044
Which would you rather do?

1571
01:24:09,218 --> 01:24:12,210
Put 10,000 in the show,
or pay out 1 million in insurance?

1572
01:24:12,388 --> 01:24:13,912
- Maybe he won't die.
- But he will.

1573
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:17,321
If this show doesn't go on,
he's the guy that will glory in his grave.

1574
01:24:17,493 --> 01:24:19,393
There will be no peace
for the loved ones.

1575
01:24:19,562 --> 01:24:21,655
Only the wailing
of an insurance company...

1576
01:24:21,831 --> 01:24:23,731
...to the tune of one million smackers.

1577
01:24:23,899 --> 01:24:25,526
How did I ever get in this?

1578
01:24:26,335 --> 01:24:28,735
Well, never mind how you got in it.
Get out of it.

1579
01:24:28,904 --> 01:24:30,769
You wouldn't take 5000, would you?

1580
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:33,306
Ten thousand or 1 million.

1581
01:24:34,009 --> 01:24:36,341
This used to be a great business
in the old days.

1582
01:24:36,512 --> 01:24:38,810
Optimism, that's what you need.
Do or die.

1583
01:24:38,981 --> 01:24:40,881
Sink or swim.

1584
01:24:41,584 --> 01:24:43,518
Shut up.

1585
01:24:43,686 --> 01:24:46,450
Wouldn't Reginald
make a marvelous impresario?

1586
01:24:46,622 --> 01:24:49,819
It would be just too thrilling
to have him actually in show business.

1587
01:24:49,992 --> 01:24:53,553
Maybe Reginald
will let us exhibit him in the lobby.

1588
01:24:54,096 --> 01:24:58,260
Now, you just write out a check, honey,
and we'll take care of everything.

1589
01:24:58,767 --> 01:25:00,826
And what's more,
I might tell Aunt Matilda...

1590
01:25:01,003 --> 01:25:03,597
...what happened that time
you got drunk in Cleveland.

1591
01:25:03,772 --> 01:25:06,673
Certainly, Boop. Glad to help out.

1592
01:25:06,842 --> 01:25:09,709
I had forgotten about Cleveland.

1593
01:25:09,879 --> 01:25:13,508
Hello, darling.
I have a marvelous surprise for you.

1594
01:25:13,682 --> 01:25:15,741
You're going in show business.

1595
01:25:15,918 --> 01:25:18,682
No, not me. You.

1596
01:25:18,854 --> 01:25:20,617
I'm gonna let you be an angel.

1597
01:25:20,789 --> 01:25:25,624
And, honey,
the scenery will only cost $ 10,000.

1598
01:25:25,794 --> 01:25:27,887
It isn't exactly a charity, darling.

1599
01:25:28,063 --> 01:25:30,463
Just make it out to the Hobart Theatre.

1600
01:25:30,633 --> 01:25:32,760
Oh, honey, I forgot to tell you.

1601
01:25:32,935 --> 01:25:34,869
I sold your automobile this morning.

1602
01:25:35,037 --> 01:25:38,495
And we're all gonna chip in
everything we have.

1603
01:25:38,674 --> 01:25:40,471
Hello? Yes.

1604
01:25:40,643 --> 01:25:44,511
You better give me a check, or there will be
three at your house for dinner tonight.

1605
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:47,205
You, your wife and me.

1606
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:59,027
Come on, hurry up, will you?

1607
01:25:59,195 --> 01:26:01,288
- Boop.
- Hello, babe.

1608
01:26:01,463 --> 01:26:03,988
When are we gonna get married?
My mother wants to know.

1609
01:26:04,166 --> 01:26:07,033
Now, don't you worry.
If this show's a hit, we'll get married.

1610
01:26:07,203 --> 01:26:09,103
We'll get married or nothing.

1611
01:26:11,574 --> 01:26:13,474
Hey, Milt, don't forget that floodlight.

1612
01:26:13,642 --> 01:26:15,041
- I'll take care of it.
- Thanks.

1613
01:26:15,211 --> 01:26:16,678
- Hello.
- Is everything all right?

1614
01:26:16,845 --> 01:26:18,574
I think so.
Angel's wings didn't come.

1615
01:26:18,747 --> 01:26:22,205
Mule refuses to be painted like a zebra.
Second act scenery got rained on.

1616
01:26:22,384 --> 01:26:25,649
Character woman's got hiccups.
Dancer can't find his tights or partner.

1617
01:26:25,821 --> 01:26:29,757
- Outside of that, everything's all right.
- Don't worry, the show's gonna be swell.

1618
01:26:29,925 --> 01:26:30,949
Well, it better be.

1619
01:26:31,126 --> 01:26:33,458
You know what it will mean
if it flops to J. J?

1620
01:26:33,629 --> 01:26:35,722
Well, it can't flop. Don't even think of it.

1621
01:26:35,898 --> 01:26:37,490
Think of the audiences of America.

1622
01:26:37,666 --> 01:26:40,567
Think of the millions
that will be there standing and cheering.

1623
01:26:40,736 --> 01:26:43,034
Think of posterity.
Oh, Ross, I'm so scared.

1624
01:26:43,205 --> 01:26:45,867
Don't you be scared.
It's a good show, you're swell in it.

1625
01:26:46,041 --> 01:26:48,532
You can't miss. You're like Joan of Arc.

1626
01:26:48,711 --> 01:26:51,305
Yeah. But, honey, they burned her.

1627
01:26:52,982 --> 01:26:54,882
I'm surprised at you breaking up so.

1628
01:26:55,050 --> 01:26:56,449
I just couldn't help it.

1629
01:26:56,619 --> 01:26:59,452
It was so moving,
so touching and beautiful.

1630
01:26:59,622 --> 01:27:01,988
I've never seen
a ceremony like that before.

1631
01:27:03,859 --> 01:27:05,622
Answer the phone.

1632
01:27:12,568 --> 01:27:13,899
Hello?

1633
01:27:14,069 --> 01:27:15,536
Hello. Is Mr. Hobart there?

1634
01:27:15,704 --> 01:27:19,196
No. They've all gone.

1635
01:27:19,375 --> 01:27:21,002
They've all gone? Who?

1636
01:27:21,176 --> 01:27:23,303
The reporters and everybody.

1637
01:27:23,479 --> 01:27:24,741
The reporters?

1638
01:27:24,913 --> 01:27:27,404
What's the matter?
Something wrong with Mr. Hobart?

1639
01:27:27,583 --> 01:27:29,107
Yes. He...

1640
01:27:29,285 --> 01:27:30,309
He...

1641
01:27:30,486 --> 01:27:33,717
Oh, Mr. Hobart has gone on?

1642
01:27:34,189 --> 01:27:35,850
Yes.

1643
01:27:37,593 --> 01:27:38,890
Oh.

1644
01:27:42,531 --> 01:27:44,396
Ross, what's the matter?

1645
01:27:44,566 --> 01:27:46,056
Old J.J. Has gone.

1646
01:27:46,235 --> 01:27:48,294
You mean he's...
Fifteen minutes.

1647
01:27:48,470 --> 01:27:51,405
- Well, we can't put the show on now.
- Of course not.

1648
01:27:51,573 --> 01:27:52,597
Fifteen minutes.

1649
01:27:52,775 --> 01:27:54,242
Hey, wait a minute. Kids.

1650
01:27:54,410 --> 01:27:56,241
Kids, come here, will you?

1651
01:27:56,412 --> 01:27:57,879
Come here.

1652
01:28:00,316 --> 01:28:02,648
Whole thing's called off.
There will be no show.

1653
01:28:02,818 --> 01:28:03,910
What?

1654
01:28:04,086 --> 01:28:07,283
- Tell them to give the money back.
- What's the matter? Are you crazy?

1655
01:28:07,456 --> 01:28:09,651
No, I'm not crazy.
We can't put the show on now.

1656
01:28:09,825 --> 01:28:12,521
You see, old J.J. Hobart is gone.

1657
01:28:12,695 --> 01:28:14,060
Gone?

1658
01:28:14,229 --> 01:28:15,890
Well, he...

1659
01:28:18,267 --> 01:28:20,633
- J.J.
- Mr. Hobart.

1660
01:28:20,803 --> 01:28:23,067
- Mr. Hobart.
J.J.

1661
01:28:23,238 --> 01:28:24,330
Are we glad to see you.

1662
01:28:24,506 --> 01:28:25,530
Hello, folks.

1663
01:28:25,708 --> 01:28:27,972
Well, you did it, didn't you? Good work.

1664
01:28:28,143 --> 01:28:32,273
And now,
I have some broadcasting to do.

1665
01:28:32,681 --> 01:28:35,206
This is J.J. Hobart speaking.

1666
01:28:35,384 --> 01:28:38,182
We had the ceremony performed
in the hospital...

1667
01:28:38,354 --> 01:28:41,323
...and I felt so good about it,
I had to come over and tell you.

1668
01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:45,449
I want you to meet Mrs. J.J. Hobart.

1669
01:28:45,994 --> 01:28:47,518
Congratulations, congratulations.

1670
01:28:47,696 --> 01:28:51,132
Well, say, what about the show?
It's late, isn't it?

1671
01:28:51,467 --> 01:28:53,298
That's right.
You get into your costume.

1672
01:28:53,469 --> 01:28:56,063
- The curtain goes up on time.
- Come on, everybody.

1673
01:28:56,238 --> 01:28:57,262
Here we go.

1674
01:28:57,439 --> 01:28:59,634
Boy, are we glad to see you.

1675
01:29:08,450 --> 01:29:10,850
I'm afraid this excitement
will be too much for you.

1676
01:29:11,019 --> 01:29:13,817
- Maybe we better go back to the hospital.
- Hospital, nothing.

1677
01:29:13,989 --> 01:29:16,150
Here. Take this thing away.

1678
01:29:16,325 --> 01:29:19,055
After the show,
we're going out to a nightclub.

1679
01:29:19,228 --> 01:29:21,355
Life begins at 59.

1680
01:29:21,530 --> 01:29:22,758
Don't forget that, Gen.

1681
01:29:22,931 --> 01:29:24,762
That's the curtain.

1682
01:29:42,050 --> 01:29:44,450
<i>The soldiers of the world
Can conquer you</i>

1683
01:29:44,620 --> 01:29:47,316
<i>With powder and with steel</i>

1684
01:29:49,892 --> 01:29:52,019
<i>The women of the world
Can do the same</i>

1685
01:29:52,194 --> 01:29:55,027
<i>With charm and sex appeal</i>

1686
01:29:56,465 --> 01:29:59,832
<i>A soldier must be patriotic</i>

1687
01:30:00,402 --> 01:30:04,805
<i>A woman's got to be exotic</i>

1688
01:30:05,307 --> 01:30:07,707
<i>A kiss is deadly
As the cannon's roar</i>

1689
01:30:07,876 --> 01:30:12,472
<i>In fact I fear it more than warfare</i>

1690
01:30:12,648 --> 01:30:14,741
<i>The battlefield's a rocking chair</i>

1691
01:30:14,917 --> 01:30:20,514
<i>Look out, look out
For all is fair in love and war</i>

1692
01:30:20,689 --> 01:30:22,589
<i>Just like a bombshell from the air</i>

1693
01:30:22,758 --> 01:30:28,128
<i>A kiss can blow you up
Beware of love and war</i>

1694
01:30:28,997 --> 01:30:31,693
<i>Two arms can squeeze you senseless</i>

1695
01:30:31,867 --> 01:30:36,634
<i>You're defenseless in the dark</i>

1696
01:30:36,805 --> 01:30:39,672
<i>Two eyes
Two brown or blue eyes</i>

1697
01:30:39,842 --> 01:30:42,037
<i>If they do invite you</i>

1698
01:30:42,211 --> 01:30:44,008
<i>They'll dynamite you</i>

1699
01:30:44,179 --> 01:30:47,842
<i>And with your back against the wall
She marches you to City Hall</i>

1700
01:30:48,016 --> 01:30:51,281
<i>And leads you through the door</i>

1701
01:30:51,453 --> 01:30:55,253
<i>And then the deed is done
Her victory is won</i>

1702
01:30:55,424 --> 01:30:59,690
<i>For love is just like war</i>

1703
01:30:59,862 --> 01:31:01,693
<i>The battlefield's a rocking chair</i>

1704
01:31:01,864 --> 01:31:07,803
<i>Look out, look out
For all is fair in love and war</i>

1705
01:31:08,036 --> 01:31:09,799
<i>Just like a bombshell from the air</i>

1706
01:31:09,972 --> 01:31:16,400
<i>A kiss can blow you up
Beware of love and war</i>

1707
01:31:16,578 --> 01:31:19,411
<i>Two arms can squeeze you senseless</i>

1708
01:31:19,581 --> 01:31:23,950
<i>You're defenseless in the dark</i>

1709
01:31:24,586 --> 01:31:27,487
<i>Two eyes
Two brown or blue eyes</i>

1710
01:31:27,656 --> 01:31:32,150
<i>If they do invite you
They'll dynamite you</i>

1711
01:31:32,327 --> 01:31:35,922
<i>And with your back against the wall
She marches you to City Hall</i>

1712
01:31:36,098 --> 01:31:39,431
<i>And leads you through the door</i>

1713
01:31:39,601 --> 01:31:43,469
<i>And then the deed is done
Her victory is won</i>

1714
01:31:43,639 --> 01:31:47,632
<i>For love is just like war</i>

1715
01:31:48,510 --> 01:31:52,412
<i>If I could snare some millionaire
I'd have a lovely love affair</i>

1716
01:31:52,581 --> 01:31:55,141
<i>For he's the kind of man I could adore</i>

1717
01:31:55,317 --> 01:31:56,511
Oh, yes, yes.

1718
01:31:56,685 --> 01:32:00,280
<i>I wouldn't care if he's a wreck
As long as he could sign a check</i>

1719
01:32:00,455 --> 01:32:03,822
<i>And keep the wolf away
From my front door</i>

1720
01:32:04,793 --> 01:32:06,693
<i>I'd be willing to take my chances</i>

1721
01:32:06,862 --> 01:32:09,763
<i>If his finances were okay
I'd make him pay</i>

1722
01:32:09,932 --> 01:32:12,924
Or am I too brutal? Maybe.

1723
01:32:13,101 --> 01:32:15,501
<i>I'd encourage his bold advances</i>

1724
01:32:15,671 --> 01:32:18,105
<i>If he got reckless, I'd get a necklace</i>

1725
01:32:18,273 --> 01:32:20,537
Diamonds and things.

1726
01:32:20,709 --> 01:32:25,237
<i>A nice old man with lots of wealth
Who isn't in the best of health</i>

1727
01:32:25,414 --> 01:32:28,178
<i>Who could ask for more?
See what I mean?</i>

1728
01:32:28,350 --> 01:32:32,286
<i>A sudden love attack,
And I'd have all his jack</i>

1729
01:32:32,454 --> 01:32:36,254
<i>For love is just like war</i>

1730
01:36:01,096 --> 01:36:02,620
<i>The battlefield's a rocking chair</i>

1731
01:36:02,798 --> 01:36:07,599
<i>Look out, look out,
For all is fair in love and war</i>

1732
01:36:07,769 --> 01:36:09,100
<i>A smile may be the camouflage</i>

1733
01:36:09,271 --> 01:36:14,436
<i>That comes before the big barrage
In love and war</i>

1734
01:36:14,609 --> 01:36:21,071
<i>Drilling can be so thrilling
If you're willing to obey</i>

1735
01:36:21,316 --> 01:36:23,614
<i>Round you, her arms surround you</i>

1736
01:36:23,785 --> 01:36:27,414
<i>Though you may maneuver
You'll never move her</i>

1737
01:36:27,589 --> 01:36:30,752
<i>If you escape a rocking chair
Then you deserve a Croix de Guerre</i>

1738
01:36:30,926 --> 01:36:33,690
<i>Or two or three or four</i>

1739
01:36:33,862 --> 01:36:36,990
<i>And after you've been kissed
I know that you'll enlist</i>

1740
01:36:37,165 --> 01:36:40,623
<i>For love is just like war</i>

1741
01:39:44,619 --> 01:39:46,109
<i>And with your back against the wall</i>

1742
01:39:46,287 --> 01:39:47,549
<i>She marches you to City Hall</i>

1743
01:39:47,722 --> 01:39:50,691
<i>And leads you through the door</i>

1744
01:39:50,859 --> 01:39:53,851
<i>And then the deed is done
Her victory is won</i>

1745
01:39:54,029 --> 01:40:02,198
<i>For love is just like war</i>
