1
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,867
Mammy, we're almost through
with the picking.

2
00:02:06,142 --> 00:02:09,236
Yes, sir! And we done put in
a good season's work.

3
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:10,941
- Zeke.
- Ma'am?

4
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:13,574
You got all of them things that you
got to buy in town tomorrow?

5
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,777
Yes, Mammy, I've got them right here.

6
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:17,145
Here it is, Mammy.

7
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,988
Why, here's a nice shirt for Pappy...

8
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,950
and a pair of pants for Spunk.

9
00:02:24,494 --> 00:02:25,984
You knows you just joking.

10
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,588
Why, I never had no new pants in my life.

11
00:02:29,165 --> 00:02:31,599
Why, as soon as you goes out 'em,
I stepped in.

12
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:37,632
- And a dress for Missy Rose...
- Oh, Zeke, what kind?

13
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,373
It ain't gonna be no wedding dress
and you needn't be...

14
00:02:40,443 --> 00:02:41,967
asking me for none neither.

15
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:43,706
Ain't nobody asked you
for no wedding dress.

16
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,805
- Who'd marry you?
- Why, you would.

17
00:02:46,115 --> 00:02:48,345
What does you think
Mammy adopted you for...

18
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,045
except so you could marry me?

19
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:52,553
- She didn't do nothing, did you Mammy?
- Course she did.

20
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:55,248
Oh, children, don't you all fuss.

21
00:02:55,491 --> 00:02:57,152
Zeke, what you gonna bring the children?

22
00:02:57,994 --> 00:03:00,087
I don't see nothing on here for Sears.

23
00:03:00,463 --> 00:03:01,725
Not a thing?

24
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:03,962
Nor Roebuck.

25
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,594
Gee whiz!

26
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:07,661
Nor Coe.

27
00:03:08,204 --> 00:03:10,069
Did you done forgot?

28
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,730
Oh, don't tease them, Zeke.

29
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:16,002
Don't I see a new bright pocket knife
hanging on that string?

30
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:21,573
And a whole lot of marbles.

31
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,107
That's right!

32
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:26,911
And a big pack of chewing gum.

33
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,112
Yes.

34
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:30,989
I believe you sure is right, Mammy.

35
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,460
But what you want me to bring you
from town, Mammy?

36
00:03:33,529 --> 00:03:35,258
You's always leaving yourself out.

37
00:03:35,331 --> 00:03:38,562
- Don't matter about me, son.
- Yes'm, it do.

38
00:03:39,168 --> 00:03:40,430
Well, looky here.

39
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:44,539
Here's a straw hat with a whole lot of
feathers on it for you, Mammy.

40
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:49,735
And a pair of them shiny gold spectacles.

41
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,643
Don't bring me nothing, son.

42
00:03:55,084 --> 00:03:57,518
Mammy, I can't buy nothing.

43
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,349
I got to buy you something.

44
00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:02,753
Why, there ain't no "nothing" to buy.

45
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,356
Well, all right then. Anything you choose.

46
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:12,596
<i>Oh, cotton</i>

47
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,001
<i>Hey, cotton</i>

48
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:16,732
<i>Oh, cotton</i>

49
00:04:25,815 --> 00:04:29,911
<i>Cotton</i>

50
00:04:57,814 --> 00:05:00,078
"...have no other God before me.

51
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:03,880
"Thou shalt not make unto thee
any graven image or any likeness...

52
00:05:03,953 --> 00:05:07,650
"of any thing that is in heaven above,
or that is in the earth beneath...

53
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:11,091
"or that is in the water under the earth.
Thou shall not bow..."

54
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,685
- Hello, Henry.
- Hello, folks.

55
00:05:13,763 --> 00:05:17,699
Come on, Henry. We got a great big dish
of chitlins just waiting for you.

56
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:19,797
Everybody loves chitlins.

57
00:05:19,869 --> 00:05:23,361
Henry, I sure am glad to see you.
Sit right down and make yourself at home.

58
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,669
Every time I see you,
you got that old banjo with you.

59
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,711
- What's the matter with...
- Better put that old starvation box down...

60
00:05:28,778 --> 00:05:30,678
you gonna have a lot of trouble,
some of these days.

61
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,942
What you talking about, man?
This banjo is my best friend.

62
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:34,381
- What you talking about?
- How come it is?

63
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,714
Why sure, you know what I did?
Just here, last week, I told this old banjo:

64
00:05:38,788 --> 00:05:42,246
"Banjo, I'm tired
of telling time by the old sun."

65
00:05:42,992 --> 00:05:45,051
I said, "I wants me a watch."

66
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:47,053
Well, what did it do?

67
00:05:47,864 --> 00:05:52,130
- Here it is.
- Let me see it. Look at that, Pappy.

68
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:53,930
- That sure is a good watch.
- Look at that baby!

69
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:55,868
You sure is lucky to get a watch like that.

70
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:59,066
Mammy, it's alive. I hear its heart beating.

71
00:05:59,142 --> 00:06:00,234
Let me hear it.

72
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:02,072
You're just lucky.
I don't believe you stole it.

73
00:06:02,145 --> 00:06:04,477
- Fine watch.
- Don't you know, this thing's ticking.

74
00:06:04,547 --> 00:06:06,777
- Sure, it's going to tick.
- Let me look at it, then.

75
00:06:09,018 --> 00:06:11,077
What time is by your watch, Henry?

76
00:06:15,491 --> 00:06:16,981
There it is.

77
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,857
Sure is.

78
00:06:22,865 --> 00:06:24,856
It sure is.

79
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:27,862
Henry, if you ain't gonna eat
none of these chitlins...

80
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:29,461
we gonna clear away the table.

81
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:31,404
- Yes.
- We sure is.

82
00:06:32,075 --> 00:06:35,374
- Come on, boys. Let's have a little dance.
- I'm gonna do good.

83
00:08:23,152 --> 00:08:26,349
Hello, Adam and Eve.
What are you doing around here?

84
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:30,023
Well, we just come down to see
if you had time to marry us.

85
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,184
That's right.

86
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,522
- To marry you?
- Yes.

87
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,358
Ain't these eleven children yours?

88
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,597
That's right.
And we thought it was about time...

89
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:39,328
for us to make it more permanent.

90
00:08:39,402 --> 00:08:40,494
That's right.

91
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,100
Seems like you made it mighty late
getting round here to be married.

92
00:08:44,173 --> 00:08:46,437
- The damage is all done.
- It sure is.

93
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:48,568
But could you fix us up, anyhow?

94
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,102
Well, it's never too late
to do the will of the Lord.

95
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,614
That's right. That's right.

96
00:08:55,585 --> 00:08:59,180
Well, children, I certainly is glad to see
you all done make up your minds...

97
00:08:59,255 --> 00:09:00,347
to do the right thing.

98
00:09:00,423 --> 00:09:03,290
Thank you. 'Cause you know,
I've always been a respectable woman...

99
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:06,123
and I don't want that to come up
against my character.

100
00:09:06,195 --> 00:09:08,493
Oh, it ain't what you was.
It's what you is today.

101
00:09:08,564 --> 00:09:10,464
Look here,
you ain't got on no wedding veil.

102
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:12,467
I ain't gonna marry you in no wedding veil.

103
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:14,833
- Now, Missy, go get the veil.
- Yes.

104
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:21,035
I guess we'll conduct this
marriage ceremony right around there...

105
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:24,102
under that tree.
Just follow me round here.

106
00:09:27,683 --> 00:09:29,810
The Lord is with us to see this wedding.

107
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,717
- Look like you're gonna have your way.
- That's right.

108
00:09:35,891 --> 00:09:38,359
Venus, come
and be your Pappy's best man.

109
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:44,789
Here, boy, come on round here.
You look more like your mammy...

110
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:46,027
every day.

111
00:10:30,646 --> 00:10:33,376
...in the time of man's innocence...

112
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,711
signifying unto us the mystical union...

113
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:41,120
that is between Christ and his church.

114
00:10:41,957 --> 00:10:44,824
- Which holy estate Christ adorned...
- Hello, Zeke.

115
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:47,496
Come on, kiss me, Missy Rose.

116
00:10:48,597 --> 00:10:52,693
...and first miracle that he wrought
in Cana of Galilee.

117
00:10:52,768 --> 00:10:55,430
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with your eyes?

118
00:10:55,504 --> 00:10:57,904
- Don't look at me like that.
- I been looking at you all day.

119
00:10:57,973 --> 00:10:59,964
You sure do look good tonight,
Missy Rose.

120
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:01,703
Oh, Zeke, don't do that.

121
00:11:02,044 --> 00:11:04,342
- Come on, kiss me.
- Don't do that, Zeke.

122
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:06,745
- Come on, kiss me.
- Don't do that.

123
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:08,005
Oh, Zeke.

124
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:11,144
...or lightly, but reverently.

125
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,518
- Man and wife.
- Amen.

126
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,762
The wedding's all over. They're married.
Come on out and kiss the bride.

127
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:30,195
Excuse me, Missy Rose, but it looks like
the devil's in me here tonight.

128
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:35,069
That's all right, Zeke. I'll forgive you.

129
00:11:36,178 --> 00:11:37,440
Go ahead, my son.

130
00:11:38,714 --> 00:11:40,944
- Ready, Henry?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

131
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,661
- That's it.
- Oh, yeah!

132
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:10,644
<i>Sweet little baby</i>

133
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:21,055
Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

134
00:12:21,123 --> 00:12:25,719
If I should die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take.

135
00:12:25,895 --> 00:12:27,419
Bless Mammy and Pappy.

136
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:30,624
Bless Missy Rose,
Brother Zeke and Spunk.

137
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:34,100
Bless Sears, Roebuck and Coe. Amen.

138
00:12:42,378 --> 00:12:45,313
<i>Hush you bye</i>

139
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:49,312
<i>Don't you cry</i>

140
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:52,983
<i>Go to sleep</i>

141
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:56,190
<i>Little baby</i>

142
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,526
<i>You shall have</i>

143
00:13:01,163 --> 00:13:05,293
<i>All the horses in the pasture</i>

144
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:10,494
<i>They belong to Mammy's little baby</i>

145
00:13:36,332 --> 00:13:39,165
<i>Go to sleep</i>

146
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,564
<i>Little baby</i>

147
00:14:01,056 --> 00:14:02,455
Now, get up there. Here, here, here.

148
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:06,457
Go along. Go to bed. You're old enough
to go to bed by yourself.

149
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,536
- Goodnight, Mammy.
- Goodnight.

150
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:21,968
- Goodnight, Mammy.
- Goodnight, Spunk.

151
00:14:23,145 --> 00:14:25,409
- Goodnight, Pappy.
- Goodnight, Missy.

152
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:27,912
- Goodnight, Mammy.
- Goodnight, Zeke.

153
00:14:27,983 --> 00:14:29,848
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Lord, grant me.

154
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:33,279
- Goodnight, Zeke.
- Goodnight. Sleep tight.

155
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:35,881
- Goodnight, Pappy.
- Goodnight, Zeke.

156
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,858
- Goodnight, Pappy.
- Goodnight, Spunk.

157
00:14:51,941 --> 00:14:53,499
Thank God.

158
00:14:58,514 --> 00:15:00,243
These mules are so stubborn.

159
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,776
Stop right here.

160
00:15:02,851 --> 00:15:04,819
- Whoa there, mule.
- Take it down to Veteran Smith.

161
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:10,391
Let us give thanks
for our success this year.

162
00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:13,089
Let us kneel right down here.

163
00:15:14,563 --> 00:15:18,158
We is most grateful for this
bountiful crop, O Lord...

164
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:20,793
- Yes, sir.
...and we trust you won't be offended...

165
00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:23,235
- No.
...if we just ask one favor more.

166
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,972
Please, Lord, let us get a good price...

167
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:28,737
- for our cotton.
- Do pray, Lord.

168
00:15:28,811 --> 00:15:31,405
- Amen.
- Amen.

169
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,014
- Don't forget the flour and the pepper.
- All right.

170
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:38,178
- Buy me my chewing gum.
- Don't forget my bowie knife.

171
00:15:38,253 --> 00:15:41,245
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

172
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:50,097
<i>My buddy and my buddy's friend</i>

173
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:55,198
<i>Can pick more cotton than the gin can gin</i>

174
00:16:00,342 --> 00:16:01,832
Come on there, mule, giddap!

175
00:16:04,913 --> 00:16:05,902
Whoa, there.

176
00:16:07,483 --> 00:16:10,418
Come on here, Spunk. Let's hurry up
and get this cotton ginned...

177
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:13,455
so we can get on downtown
there before everything's closed up.

178
00:16:13,522 --> 00:16:15,581
It'll be over in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

179
00:16:15,658 --> 00:16:17,751
Well, if you'd just shake
your tail a little bit...

180
00:16:17,826 --> 00:16:20,386
- it'd be so much better.
- Come on and help me.

181
00:16:20,462 --> 00:16:23,431
- I is. I done all the work, anyhow.
- What do you know?

182
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:32,098
- Listen.
- I'm listening.

183
00:16:32,274 --> 00:16:33,502
Sure sounds pretty, don't it?

184
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,042
Sure is.

185
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,609
You know that song.

186
00:16:37,012 --> 00:16:40,573
- But I ain't sung that in a long time.
- Sounds like <i>At the End of the Road.</i>

187
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:53,127
<i>The way is long</i>

188
00:16:53,195 --> 00:16:55,288
<i>The night is dark</i>

189
00:16:55,364 --> 00:16:58,856
<i>But I don't mind 'cause a happy lark</i>

190
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,926
<i>Will be singing</i>

191
00:17:02,004 --> 00:17:05,531
<i>At the end of the road</i>

192
00:17:07,376 --> 00:17:11,437
<i>I can't go wrong, I must go right</i>

193
00:17:11,513 --> 00:17:15,415
<i>I'll find my way 'cause the guiding light</i>

194
00:17:15,484 --> 00:17:18,180
<i>Will be shining</i>

195
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:22,155
<i>At the end of the road</i>

196
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:27,351
<i>There may be thorns in my path</i>

197
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:30,728
<i>But I'll wear a smile</i>

198
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,895
<i>'Cause in a little while</i>

199
00:17:35,003 --> 00:17:39,497
<i>My path will be roses</i>

200
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:44,605
<i>The rain may fall from up above</i>

201
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,138
<i>But I won't stop 'cause the ones I love</i>

202
00:17:48,217 --> 00:17:51,152
<i>Will be waiting</i>

203
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,417
<i>At the end of the road</i>

204
00:17:56,959 --> 00:18:00,952
<i>The way is long, the night is dark</i>

205
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:04,521
<i>But I don't mind 'cause a happy lark</i>

206
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,830
<i>Will be singing</i>

207
00:18:06,902 --> 00:18:10,269
<i>At the end of the road</i>

208
00:18:12,941 --> 00:18:16,809
<i>I can't go wrong, I must go right</i>

209
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:20,406
<i>I'll find my way 'cause a guiding light</i>

210
00:18:20,482 --> 00:18:23,349
<i>Will be shining</i>

211
00:18:23,418 --> 00:18:27,286
<i>At the end of the road</i>

212
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:31,816
<i>I seem to roam through a field</i>

213
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,223
<i>That is snowy white</i>

214
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:38,731
<i>And through the silent night</i>

215
00:18:39,134 --> 00:18:43,127
<i>A banjo is strumming</i>

216
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:48,476
<i>It says, "Come back, I roam no more"</i>

217
00:18:48,644 --> 00:18:52,045
<i>My mammy's heart and the cabin door</i>

218
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:55,049
<i>Will be open</i>

219
00:18:55,117 --> 00:18:58,109
<i>At the end of the road</i>

220
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:05,284
- We sure needs you around here, Zeke.
- Hello there, fellas. How is everything?

221
00:19:06,495 --> 00:19:08,895
You sure can sing good, fellas.

222
00:19:08,964 --> 00:19:10,898
I feel much better. I can work harder.
Can't you?

223
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:14,402
Yes, indeed. I'm going to get
this cotton on down in this gin here.

224
00:19:14,469 --> 00:19:15,697
Come on here, boy. Let's get through.

225
00:19:21,643 --> 00:19:23,270
Yes. Here I is, fellas.

226
00:19:23,345 --> 00:19:25,506
Let her come on down here.

227
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,387
Take it on down here.

228
00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:36,650
- Look out, down there.
- There.

229
00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:39,193
<i>Going down to New Orleans</i>

230
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:43,925
<i>- Going to leave my honey downriver</i>
<i>- Roll down from night till day</i>

231
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:48,834
<i>- Well, I'm sure going away forever</i>
<i>- Going down to New Orleans</i>

232
00:19:48,904 --> 00:19:53,739
<i>- Going to leave my honey downriver</i>
<i>- Roll down from night till day</i>

233
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:56,743
<i>Roll the cotton, roll the cotton</i>

234
00:19:56,845 --> 00:19:59,336
<i>Roll the cotton from early morn</i>

235
00:19:59,414 --> 00:20:02,042
<i>Roll the cotton, roll the cotton</i>

236
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,108
<i>Roll this baby sure as you're born</i>

237
00:20:04,186 --> 00:20:06,848
<i>Roll the cotton, roll the cotton</i>

238
00:20:06,922 --> 00:20:09,288
<i>Roll the cotton from early morn</i>

239
00:20:09,358 --> 00:20:14,057
<i>Roll the cotton, roll the cotton</i>
<i>Roll this baby sure as you're born</i>

240
00:20:16,098 --> 00:20:18,623
I sure is going to eat myself...

241
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,430
plenty of corn bread
and chitlins here tonight.

242
00:20:38,253 --> 00:20:40,221
Do it, Cy. Do it for your papa.

243
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,916
What did he get?

244
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:54,532
- Lord save us, look at that gal.
- Did you see those eyes?

245
00:20:55,437 --> 00:20:56,870
Yes, sir!

246
00:20:56,939 --> 00:20:58,167
Some chicken.

247
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,868
What a brown-skinned
bunch of sweetness she is.

248
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:04,077
Three steps to Heaven.
Angels walking on earth.

249
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:09,110
Boy, she's chocolate to the bone.

250
00:21:12,321 --> 00:21:14,812
Boy, shake that starboard hip.

251
00:21:15,624 --> 00:21:17,455
Open that door and let me in here.

252
00:21:17,592 --> 00:21:19,423
Boy, she knows her stuff.

253
00:21:20,462 --> 00:21:23,192
That baby's got a wiggle
even worms can't realize.

254
00:21:23,665 --> 00:21:27,066
- No fooling, that gal sure knows her...
- Get back here, boy.

255
00:21:27,135 --> 00:21:29,000
- Oh, Lord.
- Here, here, here.

256
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,302
You is just what I has got on my mind.

257
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,940
Let's get on away from here.

258
00:21:34,009 --> 00:21:36,273
Say, get out of the way, small change.

259
00:21:36,578 --> 00:21:38,978
You don't look like no big money to me.

260
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:46,117
I don't, doesn't I?

261
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:50,116
Well, just let your eyes feast upon this.

262
00:21:52,494 --> 00:21:55,486
Guy got a roll that would choke
an elephant.

263
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,862
No, no, it ain't nothing like that.

264
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,769
This here money is mine,
and here it is where it remains.

265
00:22:03,705 --> 00:22:06,230
Say, where did you get all the money,
big boy?

266
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:09,070
<i>Cotton, cotton</i>

267
00:22:09,144 --> 00:22:11,476
<i>Always picking cotton</i>

268
00:22:12,681 --> 00:22:16,082
Don't matter where I gets my money,
I has it just the same.

269
00:22:17,152 --> 00:22:18,585
Where is you going, honey?

270
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,551
Anywhere you going, big boy.

271
00:22:20,689 --> 00:22:21,713
Sure enough?

272
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,758
- Well, let's go away from here.
- I want to look good...

273
00:22:23,825 --> 00:22:25,315
Come on away from here, honey.

274
00:23:33,228 --> 00:23:35,196
Hello there, gal, how you feeling?

275
00:23:35,864 --> 00:23:37,491
Got any money?

276
00:24:07,295 --> 00:24:09,024
Let's have it, tin can.

277
00:24:09,931 --> 00:24:12,456
- That's it, girl.
- Get out there, will you, honey.

278
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:17,066
<i>The Benevolent Orders</i>
<i>of the Flat-Footed Waiters</i>

279
00:24:17,172 --> 00:24:19,106
<i>Gave their annual ball</i>

280
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:22,537
<i>With the price of admission</i>
<i>only one half-a-dollar</i>

281
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:24,738
<i>They just crowded the hall</i>

282
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,808
<i>Flat-footing around</i>

283
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,874
<i>They suddenly found</i>

284
00:24:29,951 --> 00:24:33,079
<i>An original movement</i>
<i>that they call the Swanee Shuffle</i>

285
00:24:33,155 --> 00:24:35,316
<i>It's for you and for all</i>

286
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,416
<i>Now learn to do the Swanee Shuffle</i>

287
00:24:38,627 --> 00:24:40,993
<i>Nothing to the Swanee Shuffle</i>

<i>Swanee Shuffle along</i>

290
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,802
<i>If they're flat just make them flatter</i>

291
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,334

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,836
There it is now. There it is now.

316
00:26:36,544 --> 00:26:39,206
Oh, shuffle it, boy. Move it, baby.

317
00:26:39,547 --> 00:26:41,640
Now that boy's sweet as honey.

318
00:26:41,716 --> 00:26:43,377
All right, nice.

319
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,581
Everybody dance!

320
00:28:30,258 --> 00:28:31,919
Oh, play that thing.

321
00:28:54,949 --> 00:28:56,576
How you feel, big boy?

322
00:28:56,684 --> 00:28:58,311
Like my dancing?

323
00:28:58,787 --> 00:28:59,811
Does I?

324
00:29:00,255 --> 00:29:03,190
Honey, I likes anything you's got.

325
00:29:04,092 --> 00:29:06,822
My great, big, dancing,
teasing, trancing man.

326
00:29:14,636 --> 00:29:16,570
How much money is you got, big boy?

327
00:29:17,405 --> 00:29:21,671
Well, I's got to close on 'round...
About $100.

328
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:24,709
You ain't got $200, is you, honey?

329
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:29,209
No, I ain't got no $200.

330
00:29:29,417 --> 00:29:32,352
$100 suits me all right, right now.

331
00:29:33,888 --> 00:29:36,982
But wouldn't it be nice if you had $200...

332
00:29:37,058 --> 00:29:39,618
so you and me could spend $100...

333
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:42,686
and then you could take that other $100
home where it belongs?

334
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:46,299
Well, where's I gonna get any $200?

335
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:50,861
Why, it took my family six months'
hard work to get half that much.

336
00:29:50,939 --> 00:29:55,137
But with financing,
there ain't nothing you can't get.

337
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,610
Why, honey, a boy came here last week...

338
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,647
with only $10 to his name...

339
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,147
and when he walked out...

340
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,674
he had close around to
$300 in his hind pocket...

341
00:30:04,752 --> 00:30:07,312
and Hot Shot's favorite diamond ring.

342
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,413
Where did he get all that luck from?

343
00:30:09,491 --> 00:30:12,722
- Just dancing with you, honey?
- Now who's been talking to you?

344
00:30:12,794 --> 00:30:15,194
I's just overflowing with luck.

345
00:30:15,363 --> 00:30:18,799
Dancing with me is like having
a rabbit foot in each pocket.

346
00:30:19,501 --> 00:30:24,461
Then I ought to be about the luckiest man
in the world, right now.

347
00:30:26,274 --> 00:30:28,868
I ought to have been here a long time ago.

348
00:30:33,448 --> 00:30:35,916
Why, what do you know about that?

349
00:30:35,984 --> 00:30:39,044
- Why, if that ain't the old boy himself.
- Where?

350
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,688
Well, there's Hot Shot now, honey.

351
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:45,487
Say listen, he's got more money
than he knows what to do with.

352
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,155
And is one of the most generous suckers
I ever heard tell of.

353
00:30:49,297 --> 00:30:52,494
- Is that true, sure enough?
- I mean it.

354
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:05,570
Let's go on to him and ask. Right now.

355
00:31:05,647 --> 00:31:08,047
Come on, let's go see what he got.

356
00:31:08,216 --> 00:31:09,683
Come on, big boy.

357
00:31:10,151 --> 00:31:11,516
Atta boy.

358
00:31:13,488 --> 00:31:15,353
Hey, Hot Shot, look here.

359
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:19,493
Who called Hot Shot?

360
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:21,987
Come here a minute, will you?

361
00:31:25,033 --> 00:31:29,094
What's on your mind, high yellow?
What's aching you now?

362
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:31,434
Here's a boy who says he feels
kind of lucky.

363
00:31:31,606 --> 00:31:34,666
And he wants to know if you gonna
give him a little accommodation.

364
00:31:35,076 --> 00:31:37,442
Say, come on now
and help the boy out a little.

365
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,713
You know anything
about shooting dice, son?

366
00:31:40,782 --> 00:31:44,149
Well, I just knows the words.
I ain't so familiar with the tune.

367
00:31:44,452 --> 00:31:46,044
You old sweet rascal, you.

368
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:49,214
- You sure can say some cute things.
- Sure enough?

369
00:31:50,525 --> 00:31:51,924
Not tonight.

370
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,825
I ain't wasting no time
on no buck-and-a-half cotton picker.

371
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,429
Say, what's the matter with you,
goofy head.

372
00:31:59,734 --> 00:32:03,397
This boy ain't one of those kind,
is you, big boy?

373
00:32:05,139 --> 00:32:07,869
Say, what does he mean,
buck-and-a-half cotton picker?

374
00:32:07,942 --> 00:32:10,433
I bet I got more money in my pocket
right now...

375
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,911
- than he ever thought of having.
- Sure you have.

376
00:32:12,981 --> 00:32:16,473
Say, honey, wouldn't it be nice
if you'd spent a $100...

377
00:32:16,751 --> 00:32:19,447
all on your baby? By this time tomorrow...

378
00:32:19,554 --> 00:32:21,647
Yeah, what is the matter
with that tinhorn?

379
00:32:21,723 --> 00:32:23,987
Come on over here,
let me show him something.

380
00:32:24,392 --> 00:32:26,758
What do you mean,
"buck-and-a-half cotton picker"?

381
00:32:26,828 --> 00:32:29,388
Suppose I paid you $20 right off the bat?

382
00:32:29,497 --> 00:32:31,328
That makes a lot of difference.

383
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:33,128
Money talks with me brother,
money talks.

384
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,169
That's just what I said, money talks.

385
00:32:35,236 --> 00:32:37,761
Go ahead, he wins the first throw.

386
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:38,828
Deuce...

387
00:32:40,274 --> 00:32:42,401
- and a six.
- Atta, baby!

388
00:32:43,578 --> 00:32:45,239
Stand close to me, honey.

389
00:32:45,346 --> 00:32:47,473
Keep on feeding me luck, yeah?

390
00:32:48,116 --> 00:32:49,105
Oh, boy.

391
00:32:49,183 --> 00:32:51,242
Let's hit old stiff hat
for a natural right now.

392
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:52,980
That'll be good.

393
00:32:54,756 --> 00:32:55,780
Oh, boy.

394
00:32:55,857 --> 00:32:58,849
Eleven. How do you like that?

395
00:32:58,926 --> 00:33:00,917
Just fine.

396
00:33:44,972 --> 00:33:46,963
Well, I'll give you a break, big boy.

397
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:48,508
Go ahead, shoot that 40.

398
00:33:49,544 --> 00:33:51,876
Go ahead and shoot the 40.
You... He can't win no more.

399
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,141
Come on, now, money can't
grow down there in the hand.

400
00:33:54,215 --> 00:33:56,080
Put it down. Atta boy!

401
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,414
Don't fail me this time, dice.

402
00:33:59,053 --> 00:34:03,854
- Roll right out on a natural.
- Here it is again.

403
00:34:04,325 --> 00:34:05,451
Sure is.

404
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,052
Now you knows I can't keep this up
all night long, brother.

405
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,188
You sure can't.

406
00:34:10,264 --> 00:34:12,528
Bound to crap out some of these times.

407
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,367
Shoot that $80.

408
00:34:14,502 --> 00:34:18,233
Let the $80 ride. Come on.
If you win, you'll have a $160.

409
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,796
And we'll be sitting pretty.

410
00:34:19,874 --> 00:34:20,932
She's telling you right, boy.

411
00:34:21,008 --> 00:34:23,636
- Come on, put your money out there.
- Let's go. Can't wait all night.

412
00:34:23,711 --> 00:34:25,235
Well, this is the time we hit him.

413
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,440
Honey, stick close to me now,
sure enough.

414
00:34:27,515 --> 00:34:29,642
Yeah, and this is the time
that old boy craps.

415
00:34:29,717 --> 00:34:31,378
Let it be snake eyes.

416
00:34:31,452 --> 00:34:34,888
Let me be right, dice, let me be right.

417
00:34:35,089 --> 00:34:36,556
Keep the big boy broke.

418
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:42,695
This is my last chance.
Natural, dice, natural.

419
00:34:42,764 --> 00:34:44,231
Right in the dough.

420
00:34:44,432 --> 00:34:45,797
In the dough is right.

421
00:34:45,867 --> 00:34:47,801
That is a six and an ace.

422
00:34:51,105 --> 00:34:54,506
This is the best gravy train ever rolled
up my alley.

423
00:34:54,942 --> 00:34:57,137
That didn't take long.

424
00:34:58,379 --> 00:34:59,903
Pretty good day.

425
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,876
He's took all my money.

426
00:35:01,949 --> 00:35:04,474
I didn't know. I thought you'd win.

427
00:35:04,819 --> 00:35:06,912
Oh, I'll help you to get some more money.

428
00:35:07,054 --> 00:35:08,646
Oh, don't act like this.

429
00:35:10,758 --> 00:35:11,782
Oh, my goodness.

430
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,156
Let me see them dice.

431
00:35:13,227 --> 00:35:15,457
You ain't suspecting me, is you, big boy.

432
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,862
There ain't nothing wrong with them dice.

433
00:35:17,932 --> 00:35:19,092
Go on, let him see the dice, Hot Shot.

434
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:21,635
Well, I ain't saying nothing,
but let me see them dice.

435
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,602
Come on, why don't you let him see them?

436
00:35:24,772 --> 00:35:26,239
That ain't nothing.

437
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,936
There they is.
There ain't nothing wrong with them dice.

438
00:35:31,012 --> 00:35:33,446
There ain't nothing wrong
with the dice, big boy.

439
00:35:33,681 --> 00:35:35,080
I don't see nothing wrong.

440
00:35:35,149 --> 00:35:37,913
Let me see that pair of dice
you just playing with.

441
00:35:38,319 --> 00:35:40,879
Oh, you're starting that bellyaching, huh?

442
00:35:41,322 --> 00:35:42,516
Starting that racket.

443
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:45,753
Come on, let him see the dice,
if you got any more in your pocket.

444
00:35:45,827 --> 00:35:48,261
Let me see that pair of dice you got
in your pocket.

445
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:51,057
Say, you better keep quiet.

446
00:35:51,632 --> 00:35:53,065
You big country hick.

447
00:35:53,134 --> 00:35:56,126
Say, don't call him no country hick.
He ain't no country hick.

448
00:35:56,204 --> 00:35:58,604
You'll be getting my back up in a minute.

449
00:35:59,373 --> 00:36:01,102
Why don't you stop all this?

450
00:36:01,342 --> 00:36:05,438
Going around here squawking about
losing your dough like a big 10-year-old.

451
00:36:06,848 --> 00:36:08,839
Oh, my goodness.

452
00:36:13,888 --> 00:36:16,083
Say, don't take it so hard, big boy.

453
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:19,258
There's lots more cotton in the field.

454
00:36:19,794 --> 00:36:20,726
Let me alone.

455
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:22,890
I'm asking you once more.

456
00:36:22,964 --> 00:36:24,693
Let me see them dice you got
in your pocket.

457
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:27,563
Now, I'm getting pretty tired of you
trying to bullyrag me.

458
00:36:27,668 --> 00:36:30,262
Now you get your hide out of here
before I throws it out.

459
00:36:30,338 --> 00:36:33,899
Go on out, big boy.
I'll be out in a minute. Go on.

460
00:36:40,381 --> 00:36:43,714
Now, you clear out of here
before I let you have some of this.

461
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:45,012
Give 'em room, give 'em room.

462
00:36:45,086 --> 00:36:46,713
Come on, get a move on.

463
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,721
Zeke.

464
00:36:49,223 --> 00:36:50,713
There's the door.

465
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,732
Come back here and give me
my money back, you dirty thieves.

466
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,573
You dirty skunks.

467
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:51,743
Spunk.

468
00:37:51,819 --> 00:37:53,218
Where did you come from?

469
00:37:53,287 --> 00:37:54,652
How did you find me?

470
00:37:54,722 --> 00:37:56,087
I heard your voice.

471
00:37:58,392 --> 00:38:00,223
You ain't hurt, is you?

472
00:38:00,294 --> 00:38:01,283
I'm hurt, right here.

473
00:38:03,064 --> 00:38:04,759
You're all right, ain't you?

474
00:38:04,999 --> 00:38:06,694
Speak to me, Spunk.

475
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:07,756
Oh, God!

476
00:38:08,502 --> 00:38:10,732
- Where is you hurt, Spunk?
- Right here...

477
00:38:15,176 --> 00:38:18,407
Zeke, did they get the money from
the cotton seed?

478
00:38:20,081 --> 00:38:22,879
I'm so glad I found you, big brother.

479
00:38:24,418 --> 00:38:25,407
Can't you...

480
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:28,286
Can't you do something for me?

481
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,189
Hold me.

482
00:38:31,425 --> 00:38:32,722
These bullets...

483
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,026
These bullets hurt me so.

484
00:38:37,932 --> 00:38:39,661
- Wait a minute...
- Oh, Lord, help me.

485
00:38:40,434 --> 00:38:43,164
...and I'll see if I can get
somebody to help me.

486
00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:51,077
Oh, help me, somebody.

487
00:38:51,145 --> 00:38:53,773
Come here and help me.
My brother is dying.

488
00:38:53,848 --> 00:38:57,045
Oh, God, won't somebody help me?

489
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:02,189
Help me, please. Help me, please.

490
00:39:06,193 --> 00:39:07,490
Spunk.

491
00:39:13,134 --> 00:39:15,466
I'll take you home to Mammy.

492
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,670
She'll help me.

493
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,800
Can you stand up, Spunk?

494
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,309
Can you try to help and get up?

495
00:39:48,669 --> 00:39:51,433
Come on. Come across you.
You're holding out on me, eh?

496
00:39:52,273 --> 00:39:54,434
You keep quiet.
You only get half of what I won.

497
00:39:54,508 --> 00:39:56,339
Didn't I have $40 when I started?

498
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:58,742
Oh, you ain't never had $40 in your life.

499
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:16,661
Oh, Lord...

500
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:21,565
have mercy on my children.

501
00:40:21,635 --> 00:40:26,572
Have mercy on my soul.

502
00:40:32,813 --> 00:40:36,305
- Haven't they been here, Mammy?
- Mammy, didn't the boys...

503
00:40:36,383 --> 00:40:37,850
Didn't the boys come home yet?

504
00:40:37,952 --> 00:40:39,817
Mama, what's the matter?

505
00:40:42,256 --> 00:40:44,816
Children ain't come home yet.

506
00:40:54,268 --> 00:40:57,931
Have mercy upon my children.

507
00:40:58,405 --> 00:40:59,838
Mammy, don't cry.

508
00:40:59,907 --> 00:41:01,670
Have mercy on my soul.

509
00:41:01,742 --> 00:41:03,607
Don't cry, Mammy, they coming home.

510
00:41:03,677 --> 00:41:06,441
Oh, Lord!

511
00:41:08,449 --> 00:41:11,111
Mammy, don't cry.

512
00:41:14,655 --> 00:41:16,350
The Lord will bring them home safe.

513
00:41:16,457 --> 00:41:18,584
The Lord will bring them home, Mammy.
Don't worry.

514
00:41:18,659 --> 00:41:20,854
- Oh, our poor boys.
- Don't cry, Mammy.

515
00:41:22,663 --> 00:41:24,893
We wonder this morning where they are.

516
00:41:26,867 --> 00:41:28,960
Send them to us, sweet Jesus.

517
00:41:29,036 --> 00:41:31,197
Yes, Lord. Lord have mercy upon them.

518
00:41:31,272 --> 00:41:33,570
Let our boys come. Where can they be?

519
00:41:33,641 --> 00:41:35,302
Yes, Lord.

520
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,001
Have mercy upon our brothers.

521
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:40,240
Where can our boys be this morning?

522
00:41:40,514 --> 00:41:41,811
Lord, have mercy upon them.

523
00:41:41,882 --> 00:41:43,645
Can they be on their way here?

524
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,510
What's that I hear?

525
00:41:52,126 --> 00:41:53,252
Zeke.

526
00:41:54,562 --> 00:41:55,756
Oh, my God.

527
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,591
Where is our boy Spunk?

528
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,291
Where is Spunk?

529
00:42:17,918 --> 00:42:21,319
Oh, our poor boy.

530
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:29,028
Oh, Lord, have mercy upon us. Oh, Lord.

531
00:42:30,331 --> 00:42:33,459
Lord, have mercy upon us this morning.

532
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,535
Lord, have mercy...

533
00:42:39,006 --> 00:42:42,874
<i>Oh, graveyard</i>

534
00:42:43,043 --> 00:42:48,504
<i>Oh, graveyard</i>

535
00:42:50,517 --> 00:42:56,922
<i>Oh, graveyard</i>

536
00:42:57,057 --> 00:43:04,259
<i>You must give us his body now</i>

537
00:43:24,618 --> 00:43:27,485
<i>Weep not</i>

538
00:43:29,556 --> 00:43:36,018
<i>Weep not, dear Mother</i>

539
00:43:36,664 --> 00:43:43,035
<i>The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away</i>

540
00:43:45,306 --> 00:43:47,900
<i>Weep not, Father</i>

541
00:44:10,364 --> 00:44:11,729
Come, son.

542
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,764
I am not here to judge you.

543
00:44:19,506 --> 00:44:22,441
Oh, Pappy, I've sinned.

544
00:44:22,643 --> 00:44:23,871
I've sinned...

545
00:44:24,645 --> 00:44:26,977
and I am hanging on the edge of hell.

546
00:44:28,015 --> 00:44:29,175
Yes, son.

547
00:44:29,316 --> 00:44:31,307
But the Lord forgives.

548
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,454
My heart is aching for my poor brother.

549
00:44:36,557 --> 00:44:38,787
Oh, my heart is aching.

550
00:44:51,472 --> 00:44:55,033
Oh, Pappy, show me how to repent.

551
00:44:55,876 --> 00:44:57,503
Show me the way.

552
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:00,936
Look, son...

553
00:45:02,049 --> 00:45:05,507
the Lord has sent an angel...

554
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:07,886
to show you the way.

555
00:45:12,092 --> 00:45:14,720
Can't you see him coming...

556
00:45:15,696 --> 00:45:18,460
in that snow-white chariot...

557
00:45:20,768 --> 00:45:22,998
and snow-white robe?

558
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,440
Can't you hear him, son?

559
00:45:31,111 --> 00:45:33,807
It is the angel of the Lord...

560
00:45:35,048 --> 00:45:36,811
that comforts...

561
00:45:37,284 --> 00:45:38,979
them that mourn.

562
00:45:44,258 --> 00:45:45,657
Look, son...

563
00:45:46,293 --> 00:45:47,851
can't you see him?

564
00:45:55,969 --> 00:45:57,493
Yes, Pappy.

565
00:45:57,604 --> 00:45:59,697
I see him and I hear him.

566
00:46:00,974 --> 00:46:03,636
The Lord's done showed me the light.

567
00:46:04,545 --> 00:46:08,675
The Lord has done revealed
the truth of his creation.

568
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:11,813
I lay my brother...

569
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:14,053
down in the ground...

570
00:46:14,121 --> 00:46:16,453
but the ground can't hold my brother.

571
00:46:16,924 --> 00:46:18,186
No, Pappy.

572
00:46:18,425 --> 00:46:20,552
The ground can't hold him.

573
00:46:20,994 --> 00:46:24,896
'Cause the Lord is stronger
than the ground.

574
00:46:24,965 --> 00:46:25,954
Yes.

575
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,495
Why, the Lord is the ground.

576
00:46:28,936 --> 00:46:31,530
The Lord is the sky...

577
00:46:32,105 --> 00:46:36,007
and the heavens
and the moon and the sun.

578
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:39,174
The Lord is the earth...

579
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:43,045
and all the living things of the earth.

580
00:46:43,116 --> 00:46:44,105
Yes.

581
00:46:44,918 --> 00:46:47,113
The Lord in his kingdom.

582
00:46:47,621 --> 00:46:49,885
Ain't no more pain.

583
00:46:50,958 --> 00:46:53,153
There ain't no more sorrow.

584
00:46:53,994 --> 00:46:56,588
And there ain't no more death.

585
00:46:56,964 --> 00:46:59,194
So why do we wail in grief?

586
00:47:01,835 --> 00:47:05,430
Oh, my brother...

587
00:47:06,273 --> 00:47:09,765
I gives you back to the sky and the wind...

588
00:47:11,378 --> 00:47:14,541
and to the earth and to the seas.

589
00:47:15,716 --> 00:47:18,685
Oh, my brother...

590
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,450
I gives you back to the Lord.

591
00:47:24,157 --> 00:47:27,058
For the Lord is the beginning...

592
00:47:27,127 --> 00:47:29,152
as well as the end.

593
00:47:31,031 --> 00:47:34,000
Come with your sorrow...

594
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:37,832
and leave with his joy.

595
00:47:39,072 --> 00:47:44,009
Come with your failure...

596
00:47:44,578 --> 00:47:47,604
and leave with his victory.

597
00:47:48,749 --> 00:47:53,550
Come, oh come with your emptiness...

598
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:57,954
and leave with the fullness of his joy.

599
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:01,526
Come, oh, come to the Lord.

600
00:48:04,731 --> 00:48:09,691
Come to that land of green pastures.

601
00:48:14,508 --> 00:48:16,703
Come to the Lord.

602
00:48:16,777 --> 00:48:19,610
Amen.

603
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:30,286
Hallelujah!

604
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,524
Out in the night.

605
00:48:36,563 --> 00:48:43,025
<i>Swing low, sweet chariot</i>

606
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:49,105
<i>Coming for to carry me home</i>

607
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:55,839
<i>Swing low, sweet chariot</i>

608
00:48:56,183 --> 00:49:02,213
<i>Coming for to carry me home</i>

609
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:08,483
<i>I looked over Jordan and what did I see</i>

610
00:49:08,629 --> 00:49:13,396
<i>Coming for to carry me home</i>

611
00:49:13,467 --> 00:49:20,737
<i>A band of angels coming after me</i>

612
00:49:20,807 --> 00:49:24,334
<i>Coming for to carry me home</i>

613
00:49:24,411 --> 00:49:25,002
Amen.

614
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:35,651
<i>Get on board, little children</i>

615
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:38,745
<i>Get on board, little children</i>

616
00:49:38,856 --> 00:49:41,154
<i>Get on board, little children</i>

617
00:49:41,225 --> 00:49:43,489
<i>There's room for many a-more</i>

618
00:49:44,295 --> 00:49:45,922
Brethren and sisters...

619
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:49,631
the servant of the Lord is here,
to give you all...

620
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:53,192
a free airplane ride direct to glory.
Let's go!

621
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:55,335
Amen.

622
00:49:55,439 --> 00:49:58,169
Amen. All right, you fellas.

623
00:49:59,777 --> 00:50:01,904
- Give me a dunking down.
- Get on behind him.

624
00:50:01,979 --> 00:50:04,379
- All right, just lead him. I'll kick him out.
- Get down!

625
00:50:10,621 --> 00:50:12,851
I'm glad to shake your hand.

626
00:50:17,628 --> 00:50:21,621
Thank you, sir. Yes, sir.
Come down to the meeting tonight.

627
00:50:21,932 --> 00:50:23,957
Thank you, brother!

628
00:50:28,606 --> 00:50:29,800
Giddap!

629
00:50:34,211 --> 00:50:36,509
I've had me a good time today, really!

630
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:38,605
Hot mama, raring to go.
Where you going, buttercup?

631
00:50:38,682 --> 00:50:40,650
I is going where I's going,
that's where I's going!

632
00:50:40,718 --> 00:50:42,379
You move out the way.

633
00:50:42,453 --> 00:50:44,421
Everywhere I go,
you come following along behind me.

634
00:50:44,488 --> 00:50:46,956
- Oh, now...
- Oh, move out the way! Get out!

635
00:50:50,628 --> 00:50:53,358
Hallelujah! Brother Zekiel's coming!
Hallelujah!

636
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:55,398
Hallelujah! Brother Zekiel's coming!
Hallelujah!

637
00:50:57,534 --> 00:51:02,972
<i>Great day, the righteous marching</i>
<i>Great day</i>

638
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:08,535
<i>God's going to build up Zion's walls</i>
<i>Great day</i>

639
00:51:09,013 --> 00:51:13,677
<i>Great day, the righteous marching</i>
<i>Great day</i>

640
00:51:14,418 --> 00:51:17,353
<i>God's going to build up Zion's walls</i>

641
00:51:17,421 --> 00:51:19,912
<i>This is the day of jubilee</i>

642
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:22,959
<i>God's going to build up Zion's walls</i>

643
00:51:23,027 --> 00:51:24,153
<i>God's going to set his...</i>

644
00:51:24,228 --> 00:51:25,593
Be still!

645
00:51:27,965 --> 00:51:31,662
Look at that little mule!
What kind of mule is that?

646
00:51:35,472 --> 00:51:36,905
Hey, Chick...

647
00:51:36,974 --> 00:51:40,000
ain't that, that guy
we cleaned out down in Greenville?

648
00:51:40,144 --> 00:51:43,671
What you know about that? It sure am.

649
00:51:44,248 --> 00:51:47,809
Well, well, well!
So that's who this guy is, eh?

650
00:51:48,352 --> 00:51:51,583
That's that guy. Can you beat that!

651
00:51:55,426 --> 00:51:58,657
Hey, let's have some fun
with this guy here. Come on.

652
00:52:00,097 --> 00:52:03,362
Hey there, Brother!
How's the dice rolling these days?

653
00:52:05,336 --> 00:52:09,670
A big fella like you ought to be carrying
that little donkey instead of riding it!

654
00:52:10,374 --> 00:52:13,070
- Hey, did you get that look?
- Did I?

655
00:52:14,345 --> 00:52:17,712
You've kind of turned up your nose
at us sinners, nowadays, huh?

656
00:52:18,649 --> 00:52:23,313
Shut up, you yellow hussy.
You ain't never going to be nothing at all.

657
00:52:23,454 --> 00:52:25,922
All you want is to come here
and get after my boy!

658
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:29,016
Go on back down there
to that alley where you belong.

659
00:52:29,093 --> 00:52:32,654
Oh, well, it's just another one
of the Lord's little mistakes!

660
00:52:40,671 --> 00:52:43,572
The Lord don't make no mistakes,
you understand?

661
00:52:44,441 --> 00:52:46,409
You can make a fool of Zekiel...

662
00:52:46,477 --> 00:52:49,503
but you can't make fun of the Lord,
while Zekiel is around...

663
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:52,515
- and I'm gonna make you respect him.
- Are you gonna stand for that?

664
00:52:52,649 --> 00:52:55,482
Why don't you knock him down?

665
00:52:55,853 --> 00:52:58,378
I'll knock your brains out, you big lug.

666
00:52:59,023 --> 00:53:00,752
What you mean, anyway?

667
00:53:02,526 --> 00:53:05,051
And you can't make fun of the Lord
neither, while I'm around!

668
00:53:05,129 --> 00:53:07,393
- Let me go!
- I ain't none of them things.

669
00:53:07,464 --> 00:53:11,764
I'm the servant of the Lord, and I've got
the strength of the Lord in my arms.

670
00:53:11,835 --> 00:53:13,268
You're hurting me!

671
00:53:22,012 --> 00:53:23,912
In these two arms!

672
00:53:27,017 --> 00:53:31,681
It's too bad that he's got to put
his holy hands on you. You'll spoil them!

673
00:53:31,889 --> 00:53:32,981
Amen!

674
00:53:33,223 --> 00:53:35,657
The Lord will surely punish them for that.

675
00:53:35,726 --> 00:53:38,957
I wish I was about 10 years older.
I'd show you something!

676
00:53:42,399 --> 00:53:43,957
You got some nerve, coming down here!

677
00:53:44,034 --> 00:53:48,403
<i>Great day, the righteous marching</i>
<i>Great day</i>

678

679
00:53:52,676 --> 00:53:56,578

682
00:54:05,089 --> 00:54:08,547
<i>It was good for the Hebrew children</i>

683
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:12,391

00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,840
<i>Give me that old-time religion</i>

688
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:30,846
<i>Give me that old-time religion</i>

689
00:54:30,914 --> 00:54:34,406
<i>And it's good enough for me</i>

690
00:54:37,154 --> 00:54:39,622
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

691
00:54:50,167 --> 00:54:53,830
Look at that boy sitting up there
with his whole family around him!

692
00:54:55,739 --> 00:54:59,436
I bet you ten-to-one
you can't save me, Brother Zekiel.

693
00:55:03,614 --> 00:55:06,981
Make me cry. You're making
everybody else cry around here!

694
00:55:10,287 --> 00:55:12,221
- Say, boy, look...
- What's the matter with you, gal?

695
00:55:12,289 --> 00:55:15,554
- You crazy?
- Dry it up, small change!

696
00:55:16,727 --> 00:55:18,388
Brethren and sisters...

697
00:55:20,364 --> 00:55:22,730
the text of my sermon is going to be:

698
00:55:23,033 --> 00:55:25,763
"Repent, ye sinners...

699
00:55:27,437 --> 00:55:29,098
"before it is too late."

700
00:55:29,206 --> 00:55:31,834
- Oh yeah!
- Hallelujah!

701
00:55:33,143 --> 00:55:36,510
The road to hell is downhill.

702
00:55:36,647 --> 00:55:37,978
Downhill!

703
00:55:38,615 --> 00:55:42,449
Easy and greased like lightning.

704
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:44,846
And the Cannonball Express...

705
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:48,854
is leaving for hell twice a day.

706
00:55:48,959 --> 00:55:50,256
Yeah!

707
00:55:50,827 --> 00:55:55,526
I'm talking to all you sinners out there,
who's on that train.

708
00:55:59,603 --> 00:56:01,594
I'm going along with you...

709
00:56:02,806 --> 00:56:07,766
and I'm gonna give all you sinners
your last chance.

710
00:56:12,282 --> 00:56:13,544
But remember...

711
00:56:14,451 --> 00:56:17,943
there ain't no round trip ticket to hell!

712
00:56:22,125 --> 00:56:24,184
All aboard.

713
00:56:52,022 --> 00:56:54,183
Brothers and sisters...

714
00:56:54,558 --> 00:56:58,426
we's gonna make three stops
before we get to hell...

715
00:56:59,863 --> 00:57:02,297
and we're approaching the first one now.

716
00:57:03,267 --> 00:57:06,828
The first stop, is the town of Faith.

717
00:57:07,004 --> 00:57:08,437
Town of Faith!

718
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:13,372
It's just a little place,
but the climate is cool...

719
00:57:14,778 --> 00:57:17,303
and the people is friendly and kind.

720
00:57:19,283 --> 00:57:21,808
Some of you bootleggers...

721
00:57:22,753 --> 00:57:24,721
and some of you gamblers...

722
00:57:24,821 --> 00:57:27,654
better get off and take hold of Faith!

723
00:57:28,925 --> 00:57:31,359
Brothers, come right along!

724
00:57:31,461 --> 00:57:33,088
Preach it right and long!

725
00:57:33,163 --> 00:57:36,690
Children, come on and get off at Faith!

726
00:57:37,734 --> 00:57:39,292
That's right, children.

727
00:57:39,369 --> 00:57:42,702
Don't you make no mistake
in locating in Faith.

728
00:57:43,307 --> 00:57:45,468
We're going on to the next station.

729
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:48,805
Hear that old train pulling out?

730
00:57:49,713 --> 00:57:51,078
Pulling out!

731
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:03,255
Children, you see that old devil
throw that cinder in my eye?

732
00:58:03,327 --> 00:58:04,521
Dirty devil!

733
00:58:04,594 --> 00:58:07,427
He's just trying to make me miss
that next stop...

734
00:58:07,497 --> 00:58:09,692
but I'll surely fool him.

735
00:58:10,801 --> 00:58:12,769
I'll surely fool him.

736
00:58:13,036 --> 00:58:17,132
Get ready.
We is coming to the next station.

737
00:58:17,207 --> 00:58:18,538
- Obedience.
- Obedience!

738
00:58:18,975 --> 00:58:21,000
Oh, but Obedience.

739
00:58:21,078 --> 00:58:24,172
Here, sister. Don't leave your man behind.

740
00:58:24,915 --> 00:58:27,145
Make him get off at Obedience.

741
00:58:27,317 --> 00:58:28,443
I'll get him!

742
00:58:28,518 --> 00:58:32,215
Come on, sister. Bring your man on
and make him get off at Obedience.

743
00:58:32,289 --> 00:58:34,120
- That's right.
- That's right.

744
00:58:34,291 --> 00:58:35,758
- Obedience...
- Yeah.

745
00:58:35,826 --> 00:58:38,454
...is a nine o'clock town.
- Surely, it is.

746
00:58:38,962 --> 00:58:41,954
And the curfew rings every night.

747
00:58:42,032 --> 00:58:43,693
- Sure it does.
- Sure do!

748
00:58:44,201 --> 00:58:48,035
Bring up your children in obedience,
and you'll know...

749
00:58:48,238 --> 00:58:50,365
they'll grow up good Christians...

750
00:58:51,441 --> 00:58:54,171
and not just little old scalawags!

751
00:58:54,244 --> 00:58:57,941
Children should be seen and not heard.

752
00:58:58,014 --> 00:58:59,413
Amen!

753
00:59:00,851 --> 00:59:03,217
All you sinners.

754
00:59:04,855 --> 00:59:09,155
Come on and jump aboard, you sinners.

755
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:13,418
This side is for
the leading citizens in Obedience.

756
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:15,020
Get out here.

757
00:59:15,465 --> 00:59:18,093
We's going on to the last station.

758
00:59:19,202 --> 00:59:20,191
Watch it go.

759
00:59:21,138 --> 00:59:23,003
Can't get enough steam now.

760
00:59:26,076 --> 00:59:28,101
The last station.

761
00:59:38,555 --> 00:59:43,390
We's coming to that last station,
the last station:

762
00:59:43,627 --> 00:59:45,925
Repentance...

763
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:49,399
is the last station before hell.

764
00:59:49,699 --> 00:59:52,429
Anybody here want to get off
at Repentance?

765
00:59:52,502 --> 00:59:53,764
Oh, yeah!

766
00:59:54,137 --> 00:59:55,764
That's right, children.

767
00:59:56,239 --> 00:59:58,707
Come on, kneel on down.

768
00:59:59,409 --> 01:00:02,401
It gets kind of hot in Repentance
sometimes...

769
01:00:02,646 --> 01:00:04,944
but never as hot as hell.

770
01:00:05,582 --> 01:00:10,178
Won't you come, sister? Won't you come?

771
01:00:10,987 --> 01:00:14,514
I beg with you. I plead with you.

772
01:00:14,925 --> 01:00:17,689
Don't bother me. Leave me alone.

773
01:00:17,928 --> 01:00:20,897
I don't want to hear nothing
you got to say.

774
01:00:21,264 --> 01:00:25,428
Won't you come? Come on and repent...

775
01:00:25,869 --> 01:00:28,167
repent, I say.

776
01:00:28,238 --> 01:00:33,005
I'm speaking to that last sinner
and I don't want her to go to hell.

777
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:37,137
Won't you come? Won't you come?

778
01:00:42,252 --> 01:00:46,916
<i>You hear that old devil say</i>

779
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:49,818
<i>Come on down below</i>

780
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:54,055
<i>But you just let him know</i>

781
01:00:54,364 --> 01:00:58,994
<i>You're heading for Heaven</i>

782
01:00:59,236 --> 01:01:03,434
<i>Come on and climb the golden stairs</i>

783
01:01:03,673 --> 01:01:07,006
<i>And all your troubles and all your cares</i>

784
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:09,840
<i>Will be over at the end of the road</i>

785
01:01:09,913 --> 01:01:14,680
<i>At the end of the road</i>

786
01:01:14,751 --> 01:01:18,187
Won't you come, sister?
I'm pleading with you.

787
01:01:18,255 --> 01:01:22,055
I want to go, Brother Zekiel.
Don't leave me.

788
01:01:22,526 --> 01:01:25,927
I want to be saved. Oh, Lord.

789
01:01:26,363 --> 01:01:30,129
I want to be good.
I'm coming, Brother Zekiel.

790
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,395
I'm sticking with the last sinner...

791
01:01:32,669 --> 01:01:35,399
and I don't want her to go to hell!

792
01:01:35,472 --> 01:01:40,239
<i>'Cause the guiding light will be shining</i>

793
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:45,145
<i>At the end of the road</i>

794
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:51,482
Hallelujah!

795
01:01:51,588 --> 01:01:55,854
<i>Carry me to the water</i>

796
01:01:55,959 --> 01:02:00,487
<i>Oh, carry me to the water</i>

797
01:02:00,564 --> 01:02:05,092
<i>Oh, carry me to the water</i>

798
01:02:05,168 --> 01:02:08,399
<i>To be baptized</i>

799
01:02:08,471 --> 01:02:09,802
Hallelujah!

800
01:02:10,073 --> 01:02:13,941
<i>Carry me to the water</i>

801
01:02:16,246 --> 01:02:18,180
Stand right around, brother.

802
01:02:19,149 --> 01:02:21,640
Fold your arms.

803
01:02:26,089 --> 01:02:27,454
Hallelujah!

804
01:02:28,158 --> 01:02:30,058
Amen.

805
01:02:30,427 --> 01:02:33,225
Hallelujah!

806
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:48,309
Amen.

807
01:03:05,729 --> 01:03:10,393
<i>I have another building</i>
<i>Not made by hand, I know</i>

808
01:03:10,467 --> 01:03:14,927
<i>I know I have another building</i>
<i>A building not made by hand</i>

809
01:03:15,038 --> 01:03:19,372
<i>I know I have another building</i>
<i>Not made by hand, I know</i>

810
01:03:19,442 --> 01:03:23,776
<i>I know I have another building</i>
<i>A building not made by hand</i>

811
01:03:27,517 --> 01:03:31,112
Praise the Lord!
Praise the name! Hallelujah!

812
01:03:31,187 --> 01:03:33,155
Praise the Lord!

813
01:03:33,223 --> 01:03:37,182
<i>Carry me to the water</i>

814
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:42,497
<i>Carry me to the water</i>

815
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:47,463
<i>Carry me to the water</i>

816
01:03:47,871 --> 01:03:50,840
<i>To be baptized</i>

817
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:52,771
Hallelujah!

818
01:03:53,109 --> 01:03:55,907
Oh, Lord, make me good.

819
01:03:56,012 --> 01:04:00,142
Oh, Lord! Oh, Lord, make me pure.

820
01:04:03,253 --> 01:04:06,484
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!

821
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:11,888
Hallelujah!

822
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:15,192
Oh, brother!

823
01:04:19,202 --> 01:04:21,033
Praise his holy name.

824
01:04:21,171 --> 01:04:22,798
Amen.

825
01:04:23,073 --> 01:04:27,237
I've been a wicked woman.
I've been a wicked woman.

826
01:04:27,477 --> 01:04:29,945
- But I'm sanctified now.
- I know how it is.

827
01:04:30,013 --> 01:04:31,878
- Hallelujah!
- Amen.

828
01:04:31,948 --> 01:04:35,509
Hold me close to you, Brother Zekiel.
Keep me good.

829
01:04:35,585 --> 01:04:37,109
Keep me good.

830
01:04:37,187 --> 01:04:39,155
Don't let me sin no more.

831
01:04:48,064 --> 01:04:50,396
Pray, Brother Zekiel.

832
01:05:00,510 --> 01:05:02,375
You're so good.

833
01:05:20,029 --> 01:05:21,087
Zeke!

834
01:05:24,901 --> 01:05:26,425
Leave her here with me.

835
01:05:26,636 --> 01:05:28,831
You go on there back to your people.

836
01:05:36,746 --> 01:05:38,509
Oh, God!

837
01:05:42,519 --> 01:05:44,646
Have mercy on me!

838
01:05:46,656 --> 01:05:49,090
Here, what's the matter with you, gal?

839
01:05:50,026 --> 01:05:53,393
Ain't nothing. I know what it is.

840
01:05:53,496 --> 01:05:57,762
Yes, you got more religion
than what's good for you...

841
01:05:58,101 --> 01:05:59,159
you hypocrite!

842
01:06:00,336 --> 01:06:02,201
Come on up here, Christmas!

843
01:06:03,373 --> 01:06:06,536
You're slower than cold molasses
in the winter time.

844
01:06:06,776 --> 01:06:08,175
Come on up here.

845
01:06:08,478 --> 01:06:11,003
Tuck your heads there, boys. Come on.

846
01:06:15,151 --> 01:06:17,711
Even so, we've been mighty lucky.

847
01:06:17,887 --> 01:06:21,880
That's the first she-devil we run across
since we've started on this trip.

848
01:06:22,625 --> 01:06:26,561
She sure is pretty, Mammy.
I never see such big eyes in all my life.

849
01:06:26,863 --> 01:06:28,524
Oh, big eyes!

850
01:06:28,598 --> 01:06:31,260
Why, Zeke ain't had no mind
for no big eyes.

851
01:06:31,334 --> 01:06:33,962
Not since his brother died,
anything but them.

852
01:06:35,338 --> 01:06:39,206
<i>We got trouble here, trouble there</i>

853
01:06:39,642 --> 01:06:42,577
<i>I really don't believe</i>
<i>We got trouble everywhere</i>

854
01:06:42,645 --> 01:06:45,341
<i>We got trouble everywhere we go</i>

855
01:06:46,683 --> 01:06:47,877
He's coming now, Mammy.

856
01:06:47,951 --> 01:06:49,418
I'm gonna change my apron.

857
01:06:49,485 --> 01:06:50,645
<i>... trouble there</i>

858
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,314
<i>I really does believe</i>
<i>We got trouble everywhere</i>

859
01:06:53,423 --> 01:06:56,119
<i>We got trouble everywhere we go</i>

860
01:07:03,933 --> 01:07:05,298
Tired, son?

861
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:10,765
I'll let you have a nice plate
of this hot chitlins.

862
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:15,610
I sure would, Mammy.
But I likes everything you cook.

863
01:07:18,648 --> 01:07:21,344
I know you certainly is crazy
about chitlins.

864
01:07:24,354 --> 01:07:26,288
What's the matter, son?

865
01:07:27,390 --> 01:07:29,187
I was just thinking, Mammy.

866
01:07:29,325 --> 01:07:30,724
I don't know what I would do...

867
01:07:30,793 --> 01:07:33,455
if I didn't have you and Missy Rose
to look after me.

868
01:07:33,529 --> 01:07:37,090
It does take a good woman for to
keep a man out of mischief these days.

869
01:07:37,734 --> 01:07:40,225
That's right, Mammy. It sure does.

870
01:07:41,271 --> 01:07:43,398
Now, don't go fretting, son.

871
01:07:43,539 --> 01:07:46,167
Your Pappy and me
is the best friends you got.

872
01:07:46,476 --> 01:07:50,105
And we gonna look after you
just as long as we can.

873
01:07:50,446 --> 01:07:51,811
Thank you, Mammy.

874
01:07:52,382 --> 01:07:54,748
Because you're the same old Zeke to me.

875
01:07:57,453 --> 01:07:59,284
- Missy Rose!
- Ma'am?

876
01:07:59,355 --> 01:08:02,051
Come on here and look after
these vittles on the stove...

877
01:08:02,125 --> 01:08:04,719
while I get ready to go to the jubilee.

878
01:08:04,794 --> 01:08:05,783
Yes.

879
01:08:23,947 --> 01:08:27,212
Missy Rose, come over here
and sit down with me, won't you?

880
01:08:31,454 --> 01:08:33,718
Why, what's the matter, Brother Zeke?

881
01:08:34,557 --> 01:08:37,583
That's just it,
I don't know what is the matter.

882
01:08:38,194 --> 01:08:40,822
Seems like the devil's done
took ahold of me.

883
01:08:41,698 --> 01:08:44,326
What you mean? What kind of talk is that?

884
01:08:44,701 --> 01:08:47,636
A big strong man like you ain't
going to give in to that nasty devil...

885
01:08:47,704 --> 01:08:51,071
- after we done traveled this far.
- I don't want to give in...

886
01:08:51,441 --> 01:08:56,003
but he just keeps on a-clawing
and a-pulling after me all the time.

887
01:08:56,145 --> 01:08:59,876
- That's just the way he do.
- Just won't let me be.

888
01:09:01,484 --> 01:09:03,611
What's we going to do, big brother?

889
01:09:06,422 --> 01:09:08,617
I don't know what we're going to do.

890
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:17,258
- Unless...
- Unless what, Zeke?

891
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,832
Missy Rose, supposing you and me...

892
01:09:21,204 --> 01:09:23,365
Let's you and me get married,
at the next station.

893
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:25,805
That'll stop him quicker than anything.

894
01:09:28,878 --> 01:09:30,140
Brother Zeke.

895
01:09:31,314 --> 01:09:32,838
You know, I love you.

896
01:09:37,754 --> 01:09:40,222
Mammy, where is my pipe?

897
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:43,991
What you hide my pipe for, anyway?
Why can't you let things be?

898
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:46,893
I suspect it's up somewhere
where you just left it.

899
01:09:46,963 --> 01:09:49,090
Oh, here it is, you old stew pot.

900
01:09:49,332 --> 01:09:52,893
Mammy, Pappy, Missy Rose
and me's got a surprise for you.

901
01:09:53,102 --> 01:09:55,036
- Yeah?
- Yes. Ain't we, honey?

902
01:09:55,138 --> 01:09:56,400
- Yes.
- What is it?

903
01:09:56,472 --> 01:09:59,032
We is done decided to get married
at the next station.

904
01:09:59,108 --> 01:10:02,271
Oh, Lord!

905
01:10:02,345 --> 01:10:07,112
- Pappy, ain't that happy news?
- I long expected that.

906
01:10:07,183 --> 01:10:08,775
- Yes, and I'm glad.
- They had to come to it.

907
01:10:08,851 --> 01:10:10,546
Let me kiss both of you.

908
01:10:11,387 --> 01:10:14,481
God bless you all. Well, well, well.

909
01:10:14,557 --> 01:10:17,321
Children, that's just as it ought to be.

910
01:10:18,127 --> 01:10:19,424
Zeke and Missy.

911
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:21,897
Looky here, children.

912
01:10:21,964 --> 01:10:25,456
You know the Lord's going to set
his blessing on this wedding.

913
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:29,027
Well, well, well, this is justice for you.

914
01:10:29,105 --> 01:10:32,438
Pappy and I done waited
a long time for this day.

915
01:10:35,745 --> 01:10:38,714
Here, honey,
this ain't no time for no crying.

916
01:10:39,549 --> 01:10:41,847
Why, don't you know that
me and you is going to make...

917
01:10:41,918 --> 01:10:44,011
that old devil run so fast...

918
01:10:44,087 --> 01:10:46,715
that his horns and his tail's
gonna drop off?

919
01:10:48,825 --> 01:10:52,022
Don't cry no more, now.
Please don't cry, honey.

920
01:10:52,095 --> 01:10:54,495
- No, this ain't no time to cry.
- Yeah, Mammy, you talk to her.

921
01:10:54,564 --> 01:10:56,725
Yes, she ain't nothing at all but a child.

922
01:10:57,133 --> 01:11:01,069
Well, appears it's better
for you to cry first and then laugh last.

923
01:11:01,237 --> 01:11:03,171
I'm crying because I'm happy, Mammy.

924
01:11:03,239 --> 01:11:06,572
Yes, well these men, they ain't no angels.
There ain't none of them no angels.

925
01:11:06,642 --> 01:11:10,237
But I tell you, you wouldn't find
a better boy than my Zeke...

926
01:11:10,446 --> 01:11:13,574
if you was to scratch this world
with a fine tooth comb.

927
01:11:19,822 --> 01:11:23,588
<i>Give me that old-time religion</i>

928
01:11:23,926 --> 01:11:27,692
<i>Give me that old-time religion</i>

929
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:31,095
<i>Give me that old-time religion</i>

930
01:11:31,767 --> 01:11:35,259
<i>It is good enough for me</i>

931
01:11:35,805 --> 01:11:39,263
<i>It was good for the Hebrew children</i>

932
01:11:39,642 --> 01:11:43,169
<i>It was good for the Hebrew children</i>

933
01:11:43,379 --> 01:11:46,974
<i>It was good for the Hebrew children</i>

934
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:50,344
<i>And it's good enough for me</i>

935
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:51,646
Hallelujah!

936
01:11:51,754 --> 01:11:54,951
<i>Give me that old-time religion</i>

937
01:11:56,192 --> 01:11:59,457
What are you doing here, Hot Shot?
What are you doing here?

938
01:11:59,762 --> 01:12:03,459
So you're all hopped up about
that fake preacher, huh?

939
01:12:03,699 --> 01:12:07,499
Go on, Hot Shot, leave me be.
I ain't got no time for you now.

940
01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:11,601
Come on, you ain't got
no time for me now, huh?

941
01:12:11,707 --> 01:12:14,437
I been wrong all these years, understand?

942
01:12:14,844 --> 01:12:16,243
I found happiness.

943
01:12:16,946 --> 01:12:19,881
Brother Zekiel has given me strength
and shown me the way.

944
01:12:19,949 --> 01:12:24,352
Well, of all the people in this world
to fall for that kind of 'lasses.

945
01:12:24,887 --> 01:12:28,448
- Come on, babe, give me a kiss.
- Get out of my way, Hot Shot.

946
01:12:28,524 --> 01:12:30,116
I got religion now.

947
01:12:30,593 --> 01:12:34,085
Oh, I don't care nothing about
your religion. Come on.

948
01:12:35,031 --> 01:12:36,896
Take your hands off of me, Hot Shot!

949
01:12:36,966 --> 01:12:38,934
How come you don't want my hands
on you no more?

950
01:12:39,001 --> 01:12:42,095
I'll make you forget that psalm-singing,
crap-shooting faker.

951
01:12:42,171 --> 01:12:44,071
- He ain't none of them things.
- Yes, he is.

952
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:45,869
And I is late for the services...

953
01:12:45,942 --> 01:12:47,910
and you or nobody else
ain't going to keep me...

954
01:12:47,977 --> 01:12:50,002
from the protecting arms
of Brother Zekiel.

955
01:12:50,079 --> 01:12:52,775
- You ain't going out that door.
- Let me go!

956
01:12:53,149 --> 01:12:56,550
Can't you see that my blood
is washed in the spirit of the Lamb?

957
01:12:56,619 --> 01:13:00,180
I can see that your blood's
been washed in the fire of the devil.

958
01:13:00,690 --> 01:13:04,751
Can't you see that I'm through sinning,
Hot Shot? Oh, please.

959
01:13:04,827 --> 01:13:08,558
Oh, you ain't never gonna quit sinning, gal.
It's right there in your blood.

960
01:13:08,798 --> 01:13:11,392
Oh, Lord, give me strength!

961
01:13:11,567 --> 01:13:13,831
Oh, help me, Brothel Zekiel!

962
01:13:16,372 --> 01:13:18,169
I'll break your neck.

963
01:13:22,812 --> 01:13:25,645
Get off of me. I'll show you.

964
01:13:25,715 --> 01:13:27,342
Don't use that poker, gal.

965
01:13:31,654 --> 01:13:33,884
Don't come around no more.

966
01:13:34,690 --> 01:13:37,591
- Oh, my head!
- You dirty skunk!

967
01:13:37,927 --> 01:13:41,658
That's what I'm doing to anybody
that stands in my path to glory.

968
01:13:42,598 --> 01:13:43,758
Oh, my!

969
01:13:47,103 --> 01:13:49,128
Come on, old Devil.

970
01:13:49,205 --> 01:13:51,673
Put up your hands
before I bust you in the jaw.

971
01:13:51,741 --> 01:13:54,972
- Hit him, Brother Zekiel! Sock him!
- Don't be backing around in that corner...

972
01:13:55,044 --> 01:13:56,409
like you're scared of me.

973
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:57,537
I is with you, Brother Zekiel.

974
01:13:57,613 --> 01:14:00,411
This bell ain't going to ring
until you been down and out.

975
01:14:00,483 --> 01:14:02,178
Preach it, Brother Zeke.

976
01:14:03,819 --> 01:14:06,344
- You got me that time.
- We're proud of you, Brother.

977
01:14:06,422 --> 01:14:08,754
Yes, go ahead and laugh. Laugh.

978
01:14:09,525 --> 01:14:11,618
This going to be your last time...

979
01:14:11,694 --> 01:14:14,390
because you're going to
finish your laugh in hell.

980
01:14:14,463 --> 01:14:15,691
Hell, Brother Zekiel, hell!

981
01:14:15,765 --> 01:14:19,030
I'm tired of you making sinners
out of my people.

982
01:14:21,904 --> 01:14:25,305
Now, come on get up from there.
Pick up your bones...

983
01:14:25,941 --> 01:14:28,774
- because the fight ain't over yet.
- No.

984
01:14:28,844 --> 01:14:32,041
Now, brothers,
he's trying to give me a battle.

985
01:14:33,249 --> 01:14:35,877
- That's for the gamblers you done made.
- True.

986
01:14:35,985 --> 01:14:37,111
Yes, sir.

987
01:14:37,186 --> 01:14:39,620
- That's for the backbiters.
- Preach it.

988
01:14:39,789 --> 01:14:43,987
- And that's for the midnight ramblers.
- Tell it so they can hear it. Tell it, yes.

989
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:48,963
And that's for the corn-whiskey drinkers,
the jazz dancers...

990
01:14:49,465 --> 01:14:52,696
the scandal-mongers and the bootleggers.

991
01:14:53,703 --> 01:14:54,829
Look at him.

992
01:14:54,904 --> 01:14:59,170
There he is, the old devil is down and out.

993
01:14:59,909 --> 01:15:02,969
Somebody come here and get a stretcher
and take him away from here.

994
01:15:03,479 --> 01:15:07,279
Put him on that train to hell, and let him...

995
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:12,310
ride, let him ride on down by himself.

996
01:15:13,556 --> 01:15:18,516
- Oh, brothers, we done been sanctified.
- Sanctified!

997
01:15:19,295 --> 01:15:22,287
We done been purified.

998
01:15:23,132 --> 01:15:25,100
We done been saved...

999
01:15:25,167 --> 01:15:30,104
and we don't belong to him no more.
Amen.

1000
01:15:31,507 --> 01:15:33,668
<i>I belong to that band</i>

1001
01:15:33,776 --> 01:15:36,336
<i>I belong to that band</i>

1002
01:15:36,412 --> 01:15:39,313
<i>I belong to that band</i>

1003
01:15:39,382 --> 01:15:41,907
<i>Hallelujah</i>

1004
01:18:56,478 --> 01:18:58,503
This is Missy calling you!

1005
01:18:58,814 --> 01:19:01,339
Oh, Lordy! Come back!

1006
01:19:02,017 --> 01:19:05,282
Please don't leave me, Brother Zeke!

1007
01:19:05,354 --> 01:19:07,754
This is Missy calling you!

1008
01:19:08,057 --> 01:19:11,686
Oh, Zeke, where is you?

1009
01:19:12,361 --> 01:19:15,853
Please don't go. Come back! Don't leave!

1010
01:19:16,198 --> 01:19:18,098
Oh, Lordy!

1011
01:19:19,768 --> 01:19:23,363
Brother Zeke! Where are you?

1012
01:19:24,006 --> 01:19:25,769
Oh, no!

1013
01:19:55,704 --> 01:19:59,333
- Zeke's gone.
- Zeke is gone?

1014
01:21:22,891 --> 01:21:25,985
Knocking off, now.
Come on, boys, let's go.

1015
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:28,086
Come on here, Jim.

1016
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:35,828
Gee, Babe!
I sure had a hard time finding you.

1017
01:21:36,672 --> 01:21:40,438
And another thing, I ain't going
to leave you until you goes with me.

1018
01:21:41,076 --> 01:21:44,375
Give me some of that good old loving
you got there. Come on.

1019
01:21:54,323 --> 01:21:56,848
Holy mackerel!
The man is coming from the mill.

1020
01:21:56,925 --> 01:21:59,291
Give me my hat, woman. I'll see you later.

1021
01:21:59,361 --> 01:22:02,330
<i>I hate to see</i>

1022
01:22:02,664 --> 01:22:05,098
<i>That evening sun go down</i>

1023
01:22:06,969 --> 01:22:09,597
<i>I hate to see</i>

1024
01:22:09,938 --> 01:22:13,101
<i>That evening sun go down</i>

1025
01:22:14,276 --> 01:22:16,437
<i>My man's done quit me</i>

1026
01:22:17,045 --> 01:22:20,071
<i>And done left this town</i>

1027
01:22:20,249 --> 01:22:22,683
<i>Feeling tomorrow</i>

1028
01:22:22,785 --> 01:22:25,515
<i>Just like I feel today</i>

1029
01:22:26,221 --> 01:22:28,553
<i>Feeling tomorrow</i>

1030
01:22:28,624 --> 01:22:30,922
<i>Just like I feel today</i>

1031
01:22:31,693 --> 01:22:33,661
<i>I'm gonna pack my trunk</i>

1032
01:22:34,129 --> 01:22:36,825
<i>And make my getaway</i>

1033
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,394
<i>Easy rider</i>

1034
01:22:40,469 --> 01:22:43,097
<i>He done lost his rein</i>

1035
01:22:44,072 --> 01:22:45,937
<i>With gin and gambling</i>

1036
01:22:46,175 --> 01:22:48,609
<i>They're gonna hide your face</i>

1037
01:22:49,178 --> 01:22:51,408
<i>To work for that woman</i>

1038
01:22:53,081 --> 01:22:56,847
Say, what's the matter with you,
long face? Don't you like my singing?

1039
01:22:56,919 --> 01:22:59,046
What's that buggy doing out there?

1040
01:23:00,055 --> 01:23:03,047
Buggy? Why, honey, I ain't seen no buggy.

1041
01:23:03,125 --> 01:23:05,093
I don't know nothing about no buggy.

1042
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:07,424
Well, there was one out there
when I come in.

1043
01:23:07,496 --> 01:23:10,829
Oh, don't be suspicious.
Come on and show your baby.

1044
01:23:11,667 --> 01:23:15,000
My goodness,
you just as fussy as you can be.

1045
01:23:15,070 --> 01:23:17,504
Now come on out there
and show me where the buggy is.

1046
01:23:17,573 --> 01:23:19,040
Don't be like that.

1047
01:23:22,044 --> 01:23:25,480
Now see that, baby?
I told you there wasn't no buggy out there.

1048
01:23:26,849 --> 01:23:29,841
Come on and eat your dinner.
Don't be like that.

1049
01:23:29,918 --> 01:23:32,978
You know I love you.
Come on now and be good.

1050
01:23:34,089 --> 01:23:37,115
Come on now and sit down.
What's the matter, you sick?

1051
01:23:37,326 --> 01:23:39,886
- No.
- Well, what's the matter then?

1052
01:23:40,062 --> 01:23:43,998
Has the boss
been at you again today, huh?

1053
01:23:44,066 --> 01:23:47,297
No. I told you no. Don't bother me.

1054
01:23:52,507 --> 01:23:55,476
Tell me, honey, what's on your mind?

1055
01:23:57,012 --> 01:24:00,709
Here I've been waiting for you all day...

1056
01:24:00,782 --> 01:24:04,309
to come home and put
your big strong arms around me...

1057
01:24:04,386 --> 01:24:07,651
and now you treat me
just like I'm a stepchild.

1058
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:12,552
- Is you treating me right, Chick?
- Course I is.

1059
01:24:20,569 --> 01:24:24,596
Let your baby sit on your lap
and make you...

1060
01:24:25,574 --> 01:24:28,134
feel so good.

1061
01:24:40,722 --> 01:24:44,852
That's it, dreaming boy.
Rest your head on Chick.

1062
01:24:57,539 --> 01:24:59,598
I sure is tired, Chick.

1063
01:25:01,910 --> 01:25:04,105
I'm tired of thinking.

1064
01:25:04,179 --> 01:25:07,478
I know you is. Stop thinking.

1065
01:25:07,549 --> 01:25:10,609
Thinking makes you say
bad words to Chick.

1066
01:27:21,883 --> 01:27:23,783
Zeke, you asleep?

1067
01:27:26,655 --> 01:27:27,815
Zeke.

1068
01:28:20,108 --> 01:28:22,042
- Come on, Chick! He's following us.
- Oh, I can't run!

1069
01:28:22,110 --> 01:28:24,340
- Hurry up. He's got a gun!
- No, I can't run.

1070
01:28:24,412 --> 01:28:25,640
Please!

1071
01:28:54,776 --> 01:28:56,607
Hold tight, Chick.

1072
01:29:00,248 --> 01:29:01,977
Hold tight.

1073
01:29:05,654 --> 01:29:08,452
Hold tight, Chick.
Look out the wheel's going.

1074
01:29:20,735 --> 01:29:23,761
Thought you was going
to get away from me, didn't you?

1075
01:29:24,873 --> 01:29:27,364
Don't you know
you can't quit me like that?

1076
01:29:27,742 --> 01:29:30,905
Before I let you get away from me,
I'll break you in two.

1077
01:29:34,316 --> 01:29:37,080
I is broke in two already, Zeke.

1078
01:29:38,486 --> 01:29:40,977
Please take me out of this mud.

1079
01:29:42,157 --> 01:29:45,820
Don't talk to me like that. Oh, please.

1080
01:29:46,228 --> 01:29:48,822
Won't you please take me out?

1081
01:29:49,931 --> 01:29:51,762
Oh, please.

1082
01:29:51,833 --> 01:29:54,324
Don't you know
you can't quit me like that?

1083
01:30:00,075 --> 01:30:02,270
I ain't two-timing you, Zeke.

1084
01:30:02,577 --> 01:30:06,513
- That's what you been doing all the time.
- I never knowed what I wanted.

1085
01:30:07,249 --> 01:30:09,114
Don't be sore with me.

1086
01:30:11,486 --> 01:30:13,920
That old devil's coming closer now...

1087
01:30:15,156 --> 01:30:18,023
and I is getting more scared all the time.

1088
01:30:22,897 --> 01:30:25,764
That old devil's
reaching out his claws for me.

1089
01:30:27,035 --> 01:30:28,969
Can't you help your Chick now?

1090
01:30:31,306 --> 01:30:32,398
No.

1091
01:30:33,875 --> 01:30:36,241
Your Chick's done gone to the devil.

1092
01:30:36,911 --> 01:30:40,142
No, honey. You can't go! You can't go!

1093
01:30:43,918 --> 01:30:48,617
Zekiel, don't let that old devil get me.

1094
01:30:52,761 --> 01:30:57,198
Old devil can't get you, honey.
Not as long as I'm around.

1095
01:30:57,999 --> 01:31:02,595
Hold me, Brother Zekiel.
Hold me in your strong arms.

1096
01:31:05,140 --> 01:31:07,040
I'm holding you, honey.

1097
01:31:08,510 --> 01:31:10,307
I'm holding you, baby.

1098
01:31:11,279 --> 01:31:14,510
Holding you in my heart, forever.

1099
01:31:16,184 --> 01:31:18,345
I is scared, Brother Zekiel.

1100
01:31:19,621 --> 01:31:21,646
I is scared to meet the Lord...

1101
01:31:23,158 --> 01:31:24,489
so scared.

1102
01:31:49,884 --> 01:31:52,853
Who done this? Who done this?

1103
01:31:57,225 --> 01:31:59,853
I know. I know!

1104
01:31:59,928 --> 01:32:03,125
She hurt? I couldn't help it. The wheel...

1105
01:32:08,002 --> 01:32:09,993
What's the matter with this thing?

1106
01:32:14,042 --> 01:32:16,033
Whoa there, boy. Whoa!

1107
01:34:13,728 --> 01:34:16,322
Oh, my!

1108
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:05,073
Don't kill me, don't...

1109
01:35:16,791 --> 01:35:19,555
<i>This old hammer kill John Henry</i>

1110
01:35:19,627 --> 01:35:21,424
<i>But it won't kill me</i>

1111
01:35:22,130 --> 01:35:24,291
<i>No it won't kill me</i>

1112
01:35:25,066 --> 01:35:28,297
<i>There ain't no hammer</i>

1113
01:35:28,369 --> 01:35:33,204
<i>On this mountaintop</i>

1114
01:35:36,010 --> 01:35:39,104
<i>That rings like mine</i>

1115
01:35:53,895 --> 01:35:57,160
<i>Going home</i>

1116
01:35:57,966 --> 01:36:01,197
<i>Going home</i>

1117
01:36:01,269 --> 01:36:06,229
<i>I'm a going home</i>

1118
01:36:08,276 --> 01:36:11,245
<i>Quiet like</i>

1119
01:36:11,312 --> 01:36:14,907
<i>Some still day</i>

1120
01:36:15,016 --> 01:36:19,976
<i>I'm just going home</i>

1121
01:36:22,023 --> 01:36:25,823
<i>It's not far</i>

1122
01:36:26,127 --> 01:36:29,528
<i>Just close by</i>

1123
01:36:29,998 --> 01:36:34,935
<i>Through an open door</i>

1124
01:36:37,739 --> 01:36:41,402
<i>Work all done</i>

1125
01:36:41,709 --> 01:36:45,076
<i>Care laid by</i>

1126
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:50,417
<i>Time to fear no more</i>

1127
01:36:53,121 --> 01:36:56,147
<i>Mother's there</i>

1128
01:36:56,224 --> 01:36:59,250
<i>Expecting me</i>

1129
01:36:59,327 --> 01:37:04,287
<i>Father's waiting, too</i>

1130
01:37:06,034 --> 01:37:09,561
<i>Lots of folks</i>

1131
01:37:09,671 --> 01:37:13,573
<i>Gathered there</i>

1132
01:37:13,741 --> 01:37:18,701
<i>All the friends I knew</i>

1133
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:27,510
<i>All the friends I knew</i>

1134
01:37:51,979 --> 01:37:53,139
Mammy.

1135
01:37:55,950 --> 01:38:00,046
Zeke! Oh, my boy.

1136
01:38:00,555 --> 01:38:02,352
Thank God!

1137
01:38:05,326 --> 01:38:08,352
I'm so glad you come, my son.

1138
01:38:09,597 --> 01:38:11,326
Oh, thank God.

1139
01:38:23,177 --> 01:38:27,113
- Where do you come from, Zeke?
- Brother, you gone and left us.

1140
01:38:27,181 --> 01:38:29,741
Brother Zeke, where do you come from?
We're glad to see you back.

1141
01:38:29,817 --> 01:38:31,944
You don't look well, Brother Zeke.

1142
01:38:32,453 --> 01:38:34,944
Pappy, can I come into your house?

1143
01:38:35,289 --> 01:38:38,258
Boy, you're just in time
to help us with the picking.

1144
01:38:40,361 --> 01:38:42,795
Missy Rose,
you ain't forgotten me, is you?

1145
01:38:49,704 --> 01:38:52,138
Of course not. I love you too much.

1146
01:38:58,479 --> 01:39:00,572
Do you, sure enough, honey?

1147
01:39:00,815 --> 01:39:03,716
Son, you must be mighty hungry.

1148
01:39:04,152 --> 01:39:07,747
Don't you want
some chitlins and spare ribs?

1149
01:39:07,922 --> 01:39:11,824
- Mammy, I likes anything you cook.
- Come on, then.
