Rubles?
All right!

565
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:32,308
Now then, let's see.
There are eight rubles to the pound...

566
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:35,010
so we simply divide
5,000 by eight.

567
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:37,143
- [Crunching]
- Eight into 50 goes six-

Guests!

569
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:45,627
Six eights are 48...

carry the two,
bring down the zero.

571
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:51,959
Eight into 20 goes twice,
eight to 16. Four over.

572
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:54,128
Carry the four,
bring down the zero.

573
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:57,139
Eight into 40
goes five times!

574
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:59,471
Spit that out.

575
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,070
Spit it out,

579
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:27,860
7,000.

580
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:33,500
- 7,000 rubles.
- French francs.

581
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:36,044
F-French francs?

582
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:40,048
Of course! [Whispers]
Quick, get the daily paper.

583
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:43,051

7,000 French francs.

584
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:45,053
What's a franc
going for today?

585
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:46,383
A franc is 11.18.

586
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,720
A franc is 11.18
to the pound...

587
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:51,555
so I simply put down
11.18-

588
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:53,892
Oh, Christ,
how do you do this?

589
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:56,397
- Just put down 11.18.
- Oh, sure, I wouldn't know...

590
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,559
even to put down
11.18.

591
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:01,001
What I'm asking, you idiot,
is whether you multiply or divide.

592
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,004
- Divide.
- Are you sure?

593
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,370
- Yes.
- I'll kill you if you screw this up.

594
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:09,707
Now then, we simply
divide 11.18...

595
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:13,010
into 7,000.

596
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,516
What do I do with
the decimal point?

597
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:18,019
You move the decimal point
two places to the right.

598
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,521
You mean I divide
1,118 into 7,000?

599
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,854
- 700,000.
- What?

600
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,190
Well, you add two zeros
to the 7,000...

601
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:29,197
to make up for moving the decimal point
two places to the right.

602
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:33,292
Well, what the hell did we move
the decimal point for in the first place?

In that case,

- How are you?
- Never better.

- You?
- Tip-top.

Just leave it on that table,
would you?

1037
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:01,987
Don't you have to get it
to Lord Redcliff?

1038
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:04,991
I think it will be
in his hands...

Holmes, how can you
ever repay him?

Watson.

- Hello.

What do you call
this kind of a day?

1045
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:42,320
This is a crazy day.

- Aren't you being married in a few minutes?
- I most certainly am.

Your telegram said urgent.

1048
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:52,071
Urgent?
Is that what I said?

1049
01:26:52,173 --> 01:26:55,006
I didn't- I'm- l-
What did I say, "urgent"?

1050
01:26:55,109 --> 01:26:59,011
- Yes.
- I just wanted to say good-bye.

1051
01:27:00,515 --> 01:27:02,244
Good-bye.

Good-bye.
