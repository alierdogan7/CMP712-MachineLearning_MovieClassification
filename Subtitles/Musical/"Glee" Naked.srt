1
00:00:02,667 --> 00:00:04,134
<i>Mr. Clarington!</i>

2
00:00:04,168 --> 00:00:05,568
Mr. Clarington! Mr. Clarington!

3
00:00:05,603 --> 00:00:08,304
What do you have to say
about the steroid allegations?

4
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:09,660
I look forward
to my day in court.

5
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:11,241
Until then, I have no comment.

6
00:00:11,275 --> 00:00:14,144
<i>Uh, what about the report
that you look way too old</i>

7
00:00:14,178 --> 00:00:15,679
to still be in high school?

8
00:00:15,713 --> 00:00:16,680
Hey, hey, hey!

9
00:00:16,714 --> 00:00:18,348
What is your problem?!

10
00:00:18,382 --> 00:00:19,849
A blood test administered

11
00:00:19,884 --> 00:00:22,852
by the Show Choir
Governing Board tested positive

12
00:00:22,887 --> 00:00:24,821
for performance-enhancing drugs,

13
00:00:24,855 --> 00:00:27,590
stripping Dalton Academy
of their Sectionals title

14
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:30,093
and sending Lima's own
McKinley High School Show Choir

15
00:00:30,127 --> 00:00:34,864
to Regionals and a chance
to repeat as National Champions.

16
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:39,169
I can't believe it. This is what
they think news is news now?!

17
00:00:39,203 --> 00:00:41,838
Andrea... I can't
take this anymore.

18
00:00:41,872 --> 00:00:45,175
I cannot... take this...
anymore!

19
00:00:45,209 --> 00:00:46,376
I've had it!

20
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,777
I've had enough!

21
00:00:47,812 --> 00:00:50,180
<i>I went to school for this?!</i>

22
00:00:52,783 --> 00:00:54,751
Well, it looks like
someone's getting a younger,

23
00:00:54,785 --> 00:00:57,087
hotter co-anchor.

24
00:00:57,121 --> 00:01:01,024
After the break, a Fort Wayne
squirrel who's also... a doctor?

25
00:01:01,058 --> 00:01:02,558
We'll be right back.

26
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,595


27
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:12,202
All right, people, we are back!

28
00:01:12,236 --> 00:01:14,037
First of all,

29
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:16,372
big props to Sam and Blaine
for all their hard work

30
00:01:16,407 --> 00:01:19,709
to make this happen. But...
there's no time to celebrate.

31
00:01:19,744 --> 00:01:22,078
We just lost three weeks of
prep time for Regionals, and

32
00:01:22,113 --> 00:01:23,646
we still have
to raise $400 to pay

33
00:01:23,681 --> 00:01:25,882
for the bus to get to
the competition in Indianapolis.

34
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:27,383
It's the Paris of Indiana.

35
00:01:27,418 --> 00:01:28,551
I propose a bake sale.

36
00:01:28,586 --> 00:01:31,254
I mean... it worked last time.

37
00:01:31,288 --> 00:01:33,323
Well, that's because Puck spiked
the cupcakes with Mary Jane.

38
00:01:33,357 --> 00:01:34,324
I'd be willing
to cut off my hair

39
00:01:34,358 --> 00:01:35,398
to sell it for extra cash.

40
00:01:35,426 --> 00:01:36,326
To who?

41
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,228
Jamaican kids
with Rastafarian cancer?

42
00:01:38,262 --> 00:01:40,330
Or as rigging
on a haunted pirate ship?

43
00:01:40,364 --> 00:01:41,898
I could sell more of my semen.

44
00:01:41,932 --> 00:01:44,667
This is silly. I know exactly
how we're gonna get the money.

45
00:01:46,704 --> 00:01:48,071
"The Men of McKinley" calendar.

46
00:01:48,105 --> 00:01:49,239
Let's face it... this is

47
00:01:49,273 --> 00:01:51,241
the cutest crop
of Glee boys we've ever had.

48
00:01:51,275 --> 00:01:52,242
That's great. And it's January,

49
00:01:52,276 --> 00:01:54,177
so it's the perfect time
to sell them.

50
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:56,613
There are six guys, so each
one can take two months.

51
00:01:56,647 --> 00:01:58,581
I think Blaine should
definitely be December.

52
00:01:58,616 --> 00:02:01,084
You can do a Santa
thing but sexy.

53
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:02,418
Sexy Claus.

54
00:02:02,453 --> 00:02:04,754
I'm in as long
as I can take my shirt off.

55
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:06,790
Wait, why does it have
to be just the men?

56
00:02:06,824 --> 00:02:08,458
Why can't we objectify
the girls, too?

57
00:02:08,492 --> 00:02:09,592
'Cause girls are the ones
that buy stuff.

58
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:10,794
We're responsible
for the consumer-

59
00:02:10,828 --> 00:02:12,529
<i>driven economy.
Those Twilight books</i>

60
00:02:12,563 --> 00:02:13,863
are poop on paper,
and we've turned them

61
00:02:13,898 --> 00:02:17,600
into a billion-dollar industry.
Team Jacob.

62
00:02:17,635 --> 00:02:18,701
This could actually work.

63
00:02:18,736 --> 00:02:21,104
Tina... you're in charge.

64
00:02:21,138 --> 00:02:22,972
You can set up the photo shoots.
Everybody else,

65
00:02:23,007 --> 00:02:24,941
pick your months and
work on your concepts.

66
00:02:24,975 --> 00:02:25,975
Good job, Tina!

67
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:31,281
Hey, what are you doing
after school today? Um...

68
00:02:31,315 --> 00:02:33,149
♪ Fondue for Two! Hey! ♪

69
00:02:33,184 --> 00:02:35,652
♪ Fondue for Two,
that's some hot dish ♪

70
00:02:35,686 --> 00:02:37,720
♪ Fondue for Two! ♪

71
00:02:37,755 --> 00:02:39,556
<i>Welcome back to Fondue for Two.</i>

72
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,658
You may know tonight's guest
only as the girl

73
00:02:41,692 --> 00:02:44,460
with the fat mom who ruined
Sectionals for everybody.

74
00:02:44,495 --> 00:02:47,297
Please give it up for McKinley's
very own... Marley Rose.

75
00:02:48,866 --> 00:02:51,835
So, Marley, is it true
that you spent six hours

76
00:02:51,869 --> 00:02:53,503
<i>waiting in line to see
The Hunger Games?</i>

77
00:02:53,537 --> 00:02:54,737
I love those books.

78
00:02:54,772 --> 00:02:56,772
So do you think that you
relate <i>to The Hunger Games</i>

79
00:02:56,774 --> 00:02:58,074
because you yourself
are hungry?

80
00:03:01,512 --> 00:03:05,348
When I was growing up, my mom
said that I was a pet psychic.

81
00:03:05,382 --> 00:03:06,983
That's cool.
So, can you tell me

82
00:03:07,017 --> 00:03:08,651
what Lord Tubbington
is thinking right now?

83
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:09,485
Yeah.

84
00:03:11,222 --> 00:03:13,656
I think he wants to lose some
weight, and he has an online

85
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:14,757
gambling addiction.

86
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:15,992
Wrong.

87
00:03:16,026 --> 00:03:17,327
If you would've told me
that Lord Tubbington

88
00:03:17,361 --> 00:03:19,829
was secretly a slumlord,
I would've believed you.

89
00:03:19,864 --> 00:03:21,764
None of your high-rises
are up to code.

90
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:23,833
Those families are living in
squalor and they deserve better.

91
00:03:23,868 --> 00:03:25,835
Aah! Oh! This is boiling hot!

92
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,338
Let's talk about boys.

93
00:03:28,372 --> 00:03:29,733
Please admit
to my viewing audience

94
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,207
that you are in love with Jake.

95
00:03:32,376 --> 00:03:34,010
I thought so.

96
00:03:34,044 --> 00:03:36,779
If Jake is brave enough to take
off his clothes for Glee's.

97
00:03:36,814 --> 00:03:38,014
Men of McKinley calendar,

98
00:03:38,048 --> 00:03:40,183
don't you think you owe him
the same courtesy?

99
00:03:40,217 --> 00:03:42,018
You mean, take off my clothes?

100
00:03:42,052 --> 00:03:43,887
No. I meant that you...

101
00:03:43,921 --> 00:03:45,889
should be honest
and vulnerable and tell him

102
00:03:45,923 --> 00:03:47,390
exactly how you feel.

103
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,128
Sexy teen imbeciles.

104
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:54,530
The S.A.T. scores are in,

105
00:03:54,565 --> 00:03:58,434
and you have managed to receive
the highest and lowest scores

106
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:00,370
ever recorded at McKinley!

107
00:04:00,404 --> 00:04:01,704
Yes!

108
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:03,072
I knew it. Secret genius.

109
00:04:03,107 --> 00:04:07,543
Brittany S. Pierce has
received a near-perfect 2340

110
00:04:07,578 --> 00:04:09,879
on her exam. Wait, what? How?

111
00:04:09,914 --> 00:04:11,581
Clearly, she cheated.
No, I did not cheat.

112
00:04:11,615 --> 00:04:13,216
I swear.

113
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,884
All I did was I filled
in "A" for a while

114
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,386
and then "C" for a
little bit and then "D"

115
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,721
and then I did "A" again and
then I used the dots to draw

116
00:04:18,756 --> 00:04:20,723
a clown and then a penis.

117
00:04:20,758 --> 00:04:23,059
Wait...
What were my scores?

118
00:04:23,093 --> 00:04:25,595
You got a 340,
which in clinical trials

119
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:28,831
is a score routinely
bested by monkeys.

120
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,835
Sam... don't worry, okay?

121
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,638
You don't need to go to
college like the rest of us.

122
00:04:35,673 --> 00:04:37,273
You have a really great body.

123
00:04:37,308 --> 00:04:39,342
You could be a personal
trainer. You could...

124
00:04:39,376 --> 00:04:41,010
be a greeter at Abercrombie.
You could be a greeter

125
00:04:41,045 --> 00:04:43,079
at Abercrombie's
corporate headquarters...

126
00:04:43,113 --> 00:04:44,914
Whatever you want to do...
but meanwhile,

127
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:46,249
my future looks bright.
I'm gonna graduate.

128
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:48,751
I'll go to Harvard
or "Princetown"

129
00:04:48,786 --> 00:04:51,087
or "MITT" or "Stanford and Son"

130
00:04:51,121 --> 00:04:52,922
or the "University of
California at Charles."

131
00:04:52,957 --> 00:04:55,258
Barkley's House,"
'cause evidently

132
00:04:55,292 --> 00:04:58,294
I'm one of the smartest
people in America.

133
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:04,167
Your audition was great, Rachel.

134
00:05:04,201 --> 00:05:06,035
I don't need to hear
you read it again.

135
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:10,306
Look, this film is
my senior thesis,

136
00:05:10,341 --> 00:05:12,608
and I'd like you
to be a part of it.

137
00:05:12,643 --> 00:05:13,609
Any questions?

138
00:05:13,644 --> 00:05:15,878
Your script, Electra...
it's so raw

139
00:05:15,913 --> 00:05:17,680
and personal.
I just was wondering, um...

140
00:05:17,715 --> 00:05:20,616
<i>A Journey into Alzheimer's...</i>

141
00:05:20,651 --> 00:05:23,219
is that you
and-and your grandmother?

142
00:05:23,253 --> 00:05:28,491
The grandmother slipping into
dementia is... an allegory.

143
00:05:28,525 --> 00:05:29,959
Of course. Yeah. Obviously.

144
00:05:29,994 --> 00:05:30,827
Of the end of the world.

145
00:05:30,861 --> 00:05:32,128
You would be playing

146
00:05:32,162 --> 00:05:36,799
both me and, in the black-and-white
flashbacks, my grandmother.

147
00:05:36,834 --> 00:05:38,301
Okay.

148
00:05:38,335 --> 00:05:40,303
If you're willing to go
on this adventure with me.

149
00:05:40,337 --> 00:05:41,571
I... I would be honored.

150
00:05:41,605 --> 00:05:42,905
I would.

151
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,307
Great. There is one thing:

152
00:05:44,341 --> 00:05:48,311
You will have to be topless in
the ballroom scene with Titus.

153
00:05:48,345 --> 00:05:49,906
That's not going
to be a problem, is it?

154
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:58,254
I'm a strong
and confident woman.

155
00:05:58,288 --> 00:06:00,256
I'm the one who asked Brody
to move in.

156
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,525
<i>I'm the one who almost made it
out of Agent Provocateur</i>

157
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:03,993
without giggling.
And let's face it,

158
00:06:04,028 --> 00:06:06,362
my breasts are my prizewinners.

159
00:06:06,397 --> 00:06:08,331
You almost made it out,
but you didn't.

160
00:06:08,365 --> 00:06:09,332
Let's face it.

161
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:10,833
You're also the girl
who makes Brody

162
00:06:10,868 --> 00:06:12,368
turn the lights off
when you're cuddling.

163
00:06:12,403 --> 00:06:14,337
You have a beautiful body,
but are you really ready

164
00:06:14,371 --> 00:06:16,172
to expose yourself to the world?

165
00:06:16,206 --> 00:06:17,607
That what all great artists do.

166
00:06:17,641 --> 00:06:19,275
They expose themselves.

167
00:06:25,115 --> 00:06:28,017
Expose their
souls, not their flesh.

168
00:06:28,052 --> 00:06:29,952
But it's all part
of the same package.

169
00:06:29,987 --> 00:06:31,687
A-Am I really expected
to be able

170
00:06:31,722 --> 00:06:34,223
to bare my soul if I'm ashamed
of the body that holds it?

171
00:06:34,258 --> 00:06:36,359
I think a little shame
is a good thing.

172
00:06:36,393 --> 00:06:37,693
You're not a porn star,

173
00:06:37,728 --> 00:06:39,569
even though your hair
and your makeup makes you

174
00:06:39,596 --> 00:06:41,197
- look like one.
-  That's mean.

I'm sorry. But... your hair has
gotten a little out of hand.

Point taken.

177
00:06:45,002 --> 00:06:46,536
Well, I guess there's only
one way to resolve this.

178
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,071
Sing about it. Thank God.

179
00:06:48,105 --> 00:06:49,172

I need to know right away,

227
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,027
so we can get you fitted
for clown shoes

228
00:09:25,062 --> 00:09:27,863
for the "End of Times"
dream sequence.

229

I'll do it.

230
00:09:33,301 --> 00:09:35,469
Hey, Blaine.

231
00:09:35,503 --> 00:09:37,904
Will you please go to the mall
with me after school?

232
00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:39,206
I want to go clothes shopping.
Sure.

238
00:09:56,591 --> 00:09:58,091
What are you doing?
It's January.

239
00:09:58,126 --> 00:10:00,393
What do you mean?
It's hot out there, you know?

240
00:10:00,428 --> 00:10:02,068
Sun's out, it's, like,
way above freezing.

241
00:10:02,096 --> 00:10:04,931
Are you sure you're not
overcompensating a little?

242
00:10:04,966 --> 00:10:06,399
Overcompensating for what?

243
00:10:06,434 --> 00:10:07,734
Your S.A.T. scores.

244
00:10:07,768 --> 00:10:08,768
We all heard that you tanked.

245
00:10:08,803 --> 00:10:10,270
But don't worry.
There are re-tests.

246
00:10:10,304 --> 00:10:11,404
You know what, dude?
Like, if you

247
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:12,739
choose to be jealous
of my hard-core

248
00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:13,940
rockin' bod, that's on you.

249
00:10:13,975 --> 00:10:15,909
Uh, for the record,
Blaine has an awesome body

250
00:10:15,943 --> 00:10:17,144
and a perky
and delicious behind

251
00:10:17,178 --> 00:10:18,778
that looks like
it got baked to perfection

252
00:10:18,813 --> 00:10:20,347
by some sort of master chef.

253
00:10:21,115 --> 00:10:22,916
Thanks, Tina.

254
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,317
Sam, I'm just
looking out for you.

255
00:10:24,352 --> 00:10:25,685
I'm trying to be your friend.
Okay, well,

256
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,987
then put down the Hatorade
and come

257
00:10:27,021 --> 00:10:28,955
to my seminar this afternoon.
Your seminar?

258
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,551
Yeah... for
the Men of McKinley calendar.

259
00:10:30,558 --> 00:10:32,859
- It's a one-hour course- ".

260
00:10:32,894 --> 00:10:34,928
Techniques that Work
for Today's Hot Young Posers."

261
00:10:34,962 --> 00:10:37,030
3:30. Locker room.

262
00:10:37,064 --> 00:10:38,365
No chicks.

263
00:10:41,903 --> 00:10:43,904
Downward dog.

264
00:10:45,072 --> 00:10:47,874
Into the half pigeon.

265
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:53,613
Feel it in the buttocks
right there.

266
00:10:53,648 --> 00:10:56,216
And now back into
the lotus position.

267
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,717
Relax.

268
00:10:57,752 --> 00:10:59,619
Why are we doing this again?

269
00:10:59,654 --> 00:11:01,288
It's Bro-ga... yoga for bros.

270
00:11:01,322 --> 00:11:04,791
All about getting in the best
possible shape for the calendar.

271
00:11:04,825 --> 00:11:07,460
Well, not everyone in here
looks like they're on the CW.

272
00:11:07,495 --> 00:11:09,729
Some of us are more... PBS.

273
00:11:09,764 --> 00:11:12,732
Does the calendar really need
to be shirtless?

274
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,067
Afraid so, dude.

275
00:11:14,101 --> 00:11:15,168
But don't sweat it,
'cause in no time,

276
00:11:15,203 --> 00:11:16,403
we'll all be centerfold-ready,

277
00:11:16,437 --> 00:11:17,971
thanks to White Chocolate's
Strip Tips.

278
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:19,573
Rule number one...
manscape, all right?

279
00:11:19,607 --> 00:11:21,641
Nobody wants to see
those rando nipple pubes,

280
00:11:21,676 --> 00:11:24,144
or even worse, a back that looks
like Chewbacca's ass.

281
00:11:24,178 --> 00:11:26,513
No offense, Joe. Shave it off!

282
00:11:26,547 --> 00:11:28,648
And who says
you can't pack a little extra?

283
00:11:28,683 --> 00:11:29,816
I like baby socks.

284
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,351
Now, just make sure
the sock is clean

285
00:11:31,385 --> 00:11:33,353
so you don't get any
athlete's foot on your junk.

286
00:11:33,387 --> 00:11:34,988

this party started!

Yes!
What?

346
00:13:31,138 --> 00:13:32,872
You guys!

347
00:13:32,907 --> 00:13:34,374
You guys, that was amazing!

348
00:13:34,408 --> 00:13:36,276
We are going
to make so much money!

349
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,444
Yeah!

350
00:13:37,478 --> 00:13:38,845
Yeah!

351
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:40,399
Yeah.
That was really good.

352
00:13:46,654 --> 00:13:47,787
Here goes.

353
00:13:47,822 --> 00:13:50,490
Well, well, well, if
it isn't underage,

354
00:13:50,524 --> 00:13:53,460
smut-peddling,
non-teacher Finn Hudson.

355
00:13:53,494 --> 00:13:54,961
Not satisfied
with making a mockery

356
00:13:54,995 --> 00:13:56,496
of the American education system

357
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,365
by your mere presence
at this school,

358
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,967
you have besmirched the dignity
of such everyday heroes

359
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:04,704
as this woman with Crohn's disease...
whose name I do not know...

360
00:14:04,739 --> 00:14:07,507
by bringing the dark specter
of pornography

361
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,509
to these hallowed halls.

362
00:14:09,543 --> 00:14:13,146
Well, Crohnsey and I are here to
tell you, this will not stand.

363
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,383
Sue Sylvester,
you can suck a hot one

364
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:18,518
because you are a hypocrite.

365
00:14:20,521 --> 00:14:23,156
I beg your pardon!

366
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,657
I seem to recall a rumor

367
00:14:24,692 --> 00:14:26,860
about a certain cheerleading
coach at this school

368
00:14:26,894 --> 00:14:28,828
who once took horse estrogen

369
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,530
<i>and posed for Penthouse,
back in the day.</i>

370
00:14:30,564 --> 00:14:32,332
<i>So maybe I can just
track that down,</i>

371
00:14:32,366 --> 00:14:35,235
make a few copies and sell those
to raise money for Regionals.

372
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:38,071
That's nothing but a rumor.

373
00:14:38,105 --> 00:14:40,073
But if that rumor were true,

374
00:14:40,107 --> 00:14:42,842
<i>my Penthouse centerfold,
so groundbreaking</i>

375
00:14:42,877 --> 00:14:45,078
that it completely
redefined the term "hirsute,"

376
00:14:45,112 --> 00:14:47,847
and gave birth unto these
United States a pose so limber,

377
00:14:47,882 --> 00:14:51,918
they named it The Regal American
Not-So-Bald Spread-Eagle.

378
00:14:51,952 --> 00:14:56,589
I promise you, my friend,
you would never find it.

379
00:14:56,624 --> 00:15:00,026
Well... I guess
we'll see about that.

380
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:25,552
Good morning.

381
00:15:25,586 --> 00:15:26,920
Hi.

382
00:15:26,954 --> 00:15:28,388
What?

383
00:15:28,422 --> 00:15:31,057
Your boyfriend's bare ass
is on one of my vintage

384
00:15:31,091 --> 00:15:32,258
flea market chairs!

385
00:15:32,293 --> 00:15:33,593
Hey, I'm not ashamed
of my body.

386
00:15:33,627 --> 00:15:35,128
And I wanted to show Rachel

387
00:15:35,162 --> 00:15:37,597
that I support her choice
completely.

388
00:15:37,631 --> 00:15:39,466
Thank you. I was cast
in a student art film,

389
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,468
and I'm going to be doing
a topless scene in it.

390
00:15:41,502 --> 00:15:42,268
No, you're not.

391
00:15:42,303 --> 00:15:43,736
Rachel looks smoking.

392
00:15:43,771 --> 00:15:46,239
Rachel is a serious actress,
Brody.

393
00:15:46,273 --> 00:15:47,440
<i>She doesn't do nudity.</i>

394
00:15:47,475 --> 00:15:49,242
Look, as performers,
that's a question

395
00:15:49,276 --> 00:15:50,944
that we're all
gonna have to face.

396
00:15:50,978 --> 00:15:54,247
If you want to win an Oscar,
you have to show your boobs.

397
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:59,452
Kate Winslet, Jennifer Connelly,
Kathy Bates... I don't get it.

398
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,921
A year ago, you were all
plaid skirts, and, "Do you think."

399
00:16:01,956 --> 00:16:03,423
Finn likes me?"

400
00:16:03,457 --> 00:16:06,259
And now, you're Slutty Barbie
asking Misogynist Ken

401
00:16:06,293 --> 00:16:07,260
to move in with you,
doing pornos.

402
00:16:07,294 --> 00:16:08,461
What's happening to you?

403
00:16:08,496 --> 00:16:09,929
I'm growing up, Kurt.

404
00:16:09,964 --> 00:16:11,124
Maybe you should try it, too.

405
00:16:11,131 --> 00:16:12,265
And it's not a porno.

406
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:13,967
It's a good movie.
I'm gonna do it,

407
00:16:14,001 --> 00:16:17,136
with or without your support.

408
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:24,310
When I get a text
saying, "Emergency."

409
00:16:24,345 --> 00:16:26,880
Meet me in the auditorium,"
I assume that you're on fire,

410
00:16:26,914 --> 00:16:29,349
or being attacked by a
pack of monkeys. I was.

411
00:16:29,383 --> 00:16:33,286
But the monkeys had squirt guns,
and they put the fire out.

412
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,621
That sounded funnier
in my head.

413
00:16:34,655 --> 00:16:38,291
Uh, seriously, I...
I wanted to start working

414
00:16:38,325 --> 00:16:40,560
on some song ideas
I had for Regionals.

415
00:16:40,594 --> 00:16:42,695
I kind of have
some redeeming to do.

416
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,964
No, you don't.
Everyone is cool with you now.

417
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:46,799
No, they aren't.
Okay, they're not.

418
00:16:46,834 --> 00:16:48,801
But don't put too much
pressure on yourself.

419
00:16:48,836 --> 00:16:50,803
That's how things got
messed up last time.

420
00:16:50,838 --> 00:16:53,840
I think I have
the perfect song for us to sing.

421
00:16:53,874 --> 00:16:55,642
I like this tune.

422
00:16:55,676 --> 00:16:57,010
It's super romantic.

423
00:16:57,044 --> 00:16:58,678

You have something
you want to tell me, I can tell.

458
00:19:52,586 --> 00:19:55,388
I...

459
00:19:57,091 --> 00:19:59,092
I love...

460
00:20:01,195 --> 00:20:05,965
the song. I love the song, but
it's not right for Regionals.

461
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,659
What's going on?

462
00:20:28,631 --> 00:20:31,099
Sue Sylvester's coming down
super hard on the calendar.

463
00:20:31,134 --> 00:20:32,601
She's saying it's pornography.

464
00:20:32,635 --> 00:20:34,503
<i>Wait. Isn't she the one
that posed for Playboy?</i>

465
00:20:34,537 --> 00:20:36,772
<i>Penthouse, and I need you
to track it down.</i>

466
00:20:36,806 --> 00:20:38,640
Hold up.

467
00:20:38,675 --> 00:20:41,510
You want me to spend the next
few days carefully paging

468
00:20:41,544 --> 00:20:43,946
through decades and decades
of vintage pornography?

469
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,281
You've come to the right place.

470
00:20:46,316 --> 00:20:48,784
Thank you, and the
Men of McKinley thank you.

471
00:20:48,818 --> 00:20:50,619
Finn... about that.

472
00:20:50,653 --> 00:20:52,955
I'm not sure I want to pose
for the calendar.

473
00:20:52,989 --> 00:20:56,291
My body is sort of... broken.

474
00:20:56,326 --> 00:20:59,161
And I'm not really eager
to start showing it off.

475
00:20:59,195 --> 00:21:02,965
Okay, well, uh, we'll
get you in some sweats

476
00:21:02,999 --> 00:21:04,833
and a kick-ass muscle shirt.

477
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:07,469
Look, I really want to help out,
but I just think a photo of me

478
00:21:07,503 --> 00:21:09,304
is going to end up
being a photo of my chair.

479
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:11,306
Then forget the chair.
You can lay

480
00:21:11,341 --> 00:21:12,574
on a bed or something and pose

481
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:14,009
with, like, a bunch
of sexy pillows.

482
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,345
Finn, you're not hearing me.

483
00:21:16,379 --> 00:21:18,347
I don't want
to pose for the calendar.

484
00:21:18,381 --> 00:21:20,048
And that whole pillow scenario

485
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,150
you just described
sounds deeply emasculating.

486
00:21:22,185 --> 00:21:24,853
It's not just girls
who have body issues.

487
00:21:24,887 --> 00:21:26,488
Sometimes guys aren't cool

488
00:21:26,522 --> 00:21:28,156
with showing off their bodies,
either.

489
00:21:28,191 --> 00:21:29,491
Then don't.

490
00:21:29,525 --> 00:21:31,593
I-I don't want to
make you do anything

491
00:21:31,628 --> 00:21:32,861
you don't feel
comfortable doing.

492
00:21:32,895 --> 00:21:34,496
Thanks for telling me.

493
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,498
And you know what?

494
00:21:36,532 --> 00:21:39,801
That was really brave of you,
saying no just then.

495
00:21:41,804 --> 00:21:43,872
And I think it's totally cool

496
00:21:43,906 --> 00:21:46,408
that there's a part of yourself
you want to keep private.

497
00:21:48,711 --> 00:21:50,245
I'm thinking about
naming my shoulders.

498
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:52,247
You know, like
The Situation has his abs?

499
00:21:52,281 --> 00:21:53,715
They could be my
signature thing.

500
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,118
One could be Smith
and the other could be Wesson.

501
00:21:56,152 --> 00:21:58,787
You name arms after guns,
not shoulders.

502
00:21:58,821 --> 00:22:00,061
Shoulders are part
of your arms.

503
00:22:00,089 --> 00:22:01,189
No, they aren't.
They're part of your shoulders.

504
00:22:01,224 --> 00:22:02,791
And don't pick a
signature when you know

505
00:22:02,825 --> 00:22:05,060
that my John Hancocks are
clearly better than yours.

506
00:22:05,094 --> 00:22:06,395
No, they're not.

507
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:08,096
Do I need to humiliate
you right now?

508
00:22:08,131 --> 00:22:09,531
Bring it.

509
00:22:13,136 --> 00:22:15,737
♪ Oh, yeah ♪

510
00:22:15,772 --> 00:22:16,705
They're on fire.

511
00:22:16,739 --> 00:22:17,606
♪ Oh, yeah ♪

512
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,707
I am a statue.

513
00:22:18,741 --> 00:22:21,109
There's our money-makers.

514
00:22:21,144 --> 00:22:23,211
This is the boys' locker room.
You can't be in here.

515
00:22:23,246 --> 00:22:24,246
We couldn't help ourselves.

516
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,049
Your chick magnets drew us in.
I wanted to talk to you about

517
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,784
the concepts for your pictures.

518
00:22:28,818 --> 00:22:29,785
Ryder, you're February and July.

519
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:32,721
I was thinking heart boxers
and a sexy Uncle Sam thing.

520
00:22:32,755 --> 00:22:33,789
You're going to be
June and October.

521
00:22:33,823 --> 00:22:35,891
June is a beach theme,
and for October

522
00:22:35,925 --> 00:22:38,226
you're just gonna be holding
a "Jake-o'-lantern"

523
00:22:38,261 --> 00:22:39,294
over your naughty bits.

524
00:22:39,328 --> 00:22:41,263
We're gonna go find
Artie and te him about

525
00:22:41,297 --> 00:22:42,931
his March sexy leprechaun.

526
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:48,236
I thought Kitty was gonna
jump you right in here.

527
00:22:48,271 --> 00:22:50,072
Dude, you want to know
the weirdest thing?

528
00:22:50,106 --> 00:22:52,941
Mm? If a girl in the
next room is into me,

529
00:22:52,975 --> 00:22:54,242
I can feel it.

530
00:22:54,277 --> 00:22:55,744
But since I've been
seeing Marley, it's like

531
00:22:55,778 --> 00:22:58,080
there's not another girl
on the planet.

532
00:22:58,114 --> 00:22:59,581
Wow. That is hard core.

533
00:22:59,615 --> 00:23:02,984
Dude, I'm sorry, I try not
to talk about her with you.

534
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:05,587
It stings sometimes,
but this is serious.

535
00:23:05,621 --> 00:23:06,822
All right,
you're really into her.

536
00:23:06,856 --> 00:23:08,490
Then, the other day, we
were singing this, like,

537
00:23:08,524 --> 00:23:09,758
romantic song together

538
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:12,427
and then, right at the end,
I thought that...

539
00:23:12,462 --> 00:23:14,930
she was gonna say it to me.

540
00:23:14,964 --> 00:23:16,231
Say what?

541
00:23:17,867 --> 00:23:21,937
Oh! Oh... It.

542
00:23:21,971 --> 00:23:23,939
Wha-What would you have done?

543
00:23:23,973 --> 00:23:25,674
I would have said it back.

544
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:27,843
I mean, that's the way I feel.

545
00:23:27,877 --> 00:23:29,277
Then you have
to tell her first.

546
00:23:29,312 --> 00:23:31,546
N... I can't do that.

547
00:23:31,581 --> 00:23:33,615
That's... terrifying.

548
00:23:33,649 --> 00:23:35,183
Chicks dig hot guys
who are willing

549
00:23:35,218 --> 00:23:36,485
to get naked for a calendar,

550
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:38,854
but what they're
really looking for

551
00:23:38,888 --> 00:23:41,056
is a guy who will
get naked emotionally.

Absolutely a contender
for Regionals.

597
00:26:15,478 --> 00:26:16,611
Who was that song for?

598
00:26:16,646 --> 00:26:18,813
Uh, that was for Marley.

599
00:26:18,848 --> 00:26:22,150
Is there anything else you
wanted to say to her?

600
00:26:22,184 --> 00:26:25,186
Uh, I think the song
pretty much said it.

601
00:26:29,825 --> 00:26:32,327
Kurt, the hipster from downstairs
with the curlicue mustache

602
00:26:32,361 --> 00:26:34,863
wants to borrow
your Russian hat.

603
00:26:34,897 --> 00:26:36,031
Oh, my God!

604
00:26:36,065 --> 00:26:37,198
What are you doing here?

605
00:26:37,233 --> 00:26:40,402
Lady Hummel called, begging us
to do an emergency intervention.

606
00:26:40,436 --> 00:26:41,136
On who?

607
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,103
You.

608
00:26:45,863 --> 00:26:47,841
You guys came all the way

609
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:49,109
to New York just to talk to me
because Kurt called you?

610
00:26:49,143 --> 00:26:50,477
We're also here to shop.

611
00:26:50,511 --> 00:26:52,279
And we're here to
apologize to Quinn

612
00:26:52,313 --> 00:26:55,048
for slapping her across
the face very, very hard.

613
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:56,783
In theory. We'll just
see if that happens.

614
00:26:56,818 --> 00:26:59,453
Rachel, you cannot
do a nude scene.

615
00:26:59,487 --> 00:27:01,988
It's not a nude scene, it's just
a topless scene. Same thing.

616
00:27:02,023 --> 00:27:04,224
Topless is as nude as anyone
is ever gonna want to see you.

617
00:27:04,258 --> 00:27:05,959
Let's say you do it.

618
00:27:05,993 --> 00:27:07,961
Think about the 2-2-2 rule.

619
00:27:07,995 --> 00:27:09,663
In two weeks,
how are you gonna feel about

620
00:27:09,697 --> 00:27:11,131
the nude scene? You'd
probably feel pretty great.

621
00:27:11,165 --> 00:27:12,132
Yeah.

622
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:14,501
You'll get to feel a nice,
cool breeze on them

623
00:27:14,535 --> 00:27:16,169
skeeter bites,
you'll feel refreshed, even.

624
00:27:16,204 --> 00:27:18,839
Then, how are you gonna feel
about it two months from now?

625
00:27:18,873 --> 00:27:20,340
I don't know.

626
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:21,341
Nervous?

627
00:27:21,376 --> 00:27:22,476
Worried it may not even be good?

628
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,144
Rachel, it's a student film.

629
00:27:24,178 --> 00:27:25,178
It's not gonna be good.

630
00:27:25,213 --> 00:27:27,080
And two years from now?

631
00:27:27,115 --> 00:27:28,582
How you gonna feel
about it then?

632
00:27:28,616 --> 00:27:29,716
Guilty.

633
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:32,352
Just... hoping my kids
won't ever see it online.

634
00:27:32,387 --> 00:27:33,720
Oh, they'll see it. Mm-hmm.

635
00:27:33,755 --> 00:27:35,155
And they will
never be the same.

636
00:27:35,189 --> 00:27:36,523
Okay, wait.

637
00:27:36,557 --> 00:27:38,825
Why am... why am I even
taking advice from you, okay?

638
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,661
Didn't you have a sex tape
that leaked online?

639
00:27:40,695 --> 00:27:41,995
Yes, I did.

640
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:44,531
A sex tape that follows
me around to this very day.

641
00:27:44,565 --> 00:27:46,533
Look my name up
on the Internet right now.

642
00:27:48,469 --> 00:27:51,505
"Santana Lopez,
nude, lez, boobies, sex tape,

643
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:53,673
Mexican or Dominican,
question mark."

644
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:55,509
Booyah. That will exist forever.

645
00:27:55,543 --> 00:27:58,678
But Santana, some women find it
empowering to be naked on film.

646
00:27:58,713 --> 00:28:00,347
Yes, but not in a student film

647
00:28:00,381 --> 00:28:02,849
that is probably about someone's
grandma with Alzheimer's.

648
00:28:02,884 --> 00:28:05,519
Look... we care about you.

649
00:28:05,553 --> 00:28:06,686
And for once, Rachel,

650
00:28:06,721 --> 00:28:09,122
we actually have your
best interests in mind.

651
00:28:09,157 --> 00:28:11,057
Please don't do it.

652
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:23,370
Give me sexy liberty.

653
00:28:23,404 --> 00:28:25,472
Give me sexy freedom.

654
00:28:25,506 --> 00:28:27,707
Give me "I want you" sexy.

655
00:28:27,742 --> 00:28:30,744
All right,
August is up next!

656
00:28:30,778 --> 00:28:32,212
Artie, are you sure
you don't want to pose?

657
00:28:32,246 --> 00:28:34,714
Oh, I'm happy posing with this
bounce-board over here.

658
00:28:34,749 --> 00:28:36,049
Hey!

659
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:37,751
Why don't we do August
with a few of the guys?

660
00:28:37,785 --> 00:28:39,386
Blaine, why don't
you jump in with Sam?

661
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,320
You're looking
particularly cute today.

662
00:28:40,354 --> 00:28:41,655
I'll do it, too.

663
00:28:41,689 --> 00:28:42,889
No offense, Joe,
but I don't really think

664
00:28:42,924 --> 00:28:44,658
you want to be
in a shot next to me.

665
00:28:44,692 --> 00:28:47,227
My washboards are gonna make you look
like a bloated white Bob Marley.

666
00:28:47,261 --> 00:28:48,728
I'm as God made me, dude.

667
00:28:48,763 --> 00:28:50,397
Look, the reality is that we
probably should have just done

668
00:28:50,431 --> 00:28:52,499
a Sam Evans calendar. Yes, and
every month we could see you

669
00:28:52,533 --> 00:28:54,094
dressed as a different
brand of jerkwad.

670
00:28:54,101 --> 00:28:55,101
Guys, we waited too long!

671
00:28:55,102 --> 00:28:56,069
I lost my pump.

672
00:28:56,103 --> 00:28:57,003
I need five minutes.

673
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:03,410
You got this. You got this!

674
00:29:03,444 --> 00:29:04,511
You're kind of out of control.

675
00:29:04,545 --> 00:29:05,612
Yeah, well, haters gonna hate.

676
00:29:05,646 --> 00:29:07,447
Will you please stop lifting?

677
00:29:07,482 --> 00:29:08,603
This isn't who you are, Sam.

678
00:29:08,616 --> 00:29:11,418
You're not just some
body-obsessed muscle head.

679
00:29:11,452 --> 00:29:12,486
You don't know what it's like.

680
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,480
You can sing and dance
and you kick butt in school

681
00:29:14,489 --> 00:29:15,589
and you're all charming
and everything,

682
00:29:15,623 --> 00:29:17,257
I have to announce my presence

683
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:18,992
with authority the second
I walk into a room.

684
00:29:19,026 --> 00:29:21,928
People have to notice me,
or else they never will.

685
00:29:21,963 --> 00:29:23,163
People laugh at my impressions

686
00:29:23,164 --> 00:29:24,931
because how I look
already has them on board.

687
00:29:24,966 --> 00:29:26,199
Do you really believe that?

688
00:29:26,234 --> 00:29:27,634
It's just a fact.

689
00:29:30,905 --> 00:29:33,206
If you want to make it in this
world, you have to be special.

690
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:34,608
But you are special.

691
00:29:34,642 --> 00:29:37,878
Even without your body.

692
00:29:37,912 --> 00:29:39,112
No, I'm not, man.

693
00:29:39,146 --> 00:29:41,281
It's... it's all I have.

694
00:29:41,315 --> 00:29:42,949
I'm exhausted.

695
00:29:42,984 --> 00:29:45,619
Watching what I eat all the
time, my two-a-day workouts...

696
00:29:45,653 --> 00:29:48,288
Let it go. Have a burger
every now and then.

697
00:29:48,322 --> 00:29:50,056
Eat a bag of Cheetos.

698
00:29:50,091 --> 00:29:51,558
Skip your workouts.

699
00:29:51,592 --> 00:29:52,659
Sleep in a little.

700
00:29:52,693 --> 00:29:54,060
Your body isn't going to change.

701
00:29:54,095 --> 00:29:58,632
And even if you have seven percent
body fat, you're gonna see

702
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:00,834
that all of us are
still gonna love you.

703
00:30:00,868 --> 00:30:02,836
And we're gonna laugh
at your impressions.

704
00:30:08,342 --> 00:30:10,644
And what, may I ask, is this?

705
00:30:10,678 --> 00:30:13,013
Turns out it wasn't too hard
to track down, after all.

706
00:30:13,047 --> 00:30:16,516
Well... I'm impressed;
I'm not gonna lie.

707
00:30:16,551 --> 00:30:19,786
I thought I'd purchased
every last issue from eBay.

708
00:30:20,955 --> 00:30:23,924
I'm not ashamed
of this centerfold.

709
00:30:23,958 --> 00:30:28,995
In fact, I feel like taking a
gander at that glorious taco

710
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:31,498
right now.

711
00:30:31,532 --> 00:30:33,033
You idiot.

712
00:30:33,067 --> 00:30:35,001
You had me skewered.

713
00:30:35,036 --> 00:30:36,870
Why on earth would you
let me open that?

714
00:30:36,904 --> 00:30:41,675
Because now... I have
your confession on tape.

715
00:30:41,709 --> 00:30:43,743
I'm not ashamed
of this centerfold.

716
00:30:43,778 --> 00:30:46,846
In fact, I feel like taking
a gander at that Checkmate.

717
00:30:46,881 --> 00:30:48,882
Glorious taco right now.

718
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,791
You want to see me?

719
00:30:57,825 --> 00:30:59,025
What are you doing here?

720
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,227
Blaine asked me to look
into something for you.

721
00:31:01,262 --> 00:31:03,029
Come on in and have a seat.

722
00:31:03,064 --> 00:31:04,965
This is a very small
sampling of colleges

723
00:31:04,999 --> 00:31:06,466
that don't require S.A.T.

724
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,968
or A.C.T. scores.

725
00:31:08,002 --> 00:31:10,136
And they're really
good schools, Sam.

726
00:31:10,171 --> 00:31:11,638
They're schools that
recognize that a test score

727
00:31:11,672 --> 00:31:13,206
isn't always the best measure
of your intelligence.

728
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,207
Or creativity.

729
00:31:14,241 --> 00:31:16,242
And you can always take the
SATs again if you want.

730
00:31:16,277 --> 00:31:17,557
You know, a lot of kids do that.

731
00:31:17,578 --> 00:31:19,898
Yeah, well, let's say I somehow
get into college somewhere.

732
00:31:19,914 --> 00:31:20,880
I still can't afford it.

733
00:31:20,915 --> 00:31:21,881
Yes, you can.

734
00:31:21,916 --> 00:31:23,083
Because even in this economy,

735
00:31:23,117 --> 00:31:24,417
there are hundreds
of scholarships out there.

736
00:31:24,452 --> 00:31:28,054
What you'll need for these is a
personal essay about yourself

737
00:31:28,089 --> 00:31:29,222
and your accomplishments.

738
00:31:29,256 --> 00:31:31,091
Like what? Like my abs
and my fish lips?

739
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:32,626
Like the Glee Club.

740
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,561
Like Student Council, the swimming...
Synchronized swimming.

741
00:31:34,595 --> 00:31:35,795
You've accomplished a lot more

742
00:31:35,796 --> 00:31:36,963
than you're giving yourself
credit for.

743
00:31:36,998 --> 00:31:40,100
But why don't you take that home
and, um, just think about it.

744
00:31:49,045 --> 00:31:51,714
You are lost.

745
00:31:51,748 --> 00:31:53,282
Is this real?

746
00:31:53,316 --> 00:31:56,952
You've been here before, but...
nothing looks familiar.

747
00:31:56,987 --> 00:32:00,723
And that smell,
you recognize that smell.

748
00:32:00,757 --> 00:32:04,827
Titus.

749
00:32:06,496 --> 00:32:08,631
You want him.

750
00:32:08,665 --> 00:32:12,668
And deep breath...
drop the robe.

751
00:32:14,271 --> 00:32:16,305
Rachel, drop the robe.

752
00:32:16,339 --> 00:32:18,474
Cut. I'm sorry, can we...
can we just cut?

753
00:32:18,508 --> 00:32:19,642
Only I'm allowed to say cut.

754
00:32:19,676 --> 00:32:20,743
Cut.

755
00:32:20,777 --> 00:32:22,812
I'm sorry, I don't mean
to be a diva or anything,

756
00:32:22,846 --> 00:32:26,015
but, um, there's just... there's
so many people here right now.

757
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:27,917
Do you think we can...?
They're here for you.

758
00:32:27,951 --> 00:32:29,919
My DP literally
sculpts with light.

759
00:32:29,953 --> 00:32:33,088
Now, he can't do that
without his crew.

760
00:32:33,123 --> 00:32:35,157
He's promised me this
would be sweeping.

761
00:32:35,192 --> 00:32:36,826
Would you like me to tell him

762
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,928
that you don't want it
to be sweeping?

763
00:32:38,962 --> 00:32:42,698
I need all the crew to...
to take off their clothes.

764
00:32:42,732 --> 00:32:45,568
Yeah, it'll help, it'll,
um, you know, just...

765
00:32:45,602 --> 00:32:48,838
distract, and, and, and...
take the attention off of me.

766
00:32:48,872 --> 00:32:51,173
Seriously? Yeah, that
sounds like a great idea.

767
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:52,675
Everybody, take
your shirts off.

768
00:33:03,053 --> 00:33:05,354
Okay, back to one.

769
00:33:05,388 --> 00:33:07,556
Roll sound.

770
00:33:07,591 --> 00:33:10,292
Scene ten, take two.
And action.

771
00:33:10,327 --> 00:33:12,027
Okay, you're lost.

772
00:33:12,062 --> 00:33:14,563
Are you awake, is this a dream?

773
00:33:14,598 --> 00:33:21,904
Perhaps a life lived long
ago, and now you see him:

774
00:33:21,938 --> 00:33:23,205
Titus.

775
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,876
You're filled with
a carnal hunger.

776
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:30,546
You need to be naked now.

777
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,082
And drop the robe.

778
00:33:33,116 --> 00:33:35,484
Rachel, drop the robel.

779
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,585
I'm sorry. Cut.

780
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,553
Stop saying "cut."

781
00:33:37,587 --> 00:33:39,488
I'm sorry; I can't do this.

782
00:33:39,523 --> 00:33:41,090
I respect you and

783
00:33:41,124 --> 00:33:44,994
I respect your movie,
but I just... I'm not ready.

784
00:33:45,028 --> 00:33:47,229
Then you should have told
me that when I asked you.

785
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,231
I was telling you the truth
when I said yes

786
00:33:49,266 --> 00:33:51,667
and I'm, I'm telling you
the truth now.

787
00:33:51,701 --> 00:33:53,569
I think it's okay
for actresses to be naked,

788
00:33:53,603 --> 00:33:57,306
and-and... and maybe someday
I'll be ready, but...

789
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:02,845
I just realized that... I'm
not ready to be naked now.

790
00:34:02,879 --> 00:34:05,180
Well, then, what you can do now

791
00:34:05,215 --> 00:34:07,349
is get the hell off my
grandmother's dreamscape.

792
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,254
Take five, everyone.

793
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:14,356
Looks like I will have
to play Grandma.

Thank you, guys, so much.

847
00:36:48,845 --> 00:36:51,747
It's like my dads say... you
can't make new old friends.

848
00:36:51,781 --> 00:36:52,781
No regrets? None.

849
00:36:52,816 --> 00:36:54,283
But do you guys have to go?
Can you stay

850
00:36:54,317 --> 00:36:55,651
a little bit longer? 'Cause I
would love to buy you dinner.

851
00:36:55,685 --> 00:36:57,252
I'm in. Sure.

852
00:36:57,287 --> 00:36:58,287
Good, okay.

853
00:36:58,321 --> 00:36:59,755
I'm in no rush
to get back to Kentucky.

854
00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:02,291
I think I could get used
to it here in New York.

855
00:37:02,325 --> 00:37:03,759
It's more my speed.

856
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,797
You ready to write that essay?

857
00:37:08,832 --> 00:37:10,599
No, I'm not.

858
00:37:10,633 --> 00:37:13,435
Well, I've been doing a little
research, um, with some folks

859
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,671
that know you
really well, and...

860
00:37:15,705 --> 00:37:19,174
they all seem to think that
you've actually accomplished

861
00:37:19,209 --> 00:37:21,777
quite a bit.

862
00:37:21,811 --> 00:37:23,445
Sam saved Sectionals last year

863
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,014
when we were short a member
and he moved back to McKinley.

864
00:37:26,049 --> 00:37:27,950
He rescued our Nationals trophy.

865
00:37:27,984 --> 00:37:29,952
And then he saved
Sectionals again this year

866
00:37:29,986 --> 00:37:31,787
when he found out
the Warblers cheated.

867
00:37:31,821 --> 00:37:34,823
Trouty Mouth inspired me
to try my hand at songwriting.

868
00:37:34,858 --> 00:37:36,658
Sam was the first person
in America

869
00:37:36,693 --> 00:37:38,327
to do a Sean Connery impression.

870
00:37:38,361 --> 00:37:42,631
♪ Grouper Mouth... ♪

871
00:37:42,665 --> 00:37:43,699
His impression is what made

872
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:45,000
Sean Connery's career
really take off.

873
00:37:45,034 --> 00:37:46,635
♪ Froggy Lips. ♪

874
00:37:46,669 --> 00:37:48,837
You know, Sam gave me
the courage to follow my dreams

875
00:37:48,872 --> 00:37:51,373
and become a singer,
and without him I probably

876
00:37:51,407 --> 00:37:52,741
would have never moved to L.A.

877
00:37:52,776 --> 00:37:54,476
And let's not forget
when Sam took care

878
00:37:54,511 --> 00:37:57,546
of his entire family
after his dad lost his job.

879
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:02,751
They were living in a motel,
homeless, and Sam supported them.

880
00:38:02,786 --> 00:38:04,153
I mean, that's pretty amazing.

881
00:38:04,187 --> 00:38:07,823
He's a really
substantial person.

882
00:38:07,857 --> 00:38:11,293
Now, that's... your essay.

883
00:38:15,598 --> 00:38:17,566
Thanks... thanks, bro.

884
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,701
Don't mention it.

885
00:38:24,893 --> 00:38:26,994
Hey, Artie.
Oh, I'm sorry, do I need

886
00:38:27,028 --> 00:38:28,295
to take my shirt off
while addressing you?

887
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:30,998
Listen, um, the bottom line is
that we have two empty months

888
00:38:31,032 --> 00:38:32,833
in this calendar.
We want you to fill them,

889
00:38:32,867 --> 00:38:33,834
and I-I totally understand,

890
00:38:33,868 --> 00:38:35,369
you know, wanting to
keep your shirt on.

891
00:38:35,403 --> 00:38:37,805
You want to be known for more
than just your massive biceps.

892
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:40,641
Look, it's hard enough
being the only one

893
00:38:40,675 --> 00:38:42,643
in a chair posing
for this calendar.

894
00:38:42,677 --> 00:38:45,045
I don't really want to be the
only one wearing clothes either.

895
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,980
You won't be.

896
00:39:12,707 --> 00:39:14,441
You have such broad shoulders.

897
00:39:14,476 --> 00:39:17,811
If you ever want to tap this,
seriously, just say the word.

898
00:39:21,049 --> 00:39:24,518
So, how much smut money
did you raise?

899
00:39:24,552 --> 00:39:26,186
About 350 bucks.

900
00:39:26,221 --> 00:39:28,856
Another 50 and we've covered
the bus to Regionals.

901
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:31,258
Well, you're a worthy
adversary, Finn Hudson,

902
00:39:31,292 --> 00:39:33,193
and that'll make you
all the more delicious

903
00:39:33,228 --> 00:39:37,064
when I've got you
slowly roasting on a spit,

904
00:39:37,098 --> 00:39:39,400
but, like, literally delicious.

905
00:39:42,604 --> 00:39:44,705
Hey, you don't have
to wait in line.

906
00:39:44,739 --> 00:39:46,907
I actually already
made one out for you.

907
00:39:46,941 --> 00:39:48,275
Thank you.

908
00:39:54,282 --> 00:39:56,283
I love you back.

909
00:40:02,524 --> 00:40:04,491
Ugh! Gross!

910
00:40:04,526 --> 00:40:07,060
Get a room!

911
00:40:07,095 --> 00:40:11,432
"My future wife, Becky Jackson."

912
00:40:11,466 --> 00:40:16,570
I wish you'd lose the shirt so
I can drool over that hot bod.

913
00:40:16,604 --> 00:40:18,972
Well, listen, I
think you both are hot,

914
00:40:19,007 --> 00:40:21,575
topless or not.
And do you know how I know?

915
00:40:21,609 --> 00:40:22,810
- 'Cause I'm a genius.
- You know what?

916
00:40:22,844 --> 00:40:24,244
I'm really excited
about this New Year.

917
00:40:24,279 --> 00:40:26,914

new year and a new me.
