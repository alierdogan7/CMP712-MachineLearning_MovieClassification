city of your choice‒ All aboard.

1477
01:41:58,195 --> 01:42:00,446
I'm a mess, huh?

1478
01:42:00,531 --> 01:42:03,574
You're fine.
[Train Whistle Blows]

1479
01:42:03,659 --> 01:42:08,496
[Man] All aboard.
Chicago, Denver and Los Angeles!

1480
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:14,252
I'm gonna get ya a bigger ring.
[Laughs]

1481
01:42:14,336 --> 01:42:17,922
All right.
So long, Billy.

1482
01:42:18,006 --> 01:42:20,508
[Man]
All aboard!

1483
01:42:23,804 --> 01:42:25,805
Billy!
Huh?

1484
01:42:25,889 --> 01:42:28,808
Don't go near the water.

1485
01:42:32,729 --> 01:42:35,148
[Chattering]

1486
01:42:35,232 --> 01:42:38,401
[Fanny] Norma,
I canceled the Baby Snooks rehearsal to come here?

1487
01:42:38,485 --> 01:42:41,487
[Norma]
Come on, Fanny.

1488
01:42:41,572 --> 01:42:44,866
What is this, a costume party?
I get paid for wearing costumes.

1489
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:46,868
Stop "quetching."
[Fanny] Kvetching.

1490
01:42:46,952 --> 01:42:49,495
Kvetching. Kvetching.
You're gonna just love it.

1491
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:51,789
We got seats right next to the field.
You're gonna love it.

1492
01:42:51,874 --> 01:42:54,625
Heigh-ho, Silverstein, right?
[Norma Chuckles] Right.

1493
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:57,295
Oh, Fanny.

1494
01:42:58,589 --> 01:43:01,507
[Fanny]
So this is Beverly Hills.

1495
01:43:03,051 --> 01:43:05,803
You can't catch up
with the goyim.

1496
01:43:05,888 --> 01:43:08,222
Just when you think you've
learned it all‒ grape scissors‒

1497
01:43:08,307 --> 01:43:10,558
they come at you with shooting sticks and "hukkas."

1498
01:43:10,642 --> 01:43:13,769
Chukkas. Chukkas.
Chukkas?

1499
01:43:13,854 --> 01:43:16,230
[Applause]

1500
01:43:16,315 --> 01:43:19,525
Oh, I wish
Billy was here.

1501
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:21,611
Billy loves baloney.

1502
01:43:43,675 --> 01:43:48,638
- [Man] Take it. - When Norma promises
you'll be excited, you'll be excited.

1503
01:43:52,059 --> 01:43:54,977
Do you know Nick?
Nick?

1504
01:43:55,062 --> 01:43:58,731
Oh, Fanny, you don't think
I planned anything, do you?

1505
01:43:58,815 --> 01:44:03,027
He just was here, and‒ Norma,
thank God you never had to learn to act.

1506
01:44:03,111 --> 01:44:05,029
[Exhales Forcefully]

1507
01:44:05,113 --> 01:44:08,157
What I want to know is,
does he know I'm here?

1508
01:44:08,242 --> 01:44:11,661
Well, I'm absolutely certain
he'd want to.

1509
01:44:16,166 --> 01:44:20,711
I'll see you kids later.
I'll send the car back. Enjoy the game.

1510
01:44:27,344 --> 01:44:30,930
Oh, come on. Quit while you're ahead.
Your finale is great.

1511
01:44:31,014 --> 01:44:34,475
Don't try to walk
on the water, kid.

1512
01:44:34,559 --> 01:44:39,272
Why don't you come on out here?
I'll send you a ticket. I'll send you a return ticket.

1513
01:44:39,356 --> 01:44:42,191
You want a private car?
I'll give my body to Huntington Hartford.

1514
01:44:42,276 --> 01:44:45,987
Come on. How about it?
What do you say?

1515
01:44:50,867 --> 01:44:53,452
No, no. I'm okay.

1516
01:44:53,537 --> 01:44:57,957
No. I really am.
I just miss you, kid, that's all.

1517
01:45:00,377 --> 01:45:04,213
Look, if I get too lonely,
I'll send for Fran, right?

1518
01:45:05,841 --> 01:45:08,092
Yeah. Sure.

1519
01:45:10,178 --> 01:45:14,515
No. Don't be silly.
Of course I understand.

1520
01:45:16,393 --> 01:45:20,896
I'll talk to you next week, huh?
Maybe sooner.

1521
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:24,358
Sure.

1522
01:45:26,570 --> 01:45:28,487
Me too.

1523
01:45:30,741 --> 01:45:34,577

01:48:45,727 --> 01:48:47,770
How are ya, kid?

1555
01:48:49,356 --> 01:48:53,651
I'm not sure.
A little nervous, I think.

1556
01:48:53,735 --> 01:48:56,862
Me too.
[Clears Throat]

1557
01:48:56,947 --> 01:49:00,533
Like always.
[Sighs]

1558
01:49:00,617 --> 01:49:04,620
You ever think about directing movies?
You already got the wardrobe.

1559
01:49:08,291 --> 01:49:12,628
- You look ravishing, old girl.
- You look ravishing too.

1560
01:49:15,173 --> 01:49:18,092
What's the matter?
You didn't have time to change out of your polo clothes?

1561
01:49:18,176 --> 01:49:23,931
Yes, I had plenty of time.
I tried to decide what I should wear.

1562
01:49:24,015 --> 01:49:28,561
And I looked in the mirror and saw
how becoming this outfit was.

1563
01:49:28,645 --> 01:49:33,065
So I just took a shower and put on more of the same.
I thought I might get by with it.

1564
01:49:33,149 --> 01:49:36,819
You picked up a new trick‒
telling the truth.

1565
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:56,422
What are you thinking?
[Sighs]

1566
01:49:57,674 --> 01:49:59,633
I was just remembering...

1567
01:50:02,846 --> 01:50:06,223
when I first
went out with you.

1568
01:50:06,308 --> 01:50:09,518
I was still living
home with Mama.

1569
01:50:09,603 --> 01:50:12,521
I used to sleep
in the same bed with her,

1570
01:50:12,606 --> 01:50:16,859
and once,
in the middle of the night,

1571
01:50:16,943 --> 01:50:19,862
I woke up kissing her.

1572
01:50:19,946 --> 01:50:22,865
And she woke up and said,
"This ain't Nick."

1573
01:50:24,534 --> 01:50:27,911
That's what I was thinking.

1574
01:50:33,501 --> 01:50:36,462
How is your mother?

1575
01:50:36,546 --> 01:50:40,090
She sold the saloons. She
lives in Lakewood, New Jersey.

1576
01:50:40,175 --> 01:50:42,718
She likes Billy.

1577
01:50:42,802 --> 01:50:45,554
Ah, yes. Mr. Rose.

1578
01:50:48,725 --> 01:50:50,684
How is Mr. Rose?

1579
01:50:52,145 --> 01:50:54,897
He keeps busy.

1580
01:50:54,981 --> 01:50:58,150
How about you? I mean,
when you come down off your horse?

1581
01:50:58,234 --> 01:51:01,153
Well, when I come down off my horse,
there's the yacht...

1582
01:51:01,237 --> 01:51:04,490
and a 13th-century palazzo,

1583
01:51:04,574 --> 01:51:08,869
which we're pulling apart stone by
stone and rebuilding in Cap d'Antibes.

1584
01:51:08,953 --> 01:51:13,666
- The problems of dismantling are just staggering.
- But I've always liked...

1585
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:17,252
- dismantling much better than "mantling."
- [Chuckles]

1586
01:51:17,337 --> 01:51:20,798
- Still the same old Fanny.
- You expecting Mrs. Roosevelt?

1587
01:51:20,882 --> 01:51:25,803
I was expecting Fanny.
Hoping for Fanny.

1588
01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:35,145
You know, Fanny,
the only trouble we had was money.

1589
01:51:35,230 --> 01:51:38,273
That's not a problem now.

1590
01:51:38,358 --> 01:51:41,276
No problem for you,
or no problem for your wife?

1591
01:51:42,821 --> 01:51:45,197
No problem for either of us.

1592
01:51:45,281 --> 01:51:48,367
If I walk away, I walk away
with a very large stake.

1593
01:51:56,835 --> 01:51:59,795
How you fixed
for toothbrushes, kid?

1594
01:52:03,842 --> 01:52:05,801
Oh, God.

1595
01:52:08,471 --> 01:52:12,599
I remember that first time
in Baltimore,

1596
01:52:15,061 --> 01:52:18,856
when I went up
to your hotel room.

1597
01:52:20,984 --> 01:52:24,027
And I went
into your bathroom.

1598
01:52:27,741 --> 01:52:30,951
Jesus. You
had seven toothbrushes.

1599
01:52:32,787 --> 01:52:36,582
Seven. I guess one
for every day in the week.

1600
01:52:36,666 --> 01:52:41,336
And you had this big wooden bowl with soap in it.

1601
01:52:42,756 --> 01:52:48,051
"By appointment to His Majesty,"
it says on the bowl.

1602
01:52:48,136 --> 01:52:51,305
Phew. Royal soap.

1603
01:52:51,389 --> 01:52:55,350
And hanging on the door
were these silk pajamas,

1604
01:52:55,435 --> 01:52:59,730
red, with a monogram,

1605
01:52:59,814 --> 01:53:02,983
real tiny, tiny.

1606
01:53:04,194 --> 01:53:06,403
That small.

1607
01:53:09,699 --> 01:53:13,202
Class. Phew.

1608
01:53:15,163 --> 01:53:18,874
Boy, did I come out of that bathroom with personality.
I mean‒

1609
01:53:21,377 --> 01:53:23,545
I was all over the place.

1610
01:53:27,091 --> 01:53:30,761
Because I fell in love
with those toothbrushes.

1611
01:53:50,573 --> 01:53:53,700
I still have
seven toothbrushes, Fanny.

1612
01:54:36,119 --> 01:54:39,079
And all these years...

1613
01:54:41,249 --> 01:54:44,209
I've been in love
with nothing but a set...

1614
01:54:44,294 --> 01:54:47,754
of goddamn toothbrushes.

1615
01:54:53,011 --> 01:54:56,722
You have a daughter,
you know.

1616
01:54:56,806 --> 01:55:00,434
You haven't seen her
in six years.

1617
01:55:00,518 --> 01:55:04,938
And you don't even think to ask about her.
You ask about Mama, Mr. Rose.

1618
01:55:05,023 --> 01:55:09,192
But you don't remember to inquire about
your own daughter, you son of a bitch.

1619
01:55:11,988 --> 01:55:14,907
[Sighs Nervously]
How is Fran?

1620
01:55:14,991 --> 01:55:18,869
She's great.
She keeps your picture next to her bed.

1621
01:55:20,705 --> 01:55:24,917
She does? Which one?
What do you care? They're all gorgeous.

1622
01:55:25,001 --> 01:55:29,338
Nick, the only trouble we had about money is
what you thought it could take the place of.

1623
01:55:29,422 --> 01:55:32,090
If you'll excuse me,
I have to go.

1624
01:55:32,175 --> 01:55:36,929
Bobby, say hi to Nick
before he goes.

1625
01:55:40,099 --> 01:55:43,602

Well, maybe not,
but you need me.

1810
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:14,759
You?
You I've had.

1811
02:12:17,721 --> 02:12:21,182
If you gotta get personal it's gonna
be a little south of complimentary,

1812
02:12:21,266 --> 02:12:24,185
but professionally,
I only helped you.

1813
02:12:24,269 --> 02:12:27,855
In the work department,
I was good for you, a good lift.

1814
02:12:29,524 --> 02:12:33,110
Come on. Let's
get together again, huh?

1815
02:12:35,697 --> 02:12:39,492
You know something?
My timing was always off for us.

1816
02:12:39,576 --> 02:12:42,787
It's too bad, really.
I just...

1817
02:12:42,871 --> 02:12:45,581
loused it all up.

1818
02:12:45,666 --> 02:12:49,043
Don't get such a swelled head.
I mean, you don't get all the credit.

1819
02:12:51,880 --> 02:12:55,299
What do you say? "Billy Rose presents Fanny Brice."
I don't like the billing.

1820
02:12:55,384 --> 02:12:57,593
All right.
I'll‒ I'll think it over and I'll call you.

1821
02:12:57,678 --> 02:13:01,722
You'll think it over?
That's what you're sayin'? "I'll think it over"?

1822
02:13:01,807 --> 02:13:05,059
Billy, I haven't done anything
without thinking in over ten years.

1823
02:13:07,145 --> 02:13:12,566
You wanna know the truth?
I was rattled as hell, you comin' here tonight.

1824
02:13:15,904 --> 02:13:19,407
I think what I wanted was for you to
come in here beggin' me to come back...

1825
02:13:19,491 --> 02:13:23,744
so I could have the pleasure of sayin' no.

1826
02:13:23,829 --> 02:13:27,164
It's taken me a long time
to learn how to say no.

1827
02:13:27,249 --> 02:13:30,793
I wanted a chance to practice.
That's what you're sayin' to me, no?

1828
02:13:30,877 --> 02:13:35,548
To me you're saying no? No.
I'm saying I'll think it over and call you.

1829
02:13:35,632 --> 02:13:38,843
Think fast. I don't wanna think fast.
That's the whole point.

1830
02:13:38,927 --> 02:13:41,679
No, the point is I'm at the Beverly Hills till noon,
day after tomorrow.

1831
02:13:41,763 --> 02:13:43,931
So yes or no,
no or yes, yes or no?

1832
02:13:44,016 --> 02:13:47,685
So I'll call you before noon day after tomorrow,
yes or no, no or yes, yes or no.

Make it yes. Rose and Brice.
Brice and Rose.

1836
02:14:09,041 --> 02:14:11,917
Rose and Brice.
Whatever.

1837
02:14:12,002 --> 02:14:16,380
We could
have a terrific time.

1838
02:14:28,727 --> 02:14:31,604
