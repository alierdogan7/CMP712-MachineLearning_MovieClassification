I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA HELP ME
BE A BIG BUSINESS WOMAN...

638
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:36,353
LIKE HELENA RUBENSTEIN
OR FANNIE FARMER.

I GAVE UP A WONDERFUL JOB.
HEAD CIGARETTE GIRL AT THE COPA.

645
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:58,876
I THOUGHT YOU HATED
ALL THOSE MEN STARING
AT YOU, MAKING ADVANCES.

646
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:01,879
WELL, IT'S NO DIFFERENT HERE
IN BIG BUSINESS.

647
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:05,883
AT LEAST AT THE COPA, WHEN I
GOT PINCHED, I GOT TIPPED.

648
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:10,387
AROUND HERE, A GIRL CAN'T EVEN
BEND DOWN TO PICK UP A PENCIL
WITH CONFIDENCE.

649

YOU MEAN SOMEBODY'S BEEN
BOTHERING YOU ?  WHO ?

WHO PINCHED YOU ?
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.

00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:24,902
YOU DID NOT KEEP YOUR PART
OF MY BARGAIN.
BUT DARLING, I MEANT EVERY WORD.

WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME ?
I'M WAITING
FOR THE ELEVATOR.

657
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:47,424
WHY DON'T YOU WALK DOWN ?
IT'S 30 FLOORS.

WHY DON'T YOU JUMP ?
[ Giggles ]
OH, J.B.

663
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:06,944
MOTHER JUST LOVES
HAVING DINNER WITH ME.

664
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:10,948
I TELL HER EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENS ALL DAY
AT THE OFFICE.

665
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:19,957

666
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:23,460
?? THE KID COULD REALLY
  PUT ME THROUGH HELL ??

667
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:27,464
?? AND SHE'S THINKING ??

668
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:30,467
?? THE KID COULD EVEN
  NAME THE HOTEL ??

669

00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:41,979
?? AND HE SAYS ??
IT'S A HOLDUP.

672
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:43,981
?? AND SHE SAYS ??

YOU'VE GOTTA SEE THIS.
THIS IS MY OLDER SISTER,
BERNICE.

680
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:19,516
THE ONE THAT GOT MARRIED
AT 17.  AND THAT'S SAM
AND THE SEVEN CHILDREN.

681
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:21,518
YES.  PRETTY.
SEVEN !

682
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:23,020
TOO MANY ?
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

683
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,022
NOT ENOUGH ?
NO, I DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING--

684
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:30,027
YOU DON'T LIKE CHILDREN.
ACTUALLY, I COME FROM A
RATHER LARGE FAMILY MYSELF.

685
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:32,029
I KNOW.  SIX.

686
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,532
HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT ?

687
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:39,536
SMITTY HAD YOUR PERSONNEL FILE
OUT, AND, UH, SHE WAS JUST
CHECKING OFF A FEW--

688

MAYBE WE BETTER ORDER.
HUH ?

689
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:44,541
MAYBE WE BETTER ORDER.

690
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:46,543
OKAY.

691
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:50,047
ACTUALLY, IT'S INCUMBENT
ON BIG CORPORATIONS TO FIND
BRIGHT, YOUNG MEN.

692
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:53,550
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT.
BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT,
BECAUSE ONCE--

693
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:56,053
HOW DO YOU LIKE
THOSE VEGETABLES ?
WELL, IT'S DELICIOUS.

694
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:59,056
I DO MY CARROTS IN A BOUILLON
WITH JUST A DOLLOP
OF WORCESTERSHIRE.

695
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:03,560
DOLLOP ?
JUST GREAT.  I WOULD REALLY
LOVE YOU TO HAVE IT SOMETIME.

696

WHAT WAS I TALKING ABOUT ?
BEFORE THE DOLLOP.

697
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:13,070
YOU TAKE THE AVERAGE YOUNG
PERSON TODAY.  THE TROUBLE
IS THEY'RE LOOKING FOR...

INSTANT POETRY,
INSTANT PSYCHOANALYSIS,
INSTANT MASHED POTATOES...

699
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:20,577
AND INSTANT
OLD-FASHIONED LOVE.

700
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:23,580
I MEAN, THEY DON'T REALIZE
THAT IT TAKES--

701
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,583
TAKES, UH, TIME TO ESTABLISH
A MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP.

702
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:31,088
DON'T YOU AGREE ?
WELL, NO.  I AGREE WITH
SOME OF THAT, ROSEMARY.

703
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:34,591
BUT IN THE WORLD OF BUSINESS,
I-- I SEE NO REASON...

704
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:39,596
WHY A PERSON HAS TO WAIT YEARS
TO BECOME A SUCCESS.

705
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:44,601
I DON'T KNOW.  IN THE WORLD
OF BUSINESS WHERE OLDER
AND MORE SOPHISTICATED--
