# I love Paris in the fall

00:05:44,807 --> 00:05:49,323
# I love Paris in the winter

00:05:49,407 --> 00:05:51,443
# When it drizzles

5
00:05:51,527 --> 00:05:56,043
# I love Paris in the summer

6
00:05:56,127 --> 00:05:58,357
# When it sizzles

7
00:05:58,447 --> 00:06:04,283
# I love Paris every moment

8
00:06:05,007 --> 00:06:11,401
# Every moment of the year

9
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:15,123
# I love Paris

10
00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:19,041
# Why, oh why do I love Paris?

11
00:06:19,127 --> 00:06:23,120
# Because my love is...

12
00:06:23,447 --> 00:06:25,915
# Near

13
00:06:33,247 --> 00:06:36,796
# Montmartre, Montmartre

14
00:06:36,887 --> 00:06:40,402
# Where the throngs and the songs continue

15
00:06:40,487 --> 00:06:43,797
# Montmartre, Montmartre

16
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:47,357
# Where Paris on a spree gets in you

17
00:06:47,447 --> 00:06:50,917
# Montmartre, Montmartre

18
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:54,522
# Where the quail never fail to win you

19
00:06:54,607 --> 00:06:58,156
- # Where they say, ''Oop-la!''
- # ''Where are you going, Papa?''

20
00:06:58,247 --> 00:07:00,886
# Montmartre, Montmartre

21
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:03,117
You'll never make it.

22
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,363
# Montmartre, Montmartre

23
00:07:10,447 --> 00:07:13,883
# Where the quail never fail to win you

00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:17,676

00:07:17,767 --> 00:07:21,362
# Montmartre, Montmartre

26
00:07:21,447 --> 00:07:23,802
# Montmartre

27
00:07:33,727 --> 00:07:35,479
Merci.

28
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,522
Cordon Rouge 1890, messieurs.

29
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:42,680
- Sounds potable. Thank you, Andre.
- Yes, an excellent year.

30
00:07:42,767 --> 00:07:45,042
1890.

31
00:07:45,127 --> 00:07:49,996
Let me see, there was...
Rachel and Marie... and Rachel again.

32
00:07:50,087 --> 00:07:51,839
That was a beautiful year.

33
00:07:51,927 --> 00:07:56,205
For me, 1882 was more memorable.

34
00:07:56,287 --> 00:07:58,198
That long ago?

35
00:07:58,287 --> 00:08:03,964
No, no. No, you don't. Other people might buy
your wistful retired-from-life act, but not me.

36
00:08:04,047 --> 00:08:06,800
I happen to know
about a certain lady on the Rue Avignon.

37
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:10,038
Well, one tries to stay amused.

38
00:08:10,127 --> 00:08:12,322
And one succeeds, no?

39
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:34,124
# We are maidens typical of France

40
00:08:34,207 --> 00:08:37,483
# In a convent educated

41
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:40,559
# From the wicked clutches of romance

42
00:08:41,127 --> 00:08:43,960
# We have all been segregated

43
00:08:44,447 --> 00:08:48,076
# We're all very pure
We wash our dainties white

44
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:51,398
# We all try to do exactly what is right

45
00:08:51,487 --> 00:08:53,159
# We all go to church

46
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,965
# We all say our prayers

47
00:08:55,047 --> 00:08:58,278
# And if, when we dance,
we show our derrieres

48
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:01,200
# It proves that, even when we dance

49
00:09:01,287 --> 00:09:05,917
# We are maidens typical of France

50
00:10:17,687 --> 00:10:19,962
Don't point. It's rude.

51
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:27,881
- Charming. That is Simone?
- No, no. That is Claudine.

52
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,926
I'm saving her for a rainy day.
But she is not Simone.

53
00:10:32,407 --> 00:10:36,366
This Simone, has she anything to do
with the surprise you promised me?

54
00:10:36,447 --> 00:10:39,723
- She certainly has.
- Good. I love surprises.

55
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:41,445
So does Simone.

56
00:10:41,527 --> 00:10:45,076
In fact, she'll hardly speak to me
if I show up without one.

57
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:46,919
Andre.

58
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,396
Simone. I'd know your perfume anywhere.

59
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:56,320
Francois! Diamonds!

60
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:58,762
- Well, some of them.
- Beautiful.

61
00:10:58,847 --> 00:11:01,407
Think she'll like it?
She's very particular, Fifi.

62
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:04,126
Fifi? Fifi-who-Fifi?!

63
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:06,482
You airways tease. Put it on.

64
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:09,764
Go on, hurry, put it on.
Then introduce me to your friend.

65
00:11:09,847 --> 00:11:13,442
No, no, no, take your time, Francois.
I'm in no hurry.

66
00:11:13,527 --> 00:11:15,404
AIIez-oop.

67
00:11:17,327 --> 00:11:21,081
Oh, Francois!
You'll never know how grateful I am.

68
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:22,885
Yes, I will.

69
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:27,961
Jewellery on my garter.
Makes me feel irresistible.

70
00:11:28,047 --> 00:11:31,926
Oh, mademoiselle,
resistance to you is unthinkable.

71
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:34,157
And un-French.

72
00:11:34,247 --> 00:11:36,761
It's a shame, though - no one will see it.

73
00:11:36,847 --> 00:11:38,997
I wish I could believe that.

74
00:11:39,087 --> 00:11:42,159
This is Monsieur Barriere,
this is Mademoiselle Simone.

75
00:11:42,247 --> 00:11:46,035
- Delighted, mademoiselle.
- I've heard so much about you.

76
00:11:46,127 --> 00:11:49,517
- Lies, all lies.
- No, no, nice things from Francois.

77
00:11:49,607 --> 00:11:52,121
Oh, but Francois is a gentleman.

78
00:11:52,207 --> 00:11:56,120
You know what I'm doing?
I'm sitting on diamonds.

79
00:11:56,207 --> 00:11:59,438
Imagine me sitting on diamonds.
It's quite a sensation.

80
00:11:59,527 --> 00:12:02,166
- Simone.
- Oh. This is bad?

81
00:12:02,247 --> 00:12:05,125
No, but it's not the sort of thing
done in royal circles.

82
00:12:05,927 --> 00:12:08,282
Say, what's holding up the you-know?

83
00:12:08,367 --> 00:12:10,801
The cancan. It'll be there in a minute.

84
00:12:10,887 --> 00:12:13,765
- The cancan?
- That was the surprise. She spoiled it.

85
00:12:13,847 --> 00:12:16,042
Now, now, now, wait a minute.

86
00:12:16,127 --> 00:12:20,598
The cancan is against the law.
You know that, Francois.

87
00:12:20,687 --> 00:12:24,839
- You mean you don't want to see it?
- Of course I do. Who doesn't?

88
00:12:24,927 --> 00:12:29,717
But a man in my position, if it becomes
known that I watched the cancan...

89
00:12:29,807 --> 00:12:34,961
What does the law call it?
''A lewd and lascivious performance.''

90
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:38,119
What could I say?
How could I defend myself?

91
00:12:38,207 --> 00:12:40,641
You needn't worry.
No one will ever know.

92
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:44,083
- But suppose the police arrive?
- The police will not arrive.

93
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:48,285
- Do you think I'd have you caught in a raid?
- Francois has taken care of the police.

94
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:51,837
Believe me, I cannot afford
to have this place of mine closed.

95
00:12:51,927 --> 00:12:54,999
- You are sure?
- I am 2,000-francs-worth sure.

96
00:12:55,087 --> 00:13:00,115
Well, I cannot approve officially, but...

97
00:13:00,207 --> 00:13:02,198
What are we waiting for?

98
00:13:02,287 --> 00:13:03,436
Good.

99
00:14:19,727 --> 00:14:22,366
See? I told you,
they never arrest the waiters.

100
00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:25,325
Francois, this could have been very bad.

101
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:27,125
I don't understand it.

102
00:14:27,207 --> 00:14:28,401
Ow!

103
00:14:28,487 --> 00:14:29,602
Simone!

104
00:14:29,687 --> 00:14:33,157
I will bite you again and again!
You told me everything was arranged!

105
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:37,877
- It was arranged!
- Then someone must have re-arranged it.

106
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:44,645
The Police Correctional Court
is now in session.

107
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:51,519
It wpll be noted for the record
that today Judge Merceaux and myself

108
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:57,682
wpll be joined by a colleague transferred
to this court from the 14th arrondissement.

109
00:14:57,767 --> 00:15:03,160
I am most pleased to welcome
Judge Forrestier to our judicial family.

110
00:15:03,687 --> 00:15:09,478
Thank you. It is a privilege to become
a member of such a distinguished family.

111
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:14,156
First case. Bring in the accused.

112
00:15:23,127 --> 00:15:24,685
Order!

113
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:29,921
- The accused wpll remember where they are.
- Who could forget?

114
00:15:32,647 --> 00:15:35,115
Where is the attorney for the defence?

115
00:15:35,207 --> 00:15:37,960
I'm coming, Your Honour.

116
00:15:38,047 --> 00:15:39,924
You are late.

117
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:46,637
I am sorry, Monsieur le President. I spent
the night in... consultation with a client.

118
00:15:46,727 --> 00:15:48,957
Let us proceed with the charges.

119
00:15:49,047 --> 00:15:54,167
The prisoners are charged with violation
of the Pubic Morals Law of 1790,

120
00:15:54,247 --> 00:16:00,083
in that they did wilfully perform
a lewd and lascivious dance

121
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:07,005
calculated to inflame the minds, souls
and moral fibres of the spectators.

122
00:16:07,087 --> 00:16:09,157
We did?

123
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:11,605
Gudge bangs gavel)

124
00:16:12,767 --> 00:16:15,759
May I ask who filed this complaint?

125
00:16:16,447 --> 00:16:22,158
We did, Monsieur le President. We represent
the League Against Filthy Dancing.

126
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:26,525
Are you aware that all complaints
must be signed by an official of the court?

127
00:16:26,607 --> 00:16:28,962
It was signed, Monsieur le President.

128
00:16:29,047 --> 00:16:31,117
It was? By whom?

129
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:33,801
- By me, Your Honour.
- By you?

130
00:16:33,887 --> 00:16:38,403
Why, yes. It was a complaint
brought by responsible citizens.

131
00:16:38,487 --> 00:16:39,966
Oh.

132
00:16:41,447 --> 00:16:44,678
And this is the complaint that you signed?

133
00:16:47,447 --> 00:16:49,403
Yes, it is.

134
00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:56,557
Well then, since the complaint is in order,
we will proceed with the trial.

135
00:16:56,647 --> 00:17:01,846
- Where is the prosecuting attorney?
- He is ill, Your Honour. Confined to his home.

136
00:17:01,927 --> 00:17:04,725
That's true.
I saw him an hour ago - he's gravely ill.

137
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:08,959
Oh, I'm terribly sorry to hear it.
Are there any witnesses?

138
00:17:09,047 --> 00:17:10,480
No, Your Honour.

139
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:15,800
Your Honour, since the prosecutor's absent
and there are no witnesses to the said dance,

140
00:17:15,887 --> 00:17:18,162
I propose a dismissal.

141
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:23,799
One moment, Your Honour, please.
Where are the officers who made this arrest?

142
00:17:24,807 --> 00:17:27,401
Summon the arresting officers.

143
00:17:27,487 --> 00:17:30,923
- There are only two of them present.
- Where are the others?

144
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:34,966
Your Honour, this is not a very important
case, so we didn't think...

145
00:17:35,047 --> 00:17:38,517
Since when do the poIice
decide which cases are important?

146
00:17:38,607 --> 00:17:40,837
But...

147
00:17:42,247 --> 00:17:45,523
When you made the arrest
did you see any of the dancing?

148
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:48,804
No, monsieur.
I was outside, guarding the exit.

149
00:17:48,887 --> 00:17:51,799
- And you? Were you inside?
- Oui, monsieur.

150
00:17:51,887 --> 00:17:55,436
- Then you saw the dancing?
- I object.

151
00:17:55,527 --> 00:17:58,758
With all due respect,
he is presupposing a fact.

152
00:17:59,247 --> 00:18:02,398
- Objection sustained.
- I shall rephrase the question.

153
00:18:02,487 --> 00:18:05,365
- Did you see the dancing?
- Non, monsieur.

154
00:18:05,447 --> 00:18:07,358
Why not? You admit you were there.

155
00:18:07,447 --> 00:18:12,043
But I have trouble with my eyes.
I suffer with an ailment. It is called...

156
00:18:12,127 --> 00:18:15,676
- Perjury, maybe?
- Just a moment.

157
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:19,999
I object to that as being
an unjust and irresponsible accusation.

158
00:18:20,087 --> 00:18:22,555
Your Honour, I know this good man,

159
00:18:22,647 --> 00:18:26,242
and I happen to know he suffers
from a severe case of astigmatism.

160
00:18:26,327 --> 00:18:28,318
Yes, astigatism, yes.

161
00:18:29,447 --> 00:18:30,596
Sustained.

162
00:18:30,687 --> 00:18:34,680
When you made the arrest surely
you took down testimony from witnesses?

163
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:40,046
Your Honour, did you ever try to take down
testimony while arresting a cancan dancer?

164
00:18:40,127 --> 00:18:44,643
Now, really. I suppose you also failed
to collect any witnesses' names?

165
00:18:44,727 --> 00:18:49,323
Yes, Your Honour.
Because in the struggle I lost my pencil.

166
00:18:49,407 --> 00:18:54,401
This is astounding. Obviously not one of you
is performing his duties properly,

167
00:18:54,487 --> 00:18:57,365
or you'd offer
some kind of evidence for a conviction.

168
00:18:57,447 --> 00:19:02,077
Since it is the learned magistrate's opinion
that there is no evidence for a conviction,

169
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:04,601
I move that the case be dismissed.

170
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:07,724
- Any objection?
- No objection.

171
00:19:07,807 --> 00:19:10,037
Judge Forrestier?

172
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:12,721
Well, Your Honour, under the circumstances...

173
00:19:12,807 --> 00:19:14,479
Case dismissed. Recess.

174
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:24,440
All right, girls, come on...

175
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,566
Very good.

176
00:19:29,887 --> 00:19:30,876
Very good.

177
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:34,164
Mademoiselle, perhaps a little closer to...

178
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,680
- But by all means, monsieur.
- No, no, no, no.

179
00:19:37,767 --> 00:19:41,123
We were asked to do this for the newspapers,
not for postcards.

180
00:19:41,207 --> 00:19:42,925
HoId it.

181
00:19:43,407 --> 00:19:44,522
Arh!

182
00:19:44,607 --> 00:19:48,441
- Where'd everybody go?
- No, no, no! You wiggle, all of you!

183
00:19:48,527 --> 00:19:51,041
You wpll have to hold still.

184
00:19:54,047 --> 00:19:56,322
Ah, Judge Forrestier. Hello.

185
00:19:56,407 --> 00:19:59,240
My friend the defence lawyer.
What a pleasant surprise.

186
00:19:59,327 --> 00:20:02,478
- I planned to visit you in your chambers.
- A business matter?

187
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:05,559
No, to get acquainted with the new judge.
I'm a friendly type.

188
00:20:05,647 --> 00:20:09,083
And you like to have friends at court,
so to speak?

189
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:13,240
It's a little early, but my clients and I
were celebrating. Won't you join us?

190
00:20:13,327 --> 00:20:14,999
I'd rather not, if you don't mind.

191
00:20:15,087 --> 00:20:18,079
- But they're such lovely clients.
- Yes, they are indeed.

192
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:23,287
And they don't hold this morning against you.
They like you very much. Don't you, ladies?

193
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:24,846
- CertainIy.
- Not me.

194
00:20:24,927 --> 00:20:27,157
You see? They love you.

195
00:20:27,247 --> 00:20:31,638
We may never get along, you and I, but
we certainly won't if you take me for a fool.

196
00:20:31,727 --> 00:20:35,925
- I take people as I find them.
- Yes, I know you do. I've met your type.

197
00:20:36,007 --> 00:20:39,363
Nothing matters but having a good time.
I know you very well.

198
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:42,439
When I think of the things you're missing -
the wonderful...

199
00:20:42,527 --> 00:20:46,839
Oh, yes, wonderful, wonderful.
Wine from a lady's slipper.

200
00:20:46,927 --> 00:20:51,205
Dawn in a strange bed.
Intoxicating intrigue. Romance.

201
00:20:51,287 --> 00:20:55,485
Romance in gay Paris.
Spare me the rest of the cliches, wpll you?

202
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:59,321
I never thought I'd hear a Frenchman say
things are more important than romance.

203
00:20:59,407 --> 00:21:02,797
Unfortunately, some things
are more important.

204
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:06,800
How can you ignore love when
so many of your countrymen have died for it?

205
00:21:06,887 --> 00:21:09,401
As you know, duelling is against the law.

206
00:21:09,487 --> 00:21:11,523
That's true. But...

207
00:21:11,607 --> 00:21:14,519
# The law must be tempered with reason

208
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:18,680
# Not to love should be considered treason

209
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:20,120
Nonsense.

210
00:21:20,207 --> 00:21:23,916
# When love comes in

211
00:21:24,007 --> 00:21:27,158
# And takes you for a spin

212
00:21:27,247 --> 00:21:30,125
# Ooh-la-la-la

213
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:33,085
# C'est magnifique

214
00:21:34,487 --> 00:21:37,843
# When every night

215
00:21:37,927 --> 00:21:40,646
# Your loved one holds you tight

216
00:21:40,727 --> 00:21:44,242
# Ooh-la-la-la

217
00:21:44,327 --> 00:21:47,125
# C'est magnifique

218
00:21:48,287 --> 00:21:51,245
# But when one day

219
00:21:51,327 --> 00:21:54,558
# Your loved one drifts away

220
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,480
# Ooh-la-la-la

221
00:21:57,567 --> 00:22:01,082
# It is so tragique

222
00:22:02,047 --> 00:22:05,119
# But when once more

223
00:22:05,207 --> 00:22:08,882
# She whispers, ''Je t'adore''

224
00:22:08,967 --> 00:22:14,041
# C'est magnifique

225
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:20,603
# But when one day

226
00:22:20,687 --> 00:22:24,043
# Your loved one drifts away

227
00:22:24,127 --> 00:22:27,517
# Ooh-la-la-la

228
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:34,082
# It is so tragique

229
00:22:36,127 --> 00:22:40,757
# But when once more

230
00:22:40,847 --> 00:22:43,566
# She whispers...

231
00:22:43,647 --> 00:22:45,319
# Je t'adore

232
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:47,363
# Formid'

233
00:22:47,447 --> 00:22:48,880
# Je t'aime

234
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,276
# Sensas

235
00:22:51,367 --> 00:22:52,959
# Mon amour

236
00:22:53,047 --> 00:22:55,766
# Ring-a-ding-ding-ding

237
00:22:55,847 --> 00:23:03,083
# C'est magnifique

238
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,800
Ah, that was a good one!

239
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,606
Very... very instructive.

240
00:23:10,687 --> 00:23:14,805
Ladies, you are now immortal.
We must go now. Come, come.

241
00:23:17,087 --> 00:23:20,045
- Your Honour, I bid you good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

242
00:23:20,127 --> 00:23:24,723
Oh, I have one question. If you plan on being
a monk, why don't you shave your head?

243
00:23:24,807 --> 00:23:29,039
And if you want to be what you want to be,
why bother to be a lawyer?

244
00:23:29,127 --> 00:23:33,200
Has anyone ever told you that ajudge
needn't be ajudge 24 hours a day?

245
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:37,439
- Good afternoon, monsieur.
- Afternoon, Jacques. Keep your lens clean.

246
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:56,517
- Evening, Your Honour.
- Is the wagon here?

247
00:23:56,607 --> 00:23:59,246
- Yes, monsieur. Back out of the way.
- Fine.

248
00:23:59,327 --> 00:24:02,239
We wpll enter separately.
You wpll sit with him.

249
00:24:02,327 --> 00:24:07,845
When you see me remove this flower from my
IapeI and drop it, take the picture. All right?

250
00:24:07,927 --> 00:24:08,837
Yes, sir.

251
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:12,317
As soon as the flash goes off,
that's your signal to start the raid.

252
00:24:12,407 --> 00:24:15,717
- Understood, sir.
- We will be ready, sir.

253
00:24:17,127 --> 00:24:22,247
Table six. Never saw him before.
Couldl be a detective.

254
00:24:25,887 --> 00:24:28,082
ShaII I throw him out?

255
00:24:29,047 --> 00:24:31,607
No. He might be a real customer.

256
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:33,757
- You stay close. I will go see.
- Mm-hm.

257
00:24:37,607 --> 00:24:39,199
- Good evening.
- Hello.

258
00:24:39,287 --> 00:24:42,836
- You'd like to buy me a drink?
- By all means.

259
00:24:42,927 --> 00:24:47,079
- My name is Simone.
- Mine is Marcel. Marcel Ayonais.

260
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:49,761
- You've not been here before, no?
- To my regret.

261
00:24:49,847 --> 00:24:52,156
- What wpll you have?
- Champagne?

262
00:24:52,247 --> 00:24:55,683
- Perrier-Jouet 1887.
- Yes, monsieur.

263
00:24:57,647 --> 00:24:59,319
You must be very rich, no?

264
00:24:59,407 --> 00:25:04,686
As Chateaubriand said, the state rests
upon the acquiescence of the poor.

265
00:25:04,767 --> 00:25:07,440
That settles that -
you're certainly no detective.

266
00:25:07,527 --> 00:25:09,245
Were you expecting one?

267
00:25:09,327 --> 00:25:12,717
When one runs an establishment
such as this, one has to be careful.

268
00:25:12,807 --> 00:25:15,275
- I can imagine.
- What do you mean?

269
00:25:15,367 --> 00:25:18,040
Only that detectives are like everyone else -

270
00:25:18,127 --> 00:25:22,006
always trying to take advantage
of a poor vulnerable girl.

271
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:25,397
It's the truth. You have no idea
what I go through here. Smoke?

272
00:25:25,487 --> 00:25:26,886
No, thank you.

273
00:25:26,967 --> 00:25:29,561
- You mind if I do?
- No.

274
00:25:29,647 --> 00:25:32,320
- Does it shock you?
- Not at all.

275
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:36,082
But isn't it bad for the lungs?

276
00:25:37,887 --> 00:25:40,526
What do you think?

277
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:46,318
In my profession, I never give an opinion
without examining the evidence.

278
00:25:46,407 --> 00:25:49,001
- What is your profession?
- Wine taster.

279
00:25:49,087 --> 00:25:50,839
- Bordeaux?
- No, Limoges.

280
00:25:50,927 --> 00:25:52,918
- Limoges?!
- Don't make a face.

281
00:25:53,007 --> 00:25:55,646
Everyone can't be born in Paris.

282
00:25:55,727 --> 00:25:57,365
I like you.

283
00:25:57,447 --> 00:25:59,881
You could not afford
not to like your customers.

284
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:02,197
I'm a businesswoman,
but not at this moment.

285
00:26:02,287 --> 00:26:04,596
Then maybe you will do me a favour.

286
00:26:04,687 --> 00:26:08,646
- I just became a businesswoman again.
- This is a business favour.

287
00:26:08,727 --> 00:26:12,117
I was told I might see the cancan here -
the real cancan.

288
00:26:12,207 --> 00:26:13,845
Is that true?

289
00:26:13,927 --> 00:26:16,077
If not, I will try somewhere else.

290
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:19,045
You see, I have only this one night in Paris.

291
00:26:23,247 --> 00:26:26,478
- You will see it.
- Oh, I don't believe you.

292
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:29,877
- Why not, you don't believe me?
- You could not get away with it.

293
00:26:29,967 --> 00:26:34,085
This place doesn't make enough money
to bribe all the policemen in Paris.

294
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:36,635
Foolish man! It doesn't take money.

295
00:26:36,727 --> 00:26:38,445
- Really?
- No, of course not.

296
00:26:38,527 --> 00:26:42,042
The district chief is mad for Helene -
she's one of my girls.

297
00:26:42,127 --> 00:26:45,164
You will find the brigadier
around Genevieve's little finger.

298
00:26:45,247 --> 00:26:50,082
True, sometimes we must pay money,
but more often than not... a kiss, a little wine.

299
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:52,203
- It's that simple?
- Simple?

300
00:26:52,287 --> 00:26:56,917
It takes much organisation to find out who
wants which from whom and who wants who.

301
00:26:57,007 --> 00:26:59,123
Then as soon as I get my list competed,

302
00:26:59,207 --> 00:27:04,235
some stinker switches
the whole brigade to another precinct.

303
00:27:04,327 --> 00:27:06,841
I'm from Limoges.

304
00:27:06,927 --> 00:27:07,916
So?

305
00:27:08,007 --> 00:27:13,604
A list of what it takes to bribe every gendarme
in the district - no one could have such a list.

306
00:27:13,687 --> 00:27:16,997
I'm from Limoges,
but that doesn't make me a tourist.

307
00:27:17,087 --> 00:27:20,636
You sound like
you'd like to make a little wager.

308
00:27:20,727 --> 00:27:24,686
- 1,000 francs.
- 1,000 francs?!

309
00:27:25,927 --> 00:27:28,202
It's perfectly all right. I will...

310
00:27:31,247 --> 00:27:33,238
What...

311
00:32:07,807 --> 00:32:12,164
- Do you do this every night?
- No, no, no. We're closed on Sundays.

312
00:32:12,247 --> 00:32:16,843
Why are you in Montmartre? You're good
enough for Les Ambassadeurs or Maxim's.

313
00:32:16,927 --> 00:32:19,157
- You been to those places?
- Of course not.

314
00:32:19,247 --> 00:32:22,159
- About this 1,000 francs now...
- Hm? Yes?

315
00:32:22,247 --> 00:32:24,636
Still want to make a little bet?

316
00:32:25,647 --> 00:32:27,638
Show me the list and it's yours.

317
00:32:27,727 --> 00:32:31,640
For 1,000 francs, I'd show you anything!
Well, almost anything.

318
00:32:31,727 --> 00:32:33,240
Come with me.

319
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:35,921
I will get it. This way.

320
00:32:44,247 --> 00:32:47,683
- The judge!
- It is!

321
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:50,125
Come in.

322
00:32:50,207 --> 00:32:55,440
This is my boudoir. It's also my office.
I do most of my work here.

323
00:32:56,407 --> 00:33:01,435
No one knows how to open this safe but me,
and I always forget the combination.

324
00:33:01,527 --> 00:33:04,200
Why don't you write it down
on a piece of paper?

325
00:33:04,287 --> 00:33:06,676
I tried that once.
But where would I hide it?

326
00:33:06,767 --> 00:33:11,841
I put it in between... down here,
but somehow it got into unfriendly hands.

327
00:33:11,927 --> 00:33:17,047
Well, then put it under your mattress.
It ought to be safe there.

328
00:33:19,527 --> 00:33:21,279
I knew I liked you.

329
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:23,642
- Mademoiselle Simone.
- Yes, Andre?

330
00:33:23,727 --> 00:33:26,924
Pardon me, monsieur.
I must speak to you immediately.

331
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:28,963
- One moment.
- No, immediately.

332
00:33:29,047 --> 00:33:31,436
I said one moment.
I'm about to win 1,000 francs.

333
00:33:31,527 --> 00:33:34,758
- Mademoiselle...
- There, that's got it.

334
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:38,044
- What are you doing?
- You must come with me right now.

335
00:33:38,127 --> 00:33:41,119
- Andre, are you crazy?
- It is of vital importance.

336
00:33:41,207 --> 00:33:46,076
- What'd you do that for?
- You don't want to leave it open, I'm sure.

337
00:33:47,887 --> 00:33:52,403
All right, if it's that important.
Pardon me one moment.

338
00:33:53,887 --> 00:33:55,445
Simone...

339
00:33:55,527 --> 00:33:57,961
- What is it?
- Do you know who you've got in there?

340
00:33:58,047 --> 00:34:00,607
A gentleman from Limoges.
He made me a wager.

341
00:34:00,687 --> 00:34:06,000
No! That's Judge Forrestier, the man
who signed the complaint against us.

342
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:09,079
- That's ridiculous. It can't be.
- But it is.

343
00:34:09,167 --> 00:34:12,000
- There is no doubt.
- What's he been saying to you?

344
00:34:12,087 --> 00:34:17,161
He just made me a little wager
that I didn't have a list of the gendarmes...

345
00:34:18,447 --> 00:34:19,800
Oh.

346
00:34:20,607 --> 00:34:22,916
Oh, he's a clever one!

347
00:34:24,847 --> 00:34:28,203
Andre, you'd better tell them
to hold the cancan.

348
00:34:28,287 --> 00:34:30,323
What are you going to do?

349
00:34:30,407 --> 00:34:33,444
Work on him.
Work on him. What else?

350
00:34:36,847 --> 00:34:38,997
I hope it wasn't bad news.

351
00:34:39,887 --> 00:34:42,799
No. Not really.

352
00:34:42,887 --> 00:34:44,878
I should've expected it.

353
00:34:44,967 --> 00:34:47,765
- Can I help in any way?
- Oh, no, thank you.

354
00:34:47,847 --> 00:34:50,566
It's too late now.
Thank you just the same.

355
00:34:50,647 --> 00:34:54,879
You don't want to settle the bet?
I'd like to see that mythical list of yours.

356
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:57,037
Let's forget about the list tonight.

357
00:34:57,127 --> 00:35:02,042
Besides, the news I just heard has driven
the combination right out of my head.

358
00:35:02,127 --> 00:35:05,119
It must have been very distracting news.

359
00:35:05,967 --> 00:35:08,197
That's putting it midly.

360
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:11,562
What are you staring at?

361
00:35:11,647 --> 00:35:14,161
Why don't you sit down and have a drink?

362
00:35:14,247 --> 00:35:19,002
There's not much point
in my staying any longer, is there?

363
00:35:21,247 --> 00:35:25,399
Do you mean to say
all you care about is my list?

364
00:35:25,487 --> 00:35:27,523
That's not very flattering.

365
00:35:27,607 --> 00:35:29,916
With a face like that, you should not.

366
00:35:30,007 --> 00:35:32,567
- What's the matter with my face?
- It's a mirror.

367
00:35:32,647 --> 00:35:36,162
It betrays every thought
that goes on behind it.

368
00:35:36,247 --> 00:35:40,604
I was just thinking I should get out
of these silly clothes. Will you wait?

369
00:35:40,687 --> 00:35:43,201
Are you sure you want me to?

370
00:35:44,487 --> 00:35:49,038
But of course.
We're just beginning to know each other.

371
00:35:50,807 --> 00:35:56,325
It's draughty in here. Do you think
you'd be able to close my window?

372
00:35:59,847 --> 00:36:01,678
Certainly.

373
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,358
Good.

374
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:19,880
It's funny, I've never met a man
who could close that window.

375
00:36:19,967 --> 00:36:25,166
I don't know why it seems so important to me.
I even dream about it sometimes.

376
00:36:25,247 --> 00:36:30,765
- Why don't you get a carpenter?
- I don't think I'd be happy with a carpenter.

377
00:36:31,927 --> 00:36:33,201
Simone?

378
00:36:33,287 --> 00:36:37,166
- Oh, excuse me.
- It's all right. She's in there.

379
00:36:42,687 --> 00:36:46,805
- Who was that?
- I think a musician. I don't know.

380
00:36:46,887 --> 00:36:49,959
It doesn't matter.
How are you doing with that window?

381
00:36:50,047 --> 00:36:53,357
- You still need a carpenter.
- I thought so.

382
00:36:57,607 --> 00:37:00,519
- You like it?
- Very becoming.

383
00:37:04,647 --> 00:37:07,161
Can you do up my back?

384
00:37:07,247 --> 00:37:09,477
Certainly.

385
00:37:14,007 --> 00:37:16,521
- Something bothering you?
- No.

386
00:37:16,607 --> 00:37:18,882
Why? Are my hands coId?

387
00:37:19,887 --> 00:37:21,525
A little.

388
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:24,644
I'm sorry if they feel unpleasant.

389
00:37:24,727 --> 00:37:26,843
I didn't say that.

390
00:37:28,007 --> 00:37:33,001
Simone, you know who I am,
and I know that you know.

391
00:37:33,087 --> 00:37:36,284
Now, you're a nice, hard-working girl
with a bright head.

392
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:40,679
Why do you insist on fighting the authorities?
You're not equipped to fight them.

393
00:37:40,767 --> 00:37:45,636
You almost let a total stranger trick you
into giving up a vital piece of evidence.

394
00:37:45,727 --> 00:37:48,400
A girl that naive
has no chance against the police.

395
00:37:48,487 --> 00:37:51,126
I don't care. I think it's a stupid law.

396
00:37:51,207 --> 00:37:53,846
What harm can a simple little folk dance...

397
00:37:53,927 --> 00:37:55,565
- Folk dance?!
- Yes!

398
00:37:55,647 --> 00:37:59,799
- It can close your cafe and put you in jaiI.
- Only because of people like you.

399
00:37:59,887 --> 00:38:04,483
Why do you come in here and sneak around
like some detective? It's not your business.

400
00:38:04,567 --> 00:38:08,924
- Bribed policemen are my business.
- Then go arrest them and leave me alone.

401
00:38:09,007 --> 00:38:11,077
Simone. Simone, you're silly.

402
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:17,402
The people like the cancan. They come here
and expect to see it, so I give it to them.

403
00:38:17,487 --> 00:38:19,921
What are you doing?

404
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:22,077
Feeling sorry for you.

405
00:38:40,007 --> 00:38:42,760
Forgive me. I... I don't know why I did that.

406
00:38:43,847 --> 00:38:47,123
You could not help it. Could you?

407
00:38:48,447 --> 00:38:51,996
# When love comes in

408
00:38:52,087 --> 00:38:55,318
# And takes you for a spin

409
00:38:56,007 --> 00:38:58,999
# Ooh-la-la-la

410
00:38:59,607 --> 00:39:01,837
# C'est magnifique

411
00:39:01,927 --> 00:39:03,883
No, no, please, not again.

412
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:10,202
# When every night
your loved one holds you tight

413
00:39:10,287 --> 00:39:13,677
# Ooh-la-la-la

414
00:39:13,767 --> 00:39:16,486
# C'est magnifique

415
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:19,001
Why must I be bombarded by this song?

416
00:39:19,087 --> 00:39:22,523
# But when one day

417
00:39:22,607 --> 00:39:26,202
# Your loved one drifts away

418
00:39:26,287 --> 00:39:27,925
# Ooh-la-la-la

419
00:39:28,007 --> 00:39:30,157
- C'est magnifique?
- No.

420
00:39:30,247 --> 00:39:34,081
# It is so tragique

421
00:39:34,727 --> 00:39:38,640
# But when once more

422
00:39:38,727 --> 00:39:41,082
# He whispers...

423
00:39:41,167 --> 00:39:43,635
# ''Je t'adore''

424
00:39:43,727 --> 00:39:48,721
# C'est magnifique

425
00:39:57,887 --> 00:40:00,526
Do you still want to arrest me?

426
00:40:01,407 --> 00:40:04,399
I never did. And now less than ever.

427
00:40:05,407 --> 00:40:08,399
What would you like to do with me?

428
00:40:08,487 --> 00:40:10,364
I haven't decided.

429
00:40:10,447 --> 00:40:12,677
I think you have.

430
00:40:12,767 --> 00:40:15,076
Perhaps you're right.

431
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:20,476
- If only I could trust you.
- Trust me how?

432
00:40:20,567 --> 00:40:22,558
Not to hurt me.

433
00:40:23,927 --> 00:40:28,398
As long as I have a choice,
I would never hurt you.

434
00:40:28,487 --> 00:40:31,001
- Mademoiselle?
- Yes, Andre?

435
00:40:31,087 --> 00:40:33,760
May I see you for a moment?

436
00:40:34,607 --> 00:40:37,201
Oh, I'm a businesswoman again.

437
00:40:38,007 --> 00:40:40,840
If you wait downstairs,
I will join you there in one minute.

438
00:40:40,927 --> 00:40:46,126
- Please do. We have much to taIk about.
- I will hang on every word.

439
00:40:50,087 --> 00:40:52,476
- Well?
- My first judge.

440
00:40:52,567 --> 00:40:55,400
The girls are all ready.
Shall I cancel the dance?

441
00:40:55,487 --> 00:40:59,446
No, of course not. From now on
we have nothing to worry about.

442
00:40:59,527 --> 00:41:01,165
Good, good.

443
00:41:01,247 --> 00:41:04,319
Arturo's waiting for instructions.

444
00:42:00,007 --> 00:42:02,521
- Thank you, jailer.
- Sir.

445
00:42:07,447 --> 00:42:10,200
You look like a broken umbrella.

446
00:42:11,287 --> 00:42:15,075
Oh, come, come.
I'm your lawyer. You can talk to me.

447
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,964
Where have you been?

448
00:42:17,047 --> 00:42:20,403
Now, now. I've brought bail.
I will have you out of here in ten minutes.

449
00:42:20,487 --> 00:42:24,196
12 hours! 12 hours you let me sit here!

450
00:42:24,287 --> 00:42:27,518
Where were you at 4am?
I sent a messenger to your apartment.

451
00:42:27,607 --> 00:42:31,441
I was there all the time. I didn't hear a thing.
You know I'm a sound sleeper.

452
00:42:31,527 --> 00:42:33,882
You were with some silly little model?

453
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:37,516
You know, you are a lousy lawyer
and an unreliable lover.

454
00:42:37,607 --> 00:42:42,556
I am not a lousy lawyer.
But I do have an idiot for a client.

455
00:42:42,647 --> 00:42:46,322
Putting on an illegal performance
before a police-courtjudge

456
00:42:46,407 --> 00:42:49,444
who's sitting there roosting
right at a ringside table.

457
00:42:49,527 --> 00:42:52,564
And you knew he was ajudge
because Claudine told you he was.

458
00:42:52,647 --> 00:42:56,322
- Well, he lied to me.
- So what? You've known liars before.

459
00:42:56,407 --> 00:43:00,878
What made you so gullible all of a sudden?
His big brown eyes?

460
00:43:00,967 --> 00:43:03,003
Well, I...

461
00:43:03,087 --> 00:43:05,681
I believed him because I thought he liked me.

462
00:43:05,767 --> 00:43:09,646
Oh, you did? So that's what's
been going on behind my back.

463
00:43:09,727 --> 00:43:13,117
Oh, it was business! I hate him!
It was business.

464
00:43:13,207 --> 00:43:15,163
Shrewd business.

465
00:43:15,247 --> 00:43:19,240
May cost you 10,000 francs.
Plus losing your licence for about two weeks.

466
00:43:19,327 --> 00:43:21,204
10,000?!

467
00:43:21,287 --> 00:43:25,166
That's pretty expensive goo-goo eyes
you've been roiling.

468
00:43:25,247 --> 00:43:28,922
- Ah. You're letting her out?
- Judge Forrestier wants her brought to him.

469
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:33,637
- Who cares what Judge Forrestier wants!
- Shh, shh, shh. Shh.

470
00:43:34,567 --> 00:43:37,798
Are you sure that the good judge
asked for her personally?

471
00:43:37,887 --> 00:43:39,957
Yes, like I told you.
Come along.

472
00:43:40,047 --> 00:43:43,517
- Let go of me!
- Shut up. Shut up, Simone.

473
00:43:43,607 --> 00:43:48,123
I need a little more time with my client
for consultation. I will call you in a second.

474
00:43:48,207 --> 00:43:50,198
As you say.

475
00:43:58,327 --> 00:44:03,117
I smell an opening. I think that fish-eyed
law book is worried about something.

476
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:07,723
Now, if you will be honest with me,
I will show you how we can save 10,000 francs.

477
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:10,799
- I'm always honest with you.
- Fine.

478
00:44:10,887 --> 00:44:14,675
I want every possible detail,
whatever happened last night.

479
00:44:14,767 --> 00:44:16,837
Did he kiss you?

480
00:44:16,927 --> 00:44:19,600
Francois! How can you say that?

481
00:44:19,687 --> 00:44:23,236
- Do you want to save 10,000?
- Yes, he kissed me.

482
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,125
Where did he kiss you?

483
00:44:26,207 --> 00:44:28,960
- On the lips.
- No, no. I mean in the boudoir...

484
00:44:29,047 --> 00:44:30,799
Francois!

485
00:44:30,887 --> 00:44:33,879
I'm your lawyer.
You can say anything you want to me.

486
00:44:33,967 --> 00:44:36,720
- That's a privileged communication.
- What's that?

487
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:40,402
That means nobody wpll ever know
what you said except you and your lawyer.

488
00:44:40,487 --> 00:44:42,842
Not even me - well, personally, that is.

489
00:44:42,927 --> 00:44:47,239
- Look, I swear I will never throw it up to you.
- It wasn't that terrible.

490
00:44:47,327 --> 00:44:50,956
All right. Now, I want to know every fact
around how he behaved.

491
00:44:51,047 --> 00:44:53,402
I will be him. What happened?

492
00:44:55,967 --> 00:44:59,755
- You sit here.
- There? Mm-hm.

493
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,159
I, uh...

494
00:45:04,007 --> 00:45:06,885
I was... sitting on his lap.

495
00:45:06,967 --> 00:45:08,559
Oh, fine.

496
00:45:08,647 --> 00:45:13,437
- And that's when the kiss happened.
- Well, come on, show me.

497
00:45:14,447 --> 00:45:18,804
No, no, no, no.
Exactly... the full time of the kiss.

498
00:45:25,407 --> 00:45:27,557
Hold it, hold it.

499
00:45:27,647 --> 00:45:29,956
Where were his hands?

500
00:45:41,367 --> 00:45:44,484
I don't think he had his hands on me.

501
00:45:44,567 --> 00:45:46,603
I can believe that.

502
00:45:46,687 --> 00:45:50,441
Obviously that ball of fire
had his hands in his pockets.

503
00:45:50,527 --> 00:45:56,921
Now, you were seated on his lap like this and
the kiss lasted for about five seconds. Right?

504
00:45:57,007 --> 00:45:59,237
That's right. I'm sorry.

505
00:46:00,927 --> 00:46:03,566
- If I only had a reliable witness.
- A witness...

506
00:46:03,647 --> 00:46:06,764
Andre came in. He saw us.

507
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,805
- Are you sure?
- Yes. He spoke to us.

508
00:46:09,887 --> 00:46:13,675
You just saved yourself 10,000 francs.
Jailer!

509
00:46:13,767 --> 00:46:17,601
- What are you going to do?
- Get fixed up best you can. I will be right back.

510
00:46:17,687 --> 00:46:19,723
Don't go away.

511
00:46:24,127 --> 00:46:25,845
Yes?

512
00:46:28,487 --> 00:46:31,047
- Oh, come in. Good morning.
- Good morning.

513
00:46:31,127 --> 00:46:33,800
- Can you spare me a moment?
- Certainly.

514
00:46:33,887 --> 00:46:35,957
Thank you.

515
00:46:38,607 --> 00:46:40,484
What can I do for you, sir?

516
00:46:40,567 --> 00:46:42,558
First, not be so formal.

517
00:46:42,647 --> 00:46:44,524
- Drop the ''sir''?
- Please.

518
00:46:44,607 --> 00:46:46,325
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.

519
00:46:46,407 --> 00:46:48,125
Yes?

520
00:46:51,487 --> 00:46:56,561
There was an interesting item
in the paper this morning.

521
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,480
- About the Bal du Paradis?
- Mm.

522
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:03,276
- Apparently it has been raided again.
- Apparently.

523
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:10,205
I knew this was going to be difficult.

524
00:47:11,127 --> 00:47:14,722
Then let me say it for you.
You want me to be lenient.

525
00:47:15,687 --> 00:47:22,559
My friend, the bestjudge
is the one who judges as little as possible.

526
00:47:22,647 --> 00:47:24,399
I agree.

527
00:47:24,487 --> 00:47:27,877
Don't you ever drink a little too much wine

528
00:47:27,967 --> 00:47:31,323
and chase after young ladies
who are known to run slowly?

529
00:47:31,407 --> 00:47:35,161
Look, I may not go dancing
up and down the Champs-Elysees,

530
00:47:35,247 --> 00:47:38,637
but privately I have as much fun
as any Frenchman in Paris.

531
00:47:38,727 --> 00:47:39,842
Privately?

532
00:47:39,927 --> 00:47:45,126
Yes. I don't see the need to prove to
the whole world that I'm having a good time.

533
00:47:45,207 --> 00:47:47,118
And I do?

534
00:47:47,207 --> 00:47:50,836
No, that's not for me to judge.
It's a matter of taste.

535
00:47:50,927 --> 00:47:53,202
Oh, I see.

536
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:56,484
Now you're ajudge of taste.

537
00:47:57,487 --> 00:48:00,126
- You make me feel ancient.
- Really?

538
00:48:00,207 --> 00:48:03,722
It seems so long ago that I felt
I had to teach everyone how to live.

539
00:48:03,807 --> 00:48:06,401
But doesn't someone have to teach them?

540
00:48:06,487 --> 00:48:08,318
No, Your Honour.

541
00:48:08,407 --> 00:48:13,925
# You just have to let them live...
and let live

542
00:48:14,007 --> 00:48:16,362
# Be, and let be

543
00:48:16,447 --> 00:48:18,836
# Hear, and let hear

544
00:48:18,927 --> 00:48:21,202
# See, and let see

545
00:48:21,287 --> 00:48:23,847
# Sing, and let sing

546
00:48:23,927 --> 00:48:26,316
# Dance, and let dance

547
00:48:26,407 --> 00:48:29,080
- # I like Offenbach
- I do not.

548
00:48:29,167 --> 00:48:31,317
# So what, so what, so what?

549
00:48:31,407 --> 00:48:33,796
# Write, and let write

550
00:48:33,887 --> 00:48:36,321
# Read, and let read

551
00:48:36,407 --> 00:48:38,967
# Love, and let love

552
00:48:39,047 --> 00:48:41,163
# Breed, and let breed

553
00:48:41,247 --> 00:48:43,238
# Live, and let live

554
00:48:43,327 --> 00:48:46,319
# And remember this line:

555
00:48:46,407 --> 00:48:50,878
# Your business is your business
and my business is mine

556
00:48:51,487 --> 00:48:54,365
Sometimes I think
all conversations ought to be sung.

557
00:48:54,447 --> 00:48:56,722
It's so hard to quarrel with a melody.

558
00:48:56,807 --> 00:49:02,040
If you listen carefully, you will find it
just as hard to quarrel with the world.

559
00:49:02,447 --> 00:49:05,405
- # Live, and let live
- Live and let live.

560
00:49:05,487 --> 00:49:07,762
- # Do, and let do
- Do and let do.

561
00:49:07,847 --> 00:49:11,317
- # Hear, and let hear
- All right, but sue and let sue.

562
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:14,843
- # What for? Drink, and let drink
- If you can hold it.

563
00:49:14,927 --> 00:49:16,326
# PIay, and let play

564
00:49:16,407 --> 00:49:19,922
- Within limits. But I think you overdo it.
- I do not.

565
00:49:20,007 --> 00:49:22,157
# So what, so what, so what?

566
00:49:22,247 --> 00:49:24,124
# Pray, and let pray?

567
00:49:24,207 --> 00:49:27,279
# Sure, but slip and let slip

568
00:49:27,367 --> 00:49:28,959
# Dress, and let dress

569
00:49:29,047 --> 00:49:32,039
# That's fine, but strip and let strip

570
00:49:32,127 --> 00:49:34,197
- # Live and let live
- # Live and let live

571
00:49:34,287 --> 00:49:36,960
# And remember this line:

572
00:49:37,047 --> 00:49:39,436
- # Your business...
- # Is my business

573
00:49:39,527 --> 00:49:42,087
- # And your business...
- # Is mine

574
00:49:42,167 --> 00:49:48,640
# Your business is your business
and my business is mine

575
00:49:50,047 --> 00:49:54,325
Paul, you are right. As a matter of fact...
I should have told you this earlier,

576
00:49:54,407 --> 00:49:57,797
but Durnais' client
doesn't need any leniency.

577
00:49:57,887 --> 00:50:01,402
I've decided early this morning that...

578
00:50:01,487 --> 00:50:03,284
Pardon me. Come in.

579
00:50:05,327 --> 00:50:08,637
You sent for me, you marvellous man!

580
00:50:08,727 --> 00:50:09,716
Oh.

581
00:50:09,807 --> 00:50:13,436
- Simone, may I introduce...
- Good morning, Monsieur Barriere.

582
00:50:13,527 --> 00:50:15,279
How do you do, Simone?

583
00:50:15,367 --> 00:50:17,881
- You two know each other?
- Uh...

584
00:50:18,607 --> 00:50:22,395
- You two know each other?
- We certainly do.

585
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:25,399
This is the nicest thing
that's ever happened to me.

586
00:50:25,487 --> 00:50:29,685
Now, be still.
Just for one minute you will be still?

587
00:50:33,407 --> 00:50:34,522
Excellent.

588
00:50:34,607 --> 00:50:36,484
Oh. I see.

589
00:50:36,567 --> 00:50:38,797
- Did you get it?
- Perfect.

590
00:50:38,887 --> 00:50:40,605
Good!

591
00:50:43,847 --> 00:50:45,917
Ah, my dear Paul.

592
00:50:46,007 --> 00:50:49,317
It would seem your friend the crusader
is in a bit of ajam.

593
00:50:49,407 --> 00:50:54,197
Francois! These are magistrates' chambers.
You're acting in contempt.

594
00:50:54,287 --> 00:50:56,323
- Call it disgust.
- Francois.

595
00:50:56,407 --> 00:50:58,204
No, Paul. I know what I'm doing.

596
00:50:58,287 --> 00:51:03,884
I doubt it. That picture, for instance. You wpll
not be permitted to leave the building with it.

597
00:51:03,967 --> 00:51:04,956
- No?
- No.

598
00:51:05,047 --> 00:51:10,041
Well, if I cannot get it out,
apparently it wpll do me no good, wpll it?

599
00:51:11,047 --> 00:51:12,799
Emile!

600
00:51:14,807 --> 00:51:17,605
Someone caught it.
I don't know who it is, of course.

601
00:51:17,687 --> 00:51:20,076
Does this man really want to be disbarred?

602
00:51:20,167 --> 00:51:22,158
He has me worried.

603
00:51:22,247 --> 00:51:25,284
Why do you imagine
you can behave like this to a magistrate?

604
00:51:25,367 --> 00:51:28,439
Ah, but he's not a magistrate now.
He's a defendant.

605
00:51:28,527 --> 00:51:31,883
A defendant, am I?
What an inventive fellow he is.

606
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:34,037
- May I know the charge?
- The charge.

607
00:51:34,127 --> 00:51:37,756
Oh, I don't know...
Invasion of privacy, breach of promise...

608
00:51:37,847 --> 00:51:41,123
Anything that'II give us a chance
to tell our story to the papers.

609
00:51:41,207 --> 00:51:44,483
- I'm sure they will find it interesting.
- They certainly wpll.

610
00:51:44,567 --> 00:51:48,276
They can illustrate it with that picture
I could not get out of the building.

611
00:51:48,367 --> 00:51:52,645
Francois, you'd better have a good excuse
for your conduct. What's the story?

612
00:51:52,727 --> 00:51:55,480
Yes, I'm curious too.

613
00:51:55,567 --> 00:51:59,446
Mademoiselle Pistache, give the gentlemen
an idea of what happened.

614
00:51:59,527 --> 00:52:00,642
Yes.

615
00:52:00,727 --> 00:52:04,037
He offered me 1,000 francs
to take him to my boudoir

616
00:52:04,127 --> 00:52:07,915
and show him something
he had absolutely no business seeing.

617
00:52:08,007 --> 00:52:10,157
Then he forced his attentions on me.

618
00:52:10,247 --> 00:52:14,365
I fought and struggled and pleaded,
but to absolutely no avail.

619
00:52:14,447 --> 00:52:18,076
- He had the strength of a thousand devils!
- A compliment at last.

620
00:52:18,167 --> 00:52:21,762
Then it was quite clear
that if I didn't submit to his evil desires,

621
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:24,759
he'd use his power to persecute me!

622
00:52:24,847 --> 00:52:27,281
Well, what could I do?

623
00:52:27,367 --> 00:52:29,358
Submit, by all means.

624
00:52:29,447 --> 00:52:32,564
Submit?! Submit?

625
00:52:32,647 --> 00:52:37,243
- Never! Never in a thousand years wpll I...
- Simone. Simone, Simone.

626
00:52:38,007 --> 00:52:40,726
Just a generaI idea.
We will write the story later.

627
00:52:40,807 --> 00:52:41,956
Yes.

628
00:52:42,047 --> 00:52:46,245
So I... Well, I refused and I went to jail.

629
00:52:46,327 --> 00:52:49,763
What happened to the strength
of a thousand devils? Did I weaken?

630
00:52:49,847 --> 00:52:54,523
- My virtue robbed you of your strength.
- We must remember that line.

631
00:52:54,607 --> 00:52:58,759
It's a good story, isn't it? Simple,
classical, vivid... The public wpll eat it up.

632
00:52:58,847 --> 00:53:02,044
Probably. It's certain to embarrass me,
at the very least.

633
00:53:02,127 --> 00:53:06,040
- And what do you plan to do about it?
- To Simone, nothing. She's a nice girl.

634
00:53:06,127 --> 00:53:09,358
She isn't capable
of inventing all that dirty nonsense.

635
00:53:09,447 --> 00:53:13,645
But you I shall have disbarred and indicted.

636
00:53:13,967 --> 00:53:16,606
You should change your mind.
When you do, let me know.

637
00:53:16,687 --> 00:53:18,643
Just a second. Simone...

638
00:53:18,727 --> 00:53:22,322
The reason I sent for you
is that I made a mistake last night.

639
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:25,046
- PauI, you're a witness.
- Be quiet, wpll you?

640
00:53:25,127 --> 00:53:28,005
I said I wold not hurt you if I had a choice.

641
00:53:28,087 --> 00:53:31,636
You misunderstood me.
You thought I was promising immunity.

642
00:53:31,727 --> 00:53:35,800
That was why you presented the cancan,
and why you thought I lied to you.

643
00:53:35,887 --> 00:53:39,596
- Don't talk, Simone.
- Yes, don't talk, he's right. Just listen.

644
00:53:39,687 --> 00:53:45,000
I was stupid to have made a statement
you could so easily misinterpret. That's all.

645
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:50,366
And for that reason, I'm going
to withdraw my complaint against you.

646
00:53:50,447 --> 00:53:52,722
- You're what?
- That's very prudent of you.

647
00:53:52,807 --> 00:53:56,038
As you know, PauI,
my decision was made early this morning.

648
00:53:56,127 --> 00:54:00,803
I know you well enough to accept that.
And your decision could not please me more.

649
00:54:00,887 --> 00:54:01,956
Thank you.

650
00:54:02,047 --> 00:54:05,756
Do you mean I can keep my 10,000 francs
and my cafe stays open?

651
00:54:05,847 --> 00:54:07,724
Yes.

652
00:54:07,807 --> 00:54:12,642
- Francois! Francois, you're a genius!
- Of course. I've known it all the time.

653
00:54:12,727 --> 00:54:16,322
Goodbye, children.
I'm delighted no blood was shed.

654
00:54:16,407 --> 00:54:19,205
- Come on, let's celebrate.
- Francois...

655
00:54:19,287 --> 00:54:24,077
WouId you wait for me a moment?
I'd like to thank Judge Forrestier.

656
00:54:26,367 --> 00:54:29,120
All right, but keep your guard up.

657
00:54:37,767 --> 00:54:41,555
I'm awfully sorry I thought you were a prune.

658
00:54:41,647 --> 00:54:43,956
You're forgiven.

659
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:49,041
And I'm sorry I lies about last night.

660
00:54:49,127 --> 00:54:54,326
At least you now have a picture of us -
or Emile has.

661
00:54:54,407 --> 00:54:56,841
Maybe you could get me a copy.

662
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:02,841
I was right last night, wasn't I?
I knew I liked you.

663
00:55:02,927 --> 00:55:04,724
Thank you.

664
00:55:05,767 --> 00:55:07,120
Uh...

665
00:55:07,207 --> 00:55:09,482
Here's a kiss I really mean.

666
00:55:36,034 --> 00:55:40,346
''The State versus Simone Pistache.''

667
00:55:56,794 --> 00:56:02,426
# You do something to me

668
00:56:02,514 --> 00:56:07,383
# Something that simply mystifies me

669
00:56:08,874 --> 00:56:13,106
# TeII me, why should it be

670
00:56:13,714 --> 00:56:18,868
# You have the power to hypnotise me

671
00:56:19,434 --> 00:56:24,554
# Let me live 'neath your spell

672
00:56:24,634 --> 00:56:29,469
# Do do that voodoo
that you do so well

673
00:56:30,074 --> 00:56:35,387
# For you do something to me

674
00:56:35,474 --> 00:56:40,468
# That nobody else can do

675
00:56:47,394 --> 00:56:49,430
# It's mystifying

676
00:56:58,714 --> 00:57:01,069
# Hypnotising

677
00:57:03,154 --> 00:57:06,988
# Let me live 'neath your speII

678
00:57:07,074 --> 00:57:12,102
# Do do that voodoo
that you do so well

679
00:57:12,194 --> 00:57:18,793
# For you do something to me

680
00:57:18,874 --> 00:57:23,026
# That nobody else

681
00:57:23,354 --> 00:57:27,745
# That nobody else

682
00:57:28,274 --> 00:57:34,065
# No, nobody else

683
00:57:34,154 --> 00:57:39,592
# Can do

684
00:57:52,394 --> 00:57:53,952
Francois...

685
00:57:54,034 --> 00:57:56,867
You have my undivided attention.

686
00:57:59,154 --> 00:58:04,387
You know, I'm... growing
fonder and fonder of you every day.

687
00:58:04,474 --> 00:58:06,271
Mm, that's nice.

688
00:58:06,354 --> 00:58:10,825
Tell me something.
You thinking about the same thing I am?

689
00:58:11,834 --> 00:58:15,429
I was thinking about marriage.

690
00:58:16,354 --> 00:58:19,664
- Went down the wrong way.
- It always goes down the wrong way.

691
00:58:19,754 --> 00:58:21,824
Will you please tell me why?

692
00:58:21,914 --> 00:58:23,905
I will tell you why.

693
00:58:23,994 --> 00:58:27,589
Because I'd much rather
be in love with you than marry you.

694
00:58:27,674 --> 00:58:30,188
Could not we arrange to do both?

695
00:58:30,274 --> 00:58:33,425
No, sweetheart, we can't,
if you want to be realistic.

696
00:58:33,514 --> 00:58:40,272
Look, in my opinion the biggest reason
in the world today for infidelity is marriage.

697
00:58:40,354 --> 00:58:45,986
Eliminate marriage, and you will never see
any such thing as an unfaithful husband.

698
00:58:46,074 --> 00:58:48,827
Cut off your legs
so you will never have flat feet.

699
00:58:48,914 --> 00:58:52,190
Go ahead, be funny. I thought
you wanted to discuss this seriously.

700
00:58:52,274 --> 00:58:57,553
I do, but eliminate marriage?!
We can't discuss it seriously then.

701
00:58:57,634 --> 00:58:59,784
Well, let me finish.

702
00:58:59,874 --> 00:59:01,705
- I'm the lawyer, right?
- Yes.

703
00:59:01,794 --> 00:59:06,629
Now, I see the seamy side of marriage -
the point where it's beginning to break up.

704
00:59:06,714 --> 00:59:09,353
In each case
the history's exactly the same -

705
00:59:09,434 --> 00:59:12,949
after about a year's time
the man discovers another girl.

706
00:59:13,034 --> 00:59:18,028
Now, he can't spend much time with his
new puff because he'd have to lie to his wife.

707
00:59:18,114 --> 00:59:20,867
So what does he do? He lies.

708
00:59:20,954 --> 00:59:22,945
And then he feels guilty,

709
00:59:23,034 --> 00:59:27,107
and he doesn't want to see his wife any more
because he doesn't like feeling guilty.

710
00:59:27,194 --> 00:59:30,266
So two people
who were once in love with each other

711
00:59:30,354 --> 00:59:32,993
are now separated,
unhappy and miserable.

712
00:59:33,074 --> 00:59:37,067
And why? Because they were stupid enough
to get married in the first place.

713
00:59:37,154 --> 00:59:39,384
It's beyond me.

714
00:59:40,274 --> 00:59:43,869
Guess I never really thought of it that way.

715
00:59:43,954 --> 00:59:48,709
It's the only way to think about it, darling.
Direct, straight from the shoulder.

716
00:59:48,794 --> 00:59:54,232
Oh, you monster! The way you twist
everything around to get your own way!

717
00:59:54,314 --> 00:59:57,989
- Well, it makes sense, doesn't it?
- No, it doesn't. Not to me.

718
00:59:58,074 --> 01:00:01,828
Of course it does, sweetheart.
Why get married and lose each other?

719
01:00:01,914 --> 01:00:04,906
Let's just be in love. It's more fun.
Everybody does it.

720
01:00:04,994 --> 01:00:08,430
Why, even in France
the best upper sets do it.

721
01:00:08,514 --> 01:00:11,506
# Lithuanians and Letts do it

722
01:00:11,594 --> 01:00:12,947
# Let's do it

723
01:00:13,034 --> 01:00:15,104
# Let's fall in love

724
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:21,144
- Oh, I've heard that before.
- # In old Japan all the Japs do it

725
01:00:21,234 --> 01:00:24,351
# Up in Lapland, little Laps do it

726
01:00:24,434 --> 01:00:26,026
# Let's do it

727
01:00:26,114 --> 01:00:28,309
# Let's fall in love

728
01:00:28,394 --> 01:00:29,543
I know.

729
01:00:29,634 --> 01:00:34,105
# The Dutch in old Amsterdam do it

730
01:00:34,194 --> 01:00:36,264
# Not to mention the Fins

731
01:00:37,034 --> 01:00:40,026
# Folks in Siam do it

732
01:00:40,114 --> 01:00:42,264
# Think of Siamese twins

733
01:00:42,354 --> 01:00:46,393
# In shallow shoals
English soles do it

734
01:00:46,474 --> 01:00:49,864
# Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it

735
01:00:49,954 --> 01:00:51,592
# Let's do it

736
01:00:51,674 --> 01:00:54,188
# Let's fall in love

737
01:00:54,834 --> 01:00:59,305
# The chimpanzees in the zoos do it

738
01:00:59,394 --> 01:01:02,591
# Some courageous kangaroos do it

739
01:01:02,674 --> 01:01:04,312
# Let's do it

740
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:06,464
# Let's fall in love

741
01:01:07,474 --> 01:01:11,911
# I'm sure giraffes on the sly do it

742
01:01:11,994 --> 01:01:15,430
# Even eagles as they fly do it

743
01:01:15,514 --> 01:01:17,152
# Let's do it

744
01:01:17,234 --> 01:01:19,304
# Let's fall in love

745
01:01:20,434 --> 01:01:24,791
# Electric eels, I might add, do it

746
01:01:24,874 --> 01:01:26,671
# Though it shocks 'em, I know

747
01:01:26,754 --> 01:01:27,743
Argh!

748
01:01:28,354 --> 01:01:31,266
# Why ask if shad do it?

749
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:33,629
# Garcon, the shad roe

750
01:01:33,714 --> 01:01:37,502
# The world admits bears in pits do it

751
01:01:37,594 --> 01:01:40,904
# Even Pekingeses at the Ritz do it

752
01:01:40,994 --> 01:01:42,712
# Let's do it

753
01:01:42,794 --> 01:01:45,547
# Let's fall in love

754
01:02:11,874 --> 01:02:16,629
# The royal set sans regret did it

755
01:02:16,714 --> 01:02:19,353
# And they considered it fun

756
01:02:19,434 --> 01:02:23,029
# Marie Antoinette did it

757
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:25,582
# With or without Napoleon

758
01:02:25,674 --> 01:02:29,303
# Parliament, pleasure-bent, did it

759
01:02:29,394 --> 01:02:32,943
# Mademoiselles, every time
they're short of rent, did it

760
01:02:33,034 --> 01:02:34,706
# Let's do it

761
01:02:34,794 --> 01:02:39,185
# Let's fall in love

762
01:02:48,674 --> 01:02:52,872
- Well, how much did we lose last night?
- Not too bad, mademoiselle.

763
01:02:52,954 --> 01:02:56,424
We will never get this place paid for.
What's this?

764
01:02:56,514 --> 01:02:58,664
200 francs just for sugar?

765
01:02:58,754 --> 01:03:03,191
- The pastry cook, you will have to speak to him.
- Speak to him? I will bake him!

766
01:03:03,274 --> 01:03:05,265
What's this chromo?

767
01:03:05,954 --> 01:03:07,706
TouIouse-Lautrec.

768
01:03:07,794 --> 01:03:09,785
It's yours, mademoiselle.

769
01:03:09,874 --> 01:03:11,671
You didn't? Not again!

770
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:16,828
But he is a fine painter. And he didn't
eat much - 3 francs, 40 centimes.

771
01:03:16,914 --> 01:03:22,784
I don't care, Andre. I want the money.
I have a cellar full of this trash!

772
01:03:27,074 --> 01:03:29,383
- Hello again.
- Oh, hello.

773
01:03:29,474 --> 01:03:31,863
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.

774
01:03:31,954 --> 01:03:33,785
- Will that be all?
- Yes, Andre.

775
01:03:33,874 --> 01:03:37,753
Bring me the accounts
as soon as you've balanced them.

776
01:03:37,834 --> 01:03:41,713
- I certainly wasn't expecting company.
- You look very nice.

777
01:03:41,794 --> 01:03:45,150
Thank you, but I'm sure I look a fright.

778
01:03:45,234 --> 01:03:47,350
What are you doing here?

779
01:03:47,434 --> 01:03:49,425
I don't know.

780
01:03:50,554 --> 01:03:55,753
Is anything wrong? We won't do the cancan
for a while, if that's what's worrying you.

781
01:03:55,834 --> 01:03:58,473
- Oh, I'm not worried.
- Not worried...

782
01:03:58,554 --> 01:04:00,863
Well, would you like to have a drink?

783
01:04:00,954 --> 01:04:05,072
No, thank you.
All I'd like right now is to ask you a question.

784
01:04:05,834 --> 01:04:08,871
Will you have dinner with me tonight?

785
01:04:09,674 --> 01:04:11,187
Oh...

786
01:04:11,274 --> 01:04:13,788
I'm terribly sorry, but I have an engagement.

787
01:04:13,874 --> 01:04:16,069
Could not you break it?

788
01:04:16,154 --> 01:04:19,988
You wold not want me to have trouble
with my gentleman friend, would you?

789
01:04:20,074 --> 01:04:22,065
Of course not. Of course.

790
01:04:22,154 --> 01:04:23,906
I'm very sorry.

791
01:04:23,994 --> 01:04:26,030
It's quite all right.

792
01:04:26,834 --> 01:04:28,870
Good afternoon.

793
01:04:28,954 --> 01:04:30,785
Afternoon.

794
01:05:02,514 --> 01:05:04,664
Simone?

795
01:05:05,874 --> 01:05:10,231
- Don't you ever knock?
- But... there's no door.

796
01:05:10,314 --> 01:05:12,270
I'm sorry.

797
01:05:12,354 --> 01:05:15,903
It's all right.
I suppose I do wear less when I'm dancing.

798
01:05:15,994 --> 01:05:19,191
- Simone, about your engagement tonight...
- Yes?

799
01:05:19,274 --> 01:05:23,552
I could meet you afterwards.
Say, about eleven.

800
01:05:23,634 --> 01:05:26,023
I'm sorry, itjust wold not work out.

801
01:05:26,114 --> 01:05:29,629
- Twelve, then?
- No, really, I can't.

802
01:05:30,554 --> 01:05:32,146
Well...

803
01:05:33,354 --> 01:05:36,266
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

804
01:06:12,074 --> 01:06:14,224
- Simone!
- Argh!

805
01:06:14,314 --> 01:06:20,071
Simone, I can't stand it. You are not going out
with another man. I won't allow it.

806
01:06:20,154 --> 01:06:22,748
Judge Forrestier, please! I'm not dressed!

807
01:06:22,834 --> 01:06:26,543
- Never mind that. Answer my question.
- What question? Will you please...

808
01:06:26,634 --> 01:06:29,023
I love you! I love you.
That's the question.

809
01:06:29,114 --> 01:06:33,630
- And you will answer it before I leave this room.
- Answer what? How?

810
01:06:33,714 --> 01:06:39,107
Don't pretend you don't know what to say
when a man says he loves and wants you.

811
01:06:39,194 --> 01:06:41,549
Oh, I see. A proposition.

812
01:06:41,634 --> 01:06:45,547
Say you don't love anyone else.
Swear you never wpll love anyone else.

813
01:06:45,634 --> 01:06:47,625
Take your hands off me.

814
01:06:47,714 --> 01:06:51,468
The way you men maul me,
just because I run a cafe!

815
01:06:51,554 --> 01:06:54,512
It's insulting, that's what it is.
It's insulting.

816
01:06:54,594 --> 01:07:00,624
Look, Simone, you're taking to a man
who's been a bachelor for 32 proud years.

817
01:07:00,714 --> 01:07:03,103
I've resisted marriage all this time.

818
01:07:03,194 --> 01:07:05,662
Now you come along,
I get stuck, I can't sleep,

819
01:07:05,754 --> 01:07:08,507
I'm asking you to marry me,
and you call it insulting?

820
01:07:08,594 --> 01:07:11,154
What, please,
would you consider a compliment?!

821
01:07:11,234 --> 01:07:15,352
- You mean you're asking me to marry you?
- Yes! Yes, I am! I am!

822
01:07:15,434 --> 01:07:18,107
I don't understand it, but I am.

823
01:07:18,194 --> 01:07:20,424
With my whole heart I'm asking you.

824
01:07:22,034 --> 01:07:24,548
Pardon me, I have to sit down.

825
01:07:28,114 --> 01:07:31,743
I've never had a proposal before -
of marriage, I mean.

826
01:07:31,834 --> 01:07:35,304
I like that. I like that very much.

827
01:07:35,394 --> 01:07:39,103
It shows I'm the only smart man
in the world.

828
01:07:41,434 --> 01:07:44,471
- A genuine proposal...
- Yes.

829
01:07:45,474 --> 01:07:48,830
I was beginning to think
it might never happen.

830
01:07:48,914 --> 01:07:51,428
Oh, now wait. I don't really know you.

831
01:07:51,514 --> 01:07:56,144
I don't know you any better.
That's what makes it fascinating.

832
01:07:58,354 --> 01:08:00,822
Madame Forrestier...

833
01:08:02,674 --> 01:08:04,790
It is a loveIy name.

834
01:08:04,874 --> 01:08:06,592
Perfect.

835
01:08:08,354 --> 01:08:10,584
Oh, you must be out of your mind.

836
01:08:10,674 --> 01:08:13,632
Madame Forrestier, don't talk, please.
Hold still.

837
01:08:13,714 --> 01:08:18,265
- For you to ask me to marry you is crazy.
- It's the craziest thing I've ever done.

838
01:08:18,354 --> 01:08:22,666
But Judge Forrestier...
Oh, my. What's your first name?

839
01:08:22,754 --> 01:08:24,790
Philippe. Do you like it?

840
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:28,153
Philippe... Yes.

841
01:08:29,474 --> 01:08:32,625
Oh, but I must be honest,
I haven't fallen in love with you.

842
01:08:32,714 --> 01:08:36,229
Of course not. You admitted learn.

843
01:08:36,314 --> 01:08:40,353
- That's what engagements are for.
- But I'm in love with someone else.

844
01:08:40,434 --> 01:08:44,393
Naturally. Everyone falls in love once or twice
before they get married.

845
01:08:44,474 --> 01:08:47,034
You will forget him in no time.

846
01:08:48,634 --> 01:08:53,150
Oh, but you're ajudge.
You're ajudge and so respectable.

847
01:08:53,234 --> 01:08:56,385
I'm just... a dance-hall girl.

848
01:08:57,954 --> 01:09:00,673
Are you a liar? Are you cheap?
Are you a thief?

849
01:09:00,754 --> 01:09:05,464
- Of course not!
- Then you're respectable and decent.

850
01:09:05,554 --> 01:09:11,504
You're as good as anyone on earth and better
than most - and I will never let you forget it.

851
01:09:12,354 --> 01:09:13,833
Oh.

852
01:09:15,834 --> 01:09:19,190
Oh, I think maybe
I could fall in love with you.

853
01:09:19,274 --> 01:09:20,946
Simone...

854
01:09:24,154 --> 01:09:25,667
We are going...

855
01:09:25,754 --> 01:09:29,793
Simone, what a good time
we're going to have.

856
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:34,994
Now, I will call for you in an hour.
We will have dinner at Avenonville.

857
01:09:35,074 --> 01:09:41,309
Oh, and by the way, from now on
never entertain a man in a towel, hm?

858
01:09:57,634 --> 01:09:58,669
Oh.

859
01:09:58,754 --> 01:10:01,029
- Good afternoon.
- Same to you, my good fellow.

860
01:10:01,114 --> 01:10:02,786
Thank you.

861
01:10:11,434 --> 01:10:13,584
Hey there, first prize.

862
01:10:14,834 --> 01:10:17,064
Where's my French pastry?

863
01:10:19,034 --> 01:10:21,389
- What are you doing?
- Francois...

864
01:10:21,474 --> 01:10:24,307
- What was that hanging judge doing here?
- Francois...

865
01:10:24,394 --> 01:10:27,943
He had an awful hot gleams
in that cold eye of his.

866
01:10:28,634 --> 01:10:32,070
Were you sitting around here
in that thing while he was here?

867
01:10:32,154 --> 01:10:34,304
- Yes. Francois?
- What do you want?

868
01:10:34,394 --> 01:10:36,385
Will you marry me?

869
01:10:36,474 --> 01:10:41,867
You'd better refresh me again.
Didn't we settle that question wearier?

870
01:10:42,874 --> 01:10:45,866
I suppose we did.
I can't have dinner with you tonight,

871
01:10:45,954 --> 01:10:49,310
I don't want to see you any more,
and I don't want you as my lawyer.

872
01:10:49,394 --> 01:10:54,673
Hold it. I can understand you're trying to
break a date, but let's not get carried away.

873
01:10:54,754 --> 01:10:57,427
I mean everything I'm saying.

874
01:10:57,514 --> 01:11:02,588
Let me see. I left you at 3:30
and we were in love. It's now 5:30.

875
01:11:03,594 --> 01:11:08,110
I understand that these things don't last
a lifetime, but should not it taper off a bit?

876
01:11:08,194 --> 01:11:10,503
Will you not argue, please?

877
01:11:10,594 --> 01:11:13,154
What could've happened
between then and now?

878
01:11:13,234 --> 01:11:17,068
I haven't lost weight, no scandal in the
papers, my pants aren't on backwards...

879
01:11:17,154 --> 01:11:21,670
Don't talk about pants in front of me!
I'm respectable.

880
01:11:22,594 --> 01:11:25,904
- What's wrong with the word ''pants''?
- You said it again!

881
01:11:25,994 --> 01:11:29,907
Now listen, I'm not cheap,
I'm not a liar and I'm not a thief.

882
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:32,906
I want to be treated with respect.

883
01:11:34,754 --> 01:11:37,314
Are you taking to me
or are you making a speech?

884
01:11:37,394 --> 01:11:42,673
Look, something is obviously upsetting you.
If you tell me about it, I will try to fix it for you.

885
01:11:47,114 --> 01:11:49,469
I find that highly amusing!

886
01:11:49,554 --> 01:11:52,193
You'll fix it for me? Pardon my mirth.

887
01:11:53,194 --> 01:11:55,628
What'd you do, swallow a flute?

888
01:11:55,714 --> 01:11:59,707
It might interest you to know
that I am going to marry.

889
01:11:59,794 --> 01:12:04,072
- Congratulations. Anybody in particular?
- Very particular.

890
01:12:04,154 --> 01:12:08,386
Don't use that old trick on me.
Women have tried to use that before -

891
01:12:08,474 --> 01:12:11,546
telling me they're marrying someone
to put the pressure on me.

892
01:12:11,634 --> 01:12:14,671
If I'd fallen for that,
I'd have been hooked twelve times.

893
01:12:14,754 --> 01:12:18,633
- You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
- I just know what I know.

894
01:12:18,714 --> 01:12:22,423
You might also be interested
to know his name.

895
01:12:22,514 --> 01:12:25,631
It happens to be Judge Philippe Forrestier.

896
01:12:25,714 --> 01:12:27,705
Don't say that, even in fun.

897
01:12:27,794 --> 01:12:32,948
So please take your departure, my good man,
or I may have to summon aid.

898
01:12:33,034 --> 01:12:37,425
You know, I believe it's true.
You're even beginning to sound like him.

899
01:12:37,514 --> 01:12:40,950
Simone, if you want to jump off a bridge,
I won't stand in your way.

900
01:12:41,034 --> 01:12:44,663
But I won't let you marry this man.
I would never forgive myself.

901
01:12:44,754 --> 01:12:47,109
Why? Because he's decent
and honest and fair?

902
01:12:47,194 --> 01:12:49,913
No, because I know you.
You'd go mad.

903
01:12:49,994 --> 01:12:53,066
And besides that,
he's a big flannel-mouthed bore.

904
01:12:53,154 --> 01:12:57,193
If you want to punish me, go ahead.
Cut off one of my fingers. Go on, pick one.

905
01:12:57,274 --> 01:13:00,232
If it was your tongue, I might be tempted!

906
01:13:00,314 --> 01:13:04,592
All right. We will have it your way.
I'm leaving.

907
01:13:04,674 --> 01:13:06,790
And I wpll not be back!

908
01:13:06,874 --> 01:13:10,913
There are other young ladies in Paris
as attractive and charming as you are

909
01:13:10,994 --> 01:13:12,871
and a damn sight more sincere!

910
01:13:12,954 --> 01:13:14,626
- Sincere?
- Sincere.

911
01:13:14,714 --> 01:13:20,425
Sincere! I'm surprised that word
doesn't turn to stone in your mouth.

912
01:13:21,434 --> 01:13:24,107
What are we fighting about?

913
01:13:24,194 --> 01:13:26,264
You know I'm crazy about you.

914
01:13:26,354 --> 01:13:30,632
- Not enough to marry me, you're not.
- What's marriage got to do with it?!

915
01:13:30,714 --> 01:13:33,672
I understand marriage
has something to do with love.

916
01:13:33,754 --> 01:13:36,826
When a man loves a woman
he's willing to give her his name.

917
01:13:36,914 --> 01:13:39,189
Names! Names don't mean anything.

918
01:13:39,274 --> 01:13:41,708
The widest woman I ever met
was named Prudence.

919
01:13:41,794 --> 01:13:44,183
And why do they call
all the crooks Honest John?

920
01:13:44,274 --> 01:13:46,742
I even knew a girl
who called herself Virginia.

921
01:13:46,834 --> 01:13:49,394
For heaven sakes, go away.

922
01:13:52,434 --> 01:13:54,584
All right, Simone. I will leave.

923
01:13:54,674 --> 01:13:57,188
And this is permanent.

924
01:13:57,274 --> 01:14:02,632
Nothing is ever permanent with you.
You're too selfish.

925
01:14:43,994 --> 01:14:45,427
Francois!

926
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:50,349
- What is it?
- Oh, la-la. What are you mad at?

927
01:14:51,634 --> 01:14:53,670
Not you, sweetheart.

928
01:14:54,194 --> 01:14:55,388
Ah.

929
01:14:55,474 --> 01:14:58,272
- Mind if I have a drink?
- Pull up a chair.

930
01:14:58,354 --> 01:15:00,345
I'm lonesome.

931
01:15:00,434 --> 01:15:04,712
Oh, no, none of that. I will take Cognac.

932
01:15:06,754 --> 01:15:10,144
You're too cute a girl
to be spending a lonesome afternoon.

933
01:15:10,234 --> 01:15:15,911
Francois. You always say something nice,
but you never do anything about it.

934
01:15:18,794 --> 01:15:20,910
What are you thinking?

935
01:15:22,874 --> 01:15:24,865
What a rainy day it is.

936
01:15:24,954 --> 01:15:30,392
- Rainy? Oh, but it's a beautiful day.
- That's what I said.

937
01:15:30,474 --> 01:15:36,071
You know, Francois,
I could be very helpful in a crisis.

938
01:15:38,714 --> 01:15:40,784
I believe you could.

939
01:15:40,874 --> 01:15:43,149
But I'm sorry, sweetheart.

940
01:15:43,794 --> 01:15:47,150
# It's the wrong time

941
01:15:47,794 --> 01:15:51,309
# And the wrong place

942
01:15:52,074 --> 01:15:55,953
# Though your face is charming

943
01:15:56,034 --> 01:15:58,423
# It's the wrong face

944
01:15:59,634 --> 01:16:02,592
# It's not her face

945
01:16:03,034 --> 01:16:05,025
# But such a...

946
01:16:05,714 --> 01:16:08,626
# Charming face

947
01:16:09,314 --> 01:16:16,948
# That it's all right with me

948
01:16:17,994 --> 01:16:22,067
# It's the wrong song

949
01:16:22,714 --> 01:16:26,150
# In the wrong style

950
01:16:26,914 --> 01:16:31,305
# Though your smile is loveIy

951
01:16:31,394 --> 01:16:34,431
# It's the wrong smile

952
01:16:35,034 --> 01:16:38,390
# It's not her smile

953
01:16:38,994 --> 01:16:44,705
# But such a loveIy smile

954
01:16:45,394 --> 01:16:49,148
# That it's all right

955
01:16:50,194 --> 01:16:52,583
# With me

956
01:16:55,914 --> 01:17:00,590
# You can't know how happy I am

957
01:17:00,674 --> 01:17:02,710
# That we met

958
01:17:02,794 --> 01:17:08,232
# I'm strangely attracted to you

959
01:17:10,074 --> 01:17:17,071
# There's someone
I'm trying so hard to forget

960
01:17:18,754 --> 01:17:24,351
# Don't you want to forget someone too?

961
01:17:26,994 --> 01:17:32,432
# It's the wrong game

962
01:17:33,034 --> 01:17:36,185
# With the wrong chips

963
01:17:36,994 --> 01:17:41,385
# Though your lips are tempting

964
01:17:41,474 --> 01:17:44,432
# They're the wrong lips

965
01:17:45,154 --> 01:17:48,703
# They're not her lips

966
01:17:49,394 --> 01:17:52,227
# But they're such...

967
01:17:52,954 --> 01:17:56,185
# Tempting lips

968
01:17:57,594 --> 01:18:01,143
# That if some night

969
01:18:01,794 --> 01:18:04,706
# You're free

970
01:18:06,674 --> 01:18:11,668
# Dear, it's all right

971
01:18:12,674 --> 01:18:17,384
# Yes, it's all right

972
01:18:19,154 --> 01:18:23,033
# With me

973
01:18:28,674 --> 01:18:32,587
# Though your Iips are tempting

974
01:18:33,234 --> 01:18:36,351
# They're the wrong lips

975
01:18:37,194 --> 01:18:41,585
# They're not her lips

976
01:18:42,914 --> 01:18:45,986
# But they're such...

977
01:18:48,274 --> 01:18:52,062
# Tempting lips

978
01:18:52,754 --> 01:18:57,509
# That if some night

979
01:18:58,474 --> 01:19:01,386
# You're free

980
01:19:03,474 --> 01:19:08,707
# Dear, it's all right

981
01:19:09,354 --> 01:19:15,589
# Yes, it's all right

982
01:19:16,674 --> 01:19:24,786
# With me

983
01:23:09,714 --> 01:23:11,466
PhiIipe. Ha-ha!

984
01:23:11,554 --> 01:23:14,387
Do you know what you said
to the prosecuting attorney

985
01:23:14,474 --> 01:23:17,784
when he asked for a writ of certiorari?

986
01:23:17,874 --> 01:23:20,547
You said, ''Yes, dear.''

987
01:23:20,634 --> 01:23:25,264
''Yes, dear''! To the prosecuting attorney!

988
01:23:26,274 --> 01:23:29,186
That's Montmartre over there, on the hiII.

989
01:23:29,274 --> 01:23:32,152
I know. I know where Montmartre is.

990
01:23:32,234 --> 01:23:35,385
I know it as well as anyone in Paris.

991
01:23:35,474 --> 01:23:37,465
LoveIy sight.

992
01:23:40,034 --> 01:23:42,832
Do you always throw your pen
out of the window?

993
01:23:42,914 --> 01:23:45,144
That was my cigarette.

994
01:23:47,634 --> 01:23:49,226
Philippe.

995
01:23:49,834 --> 01:23:52,746
Philippe, who is she?

996
01:23:59,714 --> 01:24:03,912
I know, I know.
Ooh-la-la-la, c'est magnifique!

997
01:24:04,714 --> 01:24:08,673
- You don't mean Simone Pistache?
- I do. I do.

998
01:24:08,754 --> 01:24:10,904
Simone's going to marry me.

999
01:24:12,794 --> 01:24:14,910
- Marry you?
- Yes. Yes, me.

1000
01:24:14,994 --> 01:24:18,987
Not your friend Francois Durnais. Me.

1001
01:24:19,074 --> 01:24:20,223
Oh...

1002
01:24:20,314 --> 01:24:22,544
But you cannot marry her.

1003
01:24:22,634 --> 01:24:25,228
Amplify that statement, wpll you?

1004
01:24:25,714 --> 01:24:29,673
Better still, I will condense it:
goodbye, career.

1005
01:24:29,754 --> 01:24:33,906
Marry a cabaret entertainer
and the city council wpll forget your name.

1006
01:24:33,994 --> 01:24:37,304
- The councilmen aren't all snobs.
- Their wives are.

1007
01:24:37,394 --> 01:24:41,672
What about Councilman Lagouche?
His wife used to be the biggest...

1008
01:24:41,754 --> 01:24:45,303
But Lagouche was elected,
not appointed like you.

1009
01:24:45,394 --> 01:24:49,831
- If I have to, I will get elected.
- Philippe, you have background, ability.

1010
01:24:49,914 --> 01:24:55,432
I just can't sit back and watch you throw
your future out of the window like your pen!

1011
01:24:55,514 --> 01:24:59,507
PauI, Paul, you've forgotten
your own philosophy.

1012
01:24:59,594 --> 01:25:01,550
# Live, and let live

1013
01:25:01,634 --> 01:25:04,228
Yes, but think, my boy, think.

1014
01:25:04,314 --> 01:25:06,874
Take care! Take care!

1015
01:25:06,954 --> 01:25:09,422
# Drink, and let drink

1016
01:25:09,514 --> 01:25:11,232
# Dance, and let dance

1017
01:25:11,314 --> 01:25:14,386
Yes, but not with Simone.

1018
01:25:14,474 --> 01:25:17,352
- I think she's right for me.
- I do not.

1019
01:25:17,434 --> 01:25:19,743
# So what, so what, so what?

1020
01:25:19,834 --> 01:25:22,064
- # PIay, and let play
- With your own set.

1021
01:25:22,154 --> 01:25:24,509
- # Sing, and let sing
- You've got me upset.

1022
01:25:24,594 --> 01:25:26,824
- # Shout, and let shout
- You're going mad.

1023
01:25:26,914 --> 01:25:29,553
- # No, glad! I'm so glad!
- This is bad.

1024
01:25:29,634 --> 01:25:34,230
# I hate to mention it, Your Honour,
but remember this line:

1025
01:25:34,314 --> 01:25:36,544
- # Your business...
- # But such business!

1026
01:25:36,634 --> 01:25:39,148
# And my business is mine

1027
01:25:39,234 --> 01:25:41,464
# Your business is your business

1028
01:25:41,554 --> 01:25:45,513
# And my business is mine

1029
01:25:50,594 --> 01:25:51,868
Good evening, sir.

1030
01:25:51,954 --> 01:25:55,310
Good evening.
I was told I might find Monsieur Durnais here.

1031
01:25:55,394 --> 01:25:58,113
Monsieur Durnais is right there, sir.

1032
01:26:26,674 --> 01:26:28,824
500 francs. Pay me.

1033
01:26:28,914 --> 01:26:33,749
- Take it. I wold not have done that for 5,000.
- You have no faith in your fellow men.

1034
01:26:33,834 --> 01:26:35,790
- Francois.
- Ah, Paul.

1035
01:26:35,874 --> 01:26:38,468
Sit down, sit down.
Did you catch my act?

1036
01:26:38,554 --> 01:26:43,230
- You must be starved for diversion.
- Well, I concede I'm a bit moody.

1037
01:26:43,314 --> 01:26:45,350
Francois, I have to talk to you.

1038
01:26:45,434 --> 01:26:50,110
What are you going to do about
your friend Simone and Philippe Forrestier?

1039
01:26:50,194 --> 01:26:52,549
Nothing. Not a thing.

1040
01:26:52,634 --> 01:26:55,990
How can I compete
with a man who's willing to get married?

1041
01:26:56,074 --> 01:26:58,349
It's like playing cards with a cheat.

1042
01:26:58,434 --> 01:27:01,585
- There are ways to outwit a cheat.
- Like what, Paul?

1043
01:27:01,674 --> 01:27:05,303
You tell me, Francois.
You're the schemer.

1044
01:27:06,714 --> 01:27:10,627
I've thought about murder,
suicide, chronic alcoholism,

1045
01:27:10,714 --> 01:27:13,023
but none of those things satisfy me.

1046
01:27:13,114 --> 01:27:15,105
No other schemes?

1047
01:27:15,194 --> 01:27:18,027
Yes, one more. Forget she ever existed.

1048
01:27:18,114 --> 01:27:19,911
Ah, no. No, no, no, no.

1049
01:27:19,994 --> 01:27:24,067
That's called giving up,
and you love her too much for that.

1050
01:27:24,154 --> 01:27:27,430
There must be some way
to prevent this impossible marriage...

1051
01:27:27,514 --> 01:27:29,186
Paul...

1052
01:27:30,274 --> 01:27:32,742
- An inspiration?
- Mm...

1053
01:27:34,394 --> 01:27:37,466
Would you give them an engagement party

1054
01:27:37,554 --> 01:27:40,751
and invite all of the social bigwigs in Paris?

1055
01:27:40,834 --> 01:27:44,349
But Francois, I'm against this marriage.

1056
01:27:45,914 --> 01:27:48,986
So am I, Paul. So am I.

1057
01:27:59,194 --> 01:28:03,665
- Oh, Philippe, I don't know.
- Don't be nervous. They're just people.

1058
01:28:03,754 --> 01:28:05,984
I've never had stage fright before.

1059
01:28:06,074 --> 01:28:08,304
It's such a distinguished party, isn't it?

1060
01:28:08,394 --> 01:28:11,591
So distinguished,
it might be difficult to keep awake.

1061
01:28:11,674 --> 01:28:14,666
- Good evening, my dear.
- Oh, gracious host!

1062
01:28:14,754 --> 01:28:17,222
So gratified, I assure you.

1063
01:28:17,314 --> 01:28:19,305
- How are you, Philippe?
- Fine, fine.

1064
01:28:19,394 --> 01:28:22,306
- This is a marvellous idea for a party.
- It is, isn't it?

1065
01:28:22,394 --> 01:28:25,704
My dear Philippe! I am so happy for you.

1066
01:28:25,794 --> 01:28:28,354
- Is this your enchanting fiancee?
- Yes.

1067
01:28:28,434 --> 01:28:31,426
The Duchess de Grimont,
may I introduce Miss Pistache.

1068
01:28:31,514 --> 01:28:32,503
Nice.

1069
01:28:32,594 --> 01:28:36,030
So gratified to encounter you,
Your Grace, I assure you.

1070
01:28:36,114 --> 01:28:38,674
Particularity on such a distinguished boat.

1071
01:28:38,754 --> 01:28:42,429
Witty, too. May I borrow
your fiance for a moment?

1072
01:28:42,514 --> 01:28:46,826
There's a lady here who thought she was
going to get him. I want to depress her.

1073
01:28:46,914 --> 01:28:49,553
A little later?
I'd rather not leave Simone.

1074
01:28:49,634 --> 01:28:53,513
Oh, no, Philippe, please.
You mustn't refuse her graciousness.

1075
01:28:53,594 --> 01:28:58,793
Run along, run along. I will just stand here with
Paul and enjoy the distinguished gathering.

1076
01:28:58,874 --> 01:29:00,865
I will be back.

1077
01:29:00,954 --> 01:29:06,028
- May I get you a glass of champagne?
- Oh, I'd be so gratified, I assure you.

1078
01:29:06,114 --> 01:29:10,471
- Simone. How are you, sweetheart?
- I will find a waiter.

1079
01:29:10,554 --> 01:29:12,909
And what are you doing here?

1080
01:29:12,994 --> 01:29:16,350
Celebrating your betrothal,
just like everyone else is.

1081
01:29:16,434 --> 01:29:20,712
I do not wish to seem unfriendly
in my great hour of happiness,

1082
01:29:20,794 --> 01:29:23,467
but get out of here, you louse!

1083
01:29:24,434 --> 01:29:27,107
Sweetheart, you're a little nervous.
Calm down.

1084
01:29:27,194 --> 01:29:30,982
I know I'm nervous, Francois.
You're not helping things any.

1085
01:29:31,074 --> 01:29:32,905
Champagne?

1086
01:29:32,994 --> 01:29:35,588
Here, try this - this might.

1087
01:29:37,274 --> 01:29:39,071
Thank you.

1088
01:29:39,794 --> 01:29:43,503
I will take these.
The days are getting shorter.

1089
01:29:44,514 --> 01:29:46,823
A little tense out, isn't it?

1090
01:29:46,914 --> 01:29:52,386
- Francois, I'm really terrified.
- I know. Try another one of these.

1091
01:29:52,474 --> 01:29:55,591
- But I just had one.
- Trust me. Drink it.

1092
01:29:56,394 --> 01:30:00,433
The secret of these grand parties
is to be natural - helps you relax.

1093
01:30:00,514 --> 01:30:04,223
A few more of these and you will get a feeling
you're in your own cafe.

1094
01:30:04,314 --> 01:30:06,032
Ready, darling?

1095
01:30:06,114 --> 01:30:09,823
- Well, good evening.
- Congratulations. You're a very lucky man.

1096
01:30:09,914 --> 01:30:12,428
Very nice of you to say so.
Will you forgive us?

1097
01:30:12,514 --> 01:30:14,505
Pardon me.

1098
01:30:24,074 --> 01:30:28,226
De Musset, perhaps, or Verlaine.
But Baudelaire, he is no poet.

1099
01:30:28,314 --> 01:30:33,104
''Desire, that guttering candle
under the rump of night'' - it's so effortful.

1100
01:30:33,194 --> 01:30:39,064
- Which poet do you prefer, Miss Pistache?
- Me? Uh, the first one. He's my favourite.

1101
01:30:39,154 --> 01:30:41,714
I agree. Which work?

1102
01:30:42,434 --> 01:30:44,152
Work?

1103
01:30:44,234 --> 01:30:48,352
Oh, I just remembered, I've left my hankie.

1104
01:30:48,434 --> 01:30:50,425
I will be right back.

1105
01:31:09,594 --> 01:31:11,789
- Anything wrong?
- Oh...

1106
01:31:11,874 --> 01:31:13,592
You're jumpy.

1107
01:31:13,674 --> 01:31:16,507
- Francois, I'm desperate.
- What's the matter?

1108
01:31:16,594 --> 01:31:22,305
I don't know. I can't seem to talk
to those people in there. De Musset and Ver...

1109
01:31:22,394 --> 01:31:24,350
- Verlaine?
- Verlaine.

1110
01:31:24,434 --> 01:31:30,270
I never heard of those names.
They must think I'm just a terrible dummy.

1111
01:31:30,354 --> 01:31:33,710
That's because you're trying
to be something you're not.

1112
01:31:33,794 --> 01:31:37,946
- I am a dummy.
- Have a little more wine, dummy.

1113
01:31:38,034 --> 01:31:42,869
I've never had so much to drink in my life.
I don't even feel it.

1114
01:31:42,954 --> 01:31:45,991
You know, these people
are crazy about entertainers.

1115
01:31:46,074 --> 01:31:48,872
They really like performers, really they do.

1116
01:31:48,954 --> 01:31:55,268
I was just thinking, remember the routine
you made up at Yvette's birthday party?

1117
01:31:55,354 --> 01:31:59,666
- It was great. Just great.
- Yvette's birthday party.

1118
01:31:59,754 --> 01:32:03,793
- That was a wonderful party.
- Remember the routine?

1119
01:32:03,874 --> 01:32:08,345
That routine...
I don't think for these people, Francois.

1120
01:32:08,434 --> 01:32:11,187
- Why not?
- Well... Not for these people.

1121
01:32:11,274 --> 01:32:15,313
Would I steer you wrong? Let me
tell you something: I know these people.

1122
01:32:15,394 --> 01:32:18,909
They're probably so bored
that they would love to be entertained.

1123
01:32:18,994 --> 01:32:22,589
You'd have them in the palm of your hand.
You'd own them all.

1124
01:32:22,674 --> 01:32:24,630
Oh, Francois... Really?

1125
01:32:24,714 --> 01:32:27,182
- You scared?
- Scared?

1126
01:32:28,074 --> 01:32:30,542
Have some more courage.

1127
01:32:36,074 --> 01:32:37,792
Well...

1128
01:32:47,074 --> 01:32:51,704
Ladies and gentlemen... If you please,
may I have your attention?

1129
01:32:51,794 --> 01:32:57,073
It is my pleasure to introduce to you
the guest of honour, Mademoiselle Pistache.

1130
01:32:57,154 --> 01:33:00,829
Judge Forrestier's fiancee
would like now to entertain you

1131
01:33:00,914 --> 01:33:03,633
with a number that
I don't believe you've ever seen.

1132
01:33:03,714 --> 01:33:09,152
If you wpll just be seated and make a little
more room, she's ready to entertain you.

1133
01:33:09,234 --> 01:33:11,702
Mademoiselle Pistache.

1134
01:33:20,154 --> 01:33:23,544
# From down to up

1135
01:33:24,154 --> 01:33:27,510
# About this town

1136
01:33:28,154 --> 01:33:31,066
# I've drunk my cup

1137
01:33:32,954 --> 01:33:35,866
# From up to down

1138
01:33:35,954 --> 01:33:40,072
# But being a connoisseur

1139
01:33:40,154 --> 01:33:43,749
# And a great social pet

1140
01:33:44,714 --> 01:33:50,823
# The circle which I prefer

1141
01:33:50,914 --> 01:33:57,183
# Is the dilettante set

1142
01:34:02,314 --> 01:34:05,863
# If you want to pass
through the gilded gates

1143
01:34:05,954 --> 01:34:09,105
# Where the bourgeois
meet the sophisticates

1144
01:34:09,194 --> 01:34:12,789
# To exchange their views
and to compare their mates

1145
01:34:12,874 --> 01:34:16,389
# Come along with me

1146
01:34:20,354 --> 01:34:24,029
# If you'd like to dine with an old marquis

1147
01:34:24,114 --> 01:34:27,151
# Who wpll swear that technically he is free

1148
01:34:27,234 --> 01:34:31,022
# But his wife's the only technicality

1149
01:34:31,114 --> 01:34:34,186
# Come along with me

1150
01:34:38,634 --> 01:34:41,944
# Come along with me, my pretty

1151
01:34:42,034 --> 01:34:45,344
# Let me open your eyes

1152
01:34:45,434 --> 01:34:48,710
# In this great big wicked city

1153
01:34:48,794 --> 01:34:51,672
# It is folly not to be wise

1154
01:34:52,194 --> 01:34:55,470
# And if any night, baby, you would care

1155
01:34:55,554 --> 01:34:58,546
# For an unconventional love affair

1156
01:34:58,634 --> 01:35:02,343
# I will improve your mind
if you will let down your hair

1157
01:35:02,434 --> 01:35:05,665
# Come along, come along

1158
01:35:05,754 --> 01:35:08,348
# Come along with me

1159
01:35:13,274 --> 01:35:16,471
# There's a prince whose home
has become a must

1160
01:35:16,554 --> 01:35:19,705
# For the lower men of the upper crust

1161
01:35:19,794 --> 01:35:23,389
# Cos his high-born wife
has such a low-cut bust

1162
01:35:23,914 --> 01:35:26,792
# Come along with me

1163
01:35:28,034 --> 01:35:31,310
# There's a king who's on the town, dear

1164
01:35:31,394 --> 01:35:34,670
# Who imbibes round the clock

1165
01:35:34,754 --> 01:35:37,951
# He wpll show you his gold crown, dear

1166
01:35:38,034 --> 01:35:40,912
# When he gets his crown out of hock

1167
01:35:44,754 --> 01:35:46,153
Whee!

1168
01:35:47,554 --> 01:35:49,226
Whee!

1169
01:35:57,354 --> 01:36:00,073
# Come along

1170
01:36:00,274 --> 01:36:03,072
# Come along

1171
01:36:03,154 --> 01:36:11,152
# Come along with me!

1172
01:36:39,074 --> 01:36:40,792
Simone.

1173
01:36:40,874 --> 01:36:43,991
Simone, please, don't be upset.

1174
01:36:44,074 --> 01:36:45,268
Simone.

1175
01:36:45,354 --> 01:36:50,030
I will kill him, Philippe.
The minute I see that Francois I will kill him.

1176
01:36:50,114 --> 01:36:52,753
And I will go to the guillotine a happy woman.

1177
01:36:52,834 --> 01:36:56,383
But, Simone, you'd be leaving
a very unhappy man.

1178
01:36:56,474 --> 01:37:01,150
Philippe, you mustn't even talk to me.
I don't deserve to be talked to.

1179
01:37:01,234 --> 01:37:05,227
Oh, Philippe, I disgusted your friends.

1180
01:37:06,034 --> 01:37:08,628
Oh, they were absolutely disgusted.

1181
01:37:08,714 --> 01:37:11,512
Who cares. They disgust me.

1182
01:37:11,594 --> 01:37:14,154
I will break his head open.

1183
01:37:14,234 --> 01:37:18,147
Simone, nothing has happened
that matters the least bit.

1184
01:37:18,234 --> 01:37:22,307
Oh, but Philippe, I humiliated you
right in front of your friends.

1185
01:37:22,394 --> 01:37:26,592
I showed them what a stupid, cheap girl
you want to marry.

1186
01:37:26,674 --> 01:37:30,144
No one's allowed to criticise
Madame Forrestier, not even you.

1187
01:37:30,234 --> 01:37:34,671
But I did. I humiliated you
right in front of your friends.

1188
01:37:34,754 --> 01:37:37,826
Philippe, I don't belong with those people.

1189
01:37:37,914 --> 01:37:44,069
I took this distinguished boat
and I turned it into a cheap, low-class saloon.

1190
01:37:44,154 --> 01:37:48,227
''Distinguished boat.''
That's the most lovable phrase I ever heard.

1191
01:37:48,314 --> 01:37:50,589
I will kill Francois!

1192
01:37:50,674 --> 01:37:53,507
Simone, look at me. Look at me.

1193
01:37:54,514 --> 01:37:57,506
Let's do something better
than killing Francois.

1194
01:37:57,594 --> 01:37:59,983
Let's show him how little he means.

1195
01:38:00,074 --> 01:38:05,546
We will walk back to the salon and let everyone
see how unimportant their opinions are to us.

1196
01:38:05,634 --> 01:38:09,149
I can't go back there again!
I'd never go back there.

1197
01:38:09,234 --> 01:38:11,873
Just smile at them, Simone, just smile,

1198
01:38:11,954 --> 01:38:15,708
and in 20 minutes
they will be drinking toasts to you, believe me.

1199
01:38:15,794 --> 01:38:18,069
Just believe me.

1200
01:38:23,474 --> 01:38:25,510
I will fix my face, then.

1201
01:38:25,594 --> 01:38:27,903
That's my girl.

1202
01:38:27,994 --> 01:38:29,746
Come.

1203
01:38:32,634 --> 01:38:34,465
All right.

1204
01:38:35,474 --> 01:38:38,910
You wait outside.
I will be out in a little while.

1205
01:38:38,994 --> 01:38:41,064
Good.

1206
01:38:41,154 --> 01:38:43,190
I'm proud of you.

1207
01:39:13,674 --> 01:39:16,063
Simone? Simone?

1208
01:39:45,874 --> 01:39:48,024
- Coffee?
- No.

1209
01:39:48,714 --> 01:39:49,908
Cognac?

1210
01:39:49,994 --> 01:39:53,669
She hasn't been to her home,
no one's heard from her since the party.

1211
01:39:53,754 --> 01:39:56,348
She may be dead, Paul!
She might have drowned!

1212
01:39:56,434 --> 01:40:01,030
Don't be dramatic. She feels ashamed
and doesn't want to see people, that's all.

1213
01:40:01,114 --> 01:40:03,912
That doesn't explain her hiding from me.

1214
01:40:03,994 --> 01:40:07,111
A man to see you.
He says he's Andre, the head waiter.

1215
01:40:07,194 --> 01:40:10,550
- Andre? Well, send him in.
- Come in, Andre.

1216
01:40:10,634 --> 01:40:15,310
Good evening, monsieur. Mademoiselle
Pistache asked me to deliver this personally.

1217
01:40:15,394 --> 01:40:17,544
Andre, where is she? Is she all right?

1218
01:40:17,634 --> 01:40:21,866
She is quite all right, sir.
This goes with the letter, sir.

1219
01:40:23,074 --> 01:40:25,144
Andre, wait.

1220
01:40:25,234 --> 01:40:31,582
- Where is Miss Pistache? Please.
- I am not allowed to tell, sir. I'm sorry.

1221
01:40:33,314 --> 01:40:37,910
Well, what does it say?
You can read faster than that.

1222
01:40:37,994 --> 01:40:41,225
''I know you can make Philippe understand.''

1223
01:40:41,314 --> 01:40:49,187
''Please tell him I'm still not a liar,
I'm not cheap and I'm not a thief,

1224
01:40:49,274 --> 01:40:56,703
but I'd be all three if I married him now that
I know what a mistake it would be. Simone.''

1225
01:40:57,514 --> 01:41:04,465
''PS. This is the first piece ofjewellery
I ever returned to a man.''

1226
01:41:07,274 --> 01:41:09,629
That girl has style.

1227
01:41:09,714 --> 01:41:14,344
I don't call that style. You don't break up
because some stuffed shirts snub you -

1228
01:41:14,434 --> 01:41:16,743
not unless you're as big a snob as they are.

1229
01:41:16,834 --> 01:41:20,349
Oh, it's over.
Don't go on torturing yourself.

1230
01:41:21,354 --> 01:41:23,584
I don't know how to stop.

1231
01:41:23,674 --> 01:41:26,472
You're not the first to have that problem.

1232
01:41:26,554 --> 01:41:31,628
# As Madame du Barry once said
to her boyfriend, ''Fare thee well''

1233
01:41:31,714 --> 01:41:35,024
# As Columbus announced
when he knew he was bounced:

1234
01:41:35,114 --> 01:41:37,787
# ''It was swell, Isabelle, swell''

1235
01:41:37,874 --> 01:41:40,468
# As Abelard said to HeIo:i:se:

1236
01:41:40,994 --> 01:41:43,792
# ''Don't forget to drop a line to me, please''

1237
01:41:43,874 --> 01:41:47,628
# As Juliet cried in her Romeo's ear:

1238
01:41:47,714 --> 01:41:51,627
# ''Romeo, why not face the fact, my dear?''

1239
01:41:52,594 --> 01:41:56,109
# ''It was just one of those things''

1240
01:41:56,514 --> 01:42:00,746
# Just one of those crazy filings

1241
01:42:00,834 --> 01:42:04,668
# One of those bells
that now and then rings

1242
01:42:04,754 --> 01:42:08,110
# Just one of those things

1243
01:42:08,194 --> 01:42:11,903
# It was just one of those nights

1244
01:42:12,834 --> 01:42:16,349
# Just one of those fabulous flights

1245
01:42:16,434 --> 01:42:20,825
# A trip to the moon on gossamer wings

1246
01:42:20,914 --> 01:42:24,145
# Just one of those things

1247
01:42:24,234 --> 01:42:28,147
# If you'd thought a bit
of the end of it

1248
01:42:28,234 --> 01:42:32,227
# When you started painting the town

1249
01:42:32,314 --> 01:42:35,943
# You'd have been aware
that your love affair

1250
01:42:36,034 --> 01:42:39,822
# Was too hot not to cool down

1251
01:42:39,914 --> 01:42:43,384
# Say, ''Goodbye, dear, amen''

1252
01:42:44,474 --> 01:42:47,671
# Here's hoping you will meet her again

1253
01:42:47,754 --> 01:42:49,665
# It was great fun

1254
01:42:49,754 --> 01:42:52,746
# But it was just one of those things

1255
01:42:52,834 --> 01:42:55,064
# Just one of those things

1256
01:42:55,154 --> 01:42:56,507
# Poof!

1257
01:42:59,234 --> 01:43:02,909
The plaintiff alleges that...

1258
01:43:04,674 --> 01:43:06,710
Durnais speaking. Hello?

1259
01:43:06,794 --> 01:43:08,785
Oh, Claudine.

1260
01:43:08,874 --> 01:43:10,990
Simone what?

1261
01:43:11,074 --> 01:43:12,746
Well, you needn't yell.

1262
01:43:12,834 --> 01:43:14,825
Simone is on her way to see you.

1263
01:43:14,914 --> 01:43:18,111
I don't like to gossip,
but I think she's going to shoot you.

1264
01:43:18,194 --> 01:43:22,585
- What gave you that idea?
- She did. She said so to Arturo.

1265
01:43:22,674 --> 01:43:24,665
I thought you might be interested.

1266
01:43:24,754 --> 01:43:28,349
Thank you, Claudine. I am, in a way.
Yes, thank you very much.

1267
01:43:28,434 --> 01:43:30,629
Any time, cheri.

1268
01:43:30,714 --> 01:43:32,670
Uh, yes.

1269
01:43:32,754 --> 01:43:35,712
I'm not in to Miss Pistache.
In fact, I'm out of the country.

1270
01:43:35,794 --> 01:43:41,232
Now, you go out and protect you job.
Dead men pay no Christmas bonuses.

1271
01:43:42,234 --> 01:43:45,590
- She's coming in now.
- Has she got a gun?

1272
01:43:45,674 --> 01:43:48,347
Well, maybe. She's carrying a box.

1273
01:43:48,434 --> 01:43:49,833
Go, go, go.

1274
01:43:50,874 --> 01:43:52,193
Good morning.

1275
01:43:52,274 --> 01:43:55,072
I would like to see Monsieur Durnais.
It's important.

1276
01:43:55,154 --> 01:43:57,190
- He's not in.
- I will wait.

1277
01:43:57,274 --> 01:44:00,550
- But he won't be back for a long time.
- I'm in no hurry.

1278
01:44:00,634 --> 01:44:03,228
He's out of the country.

1279
01:44:03,314 --> 01:44:05,874
I don't believe you.

1280
01:44:28,154 --> 01:44:31,430
- Go ahead, shoot.
- Oh, Francois.

1281
01:44:31,514 --> 01:44:34,904
I wold not want to hurt my best friend.

1282
01:44:34,994 --> 01:44:39,590
Well, a little bird told me that you came
over here with homicide on your mind.

1283
01:44:39,674 --> 01:44:44,953
I will admit at first I wanted to
hack off your head, but after a while I...

1284
01:44:45,034 --> 01:44:48,026
- Well, I think it was all for the best.
- Oh.

1285
01:44:48,114 --> 01:44:50,548
Well, what about Philippe?

1286
01:44:50,634 --> 01:44:53,706
I haven't seen him.
We're no longer engaged.

1287
01:44:53,794 --> 01:44:57,104
- Well, congratulations are in order!
- Don't.

1288
01:44:57,194 --> 01:45:01,665
We should be celebrating our getting together
again. This is a big moment, honey-face.

1289
01:45:01,754 --> 01:45:03,665
Don't, Francois.

1290
01:45:03,754 --> 01:45:07,747
- I've decided to do without men for a while.
- You've decided to...

1291
01:45:07,834 --> 01:45:10,189
Oh, that's not my little birdie taking.

1292
01:45:10,274 --> 01:45:14,187
- I didn't say forever.
- Well, then I will be patient.

1293
01:45:14,274 --> 01:45:17,903
I'm concentrating on one thing -
making money.

1294
01:45:17,994 --> 01:45:21,191
Thank heaven.
I thought perhaps you might have changed.

1295
01:45:21,274 --> 01:45:24,425
The Quat'z'Arts Ball committee
called the other day.

1296
01:45:24,514 --> 01:45:28,268
They say if I can handle it,
they will let me give the ball this year.

1297
01:45:28,354 --> 01:45:31,710
Say! That's a big coup.

1298
01:45:31,794 --> 01:45:34,308
I could make a small fortune,
if you'd help me.

1299
01:45:34,394 --> 01:45:36,749
- How much?
- 15,000 francs.

1300
01:45:36,834 --> 01:45:38,233
You got it.

1301
01:45:38,314 --> 01:45:41,670
All right, but I don't want any favours.
Only a business deal.

1302
01:45:41,754 --> 01:45:44,314
What are you making a fuss for?
Just take the money.

1303
01:45:44,394 --> 01:45:46,988
No, a strict business deal.

1304
01:45:47,074 --> 01:45:51,113
This is the deed to my cafe -
security for the loan.

1305
01:45:51,194 --> 01:45:52,786
Why bother with...

1306
01:45:52,874 --> 01:45:56,913
If you don't want to do it my way,
we will just have to forget it.

1307
01:45:56,994 --> 01:45:58,791
OK, we will do it your way.

1308
01:45:58,874 --> 01:46:00,910
Now, if you will sign right there,

1309
01:46:00,994 --> 01:46:05,146
you will hold the title
untiI I can pay back the money.

1310
01:46:05,234 --> 01:46:08,067
- My name is already there.
- Mm-hm.

1311
01:46:10,274 --> 01:46:16,190
You know, since you've been going around
with that judge, you sure got pretty legal.

1312
01:46:16,274 --> 01:46:21,143
I will give this back to you
as soon as I have the change of title recorded.

1313
01:46:21,234 --> 01:46:23,828
Anything you say, sweetheart.

1314
01:46:25,114 --> 01:46:28,026
- There you are.
- Thank you so much.

1315
01:46:29,434 --> 01:46:31,470
Good day, Francois.

1316
01:46:33,234 --> 01:46:36,465
I just wanted to tell you
I'm sorry if you've been unhappy.

1317
01:46:36,554 --> 01:46:37,873
Good.

1318
01:46:37,954 --> 01:46:40,548
Frankly, I want you to be sorry.

1319
01:46:40,634 --> 01:46:42,306
Bye-bye.

1320
01:47:08,434 --> 01:47:11,187
Ladies and gentlemen of the four arts,

1321
01:47:11,274 --> 01:47:13,993
we would like now to present
for your entertainment

1322
01:47:14,074 --> 01:47:17,544
a ballet based on the story
of Adam and Eve.

1323
01:47:17,634 --> 01:47:19,829
''Why Adam and Eve?'' you may ask.

1324
01:47:19,914 --> 01:47:23,987
Well, we chose Adam and Eve because we
would like to remind the police department

1325
01:47:24,074 --> 01:47:29,228
that sin was not invented in Montmartre,
it was only perfected here.

1326
01:47:35,954 --> 01:47:38,070
Splendid, Andre.

1327
01:54:30,394 --> 01:54:31,952
Aaarh!

1328
01:54:51,034 --> 01:54:52,752
Aaarh!

1329
01:56:23,314 --> 01:56:24,349
Hey.

1330
01:56:24,434 --> 01:56:26,664
How's my little French pastry?

1331
01:56:26,754 --> 01:56:29,188
- What do you say? This the night?
- Philippe...

1332
01:56:29,274 --> 01:56:32,983
Biggest bottle I could find, sweetheart.
Bring another glass, huh?

1333
01:56:33,074 --> 01:56:36,350
- Philippe, please go away.
- Hey, wait.

1334
01:56:36,434 --> 01:56:40,712
I brought you a cat. Her name's
the Duchess de Grimont. Like cats?

1335
01:56:41,954 --> 01:56:43,546
She's very cute, but please...

1336
01:56:43,634 --> 01:56:47,752
Better like this cat.
She's got a diamond necklace.

1337
01:56:48,754 --> 01:56:50,870
Oh. It's very pretty.

1338
01:56:50,954 --> 01:56:55,391
Hey, you too can be an animal lover.
Just takes a little coaxing, huh, first prize?

1339
01:56:55,474 --> 01:56:59,467
- What do you say?
- Goodness, I've never seen you drunk before.

1340
01:56:59,554 --> 01:57:03,229
- I'm not drunk.
- Well, you're not yourself.

1341
01:57:03,314 --> 01:57:07,102
Why should I be myself?
You don't like myself.

1342
01:57:07,194 --> 01:57:11,870
You like flip, sophisticated fellows
with a lot of fast answers.

1343
01:57:11,954 --> 01:57:15,913
You like men who know how
to make you laugh, and then treat you badly.

1344
01:57:15,994 --> 01:57:19,509
Well, that isn't so hard to learn.

1345
01:57:19,594 --> 01:57:24,349
Now crawl out of that skin, wpll you?
We're going to thrill the tourists at Maxim's.

1346
01:57:24,434 --> 01:57:27,949
Forget about this ball here - it's rolling.

1347
01:57:29,194 --> 01:57:31,230
What you laughing at, French pastry?

1348
01:57:31,314 --> 01:57:34,704
You sound just like him. You're funny.

1349
01:57:36,554 --> 01:57:40,229
- What's the matter?
- The cat! She's scampered for the pawn shop.

1350
01:57:40,314 --> 01:57:42,305
Hey, cat! Fat cat!

1351
01:57:42,394 --> 01:57:44,862
Where are ya? Fat cat with the loot!

1352
01:57:44,954 --> 01:57:49,027
Ah, there you are, there you are!
Little baby.

1353
01:57:49,874 --> 01:57:55,426
Keep a firm grip on this beast.
It has a message for you, sweetheart.

1354
01:57:57,314 --> 01:57:59,623
Oh, my!

1355
01:57:59,714 --> 01:58:03,946
- Do you know what you just did?
- Sure. Closed the stupid window.

1356
01:58:06,194 --> 01:58:08,662
I think maybe I was wrong about you.

1357
01:58:08,754 --> 01:58:10,585
No argument, birdie.

1358
01:58:10,674 --> 01:58:14,872
Oh, I mean you and me.
It might not be such a bad mistake after all.

1359
01:58:14,954 --> 01:58:17,070
Don't... don't rush me, birdie.

1360
01:58:17,154 --> 01:58:21,545
I mean, if I really make you happy,
then I wold not be wrong for you, would I?

1361
01:58:21,634 --> 01:58:23,511
Yes, sweetheart, you would.

1362
01:58:23,594 --> 01:58:26,472
According to the people that count,
you sure would.

1363
01:58:26,554 --> 01:58:28,385
But who cares!

1364
01:58:28,474 --> 01:58:30,829
# It's the wrong time

1365
01:58:31,474 --> 01:58:33,624
# And the wrong place

1366
01:58:34,354 --> 01:58:36,663
# Though your face is charming

1367
01:58:36,754 --> 01:58:39,314
# It's the wrong face

1368
01:58:39,394 --> 01:58:41,783
# But it's your face

1369
01:58:41,874 --> 01:58:47,232
# And such a charming face

1370
01:58:47,874 --> 01:58:52,026
# That if you might... agree

1371
01:58:53,114 --> 01:58:55,469
# Dear, it's all right

1372
01:58:55,554 --> 01:58:59,672
# Yes, it's all right

1373
01:59:00,394 --> 01:59:05,991
# With me

1374
01:59:10,154 --> 01:59:13,191
Ring-a-ding-ding-ding.

1375
01:59:13,274 --> 01:59:15,424
Let's get out of here, honey.

1376
01:59:15,514 --> 01:59:17,505
All right, Philippe.

1377
01:59:17,594 --> 01:59:20,154
I have something to attend to first, though.

1378
01:59:20,234 --> 01:59:22,589
I will be haIf an hour.
I will meet you at Maxim's.

1379
01:59:22,674 --> 01:59:24,824
You can bet on it, birdie.

1380
01:59:27,594 --> 01:59:29,710
Hey, Eve, about that apple...

1381
01:59:29,794 --> 01:59:32,945
Francois. I hope
you're having a pleasant evening.

1382
01:59:33,034 --> 01:59:36,106
- You do?
- Well, not really.

1383
01:59:38,794 --> 01:59:42,912
He may be long on law,
but he sure is short on charm.

1384
01:59:42,994 --> 01:59:45,269
Hey, who closed this window?

1385
01:59:45,354 --> 01:59:47,072
Philippe.

1386
01:59:54,314 --> 01:59:56,623
Philippe, huh?

1387
01:59:56,714 --> 01:59:59,786
- Now I'm worried.
- You have reason to be worried.

1388
01:59:59,874 --> 02:00:04,265
Look, I'm getting tired of that cold-shoulder
treatment and I decided to take steps.

1389
02:00:04,354 --> 02:00:06,663
Now step number one...

1390
02:00:09,314 --> 02:00:11,703
Darling, it's the mate to the other one.

1391
02:00:11,794 --> 02:00:16,470
Oh, my, Francois! Isn't that loveIy!

1392
02:00:16,554 --> 02:00:19,307
- Oh, thank you!
- I knew you'd like it.

1393
02:00:19,394 --> 02:00:22,113
That's loveIy. You're going to be arrested.

1394
02:00:22,194 --> 02:00:25,425
- Isn't that pretty?
- I love it. Thank you.

1395
02:00:25,514 --> 02:00:27,186
I'm going to be what?

1396
02:00:27,274 --> 02:00:30,232
Arrested. In 30 seconds.
I've made all the arrangements.

1397
02:00:30,314 --> 02:00:34,592
Oh, you poor girl, your mind's crumbing.
It's the strain of keeping away from me.

1398
02:00:34,674 --> 02:00:37,984
- Remember that deed you signed?
- Yes. What about it?

1399
02:00:38,074 --> 02:00:42,431
Well, when you signed that deed you became
the proprietor of this establishment.

1400
02:00:42,514 --> 02:00:46,792
Now, when I go out and tell Arturo
to start the cancan, this place wpll be raided.

1401
02:00:46,874 --> 02:00:51,629
I know because I fixed it with the police.
Now, the police usually arrest the proprietor.

1402
02:00:51,714 --> 02:00:56,344
And you, dear sweet darling Francois,
are the proprietor.

1403
02:00:56,434 --> 02:00:58,584
You wold not do a thing like that.

1404
02:00:58,674 --> 02:01:01,632
No, not for about another ten seconds.

1405
02:01:01,714 --> 02:01:06,310
Look, this is not just a weekend in jail
or a fine. I could be disbarred.

1406
02:01:06,394 --> 02:01:08,430
Ha! I know. Excuse me.

1407
02:01:08,514 --> 02:01:13,429
Wait a minute. I know I've been a little rough
on you - cos I didn't want to lose you.

1408
02:01:13,514 --> 02:01:15,948
That's where we differ.
I do want to lose you.

1409
02:01:16,034 --> 02:01:18,753
Wait a minute!
You're not giving any signals tonight!

1410
02:01:18,834 --> 02:01:21,029
The hell I'm not!

1411
02:01:21,714 --> 02:01:23,625
Simone!

1412
02:01:23,714 --> 02:01:25,989
Simone! Simone!

1413
02:01:30,914 --> 02:01:32,791
Help.

1414
02:01:42,434 --> 02:01:44,186
Call the first case.

1415
02:01:44,274 --> 02:01:47,346
The City of Paris versus Francois Durnais.

1416
02:01:48,594 --> 02:01:50,585
Monsieur Durnais.

1417
02:01:59,074 --> 02:02:02,430
May it please the court,
I ask permission to act as my own attorney.

1418
02:02:02,514 --> 02:02:04,709
May I remind you, Monsieur Durnais,

1419
02:02:04,794 --> 02:02:08,992
that an attorney who represents himself
is said to have a fool for a client.

1420
02:02:09,074 --> 02:02:14,751
Thank you, Your Honour, but I still believe
that it is better than having a fool for a lawyer.

1421
02:02:14,834 --> 02:02:16,233
No objection.

1422
02:02:16,314 --> 02:02:20,705
Your Honour, Monsieur Paul Barriere,
the eminent president of the court,

1423
02:02:20,794 --> 02:02:26,187
has abstained from sitting today so that he
might give testimony as a character witness.

1424
02:02:26,874 --> 02:02:30,025
I call Monsieur Barriere to the stand.

1425
02:02:31,954 --> 02:02:35,708
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth?

1426
02:02:35,794 --> 02:02:38,103
I do.

1427
02:02:38,194 --> 02:02:45,191
Monsieur, wpll you tell the court what
you know of the character of the defendant?

1428
02:02:47,834 --> 02:02:54,069
Monsieur le President, Your Honours,
I have known the defendant for many years.

1429
02:02:54,154 --> 02:02:58,147
He is an excellent lawyer,
a credit to his profession,

1430
02:02:58,234 --> 02:03:00,225
and a good good friend.

1431
02:03:01,794 --> 02:03:05,753
Whether or not he's guilty technically,

1432
02:03:05,834 --> 02:03:10,350
I ask the court to bear in mind
that a sentence of guilty

1433
02:03:10,434 --> 02:03:14,666
would automatically result
in his professional ruin.

1434
02:03:14,754 --> 02:03:20,033
And I do not think the city of Paris
is so rich in legal talent

1435
02:03:20,114 --> 02:03:27,668
that it can so casually lose the services
of a gifted and honourable attorney.

1436
02:03:28,514 --> 02:03:29,913
Thank you.

1437
02:03:30,834 --> 02:03:34,543
The court is grateful
to have Judge Barriere's opinion.

1438
02:03:34,634 --> 02:03:38,673
And the defendant thanks you, Your Honour.

1439
02:03:41,034 --> 02:03:44,390
I would like to call
Mademoiselle Pistache to the stand.

1440
02:03:44,474 --> 02:03:46,590
Mademoiselle Pistache.

1441
02:03:49,394 --> 02:03:52,943
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth?

1442
02:03:53,034 --> 02:03:54,752
I do.

1443
02:03:54,834 --> 02:03:57,712
- Your name?
- Simone.

1444
02:03:57,794 --> 02:04:01,104
- You have a last name?
- Of course. You know I have a last name.

1445
02:04:01,194 --> 02:04:03,469
May the court hear it?

1446
02:04:03,554 --> 02:04:05,863
Simone Pistache.

1447
02:04:05,954 --> 02:04:09,742
Are you the Simone Pistache
who owns the Bal du Paradis?

1448
02:04:09,834 --> 02:04:11,790
No, I'm not.

1449
02:04:11,874 --> 02:04:14,149
Oh, that is a different Simone Pistache?

1450
02:04:14,234 --> 02:04:17,624
If there's another Simone Pistache,
I don't know her. I don't see...

1451
02:04:17,714 --> 02:04:19,944
If my questions confuse you...

1452
02:04:20,034 --> 02:04:23,743
I am not confused!
You haven't asked me anything intelligent.

1453
02:04:25,754 --> 02:04:28,222
I wpll begin again.

1454
02:04:28,314 --> 02:04:31,670
Which Simone Pistache
do you state you now are?

1455
02:04:31,754 --> 02:04:35,064
The one who, until four days ago,
owned the Bal du Paradis,

1456
02:04:35,154 --> 02:04:38,351
at which time
it was taken over by another party.

1457
02:04:38,434 --> 02:04:41,949
- ''Taken over''? You mean bought?
- No.

1458
02:04:42,034 --> 02:04:45,470
Oh, you gave it away as a gift?

1459
02:04:45,554 --> 02:04:47,226
No.

1460
02:04:47,314 --> 02:04:51,227
- Well, perhaps you put it up as collateral?
- What does that mean?

1461
02:04:51,314 --> 02:04:53,908
It means a pledged of payment.

1462
02:04:54,394 --> 02:04:55,383
Oh.

1463
02:04:58,354 --> 02:05:02,267
Let us say that you needed
a great deal of money desperately.

1464
02:05:02,354 --> 02:05:06,063
And let us say there was a young man
who loved you very much.

1465
02:05:06,154 --> 02:05:12,070
And this young man was eager to lend you
the money for no more collateral than a smile.

1466
02:05:12,754 --> 02:05:18,306
But you said, ''No, monsieur, I refuse.
You must accept the cafe as security.''

1467
02:05:18,394 --> 02:05:24,151
And this young man, rendered witless by
his affections for you, accepted your terms.

1468
02:05:24,234 --> 02:05:28,113
Monsieur Durnais,
your supposition is not a question.

1469
02:05:28,194 --> 02:05:30,025
It isn't a supposition either.

1470
02:05:30,114 --> 02:05:33,186
The court is not interested
in why you own the cafe.

1471
02:05:33,274 --> 02:05:36,266
It merely wants to learn
whether or not you do.

1472
02:05:36,354 --> 02:05:42,270
Miss Pistache, if there is a deed
giving title to Monsieur Durnais,

1473
02:05:42,354 --> 02:05:44,743
may the court see it?

1474
02:05:45,754 --> 02:05:47,790
Oh, the deed...

1475
02:05:47,874 --> 02:05:50,388
You have such a deed?

1476
02:05:50,474 --> 02:05:52,783
The deed... Um...

1477
02:05:52,874 --> 02:05:54,865
Do you have the deed?

1478
02:05:56,594 --> 02:05:59,108
- No.
- What?

1479
02:05:59,194 --> 02:06:01,867
No. I lost it.

1480
02:06:01,954 --> 02:06:05,424
- When did this happen?
- Just now.

1481
02:06:05,514 --> 02:06:10,793
I just remembered, I lost it
on my way running to catch a carriage.

1482
02:06:15,274 --> 02:06:18,311
I move that the case
against Francois Durnais be...

1483
02:06:18,394 --> 02:06:20,146
Just a moment.

1484
02:06:20,234 --> 02:06:25,911
Miss Pistache, is there a chance
of your finding the lost document?

1485
02:06:27,274 --> 02:06:29,026
Uh...

1486
02:06:29,114 --> 02:06:34,142
No, Your Honour. No. Once I make up
my mind to lose something, I never find it.

1487
02:06:34,634 --> 02:06:38,388
You haven't forgotten that you're under oath?

1488
02:06:38,474 --> 02:06:41,432
I always tell the truth, Your Honour.

1489
02:06:42,314 --> 02:06:44,225
Well, except...

1490
02:06:45,274 --> 02:06:47,071
Except?

1491
02:06:47,154 --> 02:06:51,705
Well, sometimes it takes a little while
to learn what the truth is.

1492
02:06:52,674 --> 02:06:54,505
I see.

1493
02:06:56,114 --> 02:06:58,674
That is all.

1494
02:06:58,754 --> 02:07:03,191
I move that the case against Francois Durnais
be dismissed due to lack of evidence.

1495
02:07:03,514 --> 02:07:05,505
Motion granted. Case dismissed.

1496
02:07:05,594 --> 02:07:08,028
- Your Honour!
- Yes, madame?

1497
02:07:08,114 --> 02:07:12,949
The fact remains that this vile dance
was performed at the Bal du Paradis,

1498
02:07:13,034 --> 02:07:15,707
and whoever is guilty must be punished!

1499
02:07:15,794 --> 02:07:18,752
- May I intervene, Your Honour?
- By all means.

1500
02:07:19,874 --> 02:07:23,184
Madame, have you ever seen the cancan?

1501
02:07:23,274 --> 02:07:25,105
Why, certainly not!

1502
02:07:25,194 --> 02:07:30,587
Well, then may I suggest that the court
adjourn to the Bal du Paradis this evening

1503
02:07:30,674 --> 02:07:34,383
and take an official look at... at the crime?

1504
02:07:34,474 --> 02:07:38,592
An excellent suggestion.
Court is adjourned.

1505
02:08:33,554 --> 02:08:35,351
Yiii-ha!

1506
02:10:30,554 --> 02:10:31,987
Aaarhh!

1507
02:10:37,314 --> 02:10:39,305
Well, what's the verdict?

1508
02:10:39,394 --> 02:10:42,352
- Are you offended in any way?
- Do you still want to ban it?

1509
02:10:42,434 --> 02:10:44,072
Ban it?

1510
02:10:44,154 --> 02:10:47,066
- I want to learn it!
- I will teach you!

1511
02:10:47,154 --> 02:10:51,352
- A toast to Madame la President!
- Madame la President!

1512
02:10:51,434 --> 02:10:53,390
Merci, merci.

1513
02:11:01,354 --> 02:11:04,073
Pardon me. I will be right back.

1514
02:11:06,474 --> 02:11:07,463
Yes?

1515
02:11:07,554 --> 02:11:10,626
Mademoiselle, wpll you please
step outside for a moment?

1516
02:11:10,714 --> 02:11:12,432
What for?

1517
02:11:12,514 --> 02:11:14,823
It wpll save embarrassment.

1518
02:11:14,914 --> 02:11:18,190
All right. But no free drinks -
that performance was legal.

1519
02:11:18,274 --> 02:11:20,344
Thank you.

1520
02:11:20,434 --> 02:11:22,152
Now, what is it?

1521
02:11:22,234 --> 02:11:25,749
Mademoiselle,
we have a warrant for your arrest.

1522
02:11:25,834 --> 02:11:28,064
- Arrest?!
- Come along.

1523
02:11:28,154 --> 02:11:32,306
Wait a minute!
I told you, it was legal tonight!

1524
02:11:32,394 --> 02:11:35,670
- Andre! Andre!
- Get in there.

1525
02:11:36,834 --> 02:11:39,587
Andre, I want Francois!

1526
02:11:39,674 --> 02:11:42,234
This service quick enough for you?

1527
02:11:42,314 --> 02:11:44,953
They get you too? What's the charge?

1528
02:11:45,554 --> 02:11:48,705
It will cost me about 2,000,
including this wagon.

1529
02:11:48,794 --> 02:11:52,469
- What wpll?
- For rigging a false arrest.

1530
02:11:52,554 --> 02:11:54,590
I will smash you, Francois!

1531
02:11:54,674 --> 02:11:59,543
- One of these days I will smash you!
- Simone... Stop screaming at me.

1532
02:11:59,634 --> 02:12:01,625
Now listen to me.

1533
02:12:01,714 --> 02:12:05,707
You were in a lot of trouble a second ago
and you called for me, didn't you?

1534
02:12:05,794 --> 02:12:09,912
Now, I love you, Simone. I truly love you.
Now please forgive me.

1535
02:12:09,994 --> 02:12:14,067
- Oh, you don't love me!
- I'm willing to make it legal.

1536
02:12:14,154 --> 02:12:19,103
You don't love me now, you never have
loved me, and you're going to go on like...

1537
02:12:20,154 --> 02:12:21,906
You what?

1538
02:12:23,074 --> 02:12:27,352
Francois, honesty?
You mean you want to marry me?

1539
02:12:28,394 --> 02:12:31,227
No, I thought I'd just adopt you.

1540
02:12:34,434 --> 02:12:36,265
You miserable...

1541
02:12:36,354 --> 02:12:41,109
# I love Paris every moment

1542
02:12:42,594 --> 02:12:50,990
# Because my love is near

1543
02:13:04,914 --> 02:13:06,905
