1
00:00:14,898 --> 00:00:18,902
Something familiar
Something peculiar

2
00:00:19,402 --> 00:00:22,905
Something for everyone
A comedy tonight

3
00:00:22,906 --> 00:00:26,910
Something appealing
Something appalling

4
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,914
Something for everyone
A comedy tonight

5
00:00:30,914 --> 00:00:34,918
Nothing for kings
Nothing for crowns

6
00:00:34,918 --> 00:00:38,922
Bring on the lovers
Liars and clowns

7
00:00:38,922 --> 00:00:42,926
Old situations
New complications

8
00:00:42,926 --> 00:00:46,930
Nothing portentous
Or polite

9
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,433
Tragedy tomorrow
Comedy tonight

10
00:00:53,436 --> 00:00:57,440
Something convulsive
Something repulsive

11
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,444
Something for everyone
A comedy tonight

12
00:01:01,444 --> 00:01:05,448
Something aesthetic
Something frenetic

13
00:01:05,448 --> 00:01:09,452
Something for everyone
A comedy tonight

14
00:01:09,452 --> 00:01:12,955
Nothing of gods
Nothing of fate

15
00:01:13,456 --> 00:01:17,460
Weighty affairs
Will just have to wait

16
00:01:18,962 --> 00:01:22,465
Our principal
Characters live...

17
00:01:22,465 --> 00:01:24,467
On this street...

18
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:27,970
In a less-fashionable suburb
Of Rome in these three houses.

19
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:30,973
First, the house
Of Erronius,

20
00:01:31,474 --> 00:01:33,476
A befuddled old man,
Abroad now...

21
00:01:33,476 --> 00:01:36,979
In search of his children
Stolen in infancy by pirates.

22
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,483
Something erratic
Something dramatic

23
00:01:40,984 --> 00:01:44,988
Something for everyone
A comedy tonight

24
00:01:44,988 --> 00:01:46,990
Second, the house
Of Lycus,

25
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,993
A buyer and seller
Of the flesh of beautiful women.

26
00:01:49,993 --> 00:01:53,496
That's for those of you
Who have absolutely no interest in pirates.

27
00:01:53,496 --> 00:01:55,498
Something for everyone

28
00:01:55,498 --> 00:01:57,500
A comedy tonight

29
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,002
And, finally,
The house of Senex,

30
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:02,505
Who lives here
With his wife and son.

31
00:02:02,505 --> 00:02:05,508
Also in this house
Dwells Pseudolus, slave to his son.

32
00:02:05,508 --> 00:02:08,511
Pseudolus is probably
My favorite character in the piece.

33
00:02:09,012 --> 00:02:11,014
A role of enormous variety
And nuance...

34
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:13,516
And played by an actor
Of such versatility,

35
00:02:13,516 --> 00:02:15,518
Such magnificent range,
Such--

36
00:02:15,518 --> 00:02:18,521
Let me put it this way.
I play the part.

37
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:22,525
Something familiar
Something peculiar

38
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:26,529
Something for everyone
A comedy tonight

39
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:30,032
Something that's gaudy
Something that's bawdy

40
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:34,037
Something for
Everybody's taste

41
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:37,540
Pantaloons and tunics
Courtesans and eunuchs

42
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,544
Funerals and chases
Baritones and basses

43
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:43,045
Panderers
Philanderers

44
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:45,048
Cupidity
Timidity

45
00:02:45,048 --> 00:02:47,050
Mistakes, fakes
Rhymes, mimes

46
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,551
Tumblers, grumblers
Bumblers

47
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:52,555
No royal curse
No Trojan horse

48
00:02:52,555 --> 00:02:56,559
And there's a happy ending
Of course

49
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:59,562
Goodness and badness
Man in his madness

50
00:02:59,562 --> 00:03:04,066
This time it all turns out
All right

51
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:05,568
Tragedy tomorrow

52
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:08,071
Comedy, comedy, comedy
Comedy, comedy

53
00:03:08,071 --> 00:03:10,573
Comedy, comedy
Comedy, comedy

54
00:03:10,573 --> 00:03:18,581
Tonight

55
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,035
[ shouting ]

56
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,538
[ chattering ]
You boy, why are we stopping? hurry up.

57
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,040
Oh, my dear and noble neighbors,
My deepest apologies.

58
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:33,045
Since moving in next door,
I'm afraid I've been remiss in not calling to pay my respects.

59
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,549
However,
It is our inaugural week, and you know what that is.

60
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,552
I certainly do not.
Move on!

61
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:44,056
[ sighs ]
All right, don't stand. Move, move!

62
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:49,061
A common flesh peddler
In the house next to ours-- disgusting.

63
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,565
Disgraceful.
All that revolting flesh... just next door.

64
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,568
<i>Make way for the house
Of Senex. hail, Senex.  wait!</i>

65
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,072
Wait.
Is this not Pseudolus, your slave?

66
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,074
He was parading
As a citizen. believe me, mistress.

67
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:06,579
<i>I was not parading.
I was walking humbly, like a slave.</i>

68
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:10,082
He invited us to game with him.
In a matter of moments, he cheated us out of nine minae.

69
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,085
- nine?  I took seven.
- return nine.

70
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,588
One, two, three, four--

71
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,090
- I'm being cheated out of
The money I won fairly. - Pseudolus.

72
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,094
Seven, eight--
What happened to five and six?

73
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,097
I'm coming to them.
Nine, five, six. thank you, citizens.

74
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,098
Do not fear.
He will be punished.

75
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,601
Farewell.
Farewell.

76
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:34,106
- now--
- I know.  I should be whipped... gently.

77
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,610
However, good mistress, my
Intentions were of the noblest. hearing that today...

78
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,112
You were visiting
Your dear mother-- may the gods bless her--

79
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,615
I wanted to purchase
An appropriate remembrance--

80
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,117
Some bath essence,
A new spear.

81
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:49,122
Fifty more lashes for lying.
You are doing what you are always doing:

82
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,624
Seeking money to buy
Your freedom.

83
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:55,127
Freedom?  oh, madame,
Who would want to be free of you?

84
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,630
Who indeed?
Hysterium!

85
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,633
My mistress calls?
Slave in chief,

86
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,636
Drag this man home
And beat him without mercy.

87
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,638
I shall be brutal.
Good.

88
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,641
Up!  we go to buy
A breeder slave.

89
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:12,144
Attend to him, Hysterium,
My slave of slaves.

90
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:16,149
I live to grovel.
I shall lash him to pulp.

91
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,652
I shall wear out eight whips.
Strong men will blanch. my arm will--

92
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,659
[ man ]
Now come along now, gentlemen. they're all from gaul and all--

93
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,662
You, sir!
And you!

94
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,165
Come along now, gents.
Now, they're all fresh as the day.

95
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,167
Only one owner.
Don't waste my time. I'm only here--

96
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,671
No?  try Fertilla,
The populator.

97
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,673
Three hundred pounds
Of fertile flesh.

98
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,676
Has produced
18 healthy little slaves...

99
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:47,179
And is capable of producing
18 more.

100
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,183
Mm.
You won't regret it.

101
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:03,162
Oh!  it is time
We were gone.

102
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:05,164
Senex!

103
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,168
Hysterium!

104
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,672
Ah, here you are,
And there I am.

105
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,675
A gift for my mother
On the anniversary of her birth.

106
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,177
A hundred and four years old
And not a single organ in working condition.

107
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:21,680
Do you think
It will please her? the craftsmanship is superb.

108
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:23,683
And the likeness?
Frightening.

109
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:27,687
We go.  Hysterium,
Here are my husband's final instructions.

110
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:33,192
Watch over our son, hero.
Keep him cheerful, well fed and far from the opposite sex.

111
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,194
Oh, but, my dear,
He must learn some time.

112
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:38,697
And when that time comes,
You shall teach him... what little you know.

113
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:42,201
Above all, do not let his eyes
Stray to that house next door.

114
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:44,203
I hold you
Completely responsible.

115
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,706
Rather than let you down,
I would die.

116
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,208
<i>That is what I had in mind.
and furthermore--</i>

117
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,210
We are on our way.
We are on our way.

118
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,713
Come, Senex.
And carry my bust with pride.

119
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,216
Yes, dear.

120
00:06:57,216 --> 00:07:01,220
A lesson to remember: never fall
In love during a total eclipse. thank you, sir.

121
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,722
Where is hero?

122
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,225
He's in his room, I think,
Studying with his tutor.

123
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:10,730
"the sun and the moon
Revolve around the earth...

124
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,232
"as do the four planets.

125
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:17,737
"above all, there is
A great blue bowl, which is the sky.

126
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,739
There are many stars--"

127
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:23,242
[ woman ]
"...is capable of much curious pleasure among which is...

128
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:26,745
The soft brushing of a flower
On quivering skin."

129
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,749
[ tutor ]
"many stars have been named by the egyptian astronomers,

130
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:34,754
And we have developed
Our modern system of astronomy from the Greeks."

131
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:38,257
Who, as you know,
Were very poor scholars.

132
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,262
"the earth is
A flat platform of ground...

133
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,764
And meets the blue bowl
At the end of the world--" take this message of my love...

134
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:48,768
To she who has captured
My heart.

135
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,312
That breeder woman--
Has she been thrown a mate yet?

136
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,815
Alas, she refuses
Just any slave. she demands to choose.

137
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,819
Choose?  she'll breed
And like it, like everyone else. well, almost everyone.

138
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,322
Citizens, we caught
Your runaway slave.

139
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,825
Now, he dare challenge
Our right to execute him. because I'm a family slave!

140
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,329
What's the good of belonging
To a family if you are going to be executed by strangers?

141
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,331
He is quite correct.
We shall torture him.

142
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,834
- you see how they look
After their own? - hold you tongue!

143
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,336
Thank you, officer.

144
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,339
Now, what can we devise?

145
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,341
Something suitable
And lingering.

146
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,342
<i>Madame, may I suggest--
you may not.</i>

147
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,845
[ Senex ]  hang the poor wretch
And have done. hanging is too good for him.

148
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,847
Much too good.
By the feet?

149
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,849
That doesn't hurt much.

150
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,853
Hanging by the feet,
Upside down, while being lashed. they hate that.

151
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,855
They should hate that.
My dear lady,

152
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,357
If I suggest that we try
To find some other method,

153
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,861
It is only because
I happen to be completely impervious to physical pain.

154
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,865
And I can't stand the thought
Of spoiling your pleasure.

155
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,872
I thought you were
Completely impervious to pain? not my own.

156
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,374
Ah!
You like him?

157
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,377
I like him.
You have him.

158
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,379
Congratulations, Pseudolus,
Your life has been spared.

159
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,882
May it be long, healthy
And productive.

160
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:13,886
Productive?  the breeder?
Hang me.

161
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,889
This is your house.
Come, come.

162
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,391
Well, visit at any time,
Dear neighbor.

163
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:23,896
No obligation to buy.
Just come in and browse. Senex!

164
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:27,399
- oh.
- come away from that house of shame.

165
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,402
I was only just standing here
And saying, "shame, shame."

166
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:36,408
For your own good, Hysterium,
Look after hero.

167
00:09:48,304 --> 00:09:50,806
Oh!

168
00:09:52,808 --> 00:09:54,309
Shh!

169
00:09:59,815 --> 00:10:04,319
What brings you up here?
I was trying to get in--

170
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,325
In there?  you must never know
What goes on in that house. but I do know.

171
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:13,329
You do?
Isn't it amazing?

172
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:15,331
Pseudolus,
I'm in love.

173
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:18,334
Well, that's very--
In love?  you?

174
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:22,838
Who is she?
Sometimes, you can see her in that window.

175
00:10:22,838 --> 00:10:26,341
A common courtesan
In the house of Lycus?

176
00:10:26,342 --> 00:10:29,845
Is that disgraceful?
There's no way to make it sound like an achievement.

177
00:10:29,845 --> 00:10:33,348
I don't care.
I would give anything for her. anything.

178
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:35,851
- you really love that girl?
- [ whimpers ]

179
00:10:35,851 --> 00:10:39,855
I like the way you said that.
Master hero, you cannot buy her.

180
00:10:39,855 --> 00:10:42,357
At your age,
You're not allowed to buy her.

181
00:10:42,358 --> 00:10:45,361
But suppose someone with
Tremendous cunning and guile...

182
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:47,863
- could arrange for her
To be yours. - yes?

183
00:10:47,863 --> 00:10:50,866
If that someone
Could arrange it, what would you give me?

184
00:10:50,866 --> 00:10:53,869
I will give you
Everything I own.

185
00:10:53,869 --> 00:10:57,873
Well, what do you own?
Twenty minae, a collection of sea shells and me.

186
00:10:58,374 --> 00:11:01,877
<i>- yes.
- forget about the minae and the sea shells.</i>

187
00:11:01,877 --> 00:11:03,879
Just give me me.

188
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:06,381
- give you you?
- my freedom.

189
00:11:06,382 --> 00:11:10,386
Pseudolus,
People do not go around freeing slaves every day.

190
00:11:10,386 --> 00:11:12,888
Be the first,
Start a fashion.

191
00:11:12,888 --> 00:11:15,390
Get me that girl.

192
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:19,395
- and if I do?
- you are free.

193
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:23,399
- I am what?
- free.

194
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,818
Free!

195
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:43,002
If I've told you once,
I've told you a hundred times:

196
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,004
Do not fan the girls
When they're wet.

197
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:49,008
But you'll never learn.
You'll be a eunuch all your life.

198
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:16,535
I know that sound,
And I love it.

199
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,037
Yuck, you!

200
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:22,541
How did you come into money?
An unexpected legacy.

201
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,544
My uncle Simo, the noted
Carthaginian elephant breeder,

202
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,046
Came to an untimely end.

203
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:31,050
He was crushed to death
On the last day of the mating season.

204
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:35,554
This morning,
I bought my freedom. congratulations, citizen.

205
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:38,557
With this much left over
For one gross indulgence.

206
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:42,561
Lycus, I am in the market
For a lifetime companion.

207
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:46,565
I say with all due modesty,
I have an assortment of beauty here second to none, and--

208
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,567
Who?

209
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:52,571
My former young master.
Thought I'd bring him along to further his education.

210
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:56,074
He's bored with picture books.
You understand?

211
00:12:56,075 --> 00:13:01,080
Who better than i?
Come in, little boy, won't you?

212
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,083
Eunuchs!  quickly!
A buyer!

213
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,595
Was 1 a good year?

214
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:19,097
And now,
For your assured approval and possible purchase,

215
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,600
From out of the east,
With the face of an idol,

216
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,603
The arms of a willow tree,
The pelvis of a camel,

217
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:27,105
Tintinabula.

218
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:12,150
- is this the one?
- no.

219
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:15,153
Don't you have any one in there
A bit less noisy?

220
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:21,159
I have Vibrata, a desert bloom
Of indescribable beauty.

221
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,662
Lithe as a tigress,
Wondrous as a flamingo...

222
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,665
For a man whose interest is
The wild life. thank you.

223
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,711
- no.
- [ grunts ]

224
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:17,215
Frankly, I was hoping to live
Past my wedding night. she seems a bit too--

225
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,718
No matter.
I understand.

226
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:22,220
Consider the gemini,
A matched pair.

227
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:25,724
Look at them, gentlemen.
Either one, a divinely assembled woman.

228
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:30,228
Together, an infinite number
Of mathematical possibilities.

229
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,253
No.

230
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:58,257
I'm a man of limited means,
And I don't suppose you'd want to break up a set.

231
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,259
I couldn't.
You do understand?

232
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:05,263
Completely.  do go on...
And on and on...

233
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:08,267
And on and on and on.

234
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,269
[ Lycus ]
And on.  I know what you want.

235
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,771
Behold!  panacea!

236
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:16,274
Panacea, whose face holds
A thousand promises and a body...

237
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:19,277
That stands
Behind each promise.

238
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,801
No.

239
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:03,822
Don't misunderstand me.
It's the proportions.  I love the breadth.  it's the length.

240
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:06,324
Now she may be the right length,
But is she right for me?

241
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:09,327
If you see what I mean.
Isn't she a bit too short?

242
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,830
- definitely not.
- too tall?

243
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,333
No.  that way,
You're perfect together.

244
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,336
Yes, but how often
Will we find ourselves in this position?

245
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,838
No need to compromise.

246
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,843
<i>my final offering--
Gymnasia, the silent woman.</i>

247

<i>a giant stage upon which
a thousand dramas may be played.</i>

248
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:46,364
You can actually speak
With her? whilst a child,

249
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,867
I had a nurse
From the isle of silent women.

250
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:53,872
May I have
My foot back, please? oh, you poor child.

251
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:58,376
Pseudolus!  do you want
Your freedom? yes, darling?

252
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:01,880
More than ever.
I'll take her. that's not the one.

253
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,383
But yours isn't here.  it's
Not nice to walk out of a place without buying something.

<i>I want my girl.

255
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,888
Gentlemen,
If you must squabble, do it in a place of less character.

256
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:14,392
I know your type-- shoppers.
On your way out, please, don't touch the merchandise.

257
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:17,896
It shows every little mark.
Courtesans! back to your quarters.

258
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:21,399
I'll be back to lead you
In noonday prayers.  move. do you mind?  out!

259
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,902
Please, quickly, out.
Both of you, go!

00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,938
<i>quickly, out, out!
there she is.</i>

<i>who?  what?
one moment, Marcus Lycus.</i>

262
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,943
Did I not just spy a golden head
With a pair of sky-blue eyes wafting down yon balcony?

263
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,948
Oh, that one?  a recent arrival
From Crete, a virgin. a virgin.

264
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,950
Is that good?

265
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,953
<i>only today she was sold.

266
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,957
Then receive, O bosom,
Thy fatal blade.

267

Behave yourself.
She was sold?

268
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,464
Yes, to the agents
Of a great roman captain. he claims her this very day.

269
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,466
- today?
- she cost 500 minae.

270
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,970
Then receive, o bosom, thy--
Put your bosom away.

You say she just arrived
From crete? yes.

272
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,977
I hope the great captain
Is kind to her.  she deserves a bit of affection before--

00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,980
<i>- tragic, is it not?
- w-what?  w-w-what's tragic?</i>

- the news from crete.
- what news?

275
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,486
Why should I darken your day?
Farewell, Lycus.

276
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,488
What is the news?
What news?

277
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,491
The news from crete.
You force me to tell you.

278
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,493
Crete is being ravaged
By a great plague.

279
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,495
People are dying
By the thousands.

280
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,498
But this girl is healthy.
She goes smiling through the day.

281
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,501
She doesn't.
I thought you knew:  when they start to smile, the end is near.

282
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,003
- no?
- yes.  I'm told it is lovely now in crete.

- did you ever see a plague that wasn't?

Oh, well, what about
My other girls?

00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,514
You best get her
Out of here. yes!

287

Yes.
But where?  how?

288
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,518
I could take care of her
Until the captain arrives. yes, he could.

Go.  don't touch that pillar. go, go.

And I shall not forget this.

For you, Pseudolus, are a true friend.

That you're going to run away
To marry her. but won't I catch the plague?

305
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:48,046
There is no plague.
We made that up so as to get her out of there.

Oh, that was clever of us.
Wasn't it?

At night.

Only from the waist up.
It's a very high window. oh.

Is that a lot of money? yes.

Doesn't expect me to do a lot of adding.

00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,649
Radiant as in some

332
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:37,656
Dream come true

333
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:40,659
Oh

334
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:44,162
Isn't it a shame

335
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:47,665
I can neither sew
Nor cook

336
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:52,671
Nor read
Nor write my name

337
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:58,176
But I'm happy

338
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:02,180
Merely being lovely

339
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:07,686
For it's the one thing
I can give

340
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:12,691
To you

341
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,693
Philia, say my name.

342
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,695
Just say your name?
Yes!

343
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:22,200
Very well then.
I've forgotten it.

344
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:27,205
It's hero.
Oh, forgive me, hero.

345
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:29,207
I've no memory for names.

346
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,711
You don't need one.
You don't need anything.

347
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:39,217
You're lovely

348
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:43,221
Absolutely lovely

349
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:47,225
Who'd believe
The loveliness

350
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:51,229
Of you

351
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:53,231
Winsome

352
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:57,735
Sweet and warm and winsome

353
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:00,739
Radiant as in some

354
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:06,244
Dream come true

355
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:11,249
Now, venus would seem tame

356
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:15,253
Helen and her
Thousand ships

357
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:19,758
Would have to die
Of shame

358
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:25,764
[ together ]
And I'm happy

359
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:29,768
Happy that you're lovely
Happy that I'm lovely

360
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:38,276
For there's one thing
Loveliness can do

361
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:42,781
It's a gift for me

362
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:45,783
To share

363
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:50,788
With you

364
00:24:56,294 --> 00:25:00,798
Psst, psst, master hero,
Put that down.

365
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,302
Hysterium,
This is Philia.

366
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:09,307
Never mind who she is.
Who is she? where did you find her?

367
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:12,811
In the house of Lycus.
[ gasping ] a courtesan.  no!

368
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:15,313
Oh, I am a virgin.
Of course.

369
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,815
Master hero, bid farewell
To this, uh, person,

370
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:20,318
So that she can go
About her, uh, business.

371
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:22,820
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Pseudolus said--

372
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:24,823
Pseudolus!
I might have known it.

373
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:27,826
A passage to thessaly for two
At the first tide.

374
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:31,329
In one hour.
Good.  now, care to play for the boat?

375
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:39,286
How dare you!
Arranging an assignation...

376
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,789
Between an innocent boy
And a you-know-what.

377
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,793
There is something
About that you-know-what that you do not know what.

378
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:48,296
What do I know not what?
That girl is my daughter.

379
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,298
Your what?
My daughter.  you've heard me speak of her.

380
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,300
Never.
Well, I don't like to talk about her.

381
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,302
That girl is not
Your daughter. my sister?

382
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:57,805
I go tell his parents.
Wait!  the boy insisted on meeting her.

383
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:02,310
But she's been sold to a captain
Who comes to claim her today. what can happen in an hour?

384
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,313
At his age,
The mind boggles. I go tell his parents.

385
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:08,316
I go with you.
You don't want to be there when I tell them about you.

386
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:10,818
No, I want you to be there
When I tell them about you.

387
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,822
Tell them what about me?
I have nothing to fear. I am a pillar of virtue.

388
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:17,325
It might be of interest
That their pillar of virtue, their slave in chief,

389
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,827
Has secreted in the confines
Of his cubicle...

390
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:23,832
Rome's most extensive collection
Of erotic pottery.

391
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:27,335
Oh!
When did you acquire that large fruit bowl with that frieze--

392
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,840
Pseudolus.
Neither of us is perfect.

393
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:36,344
Well, if it is only
For an hour or so-- where's the harm?

394
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:40,348
Especially with
The master and mistress safely out of the way.

395
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,744
I'm worried about hero!
Perhaps I should go back and keep a fatherly eye!

396
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:55,747
Senex!

397
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:02,753
Stop.
Whoa!

398
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:05,756
<i>- I saw that.
- I was stung by a bee.</i>

399
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:09,260
Oh, my nose.  here?
We shall have to have it resharpened.

400
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:14,765
I suppose I could hasten back
To the stonecutter and join you tomorrow morn--

401
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:18,269
Oh, no,
The trip would tire me. I should be exhausted.

402
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:20,271
You shall go back,
You selfish toad.

403
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:23,274
Now!
Oh, but, my love,

404
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:25,776
I don't know how I shall survive
The long, lonely night...

405
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:28,279
<i>without you.
you'll just have to force yourself.</i>

406
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,290
Master, I've just been
To the harbor. we must hurry.

407
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,792
Are you going somewhere?
No, but you are, both of you.

408
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,795
Oh, I cannot go.

409
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:47,298
Why can you not?

410
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:51,803
As long as the captain has
A contract I must go with him. I must honor my contract.

411
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:57,308
An honest virgin--
What a terrible combination. excuse me.

412
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:59,810
We'll give her
A little knock on the head.

413
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,312
No, I will not use force
Against her.

414
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:05,316
Oh, venus, why did you
Bring us together, only to part us?

415
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:07,818
Be brave, hero.

416
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:10,822
For us, there will
Never be happiness.

417
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,824
We must learn to be happy
Without it.

418
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:15,827
When will the captain take me?

419
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:19,330
In due time,
You will be taken, but not in the garden.

420
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,332
Inside.
But how shall I know when he arrives?

421
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:24,835
He'll knock on the door
Three times.  now just go upstairs and wait.

422
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:26,838
My mistress's bedroom--
The green one.

423
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:29,340
Go, go.
Up, up, up, go, go, go.

424
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,843
Master?
Master, she will go with you, I promise.

425
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:39,350
Go!

426
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,352
Oh, she's gone?
Good.

427
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:44,855
Then master hero, I'll go
To the market and get you a nice, plump, peahen.

428
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:47,859
We must try to get
Your appetite back to food.

429
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,362
Our passport to freedom.
What is it?

430
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:54,365
With consummate skill,
I lifted Hysterium's book of potions.

431
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,867
We'll mix a sleeping potion
In a beaker of wine.  we'll give it to the girl to drink.

432
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:59,370
She'll fall unconscious.
We'll tell Lycus she died of the plague.

433
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:02,373
Then you hie her to the boat.
I hie me to the hills.  free! brilliant!

434
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:05,876
No, no, not brilliant.
Just--  well, yes, brilliant.

435
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:10,381
I just remembered
Something frightening. what?

436
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:12,883
I cannot read.
Find the sleeping potions quickly.

437
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:15,386
What do we need?
The ingredients-- quickly, quickly.

438
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:16,887
"the eye of an eel."
That we have.

439
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:19,390
"the heart of a snail."
That we have.

440
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:23,894
"a cup of mare's sweat."
That we have not. mare's sweat.

441
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,397
Where are we going
To find mare's sweat on a day like this?

442
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:29,400
Quick!  you to the north.
I to the south.

443
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,902
This is exciting.
Isn't it?  go!

444
00:29:38,993 --> 00:29:41,996
Follow me!

445
00:29:41,996 --> 00:29:43,998
Ah!  ah!

446
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:47,001
That way!

447
00:29:48,503 --> 00:29:50,505
Ah.

448
00:30:02,016 --> 00:30:04,018
The green bedroom.
Knock three times.

449
00:30:08,022 --> 00:30:12,526
The captain.
Take me, take me.

450
00:30:13,528 --> 00:30:16,030
I beg your pardon.
Take me.

451
00:30:18,032 --> 00:30:20,034
Just a moment.

452
00:30:23,538 --> 00:30:26,541
Now, what did you say?

453
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:29,043
Take me.
My body is yours.

454
00:30:29,043 --> 00:30:33,047
Is this not what you want?
It does cross my mind from time to time.

455
00:30:33,047 --> 00:30:35,549
But you must know something.
Yes?

456
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:39,053
Though you may have my body,
You shall never have my heart.

457
00:30:39,053 --> 00:30:41,555
Well, you can't
Have everything.

458
00:30:41,556 --> 00:30:46,060
A thousand thanks--
Whichever one of you did this.

459
00:30:49,063 --> 00:30:53,567
Would you believe it?
There was a mare sweating not two streets from here.

460
00:30:53,568 --> 00:30:55,570
Gets to look more
Like his father every day.

461
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:59,073
Pseudolus!
He's here. oh, no.

462
00:30:59,073 --> 00:31:01,075
Remember
Where we stopped. sir, you're back!

463
00:31:01,075 --> 00:31:04,078
She almost broke it.
Who is she?

464
00:31:04,078 --> 00:31:07,581
Sir, you may well ask.
"who is she?"  you ask, as well you may.

465
00:31:07,582 --> 00:31:09,584
Delightful creature.
I shall await your bidding.

466
00:31:09,584 --> 00:31:12,086
My bid--  yes.
Ever your servant.

467
00:31:12,086 --> 00:31:14,088
Ever my servant.
That's it.  your servant.

468
00:31:14,088 --> 00:31:16,090
Your new maid.
We needed someone to help.

469
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:18,092
A new maid.
She seems very loyal.

470
00:31:18,593 --> 00:31:20,595
And very courteous
And very efficient and very thoughtful.

471
00:31:20,595 --> 00:31:25,099
Well, maids like me.
I'm neat.  I like maids. they're neat.

472
00:31:27,602 --> 00:31:30,605
Everybody ought to have
A maid

473
00:31:30,605 --> 00:31:33,107
Everybody ought to have
A working girl

474
00:31:33,107 --> 00:31:36,110
Everybody ought to have
A lurking girl

475
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:39,113
To putter
Around the house

476
00:31:39,113 --> 00:31:42,116
Everybody ought to have
A maid

477
00:31:42,116 --> 00:31:44,618
Everybody ought to have
A menial

478
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:48,122
Consistently congenial

479
00:31:48,122 --> 00:31:51,125
And quieter than a mouse

480
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:54,128
Oh, oh
Wouldn't she be delicious

481
00:31:54,128 --> 00:31:58,132
Tidying up the dishes
Neat as a pin, oh, oh

482
00:31:58,132 --> 00:32:02,636
[ together ]
Wouldn't she be delightful sweeping out, sleeping in

483
00:32:02,637 --> 00:32:05,640
Everybody ought to have
A maid

484
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,142
Someone who when fetching you
Your slipper will

485
00:32:08,142 --> 00:32:11,145
Be winsome
As a whippoorwill

486
00:32:11,145 --> 00:32:14,148
And graceful
As a grouse

487
00:32:14,148 --> 00:32:17,151
Fluttering up the stairways
Shuttering up the windows

488
00:32:17,151 --> 00:32:20,154
Cluttering up the bedroom
Buttering up the master

489
00:32:20,154 --> 00:32:23,657
Puttering all around
The house

490
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:27,661
- a maid?
- a maid.

491
00:32:27,662 --> 00:32:29,163
A maid.
[ together ] a maid.

492
00:32:29,163 --> 00:32:31,165
Everybody ought to have
A maid

493
00:32:31,165 --> 00:32:34,168
Everybody ought to have
A serving girl

494
00:32:34,168 --> 00:32:38,672
A loyal and unswerving girl
Who's quieter than a mouse

495
00:32:41,175 --> 00:32:43,677
Oh, oh
Think of her at the dustbin

496
00:32:43,678 --> 00:32:46,681
Especially when she's
Just been traipsing about

497
00:32:46,681 --> 00:32:49,684
Oh, oh
Wouldn't she be delightful

498
00:32:49,684 --> 00:32:52,687
Living in
Giving out

499
00:32:52,687 --> 00:32:55,189
Everybody ought to have
A maid

500
00:32:55,189 --> 00:32:58,192
Someone who you hire
When you're short of help

501
00:32:58,192 --> 00:33:00,694
To offer you
The sort of help

502
00:33:01,195 --> 00:33:04,198
You never get from a spouse

503
00:33:04,198 --> 00:33:07,201
Pattering through the attic
Chattering in the cellar

504
00:33:07,201 --> 00:33:10,204
Clattering in the kitchen
Flattering in the bedroom

505
00:33:10,204 --> 00:33:14,208
Puttering all around
The house

506
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:16,710
The virgin--
How is she? shh.  a maid.

507
00:33:16,711 --> 00:33:19,213
A maid.
A maid. a maid?

508
00:33:19,213 --> 00:33:22,216
[ together ]
Everybody ought to have a maid

509
00:33:22,216 --> 00:33:24,718
Someone who's efficient
And reliable

510
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:29,223
Obedient and pliable
And quieter than a mouse

511
00:33:31,726 --> 00:33:34,228
Oh, oh
Wouldn't she be so nimble

512
00:33:34,228 --> 00:33:37,231
Fiddling with her thimble
Mending a gown

513
00:33:37,231 --> 00:33:40,234
Oh, oh
Wouldn't she be delightful

514
00:33:40,234 --> 00:33:43,237
Cleaning up
Leaning down

515
00:33:43,237 --> 00:33:45,739
Everybody ought to have
A maid

516
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,743
Someone who'll be busy
As a bumblebee

517
00:33:48,743 --> 00:33:51,746
And even if you grumble
Be

518
00:33:51,746 --> 00:33:54,248
As graceful as a grouse

519
00:33:54,248 --> 00:33:57,751
Wriggling
In the anteroom jiggling in the living room

520
00:33:57,752 --> 00:34:00,755
Giggling
In the dining room wiggling in the other rooms

521
00:34:00,755 --> 00:34:04,759
Fluttering all around
The house

522
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:06,761
Tell me, the virgin--
How is she?  I want-- the house

523
00:34:06,761 --> 00:34:08,763
Tell me, the virgin--
I want to know how's she--

524
00:34:08,763 --> 00:34:11,766
The house
How is the virgin?

525
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:14,268
The house

526
00:34:14,268 --> 00:34:19,273
She's very low.
You remember the smile? it's now nearly a grin.

527
00:34:19,273 --> 00:34:22,776
I pray she lasts.  I had
A dreadful experience with a young officer...

528
00:34:22,777 --> 00:34:24,779
To whom
I had sold a virgin. what happened?

529
00:34:24,779 --> 00:34:26,781
She turned out to be a dud.

530
00:34:26,781 --> 00:34:29,283
A dud virgin?
How could that happen?

531
00:34:29,283 --> 00:34:33,287
You see, the fellow
Who sold me the dud virgin also sold me a dud eunuch.

532
00:34:33,788 --> 00:34:38,793
I'll keep this one alive
As long as I can. you're a saint.

533
00:34:38,793 --> 00:34:42,797
Now, I shall personally instruct
The new maid in the niceties of housework, starting in my room.

534
00:34:42,797 --> 00:34:45,299
Uh, b-b-but, sir,
Uh, your son...

535
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,302
May be
In that very house. oh.  oh, dear.

536
00:34:48,803 --> 00:34:50,805
Sir, this house is empty.
Yes?

537
00:34:50,805 --> 00:34:54,809
Oh, so it is, sir.
Don't you remember before your friend and neighbor,

538
00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:57,812
Erronius went abroad
In search of his children, stolen in infancy by pirates,

539
00:34:57,812 --> 00:35:00,314
He asked you to look into
His house from time to time?

540
00:35:00,314 --> 00:35:03,817
Oh, yes, now might be
As good a time as any. send the girl in here.

541
00:35:03,818 --> 00:35:08,823
But sir, only my deepest
Devotion to you allows me to speak so frankly.

542
00:35:08,823 --> 00:35:13,828
You have trudged the road
Quite some way, and I fear that this great physical exertion--

543
00:35:13,828 --> 00:35:18,833
- [ sniffing ]
- whew.  great heavens.

544
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:22,837
Is that me?  I smell like
An overheated horse.

545
00:35:22,837 --> 00:35:25,339
I must bathe.
At least.

546
00:35:25,339 --> 00:35:28,842
Shall I send the girl to you,
Say, in one hour?

547
00:35:28,843 --> 00:35:30,845
[ sniffing ]
At least.

548
00:35:40,188 --> 00:35:41,689
[ Erronius' voice ]
Home at last.

549
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:45,193
After years of searching
For my long-lost children,

550
00:35:45,193 --> 00:35:48,696
How good it is to see
This street once more.

551
00:35:48,696 --> 00:35:51,699
These tired old eyes
Fill with tears...

552
00:35:51,699 --> 00:35:54,702
At the sight
Of the little they see.

553
00:35:59,207 --> 00:36:01,209
Pardon me, young woman.

554
00:36:01,209 --> 00:36:05,213
I'm sorry, but i--
Oh, what a lovely baby.

555
00:36:05,713 --> 00:36:11,218
Just about the age
Of my children when they were stolen in infancy by pirates.

556
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:15,223
But at least I have
The comforts of my lonely home.

557
00:36:15,223 --> 00:36:16,724
Sir!

558
00:36:16,724 --> 00:36:21,729
Who are you?
Hysterium, sir, servant to Senex.

559
00:36:26,234 --> 00:36:28,736
What was that?
I didn't hear anything.

560
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:34,742
I didn't hear that either.
It was an eerie sound.

561
00:36:34,742 --> 00:36:38,245
Eerie sound?
Like the house was haunted.

562
00:36:38,246 --> 00:36:41,249
Sir, what I'm about
To tell you is eerie.

563
00:36:41,249 --> 00:36:43,751
Your house is haunted.
Haunted?

564
00:36:43,751 --> 00:36:45,753
Haunted as
The day is long.

565
00:36:45,753 --> 00:36:49,757
Perhaps you should stay
With relatives, distant relatives.

566
00:36:49,757 --> 00:36:52,760
Yes.  no.
Fetch me a soothsayer.

567
00:36:53,261 --> 00:36:55,763
A soothsayer?
He must search my house at once.

568
00:37:00,768 --> 00:37:05,272
Sir, you're in need
Of a soothsayer. how did you know?

569
00:37:05,273 --> 00:37:08,276
I'd be a fine soothsayer
If I didn't.

570
00:37:08,776 --> 00:37:10,778
Well, there's a spirit
In my house.

571
00:37:10,778 --> 00:37:14,281
Silence!
[ screams ]

572
00:37:14,282 --> 00:37:16,784
I'm about to say
The sooth.

573
00:37:16,784 --> 00:37:19,787
You--  i-i-i see it.
I see everything.

574
00:37:19,787 --> 00:37:24,792
You-you have been--
You have been abroad...

575
00:37:24,792 --> 00:37:26,794
<i>for... twenty years.</i>

576
00:37:26,794 --> 00:37:31,799
You have been searching
For...

577
00:37:31,799 --> 00:37:33,801
A child.

578
00:37:33,801 --> 00:37:36,303
No, no, no, two childs.

579
00:37:37,305 --> 00:37:39,307
A fine big boy...

580
00:37:41,309 --> 00:37:44,312
And a strange
Little boy.

581
00:37:44,312 --> 00:37:49,817
No, no, no!
[ vocalizing ] a girl, a girl!

582
00:37:49,817 --> 00:37:52,319
A girl!
A boy and a girl!

583
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,823
Can you find them for me?
Certainly, I can find them.

584
00:37:55,823 --> 00:38:00,327
Each wear a ring
That has engraved upon it a gaggle of geese.

585
00:38:00,328 --> 00:38:05,333
There are only two more
Like this in the world, and my children wear them.

586
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:08,836
How many geese
In a gaggle? at least seven.

587
00:38:08,836 --> 00:38:11,839
Seven!  before I say
The sooth again,

588
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:16,343
You must run seven times
Around the seven hills of rome.

589
00:38:16,344 --> 00:38:21,349
- and the spirit?
- it will be gone by the time you'll have done my bidding.

590
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:23,351
Thanks.
To the hills!

591
00:38:23,351 --> 00:38:26,854
To the hills.
No, this is the way, sir.

592
00:38:26,854 --> 00:38:29,857
Thank you, young woman.

593
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:35,362
Sir, sir!
You forgot your gaggle!

594
00:38:35,363 --> 00:38:38,366
You see, everything
Is turning out fine.

595
00:38:38,866 --> 00:38:41,869
Everything's turning out fine
With the master thinking the virgin's a maid,

596
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:43,871
The virgin's thinking
She's the master's mistress, and the mistress not knowing...

597
00:38:43,871 --> 00:38:45,372
Her son's about
With his tongue hanging out.

598
00:38:45,373 --> 00:38:49,377
Just see to it that the master
Stays in the bath the next hour,

599
00:38:49,377 --> 00:38:51,379
And I'll soon get the girl
Out of there. how soon?

600
00:38:51,379 --> 00:38:54,382
As soon as master hero
Brings more mare's sweat.

601
00:38:54,382 --> 00:38:56,884
Mare's sweat!
[ Senex ] there's no need to remind me.

602
00:38:57,385 --> 00:39:00,388
I need some more bath towels
At once.

603
00:39:04,392 --> 00:39:07,395
Be patient, my dear.
I shall not keep you panting long.

604
00:39:09,397 --> 00:39:11,899
[ man ]
Oils!  oils for lamps!

605
00:39:16,404 --> 00:39:19,407
Come on,
You rotten slave, move.

606
00:39:19,407 --> 00:39:22,410
Pick those chains up.
Come on.

607
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:25,913
Ah, thank you, lad.
It is thirsty work.

608
00:39:25,913 --> 00:39:27,915
That's my sweat.

609
00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:30,918
Ah!

610
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:56,944
Yes?
Is this the house of Marcus Lycus?

611
00:39:56,944 --> 00:39:59,947
Yes.
Then aside, eunuch.

612
00:40:04,452 --> 00:40:07,955
Inform Lycus
We would see him at once.

613
00:40:08,456 --> 00:40:11,459
Yes, possibilities.
Carry on.  was that a customer, dear eunuch?

614
00:40:11,459 --> 00:40:13,461
Oh, welcome,
Most noble warrior.

615
00:40:13,961 --> 00:40:15,963
Won't you come in?
Perhaps some wine and honey?

616
00:40:15,963 --> 00:40:19,466
Or perhaps another type
Of morsel is your interest? no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

617
00:40:19,467 --> 00:40:22,970
We are emissaries
From he on whose behalf a maiden was purchased from you.

618
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:26,473
Oh, yes, a maiden.  splendid.
She'll be claimed within the hour.

619
00:40:26,474 --> 00:40:28,976
By our most illustrious
Captain, Miles Gloriosus.

620
00:40:29,477 --> 00:40:32,980
<i>I know that name,
And I don't think I like it. the mighty Miles...</i>

621
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:38,485
Bids you know that he did
Purchase a maiden from scum such as yourself some years ago.

622
00:40:38,486 --> 00:40:41,989
This so-called maiden within a
Few months delivered ample proof she'd been nothing of the sort.

623
00:40:41,989 --> 00:40:43,991
Accidents will happen.

624
00:40:43,991 --> 00:40:46,994
Ah, but never again
To the great Gloriosus. oh.

625
00:40:46,994 --> 00:40:48,996
Should anything be amiss
With your maiden,

626
00:40:48,996 --> 00:40:50,998
He'll seize your entire stock
And throw them to the troops.

627
00:40:50,998 --> 00:40:54,001
- that's fair.
- then he'll burn down your house.

628
00:40:54,001 --> 00:40:56,503
- reasonable.
- and then he'll--

629
00:40:56,504 --> 00:40:59,507
No, no, just inform the captain
The maiden will be ready...

630
00:40:59,507 --> 00:41:01,509
And very willing
And very healthy.

631
00:41:01,509 --> 00:41:04,011
Ah.

632
00:41:04,011 --> 00:41:06,013
With just a slight touch
Of plague.

633
00:41:06,013 --> 00:41:10,517
Excuse me, noble sir,
Have you seen a handsome youth running after a sweating horse?

634
00:41:11,018 --> 00:41:14,021
He was carrying--
Very generous of you, sir.

635
00:41:14,021 --> 00:41:19,026
Excuse me, madam.
A cool youth and a hot mare, have you by any chance--

636
00:41:19,026 --> 00:41:21,528
Most kind of you, madam.

637
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:26,534
Sir, might I ask--
Thank you humbly, sir.

638
00:41:37,545 --> 00:41:39,547
Master hero
Has been here.

639
00:41:44,051 --> 00:41:46,553
Thank you kindly, sir.

640
00:41:48,055 --> 00:41:50,057
I'm sorry, I can't stop now.

641
00:41:50,057 --> 00:41:55,062
You've been sold?
To whom? a syrian shepherd?

642
00:41:55,062 --> 00:41:57,564
He's collecting you
Within the hour.

643
00:41:58,065 --> 00:42:00,067
That means I'll never
See her again.  listen.

644
00:42:00,067 --> 00:42:05,072
In a few-- in a few--
Listen carefully! [ shouting ]

645
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,081
Oh.

646
00:42:17,751 --> 00:42:20,754
In one hour,
The captain arrives. how can I save my head?

647
00:42:22,256 --> 00:42:26,260
One hour before
The syrian shepherd arrives. how can I save Gymnasia?

648
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,763
If I could just find someone
To take my place for an hour. but who?

649
00:42:29,763 --> 00:42:33,767
If I could but take
Lycus' place for one hour. but how?

650
00:42:35,769 --> 00:42:38,271
[ both ]
Excuse me.  quite all right. not at all.

651
00:42:38,272 --> 00:42:40,274
Pseudolus.
Lycus.

652
00:42:40,274 --> 00:42:42,776
Hail, Marcus Lycus.
I was just looking for you.

653
00:42:42,776 --> 00:42:44,778
You were looking for me?
But I was looking for you.

654
00:42:44,778 --> 00:42:46,780
Isn't that amazing?
Fantastic.

655
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:49,282
[ both ]
It's about the girls.

656
00:42:49,283 --> 00:42:51,285
Excuse me.  did you say
It's about the girls? yes.  did you?

657
00:42:51,285 --> 00:42:53,287
Yes.
Fantastic. amazing.

658
00:42:53,787 --> 00:42:56,790
You see, dear Pseudolus,
It occurred to me this morning when you were in my place--

659
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:59,292
That I didn't have
Enough time-- to definitely decide.

660
00:42:59,293 --> 00:43:01,795
About choosing a wife.
Precisely.

661
00:43:01,795 --> 00:43:04,297
Aha, what a marvelous
Rapport we're having.

662
00:43:04,298 --> 00:43:08,302
Amazing.
Fantastic.  and I was thinking, dear Pseudolus.

663
00:43:08,302 --> 00:43:10,804
That I'd spend
A little more time-- alone and undisturbed--

664
00:43:10,804 --> 00:43:12,305
[ both ]
With the girls.

665
00:43:12,306 --> 00:43:16,810
Lycus,
You're making me cry.

666
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:18,812
One other thing.
You see, my father--

667
00:43:18,812 --> 00:43:20,814
You have a father?
Yes.

668
00:43:20,814 --> 00:43:23,316
Isn't that amazing?
Fantastic.

669
00:43:23,317 --> 00:43:26,320
And furthermore,
He is on his way to my house right now,

670
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,822
And, well-well, he thinks
I'm just a tradesman.

671
00:43:28,822 --> 00:43:32,826
Poor old fellow.  but what if,
When he arrives, we have moved the girls elsewhere?

672
00:43:33,327 --> 00:43:35,829
Yes, but how to find
A suitable elsewhere?

673
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:39,833
Where else?
The house of the good Senex.

674
00:43:39,833 --> 00:43:42,335
Why not?  he's out of the way
For an hour.

675
00:43:42,336 --> 00:43:46,840
Yes, but who will take care of
My place?  the syrian shepherd comes to buy the silent woman.

676
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:51,845
And I don't suppose, Pseudolus,
I could impose upon you-- to take your place?

677
00:43:51,845 --> 00:43:54,347
Pretend that I'm you
For an hour?

678
00:43:54,348 --> 00:43:56,850
Lycus, it would be
A privilege.

679
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:59,352
Oh, now you're making me cry.
Oh.

680
00:43:59,353 --> 00:44:03,357
Oh, one more thing.
The roman captain who comes to claim the plaguey virgin,

681
00:44:03,357 --> 00:44:05,359
Should he arrive
While I'm gone-- and mind you,

682
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,861
I do not,
For one moment-- I'll just hand her over.

683
00:44:07,861 --> 00:44:10,864
Yes, but if she's
Not alive, fob him off with another girl.

684
00:44:10,864 --> 00:44:13,867
I'm told he's a most kind,
Gentle and considerate man.

685
00:44:13,867 --> 00:44:16,369
Have no fear.
I won't, dear Pseudolus.

686
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:19,873
And may I say
You will never live to regret this.

687
00:44:24,878 --> 00:44:27,380
Gone to see
A nose grinder indeed.

688
00:44:27,381 --> 00:44:31,885
He's cavorting
With those courtesans. but, mother, what can I do?

689
00:44:32,386 --> 00:44:34,888
Do?  return
To rome immediately...

690
00:44:34,888 --> 00:44:38,391
Before he can do
What no doubt he's already done.

691
00:44:38,392 --> 00:44:39,893
Go!
Oh!

692
00:44:40,894 --> 00:44:42,896
Ah!

693
00:44:42,896 --> 00:44:45,398
No, no, right.
No.

694
00:44:48,402 --> 00:44:51,405
Come on, now.
Hey, hey! [ neighs ]

695
00:44:51,405 --> 00:44:53,407
Hey!

696
00:44:59,413 --> 00:45:01,415
Come on, come on.
[ grunting ]

697
00:45:03,917 --> 00:45:05,418
Good morning.

698
00:45:05,419 --> 00:45:09,423
Quickly, on your feet!
The change will do you good. quick, quick, out!

699
00:45:09,923 --> 00:45:13,426
<i>come, quickly.
quick, quick. you there!  you there!</i>

700
00:45:13,427 --> 00:45:16,930
Go, go!
Oh, there's so much of you there.

701
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:19,432
Later, later.
Go, go!

702
00:45:19,433 --> 00:45:21,935
<i>come on, run.
why do you stand here?</i>

703
00:45:21,935 --> 00:45:25,438
Come on, we have no time.
Come, come, come, come.

704
00:45:25,439 --> 00:45:27,941
You will be out of here
Before that shepherd arrives.

705
00:45:27,941 --> 00:45:29,943
Can you leave
At a moment's notice?

706
00:45:32,446 --> 00:45:34,948
No arguing.  go away.
Quickly, come, come.

707
00:45:34,948 --> 00:45:38,451
Oh, Vibrata, really, go!
Come, come.

708
00:45:38,452 --> 00:45:40,454
First time around.

709
00:45:42,456 --> 00:45:44,958
What was that?

710
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:59,889
Ho there.  I am seeking
The house of Marcus Lycus.

711
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:03,393
Well, who is it that reeks
The louse of Mycus Leecus? hold, sir.

712
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:06,396
Who leaks the louse--
You're not holding, sir.

713
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:10,400
Who is he
That seeks the house of Marcus Lycus?

714
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,404
A foot soldier
Of captain Miles Gloriosus.

715
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:16,906
Smartly done.
Thank you.

716
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:20,410
My captain dispatches me
To inform you that he is but a half a league away...

717
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:22,412
And bids you honor this.

718
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:29,419
You know what this is,
Of course?

719
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,924
Of course I know
What this is. this is writing.

720
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:36,426
This is your contract
With the captain.

721
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:38,928
And a pretty piece of work.
Thank you.

722
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:41,932
What is this word here?

723
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:44,434
That is "Lycus."

724
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:48,438
You realize who you are
Speaking to? yes, sir.

725
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:50,940
And do you realize
What it says there?

726
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:53,944
I know
What it says there.

727
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:57,948
Words, and I intend
To stand behind these words, or my name is not Marcus Lycus.

728
00:46:57,948 --> 00:47:01,451
- Pseudolus!
- or my name is not Pseudolus Marcus Lycus.

729
00:47:01,451 --> 00:47:04,454
One moment.  I must have
A word with my eunuch.

730
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:08,958
- oh, please.
- thank you very much. come here, eunuch!

731
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:15,465
Eunuch?
How dare you call me that?

732
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:18,968
You know it isn't true,
I know it isn't true, so what do we care what they think?

733
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:21,471
Why are you
Calling yourself Lycus?

734
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:23,473
You see--

735
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:25,475
I can't tell you.
Why should I spoil your day?

736
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:27,977
How can you spoil
A total disaster? just listen.

737
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:29,980
The captain comes
To claim the girl now. that's terrible.

738
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,482
Why?
The master also wants her now.

739
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:35,485
He can't have her.
Just keep him in that house and don't let him out.

740
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:37,987
But Pseudolus--
But Pseudolus-- I'm Lycus.  I'm Lycus.

741
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:41,491
But Pseudolus--
I'm Lycus, and I still know where you keep that pottery.

742
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:45,495
But Lycus--
Good-bye, Lycus. farewell, Lycus.

743
00:47:45,495 --> 00:47:48,998
<i>good luck, Lycus.
he's Lycus.</i>

744
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,503
Tell your captain
His bride awaits.

745
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:56,506
Smartly done.

746
00:47:57,507 --> 00:48:00,009
- Hysterium.
- uh, sire.

747
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:03,513
You remember that potion
You prepared which so fills one with energy...

748
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:05,515
One can almost perform
Miracles?

749
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:08,518
Oh, yes, sire,
We still have some left from your wedding night.

750
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:11,020
Bring me a beaker.

751
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:13,023
Yes, master.

752
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:17,027
Good afternoon,
Good afternoon.

753
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:24,534
Good afternoon.

My bride, my bride
I've come to claim my bride

00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:53,062
Come tenderly to crush her
Against my side

00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:57,067
Let haste be made
I cannot be delayed

757
00:48:57,067 --> 00:49:01,571
There are lands to conquer
Cities to loot and people to degrade

758
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:04,574
Look at those arms
Look at that chest look at them

759
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:08,578
Not to mention the rest
Even I am impressed

My bride, my bride
Come, bring to me my bride

761
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:17,086
My lust for her
No longer can be denied

00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:21,591
Convey the news
I have no time to lose

763
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:26,596
There are towns to plunder
Temples to burn and women to abuse

764
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:28,097
Look at that foot
Look at that heel

765
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:30,100
Mark the magnificent
Muscles of steel

766
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:34,104
I am my ideal

Of thousands

I, oppressor
Of the meek [ sighing ]

<i>- [ all sighing ]
- subduer of the weak</i>

In wit the most inspired

In dress the best displayed

Cunning and keen

Look at the size
Of those thighs like a mighty machine

781

Those are the mightiest thighs
I ever have "theen," I mean

I have no time to waste

And booty to divide

Hail, Miles Gloriosus.
You are?

792
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:11,200
Marcus Lycus.
I am dazzled by your presence.

00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:13,703
Everyone is.
Where is my bride?

794
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:16,205
It is a sad tale
I have to tell, courageous captain.

795
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:18,708
Bad news--
[ screaming ] did not my aide inform you...

796
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:22,212
That should anything be amiss
With this maiden, your house would be burned,

797
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:24,714
Your women thrown to my troops
And your life forfeit?

798
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:27,717
He didn't, did he?
He did.

799
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:31,220
He did,
And I meant it. [ grunting ]

<i>there's been some mistake.
here is the man you want. tell him.</i>

801

Tell him who I am.
Well, everybody knows who you are, Lycus.

802
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:41,731
No, no, tell him who I am.
Tell him.

803
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:44,734
Rely on me.
He is Marcus Lycus.

804
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:47,236
Not so!
He is Lycus!

805
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:50,240
Sire, if you but look within,
You will find none but hooded men.

806
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,244
We are a holy order,
An ancient brotherhood of lepers, unclean.

807

<i>- unclean.
- unclean, unclean.</i>

808
00:51:57,747 --> 00:52:01,250
Well, Lycus,
What of this bad news? there is no bad news.

809
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:06,256
I only said that so as not
To make the gods jealous. she is ugly.  ugly!

810
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:09,259
<i>ugly!  ugly!
really, she's beautiful.</i>

811
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:14,264
I did not-- I did not
Want them envying you. what is she like?

812
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:17,767
A face so fair,
A heart so pure, sir.

813
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:21,771
If you had been born a woman,
You would have been she.

814
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:24,273
As magnificent as that?

815
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:26,776
She will be ready soon.
Perhaps if we brought some food.

816
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:29,779
That will not be necessary.
I will await her in your house.

817
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:31,781
No!
No?

818
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:33,783
I-i-i meant yes.
It just came out no.

819
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:36,786
And who are you?
My chief eunuch, sir.

820
00:52:36,786 --> 00:52:39,789
[ stomps foot ]
Just kick him if he offends you.

821
00:52:39,789 --> 00:52:43,793
Surround the house!
While I am within, let no one else enter.

822
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:47,797
What was that all about?
Why didn't you give him the girl?

823
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:49,799
Isn't it time we two
Started trusting each other?

824
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:52,301
One of us isn't ready yet.
Why didn't you give him the girl?

825
00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:57,306
She refuses to go with him.
But master hero's out getting her a potion.

826
00:52:58,308 --> 00:53:00,310
So you just keep the master
In his bath until--

827
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:04,314
Arrange food,
Drink, entertainment and a sit-down orgy for 14.

828
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:08,818
These sands will run out
In exactly one half hour.

829
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:13,823
If my bride is not delivered
By then, this house will be an empty patch of ground.

830
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:15,324
That rotten Lycus.

831
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:19,329
That lovely Pseudolus.
Mmm!

832
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:21,831
What a glorious day, my friend.
Won't you join me in a beaker?

833
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:26,836
Everyone, a beaker with me!
Crassus.

834
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:30,840
Lycus?
Rascal.  I heard you were abroad in search of pulchritude.

835
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,843
Well, I returned this morn
With as choice a cargo as you've ever seen.

836
00:53:33,843 --> 00:53:36,345
Good man.
From crete.

837

Do not breathe on me. the plague, the plague!

- there's no plague on crete.
- no plague?

No one lying around
Smiling themselves to death?

- it's the healthiest isle
In the world. - he lied to me.  he tricked me.

841
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:52,361
- you, tricked?
- yes, but not for long.

842
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:55,865
I go to the captain,
Save my house and see that that swine is killed.

843
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:59,869
Which swine?
The lyingest, cheatingest, sloppiest slave in all rome.

That here waited for me that black-fringed temptress...

Ooh!  get off!
Get off!  get off!

All gaul was divided into eight parts.

I am no leper.  I am Lycus!

Ah, the poor creature.

858
00:55:11,309 --> 00:55:14,312
Just jab him back
Into his den of ill health.

859
00:55:14,312 --> 00:55:17,815
What?  oh, Pseudolus,
I'll have my revenge.

860
00:55:18,316 --> 00:55:20,318
I'll get in to see
The captain yet. I will tell--

Yes, that's a good one.

"hold that--
Hold that, tiber."

Resembling mare's sweat,

But when I heard the revellers,
I thought my captain had come.

00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:04,362
He has,
But he's not ready yet. just wait in there.  wait!

That's what virgins are supposed to do best.

Wait, my little one. I must wash my hands.

I shall be back in a nonce,
At most, two nonces.

Just one more scrub?

885

No, that's enough.

You must drink it while it's hot.

Whoa!

Don't lean on those things. get to work.

Madam!
Where is my husband?

899
00:58:13,608 --> 00:58:16,611
On the best of intuition,
I believe that he is fowling the nest,

900
00:58:16,611 --> 00:58:19,113
And it seems he has brought in
The legions to help.

901
00:58:19,113 --> 00:58:21,615
Who are all these people?
Madam, at this very moment,

902
00:58:21,616 --> 00:58:23,618
The hospitality of your house
Is being enjoyed...

903
00:58:23,618 --> 00:58:25,620
By a great captain,
Miles Gloriosus.

<i>The Gloriosus?

He requested
A few moments rest in your charming residence.

906
00:58:31,125 --> 00:58:34,128
As the daughter
Of a roman general, I hoped you would not object.

907

Object?  Pseudolus,
You have acted well.

908
00:58:37,131 --> 00:58:39,633
I must greet this captain
At once.

Captain Gloriosus,

910
00:58:41,636 --> 00:58:43,638
I am shattered
That I was not here to greet you personally.

00:58:44,138 --> 00:58:47,641
- you are of this house?
- for many, many years.

912
00:58:47,642 --> 00:58:51,145
My father,
You know, captain, was general Magnus.

913
00:58:51,145 --> 00:58:54,648
On the last anniversary
Of his death, I entertained over 200 officers.

Two hundred?
By yourself?

And changed this dusty robe,

I last saw him, he was.

I want to know
If my husband is in the house.

928
00:59:38,192 --> 00:59:42,696
No, but he should be here soon.
Madam, might I suggest you take your bath now?

929

With a fresh robe.

When he arrives,
Keep him busy downstairs.

[ yelling ]
Captain, please!  i--

985
01:03:33,728 --> 01:03:36,230
Captain, the virgin is--
Captain, a word--

986
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:39,233
Louder music!
The captain wants louder music!

987
01:03:39,233 --> 01:03:41,235
I'm not happy in my work,
Captain.

988
01:03:41,736 --> 01:03:43,237
Did you ever see
A jester like this?

989
01:03:43,738 --> 01:03:47,241
The remarks he makes!
He's the best I've ever seen.

990
01:03:47,241 --> 01:03:50,244
His exit!
Do the flying exit.

991
01:03:50,244 --> 01:03:53,247
What?
[ stammers ] no.

992
01:03:53,748 --> 01:03:56,250
<i>- [ screaming ]
- [ Miles, Pseudolus laughing ]</i>

993
01:03:57,752 --> 01:04:01,255
Didn't I tell you
You'd enjoy this? I did.

994
01:04:01,255 --> 01:04:04,758
You are a good fellow.
It's really going to pain me to have to kill you.

995
01:04:04,759 --> 01:04:08,763
Kill me?
Indeed, Lycus, if she is not at my feet within two minutes.

996
01:04:08,763 --> 01:04:10,765
Could you make it five?
Two.

997
01:04:11,265 --> 01:04:13,767
Two.  two minutes.

998
01:04:13,851 --> 01:04:18,856
Philia!  Philia, you go
To the captain now, like it or not.

999
01:04:18,856 --> 01:04:20,858
But I've been ready
And waiting.

1000
01:04:20,858 --> 01:04:23,360
But Pseudolus said
You refused to. oh, come.

1001
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,363
<i>[ Miles ]
bring me that girl, or you'll all perish!</i>

1002
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:28,365
You see,
That's not a happy captain.

1003
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:30,367
That voice!
I know that voice.

1004
01:04:30,868 --> 01:04:32,369
[ Hysterium ]
Of course you do. that's your captain.

1005
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:36,373
<i>Oh, that's not my captain.
That's the brute who raped my country, Thrace.</i>

1006
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:39,876
He raped Thrace?
And then he came and did it again and then again.

1007
01:04:39,877 --> 01:04:41,879
He raped Thrace thrice?

1008
01:04:41,879 --> 01:04:44,381
Oh, I'm not going
With him.

1009
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:47,384
Will you now go
With hero? oh, yes!  yes!

1010
01:04:47,885 --> 01:04:51,388
Go back to hero's room
And wait there. [ sighs ]

1011
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:54,391
He'll burn our house.
Fear not. I have a simple plan.

1012
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:57,894
I don't want to hear it.
All we have to do is tell the captain the virgin has died.

1013
01:04:57,895 --> 01:04:59,897
I think I heard that.
He'll never believe it.

1014
01:04:59,897 --> 01:05:01,899
We'll need a body.
Anybody's body.

1015
01:05:01,899 --> 01:05:03,901
Can you get one from gusto,
The body snatcher?

1016
01:05:03,901 --> 01:05:06,904
He owes me a favor,
But he died yesterday.

1017
01:05:06,904 --> 01:05:09,406
Oh, uh,
What about his body? somebody snatched it.

1018
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:12,409
Let's see.
Who do we know that's dead?

1019
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:14,411
I wish I was.

1020
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:28,425
I'm a disgrace to my family.
My father will turn in his grave.

1021
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:31,428
- your father is alive.
- this will kill him.

1022
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:36,433
<i>oh, come here.
just lie down.  it'll be all over in one moment.</i>

1023
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:42,939
You're delicious.

1024
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:45,442
What if he tries
To kiss me? he won't kiss you!

1025
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:48,445
How can he help it
If I'm so delicious? oh, come back here.

1026
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:51,948
Just lie still.
Just lie still.

1027
01:05:51,949 --> 01:05:55,953
The captain will take
One look at you, shudder and go on his way, heartbroken.

1028
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:59,956
It'll never work.
Look at me. just look at me.

1029
01:05:59,957 --> 01:06:04,461
I can't take my eyes off you.

1030
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:06,463
You're lovely

1031
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:09,966
Absolutely lovely

1032
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:14,971
Who'd believe
The loveliness

1033
01:06:14,972 --> 01:06:16,974
Of you

1034
01:06:16,974 --> 01:06:18,976
No!
Come back here and lie down!

1035
01:06:18,976 --> 01:06:21,979
Oh.
Perfect

1036
01:06:21,979 --> 01:06:24,982
Sweet and warm and winsome

1037
01:06:25,983 --> 01:06:28,485
Radiant as in some

1038
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:33,490
Dream come true

1039
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:38,995
Now venus will seem tame

1040
01:06:39,997 --> 01:06:43,000
Helen
And her thousand ships

1041
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:46,503
Will have to die of shame

1042
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:50,507
You're so lovely

1043
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:53,510
Frighteningly lovely

1044
01:06:55,012 --> 01:07:03,020
That the world
Will never seem the same

1045
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:06,023
I'm lovely

Who'd believe
The loveliness

Some jewelry? jewelry?

[ mutters ]
Erronius' gaggle.

1056
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:41,558
Ah!

1057
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:46,563
I'm so lovely

1058
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:50,066

Literally lovely

Never seem

The same

1063
01:08:12,089 --> 01:08:15,592
Now I go get the pallbearers.
Wait here.

1064
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:17,594
I'll never get away with it.

1065
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:22,098
You will.  it's easy.
Just lie still and think dead thoughts.

1066
01:08:50,878 --> 01:08:54,882
The time is up!
Ransack the house!

1067

Oh, woe.  oh, woe.

1068

Oh, woe.

And oh, woe again!

Oh.
Ah!

1071
01:09:06,393 --> 01:09:09,396
For the last time,
Where is my bride?

1072
01:09:09,396 --> 01:09:11,898
For the very last time,
Here is your bride--

1073
01:09:11,899 --> 01:09:15,903
Here on this appalling pall,
Dead.

1074
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:20,908
Dead?
Permanently dead. dead, dead.

1075

Oh, monstrous fate!

My sweet, innocent bride--
Dead.

1077
01:09:25,913 --> 01:09:28,415
Yes.  give her air!

1078
01:09:28,415 --> 01:09:30,917
How-how did she die?
Well, she just sort of rolled over, and--

1079
01:09:30,918 --> 01:09:32,920
No, no.
How did it happen?

1080
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:36,423
One glimpse
Of your grandeur from above. the shock was too much.

1081
01:09:36,924 --> 01:09:39,927
Poor child.
A virgin till the end.

1082
01:09:39,927 --> 01:09:42,930
- a lot of good it did you.
- spare me.

- I cannot control my tears.
- go ahead. it's nature's release.

1084
01:09:46,433 --> 01:09:51,438
All her bridal bower
Becomes a burial bier of bitter bereavement.

1085
01:09:51,438 --> 01:09:54,941
Very good.  can you say,
"titus the tailor told ten tall tales...

1086
01:09:54,942 --> 01:09:56,944
To titania the titmouse"?

1087
01:09:56,944 --> 01:10:00,447
Do not try to cheer me.
I am inconsolable.

1088
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:03,450
Why torture yourself?
Just go. yes.

1089
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:05,952
Yes.  poor girl.
To have died so young...

1090
01:10:05,953 --> 01:10:08,455
Without ever having
Experienced me.

1091

<i>You're right.
Bye-bye. no!</i>

1092

I cannot leave without
Giving her the comfort of a proper funeral service.

1093
01:10:14,962 --> 01:10:18,966
Do you have time for that?
Isn't there a war you should be starting-- silence!

- silence!
- I insist on conducting a funeral.  summon mourners.

Mourners.  mourners.
Back.

1096

Back, back, back!
What does he mean a "funeral"?

1097
01:10:28,976 --> 01:10:31,478
A funeral.
A rapid requiem, a quick dirge, nothing.

1098
01:10:31,478 --> 01:10:33,980
All right.
But any coins he puts on my eyes, I keep.

Done.
I certainly have been.

A funeral dirge.

She's dead?
Yeah.

Then I shall kill myself.

It's against roman law
To take one's own life.

01:14:28,799 --> 01:14:31,301
Captain?
I've had no instructions.

1151
01:14:31,301 --> 01:14:34,304
The captain sent for me
Especially.

1152
01:14:34,304 --> 01:14:38,808
Oh, do let me by,
And I'll redeem this...

1153
01:14:38,809 --> 01:14:41,311
In ways that'll melt
Every bolt in your armour.

1154
01:14:41,311 --> 01:14:44,314
Is it real?
Bite it and see.

1155
01:14:44,314 --> 01:14:46,316
And that goes for me too.

1156
01:15:03,333 --> 01:15:06,336
Strew the soil

1157
01:15:06,336 --> 01:15:08,338
Strum the lyre

Build the pyre

1160
01:15:14,845 --> 01:15:17,347
Pyre?
What kind of pyre?

1161
01:15:17,347 --> 01:15:19,349
A pyre of fire.

1162
01:15:19,349 --> 01:15:21,351
Oh, a fire pyre.

1163
01:15:22,853 --> 01:15:25,355
<i>- [ Miles ]
she must be burned. - burned?</i>

1164
01:15:25,355 --> 01:15:28,358
- I want her ashes.
- ashes?  ow!

1165
01:15:28,358 --> 01:15:32,362
Captain!  captain!
Captain, I implore you.

1166
01:15:32,362 --> 01:15:35,865
It is not for us
To destroy such loveliness.

1167
01:15:35,866 --> 01:15:37,868
The gods are awaiting her.

1168
01:15:37,868 --> 01:15:40,871
They would be angry
If we sent up a smoked virgin.

1169
01:15:41,371 --> 01:15:43,873
I cannot afford
To offend the gods. who can?

1170
01:15:44,374 --> 01:15:45,875
I will go
My melancholy way.

1171
01:15:46,376 --> 01:15:48,878
Very good, sir.
Good-bye, sir.

1172
01:15:48,879 --> 01:15:51,381
Wait!

1173
01:15:51,381 --> 01:15:53,883
A farewell kiss.
Of course.

1174
01:15:53,884 --> 01:15:56,887
Not you.

1175
01:15:56,887 --> 01:15:59,890
You mustn't!
It could make you very sick.

1176
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:03,393
The truth is, captain,
She died of an illness contracted on crete.

1177
01:16:03,393 --> 01:16:06,896
What illness?
The plague. [ shouts ]

1182
01:16:24,915 --> 01:16:27,417
There is no plague.
What?

1183
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:30,420
I have this day
Returned from crete, and there is no plague.

1184
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:33,423
Then what was everyone
Yelling about?

1185
01:16:33,423 --> 01:16:35,925
I seek the--
Find me the captain. don't stand there.

1186

Will you--  you, find me
The captain.  i--

1187
01:16:38,929 --> 01:16:41,431
Oh, sir,
I bring wonderful news.

1188
01:16:41,431 --> 01:16:43,433
The virgin
Does not have the plague.

1189
01:16:43,433 --> 01:16:46,436
Silence, woman.
I know that. she died of other causes.

1190
01:16:46,436 --> 01:16:49,439
Died?  how--
She was a ba--  how--

1191
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:53,443
Poor little moth.
She fluttered too near my flame.

1192

Too filled with love.
Dear little heart.

1193
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:59,282
Heart?
Yes, that's it.

1194
01:16:59,282 --> 01:17:02,285
I shall cut out her heart
And carry it with me forever more. [ yelling ]

1195
01:17:02,285 --> 01:17:04,787
This girl's alive!
And she's gonna stay that way!

1196
01:17:04,788 --> 01:17:07,791
[ shouting ]
Seize her! I'll get her!

1197
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:12,796
Seize everyone!
Put the whole neighborhood to the sword!

1198
01:17:12,796 --> 01:17:16,800
Sir, a question.
If I found your maiden, would you spare my--

1199
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,803
A moment, please.
If the maiden is not found,

1200
01:17:19,803 --> 01:17:22,305
I shall destroy not only
This house, [ woman screaming ]

1201
01:17:22,305 --> 01:17:25,808
But all surrounding houses
And every single person in them!

1202
01:17:25,809 --> 01:17:28,311
And now, madam,
Your question?

1203
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:30,813
Oh, it's just a silly
Girlish idea. I'll find your maiden.

1204
01:17:30,814 --> 01:17:33,316
Ah!  now, then,
My beauty!

1205
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:35,318
Redeem your promise.
[ grunts ]

1206

Ah, you wildcat.
You're beautiful when you're angry.

1207
01:17:40,824 --> 01:17:44,828
Ruined!  ruined!
All we have to do is find hero and Philia.  oh!

1208
01:17:44,828 --> 01:17:48,832
<i>- do you see what she said?
- what is it? and please don't tell me.</i>

1209
01:17:48,832 --> 01:17:50,834
Philia is sacrificing herself
At the temple of virgins.

- hero is throwing himself
To the lions. - seize them!

I'll save hero
And meet you there!

1213
01:18:00,844 --> 01:18:03,346
The same thing happened
29 years ago.

1214

<i>- I might just as well go in--
- [ guard ]  hey!</i>

1215
01:18:06,349 --> 01:18:08,851
I'll wager you never got
My nose sharpened either.

1216
01:18:08,852 --> 01:18:12,355
<i>I would like to know
what it is you do that makes you so tired.</i>

1217

Never too tired--

Hey.

1220

I wish to throw myself
To the lions. where do I go?

1221

- pompeii?
- I beg your pardon?

1222
01:18:32,075 --> 01:18:35,578
No performance here today.
Gladiators are just doing training.

1223
01:18:35,579 --> 01:18:38,081
Training?
Training.

1224
01:18:40,083 --> 01:18:43,086
Come on,
You miserable slaves, move.

Here you are. lot four.

Move, you slaves.
Move.  move!

Okay, come along.
Keep moving.

Over there.
Get in line.  in line.

How are you?
All right? had a good day?

1231
01:19:01,605 --> 01:19:04,107
Easy swing.

Hero!
Master hero! wait here.

1233

Hey, hey!  we're closed
To members of the public.

- that young man that
Just went in, I must see him. - you'll see him.

They should be
Bringing him out any minute.

1236

Now, the secret
Of the action-- hmm?

1237
01:19:30,133 --> 01:19:33,136
The secret of the action
Is in the wrist.

1238
01:19:33,136 --> 01:19:36,639
It's got to flow.
You're jerking.

1239

There.  there.

1240
01:19:40,644 --> 01:19:43,647
No.  now, think of it as
An extension of your arm.

1241
01:19:43,647 --> 01:19:45,649
You tightened up
At the last minute, didn't you?

1242
01:19:45,649 --> 01:19:47,651
You're worrying about it
Too much.

1243
01:19:47,651 --> 01:19:50,654
Try and sort of just
Do a couple without thinking about it, eh?

1244
01:19:51,154 --> 01:19:53,156
Go ahead.

1245
01:19:54,658 --> 01:19:57,661
- aw.  that even felt better,
Didn't it? - yeah.

I'm always better
In trainin'. yes. [ chuckling ]

Don't worry.

<i>just--  now-now, relax.</i>

Relax.  you see, he sort of...
Went very strange.  right.

1250

No.
Wrist jerk again.

1251
01:20:28,692 --> 01:20:32,195

Uh, please. do you mind?

1253
01:20:39,703 --> 01:20:42,706
[ grunting ]
No, that's a nasty, messy one.

1254
01:20:42,706 --> 01:20:44,708
That fellow whistling
Put you off.

1255
01:20:44,708 --> 01:20:47,210
<i>he's the last one.
It's not worth sending for another dozen.</i>

Come on.  let's see
If we can put this one straight into nero's box.

Still jerking the wrist.

Right.

Now back to rome
For a quick wedding and some slow executions.

1317
01:30:39,018 --> 01:30:44,023
You slave--  you will be
Torn apart by a team of wild horses, slowly,

1318
01:30:44,023 --> 01:30:47,026
To the plaudits of my troops
And the amusement of the children.

1319
01:30:47,026 --> 01:30:50,029
But you, my dear,
Have nothing to fear.

1320
01:30:50,029 --> 01:30:53,532
Although you fled from me,
I have the greatness to forgive.

1321
01:30:53,532 --> 01:30:55,534
I, too, can forgive.

1322
01:30:55,534 --> 01:30:57,536
No one can part us now.

1323
01:30:59,538 --> 01:31:01,540
Show me the swine
Who did that,

1324
01:31:01,540 --> 01:31:04,543
And I'll break
Every bone in his body.

My sweet.

1330
01:31:28,067 --> 01:31:31,070
Why do all the men
Find me so attractive?

- my daughter, a eunuch?
- soldier, seize that man!

1338
01:31:55,094 --> 01:31:58,097
Captain, I can explain.
What? this can't be.

1339
01:31:58,097 --> 01:32:01,100
The leper.  unclean!

1340
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:03,102

And no woman.

Am Marcus Lycus.

<i>The gaggle of geese.
[ Miles ] what did you say, old man?</i>

1347

I have worn this ring since
I was a foundling child. my son!

1348
01:32:25,624 --> 01:32:28,627
- father!
- you've grown.

1349

1350
01:32:32,131 --> 01:32:36,635

01:32:47,146 --> 01:32:50,649
Dear old man, I take it
Your daughter was freeborn? without a doubt.

1356
01:32:50,649 --> 01:32:55,153
Lycus, we all know
The penalty for selling a freeborn citizen.
