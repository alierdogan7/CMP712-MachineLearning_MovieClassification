1
00:01:11,311 --> 00:01:14,181
Now listen, men.
Spring is here...

2
00:01:14,287 --> 00:01:18,444
and spring is a dangerous time
of the year, especially in Paris.

3
00:01:18,543 --> 00:01:22,089
The wanderlust is in the air.
Travelers are coming here from everywhere -

4
00:01:22,192 --> 00:01:24,613
from Cincinnati and Singapore.

5
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,753
- Now, what do they come for?
- [Together] We know.

6
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:33,158
That's right. Chicago packers
don't come here for a plate of cold cuts.

7
00:01:33,264 --> 00:01:37,038
Big planters don't come
from Brazil just for nuts.

8
00:01:37,135 --> 00:01:40,616
From Norway and Sweden,
they don't come here to fish.

9
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,356
But whether they come from
Amsterdam or Birmingham or Siam...

10
00:01:45,455 --> 00:01:48,008
we let them do whatever they wish.

11
00:01:48,111 --> 00:01:50,054
We let them play in any way...

12
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,014
as long as they're willing to pay.

13
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,421
[Together]
That's okay.

14
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,723
But spring is here.

15
00:01:55,823 --> 00:01:59,336
And after dark, our cafés are empty.

16
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,302
But every park has
standing room only every night.

17
00:02:03,407 --> 00:02:05,829
- Now that's wrong.
- That's right.

18
00:02:05,935 --> 00:02:08,521
The situation is not funny.

19
00:02:08,623 --> 00:02:11,623
Our best cafés are losing money.

20
00:02:11,727 --> 00:02:13,866
We must clean up the public parks.

21
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,171
We must clean up the public parks.

22
00:02:16,272 --> 00:02:20,265
Here's your slogan:
Cleaner parks and more prosperity.

23
00:02:20,367 --> 00:02:23,782
[All] Cleaner parks. Cleaner parks.
More prosperity. More prosperity.

24
00:02:46,832 --> 00:02:49,287
Come on. Come on.
Where do you think you are?

25
00:02:49,391 --> 00:02:51,366
What are you doing?
What's going on here?

26
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,505
The French Revolution.

27
00:02:55,632 --> 00:02:58,185
Hey! You can't make love in public.

28
00:02:58,287 --> 00:03:00,392
- I can make love anywhere.
- No, you can't.

29
00:03:00,495 --> 00:03:04,935
- Oh, but, Officer, he can.
- Darling!

30
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:07,722
Get up.

31
00:03:07,823 --> 00:03:11,303
- What's your name?
- Dr. Bertier.

32
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:13,546
And your name?

33
00:03:13,647 --> 00:03:15,535
Madame Bertier.

34
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:19,592
- So you're married, eh?
- Yes, Officer.

35
00:03:19,695 --> 00:03:21,550
And you expect me to believe that?

36
00:03:21,648 --> 00:03:24,331
- Oh, please.
- Please.

37
00:03:24,432 --> 00:03:26,537
Now let me tell you something.

38
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,284
You're the only married couple
in this park.

39
00:03:30,384 --> 00:03:32,522
[Chuckles]
Get out!

40
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,308
Well, there's only
one other place to go.

41
00:03:39,503 --> 00:03:41,390
Why not?

42
00:03:42,607 --> 00:03:45,990
Listen, Officer.
Do you see that moon?

43
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:49,095
If he could talk French,
do you know what he would say to you?

44
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:51,021
Phooey.

45
00:04:22,543 --> 00:04:25,991
Ladies and gentlemen,
I must talk to you.

46
00:04:26,095 --> 00:04:29,510
This is a very delicate situation.

47
00:04:29,615 --> 00:04:33,030
There is Colette,
and here am I.

48
00:04:33,135 --> 00:04:36,299
And I know what you think.
Oh! I know.

49
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:38,766
How dare you.

50
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:41,099
You remember that policeman?

51
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,395
He was wrong.
And so are you.

52
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:48,140
Believe it or not,
we are married.

53
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:50,443
I am her husband.

54
00:04:50,543 --> 00:04:53,358
And she is my wife.

55
00:04:53,456 --> 00:04:55,278
And I can prove it to you.

56
00:04:55,376 --> 00:04:58,954
Oh, look.
This is a picture of our wedding.

57
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,940
Myself and the bridesmaids.

58
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,079
And this is my wife.

59
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,629
Before the wedding, naturally.

60
00:05:10,736 --> 00:05:12,623
And look at this lady.

61
00:05:15,695 --> 00:05:17,637
My mother-in-law.

62
00:05:17,743 --> 00:05:19,653
A marvelous cook.

63
00:05:21,552 --> 00:05:25,861
In other words,
I am married, and I like it.

64
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:27,909
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

65
00:05:29,071 --> 00:05:31,493
Now, gentlemen, as a doctor...

66
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:35,015
let me ask you a personal question.

67
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:38,119
How long since you have been in a park?

68
00:05:38,224 --> 00:05:41,093
I mean - I mean, with your wife.

69
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,844
Ah. Ladies, that's what's wrong.

70
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:48,970

- I don't know whether to laugh or scream.
- # I'm on fire #

685
00:50:56,077 --> 00:50:58,727
- I want you to leave this house at once.
- # Have a heart ##

686
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,234
Andre!

687
00:51:24,332 --> 00:51:27,082
You'll have to call louder than that
if you want Andre to hear you.

688
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:30,377
But if you want Adolph,
all you have to do is whisper.

689
00:51:31,884 --> 00:51:34,884
Oh.
[Crying]

690
00:51:42,061 --> 00:51:44,908
Sorrow makes you look
even more beautiful.

691
00:51:45,004 --> 00:51:47,393
Thank you, Adolph.

692
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,770
More feminine...

693
00:51:49,868 --> 00:51:51,690
younger.

694
00:51:51,788 --> 00:51:54,309
- Do you really think so?
- I do, Colette.

695
00:51:54,412 --> 00:51:56,300
Oh, thank you, Adolph.

696
00:51:56,396 --> 00:51:58,284
[Sobbing]

697
00:51:59,341 --> 00:52:01,675
Any man who leaves
a woman like you...

698
00:52:01,772 --> 00:52:05,001
on a night like this,
with a man like me...

699
00:52:05,101 --> 00:52:06,923
deserves it.

700
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:10,087
But it was my fault.
I was wrong.

701
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,380
You have a right to be wrong.

702
00:52:13,485 --> 00:52:16,551
You're a woman.
Women are born to be wrong.

703
00:52:18,604 --> 00:52:20,426
I like my women wrong.

704
00:52:21,421 --> 00:52:23,243
You poor, lonely little thing.

705
00:52:23,341 --> 00:52:25,828
Oh, I'm so unappy.

706
00:52:27,564 --> 00:52:30,728
- You need love.
- Yes. Love.

707
00:52:30,828 --> 00:52:32,650
Lots of love.

708
00:52:32,748 --> 00:52:34,570
Lots of love.

709
00:53:23,276 --> 00:53:26,658
## [Whistling]

710
00:54:43,532 --> 00:54:45,954
Get out! Get out,
or I'll call my husband!

711
00:54:59,724 --> 00:55:02,888
- Oh, darling.
- My dear, how excited you seem.

712
00:55:02,988 --> 00:55:05,770
I just had a dream,
a terrible dream.

713
00:55:05,868 --> 00:55:09,513
I dreamed that last night, when you
were gone, I was downstairs alone and -

714
00:55:09,612 --> 00:55:11,173
Yes, yes? Go on.

715
00:55:11,276 --> 00:55:14,659
Suddenly a man took hold of me.
I - I struggled, and he -

716
00:55:14,764 --> 00:55:16,586
- Choked you?
- No.

717
00:55:16,684 --> 00:55:18,506
- Shot you?
- No.

718
00:55:18,604 --> 00:55:20,426
What did he do?

719
00:55:21,644 --> 00:55:23,467
He kissed me.

720
00:55:23,564 --> 00:55:25,899
Oh. Kissed you.

721
00:55:25,997 --> 00:55:29,292
[Chuckling]
Your dream shall come true.

722
00:55:36,588 --> 00:55:38,628
But the man wasrt you.

723
00:55:38,732 --> 00:55:40,837
Someone I know?

724
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:43,045
- He's your pal.
- What a pal!

725
00:55:43,148 --> 00:55:45,831
- It was Adolph.
- Oh, no. Not Adolph.

726
00:55:45,932 --> 00:55:49,544
[Laughs] That's a scream.
It couldn't be Adolph, even in a dream!

727
00:55:51,276 --> 00:55:53,381
Adolph!

728
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:56,615
#And still I feel guilty #

729
00:55:56,717 --> 00:56:01,473
# It doesn't seem right #

730
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:05,638
# But you shouldn't leave me #

731
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:09,799
#At night #

732
00:56:09,901 --> 00:56:12,356
# Day after day #

733
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:15,046
#We will always be sweethearts #

734
00:56:15,148 --> 00:56:17,766
#The same as the day #

735
00:56:17,868 --> 00:56:21,000
#We began #

736
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:23,588
# Dream what I may #

737
00:56:23,692 --> 00:56:26,791
#We will always be sweethearts #

738
00:56:26,892 --> 00:56:32,772
# My lips are for no other man #

739
00:56:32,876 --> 00:56:35,145
# Dear, never fear #

740
00:56:35,244 --> 00:56:37,633
# I won't ever neglect you #

741
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:40,708
# Each night I'll be here #

742
00:56:40,812 --> 00:56:44,609
#To adore and protect you #

743
00:56:44,717 --> 00:56:48,361
#And year after year #

744
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:52,137
#We will always be sweethearts #

745
00:56:52,236 --> 00:56:57,321
#The same as the day #

746
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:03,432
#We began ##

747
00:57:05,068 --> 00:57:07,523
- <i>[Knocklng]</i>
- <i>[Colette] Come In.</i>

748
00:57:17,772 --> 00:57:19,594
Darling, whatever-

749
00:57:29,836 --> 00:57:31,941
- Professor!
- Doctor.

750
00:57:32,044 --> 00:57:35,143
- Oh, it's nice of you to drop in.
- Uh-huh.

751
00:57:35,244 --> 00:57:37,415
- We missed you a lot last night.
- [Chuckles]

752
00:57:37,516 --> 00:57:40,102
- [Chuckles] Wort you sit down?
- Thank you. Yes.

753
00:57:47,308 --> 00:57:49,196
- Excuse me one minute.
- Yes.

754
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:56,198
- Uh, it's a bit drafty, eh?
- <i>Yes.</i>

755
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:02,602
Did you, uh, have
a good time last night?

756
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:05,351
Well, we -we tried our best.

757
00:58:05,452 --> 00:58:07,787
First we had, uh -we had dinner.

758
00:58:07,884 --> 00:58:09,706
Then we danced.

759
00:58:09,803 --> 00:58:12,105
And then we -we played a little.

760
00:58:12,204 --> 00:58:14,440
Played? May I ask what?

761
00:58:15,436 --> 00:58:17,574
- Cards.
- Cards?

762
00:58:17,676 --> 00:58:19,499
Bridge.

763
00:58:20,844 --> 00:58:23,233
You didn't play cards
last night, Doctor.

764
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:25,348
Oh! Professor.

765
00:58:25,452 --> 00:58:27,274
I ought to know.
[Chuckling]

766
00:58:27,372 --> 00:58:29,706
You were in my apartment
last night.

767
00:58:29,804 --> 00:58:32,488
- In your apartment?
- Mm-hmm.

768
00:58:32,588 --> 00:58:34,476
Let me see.

769
00:58:36,396 --> 00:58:38,884
You left your house...

770
00:58:38,988 --> 00:58:41,509
at 2:10.

771
00:58:41,612 --> 00:58:44,361
You went to the corner,
jumped into a cab.

772
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:46,664
My wife was in that cab.

773
00:58:48,012 --> 00:58:50,215
Yes. Yes, that's true.

774
00:58:50,316 --> 00:58:52,421
That's absolutely true.

775
00:58:52,524 --> 00:58:56,801
Uh, your-your wife -
your wife was alone.

776
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:59,297
See, naturally, as her host...

777
00:58:59,404 --> 00:59:02,219
I wanted to see her
get home safely.

778
00:59:02,316 --> 00:59:04,203
Thank you
for protecting my wife, Doctor.

779
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:07,398
- It was only my duty, Professor.
- Yes.

780
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:11,690
Now, let me see -The car arrived
in front of my house at 2:35.

781
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:15,399
You and my wife
stayed in the car...

782
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,736
for eight minutes...

783
00:59:17,836 --> 00:59:19,843
up to 2:43.

784
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:23,467
Right. Right.

785
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:28,675
Your-Your wife just -
just asked me something.

786
00:59:29,739 --> 00:59:31,779
And then I answered.

787
00:59:31,884 --> 00:59:34,469
Then another question,
and then another answer.

788
00:59:34,572 --> 00:59:37,289
One question follows an answer.
You know? [Chuckling]

789
00:59:37,388 --> 00:59:40,257
Eight minutes -
Eight minutes can go like that!

790
00:59:40,364 --> 00:59:41,924
Yes. Yes.

791
00:59:42,028 --> 00:59:44,581
Then you, uh -
you got out of the car.

792
00:59:44,684 --> 00:59:46,921
You went to the house,
and at the door...

793
00:59:47,019 --> 00:59:49,059
my wife handed you the key.

794
00:59:49,164 --> 00:59:50,986
You unlocked the door...

795
00:59:51,084 --> 00:59:54,379
and after a short conversation,
you went in.

796
00:59:54,476 --> 00:59:58,666
This was exactly 2:51.

797
00:59:58,764 --> 01:00:01,098
Uh -Am I boring you?

798
01:00:01,196 --> 01:00:03,432
Oh, not at all, Professor.

799
01:00:03,532 --> 01:00:07,242
Uh, yes, y-your wife -
your wife said...

800
01:00:07,339 --> 01:00:09,674
"Wort you come up
and have a little brandy?"

801
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:13,481
And I said,
"Ah, a little brandy can't hurt."

802
01:00:14,956 --> 01:00:17,127
- So, I - I went up.
- Yes.

803
01:00:17,228 --> 01:00:20,425
And, uh -
And you had the brandy?

804
01:00:21,676 --> 01:00:23,237
Yes.

805
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:25,445
Was it good brandy, Doctor?

806
01:00:25,548 --> 01:00:27,435
Excellent, Professor.

807
01:00:28,428 --> 01:00:31,941
You drank this brandy
from 2:53...

808
01:00:33,099 --> 01:00:34,954
to 4:44.

809
01:00:37,324 --> 01:00:40,553
Professor, I assure you...

810
01:00:40,652 --> 01:00:43,335
that there is
absolutely nothing wrong.

811
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:47,787
We just -We just had a chat...

812
01:00:47,884 --> 01:00:49,706
and a few laughs.

813
01:00:49,804 --> 01:00:53,153
You know, y-your wife -
your wife is very amusing.

814
01:00:53,259 --> 01:00:56,009
Yes, everyone says so.
It must be true.

815
01:00:56,108 --> 01:00:59,621
Now, Professor,
all appearances are against me.

816
01:00:59,723 --> 01:01:01,763
I know. I know.
But let me tell you again -

817
01:01:01,868 --> 01:01:04,072
Not another word, Doctor.

818
01:01:04,171 --> 01:01:07,401
- I believe you.
- Thank you.

819
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,922
You're very welcome.
I believe you.

820
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:14,532
But no one else will. [Chuckles]
Too bad, isn't it?

821
01:01:14,635 --> 01:01:17,417
I just came up here this morning
to ask you...

822
01:01:17,515 --> 01:01:20,832
if you would appear,
voluntarily, as a...

823
01:01:22,092 --> 01:01:25,572
shall we say, witness
in my divorce suit?

824
01:01:25,676 --> 01:01:27,945
[Chuckles]

825
01:01:28,044 --> 01:01:30,597
Professor, please believe me.

826
01:01:31,596 --> 01:01:33,701
I'm an innocent man.

827
01:01:33,804 --> 01:01:37,382
I'm not guilty.
And neither is Mitzi.

828
01:01:37,484 --> 01:01:39,371
I mean - I mean, your wife.

829
01:01:39,468 --> 01:01:42,315
My friend -
May I call you my friend?

830
01:01:42,412 --> 01:01:45,030
- Please.
- My friend, nobody is guilty.

831
01:01:45,132 --> 01:01:49,474
I have a theory that nobody
is responsible for their actions.

832
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:52,231
Right!
That's absolutely right.

833
01:01:52,331 --> 01:01:56,106
Our doings are controlled by circumstances
over which we have no control.

834
01:01:56,204 --> 01:02:00,066
Oh, excellent.
Truer words have never been spoken.

835
01:02:00,172 --> 01:02:03,303
Therefore, nobody can
be held responsible for his actions.

836
01:02:03,404 --> 01:02:06,153
Oh, what a beautiful thought,
Professor.

837
01:02:06,252 --> 01:02:08,139
You know -
You know that you're a poet?

838
01:02:08,236 --> 01:02:12,360
[Chuckles] This, of course, has nothing
whatever to do with our case.

839
01:02:14,859 --> 01:02:16,834
- Good morning, Professor.
- Madame.

840
01:02:16,939 --> 01:02:19,306
Ah, I'm so glad you dropped in.

841
01:02:19,403 --> 01:02:21,291
We should see each other
more often.

842
01:02:21,387 --> 01:02:25,162
[Chuckles]
I'm afraid the doctor doesn't like me.

843
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:28,260
Oh, Professor.
Where did you get such an idea?

844
01:02:29,484 --> 01:02:31,589
Oh, by the way, how's Mitzi?

845
01:02:31,691 --> 01:02:33,546
- Mitzi?
- Yes.

846
01:02:33,644 --> 01:02:37,027
Oh, Mitzi. Uh, let me see.

847
01:02:37,132 --> 01:02:39,336
She left this morning for Lausanne.

848
01:02:39,436 --> 01:02:41,475
- Lausanne?
- Mmm.

849
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:44,231
- Oh, to see her mother.
- I suppose so.

850
01:02:45,579 --> 01:02:48,895
- I hope nothing's happened to her mother.
- To her mother?

851
01:02:49,004 --> 01:02:51,208
No, I don't think so.

852
01:02:51,308 --> 01:02:54,723
Well, we'll see.
I'm sorry, but I must be going now.

853
01:02:54,827 --> 01:02:57,958
Well, you must come again sometime.

854
01:02:58,059 --> 01:03:01,158
And when you write Mitzi,
you'll give her my best regards, won't you?

855
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:03,943
Oh, I surely will.
And yours, Doctor?

856
01:03:04,939 --> 01:03:06,762

You know who the man is?

- This Russian artist Rodovsky.
