Treasure Island

8
00:00:27,702 --> 00:00:29,159
Did not appear

9
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:31,191
but

10
00:00:33,772 --> 00:00:36,566
voiced the characters of:

11
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:40,239
Jim Hawkins, Billy Bones, Black Dog,
Blind Pew, Doctor Livesey...

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,398
...Squire Trelawney, John Silver,
Capt. Smollett and the pirates...

13
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:09,244
All the heroes of this sordid story,
from buccaneer to a hapless drunk,

14
00:01:09,473 --> 00:01:13,731
will gather here in their pirate glory,
where Flint buried an old treasure trunk.

15
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,361
The tale begins with an old sea-chart.
To get it, quite a few will lay their bones.

16
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:24,789
A tiny island, peaceful as an orchard,
will end up scattered with tombstones.

The "Treasure Island"

18
00:01:31,431 --> 00:01:34,446

The "Treasure Island"

22
00:01:43,462 --> 00:01:46,589
On every other page,
fights in drunken rage,

23
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:50,276
Louis-d'ors and bullets sing their song.

24
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:54,818
There's fights with guns and rapiers
Intrigues, betrayals, chases, homicide!

25
00:01:54,918 --> 00:01:58,906
And all of that for just a roll of paper
that has some sort of plan on it inside.

26
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,248
And all of that for money, money, money,
The root of all that's evil, as they say!

27
00:02:03,348 --> 00:02:06,133
They come for me,
I thank you for the pleasure,

28
00:02:06,233 --> 00:02:09,020
It's murder time, and I must run away.

Part 1: The Chart of Captain Flint

37
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:57,142
[Admiral Benbow]

38
00:05:01,164 --> 00:05:02,687
- Who's up at this time of night?

39
00:05:02,786 --> 00:05:07,656
Mother always said: "At night, people
should sleep. And during the day..."

40
00:05:07,881 --> 00:05:08,928
Who is there?

41
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,726
- This is a pleasant harbour.

42
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,823
Not a bad spot for a layover.

43
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,466
Not too crowded, is it, lad?

44
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,039
- Not very crowded, sir.

45
00:05:59,787 --> 00:06:04,656
- Very well then, looks like a good
place for me to drop my anchor.

46
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:08,876
I'll stay here for a little while.

47
00:06:10,698 --> 00:06:15,293
Rum, bacon, and scrambled eggs,
that's all I will require.

48
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:54,467
- Come here, boy!

49
00:06:56,189 --> 00:07:01,008
If you see a sailor with only
one leg, call me right away.

50
00:07:01,108 --> 00:07:04,004
For your trouble you'll get five,
no four...

51
00:07:05,902 --> 00:07:11,295
three, three silver pennies,
once a month.

52
00:07:11,395 --> 00:07:14,790
So, keep your eyes peeled.

53
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:16,888
- Yes, sir.

54
00:07:17,238 --> 00:07:21,881
- Nice boy. Nice pl...

55
00:08:11,843 --> 00:08:13,665
- Ladies and gentlemen!

56
00:08:13,765 --> 00:08:20,829
You will now hear a sad but instructive
story about a boy called Bobby.

57
00:08:20,929 --> 00:08:22,952
Who loved...

58
00:08:23,976 --> 00:08:25,924
Who loved money.

59
00:08:26,524 --> 00:08:28,022
Begin!

60
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:33,565
Our Bobby was jolly and kind little tot.

61
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:38,408
A hobby he had, he loved money a lot.

62
00:08:38,882 --> 00:08:42,029
It was his soft spot.

63
00:08:42,204 --> 00:08:46,197
All children like children,
no worry or care.

64
00:08:46,347 --> 00:08:50,917
But Bob's on a diet, his table is bare.

65
00:08:51,017 --> 00:08:52,565
He's saving the fare.

66
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:57,458
Money-shmoney, money-shmoney,
day or night you do your best!

67
00:08:57,558 --> 00:09:00,105
Make more money!
Make more money!

68
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:04,974
And to hell with all the rest!

69
00:09:05,523 --> 00:09:07,196
- Then what?

70
00:09:08,395 --> 00:09:12,064
A penny, a shilling,
and then a whole pound.

71
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:16,209
Our Bob soon became
a con-artist renowned.

72
00:09:16,484 --> 00:09:19,280
The word got around.

73
00:09:19,455 --> 00:09:22,776
He wasn't alone, our poor little tot.

74
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:26,721
There's plenty of guys
who love money a lot.

75
00:09:26,822 --> 00:09:28,168
He simply forgot.

76
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:32,814
Money-shmoney, money-shmoney,
day or night you do your best!

77
00:09:32,914 --> 00:09:35,633
Make more money!
Make more money!

78
00:09:37,332 --> 00:09:39,579
And to hell with all the rest!

79
00:09:41,927 --> 00:09:44,597
- Dance, pop-eye!

80
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:57,132
- Ladies and gentlemen!
Please spare some change, if you can.

81
00:10:04,222 --> 00:10:05,445
[Billy Bones]

82
00:10:06,795 --> 00:10:08,118
A.k.a "The Captain."

83
00:10:08,218 --> 00:10:11,837
Owner of the chart of the Treasure Island.

84
00:10:12,062 --> 00:10:14,458
Drinks a lot and always has a cold.

85
00:10:14,558 --> 00:10:17,156
Nasty temper. Not married.

86
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:16,154
- Come here, my boy.

87
00:11:16,254 --> 00:11:19,499
Is this for my friend, skipper Billy?

88
00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:22,248
- Sir, I don't know any skippers.

89
00:11:22,522 --> 00:11:26,615
This breakfast is for our tenant
who we call "the Captain."

90
00:11:27,116 --> 00:11:30,985
- You could call my friend
"the Captain," too.

91
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:37,676
He has a scar on his face and very kindly
manners, especially when he's drunk.

92
00:11:40,248 --> 00:11:43,144
So, this is where Billy lives?

93
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,740
- If you mean the Captain, sir,
then he's off for a walk.

94
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:50,810
- Oh, Billy will be as glad to see me
just as he would a good drink.

95
00:11:51,834 --> 00:11:54,505
Speak of the devil, there he is.

96
00:11:54,904 --> 00:11:57,926
Let's surprise him, shall we.

97
00:11:58,201 --> 00:11:59,921
- Yes, sir.

98
00:12:06,414 --> 00:12:10,534
- Billy! Don't you recognize me, Billy?

99
00:12:10,808 --> 00:12:14,529
Don't recognize your old mate?

100
00:12:21,818 --> 00:12:24,216
- Black Dog?

101
00:12:24,665 --> 00:12:26,989
- That's me!

102
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:32,256
I wanted to check up on an old ship-mate.

103
00:12:32,655 --> 00:12:35,077
- All right, since you
tracked me down anyway.

104
00:12:35,975 --> 00:12:38,623
Spit it out, why are you here?

105
00:12:39,347 --> 00:12:42,243
- Where's the chart, Billy?

106
00:12:43,365 --> 00:12:46,038
We want the chart!

107
00:12:46,637 --> 00:12:50,606
- What chart? I don't have any charts!

108
00:12:50,931 --> 00:12:53,379
- The chart! Where is it?!

109
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:56,100
- I don't have any charts!

110
00:12:56,574 --> 00:12:59,771
No! No! I won't!

111
00:13:12,304 --> 00:13:15,250
[Black Dog]

112
00:13:15,575 --> 00:13:16,698
Old friend of Flint's.

113
00:13:16,924 --> 00:13:19,371
Seeks the chart of the Treasure Island.

114
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:22,092
Shady temper. Not married.

115
00:14:19,966 --> 00:14:21,340
- More rum!

116
00:14:22,664 --> 00:14:24,486
- You're injured, sir.

117
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:30,777
- Jim, my boy! Get me some rum
and then I'm out of here!

118
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,167
- Doctor! Doctor, quick!

119
00:14:40,988 --> 00:14:46,184
- Hello there, I'm Doctor Livesey!
What seems to be the matter?

120
00:14:46,607 --> 00:14:49,079
[Doctor Livesey]

121
00:14:49,428 --> 00:14:51,550
A very good and cheerful person.

122
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,498
Temper extroverted. Not married.

123
00:14:54,722 --> 00:14:56,843
- Doctor, help! The Captain is injured.

124
00:14:56,944 --> 00:15:04,633
- Injured? Nonsense! He just had a stroke
from liking rum too much.

125
00:15:05,433 --> 00:15:12,674
All right, let's rescue this
total waste of human life.

126
00:15:13,422 --> 00:15:17,376
Enlarged liver, very good!
Enlarged spleen, excellent!

127
00:15:17,692 --> 00:15:21,110
Arrhythmia, just lovely! Very splendid!

128
00:15:21,331 --> 00:15:25,666
- Where's Black Dog?
- Settle down! There are no dogs here.

129
00:15:25,766 --> 00:15:30,413
Remember: if you don't stop drinking,
you will very soon die.

130
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:37,976
The words "rum" and "death" should mean
the same thing to you. Do you understand?

131
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:42,373
Good bye, Jim, my boy.

132
00:15:43,893 --> 00:15:49,555
- Listen, Jim.
I must get out of here, and quick.

133
00:15:50,221 --> 00:15:53,320
Otherwise they'll send me
the "black spot."

134
00:15:55,282 --> 00:15:58,068
- What's that, sir?

135
00:15:58,511 --> 00:16:01,196
- It's like a verdict, lad.

136
00:16:01,296 --> 00:16:08,065
They're after my trunk,
and if they show up here...

137
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:11,798
Listen up, Jim.

138
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:18,127
If they show up here, then get on a horse
and get to that doctor.

139
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:23,063
He can then get the entire Flint's gang.

140
00:16:25,594 --> 00:16:30,056
On board of the Admiral Benbow!
Get them all!

141
00:16:48,979 --> 00:16:52,206
[Blind Pew]

142
00:16:52,306 --> 00:16:55,622
Old friend of Flint's.
Cunning and greedy.

143
00:16:55,721 --> 00:16:57,806
Will do anything for money.

144
00:16:57,906 --> 00:17:00,305
Atrocious temper. Not married.

145
00:17:11,317 --> 00:17:18,436
- Could you tell this poor blind man,
who lost his precious eyesight...

146
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:22,548
...in the name of selflessly protecting
his motherland England...

147
00:17:22,738 --> 00:17:26,852
...just where exactly he happens to be?

148
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:32,359
- Next to the Admiral Benbow inn,
in the Black Hill Harbour.

149
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:37,040
- I hear a voice. A young voice.

150
00:17:37,578 --> 00:17:43,686
Give me your hand, young man,
and lead me into the house.

151
00:17:45,584 --> 00:17:49,192
And now, boy, lead me to The Captain.

152
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,102
- Sir, I wouldn't dare.

153
00:17:52,202 --> 00:17:58,020
- Won't dare, huh?
Lead, or I'll break your arm!

154
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:04,600
And when The Captains sees me,
yell "here's your friend, Billy!"

155
00:18:06,593 --> 00:18:09,409
- Here's your friend, Billy.

156
00:18:12,068 --> 00:18:15,865
- Oh, god. Pew!

157
00:18:19,883 --> 00:18:23,617
- It's okay, Billy, stay where you are.

158
00:18:23,717 --> 00:18:28,711
I can't see you, but I can hear
the trembling of your fingers.

159
00:18:28,811 --> 00:18:34,944
Stretch out your right arm
and get it close to mine.

160
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:42,976
Now it's done.

161
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,839
Good bye, Billy.

162
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,804
Good boy.

163
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:54,557
- Good bye!

164
00:19:00,951 --> 00:19:03,299
- The Black Spot.

165
00:19:05,551 --> 00:19:10,607
Listen, Jim!
This Blind Pew is a dangerous man.

166
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:15,695
But the one-legged one who sent him
is even more dangerous.

167
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:20,525
Do not let him get the chart.
You hear? Do not!

168
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:25,907
It's in my trunk.
I alone know that place.

169
00:19:26,007 --> 00:19:30,017
Old Flint himself gave me
that chart before he died.

170
00:19:31,486 --> 00:19:35,466
The Black Spot. At 10 o'clock.

171
00:19:48,385 --> 00:19:51,874
At 10 o'clock they'll come for my trunk.

172
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:58,725
That's 4 more hours.
That's all right! I'll show them!

173

He's hazed me long enough!

346
00:43:36,231 --> 00:43:39,153
I want to live in his cabin and...

347
00:43:39,253 --> 00:43:40,252
- Hands...

348
00:43:41,217 --> 00:43:47,115
Your head has no price on it because it
never had any brains. Do not rush things.

349
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:51,099
- But Silver, I...
- Quiet. I'm talking.

350
00:43:52,988 --> 00:43:58,685
After Squire and Doctor find the treasure
and help us load it on the ship...

351
00:43:58,785 --> 00:44:01,532
- What are we going to do with them?

352
00:44:01,678 --> 00:44:05,514
- England would have left them
on some deserted island.

353
00:44:05,892 --> 00:44:11,618
Flint or Billy Bones would have
cut them down like that much pork.

354
00:44:12,286 --> 00:44:14,990
- Dead men don't bite!

355
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:20,076
- I vote... to kill.

356
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:22,953
- Land ho!

357
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:37,049
- This is our last chance!

358
00:44:37,916 --> 00:44:40,765
It's not a payment in advance,

359
00:44:40,865 --> 00:44:43,543
It always happens only once.

360
00:44:43,643 --> 00:44:46,215
When fortune throws a furtive glance

361
00:44:46,315 --> 00:44:48,647
That's your chance!

362
00:44:49,759 --> 00:44:52,084
You may come close but no cigar.

363
00:44:52,184 --> 00:44:54,861
And if you miss it, then you are

364
00:44:54,962 --> 00:44:57,847
better of wishing on a star!

365
00:44:57,947 --> 00:44:58,948
They are

366
00:44:59,048 --> 00:45:02,083
sending the black spot,
sending the black spot

367
00:45:02,183 --> 00:45:03,185
to me!

368
00:45:05,904 --> 00:45:09,409
I got the black spot,
I got the damned spot!

369
00:45:09,509 --> 00:45:10,973
Flee!

370
00:45:11,944 --> 00:45:14,584
And when it is within your reach,

371
00:45:14,684 --> 00:45:17,189
When you're almost filthy rich,

372
00:45:17,289 --> 00:45:20,210
Somebody throws a hidden switch!

373
00:45:20,348 --> 00:45:21,805
Rotten luck!

374
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,959
It helped you pick your sailing crew,

375
00:45:34,059 --> 00:45:36,875
It fought and boarded ships with you!

376
00:45:36,975 --> 00:45:41,737
It was behind you when you drew
your muskets.

377
00:45:43,092 --> 00:45:45,555
But once you make your first mistake

378
00:45:45,655 --> 00:45:48,265
You'll be a mouse before a snake,

379
00:45:48,365 --> 00:45:51,042
And snakes don't give much of a break.

380
00:45:51,142 --> 00:45:52,140
They are

381
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,452
Sending the black spot,
Sending the black spot

382
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:56,552
to me!

383
00:45:58,993 --> 00:46:02,535
I got the black spot,
I got the damned spot!

384
00:46:02,847 --> 00:46:03,855
Flee!

385
00:46:05,209 --> 00:46:07,882
And when it is within your reach,

386
00:46:07,982 --> 00:46:10,626
When you're almost filthy rich,

387
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:13,854
Somebody throws a hidden switch!

388
00:46:13,993 --> 00:46:15,938
Rotten luck!

389
00:46:24,654 --> 00:46:27,291
It made you rubber, not the glue

390
00:46:27,391 --> 00:46:29,757
It stuffed your wallet thick for you

391
00:46:29,857 --> 00:46:35,382
It was behind you when you drew
your muskets.

392
00:46:36,041 --> 00:46:38,751
And when it is within your reach,

393
00:46:38,851 --> 00:46:41,771
When you're almost filthy rich,

394
00:46:41,869 --> 00:46:44,688
Somebody throws a hidden switch!
