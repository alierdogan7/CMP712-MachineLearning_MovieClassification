1
00:00:01,388 --> 00:00:02,856
<i>So here's what
you missed on Glee:</i>

2
00:00:02,907 --> 00:00:03,773
<i>Prom's coming up, and Quinn's
desperate to win queen</i>

3
00:00:03,858 --> 00:00:05,158
<i>so she can hold on to Finn,</i>

4
00:00:05,226 --> 00:00:06,760
<i>who still sort of
has eyes for Rachel.</i>

5
00:00:06,827 --> 00:00:08,528
<i>But Zizes also wants to be
queen, and Puck's up for king,</i>

6
00:00:08,579 --> 00:00:10,447
<i>and Karofsky and Santana
want to win, too,</i>

7
00:00:10,531 --> 00:00:11,831
<i>'cause they both got
a secret they'd like to keep.</i>

8
00:00:11,899 --> 00:00:13,283
Have you ever heard
of the term "beards"?

9
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:14,951
<i>Artie and Brittany
were BF and GF,</i>

10
00:00:15,036 --> 00:00:16,419
<i>but he got mad
and said she was stupid,</i>

11
00:00:16,504 --> 00:00:17,587
<i>and now they're not
BF and GF.</i>

12
00:00:17,672 --> 00:00:18,455
You were the only person
at this school

13
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:19,789
that never called me that.

14
00:00:19,874 --> 00:00:21,341
<i>Can you believe that?</i>

15
00:00:21,408 --> 00:00:23,043
<i>And that's what you missed
on Glee.</i>

16
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:27,580
(bell ringing)
Hi, everyone.
It's junior prom minus six days

17
00:00:27,632 --> 00:00:29,599
here at McKinley,
and today I'm joined

18
00:00:29,684 --> 00:00:32,519
by Junior Prom King candidate,
Noah Puckerman.

19
00:00:32,586 --> 00:00:35,254
I prefer Puck.
So, Noah, can
I get a comment

20
00:00:35,306 --> 00:00:38,257
on the recent poll number that
put the Fabray/Hudson ticket

21
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:40,426
ten points above
you and Zizes--

22
00:00:40,478 --> 00:00:43,396
AKA the "Road Warriors."
We're still ahead of
Santana and Karofsky

23
00:00:43,447 --> 00:00:45,482
by half a point, so
our campaign strategy

24
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:47,651
is to close the gap
using a combination

25
00:00:47,735 --> 00:00:49,235
of intimidation
and fear.

26
00:00:49,287 --> 00:00:50,820
Awesome and classy.

27
00:00:50,905 --> 00:00:53,490
One more question-- this one
was e-mailed in by a fan.

28
00:00:53,574 --> 00:00:55,775
"Where does Lauren
keep your balls?"

29
00:00:56,911 --> 00:00:58,277
What?

30
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:00,113
I'm sure you've heard
the word on the street

31
00:01:00,164 --> 00:01:02,215
that you've been
neutered by Ms. Zizes.

32
00:01:02,282 --> 00:01:04,450
That she's the one who wears
the pants in the relationship.

33
00:01:04,502 --> 00:01:06,119
Shut up or I'll beat your ass.

34
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,588
(trembling): I'm not scared--
I've been hit by a girl before.

35
00:01:08,639 --> 00:01:10,807
This is JBI
signing off.

36
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:12,676
Tune in tomorrow when
we'll be interviewing

37
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,511
frontrunner Quinn Fabray.

38
00:01:14,595 --> 00:01:15,845
Hubba hubba.

39
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,314

Synced By YesCool

41
00:01:21,261 --> 00:01:22,902
I have some bad news.

42
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,187
Will Schuester
is leaving McKinley

43
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:25,488
to go to Broadway.

44
00:01:25,573 --> 00:01:27,140
Oh, William,
I'm devasted--

45
00:01:27,191 --> 00:01:28,858
positively horny
with grief.

46
00:01:28,943 --> 00:01:30,994
As a going-away present,
here's a spray bottle

47
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:32,979
of I Can't Believe
It's Not Butter

48
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,248
to keep that head-merken
looking buttery fresh.

49
00:01:35,315 --> 00:01:37,751
No, no. Junior prom
is in one week

50
00:01:37,818 --> 00:01:39,419
and my favorite
band cancelled.

51
00:01:39,486 --> 00:01:41,254
What band?
Air Supply, William.

52
00:01:41,322 --> 00:01:43,823
So I'm inviting
my next favorite group:

53
00:01:43,874 --> 00:01:44,958
The New Directions.

54
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:47,043
Nope. No way.
Um...

55
00:01:47,128 --> 00:01:49,162
I agree. I mean,
normally we would jump

56
00:01:49,213 --> 00:01:50,430
at the chance to
perform, but...

57
00:01:50,497 --> 00:01:51,948
I mean, we've got Nationals
in three weeks,

58
00:01:52,016 --> 00:01:53,717
which means that we have
a lot of rehearsals

59
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:56,386
and a lot of taffy to sell,
just so we can afford the trip.

60
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,389
William, this glass is half-full
of dreams for all of us.

61
00:01:59,473 --> 00:02:01,441
I have decided
to give all the money

62
00:02:01,508 --> 00:02:04,060
to the Glee Club that I was
going to pay Air Supply!

63
00:02:04,145 --> 00:02:06,312
So that's $400
right there for you.

64
00:02:06,364 --> 00:02:09,866
I won't allow it--
I'm prom coordinator,
and I was not consulted.

65
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:14,120
Each year I honor the prom
with a bowl of my family's
secret punch recipe,

66
00:02:14,188 --> 00:02:16,623
made all the more meaningful
to me because it's

67
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,357
the punch bowl my
grandmother drowned in.

68
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:21,711
And, each year, that
punch bowl is spiked.

69
00:02:21,796 --> 00:02:23,430
Such lawlessness will
only be encouraged

70
00:02:23,497 --> 00:02:26,299
when being screeched at
by that Glee Club!

71
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:27,834
Sue, it is not
a discussion!

72
00:02:27,885 --> 00:02:29,252
We are in the lurch!

73
00:02:29,336 --> 00:02:32,555
Fine. Well, then let me
take this opportunity

74
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,890
to make a request.

75
00:02:33,974 --> 00:02:37,043
William, I have in my
Spanks, at all times,

76
00:02:37,094 --> 00:02:38,645
<i>a list of the
worst songs</i>

77
00:02:38,712 --> 00:02:40,313
ever performed
by the Glee Club.

78
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,515
And I would appreciate it
if you would not reprise

79
00:02:42,566 --> 00:02:43,933
any of the
following numbers.

80
00:02:44,018 --> 00:02:44,934
Number one,

81
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:46,352
"Run, Joey, Run."

82
00:02:46,404 --> 00:02:48,221
You should literally
apologize to America

83
00:02:48,272 --> 00:02:49,823
for that one.
Number two,

84
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,057
The ingenius mash-up

85
00:02:51,108 --> 00:02:53,193
of "Crazy in Love"
and "Hair."

86
00:02:53,244 --> 00:02:54,494
Now, I know you
must have been

87
00:02:54,561 --> 00:02:56,496
pretty tired when you
put that baby together.

88
00:02:56,563 --> 00:02:58,865
If you'll excuse me.

89
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,784
We'll see you
at the prom, butt chin.

90
00:03:01,952 --> 00:03:03,253
(bell ringing)

91
00:03:03,337 --> 00:03:04,754
I've been to Ann Taylor Loft,

92
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:06,289
Filene's Basement
and, like, six Forever 21s,

93
00:03:06,373 --> 00:03:08,074
and I cannot find
a dress that fits.

94
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,743
I'm gonna be forced
to make my own dress for prom.

95
00:03:10,795 --> 00:03:11,911
BRITANNY: Don't.
You'll seem poor.
SANTANA:
You're up for queen.

96
00:03:11,962 --> 00:03:13,346
You can't make
your own prom dress.

97
00:03:13,413 --> 00:03:14,580
Prom is, like, our Oscars.

98
00:03:14,632 --> 00:03:15,799
It's seriously, like,

99
00:03:15,883 --> 00:03:17,350
the most important
night of our lives.

100
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:18,718
What about
getting married?

101
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:20,637
Oh, you can get married
as many times as you want.

102
00:03:20,721 --> 00:03:22,472
You only have one shot
at your junior prom.

103
00:03:22,556 --> 00:03:25,225
What are you guys
talking about?
Prom dresses.

104
00:03:25,276 --> 00:03:27,527
Thank God I don't have
to worry about that.
I'm not going.

105
00:03:27,594 --> 00:03:30,429
Why not?
'Cause nobody's asked me.

106
00:03:30,481 --> 00:03:31,531
All right, guys-- prom.

107
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:32,615
Please tell me we're not

108
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,867
doing songs about prom.

109
00:03:33,934 --> 00:03:35,568
<i>Nope. We are the prom.</i>

110
00:03:35,619 --> 00:03:37,153
Figgins has asked
us to perform.

111
00:03:37,238 --> 00:03:38,371
Let's do
"Run, Joey, Run."

112
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:40,690
Now, I know this
isn't ideal with

113
00:03:40,758 --> 00:03:41,791
Nationals coming up,
but we really don't

114
00:03:41,876 --> 00:03:42,992
have a choice.

115
00:03:43,077 --> 00:03:44,811
And we could
really use the money.

116
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,280
But I know that prom is a
special rite of passage.

117
00:03:47,331 --> 00:03:48,665
I'm gonna make sure
that all of you guys

118
00:03:48,749 --> 00:03:50,100
get a chance to enjoy
the dance, too.

119
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:51,301
So, we're gonna stagger

120
00:03:51,385 --> 00:03:52,451
the performances

121
00:03:52,503 --> 00:03:54,254
so that each and
every one of you

122
00:03:54,305 --> 00:03:56,956
has a lot of time to
dance with your dates.

123
00:03:57,007 --> 00:03:58,675
Excuse me.

124
00:04:02,296 --> 00:04:04,447
Is she okay?
Mercedes doesn't have
a date for prom.

125
00:04:04,515 --> 00:04:06,299
So? I don't have a date.

126
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,401
I'm just going to dance, and
then all your dates are

127
00:04:08,468 --> 00:04:10,153
gonna ignore you and come
dance with me, so...

128
00:04:10,237 --> 00:04:11,688
your dates are really my dates.

129
00:04:11,772 --> 00:04:12,939
KURT:
I'm gonna go talk

130
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,691
to Mercedes.
No. Let me.

131
00:04:17,144 --> 00:04:18,661
Hey.

132
00:04:20,614 --> 00:04:22,832
You know, I don't have
a date to prom, either.

133
00:04:22,917 --> 00:04:24,868
You know, I know that
I talk a good game

134
00:04:24,952 --> 00:04:26,619
about not needing
a man, and I don't.

135
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,289
I just really wanted to
take a date to the prom.

136
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,208
I want the dress...

137
00:04:32,276 --> 00:04:34,660
and the guy...

138
00:04:34,712 --> 00:04:36,763
and the damn corsage.

139
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,933
Somebody... somebody
still may ask you.

140
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,602
It's this Saturday.
You know...

141
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:45,855
I just wanted to
be Cinderella...

142
00:04:45,923 --> 00:04:48,608
just for one night.

143
00:04:48,675 --> 00:04:50,777
One night where
a guy would...

144
00:04:50,844 --> 00:04:54,147
would look at me under those
corny crepe paper streamers

145
00:04:54,198 --> 00:04:57,167
and say... "You
look so beautiful."

146
00:04:57,234 --> 00:04:59,619
And then he'd...

147
00:04:59,686 --> 00:05:01,871
grab my hand and
ask me to dance.

148
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:05,942
Isn't that what prom
is supposed to be about?

149
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,678
You're not gonna go
to prom alone.

150
00:05:08,746 --> 00:05:11,080
You'll go with me.
That's even more
depressing.

151
00:05:11,165 --> 00:05:13,666
I have a plan.

152
00:05:15,252 --> 00:05:16,819
Give me your hand.

153
00:05:18,372 --> 00:05:19,722
Blaine Warbler...

154
00:05:19,807 --> 00:05:22,408
will you go
to junior prom with me?

155
00:05:22,476 --> 00:05:24,227
Prom?

156
00:05:24,295 --> 00:05:26,446
It'll be the social event
of the season.

157
00:05:26,513 --> 00:05:28,648
You don't want
to go to prom with me?
No, no,

158
00:05:28,715 --> 00:05:30,549
of course, of course
I want to go with you.

159
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:32,819
It's just...

160
00:05:32,886 --> 00:05:34,237
(sighs)
Prom.

161
00:05:34,321 --> 00:05:36,322
What about prom, Blaine?

162
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,759
At my old school
there was a Sadie Hawkins Dance,

163
00:05:39,827 --> 00:05:43,146
<i>and... I had just come out,</i>

164
00:05:43,214 --> 00:05:45,582
so I asked a
friend of mine,

165
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,401
the only other gay
guy in the school,

166
00:05:48,452 --> 00:05:53,039
and while we were waiting
for his dad to pick us up...

167
00:05:53,107 --> 00:05:55,325
these three guys...

168
00:05:55,392 --> 00:05:57,243
um...

169
00:05:58,712 --> 00:06:01,247
...beat the living crap
out of us.

170
00:06:01,315 --> 00:06:03,016
I...

171
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,851
I'm so sorry.

172
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:06,352
I'm-I'm out and I'm proud

173
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,021
and all that--
this is just

174
00:06:08,088 --> 00:06:09,489
a little bit of a sore spot.

175
00:06:09,556 --> 00:06:10,923
This is perfect.

176
00:06:10,975 --> 00:06:13,443
You couldn't face up
to the bullies at your school,

177
00:06:13,527 --> 00:06:15,311
so you can do it at mine.

178
00:06:15,396 --> 00:06:17,130
We could do it
together.

179
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:20,566
But I have to say, Blaine,

180
00:06:20,618 --> 00:06:23,286
that if it makes you feel
uncomfortable at all,

181
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,105
then we'll just
forget about prom.

182
00:06:26,156 --> 00:06:28,157
We'll go to a movie instead.

183
00:06:29,693 --> 00:06:31,461
I am crazy about you.

184
00:06:31,545 --> 00:06:34,697
So I'll take that as a yes?

185
00:06:36,216 --> 00:06:37,583
Yes.

186
00:06:37,635 --> 00:06:39,636
Yes, you and I are
going to the prom.

187
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,953
Mm, mm!

188
00:06:41,005 --> 00:06:42,972
Is this a surprise
party or something?

189
00:06:43,057 --> 00:06:44,790
Because my birthday
was last week.

190
00:06:44,842 --> 00:06:46,125
It-it was?

191
00:06:46,176 --> 00:06:47,960
Um, no.

192
00:06:48,012 --> 00:06:49,812
Mercedes and I, we have
a proposition for you.

193
00:06:49,897 --> 00:06:52,415
We were wondering
if you'd like to go

194
00:06:52,483 --> 00:06:54,300
to prom with us.
Kind of like a...

195
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:56,703
a three-way date, but
not the dirty kind.

196
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,771
(chuckles): That sounds great,
but I can't afford to take

197
00:06:58,822 --> 00:07:00,907
one girl to the prom; I don't
know how I'm gonna take two.

198
00:07:02,326 --> 00:07:03,693
What's this?
Our prom budget.

199
00:07:03,777 --> 00:07:05,278
You're gonna have to borrow
a suit from your dad,

200
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:06,663
and we're gonna buy
five-dollar dresses

201
00:07:06,747 --> 00:07:08,498
down at the Goodwill,
and make our own corsages

202
00:07:08,582 --> 00:07:10,033
out of flowers from
my mom's garden.

203
00:07:10,117 --> 00:07:12,151
And we can walk to prom
and then use what's left

204
00:07:12,202 --> 00:07:13,953
to get the $8.99
all-you-can-eat

205
00:07:14,004 --> 00:07:15,988
pasta special at Breadstix.

206
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,258
But, you know, the $20, it's
not charity, it's a loan.

207
00:07:20,544 --> 00:07:22,912
So... you'll go with us?

208
00:07:25,432 --> 00:07:27,333
It would be an honor.

209
00:07:27,384 --> 00:07:28,551
Yes!

210
00:07:28,635 --> 00:07:29,352
(all laughing)

211
00:07:34,715 --> 00:07:37,267
Ladies, I appreciate
you welcoming me

212
00:07:37,351 --> 00:07:41,238
into the sacred inner sanctum
that is the prom gown dry run.

213
00:07:41,322 --> 00:07:42,572
Why did we decide
to include Kurt?

214
00:07:42,657 --> 00:07:44,224
Because getting
a look past him is like

215
00:07:44,275 --> 00:07:45,942
getting a thumbs up
from Joan and Melissa Rivers.

216
00:07:46,027 --> 00:07:48,445
It just might goose
our pre-prom buzz factor.

217
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,234
I look like

218
00:07:54,285 --> 00:07:55,635
a lemon meringue pie.

219
00:07:56,704 --> 00:07:57,971
I think you look delicious.

220
00:07:58,039 --> 00:07:59,206
Don't despair.

221
00:07:59,257 --> 00:08:00,907
Nobody bigger
than a size two

222
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,043
looks good in a prom dress.
I mean, they're practically

223
00:08:03,094 --> 00:08:04,294
designed to make us
look awkward.

224
00:08:04,362 --> 00:08:05,495
I think

225
00:08:05,563 --> 00:08:07,931
the color is wrong.

226
00:08:08,015 --> 00:08:09,799
KURT:
Let's go navy, hm?

227
00:08:09,884 --> 00:08:11,268
<i>It's chic and slimming.</i>

228
00:08:11,352 --> 00:08:12,969
Duly noted.

229
00:08:13,054 --> 00:08:14,137
KURT: Agree? Agree?
Oh, my God.

230
00:08:14,222 --> 00:08:15,355
It's brilliant.

231
00:08:15,422 --> 00:08:16,422
Absolutely.
Next.

232
00:08:16,474 --> 00:08:18,024
(Kurt gasps)

233
00:08:18,092 --> 00:08:20,110
I knew it. Fashion.

234
00:08:20,194 --> 00:08:21,728
Devil in a red dress.

235
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:24,197
Perfect, and it's
totally appropriate
for your personality.

236
00:08:24,265 --> 00:08:25,431
I have no criticisms.

237
00:08:25,483 --> 00:08:26,816
Go with God, Satan. Santana.

238
00:08:28,369 --> 00:08:29,536
Now, if you ladies'll excuse me,

239
00:08:29,603 --> 00:08:31,738
I have to pull options
for my own prom outfit.

240
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:33,873
Wait, so you're
going? Stag?

241
00:08:33,941 --> 00:08:35,325
That's just tragic.

242
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:38,211
Yes, I'm going, and not alone.

243
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,713
With Blaine.

244
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,947
(gasping, squealing)

245
00:08:40,998 --> 00:08:42,382
Congratulations!
That's amazing!

246
00:08:42,449 --> 00:08:43,833
Ladies, if
you'll excuse me,

247
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:46,002
I have a private fashion
question for Kurt.
Okay.

248
00:08:46,087 --> 00:08:48,138
So, Kurt,

249
00:08:48,222 --> 00:08:50,957
I think that you need
a full security detail,
which the Bully Whips

250
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:53,593
and I would be more than
happy to provide you with.

251
00:08:53,644 --> 00:08:55,478
You know, like the
Hell's Angels when
the Rolling Stones

252
00:08:55,546 --> 00:08:57,397
the Rolling Stones
performed at
Altamont Speedway.

253
00:08:57,464 --> 00:08:59,232
I think that went off
without a hitch.

254
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,134
And why would you do that?

255
00:09:01,185 --> 00:09:02,936
Because I'll get sympathy
votes for prom queen.

256
00:09:02,987 --> 00:09:05,572
I'll be, like,
the law-and-order
Eva Peron candidate.

257
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:06,856
Grimace and Stretch Marks

258
00:09:06,924 --> 00:09:08,174
won't stand a chance.

259
00:09:08,242 --> 00:09:10,443
(bell rings)

260
00:09:12,697 --> 00:09:14,998
PUCK: So, since you
don't have a date

261
00:09:15,082 --> 00:09:16,816
to the prom now,
I was hoping you could

262
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:18,418
help me out with
Operation Punch and Judy.

263
00:09:18,485 --> 00:09:19,669
Every year
at McKinley,

264
00:09:19,754 --> 00:09:21,738
they crown a king and
queen at the prom,

265
00:09:21,806 --> 00:09:23,573
but there's
a shadow world--
a dark community

266
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:25,959
of trouble makers that
crown the prom anti-king.

267
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,795
And you're planning
on that being you?

268
00:09:28,846 --> 00:09:30,347
My street cred's in the gutter.

269
00:09:30,431 --> 00:09:32,498
If I actually win
Prom King with Lauren,
I'll never be able

270
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,850
to rebuild my reputation

271
00:09:33,934 --> 00:09:35,668
as a lovable but
dangerous miscreant.

272
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,437
I have to spike Coach
Sylvester's punch.

273
00:09:37,504 --> 00:09:39,472
What does this
have to do with me?

274
00:09:39,523 --> 00:09:41,474
I'm prime suspect number one.

275
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:44,227
Coach Sylvester won't let me
within ten feet of that bowl.

276
00:09:44,312 --> 00:09:45,812
<i>When she grabs me,</i>

277
00:09:45,863 --> 00:09:48,365
<i>I'll create a diversion
with my sweet dance moves.</i>

278
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:50,734
<i>She'll be mesmerized,
hypnotized by my love dance.</i>

279
00:09:50,818 --> 00:09:52,819
<i>That's when you'll
sneak in behind us</i>

280
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,738
<i>and pour a bottle of gin
in the bowl.</i>

281
00:09:54,822 --> 00:09:56,072
Awesome, right?

282
00:09:56,157 --> 00:09:57,540
So are you in?

283
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:00,076
As my ass-istant bad-ass?
Look,

284
00:10:00,161 --> 00:10:01,578
I'm... I'm sorry.

285
00:10:01,662 --> 00:10:03,046
While I admire

286
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,715
your bad-boy villainy
and, yes, long for the day

287
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,467
when I am similarly cool,

288
00:10:07,534 --> 00:10:09,669
I just, I don't think
spiking the prom hooch

289
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,721
will impress
Brittany enough.

290
00:10:11,806 --> 00:10:13,890
There's got to be
a surefire way

291
00:10:13,974 --> 00:10:16,876
for her to both forgive me
and accept my prom proposal.

292
00:10:16,927 --> 00:10:19,879
(bell ringing)
There's got to be.

293
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,849
Oh, members of the Audio-Visual
Club, I may possibly

294
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,317
sing this song
at prom,

295
00:10:24,385 --> 00:10:26,853
and when I'm done rehearsing,
I'd like your feedback.

296
00:10:26,904 --> 00:10:29,689

or simply outstanding.

00:12:44,658 --> 00:12:45,692
(sighs)

346
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,077
It's good to see you
again, Rachel.

347
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:53,516
Jessie... what are
you doing here?

348
00:12:53,584 --> 00:12:54,751
I mean, how was
I supposed to know

349
00:12:54,819 --> 00:12:55,985
that I was actually
supposed to show up

350
00:12:56,053 --> 00:12:57,353
to those other classes
at school?

351
00:12:57,421 --> 00:12:59,489
I was majoring
in show choir.

352
00:12:59,557 --> 00:13:01,374
I just assumed
it would be like at Carmel

353
00:13:01,442 --> 00:13:03,009
and the school would get
some Asian kid

354
00:13:03,077 --> 00:13:05,261
to take math and English
and scientific for me.

355
00:13:05,346 --> 00:13:07,313
That's awful.

356
00:13:07,381 --> 00:13:09,265
I came back
to see you, Rachel.

357
00:13:12,603 --> 00:13:17,323
What I did to you...
that's my one great regret.

358
00:13:17,391 --> 00:13:21,194
Yeah, it was kind of weird.

359
00:13:21,262 --> 00:13:23,246
One day you were telling
me that you loved me

360
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,747
and then you were
inexplicably throwing eggs

361
00:13:24,832 --> 00:13:25,865
at my head the next.

362
00:13:25,933 --> 00:13:29,002
I know, I know.

363
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:30,236
I traded love

364
00:13:30,287 --> 00:13:33,990
for a fourth consecutive
national championship.

365
00:13:34,058 --> 00:13:36,125
It was a bum deal.

366
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,344
For a first, maybe,
but for a fourth, no way.

367
00:13:38,412 --> 00:13:41,347
I've come
to make amends.

368
00:13:45,469 --> 00:13:47,270
So what are you doing
for prom?

369
00:13:53,294 --> 00:13:55,879
So I heard a nasty rumor
that Jessie St. James
is back in town

370
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,381
and I also heard that he
is going to be your date.

371
00:13:58,432 --> 00:13:59,749
No, he's joining

372
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,185
Mercedes and Sam and I
on our prom on a budget.

373
00:14:02,252 --> 00:14:04,253
He's going to be in town
for a while, though,

374
00:14:04,305 --> 00:14:05,722
so I'm not sure what's
going to come of it.

375
00:14:05,773 --> 00:14:07,107
I just--
I don't trust him.

376
00:14:07,191 --> 00:14:08,892
Don't you remember what he did
to you, how awful he was?

377
00:14:08,943 --> 00:14:11,111
You can't tell me
what to do anymore, okay?

378
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:13,146
If I want to date Jessie,
or anyone for that matter,

379
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,565
it stopped being your business
when you broke up with me.

380
00:14:15,616 --> 00:14:16,816
I-I still care about you.

381
00:14:19,704 --> 00:14:22,438
Look, all I ask is
that whoever I choose,

382
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,940
that you be
as supportive of me

383
00:14:23,991 --> 00:14:25,742
as I have been of you
and Quinn, even though

384
00:14:25,793 --> 00:14:27,794
I'm dying every day
inside about it.

385
00:14:30,881 --> 00:14:33,500
You know, I don't even want to
go to the stupid prom anymore.

386
00:14:33,584 --> 00:14:34,968
Quinn has got
me handing out

387
00:14:35,052 --> 00:14:36,285
pens with our names on them.

388
00:14:36,337 --> 00:14:37,670
Where's the dignity?

389
00:14:37,755 --> 00:14:40,640
And I hate renting those
tuxes, and the corsage--

390
00:14:40,725 --> 00:14:42,008
I know I'm going to
pick the wrong one

391
00:14:42,093 --> 00:14:43,643
and then Quinn's going
to be all pissed off

392
00:14:43,728 --> 00:14:47,147
and her mom's going
to look at me like...
Hey, just...

393
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:48,598
just get her
something simple--

394
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:50,683
a wrist corsage.

395
00:14:50,768 --> 00:14:52,102
Girls like Quinn--
you don't want to do anything

396
00:14:52,153 --> 00:14:53,469
that's going to distract
from their face,

397
00:14:53,521 --> 00:14:55,321
so ask for a gardenia

398
00:14:55,406 --> 00:14:57,574
with a,
with a light green ribbon

399
00:14:57,641 --> 00:14:58,708
wrapped around it
to match her eyes.

400
00:15:00,394 --> 00:15:02,278
Okay?

401
00:15:08,169 --> 00:15:11,037
(bell ringing)

402
00:15:11,122 --> 00:15:12,589
Everything looks good.

403
00:15:12,656 --> 00:15:17,210
No gay protests or rainbow flags
being lit on fire down this way.

404
00:15:17,294 --> 00:15:18,845
SANTANA:
Are you finished talking?

405
00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:20,329
Yeah.

406
00:15:20,381 --> 00:15:21,548
When you're finished talking,
you should say "over."

407
00:15:21,632 --> 00:15:22,549
Sorry.

408
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:24,300
No burning Liberace mannequins.

409
00:15:24,351 --> 00:15:25,351
Over.

410
00:15:25,436 --> 00:15:28,171
All right, lady
lips, all clear.

411
00:15:28,222 --> 00:15:31,274
Teen gay, you may now proceed
to the next checkpoint

412
00:15:31,341 --> 00:15:33,726
without fear
of violence.

413
00:15:33,811 --> 00:15:35,862
Why are you speaking
so loud?

414
00:15:35,946 --> 00:15:37,897
I'm the law-and-order
prom queen candidate,

415
00:15:37,982 --> 00:15:40,016
here to protect
every student at this school

416
00:15:40,067 --> 00:15:41,184
from harassment.

417
00:15:41,235 --> 00:15:42,368
Did she...?

418
00:15:42,453 --> 00:15:44,020
I'm, I'm walking
away from you now.

419
00:15:44,071 --> 00:15:46,372
(bell ringing)

420
00:15:46,457 --> 00:15:49,459
Just crack the egg.

421
00:15:49,526 --> 00:15:51,527
I just don't understand
the difference between an egg

422
00:15:51,579 --> 00:15:53,963
with a baby chicken inside of it
and an egg with an egg in it.

423
00:15:54,031 --> 00:15:55,165
They're the same thing.

424
00:15:55,232 --> 00:15:56,916
Okay, that's really confusing

425
00:15:57,001 --> 00:15:58,918
because this is
a baby chicken's house.

426
00:15:59,003 --> 00:16:00,220
Mrs. Hagberg,
I understand that cupcakes

427
00:16:00,304 --> 00:16:01,671
are really trendy right now,

428
00:16:01,722 --> 00:16:03,356
and I know the making
of a foie gras

429
00:16:03,424 --> 00:16:04,724
might be
a little morose,

430
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:06,893
but, um, I would like to
at least graduate high school

431
00:16:06,977 --> 00:16:08,478
knowing how to make
some kind of pÃ¢té.

432
00:16:08,545 --> 00:16:10,930
Excuse me, Mrs. Hagberg,
I need to say something.

433
00:16:12,099 --> 00:16:14,434
(sighs)

434
00:16:14,518 --> 00:16:15,568
Brittany, I was a jerk

435
00:16:15,653 --> 00:16:17,020
to you.

436
00:16:17,071 --> 00:16:19,105
Mm-hmm.
And I want to make it up
to you with a song

437
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,391
so maybe you'll consider going
to prom with me.

438
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:24,110

So?

464
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,514
Artie, that was lovely,

465
00:17:51,565 --> 00:17:53,766
but I'm not going to
go to prom with you.

466
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:55,718
You called me stupid, and
I really didn't like that,

467
00:17:55,769 --> 00:18:00,323
so I'm sorry, but I'm
gonna go to prom by myself

468
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,858
and really work on me

469
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:03,243
and dance with other
people's dates.

470
00:18:06,497 --> 00:18:08,498
I understand.

471
00:18:08,565 --> 00:18:11,751
I, I hope you know
how sorry I am.

472
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,171
Yeah.

473
00:18:20,511 --> 00:18:21,961
Dude...

474
00:18:22,046 --> 00:18:24,580
sorry for the timing,
but I'd really like to revisit

475
00:18:24,632 --> 00:18:26,582
the possibility of you helping
me spike the punch bowl.

476
00:18:26,634 --> 00:18:29,418
I'm in.

477
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,420
I have nothing to live for.

478
00:18:36,143 --> 00:18:39,028
So you think it's cool if
I jam with you guys at prom?

479
00:18:39,096 --> 00:18:40,863
Yeah, totally.

480
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:42,598
Good news, boys.

481
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,234
My buddy Enzo
from the tux rental shop

482
00:18:45,286 --> 00:18:46,369
is giving you half off.

483
00:18:46,436 --> 00:18:47,704
Sweet.

484
00:18:47,771 --> 00:18:49,405
Yeah, so what are
you going to go with?

485
00:18:49,456 --> 00:18:50,373
I'm going simple--

486
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,774
black,

487
00:18:51,825 --> 00:18:53,543
thin lapel collar--
very discreet.

488
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,877
Know what I wore to my prom?

489
00:18:54,945 --> 00:18:56,779
I wore a powder blue tux
with a ruffled shirt

490
00:18:56,847 --> 00:18:59,115
and a big velour bowtie.

491
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,550
Looked like Tony Orlando.

492
00:19:00,617 --> 00:19:02,585
Was that a designer?

493
00:19:02,636 --> 00:19:03,970
No.

494
00:19:04,054 --> 00:19:05,221
KURT:
No need for half
off my outfit.

495
00:19:05,288 --> 00:19:08,290
Because half of it
is already off?

496
00:19:08,342 --> 00:19:10,476
My ensemble is an homage
to the recent royal wedding

497
00:19:10,561 --> 00:19:11,728
and the late
Alexander McQueen.

498
00:19:11,795 --> 00:19:13,146
I had to make
it myself.

499
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,064
There's simply nothing
off the rack that is suitable

500
00:19:15,132 --> 00:19:16,649
for the young fashionable man
in Ohio.

501
00:19:16,734 --> 00:19:20,353
Dude, that rocks.
It's like gay Braveheart.

502
00:19:20,437 --> 00:19:22,271
I don't like it.

503
00:19:22,323 --> 00:19:23,239
Well, of course
you don't like it.

504
00:19:23,306 --> 00:19:24,657
It's not finished yet.

505
00:19:24,742 --> 00:19:26,809
I think it still needs, like,
a sash or maybe some beads.

506
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,161
Look, I'm not going
to stop you

507
00:19:28,245 --> 00:19:31,080
from wearing it,
but I got to be honest-- I...

508
00:19:31,148 --> 00:19:32,532
I think you're
just trying to stir

509
00:19:32,616 --> 00:19:33,866
the pot a little bit.

510
00:19:33,951 --> 00:19:35,251
I think you're trying
to get some attention.

511
00:19:35,318 --> 00:19:36,202
Exactly.

512
00:19:36,286 --> 00:19:37,503
What's the point of dressing up?

513
00:19:37,588 --> 00:19:38,588
I mean, that's why
some guys wear

514
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:39,706
the tails
with the top hat

515
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,090
and, and the girls wear
the hoop skirts.

516
00:19:41,158 --> 00:19:42,258
I mean, Blaine,
help me out here.

517
00:19:42,325 --> 00:19:43,659
I think your dad
has a point.

518
00:19:45,162 --> 00:19:46,929
I-I think what
he's trying to say

519
00:19:46,997 --> 00:19:48,214
is that we
just don't want

520
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:50,933
to give anyone a reason
to cause any trouble.

521
00:19:51,001 --> 00:19:51,851
There's a lot of bad people
out there, Kurt,

522
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,852
and they're a lot worse

523
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,303
than this Karofsky kid,

524
00:19:54,355 --> 00:19:56,356
and all they're
looking for is a match

525
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,357
to light
under the fire

526
00:19:57,441 --> 00:19:58,775
of their hate.

527
00:19:58,842 --> 00:20:00,676
Now, of course I,

528
00:20:00,728 --> 00:20:04,013
I want, I want you
to be yourself,

529
00:20:04,064 --> 00:20:07,166
but I also-- I want you
to be practical.

530
00:20:10,704 --> 00:20:13,005
I have done everything right.

531
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,625
Now, Blaine,
I understand

532
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:18,711
that after what you've been
through, you're worried,

533
00:20:18,796 --> 00:20:21,781
but prom is about joy,
not about fear.

534
00:20:21,849 --> 00:20:23,883
So I am wearing this suit.

535
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:25,418
I worked
hard on it

536
00:20:25,502 --> 00:20:27,036
and I think it's fantastic,

537
00:20:27,087 --> 00:20:30,223
and if you don't want to join
me, I completely understand.

538
00:20:38,941 --> 00:20:41,576
Here we are, third period,
French class.

539
00:20:41,643 --> 00:20:43,477
I'm going to calculus,
so wait inside the classroom

540
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:44,695
after the bell rings

541
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,480
until I get back to
walk you to lunch.

542
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:51,152
Have you noticed that no one
has said boo to me this week?

543
00:20:51,203 --> 00:20:52,203
That's 'cause the Bullywhips
are protecting you.

544
00:20:52,287 --> 00:20:53,487
Maybe.

545
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:55,590
But maybe no one has been
harassing me this week

546
00:20:55,657 --> 00:20:56,874
because nobody cares.

547
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,676
You're dreaming.
Okay, look,

548
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,661
I'm not saying
that everyone in this school

549
00:21:00,712 --> 00:21:02,296
is ready
to embrace the gay,

550
00:21:02,347 --> 00:21:03,948
but maybe, at least,

551
00:21:04,016 --> 00:21:05,133
they've evolved enough
to be indifferent.

552
00:21:07,936 --> 00:21:09,871
I see how miserable
you are, Dave.

553
00:21:12,141 --> 00:21:13,624
I could just hate you
when you were bullying me,

554
00:21:13,692 --> 00:21:17,245
but... now all I see
is your pain.

555
00:21:19,198 --> 00:21:20,982
And you don't have to torture
yourself over this.

556
00:21:21,033 --> 00:21:23,901
I'm not saying
you should come out tomorrow,

557
00:21:23,986 --> 00:21:27,989
but maybe, soon, the moment
will arise when you can.

558
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,241
(bell ringing)

559
00:21:31,793 --> 00:21:33,744
What's wrong?

560
00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:35,663
(crying)

561
00:21:38,584 --> 00:21:41,719
I'm so, I'm so
freaking sorry, Kurt.

562
00:21:41,787 --> 00:21:43,171
I'm just...

563
00:21:44,423 --> 00:21:48,476
...so sorry for
what I did to you.

564
00:21:48,543 --> 00:21:49,927
I know.

565
00:21:50,012 --> 00:21:51,596
I know.

566
00:21:53,015 --> 00:21:54,348
(sniffs)

567
00:21:54,399 --> 00:21:56,517
Cool.

568
00:21:56,568 --> 00:21:57,652
Thanks.

569
00:22:00,222 --> 00:22:03,524
Remember, you wait
for me here, right?

570
00:22:11,783 --> 00:22:14,585
MRS. FABRAY:
Quinny! Your date's here!

571
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,671
(sighs)

572
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:23,911
(applause)

573
00:22:23,962 --> 00:22:25,863
That's one of the good things
about being in Glee Club.

574
00:22:25,931 --> 00:22:27,882
You really get to know
your way around a cummerbund.

575
00:22:35,557 --> 00:22:37,058
(Mrs. Fabray gasps)

576
00:22:37,109 --> 00:22:38,693
Let me get
my camera.

577
00:22:40,312 --> 00:22:41,646
You look great.

578
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,147
You're the most beautiful girl

579
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:45,866
I've ever seen in my life.

580
00:22:47,653 --> 00:22:51,572
I, uh... I got you
a wrist corsage.

581
00:22:56,745 --> 00:22:59,413
The ribbon matches my eyes.
I know.

582
00:23:06,588 --> 00:23:09,640
Okay, you two,
picture time.

583
00:23:09,725 --> 00:23:11,342
You look like Cinderella.

584
00:23:11,426 --> 00:23:13,728
Let's get together. Ah!

585
00:23:13,795 --> 00:23:15,513
Okay.

586
00:23:15,597 --> 00:23:17,064
Give me prom pose.

587
00:23:17,132 --> 00:23:18,516
(shutter clicks)

588
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,602
RACHEL:
Mercedes, can I just say
that you look fierce

589
00:23:21,653 --> 00:23:23,304
in your dress?
Totally, Mercedes.

590
00:23:23,355 --> 00:23:24,972
You both
look smokin'.

591
00:23:25,023 --> 00:23:27,158
You're damn
straight we do.

592
00:23:27,242 --> 00:23:29,076
Seriously, though, Jessie, what
do you think of the bolo tie?

593
00:23:29,144 --> 00:23:29,994
Pretty cool, right?

594
00:23:30,078 --> 00:23:31,495
Saw Springsteen

595
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,365
<i>in the cover of Tunnel of Love
album wearing it.</i>

596
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:37,351
Dude, that was, like,
20 years ago.

597
00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:38,652
(laughs)

598
00:23:38,704 --> 00:23:40,421
I'm really sorry to hear

599
00:23:40,488 --> 00:23:42,323
about what happened
with your family, Sam.

600
00:23:42,374 --> 00:23:43,824
RACHEL: Um, I hope
it's okay; I sort of

601
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,259
filled Jessie in on
what was going on.

602
00:23:45,327 --> 00:23:46,510
Of course it's okay.

603
00:23:46,595 --> 00:23:47,712
Sam has nothing
to be ashamed of.

604
00:23:47,796 --> 00:23:50,348
I know how tough
it is out there.

605
00:23:50,415 --> 00:23:51,799
I couldn't even get a job

606
00:23:51,867 --> 00:23:54,101
as one of those singing waiters
at Johnny Rockets.

607
00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:56,170
But I've got an idea.

608
00:23:56,221 --> 00:23:57,521
They say that the best time

609
00:23:57,589 --> 00:23:59,223
to start any business
is during a recession.

610
00:23:59,308 --> 00:24:01,142
I don't know why,
or even what a recession is,

611
00:24:01,193 --> 00:24:03,344
but it's my understanding
that we're in one.

612
00:24:03,395 --> 00:24:05,646
He's so smart. I can't believe
he flunked out of college.

613
00:24:05,697 --> 00:24:07,014
JESSIE:
So I was thinking.

614
00:24:07,065 --> 00:24:08,983
What are the two things
that I'm great at?

615
00:24:09,034 --> 00:24:10,985
Show choir and destroying
the competition.

616
00:24:11,036 --> 00:24:14,405
So, what if I opened up
a dance studio

617
00:24:14,473 --> 00:24:16,073
where I could act
as a consultant

618
00:24:16,158 --> 00:24:18,042
for show choirs looking
to get that extra edge?

619
00:24:18,126 --> 00:24:19,610
Do you think there
are enough show choirs

620
00:24:19,678 --> 00:24:21,045
to keep you in business?

621
00:24:21,129 --> 00:24:23,130
Of course there are.
That-That's a brilliant idea!

622
00:24:23,198 --> 00:24:25,549
You could... You could be like
The-The Show Choir Whisperer.

623
00:24:25,634 --> 00:24:27,218
(laughter)

624
00:24:27,302 --> 00:24:29,804
I'm sure we could get Mr. Shue
to hire him in a second, and

625
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:31,222
that's how we can
beat Vocal Adrenaline!

626
00:24:31,306 --> 00:24:32,556
Hey, guys. You look amazing!

627
00:24:32,641 --> 00:24:35,259
And don't forget to vote
for Hudson-Fabray tonight.

628
00:24:35,344 --> 00:24:37,345
Hey, Jessie. What'd you order,
scrambled eggs?

629
00:24:37,396 --> 00:24:38,512
I mean, I know you usually

630
00:24:38,563 --> 00:24:40,264
like them served
on people's heads.

631
00:24:40,349 --> 00:24:41,382
Quinn, you look stunning.

632
00:24:41,433 --> 00:24:42,933
The ghost of Grace Kelly.

633
00:24:43,018 --> 00:24:44,018
Let me know if you get tired

634
00:24:44,069 --> 00:24:45,653
of your boyfriend
stomping on your

635
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,687
pretty little feet
all night.

636
00:24:46,738 --> 00:24:48,272
I'll be more
than happy to cut in.

637
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,407
MERCEDES:
Okay, hush, you guys.

638
00:24:49,491 --> 00:24:52,076
You're totally ruining
the vibe.

639
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,327
Quinn, you look hot.

640
00:24:53,395 --> 00:24:55,062
Finn, you look handsome.

641
00:24:55,113 --> 00:24:56,781
Love you guys,
but get lost.

642
00:24:56,865 --> 00:24:57,564
We'll see you there.

643
00:24:57,616 --> 00:24:58,899
All right.

644
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,084
This is gonna be
off the hook.

645
00:25:00,168 --> 00:25:00,935
Who's ready for some prom?

646
00:25:01,002 --> 00:25:02,119
I'm ready for prom.

647
00:25:02,204 --> 00:25:03,871
Go, prom. I like prom.
Cheers, guys.

648
00:25:03,922 --> 00:25:05,423

00:35:46,292 --> 00:35:47,960
I mean, just because
I hate everybody

863
00:35:48,011 --> 00:35:50,046
doesn't mean they have
to hate me, too.

864
00:35:50,113 --> 00:35:53,482
It's just a stupid crown
you can buy at the Party Store.

865
00:35:53,567 --> 00:35:56,719
I'm gonna be an
outsider my whole life.

866
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:59,989
Can't I just... have one
night where I'm queen?

867
00:36:00,073 --> 00:36:01,273
I'm not going
back in there.

868
00:36:01,324 --> 00:36:02,858
Where I'm accepted?

869
00:36:02,943 --> 00:36:05,361
No way.
There's no way I'm
staying at this school

870
00:36:05,445 --> 00:36:06,529
I'm gonna transfer.

871
00:36:06,613 --> 00:36:07,997
Soon as we get
to New York,

872
00:36:08,081 --> 00:36:09,782
I'm bailing to live
in a lesbian colony.

873
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:12,651
Or Tribeca.

874
00:36:12,702 --> 00:36:14,653
Would you at least sit down?

875
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,258
Do you want to go?

876
00:36:19,325 --> 00:36:21,844
We don't have to
go back in there.

877
00:36:21,928 --> 00:36:24,163
Wasn't this prom supposed
to be about redemption?

878
00:36:24,214 --> 00:36:26,265
About taking away
that lump you had

879
00:36:26,332 --> 00:36:27,933
in your throat
from running away?

880
00:36:28,001 --> 00:36:30,886
If we leave, all it's gonna do
is give me a lump, too.

881
00:36:30,954 --> 00:36:32,221
So what do you want to do?

882
00:36:38,278 --> 00:36:41,397
I'm gonna go back in there
and get coronated.

883
00:36:43,316 --> 00:36:45,818
I'm gonna show them that
it doesn't matter if they are

884
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:47,019
yelling at me

885
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,021
or whispering behind my back,

886
00:36:49,089 --> 00:36:50,422
they can't touch me.

887
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:53,242
<i>That they can't touch us.</i>

888
00:36:54,461 --> 00:36:55,828
Or what we have.

889
00:36:55,879 --> 00:36:58,631
Most girls would be upset
about being slapped in the face,

890
00:36:58,698 --> 00:37:00,866
but I happen to
appreciate the drama of it.

891
00:37:04,504 --> 00:37:08,307
I know you think it's
hard to be you, Rachel,

892
00:37:08,374 --> 00:37:11,477
but at least you don't have
to be terrified all the time.

893
00:37:11,544 --> 00:37:13,762
What are you so scared of?

894
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,717
The future.

895
00:37:19,903 --> 00:37:22,238
When all this is gone.

896
00:37:22,322 --> 00:37:25,741
You have nothing
to be scared of.

897
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:28,410
You're a very
pretty girl, Quinn.

898
00:37:28,478 --> 00:37:31,914
You're the prettiest girl
I've ever met, but...

899
00:37:31,982 --> 00:37:34,416
you're a lot more than that.

900
00:37:34,501 --> 00:37:36,502
(sighs)

901
00:37:36,569 --> 00:37:37,753
Here.

902
00:37:39,756 --> 00:37:40,789
Can I help?

903
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:44,793
They must have sensed
that I was a lesbian.

904
00:37:44,878 --> 00:37:47,213
I mean, they must have.
Do I smell like a golf course?

905
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,580
People don't know
what you're hiding,

906
00:37:48,632 --> 00:37:50,983
they just... they know
that you're not being yourself.

907
00:37:51,051 --> 00:37:52,351
If you were
to embrace all

908
00:37:52,418 --> 00:37:54,637
the awesomeness that you
are, you would've won.

909
00:37:55,805 --> 00:37:57,489
How do you know?

910
00:37:57,557 --> 00:37:59,808
Because I voted for you.

911
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:05,881
And because I believe
in you, Santana.

912
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,221
(sobs)
This prom sucks!

913
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:15,591
Now what am I supposed to do?

914
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:17,993
Go back out there and
be there for Kurt.

915
00:38:18,061 --> 00:38:20,246
This is gonna be a
lot harder for him
than it is for you.

916
00:38:29,372 --> 00:38:30,839
Are you ready for this?

917
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,894
Well, Stumbles,
it's 10:00 p.m.

918
00:38:34,961 --> 00:38:36,812
You've officially
missed your prom.

919
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,264
I'm not gonna
rat somebody out

920
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:39,631
for doing something
that I did.

921
00:38:39,683 --> 00:38:41,016
(sighs) I was upset,

922
00:38:41,101 --> 00:38:43,185
and I wanted
to impress a girl.

923
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:45,354
But I wasn't down on
getting everybody wasted,

924
00:38:45,438 --> 00:38:48,157
so I poured a flask of
lemonade into the punch.

925
00:38:48,241 --> 00:38:49,191
Wait.

926
00:38:49,276 --> 00:38:50,859
You didn't
spike the punch?

927
00:38:50,944 --> 00:38:52,027
Yes, I did.

928
00:38:52,112 --> 00:38:53,245
With alcohol?

929
00:38:53,313 --> 00:38:56,098
Oh. Yeah, then
no, I didn't.

930
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:57,783
Well, why didn't you
tell me that before?

931
00:38:57,834 --> 00:39:00,502
I was just about to pull out
a couple of your molars.

932
00:39:01,988 --> 00:39:03,989
So, can I go?

933
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,674
You should really
be ashamed of yourself.

934
00:39:05,759 --> 00:39:06,959
You are seriously

935
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:09,094
no fun to interrogate
or almost torture.

936
00:39:09,162 --> 00:39:11,997
(low, indistinct chatter)

937
00:39:20,223 --> 00:39:23,475
(chatter stops)

938
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:30,199
(whispers):
Oh, my God,

939
00:39:30,283 --> 00:39:31,700
I feel so bad for him.

940
00:39:31,785 --> 00:39:33,369
FIGGINS:
Ladies and gentlemen,

941
00:39:33,453 --> 00:39:36,322
your 2011 Prom Queen,

942
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:38,374
Kurt Hummel.

943
00:39:59,846 --> 00:40:01,897
Eat your heart out,
Kate Middleton.

944
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:04,566
(scattered chuckles)

945
00:40:04,651 --> 00:40:06,018
(scattered applause)

946
00:40:06,069 --> 00:40:08,237
(Figgins laughing)
(applause growing)

947
00:40:08,321 --> 00:40:10,823
(whooping, cheering)

948
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:14,310
(whooping, cheering continue)

949
00:40:19,082 --> 00:40:20,866
(clears throat)

950
00:40:20,917 --> 00:40:23,285
(whooping, cheering continue)

951
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:26,505
FIGGINS: And now, behold
the tradition of our 2011

952
00:40:26,572 --> 00:40:28,090
Prom King and Queen

953
00:40:28,174 --> 00:40:31,393
sharing their first dance.

954
00:40:31,461 --> 00:40:32,961
(applause)

955
00:40:35,415 --> 00:40:37,082
Now's your moment.

956
00:40:38,601 --> 00:40:40,585
What?

957
00:40:40,637 --> 00:40:41,804
Come out.

958
00:40:41,888 --> 00:40:43,272
