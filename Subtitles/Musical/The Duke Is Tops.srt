00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:05,670
Grow hair, sir?

529
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,990
I'm glad you brought that up.

530
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,630
I ask you to look
at the good doctor

531
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,890
And notice that
luxuriant growth of hair.

532
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,070
Why, four years ago
the doctor fell ill

533
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:15,210
With sinfaletosis
of the metatarsal,

534
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,920
A very dangerous disease.

535
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,660
And all of his hair fell out,
but thanks to the Universal

536
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,690
Elixir but why go on, why go on?

537
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:26,430
Doctor show them what Universal
Elixir has done for you.

538
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:52,330
I knew it, I knew it.

539
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:53,360
It's a fake.

540
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,390
Now, Sheriff, do your duty.

541
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:59,880
I'll give you just five minutes
to be one mile out of town.

542
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,380
Ah, Doc, ah, we're leaving.

543
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,370
So I anticipated.

544
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,870
Ah, Joe, Joe.

545
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:05,870
Move those chairs.

546
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,860
Start packing.

547
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,360
Ah, Dippy, hook up the car!

548
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:30,990
Well, it looks like Old Man
Jinks is with me permanent.

549
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:33,140
Don't let a little
thing like that getcha.

550
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,550
Why, when I really
bear down, we'll

551
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:37,150
Be selling more stuff than any
medicine show in the business.

552
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:40,090
No, Duke, it ain't no use.

553
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,450
Forget it, Doc.

554
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:43,960
I've got more ideas
than a clock has ticks.

555
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,690
And the first idea
is in the future

556
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:49,330
We're going to glue
that wig on, tight.

557
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,030
Ooh.

558
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,010
For Pete's sake.

559
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:57,400
Hey there.

560
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,710
Imp of darkness and
demon of disaster.

561
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,450
Smells like the coffee's ready.

562
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:05,540
Now, for the eats.

563
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,970
[CRICKETS CHIRPING]

564
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:33,410
Say, Joe, here's a good spot to
turn off the main drag, 'cause

565
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:35,320
Them folks back
there sure hostile.

566
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,020
Looks kind of rough to me.

567
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,070
Yes, but I ain't
taking no chances.

568
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,070
OK by me.

569
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,700
Suffering [INAUDIBLE].

570
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,690
Doc, the place is on fire.

571
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:06,690
Here put your foot up here, Doc.

572
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:12,670
Let me get that out for
you. [INAUDIBLE] Doc,

573
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,670
The water thing ain't working.

574
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,370
What no water?

575
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,670
No.

576
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,970
Get some blankets.

577
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:17,670
Ok, quick.

578
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,460
Quick, Doc!

579
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,160
Dippy!

580
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:20,960
Joe!

581
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,660
Dippy!

582
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:35,130
Dippy!

583
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:35,930
Dippy!

584
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:36,630
No!

585
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,580
Get out of here!

586
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,510
Let's get out of here!

587
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,210
Come on.

588
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:02,910
Come on.

589
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,960
Ha ha ha.

590
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,640
Some christening, Doc!

591
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,630
Through fire and water,
we can't fail now!

592
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:22,600
(SINGING) Oh,
[INAUDIBLE] romance should

593
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,580
Keep it's [INAUDIBLE]
[INAUDIBLE].

594
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:30,070
Match that the true
love's trespasses

595
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:34,050
Dissipation only ends in defeat.

596
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:43,490
Don't let our love
song turn into a blues.

597
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:55,530
As long as life lasts, let's
be true to one another.

598
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:56,340
Did I steer you right?

599
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,670
She's got it, hasn't she?

600
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:01,210
(SINGING) our hearts
[INAUDIBLE] with sad melody.

601
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:11,040
True love will guide us
through stormy weather.

602
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:18,480
Everyone should be
true to his own.

603
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,450
Let's make sure before
this chance is flown.

604
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:27,100
We won't disagree
on many things.

605
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:34,800
Just get along together like
a romance in the spring.

606
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:41,240
Our love both must not be
lost on it's [INAUDIBLE].

607
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:52,240
Don't let our love
song turn into a blues.

608
00:42:55,740 --> 00:43:00,740
Everyone should be
true to his own.

609
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:07,250
Oh, let's make sure before
this chance is flown.

610
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:12,120
We won't disagree
on anything just

611
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:19,290
Get along together like
a romance in the spring.

612
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:26,400
Our love both must not be
lost on it's [INAUDIBLE].

613
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:38,660
Don't let our love
song turn into a blues.

614
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,620
[APPLAUSE]

615
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:54,310
I like her in Broadway,
well, more than like her.

616
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:56,360
She'll wow 'em at
your Century Club.

617
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,770
Bring her up to my
office in the morning.

618
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,180
That a girl, Ethel.

619
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,670
I knew you'd do it.

620
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:37,110
[APPLAUSE]

621
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,120
Thank you, folks.

622
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,870
Thank you, thank you.

623
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:45,430
And now folks, I wonder if you'd
mind stepping down a little bit

624
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:48,500
Closer, so I won't have
to... not too close ladies.

625
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,870
The kerosene from
the lamp is leaking

626
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:51,390
And is liable to
get on your clothes.

627
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:53,680
Friends, I'm here
to introduce Doctor

628
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,150
Dorando's Universal Elixir.

629
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:59,440
The average adult... by adult I
mean a person who has stopped

630
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,670
Growing at both ends and
started in the middle.

631
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:07,010
The minute a man like that
get's sick he runs to a doctor

632
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:09,770
And the doctor tells
him... which reminds me,

633
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:13,340
I had a patient come to me, a
little fellow with a glass eye.

634
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,280
He didn't tell me it was
a glass eye, of course.

635
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:20,270
It happen to come out
during the conversation.

636
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:21,760
Ain't he a [INAUDIBLE].

637
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,310
Ah ha, you see it.

638
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:24,340
He didn't.

639
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,060
Anyway, this man went
to another doctor,

640
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,130
A foreigner, an alienist.

641
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:31,320
This doctor told him, you
are not going to get well,

642
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,810
But to make sure you're
not going to get well,

643
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:36,020
I will call in another doctor.

644
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:38,740
Now, the other doctor
told him that he

645
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:40,650
Was threatened with paralysis.

646
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:41,550
[LAUGHTER]

647
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:42,740
Why do you laugh, brother?

648
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,360
Don't you realize it's an
awful thing to be paralyzed?

649
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:49,660
Sure is, you feel so
rotten in the morning.

650
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:52,470
I don't know you, my friend,
but I think you show poor taste

651
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,630
To laugh at so
serious a subject.

652
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:56,370
Anyway, this man
finally came to us

653
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:59,510
And Doctor Dorando, whom I
shall introduce presently,

654
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:01,650
Diagnosed his case
as stomach trouble.

655
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:04,890
Friends, do you realize that the
death rate on stomach trouble

656
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:09,820
A year averages one
death per person.

657
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,250
Ah, you may laugh,
but that's a fact.

658
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:14,590
Doctor Dorando put
this man on a milk diet

659
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:16,780
Until he was strong enough
to take his medicine.

660
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:19,420
And that man would be alive
today it he hadn't a...

661
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:21,300
Died.

662
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,730
Oh no my friend, if
he hadn't held out

663
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:27,890
The Saturday night's
paycheck on his wife.

664
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:30,660
Now before I go on with my
talk I have a treat for you.

665
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:33,410
I should like to introduce
the Dorando and Davis

666
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:36,980
World famous quartet,
The Cats and the Fiddle.

667
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,630
Come along and swing
it for them, boys.

668
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:50,720
(SINGING) He's the man
that smokes that jive.

669
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,630
That jive will take
you for a dive.

670
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:57,050
One sip you will arrive.

671
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:59,190
When you smoke
that killin' jive.

672
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:01,180
It will make you very tall.

673
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:04,650
Seems that if you're
going to fall,

674
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:07,480
Knock yourself out for a ride.

675
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,880
I mean that killin' jive.

676
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,320
You will think
you'll blow your top.

677
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,730
Baby you start laughing
and you can't stop.

678
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:17,810
Now won't you give
him a smile 'cause

679
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:20,610
He's a sad man not bad man.

680
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:23,050
Everything will seem so funny.

681
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:25,980
Darkest days will seem so sunny.

682
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:30,730
That feeling will arrive when
you smoke that killin' jive.

683
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:56,570
[SCAT SINGING]

684
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:32,790
Sad man not bad man.

685
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:36,240
Everything will seem so funny.

686
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,200
Darkest days will seem so sunny.

687
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:44,130
That feeling will arrive when
you're a high man, [INAUDIBLE]

688
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:46,100
Man, you're in the sky, man.

689
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,080
You're on the rip, man.

690
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:51,220
You'll been so mellow,
just like a jello

691
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,840
When you smoke
that killin' jive.

692
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:03,430
Hey, Duke sure knows
how to get 'em, don't he?

693
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:04,670
You telling me?

694
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:12,370
And now for the real
treat of the evening.

695
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:14,620
It gives me a great
deal of pleasure

696
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:19,100
To introduce Doctor Dorando, the
discoverer of Universal Elixir,

697
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:22,400
Himself in person...
Doctor Dorando.

698
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,870
[APPLAUSE]

699
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:35,980
Yes, it's a man that
has done more for mankind

700
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,980
With his Universal

Maybe I am a cyclist!

875
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:40,760
We were just talking about you.

876
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,620
Well, am I invited in?

877
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:51,960
Duke, I just found out
what you did for me.

878
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:54,280
And I just found out
what they did to you.

879
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:57,080
All I want is 15 minutes
with that Fenton fellow.

880
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:57,780
Forget him, Duke.

881
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:00,610
You can't hurt him,
it wasn't his fault.

882
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:01,310
Hurt him?

883
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:03,050
I'm going to do him good.

884
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:06,010

'em at that Century Club.

Ferdie Fenton whose last Century
Club show went sour on him,

889
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,280
Wasted no time in
calling in a doctor, one

890
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:23,760
Duke Davis, a newcomer
from the sticks.

891
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:28,060
The medicine is said to be new
faces, novel ideas and... well

892
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:31,230
Ferdie, you're either a genius
or a glutton for punishment.

893
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:33,460
Anyway, good luck with
your new producer...
