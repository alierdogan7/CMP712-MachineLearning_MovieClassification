1
00:00:08,033 --> 00:00:25,033
**

2
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:39,300
**

3
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,900
**

4
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:46,667
How many times we gotta fix

5
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:47,733
This old fence?

6
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:48,800
Easier to tear it down and start

7
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,267
Over.

8
00:00:52,267 --> 00:00:54,000
[Barking]

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,067
Not you again!

10
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:56,100
Look'it!

11
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,567
Look'it!

12
00:01:00,567 --> 00:01:02,700
It looks like he wet himself.

13
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,267
That's a big old scaredy cat.

14
00:01:05,267 --> 00:01:07,200
You go ahead and laugh.

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,233
He can't bite through that brace

16
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:13,533
On your leg.

17
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:14,533
Toto!

18
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:15,100
Toto!

19
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,667
Toto, come back here.

20
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:17,700
Morning, miss Dorothy.

21
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,400
Robert found your dog for you.

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,300
I told you; You can't come

23
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,867
With me.

24
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:21,967
Somebody takin' a trip?

25
00:01:21,967 --> 00:01:22,667
Or running away from home

26
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:23,533
Again?

27
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:24,600
You can't run away from home

28
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,667
If you're not home to start

29
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:26,700
With.

30
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,767
Don't she live here?

31
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:29,333
Could'a sworn she lived here.

32
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:30,400
Dorothy Gail, I am too old to

33
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,433
Be chasin' you down.

34
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:32,567
I swear I don't know who needs a

35
00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:34,100
Leash more; You or that dog.

36
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,667
Morning, miss em.

37
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:37,267
And why are you three

38
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:38,800
Standing 'round?

39
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,900
Can't you see the leaves turning

40
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,567
Over?

41
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:41,467
Storm's coming.

42
00:01:41,467 --> 00:01:42,567
Can't you see?

43
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:44,133
We're still cleaning up the

44
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:45,167
Last.

45
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:46,233
Go on, get everything back to

46
00:01:46,233 --> 00:01:47,300
The barn.

47
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,333
Lock down the shutters and turn

48
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:49,367
The horses out.

49
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:51,067
Yes, ma'am.

50
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:58,333
And take this dog with you.

51
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,433
So, I guess you won't be helping

52
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:01,533
Me with the laundry today.

53
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:02,600
Oh, Dorothy.

54
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,167
I don't know what to do with

55
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:05,267
You.

56
00:02:05,267 --> 00:02:06,233
You don't gotta do nothing.

57
00:02:06,233 --> 00:02:07,333
Well, that'll make a nice

58
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:08,067
Break from worrying about you

59
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:09,467
Day and night.

60
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:10,067
Why should you worry?

61
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:14,200
You're not my mother.

62
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,767
No, I'm your mother's big

63
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:16,833
Sister.

64
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,933
And when you get your face all

65
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:19,633
Balled up mad like that it's

66
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:20,700
Almost like having her back with

67
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,067
Me.

68
00:02:22,067 --> 00:02:25,200
You're so like her.

69
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,367
Stubborn, strong, smart and

70
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:31,533
Beautiful...

71
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:33,133
I don't belong here.

72
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:34,667
I hate that school and everyone

73
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:35,733
In it.

74
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:37,333
I hate this place.

75
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,933
I wanna go back home where I

76
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:40,600
Come from.

77
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,567
Sweet girl, if I had the

78
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:44,233
Magic to put your mama and daddy

79
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:45,300
Back in that house for you, I'd

80
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,400
Snap my fingers and they'd be

81
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,900
There waitin' supper.

82
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,967
But you know as well as me your

83
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:50,067
Folks are gone.

84
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:51,067
Gone, baby.

85
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:52,100
Lost in that accident.

86
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,200
And all the wishin' in the world

87
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,733
Ain't changing that.

88
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:55,800
Back there's my home.

89
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,867
Back there's nothing but an

90
00:02:56,867 --> 00:02:58,967
Empty apartment.

91
00:02:58,967 --> 00:03:01,600
And my school and my friends,

92
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,633
And nobody riding me to do

93
00:03:02,633 --> 00:03:04,200
Chores or watching over every

94
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,233
Little thing I do twenty-four

95
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:06,800
Hours a day.

96
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,967
I remember a time, not so

97
00:03:07,967 --> 00:03:09,467
Long ago, you used to like me

98
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:12,667
Watchin' over you.

99
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:14,200
Used to be your favorite aunt.

100
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,233
I remember how you come running

101
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:16,367
To hide yourself behind my apron

102
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:18,067
At bath time.

103
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:18,933
Anything to avoid your mama's

104
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,567
Soap and washcloth.

105
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,433
You think I give you chores to

106
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:24,200
Be ornery?

107
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,267
Being part of a family

108
00:03:25,267 --> 00:03:26,833
Guarantees you always got love,

109
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,433
But you got responsibility too.

110
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:30,067
Home is something got to be

111
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:32,100
Earned.

112
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,167
Storm's not waiting on one

113
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:33,833
Little girl to come to her

114
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:34,733
Senses.

115
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:36,400
Let's go, child.

116
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,567
We need to get to shelter.

117
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:43,700
Much as I love you, much as I

118
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,767
Think I know what's right, I

119
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:46,333
Can't lock you up in your room

120
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,900
The rest of your life.

121
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,467
All I can do is pray you'll

122
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:50,567
Choose the path that will lead

123
00:03:50,567 --> 00:03:53,100
You back to the ones who love

124
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,500
You.

125
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,600
**

126
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,167
* put your arms around me

127
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:06,867
Child like when you bumped

128
00:04:06,867 --> 00:04:09,500
Your shin then you'll know

129
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,167
I love you now *

130
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:18,433
* as I loved you then

131
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:21,567
Though you may be trying

132
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:23,667
Sometimes and I'll need you

133
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:26,833
And you're not there *

134
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,067
* I may get mad

135
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:33,700
And turn you away

136
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:38,567
But lord knows I still care

137
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:42,733
But you cannot ask *

138
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:46,833
* for more than can

139
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:50,067
Come from me I am different

140
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:52,633
Than you are and one day

141
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:57,933
You'll see *

142
00:04:57,933 --> 00:05:00,533
* if I lose my patience

143
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:03,200
With you and suddenly

144
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,367
Start to scream

145
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:08,933
It's only because *

146
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:12,667
* I want you to be

147
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:16,400
Everything I see in my dreams

148
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,067
And I'd like to know

149
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:22,700
That it's there *

150
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,900
* the feeling we once had

151
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,533
When you know that you can

152
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:31,667
You can come to me

153
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:33,233
Whenever you're *

154
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:36,367
* feeling bad

155
00:05:36,367 --> 00:05:38,467
Don't lose the feeling

156
00:05:38,467 --> 00:05:40,067
We once had

157
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:41,667
Don't lose the feeling *

158
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:44,833
* we once had

159
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,933
Though you're growing

160
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:50,100
Older now and

161
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:55,367
I'm watching you grow *

162
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:57,467
* and if I make you

163
00:05:57,467 --> 00:06:00,167
Sad sometimes

164
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:03,267
I see your feelings show

165
00:06:03,267 --> 00:06:06,400
But one day *

166
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,233
* I'll look around

167
00:06:10,233 --> 00:06:14,300
And you will be grown

168
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,967
You'll be out in the world

169
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:19,100
Such a pretty little girl *

170
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,633
* but you'll be out there

171
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:23,900
On your own

172
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,400
You'll be on your own

173
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,967
And I'd like to know *

174
00:06:26,967 --> 00:06:30,200
* that it's there

175
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,867
The feeling we once had

176
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:35,433
Don't lose the feelin'

177
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:37,067
When you know that you can *

178
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:39,633
* you can come to me

179
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:46,500
Whenever you're feeling bad

180
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,133
The feeling we once had

181
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:51,800
Don't lose it *

182
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,500
* the feeling we once had

183
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:03,900
That we had that we had

184
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,867
This storm means business we

185
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:13,467
Best get inside.

186
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:28,533

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,467
Aunt em?

197
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:23,233
Aunt em, where are you?

198
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:24,300
Aunt em?

199
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,367
Aunt em?

200
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:26,400
Aunt em?

201
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,433
Aunt em?

202
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,067
Who's saying that?

203
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:31,133
Who's saying what?

204
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:32,200
Who are you?

205
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,767
I'll be the one askin' the

206
00:09:33,767 --> 00:09:36,433
Questions from here on out.

207
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:37,467
From here on in.

208
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:40,633
From here on in or out!

209
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:41,200
This here's a murder

210
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,233
Investigation.

211
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:43,500
Murder?

212
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,300
Murder!

213
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,067
I don't know anything about

214
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:45,833
Any murder.

215
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:46,933
That's what they all say.

216
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:47,967
Is that there your house?

217
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:50,067
It's my aunt em's house.

218
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:52,700
Ask her about these feet!

219
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,767
And are those feet stickin'

220
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:54,800
Out from under your aunt em's

221
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,533
House?

222
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,000
I don't know.

223
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,900
It appears so.

224
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,967
And is the person attached to

225
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:03,500
Them feet dead?

226
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,533
How do I know?

227
00:10:04,533 --> 00:10:06,133
I'm no doctor.

228
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:06,833
There's a house sitting on

229
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:07,667
Top of her.

230
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:08,733
You do the math.

231
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:12,433
Let the witness answer!

232
00:10:12,433 --> 00:10:13,533
I don't know.

233
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:14,500
It appears so.

234
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,600
And there you have it...

235
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,633
A murder victim, a murder weapon

236
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:18,200
And a murder suspect.

237
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,233
What say the jury?

238
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:20,267
Guilty!

239
00:10:20,267 --> 00:10:21,367
You have heard the findings

240
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:22,933
Of this court.

241
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:23,967
We declare you guilty of murder

242
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:26,100
In the house degree.

243
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:32,400
Bailiff, throw her a party!

244
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,467
What?

245
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,500
Congratulations!

246
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,533
I don't understand.

247
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:36,600
You just killed evvamean, the

248
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,633
Wicked witch of the east, and we

249
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:45,333
Can't thank you enough!

250
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,567
**

251
00:10:50,367 --> 00:10:51,433
Where is it?

252
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:52,467
Where's that house I seen flying

253
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:53,500
By?

254
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,567
Addaperle!

255
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:55,067
Atta' girl!

256
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:56,133
Who is she?

257
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:57,200
Who is she?

258
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,300
I'm the good witch of the north.

259
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,867
Don't ring a bell?

260
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:02,967
Perhaps you know me by my stage

261
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:04,533
Name, "addaperle, the feel-good"

262
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:06,100
Girl."

263
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,733
I got a little magic act.

264
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:14,567
[Applause]

265
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:15,600
I do tricks.

266
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,700
Does she ever!

267
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,767
Could you please tell me

268
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:20,333
Where I am?

269
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,400
Lost, are you? I know what

270
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,467
That's like.

271
00:11:22,467 --> 00:11:23,500
Sometimes I nod out on the bus

272
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,500
And end up in all sorts of

273
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,600
Unfamiliar places.

274
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
But let's see if I can help you

275
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,233
Out.

276
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:29,767
That there is a munchkin.

277
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:31,367
And that there is a munchkin.

278
00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:32,400
And that there is a munchkin.

279
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,500
So I'd say it's a pretty good

280
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,567
Bet that you're in munchkinland,

281
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:36,633
In the good ole U.S. of oz.

282
00:11:36,633 --> 00:11:39,800
Am I right?

283
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,367
Addaperle, girl, there's

284
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,433
Something I think you ought'a

285
00:11:42,433 --> 00:11:45,567
See.

286
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:46,633
Yeah!

287
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:48,200
That's it!

288
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,267
That's the thing almost knocked

289
00:11:49,267 --> 00:11:50,867
Me out the sky!

290
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:52,967
But lookie here.

291
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:54,500
Is that?

292
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,167
It couldn't be.

293
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:59,800
Oh, no, not my sister!

294
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,367
Please don't tell me somebody

295
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:02,933
Squished my poor, heartless,

296
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:04,500
Rotten, evil, older, twisted

297
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,733
Sister evvamean!

298
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:10,800
Somebody tell me who to thank.

299
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,400
She done it!

300
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,500
Really?

301
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,567
You're awful young to be killing

302
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:17,600
Witches.

303
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,667
Do you have a license?

304
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:19,733
Do I what?

305
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:20,800
You ain't lookin' to kill no

306
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,833
More witches, are you?

307
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:22,367
Of course not.

308
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,400
Good.

309
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,467
'Cause there's only three of us

310
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:25,533
Left.

311
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:29,867
Me, the good witch of the north.

312
00:12:29,867 --> 00:12:31,600
[Applause]

313
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,667
Evillene, the wicked witch of

314
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:33,967
The west.

315
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:35,767
[Audience booing]

316
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:37,300
And our other sister glinda, the

317
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,467
Good witch of the South.

318
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:42,567
Yeah, she's something.

319
00:12:42,567 --> 00:12:43,633
You should catch her act while

320
00:12:43,633 --> 00:12:44,700
You're in town.

321
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,700
Girl's got pipes.

322
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,800
But back to our story... who are

323
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,833
You?

324
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,167
No!

325
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:49,933
I will tell you with help from

326
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:51,533
My magic slate.

327
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:52,600
Magic slate?

328
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,733
It's an apple.

329
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:55,767
Now, without my touching it your

330
00:12:55,767 --> 00:12:56,833
Name will appear here plain as

331
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:57,367
Day.

332
00:12:57,367 --> 00:13:01,567
And that name is...

333
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,167
Shirley!

334
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:04,233
No.

335
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:06,333
Not Shirley.

336
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,400
Shirleen!

337
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,967
Nope.

338
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:10,067
Shirletta!

339
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:11,600
Not even close.

340
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,633
Charmaine?

341
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:14,533
Champagne?

342
00:13:14,533 --> 00:13:15,833
Chuck!

343
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:16,867
No.

344
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:17,933
You sure you ain't Charmaine?

345
00:13:17,933 --> 00:13:18,967
Lemme see some i.D.

346
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:20,067
My name is...

347
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:21,100
Did I say don't tell me?

348
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,367
Write it down.

349
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:27,433
Dorothy.

350
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:28,467
Dorothy?

351
00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:31,633
Really?

352
00:13:31,633 --> 00:13:33,233
Your name is... Dorothy!

353
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:36,900
[Applause]

354
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,933
Whatever.

355
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:39,067
What can I do for you?

356
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:40,600
For me?

357
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,667
You freed the munchkins from

358
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:43,233
The evil rule of evvamean.

359
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:44,300
The least I can do is take you

360
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,600
Out to lunch.

361
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,933
You like Sushi?

362
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:48,067
Can you help me get home?

363
00:13:48,067 --> 00:13:49,567
Where's that?

364
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:50,633
I'm trying to get to Omaha

365
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:52,233
Where I was born.

366
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:53,800
No can do.

367
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,867
That falls under the heading of

368
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:55,900
Transporting a minor across

369
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,067
State lines.

370
00:13:58,067 --> 00:13:59,067
I'm afraid you're gonna have to

371
00:13:59,067 --> 00:14:01,167
See the wiz.

372
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:02,233
The wiz?

373
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:03,300
Yeah!

374
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:03,800
The wiz.

375
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,867
I bet he could get you home.

376
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:05,933
He can do anything.

377
00:14:05,933 --> 00:14:07,500
He's the wiz!

378
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,667
Who's the wiz?

379
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:12,267

380

And the way things are *

Never take them off, not 'til

00:17:03,433 --> 00:17:05,067
You get home.

465
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:06,100

If you go around blabbin' it?

471
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,400

From what?

478
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,500
All kind'a whatnot.

But now I must go!

So, goodbye.

I said, goodbye!

489
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,500

00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,567
You get me a new battery like I

00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:54,700
Give it a shake and lean on

493
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,867
The clutch.

494
00:17:57,867 --> 00:18:06,833
I said good-bye!

495
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:07,867
Wait.

496
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:08,933
You didn't tell me where to find

497
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:10,533
The wiz.

498
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:12,100
No hay problemo.

499
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,667
Wiz lives in the emerald city.

500
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:14,267
And where's that at?

501
00:18:14,267 --> 00:18:15,267
Oh, darling, you can't miss

502
00:18:15,267 --> 00:18:16,867
It.

503
00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:18,967
It's big and it's green and it's

504
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:21,267
Right at the end of the yellow

505
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,700
Brick road.

506
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,300
The yellow brick road?

507
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,400
Just stay on the yellow brick

508
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,367
Road and you can't miss it.

509
00:18:26,367 --> 00:18:27,433
But watch out for the winged

510
00:18:27,433 --> 00:18:28,500
Warriors.

511
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,833
The winged what?

512
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:30,600
And the kalidahs.

513
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,667
Who are they?

514
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:32,700
They're shape shifters.

515
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,767
And mind readers.

516
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:34,800
And they will charm them

517
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,500
Slippers right off your feet.

518
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,367
And don't forget to warn her

519
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:37,400
About the poppies.

520
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,467
Poppies?

521
00:18:38,467 --> 00:18:40,600
Like flowers?

522
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,633
What I gotta be scared of

523
00:18:41,633 --> 00:18:44,400
Flowers for?

524
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,133
Sometimes the most dangerous

525
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:45,900
Things are also the most

526
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,900
Beautiful.

527
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,067
That's deep, cuz.

528
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:49,133
They lure you in, and once

529
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:50,100
They get their tendrils on you,

530
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,700
They never let you go.

531
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,267
They put you to work feeding and

532
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:54,300
Watering and plowing their

533
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,367
Fields from sunrise to sunset

534
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,400
Until the first frost sets you

535
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,433
Free.

536
00:18:57,433 --> 00:18:59,600
But it ain't all bad.

537
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,967
You get a lot of fresh air.

538
00:19:01,967 --> 00:19:02,767
Addaperle said something

539
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:03,833
About the wicked witch of the

540
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,467
West.

541
00:19:05,467 --> 00:19:06,133
Oh, you don't gotta fret

542
00:19:06,133 --> 00:19:06,933
About her.

543
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:08,300
Seein' how you off'ed her

544
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,067
Sister, if she gets her hands on

545
00:19:09,067 --> 00:19:11,200
You, she'll slice, dice and deep

546
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,233
Fry your butt 'fore you can

547
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:13,300
Blink.

548
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,367
So, no sense worrying about her.

549
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:16,433
Have a nice trip.

550
00:19:16,433 --> 00:19:17,500
Regards to the wiz!

551
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,333
Goodbye!

552
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,533
Regards to the wiz!

553
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:23,600
Just follow the yellow brick

554
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,700
Road?

555
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,767
That's right.

556
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:26,800
Just follow the yellow brick

557
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,933
Road.

558
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:31,067
But where is the yellow brick

559
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:33,600
Road?

560
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:37,700
**

561
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,900
* there's a feeling here inside

562
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,533
That I cannot hide *

563
00:19:41,533 --> 00:19:43,133
* and I know I've tried

564
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:48,900
But it's turning me around *

565
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,067
* I'm not sure that I'm aware

566
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:52,600
If I'm up or down

567
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,667
If I'm here or there *

568
00:19:54,667 --> 00:20:00,067
* I need both feet on the ground

569
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:02,200
Why do I feel like I'm

570
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,767
Drowning *

571
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:12,567
* when there is plenty of air?

572
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:17,300
Why do I feel like frowning? *

573
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:22,567
* I think the feeling is fear

574
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:24,133
Here I am in a different place *

575
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:25,200
* in a different time

576
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,300
In this time and space *

577
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:33,567
* but I don't want to be here

578
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:35,700
I was told I must see the wiz *

579
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,300
* but I don't know what a wizard

580
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,933
Is

581
00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:45,733
I just hope the wiz is there *

582
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:51,600
* maybe I'm just going crazy

583
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:57,333
Letting myself get uptight *

584
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:03,633
* I'm acting just like a baby

585
00:21:03,633 --> 00:21:11,600
I'm gonna be all right *

586
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:18,933
* soon as I get home

587
00:21:18,933 --> 00:21:23,700
Soon as I get home

588
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,267
In a different place

589
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:28,433
In a different time *

590
00:21:28,433 --> 00:21:32,633
* different people around me

591
00:21:32,633 --> 00:21:37,667
I would like to know *

592
00:21:37,667 --> 00:21:40,133
* of their different world

593
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:43,833
And how different they find me *

594
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:44,867
* and just what's a wiz

595
00:21:44,867 --> 00:21:45,900
Is it big?

596
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,967
Will it scare me? *

597
00:21:46,967 --> 00:21:49,567
* if I ask to leave

598
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:53,767
Will the wiz even hear me? *

599
00:21:53,767 --> 00:21:59,067
* how will I know then

600
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:04,867
If I'll ever get home again? *

601
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:08,067
* here I am alone

602
00:22:08,067 --> 00:22:10,167
Though it feels the same *

603
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:13,833
* I don't know where I'm going

604
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,933
Out here on my own

605
00:22:15,933 --> 00:22:19,633
And it's not a game *

606
00:22:19,633 --> 00:22:23,867
* and a strange wind is blowing

607
00:22:23,867 --> 00:22:26,500
I am so amazed *

608
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,667
* by the things that I see here

609
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:31,233
I don't want to be afraid *

610
00:22:31,233 --> 00:22:35,067
* I just don't wanna to be here

611
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:38,133
In my mind, this is clear *

612
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:44,433
* what am I doing here?

613
00:22:44,433 --> 00:22:47,600
I wish I was

614
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:58,733
Home **

615
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:02,667
What d'ya know?

616
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:05,200
A yellow brick road!

617
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:16,067
**

618
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,267
Why hello there.

619
00:23:31,267 --> 00:23:31,833
Got any spare change?

620
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:32,867
Loose bills?

621
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:33,967
Maybe some dirty old dollars

622
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:34,967
Cluttering up your purse?

623
00:23:34,967 --> 00:23:36,533
Did you say that?

624
00:23:36,533 --> 00:23:39,533
Did I say what?

625
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:40,133
A talking scarecrow?

626
00:23:40,133 --> 00:23:40,767
Where?

627
00:23:40,767 --> 00:23:42,333
You!

628
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:43,400
How come you can talk?

629
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,500
And what you doin' up there?

630
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,567
And if you're a scarecrow, how

631
00:23:46,567 --> 00:23:50,267
Come those crows aren't scared?

632
00:23:50,267 --> 00:23:51,800
A bevy of excellent questions

633
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,500
Which it would be my pleasure to

634
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,067
Answer if only I had a brain.

635
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,100
How can you talk without a

636
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,700
Brain?

637
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,767
I'm not sure.

638
00:23:59,767 --> 00:24:00,767
But since I been hangin' up

639
00:24:00,767 --> 00:24:01,867
Here, I've heard an awful lot of

640
00:24:01,867 --> 00:24:06,767
Brainless people talking and it

641
00:24:06,767 --> 00:24:08,967
Ain't stops them.

642
00:24:08,967 --> 00:24:10,100
So how about helping a brother

643
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:10,633
Out with some cash?

644
00:24:10,633 --> 00:24:12,267
What's it for?

645
00:24:12,267 --> 00:24:13,067
I'm saving my cents to buy me

646
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:13,767
Some sense.

647
00:24:13,767 --> 00:24:14,833
How much you got so far?

648
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,367
Nothing.

649
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:18,067
Whatever I get they take away.

650
00:24:18,067 --> 00:24:19,567
That's rent, my brother.

651
00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:22,167
All legit.

652
00:24:22,167 --> 00:24:23,267
Everything on the up and up.

653
00:24:23,267 --> 00:24:24,333
Poles don't grow on trees, you

654
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:25,933
Know.

655
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:26,900
Would you like me to help you

656
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,500
Come down from there?

657
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,067
Why he wanna come down?

658
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:30,633
My man is living penthouse high.

659
00:24:30,633 --> 00:24:32,233
Don't listen to them.

660
00:24:32,233 --> 00:24:33,300
You've got to think for

661
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,300
Yourself.

662
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:38,200
I would.

663
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,933
As soon as I get me a brain.

664
00:24:39,933 --> 00:24:40,967
But the farmer who made me

665
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:42,067
Stuffed my head with straw.

666
00:24:42,067 --> 00:24:42,700
Then these crows come along

667
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,600
Filling it with all manner of

668
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,667
Nonsense.

669
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:45,767
Ever hear such ingrateful

670
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:46,767
Platitudes?

671
00:24:46,767 --> 00:24:47,867
We fill his head with the

672
00:24:47,867 --> 00:24:49,633
Truth.

673
00:24:49,633 --> 00:24:50,967
The whole truth and nothing but

674
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:52,067
The truth.

675
00:24:52,067 --> 00:24:53,100
What kind of truth?

676
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,133
Go on.

677
00:24:54,133 --> 00:24:56,733
Elucidate the sister.

678
00:24:56,733 --> 00:24:57,800
"There ain't no gettin' ahead"

679
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,067
"For folks like me."

680
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:01,067
Gettin' a head!

681
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:03,100
That's funny, right?

682
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,767
Sit down, girl.

683
00:25:05,767 --> 00:25:09,767
School is in session.

684
00:25:09,767 --> 00:25:10,067
Go on.

685
00:25:10,067 --> 00:25:10,767
Tell her what else we taught

686
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:11,533
You.

687
00:25:11,533 --> 00:25:14,800
Represent.

688
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,067
I don't want to.

689
00:25:16,067 --> 00:25:17,100
Yeah!

690
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,133
Crow-cede with the crow

691
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:19,100
Commandments.

00:28:47,467 --> 00:28:48,100
Leave him be.

773
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,067
All of you.

774
00:28:49,067 --> 00:28:52,700
You think you scare us?

775
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,700
You listen up, I already

776
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,367
Killed a wicked witch this

777
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:56,400
Morning and I wasn't even mad at

778
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,100
Her.

779
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,833
Gotta fly.

780
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:08,133
Catch you on the b-side.

781
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:09,067
They're gone.

782
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:12,700
You can come down now.

783
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,500
Thank you.

784
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,267
I need a little help.

785
00:29:17,267 --> 00:29:18,700
Are you all right?

786
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,933
Do I look all right?

787
00:29:19,933 --> 00:29:20,933
Seem a little wobbly.

788
00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:22,067
For me, that's all right.

789
00:29:22,067 --> 00:29:23,067
You know what?

790
00:29:23,067 --> 00:29:24,633
I know nothing.

791
00:29:24,633 --> 00:29:26,200

794
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,067
He lives in the emerald city

795
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:31,467
And there's nothing he can't do.

796
00:29:31,467 --> 00:29:33,067
He's gonna get me home.

797
00:29:33,067 --> 00:29:34,100
And I bet he can get you some

798
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,133

**

844
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,933
You hear that?

845
00:31:22,933 --> 00:31:24,067
It's coming from over there.

846
00:31:24,067 --> 00:31:25,067
What should we do?

847
00:31:25,067 --> 00:31:26,100
Go over there!

848
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,167
Ohhhhhhhh!

849
00:31:27,167 --> 00:31:30,333
Someone's in trouble.

850
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:32,467
What is it?

851
00:31:32,467 --> 00:31:33,500
I have seen me some

852
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,567
Dope-fresh crock-pots in my day,

853
00:31:34,567 --> 00:31:35,600
But...

854
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,633
Shh, he's trying to say

855
00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:37,700
Something.

856
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,300
Oil.

857
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,900
What was that?

858
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,967
Oil.

859
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:44,700
I need oil.

860
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,300
He said he needs oil.

861
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:56,133
Could this be it?

862
00:31:56,133 --> 00:31:59,067
And now what?

863
00:32:02,533 --> 00:32:04,633
* slide some oil to me

864
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:07,267

865
00:32:07,267 --> 00:32:11,233

904
00:34:21,967 --> 00:34:23,067
How do I ever thank you?

905
00:34:23,067 --> 00:34:24,567
Start by saying goodbye.

906
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:26,200
C'mon, Dorothy.

907
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,233
How did you get all rusted up

908
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:28,800
Like that?

909
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:35,167
Would you mind?

910
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:37,800
I was out here fixing and

911
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,900
Tinkering and whatnot when the

912
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,500
Strangest storm come out of

913
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,100
Nowhere and before I could duck

914
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,133
For cover, I was rusted solid.

915
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:45,433
That's terrible.

916
00:34:45,433 --> 00:34:47,633
That's life.

917
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:48,900
Let's go.

918
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,200
I've gotta say, I've never

919
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,067
Met a man made out of tin

920
00:34:51,067 --> 00:34:52,067
Before.

921
00:34:52,067 --> 00:34:53,100
And you never seen a talkin'

922
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,167
Scarecrow neither.

923
00:34:54,167 --> 00:34:57,633
Just one of them days.

924
00:34:57,633 --> 00:34:58,833
Can we go now?

925
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:00,400
What's the hurry, son?

926
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,433
We got a date with the wiz.

927
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,533
He's gonna give me a brain and

928
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:03,567
Send Dorothy back home.

929
00:35:03,567 --> 00:35:04,600
He can do that?

930
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,167
He can do anything.

931
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:08,300
He's the wiz.

932
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:13,533
I wonder...

933
00:35:13,533 --> 00:35:16,067
No, he'd never...

934
00:35:16,067 --> 00:35:17,700
What?

935
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,767
Y'know, I wasn't always made

936
00:35:18,767 --> 00:35:19,833
Of tin.

937
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:20,567
Was a time I was flesh and blood

938
00:35:20,567 --> 00:35:21,400
Just like you.

939
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,967
I was even in love.

940
00:35:22,967 --> 00:35:24,067
Her name was Bertha.

941
00:35:24,067 --> 00:35:25,100
Bertha?

942
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,667
Shh!

943
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:29,300
Go on.

944
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,367
Problem was there was this

945
00:35:30,367 --> 00:35:31,433
Other girl.

946
00:35:31,433 --> 00:35:33,067
Well, not so much a girl as a

947
00:35:33,067 --> 00:35:34,600
Witch.

948
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,733
Which witch?

949
00:35:36,733 --> 00:35:37,800
Evvamean, the wicked witch of

950
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,833
The east.

951
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:39,900
You know her?

952
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,600
You could say we run into

953
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,533
Each other.

954
00:35:42,533 --> 00:35:45,167
So, what happened?

955
00:35:45,167 --> 00:35:47,267
I swear I never encouraged

956
00:35:47,267 --> 00:35:48,333
Her but evvamean was sweet on

957
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:49,900
Me.

958
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,967
Made no never mind, my heart

959
00:35:50,967 --> 00:35:53,067
Belonged to Bertha.

960
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,233
I know I should've manned up and

961
00:35:55,233 --> 00:35:56,767
Told her, but before I could,

962
00:35:56,767 --> 00:35:57,833
Old evvamean caught us kissing

963
00:35:57,833 --> 00:36:00,533
In the woods.

964
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,533
She let loose a bolt of

965
00:36:01,533 --> 00:36:02,600
Lightning knocked me clear

966
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,200
Across the river.

967
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,867
When I opened my eyes I was like

968
00:36:07,867 --> 00:36:15,067
This, ice cold and steely hard.

969
00:36:15,067 --> 00:36:16,767
Bertha said she didn't mind, but

970
00:36:16,767 --> 00:36:17,833
Turning me to tin wasn't the

971
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:20,967
Worst thing evvamean done to me.

972
00:36:20,967 --> 00:36:22,600
She said if she couldn't have my

973
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,233
Heart, then no one could.

974
00:36:25,233 --> 00:36:27,900
Without a heart I had to let

975
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,967
Bertha go.

976
00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:31,067
That is the saddest story I

977
00:36:31,067 --> 00:36:33,133
Ever heard.

978
00:36:33,133 --> 00:36:34,733
Come on, Dorothy.

979
00:36:34,733 --> 00:36:36,300
See you later.

980
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,067
You don't suppose the wiz...

981
00:36:37,067 --> 00:36:38,433
Well, of course he can give

982
00:36:38,433 --> 00:36:39,733
You back your heart.

983
00:36:39,733 --> 00:36:41,567
You really think so?

984
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:43,167
I don't.

985
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:44,233
But then again, I don't got a

986
00:36:44,233 --> 00:36:45,233
Brain.

987
00:36:45,233 --> 00:36:46,333
You come with us to emerald

988
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:47,367
City.

989
00:36:47,367 --> 00:36:48,433
When the wiz hears your story he

990
00:36:48,433 --> 00:36:51,600
Will never turn you away.

991
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,867
No.

992
00:36:54,867 --> 00:36:55,400
I can't go with you.

993
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,333
Old evvamean still keeps watch

994
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:57,433
To be sure I'm never happy.

995
00:36:57,433 --> 00:36:58,967
They don't call her ever-mean

996
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:01,100
For nothing.

997
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:01,833
Traveling with me would put you

998
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:03,200
Both in danger.

999
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,167
But thank you.

1000
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:06,900
Thank you kindly.

1001
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,933
Actually, I guess you been

1002
00:37:07,933 --> 00:37:09,067
Rusted up so you haven't heard.

1003
00:37:09,067 --> 00:37:10,100
Evvamean is no longer of this

1004
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:15,133
World.

1005
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:15,733
See,

1006
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,267
What had had happened was

1007
00:37:17,267 --> 00:37:21,867
Somebody sort of accidentally

1008
00:37:21,867 --> 00:37:23,467
Dropped a house on her.

1009
00:37:23,467 --> 00:37:29,300
Come again, say what now?

1010
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,133
Those are evvamean's shoes.

1011
00:37:32,133 --> 00:37:33,133
It was you?

1012
00:37:33,133 --> 00:37:34,233
You dropped a house on evvamean?

1013
00:37:34,233 --> 00:37:35,300
I wasn't aiming or nothing.

1014
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,333
But, yeah, it was my house.

1015
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:40,067
Thank you.

1016
00:37:40,067 --> 00:37:41,367
So how's about coming with

1017
00:37:41,367 --> 00:37:42,133
Us?

1018
00:37:42,133 --> 00:37:44,233
You mean it?

1019
00:37:44,233 --> 00:37:45,867
Could my nightmare finally be

1020
00:37:45,867 --> 00:37:46,900
Over?

1021
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,467
Why not?

1022
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:52,700
Just show me the way!

1023
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,067
* pick your right foot up

1024
00:37:55,067 --> 00:37:56,900
When your left one's down *

1025
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,067
* come on, legs keep movin'

1026
00:37:59,067 --> 00:38:01,133
Don't you lose no ground *

1027
00:38:01,133 --> 00:38:03,167
* 'cause the road you're walkin'

1028
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:05,833
Might be long sometime *

1029
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:07,433
* but just stick with me

1030
00:38:07,433 --> 00:38:09,533
And you'll be just fine *

1031
00:38:09,533 --> 00:38:10,600
* come on and, ease on down

1032
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,700
Ease on down the road *

1033
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,767
* come on and, ease on down

1034
00:38:14,767 --> 00:38:17,467
Ease on down the road *

1035
00:38:17,467 --> 00:38:19,600
* don't you carry nothin'

1036
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,133
That might be a load

1037
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:21,667
Come on and *

1038
00:38:21,667 --> 00:38:23,767
* ease on down, ease on down

1039
00:38:23,767 --> 00:38:25,367
Ease on down, ease on down *

1040
00:38:25,367 --> 00:38:26,400
* ease on down, ease on down

1041
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:34,833
The **

1042
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:35,867
* ah ah ah ah

1043
00:38:35,867 --> 00:38:37,467
Say what you wanna

1044
00:38:37,467 --> 00:38:39,067
But I'm here to stay

1045
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:42,233
'Cause I'm a mean ole lion *

1046
00:38:42,233 --> 00:38:43,800
* you can go where you wanna

1047
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,667
But don't get in my way

1048
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:50,133
'Cause I'm a mean ole lion

1049
00:38:50,133 --> 00:38:53,300
You'll be standin' in a draft *

1050
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:57,533
* if you don't hear me laugh

1051
00:38:57,533 --> 00:38:59,067
And if you happen

1052
00:38:59,067 --> 00:39:01,200
To come around *

1053
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,800
* better hope that

1054
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,900
I don't frown

1055
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,933
'Cause I just might

1056
00:39:05,933 --> 00:39:08,633
Knock you down *

1057
00:39:08,633 --> 00:39:16,467
* 'cause I'm a mean ole lion

1058
00:39:16,467 --> 00:39:18,167
I'm a mean old lion

1059
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:19,300
Don't you know

1060
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,867
I'm ready to fight *

1061
00:39:20,867 --> 00:39:21,867
* I'll turn your day into night

1062
00:39:21,867 --> 00:39:22,967
'Cause I'm a mean ole lion

1063
00:39:22,967 --> 00:39:24,533
And if you're half bright

1064
00:39:24,533 --> 00:39:26,700
You'll detour to the right *

1065
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,867
* 'cause I'm a mean ole lion

1066
00:39:30,867 --> 00:39:32,467
All you strangers better beware

This is the

1068
00:39:34,567 --> 00:39:38,767
King of the jungle here *

1069
00:39:38,767 --> 00:39:39,833

1070
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:41,967
To let you slide

1071
00:39:41,967 --> 00:39:43,533
Don't just stand there

1072
00:39:43,533 --> 00:39:46,167
Run and hide *

1073
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:47,467
* now, you just caught

1074
00:39:47,467 --> 00:39:49,333
My better side *

* 'cause I'm a mean ole lion

00:39:53,067 --> 00:39:56,200
I'm a mean ole lion

A mean ole lion *

1078
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:02,000
Ow.

1079
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,033
You hit me.

1080
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:04,633
You dig that?

1081
00:40:04,633 --> 00:40:06,533
Don't you know you could do

1082
00:40:06,533 --> 00:40:07,800
Permanent damage that way?

1083
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,867
And you call yourself king of

1084
00:40:08,867 --> 00:40:09,900
The jungle?

1085
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,933
You see another cat begging

1086
00:40:10,933 --> 00:40:11,933
For the gig?

1087
00:40:11,933 --> 00:40:13,700
Man, you've got a yellow

1088
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,233
Streak a mile wide.

1089
00:40:14,233 --> 00:40:16,200
Do not.

1090
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,967
I had it touched up last

1091
00:40:17,967 --> 00:40:19,933
Thursday.

1092
00:40:19,933 --> 00:40:20,633
You ought'a be ashamed of

1093
00:40:20,633 --> 00:40:21,367
Yourself, going around roaring

1094
00:40:21,367 --> 00:40:21,733
At folks.

1095
00:40:21,733 --> 00:40:23,067
You're nothing but a great big

1096
00:40:23,067 --> 00:40:24,100
Coward.

1097
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,167
Hey.

1098
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:26,200
You don't gotta scream it for

1099
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,800
The whole neighborhood.

1100
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,867
I've got to represent here, you

1101
00:40:28,867 --> 00:40:29,900
Know?

1102
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,967
Don't want all the little forest

1103
00:40:30,967 --> 00:40:32,033
Creatures getting wise and

1104
00:40:32,033 --> 00:40:33,100
Ganging up on me.

1105
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,200
Oh, what's the use?

1106
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,267
I'll never be nothing but a big

1107
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:40,267
Ole scaredy-cat.

1108
00:40:40,267 --> 00:40:42,800
That's all I'm ever going to be.

1109
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,867
I tried to get help from this

1110
00:40:43,867 --> 00:40:44,933
Old owl.

1111
00:40:44,933 --> 00:40:45,967
But he just makes me lie on his

1112
00:40:45,967 --> 00:40:47,033
Couch while he asks a lot of

1113
00:40:47,033 --> 00:40:48,167
Stupid questions...

1114
00:40:48,167 --> 00:40:49,100
How do you feel?

1115
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:49,633
What do you want?

1116
00:40:49,633 --> 00:40:50,667
What do you think it means?

1117
00:40:50,667 --> 00:40:52,267
I told him, "I think it means"

1118
00:40:52,267 --> 00:40:53,333
That I'm getting ripped off,

1119
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:54,367
'Cause you take all my money and

1120
00:40:54,367 --> 00:40:55,433
"Give me nothing."

1121
00:40:55,433 --> 00:40:56,500
Oh, you poor thing.

1122
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,033
Oh, great.

1123
00:40:57,033 --> 00:40:58,067
Now I've got little girls

1124
00:40:58,067 --> 00:40:59,667
Pitying me.

1125
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:01,767
It could be worse.

1126
00:41:01,767 --> 00:41:03,067
At least this forest is a nice

1127
00:41:03,067 --> 00:41:05,467
Home.

1128
00:41:05,467 --> 00:41:06,533
And you've still got your

1129
00:41:06,533 --> 00:41:07,567
Heart.

1130
00:41:07,567 --> 00:41:08,633
And a brain.

1131
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,233
What good's all that if I

1132
00:41:10,233 --> 00:41:11,300
Ain't got the courage to get out

1133
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,967
Of bed?

1134
00:41:14,967 --> 00:41:16,533
Maybe, just maybe, if you

1135
00:41:16,533 --> 00:41:17,600
Came with us to see the wiz, he

1136
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,700
Might be able to give you

1137
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,767
Courage.

1138
00:41:19,767 --> 00:41:20,767
Really?

1139
00:41:20,767 --> 00:41:22,400
Just like that?

1140
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,600
I don't see why not.

1141
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,333
He's going to give scarecrow a

1142
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:25,533
Brain, and tinman a heart and

1143
00:41:25,533 --> 00:41:30,300
Get me home.

1144
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,933
* come on and ease on down

1145
00:41:31,933 --> 00:41:32,933
Ease on down the road

1146
00:41:32,933 --> 00:41:34,067
Come on and ease on down

1147
00:41:34,067 --> 00:41:38,733
Ease on down the road *

1148
00:41:38,733 --> 00:41:42,533
* don't you carry nothing

1149
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:47,067
That might be a load

1150
00:41:47,067 --> 00:41:48,500
Come on and ease on down

1151
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,567
Ease on down the road *

1152
00:41:49,567 --> 00:41:50,567
* 'cause there may be times

1153
00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:52,200
When you wish you wasn't born

1154
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,067
And you wake one morning

1155
00:41:54,067 --> 00:41:57,400
Just to find your courage gone *

1156
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,133
* but just know that feeling

1157
00:41:58,133 --> 00:42:00,100
Only last a little while

1158
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,200
You just stick with me

1159
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,767
And I 'll show you how to

1160
00:42:02,767 --> 00:42:03,833
Smile *

1161
00:42:03,833 --> 00:42:07,533
* come on, ease on down

1162
00:42:07,533 --> 00:42:11,633
Ease on down the road

00:42:11,633 --> 00:42:12,767
Come on and ease on down

1164
00:42:12,767 --> 00:42:14,633
Ease on down the road *

1165
00:42:14,633 --> 00:42:15,400
* don't you carry nothing

1166
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,433
That might be a load

1167

Come on and *

1168
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,833

Ease on down, ease on down

1173
00:42:25,433 --> 00:42:28,200
The road *

1174
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,567
* where'd the road go?

1175
00:42:42,567 --> 00:42:44,200
Come on and, ease on down

1176
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,767
Ease on down the road *

1177
00:42:46,767 --> 00:42:48,400
* come on and, ease on down

1178
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,300
Ease on down the road *

1179
00:42:50,533 --> 00:42:51,567
Where'd the road go?

1180
00:42:51,567 --> 00:42:52,633
Where'd the what what?

1181
00:42:52,633 --> 00:42:53,667
Anybody seen the yellow brick

1182
00:42:53,667 --> 00:42:54,767
Road?

1183
00:42:54,767 --> 00:42:55,733
We were just on it.

1184
00:42:55,733 --> 00:42:56,833
And now we're not.

1185
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:57,867
It's gotta be here.

1186
00:42:57,867 --> 00:42:58,933
Roads don't get up and walk

1187
00:42:58,933 --> 00:43:00,067
Away.

1188
00:43:00,067 --> 00:43:01,067
Maybe not where you come

1189
00:43:01,067 --> 00:43:02,133
From.

1190
00:43:02,133 --> 00:43:03,167
Anybody else notice how dark

1191
00:43:03,167 --> 00:43:04,233
It's getting?

1192
00:43:04,233 --> 00:43:05,300
What was that?

1193
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,333
What was what?

1194
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:07,367
I thought I heard...

1195
00:43:07,367 --> 00:43:08,433
Don't get all hysterical now.

1196
00:43:08,433 --> 00:43:10,067
I'm not getting hysterical

1197
00:43:10,067 --> 00:43:11,100
Now.

1198
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,133
But gimme a few minutes?

1199
00:43:12,133 --> 00:43:13,700
If we're going to get to the

1200
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,400
Emerald city, we've got to find

1201
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:15,833
That road.

1202
00:43:15,833 --> 00:43:18,467
How about this?

1203
00:43:18,467 --> 00:43:19,167
There's four directions, and

1204
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,733
There are four of us.

1205
00:43:19,733 --> 00:43:20,367
We'll each go a different

1206
00:43:20,367 --> 00:43:21,100
Direction and, between us, we'll

1207
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,133
Find the yellow brick road.

1208
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:23,167
Good plan.

1209
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:24,233
Yeah, good plan.

1210
00:43:24,233 --> 00:43:25,300
Can I go with you?

1211
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,333
Snap to, Leroy!

1212
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:27,933
You're embarrassing yourself.

1213
00:43:27,933 --> 00:43:31,967
Now, let's move out!

1214
00:43:33,733 --> 00:43:35,833
Dorothy.

1215
00:43:35,833 --> 00:43:37,400
Dorothy.

1216
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,067
Who's that?

1217
00:43:40,067 --> 00:43:41,100
Scarecrow?

1218
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,167
Dorothy, help me, baby.

1219
00:43:42,167 --> 00:43:43,200
Aunt em?

1220
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,300
That you?

1221
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,333
It's me, baby.

1222
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:46,933
Don't you recognize your own

1223
00:43:46,933 --> 00:43:48,800
Mama?

1224
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,433
Mama?

1225
00:43:51,433 --> 00:43:52,233
Yes, baby.

1226
00:43:52,233 --> 00:43:53,800
It can't be.

1227
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,167
You're...

1228
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:59,067
I'm right here, baby.

1229
00:43:59,067 --> 00:44:00,633
Mama, I miss you so much.

1230
00:44:00,633 --> 00:44:01,700
I've been trying to get home to

1231
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,767
You.

1232
00:44:02,767 --> 00:44:03,800
And I'm trying to get to you,

1233
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,833
Baby.

1234
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:06,967
I wanna hold you so bad.

1235
00:44:06,967 --> 00:44:08,567
But I can't get down from here.

1236
00:44:08,567 --> 00:44:09,633
I'll climb up and get you.

1237
00:44:09,633 --> 00:44:10,667
No!

1238
00:44:10,667 --> 00:44:12,233
Stay where you are or you'll be

1239
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:13,300
Stuck here, too.

1240
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,967
But how can I get you down?

1241
00:44:15,967 --> 00:44:19,367
Those shoes.

1242
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:20,133
Shoes?

1243
00:44:20,133 --> 00:44:24,833
Them silver slippers.

1244
00:44:24,833 --> 00:44:26,300
They're magic.

1245
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,600
They'll get me down.

1246
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,733
Pass 'em to me.

1247
00:44:28,733 --> 00:44:29,133
But i...

1248
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:30,067
Come on, baby girl.

1249
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:31,900

Don't matter what you

1254
00:44:37,733 --> 00:44:38,333
Promised that old witch.

1255
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:38,933
You listen to your mama.

1256
00:44:38,933 --> 00:44:40,533
Hand me them slippers.

1257
00:44:40,533 --> 00:44:41,567
Please, baby, please.

1258
00:44:41,567 --> 00:44:43,667
Come on, stretch a little bit

1259
00:44:43,667 --> 00:44:44,767
More.

1260
00:44:44,767 --> 00:44:46,333
Dorothy, no!

1261
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:47,233
It's the kalidahs!

1262
00:44:52,433 --> 00:45:03,467

1267
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,767
Thank you, tinman.

1268
00:45:37,767 --> 00:45:39,367
If you hadn't come back when you

1269
00:45:39,367 --> 00:45:40,933
Did...

1270
00:45:40,933 --> 00:45:41,633
I will mollywhop the fool

1271
00:45:41,633 --> 00:45:42,533
Tries to step to you!

1272
00:45:42,533 --> 00:45:44,133
And scarecrow, you really

1273
00:45:44,133 --> 00:45:46,467
Surprised me.

1274
00:45:46,467 --> 00:45:47,833
Weren't no big thing.

1275
00:45:47,833 --> 00:45:49,933
And you, lion...

1276
00:45:49,933 --> 00:45:52,067
Can't wait to hear what she

1277
00:45:52,067 --> 00:45:53,633
Got to say to that quivering,

1278
00:45:53,633 --> 00:45:55,200
Cowering mess.

1279
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,267
Wasn't my fault.

1280
00:45:56,267 --> 00:45:57,333
I had a furball.

1281
00:45:57,333 --> 00:45:58,900
That's exactly what you

1282
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,067
Are... a great big furball.

1283
00:46:00,067 --> 00:46:01,533
Stop.

1284
00:46:01,533 --> 00:46:02,600
I saw him knock down one of

1285
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,967
Those things.

1286
00:46:04,967 --> 00:46:05,767
Knock down?

1287
00:46:05,767 --> 00:46:06,833
It tripped on his tail.

1288
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:07,867
He could've run away, but he

1289
00:46:07,867 --> 00:46:08,933
Didn't.

1290
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:09,967
He stood tall.

1291
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:12,100
'Till he played dead.

1292
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:15,067
He's right.

1293
00:46:15,067 --> 00:46:15,800
Y'all should just go on without

1294
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,900
Me.

1295
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,500
Ain't no wiz powerful enough to

1296
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:26,200
Fix this mess.

1297
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,500
* woo woo woo woo

1298
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:35,233
There is a place we'll go

1299
00:46:35,233 --> 00:46:41,067
Where there is mostly quiet *

1300
00:46:41,067 --> 00:46:46,300
* flowers and butterflies

1301
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:55,267
A rainbow lives beside it

1302
00:46:55,267 --> 00:46:59,500
And from a velvet sky

1303
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:06,367
A summer storm *

1304
00:47:06,367 --> 00:47:09,500
* you can feel

1305
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:14,233
The coolness in the air

1306
00:47:14,233 --> 00:47:24,800
But you're still warm *

1307
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:31,167
* and then a mighty roar

1308
00:47:31,167 --> 00:47:39,067
Will start the sky to crying

1309
00:47:39,067 --> 00:47:44,333
Not even lightning

1310
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:53,300
Will be frightening my lion *

1311
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:59,100
* and with no fear inside

1312
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:02,767
No need to run

1313
00:48:02,767 --> 00:48:05,933
No need to hide *

1314
00:48:05,933 --> 00:48:09,633
* you're standing

1315
00:48:09,633 --> 00:48:14,900
Strong and tall

1316
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:21,200
You're the bravest of them all

1317
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,433
If on courage you must call *

1318
00:48:25,433 --> 00:48:29,100
* then keep on trying

1319
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:31,233
And trying

1320
00:48:31,233 --> 00:48:35,433
And trying *

1321
00:48:35,433 --> 00:48:42,267
* you're a lion

1322
00:48:42,267 --> 00:48:52,800
In your own way, be a lion *

1323
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,500
* I'm standing strong and tall

Of them all

Be a lion *

1333
00:49:37,067 --> 00:49:38,500
Yes, you are.

00:50:00,767 --> 00:50:02,333
Dorothy, look.

1338
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:02,867
Isn't that...

1339
00:50:02,867 --> 00:50:03,933
It has to be.

1340
00:50:03,933 --> 00:50:05,500
What else could it be

1341
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:06,000
Except...

1342
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,100
The emerald city!

1343
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,133
I've never seen anything so

1344
00:50:08,133 --> 00:50:09,233
Beautiful.

1345
00:50:09,233 --> 00:50:10,267
Well, what are we waiting

1346
00:50:10,267 --> 00:50:11,800
For?

1347
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,367
Let's go!

1348
00:50:16,067 --> 00:50:20,800
**

1349
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,433
What are these?

1350
00:50:22,433 --> 00:50:23,500
Nothing but flowers.

1351
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,100
No, they're the poppies I was

1352
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,167
Warned about.

1353
00:50:27,167 --> 00:50:30,233
What do they want?

1354
00:50:30,233 --> 00:50:30,833
I'd say they want us.

1355
00:50:30,833 --> 00:50:31,933
Don't let them get hold of

1356
00:50:31,933 --> 00:50:32,967
You.

1357
00:50:32,967 --> 00:50:34,033
Who's she?

1358
00:50:34,033 --> 00:50:35,633
Isn't she beautiful?

1359
00:50:35,633 --> 00:50:38,233
No, stay back.

1360
00:50:38,233 --> 00:50:39,300
You can't let them touch you.

1361
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,367
The munchkins said they're

1362
00:50:40,367 --> 00:50:41,433
Dangerous.

1363
00:50:41,433 --> 00:50:42,467
Like poison Ivy?

1364
00:50:42,467 --> 00:50:44,333
Oh, they are worse than that.

1365
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:45,133
What are they up to?

1366
00:50:45,133 --> 00:50:46,167
They're up to no good.

1367
00:50:46,167 --> 00:50:47,233
What do you suppose they want

1368
00:50:47,233 --> 00:50:48,267
With us?

1369
00:50:48,267 --> 00:50:49,333
I know exactly what they

1370
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:50,400
Want, and it ain't happening.

1371
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,467
The munchkins said that once

1372
00:50:51,467 --> 00:50:52,500
They get a hold of you they

1373
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,567
Never let go.

1374
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,600
And that's a bad thing?

1375
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,667
It's not a good one.

1376
00:50:55,667 --> 00:50:57,233
This here's my corner of the

1377
00:50:57,233 --> 00:51:00,067
Forest.

1378
00:51:00,067 --> 00:51:01,200
Y'all need to

1379
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,267
Stand back and let a lion do

1380
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:02,867
What a lion's got to do.

1381
00:51:02,867 --> 00:51:03,833
Ladies, would any of you care to

1382
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:05,367
Dance?

1383
00:51:05,367 --> 00:51:06,867
No, lion, don't!

1384
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:20,133
**

1385
00:51:20,133 --> 00:51:34,100
**

1386
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:45,200
**

1387
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:57,167
**

1388
00:51:57,167 --> 00:52:06,800
**

1389
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,900
Ladies, thank you for that

1390
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,200
Lovely dance.

1391
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:09,900
We must do it again some time.

1392
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:10,533
And booya!

1393
00:52:10,533 --> 00:52:11,600
That's my lion.

1394
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,633
Give me some paw, my man.

1395
00:52:12,633 --> 00:52:14,700
Good job.

1396
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:18,567
And now, I believe we have a

1397
00:52:18,567 --> 00:52:20,800
Meeting with the wiz, yes?

1398
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,767
**

1399
00:52:36,767 --> 00:52:37,867
And we have arrived!

1400
00:52:37,867 --> 00:52:41,300
The emerald city.

1401
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:48,067
Ain't this something?

1402
00:52:48,067 --> 00:52:48,267
>>

1403
00:52:48,267 --> 00:52:49,667
End of the line, dawg!

1404
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:50,400
You can't be pushin' your way to

1405
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,233
The front.

1406
00:52:51,233 --> 00:52:52,267
Go on.

1407
00:52:52,267 --> 00:52:53,333
Get yourself to the end of the

1408
00:52:53,333 --> 00:52:54,367
Line!

1409
00:52:54,367 --> 00:52:55,533
There's no one else here.

1410
00:52:55,533 --> 00:52:56,500
You saying you're too good to

1411
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,533
Get in line?

1412
00:52:57,533 --> 00:52:58,600
No, but...

1413
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,633
What?

1414
00:52:59,633 --> 00:53:00,733
You something special, some

1415
00:53:00,733 --> 00:53:01,733
Kind'a vip or whatnot?

1416
00:53:01,733 --> 00:53:03,467
I'm not tryin'...

1417
00:53:03,467 --> 00:53:04,400
And you ain't cuttin' the

1418
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,467
Line neither!

1419
00:53:05,467 --> 00:53:07,067
Now step to the end of the line!

1420
00:53:07,067 --> 00:53:08,100
Hello.

1421
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,167
May I help you?

1422
00:53:09,167 --> 00:53:10,167
We'd like to go inside,

1423
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:11,800
Please.

1424
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,367
Name?

1425
00:53:13,367 --> 00:53:14,433
I'm Dorothy, and this is

1426
00:53:14,433 --> 00:53:15,167
Tinman, and scarecrow and lion.

1427
00:53:15,167 --> 00:53:16,067
Sorry.

1428
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:17,067
Not on the list.

1429
00:53:17,067 --> 00:53:18,133
Move along.

1430
00:53:18,133 --> 00:53:19,200
But we've got to get inside.

1431
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,067
And when did that become my

1432
00:53:21,067 --> 00:53:24,500
Problem?

1433
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,233
Either your name's on my list or

1434
00:53:25,233 --> 00:53:25,600
It's not.

1435
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,733
Now adios, amigos.

1436
00:53:28,733 --> 00:53:29,933
Excuse me, my brother.

1437
00:53:29,933 --> 00:53:30,900
That's a lady you're talking to.

1438
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:31,967
And what are you gonna do

1439
00:53:31,967 --> 00:53:33,067
About it?

1440
00:53:33,067 --> 00:53:33,700
I was just makin' sure you

1441
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:34,600
Knew she was a lady.

1442
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,200
Peace out.

1443
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,767
Look here, we've come on very

1444
00:53:37,767 --> 00:53:38,833
Important business.

1445
00:53:38,833 --> 00:53:39,833
There must be some way for us to

1446
00:53:39,833 --> 00:53:41,433
Get inside.

1447
00:53:41,433 --> 00:53:43,067
Oh, there's several ways.

1448
00:53:43,067 --> 00:53:44,100
Your name could be on the list.

1449
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,667
You could be famous.

1450
00:53:45,667 --> 00:53:46,733
You could grease my palm with a

1451
00:53:46,733 --> 00:53:48,333
Sizable donation to my

1452
00:53:48,333 --> 00:53:49,533
Retirement fund...

1453
00:53:49,533 --> 00:53:50,967
Or you could be connected, know

1454
00:53:50,967 --> 00:53:58,667
Somebody important.

1455
00:53:58,667 --> 00:53:59,200
I know addaperle.

1456
00:53:59,200 --> 00:53:59,900
Come on, you don't know no

1457
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:00,267
Addaperle.

1458
00:54:00,267 --> 00:54:00,867
I most certainly do.

1459
00:54:00,867 --> 00:54:02,567
In fact, after I killed the

1460
00:54:02,567 --> 00:54:03,633
Wicked witch of the east, she's

1461
00:54:03,633 --> 00:54:09,667
The one who gave me these

1462
00:54:09,667 --> 00:54:11,867
Magical, enchanted slippers.

1463
00:54:11,867 --> 00:54:12,900
Excuse me, but did you just

1464
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:13,933
Say addaperle?

1465
00:54:13,933 --> 00:54:15,067
Wicked witch?

1466
00:54:15,067 --> 00:54:16,067
And enchanted slippers?

1467
00:54:16,067 --> 00:54:18,267
Girl, you hit the trifecta!

1468
00:54:18,267 --> 00:54:21,867
Welcome to the emerald city!

1469
00:54:21,867 --> 00:54:28,200
**

1470
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:39,267
**

1471
00:54:39,267 --> 00:54:52,333
**

1472
00:54:52,333 --> 00:55:06,733
**

1473
00:55:06,733 --> 00:55:11,067
**

1474
00:55:11,067 --> 00:55:12,100
Did you ever imagine anything

1475
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,700
Like this?

1476
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:14,733
Excuse me.

1477
00:55:14,733 --> 00:55:15,567
Can you tell me where to find

1478
00:55:15,567 --> 00:55:16,300
The wiz?

1479
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:17,367
What did you say?

1480
00:55:17,367 --> 00:55:18,433
The wiz.

1481
00:55:18,433 --> 00:55:19,500
He lives around here, right?

1482
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,133
What'd she say?

1483
00:55:21,133 --> 00:55:22,133
If I didn't know better, I'd

1484
00:55:22,133 --> 00:55:23,200
Say she asked where to find the

1485
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,400
Wiz.

1486
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,067
Why the shade?

1487
00:55:29,067 --> 00:55:30,567
The young lady asked a perfectly

1488
00:55:30,567 --> 00:55:51,500
Normal question.

1489
00:55:51,500 --> 00:56:00,067
**

1490
00:56:00,067 --> 00:56:01,067
I don't know what none of

1491
00:56:01,067 --> 00:56:02,133
That means.

1492
00:56:02,133 --> 00:56:06,167
Excuse me, brother.

1493
00:56:06,167 --> 00:56:08,433
We just came...

1494
00:56:08,433 --> 00:56:10,367
We need the wiz.

1495
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:19,500
Oh, my.

1496
00:56:20,267 --> 00:56:25,100
**

1497
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:26,133
T'ain't nothin' normal about

1498
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:26,733
Wantin' to see the wiz.

1499
00:56:26,733 --> 00:56:27,733
Nobody sees the wiz.

1500
00:56:27,733 --> 00:56:28,267
Not nobody.

1501
00:56:28,267 --> 00:56:29,733
They say he's terrible to

1502
00:56:29,733 --> 00:56:30,800
Behold.

1503
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:31,467
He's got the head of a

1504
00:56:31,467 --> 00:56:32,067
Fire-breathing dragon.

1505
00:56:32,067 --> 00:56:33,067
And the overpowering body of

1506
00:56:33,067 --> 00:56:33,533
An elephant.

1507
00:56:33,533 --> 00:56:34,633
With wings!

1508
00:56:34,633 --> 00:56:35,667
And razor sharp claws that

1509
00:56:35,667 --> 00:56:36,733
Can shred a man like tissue

1510
00:56:36,733 --> 00:56:37,233
Paper!

1511
00:56:37,233 --> 00:56:38,800
I'd hate to imagine what

1512
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:39,867
They'd do to a little girl.

1513
00:56:39,867 --> 00:56:40,933
Heard enough.

1514
00:56:40,933 --> 00:56:43,067
Who wants to catch a movie

1515
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:44,100
Before we split town?

1516
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:44,833
I hope they don't put butter on

1517
00:56:44,833 --> 00:56:45,667
Their popcorn.

1518
00:56:45,667 --> 00:56:49,400
I've gotta watch my cholesterol.

1519
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,433
But you've never seen him

1520
00:56:50,433 --> 00:56:51,500
Yourself?

1521
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,067
Nobody has.

1522
00:56:52,067 --> 00:56:53,067
Not never.

1523
00:56:53,067 --> 00:56:54,100
He's been locked inside that

1524
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:54,800
Throne room since he got here.

1525
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,700
Believe me, miss, you don't

1526
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:57,267
Want to go in there.

1527
00:56:57,267 --> 00:56:59,400
But we've traveled such a...

1528
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,433
You don't want to go in

1529
00:57:00,433 --> 00:57:03,633
There!

1530
00:57:03,633 --> 00:57:05,167
But unless we see him we...

1531
00:57:05,167 --> 00:57:06,233
You don't want to go in

1532
00:57:06,233 --> 00:57:09,567
There!

1533
00:57:09,567 --> 00:57:11,067
Yes, we do!

1534
00:57:11,067 --> 00:57:16,833
Don't we?

1535
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:18,600
We don't want to go in there.

1536
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:19,633
See that right there?

1537
00:57:19,633 --> 00:57:20,700
It's a door.

1538
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,267
Just a door.

1539
00:57:22,267 --> 00:57:23,333
But on the other side of that

1540
00:57:23,333 --> 00:57:24,067
Door is everything you've ever

1541
00:57:24,067 --> 00:57:24,900
Wanted.

1542
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:25,967
So, are we going through that

1543
00:57:25,967 --> 00:57:28,067
Door or not?

1544
00:57:28,067 --> 00:57:29,667
[Screams]

1545
00:57:29,667 --> 00:57:31,467
Ah!

1546
00:57:31,467 --> 00:57:31,867
Look!

1547
00:57:31,867 --> 00:57:32,300
Look there!

1548
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:33,700
Are those?

1549
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,400
They couldn't be.

1550
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,567
Could they?

1551
00:57:36,567 --> 00:57:37,300
Pardon, miss, but would you

1552
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,067
Mind telling me where you got

1553
00:57:38,067 --> 00:57:40,200
Them shiny shoes?

1554
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,367
Oh, these old things?

1555
00:57:43,367 --> 00:57:45,467
Addaperle laid them on me after

1556
00:57:45,467 --> 00:57:47,600
I dropped a house on evvamean.

1557
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:48,633
After you...

1558
00:57:48,633 --> 00:57:49,933
My bad.

1559
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:53,433
Go on, miss.

1560
00:57:53,433 --> 00:57:55,100
The door ain't locked.

1561
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:56,167
And do give the wiz my best

1562
00:57:56,167 --> 00:57:57,200
Regards.

1563
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,700
Ooh, snap!

1564
00:58:16,967 --> 00:58:18,100
Well, go on.

1565
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,167
Why I gotta go on?

1566
00:58:19,167 --> 00:58:20,200
You're the only one of us

1567
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,267
Wearin' armor.

1568
00:58:21,267 --> 00:58:27,067
We'll all go together.

1569
00:58:27,067 --> 00:58:28,633
You!

1570
00:58:28,633 --> 00:58:29,667
Stop right where you are!

1571
00:58:29,667 --> 00:58:32,967
I'm stopped.

1572
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:34,700
I am stopped.

1573
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:36,233
Don't gotta tell me twice.

1574
00:58:36,233 --> 00:58:37,333
Who dares disturb my

1575
00:58:37,333 --> 00:58:38,333
Meditations?

1576
00:58:38,333 --> 00:58:40,567
The man asked a question.

1577
00:58:40,567 --> 00:58:42,300
Answer.

1578
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:43,900
I'm sorry if we disturbed

1579
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:44,933
You, but we just want to meet

1580
00:58:44,933 --> 00:58:46,533
The wiz.

1581
00:58:46,533 --> 00:58:48,767
You want to meet the wiz?

1582
00:58:48,767 --> 00:58:50,233
Yes, sir.

1583
00:58:50,233 --> 00:58:51,467
If it wouldn't be too much

1584
00:58:51,467 --> 00:58:53,633
Trouble.

1585
00:58:53,633 --> 00:58:54,700
Child, you don't know what

1586
00:58:54,700 --> 00:59:12,900
Trouble is!

1587
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,500
* so you wanted to meet? The

1588
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:19,233
Wizard

1589
00:59:19,233 --> 00:59:20,833
Let me tell you that you've come

1590
00:59:20,833 --> 00:59:21,867
To the right place *

1591
00:59:21,867 --> 00:59:22,900
* shall I make you a frog or

1592
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:27,167
Lizard?

1593
00:59:27,167 --> 00:59:28,733
You should see the strange

1594
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:30,300
Expression on your face *

1595
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,967
* if the way I come on is

1596
00:59:32,967 --> 00:59:35,600
Frightening

1597
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,167
That's the way I felt like

1598
00:59:37,167 --> 00:59:38,233
Coming on today *

1599
00:59:38,233 --> 00:59:39,267
* have you ever been kissed by

1600
00:59:39,267 --> 00:59:44,067
Lightning?

1601
00:59:44,067 --> 00:59:45,633
Let me tell you

1602
00:59:45,633 --> 00:59:49,333
That will make you go away *

1603
00:59:49,333 --> 00:59:50,333
* I fly, and the magic of my

1604
00:59:50,333 --> 00:59:51,933
Power

1605
00:59:51,933 --> 00:59:54,067
Takes me higher *

1606
00:59:54,067 --> 00:59:55,633
* to a level where the clouds

1607
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:58,300
Turn into fire *

1608
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,867
* in the warmness of the fire

1609
00:59:59,867 --> 01:00:05,667
I feel fine *

1610
01:00:05,667 --> 01:00:07,267
* just keep your eyes open

1611
01:00:07,267 --> 01:00:09,367
And the magic you will see *

1612
01:00:09,367 --> 01:00:10,967
* it will whistle on the wind

1613
01:00:10,967 --> 01:00:13,000
As it emanates from me *

1614
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,100
* it's a strong and true

1615
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:15,667
Vibration

1616
01:00:15,667 --> 01:00:19,900
You can feel it on your skin *

1617
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:20,967
Now come and take my hand

1618
01:00:20,967 --> 01:00:22,567
And we will dance upon the

1619
01:00:22,567 --> 01:00:36,200
Wind *

1620
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,767
* so you wanted to meet the

1621
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:45,667
Wizard *

1622
01:00:45,667 --> 01:00:48,300
**

1623
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:49,367
Is it over?

1624
01:00:49,367 --> 01:00:51,500
Can I open my eyes?

1625
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,533
They are open.

1626
01:00:52,533 --> 01:00:53,600
Oh, no.

1627
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,167
I'm blind?

1628
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,233
No.

1629
01:00:56,233 --> 01:00:57,300
The lights are out!

1630
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:58,867
Silence!

1631
01:00:58,867 --> 01:01:01,533
Who dares disturb my sanctuary?

1632
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:04,133
Who dares disturb my peace?

1633
01:01:04,133 --> 01:01:06,267
He does!

1634
01:01:06,267 --> 01:01:08,367
Silence!

1635
01:01:08,367 --> 01:01:10,500
Why have you come?

1636
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,567
It was her idea.

1637
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:12,600
I just wanted to see the world.

1638
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,667
Dorothy told me that you

1639
01:01:13,667 --> 01:01:14,700
Could...

1640
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:15,767
Silence!

1641
01:01:15,767 --> 01:01:16,833
Why he ask questions then

1642
01:01:16,833 --> 01:01:17,867
Tells us to shut up?

1643
01:01:17,867 --> 01:01:18,967
One at a time!

1644
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:20,500
You!

1645
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,067
Lion!

1646
01:01:22,067 --> 01:01:25,767
What do you want?

1647
01:01:25,767 --> 01:01:26,833
To get the hell out of here!

1648
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:30,067
Tell him.

1649
01:01:30,067 --> 01:01:31,533
Well, sir wiz, sir, I was

1650
01:01:31,533 --> 01:01:34,733
Thinkin', if you happened to

1651
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:35,800
Have an extra spell you weren't

1652
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:36,867
Using just lyin' around.

1653
01:01:36,867 --> 01:01:37,867
Spit it out!

1654
01:01:37,867 --> 01:01:38,967
Courage!

1655
01:01:38,967 --> 01:01:40,567
I would like some courage,

1656
01:01:40,567 --> 01:01:46,067
Please.

1657
01:01:46,067 --> 01:01:47,300
You tellin' me that the king

1658
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,133
Of

1659
01:01:48,133 --> 01:01:49,200
The jungle is a coward?

1660
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,267
Only when I'm awake.

1661
01:01:50,267 --> 01:01:50,767
Or asleep.

1662
01:01:50,767 --> 01:01:52,333
Sometimes I have these dreams...

1663
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:55,067
Silence!

1664
01:01:55,067 --> 01:01:56,067
And you, straw man.

1665
01:01:56,067 --> 01:01:57,067
You lookin' for courage, too?

1666
01:01:57,067 --> 01:01:57,633
Me?

1667
01:01:57,633 --> 01:01:59,733
Nah.

1668
01:01:59,733 --> 01:02:00,767
I ain't got enough sense to be

1669
01:02:00,767 --> 01:02:01,300
Scared of nothin'.

1670
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:04,467
Is that so?

1671
01:02:04,467 --> 01:02:06,067
Except for fire!

1672
01:02:06,067 --> 01:02:07,100
Fire!

1673
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:07,633
Fire!

1674
01:02:07,633 --> 01:02:08,933
Scared of fire!

1675
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:13,433
Would you mind?

1676
01:02:13,433 --> 01:02:18,700
Thank you.

1677
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:20,800
Now, your green-ness, what I

1678
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,367
Would like is a brain.

1679
01:02:22,367 --> 01:02:23,900
What for?

1680
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:24,967
Ain't nobody ever tell you,

1681
01:02:24,967 --> 01:02:26,567
"Ignorance is bliss"?

1682
01:02:26,567 --> 01:02:29,733
Not that I remember.

1683
01:02:29,733 --> 01:02:31,333
And you, little girl.

1684
01:02:31,333 --> 01:02:35,067
What do you want?

1685
01:02:35,067 --> 01:02:38,700
Hello.

1686
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:39,767
My name is Dorothy and I would

1687
01:02:39,767 --> 01:02:40,833
Like to go home.

1688
01:02:40,833 --> 01:02:42,967
So, who's stopping you?

1689
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:43,967
Well, sir, I don't rightly

1690
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:46,633
Know how.

1691
01:02:46,633 --> 01:02:47,667
See, I was heading from my aunt

1692
01:02:47,667 --> 01:02:48,733
Em's farm in Kansas to Omaha,

1693
01:02:48,733 --> 01:02:49,800
Where I was born, when this

1694
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:50,867
Storm blew up and...

1695
01:02:50,867 --> 01:02:51,900
Where'd you say you were

1696
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,467
Born?

1697
01:02:53,467 --> 01:02:54,533
Omaha, Nebraska.

1698
01:02:54,533 --> 01:02:55,567
And where's the auntie's

1699
01:02:55,567 --> 01:02:57,167
Farm?

1700
01:02:57,167 --> 01:02:58,233
Kansas.

1701
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:00,867
So, which one's your home?

1702
01:03:00,867 --> 01:03:01,900
Well, I could've swore I

1703
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:02,967
Knew.

1704
01:03:02,967 --> 01:03:04,067
Well, if you don't know where

1705
01:03:04,067 --> 01:03:05,067
You're goin', how am I expected

1706
01:03:05,067 --> 01:03:06,067
To get you there?

1707
01:03:06,067 --> 01:03:09,800
Step back!

1708
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,933
And you, rin-tin-tin, what are

1709
01:03:11,933 --> 01:03:12,967
You looking for?

1710
01:03:12,967 --> 01:03:16,700
A can opener?

1711
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:20,367
That's very clever.

1712
01:03:20,367 --> 01:03:21,900
You are clever.

1713
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:23,533
Scary as hell, but clever.

1714
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:24,600
You think I got time to mess

1715
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,200
With fools?

1716
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,300
Tell me what you want, what you

1717
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:29,833
Really, really want!

1718
01:03:29,833 --> 01:03:32,500
A heart.

1719
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,067
A heart, your wizness.

1720
01:03:34,067 --> 01:03:35,133
You tellin' me you're

1721
01:03:35,133 --> 01:03:36,200
Heartless?

1722
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,233
I'm afraid so.

1723
01:03:37,233 --> 01:03:38,833
Then count yourself lucky!

1724
01:03:38,833 --> 01:03:41,467
Think of what you're avoiding,

1725
01:03:41,467 --> 01:03:43,567
Heartburn, heartache, and the

1726
01:03:43,567 --> 01:03:45,700
Occasional heartbreak of

1727
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:48,333
Psoriasis.

1728
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:49,900
Oh, but sir, think about

1729
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:53,967
Everything else I'm missing.

1730
01:04:02,833 --> 01:04:05,167
* whoa, whoa, whoa

1731
01:04:05,167 --> 01:04:10,400
What would I do

1732
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:15,700
If I could suddenly feel *

1733
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:21,067
* and know once again

1734
01:04:21,067 --> 01:04:26,267
What I feel is real *

1735
01:04:26,267 --> 01:04:32,600
* I could cry, I could smile

1736
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,733
And I might lay back for a

1737
01:04:34,733 --> 01:04:36,300
While *

1738
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:38,400
* tell me what

1739
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,533
What would I do *

1740
01:04:40,533 --> 01:04:46,333
* if I could feel

1741
01:04:46,333 --> 01:04:52,667
What would I do *

1742
01:04:52,667 --> 01:04:57,967
* if I could reach inside of me

1743
01:04:57,967 --> 01:05:03,533
And know how it feels

1744
01:05:03,533 --> 01:05:06,433
To say I like what I see *

1745
01:05:06,433 --> 01:05:09,067
* then I'd be more than glad to

1746
01:05:09,067 --> 01:05:12,767
Share

1747
01:05:12,767 --> 01:05:16,967
All that I have inside of here *

1748
01:05:16,967 --> 01:05:19,633
* and the songs my heart might

1749
01:05:19,633 --> 01:05:22,767
Bring

1750
01:05:22,767 --> 01:05:24,333
You'd be more than glad to

1751
01:05:24,333 --> 01:05:29,100
Sing *

1752
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:33,300
* and if a tear came to my eye

1753
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:34,933
Think of all the wounds they

1754
01:05:34,933 --> 01:05:38,100
Mend *

1755
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:41,200
* and just to think

1756
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,933
The time I could spend

1757
01:05:44,933 --> 01:05:48,133
Being vulnerable again *

1758
01:05:48,133 --> 01:05:50,767
* tell me what

1759
01:05:50,767 --> 01:05:53,900
What, what would I do *

1760
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:57,100
* tell me what

1761
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:58,900
What, what would I do *

1762
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:01,300
* woah, tell me what

1763
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:03,400
What, what would I do *

1764
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,067
* what I would do, if I could

1765
01:06:06,067 --> 01:06:09,733
Feel

1766
01:06:09,733 --> 01:06:19,167
If I could feel *

1767
01:06:19,167 --> 01:06:26,600
* if I could feel

1768
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:29,100
**

1769
01:06:36,867 --> 01:06:39,567
I, the all powerful wiz, have

1770
01:06:39,567 --> 01:06:40,600
Decided to grant your wishes,

1771
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:43,267
But...

1772
01:06:43,267 --> 01:06:44,333
Hey!

1773
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:45,400
I said but!

1774
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,433
Did you not hear me say "but?"

1775
01:06:46,433 --> 01:06:48,067
There's a but coming.

1776
01:06:48,067 --> 01:06:49,600
There always is.

1777
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:50,667
But I want a little something

1778
01:06:50,667 --> 01:06:53,833
In return.

1779
01:06:53,833 --> 01:06:56,467
I will grant all four of your

1780
01:06:56,467 --> 01:06:58,567
Wishes, but first you gotta kill

1781
01:06:58,567 --> 01:07:01,233
The wicked witch of the west.

1782
01:07:01,233 --> 01:07:02,833
Kill the wicked witch?

1783
01:07:02,833 --> 01:07:03,900
Ain't no big thing.

1784
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:04,933
You already wasted her sister.

1785
01:07:04,933 --> 01:07:07,567
How'd he know about that?

1786
01:07:07,567 --> 01:07:10,233
I am the all-seeing,

1787
01:07:10,233 --> 01:07:10,967
All-knowing, all-powerful wizard

1788
01:07:10,967 --> 01:07:12,333
Of oz.

1789
01:07:12,333 --> 01:07:14,433
I know stuff!

1790
01:07:14,433 --> 01:07:16,867
You want what you want?

1791
01:07:16,867 --> 01:07:17,367
No half stepping.

1792
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:19,200
Kill me that witch!

1793
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:24,467
I have spoken!

1794
01:07:24,467 --> 01:07:25,533
Why don't you kill her

1795
01:07:25,533 --> 01:07:26,567
Yourself?

1796
01:07:26,567 --> 01:07:29,233
You don't think I could?

1797
01:07:29,233 --> 01:07:29,967
And I would, except I've got to

1798
01:07:29,967 --> 01:07:30,833
Stay here and protect the

1799
01:07:30,833 --> 01:07:32,467
Emerald city.

1800
01:07:32,467 --> 01:07:32,900
From who?

1801
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:33,967
From the wicked witch of the

1802
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:35,067
West!

1803
01:07:35,067 --> 01:07:37,133
Are you not paying attention?

1804
01:07:37,133 --> 01:07:38,167
But what's any of that got to

1805
01:07:38,167 --> 01:07:38,733
Do with me?

1806
01:07:38,733 --> 01:07:40,300
What do you mean?

1807
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:42,900
It's all your fault.

1808
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:43,967
Everything was fine when there

1809
01:07:43,967 --> 01:07:45,567
Was a witch for every corner of

1810
01:07:45,567 --> 01:07:47,667
Oz.

1811
01:07:47,667 --> 01:07:48,733
But then you come along dropping

1812
01:07:48,733 --> 01:07:50,833
Houses where they don't belong

1813
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:51,867
And suddenly there's a whole

1814
01:07:51,867 --> 01:07:54,533
Territory up for grabs.

1815
01:07:54,533 --> 01:07:55,567
Right now evillene is plotting a

1816
01:07:55,567 --> 01:07:57,167
Take-over of oz.

1817
01:07:57,167 --> 01:07:58,767
She must be stopped.

1818
01:07:58,767 --> 01:07:59,800
And you're the one needs to do

1819
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:00,867
It.

1820
01:08:00,867 --> 01:08:03,500
Why me?

1821
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:07,200
'Cause I said so, and I am

1822
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:11,400
The all knowing, all powerful

1823
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:19,300
Wiz and I have spoken!

1824
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:20,100
Well, Dorothy.

1825
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:20,867
Good luck.

1826
01:08:20,867 --> 01:08:21,933
We're all counting on you.

1827
01:08:21,933 --> 01:08:23,533
Me?

1828
01:08:23,533 --> 01:08:25,633
The wiz was loud and clear,

1829
01:08:25,633 --> 01:08:29,333
This whole mess is your fault.

1830
01:08:29,333 --> 01:08:29,833
My fault?

1831
01:08:29,833 --> 01:08:30,900
Your tornado.

1832
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:31,967
Your house.

1833
01:08:31,967 --> 01:08:32,500
Your fault!

1834
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:33,567
You broke it.

1835
01:08:33,567 --> 01:08:34,600
You bought it.

1836
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,167
So, good luck killing that

1837
01:08:36,167 --> 01:08:37,333
Old

1838
01:08:37,333 --> 01:08:38,433
Witch.

1839
01:08:38,433 --> 01:08:39,167
Be sure to let us know when it's

1840
01:08:39,167 --> 01:08:40,067
Done.

1841
01:08:40,067 --> 01:08:41,067
We'll be waitin' in the bar.

1842
01:08:41,067 --> 01:08:41,733
Isn't that just typical?

1843
01:08:41,733 --> 01:08:42,633
All three of you were fine

1844
01:08:42,633 --> 01:08:43,700
Coming along when you thought

1845
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:44,767
You were gettin' something for

1846
01:08:44,767 --> 01:08:45,500
Nothing, but now that there's a

1847
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:46,333
Price to pay you want to wait it

1848
01:08:46,333 --> 01:08:47,400
Out in the bar?

1849
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:48,967
Cowards!

1850
01:08:48,967 --> 01:08:50,567
You calling me a coward?

1851
01:08:50,567 --> 01:08:51,633
Yes!

1852
01:08:51,633 --> 01:08:56,700
Yes, I'm a coward.

1853
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:58,400
Hasn't that been established?

1854
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,433
And I'm sorry, Dorothy, but

1855
01:08:59,433 --> 01:09:00,500
You know what my last run-in

1856
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,067
With that witch done to me.

1857
01:09:02,067 --> 01:09:02,800
And I don't know how to help

1858
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,200
You because I don't know how to

1859
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:04,900
Kill a witch because I don't

1860
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:05,767
Know anything!

1861
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:06,800
Y'all!

1862
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:07,867
I thought you were my squad, now

1863
01:09:07,867 --> 01:09:08,933
Y'all are wimping out on me?

1864
01:09:08,933 --> 01:09:10,067
Lion, courage!

1865
01:09:10,067 --> 01:09:11,067
If evillene needs to go, we're

1866
01:09:11,067 --> 01:09:12,633
Sending her out together.

1867
01:09:12,633 --> 01:09:13,567
Says you!

1868
01:09:14,733 --> 01:09:18,433
* I'm not doing this

1869
01:09:18,433 --> 01:09:19,500
Even I know it don't make no

1870
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:22,633
Sense *

1871
01:09:22,633 --> 01:09:23,700
* breaking a heart got me this

1872
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:26,300
Way

1873
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:27,367
I ain't in a rush to see that

1874
01:09:27,367 --> 01:09:28,933
Again *

1875
01:09:28,933 --> 01:09:31,067
* just thinkin' 'bout it is

1876
01:09:31,067 --> 01:09:37,367
Terrifyin'

1877
01:09:37,367 --> 01:09:40,067
Oh you ain't gonna give up on me

1878
01:09:40,067 --> 01:09:44,233
Now

1879
01:09:44,233 --> 01:09:47,400
I won't let you turn around *

1880
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,533
* this won't be easy, no way no

1881
01:09:49,533 --> 01:09:52,167
How

1882
01:09:52,167 --> 01:09:54,767
But we won't back down *

1883
01:09:54,767 --> 01:09:56,367
* when the night is so cold,

1884
01:09:56,367 --> 01:09:57,967
Dark and lonely

1885
01:09:57,967 --> 01:10:00,067
All you gotta do is look at me *

1886
01:10:00,067 --> 01:10:02,700
* and hear what I say

1887
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:04,800
We got it

1888
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:05,867
We got it *

1889
01:10:05,867 --> 01:10:06,900
* and I got you

1890
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:08,500

1891
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:09,533
* so we got it

1892
01:10:09,533 --> 01:10:10,633
We got it *

1893
01:10:10,633 --> 01:10:11,667
* so we got it

1894
01:10:11,667 --> 01:10:17,500
Together we do *

1895
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,600
* so close yet so far

1896
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,633
I can see our dreams from

1897
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:21,700
Standing

1898
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:24,333
Right where we are *

1899
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:26,967
* only thing that's in our way

1900
01:10:26,967 --> 01:10:29,067
Are these impossible odds *

1901
01:10:29,067 --> 01:10:30,633

Something

Ah, make it something I can

What are you doing?

Get up from there!

2110
01:17:24,067 --> 01:17:25,900
Higher, higher!

Work!

2112
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:29,233

Work!

Now, bring me something I can

**

2148
01:18:57,333 --> 01:18:58,367
'Cause I ain't goin' for it!

2149
01:18:58,367 --> 01:19:03,100
Now get back to work!

2150
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:05,733
Now, break it down.

2151
01:19:05,733 --> 01:19:06,800
Well, I'm afraid it's bad

2152
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:12,067
News.

2153
01:19:12,067 --> 01:19:14,167
Dorothy and her friends are on

2154
01:19:14,167 --> 01:19:16,833
Their way here to kill you.

2155
01:19:16,833 --> 01:19:18,400
That's not such bad news.

2156
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:19,967
It's not nice news.

2157
01:19:19,967 --> 01:19:22,600
But it's not terrible.

2158
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:24,200
I mean, if you're gonna be a

2159
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:25,233
Wicked witch, and you are good

2160
01:19:25,233 --> 01:19:26,833
At your job, you're gonna have

2161
01:19:26,833 --> 01:19:27,567
To expect to rub some folks the

2162
01:19:27,567 --> 01:19:28,933
Wrong way.

2163
01:19:28,933 --> 01:19:31,600
I s'pose.

2164
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,700
So, Dorothy thinks she can

2165
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:35,267
March her skinny ass in here and

2166
01:19:35,267 --> 01:19:36,333
Destroy me?

2167
01:19:36,333 --> 01:19:37,400
Well, it ain't my first time

2168
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,500
Runnin' the nursery.

2169
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,067
I know how to handle a brat like

2170
01:19:41,067 --> 01:19:42,667
That.

2171
01:19:42,667 --> 01:19:44,767
Unleash my winged warriors!

2172
01:19:44,767 --> 01:19:46,367
Not your winged warriors.

2173
01:19:46,367 --> 01:19:47,400
Oh, yes, my winged warriors.

2174
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:52,700
Fly!

2175
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:58,500
Fly, my warriors!

2176
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,067
Capture the intruders and bring

2177
01:20:00,067 --> 01:20:01,633
Them back to me.

2178
01:20:01,633 --> 01:20:02,733
Now fly!

2179
01:20:02,733 --> 01:20:04,267
Fly!

2180
01:20:04,267 --> 01:20:05,333
And don't nobody scuff up my

2181
01:20:05,333 --> 01:20:06,267
Sister's shoes!

2182
01:20:34,867 --> 01:20:40,833
**

2183
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:52,067
You!

2184
01:20:52,067 --> 01:20:53,100
Another bucket here.

2185
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:54,167
And one over there.

2186
01:20:54,167 --> 01:20:54,900
If evillene finds water on the

2187
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:56,800
Floor...

2188
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:01,167
Back it up, top cat.

2189
01:21:01,167 --> 01:21:02,900
Are those buckets full?

2190
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:04,467
If I get that last one will

2191
01:21:04,467 --> 01:21:08,833
That make you happy?

2192
01:21:08,833 --> 01:21:10,400
I think you left a spot.

2193
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:14,333
If I get it, will you be

2194
01:21:14,333 --> 01:21:15,400
Satisfied then?

2195
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:15,833
Satisfied?

2196
01:21:15,833 --> 01:21:18,667
Me?

2197
01:21:18,667 --> 01:21:19,733
Right.

2198
01:21:19,733 --> 01:21:20,767
Dorothy!

2199
01:21:20,767 --> 01:21:21,833
Oh, lion.

2200
01:21:21,833 --> 01:21:22,900
That old witch has me scrubbing

2201
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:23,967
And polishing.

2202
01:21:23,967 --> 01:21:25,067
I will never complain about any

2203
01:21:25,067 --> 01:21:26,067
Chore aunt em gives me ever

2204
01:21:26,067 --> 01:21:27,633
Again.

2205
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:30,700
I'm on mop duty.

2206
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:31,767
That old witch is definitely

2207
01:21:31,767 --> 01:21:35,233
Afraid of water.

2208
01:21:35,233 --> 01:21:36,300
They say she don't even bathe.

2209
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:37,367
She sends herself out once a

2210
01:21:37,367 --> 01:21:38,433
Week for dry cleaning.

2211
01:21:38,433 --> 01:21:39,100
Excuse me, my lord high

2212
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:40,067
Underling, but did you hear me

2213
01:21:40,067 --> 01:21:41,067
Give anybody a coffee break?

2214
01:21:41,067 --> 01:21:42,133
No, ma'am.

2215
01:21:42,133 --> 01:21:43,200
Not during my lifetime.

2216
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:44,233
Oh, please, Ms. witch.

2217
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:46,867
We haven't seen each other...

2218
01:21:46,867 --> 01:21:47,933
Ask me if I care?

2219
01:21:47,933 --> 01:21:51,100
Back to work!

2220
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:52,200
No wonder they call you

2221
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:54,267
Wicked.

2222
01:21:54,267 --> 01:21:54,800
No.

2223
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:55,833
Know what?

2224
01:21:55,833 --> 01:21:56,900
You don't got game enough to be

2225
01:21:56,900 --> 01:22:01,667
Wicked.

2226
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:05,533
All you are is plain old

2227
01:22:05,533 --> 01:22:08,233
Everyday passable mean.

2228
01:22:08,233 --> 01:22:09,300
Well, if I'm mean... what

2229
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:10,367
Does that make you?

2230
01:22:10,367 --> 01:22:11,433
Don't make me nothing.

2231
01:22:11,433 --> 01:22:12,467
Think not?

2232
01:22:12,467 --> 01:22:13,533
Which one of us dropped a house

2233
01:22:13,533 --> 01:22:14,567
On the other one's sister?

2234
01:22:14,567 --> 01:22:15,633
And which one of us yanked the

2235
01:22:15,633 --> 01:22:16,700
Silver heels right off of that

2236
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:18,233
Dead sister's not-even-cold-yet

2237
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:19,933
Feet?

2238
01:22:19,933 --> 01:22:21,500
And which one of us gathered up

2239
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:22,833
A crew to put a hit on the other

2240
01:22:22,833 --> 01:22:24,567
One?

2241
01:22:24,567 --> 01:22:25,633
You're three for three, little

2242
01:22:25,633 --> 01:22:26,700
Girl, so before you go castin'

2243
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:27,733
Shade, I'd take myself a good

2244
01:22:27,733 --> 01:22:28,800
Look in the mirror.

2245
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:29,400
Now... get back to work.

2246
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,400
When are you going to let us

2247
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:30,900
Go?

2248
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:32,067
When you gonna give me them

2249
01:22:32,067 --> 01:22:33,067
Kicks?

2250
01:22:33,067 --> 01:22:34,100
I promised addaperle...

2251
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:35,133
"I promised addaperle..."

2252
01:22:35,133 --> 01:22:36,200
This child still thinks I'm

2253
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,833
Playin'?

2254
01:22:38,833 --> 01:22:39,933
Lord high underling, send in my

2255
01:22:39,933 --> 01:22:47,800
Dinner!

2256
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:49,400
Tell, oh, lord high, what's on

2257
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:53,067
My menu for tonight?

2258
01:22:53,067 --> 01:22:55,167
Forest lion stew!

2259
01:22:55,167 --> 01:22:56,233
It's a new recipe from

2260
01:22:56,233 --> 01:23:00,067
"Witches wear nightly."

2261
01:23:00,067 --> 01:23:03,100
This old tin can will make a

2262
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:04,133
Fine stew pot once I pop the top

2263
01:23:04,133 --> 01:23:06,267
Off it.

2264
01:23:06,267 --> 01:23:08,367
And this useless bag of hay will

2265
01:23:08,367 --> 01:23:09,933
Start a good strong fire.

2266
01:23:09,933 --> 01:23:13,633
But first...

2267
01:23:13,633 --> 01:23:15,200
I got me a lion to filet!

2268
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,267
Get away from my friends you

2269
01:23:16,267 --> 01:23:22,067
Evil old witch!

2270
01:23:22,067 --> 01:23:25,433
Dorothy, always so brave.

2271
01:23:25,433 --> 01:23:27,300
You want to be a hero?

2272
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:31,267
You'll be dinner too.

2273
01:23:31,267 --> 01:23:33,500
Oh, no, not water!

2274
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:34,067
No!

2275
01:23:34,067 --> 01:23:35,100
What have you done?

No cutting in front.

2387
01:27:35,700 --> 01:27:40,433
Go to the end of the line.

2388
01:27:40,433 --> 01:27:41,467
Respect, my brother.

2389
01:27:41,467 --> 01:27:43,067
We are back to see the wiz.

2390
01:27:43,067 --> 01:27:45,200
And before you go tellin' us our

2391
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,300
Names are not on the list, allow

2392
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:49,933
Me to elucidate current events.

2393
01:27:49,933 --> 01:27:51,533
Dorothy just killed the wicked

2394
01:27:51,533 --> 01:27:52,567
Witch of the west.

2395
01:27:52,567 --> 01:27:54,167
For those of you keeping score,

2396
01:27:54,167 --> 01:27:55,233
That's two wicked witches in two

2397
01:27:55,233 --> 01:27:57,833
Days.

2398
01:27:57,833 --> 01:28:00,067
So I dare say there ain't a list

2399
01:28:00,067 --> 01:28:01,067
Anywhere in oz without our names

2400
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:05,200
On it.

2401
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:06,267
Allow me to apologize.

2402
01:28:06,267 --> 01:28:08,367
You sure are on the list.

2403
01:28:08,367 --> 01:28:09,400
Right here at the top of the

2404
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:10,467
Page.

2405
01:28:10,467 --> 01:28:12,600
"Dorothy, lion, scarecrow and"

2406
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:14,700
Tinman are hereby and forthwith

2407
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:15,767
Legally and terminally banned

2408
01:28:15,767 --> 01:28:16,833
From entering the emerald city

2409
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:18,400
By executive order of the wiz.

2410
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:19,433
No exceptions.

2411
01:28:19,433 --> 01:28:19,967
No excuses.

2412
01:28:19,967 --> 01:28:21,567
"No refunds."

2413
01:28:21,567 --> 01:28:22,633
Banned?

2414
01:28:22,633 --> 01:28:23,700
Banned!

2415
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:24,733
As in...

2416
01:28:24,733 --> 01:28:25,800
Personae non-gracious.

2417
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:26,533
Now, back up and let the other

2418
01:28:26,533 --> 01:28:28,967
Folks through.

2419
01:28:28,967 --> 01:28:30,533
There are no other folks!

2420
01:28:30,533 --> 01:28:32,667
It's no use.

2421
01:28:32,667 --> 01:28:34,767
We can't get in.

2422
01:28:34,767 --> 01:28:36,367
We'll have to find someplace

2423
01:28:36,367 --> 01:28:38,467
Else to spend the night.

2424
01:28:38,467 --> 01:28:39,533
Yeah.

2425
01:28:39,533 --> 01:28:40,600
I guess you're right.

2426
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,167
But what are we going to do

2427
01:28:42,167 --> 01:28:43,767
With that big bag of gold that

2428
01:28:43,767 --> 01:28:44,800
We got from the wicked witch?

2429
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,367
Big bag of gold?

2430
01:28:46,367 --> 01:28:47,967
Oh!

2431
01:28:47,967 --> 01:28:50,600
The big bag of gold!

2432
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:52,733
Yes.

2433
01:28:52,733 --> 01:28:53,767
The big bag of gold is way too

2434
01:28:53,767 --> 01:28:55,367
Heavy to carry around all night.

2435
01:28:55,367 --> 01:28:56,400
That's no problem.

2436
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:57,467
I dug a hole in the ground

2437
01:28:57,467 --> 01:28:58,533
Around the corner and hid the

2438
01:28:58,533 --> 01:29:01,167
Gold in there.

2439
01:29:01,167 --> 01:29:03,267
Are you sure it will be safe?

2440
01:29:03,267 --> 01:29:04,867
Now who would go lookin' for

2441
01:29:04,867 --> 01:29:06,967
A big bag of gold in a little

2442
01:29:06,967 --> 01:29:09,600
Hole around the corner?

2443
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,233
Terrific.

2444
01:29:11,233 --> 01:29:12,800
Let's go find a safe place to

2445
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:13,833
Spend the night.

2446
01:29:13,833 --> 01:29:28,100
After you, my dear.

2447
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:29,133
Ladies first.

2448
01:29:29,133 --> 01:29:30,200
Scarecrow, you are a genius.

2449
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:31,800
There's nothing like greed to

2450
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:32,733
Turn a wise man into a fool.

2451
01:29:46,067 --> 01:29:47,633
Mr. wiz?

2452
01:29:47,633 --> 01:29:48,167
Mr. wiz, sir?

2453
01:29:48,167 --> 01:29:49,200
We're back.

2454
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:50,267
I don't think anyone's here.

2455
01:29:50,267 --> 01:29:50,867
He's here all right.

2456
01:29:50,867 --> 01:29:51,833
I can smell him.

2457
01:29:51,833 --> 01:29:52,867
Hello?

2458
01:29:52,867 --> 01:29:53,933
Mr. wiz?

2459
01:29:53,933 --> 01:29:55,533
Huh?

2460
01:29:55,533 --> 01:29:57,633
Um, who goes there?

2461
01:29:57,633 --> 01:29:59,200
It's Dorothy, sir.

2462
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:00,267
We took care of things like you

2463
01:30:00,267 --> 01:30:01,833
Told us.

2464
01:30:01,833 --> 01:30:02,867
The wicked witch of the west is

2465
01:30:02,867 --> 01:30:03,933
Done in.

2466
01:30:03,933 --> 01:30:04,467
Eliminated.

2467
01:30:04,467 --> 01:30:05,533
One might even say

2468
01:30:05,533 --> 01:30:07,100
Liquidated.

2469
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:09,233
So, what do you want from me?

2470
01:30:09,233 --> 01:30:11,867
Just what you promised.

2471
01:30:11,867 --> 01:30:13,467
I promised nothing.

2472
01:30:13,467 --> 01:30:16,100
Oh, you certainly did.

2473
01:30:16,100 --> 01:30:18,200
Can't say I recall.

2474
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:27,167
Begone.

2475
01:30:27,167 --> 01:30:28,233
What happened?

2476
01:30:28,233 --> 01:30:32,967
Lion pulled the plug.

2477
01:30:32,967 --> 01:30:35,767
I knew I smelled a rat!

2478
01:30:35,767 --> 01:30:37,433
Is that the the wiz?

2479
01:30:37,433 --> 01:30:38,500
I am the all powerful, all

2480
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:40,100
Knowing, all seeing, all for

2481
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:50,333
Nothin'...

2482
01:30:50,333 --> 01:30:51,500
All for nothing.

2483
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:52,567
Hello.

2484
01:30:52,567 --> 01:30:53,100
You don't mean...

2485
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:54,167
Couldn't be...

2486
01:30:54,167 --> 01:30:55,200
You mean the wiz is...

2487
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,267
A fraud!

2488
01:30:56,267 --> 01:30:57,300
And a woman!

2489
01:30:57,300 --> 01:30:58,033
And what's wrong with being a

2490
01:30:58,033 --> 01:30:58,867
Woman?

2491
01:30:58,867 --> 01:31:02,933
Nothing.

2492
01:31:02,933 --> 01:31:04,100
That's right, nothing wrong

2493
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:06,200
With bein' a woman!

2494
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:06,867
Don't know where you fools

2495
01:31:06,867 --> 01:31:07,800
Learned your manners.

2496
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:08,867
But there's everything wrong

2497
01:31:08,867 --> 01:31:09,900
With lying!

2498
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:13,600
Who you calling a liar?

2499
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:16,233
Oh.

2500
01:31:16,233 --> 01:31:17,633
Right.

2501
01:31:17,633 --> 01:31:19,867
Me.

2502
01:31:19,867 --> 01:31:20,933
I'm nothin' but a huckster from

2503
01:31:20,933 --> 01:31:22,067
Omaha.

2504
01:31:22,067 --> 01:31:23,567
Omaha?

2505
01:31:23,567 --> 01:31:25,133
Howdy, neighbor.

2506
01:31:25,133 --> 01:31:27,767
But how'd you get here?

2507
01:31:27,767 --> 01:31:29,367
Oh, little girl, the places

2508
01:31:29,367 --> 01:31:30,933
You wind up when you don't look

2509
01:31:30,933 --> 01:31:33,600
Where you're going.

2510
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,167
Back in Omaha I had me a job as

2511
01:31:35,167 --> 01:31:37,300
A magician's assistant.

2512
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:39,400
"The amazing Alfred & company."

2513
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:42,067
I was "and company."

2514
01:31:42,067 --> 01:31:43,067
We'd do magic at night but

2515
01:31:43,067 --> 01:31:44,133
During the day we gave folks

2516
01:31:44,133 --> 01:31:46,233
Rides in a hot air balloon.

2517
01:31:46,233 --> 01:31:47,833
That was the part I liked.

2518
01:31:47,833 --> 01:31:49,400
I loved flying.

2519
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:50,467
But unfortunately, I hated

2520
01:31:50,467 --> 01:31:57,833
Alfred.

2521
01:31:57,833 --> 01:31:59,433
Well, one day he just pushed me

2522
01:31:59,433 --> 01:32:00,500
Too far.

2523
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:01,533
I hopped into that hot air

2524
01:32:01,533 --> 01:32:03,100
Balloon and took off for the

2525
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:05,200
Sky.

2526
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:06,267
Oh.

2527
01:32:06,267 --> 01:32:07,333
I wasn't planning to

2528
01:32:07,333 --> 01:32:08,400
Disappear.

2529
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:09,967
I just wanted to teach mean old

2530
01:32:09,967 --> 01:32:15,233
Alfred a lesson.

2531
01:32:15,233 --> 01:32:16,833
But out of nowhere came a storm

2532
01:32:16,833 --> 01:32:17,867
With winds and rain so strong it

2533
01:32:17,867 --> 01:32:19,467
Was all I could do to stay in

2534
01:32:19,467 --> 01:32:21,567
That thing.

2535
01:32:21,567 --> 01:32:23,133
I hunkered down and hid my eyes

2536
01:32:23,133 --> 01:32:25,767
For what felt like forever, and

2537
01:32:25,767 --> 01:32:29,967
When I landed, here I was.

2538
01:32:29,967 --> 01:32:31,067
Folks came rushing from every

2539
01:32:31,067 --> 01:32:32,067
Which way to see what had blown

2540
01:32:32,067 --> 01:32:34,700
In on the wind.

2541
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:36,800
Not wanting to disappoint

2542
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:37,867
Nobody, I quick put on old

2543
01:32:37,867 --> 01:32:39,967
Alfred's black top hat and cape

2544
01:32:39,967 --> 01:32:41,533
And did my best to give the

2545
01:32:41,533 --> 01:32:44,700
Folks a magic show.

2546
01:32:44,700 --> 01:32:47,333
Next thing I knew they slapped

2547
01:32:47,333 --> 01:32:51,067
Fancy threads on me, set me up

2548
01:32:51,067 --> 01:32:53,133
In these digs and proclaimed me

2549
01:32:53,133 --> 01:32:55,233
The all powerful wizard of oz.

2550
01:32:55,233 --> 01:32:56,300
Couldn't you tell someone the

2551
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:58,433
Truth?

2552
01:32:58,433 --> 01:33:00,067
I tried. But they were so

2553
01:33:00,067 --> 01:33:01,067
Happy to have a wizard they

2554
01:33:01,067 --> 01:33:02,667
Thought could protect them from

2555
01:33:02,667 --> 01:33:04,200
Evillene and evvamean they

2556
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:08,967
Wouldn't hear it.

2557
01:33:08,967 --> 01:33:11,567
So here I am, all these years

2558
01:33:11,567 --> 01:33:14,233
Later, hiding in the dark lest

2559
01:33:14,233 --> 01:33:15,267
Anyone find out what a nothing I

2560
01:33:15,267 --> 01:33:17,400
Really am.

2561
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:18,967
We been played.

2562
01:33:18,967 --> 01:33:20,067
That's wack, gettin' our

2563
01:33:20,067 --> 01:33:22,633
Hopes up.

2564
01:33:22,633 --> 01:33:23,700
I never thought you'd be

2565
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:25,300
Brave enough to take on old

2566
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:26,333
Evillene.

2567
01:33:26,333 --> 01:33:28,467
Well we did.

2568
01:33:28,467 --> 01:33:30,067
Exactly.

2569
01:33:30,067 --> 01:33:32,133
Now listen up.

2570
01:33:32,133 --> 01:33:33,733
You don't need nothin' from me.

2571
01:33:33,733 --> 01:33:37,433
None of you.

2572
01:33:37,433 --> 01:33:40,067
Lion, you say you got no

2573
01:33:40,067 --> 01:33:41,633
Courage, but you were part of

2574
01:33:41,633 --> 01:33:43,200
The team that took out the

2575
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:44,800
Wickedest witch that ever was.

2576
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:46,900
Shakin' the whole time.

2577
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:48,433
Being scared of scary stuff

2578
01:33:48,433 --> 01:33:50,533
Is smart.

2579
01:33:50,533 --> 01:33:52,700
Respecting danger but still

2580
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:55,300
Takin' care of business?

2581
01:33:55,300 --> 01:33:58,467
Ace, that's courage!

2582
01:33:58,467 --> 01:34:00,067
What'd'ya know?

2583
01:34:00,067 --> 01:34:03,200
I got courage.

2584
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:04,267
And scarecrow, you say you

2585
01:34:04,267 --> 01:34:06,933
Got no brain?

2586
01:34:06,933 --> 01:34:08,500
The surest sign that you're

2587
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:10,067
Talking to a dummy is when he

2588
01:34:10,067 --> 01:34:12,733
Tells you he knows it all.

2589
01:34:12,733 --> 01:34:13,800
It takes a quality mind to know

2590
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:15,367
That there's always more to

2591
01:34:15,367 --> 01:34:17,467
Learn.

2592
01:34:17,467 --> 01:34:18,533
You, my friend, are of that

2593
01:34:18,533 --> 01:34:20,633
Brainiac persuasion.

2594
01:34:20,633 --> 01:34:22,767
So, knowing that I know

2595
01:34:22,767 --> 01:34:25,933
Nothing proves I know something?

2596
01:34:25,933 --> 01:34:30,667
What do you know?

2597
01:34:30,667 --> 01:34:32,267
And you, tinman.

2598
01:34:32,267 --> 01:34:34,900
No heart?

2599
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:36,500
You haven't left Dorothy's side

2600
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:39,133
Since you got here.

2601
01:34:39,133 --> 01:34:41,767
If the way you protect her isn't

2602
01:34:41,767 --> 01:34:42,833
Proof of a good heart, then I

2603
01:34:42,833 --> 01:34:46,500
Don't know what is.

2604
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:49,167
Oh, I know I have a heart

2605
01:34:49,167 --> 01:34:50,733
Because, just thinking about

2606
01:34:50,733 --> 01:34:52,333
Dorothy leaving, has it

2607
01:34:52,333 --> 01:34:55,500
Breaking.

2608
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:56,567
Don't start getting all

2609
01:34:56,567 --> 01:35:00,267
Rusted up again.

2610
01:35:00,267 --> 01:35:02,367
Besides, I'm not going anywhere,

2611
01:35:02,367 --> 01:35:06,067
Am I, miss wiz?

2612
01:35:06,067 --> 01:35:07,633
Home is a place.

2613
01:35:07,633 --> 01:35:08,700
No fancy words are going to get

2614
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:15,833
Me there.

2615
01:35:15,833 --> 01:35:17,567
I'm sorry to say the little

2616
01:35:17,567 --> 01:35:19,133
Sister's right.

2617
01:35:19,133 --> 01:35:20,167
Excuse me, but didn't you say

2618
01:35:20,167 --> 01:35:21,267
You've got a balloon?

2619
01:35:21,267 --> 01:35:23,133
The balloon?

2620
01:35:23,133 --> 01:35:24,300
Surely

2621
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:25,867
You're not suggesting...

2622
01:35:25,867 --> 01:35:26,933
Why not?

2623
01:35:26,933 --> 01:35:27,500
And leave all this?

2624
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:29,067
I got a title.

2625
01:35:29,067 --> 01:35:31,167
I got a throne room.

2626
01:35:31,167 --> 01:35:32,733
I got folks so scared of me they

2627
01:35:32,733 --> 01:35:34,833
Dare not knock on my door.

2628
01:35:34,833 --> 01:35:36,433
Now that's a great way to

2629
01:35:36,433 --> 01:35:38,067
Live.

2630
01:35:38,067 --> 01:35:41,167
Locked inside a fancy prison

2631
01:35:41,167 --> 01:35:42,200
Lest somebody figure out who you

2632
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:43,267
Really are.

2633
01:35:43,267 --> 01:35:44,833
Let her be.

2634
01:35:44,833 --> 01:35:45,900
She got a right to choose the

2635
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:48,567
Way she wants to live.

2636
01:35:48,567 --> 01:35:50,133
Maybe she don't want no friends

2637
01:35:50,133 --> 01:35:51,700
Or family.

2638
01:35:51,700 --> 01:35:53,300
Maybe she don't care about the

2639
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:54,333
Wonderful world just beyond

2640
01:35:54,333 --> 01:35:55,933
Those doors.

2641
01:35:55,933 --> 01:35:58,567
Yeah.

2642
01:35:58,567 --> 01:36:00,133
Maybe she don't miss

2643
01:36:00,133 --> 01:36:04,333
Conversatin' or sharing a laugh.

2644
01:36:04,333 --> 01:36:06,467
Maybe she don't need to feel a

2645
01:36:06,467 --> 01:36:09,100
Warm hug or a friendly handshake

2646
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:10,167
Or a loving kiss ever again.

2647
01:36:10,167 --> 01:36:15,933
Yeah.

2648
01:36:15,933 --> 01:36:17,533
Maybe she wants to be stuck

2649
01:36:17,533 --> 01:36:18,567
In this room, alone in the dark,

2650
01:36:18,567 --> 01:36:19,633
'Til the end of her days.

2651
01:36:19,633 --> 01:36:22,267
Layin' it on a little thick?

2652
01:36:22,267 --> 01:36:23,333
All right.

2653
01:36:23,333 --> 01:36:24,367
All right.

2654
01:36:24,367 --> 01:36:28,067
You made your point.

2655
01:36:28,067 --> 01:36:30,733
I've had a nice vacation, maybe

2656
01:36:30,733 --> 01:36:31,800
It's time to get back to the

2657
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:38,500
Real world.

2658
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:39,700
So, who needs a lift to

2659
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:40,767
Omaha?

2660
01:36:40,767 --> 01:36:41,833
Me.

2661
01:36:41,833 --> 01:36:43,767
Oh, please, me.

2662
01:37:01,067 --> 01:37:04,300
Citizens of oz.

2663
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:05,367
There is a time to every purpose

2664
01:37:05,367 --> 01:37:06,933
Under heaven.

2665
01:37:06,933 --> 01:37:09,067
A time to keep.

2666
01:37:09,067 --> 01:37:12,767
And a time to cast away.

2667
01:37:12,767 --> 01:37:13,800
Sadly, I'll admit, now is the

2668
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:17,467
Time to split.

2669
01:37:17,467 --> 01:37:19,100
Friends, it is not enough to

2670
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:21,200
Know where you are going.

2671
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:22,233
You also need to know where you

2672
01:37:22,233 --> 01:37:24,333
Are coming from.

2673
01:37:24,333 --> 01:37:27,500
Today, I go forward to go back.

2674
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:29,100
But before I do, let me leave

2675
01:37:29,100 --> 01:37:31,067
You with this...

2676
01:37:31,733 --> 01:37:33,833
**

2677
01:37:33,833 --> 01:37:34,900
* I got to leave

2678
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:36,500
So I've packed my bag

2679
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:38,600
And I'm goin'

2680
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:40,200
I got a date *

2681
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:41,767
* so don't you ask me to stay

2682
01:37:41,767 --> 01:37:46,067
'Cause I'm showin'

2683
01:37:46,067 --> 01:37:47,567
You were always ready

2684
01:37:47,567 --> 01:37:49,667
For new wizardry *

2685
01:37:49,667 --> 01:37:51,267
* you must have thought

2686
01:37:51,267 --> 01:37:52,833
That miracles came easy to me

2687
01:37:52,833 --> 01:37:54,433
Take what I give you

2688
01:37:54,433 --> 01:37:56,067
And put it up on a shelf *

2689
01:37:56,067 --> 01:37:57,100
* 'cause now it's time

2690
01:37:57,100 --> 01:37:58,133
For this here wiz

2691
01:37:58,133 --> 01:38:00,233
To wiz on herself

2692
01:38:00,233 --> 01:38:04,433
And I'm wizin' *

2693
01:38:04,433 --> 01:38:06,067
* give me a reason

2694
01:38:06,067 --> 01:38:07,633
Why I should stay

2695
01:38:07,633 --> 01:38:10,267
And I'll judge it

2696
01:38:10,267 --> 01:38:13,400
My mind is made up *

2697
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:15,067
* so nothin' you say's

2698
01:38:15,067 --> 01:38:17,633
Gonna budge it

2699
01:38:17,633 --> 01:38:19,233
Y 'all copped a whole lot of

2700
01:38:19,233 --> 01:38:21,867
Magic from me *

2701
01:38:21,867 --> 01:38:23,433
* but this the greatest magic

2702
01:38:23,433 --> 01:38:24,500
That you'll ever see

2703
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:25,567
If you blink more than

2704
01:38:25,567 --> 01:38:26,600
One time *

2705
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:28,733
* the kid will be gone

2706
01:38:28,733 --> 01:38:30,867
And you will have to hook up

2707
01:38:30,867 --> 01:38:32,467
The rest on your own

2708
01:38:32,467 --> 01:38:33,500
And do you know *

2709
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:36,133
* what I think about that

2710
01:38:36,133 --> 01:38:41,933
Your work's cut out for you

2711
01:38:41,933 --> 01:38:45,267
It's not about

2712
01:38:45,267 --> 01:38:46,300
Ifs, buts or ands *

2713
01:38:46,300 --> 01:38:47,367
* 'cause when I leave

2714
01:38:47,367 --> 01:38:48,933
This town

2715
01:38:48,933 --> 01:38:50,533
I'm leaving it all in

2716
01:38:50,533 --> 01:38:51,600
Your hands *

2717
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:52,667
* I packed all my clothes

2718
01:38:52,667 --> 01:38:53,733
And I packed up my power

2719
01:38:53,733 --> 01:38:54,767
I'm leavin' this place *

2720
01:38:54,767 --> 01:38:55,300
* in less than

2721
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:56,900
One half an hour

2722
01:38:56,900 --> 01:38:59,067
If you look up in the sky

2723
01:38:59,067 --> 01:39:00,600
You'll know just who it is *

2724
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:02,167
* it's not a bird or a plane

2725
01:39:02,167 --> 01:39:04,267
It's just a little ole wiz

2726
01:39:04,267 --> 01:39:05,833
And guess who's on

2727
01:39:05,833 --> 01:39:07,967

Y'all got it!

2746
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:47,533
And now, Dorothy, it's time to

2747
01:39:47,533 --> 01:39:48,567
Fly!

2748
01:39:48,567 --> 01:39:49,633
Dorothy!

2749
01:39:49,633 --> 01:39:53,333
Quick!

2750
01:39:53,333 --> 01:39:55,433
No.

2751
01:39:55,433 --> 01:39:56,500
Wait!

2752
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:57,533
I don't belong in Omaha.

2753
01:39:57,533 --> 01:39:58,600
What?

2754
01:39:58,600 --> 01:39:59,633
Dorothy, hurry!

2755
01:39:59,633 --> 01:40:00,667
No.

2756
01:40:00,667 --> 01:40:04,900
Go on, miss wiz.

2757
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:05,433
Are you sure?

2758
01:40:05,433 --> 01:40:06,500
I'm sure.

2759
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:11,767
Goodbye.

2760
01:40:11,767 --> 01:40:12,833
Goodbye.

2761
01:40:12,833 --> 01:40:13,867
But, Dorothy, that was your

2762
01:40:13,867 --> 01:40:15,467
Ride home.

2763
01:40:15,467 --> 01:40:16,533
That's what I thought, but I

2764
01:40:16,533 --> 01:40:24,967
Couldn't have been more wrong.

2765
01:40:24,967 --> 01:40:30,033
Addaperle!

2766
01:40:30,033 --> 01:40:32,800
Dorothy Gale, what are you

2767
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:35,500
Still doing here?

2768
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:37,633
You joined the circus?

2769
01:40:37,633 --> 01:40:45,767
These are my friends.

2770
01:40:45,767 --> 01:40:47,767
You figured it out, didn't

2771
01:40:47,767 --> 01:40:50,167
You?

2772
01:40:50,167 --> 01:40:51,033
I think so.

2773
01:40:51,033 --> 01:40:52,033
Omaha was the place I was born.

2774
01:40:52,033 --> 01:40:53,100
But my home, the place I belong,

2775
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:54,133
Is with aunt em in Kansas.

2776
01:40:54,133 --> 01:40:55,200
Is that right?

2777
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:56,267
Good girl.

2778
01:40:56,267 --> 01:40:57,300
Home isn't where you live.

2779
01:40:57,300 --> 01:40:58,900
It's where you love.

2780
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:01,067
I'm so proud of you.

2781
01:41:01,067 --> 01:41:02,067
Does that mean I can go back

2782
01:41:02,067 --> 01:41:03,100
Now?

2783
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:04,167
Can you take me, please?

2784
01:41:04,167 --> 01:41:08,433
Me?

2785
01:41:08,433 --> 01:41:10,100
Oh, no, no, no.

2786
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:11,133
Out of my juris-prudence.

2787
01:41:11,133 --> 01:41:33,833
But I may know someone who can.

2788
01:41:33,833 --> 01:41:36,467
Oh, she's beautiful!

2789
01:41:36,467 --> 01:41:37,533
Did I lie?

2790
01:41:37,533 --> 01:41:39,100
Dorothy, this is my sister

2791
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:40,667
Glinda, the good witch of the

2792
01:41:40,667 --> 01:41:42,800
South.

2793
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:46,500
Hello, Dorothy.

2794
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:48,600
A pleasure to see you up close

2795
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:50,200
Instead of from far away.

2796
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:52,833
From far away?

2797
01:41:52,833 --> 01:41:54,400
I've had my eye on you every

2798
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:56,567
Step of the way.

2799
01:41:56,567 --> 01:41:58,100
I think I already knew that.

2800
01:41:58,100 --> 01:41:59,667
I always felt someone watching

2801
01:41:59,667 --> 01:42:00,733
Over me.

2802
01:42:00,733 --> 01:42:01,767
That's the power of love,

2803
01:42:01,767 --> 01:42:02,800
Baby.

2804
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:05,467
You are never alone.

2805
01:42:05,467 --> 01:42:07,067
Your aunt em and so many others

2806
01:42:07,067 --> 01:42:14,300
Are keepin' watch on you.

2807
01:42:14,300 --> 01:42:16,200
I'm really tired.

2808
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:16,933
Would it be all right if I went

2809
01:42:16,933 --> 01:42:17,800
Back home now?

2810
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:18,867
You've had the power to go

2811
01:42:18,867 --> 01:42:20,433
Home anytime.

2812
01:42:20,433 --> 01:42:21,500
Addaperle, why didn't you tell

2813
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:24,100
The child?

2814
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:25,167
I thought maybe she'd like to

2815
01:42:25,167 --> 01:42:29,700
Meet you first.

2816
01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:31,500
It's these shoes, right?

2817
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:32,567
They have the magic to send me

2818
01:42:32,567 --> 01:42:33,600
Home.

2819
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:37,467
No, darling.

2820
01:42:37,467 --> 01:42:44,900
The magic is inside you.

2821
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:46,333
The magic's in you.

2822
01:42:47,533 --> 01:42:49,633
**

2823
01:42:49,633 --> 01:42:51,200
* if you believe

2824
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:52,267
Within your heart you'll know

2825
01:42:52,267 --> 01:42:55,433
That no one can change

2826
01:42:55,433 --> 01:43:02,833
The path you must go *

2827
01:43:02,833 --> 01:43:08,067
* believe what you feel

2828
01:43:08,067 --> 01:43:11,867
And know you're right

2829
01:43:11,867 --> 01:43:14,667
Because the time will

2830
01:43:14,667 --> 01:43:19,967
Come around *

2831
01:43:19,967 --> 01:43:27,900
* when you say it's yours

2832
01:43:27,900 --> 01:43:32,600
Believe that you can go home

2833
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:35,267
Believe you can float

2834
01:43:35,267 --> 01:43:38,433
On air *

2835
01:43:38,433 --> 01:43:40,533
* then click your heels

2836
01:43:40,533 --> 01:43:45,833
Three times

2837
01:43:45,833 --> 01:43:48,467
If you believe, oh

2838
01:43:48,467 --> 01:43:55,300
Then you'll be there *

2839
01:43:55,300 --> 01:43:57,933
* believe in yourself

2840
01:43:57,933 --> 01:44:01,633
Right from the start

2841
01:44:01,633 --> 01:44:04,833
Believe in the magic

2842
01:44:04,833 --> 01:44:07,433
Right there in your heart *

2843
01:44:07,433 --> 01:44:10,100
* believe all these things

2844
01:44:10,100 --> 01:44:16,933
Not because I told you to

2845
01:44:16,933 --> 01:44:24,300
But believe in yourself

2846
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:29,600
Believe in yourself *

2847
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:33,833
* believe in yourself

2848
01:44:33,833 --> 01:44:46,333
As I believe in you *

2849
01:44:50,700 --> 01:44:56,500
Thank you.

2850
01:44:56,500 --> 01:45:00,200
Remember... click your heels

2851
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:01,833
Together three times and think

2852
01:45:01,833 --> 01:45:08,133
Of home.

2853
01:45:08,133 --> 01:45:11,333
Come along, addaperle.

2854
01:45:11,333 --> 01:45:12,900
We got a lot of catching up to

2855
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:13,933
Do.

2856
01:45:13,933 --> 01:45:15,533
Goodbye, Dorothy.

2857
01:45:15,533 --> 01:45:17,633
Goodbye, Dorothy.

2858
01:45:17,633 --> 01:45:19,767
Goodbye, addaperle.

2859
01:45:19,767 --> 01:45:21,867
Thank you, glinda.

2860
01:45:21,867 --> 01:45:26,633
Goodbye.

2861
01:45:26,633 --> 01:45:27,667
Could that be all there is to

2862
01:45:27,667 --> 01:45:29,800
It?

2863
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:31,900
You just click your heels

2864
01:45:31,900 --> 01:45:33,467
Together three times and you're

2865
01:45:33,467 --> 01:45:34,533
Home?

2866
01:45:34,533 --> 01:45:35,600
It makes no sense, so it must

2867
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:37,200
Be so.

2868
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:40,867
The truth is like that.

2869
01:45:40,867 --> 01:45:41,900
But if you'd known before you

2870
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:42,967
Wouldn't have had to battle

2871
01:45:42,967 --> 01:45:44,533
Evillene or argue with the wiz

2872
01:45:44,533 --> 01:45:46,667
Or even meet me.

2873
01:45:46,667 --> 01:45:47,700
Or me.

2874
01:45:47,700 --> 01:45:50,867
Or me.

2875
01:45:50,867 --> 01:45:52,967
Oh, I wouldn't have missed

2876
01:45:52,967 --> 01:45:56,667
Meeting you for anything.

2877
01:45:56,667 --> 01:46:02,433
Promise that you'll remember me.

2878
01:46:02,433 --> 01:46:09,333
Keep me in your heart.

2879
01:46:09,333 --> 01:46:11,400
And let me, now and then, come

2880
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:18,300
To mind.

2881
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:23,267
And maybe, just maybe, if I hang

2882
01:46:23,267 --> 01:46:25,133
On to these shoes, they'll

2883
01:46:25,133 --> 01:46:26,200
Lead me back to you someday.

2884
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:28,867
Oh, please try.

2885
01:46:28,867 --> 01:46:30,600
I will.

2886
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:32,167
But right now, I think I hear

2887
01:46:32,167 --> 01:46:34,167
Aunt em calling.

2888
01:46:35,333 --> 01:46:36,900
**

2889
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:37,967
* when I think of home

2890
01:46:37,967 --> 01:46:39,567
I think of a place

2891
01:46:39,567 --> 01:46:40,633
Where there's love

2892
01:46:40,633 --> 01:46:44,333
Overflowing *

2893
01:46:44,333 --> 01:46:46,433
* I wish I was home

2894
01:46:46,433 --> 01:46:48,067
I wish I was back there

2895
01:46:48,067 --> 01:46:50,667
With the things I've been

2896
01:46:50,667 --> 01:46:53,800
Knowing *

2897
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:55,400
* wind that makes the

2898
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:57,067
Tall grass

2899
01:46:57,067 --> 01:46:59,100
Bend into leaning *

2900
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:00,167
* suddenly the raindrops

2901
01:47:00,167 --> 01:47:01,733
That fall

2902
01:47:01,733 --> 01:47:04,367
Have a meaning *

2903
01:47:04,367 --> 01:47:09,667
* sprinkling the scene

2904
01:47:09,667 --> 01:47:15,967
Makes it all clean

2905
01:47:15,967 --> 01:47:18,100
Maybe there's a chance *

2906
01:47:18,100 --> 01:47:20,733
* for me to go back

2907
01:47:20,733 --> 01:47:25,467
Now that I have some direction

2908
01:47:25,467 --> 01:47:27,567
It sure would be nice to be

2909
01:47:27,567 --> 01:47:29,700
Back home *

2910
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:31,800
* where there's love and

2911
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:34,933
Affection

2912
01:47:34,933 --> 01:47:37,067
And just maybe I can

2913
01:47:37,067 --> 01:47:39,167
Convince time *

2914
01:47:39,167 --> 01:47:40,733
* to slow up

2915
01:47:40,733 --> 01:47:41,800
Giving me enough time

2916
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:42,833
In my life

2917
01:47:42,833 --> 01:47:46,067
To grow up *

2918
01:47:46,067 --> 01:47:50,733
* time, be my friend

2919
01:47:50,733 --> 01:47:57,067
Let me start again

2920
01:47:57,067 --> 01:47:59,700
Suddenly my world's gone

2921
01:47:59,700 --> 01:48:02,367
And changed its face *

2922
01:48:02,367 --> 01:48:03,900
* but still I know where

2923
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:07,067
I'm going

2924
01:48:07,067 --> 01:48:09,733
I have had my mind

2925
01:48:09,733 --> 01:48:11,833
Spun around in space *

2926
01:48:11,833 --> 01:48:13,400
* and yet I've watched it

2927
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:17,133
Growing

2928
01:48:17,133 --> 01:48:19,200
And if you're listening God

2929
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:20,267
Please don't make it *

2930
01:48:20,267 --> 01:48:21,833
* hard to know

2931
01:48:21,833 --> 01:48:22,900
If we should believe

2932
01:48:22,900 --> 01:48:25,533
The things we see *

2933
01:48:25,533 --> 01:48:27,133
* tell us

2934
01:48:27,133 --> 01:48:28,200
Would we try and stay

2935
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:30,300
Or should we run away

2936
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:31,867
Or is it better *

2937
01:48:31,867 --> 01:48:35,567
* just to let things be

2938
01:48:35,567 --> 01:48:38,200
Living here in this

2939
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:41,367
Brand new world

2940
01:48:41,367 --> 01:48:46,100
Might be a fantasy *

2941
01:48:46,100 --> 01:48:51,367
* but it's taught me to love

2942
01:48:51,367 --> 01:48:56,600
So it's real to me

2943
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:59,233
And I learned that we must

2944
01:48:59,233 --> 01:49:03,967
Look inside our hearts *

2945
01:49:03,967 --> 01:49:06,067
* to find a world

2946
01:49:06,067 --> 01:49:08,700
Full of love *

2947
01:49:08,700 --> 01:49:10,267
* like yours

2948
01:49:10,267 --> 01:49:15,567
Like mine

2949
01:49:15,567 --> 01:49:28,067
Like home **

2950
01:49:30,333 --> 01:49:35,267
Toto, aunt em!
