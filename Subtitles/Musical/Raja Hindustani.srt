1
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:33,736
lt's amazing! Your birthday and
your daughter's birthday...

2
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:35,013
...fall on the same day.

3
00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:39,148
Yes. And we celebrate
our birthdays together...

4
00:04:39,386 --> 00:04:41,479
...on the same day
every year.

5
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:43,488
Where's Mrs. Sehgal?

6
00:04:48,595 --> 00:04:52,258
There are people
who want to meet you.

7
00:04:56,837 --> 00:04:57,895
This is my brother.

8
00:04:58,338 --> 00:05:04,641
This is my nephew, Jai...

9
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,241
And who's she?

10
00:05:12,552 --> 00:05:14,281
Ah! Aarti...

11
00:06:28,328 --> 00:06:31,354
Looking at your figure,
it doesn't appear...

12
00:06:31,732 --> 00:06:33,666
...that you' re the mother
of such a grown-up girl.

13
00:06:34,968 --> 00:06:37,129
Who told you that
l' m her mother?

14
00:06:37,704 --> 00:06:39,194
l' m only her stepmother.

15
00:06:40,841 --> 00:06:44,242
But my sister loves Aarti more
than her real mother would.

16
00:06:47,214 --> 00:06:52,709
- lsn't Aunt a bit foolish?
- Not a bit. She's very foolish.

17
00:06:58,391 --> 00:07:02,589
- You want to go to Palankhet?
- What's there to laugh about?

18
00:07:03,697 --> 00:07:06,427
People go to see America
and Europe, whereas...

19
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:10,667
...you want to visit a tiny
hill-station like Palankhet?

20
00:07:11,304 --> 00:07:14,364
Why don't you go to
Switzerland instead?

21
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:18,977
Because what l can find at Palankhet,
l cannot find elsewhere.

22
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:23,606
- What's so special at Palankhet?
- My mother's memories.

23
00:07:25,118 --> 00:07:29,145
Father...didn't you meet mother for
the first time at Palankhet?

24
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:32,522
Look... it is Shalini now
who is your mother.

25
00:07:32,993 --> 00:07:35,223
Forget the one who is dead.

26
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:40,225
Let her go if she wishes to.

27
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:43,166
Besides, aren't you visiting
Germany for a few days, too?

28
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,700
Yes....when do you
wish to leave?

29
00:07:46,873 --> 00:07:48,738
When are you leaving
for Germany, Father?

30
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:50,135
l' m leaving tomorrow itself.

31
00:07:50,644 --> 00:07:53,408
All right. Then l' ll
also leave tomorrow.

32
00:07:53,747 --> 00:07:56,147
But l cannot permit you
to go all alone.

33
00:07:56,716 --> 00:08:00,777
What' ll people say? That l let my
young daughter go all by herself?

34
00:08:01,087 --> 00:08:02,384
She's right.

35
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:06,825
Gulab and Kamal... you must
accompany Aarti tomorrow.

36
00:08:07,127 --> 00:08:09,254
- To Switzerland?
- Not Switzerland.

37
00:08:10,363 --> 00:08:12,194
What did you say was
the name of that place?

38
00:08:45,465 --> 00:08:48,923
Had you telephoned the Hotel Taj?

39
00:08:50,036 --> 00:08:51,367
Did you ask them to
send a car?

40
00:08:52,439 --> 00:08:53,770
Has the car arrived then?

41
00:08:55,342 --> 00:08:58,743
What can one say? The hotels
here are all useless.

42
00:08:59,112 --> 00:09:01,307
- Had we telephoned London...
- This is not London.

43
00:09:02,148 --> 00:09:04,912
Will you continue to stare at me,
or do something about it?

44
00:09:06,353 --> 00:09:07,945
There's an only taxi
parked there.

45
00:09:08,355 --> 00:09:10,346
lf we miss that one too,
we' ll be stranded here.

46
00:09:10,957 --> 00:09:15,155
She's right... Please stay here.
We' ll go and fetch the taxi.

47
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:24,396
- Raja Hindustani.
- Raja Hindustani...?

48
00:09:24,804 --> 00:09:27,705
The license number is 420
(as in cheats ).

49
00:09:28,408 --> 00:09:31,707
Anyway, what does it have got
to do with us? Come on...

50
00:09:39,986 --> 00:09:44,355
These people are very lazy.
He's taking a nap. What now?

51
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:45,816
l' ll wake him up.

52
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:49,155
- Hey! Wake up!
- Hey! What' re you doing?

53
00:09:49,663 --> 00:09:52,826
- Who' re you?
- l' m the helper on this taxi.

54
00:09:53,566 --> 00:09:55,830
My name is Rajnikant.

55
00:09:57,404 --> 00:10:01,238
Wake your driver. We wish
to go to Palankhet.

56
00:10:01,908 --> 00:10:02,738
We can't go.

57
00:10:03,376 --> 00:10:07,676
- Why can't you?
- The boss sleeps at this hour.

58
00:10:08,448 --> 00:10:12,316
He sleeps at this hour? ls he in
eternal sleep that he can't wake up?

59
00:10:12,652 --> 00:10:15,416
Hold one leg.
l' ll hold the other.

60
00:10:16,189 --> 00:10:18,680
Let's see how he doesn't wake up.
Come on...Get up!

61
00:10:19,025 --> 00:10:23,519
Wake up, O descendent
of the demons!

62
00:10:32,939 --> 00:10:39,344
O descendent of the demons?!
What do you think of yourself?

63
00:10:48,922 --> 00:10:51,015
Who dared wake up the
lndian King of Hearts!?

64
00:10:52,492 --> 00:10:54,858
- Not me, Boss. They did.
- These people?

65
00:10:57,764 --> 00:11:00,892
Who addressed me as a descendant
of the demons?

66
00:11:01,334 --> 00:11:03,461
- Not me, Boss. They did.
- They did?

67
00:11:05,071 --> 00:11:08,268
- Who thumped my cab?
- Not me. They did.

68
00:11:08,675 --> 00:11:09,642
They did?

69
00:11:14,814 --> 00:11:16,509
Aren't you ashamed of raising
your hand on a woman?

70
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:19,248
Woman? ls she a woman?

71
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:22,882
- What else? Can't you see?
- And who' re you? Her sister?

72
00:11:23,957 --> 00:11:30,487
l' m male. My name is Gulab Singh.
She's Kamal, a female.

73
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:36,135
Everything is wrong here. Hot is
cold and cold is hot.

74
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,061
- Don't you know about them?
- About whom?

75
00:11:52,118 --> 00:11:55,815
Shut up, will you? We want a taxi
to take us to Palankhet.

76
00:11:56,556 --> 00:11:57,887
Just tell me if you
will come along.

77
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,684
- No.
- And why not?

78
00:12:01,194 --> 00:12:03,628
l don't feel like it.
l don't want to go.

79
00:12:04,197 --> 00:12:06,859
- Then how' ll we go?
- Put the luggage on your head...

80
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,567
...and walk the distance
of 250 kilometers.

81
00:12:08,935 --> 00:12:10,835
- But just listen...
- Didn't l say no?

82
00:12:13,173 --> 00:12:15,733
- But please listen...
- Didn't l say no?

83
00:12:18,878 --> 00:12:21,972
We' re new here. And there's
no other taxi around, too.

84
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:26,608
Please help us.
You may charge us money.

85
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:28,317
How much would you charge?
500 rupees?

86
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:35,149
All right. Take 600 rupees.

87
00:12:51,211 --> 00:12:53,805
All right. Tell me.
How much will you charge?

88
00:12:55,915 --> 00:12:56,882
Boss...

89
00:12:58,918 --> 00:13:02,649
500 rupees will be enough.

90
00:13:03,022 --> 00:13:04,512
- What?
- Yes.

91
00:13:05,158 --> 00:13:08,321
500 rupees is enough. As it is,
our taxi belongs to Palankhet.

92
00:13:08,728 --> 00:13:11,720
amazing! When l asked you, you refused.

93
00:13:12,232 --> 00:13:14,200
But when Madam asked,
you agreed. Why so?

94
00:13:15,401 --> 00:13:16,493
That's my look-out!

95
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,232
- Fetch Madam's luggage.
- Yes, Boss.

96
00:13:18,771 --> 00:13:20,466
Please come, Madam. Be seated.

97
00:13:22,842 --> 00:13:25,743
- Hey! Where are you going?
- To sit with Madam.

98
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,570
No way. Madam will make herself
comfortable in the rear seat!

99
00:13:28,915 --> 00:13:30,382
- Come on. Let's sit in the front.
- No, not in the front.

100
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,781
My cleaner, Rajnikant,
sits up front with me.

101
00:13:33,186 --> 00:13:35,552
As it is, while driving, sometimes
l shake my hands and legs.

102
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:37,754
- Then where will we sit?
- Yes...where will they sit?

103
00:13:38,158 --> 00:13:41,491
Don't be worried. l've a special
air-conditioned place for them.

104
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:44,963
- Where's that?
- Above.

105
00:13:52,038 --> 00:13:53,767
Looks like he's
going to kill us!

106
00:13:54,674 --> 00:13:58,838
Hold tightly! l think that
this man is crazy

107
00:14:02,615 --> 00:14:03,411
What' re you doing?

108
00:14:11,858 --> 00:14:14,759
Look ahead, Boss! Or you
might cause an accident.

109
00:14:15,128 --> 00:14:15,856
Shut up!

110
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:17,726
- Excuse me...
- Yes, Madam?

111
00:14:18,364 --> 00:14:19,888
How far is Palankhet from here?

112
00:14:20,466 --> 00:14:23,833
28 hours in a bullock cart.
5 hours in a ramshackle bus.

113
00:14:24,337 --> 00:14:27,306
And 3 hours flat in
Raja Hindustani's taxi.

114
00:14:27,907 --> 00:14:32,571
Your name is Raja Hindustani?

115
00:14:32,979 --> 00:14:34,469
Yes. Didn't you like it?

116
00:14:35,014 --> 00:14:38,780
No...it's fine. But its
a bit different, isn't it?

117
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:41,452
Yes, Madam. lt's different.
My name is different from others.

118
00:14:42,021 --> 00:14:43,989
My name is Raja because l' m
the King of my moods.

119
00:14:44,591 --> 00:14:47,253
Nobody can dominate me. And
l' m a Hindustani because...

120
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,391
in this country, you find Hindus,
Sikhs, Christians, Muslims...

121
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:54,826
but no lndians...

122
00:14:55,201 --> 00:15:00,366
l' m an orphan. When l was a kid,
my father passed away.

123
00:15:01,207 --> 00:15:03,266
Now l' m just the child
of my country.

124
00:15:04,043 --> 00:15:05,408
You' re a very interesting
person.

125
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,177
Am l not?

126
00:15:11,017 --> 00:15:11,915
Thank you, Madam.

127
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,463
- What's this?
- Why? Madam?

128
00:15:28,868 --> 00:15:30,893
lt's an English song. People from
the city really enjoy it.

129
00:15:31,771 --> 00:15:34,171
l don't like it.
Switch it off.

130
00:15:35,341 --> 00:15:36,467
Very well, Madam.

131
00:15:50,757 --> 00:15:54,158
- What's this?
- lt's a hit Hindi film song.

132
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:57,830
l don't like that either.
Please switch it off.

133
00:15:58,498 --> 00:16:01,228
All right...

134
00:16:28,861 --> 00:16:30,795
Why did you stop it?

135
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,258
That's a nice song.
Let it play.

136
00:16:35,802 --> 00:16:38,794
lt was not a cassette.
lt was me singing.

137
00:16:39,505 --> 00:16:40,563
- You?
- Yes.

138
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,901
- Do you also sing?
- Yes.

139
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:46,210
- Would you like to hear me?
- Sure.

140
00:22:31,924 --> 00:22:34,484
There's no booking in
your name at this hotel.

141
00:22:35,194 --> 00:22:36,889
How is that possible?

142
00:22:37,496 --> 00:22:39,828
Our booking has been confirmed
at this hotel.

143
00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:42,924
You had telephoned them,
didn't you?

144
00:22:44,336 --> 00:22:46,702
What's this?
Why' re you crying?

145
00:22:48,074 --> 00:22:50,770
l made the booking.
But not for this Taj.

146
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,734
l booked you at the
Taj Mahal in Agra.

147
00:22:53,045 --> 00:22:54,171
What?

148
00:22:55,347 --> 00:22:56,871
Are you out of your mind?

149
00:23:01,587 --> 00:23:04,818
Please book two rooms
for us right now.

150
00:23:05,224 --> 00:23:07,624
There's a conference in
progress right now.

151
00:23:07,993 --> 00:23:10,223
You won't find any accommodation
in the whole of Palanpur.

152
00:23:11,497 --> 00:23:13,260
What should we do now?

153
00:23:13,766 --> 00:23:17,463
- Why' re you worried? Come with me.
- Where?

154
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:20,495
To a place where there are not
just 5-stars, but countless ones.

155
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,869
To a place where one
serves with feelings.

156
00:23:23,943 --> 00:23:26,468
To a place where the doors are open
even if there's no place.

157
00:23:26,812 --> 00:23:28,404
- Come on...
- But Raja...

158
00:23:29,181 --> 00:23:30,546
Where is such a place?

159
00:23:39,925 --> 00:23:44,589
Come along, Madam. Please come...

160
00:23:45,264 --> 00:23:47,732
Look...what a beautiful
place this is!

161
00:23:48,768 --> 00:23:50,895
After all, you did lie!

162
00:23:51,403 --> 00:23:55,032
Even a blind man wouldn't call
this place as five-star.

163
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,910
ls this a hotel or a rest-house?
How can the young lady live here?

164
00:24:00,212 --> 00:24:01,770
Even a donkey wouldn't like
to be tied to such a place.

165
00:24:02,114 --> 00:24:04,344
ln that case, the donkeys might
return to where they come from.

166
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:05,976
You called me a donkey!

167
00:24:06,986 --> 00:24:13,118
Why' re you arguing with him?
lt's a good enough place.

168
00:24:13,626 --> 00:24:15,617
lt's better than the
5-star hotel.

169
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:19,759
ls this somebody's residence?

170
00:24:20,232 --> 00:24:22,200
Yes. lt's the residence of
my Uncle and Aunt.

171
00:24:22,535 --> 00:24:24,560
This taxi too belongs to them.
l only drive it around.

172
00:24:25,204 --> 00:24:27,001
- Are they your blood relatives?
- No.

173
00:24:27,473 --> 00:24:29,407
lt's not blood that ties us
together, but our hearts.

174
00:24:29,742 --> 00:24:32,404
You know how we lndians form
a relationship everywhere.

175
00:24:32,978 --> 00:24:35,708
My relationship with Uncle and
Auntie too is a similar one.

176
00:24:36,148 --> 00:24:38,480
Hurry up! Go and tell Uncle
that Madam has come.

177
00:24:38,951 --> 00:24:39,940
All right.

178
00:24:40,386 --> 00:24:43,150
Also tell them that she has
brought two maidservants along.

179
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:44,847
Hey! What did you say?

180
00:24:50,262 --> 00:24:52,025
What happened? You cut your
hands, didn't you?

181
00:24:52,364 --> 00:24:54,059
- Hey! What' re you doing?
- Why?

182
00:24:54,533 --> 00:24:57,263
People say that if a tigress
tastes blood...

183
00:24:57,636 --> 00:24:58,534
she doesn't spare
anybody alive.

184
00:24:58,904 --> 00:25:01,532
Really? So l' m a tigress, eh?
And what' re you?

185
00:25:02,107 --> 00:25:03,165
l' m a sheep.

186
00:25:05,277 --> 00:25:10,476
- You've come?
- Yes. Boss too has come.

187
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,374
He has brought
along a madam too.

188
00:25:13,252 --> 00:25:14,276
A Madam...?

189
00:25:15,754 --> 00:25:17,346
A madam with Raja?

190
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:21,384
Let me go and see which Madam
Raja has brought along.

191
00:25:23,662 --> 00:25:26,631
You' re very beautiful.
What's your name?

192
00:25:27,199 --> 00:25:29,827
- Aarti.
- Ah! What a lovely name!

193
00:25:30,202 --> 00:25:31,692
Yes, it's a lovely name.

194
00:25:32,605 --> 00:25:35,472
You may stay here for
as long as you wish.

195
00:25:35,908 --> 00:25:37,307
You don't have to go
to any hotel.

196
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,503
- Come on.
- Please come, Madam.

197
00:25:41,013 --> 00:25:43,504
Go and get the luggage.
And you, maidservants...

198
00:25:43,816 --> 00:25:44,510
Go and help him.

199
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:45,848
Please come, Madam.

200
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:50,579
Just a minute.

201
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,484
l'd forgotten.

202
00:25:54,627 --> 00:25:56,492
She's my wife.

203
00:25:57,162 --> 00:25:59,824
And this poor man is my husband.
He's performing his duties.

204
00:26:01,367 --> 00:26:03,927
Uncle and Auntie are always
pulling each other's leg.

205
00:26:04,403 --> 00:26:07,133
Why' re you standing far away?
Come closer.

206
00:26:12,478 --> 00:26:13,877
- Greetings.
- Bless you.

207
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:19,276
- What' re you doing?
- Guests stand for good fortune.

208
00:26:19,818 --> 00:26:22,286
How can good fortune enter the
house without a welcome?

209
00:26:22,688 --> 00:26:24,155
Yes, of course.

210
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,189
Hey!

211
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,841
Why did you throw water on me?

212
00:27:53,345 --> 00:27:56,906
l couldn't help it. After all,
it was only a hand. lt shook.

213
00:27:57,583 --> 00:28:00,245
The day my hand shakes, your
brains will start shaking.

214
00:28:00,686 --> 00:28:02,449
lt's your mind which
is wavering, Boss!

215
00:28:03,288 --> 00:28:06,223
- What did you say?
- Whom were you gazing at?

216
00:28:07,493 --> 00:28:12,760
l was admiring the morning....the
Sun that shines so brightly!

217
00:28:13,966 --> 00:28:15,957
But the sun rises
in that direction.

218
00:28:16,368 --> 00:28:17,995
When did it get to rise
in this direction?

219
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,803
You' re getting to be
too smart nowadays.

220
00:28:20,372 --> 00:28:25,503
- Want a beating?
- For your beautiful Sun's sake!

221
00:28:28,047 --> 00:28:29,981
Well...wash the car
properly today.

222
00:28:30,449 --> 00:28:32,212
l must take madam
to the market today.

223
00:28:33,118 --> 00:28:34,415
Please come.

224
00:28:35,054 --> 00:28:38,683
Look at this beautiful
taxi-stand of Palanpur.

225
00:28:39,058 --> 00:28:42,721
She hasn't come here from Mumbai
just to see a taxi-stand.

226
00:28:43,062 --> 00:28:45,394
Hey! This taxi-stand is
our bread-earner.

227
00:28:45,764 --> 00:28:48,392
lf you criticize it, l' ll punch
your ears and nose together!

228
00:28:49,034 --> 00:28:50,160
What's this?

229
00:28:50,936 --> 00:28:55,100
What's going on? Come on...
let's go and see something else.

230
00:28:55,474 --> 00:28:57,339
All right...as you wish.

231
00:28:57,876 --> 00:29:02,210
Wait a minute...you can't leave
without meeting my dearest friend.

232
00:29:02,347 --> 00:29:04,338
Hey there!

233
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:05,942
Who is it?

234
00:29:06,852 --> 00:29:09,480
Raja! My friend!

235
00:29:10,656 --> 00:29:12,317
My dear friend!

236
00:29:46,191 --> 00:29:49,058
Madam! This is my friend!

237
00:29:50,762 --> 00:29:52,320
My dearest friend.

238
00:29:52,865 --> 00:29:54,127
He's the president
of this taxi-union.

239
00:29:54,967 --> 00:29:59,063
And this is madam!
She's come from Mumbai.

240
00:29:59,705 --> 00:30:01,764
Greetings. Please come in.
Let me serve you refreshments.

241
00:30:03,242 --> 00:30:04,641
l've got some shopping to do.

242
00:30:05,144 --> 00:30:07,772
Yes...l've got to help her
with the shopping.

243
00:30:08,213 --> 00:30:10,647
But please treat the two of
them. l' m going with madam.

244
00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:15,213
Sure. You can sit with me and
enjoy some refreshments!

245
00:30:15,888 --> 00:30:16,946
Meanwhile, l' ll do some shopping.

246
00:30:17,456 --> 00:30:19,788
Don't you worry.

247
00:30:22,561 --> 00:30:23,653
How' re you related to Madam?

248
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,692
l' m her body-guard.

249
00:30:28,033 --> 00:30:30,263
You' re a robust body-guard.
Why don't you embrace me too?

250
00:30:32,204 --> 00:30:33,603
Leave me! Leave me!

251
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,067
- Scoundrel!
- Just a minute.

252
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,978
- Let me go!
- You' re all right.

253
00:30:40,412 --> 00:30:43,813
- Just once more.
- Leave me!

254
00:30:46,118 --> 00:30:47,016
There's something wrong.

255
00:30:48,187 --> 00:30:49,347
Please come inside.

256
00:30:51,823 --> 00:30:54,189
Please come in.
Sit there. Sit here.

257
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,459
Bring two glasses of
some great butter-milk!

258
00:30:58,864 --> 00:31:02,493
lt's so warm. Come on...
Take off your sweater.

259
00:31:03,368 --> 00:31:07,168
- lt's so warm. Take it off.
- Let me go. l won't remove it.

260
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:09,063
Why not? l' ll remove it for you.

261
00:31:09,808 --> 00:31:13,335
Strange! A brave man takes off
his dress at the drop of a hat!

262
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,010
But he's feeling shy
as if he were a girl!

263
00:31:15,681 --> 00:31:17,410
She is a girl. Wouldn't she
feel shy like a girl then?

264
00:31:18,817 --> 00:31:19,784
Are you a girl?

265
00:31:21,253 --> 00:31:22,777
That's why l was wondered...

266
00:31:23,155 --> 00:31:26,124
why bells rang in my mind
everytime l touched you!

267
00:31:26,525 --> 00:31:29,187
Beware! Don't you
call me a girl!

268
00:31:38,604 --> 00:31:41,095
This is Aarti speaking.

269
00:31:42,007 --> 00:31:44,840
- Yes...?
- Pass on the phone to father.

270
00:31:45,377 --> 00:31:47,208
He hasn't yet returned
from Germany.

271
00:31:47,713 --> 00:31:50,045
- When will he return?
- ln a few days time.

272
00:31:50,649 --> 00:31:52,412
lf he telephones, please
tell him that...

273
00:31:52,751 --> 00:31:56,448
l' m not staying at the Taj, but
with a very nice couple.

274
00:31:57,089 --> 00:32:00,354
- Their address is...
- Fax your address to us.

275
00:32:05,797 --> 00:32:10,757
Whether she lives at the Taj, or
elsewhere, why must l bother?

276
00:32:11,069 --> 00:32:12,559
l disconnected the phone.

277
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:16,667
You' re an expert in
faking the act, Sister.

278
00:32:17,075 --> 00:32:20,044
l've learnt from none
other than you, Brother.

279
00:32:20,612 --> 00:32:23,843
Well said...if you continue to
follow my directions...

280
00:32:24,283 --> 00:32:27,775
the whole property will be
transferred to our name one day.

281
00:32:29,087 --> 00:32:30,952
And what about Aarti?

282
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,983
Her problem will be
solved by itself.

283
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:39,422
Just a minute, Madam.

284
00:32:41,767 --> 00:32:44,235
- Take this, Madam.
- What is it?

285
00:32:44,836 --> 00:32:47,134
- Please keep it.
- But what is it?

286
00:32:47,739 --> 00:32:51,800
Shopkeepers here give guides a
commission for bringing customers.

287
00:32:52,144 --> 00:32:53,270
This is my commission.

288
00:32:53,612 --> 00:32:55,079
You may keep it. You' re
entitled to it.

289
00:32:55,447 --> 00:32:57,779
No, Madam. How can l take
commission from your money?

290
00:32:58,083 --> 00:32:59,414
Please keep it.

291
00:33:01,787 --> 00:33:03,015
What did you say?

292
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,149
- Are you sure?
- Yes, l' m sure.

293
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,693
What did you say?

294
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:15,228
When l say thank you, you
should say ''you' re welcome'' .

295
00:33:15,934 --> 00:33:16,696
What was that?

296
00:33:17,903 --> 00:33:20,565
- What?
- First say you...

297
00:33:21,373 --> 00:33:23,864
Not Gu...say You.

298
00:33:26,478 --> 00:33:28,878
Never mind. You won't be
able to say it. Let's go.

299
00:33:30,749 --> 00:33:32,614
l won't be able to say it?!
Why won't l be able to say it?

300
00:33:33,018 --> 00:33:34,849
- Come on, Raja.
- Let's go, Madam.

301
00:33:41,493 --> 00:33:42,084
What did she say?

302
00:33:43,962 --> 00:33:45,122
Yes...

303
00:33:58,043 --> 00:33:58,839
Boss...

304
00:34:00,011 --> 00:34:02,002
- What is it?
- You' re doing it without reason.

305
00:34:02,647 --> 00:34:05,309
- Nothing's going to happen.
- Just get lost!

306
00:34:05,917 --> 00:34:10,081
lt's your time to get lost.
Madam has been asking for you.

307
00:34:10,789 --> 00:34:14,555
What? Has Madam asked for me?
That's wonderful!

308
00:34:23,034 --> 00:34:26,265
Madam....you asked for me?

309
00:34:26,805 --> 00:34:31,902
l've got such a nice place
to live in, thanks to you.

310
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,108
You've showed me
around the whole town,...

311
00:34:33,445 --> 00:34:34,434
helped me in the shopping...

312
00:34:34,813 --> 00:34:36,474
and you didn't even
collect your commission.

313
00:34:37,015 --> 00:34:38,505
That was only my duty, Madam.

314
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:43,217
But you didn't even ask for
any money. Why?

315
00:34:43,722 --> 00:34:47,089
here's the hurry?
l' m here. And you' re here too...

316
00:34:47,526 --> 00:34:49,221
You' ll be here for
a few days, won't you?

317
00:34:49,594 --> 00:34:53,792
- Still...take this.
- But this is too much, Madam.

318
00:34:54,232 --> 00:34:56,029
l've asked Rajnikant
for the accounts.

319
00:34:56,802 --> 00:34:58,861
This 800 rupees is for the taxi.

320
00:35:00,105 --> 00:35:04,371
And this 200 rupees
is your tip.

321
00:35:07,813 --> 00:35:09,303
- My tip?
- Yes.

322
00:35:10,682 --> 00:35:12,172
How can l accept
any tips from you?

323
00:35:12,818 --> 00:35:13,682
Why not?

324
00:35:15,053 --> 00:35:16,748
- l can't accept it.
- Why not?

325
00:35:18,256 --> 00:35:20,850
You can accept it from others,
and why not from me?

326
00:35:22,627 --> 00:35:24,754
Are you feeling shy?

327
00:35:26,832 --> 00:35:28,356
ls this less?
Do you want some more?

328
00:35:31,236 --> 00:35:34,296
Take it, l say...
Keep it!

329
00:35:39,377 --> 00:35:41,641
All right. You may go now.

330
00:35:46,017 --> 00:35:50,181
Yes...?

331
00:36:01,366 --> 00:36:04,927
- Fool!
- Don't worry. l' m with you.

332
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:11,137
Let me speak.

333
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,639
- Hey! Raja!
- What is it?

334
00:36:14,513 --> 00:36:16,504
Come...we want to go
to the market.

335
00:36:16,982 --> 00:36:17,949
l don't want to go
to the market.

336
00:36:18,383 --> 00:36:21,147
- Why not?
- The boss is in a foul mood.

337
00:36:21,553 --> 00:36:25,785
Foul mood, my foot! There's nothing
wrong with the car, is there?

338
00:36:26,157 --> 00:36:27,522
Didn't l say that l won't
go to the market?

339
00:36:27,926 --> 00:36:30,952
Are you doing us a favor? Haven't
we paid you for the cab?

340
00:36:31,296 --> 00:36:32,627
- You, there!
- Just a minute.

341
00:36:33,098 --> 00:36:35,532
The madam has paid me.
l' m answerable only to her!

342
00:36:35,901 --> 00:36:37,095
not to her servants!

343
00:36:38,436 --> 00:36:40,529
Look at how he uses
his tongue!

344
00:36:41,406 --> 00:36:42,566
You there!

345
00:36:43,508 --> 00:36:47,308
lf the boss gives you a punch,
you' ll begin shaking terribly.

346
00:36:48,346 --> 00:36:49,745
Don't you dare touch him!

347
00:36:50,682 --> 00:36:52,274
lf l go and complain
to madam...

348
00:36:52,651 --> 00:36:55,245
How dare you try to scare me
by using her name!

349
00:36:55,554 --> 00:36:57,044
Go and complain to her!
l' m not scared of her.

350
00:36:57,489 --> 00:37:00,515
- You aren't scared?
- We' re not scared.

351
00:37:04,563 --> 00:37:06,326
Leave them. Let's go.

352
00:37:08,366 --> 00:37:10,129
- Not like this.
- How else?

353
00:37:11,202 --> 00:37:14,069
What? Does Madam
praise me a lot?

354
00:37:14,706 --> 00:37:17,368
l suppose you aren't
playing some mischief.

355
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:20,275
We swear.

356
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:22,237
Why would we lie?

357
00:37:22,714 --> 00:37:27,674
- l swear upon this little one.
- Don't you swear upon me.

358
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:31,384
Just listen to all that
the madam says about you.

359
00:37:32,324 --> 00:37:33,621
Really? What does madam say?

360
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:36,721
Madam says that Raja is
so handsome!

361
00:37:37,128 --> 00:37:38,095
- ls it?
- Boss...

362
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,488
Just shut up...what else
does madam say?

363
00:37:39,965 --> 00:37:43,924
She praises your singing,
walking and laughing.

364
00:37:44,703 --> 00:37:46,603
- ls it?
- But l regret...

365
00:37:46,972 --> 00:37:47,870
What do you regret?

366
00:37:48,473 --> 00:37:49,531
- Must l tell him?
- Go ahead.

367
00:37:50,342 --> 00:37:52,970
She says that everything about
Raja is nice.

368
00:37:53,311 --> 00:37:55,245
But neither does he have
class, nor style.

369
00:37:56,481 --> 00:37:57,209
What's that?

370
00:37:58,183 --> 00:38:03,678
lt about how one walks, talks,
dresses and conducts himself.

371
00:38:04,122 --> 00:38:06,022
One has to play the hero.

372
00:38:06,558 --> 00:38:08,492
The hero? Really?

373
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,321
- Madam likes all that.
- Yes. She digs that.

374
00:38:11,796 --> 00:38:13,855
All right, then. l' ll do that.

375
00:38:14,366 --> 00:38:16,061
l' ll wear nice dresses.
Behave like a hero.

376
00:38:16,368 --> 00:38:17,300
- Boss...
- Shut up...

377
00:38:17,836 --> 00:38:21,795
But l don't know anything.
How will l do it all?

378
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,640
What' re we for?

379
00:38:26,544 --> 00:38:28,034
- Boss...
- You should help me.

380
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:06,667
Did you see Raja's style?

381
00:41:07,272 --> 00:41:10,264
lsn't it classy?

382
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:11,736
Just like a hero!

383
00:41:34,265 --> 00:41:36,165
What's this?

384
00:41:50,181 --> 00:41:52,547
Stop fooling around.

385
00:41:54,986 --> 00:41:56,317
Wait!

386
00:41:58,823 --> 00:42:05,126
But what was the need
to do such foolish things?

387
00:42:05,864 --> 00:42:08,890
Because l am a fool...
a total fool!

388
00:42:10,301 --> 00:42:14,328
But let me tell you something.
Nobody can fool me otherwise.

389
00:42:14,772 --> 00:42:19,106
But they named you,
and l got fooled.

390
00:42:19,677 --> 00:42:25,513
You' re not a fool.
You' re just a simpleton.

391
00:42:26,384 --> 00:42:29,717
You' re a very decent man,
aren't you?

392
00:42:30,088 --> 00:42:32,147
lt's of no use.

393
00:42:32,457 --> 00:42:33,981
Decency and simplicity is
of no use in this world.

394
00:42:35,126 --> 00:42:38,323
People with a clean heart
have no place in this world.

395
00:42:40,565 --> 00:42:43,432
But people with a clean heart
cannot have any worth.

396
00:42:43,768 --> 00:42:46,134
After all, they' re priceless.

397
00:42:47,805 --> 00:42:51,172
How wonderful! You've just
said something so true!

398
00:42:52,677 --> 00:42:56,636
You can't place a price on
clean-hearted people.

399
00:42:57,482 --> 00:43:00,042
- They' re priceless.
- Just like you are.

400
00:43:01,419 --> 00:43:04,820
- Me?
- Yes...you.

401
00:43:09,394 --> 00:43:11,123
Just a minute, Madam.

402
00:43:12,463 --> 00:43:14,522
Give me 200 rupees. Hurry up.

403
00:43:15,533 --> 00:43:17,694
- 200 rupees?
- Keep all of it.

404
00:43:18,036 --> 00:43:19,196
No. Just 200 rupees.

405
00:43:19,837 --> 00:43:22,305
- Here, Madam.
- What is this?

406
00:43:22,807 --> 00:43:25,708
- A tip.
- A tip?

407
00:43:26,044 --> 00:43:29,013
Yes, Madam. That day, you liked
what l said. And you rewarded me.

408
00:43:29,314 --> 00:43:31,578
Today l liked what you said.
So l' m giving you a tip.

409
00:43:31,849 --> 00:43:33,043
The scores are level!

410
00:43:34,052 --> 00:43:36,680
- Please take it, Madam.
- But...

411
00:43:37,155 --> 00:43:38,679
Please take it, Madam.

412
00:43:47,832 --> 00:43:49,094
A tip!?

413
00:43:49,534 --> 00:43:50,899
- Madam!
- What is it?

414
00:44:23,601 --> 00:44:25,728
l like it a lot. Come on,
let's go and tell Baby.

415
00:44:26,404 --> 00:44:27,336
What' re you doing here?

416
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:30,639
Look at the dress.
lt's so beautiful.

417
00:44:31,642 --> 00:44:33,701
lt's a beautiful dress.
lt' ll look good on you.

418
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,345
- Shall l buy it?
- Yes.

419
00:44:38,016 --> 00:44:39,313
- Yes?
- Yes.

420
00:44:40,051 --> 00:44:41,575
Wait here. l' ll be back.

421
00:44:50,862 --> 00:44:53,126
Baby liked it at first sight.

422
00:44:54,098 --> 00:44:56,191
- Where's Madam?
- She's ours.

423
00:44:56,701 --> 00:44:57,929
Why should you be bothered?

424
00:45:04,909 --> 00:45:05,603
You hit me?

425
00:45:40,044 --> 00:45:41,602
How do you find my dress?

426
00:45:54,292 --> 00:45:59,423
Looks like Raja didn't
like my dress.

427
00:45:59,831 --> 00:46:01,799
- Shall l tell you the truth?
- Yes.

428
00:46:02,333 --> 00:46:06,064
l didn't like this dress at all.
l suggest you change it immediately.

429
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:07,860
- lt's not nice.
- This boy is naive.

430
00:46:08,439 --> 00:46:10,873
- What'd he know about fashion?
- Don't pay attention to him.

431
00:46:11,242 --> 00:46:12,436
Let's go and do some
shopping instead.

432
00:46:12,844 --> 00:46:13,936
Come on...

433
00:46:17,281 --> 00:46:22,014
You think a lot. My
dress is very nice.

434
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:00,616
O sweetheart!

435
00:47:02,827 --> 00:47:06,092
lt's so tiny!

436
00:47:06,931 --> 00:47:09,365
Even if you didn't wear it,
you would've looked prettier.

437
00:47:09,967 --> 00:47:10,865
What is it?

438
00:47:12,703 --> 00:47:14,227
Let them say what they want to.

439
00:47:16,374 --> 00:47:19,537
You' re quite a dish!

440
00:47:20,912 --> 00:47:23,142
- Hey!
- Didn't l tell you?

441
00:47:23,614 --> 00:47:26,742
O sweetheart! Are you joining us?

442
00:47:28,219 --> 00:47:30,244
lf you aren't coming,
l' ll come over.

443
00:47:31,322 --> 00:47:33,017
You' re so delicious!

444
00:49:04,482 --> 00:49:05,244
What were you saying?

445
00:49:18,562 --> 00:49:22,999
Scoundrel! How dare you
try to attack Raja!

446
00:49:26,504 --> 00:49:28,802
How dare you confront Boss!

447
00:49:29,707 --> 00:49:33,541
Don't!

448
00:49:34,845 --> 00:49:35,777
Leave him!

449
00:49:46,624 --> 00:49:50,958
Will you kill him?

450
00:50:12,483 --> 00:50:13,814
What does he think of himself?

451
00:50:14,819 --> 00:50:17,720
Let him come. l' ll deal
with him properly.

452
00:50:18,823 --> 00:50:19,619
Yes, Madam...

453
00:50:22,193 --> 00:50:24,525
l see..so you've come?

454
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:27,989
Why did you have to
create such a scene?

455
00:50:28,699 --> 00:50:30,291
Why did you indulge in
so much of violence?

456
00:50:31,135 --> 00:50:33,330
You made a scene for
such a small thing.

457
00:50:34,405 --> 00:50:35,963
You call it something small.

458
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:39,338
Those scoundrels were teasing you,
abusing you...

459
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:41,741
- and you call it a small thing.
- So what?

460
00:50:42,413 --> 00:50:46,008
Barking dogs can't be helped.
You should've ignored them.

461
00:50:46,517 --> 00:50:48,075
This is a common occurrence
in the cities.

462
00:50:48,486 --> 00:50:50,181
lt must be happening in
the cities, not here.

463
00:50:50,721 --> 00:50:54,088
This is Palankhet. Womenfolk
here are treated with respect.

464
00:50:54,458 --> 00:50:55,789
And those who don't know
how to respect...

465
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:58,254
are kicked several times and
taught how one should respect.

466
00:50:58,929 --> 00:51:02,592
l see...so you've taken it
upon yourself to reform society!

467
00:51:03,167 --> 00:51:05,067
Has the government awarded
you a contract to do this?

468
00:51:05,436 --> 00:51:06,960
How strange! l beat them up
for your sake...

469
00:51:07,338 --> 00:51:08,327
...and you' re scolding me!

470
00:51:08,973 --> 00:51:10,133
Listen to one more thing.

471
00:51:10,674 --> 00:51:12,733
l don't like it at all
when you wear such dresses.

472
00:51:18,516 --> 00:51:22,008
Who' re you to tell me what l should
wear and what l shouldn't?

473
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:23,912
Who' re you?

474
00:51:24,555 --> 00:51:28,616
l' ll do and wear as
l please. Understand?

475
00:51:31,328 --> 00:51:38,257
Yes...who am l to
tell you anything?

476
00:51:38,936 --> 00:51:40,733
You can do as you please.

477
00:51:41,605 --> 00:51:43,539
And l' ll do whatever
l find appropriate.

478
00:51:44,275 --> 00:51:48,336
Wear whatever you like, and l' ll
keep on bashing up people.

479
00:51:48,879 --> 00:51:51,439
Today l've just broken their limbs.
Tomorrow l' ll break their heads.

480
00:51:52,116 --> 00:51:55,517
l am not scared of anybody.
l' m not even scared of you.

481
00:51:56,153 --> 00:51:57,711
Yes. l' m not scared of you!

482
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:10,248
You' re searching for Raja?

483
00:53:11,795 --> 00:53:13,285
l know where you can find him.

484
00:53:14,098 --> 00:53:15,360
Where is he?

485
00:53:17,167 --> 00:53:18,794
You' ll find him
in his own house.

486
00:53:19,803 --> 00:53:22,795
His house?

487
00:53:39,857 --> 00:53:40,983
Shall l come in?

488
00:53:42,059 --> 00:53:44,994
- Who told you about this place?
- Auntie did.

489
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:52,262
Auntie has told me everything.
This is your home, isn't it?

490
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:54,936
The unfulfilled dream
of your parents...

491
00:53:55,439 --> 00:53:56,565
lt's very pretty.

492
00:53:57,107 --> 00:53:59,667
- Why have you come here?
- To ask for your forgiveness.

493
00:54:00,878 --> 00:54:04,405
l spoke a lot of nonsense yesterday
in a fit of anger.

494
00:54:05,015 --> 00:54:06,505
Please forgive me.

495
00:54:07,484 --> 00:54:10,647
Who am l to forgive you?
What right do l have on you?

496
00:54:11,922 --> 00:54:13,913
You' re very angry, aren't you?

497
00:54:14,224 --> 00:54:16,385
All right. Look...l' m
even holding my ears.

498
00:54:16,894 --> 00:54:18,885
Please forgive me now.

499
00:54:20,564 --> 00:54:26,264
Look...if you don't forgive me
right away, l' ll start crying.

500
00:54:27,938 --> 00:54:30,031
Very well...l forgive you.

501
00:54:31,909 --> 00:54:36,243
Hey! You were so angry at me
just a while ago.

502
00:54:36,647 --> 00:54:40,913
And you pardoned me so quickly.
What does it mean?

503
00:54:41,285 --> 00:54:42,616
l cannot see anybody crying.

504
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,011
lf somebody weeps, l too
start weeping.

505
00:54:52,496 --> 00:54:53,224
What does it mean?

506
00:54:54,298 --> 00:54:57,961
lt means...you' re a darling.

507
00:54:58,902 --> 00:55:02,394
Madam...do you know who is
addressed as a darling?

508
00:55:03,574 --> 00:55:06,600
Yes, of course...one who
is close to the heart.

509
00:55:07,044 --> 00:55:09,979
One who is dear, and one
who is the best friend.

510
00:55:10,648 --> 00:55:14,106
- Am l?
- Yes.

511
00:55:15,052 --> 00:55:16,519
- Me, Madam?
- Yes.

512
00:55:17,688 --> 00:55:19,781
- l' m your best friend?
- Gosh!

513
00:55:20,157 --> 00:55:21,647
Stop talking now,
and let's move.

514
00:55:22,393 --> 00:55:26,557
l've decided to see the
whole of Palankhet today.

515
00:55:27,431 --> 00:55:29,797
- Will you show me around?
- Sure, Madam.

516
00:55:30,467 --> 00:55:32,059
l' ll show you the heavens today.

517
00:55:37,841 --> 00:55:38,500
Please come.

518
00:55:39,043 --> 00:55:42,410
- Shall l open my eyes?
- No, not now. Just a minute.

519
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:47,139
- Where have you brought me?
- Please keep walking.

520
00:55:47,618 --> 00:55:48,346
Shall l open my eyes?

521
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:51,781
Yes. Open it now.

522
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:07,496
lt's such a beautiful place.

523
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:11,667
lsn't it beautiful? l knew that
you'd like this place a lot.

524
00:56:12,142 --> 00:56:15,202
Come on...be seated here.

525
00:56:20,084 --> 00:56:21,016
lt's such a nice place.

526
00:56:22,486 --> 00:56:24,977
lt must be here that my
parents had first met.

527
00:56:25,489 --> 00:56:26,751
What did you say?

528
00:56:29,927 --> 00:56:35,422
Do you know...my mother and father
first met at Palankhet.

529
00:56:35,833 --> 00:56:37,460
Your mother..? How is your mother?

530
00:56:38,702 --> 00:56:43,935
She isn't alive. She passed away
soon after l was born.

531
00:56:44,341 --> 00:56:46,241
Amazing! You don't have a mother.
l have no mother too.

532
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:47,440
Both are same.

533
00:56:48,712 --> 00:56:52,045
Pardon me for blabbering like this.
l say anything that comes to my mind.

534
00:56:52,549 --> 00:56:55,143
lt's a problem. l don't
know how to converse.

535
00:56:56,653 --> 00:56:58,416
Who says that you cannot converse?

536
00:56:59,423 --> 00:57:02,256
- You talk very well.
- Really?

537
00:57:03,494 --> 00:57:11,060
Madam...l just talk beautifully.
But you' re beautiful too.

538
00:57:13,003 --> 00:57:15,267
- Me?
- Yes. You' re very beautiful.

539
00:57:15,973 --> 00:57:18,703
You too make a lot of
insincere praises.

540
00:57:19,309 --> 00:57:23,905
l swear...l haven't seen anybody
more beautiful than you are.

541
00:57:24,748 --> 00:57:27,717
Why? What's so
beautiful about me ?

542
00:57:29,219 --> 00:57:30,243
Everything about you is beautiful.

543
00:57:30,821 --> 00:57:31,810
Your hair...

544
00:57:33,991 --> 00:57:34,889
lt's nothing special.

545
00:57:35,926 --> 00:57:39,362
- Your eyes.
- My eyes..?

546
00:57:40,864 --> 00:57:44,095
Come a bit closer.

547
00:57:47,971 --> 00:57:50,132
What's so special
about my eyes?

548
00:57:51,475 --> 00:57:54,342
- Your eyes...
- Yes..my eyes?

549
00:57:55,179 --> 00:57:58,740
- Your eyes...
- Come on. Tell me...

550
00:57:59,116 --> 00:58:00,777
What's so special
about my eyes?

551
00:58:01,752 --> 00:58:04,243
Your eyes are like the
headlight of a taxi-cab.

552
00:58:04,555 --> 00:58:05,715
What?

553
00:58:16,166 --> 00:58:18,691
You' re an idiot! A clown!

554
00:58:19,403 --> 00:58:21,166
But madam! l don't know
poetry. What could l do?

555
00:58:21,638 --> 00:58:24,471
l' m telling you the truth.
No one is more beautiful than you.

556
00:58:24,908 --> 00:58:28,036
That's enough. lf somebody hears
you, he' ll have a nice laugh.

557
00:58:28,412 --> 00:58:30,175
l' m not scared of anybody.
l' ll tell everybody.

558
00:58:30,581 --> 00:58:32,242
This sky...these clouds...
these mountains...

559
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:36,678
Madam is very beautiful.

560
00:58:39,056 --> 00:58:42,116
Madam is the most beautiful.

561
01:05:09,613 --> 01:05:11,774
Be careful, Madam. Hurry up...

562
01:05:47,517 --> 01:05:48,279
Hey!

563
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:53,489
What' re you doing? Why' re you
drenching yourself in the rain?

564
01:05:53,923 --> 01:05:55,356
Come here...under the tree.

565
01:05:56,693 --> 01:05:57,455
No, Madam.

566
01:05:58,895 --> 01:06:02,763
Are you mad? You' ll fall sick.
You' ll catch fever. Come here.

567
01:06:05,035 --> 01:06:05,899
l' m fine here.

568
01:06:08,204 --> 01:06:12,197
Look...if you don't come here
right away, l' ll come out there.

569
01:06:12,776 --> 01:06:15,643
- No, Madam.
- Then come over.

570
01:06:18,315 --> 01:06:22,342
Come...come!

571
01:06:34,097 --> 01:06:36,122
Give me your hand. Come on!

572
01:06:57,620 --> 01:07:00,612
l' m very scared of lightening.

573
01:07:04,027 --> 01:07:06,723
l' m such a fool, aren't l?

574
01:08:43,893 --> 01:08:44,723
No...

575
01:09:10,987 --> 01:09:12,045
No!

576
01:10:14,551 --> 01:10:17,520
Those idiots must've told you
that Daddy has come, did they?

577
01:10:18,521 --> 01:10:19,920
And you...

578
01:10:20,456 --> 01:10:24,517
...came rushing through the storm
and the rains to meet your father?

579
01:10:25,128 --> 01:10:27,358
Yes...

580
01:10:28,131 --> 01:10:32,067
l've come to meet you, my child.

581
01:10:36,005 --> 01:10:38,098
l've come to meet you
straight from Germany.

582
01:10:38,508 --> 01:10:41,204
l haven't even been home.
We' ll go together now.

583
01:10:41,711 --> 01:10:42,700
l' ll take you back.

584
01:10:44,681 --> 01:10:46,581
- Back?
- Yes. Back...

585
01:10:59,395 --> 01:11:02,592
Where had you been?

586
01:11:03,399 --> 01:11:05,390
l was in the storm.

587
01:11:05,868 --> 01:11:07,426
lt's nice that you've come.

588
01:11:07,870 --> 01:11:09,337
Take out the taxi quickly.
Your madam is leaving.

589
01:11:12,976 --> 01:11:16,036
- Madam is leaving.
- Yes.

590
01:11:16,346 --> 01:11:18,814
Her father has come to take her.
She has to leave tonight itself.

591
01:11:19,148 --> 01:11:20,342
They've to board
the morning flight.

592
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:22,615
What' re you still standing for?
Get the car out quickly.

593
01:11:47,443 --> 01:11:48,432
Come on...keep it.

594
01:11:49,579 --> 01:11:57,679
What' re you saying? After all,
your daughter is our daughter.

595
01:11:58,354 --> 01:12:01,812
You've taken care
of Aarti so well.

596
01:12:02,592 --> 01:12:03,889
Many, many thanks to you!

597
01:12:24,547 --> 01:12:27,948
Always remain just
as you are.

598
01:12:32,689 --> 01:12:35,453
l' m leaving, Auntie.

599
01:12:35,958 --> 01:12:40,986
No. Never say you' re leaving.
Say that you' ll return.

600
01:12:48,271 --> 01:12:49,363
Shall we leave?

601
01:12:55,878 --> 01:12:59,177
Hey! You' re wearing dark
sunglasses in the night?

602
01:13:00,349 --> 01:13:01,281
What's wrong?

603
01:13:02,385 --> 01:13:06,412
Something is hurting my eyes.

604
01:13:08,257 --> 01:13:11,420
lt must be a particle of dust.
lt' ll come out by itself.

605
01:13:13,529 --> 01:13:14,996
Let's leave, Driver.

606
01:13:18,101 --> 01:13:19,068
Come on...

607
01:13:21,471 --> 01:13:24,099
Come on...we've to reach
the airport, after all.

608
01:13:24,373 --> 01:13:25,635
Come on...be seated.

609
01:13:34,717 --> 01:13:37,242
Poor Raja!

610
01:13:49,232 --> 01:13:50,426
What did you do all these days?

611
01:13:51,667 --> 01:13:52,964
Nothing special.

612
01:13:55,338 --> 01:13:58,637
My daughter is not in a mood
to talk to me.

613
01:13:59,575 --> 01:14:01,543
Anyhow, l' ll speak
to somebody else.

614
01:14:02,678 --> 01:14:04,646
What's your name, driver?

615
01:14:08,117 --> 01:14:11,780
Wow! That's a nice name.

616
01:14:12,822 --> 01:14:15,347
Once you hear such a name, it
can't be forgotten for a lifetime.

617
01:14:17,059 --> 01:14:18,549
How much do you manage to earn?

618
01:14:18,995 --> 01:14:20,394
lt depends on the person.

619
01:14:21,197 --> 01:14:23,859
Some give me a lot.
Some give nothing.

620
01:14:26,002 --> 01:14:27,299
You speak well.

621
01:14:28,671 --> 01:14:30,138
You drive quite well too.

622
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:34,300
By the way, there's a scarcity
of drivers in Mumbai.

623
01:14:35,077 --> 01:14:36,567
Why don't you work with us?

624
01:14:37,079 --> 01:14:39,980
We' ll pay you a good salary.
And give you a room to live in.

625
01:14:40,349 --> 01:14:42,010
What say, Aarti?

626
01:14:42,819 --> 01:14:45,014
No, Sir. l' m fine here.

627
01:14:46,289 --> 01:14:50,282
Why? What's the matter?
Are you married?

628
01:14:51,694 --> 01:14:55,323
- No, Sir.
- Why not?

629
01:14:56,432 --> 01:15:00,266
l haven't yet got
what l desired.

630
01:15:02,538 --> 01:15:09,102
How strange! You people
live in a dream world.

631
01:15:09,846 --> 01:15:12,314
As if some dream girl is
going to come.

632
01:15:12,782 --> 01:15:16,843
Why not, Sir? She' ll come someday.

633
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:18,744
A dream girl will
surely come for me.

634
01:15:21,123 --> 01:15:21,782
Hey!

635
01:15:22,525 --> 01:15:24,220
What's this traffic jam for?

636
01:15:30,933 --> 01:15:42,276
Hey! Raja! My dear! Tell me...
where are you going?

637
01:15:42,979 --> 01:15:44,310
Where are you going?

638
01:15:45,514 --> 01:15:48,244
O Madam! How' re you, Madam?

639
01:15:48,618 --> 01:15:52,145
- Who's he?
- He's Balwant Singh.

640
01:15:53,089 --> 01:15:55,080
He's my father.

641
01:15:55,958 --> 01:15:57,448
Greetings! How' re you?

642
01:15:58,628 --> 01:15:59,492
Why this traffic jam?

643
01:15:59,996 --> 01:16:02,988
The traffic jam has been
caused because of a landslide.

644
01:16:04,934 --> 01:16:07,767
But we've to reach the
airport by morning!

645
01:16:08,671 --> 01:16:10,332
No problem. lt won't take
longer than a couple of hours.

646
01:16:10,773 --> 01:16:14,766
But why don't you have some food
at the eating joint close-by?

647
01:22:36,925 --> 01:22:38,119
How wonderful!

648
01:22:39,128 --> 01:22:41,995
There's so much feeling
in your voice!

649
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:50,136
lt's said that when a heart breaks,
it makes no sound.

650
01:22:50,572 --> 01:22:55,305
But when it breaks,
it causes havoc.

651
01:22:56,745 --> 01:23:05,915
There's anguish in your voice.
There's that love in your voice.

652
01:23:07,056 --> 01:23:07,988
But listen...

653
01:23:08,957 --> 01:23:11,016
The people in the world
around you...

654
01:23:11,327 --> 01:23:15,923
...won't do justice to
your pain and your love.

655
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:19,793
You' ll be left trembling.
You' ll keep singing.

656
01:23:20,135 --> 01:23:22,228
And this world will
just stand and stare.

657
01:23:22,838 --> 01:23:25,204
Listen...you continue to sing.

658
01:23:25,674 --> 01:23:31,306
And today...after a long time...
l' ll dance wholeheartedly.

659
01:25:55,290 --> 01:25:57,121
Hold on!

660
01:25:57,693 --> 01:26:01,561
Our Aarti will never marry
your Raja taxi-driver.

661
01:26:02,197 --> 01:26:03,994
Don't you speak
bad things.

662
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:05,962
lf l weren't fond of you...

663
01:26:06,401 --> 01:26:09,529
...l would've ensured that
you were dealt with properly.

664
01:26:11,607 --> 01:26:15,509
You'd better hold back
your breath.

665
01:26:16,044 --> 01:26:16,874
You will need it to
extinguish the lamps.

666
01:26:17,179 --> 01:26:18,009
This marriage will never
take place.

667
01:26:18,447 --> 01:26:20,210
- lt' ll take place.
- lt won't take place.

668
01:26:20,582 --> 01:26:21,776
- Why not?
- lt won't take place.

669
01:26:22,217 --> 01:26:24,617
- Let's bet on it.
- All right.

670
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:25,750
Let's put our arms on trial.

671
01:26:26,154 --> 01:26:26,950
Come on...

672
01:26:29,324 --> 01:26:34,591
l' m asking you once again.

673
01:26:35,364 --> 01:26:38,959
Lovers hold hands firmly.
They don't leave it.

674
01:26:39,668 --> 01:26:41,693
Let's get down to
the confrontation.

675
01:26:42,137 --> 01:26:44,765
- ls it? Here it is.
- Come on...

676
01:26:52,814 --> 01:26:53,576
lt's so warm.

677
01:26:54,349 --> 01:26:55,247
lt's so warm!

678
01:27:01,990 --> 01:27:05,517
- You lost!
- Shut up, will you?

679
01:27:05,994 --> 01:27:07,655
You indulge in cheating?

680
01:27:08,196 --> 01:27:11,859
You show me your Doordarshan
and ruin my Star TV.

681
01:27:12,267 --> 01:27:13,825
Why did you unbutton your dress?

682
01:27:14,269 --> 01:27:16,237
l was feeling hot.
So l unbuttoned it.

683
01:27:16,538 --> 01:27:19,666
7 What if l did unbutton my shirt?
Wouldn't l have felt hot then?

684
01:27:20,108 --> 01:27:26,240
Don't scream. lf that's the
case, let's compete once again.

685
01:27:26,815 --> 01:27:27,907
l' ll win again.

686
01:27:28,984 --> 01:27:30,747
- You' re too confident.
- Yes.

687
01:27:31,286 --> 01:27:32,685
All right. This contest
will be a different one.

688
01:27:33,055 --> 01:27:34,044
What's that?

689
01:27:35,924 --> 01:27:37,949
- Are you willing to wrestle?
- Wrestle?

690
01:27:38,827 --> 01:27:40,852
You got scared, didn't you?

691
01:27:42,898 --> 01:27:44,798
l' m not scared. l' m not
scared of anybody.

692
01:27:45,634 --> 01:27:47,499
- Then how about a bout?
- All right.

693
01:27:47,603 --> 01:27:49,298
Let's go then.

694
01:27:50,005 --> 01:27:50,733
Come on!

695
01:27:59,982 --> 01:28:00,949
Come on, Balwant!

696
01:28:20,636 --> 01:28:22,331
Leave me.

697
01:28:22,671 --> 01:28:24,696
- You have lost, haven't you?
- Yes.

698
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:26,166
Will you become a girl now?

699
01:28:27,142 --> 01:28:28,507
- All right.
- Will you marry me?

700
01:28:29,645 --> 01:28:31,636
l will. Leave me now.

701
01:28:33,749 --> 01:28:43,090
You' ll get married.
You' ll surely get married.

702
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:52,860
Aarti has made her decision.

703
01:28:54,069 --> 01:28:57,630
And perhaps you' re waiting
for my decision.

704
01:28:59,841 --> 01:29:04,244
For the sake of my daughter's
happiness, l've agreed to her.

705
01:29:06,581 --> 01:29:10,608
But before this marriage,
l've some conditions.

706
01:29:12,054 --> 01:29:16,252
Aarti will not live here.

707
01:29:17,559 --> 01:29:21,427
And you' ll have to live
with us in Mumbai.

708
01:29:23,265 --> 01:29:27,326
You' ll mould yourself
in our ways.

709
01:29:28,203 --> 01:29:30,637
You' ll learn the etiquette
of our society...

710
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:35,701
...and you' ll do only that
which you' re asked to.

711
01:29:36,311 --> 01:29:38,142
- Not at all.
- What?

712
01:29:38,914 --> 01:29:40,347
Neither will l come to Mumbai...

713
01:29:40,816 --> 01:29:43,307
...nor will l learn the
etiquette of your society.

714
01:29:44,186 --> 01:29:46,848
And nor will l become
what you want to make me.

715
01:29:47,889 --> 01:29:50,585
l am just like l am now.
And l' ll remain like this.

716
01:29:51,226 --> 01:29:57,028
Did you hear? What l want to make
him, and what he wants to remain?

717
01:29:58,233 --> 01:30:01,862
Yes...are you listening?

718
01:30:03,572 --> 01:30:09,408
And listen carefully...because
l' ll remain just like l am.

719
01:30:10,412 --> 01:30:12,277
l won't change for anybody.

720
01:30:13,415 --> 01:30:15,815
lf you want to accept me
despite all this...

721
01:30:16,551 --> 01:30:23,320
...this is the time
for you to decide.

722
01:30:31,032 --> 01:30:34,866
You' re leaving, Aarti?

723
01:30:36,304 --> 01:30:39,296
You' re leaving your father?

724
01:30:41,910 --> 01:30:48,110
You'd learned to take your first
step with my assistance.

725
01:30:48,884 --> 01:30:53,548
And today, you' re taking away
those very steps away from me?

726
01:30:55,323 --> 01:30:58,884
Don't go...come back.

727
01:31:20,982 --> 01:31:23,450
This is my place from today.

728
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:27,486
Bless us.

729
01:31:28,323 --> 01:31:30,382
Bless you?

730
01:31:30,826 --> 01:31:32,623
l cannot bless this
mistake of yours.

731
01:31:33,061 --> 01:31:34,892
Your marriage will never succeed.

732
01:31:36,398 --> 01:31:41,563
You' ll never remain happy
by staying away from me.

733
01:31:42,604 --> 01:31:45,129
Gulab and Kamal...let's leave.

734
01:31:45,707 --> 01:31:46,537
Yes?

735
01:31:46,875 --> 01:31:51,209
l too will stay here. My marriage
has been finalized with Balwant.

736
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:53,540
Marriage with Balwant?

737
01:31:54,416 --> 01:31:57,385
And you, have you fallen in
love with somebody too?

738
01:31:58,053 --> 01:32:00,283
Yes, l've fallen in love too.

739
01:32:01,056 --> 01:32:02,990
l've fallen in love
with all these lovers.

740
01:32:03,692 --> 01:32:06,718
Henceforth, l' ll live in this river
of love. l won't go away from here.

741
01:32:07,195 --> 01:32:09,186
All of you have turned
crazy about love.

742
01:32:09,698 --> 01:32:11,563
You' ll die because of
the illusion of love.

743
01:32:12,901 --> 01:32:14,300
Come on...

744
01:32:21,743 --> 01:32:22,937
No, my daughter...

745
01:32:23,812 --> 01:32:26,781
Father didn't even bless me!

746
01:32:27,749 --> 01:32:28,681
So what?

747
01:32:29,651 --> 01:32:31,619
We' ll bless you.

748
01:32:32,654 --> 01:32:34,952
Perhaps God kept us childless...

749
01:32:35,323 --> 01:32:38,349
...so that we may get you married.

750
01:32:39,294 --> 01:32:41,057
Yes, my child...

751
01:34:19,129 --> 01:34:27,332
l'd never imagined that my only
daughter would revolt against me.

752
01:34:27,905 --> 01:34:29,702
That she would insult me like this.

753
01:34:30,174 --> 01:34:33,507
That too for a tourist guide,
a taxi driver?

754
01:34:34,078 --> 01:34:35,773
No. This marriage can
never take place.

755
01:34:36,780 --> 01:34:39,271
lf she's stubborn,
l' m also no less.

756
01:34:39,917 --> 01:34:41,475
l' ll disinherit her
from my property.

757
01:34:42,019 --> 01:34:44,283
l won't bequeath her anything.
