00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:10,009
NARRATOR: And it came to pass
that there went out

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,011
a decree from Caesar Augustus

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,514
that all the world
should be taxed,

4
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:19,519
and all went to be taxed,
everyone, to his own city,

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,523
for to disobey the Roman emperor
meant certain death.

6
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,027
Oh, there were young people
and old people.

7
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,029
There were the famous
and mighty,

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,032
and some not yet known,

9
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,034
but whose names would
eventually linger

10
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:40,039
and be revered for all time.

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,541
There were good people
who could ill afford

12
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,544
the cruel tax about
to be imposed upon them,

13
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,048
and there were others.

14
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,548
And there were others.

15
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,572
Observe, Ali, the little
drummer boy Aaron.

16
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:18,077
Are those animals
dancing, Ben haramed?

17
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,080
BEN: They certainly are.

18
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,083
Faster, old friends. Faster.

00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,587

Baa!

24
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:38,097

I will be as rich as Solomon.

29
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:53,113
But it is said
Aaron dislikes all humans.

30
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,614
He will not join us willingly.

we brought the rope?

32
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,120
Ah!

Grab the lamb!

How? I have only two hands!

43
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,153
Stop concerning yourself
with details!

Do it!

NARRATOR: The little
drummer boy Aaron

63
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,753
fought Ben haramed and Ali
with all his might.

64
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,756
He most definitely did not want
to join the showman's caravan,

65
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,759
a journey into the crowded city,

66
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,762
FOR IT WAS TRUE:
Aaron hated people...

67
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,764
All people.

68
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,767
No! No! I won't go with you!

69
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,270
Stop struggling, boy!

70
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,772
There is money to be made.

71
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,275
We can be rich!

72
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:40,279
While those taxpayers are
waiting to be counted,

73
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,781
they will grow bored.

74
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,784
They will crave the
entertainment which only I...

75
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,787
Ben haramed, king of
the desert showmen...

76
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:52,291
and of course you,
too, can provide.

77
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,294
But I do not want to
go near that mob.

78
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,797
I hate people! All people!

What a beautiful world
it would be without people.

But, alas, one must
exist with people.

82
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:14,313
And indeed, it is better
to be crowded and rich...

83
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,817
Than crowded... And poor.

84
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,318

NARRATOR: Oh, Ben haramed
was a wily old desert jackal.

109
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:47,406
Only he could have talked Aaron
into visiting the crowded city.

110
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:52,412
For you see, Aaron truly
did hate all people.

111
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,415
Now, it wasn't always this way,

112
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,917
for Aaron was once
a happy farm lad,

113
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,421
the son of a Shepherd.

114
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,922
Father! Mother!

115
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,923
Father! Mother!

116
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:09,429
And why this exceptional
greeting today, my son?

117
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,430
Oh, no reason.

118
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,432
Happy Birthday, Aaron.

119
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,934
Oh, father! Mother!

120
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,436
Did you bring me something?

121
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,438
I don't suppose...

122
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,441
This would interest you,
young man?

123
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,942
A drum!

124
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,945
My very own drum! Oh, father!

125
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,947
Try it out, Aaron!

126
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,451
NARRATOR: And perhaps because
it was a gift of love,

127
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:36,955
the drum had an almost
magical quality.

128
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:42,461
And the animals, when they heard
it, began to dance to its sound.

129
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,022
And the animals, when they heard
it, began to dance to its sound.

130
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:52,971
But Aaron's happiness
was to end all too soon,

131
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,975
for one night,
bandits of the desert attacked.

132
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,777
For one night,
bandits of the desert attacked.

133
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,483
What's going on out there?

134
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,984
Father!

135
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,487
You must run, my son. Escape!

136
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:08,988
But... run!

137
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,489
But... run!

138
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,492
NARRATOR: They burned the farm
and took the sheep,

139
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,997
and Aaron's happy life
had changed forever.

140
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:22,501
And so, Aaron roamed the land
a lonely orphan,

141
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:26,506
his only friends 3 of the farm
animals who had escaped.

142
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,508
He vowed to hate all humans

143
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,510
for what they had done
to his family,

144
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,012
and he kept that vow.

145
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,013
And he kept that vow.

146
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,317
BEN: Ah, Jerusalem at last.

147
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,820
Here we shall make our fortune.

00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,325

Wonderful, wonderful!

Perhaps you will show
your appreciation

for such a performance.

You must appease them.

00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:16,414
Are you ready?

182
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:17,916
I'm ready.

183
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:21,419
No, no. Smile. Smile!

184
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,423
See, only a smile
pleases the crowd.

185
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,425
Smile. Smile!

186
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,427
I cannot.

187
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:31,429
Not at... Them.

188
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,934
You stubborn little fool!
Then wear a painted one.

189
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:38,436
There. That's better.

190
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:39,938
When do I go on?

191
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:43,942
Now, before the dope juggles me
out of my life savings!

192
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,104

Don't let them get away
before I pass the hat!

215
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:59,517
NARRATOR: But as Aaron looked at
the faces of the cheering mob,

216
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:03,021
a great rage rose up inside him.

217
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,523
How dare they laugh and be happy

218
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:09,527
after what their kind
did to his family!

219
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:11,529
Stop! Quiet!

220
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,532
I hate you all for what you did!

221
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,535
You're all preying
thieves and bandits

222
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,536
and knaves and...

223
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:19,537
and knaves and...

224
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,344
run for it!

225
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,846
NARRATOR: And so,
the troupe was chased

226
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,347
out of Jerusalem by the mob.

227
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:32,852
BEN: Boy, you shall pay
for this indignity.

228
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:34,854
Ben haramed! Look!

229
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:36,354
Ben haramed! Look!

230
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:40,358
BEN: By the hounds of heaven,
it is the caravan...

231
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,862
Of a king! We're in luck!

232
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:47,866
Can I believe my luck?
Two kings!

233
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,368
Hold me up! Three!

234
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,370
Three kings!

235
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,371
Three kings!

236
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:57,877
NARRATOR: And behold, there came
wise men from the east,

237
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:00,379
three kings of the orient,

238
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,382
and lo, the star which they saw

239
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,384
went before them.

240
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:07,385
Went before them.

241
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,403
Yes, it was the star
of Bethlehem

242
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:27,906
which shone so brightly

243
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:32,410
and graced the lonely darkening
desert with its silver light.

244
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:35,914
But the little troupe did not
see the star's beauty,

245
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:39,919
for the souls of Ben haramed and
Ali were too filled with greed

246
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:43,922
and the heart of Aaron
too overflowing with hatred

247
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:47,926
to take any note of
the wonder just above them.

248
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,428
Now you listen, drummer boy.

249
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,430
If you give this
one performance,

250
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,432
half the money shall be yours.

251
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:57,435
Then you are free.

252
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:00,438
NARRATOR: Aaron agreed,
only because he knew

253
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:01,940
that with the kings' money,

254
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,943
he would be free
to go his own way

255
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:07,946
and never again have to
trouble himself with humans.

256
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,949
AND SO THEY APPROACHED
THE THREE KINGS:

257
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,954
Melchior, caspar, and balthazar.

258
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,957
'Tis night. We must break camp.

259
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:23,461
And swiftly!
The star waits not for us.

260
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:26,965
Strike the tents!
Pack the camels!

261
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,287
Strike the tents!
Pack the camels!

262
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,974
No! Don't go!

263
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,976
We just got here!

264
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,477
Halt! Out of my way!

265
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:40,979
We must perform!

266
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,981
Down, knave! Down!

267
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:47,485
Ben haramed... A knave?

268
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:48,486
Ben haramed... A knave?

269
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:52,490
I am crushed.

270
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:53,992
Lower your Spears.

271
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:57,996
These desert vagabonds
seem to mean us no harm.

272
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,498
Why do you come to us?

273
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,501
We are a troupe of players,
your majesty...

274
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,503
uh, majesties.

275
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:09,507
We have no time for
making merry, as you see.

276
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:11,009
We break camp, and...

277
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,011
well, that's ridiculous.

278
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,513
Begging your pardon.

279
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,015
Nobody travels
the desert by night!

280
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,516
We do...

281
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,519
For we follow the star.

282
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,020
For we follow the star.

283
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:25,523
BEN: How very... Convenient.

284
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,025
But, uh...

285
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,027
Enough.

286
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,528
Begone.

287
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,530
Now, to resume our journey.

288
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:33,612
Now, to resume our journey.

289
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,535
So close.

290
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:40,538
My fortune was so close!

291
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:43,541
And see what they load
on the camels,

292
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:44,542
great one.

293
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,545
Gold!

294
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,547
Oh, it's too painful.

295
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,549
[MOANING]

296
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,052
AND MORE VALUABLE
EVEN THAN GOLD:

297
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,554
The precious eastern resins

298
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:59,058
frankincense and myrrh.

299
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:00,558
Frankincense and myrrh.

300
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,062
She is too weak to
go on, your majesties.

301
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,064
Poor creature.

302
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:08,066
She has been weakened
by the long journey.

303
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,568
Have we no extra beasts?

304
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:12,070
All are laden,

305
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,073
almost beyond their strength.

306
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:15,573
MELCHIOR: Wait!

307
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:18,077
Did that player not own a camel?

308
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:21,079
Perhaps he would sell it.

309
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,080
No!

310
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,081
No!

311
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:27,585
You strike a hard
bargain, player.

312
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:30,088
I've had a hard life.

313
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,589
CASPAR: Now load the beast,

314
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,591
and let us be on our way.

315
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:34,592

317
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,604

the weight of it,

319
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,608
the look of it.

320
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:51,610
Ahh.

321
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,111
Ahh.

322

Your share.

323
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,116
I don't want it!

324
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,618
I don't want any part of you!

325

NARRATOR: Aaron climbed
the tallest hill he could find,

333
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,144
but the royal caravan
was nowhere in sight.

334
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:26,145
But the royal caravan
was nowhere in sight.

335
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:28,646
Baa!

336
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,648

The star?

340
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,654
Yes.

341
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:39,158
The kings were
following that star.

342
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,659
If we follow it,

343
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,661
we are sure to
catch up with them.

00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:09,848
By that old stable up ahead.

362
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,349
See?

363
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,351
[CHOIR CONTINUES SINGING]

364
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,352
[CHOIR CONTINUES SINGING]

365
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,382
The royal caravan!

366
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:45,884
We found it!

367
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,886
See, there is old Joshua!

368
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,887
Joshua!

369
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:52,390
NARRATOR: Their hearts
were so full of joy

370
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,392
that they did not look
where they were going.

371
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,395
Suddenly, something came
careening out of the darkness.

372
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,897
DRIVER: Out of my way,
ragamuffin!

373
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:00,898
Baba!

374
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:01,899
Baba!

375
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:09,407
Oh, baba, you mustn't
die! You mustn't!

376
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,409
Who could help me?

377
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,410
Who could help me?

378
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,914
Yes. The kings.

379
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,416
The kings are wise.

380
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,918
They will be able to save baba.

381
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,159
They will be able to save baba.

382
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:25,423
Please, I've got to get
inside to see the kings!

383
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,425
You must let me through!

384
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,928
NARRATOR: And when Aaron came
to the entrance of the stable,

385
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,431
he could hardly believe
what he saw.

386
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:34,832
He could hardly believe
what he saw.

387
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:38,936
And she brought forth
her firstborn son

388
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:41,439
and wrapped him
in swaddling clothes

389
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,441
and laid him in a manger

390
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:47,945
because there was no room
for them in the inn.

391
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:49,447
Oh, your majesty!

392
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,449
You must... shh.

393
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,450
You must... shh.

394
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,952
Oh. The player boy.

395
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,455
My lamb has been injured.

396
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:58,956
You must save him.

397
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,958
He is near death.

398
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:03,461
Oh, lad, there is
nothing I can do.

399
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:06,464
But... But you're a king!

400
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,966
A mortal king only.

401
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:12,970
But... There is
a king among kings

402
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:15,473
who would save
your little friend.

403
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,475
The babe?

404
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:20,478
But I do not understand.

405
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:25,983
CASPAR: It is not necessary
that you understand. Go to him.

406
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,985
But... I...

407
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:30,488
I have no gift to bring.

408
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:34,992
Go. Look upon the newborn king.

NARRATOR: And as Aaron
looked at the babe,

436
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,122
he thought it was
the most beautiful sight

437
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,123
he had ever seen.

438
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:50,127
AARON: And yet, there is
something more about him...

439
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:51,629
So much more.

440
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,631
Your gift, little drummer boy,

441
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:57,134
given out of the
simple desperation

442
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:58,636
of a pure love,

443
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:02,139
is the one favored above all.

444
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,141
See?

445
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:08,647
NARRATOR: Aaron's heart
was filled with joy and love,

446
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:10,648
and he knew at last

447
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,151
that the hate he had
carried there was wrong,

448
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:17,655
as all hatred
will ever be wrong.

449
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:21,158
For more powerful,
more beautiful by far

450
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:25,663
than all the eons of sadness
and cruelty and desolation

451
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,665
which have come before

452
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:34,672
was that one tiny, crystalline
second of laughter.

453
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:37,675
Blessed are the pure in heart,

454
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:41,178
for they shall see God.

455
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:42,179
For they shall see God.
