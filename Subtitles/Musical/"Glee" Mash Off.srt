1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,600
<i>So here's what you missed on Glee.</i>

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,613
<i>Quinn and Puck want their baby back,
but then Puck kissed Shelby,</i>

3
00:00:03,621 --> 00:00:04,630
<i>so now he doesn't know
what side he's on.</i>

4
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:05,722
Do you want
our baby back or not?

5
00:00:05,747 --> 00:00:06,935
<i>Santana and Brittany have</i>

6
00:00:06,969 --> 00:00:08,416
<i>a secret thing going,
and they quit</i>

7
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:09,620
<i>the Glee Club with Mercedes
to join the Trouble Tones.</i>

8
00:00:09,659 --> 00:00:11,081
Awesome! More backup for me.

9
00:00:12,505 --> 00:00:13,835
<i>because they're both
running for Congress.</i>

10
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:15,880
I'm too late to get
on the ballot, but I can still

11
00:00:15,921 --> 00:00:17,672
<i>run as a write-in candidate.
And Kurt and Rachel and Brittany</i>

12
00:00:17,711 --> 00:00:19,000
<i>are all mad
at each other because</i>

13
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:20,053
<i>they're all running
for class president.</i>

14
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:20,997
I will see you at the debate.

15
00:00:21,055 --> 00:00:22,354
<i>Everyone's mad at each other.</i>

16
00:00:22,393 --> 00:00:23,143
<i>It's crazy.
No, you're crazy!</i>

17
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,337
Did you airbrush out your jowls?

18
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:25,479
I can't work with her!

19
00:00:25,507 --> 00:00:26,678
I thought I smelled blue collar.

20
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:27,984
Stop!
Would you turn that thing off?

21
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:29,374
<i>And that's what
you missed on Glee.</i>

22
00:00:31,767 --> 00:00:32,902
(school bell ringing)

23
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,177
<i>PUCK:
It's happened.</i>

24
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:36,469
<i>The Lion King, Puckfasa,
has been caged.</i>

25
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,959
<i>I've been in love before,
but this time feels different.</i>

26
00:00:38,993 --> 00:00:40,976
<i>This time feels grown up.</i>

27
00:00:40,996 --> 00:00:41,969
<i>Don't judge me.</i>

28
00:00:42,016 --> 00:00:43,428
<i>I'm 18; it's legal.</i>

29
00:00:43,463 --> 00:00:45,460
<i>Besides, the age difference
isn't that crazy.</i>

30
00:00:45,494 --> 00:00:47,453
<i>Just look at Ashton and Demi,
Indiana Jones and Ally McBeal,</i>

31
00:00:47,487 --> 00:00:49,457
<i>Woody Allen
and that Chinese girl.</i>

32
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:51,028
<i>I get that teacher/student
relationships are tricky,</i>

33
00:00:51,097 --> 00:00:52,938
<i>but aren't all relationships?</i>

34
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:55,917
<i>I'm willing to put in
the work for this one.</i>

35
00:00:59,514 --> 00:01:02,474
<i>When she looks at me, I don't
feel like a boy anymore.</i>

36
00:01:02,508 --> 00:01:05,011
<i>I feel like the man
that I've always wanted to be.</i>

37
00:01:05,045 --> 00:01:06,545
<i>A family man.</i>

38
00:01:06,595 --> 00:01:08,494
<i>I live for fourth period.</i>

39
00:01:08,517 --> 00:01:10,144
<i>Shelby's been subbing for
Mr. Clippenger in Geometry</i>

40
00:01:10,178 --> 00:01:11,515
<i>ever since he ate
that bad cantaloupe.</i>

41
00:01:11,543 --> 00:01:13,107
<i>I know I'm supposed to be
learning about</i>

42
00:01:13,168 --> 00:01:14,986
<i>grammars and stuff,
but all I can think about</i>

43
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,103
<i>is what color underwear
Ms. C is wearing</i>

44
00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:18,723
<i>and if she knows how to dance.</i>

45
00:01:18,774 --> 00:01:21,692
(Van Halen's "Hot For Teacher"

(screaming)

47
00:01:25,814 --> 00:01:27,456
Did you do your homework, dude?

48
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:29,492
(students chattering)

49
00:01:29,526 --> 00:01:32,375
PUCK:.

50
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,578
Wait. W-Wait
a second, man.

51
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,002
What do you think the teacher's
gonna look like this year?

52
00:01:39,036 --> 00:01:41,550
Whoa!

53
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:47,049
¶ T-Teacher,
stop that screaming ¶

54
00:01:47,088 --> 00:01:49,173
¶ Teacher, don't you see?

55
00:01:49,207 --> 00:01:52,677
¶ Don't want to be
no uptown fool ¶

56
00:01:52,711 --> 00:01:55,675
¶ Maybe I should go to hell,
but I am doing well ¶

57
00:01:55,709 --> 00:02:00,268
¶ Teacher needs to see me
after school ¶

58
00:02:00,318 --> 00:02:04,388
¶ I think of all the education
that I missed ¶

59
00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:07,405
¶ But then my homework
was never quite like this ¶

60
00:02:10,724 --> 00:02:14,505
¶ Oh, got it bad,
got it bad, got it bad ¶

61
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:16,917
¶ I'm hot for teacher

62
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:22,211
¶ I got it bad, so bad

63
00:02:22,245 --> 00:02:24,764
¶ I'm hot for teacher

64
00:02:28,765 --> 00:02:31,766
Ah, I think the clock
is slow, man.

65
00:02:31,802 --> 00:02:32,772
I don't feel tardy.

66
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:34,020
Ah, I just been here so long.

67
00:02:34,057 --> 00:02:36,226
I got to get out of here.

68
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,854
Class dismissed!

69
00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:46,733
¶ I heard about your lessons,
but lessons are so cold ¶

70
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:49,654
¶ I know about this school

71
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:53,872
¶ Little girl from Cherry Lawn,
how can you be so bold? ¶

72
00:02:53,902 --> 00:02:57,621
¶ How did you know
that golden rule? ¶

73
00:02:57,657 --> 00:03:00,714
¶ I think of all the education
that I missed ¶

74
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:04,886
¶ But then my homework
was never quite like this ¶

75
00:03:07,758 --> 00:03:11,312
¶ Whoa, got it bad,
got it bad, got it bad ¶

76
00:03:11,346 --> 00:03:13,645
¶ I'm hot for teacher

77
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:18,678
¶ I've got it bad, so bad

78
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:21,903
¶ I'm hot for teacher

79
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:25,569
¶ Whoa, oh, yes, I'm hot

80
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:28,305
¶ Oh, whoa, oh, yes, I'm hot

81
00:03:28,327 --> 00:03:30,356
¶ Whoa.

82
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:34,415
(music ends)

83
00:03:34,443 --> 00:03:36,246
Whoo!
(laughs)

84
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:37,326
Wow!

85
00:03:37,364 --> 00:03:39,506
Puck, guys, spectacular!

86
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,006
What a way
to start off this week!

87
00:03:41,038 --> 00:03:41,918
You guys didn'td

88
00:03:41,963 --> 00:03:43,290
an assignment to work on this.

89
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:44,710
You just did it.

90
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,852
Mr. Schuester, while
the performance was excellent...

91
00:03:46,882 --> 00:03:48,257
particularly the drumming...

92
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:49,379
don't you think
that the subject matter

93
00:03:49,435 --> 00:03:50,501
is a little inappropriate?

94
00:03:50,503 --> 00:03:51,637
Well, that depends on

95
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:53,599
what Puck's intent was
when he chose this song.

96
00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:01,314
I guess I just,
uh, dig Van Halen.

97
00:04:01,348 --> 00:04:02,553
All right!

98
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,949
Rock on!

99
00:04:03,973 --> 00:04:04,949
(applause)

100
00:04:04,983 --> 00:04:06,461
Yep, good job, guys.

==SPREAD THE WORD==

103
00:04:09,648 --> 00:04:11,986
<i>SUE: Burt Hummel...
he's running for Congress.</i>

104
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,653
<i>Last year,
he had a heart attack.</i>

105
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:15,073
<i>He might have had
a heart transplant.</i>

106
00:04:15,123 --> 00:04:16,953
<i>And he might have got it
from a baboon.</i>

107
00:04:16,998 --> 00:04:18,702
(baboons grunting wildly)

108
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:20,580
<i>Baboons are dangerous killers</i>

109
00:04:20,646 --> 00:04:22,575
who throtheir own feces
when they're not tearing off

110
00:04:22,626 --> 00:04:26,126
people's faces or admiring
their own weird butts.

111
00:04:26,161 --> 00:04:27,545
<i>Congress is bad enough.</i>

112
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,541
<i>If Burt Hummel thinks
what Washington needs is</i>

113
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:32,226
<i>more baboon parts, then
he needs a brain transplant.</i>

114
00:04:32,253 --> 00:04:34,006
Watch out, baboons.

115
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,508
Burt Hummel
and his baboon heart.

116
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,582
Wrong on the issues,
wrong for Ohio.

117
00:04:37,835 --> 00:04:39,104
I'm Sue Sylvester.

118
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:41,679
I have a human heart,
and I approve this mes...

119
00:04:41,713 --> 00:04:43,686
The man had angioplasty!

120
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,021
She's telling lies!

121
00:04:45,055 --> 00:04:46,652
She's playing dirty
and she's getting away with it!

122
00:04:46,696 --> 00:04:48,109
Okay. Will, breathe deep,
breathe deep, breathe deep.

123
00:04:48,152 --> 00:04:50,030
We have to play nice.

124
00:04:50,064 --> 00:04:53,287
Because if you win by fighting
dirty, it's not really winning.

125
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:54,955
That's what we
teach our students.

126
00:04:54,957 --> 00:04:55,928
Right?

127
00:04:55,944 --> 00:04:57,366
(groans)

128
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,568
(school bell ringing)

129
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,836
What you're doing is appalling.

130
00:04:59,873 --> 00:05:01,841
Do you know
20% of all voters think

131
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,240
my dad actually has
a baboon heart.

132
00:05:03,254 --> 00:05:05,502
It's not personal,
Porcelain, it's politics.

133
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,549
And politics are

134
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,008
all about playing dirty.

135
00:05:08,036 --> 00:05:10,002
You should know.

136
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:12,358
Your squeaky-clean campaign
for class president

137
00:05:12,374 --> 00:05:14,877
is getting a good ol' fashioned
country shellackin'.

138
00:05:14,911 --> 00:05:16,095
BRITTANY:
Yo, fellow Americans.

139
00:05:16,138 --> 00:05:17,134
Okay, listen.

140
00:05:17,188 --> 00:05:18,680
A vote for Brittany
is a vote for

141
00:05:18,716 --> 00:05:20,350
root beer water fountains
and robot teachers.

142
00:05:20,385 --> 00:05:21,605
Did you say "robot teachers"?

143
00:05:21,641 --> 00:05:22,599
Yep.
Radical!

144
00:05:22,642 --> 00:05:23,608
I've always wanted one.

145
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,930
And also, listen.

146
00:05:24,947 --> 00:05:28,316
Rachel Berry is still on MySpace
and thus unfit to lead.

147
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:29,623
That's ridiculous.

148
00:05:29,643 --> 00:05:31,401
Brittany's making promises
shcan't deliver on.

149
00:05:31,435 --> 00:05:34,034
It's lying! And no one is even
on MySpace, not even Rachel!

150
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,045
It doesn't matter.

151
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,382
Brittany's got their attention.

152
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,419
And you're playing all nice,
campaigning for

153
00:05:38,453 --> 00:05:40,208
a salad bar in the cafeteria.

154
00:05:40,246 --> 00:05:42,664
It's boring, it's tired, it's
not going to get you elected.

155
00:05:42,712 --> 00:05:44,410
Well, obesity is a huge problem
at this school.

156
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:45,625
Especially in the Gleelub.

157
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:47,171
Have a seat, Yasser.

158
00:05:47,173 --> 00:05:48,550
You know why I fight dirty?

159
00:05:48,584 --> 00:05:50,002
Because I'm fighting

160
00:05:50,047 --> 00:05:51,145
for something.

161
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,792
I have a cause,
several actually.

162
00:05:53,822 --> 00:05:55,448
I hate the arts...

163
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,906
and a bunch of other stuff.

164
00:05:56,952 --> 00:06:00,622
If you want to win, find
yourself a cause, my friend.

165
00:06:00,644 --> 00:06:02,426
Then start flinging poo.

166
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,077
Winning is really about
poo flinging.

167
00:06:04,109 --> 00:06:05,571
I refuse to believe that.

168
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,393
I agree that perhaps
I need a better cause,

169
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,706
but I'm going to win this thing
without having to fling

170
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,103
a single stinky nugget.

171
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,828
Well, good luck with that, son
of Burt "Baboon Heart" Hummel.

172
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,876
It's not personal.

173
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:19,853
(school bell ringing)

174
00:06:19,887 --> 00:06:21,475
Hey, Shelby, what's up?

175
00:06:21,494 --> 00:06:22,615
We haven't talked since

176
00:06:22,755 --> 00:06:24,713
Mercedes and Santana
and Brittany

177
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,176
left New Directions.

178
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,460
I hope you know, I kept my word.

179
00:06:28,494 --> 00:06:29,637
I know.

180
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,633
You didn't recruit anyone.

181
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:31,938
It was, it was me.

182
00:06:31,981 --> 00:06:33,098
They left because of me.

183
00:06:33,148 --> 00:06:34,679
No, no, it's not your fault.

184
00:06:34,801 --> 00:06:36,514
They're talented.
They just want a chance

185
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:38,146
to take center stage
during their senior year.

186
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,135
(sighs)

187
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:40,403
Did you get your letter today?

188
00:06:40,506 --> 00:06:41,895
About Sectionals? Yeah.

189
00:06:41,897 --> 00:06:43,400
Figures we'd be up against you.

190
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:45,288
Don't forget
the Dulcet Dazzlers.

191
00:06:45,308 --> 00:06:46,267
(laughs)

192
00:06:46,303 --> 00:06:47,356
So lame.

193
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:52,800
You know, we may get
along, but the kids won't.

194
00:06:52,976 --> 00:06:55,414
I mean, it's going to
get ugly around here.

195
00:06:55,471 --> 00:06:57,921
It's the last year for a lot
of them and they want to win.

196
00:06:57,923 --> 00:06:59,684
Well, maybe competition will
bring out the best in them.

197
00:06:59,718 --> 00:07:01,252
Or maybe it'll turn
into World War Glee.

198
00:07:03,143 --> 00:07:04,725
We usually do mash-ups
around this time.

199
00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:06,046
It's always my favorite.

200
00:07:06,048 --> 00:07:08,059
Everyone's so happy.

201
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,602
So, you can still do it.

202
00:07:09,648 --> 00:07:11,501
You know, maybe there's a way

203
00:07:11,535 --> 00:07:13,634
to work with
all this fighting spirit.

204
00:07:13,681 --> 00:07:17,886
Get the kids to channel it
into something great.

205
00:07:17,935 --> 00:07:20,135
Talk to me.

206
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:22,063
(school bell ringing)

207
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:23,138
What are you doing here?

208
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:24,838
Shelby told us she had
something to show us.

209
00:07:24,872 --> 00:07:25,878
What are you doing here?

210
00:07:25,898 --> 00:07:27,557
Mr. Shue said the same thing.

211
00:07:27,601 --> 00:07:30,605
Let me guess, he wants to
combine choirs for Sectionals.

212
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,515
Well, it's not gonna happen.

213
00:07:31,549 --> 00:07:32,898
The Trouble Tones
are here to stay.

214
00:07:32,943 --> 00:07:34,236
So why don't you shuffle

215
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,829
your busted choir
off our stage.

216
00:07:35,858 --> 00:07:37,454
Look, you guys, we can compete
without being enemies.

217
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:38,911
All right?
We don't have to get vicious.

218
00:07:38,941 --> 00:07:40,702
Oh, I think we do, Soft Serve.

219
00:07:40,736 --> 00:07:44,448
See, the Trouble Tones are 3F:
fierce, femme, phenomenal.

220
00:07:44,504 --> 00:07:46,778
Oh, and, guys, hurry up,
go get some moist towels.

221
00:07:46,831 --> 00:07:49,083
We have to keep Finn wet before
we can roll him back in the sea.

222
00:07:49,116 --> 00:07:51,697
Okay, you know what, Santana,
Finn is in great shape,

223
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:53,072
and your meanness
only highlights

224
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,417
your own personal insecurities.

225
00:07:54,455 --> 00:07:56,075
And, Rachel,
your mustache is thicker

226
00:07:56,088 --> 00:07:57,424
than a Middle Eastern
dictator's.

227
00:07:57,463 --> 00:08:01,523
(playing mid-tempo intro)

228
00:08:01,544 --> 00:08:04,470
¶ It's been a long time since
I came around ¶

229
00:08:04,516 --> 00:08:08,097
¶ It's been a long time
but I'm backn town ¶

230
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:12,316
¶ This time, I'm not leaving
without you ¶

231
00:08:12,356 --> 00:08:15,137
Is this what having a stroke
feels like?

232
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,617
Because I like it.

233
00:08:16,652 --> 00:08:19,936
¶ Just you and I

234
00:08:19,953 --> 00:08:23,782
¶ Sharing our love together

235
00:08:23,815 --> 00:08:26,454
¶ And I know in time

236
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:30,442
¶ We'll build the dreams
we treasure ¶

237
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:33,873
¶ We'll be all right,
just you and I ¶

238
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:37,336
¶ Something, something
about this place ¶

239
00:08:37,387 --> 00:08:40,830
¶ Just you and, just you and I

240
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,973
¶ Something 'bout
lonely nights ¶

241
00:08:44,008 --> 00:08:46,173
¶ And my lipstick on your face

242
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:48,087
¶ Just you and I

243
00:08:48,121 --> 00:08:50,642
¶ Something, somethg about

244
00:08:50,684 --> 00:08:53,566
¶ My cool Nebraska guy

245
00:08:53,598 --> 00:08:54,511
¶ You and I

246
00:08:54,563 --> 00:08:56,484
¶ Yeah, something about

247
00:08:56,517 --> 00:08:58,491
¶ Baby, you and I

248
00:09:00,236 --> 00:09:03,437
¶ Oh, you and I

249
00:09:03,471 --> 00:09:07,077
¶ Remember our first embrace

250
00:09:07,107 --> 00:09:11,244
¶ The smile
that was on your face ¶

251
00:09:11,288 --> 00:09:14,448
¶ The promises that we made

252
00:09:14,482 --> 00:09:16,752
¶ Ooh

253
00:09:16,785 --> 00:09:21,177
¶ And now your love
is my reward ¶

254
00:09:21,206 --> 00:09:24,874
¶ And I love you even more

255
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:27,265
¶ Than I ever did before

256
00:09:27,298 --> 00:09:31,351
¶ Something, something
about this place ¶

257
00:09:31,386 --> 00:09:34,937
¶ Just you and, just you and I

258
00:09:34,969 --> 00:09:37,613
¶ Something 'bout
lonely nights ¶

259
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:39,941
¶ And my lipstick on your face

260
00:09:39,976 --> 00:09:42,119
¶ Just you and I

261
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,656
¶ Something, something about

262
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,489
¶ My cool Nebraska guy
¶ I love you, you and I

263
00:09:48,523 --> 00:09:49,866
¶ Put your drinks up

264
00:09:49,908 --> 00:09:51,909
¶ For Nebraska ¶ For Nebraska

265
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:53,409
¶ For Nebraska, Nebraska

266
00:09:53,454 --> 00:09:54,659
¶ I love you

267
00:09:54,693 --> 00:09:57,992
¶ You and I

268
00:09:58,026 --> 00:10:00,793
¶ You, you and I

269
00:10:00,837 --> 00:10:01,913
¶ Nebraska

270
00:10:01,965 --> 00:10:04,923
¶ I'd rather die

271
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:09,976
¶ Without you and I

272
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,709
¶ We made it

273
00:10:11,722 --> 00:10:16,982
¶ You and I.

274
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,811
(cheering, applause)

275
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:21,902
Mr. Shue, Shelby, I
think we can all admit

276
00:10:21,935 --> 00:10:24,193
that that was weirdly amazing.

277
00:10:24,227 --> 00:10:25,867
Buwhat exactly was the point?

278
00:10:25,901 --> 00:10:29,442
That sometimes bringing
together two conflicting things

279
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:31,119
can create something
totally unexpected.

280
00:10:31,176 --> 00:10:32,791
We're not combining
Glee Clubs, Mr. Shue.

281
00:10:32,842 --> 00:10:34,206
That's not what
I'm talking about.

282
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,865
Shelby and I agree
that with Sectionals

283
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:38,790
coming up for both of us,
it's time we all got serious

284
00:10:38,843 --> 00:10:40,582
with some friendly competition.

285
00:10:40,622 --> 00:10:41,700
SHELBY:
Each group's going to

286
00:10:41,734 --> 00:10:43,187
put together their own mash-up

287
00:10:43,215 --> 00:10:44,174
to perform head-to-head.

288
00:10:44,206 --> 00:10:45,222
WILL:
For the first annual

289
00:10:45,256 --> 00:10:47,123
McKinley High Mash-Off.
Mash-Off.

290
00:10:47,177 --> 00:10:48,679
Yeah!
Come on, now.

291
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:50,462
(cheering)

292
00:10:50,523 --> 00:10:52,433
Get you some!
Let's do this!

293
00:10:52,474 --> 00:10:53,889
That's pretty good, right?

294
00:10:53,923 --> 00:10:55,949
(school bell ringing)

295
00:10:58,393 --> 00:11:00,271
¶

296
00:11:05,147 --> 00:11:07,698
They were out of apples in
the cafeteria.

297
00:11:07,732 --> 00:11:10,006
Thank you.

298
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,865
I want you.

299
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:12,917
(scoffs) I'm your teacher.

300
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:13,917
You're my sub.

301
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:15,419
You can't deny the chemistry.

302
00:11:17,414 --> 00:11:19,338
I'm not some kid. I'm 18.

303
00:11:19,368 --> 00:11:21,509
I've already been
with a lot of older women.

304
00:11:21,538 --> 00:11:24,045
(sighs) Look, Noah, you
are very charming

305
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,299
and surprisingly set.

306
00:11:25,336 --> 00:11:27,370
The kiss was a mistake.

307
00:11:27,404 --> 00:11:29,344
Well, that mistake meant
something to me.

308
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,795
I felt something
I've never felt before.

309
00:11:31,866 --> 00:11:33,378
I'm in love with you.

310
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,296
Oh, God.

311
00:11:34,353 --> 00:11:35,712
Wait. I made a list

312
00:11:35,746 --> 00:11:37,211
of the reasons
we should be together.

313
00:11:37,245 --> 00:11:38,858
Number one: you're hot.

314
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,285
Number two: I'm hot.

315
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,804
Number three: Beth needs a dad.

316
00:11:44,882 --> 00:11:47,124
And why shouldn't it
be her actual dad?

317
00:11:47,328 --> 00:11:50,123
Look me in the eye and tell me
you don't feel something, too.

318
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:51,576
You want a mash-up?

319
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,470
We're the ultimate mash-up;

320
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,759
two things that maybe shouldn't
work together but do.

321
00:11:56,793 --> 00:11:58,446
I would lose my job.

322
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,006
Only if I told,
and I never would.

323
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:01,090
You have a crush.

324
00:12:01,124 --> 00:12:02,494
It's sweet and it's normal

325
00:12:02,544 --> 00:12:04,003
and you're gonna get over it.

326
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,727
I dream about us
being together.

327
00:12:05,924 --> 00:12:08,661
A real family.
Taking stupid pictures

328
00:12:08,718 --> 00:12:10,008
for our Hanukkah cards,

329
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:12,109
renting an RV and all of us
hitting Coachella.

330
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:14,200
(laughs) What's up with
that crib you ordered?

331
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,604
Is it still in pieces all over
your living room floor? Yes.

332
00:12:16,638 --> 00:12:19,100
See? You need me. I can help you
with stuff like that.

333
00:12:19,134 --> 00:12:20,499
Let me take care of it
this week.

334
00:12:20,672 --> 00:12:23,239
No, that's not gonna happen.
Why?

335
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:24,980
Because you're afraid you won't
be able to resist me?

336
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,447
I know that's why
you haven't had me

337
00:12:26,481 --> 00:12:28,015
back to babysit
since we made out.

338
00:12:28,073 --> 00:12:29,988
(mutters)

339
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:33,753
You know this is gonna happen.

340
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:35,749
(school bell rings)

341
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,773
Okay, guys, we have our work cut out
for us this week with this mash-off.

342
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:41,848
And The Trouble Tones have a
lot of powerful voices,

343
00:12:41,907 --> 00:12:44,359
so song selection is key
here. Any suggestions?

344
00:12:44,411 --> 00:12:45,862
What about The Clash?
Uh, The Police?

345
00:12:45,905 --> 00:12:46,944
REM!
No.

346
00:12:46,978 --> 00:12:47,807
Spice Girls.
Jonas Brothers.

347
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,136
Guys, no, no, we can't use

348
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:50,164
any of those bands.

349
00:12:50,196 --> 00:12:51,209
The only thing
they have in common

350
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,972
is that they all broke up,

351
00:12:52,974 --> 00:12:55,677
and right now the New Directions
need to feel united.

352
00:12:55,711 --> 00:12:57,050
I like what you're saying, Finn.

353
00:12:57,084 --> 00:12:58,600
It's not just about the music,
but where it comes from.

354
00:12:58,618 --> 00:13:00,101
Who do you think we should use?

355
00:13:00,103 --> 00:13:02,629
How about this?
People think Hall and Oates are

356
00:13:02,663 --> 00:13:04,295
famous for their
cool, puffy hair

357
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:06,257
and that dude's banging 'stache.
Awesome.

358
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:07,418
But also they're awesome

359
00:13:07,463 --> 00:13:09,200
for staying together
over the long haul.

360
00:13:09,234 --> 00:13:12,453
Just like us, despite
all their differences.

361
00:13:12,455 --> 00:13:15,361
I think we should give
the solo to the new guy.

362
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:16,939
Get him prepared
for what's in store

363
00:13:16,965 --> 00:13:18,109
when the stakes get high.

364
00:13:18,143 --> 00:13:20,348
Rory, I think
you'll do a good job.

365
00:13:20,397 --> 00:13:24,768
Thanks, Finn, but I don't think I'm
ready for that honor just yet.

366
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,031
Come on.
You're totally ready, Rory.

367
00:13:28,065 --> 00:13:30,703
You'll kill it.
We'll all help you.

368
00:13:30,705 --> 00:13:32,404
It's a great idea, Finn.

369
00:13:32,406 --> 00:13:34,486
Thanks.

370
00:13:34,502 --> 00:13:35,681
I'm losing patience.

371
00:13:35,706 --> 00:13:37,496
Why hasn't Child Protective
Services done anything

372
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,697
to Shelby yet?
I don't know.

373
00:13:38,713 --> 00:13:40,540
Wait. Did you do something
to screw this up already?

374
00:13:40,574 --> 00:13:42,529
You have to be
extra nice to Shelby

375
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:43,747
so that we can babysit more

376
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:45,162
because we've hardly
been over there,

377
00:13:45,196 --> 00:13:46,861
and we need to spend
as much time bonding

378
00:13:46,888 --> 00:13:49,225
with our baby as we can
so that when I get her,

379
00:13:49,337 --> 00:13:50,704
she doesn't freak out
when I hold her.

380
00:13:50,725 --> 00:13:51,930
I'm being really nice
to her, believe me.

381
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:53,999
Look, this isn't a game, okay?

382
00:13:54,175 --> 00:13:55,770
I know Shelby's
threatened by me.

383
00:13:55,821 --> 00:13:58,123
But I am willing to do whatever
it takes to get closer to her

384
00:13:58,317 --> 00:14:00,954
because closer to
her is closer to Beth.

385
00:14:08,555 --> 00:14:10,275
I would like
to join the Trouble Tones.

386
00:14:10,343 --> 00:14:12,777
I have to think about that.

387
00:14:12,848 --> 00:14:14,947
<i>RORY:
Thanks a million, Finn.</i>

388
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,024
I just want you to know
that no matter what,

389
00:14:17,058 --> 00:14:18,079
I have your back.

390
00:14:18,122 --> 00:14:19,896
Like when that girl
with the lips was saying

391
00:14:19,918 --> 00:14:22,679
you look like a whale, I wanted to
tell her that I think you look fine.

392
00:14:22,714 --> 00:14:23,879
I'm just sick of her

393
00:14:23,913 --> 00:14:25,458
talking smack
about me, you know?

394
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,759
Have you ever heard
of the term "trash talk"?

395
00:14:27,803 --> 00:14:29,588
Is that when you discuss trash?

396
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:32,078
No. In sports, it's when
one player insults another

397
00:14:32,091 --> 00:14:33,849
to try and get them off
their game.

398
00:14:33,876 --> 00:14:35,210
And Santana's trying
to demean us

399
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:37,930
to get inside of our heads
so that we remain losers.

400
00:14:37,968 --> 00:14:40,132
Well, it's time to start
getting inside of hers.

401
00:14:40,194 --> 00:14:41,889
Hey there, Orca.

402
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:45,540
Hey, Santana, you look
like an ass-less J.Lo.

403
00:14:45,564 --> 00:14:47,921
You're skinny
like all the crops

404
00:14:47,923 --> 00:14:49,149
failed on your family's farm.

405
00:14:49,216 --> 00:14:50,424
That is the lamest
thing I didn't

406
00:14:50,446 --> 00:14:52,233
understand a word of.
Not one word.

407
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,287
Is that really all that
you can come up with?

408
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,152
You seriously think that
you can out-insult me?

409
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,283
I'm from Lima Heights.
I was raised on insults.

410
00:14:59,285 --> 00:15:01,243
<i>It's how mi abuela put
me to sleep at night,</i>

411
00:15:01,245 --> 00:15:02,406
and she is not a nice lady.

412
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,263
You know, she tried
to sell me once?

413
00:15:04,297 --> 00:15:05,795
And it wasn't till I got
to kindergarten

414
00:15:05,836 --> 00:15:07,335
that I learned my name
wasn't "Garbage Face."

415
00:15:07,337 --> 00:15:09,319
Then we'll have
to settle this another way.

416
00:15:09,353 --> 00:15:11,737
Uh, today, after school.

417
00:15:11,773 --> 00:15:13,175
Bring your Trouble Tones.

418
00:15:13,231 --> 00:15:15,648
Are you suggesting
what I think you are?

419
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:16,603
Yeah, I am.

420
00:15:16,692 --> 00:15:17,989
Dodgeball.

421
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:18,839
(bell rings)

422
00:15:18,873 --> 00:15:21,159
(piano plays soft notes)

423
00:15:24,597 --> 00:15:26,659
Hey, Rachel.

424
00:15:26,684 --> 00:15:27,850
Hi.

425
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,794
As you might have heard,

426
00:15:29,822 --> 00:15:31,659
I'm applying to the New York
Academy of Dramatic Arts.

427
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,658
Ugh! All the girls who
beat me out in the auditions

428
00:15:33,694 --> 00:15:35,488
when I was in New York,
they all graduated from there.

429
00:15:35,523 --> 00:15:36,650
Well, my grades are perfect,

430
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:38,276
and I was the
lead in the school musical

431
00:15:38,454 --> 00:15:40,196
and I plan on winning
the election

432
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:41,600
for student class president,

433
00:15:41,648 --> 00:15:44,740
so I just need a letter, a
killer letter of recommendation.

434
00:15:44,742 --> 00:15:47,296
Wait. You're asking me
to write it?

435
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,878
Actually, I've, I've
already written it,

436
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,855
so all you would have to do is
just sign, and my resumé's

437
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:54,378
in there as well
with the letter, so...

438
00:15:54,438 --> 00:15:56,555
I thought that, you know,
your pedigree

439
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:58,240
as a National Champion
show-choir coach

440
00:15:58,274 --> 00:16:01,054
would just make some noise with
the admissions committee.

441
00:16:01,165 --> 00:16:02,182
Makes sense.

442
00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:06,097
Okay.

443
00:16:06,187 --> 00:16:08,110
Okay. Bye.

444
00:16:09,852 --> 00:16:12,397
I'm so proud of you.

445
00:16:13,661 --> 00:16:16,409
You are truly a star, Rachel.

446
00:16:18,097 --> 00:16:21,225
And it's all stillut
there in front of you.

447
00:16:21,227 --> 00:16:22,870
I'm not going to be
the first person

448
00:16:22,994 --> 00:16:25,155
to be a little jealous
of all the amazing things

449
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:26,753
you have lying ahead.

450
00:16:26,812 --> 00:16:31,093
I'm just going to be the only
one who's also cheering you on.

451
00:16:33,884 --> 00:16:36,843
Maybe you could come
to my Broadway debut.

452
00:16:36,877 --> 00:16:40,072
Ooh, don't try to stop me.
(both laugh)

453
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,250
Maybe you could write your own
version of the letter.

454
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:57,535
It's such an impressive resumé.

455
00:16:57,569 --> 00:17:02,294
You have the musical and all
the clubs and... maybe even

456
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:03,715
Student Council president.

457
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:07,267
I feel bad for all the kids
that don't have these

458
00:17:07,303 --> 00:17:09,590
big-ticket items in their CVs.

459
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:12,943
They don't have a chance in
hell of getting into NYADA.

460
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,210
This could be deadly.
I mean, facing our foes head-on

461
00:17:18,214 --> 00:17:20,007
without any adult supervision?

462
00:17:22,486 --> 00:17:26,000
So, uh, you know that our NYADA
applications are due next week.

463
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:27,968
I only need one more letter
of recommendation.

464
00:17:28,856 --> 00:17:30,160
I wrote to Patti
LuPone on her Web site,

465
00:17:30,173 --> 00:17:32,173
but I haven't heard
from her yet, so...

466
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:40,952
I-I really, I... I really miss
you, Kurt.

467
00:17:41,986 --> 00:17:43,099
And I just...

468
00:17:43,101 --> 00:17:46,036
I just... I really want
to be your friend again.

469
00:17:46,096 --> 00:17:47,662
Well, maybe you should've
thought of that

470
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,980
before you walked all over me

471
00:17:49,014 --> 00:17:51,487
in your borderline-sociopathic
climb to the top.

472
00:17:52,807 --> 00:17:54,375
(whistle blows)

473
00:17:54,425 --> 00:17:55,505
Let's roadhouse!

474
00:17:55,516 --> 00:17:57,465
Oh, it's on,
Pillsbury Dough Turd.

475
00:17:57,499 --> 00:17:58,861
RORY:
Excuse me.

476
00:17:58,897 --> 00:18:00,428
I've never heard of this game
of dodging balls before.

477
00:18:00,469 --> 00:18:02,891
What's the rules?
Don't die.

478
00:18:05,889 --> 00:18:07,359
Let's do this.

479
00:18:07,393 --> 00:18:10,556
(Pat Benatar's "Hit Me
with Your Best Shot" plays)

(girls cheer)

510
00:19:47,744 --> 00:19:49,330
Okay. Good game.

511
00:19:50,775 --> 00:19:51,785
Boy, oh, boy,
that was a cracker!

512
00:19:51,802 --> 00:19:53,416
What?

513
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,505
Whoa!

514
00:19:54,548 --> 00:19:55,638
(girls yell)

515
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,421
Stop it! Stop it!

516
00:19:59,455 --> 00:20:01,951
For God's sakes, he's bleeding!

517
00:20:01,972 --> 00:20:03,848
Maybe that's how the others
treat us around here,

518
00:20:03,893 --> 00:20:05,759
but we don't do this
to each other!

519
00:20:05,793 --> 00:20:07,014
We're better than this!

520
00:20:07,068 --> 00:20:08,891
God, calm down, Grandma.

521
00:20:08,939 --> 00:20:09,685
The game's over!

We still won.

00:20:16,307 --> 00:20:17,570
(school bell rings)

524
00:20:17,607 --> 00:20:19,102
(all spluttering)

525
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:21,783
Ladies,
vocal warm-ups can wait.

526
00:20:21,817 --> 00:20:23,807
Now, I was up half the night
thinking

527
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:25,165
about our mash-up
for the mash-off,

528
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,159
and it came to me... Adele.

529
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:28,580
I sound just like her.

530
00:20:28,622 --> 00:20:30,112
Dude, I love her.
She sounds like

531
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,918
what banana cream pie sounds
like when it sings.

532
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:33,306
I think it's a great idea,
Mercedes.

533
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,872
I think that we could really
kill with that stuff.

534
00:20:34,921 --> 00:20:36,984
Agreed. And now with that
decision out of the way,

535
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,821
I can stay focused on
my one-sided battle

536
00:20:38,823 --> 00:20:40,124
of wits with
the knuckle-dragger.

537
00:20:40,158 --> 00:20:43,023
Santana, the dodgeball thing was
fun, until the end, but enough.

538
00:20:43,057 --> 00:20:44,856
No, honey, I'm
just getting started.

539
00:20:44,893 --> 00:20:47,058
I'm the leader of this group
and I'm telling you

540
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,193
lay off those guys.

541
00:20:48,228 --> 00:20:49,773
I'm sorry.
The leader?

542
00:20:49,808 --> 00:20:52,722
Who died and
made you queen, Aretha?

543
00:20:52,776 --> 00:20:53,942
I brought you guys in

544
00:20:53,982 --> 00:20:56,283
and I came up with the
idea for our mash-up

545
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,139
while you were wasting time
trying to figure out how

546
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,408
to make Finn Hudson cry.

547
00:20:59,461 --> 00:21:02,527
So I nominate myself as
President of the Trouble Tones.

548
00:21:02,571 --> 00:21:04,490
All in favor?

549
00:21:04,524 --> 00:21:06,464
I'm not impressed
by your campaign.

550
00:21:06,488 --> 00:21:07,664
You didn't put any posters up.

551
00:21:07,698 --> 00:21:09,994
Four in favor means
Mercedes gets elected.

552
00:21:10,028 --> 00:21:11,875
And she's right.
We should all be focusg

553
00:21:11,906 --> 00:21:14,322
on winning because
we're better, not meaner.

554
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,170
Mr. Shue and I both agreed on
the ground rules.

555
00:21:16,204 --> 00:21:17,717
We play fair.

556
00:21:17,747 --> 00:21:19,296
I just don't have time
for this kind of thinking.

557
00:21:19,337 --> 00:21:20,750
Well, make time.

558
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,916
Because you are a star member
of this group

559
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:24,926
and you need to represent.

560
00:21:26,432 --> 00:21:28,550
¶ Stop the violence.

561
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:29,672
(both snicker)

562
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:32,707
Come on.
Okay. God, okay.

563
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:34,152
Look, I'll play fair.

564
00:21:34,195 --> 00:21:36,389
From now on, I will be so nice

565
00:21:36,404 --> 00:21:39,034
that cotton candy won't
melt in my mouth.

566
00:21:39,068 --> 00:21:40,739
That's really nice.
That's really nice.

567
00:21:40,772 --> 00:21:42,017
(bell ringing)

568
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:44,659
Hey, Tubs, can I talk
to you for a second?

569
00:21:44,689 --> 00:21:45,699
Hey, listen here.

570
00:21:45,733 --> 00:21:47,202
You can't make fun
of Finn anymore.

571
00:21:47,236 --> 00:21:49,543
Shut your potato hole.
I'm here to apologize.

572
00:21:49,577 --> 00:21:51,919
Rachel's right.
I haven't been fair to you.

573
00:21:51,946 --> 00:21:53,883
You're not fat.

574
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:57,382
I should know, I slept with you.
I mean, at some point,

575
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,345
I must have liked that
you look like a taco addict

576
00:21:59,377 --> 00:22:02,018
who's had one-too-many
back-alley liposuctions. Whoa.

577
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,134
Please stick a sock in it

578
00:22:03,173 --> 00:22:04,526
or ship yourself
back to Scotland.

579
00:22:04,554 --> 00:22:07,019
I'm trying to apologize
to Lumps the Clown.

580
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:08,062
I am sorry, Finn.

581
00:22:08,096 --> 00:22:09,552
I mean, really, I'm-I'm sorry

582
00:22:09,586 --> 00:22:11,553
that the New Directions
are going to get cshed

583
00:22:11,587 --> 00:22:13,241
by the Trouble Tones.

584
00:22:13,275 --> 00:22:15,255
I'm so sorry
that you have no talent.

585
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,782
I'm sorry that you sing
like you're getting

586
00:22:16,815 --> 00:22:19,562
your prostate checked
and you dance like you've been

587
00:22:19,596 --> 00:22:23,127
asleep for years
and someone just woke you up.

588
00:22:23,151 --> 00:22:24,461
Have fun riding on
Rachel's coattails

589
00:22:24,656 --> 00:22:25,878
for the rest of your life.

590
00:22:25,922 --> 00:22:28,114
Although, you know what,
I would just watch out for her

591
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,446
come holiday time,
if I were him,

592
00:22:29,468 --> 00:22:30,915
because if I were her, I'd stick

593
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,479
a stent in one of those boobs
and let the Finn blubber

594
00:22:33,514 --> 00:22:36,667
light the Hanukkah lamp
for eight magical nights.

595
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,458
Hey, Santana.

596
00:22:39,467 --> 00:22:42,830
Why don't u just
come out of the closet?

597
00:22:42,886 --> 00:22:44,919
You know, I think I know why

598
00:22:44,953 --> 00:22:47,665
you're so good at
tearing everybody else down.

599
00:22:47,731 --> 00:22:49,003
It's because you're constantly

600
00:22:49,051 --> 00:22:51,143
tearing yourself down,
because you can't admit

601
00:22:51,171 --> 00:22:52,921
to everybody that
you're in love with Brittany

602
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,643
and she might not love you back.

603
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:57,571
That must hurt,
to not be able to

604
00:22:57,615 --> 00:22:59,979
admit to everyone
how you really feel.

605
00:23:00,023 --> 00:23:02,246
You know what I think you are?

606
00:23:03,337 --> 00:23:06,031
A coward.

607
00:23:06,033 --> 00:23:08,029
See you at the mash-off.

608
00:23:09,075 --> 00:23:11,030
(school bell ringing)

609
00:23:12,115 --> 00:23:14,237
<i>Burt Hummel claims he doesn't
have a baboon heart.</i>

610
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,141
<i>He also claims he isn't married
to a donkey.</i>

611
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,521
Well, which is it, Burt Hummel?

612
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:19,891
<i>Baboon heart or donkey bride?</i>

613
00:23:19,925 --> 00:23:22,041
Donkeys have no place
in politics.

614
00:23:22,075 --> 00:23:25,210
They bite off children's fingers
and pee absolutely anywhere.

615
00:23:25,244 --> 00:23:27,062
Do we really need
another Washington politician

616
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:28,620
married to a pack animal?

617
00:23:28,622 --> 00:23:31,250
Don't let Burt Hummel
make an ass out of you, Ohio.

618
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:33,715
I'm Sue Sylvester,
and it's not personal.

619
00:23:33,749 --> 00:23:35,831
Will, you are my
campaign manager.

620
00:23:35,891 --> 00:23:38,043
You have got to do
something about this!

621
00:23:38,077 --> 00:23:39,417
She's killing us!

622
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,629
You are on the right side of
the issues voters care about.

623
00:23:41,631 --> 00:23:43,640
You know what it's like
to run a small business.

624
00:23:43,668 --> 00:23:45,381
When the recession hit,
you took a pay cut

625
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,164
so you didn't have to fire
a single employee.

626
00:23:47,199 --> 00:23:48,804
Will, if you don't start
fighting fire with fire,

627
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:50,168
we are both going to lose.

628
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,172
I'm going to lose the race,

629
00:23:52,207 --> 00:23:54,109
you're going to lose your job.

630
00:23:54,143 --> 00:23:55,770
Put your thinking cap on.

631
00:23:55,804 --> 00:23:58,708
PUCK:
Oh, who's got your nose?

632
00:23:58,745 --> 00:24:00,444
Where'd it go?

633
00:24:00,478 --> 00:24:01,490
Huh?

634
00:24:01,593 --> 00:24:02,719
There it is!

635
00:24:02,721 --> 00:24:04,915
It's magic!

636
00:24:05,124 --> 00:24:06,811
Yeah.

637
00:24:08,861 --> 00:24:10,811
Sorry, I should probably
be helping more.

638
00:24:10,827 --> 00:24:13,215
I didn't know the directions
were gonna be the foreign kind

639
00:24:13,266 --> 00:24:14,591
with weird pictures
instead of English.

640
00:24:14,593 --> 00:24:16,118
It's okay.

641
00:24:17,591 --> 00:24:20,049
She likes you.
You're good with her.

642
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:23,501
That's 'cause she's the best
little girl in the whole world.

643
00:24:23,608 --> 00:24:24,692
Whoa!

644
00:24:24,726 --> 00:24:26,991
Oh, where'd it go?

645
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,856
(whistles)

646
00:24:28,858 --> 00:24:30,306
Isn't that right, Monkeyface?

647
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,797
(chuckles)

648
00:24:32,831 --> 00:24:33,947
Can I have her for a sec?

649
00:24:33,977 --> 00:24:34,936
Sure.

650
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:36,332
Go see Mama.

651
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,672
Hi. Hi.
That's a good girl.

652
00:24:37,694 --> 00:24:41,116
Want to play here
and give Mommy a little break?

653
00:24:41,143 --> 00:24:43,247
I got to come clean
about something.

654
00:24:43,297 --> 00:24:46,522
When Quinn and I
babysat for you,

655
00:24:46,532 --> 00:24:48,353
she put a bunch of stuff
around here

656
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:50,255
to make you look like
an unfit mother.

657
00:24:52,062 --> 00:24:53,811
And then she called
Child Protective Services.

658
00:24:53,845 --> 00:24:55,602
But I came
and got rid of it all.

659
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,848
Why would she do that to me?

660
00:24:57,882 --> 00:24:59,130
Because she wants
to get Beth back again.

661
00:24:59,132 --> 00:25:00,260
I did, too.

662
00:25:00,294 --> 00:25:01,334
I thought we'd be,

663
00:25:01,368 --> 00:25:02,824
you know, good parents.

664
00:25:02,858 --> 00:25:05,575
It was wrong and stupid
and totally selfish.

665
00:25:05,643 --> 00:25:08,583
I'm really, really sorry.

666
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,669
I...

667
00:25:12,698 --> 00:25:14,845
(Beth cooing)

668
00:25:14,879 --> 00:25:18,910
I always thought of Beth
as an accident.

669
00:25:18,912 --> 00:25:20,409
But she's no accident.

670
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,908
Quinn and I gave her life...

671
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:31,661
but somehow God or nature
or whatever

672
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:34,872
meant for you and her
to be together.

673
00:25:34,906 --> 00:25:37,589
You were always
meant to be her mother.

674
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:43,303
And I'd like to be
part of her life, too.

675
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:50,164
Hi.

676
00:25:52,106 --> 00:25:55,409
Welcome, everyone, to day one
of the first annual

677
00:25:55,437 --> 00:25:57,518
McKinley High Mash-Off!

678
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:59,819
(cheering, excited chatter)

679
00:25:59,821 --> 00:26:01,974
Okay, a couple of ground rules.

680
00:26:02,035 --> 00:26:03,603
Everyone, therwill be

681
00:26:03,776 --> 00:26:05,272
no heckling of any kind, okay?

682
00:26:05,304 --> 00:26:07,478
Ms. Corcoran, the Trouble Tones
are all fired up.

683
00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:09,541
Fine, fine.

684
00:26:09,573 --> 00:26:11,402
Don't worry, I can do it.

685
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:13,452
I'm gonna hit
that F below middle C,

686
00:26:13,495 --> 00:26:14,558
just like Adele.

687
00:26:14,592 --> 00:26:16,094
WILL:
All right, here we go.

688
00:26:16,129 --> 00:26:17,600
Finn will represent
the New Directions;

689
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:20,482
Santana, the Trouble Tones
for the rock-paper-scissor

690
00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:23,322
face-off to see who will
perform first, all right?

691
00:26:23,378 --> 00:26:25,537
Let's get it going!

692
00:26:25,574 --> 00:26:27,219
Let's do this.

693
00:26:27,249 --> 00:26:29,051
SANTANA and FINN:
One, two, three!

694
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,917
Yeah! Yeah!

695
00:26:30,951 --> 00:26:31,967
Okay, paper covers rock.

696
00:26:32,001 --> 00:26:33,386
New Directions, take the stage!

697
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:34,956
A kiss for the winner.

698
00:26:34,974 --> 00:26:38,844
(Hall & Oates' "You Make
My Dreams Come True" playing)

699
00:26:38,894 --> 00:26:41,089
¶ What I want, you've got

700
00:26:41,123 --> 00:26:43,073
¶ It might be hard to handle

701
00:26:43,111 --> 00:26:46,511
¶ Like the flame
that burns the candle ¶

702
00:26:46,562 --> 00:26:48,896
¶ The candle feeds the flame

703
00:26:48,938 --> 00:26:50,136
<i>¶ Eh, eh ¶</i>

704
00:26:50,154 --> 00:26:51,849
¶ What I've got's full stock

705
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:54,105
¶ Of thoughts and dreams
that scatter ¶

706
00:26:54,139 --> 00:26:56,772
¶ You pull them all together

707
00:26:56,806 --> 00:26:59,283
¶ And how I can't explain

708
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:01,162
¶ Oh, yeah, well, well, you

709
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,575
¶ I can't go for that

710
00:27:02,611 --> 00:27:04,362
<i>¶ Ooh, ooh ¶</i>

711
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,832
¶ You make my dreams come true

712
00:27:05,864 --> 00:27:10,034
¶ I can't go for that,
I can't go for that ¶

713
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,503
¶ Well, well, well, you

714
00:27:11,537 --> 00:27:13,623
¶ I can't go for that

715
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:16,592
¶ Oh, yeah, you make my dreams
come true ¶

716
00:27:16,627 --> 00:27:20,601
¶ I can't go for that,
I can't go for that ¶

717
00:27:20,635 --> 00:27:25,048
¶ On a night when bad dreams
become a screamer ¶

718
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,765
¶ When they're messing
with the dreamer ¶

719
00:27:27,805 --> 00:27:31,474
¶ I can laugh it in the face

720
00:27:31,508 --> 00:27:33,388
¶ Twist and shout my way out

721
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:35,606
¶ And wrap yourself around me

722
00:27:35,644 --> 00:27:38,646
¶ 'Cause I ain't the way
you found me ¶

723
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,395
¶ And I'll never be the same

724
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:42,849
¶ Oh, yeah, well, 'cause you

725
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,874
<i>¶ I can't go for that
¶ Ooh, ooh ¶</i>

726
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,407
¶ Oh, yeah, you make my dreams
come true ¶

727
00:27:47,455 --> 00:27:51,877
¶ I can't go for that,
I can't go for that ¶

728
00:27:51,913 --> 00:27:55,413
¶ Oh...

729
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,888
¶ I'm down on my daydream

730
00:27:57,917 --> 00:28:00,919
¶ But that sleepwalk
should be over by now ¶

731
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:02,217
¶ I know

732
00:28:02,257 --> 00:28:03,968
¶ Yeah, you

733
00:28:04,004 --> 00:28:05,719
¶ Ah

734
00:28:05,758 --> 00:28:08,183
¶ I'll do anything
that you want me to ¶

735
00:28:08,217 --> 00:28:10,759
¶ Yeah, I

736
00:28:10,811 --> 00:28:12,176
¶ Do almost anything

737
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,348
¶ You make my dreams come true

738
00:28:14,382 --> 00:28:16,013
¶ I can't go for that

739
00:28:16,047 --> 00:28:18,738
¶ Oh, you make my dreams
come true ¶

740
00:28:18,772 --> 00:28:20,243
¶ I can't go for that

741
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:25,779
¶ You make my dreams
come true. ¶

742
00:28:25,835 --> 00:28:26,946
(applause)

743
00:28:37,904 --> 00:28:38,900
Burt.

744
00:28:38,979 --> 00:28:40,223
Hey, I was worried you
weren't going to make it.

745
00:28:40,225 --> 00:28:42,032
Are you kidding?

746
00:28:42,071 --> 00:28:43,152
I wouldn't miss
this for the world.

747
00:28:43,186 --> 00:28:45,368
Polls have you in first place.

748
00:28:45,403 --> 00:28:47,072
Almost everyone
loves the new ad.

749
00:28:47,121 --> 00:28:48,643
Almost everyone?

750
00:28:48,672 --> 00:28:49,871
Well, that ad was bulletproof.

751
00:28:49,893 --> 00:28:51,925
I accused Burt Hummel
of using his tire shop

752
00:28:51,989 --> 00:28:53,874
to sexually assault automobiles.

753
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,296
What's not to like about that?

754
00:28:56,339 --> 00:28:57,749
Hey, Ms. C.

755
00:28:57,811 --> 00:28:59,390
Quiet, please, children.

756
00:28:59,422 --> 00:29:01,224
Welcome one and all

757
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:04,566
to McKinley High's senior class
presidential debate.

758
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,123
Such a magnificent
turnout reflects

759
00:29:07,175 --> 00:29:09,451
this school's passion
for democracy.

760
00:29:09,485 --> 00:29:12,735
And also, a reminder:
it is against school policy

761
00:29:12,737 --> 00:29:16,268
to pass gas into jars
to be sold in the cafeteria.

762
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:21,691
And now, our first candidate,
Rick "The Stick" Nelson.

763
00:29:21,725 --> 00:29:23,856
(cheering, boys chanting)

764
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:24,940
Stick! Stick! Stick! Stick!

765
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:28,514
So, I was talking to my dad,

766
00:29:28,536 --> 00:29:30,842
who says that since he pays
taxes and stuff,

767
00:29:30,844 --> 00:29:34,286
like, for teachers, which pretty
much means that we're your boss.

768
00:29:34,288 --> 00:29:36,117
So I think it's time

769
00:29:36,221 --> 00:29:38,222
that the teachers started
doing what we say.

770
00:29:38,256 --> 00:29:40,602
And how about you stop talking
in class, Mrs. Janicek?

771
00:29:40,641 --> 00:29:42,458
Everything you have to say
is boring!

772
00:29:42,518 --> 00:29:43,630
(cheering, chanting)

773
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,287
Vote Rick the Stick!

774
00:29:45,322 --> 00:29:49,264
Tornadoes are nature's
most destructive force.

775
00:29:49,266 --> 00:29:51,225
These violent storms
have ravaged America,

776
00:29:51,306 --> 00:29:53,489
crippling communities
all across our land.

777
00:29:53,695 --> 00:29:55,793
Isn't it time we take a stand?

778
00:29:55,874 --> 00:29:57,948
If you honor me with being
your next class president,

779
00:29:57,981 --> 00:30:00,119
I will make tornadoes
illegal at McKinley,

780
00:30:00,151 --> 00:30:01,949
keeping you and your families
at our school

781
00:30:01,987 --> 00:30:04,006
safe from
their murderous rampages.

782
00:30:04,008 --> 00:30:08,163
Also, on Tuesdays, uh,
I pledge to go topless.

783
00:30:08,209 --> 00:30:10,129
(cheering)

784
00:30:13,114 --> 00:30:14,382
Whoo!

785
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,168
(scattered applause)

786
00:30:23,284 --> 00:30:25,860
Hello, I'm Kurt Hummel.

787
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:28,264
Um, the past few weeks,

788
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:31,266
I've tried to address
the real problem

789
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:34,040
of obesity at this school.

790
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:39,310
But my opponents chose empty
promises and smear tactics.

791
00:30:39,312 --> 00:30:42,439
Although she knows it to be
untrue, my opponent Brittany

792
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:44,618
stated that my face
was used as a template

793
00:30:44,774 --> 00:30:48,625
for Hasbro's successful line
of My Little Ponies.

794
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:50,692
Well, I refuse to be bullied.

795
00:30:52,805 --> 00:30:56,155
In fact, I refuse
to let anyone be bullied.

796
00:30:56,379 --> 00:30:59,552
Today, I want to take it
one step further.

797
00:30:59,587 --> 00:31:03,546
I would like to hereby pledge
to ban dodgeball

798
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,453
at McKinley High.

799
00:31:10,282 --> 00:31:14,554
Since its invention in 1831
by Silas W. Mangold,

800
00:31:14,589 --> 00:31:16,202
dodgeball has been used as

801
00:31:16,393 --> 00:31:18,566
a schoolyard instrument
of suppression.

802
00:31:18,615 --> 00:31:21,040
It's violent, it's painful,
it's humiliating,

803
00:31:21,074 --> 00:31:23,182
and I believe
that it's an equivalent

804
00:31:23,296 --> 00:31:24,415
to modern-day stoning.

805
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:28,853
Let's end dodgeball
at Minley High

806
00:31:28,855 --> 00:31:32,962
and send a strong message
that violence isn't okay.

807
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,479
Hello, I'm Rachel Berry,

808
00:31:38,492 --> 00:31:41,187
and I have campaigned
for president on a crusade

809
00:31:41,221 --> 00:31:43,185
for school book covers,

810
00:31:43,219 --> 00:31:45,426
a plan to save the school
thousands of dollars.

811
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,759
(boys catcalling)

812
00:31:46,806 --> 00:31:47,893
Knock it off!

813
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:51,394
While I still consider this plan

814
00:31:51,428 --> 00:31:53,841
an inspired stroke
of political genius,

815
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:56,765
I hereby withdraw my candidacy

816
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,595
and urge you all to vote
for Kurt Hummel.

817
00:32:01,873 --> 00:32:03,584
He's the only candidate

818
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:05,082
here today who never
went negative.

819
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:09,284
He-He's the one who deserves
to be president.

820
00:32:11,469 --> 00:32:14,369
That's why I-I'm casting my vote
for Kurt Hummel.

821
00:32:14,403 --> 00:32:16,669
Vote Hummel, McKinley.

822
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:20,504
Vote for Kurt.

823
00:32:29,757 --> 00:32:30,747
(school bell ringing)

824
00:32:35,085 --> 00:32:36,116
Why'd you do it?

825
00:32:36,148 --> 00:32:38,817
I should have
withdrawn from the race

826
00:32:39,034 --> 00:32:40,578
when I got the lead
in the musical.

827
00:32:40,612 --> 00:32:42,168
You needed the resumé boost

828
00:32:42,202 --> 00:32:44,126
to get into NYADA.

829
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:47,344
You're already so spectacular.

830
00:32:47,346 --> 00:32:51,534
But being senior class president
will just put you over the top.

831
00:32:51,577 --> 00:32:55,151
Only Rachel Berrcould perk up
an old boring high school debate

832
00:32:55,209 --> 00:32:56,579
with such a riveting twist.

833
00:32:56,613 --> 00:32:58,659
Drama queen. I know.

834
00:32:58,723 --> 00:33:02,569
But I just... I-I hated
you hating me.

835
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:05,464
Me, too. Scowling gives
you forehead lines,

836
00:33:05,466 --> 00:33:08,553
and I'm way too
young for Botox.

837
00:33:08,602 --> 00:33:11,642
I guess I was just, you know,
focusing on my dream

838
00:33:11,644 --> 00:33:13,930
of going to New York and
getting into NYADA, but...

839
00:33:13,964 --> 00:33:17,600
then realized that part of that
dream is going there with you.

840
00:33:17,681 --> 00:33:20,241
So, now I am all
about helping you win.

841
00:33:20,243 --> 00:33:22,489
Consider me your
campaign slave.

842
00:33:25,245 --> 00:33:27,240
I'm gonna hug you now, okay?
Okay.

843
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:28,356
Okay!

844
00:33:28,416 --> 00:33:30,334
(sighs) Thank you!

845
00:33:35,982 --> 00:33:37,861
So, about the
whole pastie thing...

846
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:40,164
Let's just quit while
we're ahead, doll.

847
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,000
Hey. I was... I was in
the neighborhood,

848
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:49,650
so I thought I'd drop this off
for Beth.

849
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,235
- I just got her down so...
- I left a bunch

850
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,863
of voicemails trying to find a
good time to come by.

851
00:33:53,896 --> 00:33:55,804
And you never gave me
a straight answer

852
00:33:55,838 --> 00:33:57,207
about when I can join
the Trouble Tones.

853
00:33:57,236 --> 00:33:59,231
I don't think it's
a very good idea.

854
00:33:59,348 --> 00:34:01,034
Well, Mr. Schuester
won't miss me.

855
00:34:01,078 --> 00:34:04,592
I reached out to you.

856
00:34:04,594 --> 00:34:06,353
I came back here so that you

857
00:34:06,355 --> 00:34:07,857
and my daughter could
have a relationship.

858
00:34:07,891 --> 00:34:11,051
Oh, please, I know all about
the hot sauce and the book

859
00:34:11,085 --> 00:34:12,635
and everything else
you planted here.

860
00:34:12,663 --> 00:34:14,812
You think they were just gonna
come here and find those things

861
00:34:14,848 --> 00:34:17,249
- and hand my baby over to you?
- She's my baby.

862
00:34:17,251 --> 00:34:19,384
You have no idea what it means
to be a mother.

863
00:34:19,397 --> 00:34:21,594
It's not about whose
body she comes out of;

864
00:34:21,629 --> 00:34:24,762
it's about accepting the fact
that you don'tatter anymore...

865
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:27,680
that your feelings, and that
your life and that your body

866
00:34:27,714 --> 00:34:32,147
they all come second to making sure
that that child is happy and safe.

867
00:34:32,187 --> 00:34:33,691
Is that why you gave yours up
for money?

868
00:34:33,725 --> 00:34:35,790
At least I did what I
thought was best for my baby.

869
00:34:35,821 --> 00:34:38,270
You were just a cash whore!

870
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:42,577
I don't feel comfortable with
you being around Beth anymore.

871
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,766
Is Puck going to
get to see her?

872
00:34:51,498 --> 00:34:53,556
Was he the one who told you?
We're done here.

873
00:34:53,702 --> 00:34:56,761
I hope you this as a
wake-up call.

874
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:58,795
Just because you take out
your nose ring

875
00:34:58,844 --> 00:35:02,638
and dye your hair blonde again
doesn't make you any less lost.

876
00:35:04,304 --> 00:35:06,602
I think you need to stop making
fun of Finn.

877
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:07,800
You're being really harsh.

878
00:35:07,851 --> 00:35:09,884
Manatees have
really thick skin.

879
00:35:09,918 --> 00:35:13,363
Santana, Coach Sue needs you in
her office right away.

880
00:35:13,397 --> 00:35:16,087
(school bell rings)

881
00:35:16,121 --> 00:35:17,310
What's going on?

882
00:35:17,419 --> 00:35:19,864
Have a seat, Santana.

883
00:35:25,121 --> 00:35:27,716
I'm afraid we have
some bad news,

884
00:35:27,756 --> 00:35:30,625
and I think I
might be to blame.

885
00:35:30,673 --> 00:35:32,741
Oh, you think?
Watch your blood pressure, Bubbles.

886
00:35:32,775 --> 00:35:35,576
In my campaign to become
Ohio's newest congresswoman,

887
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:38,649
I've said some things
that are not true,

888
00:35:38,651 --> 00:35:41,021
and I don't feel good about it.

889
00:35:42,101 --> 00:35:44,308
I set the tone for this
campaign,

890
00:35:44,346 --> 00:35:47,064
and now I'm afraid
my slanderous chickens

891
00:35:47,091 --> 00:35:49,294
have come home to roost.

892
00:35:49,328 --> 00:35:50,806
Santana, you should know
that I have the phone number

893
00:35:50,843 --> 00:35:52,632
of a counselor who
specializes in this.

894
00:35:52,643 --> 00:35:55,122
It's something that, uh, I've
been through first-hand,

895
00:35:55,156 --> 00:35:57,240
and I'd be willing to talk your
family through it.

896
00:35:57,284 --> 00:35:58,987
What are you... What
are you talking about?

897
00:35:59,114 --> 00:36:01,538
Reggie "the Sauce"
Salazar sent me

898
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:04,245
an advance copy of his latest
campaign ad.

899
00:36:04,271 --> 00:36:06,944
It turns out he has a niece
who goes to this school,

900
00:36:06,993 --> 00:36:08,953
and she overheard a conversati

901
00:36:08,987 --> 00:36:11,710
a couple of days ago
between you and Finn Hudson.

902
00:36:15,385 --> 00:36:17,570
<i>OMINOUS VOICE: Sue Sylvester
wants to represent Ohio.</i>

903
00:36:17,703 --> 00:36:19,145
<i>She says she shares your
values.</i>

904
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:21,255
<i>If that's true, boy do we have
some questions...</i>

905
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:23,385
<i>If you're so into family
values, why did you promote</i>

906
00:36:23,426 --> 00:36:25,034
<i>a lesbian student to be
your head cheerleader?</i>

907
00:36:25,062 --> 00:36:27,294
<i>And when did you plan on
telling Ohio families?</i>

908
00:36:27,328 --> 00:36:29,967
<i>Here's another question: Why
don't you have a husband, Sue?</i>

909
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:31,769
<i>Is there something you're not
telling us?</i>

910
00:36:31,821 --> 00:36:34,016
<i>Sue Sylvester.
So many questions.</i>

911
00:36:34,018 --> 00:36:37,487
(sobbing): I can't believe this
is happening.

912
00:36:37,521 --> 00:36:38,556
I'm so sorry.

913
00:36:38,575 --> 00:36:41,476
I haven't even told
my parents yet.

914
00:36:44,732 --> 00:36:47,649
(Adele's "Rumor Has It" plays)

915
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:55,162
<i>¶ Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ¶</i>

916
00:36:55,196 --> 00:36:58,293
¶ She, she ain't real

917
00:36:58,329 --> 00:37:02,578
¶ She ain't gonna be able to
love you like I will ¶

918
00:37:02,643 --> 00:37:06,837
¶ Sure, she's got it all

919
00:37:06,871 --> 00:37:12,931
¶ But baby, is that really what
you want? ¶

920
00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:13,913
(music pauses)

921
00:37:16,712 --> 00:37:20,020
¶ Bless your soul, you've got
your head in the clouds ¶

922
00:37:20,054 --> 00:37:22,219
¶ You made a fool out of you

923
00:37:22,235 --> 00:37:24,190
¶ And, boy, she's bringing
you down ¶

924
00:37:24,224 --> 00:37:28,692
¶ She made your heart melt,
but you're cold to the core ¶

925
00:37:28,726 --> 00:37:31,415
¶ Now rumor has it she ain't got
your love anymore ¶

926
00:37:31,448 --> 00:37:33,195
<i>¶ Rumor has it, ooh ¶</i>

927
00:37:33,229 --> 00:37:35,452
<i>¶ Rumor has it, ooh ¶</i>

928
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,417
<i>¶ Rumor has it, ooh ¶</i>

929
00:37:37,451 --> 00:37:39,205
<i>¶ Rumor has it, ooh ¶</i>

930
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:41,339
¶ Don't forget me

931
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:43,621
<i>¶ I beg ¶ Rumor has it, ooh ¶</i>

932
00:37:43,681 --> 00:37:48,382
<i>¶ I remember, you said
¶ Rumor has it ¶</i>

933
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:51,013
<i>I heard ¶
¶ Ooh... ¶</i>

934
00:37:51,049 --> 00:37:54,969
¶ That you settled down

935
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:58,851
¶ That you found a girl

936
00:37:58,907 --> 00:38:04,196
¶ And you're married now

937
00:38:04,235 --> 00:38:06,694
<i>¶ I heard
¶ Ooh... ¶</i>

938
00:38:06,731 --> 00:38:11,031
¶ That your dreams came true

939
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:14,438
¶ Guess she gave you things

940
00:38:14,451 --> 00:38:17,576
¶ I didn't give to you

941
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:20,658
<i>¶ Whoa!
¶ Rumor has it, ooh</i>

942
00:38:20,714 --> 00:38:22,609
<i>¶ Rumor has it, ooh ¶</i>

943
00:38:22,632 --> 00:38:25,746
<i>¶ Yeah, baby
¶ Rumor has it, ooh ¶</i>

944
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,834
¶ Don't forget me

945
00:38:27,895 --> 00:38:29,672
<i>¶ Rumor has it, ooh ¶ ¶ I beg</i>

946
00:38:29,721 --> 00:38:33,393
¶ I remember, you said

947
00:38:33,423 --> 00:38:35,174
<i>¶ Rumor has it, ooh ¶</i>

948
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:39,520
¶ Never mind, I'll find someone
like you ¶

949
00:38:39,574 --> 00:38:41,561
<i>¶ Rumor has it, ooh</i>

950
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:46,239
¶ I wish nothing but the best

951
00:38:46,267 --> 00:38:49,492
<i>¶ For you, too ¶ Rumor has it ¶</i>

952
00:38:49,521 --> 00:38:51,993
¶ Don't forget me

953
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:53,243
¶ I beg

954
00:38:53,279 --> 00:38:57,652
¶ I remember, you said

955
00:38:57,661 --> 00:38:59,914
¶ Sometimes it lasts in love

956
00:38:59,947 --> 00:39:04,793
¶ But sometimes
it hurts instead ¶

957
00:39:04,827 --> 00:39:09,004
¶ Sometimes it lasts
in love, but sometimes ¶

958
00:39:09,023 --> 00:39:14,499
¶ It hurts instead...

959
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:17,167
What did you just say to her?

960
00:39:18,236 --> 00:39:20,660
- I said I thought you were great.
- You're lying.

961
00:39:20,661 --> 00:39:22,323
- No, he literally just said that.
- Did you tell her, too?

962
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:25,031
- Santana...
- Everyone's gonna know now, because of you!

963
00:39:25,101 --> 00:39:27,183
The whole school already knows,
and you know what? They don't care!

964
00:39:27,185 --> 00:39:30,985
- Not just the school, you idiot... everyone.
- What are you talking...?
