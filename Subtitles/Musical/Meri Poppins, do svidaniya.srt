PART ONE
"Lady Perfection"

30
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,269
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning. Any news?

31
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,831
Nothing much, sir. 3 murders,
107 petty larcenies,

32
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,232
an earthquake in South Cockatoo
and...

33
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,871
... a flying saucer, sir.
Anything new on your street?

34
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,079
- New? On our street?
- Hurry up, hurry up!

35
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,436
- On our street?
- I'm coming, mister Willkins.

36
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,148
I'm waiting. Hurry!

37
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,550
I couldn't sleep all night,
I am so eager to hear...

38
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,957
... the end of the story with
Astute Bill!

39
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,110
In last night's edition the
fearless detective finds out...

40
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,832
... that the stolen diamonds are
in the possession of a woman.

41
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,958
I hope you will find out who she
is, Mr. Willkins. - Thank you.

42
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,118
Eddie! My boy went out without
a raincoat!

43
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,075
Eddie! Don't you ever come near
those awful stray dogs!

44
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,395
- Ed, come home!
- Good morning, miss Lark.

45
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,990
Good morning. Just look
at this monster.

46
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,636
To say nothing of his pedigree.
Half poodle, half terrier.

47
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,636
And he took the worst from
both.

48
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,390
Here's your "Dog Herald" with
the results of the exhibition.

49
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,948
Thank you so much.

50
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,077
How many times did I tell you
to stay away from stray dogs!

51
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,311
Go away, fleabag!

52
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,076
Stay where you are!

53
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,590
- Good morning, admiral Boom.
- Are they here yet?

54
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,349
- Thank god, not yet!
- The flying saucer still there?

55
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,116
The papers write that chances
of aliens coming here are...

56
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,351
I don't care what they write!

57
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,638
If there are chances, that
means there is a threat.

58
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,596
- Put your stupid papers into
the mailbox. - Yes, sir.

59
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,558
Wait! What is the weather
outside?

60
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,070
The cool westward wind
intensifies, admiral.

61
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,519
The devices fail me again!
God damn my spleen!

62
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,036
Morning, mister Robertson.
Writing a new song?

63
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,715
- What's it about this time?
- Listen.

64
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,868
Hey you, villainous nanny Cathy,

65
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,839
You left, and the children
have no nanny.

66
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,837
There's noise and din
all over the place.

67
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,312
All hell broke loose without
a nanny!

68
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,030
And I go on condemning her, only
I didn't write that yet.

69
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,233
My sympathy. It is your ad in
the morning paper:

70
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,988
"Jane and Michael Banks, to say
nothing of their parents..."

71
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,350
- And I should add, their uncle.
- Oh yes, uncle.

72
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,035
"... are in need of a good nanny
or governess...

73
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,635
who would go for a meagre
salary. Urgent." - Yes.

74
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,150
I hope you wouldn't have
to wait long.

75
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,035
Hold this, will you?

76
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,996
Hey you, underground admiral!

77
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,800
Quit the masquerade!

78
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,109
Join in.

79
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,392
Hey you, underground admiral!

80
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,918
Quit your masquerade!

81
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,677
Underground admiral,
quit your masquerade!

82
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,715
"... a good nanny... meagre
salary. Address: 17, Cherry St."

83
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,637
Now all we have to do is wait
until nannies come queuing...

84
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,992
... at our porch, eager to get
the most meagre salary.

85
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,669
If we can't offer a big salary,

86
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,592
... it is better that we say so
in the first place.

87
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,594
So far, if crowds do gather
at your porch,

88
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,434
... it is to marvel at your
dear brother - the idler.

89
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,712
Don't you dare call him that.
He writes songs!

90
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,990
He needs peace and seclusion,
and I personally...

91
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,352
I personally understand him
very well.

92
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,154
Father, what else do they write
about the flying saucer?

93
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,830
Maybe. If I were you I would
mind...

94
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,429
my own saucers and not stick my
nose where it doesn't belong.

95
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,872
Oh, my god!

96
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,876
Another earthquake in
South Cockatoo!

97
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,511
Your children are left
without a nanny!

98
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,152
But I just bought shares
of "Cockatoo-orange Co."

99
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,631
I think I am on the verge of
having a nervous breakdown.

100
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,798
You don't concern yourself with
problems of world economy!

101
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,319
I'm enough concerned with having
to economize on everything.

102
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,594
If you wouldn't...

103
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,470
... waste so much time on your
"Cherry Street Women's League",

104
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,029
... I'm sure the issue with the
nanny wouldn't be that acute.

105
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,669
So you think women of Cherry St.
must bear with admiral Boom's...

106
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,791
Admiral Boom is not a fool in
the first place...

107
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,595
A reliable cover from aliens
wouldn't hurt nowadays.

108
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,754
- Yes. - George, what are
you conceiving this time?

109
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,468
Nothing. Only to go to work.

110
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,189
- Make money. Make money,
darling. - Father!

111
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,592
Father! You promised to tell us
where money comes from.

112
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,033
Your mother will better tell you
where it disappears.

113
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,432
Have you finished your milk?
Go to your bedroom and play.

114
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,479
Did you hear what your father
said? March to your room!

115
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,156
- Jane.
- I'm coming.

116
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,152
There was a blue luminescence,
then the object disappeared.

117
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,229
Sir Timothy Green from the
Observer smiled skeptically...

118
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,637
and remarked that people are
disposed to wishful thinking.

119
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,160
I can only say that the Eastern
wind is intensifying,

120
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,199
the night will be cool, and
tomorrow it will start raining.

121
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,395
Naum Nohl from the Times wrote:
"Bad weather is popular today".

122
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,757
But let's not grieve, instead
let us think about our health.

123
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,833
And now - morning exercises!

124
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,548
- Shall we play "Hit-ship"?
- We played it yesterday.

125
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,758
What's new?

126
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,437
Admiral Boom is wiping his
periscope. And cursing.

127
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,113
- It's his favorite "God damn
my spleen!"? - Can't hear.

128
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:26,232
Mrs. Lark came out into the
garden, Robert is in his tent.

129
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,555
Michael! What was that?

130
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,036
- I think it was it.
- What?

131
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,675
The saucer!

132
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,315
Remember, dad said they were
luminescent.

133
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,878
Look!

134
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,708
My name is Mary Poppins.

135
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,189
Yes, yes, of course. Please
do come in.

136
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,915
You'll see, they are very
obedient children.

137
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,390
And you will have no
problems with them.

138
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,996
You do have references from
the Nannies' Union?

139
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,869
My rule: no references.

140
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,875
- But everyone must...
- A very old-fashioned custom.

141
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,200
Totally outdated and useless.

142
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,036
Please. The children's
room is upstairs.

143
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,949
Jane, Michael, meet your new
nanny - Mary Poppins.

144
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,876
So it's a deal then?

145
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,836
Almost. If I find it suitable.

146
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,317
- Do you want to take us?
- Michael, mind your manners.

147
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,869
I accept the job,

148
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,552
... Mrs. Banks.

149
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,271
"I accept the job, Mrs. Banks".

150
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,110
One would think she was
doing us a favor.

151
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,792
Why not?

152
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,591
Dammit! The Antarctic Bank
went bankrupt!

153
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,955
My money is lost again.
I knew it! I knew it!

154
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,398
I'm in stress!

155
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,118
When you were a common clerk, we
weren't afraid of anything.

156
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,996
A man is bound to get lucky
some time.

157
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,513
Mr. Banks, would you turn off
that music, if you please.

158
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,600
I personally prefer live music.

159
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,349
- What's live music?
- All in it's time.

160
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,878
It is live music that gives me
real pleasure.

161
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,873
I hope, you feel the same.

162
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,111
And remember once and for all:

163
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,669
... Mary Poppins doesn't repeat
twice.

164
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,354
She must have come here
in a flying saucer.

165
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,112
I knew right away. You are a
humanoid.

166
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,073
You came so suddenly, as if you
were carried by a gust of wind.

167
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,113
It is exactly so.

168
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,033
Do you understand?

169
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,078
I understand!

170
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,956
Speaking of live music.

171
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,839
Piano by "Madam Corry", early
20 century, modern.

172
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,432
But that doesn't mean you don't
have to drink up your milk.

173
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,271
And now...

174
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,434
Go to sleep!

175
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,352
Mary Poppins, you won't ever
leave us, will you?

176
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,273
You won't leave us?

177
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,189
Another word from that corner,
and I will call a policeman.

178
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,948
We just wanted to say, we...

179
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,795
... know you will stay with us
for a long time.

180
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,872
I will.

181
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,074
I will stay, until the wind
changes direction.

182
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,874
It is so good!

183
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,873
It is wonderful!

184
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,156
From year to year the weather
changes.

185
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:38,759
Bad weather becomes popular
nowadays. Bad weather!

186
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,397
Water gushes in on us from the
sky as though from a water-pipe.

187
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,916
Bad weather stays on for 6
months, and there's nowhere...

188
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,917
Bad weather stays on for 6
months, and there's nowhere...

189
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:02,234
There's nowhere we can hide,

190
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,353
But we can't delay our life
for later.

191
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,638
There's nowhere we can hide,
but somewhere there...

192
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,116
there's someone in the rain
looking for you!

193
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,193
The fearful peals of thunder
from dusk till dawn...

194
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,036
Bad weather is the atonement
for the people's sins.

195
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,391
Not angina, not common cold.
It is a worse disaster.

196
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,035
Bad weather stays on for 6
months, and there's nowhere...

197
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,878
Bad weather stays on for 6
months, and there's nowhere...

198
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,120
There's nowhere we can hide,

199
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,472
But we can't delay our life
for later.

200
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,508
There's nowhere we can hide,
but somewhere there...

201
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,674
... there's someone in the rain
looking for you!

202
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,351
There's nowhere we can hide,
but somewhere there...

203
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:29,071
... there's someone in the rain
looking for you!

204
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,954
Michael!

205
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,119
Michael!

206
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,997
There's something missing.

207
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,798
I know! There was a piano there.

208
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,233
- Maybe we saw it in our dream?
- And the camp-bed too?

209
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,789
Jane!

210
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,073
Look, the piano!

211
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,394
- Is the camp-bed there?
- It is.

212
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,158
Mary Poppins, it's wonderful
you hadn't left.

213
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,275
We almost thought you were
a dream.

214
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,836
And your camp-bed. Where did
you sleep tonight?

215
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:27,148
Gentlemen never ask ladies
questions like that.

216
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,233
Hey!

217
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,399
Mister Hey, please take my
camp-bed...

218
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,870
... and put it in the nursery.
- Are you talking to me?

219
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,033
Well didn't I say it clearly:
Mister Hey? - I'll do it.

220
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,629
Only my name is Robert
Robertson. - Is that so?

221
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,356
Well can't do anything
about it now.

222
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,432
If I called you Mister Hey once,
you will have to be Mister Hey.

223
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,758
Be careful! I sleep only on this
bed, and on nothing else.

224
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,991
- Good morning, miss Poppins.
- Good morning.

225
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,635
- Nasty weather, isn't it?
- It depends.

226
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,229
At least for those who
save gasoline...

227
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,590
... and ride to the office
on a bicycle.

228
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,996
Mary! I must rush off to the
meeting of the "Women's League".

229
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,069
The children are getting dressed.
Will you feed them please?

230
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,151
Did you think I would let
them starve?

231
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,120
And if you would be so kind as
to make a few purchases...

232
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,358
Maybe. Maybe not.

233
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,194
In any case show me, where I
can find the pram.

234
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,232
You mean, the cart?

235
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,509
My brother is so clumsy, he took
it for a chair and sat on it.

236
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,797
I'm talking about Jane's
and Michael's old pram.

237
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,995
I'm not interested in anything
else. And I happen to know...

238
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,070
... it's in the storeroom.
- Really?

239
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,159
So it is.

240
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,595
But I don't understand,
what for?

241
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,996
Excellent. A most convenient
thing to transport buys!

242
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,039
You may go now.

243
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,995
Hey!

244
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,429
May I ask, why you call me
Mister Hey, Mary Poppins?

245
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,999
Mister Hey! I like that!
Mister Hey!

246
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,476
He starts all his songs with
a "Hey"!

247
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,916
Well of course it's Mister Hey!
How do you do, Mister Hey!

248
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,634
I don't like the way you
speak to your uncle.

249
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,833
Don't forget to turn off the gas
under the big pan,..

250
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,191
Mister Hey.

251
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,668
- Mrs. Lark, I beg you!
- My God! My boy got lost again!

252
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,192
We must call the police
and the fire brigade!

253
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,750
Poor, poor Mrs. Lark.

254
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,435
There he is! Near admiral
Boom's place!

255
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,391
My God, Edward! My little doggy!
Edward!

256
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,637
Oh, no! This horrible shaggy
mongrel again!

257
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,635
Go away! Go away! Edward,
come home this very minute!

258
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,713
To run away all alone, without a
coat! I am very displeased.

259
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,912
You have no heart for me,
Edward! Come home!

260
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,950
He says he is not coming home.

261
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,073
And how do you know what my dog
is saying, may I ask?

262
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,757
He is going home this instant.

263
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,111
He won't go without his friend.

264
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:47,355
How can he even think that I
will let in this shaggy animal?

265
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,356
- He says the issue is closed.
- What?!

266
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:59,191
That - after everything I've
done for you, Edward?

267
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,799
All right, all right, let it be
on your terms. But from now on

268
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,598
... my heart is broken forever.
Forever!

269
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,833
So it's decided.

270
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:20,154
I will name the dog Shaggy
or Boy.

271
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,119
No, his name is Bartholomew.
And no other name will do.

272
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,431
Bartholomew?!

273
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,236
That's all I need.

274
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,911
What else does he say?

275
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,557
He says he will come back
on one condition...

276
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,675
... That you will never make
him wear his coat.

277
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,118
- It's his final word.
- Very well..

278
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,558
But if you catch cold and start
sneezing, It will be your fault!

279
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,031
Do come in!

280
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,552
What a charming lady
moved to our neighborhood.

281
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,992
2 pounds of the best sausages,
and quick. We're in a hurry.

282
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,392
In a hurry? What a pity.

283
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,713
What a pity!

284
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,157
I was hoping you would stay a
while, and we will chat a bit.

285
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,032
How about that?

286
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,553
You know, us butchers like
company.

287
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,636
What is the young lady
doing tonight?

288
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,279
2 pounds, you said? La-la!

289
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,670
The very best I have,
of course!

290
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,917
I'm at your service! I'm at
your service!

291
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,792
Yes! Yes! Since you're
in a hurry,

292
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,236
... then by all means.
For you, of course,

293
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,239
For you, of course,
for you, for you, for you, of course.

294
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,591
For you, of course,
for you, of course.

295
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,355
For you, of course,
for you, of course.

296
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,875
- Turn the record.
- For you, of course...

297
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:33,671
Oh, what nasty weather!

298
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,476
Oh, that Eastern wind!

299
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:45,075
Looks like there will be no
summer,

300
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:54,835
... and I come to think of it,
there wasn't any.

301
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:07,674
I wouldn't say you look very
healthy either.

302
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,673
- And it is not at all...
- Look who's talking.

303
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,430
... surprising!

304
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,515
I heard something...

305
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,316
... from the man in the
butcher's shop.

306
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,270
Who - from the hair-pin to the
safety-pin,

307
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,590
From the hat down to the shoes...

308
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,159
Is sheer elegance?

309
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,190
They're all crazy about me:
a gray-haired gentlemen

310
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,231
And a young boy.

311
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,470
I come out to the crossing

312
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,471
With a nonchalant air,

313
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,834
... and a 100 buses freeze,
and cars start honking:

314
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,789
Salute to beauty!

315
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,111
Lady, what is your name?

316
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,508
- Mary!
- Lady Mary.

317
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,719
- Mary!
- Lady Mary.

318
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,160
You are perfection itself,
You are perfection itself,

319
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,239
From your smile to your step
You're above all praise.

320
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,995
Oh, what a bliss it is,
Oh, what a bliss it is...

321
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,916
To know you're perfection,
To know, you're an ideal!

322
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,989
- Mary!
- Lady Mary.

323
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,238
- Mary!
- Lady Mary.

324
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,913
Mary!

325
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,476
Who cures angina and colds...

326
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,435
Faster than any mixtures?

327
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,591
And who saves all folks better
than any doctors...

328
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,518
In summer and in winter -
Just with her smile.

329
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,351
Children grow up,

330
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,550
But I will never grow old,

331
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,839
And everyone will remember
me and wait for me to come.

332
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,553
Years will go by, but no one
will forget...

333
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,869
- Mary!
- Lady Mary.

334
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,754
- Mary!
- Lady Mary.

335
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,235
You are sheer perfection,
You are sheer perfection,

336
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,394
From your smile to your step
You're above all praise.

337
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,396
Oh, what a bliss it is,
Oh, what a bliss it is...

338
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,269
To know you're perfection,
To know you're an ideal!

339
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,348
- Mary!
-m Lady Mary.

340
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,638
- Mary!
- Lady Mary.

341
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,511
Mary!

342
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,797
I'm switching off the light.

343
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,717
- Do you often do that?
- Do what?

344
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,476
Do you often jump about like
that?

345
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,552
Jump about?! Would you kindly
explain what you mean?

346
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,070
But we saw it just now!

347
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,312
What?!

348
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,950
- You saw me jump about?
- We did.

349
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,638
How dare you!

350
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,355
For your information, young man
I don't jump about, I dance.

351
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,759
I finished a ballet school on
the Island of Tarabar.

352
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,760
And with excellent marks!
Madam Corry's class.

353
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,829
What a strange fantasy!
"Jump about"!

354
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,477
Good morning, boys!

355
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,871
I hope you had a good night's
sleep?

356
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,072
Now for the musical class.

357
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,959
Switch it on.

358
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,238
It's a good thing you finally
agreed, Banks. My sources,

359
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,036
very reliable sources say, they
will be flying in any time now.

360
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,074
I am happy to use your advice,
admiral.

361
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,475
Begin.

362
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,915
Go ahead!

363
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,875
- What's going on here? Stop!
- Stop!

364
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:37,118
Good morning, Mrs. Banks. I am
Bob Gudetti from West-Mole Co.

365
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,594
My assistant.

366
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,675
Over my dead body!

367
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:48,712
On the contrary, we are doing
all in our power to avoid that

368
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,634
... in view of the possible
invasion from outer space.

369
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:57,914
A quarter-de luxe class shelter
with a phone, a toilet and gas!

370
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,949
Food supplies enough to last
8 years!

371
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,868
With frugal rationing,
of course.

372
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,752
- On what money, you fool?
- Safety is more important!

373
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,477
Bravo, Banks. You did the
right thing.

374
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,349
Hey, Boom, is this your
plotting?

375
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,951
I'll show you what's what,
you rioter!

376
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,071
- Militarist!
- Sponger!

377
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,990
Today we shall take a sample
of the soil. Launch it!

378
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,109
Stop!

379
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:50,153
Hey you, foolish scoundrels!
I'll get you underground!

380
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,959
Mister Banks, did you find oil?

381
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,950
I hate to interfere, mister
Banks...

382
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,228
... but I demand that you don't
disrupt our classes.

383
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,195
Are you going to drill an
oil well?

384
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,119
- No, this is different.
- Mind you, mister Banks:

385
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,472
If you drill an oil well
and find oil,

386
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,877
you may join the Organization
of Oil-exporting Countries.

387
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,159
- I'm not afraid of threats!
- What shall we do?

388
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,034
If you ignore considerations
of your family's peace,

389
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,513
... you could at least think
about the environment.

390
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,754
- I'm with you, sister!
- So what do we do then?

391
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,795
- Who has the decisive word?
- You do!

392
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,279
- Drill it here!
- Right here?

393
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,231
- Yes!
- Take that idiot away!

394
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,474
We'll see who wins! What, you
can't do it? Right!

395
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,398
- Good morning.
- Hey!

396
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,716
Oh, it's you, Mary Poppins!

397
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,798
You are just about the only
sensible person in this house.

398
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,478
You don't believe this nonsense
with aliens. Tell them!

399
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,394
I think the earth is cold
today, sir.

400
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,237
So you're in it too!

401
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,873
Hey you! Are you or are you
not with them?

402
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,636
I'm with the children, sir.
And we are going to the park.

403
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,396
I would stand up from the ground
if I were you, mister Hey.

404
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,473
What kind of an example are you
setting to your nephews?

405
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,353
Don't break the rules!
Throw garbage into waist-bins!

406
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,197
- No littering in the park!
- Don't litter with words, sir.

407
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,589
Neley looks so happy today.

408
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,957
And mister Willkins is sitting
on Mary's favorite place.

409
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,954
All right, I will go to the
pavilion.

410
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,158
But mister Willkins, I haven't
finished reading about Bill.

411
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,833
Excuse me.

412
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,391
I beg your pardon, did you say
something?

413
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,519
Of course I did. I wanted to
read it to the end to find out,

414
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,354
... what Astute Bill needed
the master-key for.

415
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,116
Sorry, I can't help you. I
always finish reading at 4...

416
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,397
... to get home in time for tea.

417
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,753
Then maybe you can lend me your
magazine?

418
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,914
Neley, I can tell you
about Bill.

419
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,157
- Really, Jane?
- Yes.

420
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,313
No, I have a coat and boots
on me...

421
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:26,074
... and the young gentleman
must be very cold.

422
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,155
I will give him my magazine.

423
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,237
Don't worry, mister Willkins.

424
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,028
In a week the series about Bill
will be shown on TV.

425
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:39,075
Never! I am categorically
against screen versions!

426
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,598
Thank you, mister Willkins.

427
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,837
So this is what water is like!
Cool and light!

428
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,279
People, you are so lucky that
you can walk on the ground!

429
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,113
It is so wonderful, Jane!

430
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,075
I'd say this is absolutely
revolting.

431
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,196
Good day, Mary Poppins.

432
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,994
Who allowed you to come down
here, may I ask?

433
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,112
No one. My legs jumped down on
their own, Mary Poppins.

434
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,559
Well then they'd better
jump up again.

435
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,591
Shame on you! On an odd date,

436
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,037
... when Saturn is hardly seen,
and the Hound Dogs don't bark?

437
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,473
What did they teach you?

438
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,351
Mary Poppins! Please let him
spend some more time with us.

439
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,073
A little more!

440
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,508
He must feel so lonely standing
there with no one to talk to!

441
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,749
Please, Marry Poppins! Please!

442
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,199
Edward! What's with you? What
a ridiculous show?

443
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,228
Get up from the dirty grass!

444
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,148
It is all your influence! You..!

445
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,752
- Plebeian! Half-bred! Monster!
- Calm down, Mrs. Lark.

446
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,196
Ed! Bartholomew!

447
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,313
Bartholomew!

448
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,439
Bartholomew! Wait, Bartholomew!

449
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,755
- Bartholomew!
- Come here!

450
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,559
Bartholomew!

451
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,914
We came out for a walk before
tea. It's such a lovely day!

452
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,117
And the dogs insisted.

453
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,871
My God, what am I seeing?

454
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:26,036
You heartless mean little boy!
Why torture the poor fish?

455
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,070
Put it back where you caught it
this instant!

456
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,072
I'm afraid It is quite
impossible.

457
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,997
It's too far away.

458
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:41,870
That doesn't matter. You can't
torture helpless creatures!

459
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,198
I'm going to tell this to the
constable!

460
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,838
Bartholomew, what odd jumps?

461
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,597
- What a scandalous dog!
- You are impossible!

462
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,674
What is he saying?

463
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,672
He says, he won't take that.

464
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,476
He insists that you speak with
him in a polite tone.

465
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,875
I'm going to complain to
the Prime-minister.

466
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,909
Neley, you have 10 minutes.

467
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,833
And then?

468
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,959
Beautiful.

469
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,591
It is live music, isn't it,
Mary Poppins?

470
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,957
Miss Jane, I don't know if
there will be...

471
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,669
... another beautiful day
like today in my life,

472
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,753
but I know for sure, I will
never forgive myself...

473
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,435
if now I don't have the courage
to ask you to a waltz.

474
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,119
I will be honored.

475
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,551
Michael, I ask you as a friend:
please hold my dolphin.

476
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,074
Thank you.

477
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,475
Jane, I don't know how
to dance waltz.

478
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,029
Then why did you ask me?

479
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,152
Well then, let's just walk
a little.

480
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,192
Thank you so much.

481
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,073
- How do you know Mary Poppins?
- She's a friend of my father's.

482
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,755
Who is your father?
Where does he live?

483
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:52,316
He stands on a cliff over the
sea with a trident and a horn...

484
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:56,117
and my mother sits next to him
and brushes her hair.

485
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,028
And the seagulls circle
above them,

486
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,153
and cast winged shadows on their
marble bodies.

487
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,156
How beautiful! By why did
you leave them?

488
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:10,069
I didn't want to. But what can
statues do against people?

489
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,029
How did you get to our
garden?

490
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,709
In a box. We always travel
like that.

491
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,517
They need us in parks,
museums and gardens.

492
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,115
And they buy us and send
us in parcels.

493
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,634
And it doesn't occur to anyone
that we may be lonely.

494
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,710
I love you, Neley.

495
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,430
I want you to stay with
us forever.

496
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,798
I love you too.

497
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,758
But it's impossible, I have to
get back to where I belong.

498
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,788
I understand.

499
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,279
Hey, Mary. How are you feeling?
Hope your back doesn't ache?

500
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,110
Any news?

501
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,993
I'm terribly hungry. Is there
anything yummy...

502
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,074
... for an old friend.

503
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,515
- I didn't hear "thank you".
- Come on, girl!

504
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,276
No time for such ceremonies.
I had meetings all day...

505
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,997
... consultations, negotiations,
discussions.

506
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,631
A lot to decide, a lot to see.

507
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,274
Will you be quiet? Stop
jabbering like a common sparrow.

508
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,272
- You came from there?
- A I have an urgent message.

509
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:23,189
There are two impossible spoilt
twins in New Zealand.

510
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,871
- When?
- The wind changes at midnight.

511
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,116
Well, I have to be off, my girl.
See you soon.

512
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,036
See you soon, old chatterbox.

513
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,552
The wind will change
at midnight!

514
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,111
Wonderful! Isn't it strange...

515
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,709
... that people don't fly.

516
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,031
I had nothing to do with it,
constable.

517
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,235
I never touched it,
I didn't even come near it!

518
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,876
Nonsense, Smith! The statues
are your responsibility.

519
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,596
And no one else could have
done that.

520
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,793
I never had any luck, since
I was a little boy!

521
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,994
- Listen, constable...
- We are wasting our time!

522
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,549
First I have to look for a
naked boy who mistreats a fish!

523
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,150
Was it a cod?.. What did
Mrs. Lark say?

524
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,958
- A mackerel.
- All the more!

525
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:19,590
Now they tell me they're missing
their most valuable statue!

526
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,436
You disappointed me.

527
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,388
I relied on you, and you...

528
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,149
This is how you pay me
for my trust in you!

529
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,638
Good gracious!

530
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,956
Smith, why didn't you tell
me in the first place?

531
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,036
A brilliant idea! Now you don't
have to pretend any more!

532
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,716
Ladies and gentlemen, I was
unfair to the poor fellow.

533
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:53,392
He proved he was not only a
watchman, but an artist as well.

534
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:58,709
He furnished the statue with
a marble book. Excellent!

535
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,710
It is our duty to encourage the
urge of the young to knowledge.

536
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,073
What about the fish?

537
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:10,036
You can get rid of it.

538
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,513
Don't be sour, darling.

539
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:36,074
When we decided to get married,
you told me:

540
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,315
I want either a life of plenty,
or two charming kids.

541
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,397
And you agreed.

542
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,509
Well, now we have both
- a good house and two kids.

543
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:53,428
What else do you need? What is
it you're chasing after?

544
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,509
Everyone is chasing after
something.

545
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,511
That's what life is all about,
isn't it?

546
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,519
Maybe it's just that everyone
lives wrong?

547
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:08,151
Everyone can't live wrong.
And we're not any different.

548
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,598
Besides, that is child's talk.

549
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,672
Look at Mary Poppins. She's
always calm and cool.

550
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,028
If she weren't our nanny I'd say
she was perfection herself.

551
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,068
And receiving such a small
salary at that.

552
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,559
I wonder.

553
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,278
What?

554
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:56,554
I wonder if all this would have
happened, if you weren't here?

555
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,553
And I wonder,

556
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:09,669
when you stop being interested
in what is none of your concern.

557
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,558
Go to bed now!

558
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,558
I wonder, who I am?

559
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,355
What kind of a question is that?
You are Jane Banks.

560
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,438
And I am Michael Banks.

561
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,473
Is that so, Mary Poppins?

562
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,470
Maybe. How should I know? I'm
not the inquiry office.

563
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,069
Your weapon!

564
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,399
Get under the covers, quick!

565
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,554
What did I say to make her
angry again?

566
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,196
Mind you, sir...

567
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:04,153
I never get angry. I have
royal patience.

568
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:08,078
Only you can't shoot at people
from around the corner.

569
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:17,674
And I am so kind today! What
a pity this day had to end.

570
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,759
- Everything ends sometime.
- Except you.

571
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,918
You won't leave us, will you?

572
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:31,593
lmagine what a life I will have
if I spend it all on you.

573
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:39,951
I wonder if mom and dad would
believe us if we told them?

574
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,316
- Told them what?
- Everything.

575
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,639
About Neley, and about Edward,
and Bartholomew.

576
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:51,398
Only they wouldn't believe us.
And they will never know.

577
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,908
- There was a time when
they knew. - Really?!

578
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,315
You're saying, they knew
everything too?

579
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,994
That Neley is alive, and that
you can fly,

580
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,515
... and understand what dogs
are saying?

581
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:07,350
Yes, they knew all that and the
language of birds and animals.

582
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,035
In the past.

583
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,392
- Then why did they forget it?
- Because they grew up.

584
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,032
That's sad.

585
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,518
None the less, it is true.

586
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,073
I'm turning off the light.

587
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:27,632
You are a grown-up too, but you
know it, you haven't forgotten.

588
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,989
Me? I'm not like everyone else.

589
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,991
I m a rare exception. I am
beyond comparison.

590
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:42,071
I am "Lady Perfection".

591
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:51,998
All right, a few more minutes,
as an exception.

592
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:00,031
But on one condition: you will
go to sleep...

593
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,311
... and you will have sweet
dreams.

594
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:18,275
All that happened many
years ago...

595
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:25,189
Is stored in our colorful
dreams,

596
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:34,671
And the magic ring-dance
of those dreams...

597
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:40,039
Takes grown-ups back into their
childhood.

598
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,392
Dreams, where fairy-tales live
amidst wonders,

599
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:51,156
Dreams, where you can reach out
and touch the stars,

600
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,916
He, who is a little in his
childhood, is a happy man.

601
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,633
Our childhood is long gone,

602
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,278
the ABC book of our past life
is read to the last page.

603
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,915
Summer, autumn, winter...

604
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,949
Summer, autumn, winter,
And no spring!

605
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,072
But the warmth of that spring,

606
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,712
But the warmth of that spring...

607
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:21,318
Is cherished in our childish
dreams.

608
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:27,669
The wonderful country of our
childish dreams...

609
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,475
Everyone needs them when
they grow old.

610
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:44,309
Only it's sad that when we
grow old...

611
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:49,515
We don't often see those colorful
dreams.

612
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,872
Dreams, where fairy-tales live
amidst wonders,

613
00:53:54,760 --> 00:54:00,551
Dreams, where you can reach out
and touch the stars,

614
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,071
He, who is a little in his
childhood, is a happy man.

615
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,719
Our childhood is long gone,

616
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,360
the ABC book of our past life
is read to the last page.

617
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,117
Summer, autumn, winter...

618
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,990
Summer, autumn, winter,
And no spring!

619
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:23,558
But the warmth of that spring,

620
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:27,232
But the warmth of that spring...

621
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,559
Is cherished in our childish
dreams.

622
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,196
Our childish dreams,

623
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:37,274
Our childish dreams,

624
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,392
Our childish dreams.

625
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,439
Good evening, Mary Poppins. That
was beautiful singing.

626
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,434
Me?!

627
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,274
I suggest that you wouldn't
forget, I am a decent girl...

628
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,595
and I sing only in the morning!
- Then I must have dreamt it.

629
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:30,515
I've been wanting to talk to you
all this time, Mary Poppins.

630
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,269
- You're not in a hurry now?
- Indeed I am!

631
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,674
- But it depends on the wind.
- The wind? It is getting cold.

632
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,833
I think it is time that you
moved inside, mister Hey.

633
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,232
Autumn is nearing, tents
catch fire.

634
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:50,592
I see. So you too think I'm a
useless idler.

635
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:56,233
On the contrary. I like you,
mister Hey.

636
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,915
You like live music too,
don't you?

637
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:02,437
- Live music?
- The one you don't turn on.

638
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,834
Oh yes, I see.

639
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,594
However some of your songs
are... how should I put it?

640
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,599
But I hate to see how some folks
live on Cherry Street,

641
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,831
... and I tell about it in
my songs.

642
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,469
Did it ever occur to you,
mister Hey,..

643
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,353
that at times people come to
understand it themselves?

644
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,471
Yes. But what should I do then?

645
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,194
Maybe, It's time I started
doing something indeed?

646
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:29,159
I have to go too!

647
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:34,158
Good bye, and don't forget what
I said about your nephews.

648
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:52,234
Do something! Do something!

649
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:57,034
Do something! That's it!
Why didn't it ever occur to me?

650
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:01,599
You are damn right, Mary!
Only how do you do it?

651
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,231
It's a pity you won't see how I
get into this car...

652
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:10,393
... and dump it in the nearest
ditch, the damned gravedigger!

653
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,794
No, that's not it.

654
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,191
Only he who acts,
accomplishes things!

655
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,553
No, that's not it again.

656
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,430
What a pity you won't see this,
Mary. I think I won't either.

657
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,314
Have they come?

658
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:18,116
They're here! Pipe all hands
off deck!

659
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,758
Full submersion!

660
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,595
Full submersion! They're here!

661
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:27,559
They've come, my beauties!
God damn my spleen!

662
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:46,195
Post 107 reporting a fire at 17,
On Cherry St.! On the double!

663
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,950
I knew it from the beginning,
just like Astute Bill!

664
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,748
Post 107 reporting. There's a
fire at 17, Cherry Street!

665
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:57,073
Mister Banks found an oil
deposit! Batten down the hatch!

666
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,071
Calm down, the fire brigade
is on it's way.

667
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,555
Do you have buckets, hooks,
fire-extinguishers?

668
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:07,638
Congratulations, mister Banks!
What luck!

669
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,478
It isn't oil, it's gas.

670
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,438
- Gas?
- Gas?!

671
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:17,156
That's not so bad, mister Banks.
Gas is even better than oil.

672
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:21,390
It happens that you go to pick
berries and find a mushroom.

673
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,837
The mushroom - that is gas - is
much better than oil.

674
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:28,715
You stretch a gas pipeline
across my courtyard...

675
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:35,833
and join the Organization of
Gas-exporting Countries.

676
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:39,358
Darling, did I get lucky
at last?

677
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,878
Quiet! Quiet! If they ask,
I was with you.

678
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,599
What is that? A thunderstorm?

679
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,235
- Oh, no. A little fire.
- Hurray!

680
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:12,150
Quiet, children! We were
playing "hit-ship".

681
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,597
Hurray! Jane, look, our house
is on fire! Hurray!

682
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,115
- Where is Mary Poppins?
- Jane, look...

683
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:24,119
And where's the piano by "Madam
Corry"? And the camp-bed?

684
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:29,309
The wind! The wind has changed!

685
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,673
That means.. that means,
she's gone?

686
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:39,160
She said she would stay until
the wind changed direction.

687
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:43,000
Thank God you're here!

688
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:46,429
We were playing "hit-ship".

689
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,395
- Mother, she's gone!
- Who?

690
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:53,036
Mother, Mary Poppins left us.

691
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:57,873
To leave at such a crucial
moment? How selfish of her!

692
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:02,149
I will never accept the
heartless girl back. Never!

693
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,908
- Mother!
- You are so wicked!

694
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:09,508
Shame on you, children.

695
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:13,908
I want Mary Poppins, and no
one else in the whole world!

696
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,872
Where is the fire hydrant?

697
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,793
My God, well it isn't in the
nursery!

698
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,399
Look!

699
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,034
Oh!

700
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:37,069
It's her. It's her portrait.

701
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:43,713
There's something written there.
It's "Au revoir, Mary Poppins".

702
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,435
- Au revo...
- Hey, what's "Au revoir"?

703
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,274
I think it's in French and I
think it's "Farewell".

704
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,388
No!

705
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,674
It's "good-bye". I'm sure.
It's "good-bye"!

706
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,275
- Then it's all right?
- She will come back!

707
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,915
She always keeps her promise!

708
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,317
- Oh, mister Banks.
- Yes?

709
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,592
There's an urgent telegram
for you.

710
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:16,469
Here.

711
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,191
Must be congratulations?
So soon?

712
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,639
- Any answer?
- No.

713
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,192
- What about the tip?
- Forget about it!

714
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,557
What a detestable manner...

715
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:34,110
... to bring bad news on
such a happy day?

716
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,439
Yes...

717
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:02,150
They haven't come.
I sound off retreat!

718
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:05,313
