1
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:05,962
<i>On yonder rock reclining</i>

2
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:10,126
<i>That fierce and swarthy form behold</i>

3
00:02:10,293 --> 00:02:13,888
<i>Fast his hand his carbine hold</i>

4
00:02:14,053 --> 00:02:17,204
<i>'Tis his best friend of old</i>

5
00:02:17,373 --> 00:02:20,809
<i>This way his steps inclining</i>

6
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:24,886
<i>His scarlet plume waves o 'er his brow</i>

7
00:02:25,053 --> 00:02:28,329
<i>And his velvet cloak hangs low</i>

8
00:02:28,493 --> 00:02:31,929
<i>Playing in careless flow</i>

9
00:02:32,093 --> 00:02:34,846
<i>Tremble!</i>

10
00:02:35,693 --> 00:02:39,208
<i>E'en while the storm is beating</i>

11
00:02:39,373 --> 00:02:43,161
<i>Afar hear echo repeating</i>

12
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:46,166
<i>Diavolo, Diavolo, Diavolo!</i>

13
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,882
<i>Tremble!</i>

14
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:53,489
<i>E'en while the storm is beating</i>

15
00:02:53,653 --> 00:02:57,168
<i>Afar hear echo repeating</i>

16
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,803
<i>Diavolo, Diavolo, Diavolo!</i>

17
00:03:06,213 --> 00:03:08,681
Well, dark eyes,
who's your last lover, huh?

18
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:10,730
What success, Diavolo?

19
00:03:10,893 --> 00:03:13,453
Great success with the prettiest wench
in all Christendom.

20
00:03:13,613 --> 00:03:15,888
The devil with wenches.

21
00:03:16,053 --> 00:03:17,884
Did you get a goose for us to pick?

22
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:19,691
''Goose'' is the very word.

23
00:03:19,853 --> 00:03:23,289
A skinny old lord
who simply stinks with gold. . .

24
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,603
. . .and his pretty wife. . .

25
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:29,966
. . .whose jewels sparkle like
an early frost on a December morning.

26
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:32,601
-Did you steal them?
-Of course not.

27
00:03:32,773 --> 00:03:35,446
She knew me only
as the Marquis de San Marco. . .

28
00:03:35,613 --> 00:03:39,526
. . .and as such, l could only sing her
a song and steal her heart.

29
00:03:39,973 --> 00:03:44,171
And there was l, sitting
in the very same coach with them.

30
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,370
His Lordship,
that was her husband, sitting here. . .

31
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:51,731
. . .Her Ladyship, and what a ladyship,
sitting there.

32
00:03:51,893 --> 00:03:56,171
And here was l, dressed as the marquis,
and what a marquis.

33
00:03:56,333 --> 00:04:00,167
<i>The gondolier</i>

34
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:05,532
<i>Fond passion 's slave</i>

35
00:04:05,693 --> 00:04:09,447
<i>Will for his love</i>

36
00:04:09,613 --> 00:04:15,006
<i>Each danger brave</i>

37
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:19,689
<i>Winds and waves</i>

38
00:04:19,853 --> 00:04:24,005
<i>Both disdained</i>

39
00:04:24,173 --> 00:04:28,769
<i>From his fair one's bright eyes</i>

40
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:34,724
<i>Be a glance but his prize</i>

41
00:04:34,893 --> 00:04:40,251
<i>It is still something</i>

42
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:44,804
<i>Something gained</i>

43
00:04:44,973 --> 00:04:49,091
<i>It is still</i>

44
00:04:49,253 --> 00:04:53,371
<i>It is still</i>

45
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:58,732
<i>It is still something gained</i>

46
00:04:58,893 --> 00:05:03,011
<i>It is still</i>

47
00:05:03,173 --> 00:05:07,883
<i>It is still</i>

48
00:05:08,053 --> 00:05:14,128
<i>It is still something gained</i>

49
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:23,053
Lovely lady, this pearl grows yellow
against the marble of your hand.

50
00:05:23,613 --> 00:05:28,243
Well, yellow or not,
it cost my husband 50,000 francs.

51
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:29,971
No.

52
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:34,328
And this medallion cost him 1 00,000.

53
00:05:34,493 --> 00:05:37,485
One hundred thousand francs.

54
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:40,811
-What a waste of money.
-Sir?

55
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:44,966
When even diamonds grow dull
beneath the sparkle of your eyes.

56
00:05:45,453 --> 00:05:46,886
Oh, milord.

57
00:05:47,053 --> 00:05:52,173
But isn't your husband afraid to let his
pretty wife travel with all these jewels?

58
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:56,167
-Oh, why, this isn't the half of them.
-No?

59
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:59,086
-Just wait till you see.
-What?

60
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:05,130
l'll wager this is the richest fruitcake
you've ever seen.

61
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:07,973
Too rich, milady, too rich.

62
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:10,772
Why, this road is overrun
with the worst bandits in ltaly.

63
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:14,164
Oh, they'll never find my jewels.

64
00:06:14,693 --> 00:06:19,323
Nor my husband's 500,000 francs.

65
00:06:21,693 --> 00:06:24,924
Francs? Francs?
Who said 500,000 francs?

66
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:29,243
l was just saying, my love,
that you're far too clever. . .

67
00:06:29,413 --> 00:06:31,802
. . .for those nasty, nasty bandits.

68
00:06:31,973 --> 00:06:36,330
l wish l were as clever with popinjays.

69
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:43,803
And that's how l found milady's jewels.

70
00:06:44,693 --> 00:06:47,924
As a marquis, l uphold tradition.

71
00:06:48,093 --> 00:06:49,367
You hold up the coach.

72
00:06:50,693 --> 00:06:53,446
Tonio, Alessandro, come with me.
l want a word with you.

73
00:06:54,573 --> 00:06:58,566
<i>Drink, for joy bestowing</i>
<i>Around, around, the wine is flowing</i>

74
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:02,328
<i>Wine's the soldier's shield</i>
<i>In the tented field</i>

75
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:05,806
<i>Wine's the soldier's shield</i>
<i>In the tented field</i>

76
00:07:05,973 --> 00:07:08,203
ls there anything l can do
to help you, Father, dear?

77
00:07:08,373 --> 00:07:13,652
Yes, there is. Stay away from
that poverty-stricken young soldier. . .

78
00:07:13,813 --> 00:07:17,362
. . .or all the plans l have made for you
will be spoiled.

79
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:22,004
But, Father, l love Lorenzo,
and l'm not afraid of poverty.

80
00:07:22,453 --> 00:07:23,681
But l am.

81
00:07:23,853 --> 00:07:26,970
But, Father, perhaps Lorenzo
and l could save enough--

82
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,932
You'll marry Francesco tomorrow.

83
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:32,849
-But, Father--
-Not another word.

84
00:07:33,013 --> 00:07:36,050
<i>Glory's path while bravely pursuing</i>

85
00:07:36,213 --> 00:07:41,082
<i>Love and wine his toils repay</i>

86
00:07:41,613 --> 00:07:44,844
Don't weep, dear.
What did your father have to say?

87
00:07:45,013 --> 00:07:48,926
-l've got to marry Francesco.
-You don't have to marry anyone.

88
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:52,130
-Why don't you just flatly refuse.
-You don't understand.

89
00:07:52,293 --> 00:07:54,409
lt isn't that simple.

90
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:59,044
Father hasn't a lira,
and he's going to lose the inn.

91
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:03,008
Oh, if l could only capture Diavolo.

92
00:08:03,173 --> 00:08:08,167
But, darling, you've been on his trail
for months, and he always slips away.

93
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,325
Yes, but each time
l've been a little closer.

94
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:15,528
And one of these days
he'll not slip away.

95
00:09:10,653 --> 00:09:13,850
-Come on.
-Well, he won't go.

96
00:09:14,013 --> 00:09:16,971
Well, don't sit there dreaming.
Do something.

97
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:20,045
Well, what can l do?
He won't pay any attention to me.

98
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:23,485
Why don't you give him a couple of:

99
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:28,884
-l don't want to do that yet.
-Why?

100
00:09:29,373 --> 00:09:32,285
l'm saving it for the hills.

101
00:09:34,813 --> 00:09:36,451
Come on.

102
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,931
''Saving it for the hills. ''

103
00:09:54,373 --> 00:09:56,091
Just a moment.

104
00:09:57,173 --> 00:10:01,052
-What'd you do with our money?
-l got it in the saddlebag.

105
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:04,762
You'd better give it to me.
lt'll be safer in my hands.

106
00:10:10,413 --> 00:10:12,688
Our life savings.

107
00:10:13,173 --> 00:10:16,085
Wouldn't it be terrible
if we lost this?

108
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:20,930
After all the years
we have toiled and slaved for it?

109
00:10:21,093 --> 00:10:24,449
Why, we've even gone
without the necessities of life. . .

110
00:10:24,613 --> 00:10:30,324
. . .deprived ourselves of food,
actually starved.

111
00:10:30,773 --> 00:10:33,731
But now we have our reward.

112
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:38,968
We can settle down for life
and live on the fat of the land.

113
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:41,931
Keep your hands where they are.

114
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:54,127
Hand it over.

115
00:11:05,093 --> 00:11:07,129
There it goes.

116
00:11:07,813 --> 00:11:10,850
After all we went through to get it.

117
00:11:11,413 --> 00:11:16,282
Oh, well. Come easy, go easy,
that's my motto.

118
00:11:16,493 --> 00:11:20,168
What do you mean,
''come easy, go easy''?

119
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:25,487
Now we've got to start all over again,
right at the bottom.

120
00:11:26,573 --> 00:11:29,133
Why don't we start at the top?

121
00:11:29,493 --> 00:11:33,088
-What do you mean?
-Well, why don't we become bandits?

122
00:11:33,253 --> 00:11:36,290
Then we wouldn't
have to work hard anymore.

123
00:11:36,813 --> 00:11:39,691
Let's get it the easy way.

124
00:11:39,853 --> 00:11:43,368
We could rob the rich and give them
to the poor, and we could have all--

125
00:11:43,533 --> 00:11:47,845
That's the first time
that you've shown any intelligence.

126
00:11:48,013 --> 00:11:50,573
Well, it's the first time
you've listened to me.

127
00:11:50,733 --> 00:11:54,567
You know, if you'd listen to me once
in a while, you'd be a lot better off.

128
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:57,088
l guess you're right.

129
00:11:57,693 --> 00:12:00,332
Tell me that plan again.

130
00:12:02,693 --> 00:12:05,765
-All of it?
-Certainly, certainly.

131
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:10,245
Well, if-- lf we became rich and--

132
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:14,167
And we robbed the poor and
we gave them to the bandits. . .

133
00:12:14,653 --> 00:12:17,213
. . .and we could start at the top. . .

134
00:12:17,373 --> 00:12:20,570
. . .and we'd get to the bottom
without working hard anymore.

135
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:24,931
We can't go wrong.
lt's the law of conversation.

136
00:12:25,093 --> 00:12:26,526
What do you mean?

137
00:12:26,693 --> 00:12:32,131
Well, as ye cast your bread
on the waters, so shall ye reap.

138
00:12:32,413 --> 00:12:37,282
-That's very well thought out.
-l'm glad you agree.

139
00:12:37,493 --> 00:12:40,371
You know, there's one thing
that's bothering me, though.

140
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:41,966
What's that?

141
00:12:42,133 --> 00:12:44,522
We don't know anything
about being bandits.

142
00:12:44,693 --> 00:12:47,446
-l never--
-Why, it's simple.

143
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,769
We can be bandits.

144
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:52,925
lt doesn't require any brains.

145
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:55,691
Come on.

146
00:13:33,453 --> 00:13:35,045
Your money or your life.

147
00:13:38,053 --> 00:13:40,203
Your money or your life.

148
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,842
Your money or your life.

149
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:46,291
What?

150
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:50,561
Your money or your life.

151
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,767
We're a couple of bandits.

152
00:13:54,933 --> 00:13:57,891
We've come to take your money.

153
00:14:00,213 --> 00:14:03,649
You wouldn't rob me.

154
00:14:03,813 --> 00:14:06,930
l can't afford to give you any money.

155
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:13,088
l'm a poor, hard-working old man.

156
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:18,247
The father of 1 6 children.

157
00:14:19,213 --> 00:14:21,443
lt takes all l can earn. . .

158
00:14:21,613 --> 00:14:27,688
. . .to put bread in their
poor little hungry mouths.

159
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:30,410
l've got a sick wife. . .

160
00:14:30,573 --> 00:14:34,691
. . .and Grandma don't feel so well either.

161
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:39,768
Look at me. Look at me.

162
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:43,846
l got one foot in the grave.

163
00:14:45,773 --> 00:14:47,729
You wouldn't rob me. . .

164
00:14:47,893 --> 00:14:51,044
. . .and see my little ones go without.

165
00:14:51,853 --> 00:14:54,128
Would you?

166
00:15:24,253 --> 00:15:27,484
Oh, thank you, sir.

167
00:15:52,373 --> 00:15:54,045
From now on, l'll do the robbing.

168
00:15:54,213 --> 00:15:56,807
<i>On yonder rock reclining</i>

169
00:15:56,973 --> 00:16:00,761

00:16:06,413 --> 00:16:08,529
-Diavolo.
-Come on, boys. Run for your lives.

173
00:16:12,053 --> 00:16:13,532
Run. Diavolo.

174
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:15,850
-Run for your lives.
-Come on.

175
00:16:16,013 --> 00:16:18,527
-Diavolo.
-Diavolo!

176
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:22,371
-Run for your lives! Run for your lives!
-Run for your lives.

177
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:24,967
<i>Tremble!</i>

178
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:28,648
-lt's Diavolo.
-Diavolo! Run for your lives!

179
00:16:28,813 --> 00:16:30,883
Come on, hide.

180
00:16:50,773 --> 00:16:52,365
What's going on here?

181
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:55,163
That was Fra Diavolo.

182
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:59,645
He's a bloodthirsty villain
and the terror of the countryside.

183
00:17:00,213 --> 00:17:05,685
lf you ever cross his path,
he'll cut your throat from ear to ear.

184
00:17:05,853 --> 00:17:09,243
Have a care. Have a care.

185
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:16,605
Maybe we'd better not be bandits.

186
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:21,012
Tut, tut, tut.

187
00:17:21,453 --> 00:17:25,128
Do you think that l'm perturbed
by his idle twaddle?

188
00:17:25,293 --> 00:17:27,761
-Well, he said, ''Have a care. ''
-Come on.

189
00:17:27,933 --> 00:17:30,970
But suppose we meet this Diavolo.

190
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:36,571
All we have to do
is to watch our p's and q's.

191
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:40,442
Don't you think that l know a bandit
when l see one?

192
00:17:40,613 --> 00:17:43,173
Well, l don't wanna walk around
with my throat cut.

193
00:17:59,893 --> 00:18:03,044
<i>My lord and lady have been robbed</i>
<i>My lord and lady have been robbed</i>

194
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:09,411
<i>-My lord and lady have been robbed</i>
<i>-My lord and lady have been robbed</i>

195
00:18:12,813 --> 00:18:16,408
<i>My lord and lady have been robbed</i>
<i>My lord and lady have been robbed</i>

196
00:18:18,853 --> 00:18:21,128
Find out which way the coach came,
then assemble the troops.

197
00:18:21,293 --> 00:18:23,170
<i>My lord and lady have been robbed</i>

198
00:18:25,733 --> 00:18:27,769
-What are you going to do?
-Don't you see, dear?

199
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:30,652
This must be the work of Diavolo.
lt's our one big chance.

200
00:18:30,813 --> 00:18:34,442
-Do be careful.
-Careful.

201
00:19:15,253 --> 00:19:19,565
l'll take charge of this one.
You've gotten us into enough trouble.

202
00:19:23,213 --> 00:19:25,204
Stand and deliver.

203
00:19:26,693 --> 00:19:28,684
Deliver to whom?

204
00:19:28,853 --> 00:19:32,050
Tell him who you are, that'll scare him.

205
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,932
l am Diavolo.

206
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:38,809
Yeah, and if you're not careful,
he'll cut your throat from here to there.

207
00:19:38,973 --> 00:19:43,091
All over the countryside.
You better watch your q's and p's.

208
00:19:43,253 --> 00:19:46,928
So you are Fra Diavolo?

209
00:19:47,093 --> 00:19:51,848
'Tis true you've never seen my face,
but you've heard my voice.

210
00:19:52,293 --> 00:19:57,128
<i>On yonder rock reclining</i>

211
00:19:57,293 --> 00:20:00,683
<i>Diavolo....</i>

212
00:20:04,013 --> 00:20:08,768
<i>On yonder rock reclining--</i>

213
00:20:08,933 --> 00:20:12,812
<i>Diavolo the bandit stands</i>

214
00:20:12,973 --> 00:20:16,249
<i>In his hand his carbine hold</i>

215
00:20:16,413 --> 00:20:19,371
<i>'Tis his best friend of old</i>

216
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:22,730
<i>Tremble!</i>

217
00:20:22,893 --> 00:20:25,930
<i>E'en while the storm is beating</i>

218
00:20:26,093 --> 00:20:29,802
<i>A while hear echo repeating</i>

219
00:20:29,973 --> 00:20:33,568
<i>Diavolo, Diavolo, Diavolo</i>

220
00:20:42,413 --> 00:20:48,010
Gentleman, allow me to introduce you
to our rival competitors.

221
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:52,126
lf you hadn't arrived in the nick of time,
Diavolo would have been no more.

222
00:20:52,853 --> 00:20:56,163
With such ruffian as these
in our midst. . .

223
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,847
. . .everybody's life's in danger.

224
00:20:59,013 --> 00:21:01,811
-Well, what shall we do with them, boys?
-Hang them!

225
00:21:01,973 --> 00:21:05,124
Hanging it shall be.
Throw a rope over that tree.

226
00:21:06,693 --> 00:21:08,649
Please, sir, spare our lives.

227
00:21:08,813 --> 00:21:12,123
First you steal my name,
and then you hold me up.

228
00:21:12,293 --> 00:21:16,047
-Hanging's too good for you.
-Oh, please, give us another chance.

229
00:21:16,213 --> 00:21:20,286
We didn't mean to hold you up.
We were just coming around. . . .

230
00:21:25,093 --> 00:21:29,928
All right, all right.
l'll give you another chance.

231
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:32,203
Can we go now?

232
00:21:32,973 --> 00:21:36,170
You shall be the executioner. . .

233
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:40,326
. . .and hang that overfed windbag.

234
00:21:41,693 --> 00:21:46,084
And if you make a good job of it,
you can go free.

235
00:21:46,853 --> 00:21:48,844
-Well, boys, did you hold up the coach?
-Yeah.

236
00:21:49,013 --> 00:21:50,969
Well, let's see what you got.

237
00:21:53,173 --> 00:21:57,325
And if he's not strung up
by the time l'm through:

238
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:09,772
-Well, let's see what you've got.
-Aye.

239
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:14,089
A king's ransom there, boys.

240
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,563
Don't hurt him, mister.

241
00:22:23,453 --> 00:22:26,968
Hold on.
Chief said he had to do that.

242
00:22:27,693 --> 00:22:29,285
Here you are.

243
00:22:30,093 --> 00:22:31,970
Good luck, boys.

244
00:23:04,853 --> 00:23:08,323
-Well, where's the money?
-Money? We found no money.

245
00:23:09,253 --> 00:23:12,962
-You--? You found no money?
-No.

246
00:23:13,133 --> 00:23:15,044
Do you know what was in that coach?

247
00:23:15,213 --> 00:23:17,443
Five hundred thousand francs,
and you had to miss it.

248
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:20,730
-Five hundred thousand francs?
-Five hundred thousand francs.

249
00:23:20,893 --> 00:23:22,884
Dolts. Fools. ldiots. Louts.

250
00:23:23,053 --> 00:23:25,089
After all my work,
you've botched up everything.

251
00:23:25,253 --> 00:23:27,323
For that, there won't be any split.

252
00:23:27,733 --> 00:23:30,406
Can't we at least share the jewels?

253
00:23:32,413 --> 00:23:35,166
That means l shall have to follow
the coach to the inn.

254
00:23:36,293 --> 00:23:38,204
None of us can follow that coach, chief.

255
00:23:38,373 --> 00:23:39,931
-Why not?
-We'd all be recognized.

256
00:23:40,093 --> 00:23:41,731
-Yeah.
-That's right.

257
00:23:48,613 --> 00:23:50,649
There, that's better.

258
00:23:53,773 --> 00:23:55,650
You're choking me.

259
00:23:55,813 --> 00:23:57,610
l'm sorry.

260
00:23:59,213 --> 00:24:01,329
Just be careful.

261
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:11,206
-Goodbye, Ollio.
-Goodbye.

262
00:24:12,813 --> 00:24:18,285
You know, l hate to have to do this,
but you heard what he said.

263
00:24:18,693 --> 00:24:21,366
Please help me make a good job of it.

264
00:24:21,533 --> 00:24:23,603
l'll do my best.

265
00:24:23,773 --> 00:24:27,368
You know, this is going to hurt you
more than it does me.

266
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:29,125
Put yourself in my place.

267
00:24:29,293 --> 00:24:33,844
l wish l could.
l know just how you feel.

268
00:24:34,213 --> 00:24:37,125
-Goodbye, Ollio.
-Goodbye.

269
00:24:40,013 --> 00:24:42,846
-Ollio?
-What?

270
00:24:43,013 --> 00:24:46,847
Before you go,
l have a little confession to make.

271
00:24:48,093 --> 00:24:52,132
You remember that girl that
you were very much in love with and--

272
00:24:52,293 --> 00:24:54,602
And you wanted to marry her. . .

273
00:24:54,773 --> 00:24:59,893
. . .and she wouldn't marry you
because she heard you had a son?

274
00:25:00,813 --> 00:25:03,327
Well, l was to blame for that.

275
00:25:04,413 --> 00:25:07,325
l told her l was your son.

276
00:25:13,773 --> 00:25:15,126
Do you forgive me?

277
00:25:18,653 --> 00:25:21,725
-Goodbye, Ollie.
-Goodbye.

278
00:25:25,813 --> 00:25:28,168
-Ollio?
-What?

279
00:25:30,413 --> 00:25:34,565
Before you go, there's just
one more thing l want to ask you.

280
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,086
What?

281
00:25:36,253 --> 00:25:38,084
After you're gone. . .

282
00:25:38,253 --> 00:25:42,451
. . .do you want to be buried,
or shall l have you stuffed?

283
00:25:43,213 --> 00:25:45,773
Why, l think that l'd rather--

284
00:25:45,973 --> 00:25:47,884
What do you mean, stuffed?

285
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:52,447
Well, l thought it'd be nice
to keep you in the living room.

286
00:25:54,133 --> 00:25:57,808
Now, wouldn't l look silly
standing on a pedestal.

287
00:25:58,653 --> 00:26:01,451
Come on and get this over with.
You're wasting my time.

288
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:03,970
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

289
00:26:04,133 --> 00:26:07,205
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye. Take it easy.

290
00:26:13,853 --> 00:26:14,888
Goodbye.

291
00:26:15,853 --> 00:26:16,922
Goodbye.

292
00:26:32,853 --> 00:26:35,526
You two, follow me.
The rest of you, get back to the camp.

293
00:26:41,373 --> 00:26:43,648
-He wouldn't stay up there.
-Good.

294
00:26:43,813 --> 00:26:47,203
Give me another chance.
l'll find another tree.

295
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:49,603
l'll give you both another chance.

296
00:26:49,773 --> 00:26:53,129
From now on,
you'll be my personal servants. . .

297
00:26:53,293 --> 00:26:57,525
. . .but you will only know me
as the Marquis de San Marco.

298
00:26:57,693 --> 00:27:00,287
-Do you understand?
-Marquis de San Marco.

299
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,921
That's it. Do. . .?

300
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:07,201
-Do you understand?
-Yes, Mr. Diavolo.

301
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:11,090
lf ever you breathe the name
of Diavolo again. . .

302
00:27:11,253 --> 00:27:13,562
. . .or tell anyone who l am. . .

303
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:16,042
. . .l'll find a tree for both of you.

304
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:18,566
Take these to the camp.

305
00:27:18,893 --> 00:27:23,808
And after you've cleaned them,
washed them and currycombed them. . .

306
00:27:23,973 --> 00:27:25,645
. . .send them to me.

307
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:32,484
lsn't that nice?
Now l don't have to hang you.

308
00:27:32,653 --> 00:27:36,328
And l don't have to have my throat cut,
and we can--

309
00:27:36,493 --> 00:27:40,406
-What's that for?
-My son.

310
00:27:57,933 --> 00:27:59,685
Will there be anything else, milady?

311
00:27:59,853 --> 00:28:04,643
-Oh, just straighten up this confusion.
-Yes, milady.

312
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:08,323
Oh, those horrible, horrible bandits.

313
00:28:08,693 --> 00:28:12,242
And all those beautiful jewels
l gave you, gone.

314
00:28:12,653 --> 00:28:15,087
All save one, milord.

315
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:25,767
And my money?

316
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:35,807
Safe as a bug in a rug.

317
00:28:36,653 --> 00:28:40,168
Clever of me to think
of having it sewn in your petticoat.

318
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:44,008
l wouldn't dare travel in this country
with so much money on me.

319
00:28:44,173 --> 00:28:46,892
But perhaps someone may find it on me.

320
00:28:47,213 --> 00:28:49,283
What--? What--? Why. . . .

321
00:28:49,733 --> 00:28:54,887
Who, my dear, besides myself,
would be likely to see your lingerie, huh?

322
00:28:57,493 --> 00:28:59,211
No one but you, milord.

323
00:29:38,533 --> 00:29:41,093
One would think, my dear,
you'd never seen a sedan chair.

324
00:29:44,453 --> 00:29:47,968
l am the Marquis de San Marco.

325
00:29:49,293 --> 00:29:53,764
lf your inn pleases me, l shall want
the best accommodations for myself. . .

326
00:29:53,933 --> 00:29:56,845
. . .and retinue.

327
00:30:06,413 --> 00:30:09,610
All our thoughts
will be for your comfort, milord.

328
00:30:09,773 --> 00:30:13,049
You may have any suite in the house,
Your Excellency.

329
00:30:13,213 --> 00:30:15,329
Except our suite, l trust.

330
00:30:17,533 --> 00:30:22,482
Milord, l would sleep in the barn
rather than discommode you.

331
00:30:22,773 --> 00:30:25,162
Find out your quarters
and await my pleasure.

332
00:30:41,053 --> 00:30:44,409
Don't lift until l tell you.

333
00:30:48,373 --> 00:30:49,772
Up.

334
00:30:52,933 --> 00:30:57,404
-Prepare everything comfortable, please.
-Yes. Go fetch your best linen.

335
00:31:39,373 --> 00:31:42,206
What do you think
you're trying to do to my bull?

336
00:31:52,893 --> 00:31:56,249
And you had to wave a red handkerchief.

337
00:31:58,253 --> 00:32:00,721
Remember the song
you were teaching me in the coach?

338
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:04,090
Could l forget
the happiest hour of my life?

339
00:32:06,933 --> 00:32:09,925
Pamela. Pamela.

340
00:32:13,253 --> 00:32:16,325
Are you going to stay out there
all afternoon?

341
00:32:23,813 --> 00:32:25,610
<i>For you.</i>

342
00:32:27,853 --> 00:32:31,402
Beauty from the beautiful.

343
00:32:41,413 --> 00:32:46,851
Oh, l know l'm just going to love
this romantic old inn.

344
00:32:50,773 --> 00:32:52,001
Look.

345
00:33:02,813 --> 00:33:04,371
What does it say?

346
00:33:04,533 --> 00:33:09,607
There's a reward of 20,000 lire
offered for the capture of Diavolo.

347
00:33:15,373 --> 00:33:16,886
Come here.

348
00:33:18,093 --> 00:33:21,210
All we've got to do
is to capture Diavolo. . .

349
00:33:21,373 --> 00:33:27,084
. . .and we've got another fortune
right in the palm of our hands.

350
00:33:29,973 --> 00:33:31,372
Come on.

351
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:38,883
l hope everything will be
to your satisfaction, Your Highness.

352
00:33:39,053 --> 00:33:41,647
-l know l'm going to be very happy here.
-Thank you.

353
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:11,047
Oh, my dear,
l think l require a little exercise.

354
00:34:11,213 --> 00:34:13,773
l'll stroll around the garden for a while.

355
00:34:13,933 --> 00:34:16,572
l'll be back in an hour or so.

356
00:34:16,733 --> 00:34:21,488
Time will hang heavy, my sweet,
until you return.

357
00:34:51,373 --> 00:34:54,922
-Where is the marquis's room?
-Right in there, sir.

358
00:35:16,213 --> 00:35:18,204
At your service, milady.

359
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:24,684
Oh, don't be afraid.
l simply had to see you.

360
00:35:25,933 --> 00:35:29,130
You're a naughty, naughty boy.

361
00:35:31,013 --> 00:35:32,526
Are you angry?

362
00:35:35,773 --> 00:35:38,924
l'm very, very angry.

363
00:35:41,213 --> 00:35:44,649
Angry enough to--? To kiss me?

364
00:36:07,213 --> 00:36:09,568
-Tie him up. Tie him up.
-Let me out of here. Let me go.

365
00:36:09,733 --> 00:36:12,327
Let me-- Let me-- Let me go.

366
00:36:12,773 --> 00:36:16,129
-Let me go, l say.
-Oh, no, don't. . . .

367
00:36:16,293 --> 00:36:18,090
Put his arm in place.

368
00:36:18,253 --> 00:36:19,606
Who is it? What has happened?

369
00:36:19,773 --> 00:36:21,126
Help me! Please help me!

370
00:36:21,293 --> 00:36:24,808
-Would you get that rope on my neck--?
-Let me go. Let me go.

371
00:36:24,973 --> 00:36:29,524
What is the matter? Help me!
Let me get out! Help!

372
00:36:29,693 --> 00:36:31,684
Hit him with something
so he'll keep quiet.

373
00:36:31,853 --> 00:36:33,525
Help get something. . . .

374
00:36:35,613 --> 00:36:38,810
-Hit him and keep him quiet.
-l don't know what's gonna happen--

375
00:36:38,973 --> 00:36:41,612
What's the matter? Let me go.

376
00:36:42,373 --> 00:36:46,889
Let me go. Let me go. Let me-- Let me--
Let me get up now, will you?

377
00:36:47,533 --> 00:36:49,285
Come on, before it's too late.

378
00:36:49,733 --> 00:36:53,282
Oh, well, anyway, l saw to it that they
didn't find my husband's money.

379
00:36:53,453 --> 00:36:56,525
lmagine a woman
outwitting the great Diavolo.

380
00:36:56,693 --> 00:36:59,685
Oh, the bandits could've found it,
had they looked in the right place.

381
00:36:59,853 --> 00:37:02,242
And that place was?

382
00:37:10,533 --> 00:37:12,967
l couldn't tell you.

383
00:37:17,973 --> 00:37:23,047
There's no use struggling, Mr. Diavolo.
Your bandit days are over.

384
00:37:26,173 --> 00:37:28,687
Let me out of here.
Let me out of here.

385
00:37:29,693 --> 00:37:33,208
-Not until we get the reward.
-What reward?

386
00:37:33,373 --> 00:37:36,809
The reward for your capture,
Mr. Diavolo.

387
00:37:36,973 --> 00:37:39,248
-You let me out of here.
-Let you--?

388
00:37:39,493 --> 00:37:44,328
That reminds me.
l'm an overfed windbag, am l?

389
00:37:46,613 --> 00:37:48,490
l tell you, l'm not Diavolo.

390
00:37:48,653 --> 00:37:52,487
You don't have to disguise your voice.
We know who you are.

391
00:37:53,853 --> 00:37:55,923
What are you going to do with me?

392
00:37:56,093 --> 00:37:58,891
We're going to hang you
from the highest tree.

393
00:37:59,173 --> 00:38:02,563
The terror of the countryside, huh?

394
00:38:05,613 --> 00:38:11,370
Don't do that.
Why, if l had my way, l'd boil you in oil.

395
00:38:12,413 --> 00:38:15,371
-What do you want?
-You'll pay for this.

396
00:38:15,533 --> 00:38:17,171
Shut up.

397
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:51,610
Oh, did--? Come--

398
00:39:45,933 --> 00:39:47,002
Get up out of there.

399
00:39:48,173 --> 00:39:49,367
Come on, quickly.

400
00:39:53,973 --> 00:39:56,965
-Wind that.
-That?

401
00:39:57,253 --> 00:39:59,005
Wind that.

402
00:40:11,213 --> 00:40:15,126
So you'd have me boiled in oil,
would you?

403
00:40:15,293 --> 00:40:16,965
Now, listen.

404
00:40:17,133 --> 00:40:20,523
One more trick like that,
you big puffed-up bullfrog. . .

405
00:40:20,693 --> 00:40:23,924
. . .and l'll cut out your gizzard
like this:

406
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:53,416
Oh, milady, your things are so beautiful.
You have everything.

407
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:58,937
Yes, everything save one, Zerlina:
romance.

408
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:02,136
Pamela. Pamela. Where is my nightcap?

409
00:41:03,699 --> 00:41:08,375
On your head, you silly little goose.

410
00:41:12,379 --> 00:41:16,372
-l trust milord is enjoying his supper.
-Too well, Matteo.

411
00:41:16,539 --> 00:41:19,849
l'm afraid your excellent cheese
will steal my rest.

412
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,896
Milord sleeps lightly?

413
00:41:22,059 --> 00:41:25,210
Well, sleep seldom visits me
before the dawn.

414
00:41:25,379 --> 00:41:28,530
Affairs of state
weigh heavily on my mind.

415
00:41:29,979 --> 00:41:33,654
ls there anything l could do
to help you rest?

416
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,695
Yes, l think you can.

417
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:39,809
Have you any sleeping powders?

418
00:41:39,979 --> 00:41:44,689
l have just the thing, milord,
left over from a bad attack of gout.

419
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:48,852
-l'll guarantee you slumber until morning.
-Oh, thanks, Matteo.

420
00:41:55,299 --> 00:42:00,089
-What are you doing?
-l'm playing Kneesie, Earsie, Nosie.

421
00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:05,456
-''Kneesie, Earsie, Nosie. ''
-Try it.

422
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:09,168
l don't wanna try it.
Anybody can do that.

423
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:36,214
Do that again.

424
00:43:03,099 --> 00:43:06,216
Kneesie, Earsie, Nosie.

425
00:43:08,459 --> 00:43:13,977
Here they are, milord. One will be plenty.
They are very strong.

426
00:43:16,539 --> 00:43:19,611
-Send my servants to me.
-Yes, milord.

427
00:43:39,259 --> 00:43:42,296
The marquis wishes to see you
right away.

428
00:44:12,419 --> 00:44:15,331
Take this wine to Lord Rocburg
with my compliments. . .

429
00:44:15,499 --> 00:44:16,898
. . .then come back here.

430
00:44:51,819 --> 00:44:56,370
l beg your pardon.
With the marquis's compliments.

431
00:44:57,019 --> 00:45:01,649
Kindly inform the marquis
l am very particular with whom l drink.

432
00:45:23,979 --> 00:45:25,492
Why did you drink that?

433
00:45:26,459 --> 00:45:28,415
Well, l was afraid l might spill it.

434
00:45:30,779 --> 00:45:32,212
Come on.

435
00:45:39,099 --> 00:45:42,011
Afraid of spilling it.

436
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,296
What are you trying to do,
break your necks?

437
00:45:58,699 --> 00:46:01,088
Oh, l should have done it for you
in the first place.

438
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:05,214
-Did you see His Lordship?
-Yes, sir.

439
00:46:06,259 --> 00:46:08,568
So far, so good.

440
00:46:09,939 --> 00:46:11,611
Now, this is my plan.

441
00:46:11,779 --> 00:46:14,418
You're to wait in the courtyard
until the house is quiet.

442
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:19,175
Then, when you hear my signal,
you're to climb up to the balcony.

443
00:46:19,419 --> 00:46:22,491
-Will your signal be a whistle?
-Will my signal be a whistle?

444
00:46:22,659 --> 00:46:25,253
Of course not.
Do you want to arouse the entire house?

445
00:46:25,419 --> 00:46:28,968
At the proper time,
l'll sing a certain song.

446
00:46:29,139 --> 00:46:32,973
<i>Silence befriending</i>
<i>To aid us conspires</i>

447
00:46:33,139 --> 00:46:37,496
<i>Prudence attending</i>
<i>Vengeance inspires</i>

448
00:46:37,659 --> 00:46:38,978
-You can remember it?
-Yes, sir.

449
00:46:39,139 --> 00:46:41,334
-You're not gonna forget it?
-No, sir.

450
00:46:45,539 --> 00:46:46,574
Do you remember it?

451
00:46:52,459 --> 00:46:53,892
Sing it.

452
00:46:54,859 --> 00:46:56,417
Sing it.

453
00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:59,571
<i>On yonder rock reclining, Diavolo--</i>

454
00:46:59,739 --> 00:47:01,013
Shut up.

455
00:47:02,299 --> 00:47:05,018
You stupid fool.
Do you wanna get us all hung?

456
00:47:05,179 --> 00:47:09,058
lf l hear a single note of that song again,
l'll-- l'll cut out your tongue.

457
00:47:09,219 --> 00:47:12,291
Calm yourself, milord.
l'll see that he never does it again.

458
00:47:12,459 --> 00:47:14,609
When you hear the signal,
you climb up the balcony.

459
00:47:14,779 --> 00:47:15,928
-Yes, sir.
-Now, get out.

460
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:17,327
All right.

461
00:47:19,259 --> 00:47:21,693
Should you require anything
during the night, milady. . .

462
00:47:21,859 --> 00:47:24,612
. . .l will be resting
right outside your door.

463
00:47:24,779 --> 00:47:27,373
That's very thoughtful, my dear.
Good night.

464
00:47:27,539 --> 00:47:29,370
Good night, milady.

465
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:55,617
Wake up. Don't you know
there's work to be done?

466
00:47:55,779 --> 00:47:57,212
Did you hear what he said?

467
00:47:57,379 --> 00:48:00,610
When he sings that song,
we've got to climb the balcony.

468
00:48:20,419 --> 00:48:23,092
Now, wake up.

469
00:48:23,499 --> 00:48:27,572
What's the matter with you? Wake up.

470
00:49:08,459 --> 00:49:12,088
<i>Silence befriending</i>
<i>To aid us conspires</i>

471
00:49:12,259 --> 00:49:15,569

472
00:49:17,139 --> 00:49:22,133
There's the signal. Come on.
Come on, come on, there's the signal.

473
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:27,094

Come on, get out of there
and help me get these. . . .

477
00:49:45,019 --> 00:49:50,047
Get that table over there.
And wake up. Now, go ahead.

478
00:50:05,699 --> 00:50:07,769
Turn it around.

479
00:50:07,939 --> 00:50:10,134
Turn it around.

480
00:50:25,819 --> 00:50:27,650
Hand me that chair.

481
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:10,697
Hey. Hey. Wake up.

482
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,258
Hey, wake up.

483
00:51:25,659 --> 00:51:28,969
Quiet. Quiet, you fools.
Do you want to spoil everything?

484
00:51:29,379 --> 00:51:30,368
Follow me.

485
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:05,576
Oh, wait. Get off of my back.

486
00:52:10,579 --> 00:52:12,888
-Come on.
-l can't come up.

487
00:52:13,059 --> 00:52:14,890
Help me get out of here.

488
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:17,050
You idiots. What are you trying to do?

489
00:52:17,219 --> 00:52:18,857
Help me get him up.

490
00:52:20,539 --> 00:52:22,370
Take it easy, now.

491
00:52:22,779 --> 00:52:25,816
Take it easy, now. There, that's it.

492

505
00:55:25,499 --> 00:55:29,617
<i>Raise the grateful voice</i>
<i>Raise the grateful voice</i>

506
00:55:29,779 --> 00:55:31,212
<i>We'll come with victory crowned</i>

507
00:55:31,379 --> 00:55:33,176
Milord, milord.

508
00:55:33,339 --> 00:55:35,216
-The soldiers are returning.
-The soldiers?

509
00:55:37,699 --> 00:55:41,533
<i>Still let that cry aloud resound</i>

510
00:55:41,699 --> 00:55:47,774
<i>Victoria, Victoria, Victoria</i>

511
00:55:47,939 --> 00:55:51,693
<i>Still let that cry aloud resound</i>

512
00:55:51,859 --> 00:55:57,695
<i>Victoria, Victoria, Victoria</i>

513
00:55:57,859 --> 00:56:01,568
<i>Still let that cry aloud resound</i>

514
00:56:01,739 --> 00:56:05,175
<i>Still let that cry aloud resound</i>

515
00:56:05,339 --> 00:56:08,411
<i>Still let that cry aloud resound</i>

516
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:11,616
<i>Let the cry, let the cry</i>

517
00:56:11,779 --> 00:56:17,411
<i>Let the cry aloud resound</i>

518
00:56:18,339 --> 00:56:19,977
Dismissed.

519
00:56:22,819 --> 00:56:25,458
What luck? Did you catch
that murderous rogue?

520
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:26,654
We didn't get Diavolo.

521
00:56:26,819 --> 00:56:29,174
But we found his hiding place
and killed 20 of his men.

522
00:56:29,339 --> 00:56:31,057
Bravo, bravo.

523
00:56:31,219 --> 00:56:33,574
Thank heavens you're safe.

524
00:56:34,339 --> 00:56:37,058
Come, come, my dear. This night air.

525
00:57:10,299 --> 00:57:12,415
Oh, Lorenzo.

526
00:57:35,099 --> 00:57:39,411
<i>'Tis Easter day, 'tis Easter day</i>

00:57:57,379 --> 00:58:01,577
Welcome, Francesco.
l am honored to call you my son.

535
00:58:01,739 --> 00:58:05,971
Well, l'll admit, Father-in-law,
you might have done worse.

536
00:58:06,139 --> 00:58:09,734
Francesco, the bride is waiting
for your kiss.

537
00:58:10,819 --> 00:58:13,970
This is a lucky day for you, my dear.

538
00:58:18,379 --> 00:58:22,133
-l trust everything is prepared.
-Nothing but the very best.

539
00:58:22,299 --> 00:58:24,608
l'll take a look around and make sure.

540
00:58:24,979 --> 00:58:30,133
Come in, friends. Welcome. There's
plenty to drink, there's plenty to eat.

541
00:58:31,619 --> 00:58:33,530
<i>Hail, blessed morning</i>

542
00:58:33,699 --> 00:58:37,408
<i>--blessed morning</i>
<i>Nature adorning</i>

543
00:58:37,579 --> 00:58:40,969

546
00:58:45,779 --> 00:58:47,258
What are you doing?

547
00:58:47,419 --> 00:58:49,853
l'm playing Finger-Wiggle.

548
00:58:50,339 --> 00:58:52,694
-What?
-Finger-Wiggle.

549
00:58:52,859 --> 00:58:57,375
F-l-inger, finger.
W-l-iggle, wiggle.

550
00:58:57,699 --> 00:58:59,417
Finger-Wiggle.

551
00:59:02,219 --> 00:59:03,777
Hold that.

552
00:59:28,819 --> 00:59:30,855
Finger-Wiggle.

553
00:59:40,259 --> 00:59:41,453
Do that again.

554
01:00:19,899 --> 01:00:23,335
All night long, l could not sleep.

555
01:00:23,499 --> 01:00:25,854
l try to do this.

556
01:00:27,259 --> 01:00:28,851
Couldn't do it.

557
01:00:29,019 --> 01:00:32,728
Now you worry me with this.

558
01:00:34,419 --> 01:00:38,537
What l wish you, l could not say.

559
01:00:43,299 --> 01:00:46,575
Help, help, help!

560
01:00:46,739 --> 01:00:50,778
Oh, l've been robbed, l've been robbed.
My medallion has been stolen!

561
01:00:50,939 --> 01:00:53,407
Do you hear?
We've been robbed in this very inn.

562
01:00:53,579 --> 01:00:56,047
-l am so sorry.
-No safety for guests in this house?

563
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:58,175
l tell you, something
must be done about this.

564
01:00:58,819 --> 01:01:01,174
l am so sorry, milord.

565
01:01:03,179 --> 01:01:05,977
l doubt, milady, if we'll have
to search far for the thief.

566
01:01:06,139 --> 01:01:08,050
Do you know,
l think you're right, captain.

567
01:01:08,219 --> 01:01:12,053
Do you remember a figure in uniform
climbing up to the balcony last night?

568
01:01:12,619 --> 01:01:17,170
Of course l remember,
and l wondered what he was doing.

569
01:01:17,339 --> 01:01:19,933
Oh, yes, by the way,
what were you doing last night, captain?

570
01:01:20,339 --> 01:01:23,934
Why. . . . Why, after
l dismissed the troop, l. . . .

571
01:01:24,899 --> 01:01:26,173
l'd rather not say.

572
01:01:26,339 --> 01:01:28,409
This is no time to keep silent.

573
01:01:28,579 --> 01:01:31,252
l didn't climb the balcony
to steal your medallion, l swear.

574
01:01:31,419 --> 01:01:33,728
Well, l think the matter can be
cleared up very easily.

575
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:36,015
Why don't we all submit to a search.

576
01:01:36,339 --> 01:01:38,455
l'm not afraid to be searched.

577
01:01:43,739 --> 01:01:44,728
He hasn't anything.

578
01:01:44,899 --> 01:01:47,413
Captain, you've. . . .
You've forgotten your cape.

579
01:01:53,659 --> 01:01:55,809
My medallion!

580
01:01:55,979 --> 01:01:58,368
Milady, l will call the police.

581
01:01:58,579 --> 01:02:01,491
l tell you, l didn't steal it.
l don't know how it got into my cape.

582
01:02:01,659 --> 01:02:04,378
He's innocent, milady, l swear it.

583
01:02:04,539 --> 01:02:06,211
Please don't arrest him.

584
01:02:06,379 --> 01:02:09,416
lt was wrong of him to steal it,
but the motive was very touching.

585
01:02:09,619 --> 01:02:12,053
He stole it.
What does the motive matter?

586
01:02:12,539 --> 01:02:16,578
-Love makes us do strange things.
-Oh, milord.

587
01:02:16,819 --> 01:02:20,209
This young officer was too poor
to marry Zerlina. . .

588
01:02:20,379 --> 01:02:22,847
. . .and the medallion
would have made it possible.

589
01:02:24,339 --> 01:02:29,697
Oh, don't weep, my dear.
Love does create a great havoc.

590
01:02:30,299 --> 01:02:33,769
Love? All poppycock.

591
01:02:33,939 --> 01:02:38,171
l shall see to it, my dear,
that your sweetheart is not arrested.

592
01:02:38,339 --> 01:02:41,649
Oh, milady, l thank you.

593
01:02:41,819 --> 01:02:44,253
And l promise you that l shall prove
to you my innocence.

594
01:02:44,419 --> 01:02:48,571
And before this day is done,
l'll turn over to you the real thief.

595
01:02:53,699 --> 01:02:57,658
Doesn't it strike you as strange
that this Marquis de San Marco. . .

596
01:02:57,819 --> 01:03:00,094
. . .though traveling elaborately
around this country. . .

597
01:03:00,259 --> 01:03:02,409
. . .is never bothered by these bandits?

598
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:05,088
Well, that is so.

599
01:03:05,579 --> 01:03:07,729
Draw him into conversation
about Diavolo.

600
01:03:07,899 --> 01:03:10,015
Possibly we can learn something.

601
01:03:11,339 --> 01:03:13,899
lf you can go down the cellar
without breaking your necks. . .

602
01:03:14,059 --> 01:03:16,493
. . .bring up some of my best wine.

603
01:03:16,899 --> 01:03:18,298
Why, we're not your servants.

604
01:03:18,459 --> 01:03:22,930
The marquis's orders are that you are
to make yourself useful around here.

605
01:03:23,339 --> 01:03:25,773
And remember, my best wine.

606
01:03:25,939 --> 01:03:30,854
Chateau Lafite, 1 728. Now, hurry. Hurry.

607
01:03:39,619 --> 01:03:43,612
lt's odd that the distinguished marquis,
in all his travels over the country. . .

608
01:03:43,779 --> 01:03:45,292
. . .hasn't met this Diavolo.

609
01:03:45,459 --> 01:03:46,448
Oh, but l have.

610
01:03:46,619 --> 01:03:47,608
-What?
-Really?

611
01:03:47,779 --> 01:03:49,974
l haven't actually spoken with him.
l have seen him.

612
01:03:50,139 --> 01:03:52,653
-But where?
-Oh, do tell us.

613
01:03:52,819 --> 01:03:55,208
Well, late one evening
when l was returning home. . .

614
01:03:55,379 --> 01:03:57,495
. . .l heard a voice singing
high above me.

615
01:03:57,659 --> 01:04:02,608
And looking up, there he was,
black cloak, white plume and all.

616
01:04:02,779 --> 01:04:04,497
-How romantic.
-Yes, wasn't it?

617
01:04:04,659 --> 01:04:06,775
And if what he was singing
were true. . .

618
01:04:06,939 --> 01:04:09,692
. . .you know, he must be
quite a remarkable fellow.

619
01:04:09,859 --> 01:04:12,851
You know, curiously enough,
the song stayed with me.

620
01:04:13,019 --> 01:04:14,896
Let me see, how did it go?

621
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:16,458
l remember.

622
01:04:17,579 --> 01:04:21,970
<i>Proudly and wide</i>
<i>My standard flies</i>

623
01:04:22,139 --> 01:04:26,371
<i>For daring hearts</i>
<i>A noble band</i>

624
01:04:26,539 --> 01:04:28,495
<i>All own my sway</i>

625
01:04:28,659 --> 01:04:30,729
<i>Whilst for supplies</i>

626
01:04:30,899 --> 01:04:34,653
<i>Each traveler's wealth I freely command</i>

627
01:04:34,819 --> 01:04:36,855
<i>All own my sway</i>

628
01:04:37,019 --> 01:04:39,010
<i>Whilst for supplies</i>

629
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:43,411
<i>Each traveler's wealth I freely command</i>

630
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:49,132
<i>Now a banker I stop</i>

631

<i>Your gold, your gold</i>
<i>Your gold, your gold</i>

632
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:58,892
<i>And now a lord is brought</i>

633
01:04:59,059 --> 01:05:02,574
<i>Your gold, your gold</i>
<i>Your gold, your gold</i>

634
01:05:05,659 --> 01:05:08,969
<i>A lawyer next is caught</i>

635
01:05:09,139 --> 01:05:12,097
<i>Let justice be done</i>

636
01:05:12,259 --> 01:05:14,853
<i>Restore your plunder</i>

637
01:05:15,019 --> 01:05:17,055
<i>Even threefold</i>

638
01:05:21,019 --> 01:05:22,498
<i>Now</i>

639
01:05:22,659 --> 01:05:27,096
<i>A pilgrim before me is led</i>

640
01:05:29,779 --> 01:05:33,135
<i>''I have no gold</i>

641
01:05:33,299 --> 01:05:36,848
<i>I have no bread''</i>

642

<i>Here are both for you, friend</i>

643
01:05:41,819 --> 01:05:47,894
<i>Peace your footsteps attend</i>

644
01:05:48,899 --> 01:05:50,617
<i>So</i>

645
01:05:51,099 --> 01:05:52,691
<i>So</i>

646
01:05:53,339 --> 01:06:00,336
<i>Swift run the sands of time</i>

647
01:06:08,819 --> 01:06:10,775
<i>Then since life glides so fast away</i>

648
01:06:10,939 --> 01:06:12,975
<i>Let's enjoy it while yet we may</i>

649
01:06:13,139 --> 01:06:17,018
<i>For fate so kind today</i>
<i>Perhaps tomorrow may betray</i>

650
01:06:17,179 --> 01:06:19,056
<i>As new dangers our steps surround</i>

<i>Every moment may be your last</i>

652
01:06:21,099 --> 01:06:25,297

653
01:06:29,219 --> 01:06:33,053
<i>Oh, what joys divine</i>
<i>Does the brigand's station combine?</i>

654
01:06:33,219 --> 01:06:36,529
<i>Still gay and at ease</i>
<i>Just as a king I do as I please</i>

655
01:06:36,699 --> 01:06:40,374
<i>I plunder, rob, take people's lives</i>
<i>Bear off both husbands and their wives</i>

656
01:06:40,539 --> 01:06:44,418
<i>And oft their hearts to beat I've made</i>
<i>The last with love, the first with dread</i>

657
01:06:44,579 --> 01:06:49,937
<i>One trembling bows with hat in hand</i>
<i>The other smiles and says</i>

658
01:06:50,099 --> 01:06:51,771
''Dear brigand. ''

659
01:06:52,419 --> 01:06:54,614

674
01:07:38,939 --> 01:07:42,136
<i>Passed</i>

675
01:08:09,339 --> 01:08:11,978
Watch what you're doing.

676
01:08:42,779 --> 01:08:44,895
Hold this while l get off the ladder.

677
01:08:45,059 --> 01:08:47,129
Wait till l put the candle down.

678
01:09:30,139 --> 01:09:31,731
Wait a minute.

679
01:09:44,699 --> 01:09:48,897
Now, when l fill this with wine,
l'll hand it to you.

680
01:09:49,059 --> 01:09:52,369
Then you pour it in there.

681
01:09:57,099 --> 01:09:58,737
Simple.

682
01:10:38,779 --> 01:10:40,849
l've been waiting so patiently for you.

683
01:10:43,059 --> 01:10:45,254
How did you know l'd come here?

684
01:10:45,419 --> 01:10:47,250
Love told me.

685
01:10:47,419 --> 01:10:49,808
Oh, but, milord, you shouldn't be here
in my bedroom.

686
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:53,494
Why not?
l simply had to see you alone.

687
01:11:00,259 --> 01:11:03,217
You're much too fascinating a man.

688
01:11:03,379 --> 01:11:05,609
l think l'd better go.

689
01:11:09,699 --> 01:11:12,850
What's the matter? Afraid?

690
01:11:15,379 --> 01:11:17,654
You funny man.

691
01:11:19,139 --> 01:11:21,016
Of course not.

692
01:11:22,499 --> 01:11:24,091
Well, l am.

693
01:11:24,259 --> 01:11:26,136
You afraid, milord?

694
01:11:26,299 --> 01:11:30,338
-Of what?
-Of you and for you.

695
01:11:30,499 --> 01:11:33,491
-For me?
-And your safety.

696
01:11:34,339 --> 01:11:38,093
But l have my medallion.
And perhaps they'll find my jewels.

697
01:11:38,259 --> 01:11:41,376
Yes, but supposing
they steal your money.

698
01:11:41,739 --> 01:11:47,655
As l've told you before, milord,
our money is securely hidden.

699
01:11:47,819 --> 01:11:51,414
Well, who guards it so loyally?

700
01:11:51,579 --> 01:11:53,092
l do.

701
01:11:53,259 --> 01:11:54,294
You do?

702
01:11:54,459 --> 01:11:57,496
Well, l-- l don't see it on you.

703
01:12:00,419 --> 01:12:02,614
Of course you don't.

704
01:12:02,779 --> 01:12:05,532
Though it's not very far from you.

705
01:12:05,699 --> 01:12:08,657
Well. . . . Well, let me guess
where it's hidden.

706
01:12:08,819 --> 01:12:10,047
ls it in your bag?

707
01:12:11,219 --> 01:12:14,211
lt's much nearer to me than that.

708
01:12:15,259 --> 01:12:17,375
ls it. . .

709
01:12:17,699 --> 01:12:19,849
. . .in your bodice?

710
01:12:23,499 --> 01:12:25,012
l know.

711
01:12:25,499 --> 01:12:28,411
lt's hidden in the folds of your gown.

712
01:12:29,619 --> 01:12:32,008
-Oh, milord.
-ls it. . .?

713
01:12:32,179 --> 01:12:35,967
ls it very close to your fair white skin?

714
01:12:36,139 --> 01:12:37,652
ls it?

715
01:12:43,419 --> 01:12:46,809
Oh, but that isn't close
to your white skin.

716
01:12:55,259 --> 01:12:56,897
Do you mean to tell me. . .

717
01:12:57,059 --> 01:13:01,814
. . .that 500,000 francs is concealed
in that little bit of silk and lace?

718
01:13:37,619 --> 01:13:39,371
Why do you tempt me so
with your beauty?

719
01:13:39,539 --> 01:13:41,291
Oh, please, milord, please.

720
01:13:41,459 --> 01:13:43,689
Don't you know
that l'm falling in love with you?

721
01:13:43,859 --> 01:13:46,737
And that l can't bear the thought of you
belonging to someone else?

722
01:13:46,899 --> 01:13:49,857
But l do belong to someone else,
and we must remember--

723
01:13:50,019 --> 01:13:52,579
l remember nothing else
except that l love you. . .

724
01:13:52,739 --> 01:13:55,458
. . .and l can't stand the temptation
of being near you.

725
01:13:55,619 --> 01:13:58,929
Pamela, l. . . . l can't give you up.

726
01:13:59,099 --> 01:14:01,977
-And yet l dare not stay.
-Oh, but, milord. . .

727
01:14:02,139 --> 01:14:06,052
. . .l've come to depend on you
for the only light and gaiety in my life.

728
01:14:06,219 --> 01:14:08,813
Surely we can still be friends?

729
01:14:08,979 --> 01:14:12,210
Do you think, with the perfume
of your hair, the light in your eyes. . .

730
01:14:12,379 --> 01:14:15,257
. . .the nearness of your lovely self
always tempting me. . .

731
01:14:15,419 --> 01:14:18,934
. . .that we can be friends?

732
01:15:44,779 --> 01:15:46,132
Let me look at you.

733
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:53,056
You're spiffed.

734
01:16:01,059 --> 01:16:03,015
Look at you.

735
01:16:03,579 --> 01:16:06,491
Pull yourself together.
Let's get out of here.

736
01:16:31,419 --> 01:16:33,979
Put that ladder back and come on.

737
01:16:35,619 --> 01:16:38,691
Oh, Pamela, l don't want to remember
you in these formal silks and satins.

738
01:16:38,859 --> 01:16:42,295
l want to remember you as you were last
night on the balcony in the moonlight. . .

739
01:16:42,459 --> 01:16:44,848
. . .with your hair framing
your lovely face like a halo. . .

740
01:16:45,019 --> 01:16:48,489
. . .and your soft, clinging robe
caressing your white skin.

741
01:16:48,859 --> 01:16:52,693
Would it please milord very much
to see me in that robe again?

742
01:16:52,859 --> 01:16:56,568
lt would mean everything
in the world to me.

743
01:17:02,019 --> 01:17:08,015
Now, you sit right down here and
don't dare turn around until l call you.

744
01:17:20,459 --> 01:17:22,609
What's the matter with you?

745
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:32,970
l'm spiffed.

746
01:17:33,379 --> 01:17:35,734
Do you want everybody to know it?

747
01:17:35,899 --> 01:17:37,935
Now, brace up.

748
01:18:04,059 --> 01:18:05,970
My son.

749
01:18:12,419 --> 01:18:16,458
You-- You were gonna have me stuffed.

750
01:19:00,099 --> 01:19:01,134
Oh, Lorenzo.

751
01:19:04,739 --> 01:19:06,969
Do you remember. . .?

752
01:19:13,499 --> 01:19:17,333
<i>For a servant there's no denying</i>

753
01:19:17,499 --> 01:19:21,128
<i>There's a shape that's not much amiss</i>

754
01:19:22,099 --> 01:19:25,728
<i>There's no cause</i>
<i>I fancy for sighing</i>

755
01:19:25,899 --> 01:19:28,891
<i>When one boasts such a figure as this</i>

756
01:19:29,059 --> 01:19:33,177
<i>I'm sure, I'm sure</i>
<i>There are some more....</i>

757
01:19:36,019 --> 01:19:37,611
That song.

758
01:19:37,779 --> 01:19:41,010
Why, my dear, all men sing
when they're in their cups.

759
01:19:41,179 --> 01:19:42,453
You don't understand.

760
01:19:42,619 --> 01:19:45,417
l sang that song last night
while undressing. . .

761
01:19:45,579 --> 01:19:47,615
. . .never dreaming that anyone was near.

762
01:19:47,779 --> 01:19:49,212
Well?

763
01:19:49,379 --> 01:19:52,576
lf he was close enough
to hear that song. . .

764
01:19:52,739 --> 01:19:55,731
. . .maybe he knows
who stole the medallion.

765
01:19:56,259 --> 01:19:58,090
l see.

766
01:19:58,579 --> 01:20:03,095
Well, now we are getting someplace.

767
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:20,447
Where did you hear that song
you were singing?

768
01:20:23,219 --> 01:20:25,653
Answer my question
or l'll place you under arrest.

769
01:20:25,819 --> 01:20:28,572
Please, sir, we haven't done anything.

770
01:20:29,219 --> 01:20:33,258
Tell me where you heard that song
or l'll throw you into prison. Both of you.

771
01:20:33,419 --> 01:20:35,216
You leave us alone.

772
01:20:35,379 --> 01:20:38,212
lf you don't, l'll tell Diavolo about you.

773
01:20:39,219 --> 01:20:44,339
He doesn't mean Diavolo, sir.
He means the Marquis de San Marco.

774
01:20:46,899 --> 01:20:47,888
Lieutenant.

775
01:20:48,619 --> 01:20:52,498
Place a guard around the inn.
Let no one leave here without my order.

776
01:21:01,939 --> 01:21:05,818
Attention.
Outside and surround the inn.

777
01:21:28,419 --> 01:21:29,818
On guard.

778
01:21:40,659 --> 01:21:44,174
<i>On yonder rock reclining</i>

779
01:21:44,339 --> 01:21:48,298
<i>That fierce and swarthy form behold</i>

780
01:21:48,459 --> 01:21:50,893
<i>Fast his hand his carbine hold</i>

781
01:21:51,059 --> 01:21:53,368
-Diavolo.
-Diavolo.

782
01:21:54,939 --> 01:21:58,409
<i>Tremble!</i>

783
01:21:58,579 --> 01:22:01,491
<i>Meanwhile the storm is beating</i>

784
01:22:01,659 --> 01:22:04,890
<i>Afar hear echo repeating</i>

785
01:22:05,659 --> 01:22:08,173
<i>Diavolo, Diavolo, Diavolo</i>

786
01:22:56,819 --> 01:22:58,969
-Mine, Diavolo.
-Come on.

787
01:23:02,619 --> 01:23:05,816
Arrest this man. Also his servants.

788
01:23:10,899 --> 01:23:12,617
Wait a minute.

789
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:14,770
Come on, you too.

790
01:23:16,299 --> 01:23:18,290
And now give me the jewels.

791
01:23:23,899 --> 01:23:25,810
-Oh, milord. Milord.
-Yes. Who? What? What?

792
01:23:25,979 --> 01:23:28,698
-Your jewels have been returned.
-My jewels have been returned?

793
01:23:28,859 --> 01:23:30,212
Where are they?
Where are they?

794
01:23:30,619 --> 01:23:34,168
What is this? My jewels.

795
01:23:34,339 --> 01:23:35,738
Liar. Thief.

796
01:23:35,899 --> 01:23:41,019
Milord, if it's not asking too much,
the captain would appreciate his reward.

797
01:23:41,179 --> 01:23:45,297
Reward? Reward? But-- But, my dear, l
never travel with so much money on me.

798
01:23:45,699 --> 01:23:48,418
However, l shall communicate
with my solicitor.

799
01:23:48,579 --> 01:23:54,290
But, milord, it's very important
that we-- He has the money now.

800
01:23:54,459 --> 01:23:55,858
Oh, milord, excuse me.

801
01:23:56,019 --> 01:24:00,535
As the captain has other plans for me,
and as l have a little money of my own. . .

802
01:24:00,699 --> 01:24:03,054
. . .allow me to advance the reward.

803
01:24:03,219 --> 01:24:05,369
But l forbid it.

804
01:24:05,539 --> 01:24:07,416
l want to be under no obligation to you.

805
01:24:07,579 --> 01:24:10,457
You are under no obligations to me.

806
01:24:15,179 --> 01:24:16,737
My--

807
01:24:20,659 --> 01:24:23,571
-Father Matteo.
-My son.

808
01:24:29,019 --> 01:24:31,169
Milord.

809
01:24:35,419 --> 01:24:38,411
What kept you so long, my marquis?

810
01:24:45,779 --> 01:24:47,929
Have you anything to say
before you are shot?

811
01:24:48,099 --> 01:24:50,693
-No.
-No, sir.

812
01:24:57,019 --> 01:24:59,852
Squad, ready.

813
01:25:00,019 --> 01:25:01,168
Aim.

814
01:25:02,779 --> 01:25:05,247
-Well?
-Please, may l blow my nose?

815
01:25:05,419 --> 01:25:07,091
Hurry up, then.

816
01:25:16,779 --> 01:25:18,098
Diavolo!
