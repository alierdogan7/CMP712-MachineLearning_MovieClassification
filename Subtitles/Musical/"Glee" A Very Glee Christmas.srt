1
00:00:00,323 --> 00:00:01,747
<i>So here's what you missed
on Glee:</i>

2
00:00:02,173 --> 00:00:04,241
<i>Kurt's trying to get used</i>

3
00:00:04,292 --> 00:00:05,842
<i>to another school, and Will's
trying to get used to the fact</i>

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,244
<i>that Emma went to Vegas with
her boyfriend</i>

5
00:00:07,295 --> 00:00:08,779
<i>- and came home married.</i>
- I'm happy for you.

6
00:00:08,846 --> 00:00:10,013
<i>Brittany thinks Artie's
the best boyfriend ever.</i>

7
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:11,815
You're magic, Brittany.

8
00:00:11,883 --> 00:00:13,450
<i>Which is what Rachel used to
think about Finn.</i>

9
00:00:13,518 --> 00:00:16,086
<i>But then she learned this
secret about him and Santana</i>

10
00:00:16,154 --> 00:00:18,321
<i>- which made her super mad.</i>
- Do you think she's prettier than me?

11
00:00:18,389 --> 00:00:20,056
<i>- Don't answer that.</i>
- So she made out with Puck,

12
00:00:20,124 --> 00:00:21,758
- which made Finn super mad.
- I'm done with you!

13
00:00:21,826 --> 00:00:23,360
<i>Because his girlfriends are
always making out with Puck.</i>

14
00:00:23,427 --> 00:00:24,794
Boyfriend troubles.
I got that covered.

15
00:00:24,846 --> 00:00:26,179
Considering I'm usually

16
00:00:26,264 --> 00:00:28,265
the cause of them,
I'd say I'm an expert.

17
00:00:28,332 --> 00:00:30,133
<i>It's like a thing. And that's
what you missed on Glee.</i>

18
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,537
(school bell ringing)

19
00:00:35,796 --> 00:00:38,664
- Hey, Will.
- Hey.

20
00:00:41,368 --> 00:00:43,636
Are we okay?

21
00:00:43,704 --> 00:00:45,204
You know, we haven't
really talked

22
00:00:45,272 --> 00:00:46,806
since I told you
about me and Carl.

23
00:00:46,873 --> 00:00:49,008
I mean, we haven't
talked at all.

24
00:00:49,076 --> 00:00:50,610
Are you avoiding me?

25
00:00:50,621 --> 00:00:52,055
Not at all.

26
00:00:54,292 --> 00:00:56,960
So, what are you doing for
Christmas this year?

27
00:00:57,028 --> 00:00:59,095
Just a little quiet time alone
this year.

28
00:00:59,163 --> 00:01:02,465
Will, you can't spend Christmas
by yourself. That's horrible.

29
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:05,719
Look, um, Carl and I are having
a big Christmas Eve party.

30
00:01:05,803 --> 00:01:07,437
Please at least stop by.

31
00:01:07,505 --> 00:01:11,558
Well, thanks, Emma, that's very
sweet of you guys, but...

32
00:01:11,642 --> 00:01:13,777
I think it's best if we just

33
00:01:13,845 --> 00:01:15,712
keep things separate
for a while.

34
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,848
Yeah, okay.

35
00:01:17,915 --> 00:01:20,016
BEISTE:
Okay, educators, gather around.

36
00:01:20,084 --> 00:01:21,318
It's time to pick
your Secret Santa.

37
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:23,420
Everybody's name
is in the tub.

38
00:01:23,487 --> 00:01:26,323
You get who you get, and you
don't get upset, all right?

39
00:01:34,732 --> 00:01:36,099
(staff murmuring)

40
00:01:38,836 --> 00:01:40,837
(school bell ringing)

41
00:01:40,888 --> 00:01:43,974
BRITTANY:
There.

42
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:47,561
Last year, I left my stocking
up over Christmas vacation,

43
00:01:47,645 --> 00:01:49,846
and an entire family of mice
started living in it.

44
00:01:49,914 --> 00:01:52,082
Their Christmas gift to
each other was rabies.

45
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:54,317
I told my parents that I
only want one thing

46
00:01:54,385 --> 00:01:55,785
for Christmas this year:

47
00:01:55,853 --> 00:01:58,088
Stop friend requesting me on
Facebook.

48
00:01:58,155 --> 00:02:00,457
What are you
asking Santa for?

49
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,927
- I'm sorry?
- Artie...

50
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:05,829
The roads to the North Pole
are getting treacherous.

51
00:02:05,897 --> 00:02:08,865
You need to write your
letter to Santa really fast

52
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:10,433
and get it in
the mail today.

53
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:13,370
And remember, even the smallest
envelope is heavy for an elf.

54
00:02:17,475 --> 00:02:19,542
No way.

Hey, guys.
What's this?

87
00:04:20,864 --> 00:04:23,466
Oh, we're trying to get into
the Christmas spirit, Mr. Shue.

88
00:04:23,534 --> 00:04:25,135
Christmas is totally my favorite
holiday. And check out

89
00:04:25,202 --> 00:04:27,370
this awesome tree! I found it on
the side of the road.

90
00:04:27,438 --> 00:04:29,506
It must have fell off
some guy's car.

91
00:04:29,573 --> 00:04:31,608
- And the ornaments?
- The guy who lives next door

92
00:04:31,675 --> 00:04:33,443
finally killed off his elderly mother.
And when they carted him off,

93
00:04:33,511 --> 00:04:35,345
they left the house, like,
wide open, so...

94
00:04:35,413 --> 00:04:36,613
I think she was
a holiday hoarder.

95
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,282
Uh... And the presents?

96
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,485
I lifted them from a display at the mall.
But don't worry. They're empty.

97
00:04:42,553 --> 00:04:44,154
Guys, look,
I appreciate the effort,

98
00:04:44,221 --> 00:04:46,573
but this isn't what Christmas is
supposed to be like.

99
00:04:46,657 --> 00:04:47,857
For us, it is.

100
00:04:47,925 --> 00:04:49,626
This tree is like a mascot for
Glee Club.

101
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:52,695
We won Sectionals
two years in a row,

102
00:04:52,763 --> 00:04:54,914
and according to everyone
at this school, we still suck.

103
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:56,566
...this reindeer sweater last
year...

104
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,238
- Ooh!
- Ho-Ho-Ho, losers.

105
00:05:02,306 --> 00:05:03,773
Haha!

106
00:05:03,841 --> 00:05:05,442
I'm pretty sure they just added
food coloring

107
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:06,876
to real slush
from the parking lot.

108
00:05:06,944 --> 00:05:07,944
You can eat that,
you know.

109
00:05:08,012 --> 00:05:09,345
No, no. I am not

110
00:05:09,413 --> 00:05:11,748
gonna let you guys throw
yourselves a pity party.

111
00:05:11,816 --> 00:05:14,484
Look, I'm the first one to say
that things haven't turned out

112
00:05:14,552 --> 00:05:17,287
exactly how I would have liked
them to this year, but Christmas

113
00:05:17,354 --> 00:05:20,423
is all about being grateful for
the things that did.

114
00:05:20,491 --> 00:05:21,825
I thought that was Thanksgiving.

115
00:05:21,892 --> 00:05:24,427
And this year, Glee Club is
going to lend a hand

116
00:05:24,495 --> 00:05:26,479
to the McKinney-Vento Homeless
Children and Youth program

117
00:05:26,564 --> 00:05:28,631
- right here in Lima.
- How are we going to do that?

118
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,651
The only way we know how:
By singing about it.

119
00:05:31,735 --> 00:05:33,136
We're going to go classroom
to classroom,

120
00:05:33,204 --> 00:05:35,038
caroling, to raise money for
McKinney-Vento.

121
00:05:35,105 --> 00:05:37,140
Wait, classrooms in this school?
With like, students in them?

122
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,676
Well, if there are no students
in them, there will be no one

123
00:05:39,743 --> 00:05:41,478
to put money in the collection
box while we sing.

124
00:05:41,545 --> 00:05:42,545
We're gonna be killed.

125
00:05:42,613 --> 00:05:44,180
No, guys, it's Christmas...

126
00:05:44,248 --> 00:05:46,049
A time for miracles.

127
00:05:46,117 --> 00:05:47,183
We got to try this.

128
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:49,886
Finn's right.

129
00:05:49,954 --> 00:05:51,888
So let's start rehearsing.

130
00:05:51,956 --> 00:05:55,725
This year, Glee Club's going
full Santa.

131
00:05:57,895 --> 00:06:00,980
♪ Haul out the holly. ♪

132
00:06:01,065 --> 00:06:05,902
♪ Put up the tree before my
spirit falls again! ♪

133
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:08,521
♪ Fill up the stocking. ♪

134
00:06:08,606 --> 00:06:13,776
♪ I may be rushing things,
but deck the halls again now... ♪

135
00:06:13,844 --> 00:06:16,513
- You suck!
- Who goes caroling with a band?

136
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,114
I'd seriously rather be learning.

137
00:06:18,182 --> 00:06:20,583
♪ For we need a little Christmas... ♪

138
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:22,785
You're making me hate Christmas!
♪ Right this very minute... ♪

♪ Candles in the wind... ♪

140
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:26,623
(music stops)
GIRL: Yeah, that's right, leave!

141
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,759
- You suck! I hate you!
- FINN: Go, go, go!

142
00:06:29,827 --> 00:06:31,561
RACHEL: I can't believe
that that teacher

143
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:33,429
let those students speak
to us like that.

144
00:06:33,497 --> 00:06:34,697
I can't believe she
threw her shoe at us.

145
00:06:34,765 --> 00:06:36,566
I guess we're done caroling.

146
00:06:36,634 --> 00:06:38,067
No, we're not, guys.

147
00:06:38,135 --> 00:06:40,770
We can't let what just happened
ruin our Christmas spirit.

148
00:06:40,838 --> 00:06:44,140
Mr. Shue got us this beautiful
tree to inspire us.

149
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:47,310
We're gonna practice now, and
gear up for round two tomorrow.

150
00:06:47,378 --> 00:06:49,179
Pretty soon,
no one will bully us.

151
00:06:49,246 --> 00:06:52,015
Santa Claus can do anything,
and this year,

152
00:06:52,082 --> 00:06:54,651
I asked for the Glee Club to
stop getting picked on.

153
00:06:54,718 --> 00:06:55,702
She's kidding, right?

154
00:06:55,786 --> 00:06:58,154
Guys, this is serious.
Listen up.

155
00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:03,226
Brittany still believes
in Santa Claus.

156
00:07:03,294 --> 00:07:05,128
(stifled laughter)

157
00:07:05,196 --> 00:07:07,830
- You cannot be serious.
- Last week, Brittany believed a comb had magic powers.

158
00:07:07,898 --> 00:07:11,434
- This is kind of a pattern.
- QUINN: She's gonna find out sooner or later.

159
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:12,969
Would you mind, um...

160
00:07:13,037 --> 00:07:15,705
- meeting me at the auditorium tomorrow at 4:00?
- Sure.

161
00:07:15,773 --> 00:07:18,441
- Okay, somebody needs to break the news to her.
- Uh-uh. Don't look at me.

162
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:20,343
I mean, I'm cruel and all,
but that's just hardcore.

163
00:07:20,411 --> 00:07:22,679
Right! That's my point!
Hear me out.

164
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:25,381
Remember when you were a kid,
how excited you would get

165
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:26,950
when you would think
about Santa Claus?

166
00:07:27,017 --> 00:07:28,751
How awesome it was?

167
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:30,386
Christmas was the highlight
of the year.

168
00:07:30,454 --> 00:07:32,188
Why wouldn't you want to keep
someone's world

169
00:07:32,256 --> 00:07:34,490
magical for a little while
longer?

170
00:07:34,558 --> 00:07:38,194
- How?
- I've got it all figured out.

171
00:07:44,516 --> 00:07:46,200
Can I be honest?

172
00:07:46,285 --> 00:07:49,554
I don't understand the difference
between an elf and a slave.

173
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:51,322
(shouting)

174
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,823
I'm not sitting
on that guy's lap.

175
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:56,727
Santas' laps are always
really warm, and it's creepy.

176
00:07:56,795 --> 00:07:59,163
We all have to sit on Santa's lap.
If Brittany sees that we

177
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,365
all still believe, it will make
her strong enough to withstand

178
00:08:01,433 --> 00:08:02,900
all the Santa naysayers
in the world.

179
00:08:02,968 --> 00:08:05,002
Which is everyone
over the age of six.

180
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,305
I'm pretty sure
this isn't going to work.

181
00:08:07,372 --> 00:08:08,606
That guy doesn't
even look like Santa.

182
00:08:08,673 --> 00:08:11,442
Trust me, all Brittany's gonna
see is the suit.

183
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,743
She wants to believe in him.

184
00:08:12,811 --> 00:08:15,513
Mercedes, get up there.

185
00:08:15,581 --> 00:08:17,448
Go, Mercedes, go, Mercedes, go.

186
00:08:17,515 --> 00:08:18,950
MERCEDES:
I've been a very good girl, Santa.

187
00:08:19,017 --> 00:08:23,571
I want a pony, and a doll
that laughs and cries and...

188
00:08:23,655 --> 00:08:26,490
(sniffs)
One of us smells like McDonalds.

189
00:08:26,558 --> 00:08:29,710
I would like Puckerman to
love me. He's a fox.

190
00:08:29,795 --> 00:08:31,913
I would also like
sweet potato fries.

191
00:08:31,997 --> 00:08:33,764
I want bling. I can't be any
more specific than that.

192
00:08:33,832 --> 00:08:35,132
Okay, wait, hold up.

193
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,885
Please tell me that is a roll
of Certs in your pocket.

194
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,637
Do you have anything
for stretch marks?

195
00:08:39,704 --> 00:08:40,938
ChapStick. Lots of ChapStick.

196
00:08:41,006 --> 00:08:43,541
I want Channing Tatum
to stop being in stuff.

197
00:08:43,609 --> 00:08:45,042
When does Asian Santa arrive?

198
00:08:45,053 --> 00:08:45,992
Next.

199
00:08:47,512 --> 00:08:49,847
Just know, you have rights.

200
00:08:49,915 --> 00:08:50,932
SANTA:
Ho, ho, ho!

201
00:08:53,185 --> 00:08:55,586
- What's your name?
- Brittany.

202
00:08:55,654 --> 00:08:57,488
You've gotten really tan.

203
00:08:57,556 --> 00:09:00,424
That's because at the North Pole
there's a hole in the ozone.

204
00:09:00,492 --> 00:09:02,426
(laughs)
You're amazing.

205
00:09:02,494 --> 00:09:04,462
I know you're really busy,

206
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:07,665
so I only want one
thing for Christmas.

207
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:10,968
Do you see my
boyfriend over there?

208
00:09:11,036 --> 00:09:14,906
For Christmas, I want
him to be able to walk.

209
00:09:16,141 --> 00:09:17,508
You can do that,
can't you, Santa?

210
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:25,983
Sure... I'm on it.

211
00:09:26,051 --> 00:09:29,253
- Thank you so much, Santa.
- Now we're screwed.

212
00:09:33,642 --> 00:09:36,460
Now, remember,
it has to be lush and romantic.

213
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:38,229
Why?

214
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,832
Because I am very specific
when I give a gift.

215
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,401
You don't know how many kittens

216
00:09:43,468 --> 00:09:46,203
I've given away because they
haven't been just right.

217
00:09:46,271 --> 00:09:49,373
So, do you like my
winter wonderland?

218
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:52,043
Well, I don't really like
artificial Christmas trees.

219
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,477
I like real ones.

220
00:09:53,545 --> 00:09:55,513
They smell amazing.
That's kind of the whole point.

221
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,416
Right.

222
00:09:58,483 --> 00:09:59,917
Anyway...

223
00:10:03,621 --> 00:10:05,022
Merry Christmas.

224
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:08,092
Being a Jew, I generally
don't give Christmas gifts,

225
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,177
but considering how much you
care about the holiday

226
00:10:10,262 --> 00:10:13,631
I figured I'd
make an exception.

227
00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:15,933
Just... Read it.
It's a note.

228
00:10:16,001 --> 00:10:17,969
"The bearer of this note is
entitled to one song

229
00:10:18,036 --> 00:10:21,138
of Rachel Berry's choosing,
sung to him or her with love."

230
00:10:21,206 --> 00:10:23,441
At least it's not a kitten.

231
00:10:23,508 --> 00:10:25,192
- Come sit.
- I... I don't think so.

232
00:10:25,277 --> 00:10:28,312
I know what you're trying to do,
and it's not going to work.

233
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,314
Look, not letting me apologize
isn't fair.

234
00:10:30,382 --> 00:10:33,017
I've let you apologize
plenty, and I know

235
00:10:33,085 --> 00:10:35,186
that Christmas is supposed to
be about forgiveness but...

236
00:10:35,253 --> 00:10:38,089
I'm not ready to forgive you,
so please stop trying to make me.

237
00:10:42,561 --> 00:10:48,132
- Should we, like, leave?
- No.

238
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,835
Whether it's a heart attack or
heartbreak,

239
00:10:51,887 --> 00:10:56,007
just like on Broadway,
the show must go on.

240
00:10:56,074 --> 00:10:59,610

Hey.

272
00:13:39,304 --> 00:13:40,838
You scared me.

273
00:13:40,906 --> 00:13:43,541
Good. Because I'm
actually Marley's ghost, and

274
00:13:43,608 --> 00:13:46,009
(whispers):
I'm here to tell you

275
00:13:46,061 --> 00:13:48,012
to stop studying so hard.

276
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,647
KURT:
Hmm. What's with the boom box?

277
00:13:49,714 --> 00:13:52,049
I need you to sing with me.
Well, rehearse with me.

278
00:13:52,117 --> 00:13:54,451
I got a gig singing
"Baby, It's Cold Outside"

279
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:56,287
in the King's Island
Christmas Spectacular.

280
00:13:56,354 --> 00:13:58,055
Ah, a personal favorite.

281
00:13:58,123 --> 00:14:00,758
Too bad they'd never
let us sing it together.

282
00:14:00,825 --> 00:14:03,561
I mean, as two... artists.

283
00:14:03,628 --> 00:14:06,430
Mmm. So you going to
help me out here?

284
00:14:06,498 --> 00:14:08,299
Anything to get me to stop
reading about Charlemagne.

285
00:14:08,366 --> 00:14:10,100

Mr. Schuester.

00:16:40,385 --> 00:16:41,785
No, just a friend.

341
00:16:41,853 --> 00:16:44,021
But on the upside,
I am in love with him,

342
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:46,056
and he's actually gay.
I call that progress.

343
00:16:46,124 --> 00:16:48,592
(sighs)
How you doing?

344
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,594
Classes are harder,
but the kids are kinder.

345
00:16:50,662 --> 00:16:52,496
But I miss you guys a lot,
though.

346
00:16:52,564 --> 00:16:53,997
So what brings you here?

347
00:16:54,065 --> 00:16:55,766
Are you looking
for teaching at a place

348
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:57,534
where pencils aren't
primarily used as weapons?

349
00:16:57,602 --> 00:17:00,871
Actually, I need
some holiday help.

350
00:17:00,939 --> 00:17:03,073
I don't know if you know this,

351
00:17:03,141 --> 00:17:05,943
but I am really bad
at Christmas shopping.

352
00:17:09,347 --> 00:17:11,081
Oh, honey,
just what I wanted.

353
00:17:11,149 --> 00:17:13,550
Jumper cables.

354
00:17:13,618 --> 00:17:16,553
This year, I drew Sue
in the office pool Secret Santa.

355
00:17:16,621 --> 00:17:19,790
And I tell you,
I can't think of anything good.

356
00:17:19,858 --> 00:17:21,225
And you are so great
at shopping,

357
00:17:21,292 --> 00:17:23,861
- I thought I'd...
- I have the perfect idea.

358
00:17:23,928 --> 00:17:25,729
(school bell ringing)

359
00:17:25,797 --> 00:17:28,165
I think I can tell
who wrapped that.

360
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:29,333
Who's it for?

361
00:17:29,401 --> 00:17:30,601
Oh, Sue.

362
00:17:30,668 --> 00:17:32,870
I drew her as my Secret Santa.

363
00:17:32,937 --> 00:17:35,139
Wait a minute.
That's not possible.

364
00:17:35,206 --> 00:17:39,343
- Sue's my Secret Santa.
- No, Sue's my Secret Santa.

365
00:17:39,411 --> 00:17:42,146
I'm everybody's Secret Santa.

366
00:17:42,213 --> 00:17:43,947
Yeah, you can just
drop those wherever.

367
00:17:44,015 --> 00:17:45,649
You rigged Secret Santa?

368
00:17:45,717 --> 00:17:47,418
How? It was my idea.

369
00:17:47,485 --> 00:17:49,319
Well, you're not the only person
at this school

370
00:17:49,387 --> 00:17:51,054
who consumes protein powder
by the tubful.

371
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,725
<i>Remember when I told you
I was taking</i>

372
00:17:54,793 --> 00:17:57,828
<i>all those science textbooks
to an exorcist?</i>

373
00:17:57,896 --> 00:17:59,997
<i>Well, that's what we call
a diversion.</i>

374
00:18:04,502 --> 00:18:06,737
You filled your tub
with your name only.

375
00:18:06,805 --> 00:18:07,905
You're a regular
Agatha Christie,

376
00:18:07,972 --> 00:18:09,940
except even more sexless.

377
00:18:10,008 --> 00:18:13,877
See, people, I hate Christmas,
but I love presents.

378
00:18:13,945 --> 00:18:14,912
Ah, look at this.

379
00:18:14,979 --> 00:18:16,413
It's a track suit

380
00:18:16,481 --> 00:18:18,482
with a fur-lined hood
for the winter months.

381
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,683
Thanks, fella.

382
00:18:19,751 --> 00:18:20,684
That was Kurt's idea.

383
00:18:20,752 --> 00:18:21,785
Ah-ah-ah, William.

384
00:18:21,853 --> 00:18:23,120
These gifts are legally mine.

385
00:18:23,188 --> 00:18:25,189
Now, you may or may
not be aware of this,

386
00:18:25,256 --> 00:18:27,290
but I'm an honorary officer
of the Lima Police Department,

387
00:18:27,342 --> 00:18:29,343
and if you take my property
out of my office,

388
00:18:29,427 --> 00:18:31,695
I will pick up that phone and
have you arrested for theft.

389
00:18:31,763 --> 00:18:34,164
We are not going to let you
steal Christmas, Sue.

390
00:18:34,232 --> 00:18:36,467
- You're not going to get away with this.
- I think I already have.

391
00:18:36,534 --> 00:18:39,036
William, Elmo, you,

392
00:18:39,103 --> 00:18:40,704
get the hell out of my office.

393
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:45,242
I just got to say, this
is a really expensive blender.

394
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,311
It's top of the line.

395
00:18:55,753 --> 00:18:57,120
(school bell ringing)

396
00:18:57,188 --> 00:18:58,322
At ease, Becky.

397
00:18:59,728 --> 00:19:01,663
(school bell ringing)

398
00:19:05,234 --> 00:19:07,435
I'm gonna stop you right here.
Why are you wearing that hat?

399
00:19:07,503 --> 00:19:08,837
Because it's Christmas
and it's fun.

400
00:19:08,904 --> 00:19:10,505
No, it's offensive.
You're wearing a Santa Claus hat,

401
00:19:10,573 --> 00:19:12,407
and yet you're handing me
no gifts. I need gifts.

402
00:19:12,474 --> 00:19:13,942
- You want my hat?
- It's a start.

403
00:19:16,445 --> 00:19:17,445
Coach, we've got a problem.

404
00:19:19,081 --> 00:19:20,215
WILL:
Thanks, guys.

405
00:19:20,282 --> 00:19:22,383
Those go under the tree
in the choir room.

406
00:19:22,451 --> 00:19:24,586
Plop it down there.
Thank you.

407
00:19:24,653 --> 00:19:26,054
Can you believe it?

408
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:28,690
Six different people
got Sue a Shake Weight.

409
00:19:28,757 --> 00:19:30,892
Mmm.

410
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,660
Becky, go into the glove box
of my LeCar

411
00:19:32,728 --> 00:19:35,797
and bring me my tear gas.
Then, get me Gloria Allred.

412
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:38,566
Merry Christmas, Sue.

413
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:40,401
As you can see, we're
repo'ing your gifts.

414
00:19:40,469 --> 00:19:42,537
Most can't be returned

415
00:19:42,605 --> 00:19:44,706
since you inexplicably opened
all of them.

416
00:19:44,773 --> 00:19:46,674
And I licked each one
so no one would touch them.

417
00:19:46,742 --> 00:19:48,176
So the staff has
agreed to donate them

418
00:19:48,244 --> 00:19:50,311
to the homeless kids
at McKinney-Vento.

419
00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:51,779
I mean, what is your
problem anyway?

420
00:19:51,847 --> 00:19:53,381
Were you one
of those kids

421
00:19:53,449 --> 00:19:54,749
who never got presents
at Christmas?

422
00:19:54,817 --> 00:19:57,051
Yes, Dr. Laura.
As a matter of fact, I was,

423
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:58,686
and I'm making up for it now.

424
00:19:58,754 --> 00:20:00,221
Face it, Sue. We won.

425
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:02,357
This will not stand.

426
00:20:02,424 --> 00:20:04,993
I have legal rights
to those gifts.

427
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,427
You know what, Sue?
You don't.

428
00:20:06,495 --> 00:20:07,862
I checked with
Human Resources,

429
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,564
and because you
misrepresented yourself,

430
00:20:09,632 --> 00:20:12,367
it is within our legal right
to take back these gifts.

431
00:20:12,434 --> 00:20:14,702
Ho, ho, ho.

432
00:20:15,871 --> 00:20:17,038
(Beiste chuckling)

433
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,609
You know what you are, Sue?

434
00:20:21,677 --> 00:20:22,710
You're a grinch.

435
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,417
Are you guys punking me?

436
00:20:29,485 --> 00:20:31,419
I thought we were cool after
you sang me that song.

437
00:20:31,487 --> 00:20:33,154
This is serious, Coach.

438
00:20:33,222 --> 00:20:35,390
Remember when you were a kid,
the way you felt

439
00:20:35,457 --> 00:20:37,025
when you came downstairs
on Christmas morning,

440
00:20:37,092 --> 00:20:38,426
seeing that Santa had come?

441
00:20:38,494 --> 00:20:40,228
I do love Santa Claus.

442
00:20:40,296 --> 00:20:42,830
One year, I asked him
for a full set of free weights.

443
00:20:42,898 --> 00:20:45,300
Kept asking my dad,
"How did Santy get

444
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:46,801
those 75-pound dumbbells
down the chimney?"

445
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:48,903
Should have suspected something

446
00:20:48,971 --> 00:20:51,105
when Dad was in traction
until the end of January.

447
00:20:51,173 --> 00:20:52,840
You've got the perfect
Santa body type.

448
00:20:52,908 --> 00:20:53,908
Watch it, Puckerman.

449
00:20:53,976 --> 00:20:55,443
Look, we rented the suit.

450
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:56,644
All you need to do
is put it on.

451
00:20:56,712 --> 00:20:58,579
Just tell her
that you can't give her

452
00:20:58,647 --> 00:21:00,081
the gift of me
walking this year.

453
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:02,116
That seems so harsh
and not at all like Santa.

454
00:21:02,184 --> 00:21:03,635
She asked Santa
for the impossible:

455
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:05,119
Me walking again.

456
00:21:05,187 --> 00:21:07,055
If Christmas morning
comes around and I'm not

457
00:21:07,122 --> 00:21:09,891
dancing in Glee Club rehearsal
with no personal explanation

458
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:12,226
from her idol, she's going
to lose faith in Old Saint Nick,

459
00:21:12,294 --> 00:21:13,628
and we can't have that.

460
00:21:13,696 --> 00:21:15,063
Tell her the elves
are working on it.

461
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,865
Elves have awesome cord blood
for stem cell research,

462
00:21:17,933 --> 00:21:20,101
but these advances
are a few years away.

463
00:21:21,303 --> 00:21:22,704
Okay.

464
00:21:22,771 --> 00:21:25,039
Great. And then we need you
to break into her house.

465
00:21:25,107 --> 00:21:26,908
- What? No, no way!
- The back door will be open.

466
00:21:26,976 --> 00:21:30,745
I talked to her parents. They
really want her to believe, too.

467
00:21:30,813 --> 00:21:32,813
(school bell ringing)

468
00:21:32,865 --> 00:21:34,382
BECKY:
Look, Coach.

469
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,751
The janitor staff
got you hideous gloves.

470
00:21:36,818 --> 00:21:38,219
SUE:
Give me those.

471
00:21:38,287 --> 00:21:39,587
They'll come in handy.

472
00:21:39,655 --> 00:21:41,356
No fingerprints.

473
00:21:41,423 --> 00:21:43,558
Suit up, Becky.

474
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:47,295
I don't understand
why we have to dress up, Coach.

475
00:21:47,346 --> 00:21:50,465
Well, this way,
if anyone sees us,

476
00:21:50,532 --> 00:21:53,134
we'll have plausible
deniability.

477
00:21:53,202 --> 00:21:55,236
I repeat, you are a "rein-dog."

478
00:21:55,304 --> 00:21:57,138
Trust me, they're real.

479
00:21:57,206 --> 00:21:58,106
How am I looking?

480
00:21:58,173 --> 00:21:59,140
Fantastic, Coach.

481
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:01,042
Yeah, you know, Becky,

482
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,177
my mastery of camouflage
is the only thing

483
00:22:03,245 --> 00:22:04,862
that kept me
from being court-martialed

484
00:22:04,947 --> 00:22:06,981
after that My Lai
misunderstanding.

485
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:08,282
Copy that.

486
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,818
Now, let's go get
what is rightfully mine.

487
00:22:10,886 --> 00:22:12,553
Schuester thinks I'm a grinch,

488
00:22:12,621 --> 00:22:14,188
well, that's exactly
what he's gonna get.

489
00:22:14,256 --> 00:22:16,124
("You're A Mean One, Mr. Grinch"
playing)

490
00:22:16,191 --> 00:22:17,458

Santa?

507
00:23:35,871 --> 00:23:38,439
Why, Brittany.

508
00:23:38,507 --> 00:23:40,775
What are you doing here?

509
00:23:40,843 --> 00:23:44,378
I'm bringing a gift to put under
the tree for the homeless kids.

510
00:23:44,446 --> 00:23:45,813
It's a dollhouse.

511
00:23:45,881 --> 00:23:47,248
At least their dolls
won't be homeless.

512
00:23:48,317 --> 00:23:50,284
What are you doing, Santa?

513
00:23:50,352 --> 00:23:53,254
Well, you see, Brittany,
uh, one of the lights

514
00:23:53,305 --> 00:23:54,822
on the tree
isn't working.

515
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:57,658
So I'm bringing it back
home to my workshop.

516
00:23:57,726 --> 00:24:00,728
I'll fix it up there,
and I'll bring it back here.

517
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:02,497
Oh.

518
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,968
Shuffle on home.

519
00:24:11,807 --> 00:24:13,641
(wheels squeaking)

520
00:24:26,814 --> 00:24:28,064
(school bell ringing)

521
00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:29,983
(whistling)

522
00:24:32,987 --> 00:24:34,287
They took everything.

523
00:24:34,355 --> 00:24:35,689
Including all of Sue's
Secret Santa gifts

524
00:24:35,756 --> 00:24:37,123
we were gonna give
to the homeless kids.

525
00:24:37,191 --> 00:24:38,625
RACHEL:
Only further proof

526
00:24:38,693 --> 00:24:40,427
that everyone in this school
hates us no matter what we do.

527
00:24:40,495 --> 00:24:42,028
It's not the school.

528
00:24:42,096 --> 00:24:43,363
It's Sue.
She did this.

529
00:24:43,431 --> 00:24:45,065
It wasn't Sue, it was Santa.

530
00:24:45,132 --> 00:24:46,933
He said a light was out on
the tree, he'd fix everything.

531
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:48,168
We just need to let him
do his thing.

532
00:24:50,588 --> 00:24:53,673
Okay.

533
00:24:53,741 --> 00:24:55,008
Are you sure

534
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,877
Santa was a boy
and not a girl, Brittany?

535
00:24:56,944 --> 00:24:58,061
I swear on my life.

536
00:24:58,145 --> 00:24:59,513
Santa's a boy.
Everybody knows that.

537
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,047
It was probably one of the boys
on the football team.

538
00:25:03,217 --> 00:25:05,018
I guess it wasn't Sue.

539
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,486
So our tree is gone.

540
00:25:06,554 --> 00:25:08,088
So our presents are missing.

541
00:25:08,155 --> 00:25:10,323
Santa's probably fixing any
dents or chips as we speak.

542
00:25:10,391 --> 00:25:13,093
FINN:
All around the world today,

543
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,128
way worse things have happened
to people than this.

544
00:25:15,196 --> 00:25:17,497
Sorry, but I'm not going
to let this get us down.

545
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:20,233
'Tis the season.

546
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:22,202
I agree. Come on, guys,
let's clean this up.

547
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:27,073
Come on.
(claps)

548
00:25:27,124 --> 00:25:28,842
Finn.

549
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:30,844
You and I are
the leaders of this club.

550
00:25:30,912 --> 00:25:32,946
All right,
we need to fix this.

551
00:25:33,014 --> 00:25:34,948
We have to put everything
that's happened behind us

552
00:25:35,016 --> 00:25:37,934
and save Christmas
for the Glee Club.

553
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:40,253
I want to make this right.

554
00:25:40,321 --> 00:25:42,923
(school bell ringing)

555
00:25:47,261 --> 00:25:49,279
You smell kind of funny.

556
00:25:49,363 --> 00:25:51,298
Oh, I, um,

557
00:25:51,365 --> 00:25:53,283
I put this on
for the car ride over.

558
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:55,635
I know how much you love
the smell of Christmas pine.

559
00:25:55,703 --> 00:25:57,637
But guess I don't
really need it

560
00:25:57,705 --> 00:25:59,773
now that we have the real thing.

561
00:26:01,609 --> 00:26:03,476
It's so cold out.

562
00:26:03,544 --> 00:26:05,412
It's cuddle weather.

563
00:26:05,479 --> 00:26:08,415
It's unseasonably warm, actually,
for this time of year, but, uh...

564
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:11,351
I just, I really wanted
to come here with you.

565
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:14,154
I mean, the Christmas tree is
the foundation of Christmas.

566
00:26:14,221 --> 00:26:16,089
It's the hearth of
the Christmas home.

567
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:18,558
Without it, there wouldn't be
anywhere to hang the ornaments

568
00:26:18,626 --> 00:26:20,560
or put the presents under.

569
00:26:20,628 --> 00:26:21,561
Yeah, yeah.

570
00:26:21,629 --> 00:26:22,896
Whenever we put the tree up,

571
00:26:22,964 --> 00:26:24,164
I always knew
Christmas was really here.

572
00:26:24,231 --> 00:26:27,100
This one's too small.

573
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,568
- But, uh...
- Oh, I love this song.

574
00:26:28,636 --> 00:26:29,986
It's, uh, it's my
favorite Christmas song.

575
00:26:30,071 --> 00:26:31,004
It's Wham!

576
00:26:31,072 --> 00:26:32,522
Yeah, yeah.

577
00:26:32,607 --> 00:26:33,573
Cool.

578
00:26:33,641 --> 00:26:35,108
Um...

579
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,977
I'm going to look down
this row of Frasier firs.

580
00:26:37,044 --> 00:26:38,912
Maybe you could
check out the Douglases

581
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,614
and I'll meet you at the end.

582
00:26:40,681 --> 00:26:42,716
Okay.

583
00:26:42,783 --> 00:26:45,085

Last year, for Christmas,

610
00:28:28,355 --> 00:28:29,789
I asked Santa to give me you.

611
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:38,932
It's not last year anymore.

612
00:28:38,999 --> 00:28:40,767
It's Christmas, Finn.
It's time for you to forgive me.

613
00:28:40,818 --> 00:28:41,868
No, I can't.

614
00:28:43,237 --> 00:28:44,437
Okay, this is wrong.
I shouldn't...

615
00:28:44,505 --> 00:28:45,538
I shouldn't have
brought you here.

616
00:28:47,274 --> 00:28:48,608
You messed me up, Rachel.

617
00:28:48,676 --> 00:28:52,378
Can't you see
how screwed-up I am about this?

618
00:28:52,446 --> 00:28:54,914
I've had two girlfriends, and
both of them have cheated on me.

619
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:00,887
Maybe you can ask Santa again
for me next year.

620
00:29:00,955 --> 00:29:02,722
I'm officially
breaking up with you.

621
00:29:13,138 --> 00:29:14,372
This was my dad's.

622
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,375
He'd want you to do it.
For those kids.

623
00:29:20,346 --> 00:29:22,814
This was my uncle's.

624
00:29:22,881 --> 00:29:25,383
It's the first thing
I ever stole, actually.

625
00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:28,119
I'm going to look terrible.

626
00:29:28,187 --> 00:29:29,420
Shut up.
With your bone structure,

627
00:29:29,488 --> 00:29:30,772
you could rock
the <i>Rosemary's Baby</i> look

628
00:29:30,856 --> 00:29:32,557
and still look good.

629
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:34,025
I'm going to look
like Jackie Chan.

630
00:29:34,093 --> 00:29:36,027
If Barbra can pull off a bob,
so can I.

631
00:29:36,095 --> 00:29:37,261
Enough yapping, let's do this.

632
00:29:37,329 --> 00:29:38,796
Whoa! Whoa!
What are you guys doing?

633
00:29:38,864 --> 00:29:40,765
We're going all "Gift of
the Magi" to raise money

634
00:29:40,833 --> 00:29:42,800
to buy homeless kids
those school supplies.

635
00:29:42,868 --> 00:29:44,636
The guys are gonna
sell their watches

636
00:29:44,703 --> 00:29:46,571
and the girls are gonna
sell off their hair.

637
00:29:46,639 --> 00:29:48,206
- You can't do that.
- Oh, no, it's cool.

638
00:29:48,273 --> 00:29:49,374
Most of this isn't mine,
anyways.

639
00:29:49,441 --> 00:29:50,875
No, I mean,
that's not the answer.

640
00:29:50,943 --> 00:29:53,044
There are other ways to raise
money at Christmastime.

641
00:29:53,112 --> 00:29:55,079
No, but we tried caroling,
and it didn't work.

642
00:29:55,147 --> 00:29:57,548
Wait, I thought you and Finn
were getting us a new tree.

643
00:29:57,616 --> 00:30:00,685
We went, but Finn bailed
before we could get one.

644
00:30:00,753 --> 00:30:02,553
Nice Christmas spirit, Finn.

645
00:30:02,621 --> 00:30:03,321
WILL:
Wait!

646
00:30:03,389 --> 00:30:05,189
Guys, no more fighting.

647
00:30:05,257 --> 00:30:06,691
(sighs)

648
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:09,193
Have any of you ever actually
read "Gift of the Magi"?

649
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,531
None of you?

650
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:15,099
You don't have to read
"Gift of the Magi."

651
00:30:15,167 --> 00:30:16,100
everybody knows what it's about.

652
00:30:16,168 --> 00:30:18,102
Well, if you actually read it,

653
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:19,637
you'd know what it's about.

654
00:30:19,705 --> 00:30:22,173
Yeah, I know what it's about:
Life freakin' sucks.

655
00:30:22,241 --> 00:30:23,607
Actually, you're right.

656
00:30:26,245 --> 00:30:27,478
The first Christmas
you remember having

657
00:30:27,546 --> 00:30:29,047
is the greatest day
of your life.

658
00:30:29,114 --> 00:30:30,515
Your family's all together,

659
00:30:30,582 --> 00:30:32,350
there are loads
of presents, cookies.

660
00:30:32,418 --> 00:30:33,885
The magic is
alive and well.

661
00:30:33,952 --> 00:30:37,822
But before you know it,
you grow up.

662
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:40,258
Work and school
and girlfriends take over

663
00:30:40,325 --> 00:30:42,293
and Christmas becomes
more of an obligation,

664
00:30:42,361 --> 00:30:45,830
a reminder of what's lost
instead of what's possible.

665
00:30:45,898 --> 00:30:47,932
And all of the trees
and the presents

666
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,967
and even the mistletoe
can't change that.

667
00:30:50,035 --> 00:30:53,571
And then when
you get to my age...

668
00:30:53,639 --> 00:30:58,042
you're so desperate
to get that magic back,

669
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,177
you'd do anything

670
00:30:59,244 --> 00:31:00,845
to be able to feel

671
00:31:00,913 --> 00:31:04,182
how you did
that first Christmas.

672
00:31:04,249 --> 00:31:05,116
So what should we do?

673
00:31:07,052 --> 00:31:10,988
Put your scissors down,
put your watches back on.

674
00:31:11,056 --> 00:31:12,724
We're gonna go out
and find some people

675
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:14,392
who really need
some Christmas spirit,

676
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,994
and we are gonna sing for them.

677
00:31:17,062 --> 00:31:20,882
Get a good night's rest, Ken,
you're gonna need it.

678
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:23,501
Barbie took the early flight
from Tampa.

679
00:31:23,569 --> 00:31:24,502
(clattering)

680
00:31:32,644 --> 00:31:34,345
Santa?

681
00:31:36,048 --> 00:31:37,782
But it's too early.

682
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:41,018
Well, you know what they say.

683
00:31:41,086 --> 00:31:43,121
Early's late if you make
tomorrow yesterday.

684
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,224
Awesome.

685
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:48,376
You know, Brittany,

686
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,963
I was in the neighborhood,
doing a dry run.

687
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:54,265
I have so many houses to
visit on Christmas Eve,

688
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:56,334
I got to make sure it
goes off without a hitch.

689
00:31:56,401 --> 00:31:58,402
How about you come
sit with ol' Santy?

690
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:00,371
(chuckles):
Okay!

691
00:32:00,422 --> 00:32:03,141
How about you sit next
to Santy instead?

692
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:04,408
Santy's just a little stinky.

693
00:32:04,476 --> 00:32:06,144
(laughs)
He needs a good ol'

694
00:32:06,211 --> 00:32:07,278
sponge bath from Mrs. Claus.

695
00:32:07,346 --> 00:32:08,212
(chuckles)

696
00:32:11,183 --> 00:32:14,018
Brittany, do you remember what
you asked me for for Christmas?

697
00:32:14,086 --> 00:32:16,654
Yeah, I asked for Artie
to be able to walk.

698
00:32:19,892 --> 00:32:21,993
Is there anything else
that you want?

699
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,994
I mean, like, anything?

700
00:32:23,061 --> 00:32:24,428
No.

701
00:32:24,496 --> 00:32:27,665
Well, see,
Santa's trying his best,

702
00:32:27,733 --> 00:32:29,967
but that one's
a little hard.

703
00:32:30,035 --> 00:32:32,537
But you're magic.

704
00:32:32,604 --> 00:32:34,472
Sometimes what Santa
wants to give

705
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,607
a good girl like you is patience,

706
00:32:36,675 --> 00:32:38,109
because, believe it or not,

707
00:32:38,177 --> 00:32:39,844
there are even some things
that he can't manage.

708
00:32:39,912 --> 00:32:41,646
You know,

709
00:32:41,713 --> 00:32:44,582
there was a girl
a little younger than you

710
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:46,217
and she was a little husky.

711
00:32:46,285 --> 00:32:48,786
She was always asking
Santy for the same thing:

712
00:32:48,854 --> 00:32:52,790
To make her look
more like the other girls.

713
00:32:52,858 --> 00:32:55,726
She wasn't asking to be
pretty or nothing.

714
00:32:55,794 --> 00:32:58,095
But she just didn't want
to stick out so much.

715
00:32:59,865 --> 00:33:03,734
Santa just couldn't do it.

716
00:33:03,802 --> 00:33:07,705
So instead Santa
gave her patience.

717
00:33:07,773 --> 00:33:09,373
And later on, that girl was...

718
00:33:09,441 --> 00:33:13,811
Was glad that Santy didn't give
her what she had asked him for.

719
00:33:13,879 --> 00:33:17,648
She... She put being
husky to good use.

720
00:33:17,716 --> 00:33:20,117
Was her name Ricki Lake?

721
00:33:20,185 --> 00:33:22,620
(sighs)
The point is...

722
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:25,523
I don't think I'm going
to be able to give you

723
00:33:25,591 --> 00:33:27,925
what you're asking for,
even though I'd like to.

724
00:33:27,993 --> 00:33:30,294
- But, Santa...
- I'm sorry, pumpkin.

725
00:33:30,362 --> 00:33:32,363
It's... It's just not
going to happen.

726
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,101
Aren't you going
to go up the chimney?

727
00:33:39,304 --> 00:33:42,940
On dry runs,
Santy uses the Isuzu.

728
00:33:54,787 --> 00:33:56,338
(school bell ringing)

729
00:33:59,474 --> 00:34:00,708
What's going on?

730
00:34:00,776 --> 00:34:03,377
I think I've lost
the Christmas spirit.

731
00:34:05,547 --> 00:34:07,148
It's Santa.

732
00:34:07,215 --> 00:34:08,983
I don't know if
I can tell you.

733
00:34:13,555 --> 00:34:15,956
I used to believe that
Santa could do anything.

734
00:34:16,076 --> 00:34:17,596
If Santa isn't magical,

735
00:34:17,716 --> 00:34:20,161
I don't even know if I
want to believe anymore.

736
00:34:20,228 --> 00:34:22,596
It isn't fair that you
can't walk, Artie.

737
00:34:22,664 --> 00:34:24,298
I feel so terrible.

738
00:34:24,366 --> 00:34:29,937
Hey, look at me.
I'm fine.

739
00:34:30,005 --> 00:34:32,707
Hey, guys, we need you
in the teachers' lounge.

740
00:34:32,774 --> 00:34:35,543
Mr. Shue...
Brittany's not feeling so good.

741
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,911
Santa thing.

742
00:34:36,978 --> 00:34:38,612
If you don't mind,
I think I'm going

743
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,481
to take her home,
make sure she's okay.

744
00:34:40,549 --> 00:34:42,416
Good idea. We'll
make do without you.

745
00:34:46,888 --> 00:34:49,190
(school bell ringing)

746
00:34:49,257 --> 00:34:52,226
Hey, uh, so we're your students.

747
00:34:52,294 --> 00:34:55,796
All year long you suffer
through dealing with us.

748
00:34:55,864 --> 00:34:58,566
I imagine having some of us
in your classes

749
00:34:58,633 --> 00:35:01,035
would slowly chip away at
your hopes and dreams,

750
00:35:01,103 --> 00:35:03,137
until the whole world just felt
like a never-ending

751
00:35:03,205 --> 00:35:05,873
- nightmare of pain...
- Just get to the point, Finn.

752
00:35:05,941 --> 00:35:08,509
Right. Uh, anyway,
we're here today

753
00:35:08,577 --> 00:35:09,944
to help raise money

754
00:35:10,011 --> 00:35:12,279
for children that have a lot
less than we do.

755
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:15,349
And I know some of us
have had a hard Christmas,

756
00:35:15,417 --> 00:35:17,918
but what we've come to learn
is that no matter

757
00:35:17,986 --> 00:35:19,353
how tough things get,

758
00:35:19,421 --> 00:35:21,122
there isn't anything
that more Santa

759
00:35:21,189 --> 00:35:23,791
or a couple more jingle bells
can't cure.

760
00:35:23,859 --> 00:35:26,127
SUE:
Well, Becky, we did it.

761
00:35:26,194 --> 00:35:28,996
We got all my presents back.

762
00:35:29,064 --> 00:35:31,065
And as satisfying
as it is to have been

763
00:35:31,133 --> 00:35:33,968
gifted enough rotisserie ovens
to roast an entire hobo...

764
00:35:34,035 --> 00:35:37,438
For me,
the real joy of Christmas

765
00:35:37,506 --> 00:35:39,607
was breaking the collective
heart of the Glee Club.

766
00:35:39,674 --> 00:35:43,611
(gentle melodic music playing)

767
00:35:43,678 --> 00:35:47,348
What's that, Coach?

768
00:35:51,419 --> 00:35:55,355

It's beautiful.

791
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,520
It is.

792
00:37:42,797 --> 00:37:45,649
(school bell ringing)

793
00:37:45,734 --> 00:37:46,867
How much did we raise?

794
00:37:46,935 --> 00:37:48,468
210 bucks.

795
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,870
And that's after my cut.

796
00:37:49,938 --> 00:37:51,171
I'm kidding.

797
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:52,273
Now that you're divorced

798
00:37:52,324 --> 00:37:53,807
and Ms. Pillsbury
married another guy,

799
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:55,709
I guess you'll be spending
Christmas Eve alone.

800
00:37:55,777 --> 00:37:57,144
Yes, Rachel, I am.

801
00:37:57,212 --> 00:37:59,713
Well, I know how painful
being alone can feel,

802
00:37:59,781 --> 00:38:02,182
so if you want,
you can come over to my house.

803
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,184
We're going to eat Chinese
and watch <i>The Main Event</i>.

804
00:38:04,252 --> 00:38:06,670
Thanks, Rachel.
I think I'm going to pass.

805
00:38:06,755 --> 00:38:08,589
Nothing wrong
with being alone.

806
00:38:16,798 --> 00:38:18,599
Artie.

807
00:38:18,667 --> 00:38:19,733
(mechanical whirring)

808
00:38:19,801 --> 00:38:21,535
(gasps)

809
00:38:25,407 --> 00:38:27,775
It's called a ReWalk.

810
00:38:27,842 --> 00:38:30,244
Some guy in Israel
invented it.

811
00:38:30,312 --> 00:38:33,080
I can't use it
all the time, but...

812
00:38:33,148 --> 00:38:34,982
Check me out.

813
00:38:38,353 --> 00:38:40,454
(whirring)

814
00:38:53,068 --> 00:38:55,069
Where did you get it?

815
00:38:55,136 --> 00:38:59,640
BRITTANY: We went home and
it was sitting under my Christmas tree.

816
00:38:59,708 --> 00:39:01,225
How the hell did you
afford that thing?

817
00:39:01,309 --> 00:39:02,176
BRITTANY:
I didn't buy it.

818
00:39:02,243 --> 00:39:03,610
I didn't know what it was.

819
00:39:03,678 --> 00:39:05,245
I thought it was
a Transformer.

820
00:39:05,313 --> 00:39:07,548
I assumed her dad
got it for me,

821
00:39:07,615 --> 00:39:10,184
but he has no idea
where it came from.

822
00:39:10,251 --> 00:39:12,086
He went to take
a long poop, and when

823
00:39:12,153 --> 00:39:13,821
he came back it was there.

824
00:39:13,888 --> 00:39:15,489
So if no one we know
bought it for you, then...

825
00:39:15,557 --> 00:39:17,057
Santa brought it.

826
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,427
Santa.

827
00:39:20,495 --> 00:39:22,363
Santa.

828
00:39:24,933 --> 00:39:26,600
A real Christmas miracle.

829
00:39:30,805 --> 00:39:32,639
(whirring)

830
00:39:47,856 --> 00:39:49,723
(school bell ringing)

831
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:08,409
(fire crackling)

832
00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:19,887
Hey, Will.

833
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:24,358
How...How did you get in here?

834
00:40:24,426 --> 00:40:25,926
Oh, I had a key made
ages ago.

835
00:40:26,995 --> 00:40:28,295
How do you like your tree?

836
00:40:30,365 --> 00:40:32,800
Uh, it's... It's...
It's beautiful.

837
00:40:32,867 --> 00:40:35,335
Wh... What's going on?
What's with all the presents?

838
00:40:35,403 --> 00:40:37,571
Well, you remember that
old meanie who stole

839
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:39,606
all that stuff out
of the choir room?

840
00:40:39,674 --> 00:40:42,476
Well, she's sorry.

841
00:40:42,544 --> 00:40:44,678
Really?

842
00:40:44,746 --> 00:40:47,414
And what made her
change her mind?

843
00:40:47,482 --> 00:40:48,982
I don't know.

844
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,951
Call it a Christmas miracle
and we'll leave it at that.

845
00:40:51,002 --> 00:40:54,621
Now I know a lot of these gifts
are for orphans or something,

846
00:40:54,689 --> 00:40:58,025
but, uh... I got you
something special.

847
00:40:58,093 --> 00:40:59,593
It's okay, it's not
going to explode.

848
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:08,602
I thought you might want to put
all of us out of our misery

849
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,137
and shave off that Chia Pet.

850
00:41:13,341 --> 00:41:15,175
Thanks, Sue.

851
00:41:15,243 --> 00:41:17,111
The tree really does look great.

852
00:41:17,178 --> 00:41:19,313
Well, Santa had some helpers.

853
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,782
(whistle blowing)

854
00:41:24,185 --> 00:41:27,688
No one should be alone
on Christmas Eve, Mr. Schuester.

855
00:41:27,755 --> 00:41:30,057
SUE: Too much talking, lady,
not enough trimming.

856
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:33,026
Come on, let's get some
Christmas up in here.

857
00:41:36,264 --> 00:41:38,432
I thought you
