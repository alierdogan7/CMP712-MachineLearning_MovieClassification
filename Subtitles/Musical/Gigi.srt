00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,768
Do you see that blue flame...

362
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:54,521
...darting about in the depths
of the green light?

363
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,606
Only the most beautiful emeralds...

364
00:21:56,816 --> 00:22:00,151
...contain that miracle
of elusive blue.

365

-Who gave it to you, aunt?
-A king.

366

-A great king?
-No, a little one.

367
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,450
Great kings do not give
very large stones.

368

371

Who? Oh, the shy, the proud...

372
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:21,423
...and the social climbers.
They think it's a sign of culture.

373

But it doesn't matter who gives them...

374
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:27,262

wear anything second-rate.

538
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:22,440
Honoré Lachaille
Honoré Lachaille

539
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,693
With another twinkle in his eye

540
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:29,280
Isn’t it a shame
Isn’t it a crime

541
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:32,033
Seeing him so happy all the time

542
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:46,339
There's Gaston Lachaille
With his little friend

543
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:49,759
Is that passion never going to end?

544
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:53,095
Did you see her ring?
Not a bagatelle

545
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:55,765
Dear Liane is doing very well

546
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:31,175
GASTON [SINGS]:
She's a lovable one tonight, isn't she?

547
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,594
What is she up to?

548
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:37,098
She's so gay tonight

549
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,266
She's like spring tonight

550
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:42,687
She's a rollicking
Frolicking thing tonight

551
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,898
So disarming
Soft and charming

552
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:48,651
She is not thinking of me

553
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:51,946
No, she's not thinking of me

554
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:54,824
In her eyes tonight

555
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:56,617
There's a glow tonight

556
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,995
They're so bright they could light
Fontainebleau tonight

557
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,873
She's so gracious
So vivacious

558
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,168
She is not thinking of me

559
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:08,713
Bless her little heart

560
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:12,383
Crooked to the core

561
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,845
Acting out a part

562
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:20,641
What a rollicking, frolicking bore!

563
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,436
She's such fun tonight

564
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:25,229
She's a treat tonight

565
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:28,941
You could spread her on bread
She's so sweet tonight

566
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,402
So devoted
Sugar-coated

567
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:35,072
That it's heartwarming to see

568
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,783
Oh, she's simmering with love

569
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:39,660
Oh, she's shimmering with love

570
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:42,580
Oh, she's not thinking of me

571
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:02,850
She is not thinking of me

572
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:06,437
Someone has set her on fire

573
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,607
Is it Jacques, is it Paul or Léon?

574
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:13,527
Who's turning her furnace up higher?

575
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:16,906
Oh, she's hot
But it's not for Gaston!

576
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,992
Oh, she's gay tonight

577
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:21,994
Oh, so gay tonight

578
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:25,247
A gigantic, romantic cliché tonight

579
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:28,459
How she blushes
How she gushes

580
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,212
How she fills me with ennui

581
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:34,215
She's so ooh la la la la

582
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:35,925
So untrue la la la la

583
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,886
Oh, she's not thinking of me

584
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,480
GASTON:
I knew she was up to something.

585
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:52,525
I knew it. There had to be
a reason for last night.

586
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,443
But what was I to do?

587
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,279
Trail after her? Spy on her?

588
00:35:57,531 --> 00:36:00,032
-Sniff around like a bloodhound?
HONORÉ: Of course not.

589
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,743
Heaven knows, I'm not jealous.
Thank you for that.

590
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,370
Why should I follow her?

591
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,872
No reason at all. What did you do?

592
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:08,624
I hired detectives.

593
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,252
And the results are nauseating.

594
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:16,173
The Riverton Agency just telephoned me
that she and her oily acrobat...

595
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:21,011
...arrived a half an hour ago
in a cozy little inn at Honfleur.

596
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:22,263
Well.

597
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,764
Without skates.

598
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,599
Most disagreeable.

599
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:28,269
Come, my boy. You're not the first.

600
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,563
This sort of thing has happened before.

601
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:32,314
And to some very good people.

602
00:36:32,566 --> 00:36:35,568
Alfred de Musset, Victor Hugo, Napoleon.

603
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:38,112
Even to me. Isn’t that true, Manuel?

604
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,948
Yes, indeed, sir.
Many, many, many times.

605
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,491
Well, not that many.

606
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,160
But a skating instructor.

607
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,371
A skating instructor!

608
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,832
It is always a skating instructor.

609
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,792
Or some such specimen.

610
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,795
-Isn’t that true, Manuel?
-Absolutely, sir.

611
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,548
Remember dear little
Madame Dumelle...

612
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,509
...and Marmaluc the Terrible Turk?

613
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:01,886
There you are.

614
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,096
A wrestler from the Folies Bergère.

615
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,974
There was Madame Laura
and the swimming coach.

616
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,475
Hurry up, Manuel.

617
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,520
And Madame d'Albert
and the riding master.

618
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:13,314
Mademoiselle Monique
and the weight lifter...

619
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,608
...Madame Bocher and the plumber.

620
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:18,152
That's enough, Manuel.
You've made your point.

621
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,070
Here, put this in your mouth.

622
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:24,325
One can't be a Don Juan
to one's valet, can one?

623
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:28,162
I only keep him to prevent him
from talking to others.

624
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:30,748
Oh, come, Gaston, cheer up.

625
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,668
Cheer up? I couldn't be in better spirits.

626
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:37,421
Good. I'm delighted
the deadly affair is over.

627
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:40,841
The woman was common.
Plainly and unmistakably common...

628
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:44,011
...from her painted toenails
to the top of her bleached head.

629
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,889
I'm glad to be rid of her.
What do we do today?

630
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,100
What do we do?

631
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,853
We're going to Honfleur, naturally.

632
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:55,606
Are you mad?
I never want to see her again.

633
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:57,524
Of course you don't.

634
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:00,694
But you're not going to
let a woman have the last word.

635
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:02,696
Where is your sense of honor?

636
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,615
Your male patriotism?

637
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:05,866
Nonsense.

638
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:09,536
Listen to your uncle, Monsieur Gaston.
He's an old campaigner.

639
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,121
How would you end it?

640
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,207
I'll write her a note.

641
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:19,171
There is no way of writing it
without it reeking of wounded pride.

642
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:21,215
Victor Hugo couldn't pull it off.

643
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,884
Then I'll telephone her.

644
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:25,636
And what will you say?

645
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:29,890
"Liane, you deceived me
with a skating instructor.

646
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,059
I never want to see you again."

647
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:35,813
You'll sound like a jealous schoolboy.

648
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,940
That's impossible.

649
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:39,817
That's true.

650
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,903
That's true. What do I do?

651
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,531
You go to Honfleur
and throw her out like a man.

652
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:47,992
Oh, no, no, no. That's a bore.

653
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,411
A bore? Not at all.

654
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:52,079
It's pride.

655
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:54,581
[SINGS]
Just imagine your chagrin

656
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,500
When she sees you wander in

657
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,919
And you find her
With that slippery señor

658
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:01,296
What a moment supreme

659
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:03,132
When she totters with a scream

660
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,633
-What will she do?
-Scream.

661
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:06,468
-What did yours do?
-Scream.

662
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,554
-What do they all do?
-Scream.

663
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,264
It's a bore

664
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:11,932
But think of the bliss

665
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,600
Of the pleasure you would miss

666
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:15,477
When she topples in a heap

667
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:18,480
And you leave her there to weep
On the floor

668
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:20,315
It's a bore

669
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,359
You must catch her if you can

670
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,028
For the dignity of man

671
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:25,946
Take advantage of the chance

672
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:28,574
You owe it, sir, to France
This is war!

673
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,534
All right

674
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:32,453
But it's a bore

675
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:50,971
Turn it around and leave it there.

676
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:08,489
Gaston!

677
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,159
They are there.

678
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:27,508
Terrible-looking rodent, isn't he?

679
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,718
Terrible, but typical.

680
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:32,096
Those chaps all look alike.

681
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,891
She looks older in the daylight.

682
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:39,394
Much older. I don't envy him.

683
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:40,729
Neither do I.

684
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:44,691
She never kissed me like that.

685
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:47,027
-How is she kissing him?
-Wholeheartedly.

686
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:48,278
What do you expect?

687
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:51,198
You're legitimate.
He's forbidden fruit.

688
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,866
When do we make our move?

689
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:54,159
Wait, wait.

690
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,541
Come on.

691
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:11,844
Monsieur Lachaille, what a surprise.
I am honored.

692
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:13,303
Don't be. Come on, get up!

693
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:16,431
Wait, wait!
You are making a mistake.

694
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:20,060
It was just a coincidence,
my meeting madame here.

695
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,646
Yeah, and it was a coincidence,
I suppose...

696
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,815
...that your lips
just happened to meet...

697
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:26,608
...in a long, ardent, passionate--

698
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,110
You keep out of this.

699
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:31,989
I don't want any discussions.
For 1000 francs, this never happened.

700
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:34,950
You leave the Ice Palace
and disappear. Forever.

701
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,618
-But--
-No "buts."

00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,704
You're coming with us now.

703
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:40,789
We'll take you to
the nearest railroad station.

704
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,249
One thousand francs?

00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,023
Gaston!

706
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,192
Gaston!

707
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,862
There is nothing more to be said.
Goodbye, madame.

708
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:14,990
From the bottom of my heart, goodbye.

709
00:42:18,912 --> 00:42:20,329
Gaston, my love.

889
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:14,649
Now, let's see.

890
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:19,612
Cards are a matter of logic.

891
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:24,492
I know what I have...

892
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,620
...and I know how many you've drawn.

893
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:32,375
According to the percentages,
you undoubtedly have an ace.

894
00:53:33,294 --> 00:53:36,337
You discarded a 10 and a five...

895
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:38,047
...and a queen...

896
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:39,632
...and a three.

897
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:44,220
You, therefore, must have two aces.

898
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:48,057
Two aces and something smaller.

899
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:50,643
That's very interesting.

900
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:54,731
Therefore...

901
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:56,983
...I win.

902
00:53:57,818 --> 00:54:00,153
And therefore, you lose.

903
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:04,574
But you cheated.
Where did you get that fourth king?

904
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:06,409
I won, I won, I won!

905
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,162
Why, you gypsy! You thief!

906
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:11,497
You're a muttonhead.
Do we go to Trouville?

907
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:14,500
-Yes, yes. You go to Trouville.
-Hooray!

908
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,920
Grandmama, we go to Trouville.

909
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:18,963
It's out of the question.

910
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,716
Not at all. I'd love it.
Believe it or not...

911
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:24,552
...I have a better time
with this outrageous brat...

912
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:27,555
...than anybody in Paris.
It'll be marvelous fun.

913
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:30,850
[SINGS] What time will we get there?
Can I watch you play roulette?

914
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:34,354
May I stay up late for supper?
Is it awfully, awfully upper?

915
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,397
Gigi, you'll drive us wild

916
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:39,525
Stop, you silly child

917
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:44,197
Is everybody celebrated
Full of sin and dissipated?

918
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:47,617
Is it hot enough to blister?
Will I be your little sister?

919
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:50,036
Gigi, you are absurd

920
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:52,705
Now, not another word

921
00:54:53,082 --> 00:54:54,123
Gigi!

922
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,708
Let her gush and jabber

923
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,293
Let her be enthused

924
00:54:57,628 --> 00:55:01,464
I cannot remember
When I have been more amused

-Stop it!
-The night they invented champagne

They thought of you and me

931
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:18,189

00:55:23,112 --> 00:55:26,239

Why, there's Gaston.

945
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:26,507
I didn't know he would
be at Trouville.

946
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:29,052
Who's that child he's with?

947
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:36,350
Me, I'm here on
very important business.

948
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:12,220
There she is.

949
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:02,854
Riding is important.

950
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:04,814
Go.

[GRANDMAMA LAUGHS]

00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:36,304
Chérie...

00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:41,309
...I must tell you that you upset
all my plans for the weekend.

954
00:58:41,602 --> 00:58:43,477
-May I?
-Please.

955
00:58:45,314 --> 00:58:46,814
How did I do that?

956
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:49,442
I came prepared for battle...

957
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:52,820
...and an old wound
prevented me from charging.

958
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:56,282
I don't think she
was your type anyhow, Honoré.

959
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,409
-You were watching me?
-Force of habit.

960
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:02,205
When a pretty woman came by,
I always had to watch you.

961
00:59:02,623 --> 00:59:04,540
What good fortune
brings you to Trouville?

962
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,250
I came with Gaston and Gigi.

963
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,460
You did?

964
00:59:07,628 --> 00:59:09,253
Gigi is my granddaughter.

965
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:11,130
No, not your granddaughter.

966
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:15,676
Oh, yes. Time does not
stand still for all of us, Honoré.

967
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:22,767
Don't be nervous!

968
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:29,065
Gaston is such a dear man.

969
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:32,902
So sweet of him to bring
little Gigi and show her Trouville.

970
00:59:33,654 --> 00:59:35,905
She's having a glorious time.

971
00:59:36,657 --> 00:59:38,157
And so is Gaston.

972
00:59:38,659 --> 00:59:41,202
I haven't seen him this chipper in years.

...didn't we?

Come to think of it,
those last days we spent together...

976
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:55,299
...were by the sea, weren't they?

977
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:56,634
Were they?

978
00:59:57,261 --> 00:59:58,803
Of course they were.

979
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:02,515
On the Riviera. The pink villa.

980
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:05,977
-I only remember the blue villa.
-Which was that?

981
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:08,396
The one belonging to the soprano.

982
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:12,191
You knew.

983
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:13,401
But of course.

984
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:16,529
But I thought you left me
because of that Austrian count.

985
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:17,947
But of course.

986
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:19,490
But you didn't.

987
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:24,745
I'll tell you about that blue villa, Mamita.

988
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:28,916
I was so much in love with you,
I wanted to marry you.

989
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:30,376
Yes, it's true.

990
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:33,421
I was beginning to think of marriage.

991
01:00:33,714 --> 01:00:36,048
Imagine! Marriage, me.

992
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:39,051
No. I was really desperate.

993
01:00:39,386 --> 01:00:42,221
I had to do something.
And what I did was the soprano.

01:00:42,848 --> 01:00:43,931
Thank you, Honoré.

Be thinking of it too

01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:06,258
Yes, Gigi.

01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:10,763
It isn't possible.

1066
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:13,432
Not if it's ruined at the beginning
through lack of tact.

1067
01:04:13,642 --> 01:04:17,770
And when did I display any lack of tact?
It was a most congenial weekend.

1068
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:21,857
So congenial that Gaston returned,

01:16:21,786 --> 01:16:25,163
...who'll marry her and give her
four children in three years?

1240
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:26,498
You're upset. Please--

1241
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:30,835
To see her married in white in
a dingy little church to a plumber...

1242
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:33,213
...who'll only give her
a worthless name...

1243
01:16:33,381 --> 01:16:35,674
...and the squalor of good intentions?

1244
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:37,842
Very well, madame. Very well!

1245
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:39,344
If that's your ambition...

1246
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:42,931
...inflict your misery
in the name of respectability.

1247
01:16:43,182 --> 01:16:45,850
I pity you! I pity you all!

1248
01:16:51,691 --> 01:16:52,732
Upset!

1249
01:16:53,234 --> 01:16:54,693
What utter rubbish!

1250

1251
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:19,884
...do I look upset?

01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:21,845
Yes, monsieur, you do.

Upset!

Upset indeed!

She's a babe

1256
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:35,900
Just a babe

1257
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:37,610
Still cavorting in her crib

1258
01:17:38,029 --> 01:17:39,487
Eating breakfast with a bib

1259
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:42,240
With her baby teeth
And all her baby curls

1260
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:44,034
She's a tot

1261
01:17:44,744 --> 01:17:45,744
Just a tot

1262
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:49,622
Good for bouncing on your knee
I am positive that she

1263
01:17:49,874 --> 01:17:52,125
Doesn't even know
That boys aren't girls

1264
01:17:53,044 --> 01:17:54,085
She's a snip

1265
01:17:54,754 --> 01:17:55,795
Just a snip

1266
01:17:56,422 --> 01:17:59,758
Making dreadful baby noise
Having fun with all her toys

1267
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:02,344
Just a chickadee
Who needs a mother hen

1268
01:18:03,346 --> 01:18:06,264
She's a cub, a papoose
You could never turn her loose

1269
01:18:06,474 --> 01:18:09,267
She's too infantile
To take her from her pen

1270
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:16,358
Of course, that weekend in Trouville

1271
01:18:17,318 --> 01:18:19,194
In spite of all her youthful zeal

1272
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:21,696
She was exceedingly polite

1273
01:18:22,782 --> 01:18:24,699
And on the whole, a sheer delight

1274
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:27,327
And if it wasn't joy galore

1275
01:18:28,412 --> 01:18:30,288
At least not once was she a bore

1276
01:18:31,499 --> 01:18:32,665

1277
01:18:33,834 --> 01:18:35,293
No, not at all

She's a child

1279
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:39,214
A silly child

1280
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:43,134
Adolescent to her toes
And good heaven, how it shows

1281
01:18:43,302 --> 01:18:46,137
Sticky thumbs are all the fingers
She has got

1282
01:18:46,389 --> 01:18:47,430
She's a child

1283
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:49,015
A clumsy child

1284
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:52,811
She's as swollen as a grape
And she doesn't have a shape

1285
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:55,397
Where her figure ought to be
It is not!

1286
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:57,190
Just a child

1287
01:18:57,608 --> 01:18:58,858
A growing child

1288
01:18:59,402 --> 01:19:02,529
But so backward for her years
If a boy her age appears

1289
01:19:02,822 --> 01:19:05,031
I am certain
He will never call again

1290
01:19:05,908 --> 01:19:09,035
She's a scamp and a brat
Doesn't know where she is at

1291
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:11,413
Unequipped and undesirable to men

1292
01:19:14,542 --> 01:19:18,503
Of course, I must in truth confess

1293
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:21,464
That in her brand-new little dress

1294
01:19:21,966 --> 01:19:24,342
She looked surprisingly mature

1295
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:27,220
And had a definite allure

1296
01:19:28,222 --> 01:19:30,348
It was a shock, in fact, to me

1297
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:33,268
A most amazing shock to see

1298
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:35,562
The way it clung

1299
01:19:36,564 --> 01:19:38,148
On one so young

She's a girl

Getting older, it is true
Which is what they always do

1303
01:19:46,866 --> 01:19:50,618
Till that unexpected hour
When they blossom like a flower

1304
01:19:52,413 --> 01:19:53,455
Oh, no.

1305
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:01,588
Oh, no.

1309

When she speaks

1310

Isn’t there?

1311
01:20:14,018 --> 01:20:15,602
A different bloom

1312

About her cheeks

Am I a fool without a mind?

01:20:47,134 --> 01:20:49,344
Or have I merely been too blind

1320

To realize?

1321
01:20:52,306 --> 01:20:53,765
Oh, Gigi

-Yes.

Good. I have an important
business matter to discuss with you.

1362
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:56,864
Now, let us recapitulate.

1363
01:23:57,116 --> 01:23:59,951
To begin with, he said she would
be spoiled as no other--

1364
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:04,247
He said she would be spoiled
as no other woman has been before.

1365
01:24:04,498 --> 01:24:08,334
It's all right, but it's vague.
I like everything spelled out.

1366
01:24:08,502 --> 01:24:10,378
Did he say precisely
where she would live?

1367
01:24:10,629 --> 01:24:13,005
He said a suitable house
on the Avenue du Bois.

1368
01:24:13,257 --> 01:24:14,632
-You're sure?
-Of course.

1369
01:24:14,842 --> 01:24:16,634
Well, very good.
Servants?

1370
01:24:16,844 --> 01:24:18,761
Yes, he mentioned servants.

1371
01:24:19,012 --> 01:24:20,430
What about an automobile?

1372
01:24:20,681 --> 01:24:22,807
I think so. I'm not quite sure.

1373
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:25,393
She must have an automobile
and a chauffeur.

1374
01:24:25,853 --> 01:24:28,938
I'm sure he didn't mean
to be evasive or ungenerous.

1375
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:31,858

and our lawyer...

bring his lawyer to our lawyer.

-Gigi doesn't know yet?
-How could she?

01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:50,168

have dinner with her this evening.

be sure and stress...

1383
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:56,382
...the difficulties of the situation
rather than the delights.

01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:58,259

01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:19,942
...and that I shall sleep in your bed.

1417
01:27:20,402 --> 01:27:21,736
Please, Gigi.

1418
01:27:22,029 --> 01:27:24,196
I beg of you, you embarrass me.

1419
01:27:25,991 --> 01:27:28,910
You weren't embarrassed to
talk to Grandmama about it.

1420
01:27:29,119 --> 01:27:32,455
And Grandmama wasn't embarrassed
to talk to me about it.

1421
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:37,752
But I know more than she told me.
To take care of me...

1422
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:40,963
...means that I shall have
my photograph in the papers.

1423
01:27:41,214 --> 01:27:44,425
That I shall go to the Riviera.
To the races at Deauville.

1424
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:48,512
And when we fight, it will
be in all the columns the next day.

1425
01:27:48,764 --> 01:27:53,017
And when you'd give me up,
as you did with Inès des Cévennes.

1426
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:56,562
Who's been filling your head
with all these old stories?

1427
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:58,689
How do you know about that?

1428
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:01,651
Why shouldn't I know?

1429
01:28:01,902 --> 01:28:03,527
You're world-famous.

1430
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:06,447
I know about the woman
who stole money from you.

1431
01:28:06,657 --> 01:28:08,574
The contessa
who wanted to shoot you.

1432
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:12,370
The American who wanted to marry you.
I know what everybody knows.

1433
01:28:12,579 --> 01:28:15,498
These aren't the things
we have to talk about together.

1434
01:28:15,749 --> 01:28:18,960
That's all in the past,
over and done with.

1435
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:21,128
Yes, Gaston.

1436
01:28:22,506 --> 01:28:24,173
Until it begins again.

1437
01:28:29,054 --> 01:28:31,681
It's not your fault
you're world-famous.

1438
01:28:32,015 --> 01:28:35,393
It's just that I haven't got
a world-famous sort of nature.

1439
01:28:36,937 --> 01:28:41,273
When it's over, Gaston Lachaille
goes off with another lady.

1440
01:28:41,525 --> 01:28:44,443
And I have only to go into
another gentleman's bed.

1441
01:28:46,947 --> 01:28:48,572
That won't do for me.

1442
01:28:49,533 --> 01:28:51,617
I'm not changeable.
That won't do for me.

1443
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:56,539
Grandmama and Aunt Alicia are on
your side, but this concerns me too.

1444
01:28:56,790 --> 01:28:59,625
And I think I should have
something to say about it.

1445
01:29:00,043 --> 01:29:02,586
And what I say is, it won't work.
It won't work!

1446
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:10,845
Gigi....

1447
01:29:12,431 --> 01:29:17,560
Are you trying to find a way
to tell me that I don't please you?

1448
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:19,228
That you don't like me?

1449
01:29:19,438 --> 01:29:20,771
Oh, no, Gaston!

1450
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:23,524
Oh, no. I do like you.

1451
01:29:25,569 --> 01:29:28,029
I'm so happy when I'm with you.

1452
01:29:31,450 --> 01:29:34,160
Gaston, couldn't we go on
just as we are?

1453
01:29:34,453 --> 01:29:36,787
Maybe seeing each other
a little more often?

1454
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:40,541
You're a friend of the family.
Nobody would think anything of it.

1455
01:29:40,834 --> 01:29:43,711
You could go on bringing me
licorice and caramels...

1456
01:29:43,962 --> 01:29:45,671
...and champagne on my birthday.

1457
01:29:45,881 --> 01:29:49,300
And on Sundays, we can have
an extra-special game of cards.

1458
01:29:49,551 --> 01:29:51,677
Wouldn't that be a lovely little life?

1459
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:53,721
A wonderful little life.

1460
01:29:54,097 --> 01:29:56,348
Except that you forget one thing:

1461
01:29:57,267 --> 01:29:58,768
I'm in love with you.

1462
01:30:02,481 --> 01:30:03,898
You never told me.

1463
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:06,859
I haven't known it very long.

1464
01:30:07,611 --> 01:30:10,362
I discovered it
when I was away from you.

1465
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:12,323
In Monte Carlo.

1466
01:30:13,116 --> 01:30:14,492
Oh.

1467
01:30:15,994 --> 01:30:19,371
Oh, you are a wicked man.

1468
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:23,501
Oh, you're in love with me...

1469
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:27,671
...and you want to drag me into a life
that will make me suffer!

1470
01:30:28,090 --> 01:30:32,593
You think nothing of exposing me
to all sorts of terrible adventures...

1471
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:34,887
...ending in quarrels, separations...

1472
01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:37,473
-...pistol shots, Sandomirs and poison!
-Gigi.

1473
01:30:37,641 --> 01:30:39,225
Gigi, please listen to me!

1474
01:30:39,518 --> 01:30:42,436
I should never have
believed this of you. Never!

[GIGI CRIES]

1476
01:30:44,523 --> 01:30:46,023
What's the matter?

1477
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:47,858
What's happened?

1478
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:50,611
She doesn't seem to want to.

1479
01:30:50,821 --> 01:30:52,029
What do you mean?

1480
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:54,115
I mean she doesn't want to!

1481
01:30:54,533 --> 01:30:56,534
Are you going out of your mind?

1482
01:30:56,743 --> 01:30:59,870
As God is my witness,
I explained it to her. Believe me.

1483
01:31:00,122 --> 01:31:02,039
You explained too much!

1484
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:05,960
You've trained her to know
nothing but the sordid and the vulgar.

1485
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:09,922
But what about kindness,
sweetness, benevolence?

1486
01:31:10,173 --> 01:31:13,259
What of the tender heart
bulging with generosity?

1487
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:16,804
These things exist too, madame.
Or have you never heard of them?

1488
01:31:28,775 --> 01:31:30,484
Uncle! I'll tell you...

1489
01:31:30,819 --> 01:31:34,697
...Europe is breeding a generation
of vandals and ingrates.

1490
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:37,491
Children are coming into the world...

1491
01:31:37,742 --> 01:31:39,952
...with ice-covered souls
and hatchets in their hands!

1492
01:31:40,203 --> 01:31:44,123
And before they have finished, they'll
smash everything beautiful and decent.

1493
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:45,374
Have a piece of cheese.

1494
01:31:45,625 --> 01:31:46,667
No, thank you.

1495
01:31:46,835 --> 01:31:49,253
I envy you, uncle.
I envy you your age.

1496
01:31:49,588 --> 01:31:50,713
For you, it was different.

1497
01:31:50,964 --> 01:31:54,300
You've been clean and good,
and it's been appreciated.

1498
01:31:54,593 --> 01:31:57,636
But not anymore. It's over. All over.

1499
01:31:57,888 --> 01:32:00,264
I'm sorry to hear it. A little salad?

1500
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:01,599
No, thank you.

1501
01:32:03,101 --> 01:32:04,977
Imagine this if you can:

1502
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:08,647
Here is a girl, living in
a moldy apartment, decaying walls...

1503
01:32:08,899 --> 01:32:11,817
...worm-ridden furniture,
surrounded by filth.

1504
01:32:12,027 --> 01:32:13,194
You're ruining my lunch.

1505
01:32:13,445 --> 01:32:16,113
Nothing to look forward to
but abject poverty.

1506
01:32:16,281 --> 01:32:18,741
My heart was touched.
I wanted to help her.

1507
01:32:19,034 --> 01:32:21,118
I offered her everything:

1508
01:32:21,328 --> 01:32:24,622
House, car, servants, clothes...

1509
01:32:25,707 --> 01:32:26,957
...and me.

1510
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:30,127
-And?
-She turned me down.

1511
01:32:31,213 --> 01:32:33,130
-Turned you down?
-Turned me down.

1512
01:32:33,381 --> 01:32:34,465
It's impossible.

1513
01:32:34,758 --> 01:32:36,967
It's not impossible. It just happened.

1514
01:32:37,219 --> 01:32:41,138
Obviously, that disgusting apartment
she lives in has driven her mad.

1515
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:43,140
Her grandmother was delighted.

1516
01:32:43,350 --> 01:32:45,142
-Grandmother?
-Yes, Mamita.

1517
01:32:45,352 --> 01:32:47,228
But Gigi-- No, no, no. Not Gigi.

1518
01:32:47,479 --> 01:32:49,647
She refused me.
She turned me down.

1519
01:32:49,898 --> 01:32:52,566
I was refused, rejected, rebuffed...

1520
01:32:53,693 --> 01:32:55,319
...and repudiated.

1521
01:32:56,488 --> 01:33:00,532
They're a very peculiar family
with peculiar ideas.

1522
01:33:00,742 --> 01:33:02,868
I negotiated with them myself once.

1523
01:33:03,036 --> 01:33:07,164
With me, one casual bit
of grazing in another pasture...

1524
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:10,542
...and the gate was slammed behind me.

1525
01:33:11,878 --> 01:33:13,671
What did you do?

1526
01:33:13,922 --> 01:33:15,589
-I left immediately.
-Bravo!

1527
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:18,801
-The absolutely right thing to do.
-Of course.

1528
01:33:18,969 --> 01:33:21,971
And when she sends for you,
which you realize she will--

1529
01:33:22,222 --> 01:33:23,514
Of course. I know she will.

1530
01:33:23,765 --> 01:33:26,934
This is plainly a maneuver
for better terms.

1531
01:33:27,185 --> 01:33:28,602
-Don't you go back!
-Go back?

1532
01:33:28,853 --> 01:33:30,688
I wouldn't go back
for anything in the world.

1533
01:33:30,939 --> 01:33:34,566
After all, you behaved
like a perfect gentleman.

1534
01:33:34,818 --> 01:33:36,193
No question about it.

1535
01:33:36,361 --> 01:33:39,196
You made your offer in good faith...

1536
01:33:39,406 --> 01:33:41,949
...before any emotional advance.

1537
01:33:42,325 --> 01:33:45,202
An act of the purest chivalry.

1538
01:33:45,412 --> 01:33:47,371
I don't know any other way.

1539
01:33:47,706 --> 01:33:51,792
And if she doesn't appreciate
the nobility of your conduct...

1540
01:33:52,335 --> 01:33:55,045
...if she uses the beauty of your nature...

1541
01:33:55,255 --> 01:33:57,381
...as a weapon for bargaining...

1542
01:33:58,133 --> 01:34:03,262
...then she's obviously not worth
the chivalry or the nobility.

1543
01:34:03,596 --> 01:34:06,432
It's no one's fault.
You're too good for her.

1544
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:10,227
Do you know how long
it will take you to forget her?

1545
01:34:10,603 --> 01:34:13,355
By tomorrow noon at the latest.

1546
01:34:14,774 --> 01:34:18,527
Why not consult your little book
and meet me at Maxim's tonight?

1547
01:34:18,778 --> 01:34:20,112
Splendid idea.

1548
01:34:20,363 --> 01:34:21,989
I would suggest a redhead.

1549
01:34:22,532 --> 01:34:25,284
Try Michèle. I saw her last night.
She looked heavenly.

1550
01:34:25,535 --> 01:34:26,744
I'll call her at once.

1551
01:34:26,995 --> 01:34:29,288
You should. She doesn't
have many good years left.

1552
01:34:29,539 --> 01:34:30,956
-See you at 9?
-Nine sharp.

1553
01:34:31,124 --> 01:34:32,624
-Nine.
