QUITE RIGHT YET,

OCCUR TO YOU?

HOW MY CHILDREN BEHAVE
IS NO CONCERN OF YOURS,

201
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,585

01:03:49,202 --> 01:03:51,204
WHY, THANK YOU.

1059
01:03:51,204 --> 01:03:53,707
I MUST AGREE
WITH YOU THERE.

1060
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:59,212
ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?

1061
01:03:59,212 --> 01:04:00,714
LOVELY.

1062
01:04:00,714 --> 01:04:02,716
JUST LOVELY.

1063
01:04:06,203 --> 01:04:08,705
JEREMY, IT'S NOT
NICE TO PEEK.

1064
01:04:08,705 --> 01:04:10,707
I'M NOT PEEKING,
I'M LOOKING.

1065
01:04:10,707 --> 01:04:12,709
DO THEY LIKE
EACH OTHER?

1066
01:04:12,709 --> 01:04:14,211
OF COURSE.

1067
01:04:14,211 --> 01:04:16,213
THINK THEY'LL
GET MARRIED?

1068
01:04:16,213 --> 01:04:18,215
HAS HE
KISSED HER YET?

1069
01:04:18,215 --> 01:04:19,216
NOT YET.

1070
01:04:19,216 --> 01:04:22,736
WHEN THEY KISS, THEY'LL 
HAVE TO GET MARRIED.

1071
01:04:28,191 --> 01:04:30,193
JEREMY, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

1072
01:04:30,193 --> 01:04:32,195
KEEPING A LOOKOUT
FOR PIRATES.

1073
01:04:32,195 --> 01:04:33,697
THERE AREN'T
ANY PIRATES,

1074
01:04:33,697 --> 01:04:35,198
ARE THERE, TRULY?

1075
01:04:35,198 --> 01:04:37,200
OH, I'M SURE
THERE ARE,

1076
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,702
HUNDREDS OF THEM.

1077
01:04:38,702 --> 01:04:41,204
THIS IS WHERE
THEY BURY TREASURE,

1078
01:04:41,204 --> 01:04:42,706
ISN'T IT, DADDY?

1079
01:04:42,706 --> 01:04:43,707
MM-HMM.

1080
01:04:43,707 --> 01:04:46,710
TELL US A STORY
ABOUT PIRATES, DADDY.

1081
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:48,712
A STORY
ABOUT PIRATES, HUH?

1082
01:04:48,712 --> 01:04:50,714
WELL, LET ME SEE.

1083
01:04:50,714 --> 01:04:52,149
A BOAT!

1084
01:04:52,149 --> 01:04:54,100
I SEE A BOAT!

1085
01:04:55,101 --> 01:04:56,603
A BOAT?

1086
01:04:56,603 --> 01:04:59,105
DID YOU SAY A BOAT?

1087
01:04:59,105 --> 01:05:02,108
THAT ISN'T JUST
ANY BOAT OUT THERE.

1088
01:05:02,108 --> 01:05:03,610
NO?
NO?

1089
01:05:03,610 --> 01:05:06,112
NO. THAT IS
A PRIVATE YACHT

1090
01:05:06,112 --> 01:05:08,114
OF THE NOTORIOUS
BARON BOMBURST.

1091
01:05:08,114 --> 01:05:09,616
BARON BOMBURST?

1092
01:05:09,616 --> 01:05:12,619
YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD
OF BARON BOMBURST,

1093
01:05:12,619 --> 01:05:14,120
RULER OF VULGARIA?

1094
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:17,123
THE MOST EVIL MAN
IN THE WORLD!

1095
01:05:17,123 --> 01:05:18,625
OH!
GOSH!

1096
01:05:18,625 --> 01:05:21,628
HE HAS SAILED
ALL THE WAY TO ENGLAND.

1097
01:05:21,628 --> 01:05:24,631
HE'S HEARD TELL
OF A FANTASTIC MOTORCAR

1098
01:05:24,631 --> 01:05:28,134
BUILT BY THAT BRILLIANT
INVENTOR, CARACTACUS POTTS.

1099
01:05:28,134 --> 01:05:30,136
HOORAY! HOORAY! 
HOORAY!

1100
01:05:30,136 --> 01:05:31,571
YES, HOORAY!

1101
01:05:31,571 --> 01:05:34,541
HE HAS COME
TO STEAL THE CAR

1102
01:05:34,541 --> 01:05:37,043
AND TAKE IT BACK
TO VULGARIA.

1103
01:05:42,899 --> 01:05:44,084
OH, YES!

1104
01:05:44,084 --> 01:05:45,085
AH!

1105
01:05:45,085 --> 01:05:46,836
THAT CAR!

1106
01:05:47,087 --> 01:05:48,788
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

1107
01:05:49,072 --> 01:05:50,574
I WANT IT!

1108
01:05:50,574 --> 01:05:53,076
ARE YOU GIVING ME
AN ARGUMENT?

1109
01:05:53,076 --> 01:05:55,078
STAND BY THE BOATS!

1110
01:05:55,078 --> 01:05:57,080
STAND BY
THE BOATS!

1111
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:58,582
LOAD THE CANNON!

1112
01:05:58,582 --> 01:06:00,283
LOAD THE CANNON!

1113
01:06:00,567 --> 01:06:01,568
HE'S AWFUL.

1114
01:06:01,568 --> 01:06:03,069
HE'S TERRIBLE.

1115
01:06:03,069 --> 01:06:05,071
HE ISN'T EVEN NICE.

1116
01:06:05,071 --> 01:06:07,073
HE CAN'T STEAL
OUR CAR!

1117
01:06:07,073 --> 01:06:08,575
LOOK! THEY'RE
GETTING CLOSER.

1118
01:06:08,575 --> 01:06:10,577
WE'VE GOT TO
GET AWAY!

1119
01:06:10,577 --> 01:06:12,078
START THE CAR.

1120
01:06:12,078 --> 01:06:13,480
QUICKLY, DADDY!

1121
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:15,565
THAT'S EASIER SAID
THAN DONE.

1122
01:06:15,565 --> 01:06:17,567
BUT WHY, DADDY? WHY?

1123
01:06:17,567 --> 01:06:19,069
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU.

1124
01:06:19,069 --> 01:06:21,071
WHAT NONE OF US
HAVE NOTICED,

1125
01:06:21,071 --> 01:06:23,073
WHILE WE'VE BEEN
SITTING HERE,

1126
01:06:23,073 --> 01:06:25,575
THE TIDE
HAS BEEN COMING IN.

1127
01:06:25,575 --> 01:06:27,143
WE'RE COMPLETELY CUT OFF.

1128
01:06:27,143 --> 01:06:29,379
OH! 
OH! OH!

1129
01:06:29,379 --> 01:06:32,032
WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO?

1130
01:06:32,032 --> 01:06:33,350
HURRY, MR. POTTS!

1131
01:06:33,350 --> 01:06:35,018
EVERYONE
STAY CALM!

1132
01:06:35,018 --> 01:06:36,503
QUICKLY, DADDY.

1133
01:06:36,503 --> 01:06:38,004
AH, LOOK!

1134
01:06:38,004 --> 01:06:41,007
THEY ARE COMPLETELY
CUT OFF BY THE TIDE.

1135
01:06:41,007 --> 01:06:43,009
THEY WILL ALL DROWN!

1136
01:06:43,009 --> 01:06:46,513
I HAVEN'T SEEN
A GOOD DROWNING IN YEARS!

1137
01:06:46,513 --> 01:06:48,648
HO HO HO!
HA HA HA!

1138
01:06:48,982 --> 01:06:50,667

01:06:50,884 --> 01:06:52,252
PUSH THE THROTTLE!

1140
01:06:52,252 --> 01:06:53,687
HURRY, DADDY! HURRY!

1141
01:06:53,937 --> 01:06:55,872
QUICKLY!

1142
01:06:55,872 --> 01:06:57,173
THE OTHER ONE!

1143
01:06:57,173 --> 01:06:59,209
IT WON'T START!

1144
01:06:59,209 --> 01:07:02,295
WE WILL
HAVE TO SWIM FOR IT.

1145
01:07:02,295 --> 01:07:03,797
COME ON, JEMIMA.

1146
01:07:03,797 --> 01:07:05,298
COME ON. COME ON.

1147
01:07:05,799 --> 01:07:06,800
OVER THE SIDE.

1148
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:08,301
[BANG]

1149
01:07:08,802 --> 01:07:10,487
IT'S STARTING!

1150
01:07:10,487 --> 01:07:12,372
EVERYBODY HOLD ON!

1151
01:07:12,372 --> 01:07:13,857
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE!

1152
01:07:15,859 --> 01:07:17,360
OH, THIS IS
POSITIVELY CLEVER!

1153
01:07:17,861 --> 01:07:19,362
WHEE!

YOU BUILT IT!

1156
01:07:22,332 --> 01:07:24,551
YOU ALWAYS SAID
IT WAS MAGIC.

1157
01:07:24,801 --> 01:07:26,269

01:07:35,011 --> 01:07:36,713
A FLOATING CAR?

1163
01:07:36,713 --> 01:07:39,215
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THAT?

1164
01:07:39,215 --> 01:07:40,717
A CAR FLOATING,

1165
01:07:40,717 --> 01:07:42,569
FLOATING ON
THE WATER FOAM.

1166
01:07:48,675 --> 01:07:50,176
THIS IN
MY WHOLE LIFE,

1167
01:07:50,176 --> 01:07:52,729

TO SEEN.

1168
01:07:52,729 --> 01:07:54,064

01:10:22,462 --> 01:10:22,962
AH!

01:10:28,468 --> 01:10:30,970
I HAVE A SECRET MISSION

1208
01:10:31,471 --> 01:10:32,972

AND YOU WILL CAPTURE
THAT MOTORCAR, UNDERSTAND?

1210
01:10:36,476 --> 01:10:37,977
GOOD. BUT...

1211
01:10:38,478 --> 01:10:39,479
IF YOU FAIL,

1212
01:10:39,979 --> 01:10:42,982
I WILL CUT OFF
YOUR HEADS.

1213
01:10:43,483 --> 01:10:44,484

1214
01:10:46,486 --> 01:10:48,821

1225
01:11:35,952 --> 01:11:37,453
FOR THE TIME OF YEAR.

1226
01:11:37,954 --> 01:11:39,956
DO YOU NOT THINK SO,
CUTHBORT?

1227
01:11:40,456 --> 01:11:42,041
INDUBITABLY, BASIL.

IT'S A PRETTY SILLY
NAME, ISN'T IT?

1231
01:11:54,887 --> 01:11:56,889
OH, I DON'T
THINK SO.

1232
01:11:56,889 --> 01:11:57,890

02:19:54,690 --> 02:19:56,192
ARE YOU--

2294
02:19:56,192 --> 02:19:57,693
[SHOUTING]

2295
02:20:02,148 --> 02:20:05,350
BOOM! THAT'S WIPED OUT
YOUR DASHED CAVALRY.

2296
02:20:05,350 --> 02:20:08,854
I HAVE MY SECOND
INFANTRY BATTALION

2297
02:20:08,854 --> 02:20:10,856
ATTACKING HERE
FROM THE REAR.

2298
02:20:10,856 --> 02:20:13,859
ATTACKING FROM THE REAR?
THAT'S DASHED UNETHICAL.

2299
02:20:13,859 --> 02:20:15,861
ARTILLERY,
PREPARE TO OPEN FIRE.

2300
02:20:15,861 --> 02:20:16,862
FIRE!

2301
02:20:17,129 --> 02:20:19,364
NUMBER ONE BATTALION,
PREPARE TO ADVANCE!

2302
02:20:19,364 --> 02:20:21,133
WHAT'S GOING ON?

2303
02:20:21,133 --> 02:20:23,351
AH, THERE YOU ARE,
YOUNG POTTS.

2304
02:20:23,351 --> 02:20:25,353
BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

2305
02:20:25,353 --> 02:20:27,355
AHA! WIPED OUT
YOUR ARTILLERY!

2306
02:20:27,355 --> 02:20:29,357
YOU'RE A CAD,
POTTS.

2307
02:20:29,357 --> 02:20:31,359
WHAT'S GOING ON?

2308
02:20:31,359 --> 02:20:33,862
FANCY YOU BEING
OLD BUNGIE'S SON--

2309
02:20:33,862 --> 02:20:36,865
BUNGIE POTTS, BEST
BATMAN I EVER HAD.

2310
02:20:36,865 --> 02:20:38,366
YOU WERE--

2311
02:20:38,366 --> 02:20:40,869
ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE
MY BRIGADIER.

2312
02:20:40,869 --> 02:20:43,338
HOW ABOUT
SOME MORE TEA?

2313
02:20:43,688 --> 02:20:45,307
YES, SIR.
RIGHT AWAY, SIR.

2314
02:20:45,307 --> 02:20:48,810
YOUNG MAN,
THERE'S A CHANCE
YOU'LL BE RICH.

2315
02:20:48,810 --> 02:20:50,295
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

2316
02:20:50,295 --> 02:20:52,764
THOSE CONFOUNDED
SWEETS OF YOURS.

2317
02:20:52,764 --> 02:20:55,267
USELESS FOR HUMANS, 
WONDERFUL FOR DOGS.

2318
02:20:55,267 --> 02:20:57,269
WOOF SWEETS
WE'LL CALL THEM.

2319
02:20:57,269 --> 02:20:59,271
CANINE CANDIES. 
DOGS LOVE THEM.

2320
02:20:59,271 --> 02:21:01,273
MAKE A FORTUNE.

2321
02:21:01,273 --> 02:21:03,275
YOU'VE DONE IT,
DADDY.

2322
02:21:03,275 --> 02:21:07,279
IT'S THE POSH LIFE
FOR US NOW, MY BOY.

2323
02:21:07,279 --> 02:21:08,780
WE'LL BE RICH!

2324
02:21:08,780 --> 02:21:09,781
HOORAY!

2325
02:21:09,781 --> 02:21:12,284
I INVENTED SOMETHING
THAT ACTUALLY WORKS?

2326
02:21:12,284 --> 02:21:15,287
I'VE GOT A CONTRACT.
SIGN HERE, PLEASE.

2327
02:21:16,788 --> 02:21:19,291
WAIT.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

2328
02:21:19,291 --> 02:21:21,243
WHAT ABOUT
THE CONTRACT?

2329
02:21:21,343 --> 02:21:23,261
DADDY,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

2330
02:21:23,261 --> 02:21:24,379
DADDY!

2331
02:21:28,733 --> 02:21:30,735
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH HIM?

2332
02:21:30,735 --> 02:21:34,239
WELL, HE'S A BIT
OF AN ECCENTRIC, SIR,

2333
02:21:34,239 --> 02:21:36,241
A GENIUS,
OF COURSE,

2334
02:21:36,241 --> 02:21:38,243
BUT DEFINITELY
AN ECCENTRIC.

2335
02:21:38,243 --> 02:21:41,746
CAN'T IMAGINE
WHERE HE GETS IT FROM.

2336
02:21:45,984 --> 02:21:47,686
TRULY, YOU'LL NEVER
BELIEVE IT.

2337
02:21:47,686 --> 02:21:50,188
YOUR FATHER
WAS AT MY HOUSE.

2338
02:21:50,188 --> 02:21:52,691
THEY TOLD ME
AT THE HOUSE.

2339
02:21:52,691 --> 02:21:54,693
WE'RE RICH.

2340
02:21:55,126 --> 02:21:56,178
OH!

2341
02:21:56,178 --> 02:21:58,180
YOU KNOW,
MORE THAN THAT,

2342
02:21:58,180 --> 02:22:00,182
I HAVE SUCCEEDED.

2343
02:22:00,182 --> 02:22:02,184
I ALWAYS KNEW
YOU WOULD.

2344
02:22:02,184 --> 02:22:04,186
YOU KNOW
SOMETHING ELSE?

2345
02:22:04,186 --> 02:22:06,188
THE KIDS WERE RIGHT.

2346
02:22:06,188 --> 02:22:08,690
THERE'S NOTHING
RIDICULOUS ABOUT
GETTING MARRIED.

2347
02:22:08,690 --> 02:22:10,692
WHOEVER SAID
THERE WAS?

2348
02:22:17,699 --> 02:22:19,701
WELL, MR. POTTS.

2349
02:22:19,701 --> 02:22:21,703
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

2350
02:22:21,703 --> 02:22:24,206
NOW YOU'LL HAVE TO
MARRY ME.

2351
02:22:29,194 --> 02:22:31,196
SO DREAMS
CAN COME TRUE.

2352
02:22:31,196 --> 02:22:33,198
YES, THEY CAN,

2353
02:22:33,198 --> 02:22:36,201
BUT YOU HAVE TO
BE PRACTICAL, TOO.

2354
02:22:36,201 --> 02:22:38,203
YOU HAVE TO FACE FACTS.

2355
02:22:38,203 --> 02:22:41,706
MEN SHOULD SEE THINGS
AS THEY REALLY ARE.

2356
02:22:42,140 --> 02:22:43,675
A MAN
WITH RESPONSIBILITIES

2357
02:22:43,675 --> 02:22:46,678
CAN'T HAVE HIS HEAD
IN THE CLOUDS.

2358
02:22:46,678 --> 02:22:50,682
A MAN SHOULD KEEP
HIS FEET ON THE GROUND.

2359
02:22:50,682 --> 02:22:53,184
A MAN SHOULD
HAVE HIS DREAMS

2360
02:22:53,184 --> 02:22:56,688
BUT LEARN TO PUT THEM
TO PRACTICAL USE,

2361
02:22:56,688 --> 02:22:58,189
NOT JUST SIT AROUND

2362
02:22:58,189 --> 02:23:01,192
AND THINK ABOUT THEM
ALL THE TIME.

2363
02:23:08,166 --> 02:23:10,635

2376
02:23:41,082 --> 02:23:43,084
