1
00:00:00,551 --> 00:00:02,218
<i>So here's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee:<i> Sue got fired</i>

2
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:03,720
<i>from McKinley, so now she's</i>

3
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:05,421
<i>at Carmel High
coaching Vocal Adrenaline.</i>

4
00:00:05,456 --> 00:00:07,356
<i>Dalton Academy burnt down,
and all the Warblers</i>

5
00:00:07,391 --> 00:00:09,192
<i>came to McKinley, which is good
because the New Directions!</i>

6
00:00:09,226 --> 00:00:10,860
<i>Didn't have enough kids,
and if they don't win,</i>

7
00:00:10,894 --> 00:00:12,695
<i>the glee club's over,
but it might be anyway</i>

8
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,263
<i>because Rachel got
accepted back at NYADA</i>

9
00:00:14,298 --> 00:00:15,932
<i>and got offered
a role on Broadway.</i>

10
00:00:15,966 --> 00:00:17,926
<i>And that's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

11
00:00:20,178 --> 00:00:22,012
All right, I don't care
what the body's doing.

12
00:00:22,046 --> 00:00:24,181
Just make sure the<i> facce</i>
is doing something special.

13
00:00:24,215 --> 00:00:26,516
A five, six, seven, eight.

14
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:28,719
Show it. Hide it.

15
00:00:28,753 --> 00:00:30,854
Hit your friend,
hit your friend.

16
00:00:30,888 --> 00:00:33,724
- Grab the jelly... - Good, you guys.
Remember, show faces.

17
00:00:33,758 --> 00:00:36,526
Make a sandwich, throw it down.
Stay at home, stay at home.

18
00:00:36,561 --> 00:00:38,328
Leave your home, seven, eight.

19
00:00:38,363 --> 00:00:40,497
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

20
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:42,933
Mother, may I point to you?

21
00:00:42,967 --> 00:00:45,002
- All right, not bad, guys.
- Yay! That was so good, you guys!

22
00:00:45,036 --> 00:00:46,236
Let's take five.

23
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,238
Uh, no, no, no.
Let's not take five.

24
00:00:48,272 --> 00:00:50,674
- Excuse me? - My feet are like
an outtake from<i> Black Swan,</i>

25
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:53,010
but you don't hear me
complaining...

26
00:00:53,044 --> 00:00:55,846
Because my fellow Warblers and I
understand the stakes involved.

27
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,360
May I remind you that if
we don't win sectionals,

28
00:00:58,383 --> 00:01:00,884
Glee Club no longer exists.

29
00:01:00,918 --> 00:01:02,386
Do you think
Sue Sylvester is giving

30
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,888
Vocal Adrenaline
a five minute break? No.

31
00:01:04,922 --> 00:01:07,924
This weekend, I saw them
walking on hot coals.

32
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,960
(all screaming)

33
00:01:11,396 --> 00:01:13,797
If Oprah can do this,
so can you.

34
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:18,735
- We suck!
- Okay, you suck!

35
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,470
Take a nap, Nickelodeon.

36
00:01:20,505 --> 00:01:21,938
(all arguing indistinctly)

37
00:01:21,973 --> 00:01:24,041
- Relax.
- KURT: Come on, guys.

38
00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:25,809
Everyone's improving
very nicely.

39
00:01:25,843 --> 00:01:27,878
This is not the time to panic.

40
00:01:27,912 --> 00:01:29,713
But it is time to be pragmatic.

41
00:01:29,747 --> 00:01:31,615
With all due respect
to our well-meaning teachers,

42
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:34,584
there is zero chance
of beating Vocal Adrenaline

43
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,554
with rudimentary moves like
"Mother, may I point

44
00:01:37,588 --> 00:01:38,722
to you?"

45
00:01:38,756 --> 00:01:40,223
- I love that move.
- It's awesome.

46
00:01:40,258 --> 00:01:42,259
- Thank you.
- Moreover, the Warblers and I

47
00:01:42,293 --> 00:01:44,394
recently had a little sidebar,
and we believe it's time

48
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:46,964
for a frank discussion about
who should be featured up front.

49
00:01:46,998 --> 00:01:48,665
And who should be...

50
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,100
- hidden in the back.
- JANE: No.

51
00:01:50,134 --> 00:01:51,802
The only three girls
in this group

52
00:01:51,836 --> 00:01:53,070
are not moving to the back.

53
00:01:53,104 --> 00:01:54,504
Nope.

54
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:56,073
- Uh-uh.
- Oh, no, no, no.

55
00:01:56,107 --> 00:01:57,274
I wasn't talking
about the girls.

56
00:01:57,308 --> 00:01:59,476
I was talking about...

57
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,078
Just say it, Skyler.

58
00:02:01,112 --> 00:02:02,980
The dead weight.

59
00:02:03,014 --> 00:02:05,494
Look, we all know that some of
us aren't as physically fit

60
00:02:05,516 --> 00:02:08,018
as others, but give
Roderick some time.

61
00:02:08,052 --> 00:02:10,320
He's got a killer voice
and he's a quick learner.

62
00:02:10,355 --> 00:02:12,189
I guarantee he can get
the dance moves, dude.

63
00:02:12,223 --> 00:02:13,290
And when will you
get them, dude?

64
00:02:13,324 --> 00:02:14,524
You're just as bad as he is.

65
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:15,592
You're worse!

66
00:02:15,627 --> 00:02:17,260
You dance like a blind man

67
00:02:17,295 --> 00:02:18,762
with a back brace
who hasn't taken

68
00:02:18,796 --> 00:02:20,530
a dump in three weeks!

69
00:02:20,565 --> 00:02:21,865
Hey, I don't have to dance good.

70
00:02:21,899 --> 00:02:23,267
I just need to look good,
and I do.

71
00:02:23,301 --> 00:02:24,501
Get over yourself!

72
00:02:24,535 --> 00:02:26,169
We all look good.

73
00:02:26,204 --> 00:02:28,105
Even Julianne Moore over there.

74
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:29,640
Order, order, gentlemen.
What?

75
00:02:29,674 --> 00:02:32,276
Look, I have to agree
with super gay Warbler.

76
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,279
I love you guys, but we
just can't afford to lose.

77
00:02:35,313 --> 00:02:37,915
So, unless you magically get
better, like, this second,

78
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,349
then I think you should

79
00:02:39,384 --> 00:02:41,384
take one for the team
and maybe just...

80
00:02:41,386 --> 00:02:43,186
stay hidden in the back row.

(school bell ringing)

83
00:02:56,935 --> 00:02:58,302
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm...

84
00:02:58,336 --> 00:02:59,670
I'm fine.

85
00:02:59,704 --> 00:03:00,737
No, you're a mess.

86
00:03:00,772 --> 00:03:02,639
Let me help you with that.

87
00:03:02,674 --> 00:03:04,741
Thanks.

88
00:03:04,776 --> 00:03:06,977
How the hell are we supposed
to get this routine down

89
00:03:07,011 --> 00:03:08,545
if I can't even
get through my day

90
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,013
without tripping over myself?

91
00:03:10,048 --> 00:03:11,548
We're screwed.

92
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,584
I feel like a hippo
trying to do ballet

93
00:03:13,618 --> 00:03:16,420
like some strange nightmare
out of<i> Fantasia.</i>

94
00:03:16,454 --> 00:03:18,355
I know, man. I got
moves on the field,

95
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:20,357
but I can't seem to get these
dance moves down. It's...

96
00:03:20,391 --> 00:03:22,326
right, left,
right, left... Yeah?

97
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,894
No, I thought it was
left and then right.

98
00:03:23,928 --> 00:03:25,696
Well... I don't know.

99
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,164
I mean, how are we supposed
to get through this routine

100
00:03:27,198 --> 00:03:28,532
if neither one of us
actually even knows it?

101
00:03:28,566 --> 00:03:29,600
I mean, we need
someone to help us.

102
00:03:29,634 --> 00:03:31,034
- Maybe Alistair can...
- No.

103
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:32,536
No, I'm sorry.
I just don't want

104
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,171
- to watch you two make
out all weekend. - Yeah.

105
00:03:34,205 --> 00:03:36,039
But we got to have someone
to whip us into shape.

106
00:03:36,074 --> 00:03:37,274
Well, how about Mr. Shue, then?

107
00:03:37,308 --> 00:03:38,675
He's the best dancer.

108
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,677
We need his moves,
but he'll just

109
00:03:40,712 --> 00:03:43,113
tell us he's proud of us even
when we're doing a subpar job.

110
00:03:43,147 --> 00:03:44,414
Who we really need...

111
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:45,849
- is Kitty.
- Is Kitty.

112
00:03:45,884 --> 00:03:47,784
I mean, she's by far
our harshest critic.

113
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:49,086
And a true taskmaster.

114
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,420
She'll make at least
one of us cry.

115
00:03:50,455 --> 00:03:51,889
Yeah.

116
00:03:51,923 --> 00:03:53,223
I'll see you later.
(school bell rings)

117
00:03:53,258 --> 00:03:54,525
Want to do that.

118
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:56,393
And try this one second.

119
00:03:56,427 --> 00:03:58,595
Hey, uh, Rachel, do you have
a second to go over this list?

120
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,297
I-I-I thought that Kurt

121
00:04:00,331 --> 00:04:02,533
- had the set list for sectionals
nailed down. - Uh, yeah.

122
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:04,034
No, this is a list of performers

123
00:04:04,068 --> 00:04:05,802
that, uh, finished
their college degrees

124
00:04:05,837 --> 00:04:07,371
before they actually...

125
00:04:07,405 --> 00:04:09,406
Sam...
jumped to Broadway or Hollywood.

126
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,874
We talked about this, okay?
You were very clear

127
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:11,975
about how you felt,
and I'm very clear

128
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,076
about how I feel.

129
00:04:13,111 --> 00:04:14,912
Patti LuPone, Carrie Underwood,

130
00:04:14,946 --> 00:04:17,147
- Meryl Streep.
- Okay, look. You know what?

131
00:04:17,182 --> 00:04:19,249
I knew you were gonna do this,
so I made a list of all

132
00:04:19,284 --> 00:04:20,984
the performers who either
dropped out of college

133
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,287
or who didn't go at all, and
who had very successful careers.

134
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:25,055
Here you go... Lady
Gaga, Coco Chanel

135
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:27,224
and Miss Barbra
Streisand herself.

136
00:04:27,258 --> 00:04:29,259
I know you, so I made
this list of people

137
00:04:29,294 --> 00:04:31,461
that dropped out
and were huge for five minutes,

138
00:04:31,496 --> 00:04:32,963
but then were
never heard of again.

139
00:04:32,997 --> 00:04:34,832
Kesha.

140
00:04:34,866 --> 00:04:36,900
- Kesha's still performing.
- Okay, well, my bad. I'm just...

141
00:04:36,935 --> 00:04:38,469
Sam, please, look.

142
00:04:38,503 --> 00:04:40,270
I hear you, okay?

143
00:04:40,305 --> 00:04:42,272
And you're being a
really good friend.

144
00:04:42,307 --> 00:04:44,408
I just... I don't want to
talk about this anymore

145
00:04:44,442 --> 00:04:47,311
unless you support
my choice, okay?

146
00:04:47,345 --> 00:04:48,812
All right.

147
00:04:48,847 --> 00:04:51,615
You know...

148
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:53,350
we all support you.

149
00:04:53,384 --> 00:04:54,785
Okay, we always do.

150
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:57,821
Just please, think
about the future, okay?

151
00:04:57,856 --> 00:04:59,123
And not just, like,
the next month

152
00:04:59,157 --> 00:05:00,691
or the next big
ticket out of here,

153
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:02,359
but actually look
back at yourself

154
00:05:02,393 --> 00:05:03,994
from the future and ask

155
00:05:04,028 --> 00:05:06,530
if dropping out of NYADA was
something you're proud of.

156
00:05:14,672 --> 00:05:16,473
Hmm.

157
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:20,411

Wow. Jessie St. James.

194
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:26,070
- Hmm.
- What are you doing here?

195
00:07:26,104 --> 00:07:28,238
I'm from here, remember?

196
00:07:28,273 --> 00:07:30,140
And I'm just in town
for a couple of days.

197
00:07:30,175 --> 00:07:32,810
My mom is getting a tummy tuck
and a little eye work done.

198
00:07:32,844 --> 00:07:35,579
So... I thought she could use
a little help around the house.

199
00:07:35,614 --> 00:07:37,681
The real question is,
Rachel Berry...

200
00:07:37,716 --> 00:07:39,450
what are you doing here?

201
00:07:39,484 --> 00:07:41,518
What? I'm coaching
the glee club.

202
00:07:41,553 --> 00:07:43,754
Yeah, we're-we're cramming
for sectionals right now, so...

203
00:07:43,788 --> 00:07:45,456
Well, I heard you were
offered a new role

204
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,658
in the Russell Simmons musical
opposite one of Broadway's

205
00:07:47,692 --> 00:07:49,627
hottest up-and-coming young
actors, but that the producers

206
00:07:49,661 --> 00:07:51,261
are still waiting
to hear back from you.

207
00:07:51,296 --> 00:07:52,696
Wait, how do you know that?

208
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:54,298
Because I'm the hot
up-and-coming young actor

209
00:07:54,332 --> 00:07:56,500
that you're going
to play opposite of.

210
00:07:56,534 --> 00:07:57,968
You're playing Tino?

211
00:07:58,003 --> 00:07:59,770
The Iraqi War vet who was
discharged for covering

212
00:07:59,804 --> 00:08:01,804
the American embassy
with the graffiti that he used

213
00:08:01,806 --> 00:08:03,674
to make him a famous
Philly street artist,

214
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,476
and when he comes home
crippled with PTSD,

215
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,945
it's only his love of hip-hop
that can save his life?

216
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:08,979
(laughs) Yeah.

217
00:08:09,014 --> 00:08:10,681
The producer spent a month

218
00:08:10,715 --> 00:08:12,850
trying the cast the role
of Segovia Shade

219
00:08:12,884 --> 00:08:14,485
until I finally reminded them

220
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:16,487
they found their Segovia Shade.

221
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:19,023
She auditioned for them.
Her name is Rachel Berry.

222
00:08:19,057 --> 00:08:21,692
Jessie, I really appreciate you
doing that for me,

223
00:08:21,726 --> 00:08:24,962
but I just... I-I haven't
made up my mind yet.

224
00:08:24,996 --> 00:08:26,676
Rachel...
(quiet laugh)

225
00:08:26,698 --> 00:08:28,499
It's really fun to come home
every now and again

226
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:30,467
and coach a glee club or...

227
00:08:30,502 --> 00:08:32,469
in my case, help your mom
use her grabber tool

228
00:08:32,504 --> 00:08:34,972
to pull a box of cereal
off the top of the fridge,

229
00:08:35,006 --> 00:08:37,508
but you and I both know
that you belong on Broadway.

230
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:39,310
You need to get your ass
back to New York.

231
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:41,045
I am going back to New York.
Right after sectionals.

232
00:08:41,079 --> 00:08:42,646
I just don't know yet if
it's gonna be for college

233
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:43,921
or for Broadway.

234
00:08:43,949 --> 00:08:44,982
(laughs):
What?!

235
00:08:45,016 --> 00:08:46,183
You can't be serious.

236
00:08:46,217 --> 00:08:47,685
Look, my career was on track.

237
00:08:47,719 --> 00:08:49,887
And then I dropped out of NYADA,

238
00:08:49,921 --> 00:08:51,522
and-and my whole
life fell apart.

239
00:08:51,556 --> 00:08:53,490
So now I have the chance
to rectify that mistake

240
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:56,393
by going back to college, so
what if that's the right choice?

241
00:08:56,428 --> 00:08:58,495
Rachel, your mistake
was not leaving NYADA.

242
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,231
You got the lead role
in<i> Funny Girl.</i>

243
00:09:00,265 --> 00:09:02,032
Nobody could've expected you
to turn that down.

244
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:04,001
Your mistake was leaving
the show too early

245
00:09:04,035 --> 00:09:05,736
to do that stupid sitcom.

246
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:09,373
Look, I'm sure that NYADA
is a great place, and maybe

247
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:10,687
it's because I'm a little biased

248
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:12,076
because she personally
rejected me,

249
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,545
but unless you want
to be Carmen Tibideaux

250
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:17,081
and run a school that claims
to be the nation's top

251
00:09:17,115 --> 00:09:19,216
performing arts institution when
they have a known track record

252
00:09:19,251 --> 00:09:21,518
for rejecting really
talented young actors...

253
00:09:21,553 --> 00:09:23,754
(sighs)
you don't need to go to college.

254
00:09:23,788 --> 00:09:25,122
Well, thank you for your input.

255
00:09:25,156 --> 00:09:26,757
I really appreciate
your opinion.

256
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,692
I just...

257
00:09:28,727 --> 00:09:32,129
I have to make
this decision on my own.

258
00:09:32,163 --> 00:09:34,231
Fair enough.

259
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:36,634
I know that you'll make
the right decision.

260
00:09:36,668 --> 00:09:39,069
I just...

261
00:09:41,506 --> 00:09:44,475
We make really great
music together, Rachel.

262
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:47,912
We always have.

263
00:09:49,247 --> 00:09:52,349
Think about it.

264
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:55,719
(school bell rings)

265
00:09:55,754 --> 00:09:57,254
Okay, you're in the back row,
but you're gonna be

266
00:09:57,289 --> 00:09:58,656
the best back-row dancers ever.

267
00:09:58,690 --> 00:09:59,823
Okay? Here we go.

268
00:09:59,858 --> 00:10:02,259
A five, six, seven, eight.

269
00:10:02,294 --> 00:10:04,495
Step together, step together.

270
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:06,330
Turn. Slide.

271
00:10:06,364 --> 00:10:07,565
Oh, yeah, slide.

272
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:09,133
WILL and KITTY:
Kick-ball change.

273
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:10,668
Okay, guys, good,
good, good, good.

274
00:10:10,702 --> 00:10:11,836
Um... we're making progress.

275
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,737
A for effort, all right?

276
00:10:13,772 --> 00:10:15,906
Guys, I'm really sorry.
I'm just, like, not a dancer.

277
00:10:15,941 --> 00:10:17,641
Dude, I'm the one
that's slowing us down.

278
00:10:17,676 --> 00:10:20,110
Okay, anyways,
let's just try it again, okay?

279
00:10:20,145 --> 00:10:22,680
- I'll do it with them. - Okay.
Maybe the music will help.

280
00:10:22,714 --> 00:10:24,081
♪ ♪

281
00:10:24,115 --> 00:10:26,617
Five, six, seven, eight.

282
00:10:26,651 --> 00:10:28,686
Step, step, step, step.

283
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,421
Step together, step together.

284
00:10:30,455 --> 00:10:32,990
Let's just do those turns.

285
00:10:33,024 --> 00:10:35,759
Yes!

286
00:10:35,794 --> 00:10:37,795
(cracks) (groaning)

287
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:40,698
(sighing, groaning) Aw, gross.

288
00:10:40,732 --> 00:10:42,299
Holy crow!

289
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:43,634
You did a number on this thing.

290
00:10:43,668 --> 00:10:45,028
Geez, it looks like
somebody rubbed

291
00:10:45,036 --> 00:10:47,004
beets all over your feet.
I love beets.

292
00:10:47,038 --> 00:10:48,506
The X-rays were negative.
It's just a sprain.

293
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,140
But it's one of the
worst I've ever seen.

294
00:10:50,141 --> 00:10:52,810
It's fine, and I'm
not missing sectionals.

295
00:10:52,844 --> 00:10:54,512
The only way you could put
weight on that thing,

296
00:10:54,546 --> 00:10:56,313
let alone dance,
is if you got a cortisone shot.

297
00:10:56,348 --> 00:10:58,449
Okay.
Well, it'll take away the pain,

298
00:10:58,483 --> 00:11:01,218
but it won't fix the damage.
Damage?

299
00:11:01,253 --> 00:11:03,154
I've read this book before, son.

300
00:11:03,188 --> 00:11:04,889
It's a book written
by these knees.

301
00:11:04,923 --> 00:11:06,524
Looks like
a jacked up C-section.

302
00:11:06,558 --> 00:11:08,225
If you perform
on an ankle like that,

303
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,994
there's no telling
how much worse it'll get.

304
00:11:10,028 --> 00:11:12,196
Torn ligaments,
ruptured tendons.

305
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,166
You take an injury that should
take two weeks to heal,

306
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,335
and you turn it into a month,
a year, maybe never.

307
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,204
I-I've heard enough.
This is insane.

308
00:11:20,238 --> 00:11:21,572
Absolutely not.

309
00:11:21,606 --> 00:11:22,973
There's no way
I can let you perform.

310
00:11:23,008 --> 00:11:24,041
No, it's worth it.

311
00:11:24,075 --> 00:11:25,176
No, Spencer, listen to him.

312
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,244
Look, I'm not the best dancer,

313
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,579
I'm not the best singer,

314
00:11:28,613 --> 00:11:30,814
not even close,
but I'm an athlete.

315
00:11:30,849 --> 00:11:33,250
I'm the one that's supposed to
be tougher than everyone else.

316
00:11:33,285 --> 00:11:35,019
On game day, I'm gonna get

317
00:11:35,053 --> 00:11:37,054
that shot and we're gonna win.

318
00:11:37,088 --> 00:11:38,556
And whatever happens after that,

319
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,890
I'll deal with it.

320
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:46,801
- Hey.
- (Gasps) Oh, my gosh.

321
00:11:46,835 --> 00:11:48,169
What are you doing?
You scared me.

322
00:11:48,203 --> 00:11:49,637
I'm throwing away
all of our old brushes,

323
00:11:49,672 --> 00:11:51,306
and I'm organizing
the foundations.

324
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,974
I found a really good one
to match Spencer's skin tone.

325
00:11:53,008 --> 00:11:55,810
Okay, let me take that and, um,

326
00:11:55,844 --> 00:11:57,078
will you have a seat?

327
00:11:57,112 --> 00:11:58,579
I wanted to talk to you
for a second.

328
00:11:58,614 --> 00:11:59,654
Are you gonna give me

329
00:11:59,682 --> 00:12:00,715
the same speech that Sam did?

330
00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:02,850
Look, Rachel,

331
00:12:02,885 --> 00:12:04,319
I don't want to fight with you.

332
00:12:04,353 --> 00:12:05,720
You know that.

333
00:12:05,754 --> 00:12:07,588
We had the same exact argument
last year.

334
00:12:07,623 --> 00:12:09,324
Broadway or NYADA.

335
00:12:09,358 --> 00:12:11,159
Life is too short.

336
00:12:11,193 --> 00:12:13,895
I truly want you to do
whatever's gonna make you happy,

337
00:12:13,929 --> 00:12:16,998
but I remember you last year,
and you weren't happy.

338
00:12:17,032 --> 00:12:19,000
Last year was hard.
A lot happened.

339
00:12:19,034 --> 00:12:21,569
Yeah, it was hard for all of us.

340
00:12:21,603 --> 00:12:23,771
But a lot of great things
happened to you, too.

341
00:12:23,806 --> 00:12:26,574
You just never got the chance
to enjoy any of them.

342
00:12:26,608 --> 00:12:29,210
I just want you to appreciate
this time in your life.

343
00:12:29,244 --> 00:12:30,945
What if I say no to the show,

344
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,700
and then I never get cast
on Broadway again?

345
00:12:32,715 --> 00:12:34,048
It could be like career suicide.

346
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,683
That's not going
to happen to you.

347
00:12:35,718 --> 00:12:38,786
Listen, you could do
Broadway or NYADA.

348
00:12:38,821 --> 00:12:40,888
You're gonna be great
at whatever you choose.

349
00:12:40,923 --> 00:12:43,191
When I first heard
that you and Blaine

350
00:12:43,225 --> 00:12:45,460
were moving back to Lima
to teach your old glee clubs,

351
00:12:45,494 --> 00:12:47,228
I thought you were crazy,

352
00:12:47,262 --> 00:12:49,764
but I'm so lucky you made
the decision that you did.

353
00:12:49,798 --> 00:12:52,200
You inspired more
than just this group of kids.

354
00:12:52,234 --> 00:12:53,434
You inspired me, too.

355
00:12:53,469 --> 00:12:56,070
What we're doing really matters.

356
00:12:56,105 --> 00:12:58,039
We have a profound effect
on these kids

357
00:12:58,073 --> 00:13:01,042
and their self-esteem and
what they go on to accomplish.

358
00:13:01,076 --> 00:13:02,910
Look, we only have
a few more years left

359
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:04,279
to go to college and learn

360
00:13:04,313 --> 00:13:05,913
all the fun stuff
like acting and fencing

361
00:13:05,948 --> 00:13:07,148
and choreography.

362
00:13:07,182 --> 00:13:09,751
But we also get to go to school

363
00:13:09,785 --> 00:13:11,052
and be inspired in the process.

364
00:13:11,086 --> 00:13:12,954
I mean, how lucky are we?

365
00:13:12,988 --> 00:13:14,656
I just want you
to think about that

366
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,090
while you're making
this decision.

367
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,659
I'm going back to NYADA,

368
00:13:17,693 --> 00:13:19,427
and-and Blaine is real excited

369
00:13:19,461 --> 00:13:21,763
because he just got into NYU
for next semester.

370
00:13:21,797 --> 00:13:23,798
So we get to start over again.

371
00:13:23,832 --> 00:13:25,800
I mean, how many people
really get the opportunity

372
00:13:25,834 --> 00:13:28,336
to go back to the crossroads
they faced a year ago

373
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,672
and choose the other path?

374
00:13:30,706 --> 00:13:33,941
It could all be different.

375
00:13:33,976 --> 00:13:35,343
(school bell ringing)

376
00:13:35,377 --> 00:13:36,577
Hey, Mr. Shue.

377
00:13:36,612 --> 00:13:38,680
All right.

378
00:13:38,714 --> 00:13:40,248
Look, Mr. Schuester,

379
00:13:40,282 --> 00:13:41,950
the glee club got
a special delivery.

380
00:13:41,984 --> 00:13:43,351
Oh, that's so nice.

381
00:13:43,385 --> 00:13:44,986
The return label says GLAAD.

382
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,422
Maybe they're gifts
for hosting the trans choir.

383
00:13:47,456 --> 00:13:49,616
Wait, wait, wait!
Let's all open them on three.

384
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:50,792
Oh, yeah.

385
00:13:50,826 --> 00:13:52,627
One,

386
00:13:52,661 --> 00:13:54,028
two,

387
00:13:54,063 --> 00:13:55,463
three!
No!

388
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:01,369
(screaming)

389
00:14:09,812 --> 00:14:11,446
Quiet, quiet!

390
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,047
(ticking)

391
00:14:16,051 --> 00:14:17,218
Take cover!

392
00:14:17,253 --> 00:14:19,020
(screaming)

393
00:14:28,264 --> 00:14:29,764
It's raining glitter!

394
00:14:31,033 --> 00:14:32,166
Is everyone okay?

395
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:33,601
Who would do this?

396
00:14:35,704 --> 00:14:38,172
Sue.

397
00:14:38,207 --> 00:14:39,374
Sue.

398
00:14:39,408 --> 00:14:41,009
Sue!

399
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:44,979
Please tell me that was insured.

400
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:46,514
Oh, it's not.

401
00:14:46,548 --> 00:14:48,650
But that was very, very pretty.

402
00:14:48,684 --> 00:14:50,151
(sighs)

403
00:14:50,185 --> 00:14:52,086
(Sam groans)

404
00:14:52,121 --> 00:14:55,223
Geez, Sam, are you all right?

405
00:14:55,257 --> 00:14:57,325
Yeah, I think I just
ate some bad meat loaf.

406
00:14:57,359 --> 00:14:58,493
Okay.

407
00:14:58,527 --> 00:15:00,695
(retching) No.

408
00:15:00,729 --> 00:15:02,830
(coughs, sniffles)

409
00:15:02,865 --> 00:15:05,600
I-I'm gonna go get
the school nurse, okay?

410
00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:08,949
Has anyone seen
the school nurse?

411
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:14,075
(Sue giggling)

412
00:15:16,312 --> 00:15:17,579
Sue, what is going on?

413
00:15:17,613 --> 00:15:19,214
Oh, hello, William.

414
00:15:19,248 --> 00:15:20,949
I was just sniggering
behind this<i> Tupidanthus.</i>

415
00:15:20,983 --> 00:15:22,417
You sent those glitter bombs,
and you...

416
00:15:22,451 --> 00:15:24,052
you put eyedrops
in the coffee, didn't you?

417
00:15:24,086 --> 00:15:25,787
Oh, no, no, no, it's actually

418
00:15:25,821 --> 00:15:28,122
in the entire McKinley High
water system.

419
00:15:28,157 --> 00:15:30,892
Everyone at this school is
experiencing what I like to call.

420
00:15:30,926 --> 00:15:32,627
Monte-Sue-ma's revenge.

421
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:34,128
What is wrong with you?

422
00:15:34,163 --> 00:15:35,863
Oh, just another flare-up

423
00:15:35,898 --> 00:15:38,800
of my chronic hate disorder,
that's not going to stop

424
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:40,768
until you quit,
William Schuester.

425
00:15:40,803 --> 00:15:42,470
Oh, my gosh!

426
00:15:42,504 --> 00:15:44,906
Somebody's car's on fire.

427
00:15:55,818 --> 00:15:58,138
(sirens approaching) No.

428
00:16:04,627 --> 00:16:07,629
Oh, Eileen,

429
00:16:07,663 --> 00:16:11,432
preparations are complete,
and my victory is close at hand.

430
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:13,801
If you'll be so kind,
I'd like to get

431
00:16:13,836 --> 00:16:15,937
my signature Carol Brady blowout

432
00:16:15,971 --> 00:16:19,173
before I lead Vocal Adrenaline
to sectionals.

433
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,009
Coming right up.

434
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:24,145
(muffled grunting)

435
00:16:27,283 --> 00:16:28,950
(men shouting)

436
00:16:28,984 --> 00:16:31,419
SUE:
Look at the precision.

437
00:16:31,453 --> 00:16:33,521
Not a goose step out of place.

438
00:16:33,556 --> 00:16:35,190
Simply put,

439
00:16:35,224 --> 00:16:38,092
Vocal Adrenaline
is such a machine.

440
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:39,794
BEISTE: What the hell's
going on in here?

441
00:16:42,231 --> 00:16:43,364
What the hell happened
to your hair?

442
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:44,532
Hello, Sheldon.

443
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:45,867
How did you get in here?

444
00:16:45,901 --> 00:16:47,101
You're not even allowed
on the property.

445
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:48,303
Let's be honest, Sheldon.

446
00:16:48,337 --> 00:16:50,104
If history
has taught us anything,

447
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:52,607
it's that this school is
remarkably easy to break into.

448
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:55,009
You know, Sue, it was Will and I

449
00:16:55,044 --> 00:16:56,878
who stood up for you
when nobody else would.

450
00:16:56,912 --> 00:16:58,546
And you pay me back

451
00:16:58,581 --> 00:17:00,048
by breaking into my locker room?

452
00:17:00,082 --> 00:17:02,984
With the show choir
that trashed my car?

453
00:17:03,018 --> 00:17:07,122
So you can show them
old footage of Nazis?

454
00:17:07,156 --> 00:17:09,824
Do you know what those guys
would've done

455
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:11,726
with a guy like me?

456
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,962
They would've shipped me off.

457
00:17:13,996 --> 00:17:16,498
Or made you the centerpiece
of an awesome zoo.

458
00:17:16,532 --> 00:17:18,633
(laughter)

459
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:20,568
I want you to get out of here.

460
00:17:21,837 --> 00:17:23,071
Now.

461
00:17:23,105 --> 00:17:24,405
Get out of here, all of you!

462
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,573
Get out!

463
00:17:28,177 --> 00:17:30,545
Well, then, Sheldon, I guess
I will see you at sectionals,

464
00:17:30,579 --> 00:17:33,815
and I think you're going
to be very surprised

465
00:17:33,849 --> 00:17:36,251
at what Sue "Lex Luthor"
Sylvester

466
00:17:36,285 --> 00:17:38,787
has managed to accomplish.

467
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,360
ANNOUNCER:
Hey, Northwest Ohio,

468
00:17:46,362 --> 00:17:47,929
are you ready for sectionals?

469
00:17:47,963 --> 00:17:49,898
(applause, whooping)

470
00:17:49,932 --> 00:17:51,733
Let's meet
our distinguished judges.

471
00:17:51,767 --> 00:17:54,269
First, it's Ohio's
favorite vice comptroller,

472
00:17:54,303 --> 00:17:56,604
Donna Landries.

473
00:17:56,639 --> 00:17:58,106
My glaucoma!

474
00:17:59,542 --> 00:18:02,544
Now give it up
for WOHN News 8 anchorman.

475
00:18:02,578 --> 00:18:04,579
Rod Remington.

476
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,217
(shouting)

477
00:18:09,251 --> 00:18:11,186
And last but not least,

478
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,021
raise the roof

479
00:18:13,055 --> 00:18:15,223
for the Westminster Kennel
Club's 2014 Trainer of the Year.

480
00:18:15,257 --> 00:18:17,192
Butch Melman and her champion
standard poodle.

481
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:19,227
Trixie.

482
00:18:23,332 --> 00:18:24,432
(growls)

483
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:25,867
Kicking off our show,

484
00:18:25,901 --> 00:18:28,069
from the John James
Audubon Institute

485
00:18:28,104 --> 00:18:29,237
for Rehabilitative Ornithology,

486
00:18:29,271 --> 00:18:31,306

Oh, nice wig.

493

Very Carol Brady of you.

494
00:19:01,037 --> 00:19:03,972
It's the best human-hair
wig money can buy.

495

Well, okay.

574
00:22:54,932 --> 00:23:00,103
Um, a couple of months ago,
I crawled into this choir room

575
00:23:00,137 --> 00:23:01,671
with a mission.

576
00:23:01,705 --> 00:23:03,506
Selfish one.

577
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,476
I needed you guys to help me
get my groove back.

578
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,545
And, well, it came true.

579
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:13,216
Now the world is
opening up to me, and...

580
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:17,887
the best part is, is that
in this moment, I don't care.

581
00:23:17,921 --> 00:23:20,556
All that matters to me
is you guys

582
00:23:20,591 --> 00:23:24,560
and the strength of this circle
that we've created.

583
00:23:24,595 --> 00:23:27,730

that this could be the last time

587
00:23:40,077 --> 00:23:42,679
that the New Directions!
Performs together, so...

588
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:45,982

I just want to say that

589
00:23:46,016 --> 00:23:47,750
we all couldn't be more proud

590
00:23:47,785 --> 00:23:50,019

Can I just say, I can't believe

703
00:30:37,091 --> 00:30:38,992
I got roped into
doing this thing again...

704
00:30:39,027 --> 00:30:41,995
What has got to be
the lowest form of entertainment

705
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,363
ever known to mankind.

__

707
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:47,567
So when I got the call
this morning, I'm like,

708
00:30:47,602 --> 00:30:50,404
"Okay, Donna Landries,
just calm down.

709
00:30:50,438 --> 00:30:54,274
These groups cannot be worse
than the last time."

710
00:30:54,308 --> 00:30:56,677
And then they were.

711
00:30:56,711 --> 00:30:58,578
I don't know which group
I hated more.

712
00:30:58,613 --> 00:30:59,813
The Vocal Adrenalines
were like...

713
00:30:59,847 --> 00:31:02,015
that was like
sitting through Fallujah.

714
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,784
You gonna point a cannon at me?

715
00:31:03,818 --> 00:31:05,419
Hell no!

716
00:31:05,453 --> 00:31:07,688
And what's up with
this bird school?

717
00:31:07,722 --> 00:31:09,589
I-Is that a public school?

718
00:31:09,624 --> 00:31:12,759
Is that where
my taxpayer dollars are going?

719
00:31:12,794 --> 00:31:14,961
And don't start me
on New Directions! Oh!

720
00:31:14,996 --> 00:31:17,130
Now, Donna, I'm gonna
stop you right there.

721
00:31:17,165 --> 00:31:19,366
They might not be able
to dance or sing,

722
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,201
but when it comes
to New Directions!

723
00:31:21,235 --> 00:31:23,637
Of the female persuasion, ooh.

724
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:25,353
__

725
00:31:25,473 --> 00:31:27,140
I mean, how about
that smoking gal

726
00:31:27,175 --> 00:31:29,443
going Au naturel
with the Pam Grier Afro?

727
00:31:29,477 --> 00:31:32,012
Sister's got it going on.

728
00:31:32,046 --> 00:31:34,715
She got me hankering for
a piping hot cup o' cocoa.

729
00:31:34,749 --> 00:31:37,050
What the hell
did you just say to me?

730
00:31:37,085 --> 00:31:39,565
Technically, I'm not even
supposed to be judging.

__

732
00:31:41,389 --> 00:31:43,657
The invitation was
addressed to Trixie,

733
00:31:43,691 --> 00:31:45,125
so really it's up to the dog.

734
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:47,227
(barks)

735
00:31:47,261 --> 00:31:49,830
Sorry. Trixie's
not racist.

736
00:31:49,864 --> 00:31:52,366
Like all dogs, he sees
in black and white,

737
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,468
and darker skin makes
it harder for him

738
00:31:54,502 --> 00:31:56,982
to make out facial features.

739
00:31:57,005 --> 00:31:58,672
Wait, this dog is a dude?

740
00:31:58,706 --> 00:32:00,307
BUTCH:
He sure is.

741
00:32:00,341 --> 00:32:02,509
And that maleness might
just give us an indication

742
00:32:02,543 --> 00:32:04,177
as to how he's gonna vote.

743
00:32:04,212 --> 00:32:05,646
Now, Trixie...
(clicker clicks)

744
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,314
Trixie, Trixie.

745
00:32:07,348 --> 00:32:11,051
Which glee club displayed
more... "performativity"?

746
00:32:11,085 --> 00:32:12,285
Good boy!

747
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,021
Are you out of your mind?

748
00:32:14,055 --> 00:32:16,423
That was the worst music
I've ever heard.

749
00:32:16,457 --> 00:32:19,726
There's not a single person on
Earth who woke up this morning

750
00:32:19,761 --> 00:32:22,663
and said, "You know what song I
just really need to hear today?"

751
00:32:22,697 --> 00:32:23,764
'Hey, Mickey.'"

752
00:32:23,798 --> 00:32:25,365
And by the time
fatty was singing.

753
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,701
"Take Me to the Church,"
I'm like, "Okay.

754
00:32:27,735 --> 00:32:30,437
Provided the service we attend
is my funeral."

755
00:32:30,471 --> 00:32:33,573
Well, I thought I knew
which show choir had my vote.

756
00:32:33,608 --> 00:32:35,709
But as I scour

757
00:32:35,743 --> 00:32:37,611
the depths of my soul,

758
00:32:37,645 --> 00:32:41,581
I now realize
I have deep reservations

759
00:32:41,616 --> 00:32:44,084
about sending them to regionals.

760
00:32:44,118 --> 00:32:45,585
Well, can we just vote, please?

761
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,554
I got piles.

to announcing the winners,

SUE:
Hello, William.

780
00:34:36,437 --> 00:34:39,072
Well, Sue,

781
00:34:39,107 --> 00:34:41,208
looks like it finally happened.

782
00:34:41,242 --> 00:34:42,909
You lost.

783
00:34:42,944 --> 00:34:45,579
Yeah, in a manner
of speaking, yes.

784
00:34:45,613 --> 00:34:47,714
And I have only one thing
to say to you,

785
00:34:47,749 --> 00:34:49,916
and one thing only:
You're welcome.

786
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:52,586
(chuckles)
I didn't say thank you.

787
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,621
I know, and that's
just plain rude,

788
00:34:54,655 --> 00:34:58,191
because I handed your glee club
a victory on a silver platter,

789
00:34:58,226 --> 00:34:59,693
guaranteeing that
the New Directions!

790
00:34:59,727 --> 00:35:01,895
Will be a part of this school

791
00:35:01,929 --> 00:35:03,397
long after you and I are gone.

792
00:35:03,431 --> 00:35:05,098
Okay, what are you
talking about?

793
00:35:05,133 --> 00:35:07,213
You've spent the last six years
trying to destroy us.

794
00:35:07,235 --> 00:35:09,269
Now you want me to believe
that you suddenly had

795
00:35:09,303 --> 00:35:11,423
a change of heart and you've
been secretly helping us?

796
00:35:11,439 --> 00:35:12,973
Well, that's exactly
what happened,

797
00:35:13,007 --> 00:35:15,309
and I am impressed
that a mind as simple as yours

798
00:35:15,343 --> 00:35:17,110
could make that sophisticated
leap in logic.

799
00:35:17,145 --> 00:35:18,979
What are you talking about?

800
00:35:19,013 --> 00:35:21,915
Well, it is true that I have
spent a better part of a decade

801
00:35:21,949 --> 00:35:23,750
trying to destroy you
and the glee club,

802
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:26,119
for which I harbor a deep
and abiding hatred,

803
00:35:26,154 --> 00:35:29,556
but when that backstabbing
Geraldo Rivera,

804
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:32,459
with his craven
ad hominem hack job...

805
00:35:32,493 --> 00:35:35,329
there were only two people
who stood up for me:

806
00:35:35,363 --> 00:35:38,065
Coach Sheldon "The
Abomination" Beiste

807
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:39,466
and you.

808
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,068
So I took it upon myself

809
00:35:41,102 --> 00:35:42,803
to repay you by sabotaging.

810
00:35:42,837 --> 00:35:45,172
Vocal Adrenaline
from the inside,

811
00:35:45,206 --> 00:35:47,274
handing you a win at sectionals.

812
00:35:47,308 --> 00:35:48,775
Okay, that is insane.

813
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,811
You were absolutely trying
to win today.

814
00:35:50,845 --> 00:35:52,679
You pulled out all the stops.

815
00:35:52,714 --> 00:35:54,181
That was, by far,

816
00:35:54,215 --> 00:35:55,782
the most over-the-top routine.

817
00:35:55,817 --> 00:35:57,517
Vocal Adrenaline has ever done.

818
00:35:57,552 --> 00:35:59,620
Precisely, and it was a routine

819
00:35:59,654 --> 00:36:02,122
specifically tailored
to the deep background

820
00:36:02,156 --> 00:36:04,324
I performed on all three judges.

821
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:06,259
Now, I knew that an
overly produced,

822
00:36:06,294 --> 00:36:10,330
acrobatic spectacle would remind
Vice Comptroller Donna Landries

823
00:36:10,365 --> 00:36:13,200
of that fateful day
back in October of 1964

824
00:36:13,234 --> 00:36:14,801
in Sandusky, Ohio,

825
00:36:14,836 --> 00:36:16,703
when she attended the circus

826
00:36:16,738 --> 00:36:18,872
and witnessed the most notorious

827
00:36:18,906 --> 00:36:23,043
mass clown stomping in the
history of elephant husbandry.

828
00:36:23,077 --> 00:36:25,278
I included a song from Starship

829
00:36:25,313 --> 00:36:26,847
to subconsciously

830
00:36:26,881 --> 00:36:28,682
unsettle Rod Remington,

831
00:36:28,716 --> 00:36:31,318
who was briefly in
an acrimonious group marriage

832
00:36:31,352 --> 00:36:34,221
with all seven members
of Jefferson Airplane.

833
00:36:34,255 --> 00:36:35,789
But what about the dog trainer?

834
00:36:35,823 --> 00:36:37,958
That chick's rocking an IQ
in the low 80s.

835
00:36:37,992 --> 00:36:39,860
She's an actual idiot.

836
00:36:39,894 --> 00:36:41,628
She was always gonna
love you people.

837
00:36:41,663 --> 00:36:43,563
Well, then why did you
put eyedrops

838
00:36:43,598 --> 00:36:45,032
in the McKinley water system?

839
00:36:45,066 --> 00:36:46,633
I mean, why did you
want the glee club

840
00:36:46,668 --> 00:36:48,168
to spend an entire day

841
00:36:48,202 --> 00:36:50,404
violently projectile-vomiting?
Well, I figured

842
00:36:50,438 --> 00:36:52,506
they all needed to lose
a few pounds, and there's

843
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,475
nothing like a day-long
projectile-vomiting sesh

844
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,411
to jump-start
the old metabolism.

845
00:36:57,445 --> 00:36:59,046
Then why the glitter bombs?

846
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,416
Well, that was to trigger
the stress hormone cortisol.

847
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:04,718
A good burst of cortisol
boosts alertness

848
00:37:04,752 --> 00:37:07,254
and takes about three days
to fully exit the system,

849
00:37:07,288 --> 00:37:10,490
giving your glee club a
perfectly timed sensation

850
00:37:10,525 --> 00:37:13,393
of relaxed euphoria
the exact moment

851
00:37:13,428 --> 00:37:16,096
they walked onstage.

852
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,831
Wow.

853
00:37:17,865 --> 00:37:19,099
Yeah.

854
00:37:19,133 --> 00:37:20,267
But why did you blow up my car?

855
00:37:20,301 --> 00:37:23,036
Well, that was just for fun.

856
00:37:24,739 --> 00:37:26,273
Well, Susan...

857
00:37:26,307 --> 00:37:28,275
William.

858
00:37:28,309 --> 00:37:29,843
Looks like this is it.

859
00:37:29,877 --> 00:37:31,645
Yeah.

860
00:37:38,386 --> 00:37:40,420
Wow. No thank-you?

861
00:37:42,156 --> 00:37:43,557
No thank-you for the person

862
00:37:43,591 --> 00:37:45,025
who just described
in painstaking detail

863
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:46,860
how she sacrificed
her own well-being

864
00:37:46,894 --> 00:37:48,795
to save your glee club

865
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:51,064
and guarantee your job
indefinitely?

866
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:53,367
Mmm...

867
00:37:53,401 --> 00:37:54,601
Okay.

868
00:37:54,636 --> 00:37:56,770
Change of plans, Butt Chin.

869
00:37:56,804 --> 00:37:58,772
I'm gonna take the weekend,

870
00:37:58,806 --> 00:38:02,109
maybe fly down to my condo
in Boca, brown up a bit,

871
00:38:02,143 --> 00:38:04,945
and when I come back,
I will have come up

872
00:38:04,979 --> 00:38:08,015
with some brand-new ways
to destroy you.

873
00:38:10,685 --> 00:38:12,953
(sighs)

874
00:38:25,533 --> 00:38:28,001
(laughing)

875
00:38:28,036 --> 00:38:30,938
Looks like it was another
cutthroat sectionals.

876
00:38:30,972 --> 00:38:34,007
You know, I forgot the way
it smells in here.

877
00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:37,311
All that life-or-death
teen adrenaline, all that drama.

878
00:38:37,345 --> 00:38:39,580
Feels like a million years ago.

879
00:38:39,614 --> 00:38:41,348
Miss it that much, huh?

880
00:38:41,382 --> 00:38:43,817
(laughs) Oh, God, yes.

881
00:38:43,851 --> 00:38:46,853
Give me a medley or a mash-up
or a Broadway tribute,

882
00:38:46,888 --> 00:38:49,022
anything to get me
back up on that stage

883
00:38:49,057 --> 00:38:52,359
with my friends, singing
and dancing for my life.

884
00:38:52,393 --> 00:38:55,462
God, I loved it so much.

885
00:38:55,496 --> 00:38:57,831
But you know what?

886
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:01,301
We got bigger fish
to fry now, Berry.

887
00:39:01,336 --> 00:39:03,670
You, me, the footlights
of Broadway.

888
00:39:03,705 --> 00:39:04,838
I don't know

889
00:39:04,873 --> 00:39:06,473
if you've found an apartment yet

890
00:39:06,507 --> 00:39:09,009
to live in,
in New York, but, uh,

891
00:39:09,043 --> 00:39:11,345
you can always stay at mine
until you find one.

892
00:39:11,379 --> 00:39:14,514
No strings attached, of course.

893
00:39:14,549 --> 00:39:16,049
He said flirtatiously.

894
00:39:17,318 --> 00:39:19,219
I turned down the part,

895
00:39:19,254 --> 00:39:20,554
and I decided

896
00:39:20,588 --> 00:39:22,389
to go back to NYADA.

897
00:39:22,423 --> 00:39:24,558
I think I was afraid that going

898
00:39:24,592 --> 00:39:27,528
back to college would be
a step backwards, but...

899
00:39:29,531 --> 00:39:31,565
I think it's a step
in the right direction.

900
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,000
- Hmm.
- So...

901
00:39:33,034 --> 00:39:34,568
don't be mad.

902
00:39:34,602 --> 00:39:36,470
- You're mad.
- No.

903
00:39:36,504 --> 00:39:38,639
I'm not mad.

904
00:39:38,673 --> 00:39:40,908
Sad that I won't be spending

905
00:39:40,942 --> 00:39:43,243
every night onstage
with Rachel Berry, absolutely,

906
00:39:43,278 --> 00:39:44,878
but I'm proud of you.

907
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:46,480
You went with your gut.

908
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:49,149
You didn't take the easy
road back to Broadway.

909
00:39:49,184 --> 00:39:50,851
And you know what I think?

910
00:39:50,885 --> 00:39:53,387
NYADA better watch out,
'cause the Berry is back.

911
00:39:53,421 --> 00:39:55,923
(chuckles softly)

912
00:39:55,957 --> 00:39:57,324
(sighs)

913
00:39:57,358 --> 00:39:59,426
Thank you so much
for understanding.

914
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,595
And I will be there on
your opening night,

915
00:40:01,629 --> 00:40:03,363
so you better not screw up,
because I'll have an egg

916
00:40:03,398 --> 00:40:05,365
- in my purse with your name on it.
- Oh, wow.

917
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,234
You're really not gonna let me
live that down, are you?

918
00:40:07,268 --> 00:40:08,602
- No.
- Well, maybe I can make it up

919
00:40:08,636 --> 00:40:10,170
to you, because,
you know, you're gonna

920
00:40:10,205 --> 00:40:12,239
be in New York,
and I'm gonna be in New York,

921
00:40:12,273 --> 00:40:13,707
so we're bound to run
into each other.

922
00:40:13,741 --> 00:40:14,942
I mean, we're bound to, yeah.

923
00:40:14,976 --> 00:40:16,877
I mean, I think it's inevitable.

924
00:40:16,911 --> 00:40:19,613
I'd like that.

925
00:40:29,824 --> 00:40:31,625
All right, I'm gonna go.

926
00:40:31,659 --> 00:40:33,660
I'll see you soon.

927
00:40:38,166 --> 00:40:40,267
(school bell ringing)

928
00:40:40,301 --> 00:40:41,635
(whooping and cheering)

929
00:40:41,669 --> 00:40:43,403
All right, the next
first-place trophy

930
00:40:43,438 --> 00:40:44,905
in that case
is gonna be regionals.

931
00:40:44,939 --> 00:40:47,908
(cheering)

932
00:40:47,942 --> 00:40:49,243
You know, someday... five,

933
00:40:49,277 --> 00:40:50,544
ten, 20 years from now...

934
00:40:50,578 --> 00:40:52,212
You're gonna walk
into this school

935
00:40:52,247 --> 00:40:54,248
and you're gonna see the
trophies in that case or...

936
00:40:54,282 --> 00:40:55,716
or maybe you'll be
watching your own

937
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,384
sons and daughters
win their awards,

938
00:40:57,418 --> 00:41:00,654
and I hope you'll remember
this time in your life,

939
00:41:00,688 --> 00:41:02,556
this incredible
moment when a group

940
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:05,325
of very different people
put aside their differences,

941
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,928
supported each other
and formed a team,

942
00:41:07,962 --> 00:41:10,731
and hopefully made
some lifelong friendships.

943
00:41:10,765 --> 00:41:12,499
Now, some of our advisors

944
00:41:12,534 --> 00:41:15,135
are gonna be leaving us,

945
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:17,671
but no matter where we go,
no matter where we are,

946
00:41:17,705 --> 00:41:19,173
we will always be
here in spirit,

947
00:41:19,207 --> 00:41:21,175
and we will always
be supporting you.

948
00:41:21,209 --> 00:41:23,610
Now, a chapter
in Glee Club history

949
00:41:23,645 --> 00:41:27,080
may be ending,
but it is just the beginning

950
00:41:27,115 --> 00:41:29,082
for all of you.

951
00:41:29,117 --> 00:41:30,784
We could not be
more proud of you.

952
00:41:30,819 --> 00:41:32,753
(whooping) Congratulations.

953
00:41:32,787 --> 00:41:35,088
Hey, let's hear it for
Rachel, Mr. Shue, Kurt

954
00:41:35,123 --> 00:41:36,590
and Blaine, everybody.
Oh...

955
00:41:36,624 --> 00:41:39,593
(cheering)

956
00:41:39,627 --> 00:41:42,129
(students murmuring)

957
00:41:51,539 --> 00:41:54,374
You know,
our two little trophies

958
00:41:54,409 --> 00:41:57,644
look really pathetic
in there all by themselves.

959
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:00,547
I vote we get the old ones

960
00:42:00,582 --> 00:42:02,783
and put them back
in there with them.

961
00:42:02,817 --> 00:42:04,918
(others murmuring in agreement)

962
00:42:15,263 --> 00:42:17,831
(laughter)

963
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,575
(cheering)

964
00:42:31,946 --> 00:42:33,680
WILL:
<i>Congratulations, guys.</i>

965
00:42:33,715 --> 00:42:35,716
(cheering)

966
00:42:39,854 --> 00:42:41,622
(cheering and applause)

967
00:42:55,136 --> 00:42:57,805
(applause)
