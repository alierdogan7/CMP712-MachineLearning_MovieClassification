Hi.

338

So what do you do for a living, Steve?

339
00:22:00,135 --> 00:22:01,409
I work in the theatre.

00:22:02,015 --> 00:22:05,485
- Would we have seen you in anything?
- I doubt it. I'm the manager.

341

- Which theatre's that, then?
- The Theatre Royal.

That must be quite a big responsibility.

into something like that, Steve?

Scruffy bastard.

500
00:33:58,535 --> 00:34:00,412
So, what's the arcade chap like?

501
00:34:00,815 --> 00:34:02,885
- A prick.
- A guilty prick?

502
00:34:03,255 --> 00:34:06,372
A prick has no conscience.
Didn't your father tell you anything?

503
00:34:06,655 --> 00:34:08,964
His story seems a little unlikely.

504
00:34:09,655 --> 00:34:13,170

makes our police force enviable.

- I'll start with Ripley's wife.

00:34:27,095 --> 00:34:29,563

510
00:34:29,655 --> 00:34:33,330
Dead as Southport he was. Six feet
from the kiddies rides. How sick is that?

511
00:34:33,415 --> 00:34:35,883
That is awful. Who was he?

512
00:34:36,655 --> 00:34:39,647
I don't know. Neither do the police.
Some deadbeat or other.

513
00:34:39,735 --> 00:34:41,248
It'd be a deadbeat. That's right.

514
00:34:41,335 --> 00:34:44,054
- I've had to close the arcade.
- How long for?

515

about. I could tell you didn't like him.

a few problems about the age difference

531

Isn't that something
to get excited about?

544
00:36:28,295 --> 00:36:29,648
I suppose.

he was to finish with you.

- Quite a coincidence though, isn't it?
- What's that?

553
00:37:06,335 --> 00:37:10,044
You meet him, you don't like him, and
the next day he finishes with Shyanne.

554
00:37:10,255 --> 00:37:13,008
Yeah, that's why it's called coincidence,
I suppose.

555
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:15,445
I didn't know you believed
in coincidence.

556
00:37:15,855 --> 00:37:19,404

Of course, I believe in coincidence.

for this Promenade site when it came up.

So he were dumped here?

Well, you see, I attract a lot of jealousy.

00:46:46,055 --> 00:46:47,693
Yeah, I did. I did.

663
00:46:49,335 --> 00:46:54,204
But I'm not quite sure why.
I just saw the door and the sign.

664
00:46:54,695 --> 00:46:57,767
- Just had to ring the bell.
- Exactly.

665
00:46:58,655 --> 00:47:02,807
Yeah, I played a lot of knock and run
as a child. Sometimes I regress.

666
00:47:03,775 --> 00:47:04,969
I see.

667
00:47:05,295 --> 00:47:09,174
Okay. Well, I've got phones
to answer, so...

668
00:47:10,375 --> 00:47:13,606
So, do you work here, then?

669
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,888
I'm a volunteer, yeah.

670
00:47:19,095 --> 00:47:21,893
And you'll just talk to anyone
who comes in off the street?

671
00:47:21,975 --> 00:47:24,125
Yeah. That's the general idea.

672
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:26,003
Even me?

673
00:47:28,135 --> 00:47:29,614
Even you, yeah.

674
00:47:32,135 --> 00:47:35,923
Listen, do you want to come inside and
we can talk about what's troubling you?

675
00:47:36,575 --> 00:47:38,770
What makes you think
anything's troubling me?

676
00:47:39,135 --> 00:47:41,410
Well, you don't seem to be able
to walk away.

677
00:47:42,055 --> 00:47:46,924
If you did want to talk about something,
you might at least want to come inside.

678
00:48:01,815 --> 00:48:03,009
Are you depressed?

679
00:48:03,575 --> 00:48:07,409
Erm, not yet, but I've only been here
a couple of days.

680
00:48:08,575 --> 00:48:09,724
I have a question.

681
00:48:10,455 --> 00:48:14,004
I can't work out
why anyone would do this.

682
00:48:14,615 --> 00:48:17,527
- Why do you say that?
- So you're not going to answer me, then?

683
00:48:18,655 --> 00:48:21,931
- We're not here to talk about me.
- No, but I'd like to.

684
00:48:22,455 --> 00:48:23,524
Why?

685
00:48:23,615 --> 00:48:26,732
There you go again. Evasive.
You're very good at that, aren't you?

686
00:48:27,895 --> 00:48:32,366
Why are you trying to trick me
into talking about myself all the time?

687
00:48:32,455 --> 00:48:35,686
Come on, just tell me why you do this
and then I'll open up.

688
00:48:37,255 --> 00:48:40,133
- I'm nosy.
- You're very fortunate.

689
00:48:40,215 --> 00:48:42,934
Not everyone can turn their vices
into charitable works.

690
00:48:46,895 --> 00:48:49,011
I hadn't really seen it like that before.

691
00:48:49,255 --> 00:48:51,450
Would you like to go out
for a drink with me?

692
00:48:54,935 --> 00:48:58,052
It's not possible.
It's not what I'm here for.

693
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:01,332
But if I was to bump into you
in the street and ask you out then...

694
00:49:01,415 --> 00:49:02,643
what would you say?

695
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:05,043
I'd say...

696
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,448
"Thank you very much...

697
00:49:10,695 --> 00:49:12,811
- "but I'm married."
- But not happily.

698
00:49:14,095 --> 00:49:17,485
- Because you're not happy, are you?
- That's none of your business.

699
00:49:17,575 --> 00:49:19,167
And that's why you do this

700
00:49:19,255 --> 00:49:22,247
because if you listen to people
who are unhappier than you,

701
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:24,974
it makes the pain seem that bit easier,
doesn't it?

702
00:49:25,655 --> 00:49:27,134
Doesn't it occur to you...

703
00:49:27,935 --> 00:49:30,813
that there might be somebody
who wants to talk to me

704
00:49:30,895 --> 00:49:34,808
- who really does need my time?
- How do you know that isn't me?

705
00:49:35,935 --> 00:49:38,529
Well, I hope you got what you came for.

706
00:49:41,815 --> 00:49:42,930
What?

707
00:49:43,695 --> 00:49:45,413
You're just not what I'd imagined.

What's this doing up?

713
00:50:26,335 --> 00:50:27,609
He's our main suspect.

714
00:50:28,815 --> 00:50:31,375
You're coming at this
a bit sideways, aren't you, son?

715
00:50:31,455 --> 00:50:33,764
- I thought he found the body.
- He did.

716
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:37,609
And it turns out the victim died on the
night the arcade had its opening party.

717
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:39,287
So that rules him in, not out.

718
00:50:39,375 --> 00:50:42,811
You should have come to me first.
I was at the party.

719
00:50:43,175 --> 00:50:44,927
Ripley was with me all night.

720
00:50:45,095 --> 00:50:49,885
Of course. You're Ripley Holden's friend.
I thought that name rang a bell.

721
00:50:49,975 --> 00:50:51,124
That's right.

722
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:54,730
So what were you doing on the night
in question, as the cliche goes?

723
00:50:55,055 --> 00:50:56,886
We were just out and about, you know.

724
00:50:58,415 --> 00:51:02,294
- I'm going to need more than that.
- It was a lad's night out.

725
00:51:02,815 --> 00:51:05,534
Am I to understand
you were pursuing romantic liaisons

726
00:51:05,615 --> 00:51:07,571
with members of the opposite sex, sir?

727
00:51:07,655 --> 00:51:10,852
Nothing hardcore. Just a bit of fun.

728
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,727
You wouldn't find a more devoted father
than Ripley Holden.

729
00:51:15,295 --> 00:51:17,411
Devoted to what, exactly?

730
00:51:19,775 --> 00:51:22,608
I hope you're not trying
to make a name for yourself, son.

731
00:51:25,975 --> 00:51:28,011
Thanks for the alibi, Jim.

732
00:51:31,135 --> 00:51:34,491
Holden seems to have borrowed money
from every businessman in town

733
00:51:34,575 --> 00:51:35,803
to do the arcade up.

734
00:51:35,895 --> 00:51:38,614
It's funny, he doesn't strike me
as the trustworthy type.

I trust you aren't questioning
my methodology, Blythe?

738
00:51:53,335 --> 00:51:56,884
- I wasn't aware you had a methodology.
- You stay there, then.

739
00:52:23,295 --> 00:52:24,444
Would you look at that?

740
00:52:24,535 --> 00:52:29,165
Nudge? Hi-Lo? Take Feature?
Am I supposed to be this confused?

741
00:52:30,855 --> 00:52:33,892
If you save your nudges,
you can get up one of the trails.

742
00:52:33,975 --> 00:52:35,727
Then you get into the feature tower.

00:52:45,615 --> 00:52:47,924

00:52:49,655 --> 00:52:50,644
There.

That's great. I don't have a clue how
I did it but that's great.

Mate of mine grew up in Blackpool.

750
00:52:58,415 --> 00:53:01,327
This was years ago now.
Said he hated being a local.

751
00:53:01,415 --> 00:53:02,689
- You know why?
- Why?

752
00:53:03,255 --> 00:53:05,689
Because if it wasn't
pissed-up Geordie week,

753
00:53:05,775 --> 00:53:08,164
it was pissed-up Glasgow week.

754
00:53:08,255 --> 00:53:10,450
And if it wasn't Mancs,
it was the Scousers.

755
00:53:10,535 --> 00:53:13,686
And they all wanted to do one thing.
Beat up the locals.

756
00:53:15,215 --> 00:53:17,445
- Nothing changes.
- Yeah, I'll bet.

757
00:53:17,615 --> 00:53:21,130
So, did you see this man in any fights
the other night?

758
00:53:23,255 --> 00:53:24,529
No.

759
00:53:24,615 --> 00:53:29,484
Are you sure?
Because we've got you and him on CCTV

760
00:53:29,575 --> 00:53:32,806
going into Romeo's
within ten minutes of each other.

761
00:53:32,895 --> 00:53:36,285
I didn't see him there.
I never saw him after he left this place.

762
00:53:37,455 --> 00:53:38,570
He was here?

763
00:53:40,455 --> 00:53:42,810
At the arcade opening night?
Are you sure?

764
00:53:43,135 --> 00:53:46,445
Of course I'm sure. You could hardly
miss hair like that, could you?

765
00:53:46,535 --> 00:53:50,448
Okay, Braveheart.
What do you think you're doing?

where science ends and luck begins.

You're talking to my son. He's a minor.

768
00:53:57,495 --> 00:54:00,373
You don't talk to my son
without me being there, understand?

769
00:54:00,455 --> 00:54:02,491
Okay. I'll just collect my winnings.

770
00:54:08,415 --> 00:54:11,373
Mr Holden, just one question
and I'll be gone.

771
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:14,492
- What do you want to know?
- What's an AWP?

Sounds a bit like life itself, doesn't it?

00:54:27,215 --> 00:54:29,683
And you are absolutely sure

776
00:54:30,175 --> 00:54:32,735
you didn't see him here
at your opening night party?

777
00:54:32,855 --> 00:54:35,130
Absolutely. You know why?

778
00:54:35,215 --> 00:54:38,412
Because he wasn't here that night.
Now, are you sure of your way out?
