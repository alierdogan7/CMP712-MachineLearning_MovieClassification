1
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,788
Credits.

2
00:02:41,855 --> 00:02:45,533
The credits will be superimposed over...

3
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,178
1. The city of Buenos Aires
on a winter morning.

4
00:02:49,248 --> 00:02:52,314
The sun rises over the Rio de la Plata...

5
00:02:52,384 --> 00:02:54,522
lighting up Buenos Aires.

6
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,439
2. Mario's apartment.

7
00:02:58,496 --> 00:03:01,845
He lives on the top floor
of an old building...

8
00:03:01,951 --> 00:03:05,247
that is still a distinguished
central address.

9
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:08,606
The furnishings are quietly modern...

10
00:03:08,671 --> 00:03:11,967
parquet floors, simple furniture,
functional lighting.

11
00:03:13,056 --> 00:03:17,017
Who is Mario Suarez,
the hero of our story?

12
00:03:17,088 --> 00:03:20,885
That's not as important
as what happens to him...

13
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,895
and what he does.

14
00:03:26,303 --> 00:03:29,882
We hear a woman singing
the first notes of a tango.

15
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,640
Mario is pensive.

16
00:03:39,456 --> 00:03:43,580
¢Ü Life is so strange, friend

17
00:03:43,648 --> 00:03:47,904
¢Ü I didn't love her
when I met her

18
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:52,159
¢Ü Until one night
she firmly said to me

19
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:56,217
¢Ü "I'm tired of everything"
and left

20
00:03:57,344 --> 00:04:01,022
¢Ü Life is so strange, friend

21
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,981
¢Ü That night
I fell in love with her

22
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,996
¢Ü I sacrificed so much
trying to forget her

23
00:04:11,104 --> 00:04:12,991
¢Ü partied my life away

24
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:15,609
¢Ü All over town

25
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,153
¢Ü How could I know
that her affection

26
00:04:20,224 --> 00:04:23,606
¢Ü Would cause me all the troubles
that it did

27
00:04:24,704 --> 00:04:28,480
¢Ü I wasted my life in bars

28
00:04:28,545 --> 00:04:32,537
¢Ü So they'd all see
I'd forgotten her

29
00:04:33,568 --> 00:04:35,673
¢Ü But that was a lie

30
00:04:35,744 --> 00:04:37,784
¢Ü And when I was alone

31
00:04:37,888 --> 00:04:41,718
¢Ü I cried like a woman, my friend

32
00:04:51,455 --> 00:04:55,711
¢Ü 2 whole years we were together

33
00:04:55,777 --> 00:04:59,355
¢Ü I never dreamt
that I'd fall for her

34
00:05:00,512 --> 00:05:04,855
¢Ü How could I know
that she'd bewitch me

35
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:08,637
¢Ü That I'd do anything
to see her again

36
00:05:09,664 --> 00:05:13,593
¢Ü Life is so strange, friend

37
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,757
¢Ü That was the night
I fell in love with her

38
00:09:50,785 --> 00:09:53,086
I didn't know you were here.

39
00:09:54,465 --> 00:09:56,319
I came for my necklace.

40
00:09:56,385 --> 00:09:59,581
- Why did you come, Laura?
- I told you.

41
00:09:59,648 --> 00:10:01,984
For the necklace.

42
00:10:03,617 --> 00:10:05,853
The keys...

43
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,158
I found them among my things.

44
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,664
Can we talk, Laura?

45
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,558
What about?

46
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,698
Us.

47
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:23,103
You and me.

48
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:24,957
Haven't we said it all?

49
00:10:26,273 --> 00:10:28,445
I can't live this way.

50
00:10:29,602 --> 00:10:31,805
You're everywhere, Laura.

51
00:10:31,873 --> 00:10:33,979
I miss you.

52
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,343
Come back.

53
00:10:37,729 --> 00:10:40,577
Mario, let's not start again.

54
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:42,528
You don't understand.

55
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:49,303
Hug me.

56
00:10:52,513 --> 00:10:53,724
Like that.

57
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:56,182
- No!
- Please hug me.

58
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,623
Please, I want to. Kiss me!

59
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,315
Let go of me!

60
00:11:01,473 --> 00:11:02,968
You're hurting me!

61
00:11:03,073 --> 00:11:04,698
Let go!

62
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:12,828
I'm living with another man!
I'm happy!

63
00:11:12,898 --> 00:11:14,872
Is he a better lay?

64
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,565
Don't be crude!

65
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:43,649
Hi, Mr. Mario.

66
00:11:43,714 --> 00:11:46,975
- How's everything going?
- Just fine.

67
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,928
I'm moving into the studio.

68
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:51,808
I'll need a mattress,
hi-fi and video...

69
00:11:51,873 --> 00:11:54,044
a few chairs, a table.

70
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,217
- Can you handle it?
- Leave it to me.

71
00:11:56,288 --> 00:11:59,039
- When are you moving in?
- Tomorrow.

72
00:12:00,673 --> 00:12:02,560
- How's your leg?
- Much better.

73
00:12:02,657 --> 00:12:04,545
In a few days, I won't need this.

74
00:12:04,642 --> 00:12:08,024
- It was a miracle!
- I feel asleep.

75
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:12,701
I wasn't drunk or on drugs,
as they said. I was exhausted.

76
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:16,731
All I remember is
a truck coming at me.

77
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:21,685
They say your whole life flashes by.

78
00:12:21,793 --> 00:12:25,055
You see too many movies.
Didn't happen.

79
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:28,799
I woke up in a hospital
with a broken leg.

80
00:12:28,866 --> 00:12:32,094
It could have been worse.

81
00:12:32,162 --> 00:12:33,655
Maybe.

82
00:12:57,153 --> 00:12:59,008
Mr. Mario, you don't know me.

83
00:12:59,073 --> 00:13:01,277
I'm a pro at this.

84
00:13:02,401 --> 00:13:05,467
I'm very good.
The best of the Guardia Vieja.

85
00:13:05,537 --> 00:13:07,293
Where's Fuentes?

86
00:13:07,361 --> 00:13:09,085
Back to your place.

87
00:13:10,018 --> 00:13:11,905
They're calling us.

88
00:13:11,969 --> 00:13:13,857
Don't forget us.

89
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,530
"The Creole Waltz", Maestro!

90
00:14:52,257 --> 00:14:53,534
Mario.

91
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:56,985
Everything's ready for a rehearsal.

92
00:15:04,385 --> 00:15:06,077
- Hi, Mario.
- Waldo.

93
00:15:06,146 --> 00:15:08,895
- How's the leg?
- I'm ready to dance.

94
00:15:10,051 --> 00:15:11,905
How do you like the place?

95
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,908
I like it.

96
00:15:14,978 --> 00:15:16,866
I'll leave you with Andres.

97
00:15:16,961 --> 00:15:19,678
If you need me,
I'll be in the workshop.

98
00:15:21,313 --> 00:15:23,485
Let's have the slides.

99
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:27,937
Left side.

100
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:33,976
Right side.

101
00:15:38,658 --> 00:15:40,927
- Be right with you.
- I'll come back.

102
00:15:40,994 --> 00:15:42,882
No, tell me.

103
00:15:42,946 --> 00:15:47,037
I've thought about our talk
on t103he lighting.

104
00:15:47,106 --> 00:15:49,146
I think I get it.

105
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,025
You want to use color
to tr106avel in time.

106
00:15:55,651 --> 00:15:58,171
And use light to show
our hero's passage...

107
00:15:58,242 --> 00:16:01,439
from outer light
to inner darkness.

108
00:16:01,507 --> 00:16:02,587
That's it.

109
00:16:17,506 --> 00:16:19,360
How are the rehearsals?

110
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:21,117
Lmproving.

111
00:16:21,186 --> 00:16:24,763
I hear you're complicating
the show, adding slides...

112
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:28,664
a wind machine, new dances
and lots of other gimmicks.

113
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,388
- Who told you?
- Never mind.

114
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,117
You've got good spies.

115
00:16:34,178 --> 00:16:37,855
I'm looking for links
to give it unity.

116
00:16:37,922 --> 00:16:40,857
Sure. We're using new materials...

117
00:16:40,962 --> 00:16:42,871
textures from abroad...

118
00:16:42,978 --> 00:16:44,472
It's interesting.

119
00:16:45,761 --> 00:16:47,802
I have no idea
how it'll come out.

120
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:50,591
Listen to me for once!

121
00:16:50,658 --> 00:16:52,993
Don't complicate things.

122
00:16:53,058 --> 00:16:56,189
Today, audiences want simple things.

123
00:16:56,258 --> 00:17:00,252
They're used to TV,
everything predigested.

124
00:17:00,323 --> 00:17:02,264
They want pure entertainment...

125
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:05,502
no moralizing, no politics,
no heavy thoughts.

126
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:09,083
The similar it is,
the happier they are!

127
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:12,254
I talked to them.

128
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,209
- Really.
- We had a meeting and...

129
00:17:14,306 --> 00:17:16,672
- nd?
- They want a good show...

130
00:17:16,738 --> 00:17:20,000
and they'll do anything
you want, but...

131
00:17:21,218 --> 00:17:23,770
- But?
- Think of other people.

132
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:26,908
Especially the investors.

133
00:17:26,978 --> 00:17:30,044
If they don't like me,
they can fire me.

134
00:17:30,114 --> 00:17:32,416
Don't be so arrogant!

135
00:17:32,482 --> 00:17:33,759
That's not it.

136
00:17:33,827 --> 00:17:36,608
If they don't trust me...

137
00:17:36,674 --> 00:17:38,397
I'll quit.

138
00:17:38,466 --> 00:17:41,848
Don't dramatize! They trust you!

139
00:17:41,954 --> 00:17:43,897
That's why they hired you.

140
00:17:44,003 --> 00:17:47,482
But they want a simple show
with no headaches.

141
00:17:47,554 --> 00:17:51,417
They've got their problems,
I've go mine.

142
00:17:51,522 --> 00:17:55,580
But I won't put up with interference!

143
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,593
- As usual.
- As usual.

144
00:17:57,698 --> 00:17:59,259
Fuck it!

145
00:18:07,394 --> 00:18:10,656
Tonight is a special night...

146
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,023
because here among us are...

147
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:17,182
dear friends who came
to keep us company.

148
00:18:17,251 --> 00:18:20,120
Like Maestro...

149
00:18:20,226 --> 00:18:21,916
Carlos Nebbia!

150
00:18:21,985 --> 00:18:24,158
Give him a big hand!

151
00:18:32,802 --> 00:18:37,504
We'll impose on
our distinguished guest

152
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:40,766
and ask him to delight us
with a tango!

153
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,329
Go, Maestro!

154
00:22:04,579 --> 00:22:07,678
Next, in this emotion-filled night

155
00:22:07,747 --> 00:22:10,681
we hear this unique orchestra

156
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:13,656
playing a milonga!

157
00:22:15,396 --> 00:22:17,729
- How are you doing?
- Not as well as you.

158
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:19,769
Don't exaggerate.

159
00:22:19,874 --> 00:22:22,558
I'm Angel Larroca,
the owner of this place.

160
00:22:22,627 --> 00:22:24,830
Angelo to my friends.

161
00:22:24,899 --> 00:22:26,721
- Maestro Stein.
- Delighted.

162
00:22:26,787 --> 00:22:28,892
- Mario Suarez.
- Delighted.

163
00:22:28,963 --> 00:22:32,956
It's a real honor for us
to have you here.

164
00:22:33,027 --> 00:22:35,548
May I take a moment of your time?

165
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,244
I'd like to talk to you.

166
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:40,664
- Now?
- I'd be grateful.

167
00:22:40,771 --> 00:22:44,546
Let's go to my table.
We'll have more privacy.

168
00:22:44,643 --> 00:22:46,138
Be careful.

169
00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:49,983
- Allow me.
- I'm okay, thanks.

170
00:22:51,939 --> 00:22:53,533
See you later.

171
00:22:56,002 --> 00:22:58,752
The guy's dangerous.

172
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,128
What can I do for you?

173
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:08,188
I'm not quite sure how to put it.

174
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:11,417
Anyway...

175
00:23:11,522 --> 00:23:14,272
my life is all set up.

176
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:18,234
Business is fine,
and I've got money.

177
00:23:18,339 --> 00:23:20,859
This place is just a whim for me.

178
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:26,975
Are you aware that I own
50% of your show?

179
00:23:28,003 --> 00:23:31,233
- I put up the money.
- What about Alex and Fontan?

180
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,950
They're in on it too.

181
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:36,866
But as I told you, I'm in control.

182
00:23:38,308 --> 00:23:40,642
Don't look so glum.

183
00:23:40,707 --> 00:23:43,554
- I didn't realize that.
- I'm not your enemy.

184
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:47,258
I'm a big fan of your work.

185
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:49,752
What I'm going to ask you...

186
00:23:49,827 --> 00:23:51,715
is perfectly normal.

187
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:54,873
I'm in love with a girl.

188
00:23:54,979 --> 00:23:57,500
She's wild about dancing.

189
00:23:57,572 --> 00:23:59,481
I think she's talented.

190
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,649
I'd give my life for her.

191
00:24:02,755 --> 00:24:04,927
You understand me?

192
00:24:05,956 --> 00:24:07,165
Of course.

193
00:24:09,796 --> 00:24:11,257
That's her, over there...

194
00:24:11,364 --> 00:24:13,535
dancing with the old man.

195
00:24:15,267 --> 00:24:16,761
He's my father.

196
00:24:18,468 --> 00:24:21,118
Your father's a pro.

197
00:24:21,187 --> 00:24:23,609
Let's say, as good as one.

198
00:24:24,676 --> 00:24:27,872
But I didn't inherit his talent.

199
00:24:32,227 --> 00:24:34,594
All I'm asking for is...

200
00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:36,602
an audition for her.

201
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,562
No favoritism.

202
00:24:40,164 --> 00:24:42,619
I won't put any pressure on you.

203
00:24:45,091 --> 00:24:46,716
It's a deal.

204
00:24:46,787 --> 00:24:49,821
She can come by the studio
at 11: 00 a.m. Tomorrow.

205
00:25:05,731 --> 00:25:08,153
Let's do the same as yesterday.

206
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,129
Separate the men and the women.

207
00:25:11,235 --> 00:25:13,505
The women, this side, OK?

208
00:25:14,531 --> 00:25:16,670
- Later they'll mingle.
- OK. Can I start?

209
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,779
Yes, and don't stop.

210
00:25:19,907 --> 00:25:22,046
Hello. How are you?

211
00:25:22,115 --> 00:25:25,115
To your places.
Girls on this side.

212
00:25:25,188 --> 00:25:26,780
Boys on that side.

213
00:25:26,852 --> 00:25:29,753
We'll do a basic eight-beat step.

214
00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:33,438
Ready, Maestro?
Five, six, seven, eight...

215
00:25:49,251 --> 00:25:51,672
Very good.
The eight in 16 beats.

216
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:54,082
Five, six, seven, eight...

217
00:26:17,091 --> 00:26:19,360
A double sentada in 16 beats.

218
00:26:39,204 --> 00:26:40,764
Sentada!

219
00:26:52,228 --> 00:26:56,570
Lmagine you're holding a boy
in your arms. You too!

220
00:26:56,675 --> 00:27:00,353
Girls, put some joy into it!
Some love, some spice!

221
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,590
A double hook, in 16 beats.

222
00:27:21,379 --> 00:27:22,875
Very good.

223
00:27:24,356 --> 00:27:26,211
Now we'll do...

224
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:29,057
the double hook...

225
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,618
then the parada.

226
00:27:30,724 --> 00:27:33,178
First the voleo in eight beats.

227
00:27:42,756 --> 00:27:44,993
Now the parada in 16.

228
00:28:02,436 --> 00:28:04,191
Form a circle.

229
00:28:05,219 --> 00:28:06,975
Now we'll do...

230
00:28:07,043 --> 00:28:09,913
Move counterclockwise.

231
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:12,573
Now we'll practice...

232
00:28:12,644 --> 00:28:14,684
the basic step...

233
00:28:14,757 --> 00:28:16,796
the double hook...

234
00:28:16,868 --> 00:28:20,163
the voleo, the parada...

235
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,108
and the finale in 16 beats.

236
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,616
Make the girls sit more.

237
00:28:37,124 --> 00:28:40,191
I want to see one body
with four legs!

238
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:42,115
Let's see some joy!

239
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,728
- What do you think?
- Brilliant!

240
00:29:24,837 --> 00:29:26,047
He's marvelous!

241
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,397
We've found a clip of Tita Merello.

242
00:29:30,467 --> 00:29:32,923
- And Mercedes Simone?
- We're trying.

243
00:29:32,996 --> 00:29:35,385
The little there is
in bad shape.

244
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:39,289
The best we found on her
is a movie from 1932 or 1933.

245
00:29:39,396 --> 00:29:41,251
Called Tango.

246
00:29:43,108 --> 00:29:45,628
- You've seen it?
- Sure.

247
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,417
It had Tita Merello,
Libertad Lamarque...

248
00:29:48,483 --> 00:29:50,458
Azucena Maizani and Simone.

249
00:29:50,565 --> 00:29:52,124
What a foursome!

250
00:29:52,196 --> 00:29:54,051
What a cast!

251
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,156
See you in five minutes.

252
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:00,643
I'll be in the shop.

253
00:31:44,548 --> 00:31:46,720
- Fine.
- Do you like it?

254
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:48,893
Some things need fixing...

255
00:31:48,964 --> 00:31:50,459
What?

256
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:54,082
- How are you?
- Fine.

257
00:31:55,812 --> 00:31:57,786
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

258
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:02,043
Laura, can I talk to you?

259
00:32:19,046 --> 00:32:21,314
Forgive me?

260
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,280
I don't know what came over me.

261
00:32:27,877 --> 00:32:31,172
You know I couldn't harm anyone.

262
00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:32,763
I don't know.

263
00:32:35,332 --> 00:32:37,503
It'll never happen again.
I swear it!

264
00:32:38,308 --> 00:32:40,893
All right. It's forgotten.

265
00:32:45,093 --> 00:32:46,980
What you're doing is fabulous!

266
00:32:48,645 --> 00:32:51,492
- Really?
- Fabulous!

267
00:32:51,589 --> 00:32:53,084
Thanks.

268
00:32:54,148 --> 00:32:55,807
Mario, excuse me.

269
00:32:55,877 --> 00:32:58,779
I want to take a shower.
I'm tired.

270
00:33:13,284 --> 00:33:15,389
He wants to dance with you.

271
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,827
- No, with you.
- No, you!

272
00:33:17,892 --> 00:33:20,260
- I don't dare.
- No, go on!

273
00:33:33,604 --> 00:33:35,459
Not bad.

274
00:34:04,164 --> 00:34:07,034
Very good. You've gotten better.

275
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,643
Don't overdo it.

276
00:34:42,117 --> 00:34:44,091
That's enough. Thanks.

277
00:35:00,357 --> 00:35:03,455
Where do you get all that energy?

278
00:35:03,524 --> 00:35:06,721
- You joking?
- It's impressive.

279
00:35:06,789 --> 00:35:08,960
It's my whole life.

280
00:35:09,028 --> 00:35:10,621
My passion!

281
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:13,922
Good rehearsal.
What about the girl?

282
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:16,355
She's very good.

283
00:35:16,452 --> 00:35:19,268
How long to train her for a lead?

284
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:22,628
You want her to dance a lead?

285
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:25,444
You like her?

286
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,955
We'll go all out.

287
00:35:40,421 --> 00:35:42,331
I'm Elena Flores.

288
00:35:42,437 --> 00:35:44,543
Thank you for taking me.

289
00:35:44,613 --> 00:35:47,515
It's a real pleasure
wor291king with you all.

290
00:35:47,622 --> 00:35:49,923
I saw you dance with the Maestro.

291
00:35:49,989 --> 00:35:52,356
He's not easy to follow.

292
00:35:52,453 --> 00:35:55,584
- It was very good.
- Thanks.

293
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,403
I hope I don't let you down.

294
00:35:58,469 --> 00:35:59,964
Welcome.

295
00:36:00,069 --> 00:36:02,141
See you. Bye.

296
00:36:07,557 --> 00:36:10,372
Lend me your cane.
Hold onto me.

297
00:36:11,397 --> 00:36:13,285
And bend down. Look...

298
00:36:13,382 --> 00:36:16,251
the floor rises here.

299
00:36:17,605 --> 00:36:20,474
So when the immigrants advance...

300
00:36:20,581 --> 00:36:23,680
we don't see them at first.

301
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:26,018
- The ramp.
- Sure, on the ramp.

302
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:28,802
All you'll see is the sky...

303
00:36:28,868 --> 00:36:30,527
and the horizon.

304
00:36:30,597 --> 00:36:32,986
The sun starts to rise. It's dawn.

305
00:36:34,053 --> 00:36:37,283
Then gradually, heads appear.

306
00:36:38,437 --> 00:36:39,866
Whole families.

307
00:36:39,973 --> 00:36:43,202
Men, women, children,
young and old.

308
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:44,414
All dressed...

309
00:36:44,485 --> 00:36:48,741
in turn-of-the-century clothes.

310
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:51,194
They carry suitcases, bundles.

311
00:36:51,301 --> 00:36:54,683
Maybe a man carrying
his kid piggyback.

312
00:36:57,029 --> 00:36:58,917
What do you think?

313
00:36:59,014 --> 00:37:00,868
Nice image, yes.

314
00:37:02,694 --> 00:37:05,727
We start with a static shot...

315
00:37:05,797 --> 00:37:08,318
using the whole set.

316
00:37:09,445 --> 00:37:12,227
You want props orjust a backdrop?

317
00:37:12,325 --> 00:37:14,267
Or plastic frames?

318
00:37:14,341 --> 00:37:17,375
A backdrop with a Rosco mural.

319
00:37:17,446 --> 00:37:20,511
The images will vary
with the lighting.

320
00:37:20,581 --> 00:37:22,883
Front or back lit.

321
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:25,502
The light can keep changing...

322
00:37:25,573 --> 00:37:27,428
from dawn to dusk.

323
00:37:28,485 --> 00:37:30,906
The light will symbolize...

324
00:37:31,013 --> 00:37:33,347
exile through the ages.

325
00:37:33,413 --> 00:37:35,388
What do you say?

326
00:37:35,494 --> 00:37:37,435
Great!

327
00:37:37,541 --> 00:37:40,324
Now we have to make it all move.

328
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,146
I have some ideas.

329
00:37:42,214 --> 00:37:44,123
Still a bit fuzzy.

330
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,978
And?

331
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:50,079
- I have until?
- Tomorrow, Carlos.

332
00:37:52,453 --> 00:37:55,105
- And the music?
- A tango.

333
00:38:42,437 --> 00:38:46,432
Agri has such a sensitivity.
A virtuoso.

334
00:38:48,325 --> 00:38:50,267
De Lio always looks so absent.

335
00:38:58,278 --> 00:39:01,277
Look at Salgan... 81 years old.

336
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:04,132
Eighty-one? Incredible!

337
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:04,351
My most vivid memory
of this school...

338
00:41:04,422 --> 00:41:08,700
is of Don Leandro Garcia Echenique,
my teacher.

339
00:41:08,774 --> 00:41:12,189
A Spanish Civil War refugee.

340
00:41:12,293 --> 00:41:15,425
He taught me to love poetry.

341
00:41:16,709 --> 00:41:19,099
A stern man, very brusque...

342
00:41:19,206 --> 00:41:21,988
but so affectionate.

343
00:41:22,054 --> 00:41:25,633
He started classes with
"Long Live the Republic!"

344
00:41:25,702 --> 00:41:27,196
"Be seated."

345
00:41:28,741 --> 00:41:31,108
I went to the French school.

346
00:41:31,173 --> 00:41:33,541
My father was a concert violinist.

347
00:41:33,638 --> 00:41:36,507
He taught me theory and notation.

348
00:41:36,614 --> 00:41:38,239
Did you like that?

349
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:42,052
Yes. Family tradition mattered to us.

350
00:41:42,118 --> 00:41:44,158
Granddad was a musician.

351
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:48,092
And Dad thought he had
a boy genius under his roof.

352
00:41:49,158 --> 00:41:51,875
Turns out he was right.

353
00:41:53,158 --> 00:41:56,453
Only a few small mammals
coexisted with them.

354
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:59,452
Mankind appeared much later...

355
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:02,848
when the dinosaurs disappeared...

356
00:42:02,918 --> 00:42:04,805
mysteriously from the planet.

357
00:42:04,902 --> 00:42:09,058
Gradually, the mammals
spread over the earth.

358
00:42:10,311 --> 00:42:11,805
Mario!

359
00:42:13,254 --> 00:42:15,588
What's the subject?

360
00:42:15,654 --> 00:42:17,989
You're talking about...

361
00:42:18,054 --> 00:42:20,126
You're so distracted.

362
00:42:20,198 --> 00:42:22,565
This can't go on.

363
00:42:22,662 --> 00:42:27,168
I was saying that when
the dinosaurs reigned...

364
00:43:02,887 --> 00:43:04,959
What do you think?

365
00:43:05,031 --> 00:43:06,524
It's very good.

366
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:10,720
You need patience to teach them.

367
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:14,019
Yes. Few children move in harmony.

368
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:18,656
They're still green,
can't control their bodies.

369
00:43:18,725 --> 00:43:20,831
Look...

370
00:43:20,902 --> 00:43:22,757
the little couple there.

371
00:43:22,822 --> 00:43:26,782
The girl has a feeling
for rhythm and dancing.

372
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,538
But he's an oaf.

373
00:43:29,606 --> 00:43:31,711
He can't be taught.

374
00:43:31,782 --> 00:43:35,078
Yet she'll only dance with him.

375
00:43:35,174 --> 00:43:38,207
That's how great loves
are born, eh?

376
00:43:38,278 --> 00:43:40,067
You said it.

377
00:43:44,486 --> 00:43:46,428
I used to dance too.

378
00:43:46,533 --> 00:43:48,902
- You danced?
- And how!

379
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:52,768
But I've no partner now.

380
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:56,667
My wife died last year.

381
00:43:56,774 --> 00:43:59,391
Life has no meaning for me now.

382
00:44:03,078 --> 00:44:06,691
The girl putting on her shoes
is my granddaughter.

383
00:44:23,366 --> 00:44:25,822
Anita has dancing in her blood.

384
00:44:27,014 --> 00:44:30,309
They say musical sense
is hereditary.

385
00:44:30,406 --> 00:44:32,317
Who knows?

386
00:44:32,423 --> 00:44:34,211
Still...

387
00:44:34,278 --> 00:44:37,409
the girl dances as well
as her grandfather.

388
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:29,661
Don't stop, kids.

389
00:45:29,767 --> 00:45:33,312
The group... faces in profile.

390
00:45:33,382 --> 00:45:36,863
Hands down close at your sides.

391
00:45:36,935 --> 00:45:38,363
Julio?

392
00:45:38,471 --> 00:45:42,497
Neither group should mix
with the other...

393
00:45:42,568 --> 00:45:44,706
before the fusion point.

394
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:46,530
- Okay.
- Bon't forget...

395
00:45:46,598 --> 00:45:49,349
half the floor will be black,
half white.

396
00:45:49,415 --> 00:45:52,481
- You want them further apart.
- A bit.

397
00:45:55,623 --> 00:45:58,917
Okay, farther apart.
We'll start again.

398
00:47:55,143 --> 00:47:57,030
Don't look at the floor.

399
00:48:12,295 --> 00:48:14,880
Be careful. Don't be nervous.

400
00:48:19,047 --> 00:48:20,902
You're both too far ahead.

401
00:48:59,175 --> 00:49:00,799
How's it going?

402
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:03,621
- Fine, but she gets away from me.
- Keep at it.

403
00:49:36,967 --> 00:49:40,262
In the Pampas,
the knife is in the belt.

404
00:49:40,359 --> 00:49:42,563
In the slums they hide it...

405
00:49:42,631 --> 00:49:45,348
in their sleeves,
ready for use...

406
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:48,033
sharp side up.

407
00:49:48,103 --> 00:49:50,274
It's an extension of the arm.

408
00:49:52,103 --> 00:49:55,813
Okay, the blade is on the left side
of the jacket.

409
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,083
Both are right-handed. Go!

410
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:01,345
Not so direct.

411
00:50:02,663 --> 00:50:05,696
Be more catlike. Stalk.

412
00:50:05,766 --> 00:50:07,261
Very good.

413
00:50:09,863 --> 00:50:11,357
Slowly.

414
00:50:17,735 --> 00:50:19,394
That's good.

415
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,476
One of you should break out...

416
00:50:29,544 --> 00:50:31,910
and attack hard, right?

417
00:50:33,032 --> 00:50:35,934
A deep thrust, a scream. Now!

418
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:41,854
Hold that position.

419
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,453
Turn.

420
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,211
That's the way.

421
00:50:50,535 --> 00:50:52,029
Junior, wait.

422
00:50:52,136 --> 00:50:55,169
Sorry. Carlos, hold this
for me a second.

423
00:50:57,704 --> 00:50:59,198
Give me the knife.

424
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:04,803
It should be loose in the hand...

425
00:51:04,872 --> 00:51:07,238
the wrist flexible.

426
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:12,061
It only stiffens to strike.

427
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,193
Your latest acquisition?

428
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:24,705
What do you think?

429
00:53:24,776 --> 00:53:26,664
She has a lot to learn.

430
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,854
She's young.

431
00:53:31,304 --> 00:53:33,159
She can learn.

432
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,127
You should know.

433
00:53:37,192 --> 00:53:40,575
But watch out,
her 'godfather' is dangerous.

434
00:53:43,528 --> 00:53:45,383
Let's do the trio.

435
00:53:46,409 --> 00:53:48,579
We need another look at it.

436
00:53:50,152 --> 00:53:52,008
You won't need that.

437
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,211
Music!

438
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:39,555
Did you like it?

439
00:57:42,147 --> 00:57:43,741
- We'll rework it.
- Okay.

440
00:57:43,812 --> 00:57:45,667
Thanks. See you later.

441
00:57:45,733 --> 00:57:47,620
Listen, everyone.

442
00:57:47,716 --> 00:57:49,855
We'll do the introduction.

443
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:51,648
Who did the introduction?

444
00:57:51,717 --> 00:57:53,572
Take your places.

445
00:57:56,485 --> 00:57:58,340
I want to talk to you.

446
00:57:58,406 --> 00:58:00,959
- Must it be now?
- If you can.

447
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:02,437
I can't.

448
00:58:02,502 --> 00:58:05,502
- They're waiting for me.
- Then when?

449
00:58:09,702 --> 00:58:11,109
Ask me to dinner.

450
00:58:13,159 --> 00:58:14,468
All right.

451
00:58:21,287 --> 00:58:23,142
You living with somebody?

452
00:58:26,727 --> 00:58:29,149
Come off it.
You know who I live with.

453
00:58:30,536 --> 00:58:32,391
Angelo Larroca.

454
00:58:33,833 --> 00:58:36,069
An excellent godfather.

455
00:58:36,136 --> 00:58:37,991
We're splitting up.

456
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:42,697
Why, if I may ask?

457
00:58:42,793 --> 00:58:45,182
We don't get along.

458
00:58:45,289 --> 00:58:47,078
I'm hard to live with.

459
00:58:48,105 --> 00:58:50,472
Living with someone is awful.

460
00:58:50,538 --> 00:58:54,793
Every time I've tried,
it's been a mess.

461
00:58:55,786 --> 00:58:57,826
I'm a special case.

462
00:58:57,898 --> 00:59:01,062
I'm sort of solitary animal...

463
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:02,886
one of those old lions...

464
00:59:02,954 --> 00:59:06,817
who roam the African savannah
aimlessly.

465
00:59:06,923 --> 00:59:10,698
Lionesses are different.

466
00:59:10,764 --> 00:59:14,539
They gather, unite, hunt...

467
00:59:14,604 --> 00:59:16,993
whelp, nurse...

468
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:20,329
protect their defenseless cubs.

469
00:59:20,396 --> 00:59:23,266
They have a concrete mission in life.

470
00:59:25,165 --> 00:59:28,296
Nurse, protect, mate...

471
00:59:29,581 --> 00:59:32,363
That's a woman's mission in life?

472
00:59:32,429 --> 00:59:35,561
What did you think I said?

473
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:37,386
That.

474
00:59:37,454 --> 00:59:41,284
I didn't mean that.
I respect women too much.

475
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:45,384
Maybe that was a bad analogy.

476
00:59:47,726 --> 00:59:50,410
Men...

477
00:59:50,479 --> 00:59:53,774
have been raised
to hunt and fight...

478
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:55,781
for thousands of years.

479
00:59:56,783 --> 00:59:58,474
Now...

480
00:59:58,543 --> 01:00:00,910
he hunts in his own way.

481
01:00:01,007 --> 01:00:03,822
Let's say he goes haywire...

482
01:00:03,887 --> 01:00:06,735
for a little power...

483
01:00:06,832 --> 01:00:11,404
or a medal or money,
a form of power.

484
01:00:12,688 --> 01:00:15,055
It'd be a shame if women...

485
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:17,641
followed men in their folly.

486
01:00:17,745 --> 01:00:20,047
That's what I meant.

487
01:00:20,113 --> 01:00:22,382
All I ask of men...

488
01:00:22,449 --> 01:00:25,745
is to respect me, listen to me...

489
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:29,585
and not treat me like a nut
spouting nonsense.

490
01:00:30,962 --> 01:00:35,502
Why is it so hard for men
to admit that a beautiful woman...

491
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:37,872
can also be intelligent?

492
01:00:38,771 --> 01:00:42,087
Must a good mind always go
with an ugly face?

493
01:00:42,195 --> 01:00:45,326
That's not what I think.

494
01:00:50,292 --> 01:00:52,463
How can I put this?

495
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:57,522
You wake up one day,
look in a mirror...

496
01:00:57,589 --> 01:00:59,476
and say, "I've aged."

497
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:03,403
You go outside
and the young call you mister.

498
01:01:03,509 --> 01:01:05,451
They look at you askance.

499
01:01:05,557 --> 01:01:10,292
To them, you've gone over the hill.
You're an old fart.

500
01:01:10,389 --> 01:01:12,778
Time goes by...

501
01:01:12,886 --> 01:01:15,853
your hair starts to fall out...

502
01:01:15,958 --> 01:01:18,478
then the rest falls apart.

503
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:20,972
You like good food, you get fat...

504
01:01:21,078 --> 01:01:23,500
you get lazy, stop going out.

505
01:01:24,886 --> 01:01:26,544
Still...

506
01:01:26,614 --> 01:01:28,916
despite the physical decay...

507
01:01:28,982 --> 01:01:32,561
you feel as energetic as a boy.

508
01:01:32,631 --> 01:01:34,486
So what do you do?

509
01:01:35,511 --> 01:01:39,952
Why is it unseemly for a man
to act like a boy?

510
01:01:40,024 --> 01:01:44,432
I can't enjoy a girl of 18
because I'm an older man.

511
01:01:47,896 --> 01:01:50,482
How old are you, anyway?

512
01:01:50,553 --> 01:01:52,015
Twenty-three.

513
01:01:53,657 --> 01:01:55,544
You seem younger.

514
01:01:55,641 --> 01:01:58,008
Let's see if I can complete this.

515
01:02:00,762 --> 01:02:02,867
On that day you wonder...

516
01:02:02,937 --> 01:02:04,912
"What life have I had?"

517
01:02:05,018 --> 01:02:06,806
"What's happened to me?"

518
01:02:06,874 --> 01:02:09,842
"Where are my youthful illusions,
my dreams?"

519
01:02:09,914 --> 01:02:12,565
You can't say that. It's unfair.

520
01:02:12,635 --> 01:02:14,490
You've done wonderful things.

521
01:02:16,603 --> 01:02:18,294
Thank you.

522
01:02:18,363 --> 01:02:23,033
Maybe. But I can't help feeling
I've wasted my time.

523
01:02:24,379 --> 01:02:28,209
That I only touched
the surface of things.

524
01:02:28,316 --> 01:02:31,098
All I did was to swim frantically...

525
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:33,368
to avoid sinking into the muck.

526
01:02:35,196 --> 01:02:37,717
How does that sound to you?

527
01:02:37,789 --> 01:02:39,644
Pretentious, eh?

528
01:02:39,709 --> 01:02:41,564
But vivid, right?

529
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:48,821
Anyway...

530
01:02:48,925 --> 01:02:52,057
all that to say I'm a good guy...

531
01:02:52,126 --> 01:02:54,493
modest, simple...

532
01:02:54,558 --> 01:02:57,624
sensitive, hardworking, honest...

533
01:02:57,694 --> 01:03:00,215
unable to organize my life...

534
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:05,468
And deeply frustrated in love.

535
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:20,383
It's very nice.

536
01:03:26,433 --> 01:03:28,288
I have to leave, Mario.

537
01:03:30,945 --> 01:03:33,215
Stay with me tonight.

538
01:03:34,369 --> 01:03:35,995
I can't.

539
01:03:37,474 --> 01:03:39,579
Someone's waiting? Sorry.

540
01:04:38,887 --> 01:04:42,018
It's all wrong.

541
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:45,633
You got carried away
by your imagination.

542
01:04:45,703 --> 01:04:48,158
That's not enough,
and you know it.

543
01:04:49,416 --> 01:04:52,133
You need more discipline.

544
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,910
What's the dramatic line
that fies all this?

545
01:04:58,056 --> 01:05:00,129
The woman leaves him.

546
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:03,616
The guy falls apart,
but another woman appears.

547
01:05:03,688 --> 01:05:06,023
A younger dancer.

548
01:05:06,089 --> 01:05:08,031
They falls in love.

549
01:05:08,137 --> 01:05:11,486
- He falls in love?
- Does he fall in love?

550
01:05:11,594 --> 01:05:13,895
Or is he grasping at straws?

551
01:05:13,962 --> 01:05:16,067
And her?

552
01:05:16,138 --> 01:05:19,172
Does she fall in love?

553
01:05:19,243 --> 01:05:20,933
She exploits it.

554
01:05:21,002 --> 01:05:24,101
He pursues her, despairs
if she's not there.

555
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:28,132
She's everything to him.
She hides, slips away.

556
01:05:28,203 --> 01:05:30,112
She plays.

557
01:05:30,219 --> 01:05:32,553
He has no time for games.

558
01:05:34,188 --> 01:05:36,326
What's the woman do?

559
01:05:36,395 --> 01:05:38,599
She returns?

560
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:41,963
I love you. I adore you.
I need you.

561
01:05:44,876 --> 01:05:47,397
What a lot of nonsense.

562
01:05:51,692 --> 01:05:53,831
Never changes.

563
01:05:56,045 --> 01:05:59,111
But there's no other way
to tell the story.

564
01:06:02,094 --> 01:06:04,942
Inspiration, where are you?

565
01:06:07,982 --> 01:06:12,173
What is inspiration
but work, work, work?

566
01:06:14,511 --> 01:06:16,584
Who said that?

567
01:06:17,967 --> 01:06:19,822
A labor leader.

568
01:13:02,097 --> 01:13:04,072
What are you doing?

569
01:13:05,553 --> 01:13:08,750
- How did you get in?
- The janitor let me in.

570
01:13:08,818 --> 01:13:11,185
What are you doing
with the wind machine?

571
01:13:11,282 --> 01:13:13,616
Lmagining a scene.

572
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:16,911
- Was I in it?
- Of course.

573
01:13:17,906 --> 01:13:19,532
Beautiful as ever.

574
01:13:19,602 --> 01:13:23,432
- And unexpected.
- I came to keep you company.

575
01:13:24,819 --> 01:13:26,226
At 3: 00 a.m.?

576
01:13:26,291 --> 01:13:28,942
I have an idea for your show.

577
01:13:34,484 --> 01:13:35,978
Sit down.

578
01:13:47,317 --> 01:13:48,811
Ready?

579
01:13:50,741 --> 01:13:56,208
¢Ü Life is so strange, friend

580
01:13:56,277 --> 01:14:01,034
¢Ü I didn't love her when I met her

581
01:14:02,198 --> 01:14:06,737
¢Ü Until one night
she firmly said to me

582
01:14:06,806 --> 01:14:11,891
¢Ü "I'm tired of everything"
and left

583
01:14:11,959 --> 01:14:16,214
¢Ü Life is so strange, friend

584
01:14:16,311 --> 01:14:19,213
¢Ü Ever since that night

585
01:14:19,319 --> 01:14:22,319
¢Ü I fell in love with her

586
01:14:23,479 --> 01:14:26,414
¢Ü I sacrificed so much

587
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:58,288
Lights!

588
01:15:01,755 --> 01:15:03,249
Music!

589
01:18:01,482 --> 01:18:05,060
The kid was 13 or 14.

590
01:18:06,091 --> 01:18:09,157
Those brutes jumped on him...

591
01:18:09,227 --> 01:18:11,366
and bashed his head in...

592
01:18:11,435 --> 01:18:14,751
with their rifle butts and boots.

593
01:18:14,859 --> 01:18:17,761
- They killed him?
- Sure. He was dead!

594
01:18:17,868 --> 01:18:20,421
- Maria Elman.
- Delighted.

595
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:28,453
I hear you've worked out
a choreography on our theme.

596
01:18:28,524 --> 01:18:32,322
We're looking for ideas
in Goya's etchings.

597
01:18:32,396 --> 01:18:34,251
That's perfect.

598
01:18:34,317 --> 01:18:36,706
Hist repeats itself, alas.

599
01:18:38,829 --> 01:18:41,863
That's part of our lives.

600
01:18:41,933 --> 01:18:44,715
The horrible, cruel part...

601
01:18:44,781 --> 01:18:47,651
that we wish we could avoid.

602
01:18:48,686 --> 01:18:50,541
But it's there.

603
01:18:53,102 --> 01:18:55,655
Sorry. Waldo Norman,
our art director.

604
01:19:03,119 --> 01:19:07,342
The tortures played tangos loud
to cover up the screams.

605
01:20:04,596 --> 01:20:07,760
Imagination is a guardrail...

606
01:20:07,828 --> 01:20:11,025
that stops you from plunging
into the pit of horror.

607
01:20:12,661 --> 01:20:16,590
I'm haunted by images of friends...

608
01:20:17,974 --> 01:20:19,381
who disappeared.

609
01:20:19,446 --> 01:20:21,682
Thousands lost their lives...

610
01:20:25,334 --> 01:20:30,288
in that brutal and
uncontrolled repression.

611
01:20:31,190 --> 01:20:33,940
I left here when I was young.

612
01:20:34,006 --> 01:20:37,006
Relatively young.

613
01:20:37,079 --> 01:20:40,625
I spent many years in Europe.
When I got back...

614
01:20:40,695 --> 01:20:43,445
most of my friends had disappeared.

615
01:20:46,647 --> 01:20:48,436
What remained...

616
01:20:48,503 --> 01:20:51,602
was this city, completely changed.

617
01:20:53,592 --> 01:20:56,659
Ugly, grey and distrustful.

618
01:20:56,729 --> 01:20:58,965
Why think about all that?

619
01:21:00,313 --> 01:21:02,647
Ugly things are best forgotten.

620
01:21:08,313 --> 01:21:10,168
Who we are...

621
01:21:12,986 --> 01:21:16,183
how we live,
how little we are...

622
01:21:18,426 --> 01:21:20,597
If we forget all that...

623
01:21:20,666 --> 01:21:23,034
what identity will we have?

624
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:25,138
But now you're here.

625
01:21:25,242 --> 01:21:27,414
We have each other.

626
01:21:28,667 --> 01:21:30,610
We're lucky.

627
01:21:40,348 --> 01:21:41,809
What's that?

628
01:21:41,916 --> 01:21:44,055
Sound effects. They're testing.

629
01:21:49,085 --> 01:21:51,387
You know, I'm worried.

630
01:21:53,309 --> 01:21:56,157
I think I'm being followed.

631
01:21:56,254 --> 01:21:58,458
Today when I came over...

632
01:21:58,526 --> 01:22:02,323
a car followed my taxi.

633
01:22:02,429 --> 01:22:04,797
- Larroca?
- Who else?

634
01:22:06,367 --> 01:22:08,734
You're not imagining things?

635
01:22:10,110 --> 01:22:11,604
Maybe.

636
01:22:13,087 --> 01:22:15,543
But Angelo scares me.
He's violent.

637
01:22:15,647 --> 01:22:17,502
He's Mafia.

638
01:22:19,135 --> 01:22:22,300
The other day he said,
"If you leave me, I'll kill you."

639
01:22:24,448 --> 01:22:26,870
Come and live...

640
01:22:26,976 --> 01:22:28,537
with me.

641
01:22:29,632 --> 01:22:31,520
You mean it?

642
01:22:38,817 --> 01:22:41,916
If you feel that I love you,
come here.

643
01:22:41,986 --> 01:22:43,840
Come live with me.

644
01:22:47,457 --> 01:22:49,312
You've got problems.

645
01:22:50,626 --> 01:22:52,536
I don't want to be one more.

646
01:22:55,746 --> 01:22:57,983
You'll move in tomorrow?

647
01:29:18,882 --> 01:29:20,857
Good work, kids.

648
01:29:20,963 --> 01:29:22,556
I don't like it.

649
01:29:22,627 --> 01:29:26,337
Why bring up something
that has been forgotten?

650
01:29:26,403 --> 01:29:28,672
Why create more anxiety?

651
01:29:28,739 --> 01:29:32,798
That number threatens
the whole show.

652
01:29:32,867 --> 01:29:35,551
- It scared me!
- I can see why!

653
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:39,679
It could be softened.

654
01:29:39,748 --> 01:29:42,366
What do you say, Larroca?

655
01:29:42,436 --> 01:29:44,346
I want to think it over first.

656
01:29:49,605 --> 01:29:51,994
- Hello.
- What did you think?

657
01:29:53,733 --> 01:29:56,700
We liked the show a lot.

658
01:29:56,773 --> 01:29:58,596
Very impressive.

659
01:29:58,662 --> 01:30:03,135
I don't think you need that scene.
The audience won't get it.

660
01:30:04,646 --> 01:30:07,329
We gave them beautiful dancing...

661
01:30:07,399 --> 01:30:09,286
beautiful women...

662
01:30:09,350 --> 01:30:12,198
Iovely tango music.

663
01:30:12,263 --> 01:30:16,224
Then here, it all turns
to fear, anxiety.

664
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:20,037
That doesn't belong in a musical.

665
01:30:20,104 --> 01:30:22,952
It's my conception of the show.

666
01:30:23,016 --> 01:30:25,187
Maybe you could soften it a bit.

667
01:30:25,256 --> 01:30:28,191
The generals won't like it.

668
01:30:28,296 --> 01:30:30,151
Depends which ones.

669
01:30:31,144 --> 01:30:33,698
There's a fascinating Borges quote:

670
01:30:33,769 --> 01:30:36,518
"The past is indestructible."

671
01:30:36,585 --> 01:30:39,203
"Sooner or later
things turn up again."

672
01:30:39,273 --> 01:30:41,891
"One of the things that turns up..."

673
01:30:41,961 --> 01:30:44,547
"is a plan to destroy the past."

674
01:30:46,474 --> 01:30:48,329
Very clever.

675
01:30:48,394 --> 01:30:50,631
But one washes dirty linen at home.

676
01:30:50,698 --> 01:30:53,000
Depends on the linen and the home.

677
01:30:54,314 --> 01:30:56,736
Think it over. We disliked it.

678
01:30:56,842 --> 01:30:58,981
I wo681n't press it further.

679
01:30:59,979 --> 01:31:01,473
Good night.

680
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:54,662
Why'd you want to see me?

681
01:31:57,808 --> 01:31:59,695
Why?

682
01:31:59,792 --> 01:32:02,727
- To talk to you.
- What about?

683
01:32:06,513 --> 01:32:08,652
We could talk about lots of things.

684
01:32:09,681 --> 01:32:11,536
I'd rather discuss us.

685
01:32:11,601 --> 01:32:13,838
Haven't we said it all?

686
01:32:13,905 --> 01:32:16,326
Not everything.

687
01:32:17,586 --> 01:32:20,106
I can't live this way, Elena.

688
01:32:20,177 --> 01:32:22,567
I can't forget you, try as I may.

689
01:32:23,794 --> 01:32:25,288
Please.

690
01:32:27,378 --> 01:32:29,768
Come back to me.

691
01:32:29,874 --> 01:32:33,223
Angelo, let's not start that again.

692
01:32:33,331 --> 01:32:35,633
I love you, Elena.

693
01:32:35,699 --> 01:32:37,554
I love you...

694
01:32:37,619 --> 01:32:39,474
and I want you.

695
01:32:39,539 --> 01:32:43,314
I need to kiss you,
make love to you.

696
01:32:43,379 --> 01:32:45,289
Please...

697
01:32:45,396 --> 01:32:47,567
Hug me.

698
01:32:47,636 --> 01:32:49,262
Hug me, Elena.

699
01:32:49,332 --> 01:32:51,754
I love you!

700
01:32:51,860 --> 01:32:53,715
Let go of me!

701
01:32:55,892 --> 01:32:58,478
I don't love you.
I never did!

702
01:32:58,549 --> 01:33:02,030
I'm living with another man
and I'm happy!

703
01:33:02,101 --> 01:33:04,011
I don't care, Elena.

704
01:33:04,118 --> 01:33:05,940
I don't care.

705
01:33:06,005 --> 01:33:07,947
I can forgive everything!

706
01:33:08,054 --> 01:33:10,029
Right now!

707
01:33:10,134 --> 01:33:11,378
Let me go!

708
01:33:12,438 --> 01:33:15,253
Let me live in peace.

709
01:33:15,318 --> 01:33:17,587
You're making a mistake, Elena!

710
01:33:18,902 --> 01:33:20,790
You're making a mistake!

711
01:33:22,231 --> 01:33:24,303
No one plays games with me!

712
01:43:37,962 --> 01:43:39,457
Please.

713
01:43:42,634 --> 01:43:44,390
My love.

714
01:43:53,355 --> 01:43:55,243
How was it?

715
01:43:56,492 --> 01:43:59,656
- What's wrong?
- I got scared.

716
01:43:59,724 --> 01:44:01,764
That's fine.
Thanks, everyone.

717
01:44:01,836 --> 01:44:04,519
That's all for today.

718
01:44:04,588 --> 01:44:06,923
I want you all in the studio...

719
01:44:06,988 --> 01:44:10,731
tomorrow at 8: 00 a.m.
For the immigration ballet.

720
01:44:10,797 --> 01:44:13,612
In costume and made up by 11: 00.

721
01:44:13,677 --> 01:44:15,139
Okay?

722
01:44:15,245 --> 01:44:17,798
- You liked my work?
- Terrific!

723
01:44:17,869 --> 01:44:20,171
- Marvelous.
- Was I convincing?

724
01:44:21,389 --> 01:44:23,015
Let's go.

725
01:44:23,086 --> 01:44:26,435
Let's see what the director says.

726
01:44:32,591 --> 01:44:34,151
Let's go.

727
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,171
Congratulations, Maestro.

728
01:44:52,052 --> 01:44:54,043
- You were great.
- Thanks.

01:44:59,493 --> 01:45:01,654
Sorry, but one thing bothers me.

730
01:45:01,728 --> 01:45:03,696
My shout comes too soon.

731
01:45:03,764 --> 01:45:07,063
It's not spontaneous enough.

732
01:45:07,134 --> 01:45:08,965
That's the trouble.

733
01:45:09,036 --> 01:45:12,301
I was terrified.
I thought he stabbed her.

734
01:45:12,372 --> 01:45:17,105
Set up a rehearsal for me tomorrow
so I can work on my timing.
