You...What are you

Madhu, What is happening here
against my wishes?

68
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:11,312
Knowing fully well that
I Iove you

00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:13,951
My peopIe fixed this marriage

70
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,212
But you wllI have to refuse
this marriage

71
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,117
But Madhu they are not going to
llsten to me at all

72
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:22,989
Even after knowing, that I am
carrying your baby

73
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:26,893
I agree that I have put you
in a great fix

74
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,134
But there was no other way
except this

75
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,461
There is onIy one way

76
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,265
I consume poison & die so that
you can get married peacefully

77
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,965
No, madhu, no, I have thought
of a way out

78
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:37,732
What?

79
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,707
I have heard that your sister
& uncIe have come from DeIhi

80
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,881
Yes -You to go DeIhi
with them

81
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,649
I have a good friend
there -

82
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,648
He wllI take you to
a good doctor

83
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,744
you don't have to
worry at all

84
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,820
Go in the morning and return
in the evening

85
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,752
He wllI do the
abortion

86
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:57,256
And here is some money
for your expenses

87
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,169
I know you are a
coward -

88
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:08,170
But you are so mean, I have come
to know onIy today

89
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:26,354
Keep quiet, keep quiet,
Don't cry

90
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:33,621
Don't do anything
rash-

91
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,630
So that situation doesn't
worsen further

92
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:38,131
Brother,What's Ieft
there to worsen

93
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,434
After destroying the llfe of
our Madhu

94
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,738
That rascaI is going to
get married

95
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,966
I wllI stop this
marriage

96
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,279
Listen, I wllI go and meet
Ratan's father,Thakur Raghuvir Singh

97
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:57,387
I am very sure that when he comes
to know the facts-

98
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,684
He wllI force Ratan
to fuIfll his promise

99
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,057
Answer Ratan

100
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:05,022
The accusation that Thakur
Jaswant Singh has put on you

101
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,900
Is it true? Or
is it a lle?

102
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:09,894
Father, all are lles

103
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,304
Look, Ratan

104
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:22,573
I have come here neither to
quarreI nor to scoId you

105
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:27,245
Human beings make mistakes,
You have aIso committed etc

106
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:31,219
But now it is your duty that you
accept your mistake

107
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,585
And keep the promise you
made to Madhumathi...

108
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,283
What's the mistake &
What's the promise?

109
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:40,763
By concocting these stories
you want to defame me

110
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:42,696
Concocting stories!?

111
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,797
Then, is it not true that Madhumathi
is pregnant?

112
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:47,263
She might be

113
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,033
She might be but I am not
responsibIe for it

114
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,505
You are a llar, you are
a crook.

115
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,105
And you are mean & wretched
person of the highest order

116
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:54,779
Dhanraj

117
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,073
Thakur Jaswant Singh

118
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,983
Ask Dhanraj to shut up otherwise
there wllI be bIoodshed here

119
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,484
There wllI be bIoodshed
Randhir Singh

120
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:05,156
My sister's honour is ruined
& I remain a sllent spectator -

121
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,417
I wllI exterminate whoIe
of your cIan

122
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,619
Dhanraj keep quiet
Let me taIk

123
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,525
Then you taIk

124
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,126
There is no use striking your
head against a stone

125
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:27,137
Mr.Randhir Singh

126
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:31,611
Knowing well, its a question of the
prestige of our famlly -

127
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,481
I Ieave the decision
to you

128
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,826
Thakur Jaswant Singh, I fully
sympathise with you-

129
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:45,291
More than that I cannot
say anything

130
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:53,496
Remember Thakur

131
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:58,274
The end resuIt of this wllI
not be good

132
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,196
Shall I say something?

133
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,094
Go ahead

134
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,103
Whatever Thakur Jaswant Singh
had said

135
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:30,571
It's all true

136
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:31,435
What is true?

137
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,604
This evening Madhumathi had come to
meet Ratan here-

138
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:39,376
Hiding behind the window I
heard their entire conversation-

139
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:43,880
They used to meet steaIthy,
and she-

140
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,718
Is going to be the mother of
Ratan's chlld

141
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:51,388
PIease llsten to me. For god's
sake stop this marriage

142
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:55,098
And make Ratan to agree to
marry Madhumathi

143
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,895
Keep quiet,absoIuteIy
keep quiet-

144
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:01,505
Before marriage the girI who has
Iost her honour

145
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,409
She is not worthy of becoming the
daughter-in-Iaw of this famlly

146
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,576
And llsten very
carefully-

147
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:10,008
You have mentioned
this today-

148
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:14,614
But here after if anybody taIks
even a word about it-

149
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,151
I wllI be very harsh
on him

150
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:25,931
Randhir, Son you make your
father see to reason

151
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,676
Dhanraj, Nothing wllI go
out of confrontation

152
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:41,910
There wllI be a
big scandaI

153
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,773
We'll Ioose our prestige in the
entire vllIage-

154
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,613
Then by keeping quiet wllI this
thing lle dormant-

155
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,781
From tomorrow itseIf this news
wllI spread llke wlld fire

156
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,987
That we wllI be constrained even
to step out of this house

157
00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:01,027
That's why I have decided to
Ieave this vllIage

158
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:07,936
We wllI sell our house, Sell
the entire property -

159
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:08,868
And go to DeIhi

160
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,139
And what shall we
do there?

161
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,845
Whatever we do,
We may even starve

162
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,075
But we won't be ridicuIed
by peopIe

163
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:22,985
A respectabIe person can bear all
the hardships of the worId-

164
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,655
But cannot llve
shameIessIy

165
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:47,641
Dhanraj whatever I am
going to do-

166
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:49,876
I am very sad about it

167
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,241
I am sure

168
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:56,119
That kishan wllI give us a good
price for our house & fieIds

169
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,855
Okay, I'll return
by the evening

170
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:09,530
Brother

171
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:13,367
Parvati, What happened?

172
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,055
Ratan Singh

173
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:59,077
Ratan singh this is the corpse of my
sister Madhumathi

174
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,644
According to your promises -

175
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,253
She shouId have become your
bride today-

176
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,654
But today her dead body wllI
be carried-

177
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:15,157
Dead body wllI be carried
Ratan Singh,but not one

178
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:17,561
Stop -

179
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,395
But two

180
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,264
Wait Dhanraj

181
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:53,460
Court awarded llfe imprisonment
to Thakur Dhanraj Singh for murder

182
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,864
Surrounded by the high walls
of the jall

183
00:13:56,068 --> 00:14:01,062
A narrow cell became the abode
of Dhanraj Singh

184
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:05,810
Jaswant Singh soId his house &
the entire property-

185
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:10,072
Left the vllIage Dhanakpur for good
& went away to DeIhi

186
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,147
And in the house
of Bhagwandas-

187
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:17,413
He started a new llfe with
his entire famlly-

188
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:22,386
In partnership with Bhagwandas
he started cIoth business-

189
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,153
And became a very successfuI trader
in no time

190
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,559
He had onIy one aim
in his llfe-

191
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,533
To give good education to
the son of Dhanraj

192
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:33,898
And llke this the
time passed

193
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,631
Days became months & months
became years

194
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,002
And then that day came

195
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,623
For your good conducts, Govt. has
decided to reIease you 6 months earIy

196
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:59,264
My dear father, You wllI be
pIeased to know

197
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:01,194
That now our exams
are over

198
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:05,568
On 10th Aprll, in our college
there is a farewell party

199
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,807
In this party, aIong with my
friends I am -

200
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,600
Presenting a musicaI
programme

201
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:14,272
UncIe amd others in the famlly
are not interested in music

202
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:15,837
Had you been here

203
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,606
I wouId have definiteIy
invited

204
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:21,108
But its my bad Iuck that you
are so far away

205
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,452
But that day is not far
when you'll be amongst us-

206
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,449
And I am impatientIy waiting
for that day

207
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:29,623
Your son, Raj

208
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:37,454
Friends, first I want to thank
the 2nd year students

209
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:40,088
Who, for the finaI
year students,

210
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,358
Have given this grand
party today

211
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,339
For us this is our Iast day
in the college

212
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,810
And I know

213
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:55,280
That for the forthcoming llfe
everyone has thought of something

214
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:59,012
But I haven't thought of
anything for me

215
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:01,720
And today

216
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,215
Today I am thinking of onIy one
thing repeatedIy

217
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:06,649
What?

218
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,489

very enjoyabIe

219
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,329
What's the programme

220
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,333
We are stuck up badIy

00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:47,835
UncIe has put us
in the office

222
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,972
Very unfortunate

223
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:50,106
Why don't you come for hunting
with us

224
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,173
What Shyam?
Shall we go?

225
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:52,001

Bhagwandas!
I have a request-

243
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:12,919
Jall and whatever this famlly
has gone through-

244
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,650
ShouId never be mentioned
in this house-

245
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,696
Brother tell me

246
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,765
How is our business

247
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:26,998
By the grace of god,

251
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,147
It's definiteIy the mischief
of that rascaI Randhir Singh

I'll go to Dhanakpur

253
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:23,685
Brother, neither you nor brother
Jaswant need go to Dhanakpur

254
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:25,895
Raj & Shyam can go and
do this job

255
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:28,132
And aIso nobody recognizes
them there

256
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,425

257
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,730

Dhanakpur VllIage

260
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:37,398

There meet Iawyer BiharllaI and

262
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,306
Okay

00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:48,512
Don't roam there
unnecessarlly

266

I have flled your appllcation in

269
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:01,464
But tell Thakur
Jaswant Singh-

270
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,834
That the case won't
be decided soon

271
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:05,536
Won't be decided soon?
- No

272
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:07,799
Appllcation is against
Randhir Singh

273
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,371
He wllI aIso act soon

274
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:12,198
What wllI he do soon?

275
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,405
It's difficuIt to tell
you immediateIy

276
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:18,746
Listen. LegaI matters are not
resoIved immediateIy

277
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,713
As the proceeding proceeds,-

278
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:24,218
I wllI inform Mr.Jaswant Singh
immediateIy about them

279
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,453
ImmediateIy - definiteIy

280
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,056
Listen, Randhir Singh is a very
dangerous person

281
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:34,589
The news of your arrivaI can
reach him immediateIy - yes

282
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,562
That's why it
wllI be better-

283
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:38,598
That both of you go away
immediateIy

284
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,801
Okay, We'll go away
immediateIy

285
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:45,074
I want to go to a pIace...
immediateIy

286
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:53,382
What a strange man? Come Iet's
go from here

287
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:54,882
Shall we go?

288
00:25:57,188 --> 00:26:00,351
In my youth I was sitting
on a horse-

289
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,424
And the horse is running

290
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:08,660
Horse fell down. I am down and
the horse is above me

291
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:09,925
What happened? Why did you
stop the bike

292
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:13,434
This is probabIy the mansion of
Thakur Raghuvir Singh isn't it ?

293
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,565
May be

294
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:19,171
Come Iet's ask that person
come

295
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:21,775
And then...

296
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,845
UncIe greetings

297
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:24,674

298
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:26,350
Whose mansion is this?

299
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:32,349
This is Thakur Raghuvir Singh's
mansion in the name of god

300
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:34,286
But he is no more allve

301
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,622
His son's are there.
Thakur Randhir Singh

302
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,989
Brother, the entire famlly has
shifted to DeIhi

303
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:44,259

the accounts of farming-

304
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,132
In the name of god

305

She is Rashmi, daughter of
Thakur Randhir Singh

306
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,652
The great activity that you are
seeing in the mansion today-

00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,884
Is because its her
birthday today

From Haripur, Ietter has come that

Even I had seen him

00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:58,869
Now, he must be
a young man

320

00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:31,568
Why?

349
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:36,098
We Thakurs, have a arrow
sharp vision-

350
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,933
That can recognize the friends
and aIso the foes

351
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:42,511
Isn't it? - What?

352
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:46,517
Confused isn't it?
- Yes

353
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:50,510
I had seen you when you
were this big

354
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:53,452
But, I recognized you
as soon as I saw you -

355
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:58,454
That you are definiteIy Roop Singh
son of Kunwar Pratap Singh

356
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:00,194
Ask me...how?

357
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:01,123
How?

358
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:04,131
After seeing the 'R' symboI
on your coat

359
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,532
'R' means Roop Singh!

360
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:10,401
Come with me

361
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:12,072
No, you proceed...I...

362
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:13,275
Come with me...Come on...

363
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,615
Brother! Here is your
Roop Singh

364
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:20,276
He was standing in
that corner

365
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:23,613
Recognized me?

366
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:25,686
Yes, greetings!

367
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,816
OnIy greetings wllI not do
you have to hug me

368
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:36,363
Mr.Man Singh, Come here

369
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:38,893

Kunwar Pratap Singh

00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:39,759

371
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,641

00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,576
Yes, he is Roop Singh

373
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:51,780
I don't know whether
to belleve my eyes or not?

374
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,248
But I feeI something strange
about your appearance

375
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:55,584
Appearance

376
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:56,718
Yes

377
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:02,183
Last year, When I met you in Haripur
You had a great moustache

378
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:03,783
Moustache?!

379
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:05,257
Yes, Where has it gone?

380
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,920
That, I have shaved it

381
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:07,796
Why?

382
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:08,724
Just llke that!

383
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,198
No, No,... Why?

384
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:11,869
Just llke that ..

385
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:13,795
Why?...Why?

386
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:15,064
Mr.Mansingh!

387
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:18,468
It's empty!

388
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:24,339
Your father couIdn't come
I regret very much

389
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:24,879
Yes!

390
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:25,674
What happened to him?

391
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:28,209
He...actually...that...

392
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,217
Again the same Asthma attack?

393
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,548
Yes sir, Asthma!

394
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:34,223
Yes, my son, Asthma is a very
dangerous disease

395
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,362
Then, Shall I Ieave?

396
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:40,554

397
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:43,559
How wllI I allow you to go
without attending the feast -

398
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:45,367
And today, its my
daughter's birthday

399
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:46,699
Don't you want to
meet her?

400
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:47,905
Don't you want to
greet her?

401
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:50,640
You wait here, I'll come with

402
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:54,240
WonderfuI...WonderfuI, How gracefuI

403
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:58,111
Roop Singh! Tell me one thing
Why did you shave off your moustache?

404
00:31:58,483 --> 00:31:58,710
Just llke that?

405
00:31:59,017 --> 00:31:59,847
Just llke that!?!...Why?

406
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:00,712
Just llke that

407
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,777
But, Why?...Why?

408
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,319
Oh! I have shaved my moustache
How does it concern you?

409
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:05,920
Leave my hand

410
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:09,860
Okay, granted it was your moustache
but why did you shave it off?

411
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:11,519
Hey, GentIeman, How many times

00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:12,321

413
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:15,128
Are you really Roop Singh?

414
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:15,789
Yes sir

415
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:18,267
Son of Kunwar Pratap Singh?

416
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:19,470
Yes...Yes

417
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:28,075
Come I'll introduce you to
one more Roop Singh

418
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:40,281
Chlld, You wait here, I'll
come just now

419
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,553
DharampaI! What's
happening here?

420
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:46,896
He fell, I fell on him -

421
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,762
Then all the Thakurs
fell on me

422
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:49,761
But, Who is he?

423
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:51,330
How many times, do I have
to tell you that I am Roop Singh

424
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:52,025
What are you bIabbering?

425
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,630
Catch them...Catch them..
atch them...

426
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:14,053
Rashmi, and then,
What happened

427
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:18,622
Then, everyone fell
calling each other

428
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:20,260
There was a great
uproar

429
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:23,393
And that boy, who came
impersonating Roop Singh

430
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,391
I never saw him

431
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,169
In the meIee, he
ran away

432
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:31,332
Randhir Singh, my son!

433
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,806
Yes mother!

434
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:35,673
Did you find out anything about
that imposter?

435
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:37,744
Now onIy Mr.CIerk, informed
me that -

436
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:40,881
To flle an appllcation against
us in the court -

437
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:43,384
Dhanraj's son had come

438
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,680
And that too, on a red
motor cycIe

439
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:53,421
If onIy, I knew it before
he ran away

440
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:57,623
In front of all my cIan I wouId
have Iashed him so much that -

441
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:00,494
OnIy his corpse wouId have
gone out from here

442
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,206
WonderfuI!...WonderfuI!

443
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:04,568
Come on, llsten...
Listen...Listen

444
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:07,876
Received a Ietter from Pandit
Shivnarain of Mt.Abu-

445
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,845
He has invited all of us to
his son's bethrothaI

446
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:14,681
I think, We didn't have a
hollday for quite a Iong time

447
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,513
So why not take advantage of this
and go to Mt.Abu

448
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,246
Brother, there is a Amba TempIe
near by -

449
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:23,594
I had taken a vow that if he comes back
I wllI offer fIowers

450
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:24,989
Yes, Yes definiteIy
go there

451
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:26,725
AIright, tell me this, Are you coming
to Sitanagar Camp?

452
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,728
It wllI be difficuIt for
me to come

453
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:34,003
Father is sending me to Mt.Abu
with mother and Aunty

454
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:36,803
Mt.Abu and Sitanagar
are very near

455
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:38,665
It's just 3 hours journey
by bus

456
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:42,271
You just tell your father that you want to
go to Sitanagar and not Mt.Abu

457
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,946
But, I can't open my mouth
infront of my father

458
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:46,616
Then, take me with you
to him

459
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:49,014
I wllI open my mouth well
in front of him

460
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,214
UncIe! I was saying that

461
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:54,090
Mt.Abu is Mt.Abu and
Sitanagar is Sitanagar

462
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:55,222
Have you ever visited it?

463
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:57,550
No

464
00:34:58,329 --> 00:34:58,886
UncIe, you shouId visit -

465
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:03,161
If Mt.Abu is earth, then
Sitanagar is the sky!

466
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:05,563
Kavitha, how coId the weather
wllI be?

467
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:08,638
There's so much coId that
You'll aIways be...

468
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,374
Oh god! Then, we wllI
stay in Mt.Abu onIy

469
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,042
Even then, I am very scared
of coId

470
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:14,508
Hey, are we going there
to enjoy or...

471
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,510
Come on Aunty! It is not
llke that ...actually

472
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:19,710
One minute, One minute
I wllI decide now

473
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:20,682
Rashmi!

474
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:25,985
Where do you want to go? Sitanagar? Or Mt.Abu?

475
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:29,921
Come on, say it?

476
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:31,525
Mt.Abu!

477
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:33,057
It's decided

478
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:35,256
KamaIa, I am going to
the office

479
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:40,468
I had toId you, That I'll stagger
infront of my father

480
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:43,935
Don't worry, Come to Mt.Abu

481
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:24,175
Just now, we have reached
all of them have come

Really!

483
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:28,584
Then, What time has the priest
fixed for the engagement?

484
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:32,351
Evening 6'o cIock! Yes sir, wllI reach

485
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:41,931
Smlle pIease! StllI broader

486
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:46,728
I want to take the photograph

00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:49,206
You stay here, I'll come

488
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:52,671
BadIy stuck!

489
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:01,135
Is it broke?

490
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,035
No

491
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:10,009
I have taken your photograph
aIong with sun

492
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,716
You are not offended,

493
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:16,125
No, if the photos wllI be good then,
I wllI not be offended at all

494
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:19,627
I don't know much about
photography?

495
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:21,630
Just trying the Iuck

496
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:22,556
Yes

497
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:26,332
For every new thing, its absoIuteIy
necessary to try the Iuck

498
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:27,969
Yes

499
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,697
By the way, you have done
one thing right

500
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:30,564
What's that?

501
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,308
You are in the right pIace at

00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:50,859
Do one thing, take my photograph

No, not me, I don't know

Tell the reception to send a

00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:26,893
But, She is Randhir Singh's
daughter

640
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:29,768
Think over it

641
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:01,669
Come on friends

642
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,204

TroubIe?

657
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:50,971

658
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:54,970
Hey! Where has this baba
got stuck?

Don't know, how I am
Iooking?

669
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:37,192
But, how did all
this happen?

670
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:41,594
I was going to Sitanagar and
my bus broke down

671
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:45,466
I was taking photographs
of the jungIe

672
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:49,409
I never knew from where this boy
and his friends came

673
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:52,214
They started misbehaving
with me

674
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:56,082
I aIso gave him such a kick
that he'll never forget

675
00:55:57,587 --> 00:55:58,349
Any other hurts?

676
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:03,054
No,nothing that need

677
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,223
There are some sandwiches in this

00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:37,790
What are you doing?

679
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,126
Don't you want to sIeep?

680
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:39,723
SIeep?!

681
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:42,328
No, No, I'll not
sIeep here

682
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:47,535
Look, take me to the road there
I am sure of getting a bus

683
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,269
I have forgotten the way
to the road myseIf

684
00:56:49,506 --> 00:56:49,733
What?

685
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:50,600
Yes

686
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:53,404
I had come on a hunting trip
with friends

687
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:56,943
They went on hunting and I got
separated from them

688
00:56:57,514 --> 00:56:58,412
Are you telling the
truth?

689
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:03,018
Then, What in this dangerous forest am I
spending this night for fun?

690
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:11,619
Are you going to
sIeep?

691
00:57:13,663 --> 00:57:14,721
Won't you have a small
chat?

692
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:17,160
Didn't get tired after wandering
in the forest the whoIe day?

693
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:21,837
I was tired, but after meeting you
I have become fresh

694
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:24,605
If you permit,I can taIk all the
night with you

695
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,173
Can I come to you?

696
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:29,838
No, its Iate night,
go to sIeep

697
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,845
You have arranged my bed
so far away

698
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:41,854
That if I get scared,
I cannot hoId your hand

699
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:45,986
Scared? Being a Rajput

700
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:48,595
How do you know that I am
a Rajput?

701
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:50,658
Your modesty and spIendour
are llke Rajput?

702
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:51,665
Thank you

703
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:54,734
These are the first words uttered
in my honour

704
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:58,601
If you want to say anything in my
honour I am ready to llsten

705
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:01,538
Can I come to you?

706
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:56,989
May be, You want to know
something about me

707
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:58,190
What?

708
00:59:58,628 --> 00:59:59,925
Why don't you ask me
straight away?

709
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:00,995
Ask what?

710
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,991
Okay, don't ask, I wllI tell
myseIf

711
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,460
That, I am from DeIhi,
Where do you come from?

712
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:14,271
I am a Rajput and my
name is Rashmi

713
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:15,469
What is your name?

714
01:00:15,845 --> 01:00:16,277
Raj!

715
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:24,142
I think its better to tell you that I
have passed my first year exams

716
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:28,954
I am 18 years oId and I have
not married yet

717
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:33,619
Look, there is nothing
to hide

718
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:43,038
Now, that fate has put us together
in this way -

719
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:46,275
We don't know for how Iong we
wllI be wandering llke this -

720
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:49,976
It'll be better if we know something
about each other

721
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:54,707
It wllI be better,
isn't it?

722
01:00:56,886 --> 01:00:59,650
Then, I have toId you
everything cIearIy

723
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:04,321
You have impressed
me a Iot

724
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:08,120
I think this reIationship
shouId deveIop -

725
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:12,667
If you ask me my address
I wllI not refuse

726
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:14,195
Look, We'll have this taIk
Iater on

727
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:15,867
First Iet me find the
way to the road

728
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:16,866
Then, Why don't you
move on? -

729
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:21,202
Why are you wasting the time
standing here and taIking nonsense?

730
01:01:21,377 --> 01:01:22,537
Was I taIking nonsense?

731
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:23,871
Then, was I taIking
nonsense?

732
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:29,412
Look, its not a
matter to Iaugh

733
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:32,154
If we don't find the way by
this evening, then -

734
01:01:33,723 --> 01:01:36,089
For the entire llfe, we wllI be
going round this pIace

735
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:38,218
Can this happen?

736
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:41,697
No

737
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:20,698
The road is so near and in the night
it seemed so far away, isn't it?

738
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:27,908
The road, which we were madIy trying
in finding out tllI yesterday

739
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:30,576
Today, I feeI llke crying
after seeing it

740
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:33,920
You'll go some where
I'll go some where

741
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:37,719
WllI you meet me
in DeIhi?

742
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,592
Even if you don't want to meet, atIeast
say yes,to make me happy

743
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:44,394
AtIeast I wllI wait
for you

744
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:46,867
Rashmi, Why are you taIking
llke this?

745
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:55,542
When I came to Mt.Abu, I never thought
I was going to meet someone suddenIy -

746
01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:57,878
Who'll take my feet off
the ground

747
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:01,948
But, this has happened

748
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:05,682
Ever since I have met you, I don't know
what has happened to me?

749
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:13,291
Telling you all this, doesn't mean that
I am asking something in return -

750
01:07:14,663 --> 01:07:18,155
If I had gone mad after someone
it is not necessary that-

751
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:20,224
That someone eIse shouId aIso be
mad after me

752
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,077
Look, the girI is
the same one

753
01:08:13,055 --> 01:08:14,181
But who is with her?

754
01:08:28,804 --> 01:08:31,034
Raj, they are the
same rogues

755
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:34,167
Look there, the camera in his
hand is mine

756
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:35,501
Raj Iets go

757
01:08:47,857 --> 01:08:49,415
What? Where did you spend
the whoIe night?

758
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:51,125
With this cock

759
01:08:58,434 --> 01:08:59,492
We were staying together
in the hoteI

760
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:03,338
We share everything in eating
drinking and all other things

761
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:04,999
Etc...Etc...Etc...

762
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:09,270
PIease return back
the camera

763
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:11,275
No, Raj I don't want
the camera

764
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:13,672
She doesn't want
the camera

765
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:15,248
What do you want?

766
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:20,848
Come on babe, say it into
the ears of baba

767
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:24,289
Come on, I'll never reveaI it
to anyone

768
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:25,958
I swear by him

769
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:29,254
Look, Mister there is a llmit
for everything -

770
01:09:30,266 --> 01:09:32,291
Its better for you, not to
cross the llmit

771
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:36,494
Otherwise, What wllI
you do?

772
01:09:39,475 --> 01:09:40,442
What wllI you do?

773
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:43,209
Me! What can I do...

774
01:09:43,946 --> 01:09:46,847
At the most I can kick
you between the Iegs.

775
01:10:42,471 --> 01:10:43,028
Stop!

776
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:00,584
Look there, Raj!

777
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:01,317
Run

778
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:27,200
Look, didn't I tell you that
I'll come

779
01:12:28,377 --> 01:12:29,401
That too in styIe!

780
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:30,669
Oh Yes!

781
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:45,760
Do you know that yesterday,
he saved my llfe

782
01:12:46,395 --> 01:12:50,559
Yesterday my bus had a fIat tyre and
4-5 rowdies surrounded me...

783
01:12:50,733 --> 01:12:51,961
Enough...Enough..
enough..

784
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:55,033
It seems to be Iong winding taIe
it may need a Iot of time to hear

785
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:56,730
Anyway are these peopIe going
to stay here onIy?

786
01:12:57,272 --> 01:12:59,763
No, No, We are in the hoteI
