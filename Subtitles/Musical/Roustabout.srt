Hi. How are you?

24
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,644
- What took you so long?
- We found a new short cut.

25
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,084
- We'll have beer.
- You'll also have cokes.

26
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,369
- House rules for minors.
- We're over 18.

27

Sure you are, clear.

28
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,123
How come they call this place
a tea house, clear?

29
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,602
It's something that was in
and now is almost out,

30
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,889
so we'll rename it
something further in or further out.

in San Francisco,

didn't misunderstand him.

44

- Uh-huh.

- No. Just stay out of trouble.

- I'm not asking, I'm telling.

Remember, we've always got
an empty cell in there.

- It has a back seat.

I'm sorry.

153

I could have let you rot in there!

154
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,166
Bailing me out
doesn't mean you own me.

00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,411

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,369

183
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,324
(Engine revving)

184
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,481
Those fresh kids
think they own the world!

185
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,007
Don't pay any attention
to him, Cathy.

186
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,048
You're kinda pretty, you know that?

187
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,603
- What are you doing?!
- Let him get by.

188
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,001
Somebody's got to teach him a lesson.

189
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,161
- Want to go for a ride with me?
- You fresh punk!

190
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,528
Cut it out! It's not his fault
you have a hangover.

191
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,965
Bah!

192
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,005
Hey, stupid! It's a public road!
Didn't you know that?

193
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,607
Yeah? My aim must be getting bad.
I thought I hit you.

194
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,967
- Joe, you'll kill him!
- Ah, he won't get hurt.

195
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,407
Stop it, please!

196
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,610
- I'm not gonna let him pass me!
- Oh, stop it! For heaven's sake!

197
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,642
- Stop! Stop!
- It wasn't my fault!

198
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,451
He's supposed
to know how to drive it!

199
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,209
Well, he's moving, isn't he?
He's all right.

200
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,771
(Woman) Are you all right?
(Girl) He's bleeding!

201
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,968
Get the first aid kit. Hold this.

202
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,410
Yeah... Oh, great. That's all I need.
What kind of crazy stunt was that?

203
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,769
You hotshot motorcycle kids, more of
you ought to be run off that highway.

204
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,083
- You're asking for it!
- Easy. Joe got carried away.

205
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,164
- Somebody will carry him away!
- I said sorry.

206
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,208
- He didn't.
- I'm not going to!

207
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,251
You're acting like a kid. We can talk
or you can blow off steam.

208
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,881
There's nothing to talk about!
You're gonna pay for this bike.

209
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,440
- You talk big!
- We have enough trouble.

210
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,602
- Trouble I made?!
- She didn't say that.

211
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,809
- That's what she meant!
- That's exactly what I meant!

212
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,601
I hate to break up a family argument,
but who's gonna pay for this?

213
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,842
<i>I'll</i> send somebody back
for your bike.

214
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,366
- Who?
- Some men from the carny.

215
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,886
- Carny?
- The carnival. I own it.

216
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,406
We're setting up
at the picnic grounds.

217
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,290
- What about this?
- <i>I'll</i> buy a new one.

218
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,328
Get into the Jeep.

219
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,166
OK. Just don't try
to pay me off in cotton candy.

220
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,804
- Let me give you a hand.
- Get your hands off her.

221
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,281
- Easy, pop.
- Don't call me pop.

222
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,409
Mom? Just kidding. Just kidding.

223
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,565
Maggie, you get in the back.
I want Cathy up here with me.

224
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,568
- My name's Charlie Rogers.
- OK.

225
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,611
- Look, I didn't do nothing.
- My name's Cathy Lean.

226
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,648
Cathy, turn around.

227
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,768
(Man) Hey, Joe!

228
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,647
Where do you want the platform
for the skin show?

229
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,291
- Isn't it staked out?
- Yeah, but we're not sure.

230
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,523
Oh, can't you guys
do anything right? Come on.

231
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,525
- This place don't show much.
- Wait till you see it at night.

232
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,331
- Hope I don't have to.
- You'll be around for a while.

233
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,609
They're not big with Japanese
motorcycle parts out here.

234
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,650
- Show him around. <i>I'll</i> park.
- OK.

235
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,528
If I'd known he was a kook,
I wouldn't have buzzed him out there.

236
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,568
He's not a kook.

237
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,407
Sure. Everybody goes around knocking
guys off bikes just for looking.

238
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,847
He's my father. He worries about me.

239
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,888
She worries about him.

240
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,440
Everyone needs somebody
to worry about them.

241
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,010
Mm-hm.

242
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,641
- They're good friends.
- Oh, sure.

243
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,051
Oh.

244
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,248
Aw, what did I say this time?

245
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,891
- It's what you didn't say.
- All right.

246
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,602
If I take my foot out of my mouth,
will you show me around?

247
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,251
All right.
I don't know where to start, but...

248
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,288
What's with this tennis court?

249
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,524
The lines show where to stick front
end, pig iron and butchers' shops.

250
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,329
How's that?

251
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,085
The concessions,
rides and candy stands.

252
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,049
Oh, I see.

253
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,088
What's this over here?

254
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,689
- What's a hot wagon?
- Generator truck.

255
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,721
- Drome? That's the...uh?
- It's right over there.

256
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,088
- High wall, motorcycle stunts.
- Mm-hm.

257
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,648
This wouldn't happen to be...?

258
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,690
Donniker, exactly
what it sounds like. The rest room.

259
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,364
- Grease joint?
- Hamburger stand. Right over here.

260
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,647
What are the big fans for?

261
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,088
They blow the smell of onions around.
Makes people hungry.

262
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,764
Pretty good.

263
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,207
Here we have the Mugg Joint.
Photo gallery.

264
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,602
"You don't know how you look
till you get your picture took.“

265
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,048
Uh-oh. Just what I thought.
The Dirty Show.

266
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,691
Not what you're thinking.
They throw baseballs

267
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,889
- and knock a girl into a water tank.
- What's dirty about that?

268
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,850
The lot lice
get their jollies from it.

269
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,163
Look, I know I'm supposed to know,
but what's lot lice?

270
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,722
- Customers who don't spend.
- Why don't you speak English?

271
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,724
For the same reason doctors
write prescriptions in Latin.

272
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,007
To keep us separate
from earth people.

273
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,844
Earth people?

274
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,447
Civilians, those who aren't with it.
Anyone who isn't a carny.

275
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,969
- What was that for?
- That was for what it was for.

276
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,202
- But why?
- Look...

277
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,090
- You kiss every girl you talk to?
- No.

278
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,084
You kiss the ones you do kiss
this soon?

279
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,640
- Why should I explain...
- I see.

280
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,247
You figure you won't be here
that long. Excuse me.

281
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,370
- We're not through talking yet.
- I am.

282
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,204
Strike one.

283
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,248
She'll be back.

284
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,449
What do you do when you're not
riding around on your bike?

285
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,649
- Besides that.
- I sing a little.

286
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,246
You going to be late
for your next job?

287
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,324
- I don't have one.
- Where were you going?

288
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,324
Phoenix. I got a buddy
that owns a nightclub there.

289
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,890
Where's home?

290
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,008
A little swamp outside of Shreveport.

291
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,402
- Any relatives?
- Not that I can remember, no.

292
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,371
- How old are you?
- Are you making out a police report?

293
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,523
I like to know what my money's
being invested in.

294
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,128
It's being invested in a new guitar
and a bike with a bent front end.

295
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,328
I'm stuck here until it's fixed.

296
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,767
<i>I'll</i> bet you're broke.
How will you eat?

297
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,365
<i>I'll</i> manage.

298
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,807
How about a job here
until your bike is fixed?

299
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,090
- I could use a good roustabout.
- Me, work in a circus? no.

300
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,731
It's a carnival.
There's a big difference.

301
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,450
- OK.
- How about it?

302
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,126
This is hard work...
On second thought, forget it.

303
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,250
- You're too soft for real work.
- Hey, just a minute.

304
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,210
OK, but I'm not biting the heads
off any chickens.

305
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,567
That went out 20 years ago.

306
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,530
A little muscle everywhere.
We all do everything here.

307
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,887
What about Joe?

308
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,645
He won't bother you
if you don't bother Cathy.

309
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,961
That's the whole idea.

310
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,008
That's your problem.

311
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,687
Hey, Maggie!

312
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,966
Where do I sleep?

313
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,805
Over there.
Last trailer on your left.

314
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,848
Now you're a roustabout.

315
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,922
Is that good?

316
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,450
OK, here we go, Charlie. All right.

317
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,887
Straight up.

318
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,883
- Got it?
- Yep.

319
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,928
OK, get the pin in.

320
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,809
There.

321
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,531
- Plan on staying?
- Are you kidding?

322
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,207
<i>I'll</i> be out of this sawdust trap
as soon as my wheels are fixed.

323
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,284
This is for guys
who've got nothing better to do.

324
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,445
I like white sheets, bright lights
and a lot of dough in my pocket.

325
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,488
Then you'd better get out quick.

326
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,769
- Sawdust gets in your veins.
- It won't happen to me.

327
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,083
Aren't you guys finished?
<i>I'll</i> take care of that.

328
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,243
Go help Estelle in the mitt camp,
then report back.

329
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,722
- What's a mitt camp?
- The palmistry tent, over there.

330
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,249
One thing I like about you, Joe,
you got a very likeable way.

331
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,245
- Cody, let's get this other one up.
- OK, here we go.

332
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:12,403
- Hey, don't you believe in knocking?
- How do you knock on a tent?

333
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,448
What's your name, beautiful?

334
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,602
Charlie Rogers, handsome.
What's yours?

335
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,288
(Exotic accent) Professionally,
I am known as Madame Mijanou,

336
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,203
but you can call me Estelle.

337
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,729
I'd rather call you Madame Mijanou.
What do you do here?

338
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:33,682
- That depends. By day or night?
- I hope you're not a mind reader,

339
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,731
because if you are,
I'm about to get my face slapped.

340
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,046
- I am a seeress.
- A what?

341
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,806
A seeress. Sit down.

342
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,806
I read the past, present and future.

343
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,083
Ah! You are the son of a Roman baron.

344
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,482
You have come to this country
on a diplomatic mission.

345
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,645
You will bring great financial reward
to your native land.

346
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,484
- Right?
- Sure.

347
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,564
But right now I'm a roustabout,
here to give you a hand.

348
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,371
Oh. Which hand
do you want to give me?

349
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:20,129
The left hand, being closest to
the heart, reveals much about love.

350
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,966
Let's forget the fortune-telling.
What do you want me to do?

351
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:28,170
I can tell you what kind of woman
will be attracted to you.

352
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,527
I'm old enough to figure that out.

353
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:35,367
- What do you see in my eyes?
- Maybe I'd better slap your face.

354
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,124
I like you, Charlie.

355
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,250
But do you think maybe
I'm a little too mature for you?

356
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,210
Women are like wine.
They improve with age.

357
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,681
- But you don't drink?
- I'm an alcoholic.

358
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,848
(Man) Estelle!

359
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,442
- Who's that?
- Probably my boyfriend.

360
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,444
- You don't care?
- Not if you don't.

361
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,488
I don't.

362
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,690
(Man) Estelle!

363
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,928
What does he do?

364
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,968
He's a knife-thrower.

365
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,565
(CWghs)

366
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,608
Uh, I think I care.

367
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,604
I've heard of heartburn,
but aren't you going too far?

368
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,166
- What's your gimmick?
- it's legit. What's yours?

369
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,084
No gimmick. I'm just a roustabout.
Charlie Rogers.

370
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,606
- I'm BJ Lewis.
- What's that stuff?

371
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,809
- Gasoline.
- Do you use regular or ethyl?

372
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,211
Whatever I can get.

373
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,282
How do you avoid frying your tonsils?

374
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,842
It's just a matter
of getting used to it. Watch.

375
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,524
I bet you get invited to a lot of
barbecues. How'd you get into this?

376
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,047
- My doctor told me to quit smoking.
- No, seriously.

377
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,841
- I started out as a sword swallower.
- That's nice.

378
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,127
OK, OK, I believe you.

379
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,760
All my life I've been afraid
of everybody and everything.

380
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,128
I thought doing something dangerous
would show people I had guts.

381
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,444
You keep swallowing that and you'll
show them you've got guts, all right.

382
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,046
Anybody can eat fire.
Do you want to learn?

383
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,043
I gag on Spanish rice.

384
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,407
- (Man) Hey, you!
- Yeah?

385
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,448
Down here, stupid.

386
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,488
Look, kid, you'd better grow up

387
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,642
before you pick fights
with grown-ups.

388
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,087
What do you mean, “kid“? I'm 38.

389
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,083
Congratulations.

390
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,924
- You Charlie Rogers?
- Yeah.

391
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,367
Joe's been looking for you. Come on.

392
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,642
Hey, BJ, if I need alight,
<i>I'll</i> let you know.

393
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,688
(Girls giggling)

394
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,402
- Hey!
- What's the matter?

395
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,528
- Bring those back.
- These?

396
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,365
- Don't be funny.
- Come on, reach for them.

397
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,410
- Will you hand us our robes?
- Throw 'em, Billy.

398
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,211
- I can't throw 'em that far.
- Don't come any closer.

399
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,964
He can see under the panels.

400
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,690
- Come on, throw 'em.
- No.

401
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,762
- Go ahead, Billy.
- There.

402
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,889
- Oh, come on!
- I'm turning blue from the cold.

403
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,930
(Charlie) Yeah?
That's my favourite colour.

404
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,162
- Here you go, girls.
- Thanks.

405
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,211
- Is this on your work list?
- Just getting to know the family.

406
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,001
- Joe's at the grab joint.
- Thanks. What's a grab joint?

407
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,844
Hot dog stand.

408
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,046
- You walk me over?
- I'm headed that way.

409
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,442
- Hey. Want to go for a ride?
- Where?

410
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,648
To the moon, if we can get the juice.

411
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,530
- You can't...
- It's ready for a test, isn't it?

412
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,807
Haven't you anything better to do?

413
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,724
- Can't say that I have.
- Joe will be mad.

414
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,643
Joe's mad at the world.

415
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,441
- I don't want to get you in trouble.
- I already am. 27th floor.

416
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,284
All right.

Hey, Cody. You haven't seen
Charlie Rogers, have you?

444
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,010
No, just giving the wheel a trial
spin. Greasing up the cables.

445
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,321
Hey, Cody, bring us down, will you?

446
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,928
Oh, you haven't seen him, huh?
You get your head out of the way.

447
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,844
<i>I'll</i> give him something
to wake him up.

448
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,531
Get him out of there.
Just what do you think you're doing?

449
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,568
Just a little ride. Coffee break.

450
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,883
- Cathy, we open in three hours.
- I'm sorry, Dad.

451
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,282
- You get back to work.
- I asked her to go for a ride.

452
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,648
If it'll make you feel better,
here's a half a dollar.

453
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,405
Look, I told you to go back to work.

454
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,363
I'm telling you flat.
Stay away from my daughter.

455
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,681
I told you I talked her into it.

456
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,048
Maggie can hire tramps
if she wants to,

457
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,646
but you better not get out
of line again.

458
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,444
Well, he never would have known

459
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,444
if you'd just learn
to keep your mouth shut.

460
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,488
Thanks for the try, Cody.

461
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,567
All right, Beeps, hit it.

462
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,610
(Dixieland jazz)

463
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,924
(Barker) Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Step lively, folks.

464
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,971
The show's all on the inside.
See it all, see it on the inside.

465
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:32,648
Step lively, folks. Let's not be
blocking the tent. All on the inside.

466
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,688
Here they come. On your toes.

467
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,846
Here she is, a 26-year-old lovely
little bearded lady from Afghanistan.

468
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,127
Here's my little torch holder,
Louise.

469
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,965
And there, ladies and gentlemen,
standing before you,

470
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,362
is the tallest living
man on this earth!

471
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,204
Ain't that a pretty
little balloon, boy?

472
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,921
Hey, kid, give me that!
What do you think you're doing?

473
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,968
Hey, you!

474
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,767
Anybody like to have
a big beautiful balloon?

475
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,845
And wouldn't this lovely lady like
to know what the future holds?

476
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,242
- How much?
- 50 cents is all it's gonna cost.

477
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,042
How would this lady like to know
about the handsome man in her future?

478
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,363
I already know all about it, brother.

479
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,886
You can't win 'em all.
All right, now...

480
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:44,127
- Well, there it is.
- How long you been doing this?

481
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,567
All my life. My parents were carnies.

482
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,610
- Still gets to you?
- You don't see it?

483
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,763
- It's a carnival.
- Don't hang around too long.

484
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:58,290
- You got your religion, I got mine.
- Your bike will be ready Friday.

485
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,684
- Why so long?
- They don't work tomorrow or Sunday.

486
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,289
Help out on one of those rides.
I've got something to do.

487
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,124
Sure.

488
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,960
Mr Nielsen.

489
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,441
Mrs Morgan, I was coming to see you.

490
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:20,047
- To pull the rug from under us?
- As a matter of fact, I...

491
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,521
...was.
- I'm sorry. That's my job.

492
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,570
I know. “I just pull the switch.
I don't sentence the guy.“

493
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,042
The bank wants to know when
to expect last month's payment.

494
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,884
When I get it.

495
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,804
<i>I'll</i> have to tell them
something more definite.

496
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,123
- Business looks pretty good.
- Could be a lot better.

497
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,646
We've been rained out
four Saturday nights.

498
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,087
It would be a fair season
if we didn't owe you.

499
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,926
That lawsuit could have finished you
if we hadn't come to the rescue.

500
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,801
And delay the day of reckoning. Tell
your thick-skinned friends in Topeka

501
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,408
that their money's a lot safer
if we stay open.

502
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,768
Close us down and they'll get
10 cents on the dollar.

503
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:03,801
The bank would prefer it if the man
who caused the accident was gone.

504
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,167
I'm to blame.
I let the insurance lapse.

505
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,528
Mr Lean was drunk
when he set up that ride.

506
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,571
He's the best man around,
and as long as I'm open, he stays.

507
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,450
- All right, <i>I'll</i> tell them.
- You do that.

508
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,488
I don't think they'll listen.

509
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,847
Three balls a quarter!
Drop the lady in the water!

510
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,491
Yes, sir.
Get your pitching arm going.

511
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,006
Stand back, son. Watch this.

512
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,481
- Try again, sir.
- Dad, can I get a candy apple?

513
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,724
We got a live one!
Every pitch a direct hit!

514
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,964
- (Vendor) Step right up! Yes, son?
- Candy apple.

515
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:58,011
Thank you. Charlie, can you relieve
me here for about 10 minutes?

516
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,208
- How do I get in?
- There.

517
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,648
Step right up. Get your crackerjack,
apples and popcorn, folks.

518
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,167
Peanuts, crackerjack, popcorn and
candied apples. Step right up.

519
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,561
This apple has a worm in it!

520
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,644
There's no extra charge
for the meat. Beat it.

521
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,210
<i>I'll</i> be right back.

522
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,490
(Cathy) Over here. Knock the stuffing
out of a stuffed cat. Try your luck.

523
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,131
You, sir, win a prize for the lady.

524
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,204
Whoops! Hold it, kid.
You're not fast enough.

525
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,851
Hey, kid, come here. Come here.

526
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,366
- Gee, thanks.
- Don't try it again.

527
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,171
- How are you doing?
- I'm getting thirsty.

528
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,801
- Put me on the cold drink stand.
- Carbonated or non-carbonated?

529
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,248
Surprise me, as long as you don't
change the scenery.

530
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,961
Knock the stuffing
out of a stuffed cat. Try your luck.

531
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,409
- She's a real doll.
- Cathy's a good kid.

532
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,643
Look, I don't mean to tell you
how to live,

533
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,007
but I'd stay clear if I were you.

534
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,606
I already got that clue
from big daddy.

535
00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:00,527
I guess he wants her to marry someone
with class...like the tattooed man.

536
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,762
He wants the best for her.

537
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,844
Two crackerjacks, please. Thank you.

538
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,764
So why don't he get her out of here?

539
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,687
Cathy wants to be here. As long
as she is, he can keep an eye on her.

540
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,240
- Yeah. So will I.
- OK, I'm back.

541
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,722
Like I said, we all
do everything here. Where to next?

542
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,451
She's not doing too well
on the cat rack.

543
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,488
- If you think you can do better.
- Sure, I can.

544
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,527
Try it.

545
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,600
Step right up, folks.
You, sir, over here.

546
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,605
Three for a quarter. Try your luck.
Right over here, folks.

547
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,129
- You, sir, try one free.
- Free? All right.

548
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,562
And here we have a winner, folks.
Step up here.

549
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,722
Well, we would, if he had paid.

550
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,167
You're not cut out to be a huckster.

551
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,208
You're not much of a shill, either.

552
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,841
Why don't you give me a try?
I'm pretty persuasive.

553
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,763
So I hear. Good luck.

554
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,242
All right, step over
and throw the ball at the pussycat.

555
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,529
How about you? Right over here.
Only 25 cents.

556
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,570
One lousy quarter it costs you.
Come on, anybody?

557
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,644
What's the matter?
Hey, you, buddy, over here.

558
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,647
Hey, you? You, sir. Hey,
I'm talking to you. Come over here.

559
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,929
- What are you doing?
- Come here. Throw the ball.

560
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,962
I don't want to throw the ball.
Let go or <i>I'll</i> call a cop. Crazy nut.

561
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,601
- He didn't want to throw the ball.
- You were wonderful!

562
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,967
I'm not through yet.

563

- You heard from the bank?

600

Stop worrying.
We'll pay them off eventually.

601
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,446

from the bank here yesterday?

...because of my pleasant personality!
Yeah, I know.

- What's really bothering you?

All right. That bum you hired.

- Not again.
- The kid is trouble!

00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,846
For you or Cathy? He sang
at the cat rack and drew a big crowd.

613
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,888
Maybe he can pull them into the tent.

- Let me be the judge of that!

- Morning. How's your new guitar?
- It'll do.

616
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,884
- That's gracious of you.
- It's a replacement, not a gift.

617
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,521
I came to say how good you were
last night, but forget it!

- What'd I do now?
- What are you so angry about?

619
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,284
Your guitar was smashed.
Maggie bought you a new one.

- OK, OK. Thanks, Maggie.

- You fascinate me.

Yeah? That's the best news

Oh, you mean instead of leading
some secure life like in a carnival?

626
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,250
- But you're alone.
- So is everybody else.

627
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,642
No. Everybody has someone,
some kind of folks.

628
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,927
- Like Joe?
- Joe's all right.

629
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,810
- He's had a rough time.
- Oh, pardon me while I cry.

It might do you some good.

Bring out those beautiful girls!

They're four of the finest dancers
in the world, direct from Paris.

639

Not Paris, Texas.
No, sir. Paris, France.

at the... All right, that's enough!

As I promised you!
Bring out those beautiful girls!

694
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,444
- Charlie.
- Yeah?

695
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,046
- I want to talk to you.
- It's your phone booth.

696
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,487
I was out there. I heard them.
You were great.

697
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,528
I want you to stay on
with a contract.

698
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,127
<i>I'll</i> pay you union scale.
And no muscling rides. Just singing.

699
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,364
- No, thanks. Friday is go clay.
- I don't get it. Why not?

700
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,001
- I don't buy the whole scene.
- I'd pay you more if I could.

701
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,447
- It's not just the money.
- Then what is it?

702
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,046
- I don't want to get involved.
- Oh.

703
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,727
- Just take care of number one, huh?
- That's right. Doesn't everybody?

704
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,326
No. No.

705
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,246
You learn that, you may start coming
alive from the waist up.

706
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,005
You collect strays, Maggie.
You got one in Joe.

707
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,004
Why don't you stop recruiting?
They don't make a family.

708
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:05,084
- What would you know about a family?
- Nothing.

709
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,525
Nothing.

710
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,328
(Man) Come on, 25 cents!

711
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,046
Come on, come on, come on.

712
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,444
Marlene Dietrich did it better.

713
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,410
She's not here...but I am.

714
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,608
Come on in. Glad you stopped by.

715
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,445
There's not much action
around here tonight.

716
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,888
- You're good Iookin', you know?
- No one ever told me.

717
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,327
- Don't be such a...
- Fleegie?

718
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,688
That's the word for hotshot
around this stockade, isn't it?

719
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,604
You don't like
the carny much, do you?

720
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,047
You push it like it was
the marine corps

721
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,441
and mom's home cooking
all rolled into one.

722
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,445
Most of us have to feel that way.
It's all we've got.

723
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,328
You like what you see?

724
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:09,166
There's only 24 hours in the clay.
I gotta stop liking sometime.

725
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,924
Afterwards.

726
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,048
Well, excuse me!

727
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:22,161
- Hey, wait a minute!
- I know. You'll call me.

728
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,561
Cathy! Cathy!

729
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,764
- Cathy.
- Go away.

730
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:30,841
Cathy...

731
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,890
- What are you, a sex maniac?
- That was nothing.

732
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,681
Did she tell your fortune? Did she
say you should spread your charms,

733
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,728
and they will return many fold?

734
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,371
- Well, spread somewhere else!
- Let me explain!

735
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,807
- Oh, leave me alone!
- Oh!

736
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,725
What have you got to say? Weekend
receipts were great. Charlie did it.

737
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,486
Aw, he'll fall on his face tonight.
Nobody comes out on a Monday.

Well, well. Harry Carver.
What are you doing here?

796
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,445
Oh, just a little routine
check on competition.

797
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,569
Who are you kidding?
We're no competition for your show.

798
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,450
You might be if you can
hang on to a kid like that.

799
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,921
He sure packs in
the teenagers for you.

800
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,209
- Thanks. We'll hold on to him.
- Well, you better.

801
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,090
He's the only sign of life
I've seen around here.

802
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:14,848
I've often wondered, why do they
call you “Harry the Undertaker“?

803
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,684
I don't know.

804
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:20,367
I suppose it's cos I wait
for small outfits like yours to die,

805
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,204
and then I buy 'em.

806
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,443
- You buy after you bury.
- Not always.

807
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,570
Carver's Combined Shows
always has room for one more.

808
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:33,122
Would you like an offer
before you go under?

809
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,010
Oh, Harry,
that's awfully generous of you.

810
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,401
Well, thank you. Is it a deal?

811
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,801
No.

812
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,690
- I didn't think so.
- You can't fool me.

813
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:48,527
Under that rough, tough shell of
yours beats a heart of pure rock.

814

Well, thank you,
but sooner or later I get 'em all.

By the way, uh,
you're giving 'em too much butter.

817

- Pretty hot, huh?
- Yeah, pretty hot.

818
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,846

through to 'em in there.

00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:28,404
- That don't mean anything to you?
- Can't say that it does, no.

823
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,131
Carver's Combined Shows.

824
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,490
- I'm a civilian.
- You can keep it. I've got others.

825
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,925
No, thanks.

826
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,527
- We're the biggest in the business.
- Mmm.

827
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:45,571
You mind tellin' me something?
Just how much does Maggie pay you?

828
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,007
No, I don't mind telling you.

829
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,560
#She pays me scale plus more
if I want it.

830
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,722
- If?
- I don't want it.

831
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,326
- Well, why not?
- Because I'm after the hot clubs.

832
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,687
Miami, Las Vegas, LA. You know.

833
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,446
Well, now, we're pretty hot, too.
I tell you what, son.

834
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:06,003
<i>I'll</i> just make you an offer.
<i>I'll</i> give you $300.

835
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:11,051
No. I've already told her
that I don't like carnies.

836
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,441
But if I go that route,
<i>I'll</i> stay here.

837
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:18,208
Well, if you get any second thoughts,
you'll know where to find me.

838
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,248
The job will be waiting for you.

839
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,445
Cathy.

840
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,770
- You going for a swim?
- What difference does it make?

841
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:46,208
- Madame Mijanou busy?
- Look, I wanna talk to you.

842
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,647
- You already did.
- Cathy.

843
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,321
Are you cold,
or do I make you nervous?

844
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,845
Both.

845
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,720
You could get a little closer, you
know? I give off a lot of body heat.

846
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:02,203
You don't have to keep trying to
prove it. Now, if you'll excuse me.

847
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,442
(Sam) And another near miss, folks!

848
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,330
Oh, look at that!
Almost. And he struck out!

849
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,448
Sam, Joe will
replace you in a minute.

850
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,285
Thank you, Cathy. Anybody else?

851
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:16,081
Three for a quarter, folks!
Knock the girl right into the water!

852
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:20,609
How about dunking the girl? Anybody
else? How about you down there?

853
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,489
How come you're doing this?

854
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,961
I'm taking Betty's place.
She's not well.

855
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:30,365
If you're cold now, get dunked
a couple times and you'll freeze.

856
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:34,650
That's show business. Besides, they
couldn't hit the side of a barn.

857
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,961
Please, leave.
Joe'll be here in a minute.

858
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:41,887
Oh, Joe arranged this, huh? So
he can protect you from sex maniacs.

859
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,962
But he'd let you freeze to death.

860
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,850
- Why don't you give up?
- I never give up!

861
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:51,847
Dunk the lovely lady in the water,
folks! Three balls a quarter!

862
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,890
- Relieve you in a minute, Sam.
- OK, Joe.

863
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,483
- Today is Tuesday.
- Yesterday was Monday.

864
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,450
- It's only two clays till Friday.
- That's the rumour.

865
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,088
(Man) Get your popcorn here!

866
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,926
Charlie Rogers. Charlie Rogers
to the skin show, please.

867
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:22,249
- Who you protecting, him or me?
- Me. It's shill time.

868
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,527
I might as well be
peddling door-to-door.

869
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,809
I suppose it would gripe you
if I told you you were doing good.

870
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,087
- You still wanna sign me?
- That's right.

871
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,527
- OK, <i>I'll</i> go.
- That's a sudden change. Why?

872
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,171
I'm stagestruck. The roar
of the crowd goes to my head.

873
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,971
Come to my trailer.
I want to put it in writing

874
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,247
before you change your mind again.

875
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,287
Sit down. Sign there.

876
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,761
Shouldn't you fill in
the blank spaces?

877
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,889
I already have.
Read it if you'd like.

878
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,962
- You knew I'd stay, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

879
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,087
HOW?

880
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,243
Oh, let's just say I borrowed
Estelle's crystal ball.

881
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,322
Maggie, you're too much.

882
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,368
There you are.

883
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,807
Now go on out there
and give 'em hell.

884
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,848
OK, boss.

885
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:16,449
- Dad, what's the matter?
- You stay where you are.

886
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,328
How you doing, Joe?

887
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:27,564
Isn't there a law about contributing
to the delinquency of a minor?

888
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,085
What?

889
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,367
I've been watching you and that kid.

890
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,728
Then you know he's what we need
to get us out of trouble.

891
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,882
If I thought that, I'd give up now.

892
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,930
Let's do this concession.
We'll talk about it later.

893
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,968
- When I'm sober.
- I didn't mean that.

894
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:46,090
I know what's really going on
in your head, even if you don't.

895
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,528
Why not? He's young.
Probably holds his liquor.

896
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,887
If he could rig a ride,
he'd probably rig one

897
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,122
that wouldn't kill the customers.

898
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,851
Joe, that's something
you can't pay for

899
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,810
no matter what you do
or how hard you try.

900
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,848
So forget it.

901
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,404
I have.

902
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,448
Get to work.

903
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:11,570
Move right up here, folks!
I want your undivided attention

904
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:15,690
to one of the greatest games
on the North American continent!

905
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:19,082
Throw the ball and hit the target!
Every time you hit that target,

906
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,527
you sense the great
and unique satisfaction

907
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,921
of dropping the little lady
into the water!

908
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,606
It's a challenge,
ladies and gentlemen!

909
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,967
Try one, sir.
On the house. Fire away.

910
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:34,009
- That's a direct hit!
- But I didn't even hit it.

911
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:37,926
You're very strong. The wind from
that ball dropped her in the water.

912
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,482
Here. Three for a quarter.
How about it, sir? Anybody else?

913
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:45,360
Hey, hey, hey! Here you go.
Give me a dollar's worth of balls.

914
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,841
- Take care of the bankroll.
- Here you are.

915
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,002
Get a load of old Freddie here.

916
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,048
- (Ding)
- A direct hit!

917
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,088
Step right up here!

918
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,322
We got a live one here!

919
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,846
Wait till she gets set.
Fire away. Here we go.

920
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,081
Hah!

921
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,161
(Ding)

922
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,250
- You did it again!
- (Joe) Just a minute!

923
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:11,250
Wait till you get a load of this.

924
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,685
(Ding)

925
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,047
You kill me!

926
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,691
Come on, honey!
You're holding us up!

927
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,651
I hope she can breathe underwater
cos that's where I'm gonna keep her.

928
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,722
Give us a kiss for luck, honey.

929
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,610
Everybody just stand back.
Give me a lot of room here.

930
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,604
Freddie's gonna show you
how this should be clone!

931
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,408
(Ding)

932
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,802
I'm gonna give that broad a bath
she ain't never gonna forget.

933
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,531
- Give us another kiss.
- Douse her once for me!

934
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,965
I will.

935
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,810
(Ding)

936
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,767
Freddie, you oughtta be
with the Yankees.

937
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,888
You ain't seen nothing yet, honey.

938
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:56,363
Now get a load of this.
Come on, honey! You're holding us up!

939
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,169
Achtung!

940
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,241
(Ding)

941
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,410
When are we gonna eat?
I'm so hungry I could eat a lion.

942
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,642
Rrraah!

943
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,200
(Freddie) Come on, honey!
Back on the perch!

944
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,886
(Woman) She's gonna have two baths!
(Freddie) You bet!

945
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:12,927
You all right?

946
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,049
(Woman) Give it to her
for me, Freddie!

947
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,726
- I'm OK.
- (Freddie laughing)

948
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,962
Take your time. I know it's cold.

949
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,247
Hey, stand aside.
Give me a lot of room.

950
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:27,166
You are very good, sir, but, uh, why
don't you give the lady a turn?

951
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:30,961
Oh, I can't take a chance.
She's pitching tomorrow.

952
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:36,444
That's very funny. Anybody else?
Like to hit the target?

953
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,808
Hey. Hey, friend.
<i>I'll</i> quit when I miss, all right?

954
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:43,009
Just a minute, sir.
Let me pick up some of these balls.

955
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:46,926
(Freddie) Don't leave, folks.
I'm just getting warmed up!

956
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,606
- You all right?
- He's good, isn't he?

957
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,286
- <i>I'll</i> be <i>OK.</i>
- <i>I'll get rid of</i> him.

958
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:56,729
Come on, everybody stand back! Let's
see if we can get some action going.

959
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,485
Hey, anybody want to bet?
Who wants to bet?

960
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:02,006
Freddie's got a whole
pocket full of money.

961
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,242
Who wants to bet she don't drown?

962
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,926
10 bucks says
you can't do it twice in a row.

963
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,766
Don't bet with Freddie. He pitches
for the Waterford County Tigers.

964
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:14,970
You're on. Give him $10, Mommy.
There's more where that came from.

965
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,008
Hurry up with the balls!

966
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,651
- Relax, will you?
- You want some more?

967
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:22,803
- 10 bucks.
- Step right to the side. Thank you.

968
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,848
Get a load of this.

969
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,081
(Laughing)

970
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:29,164
That's the end
of this gentleman's winning streak.

971
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,641
- That was a good hit.
- Not hard enough.

972
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:34,326
- I say it was.
- He did something!

973
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,926
Why don't you move on?
You can keep your 10 bucks.

974
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,367
That proves it.
He knows you did something!

975
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:43,604
I paid for these balls. You stand
here where I can keep my eye on you.

976
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,762
- All right.
- (Charlie) Stay where you are, Joe.

977
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,650
- I can handle this.
- (Cathy) Charlie, don't interfere.

978
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,961
Get lost, son.
Nobody argues with Freddie.

979
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,850
You tell him, Mommy.
A lot of room here.

980
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,809
- Here we go!
- (Ding)

981
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,086
(Cheering)

982
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:01,688
Come on, honey, you can shiver more
than that. I wanna get you real wet!

983
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,286
- Two in a row for $10, right?
- That's right.

984
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,328
All right. Here we go.

985
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,641
- (Crowd gasps)
- You know what you just did?

986
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,883
- Forget it. Take another ball.
- That's Cathy up there, Joe.

987
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,724
Keep out of this!

988
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:17,168
I'm a real peaceable man, son,
but I tell you what I'm gonna do.

989
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:21,689
If you're still there after I throw
this ball I'm gonna break your spine.

990
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,968
Give me a little room.

991
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,804
(Crowd gasPs)

992
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:31,248
- (Joe) What are you trying to do?!
- That's your daughter!

993
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:33,402
(Women screaming)

994
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,244
Sam, help me.

995
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:38,244
- Charlie, you all right?
- I'm not through with him yet.

996
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:41,210
- No! You know you can beat him.
- He doesn't know it!

997
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,248
OK, OK!

998
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,527
Thanks, fellas.

999
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,841
Will you take your 10 bucks
and leave?

1000
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,082
All right. Give me the wallet, honey.

1001
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,687
- Haven't you got it?
- What do you mean? I gave it to you.

1002
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:58,084
- Well, it must be here.
- It better be. There's 60 bucks...

1003
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,527
Hey. Gimme the wallet.

1004
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,001
You probably
knocked it off the counter.

1005
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,924
Knocked it off the counter!
You better help me find it.

1006
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,968
Come on, get back so I can find it!

1007
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:11,283
Don't make any trouble.
You don't understand this business.

1008
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:13,727
No, and I don't understand a man

1009
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,849
who would let a pig
do this to his daughter!

1010
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,368
- It ain't here.
- it's gotta be!

1011
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,807
- They stole it!
- Turn him upside-down.

1012
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,281
That wallet's
along ways from here now.

1013
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:27,489
Come on, break it up!
What's going on here?

1014
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:31,326
This bunch of carnies
rigged a fight and stole my wallet.

1015
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,290
He put it on the counter.
Anybody could have taken it.

1016
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,124
Yeah, and I know who.

1017
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,965
- You wanna swear out a complaint?
- He sure does!

1018
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:42,840
- OK, buster. Move along.
- You stay here, Cathy.

1019
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,570
Hah!

1020
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,803
- <i>I'll</i> need you two at the station.
- Come on, honey.

1021
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:56,130
It's all right, folks. Everything's
fine. Go on and have a good time.

1022
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,168
Enjoy yourselves.

1023
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,084
- Hi.
- Can't sleep?

1024
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:03,128
Don't want to.

1025
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,249
- Bad dreams, huh?
- Mmm. Nice dreams.

1026
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:09,483
- But why just dream them?
- Where's Joe?

1027
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,722
He's in jail. They held him.

1028
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,963
Cathy and Maggie have been out
trying to find a bondsman.

1029
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,721
Uh, finders keepers?

1030
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,768
What do you think?

1031
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,764
I think you're hung up
between splitting it with me

1032
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:27,730
and getting a good mark from Cathy
for springing Joe.

1033
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,724
There's nothing like looking
for the best in people!

1034
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:33,167
- Don't be nervous.
- Nervous? I never was.

1035
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,450
Hey! You want 'em selling tickets?

1036
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:43,081
- Now who's nervous?
- Haven't you heard of rooms?

1037
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:45,561
You know,
things with doors and walls?

1038
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:47,608
- And furniture?
- Yeah...

1039
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:51,162
Well, I'd like to,
but I got this problem.

1040
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:54,244
The first girl I had
got me hooked on the outdoors.

1041
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:58,041
The only place that she let me make
love to her was outdoors in a car.

1042
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:02,762
The first time I tried to kiss her,
she said, “Charlie...

1043
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:04,808
"take the top down first.“

1044
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:08,123
- And did you kiss her?
- Three hours later, yeah.

1045
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:11,807
It took you three hours to take
the top down on a convertible?

1046
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,928
It wasn't a convertible.

1047
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,890
Hey... Fine. Fine, Charlie.

1048
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:22,966
But I can guarantee that there are 20
people hiding and watching right now.

1049
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,008
Come on, let's go.

1050
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:28,129
It's too bad.
The time and the feelings match,

1051
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,168
but no dice on your place.

1052
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,764
You louse!

1053
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:36,481
So you'll dream indoors. You know,
the walls and the furniture?

1054
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:37,971
Get out of here!

1055
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,566
- Pleasant dreams.
- You dirt...

1056
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,404
Ooh!

1057
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,683
Cathy?

1058
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,208
Look, I know you're awake.

1059
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:27,363
- (Cathy) What do you want?
- I want to apologise.

1060
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,408
Have you got a list?

1061
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,760
For what I said about Joe.

1062
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,808
Tell me in the morning.

1063
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:39,488
Stop making so much noise.

1064
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,325
- Was that you that started the Jeep?
- Yeah.

1065
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,006
- Where were you going?
- For a ride.

1066
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:47,970
- At three in the morning?
- I couldn't sleep.

1067
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:51,328
- How'd it go downtown?
- They're holding him overnight.

1068
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,607
But he didn't steal anything.
I know it.

1069
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:57,405
Yeah. Good night, Cathy.

1070
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:01,201
I'm heating some coffee.
Do you want some?

1071
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,408
Shy, Charlie?

1072
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,687
Not as long as Joe's on ice, no.

1073
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:09,604
- You never quit, do you?
- No, I never quit.

1074
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,648
You must get your face slapped a lot.

1075
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,768
About 50/50.

1076
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,888
- Well, I said coffee.
- Fine.

1077
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:18,247
- Just coffee.
- OK.

1078
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:27,407
I don't believe
you're all like you talk.

1079
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:29,642
You mean there's a real me?

1080
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:32,690
You oughtta know.
You fight with him enough.

1081
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:36,925
Cathy...

1082
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,207
Get back on
your motorcycle, Charlie.

1083
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,248
What are people supposed to do?

1084
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:46,042
I don't know about other people,
but you're just exercising.

1085
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:47,963
No...

1086
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:50,008
not any more.

1087
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:00,041
You better leave, Charlie, please.

1088
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,327
Why, because it was good?

1089
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,801
Because it isn't right for me.

1090
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:08,167
I'm not a one-night stand.

1091
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,888
I'm sorry, Charlie.

1092
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:17,602
I like you, too,
but you're just passing through.

1093
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,564
Yeah.

1094
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:00,930
Hey, where can I find Charlie Rogers?

1095
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,403
The last trailer back there, but you
better drive all the way around.

1096
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,890
(Driver) Charlie Rogers?

1097
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,928
He's over there washing up.

1098
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,206
- Rogers?
- Yeah?

1099
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:26,841
- We fixed your bike for you.
- It's about time.

1100
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:29,082
- Wanna sign it?
- Yeah, sure.

1101
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:37,646
- What'd you have to do to it?
- Nothing. It was just out of gas.

1102
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:40,963
- No, really, what did you do to it?
- Whole new front end.

1103
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:44,089
New shocks. New headlamp.
Everything. Watch it.

1104
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,128
OK, easy.

1105
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:49,682
- Straighten it out.
- Well, it looks all right.

1106
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:51,728
There you go.

1107
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:54,610
- $140, huh?
- Mrs Morgan paid for it.

1108
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:56,648
Wanna try it out first?

1109
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:59,485
- Yeah. Why don't you follow me?
- All right.

1110
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,964
It's OK, pal!

1111
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,851
- You run that bike pretty good.
- Thanks.

1112
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,888
Could handle one of these?

1113
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,928
I can handle anything on two wheels.

1114
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,162
- In there?
- I've never tried it.

1115
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:35,210
- You wanna see how it's clone?
- OK.

1116
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:37,487
Come on. We'll show you.

1117
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:42,684
Go ahead, Gus.
Come on up here, Charlie.

1118
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:51,482
- You all set, Gus?
- Right.

1119
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:59,849
He's gotta go around
a couple of times to warm up.

1120
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:09,041
The takeoff is just over 40.

1121
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:14,122
He can't run over the cable.

1122
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,407
He sure looked like he was going to.

1123
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:20,451
If he did, he'd fly
right over your head. Relax.

1124
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:28,081
- Easy, isn't it?
- Looks like a pretty rough go to me.

1125
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:31,801
Well, it isn't. The centrifugal force
plasters you up there.

1126
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:34,087
You couldn't fall if you wanted to.

1127
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:37,528
<i>I'll</i> take your word for it.
It's not for me.

1128
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,682
Come on. All you need is guts.

1129
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:44,607
I'm a devout coward. Besides,
I'm on my way downtown to spring Joe.

1130
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:47,604
Lots of luck.
That's more than Maggie could do.

1131
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:49,842
- I found that guy's wallet.
- No kidding?

1132
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:53,720
- Thanks for the show.
- Wait a minute. Watch him come off.

1133
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:09,201
- Wanna try it?
- Like I told you, I'm a coward.

1134
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,282
Ride behind me, then. Dames do that.

1135
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:14,045
- No, thanks.
- Goodbye, clear.

1136
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:20,648
Give me the helmet.

1137
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:40,283
Don't forget,
get it up to 40 before you take off.

1138
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:10,602
Isn't that Charlie's motorcycle?

1139
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:13,570
Don't worry, he's not
gonna leave on us yet.

1140
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:16,405
Well, I don't care anyway.
Of course you don't.

1141
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:19,245
You'd think those idiots
would get enough of that

1142
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:21,482
when they have to do it.

1143
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,528
But that's Ernie and Gus...

1144
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,965
Oh!

1145
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,768
- Ernie, how could you?
- Can I help it if he's crazy?

1146
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,808
Stop worrying.

1147
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,848
Hey, he's up to it, isn't he?

1148
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:42,686
Took me three months
to climb up the first time.

1149
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:53,648
- Hey, what's going on?
- Charlie's in the motordrome!

1150
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,844
- You OK, Charlie?
- Yeah, I'm OK. I'm trying to get up.

1151
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:26,809
- Get his helmet off.
- He looks OK.

1152
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,928
I better get that fuel line.

1153
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,923
- How's the bike?
- I don't know.

1154
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:34,409
How can you be such a big child?

1155
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:37,245
- I'm just lucky, I guess.
- You dropped your wallet.

1156
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,971
He dropped whose wallet?

1157
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:44,088
Isn't this yours?

1158
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:47,130
It belongs to the guy
that got into the fight with Joe.

1159
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:48,361
Charlie!

1160
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:51,569
I found it under the counter,
and I was on my way to turn it in.

1161
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,404
Yeah, that's what he told me.

1162
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:55,642
Charlie, when did you find it?

1163
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:58,963
- Last night.
- And you let my clad sit in jail?

1164
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:03,409
What difference does it make? It just
gave him a few hours to dry out.

1165
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:09,767
That's something
you don't do to another carny fella.

1166
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,882
- You all right, Cathy?
- I'm fine.

1167
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:26,327
(Estelle) Good luck, Charlie.

1168
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:29,244
Hey, Maggie! I want to talk to you.

1169
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:35,290
OK, I handed over the secret plans.

1170
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:38,523
I took the 30 pieces of silver.
Now, what is this?

1171
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,570
Something I guess never touched you,
Charlie - feeling.

1172
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:45,611
For this? A broken-down set-up for
taking money from kids and farmers?

1173
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:48,206
For a man who needs
two women carry him around?

1174
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:51,409
For anything. I pegged you right
the minute I saw you.

1175
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,528
I just didn't want to believe it.

1176
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:57,002
I'm supposed to live up to some
notion of the kind of man you want?

1177
01:14:57,080 --> 01:15:00,687
You're a cruel boy, Charlie.
You must have been hurt pretty badly.

1178
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:03,525
Save all that understanding
for this freak show.

1179
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,365
- You won't say I'm wrong?
- You wouldn't believe me.

1180
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:08,886
- Cathy might.
- Don't stay where you're not wanted.

1181
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,167
Why do you think she's so upset?

1182
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:13,811
You can hold me to the contract,
but you don't have to play a violin.

1183
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:18,363
Wait a minute. You're not by chance
wanted anyplace else, are you?

1184
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,807
You're getting warm.

1185
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,406
- Harry Carver.
- Right.

1186
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:26,689
- So it isn't pride, just money.
- That's right, Maggie.

1187
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,524
I won't hold you.

1188
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:53,924
(Estelle) Joe!

1189
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,088
Just a minute.

1190
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,562
Those cells get cold at night.

1191
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:14,611
But sooner or later they spring you,
even if someone ditches the evidence.

1192
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:17,365
- I'm leaving, Joe.
- Get off the bike.

1193
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,408
Aw, come on. Give me the key.

1194
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,721
You don't have
to prove nothing to me, Joe.

1195
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,768
What are you doing?

1196
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,327
Get up. Get up!

1197
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:38,128
Dad! Dad, stop it!

1198
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:40,725
Dad!

1199
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,448
Do you feel better, Joe?

1200
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:47,126
Get out of here.

1201
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,760
Hey, where can I find Harry Carver?

1202
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:46,446
- Over there in the theatre.
- Thanks.

1203
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:02,848
- Where's Harry Carver's office?
- Upstairs, third floor.

1204
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,285
Thanks.

1205
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:12,808
Here you are.

1206
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:16,723
- I'd like to see Harry Carver.
- Do you have an appointment?

1207
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,962
No, but he gave me his card.

1208
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:23,728
Well, well, look who's here.
File this, please. Come on in, son.

1209
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:25,848
Doris, hold all my calls.

1210
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:28,605
Well, sit down. Sit down.

1211
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:31,729
- Would you like a cigar?
- No, thank you.

1212
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:37,408
- Well, I've been expecting you.
- I didn't expect to be here.

1213
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:40,370
I knew that you couldn't
stay with Maggie and Joe.

1214
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,647
- Especially with Joe.
- I might have.

1215
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:44,688
Yeah, but you didn't.

1216
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:50,129
See, they got the kind of operation
where they say the show must go on.

1217
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:53,647
- And you want to know why, right?
- More or less, yeah.

1218
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:58,248
Around here, there's just one reason
the show must go on. The gross.

1219
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,084
That's why I'm here.

1220
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:03,289
- Let's see, what did we say? $20G...
- 400.

1221
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:07,887
Your memory's as lousy as mine.
It was three.

1222
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:10,725
- Make it 350.
- Now, don't push, son.

1223
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,326
I mean it. I don't care, you know.

1224
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,607
Yeah, you probably don't.

1225
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,684
All right.

1226
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:21,331
- Sign right there at the bottom.
- After I read it.

1227
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:24,847
It's the usual standard sheet.
Eleven weeks.

1228
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:27,890
There's a little paragraph
that says you pay a penalty

1229
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:30,361
of half of what
I've given you if you cut out.

1230
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:31,805
Half?

1231
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:34,042
Well, you left Maggie.
You may leave me.

1232
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:36,327
Nah. I don't like the idea.

1233
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,971
Course you don't.

1234
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,930
But otherwise, it's no deal.

1235
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:47,884
OK.

1236
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:57,884
(Orchestra plays)

1237
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,010
(Fanfare)

1238
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:09,722
Follow me to the biggest
and the greatest show on the midway!

1239
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:13,361
Direct from the banks of the Nile,
the favourite of the pharaohs.

1240
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,568
She zigs, she zags,
the girl never lags.

1241
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:20,646
Three measly little quarters buys you
a chance to see the little girlie,

1242
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:23,405
and I'm gonna
bring her out right now.

1243
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:27,371
And here she comes, the little lady
that does the dance of the pyramids.

1244
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:30,205
The one, the only...Little Egypt!

1245
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:33,602
She walks, she talks, she crawls
upon her belly like a reptile.

1246
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:36,251
That's enough, honey.
Don't give 'em too much.

1247
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:39,369
You there, young man!
Step up and get a ticket.

1248
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:42,649
There you go. You just bought
yourself a trip to paradise.

1249
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:45,690
Who's next, folks?
Plenty of seats on the inside.

1250
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:49,526
It's show time! The big show
right here on the midway!

1251
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:01,168
<i>#</i> I went and bought myself a ticket

1252
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:06,007
<i>#</i> And I sat down
in the very first row

1253
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,929
<i>#</i> They pulled the curtain

1254
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:14,006
<i>#</i> But then when they turned
the spotlight way down low

1255
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:15,889
<i>#</i> Little Egypt came out struttin'

1256
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:19,931
<i>#</i> Wearing nothin'
but a button and a bow

1257
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,561
<i>#</i> Singin' ying Yang

1258
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:28,211
<i>#</i> Ying yang

1259
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,931
<i>#</i> Ying yang

1260
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,844
<i>#</i> Ying yang

1261
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,763
<i>#</i> She had a ruby on her tummy

1262
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:42,971
<i>#</i> And a diamond
big as Texas on her toe

1263
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,690
<i>#</i> She let her hair down

1264
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:50,243
<i>#</i> And she did
the hoochie-coochie real slow

1265
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:53,802
<i>#</i> When she did her special
number on a zebra skin

1266
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:57,646
<i>#</i> I thought she'd stop the show

1267
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:00,963
<i>#</i> Singing ying yang

1268
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,560

<i>#</i> Ying yang

01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:14,888
<i>#</i> She did a triple-somersault

1272
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,769
<i>#</i> And when she hit the ground

1273
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:20,401
<i>#</i> She winked at the audience
and then she turned around

1274
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:24,883
<i>#</i> She had a picture of a cowboy
tattooed on her spine

1275
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:28,601
<i>#</i> Saying, Phoenix, Arizona, 1949

1276
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:30,762

01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:42,370
<i>#</i> She's too busy moppin' and takin'
care of shoppin' at the store

1279
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:50,128
<i>#</i> Cos we got seven kids and all clay

01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:57,326

(Chorus) <i>#</i> Ying yang <i>#</i>

1285
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,487
(Applause)

1286
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:32,084
(Charlie) Real good.

1287
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:39,131
- They trying to tell us something?
- Don't let it go to your head, son.

1288
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:42,010
I've seen 'em do the same
for performing seals.

1289
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:44,287
Why don't you send one out next show?

1290
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:47,284
I'd like to.
You can pay them off in fish.

1291
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:49,966
You got the kids going,
give them an encore.

1292
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:52,407
Nah. Always leave 'em wanting more.

1293
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:58,088
Ladies and gentlemen, step right up!
Try your luck!

1294
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:02,210
It's easy, it's fun, and everybody
wins! Three balls for a quarter!

1295
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:05,250
Hey, mister,
let your little boy try his luck.

1296
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:07,800
- How you doing, Sam?
- Pretty grim.

1297
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:11,248
(Man) Three balls for a quarter!
(Clown) Get your balloons!

1298
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:13,800
- Selling anything?
- It's a blank.

1299
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:16,451
- Don't say a word.
- Wish I didn't have to.

1300
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:18,284
Then don't.

1301
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,408
The bank has a deadline, Mrs Morgan.

1302
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:23,882
You were supposed to make payments
on that judgment against you.

1303
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:25,962
I'm doing the best I can.

1304
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:28,008
Not many young people around.

1305
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,845
I can't drag them in
if they don't want to come in.

1306
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:33,446
You got them for a while
with that singer.

1307
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,887
Your books show some profitable clays.

1308
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:37,928
He isn't with us any more.

1309
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,800
That's too bad. I guess it's going
to have to be a court order.

1310
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:45,168
You can't convince them
we're worth more alive than dead?

1311
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:48,210
I'm sorry, Mrs Morgan.
I wish I could help.

1312
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:51,648
All right. Go on back to that nice,
clean bank of yours

1313
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:55,441
where it looks like nothing bad
or sad or personal ever happens.

1314
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,488
I'm sorry.

1315
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:03,084
- Any luck?
- Nothing.

1316
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,682
Young lady...

1317
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,842
Come in! Come in!

1318
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:17,606
Let me show you
what the gods have in store for you.

1319
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:21,048
Knock it off, Estelle.
You know I don't believe that stuff.

1320
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:24,090
Who does?
But you got anything better to do?

1321
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:27,644
OK.

1322
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:35,567
Come into the occult chamber.
Make yourself comfortable.

1323
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:39,929
Madame Mijanou tells all
about the past, present...

1324
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,810
All right, Estelle.
What do you want to tell me?

1325
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,848
Wait.

1326
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:52,445
For you I see a journey.
Soon. Very soon.

1327
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:56,286
At the end will be
someone very clear to you.

1328
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:58,328
I'm not going anywhere.

1329
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,368
To the Carver Show.

1330
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:04,001
Get your crystal ball fixed.
You're wrong on both counts.

1331
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:08,130
Listen, Cathy, there was nothing
between Charlie and me.

1332
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:10,168
I was willing, but...

1333
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:12,447
he just couldn't see my charms.

1334
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:13,931
So?

1335
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,606
Don't act like I'm talking
about Einstein's theory.

1336
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:18,648
I know how you felt about him.

1337
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:21,963
- Please, Estelle...
- And I know how he felt about you.

1338
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:25,647
- That's why I couldn't get anywhere.
- Honestly, I don't care.

1339
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:27,563
Then go get him back!

1340
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:30,564
- Now, I just told you I don't...
- Not for you.

1341
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:32,608
For the show.

1342
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:35,570
He can wail, and the kids loved it.

1343
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:39,645
There hasn't been a spending teenager
around this place since he left.

1344
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,731
- I couldn't.
- Cathy, he's a louse.

1345
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:46,485
He uses people. Why not use him?

1346
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,449
No.

1347
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:52,889
You've got a family to support, kid,
your clad and Maggie.

1348
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:57,170
And I don't want to go back to
some tea room reading coffee grounds.

1349
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:59,891
Think it over,
but think it over fast.

1350
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:02,486
We're drowning.

1351
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:07,448
(Whistling and applause)

1352
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:23,683
(Chorus) <i>#</i> Big love

(Applause)

1389
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:19,761
They're in trouble, and she's here
to try and get you back there.

1390
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,968
Everybody's not
as big a crook as you.

1391
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:24,008
Well, everybody tries.

1392
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:26,367
Go out there and take a bow. Go on.

1393
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:29,408
(Cheering and applause)

1394
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:42,882
- Hi, Cathy.
- Hello, Charlie.

1395
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:45,725
- You were awfully good.
- Thanks.

1396
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:49,168
Well, I meant better than...
Well, you have a real style now.

1397
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:52,528
- Yeah, well, how are things?
- Everything's fine.

1398
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,841
- How about a cup of coffee?
- Sure.

1399
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:58,561
- Charlie, next show in 15 minutes.
- <i>I'll</i> be there.

1400
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:00,927
- Hello, Mr Carver.
- Well, hello, Cathy.

1401
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,844
How are your folks?
Joe and Maggie, that is.

1402
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:07,641
- They're fine.
- We'll be in the coffee shop, Harry.

1403
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:15,011
- Table, Charlie?
- Not right now, thank you.

1404
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:17,845
I want to show you something.
Come over here.

1405
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:26,880
Well, this certainly is
a far cry from our show.

1406
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:29,247
It's a long drive over here, Cathy.

1407
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:31,971
- I know.
- Well?

1408
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:37,761
The reason I came over was to tell
you I'm sorry about what happened.

1409
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,808
I know Joe made it tough on you,

1410
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:42,645
and I don't blame you
for letting him stew in jail.

1411
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:45,485
You didn't have
to drive over here to tell me that.

1412
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:47,324
Well, I wanted you to know.

1413
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:49,164
How are things with the show?

1414
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:53,040
Maggie says the only suckers left
are the ones still in the business.

1415
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:56,488
- She's right.
- They want new things, new people,

1416
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:58,528
and that's why you were...

1417
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:01,001
Well, I mean, actually,
that's the only way...

1418
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:03,447
Yeah. <i>I'll</i> tell you what, Cathy.

1419
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:08,686
Wait until my last show and we'll
go somewhere and...talk it over.

1420
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:10,922
Oh, wait a minute, Charlie.

1421
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:15,960
The real reason I came over here was
to get you to come back to the show

1422
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:18,008
no matter what I had to do.

1423
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:20,287
But I just don't have the guts.

1424
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:22,328
I wish I did.

1425
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:36,689
I know exactly what's going through
your mind, and the answer is no.

1426
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:38,922
It'll kill Maggie to have to give up.

1427
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:42,004
You're not worried about Maggie.
It's Cathy.

1428
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:46,085
What's your problem? You want the
girl, just say, “Cathy, I love you,“

1429
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:48,049
like the grown-ups do.

1430
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:51,283
You don't have to prove
you're a knight in shining armour.

1431
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:55,251
You're a carny, Harry. A rich one,
but a carny. You should understand.

1432
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:57,891
Well, I do, and I kind of
feel guilty about it.

1433
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:01,726
- But not enough to help, right?
- I feel guilty in comfort.

1434
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:03,962
That's how I got to be a rich carny.

1435
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:07,442
- I'm going back, Harry.
- Oh, no. You got a show to do.

1436
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:10,603
- Oh, the show must go on, huh?
- No, just the money.

1437
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:13,604
I have to leave tonight
to be there first thing tomorrow.

1438
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:18,242
You forget one small detail. <i>I'll</i>
sue you and take half your salary.

1439
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:20,288
- Remember our deal?
- Yeah.

1440
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:23,409
- You paid me $1,050, right?
- Right.

1441
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:25,642
Here's 50. I owe you the rest.

1442
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:29,122
- Hey, I see a lot more in there.
- It's gonna stay in there.

1443
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:30,964
But...

1444
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:57,162
- Are you Maggie Morgan?
- Yes.

1445
01:32:57,240 --> 01:32:59,208
Here you are.

1446
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:03,604
I'm sorry, Mrs Morgan. <i>I'll</i> need
a copy of the current inventory.

1447
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:15,530
- What the hell do you want?
- To help out if I can.

1448
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:19,366
- You should have thought about that.
- I didn't come here to save you.

1449
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:22,728
- Get out of here.
- I can't let Maggie go under.

1450
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,882
I told you to get out of here!

1451
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:32,731
<i>39$.!</i>

1452
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,768
Get out of here!

1453
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:36,808
He had a little accident.

1454
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:40,248
- I'm sorry, but he jumped me again.
- You're damn right I did.

1455
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:42,527
Get out of here or <i>I'll</i> do it again.

1456
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:44,568
- Can I help you?
- Leave me alone.

1457
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:47,007
Why did you come back?

1458
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:51,449
Oh, what's the matter? Why can't you
for once say what you really feel?

1459
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:53,045
You can send this vulture home now.

1460
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:55,646
It's a little late
for you to be a hero.

1461
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:57,882
We can make this place go, Maggie.

1462
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:01,885
As one of the creditors, I'm entitled
to ask what did you have in mind?

1463
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:05,009
I'm buying back my contract.
Here's $1,000.

1464
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:08,801
Will that hold 'em until I can prove
I can make this place pay off?

1465
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:11,167
You mean you're gonna stay here?

1466
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:15,086
- That's right.
- Then I think it might work.

1467
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:17,128
At least it's worth a try.

1468
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:19,362
<i>I'll</i> talk to my people about it.

1469
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:22,568
Good luck.

1470
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:29,365
(Nielsen) You'll be hearing from me.

1471
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:32,171
Is this the only reason
you came back?

1472
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:35,323
Practically. You see, I knew that...

1473
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:37,562
Say it straight, just once.

1474
