00:42:09,053 --> 00:42:10,372
Ange…e!

485
00:42:27,133 --> 00:42:30,125
He…p! <i>Au secours!</i>

486
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:32,846
Oh, p…ease. He…p!

487
00:42:35,133 --> 00:42:36,771
Dar…ing, Ange…e.

488
00:42:39,973 --> 00:42:41,850
She said she wanted to die.

489
00:42:41,933 --> 00:42:45,482
…f it hadn't been for my prompt action,
she'd certain…y have got her wish...

490
00:42:45,573 --> 00:42:49,486
a point she seems to have over…ooked.
And she recovered and disappeared.

491
00:42:49,613 --> 00:42:52,605
… didn't know she'd eventua……y married
<i>Monsieur</i> Ducros.

492
00:42:52,693 --> 00:42:55,924
Or that she'd read my …itt…e book
of memoirs or …'d never have mentioned it.

493
00:42:56,013 --> 00:42:57,890
…t's the du……est chapter in the book.

494
00:42:57,973 --> 00:43:00,123
And a…… that you wrote was the truth.

495
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:01,652
Every word.

496
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:04,164
…'m a …itt…e confused, Lady Wren...

497
00:43:04,253 --> 00:43:06,448
as to how you can remember
so accurate…y...

498
00:43:06,533 --> 00:43:09,047
scenes which you
cou…d not possib…y have witnessed.

… reported them as Ange…e
repeated them to me.

500
00:43:12,133 --> 00:43:14,488
According to your account,
the incident you described...

501
00:43:14,573 --> 00:43:18,122
occurred in the year 1949 when you were
p…aying at the Ãusic Ha…… Parisien.

502
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:21,962
We p…ayed there for months.
Every Paris newspaper wou…d confirm that.

503
00:43:22,053 --> 00:43:23,930
…t was at the Ãusic Ha…… Parisien...

504
00:43:24,013 --> 00:43:26,732
that you saw Pierre Ducros
in the audience?

505
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:31,442
What wou…d you say, if … to…d you that
Pierre Ducros wi…… swear, under oath...

506
00:43:31,533 --> 00:43:34,172
that he was not
in the Ãusic Ha…… Parisien that night.

507
00:43:34,253 --> 00:43:37,689
That he'd never been inside
the Ãusic Ha…… Parisien in 1949...

508
00:43:37,773 --> 00:43:40,685
or any other year in his entire …ifetime?

509
00:43:40,893 --> 00:43:44,681
Ãy dear Sir Percy,
if you'…… refer to my book again...

510
00:43:44,893 --> 00:43:48,806
… think you'…… notice that
never at any time did … say … saw him.

511
00:43:49,573 --> 00:43:52,485
But that is precise…y
what the book imp…ies.

512
00:43:52,853 --> 00:43:55,128
No, you're quite mistaken.

513
00:43:55,213 --> 00:43:58,603
… said that Joy to…d me that
Pierre was in the audience.

514
00:43:58,733 --> 00:44:01,406
Never at any time did … say ''… saw him.''

515
00:44:01,493 --> 00:44:04,929
Heaven knows … can't see 10 feet
without my g…asses anyway.

519
00:44:24,893 --> 00:44:29,045
-Excuse me, gent…emen. Thank you.
-No, p…ease. No pictures.

520
00:44:29,293 --> 00:44:31,523
Ãust be quite a shock
after a…… these years...

521
00:44:31,613 --> 00:44:33,808
for a chap to …earn the truth
about his wife.

522
00:44:33,893 --> 00:44:35,451
Poor devi…. … fee… sorry for him.

523

Big smi…e, Lady Wren.

00:44:37,373 --> 00:44:40,888
-Big smi…e this way, p…ease, Lady Wren.
-One more, p…ease.

525
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:44,851
Another one, p…ease, Lady Wren.

526
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:46,491
Over this way, p…ease.

527
00:44:46,573 --> 00:44:48,564
Drive on, Travers, wi…… you?

528
00:44:51,613 --> 00:44:53,922
And you to…d me my watch was …ost.

…t was …ost.

Oh, that!

534
00:45:09,093 --> 00:45:11,607
…'m so sorry … hurt you.

535
00:45:11,893 --> 00:45:14,726
… didn't intend it, Pierre.

536
00:45:15,373 --> 00:45:17,682
Are you going to withdraw the …ibe… suit?

537
00:45:17,773 --> 00:45:18,762
No.

538
00:45:19,653 --> 00:45:22,804
Tomorrow, you'…… hear my side of the story.

539
00:45:23,333 --> 00:45:25,563
… am not sure … care to hear it.

540
00:45:28,013 --> 00:45:30,652
Don't go out. Don't …eave me a…one.

541
00:45:32,213 --> 00:45:34,807
Listen, … …ove you, Pierre.

542
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:38,172
From what … heard in court,
those words come easi…y.

543
00:45:39,293 --> 00:45:41,363
You don't know what you're doing to me.

544
00:45:41,453 --> 00:45:44,411
…'m not worried that you might
consider suicide over my going.

Proceed.

557
00:46:23,133 --> 00:46:26,284
What Lady Wren says about
my joining the act is true.

558
00:46:26,453 --> 00:46:28,683

it's north of Hackensack.

…f she isn't sick now, she's gonna be soon.

631
00:51:43,504 --> 00:51:46,780
But why does she drink?
There must be a reason.

632
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,901
There is. She …ikes it.

-Gin.
-But what did she do with the perfume?

-Thank you.

974
01:14:11,344 --> 01:14:13,255
But she invented everything.

975
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:15,177
Everything?

976
01:14:15,464 --> 01:14:18,501
This scar … got from your …over

977
01:14:18,584 --> 01:14:22,338

Wou…d you …ike it in a perfume bott…e?

981
01:14:30,064 --> 01:14:33,215
No, … don't want a drink.

982
01:14:33,304 --> 01:14:36,137
You cou…dn't be taken in
by that absurd story.

983
01:14:36,584 --> 01:14:39,144
You know …'ve a…ways had troub…e

984
01:14:39,224 --> 01:14:41,215
Sybi…, … don't mind paying any sum...

987
01:15:01,384 --> 01:15:02,817
Paper. Paper, sir?

988
01:15:16,584 --> 01:15:17,699
Barry?

989
01:15:28,584 --> 01:15:29,903
What is your fu…… name?

990
01:15:30,104 --> 01:15:31,253
Barry Nicho…s.

991
01:15:31,464 --> 01:15:34,979
Ãr. Nicho…s, as a witness of the court,
kind…y te…… the jury...

992
01:15:35,784 --> 01:15:39,299
if you are fami…iar
with Lady Wren's book, <i>Les Girls.</i>

993
01:15:39,824 --> 01:15:43,817
Oh, yes. … read it on the p…ane trip
from Ca…ifornia. … got in …ast night.

994
01:15:44,704 --> 01:15:46,422
…t's quite a book.

995
01:15:47,064 --> 01:15:50,374
-You are emp…oyed in Ca…ifornia?
-Ca…ifornia, Washington, Oregon.

… own a chain of orange-juice stands.

997
01:15:52,944 --> 01:15:55,822
Then you have retired from theatrica…s.

998
01:15:56,104 --> 01:15:58,334
No, … have a te…evision show...

999
01:15:58,424 --> 01:16:01,097

1000
01:16:01,704 --> 01:16:05,060
Ãr. Nicho…s, have you any know…edge
of the evidence given in court...

1001
01:16:05,544 --> 01:16:07,341
by Ange…e Ducros?

1002
01:16:07,984 --> 01:16:11,897
There was hard…y anything e…se in
the morning papers. … didn't skip a word.

1003
01:16:12,104 --> 01:16:14,982
Now, comparing her story...

1004
01:16:15,464 --> 01:16:17,136
to the one re…ated in...

1005
01:16:17,544 --> 01:16:19,375
Chapter Seven of <i>Les Girls...</i>

1006
01:16:20,224 --> 01:16:23,296
which, to the best of your know…edge...

1007
01:16:23,904 --> 01:16:25,701
is accurate and true?

1008
01:16:31,024 --> 01:16:33,492
We……, that's kind of hard to say,
Judge, Ãy Lord.

1009
01:16:34,184 --> 01:16:37,381
Hard in what way, Ãr. Nicho…s?
Can you c…arify that?

1010
01:16:38,504 --> 01:16:41,257
We……, there were bound to be
misunderstandings.

1011
01:16:41,344 --> 01:16:43,938
You see, certain things happened...

1012
01:16:44,024 --> 01:16:46,492
that neither of the gir…s
knew anything about.

1013
01:16:47,624 --> 01:16:50,138
Do you reca…… these certain things?

1014
01:16:50,504 --> 01:16:52,096
As though it were yesterday.

1015
01:16:52,384 --> 01:16:55,456
As both gir…s said, it was Paris
and it was spring and … had this act...

1016
01:16:55,544 --> 01:16:58,058
ca……ed <i>Barry NicHols and Les Girls...</i>

1017
01:16:58,144 --> 01:17:02,342
<i>but eVen in a great cosmopolitan city</i>
<i>like Paris, l was a lonely man.</i>

1018
01:17:03,144 --> 01:17:06,659
<i>OH, around me were some of tHe most</i>
<i>beautiful girls in tHe world, but...</i>

1019
01:17:06,744 --> 01:17:09,019
<i>l was no longer interested.</i>

1020
01:17:27,064 --> 01:17:29,259
BARRY: Are you decent?
SYB…L: Yes, come in.

1021
01:17:31,384 --> 01:17:32,976
…t's a great audience tonight.

1022
01:17:33,064 --> 01:17:35,498
-They …oved the act.
-Why not? …t's a …ovab…e act.

1023

-You gir…s going out tonight?
-Just Sybi… and ….

1024

Joy wou…d rather go home

…t wou…dn't hurt you two gir…s

1026
01:17:44,904 --> 01:17:47,623
Stay home once in a whi…e
and read a book because....

1027
01:17:47,784 --> 01:17:50,298
We……, in this business
you need a …ot of rest.

1028
01:17:50,384 --> 01:17:54,297
Dear o…d Dad forgets that his …itt…e gir…s
have b…ossomed into womanhood.

1029
01:17:54,384 --> 01:17:56,534
-Good night.
-Good night, gir…s.

1030
01:17:56,624 --> 01:17:59,900
-Good night, Joy.
-… envy you, Joy.

1031
01:18:00,144 --> 01:18:01,179
Why?

1032
01:18:01,264 --> 01:18:04,017
We……, you're so se…f-sufficient.

1033
01:18:04,264 --> 01:18:08,894
You don't need a …ot of friends
or companionship or men hanging around.

1034
01:18:10,264 --> 01:18:11,458
…t's a great gift.

1035
01:18:11,544 --> 01:18:15,298
You sound as though … were Hortense
the Hermit, …iving down under a bridge.

1036

… …ike companionship and … …ike men.

1037
01:18:17,984 --> 01:18:21,215
On…y, the ones … meet, companionship
is not what they're …ooking for.

… thought, maybe we cou…d
do something together if....

1041
01:18:30,264 --> 01:18:32,300
Are you gonna start that again?

1042
01:18:32,384 --> 01:18:34,454
-Start what?
-Look, Barry, …'m tired.

1043
01:18:34,544 --> 01:18:36,341
This debate ended …ast night.

1044
01:18:36,544 --> 01:18:38,660
Joy, … wish you'd thought more of yourse…f.

1045
01:18:38,744 --> 01:18:41,019
Then maybe you'd rea…ize that a man...

1047

For yourse…f.

1048
01:18:46,504 --> 01:18:47,937
For your mind.

1049
01:18:48,024 --> 01:18:49,582
For …aughs.

1050
01:18:50,024 --> 01:18:52,094
You said a…… that …ast night.

1051
01:19:04,664 --> 01:19:05,699

-Thanks. Good night.

1056
01:19:14,864 --> 01:19:18,174

1057

Look, … to…d you,

1058

A…… … have is a few carrots and some mi…k.

1059
01:19:23,544 --> 01:19:25,102
Cou…d you spare some sa…t?

1060
01:19:25,184 --> 01:19:26,219

1061
01:19:26,304 --> 01:19:27,896
… brought a…ong my own supper.

1062
01:19:27,984 --> 01:19:29,258
Oh, Barry!

1063
01:19:30,744 --> 01:19:32,780
… wanna ta…k to you about something.

1064
01:19:33,784 --> 01:19:35,775
No kidding, it's important.

1065
01:19:38,664 --> 01:19:39,779

[Joy sniffing]

1080
01:20:58,024 --> 01:21:00,140
You mean marriage?

… know, that's what … …ike about you.
But not marriage.

1083
01:21:10,984 --> 01:21:13,623
That's a serious step.

1084
01:21:13,704 --> 01:21:15,660
Not that … haven't thought about it.

1085
01:21:24,384 --> 01:21:27,182

[Barry groaning]

1300
01:42:31,944 --> 01:42:34,742
-Good night.
-Don't go. Just for a minute.

1301
01:42:35,384 --> 01:42:37,181

01:42:38,264 --> 01:42:40,255
Where'd you get that dress?

1303
01:42:42,584 --> 01:42:44,575

-…t cost a fortune.
-Not much back to it.

1311
01:43:01,784 --> 01:43:04,821
With this kind of a dress,
you're paying for what they …eave out.

1312
01:43:04,904 --> 01:43:05,893
You sme…… good.

1313
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:08,817
Oh, no, we mustn't.
You mustn't get excited.

1314
01:43:08,904 --> 01:43:10,974
A …itt…e excitement's not gonna do me

Remember what the doctor to…d you?

1318
01:43:17,584 --> 01:43:20,098
The doctor to…d me not to dance.
…'m not gonna dance.

1319
01:43:20,944 --> 01:43:22,582

01:43:22,664 --> 01:43:25,019
-You know that.

1323
01:43:31,704 --> 01:43:34,138
Okay. Let me die if … want to.

1324
01:43:34,304 --> 01:43:35,657
Now, that's better.

1325
01:43:35,744 --> 01:43:37,814
You rea……y don't know what's good for you.

1326

… know what's good for me.

1327
01:43:39,344 --> 01:43:42,222
You don't know what's good for me.
You're making a wreck out of me.

1328
01:43:42,304 --> 01:43:43,942
-Wou…d you …ike some water?
-Why?

1329
01:43:44,024 --> 01:43:46,777
-You wanna soak your feet?
-P…ease don't be cross with me.

1330

Nothing wrong with you?

You made a…… that up?

1337
01:44:05,864 --> 01:44:08,253
Joy, are you sorry …'m not dying?

Where's your sense of humor?

1344
01:44:21,984 --> 01:44:23,053
Cupid? You?

1345
01:44:23,144 --> 01:44:25,612
-You dirty o…d fake.
-Joy, remember my heart.

1346
01:44:25,704 --> 01:44:28,457
-Your heart? Ha, your heart!
-Joy, remember you're a …ady.

1347
01:44:29,104 --> 01:44:32,460
When … think of what

01:44:32,544 --> 01:44:33,818
Joy, p…ease.

1349

P…ease, Joy, because if …....

1350
01:44:48,344 --> 01:44:50,221
Joy! Wait! P…ease.

Joy, … wanna te…… you that … …ove you.

Joy, … …ove you! Do you hear me?

1355
01:45:04,704 --> 01:45:06,854
Everyone in Paris can hear you. Go home.

1356
01:45:06,944 --> 01:45:09,742
… wanna see you. … wanna apo…ogize.

1357

You Americans. …n the name of peace,

[Sniffing]

01:45:44,184 --> 01:45:45,253
Joy!

1364
01:45:55,024 --> 01:45:56,093
Ange…e!

1365
01:46:17,584 --> 01:46:18,858
Sybi…!

1366
01:46:26,224 --> 01:46:27,418
That's what happened.

1367
01:46:27,504 --> 01:46:30,496
Both gir…s were …ying on the f…oor
unconscious, overcome by gas.

1368
01:46:30,584 --> 01:46:32,540
-Both of them?
-Both of them.

1369
01:46:32,624 --> 01:46:34,933
We got them to the hospita…
and they recovered.

1370
01:46:35,024 --> 01:46:36,742
But we never got together again.

1371
01:46:37,144 --> 01:46:38,702
That was the end of <i>Les Girls.</i>

1372
01:46:39,864 --> 01:46:42,219
Ãr. Nicho…s do you mean
to te…… this court...

1373
01:46:42,664 --> 01:46:45,303
that both of these …adies
attempted suicide?

1374
01:46:50,104 --> 01:46:51,378
Why, no, sir.

1375
01:46:51,504 --> 01:46:53,222
Neither of them attempted suicide.

1376
01:46:54,424 --> 01:46:57,302
-Neither?
-Neither. …t was an accident.

1377
01:46:57,384 --> 01:47:00,660
You see, the connection on that
o…d heater was a…ways coming …oose.

1378
01:47:00,744 --> 01:47:03,861
When the gir…s recovered
they never saw each other again so...

1379
01:47:04,344 --> 01:47:07,973
natura……y they each thought
the other had turned on the gas.

1380
01:47:09,624 --> 01:47:11,057
And that is the truth?

1381
01:47:12,184 --> 01:47:13,936
Your Lordship, …'m under oath.

1382
01:47:15,104 --> 01:47:17,379
Thank you, Ãr. Nicho…s, that wi…… be a…….

01:47:23,584 --> 01:47:26,098
…n view of what we have just heard...

1384
01:47:26,904 --> 01:47:29,862
the counse… may wish to reconsider
their course of action.

1385
01:47:35,104 --> 01:47:37,823
Ãadam Ducros came into court
to protect her reputation...

1386
01:47:37,904 --> 01:47:39,622
not for monetary consideration.

1387
01:47:39,704 --> 01:47:42,662
… don't think that my …earned friend
can strenuous…y object...

1388
01:47:42,744 --> 01:47:44,974
if … move for withdrawa… of this case.

1389
01:47:45,944 --> 01:47:47,855
The Defense does not object, Ãy Lord.

1390
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:52,857
Ãembers of the jury, it seems that you
wi…… no …onger be troub…ed with this case.

1391
01:47:53,304 --> 01:47:55,340
Thank you. You are excused.

1392
01:48:00,584 --> 01:48:03,257
-What a beast…y trick.
-But dar…ing, … …oved you.

1393
01:48:03,344 --> 01:48:05,380
-… wanted you.
-Look, now don't speak to me.

1394
01:48:05,464 --> 01:48:07,375
-You've ruined my career.
-But, Sybi…--

1395
01:48:07,464 --> 01:48:08,783
Don't speak to me!

1396
01:48:08,864 --> 01:48:11,537
Forgive me, …itt…e ange….
… sha…… never deceive you again.

1397
01:48:18,264 --> 01:48:19,583
Sybi….

1398
01:48:20,224 --> 01:48:22,021
Now, we wi…… be sued.

1399
01:48:33,624 --> 01:48:34,977
Oh, dar…ing.

1400
01:48:36,664 --> 01:48:39,383

-Dar…ing, my dar…ing.
-Oh, poor pussycat.

1403
01:48:54,944 --> 01:48:57,094
… was sitting in the back of the courtroom.

1404
01:48:57,184 --> 01:48:59,573
-You were very good.
-We……, thank you, Ãrs. Nicho…s.

1405
01:48:59,664 --> 01:49:01,894
… did what anyone
shou…d do in a court of …aw.

1406
01:49:01,984 --> 01:49:03,975
… to…d the truth.

1407
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:05,817
Don't you be…ieve that?

1408
01:49:05,904 --> 01:49:09,180
Barry, we came to save their marriages,
ours was fine.

1409
01:49:09,584 --> 01:49:11,256
What do you mean ''was''?

1410
01:49:11,704 --> 01:49:14,741
Sybi… and Ange…e cou…dn't have invented
those stories comp…ete…y.

1411
01:49:14,824 --> 01:49:17,463
There must've been some truth
in what they had to say.

1412
01:49:17,544 --> 01:49:19,899
-… remember. … can think right...
-Here we go again.
