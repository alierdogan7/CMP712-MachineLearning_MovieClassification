- I can't. I promised Jud.

172
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:13,741
- Why ever did you?
- 'Cause Curly's too fresh and too bigheaded...

the last minute to ask me.

174

Aunt Eller, are you really going
with Curly tonight?

175
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,484
I sure am.
You didn't want him.

176
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,860
But you could go with me and Jud.

00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:34,813
on account I was scrawny
and flat as a beanpole.

324
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,944
But then I kinda
rounded up a little...

325
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,990
- and now the boys act different to me.
- What's wrong with that?

326
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:42,491
Nothing's wrong.
I like it!

327
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,653
I like it so much
when a fella talks pretty to me...

328
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:47,357
I get all shaky
from horn to hoof.

329
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:49,729
- Don't you?
- Can't think what you're talking about.

330
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:53,565
Don't you feel kinda sorry for a fella
when he looks like he wants to kiss ya?

331
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:58,234
Well, you can't just go around kissing every man
that asks ya. Didn't anyone tell you that?

332
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,706
Yeah, they told me.

It's like I told you, Laurey,
I get sorry for 'em.

383
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:04,794
And now that old Will
has to come home.

384
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:08,457
First thing you know, he'll start talking
pretty to me and changing my mind back.

385
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:11,797
- But Will wants to marry you.
- So does Ali Hakim.

386
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:14,929
- Did he ask you about marryin'?
- Not directly.

387
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,939
But how I know this,
he said this morning...

388
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,976
that he wanted for me to ride with him
to the end of the world.

389
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:24,481
Well, if we drove only as far as "Catoosy,"
he couldn't bring me home till morning...

390
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:26,516
and that means
a wedding, don't it?

391
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,711
Not to a peddler, it don't.

00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:50,637
Remember what you told me? You said
that eggbeater you sold me would beat up eggs...

396
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,768
wring out dishrags, turn the ice cream freezer
and I don't know what all.

397
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:57,439
- Now, Aunt Eller, just listen.
- Don't you Aunt Eller me, you little wart. I'm mad.

398
00:31:57,548 --> 00:32:01,314
If the eggbeater don't work,
I give you something just as good. A present.

399
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,387
I wouldn't have it.

400
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:07,891
- What is it?
- Real silk. Made in Persia.

401
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:10,859
What would I do with
an old Persian garter?

402
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:13,624
It looks pretty.
Now gimme the other one.

403
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:17,360
Which one? Oh, you want to buy

I can let you have it for 50 cents.

406
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:25,135
Do you want me to get that eggbeater
and ram it down your windpipe?

407
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:27,143
- Gimme that.
- Howdy, Aunt Eller.

408
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:29,338

Lace around the bottom
and there are bows running in and out.

411
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,688
Well, I never wear 'em myself,
but I sure do like to look at 'em.

412
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:44,353
- How about these?
- Yeah, they's all right if you ain't goin' no place.

413
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,858
Don't nobody want to buy something?

414
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,663
How about you, Miss Laurey?
You must be wanting something...

Me? Of course
I want something.

417
00:32:56,941 --> 00:33:00,934
I want a buckle made out of
shiny silver to fasten onto my shoes.

418
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:05,948
I want a dress with lace.
I want perfume. I want to be purty.

- I wanna smell like a honeysuckle vine.
- Give her a cake of soap.

I want things
I can't tell you about.

00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:15,085
Not only things to look at
and hold in your hand...

00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:17,491
but things
to happen to you...

423
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:23,033

happen to you, your heart would quit beating.

Here, read what it says
on the label.

You take a deep breath,
and you see everything clear.

430
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:44,745
That's what pharaoh's daughter used to do
when she had to decide what dress to wear...

431
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,120
or which prince
she ought to marry.

432
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,125
She would take a whiff of this.

433
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,991
- I'll take a bottle of that, Mr. Peddler.
- Oh, precious stuff.

Come along, Laurey. Maybe we can
find him something to eat and drink.

- About what you meant...

440
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:16,245
when you said that about drivin' with me
to the end of the world.

441
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,822
Well, I didn't really mean
to the end of the world.

442
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:20,823
Well, then how far
did you wanna go?

443
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:25,553
About as far as say... Claremore.

- What's at Claremore?
- The hotel.

if you blew on them.

646
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:02,224
I just did blow on one of mine,
and it broke into a million pieces.

647
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:05,301
Ain't she funny?
[Laughs]

648
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:07,393
Oh!

649
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:11,031
- Stop that!
- [Indistinct Arguing]

650
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:13,200
- Stop it!
- Gertie!

651
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:15,972
Go on up the house
and cool off!

652
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,206
Get along! Mind!

653
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:23,181
Don't forget tonight at the auction,
Curly, mine's the biggest hamper!

654
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:25,186
[Laughs]

655
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:35,631
So that's that old Cummings gal
I heared so much talk of.

656
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:39,896
- You seen her before, ain't ya?
- But not since she got so old.

657
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:43,234
Never did see anybody get
so peaked-lookin' in such a short time.

658
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:47,606
Yeah. Says she's 18.
Ha! Bet she's 19.

659
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:54,115
Are you really gonna drive
to the box social with that Jud fella?

660
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:57,744
- I reckon so. Why?
- Oh, nothing.

661
00:50:57,854 --> 00:51:00,220
It's just that everybody seems
to expect me to take you.

662
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:03,087
Then maybe it's just
as well you ain't!

663
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:06,128
We don't want people
talkin' about us, do we?

664
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,823
Do you think people
really do talk about us?

665
00:51:08,932 --> 00:51:11,662
Well, you know how they are,
like a swarm of mud wasps...

666
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:13,861
always gotta be buzzing
about something.

667
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:16,905
What are they saying,
that you're stuck on me?

668
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:21,341
Uh-uh. Most of the talk
is that you're stuck on me.

669
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:23,572
Can't imagine how these
ugly rumors start.

670
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,630
Me, neither.

671
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:25,581
Me, neither.

672
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:33,319
#Why do they think up stories that link
my name with yours #

673
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:39,521
#Why do the neighbors gossip all day
behind their doors #

674
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:46,797
# I know a way to prove
what they say is quite untrue #

675
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:50,100
# Here is the gist
a practical list #

676
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:52,607
# Of "don'ts" #

677
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:56,338
# For you #

678
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:01,875
# Don't throw #

679
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:06,012
# Bouquets at me #

680
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:09,183
# Don't please #

681
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:13,251
# My folks too much #

682
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:16,332
# Don't laugh #

683
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:20,426
#At my jokes too much #

684
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:26,169
# People will say we're in love #

685
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:30,610
- Who laughs at your jokes?
- # Don't sigh #

686
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:34,548
#And gaze at me #

687
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:37,586
#Your sighs #

688
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:41,282
#Are so like mine #

689
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:44,326
#Your eyes #

690
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:47,362
# Mustn't glow like mine #

# People will say we're in love #

692
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:58,331
# Don't start #

# Give me my rose and my glove #

#They're suspecting things #

# People will say #

# Love #

# Some people claim
that you are to blame #

701
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:36,342
#As much as I #

702
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:38,880
#Why do you take
the trouble to bake #

703
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:42,509
# My fav'rite pie #

704
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:45,918
# Grant in' you wish

00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:52,892
#Just keep a slice

#You give so free #

# Don't praise #

# My charm too much #

710
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:10,678
# Don't look #

# So vain with me #

# Love ##

730
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:41,664
Don't you think you could tell that Jud fella
you'd rather go with me tonight?

731
00:55:41,771 --> 00:55:44,763
Curly-

732
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:47,342
No, I couldn't.

733
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:50,811
Oh, you couldn't.

734
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:53,382
Think I'll go down to the smokehouse
where Jud's at.

735
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:56,975
See what's so elegant about him, makes
all the girls want to go to parties with him.

736
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:59,419
<i>- Curly!</i>
- What?

737
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:02,692
Nothin'.

738
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:10,865
[Quacking]

739
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:21,669
<i>[Knock At Door]</i>

740
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:23,769
Well, open it, can't you?

741
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:30,180
Well, what do you want?

742
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:33,847
Oh, l- I done got through with my business
up there at the house.

743
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:36,289
I just thought I'd pay a call.

744
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:40,690
<i>- You got a gun, I see.</i>
- That's right.

745
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:43,561
It's a Colt.45.

746
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:45,566
Oh.

747
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:50,371
Say, now.

748
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:54,204
That there pink picture-
That's a naked woman, ain't it?

749
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:57,143
Plumb stark naked as a jaybird.

750
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,374
Shucks, that ain't a thing
to what I could show you.

751
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:05,650
Well, that's
a good-lookin' rope.

752
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,723
Feels good too.

753
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,993
[Grunts]

754
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,859
That's a good, strong hook
you got there, Jud.

755
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:21,734
You know what?
You could hang yourself on that.

756
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:24,602
- I could what?
<i>- You could hang yourself.</i>

757
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:29,670
Yes, sir.
Easy as rollin' off a log.

758
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,270
Why, in five minutes
or less, with good luck...

759
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:35,476
<i>- you could be dead as a doornail.</i>
- What do you mean by that?

760
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:39,521
Oh, then folks would
come to your funeral.

761
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,681
- And they'd sing sad songs.
- [Scoffs]

762
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,691
Why, they would.

763
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:47,285
You never know how many people like you
till you're dead.

764
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,698
You'd be laid out in a parlor.

765
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,030
All decked out in your best suit.

766
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:56,367
Your hair combed down slick,
high starched collar.

767
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,374
Lots of pretty flowers
all around you.

768
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,376
Would there be flowers,
you think?

769
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,378
And palms too-

770
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,142
all around your coffin.

771
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:09,810
Folks would gather round,
and men would bare their heads.

772
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:11,978
Women would sniffle softly.

773
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:13,988
Some probably even faint-

774
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:16,320
ones that took a shine to you
whilst you was alive.

775
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:18,656
Now, what women
ever took a shine to me?

776
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:20,991
Why, lots of women.

777
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:23,156
Only they never come right out
and tell you how they feel...

778
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:25,826
unless you die first.

779
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:28,335
I guess maybe you're right.

780
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:31,669
They'd sure sing loud,
though, when the singin' would start.

781
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:33,891
Sing like their hearts would break.

782
00:58:33,926 --> 00:58:36,009
Sing like their hearts would break.

783
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:38,342
# Pore Jud is daid #

784
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:43,010
# Pore Jud Fry is daid #

785
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:49,058
#All gather' round
his cawfin now and cry #

786
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:53,858
# He had a heart of gold #

787
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:58,195
#And he wasn't very old #

788
00:58:58,301 --> 00:59:04,035
# Oh, why did sich a feller
have to die #

789
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:08,805
# Pore Jud is daid #

790
00:59:08,912 --> 00:59:13,315
# Pore Jud Fry is daid #

791
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:18,444
# He's lookin' oh, so peaceful
and serene #

792
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:21,285
#And serene #

793
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,827
# He's all laid out to rest #

794
00:59:24,928 --> 00:59:29,331
#With his hands
a crost his chest #

795
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:35,098
# His fingernails
have never been so clean #

796
00:59:37,106 --> 00:59:39,666
And then the preacher'd
get up, and he'd say-

797
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:43,678
Folks, we are gathered here to moan
and groan over our brother Jud Fry...

798
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:47,341
who hung hisself up
by a rope in a smokehouse.

799
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:50,351
And then there'd be weepin' and wailin'
from some of those women.

800
00:59:50,453 --> 00:59:52,353
And then he'd say-

801
00:59:52,455 --> 00:59:55,356
Jud was the most misunderstood man
in this territory.

802
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:57,688
People used to think
he was a mean, ugly fella.

803
00:59:57,794 --> 01:00:01,195
And call him a dirty skunk
and ornery pig stealer.

804
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:05,666
# But the folks
'at really knowed him #

805
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:09,864
Knowed that beneath
them two dirty shirts he always wore-

806
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:14,034
#There beat a heart
as big as all out-doors #

807
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:16,543
#As big as all outdoors #

808
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:19,206
#Jud Fry loved his fellow man #

809
01:00:19,315 --> 01:00:22,148
# He loved his fellow man #

810
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:24,151
He loved the birds
of the forests...

811
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:26,153
and the beasts of the field.

812
01:00:26,255 --> 01:00:28,348
He loved the mice
and the vermin in the barn.

813
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:31,052
And he treated the rats
like equals.

814
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,060
Which was right.

815
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:35,392
He loved all the little children.

816
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:38,399
He loved everything
and everybody in the world.

817
01:00:38,501 --> 01:00:40,401
Only-

818

Well, maybe you will.
Maybe you'll go first.

851

Well...

852
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:57,537
let's see now.

853
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,904
Where'd you work at
before you come up here?

854
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:01,909
Was up by, uh,
Quapaw, wasn't it?

855
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:04,172
That's right.

856
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,680
Lousy they was to me too.

857
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:09,274
Always makin' out
they were better than I was.

858
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:11,285
Always treating me
like I was dirt.

859
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:14,982
So, uh, what'd you do?
Get even?

860
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,927
Who said anything
about getting even?

861
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:21,019
No one I recollect.

862
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:23,360
Just come into my head.

863
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:27,027
If it come to gettin' even with somebody,
I'd know how to do it.

864
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:29,263
You remember the fire
in the Bartlett farm over by Sweetwater?

865
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:32,034
I sure do.

866
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:34,041
It was about five years ago.

867
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:37,271
Burned up the father
and the mother and the daughter.

868
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,280
It was a terrible accident.

869
01:03:39,382 --> 01:03:42,078
That weren't no accident.

870
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,050
Fella told me.

871
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:50,057
Said that the hired hand
was stuck on the Bartlett girl...

872
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:54,061
and one day he found her
in the hayloft with another fella.

873
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:57,189
And 'twas him
that burned the place?

874
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:01,361
Took him weeks to get the kerosene,
buying it at different times.

875
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:04,405
Fella that told me...

876
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:06,407
he made out like
it happened in Missouri...

877
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:09,000
but I knew all the time
it was the Bartlett farm.

878
01:04:09,111 --> 01:04:12,046
What a liar he was.

879
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:16,744
Get a little air in here.

880
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:19,686
You ain't told me yet
what business you had here.

881
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:21,814
We got no cattle to sell
and no cow ponies.

882
01:04:21,924 --> 01:04:23,824
Could be only one other thing
on this farm you could want...

883
01:04:23,926 --> 01:04:25,826
and it better not be that.

884
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:32,666
- That's just what it is.
- You keep away from her, you hear?

885
01:04:32,768 --> 01:04:35,362
You know, somebody
ought to tell Laurey...

886
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:38,201
just what kind of a man you are.

887
01:04:38,307 --> 01:04:41,401
And for that matter, somebody
ought to tell you once about yourself.

888
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:43,410
Curly, you better get out of here.

889
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:47,380
In this country, there's just two things
you can do if you're a man.

890
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:49,383
You can live outdoors is one...

891
01:04:49,485 --> 01:04:51,885
and you can live in a hole
is the other.

892
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:55,048
I set by my horse
in the brush somewheres...

893
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:57,557
and I heared a rattlesnake
many a time.

894

[Imitates Rattlesnake]
He'd go-

895
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:01,926
Scared to death
somebody gonna step on him.

896
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:05,558
<i>- Got his old fangs all ready.</i>
- Curly, you better get out of here!

897
01:05:05,668 --> 01:05:08,330
How did you get to be
the way you are anyhow?

898
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:10,997
Sittin' in here in this filthy hole.

899
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:13,337
Why don't you do something healthy
once in a while...

900
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:17,003
'stead of stayin' shut up here,
a-crawlin' and festerin'?

You ought to feel better now.

906
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:44,701
I wish you'd let me
show you something.

over there...
