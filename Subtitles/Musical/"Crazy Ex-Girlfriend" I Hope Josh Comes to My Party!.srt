(humming)

6
00:00:24,812 --> 00:00:27,117
Hi. Thank you so much for coming.

7
00:00:27,142 --> 00:00:28,625
Hi. You said there was
a... an emergency? What?

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,171
Yeah, yeah, I'm so... Something is wrong

9
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,195
with my garbage disposal

10
00:00:31,345 --> 00:00:32,845
is completely clogged.

11
00:00:32,883 --> 00:00:33,921
I don't know what happened.

12
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:36,226
And I know that, you
know, you're a real fixer

13
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:38,652
from summer camp, wood shop,
making all those lanyards,

14
00:00:38,677 --> 00:00:39,709
so I figured you could help me.

15
00:00:39,734 --> 00:00:41,034
And I know that you're wondering, like,

16
00:00:41,169 --> 00:00:42,368
why haven't I called a service.

17
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,703
Well, one time, I called
a service in New York,

18
00:00:44,705 --> 00:00:46,179
and the handyman stole
my grandmother's necklace

19
00:00:46,217 --> 00:00:48,651
- from Krakow, so I thought never again. 
- WHITE JOSH: Wow.

20
00:00:48,676 --> 00:00:51,744
- Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow! 
- Oh.

21
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:54,195

White Josh. How nice.

00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,507

00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,419
So, uh... so you got a clog, huh?

43
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:34,773
Sure it's not an obstruction,

44
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:36,332
backup? Could be a stoppage.

45
00:01:36,357 --> 00:01:38,624
I... I have no idea.

46
00:01:38,626 --> 00:01:41,360
Let me take a look.

47
00:01:41,362 --> 00:01:44,242
Whoa. There's like a
crapload of chicken in here.

48
00:01:44,632 --> 00:01:46,165
It's almost like you tried to break it.

49
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:49,034
Okay, um, so, while White Josh

50
00:01:49,036 --> 00:01:51,937
is fixing the garbage disposal,
why don't you and I catch up?

51
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:53,105
So, how have you been?

52
00:01:53,107 --> 00:01:54,507
Sorry about Whi-Jo.

53
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:56,742
You know, Valencia is
still not super psyched

54
00:01:56,744 --> 00:01:59,011
about you and I hanging out alone together,

55
00:01:59,013 --> 00:02:01,380
so, in case she finds out I was here,

56
00:02:01,453 --> 00:02:03,335
I can say White Josh was here, too.

57
00:02:03,818 --> 00:02:07,453
Valencia... when she gets mad,
she, like... ugh... hulks out.

58
00:02:07,455 --> 00:02:09,121
But what's she mad about? Like, I don't...

59
00:02:09,123 --> 00:02:10,923
I don't really understand
what she's mad about.

60
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:12,524
Ugh! Are you crazy?!

61
00:02:12,526 --> 00:02:14,159
Why does everyone want to have sex with me?

62
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:17,129
It's a circle of love, because
I love you, you love Josh,

63
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:19,164
and Josh and I used to love each other.

64
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,366
<i>Oh, that.</i>

65
00:02:20,368 --> 00:02:21,934
Yeah. Oh, she's still angry about that?

66
00:02:21,936 --> 00:02:23,168
Oh, my God!

67
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,104
It's like, shake it off, girlfriend.

68
00:02:25,106 --> 00:02:26,739
That was ages ago!

69
00:02:26,741 --> 00:02:28,407
It was six days ago.

70
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:30,542
Well, yeah, I mean, I just
need a buffer, you know.

71
00:02:30,544 --> 00:02:31,744
Yeah. Especially since Valencia's...

72
00:02:31,746 --> 00:02:33,679
She's out of town at some yoga retreat.

73
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:35,180
Oh, she's out of town?

74
00:02:35,182 --> 00:02:37,182
You know, it's so funny that she's so angry

75
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,751
because I've tried to tell her repeatedly

76
00:02:38,753 --> 00:02:40,152
that you and I are just friends

77
00:02:40,154 --> 00:02:41,921
and that I'm really on the hunt

78
00:02:41,923 --> 00:02:43,789
for, like, cute, single guys, you know.

79
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:46,546
It's so hot in here. Aah!

80
00:02:46,571 --> 00:02:49,929
Hey, buddy, if you're gonna
sweat, can you put down a towel?

81
00:02:49,931 --> 00:02:51,830
Oh, sorry. I'm actually...
I'm done, anyway.

82
00:02:51,832 --> 00:02:53,098
Disposal's fixed.

83
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,833
Oh, great. Then we should jet.

84
00:02:54,835 --> 00:02:56,335
Oh. Wait, wait, wait, wait!

85
00:02:56,337 --> 00:02:58,737
Why-why don't we... why don't
we watch a movie, and-and...

86
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:00,572
and Buffer can play with my phone? Hmm?

87
00:03:00,574 --> 00:03:02,675
- Here you go, bud. 
- Ah.

88
00:03:02,677 --> 00:03:04,610
You got a step counter on here?

89
00:03:04,612 --> 00:03:07,382
Whoa! It is very low.
I'm gonna catch you up.

90
00:03:07,407 --> 00:03:09,581
Uh, no, we got to go.

91
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,734
Anyway, don't you have,
like, work or something?

92
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,653
Um, actually, today is Weekend Tuesday.

93
00:03:14,655 --> 00:03:17,089
Yeah, it's like, uh, Casual Friday, but

94
00:03:17,091 --> 00:03:19,320
even more chill and on a Tuesday.

95
00:03:19,345 --> 00:03:20,742
And, um, we make it up

96
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,494
by working Saturdays once a quarter.

97
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,570
That sounds confusing.

98
00:03:23,595 --> 00:03:24,861
I don't disagree.

99
00:03:24,886 --> 00:03:26,819
Uh, yeah, come on, dude, we got to go.

100
00:03:26,844 --> 00:03:28,242
Um, it was great to see you, Becks.

101
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:29,600
You know, glad we could help.

102
00:03:29,971 --> 00:03:31,303
Just a little advice.

103
00:03:31,305 --> 00:03:32,871
Uh, no chicken in the disposal ever.

104
00:03:32,873 --> 00:03:35,307
Also, no fish bones, also, uh, no seeds.

105
00:03:35,309 --> 00:03:37,109
Also, lemons seem bad,
but they're actually good.

106
00:03:37,111 --> 00:03:38,023
Cool.

107
00:03:38,048 --> 00:03:39,999
Thanks for the tips. Thanks
for the help. Uh-huh. Sure.

108
00:03:40,024 --> 00:03:41,924
Uh, put on a shirt 'cause
no one wants to see that.

109
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:43,615
- I'm so sorry. 
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's totally fine.

110
00:03:43,617 --> 00:03:44,875
Yeah, no. No problem.

111
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,799
Sorry. See you, Becks.

112
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,674
- All right. 
- (door opens)

113
00:03:48,723 --> 00:03:50,489
(door closes)

114
00:03:50,491 --> 00:03:52,624
Oh, God.

115
00:03:53,305 --> 00:03:55,007
(whimpering)

116
00:04:04,617 --> 00:04:05,504
Darryl Whitefeather.

117
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:07,473
Hi, Darryl. It's Rebecca.

118
00:04:07,475 --> 00:04:09,617
Listen, I don't know if I'm
gonna make it in to work today.

119
00:04:09,642 --> 00:04:10,774
Oh, why?

120
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,389
I'm just not... I'm not feeling well.

121
00:04:13,414 --> 00:04:15,398
Oh, really? What-what is it?

122
00:04:16,502 --> 00:04:20,571
Um... my ovaries are eking out

123
00:04:20,596 --> 00:04:23,975
into my fallopian tubes,
and they're wrapped around...

124
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,868
You know what? We'll see you
when you're feeling better.

125
00:04:25,893 --> 00:04:27,893
Yeah. Okay, thanks.

126
00:04:27,895 --> 00:04:29,500
Wow. Men are stupid.

127
00:04:30,818 --> 00:04:32,618
(knocking)

128
00:04:32,643 --> 00:04:33,842
Come in.

129
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:35,267
(door opens)

130
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:37,369
PAULA: Darryl said your uterus exploded.

131
00:04:37,371 --> 00:04:39,656
You know, if that's true, should

132
00:04:39,681 --> 00:04:41,450
probably go to the hospital or something.

133
00:04:42,445 --> 00:04:45,511
I know what this is. This is Chan-itus.

134
00:04:45,513 --> 00:04:48,480
Again, I just moved here
for a change. I didn't

135
00:04:48,482 --> 00:04:49,882
- move here for Josh. 
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

136
00:04:49,884 --> 00:04:52,084
- Yeah, yeah. I got it...
- West Covina. Pretzel...

137
00:04:52,086 --> 00:04:53,585
- Got it. 
- Okay.

138
00:04:53,587 --> 00:04:55,654
Fine. You know, I'll admit it.

139
00:04:56,367 --> 00:04:57,990
I want to be his friend.

140
00:04:57,992 --> 00:05:00,392
Okay? Sue me. But now his

141
00:05:00,394 --> 00:05:02,661
stupid, dum-dum-face
girlfriend

142
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:05,597
has officially barred him
from being alone with me.

143
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:07,232
Yeah, I saw that coming.

144
00:05:08,135 --> 00:05:09,906
I don't know what to do.

145
00:05:09,931 --> 00:05:12,598
Well, that's okay, 'cause I do.

146
00:05:12,623 --> 00:05:13,855
Huh? Oh, come on.

147
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,580
It's a classic dilemma.

148
00:05:15,605 --> 00:05:17,538
How do you see your crush...

149
00:05:17,563 --> 00:05:20,079
I mean, friend... without
pissing off his girlfriend,

150
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:24,483
and look fabu in a super-tight
low-cut dress in the process?

151
00:05:24,485 --> 00:05:26,685
There's a solution, a loophole.

152
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:29,195
It is in every teen movie ever made.

153
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:31,471
It's a car wash?

154
00:05:31,496 --> 00:05:32,962
Throw a big party!

155
00:05:34,531 --> 00:05:35,752
- No. 
- What?

156
00:05:35,777 --> 00:05:37,468
Yes, throw a big party.

157
00:05:37,493 --> 00:05:38,726
That way, when Josh comes,

158
00:05:38,751 --> 00:05:40,317
you're not technically alone with him,

159
00:05:40,342 --> 00:05:42,578
- and then he can't get in trouble! 
- Okay, I see your logic...

160
00:05:42,674 --> 00:05:45,265
Very sound logic, um, but I don't do that.

161
00:05:45,406 --> 00:05:47,773
I don't throw parties.
It's not a thing I do.

162
00:05:47,798 --> 00:05:50,507
- I go to parties. 
- Okay. Why?

163
00:05:50,578 --> 00:05:52,644
(sighs) Oh, God, um...

164
00:05:53,148 --> 00:05:55,460
it's, like, a super long story.

165
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,117
Okay, um, ooh...

166
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:00,304
- So, when I was 12... 
- PAULA: Okay.

167
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:01,695
No, no. I don't have time for this.

168
00:06:01,922 --> 00:06:04,359
What happened? The tissues
fell out of your training bra?

169
00:06:04,384 --> 00:06:07,052
You period-ed on a white
couch? We've all been there.

170
00:06:07,495 --> 00:06:11,296
I period-ed on an ultra suede settee in 1987

171
00:06:11,298 --> 00:06:13,398
at Roberta Janatelli's condo, and

172
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,648
I got to tell you, it
was still a great party.

173
00:06:16,686 --> 00:06:18,819
I wrapped a sweater around my waist,

174
00:06:18,844 --> 00:06:21,945
then hooked up with Bobby Henderson anyway.

175
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,837
And started the whole, um,

176
00:06:23,862 --> 00:06:25,762
sweater-around-the-waist
trend while I was at it.

177
00:06:25,813 --> 00:06:26,992
So, you're welcome.

178
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:29,292
Paula, you don't
understand what I am saying.

179
00:06:29,317 --> 00:06:31,451
I need you to listen to me, okay?

180
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:35,382
This was the worst party of all time.

181
00:06:35,756 --> 00:06:39,124
<i>So, I invited everyone in my
grade to come over to my house</i>

182
00:06:39,126 --> 00:06:40,993
<i>and watch the pay-per-view
concert of my favorite</i>

183
00:06:40,995 --> 00:06:42,461
<i>boy band, Room Temperature.</i>

184
00:06:42,463 --> 00:06:43,996
<i>So, I threw this party,</i>

185
00:06:43,998 --> 00:06:46,101
<i>and this is how many people showed up.</i>

186
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,098
(dinging)

187
00:06:48,202 --> 00:06:49,868
Concert starts in ten minutes!

188
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,257
Who's psyched?!

189
00:06:52,617 --> 00:06:53,672
Well,

190
00:06:53,674 --> 00:06:55,908
<i>that was a tepid response.</i>

191
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,609
(laughs) Get it?

192
00:06:57,781 --> 00:06:59,478
It's a temperature joke.

193
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,979
<i>And then it happened.</i>

194
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:03,448
WOMAN: Keep your voice
down. She's having a party.

195
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,515
MAN: You call that a party? That's
her and her three loser friends.

196
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:06,906
You couldn't even throw her a decent party!

197
00:07:06,931 --> 00:07:08,530
WOMAN: Well, then why
don't you call your whore

198
00:07:08,555 --> 00:07:09,922
and ask her what she would do?!

199
00:07:10,421 --> 00:07:14,226
Um, they're just rehearsing a play called

200
00:07:14,228 --> 00:07:15,585
<i>The Worst Parents Ever.</i>

201
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,611
It's going up at the
Westchester Community Playhouse.

202
00:07:18,636 --> 00:07:19,734
That's it. I've had it.

203
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,844
Hey, I'll get you
tickets. Who wants tickets?

204
00:07:21,869 --> 00:07:23,101
If you walk out that door,

205
00:07:23,103 --> 00:07:24,336
I don't ever want to see you again!

206
00:07:24,338 --> 00:07:25,470
Is that a promise? Yes!

207
00:07:25,472 --> 00:07:26,872
Can I get that in writing?! Yes!

208
00:07:39,034 --> 00:07:40,093
Good luck, kiddo.

209
00:07:42,507 --> 00:07:43,685
I got to get out of here.

210
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,457
WOMAN: Don't you dare.

211
00:07:45,482 --> 00:07:48,083
Don't you dare.

212
00:07:50,927 --> 00:07:52,085
(yelling): Don't you dare!

213
00:07:52,126 --> 00:07:52,984
(door closes)

214
00:07:54,235 --> 00:07:56,068
(panting)

215
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,617
(door closes)

216
00:07:58,554 --> 00:08:00,620
(voice breaking): Don't tell anybody

217
00:08:00,645 --> 00:08:03,695
at school about this, okay?

218
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,623
Oh, my God.

219
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:10,656
It's the root of all my party fears.

220
00:08:11,187 --> 00:08:13,719
Actually, it's the root
of all my fears, period.

221
00:08:14,054 --> 00:08:17,756
Babe, you don't think
that I get being afraid?

222
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:21,193
I wake up every morning in cold sweats

223
00:08:21,195 --> 00:08:23,562
worried that I'm wasting my entire life

224
00:08:23,564 --> 00:08:26,171
with a man who spends all his
time with a barbershop quartet

225
00:08:26,196 --> 00:08:28,304
called The West Brovinas.

226
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:30,218
- No, you never told me the name. 
- Yes.

227
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,081
And my children... I
mean, their only hope is

228
00:08:32,106 --> 00:08:34,350
that they get into a really good gang.

229
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,242
I mean, honey, I am scared
every day of my life.

230
00:08:37,244 --> 00:08:39,687
But you can be brave. I know you can.

231
00:08:39,712 --> 00:08:43,617
All you got to do is stand up
to your fears, do you understand?

232
00:08:43,717 --> 00:08:45,812
I understand you in theory.

233
00:08:45,837 --> 00:08:48,520

332
00:12:49,237 --> 00:12:50,502
why don't you put on that sombrero

333
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:52,507

00:12:59,413 --> 00:13:02,214

to do is choose a theme.

00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:32,478
Hey, what have I said about
the katana on the table?

352
00:13:33,921 --> 00:13:34,780
Or...

353
00:13:34,782 --> 00:13:37,650
you could just stare at
me like a serial killer.

354
00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:39,051
Scott?

355
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:41,882
- Scott! 
- (humming)

356
00:13:44,632 --> 00:13:45,982
- Scott! 
- Huh? Huh?

357
00:13:46,007 --> 00:13:47,860
What? Sorry. We have
the semifinals coming up

358
00:13:47,862 --> 00:13:49,061
against the Glendorables.

359
00:13:49,063 --> 00:13:50,863
They're the a-cappella group from Glendora.

360
00:13:50,865 --> 00:13:53,832
- They're the best in the state. (humming) 
- Okay, I'm looking

361
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,434
for that white tablecloth that we have,

362
00:13:55,436 --> 00:13:56,635
the one with the roses on it.

363
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:58,037
- Yeah, I saw it. 
- (gasps) Great!

364
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,054
- Where is it? 
- I threw it out. (humming)

365
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,367
Wait! You threw it out? 
That was from our wedding.

366
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,542
I gave it to Goodwill when you asked me

367
00:14:03,544 --> 00:14:04,777
to clean out the cabinet.

368
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:06,445
Okay, well, if I asked you

369
00:14:06,447 --> 00:14:07,713
to take out the recyclables,

370
00:14:07,715 --> 00:14:09,048
would you throw out our wedding album?

371
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,383
'Cause it is partly made of paper.

372
00:14:11,385 --> 00:14:12,785
I don't know what you're asking me.

373
00:14:12,787 --> 00:14:15,646
(humming)

374
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:17,189
You know, the world doesn't
revolve around barbershop.

375
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:19,725
Nothing revolves around barbershop!

376
00:14:20,218 --> 00:14:22,428
Not even a revolving barbershop pole

377
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,064
revolves around barbershop.

378
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:26,432
This damn teacher. Teacher's...

379
00:14:26,434 --> 00:14:29,301
(groans) Stupid...

380
00:14:29,726 --> 00:14:30,769
What's up, Tommy?

381
00:14:30,771 --> 00:14:33,305
I have a test tomorrow, and I
don't know any of this stuff.

382
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:34,807
I'm stupid.

383
00:14:35,156 --> 00:14:36,975
You are not stupid.

384
00:14:37,218 --> 00:14:39,645
You are in the highest
percentiles of kids with ADHD

385
00:14:39,906 --> 00:14:42,481
and OCD and SAD and a panic disorder

386
00:14:42,483 --> 00:14:44,116
and restless leg syndrome...

387
00:14:44,118 --> 00:14:46,618
Mom, I'm gonna fail the test.

388
00:14:47,031 --> 00:14:49,221
You're not. I know you're not.

389
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:52,078
Look, just, you know, don't be afraid

390
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,804
and-and face your fears.

391
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:57,625
Run with scissors, you know?

392
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,164
What?

393
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,333
That's bad advice, Mom.

394
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,704
<i>REBECCA (singsongy): Hey!</i>

395
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,312
It's a house warming, get it?

396
00:15:11,835 --> 00:15:14,146
Yeah. No, I get it. I get it. It's just,

397
00:15:14,148 --> 00:15:16,982
you know, it kind of
looks like you're going

398
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:19,852
- to light your house on fire. 
- No.

399
00:15:19,854 --> 00:15:22,254
- No, I don't see that. Mm-mm. 
- Okay.

400
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:24,256
Whatever. You know
what, it's gonna be fine.

401
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,500
Do you promise?

402
00:15:26,976 --> 00:15:29,194
Yes, I promise.

403
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:30,829
You got this.

404
00:15:31,203 --> 00:15:33,507
Okay? You are a smart,

405
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,234
confident woman

406
00:15:35,236 --> 00:15:38,117
who's in charge of her own destiny.

407
00:15:38,742 --> 00:15:40,220
That sounds like a tampon
commercial. But you know...

408
00:15:40,245 --> 00:15:41,078
you know where I'm going
with this, right?

409
00:15:41,103 --> 00:15:41,851
Yeah. Yeah.

410
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:43,509
Okay, now, who you gonna pass these out to?

411
00:15:44,085 --> 00:15:46,178
Oh, come on, you know
people. You know people

412
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,014
since you've been here. You
go to that spinning class.

413
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:51,727
You have people in your apartment complex.

414
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:55,210
Yeah... No, no, you're right.

415
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:56,437
Now that I'm thinking about it,

416
00:15:56,462 --> 00:15:57,860
I definitely know a lot of people.

417
00:15:57,885 --> 00:15:58,684
Tons of people.

418
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:00,075
I'm psyched! (chuckles)

419
00:16:00,194 --> 00:16:02,060
God, this time's gonna
be totally different.

S-Sorry, what was that?

Have you seen Josh Chan?

462
00:17:45,755 --> 00:17:48,185
Nah, but you're lookin' sweet.

463
00:17:48,974 --> 00:17:50,911
Thank you, young man.

464
00:17:52,645 --> 00:17:54,456
I'm lookin' sweet.

465
00:17:54,481 --> 00:17:56,200
(sighs)

466
00:17:59,575 --> 00:18:00,812
Hi, Greg.

467
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:02,948
Put those things away. You're
gonna poke a kid's eye out.

468
00:18:03,224 --> 00:18:05,317
(chuckles) You're funny.

469
00:18:05,778 --> 00:18:08,747
You're funny in that way that
I'm sure other people like.

470
00:18:08,772 --> 00:18:11,317
Wow. Charming on you looks really great.

471
00:18:11,374 --> 00:18:13,959
Okay, let's start over. Look, I
know that you're probably

472
00:18:13,961 --> 00:18:17,029
a little, like, miffed at me
from the way things went down

473
00:18:17,031 --> 00:18:18,411
at Spiders the other night.

474
00:18:18,436 --> 00:18:20,933
Um, as I remember it, you weren't
too thrilled with me either.

475
00:18:20,935 --> 00:18:23,635
I was gonna apologize for
that, and then I forgot.

476
00:18:23,637 --> 00:18:25,003
But I'm sorry.

477
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:27,105
So let's just move on. I'm here

478
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:30,809
to invite you to the
biggest event of the season.

479
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:32,644
A party.

480
00:18:32,646 --> 00:18:34,613
Wow. A flyer.

481
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:36,648
Is it also, like, a church bake sale, too?

482
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:39,885
It's gonna be so fun. And I actually...

483
00:18:39,887 --> 00:18:41,520
I really would like you to come.

484
00:18:41,522 --> 00:18:43,455
Let's review. We've been out twice.

485
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:46,725
The first time, we kissed
and then you started crying.

486
00:18:46,727 --> 00:18:49,261
The second time, you kissed
a girl, she didn't like it,

487
00:18:49,263 --> 00:18:52,331
and she left crying. We don't
have a good track record here.

488
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,666
Dude, like, that actually
really hurts my feelings,

489
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:57,502
because I consider you to be
one of my best friends here.

490
00:18:57,504 --> 00:18:59,237
- What? 
- Yeah, I do.

491
00:18:59,825 --> 00:19:02,738
True, we've had some “altercations,”

492
00:19:02,763 --> 00:19:03,675
if that's what you call them,

493
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:05,444
yeah, but that's the hallmark

494
00:19:05,446 --> 00:19:07,052
of, like, a strong friendship, you know?

495
00:19:07,263 --> 00:19:10,626
Saying the worst possible
things to each other

496
00:19:11,075 --> 00:19:13,485
and then going to a party.

497
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:14,720
Wow. It is so tempting.

498
00:19:14,722 --> 00:19:16,755
It is so tempt... No.

499
00:19:17,138 --> 00:19:20,511
Okay. Wow. Okay.

500
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:22,630
You know, I tried extending
the olive branch to you,

501
00:19:22,935 --> 00:19:25,896
and you just took those
olives and you plucked 'em

502
00:19:25,989 --> 00:19:28,646
and you chopped them up into
a tapenade of reproach...

503
00:19:28,911 --> 00:19:30,636
You know what, never mind. 
I don't care anymore.

504
00:19:30,638 --> 00:19:32,404
Um, good-bye.

505
00:19:32,406 --> 00:19:33,538
(exhales)

506
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,040
(quietly): Face your fears.

507
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,057
Hey, Josh, do you want to come to a party?

508
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:47,474
I'm throwing a...

509
00:19:47,499 --> 00:19:49,232
party. You should come.

510
00:19:49,257 --> 00:19:50,864
No way! That's awesome!

511
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,333
Yeah. See? This is

512
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,341
how a human being responds

513
00:19:55,366 --> 00:19:57,224
to another human being's party invitation.

514
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:58,563
- You're not a human being.
- Oh, just throw a barb

515
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:00,298
at me and then go to the
stockroom. Real mature.

516
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,533
He's so immature. Sorry about that.

517
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,036
We have kind of a... like, a
Sam and Diane thing going on,

518
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,239
except it's, um, unpleasant and un-sexy.

519
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:09,407
Yeah, so it's just gonna be a...

520
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:12,410
housewarming shindig
with a-a gaggle of peeps.

521
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:14,679
And I thought that, you know,
Valencia would be cool with it

522
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:16,748
since we won't technically be alone.

523
00:20:17,356 --> 00:20:18,783
- Right?

to me for, like, 11 years,

and, like, I say “guy,” but honestly,

556
00:21:31,825 --> 00:21:33,691
it could be, like...

557
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:36,667

- Okay.

559
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:40,164

myself a bridge builder,

560

undercurrent of resistance,

- What time should I come over?

574

Wait. You want to come?

00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,692
Why, thank you, madam.

582
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:31,148
Yeah, see, like that.

701
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:14,408
- Don't panic. How long do we have? 
- We have 20 minutes.

702
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:16,543
He texted me that he would
be here in 20 minutes.

703
00:27:16,545 --> 00:27:18,527
I'm gonna, I'm gonna call
him, and I'm gonna say

704
00:27:18,552 --> 00:27:19,880
that the party's canceled...
That's the easy solution.

705
00:27:19,882 --> 00:27:22,549
- I'm just gonna say the pa... 
- No. No, no. Hey, no! We are not gonna

706
00:27:22,551 --> 00:27:24,284
give in to fear... We're gonna stand up.

My advice works...

708
00:27:26,153 --> 00:27:28,403
damn it, and I am gonna prove it.

709
00:27:28,745 --> 00:27:29,911
- Where are you going? 
- I'm gonna be back

710

in 19 minutes with guests, lots of 'em.

Oh, yeah. But actually,

717
00:27:43,772 --> 00:27:45,772
I lit a cigarette using a gas burner.

718
00:27:45,774 --> 00:27:47,507
So not very smart, right?

some of that weird
garbage disposal chicken,

743
00:28:38,394 --> 00:28:40,227
um, and I'm not feeling so hot,

744
00:28:40,229 --> 00:28:41,695

- Hello. 
- It's so good to see you.

- Welcome. 
- Uh, thanks.

751
00:28:54,476 --> 00:28:56,060
Nice to see you.

752
00:28:56,085 --> 00:28:58,378
Do you want to maybe go 
for a walk around the block?

753
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,113
I have to go get some cigarettes.

754
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:01,248
I'm a smoker.

755
00:29:01,692 --> 00:29:03,450
Yeah, big smoker.

757
00:29:04,687 --> 00:29:05,986
What?

Whoa.

Okay, so...

764
00:29:21,582 --> 00:29:24,016
it's more of, like, an intimate soiree...

765
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:25,840
now, because I thought that a party

766
00:29:25,944 --> 00:29:27,357
would be too tacky.

767
00:29:27,786 --> 00:29:29,342
(sighs): Um...

768
00:29:29,965 --> 00:29:32,123
No, that's not what I thought.

769
00:29:32,148 --> 00:29:35,349
Okay, so you know how I, I
wanted to throw this big party?

770
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:37,014
Uh-huh. I handed out a ton of flyers...

771
00:29:37,555 --> 00:29:38,584
and nobody came.

772
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:41,764
<i>Wait. You're upset... about this?</i>

773
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:44,217
I threw a party...

774
00:29:44,493 --> 00:29:46,193

I know, it's hilarious.

777
00:29:49,975 --> 00:29:54,211
Of course! You just moved
into town, you banana.

778
00:29:54,213 --> 00:29:56,046
Of course you don't have a million friends.

779
00:29:56,048 --> 00:29:57,681
You know, that'd be weird if you did.

780
00:29:57,683 --> 00:29:59,549
If there had been a ton of people here,

781
00:29:59,551 --> 00:30:02,154
it would seem like you just invited
random people you didn't know.

782
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:04,898
- Oh, my God, that'd be so weird. 
- Yeah, totally.

783
00:30:04,923 --> 00:30:06,323
Don't be sad, Becks.

784
00:30:06,325 --> 00:30:08,701
You have a lot of cool
stuff going on in your life.

785
00:30:08,726 --> 00:30:12,128
Great job, um, sweet apartment, plus...

786

You just moved to town,
you throw a big party.

You're fearless.

794
00:30:28,537 --> 00:30:29,870

796
00:30:30,883 --> 00:30:32,048
You know, Becks,

797
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:34,251
if you really wanted
more people at your party,

798
00:30:34,253 --> 00:30:36,386
that's easy... any idiot can do that.

799
00:30:36,388 --> 00:30:37,888
(scoffs)

800
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,589
Is... that what you want?

801
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:42,772
Sweet. Let's do it.

802
00:30:42,797 --> 00:30:44,563
All right, get over
here, guys. You, Dreads,

803
00:30:44,588 --> 00:30:45,988

804
00:30:46,123 --> 00:30:47,722
I need you over... yeah.

805
00:30:47,747 --> 00:30:49,514
You're gonna wear my shades. Awesome sauce.

806
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:51,272
You, Mr. Tall Man, you stand there.

807
00:30:51,297 --> 00:30:54,064
Okay, now the key to a good party selfie

00:30:57,209 --> 00:30:58,608

Good.

812

813
00:31:03,081 --> 00:31:04,209
a killer smile.

Ha-ha! Then we post this puppy online.

819

Exclam-Exclamation point. Ah... send!

822
00:31:22,634 --> 00:31:24,076

call him “this guy”"

I've known him since kindergarten.

834
00:32:11,499 --> 00:32:13,851
Yeah, I'm just so bad in school.

835
00:32:14,007 --> 00:32:16,507
Dude, let me tell you something right now.

836
00:32:16,618 --> 00:32:19,719
Being good at school means nothing.

I was horrible at school,

844
00:32:33,856 --> 00:32:36,957
but that's because instead
of reading their stupid books,

845
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:40,527
I was busy reading everything
Salinger ever wrote.

846

And you're, like, totally
successful and rich now, right?

00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:51,163
Hey, Megan, honey,

878
00:33:51,188 --> 00:33:53,014
let's clean something. (whoops)

879
00:33:57,576 --> 00:33:59,172
GREG: Wow.

880
00:33:59,174 --> 00:34:01,541
This party is a real who's-who of...

881
00:34:01,543 --> 00:34:03,477
who?

882
00:34:03,479 --> 00:34:08,115
Well, if it isn't Mr. I
Can't Come to Your Party

883
00:34:08,117 --> 00:34:11,551
Because I Have a Bunch
of Complicated Reasons,

884
00:34:11,553 --> 00:34:14,354
I Probably Have to Buy More Black Clothing,

885
00:34:14,356 --> 00:34:15,498
Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah.

886
00:34:15,523 --> 00:34:17,056
That's a long name I have. Polish?

887
00:34:18,068 --> 00:34:19,126
All right.

888
00:34:19,128 --> 00:34:21,092
Sincerely, thank you for coming.

889
00:34:21,117 --> 00:34:22,740
It means a lot to me that you're here.

890
00:34:22,765 --> 00:34:24,165
Well, you took all my customers.

891
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,223
I usually get the gamblers
after their meeting.

892
00:34:26,248 --> 00:34:27,447
Then I started thinking,

893
00:34:27,472 --> 00:34:29,005
“I've got to show up to this party to see

894
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,497
in what gruesome way it
could all go wrong.”

895
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,974
I figured at least a porch collapse.

896
00:34:34,154 --> 00:34:35,553
But, now that I'm here...

897
00:34:36,445 --> 00:34:38,545
- It's not that bad. 
- Yeah,

898
00:34:38,547 --> 00:34:40,180
it's pretty great, right?

899
00:34:40,756 --> 00:34:43,201
And I have one person to thank for that.

900
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,592
Hey, girl.

901
00:34:52,594 --> 00:34:54,561
I know that as a kid you never got to see

902
00:34:54,563 --> 00:34:56,530
that boy band concert
on pay-per-view.

903
00:34:56,532 --> 00:34:57,864
But it's okay.

904
00:34:57,866 --> 00:34:59,599
Because I'm here now.

905
00:34:59,601 --> 00:35:02,169
And I'm all the boy band you'll ever need.

is everything okay?

957
00:37:07,735 --> 00:37:09,869
Uh... no, it's...

958
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,193
it's-it's not important.

959
00:37:11,218 --> 00:37:13,319
I-I can get back to them later.

960
00:37:13,343 --> 00:37:15,958
I am having a blast right now.

961
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,241
- Great. 
- Yeah.

962
00:37:17,266 --> 00:37:19,943
- Great. 
- So...

963
00:37:19,973 --> 00:37:21,539
I should go.

964
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:23,674
Tommy just called us an Uber.

965
00:37:23,676 --> 00:37:26,310
'Cause I am... wuz-asted.

966
00:37:26,312 --> 00:37:28,980
Which is a word I just learned

967
00:37:28,982 --> 00:37:31,749
playing pai gow with a charming man

968
00:37:32,051 --> 00:37:33,417
from Azusa.

969
00:37:33,419 --> 00:37:35,987
Boop. (laughs)

970
00:37:36,178 --> 00:37:38,389
You threw a great party.

971
00:37:38,391 --> 00:37:41,492
No. We threw a great party.

972
00:37:41,494 --> 00:37:43,094
(both grunt)

973
00:37:43,096 --> 00:37:44,629
And you...

974
00:37:44,631 --> 00:37:47,053
You are a brave little cookie.

975
00:37:49,325 --> 00:37:53,094
Okay. Come on. Show Mommy
where the front door is.

976
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:55,172
CLERK: Hey, so,

977
00:37:55,174 --> 00:37:56,874
thanks for the party. Real fun.

978
00:37:56,876 --> 00:38:00,154
And I'll see you at the store, Betsy.

979
00:38:00,452 --> 00:38:01,905
Actually, my name is Rebecca.

980
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,463
Don't care.

981
00:38:06,819 --> 00:38:08,529
Hey, um...

982
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:10,388
I saw that you got

983
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,789
a text from Valencia earlier.

984
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:13,591
I hope I'm not causing any problems.

985
00:38:13,593 --> 00:38:15,092
No, no, no, no. I realized,

986
00:38:15,094 --> 00:38:17,361
you know, I-I shouldn't
have listened to her.

987
00:38:17,363 --> 00:38:19,797
I shouldn't be afraid
of my girlfriend, right?

988
00:38:19,799 --> 00:38:20,831
So I told her,

989
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:22,671
“I'll-I'll come home when I want to.”

990
00:38:23,878 --> 00:38:25,952
Actually, it was a little scary.

991
00:38:26,973 --> 00:38:30,307
Yeah. Actually, you know,
I-I faced a fear earlier

992
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:32,777
and turned out pretty okay.

993
00:38:32,779 --> 00:38:35,146
You know, from now on,
uh, since we're friends,

994
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:37,148
we should just, you know, hang out

995
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,749
whenever we want to, don't you think?

996
00:38:38,751 --> 00:38:41,218
Yeah. That...

997
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,754
I mean, yeah. Let's do it.

998
00:38:44,657 --> 00:38:46,757
- The world be damned. 
- All right, yeah.

999
00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:48,726
Wha... It's just...

1000
00:38:50,096 --> 00:38:51,595
- Well, I got to go. 
- Yeah, yeah,

1001
00:38:51,597 --> 00:38:52,663
let's get you out of here. I'll-I'll...

1002
00:38:52,665 --> 00:38:54,565
don't worry about that.

1003
00:38:54,567 --> 00:38:56,801
Oh. It was a great party.

1004
00:38:56,803 --> 00:38:59,236
Thanks. Thank you.

1005
00:38:59,238 --> 00:39:01,872
- This house was on fire! 
- Oh!

1006
00:39:01,874 --> 00:39:04,141
- (laughs) Yeah! 
- Oh, I get it. Oh.

1007
00:39:07,113 --> 00:39:08,436
Later.

1008
00:39:08,518 --> 00:39:10,317
Later.

1009
00:39:10,616 --> 00:39:12,783
Sooner rather than... (laughs)

1010
00:39:16,118 --> 00:39:17,817
(door closes) Uh, hi.

1011
00:39:18,296 --> 00:39:19,575
I didn't know you were still here.

1012
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:21,125
I thought you already left.

1013
00:39:21,127 --> 00:39:23,882
(chuckles) Oh, I don't leave
when there's whiskey left.

1014
00:39:24,087 --> 00:39:25,353
Oh.

1015
00:39:25,378 --> 00:39:26,810
Hey, you know what?

1016
00:39:26,835 --> 00:39:27,801
Take it home.

1017
00:39:27,867 --> 00:39:29,300
That's my gift to you.

1018
00:39:29,302 --> 00:39:30,968
Thank you.

1019
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,303
You know, I get it now.

1020
00:39:32,305 --> 00:39:33,604
What do you get?

1021
00:39:33,606 --> 00:39:35,406
How you feel about Josh.

1022
00:39:35,897 --> 00:39:37,108
I saw it on your face.

1023
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:39,610
It was weird and sad and...

1024
00:39:40,585 --> 00:39:42,012
also kind of beautiful

1025
00:39:42,014 --> 00:39:44,897
in a pure and un-ironic way.

1026
00:39:46,637 --> 00:39:48,203
I don't know what you're talking about.

1027
00:39:48,228 --> 00:39:49,728
Josh and I are just friends.

1028
00:39:49,753 --> 00:39:51,519
You guys are just friends.

1029
00:39:51,544 --> 00:39:53,310
We guys are just friends.

1030
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:55,025
Everyone guys are just friends.

1031
00:39:55,027 --> 00:39:56,894
Okay, okay.

1032
00:39:56,896 --> 00:39:58,022
- Drunkie. 
- Drunkie.

1033
00:39:58,047 --> 00:40:00,314
Let's call you... whoa!

1034
00:40:00,477 --> 00:40:03,311
Let's get a ride-sharing service, right?

1035
00:40:03,336 --> 00:40:05,770
You know, you're really
starting to fit in here.

1036
00:40:05,772 --> 00:40:07,004
Thank you.

1037
00:40:07,006 --> 00:40:09,140
That's not a compliment.

1038
00:40:12,478 --> 00:40:14,046
I can't do this.

1039
00:40:14,071 --> 00:40:16,705
Yes, you can. And I'll
be right here, I promise.

1040
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:18,830
What if I forget all the
stuff I'm supposed to say?

1041
00:40:26,053 --> 00:40:27,892
You are not kicking Tommy out.

1042
00:40:28,303 --> 00:40:29,593
I know what my rights are.

1043
00:40:29,595 --> 00:40:31,629
'Cause I looked 'em up.

1044
00:40:31,631 --> 00:40:35,699
And there is a statute and it is called...

1045
00:40:35,968 --> 00:40:39,103
the fair access rule.

1046
00:40:39,335 --> 00:40:42,499
And if you expel Tommy, then you are...

1047
00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:44,475
liable for a

1048
00:40:44,477 --> 00:40:48,312
$26,000-per year stipend

1049
00:40:48,314 --> 00:40:51,866
for... special education.

1050
00:40:52,678 --> 00:40:56,053
If you drop the transfer hearing,

1051
00:40:56,055 --> 00:40:59,343
then... I will let you off the hook.

1052
00:41:00,014 --> 00:41:01,392
See,

1053
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,468
this is your problem:

1054
00:41:06,065 --> 00:41:08,241
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

1055
00:41:09,236 --> 00:41:10,835
(laughs)

1056
00:41:11,647 --> 00:41:13,737
That is right.

1057
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:16,073
(knocks)

1058
00:41:19,245 --> 00:41:20,678
<i>YOUNG REBECCA: That went well.</i>

1059
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,880
Much better than I thought.

1060
00:41:23,124 --> 00:41:25,655
So tell me some other
stuff about my future.

1061
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,748
Okay, so you're gonna
go to Harvard and Yale.

1062
00:41:28,773 --> 00:41:32,174
Yeah, yeah, so when exactly
do I get those boobs?

1063
00:41:32,686 --> 00:41:35,626
Oh. Um, I think age 14?

1064
00:41:35,628 --> 00:41:36,858
I see.

1065
00:41:37,218 --> 00:41:39,351
So, at Yale, you're
gonna be editor in chief

1066
00:41:39,376 --> 00:41:40,542
of the law journal.

1067
00:41:40,733 --> 00:41:43,067
Sounds great. Back to
the boobs for a second,

1068
00:41:43,069 --> 00:41:44,101
when you say 14,

1069
00:41:44,103 --> 00:41:46,837
are we talking by my birthday party?

1070
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:50,040
Are we talking swimsuit season?

1071
00:41:50,171 --> 00:41:51,775
Also, do they float?

1072
00:41:52,757 --> 00:41:53,663
Yeah.

1073
00:41:53,688 --> 00:41:57,343
Nice! Girl with Mustache
owes me ten dollars.

1074
00:41:58,906 --> 00:42:01,026
