00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:54,064
All right, you devil.
We'll let it go at that.

169
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,650
- Mr. Bigelow, if she said she's...
- You keep out of this.

170
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,570
But I don't want this
to happen on account of me.

171
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,029
- Apologize to her.
- Aha!

172
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:08,620
Me apologize to her? For what?
For giving my carousel a bad name?

173
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,449
A ba... (LAUGHING)

174
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:17,046
The day you bought the carousel,
Mrs. Mullin, it got a bad name.

175
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,126
After all I've done for
you, that's what...

176
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,302
- Now I am through with you.
- Go on.

177
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,012
- And it's for good, do you hear?
- Go on.

178
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,465
Get!

179
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,102
Through for good.

180
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:37,275
And I won't take you back
like I done before.

181
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,444
What will you do now, Mr. Bigelow?

182
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:45,449
Well, first of all, I'll go get
myself a glass of beer.

183
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,702
Whenever anything bothers me,
I always drink a glass of beer.

184
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,912
Then you are bothered
about losing your job.

185
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:55,084
No, only about how
I'm gonna pay for the beer.

186
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,329
Will you pay for it?

187
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,666
You?

188
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:06,926
- How much money you got?
- Forty-three cents.

189
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,424
And you?

190
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:13,807
- I asked you how much money you got?
- (CRYING)

191
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,687
Oh.

192
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,438
You don't need to cry about it.

193
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,985
If you ain't got it,
you ain't got it.

194
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,905
- (CONTINUES)
- Tell her to stop crying.

195
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,074

197
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,325
Well, that's better.

198
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:35,332
I'm going over to the carousel
and get my things.

199
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,707
Hey, you know that
bench down the road?

200
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:43,671
The one by the... By the water,
the last one, by the tree.

201
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,426
I'll meet you there.

202
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,631
And then we'll go see about
having that drink.

203
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:57,518
It's all right. Keep your money.
This time, I'll pay.

I've been bustin' to tell
you something lately.

207
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,438
You have?

208
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,324
The reason I didn't care
to tell you before was...

209
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,828
Well, 'cause you didn't
have a fella of your own.

210
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:16,533
But now that you got one,
I can tell you about mine.

he meant us to wait.

- Yes.

I meant she was to wait.
You can go home.

00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,944
Why, Mr. Bigelow.

If Julie stays,
she'll lose her job.

00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,499
Lose your job 'cause you stay
out late? Where do you work?

At Bascombe's Cotton Mill.

273

we can't go back to work there anymore.

if you ain't home on time?

- It's late, Julie.

pretty young ones like this.

336
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:14,767
Gets 'em all moony eyed,

337
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,811
promises to marry 'em
then takes their money.

338
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,980
I haven't got any money.

339
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:22,317
- That's right. She ain't.
- Oh, you found that out already.

340
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:25,820
Julie, you are a young
and inexperienced child.

341
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,489
And I've decided to give you
one more chance.

342
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,452
I'll take you back to the house myself
and explain everything to the matron.

343
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,078
Come, my child.

344
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,665
Well, don't stand there like
you didn't have good sense.

345
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,868
Do I have to go with you?

346
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:43,546
Well, no, you don't have to.

347
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:47,175
- Then I'll stay.
- After I warned you.

348
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:51,222
You see, Timmany? There are
some you just can't help.

349
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:55,224
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Bascombe.

350
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,269
You. I ought to throw you in jail.

351
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,940
- What for?
- Don't know. Wish I did.

352
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,776
Well, and then what?

353
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,277
Huh?

354
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:14,403
You were telling me a story. You were
just putting out the lights when...

355
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,994
Oh, yeah.

356
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:24,295
Well, just as the lights went out,
someone come along.

357
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,749
It was this little girl,
the one with the...

358
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,094
Tell me something. Ain't
you scared of me?

359
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:35,345
I mean, after what that cop said
about me taking money from girls.

360
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,430
I ain't scared.

361
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:42,439
You're a funny kid.

362
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:47,403
Well, you wanna go
into town and dance?

363
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:51,115
Oh, no. I have to be careful.

364
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:54,155
- Of what?
- My character.

365
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,954
See, I'm never gonna marry.

366
00:24:58,122 --> 00:24:59,330
Huh?

367
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:03,536
Well, a girl who don't marry has
gotta be much more particular.

368
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:06,421
About what? Who she's seen with?

369
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:09,250
Oh, no. No.

370
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,302
About not letting other people
get the wrong impression.

371
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:16,973
See, if... if I was gonna marry,

372
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:20,056
it wouldn't make so
much difference.

373
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:21,887
Oh.

374
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,319
Suppose I was to say to you
that I'd marry you.

375
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,404
You?

376
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:35,033
That scares you, don't it? You're
thinking about what that cop said.

377
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:39,159
No. Why, I never paid
no mind to what he said.

378
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:49,839
Well, you wouldn't marry a fella
like me anyway, would you?

379
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,008
Yes, I would...

380
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,836
If I loved you.

381
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:58,011
Why, it wouldn't make
any difference what you...

382
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,594
Even if I died for it.

383
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,022
Nah.

384
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:09,025
How do you know what you'd do
if you loved me,

385
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:11,354
how you'd feel or anything?

386
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,445
I don't know how I'd know.

387
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:19,077
But I know how it would be...

388
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,700
If I loved you.

389
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,991

00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,703

fella to marry anybody.

Even if a girl was foolish enough
to want me to, I wouldn't.

466
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,435
Don't worry about it, Billy.

467
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,613
Who's worried?

468
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:59,700
You're right about
there being no wind.

469
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:04,706
The blossoms are just
coming down by theirselves.

470
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:13,335
It's just their time to, I reckon.

471
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:57,261
Well, you being Julie's only kinfolk,
I thought you'd want to know.

472
00:34:57,262 --> 00:35:00,389
Ain't seen that barker
from the carousel neither.

473
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,765
He got bounced too.

474
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:06,020
- If you ain't got any better than them...
- Oh, I got better. I got better.

475
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:10,190
It could be accidental, them both
disappearing at the same time.

476
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:13,027
All the same, it does
look a might peculiar.

477
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:16,697
Nobody in our family ever did anything
to be ashamed of, Clem Hoops.

478
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,907
Now, you just find me a couple
of good, big lobsters or get!

479
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,485
Cousin Nettie!

480
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:24,414
Julie, Julie.

481
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:29,082
Julie. Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

482
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:33,589
- I was wondering where you been.
- I been getting married, Cousin Nettie.

483
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,884
This is my husband, Billy Bigelow.

484
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:39,262
- Your husband?
- It's a fact, Nettie.

485
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,131
Look.

486
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:46,557
- It's pretty.
- Solid gold plated.

487
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:55,941
I'm pleased to know
you, Mr. Bigelow.

488
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:59,531
And I wish you both
all the happiness in the world.

489
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:02,201
I'd have said it sooner,
but it's kind of a surprise.

490
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:04,154
It takes a little getting used to.

491
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,707
Me, I never got used to it.

492
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:11,960
I just couldn't get
the hang of being married.

493
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,129
Was that Julie's fault?

494
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:17,424
I didn't say that.

495
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:20,094
But maybe it wasn't
my fault either.

496
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:23,889
There was only one
carousel in town.

497
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,888
I couldn't go back there.

498
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:29,972
- I didn't have a job.
- What did you live on?

499
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,981
Her cousin Nettie.

500
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:42,025
- To be perfectly honest with you, I tried...
- I would be if I were you.

501
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:45,661
Me, I never got used to it.

502
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:48,786
I didn't mind living
off her cousin Nettie.

503
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:53,249
It was... It was just having
nothing to do that drove me crazy.

504
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:59,884
Well, a couple of months went by.

505
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,295
Then it was June.

506
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:07,138
Everybody was getting ready for
the first clambake of the season.

507
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,103

Hello there on the Nancy B.

574
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:23,405
- Lookin' for somebody, miss?
- My husband.

575
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:26,032
They told me he was with one
of your hands, Jigger Craigin.

576
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:29,828
Could be, ma'am, but I ain't seen him.
The whole crew's gone ashore.

577
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:34,291
They was, uh, figurin'
on goin' on that clambake.

578
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:37,043
Maybe you can catch
up with them there.

579
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,336
Thank you, sir.

580
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,222
- She gone?
- Yeah.

581
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:52,427
Billy, is that true?
ls there a clambake today?

582
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:56,480
- Yeah. First one of the year.
- Yeah.

583
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,399
Why don't we go?

584
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,653
- What for?
- We'd come back rich. That's what for.

585
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,489
Rich? From a clambake?
You'd be the first one.

586
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,700
Jigger's been the first
one lots of times.

587
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:11,161
What you need is a glass of beer.
Come on, I'm buying.

588
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,956
That clambake's just
what I've been waitin' for.

589
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,584
You couldn't find him, could you?

590
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:19,294
- No.
- Hello, Julie.

591
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,088
Hello, Carrie.

592
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:36,437
Julie, is Billy working yet?

593
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:38,439
No.

594
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:48,984
Mr. Snow says a man that can't find
work these days is just bone lazy.

595
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:54,406
Billy don't know any trade. He's
only good at what he used to do.

596
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:57,415
So now he just don't do anything.

597
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,751
You know something else, Carrie?

598
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:02,629
- Last Monday, he hit her.
- Nettie.

599
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,923
- Did you hit him back?
- Oh, no.

600
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:07,634
Well, I would have. I'd leave him.

601
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:09,928
You don't understand, Carrie.

602
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:12,806
You see, he's unhappy
'cause he ain't working.

603
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:14,724
That's why he hit me Monday.

604
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:19,146
Fine reason for hitting you. Beats
his wife 'cause he ain't working.

605
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,023
Is this before the
clambake, after or what?

606
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:24,526
It's while the clambake's going on.

607
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:27,320
Now, once we're out there,
suppose me and you get in a boat

608
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:30,323
and come back in and
did whatever we had to do.

609
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,450
Then we got back.
There's your alibi.

610
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:36,079
We could just say, "We were on the
island all the time. We got lost."

611
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,832
All right. What do we have to do?

612
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,917
I mean me, what do I gotta do?

613
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:44,003
Well, first, you go up
to old sideburns and you say,

614
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:47,504
"Excuse me, sir.
Could you tell me the time?"

615
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:53,180
I say, "Excuse me, sir.
Could you tell me the time?"

616
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:54,806
Then what?

617
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:57,517
Then by that time, I got
my knife in his ribs.

618
00:48:57,518 --> 00:49:00,062
- Then you take your knife...
- Me?

619
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,106
I ain't got a knife.

620
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:05,525
Well, you can get one, can't you?

621
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:08,069
- Does he have to be killed?
- No, he don't have to be.

622
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,406
But these New Englanders are
funny. They'd rather be killed.

623
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:13,109
Well? Hmm?

624
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:16,077
I ain't gonna do it. It's dirty.

625
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:18,288
- What's dirty about it?
- Killing.

626
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:19,539
What's the matter with you?

627
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,374
We ain't gonna kill him.
We're just gonna scare him.

628
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,919
That's what the knives
are for, to scare him.

629
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,089
I ain't gonna do it, Jigger.

630
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:32,552
Of course, if you've got
all the money you want...

631
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:34,551
I ain't got a cent.

632
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,099
Money thinks I'm dead.

633
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:43,354
Julie?

634
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,982
I got some good news to tell you.

635
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,109
'Bout you and Mr. Snow?

636
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,062
(LAUGHING)

637
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:53,531
Carrie and me are bein'
cried in church on Sunday.

638
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:57,282
- Mr. Snow, you startled me!
- (CHUCKLES)

639
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:04,960
Well, this is him.

640
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,831
- Carrie told me a lot about you.
- Oh.

641
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,634
I told you a lot about
Julie, didn't I?

642
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,590
(SNOW LAUGHS)

643
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,181
Enoch's nice-lookin', ain't he?

644
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:20,475
Oh, come, Carrie.

645
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:22,678
- Steady and reliable too.
- (SNOW LAUGHS)

646
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:27,145
(CARRIE) Well, ain't you
gonna wish us good luck?

647
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,943
Course I wish you luck, Carrie.

648
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:39,911
You can kiss Enoch too,
us bein' such good friends

649
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:42,490
and me bein' right here
lookin' on at you.

650
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:50,088
(SOBS)

651
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:52,792
Why are you cryin', Mrs. Bigelow?

652
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,803
It's because she has
such a good heart.

653
00:50:57,304 --> 00:51:00,390
We thank you for your
heartfelt sympathy.

654
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:02,719
We thank you, Mrs. Bigelow.

655
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:08,941
Billy! Billy.

656
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:19,659
You know Carrie, and...
This is her intended, Mr. Snow.

657
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,828
- Mr. Snow?
- Mr. Bigelow?

658
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:22,954
(LAUGHS)

659
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:25,123
I feel like I know you.

660
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:29,086
Oh, yes. The man who
owns the herring boat.

661
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:33,214
You smell it over there, Jigger?

662
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:35,634
Nope. Wind's in the
wrong direction.

663
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:40,847
- It's a good, honest smell!
- It's a powerful, honest smell.

664
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:43,891
Carrie. You still want
me to offer him a job?

665
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:44,976
What job?

666
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:47,937
Mr. Snow here is thinkin'
of puttin' on another boat

667
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:50,732
and I was gonna ask him to offer
you a job on it, but now I...

668
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:53,026
Me? Work on a herring boat?

669
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:56,195
(SCOFFS) No, thanks.

670
00:51:56,196 --> 00:52:00,526
Enoch, come along before you lose
your temper and do something violent.

671
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:07,249
Well? Go ahead. Say it.

672
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:11,002
I insulted your friends,
stayed out all night.

673
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:14,172
I ain't workin'. I'm livin'

wanted to go to the clambake.

- He's home.

687
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:07,558
Would it be asking too much
to know where he is?

688
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:11,434

01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:27,499
You found the treasure last year,
so it's your turn to hide it now.

1013
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,542
- (CHUCKLES)
- Enoch.

1014
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:31,628
(NETTIE) And while Enoch's
hidin' the treasure,

1015
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:34,172
all the rest of you get to work
and clean up this island.

1016
01:16:34,173 --> 01:16:37,175
Can't leave it like this for
the next picnickers that come.

1017
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:38,259
Here it is, Enoch.

1018
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:42,431
Fall in and get to work, the whole kit and
caboodle of you. Burn all that rubbish.

1019

(CACKLES)

1020
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:47,435
That's a well-set-up
little piece, that Carrie.

1021
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:49,521
Look. Ain't it near
time for us to start?

1022
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:51,856
No. We'll wait till they
start the treasure hunt,

1023
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:53,733
then we'll go together like a team.

1024
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:57,028
We'll get lost together like I said.
Did you get the knife?

1025
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:59,364
- No.
- Well, go ahead and take one.

1026
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:02,200
- Somebody might see me.
- Take it so they don't see you.

1027
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:05,075
I got some sweet
business to transact.

1028

(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

1029
01:17:14,421 --> 01:17:17,420
- Miss Pipperidge!
- (GASPS) Mr. Craigin!

1030
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:19,384
No fair peekin'.

1031
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:21,678
Oh, I didn't come here
to find no treasure.

1032
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:25,099
- You didn't?
- No. I come hereto protect you.

1033
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:27,433
You did?

1034
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:29,686
What are you doin' out here alone?

1035
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:32,063
Don't you know it's dangerous?

1036
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:35,024
Suppose I was a different
type of fella.

1037
01:17:35,025 --> 01:17:37,152
You know, unprincipled?

1038
01:17:37,153 --> 01:17:39,612
A fella who'd use physical
strength to have his will.

1039
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:42,282
- There are such men, you know.
- I know, but...

1040
01:17:42,283 --> 01:17:45,285
Every girl oughta know how to defend
herself against brutes like that.

1041
01:17:45,286 --> 01:17:47,829
Now there are certain holds
in wrestlin' I could teach you.

flat on his face in two minutes.

- (CHUCKLES) I ain't strong enough.
- Oh, it don't take strength.

1044
01:17:53,752 --> 01:17:55,503
It's just a matter of balance.

1045
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:58,378
A twist of the wrist,
a dig with the elbow.

1046
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:00,800
Here, let me show you a simple one.

Now, I'll just stand here
and you get a hold of...

Uh, no. No. Wait a minute.

I'll do it to you first,
and then you can do it to me.

- I'm just crazy for you.

Why, just to see your lovely smile,

1075
01:19:32,685 --> 01:19:35,728
I'd swim through beer
with my mouth closed.

1076
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:37,055
Oh!

01:19:39,191 --> 01:19:41,314
Oh. Hello, Enoch.

01:19:45,072 --> 01:19:46,615
Where's the fire?

1080
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:53,037
He... He was just showin'
me how to defend myself.

1081
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:55,415
It didn't look like you'd learned
very much by the time I came.

1082
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:57,542
That's 'cause you came too early.

1083
01:19:57,543 --> 01:20:00,920
In my opinion, sir, you are
as scurvy a hunk of scum

water's edge at low tide.

fuzzlin' and wuzzlin' about?

the woman I'm engaged to

woods like a fallen deer.

Oh, no, Enoch. He wasn't
carryin' me out of the woods.

Yeah, I wanted to
break Jigger's head.

1345
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:14,114
As a matter of fact,
it's still a good idea.

1346
01:39:14,115 --> 01:39:17,114
You won't find Jigger
down there anymore.

1347
01:39:18,411 --> 01:39:20,704
- You mean he's here?
- No, no.

1348
01:39:20,705 --> 01:39:23,033
He didn't even get this far.

1349
01:39:25,126 --> 01:39:27,711
Hey, tell me. What do
you got him doing?

1350
01:39:27,712 --> 01:39:30,088
That's not your concern.

1351
01:39:30,089 --> 01:39:35,427
Bigelow, you left your wife
havin' a baby comin'

1352
01:39:35,428 --> 01:39:37,846
with nothing to support 'em.

1353
01:39:37,847 --> 01:39:39,765
Why'd you do that?

1354
01:39:46,272 --> 01:39:48,600
I... I couldn't get work.

1355
01:39:49,567 --> 01:39:52,736
And I... I couldn't bear to
see her... To see her...

1356
01:39:52,737 --> 01:39:55,113
You couldn't bear to see her cry.

1357
01:39:55,114 --> 01:39:57,657
Why don't you come
right out and say it?

1358
01:39:57,658 --> 01:40:00,452
Why are you afraid to
use the right words?

1359
01:40:00,453 --> 01:40:02,621
Why are you ashamed you love Julie?

1360
01:40:02,622 --> 01:40:05,749
- I ain't ashamed of anything.
- Then why did you beat her?

1361
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:07,623
I didn't beat her.

1362
01:40:08,586 --> 01:40:11,289
- I hit her.
- Why?

1363
01:40:12,089 --> 01:40:16,920
Well, we'd argue.
She'd say this. I'd say that.

1364
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:19,346
And she'd be right.

1365
01:40:19,347 --> 01:40:21,015
So I hit her.

1366
01:40:21,516 --> 01:40:23,934
Are you sorry you hit her?

1367
01:40:23,935 --> 01:40:26,263
I ain't sorry for anything.

1368
01:40:26,771 --> 01:40:29,731
Look, I told you before.
I ain't no special case.

1369
01:40:29,732 --> 01:40:32,067
If I can't go back, just say so.

1370
01:40:32,068 --> 01:40:34,402
I didn't say you can't go back.

1371
01:40:34,403 --> 01:40:36,571
No, but you didn't
say I could either.

1372
01:40:36,572 --> 01:40:39,400
You're... You're just
trying to make me sweat.

1373
01:40:39,617 --> 01:40:41,114
No, I...

1374
01:40:42,036 --> 01:40:47,618
I'm just trying to figure out what good
you could do if I let you go back.

1375
01:40:49,252 --> 01:40:53,502
You know, your
daughter's down there.

1376
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:58,214
She's unhappy. She needs help.

1377
01:41:00,137 --> 01:41:02,222
My daughter?

1378
01:41:02,223 --> 01:41:05,308
My baby... Is a girl?
My baby's a girl?

1379
01:41:05,309 --> 01:41:09,514
No, she isn't a baby anymore.
She's 15 years old.

1380
01:41:13,568 --> 01:41:15,735
And she ain't happy, huh?

1381
01:41:15,736 --> 01:41:17,445
No, she ain't, Billy. She's...

1382
01:41:17,446 --> 01:41:19,739
You know, she's a lot like you.

1383
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:22,826
That's why I think
maybe you could help her.

1384
01:41:22,827 --> 01:41:25,701
Do you... Do you wanna
take a look at her?

1385
01:41:26,497 --> 01:41:29,082
Could I... Could I
see her from here?

1386
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:31,536
Sure, you can, if you want to.

1387
01:41:34,338 --> 01:41:38,091
Nah. If she ain't happy,
I don't wanna look.

1388
01:41:38,092 --> 01:41:42,012
Well, right now, she appears
to be having a fine time.

1389
01:41:42,013 --> 01:41:45,473
Yes, sir. There she is
running along the beach there,

1390
01:41:45,474 --> 01:41:48,018
got her shoes and stockings off.

1391
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:52,223
- Like I used to do, huh?
- Yeah.

1392
01:41:53,399 --> 01:41:56,318
Don't you think you
better take a look?

1393
01:41:58,529 --> 01:42:01,699
Well, what do I have
to do to see her?

1394
01:42:02,283 --> 01:42:04,952
Just look and wait.

1395
01:42:05,828 --> 01:42:08,872
And the power to see
her will come to you.

1396
01:42:21,594 --> 01:42:23,553
Is that her?

1397
01:42:23,554 --> 01:42:25,472
Pretty, ain't she?

1398
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:31,012
My little girl, huh?

1399
01:42:33,773 --> 01:42:35,646
Let's go, Billy.

1400
01:42:38,444 --> 01:42:40,317
All right, Billy.

1401
01:43:49,682 --> 01:43:53,011
- Look, can she see me?
- Only if you want her to.

1402
01:46:17,955 --> 01:46:20,957
My father bought me
my pretty dress.

1403
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:24,419
My father would've bought me
a pretty dress, too.

- Sure.

tell you about him?

lot of fairy stories,

fella around here.

And he was handsome?

Do you know anything else
good about him?

He used to tell funny jokes at the
carousel. And he made people laugh.

01:59:58,608 --> 02:00:00,609
You go away. You scare me.

1509
02:00:00,610 --> 02:00:04,690
Don't send me away, dear, I... I
just wanna give you a present.

1510
02:00:05,073 --> 02:00:08,493
Something pretty.
Something wonderful.

1511
02:00:10,161 --> 02:00:11,328
Psst.

1512
02:00:11,329 --> 02:00:12,906
What's that?

1513
02:00:14,499 --> 02:00:16,042
A star.

1514
02:00:17,794 --> 02:00:21,296
- Go away.
- Please, darling. I just want to help you.

1515
02:00:21,297 --> 02:00:23,549
Don't call me darling.
Let go of my hand.

1516
02:00:23,550 --> 02:00:25,634
Please, dear.
I just want to make you happy.

1517
02:00:25,635 --> 02:00:27,136
- Take it.
- No.

1518
02:00:27,137 --> 02:00:28,303
- Please.
- No.

1519
02:00:28,304 --> 02:00:30,177
- Please, dear.
- No!

1520
02:00:30,807 --> 02:00:33,510
Mother! Mother!

1521
02:00:34,018 --> 02:00:37,020
Failure. You struck
out blind again.

1522
02:00:37,021 --> 02:00:40,524
All you ever do to get out of a
difficulty is hit someone you love.

1523
02:00:40,525 --> 02:00:42,776
- Failure.
- Where is he?

1524
02:00:42,777 --> 02:00:45,362
- I don't want her to see me.
- Then she don't.

1525
02:00:45,363 --> 02:00:48,567
She looked like she saw
me before I said that.

1526
02:00:53,997 --> 02:00:55,870
Oh, he's gone.

1527
02:00:56,666 --> 02:00:58,333
I didn't make it up,
Mother. Honest.

1528
02:00:58,334 --> 02:01:01,879
There was a strange man
here, and he hit me hard.

1529
02:01:03,089 --> 02:01:05,591
I heard the sound of it, Mother.

1530
02:01:05,592 --> 02:01:09,387
But it didn't hurt. It
didn't hurt at all.

1531
02:01:10,805 --> 02:01:13,053
It was just as if
he kissed my hand.

1532
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:16,678
Go into the house, Louise.

1533
02:01:18,354 --> 02:01:21,648
What's happened, Mother?
Don't you believe me?

1534
02:01:21,649 --> 02:01:23,351
I believe you.

1535
02:01:24,360 --> 02:01:27,860
Then why don't you tell me
why you're acting so funny?

1536
02:01:28,948 --> 02:01:31,033
Oh, it's nothing, darling.

1537
02:01:31,034 --> 02:01:35,537
But is it possible, Mother? For
someone to hit you hard like that,

1538
02:01:35,538 --> 02:01:37,411
real loud and hard,

1539
02:01:38,333 --> 02:01:40,501
and not hurt you at all?

1540
02:01:40,835 --> 02:01:43,037
It is possible, dear,

1541
02:01:43,838 --> 02:01:47,463
for someone to hit
you, hit you hard,

1542
02:01:48,718 --> 02:01:50,761
and it not hurt at all.

1543
02:02:04,734 --> 02:02:05,901
Julie.

1544
02:02:16,913 --> 02:02:18,535

Julie would always know.

1558
02:03:59,557 --> 02:04:03,011
- She never changes.
- Nope, Julie never changes.

1559
02:04:04,062 --> 02:04:06,730
But my little girl, my Louise...

1560
02:04:06,731 --> 02:04:09,650
- I gotta do something for her.
- So far, you ain't done much.

1561
02:04:09,651 --> 02:04:12,194
- I know, I know.
- Time's running out.

1562
02:04:12,195 --> 02:04:14,363
But it ain't over yet.

1563
02:04:14,364 --> 02:04:17,067
Look. I want an extension.

1564
02:04:19,535 --> 02:04:22,784

Our speaker this year
is the most popular,

1570
02:04:53,653 --> 02:04:56,405
best beloved man in our town,

1571
02:04:56,406 --> 02:04:57,949
Dr. Seldon.

1572
02:04:58,074 --> 02:05:00,197
- (APPLAUSE)
- (NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

1573
02:05:05,123 --> 02:05:07,916
He reminds me of that fella
up there, that star keeper.

1574
02:05:07,917 --> 02:05:12,170
Yep. A lot of these country doctors
and preachers remind you of him.

1575
02:05:12,171 --> 02:05:15,295
(SELDON) It's the custom
at these graduations

1576
02:05:15,633 --> 02:05:20,179
to pick out some old duck like
me to preach at the kids.

1577
02:05:22,557 --> 02:05:24,725
Well, I can't preach at you.

1578
02:05:24,726 --> 02:05:26,935
I know you all too well.

1579
02:05:26,936 --> 02:05:29,730
I brought most of
you into the world,

1580
02:05:29,731 --> 02:05:32,190
rubbed liniment on your backs,

1581
02:05:32,191 --> 02:05:34,439
poured castor oil
down your throats.

1582
02:05:36,362 --> 02:05:38,947
I only hope that now
I got you this far,

1583
02:05:38,948 --> 02:05:43,073
you'll turn out to be worth all
the trouble I took with you.

1584
02:05:44,454 --> 02:05:46,076
I...

1585
02:05:46,956 --> 02:05:51,206
I can't tell you any
sure way to happiness.

1586
02:05:51,627 --> 02:05:56,503
I only know that you've gotta go
out and find it for yourselves.

1587
02:05:57,633 --> 02:06:00,302
You can't lean on
the success of your parents.

1588
02:06:00,803 --> 02:06:02,721
That's their success.

1589
02:06:03,264 --> 02:06:07,809
- And don't be held back by their failures.
- Listen to him. Believe him.

1590
02:06:07,810 --> 02:06:11,354
It makes no difference
what they did or didn't do.

1591
02:06:11,355 --> 02:06:14,229
You just stand on
your own two feet.

1592
02:06:15,693 --> 02:06:21,525
The world belongs to you
as much as to the next fella.

1593
02:06:21,699 --> 02:06:23,697
So don't give it up.

1594
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:27,990
And try not to be scared
of people not liking you.

1595
02:06:28,498 --> 02:06:30,996
Just you try liking them.

1596
02:06:31,918 --> 02:06:36,043
And just keep your
faith and your courage

1597
02:06:36,839 --> 02:06:39,383
and you'll turn out all right.

1598
02:06:40,259 --> 02:06:44,054
It's like what we used to sing every
morning when I was a boy at school.

1599
02:06:44,055 --> 02:06:46,257
Maybe you still sing it.
