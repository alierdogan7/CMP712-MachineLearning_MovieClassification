all about the ball we're having.

Oh, hello, Father.
Where have you been?

346
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,669
<i>I was looking forward</i>
<i>to seeing you again.</i>

347
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,996
Daddy. Pop.

348
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,796
You look very warm.
Your whole head is all perspired.

349
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,877
Where were you?

350
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,834
Oh, yes, it is very hot
down there, isn't it?

351
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:36,238
I'm glad to see you again,
Father, Papa, Dad.

352
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,317
What?

353
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,192
Me? I am?

354
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,197
Rich?

355
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,711
With millions? You mean,
I'll be a wealthy millionaire?

356
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,438
A rich wealthy.
A wealthy rich millions.

357
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,677
Millions, and I have
millions and millions?

358
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:00,192
That's rich to be.
Millions and millions rich is good.

359
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,358
And with all of that money,
then I can buy

360
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:08,714
my lovely precious stepmother
a warm sweater with sequins on it.

361
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:15,273
What? You want to show me
where the money is hidden?

362
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,392
You want me to go with you to see?

363
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,272
Oh, all right.

364
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,999
I want to see where all of that
millions of rich dollars are.

365
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,949
I'll go with you, Father, because I want
to see all... all the wealthy money.

366
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,038
That's rich dollars.

367
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,471
To have millions of... What?

368
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,359
You want me to go...?
Oh, out the window.

369
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,633
Oh, is that...? Is that where
all the moneys are, Father?

370
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:55,356
Oh. Well, then,
I'll just go and look.

371
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,230
Oh, all right, I will close...

372
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,908
- Argh!
- (CRASH)

373
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,519
What, Daddy?

374
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,119
Two?

375
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,837
Oh, all right.

376
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,916
(SIRENS)

377
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,833
This is Del Moore
with the NBC mobile unit

378
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,397
in exclusive Bel Air, Los Angeles,
in front of the famous Kingston estate,

379
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,833
awaiting the arrival
of Princess Charming of Morovia.

380
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,669
The princess, as you know from
the newsreels and newspaper photos,

381
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,758
is one of the most beautiful
European royals.

382
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,509
She will be in our city as the guest
of Mrs Roland Kingston,

383
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,553
whose great-grandfather,
the Duke Vladimir,

384
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:59,276
was related to the Archduke Maximilian
Rupert Lupin of Morovia.

385
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:03,314
She'll be here for a week
before starting her tour in the US.

386
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:11,878
Here she comes, with entourage,
from the airport with the escort.

387
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:17,234
For the ladies watching, she's wearing
the national colour of periwinkle blue.

388
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,318
A blue-grey periwinkle, actually,
the national colour...

389
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,796
Wowie.

390
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,594
Is she beautiful!

391
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,995
Indeed she is, my boy.

392
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,832
Hello, Fella.

393
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,430
Hello, mister.
Did you see the Princess Charming?

394
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,679
Yes. And as you said,
she's beautiful.

395
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,429
Yeah, huh?
Gee, I'd like to see her up close.

396
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,916
But I can't.
They got me locked in here.

397
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,554
They don't want her to know
I'm in the family.

398
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,077
- Oh, you'll see her.
- No, not a chance.

399
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,990
They hired a whole staff of help
to do the work that I do.

400
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,509
And they locked me in this...

401
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,472
They locked...

402
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,199
How did you get in here?

403
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,834
I'm a people. I can get in anywhere.

404
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,077
Really? Like magic,
you just pop on and pop off?

405
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,430
Just like an electric light bulb.

406
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,631
I was talking to Thomas Edison
about that.

407
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,239
Really?

408
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,396
Thomas Edison? Oh.

409
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:06,435
Well, I'm very glad to see you,
although I don't know who you are.

410
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,872
Oh, yeah. You're with the FBI,
and you're incognito.

411
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,150
You're here to protect the princess.

412
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,793
- No.
- No?

413
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,549
I can't lie to you, Fella.
I'm not from the FBI.

414
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,638
I am your godfather.

415
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,910
Your fairy godfather.

416
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,832
Godfather?

417
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,112
Fairy godfather?
Like in a fairy tale?

418
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,872
No, you're from the FBI.

419
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,878
Are you guys playing games
or something?

420
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,991
This is no game, Fella.

421
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:48,591
I am exactly like
Cinderella's fairy godmother.

422
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:56,114
As a matter of fact,
I personally handled Cindy's case.

423
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,834
You handled her case.
Why don't you sit down?

424
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:03,716
- I think you'll feel much better.
- Perhaps you better sit down.

425
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,433
I... I should?

426
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:09,189
You mean, you would rather
have me sit down?

427
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,278
I hope this doesn't sound
like braggadocio,

428
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,678
because really I'm a very modest
fairy godfather.

429
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,836
Oh.

430
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,600
But it wasn't a godmother
that Cinderella had.

431
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,711
No?

432
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,675
It was me.

433
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,279
It was you.

434
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,597
- It was me.
- Yes.

435
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:36,078
You see, the women reporters
of that period wrote the story.

436
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,795
So naturally, they attributed
my magic to a woman.

437
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,310
Women are strange, Fella.
They're like the Russians.

438
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,954
They want credit
for inventing everything.

439
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:53,276
Well, I... l... I like you.

440
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,596
I like you very much.

441
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,236
And... Except that, I just... well...

442
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,715
I don't believe in fairy tales, you see.

443
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,151
Like Cinderella and...
I just don't believe in them.

444
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:09,035
Oh, well, you have just voiced
a perfectly normal reaction.

445
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,915
But you have to believe,
or we won't be able to work together.

446
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:16,430
Well, I... Work together?

447
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,633
Godfather, Cinderella.
What are you trying to say?

448
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:24,594
Hate to be corny, boy,
but you force me.

449
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,797
Cindy!

450
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,513
Cindy!

451
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,358
Good day to you, Godfather.

452
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,471
- Now do you believe me?
- No. It's a trick.

453
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:58,229
Like on TV. With those magicians
that saw the women in half.

454
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,908
Oh, no, no, she's real.

455
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:05,511
- You can touch her.
- She's real? Touch her?

456
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:09,429
I could walk right through her.
This is a trick. She's a mirage.

457
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,596
I've seen...

458
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,473
If I weren't a married woman...

459
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,114
- (PLAYFUL GROWL)
- (SCARED GROWL)

460
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,719
Oh, she's real. Yeah, I mean...

461
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,194
Oh, I'm sorry.

462
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,279
You're married to the Prince Charming.
Mrs Charming, I'm glad to...

463
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,268
Cinderella, Mrs Charming. I mean...

464
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:35,155
- Oh, oh, oh...
- You believe now, eh, Fella?

465
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,555
No! I know the story of Cinderella.

466
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,354
She didn't wear shoes,
she wore glass slippers.

467
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:45,076
Oh, you're right.
But that was with her ball gown.

468
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,391
Real glass?

469
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:10,116
Unbreakable, sire.
Early laminated windshield glass.

470
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:14,150
I'd better go now, Godfather.
The Prince is waiting.

471
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,920
It was so nice to see you again.

472
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,396
So nice to see you again, Godfather.

473
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,989
Delighted to have met you, sire.

474
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:27,273
Oh, also very good to meet up you.

475
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:31,393
And you'll love living in a castle.
Castles are so roomy.

476
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,876
So much more comfortable
than tract houses.

477
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,672
Yeah, that's true,
some houses are not the same as...

478
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,393
Miss Person? Lady?

479
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,716
Goodbye, Cinderella.

480
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,119
I mean, Mrs Charming.

481
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,072
Goodbye.

482
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,588
Me, in a castle? What did she mean,
I would live in a castle?

483
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,917
Fella, you do believe that
I'm your fairy godfather?

484
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,872
Yes, sire. Yes, sir, I do.

485
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:05,595
- Then you'll believe what I tell you?
- Yes, without a doubt.

486
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,074
Good.

487
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:15,356
Fella, you have been chosen
to rectify all the great wrongs

488
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,074
brought about by the original
Cinderella story.

489
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:22,990
Through the centuries, women,
influenced by Cinderella, have waited

490
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,430
for their Prince Charmings
to come galloping

491
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,995
out of the wild blue yonder
on white horses

492
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,158
to claim their hands in marriage.

493
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,157
Yeah, I... I read that once.

494
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:36,193
But there was only
one Prince Charming.

495
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,076
When he didn't appear, these women
married the closest available man.

496
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,396
They were forever after miserable,

497
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,639
because they always regretted it,
and they felt that...

498
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:50,274
...that they had taken second best.

499
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,790
But what is worse, they made
their poor husbands miserable

500
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,197
because the poor fellow
wasn't a prince.

501
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,796
Oh, the Cinderella legend

502
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,709
has brought nothing but dissatisfaction
to the hearts of women,

503
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,354
and their husbands
have taken the brunt of it.

504
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:11,794
- It's not fair.
- I won't bother you with statistics.

505
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,993
But the unhappy husbands
of the world are crying for help.

506
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,589
They're crying for a chance
to get even.

507
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,196
It's time for a change.

508
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:26,310
And you have been chosen
to bring out that change.

509
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,436
Change? Out? Chosen me?
I'm...? Who chosen?

510
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,074
You've been chosen
by the head man.

511
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,874
- The head man?
- The head man.

512
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:39,675
The chairman of the board
of directors of all fairy godfathers.

513
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:43,919
And the Society for the Prevention

516

Why, we argued like a summit.

517
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,996
- There were some against you.
- What did I do to them?

518
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:04,273
They thought the one chosen should
be tall, handsome and clever.

519

But I fought for you.

I said you were perfect for the task,
because you're ordinary.

You're not tall or handsome,
and you're anything but clever.

their wives in the face -

529
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:43,398

and put them in their place.

"Why wasn't I lucky like Fella?

he's not tall, he's not clever,

happy with each other as they are.

to get this grey hair.

680
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:58,554
And, well, I don't like a phoney...

681
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:04,108
...and I don't think
you should be stuck with one.

682
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:07,790
I don't understand,
but I'm sure we'll get along.

683
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,992
- Well, I... I think that...
- (CLOCK CHIMES)

684
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:14,237
I think I'll have to get along.
That's my cue.

685
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:16,749
What do you mean, your cue?

686
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:20,839
What I'm trying to say is
the fish will turn into the car,

687
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:24,350
the car that was the chauffeur's,
the fish that was my bike.

688
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:27,120
- What?
- I can't explain.

689
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:33,156
But thank you for the dance.
I'll never forget it. I'll never forget you.

690
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:38,992
Come back.
Oh, please come back.

You're nobody at all

01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:00,598
Get home before midnight,
or my car turns into a bike

698
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,836
and you'll be a fish out of water.

699
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:06,191
You won't be able to breathe,
and I'll have a fishy bike.

01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,995
The change has started.

701
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:13,072
Wait a minute.

702
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:20,274
Watch it. Don't waste the water.
You need all you can get.

703
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:25,992
It's happening! Here, fish. Rest.

704
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:28,514
Don't worry.

Keep breathing.
Keep breathing, fish.

707
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:00,510
That's it. Breathe deep.

708
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,877
Where's your...?

709
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:14,632
- Your little red jacket?
- What red jacket?

710
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:18,753
You know which one I mean.
Where's the little red coat?

711
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:21,315
- What?
- If you have red coat,

712
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:25,069
it means that you have
a little bit of money.

713
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,713
- Money?
- Millions.

714
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,273
What money?

715
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,994
Come on. Let's have a little money.

716
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:35,512
Max, all you ever talk about is...
I don't know what you're talking about.

717
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:38,678
I'm gonna give you three seconds

718
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:43,670
to tell me where the money is,
before I bop you on your bopper.

719
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:47,589
Max, that's real important
to you, money?

720
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:51,588
That's all you really care about.
Well, I know where the money is.

721
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:54,712
I always knew where the money is.

722
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:58,993
If you really want the money,
you're gonna get it, Maxie.

723
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:27,275
You don't have to leave the house.

724
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:32,228
You can stay now.
You can afford it.

725
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,870
But the money is yours.
Your father left it for you.

726
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:43,151
Yes, but you've always loved money.
Your boys have always loved money.

727
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:46,397
And you've put up with me
all these years hoping to get it.

728
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:50,957
Well, here it is.
I hope you'll all be very happy.

729
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:55,119
And now you don't have
to put up with me any longer.

730
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:03,399
Fella.

731
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,157
I'm sorry.

732
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:17,359
Leave that alone. It's Fella's.

733
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:40,670
Hello, Fella.

734
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,279
Hello...

735
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:48,830
How'd you know my name?
Have we met before?

736
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,195
I think so.

737
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:55,073
But that's not important
at the moment.

738
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:02,079
You see, I'm working
my way through college.

739
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:04,555
I'm selling shoes.

740
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,114
I have a sample right here.

741
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:15,318
Would you be interested
in a shoe like this?

742
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:23,075
Please try it on.

743
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:27,677
I'm sure it would fit you perfectly.

744
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:32,828
No. I think that would be
just a little too big for me.

745
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:37,719
Well, good luck.
I have to be getting along.

746
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:49,392

01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:53,634
...I love you.

748
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:01,196
You can't love me.

749
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:05,234
But I do. Please listen to me.

750
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:09,194
It's no good.
You're a person and I'm a people.

751
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:12,790
- I'm a girl.
- You're a princess.

752
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,390
Well, isn't a princess a girl?

753
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:19,592
Well, then I'm...
I'm just an ordinary fella.

754

Well, I'm just an ordinary
girl princess.

01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:28,599
- You certainly don't look ordinary.
- But I can.

756
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:32,190
It's just like you said, Fella.
Don't let the clothes fool you.

757
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,356
Oh, it's more than that.

758
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,551
- It's no good.
- No, Fella.

759
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,830
Like you said, it's just the clothes.

760
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:42,635
It's no good. I'm a people
and you're a person.

761
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:45,195
It just won't mix, that's all.

762
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:48,437
Fella, please listen to me. Fella.

763
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:52,076
Fella, please look at me. Please.

764
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:54,840
Just, please.
