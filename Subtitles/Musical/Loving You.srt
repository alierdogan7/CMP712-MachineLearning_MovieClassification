Showbox / Mediaplex, Inc. presents

2
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,565
A Popcorn Film Production

3
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:42,867
Kwon Sang-woo

4
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,370
Yoo Ji-tae

5
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:49,839
Son Byung-ho

6
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:56,854
Executive Producer Kim Woo-taek

7
00:00:57,591 --> 00:01:00,151
Jeong Tae-sung

8
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:08,266
Producer Han Sung-goo

9
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:17,368
Running Wild

10
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:30,944
Move!

11
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:53,068
Come on! Son of a bitch!

12
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,847
Fucking asshole!

13
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:12,054
Director Kim Sung-su

14
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:18,458
The direct cause of death is
a fractured forehead.

15
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,457
It's not a suicide.

16
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:24,368
You sent us the dental record of
a missing person 3 years ago.

17
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:25,869
It's a match.

18
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:33,971
It's PARK, the boss of
the Dokang Family.

19
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:39,149
After he went missing, CHO
his right arm, took over the Family.

20
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:43,354
The motive must be a power game.

21
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,859
You're already on a case?

22
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,256
You haven't changed.

23
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:53,061
I gotta hand it to you.

24
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,067
You know what I nicknamed him?

25
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,364
Mr. Urologist'

26
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:03,071
He lays his hand on a case
it gets bigger and bigger.

27
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:09,644
This case has been closed
due to lack of evidence.

28
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:11,646
You sure?

29
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:14,852
We have a case.

30
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,249
Why didn't you make a baby
while staying down there?

31
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:22,953
Prosecutor OH Jin-woo

32
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,757
Boxes of documents!

33
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:27,366
Is he after all the thugs
in Korea, or what?

34
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,469
Is it lopsided?

35
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:33,164
Everybody says he's a tight ass.

36
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:34,672
Is he?

37
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:39,575
Gangsters used to shiver
at the mention of his name.

38
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:45,346
3 years ago, he busted YOO
the Kingpin...

39
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,648
...when he was green.

40
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,952
But during the interrogation...

41
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:56,654
...names of those up there
were mentioned.

42
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:02,764
So he ended up getting transferred
to the boondocks.

43
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:25,749
How are PARK's wife and kids?

44
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:29,954
I've been looking after them.
Don't worry.

45
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:32,463
Thanks.

46
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,867
Welcome back, Boss!

47
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,479
It's not a good sight.
Move them.

48
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:49,446
I'm sorry, sir.
I meant to make this quiet.

49
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:54,149
Come on, move!

50
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:10,668
So many thugs here!

51
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:13,573
On a field trip to the joint?

52
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,265
Who the fuck are you?

53
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:18,573
A homicide detective, asshole.

54
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:22,345
What are you, the Mob?

55
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,147
Shooting the Godfather?

56
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,252
Going to jail is no freaking medal.

57
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,949
- Watch it, asshole!
- CHO!

58
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,463
So you're a detective?

59
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,361
We don't want any trouble.

60
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:42,462
You have my apology.

61
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:46,773
Come on, let's go.

62
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,165
They were out of tofu.

63
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:16,562
That's made from beans, too.

64
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,871
Let's get you a suit first.

65
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,075
You'd been working in Japan.

66
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,538
Tell Mom that.

67
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,556
Mom?

68
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,571
What's going on?

69
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:56,974
What's this?

70
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,575
What's wrong with Mom?

71
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,153
I'm sorry.

72
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:14,658
I'm sorry, Mom.

73
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:17,363
It's okay.

74
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,963
I'm sorry, Mom.

75
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,771
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

76
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,462
Hang out with those punks again
and I'll kill you.

77
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:01,472
Putting me back in jail?

78
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,877
I'm not a fool.

79
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:09,039
I know you ratted on me then.

80
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:13,144
But I never held a grudge.

81
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,846
I knew you didn't do it
to screw your half brother.

82
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:20,457
You did it for my sake.

83
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:22,661
Okay then.

84
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,362
My old man and yours...

85
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,761
They gave Mom hell
while they were alive.

86
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,163
And you're gonna let her die
like that?

87
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:35,973
I can't.

88
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:42,445
Damn, you've grown up.

89
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:46,544
Yeah, I'm incapable.

90
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:53,858
I wanted to be happy, too
like everybody else.

91
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,361
Eating out on the weekends...

92
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:06,368
Three of us playing cards
on holidays...

93
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,377
You know I tried.

94
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:17,647
- It didn't work.
- We gotta save her.

95
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:21,949
You watch me.

96
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,855
I won't let her die.

97
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,679
You think I'm complaining?

98
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,441
Maybe I should.

99
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:52,551
You never think of anything
but your job.

100
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:55,052
I'm working on a big case.

101
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,252
I can't afford to mess it up.

102
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:05,158
When it's over
we'll go on a trip or something.

103
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:06,458
You know what?

104
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,159
I'm asking for a divorce!

105
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:15,172
You're married to your job
anyway, not me.

106
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:19,972
- It won't do anything for us!
- For me, it will.

107
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:23,241
Let's get it over with ASAP.

108
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,577
- You show him the contract?
- He won't sign it.

109
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,546
Is that so?

110
00:11:56,683 --> 00:12:00,244
Look, YOO.
You don't scare me.

111
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:04,657
This is no negotiation.

112
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,451
What are you doing?

113
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,775
Well, Min?

114
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,269
I don't want it!

115
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,967
You're asking for it, man.

116
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:55,570
Bro! No, Detective!

117
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,074
I'm freaking sorry.

118
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:01,840
Bro.

119
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:07,945
You even get drunk from coke
for God's sake.

120
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,858
I could've pulled it off, but...

121
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,258
- Sober the hell up!
- For mom's surgery!

122
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,263
I could've gotten the money.

123
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,861
I thought I got it.

124
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:30,568
She needs surgery to live
but we're broke!

125
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,871
I never do anything right!

126
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,673
Asshole!

127
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:42,152
Look, shut your hole.
Stay put here.

128
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:53,962
- How much?
- Hold on.

129
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:10,246
Lotto... Damn lotto.

130
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,847
8...

131
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:20,957
Sir!

132
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,671
Dong-jik?

133
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:14,978
Wake up.

134
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,949
Wake up, asshole!

135
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:22,147
Ambulance...
We need an ambulance.

136
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,557
Call 911!

137
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:46,066
We're from the Prosecutor's Office.

138
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:47,570
Please be cooperative in the scene.

139
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:04,956
Where's Dong-jik?

140
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,750
He left on business.

141
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,858
What business?

142
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,166
Gone abroad again?

143
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,568
Don't worry about him.

144
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,176
Worry about yourself.

145
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:26,779
He's still a kid.

146
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:32,546
Look after him.

147
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,153
Mom.

148
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:46,154
Have you ever been happy
in your life?

149
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:49,762
I don't know.

150
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:53,865
Never?

151
00:17:55,908 --> 00:18:01,175
What about before you got hitched?

152
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:14,357
You're so pitiful.

153
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:18,059
To me, you are.

154
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,965
We both are.

155
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,066
Aren't we?

156
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:34,075
You and I are both pathetic.

157
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:42,954
Let's go.

158
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,560
Let's go.

159
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:58,764
Black Grandeur with Seoul plates
ending in 84.

160
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:00,160
This is it.

161
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,874
Forget it.
I can print it out for you.

162
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,148
Can you pull out a list
of lefty criminals using knives?

163
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:19,342
Someone stole your money?

164
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:21,350
This so isn't you, man.

165
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:25,548
- Can you, or not?
- No need to yell, man.

166
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:26,953
Wait.

167
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:40,872
Black Grandeur LEE Dong-hyuk

168
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,245
Right.

169
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,747
I called her yesterday.

170
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:05,557
One who bought the car from you...

171
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,466
It's him, isn't it?

172
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:14,867
Maybe, or maybe not.

173
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,668
Asshole!

174
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:24,042
Yes, that's him!
That's the guy.

175
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:28,349
- Don't waste my time.
- Okay, I won't.

176
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,449
He's a lefty, isn't he?

177
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:34,047
If he jerks off with a left hand!

178
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:36,252
How should I know?

179
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:39,360
- Sir.
- You...

180
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,579
- Call him.
- Uncuff me then.

181
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:26,373
Come on, this is unnecessary.

182
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:29,242
Uncuff me.
You find it fun cuffing me?

183
00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:30,849
You're a cop, so what?

184
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:34,851
Be a cop then. Asshole!

185
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,852
If you change your words later...

186
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:41,257
You're dead.

187
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:45,258
Detective JANG?

188
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:47,961
Detective?

189
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:51,861
Uncuff me, pig!

190
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,365
Detective?

191
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,469
Where are you going?

192
00:22:57,009 --> 00:23:01,378
Son of a bitch!
I'll fucking sue you, asshole.

193
00:23:01,514 --> 00:23:04,449
Have fun taking a bus home.

194
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:21,857
A rat is approaching the target.

195
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:36,746
An informer, maybe?

196
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,957
BAE Kwang-chun!

197
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:55,558
You know why I'm here, don't you?

198
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,268
All I want is BAE.

199
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,375
So stay the fuck out.

200
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,448
Now I recognize you.

201
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:15,747
What are you doing here, Detective?

202
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:21,157
What should we do?
Should we move in?

203
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,456
- Let's.
- Come on!

204
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,665
Why'd you kill Dong-jik?

205
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:33,466
Watch it.

206
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:38,370
- The badge won't protect you.
- Get the fuck out of the way!

207
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:53,451
Cops are here!

208
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:55,853
Run!

209
00:24:58,898 --> 00:25:01,958
Stop right there, fuckers!

210
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:24,751
Let's go!

211
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:32,259
Get back here!

212
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,961
Get back here, fuckers!

213
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:53,845
Fuck!

214
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:03,953
Get up!

215
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:07,360
Don't move!

216
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:12,670
- Hold still!
- Let go, fuckers!

217
00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:24,745
Fuck!

218
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:34,350
Come on, I'll kill you all!

219
00:26:34,994 --> 00:26:36,256
Pin him down!

220
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:43,662
Sons of bitches!
I'll kill you all!

221
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:48,170
- What's this?
- He's a cop!

222
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,539
What'd you want BAE for?

223
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:57,945
Do cops need a reason
to bust thugs?

224
00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:00,748
I bust thugs when I see one.

225
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,847
We staked out here for 4 days.

226
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:08,451
We needed evidence to indict them.

227
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:11,654
And you ruined it for us.

228
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:15,360
Not everything works out
in your favor.

229
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,962
Forget about it.

230
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:19,666
Got a light?

231
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:21,966
Listen.

232
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:26,075
This isn't about arresting
one petty thug.

233
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:29,437
You want to score?

234
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:31,747
Look somewhere else.

235
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:35,947
If I was sane and reasonable...

236
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:40,252
...I would suck up to you
Mr. Prosecutor.

237
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,652
But I have a reputation
around here.

238
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:45,857
As a crazy bastard!

239
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:53,271
You listen.

240
00:27:53,706 --> 00:27:58,166
That motherfucker is mine.
You got that?

241
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:03,645
Look somewhere else
Mr. Prosecutor.

242
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:09,245
You're no different from a thug.

243
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:15,260
Fax an official request to...

244
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:21,561
Two things that I hate the most.

245
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:25,661
One is:cockroaches.

246
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:28,668
The other:thugs.

247
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:33,669
And you just called me a thug?

248
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:43,953
Who do you think you are
taking to him like...

249
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,249
- BANG.
- Yes?

250
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:50,056
You smoke, don't you?

251
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:53,358
I do, but I'll quit.

252
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:04,976
What the...

253
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:10,438
Mr. YOO Kang-jin was once known
as the President of the underworld.

254
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:16,043
Paroled recently, he says he
converted to Christianity.

255
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:19,954
Having established a facility
under his firm, Guryong Industries...

256
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:23,653
...he's committed
to helping the less fortunate.

257
00:29:29,802 --> 00:29:31,667
Did you contact Senator HONG?

258
00:29:31,804 --> 00:29:34,272
Yes, we know what he wants, sir.

259
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:38,772
Don't sir me when we're alone.

260
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:40,469
I'm okay, sir.

261
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,240
I don't feel comfortable.
We're friends from childhood.

262
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:46,143
How much does he want?

263
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,845
A lot of developers are
after that project.

264
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:51,751
To eliminate the competition
and bribe officials...

265
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,448
He's asking for Big Five.

266
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:56,959
He'll pocket half of it, though.

267
00:29:57,095 --> 00:30:00,963
We need him, after all, on this.

268
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,148
Sir! Sir...

269
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,461
Sir!

270
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:38,165
- CHO.
- Sir?

271
00:30:38,904 --> 00:30:41,065
Something's bothering me.

272
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:45,270
Prosecutor OH Jin-woo...

273
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:48,379
I think he's after you.

274
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:54,941
- He's a bad ass.
- I didn't mess up.

275
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:58,254
I've been loyal to you, sir.

276
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,255
You know that.

277
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,058
That's why I'm in a dilemma.

278
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,163
Should I kill you?

279
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,164
Or him?

280
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:15,373
Let me tell you an old saying.

281
00:31:16,008 --> 00:31:17,771
It's a golden rule.

282
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:23,443
No matter how good you are
never fight against the government. '

283
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,353
Yes. That's true.

284
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:32,251
Isn't it?

285
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:34,251
Sir!

286
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:39,759
Sir?

287
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,562
Sir!

288
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:47,267
Sir!

289
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:53,473
Let me live!

290
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:02,446
No!

291
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:17,161
Let's go.

292
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:20,766
Sir?

293
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:24,066
I know what you wanna say.

294
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:28,175
Unless they betray me,
don't desert them.

295
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:29,644
That's my principle.

296
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:34,942
When he comes to
tell him to go under till I call him.

297
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:36,247
Yes, sir.

298
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,357
What do you mean
it's out of the question?

299
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:45,156
Didn't I tell you?
CHO has gone under.

300
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,857
I just want the list of those
connected to his Family.

301
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,365
What'd you just say?

302
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:50,866
Forget it, asshole!

303
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,670
The youth hold
our profound future.

304
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,775
I'll focus on helping the needy.

305
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,373
That's a meaningful life.

306
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:05,843
From now on, I will hold charities
like this as often as possible.

307
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:10,444
But you understand that there are
people doubting your intentions.

308
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:12,955
There's nothing I can do about it.

309
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:15,958
I'm just doing what I can
to contribute to society.

310
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:18,460
- Please, comment on...
- Excuse me.

311
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:21,361
- One more question, sir.
- Excuse us.

312
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:27,162
Excuse me.

313
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:32,975
We have suspects
who might've killed your husband.

314
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:37,147
We're working on it.
We just need more time.

315
00:33:37,783 --> 00:33:43,653
I'm glad to have found his body
thanks to you.

316
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:46,154
What brings you down here?

317
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:48,058
A month ago...

318
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:53,158
A young man came to see me
right before the funeral.

319
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,362
He asked for money.

320
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:01,570
He said he had evidence
of my husband's murder.

321
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,871
- Go screw yourselves.
- Detective JANG!

322
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:08,274
Look!

323
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,449
- Lose the attitude.
- 'Lose the attitude. '

324
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:15,747
I'll quit, okay?
Fuck Internal Affairs!

325
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,856
Stop it! Cool it, will you?

326
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,753
They're suspending me!

327
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,452
He's completely out of control.

328
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:28,565
You fucking suits have no idea
what it's like out there.

329
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,760
Watch your language!
It'll be included in the report.

330
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:34,672
Include this, too!

331
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:37,065
Detective JANG!

332
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:55,759
That moron...

333
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,071
Damn it.

334
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,762
What are you doing here?

335
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:35,362
Isn't this place too humble
for you?

336
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:38,865
Cops can't beat up suspects.

337
00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:41,472
If you're here to screw me,
take a number.

338
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:45,167
Just keep in mind
that the line is quite long.

339
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:14,970
One shot is $100 Gs.

340
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:18,267
Don't you want it?

341
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,673
You need money for your mom.

342
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:24,839
What the fuck!
What the fuck is this?

343
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:27,547
You think I take bribes?

344
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:29,947
Sit.

345
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:36,454
I need a man.
One that can't be bought.

346
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,863
So what?
You want me to be your minion?

347
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:50,463
You're after BAE.
It's for LEE Dong-jik, isn't it?

348
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,378
You know he's a hit man
for the Dokang Family.

349
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:58,539
I'd be better off having you on my side
than letting you get in the way.

350
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:01,243
What I want is the Dokang Family.

351
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:06,446
We can nail both CHO and BAE
as a package.

352
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:19,565
I need a light.

353
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:21,565
Come on.

354
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:27,672
What about the suspension?

355
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:30,542
I'll have it lifted
if you join my team.

356
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:34,243
One more thing.
We go strictly by the book.

357
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:37,245
Then by my orders.

358
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,756
So you'd like to keep me
on a short leash?

359
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:46,660
- If you don't like it, forget it.
- You called me a thug.

360
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,760
What changed your mind?

361
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:53,871
You refused this.

362
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:06,350
It was too little.

363
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,344
This might do.

364
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:13,054
100 Gs? No way.

365
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:40,250
He did 25 months for assault
and blackmailing.

366
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:42,353
I know he didn't do it.

367
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:48,150
- He was a watcher.
- Was he your informant?

368
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:53,254
I just knew him.

369
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,558
I put him in jail.

370
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:01,063
He asked PARK's wife
for money.

371
00:39:02,107 --> 00:39:04,871
He must've known something.

372
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,170
That's what got him killed.

373
00:39:13,485 --> 00:39:15,146
LEE Dong-jik?

374
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,348
LEE Dong-jik...

375
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:19,957
We didn't share the cell.

376
00:39:20,492 --> 00:39:22,756
I only saw him
during exercise hours.

377
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:25,362
But I hardly knew him.

378
00:39:25,497 --> 00:39:27,465
You were in together
for a year.

379
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,463
And you two were friends
from outside.

380
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:33,070
I said I knew nothing.

381
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:36,372
- Don't fuck with us, asshole!
- Let go of him.

382
00:39:36,508 --> 00:39:38,373
Words won't do.
Fists will!

383
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,772
Let go of him!

384
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:42,739
Listen to him.

385
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:46,951
Stop shaking your legs!

386
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:54,554
He got killed
right after he was released.

387
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:58,751
Tell us whatever you know.
Little things help.

388
00:40:00,799 --> 00:40:02,164
Dong-jik...

389
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:05,861
Now thinking about it,
he had a lot of visitors.

390
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:09,869
- Visitors?
- On behalf of the cell leader.

391
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:13,466
There were so many eyes.
He was an errand boy.

392
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,476
Was the cell leader
from the Dokang Family?

393
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:16,536
No.

394
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:21,047
It was YOO Kang-jin,
the boss of the Guryong Family.

395
00:40:23,388 --> 00:40:26,448
They got released on the same day.

396
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:29,958
You didn't know?

397
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:33,862
LEE Dong-jik was a petty hand
in the Dokang Family.

398
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:36,159
He did 25 months in prison.

399
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:39,168
And he got killed by BAE
soon after the release.

400
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:40,566
The motive?

401
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:44,163
I believe he got hold of evidence
to the PARK's murder.

402
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:47,574
He blackmailed them for money
and got killed.

403
00:40:47,712 --> 00:40:49,043
You have evidence?

404
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:51,942
We're working on it.

405
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:55,143
Are you sure?
He was a petty hand.

406
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,446
Don't be mistaken.

407
00:40:56,588 --> 00:41:00,752
He was an errand boy for someone
while in jail.

408
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:07,758
YOO, the boss of the Guryong Family.

409
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:10,163
PARK was the boss of
the Dokang Family.

410
00:41:10,902 --> 00:41:13,871
As you all know
they go way back.

411
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:16,769
They were friends
when they were local punks.

412
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:19,968
However, YOO was smarter
and more decisive.

413
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:22,341
As the Guryong Family expanded...

414
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,038
...they clashed a lot.

415
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:28,141
3 years after PARK disappeared,
he was found dead.

416
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:33,450
YOO is getting himself acquainted
in the political circle.

417
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:37,254
It's either to acquire concessions,
or he has another agenda.

418
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:42,160
YOO Kang-jin is behind the murders
of PARK and LEE Dong-jik.

419
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,064
And the killer, CHO
has gone under.

420
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:48,661
- YOO gave the order.
- Look, Jin-woo.

421
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:52,970
If YOO is a major leaguer,
PARK was a minor leaguer.

422
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,945
What would he kill PARK for?

423
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,049
Whatever it was, we'll know soon.

424
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,844
He isn't what he was.

425
00:42:01,386 --> 00:42:03,547
He's a respected businessman now.

426
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:07,048
He's in the press's spotlight
for all his charity work.

427
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:10,756
Any evidence? Any witnesses?

428
00:42:11,496 --> 00:42:14,761
You don't wanna rock the boat
for nothing.

429
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,862
Jin-woo.

430
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:21,663
I know there's bad blood
between you two, but let it go.

431
00:42:21,806 --> 00:42:23,068
What do you mean?

432
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,971
You touched him 3 years ago
and got screwed.

433
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,442
- Trying to get back at him?
- What?

434
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:32,745
Locate CHO first.

435
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,251
And check out the members
of the Dokang Family.

436
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,048
We'll see about YOO.

437
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:42,949
- Sir!
- Jin-woo, one step at a time.

438
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,953
Let's make this quiet.

439
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,865
Okay, what's next?

440
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:16,359
Who could've imaged you were here?

441
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:19,454
We've been looking for you.

442
00:43:20,198 --> 00:43:21,961
You made a promise.

443
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,458
What do I know?

444
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:26,864
They give orders.

445
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,266
And I follow them.

446
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:34,176
Leave my family alone.

447
00:43:37,382 --> 00:43:40,442
As long as you're gone,
they'll be fine.

448
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:52,756
- That bastard!
- BAE Kwang-chun.

449
00:43:53,598 --> 00:43:57,261
I knew you'd show up here, asshole.

450
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:01,364
Whack him!

451
00:45:30,795 --> 00:45:32,160
Let's go!

452
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:38,466
Let go!

453
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:55,448
You can't die on me.
You can't.

454
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:02,855
I have to work hard to make up for
the 3-year-long break you gave me.

455
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:05,159
Time does fly.

456
00:46:05,296 --> 00:46:08,754
My daughter goes to middle school.

457
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,069
You don't have kids, do you?

458
00:46:15,406 --> 00:46:16,964
Let's cut the chitchat.

459
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:19,874
Get to the point.

460
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,341
You got something for me?

461
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:25,544
What is it?

462
00:46:26,584 --> 00:46:28,552
They say power lies
in the truth.

463
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:30,851
This will help you.

464
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:45,867
I know you gave an order
to kill PARK.

465
00:46:47,405 --> 00:46:51,171
Do yourself a favor
and rest well at home.

466
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:54,478
You don't have much time
left out here.

467
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:59,547
You haven't changed a bit.

468
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:03,048
You still don't know
how the world works.

469
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:06,750
No.

470
00:47:07,892 --> 00:47:09,450
It's you who hasn't changed.

471
00:47:10,795 --> 00:47:12,456
You do a lot of social work.

472
00:47:13,598 --> 00:47:15,759
But you're still a gangster.

473
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:18,661
Aren't you?

474
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:23,171
Jin-woo, if you keep pushing,
you'll get hurt.

475
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:28,845
You know I have the power.

476
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,542
You should be...

477
00:47:31,883 --> 00:47:33,544
...pretty damn powerful...

478
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:37,647
...to stop me.

479
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:40,753
You don't give up, do you?

480
00:47:46,297 --> 00:47:48,458
Sure, let's do it.

481
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:53,064
Buddhist Scriptures

482
00:48:18,696 --> 00:48:22,757
When my wife was pregnant
with her...

483
00:48:24,602 --> 00:48:29,164
...CHO told me to whack our boss
with BAE.

484
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:34,571
I had to choose
between her and our boss.

485
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,839
Surprisingly,
I didn't hesitate much.

486
00:48:40,785 --> 00:48:44,243
So I took him to a deer farm.

487
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:47,951
He wasn't suspicious.

488
00:48:48,793 --> 00:48:52,160
He liked drinking blood
from live deer.

489
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:21,051
I betrayed our boss...

490
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,659
...and gave up on one ankle
for my daughter.

491
00:49:27,098 --> 00:49:29,066
Will you protect her?

492
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:41,073
So before PARK got killed,
he and CHO clashed...

493
00:49:41,612 --> 00:49:43,546
...over Segi Shopping Mall.

494
00:49:44,782 --> 00:49:46,044
Is that right?

495
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:50,643
Our boss wanted the proceeds
to strengthen the Family.

496
00:49:50,788 --> 00:49:52,847
But CHO was against it.

497
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:57,552
- He thought it was too risky.
- Risky?

498
00:49:57,695 --> 00:50:02,655
We weren't the only Family
after that shopping mall project.

499
00:50:05,903 --> 00:50:07,165
It says here...

500
00:50:09,807 --> 00:50:12,469
llyang Development
won the project.

501
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:16,546
It was run by the Guryong Family.

502
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:21,447
The company's president is
related to YOO.

503
00:50:22,286 --> 00:50:24,345
I know that for a fact.

504
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,750
What is politics?

505
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:34,256
It's making an effort to make people
happy and satisfied.

506
00:50:34,899 --> 00:50:40,360
If I give it my heart and try hard,
they'll see how determined I am.

507
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:45,066
Have you decided on the party
and constituency?

508
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:49,646
That's still pending.
It's premature to tell you yet.

509
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,749
I might go independent
if I have to.

510
00:51:04,595 --> 00:51:08,554
What?
You're taking my constituency?

511
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:11,065
Is this how you repay me?

512
00:51:11,202 --> 00:51:14,467
I got you into the circle.
How dare you!

513
00:51:15,106 --> 00:51:17,574
I've returned your favors enough.

514
00:51:18,109 --> 00:51:22,341
I even let you get away with pocketing
half of the political funds I donated.

515
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,345
Watch it, pal.

516
00:51:24,882 --> 00:51:28,045
I've tasted all the bitter
sweets in politics.

517
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:30,847
A thug can't bring me down.

518
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,556
What'd you just say?

519
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:36,956
Go back to the damn alley
where you belong!

520
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:39,555
Politics isn't for everybody.

521
00:51:39,697 --> 00:51:41,858
Let alone thugs like you.

522
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,664
Know your damn place.

523
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:49,966
- Look, asshole.
- How dare you...

524
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,769
What's the different between
turf and constituency?

525
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:56,641
If I'm a thug, you're a worm.

526
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:01,149
Worms like you are the ones
who have fucked up the nation.

527
00:52:02,386 --> 00:52:04,547
Your constituency is mine.

528
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:07,357
Don't show up again.

529
00:52:07,892 --> 00:52:10,258
Unless you'd like to lie
down in a coffin!

530
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:17,761
The company wasn't doing well
when it took the project.

531
00:52:18,202 --> 00:52:19,362
What's its bank?

532
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:24,964
It's Prime Bank, Yeoksam branch.
Two loans, 6 and 9 million each.

533
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:28,442
Someone must've pulled strings
to grant those loans.

534
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:31,547
- Get a search warrant issued.
- Yes, sir.

535
00:52:31,682 --> 00:52:32,944
They're pros.

536
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:35,244
They must've tampered
with the books.

537
00:52:36,187 --> 00:52:37,745
- The list of shop buyers?
- Yes.

538
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:40,450
Here.

539
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:44,458
Get the dossiers on buyers
whether individuals or corporations.

540
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:47,864
Ask IRS on ownership changes
if there's been any.

541
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,465
What's this?
Aren't we gonna nail CHO?

542
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,769
Those pieces of paper won't
bring him to us.

543
00:52:57,908 --> 00:52:59,876
We're wasting time!

544
00:53:00,811 --> 00:53:04,440
We should get out there
and track down that asshole!

545
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:07,048
Come on.

546
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:10,950
This is how things are done
around here.

547
00:53:11,088 --> 00:53:15,752
We don't just go out there
and start sniffing like detectives do.

548
00:53:15,893 --> 00:53:17,656
- Okay?
- God damn it!

549
00:53:17,795 --> 00:53:19,660
What'd you say?

550
00:53:20,097 --> 00:53:23,658
That asshole always puts me down.

551
00:53:25,002 --> 00:53:27,163
He isn't cut out to be here.

552
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:48,851
Don't.

553
00:53:50,494 --> 00:53:51,859
Not sleeping?

554
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:54,257
Mom likes that song.

555
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:56,661
Leave it on.

556
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:03,363
You've lost weight.

557
00:54:04,308 --> 00:54:07,277
You shouldn't skip meals.

558
00:54:08,112 --> 00:54:10,842
The last thing I want is
you getting sick.

559
00:54:12,783 --> 00:54:14,546
You should get married soon.

560
00:54:16,887 --> 00:54:19,048
It's your mom's wish.

561
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:22,857
Marriage my ass.
That's beyond my fate.

562
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:29,657
Be nice to her while she's alive.

563
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:35,470
Once she's gone
you'll regret it.

564
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:37,871
Like I do.

565
00:54:46,183 --> 00:54:47,445
What?

566
00:54:51,088 --> 00:54:52,350
This is good.

567
00:54:56,193 --> 00:54:57,353
And...

568
00:54:59,096 --> 00:55:00,461
Thanks.

569
00:55:43,407 --> 00:55:45,671
We have a search warrant.

570
00:56:06,897 --> 00:56:08,455
Do you admit taking
illegal political funds?

571
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:10,658
How about pulling strings
for a syndicate?

572
00:56:10,801 --> 00:56:13,065
How close are you to Mr. YOO?

573
00:56:15,005 --> 00:56:17,166
You'll learn the truth soon.

574
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,941
You bought a shop at Segi Mall
in your son's name 3 years ago.

575
00:56:29,086 --> 00:56:31,953
And you sold it later
for a large capital gain.

576
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:35,458
Korea is a capitalistic nation.

577
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:39,358
You invest to make money.
Don't you?

578
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:41,361
Who gave you the investment tip?

579
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:48,062
- Wasn't it Mr. YOO?
- Well...

580
00:56:48,205 --> 00:56:50,469
That's your job to find out.
