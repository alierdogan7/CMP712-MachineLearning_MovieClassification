00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:11,968
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings. What is the problem?

2
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:13,868
Sir, I went to search
for you upstairs.

3
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:15,534
I heard that you were here.

4
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,502
Where is Vidya?
- She hasn't come, sir.

5
00:01:19,866 --> 00:01:21,901
This means I have to spend
the night with you?

6
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:24,735
No, sir. I am not so fortunate.

7
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:28,102
Sir, Vidya took time to record
a song at the radio station.

8
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:29,834
She has asked you to wait for her.

9
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:31,167
Alright, go on.

10
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:35,669
Sir. Today is your birthday.
- Yes. So what?

11
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:38,569
Congratulations, sir!
It's your big day.

12
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:43,169
So what? - Sir, it's very
cold outside. I swear!

13
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:47,901
It's cold. Take this.

14
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,168
Mr. Kumar, you have a telephone
call from Srinagar.

15
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:56,435
Hello. Who is this?
- Brother, I'm Sheila speaking!

16
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,101
Sheila baby! How are
you, sweetheart?

17
00:01:58,433 --> 00:01:59,934
Brother, I am very angry with you.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,468
Why didn't you call me?

19
00:02:01,566 --> 00:02:03,834
Only the ones who are
far away are called.

20
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,868
You are so close to me.
Why should I call you?

21
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:08,702
Alright, tell me when
you are coming here.

22
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:11,568
I will need five to six months,
Sheila. Five or six.

23
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:14,368
Listen, for assisting
you in business. .

24
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:17,669
. .I am going to search
a husband for you.

25
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:20,535
An old man?
- Not an old man. An. .

26
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:24,703
It's my sister. A husband for you.

27
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:28,868
When I come, I'll prepare
for your wedding.

28

You'll see that I will get
you married with grandeur.

00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:32,000
Will you come for the wedding?

30
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,834
Ok, brother. Bye-bye!

31
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:38,568
Mister, did you hear that?

32
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:40,868
Brother is searching
a husband for me.

33
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:45,503
He doesn't know that I have
already selected my groom.

34
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,002
I'm sorry. I had a recording
today, so I was delayed.

35
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:49,968
Come on, your fans
are waiting or you.

36
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:52,702
Yes, go in. Your fans are waiting.

37
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:54,434
I have had a habit
of waiting for you.

38
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,535
Ranvir.
- Come in. - I'll meet you later.

people who love me.

sing a new song for you.

43

What are you doing, Vidya?!

100
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,602
Something that I couldn't
do when people were around.

101
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,702
Listen to me..
- Lie down quietly.

102
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:27,035
You were born today, so you
will get a special gift.

103
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,034
Is that my gift?

104
00:08:29,233 --> 00:08:31,168
So is that all you are giving me?

105
00:08:31,366 --> 00:08:33,968
That's for now. Before
your next birthday. .

106
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:36,402
. .I am going to give
you a exquisite gift.

107
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,435
Is that gift being manufactured
in a factory right now?

108
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:41,067
You may assume that.

109
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:43,967
Your next birthday will
be celebrated. .

110
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:46,101
. .not just by two but three people.

111
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:48,067
Is someone accompanying us?

112
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,602
Who will come between us two?

113
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,101
The third person isn't an outsider.

114
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:59,970
He is your relative. The
symbol of our love.

115
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:04,970
Our child.
- Child?

116
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:10,168
I loved you, you loved me.

117
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:11,634
How did a child come between us?

118
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:15,901
When two lovers truly
Iove each other. .

119
00:09:15,966 --> 00:09:17,600
. .this is what happens.

120
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:22,636
You aren't joking, right?
You are serious.

121
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,335
Yes. I am certainly serious!

122
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:29,636
Tell me, do you want
a boy or a girl.

123
00:09:30,966 --> 00:09:33,568
My mind tells me that
it will be a boy.

124
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:36,135
You talk rubbish! Absolute nonsense!

125
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:37,633
A child and kids. .

126
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:41,902
Our youth is to have fun,
not for turning parents.

127
00:09:41,966 --> 00:09:43,367
Understood? Stop this rubbish.

128
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:55,606
Are you saying this? You!

129
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:03,105
This means whatever has happened. .

130
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,403
I am pregnant with your child. .

131
00:10:09,466 --> 00:10:11,367
You have many lovers Vidya.

132
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:15,402
The gift that they have given you,
you are calling it mine. .

133
00:10:18,466 --> 00:10:21,535
Why? Did the truth hurt you?

134
00:10:24,233 --> 00:10:26,268
Why are you staring at me?

135
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,534
Today is 26th of January.

136
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,602
Go and climb onto to the
Red Fort's tall walls.

137
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:35,469
Shout out that you are
pregnant with my child.

138
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:38,101
If you still don't feel satisfied. .

139
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:39,901
Radio singer, go to the
radio station and. .

140
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:42,168
. .sing songs that would defame me.

141
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:46,637
If you still don't feel calmed,
go consult a good doctor.

142
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:49,268
You wouldn't have to tell them
your child's father's name.

143
00:10:57,566 --> 00:11:01,937
Hi! That was Vidya, right?
The famous singer?

144
00:11:01,966 --> 00:11:04,034
Do you have an affair with her too?

145
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:06,968
No! Don't think about all
that. I only love you.

146
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,333
Won't you wish me?
- oh !

147
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,034
Happy birthday, Ranvir.

148
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:15,136
Vidya, when your brother was
dying, I promised him.

149
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:17,401
I said I would send you from
this house as a bride.

150
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:19,835
I didn't promise him that
you would be pregnant. .

151
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:22,502
. .without being wedded and
I would nurture him here.

152
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,834
Brother, if my child would cause. .

153
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:28,836
. .this house to lose its
dignity and you are. .

154
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:32,503
. .insulted in society,
I'll leave this house.

155
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,934
Yes! Go away!

156
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,368
I can't take over your ill-fame
and your stain over myself.

157
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:38,334
Not at all!
- What are you saying?

158
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:40,400
You say anything you wish.

159
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,035
Listen, Vidya. Your sister-in-law
is still alive.

160
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:47,568
Till I am here, no one can
remove you from this house.

161
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:50,234
Go in. I'll take care of everything.

162
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,901
Assume if you would have
a sister or a daughter. .

163
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,834
If something like this
would happen with her. .

164
00:11:58,899 --> 00:11:59,900
. .would you remove her too?

165
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,335
I would not just throw her
out, I would kill her!

166
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,136
I would have buried her
alive! Listen to me!

167
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:06,767
Is this house, everything will
be done as per my wishes.

168
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,768
Do you understand?
- I can't give Vidya's property. .

169
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:09,867
. .to a fatherless child.

170
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,969
It appears that all the
servants aren't here!

171
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:17,267
What are you doing here?

172
00:12:19,366 --> 00:12:22,836
Doctor, this..
- Mr. Kumar, please come in.

173
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:25,868
Where is Sheila, doctor?
- Please come in.

174
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,834
I think you got news
about my arrival.

175
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:33,234
I came so suddenly that. .

176
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,402
Doctor, she.. - She consumed
poison and committed suicide.

177
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,401
Suicide?
- Yes.

178
00:12:40,866 --> 00:12:43,468
She loved a boy. She was pregnant.

179
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,868
That boy cheated her and fled.

180
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,268
We found this note near the corpse.

181
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,167
She didn't commit suicide, doctor.

182
00:12:57,866 --> 00:13:01,436
She has suffered punishment
for my sins.

183
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:03,900
It's for my sins.

184
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:17,000
Sheila !

185
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:24,939
Ranvir, true lovers aren't afraid
to give up their lives.

186
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,837
She was truly in love.
My love is true too.

187
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:34,771
Ranvir, to get something we
have to lose something.

188
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:37,969
You got everything, still
you have lost it.

189
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:42,437
I lost everything but have
still got everything!

190
00:13:49,433 --> 00:13:53,069
No. No! I won't let that happen.

191
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,233
I won't let that happen.

192
00:14:04,966 --> 00:14:07,234
Its 25000, Gangu.
- Really?

193
00:14:07,933 --> 00:14:09,768
You wanted to go to Mumbai
and drive a taxi, right?

194
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,302
Yes. - This money will
fulfill your desire.

195
00:14:12,366 --> 00:14:15,202
Really? - You will take this
fool with you as well.

196
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:19,770
Sir, for this amount, I could
take all the fools in town.

197
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:23,269
I have been fortunate. It's as
though I have won a lottery.

198
00:14:23,766 --> 00:14:26,335
You are my dearest!

199
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:28,000
Do something.
- Yes.

200
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:29,133
Take him and run away quickly.

201
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,302
Sir, what do I do after that?

202
00:14:32,366 --> 00:14:33,633
You may nurture him, throw him at. .

203
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,968
. .a dirty spot or put
it on a railway line.

204
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:38,802
No sir. I won't commit a murder.

205
00:14:38,866 --> 00:14:40,367
The police here are very clever.

206
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,634
If I am caught, I'll
reveal everything. .

207
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,768
. .before being tortured. Yes!

208
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,035
Alright! Take this fool
and bring him up.

209
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:54,873
He isn't a fool, sir.
I know his father.

210
00:14:54,966 --> 00:14:56,734
You know him?
- Yes!

211
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,035
Who is he?
- It's useless, sir.

212
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:02,035
The doctor's certificate
will be proved false.

213
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,068
The police too will
be involved more.

214
00:15:05,299 --> 00:15:06,901
The one who had to go has left, sir.

215
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,300
Vidya has gone too.

216
00:15:08,566 --> 00:15:11,302
The play is over. The curtain
has been lowered.

217
00:15:11,566 --> 00:15:13,668
Now only he is remaining, sir.

218
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,636
Sir, from today he isn't a fool.

219
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:19,067
He belongs to Gangu.

220
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:25,304
I love kids a lot. I will
give him enough affection.

221
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:29,570
I'll beat him so much that
he will be hardened.

222
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,601
Ok, ok! You may leave now.

223
00:15:31,866 --> 00:15:38,072
You are too late. She has died.

224
00:15:39,633 --> 00:15:43,136
I heard that she gave
birth to a dead child.

225
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,669
Kailashrao has gone to cremate her.

226
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,269
His wife has gone to her
parents' place in Mumbai.

227
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:52,067
Give me any message
that you might have.

228
00:15:52,566 --> 00:15:53,733
I'll tell my employer.

229
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,701
Be quiet now. Shut up!

230
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:25,903
I only have liquor with me.
I don't have milk.

231
00:16:32,233 --> 00:16:34,802
I'll feed you if I get some milk.

232
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:37,002
I swear by God, I'll feed you.

233
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:43,034
Sister. Sister!

234
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,068
Give him a little milk.

235
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:47,967
Alright.

236
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:57,237
''The one who has brought you in
this world will bring you up.''

237
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,502
''He will bring you up.''

238
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,938
''The one who has brought you in
this world will bring you up.''

239
00:17:06,966 --> 00:17:11,670
''Everywhere, he will save
us from injustice.''

240
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:16,170
''For his devotees.. ''

241
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:21,504
''He is never separated
from his devotees.''

242
00:17:21,566 --> 00:17:28,806
''The one who has no one
has God's company.''

243
00:17:28,866 --> 00:17:31,068
''He has God, friends.''

244
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,934
''He has God, friends.''

245
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,801
Bless you, postman.

246
00:17:34,866 --> 00:17:38,836
Keep bringing money for me and
I'll keep drinking liquor.

247
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,067
Here.
- Salutations, sir. - Have fun.

248
00:17:42,566 --> 00:17:44,668
Kailashnath, I praise you.

249
00:17:56,566 --> 00:17:58,901
Father, I'm hungry. Give me bread.

250
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:02,002
Get lost. You always
keep asking for food.

251
00:18:02,533 --> 00:18:05,102
I don't have enough for drinks.
How will I buy food?

252
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:06,834
Get lost now!

253
00:18:07,766 --> 00:18:11,503
Go and get some food by begging.

254
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:47,102
Heera, you are better
than my father.

255
00:18:47,366 --> 00:18:48,800
You have brought bread for me.

256
00:18:52,066 --> 00:18:56,870
''When man's injustice
crosses a limit. ''

257
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,836
''When it crosses the limit.''

258
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:06,571
''When man's injustice
crosses a limit. ''

259
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:11,404
''He comes to us in some other form.''

260
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:15,770
''In innumerable forms. .''

261
00:19:16,433 --> 00:19:20,937
''In innumerable forms, he
has met us, friends.''

262
00:19:21,033 --> 00:19:23,435
''The one who doesn't have anyone. .''

263
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:28,438
''The one who has no one
has God's company.''

264
00:19:28,566 --> 00:19:30,801
''He has God, friends.''

265
00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:35,836
Munni, tell me this. How
many years was Ram exiled?

266
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:38,669
Well.. for two years.

267
00:19:39,433 --> 00:19:42,035
What? How many years did I tell you?

268
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:44,800
Four years.

269
00:19:46,366 --> 00:19:47,467
14 years.

270
00:19:48,366 --> 00:19:50,701
Come here. Come.

271
00:19:55,633 --> 00:19:58,502
How did you find out that Ram
was exiled for 14 years?

272
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,737
When you teach her, I listen
to you by hiding here.

273
00:20:02,866 --> 00:20:04,767
Oh! - Forgive me. I won't
listen to you again.

274
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,367
No! Do listen to me.

275
00:20:06,566 --> 00:20:10,603
Why do you do this work?
- For food.

276
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,035
Why? Don't you have any relative?

277
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,836
I do. A dog, my father and me.

278
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,534
Our family is restricted to three.

279
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:20,534
What is your name?
- Heera.

280
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,368
I wasn't named by my father.

281
00:20:22,433 --> 00:20:25,402
My dog's name is Heera.
So I named myself as him.

282
00:20:25,466 --> 00:20:27,334
Professor, may I tell you something?

283
00:20:27,433 --> 00:20:30,302
Yes.
- Heera knows many languages.

284
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:33,669
Really? Child, from where did
you learn these languages?

285
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,602
I work for varied people.

286
00:20:36,966 --> 00:20:39,401
They are Bengali,
Gujarati or Madrasi.

287
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:41,501
They abuse me in their language.

288
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,801
I understand them. I learnt
it in that way.

289
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:47,836
Alright, child. Read a little
when you get time.

290
00:20:48,433 --> 00:20:51,302
I do want to learn but I don't
have money to buy a book.

291
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:53,835
I'll give you a book,
Heera. Take this.

292
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,769
Take it. I'll tell my grandma
and get another book.

293
00:20:58,366 --> 00:21:00,568
Keep it, Heera. I'll
get her another.

294
00:21:01,766 --> 00:21:03,634
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

295
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:05,868
This is your salary for the month.

296
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:08,468
I swear! Madam, I have
told you many times.

297
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,735
Don't give him money.
You'll spoil him.

298
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:12,867
What are you hiding?

299
00:21:14,433 --> 00:21:17,335
Are you stealing?
- I didn't steal!

300
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,634
I gave him the book.

301
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,369
Bring the book here.
- I won't give it to you. - Come!

302
00:21:21,433 --> 00:21:23,401
Get a strong Ahmedabad tea!

303
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:26,302
Sir!
- Greetings. - Sit here.

304
00:21:27,366 --> 00:21:28,467
Do you want a Rasgulla
(Indian sweet)?

305
00:21:28,566 --> 00:21:29,800
Get a Samosa.
- Samosa (snack)?

306
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:31,968
Get a Samosa for the Bengali man.

307
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:33,367
What do you want?

308
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:36,335
A special. Quickly.
- A special! Quickly.

309
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,302
Sir, didn't you get your yoghurt?
- No, it hasn't come.

310
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:42,668
What's going on? Give
him his yoghurt.

311
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:45,602
He's getting it. He's getting it.
- A famous song.

312
00:21:45,966 --> 00:21:48,635
''You don't have any,,work
in my territory.

313
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:19,172
''You don't have any,,work
in my territory.

314
00:22:19,233 --> 00:22:22,502
Have you come here for
work or for dancing?

315
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:25,402
Is the person singing, your mother?

316
00:22:25,566 --> 00:22:26,667
I don't know that, sir.

317
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:29,635
Whenever this song comes on air,
something happens to me.

318
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,767
Something happens to you!

319
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:33,335
These plates are lying here.
Who will wash them?

320
00:22:33,766 --> 00:22:34,833
Pick them up!

321
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,635
Look, sir. I am alone now.

322
00:22:37,266 --> 00:22:38,667
Earlier I had my dog, Heera.

323
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:41,202
I would give him the plates.
He would lick and clean them.

324
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,768
Now he is dead.
- Dead?

325
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,467
Your dog used to clean the plates?

326
00:22:45,566 --> 00:22:48,702
What are you saying?
- Sir, don't hurt me.

327
00:22:48,766 --> 00:22:51,668
Otherwise I'll pick all these
plates and hit you with them.

328
00:22:51,733 --> 00:22:53,568
What rubbish!
- Leave it.

329
00:22:53,633 --> 00:22:56,402
I don't want your job. I
have seen.. - Get lost.

330
00:22:56,599 --> 00:23:00,337
Come here. Write your name.

331
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:05,233
Your father's name.

332
00:23:07,366 --> 00:23:09,201
Will I work or my father?

333
00:23:09,433 --> 00:23:10,500
Why do you want my father's name?

334
00:23:10,566 --> 00:23:13,101
You will do the work
but it is required.

335
00:23:13,133 --> 00:23:14,234
Father's name is required.

336
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:18,603
Write it.
- Tell me.

337
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:21,369
Gangu Ganpat.

338
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:23,233
Did you write that?

339
00:23:23,733 --> 00:23:25,434
Why are you talking so arrogantly?

340
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,169
I am not arrogant, it's my style.

341
00:23:28,233 --> 00:23:30,101
Really? If you want
to work here be. .

342
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:32,735
. .a little soft in your
style. Understand?

343
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:36,102
This is my cool style. If
I behave rudely with you. .

344
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,768
. .you would start shaking.
Understand?

345
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:41,335
Alright. Come on, sign here.

346
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,369
Sit here. The foreman will tell
you what is to be done.

347
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,368
Heera, wait for five minutes.

348
00:24:05,033 --> 00:24:06,401
Do you have cotton in your ears?

349
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:08,501
Didn't you hear the company's
bell just rang?

350
00:24:08,566 --> 00:24:11,135
I am a foreman. You
have to listen to me.

351
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:15,536
You may be a foreman, a
five-man or a watchman.

352
00:24:15,633 --> 00:24:18,435
Once the company's bell rings,
I don't know any man.

353
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,567
Understand?

354
00:24:21,433 --> 00:24:24,235
May God cause you to be ruined!

355
00:24:24,266 --> 00:24:27,369
Brother Gaffur. Whom
are you abusing?

356
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:29,401
Heera, what do I say?

357
00:24:29,466 --> 00:24:34,304
I asked this man 2000 rupees
for my daughter's wedding.

358
00:24:34,366 --> 00:24:37,402
As an advance. He refused to pay me.

359
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:41,203
Brother Gaffur, you don't
know how to ask.

360
00:24:42,033 --> 00:24:43,100
How to ask?

361
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:47,670
Son, when I came to this company,
I was as tall as you.

362
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:52,337
Working for 30 years, I have
shrunk to this height.

363
00:24:52,466 --> 00:24:56,536
If you work for 30 years, you
will be shorter than me.

364
00:24:56,633 --> 00:24:58,368
You teach me about ways?

365
00:24:58,533 --> 00:25:01,669
Brother Gaffur, my style
is different. Look.

366
00:25:02,633 --> 00:25:03,967
If you want clarified
butter from a tin. .

367
00:25:04,033 --> 00:25:06,535
. .you have to bend you
fingers a little.

368
00:25:07,366 --> 00:25:09,968
If you want to get money
from such a rich man. .

369
00:25:10,033 --> 00:25:12,168
. .you would have to
be a little bent.

370
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:15,269
Son, I am a poor man.
How can I cheat him?

371
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:16,600
The same old hollow dialogue!

372
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,402
That's the fault in labourers.

373
00:25:20,033 --> 00:25:24,070
We call ourselves as poor. We
believe that we are helpless.

374
00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:25,200
Then we move around.

375
00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:27,502
Rich people look at
this and exploit us.

376
00:25:28,266 --> 00:25:30,301
Brother Gaffur, wait here.

377
00:25:30,966 --> 00:25:33,201
I'll show you how to
get money from him.

378
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:35,534
No! Son, I don't like fighting.

379
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:37,635
I won't fight, brother Gaffur.

380
00:25:38,066 --> 00:25:44,105
If our work can be done through
a talk, why fight? Look.. there. .

381
00:25:44,633 --> 00:25:47,235
Tell me clearly! What
do you want to say?!

382
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,567
I'm telling you, sir.

383
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:52,535
One inspector and four
constables came here.

384
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:53,968
They saw the truck and stopped it.

385
00:25:54,033 --> 00:25:56,135
They peeped into the truck
and saw illegal goods.

386
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,901
I escaped from there.
The inspector said. .

387
00:26:01,933 --> 00:26:05,503
. .that he confiscates this
truck and the goods inside.

388
00:26:05,533 --> 00:26:06,901
You don't pay the tax and get your. .

389
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:08,534
. .goods out from the exit gate.

390
00:26:10,966 --> 00:26:14,602
Sir, you were fortunate.
I was sitting there.

391
00:26:15,233 --> 00:26:18,369
Otherwise you wouldn't be sitting
here today but in jail.

392
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,969
You mean, the police
took away our truck?

393
00:26:22,033 --> 00:26:26,170
Yes! Have I been telling you
a movie's story till now?

394
00:26:26,966 --> 00:26:28,067
When did this take place?

395
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:33,104
Sir, when the sun sets and
before it rises, its night.

396
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,235
I don't have a watch
to tell you the time.

397
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,201
This incident has taken place, sir.

398
00:26:37,533 --> 00:26:42,304
Still, I have flattered and
requested to the inspector.

399
00:26:42,466 --> 00:26:46,570
Sir, I am your employee. Why would
I have you sent to the jail?

400
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:48,368
What happened then?
- What then?

401
00:26:48,966 --> 00:26:52,169
He doesn't agree with
a few requests.

402
00:26:52,466 --> 00:26:56,570
I kept flattering him, he agreed
and we sealed the deal.

403
00:26:57,633 --> 00:26:59,167
Then he said, 5000.

404
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,470
He wants 5000 otherwise your
company will be doomed.

405
00:27:04,266 --> 00:27:08,269
Sir, he will send his
constables here.

406
00:27:08,866 --> 00:27:12,469
Give them the money
and avoid trouble.

407
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:18,138
Come here. There he is.

408
00:27:21,966 --> 00:27:24,401
Did you see that? He is the
inspector's constable.

409
00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:27,935
Go and give him the money.

410
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:30,367
What did you say your name was?

411
00:27:30,433 --> 00:27:32,334
Heera.
- Yes, Heera.

412
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:38,472
Yes, sir.
- Take 5000 and get it done.

413
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:41,968
Sir, why do you bring
me into all this?

414
00:27:42,466 --> 00:27:44,935
I haven't been arrested yet.

415
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:47,067
My name will enter the police diary.

416
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:48,200
That would be a problem, sir.

417
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,835
It will be alright. If
there is some problem. .

418
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,168
. .I am here for you. Take this.

419
00:27:54,099 --> 00:27:58,304
Sir, I like you a lot. Hence,
I'm doing all this.

420
00:27:58,466 --> 00:28:01,202
Otherwise if it were someone else,
I wouldn't even spit. .

421
00:28:01,266 --> 00:28:03,835
Sorry sir. I spat a little.

422
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:05,867
Greetings!

423
00:28:09,266 --> 00:28:12,369
May God keep you safe. 1, 2, 3..

424
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,470
Until you don't pay the earlier
debt, you won't get money.

425
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:26,906
Forget about a debt! My
Heera has come. My son!

426
00:28:28,266 --> 00:28:33,371
My dearest boy!
- What is it, father?

427
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:36,935
How did you change suddenly?

428
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,036
Do you have a little money?
I have to repay a debt.

429
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:42,900
Are you thirsty?

430
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:48,069
You are speaking sweetly
because you want liquor.

431
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:49,801
From today, you won't have liquor.

432
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,069
You don't know the value of liquor.

433
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:55,468
You idiot! You have never drunk!

434
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:59,770
Give me a little money. I'll
die if I don't get liquor.

435
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,035
Drinking liquor everyday would
cause you slow death.

436
00:29:03,099 --> 00:29:04,167
Look, father.

437
00:29:04,966 --> 00:29:09,203
From my childhood till this day,
you drank from my earnings.

438
00:29:09,766 --> 00:29:10,833
From today, you won't get. .

439
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,434
. .anything for liquor, understand?

440
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:17,304
Pay me quietly. Otherwise
I'll beat you up!

441
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:19,801
You'll hit me.
- A lot!

442
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,838
Look father. You spent your
entire life as a drunkard.

443
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:31,702
You may have forgotten that
Heera was smaller. .

444
00:29:31,766 --> 00:29:34,869
. .compared to you earlier but
is now taller than you are.

445
00:29:35,766 --> 00:29:37,434
You have hit me and made me strong.

446
00:29:38,433 --> 00:29:41,869
Now I'll hit you once
and flatten you!

447
00:29:41,933 --> 00:29:45,369
Understand?
- Go away! Are you scaring me?

448
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:47,868
I brought you up all these years.

449
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,936
Now that I am old, are you
showing me your strength?

450
00:29:51,766 --> 00:29:54,935
You idiot! After all you
are someone else's child.

451
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,935
If you were my son, you
wouldn't say this to me.

452
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:02,868
Other's child?
- That's right!

453
00:30:03,766 --> 00:30:06,401
If you were my son, would
you not give me liquor?

454
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:15,138
No, you are lying.
You are my father.

455
00:30:15,966 --> 00:30:18,068
You want to take money
from me for drinks.

456
00:30:18,133 --> 00:30:19,200
That is why you are lying.

457
00:30:19,366 --> 00:30:20,700
Tell me that you are lying.

458
00:30:20,766 --> 00:30:23,869
I swear! I don't want your money.

459
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:27,435
I thought you would
grow to support me.

460
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,336
You have become my enemy, you idiot!

461
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,204
Who are my parents, then?

462
00:30:37,266 --> 00:30:38,767
You are from the gutter!

463
00:30:39,066 --> 00:30:42,102
These people eat food and throw
Ieftovers in the gutter.

464
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:44,034
You are their leftover.

465
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:47,235
No! No!

466
00:30:48,233 --> 00:30:55,039
Which rich man's leftover
am I? Tell me.

467
00:30:56,099 --> 00:31:00,737
Who gave birth to me and left
me to live in dire straits.

468
00:31:00,766 --> 00:31:02,667
Tell me.
- I won't tell you.

469
00:31:02,933 --> 00:31:05,335
Tell me. Tell me!

470
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,068
I swear by God! I won't tell you!

471
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:13,906
Tell me or I'll kill you!
Tell me! Tell me!

472
00:31:14,233 --> 00:31:17,069
I won't tell you, you
fool! I never will.

473
00:31:18,099 --> 00:31:19,935
You didn't give me liquor.

474
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,901
I won't tell you about your father.

475
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:25,068
I'll die but I will never tell you!

476
00:31:47,966 --> 00:31:49,867
Oh Lord! What are you doing?

477
00:31:49,933 --> 00:31:51,634
Where is that paper on which my. .

478
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,168
. .father's name has been written?

479
00:31:53,233 --> 00:31:55,134
Why do you want it? For what reason?

480
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,202
Don't ask me. Just get that book.

481
00:31:58,266 --> 00:31:59,667
I'll give it. I'll give.

482
00:31:59,733 --> 00:32:03,670
Take this.

483
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,901
Here.
- Pen.

484
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,067
Pen !

485
00:32:16,566 --> 00:32:17,867
You cut your father's name?

486
00:32:18,766 --> 00:32:22,936
Not just his name. Assume
that I have killed him.

487
00:32:24,566 --> 00:32:25,867
My father is dead!

488
00:32:26,733 --> 00:32:30,303
I don't have a father!
I don't have anyone!

489
00:32:30,966 --> 00:32:33,635
I am alone. I am without anyone.

490
00:32:34,066 --> 00:32:39,004
I am an orphan! An orphan!

491
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,904
''If He so wishes. .''

492
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,938
''If he wishes to, he tests angels.''

493
00:32:59,066 --> 00:33:03,837
''He creates us, destroys us
and then creates us again.''

494
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,670
''A man breaks down. .''

495
00:33:07,733 --> 00:33:10,635
Stop it! Stop singing!

496
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,501
I have been hearing this
from my childhood. .

497
00:33:14,533 --> 00:33:16,635
. .that there is a God.
Where is your God?

498
00:33:18,633 --> 00:33:20,501
This is a lie! Everything
that has been. .

499
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:22,668
. .written in your book is a lie.

500
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,101
The truth is before you!

501
00:33:26,966 --> 00:33:31,603
Some people in this world use
us like counters in a game.

502
00:33:31,666 --> 00:33:34,568
This is the truth.
- No, son. No!

503
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:38,769
The one, who is the creator,
knows it.

504
00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:43,503
If he has hurt you today,
tomorrow he'll. .

505
00:33:43,566 --> 00:33:49,805
. .heal you in such a way that
you won't be hurt ever again.

506
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:55,770
If you don't believe in him
today, you will someday.

507
00:33:56,566 --> 00:33:57,867
You certainly will!

508
00:33:58,733 --> 00:34:03,037
Oh God! Have mercy on
this child of yours.

509
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,967
Have mercy!

510
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,904
Heera.. are you upset
about something?.

511
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:14,101
I had been hurt a long
time ago, friend.

512
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,036
Now my heart's fire is more
heated than a fire.

513
00:34:22,933 --> 00:34:25,769
Chuttan, why are you crying?

514
00:34:26,133 --> 00:34:28,602
This poor guy's father
died yesterday.

515
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,000
He's drinking since the morning.

516
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,735
Yesterday your father died
and you are still crying.

517
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,170
I have just killed my father.
Am I crying?

518
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:47,834
They don't care about the
people who are living.

519
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,534
They cry for the ones who have died.

520
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,501
Until when will you cry?

521
00:34:52,066 --> 00:34:54,468
Your father has died today.
Tomorrow your uncle will die.

522
00:34:54,633 --> 00:34:56,668
Then it will be your grandparents.

523
00:34:56,733 --> 00:34:57,834
Will you keep crying for everyone?

524
00:35:00,366 --> 00:35:03,736
I'll tell you something.

525
00:35:04,733 --> 00:35:08,570
They are all fake relations,
understand?

526
00:35:09,633 --> 00:35:13,670
They fulfill their relations for
a while then they leave us.

527
00:35:15,033 --> 00:35:18,770
Break it. Break these relations!

528
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:21,802
Live as an orphan the
way I am living.

529
00:35:23,966 --> 00:35:26,501
You son of a coffin-stealer!

530
00:35:27,366 --> 00:35:28,867
You're crying for your
father's death.

531
00:35:32,433 --> 00:35:33,734
You have spoilt my mood.

532
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:40,867
Why did you stop? Dance!

533
00:37:41,466 --> 00:37:42,733
It's because I have come, sir.

534
00:37:43,866 --> 00:37:49,371
When I come to a place,
all its doors are shut.

535
00:37:49,633 --> 00:37:52,669
Who is he?
- He asks about me!

536
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:53,900
I'll tell you, sir.

537
00:37:53,966 --> 00:37:56,868
I'll tell you, sir.
- What are you doing? What?

538
00:37:56,933 --> 00:37:58,234
Firstly, you are broke.
When a rich man. .

539
00:38:01,466 --> 00:38:04,502
Why?
- Today, I am not broke, aunt.

540
00:38:04,566 --> 00:38:06,467
Look, here. I have brought notes.

541
00:38:06,533 --> 00:38:08,301
Oh! Did you win a lottery?

542
00:38:08,366 --> 00:38:09,533
I didn't win a lottery, aunt.

543
00:38:10,233 --> 00:38:12,568
Today is a big day in my life.

544
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:15,769
I had a father who died today.
So I am very happy.

545
00:38:15,866 --> 00:38:17,867
Today, I'll dance and
make others dance too.

546
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,535
He says he'll dance and sing!

547
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,235
Yes! I'll sing and dance!

548
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,436
I want to give sorrow
to my father's soul.

549
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:29,234
You will do the same.

550
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,802
The day your father dies,
you will do the same.

551
00:38:31,866 --> 00:38:33,167
The only difference will
be that you will first. .

552
00:38:33,233 --> 00:38:35,735
. .fake crying before the public.

553
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,501
Then you'll collect
your father's money.

554
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:39,334
You'll come here secretly.

555
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,436
You will disown your father's
soul. Am I right?

556
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,602
It looks as though you are
going to be killed too.

557
00:38:45,266 --> 00:38:47,201
I was close to death many times.

558
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,468
Whenever it came, it
went back defeated.

559
00:38:49,566 --> 00:38:51,501
I have left it to the
graveyard many times.

560
00:38:51,566 --> 00:38:54,235
Heera, what are you doing?
Use your presence of mind.

561
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,502
Move back! I'll take care of him.

562
00:38:56,566 --> 00:38:57,667
Tell me, will you leave or not?

563
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:03,269
Friend, I am like the tail of a dog.

564
00:39:03,566 --> 00:39:05,834
Even if it is held straight
for 12 years. .

565
00:39:06,699 --> 00:39:08,768
Anything would happen but
I won't be straightened.

566
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:10,568
You can't straighten me!

567
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:12,501
Isn't that so?
- Look. .

568
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,203
If I use this, you're dead.

569
00:39:18,633 --> 00:39:21,435
Your relatives will weep..
your parents. .

570
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,501
I don't care, I have no one.

571
00:39:23,533 --> 00:39:25,234
No one after me or before me.

572
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,169
I don't have anyone
who would cry for me.

573
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:31,636
Hollow people like you
could die by this gun.

574
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,602
I think that its bullet
is like a peppermint.

575
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:35,733
Look at this.

576
00:39:57,233 --> 00:39:59,535
''In some way. .''

577
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,834
''Somehow or the other. .''

578
00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:08,101
''In some way. .''

579
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:10,201
''Somehow or the other. .''

580
00:40:10,266 --> 00:40:12,401
''I will spend my life.''

581
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,704
''How will you do it, dear friend?''

582
00:40:16,766 --> 00:40:20,836
''How will you do it?''

583
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:23,368
''I don't have anyone after me.''

584
00:40:25,433 --> 00:40:27,701
''None at all.''

585
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,102
''I don't have anyone after me.''

586
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:34,167
''None at all.''

587
00:40:34,233 --> 00:40:39,104
''No one to cry after I die.''
- ''Neither a man nor a woman.''

588
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:45,205
''How will you do it, dear friend?''

589
00:41:11,533 --> 00:41:16,471
''You are the young one
of a human as I am.''

590
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:19,268
''You are a prayer that
has been heard.''

591
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:23,203
''I am an unwanted favour.''

592
00:41:24,533 --> 00:41:32,574
''You are the young one
of a human as I am.''

593
00:41:33,433 --> 00:41:37,036
''You are a prayer that
has been heard.''

594
00:41:37,066 --> 00:41:41,437
''I am an unwanted favour.''

595
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:50,240
''The world takes me
to be an orphan.''

596
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:57,038
''It is a world that
has been formed. .

597
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:59,135
. .by cruel people such as you.''

598
00:41:59,366 --> 00:42:01,701
''Your abusive language. .''

599
00:42:03,699 --> 00:42:06,202
''Appears to be a blessing to me.''

600
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:10,167
''Your abusive language. .''

601
00:42:10,266 --> 00:42:12,434
''Appears to be a blessing to me.''

602
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:16,703
''If I give a blessing it
appears to be an abuse.''

603
00:42:17,033 --> 00:42:21,337
''How will you do it, dear friend?''

604
00:42:21,433 --> 00:42:25,236
''How will you do it?''

605
00:42:47,266 --> 00:42:55,307
''It is unlikely that there'll ever
be sweat on your forehead.''

606
00:42:56,033 --> 00:43:03,974
''That will be a highly improbable.''

607
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:12,507
''Your sweat is more valuable
than our blood.''

608
00:43:13,233 --> 00:43:21,541
''Our blood is deemed
to be worthless.''

609
00:43:21,633 --> 00:43:24,035
''My blood is similar to water.''

610
00:43:26,266 --> 00:43:28,401
''It won't make a difference
whether I live or die.''

611
00:43:30,466 --> 00:43:32,501
''My blood is similar to water.''

612
00:43:32,566 --> 00:43:34,634
''It won't make a difference
whether I live or die.''

613
00:43:34,966 --> 00:43:39,236
''I know about all the blows
that time may give.''

614
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:43,637
''How will you do it, dear friend?''

615
00:43:43,966 --> 00:43:47,336
''How will you do it?''

616
00:43:48,033 --> 00:43:50,135
''In some way. .''

617
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:52,335
''Somehow or the other. .''

618
00:43:52,433 --> 00:43:54,401
''In some way. .''

619
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,535
''Somehow or the other. .''

620
00:43:56,633 --> 00:43:58,901
''I will spend my life.''

621
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,170
''How will you do it, dear friend?''

622
00:44:03,233 --> 00:44:06,936
''How will you do it?''

623
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,468
''I don't have anyone after me.''

624
00:44:09,533 --> 00:44:11,902
''None at all.''

625
00:44:11,966 --> 00:44:13,934
''I don't have anyone after me.''

626
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,035
''None at all.''

627
00:44:16,099 --> 00:44:20,938
''No one to cry after I die.''
- ''Neither a man nor a woman.''

628
00:44:20,966 --> 00:44:27,038
''How will you do it, dear friend?''

629
00:44:35,933 --> 00:44:39,436
Wow! You were fantastic! Well
done, mister.. - Heera.

630
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,902
Yes, Mr. Heera. You
are a real jewel.

631
00:44:41,966 --> 00:44:43,033
Why are you here in this town?

632
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:44,568
This place doesn't suit you.

633
00:44:44,833 --> 00:44:47,068
Sir, this world doesn't
suit me either.

634
00:44:47,133 --> 00:44:48,834
I thought about leaving it but. .

635
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,969
. .I have to find some people.

636
00:44:52,433 --> 00:44:56,170
Mr. Heera, my mind tells me
you are sure to succeed.

637
00:44:56,466 --> 00:45:01,103
Sir, my mind tells me that
someday you will be dead.

638
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,834
Alright, I'm leaving.
We'll meet again.

639
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,868
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings. Come on.

640
00:45:07,833 --> 00:45:11,369
Aunt, I sang a song. Something. .

641
00:45:11,833 --> 00:45:13,167
Sir, what do we do about him?

642
00:45:13,433 --> 00:45:17,203
He is alone. We can
make him do anything.

643
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,902
Pay him some money and get
him to me immediately.

644
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,203
Darling, why are you giving
me beer and spoiling me?

645
00:45:31,766 --> 00:45:32,900
Greetings, sister-in-law.

646
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,868
Is she your sister-in-law?

647
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,035
Brother, your wife is
like my sister-in-law.

648
00:45:38,766 --> 00:45:40,334
No, Heera. She isn't my wife.

649
00:45:40,766 --> 00:45:43,034
You mean without a license..
- Yes.

650
00:45:44,066 --> 00:45:45,467
Ram.
- Yes.

651
00:45:46,433 --> 00:45:47,867
Heera, what will you drink?

652
00:45:47,966 --> 00:45:49,334
Nothing, sir. Tell me,
what do you want?

653
00:45:49,866 --> 00:45:53,836
What work can you do?
- Any work, sir.

654
00:45:54,099 --> 00:45:56,402
Anything other than what
you were doing right now.

655
00:45:57,133 --> 00:46:00,336
If I get money, I can use
my hands or a knife.

656
00:46:00,433 --> 00:46:01,901
I can even bash up a few people.

657
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,036
Very good, very good. Will you
accompany me to Kashmir?

658
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:07,769
Why just Kashmir? I am ready
to go anywhere with you.

659
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:11,102
Heera, I have a vacant
position of a manager.

660
00:46:11,433 --> 00:46:13,768
You may have a position of
a manager or a damager.

661
00:46:13,866 --> 00:46:15,167
It's alright with me, sir, only. .

662
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,301
Yes, you will get that too!

663
00:46:17,699 --> 00:46:18,867
Heera, there is one thing.

664
00:46:19,166 --> 00:46:22,869
You will have to change
your way of speaking.

665
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,768
Don't worry about my language, sir.

666
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:26,434
I look at a person
and speak accordingly.

667
00:46:26,766 --> 00:46:29,869
There is no language in India
which I can't speak easily.

668
00:46:30,033 --> 00:46:33,403
I'll give you an example.

669
00:46:36,099 --> 00:46:38,068
Greetings, sir.

670
00:46:38,133 --> 00:46:40,702
If you don't mind. .

671
00:46:40,766 --> 00:46:49,107
. .I would like to present
some poems to you.

672
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:50,233
Enough, enough!
- Sir, languages from. .

673
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,335
. .the entire India have
still to be used.

674
00:46:53,033 --> 00:46:55,702
Dear, my child.

675
00:46:55,766 --> 00:46:57,033
Can't you shut your mouth and. .

676
00:46:57,099 --> 00:46:59,702
That's enough, Heera! I understand.

677
00:46:59,766 --> 00:47:01,801
You really are a man
of importance for me.

678
00:47:02,033 --> 00:47:04,869
Heera, you will have to change
your attire as well.

679
00:47:05,133 --> 00:47:09,637
Sir, these days people may leave
their parents for money.

680
00:47:09,666 --> 00:47:11,167
It won't be difficult
to change my attire.

681
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:13,634
I'll transform to such
an extent that you'll. .

682
00:47:13,699 --> 00:47:15,234
. .find it difficult to recognise me.

683
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:17,800
One last thing.

684
00:47:18,933 --> 00:47:23,003
I need a return ticket.
- Return ticket?

685
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:27,637
Yes. This is because if I
don't like your business. .

686
00:47:27,699 --> 00:47:29,168
. .I want to return from there.

687
00:47:29,833 --> 00:47:33,269
Heera, I like that. You'll
get a return ticket too.

688
00:47:33,366 --> 00:47:37,002
Here's some money, do
something about your look.

689
00:47:42,333 --> 00:47:44,068
Bless you, my dear!

690
00:47:46,099 --> 00:47:47,734
'You look amazing! '

691
00:47:48,933 --> 00:47:51,702
'Clothes can change man
to a great extent.

692
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:54,134
A short while ago,
I was called Heera.

693
00:47:55,766 --> 00:47:59,102
'Now I really look like a jewel# 

694
00:48:02,566 --> 00:48:04,301
Brother, may I tell you something?

695
00:48:04,666 --> 00:48:07,635
Mahinder has completely changed you.

696
00:48:07,699 --> 00:48:09,201
You have been given a new look.

697
00:48:09,633 --> 00:48:11,601
Do you get me?
- Shut up, you fool!

698
00:48:12,566 --> 00:48:14,868
Mahinder may have changed me.

699
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,636
You'll see that I will
help him someday.

700
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:18,934
Patil !
- Yes.

701
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,801
Pack the clothes.
- I have done that.

702
00:48:20,866 --> 00:48:21,933
What should I do about this?

703
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,234
What is to be done about
this? Throw it away.

704
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:29,738
This will be with me.
- What will we do that?

705
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:33,901
This is my self-respect.

706
00:48:34,699 --> 00:48:36,835
Man should never forget who he is.

707
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,636
Your clothes are all fake.

708
00:48:40,933 --> 00:48:43,802
This is a real cloth as
it shows my poverty.

709
00:48:44,266 --> 00:48:46,601
It is like skin from my body.

710
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:50,937
It is my shroud. A black shroud.

711
00:48:51,633 --> 00:48:52,734
Do you get me?

712
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,169
Give me something, sir.
Please give me. .

713
00:49:02,233 --> 00:49:04,001
Have you been fooled by my clothes?

714
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,135
I am not a rich man. I belong
to the same stature as you.

715
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,601
Wait, let me see.

716
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,867
Hold this.

717
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,535
I don't have spare change.
Give that.

718
00:49:19,699 --> 00:49:21,601
Hail Kunwar Ranvir Singh!

719
00:49:21,633 --> 00:49:23,501
Hail Kunwar Ranvir Singh!

720
00:49:23,533 --> 00:49:25,001
Hail Kunwar Ranvir Singh! -Come here.

721
00:49:25,233 --> 00:49:26,901
Whom are they chanting for?
-Hail Kunwar Ranvir Singh!

722
00:49:26,966 --> 00:49:28,701
He is a rich man living here.
-Hail Kunwar Ranvir Singh!

723
00:49:28,766 --> 00:49:32,569
Every year he gives lakhs of
rupees to the poor as alms.

724
00:49:32,933 --> 00:49:37,570
What are you doing here? Go there.
- Hail Kunwar Ranvir Singh!

725
00:49:37,633 --> 00:49:39,501
Hail Kunwar Ranvir Singh!

726
00:49:39,566 --> 00:49:41,234
Hail Kunwar Ranvir Singh!

727
00:49:47,233 --> 00:49:51,537
Friends, I am not worthy of praise.

728
00:49:52,633 --> 00:49:58,171
An orphan and its likes.
Trouble for the society.

729
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,868
I hate such words.

730
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:04,501
By behaving well with such people. .

731
00:50:04,566 --> 00:50:09,504
. .by giving them food, clothing
and shelter to live. .

732
00:50:09,566 --> 00:50:13,803
. .people think that they
have done their duty.

733
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:18,970
No. They don't just need
food and clothing.

734
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,636
They are hungry for
Iove and affection.

735
00:50:24,699 --> 00:50:29,704
Love them. Move ahead
and embrace them.

736
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,067
Stop!

737
00:50:32,233 --> 00:50:35,169
If you are so compassionate,
then embrace me too!

738
00:50:35,233 --> 00:50:37,668
I too will have a father like you.

739
00:50:37,733 --> 00:50:41,837
Who are you?
- An orphan! A real orphan!

740
00:50:42,166 --> 00:50:45,235
Leave him. - Where
did he come from?

741
00:50:46,099 --> 00:50:49,603
Come here, son. Come here
and say what you want to.

742
00:51:00,666 --> 00:51:04,636
Come, child. Speak here.

743
00:51:05,766 --> 00:51:06,933
What should I say, sir?

744
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:13,504
All I want to say is that in
my childhood, I read a book.

745
00:51:14,166 --> 00:51:17,435
At nights, a dacoit would
steal from the people and. .

746
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:21,537
. .during the day he would return
their stuff back to them.

747
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:24,902
People would praise him
and touch his feet.

748
00:51:25,733 --> 00:51:28,168
I couldn't understand whether
he was a thief or a holy man.

749
00:51:29,666 --> 00:51:30,767
I will say another thing.

750
00:51:31,966 --> 00:51:34,435
The municipality that creates
a town keeps a. .

751
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:38,436
. .garbage dump everywhere
in the city.

752
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,801
So that the city is clean.

753
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:44,437
Similarly, these rich people,
for throwing their garbage. .

754
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,501
. .create an orphanage or an ashram.

755
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,701
I didn't mean to say
that for you, sir.

756
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,167
I will say one more thing!

757
00:51:54,166 --> 00:51:56,434
The Creator should
have made a meter. .

758
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,501
. .on everyone's forehead.

759
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,701
. .so that he would have his
father's name on his forehead.

760
00:52:02,766 --> 00:52:05,368
The world would know
which rich man. .

761
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:09,504
. .is this orphan's father.
Now tell me.

762
00:52:10,733 --> 00:52:13,368
Old age homes and orphanages
that have been made from. .

763
00:52:13,433 --> 00:52:15,501
. .donations from rich people
should imprison which people?

764
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,769
These innocent folk
or those rich people.

765
00:52:18,966 --> 00:52:22,469
They have given birth to such
orphans and left them!

766
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:28,001
That's all, sir. I only
wanted to say that.

767
00:52:28,766 --> 00:52:30,634
Forgive me if I said
something wrong.

768
00:52:30,699 --> 00:52:32,968
I am an orphan. I said whatever
came to my mind.

769
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,034
Now, I'm leaving.

770
00:52:51,466 --> 00:52:52,600
Greetings.
- Greetings.

771
00:52:52,966 --> 00:52:55,034
Do you have something to
eat? I'm very hungry.

772
00:52:55,099 --> 00:52:57,402
Yes, sir. Certainly.
- Excuse me, sir.

773
00:52:57,699 --> 00:52:59,568
Hello! Yes, I'm speaking. Yes.

774
00:53:00,866 --> 00:53:02,767
A packet of dog biscuits.

775
00:53:03,366 --> 00:53:04,633
Will you have it here
or take it home?

776
00:53:04,699 --> 00:53:05,767
What did you say?
- No.

777
00:53:08,433 --> 00:53:11,636
Here.
- Take this and keep the change.

778
00:53:11,933 --> 00:53:13,834
Your father has ample
money to be wasted.

779
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:15,434
Did you say something to me?

780
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,368
No. I didn't speak to you.

781
00:53:26,566 --> 00:53:28,734
What are you doing, sir?
They're dog biscuits!

782
00:53:29,433 --> 00:53:30,767
That's alright, brother.

783
00:53:31,533 --> 00:53:33,735
I am more connected to
dogs than to humans.

784
00:53:33,966 --> 00:53:36,768
Here's the money and
keep the change.

785
00:53:38,733 --> 00:53:42,036
That's strange.
- I forgot my biscuits.

786
00:53:42,533 --> 00:53:43,600
Strange man!

787
00:53:43,666 --> 00:53:45,300
Today, for the first time
in twenty years someone. .

788
00:53:45,333 --> 00:53:51,305
. .said such harsh words which
made all the events. .

789
00:53:51,366 --> 00:53:55,703
. .of my past come before
me, one by one.

790
00:53:56,433 --> 00:54:01,371
It was as though someone was
reading a book of my story.

791
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,536
Who said all this? Who was that man?

792
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:08,235
He was a young man. I was so
Iost in what he was saying..

793
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:11,302
. .that I didn't even ask
what his name was.

794
00:54:11,866 --> 00:54:14,368
You are lost in the
words of the world.

795
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:19,771
My son would keep shouting
and I would keep crying. .

796
00:54:19,833 --> 00:54:22,635
You just don't care about it.
You don't even look at us.

797
00:54:22,666 --> 00:54:23,733
May I come in?

798
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:33,469
You? - It appears I have
got a wrong address.

799
00:54:33,533 --> 00:54:36,502
I had come to meet Mr. Mahinder.

800
00:54:36,699 --> 00:54:39,335
No! You have come
to the right place.

801
00:54:39,699 --> 00:54:41,968
This is where Mahinder
stays. Come in.

802
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,603
Child, he is the same young
man about whom I told you.

803
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:55,234
He is nothing compared to my son.

804
00:54:55,266 --> 00:54:59,303
Kamini, use your presence
of mind before speaking.

805
00:55:01,566 --> 00:55:03,534
Call your brother.
- Yes, father.

806
00:55:04,766 --> 00:55:05,900
How did you come by?

807
00:55:06,333 --> 00:55:10,904
Mahinder called me.
- Mahinder is my son.

808
00:55:11,666 --> 00:55:13,701
Your son?
- Yes. Why?

809
00:55:15,766 --> 00:55:16,833
What happened?

810
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:20,370
No, I just.. he called me
here for a job. - Oh I see.

811
00:55:20,433 --> 00:55:21,500
He is that. .

812
00:55:25,266 --> 00:55:27,501
That's like Heera! That's good!

813
00:55:27,566 --> 00:55:29,167
Mahinder, for the first
time in your life. .

814
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:31,368
. .you have done something right.

815
00:55:31,666 --> 00:55:33,634
You have brought a right
man to a right place.

816
00:55:33,699 --> 00:55:34,767
Thank you, father.

817
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,168
Heera, you have come here
on the right day. .

818
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:38,701
. .and at the right time.

819
00:55:39,233 --> 00:55:43,236
Mahinder, time has never
been nice to me.

820
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,335
Still, I am very punctual.

821
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:47,401
You appear to have had a deep blow.

822
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:50,167
In twenty-five years,
I have had less food. .

823
00:55:50,233 --> 00:55:51,500
. .and more of wounds, father.

824
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:54,235
Wow! What a thing to say!

825
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,368
My son, you have spoken well!

826
00:55:56,466 --> 00:55:58,434
I remember an ode at this point.

827
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,135
No one cried at my wedding.

828
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:03,435
I am the only one who cried.

829
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:04,801
Very good, doctor.
- Thank you.

830
00:56:05,233 --> 00:56:07,435
This is my friend, Dr. Goyal.

831
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,468
In my past life, I was a cuckoo.

832
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:12,836
This time, I have been named
as Goyal by my parents.

833
00:56:13,099 --> 00:56:16,303
Mister, what is your name?
- Heera.

834
00:56:17,266 --> 00:56:18,567
You have a shining personality.

835
00:56:18,633 --> 00:56:22,536
Young man, you are slightly sad.

836
00:56:22,599 --> 00:56:25,502
If you eradicate that, your life
will be full of light. - Harzana.

837
00:56:28,199 --> 00:56:31,536
For Heera, vacate the doctor's
dispensary's upper room.

838
00:56:32,333 --> 00:56:33,434
He will work from tomorrow.

839
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:34,534
Explain his work to him as well.

840
00:56:36,733 --> 00:56:40,169
Listen, Heera. Meet me sometimes.

841
00:56:41,166 --> 00:56:43,668
I stay close to you. I work for you.

842
00:56:44,199 --> 00:56:45,267
I will keep meeting you.

843
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:50,434
Do you know about any girl?

844
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,468
Stop the vehicle. Stop it!
- Why?

845
00:56:52,533 --> 00:56:53,600
Don't you see? That cart is stuck.

846
00:56:53,666 --> 00:56:55,701
Why are you going there?
He is a very rotten man.

847
00:56:55,833 --> 00:56:57,100
If you help him today. .

848
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,437
Do you get me?
- I don't care about the future.

849
00:57:03,033 --> 00:57:07,337
The present is more important
for me. Understand?

850
00:57:10,133 --> 00:57:11,200
Please move back.

851
00:57:13,099 --> 00:57:14,167
Come on.

852
00:57:19,133 --> 00:57:21,668
Very good. Very good.

853
00:57:24,166 --> 00:57:26,401
Go ahead!
- Very good. Very good!

854
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:32,267
Thanks a lot, sir.

855
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,034
If you wouldn't have helped
me, I couldn't have. .

856
00:57:34,099 --> 00:57:36,168
. .reached the market at the
right time to sell my wares.

857
00:57:37,266 --> 00:57:39,668
Do you make clay vessels?
- Yes, sir.

858
00:57:40,033 --> 00:57:42,034
God made us from the earth and for. .

859
00:57:42,066 --> 00:57:44,134
. .feeding ourselves we
make earthen vessels.

860
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:47,102
Sir, this is my younger
sister Channo.

861
00:57:47,166 --> 00:57:48,500
Greetings.
- My name is Ram Singh.

862
00:57:48,566 --> 00:57:51,101
Yes! Alright! Come along,
sir. It's getting late.

863
00:57:51,266 --> 00:57:53,401
ok.
- His long dialogue will never end.

864
00:57:56,666 --> 00:57:59,368
So sir, we have come to Chandanwadi.

865
00:58:00,033 --> 00:58:01,467
This entire plot is ours.

866
00:58:04,066 --> 00:58:08,036
Deals worth lakhs are done
here, in Chandanwadi.

867
00:58:08,633 --> 00:58:10,267
This is our wood cutting place.

868
00:58:10,566 --> 00:58:12,100
All types of wood is shaped here.

869
00:58:14,466 --> 00:58:16,000
Sir, we have reached.

870
00:58:18,633 --> 00:58:21,702
This is one store and there
are four such places.

871
00:58:22,033 --> 00:58:23,968
From today, all these
places and people. .

872
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:25,267
. .will work under your command.

873
00:58:25,433 --> 00:58:27,401
Only your word will
be followed here.

874
00:58:27,966 --> 00:58:31,069
This is our new manager! Salute him!

875
00:58:34,433 --> 00:58:37,702
You fools! I'll cut your salary!

876
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,101
Raju! Salute him!

877
00:58:42,099 --> 00:58:43,201
Go, do your work.

878
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,336
He is our employee, sir.
He really is an idiot.

879
00:58:52,566 --> 00:58:54,134
He never works honestly.

880
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,702
Now that you have come, you will
set him right. I know it.

881
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,335
Here comes another fool.
What do we do about him?

882
00:59:02,199 --> 00:59:07,004
He will be dealt with in the
same way as the others.

883
00:59:07,233 --> 00:59:12,204
Come in, sir. Come. This
is our control tower.

884
00:59:13,099 --> 00:59:15,268
You can sit here and keep
a watch on everyone.

885
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,235
Such as what work is
being done by whom.

886
00:59:17,533 --> 00:59:19,134
From today, this is your office.

887
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:29,967
Whose pictures are these?

888
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:31,567
Sir, these are our former managers.

889
00:59:31,633 --> 00:59:33,034
They are all dead now.

890
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:39,335
Do you see him? He was
Sardar (Sikh) Keher Singh.

891
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:41,201
He liked roaming about.

892
00:59:41,466 --> 00:59:44,502
He went out for a stroll
one day and was killed.

893
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:49,270
Look at him. He was
a strict manager.

894
00:59:49,433 --> 00:59:50,934
One day, he left for a round.

895
00:59:51,099 --> 00:59:52,901
When he left, he was fine but when. .

896
00:59:52,933 --> 00:59:57,270
. .he returned he was dead.
Do you get me?

897
00:59:58,133 --> 01:00:00,401
Look at him. He was a good man.

898
01:00:00,466 --> 01:00:02,434
He would never feel bad
about anything I said.

899
01:00:03,033 --> 01:00:04,901
One day he felt offended
about something that. .

900
01:00:04,966 --> 01:00:07,068
. .the labourers said. His picture
came into the frame.

901
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:09,400
Why is this frame empty?

902
01:00:09,566 --> 01:00:13,436
Sir, last time, two frames
were made by mistake.

903
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:18,204
Now you have come.. understand?

904
01:00:19,066 --> 01:00:22,035
Come along, I'll show you
how to work here. - Come.

905
01:00:22,366 --> 01:00:24,034
Work, planning and punishment.

906
01:00:24,133 --> 01:00:25,200
Do you see this?

907
01:00:25,433 --> 01:00:26,901
If a person does a minute
mistake, he is to. .

908
01:00:26,933 --> 01:00:28,534
. .be beaten with a
small blow, a whip.

909
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,901
If a person does a big
mistake, he is to. .

910
01:00:30,966 --> 01:00:32,033
. .be beaten with a big blow, a rod.

911
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:33,901
If you get a man who
is worse than that..

912
01:00:33,966 --> 01:00:35,300
. .a sword has been kept.

913
01:00:35,566 --> 01:00:38,135
Sir, even after that if no
one comes under control. .

914
01:00:38,433 --> 01:00:39,500
Follow me then.

915
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:47,904
I'll show you now. This
is our last way.

916
01:00:50,633 --> 01:00:54,370
Use them freely, understand?

917
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:59,436
From today, you will
keep this. Here.

918
01:01:00,033 --> 01:01:03,336
The one who spat outside.
- Mukadam?

919
01:01:03,366 --> 01:01:04,467
Yes.
- Ok.

920
01:01:04,533 --> 01:01:05,934
Send him upstairs.
- In a moment.

921
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:11,567
Mukadam!
- What is it?

922
01:01:12,833 --> 01:01:14,935
Mukadam, you have been called
by the new manager.

923
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:16,967
Upstairs.

924
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:31,167
It looks as though he is doomed.

925
01:01:31,866 --> 01:01:33,067
I'll have to get his photograph too.

926
01:01:35,966 --> 01:01:37,133
He had just arrived and
he is going to die.

927
01:01:37,833 --> 01:01:39,568
The poor guy will be killed.

928
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:10,069
I wanted to promote Mukadam
and make him a manager.

929
01:02:11,066 --> 01:02:13,968
I wanted to add his photo
to the empty frame.

930
01:02:14,766 --> 01:02:17,135
When he said that he had three
children, I stopped.

931
01:02:18,199 --> 01:02:20,902
I thought that those kids
would turn orphans like me.

932
01:02:23,833 --> 01:02:24,900
Harzana.
- Yes, sir.

933
01:02:26,233 --> 01:02:31,004
Keep this key. I don't need this.

934
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:35,770
Put this into his pocket and
when he is conscious. .

935
01:02:35,833 --> 01:02:38,769
. .explain to him that my way
of working is different.

936
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:45,003
Understand? Salute him! Everyone.

937
01:02:47,833 --> 01:02:48,900
Where is Mr. Mahinder?

938
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:53,503
He must be worshipping
a Goddess at this time.

939
01:02:58,699 --> 01:03:04,138
My darling! These soft hands
are like flowers and velvet.

940
01:03:04,699 --> 01:03:06,168
They are not to be used
to clean this car.

941
01:03:06,766 --> 01:03:09,201
They are for caressing
my heart. Come on.

942
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:16,738
My dearest, I don't like blue
soap on your fair cheeks.

943
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:19,702
Today, I'll finish cleaning you up.

944
01:03:21,033 --> 01:03:23,735
Accountant, may I say something?

945
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:28,003
Your car is 100 years old.
You never sat inside.

946
01:03:28,699 --> 01:03:30,935
You have removed the engine
and kept it under your bed.

947
01:03:31,233 --> 01:03:33,702
Now why are you being cruel to her?

948
01:03:34,099 --> 01:03:36,435
I have told you numerous
times to keep a servant.

949
01:03:37,133 --> 01:03:38,834
Mr. Mahinder Bahadur.

950
01:03:39,166 --> 01:03:42,435
I am not so fortunate
to employ servants.

951
01:03:42,933 --> 01:03:47,837
I just have a girl. She might
prove to be lucky to me.

952
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:50,268
She will.
- Yes.

953
01:03:51,966 --> 01:03:55,069
Accountant, may I go in?

954
01:03:55,366 --> 01:03:59,737
Certainly, young man. Go in.
This is like your house.

955
01:04:02,166 --> 01:04:03,233
Thank you.

956
01:04:06,699 --> 01:04:09,636
My chess board! You ruined my game!

957
01:04:09,699 --> 01:04:12,235
Accountant, look before
you set up a game.

958
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:14,635
Otherwise it will be ruined.
- Who are you?

959
01:04:14,699 --> 01:04:16,935
Accountant, he is our
new manager, Heera.

960
01:04:16,966 --> 01:04:20,169
Ok, forgive me. My play
was stopped so I. .

961
01:04:20,866 --> 01:04:22,634
Treat him well.
- ok.

962
01:04:22,666 --> 01:04:24,801
Mahinder! Mahinder!

963
01:04:27,233 --> 01:04:28,834
You? Why did you get him here?

964
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:29,967
Sir, I haven't brought him. .

965
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:31,667
No, Mahinder! I came here
by my own accord.

966
01:04:32,099 --> 01:04:34,735
I saw all your places. I thought
about seeing this place too.

967
01:04:35,166 --> 01:04:36,901
If I have to get to
you in a emergency. .

968
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:38,733
Greetings, sister-in-law.

969
01:04:39,633 --> 01:04:40,700
You really are weird!
Whoever you see with me. .

970
01:04:40,766 --> 01:04:42,067
. .you address her as sister-in-law!

971
01:04:42,266 --> 01:04:44,668
What? Did he call someone
else sister-in-law too?

972
01:04:45,066 --> 01:04:47,067
No, darling. He has
a habit of joking.

973
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:51,636
Listen, I liked you calling
me as sister-in-law.

974
01:04:52,266 --> 01:04:54,334
Always call me sister-in-law
from now on.

975
01:04:54,866 --> 01:04:56,834
Alright, he will call
you sister-in-law.

976
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,302
Now go in. I have some work. Go.

977
01:05:00,633 --> 01:05:02,134
You will..
- Mr. Mahinder!

978
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:05,134
I have seen your jungle,
house and office.

979
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:06,734
Now explain to me what
work is to be done?

980
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:10,002
Come here. We own
Iand on Kali Tekdi.

981
01:05:10,099 --> 01:05:11,868
Some slum dwellers have
usurped that land.

982
01:05:12,233 --> 01:05:13,567
You just have to move
them from there.

983
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:17,568
You mean, the people
who live there. .

984
01:05:17,633 --> 01:05:19,201
. .are to be rendered homeless.

985
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:23,702
I want to make a brilliant
five-star hotel there.

986
01:05:24,699 --> 01:05:29,704
Ok! The poor folk will get a
place to stay in that hotel?

987
01:05:31,066 --> 01:05:32,133
Heera, are you insane?

988
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,768
Will slum dwellers reside
in a five-star hotel?

989
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,569
No. I thought that as
the government says. .

990
01:05:37,633 --> 01:05:38,900
Eradicate poverty, break down slums.

991
01:05:38,966 --> 01:05:40,567
Make homes and let the poor stay.

992
01:05:40,766 --> 01:05:41,933
Perhaps you thought about the same.

993
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,568
No! I don't have such plans.

994
01:05:44,133 --> 01:05:46,935
You mean you don't want to
eradicate poverty but the poor.

995
01:05:48,566 --> 01:05:50,634
I'll remove them.
- Listen.

996
01:05:51,566 --> 01:05:53,067
There is a Hanuman temple.

997
01:05:54,966 --> 01:06:01,005
Oh! Along with humans, you
want to throw out Gods too.

998
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,134
I'll do it.
- That's it!

999
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:19,167
Sir!

1000
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:21,501
Sir, should I tell you something?

1001
01:06:22,099 --> 01:06:24,669
A miracle has taken place.
Heera has cleared the slum!

1002
01:06:25,133 --> 01:06:27,668
Very good! Get out of this room!

1003
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:31,503
ok.
- Did you see my likes, darling?

1004
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,501
Something that couldn't
be done all my life. .

1005
01:06:33,533 --> 01:06:34,834
.. Heera did it for me.

1006
01:06:35,633 --> 01:06:37,568
I think this man is a real jewel.

1007
01:06:37,633 --> 01:06:38,700
Hail Mahinder!

1008
01:06:38,766 --> 01:06:41,835
Hail Mahinder! Hail Mahinder!

1009
01:06:42,566 --> 01:06:45,502
Did you hear that?
- People are praising you. - Me?

1010
01:06:45,566 --> 01:06:46,633
Hail Mahinder!

1011
01:06:46,699 --> 01:06:47,967
Hail Mahinder!

1012
01:06:48,166 --> 01:06:50,234
Hail Mahinder!

1013
01:06:51,833 --> 01:06:54,101
Hail Mahinder!

1014
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:57,502
Young man, you are being
praised outside my house.

1015
01:06:57,766 --> 01:06:59,100
What deed have you done?

1016
01:06:59,699 --> 01:07:03,136
I was just.. I have been
in since morning.

1017
01:07:03,966 --> 01:07:08,937
Friends, this is the place.
This is Mahinder.

1018
01:07:08,966 --> 01:07:12,602
Touch his feet! For Mahinder. .

1019
01:07:12,666 --> 01:07:14,567
Hail Mahinder!

1020
01:07:14,633 --> 01:07:15,700
Hail Mahinder! -Shut up!

1021
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:18,667
What is this
rubbish, Heera?

1022
01:07:19,166 --> 01:07:21,434
Rubbish? There has been
no mistake, sir.

1023
01:07:21,833 --> 01:07:23,634
These people have come to thank you.

1024
01:07:24,433 --> 01:07:26,434
Thank me for what?

1025
01:07:27,066 --> 01:07:29,435
Sir, you had their huts broken down.

1026
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,768
Then you gave them place to stay
in the accountant's house.

1027
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:34,869
In my house?
- Yes.

1028
01:07:35,133 --> 01:07:37,435
You were ousted by Mahinder yet. .

1029
01:07:37,466 --> 01:07:40,068
. .you want to invade my house?

1030
01:07:41,433 --> 01:07:44,869
Accountant, just two and
a half people stay here.

1031
01:07:45,433 --> 01:07:48,836
You, your wife and your daughter..
who is dim-witted.

1032
01:07:49,433 --> 01:07:50,867
There is one chess board
and a few counters.

1033
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:52,801
There will be loneliness here.

1034
01:07:53,099 --> 01:07:54,434
If these people stay here, there. .

1035
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:55,701
. .would be some noise and activity.

1036
01:07:55,766 --> 01:07:56,800
Isn't that so? Come, brothers!

1037
01:07:57,433 --> 01:07:58,967
Four people are to get
in one room! Come on!

1038
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:00,634
No one is to go in!

1039
01:08:01,366 --> 01:08:04,502
Heera, don't mess with
me. Get them out!

1040
01:08:04,733 --> 01:08:06,668
Accountant, why do you worry?

1041
01:08:07,366 --> 01:08:10,402
r
When I had to clear Kali Tekdi
I used a bulldozer.

1042
01:08:10,566 --> 01:08:12,901
If I want to clear this house,
I'll use a bulldozer again.

1043
01:08:13,566 --> 01:08:14,967
Heera, what is this nonsense!
- Mahinder!

1044
01:08:17,566 --> 01:08:18,633
Father.

1045
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:28,637
Mahinder.
- Father, why have you come here?

1046
01:08:28,699 --> 01:08:32,370
Who told you to ruin
this settlement?

1047
01:08:32,633 --> 01:08:33,834
You made these poor people homeless.

1048
01:08:34,533 --> 01:08:35,867
Father, I..
- Sir.

1049
01:08:37,433 --> 01:08:38,801
Sir, you are scolding
him without a reason.

1050
01:08:39,466 --> 01:08:41,367
You should embrace him today.

1051
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,701
Mahinder has done such
a big favour to you.

1052
01:08:43,966 --> 01:08:45,100
You can't estimate that.

1053
01:08:48,366 --> 01:08:50,367
He has cleared these people's
old huts and. .

1054
01:08:50,433 --> 01:08:54,036
. .promised to make a better
colony for them.

1055
01:08:54,366 --> 01:08:56,367
Until that time, he has permitted. .

1056
01:08:58,466 --> 01:08:59,533
Isn't that right, Mahinder?

1057
01:09:01,033 --> 01:09:02,934
Mahinder?
- Yes, father.

1058
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:10,302
This is the second right
thing that you have done.

1059
01:09:15,833 --> 01:09:18,302
Come, brothers! Come on in.

1060
01:09:19,933 --> 01:09:23,803
Four people in a room.
Not more than four.

1061
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:26,602
Very good. Stay here.
- Young man.

1062
01:09:26,933 --> 01:09:29,302
This man that you have
brought from the city. .

1063
01:09:29,366 --> 01:09:33,036
. .if kept here, will harass
you all your life.

1064
01:09:33,366 --> 01:09:34,467
Do you understand what harassment is?

1065
01:09:35,966 --> 01:09:39,302
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1066
01:09:42,366 --> 01:09:43,433
Go on. Heera?

1067
01:09:44,666 --> 01:09:48,436
Sir, I was passing by and felt
like seeing you. So I came.

1068
01:09:48,633 --> 01:09:49,700
Come in.

1069
01:09:50,733 --> 01:09:52,734
You have wasted al your bank
balance in donations.

1070
01:09:53,533 --> 01:09:55,301
Will you keep something
for us or not?

1071
01:09:55,433 --> 01:09:57,301
Why? Everything is alright.
What do we need?

1072
01:09:57,633 --> 01:10:00,302
'Alright?' My son, Mahinder,
will have his birthday soon.

1073
01:10:00,466 --> 01:10:02,034
I want to buy a new
Mercedes for him.

1074
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:03,367
I want six lakh rupees.

1075
01:10:03,433 --> 01:10:05,301
Kamini, your son Mahinder isn't. .

1076
01:10:05,366 --> 01:10:08,702
. .so young that he
still needs gifts.

1077
01:10:09,366 --> 01:10:11,334
He is old enough to take the
business into his control.

1078
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,401
To give you from his earnings.

1079
01:10:13,533 --> 01:10:15,301
Whenever I ask you for something. .

1080
01:10:15,366 --> 01:10:17,701
. .or for my son Mahinder,
you argue with me.

1081
01:10:17,766 --> 01:10:21,336
I am not arguing. I am telling
you to explain to your son.

1082
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:24,301
The aim of life isn't
just to move about in. .

1083
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:26,702
. .air-conditioned cars.
It's something else.

1084
01:10:26,733 --> 01:10:28,301
What's your aim in life?

1085
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:31,536
To spend lakhs and crores of
rupees to earn false praises?

1086
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:34,602
Lady, sir is right.
- Shut up!

1087
01:10:34,933 --> 01:10:38,703
You're an outsider. Don't dare
to intervene! Understand?

1088
01:10:40,733 --> 01:10:43,335
Beggars and orphans!
Will they help you?

1089
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:47,303
In old age, you will shiver
and be stuck to your bed.

1090
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:50,336
No orphan such as him
will come to help you.

1091
01:10:50,699 --> 01:10:52,301
Then you'll remember your son.

1092
01:10:53,366 --> 01:10:55,601
I don't know where these people
come from for alms.

1093
01:10:59,666 --> 01:11:00,733
Alright, sir. I'm leaving.

1094
01:11:02,266 --> 01:11:05,369
Heera.
- Yes, sir?

1095
01:11:05,733 --> 01:11:06,800
Heera. .

1096
01:11:09,233 --> 01:11:12,903
. .why are you crying for me?

1097
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:19,671
My son has never cried for me.
I am so unfortunate!

1098
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:24,236
I wish you would have been my son!

1099
01:11:24,699 --> 01:11:25,767
May I come in?

1100
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:33,937
Come, doctor.
- What is it? Your eyes are wet.

1101
01:11:35,366 --> 01:11:41,238
Doctor, I saw Heera
crying and wept too.

1102
01:11:41,633 --> 01:11:43,968
It isn't bad to weep, Mr. Kumar.

1103
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:48,670
They are good for the eyes
and bad for the heart.

1104
01:11:48,733 --> 01:11:51,235
I remember that when I was born. .

1105
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:53,468
. .my father wept miserably.

1106
01:11:53,633 --> 01:11:56,736
Kunwar, at that time I
decided not to marry.

1107
01:11:56,899 --> 01:12:00,169
If I were married today,
I would cry for my son. .

1108
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:02,602
. .just as you are crying.

1109
01:12:02,766 --> 01:12:05,168
Uncle, when you start speaking
you don't stop.

1110
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:08,169
Tell me, when did father
had to cry due to me?

1111
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:09,868
I wasn't saying that.

1112
01:12:10,166 --> 01:12:13,802
I said that you should take
care of your father.

1113
01:12:13,899 --> 01:12:15,668
Now look, medicines have been
required since two days.

1114
01:12:15,733 --> 01:12:16,900
Go to town and get them.

1115
01:12:17,566 --> 01:12:19,167
You mean, I stay in this
house just because. .

1116
01:12:19,233 --> 01:12:20,901
. .I am to get medicines from town?

1117
01:12:21,633 --> 01:12:24,435
Father, aren't there any retainers
who can help you?

1118
01:12:25,366 --> 01:12:27,901
My friends are waiting for me.
I'm going for hunting.

1119
01:12:28,166 --> 01:12:32,503
Go. Doctor, is this medicine
very necessary to be taken?

1120
01:12:32,566 --> 01:12:34,167
Yes.
- Give me that, doctor.

1121
01:12:35,433 --> 01:12:38,169
Father, till I am here
in this house. .

1122
01:12:38,199 --> 01:12:41,369
. .you don't have to worry
about such work.

1123
01:12:41,766 --> 01:12:44,869
I'll get the medicines.
- The city is far away.

1124
01:12:45,466 --> 01:12:47,835
How far, sir? It is in India, right?

1125
01:12:51,766 --> 01:12:53,901
Pardon me, madam. You
can't take the dog in.

1126
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:56,201
Mind your own business.
He isn't an ordinary dog.

1127
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:02,101
Madam. Madam! Excuse me, madam.

1128
01:13:02,199 --> 01:13:03,501
You are not allowed to bring
a dog inside this hotel.

1129
01:13:03,566 --> 01:13:05,734
I don't go anywhere without my dog.

1130
01:13:05,833 --> 01:13:09,403
That's good! That
is a very warm dog.

1131
01:13:09,699 --> 01:13:11,601
I mean, hot dog.

1132
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:15,302
Look, madam. Our customers
may object to it.

1133
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,835
We can't trust a dog. He
may dirty this place.

1134
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:20,602
You don't know this dog.
He is my dog!

1135
01:13:20,699 --> 01:13:23,736
He's always with me. Understand?

1136
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:27,702
Look, madam. We don't care what
your dog does with you.

1137
01:13:27,766 --> 01:13:30,235
We can't allow your dog to
come inside this hotel.

1138
01:13:30,433 --> 01:13:31,700
What if he causes us a loss?

1139
01:13:31,833 --> 01:13:34,368
If he causes you a loss,
I'll pay the money.

1140
01:13:34,633 --> 01:13:36,234
It's very spicy!

1141
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:40,735
The pepper. These mountain
peppers are too hot!

1142
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:44,302
Madam, I have told you.
- I have told you too.

1143
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:46,801
My dog will eat with me.

1144
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:52,737
Add his bill to mine. Thank you.

1145
01:13:52,833 --> 01:13:54,701
Madam, we don't let a dog in.

1146
01:13:54,766 --> 01:13:56,134
There is no question of feeding him.

1147
01:13:56,199 --> 01:13:57,568
Stupid.
- What did you say?

1148
01:13:58,433 --> 01:14:00,535
I didn't say that to you but my dog.

1149
01:14:00,766 --> 01:14:02,033
His name is stupid.

1150
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:05,668
However, he is cleverer
than you are.

1151
01:14:08,033 --> 01:14:10,635
Listen to me, Stupid.
Wait here for me.

1152
01:14:11,033 --> 01:14:12,334
Don't move and don't be naughty.

1153
01:14:12,533 --> 01:14:15,769
Are you married?
- Yes. I have 1 1 kids.

1154
01:14:16,033 --> 01:14:17,567
Yes. You may have 11 kids
but are you married?

1155
01:14:18,033 --> 01:14:19,067
Sir, why are you joking?

1156
01:14:22,433 --> 01:14:24,234
Why don't you have a separate
table for dogs?

1157
01:14:24,766 --> 01:14:26,767
I wasn't speaking to you.
I spoke to the manager.

1158
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:28,601
Manager.
- Yes.

1159
01:14:28,766 --> 01:14:31,034
Why don't you have a separate
table for dogs?

1160
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:34,102
Yes! Have a special table made.

1161
01:14:34,166 --> 01:14:35,767
Write upon it that
it's a dog's table.

1162
01:14:36,199 --> 01:14:38,335
Very funny! Why don't you
mind your own business?

1163
01:14:38,433 --> 01:14:39,500
She's speaking to you.

1164
01:14:54,633 --> 01:14:55,667
Puppy!

1165
01:15:02,966 --> 01:15:05,368
Hello puppy! Stupid little puppy!

1166
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,067
Come on, doggy.

1167
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:14,069
Yes! Do you know what this is?

1168
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,301
Waiter! Throw out the dog!

1169
01:15:27,399 --> 01:15:28,467
Get in!

1170
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:31,567
Waiter!

1171
01:15:43,033 --> 01:15:44,200
You idiot!

1172
01:15:44,366 --> 01:15:45,967
Very good, go up!

1173
01:15:49,066 --> 01:15:50,133
Well done!

1174
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:53,367
Come on, run.

1175
01:15:53,433 --> 01:15:54,500
Waiter! - Yes, sir.

1176
01:15:54,566 --> 01:15:56,034
Come to me, Stupid.

1177
01:15:57,199 --> 01:15:58,901
Your dog has ruined the whole hotel.

1178
01:15:59,133 --> 01:16:00,400
He harassed all the customers.

1179
01:16:00,899 --> 01:16:03,068
How much damage did he do?
- Damage!

1180
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:04,367
Take this.

1181
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,267
Madam, it's not about the money.

1182
01:16:08,333 --> 01:16:09,967
The customers have been
caused an inconvenience.

1183
01:16:10,033 --> 01:16:13,236
The hotel will be defamed.
- Take this.

1184
01:16:13,333 --> 01:16:14,400
Why don't you understand?

1185
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:17,436
If this isn't enough, call at
my home and order a cheque, ok?

1186
01:16:17,966 --> 01:16:23,504
''Just because you got
a little money.''

1187
01:16:23,566 --> 01:16:26,402
''You think that you are God.''

1188
01:16:27,633 --> 01:16:36,341
''Only God would know what
will happen to you now.''

1189
01:16:37,166 --> 01:16:39,067
''Why are you so arrogant?''

1190
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:44,471
''Why are you arrogant
about your money?''

1191
01:16:44,566 --> 01:16:49,103
''Why are you arrogant
about your money?''

1192
01:16:49,233 --> 01:16:51,001
''This money.. ''

1193
01:16:51,366 --> 01:16:56,237
''This money will take you
away from your loved ones.''

1194
01:16:56,433 --> 01:16:58,067
''It will take you away.''

1195
01:16:58,233 --> 01:17:02,971
''Why are you arrogant
about your money?''

1196
01:17:03,233 --> 01:17:05,835
''Why are you so arrogant?''

1197
01:17:14,566 --> 01:17:21,239
''In big houses filled
with gold and silver.''

1198
01:17:21,833 --> 01:17:26,070
''There is more pain
and lesser calm.''

1199
01:17:26,366 --> 01:17:30,570
''There is more pain
and lesser calm.''

1200
01:17:31,033 --> 01:17:37,839
''Rich people of this age. .''

1201
01:17:37,966 --> 01:17:42,236
''They have snatched love
and broken hearts. ''

1202
01:17:42,466 --> 01:17:47,070
''They have snatched love
and broken hearts. ''

1203
01:17:48,233 --> 01:17:53,838
''I don't say that m:ney
isn't important.

1204
01:17:54,266 --> 01:17:59,771
''However, money isn't everything. ''

1205
01:18:01,333 --> 01:18:05,503
''Man is man and money is money.''

1206
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:10,170
''My heart is like yours too.''

1207
01:18:10,766 --> 01:18:15,170
''Money is good and bad as well.''

1208
01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:19,504
''It's poisonous an,,d
intoxicating too.

1209
01:18:19,933 --> 01:18:24,237
''It's poisonous an,,d
intoxicating too.

1210
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:26,268
''This intoxication.. ''

1211
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,504
''This intoxication does cheat us. ''

1212
01:18:31,833 --> 01:18:33,968
''This money.. ''

1213
01:18:34,166 --> 01:18:38,970
''This money will take you
away from your loved ones.''

1214
01:18:39,133 --> 01:18:40,767
''It will take you away.''

1215
01:18:40,899 --> 01:18:45,504
''Why are you arrogant
about your money?''

1216
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,102
''Why are you so arrogant?''

1217
01:18:49,833 --> 01:18:51,834
''Where are you going?''

1218
01:18:52,899 --> 01:18:59,306
''How many things can
you buy with money?''

1219
01:18:59,699 --> 01:19:05,806
''Can you buy a heart or life?''

1220
01:19:05,933 --> 01:19:08,802
''Love isn't sold in a market.''

1221
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:12,036
''A beloved isn't sold at a shop.''

1222
01:19:12,266 --> 01:19:15,369
''Flowers are sold. Its
fragrance is not.''

1223
01:19:15,733 --> 01:19:18,735
''Our bodies may be sold.
Our mind can't be sold.''

1224
01:19:18,833 --> 01:19:21,902
''Rest and dreams can't be sold.''

1225
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:25,169
''Restless desires of the
heart can't be sold. ''

1226
01:19:25,233 --> 01:19:31,872
''How many things can
you buy with money?''

1227
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:38,339
''Can you buy a heart or life?''

1228
01:19:42,433 --> 01:19:48,071
''How much can you pay for the wind?''

1229
01:19:48,866 --> 01:19:54,004
''How can you value this beauty?''

1230
01:19:54,800 --> 01:20:00,205
''You may have money for the land.''

1231
01:20:00,866 --> 01:20:06,404
''How can you value the skies?''

1232
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:11,036
''How much can you pay for the wind?''

1233
01:20:11,133 --> 01:20:14,336
''How can you value this beauty?''

1234
01:20:14,699 --> 01:20:17,702
''You may have money for the land.''

1235
01:20:17,899 --> 01:20:20,869
''How can you value the skies?''

1236
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:24,837
''If you have a little money,
this world is lovely.''

1237
01:20:24,899 --> 01:20:26,301
''This world is lovely.''

1238
01:20:27,699 --> 01:20:31,303
''If you have more than required,
then believe me.''

1239
01:20:31,366 --> 01:20:33,000
''Believe me. ''

1240
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:35,934
''In your mind. .''

1241
01:20:36,366 --> 01:20:40,737
''It creates problems in a mind.''

1242
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,701
''This money.. ''

1243
01:20:42,766 --> 01:20:47,203
''This money will take you
away from your loved ones.''

1244
01:20:47,366 --> 01:20:48,900
''It will take you away.''

1245
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:53,304
''Why are you arrogant
about your money?''

1246
01:20:53,433 --> 01:20:55,768
''Why are you so arrogant?''

1247
01:20:58,066 --> 01:21:00,334
Medicines. Here's the spare.

1248
01:21:00,733 --> 01:21:02,801
Give that to father.
- No!

1249
01:21:02,899 --> 01:21:05,636
Before money takes me away
from my loved ones. .

1250
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:07,868
. .I should separate
myself from money.

1251
01:21:08,066 --> 01:21:10,701
What are you saying, brother?
- The matter is such.

1252
01:21:11,633 --> 01:21:15,003
Today, as I was moving about,
I saw a girl like thing.

1253
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:17,201
A girl like thing?
- Yes.

1254
01:21:17,699 --> 01:21:19,368
She appeared to be a girl.

1255
01:21:19,866 --> 01:21:22,635
She was always ready to attack.

1256
01:21:22,699 --> 01:21:25,736
She was too short-tempered.
She had her father's money.

1257
01:21:26,133 --> 01:21:28,301
You may assume her to be
a moving treasure chest.

1258
01:21:28,833 --> 01:21:30,634
Chest? Whom are you talking about?

1259
01:21:30,666 --> 01:21:31,767
The same girl like thing.

1260
01:21:32,133 --> 01:21:35,636
However, I showed such
presence of mind. .

1261
01:21:35,699 --> 01:21:37,134
. .that you will see it's result.

1262
01:21:37,899 --> 01:21:39,134
When will I see it?
- Your next life.

1263
01:21:39,899 --> 01:21:41,101
Next life?
- Yes.

1264
01:21:42,966 --> 01:21:47,036
After today, that girl
will pray to God.

1265
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:50,903
'O God, don't let me be born
in a rich man's house# 

1266
01:21:55,633 --> 01:22:02,806
'O God, don't let me be born in a.# 

1267
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:07,703
You? How did you come here?

1268
01:22:10,633 --> 01:22:13,569
No, Mohini, Madhu. A girl like thing.

1269
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:17,936
Yes, Madhu. I am that
girl like thing.

1270
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:21,636
I am filled with arrogance
due to my father's money.

1271
01:22:21,766 --> 01:22:24,902
You're strange. You
are so young and. .

1272
01:22:24,966 --> 01:22:27,902
Shut up! Remember this.

1273
01:22:28,566 --> 01:22:29,633
When someone is a 'somebody'. .

1274
01:22:29,699 --> 01:22:31,201
. .he assumes himself to be valuable.

1275
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:34,102
A homeless beggar won't
be proud of his father.

1276
01:22:34,699 --> 01:22:35,767
What?
- Yes.

1277
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:38,702
If your father has money,
show it off!

1278
01:22:38,899 --> 01:22:39,967
Mohini, please!

1279
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,569
Madhu, you don't know what
this man did today.

1280
01:22:42,899 --> 01:22:46,737
This incident today will bring
your family, mother, father. .

1281
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,168
Don't speak against my father.

1282
01:22:48,233 --> 01:22:49,801
You spoke against my father first!

1283
01:22:50,066 --> 01:22:52,735
My father has respect and
a position in society.

1284
01:22:53,066 --> 01:22:54,734
He has educated me.

1285
01:22:55,566 --> 01:22:57,501
He has made me capable
of living in society.

1286
01:22:57,899 --> 01:22:59,501
What has your father taught you?

1287
01:22:59,766 --> 01:23:02,168
To tease and insult girls?

1288
01:23:02,966 --> 01:23:05,501
Only people who don't have
self-respect would do that.

1289
01:23:05,566 --> 01:23:08,068
Enough! Don't say
a word beyond that.

1290
01:23:08,133 --> 01:23:11,603
What will you do? Will you
kill me? What can you do?

1291
01:23:11,633 --> 01:23:14,002
Stop it, Mohini.
- How can I let it go, Madhu?

1292
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:17,169
I am not scared of such
disgraceful orphans!

1293
01:23:17,633 --> 01:23:19,601
Please! For my sake. Let's go.

1294
01:23:24,566 --> 01:23:25,633
An orphan.

1295
01:23:28,566 --> 01:23:32,703
Madhu, the creator has
put life into stones.

1296
01:23:32,833 --> 01:23:35,936
This is nothing, dear. Come
inside and take a look.

1297
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:39,502
You would feel as though
statues will. .

1298
01:23:39,566 --> 01:23:41,868
. .come off the walls and talk to us.

1299
01:23:41,933 --> 01:23:43,501
Come along. Come, Mohini.

1300
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,801
Go on. I'm coming.
- ok.

1301
01:24:08,733 --> 01:24:11,635
You?
- Yes, it's me.

1302
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:13,734
Why have you come here?

1303
01:24:15,466 --> 01:24:18,836
I have come here to reply to
what you said at the house.

1304
01:24:18,933 --> 01:24:21,035
If you had a reply, you would have
given it to me at that place.

1305
01:24:22,066 --> 01:24:23,167
I could have.

1306
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:28,470
Here, I thought you are trying
to enjoy these statues.

1307
01:24:28,533 --> 01:24:31,702
So, I thought I'd introduce
you to living people.

1308
01:24:32,066 --> 01:24:33,834
I don't want to listen
to your rubbish.

1309
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:37,868
You will listen, princess!

1310
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:41,702
You spoke before Madhu
and I heard it.

1311
01:24:41,766 --> 01:24:43,134
Now I will speak and
you will hear me out.

1312
01:24:44,033 --> 01:24:47,169
You called me an orphan.
Do you know what that is?

1313
01:24:50,166 --> 01:24:52,868
Madam, an orphan is like
an insect from a gutter.

1314
01:24:52,933 --> 01:24:54,467
He can neither live nor die.

1315
01:24:55,066 --> 01:24:58,736
People throw him onto the
footpath as their sins.

1316
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:01,768
Even death doesn't accept him.

1317
01:25:02,033 --> 01:25:04,969
It leaves him numb for people
like you to hurt him.

1318
01:25:09,033 --> 01:25:10,534
You were born inside a house, right?

1319
01:25:11,933 --> 01:25:13,367
The protection of your
house saved you from. .

1320
01:25:13,433 --> 01:25:16,035
. .the dirt in this world
but think about this.

1321
01:25:16,866 --> 01:25:22,071
If you were born near a gutter,
you wouldn't have parents.

1322
01:25:22,766 --> 01:25:23,800
You wouldn't have a family.

1323
01:25:24,466 --> 01:25:26,367
From your childhood, you would get. .

1324
01:25:26,399 --> 01:25:28,835
. .leftovers and abuses
from the people.

1325
01:25:29,566 --> 01:25:33,369
When you would grow and
before you turn into. .

1326
01:25:33,433 --> 01:25:36,102
. .a woman, you would
have been made a call girl.

1327
01:25:37,033 --> 01:25:40,102
Orphans like me would
ask about your cost.

1328
01:25:40,966 --> 01:25:42,500
They would play around
with your body.

1329
01:25:42,933 --> 01:25:45,402
They would call you immoral
and a call girl!

1330
01:25:45,533 --> 01:25:49,036
Shut up!
- Now you feel hurt.

1331
01:25:49,899 --> 01:25:52,369
Madam, don't say anything
against anyone. .

1332
01:25:52,433 --> 01:25:55,936
. .without knowing everything
about them.

1333
01:25:57,633 --> 01:26:01,003
God doesn't know who is responsible
for every crime.

1334
01:26:02,633 --> 01:26:06,303
If at this time, in
this dark corner. .

1335
01:26:06,366 --> 01:26:08,634
. .I would do something
wrong with you.

1336
01:26:09,699 --> 01:26:11,568
The world won't call
me as a criminal.

1337
01:26:12,399 --> 01:26:14,301
It will deem that orphan
as a criminal. .

1338
01:26:14,366 --> 01:26:18,970
. .whom you will throw away in
secret, just as I was thrown!

1339
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:24,469
Before the animal inside
me hurts you, go away.

1340
01:26:25,933 --> 01:26:27,000
Go away!

1341
01:26:27,899 --> 01:26:31,003
Heera, send these papers
to the lawyer.

1342
01:26:31,399 --> 01:26:32,834
Tell him that I want the copies
immediately. - Yes, sir.

1343
01:26:34,699 --> 01:26:37,702
Madhu, what is it?
Why are you crying?

1344
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:41,902
Father, today is a day for
a Rakhi (sacred thread).

1345
01:26:42,666 --> 01:26:44,300
Every brother goes
to his sister and. .

1346
01:26:44,366 --> 01:26:48,369
. .gets a Rakhi tied. He
blesses his sister.

1347
01:26:49,466 --> 01:26:54,704
My brother hasn't come yet
even though it's afternoon.

1348
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:58,569
Madhu, you act strangely.

1349
01:26:59,866 --> 01:27:02,635
You search for cold water
in a scorching desert.

1350
01:27:03,666 --> 01:27:06,235
Child, people who value
a Rakhi deem it. .

1351
01:27:06,266 --> 01:27:09,902
. .to be more valuable than
any amount of money.

1352
01:27:10,766 --> 01:27:12,234
For people like Mahinder, a Rakhi. .

1353
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:14,301
. .isn't a bond, it's a thread.

1354
01:27:15,233 --> 01:27:16,467
It isn't Rakhi, just ashes.

1355
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,768
Heera, explain it to Madhu.

1356
01:27:25,233 --> 01:27:26,734
Don't cry, Madhu.
Why are you crying?

1357
01:27:27,433 --> 01:27:30,502
I'll get Mahinder. I know
all his hangouts.

1358
01:27:31,566 --> 01:27:34,635
I am a servant of this house.
I will never let you cry.

1359
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:36,767
Are you telling the truth?
- Yes, I am.

1360
01:27:36,866 --> 01:27:39,235
I swear.
- Whom do you swear by?

1361
01:27:41,333 --> 01:27:43,468
Whom should I swear by?
I don't have anyone.

1362
01:27:44,333 --> 01:27:47,402
No relatives whom I can swear by.

1363
01:28:00,166 --> 01:28:02,635
What are you doing, Madhu?

1364
01:28:04,666 --> 01:28:07,368
I'm tying a Rakhi to my brother.

1365
01:28:17,166 --> 01:28:21,169
No, Madhu. I am not worth this.

1366
01:28:22,899 --> 01:28:24,635
You have made me a brother.

1367
01:28:25,633 --> 01:28:29,636
I am a man who has been
thrown away and rejected.

1368
01:28:30,733 --> 01:28:32,901
I have never felt any relation
throughout my life.

1369
01:28:34,433 --> 01:28:38,370
I am dirty, Madhu. Just
to be kicked around.

1370
01:28:39,266 --> 01:28:41,401
No! You are my brother.

1371
01:28:42,166 --> 01:28:45,802
If someone kicks you,
I'll cut his legs!

1372
01:28:46,566 --> 01:28:48,200
I am your sister, right?

1373
01:28:51,166 --> 01:28:57,105
Son, till yesterday you
had no one in this world.

1374
01:28:58,166 --> 01:29:03,170
Today, you have a sister
and a father.

1375
01:29:06,433 --> 01:29:12,172
Sir, the fires of life had
burned me and wounded me.

1376
01:29:13,166 --> 01:29:16,102
Your love has healed my wounds and. .

1377
01:29:16,133 --> 01:29:18,802
. .caused me to weep, sir.

1378
01:29:20,199 --> 01:29:22,802
I can't determine whether
this is a dream or reality.

1379
01:29:23,466 --> 01:29:27,403
If it is true, what was that
which I saw till today?

1380
01:29:28,266 --> 01:29:30,101
If it is a dream, may God cause. .

1381
01:29:30,166 --> 01:29:32,434
. .my eyes never to be opened, sir.

1382
01:29:33,166 --> 01:29:35,735
Not 'sir#  Call him
as father, brother.

1383
01:29:37,166 --> 01:29:38,500
Father!
- Madhu !

1384
01:29:39,266 --> 01:29:42,435
Where are you? Tie a
Rakhi quickly. Hurry!

1385
01:29:44,433 --> 01:29:45,767
Mahinder.
- Yes, father.

1386
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:51,237
These are the bonds of love.
They don't wait.

1387
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:54,102
The one, who was destined
to have it, got it.

1388
01:30:00,466 --> 01:30:03,268
Father, I don't like all this.

1389
01:30:04,233 --> 01:30:08,370
Heera, I called you here for work
not for making relations.

1390
01:30:09,233 --> 01:30:11,635
Don't step into the house
unless you are called.

1391
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:13,167
Understand?

1392
01:30:48,166 --> 01:30:51,335
Greetings, lawyer.
- You?

1393
01:30:51,433 --> 01:30:53,535
I'm Heera. I have been
sent by Mr. Kumar.

1394
01:30:53,666 --> 01:30:57,169
Ok! - He has asked for
these papers urgently.

1395
01:31:02,766 --> 01:31:06,603
Well, I may need a hour
or so to prepare them.

1396
01:31:06,666 --> 01:31:07,733
That's alright.

1397
01:31:09,133 --> 01:31:10,701
Go roam around till then.

1398
01:31:11,133 --> 01:31:13,034
Where can I go, sir? Your
Iand is so small that. .

1399
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:15,135
. .in five minutes I
can go around thrice.

1400
01:31:15,633 --> 01:31:18,168
I'll sit here.
- Alright then.

1401
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:20,735
Ms. Saxena! Read these papers.

1402
01:31:25,566 --> 01:31:30,771
Brother, I apologize. I think
I have met you before.

1403
01:31:32,033 --> 01:31:34,335
Are you fond of green pepper?

1404
01:31:37,033 --> 01:31:38,334
You are upset?

1405
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:47,669
Oh my! It's my enemy's house!

1406
01:31:50,033 --> 01:31:52,068
Oh my! -Listen!
- Yes.

1407
01:31:53,033 --> 01:31:56,603
Where are you going?
- Well.. I'm leaving.

1408
01:31:56,666 --> 01:31:58,968
What happened? You just
said you would sit.

1409
01:31:59,033 --> 01:32:00,267
Now you say you want
to leave. What is it?

1410
01:32:00,333 --> 01:32:01,534
I don't have any problem
in sitting here.

1411
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,969
The problem is that
I had a wrong number.

1412
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:07,069
Wrong number?
- Yes. I'm leaving.

1413
01:32:07,166 --> 01:32:09,601
Listen to me. Tell me
what the matter is.

1414
01:32:09,966 --> 01:32:13,135
What is it? What can it be?

1415
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:16,136
Actually, she spoke roughly.
I spoke straight away.

1416
01:32:16,199 --> 01:32:17,301
That is why, we had a problem.

1417
01:32:17,366 --> 01:32:19,234
That is why I am leaving.
- Listen!

1418
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:21,502
She was wrong, you were right.

1419
01:32:21,566 --> 01:32:23,968
Speak properly, why are you
beating around the bush?

1420
01:32:24,033 --> 01:32:26,101
This is it. That's it, lawyer.

1421
01:32:26,333 --> 01:32:27,967
I have just found out that
the world is round.

1422
01:32:28,033 --> 01:32:30,502
That is why I am leaving.
- Where to?

1423
01:32:32,133 --> 01:32:33,200
To move around.

1424
01:32:33,266 --> 01:32:35,401
Your papers are getting ready.
Take them along.

1425
01:32:35,466 --> 01:32:36,967
Sir, send them anytime.

1426
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,368
Otherwise, I'll see a good
chance and come again.

1427
01:32:38,466 --> 01:32:39,500
For the time being, I'm leaving.

1428
01:32:40,966 --> 01:32:42,033
You?
- You !

1429
01:32:43,033 --> 01:32:45,235
I have explained everything to him.

1430
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:46,634
That is why, I'm leaving.

1431
01:32:47,633 --> 01:32:49,234
How can you just go away?

1432
01:32:49,366 --> 01:32:50,433
How should I leave then?

1433
01:32:51,466 --> 01:32:53,668
I was searching for you.
Come with me.

1434
01:32:54,566 --> 01:32:55,566
Heera, you are doomed.

1435
01:32:59,233 --> 01:33:00,467
What happened? Come.

1436
01:33:04,399 --> 01:33:07,269
Your words shook my entire life.

1437
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:11,870
A big incident, perhaps
the biggest of my life. .

1438
01:33:11,933 --> 01:33:13,601
. .was reminded to me by your words.

1439
01:33:14,533 --> 01:33:15,600
Which incident?

1440
01:33:17,566 --> 01:33:21,937
I was a child. A boy used to
work at my grandma's house.

1441
01:33:23,300 --> 01:33:24,901
He would wash our utensils.

1442
01:33:25,566 --> 01:33:26,867
He knew many languages.

1443
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,435
Hindi, English, Urdu, Marathi,
Gujarati, Punjabi. .

1444
01:33:30,033 --> 01:33:31,334
He would speak them very easily.

1445
01:33:31,933 --> 01:33:33,100
His father was a drunkard.

1446
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,369
His father would drink
and beat him up.

1447
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:39,436
Yes. He would even take
away his salary.

1448
01:33:40,399 --> 01:33:42,268
One day, my professor asked me.

1449
01:33:42,866 --> 01:33:44,567
How many years was Ram exiled for?

1450
01:33:44,866 --> 01:33:48,302
You couldn't answer. So
the boy said, 14 years.

1451
01:33:48,366 --> 01:33:51,469
Yes. Then, I gave
him a book to read.

1452
01:33:52,033 --> 01:33:53,434
His father took it away.

1453
01:33:54,566 --> 01:33:57,101
He hit him so much that he never
returned to your house.

1454
01:33:57,433 --> 01:34:03,305
Yes! How do you know all this?

1455
01:34:03,866 --> 01:34:05,100
Do you want to meet that boy?

1456
01:34:05,233 --> 01:34:09,303
Do you know him?
- He has been with me since birth.

1457
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:12,235
Where is here? Take me to him.

1458
01:34:13,433 --> 01:34:17,036
He's very poor. He stays in a hut.

1459
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:21,037
I don't care. Wherever he may
be, please take me to him.

1460
01:34:22,866 --> 01:34:23,933
Come along.

1461
01:34:28,466 --> 01:34:31,235
This place is to dark.
I can't see anything.

1462
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:33,201
I told you that he is very poor.

1463
01:34:34,199 --> 01:34:36,435
Poor people only have darkness
for themselves.

1464
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:38,867
Come along.

1465
01:34:54,166 --> 01:34:56,434
Where is he?
- I'll show you.

1466
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:10,401
Is that him?

1467
01:35:22,366 --> 01:35:27,471
This is the same book
but where is he?

1468
01:35:28,066 --> 01:35:32,270
You recognised the
book that you gave.

1469
01:35:33,266 --> 01:35:34,400
You couldn't recognise the person.

1470
01:35:39,333 --> 01:35:42,736
Take it. I'll tell grandma
and order another book.

1471
01:35:48,399 --> 01:35:52,270
You!
- Yes.

1472
01:36:06,033 --> 01:36:10,804
''We were separated
from a long time. ''

1473
01:36:11,666 --> 01:36:20,841
''Now we meet each other.''

1474
01:36:21,833 --> 01:36:30,675
''Like a fire burning through. .

1475
01:36:30,733 --> 01:36:37,840
. .a single flame.''

1476
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:14,603
''We were separated
from a long time. ''

1477
01:37:14,666 --> 01:37:21,706
''Now we meet each other.''

1478
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:26,604
''Like the monsoons. .''

1479
01:37:26,933 --> 01:37:37,209
''Like rains that fall
during the monsoons.''

1480
01:37:37,266 --> 01:37:41,203
''We were separated
from a long time. ''

1481
01:37:41,266 --> 01:37:47,705
''Now we meet each other.''

1482
01:37:47,766 --> 01:37:52,904
''We were separated for a long time.''

1483
01:38:12,866 --> 01:38:18,004
''After a long time, there
is a fragrance.''

1484
01:38:18,066 --> 01:38:22,870
''The heart beats, the breath flows.''

1485
01:38:23,066 --> 01:38:28,137
''Love has been formed
through thirsty eyes.''

1486
01:38:28,233 --> 01:38:33,071
''From soft lips, there is a fire.''

1487
01:38:39,066 --> 01:38:41,735
''The scented breeze and wind. .''

1488
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:43,835
''It has made two thirsty
hearts meet.''

1489
01:38:44,133 --> 01:38:46,768
''It has made two thirsty
hearts meet.''

1490
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:53,138
''Just like intoxication.. ''

1491
01:38:53,533 --> 01:39:03,509
''Just as intoxication enters
a drunk as he stumbles. ''

1492
01:39:03,566 --> 01:39:07,469
''We were separated
from a long time. ''

1493
01:39:07,533 --> 01:39:13,772
''Now we meet each other.''

1494
01:39:13,833 --> 01:39:18,971
''We were separated for a long time.''

1495
01:39:41,933 --> 01:39:49,106
''The wedding trumpet sings
a song far away. ''

1496
01:39:51,666 --> 01:39:56,570
''It touches the cords
of our hearts. ''

1497
01:39:56,699 --> 01:40:01,771
''It touches the cords
of our hearts. ''

1498
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:09,673
''Flowers of our dreams
blossom here. ''

1499
01:40:09,733 --> 01:40:14,537
''Prayers of the heart
are fulfilled. ''

1500
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:19,638
''Prayers of the heart
are fulfilled. ''

1501
01:40:25,399 --> 01:40:27,935
''We were strangers for years.
We were alone. ''

1502
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,402
''Strangers met in such a way.''

1503
01:40:30,533 --> 01:40:33,035
''Strangers met in such a way.''

1504
01:40:34,399 --> 01:40:37,002
''As we wished for. .''

1505
01:40:37,033 --> 01:40:39,435
''As we wished for. .''

1506
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:49,643
''As our prayers are fulfilled
after being tested. ''

1507
01:40:49,766 --> 01:40:53,002
''We were separated
from a long time. ''

1508
01:40:53,066 --> 01:40:59,872
''Now we meet each other.''

1509
01:40:59,933 --> 01:41:10,343
''Like rains that fall
during the monsoons.''

1510
01:41:10,366 --> 01:41:13,535
''We were separated
from a long time. ''

1511
01:41:13,566 --> 01:41:20,439
''Now we meet each other.''

1512
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:25,671
''We were separated
from a long time. ''

1513
01:41:48,633 --> 01:41:51,469
Where are you going, darling?
- To hell! What do you care?

1514
01:41:52,333 --> 01:41:55,969
I care just about you.
I will go where you go.

1515
01:41:57,800 --> 01:41:59,568
That day you were talking
about a relation.

1516
01:41:59,633 --> 01:42:02,602
I was in a hurry. Let's have
our relation made today.

1517
01:42:04,399 --> 01:42:05,934
You idiot, leave me!

1518
01:42:06,266 --> 01:42:07,333
Brother!

1519
01:42:09,366 --> 01:42:11,668
Why are you troubling
your brother, beloved?

1520
01:42:11,933 --> 01:42:14,535
I am talking about a relation..
- Brother!

1521
01:42:17,866 --> 01:42:20,268
Save me! Brother!

Get him!

1538
01:44:41,300 --> 01:44:45,203
You thugs! If you dare
to move ahead. .

1539
01:44:45,266 --> 01:44:46,467

1540
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:49,335

poor people done to you?

r
If this wood-house is burned
their kids will perish!

1548

Ram Singh! If you want Mahinder,
I'll get him.

1549
01:45:17,199 --> 01:45:18,601
Don't do this, Ram Singh!

1550
01:45:18,666 --> 01:45:25,272

What happened to my hands?

1561
01:46:23,433 --> 01:46:27,236

Mohini? How did you come
here at this time?

1594
01:51:28,366 --> 01:51:29,767
At least you recognised me.

1595
01:51:30,300 --> 01:51:31,734
I thought for Ram Singh
you would forget. .

1596
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:34,035
. .me along with the
rest of the world.

1597
01:51:35,033 --> 01:51:36,334
How can I forget you?

1598
01:51:37,466 --> 01:51:40,268
Anyone who sees you once
won't forget you.

1599
01:51:40,333 --> 01:51:41,734
I see you all the time.

1600
01:51:41,866 --> 01:51:44,835
That's enough! Why didn't
you meet me all this time?

1601
01:51:45,233 --> 01:51:47,435
The world extends beyond Ram Singh.

1602
01:51:47,533 --> 01:51:50,269
It does. It's a beautiful world.

1603
01:51:51,233 --> 01:51:55,270
However, now my world will start
from here and end here.

1604
01:51:56,066 --> 01:51:57,233
What about me?

1605
01:51:58,966 --> 01:52:03,270
We will be there for
each other. Get it?

1606
01:52:03,333 --> 01:52:04,867
No. I didn't understand.

1607
01:52:05,333 --> 01:52:08,869
I knew you wouldn't. You
will find out. Come.

1608
01:52:09,199 --> 01:52:10,668
Where?
- We have to buy some things. .

1609
01:52:10,733 --> 01:52:12,134
. .for Ram Singh from town.

1610
01:52:12,666 --> 01:52:13,900
Tell me. I'll get it.

1611
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:17,068
Ram Singh's house's responsibility
is mine.

1612
01:52:17,399 --> 01:52:21,971
That is my duty. A man
should do his duty.

1613
01:52:22,966 --> 01:52:24,033
Come.

1614
01:52:24,100 --> 01:52:27,102
Sir! You are with a girl again?

1615
01:52:27,166 --> 01:52:30,002
I have been searching for
you since many days!

1616
01:52:30,066 --> 01:52:32,368
I didn't find you at the doctor's
house or wood-house.

1617
01:52:32,433 --> 01:52:34,668
I find you here at this
rotten man's house.

1618
01:52:34,733 --> 01:52:37,368
Understand?
- I have understood.

1619
01:52:37,433 --> 01:52:39,201
I think I'll have to
make you understand.

1620
01:52:39,266 --> 01:52:40,333
What do you mean?

1621
01:52:40,399 --> 01:52:44,670
I mean that if you ever speak
badly about Ram Singh. .

1622
01:52:44,733 --> 01:52:48,103
. .again, I'll make your
other eye flap too.

1623
01:52:49,066 --> 01:52:51,268
Forget about me. Take
care of yourself.

1624
01:52:51,866 --> 01:52:52,967
Should I tell you a secret?

1625
01:52:53,666 --> 01:52:55,200
Mahinder is very angry with you.

1626
01:52:55,266 --> 01:52:57,001
You haven't come for
work since many days.

1627
01:52:57,066 --> 01:52:58,700
He has called you immediately.
Come with me!

1628
01:53:01,366 --> 01:53:03,201
Listen to me.
- Yes.

1629
01:53:03,899 --> 01:53:06,969
Tell Mahinder that I
have quit his job.

1630
01:53:07,666 --> 01:53:10,668
Also tell him that if
he ever looks at. .

1631
01:53:10,733 --> 01:53:12,668
.. Ram Singh or his sister again. .

1632
01:53:12,733 --> 01:53:17,204
. .I'll make him stand on a
road and burn him to death!

1633
01:53:17,666 --> 01:53:18,733
Get lost!

1634
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,067
Tell me!

1635
01:53:22,399 --> 01:53:24,101
You dishonest man! Where is Heera?

1636
01:53:26,666 --> 01:53:30,036
You still have your old fervor.

1637
01:53:31,666 --> 01:53:36,337
You idiot, you feel
secured due to Heera.

1638
01:53:36,666 --> 01:53:38,701
I asked you where
he is. Where is he?

1639
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:42,303
I won't tell you.
- I will make you tell me.

1640
01:53:42,833 --> 01:53:43,900
Tell me!

1641
01:53:45,300 --> 01:53:48,770
Get up. Now tell me where Heera is.

1642
01:53:48,966 --> 01:53:50,033
I won't tell you.

1643
01:53:53,833 --> 01:53:58,704
Tell me! You won't tell me? Tell me!

1644
01:54:05,233 --> 01:54:12,139
Now tell me. - Till I remain
alive, I won't speak.

1645
01:54:12,266 --> 01:54:13,834
You won't tell me?
- I won't tell you.

1646
01:54:14,033 --> 01:54:18,837
Bhima, beat him up.

1647
01:54:21,066 --> 01:54:22,200
Brother!

You idiots, leave my brother!
- Leave him!

1650

You coward! If you want
to take revenge. .

. .take it from me. Why
do you attack him?

1652
01:54:37,066 --> 01:54:40,836
Bhima, hurt him more.

1653
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,802
Leave my brother. I beg of you!

1654
01:54:45,300 --> 01:54:49,170
Don't beg for your brother!

1655
01:54:49,300 --> 01:54:51,602

Don't beg before that idiot!

1659
01:55:00,533 --> 01:55:03,669
If I listen to you, will
you spare my brother.

1660
01:55:03,733 --> 01:55:05,534
No, Channo!
- Certainly.

1661

Don't worry about me.
- Promise. I'll leave him.

1662

Mahinder!

1692
01:58:25,833 --> 01:58:26,934
Doctor, you are still here?

1693
01:58:26,966 --> 01:58:28,467
You have been called for
at the police station.

1694
01:58:28,533 --> 01:58:30,735
Quickly! Come along, come!

1695
01:58:34,333 --> 01:58:38,070
Don't worry. Don't be worried.
I'm coming.

1696
01:58:41,866 --> 01:58:45,903
Father?
- What is it, son?

1697
01:58:46,666 --> 01:58:49,402
Nothing.
- Whom were you talking to?

1698
01:58:49,466 --> 01:58:52,335
It was the lawyer.
- Why?

1699
01:58:53,566 --> 01:58:57,870
Father, Ram Singh the
potter has been killed.

1700
01:58:58,266 --> 01:59:03,270
How? - Our manager Heera
had an affair with. .

1701
01:59:03,333 --> 01:59:05,268
.. Ram Singh's sister Channo.

1702
01:59:05,899 --> 01:59:07,468
She was pregnant with his child.

1703
01:59:07,966 --> 01:59:11,903
When she told Heera to get
married, he refused.

1704
01:59:11,966 --> 01:59:13,701
He's lying, father! He's lying!

1705
01:59:16,633 --> 01:59:17,700
What is this I hear, son?

1706
01:59:17,866 --> 01:59:19,667
You haven't done anything
other than hearing.

1707
01:59:20,366 --> 01:59:21,934
You keep sitting here.

1708
01:59:22,333 --> 01:59:25,369
You have left this devil to play
around with helpless people.

1709
01:59:25,433 --> 01:59:28,569
Speak properly! Who are you
to call my son a devil?

1710
01:59:28,600 --> 01:59:29,701
He is not only a devil, mother.

1711
01:59:29,899 --> 01:59:30,967
He's worse than a demon.

1712
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,302
You don't believe because
he is your son, your own.

1713
01:59:33,466 --> 01:59:35,734
Come with me. I'll show
you his reality.

1714
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:36,867
Shut up, discourteous man!

1715
01:59:37,433 --> 01:59:39,401
You want to blame your crime
on me and save yourself?

1716
01:59:39,466 --> 01:59:40,533
Mahinder!
- Heera.

1717
01:59:42,500 --> 01:59:46,537
I'll see what the truth is and
what is false on my own.

1718
01:59:46,933 --> 01:59:48,000
Then, I will decide.

1719
01:59:48,066 --> 01:59:49,267
Fire! Fire!

1720
02:00:04,433 --> 02:00:06,835
Leave me. Leave me!

1721
02:00:06,899 --> 02:00:09,369
Heera, don't pretend.

1722
02:00:09,433 --> 02:00:11,401
You killed them both and
set their house on fire.

1723
02:00:11,466 --> 02:00:13,868
Accountant! You're lying!

1724
02:00:13,933 --> 02:00:16,468
You may say that he's lying.

1725
02:00:16,533 --> 02:00:18,201
How can you say that the
slum dwellers are lying?

1726
02:00:18,266 --> 02:00:20,201
Before them you killed them both. .

1727
02:00:20,266 --> 02:00:21,333
. .and set their house on fire!

1728
02:00:21,399 --> 02:00:25,203
Shut up, you liar!
- Come, inspector. Come.

1729
02:00:25,433 --> 02:00:27,468
Inspector, he's the killer.

1730
02:00:27,600 --> 02:00:29,201
He has killed Ram Singh
and his sister.

1731
02:00:29,266 --> 02:00:31,201
Then he set fire to
their house. Get him.

1732
02:00:31,266 --> 02:00:35,837
You greedy dog! You sell
yourself for money!

1733
02:00:35,899 --> 02:00:38,435
I am not the killer. It's him,
your provider. Mahinder!

1734
02:00:38,500 --> 02:00:41,436
Arrest him.
- Hold your tongue.

1735
02:00:42,199 --> 02:00:43,868
Father, did you see?

1736
02:00:44,333 --> 02:00:47,836
I was under control till now,
sir. I really was!

1737
02:00:48,366 --> 02:00:52,536
I saw your fake refinement
and tried to be civilized.

1738
02:00:53,199 --> 02:00:54,568
I became a better man.

1739
02:00:54,633 --> 02:00:58,136
You people who are called
civilized are still rotten!

1740
02:00:58,199 --> 02:00:59,267
Shut up, fool!

1741
02:00:59,333 --> 02:01:01,301
You are a fool and
so is your father!

1742
02:01:01,366 --> 02:01:03,134
What are you staring at inspector?
Arrest him.

1743
02:01:20,866 --> 02:01:25,136
Sir, I swear by God.

1744
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:30,136
The day I am released,
I will hurt you. .

1745
02:01:30,199 --> 02:01:34,504
..in such a way as
Ram Singh was hurt.

1746
02:01:36,133 --> 02:01:37,300
I swear by God!

1747
02:01:55,133 --> 02:01:59,070
Due to witnesses borne
by doctor Goyal and. .

1748
02:01:59,133 --> 02:02:02,302
.. Ms. Mohini, the court has decided
Mr. Heera is innocent.

1749
02:02:02,566 --> 02:02:06,069
The court releases Mr. Heera
and orders the police. .

1750
02:02:06,133 --> 02:02:11,204
. .to quickly try to and
arrest the real culprits.

1751
02:02:35,666 --> 02:02:38,735
Do you recognise this?
- Yes.

1752
02:02:39,466 --> 02:02:42,502
I gave you this return ticket.

1753
02:02:42,566 --> 02:02:45,769
If you wouldn't like my business
you could return.

1754
02:02:46,600 --> 02:02:48,168
Now you should return.

1755
02:02:50,399 --> 02:02:53,770
No, Mahinder. There is no way,
I'm going to return.

1756
02:02:54,399 --> 02:02:58,070
I liked the business. I
didn't like a few people.

1757
02:02:58,600 --> 02:03:00,735
I don't take much time to
correct wrong people.

1758
02:03:02,199 --> 02:03:04,602
I'll snap my fingers and
the person is cleared.

1759
02:03:05,666 --> 02:03:11,104
No, this isn't so easy. This
isn't Mumbai. It's my town.

1760
02:03:12,066 --> 02:03:14,535
Even a dog acts like a lion
in his territory, Mahinder.

1761
02:03:15,066 --> 02:03:17,802
Anyway, I have always seen
only dogs that bark.

1762
02:03:18,566 --> 02:03:23,470
Some dogs just bite.
They don't bark.

1763
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:24,667
My name is Heera (a diamond).

1764
02:03:25,600 --> 02:03:28,235
If I am embraced
I become jewellery'.

1765
02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:35,072
If I am pulled roughly,
I can cut you down.

1766
02:03:41,233 --> 02:03:43,468
That idiot has challenged me.

1767
02:03:44,333 --> 02:03:45,434
He will surely come here.

1768
02:03:46,666 --> 02:03:48,534
This is the only way to come in.

1769
02:03:49,399 --> 02:03:54,138
Kill him and properly
dispose off his body.

1770
02:03:54,233 --> 02:03:55,534
I'll make you rich.

1771
02:03:56,433 --> 02:03:59,135
Remember that none of
you must be recognised.

1772
02:03:59,699 --> 02:04:03,737
The villagers should think
that he has fled.

1773
02:04:04,399 --> 02:04:06,135
Understand? Yes!

1774
02:04:07,366 --> 02:04:09,000
Don't let father know about this.

1775
02:04:09,066 --> 02:04:10,600
He won't know. Don't worry.

1776
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:12,568
Otherwise I'll kill you too.

1777
02:04:26,133 --> 02:04:27,501
Alright, hurry up!

1778
02:04:28,600 --> 02:04:31,336
I'll blow up his brains.

1779
02:04:31,399 --> 02:04:34,002
When you shoot him, take
a small reward from me.

1780
02:04:34,066 --> 02:04:35,167
Go on now! Get lost.

1781
02:05:09,933 --> 02:05:11,134
O God.

1782
02:05:19,133 --> 02:05:20,534
Hail Lord Hanuman!

1783
02:05:25,466 --> 02:05:26,533
Hey you!

1784
02:05:52,199 --> 02:05:55,136
Look at his face. He
was going to kill me.

1785
02:06:04,199 --> 02:06:05,868
Brother, tell me, what
shall I do to you.

1786
02:06:06,166 --> 02:06:07,467
Forgive me, brother.

1787
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:32,271
God, they are the people who
sent me with a bulldozer.

1788
02:07:33,066 --> 02:07:34,400
They told me to destroy the slum.

1789
02:07:34,899 --> 02:07:38,803
Remove the temple. Poor
people stay for free.

1790
02:07:39,033 --> 02:07:41,235
God doesn't pay rent
too. Remove him.

1791
02:07:42,300 --> 02:07:46,971
Look at me. You hurt
me many times, son.

1792
02:07:47,033 --> 02:07:48,100
I never complained.

1793
02:07:48,399 --> 02:07:51,202
Remember? That day,
I used a bulldozer.

1794
02:07:51,300 --> 02:07:52,334
I didn't let you be harmed.

1795
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:54,934
What are you doing? Put that down.

1796
02:07:56,033 --> 02:07:59,102
When two elders speak, you
shouldn't intervene.

1797
02:07:59,333 --> 02:08:00,400
Understand?

1798
02:08:04,433 --> 02:08:06,168
You have made strange models, Lord.

1799
02:08:07,233 --> 02:08:08,334
It's good that their number is few.

1800
02:08:08,899 --> 02:08:11,836
If it were more you would
be completely cleared off!

1801
02:08:15,100 --> 02:08:16,901
Look at this. Another model.

1802
02:08:17,266 --> 02:08:19,735
Harzana! Come here, you idiot.

1803
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:24,971
Yes. - Come here.
- Don't hit me, sir.

1804
02:08:25,333 --> 02:08:27,234
You were hitting the others
but I was getting wounded.

1805
02:08:27,733 --> 02:08:29,734
If you hit me, my sisters
and mother will die.

1806
02:08:29,800 --> 02:08:30,867
Do you have sisters and a mother?

1807
02:08:30,933 --> 02:08:32,367
Yes. Two unmarried mothers
and a sister.

1808
02:08:33,300 --> 02:08:35,468
No! A mother and two
unmarried sisters.

1809
02:08:35,533 --> 02:08:37,735
Still you wink at girls?

1810
02:08:38,066 --> 02:08:40,735
Sir, if I don't work
for a bad employer. .

1811
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:42,935
..how will I feed my
sisters and mother?

1812
02:08:43,100 --> 02:08:44,334
Look, fool.
- Yes.

1813
02:08:44,733 --> 02:08:46,334
I'll spare you only
on one condition.

1814
02:08:46,399 --> 02:08:47,467
Order me, sir.

1815
02:08:47,933 --> 02:08:50,869
After today, you won't wink.
- I'll stop it.

1816
02:08:51,333 --> 02:08:52,801
Wrong deeds..
- Stopped.

1817
02:08:53,233 --> 02:08:54,901
Honestly..
- Stopped.

1818
02:08:56,199 --> 02:08:57,267
I'll be honest!

1819
02:08:57,666 --> 02:08:58,767
Did you get me?
- I did.

1820
02:08:58,800 --> 02:08:59,867
Go! Get lost!

1821
02:09:01,100 --> 02:09:02,668
Alright, I'm leaving.
- ok.

1822
02:09:02,866 --> 02:09:04,267
Greetings.
- Greetings. - Bye.

1823
02:09:06,666 --> 02:09:09,402
Greetings, sir.
- Who are you?

1824
02:09:10,966 --> 02:09:13,902
Sir, have you forgotten
Gangu Ganpat?

1825
02:09:16,266 --> 02:09:18,368
It appears you have forgotten
your old story, sir.

1826
02:09:18,433 --> 02:09:19,901
I'll have to narrate
it in its entirety.

1827
02:09:20,333 --> 02:09:21,400
Do you remember, sir?

1828
02:09:21,466 --> 02:09:24,802
You had a friend's sister
at your home, Vidya.

1829
02:09:24,866 --> 02:09:26,934
She had a child.
- Yes! Gangu!

1830
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,769
Yes.
- That's you ! - Yes, me.

1831
02:09:29,899 --> 02:09:31,768
You remembered me only because
I told you the story.

1832
02:09:32,066 --> 02:09:34,034
Alright, do something.
Move sideways.

1833
02:09:34,100 --> 02:09:36,068
No, sir. Sit back.

1834
02:09:36,133 --> 02:09:38,802
I am your old driver. I have
taken my former position.

1835
02:09:38,866 --> 02:09:40,834
No, it's alright. I'll
drive. Sit there.

1836
02:09:40,899 --> 02:09:41,967
Come.
- o k.

1837
02:09:50,266 --> 02:09:53,002
Get off.
- Is this your house, sir?

1838
02:09:53,333 --> 02:09:57,970
First get off the car.
- I'm off, sir.

1839
02:09:58,033 --> 02:09:59,100
Shut the door properly.

1840
02:09:59,166 --> 02:10:02,202
Yes.. why did you stop
sending money, sir?

1841
02:10:03,033 --> 02:10:06,903
Take 500 rupees. Get a ticket
and go to Mumbai.

1842
02:10:07,966 --> 02:10:11,602
If I see you again, I'll send
you to jail for so long. .

1843
02:10:11,666 --> 02:10:13,701
. .that you'll go in alive
and come out dead.

1844
02:10:14,166 --> 02:10:15,967
Remember that my name
is Kailashnath.

1845
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:23,869
I remember that your
name is Kailashnath.

1846
02:10:24,733 --> 02:10:27,969
You can't send me to jail, you fool.

1847
02:10:28,733 --> 02:10:30,901
You committed a sin and
I should go to jail?

1848
02:10:31,766 --> 02:10:34,935
You threaten me because I'm old?

1849
02:10:36,600 --> 02:10:40,103
I swear, I'll show you, you fool!

1850
02:10:40,733 --> 02:10:42,034
What do you mean?
- Meaning?

1851
02:10:42,199 --> 02:10:44,902
You have borne witness against
Mahinder in the court.

1852
02:10:45,066 --> 02:10:47,001
So, we will decide this.

1853
02:10:47,266 --> 02:10:49,201
Whatever I said in court,
was the truth.

1854
02:10:49,266 --> 02:10:50,600
Is speaking the truth a sin?

1855
02:10:50,666 --> 02:10:52,768
It's not a sin but it is wrong.

1856
02:10:53,333 --> 02:10:54,867
What are you doing?
- Go on.

1857
02:10:54,933 --> 02:10:56,868
Show the doctor around the market.

1858
02:10:56,933 --> 02:10:58,868
So that the others too may see that.

1859
02:11:21,199 --> 02:11:22,734
Kumar Ranvir Singh.

1860
02:11:23,899 --> 02:11:24,967
Who are you?

1861
02:11:25,533 --> 02:11:28,135
Kailashnath's old driver, Gangu?

1862
02:11:29,199 --> 02:11:30,267
Gangu?
- Yes.

1863
02:11:31,266 --> 02:11:34,736
Are you Gangu?
- Do you know me?

1864
02:11:35,266 --> 02:11:36,634
You are Heera's father, right?

1865
02:11:36,866 --> 02:11:38,033
You would squander his earnings. .

1866
02:11:38,100 --> 02:11:39,234
. .in liquor during his childhood.

1867
02:11:39,300 --> 02:11:43,671
Forget it, madam. You know
that liquor ruins a man.

1868
02:11:44,233 --> 02:11:47,703
Heera left me and came here.

1869
02:11:48,100 --> 02:11:50,735
Heera says that he has no relative.

1870
02:11:51,166 --> 02:11:53,768
No, madam! He has everything.

1871
02:11:54,466 --> 02:11:56,534
He should be in a big house.

1872
02:11:57,666 --> 02:12:01,169
This lousy Kailashnath!
- Speak carefully.

1873
02:12:01,800 --> 02:12:02,867
He is my father.

1874
02:12:05,600 --> 02:12:08,002
How was a good girl like
you born at his house?

1875
02:12:08,766 --> 02:12:10,601
Alright! You are his daughter,
aren't you?

1876
02:12:10,666 --> 02:12:14,469
I'll tell you everything.
Your father is very bad.

1877
02:12:14,500 --> 02:12:16,501
He made Heera an orphan.

1878
02:12:17,899 --> 02:12:20,836
Madam, I haven't eaten
anything in two days.

1879
02:12:21,800 --> 02:12:24,068
I haven't taken a drink either.
Will I get some money?

1880
02:12:24,766 --> 02:12:27,201
I'll give you as much as you
want. Tell me everything.

1881
02:12:29,800 --> 02:12:30,867
Doctor!

1882
02:12:33,600 --> 02:12:34,667
Doctor.

1883
02:12:36,633 --> 02:12:39,869
How did all this happen?
- It's nothing, son.

1884
02:12:41,033 --> 02:12:42,100
There was a premonition.

1885
02:12:42,733 --> 02:12:46,603
A storm came and destroyed
everything.

1886
02:12:47,199 --> 02:12:49,769
How did the storm
destroy only your place?

1887
02:12:53,633 --> 02:12:55,034
Oh! I understand.

1888
02:12:56,766 --> 02:12:59,468
From my childhood, day and night. .

1889
02:12:59,533 --> 02:13:02,469
. .I have faced such storms.

1890
02:13:04,033 --> 02:13:07,102
They think that they have
the law under control.

1891
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:11,837
No, son. No.
- Don't worry, doctor.

1892
02:13:13,466 --> 02:13:16,769
I have been practicing for
this match for twenty-five years.

1893
02:13:17,733 --> 02:13:20,068
The only thing different
are these clothes.

1894
02:13:21,899 --> 02:13:23,801
Now my clothes and speech
have been changed.

1895
02:13:24,566 --> 02:13:25,900
I will have to come back to reality.

1896
02:13:49,533 --> 02:13:50,600
What is this son?

1897
02:13:52,466 --> 02:13:54,401
Doctor, I have played every match. .

1898
02:13:54,433 --> 02:13:55,534
. .of my life wearing this uniform.

1899
02:13:56,399 --> 02:14:00,403
There was a short interval
but the match resumes now.

1900
02:14:03,666 --> 02:14:09,471
Take this, doctor. This is
my shroud. A black shroud.

1901
02:14:10,133 --> 02:14:13,569
If something happens to
me, put it over me.

1902
02:14:19,800 --> 02:14:22,469
Now no one will bear witness
against Mahinder.

1903
02:14:28,433 --> 02:14:31,102
What is it? You attacked the doctor.

1904
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:33,401
I'll beat you up in
such a way that no. .

1905
02:14:33,466 --> 02:14:36,135
. .doctor in this world would
be able to treat you.

1906
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,702
Don't fight, please! Please don't!

1907
02:14:57,333 --> 02:14:59,001
Mahinder!

1908
02:15:06,033 --> 02:15:12,372
You coward! You rule over
your slaves! Come out!

1909
02:15:14,066 --> 02:15:18,336
In your village, in your colony,
before your house. .

1910
02:15:18,399 --> 02:15:22,337
.. Heera challenges you! Come out!

1911
02:15:23,333 --> 02:15:24,400
Why is he abusing you?

1912
02:15:24,466 --> 02:15:25,667
Why are you hiding inside?!
- He is a fool, mother.

1913
02:15:25,733 --> 02:15:28,001
Father has pampered him
a lot. Otherwise. .

1914
02:15:28,566 --> 02:15:33,470
Why do you attack an old
weak doctor, you idiot?

1915
02:15:34,333 --> 02:15:36,868
If you've got guts come before me!

1916
02:15:37,833 --> 02:15:42,003
I hurt you with just
one blow, you fool!

1917
02:15:43,966 --> 02:15:48,403
This man and his father
are looting the world.

1918
02:15:51,699 --> 02:15:54,269
The father gives donations,
creates orphanages. .

1919
02:15:54,333 --> 02:15:56,635
. .and tries to fool the public.

1920
02:15:57,766 --> 02:15:59,267
His son. .

1921
02:16:00,600 --> 02:16:04,904
He uses his men and acts
harshly against the poor.

1922
02:16:05,633 --> 02:16:06,700
Come out!

1923
02:16:07,666 --> 02:16:11,269
I ask you, if someone
abuses your God. .

1924
02:16:11,300 --> 02:16:15,804
r
. .if he is dishonoured
will you be quiet?

1925
02:16:15,866 --> 02:16:17,300
No!

1926
02:16:17,600 --> 02:16:22,271
Today that God is being
abused openly by. .

1927
02:16:22,333 --> 02:16:24,668
. .a disgusting man, a betrayer!

1928
02:16:24,766 --> 02:16:29,871
You rich people! Why do
you make fun of us poor?

1929
02:16:31,733 --> 02:16:32,800
Sometimes you treat me as your son.

1930
02:16:32,866 --> 02:16:35,268
Then you make me wear a Rakhi..
and treat me as your brother.

1931
02:16:36,399 --> 02:16:37,768
It's all for your selfishness.

1932
02:16:39,333 --> 02:16:41,401
Otherwise, this Rakhi
is nothing much.

1933
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:45,269
Even if a steel chain would
exist in it's place. .

1934
02:16:45,299 --> 02:16:49,337
. .you would still cut it with
the sword of your dishonesty.

1935
02:16:53,666 --> 02:16:55,467
Now no one is coming out.

1936
02:16:57,933 --> 02:17:00,302
Have you, father and son got scared?

1937
02:17:19,799 --> 02:17:23,236
Heera, speak with caution, or else. .

1938
02:17:23,766 --> 02:17:26,802
What will you do? Shoot me?

1939
02:17:26,866 --> 02:17:28,400
Yes, I will shoot you, Heera.

1940
02:17:28,600 --> 02:17:33,471
Here, shoot me. The world will
find the reality of this house.

1941
02:17:34,200 --> 02:17:36,535
They should know that
not only the son. .

1942
02:17:37,433 --> 02:17:42,604
Even a generous, religious,
the helper of the poor.

1943
02:17:43,266 --> 02:17:46,202
The provider of the helpless,
an image of God. .

1944
02:17:46,266 --> 02:17:51,504
.. Kunwar Ranvir Singh knows
to pick up a gun and shoot.

1945
02:17:52,200 --> 02:17:53,200
Shoot me.

1946
02:17:54,466 --> 02:17:57,202
No! No, father!

1947
02:17:58,600 --> 02:18:00,401
Wait, father. What are you doing?

1948
02:18:00,533 --> 02:18:02,868
Move back, Mohini! I'll kill him!

1949
02:18:02,933 --> 02:18:05,669
Don't do that. He has your blood.

1950
02:18:05,733 --> 02:18:06,800
He is your son!

1951
02:18:14,833 --> 02:18:17,135
Gangu, the driver has
told me everything.

1952
02:18:19,633 --> 02:18:20,667
Come in, father.

1953
02:18:21,633 --> 02:18:25,837
Sir! What happened?
Is that all you got?

1954
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:29,335
Are you chickening out? Shoot me!

1955
02:18:31,133 --> 02:18:34,269
Rich man! Where are you going?

1956
02:18:39,333 --> 02:18:42,135
I swear that if I would
have had the gun now. .

1957
02:18:42,200 --> 02:18:43,401
. .I would have killed you already.

1958
02:18:47,533 --> 02:18:50,736
Alright, sir. Today,
Heera is leaving.

1959
02:18:51,733 --> 02:18:56,771
Remember that I won't spare you!

1960
02:18:58,566 --> 02:19:01,802
I'll make you lose your respect!

1961
02:19:03,066 --> 02:19:06,602
Kill him. .

1962
02:19:06,666 --> 02:19:08,300
Don't let Heera live!

1963
02:19:09,566 --> 02:19:12,535
Father, his life has tormented him.

1964
02:19:12,700 --> 02:19:15,235
Take him, he is very good.

1965
02:19:15,666 --> 02:19:21,204
I was very sad to hear that
he moves around aimlessly.

1966
02:19:21,733 --> 02:19:23,367
I can't bring him home.

1967
02:19:24,133 --> 02:19:28,504
I can't embrace him; I can't
call him as my son.

1968
02:19:30,766 --> 02:19:37,072
Mohini, I beg of you.

1969
02:19:38,399 --> 02:19:40,668
Don't ever tell my son
that I am his father.

1970
02:19:41,799 --> 02:19:45,069
I am helpless. Due to my
image amongst the people. .

1971
02:19:45,133 --> 02:19:48,436
..I can't call my son as my own.

1972
02:19:49,266 --> 02:19:51,301
I request you, don't tell my son.

1973
02:19:52,799 --> 02:19:57,137
Don't tell my son. Don't
say that I am his father.

1974
02:20:27,633 --> 02:20:30,002
There he is! Bash him up!

1975
02:20:32,733 --> 02:20:34,301
Which people?
- I don't know.

1976
02:20:34,333 --> 02:20:37,002
All I know is that Mahinder
was behind the crowd.

1977
02:20:37,399 --> 02:20:38,434
Mahinder.

1978
02:20:40,299 --> 02:20:44,070
Wait! I said stop!

1979
02:20:44,433 --> 02:20:49,137
You have abused our God.
We won't spare you!

1980
02:20:49,200 --> 02:20:51,135
Stop! You have been
provoked by Mahinder.

1981
02:20:51,533 --> 02:20:53,234
You have insulted our deity.

1982
02:20:53,466 --> 02:20:55,367
Yes, I have abused your God.

1983
02:20:55,933 --> 02:20:57,601
I have insulted his evil son too.

1984
02:20:58,100 --> 02:20:59,601
Do you want to know his reality?

1985
02:20:59,666 --> 02:21:01,200
He's uttering rubbish!

1986
02:21:01,266 --> 02:21:03,234
Hit him! Hit the idiot!

1987
02:21:15,133 --> 02:21:19,937
Hit him! - Move back! Move back!

1988
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:23,002
Move back! Move back! Don't hit him!

1989
02:21:23,333 --> 02:21:25,535
Move! Move back! Move back!

1990
02:21:28,200 --> 02:21:30,969
Why did you stop? Why? Hit him!

1991
02:21:31,033 --> 02:21:35,337
He is still alive! Kill him!

1992
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,202
This is the rule of this world.

1993
02:21:38,266 --> 02:21:41,369
Bow before the rich
and hurt the poor.

1994
02:21:41,633 --> 02:21:44,235
I ask you, what has he done?

1995
02:21:44,266 --> 02:21:48,403
It is only that he spoke
for a poor man like me.

1996
02:21:48,600 --> 02:21:51,936
He spoke against the rich
who enjoy themselves. .

1997
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:53,868
. .by exploiting the poor.

1998
02:21:54,266 --> 02:21:55,333
What are you staring at?

1999
02:21:55,399 --> 02:21:58,202
Pick up a stone and
crush him. Kill him!

2000
02:21:58,266 --> 02:22:01,035
Hang him! Shut his voice!

2001
02:22:01,266 --> 02:22:03,868
You won't get such a chance again.

2002
02:22:03,933 --> 02:22:07,870
Our blood should be used
for our well-being.

2003
02:22:10,133 --> 02:22:14,170
Get up, son. This world is
not for us. You don't know.

2004
02:22:14,500 --> 02:22:17,569
The ones who say the truth
have always been hurt.

2005
02:22:17,666 --> 02:22:18,867
Get up. Come on.

2006
02:22:19,166 --> 02:22:22,135
No, Goyal. He won't go with you.

2007
02:22:22,866 --> 02:22:27,537
He won't go with anyone else.
He will go with me. With me!

2008
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,135
Sir, you?

2009
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:44,970
How are you know, son? You
were restless all night.

2010
02:22:45,299 --> 02:22:49,070
Sir, what is it now?

2011
02:22:51,066 --> 02:22:52,467
Sometimes you want to kill me.

2012
02:22:53,866 --> 02:22:58,070
Sometimes you make an
effort to save me.

2013
02:23:00,033 --> 02:23:01,300
Yesterday, you had a
gun in your hands.

2014
02:23:01,366 --> 02:23:02,867
Today, there are tears in your eyes.

2015
02:23:03,600 --> 02:23:07,003
What is this secret?

2016
02:23:08,600 --> 02:23:10,935
What do you want from me, sir? What?

2017
02:23:12,600 --> 02:23:14,301
Tell me, sir. What do you want?

2018
02:23:20,266 --> 02:23:22,067
Tell me, why did you
want to kill Heera?

2019
02:23:22,200 --> 02:23:25,069
Father!
- Answer me, Mahinder.

2020
02:23:25,566 --> 02:23:28,535
No!
- Why did you lie to me?

2021
02:23:29,533 --> 02:23:31,334
Father! Stop it, father.

2022
02:23:31,600 --> 02:23:33,601
I am asking for an answer,
Mahinder. Tell me.

2023
02:23:34,200 --> 02:23:36,936
Father.
- Tell me! Why did you lie?

2024
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:38,101
He's hurt. Don't hit him.

2025
02:23:40,933 --> 02:23:42,868
Stop it. Are you trying to kill him?

2026
02:23:42,933 --> 02:23:44,134
Yes, I am going to kill him.

2027
02:23:44,399 --> 02:23:47,402
Today, I can't be patient anymore.

2028
02:23:48,066 --> 02:23:50,935
I won't spare him. I'll hurt him.

2029
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:54,836
I will destroy this sinner!
- No! I won't let you do that!

2030
02:23:54,899 --> 02:23:55,934
Leave me, Kamini!

2031
02:23:56,399 --> 02:23:58,201
You wretched man!
- Father.

2032
02:24:05,899 --> 02:24:08,202
No, father. That's enough.

2033
02:24:09,399 --> 02:24:10,801
What can be done by killing him?

2034
02:24:12,100 --> 02:24:14,869
If you want to kill, destroy
the evil within him.

2035
02:24:15,366 --> 02:24:16,867
Remove it from his heart.

2036
02:24:17,533 --> 02:24:20,435
Hurting a man won't
change him, father.

2037
02:24:21,266 --> 02:24:24,869
Leave him. I apologize
for him. Let him go.

2038
02:24:25,899 --> 02:24:31,839
Well, father. The truth is
that I am very unfortunate.

2039
02:24:33,266 --> 02:24:35,968
Wherever I have gone, I
have spread destruction.

2040
02:24:36,866 --> 02:24:38,801
Whoever I took to be mine became a. .

2041
02:24:38,866 --> 02:24:41,335
. .stranger, an enemy or he died.

2042
02:24:42,266 --> 02:24:49,139
That is why, for this house
to be safe, I'll leave it.

2043
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:52,236
No, Heera! You won't go!

2044
02:24:57,299 --> 02:24:59,769
Mahinder, change the
path of your life.

2045
02:25:01,166 --> 02:25:04,335
Thank your stars that you
have got such a father.

2046
02:25:05,333 --> 02:25:09,370
If he forgives you, you should
consider yourself lucky.

2047
02:25:10,733 --> 02:25:12,734
Come on, apologize to him.

2048
02:25:13,033 --> 02:25:15,068
Say it, son. Say sorry.

2049
02:25:15,466 --> 02:25:17,734
Unless you apologize
to your father for. .

2050

. .your sins even God
won't forgive you.

2051
02:25:20,266 --> 02:25:23,936
Look, it's a good chance.
Touch his feet, apologize.

2052
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:25,735
Say sorry to both of them.
It will be alright.

2053
02:25:25,799 --> 02:25:28,869
They are both elder to you.
Come on, hurry. Come on!

2054
02:25:31,733 --> 02:25:34,368
Father, forgive me!

2055
02:25:56,366 --> 02:26:00,169
Heera.
- Yes, father. - Come upstairs.

2056
02:26:17,299 --> 02:26:21,771
Yes, father. - Heera, the tune
that you were whistling. .

2057
02:26:22,200 --> 02:26:24,201
Yes, it's something I remember
from my childhood.

2058
02:26:24,833 --> 02:26:29,070
Whenever, I feel happy I hum
this tune by Ms. Vidya.

2059
02:26:30,666 --> 02:26:33,802
Vidya..
- Wow! Is it about songs?

2060
02:26:34,033 --> 02:26:37,336
I thought there would never
be any singing in this house.

2061
02:26:37,399 --> 02:26:41,203
Why not?
- Father, I have my birthday today.

2062
02:26:41,399 --> 02:26:43,869
There is sadness all over the house.

2063
02:26:44,066 --> 02:26:45,767
That is why I am quiet too.

2064
02:26:45,799 --> 02:26:47,034
Is it your birthday today?

2065
02:26:47,299 --> 02:26:49,669

how your brother. .

2066

silence and sadness.

This old man was living
a bad life without you.

2151

What are you doing here?

2152
02:33:14,466 --> 02:33:15,867
I had come here to search for you.

But I met this idiot Kailash.

2154
02:33:19,666 --> 02:33:21,901
I'll ask you later how
you know Kailashnath.

2155
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,502
First tell me whose son I am.

2156
02:33:29,799 --> 02:33:31,735
I will tell you but I haven't
got liquor since two days.

2157
02:33:31,866 --> 02:33:33,267
I feel dizzy.

2158
02:33:33,866 --> 02:33:35,734
Will I get a drink?
- Yes.

2159
02:33:36,866 --> 02:33:38,667
First tell me who my father is.

2160
02:33:39,333 --> 02:33:41,868

your mother too but. .

2161
02:33:42,333 --> 02:33:49,673
My throat is parched. If I have
a drink, it will be wet again.

2162
02:33:50,399 --> 02:33:52,401
Then, I will start speaking.

2163
02:33:54,633 --> 02:33:57,702
Tell me clearly, who is my father?

2164
02:33:58,200 --> 02:34:02,804
He is a great man. You will be
very happy to hear about him.

2165
02:34:03,333 --> 02:34:06,269
You'll jump with joy if you see him.

2166
02:34:06,333 --> 02:34:07,400
Tell me, who is he?

2167
02:34:07,466 --> 02:34:10,202
How can I tell you so quickly?

2168
02:34:10,266 --> 02:34:13,602
If you meet your father,
I will be doomed.

2169
02:34:15,466 --> 02:34:17,534
I asked you for my father's name.

2170
02:34:17,933 --> 02:34:20,669
He's a famous man.
I swear, he's great!

2171

You'll be very happy to see him.

2172
02:34:23,733 --> 02:34:25,267
What's the hurry?

2173
02:34:26,333 --> 02:34:29,636
Alright, I'll tell you
your mother's name.

2174
02:34:30,600 --> 02:34:34,270
She was Vidya. She was very rich.

2175
02:34:34,333 --> 02:34:36,802
All her money was
usurped by Kailash.

2176
02:34:36,866 --> 02:34:39,401
He is the one who
made you an orphan.

2177
02:34:39,600 --> 02:34:42,869
Your father..
- Yes. What is my father's name?

2178

very happy to hear about him.

2179
02:34:48,933 --> 02:34:50,200
Yes but what is his name?

2180
02:34:50,399 --> 02:34:52,201
You'll be happy.
- What is my father's name?

2181
02:34:52,666 --> 02:34:54,267
He is a great man..

2182
02:35:04,133 --> 02:35:07,336
You?
- Yes, it's me, sir. Me!

2183
02:35:08,733 --> 02:35:12,670
Sometimes, a man leaves
a small part of his sin.

2184
02:35:13,399 --> 02:35:15,135
Destiny makes that small part much. .

2185

. .bigger and brings it before him.

2186
02:35:16,666 --> 02:35:18,401
As I am standing before you today.

2187
02:35:20,733 --> 02:35:24,670
Look at me, lawyer. I
was small at that time.

2188
02:35:25,733 --> 02:35:28,669
I was weak. Helpless and innocent.

2189
02:35:29,333 --> 02:35:32,135
You were young. Today, you are old.

2190
02:35:33,266 --> 02:35:37,770
You are weak and helpless
and I am young.

2191
02:35:38,833 --> 02:35:42,136
Man has to pay for his good
or bad in this world, sir.

2192
02:35:43,533 --> 02:35:47,270
The boy whom you disowned as
an orphan and a disgrace.

2193
02:35:48,133 --> 02:35:52,136
Today, your daughter
Ioves that orphan.

2194
02:35:53,266 --> 02:35:59,672
What? - The same story can
be repeated in your house.

2195
02:36:02,066 --> 02:36:04,468
A boy like me can be born
in your house as well.

2196
02:36:06,200 --> 02:36:10,704
Would you have him
sent away? No, sir.

2197
02:36:12,066 --> 02:36:17,538
You won't do that. This time,
the fate is against you.

2198
02:36:18,466 --> 02:36:21,068
You don't believe me, right?
Ask your daughter.

2199
02:36:22,066 --> 02:36:28,605
Child, is this true?
- Yes, father. I love Heera.

2200
02:36:30,466 --> 02:36:34,069
I hate this wealth and
this fake dignity.

2201
02:36:35,600 --> 02:36:40,071
You may assume that your child
died as she was born.

2202
02:36:41,299 --> 02:36:44,069
Or that you had her
sent away with Heera.

2203
02:36:45,166 --> 02:36:47,268
Something that has been thrown
shouldn't be picked.

2204
02:36:48,266 --> 02:36:50,067
This is the rule that you have made.

2205
02:36:51,666 --> 02:36:52,666
Come, Heera.

2206
02:37:03,266 --> 02:37:07,069
Mohini, go back to your house.

2207
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:09,601
What?
- Yes.

2208
02:37:11,133 --> 02:37:13,602
I have taken revenge
from your father.

2209
02:37:14,600 --> 02:37:19,671
I brought you before him.
He was helpless.

2210
02:37:20,666 --> 02:37:25,337
That's all. I have avenged
him. Go back home.

2211
02:37:26,600 --> 02:37:29,536
I didn't hold your hands and
Ieave home to go back.

2212
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:32,601
I left to be with you forever.

2213
02:37:33,266 --> 02:37:36,335
No, Mohini. I can't be
accompanied by anyone.

2214
02:37:37,466 --> 02:37:40,335
Destiny couldn't be
with me. How can you?

2215
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,001
I am one of those who are born. .

2216
02:37:45,066 --> 02:37:48,335
. .in this world only
with their body.

2217
02:37:48,633 --> 02:37:53,604
Our fate is undecided
and so are our stars.

2218
02:37:54,533 --> 02:37:55,600
The world doesn't need me.

2219
02:37:55,666 --> 02:37:58,335
I am excess baggage for this world.

2220
02:37:58,533 --> 02:38:02,937
No, Heera. You aren't
a derequisition. You. .

2221
02:38:06,399 --> 02:38:08,335
You are the son of a father?

2222
02:38:11,933 --> 02:38:15,202
Me? The son of a great father.

2223
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:18,667
How do you know this?

2224
02:38:19,333 --> 02:38:24,037
I know. I am telling you
this as I am forced to.

2225
02:38:25,033 --> 02:38:27,201
I am breaking the promise
that I made to your father.

2226
02:38:29,933 --> 02:38:32,135
You are Kunwar Ranvir
Singh's son, Heera.

2227
02:38:40,200 --> 02:38:45,338
Ranvir Singh? He is my father?

2228
02:38:47,133 --> 02:38:50,936
Does he know that I am his son?

2229
02:38:51,333 --> 02:38:55,103
Yes, he knows but. .

2230
02:38:58,366 --> 02:39:02,336
But he is helpless!

2231
02:39:07,266 --> 02:39:11,336
Yes. He is helpless.

2232
02:39:12,399 --> 02:39:19,607
He can't call me as his son.

2233
02:39:22,933 --> 02:39:24,467
How can he answer the world?

2234
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:32,205
What will people say?
Kunwar Ranvir Singh.

2235
02:39:33,399 --> 02:39:36,136
The one whom the world takes
to be extremely honest.

2236
02:39:36,266 --> 02:39:43,072
He was born out of wedlock.

2237
02:39:50,466 --> 02:39:52,000
His respect is in danger.

2238
02:39:54,799 --> 02:39:57,802
Just like your father,
my father too feels. .

2239
02:39:57,866 --> 02:40:01,035
. .his respect to be endangered
because of me.

2240
02:40:01,133 --> 02:40:02,434
No, Heera.
- Maybe!

2241
02:40:04,233 --> 02:40:08,804
Maybe you know that I am
the son of a rich man. .

2242
02:40:08,866 --> 02:40:13,804
. .and that is why you
accompanied me. .

2243
02:40:13,866 --> 02:40:19,004
. .and left your father's home.

2244
02:40:19,799 --> 02:40:24,271
What? Why did you speak so lowly?

2245
02:40:26,799 --> 02:40:29,402
Today, you have lost
respect before me.

2246
02:40:31,399 --> 02:40:35,504
I don't just love you, I revere you.

2247
02:40:37,233 --> 02:40:38,801
For the first time,
I have seen a man. .

2248
02:40:38,866 --> 02:40:41,468
. .who doesn't care
about his respect.

2249
02:40:42,866 --> 02:40:46,803
That is what I thought
when I left my house.

2250
02:40:48,066 --> 02:40:51,803
However, you have abused me, Heera.

2251
02:40:52,733 --> 02:40:53,800
You have abused me!

2252
02:40:56,066 --> 02:40:59,736
I thought you would be happy. .

2253
02:40:59,799 --> 02:41:03,803
. .to hear that you are his son.

2254
02:41:04,066 --> 02:41:05,467
What should I do about
this happiness?

2255
02:41:06,866 --> 02:41:09,735
What do I do if I am
the son of a man..

2256
02:41:09,766 --> 02:41:10,967
. .who can't call him as his son?

2257
02:41:11,933 --> 02:41:13,801
That man, Gangu, was better.

2258
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,001
At least he called me his
son when he was drunk.

2259
02:41:16,399 --> 02:41:20,337
I could be proud and say
that he is my father.

2260
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:27,738
If it is so, I swear by our
Iove that I will never..

2261
02:41:27,799 --> 02:41:31,803
. .even by mistake mention
that you are his son.

2262
02:41:33,399 --> 02:41:37,804
I bind you to my word
not to say this.

2263
02:41:46,133 --> 02:41:47,334
Forgive me, Mohini.

2264
02:41:50,333 --> 02:41:53,936
I have been cheated so
many times in life. .

2265
02:41:55,266 --> 02:42:01,071
Now I am confused between our
Ioved ones and outsiders.

2266
02:42:05,666 --> 02:42:07,134
Come, I'll take you
to Kumar's house.

2267
02:42:08,266 --> 02:42:11,669
What? - I told you, you
would be surprised.

2268
02:42:11,899 --> 02:42:14,068
Tell me, do you want
a son or a daughter?

2269
02:42:14,100 --> 02:42:16,669
Padma, why are you bringing
a boy and girl in between?

2270
02:42:16,700 --> 02:42:19,135
Our youth is to have fun, my dear.

2271
02:42:19,266 --> 02:42:20,333
I'm telling you the truth, Mahinder.

2272
02:42:20,666 --> 02:42:22,334
I am pregnant with your child.

2273
02:42:22,666 --> 02:42:24,868
Padma! The same old rubbish again.

2274
02:42:24,933 --> 02:42:29,203
Every girl I speak to says
that she is pregnant.

2275
02:42:30,133 --> 02:42:34,670
Are you saying this? I am. .

2276
02:42:34,733 --> 02:42:38,069
What? I would come here in the
morning and the evening.

2277
02:42:38,266 --> 02:42:39,667
Who came here in the afternoon. .

2278
02:42:41,666 --> 02:42:43,868
What is it? Is the truth bitter?

2279
02:42:44,799 --> 02:42:46,301
What are you staring at?

2280
02:42:46,799 --> 02:42:49,369
If you want to complain against
me, go to a market.

2281
02:42:49,666 --> 02:42:52,201
Climb onto a temple.
Shout to the world.

2282
02:42:52,266 --> 02:42:53,867
Say that you are pregnant
with my child.

2283
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,669
If it's still useless,
I have a way out.

2284
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,869
I said, 'listen, Padma is pregnant# 

2285
02:42:59,933 --> 02:43:03,269
He said it's alright.
'Get an abortion done# 

2286
02:43:04,266 --> 02:43:07,335
I said, 'what are you saying?'

2287
02:43:07,399 --> 02:43:10,870
Abortion is a big sin!
It's a great sin.

2288
02:43:10,933 --> 02:43:13,935
'Go and climb onto to the
Red Fort's tall walls# 

2289
02:43:14,200 --> 02:43:16,869
'Shout out that you are
pregnant with my child# 

2290
02:43:17,333 --> 02:43:19,101
'If you still don't
feel satisfied. # 

2291
02:43:19,666 --> 02:43:21,667
'Radio singer, go to the
radio station and. .

2292
02:43:21,700 --> 02:43:23,168
. .sing songs that would defame me# 

2293
02:43:25,100 --> 02:43:29,938
You are still quiet? Kunwar, listen.

2294
02:43:30,266 --> 02:43:33,869
You may be quiet but I won't be.

2295
02:43:33,933 --> 02:43:35,934
I will get justice for my daughter.

2296
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,335
Even if I would have to
reply to your deeds. .

2297
02:43:38,399 --> 02:43:41,202
. .I won't hesitate.
I will get justice.

2298
02:43:41,799 --> 02:43:43,268
I have come to change my will.

2299
02:43:43,666 --> 02:43:46,802
Why? For Mahinder..
- I don't want to give him anything.

2300
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:48,067
Why so?

2301
02:43:49,666 --> 02:43:56,906
We feel sad if we
don't have a child.

2302
02:43:58,200 --> 02:44:03,004
If we have a child and he
dies, we feel very sad.

2303
02:44:04,733 --> 02:44:10,672
r
If we have a worthless son
we can't bear it.

2304
02:44:14,133 --> 02:44:18,937
Come here. It will be here.
In this drawer.

2305
02:44:21,600 --> 02:44:23,134
Father doesn't let anyone
come to this room.

2306
02:44:28,200 --> 02:44:32,203
Vidya! How did this photo come here?

2307
02:44:34,600 --> 02:44:38,070
This means Vidya loved Kunwar.

2308
02:44:40,266 --> 02:44:42,868
Heera is Kunwar's son.

2309
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:51,270
Mr. Kunwar!
- Wow! This is my son!

2310
02:44:52,733 --> 02:44:54,201
This is my friend, the lawyer.

2311
02:44:55,200 --> 02:44:56,868
Did you come to steal my will?

2312
02:44:57,533 --> 02:44:58,867
This is my will, steal it.

2313
02:44:58,933 --> 02:45:00,868
Mr. Kunwar, I am very sorry.

2314
02:45:00,933 --> 02:45:03,735
Now you'll be really disgraced
before your daughter.

2315
02:45:04,133 --> 02:45:05,534
She is sleeping here
in this very house.

2316
02:45:06,666 --> 02:45:10,669
When she finds out about her
father, she will hate you. .

2317
02:45:10,733 --> 02:45:12,534
Mr. Kunwar!
- As much as I hate my son.

2318
02:45:12,600 --> 02:45:15,869
Forgive me.
- Father.

2319
02:45:16,133 --> 02:45:18,735
It will be better if
you kill yourself.

2320
02:45:19,133 --> 02:45:20,934
Forgive me, father.
- Go, get lost!

2321
02:45:21,066 --> 02:45:22,600
What are you doing?

2322
02:45:22,666 --> 02:45:24,667
For a small mistake you are
sending away your son?

2323
02:45:24,733 --> 02:45:26,534
I don't want such a son
to stay in my house.

2324
02:45:26,866 --> 02:45:29,935
If you pity your son,
Ieave along with him.

2325
02:45:30,866 --> 02:45:31,933
Go now!

2326
02:45:44,533 --> 02:45:46,668
Heera isn't just your father's heir.

2327
02:45:47,666 --> 02:45:50,201
He is also the heir
to all my property.

2328
02:45:51,799 --> 02:45:53,468
Your property? How's that?

2329
02:45:54,466 --> 02:45:56,868
His mother had kept it all for him.

2330
02:45:57,799 --> 02:46:00,536
Mahinder, with you I
too will be bankrupt.

2331
02:46:00,866 --> 02:46:03,468
If you delay, remember that you. .

2332
02:46:03,533 --> 02:46:05,468
. .would have to beg all your life.

2333
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,769
You will be as Heera was earlier.

2334
02:46:09,766 --> 02:46:12,935
You employed him but he
won't give you a job.

2335
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:15,067
What should I do?

2336
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,469
Heera is your enemy and mine too.

2337
02:46:20,666 --> 02:46:23,535
Mahinder, your father insulted
me and threw me out.

2338
02:46:24,466 --> 02:46:27,669
We will have to remove them forever.

2339
02:46:28,066 --> 02:46:31,068
They will have to be cleared.
This is the only way for you.

2340
02:46:31,466 --> 02:46:34,068
My father too?
- Look, Mahinder.

2341
02:46:34,666 --> 02:46:37,802
You have to leave all that
and start life afresh.

2342
02:46:59,399 --> 02:47:02,736
Take Kunwar and get to..
- My. .

2343
02:47:03,866 --> 02:47:05,867
Will you kill Heera?

2344
02:47:16,633 --> 02:47:18,601
Kunwar has been taken to Chandanwadi
by some thugs.

2345
02:47:18,666 --> 02:47:21,135
His life is in danger. Go there
quickly. I'll get the police.

2346
02:47:22,399 --> 02:47:23,467
What happened to Heera?

2347
02:47:23,533 --> 02:47:25,601
Mahinder's men are beating him up.

2348
02:47:26,399 --> 02:47:27,667
Where?
- In Chandanwadi.

2349
02:47:39,799 --> 02:47:40,867
No!

2350
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:57,002
Gangu! What is it? Who is this man?

2351
02:47:57,066 --> 02:48:01,003
He wants to kill Heera
and Ranvir Singh.

2352
02:48:01,600 --> 02:48:02,734
Your father has sent him.

2353
02:48:02,933 --> 02:48:04,000
What? !
- Yes.

2354
02:48:04,933 --> 02:48:07,335
Where is Chandanwadi? Chandanwadi!

2355
02:48:07,399 --> 02:48:08,667
Chandanwadi? It's behind
that mountain.

2356
02:48:08,866 --> 02:48:10,067
It's short-cut is from here.

2357
02:48:10,533 --> 02:48:13,335
Go on. I'll take care
of him. Go carefully.

2358
02:48:17,866 --> 02:48:19,867
Mahinder.
- Lawyer!

2359
02:48:20,333 --> 02:48:21,567
Is everything alright?
- Don't worry.

2360
02:48:21,633 --> 02:48:23,334
I have arranged it in
such a way that. .

2361
02:48:23,366 --> 02:48:25,868
. .father and son will be coming
to save each other.

2362
02:48:26,733 --> 02:48:30,870
Father! Father!

2363
02:48:34,333 --> 02:48:37,335
Heera! Heera!

2364
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:42,067
Heera !

2365
02:48:43,933 --> 02:48:45,000
Father!

2366
02:48:48,466 --> 02:48:49,533
Heera !

2367
02:48:52,666 --> 02:48:53,700
Father!

2368
02:48:57,366 --> 02:48:58,533
Heera !
- Father!

2369
02:49:00,533 --> 02:49:01,600
Father.

2370
02:49:01,666 --> 02:49:03,267
Heera, are you alright?

2371
02:49:03,333 --> 02:49:04,600
Yes, father. Are you fine?

2372
02:49:05,266 --> 02:49:06,600
The lawyer told me that you. .

2373
02:49:07,600 --> 02:49:08,667
Something is wrong, father.

2374
02:49:10,933 --> 02:49:13,735
You fool!

2375
02:49:24,266 --> 02:49:26,868
Father! Father! What have you done?

2376
02:49:27,399 --> 02:49:28,667
You hurt yourself for me?

2377
02:49:30,866 --> 02:49:33,868
Father.
- Mahinder, what is going on?

2378
02:49:34,533 --> 02:49:39,337
This is not blood, son.
This is liquor.

2379
02:49:39,866 --> 02:49:44,870
I drank it all my life due to you.

2380
02:49:45,933 --> 02:49:51,872
Son, I have given you so much
sorrow that I will go to hell.

2381
02:49:53,200 --> 02:50:00,607
I swear, that I will go there
with respect. Right?

2382
02:50:01,700 --> 02:50:04,235
Father.
- Mahinder!

2383
02:50:04,433 --> 02:50:06,268
What are you staring at? It's
a good chance. Shoot him!

2384
02:50:07,600 --> 02:50:08,667
No, Mahinder!

2385
02:50:12,399 --> 02:50:14,201
Father! Father!

2386
02:50:15,333 --> 02:50:18,469
Don't worry about me, Heera.
Catch that fool.

2387
02:50:20,799 --> 02:50:23,936
Bhuka! Heera shouldn't
catch Mahinder!

2388
02:50:24,333 --> 02:50:25,600
Don't spare him.

2389
02:50:29,799 --> 02:50:33,537
Kunwar, you insulted me and
removed me from your house.

2390
02:50:34,433 --> 02:50:36,601
I will kill you today.

2391
02:50:38,266 --> 02:50:39,333
Hands up!

2392
02:50:39,399 --> 02:50:42,469
Mahinder has made everyone
here against you.

2393
02:50:45,600 --> 02:50:49,870
Heera gave me this key.
It is to a drawer.

2394
02:50:50,200 --> 02:50:51,401
Many weapons have been placed there.

2395
02:50:51,600 --> 02:50:55,537
Move on, coward. Move!
- Wait!

2396
02:50:56,133 --> 02:50:59,536
Now tell them to throw
away their weapons.

2397
02:51:00,733 --> 02:51:03,335
Say it!
- Discard your weaponry.

2398
02:51:05,733 --> 02:51:10,571
Good, now give me your
gun and take handcuffs.

2399
02:51:11,133 --> 02:51:16,137
Stop there! Otherwise I'll
put this into your mouth.

2400
02:51:44,133 --> 02:51:46,401
Move on, lawyer. Let's
go to a police station.

2401
02:51:46,466 --> 02:51:47,867
Now you will have to stay in jail.

2402
02:51:48,133 --> 02:51:50,668
Doctor uncle, you did right.

2403
02:51:52,600 --> 02:51:55,069
Catch him! Run! Get him.

2404
02:52:14,066 --> 02:52:16,101
Come along, brothers. Come!

2405
02:52:16,500 --> 02:52:20,136
This is your holy man!
Look at his true form.

2406
02:52:21,333 --> 02:52:24,069
Kunwar, it has been many
days since you. .

2407
02:52:24,133 --> 02:52:25,534
. .came to ask about my daughter.

2408
02:52:25,600 --> 02:52:28,069
I thought you would call
me and say that. .

2409
02:52:28,133 --> 02:52:31,069
. .this girl is yours
and the boy is mine.

2410
02:52:31,133 --> 02:52:33,468
Just think. You have
a young daughter too.

2411
02:52:33,533 --> 02:52:37,069
If this would happen to her,
would you be quiet?

2412
02:52:37,399 --> 02:52:39,735
Your silence has forced me.

2413
02:52:40,066 --> 02:52:42,067
Kunwar, today there will be justice. .

2414
02:52:42,133 --> 02:52:44,335
. .or the matter will be cleared.

2415
02:52:45,700 --> 02:52:48,469
He is quiet! Brothers, move on!

2416
02:52:48,500 --> 02:52:49,567
I say stop!

2417
02:52:50,100 --> 02:52:53,536
Don't force me to be as
I was 25 years ago.

2418
02:52:54,200 --> 02:52:57,670
I didn't value humanity then.
- Brothers. .

2419
02:54:48,666 --> 02:54:49,733
No!

2420
02:54:51,066 --> 02:54:52,934
No, Heera! No!

2421
02:54:53,066 --> 02:54:54,133
No, Heera!

2422
02:54:54,399 --> 02:54:55,934
No Heera, no!

2423
02:54:56,466 --> 02:54:57,934
Mahinder, every man has to suffer. .

2424
02:54:57,966 --> 02:55:00,335
. .punishment for his deeds.

2425
02:55:01,033 --> 02:55:04,936
If he accepts his crime, his
punishment is reduced.

2426
02:55:05,399 --> 02:55:08,336
Come before father and accept
to your crime. - No.

2427
02:55:08,600 --> 02:55:11,002
I ask you for justice, accountant.

2428
02:55:12,200 --> 02:55:16,938
Selfish people like you have
ruined my son's life.

2429
02:55:17,600 --> 02:55:21,403
Tell me, how should I punish
you? Tell me. Speak!

2430
02:55:21,466 --> 02:55:26,671
Father! Here, I have
brought Mahinder.

2431
02:55:29,533 --> 02:55:30,600
Come on, apologise!

2432
02:55:34,566 --> 02:55:37,535
Father, forgive me.

2433
02:55:39,600 --> 02:55:44,071
You are not my son. You're not.

2434
02:55:46,266 --> 02:55:52,271
You are evil from my past
that I have to suffer.

2435
02:55:54,133 --> 02:55:58,604
To atone for my sins, I
feel like killing you.

2436
02:55:59,399 --> 02:56:02,269
So that my sin is finished
along with you.

2437
02:56:04,399 --> 02:56:05,467
However, I won't do so.

2438
02:56:06,299 --> 02:56:09,903
Till today, I have fulfilled
your wants, right and wrong.

2439
02:56:11,399 --> 02:56:13,935
Today, I will fulfill
your last wish too.

2440
02:56:14,333 --> 02:56:16,401
You want to kill me, right?
Take this gun and shoot me.

2441
02:56:17,466 --> 02:56:23,338
Father, I am guilty!
Clear your disgrace!

2442
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:27,203
Shoot me!
- Come. Come, inspector.

2443
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:29,067
Come, quickly.

2444
02:56:29,266 --> 02:56:31,067
We caught the lawyer.
He was running.

2445
02:56:31,333 --> 02:56:32,467
The other party is in the jeep.

2446
02:56:32,533 --> 02:56:34,935
The third is our young master.

2447
02:56:37,533 --> 02:56:38,600
Come, Mr. Mahinder.

2448
02:56:40,266 --> 02:56:42,868
Father! Stop them, father.

2449
02:56:43,299 --> 02:56:48,138
If they take Mahinder,
what will I do?

2450
02:56:48,399 --> 02:56:50,201
I will..
- Don't worry, Padma.

2451
02:56:51,399 --> 02:56:54,469
I will take care of your child.
I will accept you.

2452
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,001
Heera! What are you saying?

2453
02:56:57,066 --> 02:57:00,135
Yes, Mohini. You have everything.

2454
02:57:00,466 --> 02:57:02,267
You can forget me and
spend your life.

2455
02:57:02,333 --> 02:57:04,334
However, I know how
this story will end.

2456
02:57:05,066 --> 02:57:06,467
Another orphaned child will be born!

2457
02:57:07,066 --> 02:57:08,400
He will feel lost in the world.

2458
02:57:08,866 --> 02:57:11,802
He will take his poisonous
life and die. .

2459
02:57:11,833 --> 02:57:14,202
. .or he will become like me.
A tree full of thorns.

2460
02:57:15,833 --> 02:57:18,468
Let me take her.
- No, Heera.

2461
02:57:19,799 --> 02:57:21,468
He won't be a tree with thorns.

2462
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:27,270
He won't be an orphan but
Ranvir Singh's grandson.

2463
02:57:28,799 --> 02:57:31,202
Inspector, take him.

2464
02:57:47,033 --> 02:57:48,100
Father.

2465
02:57:49,299 --> 02:57:53,470
What order do you have
for me, father?

2466
02:57:54,733 --> 02:57:55,800
Heera.

2467
02:58:01,333 --> 02:58:02,467
If you. .

2468
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:07,003
Oh! I understand, father.

2469
02:58:09,399 --> 02:58:10,467
I get it.

2470
02:58:12,866 --> 02:58:14,734
I'm leaving, father.
- Where will you go?

2471
02:58:16,399 --> 02:58:18,368
I'll go anywhere, father,
but I won't stay here.

2472
02:58:21,033 --> 02:58:27,205
You may think that a
servant was with you.

2473
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:35,473
He served you and left.
He left! He left!

2474
02:58:35,733 --> 02:58:38,402
Heera! Wait, Heera!

2475
02:58:38,866 --> 02:58:42,803
Heera! For God's sake! Stop, Heera!

2476
02:58:43,799 --> 02:58:46,202
Don't go, Heera! Don't go.

2477
02:58:46,333 --> 02:58:49,135
Wait, Heera! I'm coming with you.

2478
02:58:50,733 --> 02:58:54,903
Stop, Heera! I bind you
to my word, Heera!

2479
02:58:54,966 --> 02:58:56,100
Stop, Heera!

2480
02:58:56,899 --> 02:58:58,001
Heera stop! Heera!

2481
02:58:58,066 --> 02:58:59,133
Heera !

2482
02:59:00,266 --> 02:59:02,067
Stop Heera! For God's
sake! Stop, Heera!

2483
02:59:03,066 --> 02:59:05,334
Don't go, Heera! Don't go.

2484
02:59:05,399 --> 02:59:07,201
Stop, Heera! Heera!

2485
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:09,067
Heera !

2486
02:59:12,933 --> 02:59:16,803
Look, I am an unfortunate father.

2487
02:59:17,799 --> 02:59:19,668
I don't have anyone
to clear my tears.

2488
02:59:21,933 --> 02:59:23,134
Stop, Heera!

2489
02:59:26,799 --> 02:59:30,069
You are not an orphan, I am!

2490
02:59:32,666 --> 02:59:33,800
Stop, my son!

2491
02:59:41,399 --> 02:59:43,668
I can't be assured
about my life, son.

2492
02:59:45,333 --> 02:59:49,804
Only an elder son gives fire
to his father's pyre.

2493
02:59:51,200 --> 02:59:53,068
Don't take away my right.

2494
02:59:53,866 --> 02:59:56,201
Don't take away my right, my son.

2495
02:59:57,833 --> 03:00:01,002
Come back, son!
- Father.

2496
03:00:26,600 --> 03:00:29,602
''He may be. .''

2497
03:00:31,133 --> 03:00:35,704
''He may be delayed. .''

2498
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:40,270
''But he will never leave us.''

2499
03:00:40,600 --> 03:00:43,602
''Good deeds.. ''

2500
03:00:45,200 --> 03:00:49,804
''Every good deed is rewarded,
friends.''

2501
03:00:49,866 --> 03:00:53,536
''The one who doesn't have
anyone has God, friends.''

2502
03:00:54,666 --> 03:00:57,802
''The one who doesn't have
