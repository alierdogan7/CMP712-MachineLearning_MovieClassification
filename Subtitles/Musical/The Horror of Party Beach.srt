00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:48,398
Knock it off, Tina.

3
00:01:59,898 --> 00:02:00,782
I'd lay off the booze, Tina.

4
00:02:00,782 --> 00:02:01,782
You've had enough.

5
00:02:01,782 --> 00:02:04,922
Today, Tina and alcohol are
gonna have a great cocktail.

6
00:02:08,312 --> 00:02:09,532
Look, you booze it all you want

7
00:02:09,532 --> 00:02:11,252
But you better lay off me.

8
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:12,572
You better stand on your feet

9
00:02:12,572 --> 00:02:13,552
Because if you fall on your face,

10
00:02:13,552 --> 00:02:14,452
I'm not gonna pick you up.

11
00:02:14,452 --> 00:02:15,262
You understand?

12
00:02:15,262 --> 00:02:17,372
When did you ever have to carry me home?

13
00:02:17,372 --> 00:02:20,162
I've always been able to
stand on my own two feet.

14
00:02:20,162 --> 00:02:22,017
I never needed you,

15
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,217
And I never will.

16
00:02:24,387 --> 00:02:25,647
Say, whatever happened to campus big-shot

17
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:26,863
That'd do anything for kicks?

18
00:02:26,863 --> 00:02:28,502
Campus big-shot's grown up.

19
00:02:28,502 --> 00:02:29,642
Times have changed, Tina.

20
00:02:29,642 --> 00:02:31,112
We're not a buch of kids anymore.

21
00:02:31,582 --> 00:02:32,702
I've got plans.

22
00:02:32,702 --> 00:02:34,337
You can do all the partying you want.

23
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:36,342
You better stay out of my way.

24
00:02:36,342 --> 00:02:37,772
Stop preaching.

25
00:02:38,262 --> 00:02:40,122
I know about your plans.

26
00:02:40,122 --> 00:02:43,282
Your experiments in that laboratory.

27
00:02:43,282 --> 00:02:44,942
Well, let me tell you something,

28
00:02:44,942 --> 00:02:46,282
I have a few experiments of my own

29
00:02:46,282 --> 00:02:47,667
I'm just itching to try,

30
00:02:48,257 --> 00:02:49,857
And they don't have one thing to do

31
00:02:49,857 --> 00:02:51,807
With test tubes and bunsen burners.

32
00:02:51,873 --> 00:02:54,242
Okay, Tina if that's what you want.

33
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,937
(Gasps)

34
00:02:57,707 --> 00:03:00,018
Oh, Hank, what's happening to us?

35
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:03,067
So when are you gonna
get it through your head

36
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:05,098
That life isn't just all fun and games?

37
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:07,757
Okay, okay, no more lectures.

38
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:11,297
We're not even talking
the same language anymore.

39
00:03:12,787 --> 00:03:13,942
All right if that's the way you want it,

40
00:03:13,942 --> 00:03:16,213
Then you just go on your way,

41
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:17,532
And I'll go mine.

42
00:03:17,962 --> 00:03:20,152
We'll see who gets the most out of life.

43
00:03:20,582 --> 00:03:22,302
Oh, brother, you ain't seen livin'

44

She doesn't want to go with you.

♫ The zombie stomp is fun to do

262
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:06,428

I don't know I've never been...

266
00:21:17,082 --> 00:21:18,522
You've never been kissed?

267
00:21:18,522 --> 00:21:20,372
No, I've never been sick.

268

♫ What good is a man

279
00:21:58,845 --> 00:22:00,665
♫ Without a woman

280
00:22:00,665 --> 00:22:02,105

♫ And what good am I ♫

282
00:22:05,563 --> 00:22:06,693
Hiya, Charlie.

283
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:08,422
Do you like bathing beauties?

284
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:10,689
I don't know, I never bathed one?

285
00:22:10,689 --> 00:22:12,667
(Laughter)

286
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:15,657

(Reel clicking)

290
00:22:49,845 --> 00:22:51,393
Well, what happened to her?

291
00:22:51,393 --> 00:22:52,533
Hit and run or something?

292
00:22:52,533 --> 00:22:54,513
That's, uhm, why we called you, sir.

293
00:22:54,513 --> 00:22:55,613
It was no accident.

294
00:22:55,613 --> 00:22:58,211
She was found that way at Painter's Point.

295
00:22:58,211 --> 00:22:59,651
Some kids were having a party,

296
00:22:59,651 --> 00:23:01,131
She wondered off,

297
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:02,591
10 minutes later she was dead.

298
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:04,371
Uh-huh, the papers have it?

299
00:23:04,371 --> 00:23:05,771
The Daily Herald has wind of it.

300
00:23:05,771 --> 00:23:07,391
There's a reporter out there now,

301
00:23:07,391 --> 00:23:10,191
Muttering about sea
monsters, that sort of thing.

302
00:23:10,191 --> 00:23:11,151
Any statements?

303
00:23:11,151 --> 00:23:12,811
My men questioned everyone at the party.

304
00:23:12,811 --> 00:23:14,711
They all gave the same story.

305
00:23:14,711 --> 00:23:16,511
They think something came out of the sea.

306
00:23:16,511 --> 00:23:17,511
Ridiculous.

307
00:23:17,511 --> 00:23:19,111
That's what I thought, Lieutenant.

308
00:23:19,111 --> 00:23:21,731
Whoever did this couldn't
have come over by land,

309
00:23:21,731 --> 00:23:23,011
Musta come from the sea.

310
00:23:23,011 --> 00:23:24,671
Maybe a while shark or something?

311
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:25,951
Any blood smears?

312
00:23:25,951 --> 00:23:27,771
We're running the standard tests

313
00:23:27,771 --> 00:23:30,151
Uh, Gavin, Doctor Gavin.

314
00:23:30,151 --> 00:23:31,901
Get him to work on this.

315
00:23:32,851 --> 00:23:36,981
(Siren wailing)

316
00:23:50,131 --> 00:23:50,711
Morning.

317
00:23:50,711 --> 00:23:51,941
Morning

318
00:23:53,091 --> 00:23:54,501
Nice morning.

319
00:23:55,271 --> 00:23:56,461
Looks like a clear day.

320
00:23:57,831 --> 00:23:59,031
I was just looking at that little cloud

321
00:23:59,031 --> 00:24:01,471
Up there by the sun and
thinking it might rain.

322
00:24:01,471 --> 00:24:02,931
I guess everybody interprets the world

323
00:24:02,931 --> 00:24:04,681
According to his own mood. (Laughs)

324
00:24:04,827 --> 00:24:07,007
Well, no weather's good for a funeral.

325
00:24:07,007 --> 00:24:08,617
In my business I try to avoid them.

326
00:24:09,527 --> 00:24:11,957
Elaine, it's 9:30.

327
00:24:13,687 --> 00:24:15,617
I guess she'd be abnormal,
if she were on time.

328
00:24:16,487 --> 00:24:17,931
How's she taking it?

329
00:24:17,935 --> 00:24:19,335
It's not easy for any of us.

330
00:24:19,335 --> 00:24:21,217
A lot of families have
been affected by this.

331
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,277
Helps her to know she's not alone.

332
00:24:24,027 --> 00:24:25,631
Here's the sample that you asked for.

333
00:24:27,781 --> 00:24:30,231
I'm gonna run some carbon-14
tests on this tissue.

334
00:24:30,475 --> 00:24:31,713
There have been some recent discoveries

335
00:24:31,713 --> 00:24:33,013
In the field of genetics,

336
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,763
That may give us a clue to its structure.

337
00:24:34,811 --> 00:24:35,849
Good luck, Doctor.

338
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,159
Thanks, Bye.

339
00:24:44,623 --> 00:24:48,853
(Sirens wailing)

340
00:24:50,681 --> 00:24:52,047
Oh, you're ready.

341
00:24:53,137 --> 00:24:54,497
You do understand why I'm not going,

342
00:24:54,497 --> 00:24:55,311
Don't you, dear?

343
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:56,377
Of course, Daddy.

344
00:24:57,047 --> 00:24:59,465
Everybody knows how hard
you've been working.

345
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:01,545
You gonna pick up Hank on the way?

346
00:25:01,545 --> 00:25:02,511
Yes.

347
00:25:04,361 --> 00:25:06,251
Oh, Daddy, I'm so upset about Hank.

348
00:25:07,701 --> 00:25:10,141
Here I am, going to Tina's funeral,

349
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:12,411
And I have such feelings about him.

350
00:25:13,081 --> 00:25:14,581
What kind of feelings?

351
00:25:14,581 --> 00:25:15,949
I don't know!

352
00:25:17,007 --> 00:25:18,585
Is it because he's free now?

353
00:25:20,355 --> 00:25:23,225
Yes, I suppose so.

354
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:26,191
You go ahead, dear.

355
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,417
I'll get to work.

356
00:25:30,427 --> 00:25:34,247
(Engine revving)

357
00:25:36,865 --> 00:25:39,385
It's a human thing, Dr. Gavin.

358
00:25:39,385 --> 00:25:43,245
It's a human, evil thing,
lurking and creeping

359
00:25:43,245 --> 00:25:45,835
Crawling around out there, in the night.

360
00:25:45,841 --> 00:25:47,851
I know it, I feel it.

361
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:50,441
You mustn't talk like that.

362
00:25:50,441 --> 00:25:53,281
A great deal of the ocean
is still a mystery to us.

363
00:25:53,281 --> 00:25:54,511
There are undoubtedly forms of life

364
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,341
That we know nothing about.

365
00:25:56,349 --> 00:25:58,617
It's that voodoo, that's what it is.

366
00:25:59,107 --> 00:26:01,207
Now that's ridiculous, Eulabelle.

367
00:26:01,207 --> 00:26:04,157
I want you to get this idea
of voodoo out of your head.

368
00:26:05,187 --> 00:26:07,007
I have no doubt we'll find
a perfectly reasonable

369
00:26:07,007 --> 00:26:08,735
Explanation for the girl's death.

370
00:26:10,405 --> 00:26:12,105
Maybe you right,

371
00:26:12,105 --> 00:26:13,525
But the police have been looking

372
00:26:13,525 --> 00:26:15,005
And they haven't found anything.

373
00:26:15,005 --> 00:26:17,525
They been running around
here like head-less chickens.

374
00:26:17,525 --> 00:26:20,515
And you been looking and
reading, and what have you found?

375
00:26:20,723 --> 00:26:22,921
Nothing is solved in a few hours.

376
00:26:22,921 --> 00:26:24,711
This'll require a lot of research.

377
00:26:25,201 --> 00:26:26,981
And while you're researching,

378
00:26:26,981 --> 00:26:29,596
There's something creeping
and crawling and lurking

379
00:26:29,596 --> 00:26:30,913
Around out there.

380
00:26:30,913 --> 00:26:32,662
That's enough!

381
00:26:40,092 --> 00:26:41,823
It's the voodoo, that's what it is.

382
00:26:43,672 --> 00:26:45,282
You better go to bed, Eulabelle.

383
00:26:46,332 --> 00:26:47,462
Did you lock up?

384
00:26:47,812 --> 00:26:50,013
Locked, double locked,
and triple locked.

385
00:26:50,013 --> 00:26:52,302
Ain't no monsters gonna
get in here tonight.

386
00:26:56,812 --> 00:26:58,342
It's the voodoo, all right.

387
00:27:18,192 --> 00:27:18,952
[Elaine] Hi, Daddy.

388
00:27:18,952 --> 00:27:19,733
Hello, dear.

389
00:27:21,703 --> 00:27:23,503
I thought you were going out tonight?

390
00:27:23,503 --> 00:27:25,924
Oh, I was, but it's just
another slumber party.

391
00:27:26,843 --> 00:27:29,889
They're all the same so I'm
not really missing anything.

392
00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:31,509
Did you let 'em know you weren't coming?

393
00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:32,589
No.

394
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:34,389
Don't you think you should?

395
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:37,089
Oh, Daddy, I just don't
see how you can even think

396
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:39,726
Of such a thing after
what happened to Tina.

397
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:43,796
Tina's death has affected
a great many people,

398
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:45,055
But it doesn't give you or anyone else

399
00:27:45,055 --> 00:27:46,625
The right to be discourteous.

400
00:27:47,935 --> 00:27:50,505
Oh, all right, I'll go telephone.

401
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:56,325
(Laughter)

402
00:27:59,465 --> 00:28:00,491
Okay

403
00:28:00,491 --> 00:28:03,372
(Laughter)

404
00:28:03,372 --> 00:28:04,903
(Telephone ringing)

405
00:28:04,903 --> 00:28:06,506
[Voiceover] Shhhh!

406
00:28:07,857 --> 00:28:08,862
Hello.

407
00:28:10,092 --> 00:28:10,947
It's for Livvie

408
00:28:10,947 --> 00:28:11,987
Livvy, it's for you.

409
00:28:11,987 --> 00:28:13,778
[All] Livvy (giggling)

410
00:28:16,387 --> 00:28:16,784
Hi.

411
00:28:17,914 --> 00:28:18,870
Hi, Elaine.

412
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:19,960
Where are you?

413
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:23,419
Why?

414
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:26,539
Oh, Elaine, you're gonna miss all the fun.

415
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,729
Oh, Elaine, we've got secret information

416
00:28:28,729 --> 00:28:31,539
That the boys from the Kya
Psi House are gonna crash.

417
00:28:32,429 --> 00:28:34,639
We've gotta big bucket
rigged up over the door.

418
00:28:35,069 --> 00:28:36,949
I can't wait to see Ricky Oeder's

419
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:38,719
As he comes through the door
and gets it spilled on him.

420
00:28:39,604 --> 00:28:41,174
Oh, Elaine, please come.

421
00:28:41,182 --> 00:28:42,512
It'll be so much fun.

422
00:28:44,702 --> 00:28:45,832
Well, okay.

423
00:28:46,342 --> 00:28:46,960
All right.

424
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,110
I understand.

425
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:49,930
Goodbye.

426
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,660
Goodbye, Livvie.

427
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:55,948
I'm glad I called, Daddy.

428
00:28:55,948 --> 00:28:57,658
It was the right thing to do.

429
00:28:58,328 --> 00:29:02,558
♫ Oh, that is the fortune

430
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:05,946
♫ Of all woman-kind

431
00:29:05,946 --> 00:29:08,887
♫ They're always controlled ♫

432
00:29:08,887 --> 00:29:12,874
(Foreboding music drowns out singing)

433
00:29:14,124 --> 00:29:18,064
♫ Controlled by their parents

434
00:29:18,064 --> 00:29:21,972
♫ Until they are wives

435
00:29:21,972 --> 00:29:25,380
♫ Then slaves to their husbands ♫

436
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,260
(Foreboding music drowns out singing)

437
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,160
♫ Always been courted

438
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,985
♫ By the Wagoner's lad

439
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:50,971
♫ He courted me daily

440
00:29:50,971 --> 00:29:53,630
♫ By night and by day ♫

441
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:56,721
(Foreboding music drowns out singing)

442
00:29:57,687 --> 00:30:00,234
♫ And going away ♫

443
00:30:00,234 --> 00:30:01,891
(Foreboding music)

444
00:30:01,891 --> 00:30:06,281
(Laughter)

445
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,141
Shhh, what was that!

446
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,341
Come on.

447
00:30:16,571 --> 00:30:17,801
[Voiceover] What are they doing?

448
00:30:17,805 --> 00:30:19,661
[Voiceover] I smell something awful.

449
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:21,371
Smells like dead fish.

450
00:30:21,536 --> 00:30:24,237
[Voiceover] Ew, I hope
they don't throw fish again.

451
00:30:24,237 --> 00:30:25,967
Like they did last year.

452
00:30:26,476 --> 00:30:28,807
[Voiceover] Shhh, quiet girls.

453
00:30:33,217 --> 00:30:35,527
Everybody keep quiet,
I'll turn off the lights.

454
00:30:49,037 --> 00:30:51,428
Okay, boys, the door's open!

455
00:30:51,428 --> 00:30:55,928
(Giggling)

456
00:31:00,387 --> 00:31:04,118
(Anxious, chaotic music)

457
00:31:09,348 --> 00:31:13,947
(Girls screaming)
(monsters groaning)

458
00:32:05,128 --> 00:32:09,358
(Monsters growling)

459
00:32:36,807 --> 00:32:39,328
Rumors from an invasion from the sea

460
00:32:39,328 --> 00:32:41,828
Took on a new dimension last night,

461
00:32:41,828 --> 00:32:45,468
When over 20 teenage girls
were brutally attacked

462
00:32:45,468 --> 00:32:47,743
And murdered during a slumber party.

463
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:51,854
A survivor described
these monsters differently

464
00:32:51,854 --> 00:32:53,674
From those which terrorized the beach

465
00:32:53,674 --> 00:32:55,774
Only a few days ago.

466
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:59,134
But Dr. Gavin, special
consultant for the Police,

467
00:32:59,134 --> 00:33:03,014
Suggested that these beings
probably have different forms,

468
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:06,564
In the same way that human
beings vary in size and shape.

469
00:33:07,254 --> 00:33:11,034
Meanwhile, specialists from
all over the United States

470
00:33:11,034 --> 00:33:14,554
Converged on our city in an attempt

471
00:33:14,554 --> 00:33:17,754
To piece together the
scattered reports of attacks

472
00:33:17,754 --> 00:33:20,653
In a massive effort to
find out the identity

473
00:33:20,653 --> 00:33:23,284
Of these strange creatures from the sea.

474
00:33:23,729 --> 00:33:26,754
[Paperboy] Extra,
extra, read all about it!

475
00:33:29,085 --> 00:33:32,374
Extra, extra, read all about it!

476
00:33:41,265 --> 00:33:42,105
[Voiceover] Thank you.

477
00:33:43,155 --> 00:33:44,170
[Voiceover] Thank you.

478
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,419
Listen, we better skip this town.

479
00:33:57,419 --> 00:33:59,760
This is place where they're
having all the trouble.

480
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,760
Cops?

481
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,260
No, murders, by the hundreds.

482
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,000
Some kind of monsters, killing people,

483
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,559
And drinking their blood.

484
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,479
Ewww, it give me the creeps.

485
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:11,714
Imagine being that thirsty.

486
00:34:12,404 --> 00:34:15,474
Oh, very funny, Miss Ghoul.

487
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,674
I read all about it in the papers.

488
00:34:17,674 --> 00:34:19,924
This town's too hot for my blood.

489
00:34:20,974 --> 00:34:22,284
Well you know what I mean.

490
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:24,993
Listen girls, I need some gas.

491
00:34:24,993 --> 00:34:27,843
We better stop and we'll
get some directions, too.

492
00:34:33,944 --> 00:34:38,044
(Brakes squeaking)

493
00:34:41,476 --> 00:34:42,274
Yes, ma'am.

494
00:34:42,274 --> 00:34:43,484
Can I help ya?

495
00:34:44,754 --> 00:34:46,344
He's cute, isn't he?

496
00:34:48,214 --> 00:34:49,644
Fill me up, huh.

497
00:34:50,274 --> 00:34:51,204
[Man] Sure.

498
00:34:56,714 --> 00:35:01,164
(Gas pump humming and dinging)

499
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,550
Say, what's this I hear
about all these murders

500
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,330
You've been having around here?

501
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,890
Oh yeah, it's a big deal.

502
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:30,690
They gotta big investigation going on now.

503
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:33,088
They got guys coming up here
from Washington and everything.

504
00:35:33,088 --> 00:35:35,008
Hey, we better get outta here, girls.

505
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,066
You aren't kidding.

506
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:37,744
Hey, handsome,

507
00:35:37,744 --> 00:35:39,906
What's the fastest way to get to New York?

508
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:44,150
Well I guess the best
way is to go down here

509
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,650
To Wiremill Road, and you turn left,

510
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,676
And go two blocks over, and uh,

511
00:35:49,706 --> 00:35:52,226
Then you turn right and
you go past the quarry,

512
00:35:52,226 --> 00:35:55,624
And uh, you'll see the throughway
right on the other side,

513
00:35:55,624 --> 00:35:56,502
You can't miss it.

514
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:58,952
Thanks, how much do I owe ya?

515
00:35:59,472 --> 00:36:01,142
That's four dollars, please.

516
00:36:03,572 --> 00:36:04,642
Thanks, honey.

517
00:36:05,292 --> 00:36:06,402
[Man] You're welcome.

518
00:36:16,688 --> 00:36:18,258
Turn left, turn left.

519
00:36:18,286 --> 00:36:19,826
Look at this route.

520
00:36:19,826 --> 00:36:21,066
I can't look, stupid.

521
00:36:21,066 --> 00:36:22,286
I'm driving.

522
00:36:22,286 --> 00:36:23,896
You wanna crack us up?

523
00:36:25,246 --> 00:36:28,796
(Engine humming)

524
00:36:29,922 --> 00:36:32,792
[Driver] Here we go, New York or bust.

525
00:36:33,282 --> 00:36:34,772
[Voiceover] (laughs) Oh, yeah.

526
00:36:40,718 --> 00:36:42,643
This is a road?

527
00:36:43,053 --> 00:36:47,283
(Tire hissing)

528
00:36:48,993 --> 00:36:51,804
Oh great, a flat tire.

529
00:36:57,689 --> 00:36:58,978
[Voiceover] Now what'll we do?

530
00:37:24,688 --> 00:37:25,729
Hey, where you been?

531
00:37:25,729 --> 00:37:27,258
Paul needs help with the wheel.

532
00:37:27,748 --> 00:37:29,468
Down by that quarry.

533
00:37:29,468 --> 00:37:31,658
Somethin' musta died in there.

534
00:37:31,989 --> 00:37:33,569
It smells like the food n' fish market

535
00:37:33,569 --> 00:37:35,338
In the middle of July.

536
00:37:35,373 --> 00:37:39,434
(Foreboding music)

537
00:37:43,484 --> 00:37:44,850
How's it goin', hun?

538
00:37:46,439 --> 00:37:49,060
Well I got it off,
but I can't see nothin'.

539
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,520
How 'bout some help.

540
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,340
Okay.

541
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:58,046
Hey, hold it, you two.

542
00:37:58,046 --> 00:37:59,805
What's with you?

543
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:02,455
I heard something.

544
00:38:02,455 --> 00:38:05,416
(Foreboding music)

545
00:38:06,845 --> 00:38:09,836
Oh, if it ain't money
rustlin', it ain't worth hearing.

546
00:38:10,305 --> 00:38:13,336
Shhh, hold it, I hear something, too.

547
00:38:19,325 --> 00:38:20,855
Sounds like somebody,

548
00:38:20,855 --> 00:38:23,426
Somebody big, walking in mud.

549
00:38:28,276 --> 00:38:30,821
You two flipped your wigs or somethin'?

550
00:38:53,461 --> 00:38:55,251
There's that fishy smell again.

551
00:39:02,501 --> 00:39:05,351
I think I'll go take a look around, girls.

552
00:39:12,382 --> 00:39:17,271
(Growling and screaming)

553
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:37,291
(Music box chiming)
(vacuum humming)

554
00:40:50,841 --> 00:40:54,121
I've had my share of the
misery, too, Miss Elaine,

555
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:55,736
And I know what it is.

556
00:40:56,567 --> 00:40:59,426
Three brothers and two sisters,

557
00:40:59,426 --> 00:41:01,016
All dead and gone.

558
00:41:01,347 --> 00:41:03,207
But you don't see me goin' around

559
00:41:03,207 --> 00:41:05,497
Moanin' and groanin' all day.

560
00:41:06,026 --> 00:41:09,141
I have my work, and the Lord has his,

561
00:41:09,141 --> 00:41:12,172
And he takes care of us, wherever we are.

562
00:41:13,642 --> 00:41:15,291
Why what's this, Eulabelle?

563
00:41:15,821 --> 00:41:16,742
Oh, that's mine.

564
00:41:16,742 --> 00:41:17,792
Give it to me.

565
00:41:18,501 --> 00:41:21,251
It's a voodoo doll, isn't it?

566
00:41:21,781 --> 00:41:23,331
You really believe in it.

567
00:41:24,321 --> 00:41:26,701
Now, don't you go teasing, Miss Elaine.

568
00:41:26,701 --> 00:41:29,371
I know a lot more things than I say.

569
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:34,091
Eulabelle, there's no
such thing as voodoo.

570
00:41:35,022 --> 00:41:36,212
Who is it anyway?

571
00:41:39,502 --> 00:41:41,411
One of them zombies.

572
00:41:42,701 --> 00:41:44,842
Dr. Gavin was so worried,

573
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:47,361
I thought I could help.

574
00:41:49,331 --> 00:41:51,341
Well, somebody's got to do something.

575
00:41:51,462 --> 00:41:52,732
(Doorbell chimes)

576
00:41:58,281 --> 00:41:59,406
Hello, Mr. Hank, come in.

577
00:41:59,406 --> 00:42:00,656
[Hank] Hello, Eulabelle.

578
00:42:03,326 --> 00:42:05,066
Here's that nice young boy,

579
00:42:05,066 --> 00:42:07,756
Just pining to take you out.

580
00:42:09,507 --> 00:42:11,126
Now, quit your moanin' and groanin'

581
00:42:11,126 --> 00:42:13,606
And go out and have some fun.

582
00:42:14,058 --> 00:42:16,517
Probably didn't need me
this afternoon, Elaine.

583
00:42:16,517 --> 00:42:18,670
Well, I thought, maybe you'd
like to go for a drive,

584
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,621
Or something.

585
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,585
Oh, I don't know, Hank.

586
00:42:22,585 --> 00:42:24,986
Now, go on upstairs and change.

587
00:42:24,986 --> 00:42:26,395
He'll wait.

588
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,630
[Hank] Look, I don't mind waiting.

589
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,900
You go ahead and change.

590
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:35,720
All right.

591
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:40,940
(Engine humming)

592
00:42:49,446 --> 00:42:52,076
Why did you come back
to the beach, Hank?

593
00:42:53,086 --> 00:42:54,832
I don't know, Elaine.

594
00:42:55,642 --> 00:42:57,872
I had a funny feeling about this place.

595
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:00,652
Come on, let's go.

596
00:43:13,872 --> 00:43:18,262
(People chattering)

597
00:43:28,344 --> 00:43:29,904
Hey man, what's happenin'?

598
00:43:29,904 --> 00:43:31,504
How ya doing, gang?

599
00:43:31,504 --> 00:43:33,284
Pretty dead tonight, huh Ron?

600
00:43:33,284 --> 00:43:35,364
Yeah, ever since Tina got killed

601
00:43:35,364 --> 00:43:37,384
Like, no action around here.

602
00:43:37,384 --> 00:43:40,294
Yeah, well, it'll pick up.

603
00:43:41,904 --> 00:43:43,254
[Both] Take it easy.

604
00:43:57,204 --> 00:43:59,114
Ron, what are you gonna play?

605
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,718
What'd you like to hear, Elaine?

606
00:44:00,718 --> 00:44:02,518
How 'bout, mmmm,

607
00:44:02,518 --> 00:44:03,814
You're not a Summer Love?

608
00:44:03,814 --> 00:44:05,524
Mmm, just for you, baby.

609
00:44:07,588 --> 00:44:08,598
Hi.

610
00:44:09,228 --> 00:44:10,344
Excuse me, Hank.

611
00:44:10,344 --> 00:44:11,654
Sure, go ahead.

612
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:18,834
♫ Summer love, summer love

613
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:24,514
♫ Summer love, summer love

614
00:44:25,724 --> 00:44:30,444

615
00:44:31,476 --> 00:44:34,906

00:44:55,311 --> 00:44:58,471
♫ That you will be, endlessly

622
00:44:58,471 --> 00:45:00,291
♫ Close to me

623
00:45:00,291 --> 00:45:04,911
♫ Like the sand and the sea

624
00:45:06,491 --> 00:45:08,432
♫ Summer love, summer love

625
00:45:08,432 --> 00:45:10,991

650

(Crickets chirping)

651
00:46:33,846 --> 00:46:34,746
Goodnight, girls.

652
00:46:34,746 --> 00:46:35,706
Now you go straight home.

653
00:46:35,706 --> 00:46:37,526
My brother's coming to pick us up.

654
00:46:37,526 --> 00:46:38,346
Good night, now.

655
00:46:38,346 --> 00:46:39,814
[Girls] Goodnight, Johnny.

656
00:46:49,294 --> 00:46:53,558
(Foreboding music)

657
00:46:59,178 --> 00:47:01,518
He's not coming, let's walk.

658
00:47:06,748 --> 00:47:07,858
[Voiceover] No I think the...

659
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:08,678
[Voiceover] Where'd you get that?

660
00:47:08,678 --> 00:47:10,946
[Voiceover] No I think that
pink would be well for her,

661
00:47:10,946 --> 00:47:12,966
But it's not always the best color.

662
00:47:12,966 --> 00:47:14,866
Not which I love it, to think about,

663
00:47:14,866 --> 00:47:16,206
But what can you do?

664
00:47:19,356 --> 00:47:20,064
[Voiceover] No I like him

665
00:47:20,064 --> 00:47:21,324
But he's not the greatest
thing in the world.

666
00:47:21,324 --> 00:47:22,501
[Voiceover] Cold

667
00:47:22,874 --> 00:47:23,881
[Voiceover] No, well, he's not.

668
00:47:24,071 --> 00:47:26,091
[Voiceover] Yeah, but my mother took it,

669
00:47:26,091 --> 00:47:27,371
Well I knew a guy who did that

670
00:47:27,371 --> 00:47:28,892
But it didn't do any good at all

671
00:47:28,892 --> 00:47:29,751
[Voiceover] You got a cat?

672
00:47:29,751 --> 00:47:31,801
[Voiceover] And it was much easier.

673
00:47:34,637 --> 00:47:35,738
(Horn honking)

674
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:39,738
Come on, girls.

675
00:47:49,268 --> 00:47:52,718
(Monster growling)

676
00:47:52,718 --> 00:47:56,319
(Foreboding music)

677
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:00,494
(Static hissing)

678
00:48:04,064 --> 00:48:07,954
(Intense, chaotic music)

679
00:48:13,684 --> 00:48:17,834
(Glass shattering)

680
00:48:17,834 --> 00:48:19,710
(Monster groaning)

681
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,671
[Elaine] It's still alive.

682
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,280
I wanna make some notes.

683
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,160
Yes, sir.

684
00:48:45,428 --> 00:48:47,658
April 10th, 7pm.

685
00:48:48,128 --> 00:48:50,118
Notes on possible malignant organism.

686
00:48:51,308 --> 00:48:54,308
Overall configuration,
that of a human arm,

687
00:48:54,308 --> 00:48:56,798
Severed just below the elbow joint.

688
00:48:57,108 --> 00:49:00,024
Muscle tissue seems to be a sea anemone,

689
00:49:00,024 --> 00:49:01,554
Species of protozoa.

690
00:49:02,484 --> 00:49:04,444
These organs are exactly
like human organs,

691
00:49:04,444 --> 00:49:06,972
Except for they have been
replaced by the protozoans.

692
00:49:07,462 --> 00:49:11,382
Of course, this creature
needs the ordinary necessities

693
00:49:11,382 --> 00:49:12,802
Of human life.

694
00:49:12,802 --> 00:49:14,912
Proteins, fats, sugars, and so forth.

695
00:49:16,462 --> 00:49:18,722
But since his organs are so decomposed

696
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:20,462
That they can neither produce nor retain

697
00:49:20,462 --> 00:49:22,822
The oxygen necessary for its survival,

698
00:49:22,822 --> 00:49:25,192
It needs the only food
which can keep it alive.

699
00:49:26,382 --> 00:49:27,632
Blood?

700
00:49:27,902 --> 00:49:29,072
Human blood.

701
00:49:30,022 --> 00:49:32,602
If a human body, a drowned person,

702
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:34,262
Were attacked by tiny sea plants,

703
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:36,462
Which became parasites and completely...

704
00:49:36,462 --> 00:49:37,342
Dead?

705
00:49:37,342 --> 00:49:39,082
No, he's still alive.

706
00:49:39,082 --> 00:49:40,844
But it's changed into a...

707
00:49:42,178 --> 00:49:44,172
Well, is it a plant or an animal?

708
00:49:44,172 --> 00:49:45,582
It's both?

709
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:47,222
It's a giant protozoa.

710
00:49:47,692 --> 00:49:51,242
Dr. Gavin, can they be killed?

711
00:49:53,512 --> 00:49:54,782
I don't know, Lieutenant.

712
00:49:56,092 --> 00:49:57,522
They are the living dead.

713
00:49:58,232 --> 00:49:59,422
They're zombies

714
00:50:00,152 --> 00:50:01,992
Nothing so dramatic as that, Elaine.

715
00:50:01,992 --> 00:50:03,632
They're more like a jelly fish.

716
00:50:03,632 --> 00:50:05,872
You can't kill 'em by shooting
them or cutting them up.

717
00:50:05,872 --> 00:50:07,882
Well, then how can you kill them?

718
00:50:08,492 --> 00:50:09,330
Shhh.

719
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:13,698
(Foreboding music)

720
00:50:13,698 --> 00:50:15,356
I hear something.

721
00:50:31,516 --> 00:50:33,300
There's something out there.

722
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,378
I know there is.

723
00:50:34,378 --> 00:50:36,926
All right now everybody
just keep calm and be quiet.

724
00:50:38,316 --> 00:50:39,596
The gun won't help you.

725
00:50:39,596 --> 00:50:40,954
Here, take these knives.

726
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:42,524
They're all we have.

727
00:50:43,614 --> 00:50:45,044
Elaine, over there in that corner.

728
00:50:46,634 --> 00:50:49,004
Lieutenant when I say,
"lights," turn them on.

729
00:50:49,272 --> 00:50:50,582
I'll take care of this one.

730
00:51:13,494 --> 00:51:14,674
Lights!

731
00:51:16,424 --> 00:51:17,794
Eulabelle!

732
00:51:17,964 --> 00:51:18,894
Oh, (laughs)

733
00:51:19,464 --> 00:51:20,544
What are all of you doin'

734
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:22,594
Sneakin' and peakin' in the dark.

735
00:51:23,624 --> 00:51:25,394
I'm afraid you gave us quite a scare.

736
00:51:25,924 --> 00:51:27,694
Oh, I'm sorry Dr. Gavin.

737
00:51:29,364 --> 00:51:32,614
But it so quiet up there in the house.

738
00:51:34,384 --> 00:51:38,854
And I get scared by myself,
all alone, at night.

739
00:51:40,044 --> 00:51:43,124
And them zombies they
coming at me tonight.

740
00:51:44,089 --> 00:51:46,119
I just know they will.

741
00:51:47,429 --> 00:51:49,019
(Screaming)

742
00:51:49,124 --> 00:51:53,284
(Specimen popping and hissing)

743
00:52:04,134 --> 00:52:05,299
Look it's burning up.

744
00:52:06,269 --> 00:52:07,599
Eulabelle you've killed it.

745
00:52:07,604 --> 00:52:10,519
Oh, Dr. Gavin, I'm
sorry, I didn't mean...

746
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:12,974
Don't be sorry, this is wonderful.

747
00:52:12,974 --> 00:52:16,154
You've discovered a way to
destroy these creatures.

748
00:52:16,154 --> 00:52:18,764
Oh, Lord, Lord.

749
00:52:19,494 --> 00:52:21,784
Look, completely dehydrated.

750
00:52:22,114 --> 00:52:23,954
Protozoans are almost all water.

751
00:52:23,954 --> 00:52:25,924
This is all we have left.

752
00:52:26,454 --> 00:52:28,644
But what makes all the
smoke and steam, Daddy?

753
00:52:28,934 --> 00:52:30,014
Sodium.

754
00:52:30,014 --> 00:52:31,344
Plain old sodium.

755
00:52:31,594 --> 00:52:33,514
Hank, you remember your chemistry.

756
00:52:33,514 --> 00:52:35,574
Sodium is a very unstable metal

757
00:52:35,574 --> 00:52:37,229
That reacts violently with water.

758
00:52:37,229 --> 00:52:38,129
That's right.

759
00:52:38,129 --> 00:52:41,109
Then they can be killed, with sodium.

760
00:52:41,109 --> 00:52:43,759
They can, if we can find them.

761
00:52:43,888 --> 00:52:48,618
(Muffled upbeat music)

762
00:52:49,964 --> 00:52:51,538
Same to you, fella!

763
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:53,850
What about that guy, huh?

764
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,050
We are unwanted.

765
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,294
Outcasts.

766
00:53:04,294 --> 00:53:06,440
Orphan of the storm.

767
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:08,720
What storm?

768
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:11,480
The storm of my soul.

769
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:14,200
Right.

770
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:30,280
Where do we go now?

771
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:32,160
We'll drive

772
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:34,900
Are you cape-ab-able of driving?

773
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:37,648
Of course I'm cape-ab-able.

774
00:53:37,648 --> 00:53:39,386
Are you cape-ab-able.

775
00:53:39,386 --> 00:53:41,176
Of course, I am.

776
00:53:41,644 --> 00:53:42,934
Where's the car.

777
00:53:43,824 --> 00:53:45,134
That a way.

778
00:53:46,944 --> 00:53:48,264
(Men drunkenly whooping)

779
00:53:48,264 --> 00:53:49,244
I'll get my car.

780
00:53:49,244 --> 00:53:51,474
Yeah, you wait here, I'll get my car.

781
00:54:06,184 --> 00:54:10,474
(Engine revving)

782
00:54:20,884 --> 00:54:23,734
(Metal crunching)

783
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,170
Hey, buddy.

784
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,606
I guess weren't cape-ab-ab-able.

785
00:54:35,714 --> 00:54:40,404
(Hysterical laughing)

786
00:54:47,954 --> 00:54:49,224
Let's walk.

787
00:54:50,094 --> 00:54:51,450
Hey, lead the way.

788
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:55,340
(Hysterical laughing)

789
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:58,006
Woowee!

790
00:54:58,006 --> 00:54:58,766
Hey.

791
00:54:58,766 --> 00:54:59,210
Yeah.

792
00:54:59,986 --> 00:55:01,408
What's that sound?

793
00:55:03,718 --> 00:55:05,608
(Laughter) It's you.

794
00:55:06,518 --> 00:55:07,988
No, it's you.

795
00:55:08,778 --> 00:55:12,836
(Foreboding music)

796
00:55:12,836 --> 00:55:14,306
Let's hear you walk.

797
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:20,466
No, it's not you.

798
00:55:20,856 --> 00:55:22,066
Now you walk.

799
00:55:24,776 --> 00:55:25,946
It's not you either.

800
00:55:29,896 --> 00:55:31,066
Hey.

801
00:55:34,476 --> 00:55:35,766
What's it sound like?

802
00:55:36,896 --> 00:55:41,206
It sounds like somebody in rubbers,

803
00:55:41,556 --> 00:55:42,686
Filled with water.

804
00:55:43,376 --> 00:55:44,474
You wearin' rubbers?

805
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:45,294
No.

806
00:55:45,294 --> 00:55:46,804
Me neither.

807
00:55:47,814 --> 00:55:50,014
It's probably, probably somebody

808
00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:51,994
Came from the swimming pool,

809
00:55:51,994 --> 00:55:54,254
And came from swimming with their,

810
00:55:54,254 --> 00:55:56,104
With their shoes and socks on.

811
00:55:56,212 --> 00:55:58,290
(Laughing)

812
00:55:58,290 --> 00:55:59,610
That's not so funny.

813
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:02,270
It's probably some old drunk.

814
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:03,790
God, I hate drunks.

815
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:05,210
Hey Stan, look.

816
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:05,936
Truck.

817
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,262
They left their lights on.

818
00:56:10,262 --> 00:56:11,412
Yeah.

819
00:56:12,022 --> 00:56:13,280
Well, we better go turn 'em off.

820
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,790
Yeah, save his battery,
for heaven's sake.

821
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:24,570
Hey, Stan, there's a guy in here.

822
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,910
(Laughing)

823
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,450
Hey buddy.

824
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,470
(Laughs) What are you doing, sleeping?

825
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:40,326
Oh, buddy.

826
00:56:42,076 --> 00:56:43,786
(Laughing)

827
00:56:44,354 --> 00:56:46,844
Hey, hey, hey, buddy, buddy.

828
00:56:46,844 --> 00:56:50,474
(Intense, chaotic music)

829
00:56:50,682 --> 00:56:51,732
Stan.

830
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:54,912
Hey Stan, this guy ain't got no face.

831
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:57,990
Hey, Stan!

832
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,150
Hey Stan, where are ya?

833
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:07,710
Hey Stan!

834
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,510
Stan, don't play these
games on me like this.

835
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:18,340
Stan!

836
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:26,453
Hey, don't eat me!

837
00:57:28,185 --> 00:57:31,315
(Crying)

838
00:57:33,765 --> 00:57:37,355
(Monsters growling)

839
00:57:42,265 --> 00:57:45,063
(Man gurgling)

840
00:57:45,063 --> 00:57:46,943
Because of this recent discovery,

841
00:57:46,943 --> 00:57:50,003
The police now feel certain
that in a very short time,

842
00:57:50,003 --> 00:57:52,763
A method will be found
to locate and destroy

843
00:57:52,763 --> 00:57:54,693
These frightful monsters.

844
00:57:55,383 --> 00:57:57,033
Extra, extra read all about it!

845
00:57:58,543 --> 00:58:03,133
(Woman screaming)
(monster growling)

846
00:58:53,159 --> 00:58:56,729
(Siren wailing)

847
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:01,309
[Hank] Dr. Gavin, look.

848
00:59:04,619 --> 00:59:08,927
(Static crackling)

849
00:59:11,077 --> 00:59:12,207
Scale 15

850
00:59:14,977 --> 00:59:17,367
The water from that arm is radioactive.

851
00:59:18,097 --> 00:59:20,495
That means the cells
themselves are radiated.

852
00:59:20,495 --> 00:59:21,585
But how?

853
00:59:24,315 --> 00:59:25,629
Floating pig.

854
00:59:25,629 --> 00:59:26,865
The what?

855
00:59:26,865 --> 00:59:28,065
Oh, the floating pig,

856
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:29,235
That's what we call the garbage scow

857
00:59:29,235 --> 00:59:30,615
That leaves the harbor every week.

858
00:59:30,865 --> 00:59:32,325
You see it's been dumping,

859
00:59:32,325 --> 00:59:35,031
Waste material from the
reactor at the University.

860
00:59:35,441 --> 00:59:36,607
Do you know where they dump?

861
00:59:38,277 --> 00:59:40,497
See a friend of mine
says he saw them once out

862
00:59:40,497 --> 00:59:42,735
At Western Island, I believe.

863
00:59:42,735 --> 00:59:45,505
Western Island, Western Island.

864
00:59:47,135 --> 00:59:48,255
There it is.

865
00:59:48,255 --> 00:59:49,615
Look at these currents, Hank.

866
00:59:49,615 --> 00:59:52,195
If one of those containers sprung a leak,

867
00:59:52,195 --> 00:59:54,415
The waste would be drawn
right by our shore,

868
00:59:54,415 --> 00:59:56,725
And that's where Tina was
killed that first night.

869
00:59:57,035 --> 00:59:58,931
Western Island is also where
that fishing boat went down

870
00:59:58,931 --> 01:00:00,437
Just a few weeks ago.

871
01:00:01,227 --> 01:00:02,687
These creatures are human bodies,

872
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:04,765
Kept alive by radioactive decay.

873
01:00:04,765 --> 01:00:07,655
So, wherever they go they
leave radioactive water.

874
01:00:08,485 --> 01:00:10,045
So all we have to do is to test the water

875
01:00:10,045 --> 01:00:11,625
To know where they've been.

876
01:00:11,625 --> 01:00:14,025
Right, then we can tell where they are.

877
01:00:14,025 --> 01:00:15,845
At this minute, wherever they are,

878
01:00:15,845 --> 01:00:17,377
They're building up a small, and harmless,

879
01:00:17,377 --> 01:00:19,837
Radioactive residue in
the surrounding water.

880
01:00:19,837 --> 01:00:22,057
Our geiger counters will
give a scale 15 reaction

881
01:00:22,057 --> 01:00:22,957
To that water, so...

882
01:00:22,957 --> 01:00:25,077
So, what we have to do
is just test all the water

883
01:00:25,077 --> 01:00:26,237
In the immediate area,

884
01:00:26,237 --> 01:00:27,857
And if they're in one of those lakes,

885
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:30,155
Well, we'll get a scale reading
from the counter, right?

886
01:00:30,155 --> 01:00:30,673
Right!

887
01:00:30,673 --> 01:00:32,029
I'll call the police.

888
01:00:32,029 --> 01:00:33,229
We'll organize and get all the people

889
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:34,729
In the countryside to help us.

890
01:00:34,729 --> 01:00:36,169
Then all we have to do is find them,

891
01:00:36,169 --> 01:00:37,329
And sodium will kill them.

892
01:00:37,329 --> 01:00:38,617
All right, Dr. Gavin.

893
01:00:39,847 --> 01:00:42,647
Say, Dr. Gavin we don't
know how many there are.

894
01:00:42,647 --> 01:00:44,837
We might need tons of it.

895
01:00:45,187 --> 01:00:45,887
You get on the phone

896
01:00:45,887 --> 01:00:48,197
And call every chemical
supply company in the area.

897
01:00:48,327 --> 01:00:50,177
Someone must carry sodium
in large quantities.

898
01:00:50,707 --> 01:00:52,737
I'll call Lieutenant Wells
and get this thing started.

899
01:00:53,047 --> 01:00:55,087
If we're quick, we may stop these monsters

900
01:00:55,087 --> 01:00:56,577
Before another night of killing.

901
01:00:56,707 --> 01:00:57,977
Right, Dr. Gavin.

902
01:01:10,181 --> 01:01:11,651
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

903
01:01:13,361 --> 01:01:16,907
Now these are instructions
and map coordinates.

904
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:20,107
Break up into separate teams.

905
01:01:20,877 --> 01:01:25,707
Each team is to organize a
search in that specific area.

906
01:01:27,197 --> 01:01:29,307
There are a limited
number of geiger counters,

907
01:01:29,307 --> 01:01:30,957
But more are being
brought up from New York,

908
01:01:30,957 --> 01:01:32,017
So don't worry about it,

909
01:01:32,017 --> 01:01:33,757
You'll have them by the
end of the afternoon.

910
01:01:36,347 --> 01:01:39,537
I want you to find every single
body of water in your area.

911
01:01:40,567 --> 01:01:42,337
And be sure it's tested.

912
01:01:42,927 --> 01:01:45,177
You've got to be sure that
those things haven't been there.

913
01:01:45,983 --> 01:01:47,433
Let's get going.

914
01:01:47,561 --> 01:01:52,291
(Exciting, lively music)

915
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:24,405
(Water trickling)

916
01:02:29,852 --> 01:02:31,322
[Eulabelle] How's it going, Mr. Hank?

917
01:02:31,632 --> 01:02:32,953
Oh, it's no use, Eulabelle.

918
01:02:32,953 --> 01:02:34,482
Nobody has any sodium.

919
01:02:34,482 --> 01:02:35,887
They all get their
supply from special order

920
01:02:35,887 --> 01:02:37,382
From New York City.

921
01:02:37,382 --> 01:02:39,342
Did you try everybody
in the telephone book?

922
01:02:39,342 --> 01:02:41,182
Yeah, almost, all but a couple.

923
01:02:41,182 --> 01:02:43,202
Well you try that couple.

924
01:02:43,202 --> 01:02:45,487
You've got to try, Mr. Hank.

925
01:02:46,117 --> 01:02:47,132
Well, go on!

926
01:02:47,132 --> 01:02:48,307
All right, Eulabelle.

927
01:02:48,307 --> 01:02:50,177
I'll call New York City.

928
01:02:53,507 --> 01:02:56,427
Hello Operator, would
you please get the uh,

929
01:02:56,427 --> 01:02:59,577
Manhattan Chemical Supply
Company in New York City.

930
01:03:00,787 --> 01:03:01,737
That's right.

931
01:03:03,977 --> 01:03:04,947
Hello.

932
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,497
Listen, do you carry any sodium?

933
01:03:07,967 --> 01:03:09,317
That's right, the metal.

934
01:03:10,167 --> 01:03:11,197
You do?

935
01:03:11,507 --> 01:03:13,757
Well, listen, do you have a lot of it?

936
01:03:15,327 --> 01:03:17,237
Well, will you hang onto it for me?

937
01:03:17,947 --> 01:03:19,217
Hank Green.

938
01:03:19,867 --> 01:03:21,097
Yeah, that's right

939
01:03:21,927 --> 01:03:23,557
All right, I'll be there in about an hour.

940
01:03:23,557 --> 01:03:28,168
(Jazzy rock music)

941
01:04:28,257 --> 01:04:30,017
[Eulabelle] Oh, afternoon, Dr. Gavin.

942
01:04:30,017 --> 01:04:30,673
Afternoon.

943
01:04:30,673 --> 01:04:32,877
I saw ya coming so I
brought ya some coffee.

944
01:04:32,877 --> 01:04:34,123
Oh, good, thank you.

945
01:04:36,213 --> 01:04:39,084
Any luck with your
water testing, Dr. Gavin?

946
01:04:39,893 --> 01:04:41,163
Absolutely no luck.

947
01:04:41,873 --> 01:04:44,783
I must've tested at least 10
places and didn't find a thing.

948
01:04:45,553 --> 01:04:48,784
Well, Mr. Hank found that
chemical, whatchya call it.

949
01:04:49,333 --> 01:04:50,268
[Dr. Gavin] Oh, good.

950
01:04:50,268 --> 01:04:52,508
And he's gone on to New York to get it,

951
01:04:52,508 --> 01:04:54,478
But he won't get back before dark.

952
01:04:55,248 --> 01:04:56,699
And Elaine, where's Elaine?

953
01:04:57,169 --> 01:04:59,693
Well, she's gone on too, Dr. Gavin.

954
01:05:01,043 --> 01:05:04,873
I think she mentioned Fingle's Quarry.

955
01:05:05,643 --> 01:05:06,614
Fingle's quarry?

956
01:05:06,658 --> 01:05:07,523
Yes, sir.

957
01:05:08,713 --> 01:05:11,088
Good God, why didn't I this before.

958
01:05:11,088 --> 01:05:12,668
That's the deepest body
of water around here.

959
01:05:12,668 --> 01:05:14,384
And it's right where those
three girls were killed.

960
01:05:14,384 --> 01:05:15,353
Oh.

961
01:05:17,223 --> 01:05:18,123
When Hank gets here,

962
01:05:18,123 --> 01:05:19,603
Tell him I've gone to Fingle's quarry.

963
01:05:19,603 --> 01:05:20,643
Yes, sir.

964
01:05:20,643 --> 01:05:22,643
And call the police, and
tell them to meet me there.

965
01:05:22,643 --> 01:05:23,993
Yes, sir.

966
01:05:37,763 --> 01:05:42,314

He is coming east on route 104

975
01:07:04,503 --> 01:07:08,093
In gray MG and proceed
to Fingle's quarry, over.

976

986
01:08:06,213 --> 01:08:07,723

Hello Eulabelle.

1016
01:15:35,985 --> 01:15:38,535
Say is Miss Elaine receiving today?

1017
01:15:39,163 --> 01:15:41,183
I think she's asleep.

1018
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,649
Let's check.

1019
01:15:42,697 --> 01:15:43,887
All right.

1020
01:15:53,739 --> 01:15:56,077

With the assistance of Dr. Richard Gavin,

1024
01:16:01,737 --> 01:16:04,717
Located the hiding place of

Hello, darling.

Oh, it's much better.

1032
01:16:18,573 --> 01:16:20,073
I just saw your father,
