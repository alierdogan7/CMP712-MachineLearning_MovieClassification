1
00:02:40,248 --> 00:02:42,148
Ah, Lutz, my friend.

2
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,411
I must remind you once again,
Herr Professor,

3
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:45,619
I am not your friend.

4
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,120
Aha, but I am yours.

5
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,924
You're a lucky fellow, Lutzy.

6
00:02:50,025 --> 00:02:51,720
My name is Lutz,

7
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,822
and as usual Professor Juttner,
you will be late.

8
00:02:55,364 --> 00:02:57,127
What can his highness
learn from you?

9
00:02:57,232 --> 00:02:59,132
A teacher
and you can't even tell time.

10
00:02:59,234 --> 00:03:01,395
Small minds
stick with the clock.

11
00:03:01,503 --> 00:03:03,494
His highness is always punctual.

12
00:03:03,605 --> 00:03:05,630
That's
what I've been trying to do,

13
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:07,265
educate him out of it.

14
00:03:13,482 --> 00:03:15,507
I don't know
why I bother with you.

15
00:03:15,617 --> 00:03:17,642
It's your duty, Lutzy my lad.

16
00:03:17,753 --> 00:03:19,618
I only do it
to please his highness.

17
00:03:20,288 --> 00:03:22,051
His highness'
very words to me were

18
00:03:22,157 --> 00:03:24,091
"I should esteem it a favor,
my dear Lutz,

19
00:03:24,192 --> 00:03:26,660
if you could make the professor
look more presentable. "

20
00:03:26,762 --> 00:03:27,895
And I said,

21
00:03:27,896 --> 00:03:29,921
I should esteem it an honor,
your highness.

22
00:03:30,032 --> 00:03:31,897
Every man is entitled
to his honor.

23
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,934
Oh, we're late!

24
00:04:25,754 --> 00:04:28,655
A most appropriate sermon
considering the day.

25
00:04:28,757 --> 00:04:30,691
Thank you, your majesty.

26
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:32,692
Permit me to congratulate
your royal highness

27
00:04:32,794 --> 00:04:34,557
on your forthcoming betrothal.

28
00:04:34,663 --> 00:04:36,063
And may I include good wishes

29
00:04:36,064 --> 00:04:38,259
for Princess Johanna
of North Hausen.

30
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:39,366
Thank you.

31
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:40,334
She will be here tomorrow

32
00:04:40,335 --> 00:04:42,394
and you can extend them
to her in person.

33
00:04:42,504 --> 00:04:44,734
She is as gracious as
she is beautiful.

34
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,037
This marriage has truly
been planned in heaven.

35
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,478
Our prime minister
is too modest.

36
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,080
Von Mark planned it years ago

37
00:04:53,115 --> 00:04:55,379
when the princess and I
was still children.

38
00:04:55,484 --> 00:04:57,884
Of course with your blessings,
grandfather.

39
00:04:57,986 --> 00:05:00,147
Should your royal highness
feel the need of

40
00:05:00,255 --> 00:05:02,519
spiritual guidance and comfort,

41
00:05:02,624 --> 00:05:04,285
I am at your command.

42
00:05:04,392 --> 00:05:06,451
My guidance and comfort have
always been the knowledge

43
00:05:06,561 --> 00:05:08,893
that I am doing my duty
for Karlsburg.

44
00:05:23,345 --> 00:05:24,812
Well, Karl.

45
00:05:24,813 --> 00:05:28,271
I have taken cared of
all the preliminaries,

46
00:05:28,383 --> 00:05:31,978
but victory or defeat
is in your hands.

47
00:05:32,087 --> 00:05:35,147
Tomorrow may well decide
the future of our country.

48
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:37,783
So when you
propose to the princess,

49
00:05:37,893 --> 00:05:41,488
I count on you to carry it out
with your usual efficiency.

50
00:05:41,596 --> 00:05:43,096
It won't be too difficult.

51
00:05:43,165 --> 00:05:45,429
From her pictures,
she seems very attractive.

52
00:05:46,234 --> 00:05:48,725
And in a receptive mood.
Why not?

53
00:05:48,837 --> 00:05:51,533
It is true they have the money
but we have the blood.

54
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,165
They are merchants,
we are kings.

55
00:05:54,276 --> 00:05:56,369
Oh, I should have worked
that subject, my boy.

56
00:05:56,478 --> 00:05:57,978
She can afford to be fussy.

57
00:05:57,979 --> 00:05:59,446
Don't worry, grandfather.

58
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:00,947
For such a dowry,

59
00:06:01,016 --> 00:06:03,246
I'd marry a princess
with two heads.

60
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:05,148
Then I need scarcely remind you

61
00:06:05,253 --> 00:06:07,016
that our treasury is empty.

62
00:06:07,122 --> 00:06:09,818
Our treasury has been empty
for 200 years.

63
00:06:09,925 --> 00:06:12,223
Yet somehow we have survived.

64
00:06:12,327 --> 00:06:14,227
We have survived
when other thrones have fallen

65
00:06:14,329 --> 00:06:15,729
not because we have been rich,

66
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,425
but because the men
of our family

67
00:06:17,532 --> 00:06:20,729
have always been
extremely eligible.

68
00:06:21,403 --> 00:06:25,134
Our code of arms reminds us
our wealth has been our sons.

69
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,538
Sir, when I hold her in my arms,

70
00:06:27,642 --> 00:06:30,110
I will do my best for Karlsburg.

71
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:36,683
Her royal highness, the princess
Johanna of North Hausen.

72
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:35,109
You know, Ferddie,

73
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:38,773
I believe Karl is even better
looking than you were at his age

74
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,281
Not at all.

75
00:07:40,282 --> 00:07:41,448
My dear, Mathilde,

76
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:44,475
it's just that time
has dimmed your memory.

77
00:07:46,021 --> 00:07:47,221
Perhaps.

78
00:07:47,222 --> 00:07:50,885
But at any rate, they'd make
a very handsome couple.

79
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:54,450
I can already see
their profiles on the coin.

80
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:01,463
Mother is very impressed with
the troop maneuvers today.

81
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:02,803
I'm pleased to hear it.

82
00:08:02,804 --> 00:08:04,499
And what did you think of it?

83
00:08:04,706 --> 00:08:05,673
After all these years,

84
00:08:05,674 --> 00:08:08,370
I still think parades
are great fun, don't you?

85
00:08:08,476 --> 00:08:09,976
Fun, Johanna?

86
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:11,774
Training our troops
is my responsibility,

87
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,110
and I assure it's
the hardest kind of work.

88
00:08:14,215 --> 00:08:15,910
One can't ever let up.

89
00:08:16,017 --> 00:08:17,484
I think...

90
00:08:17,485 --> 00:08:19,680
that doesn't leave much time
for relaxation

91
00:08:19,788 --> 00:08:21,779
or for dances like this,
does it?

92
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,390
Very little.

93
00:08:23,892 --> 00:08:26,190
Why? Does my dancing show it?

94
00:08:27,262 --> 00:08:30,060
Your highness dances
with firmness and precision.

95
00:08:30,165 --> 00:08:32,360
But the throne of Karlsburg
won't fall

96
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:34,662
if you loosen your knees a bit.

97
00:08:36,371 --> 00:08:37,571
Forgive me.

98
00:08:37,572 --> 00:08:39,006
I've always considered
the parade ground

99
00:08:39,007 --> 00:08:40,374
more important
than the dance floor.

100
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:41,775
perhaps,
one of my junior officer...

101
00:08:41,776 --> 00:08:42,876
Everyone is looking at us.

102
00:08:42,877 --> 00:08:45,744
I didn't come to Karlsburg
to find a dancing partner.

103
00:08:45,847 --> 00:08:48,645
Why don't you invite me to see
the view from the garden?

104
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:59,486
Here now, this is much better.

105
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:02,159
No one is looking at us.

106
00:09:02,263 --> 00:09:04,731
So perhaps we can at last
look at each other.

107
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,400
It's almost time for us

108
00:09:06,401 --> 00:09:08,665
to receive the diplomatic corps
of both kingdoms.

109
00:09:09,537 --> 00:09:10,537
Let them wait.

110
00:09:10,538 --> 00:09:13,166
We owe ourselves
a little time together.

111
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,609
Surely we'll have plenty
of opportunity in the future.

112
00:09:17,312 --> 00:09:19,746
I don't consider marriage
an introduction.

113
00:09:20,915 --> 00:09:23,008
Aren't you curious to know
what kind of a person

114
00:09:23,118 --> 00:09:25,450
you will spend
the rest of your life with?

115
00:09:25,553 --> 00:09:27,053
I confess I am.

116
00:09:27,155 --> 00:09:28,355
Oh, you needn't be?

117
00:09:28,356 --> 00:09:31,348
I shall be a most punctilious
and considerate husband.

118
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:33,154
Karl, come here.

119
00:09:36,798 --> 00:09:38,493
Look at me.

120
00:09:39,834 --> 00:09:43,167
Forget your princely
self-possession for a moment.

121
00:09:43,271 --> 00:09:46,900
I'm sure that even the
great warrior, Frederick the...

122
00:09:47,008 --> 00:09:49,169
What's his name?
Frederick The Bold.

123
00:09:49,277 --> 00:09:51,643
Even he must have had time
for other things.

124
00:09:51,746 --> 00:09:54,237
After all,
he did found the dynasty.

125
00:09:57,619 --> 00:09:59,246
We're quite alone.

126
00:10:02,891 --> 00:10:05,052
Quite alone.

127
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,390
I hope I misjudge your highness.

128
00:10:07,495 --> 00:10:09,895
I cannot assume that
the future queen of Karlsburg

129
00:10:09,998 --> 00:10:11,966
wishes to be treated
like the ordinary woman,

130
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:13,761
one in contrast on maneuvers.

131
00:10:13,868 --> 00:10:16,860
Oh, then you have
encountered other women?

132
00:10:16,971 --> 00:10:18,272
What a question?

133
00:10:18,273 --> 00:10:19,968
But that's no answer.

134
00:10:20,074 --> 00:10:23,271
Very well,
I have on many occassions.

135
00:10:23,378 --> 00:10:25,573
I find it hard to believe it.

136
00:10:27,515 --> 00:10:29,540
Perhaps I can convince you.

137
00:10:37,392 --> 00:10:38,950
Well?

138
00:10:39,828 --> 00:10:43,059
Typically Karlsburg,
well-trained and precise.

139
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:46,160
Your arms are very strong, Karl.

140
00:10:46,267 --> 00:10:48,667
But your heart
doesn't beat any faster.

141
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,432
You are a king first,
last and always

142
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:53,268
and you never forget it.

143
00:10:54,042 --> 00:10:55,542
You complement me.

144
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:58,044
I don't mean to. Kings bore me.

145
00:10:58,146 --> 00:11:00,546
Prussian virtues are impressive,

146
00:11:00,648 --> 00:11:03,344
but cold comfort aren't
on a long winter's night.

147
00:11:13,228 --> 00:11:14,661
Some coffee?
No, thank you.

148
00:11:14,662 --> 00:11:16,459
You've ruined my sleep as it is.

149
00:11:16,564 --> 00:11:19,692
My dear, Ferddie, I am merely
giving you an honest opinion.

150
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:22,201
You asked me to find out
and I'm telling you.

151
00:11:22,303 --> 00:11:23,803
Karl won't do.

152
00:11:23,805 --> 00:11:25,272
Just what does she expect?

153
00:11:25,273 --> 00:11:27,673
A human being,
not a Prussian machine.

154
00:11:27,775 --> 00:11:29,275
Karl was raised to be a soldier.

155
00:11:29,344 --> 00:11:32,074
he is admired by...

156
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,738
by his regiment.

157
00:11:33,848 --> 00:11:36,248
Johanna came to get a husband,
not to enlist.

158
00:11:36,351 --> 00:11:37,651
The world is full of husbands,

159
00:11:37,652 --> 00:11:40,280
but there are
very few crown princes.

160
00:11:40,388 --> 00:11:41,912
I don't know
how you raise this girl,

161
00:11:42,023 --> 00:11:45,083
but even she should see that
Karl is no ordinary fellow.

162
00:11:46,094 --> 00:11:48,085
But there are times
when even a prince

163
00:11:48,196 --> 00:11:50,426
should behave
like an ordinary fellow.

164
00:11:50,532 --> 00:11:53,092
I know how important this
alliance is to you, Ferddie.

165
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:55,192
But you must face facts.

166
00:11:55,303 --> 00:11:57,533
You, too, Mathilde,
must face facts.

167
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,664
Money will not get you
what you want.

168
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,041
What do you mean?

169
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:02,509
An interesting thing
has happened

170
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,205
to the royal families of Europe.

171
00:12:04,312 --> 00:12:07,509
Every queen you encounter has
3 or 4 daughters to marry off.

172
00:12:07,615 --> 00:12:11,210
But there are mighty few
royal princes around.

173
00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:13,583
There are eight sons
in Grabnick.

174
00:12:13,688 --> 00:12:15,519
They never bathe.

175
00:12:15,623 --> 00:12:17,284
There's Prince Olap.

176
00:12:17,392 --> 00:12:20,259
He has ah... buck teeth.

177
00:12:20,361 --> 00:12:23,057
Do you want your grandchildren
to have backed teeth?

178
00:12:23,164 --> 00:12:24,531
Ferddie, that's blackmail!

179
00:12:24,532 --> 00:12:26,557
Well, even the king must live.

180
00:12:28,469 --> 00:12:30,266
Well, let's not quarrel.

181
00:12:30,371 --> 00:12:32,532
We both want this marriage.

182
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,108
I'm not blaming Karl.
It's your fault.

183
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:36,938
You've taken
a perfectly nice boy,

184
00:12:37,045 --> 00:12:39,570
and brought him up
to be a Prussian pickle.

185
00:12:39,681 --> 00:12:42,206
Pickle?
He has the best education.

186
00:12:42,317 --> 00:12:44,751
Not education, training.

187
00:12:44,852 --> 00:12:47,218
You haven't taught him how to
get along with people.

188
00:12:47,322 --> 00:12:49,483
They'd be no problem
with your honor

189
00:12:49,591 --> 00:12:54,494
if you'd only get him to radiate
a little warmth and charm.

190
00:12:56,531 --> 00:12:58,658
Warmth and charm.

191
00:13:15,116 --> 00:13:17,414
Professor Juttner, did
his majesty sent for you, too?

192
00:13:17,518 --> 00:13:18,652
Well, it must be serious.

193
00:13:18,653 --> 00:13:20,245
After all,
it's the middle of the night.

194
00:13:20,355 --> 00:13:22,016
What do you think
it's all about, professor?

195
00:13:22,123 --> 00:13:23,123
Perhaps they're
going to behead me

196
00:13:23,124 --> 00:13:24,887
for teaching you
to read and write.

197
00:13:24,993 --> 00:13:26,927
I was merely obeying orders.

198
00:13:27,028 --> 00:13:30,088
I myself am against higher
education for the nobility.

199
00:13:31,099 --> 00:13:33,431
Well, they can't behead me.
I'm the heir apparent.

200
00:13:33,534 --> 00:13:36,526
If you knew more history,
you'd be more worried.

201
00:13:47,749 --> 00:13:48,615
Warmth and charm,

202
00:13:48,616 --> 00:13:50,846
that's what you need,
warmth and charm.

203
00:13:50,952 --> 00:13:52,783
A friendly smile,
a cordial hand clasp

204
00:13:52,887 --> 00:13:54,684
that's the new order
for the day.

205
00:13:54,789 --> 00:13:56,023
Why is that important?

206
00:13:56,024 --> 00:13:57,257
The princess thinks
it's important,

207
00:13:57,258 --> 00:13:58,758
that's why it's important.

208
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,721
You are a Prussian machine.

209
00:14:00,828 --> 00:14:02,625
I saw you
with the princess tonight.

210
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,460
You dance as if
you were storming a fortress.

211
00:14:06,134 --> 00:14:08,159
1-2-3, 1-2-3.

212
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:10,499
1-2-3, 1-2-3.

213
00:14:10,605 --> 00:14:12,334
You call that dancing?

214
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,169
You're not much better.

215
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:16,072
I wasn't engaged
as a dancing master.

216
00:14:16,177 --> 00:14:18,042
What were you engaged on?

217
00:14:18,146 --> 00:14:19,413
To educate him.

218
00:14:19,414 --> 00:14:21,314
He's not educated, he's trained.

219
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:22,916
What have you been doing
with your time?

220
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,184
Following your orders!

221
00:14:24,185 --> 00:14:25,685
Never mind my orders,

222
00:14:25,687 --> 00:14:27,087
just do as I tell you.

223
00:14:27,088 --> 00:14:29,989
Please, don't blame the boy,
your majesty.

224
00:14:30,091 --> 00:14:31,425
Each year, more and more time

225
00:14:31,426 --> 00:14:34,691
has been stolen from studies
and given to marksmanship,

226
00:14:34,796 --> 00:14:37,356
military maneuvers,
fencing masters.

227
00:14:37,465 --> 00:14:40,161
His highness has had no time
for the graces of living.

228
00:14:40,268 --> 00:14:43,066
From now on, you will study
the graces of living.

229
00:14:43,171 --> 00:14:45,731
I hold you responsible.
Order whatever books you need.

230
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,240
Books won't help, sir.

231
00:14:47,241 --> 00:14:48,175
No.

232
00:14:48,176 --> 00:14:50,371
True education
comes from people.

233
00:14:50,478 --> 00:14:52,742
I said it before
and I say it again.

234
00:14:52,847 --> 00:14:54,872
He should have gone
to Heidelberg,

235
00:14:54,982 --> 00:14:56,847
mix with people of his own age,

236
00:14:56,951 --> 00:14:58,451
learn to get along with them.

237
00:14:58,553 --> 00:15:01,420
There are hundreds of
universities, why Heidelberg?

238
00:15:01,522 --> 00:15:03,786
For me,
there is only university.

239
00:15:04,492 --> 00:15:06,790
I went to Heidelberg,
your majesty.

240
00:15:06,894 --> 00:15:08,394
Very well, we go to Heidelberg.

241
00:15:08,496 --> 00:15:09,963
Make the arrangements.

242
00:15:09,964 --> 00:15:11,464
Heidelberg?

243
00:15:12,266 --> 00:15:14,359
Who does Johanna think she is?

244
00:15:14,469 --> 00:15:16,300
Why should I be made over
just to please her?

245
00:15:16,404 --> 00:15:19,305
Because there are 8 princes
in Grabnick.

246
00:15:19,407 --> 00:15:20,999
They never bathe.

247
00:15:21,642 --> 00:15:23,142
There's Prince Olap.

248
00:15:23,144 --> 00:15:25,044
He has back teeth.

249
00:15:25,146 --> 00:15:27,774
I will not listen
to these silly arguments.

250
00:15:27,882 --> 00:15:29,873
As soon as possible,
you'll leave for Heidelberg!

251
00:15:29,984 --> 00:15:33,044
And beggining this instant, you
will radiate warmth and charm.

252
00:15:33,888 --> 00:15:35,446
That's a command.

253
00:16:22,537 --> 00:16:24,037
Hubert, this way!

254
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,332
No horse play, Lutz.

255
00:16:29,644 --> 00:16:30,944
Clear the way.
Clear the way, savages.

256
00:16:30,945 --> 00:16:32,606
We wish to get to the street.

257
00:16:34,615 --> 00:16:37,846
Hubert, help! Help, Hubert!

258
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:41,650
Hubert, the luggages!

259
00:16:44,992 --> 00:16:47,586
help! Put me down!

260
00:16:47,695 --> 00:16:49,959
Put me down!

261
00:16:56,637 --> 00:16:58,537
All through life, we're learning

262
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,607
Learning things we ought to know

263
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,767
Through and through
we're learning

264
00:17:03,377 --> 00:17:05,902
Well, I don't know
if Lutz will enjoy Heidelberg.

265
00:17:06,013 --> 00:17:08,345
But Heidelberg
is certainly enjoying Lutz.

266
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:10,076
In my opinion,
Herr Doctor, these...

267
00:17:10,184 --> 00:17:12,516
I suppose we have to
call them students.

268
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,713
These students are a little
too old for this behavior.

269
00:17:14,822 --> 00:17:16,722
Oh, the first day of term,

270
00:17:16,824 --> 00:17:19,987
good spirits, the excitement
of seeing old friends again.

271
00:17:20,761 --> 00:17:22,261
Now, you just give it a chance,

272
00:17:22,363 --> 00:17:25,161
and I'm sure you'll find
good fellowship very edgy.

273
00:17:25,266 --> 00:17:27,666
Like measles.
Let's find a carriage.

274
00:17:28,202 --> 00:17:30,932
Class of 1874.

275
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:32,869
Willie Klauber!

276
00:17:34,108 --> 00:17:36,406
Well, well,
what are you doing here?

277
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,010
What are you doing
in Heidelberg?

278
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:39,579
Didn't they ever
let you graduate?

279
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,343
Graduate? I'm a full professor.

280
00:17:41,449 --> 00:17:42,949
No!
Yes!

281
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:45,211
Heaven help
the younger generation.

282
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:47,184
When I knew you,
you couldn't even spell.

283
00:17:47,288 --> 00:17:48,788
Sssh!

284
00:17:49,023 --> 00:17:50,423
And what brings you here?

285
00:17:50,424 --> 00:17:53,916
Herr Professor klauber, I have
the honor to present my pupil...

286
00:17:56,063 --> 00:17:58,623
I don't have a pupil
and I don't have the honor.

287
00:18:01,569 --> 00:18:03,069
Cab!

288
00:18:05,373 --> 00:18:06,873
Just a minute!

289
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,335
That's my cab!
New here?

290
00:18:09,443 --> 00:18:10,577
Yes, and let me tell you...

291
00:18:10,578 --> 00:18:12,078
Let me tell you!
A word of advice.

292
00:18:12,146 --> 00:18:13,841
When it comes to
cabs, beer and woman,

293
00:18:13,948 --> 00:18:15,540
if you want them,
grab them and hang on to it.

294
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,345
When I want advice,
I'll ask for it.

295
00:18:17,451 --> 00:18:18,318
Do you know who I am?

296
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:19,843
We're very broad-minded
in Heidelberg.

297
00:18:19,954 --> 00:18:21,454
We let anybody in.

298
00:18:22,924 --> 00:18:23,723
Come on, hop in.

299
00:18:23,724 --> 00:18:26,192
Don't stand there like a stick
or you'll get left.

300
00:18:26,827 --> 00:18:28,886
Smile just once
and you can have my sit,

301
00:18:28,996 --> 00:18:30,623
and I'll sit on your lap.

302
00:18:30,898 --> 00:18:32,525
Prussian pickle!

303
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:34,133
To the inn we're marching

304
00:18:34,235 --> 00:18:36,135
For our throats are parching

305
00:18:36,237 --> 00:18:39,729
And the fruit trees arching
in the month of may

306
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,364
For there's no good fellow

307
00:18:41,475 --> 00:18:43,443
When he's feeling mellow

308
00:18:43,544 --> 00:18:46,570
From the beer so yellow
would delay

309
00:18:47,415 --> 00:18:49,280
To the inn we're going

310
00:18:49,383 --> 00:18:50,907
Where the beer is flowing

311
00:18:51,018 --> 00:18:54,681
And we'll soon be blowing off
the foam on top

312
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:56,689
And as we're explaining

313
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,452
They'll be no refraining

314
00:18:58,559 --> 00:18:59,993
Till we're all through

315
00:18:59,994 --> 00:19:01,757
draining every drop

316
00:19:02,596 --> 00:19:04,154
All in step we're swinging

317
00:19:04,265 --> 00:19:06,096
While we join in singing

318
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,727
With our voices ringing
in a merry rhyme

319
00:19:09,837 --> 00:19:11,429
There is joy alounding

320
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:13,302
In our song resounding

321
00:19:13,407 --> 00:19:17,241
While our steins are
resounding all the time

322
00:19:17,345 --> 00:19:19,108
Now the spring we're greeting

323
00:19:19,213 --> 00:19:20,874
With our merry meeting

324
00:19:20,982 --> 00:19:24,816
And our day completing
with a mug of beer

325
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:26,477
To the inn we're heading

326
00:19:26,587 --> 00:19:28,418
All our cares we're shedding

327
00:19:28,522 --> 00:19:31,685
As we start another college year

328
00:19:39,934 --> 00:19:41,434
To the inn we're marching

329
00:19:41,435 --> 00:19:43,096
For our throats are parching

330
00:19:43,204 --> 00:19:46,935
And the fruit trees arching
in the month of may

331
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,770
To the inn we're marching

332
00:19:48,876 --> 00:19:50,605
For our throats are parching

333
00:19:50,711 --> 00:19:52,211
To the inn

334
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:54,179
To the inn

335
00:19:54,281 --> 00:19:56,408
We're marching on

336
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,656
Beer, here

337
00:20:03,657 --> 00:20:04,391
Beer, here

338
00:20:04,392 --> 00:20:06,053
Turn the barrel upside down

339
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,227
Beer, here

340
00:20:07,228 --> 00:20:08,128
Beer, here

341
00:20:08,129 --> 00:20:10,097
What a lovely way to get drunk!

342
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:12,425
Savages!

343
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:14,694
Well, you've... you've chosen
a mad house for his highness.

344
00:20:14,802 --> 00:20:16,963
Doctor Juttner said it was
the finest inn in Heidelberg.

345
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:18,902
Juttner would like this place.

346
00:20:19,006 --> 00:20:21,236
Does this carousing
go on everyday?

347
00:20:21,342 --> 00:20:23,640
No, your excellency,
only every night.

348
00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:26,546
Who is this person?

349
00:20:26,547 --> 00:20:28,242
Herr Ruder,
the owner of the inn.

350
00:20:28,349 --> 00:20:30,977
You tell him he is not to speak
until we speak to him.

351
00:20:31,085 --> 00:20:32,519
Heae this!

352
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,020
Hubert!

353
00:20:35,189 --> 00:20:36,816
I will not to occupy a suite

354
00:20:36,924 --> 00:20:39,222
where I can hear
those cattle-hollering savages.

355
00:20:39,326 --> 00:20:40,918
You can hear them everywhere.

356
00:20:41,062 --> 00:20:44,122
Your excellency has
the same view as the prince's,

357
00:20:44,231 --> 00:20:45,789
the river Nekar.

358
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,698
The river, yes,
I was coming to that.

359
00:20:48,803 --> 00:20:52,466
How considerate when you know
I suffer from rheumatism.

360
00:20:52,573 --> 00:20:53,640
Forgive me, Herr Lutz.

361
00:20:53,641 --> 00:20:55,199
The river was here
when I arrived.

362
00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:56,576
Don't interrupt.

363
00:20:56,577 --> 00:20:58,841
I had hoped to come to you
and look at you and say

364
00:20:58,946 --> 00:21:01,107
"Hubert, I am satisfied. "

365
00:21:01,649 --> 00:21:04,345
But I am not satisfied, Hubert.

366
00:21:04,452 --> 00:21:07,012
Oh, this might serve for
an ordinary lackey.

367
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:09,783
But did his majesty send an
ordinary lackey with the prince?

368
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:11,551
No, he sent me.

369
00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:14,958
Hubert, who is his excellency?

370
00:21:15,062 --> 00:21:16,529
His highness is valet.

371
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,030
Valet?

372
00:21:19,934 --> 00:21:23,267
Valet, I thought you were
a Prime Minister at least.

373
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,870
Let me tell you that this inn

374
00:21:24,972 --> 00:21:28,772
has been enter taining royalty
for over 300 years.

375
00:21:28,876 --> 00:21:31,037
Oh, they may have lived here
but they were not entertained.

376
00:21:31,145 --> 00:21:33,909
Yes, yes,
barons, counts and dukes.

377
00:21:34,014 --> 00:21:36,574
Never a prince of Karlsburg.

378
00:21:36,684 --> 00:21:39,312
it... it had to enter Heidelberg.

379
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,116
I warn you, we are not
amused by impertinence.

380
00:21:42,223 --> 00:21:44,691
Hubert! Lutz!

381
00:21:47,628 --> 00:21:50,062
Hubert, where my room is?
Where is his highness?

382
00:21:50,164 --> 00:21:52,029
Isn't he with you?
No, he's with you.

383
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:53,633
He's obviously not with me.

384
00:21:53,701 --> 00:21:54,968
Then you've lost the prince.

385
00:21:54,969 --> 00:21:56,202
Lost the prince here?

386
00:21:56,203 --> 00:21:57,570
I knew you couldn't be trusted.

387
00:21:57,571 --> 00:21:59,505
Now, now, don't get excited.

388
00:21:59,607 --> 00:22:02,098
He'll get here, and with
more dignity than you did.

389
00:22:02,209 --> 00:22:04,507
Now, you can laugh
but he's my responsibility.

390
00:22:04,612 --> 00:22:05,445
Nonsense.

391
00:22:05,446 --> 00:22:06,970
I look after him in Heidelberg.

392
00:22:07,081 --> 00:22:09,345
Only his mind,
I look after his body.

393
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,283
This may come as a shock to you,
my dear Lutzy.

394
00:22:12,386 --> 00:22:15,480
But the mind is
more important than the body.

395
00:22:15,589 --> 00:22:17,089
Well, you've got to
have a body to be a king.

396
00:22:17,158 --> 00:22:18,658
That is not my worry.

397
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:21,523
His mind isn't lost,
only his body.

398
00:22:21,629 --> 00:22:23,221
And if anything happens to it,

399
00:22:24,231 --> 00:22:26,222
it will be you who will hang.

400
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:30,793
Kathie! Kathie! Kathie!

401
00:22:34,141 --> 00:22:37,770
I hear you call my friends

402
00:22:37,878 --> 00:22:41,109
There's beer for all my friends

403
00:22:41,215 --> 00:22:44,184
But patience is a virtue

404
00:22:44,285 --> 00:22:48,221
Kathie recommends

405
00:22:48,322 --> 00:22:51,758
I fear my ears will burst

406
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:55,488
Before I quench your thirst

407
00:22:55,596 --> 00:22:58,292
I really should
teach you manners

408
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:02,267
But let's tap the barrel first

409
00:23:08,976 --> 00:23:11,774
Come, boys,
let's all be gay, boys

410
00:23:11,879 --> 00:23:15,508
For education should be
scientific play, boys

411
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,983
Don't dip your pen in ink, boys

412
00:23:19,086 --> 00:23:22,578
Let every prudent student
study how to drink

413
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:23,590
Bom, bom, bom!

414
00:23:23,591 --> 00:23:26,185
Although exams are near, boys

415
00:23:26,293 --> 00:23:28,124
Though you may flunk
because you're drunk

416
00:23:28,229 --> 00:23:29,992
Don't shed a tear

417
00:23:30,097 --> 00:23:31,164
Bom, bom, bom!

418
00:23:31,165 --> 00:23:33,565
Folks may call you rowdy

419
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:37,228
Your reputations may be cloudy

420
00:23:37,338 --> 00:23:40,466
You'll never graduate
"Cum Laude"

421
00:23:40,574 --> 00:23:44,442
But you'll get a passing mark
in drinking beer

422
00:23:47,248 --> 00:23:50,012
Come, boys,
let's turn to beer, boys

423
00:23:50,117 --> 00:23:54,053
And make it clear we're awfully
glad that Kathie's here, boys

424
00:23:54,154 --> 00:23:57,385
Why waste your time
with books, boys

425
00:23:57,491 --> 00:24:00,722
Let every prudent student
study women's looks

426
00:24:00,828 --> 00:24:01,794
Bom, bom, bom!

427
00:24:01,795 --> 00:24:04,423
Let old professors state, boys

428
00:24:04,531 --> 00:24:05,698
you'll be dismissed

429
00:24:05,699 --> 00:24:08,031
Because
you've kissed a pretty date

430
00:24:08,135 --> 00:24:09,535
Bom, bom, bom!

431
00:24:09,536 --> 00:24:11,800
Gladly we will throttle

432
00:24:11,905 --> 00:24:15,306
Euripides and Aristotle

433
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:19,470
Then lift another stein
or bottle, boys

434
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,606
And all together
we will celebrate

435
00:24:22,716 --> 00:24:27,915
Then lift another stein
or bottle, boys

436
00:24:28,022 --> 00:24:33,858
And all together celebrate

437
00:24:40,267 --> 00:24:42,531
Oh, boys, not now.

438
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:45,001
Who, who?

439
00:24:45,105 --> 00:24:46,834
Who is so charming?

440
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:50,706
Who, who do we adore?

441
00:24:50,811 --> 00:24:54,611
Who's so sweet and disarming?

442
00:24:54,715 --> 00:24:58,344
Kathie, the queen of the corps

443
00:24:58,452 --> 00:25:02,445
Yah, yah, yah!

444
00:25:02,556 --> 00:25:06,287
Kathie, the queen of the corps

445
00:25:06,393 --> 00:25:10,090
Yah, yah, yah!

446
00:25:10,197 --> 00:25:13,655
Kathie's the girl we adore

447
00:25:13,767 --> 00:25:15,758
Yeah!

448
00:25:16,403 --> 00:25:18,303
Boys, I drink to your health.

449
00:25:18,405 --> 00:25:19,963
To Kathie!

450
00:25:20,074 --> 00:25:23,566
Kathie! Kathie! Kathie!

451
00:25:26,213 --> 00:25:29,011
Kathie, Kathie,
come, come, come.

452
00:25:29,116 --> 00:25:30,777
He's here. He's here.
Who's here, uncle?

453
00:25:30,884 --> 00:25:32,977
The prince,
of course, his highness.

454
00:25:33,087 --> 00:25:34,253
Let me look at you.

455
00:25:34,254 --> 00:25:36,518
Turn. Oh, take this off,
take this off.

456
00:25:36,623 --> 00:25:37,990
So here's the bouquet,

457
00:25:37,991 --> 00:25:39,891
and the welcome song
to sing for you.

458
00:25:39,993 --> 00:25:42,052
Go, darling.
Oh, uncle, must I?

459
00:25:42,162 --> 00:25:45,029
Of course,
what's the matter with you?

460
00:25:45,132 --> 00:25:47,259
I've never done it before
and I'm nervous.

461
00:25:47,368 --> 00:25:49,393
Nervous, who isn't nervous?

462
00:25:49,503 --> 00:25:51,095
There isn't an inn
in all Heidelberg

463
00:25:51,205 --> 00:25:53,264
with a real live prince
for a tenant!

464
00:25:53,374 --> 00:25:55,808
And if he doesn't stay,
I shall never live in town.

465
00:25:55,909 --> 00:25:57,409
A matter of pride.

466
00:25:57,411 --> 00:25:59,709
Besides
he is going to take 6 rooms.

467
00:26:07,755 --> 00:26:09,347
Your highness,
permit me to say...

468
00:26:09,456 --> 00:26:12,357
Your highness, it seems the
young lady has something to say.

469
00:26:12,459 --> 00:26:14,120
Go on, my dear.

470
00:26:17,765 --> 00:26:21,724
Welcome highness
to Herr Ruder's inn.

471
00:26:21,835 --> 00:26:25,066
We hope you'll like our place.

472
00:26:25,172 --> 00:26:29,541
There's a room to rest
for a royal guest,

473
00:26:29,643 --> 00:26:33,477
and a bowl
for washing your face.

474
00:26:35,482 --> 00:26:37,643
Thank you.
Bravo! That was charming.

475
00:26:37,751 --> 00:26:39,343
What is your name, young lady?

476
00:26:39,453 --> 00:26:40,286
Kathie.

477
00:26:40,287 --> 00:26:41,811
Your highness,
it is my duty to remind...

478
00:26:41,922 --> 00:26:43,856
Excuse me, your excellency.

479
00:26:45,058 --> 00:26:46,492
My niece, your highness.

480
00:26:46,493 --> 00:26:48,893
This is the landlord,
Joseph Ruder.

481
00:26:48,996 --> 00:26:50,657
Yeah, that's me, that's me.

482
00:26:50,764 --> 00:26:52,288
At your service, your highness.

483
00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:53,599
Your rooms are ready.

484
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,867
If you will like... to...

485
00:26:54,868 --> 00:26:57,063
let... show you... the suite.

486
00:26:57,171 --> 00:26:59,139
Permit me, your highness.
This is no place

487
00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:01,503
for the heir apparent
to the throne of Karlsburg.

488
00:27:01,608 --> 00:27:02,675
Why, Lutz?

489
00:27:02,676 --> 00:27:04,803
The beds are lumpy.
The linen is cotton.

490
00:27:04,912 --> 00:27:07,210
And as you hear, it's a low
drinking place for students

491
00:27:07,314 --> 00:27:08,814
who come here
to behave like roughings.

492
00:27:08,849 --> 00:27:09,882
Nonsense!

493
00:27:09,883 --> 00:27:11,317
I know this inn.

494
00:27:11,318 --> 00:27:12,979
Well, no palace is here.

495
00:27:13,086 --> 00:27:14,917
This is a place for students,

496
00:27:15,022 --> 00:27:17,286
not for lackey's
and chamberlains.

497
00:27:17,391 --> 00:27:19,484
In my opinion, this is perfect.

498
00:27:19,593 --> 00:27:21,027
In my opinion, it is impossible.

499
00:27:21,028 --> 00:27:22,620
In my opinion,

500
00:27:22,729 --> 00:27:25,289
his highness
should form his own opinion.

501
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:27,333
Permit me, your highness.

502
00:27:38,345 --> 00:27:41,109
And the shelf up here
has plenty of room for hats.

503
00:27:41,215 --> 00:27:43,683
It's even high enough
to put a crown on.

504
00:27:43,784 --> 00:27:45,615
I rarely take a crown
when I travel.

505
00:27:45,719 --> 00:27:48,244
My grandfather prefers
I leave it in the vault.

506
00:27:49,089 --> 00:27:52,422
And this is the most
comfortable bed in inn.

507
00:27:53,427 --> 00:27:55,486
For the present,
I'll take your word for that.

508
00:27:55,596 --> 00:27:56,896
I put two feather beds on.

509
00:27:56,897 --> 00:27:59,422
They'll keep you warm
on the coldest night.

510
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,125
And the springs are good, too.

511
00:28:02,236 --> 00:28:04,796
See?
I endorse the springs.

512
00:28:07,541 --> 00:28:09,634
Now, in the sitting room.

513
00:28:11,612 --> 00:28:13,112
If your highness
will be good enough

514
00:28:13,113 --> 00:28:14,380
to go into the sitting room.

515
00:28:14,381 --> 00:28:15,881
Thank you.

516
00:28:18,752 --> 00:28:20,845
Every evening, I'll bring up
an eiderdown quilt

517
00:28:20,954 --> 00:28:21,921
and put it on your bed

518
00:28:21,922 --> 00:28:24,618
so that it's nice and warm
for you when you go to sleep.

519
00:28:24,725 --> 00:28:26,317
You frighten me.
It's the first day of may,

520
00:28:26,426 --> 00:28:28,587
and you speak as though
I shall expect a blizzard.

521
00:28:28,695 --> 00:28:30,096
Oh, no, your highness.

522
00:28:30,097 --> 00:28:31,621
Why, from now on till autumn,

523
00:28:31,732 --> 00:28:33,723
the weather is
as mild and fresh,

524
00:28:33,834 --> 00:28:35,563
lovely as can be.

525
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:39,538
There!

526
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,373
Oh, did you ever smell such air?

527
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,135
Go ahead, take a deep breath.

528
00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:53,611
The quality seems excellent.

529
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,244
Right from your highness' window

530
00:28:55,355 --> 00:28:58,085
is the most beautiful view
in all of Heidelberg.

531
00:28:58,191 --> 00:28:59,691
You can see the river Nekar

532
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,456
and way up on the mountain,
the castle.

533
00:29:04,064 --> 00:29:06,032
I gather that you, Kathie.

534
00:29:06,133 --> 00:29:07,964
That is your name, isn't it?

535
00:29:08,068 --> 00:29:09,592
That you are most anxious
to make sure

536
00:29:09,703 --> 00:29:11,864
that I am comfortable
in every way.

537
00:29:11,972 --> 00:29:13,205
Good.

538
00:29:13,206 --> 00:29:15,436
But what happens
if some other person

539
00:29:15,542 --> 00:29:18,409
less understanding
should appear on the scene.

540
00:29:18,512 --> 00:29:21,174
My uncle has put me
in complete charge.

541
00:29:21,281 --> 00:29:23,806
Your highness' slightest wish
will be my command.

542
00:29:23,917 --> 00:29:26,715
It's a comfort to know that the
necessities will taken cared of.

543
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:31,018
However, I hope that Heidelberg
will afford some pleasure, too.

544
00:29:31,892 --> 00:29:33,757
Do you think it will?

545
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,328
The students are a lot of fun.

546
00:29:35,329 --> 00:29:37,297
And there are beer parties,

547
00:29:37,397 --> 00:29:39,763
and here is the piano.

548
00:29:41,802 --> 00:29:43,169
Why so it is.

549
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:45,468
I hope
your highness likes music.

550
00:29:45,572 --> 00:29:47,802
It's a wonderful way
to past time.

551
00:29:47,908 --> 00:29:51,503
I look forward to many
musical evening in your company.

552
00:29:51,612 --> 00:29:53,671
That little song
you greeted me with.

553
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,908
I recognized the melody,
but did you write the words?

554
00:29:57,017 --> 00:29:58,678
I know the words were silly, but

555
00:29:58,785 --> 00:30:01,515
Uncle Ruder made them up
especially for you.

556
00:30:01,622 --> 00:30:04,284
And I wouldn't hurt
his feelings for anything.

557
00:30:04,391 --> 00:30:05,758
The real words are lovely.

558
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:08,694
I know.
Why don't you sing them for me?

559
00:30:09,262 --> 00:30:11,093
Go ahead. I insist.

560
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:14,391
Very well.

561
00:30:25,178 --> 00:30:31,083
When it's summertime
in Heidelberg

562
00:30:31,952 --> 00:30:37,015
There's beauty everywhere

563
00:30:38,492 --> 00:30:45,625
All the tress are dressed
in their sunday best

564
00:30:46,466 --> 00:30:52,701
And brass band
plays in the square

565
00:30:56,476 --> 00:31:02,278
Everyday is like a holiday

566
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:08,317
Strolling underneath the sun

567
00:31:10,323 --> 00:31:14,350
All the frauleins wear

568
00:31:14,461 --> 00:31:17,862
flowers in their hair

569
00:31:18,632 --> 00:31:24,537
With a smile
to spare for everyone

570
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:29,675
The fragrant breeze

571
00:31:30,243 --> 00:31:33,178
The linden trees

572
00:31:34,247 --> 00:31:40,811
The promenade where lovers stray

573
00:31:42,289 --> 00:31:46,726
But have a care

574
00:31:46,827 --> 00:31:49,887
Or someone there

575
00:31:50,897 --> 00:31:58,463
May steal your heart away

576
00:32:02,242 --> 00:32:08,511
Strange things
happen on a summer night

577
00:32:09,549 --> 00:32:13,986
When the bells begin to chime

578
00:32:16,056 --> 00:32:19,753
It could happen to

579
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:24,490
Someone just like you

580
00:32:25,832 --> 00:32:34,638
Down in Heidelberg in summertime

581
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:46,280
Uncle Ruder's words in my voice.

582
00:32:46,386 --> 00:32:48,718
No wonder you smiled
when I sang to you.

583
00:32:48,822 --> 00:32:50,089
Just a moment.

584
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:51,955
You haven't been dismissed yet.

585
00:32:52,058 --> 00:32:55,619
In Karlsburg, it is not the
custom to walk out on royalty.

586
00:32:56,329 --> 00:32:57,921
I beg your highness' pardon.

587
00:32:58,665 --> 00:33:00,132
If your highness will excuse me.

588
00:33:00,133 --> 00:33:02,465
Before you go,
there's just one more thing.

589
00:33:02,569 --> 00:33:04,093
Your highness wishes something.

590
00:33:04,204 --> 00:33:06,297
Yes, just this.

591
00:33:10,377 --> 00:33:13,107
I don't know about the custom
in Karlsburg, your highness.

592
00:33:13,213 --> 00:33:15,738
But at Ruder's inn, that does
not come with the service.

593
00:33:30,363 --> 00:33:31,990
History, Lutz.

594
00:33:32,098 --> 00:33:33,827
The ancient or modern,
your highness.

595
00:33:33,934 --> 00:33:35,663
Ancient.

596
00:33:41,741 --> 00:33:43,436
Is this the lecture hall
for ancient history?

597
00:33:43,543 --> 00:33:45,204
Yes. New student, eh?

598
00:33:45,312 --> 00:33:46,145
Yes.

599
00:33:46,146 --> 00:33:47,875
Registered for this class?

600
00:33:47,981 --> 00:33:49,048
What is your name?

601
00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:50,846
I am Karl France of Karlsburg.

602
00:33:50,951 --> 00:33:51,917
France.

603
00:33:51,918 --> 00:33:54,682
Whereas, here you are.
Right inside, Herr France.

604
00:33:54,788 --> 00:33:56,288
Herr France?

605
00:33:56,389 --> 00:33:58,550
Move on, Herr France,
you'll be late.

606
00:34:11,438 --> 00:34:13,429
Sit down! Don't block the aisle.

607
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:21,739
His excellency,
Professor klauber.

608
00:34:25,552 --> 00:34:27,052
What's the matter with you,
Herr France?

609
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,781
Stump your feet like the others.

610
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:30,857
Professor klauber is coming in.

611
00:34:33,093 --> 00:34:34,493
Both feet.

612
00:34:34,494 --> 00:34:36,428
You're no different
from the rest.

613
00:34:50,744 --> 00:34:53,770
Welcome to ancient history,
gentlemen.

614
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,745
It's a new term and ah...

615
00:34:55,849 --> 00:34:58,545
we'll start with the new face.

616
00:34:58,885 --> 00:35:01,479
It means it will be your face.

617
00:35:01,588 --> 00:35:05,388
All history is a record
of significant milestones

618
00:35:05,492 --> 00:35:07,790
in the development of man.

619
00:35:07,894 --> 00:35:10,920
Can you name just one
such contribution

620
00:35:11,031 --> 00:35:15,058
in the 500 years before
the Christian era?

621
00:35:17,003 --> 00:35:19,471
Just one,
that shouldn't be too difficult.

622
00:35:19,572 --> 00:35:20,606
I am aware of many,

623
00:35:20,607 --> 00:35:23,132
I was merely trying to
select the most important.

624
00:35:23,243 --> 00:35:26,144
The conquest
of Alexander The Great.

625
00:35:28,381 --> 00:35:31,908
Accurate, but not as important
as another conquest.

626
00:35:32,018 --> 00:35:34,748
While Alexander was
beating people over the head,

627
00:35:34,854 --> 00:35:38,585
Aristotle was
awakening the minds of men.

628
00:35:38,692 --> 00:35:40,192
Can the Herr Professor
name a figure

629
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,820
of greater strength
than Alexander.

630
00:35:42,929 --> 00:35:44,521
The gorilla.

631
00:35:46,232 --> 00:35:47,961
We will discuss Aristotle.

632
00:35:48,068 --> 00:35:49,865
Ah, Herr Bauer.

633
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:52,331
Social graces, indeed.

634
00:35:52,439 --> 00:35:53,939
Warmth and charm.

635
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,074
But it certainly didn't charm me

636
00:35:55,075 --> 00:35:57,600
when that officious
nobody called me Herr France.

637
00:35:57,711 --> 00:35:59,211
They have no manners.

638
00:35:59,312 --> 00:36:01,780
That's quite polite
in talking to a freshman.

639
00:36:01,881 --> 00:36:03,381
But if it bothered you,

640
00:36:03,383 --> 00:36:05,351
why didn't you tell him
who you were?

641
00:36:05,452 --> 00:36:07,249
At first,
I didn't have a chance,

642
00:36:07,354 --> 00:36:09,288
but then I realized
he wasn't the sort of fellow

643
00:36:09,389 --> 00:36:10,823
who'd be impressed by it.

644
00:36:10,824 --> 00:36:12,951
Ah, you've learned a lot
in one day.

645
00:36:13,059 --> 00:36:14,651
They're the ones
that'll have to learn.

646
00:36:14,761 --> 00:36:16,261
If they had any knowledge
of tradition,

647
00:36:16,363 --> 00:36:17,955
they'd know better
than to order me to

648
00:36:18,064 --> 00:36:20,897
stump my feet just because
a professor comes into the room.

649
00:36:21,368 --> 00:36:23,268
It's a matter of respect.

650
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:24,870
Who was the professor?

651
00:36:24,971 --> 00:36:26,836
Klauber.

652
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,840
Noble prize winner.

653
00:36:28,942 --> 00:36:31,877
It's in the finest tradition
to honor such a man.

654
00:36:31,978 --> 00:36:33,312
He's a full professor.

655
00:36:33,313 --> 00:36:35,178
And I am a prince.

656
00:36:35,281 --> 00:36:38,045
Position of
no academic distinction.

657
00:36:40,587 --> 00:36:44,023
My dear, Herr Doctor, you find
this very amusing, don't you?

658
00:36:44,124 --> 00:36:46,149
My dear, boy.

659
00:36:46,259 --> 00:36:47,920
If you'll only relax,

660
00:36:48,028 --> 00:36:50,121
you'll find it amusing, too.

661
00:36:50,864 --> 00:36:52,388
Listen to them.

662
00:36:52,499 --> 00:36:54,262
They are
having a wonderful time.

663
00:36:54,367 --> 00:36:56,267
If you could only be
one of them, a student.

664
00:36:56,369 --> 00:36:59,270
Why should I pretend to be
nobody when I am somebody?

665
00:37:03,209 --> 00:37:05,074
All your philosophy
doesn't alter the fact

666
00:37:05,178 --> 00:37:07,339
that quality is born in a man.

667
00:37:07,447 --> 00:37:10,245
That's very shrewd,
your highness.

668
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:11,483
And very true.

669
00:37:11,484 --> 00:37:13,782
But in Heidelberg, they either
don't know it or they don't care

670
00:37:13,887 --> 00:37:15,684
Oh, no, my boy, no.

671
00:37:15,789 --> 00:37:17,484
You see, in Karlsburg,

672
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,785
the quality is in the title.

673
00:37:19,893 --> 00:37:21,827
In Heidelberg,

674
00:37:21,928 --> 00:37:24,328
the quality is in the man.

675
00:37:24,431 --> 00:37:25,955
Come in.

676
00:37:27,834 --> 00:37:30,496
Excuse me, your highness,
dinner is ready.

677
00:37:30,603 --> 00:37:33,094
Would you prefer it
in the privacy of your room?

678
00:37:33,206 --> 00:37:34,706
or on the terrace?

679
00:37:34,707 --> 00:37:36,402
Where do
the ordinary students eat?

680
00:37:36,509 --> 00:37:38,101
In this weather, on the terrace.

681
00:37:38,211 --> 00:37:40,941
Very well,
on the terrace please.

682
00:37:43,416 --> 00:37:44,916
Thank you.

683
00:37:44,984 --> 00:37:47,851
You take a great deal
for granted, Herr Doctor.

684
00:37:47,954 --> 00:37:50,218
Oh, no, I'm a slave to orders.

685
00:37:50,323 --> 00:37:52,348
His majesty
put me in charge here.

686
00:37:53,726 --> 00:37:56,286
Well, I'll go to my room
and freshen up.

687
00:37:56,396 --> 00:37:57,763
Meet you here in a few moments.

688
00:37:57,764 --> 00:37:59,031
Don't hurry yourself.

689
00:37:59,032 --> 00:38:01,227
I hope I have your permission
to go to the terrace.

690
00:38:01,334 --> 00:38:02,961
Herr Professor.

691
00:38:09,676 --> 00:38:11,176
Good evening, your highness.

692
00:38:12,011 --> 00:38:13,511
Would you like
your dinner right now?

693
00:38:13,513 --> 00:38:14,713
Yes.

694
00:38:14,714 --> 00:38:16,341
What would your highness like?

695
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:19,018
What do
the ordinary students eat?

696
00:38:27,227 --> 00:38:28,727
Kathie!

697
00:38:29,195 --> 00:38:30,992
You haven't been dismissed yet.

698
00:38:32,031 --> 00:38:33,298
I'm sorry, your highness.

699
00:38:33,299 --> 00:38:34,823
I seem to have forgotten again.

700
00:38:34,934 --> 00:38:36,492
I'm not so sure you forgot.

701
00:38:36,603 --> 00:38:37,936
What's this?

702
00:38:37,937 --> 00:38:39,598
Kraut and Frankfurt.

703
00:39:04,564 --> 00:39:06,429
It's good, isn't it?

704
00:39:06,533 --> 00:39:07,699
Are you still here?

705
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,327
You haven't dismissed me.

706
00:39:09,435 --> 00:39:10,669
It's good, isn't it?

707
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,934
It's ah... not bad.

708
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:13,872
It's very good.

709
00:39:13,873 --> 00:39:16,899
I can see you like it, and it
won't hurt you to admit it.

710
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:19,342
All right then, I like it.

711
00:39:19,445 --> 00:39:21,174
It's even better with beer.

712
00:39:21,948 --> 00:39:23,609
I don't think it could be.

713
00:39:35,094 --> 00:39:36,594
It is.

714
00:39:37,931 --> 00:39:40,331
It's difficult for all
new students the first day, and

715
00:39:40,433 --> 00:39:43,129
must be even harder
for your highness.

716
00:39:43,236 --> 00:39:44,999
Do you know once you
get used to Heidelberg,

717
00:39:45,104 --> 00:39:46,604
you'll find
you like a lot of things

718
00:39:46,706 --> 00:39:48,173
you never dreamed you'd like.

719
00:39:48,174 --> 00:39:50,369
I didn't come to Heidelberg
for amusement.

720
00:39:50,476 --> 00:39:52,603
What difference does it make
if you have fun anyway?

721
00:39:52,712 --> 00:39:54,339
It doesn't cost any more.

722
00:39:54,447 --> 00:39:56,642
You know,
you ought to join a corps.

723
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:00,178
You know, it's more fun
than kraut and Frankfurt.

724
00:40:00,286 --> 00:40:01,520
If you say so.

725
00:40:01,521 --> 00:40:02,988
Now,
what corps do you like best?

726
00:40:02,989 --> 00:40:04,356
The West Falien.

727
00:40:04,357 --> 00:40:06,587
They're all fine friendly boys.

728
00:40:06,693 --> 00:40:08,820
Seem to have more fun
than any other corps.

729
00:40:08,928 --> 00:40:10,725
Then I'll join the West Falien.

730
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,559
Oh, no, your highness.

731
00:40:12,665 --> 00:40:16,362
They haven't a title among them.
You belong with the Sax Blusean.

732
00:40:16,469 --> 00:40:18,232
They don't accept commoners.

733
00:40:18,338 --> 00:40:21,171
They're
all barons, counts, dukes.

734
00:40:21,274 --> 00:40:22,641
No princes, but...

735
00:40:22,642 --> 00:40:25,236
There aren't enough princes
around to make a corps.

736
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,680
That presents a problem.

737
00:40:28,748 --> 00:40:30,443
I'll need your advice.

738
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:32,017
Sit down, Kathie.

739
00:40:32,018 --> 00:40:33,518
I shouldn't, your highness.

740
00:40:33,553 --> 00:40:35,578
May I be dismissed?
You may not.

741
00:40:35,688 --> 00:40:38,418
You have made a great
disadvantage, your highness.

742
00:40:38,524 --> 00:40:40,321
That's the way I want you to be.

743
00:40:40,426 --> 00:40:41,926
Sit down.

744
00:40:45,465 --> 00:40:48,764
Now, you said
you like the West Falien.

745
00:40:49,736 --> 00:40:52,569
Is it because they haven't
any titles amongst them?

746
00:40:52,672 --> 00:40:54,106
Oh, surely your highness.

747
00:40:54,107 --> 00:40:56,575
I have the greatest respect
for the nobility.

748
00:40:56,676 --> 00:40:59,042
You were all nice young men,
but...

749
00:40:59,145 --> 00:41:00,645
But what?

750
00:41:00,647 --> 00:41:03,480
Well, go on. I insist.

751
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:05,551
It would be most presumptuous
of me to...

752
00:41:05,652 --> 00:41:08,086
I give you permission
to be presumptuous.

753
00:41:08,187 --> 00:41:10,348
Well, go on.

754
00:41:10,456 --> 00:41:12,583
Well, for one thing.

755
00:41:12,692 --> 00:41:14,853
The nobility doesn't
seem to be taught manners.

756
00:41:14,961 --> 00:41:17,691
Etiquette, yes, but manners, no.

757
00:41:17,797 --> 00:41:19,731
They don't ask, they take.

758
00:41:19,832 --> 00:41:21,459
I see.

759
00:41:21,567 --> 00:41:23,558
Then if I weren't a prince,

760
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,695
you'll like me better.

761
00:41:25,805 --> 00:41:27,363
I don't know but...

762
00:41:27,473 --> 00:41:30,636
At least I'd get a chance to see
what you're really like.

763
00:41:30,743 --> 00:41:33,769
Try it.
Forget that I am a prince.

764
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,974
It is not for me
to forget that, your highness.

765
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:39,313
All right then,
I'm just one of the students,

766
00:41:39,419 --> 00:41:41,353
just plain Karl France.

767
00:41:41,454 --> 00:41:43,115
We're equals.

768
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:48,354
Just a minute.
I didn't say you can go.

769
00:41:48,461 --> 00:41:50,122
Well, if we're equals,

770
00:41:50,229 --> 00:41:52,094
I can go when I choose.

771
00:41:52,799 --> 00:41:55,324
You're not giving me
a fair chance, Kathie.

772
00:41:55,435 --> 00:41:57,403
I want us to be friends.

773
00:41:58,104 --> 00:42:00,334
Treat me as you do the others,
will you?

774
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,340
Try.

775
00:42:02,442 --> 00:42:04,000
It's impossible.

776
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:07,079
After all, you are a prince
and I work here.

777
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,213
What will people say?

778
00:42:08,214 --> 00:42:11,081
Oh, don't worry so much
about my reputation.

779
00:42:11,184 --> 00:42:12,651
Oh, no, your highness!

780
00:42:12,652 --> 00:42:14,677
It's my reputation
I'm worried about.

781
00:42:15,822 --> 00:42:17,055
Well, Kathie!

782
00:42:17,056 --> 00:42:19,547
Is the food here as good
as I remember it?

783
00:42:19,659 --> 00:42:21,126
Better, Doctor Juttner.

784
00:42:21,127 --> 00:42:22,924
I'll set another plate.
Thank you.

785
00:42:24,163 --> 00:42:25,663
I owe your highness an apology.

786
00:42:25,732 --> 00:42:27,495
After all,
it's only the first day.

787
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,363
I feel I was much too severe.

788
00:42:29,469 --> 00:42:31,096
You were quite right,
Doctor Juttner.

789
00:42:31,204 --> 00:42:33,502
I've just had confirmation of
your point of view.

790
00:42:33,606 --> 00:42:36,200
Oh, amazing!

791
00:42:36,309 --> 00:42:37,809
In 10 minutes, Kathie,

792
00:42:37,877 --> 00:42:41,244
you accomplish more than I've
been trying to do for 10 years.

793
00:42:41,347 --> 00:42:44,874
It wasn't all kraut and
Frankfurt, was it, my dear?

794
00:42:45,752 --> 00:42:47,252
Hello, Kathie.

795
00:42:47,587 --> 00:42:50,112
Ah, I don't remember
seeing you here before.

796
00:42:50,223 --> 00:42:51,423
New here?

797
00:42:51,424 --> 00:42:54,291
My name's Lucas, student officer
of the West Falien corps.

798
00:42:54,394 --> 00:42:56,760
Now, my dear Kathie,
present the gentleman to me.

799
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:58,897
I have the honor to introduce...

800
00:42:58,898 --> 00:43:00,695
My name is Herr France.

801
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,324
My friend, Doctor Juttner.
Doctor Juttner.

802
00:43:02,435 --> 00:43:04,460
How do you do?
My dear, Herr France,

803
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:06,435
let me welcome you
to Heidelberg.

804
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,507
Thank you, Herr Lucas.

805
00:43:08,508 --> 00:43:10,476
Our friend, Kathie, has just
been telling me about your corps

806
00:43:10,576 --> 00:43:13,477
Won't you sit down please?
And you can tell more about it.

807
00:43:13,579 --> 00:43:15,308
Thank you.

808
00:43:16,182 --> 00:43:18,047
Well, we're not suppose to
boast about our corps.

809
00:43:18,151 --> 00:43:20,517
So what I shall say
is a gross understatement.

810
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:23,384
It just happens to be
the finest corps in Heidelberg.

811
00:43:23,489 --> 00:43:26,014
Why, even in the words
of our glorious Prospero.

812
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:29,288
The West Falien can drink any
other corpsman under the table.

813
00:43:29,395 --> 00:43:31,886
Their skill with sword and saber
is second to none.

814
00:43:31,998 --> 00:43:34,023
That too,
Prospero will tell you.

815
00:43:34,133 --> 00:43:35,896
I'm sure
the Prospero will tell you,

816
00:43:36,002 --> 00:43:38,129
he's an old West Falien himself.

817
00:43:38,237 --> 00:43:39,571
Oh, then who would know better?

818
00:43:39,572 --> 00:43:41,437
Blocking a fox, Lucas?

819
00:43:42,175 --> 00:43:44,575
This is
becoming a bad habit of his.

820
00:43:44,677 --> 00:43:45,677
He lures them away

821
00:43:45,678 --> 00:43:48,238
before a gentleman has a chance
to look them over.

822
00:43:48,347 --> 00:43:50,781
No one that
would interest you, count.

823
00:43:50,883 --> 00:43:53,249
Count Von Asterburg
of the sax blusean.

824
00:43:53,352 --> 00:43:54,852
Doctor Juttner.

825
00:43:54,954 --> 00:43:56,546
Herr France.

826
00:43:56,656 --> 00:43:59,523
I've heard your corps highly
praised, Count Von Asterburg.

827
00:43:59,625 --> 00:44:01,252
There are many who envy us.

828
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,918
You are very fortunate,
Herr France.

829
00:44:03,029 --> 00:44:04,529
Aside from the Sax Blusean,

830
00:44:04,564 --> 00:44:06,828
there isn't a better corps
than the West Falien.

831
00:44:06,933 --> 00:44:08,333
Oh, don't go yet, count.

832
00:44:08,334 --> 00:44:09,568
Why don't you join us?

833
00:44:09,569 --> 00:44:10,469
I'll order some beer

834
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:12,563
and you can sit down
and tell us about your corps.

835
00:44:12,672 --> 00:44:13,738
Perhaps some other time.

836
00:44:13,739 --> 00:44:15,366
Oh, now is
as good a time as any.

837
00:44:15,475 --> 00:44:16,975
We have no vacancies,
Herr France.

838
00:44:17,043 --> 00:44:18,210
I'm prepared to wait.

839
00:44:18,211 --> 00:44:20,270
There are certain requirements,
Herr France.

840
00:44:20,379 --> 00:44:22,279
A man must stick to his class,

841
00:44:22,381 --> 00:44:23,881
a person like you
would find himself

842
00:44:23,883 --> 00:44:25,874
very uncomfortable
in our circle.

843
00:44:25,985 --> 00:44:27,646
Good night.

844
00:44:29,322 --> 00:44:32,052
He's a decent chap really,
but you pressed him hard.

845
00:44:32,158 --> 00:44:33,525
I forgive him.

846
00:44:33,526 --> 00:44:35,026
Will he forgive you?

847
00:44:35,127 --> 00:44:36,856
We'll have no choice.

848
00:44:37,697 --> 00:44:39,631
Come! Meet the West Falien.

849
00:44:40,733 --> 00:44:42,233
Go on.

850
00:44:49,809 --> 00:44:51,009
Silentium!

851
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:52,875
Gentlemen, we have a new recruit

852
00:44:52,979 --> 00:44:54,640
and a good one at that.

853
00:44:54,747 --> 00:44:56,247
There's only one thing
against him.

854
00:44:56,349 --> 00:44:57,649
He eats well, drinks well

855
00:44:57,650 --> 00:44:59,845
and looks as though
he can afford to pay for it.

856
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,020
I give you Karl France.

857
00:45:02,054 --> 00:45:03,522
Welcome!

858
00:45:03,523 --> 00:45:05,548
Richter, cap.

859
00:45:07,193 --> 00:45:09,753
Beer! Beer! Beer!

860
00:45:11,397 --> 00:45:12,921
Disgraceful!

861
00:45:13,032 --> 00:45:14,590
I shall report you
for this, Doctor Juttner,

862
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,224
mingling with commoners.

863
00:45:16,335 --> 00:45:17,636
Why you report me?

864
00:45:17,637 --> 00:45:18,937
I'm living like a king.

865
00:45:18,938 --> 00:45:20,071
But you permit his highness to

866
00:45:20,072 --> 00:45:22,165
contaminate himself
with the rabble.

867
00:45:22,275 --> 00:45:25,472
When his highness
retires tonight, Lutzy.

868
00:45:25,578 --> 00:45:28,741
You can burn his clothes
and fumigate him.

869
00:45:32,952 --> 00:45:35,011
Gentlemen, salamander!

870
00:45:35,821 --> 00:45:38,449
Salamander, up!

871
00:45:40,026 --> 00:45:42,620
Salamander, up!

872
00:45:44,997 --> 00:45:47,261
Salamander, drink!

873
00:45:53,272 --> 00:45:54,967
Drink it down in one breath.

874
00:45:56,075 --> 00:46:01,513
Drink! Drink! Drink!

875
00:46:01,647 --> 00:46:05,139
eins, swei, drei, vier

876
00:46:05,251 --> 00:46:07,811
lift your stein
and drink your beer

877
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,889
Eins, swei, drei, vier

878
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:14,118
Lift your stein
and drink your beer

879
00:46:14,226 --> 00:46:16,285
Drink! Drink! Drink!

880
00:46:16,395 --> 00:46:18,522
To eyes that are bright as stars

881
00:46:18,631 --> 00:46:20,155
When they're shining on me

882
00:46:20,266 --> 00:46:22,427
Drink! Drink! Drink!

883
00:46:22,535 --> 00:46:24,833
To lips that are red and sweet

884
00:46:24,937 --> 00:46:26,768
As the fruit on the tree

885
00:46:26,872 --> 00:46:28,372
Here's a hope

886
00:46:28,407 --> 00:46:31,308
That
those bright eyes will shine

887
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:37,246
Lovingly
longingly soon into mine

888
00:46:38,818 --> 00:46:42,515
May those lips
that are red and sweet

889
00:46:42,622 --> 00:46:46,558
Tonight with joy
my own lips meet

890
00:46:47,226 --> 00:46:48,627
Drink! Drink!

891
00:46:48,628 --> 00:46:50,323
Let the toast start

892
00:46:50,429 --> 00:46:53,592
May young hearts never part

893
00:46:53,699 --> 00:46:55,633
Drink! Drink! Drink!

894
00:46:55,735 --> 00:46:59,796
Let every true lover
salute his sweetheart

895
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,637
Drink! Drink! Drink!

896
00:47:02,742 --> 00:47:04,539
To arms that are white

897
00:47:04,644 --> 00:47:06,908
And warm as a rose in the sun

898
00:47:07,013 --> 00:47:08,981
Drink! Drink! Drink!

899
00:47:09,081 --> 00:47:10,878
To hearts that will love one

900
00:47:10,983 --> 00:47:13,451
Only when I am the one

901
00:47:13,552 --> 00:47:15,247
Here's a hope

902
00:47:15,354 --> 00:47:18,915
That those soft arms will twine

903
00:47:19,025 --> 00:47:23,519
Tenderly,
trustingly soon around mine

904
00:47:26,532 --> 00:47:29,399
AII I ask is the right to see

905
00:47:29,502 --> 00:47:33,438
Those smiling eyes beguiling me

906
00:47:33,539 --> 00:47:35,268
Drink! Drink!

907
00:47:35,374 --> 00:47:37,137
Let the toast start

908
00:47:37,243 --> 00:47:40,406
May young hearts never part

909
00:47:40,513 --> 00:47:42,811
Drink! Drink! Drink!

910
00:47:42,915 --> 00:47:46,078
Let every true lover
salute his sweetheart

911
00:47:46,185 --> 00:47:47,777
Let's drink!

912
00:47:52,191 --> 00:47:55,354
(Students singing in German)

913
00:48:43,008 --> 00:48:44,442
You take the glasses here.

914
00:48:44,443 --> 00:48:46,308
Let's go, go, go.

915
00:48:47,313 --> 00:48:49,508
Here, let's go.

916
00:49:02,161 --> 00:49:03,194
Please, your highness.

917
00:49:03,195 --> 00:49:05,720
No, no, not your highness,
just Karl.

918
00:49:05,831 --> 00:49:07,958
Please, Karl.
I took your advice.

919
00:49:08,067 --> 00:49:10,058
Surely I deserve a reward.

920
00:49:15,674 --> 00:49:17,198
Your highness.

921
00:49:18,978 --> 00:49:20,843
Oh, go away, Lutz!

922
00:49:23,916 --> 00:49:25,150
I'm sorry, your highness.

923
00:49:25,151 --> 00:49:27,119
I shouldn't have done that.

924
00:49:27,219 --> 00:49:28,219
It's not your fault.

925
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:30,313
You've just had too much beer.

926
00:49:30,422 --> 00:49:32,754
No, no, no,
don't blame it on the beer.

927
00:49:32,858 --> 00:49:35,258
I prefer to think it's the beer.

928
00:49:35,361 --> 00:49:37,522
Well,
I prefer you didn't think that.

929
00:49:42,134 --> 00:49:43,795
Good night, Kathie.

930
00:49:51,744 --> 00:49:53,044
Are we alone?

931
00:49:53,045 --> 00:49:55,036
Alone, no, we are together.

932
00:49:55,147 --> 00:49:56,481
What's the matter?

933
00:49:56,482 --> 00:49:58,040
His highness, Karl France,

934
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:00,141
heir apparent
to the throne of Karlsburg,

935
00:50:00,252 --> 00:50:03,050
knight commander of the grand
order of Frederick The Bold,

936
00:50:03,155 --> 00:50:04,289
and so on.

937
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:06,121
has just been assaulted.

938
00:50:06,225 --> 00:50:08,716
Where?
On the premises.

939
00:50:08,828 --> 00:50:11,194
Your niece knocked him down.

940
00:50:11,297 --> 00:50:12,958
Maybe he got fresh.

941
00:50:13,065 --> 00:50:14,565
Princes do not get fresh.

942
00:50:14,667 --> 00:50:16,532
They occasionally make advances.

943
00:50:17,336 --> 00:50:19,736
You realize
what will come of this, Ruder?

944
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:21,966
He won't get fresh again.

945
00:50:22,074 --> 00:50:23,735
You take this very lightly,

946
00:50:23,843 --> 00:50:25,310
but I do not.

947
00:50:25,311 --> 00:50:26,869
It is my pleasure to inform you

948
00:50:26,979 --> 00:50:29,948
that the consequences
will be disastrous.

949
00:50:30,049 --> 00:50:31,049
Thank you.

950
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:33,814
It would... disastrous?

951
00:50:33,919 --> 00:50:35,386
What are you talking about?

952
00:50:35,387 --> 00:50:37,753
In Karlsburg,
for what your niece dared to do,

953
00:50:37,857 --> 00:50:40,348
she would probably be beheaded.

954
00:50:40,459 --> 00:50:44,225
Please Herr Lutz, don't make
a big point out of nothing.

955
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:46,127
You and I,
we are men of the world.

956
00:50:46,232 --> 00:50:47,465
I am not!

957
00:50:47,466 --> 00:50:48,633
Neither am I.

958
00:50:48,634 --> 00:50:50,602
I'm just trying to
make a living.

959
00:50:51,303 --> 00:50:54,568
But I don't cause you trouble,
why must you cause me a trouble?

960
00:50:54,673 --> 00:50:56,265
It is not a personal matter.

961
00:50:56,375 --> 00:50:58,843
I have sworn to
uphold the honor and dignity

962
00:50:58,944 --> 00:51:00,673
of the royal house of Karlsburg.

963
00:51:00,779 --> 00:51:03,247
In my weekly report to the
royal household in Karlsburg,

964
00:51:03,349 --> 00:51:06,443
I shall include
this unfortunate incident.

965
00:51:06,552 --> 00:51:09,817
The report will go to the
minister of internal affairs.

966
00:51:09,922 --> 00:51:13,085
He will submit it to
the prime minister, Von Mark.

967
00:51:13,192 --> 00:51:16,491
Von Mark will notify
our ambassador in Berlin.

968
00:51:16,595 --> 00:51:18,961
It will be presented to
the German foreign office.

969
00:51:19,064 --> 00:51:22,864
They will submit the matter
to his majesty, the Kaiser.

970
00:51:22,968 --> 00:51:24,492
The Kaiser will communicate

971
00:51:24,603 --> 00:51:26,969
with the chancellor
of Heidelberg university.

972
00:51:27,072 --> 00:51:29,666
The chancellor will communicate
with the burgomaster.

973
00:51:29,775 --> 00:51:31,333
The burgomaster will convene

974
00:51:31,443 --> 00:51:33,502
the aldermen of the city
of Heidelberg.

975
00:51:33,612 --> 00:51:35,978
They will summon you,
Herr Ruder.

976
00:51:36,849 --> 00:51:38,149
What can I do?

977
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:40,015
Dear kind Lutz, my good friend,

978
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:41,950
what do you want me to do?

979
00:51:42,054 --> 00:51:44,045
The prince is my responsibility.

980
00:51:44,156 --> 00:51:46,249
Your niece is yours.

981
00:51:46,358 --> 00:51:48,189
I will warn her.

982
00:51:48,294 --> 00:51:50,194
She will never
bother his highness again.

983
00:51:50,296 --> 00:51:51,729
That is not the solution.

984
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:53,789
His highness
may wish to bother her.

985
00:51:55,034 --> 00:51:56,797
Get rid of her!

986
00:51:56,902 --> 00:51:58,733
My own niece?

987
00:51:58,837 --> 00:52:00,771
My sister's daughter?

988
00:52:00,873 --> 00:52:02,307
Now don't start snivelling!

989
00:52:02,308 --> 00:52:05,106
This is no time for sloppy
sentimentality, Ruder.

990
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:06,734
Exile her.

991
00:52:06,845 --> 00:52:08,779
Vanish her from this place.

992
00:52:12,451 --> 00:52:14,749
Exile her! Vanish her!

993
00:52:14,853 --> 00:52:18,016
Exile her! Vanish her!

994
00:52:18,791 --> 00:52:20,291
Exile her!

995
00:52:22,895 --> 00:52:25,728
Exile her! Vanish her!

996
00:52:25,831 --> 00:52:28,197
Exile her! Vanish her!

997
00:52:35,841 --> 00:52:37,341
Come in.

998
00:52:44,299 --> 00:52:45,600
Kathie.

999
00:52:45,601 --> 00:52:48,434
What's the first thing I taught
you when you came here?

1000
00:52:49,371 --> 00:52:52,169
The customer is always right.
That's right.

1001
00:52:52,274 --> 00:52:53,969
No, it's wrong.

1002
00:52:54,076 --> 00:52:56,067
You mean it wasn't
the first thing I taught you?

1003
00:52:56,178 --> 00:52:57,645
Oh, yes, that's right.

1004
00:52:57,646 --> 00:52:59,375
But that
the customer is always right,

1005
00:52:59,481 --> 00:53:01,415
that's not right, that's wrong.

1006
00:53:01,516 --> 00:53:03,814
Right, wrong, wrong, right.
This I know.

1007
00:53:03,919 --> 00:53:06,479
When you got the prince for
a customer, you got trouble.

1008
00:53:06,588 --> 00:53:08,715
Those people are
always talking to each other.

1009
00:53:08,824 --> 00:53:10,191
The prince
to the prime minister.

1010
00:53:10,192 --> 00:53:11,525
the king to the Kaiser.

1011
00:53:11,526 --> 00:53:13,960
the more they talk,
the more trouble I have got.

1012
00:53:14,062 --> 00:53:16,462
Don't get upset uncle,
there won't be any trouble.

1013
00:53:16,565 --> 00:53:18,192
I knew you would be sensible.

1014
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:19,634
Very sensible.

1015
00:53:19,635 --> 00:53:21,159
I'm leaving in the morning.

1016
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:22,637
In the...

1017
00:53:22,638 --> 00:53:25,573
What? My own niece leaving me?

1018
00:53:25,674 --> 00:53:28,074
Well, as long as he's here,
this is no place for me.

1019
00:53:28,176 --> 00:53:29,676
I'll get another job.

1020
00:53:29,711 --> 00:53:31,975
How... how will I look after you?

1021
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,741
I'm your only family.

1022
00:53:33,849 --> 00:53:35,817
Don't worry uncle,
I'll be all right.

1023
00:53:35,917 --> 00:53:37,417
I do worry.

1024
00:53:37,452 --> 00:53:39,249
Maybe if you try to apologize.

1025
00:53:40,155 --> 00:53:43,591
Why should I apologize?
Because you assaulted him.

1026
00:53:43,692 --> 00:53:45,887
Oh, you know about that.

1027
00:53:45,994 --> 00:53:48,258
And do you know
he tried to get fresh with me?

1028
00:53:48,363 --> 00:53:51,594
But he's a prince, you can not
go around assaulting a prince.

1029
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:53,361
That's why I'm leaving.

1030
00:53:53,468 --> 00:53:55,834
But if you apologize,
everything will be all right.

1031
00:53:55,937 --> 00:53:57,700
What if he gets fresh again?

1032
00:53:58,807 --> 00:54:01,435
With a nice girl like you,
how fresh can he get?

1033
00:54:01,543 --> 00:54:02,743
Oh, with a fellow like him

1034
00:54:02,744 --> 00:54:05,235
I'm not going to
wait around to find out.

1035
00:54:05,347 --> 00:54:07,281
I don't like him myself.

1036
00:54:07,382 --> 00:54:08,974
But if you are
stubborn enough to go,

1037
00:54:09,084 --> 00:54:10,984
to go through the river,

1038
00:54:11,086 --> 00:54:12,610
work at Groswaltz.

1039
00:54:13,689 --> 00:54:14,822
Why Groswaltz?

1040
00:54:14,823 --> 00:54:17,451
Because they are
the customers never ask,

1041
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:20,255
and the head waiter
is my best friend.

1042
00:54:21,196 --> 00:54:22,696
My darling.

1043
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:28,763
Kathie! Kathie! Kathie! Kathie!

1044
00:54:30,572 --> 00:54:32,631
Stop it! Stop it!

1045
00:54:32,741 --> 00:54:34,572
Where is Kathie tonight?

1046
00:54:34,676 --> 00:54:36,176
Don't worry about Kathie.

1047
00:54:36,244 --> 00:54:38,644
I myself
will take care of everything.

1048
00:54:38,747 --> 00:54:40,942
Turn around!
What?

1049
00:54:41,049 --> 00:54:42,549
Turn around!

1050
00:54:47,122 --> 00:54:48,987
Step forward a little.

1051
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,387
That's enough!

1052
00:54:53,495 --> 00:54:55,895
Sorry,
you're no substitute for Kathie.

1053
00:54:55,997 --> 00:54:57,064
Where is she?

1054
00:54:57,065 --> 00:54:58,930
The truth, Ruder, the truth!

1055
00:55:00,635 --> 00:55:02,796
I... sent her away this morning.

1056
00:55:02,904 --> 00:55:04,271
She misbehaved.

1057
00:55:04,272 --> 00:55:06,001
Struck one of the customers.

1058
00:55:06,108 --> 00:55:09,134
Well, if she did, he must have
had it coming to him, uh?

1059
00:55:11,046 --> 00:55:12,546
He certainly did.

1060
00:55:12,614 --> 00:55:14,548
The young gentlemen
want their beer.

1061
00:55:14,649 --> 00:55:16,117
No beer, Ruder.
No beer.

1062
00:55:16,118 --> 00:55:17,184
We want Kathie!

1063
00:55:17,185 --> 00:55:23,249
We want Kathie...

1064
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,200
Where is she?

1065
00:55:38,306 --> 00:55:39,673
Where is who, your highness?

1066
00:55:39,674 --> 00:55:41,574
You know who and you know where.

1067
00:55:41,676 --> 00:55:43,610
Speak up, Ruder.

1068
00:55:43,712 --> 00:55:45,079
I can't.

1069
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:47,173
I can't. My lips are sealed.

1070
00:55:47,282 --> 00:55:48,782
I promise.

1071
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:50,350
It's a matter of honor.

1072
00:55:50,485 --> 00:55:51,985
You could torture me.

1073
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:54,511
Wild horses couldn't
drag it out of me.

1074
00:55:56,458 --> 00:55:58,426
But if your highness
is really angry,

1075
00:55:58,527 --> 00:56:01,519
I wouldn't blame you
if you went across the river,

1076
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:03,291
to Groswaltz. restaurant

1077
00:56:03,398 --> 00:56:04,990
near the park.

1078
00:56:05,867 --> 00:56:07,168
It wouldn't be my fault.

1079
00:56:07,169 --> 00:56:09,501
I'm just angry enough
to do that, Herr Ruder.

1080
00:56:10,939 --> 00:56:12,998
The river boat
leaves every hour.

1081
00:56:41,703 --> 00:56:43,568
Kathie, I'm terribly sorry.

1082
00:56:43,672 --> 00:56:44,705
I'm sorry, too.

1083
00:56:44,706 --> 00:56:46,674
Now... now, go away.

1084
00:56:46,775 --> 00:56:48,108
One linden soup.

1085
00:56:48,109 --> 00:56:49,543
I don't blame you
for being angry,

1086
00:56:49,544 --> 00:56:50,945
but it wasn't my fault.

1087
00:56:50,946 --> 00:56:52,607
I'm not angry.

1088
00:56:52,714 --> 00:56:54,409
One kraut and Frankfurt.

1089
00:56:55,517 --> 00:56:57,508
It won't be as good
as your uncle's.

1090
00:56:57,619 --> 00:56:58,953
Then go back there.

1091
00:56:58,954 --> 00:57:00,120
Not without you.

1092
00:57:00,121 --> 00:57:02,055
Please stop it.
You'll spill the soup.

1093
00:57:02,157 --> 00:57:03,257
Who is he?

1094
00:57:03,258 --> 00:57:04,919
I never saw him before
in my life.

1095
00:57:05,026 --> 00:57:07,051
Outside! I don't know
how you got in here.

1096
00:57:07,162 --> 00:57:09,289
But get out the same way.
Quiet!

1097
00:57:09,397 --> 00:57:10,764
Outside!

1098
00:57:10,765 --> 00:57:12,392
Don't you shout at me!

1099
00:57:14,603 --> 00:57:15,803
Outside!

1100
00:57:15,804 --> 00:57:17,499
You'll regret this impertinence!

1101
00:57:17,606 --> 00:57:18,839
So will you.

1102
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,535
Outside.

1103
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:37,584
Let me go! You'll get me fired.
Exactly why I'm here.

1104
00:57:37,692 --> 00:57:39,819
This maybe a joke to you.
It isn't.

1105
00:57:39,928 --> 00:57:41,953
You're leaving here with me
if I have to drag you.

1106
00:57:42,063 --> 00:57:43,297
Let me go!

1107
00:57:43,298 --> 00:57:44,798
What's going on here?

1108
00:57:46,001 --> 00:57:47,730
She refused to take my order.

1109
00:57:47,836 --> 00:57:49,428
He tried to molest me.

1110
00:57:49,538 --> 00:57:51,038
Really, do I look like
the sort of person

1111
00:57:51,139 --> 00:57:52,606
who would do that kind of thing?

1112
00:57:52,607 --> 00:57:54,438
Frankly, yes!

1113
00:57:54,543 --> 00:57:55,876
I know you students.

1114
00:57:55,877 --> 00:57:57,936
The wild irresponsible lad.

1115
00:57:58,547 --> 00:57:59,880
I shall have to
ask you to leave.

1116
00:57:59,881 --> 00:58:01,712
This is a public eating place.

1117
00:58:01,816 --> 00:58:03,841
I must ask you to leave.

1118
00:58:03,952 --> 00:58:04,919
And if I don't?

1119
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,821
Oh, that's the way he always
gets when he's been drinking.

1120
00:58:07,923 --> 00:58:09,423
Obnoxious!

1121
00:58:09,524 --> 00:58:12,084
Outside
or I shall call the police!

1122
00:58:12,928 --> 00:58:15,021
Go ahead! Call the police!

1123
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:17,098
it will look fine in the papers.

1124
00:58:17,198 --> 00:58:19,792
What will your grandfather say
when he reads about it?

1125
00:58:23,538 --> 00:58:25,062
Outside.

1126
00:58:32,247 --> 00:58:33,747
Oh, Kathie!

1127
00:58:34,015 --> 00:58:35,983
Did you hurt yourself?
Don't touch me!

1128
00:58:36,084 --> 00:58:37,949
Everytime you come near me
I get in trouble.

1129
00:58:38,053 --> 00:58:40,749
You clumsy fool!
You... you stupid girl!

1130
00:58:40,855 --> 00:58:42,022
Don't talk to her like that!

1131
00:58:42,023 --> 00:58:43,957
Shut up!
Look at those broken dishes!

1132
00:58:44,059 --> 00:58:46,323
Is that all you can think about?
Suppose she broke her legs?

1133
00:58:46,428 --> 00:58:47,828
Suppose she cut her face?

1134
00:58:47,829 --> 00:58:48,862
Who cares about the dishes?

1135
00:58:48,863 --> 00:58:50,363
I do.
Who'll pay for it!

1136
00:58:50,432 --> 00:58:51,956
If I feel in the mood I may.

1137
00:58:52,067 --> 00:58:53,534
If you feel in the mood!

1138
00:58:53,535 --> 00:58:55,526
Who do you think you are?
The Kaiser?

1139
00:58:55,637 --> 00:58:56,837
No, but you're getting warm.

1140
00:58:56,838 --> 00:58:59,602
Oh, you crazy students
are all alike.

1141
00:58:59,708 --> 00:59:01,471
Big talk and no money.

1142
00:59:01,576 --> 00:59:03,305
Out or I'll throw you out!

1143
00:59:03,411 --> 00:59:05,242
Try it!
No, no, no fighting.

1144
00:59:05,347 --> 00:59:07,406
Your grandfather
wouldn't like it.

1145
00:59:12,754 --> 00:59:14,254
Even as a favor to your uncle,

1146
00:59:14,322 --> 00:59:15,356
this is too much!

1147
00:59:15,357 --> 00:59:17,120
Oh, I'll pay for the dishes
and I'II...

1148
00:59:17,225 --> 00:59:19,557
No! Turn in your uniform.

1149
00:59:19,661 --> 00:59:21,161
You're through!

1150
00:59:27,402 --> 00:59:28,926
I'm awfully sorry that
this happened,

1151
00:59:29,037 --> 00:59:30,937
but just
a very unfortunate incident.

1152
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:33,030
please excuse, I must apologize.

1153
00:59:39,581 --> 00:59:41,742
Did he fire you?
Thanks to you, he did.

1154
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:43,350
Good.
Now you'll have to come back.

1155
00:59:43,385 --> 00:59:45,751
Only for tonight.
Tomorrow I'll find another job.

1156
00:59:48,023 --> 00:59:50,389
Where are you going?
The ferry land is down this way.

1157
00:59:50,492 --> 00:59:52,722
I'm not going
on the same boat with you!

1158
00:59:52,827 --> 00:59:55,295
But I have to get home, too.
Do you want me to swim?

1159
00:59:55,397 --> 00:59:56,897
I don't care if you drown.

1160
00:59:56,965 --> 00:59:58,796
My grandfather wouldn't like it.

1161
00:59:59,467 --> 01:00:02,436
Come on! We can have the same
argument as we walk along.

1162
01:00:03,772 --> 01:00:05,433
I have nothing to say to you.

1163
01:00:08,209 --> 01:00:10,177
Kathie, please say something.

1164
01:00:11,746 --> 01:00:13,246
Anything.

1165
01:00:16,284 --> 01:00:17,784
It's a lovely night.

1166
01:00:18,653 --> 01:00:19,887
I said it's a lovely night.

1167
01:00:19,888 --> 01:00:21,617
Yeah, lovely night!

1168
01:00:24,225 --> 01:00:25,725
Please come home, Kathie.

1169
01:00:25,794 --> 01:00:27,318
The students are all waiting.

1170
01:00:27,429 --> 01:00:30,057
They swore not to drink any beer
unless you're there.

1171
01:00:30,165 --> 01:00:32,531
They'll change their minds
when they get thirsty.

1172
01:00:32,634 --> 01:00:34,101
But what about me?

1173
01:00:34,102 --> 01:00:36,036
It was awful this morning.
I rang for breakfast.

1174
01:00:36,137 --> 01:00:37,637
And do you know what happen?

1175
01:00:37,639 --> 01:00:39,073
Lutz came in with the tray.

1176
01:00:39,074 --> 01:00:41,634
How dreadful!
But you can always pinch Lutz.

1177
01:00:41,776 --> 01:00:43,835
I could,
but it's not as much fun.

1178
01:00:44,879 --> 01:00:47,006
Kathie,
I've never said this before

1179
01:00:47,115 --> 01:00:49,549
and it's very difficult for me.

1180
01:00:49,651 --> 01:00:52,882
If I offended you last night,
I'm sorry and I apologize.

1181
01:00:54,022 --> 01:00:55,546
Please come back.

1182
01:00:56,458 --> 01:00:57,958
It's better if I don't.

1183
01:00:57,959 --> 01:00:59,459
No, listen.

1184
01:00:59,561 --> 01:01:02,052
It's allright for you to pretend
to be an ordinary student.

1185
01:01:02,163 --> 01:01:03,960
When things get too involved,

1186
01:01:04,065 --> 01:01:06,363
you can always
become a prince again.

1187
01:01:06,468 --> 01:01:08,595
But I can't pretend.

1188
01:01:08,703 --> 01:01:11,103
I can't be anything
but just what I am.

1189
01:01:11,206 --> 01:01:13,436
But nobody wants you
to be anything different.

1190
01:01:13,541 --> 01:01:14,875
Please come back.

1191
01:01:14,876 --> 01:01:16,969
I'll be on my best behavior.

1192
01:01:17,078 --> 01:01:18,773
I promise.

1193
01:01:19,481 --> 01:01:21,176
I don't believe you.

1194
01:01:23,118 --> 01:01:25,109
You're still angry
about last night.

1195
01:01:27,555 --> 01:01:29,955
Last night when I kissed you,
it wasn't the beer.

1196
01:01:52,046 --> 01:01:58,884
Overhead the moon is beaming

1197
01:01:58,987 --> 01:02:03,424
White as blossoms on the bough

1198
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:12,898
Nothing is heard
but the song of a bird

1199
01:02:13,001 --> 01:02:19,907
Filling all the air
with dreaming

1200
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:29,009
Could I hear this song forever?

1201
01:02:30,051 --> 01:02:34,852
Calling to my heart anew

1202
01:02:36,858 --> 01:02:40,521
My darling

1203
01:02:42,163 --> 01:02:49,228
While I drift along forever

1204
01:02:49,737 --> 01:02:57,200
Lost in a dream of you

1205
01:02:59,914 --> 01:03:06,217
I hear your voice in the wind
that stirs the willows

1206
01:03:06,321 --> 01:03:13,557
I see your face in the stars
that shine above

1207
01:03:13,661 --> 01:03:16,425
Hold me closer

1208
01:03:16,531 --> 01:03:19,159
Tonight we love

1209
01:03:19,267 --> 01:03:25,035
The willows bending
the stars that shine

1210
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:32,204
The shore lights blending
they're yours and mine

1211
01:03:33,681 --> 01:03:38,709
Drifting along in my heart
there's a song

1212
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:44,087
and the song in my heart
will not fade

1213
01:03:45,627 --> 01:03:51,827
Oh, hear my serenade

1214
01:03:54,269 --> 01:04:01,300
My moonlight serenade

1215
01:04:13,388 --> 01:04:21,090
Overhead the moon is beaming

1216
01:04:21,195 --> 01:04:26,132
White as bloosoms on the bough

1217
01:04:28,369 --> 01:04:33,864
Nothing is heard
but the song of a bird

1218
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:42,580
Filling all the air
with dreaming

1219
01:04:43,885 --> 01:04:51,223
Could this beauty last forever?

1220
01:04:52,026 --> 01:04:57,259
I would ask for nothing more

1221
01:04:59,033 --> 01:05:01,729
Believe me

1222
01:05:03,271 --> 01:05:11,144
Let this night but live forever

1223
01:05:11,245 --> 01:05:22,850
Forever and ever more

1224
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:44,274
His highness
has never been out so late.

1225
01:05:44,379 --> 01:05:47,007
If anything happens to him,
the king will shoot you.

1226
01:05:47,115 --> 01:05:48,248
That's naturally!

1227
01:05:48,249 --> 01:05:50,183
And if I were king,
I'll have you hang.

1228
01:05:50,284 --> 01:05:52,718
Believe me if you were king,
I would hang myself.

1229
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:55,550
It's the end of you, Ruder,
the absolute end.

1230
01:05:56,657 --> 01:05:59,023
How can you
sit there calmly writing?

1231
01:05:59,127 --> 01:06:00,360
Calmly?

1232
01:06:00,361 --> 01:06:02,295
I'm writing my will.

1233
01:06:04,399 --> 01:06:06,594
Ah, your highness,
you're back safe and sound.

1234
01:06:06,701 --> 01:06:07,801
And happy.

1235
01:06:07,802 --> 01:06:10,134
Uncle Ruder,
I brought Kathie home.

1236
01:06:10,238 --> 01:06:12,729
She's in her room
and she's gonna stay.

1237
01:06:13,574 --> 01:06:15,201
Oh, Lutz,
even though you're interference

1238
01:06:15,309 --> 01:06:17,072
has caused me
a most enjoyable evening.

1239
01:06:17,178 --> 01:06:18,975
In the future, don't interfere!

1240
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:22,174
And Ruder,
from now on, ignore Lutz.

1241
01:06:23,284 --> 01:06:26,117
Lutz, I ignore you.

1242
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:28,917
Just a minute, Herr Ruder,
I warn you.

1243
01:06:29,023 --> 01:06:30,888
Just a minute, Herr Lutz!

1244
01:06:30,992 --> 01:06:32,550
I warn you.

1245
01:06:33,061 --> 01:06:35,928
Make any more trouble
and I talk to my niece, Kathie.

1246
01:06:36,030 --> 01:06:38,055
And Kathie will talk to
her friend, his highness.

1247
01:06:38,166 --> 01:06:40,794
And his highness will talk to
the grandfather, to the king.

1248
01:06:40,902 --> 01:06:42,563
And the king will talk
to the Kaiser.

1249
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:44,661
And the Kaiser will talk
to the other Kaiser.

1250
01:06:44,772 --> 01:06:46,139
And one Kaiser to the other.

1251
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:47,767
And do you know
what will happen to you?

1252
01:06:47,875 --> 01:06:51,436
You will end up pressing pants
in a secondary clothing shop.

1253
01:06:51,546 --> 01:06:53,275
Herr Lutz!

1254
01:06:55,183 --> 01:06:56,683
I ignore you.

1255
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:39,685
Strange things
happen on a summer night

1256
01:07:39,794 --> 01:07:45,357
When the bells begin to chime

1257
01:07:47,335 --> 01:07:52,796
It could happen to someone

1258
01:07:52,907 --> 01:07:56,308
just like you

1259
01:07:57,078 --> 01:08:02,710
Down in Heidelberg

1260
01:08:02,817 --> 01:08:06,685
in summer time

1261
01:08:23,371 --> 01:08:26,829
A "crambambuli"
is as hot as hades

1262
01:08:26,941 --> 01:08:30,502
It's got the kind of kick
You only get from mules

1263
01:08:30,611 --> 01:08:34,274
A "crambambuli"
is not for the ladies

1264
01:08:34,382 --> 01:08:36,009
We've heard It's only fit for
lunatics and fools.

1265
01:08:36,117 --> 01:08:37,384
Kathie,
what's going on up there?

1266
01:08:37,385 --> 01:08:40,252
Herr France is giving a little
beer party for the West Falien.

1267
01:08:40,354 --> 01:08:43,050
It's disturbing.
Tell Herr France to keep quiet.

1268
01:08:43,157 --> 01:08:47,491
Uncle, Count Von Asterburg
is being disturbed.

1269
01:08:47,595 --> 01:08:50,257
Tell Herr France to keep quiet.

1270
01:08:50,364 --> 01:08:54,926
Lutzy, Count Von Asterburg is
being disturbed.

1271
01:08:55,036 --> 01:08:57,004
Tell Herr France to keep quiet.

1272
01:08:59,874 --> 01:09:02,502
And some red cabbage, Karl.
Yes, sir.

1273
01:09:03,244 --> 01:09:05,405
Please, your highness.
Don't stop me now, Lutz!

1274
01:09:05,513 --> 01:09:06,746
I forgot to order food.

1275
01:09:06,747 --> 01:09:08,874
Oh, let me
your highness, please.

1276
01:09:08,983 --> 01:09:10,974
All right, then. Sausage and
red cabbage for everybody.

1277
01:09:11,085 --> 01:09:13,144
And hurry.
Instantly, your highness.

1278
01:09:17,458 --> 01:09:18,958
Ruder.

1279
01:09:18,993 --> 01:09:20,493
Yeah?

1280
01:09:20,661 --> 01:09:22,754
His highness wants
sausage and red cabbage

1281
01:09:22,863 --> 01:09:24,524
for everybody instantly.

1282
01:09:24,632 --> 01:09:26,532
You! Come here.

1283
01:09:31,739 --> 01:09:33,239
What did I hear you say?

1284
01:09:33,274 --> 01:09:35,572
What song shall we sing

1285
01:09:35,676 --> 01:09:38,076
For the day that is here

1286
01:09:38,179 --> 01:09:43,742
None better than Ergo Bibamus

1287
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:46,376
There's plenty of reason

1288
01:09:46,487 --> 01:09:49,012
For making good cheer

1289
01:09:49,123 --> 01:09:54,755
So out ring's the ditty Bibamus

1290
01:09:54,862 --> 01:09:57,558
The heavens are blue

1291
01:09:57,665 --> 01:10:00,600
And the clouds break away

1292
01:10:00,701 --> 01:10:02,999
Joy enters the door

1293
01:10:03,104 --> 01:10:06,130
All is blooming and gay

1294
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:12,736
And there in our sight
all the glory of May

1295
01:10:12,847 --> 01:10:19,150
We chant with devotion "Bibamus"

1296
01:10:20,454 --> 01:10:30,694
We chant with devotion "Bibamus"

1297
01:10:33,434 --> 01:10:35,334
You're the best tenor
we've had in 4 semesters.

1298
01:10:35,436 --> 01:10:36,002
Well...

1299
01:10:36,003 --> 01:10:37,630
I have an uncle
with a Berlin royal opera.

1300
01:10:37,738 --> 01:10:39,763
When you're ready, maybe
I could do something for you.

1301
01:10:39,874 --> 01:10:42,104
Well, thanks, Richter.
That's a good thing to know.

1302
01:10:42,209 --> 01:10:44,643
What were you planning to do
when you get out, Karl?

1303
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:47,914
Go in the family business,
I suppose.

1304
01:10:48,015 --> 01:10:49,015
Oh.

1305
01:10:49,016 --> 01:10:50,643
"Round and round," huh?

1306
01:10:52,553 --> 01:10:54,714
Round and round and round we go

1307
01:10:54,822 --> 01:10:56,722
Drinks around the table

1308
01:10:56,824 --> 01:10:58,951
Lift the flagon, let it flow

1309
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:00,755
Long as we are able

1310
01:11:00,861 --> 01:11:02,361
Count Von Asterburg!

1311
01:11:02,363 --> 01:11:03,129
Gentlemen!

1312
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:05,257
Ah, Count Von Asterburg!
Come in, join us.

1313
01:11:05,399 --> 01:11:07,299
Boys, fill up.

1314
01:11:10,871 --> 01:11:13,066
To your royal highness!

1315
01:11:13,741 --> 01:11:15,709
In Heidelberg, I'm a student.

1316
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:18,335
Also, crown prince of Karlsburg.

1317
01:11:18,446 --> 01:11:21,040
Forgive me for failing to
recognize your highness.

1318
01:11:21,148 --> 01:11:23,582
I'm sorry you did.
I enjoy being Herr France.

1319
01:11:23,684 --> 01:11:25,982
I'm sorry
I spoiled your little joke,

1320
01:11:26,087 --> 01:11:29,523
but your highness will have even
more fun with the Sax Blusean.

1321
01:11:29,623 --> 01:11:31,091
You forget Count Von Asterburg,

1322
01:11:31,092 --> 01:11:33,458
I've already pledged myself
to the West Falien.

1323
01:11:33,561 --> 01:11:36,291
My dear Lucas, surely I
don't have to explain to you

1324
01:11:36,397 --> 01:11:38,865
that his highness'
rightful place is with us.

1325
01:11:38,966 --> 01:11:41,264
If your highness wish to change
his mind, we will understand.

1326
01:11:41,369 --> 01:11:43,303
And give up my friends?
Certainly not!

1327
01:11:43,404 --> 01:11:45,531
I refuse to enter your corps.

1328
01:11:45,639 --> 01:11:47,937
I'm perfectly satisfied
with the West Falien.

1329
01:11:48,042 --> 01:11:49,634
But it's completely
against tradition.

1330
01:11:49,744 --> 01:11:51,302
Oh, don't take it
so seriously, Count.

1331
01:11:51,412 --> 01:11:53,880
We're all at the same university
and the same beer party.

1332
01:11:53,981 --> 01:11:55,281
Let's enjoy ourselves.

1333
01:11:55,282 --> 01:11:58,445
Membership in the Sax Blusean,
corps is not likely offered,

1334
01:11:58,552 --> 01:12:00,713
nor has it ever been refused.

1335
01:12:00,821 --> 01:12:03,915
It's a serious matter
to insult an entire corps.

1336
01:12:04,024 --> 01:12:06,151
Fortunately for your highness,

1337
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:09,388
I do not have the privilege
of demanding satisfaction.

1338
01:12:11,298 --> 01:12:12,732
I grant you that privilege.

1339
01:12:12,733 --> 01:12:15,463
Karl, it's forbidden to duel
with a member of reigning house.

1340
01:12:15,569 --> 01:12:17,069
I'm a student here.

1341
01:12:17,104 --> 01:12:19,538
I accept your challenge
as Herr France.

1342
01:12:21,175 --> 01:12:23,700
Lucas, Richter,
arrange for time and place.

1343
01:13:36,851 --> 01:13:37,817
It's deep enough.

1344
01:13:37,818 --> 01:13:39,911
Is the gentleman's honor
satisfied?

1345
01:13:40,521 --> 01:13:41,321
It is.

1346
01:13:41,322 --> 01:13:42,846
Von Asterburg.

1347
01:13:42,957 --> 01:13:44,549
Your highness.

1348
01:13:51,799 --> 01:13:54,324
Is it over?
It's a beautiful cut.

1349
01:13:54,435 --> 01:13:55,935
Straight as an arrow.

1350
01:13:56,003 --> 01:13:57,868
He's very proud of it.

1351
01:14:16,156 --> 01:14:19,091
Kathie! Kathie! I'm all right.

1352
01:14:20,194 --> 01:14:21,494
You didn't have to worry.

1353
01:14:21,495 --> 01:14:23,725
Who says I'm worried?
I not worried.

1354
01:14:23,831 --> 01:14:26,823
Even if you've been killed...
I'm sorry I upset you.

1355
01:14:26,934 --> 01:14:28,458
I'm not upset.

1356
01:14:28,602 --> 01:14:30,502
It's a matter of complete
indifference to me

1357
01:14:30,604 --> 01:14:32,231
what happens to you.

1358
01:14:32,339 --> 01:14:35,570
Nobody's ever been so violently
indifferent to me before.

1359
01:14:35,943 --> 01:14:40,277
It's silly for grown man to try
and kill each other for nothing.

1360
01:14:43,918 --> 01:14:46,614
It's the first time
anyone has ever cried over me.

1361
01:14:50,190 --> 01:14:57,596
Deep in my heart, dear

1362
01:14:58,732 --> 01:15:03,795
I have a dream of you

1363
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:12,411
Fashioned of starlight

1364
01:15:13,013 --> 01:15:19,350
Fragrant with roses and dew

1365
01:15:21,722 --> 01:15:28,218
Our paths may sever

1366
01:15:29,763 --> 01:15:36,999
But I'll remember forever

1367
01:15:38,572 --> 01:15:45,410
Deep in my heart, dear

1368
01:15:48,482 --> 01:15:55,217
I'll always dream of you

1369
01:15:57,658 --> 01:16:02,618
I've waited a lifetime
for someone to say

1370
01:16:03,597 --> 01:16:07,727
The things you are saying to me

1371
01:16:09,269 --> 01:16:13,603
And, darling
I mean every word that I say

1372
01:16:14,441 --> 01:16:19,037
Just look in my eyes
and you'll see

1373
01:16:20,414 --> 01:16:25,511
You smile and my tears
have all melted away

1374
01:16:26,353 --> 01:16:31,518
My worries were all false alarms

1375
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:39,989
It looks like
the start of a beautiful day

1376
01:16:40,734 --> 01:16:45,671
Just holding you here in my arms

1377
01:16:47,408 --> 01:16:51,572
With you everyday's

1378
01:16:53,047 --> 01:16:57,040
a beautiful day

1379
01:16:58,686 --> 01:17:06,252
As long as I'm here in your arms

1380
01:17:09,363 --> 01:17:16,599
Deep in my heart, dear

1381
01:17:17,805 --> 01:17:22,765
I have a dream of you

1382
01:17:25,045 --> 01:17:31,951
Fashioned of starlight

1383
01:17:32,786 --> 01:17:38,952
Fragrant with roses and dew

1384
01:17:41,729 --> 01:17:48,897
Our paths may sever

1385
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:58,735
But I'll remember forever

1386
01:18:00,514 --> 01:18:08,285
Deep in my heart, dear

1387
01:18:11,291 --> 01:18:18,527
I'll always dream of you

1388
01:18:27,941 --> 01:18:31,433
(masked ball)

1389
01:19:51,658 --> 01:19:53,523
Oh, let's go on like this
for the rest of our lives

1390
01:19:53,627 --> 01:19:55,356
forever, ever and ever!

1391
01:19:55,462 --> 01:19:56,762
Oh, it would be wonderful, Karl,

1392
01:19:56,763 --> 01:19:59,561
forever and ever and ever!
Oh, why not?

1393
01:19:59,666 --> 01:20:01,166
Kathie, come away with me.

1394
01:20:01,268 --> 01:20:02,768
I've always wanted to
see the world.

1395
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:04,337
Do you think it's really round?

1396
01:20:04,338 --> 01:20:06,272
Kathie, I mean it.
Come away with me.

1397
01:20:06,373 --> 01:20:07,707
Princes don't disappear.

1398
01:20:07,708 --> 01:20:09,208
What would we do?
Where would we go?

1399
01:20:09,309 --> 01:20:09,942
It doesn't matter.

1400
01:20:09,943 --> 01:20:12,377
Everywhere! Anywhere!
We'd be together.

1401
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:14,845
Just the two of us,
Kathie, together.

1402
01:20:14,948 --> 01:20:17,212
Together. But it's impossible.

1403
01:20:17,317 --> 01:20:18,651
But why don't we try it?

1404
01:20:18,652 --> 01:20:20,152
We can change at the inn.

1405
01:20:20,153 --> 01:20:21,187
No one is there.

1406
01:20:21,188 --> 01:20:22,488
The night train
out of Heidelberg,

1407
01:20:22,489 --> 01:20:25,185
to Paris in the morning.
They'll never find us.

1408
01:20:25,292 --> 01:20:28,523
Oh, Kathie, I love you. There's
nothing else that matters.

1409
01:20:28,629 --> 01:20:30,494
Oh, I adore you.

1410
01:20:30,597 --> 01:20:32,097
Come on!

1411
01:21:01,695 --> 01:21:04,061
Kathie, hurry,
before anyone comes back.

1412
01:21:08,936 --> 01:21:10,767
Hurry, Kathie, hurry!

1413
01:21:12,839 --> 01:21:14,339
Karl.

1414
01:21:14,341 --> 01:21:16,104
Kathie, what's the matter?

1415
01:21:17,978 --> 01:21:19,969
I can't go, Karl.

1416
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,672
Not to Paris, not any place.

1417
01:21:21,782 --> 01:21:23,015
But Kathie, a minute ago...

1418
01:21:23,016 --> 01:21:24,516
The carnival is over.

1419
01:21:24,584 --> 01:21:26,677
Not the same anymore.

1420
01:21:26,787 --> 01:21:29,813
This is my uncle's inn.
I'm Kathie Ruder. I work here.

1421
01:21:30,590 --> 01:21:32,649
And you're his highness,
Karl France.

1422
01:21:32,759 --> 01:21:36,490
The world is not big enough for
us to run away from that, Karl.

1423
01:21:36,596 --> 01:21:39,224
They'd never let us alone
in a week or a month...

1424
01:21:39,333 --> 01:21:42,461
But even a week is better
than nothing, a day, an hour.

1425
01:21:42,569 --> 01:21:45,231
They couldn't
take that away from us.

1426
01:21:45,339 --> 01:21:47,830
We'll have it
for the rest of our lives.

1427
01:21:47,941 --> 01:21:50,307
No, Karl. No!

1428
01:22:19,339 --> 01:22:23,139
Tonight was just a masquerade

1429
01:22:24,044 --> 01:22:27,104
Tomorrow just another day

1430
01:22:28,648 --> 01:22:32,084
Let come whatever

1431
01:22:32,185 --> 01:22:35,086
Tonight or never

1432
01:22:35,188 --> 01:22:38,885
I'll throw the mask away

1433
01:22:40,761 --> 01:22:44,162
Beloved!

1434
01:22:44,264 --> 01:22:48,564
With all my heart, I love you

1435
01:22:48,668 --> 01:22:51,330
With every breath I pray

1436
01:22:51,438 --> 01:22:55,966
Someday you will be mine

1437
01:22:57,344 --> 01:23:00,438
Summer or spring

1438
01:23:00,547 --> 01:23:03,744
winter or fall

1439
01:23:04,718 --> 01:23:07,414
You are my life

1440
01:23:07,521 --> 01:23:11,218
my love, my all

1441
01:23:14,327 --> 01:23:17,421
Beloved!

1442
01:23:17,531 --> 01:23:21,092
The very stars above you

1443
01:23:21,701 --> 01:23:24,397
Are jealous of the way

1444
01:23:24,504 --> 01:23:28,406
Your eyes sparkle and shine

1445
01:23:30,243 --> 01:23:33,576
Day after day

1446
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:36,478
Near or apart

1447
01:23:38,218 --> 01:23:41,415
I try to say

1448
01:23:41,521 --> 01:23:45,480
Be still, my trembling heart

1449
01:23:47,394 --> 01:23:50,386
But try though I may

1450
01:23:50,497 --> 01:23:55,457
I cannot hide
this passion inside

1451
01:23:56,503 --> 01:23:59,028
That won't be denied

1452
01:24:00,407 --> 01:24:07,370
If this be madness

1453
01:24:07,981 --> 01:24:14,318
Then call it madness

1454
01:24:14,421 --> 01:24:16,116
I only know

1455
01:24:16,223 --> 01:24:21,923
I'll never rest
till you are mine

1456
01:24:24,264 --> 01:24:26,926
Beloved!

1457
01:24:27,033 --> 01:24:31,060
Believe me when I tell you

1458
01:24:31,204 --> 01:24:35,732
From now
until the last bright star

1459
01:24:35,842 --> 01:24:39,243
fades from the blue

1460
01:24:39,346 --> 01:24:43,806
Now and forever

1461
01:24:43,917 --> 01:24:47,978
Whatever I do

1462
01:24:50,357 --> 01:24:59,664
Beloved, I love you

1463
01:25:06,773 --> 01:25:08,400
Oh, Karl!

1464
01:25:09,442 --> 01:25:11,273
Kathie!

1465
01:25:11,378 --> 01:25:12,878
We must hurry.

1466
01:25:22,622 --> 01:25:24,317
I'm ready.

1467
01:25:29,262 --> 01:25:31,127
Your highness.

1468
01:25:31,431 --> 01:25:33,422
Forgive the intrusion,
your highness.

1469
01:25:33,533 --> 01:25:36,263
I have urgent instructions
from his majesty.

1470
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:38,470
Urgent?

1471
01:25:38,471 --> 01:25:40,132
His majesty is ill.

1472
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:42,071
He wishes to see you.

1473
01:25:44,144 --> 01:25:46,544
How long has he been ill,
Von Mark.

1474
01:25:46,646 --> 01:25:48,146
How serious is it?

1475
01:25:48,281 --> 01:25:50,112
His majesty is an old man.

1476
01:25:50,217 --> 01:25:53,118
At his age, no illness
is to be taken lightly.

1477
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:55,120
We can discuss it as we go.

1478
01:25:55,222 --> 01:25:56,849
Karl, it's the most...

1479
01:25:56,957 --> 01:25:58,948
I beg your pardon.

1480
01:26:00,393 --> 01:26:05,023
Kathie,
I have to go back to Karlsburg.

1481
01:26:06,099 --> 01:26:08,158
But it's
only for a little while.

1482
01:26:08,268 --> 01:26:10,828
The prime minister
has just come for me.

1483
01:26:10,937 --> 01:26:12,495
My grandfather is ill.

1484
01:26:12,606 --> 01:26:14,801
He's a husky old man.
He'll live forever.

1485
01:26:16,476 --> 01:26:18,603
I'll be back.

1486
01:26:18,712 --> 01:26:19,712
Of course.

1487
01:26:19,713 --> 01:26:21,681
I promise you I'll be back.

1488
01:26:23,016 --> 01:26:24,711
I know you will, Karl.

1489
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:36,160
It would
have been a beautiful day.

1490
01:26:37,397 --> 01:26:40,127
There'll be
many other days, Kathie.

1491
01:26:40,233 --> 01:26:42,701
And each day more beautiful
than the last.

1492
01:26:54,347 --> 01:26:56,247
I'll be back.

1493
01:27:06,559 --> 01:27:08,083
You'll never come back.

1494
01:27:13,667 --> 01:27:15,601
His highness, Karl France.

1495
01:27:15,702 --> 01:27:16,769
Here. Here.

1496
01:27:16,770 --> 01:27:18,270
All right. All right.

1497
01:27:22,142 --> 01:27:24,474
Tell him to come in.

1498
01:27:34,688 --> 01:27:36,485
Your majesty.
Your highness.

1499
01:27:39,726 --> 01:27:41,489
Welcome home, Karl.

1500
01:27:41,594 --> 01:27:43,824
Let me have a good look at you.

1501
01:27:45,965 --> 01:27:48,456
Heidelberg obviously
agrees with you.

1502
01:27:48,568 --> 01:27:50,002
You're looking well.

1503
01:27:50,003 --> 01:27:52,471
What's more important
is that you look well.

1504
01:27:52,572 --> 01:27:54,506
Von Mark
was so depressing that...

1505
01:27:54,607 --> 01:27:55,974
You expected to find...

1506
01:27:55,975 --> 01:27:59,411
a doggerel old wreck
wasting away in bed, did you?

1507
01:27:59,512 --> 01:28:01,537
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you.

1508
01:28:01,648 --> 01:28:03,843
Von Mark is an alarmist.

1509
01:28:03,950 --> 01:28:06,350
I'm considerably
better as you can see,

1510
01:28:06,453 --> 01:28:07,953
and after a few weeks
in Switzerland,

1511
01:28:07,954 --> 01:28:10,047
I will be quite myself again.

1512
01:28:11,024 --> 01:28:12,958
I'm so happy, grandfather.

1513
01:28:13,059 --> 01:28:15,152
For your sake
as well as for mine.

1514
01:28:15,261 --> 01:28:17,729
As you say, Heidelberg
agrees with me, and...

1515
01:28:17,831 --> 01:28:19,890
I'm extremely
anxious to get back.

1516
01:28:20,934 --> 01:28:23,027
You are not going back.

1517
01:28:23,136 --> 01:28:25,434
This illness has
made it quite clear to me

1518
01:28:25,538 --> 01:28:28,200
that even
I cannot go on forever.

1519
01:28:28,308 --> 01:28:29,900
And it is not my intention

1520
01:28:30,009 --> 01:28:32,978
to leave with important
business unfinished.

1521
01:28:33,079 --> 01:28:36,071
I have been
in communication with the queen.

1522
01:28:36,182 --> 01:28:39,276
Your marriage will
take place very shortly.

1523
01:28:39,386 --> 01:28:42,150
But grandfather...
Formal papers are being drawn up

1524
01:28:42,255 --> 01:28:44,314
The details have been arranged.

1525
01:28:46,025 --> 01:28:48,255
Except for one detail.

1526
01:28:48,928 --> 01:28:51,089
I am not
in love with the princess.

1527
01:28:51,197 --> 01:28:52,531
It is of no importance.

1528
01:28:52,532 --> 01:28:55,057
It's of
the utmost importance to me.

1529
01:28:55,168 --> 01:28:57,602
That little bar maid, isn't it?

1530
01:28:58,872 --> 01:29:00,533
How do you know about Kathie?

1531
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:03,006
It's my business to know,
my boy.

1532
01:29:03,109 --> 01:29:06,169
I am not criticizing, but surely

1533
01:29:06,279 --> 01:29:08,770
you can't take this seriously.

1534
01:29:08,882 --> 01:29:10,509
It is serious.

1535
01:29:16,956 --> 01:29:19,083
I'm in love with Kathie.

1536
01:29:19,526 --> 01:29:22,791
Bar maids are
as plentiful as gooseberries.

1537
01:29:22,896 --> 01:29:25,831
There'll be plenty
of other young ladies.

1538
01:29:25,932 --> 01:29:27,099
Not for me.

1539
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:31,764
Then the princess will find you
an unusually faithful husband.

1540
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:36,035
And if I don't wish to marry?

1541
01:29:36,142 --> 01:29:38,007
This marriage is a state affair.

1542
01:29:38,111 --> 01:29:40,045
I have never permitted

1543
01:29:40,146 --> 01:29:43,604
personal feelings
to interfere with duty.

1544
01:29:43,716 --> 01:29:46,207
I demand the same conduct
from you.

1545
01:29:46,319 --> 01:29:48,913
All my life I've been told
what to do, and I've done it.

1546
01:29:49,956 --> 01:29:51,685
But not anymore.

1547
01:29:51,791 --> 01:29:53,520
I've had a taste of freedom.

1548
01:29:53,626 --> 01:29:56,186
Freedom is a luxury
that no king can afford.

1549
01:29:56,296 --> 01:29:58,161
Then I don't want to be king.

1550
01:29:58,264 --> 01:30:00,698
What else
do you think you might be?

1551
01:30:01,901 --> 01:30:03,493
A man.

1552
01:30:04,037 --> 01:30:06,198
To run away from your duty,

1553
01:30:06,306 --> 01:30:10,402
your training, your obligation,
will hardly make a man of you.

1554
01:30:10,543 --> 01:30:13,034
If you're not a king,
you are nothing.

1555
01:30:13,146 --> 01:30:15,307
Least of all, a man.

1556
01:30:18,751 --> 01:30:20,251
But grandfather...

1557
01:30:20,286 --> 01:30:23,551
I am not talking
as your grandfather,

1558
01:30:23,656 --> 01:30:25,783
but as your king.

1559
01:30:26,860 --> 01:30:29,124
The discussion is over,
your highness.

1560
01:30:30,830 --> 01:30:32,593
Your majesty.

1561
01:30:56,256 --> 01:30:59,020
Eins, Swei, Drei, Vier

1562
01:30:59,125 --> 01:31:02,288
Lift your stein
and drink your beer

1563
01:31:02,395 --> 01:31:05,296
Eins, Swei, Drei, Vier

1564
01:31:05,398 --> 01:31:08,424
Lift your stein
and drink your beer

1565
01:31:08,535 --> 01:31:10,730
Drink! Drink! Drink!

1566
01:31:10,837 --> 01:31:13,032
To eyes that are bright as stars

1567
01:31:13,139 --> 01:31:14,902
When they're shining on me

1568
01:31:15,008 --> 01:31:16,908
Drink! Drink! Drink!

1569
01:31:17,010 --> 01:31:18,978
To lips that are red and sweet

1570
01:31:19,078 --> 01:31:21,103
As the fruit on the tree

1571
01:31:21,214 --> 01:31:22,772
Here's a hope

1572
01:31:22,882 --> 01:31:25,851
That those bright eyes
will shine

1573
01:31:25,952 --> 01:31:32,915
Lovingly,
longingly soon into mine

1574
01:31:33,026 --> 01:31:36,860
May those lips
that are red and sweet

1575
01:31:36,963 --> 01:31:41,400
Tonight with joy
my own lips meet

1576
01:31:41,501 --> 01:31:42,901
Drink! Drink! Drink!

1577
01:31:42,902 --> 01:31:44,460
Let the toast start

1578
01:31:44,571 --> 01:31:47,836
May young hearts never part

1579
01:31:47,941 --> 01:31:50,102
Drink! Drink! Drink!

1580
01:31:50,209 --> 01:31:53,701
Let every true lover
salute his sweetheart

1581
01:31:53,813 --> 01:31:55,313
Let's drink!

1582
01:31:57,584 --> 01:31:59,211
How is his majesty?
Splendid.

1583
01:31:59,319 --> 01:32:02,049
He told me so himself.
This was all a trick.

1584
01:32:02,155 --> 01:32:05,591
We're going back to Heidelberg.
Lutz, get the luggage.

1585
01:32:06,926 --> 01:32:08,655
It was extremely clever of you,
Von Mark,

1586
01:32:08,761 --> 01:32:11,025
to get me here by telling me
his majesty was ill.

1587
01:32:11,130 --> 01:32:13,894
I'm going back to Heidelberg.
You may tell his majesty that.

1588
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,100
Please your highness,

1589
01:32:15,101 --> 01:32:17,763
his majesty is much too ill
to be upset.

1590
01:32:17,870 --> 01:32:19,963
If he were really ill,
I would not leave him.

1591
01:32:20,073 --> 01:32:21,938
He's going on a trip
to Switzerland.

1592
01:32:22,041 --> 01:32:23,872
Not Switzerland
nor any place else.

1593
01:32:23,977 --> 01:32:25,143
The doctors will tell you that

1594
01:32:25,144 --> 01:32:26,975
his majesty is
a great deal sicker

1595
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:29,981
than either you or he realizes.

1596
01:32:30,683 --> 01:32:32,446
How can I believe you, Von Mark?

1597
01:32:32,552 --> 01:32:34,611
Your highness
suspects me of trickery.

1598
01:32:34,721 --> 01:32:36,655
Your highness is quite right.

1599
01:32:36,756 --> 01:32:39,384
But I'm deceiving
your grandfather, not you.

1600
01:32:39,492 --> 01:32:41,824
I have served my king too long
to have the heart

1601
01:32:41,928 --> 01:32:43,919
to tell him
what the doctors say.

1602
01:32:44,030 --> 01:32:45,725
It is matter of a few days,

1603
01:32:45,832 --> 01:32:48,323
an hour, any moment.

1604
01:33:39,285 --> 01:33:43,949
I'll walk with God

1605
01:33:44,057 --> 01:33:47,720
from this day on

1606
01:33:49,095 --> 01:33:53,122
His helping hand

1607
01:33:53,232 --> 01:33:56,599
I'll lean upon

1608
01:33:58,438 --> 01:34:03,273
This is my prayer

1609
01:34:03,376 --> 01:34:07,278
my humble plea

1610
01:34:08,815 --> 01:34:16,221
May the Lord be ever with me

1611
01:34:20,226 --> 01:34:24,060
There is no death

1612
01:34:24,163 --> 01:34:27,997
Though eyes grow dim

1613
01:34:29,469 --> 01:34:33,667
There is no fear

1614
01:34:33,806 --> 01:34:37,401
When I'm near to him

1615
01:34:39,278 --> 01:34:46,775
I'll lean on him forever

1616
01:34:46,886 --> 01:34:55,555
And he'll forsake me never

1617
01:34:58,264 --> 01:35:04,032
He will not fail me

1618
01:35:04,137 --> 01:35:09,541
As long as my faith is strong

1619
01:35:10,643 --> 01:35:18,311
Whatever road I may walk along

1620
01:35:23,156 --> 01:35:28,355
I'll walk with God

1621
01:35:28,461 --> 01:35:33,330
I'll take his hand

1622
01:35:33,432 --> 01:35:37,732
I'll talk with God

1623
01:35:37,837 --> 01:35:41,637
He'll understand

1624
01:35:41,741 --> 01:35:46,678
I'll pray to him

1625
01:35:46,779 --> 01:35:50,579
Each day to him

1626
01:35:50,683 --> 01:35:54,210
And he'll hear the words

1627
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:57,448
That I say

1628
01:35:58,691 --> 01:36:07,099
His hand will
guide my throne and rod

1629
01:36:07,867 --> 01:36:12,600
And I'll never walk alone

1630
01:36:12,705 --> 01:36:21,977
While I walk with God

1631
01:36:38,631 --> 01:36:40,326
Well, Lutz,
I suppose everything is ready.

1632
01:36:40,433 --> 01:36:43,095
Your majesty's luggage is
already aboard the royal train.

1633
01:36:43,202 --> 01:36:44,002
Good.

1634
01:36:44,003 --> 01:36:46,233
The people of Karlsburg
are waiting eagerly

1635
01:36:46,339 --> 01:36:49,069
to welcome Princess Johanna
as your bride.

1636
01:36:49,175 --> 01:36:52,110
This marriage
is a very happy event.

1637
01:36:52,211 --> 01:36:53,078
Is it, Lutz?

1638
01:36:53,079 --> 01:36:55,172
For they've been
waiting 2 years for it.

1639
01:36:55,281 --> 01:36:57,806
I wish
your Majesty every happiness.

1640
01:36:59,352 --> 01:37:00,910
Let's drink to that.

1641
01:37:01,988 --> 01:37:04,047
It's all right, Lutz, relax.

1642
01:37:04,156 --> 01:37:06,090
Is that a command, your majesty?

1643
01:37:06,192 --> 01:37:08,217
Not at all,
but I wish you would.

1644
01:37:08,327 --> 01:37:10,318
Your wish is my command.

1645
01:37:11,864 --> 01:37:13,889
This is my bachelor party, Lutz.

1646
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,662
At a time like this,
a man needs a friend.

1647
01:37:16,769 --> 01:37:18,760
We are friends, aren't we?

1648
01:37:18,871 --> 01:37:20,736
I hope not, your majesty.

1649
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:22,364
Would the idea upset you, Lutz?

1650
01:37:22,475 --> 01:37:24,204
Indeed it does, your majesty.

1651
01:37:24,310 --> 01:37:26,335
It is an honor
to put on a king's shoes.

1652
01:37:26,445 --> 01:37:28,538
But I certainly wouldn't do it
for a friend.

1653
01:37:28,648 --> 01:37:30,548
If I must treat your majesty
as an equal,

1654
01:37:30,650 --> 01:37:32,618
then Hubert would
treat me as an equal.

1655
01:37:32,718 --> 01:37:36,313
And I assure you, your majesty
Hubert is not my equal.

1656
01:37:39,058 --> 01:37:40,787
Forgive me, Lutz.

1657
01:37:42,328 --> 01:37:43,628
I shall endeavor
to behave a manner

1658
01:37:43,629 --> 01:37:46,689
more suitable to the dignity
of our relationship.

1659
01:37:52,138 --> 01:37:54,436
I'm sorry to interrupt,
your majesty.

1660
01:37:54,540 --> 01:37:55,874
Please forgive me, but this...

1661
01:37:55,875 --> 01:37:57,142
this is impossible.

1662
01:37:57,143 --> 01:38:01,273
I'm much too old and fat
to start wearing uniforms.

1663
01:38:02,348 --> 01:38:05,283
Oh, I must resign
as privy counsellor.

1664
01:38:07,119 --> 01:38:09,587
My dear doctor, if you
weren't a privy counsellor,

1665
01:38:09,689 --> 01:38:11,623
you couldn't be
in the official party.

1666
01:38:11,724 --> 01:38:13,316
If you weren't
in the official party,

1667
01:38:13,426 --> 01:38:14,926
you couldn't
come to North Hausen.

1668
01:38:14,961 --> 01:38:16,519
And if you
weren't at North Hausen,

1669
01:38:16,629 --> 01:38:18,129
you couldn't be at the wedding.

1670
01:38:18,197 --> 01:38:20,495
And then I couldn't
have you as my best man.

1671
01:38:20,599 --> 01:38:23,363
I'm afraid
I must refuse your resignation.

1672
01:38:23,469 --> 01:38:27,166
Ah, what I go through
for friendship.

1673
01:38:27,273 --> 01:38:30,071
Besides you can't
leave me alone with Lutz.

1674
01:38:30,176 --> 01:38:30,909
Why not?

1675
01:38:30,910 --> 01:38:32,741
He doesn't approve of me.
No?

1676
01:38:32,845 --> 01:38:34,608
Ever since Heidelberg.

1677
01:38:37,283 --> 01:38:39,513
We thought of everything,

1678
01:38:39,618 --> 01:38:42,178
except that one day
I'd have to come back.

1679
01:38:42,288 --> 01:38:44,347
And that I'd be changed.

1680
01:38:45,791 --> 01:38:47,759
But that Karlsburg wouldn't be.

1681
01:38:48,627 --> 01:38:52,028
Perhaps after all,
Heidelberg was a mistake.

1682
01:38:54,266 --> 01:38:56,291
I don't regret a minute of it.

1683
01:39:07,279 --> 01:39:09,144
No, thank you, Lutz.

1684
01:39:09,348 --> 01:39:11,077
One moment.

1685
01:39:11,183 --> 01:39:13,743
As a privy counsellor,
I'm not permitted to drink

1686
01:39:13,853 --> 01:39:15,548
unless your majesty does.

1687
01:39:15,654 --> 01:39:18,623
But if I can
wear this uniform for you,

1688
01:39:18,724 --> 01:39:21,318
surely you can drink
a small brandy for my sake.

1689
01:39:25,131 --> 01:39:26,962
Silentium!
Silentium!

1690
01:39:27,066 --> 01:39:29,500
A salamander
for the privy counsellor.

1691
01:39:34,507 --> 01:39:35,540
Long life.

1692
01:39:35,541 --> 01:39:37,372
And pleasant memories.

1693
01:39:37,476 --> 01:39:38,976
And pleasant memories.

1694
01:39:39,111 --> 01:39:41,170
To Heidelberg.
Heidelberg!

1695
01:39:47,653 --> 01:39:50,178
Golden days

1696
01:39:50,289 --> 01:39:54,055
in the sunshine
of our happy youth

1697
01:39:54,994 --> 01:39:57,394
Golden days

1698
01:39:57,496 --> 01:40:01,057
Full of gaiety and full of truth

1699
01:40:02,501 --> 01:40:04,435
In our hearts

1700
01:40:04,537 --> 01:40:08,132
We remember them all else above

1701
01:40:09,708 --> 01:40:11,869
Golden days

1702
01:40:11,977 --> 01:40:16,437
Days of youth and love

1703
01:40:19,151 --> 01:40:21,016
How we laugh

1704
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:24,783
With a joy
that only love can bring

1705
01:40:26,659 --> 01:40:32,962
Looking back
through memory's haze

1706
01:40:34,467 --> 01:40:39,598
We will know
life has nothing sweeter

1707
01:40:39,705 --> 01:40:44,199
than it's springtime

1708
01:40:45,644 --> 01:40:52,345
Golden days when we're young

1709
01:40:54,420 --> 01:41:01,019
Golden days

1710
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:09,424
Well, good night, my boy.

1711
01:41:09,535 --> 01:41:10,935
See you in the morning.

1712
01:41:10,936 --> 01:41:13,063
In the morning at North Hausen.

1713
01:41:13,205 --> 01:41:14,968
Good night, Herr Doctor.

1714
01:41:15,074 --> 01:41:16,871
Good night.

1715
01:41:30,289 --> 01:41:32,689
It would
have been a beautiful day.

1716
01:41:33,526 --> 01:41:35,790
There'll be other days, Kathie.

1717
01:41:35,895 --> 01:41:38,420
And each day
more beautiful than the last.

1718
01:41:40,833 --> 01:41:42,767
I'll be back.

1719
01:41:52,411 --> 01:41:53,144
Your majesty.

1720
01:41:53,145 --> 01:41:55,613
Lutz, you will have
the train stop at Heidelberg.

1721
01:41:55,714 --> 01:41:56,848
Me?

1722
01:41:56,849 --> 01:41:59,181
But your majesty,
it's not on our schedule.

1723
01:41:59,285 --> 01:42:01,116
It is now, Lutz.

1724
01:42:01,654 --> 01:42:03,554
It is now.

1725
01:42:08,827 --> 01:42:10,852
Drink! Drink! Drink!

1726
01:42:10,963 --> 01:42:13,124
To eyes that are bright as stars

1727
01:42:13,265 --> 01:42:15,392
When they're shining on me

1728
01:42:15,501 --> 01:42:17,765
Drink! Drink! Drink!

1729
01:42:17,870 --> 01:42:20,270
To lips that are red and sweet

1730
01:42:20,372 --> 01:42:22,704
As the fruit on the tree

1731
01:42:22,808 --> 01:42:24,075
Here's a hope

1732
01:42:24,076 --> 01:42:26,476
That those bright eyes
will shine

1733
01:42:26,579 --> 01:42:30,913
Lovingly,
longingly soon into mine

1734
01:42:31,016 --> 01:42:34,452
May those lips
that are red and sweet

1735
01:42:34,553 --> 01:42:39,047
Tonight with joy
my own lips meet

1736
01:42:39,158 --> 01:42:40,989
Drink! Drink! Drink!

1737
01:42:41,093 --> 01:42:42,593
Let the toast start

1738
01:42:42,595 --> 01:42:45,996
May young hearts never part
Kathie.

1739
01:42:47,933 --> 01:42:49,491
Karl.

1740
01:42:51,570 --> 01:42:53,435
What are you doing here?

1741
01:42:53,539 --> 01:42:55,564
I'm on my way to North Hausen.

1742
01:42:57,142 --> 01:42:59,007
I'm gonna be married.

1743
01:42:59,845 --> 01:43:02,439
Yes, I know.
It was in the papers.

1744
01:43:02,548 --> 01:43:04,675
It's the way it should be.

1745
01:43:06,652 --> 01:43:09,314
I never thought
I'd see you again.

1746
01:43:09,421 --> 01:43:11,582
I told you I'd come back.

1747
01:43:12,558 --> 01:43:14,185
Yes, you did.

1748
01:43:14,326 --> 01:43:16,988
That was
when you were a student here.

1749
01:43:17,096 --> 01:43:19,428
We lived in the same world.

1750
01:43:19,531 --> 01:43:22,500
It's all the world
I ever wanted.

1751
01:43:23,702 --> 01:43:26,170
And we nearly got away.

1752
01:43:26,272 --> 01:43:28,467
Remember
the night of the carnival?

1753
01:43:28,574 --> 01:43:30,735
Yes, I remember.

1754
01:43:30,843 --> 01:43:33,175
Oh, it's was a wonderful dream.

1755
01:43:35,014 --> 01:43:37,141
Now it's over.

1756
01:43:38,751 --> 01:43:40,719
Everything is different.

1757
01:43:40,819 --> 01:43:43,583
Nothing has really changed,

1758
01:43:43,689 --> 01:43:46,419
nothing except you and me.

1759
01:43:48,594 --> 01:43:50,892
You're a king now.

1760
01:43:50,996 --> 01:43:53,556
I still love you, Kathie.

1761
01:43:53,666 --> 01:43:55,600
I always will.

1762
01:43:56,802 --> 01:43:58,531
And you?

1763
01:43:59,672 --> 01:44:01,867
No matter what ever happens,

1764
01:44:02,808 --> 01:44:05,208
that will never change.

1765
01:44:08,547 --> 01:44:10,777
My only love.

1766
01:44:12,184 --> 01:44:14,414
Your first love.

1767
01:44:35,074 --> 01:44:37,133
Goodbye, Kathie.

1768
01:44:40,813 --> 01:44:42,781
Goodbye, your majesty.

1769
