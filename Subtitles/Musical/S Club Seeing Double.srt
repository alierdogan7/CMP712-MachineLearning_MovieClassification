We got the record company first
We're gonna pick up some gold discs

8
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,555
Then we've got radio-station
interviews for the album promotion

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,271
press conference, then a photo
session for tomorrow's front page

10
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,954
And then finally, we have the gig

12
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,798
Thank you, Barcelona
Good night

Thank you very much
We'll see you next year!

You were brilliant tonight Brilliant
You, you, you All of you

00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,868
Barcelona loves you
You are the real tortillas

16
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,473
You're right
We were pretty good

17
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,359
Water won't cut it now,
I'm gonna need plasma

18
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,512
Well done, guys
That was it, the last gig of our tour

19
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,269
So, Alistair, what are you
gonna do during our month off?

20
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,954
Because I'm going to the beach,
get a little tan

21
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,270
I'm gonna go back to London,
see my family

22
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,911
- go in the studio and chill out...
- Hold it Your what?

23
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,469
Our month off,
now that the tour's finished

24
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,713
A month, a week, a day
They all sound so similar, don't they?

25
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,838
- Alistair, you promised us
- You can't keep doing this to us

26
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,194
You promised us that month

27
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,354
Okay, okay Time off starts with a week
in LA, right after this press conference

28
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,589
- That's ridiculous
- What?

29
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,799
For the album It's a great album,
but you've got to promote it

30
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,878
Natalie, protein bars?

31
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,110
What are we gonna do?

32
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,433
- Why don't we fire him
- Who's gonna manage us, then?

33
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,155
Well, we could manage ourselves,
I suppose

34
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,993
And do loads of solo projects
that no one's gonna buy

35
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,390
And then you can marry
a footballer, Rach

36
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,516
And have loads of babies
with silly names

37
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,148
No, come on, guys
We've gotta stand up to him

38
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,912
Can't we do this in the morning?

39
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,551
No time Flight for Los Angeles leaves
at 7 am You can sleep on the plane

40
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,551
Come on Reporters are outside

41
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,995
Big smiles, energy,
eyes and teeth

42
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,873
Guys, look, I know it's tough, but
I promise you, it won't always be like this

43
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,748
One day, your records won't sell
The label will drop you

44
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,469
and even I won't return your calls

45
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,311
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,
S Club

46
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,316
S Club, do you feel that your exposure
to the West Coast hip-hop scene

47
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,357
will be felt musically
on your next album?

48
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,669
- Yes
- No

49
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,558
- What she said
- What she said

50
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,597
How many of you girls
have had implants?

51
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,595
Me I had a cactus once,
but I watered it too much and it died

52
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,550
Do you see yourselves
as a manufactured band?

53
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,631
Do you see yourself
as a war correspondent?

54
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,119
What do you miss most
about being on the road?

55
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,430
- My dog
- Sunday roast

56
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,955
Tea with the queen Yeah

57
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,189
Bradley

58
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,592
Sorry, sorry, sorry What did you say?
I missed the question Sorry

59
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,511
Well, that wasn't so bad, now, was it?

60
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,352
We're having fun, aren't we?

61
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,273
A lot of people would love
to be in your shoes

62
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,675
Not in Jo's Her feet stink

63
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,037
- You all right?
- You said we was gonna have a holiday

64
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,395
Give me that

65
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,319
Get some sleep Up in three hours

66
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,753
" Up in three hours"

67
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,514
Alistair Beresford?

68
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,674
- That's me Have we met?
- Susan Sealov<i>e Enchantée</i>

69
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,478
<i>Enchanté</i>

70
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,230
Bloody hell!

71
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,989
Right, that's it Nobody move
I've got a gun

72
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,751
Guys, why is it so dark in here?

73
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,358
What are you lot doing down there?

74
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,875
Am I dreaming?
What's this big, hard thing?

75
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,155
- Jon
- Get off!

76
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,118
- Oh, sorry
- What is going on?

77
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,429
Look at the time!
We've missed our flight!

78
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,795
Alistair's gonna kill us!

79
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,953
- He checked out?
- We have a dress code

80
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,636
- Okay, did he leave a message?
- No message No <i>pijamas</i> in the lobby

81
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,395
A forwarding address? Anything?

82
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,273
This

83
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,869
It's the bill

84
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,830
I don't understand this
It's really not like Alistair

85
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,949
Can you believe the bill
was 2000 Euros?

86
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,675
- Why didn't he wake us?
- We upset him He's paying us back

87
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,034
We gave him a hard time

88
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,589
We always give him a hard time
He knows it's in fun

89
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,390
Maybe it's his idea of a joke to leave us
here stranded with no money or tickets

90
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,835
Well, what's funny about that?

91
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,436
Oh, yeah, that is funny,
on some level

92
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,272
I mean, 10 years on from now
when we look back, I'll be saying:

93
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,116
"Jo, do you remember the time
when Alistair abandoned us

94
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,317
and we went down to the lobby
in our <i>pijamas</i>?"

95
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,109
It'll be hilarious Really funny

96
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,353
If this is a joke, then it's on him
because we just got what we wanted

97
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,593
A day off

98
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,354
Guys?

99
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,998
- Guess what I found
- Well done, you, Rach

100
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,317
- Yes!
- Come on

101
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,794
High-five

102
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,232
This has been one
of the best days of my life

103
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,790
- Paradise Heaven on earth
- I'm creamed and steamed

104
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,191
Go ahead, feel my skin
No charge

105
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,319
- lf only we had just one more day
- Well, we haven't heard from Alistair yet

106
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,789
I mean, why can't we just stay here
until we do?

107
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,639
Well, don't look at me

108
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,349
Bradley gave the room-service girl
a 60 percent tip

109
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,476
It's all right

110
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,870
I can stick it back together
with my nail glue

111
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,918
Hannah, it's at its limit
Come on, guys, cough up

112
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,152
All right, what have we got?
What have we got?

113
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,670
After all that, we've got 2 Euros left
I think we're in trouble

114
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,310
Well, we're gonna
have to go back on tour

115
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,469
Right, what we'll do is, exchange
our tickets and book a flight Okay?

116
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,517
So who's got the tickets to LA?

117
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,831
Oh, well, that's Natalie
Natalie takes care of the tickets

118
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,595
Okay, so who's got her number?

119
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,389
So we're stranded

120
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,476
- I'm starting to panic
- No, you're not

121
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,916
I can't quite breathe properly

122
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,200
I'm not getting oxygen to my brain
I tell you, I'm hallucinating

123
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,839
I can see us on TV

124
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,677
It's Happening Now <i>live from</i>
<i>Los Angeles, California S Club</i>

125
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,989
When did we tape this?

126
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,069
Hang on a minute,
does my bum really look that big?

127
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,358
Well it's not taped, it's live Look

128
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,195
But that's impossible Where it says,
" live," that can't mean it's live

129
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,476
It can't mean it's happening now

130
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,916
- Excuse me, what show is this?
- It's called <i>It's Happening Now</i>

131
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,071
S Club

132
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:47,349
- Jo, my favourite
- That is not Jo I'm Jo

133
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,832
Hey, guys Look, there's Alistair
Don't you see?

134
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,037
He's got fed up with us whining
and moaning all the time

135
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,954
so he hired look-alikes in LA
He's trying to teach us a lesson

136
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,079
Well, we're gonna teach him a lesson
because he's fired, and that is it

137
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,151
How could he do this to us?

138
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,118
Especially as I lent him
my fluffy monkey slippers

139
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,834
- That's it He's fired
- Can we fire him?

140
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,798
I mean, we signed a contract

141
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,951
Yeah, but has anyone
ever read the contract?

142
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,554
Apparently, Alistair can make us
weed his yard

143
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,473
If he needs a kidney transplant,
one of us has to be the donor

144
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,234
I said we should have got a proper
lawyer instead of your uncle Peter

145
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,914
He knows the legal system
better than any other lawyer

146
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,077
Your uncle's an ex- Con

147
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,110
Oh, come on, you lot This is serious

148
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,796
We've gotta find Alistair
before this thing gets out of hand

149
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,037
Come on, Jon, quick
Lower, lower, lower

150
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,589
Lower That's it
Come on, come on

151
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,435
That's it That's it
All right, all right, I got it

152
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,991
Ready

153
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,230
Hannah?

154
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,435
Well, I'm not taking a suitcase
I'll look far too suspicious

155
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,599
Let me handle this, yeah

156
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,671
Please, my <i>hombre,</i>
prepare our bill for checkout

157
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,753
- You pay the bill now?
- Yeah, just after we go for our short walk

158
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,115
- Walk?
- Cardiovascular

- Better go

00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,553
<i>Hello, can I help?</i>

162
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,229
- Yes! I think we handled that pretty well
- It was a piece of cake

163
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,119
S Club, you don't pay the bill

164
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,998
- First th<i>e pijamas,</i> now this

00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,231
With those?

167
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,312

00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,514
Yeah, do some squats
for me, please, Hannah

170
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,078
Arrest them

171
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,960
I'm really tired of this

172
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,797
I've had enough

173
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,997
We were gonna wire the money
to the hotel as soon as we got to America

174
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,596
- That's what Columbus said
- We haven't done anything wrong

175
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,479
- Been there, heard it
- Yeah, but we can explain

176
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,628
- Older than the oldest profession
- You're making a big mistake

177
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,559
Tell me something new

178
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,790
You can't arrest us
We're a famous band

179
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,032
If you let us go, I'll sign an autograph
and give you a copy of our new CD

180
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,510
That's what I was waiting to hear
You're the S Club? All of you?

181
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:55,390
- Yes
- Impersonating the S Club Fraud

182
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,279
- Impersonating?
- Anything else?

183
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,558
- We're not impersonators
- I've got the complaint right here

184
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,872
Signed by their manager,
Mr Beresford

185
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,673
Alistair?

186
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,474
Alistair? Alistair?

187
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,596
Open your eyes

188
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,914
- Alistair?
- You hit him too hard, Miss Sealove

189
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,631
Nonsense, doctor
Look, he's awake

190
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,554
Mr Beresford?

191
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,869
Don't try to move

192
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,670
There's someone
I'd like you to meet

193
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,440
Hello, handsome

194
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,591
Can I have a club sandwich
with no pickle?

195
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,479
I don't believe this
I can't get any reception in here

196
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,949
Hey! We know our rights

197
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,554
<i>Attention Anyone caught sucking feet</i>
<i>will get two days in solitary</i>

198
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,157
- Oh, my God, it's the Spanish Inquisition
- Blood I'm gonna faint

199
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,192
No, no, my dear, it's not blood

200
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,955
They've been crushing grapes
in the warden's vineyard

201
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,430
If you give me 2 Euros,
I'll let you lick Armando's feet

202
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,192
He's got the biggest

203
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,194
My little Chianti, aren't you, Armando?
Private reserve

204
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,832
I'll give you 2 Euros,

205
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,231
Escape? My dear

206
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,157
this is the only prison in Barcelona
where people are trying to break in

207
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,838
But I can tell you,
the desk sergeant does like to dance

208
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,959

<i>Don't stop moving</i>
<i>To that S Club beat</i>

259
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,518
- I feel like an escaped convict
- Let's go to Natalie's

260
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,270
Okay, try around the other side

261
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,476
Guys, what took you so long?
The prison is right there

262
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,832
The scenic route was better

263
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,392
Guys, guys, guys
Natalie, please help us, all right?

264
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,232
We're fugitives
We don't know what to do

265
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,868
But you can't be here
You're in California

266
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,112
Look, you're booked to play
at the Fuller Center

267
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,236
Guys, we've got to get to LA

268
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,236
Tickets, passports

269
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,551
gum, earplugs, protein bars

270
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,912
neck rest, Game Boy and vibrating...

271
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,995
No, no! My last dollars and the address
of the place I rent when I'm in LA

272
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,069
- Bye Good luck Bye Bye, guys
- Bye

273
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,793
England!

274
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,756
England!

275
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,192
England!

276
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,271
Bradley, stop it!

277
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,079
Wait for me Come back!

278
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,676
Well, according to Natalie,
112 Whalecove View

279
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,358
is an attractive, sea- View property
with an alfresco dining area

280
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,348
This must be the place

281
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,030
Well, she said the keys
were under the flowerpot

282
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,351
Oh, great

283
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,998
Tina, you start on that side

284
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,596
I found it

285
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,276
We should go there
and kick those look-alikes right off-stage

286
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,919
What? And get arrested again?

287
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,957
According to Alistair,
we are the impostors

288
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,312
Maybe he's right
You know in that movie where

289
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,553
the robots are programmed to think
that they're people, but they weren't?

290
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,871
Well, maybe we're not actually us

291
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:54,113
Maybe they're us and we're them,
and we actually don't realise it

292
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,791
- You lost me at " hello"
- Okay, we'll just stick to the plan

293
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,752
Yes

294
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,710
We're gonna go in there, find Alistair

295
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,791
We're gonna have
a civilised conversation

296
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,912
And then we fire his butt,
and we kick it down the stairs

297
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,674
- Yeah
- Let's go

298
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,118
You lot stay here,
and we'll meet you after the show

299
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,352
- How much for the tickets?
- A hundred bucks from a scalper

300
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,671
- Each?
- I knew them when they were nobodies

301
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,472
Thank you

302
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,069
Thanks

303
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,638
- Screw you!
- Tina, wait Come back!

304
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,075
Can you give me
my microphone back, please?!

305
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,800
- Don't do that!
- Oy, give me my microphone!

306
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,713
It's my microphone!

307
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,036
Thank you

308
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,635
I'm sorry, but that girl was awful,
and everyone's gonna think she's me

309
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,752
That was no reason to jump on-stage,
grab her microphone and scream:

310
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,718
" Hello, Hollywood, it's great to be back"

311
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,830
It was like looking into a mirror

312
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,512
Maybe I had a twin, and we were
separated at birth

313
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,229
- I've actually always wanted a twin
- Yeah, or maybe they were robots

314
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,234
Or popbots

315
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,959
- Let's just stick with the twin thing
- Yeah

316
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,752
Let's go through this one more time

317
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,158
We find Alistair, and we have
a civilised conversation

318
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,189
- Wow, they really are identical
- No way, she's at least a size 14

319
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,997
I can't believe they walked
through without giving one autograph

320
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,436
Our fans are really gonna hate us now

321
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,428
- Bradley, I love you! No, wait! Bradley!
- Look, there's Alistair

322
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,592
Not now We're never gonna get
past those security guards

323
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,473
Come on, guys Let's just
follow the bus, all right?

324
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,315
- They're staying in a privat<i>e e</i>state
- Something's fishy

325
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,313
Yeah, that must have been
when we got thrown in that garbage

326
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,478
What I mean is, we never stay anywhere
this posh on tour

327
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,596
Well, why don't we just have a look

328
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,519
We could probably jump over
that wall or something

329
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,190
Who let the dogs out?

330
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,230
No, for real Look

331
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,037
I've got an idea

332
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,793

This is Tough Sirloin
Meet me at the wall

356
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,869
Now, settle down Be quiet

357
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,515
I've got two friends I'd like you to meet

358
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,912
This is Mr Walker He's a naughty dog

359
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,274
And this is Rafferty He's a nice dog

360
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,353
Now, one day, Mr Walker
decided he wanted to go to the beach

361
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:05,436
So he got on his little spotty trunks,
and off he went Bye- Bye

362
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,559
Right, who's gonna go first, then?
Rach, you go

363
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,039
If I don't make it, will you tell my mum
I wanna be buried in my violet dress

364
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,796
Not the one I wore for my sweet 16,
but the one with the sandals

365
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,115
Now, Rachel

366
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,070
Okay, I can do this

367
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,510
Mr Walker's swimming trunks
were too small

368
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,430
because Mr Walker
had a big, fat tummy

369
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,237
- We can't make our way through that
- It's the only way of getting past the dogs

370
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,109
Stop, stop

371
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,755
Okay, Tina, come here

372
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,829
Okay, go, go, go!

373
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,715
Don't pay any attention to that

374
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,512
Do you wanna listen to my story or not?

375
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,559

- Do we have to stand in this bush?
- Yes

410
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,595
- Why?
- Because I'm allergic to it

411
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,838
Don't worry about that
That's just the atchoo bird

412

00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,831
- They're right behind us!
- Follow me

422
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,638
Faster!

423
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,318
Quick, keep moving

424

00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,433
Puppy? Puppy, my...

431
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,190
- Oh, nice buns, Brad
- I'm just glad they're still there

432
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,630
Where's Jo?

433
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,709
Hang on a minute
Has anyone seen my sweater?

434
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,592
No?

435
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,039
- Maybe we should have rung the doorbell
- Then I could have finished my story

436
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,998
Now I'll never know
what happened in th<i>e e</i>nd

437
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,952
I don't understand Alistair
Why is he doing this to us?

438
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,918
Well, we asked for time off
I guess we got it

439
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:35,113
Wait, he's replaced us with them,
so why don't we replace them with us

440
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,032
How?

441
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,035
We'll kidnap three of them
and switch places

442
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,949
Good luck, Rach
Operation Squeegee is a go

- Wait just a minute
- Oh, no I've had orders

447
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,149
Security guards cannot have
dirty windows It restricts your vision

448
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,595
Could you shut the windows
so I can clean them?

449
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,395

- Okay, wait there

459
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,318
Hi, Teen
I've got a nice bucket

460
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,116
I've always wanted to do that

461
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,876
Never mind that Just start stripping

462
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,392
What?

463
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,278
Hannah, there you are

00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,351
How nice of you to join us

465
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,274
Perhaps we could rehearse verse two
while we're still in our 20s

466
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,668
Good Playback

467
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:29,675
<i>Lately you've been searching</i>
<i>For the other side, side</i>

468
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:33,628
<i>There's a feeling to discover, baby</i>

469
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,839
<i>You can feel it in the air tonight</i>

470
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,873
<i>Let the groove just tak e you forward</i>

471
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,279
- Grab him
- Hey, hey!

472
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,040
<i>Let's mak e it tonight</i>
<i>Don't fak e it</i>

473
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,988
<i>There's no need to analyse</i>
<i>Now's the time to recognise</i>

474
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,038
- Are you ready?
- Yeah

475
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,838
Now, find out what you can

476
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,834
Meet us tomorrow
on Mulholland Outlook about, say, 1300

477
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,157
- Got it
- All right, I'll look after you I mean, him

478
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,320
- Okay
- Go Go, go, go, go

479
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,677
<i>Everybody</i>
<i>Dance</i>

480
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:16,719
<i>Let the music tak e you over</i>
<i>Dance</i>

And cut
Excellent work, everybody

484
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,757
I'll see you on set in five minutes
Final touches Thank you

485
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,879
Are you hungry?

486
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,519
I've got some toast and jam

487
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,797
If you give them toast and jam,
they'll want milk to wash it down

488
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,916
then they'll be asking
to use the loo

489
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:46,749
So we'll have no toast and no jam
We'll just talk

490
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,673
- So, what's your name?
- Rachel

491
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,400
What's your real name? Don't lie to me!

492
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,678
I'm Rachel

493
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:00,039
- Is this part of our training programme?
- Look, I'm asking the questions, all right?

494
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,513
What training programme?

495
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,431
This is a test

496
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,757
It's a good test

497
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,708
Do I tie you up now, Bradley?

498
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,993
We'll talk about it later

499
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,511
Come here, you guys

500
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,715
Either she's jerking my chain,
or they're all two slices short of a loaf

501
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,032
We might as well untie them
They're too dumb to escape

502
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,993
So, what's after dinner?

503
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,149
- Rehearse, of course
- What, every night?

504
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:58,795
- Performing is what we do
- Don't you ever just relax and hang?

505
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,194
Relax?

506
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,355
- Hang?
- No, no, no

507
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,590
I think what Hannah means is,
you know

508
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,190
we could just sit here
and talk and stuff

509
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,197
Exchange life stories and

510
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,234
we could discuss how we,
and by "we," I mean you

511
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,675
how you got here

512
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,310
and wher<i>e "</i>we," again that's you,
where we come from

513
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,950
And what "w<i>e"</i> hope to achieve

514
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,630
We are S Club We formed a band

515
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,438
We make records

516
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,795
We release records, and we tour

517
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,309
Great hang!

518
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,316
What do we do now?

519
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,791
Are you gonna eat that?

520
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,159
No

521
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,958
I've made tea

522
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,708
- Oh, thanks
- Enjoy

523
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,515
Did she just get you tea?

524
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,793
What? Biscuits as well

525
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,793
Tina, Tina

526
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,152
We gotta keep her
She's housebroken

527
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,912
You're a sick boy

528
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,593
What's all this?

529
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,718
SBB: Shower before bed

530
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,070
Shower before breakfast

531
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,308
SBB You must shower

532
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,156
No, no, no It's all right, honestly
I had one this morning

533
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,436
Just a " BB" Before breakfast

534
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,871
Fresh as a daisy, me

535
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:19,436
But go right ahead
You knock yourself out

536
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,114
Jon, I think the natives
are getting a bit suspicious

537
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,158
I don't care, Rach
These don't come off for anyone

538
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,231
unless they've bought me dinner first

539
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,436
For heaven's sake! Come on

540
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,511
Pretend you're in a JLo video

541
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,512
We're adults, aren't we?

542
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,989
We can handle this in a mature way

543
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,992
No time to be a shy guy, Jon

544
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,439
SBB Shower

545

<i>Just a shower of little droplets</i>
<i>Falling from the sky</i>

546
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,510
Bradley, don't use all the hot water
The rest of us want a shower too

547
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,592
<i>Scrub, scrub, scrub</i>

- Shower time
- Hang on a minute

552
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:31,869
You can't...

553
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,957
You can't do that

554
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,479
Wait, what are you doing?

555
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,910
Well, it's a small shower,
but we can all fit

556
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,156
Oh, right Well, then, you wash my back

557
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,231
and then, Rachel, I'll wash your back

558
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,439
and after that, we can turn around
and do the same again

559
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:50,959
Great

560
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,388
Now pass me the loofa

561
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,313
What are you doing? Get out
What are you doing in here?

562
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,999
That's sick, man!

Where's Jon?

566
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,113
We are required to shower together
to save on water

567
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,429
Well, who made that rule?

568
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,511
Alistair makes all the rules

569
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,154
Any breach of protocol
must be reported to Alistair

570
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:23,198
- Jon didn't breach any protocol
- Where is he, then?

571
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,638
He's right behind you

572
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,358
- Jon
- Hello, love

573
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,635
Watch out for that shirt

574
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,832
Yeah, it might get all wrinkly
in the shower

575
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:40,836
Jon, is it just me, or did you notice
something in the showers?

576
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,437
No, I did I'll admit it, Rach,
I looked

577
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,153
but hey, I still respect you

578
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,153
Jon, shut up, I'm being serious!
I'm talking about them!

579
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,117
They haven't got any bellybuttons

580
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,236
Jon, she's right

581
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,789

582
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,836
Today was a good day

583
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,072
Keep this up and we shall
be ahead of schedule

584
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:10,790
Tomorrow, we have six hours
of rehearsals

585
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,792
- seven hours of interviews
- Thank you, Alistair

586
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,520

This thing, it's like a crash course
on how to be us

604
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,350
They're not look-alikes,
they're replacements

605
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:19,315
Guys, we have to get out of here
We've gotta warn the others

606
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,832
Look at them They're really quite sweet

607
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,398
Maybe we should take them clubbing
I bet they've never been

608
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,790
Maybe they're robots

609
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,356
Or popbots

610
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,438
Well, personally, I think they're clones

611
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,511
It's not science fiction anymore, is it?

612
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,319
They've cloned sheep and goats
before, so why not a band?

613
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,832
You can't just clone someone
unless you've got a piece of them

614
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,670
like hair or fingernails or skin cells

615
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,034
The Internet!

616
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,629
Okay, here it is

617
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,870
One guy's been buying
all the S Club stuff

618
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,389
Victor Gaghan He bids on everything

619
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,471

620
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,200
They've got our underwear

621
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,637
Well, do a search on him

00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,593
Look at them They're just so content

651
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,360
That's because they're bores
and boomerangs are boring

652
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,192
It's a perfect match

653
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:48,199
If I'd have known you could
make that from my underwear

654
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,839
I would never have worn any

655
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,150
But they're not bores, are they?

656
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,029
They just don't want anything

657
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,997
They don't have to worry
about anything

658
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,348

Hedge Pig and the Shopper?

679
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,195
Call me back

680
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,957
Something's happening
This is not right Something's wrong

681
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:29,630
Maybe Jon thought I said, " Malibu
Overlook," not " Mulholland Outlook"

682
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:33,433
- I'm gonna check the beach
- Oh, I've never been to the ocean

683
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,194
All right, well, come with me

684
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:59,114
<i>Everybody's got something</i>
<i>They had to leave behind</i>

685
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:06,475
<i>One regret from yesterday</i>
<i>That just seems to grow with time</i>

686
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:10,355
<i>There's no use looking back</i>
<i>Or wondering</i>

687
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:14,069
<i>How it could be now</i>
<i>Or might have been</i>

688
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,196
<i>All this I know</i>

689
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:21,036
<i>But still I can't find ways to let you go</i>

690
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,954
<i>I never had a dream come true</i>

691
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:28,749
<i>Till the day that I found you</i>

692
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:33,118
<i>Even though I pretend that I've moved on</i>

693
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,158
<i>You'll always be my baby</i>

694
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:39,949
<i>I never found the words to say</i>

695
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:43,749
<i>You're the one I think about each day</i>

696
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:48,198
<i>And I know no matter where</i>
<i>Life tak es me to</i>

697
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:52,478
<i>A part of me will always be</i>

698
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:56,315
<i>With you, yeah</i>

699
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,073
<i>Somewhere in my memory</i>

700
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,955
<i>I've lost all sense of time</i>

701
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:14,189
<i>And tomorrow can never be</i>
<i>Because yesterday is all that fills my mind</i>

702
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,915
<i>There's no use looking back</i>
<i>Or wondering</i>

703
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:21,675
<i>How it should be now</i>
<i>Or might have been</i>

704
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,512
<i>All this I know</i>

705
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:30,074
<i>But still I can't find ways to let you go</i>

706
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:34,151
<i>I never had a dream come true</i>

707
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:38,035
<i>Till the day that I found you</i>

708
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,398
<i>Even though I pretend</i>
<i>that I've moved on</i>

709
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:45,353
<i>You'll always be my baby</i>

710
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:49,109
<i>I never found the words to say</i>

711
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:52,995
<i>You're the one I think about each day</i>

712
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:57,312
<i>And I know no matter where</i>
<i>Life tak es me to</i>

713
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:01,069
<i>A part of me will always be</i>

714
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:05,477
<i>You'll always be the dream</i>
<i>That fills my head</i>

715
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:09,639
<i>Yes you will, say you will</i>
<i>You know you will, oh, baby</i>

716
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:15,995
<i>You'll always be the one</i>
<i>I know I'll never forget</i>

717
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:19,749
<i>There's no use looking back</i>
<i>Or wondering</i>

718
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:23,396
<i>Because love is a strange</i>
<i>And funny thing</i>

719
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:27,030
<i>No matter how I try and try</i>

720
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:31,716
<i>I just can't say goodbye</i>

721
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:33,998
<i>No, no, no, no</i>

722
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,835
<i>I never had a dream come true</i>

723
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,709
<i>Till the day that I found you</i>

724
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:46,271
<i>Even though I pretend that I've moved on</i>

725
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,591
<i>You'll always be my baby</i>

726
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,917
<i>I never found the words to say</i>

727
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:56,709
<i>You're the one I think about each day</i>

728
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:01,112
<i>And I know no matter where</i>
<i>Life tak es me to</i>

729
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,875
<i>A part of me will always be</i>

730
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:09,238
<i>A part of me will always be</i>

731
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:13,873
<i>With you</i>

732
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,239
- What are we gonna do?
- Well, they're not coming

733
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:23,238
Why don't we go and meet Bradley
They must know something

734
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,630
They think they're S Club
What could they know?

735
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:29,355
Well, supposing we told them the truth?
The shock might jog their memory

736
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:31,988
Truth?

737
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,997
Truth about what?

738
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:39,430
The truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the...

739
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,953
I can't do this

740
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,519
Oh, for God's sake

741
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,955
Oy, you lot You're not real
You've been made- Up

742
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,958
- You're clones Get over it All right?
- What?

743
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,675
You mean we're fake?

744
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:11,070
You've been grown
Manufactured in a lab

745
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,874
- Like penicillin
- Or cheerleaders

746
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,913
- Fake boobs
- Yeah, I just said, cheerleaders

747
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:20,673
We're the real S Club

748
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:24,157
You've been brainwashed
with a personal history

749
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:27,118
- That would explain the gaps
- Gaps?

750
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:30,869
Well, yeah Whenever I pass
a shoe store, I get really excited

751
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,871
- But I don't know why
- Oh, for pity's sake

752
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,036
- Where's Victor Gaghan?
- Who?

753
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,430
We have to find him
if we wanna save our friends

754
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,996
So either you tell us where they are
or goodbye to your heads

755
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:45,877
Look, just try and remember
Where did you first meet?

756
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:49,868
- I met Jon at an audition
- That's what you was programmed to say

757
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,395
Come on, think about it Think

758
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,519
Jon

759
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,991
do you remember the lights?

760
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,951
We were in a cave

761
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,348
A big, colourful cave

762
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,871
And we were all there

763
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,109
- Papa
- Where are you?

764
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,518
I can't remember

765
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,312
Peak

766
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:45,196
It was called " Eagle Peak"

767
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:14,359
Get off me! Let me go!

768
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:20,549
This, my little pop chums,
is th<i>e e</i>nd of the line

769
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,674
This isn't just Alistair's way
of getting back at us

770
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,159
This is bigger than that

771
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:38,269
Okay, so we've been captured by a man
who's built a dungeon in his basement

772
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,955
Now, that's not good

773
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,639
Sit down

774
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,555
All right

775
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:55,399
Now, let's not have any trouble here

776
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:57,391
- Give me your hand
- Who are you?

777
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,036
Oh, no, please don't cut my fingers off
I need those...

778
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,278
Oh, right, a fingernail

779
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,630
Oh, okay, you can have one of those

780
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,872
Actually, could you cut that one?

781
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:16,072
Because that one's really snagging
on my jumpers

782
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,715
- I'll give you a tip
- Not necessary

783
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,270
But I have a tip for you,
Miss Smarty Pants

784
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,633
Say your prayers

785
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:33,069
What did that mean?

786
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,352
Don't you see? Gaghan's gonna
clone us again from our fingernails

787
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:39,632
Yeah, he's got what he wants now
He doesn't need us here anymore

788
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:47,993
He's gonna kill us!

789
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,390
We can't just go on our own
We need backup

790
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,198
Okay, go and call the LAPD

791
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:57,079
Tell them an evil scientist cloned us
and had them do gigs

792
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,589
I'll come and visit you in the loony bin

793
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:09,038
Eagle Peak Let's rock 'n' roll, baby

794
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:10,869
We'll come with you

795
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,518
- We can't trust you
- Yes, you can

796
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:19,514
Alistair lied to us We're feeling really

797
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,032
- Angry
- Yes!

798
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,191
- We want
- Revenge

799
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,879
Yes!

800
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,595
- I'm sorry, it's too dangerous
- We're not afraid

801
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:35,995
To sum up, we're angry, we want revenge,
we're not afraid and can kill if necessary

802
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,115
Wait

803
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:46,873
- We're still on the same team, right?
- Yeah

804
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,438
All right Let's go

805
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,189
All right

806
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:20,749
First, we'll short-circuit
th<i>e e</i>lectrical current

807
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,353
then bypass the video input

808
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:26,308
Then freeze the computer- Identification
system, and if that don't work

809
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,675
then we'll just chuck Hannah
over the gate

810
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:37,033
- It's a retinal scanner
- Rectal scanner?

811
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,236
Well, every castle has one
of those, don't they?

812
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:42,437
No, Hannah, a retinal scanner

813
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:13,831
Look, this is gonna take forever
Why don't we split up into two groups

814
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,991
You go and find Jo,
Bradley and Tina

815
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,674
and we'll try and find Rachel,
Hannah and Jon

816
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:21,479
We're here
You found us

817
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:25,997
And we found you
That was so easy

818
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:29,877
Jo, this is your idea

819
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:53,911
- No! It was Bradley
- My back

820
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,470
You guys okay?

821
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:02,870
Wait a minute
Where's Bradley?

822
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,758
He's there

823
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:09,198
- What happened?
- You got hit by a pillow Come on

824
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:21,873
Nice try

825
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,752
but we can't let you escape

826
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,751
Grab them

827
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,032
There you are

828
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:50,557
Admiring my collection of genetic matter
from the dearly departed?

829
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:55,117
- But Tom Green isn't dead
- A man can dream, can't he?

830
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:59,636
So you're the guy who bought
the knickers off the Internet?

831
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:05,148
Yes I wanted to meet you all in person
before I tied up the loos<i>e e</i>nds

832
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,194
You must be wondering
why I brought you here

833
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,471
I used to have heroes

834
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,639
stars who I'd write to

835
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:18,590
but who never replied,
because I didn't count

836
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:22,873
I was beneath them

837
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:28,310
Then I realised
I can grow my own stars

838
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,270
Programme them to obey me,
do whatever I say

839
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:36,951
- So I started collecting their DNA
- But it doesn't make any sense, though

840
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:40,396
If you want power, then why not clone
people like Bill Gates or President Bush?

841
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:43,433
You can take over the world
with clones of that calibre

842
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,358
Tell me

843
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:50,878
who would you rather see stepping
naked out of an accelerated growth pod

844
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,640
Bill Gates or Britney Spears?

845
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,671
- Britney
- Britney Definitely

846
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:57,712
Thank you

847
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:00,917
As for controlling the world,
do you really think

848
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:06,154
people are interested
in politicians or corporate moguls?

849
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:09,238
The subtle influence
that captures the minds

850
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:14,235
and hearts
of the young is music

851
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:17,517
The future lies

852
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,717
in music

853
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:23,919
And I own that future

854
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:28,232
Of course, I'm only telling you this
because you'll be dead in five minutes

855
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:32,117
- Do you wanna know how?
- I'd actually rather be surprised

856
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,118
The floor will fall away,
dumping you into a pit

857
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:40,189
full of lethally poisonous
snakes and spiders

858
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,789
You don't scare us

859
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:45,435
What are you talking about?
Yes, it does

860
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,319
Actually it's more the
spiders than the snakes

861
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,630
No, no, no
It's definitely the snakes

862
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:53,635
Shut up

863
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:59,708
There is nothing more powerful than
an idea whose time has come

864
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:02,599
Your time, however, is gone

865
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,992
Goodbye, S Club

866
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,716
Look, I don't understand
We're S Club

867
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:17,829
No, we're fake boobs
The real S Club are in there

868
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,475
This looks familiar

869
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,359
It's just like I remember it

870
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:42,997
It's no use struggling

871
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:45,469
The doctor is a genius

872
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:51,510
He's calculated all the odds, run all the
scenarios, envisioned every outcome

873
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:55,593
There's absolutely nothing
that can save you now

874
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,118
Stop that!

875
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,834
- There you are
- Stop that right now Obey me!

876
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:09,316
- We're rebelling If that's all right
- It's not all right

877
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,750
Get back to the castle!
It's rehearsal time

878
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:13,757
- No way
- That's my girl

879
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:18,710
- You lied to us, Alistair
- Yeah, we're just fakes Copies Clones

880
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:21,958
Is that what they told you?

881
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:24,680
Don't you see?
They're jealous

882
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:26,558
They want to replace you

883
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:29,553
- You mustn't trust them
- Don't listen to him

884
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,197
You must trust me
I wouldn't lie to you

885
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,272
- Maybe he's right
- No, he isn't

886
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,431
Come on, follow me

887
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:39,232
Wait

888
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,433
Alistair!

889
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,670
He's a clone

890
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,877
What? Wow

891
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,474
Look at that, a built-in M&M holder

892
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:57,558
By the way,
can I have my clothes back now?

893
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:05,073
<i>For lunch today there is meat loaf,</i>
<i>broccoli spears, followed by</i>

894
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,549
<i>humble pie, limp biscuit</i>
<i>and vanilla fudge</i>

895
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:10,029
<i>Vanilla ice cream</i>
<i>and cream for dessert</i>

896
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:13,112
<i>Lights out at 10:30 tonight, apart</i>
<i>from Marilyn Manson</i>

897
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,589
<i>who wants</i>
<i>to sleep with the lights on</i>

898
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,149
<i>The bedtime story</i>
<i>will be read by P Diddy</i>

899
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,038
<i>It will be</i> Little Red Riding
in the Hood

900
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:22,998
Tina There's hundreds of them

901
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:30,754
<i>Would Madonna please report to the</i>
<i>music room for extra singing lessons?</i>

902
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:38,194
Holy cloned cow

903
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:42,157
Is that Posh Spice over there
eating a steak and kidney pie?

904
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:44,476
Well, that proves
she's not the real thing

905
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:48,519
And look, there's Robbie Williams
having a food fight with Eminem

906
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:52,150
And Ozzy Osbourne I can't believe
they cloned Ozzy Osbourne

907
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:55,040
No
That's the real Ozzy Osbourne

908
01:14:55,240 --> 01:15:00,030
Victor never cloned him
He's a mad scientist, but he's not insane

909
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:02,556
All you, look

910
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:05,593
We've got something to show you

911
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:19,349
Spit it out, boy
What about the clones?

912
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:22,398
<i>They're rebelling, Dr Gaghan</i>

913
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,269
Damn!

914
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:29,438
- Lf we leave here, how will we survive?
- Form tribute bands

915
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,239
- You can go on <i>Pop Idol</i>
- The point is

916
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:36,035
there's a whole life out there
beyond those gates A whole world

917
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:38,998
A whole world where you can do
what you want, not what you're told

918
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,675
A whole world of fun and freedom

919
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:44,997
You can throw a plastic boomerang
whenever you want

920
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:49,239
And there's potatoes cooked
in hot grease and sugar Good, right?

921
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:52,756
Look, all you need
to say is, " I'm tired..."

922
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:56,071
Not so fast

923
01:15:56,840 --> 01:16:00,116
So go back to your rooms

924
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:04,794
Anyone who disobeys me will be killed

925
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:13,117
We'll have to make an example
of someone, I suppose

926
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,038
Get that one

927
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:20,878
No, get off me

928
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:26,114
If you kill her,
you have to kill me first

929
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:28,316
- And me
- And me

930
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:29,914
- And me
- And me

931
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,673
- And me
- And me

932
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,199
- And me
- And me

933
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:36,949
- We may need extra backup
- It's over

934
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:38,678
Plan Q

935
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:42,389
Isn't that " nuke Fort Knox
and ruin the world's economy"?

936
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:45,757
No
Plan Q:

937
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,480
Destroy th<i>e e</i>vidence

938
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:52,315
Blow this entire building to oblivion

939
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,030
Pull the switch

940
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,752
<i>Three minutes to destruction</i>

941
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,678
<i>All clones remain calm</i>

942
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,789
In three minutes, all of you

943
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,551
will be destroyed
along with this facility!

944
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,155
<i>- Two minutes, 52 to destruction</i>
- What are we gonna do?

945
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:23,158
Don't panic, all right
I've seen this bit a zillion times

946
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:25,675
The hero always saves the day

947
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:29,595
- Okay, so where are the heroes?
- We're the heroes, you mook

948
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:31,234
We've got three minutes

949
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,715
Hold up
Time- Out, time- Out

950
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:38,357
Why do we always get three minutes?
Why can't we get an hour? Why?

951
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:42,113
<i>We've been living a lie</i>

952
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:46,069
<i>We're not what we seem to be</i>

953
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:49,238
<i>And we've had enough of being fooled</i>

954
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:51,516
<i>And now we wanna be free</i>

955
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:54,592
<i>Yeah, we've been living a dream</i>

956
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,028
<i>Somebody else's</i>

957
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:58,708
<i>And now we wanna live ours</i>

958
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,354
<i>But we got to leave this game behind</i>

959
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,754
<i>To know who we really are</i>

960
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:10,316
<i>Don't let anyone tak e over your life</i>
<i>No, no, no</i>

<i>Don't give up your dreams</i>
<i>And you'll be all right, no, no</i>

962

<i>But they should have told you</i>

963
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:20,557
<i>When you're a clone</i>
<i>You know you're never alone</i>

964

01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,117

We've freed the clones

01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,908
We've just released
a whole new set of Britneys

*NSYNCs and Nelly Furtados
into the world

01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:47,314
Nobody move!

1020
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:52,110
I want my S clones back
They obeyed my every command

1021
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:56,717
They were always on time, and they
only needed one toilet break a week

1022
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:59,878
They were the perfect band

1023
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:05,269
Alistair!

1024
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:10,750
Okay, put me down, S Club
I'm sorry!

1025
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:15,717
- Natalie
- Hey, welcome to Hollywood

1026
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:18,599
You are not gonna believe
what's been going on

1027
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,114
Bye

1028
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:41,038
Bye, Rach

1029
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:42,838
Come here

1030
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:58,795
I'm gonna miss you, you know

1031
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:01,758
I've never met anyone
like you before

1032
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:04,593
Well, not anyone with a bellybutton

1033
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:07,593
Where are you gonna go?
What are you gonna do?

1034
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,591
I'll get along

1035
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:21,993
What the...?

1036
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:23,991
Bradley, that is disgusting

1037
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:30,989
- What are you doing? She's me
- No, it's not

1038
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:32,991
She's all right
I mean, she made me tea

1039
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:35,355
It doesn't mean I fancy you
I don't fancy you at all

1040
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:37,755
- That goes for me too
- Come on, you lots, stop bickering

1041
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:40,395
We'd better get going
We've got a big tour ahead of us

1042
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:42,631
- Natalie
- All right

1043
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,917
Now, we've got radio interviews
at 8 sharp tomorrow

1044
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:48,475
- Tuesday, San Diego Wednesday, Detroit
- Oh, no

1045
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,996
Thursday, New York
Friday, Washington

1046
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:52,149
Saturday, Kansas City

1047
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:55,269
- Wait!
- Wait!

1048
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,635
- Hey!
- Wait!

1049
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:01,509
- Come back! We need you!
- We need to talk!

1050
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:18,995
They're doing fine You know, they're
almost as good as the real thing!

1051
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,953
Cool
All right, take care

1052
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,709
Guys, Alistair says the S Club
are doing better than ever

1053
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:29,108
I think he's right as well

1054
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:32,757
I mean, Jon, for me,
really is the star of the show

1055
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:36,190
- I feel a bit guilty about this
- Well, don't

1056
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:39,233
They'll get time off when we go on
It's so perfectly fair

1057
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:41,231
Well, I think everyone
should have a clone

1058
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:43,038
People would just be
so much better off

1059
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:46,557
I just meant that they're
getting paid in boomerangs

1060
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:49,996
You've got to admit, the clones are
all right, though, aren't they?

1061
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:54,428
Aren't they, Rach?
They're all right

1062
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:59,112
- You know that already, right?
- Go on, Rachel

1063
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,478
This is ridiculous

1064
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,392
I want you to mean it,
"This is ridiculous"

1065
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,516
This is ridiculous

1066
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:28,511
Bradley

1067
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,509
- We can't trust you
- Yes, you can

1068
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:37,589
Alistair lied to us
We're feeling really

1069
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:42,756
- And we're feeling...
- Cut

1070
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:44,952

- Sorry

01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:09,239
Well, my name's actually Jonathan,
but everyone calls me Jon

1078
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,152
That's just J-O-N, no H

1079
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:14,872
One more time, Jon

1080
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:18,550
Guys, Alistair says the S Club
are doing better than ever

1081
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,870
I think he's right

1082
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:25,033
Sorry, I can't remember the line if I don't
do "you know, you know, you know"

1083
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:31,590
- I've got to get out of jail!
- Action

And cut

1086
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:41,150
Look, this is gonna take forever
Why don't we split into two groups

1087
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:43,231
You three...

1088
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:50,591
Look, this is gonna take forever
Why don't we split up into...

1089

One more time

We can't just go up there on our own
We need backup

1095
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:16,957
Go and phone the LAPD
Tell them that a mad scientist has...

1096
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:21,238
I want my life back!

I don't like that

1100
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:42,028
Where's Jon? We are required
to shower together to save on water

1101
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:46,830
- Well, who made that rule?
