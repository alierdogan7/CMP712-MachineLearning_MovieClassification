1
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,386
Dmn it!

2
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:46,114
One, two, three cars...
Absolutely useless.

3
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:09,042
What's wrong?
What happene driver

4
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:10,516
Why stop?

5
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:16,088
Sir a Vagrant is lying
unconscious on the ground

6
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:21,093
He must be a miserable
fellow with no money

7
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:24,155
Driver, put him in the car

8
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:29,164
You know it's my duty to
serve humanity.

9
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:53,450
He is unconscious. It looks
as if he hasn't eaten a thing.

10
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,724
He maybe love sick

11
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,659
He looks like a...

12
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,327
Driver fast to the hospital.

13
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:08,005
O God! save my soul

14
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:10,870
Doctors want only to operate

15
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:15,881
So you were faking it,
pretending, eh?

16
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:21,212
I was completely worn out.
I didn't have train fare

17
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:23,312
Driver, stop the car!

18
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,883
Blasphemy! Fake!

19
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:28,894
Get out of the car!

20
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,898
As you please.
You were kind a minute ago

21
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,438
Does he suffer from fits?

22
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:43,572
How dare you! Do you know
who you' re talking to?

23
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,410
Seth Dharmanand

24
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,372
I don't have any sympathy
for your sort.

25
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:54,976
If you want to reform, swear
that you won't lie or cheat

26
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,255
And you' ll speak only
the truth

27
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:58,922
On the contrary

28
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,726
If you lie, you drive
in a huge car

29
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,191
Soft hands apply eau-de-cologne

30
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:07,660
Speaking the truth you suffer

31
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:11,528
Driver, let's go.
HE looks like a crook

32
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:14,602
Seth Sonachand, if l' m
a crook, a 420....

33
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,332
You' re....

34
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,691
Bombay 420.

35
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,566
Let's go, old pal

36
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:20,002
" My shoes are Japanese.
My trousers are English"

37
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:24,404
"The cap on my head is Russian
but my heart is lndian"

38
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:56,506
" I venture into
the big, wide world"

39
00:07:57,076 --> 00:08:00,045
" I walk with my head held high"

40
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:09,311
" Where does my destination lie,
where will I ever settle?"

41
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:16,728
"The Creator up above us
only knows"

42
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:21,394
" Like true soldiers,
we forge ahead"

43
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:55,760
" Up and down,
round and round...."

44
00:08:56,135 --> 00:09:03,268
".... flow the eternal
waves of life"

45
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,512
" Foolish are those
who sit on the side lines"

46
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:15,917
" With little care
for their country's fate"

47
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:20,622
"To forge ahead is like life,
To stopstill is like death"

48
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:56,955
"There may be many a prince,
many a ruler"

49
00:09:57,196 --> 00:10:04,568
" I m like a prince,
just as spoilt"

50
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:09,974
" I sit on the mighty throne"

51
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:17,339
" Whenever I feel in the mood"

52
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:22,181
"Cry the crowds in mazement:
He looks very fmilar"

53
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:26,347
"The cap on my head is Russian
but my heart is lndian"

54
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,263
Alms!

55
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:53,677
Is Bombay filled
with only deaf people?

56
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:56,274
Only the deaf live here.
- And the blind

57
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:00,283
People in Bombay
hear the jingle of coins

58
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,282
This is Bombay, Bombay

59
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:06,855
High buildings are made of cement.
People have hearts of stone

60
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:10,159
Only one thing is sacred,
that's money

61
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,964
Move aside.
It's time for business

62
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,897
Business? You mean work?

63
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:23,134
That's what l' m looking for.
What can I do to earn my keep?

64
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,770
Do what I do... beg!

65
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,836
Tell me, what kind
of work can I find?

66
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:33,045
Let me think it over.
Are you educated?

67
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:37,652
B.A. passed. Look at my
degree. I have it here.

68
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:40,492
Reliable?

69
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:44,454
I have a medal for honesty,
a gold medal

70
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:49,157
Can you work hard?
- 24 hours a day.

71
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,494
No jobs here

72
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:55,601
No jobs?

73
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,878
No work even for
someone educated? Why?

74
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:03,943
Because this is Bombay.
It's a big city

75
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,614
If you look for work,
you' ll never find it

76
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,352
If you live by lying and
cheating there are 420 ways

77
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:19,695
Thank you, boss.
I've learnt a lot today

78
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:29,366
How much are these?
- Don't touch

79
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,943
8 annas a dozen,
2 annas for 3

80
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:34,977
What?

81
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:41,250
Eight annas a dozen
or two annas for three

82
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,057
Two annas for three.
No, three annas for two.

83
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:50,987
3 annas for 2. It isn't free.
How will I survive.

84
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,888
Take them at 2 annas for 3,
or get lost.

85
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,669
Why do you insist?
3 annas for 2

86
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:02,805
No way! 2 annas for 3

87
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:04,873
Think it over

88
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:14,077
Two annas for three
Three annas for two

89
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:16,887
He must be nuts

90
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:21,749
Come over here

91
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:28,228
You want 2 for 3 annas?
Here....

92
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:29,434
Now we' re talking

93
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,937
Oh yes, the money....
I don't have any

94
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,607
Some other time, but remember
3 annas for two

95
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,041
Here, pay me later

96
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,457
What if I never pay?

97
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,055
I' ll think my son ate them

98
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,799
How old is your son?
- He's of your age.

99
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,175
Thank you.

100
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,638
You won't misunderstand?

101
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:19,607
You don't have bananas
but a heart of gold

102
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:21,950
I' ll pay

103
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,150
He really is nuts, so naive

104
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:33,759
Like a banana?

105
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,630
Don't throw the skin anywhere

106
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,299
Some don't care about others

107
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:48,806
They peel the banana and
they fling.....

108
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:49,915
it anywhere

109
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:04,753
Uncouth people eating bananas
and throwing the peal anywhere.

110
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:29,880
What nonsense!
- This is Bombay

111
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,155
Everyone laughs at others

112
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:37,156
When they slip themselves,
they stop laughing

113
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,967
You' re right, brother

114
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:50,575
Tell me

115
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:54,270
Is there a pawn shop
in the area?

116
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,844
It's over there

117
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,410
Everything is sold and bought

118
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:06,250
Vidya, you've come
to collect your earrings?

119
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:10,456
No, I've come to sell
these bangles as well

120
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:13,792
The school isn't running well?

121
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,868
Get the money from the cashier.

122
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:21,765
Keep them. When you
have the money, return it

123
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,776
Who knows? Maybe I won't
ever see that day

124
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,276
Why talk like that?
It saddens me

125
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:37,511
One day, a prince will come
into your life

126
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:43,791
He' ll be handsome and rich.
When he sees you, he' ll be yours

127
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,293
And then he' ll marry you

128
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:49,031
He' ll shower you
with jewellery.

129
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:53,160
Then you can return
all you owe me in one go

130
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,368
Take the money. Greet your
father. I' ll visit on Friday

131
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:58,973
What is it?

132
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,046
What can I show you?

133
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,376
Nothing to buy,
something to sell

134
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:11,315
That's exactly
what they all say

135
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,524
What is it?
- Honesty

136
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,394
What?

137
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,526
I' ll sell honesty

138
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:23,929
Here it is

139
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:29,830
Rashtriya Orphanage
Honesty Medal

140
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,411
How much will I get?

141
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:37,344
If honesty is sold,
what's left in life?

142
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:40,685
Did you say something?
- No, nothing

143
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,521
Uncle, l' ll be off

144
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:54,158
You pawning it or selling it?

145
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,363
I thought I'd sell it

146
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:06,209
It's always been with me.
I' ll sell it and be done with it

147
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:08,540
Maybe someday....

148
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:11,977
Forty rupees

149
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,616
To get it back, pay 50

150
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:21,453
Now you watch! With these
40 rupees, l' ll buy Bombay

151
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:27,896
That's what everyone thinks.
But no one can buy Bombay.

152
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,397
Bombay buys everyone

153
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:32,604
Everyone ends up right here

154
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,760
I've got money

155
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,033
Here's a 2 rupees

156
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,638
Show!

157
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,778
I' ll pay 5 rupees.
I have it here.

158
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,787
My money!

159
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,487
Who's taken it?

160
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:29,786
You scoundrels!
420's! Crooks!

161
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:41,329
Thieves! You play cards
and you rob decent people

162
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,269
Aren't you ashmed?

163
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,845
Where do you think
you' re going?

164
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,315
Can't you see this is reserved?

165
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:32,724
Go away!

166
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,450
Would you mind
if I slept here tonight?

167
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:41,666
Pay a shirt

168
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:45,036
No shirt. I've a Russian
cap instead

169
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:49,400
Don't you get it? A deposit!
I mean money, cash

170
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:52,877
I paid 3 rupees.
pay half and stay

171
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:55,880
Rs. 1.50?

172
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:59,540
That much just to sleep here?

173
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,876
Yes, 1.50

174
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,479
What do you think? Even a dog
has to pay to sleep here

175
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:09,155
This Footpath is specially
very soft

176
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,885
Next door to Seth Dharmanand

177
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:20,098
When he sits to dinner
and the air blows here....

178
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,239
Ah, the aroma!

179
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:26,237
I don't have money even
to buy poison.

180
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,578
Let me sleep here tonight.

181
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:30,312
You are not home.

182
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:31,909
Why involve my fmily

183
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,912
Well, what will you do
if I sleep here?

184
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:43,587
What are you doing?

185
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:47,654
Picking on him as he's alone

186
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,262
May I ask if this pavement
is yours

187
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,739
No one owns this foothpath,
this is side-walk

188
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,947
It belongs to the State

189
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:09,551
Hello, lady banana seller
- How come you' re here?

190
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:13,157
What's going on?
- Nothing, really..

191
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,356
I was walking and felt
tired so I sat down

192
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:19,256
These brothers were
looking after me.

193
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:25,232
Were they beating you?
What were they up to?

194
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,971
Bravo! Hitting the poor boy.

195
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,982
Did they hurt you?

196
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:45,786
Where do you live?
Where do you sleep?

197
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:52,520
Nowhere. Where do people
who live nowhere, live?

198
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:57,490
Right here. Stay with us
on the government's pavement.

199
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:04,467
Listen everyone,
regard him as our son

200
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:08,843
Take good care of him.
Treat him well. Help him.

201
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,175
You' ll stay here

202
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,178
This foothpath is our domain

203
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,363
Sit comfortably

204
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,536
Bring tea and snacks

205
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:35,367
Don't forget the chillies.
Forgive me if I hurt you.

206
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:41,506
Don't worry. Ganga Ma's
children are like brothers

207
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,538
I' m like your brother,
what's your nme?

208
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:52,921
I told you all once,
our day would come

209
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,319
Our Raj is here

210
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,398
What do you do for a living?

211
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:07,329
I' m looking for work.
What a job that is!

212
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:12,805
You seem to be new here,
that's why you look for work

213
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:15,873
Or else you'd have fun
like us

214
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:18,578
What do you do?

215
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:21,415
Jobless!

216
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:33,563
Our stories can be told
in a single word : "jobless".

217
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:38,759
Tell us your story.
Where are you from?

218
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:43,265
If we' re to be as one,
tell your story.

219
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:46,702
Tell us something exciting,
I feel sad today

220
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:31,314
"O Gently people,
hear this story"

221
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:42,728
" A simple story with no frills,
aimed to give many thrills"

222
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,057
" I was once a boy
of a poor fmily...."

223
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,787
".... who inherited
his mother's destiny"

224
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:22,006
"Grief and suffering
" Pain and breath did blend"

225
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:47,797
" Alas! With a face such as mine"

226
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:52,425
" A thief and l
look one of a kind'

227
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:03,511
"On the street, one day,
for no rhyme or reason"

228
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,707
" An officer took me away"

229
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,063
" An Officer
Peered over his spectacles"

230
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:38,277
" He looked me over
barring no obstacles"

231
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,543
"Said he : "Can you see no more" "

232
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,951
" He' s the warden' s brother-in-law"

233
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:18,517
" l' m still bound by misery
l' m happy but not in ecstasy"

234
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:29,199
" My destination lies before me.
My feet are tied for all to see"

235
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,494
" Rich folk hinder the fun"

236
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:01,031
" Heed me but tell none"

237
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:05,567
" Don't walk with head down"

238
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:16,369
" Don't sing without rhyme.
Don't shout without reason"

239
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:18,981
"Or you will end up in prison!"

240
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:08,052
Why were you sleeping here?
- Sir?

241
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:13,327
The problem is,
I had a row with my wife

242
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:15,499
She threw me out of the house

243
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:18,335
You know the women
of today are like men

244
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:22,767
Get lost.

245
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:25,702
Is this a place to sleep?
Get lost.

246
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:36,776
Go on! He must be a newcomer.
He's nuts

247
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,728
What are you doing?

248
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:53,199
Can't you see?

249
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:56,870
Why are you doing that?

250
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:04,279
To see this wretched world....

251
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:05,939
You have to look at it
upside down

252
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:09,951
All the leaders of the
country do the sme thing

253
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:11,551
Then, they see it right

254
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:16,821
Behave yourself
or l' ll straighten you out

255
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:19,229
Constable, is this a crime?

256
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,128
Get along,

257
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,798
You broke the castle

258
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:04,472
Some people are like that,
they can destroy, not build

259
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,601
They sell honest and sin

260
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,612
What must they do?

261
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,141
Drown!

262
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:16,783
I agree

263
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,638
Hey you! Wait, Stop!

264
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:21,146
Were you trying
to commit suicide?

265
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,156
What? Me? Committing suicide?

266
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:31,855
Yes, suicide
- You mean suicide?

267
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:40,033
You said that people
like me should drown

268
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:45,698
That was....
I mean, l' m sorry

269
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,711
You' re right, people
like me should drown.

270
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:55,515
It's a sin
to commit suicide

271
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,721
You won't will you?

272
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,919
Of course, I will

273
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,388
It's the last sin

274
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,728
So what if you saved me?

275
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,898
Listen, I won't
let you commit suicide.

276
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:13,562
Can you stop me, if l
want to take my life?

277
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:16,899
I' ll call the police
to stop you

278
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:28,013
He's....
- What are you up to?

279
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,917
I' m up to something,
but will she agree?

280
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:33,622
He

281
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,161
Let me tell you, come this way

282
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:43,362
She's the one
- Your wife?

283
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,762
Absolutely

284
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:49,773
She's pretty

285
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:54,775
Don't get taken in by her face,
she's poison

286
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:57,504
She jumped into the sea,
I had to get her out

287
00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:59,946
She says : " l' ll drown and
take you with me "

288
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,379
She refuses to go home

289
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,549
So that's it? I' ll fix her

290
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:07,791
You' ll save a mariage
from breaking up

291
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:12,794
What is it?
- Go home

292
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:15,196
Where?
- Home

293
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:19,462
You, too
- As you say, Constable

294
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:22,997
Come, let's go
Don't be cross

295
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:28,069
What are you saying?
Who are you to order me?

296
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,715
Hear that? She says who
m I to order me?

297
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,208
Tell her who I m

298
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:39,823
Go home or else
to the police station

299
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,556
Why? What have I done?

300
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,695
Committing suicide

301
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:47,160
But I was...

302
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:50,828
She says she dived in
save me

303
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:55,334
Not another word from you.
Go home

304
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,365
Why bicker like children?

305
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:06,305
Wives should not leave
their homes like that

306
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:12,112
You' re of the modern generation.
A woman is a home's goddess.

307
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:19,125
Each lndian woman should
regard her husband as a God.

308
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,592
That's enough!
This is my home. Now go

309
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:26,268
Have you started again?
Get inside.

310
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,147
You' re still following me?

311
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:41,883
I see you home, and you
say I've no manners

312
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:44,888
Vidya?

313
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:47,182
What is it?
- I've had it! Father

314
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,152
I will tell him

315
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,728
You can't go inside
- Why not?

316
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:53,723
Let me meet him

317
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,098
Who are you arguing with?

318
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:58,132
She is arguing with me, father.

319
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,762
Who are you?
- He's....

320
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:02,636
Shri. Ranbir Raj

321
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,899
My father,
Pandit Omkarnath Shastri

322
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:11,779
He dived into the sea
- lnto the sea

323
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:16,045
Tell her not
to jump into such deep waters

324
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:19,315
Don't interrupt, l' m talking.
Luckily....

325
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,390
I was there

326
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:26,089
Or else, she would have been

327
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:30,627
I didn't jump in
- Don't play with life

328
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:34,927
That's what I said too,
our life is given by God

329
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,936
To misuse it is ungrateful

330
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:39,772
He jumped in....

331
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:44,274
Change your clothes.
I' ll sit for a while.

332
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:47,678
Be careful or you might
catch pneumonia.

333
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:53,354
He's right. Go and
change your clothes

334
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,216
Serve some tea to
our guest

335
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:00,623
Sit down.

336
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:08,636
Thank you, my son.
You've done

337
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:11,236
She's all I have in the world

338
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:13,499
It was my duty

339
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:16,639
Who helps anyone these days?

340
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:18,982
You risked your life for her.

341
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:23,815
To jump in the sea is simple.
I can swin for miles

342
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:28,123
It's a pity that
my expensive suit got wet

343
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:33,830
Hurry with tea,
he might catch a cold

344
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:37,466
You' re cheerful

345
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,275
You put yourself
to such bother

346
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:49,141
The tea is hot, be careful

347
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:52,811
Liars burn tongues

348
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:55,409
Did you burn yours?

349
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:58,715
Not my tongue, but my heart

350
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:05,853
You' re a very funny fellow.
Hurry, Vidya

351
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:07,824
The kids are waiting

352
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:09,862
Hers?

353
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:12,169
She has fifty

354
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:15,702
Fifty, my God!

355
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,908
Father, I'd better go

356
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:25,776
We have a small school
- A school?

357
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:28,919
I see!

358
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:36,056
Since I've been paralysed,
Vidya has run the school

359
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:39,185
We live on little

360
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:41,394
The poor live here

361
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,233
We are poor, too.
We have nothing better to offer you.

362
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:54,237
We don't have even a comfortable
chair for you to sit.

363
00:41:57,114 --> 00:42:02,074
It's first class.
Don't let it worry you

364
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,813
Be careful! Are you hurt?

365
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:08,489
Don't worry

366
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:13,256
It isn't your fault.
I've put on a little weight.

367
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:24,898
"One little seed, two seeds
Seed on seed"

368
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:37,109
"On the roof the girl dances,
The crazy boy takes his chances"

369
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,195
"Guess!"

370
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:48,565
" Pomegranate"

371
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,646
"There lived
a little girl called Lalbai"

372
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:14,749
'She wears a red skirt
that a pie"

373
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:28,001
"She burns your mouth
and she makes your cry"

374
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:36,440
" Have a guess!"

375
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:39,944
" A chilli!"

376
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:57,595
" It's green and
It's surrounded with pearls"

377
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:05,800
" Deep in the garden
of the king it sways and whirls"

378
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:19,211
" lts hair is quite wild
and filled with curls"

379
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:28,691
"Guess!"

380
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,892
"Corn!"

381
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:48,748
" It's a creature
with money spread on its tail'

382
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:56,949
" It wears
a crown on its head like a sail"

383
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:10,270
" It dances full of glee,
Full of joy in a gale."

384
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:19,612
"Guess!"

385
00:45:20,317 --> 00:45:21,545
" A peacock!"

386
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:32,626
"One little seed, two seeds
Seed on seed"

387
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:09,059
"Though its quite out of sight,
It stays close and near"

388
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,459
" It eats, it drinks,
have little or no fear"

389
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:18,867
" Don't fall into its snare,
Be careful, be wise, beware"

390
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:27,346
"Guess!"

391
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:30,353
" Misery!"

392
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:32,348
" No! It's me!"

393
00:46:48,405 --> 00:46:50,100
Did you see?

394
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:51,704
She lost her own gme.

395
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:54,377
Teacher lost the gme
she lost!

396
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:56,913
Celebrate with a holiday.
Go home

397
00:46:58,749 --> 00:46:59,977
Sit down all of you!

398
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,121
Come back!
Or you will be in for it

399
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:09,188
Uncouth, illiterate!

400
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:10,925
Letting them go

401
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:16,556
Why get so cross?
Let them have some fun

402
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,131
Fun and gme, eh?

403
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:20,793
To be useless like you?

404
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:27,069
True, I don't have
any work but....

405
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:29,412
illiterate....

406
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,279
I' m not. That's the tragedy

407
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:35,815
If I were, I would be a labourer

408
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:40,685
What can I do? I m a graduate

409
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:43,918
That's an even bigger lie!

410
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:47,624
Look at you.
Do you look educated?

411
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:50,429
My appearance fools you

412
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,936
If I were dressed
grandly and had a car....

413
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:57,302
....You wouln't have called
me illiterate

414
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,608
I don't blme you.
The world is not compassionate

415
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:05,244
Clothes make a man

416
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:09,448
Fine clothes are more imporatant
than human sentiments

417
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:14,282
That isn't true.
We aren't rich.

418
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,622
You see, poor people live here

419
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:23,296
It's shmeful that
the poor forget the poor

420
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:37,947
Seeing how scruffy I look,
one may assume l' m uneducated.

421
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:41,814
So I carry my diploma with me

422
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:47,289
Look.... I m a graduate.
B.A. Pass

423
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:54,497
I m very sorry

424
00:48:56,533 --> 00:49:02,995
I don't understand why you
dress and behave like a clown

425
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:16,247
You've got to stand on your
head to see the world straight.

426
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:21,089
The mask of a clown
is just the thing you need

427
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:30,359
If you ask me, the best way to
hide one's suffering is to don....

428
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:33,058
....the mask of a clown.
It's very useful

429
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:45,374
Stay longer.
- Is Panditji in?

430
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:52,214
Can I help you?
- Thank you, Vidya

431
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,155
If I need help,
l' ll come to you

432
00:49:55,592 --> 00:50:00,291
Right now I want to help myself.
My destiny beckons me

433
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,391
What does your fate have
in store for you?

434
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:07,400
Whatever I do,
whichever path I tread....

435
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:13,839
.... you' ll see,
l' ll become fmous and rich

436
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:15,570
No one will look down on me

437
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:17,244
I shall command respect
and admiration.

438
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:24,379
Long live Dharmanand

439
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:34,390
Bombayities, accept my greetings

440
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:37,223
Hindus: " Rm Rm", Muslims: "Salm"

441
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:40,194
Morning to Christians and
"Sat Sri Akal" to Sikhs

442
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:47,599
You all know the importance
given to religion and culture

443
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:51,003
Friends, look at my clothes

444
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:56,608
From head to foot I m dressed
in clothes made in lndia

445
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:00,285
Gentlemen, look at me!

446
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:03,182
My shoes are Japanese,
my trousers are British

447
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:06,022
My cap is Russian, but
my heart is lndian

448
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:12,624
Let me repeat, the one thing
that's lndian is my heart

449
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:19,300
Our greatest preblem is....

450
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:20,376
Bread!

451
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:25,637
Bread! Chapatis, nan,
idli, dosa

452
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:29,482
Whatever you call it,
bread is most essential.

453
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:30,653
Do I lie?

454
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:32,321
No, It's the truth

455
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:38,484
The problem of bread is one of
the soul and peace of mind

456
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:41,162
You cannot find peace of mind
if you go hungry

457
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:42,661
That's right!

458
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:50,135
Many cloud over real issues
like history and religion

459
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,001
Putting emphasis on....
.... bread

460
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:57,577
Brothers who want to eat
real bread, come to me

461
00:51:57,814 --> 00:52:00,009
To swallow air, go over there

462
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,686
Silence!

463
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:12,492
Brothers and Sisters! Heed the
call of time, the call of truth

464
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:16,956
Listen!

465
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:26,300
Come to me, lovers of bread

466
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:29,177
No one is better equipped
to solve this

467
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:31,541
I will ask you one thing....

468
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:34,376
What is required to eat bread?

469
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:37,052
Money?
-That's it. Bravo!

470
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:39,379
One thing's more important
than money

471
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:41,553
You can deceive others

472
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:44,985
You can beg, borrow or steal
for bread

473
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:47,896
But you can never
eat breat without....

474
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:49,725
TEETH! Yes, brothers, teeth!

475
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:54,736
Is that clear to everyone?

476
00:52:55,272 --> 00:52:58,332
If your teeth are not strong,
how can you chew properly?

477
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:01,338
It will lead to indigestion....

478
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:02,911
weakness and disease

479
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:05,081
This will end up by weakening
the entire nation

480
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:09,912
Then enemies can invade
and conquer us, making us slaves

481
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:14,283
If you want to keep lndia free
and the nation stronger....

482
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:15,924
Preserve your teeth!

483
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:20,357
Brush them with my invention :
SUN AND MOON TOOTH POWDER

484
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:23,599
Teeth will sparkle
like the moon, the sun

485
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,165
Four annas each!

486
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:28,771
A bottle for me.

487
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:32,775
Let's get in line

488
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:39,510
Someone's selling Tooth Powder.
I see.... a 420

489
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:47,620
Your teeth may be hurting, too.
Why not try that powder?

490
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:10,276
Tell us something,
what's the powder made of?

491
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:12,808
Does it contain crushed bones?

492
00:54:13,116 --> 00:54:17,075
There's only coal and sand
from Chowpatty in this

493
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:21,817
Did you hear that?
He's been cheating us

494
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:30,497
Instead of powder,
he's selling sand. Hit him!

495
00:54:58,395 --> 00:54:59,692
Where did they hit you?

496
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:03,593
Well, what do you
think you are doing?

497
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:05,735
It hurts

498
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:15,677
Stop it or you' ll singe him

499
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:19,272
Tell me what the problem is

500
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:22,713
He was selling sand as
tooth-powder, he asked for it

501
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:26,013
He won't easily forget
the thrashing he got

502
00:55:26,189 --> 00:55:27,713
Why laugh?

503
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:32,153
Tell me son, since when have
you started racketeering?

504
00:55:34,597 --> 00:55:38,624
What else can I do, Ganga Ma?
- Drink it up while it's hot

505
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,632
Rest for a few days.
This is your home

506
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,172
Call it a footh, not a home

507
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:50,641
He's crazy. If we have
a foothpath, we' ll have a home

508
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:56,752
Raj, you' re educated.
Tell us it can be possible

509
00:55:56,953 --> 00:55:59,717
One day, our government
will build us homes

510
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:01,090
Fine homes

511
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:05,457
It's possible that
like us will have homes

512
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:10,524
How shall we pay the rent?

513
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:14,264
For anything one must have a job

514
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:15,935
A worthwhile job

515
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:16,935
Listen!

516
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:18,606
I was working in a laundry

517
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:21,675
I was paid 45 rupees a month

518
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:24,742
The owner cut 20 rupees
because I burnt a cloth

519
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:25,948
Is that fair?

520
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:27,208
I spit at honest work

521
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:32,749
You left the job? But why?

522
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:34,354
I was fed up. I quit

523
00:56:35,992 --> 00:56:38,825
You won't go back?

524
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,958
I' ll find work

525
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:43,827
Where did you work?

526
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:45,794
At the JAl BHARAT Laundry

527
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:04,850
Have you worked in one?

528
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:10,516
I worked at the Sunlight Soap
factory, I mean laundry

529
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:14,324
I can't tell you
how well I wash clothes

530
00:57:15,832 --> 00:57:16,799
Do you have an iron?

531
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:24,871
A wife? How can l? I don't
have a job or a house.

532
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:27,506
I didn't say a `Wife',
but an iron!

533
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:35,347
I thought you said a `Wife'.
About the ironing, sir....

534
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:37,017
I' m from a line of washermen

535
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,553
You look a clown.
Can you work hard?

536
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:42,625
Yes, Sir!

537
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:45,493
Will you be honest?
- Yes, Sir.

538
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:48,019
You've got the job.

539
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:57,196
Thank you sir, thank you.

540
00:57:58,074 --> 00:58:01,043
You' ll be paid 45 rupees.
Start now.

541
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:20,196
Rm, how is it spelt?
-R....A....M

542
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:24,459
Raj, how is it spelt?
-R....A....J

543
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:35,711
Once, again, children!

544
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,889
I m sorry,
I can't understand you

545
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:55,289
Why do you dress like this
and act like a clown?

546
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:16,850
Who is it?
Oh, it's you!

547
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:21,385
How are you?
I cme to give you this

548
00:59:21,824 --> 00:59:24,987
Why did you take the trouble?
-lt was my duty.

549
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:27,930
How is Panditji?
How are you?

550
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:30,626
I've some news.
I have bought a laundry

551
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:34,302
It's in Parsi bazaar

552
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:35,999
To get there walk....

553
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:41,303
....just left of Kharsi Parsi
If you feel like it, come visit

554
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:42,806
I got a new suit

555
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:48,150
I couldn't visit earlier,
l' m so busy at work

556
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:50,876
At last, I found
a spare moment today

557
00:59:56,593 --> 01:00:02,327
I m very busy.
It's late. I' ll go now.

558
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:09,064
I thought I just saw you
putting on a coat

559
01:01:09,265 --> 01:01:10,562
Fooled by appearance

560
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:15,030
Clothes are tailored for human
beings and not vice-verse

561
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:16,238
I don't understand

562
01:01:18,107 --> 01:01:19,074
The dress....

563
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:22,244
The man. What do you say?

564
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:29,251
I cme to see how
your laundry is doing

565
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:30,849
Very well

566
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:32,384
1 5 or 20 people work here

567
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:35,590
I' m the boss
We eat and drink well

568
01:01:36,726 --> 01:01:40,526
I didn't wear the suit.
It may get spoilt in the rain.

569
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:43,162
What will you have?

570
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:46,067
Where will you have tea?

571
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:49,597
At the Taj or at the Greens?

572
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:52,266
They' re too far away

573
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:53,908
I' m very tired as well

574
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:59,073
The local foothpath Palace Hotel.
It isn't very far

575
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:15,022
Here's the foothpath restaurant.
Limited furniture

576
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:18,296
Make yourself comfortable,
l' ll be back

577
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:24,302
Two special teas, with milk and
sugar.... double the tea

578
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:26,474
And the unpaid bills?

579
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:31,170
You don't seem to see
the delicate predicment l' m in

580
01:02:32,348 --> 01:02:35,579
Please wait until I get paid.
Look who's here with me.

581
01:02:36,352 --> 01:02:37,649
Why should I care?

582
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:40,121
You already owe me 6 rupees
10 annas

583
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:43,051
Please understand

584
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:49,826
Let me have some tea,
my honour's at stake

585
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:52,857
At least, pay for today's order

586
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:04,204
Taste Uncle's tea,
you won't go else where

587
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:19,552
Have you got two annas?
- You mean some change?

588
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:24,162
I've no change for a hundred
and uncle never has any either

589
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:25,501
Right, Uncle?

590
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:00,533
Can I ask something?

591
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,136
If two decent young people
fall in love....

592
01:04:08,044 --> 01:04:09,409
They should marry, right?

593
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:15,884
When they marry,
they must have children

594
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:23,923
They will need a home and
clothes to dress the children

595
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:27,586
Later, the children must
be sent to school

596
01:04:31,467 --> 01:04:34,231
I earn only rupees 45
at the laundry

597
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:39,064
How can I drem of a marriage
life on 45 rupees, tell me?

598
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:45,974
A man alone cannot do it, but
if both of them work together

599
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:51,711
You mean.... Vidya, you and l?

600
01:05:15,511 --> 01:05:18,139
I' ll come to talk
to your father tomorrow

601
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:29,447
" We' re in love,
We know it's passion"

602
01:06:29,785 --> 01:06:32,754
" Why are our hearts
filled with apprehension?"

603
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:43,831
" My heart warns me
the path ahead isn't easy"

604
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,697
" Little do we know where we go
Our destination is hazy."

605
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:38,210
" Assure me no change
will enter our love's rhyme."

606
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:45,621
" Assure me you' ll
not change with passing time"

607
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:49,629
"One day,
if you' re no longer mine"

608
01:07:49,999 --> 01:07:52,900
"The moon will no longer shine"

609
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:51,692
" Each night will be
filled with our story"

610
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:58,794
"The youth of tomorrow
will sing our melody"

611
01:08:59,535 --> 01:09:02,834
" Neither you nor I will remain"

612
01:09:03,272 --> 01:09:06,173
" But the tokens
of our love will reign."

613
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:16,107
Constable! It's you.

614
01:10:18,747 --> 01:10:21,978
Is your wife still angry?

615
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:24,779
Wife? The iron!

616
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:27,445
Oh Lord! Fire! Water!

617
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,473
Fetch some water!

618
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:48,677
Hurry up, bring the water!

619
01:10:58,354 --> 01:10:59,821
What's going on?
What's the matter?

620
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:02,156
What's this nonsense?

621
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:04,085
Stop this nonsense!

622
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:41,863
Who did it?

623
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:44,866
Whose iron is this?

624
01:11:47,236 --> 01:11:51,536
It was my mistake,
I left my iron here

625
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:52,874
Well done!

626
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:56,407
You spoke the truth,
you will be fined

627
01:11:56,712 --> 01:12:00,876
You' ll work tomorrow as well.
- But tomorrow's Sunday!

628
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:03,208
I must see someone.
- Shut Up!

629
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:39,310
Three jacks

630
01:13:42,017 --> 01:13:43,314
Three queens

631
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:47,789
What about you? Three kings

632
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:50,485
Let me see

633
01:13:50,793 --> 01:13:52,260
Three aces

634
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:03,201
Excellent!

635
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:09,839
Excuse me Madm,
here are the clothes

636
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:13,810
I' m only here
delivering clothes

637
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:15,083
Must be John's

638
01:14:16,051 --> 01:14:17,678
That's right

639
01:14:18,053 --> 01:14:23,013
I' m from Sunlight Laundry,
I mean the Bharat Laundry

640
01:14:24,259 --> 01:14:26,352
Sit down

641
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:30,359
It was my mistake....
Please forgive me

642
01:14:32,067 --> 01:14:34,900
Don't report it
or else l' ll be fired

643
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:36,430
Sit down!

644
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:43,374
Madm Please,
I don't know anything

645
01:14:44,746 --> 01:14:49,046
Don't misunderstand me,
I was only passing time

646
01:14:50,085 --> 01:14:51,052
Deal now.

647
01:14:59,461 --> 01:15:01,190
Look at your cards, 3 aces

648
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:04,058
It's the truth,
l' m not a crook, l' m not a 420

649
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:22,010
I'd better be off

650
01:15:30,993 --> 01:15:34,087
I' m not a cardsharp.
Don't report me to the police.

651
01:15:34,329 --> 01:15:36,957
I can't afford to lose my job.

652
01:15:37,466 --> 01:15:40,094
Here's the bill. Please sign it.

653
01:15:42,804 --> 01:15:45,796
Sit down. I' ll be back

654
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:56,117
Come here, Johnny

655
01:15:56,485 --> 01:15:59,852
Meet a true magician

656
01:16:00,622 --> 01:16:02,283
He deals and three aces appear

657
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:06,987
Always drinking!

658
01:16:07,296 --> 01:16:08,456
I wish you were alert

659
01:16:10,165 --> 01:16:11,462
We've to rush to the party
