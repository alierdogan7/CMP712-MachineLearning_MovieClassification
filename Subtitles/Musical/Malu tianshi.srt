Autumn 1935
In the world of Shanghai's underclass.

43
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,050
Xiaohong. Come here.

44
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,530
What do you think you were going to do?

45
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,050
Such a mature girl, with a wild spirit.

46
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:11,186
- What song do you want to hear?
- Anything is fine.

47
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:14,451
How about the "Song of Four Seasons", OK?

48
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,878
- Fine...fine, whatever.
- OK, OK.

49
00:07:36,894 --> 00:07:42,633
<i>Springtime has arrived and
green fills the window.</i>

50
00:07:42,807 --> 00:07:48,290
<i>Under the window the maiden
embroiders a pair of mandarin ducks.</i>

51
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:55,725
<i>Suddenly a ruthless blow</i>

52
00:07:56,538 --> 00:08:03,717
<i>Splits the ducks apart</i>

53
00:08:10,245 --> 00:08:15,670
<i>Summer has arrived and
the willow fronds are long</i>

54
00:08:16,193 --> 00:08:21,769
<i>The maiden drifts south of the river</i>

55
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:29,250
<i>The wind and sun is fine on
the south and north parts of the river</i>

56
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:36,325
<i>But how can it compare to
the green sorghum of home?</i>

57
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:48,673
<i>Autumn has arrived and
the lotus flowers are fragrant</i>

58
00:08:49,184 --> 00:08:54,609
<i>Each night the maiden
dreams of her home town</i>

59
00:08:55,481 --> 00:09:02,427
<i>Waking up, she doesn't see
her dad and mom's faces</i>

60
00:09:02,822 --> 00:09:10,234
<i>She only sees the bright moon
in front of her window.</i>

61
00:09:16,797 --> 00:09:22,152
<i>Winter has arrived and
the snow is wide and vast</i>

62
00:09:22,803 --> 00:09:28,216
<i>Winter clothes are mended and
sent to her husband</i>

63
00:09:28,623 --> 00:09:35,581
<i>Flesh and blood built
the length of the Great Wall</i>

64
00:09:36,313 --> 00:09:44,340
<i>I wish I could be Meng Jiang of those days</i>

65
00:09:46,478 --> 00:09:48,127
That girl is really not bad.

66
00:09:48,557 --> 00:09:50,253
You really like her?

67
00:09:50,369 --> 00:09:54,772
- Yes
- I know the string player. Ah, Old Wang!

68
00:09:55,051 --> 00:09:58,710
Yes, Old Chen...thank you.

69
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,171
- When did you get here?
- Please sit.

70
00:10:03,229 --> 00:10:04,995
- Thank you.
- This is Mr. Gu.

71
00:10:05,088 --> 00:10:08,422
- Oh, ah...
- That's right, the Mr. Gu.

72
00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:10,422
Ah, I've wanted to meet you for a long time!

73
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,613
Mr Gu really enjoyed your song girl.

74
00:10:14,729 --> 00:10:18,911
Oh, really? I'll call her over here.
Xiao Hong, come here.

75
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,726
- Greet Mr. Gu.
- Mr. Gu.

76
00:10:30,911 --> 00:10:32,724
Really not bad!

77
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,035
Sit, take a seat.

78
00:10:46,071 --> 00:10:48,836
- Hey, Lu.
- Hey, you scared me there.

79
00:10:48,987 --> 00:10:51,287
- Whats up?
- You're such scaredy pants!

80
00:10:51,287 --> 00:10:53,018
- You're half done?
- Yea, half done.

81
00:10:53,088 --> 00:10:54,923
Nice smell.

82
00:10:56,387 --> 00:10:59,105
- Hey boss, how's business?
- So-so.

83
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,112
OK, OK, enough shaving heads already.
Let's go to my place and have fun. Hurry up!

84
00:11:04,112 --> 00:11:05,645
OK, OK.

85
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:10,698
I'm going out for a while.
Give him a careful shave..

86
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,555
Do a good job. You don't want to
hurt a person's head.

87
00:11:53,438 --> 00:11:54,958
<i>Peaceful Lane</i>

88
00:12:18,621 --> 00:12:21,978
- Monster, you scared him to death.
- Baby, don't be afraid.

89
00:12:22,443 --> 00:12:25,707
The little darling heard your trumpet from far off,
so he knew you were on your way home.

90
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:28,356
Is that so? What a good baby!

91
00:12:28,518 --> 00:12:31,806
Look, are Uncle's Chen's foreign clothes nice?

92
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,676
They're ugly!

93
00:12:33,862 --> 00:12:36,383
Look, does Uncle Chen look like a foreign soldier?

94
00:12:37,138 --> 00:12:41,262
Do I? Baby, I'll do some military drills
for you to see, OK?

95
00:12:41,657 --> 00:12:45,235
Just watch me!
One, two, one, two.

96
00:12:45,374 --> 00:12:46,908
Attention!

97
00:12:48,104 --> 00:12:49,754
Little darling, let Uncle Chen hold you.

98
00:12:50,183 --> 00:12:53,273
I won't hold him... I won't.
Let me kiss him.

99
00:12:53,378 --> 00:12:55,504
Don't let him kiss you. He's got bad breath.

100
00:12:55,643 --> 00:12:57,850
Don't let him kiss.
He's got bad breath, isn't that right?

101
00:13:16,321 --> 00:13:18,191
She's gone downstairs.

102
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:21,583
The landlady seems to have a little thing for you.

103
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:24,290
'He's got bad breath, don't let him kiss you, don't let him.'

104
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:29,959
Ugh, lots of little hairs.

105
00:13:30,981 --> 00:13:35,175
- Chen, how does she know if you have bad breath?
- Get out of here!

106
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:40,437
Like a foreign soldier indeed! Would a
foreign soldier have only this much left of his shirt?

107
00:13:49,405 --> 00:13:52,356
OK, enough already. If you can't talk,
then try not to talk so much, OK?

108
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,651
- Chen, He's found a picture.
- Let's hang it up

109
00:13:59,848 --> 00:14:03,426
- OK, but let me write something on it first.
- That's OK, I'll write.

110
00:14:03,694 --> 00:14:05,426
Bring me a brush.

111
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:15,368
In the saying "Have prosperity shared,
Have difficulty beared", how do you write "difficulty"?

112
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,481
Idiot! Can't even write the character
for 'difficult'. I'm coming.

113
00:14:21,212 --> 00:14:23,848
One, two, three. Three idiots!

114
00:14:23,941 --> 00:14:25,939
- Let me do it.
- OK, You do it.

115
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:31,794
together...

116
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:33,467
shared.

117
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,467
Have...

118
00:14:35,907 --> 00:14:36,999
difficulty

119
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,645
Difficulty...difficulty...difficulty...

120
00:14:43,376 --> 00:14:45,723
Difficulty...difficulty...

121
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:48,650
Wang, how do you write the character for difficult?

122
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:53,703
Isn't 'difficulty' easy? It's about the same
as the character for chicken.

123
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:57,897
One side looks like the character 'beauty',
as in talented scholar and beautiful maiden...

124
00:14:58,025 --> 00:15:00,592
and the other side is like the
"hai" in Shanghai. Oh, no...

125
00:15:00,696 --> 00:15:03,694
Its like the "jin" in Tianjin...
no, that's not right either.

126
00:15:04,983 --> 00:15:06,816
Slow down...

127
00:15:06,816 --> 00:15:08,816
'Difficult'...'Difficult'

128
00:15:09,328 --> 00:15:11,163
It's on the tip of my tongue.

129
00:15:12,987 --> 00:15:14,671
Now I remember.

130
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:17,192
It was in yesterday's paper.

131
00:15:18,598 --> 00:15:21,409
<i>The nation faces difficulties, so everyone
must stand up and take responsibility.<i>

132
00:15:21,548 --> 00:15:22,942
Here it is.

133
00:15:26,846 --> 00:15:30,063
See, look here, isn't this half of the character
beauty in 'talented scholar and beauty'?

134
00:15:31,794 --> 00:15:35,407
But, that's not half of the 'hai' in Shanghai
and it isn't half of the  'jin' in Tianjin.

135
00:15:35,407 --> 00:15:37,407
It's the 'Han' half of Hankou.

136
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:42,145
Although you got the place wrong,
you knew the character.

137
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,905
"Have prosperity together shared,
Have difficulty together beared"

138
00:15:49,974 --> 00:15:51,473
Good. Here, take it.

139
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:53,634
Hey, look, a wireless telegram for you!

140
00:15:53,727 --> 00:15:57,119
Be quiet. Hide.
Time for some tricks!

141
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:44,305
Xiaohong!

142
00:17:53,552 --> 00:17:55,028
Look.

143
00:17:58,942 --> 00:18:00,592
See how dirty it is

144
00:18:00,801 --> 00:18:03,961
Such a big girl. You can't even do
something as little as this.

145
00:18:07,074 --> 00:18:08,782
All you know how to do is eat!

146
00:18:12,197 --> 00:18:15,159
What do you think of what I was
just telling you? What do you think?

147
00:18:15,647 --> 00:18:18,331
Haven't I told you already?
I don't have any.

148
00:18:18,435 --> 00:18:21,026
Lao Lao, your temper is back.

149
00:18:21,177 --> 00:18:25,382
You know as well as I do how Gu has
deals going on all over Shanghai.

150
00:18:25,951 --> 00:18:28,913
It wasn't easy to get a chance to meet him today.

151
00:18:29,122 --> 00:18:33,781
I should go have a drink with him
and become friends. Right?

152
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,881
Come on, quick, give me the money!

153
00:18:49,266 --> 00:18:51,322
Just like a ghost!

154
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,296
Skulking around without making a sound.

155
00:24:06,017 --> 00:24:09,781
Not even a simple 3 tile straight!
Old Liu, you go ahead and play for me.

156
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:11,965
I might as well go home to sleep.

157
00:24:13,556 --> 00:24:15,403
It's enough to drive one crazy.

158
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:29,668
Wait up! Why do you run away whenever
you see me? I did nothing wrong to you.

159
00:24:30,063 --> 00:24:34,106
It was just that we weren't careful enough
and the old lady found about us.

160
00:24:34,466 --> 00:24:39,577
She was jealous, she beat you, but 
what could I say about it, don't you think...

161
00:24:43,155 --> 00:24:47,744
You two are up to your tricks again.
No wonder I lost money.

162
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,044
Shameless bitch!

163
00:24:54,737 --> 00:24:56,735
You leave with an empty pocketbook
and come back empty too!

164
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:00,034
Shameless bitch! Get lost!

165
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:25,881
<i>You and I are of the same heart...</i>

166
00:26:39,821 --> 00:26:46,420
<i>To the ends of the earth, 
oh, to the edge of the sea</i>

167
00:26:46,954 --> 00:26:53,134
<i>I seek, oh, seek the soul mate
who understands my song</i>

168
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:57,351
<i>This little sister sings...</i>

169
00:26:57,432 --> 00:26:59,860
<i>and her man plays along</i>

170
00:26:59,988 --> 00:27:05,320
<i>You and I are of the same heart</i>

171
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,475

We're here, we're here.

00:29:45,676 --> 00:29:49,187
Very handsome; like a young man under twenty.

187
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,306
- Enough already.
- Really, it's true.

- Finished?
- Finished.

189
00:29:59,412 --> 00:30:01,123
Xiao Hong, let's go.

190
00:30:02,617 --> 00:30:04,046
I'll take you out for some fun.

191
00:30:04,902 --> 00:30:07,697
- OK?
- OK.

192
00:30:10,072 --> 00:30:12,485
- Any tip?
- No.

193
00:30:13,238 --> 00:30:14,961

<i>Two dan of rice for one yuan!</i>

196
00:30:33,855 --> 00:30:35,680
<i> One dan of rice for one yuan!
Do you want to buy?</i>

197
00:30:37,123 --> 00:30:40,314
<i>Will you buy if I drop the price?
Two dan of rice for one yuan!</i>

198
00:30:46,365 --> 00:30:47,987
What other dishes will you have?

199
00:30:48,102 --> 00:30:52,148
Bring a sauteed tripe,
chicken fillets, and stir fried shrimp.

200
00:30:52,429 --> 00:30:53,795
Anything else?

201
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,795
- Bring it out and we'll see.
- OK.

202
00:30:57,574 --> 00:30:59,285
Go. Get lost!

203
00:31:01,314 --> 00:31:03,753
I saw it, I saw it with my own eyes.

204
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,480
After they bought the fabric, they went
to a restaurant for some snacks.

205
00:31:07,774 --> 00:31:12,868
I followed them up there too,
until the waiter chased me off.

206
00:31:12,944 --> 00:31:15,574
I saw Xiao Hong, she was really happy.

207
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:19,634
When that fatty gave her some
cloth at the foreign fabric shop...

208
00:31:19,863 --> 00:31:21,076
...she was also very happy.

209
00:31:21,076 --> 00:31:23,987
As soon as I saw that fatty,
I knew he was up to no good.

210
00:31:24,536 --> 00:31:27,536
That's why I had Ah Bing follow him.

211
00:31:28,978 --> 00:31:31,965
See, my eyes weren't wrong when I saw it!

212
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:42,702
Enough already!
If you can't speak, then shut up.

213
00:33:17,693 --> 00:33:20,080
- What do you want?
- Look.

214
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:27,982
Xiao Hong!

215
00:33:31,455 --> 00:33:32,629
- I hate you!
- I hate you too!

216
00:33:32,629 --> 00:33:34,629
- You shouldn't have...
- Why shouldn't I have?

217
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:37,493
- Let me go!
- I won't let you go!

218
00:33:37,577 --> 00:33:40,219
- I'm going anyway!
- Ok, if you go, make sure you never come back!

219
00:33:40,849 --> 00:33:43,255
Let go! Let go...

220
00:35:04,442 --> 00:35:06,256
What are you doing?

221
00:35:07,044 --> 00:35:08,740
Put that down. You can't drink anymore!

222
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:10,895
Just let me be.

223
00:35:11,093 --> 00:35:13,629
I'm too upset now. Just let me be.

224
00:35:14,484 --> 00:35:18,427
No way. You're not much of a drinker.
You've drunk too much.

225
00:35:18,729 --> 00:35:20,898
Put it down!
Do you hear me?

226
00:35:21,253 --> 00:35:22,304
Chen...

227
00:35:22,974 --> 00:35:26,615
Let me be!
If you don't want to drink then don't.

228
00:35:27,627 --> 00:35:29,217
Leave me alone. You...

229
00:35:29,638 --> 00:35:32,398
Look at yourself.
You're already drunk.

230
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,191
Come here.

231
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:43,255
Come here.

232
00:35:46,554 --> 00:35:49,209
Xiao Hong, there's a customer calling.
Why aren't you coming?

233
00:35:49,774 --> 00:35:51,209
Come here!

234
00:35:51,627 --> 00:35:53,209
Are you ignoring us? You...

Chen...

236
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:58,238
I told her to come down,
so why won't she come down?

237
00:35:58,317 --> 00:36:00,722
- Chen!
- I just want her to come down.

238
00:36:03,193 --> 00:36:05,796
- I want you to come down and sing.
- Chen!

239
00:36:06,348 --> 00:36:07,754
Oh, right, right, right.

240
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,763
Xiao Hong, the guest asked you to
come down and sing. Didn't you hear?

241
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,837
What do you want sung?

242
00:36:19,688 --> 00:36:22,265
How about "Sing-song Girl at the Ends of the Earth"?

243
00:36:26,457 --> 00:36:28,718
Come down and sing. Quickly!

He's upset.
It's nothing to do with you.

256
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,355
I'm sorry.

257
00:39:22,758 --> 00:39:24,924
- No need to see me out
- That's OK

- Go back in
- Go back in, I'll escort him out

Please come in!

There's something I want to talk
about with you, but it's awkward.

But since I just had some wine,
so I don't care if I make a fool of myself.

265
00:40:08,363 --> 00:40:12,820
Since you've shown me so much respect,
here's a little money for you to go shopping

266
00:40:13,015 --> 00:40:15,013
- Stay a while, sit down.
- No hurry.

267
00:40:15,782 --> 00:40:19,387
I need to go to the Carefree Palace.

268

- You stay.
- OK

269
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,668
Sister, what can we do?

270
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:13,221
Ask him?

271
00:41:17,636 --> 00:41:19,159
I don't want to.

272
00:41:24,552 --> 00:41:26,411
No, I don't want to.

have time to look us up.

that piece of pretty fabric?

00:43:32,453 --> 00:43:37,804
OK, OK, Xiao Hong, I'm sorry.
Xiao Hong, forgive me.

OK, OK, Xiao Hong. Don't cry,
Xiao Hong, don't cry.

You don't hate me, do you Xiao Hong?

288
00:44:34,768 --> 00:44:36,528
I hate you.

289
00:44:36,528 --> 00:44:41,125
If my sister hadn't made me come,
I would have never come to see you again.

290

Your sister?

291
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,179
Was it your sister who sent you over here?

292
00:44:50,696 --> 00:44:59,345
That man who took me to buy fabric and out
to eat that time, he came to our place again today.

293
00:45:00,225 --> 00:45:04,794
He was talking about me in mom's room.
I heard everything they said.

294
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:10,467
I also saw him give some money to ma.
They're selling me for sure.

295
00:45:10,872 --> 00:45:12,451
- He gave her money?
- Money?

296
00:45:13,121 --> 00:45:16,586
Don't worry, Xiao Hong.
There's still time to figure out a way out.

297
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:19,003
Come on, come here.

298
00:45:19,912 --> 00:45:22,874
Sit down here.
We'll help you think up a solution, OK.

299
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:27,638
But now will you treat me a little better?

300
00:45:28,672 --> 00:45:31,481
Give me a smile...give me a smile...

301
00:45:31,481 --> 00:45:33,073

306

I'm not too sure about the details either.

308
00:46:08,674 --> 00:46:10,435
That makes it harder.

It's about a, a neighbor.

342
00:50:54,081 --> 00:50:58,832
I'm sorry, but according our practice, we charge
five ounces of silver for an hour of consultation, 

343
00:50:58,832 --> 00:51:01,221
fifteen for a legal document,

344
00:51:01,221 --> 00:51:03,820
one hundred to arrange for a hearing in court,

345
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:06,321
and five hundred for an appearance
in court to represent a case.

346
00:51:06,321 --> 00:51:08,500
I think perhaps you need to reconsider.

347
00:51:22,193 --> 00:51:24,275
Five hundred ounces of silver?

348
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:29,263
- How much money is five hundred ounces of silver?
- Damn, it costs money to bring a lawsuit!

349
00:51:30,311 --> 00:51:32,546
I hadn't thought of that.

350
00:51:32,546 --> 00:51:34,546
Five hundred ounces of silver.

351
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:41,544
Damn, it costs money to bring a lawsuit!

352
00:51:42,075 --> 00:51:43,822
I've never heard of this before.

353
00:51:45,289 --> 00:51:47,161
So what do we do now?

354
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:52,219
Don't panic. We'll think of something eventually.

355
00:51:52,345 --> 00:51:54,441
<i>Escaped Criminal Apprehended</i>

356
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:05,129
Hey. What about this idea?

357
00:52:09,475 --> 00:52:11,011
Xiao Hong

358
00:52:14,043 --> 00:52:16,251
- No, no, that's not a good way.

359
00:52:16,251 --> 00:52:19,129
Silly, you have us, so what are you worried about?

360
00:52:19,129 --> 00:52:23,223
- And we have lots of friends willing to help out.
- That's right. We have lots of 'brothers-in-arms.' 

361
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:28,365
Quick. You go back first, and a little later, we'll
help you escape across the 'bridge' across the alley.

362
00:52:28,365 --> 00:52:29,888
OK, go back.

363
00:52:35,616 --> 00:52:37,628
It's no good. This plan is no good.

364
00:52:41,862 --> 00:52:46,738
Don't worry. If anything goes wrong,
we can find our 'brothers' to help us out.

365
00:52:46,738 --> 00:52:49,029
They'll help us out for sure.

366
00:53:11,455 --> 00:53:13,089
Escaping...

367
00:53:14,137 --> 00:53:16,191
...means she'll be living together with me!

368
00:55:25,167 --> 00:55:27,487
Don't cry.

369
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:29,487
Go along with them.

370
00:55:30,295 --> 00:55:33,676
They're all good people.
They'll never treat you bad.

371
00:55:34,794 --> 00:55:36,904
But what about you, sister?

372
00:55:37,994 --> 00:55:39,894
Me?

373
00:55:39,894 --> 00:55:43,331
They all dislike me.
They look down on me.

374
00:55:43,946 --> 00:55:45,455
I know.

375
00:55:46,992 --> 00:55:49,646
Why don't you come with us?

376
00:55:53,111 --> 00:55:54,578
No.

377
00:56:37,294 --> 00:56:41,095
You're the one who's always out playing cards
and now you want to blame me?

378
00:56:41,095 --> 00:56:44,144
Do you really want a man to
take care of domestic affairs?

379
00:56:44,144 --> 00:56:49,217
Don't put on airs with me. Your
ambitions don't make us any money.

380
00:56:49,217 --> 00:56:52,525
When I gamble, it's with my own money.

381
00:56:52,525 --> 00:56:57,650
And you're the one who's been teaching that girl
to sing and taking her around to the wine houses.

382
00:56:58,156 --> 00:57:00,193
She's your responsibility!

383
00:57:00,868 --> 00:57:03,151
Fine, fine, let's not waste our
breath on this anymore.

384
00:57:17,591 --> 00:57:19,447
Are you thinking about moving over to my side?

385
00:57:19,447 --> 00:57:24,013
Our place is better, you know. We face
south and the rooms are bigger.

386
00:57:31,019 --> 00:57:36,417
It's strange but last night those
two scoundrels moved out on the sly.

387
00:57:36,417 --> 00:57:41,035
No conscience, them. But that
trumpet player is a nice man!

388
00:57:42,891 --> 00:57:46,342
What trumpet player? I've never seen him.

389
00:57:46,342 --> 00:57:51,493
Don't pay any attention to that. You ought to
be asking Xiao Yun about this. She must know.

390
00:57:51,895 --> 00:57:54,697
Otherwise why would she
want to go across the lane.

391
00:57:55,177 --> 00:57:58,109
Ask her. You'll see if I'm right or not.

392
00:57:58,109 --> 00:58:00,109
Cheap slut!

393
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,792
No wonder you...Stop right there!

394
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:06,724
Where do you think
you're going? Get in here!

395
00:58:10,759 --> 00:58:12,705
Then I'll be off to tell Old Gu...

396
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,009
Close the door!

397
00:58:22,488 --> 00:58:24,018
Come here!

398
00:58:25,516 --> 00:58:28,144
If you don't tell me the truth,
I'll kill you right here and now.

399
00:58:29,649 --> 00:58:31,388
Take off your clothes.

400
00:58:32,867 --> 00:58:34,229
Did you hear me?

401
00:58:36,058 --> 00:58:37,940
Take off all your clothes.

402
00:58:40,924 --> 00:58:42,156
Quicker!

403
00:58:56,791 --> 00:59:00,631
Old Gu, would you like to eat a snack after
your bath or have something to eat now?

404
00:59:00,631 --> 00:59:02,396
Hungry again, huh?

405
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,960
- Is Mr. Gu here?
- He's here. Just arrived.

406
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,490
Mr. Gu. So you're here.

407
00:59:13,229 --> 00:59:16,693
I've been looking all over for you.
It's terrible!

408
00:59:19,846 --> 00:59:26,722
That little girl of mine, Xiao Hong.
Last night, she suddenly ran away.

409
00:59:26,722 --> 00:59:28,435
She ran away?

410
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:45,054
- Is it almost done?
- Just about, almost done.

411
00:59:45,054 --> 00:59:48,493
- Forget it! I can't stand sitting here anymore!
- But I'm almost finished.

412
00:59:57,743 --> 01:00:02,154
Xiao Hong, look what I bought you.
I know you'll like it, look!

413
01:00:03,283 --> 01:00:06,033
Give it to me! Don't curl my hair!

414
01:00:11,919 --> 01:00:15,427
- When did you get this? Why didn't you tell me?
- I've been carrying it for the last few days.

415
01:00:17,801 --> 01:00:21,200
Wang, how come you're always
pasting newspaper on the wall?

416
01:00:22,069 --> 01:00:24,422
This broken down old wall,
I can't stand looking at it.

417
01:00:25,183 --> 01:00:27,908
What do you think we
should give to Xiao Hong?

418
01:00:28,933 --> 01:00:31,060
I think, I think I'll give her a comb.

419
01:00:31,073 --> 01:00:33,876
- What about us?
- I hadn't thought of that.

420
01:00:34,615 --> 01:00:36,847
Xiao Hong, here's a comb for you.

421
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:39,714
- I don't want this broken old comb.
- Hey, why don't you give her your earring instead.

422
01:00:39,792 --> 01:00:41,582
- OK
- I don't want this earring.

423
01:00:41,582 --> 01:00:43,723
But it's not intended for your ears.
Put out your hand.

424
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:47,615
This is our engagement ring!

425
01:00:47,824 --> 01:00:49,389
Congratulations!

426
01:00:49,451 --> 01:00:51,558
Quick, let's have a wedding celebration!

427
01:00:57,793 --> 01:01:01,354
Hey, it's not done yet. Why don't you drink it all.

428
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:06,000
You...come on, drink up!

429
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:13,442
- Xiao Hong, you drink more too!
- Oh. But I'm dizzy...

430
01:01:13,442 --> 01:01:17,656
No matter. Who'll drink for Xiao Hong? Who?

431
01:01:17,866 --> 01:01:19,656
Old Wang, why don't you have a drink for her?

432
01:01:20,441 --> 01:01:23,312
Well, why do you sit there
and not say anything?

433
01:01:23,411 --> 01:01:27,169
- I've already drank a lot.
- That's right. Old Wang is so happy tonight.

434
01:01:27,169 --> 01:01:30,435
I've never seen him drink
as much wine as he has tonight.

435
01:01:30,829 --> 01:01:33,700
- Let's all be happy!
- I...

436
01:01:34,205 --> 01:01:38,382
- OK, enough already.
- Don't stop him. Everyone's so happy tonight...

437
01:01:38,382 --> 01:01:40,382
Let him finish his sentence.

438
01:01:44,112 --> 01:01:46,564
I...uh...want Xiao Hong to...

439
01:01:46,564 --> 01:01:48,598
...sing a song.

440
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:51,715
That's the best thing you've said in your life!

441
01:01:52,171 --> 01:01:54,290
Xiao Hong, go on, sing.

442
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:56,003
No, I'm dizzy. I don't want to sing.

443
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:59,749
- You must sing. I'll go get my instrument.
- Slow down. Do a magic trick for me then I'll sing.

444
01:02:00,144 --> 01:02:02,423
Good idea, bravo!

445
01:01:30,829 --> 01:01:32,332
<i>Make way! Make way! Let me sit here.</i>

446
01:02:07,118 --> 01:02:08,708
<i>Good.</i>

447
01:02:21,658 --> 01:02:24,591
This is the real stuff, no fooling around.

448
01:02:24,628 --> 01:02:26,131
Here's another one.

449
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:30,148
It goes in this eye, it comes out from here.
Now, go in!

450
01:02:32,527 --> 01:02:34,720
Is that the real stuff or fooling around?

451
01:02:36,815 --> 01:02:39,291
That one was called 'Silver Flying Away'

452
01:02:39,291 --> 01:02:41,291
Do another one! Do another one!

453
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:43,456
OK, I'll do another one.

454
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:50,110
What's that one called?

455
01:02:50,776 --> 01:02:54,645
- That was called 'Silver...'
- I know, I know, I saw this in the paper.

456
01:02:57,430 --> 01:02:59,845
<i>Massive exports of silver last month</i>

457
01:03:02,667 --> 01:03:04,749
It's called 'silver coming out of the mouth'

458
01:03:05,636 --> 01:03:06,795
Correct.

459
01:03:07,399 --> 01:03:12,722
"Massive export of silver!" Hey, get your <i>Daily News</i>,
hey, get your <i>Shanghai News</i>...

460
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:37,342
There's no business.
What am I supposed to do?

461
01:03:39,350 --> 01:03:41,383
We don't care if you don't have any business

462
01:03:41,383 --> 01:03:43,383
You still ought to give us what you owe.

463
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:46,004
If you don't pay, how will my children eat?

464
01:03:46,867 --> 01:03:48,604
Look, I even pawned my earring.

465
01:04:08,209 --> 01:04:10,772
We could certainly feed another mouth.

466
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:14,333
Xiao Hong misses you a lot.

467
01:04:15,627 --> 01:04:17,340
Why don't you run away too?

468
01:04:19,718 --> 01:04:21,788
I think you should run away too.

469
01:04:24,499 --> 01:04:26,631
I don't understand you.

470
01:05:42,794 --> 01:05:46,750
And when night came and it was
so quiet you couldn't hear a sound...

471
01:05:47,034 --> 01:05:49,769
except the wind outside the windows sighing.

472
01:05:53,219 --> 01:05:57,471
The room candle light flickered.

473
01:05:57,471 --> 01:05:59,344
It was just then that...

474
01:05:59,344 --> 01:06:01,344
the ghost came downstairs...

475
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:04,211
All you could hear from the stairwell
was a series of thumps.

476
01:06:16,065 --> 01:06:17,716
Sister!

477
01:06:24,937 --> 01:06:27,734
Did they send you here?

478
01:06:35,744 --> 01:06:37,715
Sister, here's some cool water.

479
01:06:50,309 --> 01:06:52,637
- Chen, how could you...
- Shut up!

480
01:06:52,637 --> 01:06:54,313
- She wasn't...
- Shut up!

481
01:06:54,313 --> 01:06:58,515
I don't care why she's here, but she shouldn't
come sneaking over here in the middle of the night.

482
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:00,515
She shouldn't be sneaking
over here where we live.

483
01:07:00,515 --> 01:07:03,235
How did she know we live here anyway.
Who told her?

484
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:06,118
You must have told her.

485
01:07:11,626 --> 01:07:13,955
Does this woman live here?

486
01:07:16,506 --> 01:07:18,625
<i>Does this woman live here?</i>

487
01:07:20,572 --> 01:07:22,162
Yes.

488
01:07:22,162 --> 01:07:24,162
I wasn't asking you!

489
01:07:26,228 --> 01:07:27,682
<i>What do you say?</i>

490
01:07:35,433 --> 01:07:37,121
Yes.

491
01:07:52,043 --> 01:07:56,048
Sister, I'm going to go cook some rice.
They should be coming home soon.

492
01:08:14,396 --> 01:08:19,509
Oh? You're home already?
Look, my new dress is finished.

493
01:08:19,509 --> 01:08:21,509
Oh. It's pretty. Very nice.

494
01:08:21,509 --> 01:08:23,509
What? You're going upstairs?

495
01:08:25,111 --> 01:08:28,559
Oh, well, the wall up there is broken,
so I wanted to cover it up with newspapers.

496
01:08:28,559 --> 01:08:30,559
- Do we have any paste?
- Yes.

497
01:08:47,558 --> 01:08:49,549
I bought you some medicine.

498
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:53,713
From now on, you don't have to live
the kind of life you've been living.

499
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,788
Xiao Hong!

500
01:09:27,781 --> 01:09:29,616
I can do that trick too.

501
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:42,070
I made up a new trick.
Do you want me to show it to you?

502
01:09:49,773 --> 01:09:53,118
This cup if full of red wine...

503
01:09:54,341 --> 01:09:56,904
...and that one is full of green wine.

504
01:09:56,904 --> 01:09:59,429
How about your rent?

505
01:09:59,429 --> 01:10:03,554
Oh, right. I still have a dollar on me,
why don't you take that?

506
01:10:04,426 --> 01:10:07,952
- One dollar isn't enough.
- Well, then, I'll give you more tomorrow.

507
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:10,022
OK.

508
01:10:33,835 --> 01:10:36,321
Did you get their rent?

509
01:10:36,321 --> 01:10:38,897
Yeah, he gave me one foreign dollar.

510
01:10:38,897 --> 01:10:41,305
Foreign dollar? Idiot! 

511
01:10:41,305 --> 01:10:43,231
What were you thinking, taking a foreign dollar?

512
01:10:43,894 --> 01:10:47,239
- Foreign dollars aren't any good anymore.
- Foreign dollars aren't any good?

513
01:10:47,239 --> 01:10:50,219
Your crazy. Foreign dollars aren't any good?
You must be joking.

514
01:10:50,219 --> 01:10:53,706
You don't get it. From today forward, anyone
who uses foreign dollars could be prosecuted.

515
01:10:53,706 --> 01:10:56,257
- Prosecuted?
- Give it to me. I'll give it back to him.

516
01:11:10,688 --> 01:11:13,759
Mr. Chen, can you exchange
this for a paper bill?

517
01:11:13,759 --> 01:11:16,518
What for? It's not as if
foreign dollars are made of bronze.

518
01:11:16,518 --> 01:11:20,643
No, foreign dollars aren't any good anymore.
Didn't you hear about it?

519
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:23,805
No good anymore? You're joking.
Then give it back to me.

520
01:11:23,805 --> 01:11:26,044
- Do you have paper money?
- No.

521
01:11:28,191 --> 01:11:29,414
OK.

522
01:11:45,537 --> 01:11:47,879
My hands are killing me, I can't move.

523
01:11:47,879 --> 01:11:49,879
I need to cook the rice.

524
01:11:49,879 --> 01:11:54,412
Don't worry. I'll make the rice appear in the glass.

525
01:11:54,412 --> 01:11:57,912
- I don't believe it.
- You don't believe it? Then close your eyes.

526
01:12:22,611 --> 01:12:24,615
What was that noise?

527
01:12:28,805 --> 01:12:30,588
It was the landlord.

528
01:12:32,215 --> 01:12:34,635
He says, he says foreign dollars
aren't any good anymore.

529
01:12:35,754 --> 01:12:37,485
Foreign money no good?

530
01:12:38,448 --> 01:12:39,749
Foreign money...

531
01:12:42,417 --> 01:12:44,759
How did you get upstairs?

532
01:12:44,759 --> 01:12:46,347
Why are you home so early?

533
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:48,347
I...

534
01:12:57,135 --> 01:12:59,464
Damn! Does That must mean
rents are going up again?

535
01:12:59,464 --> 01:13:02,405
- Who was that talking?
- That was the boss of the barber shop next door.

536
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:04,604
I was just looking for you.

537
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,870
What about your rent?
Are you planning to pay or not?

538
01:13:09,276 --> 01:13:11,228
- Who are you?
- I am the rent collection agent.

539
01:13:11,228 --> 01:13:14,052
- It used to be someone else.
- There's been a change in management.

540
01:13:14,052 --> 01:13:16,862
I'll be the collector from now on.

541
01:13:16,862 --> 01:13:20,467
You must pay the three months of rent
that you owe within three days.

542
01:13:20,467 --> 01:13:22,601
If not, we'll request that you vacate.

543
01:13:23,304 --> 01:13:24,917
Within three days?

544
01:13:34,131 --> 01:13:36,720
- Damn
- Boss, what's the problem?

545
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,737
Why such a temper this time?

546
01:13:38,893 --> 01:13:42,576
OK, OK. You'll have to hurry up and find
jobs elsewhere. We're closing up shop here!

547
01:13:42,576 --> 01:13:44,576
Closing? Closing?

548
01:13:46,532 --> 01:13:48,315
- Closing?
- Closing?

549
01:13:50,410 --> 01:13:51,945
Closing.

550
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:55,290
Don't. Don't cry.

551
01:14:13,625 --> 01:14:14,783
Take this.

552
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:17,997
I have a way to prevent your
boss from having to close.

553
01:14:17,997 --> 01:14:19,715
You two come with me!

554
01:14:50,959 --> 01:14:53,523
Hey! Quick, come on in!
Big sale going on here!

555
01:14:54,226 --> 01:14:57,180
Quick, come on in!
Big sale going on here!

556
01:15:07,902 --> 01:15:10,245
Hey! Two heads shaved for the price of one!

557
01:15:10,245 --> 01:15:12,860
Hey! Shave a big head
and get a small one free!

558
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:45,380
Let me through. let me through.

559
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:49,258
Here's one with hair!

560
01:15:51,327 --> 01:15:53,305
<i>Let me through.</i>

561
01:15:58,718 --> 01:16:02,310
Come on inside! Sit down!

562
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:13,423
<i>It's very inexpensive.</i>

563
01:16:14,503 --> 01:16:16,624
<i>I didn't come by to have my head shaved!</i>

564
01:16:16,663 --> 01:16:18,797
I came to see the boss,
not get my head shaved!

565
01:16:18,797 --> 01:16:21,387
Big sale, very inexpensive!

566
01:16:23,586 --> 01:16:25,525
Bastards! Let me go!

567
01:16:26,085 --> 01:16:29,572
Don't talk. Don't talk. Big sale today.

568
01:16:30,041 --> 01:16:31,914
It's very cheap.

569
01:16:32,175 --> 01:16:33,775
Bastards!

570
01:16:35,051 --> 01:16:36,625
<i>You'll be done soon.</i>

571
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:38,850
The way they shave people
is just like catching a pig.

572
01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:40,425
<i>We'll be done in a moment.</i>

573
01:16:41,661 --> 01:16:45,279
Don't worry. With us three
shaving, you'll be done in a flash.

574
01:16:46,073 --> 01:16:51,733
<i>Help! Help...</i>

575
01:16:56,184 --> 01:16:58,006
Bastards!

576
01:16:58,006 --> 01:17:00,283
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

577
01:17:04,889 --> 01:17:08,013
Damn...Damn.

578
01:17:09,249 --> 01:17:10,537
I'm sorry!

579
01:17:25,827 --> 01:17:26,894
<i>Damn</i>

580
01:17:41,898 --> 01:17:44,653
Damn...Damn.

581
01:17:44,872 --> 01:17:46,603
<i>For Rent</i>

582
01:18:15,381 --> 01:18:17,970
I've already found out where they live!

583
01:18:19,688 --> 01:18:23,384
So have you seen that girl inside?

584
01:18:24,334 --> 01:18:28,641
I haven't seen her exactly, but she has to be there. 

585
01:18:29,123 --> 01:18:34,497
It couldn't have been a coincidence
that the day she disappeared

586
01:18:34,497 --> 01:18:37,698
that little devil moved out too.

587
01:18:38,596 --> 01:18:43,112
Moreover, I noticed a long time
how that devil and Xiao Hong

588
01:18:43,112 --> 01:18:45,480
sometimes carried on...

589
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:48,486
Mr Gu, what do you think we should do?

590
01:18:50,061 --> 01:18:52,793
Just say the word and we'll take care of it.

591
01:18:55,916 --> 01:18:58,740
OK, let's go have a look tomorrow.

592
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:00,887
Damn.

593
01:19:27,759 --> 01:19:31,312
What should we do? Those two
haven't come back yet either.

594
01:19:55,997 --> 01:19:58,067
I've finally found you out! 

595
01:20:03,441 --> 01:20:06,655
I'm asking you, where is Xiao Hong.
Tell me!

596
01:20:07,969 --> 01:20:09,609
Tell me!

597
01:20:10,884 --> 01:20:13,214
Quick. Tell me!

598
01:20:15,881 --> 01:20:17,703
Cheap slut!

599
01:20:20,436 --> 01:20:22,193
Hold on a second. Put that down.

600
01:20:26,617 --> 01:20:30,118
You want to kill me huh?

601
01:20:32,044 --> 01:20:34,750
Well, I'll kill you first!

602
01:20:43,248 --> 01:20:45,525
Tell me, where is she?

603
01:20:47,568 --> 01:20:49,676
Right. We should go up and have a look.

604
01:20:50,769 --> 01:20:52,578
Keep an eye on her, Old Gu.

605
01:21:23,094 --> 01:21:24,564
Old Gu!

606
01:21:25,371 --> 01:21:27,349
She must have escaped that way.

607
01:21:27,817 --> 01:21:29,349
Cheap slut!

608
01:21:34,233 --> 01:21:37,018
Old Gu...Old Gu!

609
01:21:41,039 --> 01:21:42,743
Old Gu?

610
01:21:51,371 --> 01:21:53,973
Old Gu! Could it be that he's
setting us up to take the fall?

611
01:22:04,657 --> 01:22:07,052
Think about it. Am I right or am I wrong?

612
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:14,088
- Don't try to stop me!
- Don't do it!

613
01:22:14,088 --> 01:22:15,601
- Why not?
- What are you going for?

614
01:22:15,601 --> 01:22:17,861
- I'm going to fight.
- Is it worth it?

615
01:22:17,861 --> 01:22:21,269
- What do you mean by that?
- Is it worth fighting for that kind of woman?

616
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:24,641
- What are you saying?
- Is it worth fighting for that kind of woman?

617
01:22:36,889 --> 01:22:38,547
Old Wang

618
01:22:40,279 --> 01:22:42,393
I'm sorry.

619
01:22:48,007 --> 01:22:49,246
Chen!

620
01:22:52,144 --> 01:22:54,240
Chen, where do you think you're going?

621
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:57,503
I'll...I'll go find her for you.

622
01:22:59,398 --> 01:23:01,585
Calm down!

623
01:23:01,585 --> 01:23:03,608
This isn't some kind of game.

624
01:23:14,416 --> 01:23:16,877
Xiao Yun! Xiao Yun!

625
01:23:27,612 --> 01:23:30,346
Are you injured? Xiao Yun!

626
01:23:35,285 --> 01:23:37,144
Quickly!

627
01:23:42,102 --> 01:23:43,687
Old Wang is back!

628
01:23:51,032 --> 01:23:54,495
Quick! You all look after her
and I'll go find a doctor.

629
01:23:54,495 --> 01:23:56,495
Ah! Sister!

630
01:24:15,291 --> 01:24:16,877
Xiao Yun.

631
01:25:42,393 --> 01:25:44,252
I'm sorry.

632
01:25:48,736 --> 01:25:52,946
We all share the same miserable fate.

633
01:25:52,946 --> 01:25:57,029
What does forgiveness mean anyway?

634
01:25:57,029 --> 01:25:58,669
Sister!

635
01:26:02,351 --> 01:26:04,866
Don't be sad, Xiao Yun.

636
01:26:04,866 --> 01:26:06,866
Rest easy.

637
01:26:07,272 --> 01:26:09,714
Wang has already gone
to get you a doctor.

638
01:26:10,188 --> 01:26:12,339
A doctor?

639
01:26:14,070 --> 01:26:15,783
Old Wang?

640
01:26:17,059 --> 01:26:20,540
Old Wang is a real friend...

641
01:26:22,837 --> 01:26:25,042
Old Wang... 

642
01:26:26,318 --> 01:26:29,034
Is that him coming back?

643
01:26:35,577 --> 01:26:40,170
No, that's not him. That's just
the policeman on the night beat.

644
01:26:40,170 --> 01:26:44,234
- Old Wang will be back any moment now.
- Police?

645
01:26:45,437 --> 01:26:48,298
Police? What's he coming here for?

646
01:26:50,230 --> 01:26:52,837
To arrest people?

647
01:26:52,837 --> 01:26:55,425
To arrest me?

648
01:26:55,425 --> 01:26:57,557
To arrest him?

649
01:26:58,851 --> 01:27:00,601
- Arrest him! ... Arrest him!
- Xiao Yun

650
01:27:04,939 --> 01:27:07,399
- Xiao Yun.
- Let him go.

651
01:27:07,399 --> 01:27:09,399
- Xiao Yun
- Let him go.

652
01:27:11,701 --> 01:27:14,380
It's OK, nothing is happening, Xiao Yun.

653
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:16,380
Your eyes are playing
tricks on you, Xiao Yun.

654
01:27:22,071 --> 01:27:23,985
Release him.

655
01:27:24,969 --> 01:27:26,865
Release him.

656
01:27:28,013 --> 01:27:30,054
He's a good man.

657
01:27:32,132 --> 01:27:34,811
He helps poor people.

658
01:27:47,496 --> 01:27:49,520
Ants.

659
01:27:51,287 --> 01:27:53,055
Ants.

660
01:28:09,422 --> 01:28:11,810
Sister!

661
01:28:41,391 --> 01:28:43,104
She's gone to sleep.

662
01:29:03,116 --> 01:29:05,212
Are you tired?

663
01:29:08,566 --> 01:29:12,831
Not enough money. The doctor won't come.
