IS THAT DESIGNED TO HURT ME ?
WHAT A WASTE.

OVER WHO COMES NEXT,

01:04:07,507 --> 01:04:12,011
THAT WAS NOT AN EASY QUESTION
FROM ME, AND I DON'T DESERVE
AND EASY ANSWER.

794
01:04:13,513 --> 01:04:19,018
THERE ARE TIMES
I THINK WE LOVED
NONE OF OUR CHILDREN.

795
01:04:19,018 --> 01:04:22,021
STILL TOO EASY,
DON'T YOU THINK ?

796
01:04:22,021 --> 01:04:25,525
I'M WEARY, AND YOU WANT
A SIMPLE ANSWER,

797
01:04:25,525 --> 01:04:28,027
AND I HAVEN'T ONE.

798
01:04:28,027 --> 01:04:31,531
I'M SO SICK
OF ALL OF YOU.

799
01:04:32,031 --> 01:04:34,534
I THOUGHT I'D COME
AND GLOAT A LITTLE.

800
01:04:34,534 --> 01:04:37,537
MOTHER'S TIRED.
COME STICK PINS
TOMORROW MORNING.

801
01:04:37,537 --> 01:04:39,539
I'LL BE
MORE RESPONSIVE THEN.

802
01:04:39,539 --> 01:04:43,042
IT'S NO FUN
GOADING ANYONE TONIGHT.
BASTARD'S BOXED US UP.

803
01:04:43,543 --> 01:04:47,046
WHAT'S THAT, DEAR ?
WE'RE HIS PRISONERS,
IF THAT INTERESTS YOU.

804
01:04:47,046 --> 01:04:49,549
WHY SHOULD IT ?
I'M HIS PRISONER ANYWAY ?

805
01:04:50,049 --> 01:04:52,051
IT WAS-- CORRECT ME
IF I'M WRONG--

806
01:04:52,051 --> 01:04:55,054
BUT IT WAS MY IMPRESSION
THAT YOU WANTED
HENRY'S THRONE FOR ME.

807
01:04:55,555 --> 01:04:59,058
WE CAN'T WIN, RICHARD.
WE'VE LOST IT THIS TIME.

808
01:04:59,058 --> 01:05:01,561
YOU THINK I'M FINISHED,
DO YOU ?
SO I DO.

809
01:05:01,561 --> 01:05:04,063
I'VE SUFFERED MORE DEFEATS
THAN YOU HAVE TEETH.

810
01:05:04,564 --> 01:05:06,566
I KNOW ONE
WHEN IT HAPPENS TO ME.

811
01:05:06,566 --> 01:05:10,069
TAKE YOUR WORMWOOD
LIKE A GOOD BOY.
SWALLOW IT AND GO TO BED.

812
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:13,072
I WILL BE KING.
SO YOU WILL,
BUT NOT THIS YEAR !

813
01:05:13,072 --> 01:05:17,076
OH, LEAVE IT, RICHARD !
LET IT GO FOR NOW.

814
01:05:17,577 --> 01:05:19,579
I CAN'T.
IT'S NOT SO HARD.

815
01:05:19,579 --> 01:05:23,082
TRY SAYING AFTER ME:
JOHN WINS, I LOSE.

816
01:05:24,584 --> 01:05:26,586
AND WHAT IF JOHN DIED ?

817
01:05:26,953 --> 01:05:29,088
YOU WOULDN'T DARE !
A KNIFE.
WHY WOULDN'T I ?

818
01:05:29,372 --> 01:05:31,591
HE'S GOT A KNIFE !
OF COURSE HE HAS A KNIFE.
HE ALWAYS HAS A KNIFE.

819
01:05:31,757 --> 01:05:35,094
WE ALL HAVE KNIVES.
IT'S 1183,
AND WE'RE BARBARIANS.

820
01:05:35,094 --> 01:05:40,600
HOW CLEAR WE MAKE IT.
OH, MY PIGLETS, WE ARE
THE ORIGINS OF WAR.

821
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:44,103
NOT HISTORY'S FORCES,
NOR THE TIMES, NOR JUSTICE,
NOR THE LACK OF IT,

822
01:05:44,103 --> 01:05:47,106
NOR CAUSES, NOR RELIGIONS,
 NOR IDEAS,

823
01:05:47,106 --> 01:05:50,059
NOR KINDS OF GOVERNMENT,
 NOR ANY OTHER THING.

824
01:05:50,142 --> 01:05:53,613
WEARE THE KILLERS.
 WEBREED WARS.

825
01:05:53,613 --> 01:05:56,115
WE CARRY IT,
LIKE SYPHILIS, INSIDE.

826
01:05:56,115 --> 01:05:59,619
DEAD BODIES ROT
IN FIELD AND STREAM BECAUSE
THE LIVING ONES ARE ROTTEN.

827
01:05:59,819 --> 01:06:02,622
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD,
CAN'T WE LOVE ONE ANOTHER
JUST A LITTLE ?

828
01:06:03,122 --> 01:06:05,625
THAT'S HOW PEACE BEGINS.

829
01:06:06,626 --> 01:06:10,129
WE HAVE SO MUCH
TO LOVE EACH OTHER FOR.

830
01:06:10,129 --> 01:06:13,132
WE HAVE SUCH POSSIBILITIES,
MY CHILDREN.

831
01:06:13,633 --> 01:06:15,134
WE COULD CHANGE THE WORLD.

832
01:06:15,635 --> 01:06:18,137
AND WHILE WE HUGGED EACH OTHER,
WHAT WOULD PHILIP DO ?

833
01:06:18,337 --> 01:06:21,140
OH, GOOD GOD, PHILIP !

834
01:06:21,507 --> 01:06:24,644
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO START A WAR.
IF FATHER FINDS OUT,
I'LL BE RUINED.

835
01:06:24,644 --> 01:06:28,097
STEADY, JOHN.
DON'T PANIC.
SOME ADVISER YOU ARE.

836
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:31,150
DON'T DO ANYTHING WITHOUT ME.
LET ME HANDLE IT.
HE'S MADE A PACT WITH PHILIP.

837
01:06:31,651 --> 01:06:33,653
YOU ADVISED JOHN
INTO MAKING WAR.
THAT FEARLESS BOY--

838
01:06:33,653 --> 01:06:35,655
HE'S DISINHERITED HIMSELF.

839
01:06:35,655 --> 01:06:38,658
WHEN HENRY FINDS OUT--
WHEN I TELL HIM
WHAT JOHN'S DONE--

840
01:06:38,741 --> 01:06:42,161
I NEED A LITTLE TIME.
CAN YOU KEEP JOHN FROM
PHILIP TILL I SAY SO ?

841
01:06:42,161 --> 01:06:45,164
ANYTHING YOU SAY.
RICHARD, I WANT YOU OUT
OF HERE BEFORE THIS BREAKS.

842
01:06:45,164 --> 01:06:47,166
AND THAT MEANS PHILIP.
GO TO HIM, BE DESPERATE.

843
01:06:47,166 --> 01:06:49,168
PROMISE ANYTHING--
THE VEXIN, BRITTANY.

844
01:06:49,168 --> 01:06:52,672
ONCE YOU'RE FREE
AND JOHN IS OUT OF FAVOR,
WE'LL MAKE FURTHER PLANS.

845
01:06:52,672 --> 01:06:56,676
YOU SEE PHILIP.
YOU'RE THE DIPLOMAT.
YOU SEE HIM, YOU TALK TO HIM.

846
01:06:56,676 --> 01:06:59,178
YOU'RE A FRIEND.
YOU KNOW HIM, I DON'T.

847
01:07:02,682 --> 01:07:04,684
AND RICHARD !

848
01:07:05,685 --> 01:07:08,688
PROMISE ANYTHING.

849
01:07:14,226 --> 01:07:16,696
[ Chuckles ]
I'VE GOT THE OLD BOY
THIS TIME.

850
01:07:16,696 --> 01:07:19,699
THE DAMN FOOL
THINKS HE LOVES JOHN.
HE BELIEVES IT.

851
01:07:19,699 --> 01:07:22,201
THAT'S WHERE THE KNIFE
GOES IN--

852
01:07:26,205 --> 01:07:28,207
KNIVES.

853
01:07:29,709 --> 01:07:31,711
KNIVES.

854
01:07:34,213 --> 01:07:37,216
WHERE IS THAT MIRROR ?
I'M ELEANOR, AND I CAN
LOOK AT ANYTHING.

855
01:07:39,719 --> 01:07:42,722
MY, WHAT A LOVELY GIRL.

856
01:07:42,722 --> 01:07:46,225
HOW COULD HER KING
HAVE LEFT HER ?

857
01:08:00,572 --> 01:08:02,574
PHILIP ?

858
01:08:03,074 --> 01:08:05,577
PHILIP !

859
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:10,081
IT'S WORKING OUT.
BY MORNING, I CAN BE
THE CHOSEN SON.

860
01:08:10,081 --> 01:08:15,086
THE CROWN CAN COME TO ME.
ARE YOU STILL WITH ME ?
WE'LL HAVE TO FIGHT THEM ALL.

861
01:08:15,086 --> 01:08:17,088
THEY'LL BAND TOGETHER
ONCE THIS HAPPENS.
HAVE I GOT YOUR WORD ?

862
01:08:17,589 --> 01:08:20,592
DO I HAVE YOURS ?
ALL ENGLAND'S LAND IN FRANCE
IF I SUPPORT YOU ?

863
01:08:20,592 --> 01:08:25,096
ARE WE ALLIES THEN ?
WE WERE BORN TO BE.

864
01:08:25,096 --> 01:08:27,599
I SHOULD SAY SOMETHING SOLEMN,
BUT I HAVEN'T THE TIME.

865
01:08:27,599 --> 01:08:30,602
I'M OFF TO FATHER WITH NEWS
THAT JOHN'S A TRAITOR.
AFTER THAT--

866
01:08:30,768 --> 01:08:35,073
YOU STINK !  YOU KNOW THAT ?
YOU'RE A STINKER, AND YOU STINK.

867
01:08:36,190 --> 01:08:38,610
I'LL KILL YOU !
AH !

868
01:08:38,826 --> 01:08:40,111
LUMP.

869
01:08:40,578 --> 01:08:44,082
IF YOU'RE A PRINCE,
THERE'S HOPE FOR EVERY APE
IN AFRICA.

870
01:08:44,165 --> 01:08:47,118
I HAD YOU SAVED.
I WASN'T ON MY WAY TO FATHER,
BUT HE WAS.

871
01:08:47,585 --> 01:08:50,622
HE WOULD HAVE GONE TO HENRY
AND BETRAYED YOU.
LOOK, IT'S IN HIS FACE.

872
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:54,626
IT'S TRUE.  I DON'T KNOW
WHO MY FRIENDS ARE.

873
01:08:54,626 --> 01:08:58,630
[ Knocking ]
[ Richard ]
PHILIP ?

874
01:08:58,630 --> 01:09:00,632
PHILIP ?

875
01:09:01,633 --> 01:09:04,636
MAY WE ?
THAT'S WHAT
TAPESTRIES ARE FOR.

876
01:09:06,137 --> 01:09:08,640
I'LL NEVER LEARN.
 I'LL RUIN EVERYTHING.

877
01:09:14,646 --> 01:09:18,149
RICHARD ?
HELLO, RICHARD.

878
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:22,153
YOU'RE HALFWAY TO BED.
I'LL WAIT FOR MORNING.
COME IN.

879
01:09:22,153 --> 01:09:25,156
MOTHER SENT ME.
COME IN ANYWAY.

880
01:09:32,163 --> 01:09:34,666
OUR ALCHEMISTS HAVE STUMBLED
ON THE ART OF BOILING BURGUNDY.

881
01:09:35,166 --> 01:09:39,671
IT TURNS TO STEAM,
AND WHEN IT COOLS,
WE CALL IT BRANDYWINE.

882
01:09:39,671 --> 01:09:43,174
I'M HENRY'S PRISONER.
YOU FIND THAT CHARMING ?

883
01:09:43,675 --> 01:09:45,677
NO.
THEN WHY
THE CHARMING SMILE ?

884
01:09:45,677 --> 01:09:47,679
I THOUGHT,
 I CAN'T THINK WHY,

885
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:49,681
OF WHEN YOU WERE
IN PARIS LAST.

886
01:09:50,181 --> 01:09:53,184
CAN IT BE
TWO WHOLE YEARS AGO ?
IT CAN.  I NEED AN ARMY.

887
01:09:53,184 --> 01:09:55,186
IT'LL TAKE THE COLD AWAY.
I MUST HAVE SOLDIERS.

888
01:09:55,186 --> 01:09:58,690
HAVE I AGED ?
DO I SEEM OLDER TO YOU ?

889
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:02,694
THEY'VE BEEN TWO FIERCE YEARS.
I'VE STUDIED, AND I'VE TRAINED
TO BE A KING.

890
01:10:03,194 --> 01:10:07,198
I'LL HAVE YOUR ANSWER--
YES OR NO ?
YOU'LL HAVE IT WHEN I GIVE IT.

891
01:10:07,198 --> 01:10:09,200
YOU SEE ?
I'VE CHANGED.

892
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:12,704
I'M NOT THE BOY YOU TAUGHT
TO HUNT TWO YEARS AGO.
REMEMBER ?

893
01:10:12,704 --> 01:10:15,206
RACING AFTER BOAR,
YOU FLYING FIRST,

894
01:10:15,707 --> 01:10:19,711
ME SCRAMBLING AFTER,
ALL DAY INTO DUSK.

895
01:10:19,711 --> 01:10:23,715
DON'T GO.
I MUST KNOW.
WILL YOU HELP ME ?

896
01:10:23,715 --> 01:10:26,684
SIT AND WE'LL DISCUSS IT.

897
01:10:36,728 --> 01:10:39,230
YOU NEVER WRITE.
TO ANYONE.

898
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:41,733
WHY SHOULD I MAKE YOU
KING OF ENGLAND ?

899
01:10:42,233 --> 01:10:44,702
AREN'T I BETTER OFF
WITH JOHN OR GEOFFREY ?

900
01:10:44,786 --> 01:10:47,739
WHY HAVE YOU TO FIGHT
WHEN I COULD HAVE
THE CRETIN OR THE FIEND ?

901
01:10:47,739 --> 01:10:51,242
WOULD WE FIGHT ?
WE'RE FIGHTING NOW.
GOOD NIGHT.

902
01:10:53,211 --> 01:10:55,747
YOU'RE STILL A BOY.

903
01:10:55,963 --> 01:10:59,250
IN SOME WAYS.
WHICH WAY DID YOU HAVE IN MIND ?

904
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:03,755
YOU HAVEN'T ASKED
HOW MUCH YOUR HELP IS WORTH.
YOU'LL TELL ME.

905
01:11:03,755 --> 01:11:05,757
YOU CAN HAVE THE VEXIN BACK.
AND WHAT ELSE ?

906
01:11:05,757 --> 01:11:08,226
ALL OF BRITTANY.
DOES THAT MATTER ?
THAT'S GEOFFREY'S.

907
01:11:08,309 --> 01:11:11,262
POSSIBLY TO GEOFFREY.
AND WHAT ELSE ?
THAT'S ALL YOUR HELP IS WORTH.

908
01:11:11,262 --> 01:11:13,264
AND IN RETURN,
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME ?

909
01:11:13,347 --> 01:11:15,266
TWO THOUSAND SOLDIERS.

910
01:11:15,516 --> 01:11:17,268
- AND WHAT ELSE ?
- FIVE HUNDRED KNIGHTS ON HORSE.

911
01:11:17,735 --> 01:11:19,771
- AND WHAT ELSE ?
- ARMS AND SIEGE EQUIPMENT.

912
01:11:19,937 --> 01:11:24,275
- AND WHAT ELSE ?
- I NEVER WROTE BECAUSE
  I THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER ANSWER.

913
01:11:28,279 --> 01:11:30,782
YOU GOT MARRIED.

914
01:11:30,782 --> 01:11:34,786
DOES THAT MAKE
A DIFFERENCE ?
DOESN'T IT ?

915
01:11:37,288 --> 01:11:41,292
I'VE SPENT TWO YEARS
ON EVERY STREET IN HELL.

916
01:11:45,296 --> 01:11:47,799
THAT'S ODD.
I NEVER SAW YOU THERE.

917
01:12:14,325 --> 01:12:16,327
YOU HAVEN'T SAID
 YOU LOVED ME.

918
01:12:23,835 --> 01:12:25,837
WHEN THE TIME COMES.

919
01:12:34,345 --> 01:12:37,849
[ Knocking ]

920
01:12:40,685 --> 01:12:42,353
SHH.

921
01:12:45,356 --> 01:12:46,858
[ Knocking ]

922
01:12:57,869 --> 01:12:59,871
IT'S NOT TOO LATE
AT NIGHT ?

923
01:13:01,372 --> 01:13:04,375
I'D HOPED YOU'D COME.
GOOD !

924
01:13:04,709 --> 01:13:07,879
WE COULDN'T LEAVE NEGOTIATIONS
WHERE THEY WERE.

925
01:13:10,882 --> 01:13:13,885
AH !

926
01:13:13,885 --> 01:13:17,388
I KEEP LOOKING
FOR YOUR FATHER IN YOU.
HE'S NOT THERE.

927
01:13:17,388 --> 01:13:19,891
I'LL MISS HIM.

928
01:13:20,391 --> 01:13:22,393
HAS RICHARD OR THE QUEEN
BEEN HERE TO SEE YOU ?

929
01:13:22,894 --> 01:13:26,397
DOES IT MATTER ?
IF THEY HAVEN'T YET,
THEY WILL.

930
01:13:26,864 --> 01:13:30,902
I WANT TO REACH A SETTLEMENT.
I LEFT YOU WITH
TOO LITTLE EARLIER.

931
01:13:30,902 --> 01:13:33,404
YES.
NOTHING IS TOO LITTLE.

932
01:13:33,404 --> 01:13:35,907
I'M SORRY
YOU'RE NOT FONDER OF ME, LAD.

933
01:13:35,907 --> 01:13:39,410
YOUR FATHER ALWAYS SAID,
"BE FOND OF STRONGER MEN."

934
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:41,412
NO WONDER
HE LOVED EVERYONE.

935
01:13:42,914 --> 01:13:46,417
I'VE COME TO YOU
TO OFFER PEACE.

936
01:13:46,834 --> 01:13:49,921
PISS ON YOUR PEACE.

937
01:13:50,338 --> 01:13:53,424
YOUR FATHER WOULD HAVE WEPT.

938
01:13:53,641 --> 01:13:55,927
MY FATHER WAS A WEEPER.

939
01:13:57,929 --> 01:13:59,931
FIGHT ME, AND YOU'LL LOSE.

940
01:14:00,348 --> 01:14:02,934
I CAN'T LOSE, HENRY.

941
01:14:03,434 --> 01:14:06,437
I HAVE TIME.
WHY, JUST LOOK AT YOU.

942
01:14:06,854 --> 01:14:10,441
GREAT HEAVY ARMS.
BUT EACH YEAR THEY GET
A LITTLE HEAVIER.

943
01:14:10,441 --> 01:14:14,445
THE SAND GOES PIT-PAT
IN THE GLASS.

944
01:14:14,445 --> 01:14:18,950
I'M IN NO HURRY, HENRY.
I'VE GOT TIME.

945
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:22,954
SUPPOSE I HURRY THINGS ALONG.
SUPPOSE I SAY THAT ENGLAND
IS AT WAR WITH FRANCE.

946
01:14:22,954 --> 01:14:27,458
THEN FRANCE SURRENDERS.
I DON'T HAVE TO FIGHT
TO WIN.

947
01:14:27,959 --> 01:14:31,963
TAKE ALL YOU WANT--
THIS COUNTY, THAT ONE.
YOU WON'T KEEP IT LONG.

948
01:14:32,964 --> 01:14:35,933
WHAT KIND OF COURAGE
HAVE YOU GOT ?

949
01:14:36,968 --> 01:14:38,970
THE TIDAL KIND--

950
01:14:41,472 --> 01:14:43,975
IT COMES AND GOES.

951
01:14:44,475 --> 01:14:47,979
BY GOD, I'D LOVE TO
TURN YOU LOOSE ON ELEANOR.
MORE BRANDYWINE ?

952
01:14:47,979 --> 01:14:52,984
YOU RECOGNIZE IT ?
THEY WERE BOILING IT IN IRELAND
BEFORE THE SNAKES LEFT.

953
01:14:52,984 --> 01:14:57,989
WELL, THINGS LOOK A LITTLE BLEAK
FOR HENRY, DON'T THEY ?

954
01:14:57,989 --> 01:15:02,994
YOU'LL SAY YES TO RICHARD
WHEN HE COMES-- ARMS, SOLDIERS,
ANYTHING HE ASKS.

955
01:15:02,994 --> 01:15:04,996
I'D BE FOOLISH NOT TO.
YEAH.

956
01:15:05,496 --> 01:15:10,001
AND WITHDRAW IT ALL
BEFORE THE BATTLE EVER STARTED.
WOULDN'T YOU, IN MY PLACE ?

957
01:15:10,335 --> 01:15:12,837
WHY FIGHT HENRY WHEN HIS SONS
WILL DO IT FOR YOU ?

958
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:15,340
YES, EXACTLY.

959
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:19,844
- YOU'VE GOT PROMISE, LAD.
  THAT'S FIRST-CLASS THINKING.
-THANK YOU, SIR.

960
01:15:33,358 --> 01:15:37,362
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT ?  YOU'RE GOING ?
WE HAVEN'T SETTLED ANYTHING.

961
01:15:37,612 --> 01:15:40,865
WE OPEN CHRISTMAS PRESENTS
AT NOON.  TILL THEN.
YOU CAN'T BE FINISHED WITH ME.

962
01:15:41,366 --> 01:15:44,369
OH, BUT I AM.
IT'S BEEN MOST SATISFACTORY.
WHAT'S SO SATISFACTORY ?

963
01:15:44,369 --> 01:15:49,374
WINNING IS.
I DID JUST WIN.
SURELY YOU NOTICED.

964
01:15:49,791 --> 01:15:54,379
NOT A THING.
YOU HAVEN'T WON
A DAMN THING.

965
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:58,383
HMM.
[ Sighs ]

966
01:15:58,383 --> 01:16:02,887
I FOUND OUT
THE WAY YOUR MIND WORKS
AND THE KIND OF MAN YOU ARE.

967
01:16:02,887 --> 01:16:04,889
I KNOW YOUR PLANS
AND EXPECTATIONS.

968
01:16:04,889 --> 01:16:06,891
YOU'VE BURBLED EVERY BIT
OF STRATEGY YOU'VE GOT.

969
01:16:06,891 --> 01:16:09,394
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU WILL DO
AND EXACTLY WHAT YOU WON'T.

970
01:16:09,394 --> 01:16:11,396
AND I'VE TOLD YOU
EXACTLY NOTHING !

971
01:16:11,396 --> 01:16:15,900
TO THESE AGED EYES, BOY,
THAT'S WHAT WINNING LOOKS LIKE !
DORMEZ BIEN.

972
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:17,902
YOU--

973
01:16:20,154 --> 01:16:23,408
YOU MADE MY FATHER NOTHING.

974
01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:27,412
YOU WERE ALWAYS BETTER.

975
01:16:28,913 --> 01:16:30,915
YOU BULLIED HIM,

976
01:16:31,416 --> 01:16:33,918
YOU BELLIED WITH HIS WIFE,

977
01:16:33,918 --> 01:16:36,421
YOU BEAT HIM DOWN
IN EVERY WAR,

978
01:16:36,421 --> 01:16:38,923
YOU TWISTED EVERY TREATY,

979
01:16:38,923 --> 01:16:41,926
YOU PLAYED MOCK THE MONK,

980
01:16:42,427 --> 01:16:45,930
AND THEN YOU MADE HIM
LOVE YOU FOR IT.

981
01:16:45,930 --> 01:16:48,433
I WAS THERE.

982
01:16:48,433 --> 01:16:51,936
HIS LAST WORDS
WENT TO YOU.

983
01:16:51,936 --> 01:16:54,439
HE WAS A LOVING MAN, AND YOU'VE
LEARNED NOTHING OF IT.

984
01:16:54,939 --> 01:16:59,944
I LEARNED HOW MUCH FATHERS
LIVE IN SONS.

985
01:16:59,944 --> 01:17:03,448
A KING LIKE YOU HAS POLICY
PREPARED ON EVERYTHING.

986
01:17:04,949 --> 01:17:07,952
WHAT'S THE OFFICIAL LINE
ON SODOMY ?

987
01:17:08,085 --> 01:17:12,957
HOW STANDS THE CROWN
ON BOYS WHO DO WITH BOYS ?

988
01:17:17,962 --> 01:17:20,965
RICHARD FINDS HIS WAY
INTO SO MANY LEGENDS.

989
01:17:20,965 --> 01:17:23,468
LET'S HEAR YOURS
AND SEE HOW IT COMPARES.

990
01:17:23,468 --> 01:17:25,970
HE FOUND ME FIRST
WHEN I WAS 15.

991
01:17:25,970 --> 01:17:27,972
WE WERE HUNTING.
IT WAS NEARLY DARK.

992
01:17:27,972 --> 01:17:31,476
MY HORSE FELL,
I WAS THROWN.

993
01:17:31,476 --> 01:17:33,978
I WOKE TO RICHARD
TOUCHING ME.

994
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:37,482
HE ASKED ME
IF I LOVED HIM.

995
01:17:37,698 --> 01:17:41,986
"PHILIP, DO YOU LOVE ME ?"

996
01:17:43,488 --> 01:17:45,990
AND I TOLD HIM, "YES."

997
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:49,460
DO YOU KNOW WHY
I TOLD HIM YES ?

998
01:17:50,495 --> 01:17:54,999
SO THAT ONE DAY I COULD
TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT.

999
01:17:54,999 --> 01:17:58,503
YOU CANNOT IMAGINE
WHAT THAT "YES" COST.

1000
01:17:58,503 --> 01:18:03,508
IMAGINE SNUGGLING
TO A CHANCRED WHORE...

1001
01:18:03,508 --> 01:18:07,512
AND BENDING BACK YOUR LIPS
INTO SOMETHING LIKE A SMILE,
SAYING,

1002
01:18:07,512 --> 01:18:09,514
"YES,

1003
01:18:11,015 --> 01:18:14,519
"I LOVE YOU,

1004
01:18:15,019 --> 01:18:18,022
"AND I FIND YOU...

1005
01:18:18,022 --> 01:18:20,024
BEAUTIFUL."

1006
01:18:23,027 --> 01:18:25,029
I DON'T KNOW HOW I DID IT.

1007
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:30,034
- NO !  IT WASN'T LIKE THAT !
- BUT IT WAS.

1008
01:18:32,537 --> 01:18:35,039
YOU LOVED ME.

1009
01:18:41,546 --> 01:18:43,548
NEVER.

1010
01:18:53,057 --> 01:18:56,060
GET OUT.  PLEASE.

1011
01:18:56,310 --> 01:18:58,062
I DON'T WANT YOU HERE.

1012
01:18:58,563 --> 01:19:01,065
IT'S NO GREAT PLEASURE
TO BE HERE.

1013
01:19:01,065 --> 01:19:04,068
SO THE ROYAL CORKSCREW
FINDS ME TWISTED, DOES HE ?

1014
01:19:04,068 --> 01:19:07,572
I'LL GO TELL YOUR MOTHER.
SHE'LL BE PLEASED.
SHE KNOWS.  SHE SENT ME.

1015
01:19:07,572 --> 01:19:10,575
HOW COMPLETELY HERS YOU ARE.

1016
01:19:10,575 --> 01:19:14,078
YOU'VE HAD FOUR SONS.
WHO DO YOU CLAIM ?

1017
01:19:14,078 --> 01:19:16,080
NOT HENRY.
 NOT MY BURIED BROTHER.

1018
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:20,084
NOT THAT MONUMENT TO MUCK,
THAT EPIC IDIOT.

1019
01:19:20,084 --> 01:19:23,588
WHY HIM ?
WHY ALWAYS HIM
AND NEVER ME ?

1020
01:19:23,588 --> 01:19:25,590
HE WAS THE ELDEST.
 HE CAME FIRST.

1021
01:19:27,592 --> 01:19:30,595
CHRIST, HENRY,
IS THAT ALL ?

1022
01:19:30,895 --> 01:19:33,097
YOU WENT WITH ELEANOR.

1023
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:37,101
YOU NEVER CALLED ME.
 YOU NEVER SAID MY NAME.

1024
01:19:38,603 --> 01:19:42,607
I'D HAVE WALKED.
I'D HAVE CRAWLED.
I'D HAVE DONE ANYTHING.

1025
01:19:44,108 --> 01:19:48,112
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.
I WON'T BE BLAMED.

1026
01:19:49,614 --> 01:19:51,616
I ONLY WANTED YOU.

1027
01:19:52,116 --> 01:19:56,120
NO, MY CROWN.
YOU WANT MY KINGDOM.
YOU KEEP YOUR KINGDOM.

1028
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:58,122
THAT I WILL.
I HOPE IT KILLS YOU.

1029
01:20:00,124 --> 01:20:04,128
THANK GOD I HAVE ANOTHER SON.
 THANK GOD FOR JOHN.

1030
01:20:04,428 --> 01:20:08,132
AND WHO SHALL WE THANK
FOR GEOFFREY ?  YOU DON'T
THINK MUCH OF ME.

1031
01:20:11,636 --> 01:20:14,639
"MUCH" ?  I DON'T THINK
OF YOU AT ALL.

1032
01:20:14,772 --> 01:20:17,642
NURSE USED TO SAY
I HAD YOUR HANDS.

1033
01:20:17,642 --> 01:20:21,145
I MIGHT HAVE HAD MORE OF YOU.
TRY SEEING ME.

1034
01:20:21,228 --> 01:20:24,649
I HAVEN'T RICHARD'S
MILITARY SKILL, BUT HE WAS
HERE BETRAYING YOU, NOT I.

1035
01:20:24,649 --> 01:20:30,655
I HAVEN'T JOHN'S--
GOD KNOWS WHAT YOU SEE IN JOHN--
AND HE'S BETRAYED YOU TOO.

1036
01:20:30,788 --> 01:20:32,657
YOU THINK I'D EVER
MAKE YOU KING ?

1037
01:20:33,157 --> 01:20:35,660
YOU'LL MAKE ME KING
BECAUSE I'M ALL YOU'VE GOT.

1038
01:20:36,043 --> 01:20:39,664
I WAS TO BE HIS CHANCELLOR.
ASK HIM WHY.
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH.

1039
01:20:40,164 --> 01:20:41,666
FOR MOVING JOHN
TO TREASON.

1040
01:20:43,167 --> 01:20:46,170
I DON'T DOUBT HE OFFERED,
 I DON'T DOUBT YOU TRIED,

1041
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:49,173
AND I DON'T DOUBT
JOHN LOVES ME.

1042
01:20:49,390 --> 01:20:51,676
LIKE A GLUTTON
LOVES HIS LUNCH.

1043
01:20:55,479 --> 01:20:57,682
YOU TURD.

1044
01:21:06,190 --> 01:21:08,192
WELL, JOHN ?

1045
01:21:09,694 --> 01:21:13,197
IT ISN'T WHAT YOU THINK.
WHAT DO I THINK ?

1046
01:21:13,197 --> 01:21:17,201
WHAT GEOFFREY SAID.
I WOULDN'T PLOT
AGAINST YOU, EVER.

1047
01:21:17,201 --> 01:21:20,204
I KNOW.
YOU'RE A GOOD BOY.

1048
01:21:20,204 --> 01:21:24,175
CAN I GO NOW, PLEASE ?
IT'S LATE.
I OUGHT TO BE IN BED.

1049
01:21:32,216 --> 01:21:36,220
COULDN'T YOU WAIT ?
COULDN'T YOU TRUST ME ?
IT WAS ALL YOURS.

1050
01:21:36,721 --> 01:21:38,723
COULDN'T YOU BELIEVE THAT ?
WILL YOU LISTEN
TO THE GRIEF ?

1051
01:21:38,723 --> 01:21:41,726
WHO DO YOU THINK
I BUILT THIS KINGDOM FOR ?
ME !

1052
01:21:42,226 --> 01:21:44,228
DADDY DID IT ALL FOR ME.

1053
01:21:44,228 --> 01:21:47,732
WHEN CAN I HAVE IT, DADDY ?
NOT UNTIL WE BURY YOU ?

1054
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:52,236
- I LOVED YOU.
- YOU'RE A COLD AND BLOODY
  BASTARD, YOU ARE.

1055
01:21:52,236 --> 01:21:55,239
AND YOU DON'T LOVE ANYTHING.

1056
01:21:58,242 --> 01:22:03,247
I'M IT.
 I'M ALL THAT'S LEFT.

1057
01:22:03,247 --> 01:22:06,250
HERE, FATHER.
 HERE I AM.

1058
01:22:22,566 --> 01:22:24,268
[ Murmurs ]

1059
01:22:28,272 --> 01:22:32,777
MY LIFE, WHEN IT IS WRITTEN,
WILL READ BETTER THAN IT LIVED.

1060
01:22:33,778 --> 01:22:37,281
HENRY FITZ-EMPRESS,
FIRST PLANTAGENET,
A KING AT 21,

1061
01:22:37,281 --> 01:22:39,784
THE ABLEST SOLDIER
OF AN ABLE TIME.

1062
01:22:41,285 --> 01:22:43,788
HE LED MEN WELL,
HE CARED FOR JUSTICE
WHEN HE COULD...

1063
01:22:43,788 --> 01:22:47,291
AND RULED, FOR 30 YEARS, A STATE
AS GREAT AS CHARLEMAGNE'S.

1064
01:22:48,793 --> 01:22:53,297
HE MARRIED OUT OF LOVE
A WOMAN OUT OF LEGEND.

1065
01:22:53,297 --> 01:22:57,802
NOT IN ALEXANDRIA
OR ROME OR CAMELOT
HAS THERE BEEN SUCH A QUEEN.

1066
01:22:59,303 --> 01:23:03,307
SHE BORE HIM MANY CHILDREN,

1067
01:23:03,307 --> 01:23:05,810
BUT NO SONS.

1068
01:23:05,943 --> 01:23:08,813
KING HENRY HAD NO SONS.

1069
01:23:10,314 --> 01:23:15,820
HE HAD THREE WHISKERED THINGS,
BUT HE DISOWNED THEM.

1070
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:20,324
YOU'RE NOT MINE !
WE'RE NOT CONNECTED !

1071
01:23:20,541 --> 01:23:23,327
I DENY YOU !

1072
01:23:23,327 --> 01:23:25,329
NONE OF YOU WILL GET MY KINGDOM.
I LEAVE YOU NOTHING !

1073
01:23:25,830 --> 01:23:30,334
AND I WISH YOU PLAGUE !
MAY ALL YOUR CHILDREN
BREECH AND DIE !

1074
01:23:37,307 --> 01:23:39,309
MY BOYS ARE GONE.

1075
01:23:44,314 --> 01:23:46,316
I'VE LOST MY BOYS.

1076
01:24:06,336 --> 01:24:08,839
YOU DARE TO DAMN ME,
DO YOU ?

1077
01:24:08,839 --> 01:24:11,341
WELL, I'LL DAMN YOU BACK.

1078
01:24:11,341 --> 01:24:14,344
GODDAMN YOU !

1079
01:24:20,851 --> 01:24:22,853
MY BOYS ARE GONE.

1080
01:24:24,855 --> 01:24:26,857
I'VE LOST MY BOYS.

1081
01:24:29,359 --> 01:24:33,363
[ Crying ]
OH, JESUS.

1082
01:24:35,866 --> 01:24:37,868
ALL MY BOYS.

1083
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:52,442
HENRY ?

1084
01:27:47,057 --> 01:27:52,562
?? THE CHRISTMAS WINE
  IS IN THE POT ??

1085
01:27:54,564 --> 01:27:59,069
?? THE CHRISTMAS COALS
  ARE RED ??

1086
01:28:00,070 --> 01:28:05,575
?? I'LL SPEND MY DAY
  THE LOVER'S WAY ??

1087
01:28:05,575 --> 01:28:09,079
?
?? UNWRAPPING ALL MY GIFTS ?

1088
01:28:09,079 --> 01:28:12,082
?? IN BED ??

1089
01:28:14,084 --> 01:28:17,087
?? THE CHRISTMAS MASS ??

1090
01:28:17,087 --> 01:28:20,090
?
?? IS OVER NOW ?

1091
01:28:20,090 --> 01:28:25,595
?? THE CHRISTMAS PRAYERS
  ARE DONE ????

1092
01:28:28,598 --> 01:28:32,602
NO ONE ELSE IS CAROLING.
IT MIGHT AS WELL BE LENT.

1093
01:28:32,602 --> 01:28:37,107
WHEN I WAS LITTLE,
CHRISTMAS WAS A TIME
OF GREAT CONFUSION TO ME.

1094
01:28:37,107 --> 01:28:40,610
THE HOLY LAND HAD TWO KINGS--
GOD AND UNCLE RAYMOND.

1095
01:28:41,111 --> 01:28:44,114
I NEVER KNEW WHOSE BIRTHDAY
WE WERE CELEBRATING.

1096
01:28:44,114 --> 01:28:47,117
HENRY ISN'T HERE.
GOOD, WE CAN TALK
BEHIND HIS BACK.

1097
01:28:47,617 --> 01:28:49,619
WHAT HAPPENED ?
DON'T YOU KNOW ?

1098
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:53,623
THERE WAS A SCENE
WITH BEDS AND TAPESTRIES,
AND MANY THINGS GOT SAID.

1099
01:28:54,124 --> 01:28:56,126
SPICED WINE.

1100
01:28:56,126 --> 01:29:00,130
I'D FORGOTTEN HENRY LIKED IT.
MAY I STAY ?

1101
01:29:00,130 --> 01:29:03,633
IT'S YOUR ROOM
JUST AS MUCH AS MINE.
WE'RE BOTH IN RESIDENCE.

1102
01:29:03,633 --> 01:29:06,136
PACKED IN LIKE THE POOR,
THREE TO A BED.

1103
01:29:07,637 --> 01:29:09,639
DID YOU LOVE HENRY--
EVER ?

1104
01:29:09,639 --> 01:29:14,144
EVER ?
BACK BEFORE THE FLOOD ?
AS LONG AGO AS ROSAMUND.

1105
01:29:14,144 --> 01:29:18,648
AH, THAT'S PREHISTORY, LAMB.
THERE ARE NO WRITTEN RECORDS
OR SURVIVORS.

1106
01:29:18,648 --> 01:29:22,152
THERE ARE PICTURES.
SHE WAS PRETTIER THAN YOU.
OH, MUCH.

1107
01:29:22,152 --> 01:29:26,156
HER EYES,
IN CERTAIN LIGHT, WERE VIOLET,
AND ALL HER TEETH WERE EVEN.

1108
01:29:26,156 --> 01:29:28,158
THAT'S A RARE, FAIR FEATURE--
EVEN TEETH.

1109
01:29:28,158 --> 01:29:32,662
SHE SMILED TO EXCESS,
BUT SHE CHEWED
WITH REAL DISTINCTION.

1110
01:29:32,662 --> 01:29:34,664
AND YOU HATE HER
EVEN NOW.

1111
01:29:34,664 --> 01:29:37,167
NO, BUT I DID.

1112
01:29:37,167 --> 01:29:42,172
HE PUT HER IN MY PLACE, YOU SEE,
AND THAT WAS VERY HARD.

1113
01:29:42,172 --> 01:29:47,677
LIKE YOU,
SHE HEADED HENRY'S TABLE.
THAT'S MY CHAIR.

1114
01:29:49,179 --> 01:29:52,182
AND SO
YOU HAD HER POISONED.

1115
01:29:52,182 --> 01:29:54,184
NO, I NEVER POISONED ROSAMUND.

1116
01:29:54,184 --> 01:29:56,186
[ Chuckles ]
OH, I PRAYED FOR HER TO DROP...

1117
01:29:56,686 --> 01:30:00,190
AND SMILED A LITTLE
WHEN SHE DID.

1118
01:30:00,190 --> 01:30:02,692
WHY AREN'T YOU HAPPY ?

1119
01:30:02,692 --> 01:30:07,197
HENRY'S KEEPING YOU.
YOU MUST BE CLEVERER
THAN I AM.

1120
01:30:07,197 --> 01:30:09,199
I'VE TRIED FEELING PITY
FOR YOU,

1121
01:30:09,199 --> 01:30:11,701
BUT IT KEEPS ON TURNING
INTO SOMETHING ELSE.

1122
01:30:12,202 --> 01:30:14,204
WHY PITY ?

1123
01:30:14,204 --> 01:30:18,708
YOU LOVE HENRY,
BUT YOU LOVE
HIS KINGDOM TOO.

1124
01:30:18,708 --> 01:30:21,211
YOU LOOK AT HIM,
AND YOU SEE CITIES,

ACREAGE, COASTLINE,
TAXES.

1126
01:30:25,215 --> 01:30:27,717
ALL I SEE IS HENRY.

1127
01:30:29,219 --> 01:30:31,721
LEAVE HIM TO ME,
CAN'T YOU ?

1128
01:30:33,223 --> 01:30:35,725
I LEFT HIM YEARS AGO.

1129
01:30:37,227 --> 01:30:39,729
AND I THOUGHT
I COULD MOVE YOU.

1130
01:30:39,729 --> 01:30:42,232
WERE YOU ALWAYS
LIKE THIS ?

1131
01:30:42,232 --> 01:30:45,235
WHEN I WAS YOUNG
AND WORSHIPPED YOU,
IS THIS WHAT YOU WERE LIKE ?

1132

ANYTHING HE ASKS FOR.

DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I SHOULD LIKE
FOR CHRISTMAS ?

1135

I SHOULD LIKE
TO SEE YOU SUFFER.

WHAT EYES THE WISE MEN
MUST HAVE HAD TO SEE
A NEW ONE IN SO MANY.

1143
01:31:47,297 --> 01:31:50,800
YOU LOOK COLD.
I'VE MULLED
SOME WINE.

1144
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:53,803
I WONDER--
WERE THERE FEWER STARS THEN ?

THERE'S A MYSTERY IN IT.

WARM WINE.

FOR LOVING NEVER STOPS.

I WON'T HAVE IT TO BE
THAT SIMPLE.

OF ALL THE LIES,
THAT ONE IS THE MOST TERRIBLE.

 I SAVED IT UP FOR NOW.

EVERYTHING WE'VE TOUCHED.

1258

DOWN TO THE HOUR
AND COLOR OF YOUR STOCKINGS.

1259
01:39:45,975 --> 01:39:49,479
I COULD HARDLY SEE YOU
FOR THE SUNLIGHT.

1260

IT WAS RAINING,
BUT NO MATTER.

1261
01:39:56,486 --> 01:40:00,490
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALK,
AS I RECALL.

1262
01:40:00,490 --> 01:40:02,992
VERY LITTLE.

1263
01:40:02,992 --> 01:40:06,996
I HAD NEVER SEEN
SUCH BEAUTY.

1264
01:40:06,996 --> 01:40:09,999
I WALKED RIGHT UP
AND TOUCHED IT.

1265
01:40:11,501 --> 01:40:15,004

THE GALL TO DO THAT ?
