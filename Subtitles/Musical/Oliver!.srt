Oliver's back!

1228
01:50:45,639 --> 01:50:47,015
Look at his togs!

1229
01:50:47,099 --> 01:50:48,683
He's got books, too!

1230
01:50:48,767 --> 01:50:50,351
Quite the little gent,
ain't he?

1231
01:50:50,436 --> 01:50:52,145
Lovely bit of stuff.

1232
01:50:52,229 --> 01:50:54,856
Delighted to see
you're looking
so well, my dear.

1233

The Dodger will
give you another suit,

1234
01:50:56,650 --> 01:50:58,234
for fear you should
spoil that Sunday one.

1235

Cor! Look at this!

1236
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:05,658
I'll bank it for you.

1237
01:51:05,743 --> 01:51:07,577
What's that?

1238
01:51:09,246 --> 01:51:10,788
That's mine, Fagin.

1239
01:51:10,873 --> 01:51:14,500
No, no, my dear.
Mine. Ours.

1240
01:51:14,585 --> 01:51:16,044
You shall have the books.

1241
01:51:16,128 --> 01:51:20,131
You hand it over,
you avaricious old skeleton.

1242
01:51:24,636 --> 01:51:27,138
That's for our share
of the trouble.

1243
01:51:27,222 --> 01:51:29,349
You keep the books.
Start a library.

1244
01:51:30,351 --> 01:51:33,895
Mr. Brownlow will be here after you
if he finds out you've got
his books and money.

1245
01:51:35,647 --> 01:51:38,024
So he'll be out here, will he?

1246
01:51:38,108 --> 01:51:40,568
Out here?
After us?

1247
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:46,199
What did you
tell him about us?
Nothing!

1248
01:51:46,283 --> 01:51:50,620
Fagin, I'll wager
this young rat's
told him everything.

1249
01:51:51,372 --> 01:51:52,872
What did you tell him?

1250
01:51:59,546 --> 01:52:02,715
No! Leave him alone!
You stand off me!

1251
01:52:02,841 --> 01:52:06,177
No violence!
You'll have to kill me before I let you
lay a hand on that boy.

1252
01:52:06,261 --> 01:52:09,055
Don't you tell me.
Just don't you tell me.
You keep out of this!

1253
01:52:09,139 --> 01:52:12,100
If he says he
didn't tell them,
he didn't tell them.

1254
01:52:12,184 --> 01:52:13,559
Hit me, would you?

1255
01:52:13,644 --> 01:52:16,687
I won't stand by
and see it done, Bill.
Let him be!

1256
01:52:16,772 --> 01:52:20,066
Let him be, or I'll put my mark
on you, and I don't care
for no consequences

1257
01:52:20,150 --> 01:52:22,026
Nancy, you're
wonderful tonight!

1258
01:52:23,028 --> 01:52:27,031
Such talent! Such a joker!
You take care I don't
overdo it, Fagin,

1259
01:52:27,699 --> 01:52:29,033
or I'll put the finger
on all of you,

1260
01:52:29,118 --> 01:52:31,828
and I don't care
if I hang for it!

1261
01:52:34,164 --> 01:52:37,583
Do you know who you are?
And what you are?

1262
01:52:37,668 --> 01:52:39,377
You don't have to tell me.

1263
01:52:39,503 --> 01:52:43,047
A fine one for the boy
to make a friend of.
Yes, I am, God help me!

1264
01:52:44,466 --> 01:52:48,678
And I wish I'd been struck down dead
before I laid a hand
to bring him back here.

1265
01:52:48,762 --> 01:52:52,014
From tonight he's a liar
and a thief,

1266
01:52:52,099 --> 01:52:54,517
and all that's bad.

1267
01:52:54,601 --> 01:52:57,645
Ain't that enough for you
without beating him to death?

1268
01:52:57,729 --> 01:53:03,985
Come, come, Sikes.
We must have civil words.
Civil words.

1269
01:53:04,069 --> 01:53:07,029
Oh, yes, you deserve them
from me, don't you?

1270
01:53:07,114 --> 01:53:10,074
I thieved for you
when I was half his age.

1271
01:53:10,159 --> 01:53:12,952
And it's your dirty work
I've been doing ever since.

1272
01:53:13,036 --> 01:53:14,662
Well, if you have,
it's a living, isn't it?

1273
01:53:14,746 --> 01:53:17,039
He's right, Nancy.
A living is a living.

1274
01:53:17,124 --> 01:53:19,584
Some living! Lord help me!

1275
01:53:19,668 --> 01:53:21,335
Some living!

FAGIN: Get to bed, all of you.

1277
01:53:25,215 --> 01:53:28,217
Get to bed, I said!

1278
01:53:28,302 --> 01:53:32,138
All this violence,
all these scenes,
screams, dramas!

1279
01:53:32,222 --> 01:53:35,057
I'm asking you,
is it necessary?

1280
01:53:36,810 --> 01:53:38,394
Not yet, Fagin.

1281
01:53:39,229 --> 01:53:41,147
Not yet.

1282
01:53:41,231 --> 01:53:45,651
But if this godforsaken
little good-for-nothing's
uttered one word,

1283
01:53:45,736 --> 01:53:47,320
one word, mind you...

1284
01:53:47,404 --> 01:53:49,989
If he has, the little devil,

1285
01:53:50,073 --> 01:53:52,533
we sit down,
we talk it over,
we think it out,

1286
01:53:52,618 --> 01:53:54,869
we decide upon
a proper course of safe action,

1287
01:53:54,953 --> 01:53:57,580
we stay calm!

1288
01:53:58,540 --> 01:54:00,333
Do we?

1289
01:54:00,417 --> 01:54:06,214
And while we're sitting here
thinking, and talking,
and staying calm,

1290
01:54:06,298 --> 01:54:08,549
our collars get felt, don't they?

1291
01:54:08,634 --> 01:54:11,511
And it's,
"Come along with me,
if you please."

1292
01:54:12,596 --> 01:54:14,096
No, thank you very much.

1293
01:54:14,765 --> 01:54:17,183
Look, you thought us
into this little lot.

1294
01:54:17,267 --> 01:54:20,686
You can think
your way out of it.

1295
01:54:20,771 --> 01:54:25,107
But from now on,
Bill Sikes takes the law
into his own hands.

1296
01:54:26,193 --> 01:54:28,110
These hands.

1297
01:54:29,404 --> 01:54:34,951
Have you ever heard the sound
a chicken makes when they're
wringing off its neck?

1298
01:54:37,704 --> 01:54:39,622
Can't say I ever had the...

1299
01:54:39,706 --> 01:54:41,541
They squawks, Fagin.

1300
01:54:42,668 --> 01:54:44,293
They squawks.

1301
01:54:45,128 --> 01:54:49,298
Not a very pretty sound.
No, Bill.

1302
01:54:49,383 --> 01:54:52,718
And then they dies,
don't they?

1303
01:54:53,971 --> 01:54:57,098
Yes, Bill. I mean, no, Bill.

1304
01:54:57,182 --> 01:55:02,103
Then they say some
even start squawking
before that event.

1305
01:55:02,187 --> 01:55:06,315
They get what you might call
a premonition.

1306
01:55:07,317 --> 01:55:11,362
Now, then,
you wouldn't be
having no premonition

1307
01:55:11,446 --> 01:55:13,739
of that sort by any chance,
would you?

1308
01:55:14,866 --> 01:55:18,411
Not me, Bill.
The lips are sealed.

1309
01:55:19,329 --> 01:55:21,038
I'm glad.

1310
01:55:21,123 --> 01:55:25,167
'Cause if anyone here
should lead the law to me,

1311
01:55:25,252 --> 01:55:27,878
and I gets to hear of it,

1312
01:55:27,963 --> 01:55:30,548
then it will be your neck.

1313
01:55:30,632 --> 01:55:35,469
Your scraggy old neck.

1314
01:55:43,270 --> 01:55:45,438

my dear wife decided.

Now, what have you
got to tell me?

1386
02:01:52,722 --> 02:01:55,140
This locket,
sir, once belonged
to the boy's mother.

1387
02:01:55,225 --> 02:01:57,977
Found by the wife
after she passed away.

1388
02:01:58,061 --> 02:02:00,312
The boy's mother,
that is, not my dear wife.

all these years?

1391
02:02:14,911 --> 02:02:16,328
Why should I not?

1392
02:02:16,413 --> 02:02:19,999
Did it not occur to you
that this might provide the answer
to the boy's parentage?

1393
02:02:20,083 --> 02:02:22,001
His identity? His very name?

1394
02:02:22,085 --> 02:02:24,420
But he had no name, sir.
The mother was unmarried.

1395
02:02:24,504 --> 02:02:28,340
It was your clear duty
to show this evidence
to some higher authority.

1396
02:02:28,425 --> 02:02:29,758
Your behavior, madam,
was shameful!

1397
02:02:29,843 --> 02:02:33,846
How dare you speak to me so?
I only came here to help you.

1398
02:02:33,930 --> 02:02:36,849
You came here to profit
from your own greed
and dishonesty.

1399
02:02:36,933 --> 02:02:39,476
Sir, if you think
the locket don't properly
belong to my dear wife...

1400
02:02:39,602 --> 02:02:41,270
Be quiet,
you old fool!
Here. Your reward.

1401
02:02:41,354 --> 02:02:42,855

Take it.

show these people out.

1404

There's gratitude for you!

1405
02:02:50,113 --> 02:02:52,406
I hope this unfortunate
little circumstance

1406

won't deprive me of
my parochial office?

1407
02:02:54,284 --> 02:02:56,201
My hope, sir,
is that it will.

1408

But it was all
Mrs. Bumble, sir.

1409
02:02:57,871 --> 02:02:59,371
I knew nothing of
it until yesterday.

1410
02:02:59,456 --> 02:03:01,165
That's no excuse.
In the eyes of the law,

1411
02:03:01,249 --> 02:03:02,958
you are the more
guilty of the two.

1412
02:03:03,043 --> 02:03:06,128
For the law supposes
that your wife acts
under your direction.

1413
02:03:06,212 --> 02:03:09,131
If that's what
the law supposes, sir,
then the law's an ass!

1414
02:03:09,215 --> 02:03:12,051
If that's the eye
of the law, sir,
then law is a bachelor!

1415
02:03:12,135 --> 02:03:15,971
And the worst I wish
the law is that its eye
may be opened by experience!

By experience, sir!

1417
02:03:27,984 --> 02:03:31,653
Sir, the locket,
I didn't really see...

1418
02:03:31,738 --> 02:03:37,576
I recognized it at once.
I gave it to my niece, Emily,
on her 18th birthday.

1419
02:03:37,660 --> 02:03:41,747
So it wasn'tjust her
young man jilting her
that made her run away?

1420
02:03:41,831 --> 02:03:43,916
No.

1421
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:48,337
She must have made her
way to that workhouse
and had her baby there.

1422

What's going on?

1423
02:04:26,918 --> 02:04:28,460
Why have you
brought the boy here?

1424
