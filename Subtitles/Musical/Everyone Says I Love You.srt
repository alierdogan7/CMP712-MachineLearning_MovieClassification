[Girl Narrating] That's my sister
Skylar and her boyfriend Holden.

42
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,603
And that's me.
Well, I'm Djuna. D-J-U-N-A.

43
00:03:41,671 --> 00:03:43,764
Oh, and everyone calls me D.J.

44
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,865
Now, I'm gonna level with ya.

45
00:03:45,942 --> 00:03:49,878
We are not the typical kind of family
you'd find in a musical comedy.

46
00:03:49,946 --> 00:03:51,914
For one thing, we got dough.

47
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:56,179
And we live right here on Park Avenue
in a big apartment; a penthouse.

48
00:03:56,252 --> 00:04:00,916
Dad's a lawyer. I mean, I call him
"Dad," but actually he's stepdad.

49
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:05,620
There's original Dad
who married Mom and they had me.

50
00:04:05,695 --> 00:04:09,461
And there's stepdad. Well, he had
two kids with his first wife when...

51
00:04:09,532 --> 00:04:12,524
Look, maybe this is all
getting a little confusing.

52
00:04:12,602 --> 00:04:14,729
You see, there's Lane and Laura.

53
00:04:14,804 --> 00:04:17,238
Those are my half-sisters,
and they're really great.

54
00:04:17,307 --> 00:04:20,242
A little twitty at times,
but we love each other...

55
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,801
and we have
a million laughs together.

56
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:25,814
And, of course, my stepbrother
Scott, who's very smart...

57
00:04:25,882 --> 00:04:27,975
but currently on the outs
with the family...

58
00:04:28,051 --> 00:04:30,076
because he's become
a conservative Republican...

59
00:04:30,153 --> 00:04:32,553
which has caused my stepfather
to have a stroke...

60
00:04:32,622 --> 00:04:34,556
since we're all liberal Democrats.

61
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:37,058
How can you expect
people on welfare...

62
00:04:37,126 --> 00:04:39,856
to develop any sort of incentives
if they're getting handouts?

63
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:43,831
What are you saying? Somebody who can't work
for one reason or another has to be discarded?

64
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,028
Welfare does not work. It's the same
outmoded liberal fantasy world...

65
00:04:47,103 --> 00:04:51,199
as affirmative action, not allowing
school prayer and coddling of criminals.

66
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:55,040
I can't believe I'm having this
conversation with my own flesh and blood.

67
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:59,480
Unless some large Republican pea pods are in
the basement and have taken over your body.

68
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,414
Not pods, Dad. Ideas.

69
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:03,418
Virile, modern ideas.

70
00:05:03,486 --> 00:05:06,011
A strong America.
The right to bear arms.

71
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:08,023
- Arms? What are you... Guns?
- Yes!

72
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:12,221
Are you crazy? What the hell is the matter
with you? I don't understand you anymore.

73
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:15,025
- Why... Wait a minute. Excuse me.
- Relax, Bob.

74
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:18,693
Steffi, bring down a copy
of my will and an eraser, okay?

75
00:05:18,768 --> 00:05:20,929
[D.J. Narrating]
If Dad's a liberal Democrat,

76
00:05:21,004 --> 00:05:23,996
then you'd have to say Mom
is the one thing more extreme.

77
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,064
She's a guilty liberal Democrat.

78
00:05:26,142 --> 00:05:30,010
Well, he grew up poor and he knows
what it is to work like a dog.

79
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,343
But Mom came from money and luxury...

80
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:36,511
and, you know, spends all her time
doing volunteer work for everybody.

81
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:41,182
She's with the American Civil Liberties
Union and Save the Whales...

82
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:45,091
and she raises dough for the
Whitney Museum and Lenox Hill Hospital.

83
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:47,152
She's always got something going,

84
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,564
like throwing some chic soiree
to help the New York Philharmonic.

[D.J. Narrating]
Lane and Laura go to Nightingale,

88
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:01,802
which is this ritzy school
on East 92nd Street.

89
00:07:01,871 --> 00:07:05,705
[All Chattering Simultaneously]

90
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:09,142
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God, there he is.

91
00:07:09,212 --> 00:07:11,339
- He is so gorgeous.
- Who is he?

92
00:07:11,414 --> 00:07:15,316
[Lane] We don't know, but we always
see him around this neighborhood.

93
00:07:15,384 --> 00:07:19,320
- She's in love from afar. - I'm sure we can
think of a way to get her to meet him.

94
00:07:19,388 --> 00:07:22,221
Please, no humiliating schemes.

95
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,282
[Lane Chattering]

96
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,954
You guys, my mom is
in there with a patient.

97
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:30,795
[D.J. Narrating] Claire's their best friend.
Her mom's a shrink on Central Park West.

98
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,768
Years ago, Claire drilled
a secret hole in the wall,

99
00:07:33,836 --> 00:07:38,830
and we get our kicks after school
sometimes kinda tuning in on her clientele.

100
00:07:38,908 --> 00:07:44,471
I've been having these fantasies
about... other men,

101
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,845
and, uh... you know,

102
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:49,817
it makes me feel bad and, um,

103
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,081
you know, guilty.

104
00:07:52,155 --> 00:07:56,854
Oh, I ha... Um, I had
that elevator dream... again.

105
00:07:56,926 --> 00:07:59,986
And, um, I'm in the elevator...

106
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:03,896
and... it just keeps going up...

107
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:06,696
and up and up.

108
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:09,363
[D.J. Narrating]
Now you have to meet Grandpa.

109
00:08:09,438 --> 00:08:12,464
Eighty-eight years old.

110
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:14,601
Found him at Grand Central Station.

111
00:08:14,677 --> 00:08:17,009
- He thought he was
at the Botanical Gardens. - Thanks.

112
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,547
[D.J. Narrating]
You have to keep your eye on him.

113
00:08:19,615 --> 00:08:21,913
Last year he wandered out
of the bathroom in a towel...

114
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:23,918
and got on line in Times Square.

115
00:08:23,986 --> 00:08:28,047
We had to send Frieda to get him back.
Oh, she's our maid.

116
00:08:28,124 --> 00:08:31,150
Personally, I think she was
Hitler's maid at Berchtesgaden,

117
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:33,457
but she's the only one
who can handle Grandpa.

118
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:36,123
[Frieda Speaking German]

119
00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:40,158
I found your arch supports in the stew!
Whatever were they doing in the stew?

120
00:08:40,236 --> 00:08:42,636
- Hi, Grandpa. Hi, Frieda.
- [Speaking German]

121
00:08:42,705 --> 00:08:47,108
[D.J. Narrating] Finally, there's my
dad, who lives in Paris but visits a lot.

122
00:08:47,176 --> 00:08:49,906
You see, he and my stepdad
are great friends.

123
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:54,439
And if you ask me, he still has a crush on
Mom, although they've been divorced for years.

124
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:58,146
They're all friends, though, and they
come to each other with problems.

125
00:08:58,221 --> 00:09:01,281
I can't believe it.
Giselle left me.

126
00:09:01,357 --> 00:09:05,487
Look at this face. She left me with my
best friend, suddenly, out of left field.

127
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:08,462
- She didn't give any warning?
- Nothing at all. Look at that.

128
00:09:08,531 --> 00:09:12,524
Did you ever see anything... I'm so
distraught over this, I can't tell you.

129
00:09:12,602 --> 00:09:14,536
- I'm gonna kill myself.
- [Bob] Ohhh.

130
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:17,869
I should go to Paris and jump off
the Eiffel Tower. I'll be dead.

131
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,636
In fact, if I get the Concorde,
I could be dead three hours earlier,

132
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,644
which would be perfect.

133
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:25,272
Or... Wait a minute.
With the time change,

134
00:09:25,348 --> 00:09:29,250
I could be alive for six hours in
New York, but dead three hours in Paris.

135
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:32,082
- Sit down. Relax. - I could get things
done and I could also be dead.

136
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:36,352
You didn't hear the signs.
She must've given you some signs, Joe.

137
00:09:36,425 --> 00:09:39,826
What do you think I am, an idiot? What
kind of signs you think she gave me?

138
00:09:39,895 --> 00:09:44,355
I found this photo in her underwear drawer?
She muttered his name when making love?

139
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:47,425
- I'm not talking about that.
- No, that's what happened.

140
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,233
- What? Joe! - I didn't see it.
I couldn't put it together.

141
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:53,901
I'm really glad you didn't marry her.
I told you, don't do it.

142
00:09:53,976 --> 00:09:56,877
- I would've been happy to marry her.
- I'm really glad.

143
00:09:56,946 --> 00:09:59,141
You want a glass of something?
Some wine?

144
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:02,878
I'll take anything. I gotta have
a drink. Know what the sad part is?

145
00:10:02,952 --> 00:10:08,447
- I thought everything was going well.
- You always pick the wrong women.

146
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,288
- Hey, I picked you.
- Yeah, we got divorced.

147
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,296
- 'Cause you were impossible to live with.
- I was impossible to live with?

148
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:18,197
I love this. You couldn't figure out
whether you wanted to be...

149
00:10:18,267 --> 00:10:20,360
a psychoanalyst or a writer.

150
00:10:20,436 --> 00:10:23,428
So, I compromised.
I became a writer and a patient.

151
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:26,475
We're gonna find you somebody.
We... We know a lot of people.

152
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,272
- Can't we find somebody?
- I've been trying since we got divorced...

153
00:10:29,345 --> 00:10:33,406
to find the right woman for him,
somebody to match up with his personality.

154
00:10:33,482 --> 00:10:35,916
But I'm beginning...
Honey, bring another glass.

155
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:39,853
I'm beginning to wonder if the world
population of women isn't too limited.

156
00:10:39,922 --> 00:10:41,856
- Thank you.
- Well, I mean...

00:10:41,924 --> 00:10:45,985
- You've had really bad luck. - No, he hasn't.
He's had an unerring sense of poor choice.

158
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:50,499
And the question is, does he want to spend
his golden years with somebody or not?

159
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:53,626
- What, are you into
my golden years suddenly? - Yes.

160
00:10:53,703 --> 00:10:56,672
- You have to think about those things.
- Men age differently than women.

161
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:00,732
- Two more years, I'm gonna look
like your son. - Oh, that was so mean.

162
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,675
- [Laughing]
- Don't you laugh.

163
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:06,146
Don't talk about my golden years.
She's got me in a home already.

What about Madeline?
After me.

165
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:13,115
Madeline was won... Madeline was
an archaeologist. She was fabulous.

166
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:15,123
Madeline was a nymphomaniac.

167
00:11:15,191 --> 00:11:17,819
Yeah, okay, she had
a little problem with fidelity.

168
00:11:17,893 --> 00:11:21,090
- I didn't happen to see it. But she was
a brilliant woman. - What about Carol?

169
00:11:21,163 --> 00:11:23,427
Remember Carol what's-her-name?

170
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:27,560
- Carol was a poet, and a member of MENSA.
- She was a heroin addict.

171
00:11:27,636 --> 00:11:30,571
She was also a heroin addict,
but I thought it was insulin.

172
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,097
- You know what the problem is? Listen.
- This is the problem.

173
00:11:34,176 --> 00:11:37,612
- He's still in love with you.
I've always said this. - Oh, honey.

174
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,205
Who can blame him?
Of course he is.

175
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:43,217
- Ah, come here. Come here, my two men.
- That's the problem.

176
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,651
Two men.
I'm pining after Giselle.

177
00:11:45,721 --> 00:11:47,916
We're gonna get somebody
who's nearly normal.

178
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:52,120
I don't know if we're gonna get
somebody. This is the problem.

179
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:57,164
- Hey.
- [D.J.] Hey.

180
00:11:57,233 --> 00:12:00,532
Hey. What's all the secrecy about?
Why Harry Winstons?

181
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:04,403
Listen... I want you to help me pick out
an engagement ring for Skylar.

182
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,270
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

183
00:12:06,342 --> 00:12:09,607
[Salesman] So, you're looking
for an engagement ring?

184
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:11,612
We're getting married.

185
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,978
Uh, I'm getting married.
Not to her.

186
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:17,109
Now, what size did you have in mind?

187
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:19,518
- What size?
- Uh-huh.

188
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:23,581
Oh, um... Well, she's not huge.

189
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,059
I mean, she's not bony either.
She's got flesh.

190
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:28,062
Something simple, but elegant?

191
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,622
- That's it.
- Simple, but elegant. Exactly. [Whispering]

192
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,932
- Like this one. - Oh, my God,
that's beautiful. That is beautiful.

193
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:40,169
- Look at that. - That's the mos
beautiful thing I ever saw. Hello.

194
00:12:40,242 --> 00:12:42,733
So, what is that gonna cost me?
I like it.

195
00:12:42,812 --> 00:12:46,339
- Fifty-five thousand.
- Fifty-five thousand dollars, you say?

196
00:12:46,415 --> 00:12:50,818
Uh, well, let me take
this off then because...

197
00:12:50,886 --> 00:12:54,413
I don't think that...
Actually, as I look at it, it's really...

198
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,551
To Skylar's taste, it's kind of...
tacky. She's not a mafia bride.

199
00:12:58,627 --> 00:13:01,027
- Will you help me out?
- Here's a lovely one.

200
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:03,564
- That is... That is pretty.
- Pretty simple.

201
00:13:03,632 --> 00:13:05,566
[Clears Throat]
Well, I don't...

202
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:08,159
What is that gonna cost me?
About fifteen-hundred, 2,000?

203
00:13:08,237 --> 00:13:10,797
- Eight thousand.
- Eight thousand dollars.

204
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,898
- Um...
- It's more in the ball park.

205
00:13:12,975 --> 00:13:15,273
- It's in the range.
- It's the right neighborhood.

206
00:13:15,344 --> 00:13:18,472
- Not my neighborhood, but... [Exhales]
- But it's a better neighborhood.

207
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:22,005
What the hell. Right? 'Cause
we're getting married. Let's do it.

208
00:13:22,084 --> 00:13:26,384
- It's pretty.
- I think it's an absolutely exquisite ring.

209
00:13:26,455 --> 00:13:29,549
# My baby don't care for rings #

210
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,093
# Or other expensive things #

211
00:13:32,161 --> 00:13:35,790
# My baby just cares for me #

212
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:43,566
# My baby don't go
for big Rolls-Royces #

213
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:48,770
# There's sometimes a doubt
about her choices #

214
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:52,871
# My baby don't care to own #

215
00:13:52,948 --> 00:13:56,145
# Some 14-karat stone #

216
00:13:56,218 --> 00:14:00,382
# She's sensible as can be #

217
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:06,419
# My baby don't care who knows it #

218
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,461
# My baby just cares for me #

219
00:14:14,236 --> 00:14:16,932
# He's so happy since the day #

220
00:14:17,006 --> 00:14:19,907
# He fell in love in a great big way #

221
00:14:19,975 --> 00:14:23,911
# And the big surprise
is someone loves him too #

222
00:14:26,148 --> 00:14:29,083
# It's difficult for us to see #

223
00:14:29,151 --> 00:14:32,450
# Just what she could
possibly see in he #

224
00:14:32,521 --> 00:14:37,356
# But it simply goes to prove
what love can do #

225
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:42,125
# His baby don't care for shows #

226
00:14:42,197 --> 00:14:45,189
# His baby don't care for clothes #

227
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:48,930
# My baby just cares for me #

228
00:14:49,004 --> 00:14:51,837
# Nobody else will do #

229
00:14:51,907 --> 00:14:57,470
# His baby don't care
for furs and laces #

230
00:14:57,546 --> 00:15:03,348
# His baby don't care for going
to the races or high-tone places #

231
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:06,946
- # My baby's not much for sports #
- # Gets out of sorts #

232
00:15:07,022 --> 00:15:09,752
- # Like runnin' 'round tennis courts #
- # No, no #

233
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:13,056
# I must say
I'm glad that she #

234
00:15:13,128 --> 00:15:16,222
# He's glad to say that she #

235
00:15:16,298 --> 00:15:22,203
# Has made such a fine selection #

236
00:15:22,271 --> 00:15:25,570
# My baby just cares for me #

237
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,051

00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,357
# His baby just
His baby just #

241
00:16:23,432 --> 00:16:26,526
# My baby just cares for me ##

242
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:28,968
Mrs. Holden Spence.

243
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:31,529
Skylar Spence!
I love the sound of that.

244
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:35,065
- He's taking her to Le Cirque for
dinner tonight. - Le Cirque? No kidding.

245
00:16:35,144 --> 00:16:38,307
- He's gonna propose.
- I don't wanna blow my own horn here,

246
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,814
- but I'm the one who introduced them.
- We've heard it.

247
00:16:40,883 --> 00:16:43,647
I did!
He came to work at our law firm...

248
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:46,449
The first day he was there,
I said, " This kid is great!

249
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:49,184
His feet are on the ground.
He's perfect for her."

250
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,192
Frieda, the pasta has no sauce.

251
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,287
It's Bavarian pasta! It doesn't need
any sauce! Italian pasta needs sauce.

252
00:16:55,364 --> 00:16:58,959
- The Italians were weak!
- Okay, fine. Just gimme some pepper.

253
00:16:59,034 --> 00:17:00,899
I cannot understand you!

254
00:17:00,969 --> 00:17:04,097
Your solution to rampant crime
is let criminals go free?

255
00:17:04,173 --> 00:17:07,142
- [Mother] No, Charles Ferry deserves
a parole. - What? What is this?

256
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:11,043
Are you kidding me? You want
somebody like this out on the streets?

257
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:15,072
"Armed robbery, assault, assault with
a deadly weapon, attempted escape."

258
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:17,744
- Scott, he was an abused child.
- [Dad] Have a little compassion.

259
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:21,017
He went to prison his whole entire life
because he had a horrible childhood,

260
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:23,456
which is something
you know nothing about.

261
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:25,652
- Then one mistake after the other.
- [Scott] One mistake?

262
00:17:25,728 --> 00:17:29,892
Yes. It leads to bad crime, corrupt...
I don't wanna discuss this with you.

263
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,866
- I can't listen to any of this!
- I can't stand this.

264
00:17:32,935 --> 00:17:35,028
- I need my wallet.
- Where are you going?

265
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:37,038
- Up to the Polo Grounds.
- No, no, no.

266
00:17:37,106 --> 00:17:40,473
- Giants and Cardinals are having
a doubleheader. - Pop, you can't go out.

267
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:42,874
- If you wanna take a walk, you gotta
go with Frieda. - Good idea.

268
00:17:42,945 --> 00:17:46,472
- But they're playing today. This is
Labor Day. - [Laura] It's June, Grandpa.

269
00:17:46,548 --> 00:17:49,176
- It's June.
- The Polo Grounds closed years ago.

270
00:17:49,251 --> 00:17:52,220
- Frieda, just take him for a short walk.
- Rained out?

271
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:56,246
- I'm not going with Frieda.
- All right, okay.

272
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,590
- I'm not going with her. I don't need
a German shepherd. - Take a nice walk.

273
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,289
- You know what the kids tell me?
- German shepherd. I feel so...

274
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:05,959
They think that Holden is gonna give
a little surprise to Skylar tonight.

275
00:18:06,034 --> 00:18:09,162
If you keep gossiping about it,
there's gonna be no surprise.

276
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:12,503
- Honey, please...
- I'm going out.

277
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:15,236
- Have a nice time. - If Minnie calls,
tell her I went to the Polo Grounds.

278
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,904
[Laura] Minnie's been
dead for 20 years, Grandpa.

279
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:21,711
I'm not arguing that. I'm just saying
if she calls, I'll be home later.

280
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:24,252
You know,
21 is too young to get married,

281
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:27,413
but if this was anybody but Holden,
I'd be against it.

282
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:30,788
Well, there's no way I'm getting married
'til I'm 35 and I've lived,

283
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:34,420
...and then I'll probably move in with
a woman. - Why do you make these jokes?

284
00:18:34,496 --> 00:18:36,589
- You like Holden, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

285
00:18:36,665 --> 00:18:40,328
The problem isn't Holden, it's Skylar.
She's a romantic twit.

286
00:18:40,402 --> 00:18:43,735
- Yeah. Her problem with Holden is
he's not romantic. - So what?

287
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:47,207
- She's gonna marry him, right? - [Lane]
I hope so. I want her room when she does.

288
00:18:47,276 --> 00:18:50,712
I'm serious. I don't see any reason
why he should not leap at this guy.

289
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:52,906
Skylar suffers from
"white knight" syndrome.

290
00:18:52,981 --> 00:18:55,279
Ever since her hormones kicked in,

291
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,944
she's been waiting for
some charismatic figure...

292
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,954
to come and sweep her
off her feet.

293
00:19:00,022 --> 00:19:02,684
So Holden is that young Lochinvar.

294
00:19:02,758 --> 00:19:06,660
- He's that young schnook. - He's a
schnook, but he's a loveable schnook.

295
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:10,323
- He's wonderful, and you... - What an
embarrassment. I'm never bringing a guy home.

296
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,835
- You have to listen.
- In the first place...

297
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,311
# I'm a dreamer #

298
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:35,879
# Aren't we all #

299
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:40,921
# Just a dreamer #

300
00:19:40,996 --> 00:19:45,023
# Aren't we all #

301
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,900
# In my dreams #

302
00:19:48,971 --> 00:19:53,067
# Each night it seems #

303
00:19:53,141 --> 00:19:57,305
# My sweetheart comes #

304
00:19:57,379 --> 00:20:00,780
# To call #

305
00:20:03,485 --> 00:20:06,477
# He's so charming #

306
00:20:06,555 --> 00:20:10,218
# Strong and tall #

307
00:20:12,094 --> 00:20:15,086
# It's alarming #

308
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:17,996
# How I fall #

309
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:23,196
# He's ideal #

310
00:20:23,272 --> 00:20:26,764
# But then he isn't real #

311
00:20:26,842 --> 00:20:30,778
# And I'm a fool #

312
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:36,978
# But aren't we all ##

313
00:20:45,627 --> 00:20:49,119
- I've been thinking. Can I tell
you how I see us? - How?

314
00:20:49,197 --> 00:20:51,688
[Chuckles]
Okay, well, we get married...

315
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:53,758
and we live near
my parents in Sharon.

316
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,030
Oh, I could never leave New York.

317
00:20:56,104 --> 00:20:59,631
We leave my parents in Sharon.
We'd live in New York, of course.

318
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:03,405
It's just, at some point, we may want a
little more space if we have four kids.

319
00:21:03,478 --> 00:21:06,276
I want two children.

320
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:10,216
Two kids is... Two is perfect!
Two is... Two is perfect for me.

321
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:12,378
Because four is really a lot.

322
00:21:12,454 --> 00:21:15,446
[Clears Throat] And you'll be able
to stay at home with them and...

323
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,492
No, I'll be working.

324
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:19,857
I mean, when not working full-time.

325
00:21:19,928 --> 00:21:22,260
Of course, you're gonna have
a career: journalism.

326
00:21:22,331 --> 00:21:24,925
- Architecture.
- [Sighs]

327
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,161
Architecture? Since when?

328
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:30,033
I don't know.
It's just some thoughts I've had.

329
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:32,699
Thoughts you...
You majored in journalism, but...

330
00:21:32,774 --> 00:21:35,368
[Clears Throat] The point is...
The important thing is...

331
00:21:35,444 --> 00:21:38,345
I think we agree with each other
on just about everything.

332
00:21:38,413 --> 00:21:41,940
[Clears Throat]
Shall I bring the dessert, sir?

333
00:21:42,017 --> 00:21:45,350
Oh, is... It's time for dessert.
Yes, it is.

334
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:49,254
Will you excuse me for one second?
I'll just attend to a small matter.

335
00:21:49,324 --> 00:21:52,885
- It's ready just as you wished, Mr. Spence.
- You think it's gonna work?

336
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:56,055
- Here we are, sir.
- Oh, look at... That's... That's perfect.

337
00:21:56,131 --> 00:21:59,362
- I'm glad you liked it.
- Now, let me show you my end of the deal.

338
00:21:59,434 --> 00:22:01,595
- Whoo! That's a honey, huh?
- Oh-ho. Oh, yes.

339
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,503
Look at that.
It set me back just a little bit.

340
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:08,441
It's a brilliant idea, sir.
Very romantic.

341
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,911
- Yes, well, that's the kind of guy I am.
- Oh, I can see that.

342
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,006
- I'm just gonna lay that right down there.
- [Chuckling]

343
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:18,575
- Is that gonna knock her socks off?
I think so. - Yes, sir. Shall we?

344
00:22:18,653 --> 00:22:22,089
- I'm relying on you, Umberto.
- Good luck, sir.

345
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:25,492
Is everything okay?

346
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,494
- All taken care of.
- Shall we order dessert?

347
00:22:27,562 --> 00:22:29,496
- I took the liberty.
- You did?

348
00:22:29,564 --> 00:22:33,022
I know you like a take-charge kind
of guy and I'm comin' through for you.

349
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,035
- It's not like you. [Gasps]
- Anything for you.

350
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,799
- Umberto, will you please do the honors?
- Parfait!

351
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:39,807
- Certainly, sir.
- Oh, mmm!

352
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:43,834
Oh, my God, it's delicious!
And peach, my favorite flavor.

353
00:22:43,912 --> 00:22:47,348
- It's delicious.
- What are you doing? Stop it!

354
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:49,680
- What are you doing?
- Where's the rest of the dessert?

355
00:22:49,751 --> 00:22:52,242
- What do you mean? - Where the whipped
cream and the cherry are.

356
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,413
- I ate it.
- You ate the ring?

357
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:56,957
- What ring?
- Honey, I bought you a diamond ring!

358
00:22:57,025 --> 00:22:58,959
- You did?
- I went to Harry Winston's.

359
00:22:59,027 --> 00:23:01,495
- Where is it?
- I put it in the parfait.

360
00:23:01,563 --> 00:23:03,622
- Why?
- I thought it would be romantic!

361
00:23:03,698 --> 00:23:06,633
You thought it would be romantic
to put a ring on ice cream?

362
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:09,727
- This was not my idea.
This was D.J.'s idea! - D.J.?

363
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,797
She said it would give it
dramatic flair. I don't believe this.

364
00:23:12,874 --> 00:23:14,603
I ate a diamond ring?

365
00:23:14,676 --> 00:23:18,134
I turn around for two seconds and
there's $8,000 going down your throat.

366
00:23:18,213 --> 00:23:21,307
- I swallowed a... Oh, my God!
- Take it easy. Stay calm.

367
00:23:21,383 --> 00:23:24,352
- How big was it?
- It was tasteful, believe me.

368
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:26,910
- It was a big rock.
- I swallowed a what? A karat?

369
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:29,548
- It was a karat and a half, easily.
- You'd like two carrots?

370
00:23:29,624 --> 00:23:31,558
- I'm dying!
- You're not dying!

371
00:23:31,626 --> 00:23:35,653
- Something wrong, sir? - She just swallowed
a little jewelry. It's all right.

372
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,664
- How could you?
- How could I?

373
00:23:37,732 --> 00:23:41,259
- Most people look at their food before
they lunge into it. - [Choking]

374
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:44,203
- Let me check your mouth.
- [Gagging]

375
00:23:44,272 --> 00:23:46,832
I don't think this is going
to present much of a problem.

376
00:23:46,908 --> 00:23:49,376
It's lodged in an accessible place.

377
00:23:49,444 --> 00:23:52,072
It's an absolutely beautiful ring!
A solitaire.

378
00:23:52,147 --> 00:23:54,513
A classic. A brilliant choice.
Congratulations.

379
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:57,711
Oh, congratulations, girl.
It is beautiful.

380
00:23:57,786 --> 00:24:01,051
Katie! Katie, look.
She got engaged.

381
00:24:01,123 --> 00:24:04,183
- So, uh, what is it, about two karats?
- No, a karat and a half.

382
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:06,454
- White gold?
- No, it's solid platinum.

383
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,462
- Solid?
- Harry Winston's.

384
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,464
- What'd you pay?
- Eight thousand.

385
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:14,298
I can get this same ring for you
for six from my brother-in-law.

386
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:18,135
I am so happy for you!
He is a wonderful man.

387
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,436
Yeah. Am I gonna scar?

388
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:24,741
# Doctors look at X-rays
but they seldom grin #

389
00:24:24,813 --> 00:24:28,977
# I am always on the outside
looking in #

390
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:33,316
# Maybe that is why
I see the funny side #

391
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:37,620
# When I see a fallen brother
take a bride #

392
00:24:37,692 --> 00:24:41,958
# Weddings make
a lot of people sad #

393
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,931
# But if you're not the groom #

394
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,198
# You're not so bad #

395
00:24:49,271 --> 00:24:53,332
# Another bride
Another groom #

396
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:57,276
# Another sunny honeymoon #

397
00:24:57,345 --> 00:25:01,475
# Another season
Another reason #

398
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:04,348
# For makin' whoopee #

399
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:09,823
# A lot of shoes
A lot of rice #

400
00:25:09,891 --> 00:25:14,021
# The groom is nervous
He answers twice #

401
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:17,929
# It's really killing
That he's so willing #

402
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:19,990
# To make whoopee #

403
00:25:22,671 --> 00:25:26,698
# Picture a little love nest #

404
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:30,643
# Down where the roses cling #

405
00:25:30,712 --> 00:25:34,739
# Picture the same sweet love nest #

406
00:25:34,816 --> 00:25:38,650
# Think what a year can bring #

407
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,520
# He's washing dishes
and baby clothes #

408
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:46,618
# He's so ambitious
He even sews #

409
00:25:46,695 --> 00:25:50,688
# But don't forget, folks
That's what you get, folks #

410
00:25:50,765 --> 00:25:52,528
# For makin' whoopee #

411
00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:55,035
# Just for makin' whoopee #

412
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:44,341
# He's washing dishes
and baby clothes #

413
00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:48,287
# He's so ambitious
He even sews #

414
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,654
# But don't forget, folks #

415
00:26:52,494 --> 00:26:54,826
# That's what you get, folks ##

416
00:27:10,912 --> 00:27:15,406
[D.J. Narrating] Summer came and Lane and
Laura got jobs at the Metropolitan Museum...

417
00:27:15,483 --> 00:27:17,713
and spent weekends
at the beach.

418
00:27:17,786 --> 00:27:20,084
Mom put together a group
of artists and writers...

419
00:27:20,155 --> 00:27:22,749
to petition for the parole
of Charles Ferry,

420
00:27:22,824 --> 00:27:24,758
her new pet cause.

421
00:27:24,826 --> 00:27:28,421
She even visited the prison and
was just appalled by the conditions.

422
00:27:28,496 --> 00:27:31,556
What we need are open prisons.

423
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:36,593
Space. Space where the damaged
human spirit can heal.

424
00:27:36,671 --> 00:27:39,469
I say give them an opportunity
to participate...

425
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:44,001
in decorating their own cells
with their own personal decorators.

426
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:48,277
And better cuisine.
European menus.

427
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:52,616
[D.J. Narrating] As for me, well, over the
years I was used to splitting summers up;

428
00:27:52,687 --> 00:27:56,145
July with Mom in New York
and August with Dad in Europe.

429
00:27:56,224 --> 00:27:59,887
Usually it was Paris,
but this time he took me to Venice.

430
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:03,761
Well, I think he still wanted to get
over memories of Giselle dumping him.

431
00:28:03,832 --> 00:28:07,768
Well, all I can say is, if we're
gonna talk about romantic cities...

432
00:28:07,836 --> 00:28:10,430
I mean, they've got
the most gorgeous guys there...

433
00:28:10,505 --> 00:28:12,735
and they can't keep
their hands off you.

434
00:28:12,807 --> 00:28:15,970
It's great. The whole first week
was just heaven for me.

435
00:28:16,044 --> 00:28:19,605
I was just having a ball,
sailing around on gondolas.

436
00:28:19,681 --> 00:28:22,775
But Dad, well, he just seemed
to hang around the hotel.

437
00:28:22,851 --> 00:28:25,843
Giselle was still haunting him.

438
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,253
# I'm thru with love #

439
00:28:29,324 --> 00:28:32,350
# I'll never fall again #

440
00:28:32,427 --> 00:28:36,090
# Said adieu to love #

441
00:28:36,164 --> 00:28:39,531
# Don't ever call again #

442
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:43,128
# For I must have you #

443
00:28:43,204 --> 00:28:45,365
# Or no one #

444
00:28:47,709 --> 00:28:50,234
# And so I'm thru #

445
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:53,007
# With love #

446
00:28:54,682 --> 00:28:57,810
# I've locked my heart #

447
00:28:57,886 --> 00:29:01,378
# I'll keep my feelings there #

448
00:29:01,456 --> 00:29:05,187
# I've stocked my heart #

449
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:08,696
# With icy, frigid air #

450
00:29:08,763 --> 00:29:12,164
# And I mean to fall #

451
00:29:12,233 --> 00:29:14,565
# For no one #

452
00:29:17,071 --> 00:29:21,599
# Because I'm thru with love ##

453
00:29:23,211 --> 00:29:26,544
I just feel so guilty.
I mean, I'm having all the luck.

454
00:29:26,614 --> 00:29:28,548
- You should have fun.
- I am.

455
00:29:28,616 --> 00:29:31,107
I still can't figure out
what went wrong with Giselle.

456
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,246
You know, I always thought
she was a little flighty.

457
00:29:34,322 --> 00:29:38,088
- You want a drink? I'm gonna have a beer.
- Yeah. A Bellini.

458
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,628
- Let me give you this advice.
- Mm-hmm.

459
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:45,291
In life, when a relationship breaks up
that you're in... I hope they don't...

460
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:48,733
- Thank you. - It's better
to be the leaver than the "leavee."

461
00:29:48,803 --> 00:29:53,206
'Cause the leaver leaves, but
the "leavee" is left, and it's terrible.

462
00:29:53,274 --> 00:29:57,870
The worst that happens to the leaver
is a little survivor guilt,

463
00:29:57,946 --> 00:30:01,245
and survivor guilt is the worst thing
that should ever happen to you.

464
00:30:01,316 --> 00:30:04,217
Yeah? Well, tomorrow
I'll spend with you.

465
00:30:04,285 --> 00:30:06,879
- It's not necessary, really.
- No, it's okay.

466
00:30:06,955 --> 00:30:10,550
Don't turn around. That's the couple.
Don't turn around.

467
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:14,721
- Who? - I told you about her.
I watched her check in the other day.

468
00:30:14,796 --> 00:30:18,027
She's really lovely,
but I think married.

469
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:20,659
- Isn't she...
- Oh, my God!

470
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:23,568
- She's beautiful, right?
- I know who she is.

471
00:30:23,638 --> 00:30:25,572
You're kidding?

472
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,404
Why didn't I think of it?
She's perfect for you.

473
00:30:28,476 --> 00:30:31,036
How could she be perfect for me?
She's married.

474
00:30:31,112 --> 00:30:33,842
No, she's not happily married.
You'd love her.

475
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,850
Tell me, who is she?
How do you know her?

476
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:40,354
My friend's mother is her shrink.
I know everything about her.

477
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,855
- You're kidding. What's her name?
- I don't know.

478
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:47,054
- What do you mean, you don't know?
Stop teasing me. - I'm serious.

479
00:30:47,128 --> 00:30:50,894
- Who is she? - She's an art historian
and she's here to see the Tintorettos.

480
00:30:50,965 --> 00:30:53,627
- Yeah?
- You know what I'm thinking?

481
00:30:53,701 --> 00:30:56,226
- You got that look on your face.
- This is perfect.

482
00:30:56,304 --> 00:30:59,000
- She jogs every morning alone.
- Yeah?

483
00:30:59,073 --> 00:31:01,598
You could go and bump into her
and meet her.

484
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:03,735
No, thank you.
She's a married woman.

485
00:31:03,811 --> 00:31:06,405
I'm telling you,
she's not happily married.

486
00:31:06,481 --> 00:31:10,349
- Mm-hmm? - Complete
mismatch. The guy's some actor.

487
00:31:10,418 --> 00:31:13,285
Anyway, it won't interfere
tomorrow because he sleeps late,

488
00:31:13,354 --> 00:31:15,288
so you'll have no problem.

489
00:31:15,356 --> 00:31:18,723
You can meet her. She'll definitely
be alone. I know this for a fact.

490
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,727
It's perfect.

491
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,320
I'm out of shape.
I can't jog. I can't do it.

492
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:28,665
I haven't touched my treadmill
in weeks... 572 weeks. That's 11 years.

493
00:31:28,736 --> 00:31:32,137
- I wheeze. Stop looking at me like that.
- No.

494
00:31:32,206 --> 00:31:34,834
- I'm not gonna do this.
- We're gonna get you some jogging clothes.

495
00:31:34,909 --> 00:31:38,345
- She is really something.
- Tomorrow morning... you're gonna jog.

496
00:32:26,894 --> 00:32:29,226
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.

497
00:32:29,297 --> 00:32:31,322
- Are you okay?
- Yes. Are you all right?

498
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:34,493
- Yeah. - You don't happen
to know which way the Gritti is?

499
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:37,629
Uh... I think it's back that way.

500
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,639
- [Panting] Over there?
- Yeah.

501
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:43,700
- 'Cause jogging in Venice,
everything is so serpen... - Labyrinthine.

502
00:32:43,778 --> 00:32:45,712
- Labyrinthine!
- Yes. You okay?

503
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,714
[Panting]
Yes, I'm fine.

504
00:32:47,782 --> 00:32:50,580
You gotta keep in shape.
I jog every day. You?

505
00:32:50,652 --> 00:32:52,745
- Yes, I do.
- You an American?

506
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:56,278
- I... Yeah.
- It's a great country, isn't it?

507
00:32:56,357 --> 00:32:59,019
- It's beautiful.
- The mountains and the prairies.

508
00:32:59,093 --> 00:33:02,654
- Oh, Amer... Yeah, America. - The oceans,
you know, white with foam and everything.

509
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,994
So... [Groans]

510
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:07,967
- Are you okay? You okay?
- Yes.

511
00:33:08,036 --> 00:33:10,231
- Sit down.
- No, I'm okay. [Coughs]

512
00:33:10,304 --> 00:33:12,135
- I'm okay.
- Yeah?

513
00:33:12,206 --> 00:33:15,573
I have a pain in my chest
that's radiating down my arm.

514
00:33:15,643 --> 00:33:19,704
- That's your heart. - No. In my case,
it's stress. I get it every other day.

515
00:33:19,781 --> 00:33:21,408
- Okay. Breathe.
- What is your name?

516
00:33:21,482 --> 00:33:24,815
- Von! Oh, here you are.
- Hi.

517
00:33:24,886 --> 00:33:27,855
I was just giving him
directions. Are you okay?

518
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:31,653
- Okay. You said you wanted to do
three miles. Come on. - You okay?

519
00:33:31,726 --> 00:33:33,853
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Breathe, breathe.

520
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,828
Nice shoes.

521
00:33:35,897 --> 00:33:39,526
[Panting] First I nearly
drop dead. I couldn't breathe.

522
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,534
Then her husband showed up.

523
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:44,196
Her husband did come, huh? That's rare.

524
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:47,173
Rare? So is a coronary
thrombosis in our family.

525
00:33:47,241 --> 00:33:49,209
Oh, did you get her name?

526
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,768
Von. Vonnie.

527
00:33:51,846 --> 00:33:55,805
Listen, she's passionate about Tintoretto.
She's working on a book about him.

528
00:33:55,883 --> 00:33:59,683
Obviously she's here to visit
the Scuola Grande di San Rocco.

529
00:33:59,754 --> 00:34:02,780
I don't know what all this means.
What are all these art books?

530
00:34:02,857 --> 00:34:06,850
She'll be at the Scuola. He
won't. They have nothing in common.

531
00:34:06,928 --> 00:34:09,795
You bump into her again. Now
the groundwork's been laid.

532
00:34:09,864 --> 00:34:12,389
You say, " Hello.
Didn't we meet jogging?"

533
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,799
I was the guy who had the sudden stroke.

534
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:18,600
Then you impress her with your
knowledge of her favorite painter.

535
00:34:18,673 --> 00:34:21,801
Hey, you gotta be kidding. My
knowledge of art is limited...

536
00:34:21,876 --> 00:34:24,743
to Kirk Douglas as Vincent van Gogh.

537
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,542
- What the hell do I know about this?
- Trust me, Dad.

538
00:34:27,615 --> 00:34:31,608
Before we leave Venice, your
lips will be pressed to hers.

539
00:34:31,686 --> 00:34:35,315
Yes. Unfortunately, I left
my Chapstick in New York.

540
00:34:38,025 --> 00:34:42,962
What is this? "The rapidity
of his brush strokes..."

541
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:46,466
"Chiaroscuro outbursts of color..."

542
00:34:46,534 --> 00:34:49,162
[D.J. Narrating] I told Dad
everything I knew about Von...

543
00:34:49,237 --> 00:34:51,501
and he studied his Tintoretto book.

544
00:34:51,572 --> 00:34:55,303
I told him her likes, her
dislikes, her deepest feelings,

545
00:34:55,376 --> 00:34:58,834
everything from her passion for Bora
Bora and "Mahler's Fourth Symphony"...

546
00:34:58,913 --> 00:35:00,847
to her favorite flower:
the African daisy.

547
00:35:00,915 --> 00:35:02,849
I mean, it was everything.

548
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:06,148
When he showed up at the
Tintoretto Museum that afternoon,

549
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,054
he could've given a
course on the subject.

550
00:35:10,124 --> 00:35:14,151
- Hello again.
- Hi. Goodness.

551
00:35:14,228 --> 00:35:16,696
You lived. How are you? I was concerned.

552
00:35:16,764 --> 00:35:20,097
Oh, no, I was fine. I just
went back to the hotel before...

553
00:35:20,168 --> 00:35:23,331
and had the concierge...
oil my pacemaker.

554
00:35:23,404 --> 00:35:26,840
- [Chuckles] - You know, I...
Incidentally, my name is Joe Berlin.

555
00:35:26,908 --> 00:35:29,035
Vonnie Sydell.

556
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,544
It's a funny coincidence I see you here.

557
00:35:31,612 --> 00:35:36,015
You know, two New Yorkers jogging in
Venice and we bump into each other.

558
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:38,881
- How did you know I was a New Yorker?
- No, I didn't.

559
00:35:38,953 --> 00:35:42,184
But, you know, I, like,
assumed that, you know...

560
00:35:42,256 --> 00:35:45,191
You're completely correct
to ask that question.

561
00:35:45,259 --> 00:35:48,285
It's a good question. You
should not be ashamed of it.

562
00:35:48,362 --> 00:35:51,559
Well, I live on 84th and Riverside.
Where in New York do you live?

563
00:35:51,632 --> 00:35:55,830
In Paris. Well, I-I was a New
Yorker, but now I settled in Paris.

564
00:35:55,903 --> 00:36:00,203
But I come back to New York all
the time 'cause I love it there.

565
00:36:00,274 --> 00:36:02,139
What brings you here?

566
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:06,738
Oh, I wouldn't think of being in Venice
without checking out the Tintorettos,

567
00:36:06,814 --> 00:36:10,443
because he was... he's my
favorite... master in the world.

568
00:36:10,518 --> 00:36:13,112
I just adore his work.
I'm crazy about it.

569
00:36:13,187 --> 00:36:15,121
He was a very deep genius.

570
00:36:15,189 --> 00:36:19,990
The deepest. Th-The
rapidity of his brush work.

571
00:36:20,061 --> 00:36:23,292
Th-The chiaroscuro...
outbursts of color.

572
00:36:23,364 --> 00:36:26,731
His capacity for controlled gesture.

573
00:36:26,801 --> 00:36:31,295
[Clears Throat] Born in 1519,
only to die again in 1594,

574
00:36:31,372 --> 00:36:35,570
but that's... the way
it happens to most of us.

575
00:36:35,643 --> 00:36:38,840
So you have a real
appreciation of his work.

576
00:36:38,913 --> 00:36:42,815
How could I not have an appreciation
of a man who was short in stature...

577
00:36:42,884 --> 00:36:45,910
but with a proud and obstinate nature,

578
00:36:45,987 --> 00:36:50,185
who painted outside the,
the academic convention...

579
00:36:50,258 --> 00:36:54,024
of 16th century Venice? [Chuckles]

580
00:36:54,095 --> 00:36:56,029
What do you do, Mr. Berlin?

581
00:36:56,097 --> 00:37:00,466
You can call me Joe. I'm-I'm-I'm
a writer. Novelist, mostly.

582
00:37:00,534 --> 00:37:03,594
Joe Berlin. I saw one of your books.

583
00:37:03,671 --> 00:37:07,038
I did. I remember it.
It had a very sexy cover.

584
00:37:07,108 --> 00:37:10,839
It was at the stalls on
Fifth Avenue, the 99-cent bin.

585
00:37:10,912 --> 00:37:14,109
Well, you know, probably... [Clears
Throat] the get-acquainted price.

586
00:37:14,181 --> 00:37:16,274
- Oh.
- They'll do that sometimes.

587
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:18,944
In the United States, I'm
considered controversial,

588
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:22,547
but in Paris, where they have
an ear for literature, I...

589
00:37:22,623 --> 00:37:25,558
You know, they were quick
to recognize the genius...

590
00:37:25,626 --> 00:37:28,220
of Poe and Faulkner and myself.

591
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,799
Well, basically, you
see, I'm a simple guy.

592
00:37:32,867 --> 00:37:36,963
My idea is just to live in
Paris and maybe, you know,

593
00:37:37,038 --> 00:37:39,336
fall in love and...

594
00:37:39,407 --> 00:37:42,570
and take walks, uh, in the rain...

595
00:37:42,643 --> 00:37:45,339
and-and, uh, listen to music,

596
00:37:45,413 --> 00:37:49,076
like, uh, particularly,
maybe "Mahler's Fourth."

597
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:54,245
- This could be me talking. "Mahler's
Fourth" destroys me. - Could it?

598
00:37:54,322 --> 00:37:56,347
Ah, yes, "Mahler's Fourth," no question.

599
00:37:56,424 --> 00:37:59,120
I... I... See, I'm not... I'm not a, uh...

600
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,855
what you'd call a, uh,
uh, a technology guy.

601
00:38:01,929 --> 00:38:04,557
- I hate technology.
- I know. I could tell by looking at you.

602
00:38:04,632 --> 00:38:07,100
I-I-I, uh... I'm...
I still work on...

603
00:38:07,168 --> 00:38:11,298
one of those old-fashioned antique
portable typewriters that-that...

604
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:14,773
Are you telling me you haven't
succumbed to the cerebral computer age?

605
00:38:14,842 --> 00:38:18,107
[Scoffs] You know, I'm telling
you, I like the simple life.

606
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:20,647
I like to sit in my
room in Paris and write,

607
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:24,207
maybe visit New York a certain
amount in the summertime.

608
00:38:24,285 --> 00:38:29,587
Maybe spend some time some place
romantic, like, um, Bora Bora.

609
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,493
I... I love Bora Bora.

610
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,189
Since the first time I went there,
I can't get it out of my mind.

611
00:38:36,263 --> 00:38:38,697
Well, naturally. You
know, it's beautiful.

612
00:38:38,766 --> 00:38:41,894
At night, the stars are so
luminous you can practically...

613
00:38:41,969 --> 00:38:43,903
- Read by them.
- read by them.

614
00:38:43,971 --> 00:38:46,963
Yes. Are you okay?

615
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:51,535
A little mist appeared in your eye then.

616
00:38:51,612 --> 00:38:55,104
I thought you were gonna cry. I
swear, I thought you were gonna cry.

617
00:38:55,182 --> 00:38:57,207
No, I'm, uh... I'm okay.

618
00:38:57,284 --> 00:39:00,879
- Are you sure? Is something wrong?
- No, um...

619
00:39:00,955 --> 00:39:04,288
- What's wrong? - Nothing's wrong.
Something's so exactly right.

620
00:39:04,358 --> 00:39:06,292
- Yes?
- Yeah.

621
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,591
Wait here one second.
I'll be right back.

622
00:39:16,737 --> 00:39:20,696
# All my life #

623
00:39:23,177 --> 00:39:27,773
# I've been waiting for you #

624
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:32,177
# My wonderful one #

625
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:37,748
# I've begun living #

626
00:39:40,094 --> 00:39:43,791
# All my life #

627
00:39:47,935 --> 00:39:51,928
# All my love #

628
00:39:54,775 --> 00:39:59,337
# Has been waiting for you #

629
00:40:00,848 --> 00:40:04,807
# My life is sublime #

630
00:40:04,885 --> 00:40:11,120
# Now that I'm giving #

631
00:40:12,193 --> 00:40:15,993
# All my love ##

632
00:40:17,231 --> 00:40:19,199
I got you a present.

633
00:40:19,266 --> 00:40:22,463
An African daisy. This is my favorite.

634
00:40:22,536 --> 00:40:25,733
You know, what are you doing tonight?

635
00:40:25,806 --> 00:40:29,298
I think Greg and I have plans.

636
00:40:29,376 --> 00:40:31,901
- [Door Opening]
- Hey, how'd it go?

637
00:40:31,979 --> 00:40:35,847
She was absolutely great. Whatever
you told me was right on the money.

638
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:38,180
- I feel guilty.
- Why?

639
00:40:38,252 --> 00:40:42,951
Because, you know, I made her cry.
She said that she felt close to me.

640
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:46,857
So? You've established a beachhead.
Now you go on and win the battle.

641
00:40:46,927 --> 00:40:51,091
Don't forget to blow on her back between
her shoulder blades. It makes her crazy.

642
00:40:51,165 --> 00:40:53,292
Hey, I'm not gonna do that.

643
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:56,302
What goes on between her
and her shrink is private.

644
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:59,862
What are you gonna do, give me
a map of her erogenous zones?

645
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,376
- Dad, are you seeing her tonight?
- No, she's married!

646
00:41:03,444 --> 00:41:07,881
Listen, I'm not that guy. I don't
know Bora Bora from Walla Walla.

647
00:41:07,948 --> 00:41:10,382
What the hell do I
know about Tintoretto?

648
00:41:10,451 --> 00:41:14,148
I can't tell the difference between
his chiaroscuro and his segretto sauce.

649
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,883
Don't forget to blow
between her shoulder blades.

650
00:41:16,957 --> 00:41:19,391
I'm not gonna blow between
her shoulder blades.

651
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,224
Plus, I use a word
processor, not a typewriter.

652
00:41:22,296 --> 00:41:26,460
I hope you have something great to wear
tonight, 'cause we're going to a party.

653
00:41:26,534 --> 00:41:28,468
A party? I...

654
00:41:28,536 --> 00:41:30,936
I wanna introduce you to someone.

655
00:41:33,874 --> 00:41:36,399
- Dad.
- [Kisses Cheek]

656
00:41:36,477 --> 00:41:38,377
This is Alberto.

657
00:41:38,445 --> 00:41:40,606
- Hi, how are you?
- Nice to meet you.

658
00:41:40,681 --> 00:41:42,945
Who are all these people? This is, uh...

659
00:41:43,017 --> 00:41:46,578
- Venetians. Friends, guests in town.
- Yes?

660
00:41:46,654 --> 00:41:49,122
Did your enjoy your staying in Venice?

661
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:51,852
Fabulous. It's the best. Absolutely
the best. She'll tell you.

662
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:55,862
Dad, I wanted you to meet Alberto because
I think you should be the first to know:

663
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,864
We're getting married.

664
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,594
Wonderful. Let me know what
century, I'll rent a tux.

665
00:42:00,668 --> 00:42:02,533
This January.

666
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,594
- Pardon me?
- This January.

667
00:42:04,672 --> 00:42:07,539
This January. [Chuckles]
You're joking, of course.

668
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,838
I am in love with Djuna.

669
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:12,640
We all love this little
girl because she's adorable.

670
00:42:12,713 --> 00:42:15,409
But... But you are... This is a jest.

671
00:42:15,482 --> 00:42:20,317
It is January 15, to be exact.
It's his mother's birthday.

672
00:42:20,387 --> 00:42:24,756
- A joke. A jest, right? Am I right?
- Not at all.

673
00:42:24,825 --> 00:42:26,884
Excuse... Excuse me one second. Come on.

674
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:31,489
I just wanna talk to you for a minute. Come
over here. Just for a second. Right here.

675
00:42:31,565 --> 00:42:34,898
What are you talking about?
Tell me this is a joke.

676
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,903
Otherwise, there's gonna be carnage.

677
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,235
We're crazy about each other.

678
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:43,504
How can you be crazy... You
met this guy... five days ago.

679
00:42:43,577 --> 00:42:46,171
- So? - What do you mean, so?
Are you having a breakdown?

680
00:42:46,247 --> 00:42:48,181
Why, because I'm in love?

681
00:42:48,249 --> 00:42:51,013
What do you mean, you're in
love? With what? What does he do?

682
00:42:51,085 --> 00:42:53,747
- He's a gondolier.
- A... No, thank you.

683
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:56,984
- He's one of those guys with the
striped shirt and the hat? - No hat.

684
00:42:57,057 --> 00:42:59,855
- What do you mean, no hat?
- He doesn't wear a hat.

685
00:42:59,927 --> 00:43:03,363
This is crazy. What are
you, you know... Talk to me.

686
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:06,763
- Are you gonna... Are you talking
about getting married? - Yes.

687
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,768
- That's insanity.
- Why is it insanity?

688
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:12,294
Because you have to go to school.
You're gonna go back to Columbia.

689
00:43:12,373 --> 00:43:15,638
You're gonna major in journalism
or law, not... not rowing.

690
00:43:15,709 --> 00:43:19,145
People have dropped out of
Columbia before. It's been done.

691
00:43:19,213 --> 00:43:22,239
You are not going to
run off with a guy...

692
00:43:22,316 --> 00:43:24,841
who you just met and who's a gondolier.

693
00:43:24,918 --> 00:43:27,045
- He's a poet.
- He's a poet?

694
00:43:27,121 --> 00:43:30,454
Let me tell you what rhymes
with gondolier: no lira.

695
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,685
- Okay? So, forget it.
- Oh, God, Dad.

696
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,067
- Hi.
- Hi. Hello, again.

697
00:43:43,137 --> 00:43:46,664
- My God, what a coincidence.
- This is, uh... Joe, Greg.

698
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,605
- Hi. How do you do?
- Hi.

699
00:43:48,676 --> 00:43:52,510
- Were you... You were running this
morning... with the heart? - That was me.

700
00:43:52,579 --> 00:43:54,843
Have you seen Bernardo
Bertolucci? Is he here?

701
00:43:54,915 --> 00:43:57,941
I wouldn't recognize him
'cause it's a madhouse in there.

702
00:43:58,018 --> 00:44:01,510
- Do you mind if I go ahead? If you want
to talk. Okay. - It's an absolute madhouse.

703
00:44:01,588 --> 00:44:03,522
I'll get you a drink.

704
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:05,683
- Incredible. I mean...
- Is it?

705
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:09,786
Have you seen this place? I was
just going home. It's unbelievable.

706
00:44:09,863 --> 00:44:14,630
- They have a... The whole thing is like
it's an old palazzo. - Oh, wow.

707
00:44:14,702 --> 00:44:16,829
- And it's really, really beautiful.
- [Gasps]

708
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,134
But, you know, frantic in there.

709
00:44:19,206 --> 00:44:21,333
- Hey, you look great.
- Oh.

710
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:24,002
I wish you wouldn't
say things like that.

711
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:27,479
- Why?
- I don't know. I can't take a compliment.

712
00:44:27,548 --> 00:44:30,210
You look terrific. Why not? I'm sorry.

713
00:44:30,284 --> 00:44:33,014
No, it's my problem. [Laughs]

714
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:36,784
- Why? Does it make you feel guilty?
- Uh, maybe. I don't know.

715
00:44:36,857 --> 00:44:39,417
You seem to have all
the answers, don't you?

716
00:44:39,493 --> 00:44:41,825
I think it makes you feel guilty.

717
00:44:41,895 --> 00:44:46,559
I think that you must have fantasies
of maybe somebody coming along that...

718
00:44:46,633 --> 00:44:50,501
You probably have dreams about boats...

719
00:44:50,571 --> 00:44:52,698
or... ships, maybe,

720
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:57,437
or maybe even, you know,
like an elevator that...

721
00:44:57,511 --> 00:45:01,038
You're on an elevator and it goes
higher and higher to the top floor...

722
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,709
and then it doesn't stop at the top,

723
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:06,116
it just goes right through the roof...

724
00:45:06,186 --> 00:45:09,451
and it just sort of
flies you over the ocean.

725
00:45:11,525 --> 00:45:14,460
I think I'm gonna faint. I do.

726
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,787
- Are you okay?
- Uh, uh, no.

727
00:45:17,865 --> 00:45:20,766
I'm... I'm a little overwhelmed...

728
00:45:20,834 --> 00:45:24,531
and I'm glad you're leaving tomorrow.

729
00:45:24,605 --> 00:45:26,800
[Blowing]

730
00:45:47,294 --> 00:45:49,819
[D.J. Narrating] The next
morning, we left Venice.

731
00:45:49,897 --> 00:45:53,094
Dad made a flight to Paris
and I went to New York.

732
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:56,227
I couldn't wait to tell
Mom about marrying Alberto.

733
00:45:56,303 --> 00:45:58,897
He was so beautiful, so sensitive.

734
00:45:58,972 --> 00:46:03,272
My plan was to drop out of Columbia
after the fall term and move to Italy.

735
00:46:05,412 --> 00:46:08,347
- Uh, excuse me. That's mine.
- No, it's...

736
00:46:08,415 --> 00:46:10,406
Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

737
00:46:10,484 --> 00:46:12,850
Oh, God, I'm sorry. It's not mine.

738
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,356
- It's okay. We both like shopping
at Hunting World. - That's where I got it.

739
00:46:16,423 --> 00:46:19,358
- Oh, God, now I know it's mine.
- It's all right. I'll give you a hand.

740
00:46:19,426 --> 00:46:21,519
- Thanks.
- Um... your bra.

741
00:46:21,595 --> 00:46:24,462
- [Chuckles] Thank you. Yeah.
- Underwear.

742
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:26,590
Petrarch's sonnets. What do you do?

743
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:29,932
Um, depends who the guy
is. No, just kidding.

744
00:46:30,003 --> 00:46:34,235
Um, I actua... 'Cause I work
for the Colombian drug cartel.

745
00:46:34,308 --> 00:46:37,243
- Yeah, I gift wrap
the cocaine. - Mm-hmm.

746
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:40,474
Why am I so nervous? I'm
a student at Columbia.

747
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:43,015
- Oh, is that right? My uncle teaches there.
- No.

748
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:46,678
Yeah. Math Department.
I'm, uh, Ken Grisley.

749
00:46:46,753 --> 00:46:48,846
Djuna Berlin.

750
00:46:48,922 --> 00:46:52,255
[D.J. Narrating] Did I really want
to spend my life making pasta...

751
00:46:52,326 --> 00:46:54,692
and riding around in gondolas?

752
00:46:54,761 --> 00:46:57,992
To tell you the truth, those
canals are awfully polluted.

753
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:00,192
I mean, Alberto was cute,

754
00:47:00,267 --> 00:47:03,464
but Ken was... hot.

755
00:47:04,671 --> 00:47:07,970
# Cuddle up a little closer #

756
00:47:09,042 --> 00:47:11,602
# Lovey mine #

757
00:47:13,814 --> 00:47:17,773
# Cuddle up and be my little #

758
00:47:17,851 --> 00:47:20,820
# Clinging vine #

759
00:47:22,189 --> 00:47:26,592
# I like to feel your cheeks so rosy #

760
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:31,324
# Like to make you comfy-cozy #

761
00:47:31,398 --> 00:47:36,165
# 'Cause I love from head to toesy #

762
00:47:36,236 --> 00:47:39,603
# Lovey mine #

## [Both Singing In Hindi]

765
00:48:23,283 --> 00:48:26,446
[D.J. Narrating] While I'd been
away, an awful lot had happened.

766
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,751
Mom bought Skylar a
drop-dead wedding dress,

767
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:32,792
and Holden's father and
my stepdad became friends.

768
00:48:32,859 --> 00:48:35,828
They discovered a common
interest: horse racing.

769
00:48:35,896 --> 00:48:38,524
So, they chipped in and
bought a thoroughbred.

770
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:41,727
And Lane and Laura had a
great time at the beach.

771
00:48:41,802 --> 00:48:45,863
But one hot summer weekend, with
everyone else in New York away,

772
00:48:45,939 --> 00:48:48,464
they found themselves in town.

773
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,758
- So, we're probably the only ones left
in the city this weekend. - Yeah.

774
00:49:10,831 --> 00:49:15,131
We usually go to South Hampton, but
this weekend we had tickets to a show.

775
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:18,797
I love the city when it's empty.

776
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,806
- Me too.
- Me too.

777
00:49:22,576 --> 00:49:26,103
[D.J. Narrating] To make a long
story short, they've all become close.

778
00:49:26,179 --> 00:49:30,047
His name... if you can believe
it... is Jeffrey Vandermost,

779
00:49:30,117 --> 00:49:32,483
and he's heir to the
Vandermost millions.

780
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:36,852
Meanwhile, they're both in love with him,
and one of them's heading for a broken heart.

781
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:41,393
[D.J. Narrating] Fall was
particularly beautiful this year.

782
00:49:41,461 --> 00:49:44,396
I think I like it even
better than spring,

783
00:49:44,464 --> 00:49:47,456
and with October comes Mom's birthday.

784
00:49:47,534 --> 00:49:50,992
This year we invited Holden's
parents over to celebrate,

785
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:54,802
but just before they arrived
we had an unexpected visitor.

786
00:49:54,875 --> 00:49:56,809
That's a gorgeous color.

787
00:49:56,877 --> 00:49:58,811
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, thank you, sweetie.

788
00:49:58,879 --> 00:50:01,814
- These are from your ex-husband,
my biological father. - Oh! Joe!

789
00:50:01,882 --> 00:50:04,817
- Oh, look, everybody!
- You know what that is? That's caviar.

790
00:50:04,885 --> 00:50:08,321
Frieda, could you put this on
ice? Nothing like sturgeon eggs.

791
00:50:08,388 --> 00:50:10,322
- Are you expecting Mr. Ferry?
- I am, yes.

792
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:12,324
- [Bob] You are?
- Charles Ferry?

793
00:50:12,392 --> 00:50:15,327
He just got out of prison. He has
no family. I figured, you know...

794
00:50:15,395 --> 00:50:17,329
- So he can join our family?
- What?

795
00:50:17,397 --> 00:50:21,333
- You're letting a criminal come into this
house? - He's paid his debt to society.

796
00:50:21,401 --> 00:50:23,835
Don't start. I don't wanna hear this.

797
00:50:23,904 --> 00:50:27,840
No! Society forgave him his debts.
He did not pay his debt to society.

798
00:50:27,908 --> 00:50:31,344
How did I wind up with a kid on the other
end of the political spectrum from me?

799
00:50:31,411 --> 00:50:33,845
- Where did I fail?
- You didn't fail, Dad.

800
00:50:33,914 --> 00:50:36,849
- If I was you, I'd start hiding the
silverware. - Don't be rude, Scott.

801
00:50:36,917 --> 00:50:39,852
- [Doorbell Rings]
- He's coming over for just a drink.

802
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,854
[Steffi] You guys have everything.

803
00:50:41,922 --> 00:50:45,517
Mr. Ferry, hi. I'm... I'm Bob
Dandridge. This is my wife Steffi.

804
00:50:45,592 --> 00:50:48,527
Hello, Mr. Ferry. Welcome
to our home. Welcome.

805
00:50:48,595 --> 00:50:51,530
I'd like you to meet my daughter Skylar.

806
00:50:51,598 --> 00:50:54,032
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- This is Skylar and her fiance Holden.

807
00:50:54,101 --> 00:50:56,035
[Clears Throat] I'm... I'm the fiance.

808
00:50:56,103 --> 00:50:59,095
- Uh, can I get you something to dr...
- Nobody gets behind me.

809
00:50:59,172 --> 00:51:01,106
- [Nervous Chuckle]
- Right. Okay. Sure.

810
00:51:01,174 --> 00:51:04,302
- Uh, can I get you something to drink?
- Uh, vodka.

811
00:51:04,377 --> 00:51:07,312
Right. Maybe, uh, on
the... Uh, or, or...

812
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:09,314
- Maybe right in the arm.
- Just... Just...

813
00:51:09,382 --> 00:51:11,816
I'll, I'll get you a... Straight up.

814
00:51:11,885 --> 00:51:13,819
Honey, Mr. Perr... Mr. Ferry. Sorry.

815
00:51:13,887 --> 00:51:17,983
Uh, he's been living amongst vicious
killers. No wonder he's skittish.

816
00:51:18,058 --> 00:51:20,993
- A lot of times a guy'll come up
behind ya and... Swish! - "Swish"?

817
00:51:21,061 --> 00:51:23,996
You get your blade out quick, you
stick it in him, or you're dead.

818
00:51:24,064 --> 00:51:25,998
- Ahh.
- The blade. The blade.

819
00:51:26,066 --> 00:51:29,001
H-Have you stuck a lot of
other inmates, Mr. Ferry?

820
00:51:29,069 --> 00:51:31,003
- [Doorbell Rings]
- Enough.

821
00:51:31,071 --> 00:51:33,005
- Uh, the d... the doorbell.
- That's enough for me.

822
00:51:33,073 --> 00:51:35,007
- How many is "enough"?
- How is that?

823
00:51:35,075 --> 00:51:37,509
- Would you like another one?
- Oh, it's your parents.

824
00:51:37,577 --> 00:51:39,841
- Hi! Hello. How are you?
- Ohh!

825
00:51:39,913 --> 00:51:41,847
- Good to see you, dear.
- Hi, Arnold.

826
00:51:41,915 --> 00:51:45,351
- Happy birthday, Steffi.
- Oh, thank you, Lynn. Thanks for coming.

827
00:51:45,418 --> 00:51:48,353
Hi, Arnold. I have
someone I want you to meet.

828
00:51:48,421 --> 00:51:51,356
Mr. Ferry. Mr. Ferry. I'd
like you to meet Mr. Ferry.

829
00:51:51,424 --> 00:51:53,858
This is my good friend Lynn.

830
00:51:53,927 --> 00:51:55,861
- And this is Arnold.
- I must say...

831
00:51:55,929 --> 00:51:58,864
- Mr. Ferry is just out of prison.
- Yes, I'm aware.

832
00:51:58,932 --> 00:52:02,368
I'm lucky the parole came through, but
I was gonna get out one way or the other.

833
00:52:02,435 --> 00:52:04,995
- What exactly does that mean?
- Ice the guard.

834
00:52:05,071 --> 00:52:07,005
- No pictures, sister.
- I'm sorry.

835
00:52:07,073 --> 00:52:09,507
What do you mean, "ice the guard"?

836
00:52:09,576 --> 00:52:12,010
- Get out through the ventilation shaft.
- Ice. Really?

837
00:52:12,078 --> 00:52:15,514
Come up behind him with a box
cutter, rip out his carotid artery.

838
00:52:15,582 --> 00:52:17,516
- Oh.
- What's a box cutter?

839
00:52:17,584 --> 00:52:20,519
- May I have a glass of white wine?
- We have white wine.

840
00:52:20,587 --> 00:52:22,521
You gotta be careful, though.

841
00:52:22,589 --> 00:52:26,025
Guy on cell block four tried it,
didn't have all the angles figured.

842
00:52:26,092 --> 00:52:29,027
- Got his tit caught in the wringer.
- His tit? Really?

843
00:52:29,095 --> 00:52:32,155
- Oh, uh, the terrace.
- Let's go up to the terrace.

844
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:35,167
- Good idea. Let's get some
wine. - Big, wide-open spaces.

845
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,169
Are you sure this guy is rehabilitated?

846
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:40,172
Honey, he was in prison,
not a finishing school.

847
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,174
Well, you know my sentiments,

848
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,176
but very happy birthday.

849
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,303
A birthday song for Steffi.

850
00:52:49,382 --> 00:52:53,682
# Looking at you while
troubles are fleeing #

851
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:56,586
# I'm admiring the view #

852
00:52:56,656 --> 00:52:58,783
# 'Cause it's you I'm seeing #

853
00:52:58,859 --> 00:53:01,623
# And the sweet honeydew #

854
00:53:01,695 --> 00:53:07,930
# Of well-being settles upon me #

855
00:53:09,202 --> 00:53:11,500
# What is this light #

856
00:53:11,571 --> 00:53:13,630
# That shines when you enter #

857
00:53:13,707 --> 00:53:16,471
# Like a star in the night #

858
00:53:16,543 --> 00:53:21,571
# And what's to prevent her
from destroying my sight #

859
00:53:21,648 --> 00:53:28,986
# If you center all of it on me #

860
00:53:29,055 --> 00:53:31,285
# Looking at you #

861
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:34,418
# I'm filled with the essence of #

862
00:53:34,494 --> 00:53:38,590
# The quintessence of joy #

863
00:53:38,665 --> 00:53:40,860
# Looking at you #

864
00:53:40,934 --> 00:53:43,835
# I hear poets tellin' of #

865
00:53:43,904 --> 00:53:47,067
# Lovely Helen of Troy #

866
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,131
# Darling #

867
00:53:49,209 --> 00:53:51,837
# Life seemed so gray #

868
00:53:51,912 --> 00:53:56,849
# I wanted to end it
'til that wonderful day #

869
00:53:56,917 --> 00:53:59,317
# You started to mend it #

870
00:53:59,386 --> 00:54:02,549
# And if you'll only stay #

871
00:54:02,622 --> 00:54:04,920
# Then I'll spend it #

872
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:07,516
# Looking at #

873
00:54:07,594 --> 00:54:10,586
# You ##

874
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:13,326
[Kisses]

875
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,960
[Steffi] Sweetie. [Continues Kissing]

876
00:54:16,036 --> 00:54:17,970
- Ohh.
- [Bob] Is that okay?

877
00:54:18,038 --> 00:54:19,972
Okay? Honey.

878
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,975
- I'm gonna grab a few drinks.
You want anything? - No, thanks.

879
00:54:23,043 --> 00:54:26,479
But before you do, would you get Steffi's
present for me? I left it in the car.

880
00:54:26,546 --> 00:54:29,777
- Oh, yeah.
- Holden, here.

881
00:54:31,117 --> 00:54:33,551
[Skylar] Are you enjoying the view?

882
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:36,953
I like any view after years and
years in that stinkin' rat hole.

883
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:39,321
Oh. That's very vividly put.

884
00:54:39,392 --> 00:54:41,326
S-Sweetly honest.

885
00:54:41,394 --> 00:54:44,329
You know what it's like
in solitary confinement?

886
00:54:44,397 --> 00:54:46,831
No, I can't say that I do.

887
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,835
I went to N.Y.U. I didn't
even stay in the dorm.

888
00:54:49,903 --> 00:54:53,839
- You know how long it is since I smelled
perfume? - Oh, do I have too much on?

889
00:54:53,907 --> 00:54:57,343
No, to me you smell like what
I think heaven would smell like.

890
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:59,844
Oh. Well, thank you. That's really nice.

891
00:54:59,913 --> 00:55:04,612
When you shook my hand before, I
thought my heart was gonna stop.

892
00:55:04,684 --> 00:55:06,618
Oh, that's sweet. [Chuckles]

893
00:55:06,686 --> 00:55:10,122
Uh, but remember, you've been
very deprived of female contact.

894
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:13,626
I used to lie in my cell at night
and dream of somebody like you.

895
00:55:13,693 --> 00:55:15,957
[Laughs] Yeah.

896
00:55:16,029 --> 00:55:19,430
Oh, uh, I took, um, a
criminology class in college.

897
00:55:19,499 --> 00:55:22,127
- A very insight...
- You have very sensual lips.

898
00:55:22,202 --> 00:55:25,933
Oh. O-Oh, well, i-it's a
part of me I rarely think of.

899
00:55:26,006 --> 00:55:29,339
- Can I smell your hair?
- You wanna smell my hair?

900
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:33,140
Okay. You know what? It's
gonna be all gone soon.

901
00:55:33,213 --> 00:55:36,649
I was thinking of cutting it. I
think Holden might like it short.

902
00:55:36,716 --> 00:55:39,651
You know what I would
do if you were my girl?

903
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:41,983
It's a little chilly outside.

904
00:55:42,055 --> 00:55:45,991
- Maybe I should get a shawl. - I would
make love to you in every room in the house.

905
00:55:47,327 --> 00:55:49,761
On every bed.

906
00:55:49,829 --> 00:55:52,263
On every rug.

907
00:55:52,332 --> 00:55:55,096
On every tabletop.

908
00:55:55,168 --> 00:55:59,104
We also have some lovely
early American chandeliers.

909
00:56:00,673 --> 00:56:02,607
Let's go for a drive.

910
00:56:04,544 --> 00:56:07,980
Um, no. I don't think that
that would be such a good idea.

911
00:56:08,048 --> 00:56:12,007
I haven't seen the ocean or been
up to Harlem or Chinatown in years.

912
00:56:12,085 --> 00:56:14,417
Oh, no, i-it's out of the question.

913
00:56:14,487 --> 00:56:17,888
- Okay, but you can't blame me for tryin'.
- No.

914
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:20,892
I think that we should
get back inside before...

915
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,894
Before what?

916
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:25,396
Before you break your parole.

917
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:30,402
If I took you in my arms and kissed
you right now, would you dime on me?

918
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,938
- "Dime"?
- Turn me in.

919
00:56:33,006 --> 00:56:35,634
Oh. Let's not find out.

920
00:56:35,708 --> 00:56:37,642
Mmm.

921
00:56:48,054 --> 00:56:50,079
How was it?

922
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:52,090
Uh...

923
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,822
Very interesting.

924
00:56:56,896 --> 00:57:00,332
I've never been kissed
by a sociopath before.

925
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:04,129
I kissed you the best I could,

926
00:57:04,204 --> 00:57:07,139
considering the only practice I
had kissing in the last 10 years...

927
00:57:07,207 --> 00:57:09,141
is with Vincent "The Thumb" Adatto.

928
00:57:20,386 --> 00:57:22,320
Jeez.

929
00:57:22,388 --> 00:57:25,323
Vincent "The Thumb" doesn't
know what he's missing.

930
00:57:26,926 --> 00:57:28,860
Can I see you again?

931
00:57:28,928 --> 00:57:30,862
[Sighs] Well...

932
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,300
You know, I'm getting married.

933
00:57:38,104 --> 00:57:42,564
# I could show the world how to smile #

934
00:57:42,642 --> 00:57:45,236
# I could be glad #

935
00:57:45,311 --> 00:57:49,145
# All of the while #

936
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:53,174
# I could change the
gray skies to blue #

937
00:57:53,253 --> 00:57:56,586
# If I had you #

938
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:04,023
# I could leave the old days behind #

939
00:58:04,097 --> 00:58:06,827
# Leave all my pals #

940
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,768
# I'd never mind #

941
00:58:10,837 --> 00:58:14,864
# I could start my life all anew #

942
00:58:14,941 --> 00:58:18,570
# If I had you #

943
00:58:21,514 --> 00:58:26,816
# I could climb the
snowcapped mountains #

944
00:58:26,886 --> 00:58:32,119
# Sail the mighty ocean wide #

945
00:58:32,192 --> 00:58:37,687
# I could cross the burning desert #

946
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:43,031
# If I had you by my side #

947
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:47,232
# I could be a king, dear, uncrowned #

948
00:58:47,307 --> 00:58:49,707
# Humble or poor #

949
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:52,609
# Rich or renowned #

950
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:57,976
# There is nothing I couldn't do #

951
00:58:58,051 --> 00:59:02,249
# If I had you ##

952
00:59:08,828 --> 00:59:13,356
- Oh, wow. I can't believe this.
- Shut up, for once.

953
00:59:13,433 --> 00:59:16,368
He's en route to New York now,

954
00:59:16,436 --> 00:59:18,370
and he's wonderful.

955
00:59:18,438 --> 00:59:20,872
It's been, like, a chance meeting,

956
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:23,875
after all these years,
with a true soul mate.

957
00:59:23,943 --> 00:59:25,877
He senses my every need.

958
00:59:25,945 --> 00:59:28,379
It's like he knows what I'm thinking.

959
00:59:28,448 --> 00:59:31,042
- It's like your fantasy come true.
- I... It is.

960
00:59:31,117 --> 00:59:33,608
I-I still can't believe it.

961
00:59:33,686 --> 00:59:37,679
You know, it's... it's not
that he's tall or handsome,

962
00:59:37,757 --> 00:59:41,056
but he's, um... he's magical.

963
00:59:41,127 --> 00:59:45,655
[Von] And he feels me in a way
that no man ever has before.

964
00:59:45,732 --> 00:59:49,998
It's... He's romantic and he's sexy.

965
00:59:50,069 --> 00:59:53,334
I had this dream that
I was in bed with him...

966
00:59:53,406 --> 00:59:56,739
and he was kissing my earlobes...

967
00:59:56,809 --> 01:00:00,870
and then he started
stroking my shoulder blades.

968
01:00:00,947 --> 01:00:03,507
I nearly had an orgasm.

969
01:00:03,583 --> 01:00:06,518
[D.J. Narrating] I had lots
of neat stuff to tell Dad.

970
01:00:06,586 --> 01:00:09,453
He'd really made a big score with Von.

971
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:12,457
But now I've got to stop for a minute,

972
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:15,790
because as much as we humans
like to think we control things,

973
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:18,296
that's not the way it works.

974
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:21,800
Suddenly, with no warning, Grandpa died.

975
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:25,804
It was in his sleep,
peaceful, with no suffering,

976
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:28,466
but it made philosophers of all of us.

977
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:31,476
When your number is
up, your number is up.

978
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:33,808
That's why it's very important...

979
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,973
that we cherish each moment,

980
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:38,244
each moment of our lives,

981
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:40,252
and not smoke.

982
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,254
Smoke?

983
01:00:42,322 --> 01:00:46,258
Wh... I mean, he... Pop
smoked for 70 years, you know.

984
01:00:46,326 --> 01:00:48,760
- Well...
- He never exercised. He ate everything.

985
01:00:48,828 --> 01:00:51,763
He ate cholesterol and, and fatty foods.

986
01:00:51,831 --> 01:00:54,265
He died at a healthy, ripe old age.

987
01:00:54,334 --> 01:00:57,269
I haven't had steak in
so long. I love steak.

988
01:00:57,337 --> 01:00:59,771
- Now you got him talking about food.
- Disgusting.

989
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:02,273
I'd kill for some marbleized meat.

990
01:01:02,342 --> 01:01:07,473
They say six cups of coffee a day
prevents, like, prevents colon cancer.

991
01:01:07,547 --> 01:01:10,414
Last week it was bad for you.

992
01:01:10,483 --> 01:01:13,543
[Steffi] What's it all about? I mean...

993
01:01:13,619 --> 01:01:16,554
What are we doing? We're
rushing, we're rushing.

994
01:01:16,622 --> 01:01:18,556
- Th-That's right.
- Where are we going?

995
01:01:18,624 --> 01:01:21,559
- [Laura Whispers] They're so old.
- Into the void.

996
01:01:21,627 --> 01:01:24,619
That's it. The void is it, you
know. I never believed in God.

997
01:01:24,697 --> 01:01:27,632
- Oh...
- No, I didn't, not even as a little kid.

998
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:30,134
I used to think... I remember this...

999
01:01:30,203 --> 01:01:33,639
...even if He exists, He's done
such a terrible job, - Dad!

1000
01:01:33,706 --> 01:01:36,641
it's a wonder people don't file
a class action suit against Him.

1001
01:01:36,709 --> 01:01:38,643
You shouldn't be talking about...

1002
01:01:38,711 --> 01:01:41,646
There's gotta be some reason we're
here. It can't just be the new physics.

1003
01:01:41,714 --> 01:01:43,648
You gotta believe in something.

1004
01:01:43,716 --> 01:01:45,650
[Bob] The dignity of Man.

1005
01:01:45,718 --> 01:01:48,653
The flat tax, the right to
bear arms and school prayer.

1006
01:01:48,721 --> 01:01:51,656
- If there's nobody out there,
who are they praying to? - Stop fighting.

1007
01:01:51,724 --> 01:01:53,658
- [Steffi] Please don't.
- [All Arguing]

1008
01:01:53,726 --> 01:01:57,492
- Please don't start arguing in
front of Grandpa. - I can't believe you.

1009
01:01:57,563 --> 01:02:01,090
Wait a minute. He wasn't an
atheist. He wasn't a Republican.

1010
01:02:01,167 --> 01:02:04,193
- He wasn't even a Democrat.
- Well, Mom, he must've been something.

1011
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:06,534
- He was a foot fetishist.
- Yeah.

1012
01:02:06,606 --> 01:02:09,541
- It's the only group I remember
him belonging to. - That's true.

1013
01:02:09,609 --> 01:02:11,543
He drove your mother crazy.

1014
01:02:11,611 --> 01:02:14,637
- [Clears Throat]
- Pop, is that you?

1015
01:02:14,714 --> 01:02:17,148
I've got just one message for you.

1016
01:02:17,216 --> 01:02:21,619
You work and work for years and
years, you're always on the go.

1017
01:02:21,687 --> 01:02:25,714
You never take a minute
off. Too busy makin' dough.

1018
01:02:25,792 --> 01:02:30,024
Someday, you say, you'll have
your fun when you're a millionaire.

1019
01:02:30,096 --> 01:02:32,326
# Imagine all the fun you'll have #

1020
01:02:32,398 --> 01:02:34,332
# In your old rocking chair #

1021
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,834
# Enjoy yourself #

1022
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:45,969
# It's later than you think #

1023
01:02:46,045 --> 01:02:48,138
# Enjoy yourself #

1024
01:02:48,214 --> 01:02:50,409
# While you're still in the pink #

1025
01:02:50,483 --> 01:02:54,783
# The years go by as quickly as a wink #

1026
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:56,981
# Enjoy yourself Enjoy yourself #

1027
01:02:57,056 --> 01:02:58,455
# It's later than you think #

1028
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:00,583
# Bum bum-bah-bum
Bum bum-bah-bum #

1029
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:02,423
# Bum-bum-bum
Bum bum bum #

1030
01:03:02,495 --> 01:03:04,486
# Another birthday's here and gone #

1031
01:03:04,564 --> 01:03:06,759
# You've turned another page #

1032
01:03:06,833 --> 01:03:08,926
# And suddenly you realize #

1033
01:03:09,001 --> 01:03:11,128
# That you've reached middle age #

1034
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:13,468
# Just think of all
the fun you've missed #

1035
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:15,473
# It makes you kind of sad #

1036
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:17,600
# It's better to have had your wish #

1037
01:03:17,677 --> 01:03:20,009
# Than to have wished you had #

1038
01:03:55,882 --> 01:03:57,941
- # Enjoy yourself #
- # It's later #

1039
01:03:58,017 --> 01:04:00,076
- # It's later than you think #
- # Later and later #

1040
01:04:00,152 --> 01:04:02,143
- # Enjoy yourself #
- # Even later #

1041
01:04:02,221 --> 01:04:04,382
- # While you're still in the pink #
- # Later and later #

1042
01:04:04,457 --> 01:04:06,516
# The years go by #

1043
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:08,560
# And quickly as a wink #

# It's later than you think ##

1050
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:23,541
That...

1051
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:25,543
was unbelievable.

1052
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:31,172
Just every...

1053
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:34,276
thing you did and...

1054
01:04:34,353 --> 01:04:37,880
all the things you did.

1055
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:41,059
Absolutely perfect.

1056
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:43,561
[Clears Throat] Well,
actually, it wasn't perfect.

1057
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:47,793
There was a moment in there when I
stroked when I should have hickeyed,

1058
01:04:47,867 --> 01:04:50,461
but, you know, I apologize.

1059
01:04:50,536 --> 01:04:52,470
I feel...

1060
01:04:52,538 --> 01:04:54,631
I feel limp. [Sighs]

1061
01:04:54,707 --> 01:04:58,234
You know, I'd really love
you to come to Paris with me.

1062
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:00,245
- I'm serious.
- Yeah?

1063
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:02,247
Paris?

1064
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:04,249
And then Bora Bora.

1065
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:07,252
Well, well, yes, Bora
Bora, but Paris first.

1066
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:10,312
Then we'd work our way down
to a least one of the Boras.

1067
01:05:10,389 --> 01:05:13,017
We can live in your garret.

1068
01:05:13,092 --> 01:05:16,084
Uh, t-technically,
w-when I say "garret"...

1069
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:18,323
I.. It's funny. It is a garret, and yet...

1070
01:05:18,397 --> 01:05:21,798
- And drink wine and eat snails
'til the dawn comes up. - Snails?

1071
01:05:21,867 --> 01:05:24,301
Yeah. Remember?

1072
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:27,806
You said how you also loved waking
up in the middle of the night,

1073
01:05:27,873 --> 01:05:30,808
...sitting in bed eating snails,
drinking wine. - Yes, yes. Yes.

1074
01:05:30,876 --> 01:05:33,071
I said it was such a great coincidence.

1075
01:05:33,145 --> 01:05:35,079
Well, they're... they're mollusks.

1076
01:05:35,147 --> 01:05:37,081
I-I-I love, uh,
a good mollusk.

1077
01:05:37,149 --> 01:05:38,582
[Giggles]

1078
01:05:38,651 --> 01:05:41,586
W-W-What do you mean,
the wedding is off?

1079
01:05:41,654 --> 01:05:44,782
- Exactly what I said. I gave back his ring.
- Why?

1080
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:48,293
Because there's someone else
I can't get out of my mind.

1081
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:51,296
- But y-you're in love with
Holden! - No, Dad, I'm not.

1082
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:55,300
At least I'm not sure I am, and I can't
cheat on him while I figure it out.

1083
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:58,303
- Cheat on Holden? He's gonna
be your husband! - No, Dad!

1084
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:02,307
- In November. I'll show you. I got receipts from
caterers. - Bob, calm your denial mechanism.

1085
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:04,309
It's not that Holden isn't wonderful.

1086
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:07,813
It's just that somebody else has come
into my life and I must see where it goes.

1087
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,747
- It wouldn't be fair to Holden if I didn't.
- Oh, fine! Okay.

1088
01:06:10,816 --> 01:06:13,751
Now that we've bought you
this fabulous wedding dress,

1089
01:06:13,819 --> 01:06:17,255
would you mind telling me who this new
Prince Charming is that suddenly emerged?

1090
01:06:17,323 --> 01:06:20,258
- Well, you don't kn... You do, but not
like I do. - I'm sick.

1091
01:06:20,326 --> 01:06:23,762
- Honey, what's the matter?
- My esophagus is going into spasms.

1092
01:06:23,829 --> 01:06:27,265
- If my necktie goes up and down...
- Look what you're doing to your father.

1093
01:06:27,333 --> 01:06:30,268
Tell me who has come
between you and Holden.

1094
01:06:30,336 --> 01:06:32,770
- Well, he's bright and charming...
- Yeah?

1095
01:06:32,838 --> 01:06:35,773
and rough to the outside,
but that can change.

1096
01:06:35,841 --> 01:06:39,174
- Are you gonna tell us, or is this
like a game show? - [Clears Throat]

1097
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:41,179
You remember Charles Ferry?

1098
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:43,181
- Pardon me?
- Charles Ferry.

1099
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:46,184
For a minute I thought
she said Charles Ferry.

1100
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:49,187
- Now my esophagus is starting to move.
- Charles Ferry?

1101
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:51,189
- Honey!
- The escaped convict?

1102
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:54,192
- Skylar! - Ex-convict.
He has a college degree.

1103
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,194
No, Skylar, let me tell you something.

1104
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:59,197
You're having a psychotic
episode. You need help!

1105
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:02,200
- You need shock treatment, or
industrial-strength Prozac. - Calm down.

1106
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:04,202
Mom, you understand.

1107
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:07,205
There is something incredibly
animalistic about him.

1108
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,707
- We'll turn him over to the zoo.
- Oh, honey.

1109
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:13,211
- And yet he's like a child.
- Okay, we'll make it the children's zoo.

1110
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,713
- He's a criminal!
- Mom, I'm shocked.

1111
01:07:15,781 --> 01:07:18,716
You've done nothing but
sing his praises for months.

1112
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:20,718
Well, yes, as a social symbol.

1113
01:07:20,786 --> 01:07:23,721
But as an actual person
to be with my child?

1114
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:27,520
- How are you going to go out with this man?
- Guys, get out of here.

1115
01:07:27,593 --> 01:07:30,027
You can't get behind
him. He won't let you!

1116
01:07:30,096 --> 01:07:32,530
You try to scratch his
back, he'll knife you!

1117
01:07:32,598 --> 01:07:35,533
[Skylar] Under all that veneer
is a very soulful young attorney.

1118
01:07:35,601 --> 01:07:38,536
In fact, I was hoping you might
find a place for him in your firm.

1119
01:07:38,604 --> 01:07:41,539
[Bob] I'll make him treasurer.
He can share a room with Holden.

1120
01:07:41,607 --> 01:07:44,542
Speaking as a woman, Holden
can be very animal too.

1121
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:47,545
- Yes, Mom, but it's of the gerbil family.
- Oh, that's not...

1122
01:07:47,613 --> 01:07:50,548
- Get out of here!
- As your father, I forbid you...

1123
01:07:50,616 --> 01:07:52,550
to see this man Charles Ferry.

1124
01:07:52,618 --> 01:07:54,552
You will marry Holden as planned.

1125
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:58,147
As head of this house, I
command it! I decree it!

Thou shalt wed thy intended!

- Okay, come on, let's have...
- That's it.

1128
01:08:02,394 --> 01:08:05,659
Let's get a drink. You're
sounding tiresomely Biblical.

1129
01:08:05,731 --> 01:08:09,599
"Tiresomely Biblical"? What is
this, Noel Coward with hockey?

1130
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:13,104
- She's not gonna waste her life like this
on a gangster. - Oh, she's a grown woman!

1131
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:15,106
- You!
- What?

1132
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:18,109
- You got him out of jail!
- This is my fault now?

1133
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:20,873
- [Sobbing]
- Honey, what? What's wrong?

1134
01:08:20,946 --> 01:08:24,382
Jeffrey Vandermost asked
Lane out and not me.

1135
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:26,384
- Ohh.
- Oh, my God!

1136
01:08:26,452 --> 01:08:29,387
How am I gonna face
Arnold and Lynn Spence?

1137
01:08:29,455 --> 01:08:31,389
Is that all you're thinking about?

1138
01:08:31,457 --> 01:08:33,391
We bought a race horse together.

1139
01:08:33,459 --> 01:08:35,893
He's gonna want to cut it in half!

1140
01:08:35,961 --> 01:08:38,896
We both liked him, and today
he asked if we could talk alone,

1141
01:08:38,964 --> 01:08:40,898
so I got all excited.

1142
01:08:40,966 --> 01:08:44,595
And then he asked me if I thought
Lane would go out with him...

1143
01:08:44,670 --> 01:08:47,104
if he asked her to a
dance in Connecticut...

1144
01:08:47,173 --> 01:08:49,607
and that he had a mad crush on her.

1145
01:08:49,675 --> 01:08:53,111
Ohh. These things happen. Feelings
are feelings and sometimes...

# I'm thru with love
I'll never fall again #

1147

What are you saying? You're 14
years old. You'll fall again.

1148
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:04,255
Oh, you guys, I am so sorry.

1149
01:09:04,323 --> 01:09:08,123

[D.J. Narrating] While Skylar was breaking
up with Holden, - ## [Continues]

1157
01:09:32,351 --> 01:09:35,582
I broke up with Ken, the
guy I met at the airport,

1158
01:09:35,654 --> 01:09:37,645
because I met this rap singer.

1159
01:09:37,723 --> 01:09:41,352
I mean, this guy is just
so talented and sexy...

1160
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:44,362

Um, Charles, where did you get
the money to pay for everything,

1173
01:10:30,042 --> 01:10:32,101
and... and this car?

1174

Uh, well, you know, loans.

Oh, this is a great idea to
take a walk here. It's beautiful.

Oh, good.

I just thought you'd wanna walk
around a little, see the fall leaves.

- I can't imagine you'd wanna work in the
restaurant forever. - You're right.

1185
01:11:05,744 --> 01:11:09,305
Work all day for what? A few
lousy bucks. I got bigger plans.

1186
01:11:09,381 --> 01:11:12,544
- Like pursuing a law career.
- What?

1187
01:11:12,618 --> 01:11:14,552
A lawyer?

[D.J. Narrating] In October, Von
finally got up the nerve and left Greg.

1213
01:12:33,699 --> 01:12:37,362
She bought a ticket on Air France
and took the first plane to Paris.

1214

By this time Dad had given up
his flat on the Left Bank...

1215
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:42,039
and moved into a place...

1216
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:46,043
he knew would be straight out of
Von's fantasy of a Parisian apartment.

In addition to taking guitar lessons,

for an old portable typewriter.

she had given him a hard time.

There's nothing to be alarmed about.

There was blockage in an artery, but
it's all been dissolved, so he's fine.

- He's totally fine? There's no problem?
- Oh, no. Hundred percent.

occurred some time ago, perhaps a year,

so if he's exhibited any
strange or weird behavior,

1277
01:16:04,076 --> 01:16:08,172
it's probably because his brain
wasn't getting enough oxygen.

[D.J. Narrating] And
wouldn't you know it,

as soon as his brain
started functioning properly,

Scott resigned from the Young
Conservative Republican Club...

1281

just as proud as can be.

Remember I told you New York was
the most beautiful in the fall?

What I really meant was the
winter, at least when it snows.

01:16:38,143 --> 01:16:40,634
You know, when Christmas
comes we don't...

1288
01:16:40,712 --> 01:16:44,341
We're not the kind of family that
hangs stockings or sings carols.

1289
01:16:44,416 --> 01:16:46,850
We don't have a goose or anything.

1290
01:16:46,918 --> 01:16:50,979
What we do do is head right for Paris and
spend our Christmas holiday at the Ritz.

1291
01:17:37,602 --> 01:17:39,536
[Steffi] Here, honey,
put your finger here.

1292
01:17:39,604 --> 01:17:41,538
Do it, hard.

1293
01:17:41,606 --> 01:17:43,540
- Well, he has a
fever. - Ahh-choo!

1294
01:17:43,608 --> 01:17:45,542
It's a cold.

1295
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:49,046
I told you you should've put on some dry
clothes after you fell in the fountain.

1296
01:17:49,114 --> 01:17:51,548
You go without me. I'll be all right.

1297
01:17:51,616 --> 01:17:53,550
We don't want to go without you.

1298
01:17:53,618 --> 01:17:56,553
The Marx Brothers' are your
favorite movies. Mom, I feel so bad.

1299
01:17:56,621 --> 01:17:59,556
- He should stay home if he feels sick.
- I'm gonna stay home.

1300
01:17:59,624 --> 01:18:04,357
I'm so excited; I'm meeting this
guy named Guy, or this guy named Guy.

1301
01:18:04,429 --> 01:18:06,363
- Cool. Congratulations.
- Here, Dad.

1302
01:18:06,431 --> 01:18:09,298
- I brought you some tea.
- Oh, great. Thank you.

1303
01:18:09,368 --> 01:18:11,802
- [Doorbell Rings]
- It's not gonna keep me awake?

1304
01:18:11,870 --> 01:18:14,805
No, it's completely herbal.
It's peppermint flavored.

1305
01:18:14,873 --> 01:18:17,433
- Hello, Joe. -
Joe! - Hi, Dad!

1306
01:18:17,509 --> 01:18:21,741
Oh, I'd say hello, but I'm sick and,
you know, you always catch everything.

1307
01:18:21,813 --> 01:18:24,247
- What happened?
- What's wrong?

1308
01:18:24,316 --> 01:18:26,250
- I'm not going tonight.
- [Girls] Why not?

1309
01:18:26,318 --> 01:18:28,411
- I knew it.
- What's wrong, Dad?

1310
01:18:28,487 --> 01:18:30,421
- Von left me.
- What?

1311
01:18:30,489 --> 01:18:32,423
What happened?

1312
01:18:32,491 --> 01:18:35,927
I have no idea, but she's
on her way back to New York.

1313
01:18:35,994 --> 01:18:38,929
When she first came,
everything was perfect.

1314
01:18:38,997 --> 01:18:42,626
She said it was like a
dream had come true for her.

1315
01:18:42,701 --> 01:18:45,727
And then suddenly, this morning...

1316
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:50,298
Um, I want to go back home...

1317
01:18:50,375 --> 01:18:52,309
to Greg.

1318
01:18:53,678 --> 01:18:55,612
Really?

1319
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:58,114
I don't know what's wrong with me.

1320
01:18:58,183 --> 01:19:00,151
Since when has, uh, this happened?

1321
01:19:00,218 --> 01:19:02,482
I don't know.

1322
01:19:02,554 --> 01:19:04,613
Well, why?

1323
01:19:04,689 --> 01:19:06,623
I... I... [Clears Throat]
I don't know.

1324
01:19:06,691 --> 01:19:09,125
I don't know how to explain it, exactly.

1325
01:19:09,194 --> 01:19:11,628
Well, just tell me. You know, just...

1326
01:19:11,696 --> 01:19:15,223
Well, it's not that I don't
think that you're great. Okay?

1327
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:17,359
- Um, I think you're great.
- Yeah?

1328
01:19:17,436 --> 01:19:22,032
Um, just, for years, you know,
I've been married to Greg,

1329
01:19:22,107 --> 01:19:24,598
and, and he can be difficult,

1330
01:19:24,676 --> 01:19:29,636
and we've had our ups
and downs, certainly.

1331
01:19:29,714 --> 01:19:32,649
- Since when did you have all these...
- I don't know.

1332
01:19:32,717 --> 01:19:37,484
It's just, I've... I've
always had this fantasy, okay,

1333
01:19:37,556 --> 01:19:39,490
that, um...

1334
01:19:39,558 --> 01:19:42,652
that one day I would
meet the perfect man...

1335
01:19:42,727 --> 01:19:46,458
and he would fulfill my
dreams and I would have...

1336
01:19:46,531 --> 01:19:48,965
the perfect life.

1337
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:52,162
That fantasy, I think,

1338
01:19:52,237 --> 01:19:57,504
always sort of, um, was part of this
dissatisfaction that I had with Greg...

1339
01:19:57,576 --> 01:19:59,510
and, and my life.

1340
01:19:59,578 --> 01:20:03,173
And then you came along
and you seemed to know...

1341
01:20:03,248 --> 01:20:06,513
every secret thing about me.

1342
01:20:08,487 --> 01:20:11,285
Let me put it this way.

1343
01:20:11,356 --> 01:20:14,291
I have seen my dream come true,

1344
01:20:14,359 --> 01:20:17,886
and my fantasy no longer tortures me.

1345
01:20:17,963 --> 01:20:20,397
I can deal with it.

1346
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:25,292
Yeah, but that's so neurotic.

1347
01:20:25,370 --> 01:20:28,305
Well, I know. I'm crazy.

1348
01:20:29,541 --> 01:20:32,476
Well, but supposing I said to you...

1349
01:20:32,544 --> 01:20:34,978
that none of this was really true;

1350
01:20:35,046 --> 01:20:38,641
that this was all a facade
that I've been putting on;

1351
01:20:38,717 --> 01:20:42,949
that-that-that somehow
I had, you know, access...

1352
01:20:43,021 --> 01:20:46,582
to your deepest feelings and your
needs and all your secret thoughts...

1353
01:20:46,658 --> 01:20:49,593
and, and I've been, I've
been playing this character...

1354
01:20:49,661 --> 01:20:52,129
just to, just to win you over,

1355
01:20:52,197 --> 01:20:55,132
to get you to like me, make you happy.

1356
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,862
If that's what you told me,

1357
01:20:57,936 --> 01:21:00,370
then I'd say you were crazy.

1358
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:05,671
So that's exactly why I'm
not going tonight. You know?

1359
01:21:05,744 --> 01:21:08,679
Instead, I-I have plans
to go to Napoleon's tomb.

1360
01:21:08,747 --> 01:21:13,013
- I'm gonna lie down next to him. That's
Christmas Eve for me. - That's so sad.

1361
01:21:13,084 --> 01:21:16,019
- The women you pick.
- No, you're going out.

1362
01:21:16,087 --> 01:21:18,021
- Aaaaah-choo! -
Somebody's gotta take Mom.

1363
01:21:18,089 --> 01:21:21,024
- He's so sick.
- You're too sick to go out this evening?

1364
01:21:21,092 --> 01:21:24,528
- I'm fine, as long as I don't move
my eyeballs. - He has a 101 temperature.

1365
01:21:24,596 --> 01:21:27,531
- You're not going anywhere tonight.
- But I'm not in a Groucho mood.

1366
01:21:27,599 --> 01:21:29,533
- Aw, come on. You'll love it. Go.
- It's Christmas Eve.

1367
01:21:29,601 --> 01:21:31,535
It's Paris. There's a ball.

1368
01:21:31,603 --> 01:21:35,539
Besides, you're on the committee that
arranged the party for the Cinematheque.

1369
01:21:35,607 --> 01:21:39,270
- You have to go. Enjoy yourself.
- I'll go for a couple hours.

1370
01:21:39,344 --> 01:21:42,279
I gotta stay here, but
there's no reason you don't go.

1371
01:21:42,347 --> 01:21:44,315
It's later than you think.

1410
01:23:44,569 --> 01:23:47,663
- ## [Orchestra] - Do you remember
our first Christmas Eve in Paris,

1411
01:23:47,739 --> 01:23:50,299
the month before we got married?

1412
01:23:50,375 --> 01:23:52,309
I do, because that was...

1413
01:23:52,377 --> 01:23:55,813
that was when I knew that someday I
would absolutely have to live here.

1414
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:58,815
Mmm. I remember it
like it was yesterday.

1415
01:24:00,218 --> 01:24:03,654
I don't wanna panic you.
That was decades ago.

1416
01:24:03,722 --> 01:24:06,657
- I mean, decades, not, not...
- I know, I know. It was decades ago.

1417
01:24:06,725 --> 01:24:09,592
Do you remember that
cafe we used to go to?

1418
01:24:09,661 --> 01:24:13,097
Cafe Therese, or whatever,
with the cats? Do you remember?

1419
01:24:13,164 --> 01:24:15,928
- Now I'm gonna tell you the truth.
- Yeah.

1420
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,436
I hated that cat. I
mean, I-I-I hated...

1421
01:24:19,504 --> 01:24:22,940
Well, maybe that's why you were
scratching yourself all night.

1422
01:24:23,007 --> 01:24:26,443
Was I scratching myself all night?
Is that what you noticed about me?

1423
01:24:26,511 --> 01:24:28,445
I certainly... I certainly did.

1424
01:24:28,513 --> 01:24:31,448
Well, I hated that cat.
I couldn't stand it.

1425
01:24:31,516 --> 01:24:34,952
But now that cafe is right around
the corner from where I live.

1426
01:24:35,019 --> 01:24:37,954
- You're joking. - Why would
I joke about something like that?

1427
01:24:38,022 --> 01:24:41,287
- You wanna go have a drink there?
- No.

1428
01:24:41,359 --> 01:24:43,452
- Why not?
- Because we're drinking here.

1429
01:24:43,528 --> 01:24:47,464
Well, yeah, but... We can take our
mustaches off. Nobody's gonna know.

1430
01:24:47,532 --> 01:24:50,626
- What, are you having a nostalgic,
a sudden... - Yeah, I'm having a thing.

1431
01:24:50,702 --> 01:24:53,637
Sue me. I just thought
it would be kind of fun.

1432
01:24:53,705 --> 01:24:57,641
- No, we can't sneak out... - Come on,
we'll take our mustaches off. No problem.

1433
01:24:57,709 --> 01:25:00,143
- That I'd like to do.
- Wouldn't you? Me too.

1434
01:25:00,211 --> 01:25:03,703
I never thought I'd hear you
say, "Take my mustache off."

1435
01:25:03,782 --> 01:25:05,716
Please. [Laughing]

1436
01:25:05,784 --> 01:25:08,651
Anyway, we'll go. I-I'm
a little... I feel good.

1437
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:11,655
I've had three glasses of
champagne. I feel fabulous.

1438
01:25:11,723 --> 01:25:15,318
- Let's go see this place. - Yeah,
but y-you really wanna sneak out?

1439
01:25:15,393 --> 01:25:18,829
I do. It's not... We snuck
out before. Do you remember?

1440
01:25:18,897 --> 01:25:22,594
Remember that party with the
Hamilton-Wainwrights? It was so boring.

1441
01:25:22,667 --> 01:25:24,601
Oh, yes. Yes.

1442
01:25:24,669 --> 01:25:29,197
- I remember because we snuck out
through the toilet window. - Right!

1443
01:25:29,274 --> 01:25:32,903
The guy was singing "Climb Every
Mountain," and we couldn't bear it.

1444
01:25:32,977 --> 01:25:35,912
You knocked over the punch
bowl, if I remember correctly.

1445
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:39,916
Yes, but you were the one who let out
the piercing shriek that got us caught.

1446
01:25:39,984 --> 01:25:43,112
Oh, and do you remember how
we made love? You know...

1447
01:25:43,188 --> 01:25:45,622
- Ooh. Oh, I dropped...
- You dropped your cigar.

1448
01:25:45,690 --> 01:25:48,625
I know. Give me my cigar.
I dropped the cigar and...

1449
01:25:48,693 --> 01:25:50,627
- You're so drunk.
- [Giggling]

1450
01:25:50,695 --> 01:25:53,289
I remember us making love, I, uh...

1451
01:25:53,364 --> 01:25:56,390
- Candlelight. - I remember
the candles; I remember the hotel.

1452
01:25:56,467 --> 01:26:00,028
I just don't remember you, unless
you were the one who was under me.

1453
01:26:00,104 --> 01:26:03,403
- Oh, now you're in character.
- I don't know where I am.

1454
01:26:03,474 --> 01:26:05,908
- I'm... I'm lost.
- Come on, let's go.

1455
01:26:05,977 --> 01:26:08,844
No, it's cold out there.
Our coats are in the car.

1456
01:26:08,913 --> 01:26:10,847
Forget it. It's a warm night.

1457
01:26:10,915 --> 01:26:12,849
Come on. Pretend you're young.

1458
01:26:12,917 --> 01:26:15,852
- Well, I could for you.
- [Giggling]

1459
01:26:18,089 --> 01:26:20,023
You're better off without her.

1460
01:26:20,091 --> 01:26:23,527
How do you know? You never met her.

1461
01:26:23,595 --> 01:26:25,529
I know you.

1462
01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:27,531
Yeah. So? What does that mean?

1463
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:30,534
A good psychiatrist
that listened to you...

1464
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:33,628
would think that every time I get
involved with a woman, you get jealous.

1465
01:26:33,705 --> 01:26:35,639
- [Giggles]
- What are you laughing?

1466
01:26:35,707 --> 01:26:39,643
"Jealous." Joe, I just wish you'd pick
somebody that could make you happy.

1467
01:26:39,711 --> 01:26:42,009
- Like who?
- I made you happy.

1468
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:45,015
- Yeah... I didn't say you didn't.
- I made you very happy.

1469
01:26:45,083 --> 01:26:48,143
- Hey... - When we weren't,
you know, at each other's throats.

1470
01:26:48,219 --> 01:26:51,746
- Does this ring a bell? This is
why I took you here. - [Gasps]

1471
01:26:51,823 --> 01:26:55,054
- Does this mean anything to you?
- Is this... Is this where we...

1472
01:26:55,126 --> 01:26:58,061
This is it, yes. That's why
I dragged you all over town.

1473
01:26:58,129 --> 01:27:00,427
Oh! Ohh! Oh, my God!

1474
01:27:00,498 --> 01:27:03,433
- You remember this?
- This is where we stayed up all night.

1475
01:27:03,501 --> 01:27:07,096
I know. I held you in my
arms 'til the light came up.

1476
01:27:07,171 --> 01:27:09,639
- Do you remember that? Do you
remember that song? - Yeah, I do.

1477
01:27:09,707 --> 01:27:13,143
'Cause I still sing that song.
I first heard it from you.

1478
01:27:13,211 --> 01:27:15,702
That was the first time. Remember?

1479
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:18,647
# I'm thru with love #

1480
01:27:18,716 --> 01:27:21,685
# I'll never fall again #

1481
01:27:21,753 --> 01:27:24,813
# Said adieu to love #

1482
01:27:24,889 --> 01:27:27,983
# Don't ever call again #

1483
01:27:28,059 --> 01:27:31,153
# For I must have you #

1484
01:27:31,229 --> 01:27:33,163
# Or no one #

1485
01:27:34,699 --> 01:27:39,227
# And so I'm thru with love #

1486
01:27:40,538 --> 01:27:43,302
# I've locked my heart #

1487
01:27:43,374 --> 01:27:46,502
# I'll keep my feelings there #

1488
01:27:46,577 --> 01:27:49,205
# I have stocked my heart #

1489
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:52,147
# With icy frigid air #

1490
01:27:52,216 --> 01:27:55,379
# And I mean to care #

1491
01:27:55,453 --> 01:27:58,013
# For no one #

1492
01:27:59,424 --> 01:28:03,918
# Because I'm thru with love #

1493
01:28:05,430 --> 01:28:11,062
# Why did you lead me
to think you could care #

1494
01:28:11,135 --> 01:28:16,505
# You didn't need me
for you had your share #

1495
01:28:16,574 --> 01:28:21,443
# Of friends around you
to hound you and swear #

1496
01:28:21,512 --> 01:28:24,845
# With deep emotion #

1497
01:28:24,916 --> 01:28:29,080
# Devotion to you #

1498
01:28:29,153 --> 01:28:32,088
# Good-bye to spring #

1499
01:28:32,156 --> 01:28:35,148
# And all it meant to me #

1500
01:28:35,226 --> 01:28:38,354
# It can never bring #

1501
01:28:38,429 --> 01:28:41,762
# The things that used to be #

1502
01:28:41,833 --> 01:28:45,360
# For I must have you #

1503
01:28:45,436 --> 01:28:48,530
# Or no one #

1504
01:28:50,141 --> 01:28:53,975
# And so I'm thru #

1505
01:28:54,045 --> 01:28:58,948
# With love ##

1506
01:30:50,228 --> 01:30:54,164
You know, over the years I often
wondered what would have happened...

1507
01:30:54,232 --> 01:30:56,166
had we stayed together.

1508
01:30:57,969 --> 01:31:00,665
That's something we're never gonna know.

1509
01:31:01,839 --> 01:31:03,773
We've managed to produce...

1510
01:31:03,841 --> 01:31:05,775
a fabulous daughter, though.

1511
01:31:05,843 --> 01:31:08,277
- I mean, she is
unbelievable. - Mm-hmm.

1512
01:31:08,346 --> 01:31:11,042
She's got your looks, fortunately,

1513
01:31:11,115 --> 01:31:14,551
and my... my magic personality.

1514
01:31:14,619 --> 01:31:17,053
- Yeah, she is wonderful.
- She's great.

1515
01:31:17,121 --> 01:31:20,613
And-And you've been very happy with
Bob, so that's been a good thing.

1516
01:31:20,691 --> 01:31:23,125
- Oh, he's wonderful.
- I think he's great.

1517
01:31:23,194 --> 01:31:26,630
I don't think you could've done
better. I think he's a fabulous guy.

1518
01:31:26,697 --> 01:31:29,632
Of course there have been
a few times, you will admit,

1519
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:32,635
that, uh, you did call
me in dire emergency...

1520
01:31:32,703 --> 01:31:35,638
and I had to come by and bail you out.

1521
01:31:35,706 --> 01:31:38,641
- I know you did.
- Two major fights with Bob, I remember,

1522
01:31:38,709 --> 01:31:42,645
and one disgusting lump that
turned out to be completely benign,

1523
01:31:42,713 --> 01:31:45,147
though you were panicked beyond belief.

1524
01:31:45,216 --> 01:31:48,652
- You were there for me.
That's the main thing. - And you for me.

1525
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:50,653
And I appreciate it.

1526
01:31:50,721 --> 01:31:53,656
I think, actually, that
we-we've been better friends...

1527
01:31:53,724 --> 01:31:55,658
than, than, than husband and wife.

1528
01:31:55,726 --> 01:31:57,990
Yeah, probably we have.

1529
01:31:58,062 --> 01:32:01,088
But, you know, nobody made
me laugh the way you did, Joe.

1530
01:32:01,165 --> 01:32:04,100
I love Bob with all my
heart. It isn't that.

1531
01:32:04,168 --> 01:32:08,537
It's just that you could always,
you know, you could push that button.

1532
01:32:08,606 --> 01:32:11,598
- Why is that so important?
- I don't know.

1533
01:32:11,676 --> 01:32:14,440
I don't know. Maybe we're crazy.

1534
01:32:14,512 --> 01:32:16,446
[Giggling]

1535
01:32:17,515 --> 01:32:19,449
[Sighs]

1536
01:32:19,517 --> 01:32:23,112
So, did that girl that dumped
you today, did she make you laugh?

1537
01:32:23,187 --> 01:32:28,124
I don't know, I... I
have to put that behind.

1538
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:31,294
You know.

1539
01:32:32,964 --> 01:32:36,400
- Funny how life goes.
- It's amazing. Amazing.

1540
01:33:04,161 --> 01:33:06,254
Let's go. It's late.

1541
01:33:06,330 --> 01:33:08,696
It's definitely late.

1542
01:33:08,766 --> 01:33:10,700
Christmas Eve and late.

1543
01:33:10,768 --> 01:33:12,702
Let's go.

1544
01:33:14,071 --> 01:33:16,972
# Everyone says I love you #

1545
01:33:17,041 --> 01:33:20,499
# The cop on the corner
and the burglar too #

1546
01:33:20,578 --> 01:33:22,773
- ## [Continues]
- [D.J. Narrating] Christmas Eve in Paris.

1547
01:33:22,847 --> 01:33:24,781
What a year.

1548
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:28,114
And that sort of brings
us to the end of our story.

1549
01:33:28,185 --> 01:33:31,120
I told Skylar someone should
write it up as a movie.

1550
01:33:31,188 --> 01:33:35,591
She said, " Better make it into a
musical, or no one's gonna believe it."

1551
01:33:35,660 --> 01:33:39,994
By the way, that night
I met a terrific guy.

1552
01:33:40,064 --> 01:33:42,794
I mean, talk about sexy.

1553
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:46,030
# There are only eight little letters #

1554
01:33:46,103 --> 01:33:50,130
# In the phrase you'll find #

1555
01:33:50,207 --> 01:33:52,801
# But they mean a lot more #

1556
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:57,541
# Than all the other words combined #

1557
01:33:57,615 --> 01:34:01,051
# Everywhere the whole world through #

1558
01:34:01,118 --> 01:34:04,747
# The king in the palace
and the peasant too #

1559
01:34:04,822 --> 01:34:08,087
# The tiger in the jungle
and the monk' in the zoo #

1560
01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:10,457
# Says I love you #

1561
01:34:19,503 --> 01:34:22,734
# The preacher in the pulpit
and the man in the pew #

1562
01:34:22,807 --> 01:34:25,037
# Says I love you #

1563
01:34:34,118 --> 01:34:37,451
# The captain and the sailor
and the rest of the crew #

1564
01:34:37,521 --> 01:34:39,853
# Says I love you #

1565
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:59,835
# Everywhere the whole world through #

1566
01:34:59,910 --> 01:35:03,437
# The king in the palace
and the peasant too #

1567
01:35:03,514 --> 01:35:07,348
# The tiger in the jungle
and the monk' in the zoo #

1568
01:35:07,418 --> 01:35:09,852
# Says I love you #
