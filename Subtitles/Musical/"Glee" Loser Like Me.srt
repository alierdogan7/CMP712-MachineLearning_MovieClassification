1
00:00:15,095 --> 00:00:17,196
<i>Oh, look.</i>

2
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,365
Rachel Berry was
great on Broadway

3
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:21,967
and maybe she can work on TV,

4
00:00:22,002 --> 00:00:23,969
but the show and her performance

5
00:00:24,004 --> 00:00:25,971
is the kind of thing
that ends careers,

6
00:00:26,006 --> 00:00:27,072
not starts them.

7
00:00:27,107 --> 00:00:28,787
I said I only wanted
to hear the good ones.

8
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:30,209
Well, that was a good one.

9
00:00:30,243 --> 00:00:32,645
It says maybe
you can work in TV.

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,880
Rachel, it's Lee.

11
00:00:34,915 --> 00:00:35,915
Oh! Lee.
Oh, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:37,750
Uh, I've met you before.
Nancy.

13
00:00:37,784 --> 00:00:39,385
Yeah.
Yes. You know, um...

14
00:00:39,419 --> 00:00:40,753
I'm a publicist, Oh...

15
00:00:40,787 --> 00:00:42,087
and, uh, give me a buzz, okay?

16
00:00:42,122 --> 00:00:43,122
- Okay. Well, thank you for this.
- Rachel.

17
00:00:43,156 --> 00:00:45,036
Congratulations on that baby.

18
00:00:47,227 --> 00:00:48,694
Oh, yeah.

19
00:00:51,598 --> 00:00:53,566
Rachel, I have some bad news.

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,967
I have been fired.

21
00:00:56,703 --> 00:00:58,804
Apparently, I was right

22
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:01,774
that people want to see
live TV shows...

23
00:01:01,808 --> 00:01:02,975
just not this one.

24
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:04,777
I think we are the first show

25
00:01:04,811 --> 00:01:07,746
in history to get a zero share.

26
00:01:07,781 --> 00:01:09,415
Well, do you think that
if we can get more people

27
00:01:09,449 --> 00:01:10,583
to watch the second episode...

28
00:01:10,617 --> 00:01:13,586
If we were to do
another episode,

29
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,155
there would be protestors
from UNICEF,

30
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:18,791
the ADL, the NAACP,

31
00:01:18,825 --> 00:01:21,127
PETA... I mean,
my BlackBerry

32
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:23,596
is buzzing with angry e-mails
from NAMBLA.

33
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,365
I think that you
actually found a way

34
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:28,868
to offend every
special interest group

35
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:30,236
in this country.

36
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,571
And I don't want to point
fingers, but I have to.

37
00:01:32,606 --> 00:01:34,006
At you, because
you're the face of it.

38
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,274
Okay?

39
00:01:35,308 --> 00:01:37,576
I don't know
what I'm going to do.

40
00:01:37,611 --> 00:01:39,378
I've got two families to feed.

41
00:01:39,412 --> 00:01:40,880
Actually, I do know
what I'm going to do.

42
00:01:40,914 --> 00:01:43,115
I'm just going to end up
running another network.

43
00:01:45,051 --> 00:01:47,019
Mr. Paulblatt, I'm...
I'm so sorry.

44
00:01:47,053 --> 00:01:49,188
I just... I can't imagine
how you feel.

45
00:01:49,222 --> 00:01:51,390
Oh, well, you should, be...

46
00:01:51,424 --> 00:01:53,058
because you're also fired.

47
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:55,294
<i>That's So Rachel</i>
has been canceled.

48
00:01:55,328 --> 00:01:57,329
I mean...

49
00:01:57,364 --> 00:01:59,532
I'm not the only one
going down with this ship.

50
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:01,634
No. I mean,
unlike me,

51
00:02:01,668 --> 00:02:02,935
I would highly doubt

52
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:04,270
that you ever work
in television again.

53
00:02:04,304 --> 00:02:05,638
That's so rude.
I shouldn't have said that.

54
00:02:05,672 --> 00:02:07,072
Not "highly doubt."
I'd be surprised.

55
00:02:07,107 --> 00:02:08,307
Not "surprised."
Floored.

56
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:09,708
Wh... I'm...

57
00:02:09,743 --> 00:02:11,510
What-what-what am I
supposed to do?

58
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:14,880
Do what everyone
who just failed miserably does:

59
00:02:14,915 --> 00:02:17,416
Blame everyone else.

60
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,286
And then go home.

61
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,994
I don't even know

90
00:05:12,192 --> 00:05:14,126
Baby...

91
00:05:14,161 --> 00:05:16,362
Oh...

92
00:05:16,396 --> 00:05:18,030
Oh, thank God.

93
00:05:18,065 --> 00:05:20,545
What's going on?
Where's Dad?

94
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,201
Sweetie...

95
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:32,812
Dad and I are getting divorced.

96
00:05:32,846 --> 00:05:34,713
What?

97
00:05:34,748 --> 00:05:35,915
N... no.

98
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:37,283
No, this isn't happening.

99
00:05:37,317 --> 00:05:39,018
Oh, my God, I feel like I died
and now I'm in hell.

100
00:05:39,052 --> 00:05:42,488
It's been bad for a long time.

101
00:05:42,522 --> 00:05:45,825
We agreed to wait to tell you

102
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:47,793
until you came out of seclusion.

103
00:05:47,828 --> 00:05:49,395
You had enough on your plate.

104
00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:53,999
I'll tell you more over dinner.

105
00:05:57,204 --> 00:05:58,437
I, um...

106
00:06:00,574 --> 00:06:02,875
I don't know how long
I'm going to be staying.

107
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:04,210
Is that all right?

108
00:06:04,244 --> 00:06:07,246
You can stay with me
as long as you want.

109
00:06:08,682 --> 00:06:10,383
But we put the house
on the market

110
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:11,584
a couple weeks ago.

111
00:06:15,622 --> 00:06:19,725
They say you have
to lose everything...

112
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,761
before you can really
find yourself.

113
00:06:24,931 --> 00:06:27,411
One soy latte, please.

114
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:29,402
Oh, my God,

115
00:06:29,436 --> 00:06:31,737
it's William McKinley's
own Rachel Berry!

116
00:06:31,772 --> 00:06:33,873
Oh, no, my God,
no, please. No. Shh.

117
00:06:33,907 --> 00:06:35,641
You can't hide from me.

118
00:06:35,676 --> 00:06:38,744
I work her now, since Sue
cut my janitor's wages.

119
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:40,746
Oh, this soy latte's on me.

120
00:06:40,781 --> 00:06:42,281
May I please have my card back?

121
00:06:42,316 --> 00:06:43,616
No matter how bad
things have been for me,

122
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,718
but your humiliation
makes me see

123
00:06:45,752 --> 00:06:47,032
that things can
always get worse.

124
00:06:47,054 --> 00:06:48,120
That's terrible.

125
00:06:48,155 --> 00:06:49,288
Gratitude.

126
00:06:49,323 --> 00:06:50,623
Great. Well.

127
00:06:50,657 --> 00:06:52,024
Might as well just take
all this off now.

128
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:53,059
What was that?

129
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,061
You know, it's just
the story of my life.

130
00:06:55,095 --> 00:06:57,015
All I've ever wanted
is to come home

131
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,297
and have everyone know my name,

132
00:06:58,332 --> 00:06:59,899
and now they do,
but only because

133
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:03,903
I was involved in the worst
television show in history.

134
00:07:03,937 --> 00:07:06,872
No one has heard
from you in months.

135
00:07:06,907 --> 00:07:08,708
Well, that's because
I went into hiding.

136
00:07:08,742 --> 00:07:10,076
Yeah.

137
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,677
But you know, I'm good now.

138
00:07:11,712 --> 00:07:13,279
I'm good, and...

139
00:07:13,313 --> 00:07:17,249
I'm getting my life
back together and...

140
00:07:17,284 --> 00:07:19,285
and everything is good.

141
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:23,589
Well, I'm gonna help you
figure this out.

142
00:07:23,624 --> 00:07:25,324
Thanks.

143
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:27,627
I just...

144
00:07:27,661 --> 00:07:29,101
I don't understand.
Why are you back?

145
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:31,263
Are you visiting
family? Where's Kurt?

146
00:07:31,298 --> 00:07:33,099
Uh...

147
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:34,600
wow, you really
have been in hiding.

148
00:07:34,635 --> 00:07:36,002
Uh...

149
00:07:36,036 --> 00:07:37,336
Rach, Kurt and I broke up.

150
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:38,504
What?

151
00:07:38,538 --> 00:07:41,974
Yeah, it...
got pretty rough

152
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:43,442
after everyone left
and it was just...

153
00:07:43,477 --> 00:07:45,244
him and me, alone in the loft.

154
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:48,180
I guess we're "too young."

155
00:07:48,215 --> 00:07:50,116
Everybody says this is
exactly what happens

156
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,450
to high school relationships

157
00:07:51,485 --> 00:07:53,519
after the first year
of college, but I...

158
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:54,713
I thought we were different.

159
00:07:54,721 --> 00:07:56,522
I'm really sorry.

160
00:07:56,556 --> 00:07:58,691
I got super depressed

161
00:07:58,725 --> 00:08:00,026
after we broke up,

162
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,395
and, uh...

163
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:05,464
my schoolwork sort of
started to slip

164
00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:07,533
and I got cut from NYADA.

165
00:08:07,568 --> 00:08:10,069
What?

166
00:08:10,103 --> 00:08:12,672
Uh... when are you gonna go back
to New York?

167
00:08:12,706 --> 00:08:14,106
I think I'm going to take
a little break.

168
00:08:14,141 --> 00:08:16,242
I wanted to be home, too.

169
00:08:16,276 --> 00:08:17,276
Yeah.

170
00:08:17,277 --> 00:08:18,778
I moved in back with my parents.

171
00:08:18,812 --> 00:08:20,213
And I-I got a job.
At Dalton.

172
00:08:20,247 --> 00:08:22,882
I am the new coach
for the Warblers.

173
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,083
But you don't...

174
00:08:24,117 --> 00:08:25,484
you don't need
a college degree for that?

175
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:27,019
Well, I'm not a real teacher,

176
00:08:27,054 --> 00:08:28,654
but the faculty advisor
got Ebola or something,

177
00:08:28,689 --> 00:08:31,157
so the timing was perfect.

178
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:32,291
You know what?

179
00:08:32,326 --> 00:08:34,486
I think we need to make
a promise to each other.

180
00:08:35,362 --> 00:08:36,562
And I think that,
from here on out,

181
00:08:36,597 --> 00:08:38,831

261
00:12:58,292 --> 00:13:00,493
it's the fact that
I have proven,

262
00:13:00,527 --> 00:13:01,828
once and for all,

263
00:13:01,862 --> 00:13:04,342
young minds do not need

264
00:13:04,365 --> 00:13:06,332

I do pirate reenactments
and I'm also a psychic.

289
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:06,390
I am an accountant by day,

290
00:14:06,424 --> 00:14:08,626
and by night,
I am also an accountant.

291
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,427
To pay the rent, I work
at a Mediterranean-themed

292
00:14:10,462 --> 00:14:11,962
vegan restaurant for pets.

293
00:14:11,997 --> 00:14:13,697
I'm getting something.
I sense that

294
00:14:13,732 --> 00:14:14,865
you just broke up with someone.

295
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,100
That-that's amazing.

296
00:14:16,134 --> 00:14:17,401
Uh, I-I did.

297
00:14:17,435 --> 00:14:20,538
I-I was actually engaged.
Uh, he asked me.

298
00:14:20,572 --> 00:14:22,373
I-I feel like that's important
for people to know,

299
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:24,008
but I'm the one
who called it off.

300
00:14:24,042 --> 00:14:26,477
Yeah, he-he's a great guy,
and if I learned...

301
00:14:26,511 --> 00:14:29,346
Wait, you haven't dated
since you broke up, have you?

302
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:31,715
Wow, you are psychic.

303
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,150
I don't need
to be a psychic to tell

304
00:14:33,151 --> 00:14:34,391
that you're not over this dude.

305
00:14:38,056 --> 00:14:40,057
We're going up against
Mr. Shue at sectionals,

306
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:41,959
so I could really use
whatever notes you have

307
00:14:41,993 --> 00:14:43,193
on how the Warblers are doing.

308
00:14:43,195 --> 00:14:44,361
You really don't want my notes.

309
00:14:44,396 --> 00:14:46,397
I won the gold star
at the loser Olympics.

310
00:14:46,431 --> 00:14:49,433
You can flame out as

So, um, any thoughts?

379
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:13,978
Oh, my gosh, well, I have three.

380
00:17:14,012 --> 00:17:15,713
First of all,
that was incredible.

381
00:17:15,747 --> 00:17:17,581
Second of all,
you're way past the maximum age

382
00:17:17,616 --> 00:17:19,216
to be dancing and singing
with these guys.

383
00:17:20,485 --> 00:17:22,820
And third, thank you.

384
00:17:22,854 --> 00:17:24,188
That was the first time
I've laughed

385
00:17:24,222 --> 00:17:25,523
and smiled
in a really long time.

386
00:17:25,557 --> 00:17:26,657
Of course.

387
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:28,225
Come on, let's go!

388
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,860
My grandma's got one leg,

389
00:17:29,895 --> 00:17:31,862
and she can run
faster than that! Go!

390
00:17:36,301 --> 00:17:38,069
I need water.

391
00:17:38,103 --> 00:17:40,705
Could you stop being
such a whiny Hummel

392
00:17:40,739 --> 00:17:42,039
and get back in there?

393
00:17:43,475 --> 00:17:45,309
Um, excuse me, I haven't
been out of this school

394
00:17:45,344 --> 00:17:46,544
for that long,
but when I was here,

395
00:17:46,578 --> 00:17:48,212
we worked really hard
to make sure bullies like you

396
00:17:48,246 --> 00:17:49,313
don't use words like that.

397
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:50,414
Rachel, no, it's cool.

398
00:17:50,449 --> 00:17:51,529
Spencer is totally gay.

399
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,317
Kind of a
post-modern gay teen.

400
00:17:53,352 --> 00:17:55,252
You see, positive
representations of gays

401
00:17:55,287 --> 00:17:56,687
in the mass media has given me
the confidence

402
00:17:56,722 --> 00:17:58,055
I need to be myself,

403
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:01,525
which, turns out is kind of
an arrogant jerk.

404
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,294
Oh, and your show sucked.

405
00:18:03,328 --> 00:18:05,296
Isn't he a sweetheart?

406
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,450
You're gonna let him
disrespect you like that?

407
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:10,201
Look, like I said, Rachel, okay,
I'm the assistant coach, okay?

408
00:18:10,235 --> 00:18:11,435
I can't yell at them
like Coach Beiste.

409
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,204
Come on! If salmon had legs,

410
00:18:13,238 --> 00:18:15,373
we'd have it for dinner,
not breakfast!

411
00:18:15,407 --> 00:18:17,108
Okay, these guys
are really good.

412
00:18:17,142 --> 00:18:18,209
Yeah, they are.

413
00:18:18,243 --> 00:18:20,544
Yeah, Sue, uh,
spent the off-season

414
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:22,079
recruiting players
from all over the state.

415
00:18:22,114 --> 00:18:23,648
She actually bought a, uh,
apartment complex

416
00:18:23,682 --> 00:18:25,182
and moved all the families into.

417
00:18:25,217 --> 00:18:26,250
I think it's legal.

418
00:18:26,285 --> 00:18:27,585
But what about the arts?

419
00:18:27,619 --> 00:18:29,587
What about music and painting?

420
00:18:29,621 --> 00:18:31,589
It's not right. What about
the kids that don't play sports?

421
00:18:31,623 --> 00:18:32,723
Look, Rachel,

422
00:18:32,758 --> 00:18:33,891
I agree with you, okay?

423
00:18:33,926 --> 00:18:36,027
If you have a problem,
just take it up with Sue.

424
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:41,365
Can I help you?

425
00:18:43,135 --> 00:18:44,769
I'm here to speak
with Sue Sylvester.

426
00:18:44,803 --> 00:18:46,070
It's okay, Janet.

427
00:18:46,104 --> 00:18:47,344
Let her in.

428
00:18:50,576 --> 00:18:52,610
Janet is part
of the free labor arrangement

429
00:18:52,644 --> 00:18:56,214
I have with the
Ohio Department of Corrections.

430
00:18:56,248 --> 00:18:57,982
She's a convicted counterfeiter.

431
00:18:58,016 --> 00:19:00,218
But don't worry,
she's chained to the desk.

432
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:07,024
Congratulations, BTW.

433
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:09,527
The, uh,
humiliating public nature

434
00:19:09,561 --> 00:19:13,297
of your epic flame out
exceeded my expectations

435
00:19:13,332 --> 00:19:14,565
in a major way.

436
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,868
Look, I'm not here
to talk about me.

437
00:19:16,902 --> 00:19:18,569
I'm here to talk
about the glee club.

438
00:19:18,604 --> 00:19:19,804
Well, there is no glee club.

439
00:19:19,838 --> 00:19:21,005
In fact, I exterminated

440
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,740
all the arts programs
at this school.

441
00:19:22,774 --> 00:19:25,543
You can't deprive these kids
an education

442
00:19:25,577 --> 00:19:27,478
in music and theater.

443
00:19:27,513 --> 00:19:30,081
Oh, I can and I did.

444
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:31,616
And it about you, Rachel.

445
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,552
You were the very best
the arts had to offer.

446
00:19:34,586 --> 00:19:37,588
Which means the arts, clearly,

447
00:19:37,623 --> 00:19:39,957
don't have much to offer,
now do they?

448
00:19:41,827 --> 00:19:44,195
There is no glee club
at this school.

449
00:19:44,229 --> 00:19:47,999
There will never be a glee club
at this school

450
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:49,600
as long as I'm in charge.

451
00:19:49,635 --> 00:19:51,302
Now get the hell
out of my office

452
00:19:51,336 --> 00:19:53,304
before I sic
a convicted felon on you.

453
00:19:53,338 --> 00:19:55,606
I've been watching her
out of the corner of my eye

454
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:57,141
for the last few minutes.

455
00:19:57,176 --> 00:20:00,711
I'm pretty sure
she's fashioning a shiv.

456
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,334
You want to order?

457
00:20:08,368 --> 00:20:09,635
Uh, no, I'll wait.

458
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:10,803
Uh, hot date.

459
00:20:24,918 --> 00:20:26,953
Hi. Sorry.

460
00:20:26,987 --> 00:20:29,221
I know I'm a little late,
but it's really coming down,

461
00:20:29,256 --> 00:20:30,756
and I also had to stop by
the Mercer Kitchen

462
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,058
just to check on something.

463
00:20:32,092 --> 00:20:33,426
You're never gonna guess.

464
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:37,363
So, it turns out that
they are totally available

465
00:20:37,397 --> 00:20:39,899
on Labor Day for our wedding.

466
00:20:44,771 --> 00:20:47,173
Why am I always
the first one to arrive?

467
00:20:47,207 --> 00:20:49,167
Um, did you not hear
what I just said?

468
00:20:49,176 --> 00:20:51,143
They're available
for the wedding on Labor Day.

469
00:20:51,178 --> 00:20:53,613
Okay, l-let's-let's just order.

470
00:20:53,647 --> 00:20:55,648
I'm starving.

471
00:20:55,682 --> 00:20:57,562
I don't want to fight
about this,

472
00:20:57,584 --> 00:20:59,986
but I really feel like the whole
wedding planning thing,

473
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,821
it's just all falling on me.

474
00:21:05,325 --> 00:21:07,793
What's the matter?

475
00:21:07,828 --> 00:21:10,329
Tell me. Are...

476
00:21:10,364 --> 00:21:12,064
Are you having second thoughts?

477
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:13,933
Have you noticed

478
00:21:13,967 --> 00:21:16,302
how exhausting it's been

479
00:21:16,336 --> 00:21:17,737
ever since you moved back in?

480
00:21:17,771 --> 00:21:19,138
The other day,

481
00:21:19,172 --> 00:21:22,008
we got into a three-hour fight

482
00:21:22,042 --> 00:21:25,511
because I used a towel
to wipe off my mouth

483
00:21:25,545 --> 00:21:27,980
while there was still toothpaste
on my face.

484
00:21:28,015 --> 00:21:29,148
Well, how is someone else
supposed

485
00:21:29,182 --> 00:21:30,549
to use it
when you leave it like that?

486
00:21:30,584 --> 00:21:33,252
Living together is supposed
to be a trial run,

487
00:21:33,287 --> 00:21:35,454
and I got to tell you,
I think we are failing it.

488
00:21:35,489 --> 00:21:38,224
Thank you for finally
saying something truthful.

489
00:21:38,258 --> 00:21:39,392
Where's that guy been?

490
00:21:39,426 --> 00:21:40,526
Huh? Where have you been?

491
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,061
You've been completely aloof

492
00:21:42,095 --> 00:21:43,896
and totally remote and distant.

493
00:21:43,931 --> 00:21:45,364
It's like I don't even
know you anymore.

494
00:21:45,399 --> 00:21:48,000
I feel like you're just
silently judging me.

495
00:21:48,035 --> 00:21:49,535
What do you even want anymore?

496
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,070
Do you even want this wedding?

497
00:21:51,104 --> 00:21:52,672
Do you even want to marry me?

498
00:21:52,706 --> 00:21:54,774
Maybe I don't!

499
00:22:02,749 --> 00:22:04,750
What changed?

500
00:22:07,421 --> 00:22:10,389
Was it something that I did?

501
00:22:10,424 --> 00:22:12,391
Because...

502
00:22:12,426 --> 00:22:14,894
Because you know...

503
00:22:14,928 --> 00:22:16,896
I love you, I love you so much.

504
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,965
And I-I really think
we can make this work.

505
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:22,301
I love you, too.

506
00:22:22,336 --> 00:22:24,070
But we-we're kids.

507
00:22:27,174 --> 00:22:30,142
Look.

508
00:22:30,177 --> 00:22:31,811
We had a great run,

509
00:22:31,845 --> 00:22:35,314
but let's just call it quits

510
00:22:35,349 --> 00:22:37,783
before we completely
hate each other.

511
00:22:51,732 --> 00:22:53,933
I will never forgive
you for this.

512
00:22:53,967 --> 00:22:55,635
Kurt Hummel?

513
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:56,969
Hey.

514
00:22:57,004 --> 00:22:58,538
I'm Ricardo.

515
00:22:58,572 --> 00:22:59,872
Sorry to keep you waiting.

516
00:22:59,907 --> 00:23:01,541
My spin class ran late.

517
00:23:01,575 --> 00:23:02,808
I...

518
00:23:02,843 --> 00:23:05,478
Are you okay?

519
00:23:08,182 --> 00:23:09,649
I-I-I'm sorry.

520
00:23:09,683 --> 00:23:10,983
I have to go.

521
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:17,023
Bop, bop, bop, bop.

522
00:23:17,057 --> 00:23:18,357
Bop-bop, bop, tsa-tsa-tsa.

523
00:23:19,393 --> 00:23:21,360
Thoughts?

524
00:23:21,395 --> 00:23:23,029
Come on, Danny, pay attention.

525
00:23:23,063 --> 00:23:25,698
You're the only person I trust
to show this stuff to.

526
00:23:25,732 --> 00:23:27,867
You see, Vocal Adrenaline is not
like the New Directions!

527
00:23:27,901 --> 00:23:31,537
They're all about precision
and big dance ensembles.

528
00:23:31,572 --> 00:23:32,872
Perfection.

529
00:23:32,906 --> 00:23:34,507
Can't rely on my old tricks
if I want

530
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:36,475
to get us a win at sectionals,

your show wasn't that bad.

578
00:25:38,165 --> 00:25:40,967
I actually liked, um...
a-a bunch of it.

579
00:25:43,003 --> 00:25:44,437

580
00:25:44,471 --> 00:25:47,140
No, I've just always
seen the best in you.

581
00:25:47,174 --> 00:25:49,776
When I was in high school and
everyone thought I was a loser,

582
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:51,811
I knew that one day I
would have the chance

583
00:25:51,845 --> 00:25:53,312
to show them the truth.

584
00:25:53,347 --> 00:25:55,948
And, well, I got my shot, and
all I did was prove them right.

585
00:25:55,983 --> 00:25:57,617
That was just
one misstep, Rachel.

586
00:25:57,651 --> 00:25:59,485
Yeah, well, that's really
all you get these days.

587
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,620

588

I mean, there's always
something else,

589
00:26:02,322 --> 00:26:04,056
especially for someone
as talented as you are.

590
00:26:04,091 --> 00:26:06,159
I mean, look at me.

592
00:26:07,528 --> 00:26:09,862
Yeah, I lost the New Directions!

593
00:26:09,897 --> 00:26:12,198
But now I'm coaching the most
famous glee club in the world.

594
00:26:12,232 --> 00:26:14,801
Yeah, which I have some pretty
strong feelings about.

595
00:26:14,835 --> 00:26:16,102
I wanted to keep coaching,

596
00:26:16,136 --> 00:26:17,503
and McKinley doesn't have
a glee club anymore.

597
00:26:17,538 --> 00:26:19,458
Well, that never
stopped you before.

598
00:26:21,442 --> 00:26:23,409
I don't have any fight
left in me, Rachel.

599
00:26:23,444 --> 00:26:25,078
I have a baby, and, uh...

600
00:26:25,112 --> 00:26:27,647
And Carmel pays five times
what McKinley did.

601
00:26:27,681 --> 00:26:31,284
This is a good thing.

602

of you guys are there anymore.

No, don't, please.

605
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:40,727
Don't give me some speech

606
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:43,730
about being a part of something
special makes you special,

607
00:26:43,764 --> 00:26:46,399
and that I should just
believe in myself,

608
00:26:46,433 --> 00:26:49,335

609
00:26:49,369 --> 00:26:51,003
How about this?

610
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:53,005
Have you ever seen a guy
shoot a bow and arrow?

611
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,273
When would
I have seen that?

612
00:26:55,642 --> 00:26:57,944
Wait, well, here-here it is.

613
00:26:57,978 --> 00:27:00,546
The power is created by
the bending of the bow, okay?

614
00:27:00,581 --> 00:27:02,548
So-so the more...
the more the bow bends,

615
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:05,885
the more potential energy
is created.

616
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,722
Life's challenges are just
the bending of the bow.

617
00:27:09,757 --> 00:27:10,890
Well, think about it.
Okay.

618
00:27:10,924 --> 00:27:12,892
The bigger the challenge,
the more the bow bends,

619
00:27:12,926 --> 00:27:15,395
the more potential you create
to do something amazing. Right.

620
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:17,997
All you have to do is just...

621
00:27:18,032 --> 00:27:20,099
find a purpose.

622
00:27:20,134 --> 00:27:23,970
- Find the arrow that you're gonna
put in that bow. - : Okay.

623
00:27:24,004 --> 00:27:26,105
- You still got it.
- I still got it!

624
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,107
Oh, my God.

625
00:27:28,142 --> 00:27:30,276
No.
No. The only difference

626
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:33,446
with my situation is that
the bow didn't just bend,

627
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,448
it broke.

628
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,978
- What's going on?
- We're here for an intervention.

00:30:44,959 --> 00:30:48,228
I think the arts are
extremely important.

705
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:51,365
<i>But</i> unfortunately,
the principals are in charge

706
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:53,800
- of the schools.
- Right, but aren't you in charge

707
00:30:53,835 --> 00:30:55,402
of the principals?

708
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,540
Even if I wanted to go
over Sue Sylvester's head,

709
00:30:59,574 --> 00:31:01,041
and reinstate the Glee Club,

710
00:31:01,075 --> 00:31:03,110
it would be impossible
at this point.

711
00:31:03,144 --> 00:31:05,045
The budget's already
been set for the year,

712
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:07,948
and there is... no
money for any new programs.

713
00:31:07,982 --> 00:31:09,983
What if I gave the money?

714
00:31:10,018 --> 00:31:12,138
I-I have some left over
from<i> That's So Rachel.</i>

715
00:31:12,153 --> 00:31:14,521
It's not much,
but I'd be willing to donate it

716
00:31:14,556 --> 00:31:16,423
if it meant bringing back
the Glee Club.

717
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:17,791
Hmm.

718
00:31:21,729 --> 00:31:23,263
You know...

719
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,666
I have to admit, I...

720
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,103
wouldn't mind seeing Sue
Sylvester taken down a peg.

721
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:32,773
I mean, the grades are up, but
I'm not sure about the caning.

722
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:36,243
I have a sneaking suspicion
she's angling for my job.

723
00:31:36,277 --> 00:31:37,911
That would not surprise me.

724
00:31:38,947 --> 00:31:40,247
All right.

725
00:31:40,281 --> 00:31:41,815
You've got a deal.

726
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:44,084
- On one condition.
- Okay.

727
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:46,754
- You run it.
- Excuse me?

728
00:31:46,788 --> 00:31:48,622
I don't know, Rachel,
you seem like

729
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,491
the perfect candidate to me.

730
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:58,565
Hey, Rachel.

731
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,936
Oh.

732
00:32:13,027 --> 00:32:14,961
I showed up.
Six months ago you said

733
00:32:14,995 --> 00:32:17,597
that we would all meet
at that spot outside the loft,

734
00:32:17,631 --> 00:32:18,965
'cause no matter what,
our friendships

735
00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:20,133
were the most important thing.

736
00:32:20,167 --> 00:32:22,502
♪ ♪

737
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,314
Well, I was the only one
who showed up.

738
00:32:34,348 --> 00:32:36,416
And you were clearly
in the midst

739
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,351
of a nervous
breakdown. And...

740
00:32:38,385 --> 00:32:40,520
well, Blaine...

741
00:32:40,554 --> 00:32:42,422
well, I-I blew it.

742
00:32:42,456 --> 00:32:44,891
I blew the best thing
that ever happened to me.

743
00:32:44,925 --> 00:32:46,793
Are you sure
you're not just saying that

744
00:32:46,827 --> 00:32:48,987
because you're lonely?
I mean, New York must feel

745
00:32:48,996 --> 00:32:50,697
pretty empty
without all of us there.

746
00:32:50,731 --> 00:32:52,765
No.

747
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,301
Blaine's the love of my life.

748
00:32:55,336 --> 00:32:56,836
I started seeing this therapist

749
00:32:56,871 --> 00:32:58,638
who said that I have
this thing with love.

750
00:32:58,672 --> 00:33:00,840
You know, men fight as a way

751
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:04,077
to stay connected, but
Blaine wasn't like that.

752
00:33:04,111 --> 00:33:06,679
He wasn't afraid of intimacy.

753
00:33:08,782 --> 00:33:10,884
Ha-has he said anything?

754
00:33:10,918 --> 00:33:14,187
He-he seems to be
in a good place about it.

755
00:33:14,221 --> 00:33:15,588
Well, that's great.

756
00:33:15,623 --> 00:33:17,323
Well, m-maybe I can fix it.

757
00:33:17,358 --> 00:33:20,160
D-Do you think you can arrange
a meeting between he and I

758
00:33:20,194 --> 00:33:22,162
in-in a neutral place
somewhere here in Lima?

759
00:33:22,196 --> 00:33:23,863
Uh, I'm confused.

760
00:33:23,898 --> 00:33:26,432
How do you plan
to fix things long distance?

761
00:33:26,467 --> 00:33:28,868
Well... maybe
it doesn't have

762
00:33:28,903 --> 00:33:30,870
to be long distance.

763
00:33:30,905 --> 00:33:33,385
Look, I... I want to
be here with you guys.

764
00:33:33,407 --> 00:33:35,275
Uh, you've got to help me.

765
00:33:35,309 --> 00:33:38,378
Maybe we can have our
redemption here together.

766
00:33:43,384 --> 00:33:46,019
I think I have the perfect idea.

767
00:33:47,988 --> 00:33:49,856
Thank you so much, gentlemen.

768
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,191
Yeah, we know that in the past

769
00:33:51,225 --> 00:33:53,226
the Glee Club and the AV Club
have had friendly relations.

770
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,762
And we plan to keep that intact.

771
00:33:55,796 --> 00:33:57,796
And we promise
to learn your names, yes.

772
00:33:57,798 --> 00:33:59,132
And that goes for the band, too.

773
00:34:08,676 --> 00:34:10,143
What is this?

774
00:34:10,177 --> 00:34:11,878
We're bringing
back the Glee Club.

775
00:34:11,912 --> 00:34:14,080
I went over your head and
got express written consent

776
00:34:14,115 --> 00:34:15,782
from the superintendent
and there is

777
00:34:15,816 --> 00:34:17,283
nothing you can do to stop us.

778
00:34:17,318 --> 00:34:19,185
Let me get this straight.

779
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,221
The superintendent gave you
permission to demolish

780
00:34:21,255 --> 00:34:23,756
a state-of-the-art computer lab

781
00:34:23,791 --> 00:34:25,758
to make room for a glee club.

782
00:34:25,793 --> 00:34:29,662
He may have been aware
that this was a computer lab.

783
00:34:29,697 --> 00:34:31,898
And who will be running
this glee club?

784
00:34:31,932 --> 00:34:33,800
You, Rachel?

785
00:34:33,834 --> 00:34:35,268
And me.

786
00:34:35,302 --> 00:34:38,438
It's part of my third-year
work study program at NYADA.

787
00:34:38,472 --> 00:34:41,174
Okay, well, I have to, uh, admit
I'm surprised at the speed

788
00:34:41,208 --> 00:34:43,576
with which two
of the Glee Club's

789
00:34:43,611 --> 00:34:46,212
more promising graduates

790
00:34:46,247 --> 00:34:48,681
have tucked their tails
between their legs

791
00:34:48,716 --> 00:34:50,517
and snuck back to high school.

792
00:34:50,551 --> 00:34:53,286
And while I'm always tickled

793
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,855
at the sheer novelty of having
a middlesex like porcelain,

794
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:58,024
'cause it's just so
whimsical to talk

795
00:34:58,058 --> 00:34:59,338
to somebody who looks and sounds

796
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,094
so much like
a gay cartoon walrus,

797
00:35:01,128 --> 00:35:02,128
you,

798
00:35:02,129 --> 00:35:04,063
Rachel Berry,

799
00:35:04,098 --> 00:35:05,498
well, you crossed a line.

800
00:35:05,533 --> 00:35:08,013
I don't appreciate
being told off.

801
00:35:08,035 --> 00:35:10,270
When we met up in New York,

802
00:35:10,304 --> 00:35:12,539
you insulted me
in front of my beau.

803
00:35:12,573 --> 00:35:14,474
Simply because I
flew a thousand miles

804
00:35:14,508 --> 00:35:15,975
to be at your opening night

805
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,577
so I could walk out
in the middle

806
00:35:17,611 --> 00:35:19,571
and have sex all over
your apartment.

807
00:35:20,347 --> 00:35:21,681
And then you do this.

808
00:35:23,984 --> 00:35:25,852
You two have just entered.

809
00:35:25,886 --> 00:35:28,321
Sue Sylvester's Thunderdome.

810
00:35:28,355 --> 00:35:30,290
And I will show you no mercy.

811
00:35:30,324 --> 00:35:32,225
Give no quarter, and my battle

812
00:35:32,259 --> 00:35:33,993
with Will Schuester
will look like

813
00:35:34,028 --> 00:35:36,896
two adorable little baby pandas
play wrestling

814
00:35:36,931 --> 00:35:40,567
in comparison to what I'm going
to unleash on both of you.

815
00:35:42,203 --> 00:35:44,304
You will beg for death.

816
00:35:45,439 --> 00:35:47,574
When will it come?

817
00:35:47,608 --> 00:35:49,142
You think you bottomed out

818
00:35:49,176 --> 00:35:51,978
with that abomination
of a TV show you ran?

819
00:35:52,012 --> 00:35:55,048
No, Rachel Berry,
your national nightmare

820
00:35:55,082 --> 00:35:58,885
has just... begun.

821
00:36:07,294 --> 00:36:09,129
You smell like a nursing home.

822
00:36:34,522 --> 00:36:35,822
<i>Just be cool.</i>

823
00:36:35,856 --> 00:36:38,057
<i>Keep your words
as straight as an arrow.</i>

824
00:36:38,092 --> 00:36:39,626
Hi!

825
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,940
I hope you weren't waiting long.

826
00:36:40,961 --> 00:36:42,662
Uh, no, no. H-Hi!

827
00:36:42,696 --> 00:36:44,164
Hi. Hello.

828
00:36:44,198 --> 00:36:45,932
Hi. Hi.

829
00:36:47,334 --> 00:36:50,103
Um, I-I appreciate
you coming to see me.

830
00:36:50,137 --> 00:36:52,617
I-I would understand if you
had told me to screw off.

831
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,941
No! No, no.
I-I've wanted to see you, uh...

832
00:36:54,975 --> 00:36:57,143
Well, I-I'm here
to get you back.

833
00:36:57,178 --> 00:36:58,845
I-I don't mean
to blurt it out like that,

834
00:36:58,879 --> 00:37:00,980
but for-for the sake of clarity,

835
00:37:01,015 --> 00:37:02,215
you should know that first

836
00:37:02,249 --> 00:37:04,918
I'm going to get your
forgiveness and-and then

837
00:37:04,952 --> 00:37:06,953
I'm gonna get your heart back.

838
00:37:08,289 --> 00:37:10,623
Um...

839
00:37:10,658 --> 00:37:12,625
I'm seeing someone.

840
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,095
<i>Don't cry. Be cool.</i>

841
00:37:15,129 --> 00:37:17,564
<i>Smile, Oh, God.
I'm gonna be sick.</i>

842
00:37:17,598 --> 00:37:21,501
And I, I wanted
to tell you in person

843
00:37:21,535 --> 00:37:23,803
especially because you know him.

little weird for you.

What? No, it's-it's
not weird at all.

850
00:37:41,279 --> 00:37:44,047
No, uh-uh, so, how'd
you two meet up again?

851
00:37:44,082 --> 00:37:46,650
Well, um, it was actually just
a few months ago right here

852
00:37:46,684 --> 00:37:47,984
as a matter of fact.

Yeah.

860
00:38:05,203 --> 00:38:07,537
We got to talking mo-mostly,
mostly about you.

861
00:38:07,572 --> 00:38:10,440
I was just so angry
with what had happened.

862
00:38:10,475 --> 00:38:12,943
And it was just me venting
about the breakup.

863
00:38:12,977 --> 00:38:15,312
But I reminded him,

864
00:38:15,346 --> 00:38:16,713
you know, how much you helped me

865
00:38:16,748 --> 00:38:18,148

00:38:44,542 --> 00:38:47,711
And I know this isn't gonna
be easy, but I just wanted

881
00:38:47,745 --> 00:38:49,880
all of us to be able
to be adults about this.

882
00:38:49,914 --> 00:38:52,349
And I'm hoping
we can be friends.

883
00:38:52,383 --> 00:38:54,618
You know, we can
all hang out and stuff.

884
00:38:54,652 --> 00:38:56,420
Sounds like fun.

885
00:38:56,454 --> 00:38:58,455
Um, if-if-if can you excuse me.

886
00:38:58,489 --> 00:39:00,157
I have to use the restroom.

887
00:39:31,756 --> 00:39:34,358
Perfect.

888
00:39:34,392 --> 00:39:35,759
Definitely want this.

889
00:39:35,793 --> 00:39:37,294
Put it right there.

890
00:39:41,232 --> 00:39:43,233
I always thought one day Finn
would take this place over.

891
00:39:43,268 --> 00:39:45,502
Yeah, well, it's just
for a couple months

892
00:39:45,536 --> 00:39:46,904
till I get my feet
on the ground.

893
00:39:46,938 --> 00:39:48,905
You know what that means yet?

894
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,842
Broadway.
It was always my dream.

895
00:39:51,876 --> 00:39:54,978
Still is. I had it once
and I lost it,

896
00:39:55,013 --> 00:39:56,980
but I'm gonna get it back.

897
00:39:57,015 --> 00:39:59,349
So... don't bet against me.

898
00:39:59,384 --> 00:40:01,418
I never have and I never will.

899
00:40:01,452 --> 00:40:05,122
I, um...
I wanted to bring you something.

900
00:40:11,329 --> 00:40:13,664
I think it belongs right here.

901
00:40:15,233 --> 00:40:18,201
And just
a little friendly reminder,

902
00:40:18,236 --> 00:40:20,437
you're gonna be facing
off against Blaine

903
00:40:20,471 --> 00:40:22,372
and me at sectionals, so, um,

904
00:40:22,407 --> 00:40:24,208
I think it's time
you start recruiting.

905
00:40:24,242 --> 00:40:26,577
Yeah.

906
00:40:26,611 --> 00:40:29,613
