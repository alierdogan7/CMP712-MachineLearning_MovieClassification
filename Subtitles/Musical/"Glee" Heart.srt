00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,844
(School bell ringing)

2
00:00:02,845 --> 00:00:04,346
Good.
(cymbal crashes)

3
00:00:04,347 --> 00:00:05,722
(Rachel laughs)

4
00:00:05,723 --> 00:00:09,309
Okay, everybody,
let's hear it for love!

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,894
Your assignment
for Valentine's week

6
00:00:10,895 --> 00:00:15,482
is to find and perform
the world's greatest love songs.

7
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:16,775
Now, Regionals
is next week,

8
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:18,286
and we still need to raise

9
00:00:18,287 --> 00:00:20,987
$250 for costumes
and hair spray.

10
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:22,531
Oh, God, not another bake sale.

11
00:00:22,532 --> 00:00:23,490
WILL:
If any student gives

12
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:25,242
ten dollars, we will sing these

13
00:00:25,243 --> 00:00:26,910
"world's greatest love songs"
to their Valentine.

14
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:28,620
We will serenade
each classroom...

15
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:30,414
- STUDENTS: No!
- Yes!

16
00:00:30,415 --> 00:00:32,999
Two years ago, we went
room-to-room Christmas caroling,

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,959
they threw food.

18
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,336
And shoes.
Yes, Sugar?

19
00:00:35,337 --> 00:00:37,872
Here's a spoonful of Sugar
for you all:

20
00:00:37,873 --> 00:00:40,007
Don't sweat the small stuff,

21
00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:42,551
and it's all small stuff
when you're rich.

22
00:00:42,552 --> 00:00:44,052
So, here you go.

23
00:00:44,053 --> 00:00:46,304
Uh, Sugar,
I can't take that.

24
00:00:46,305 --> 00:00:47,889
Take it!

25
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,567
Okay.

26
00:00:49,568 --> 00:00:51,393
Everyone, give it up
for Sugar for paying for

27
00:00:51,394 --> 00:00:52,436
our FinalNet
and cumberbunds!

28
00:00:52,437 --> 00:00:53,768
SUGAR: I love
the sound of applause,

29
00:00:53,769 --> 00:00:55,814
even if I have to buy it.

30
00:00:55,815 --> 00:00:59,192
Okay, everyone, look
under your chairs.

31
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:00,527
Except you, Artie.

32
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:01,903
Your chair kept moving, so I hid

33
00:01:01,904 --> 00:01:03,344
your surprise
in the wastebasket.

34
00:01:06,682 --> 00:01:08,869
I found mine ten minutes ago.

35
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,037
V-Day is my
fave day ever.

36
00:01:10,038 --> 00:01:11,580
And to help me
celebrate, my daddy's

37
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:14,499
throwing me a huge, ridic party
at Breadstix.

38
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,917
And I'm naming it

39
00:01:15,918 --> 00:01:17,141
the Sugar Shack.

40
00:01:17,142 --> 00:01:19,527
And... drumroll, Rachel...

41
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,174
... you're all invited!

42
00:01:22,175 --> 00:01:24,050
(Students cheer)

43
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:26,094
But you have to bring a date.

44
00:01:26,095 --> 00:01:27,971
No single people allowed.

45
00:01:27,972 --> 00:01:32,476
They're sad and boring and
they don't exist in my world.

46
00:01:32,477 --> 00:01:34,325
Um, but you're single.

47
00:01:34,326 --> 00:01:35,860
Not for long.

48
00:01:37,688 --> 00:01:39,191
(Giggles)

49
00:01:45,112 --> 00:01:47,305
Wait, what are
you doing here?

50
00:01:47,306 --> 00:01:49,707
I got a note that says "Come to
the auditorium now. It's urgent."

51
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,709
Love, Mandy Patinkin."
Yeah, so did I.

52
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,997
MEN:
♪ Going to the chapel

53
00:01:53,998 --> 00:01:55,749

54
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,083

Is that your dads?

56
00:01:58,044 --> 00:02:00,601
♪ Going to the chapel

57
00:02:00,602 --> 00:02:03,673

59
00:02:05,908 --> 00:02:07,469
Thanks, guys.
Thank you, thank you.

60
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,595
LeRoy, we agreed
to sing it straight...

61
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:10,278
no vocal runs.

62
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:12,330
That's how Jennifer Hudson
got kicked off of <i>American Idol.</i>

63
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:14,332
I would love to hear you
sing something straight.

64
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,311
Dads, what are
you doing here?

65
00:02:16,312 --> 00:02:19,064
Well, a little birdie named
Burt, who owns a tire store,

66
00:02:19,065 --> 00:02:20,482
and his little birdie wife,

67
00:02:20,483 --> 00:02:22,734
who used to wear a lot of denim,
told us

68
00:02:22,735 --> 00:02:26,410
that you guys were, uh,
fixin' to get hitched.

69
00:02:26,411 --> 00:02:28,073
So we thought we'd
return the favor

70
00:02:28,074 --> 00:02:30,200
and surprise you.

71
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:31,284
Mr. and Mr. Berry,

72
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:33,050
I am so sorry.

73
00:02:33,051 --> 00:02:34,412
It's only customary to ask

74
00:02:34,413 --> 00:02:35,455
the bride's father
first, but...

75
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,588
We wanted to say...

76
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:38,875
congratulations!

77
00:02:38,876 --> 00:02:41,692
And what better place
than on the very stage

78
00:02:41,693 --> 00:02:43,630
on which you shared
your first kiss?

79
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:44,798
So you're not angry?

80
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:46,230
Not at you.

81
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:47,732
I'm angry 'cause
evidently your father

82
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:49,427
has been having
recurring dreams

83
00:02:49,428 --> 00:02:51,638
about Hollywood heartthrob
Tony Danza.

84
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,348
One dream.
I had one dream

85
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:56,518
that Tony Danza and I
went ice fishing, okay?

86
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:59,396
We know you two
really love each other.

87
00:02:59,397 --> 00:03:01,147
And if you're
really sure

88
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:03,233
you want to spend
the rest of

89
00:03:03,234 --> 00:03:05,193
your lives together,
the last thing

90
00:03:05,194 --> 00:03:06,528
we want to do
is stand in your way.

91
00:03:06,529 --> 00:03:07,988
No, we wouldn't do that.

92
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:10,972
I mean, marrying
in your teens usually,

93
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:14,077
you know, doubles the likelihood
of divorce...

94
00:03:14,078 --> 00:03:15,954
a fate that befell
Liza and Barbra...

95
00:03:15,955 --> 00:03:17,728
Are you really going to do this
right now?

96
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:20,348
Oh, why, you know who else
got, uh, just got divorced?

97
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:22,794
Tony Danza!
Yeah, did you hear that, LeRoy?

98
00:03:22,795 --> 00:03:25,171
Oh! Yeah, he's single now.

99
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:27,299
Why don't you fire
up those snowmobiles

100
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,689
and give him a call?

101
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,274
It's ice fishing season.

102
00:03:30,275 --> 00:03:31,887
What your dad
is trying to say

103
00:03:31,888 --> 00:03:33,763
is that he's very excited

104
00:03:33,764 --> 00:03:37,114
to start planning
his only daughter's wedding.

105
00:03:37,115 --> 00:03:38,666
I'm so excited, yeah.

106
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:40,437
But, uh, we are using
the square tables.

107
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:41,819
Well, we want to start

108
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,609
with a Valentine's Day dinner
at our house

109
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,041
with the Hudson-Hummels.

110
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:48,626
We're going to be
one big family, so...

111
00:03:48,627 --> 00:03:49,863
let's make a milestone
out of it.

112
00:03:49,864 --> 00:03:51,662
You were raised to be proud

113
00:03:51,663 --> 00:03:53,097
of the decisions that you make.

114
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:55,744
And if this is what
you really want, sweetie,

115
00:03:55,745 --> 00:04:01,472
well, then you need to start
shouting it from the rooftops!

116
00:04:01,473 --> 00:04:02,640
(Vocalizing)

117
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:03,627
♪ Yeah!

118
00:04:03,628 --> 00:04:05,009
I love you both so much.

119
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,694
Ah, yeah.
(chuckles)

120
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,097
(school bell ringing)

121
00:04:16,098 --> 00:04:18,600
I now call this meeting
of the God Squad to order.

122
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:19,874
Thank you guys
for coming.

123
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,158
Our first order
of business is

124
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:22,979
to welcome Quinn Fabray back
into the fold.

125
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,628
It's nice to
see you, Quinn.

126
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:25,899
Thank you.
I know it's been a while.

127
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,025
When I was at my lowest,

128
00:04:27,026 --> 00:04:28,985
I turned to prayer.

129
00:04:28,986 --> 00:04:31,947
Not even sure who I was
praying to, really,

130
00:04:31,948 --> 00:04:33,788
but it seemed to lead me
on the right track.

131
00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:35,089
Amen.
Praise.

132
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:37,224
Can I ask a question?

133
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:38,036
What's with tarantula head
over here?

134
00:04:38,037 --> 00:04:39,537
This is our new member.

135
00:04:39,538 --> 00:04:41,957
This is Joseph Hart,
but you guys can call him Joe.

136
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,583
He just transferred
here to McKinley.

137
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:45,816
Yeah, I guess I'm a sophomore.
I've been homeschooled

138
00:04:45,817 --> 00:04:47,351
my whole life,
but this past year I realized

139
00:04:47,352 --> 00:04:48,296
my best friend
was my mom,

140
00:04:48,297 --> 00:04:50,237
so I decided I wanted to get out

141
00:04:50,238 --> 00:04:51,800
and experience the world.

142
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,135
MERCEDES (whispers):
<i>Joseph.</i>

143
00:04:54,136 --> 00:04:55,893
What's with the tats?
Bible quotes.

144
00:04:55,894 --> 00:04:58,098
And each one of my dreads is
named after a book of the Bible.

145
00:04:58,099 --> 00:04:59,641
You have got to be kidding me.

146
00:04:59,642 --> 00:05:01,999
I play guitar, too,
but I only know Christian stuff.

147
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,604
My dad only listens to talk
radio, and we don't have a TV.

148
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:06,837
You guys mind
if I take off my shoes?

149
00:05:06,838 --> 00:05:08,650
I'm sort of used to
going to school barefoot.

150
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:10,986
I'm just glad there's another
dude around here.

151
00:05:10,987 --> 00:05:12,028
I notice that Shane

152
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:13,761
isn't a member of the God Squad.

153
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:17,409
- That's interesting.
- Okay, that's enough, Sam.

154
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,516
All right, so
our last meeting

155
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:19,834
we talked about opportunities

156
00:05:19,835 --> 00:05:21,079
for community service.

157
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,206
Uh, Valentine's Day's
right around the corner,

158
00:05:23,207 --> 00:05:25,139
and since the Glee Club
turned it down,

159
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,294
there's an open slot
for singing telegrams.

160
00:05:27,295 --> 00:05:28,461
All four of us sing,

161
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:30,027
and Teen Jesus
and I play guitar,

162
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:31,673
so I thought we could
use the money to

163
00:05:31,674 --> 00:05:33,216
adopt a highway
and start a shoe drive.

164
00:05:33,217 --> 00:05:34,342
Praise.

165
00:05:34,343 --> 00:05:36,283
It is a religious holiday...
St. Valentine's and all that.

166
00:05:36,284 --> 00:05:38,736
And I'd love to show this school
that it's cool to be Christian.

167
00:05:38,737 --> 00:05:39,639
We aren't all
just door-to-door

168
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,349
Bible salesmen, like my dad.

169
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,790
All right, all in favor?

170
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:47,294
(School bell ringing)
Righteous.

171
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:53,784
Wait, which one are you gonna
take to Sugar's V-Day party?

172
00:05:53,785 --> 00:05:55,447
All of them.

173
00:05:55,448 --> 00:05:56,865
The entire sorority?

174
00:05:56,866 --> 00:05:58,589
They don't call them
the "E-Z-Dee-Zees" for nothing.

175
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,758
I got the gig cleaning the
sorority house swimming pool,

176
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,292
then I sawed through
those chicks

177
00:06:02,293 --> 00:06:03,677
like a freakin'

00:06:03,678 --> 00:06:05,415
room to room.
You're amazing.

179
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,398
I'm a professional.

180
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,799
Tried the true love thing...

181
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,462
With a teacher.
(chuckles)

182
00:06:10,463 --> 00:06:12,770
- Wasn't for me.
- Well, it is for me.

183
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:14,522
And apparently it's
for Blaine, too.

184
00:06:14,523 --> 00:06:17,274
Look: even from his sick
bed, he's managed to send me

185
00:06:17,275 --> 00:06:19,743
a new Valentine's Day card
every single day this week.

186
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,614
It says
"From your secret admirer."

187
00:06:23,615 --> 00:06:25,018
(sighs)
So romantic.

188
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:26,394
Oh.

189
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:27,937
Ooh.

190
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:29,670
A gorilla gram?

191
00:06:29,671 --> 00:06:30,690
<i>Pour moi?</i>

192
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:31,789
(chuckles)

193
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,790
"To Kurt.

194
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:33,818
From your secret admirer."

195
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:35,492
Again.

196
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:37,113
Well, I wonder
who it could be.

197
00:06:37,114 --> 00:06:38,740
Will you tell me who it is,
Valentine gorilla?

198
00:06:42,952 --> 00:06:45,413
You see, Puckerman, that's
what you're missing out on:

199
00:06:45,414 --> 00:06:46,664
True love.

200
00:06:47,498 --> 00:06:48,639
What about you, Rory?

201
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,690
Who are you taking
to Sugar's party?

202
00:06:49,691 --> 00:06:50,627
Sugar.

203
00:06:50,628 --> 00:06:52,059
Hold up.

204
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,671
You better have an option "B"
because I'm all over that.

205
00:06:53,672 --> 00:06:54,964
You're going with Sugar?

206
00:06:54,965 --> 00:06:56,257
As soon as I ask her out,

207
00:06:56,258 --> 00:06:57,842
and she says yes,
which I'm sure she will

208
00:06:57,843 --> 00:07:00,637
because... I don't mean this
to sound mean, Irish...

209
00:07:00,638 --> 00:07:01,952
but nobody understands
anything you say.

210
00:07:01,953 --> 00:07:03,515
Baloney.
Chicks dig accents.

211
00:07:03,516 --> 00:07:05,406
I'm sorry, what was that?
Couldn't quite make it out.

212
00:07:05,407 --> 00:07:06,490
PUCK: Fellas, there's
no need to fight.

213
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:07,875
You can just pick up the girls

214
00:07:07,876 --> 00:07:08,978
that fall off
old Puckerosaurus here.

215
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:12,107
This is a four-leaf clover, kid.

216
00:07:12,108 --> 00:07:13,380
'Cause you're going to need

217
00:07:13,381 --> 00:07:14,651
all the luck you can get.

218
00:07:14,652 --> 00:07:16,550
Do you people
just carry those around?

Happy Valentine's Day.

243
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,780
You're giving me your
computer for Valentine's Day?

244
00:09:23,781 --> 00:09:25,148
It's a playlist.

245
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:27,317
With all the songs
that I hear in my head

246
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:29,285
when I'm with you
or when I'm thinking about you.

247
00:09:29,286 --> 00:09:30,995
I wanted to make you a CD
for Valentine's Day,

248
00:09:30,996 --> 00:09:34,874
but this is as far
as I got without any help, so...

249
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,344
Oh, and I made you a cover.

250
00:09:39,086 --> 00:09:40,088
Brittany.

251
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,132
Thank you.

252
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:44,634
You're welcome.

253
00:09:44,635 --> 00:09:45,760
(Giggles)

254
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:52,642
Teen lesbians!

255
00:09:52,643 --> 00:09:54,435
I must see you

256
00:09:54,436 --> 00:09:57,188
in my office, right now.

257
00:09:57,189 --> 00:09:58,565
This is such bull crap!

258
00:09:58,566 --> 00:10:00,400
Why can't Brittany and I
kiss in public?

259
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:01,442
'Cause we're two girls?

260
00:10:01,443 --> 00:10:02,869
Please don't make this about

261
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,153
your sapphic orientation.

262
00:10:04,154 --> 00:10:06,406
This is about
public displays of affection.

263
00:10:06,407 --> 00:10:08,283
PDA simply has no place

264
00:10:08,284 --> 00:10:10,493
in the sacred halls
of McKinley High.

265
00:10:10,494 --> 00:10:12,120
We've had complaints.

266
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:13,580
About us? When?

267
00:10:13,581 --> 00:10:15,290
Most recently...

268
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:18,001
yesterday, 12:16 p.m.

269
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:20,837
That?

270
00:10:20,838 --> 00:10:23,047
Our lips barely
even grazed.

271
00:10:23,048 --> 00:10:25,208
And by the way, did you get
any complaints about

272
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:27,477
that hideous display
that started at 12:17 p.m.

273
00:10:27,478 --> 00:10:30,096
and lasted for several
uncomfortable minutes?

274
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,769
Believe me, I'd much rather
see you and Santana kiss

275
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,070
than that so-called Finchel,

276
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:39,230
but if a student
files a complaint

277
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,724
- because, for religious reasons...
- Oh. Great.

278
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,360
So it was some Bible-thumper
that complained.

279
00:10:43,361 --> 00:10:45,445
Ms. Lopez, I'm sorry,
but I'm trying

280
00:10:45,446 --> 00:10:48,448
to keep this school from turning
into a volatile powder keg.

281
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:50,200
I'm sorry, too.

282
00:10:50,201 --> 00:10:52,536
'Cause all I want to be able
to do is kiss my girlfriend,

283
00:10:52,537 --> 00:10:54,538
but I guess no one can see that
because there's such

284
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:57,123
an insane double standard
at this school.

285
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:01,085

Artie, four wheels
on the floor, please.

288
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:10,554
Rachel, you had an announcement?

289
00:11:10,555 --> 00:11:11,888
Yeah, actually, Finn and
I have an announcement

290
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:13,523
we'd like to make.

291
00:11:13,524 --> 00:11:17,027
Finn and I are
proud to announce...

292
00:11:17,028 --> 00:11:18,111
that we're finally
getting married.

293
00:11:18,112 --> 00:11:20,880
What?
Wow!

294
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,816
When's the baby's due date?

295
00:11:22,817 --> 00:11:24,150
Wait, guys, have you both
carefully thought this through?

296
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,269
Yes. And our parents
are totally behind us.

297
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,454
And your plan to stop us
by telling them

298
00:11:27,455 --> 00:11:29,573
totally backfired, Mr. Shue.

299
00:11:29,574 --> 00:11:31,774
Actually, I'm the one
who told them.

300
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,376
Because I think you guys
are making a mistake.

301
00:11:33,377 --> 00:11:35,412
A huge mistake.

302
00:11:35,413 --> 00:11:37,297
- When's the wedding?
- The date is TBD,

303
00:11:37,298 --> 00:11:38,781
but I can assure
all of you that

304
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:39,949
we're gonna have a very simple
and elegant ceremony

305
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,051
at the Justice of the Peace,

306
00:11:41,052 --> 00:11:42,627
which all of you
are invited to.

307
00:11:42,628 --> 00:11:44,220
And we're registered
at Samuel French.

308
00:11:44,221 --> 00:11:45,622
You guys aren't mature enough

309
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:47,256
or old enough to properly

310
00:11:47,257 --> 00:11:48,966
face this type
of commitment.

311
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:51,427
If you don't support us,
then I feel sorry for you,

312
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:52,929
and you're not invited
to the wedding.

313
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,931
Which makes me really sad,
because I would have loved

314
00:11:54,932 --> 00:11:56,182
to have seen you in
a bridesmaid's dress, Quinn.

315
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:57,392
And you as well, Kurt.

316
00:11:58,141 --> 00:11:59,936
I'd be happy
to be a bridesmaid, Rachel.

317
00:11:59,937 --> 00:12:01,187
I'm not sure I'm ready
to get married,

318
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:03,073
but I do know what being
in love feels like.

319
00:12:03,074 --> 00:12:05,575
- We'll be there.
- Thanks, guys.

320
00:12:05,576 --> 00:12:07,977
And we hope the rest of
you all change your minds,

321
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:10,405
because it would mean a lot
to us if you were all there.

322
00:12:10,406 --> 00:12:12,449
Well, add me to the list
of people who are wishing

323
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,317
you guys the best
in your marriage.

324
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:16,494
However, let's stop
the fighting

325
00:12:16,495 --> 00:12:18,088
and remind ourselves that

326
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:19,747
Valentine's Day
is rapidly approaching.

327
00:12:19,748 --> 00:12:21,874
So if you'll
excuse me.

328
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,710
- (Quietly): If you'll excuse me.
- Yeah. Sorry.

329
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:25,962
ARTIE:
Congrats, though.

330
00:12:25,963 --> 00:12:28,506

game to spit.

331

All right, guys.

508

and figure out
what the God Squad feels

509

about singing to gay people.

510
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:45,525
Well, three of us
are in Glee Club,

511
00:20:45,526 --> 00:20:47,895
so we're pretty much sing
to gay people all the time.

but Joe may not be.

I try my best not
to judge anybody.

514
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:54,568
But, honestly, I've never met
anyone who's gay.

515
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:56,221
Oh, I guarantee you have.

516
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:58,488
Yeah, they say that one out of
every ten people are gay.

517
00:20:58,489 --> 00:21:00,226
And if that's true, that means
one of the 12 apostles

518
00:21:00,227 --> 00:21:01,742
might have been gay.

519
00:21:01,743 --> 00:21:04,912
And my guess is Simon because
that name's the gayest.

520
00:21:04,913 --> 00:21:06,413
The Bible says it's

521
00:21:06,414 --> 00:21:08,048
an abomination for a man
to lay down with another man,

522
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:09,950
but we shared tents
in Cub Scouts

523
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,286
and slept next
to each other all the time...

524
00:21:13,287 --> 00:21:14,922
so that would make
Cub Scouts an abomination?

525
00:21:14,923 --> 00:21:17,174
Do you know what else the Bible
says is an abomination?

526
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:18,558
Eating lobster,

527
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,126
planting different crops
in the same field,

528
00:21:20,127 --> 00:21:21,728
giving somebody a proud look.

529
00:21:21,729 --> 00:21:23,847
Not an abomination? Slavery.

530
00:21:23,848 --> 00:21:25,599
Jesus never said
anything about gay people.

531
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,650
That's a fact.

532
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:28,101
Well, maybe he wanted to,

533
00:21:28,102 --> 00:21:29,653
but he didn't want
to hurt Simon's feelings.

534
00:21:29,654 --> 00:21:31,805
You guys, we have to figure out
where we stand.

535
00:21:31,806 --> 00:21:33,941
Especially, if we're gonna be
asking volunteers

536
00:21:33,942 --> 00:21:36,309
from my church
to sing backup for us.

537
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,812
I don't want
to hurt Santana's feelings,

538
00:21:38,813 --> 00:21:40,163
but I also don't
want to make someone

539
00:21:40,164 --> 00:21:42,582
do something they're not
comfortable with.

540
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:43,584
So where do you stand, Joe?

541
00:21:44,852 --> 00:21:47,481
I guess I've gotta
think about it.

542
00:21:47,482 --> 00:21:49,256
You know what?
That's totally fair.

543
00:21:49,257 --> 00:21:51,658
You have to look at
the hard topics and dilemmas

544
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:53,821
and be honest and truthful.

545
00:21:53,822 --> 00:21:55,698
If you ask me...

546
00:21:55,699 --> 00:21:57,681
that's what being
Christian is really about.

547
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,101
(School bell rings)

548
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,039
I know it's early, but...

549
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:07,858
It's a statue
of St. Valentine.

550
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,009
Well, actually,
it's a statue

551
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,394
of one
of the three wise men

552
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,178
I repainted to look
like Saint...

553
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:13,382
I told Shane about us.

554
00:22:13,383 --> 00:22:15,884
Wow.

555
00:22:15,885 --> 00:22:18,220
Was he mad?
He was sad.

556
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:21,473
He cried and said it felt like
I punched him in his heart.

557
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:23,726
I saw this MMA guy get
punched in the heart once.

558
00:22:23,727 --> 00:22:25,769
He died for, like, a minute.

559
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,313
That sucks.

560
00:22:27,314 --> 00:22:30,330
At least it means we can be
together for real now.

561
00:22:30,331 --> 00:22:32,049
Whoa.

562
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:37,156
What we did... what I
did to Shane was wrong.

563
00:22:37,157 --> 00:22:40,307
I lied, I cheated,

564
00:22:40,308 --> 00:22:41,952
and it makes me feel awful,

565
00:22:41,953 --> 00:22:46,513
and I love you, but being with
you just reminds me of that...

566
00:22:46,514 --> 00:22:48,083
that I'm not the person
that I thought I was.

567
00:22:48,084 --> 00:22:49,877
We would never do that
to each other.

568
00:22:49,878 --> 00:22:51,985
I thought that I'd
never do that to Shane.

569
00:22:53,855 --> 00:22:55,215
But I have to face
the truth.

570
00:22:55,216 --> 00:22:59,026
When it comes to love,
I don't know who I am,

571
00:22:59,027 --> 00:23:03,057
and until I find out,
I can't be with anyone.

572
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:06,283
I-I can't be with you.

Yeah, thank you.

661
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:20,415
See, I have a couple of notes.

662
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:22,042
I said, "LeRoy,
this guy sold us"

663
00:28:22,043 --> 00:28:23,828
the wrong lube."
Yeah.

664
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:25,879
"That's why
the rubber is squeaking.

665
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,839
"That's why it feels
so weird

666
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,800
when we start going
really fast."

667
00:28:29,801 --> 00:28:31,718
Excuse me, Hiram, what
are we talking about?

668
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:32,677
We're talking cars.

669
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:33,871
Yeah, those clowns

670
00:28:33,872 --> 00:28:34,846
down at Local Lube...
they don't know

671
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:35,887

676
00:28:41,562 --> 00:28:43,397
That's not true.

677
00:28:43,398 --> 00:28:45,266
Yeah, no, it's not, no, no,
no, not true, but it feels

00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:46,608

Nate, Nate Berkus.

681
00:28:50,321 --> 00:28:52,823
So, Mr. Berrys,
how did you two meet?

682
00:28:52,824 --> 00:28:54,224
Ooh.
Ah.

683
00:28:54,225 --> 00:28:55,367
Hey, that's a,

684
00:28:55,368 --> 00:28:56,952
th-th-that's a funny story.

685
00:28:56,953 --> 00:28:59,830
We were both in the international
supergroup Up with People.

686
00:28:59,831 --> 00:29:01,832
Up with People was a sensation.

687
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:04,584
Glenn Close, you know, she got
her start on Up with People.

688
00:29:04,585 --> 00:29:07,254
Yeah, and we've been together
ever since, which was, uh,

689
00:29:07,255 --> 00:29:09,673
in our late 20s, early 30s
when we got together.

690
00:29:09,674 --> 00:29:10,799
Uh, and on that note,

691
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,384
may I make a toast

692
00:29:12,385 --> 00:29:17,298
to Rachel and Finn on this
very special Valentine's Day?

693
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:20,100
Finn, you're a

694
00:29:20,101 --> 00:29:23,311
fantastic... husky

695
00:29:23,312 --> 00:29:27,808
young man whom LeRoy
and I simply adore,

696
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:28,775
and it gives us

697
00:29:28,776 --> 00:29:30,694
such joy to see you make

698
00:29:30,695 --> 00:29:32,612
our little
Rachelah so happy.

699
00:29:32,613 --> 00:29:35,407
Let me tell you the secret of
a long and happy marriage...

700
00:29:35,408 --> 00:29:39,828
never go to bed
without moisturizing.

701
00:29:39,829 --> 00:29:40,871
Bet you thought
I was going

702
00:29:40,872 --> 00:29:42,272
to say "Never go
to bed angry."

703
00:29:42,273 --> 00:29:44,332
Okay, let's get
back on track here.

704
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:47,294

705
00:29:47,295 --> 00:29:49,780
Hudson-Hummel-Berry clan.

00:29:50,796 --> 00:29:53,751
And to Finn and Rachel.

707
00:29:53,752 --> 00:29:56,178
We love you both
so very, very much.

708
00:29:56,179 --> 00:29:57,596
We sure do.

709
00:29:57,597 --> 00:30:00,307
To Finn and Rachel.
Finn and Rachel. Indeed.

710
00:30:00,308 --> 00:30:01,391
HIRAM:
Mmm.

711
00:30:01,392 --> 00:30:02,893
Mm-mm-mm!

712
00:30:02,894 --> 00:30:04,011
Now dessert.

713
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:05,228
Oh, you know what we've got?

714
00:30:05,229 --> 00:30:07,189
Velvety Viennetta,

715
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:11,352
and then we're going to commence
with the teenage lovemaking.

716
00:30:13,471 --> 00:30:14,404
No, just kidding.

717
00:30:14,405 --> 00:30:15,655
(laughing):
No.

718
00:30:15,656 --> 00:30:18,074
We, we don't have Viennetta.

719
00:30:18,075 --> 00:30:19,577
They discontinued
Viennetta years ago.

720
00:30:19,578 --> 00:30:21,453
We're gonna go straight
to the teenage lovemaking.

721
00:30:21,454 --> 00:30:23,205
I'm sorry, what?
Yeah.

722
00:30:23,206 --> 00:30:24,456
Wait, w-what are
you talking about?

723
00:30:24,457 --> 00:30:25,833
Your mom packed a bag.

724
00:30:25,834 --> 00:30:28,335
I brought your toothbrush
and your jammies...

725
00:30:28,336 --> 00:30:29,836
- your sleepy T-shirt and, and boxers.
- Mom. No, I did, yeah.

726
00:30:29,837 --> 00:30:32,214
You're getting married,
you're not kids anymore.

727
00:30:32,215 --> 00:30:34,382
As far as we're concerned,
you're adults,

728
00:30:34,383 --> 00:30:36,760
so knock yourself out. Carole
and I are gonna go catch a movie.

729
00:30:36,761 --> 00:30:38,887
Hiram and I are going
to stay here,

730
00:30:38,888 --> 00:30:40,639
but we'll put on some music

731
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,134
just so you don't think
we're trying to listen in.

732
00:30:46,354 --> 00:30:48,439
I can't believe
this is happening.

733
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,724
I love you.

734
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:52,643
Let's go to bed.

735
00:30:52,644 --> 00:30:54,478
Okay.

736
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:02,869
I know it's tempting,

737
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,329
but, uh,
no monkey business tonight,

738
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:06,581
not with my dads
around the corner.

739
00:31:06,582 --> 00:31:08,209
Of course.

740
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,043
Are you, you gonna use
the bathroom first?

741
00:31:10,044 --> 00:31:12,546
Yes, if that's okay because
my ritual is pretty elaborate.

742
00:31:12,547 --> 00:31:14,422
Okay.

743
00:31:14,423 --> 00:31:15,924
RACHEL:
<i>First I shower.</i>

744
00:31:15,925 --> 00:31:17,751
<i>I'm more thorough
than during my morning bath.</i>

745
00:31:17,752 --> 00:31:19,970
<i>The world is
a very dirty place.</i>

746
00:31:19,971 --> 00:31:23,181
<i>Brush teeth, eyebrows,
makeup remover, moisturizer,</i>

747
00:31:23,182 --> 00:31:24,975
<i>followed by an ice water
face bath</i>

748
00:31:24,976 --> 00:31:26,744
<i>Ã  la Joan Crawford
in</i> Mommie Dearest... 

749
00:31:26,745 --> 00:31:28,228
<i>the height of glamour.</i>

750
00:31:28,229 --> 00:31:29,263
<i>Find something cute to wear.</i>

751
00:31:29,264 --> 00:31:30,714
<i>Text my dads to let them know</i>

752
00:31:30,715 --> 00:31:32,216
<i>I'm almost ready
for my evening tea...</i>

753
00:31:32,217 --> 00:31:33,734
<i>well, we'll skip
that one tonight.</i>

754
00:31:33,735 --> 00:31:35,443
<i>Then condition
and brush my hair.</i>

755
00:31:35,444 --> 00:31:37,737
Hi.
Hi.

756
00:31:37,738 --> 00:31:39,907
Hey, I-I kind of need to use the
bathroom; it was a really big meal.

757
00:31:41,326 --> 00:31:43,285
No, you can't do that here.

758
00:31:43,286 --> 00:31:44,411
Where am I supposed to do it?

759
00:31:44,412 --> 00:31:46,538
Um, at your house?

760
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:47,998
Hilarious... I'm just
gonna jump in beside you.

761
00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:48,957
I don't mind if you stay.

762
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:50,417
Oh, for God's sakes, Finn.

763
00:31:50,418 --> 00:31:52,069
Can't you at least try to keep
some sort of mystery

764
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,253
until we're married?

765
00:31:53,254 --> 00:31:54,921
What do you think it's gonna
be like in New York?

766
00:31:54,922 --> 00:31:56,340
We'll be on opposite
schedules, so, you know,

767
00:31:56,341 --> 00:31:57,875
you can use the bathroom
while I'm at school

768
00:31:57,876 --> 00:32:00,135
and I'll use it when you're
at... when you're working

769
00:32:00,136 --> 00:32:01,344
or what-whatever.

770
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:05,056
What's that supposed
to mean?

771
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:06,583
You don't think I'm gonna be
doing anything in New York?

772
00:32:06,584 --> 00:32:08,268
You think I'm just gonna be
around to bring you Diet Cokes

773
00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:09,311
and cheer you on?

774
00:32:09,312 --> 00:32:10,554
RACHEL (muffled):
I knew it.

775
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:11,605
I knew one day
you'd be intimidated

776
00:32:11,606 --> 00:32:12,689
by my success,
but I didn't think

777
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,941
it would be before we graduated.

778
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:18,229
Where are you going?

779
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,763
The bathroom downstairs.

780
00:32:19,764 --> 00:32:21,598
I can guarantee one thing
you're not gonna have to add

781
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:23,450
to your little crazy-town
nighttime ritual...

782
00:32:23,451 --> 00:32:25,152
getting into
bed with me.

783
00:32:29,374 --> 00:32:31,235
(Sighs)

784
00:32:38,481 --> 00:32:41,149
FYI, we got a private
party here tonight, hon.

785
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,720
Oh, I know, I know,
I'm, I'm early.

786
00:32:43,721 --> 00:32:47,039
Well, according to
this, I'm, I'm early.

787
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,933
I'm supposed to be
meeting my cutie here

788
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:49,976
for a long overdue
reunion,

789
00:32:49,977 --> 00:32:53,438
but I, uh, I guess
he didn't make it.

790
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:55,514
Wouldn't be too sure
about that.

791
00:32:59,443 --> 00:33:01,363
I knew it!

792
00:33:01,364 --> 00:33:03,606
Oh, See's candies!

793
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:06,284
"Dear Kurt,
Happy Valentine's Day.

794
00:33:06,285 --> 00:33:07,661
I think I love you."

795
00:33:07,662 --> 00:33:09,746
Wait. You <i>think</i> you love me?

796
00:33:15,652 --> 00:33:17,486
Karofsky.

797
00:33:19,213 --> 00:33:22,550
So, you tormented me,
shoved me into lockers,

798
00:33:22,551 --> 00:33:24,552
called me horrible names and

799
00:33:24,553 --> 00:33:26,971
hate-kissed me.

800
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:28,473
Now, after one conversation

801
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:30,475
in a bar, you want us
to be together?

802
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:33,436
When I was at McKinley,
I hated who I was.

803
00:33:33,437 --> 00:33:35,587
I took that out
on you because...

804
00:33:35,588 --> 00:33:38,900
there you were, so proud.

805
00:33:38,901 --> 00:33:42,237
I've wanted to call you since
that night at Scandals, and,

806
00:33:42,238 --> 00:33:44,563
look, it's taken me a while,

807
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,682
but for the first time
in my life,

808
00:33:46,683 --> 00:33:50,912
I'm trying to be honest
about what I feel.

809
00:33:50,913 --> 00:33:54,332
And I'm flattered,
I... I-I really am, but

810
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,584
David, you just think
that you love me.

811
00:33:56,585 --> 00:33:58,128
You don't really love me.

812
00:33:58,129 --> 00:34:00,529
Oh, you've helped me so much,
Kurt, you don't know.

813
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,081
I haven't come out
at school yet,

814
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:03,449
but maybe I will next year.

815
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:04,759
David, look,

816
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,470
I am so proud of you for...
for coming so far.

817
00:34:07,471 --> 00:34:09,889
And I want you
to be happy and...

818
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:11,674
and you will be happy,

819
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:13,542
but I'm with Blaine.

820
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,714
A-And... I like you.

821
00:34:18,715 --> 00:34:20,984
But just as friends.

822
00:34:20,985 --> 00:34:22,777
I should go.

823
00:34:22,778 --> 00:34:25,554
Wait.
Now, you don't have to go.

824
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:28,891
I hope you like the candies.

825
00:34:28,892 --> 00:34:30,976
The butterscotch ones
are my favorite.

826
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:35,457
Mine, too.

827
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:37,500
Hey, Karofsky.
Nick.

828
00:34:37,501 --> 00:34:39,753
You guys hanging out
for Valentine's Day?

829
00:34:39,754 --> 00:34:40,986
No. No.

830
00:34:40,987 --> 00:34:43,555
No, no. We-We used
to go to the same school.

831
00:34:43,556 --> 00:34:45,133
We just bumped
into each other.

832
00:34:45,134 --> 00:34:47,260
- That's exactly what it looked like.
- I gotta go.

833
00:34:47,261 --> 00:34:50,013
David...
I'll talk to you later.

834
00:34:50,014 --> 00:34:52,081
(laughs)

835
00:34:54,834 --> 00:34:56,919
I'm really glad we
kissed and made up.

836
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,637
I mean, it is Valentine's
Day, after all.

837
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,339
Mm-hmm.

838
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,341
This whole living
together thing

839
00:35:02,342 --> 00:35:04,459
and being right on
top of one another...

840
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:07,096
it's definitely a lot more
challenging than I thought.

841
00:35:07,097 --> 00:35:08,564
It's like real
life and stuff.

842
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:09,932
I know.

843
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:11,183
I have to be honest.

844
00:35:11,184 --> 00:35:13,135
I was a little...

845
00:35:13,136 --> 00:35:16,498
afraid of what it would be like
for us to really be married.

846
00:35:16,499 --> 00:35:17,740
I don't know.

847
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,250
I think we can
do it, right?

848
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:21,693
I think we can.

849
00:35:23,179 --> 00:35:24,997
Good.

850
00:35:26,149 --> 00:35:27,482
Mm.

851
00:35:27,483 --> 00:35:29,219
Mm.
Mm.

852
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:33,655
Except for one thing.

853
00:35:33,656 --> 00:35:35,600
It's 7:15.
No way.

854
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:37,259
Yeah.

855
00:35:39,462 --> 00:35:41,346
You want to go to Breadstix?

856
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:43,048
I was hoping you'd say that.

857
00:35:43,049 --> 00:35:44,216
Let's go.

858
00:35:45,718 --> 00:35:47,737
LeROY:
I like

859
00:35:47,738 --> 00:35:49,531
Carole after three
Chardonnays.

860
00:35:49,532 --> 00:35:51,699
Shh. Listen, listen.

861
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,508
Shh. Listen.

862
00:35:55,202 --> 00:35:56,511
Silence.

863
00:35:56,512 --> 00:35:57,956
They're not fighting anymore.

864
00:35:57,957 --> 00:35:59,165
It's not working.

865
00:35:59,166 --> 00:36:00,416
What, is he defiling
our baby?

866
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:02,701
- Do you need a Xanax?
- I already took three.

867
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,420
This is a stupid plan.
We've never

868
00:36:04,421 --> 00:36:05,964
lied to her
like this before.

869
00:36:05,965 --> 00:36:08,508
Honesty, respect, dance...

870
00:36:08,509 --> 00:36:10,176
those are the foundations
of the Berry family.

871
00:36:10,177 --> 00:36:12,512
These are desperate times.

872
00:36:12,513 --> 00:36:13,805
Every teenager does

873
00:36:13,806 --> 00:36:16,141
the exact opposite
of what their parents tell them.

874
00:36:16,142 --> 00:36:19,394
I don't know where she got
this idea of marriage anyway,

875
00:36:19,395 --> 00:36:22,522
but she's not going
to go through with it.

876
00:36:22,523 --> 00:36:26,609
She is a little girl
with big dreams...

877
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,570
It's too bad. I like Finn.

878
00:36:28,571 --> 00:36:32,282
Nobody is saying that
they have to break up.

879
00:36:32,283 --> 00:36:34,450
They're just too
young to get married.

880
00:36:34,451 --> 00:36:37,537
As long as we continue
to do what we're doing...

881
00:36:37,538 --> 00:36:41,106
lying about supporting it
utterly and completely...

882
00:36:41,107 --> 00:36:43,209
she'll come around, and
she'll see it our way.

883
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:44,836
It's reverse psychology.

884
00:36:44,837 --> 00:36:46,921
- It's the only way.
- RACHEL: Hey.

885
00:36:46,922 --> 00:36:48,506
We're gonna go
go Breadstix.

886
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:50,758
We decided that we want to just
be with our friends tonight.

887
00:36:50,759 --> 00:36:53,303
And then I'm probably
just gonna go home after.

888
00:36:53,304 --> 00:36:54,953
R-Really?

889
00:36:54,954 --> 00:36:57,849
Yeah, we thought we heard
you guys squabbling up there.

890
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:00,226
Cohabitating is
not-not-not so easy, huh?

891
00:37:00,227 --> 00:37:02,187
LeROY: I hope this
little experiment

892
00:37:02,188 --> 00:37:06,524
doesn't cause you to postpone
the marriage for a few months?

893
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:08,851
- HIRAM: Right, or years.
- Don't do that.

894
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,195
Actually, it's the opposite.

895
00:37:10,196 --> 00:37:11,654
We just decided
that, you know,

896
00:37:11,655 --> 00:37:14,115
since it's gonna take us
a little while to get used

897
00:37:14,116 --> 00:37:17,285
to one another, that we might
as well just, you know,

898
00:37:17,286 --> 00:37:18,694
get started.

899
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:20,262
We're getting
married in May!

900
00:37:20,263 --> 00:37:21,456
Right-Right after Nationals!

901
00:37:21,457 --> 00:37:22,540
It's gonna be a
spring wedding.

902
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:24,266
(Rachel laughs)

903
00:37:24,267 --> 00:37:27,319
I'll talk to you guys more about
it when I get home tonight.

904
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,463
I'm so excited.
(Hiram mutters)

905
00:37:28,464 --> 00:37:30,298
- And I love you both very much.
- Love you

906
00:37:30,299 --> 00:37:31,606
so much.

907
00:37:31,607 --> 00:37:34,385
Okay, well, I'll be
back in a little while.

Hi. My name's Joe.
Santana Lopez asked me

931
00:38:26,355 --> 00:38:27,770
if the God Squad
would sing a love song

932
00:38:27,771 --> 00:38:29,071
for Brittany S. Pierce.

933
00:38:29,072 --> 00:38:30,739
And after thinking
and praying about it,

934
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,068
I knew there was only one
right answer.

935
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:35,744
Absolutely.

936
00:38:35,745 --> 00:38:36,945
