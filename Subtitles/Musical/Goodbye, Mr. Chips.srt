As always, we will start
with the school song.

2
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:10,822
For what we are about to receive,
may the Lord make us truly thankful.

3
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:12,865

- Forbes.
- Sir.

69
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,131
Fortesque.

70
00:08:43,908 --> 00:08:47,048
Isn't this a rather unusual action
for you to take, Chipping?

71
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:48,622
I suppose it is, headmaster...

72
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:52,488
...but my class's examination results
this term were also rather unusual.

73
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,358
I've looked at them.
They were only a little below average.

74
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,329
Yes, that, for a class of mine,
is rather unusual.

75
00:08:58,489 --> 00:09:00,491
- It's a punishment?
-Oh, no.

76
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:02,766
I trust nobody thinks that.

77
00:09:02,927 --> 00:09:05,237
- Baxter does.
-Well, he's wrong.

78
00:09:05,396 --> 00:09:09,503
I want to take my boys over their exam in
some detail and show them their mistakes.

79
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:11,613
It should be a very helpful session.

80
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:15,080
Quite so.
Unhappily, there's this tennis match.

81
00:09:15,239 --> 00:09:17,116
Sutterwick's results
are among the worst.

82
00:09:17,274 --> 00:09:20,653
Even if they weren't, I should
still think it wrong to make an exception.

83
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:23,155
Don't know what
Sutterwick's father's going to say.

84
00:09:23,314 --> 00:09:27,387
I do. Something very smooth,
very offensive and quite beside the point.

85
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,997
- You know him?
-I taught him.

86
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:33,294
You know that he is the generous donor
of our new playing fields.

87
00:09:33,457 --> 00:09:34,492
Most generous.

88
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:37,696
I know he has a great deal of money
to be generous with.

89
00:09:38,562 --> 00:09:44,171
- You won't let me persuade you to--
-No, but you can older me to.

90
00:09:45,736 --> 00:09:47,306
Oh, well.

91
00:09:47,471 --> 00:09:49,246
I'll be seeing you tonight for dinner?

92
00:09:49,407 --> 00:09:52,445
Yes, headmaster.
I'm very much looking forward to it.

93
00:09:58,883 --> 00:10:01,693
Do people think
I really want to be disliked?

94
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:02,887
Who thinks that?

95
00:10:03,054 --> 00:10:06,365
Baxter, for one.
He plainly thinks I'm a bloody sadist.

96
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:09,733
My dear fellow, that's the first time
I ever heard you swear.

97
00:10:09,894 --> 00:10:12,898
There has to be a first time
for everything.

98
00:10:15,132 --> 00:10:17,032
I don't think the boys do dislike you.

99
00:10:17,134 --> 00:10:18,169
Yes, they do.

100
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,271
I can't blame them.

101
00:10:19,372 --> 00:10:21,657
If I were one of them,
I'd dislike myself, I think.

102
00:10:21,772 --> 00:10:24,446
- You must not exaggerate, my dear fellow.
-I don't.

103
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:28,021
- The boys are quite right to dislike failures.
-Now you do exaggerate.

104
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:29,658
A man whose textbook on Pindar--

105
00:10:29,814 --> 00:10:31,293
What is worse than a teacher...

106
00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:34,896
...who can't make his pupils grasp
the importance of what he has to teach?

107
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,827
- Can you answer me that?
-Yes.

108
00:10:36,987 --> 00:10:40,298
A teacher who doesn't try to, like Baxter.

109
00:10:41,692 --> 00:10:43,603
Rather true, Max.

110
00:10:43,961 --> 00:10:45,736
Thank you.

111
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,110
Look out, it's Old Blood and Iron.

112
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:53,577
That's just their humour.

113
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:54,772
Yes.

114
00:10:54,939 --> 00:10:57,351
- What do they call you?
-"Ditchie."

115
00:10:57,508 --> 00:10:59,715
Ditchie? That's not too bad.

116
00:10:59,877 --> 00:11:04,917
It's short for "ditchwater,"
and that is a simile for "dull."

117
00:11:27,805 --> 00:11:29,079
Good morning.

118
00:11:31,475 --> 00:11:33,216
Sit down.

119
00:11:36,881 --> 00:11:37,916
Suttelwick?

120
00:11:39,683 --> 00:11:43,927
You seem to have chosen
rather an eccentric costume for class.

121
00:11:44,688 --> 00:11:47,601
I'm playing in the final
of the junior tennis competition.

122
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:49,733
At what time?

123
00:11:50,194 --> 00:11:51,434
Twelve-thirty, sir.

124
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:54,469
At 12:30, you will still be in class,
Sutterwick.

125
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:57,238
- I thought I told you.
- Mr. Baxter said I could play.

126
00:11:57,401 --> 00:11:58,505
Did I tell you?

127
00:11:58,669 --> 00:12:00,512
The period is supposed to end at 12.

128
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:04,585
It ends when I say it ends, Sutterwick,
and that is 1 .

129
00:12:04,742 --> 00:12:06,722
When the bell rings at 12, I'm going, sir.

130
00:12:06,877 --> 00:12:09,687
You've no light
to keep the others in either.

131
00:12:11,682 --> 00:12:15,459
I have two kinds of right, Sutterwick.

132
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:19,658
The right which would be translated
into Latin by the word fas---

133
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:22,201
...meaning a sacred duty...

134
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:25,465
...and the light
which is given me by power.

135
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:27,631
The first
I don't expect you to understand.

136
00:12:27,798 --> 00:12:29,175
The second, I do.

137
00:12:30,034 --> 00:12:31,980
Sit down, please.

138
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:40,789
Your Homer, page 56, line 17.
Simpson, will you begin?

139
00:12:42,246 --> 00:12:45,352
"Yea, I will tell thee clearly
and say but the truth.

140
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:48,723
Mentes, I boast to be Anchialus' son.

141
00:12:48,886 --> 00:12:52,698
And among the Taphians.
men of the oar, I am king.

142
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:53,891
I came hither--"

143
00:12:54,058 --> 00:12:57,164
They think I do nut understand

144
00:12:57,328 --> 00:13:00,434
They think I do not hear or see

145
00:13:00,598 --> 00:13:07,106
I only wish they knew I do understand

146
00:13:07,638 --> 00:13:10,016
I only wish they understood me

147
00:13:10,174 --> 00:13:12,313
"In the haven of Rheithlon."

148
00:13:12,476 --> 00:13:15,150
That is remarkably fluent, Simpson...

149
00:13:16,247 --> 00:13:18,887
...but I think I would prefer the words
to be your own...

150
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:22,292
...rather than those of Professor Jacobs'
Easy Guide to the Classics.

151
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:26,333
Would you be good to detach the page from
that work that you've glued to your book?

152
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:30,233
Hand it to me.
Take 25 punishment lines and proceed.

153
00:13:39,837 --> 00:13:42,545
My dear Baxter,
what an absurd fuss over a game of tennis.

154
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:45,118
A game of tennis?
It is the final of the junior cup.

155
00:13:45,276 --> 00:13:48,155
It's still a game of pat-ball
with a piece of framed catgut...

156
00:13:48,312 --> 00:13:50,986
...an unworthy subject
for a quarrel between housemasters.

157
00:13:51,148 --> 00:13:53,822
When you make jokes to Baxter
against tennis, better duck.

158
00:13:53,984 --> 00:13:57,056
He didn't only get a tennis blue at Oxford,
he got a boxing blue.

159
00:13:57,221 --> 00:13:59,428
- Also first-class honours in physics.
-Biology.

160
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,196
And we don't say honours in this country.
just degree.

161
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:03,394
I'm sorry.

162
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,007
Fenwick, I disagree with you profoundly
upon the importance of this issue.

163
00:14:07,164 --> 00:14:10,839
To deprive Sutterwick of the chance,
just because that pernickety old idiot...

164
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:14,278
...has taken it into his head
to give his form an hour's extra tuition.

165
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:16,611
On the last day of term? Heh, heh.

166
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:18,048
Chipping's a brave man.

167
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:23,385
"Wine-dark sea" is a perfectly
acceptable description of the Aegean Sea.

168
00:14:23,547 --> 00:14:26,118
I agree Homer does use it lather a lot...

169
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:29,560
...but then there are some epithets
we all use lather a lot, don't we?

170
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,328
I believe your favourite is "stinky."

171
00:14:34,925 --> 00:14:36,302
Isn't it?

172
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:42,740
Forgive me if I prefer Homer's
more colourful imagery.

173
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,641
Twelve o'clock, I see, Sutterwick.

174
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:47,510
- Sir?
-Come here, would you?

175
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:59,423
Just distribute these around the class.
would you?

176
00:14:59,883 --> 00:15:01,885
To each boy.

177
00:15:09,626 --> 00:15:12,038
I think you'll find them all clearly marked.

178
00:15:22,806 --> 00:15:25,150
I won. I won.

179
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:27,084
I'm the champion.

180
00:15:27,244 --> 00:15:29,850
I'm the junior tennis champion.

181
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:34,519
The Lex Canuleia...

182
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:39,759
...is not, as Colley Minor seems to think,
a law regulating canals...

183
00:15:39,923 --> 00:15:43,996
...but a law that permitted Roman patricians
to marry plebeians.

184
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,238
An easy way to remember it...

185
00:15:46,397 --> 00:15:50,539
...is to imagine a Miss Plebeian
wishing to many a Mr. Patrician...

186
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:53,307
...and Mr. Patrician saying he can't.

187
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:59,512
She could then reply.
"Oh, yes, you can, you liar."

188
00:16:09,253 --> 00:16:11,460
Well, boys, I've finished.

189
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:16,269
You've all hated me for this, I know,
but I am paid to teach you...

190
00:16:16,794 --> 00:16:20,298
...and your parents pay Brookfield
for you to learn.

191
00:16:20,464 --> 00:16:23,240
We have a mutual duty, in fact...

192
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:27,476
...and it's not a duty that I, for one,
am prepared to betray.

193
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:31,683
This is goodbye for 10 weeks.

194
00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:35,988
May I wish you all a happy holiday.

195
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:40,019
You may go.

196
00:16:53,464 --> 00:16:55,034
Yesterday, I was their age

197
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,304
Tomorrow, they'll be my age

198
00:16:57,468 --> 00:17:01,780
Sooner, much sooner than they know

199
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:04,010
And suddenly they will ask

200
00:17:04,174 --> 00:17:07,212
What every child must ask

201
00:17:08,378 --> 00:17:15,387
Where did my childhood go?

202
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:24,434
Where did my childhood go?

203
00:17:25,362 --> 00:17:30,368
When did my youth, sweet and free

204
00:17:30,534 --> 00:17:35,506
Suddenly slip away from me?

205
00:17:35,672 --> 00:17:39,245
Was it so long ago?

206
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:44,422
Where did my childhood go?

207
00:17:47,518 --> 00:17:51,762
When did the magic end?

208
00:17:52,122 --> 00:17:56,764
When did the future meet the past?

209
00:17:56,927 --> 00:18:01,637
Ending a dream too good to last

210
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:06,304
Taking away our friend

211
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:10,976
When did my childhood end?

212
00:18:14,578 --> 00:18:19,357
Was it that day in early spring

213
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,860
That lingers on

214
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:26,065
When somehow I knew

215
00:18:26,223 --> 00:18:32,367
This precious time would soon be gone?

216
00:18:33,964 --> 00:18:38,435
What does the future show?

217
00:18:38,936 --> 00:18:44,181
Spring will return again next year

218
00:18:44,341 --> 00:18:49,120
And when she does
She'll find me here

219
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:51,725
Wondering still

220
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:53,691
I know

221
00:18:54,985 --> 00:18:59,161
Where did my childhood go?

222
00:19:02,926 --> 00:19:04,633
Yesterday, I was their age

223
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:07,071
Tomorrow, they'll be my age

224
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,906
Sooner, much sooner than they know

225
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:14,174
And suddenly they will ask

226
00:19:14,338 --> 00:19:17,808
What every child must ask

227
00:19:19,142 --> 00:19:25,491
Where did my childhood

228
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:28,425
Go?

229
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:36,465
Over by the new playing fields.
That is, if you ever get them.

230
00:19:36,627 --> 00:19:40,370
Especially as this year.
I've been invited to shoot at Dumlochspey.

231
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,873
Dumlochspey?

232
00:19:42,032 --> 00:19:44,808
Where are you going for your holiday,
Mr. Chipping?

233
00:19:44,968 --> 00:19:48,245
To the new excavations at Pompeii.

234
00:19:48,405 --> 00:19:49,543
Pompeii?

235
00:19:49,706 --> 00:19:53,882
- But won't that be hot at this time of year?
- Yes.

236
00:19:54,044 --> 00:19:57,321
He must be in the late 30s by now.
but I always think of him as a boy.

237
00:19:57,481 --> 00:20:01,429
Oh, no, headmaster.
I'm sure you're a very good shot.

238
00:20:01,585 --> 00:20:04,794
- You're staying in London, aren't you?
-Yes, with Johnnie Longbridge.

239
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:06,059
Lord Longbridge? But I--

240
00:20:06,223 --> 00:20:10,433
You're very lucky to have so rich
and hospitable an ex-pupil.

241
00:20:10,594 --> 00:20:13,302
Oh, I don't know, Max.
Charlie was a very nice boy.

242
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:15,841
Quite a good scholar too.
We always got on.

243
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:19,674
- Is he taking you to the Old Vic as usual?
-Wasn't Lord Longbridge married?

244
00:20:19,836 --> 00:20:20,871
- No.
-No.

245
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:22,642
- I ask--
-That was the father.

246
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:24,547
Present Lord Longbridge is unmarried.

247
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,655
- It's the Medea which I wanted to see.
-He's quite young.

248
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:30,849
He's got tickets for something
he wants to see for some reason...

249
00:20:31,014 --> 00:20:34,427
...called, apparently.
Flossie from Fulham.

250
00:20:34,584 --> 00:20:36,291
But you're very lucky, Mr. Chipping.

251
00:20:36,453 --> 00:20:38,228
My dear fellow, that is most shocking.

252
00:20:38,388 --> 00:20:39,992
Am I, indeed, Mrs. Summersthwaite?

253
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:44,003
It's a divine show, quite divine.
and a very big hit.

254
00:20:46,196 --> 00:20:47,231
Hit?

255
00:20:47,397 --> 00:20:49,741
- That means a success.
-Does it?

256
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,780
Flossie from Fulham is a divine show,
and you'll adore it.

257
00:20:53,937 --> 00:20:55,678
Oh, splendid.

258
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:59,011
But Medea, Max, isn't it a shame?

259
00:20:59,112 --> 00:21:01,118
I wonder if I could get Johnnie
to change his mind.

260
00:21:14,658 --> 00:21:17,832
I'm looking forward like mad
to seeing this extravaganza.

261
00:21:17,994 --> 00:21:21,237
I'm sorry, Chips. I know very well
what you'd rather be seeing...

262
00:21:21,398 --> 00:21:24,470
...but I had to bring you
to meet the gill I intend to many.

263
00:21:25,836 --> 00:21:27,645
You're not serious, surely.

264
00:21:27,804 --> 00:21:30,410
- You did say marry?
-Oh, yes, if she'll have me.

265
00:21:30,574 --> 00:21:33,714
I'm standing, at the moment.
lather low on her list.

266
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:37,415
I'm sure she's utterly delightful,
but think of your name, your position...

267
00:21:37,581 --> 00:21:41,085
...those Shakespeare first folios
in the library at Charworth.

268
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,628
Dear Chips, I'm awfully fond of you.

269
00:21:50,694 --> 00:21:52,867
- Why?
- I say, a treasure hunt in Fulham.

270
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:54,508
- What a capital idea.
- Why what?

271
00:21:54,664 --> 00:21:58,237
- Blimey, Ben, look at them--
Why are you awfully fond of me?

272
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:01,211
Where is the owner of this fish stole?

273
00:22:01,805 --> 00:22:03,944
- Yeah, where's Flossie?
-Flossie?

274
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:20,565
I say, what an absolute corker you are,
dear Miss Fish Stall Owner.

275
00:22:20,724 --> 00:22:22,397
Plainly, the femme fatale of Fulham.

276
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,506
Oh, wherever did you come from,
all dressed up so la-di-da?

277
00:22:25,662 --> 00:22:27,972
Oh, the West End of London.

278
00:22:28,131 --> 00:22:31,271
Well, as long as it's London.
it's all light with me.

279
00:22:33,737 --> 00:22:36,149
Ems stands in Piccadilly Circus

280
00:22:36,306 --> 00:22:41,278
Nelson stands in Trafalgar Square

281
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:43,549
Big Ben stands by the River Thames

282
00:22:43,713 --> 00:22:48,992
And will as long as the Thames is there

283
00:22:49,152 --> 00:22:54,500
London is a strange, unchanging town

284
00:22:55,058 --> 00:22:59,473
And take my word
Whatever you've heard

285
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:02,337
London Bridge has no intention

286
00:23:02,499 --> 00:23:08,711
Of falling down

287
00:23:08,872 --> 00:23:11,148
Oh, London is London

288
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:13,413
ls anyone in doubt about it?

289
00:23:13,577 --> 00:23:15,181
London is London

290
00:23:15,345 --> 00:23:17,450
It's easy to find out about it

291
00:23:17,614 --> 00:23:19,423
London is springtime

292
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:21,392
Cockney champagne

293
00:23:21,551 --> 00:23:23,428
London is summer

294
00:23:23,587 --> 00:23:25,658
Lots of rain
but who's complaining?

295
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:27,358
London is lovely

296
00:23:27,524 --> 00:23:29,765
Let no one change his mind about it

297
00:23:29,926 --> 00:23:31,371
Lovely and lively

298
00:23:31,528 --> 00:23:33,633
Yes, that's the thing I find about it

299
00:23:33,797 --> 00:23:37,677
You can have Paris
And Venice and Rome

300
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:41,509
But London is London
ls London is England

301
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:43,947
Is home

302
00:23:50,046 --> 00:23:53,960
London is London
Forgive me if I shout about it

303
00:23:54,117 --> 00:23:58,031
Nowhere 's like London
So mighty roundabout about it

304
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:02,068
London is history
Future and past

305
00:24:02,225 --> 00:24:04,296
London is mystery

306
00:24:04,461 --> 00:24:09,467
Flabbergasting, everlasting

307
00:24:09,633 --> 00:24:13,547
London is a charmer

308
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:17,810
I could go on for days about it

309
00:24:18,441 --> 00:24:21,786
Dripping with drama

310
00:24:21,945 --> 00:24:26,360
There just ain't no two ways about it

311
00:24:26,516 --> 00:24:31,795
You can have Cairo and Cannes

312
00:24:31,955 --> 00:24:34,196
And Capri

313
00:24:34,357 --> 00:24:37,861
- But London is London
CHORUS 'l: London is

314
00:24:38,028 --> 00:24:40,565
Landon is
Landon

315
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,937
Is England

316
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,406
Is me

317
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:54,051
- London
London is London

318
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,087
There's such a lovely style about it

319
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:58,021
- London
London is London

320
00:24:58,181 --> 00:25:00,024
You can't resist
Just smile about it

321
00:25:00,183 --> 00:25:03,995
London is history
Future and past

322
00:25:04,154 --> 00:25:08,000
London is mystery
Flabbergasting, everlasting

323
00:25:08,158 --> 00:25:11,970
London is London
Random people rave about it

324
00:25:12,128 --> 00:25:13,801
London, my London

325
00:25:13,964 --> 00:25:16,035
There's something people crave about it

326
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:19,737
Others may pine
For a trip up the Rhine

327
00:25:19,903 --> 00:25:25,546
Or follow the sun
Where it happens to shine

328
00:25:25,709 --> 00:25:27,985
The tip of the parties

329
00:25:28,144 --> 00:25:31,819
The home where the heart is

330
00:25:36,553 --> 00:25:41,059
And Landon is Landon

331
00:25:41,224 --> 00:25:46,572
Is England

332
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:52,442
Is mine

333
00:26:02,612 --> 00:26:04,148
Why the hell do we come here?

334
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:06,385
Because we always come here.

335
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:07,619
Exactly.

336
00:26:07,784 --> 00:26:09,923
What's the matter with you tonight?

337
00:26:10,086 --> 00:26:12,123
Good evening.

338
00:26:13,757 --> 00:26:15,600
But she's got young Calbury with her.

339
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:16,999
Calbury?

340
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:20,202
Some idiot in the Horse Guards.

341
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:22,404
Damn it, Chips, we've been stood up.

342
00:26:22,565 --> 00:26:24,374
Stood UP?

343
00:26:25,068 --> 00:26:26,342
She' s forgotten .

344
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:28,710
Oh, dear. I am sorry.

345
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:31,846
Oh, Johnnie Longbridge.

346
00:26:32,976 --> 00:26:35,320
Oh, my God. I've stood him up.
I must get him over.

347
00:26:35,478 --> 00:26:36,616
Not to stay.

348
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:40,385
Come on, Chips.

349
00:26:43,086 --> 00:26:44,861
What will you think of me?

350
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:47,627
Nothing. Except that
you're a terrible muddler of dates.

351
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:49,202
And I've known that for ages.

352
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:51,930
Bill Calbury you know, of course.

353
00:26:52,462 --> 00:26:54,601
He was suddenly in town again, and...

354
00:26:54,764 --> 00:26:56,505
Oh, no, no, don't apologize, darling.

355
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:59,112
Oh, but you came
to see the show especially tonight.

356
00:26:59,269 --> 00:27:00,373
My fifth time.

357
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:02,744
This is Chips.
I told you about him, remember?

358
00:27:02,906 --> 00:27:03,976
Of course.

359
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,983
Hasn't he any other name?

360
00:27:06,142 --> 00:27:08,179
Well, if he has, I can't remember it.

361
00:27:08,611 --> 00:27:10,557
Then I'd better call you Mr. Chips.

362
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:12,852
That's a nice name.
How do you do, Mr. Chips?

363
00:27:13,016 --> 00:27:14,359
How do you do, Miss Bridges?

364
00:27:14,517 --> 00:27:16,622
This is Bill Calbury.

365
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,327
Do join us.

366
00:27:31,101 --> 00:27:33,377
Oh, Chips absolutely adored the show.

367
00:27:33,536 --> 00:27:34,981
I'm so glad.

368
00:27:35,138 --> 00:27:36,947
Oh, yes, I loved it.

369
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:40,445
It's a great hit, isn't it?

370
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,681
We've been running for over a year.

371
00:27:42,846 --> 00:27:44,291
Over a year?

372
00:27:44,447 --> 00:27:45,790
Yes.

373
00:27:45,949 --> 00:27:47,257
Every night?

374
00:27:48,852 --> 00:27:51,799
Well, we get Sundays off.

375
00:27:52,689 --> 00:27:54,430
But don't you get most awfully bored?

376
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:57,936
I mean, isn't it an awful strain for you,
all that leaping?

377
00:27:58,094 --> 00:28:00,700
Oh, yes, I loved it.

378
00:28:01,464 --> 00:28:05,276
The plot I found a shade tortuous...

379
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:08,439
...but the exposition of it,
remarkably adroit.

380
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:09,640
Good.

381
00:28:10,807 --> 00:28:13,287
Did you like anything else?

382
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,153
Ah.

383
00:28:15,645 --> 00:28:19,457
Well, the denouement...

384
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:22,961
...l found quite remarkable
when you turned out...

385
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:25,759
...to be the real Lady Lettie all along.

386
00:28:25,922 --> 00:28:27,424
No, that's Edna Lovelace.

387
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:30,799
I tum out
to be William C. Belfrage's ward.

388
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,171
Ah, yes, the multimillionaire shop owner.

389
00:28:37,066 --> 00:28:39,410
Of course, how stupid of me.

390
00:28:40,603 --> 00:28:44,016
But then, you and the other lady
do look alike.

391
00:28:45,775 --> 00:28:48,255
Yes, I suppose we do.

392
00:28:48,411 --> 00:28:51,255
She's 53 next birthday.

393
00:28:52,048 --> 00:28:56,326
You astound me, and sing so well.

394
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:59,466
I think we should go back to our table.

395
00:28:59,622 --> 00:29:02,330
Goodbye, Katie. Marvelous seeing you.

396
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:04,233
Goodbye.

397
00:29:04,561 --> 00:29:05,835
Goodbye, Miss Bridges.

398
00:29:07,063 --> 00:29:08,508
Goodbye, Mr. Chips.

399
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:16,407
What an idiotic bore.

400
00:29:16,573 --> 00:29:18,780
Bill, you were asking me
something important.

401
00:29:18,942 --> 00:29:22,219
You were asking me
whether I seriously believed something.

402
00:29:24,814 --> 00:29:29,024
They tell me they make
a delicious oyster stew here.

403
00:29:30,653 --> 00:29:33,691
By the way.
how do you know she's not here?

404
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:35,301
She?

405
00:29:35,458 --> 00:29:38,234
The gill tonight's evening news
said you're going to many.

406
00:29:38,394 --> 00:29:41,341
Oh, yes, I saw that.
Me and Penelope Fitzdouglas.

407
00:29:41,497 --> 00:29:43,033
Huh. Wasn't it ridiculous?

408
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:44,576
Sidesplitting.

409
00:29:44,734 --> 00:29:47,374
I'll have the same as last Tuesday.

410
00:29:47,804 --> 00:29:49,715
Yeah, so will I.

411
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:51,545
The same wine?

412
00:29:52,308 --> 00:29:54,151
The same wine.

413
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:04,693
Hey.

414
00:30:04,854 --> 00:30:05,889
Hey.

415
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:07,830
Hey, mister.

416
00:30:07,991 --> 00:30:11,529
Hey, mister, please.

417
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:13,730
Please.

418
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:15,432
Ill...

419
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:20,044
I'll be your guide to Pompeii, okay?

420
00:30:20,203 --> 00:30:26,415
Okay, on your right, is the Greek forum...

421
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:30,615
...which was partially destroyed
in the earthquake of AD 61.

422
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:34,057
Behind you is the statue of Clio.
one of the Muses.

423
00:30:34,217 --> 00:30:35,719
- She had--
-No.

424
00:30:35,885 --> 00:30:37,558
That is Terpsichore...

425
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:43,329
...the Muse of choral dance and song.
and the earthquake was in AD 62.

426
00:30:43,726 --> 00:30:46,172
Okay, mister, you know best.

427
00:30:46,329 --> 00:30:49,242
Actually, dear fellow, I think I do.

428
00:30:51,067 --> 00:30:54,071
Hello, can you hear me up there?

429
00:30:55,138 --> 00:30:56,742
Yes, of course I can.

430
00:30:56,906 --> 00:30:59,750
The acoustics here are famous.

431
00:30:59,909 --> 00:31:01,616
Can you hear me?

432
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:05,658
Yes, but you're shouting.

433
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:08,529
I'm not shouting.

434
00:31:08,685 --> 00:31:12,827
Sound travels upwards
better than downwards.

435
00:31:12,989 --> 00:31:14,696
Could you hear that?

436
00:31:14,857 --> 00:31:16,393
Yes.

437
00:31:17,093 --> 00:31:18,299
What are you eating?

438
00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:21,973
An egg sandwich.

439
00:31:25,435 --> 00:31:28,609
When was the earthquake
that destroyed all this?

440
00:31:28,771 --> 00:31:31,809
It wasn't an earthquake.
It was an eruption of Vesuvius...

441
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:35,183
...behind me.
and it happened in the year 79 AD...

442
00:31:35,345 --> 00:31:37,825
...toward the end of the ides of June.

443
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,085
Ha. I thought only March had ides.

444
00:31:40,249 --> 00:31:42,422
All Roman months had ides.

445
00:31:42,585 --> 00:31:44,656
Calends too.

446
00:31:45,188 --> 00:31:46,724
Ale you a guide?

447
00:31:46,889 --> 00:31:48,698
Do I look like a guide?

448
00:31:49,292 --> 00:31:52,637
I don't know.
I haven't got my field glasses with me.

449
00:31:53,763 --> 00:31:55,174
What are you?

450
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:56,469
A schoolmaster.

451
00:31:56,632 --> 00:31:58,407
Ah, that's cheating.

452
00:31:58,568 --> 00:32:00,912
- What are you?
- A tourist.

453
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:04,984
An ignorant one, as you implied,
who doesn't know her ide from her calend.

454
00:32:05,141 --> 00:32:08,054
There is no singular to either word.

455
00:32:08,211 --> 00:32:10,623
Oh, you can't win, can you?

456
00:32:12,815 --> 00:32:14,692
You eating another sandwich?

457
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:16,455
Yes.

458
00:32:16,719 --> 00:32:19,199
You wouldn't have anything left,
would you?

459
00:32:20,289 --> 00:32:23,202
One egg sandwich and some cheese.

460
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:25,703
I'm coming up. I'm starving.

461
00:32:35,571 --> 00:32:37,016
How do you do?

462
00:32:37,173 --> 00:32:38,481
My name is Chipping.

463
00:32:38,641 --> 00:32:40,678
Mine is Bridges.

464
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:48,688
Golly. Well, one thing's fairly certain.

465
00:32:48,851 --> 00:32:51,024
We'd never be cast opposite each other.

466
00:32:51,187 --> 00:32:53,463
Forgive me, I didn't quite follow that.

467
00:32:53,623 --> 00:32:54,829
It doesn't matter.

468
00:32:54,991 --> 00:32:57,631
Oh, thank you, you're an angel of mercy.

469
00:33:00,296 --> 00:33:01,604
Haven't we met before?

470
00:33:01,764 --> 00:33:03,402
I don't think so. Some of this?

471
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:05,239
Thank you.

472
00:33:07,303 --> 00:33:09,874
Of course, you're Mr. Chips.

473
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:11,245
I beg your pardon?

474
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:14,616
Oh, we met at the Savoy one night,
with Johnnie Longbridge, remember?

475
00:33:14,777 --> 00:33:18,748
I was with somebody called Bill Calbury.
and you said all the wrong things.

476
00:33:18,915 --> 00:33:23,261
Good gracious,
you're not the girl in that awfully...

477
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:27,424
...jolly musical comedy?

478
00:33:31,461 --> 00:33:35,500
Oh, thank you for making me laugh.
It's the first time I have for over a month.

479
00:33:35,665 --> 00:33:36,939
Cheers.

480
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:39,375
Cheers. I didn't mean it as funny.

481
00:33:39,535 --> 00:33:41,879
Well, no, if you had,
I wouldn't have laughed.

482
00:33:42,038 --> 00:33:43,073
This is nice.

483
00:33:43,239 --> 00:33:45,446
I ought to tell you, it's lather strong.

484
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:47,144
Good.

485
00:33:47,944 --> 00:33:49,355
But of course.

486
00:33:49,512 --> 00:33:52,982
You were the gal who turned out
to be the real Lady Lettie all along.

487
00:33:53,149 --> 00:33:54,628
No.

488
00:33:55,685 --> 00:33:59,656
- You've done it again.
-Oh, dear. I'm so sorry.

489
00:33:59,822 --> 00:34:06,239
You are William C. Belfrage's ward.
Miss Katherine Bridges.

490
00:34:06,395 --> 00:34:08,102
Ah, that's wrong too.

491
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:09,966
My real name is not Bridges.

492
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:13,045
My real name is--
Now you won't laugh, will you?

493
00:34:13,703 --> 00:34:15,148
It's Brisket.

494
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:18,645
Charmingly Anglo- Saxon.

495
00:34:20,343 --> 00:34:22,152
What are you doing in Pompeii?

496
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:25,019
I wasn't feeling very well
and they gave me a month off...

497
00:34:25,181 --> 00:34:27,525
...so I booked myself
on this Mediterranean cruise.

498
00:34:27,683 --> 00:34:29,526
My boat stopped at Naples and, uh...

499
00:34:29,685 --> 00:34:33,292
Well, they organized a tour of this place.
Only I hate being conducted.

500
00:34:33,456 --> 00:34:36,403
When I heard there was a theatre,
I slipped off. I'm glad I did.

501
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:38,869
- It's beautiful.
-The other is even better.

502
00:34:39,428 --> 00:34:40,998
Greek theatre.

503
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:44,440
You mean they did plays here
like the one that's on at the Old Vic now?

504
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,238
The Medea? Yes, they did.

505
00:34:46,402 --> 00:34:48,473
I'd like to see that.
I hear it's marvellous.

506
00:34:48,638 --> 00:34:49,810
I do too.

507
00:34:49,972 --> 00:34:52,452
So we'll do it together sometime, huh?

508
00:34:52,608 --> 00:34:53,951
Yes.

509
00:34:54,243 --> 00:34:56,018
Is there lots more to see at Pompeii?

510
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:59,819
Oh, there's a full 10 days
of exhaustive sightseeing...

511
00:34:59,982 --> 00:35:02,758
...and many, many more,
if you include the Herculaneum and--

512
00:35:02,919 --> 00:35:06,332
Well, I've got the lest of the day.
Would you be my guide, Mr. Chips?

513
00:35:08,824 --> 00:35:11,202
Look, doesn't this bore you terribly?

514
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,237
Please, please say if it does,
because".

515
00:35:13,396 --> 00:35:16,343
...I know there's nothing more awful
than being bothered by somebody...

516
00:35:16,499 --> 00:35:18,479
...when you really want
is to be on your own.

517
00:35:18,634 --> 00:35:20,170
Nobody knows that better than me.

518
00:35:20,336 --> 00:35:22,111
Sorry. Than I?

519
00:35:22,271 --> 00:35:24,376
It doesn't bore me at all.

520
00:35:24,941 --> 00:35:27,820
In fact, very much the reverse.

521
00:35:27,977 --> 00:35:32,926
Truth to say, I was feeling
a little lonely myself this afternoon.

522
00:35:34,483 --> 00:35:38,158
This is the temple of Jupiter.

523
00:35:39,155 --> 00:35:41,101
Ale you quite alone on the ship?

524
00:35:41,257 --> 00:35:44,204
I mean, you're not
with any particular friend?

525
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:47,163
No, no particular friend.

526
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:50,504
At the moment,
I'm rather between particular friends.

527
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:53,977
Of course,
you met him that night, didn't you?

528
00:35:54,136 --> 00:35:57,743
Mr. Calbury. Yes, I did.

529
00:35:58,608 --> 00:36:00,281
I'm sorry.

530
00:36:00,443 --> 00:36:02,150
That's all light.

531
00:36:02,311 --> 00:36:05,485
No doubt the sea ail...

532
00:36:07,116 --> 00:36:10,461
Yes. The sea ail has done marvels.

533
00:36:11,887 --> 00:36:13,560
Sorry, am I going too fast for you?

534
00:36:13,723 --> 00:36:16,260
My dear young lady,
I could go as fast as you...

535
00:36:16,425 --> 00:36:19,497
...if I cared to risk a broken ankle
and be carried on a stretcher.

536
00:36:19,662 --> 00:36:23,508
It's extremely foolish to leap around
in a ruined circus like a mountain goat.

537
00:36:23,666 --> 00:36:26,237
Especially in those shoes.
These stones are treacherous.

538
00:36:26,402 --> 00:36:28,313
I'm sure you're very active for your age.

539
00:36:28,471 --> 00:36:30,314
Since you cannot know what my age is...

540
00:36:30,473 --> 00:36:34,285
...your flattering conviction, Miss Bridges,
must be based on a conjectural premise.

541
00:36:36,746 --> 00:36:38,623
You've done it again.

542
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:40,783
Now that's three times
you've made me laugh.

543
00:36:41,183 --> 00:36:44,130
And only this morning.
I really did think I'd never laugh again.

544
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,997
I suppose it's your being a schoolmaster.

545
00:36:49,225 --> 00:36:51,967
I tail to see
what's so laughable about that.

546
00:36:53,562 --> 00:36:56,202
Well, no, it's not laughable.

547
00:36:56,532 --> 00:36:59,536
One doesn't laugh at people
only because they're funny.

548
00:37:00,936 --> 00:37:03,143
Not some people, anyway.

549
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:08,982
Come on. There's so much left to see
before the sun goes down on us.

550
00:37:09,345 --> 00:37:13,555
A million planets
Were swimming in the sky

551
00:37:13,716 --> 00:37:17,425
I only saw the sun

552
00:37:17,586 --> 00:37:21,591
A million faces drifted by

553
00:37:21,757 --> 00:37:26,433
Suddenly, there was one

554
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:30,033
Filling my mind

555
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:35,774
Like the day was filled with sun

556
00:37:36,939 --> 00:37:39,215
Telling my heart

557
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:45,553
My life had just begun

558
00:37:47,149 --> 00:37:53,327
Although it is so many years away

559
00:37:54,323 --> 00:37:59,204
I remember that moment

560
00:38:00,763 --> 00:38:07,271
As though it were yesterday

561
00:38:09,672 --> 00:38:11,982
He smiled

562
00:38:12,141 --> 00:38:14,485
I smiled

563
00:38:14,643 --> 00:38:18,216
We smiled

564
00:38:18,614 --> 00:38:21,117
And the sky

565
00:38:21,283 --> 00:38:26,858
Smiled too

566
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:33,673
We walked, he talked

567
00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:37,208
I talked

568
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:44,074
And the sky was blue

569
00:38:46,509 --> 00:38:53,017
And before the walk was over

570
00:38:55,151 --> 00:39:01,659
I just knew

571
00:39:04,026 --> 00:39:06,802
He smiled

572
00:39:06,962 --> 00:39:09,533
I smiled

573
00:39:09,832 --> 00:39:13,803
We smiled

574
00:39:13,969 --> 00:39:17,075
And the sky

575
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:23,451
Smiled too

576
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:30,688
It was love

577
00:40:05,721 --> 00:40:07,758
What does that mean?

578
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:14,300
"Know yourself."
The watchword of Apollo.

579
00:40:14,897 --> 00:40:16,604
The god of prophecy.

580
00:40:16,765 --> 00:40:19,405
Amongst other things.

581
00:40:20,436 --> 00:40:22,609
Oh, I'm so sorry. Have I tired you out?

582
00:40:23,038 --> 00:40:24,881
No, you have not tiled me out.

583
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,783
I have a large piece of ancient Greece
in my shoe, that's all.

584
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:34,726
Well, it's been really thrilling
to be shown around Paestum...

585
00:40:34,884 --> 00:40:37,524
...by the world's greatest authority
on ancient Greece.

586
00:40:38,587 --> 00:40:43,696
I am not the world's greatest authority
on ancient Greece, just one of them.

587
00:40:48,163 --> 00:40:50,507
I'm going to ask Apollo a question.

588
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:52,646
You mustn't ask a personal question.

589
00:40:52,801 --> 00:40:55,441
Well, not a specific one, like--

590
00:40:55,604 --> 00:40:58,414
Like, "Will Bill Calbury come back to me?"

591
00:40:58,574 --> 00:41:01,748
No, I wouldn't bore Apollo with that,
I promise you.

592
00:41:02,244 --> 00:41:06,021
No, just something general, like,
"What's going to happen to my life?"

593
00:41:06,282 --> 00:41:09,092
Ah. Even that is too specific.

594
00:41:09,251 --> 00:41:10,594
Besides, I could answer that.

595
00:41:10,753 --> 00:41:14,326
A series of, what is it, hits,
a dazzling career?

596
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:16,902
- No.
-What do you mean, no?

597
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:19,437
I mean, no.

598
00:41:20,696 --> 00:41:22,607
Look, Mr. Chips.

599
00:41:22,765 --> 00:41:25,871
Seems to me
you've learned just about everything...

600
00:41:26,035 --> 00:41:28,777
...but you haven't learned
the first thing about me.

601
00:41:28,938 --> 00:41:32,647
Ever heard of a captain
who hates the sea? That's me-- I.

602
00:41:32,808 --> 00:41:35,948
Only with I, me, it's the theatre.

603
00:41:36,111 --> 00:41:39,251
You tell me the show must go on.
and what do I answer?

604
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:40,985
Why?

605
00:41:42,785 --> 00:41:46,164
Now, come on, Apollo, just speak to me.

606
00:41:46,322 --> 00:41:50,361
I'm going to bleak all the rules
and ask you something specific.

607
00:42:08,744 --> 00:42:10,553
Well?

608
00:42:10,713 --> 00:42:12,420
Did he speak?

609
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:14,753
Very clearly.

610
00:42:15,217 --> 00:42:16,423
What did he say?

611
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:22,191
- If I tell, it won't happen.
-That is the new moon, not Apollo.

612
00:42:22,358 --> 00:42:24,497
You won't get me to tell.

613
00:42:30,165 --> 00:42:32,111
Know yourself .

614
00:42:32,534 --> 00:42:34,741
That's quite a watchword.

615
00:42:37,539 --> 00:42:39,485
You're most retentive.

616
00:42:39,641 --> 00:42:42,622
Give me a good line
and I can remember it.

617
00:42:48,917 --> 00:42:51,727
You smiled

618
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:55,393
I smiled

619
00:42:55,557 --> 00:43:00,028
We smiled

620
00:43:00,396 --> 00:43:03,605
And the sky

621
00:43:03,766 --> 00:43:09,375
Smiled too

622
00:43:11,807 --> 00:43:18,315
It was love

623
00:43:19,748 --> 00:43:23,161
They call me Ditchie,
short for "ditchwater, dull as."

624
00:43:23,318 --> 00:43:25,730
They think I'm a bore
and they're probably light.

625
00:43:25,888 --> 00:43:27,333
No, no.

626
00:43:27,589 --> 00:43:29,193
Oh, yes.

627
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:32,066
But I wouldn't mind them
thinking me a bore...

628
00:43:32,227 --> 00:43:36,107
...if I could only get them to see
how much I really do like them...

629
00:43:36,265 --> 00:43:38,245
...and care for them.

630
00:43:38,834 --> 00:43:40,313
I--

631
00:43:42,237 --> 00:43:43,580
What's the matter?

632
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:45,514
I was blowing my nose.

633
00:43:45,674 --> 00:43:47,881
There isn't any law against that, is there?

634
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:50,614
- But I thought you were cry--
-Well, I was.

635
00:43:50,779 --> 00:43:52,850
And there isn't any law
against that either.

636
00:43:53,015 --> 00:43:55,723
- But in heaven's name, why?
-Doesn't matter.

637
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:57,454
Give me some more of that.

638
00:43:57,619 --> 00:44:00,122
Look, this Epomeo
really is most awfully strong.

639
00:44:00,289 --> 00:44:03,532
But if it's gonna make you start
squirting tears all over the table...

640
00:44:03,692 --> 00:44:06,298
just because my pupils
find me a dull teacher...

641
00:44:06,962 --> 00:44:10,341
Oh, heavens.
I really am most awfully sorry.

642
00:44:10,833 --> 00:44:12,073
What 101?

643
00:44:12,234 --> 00:44:14,339
I've been talking so much
about myself...

644
00:44:14,503 --> 00:44:19,248
...I'd completely forgotten
what your problems were...

645
00:44:19,408 --> 00:44:22,321
...and what good reasons
you have to cry.

646
00:44:22,478 --> 00:44:24,549
You must forgive me.

647
00:44:27,015 --> 00:44:29,154
Well done, Mr. Chips.

648
00:44:29,318 --> 00:44:31,355
Quite up to form.

649
00:44:36,325 --> 00:44:39,966
I think you're the nicest man
I've ever met in my life.

650
00:44:43,932 --> 00:44:47,641
Now, faced with that challenge,
what do you think of me?

651
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:49,940
Or do I really want to know?

652
00:44:50,706 --> 00:44:53,346
Yes, I do. Go ahead.

653
00:44:56,211 --> 00:44:59,681
Well, I think Mr. Calbury
is a very foolish man.

654
00:45:00,749 --> 00:45:03,593
Thank you. Go on.

655
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:08,490
There are plenty of other men
besides Mr. Calbury.

656
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:11,929
You're very young.
you're very attractive...

657
00:45:12,094 --> 00:45:14,836
...and you're bound to find
someone else.

658
00:45:15,597 --> 00:45:20,103
Someone who'll realise how lucky he is
and won't ever let you go.

659
00:45:20,769 --> 00:45:22,009
Go on.

660
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:29,320
Someone who'll give you that escape
from the stage that you imply you want.

661
00:45:29,478 --> 00:45:34,223
Someone from quite a different background
than your present one.

662
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:40,293
Someone who happens
to love you very much at this moment.

663
00:45:40,455 --> 00:45:42,366
And when he gets to know you better...

664
00:45:42,524 --> 00:45:48,941
...can, I'm sure, only love you more
and more and more.

665
00:45:52,701 --> 00:45:55,841
Someone, in fact,
like Johnnie Longbridge.

666
00:46:04,746 --> 00:46:08,455
Oh, I've been wanting to do this all evening.
and now I'm going to do it.

667
00:46:08,617 --> 00:46:11,029
Nobody and nothing's going to stop me.

668
00:46:12,588 --> 00:46:14,226
- What?
-This.

669
00:46:18,594 --> 00:46:22,770
Really, Miss Bridges, I hate to say it, but
I think just a touch too much of the wine.

670
00:46:22,931 --> 00:46:27,380
Not a touch too much, a lot too much,
and I feel wonderful.

671
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:29,779
Oh, Mr. Chips.

672
00:46:29,938 --> 00:46:32,282
You really are...

673
00:46:32,441 --> 00:46:33,920
...well...

674
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:36,819
...Mr. Chips.

675
00:46:41,817 --> 00:46:44,161
Oh, what a wonderful day it's been.

676
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:45,354
Yes.

677
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,694
Yes, indeed. Quite wonderful.

678
00:46:48,857 --> 00:46:51,235
Can't we make it a wonderful night too?

679
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:54,373
Ah. Well, as it happens, Miss Bridges...

680
00:46:54,863 --> 00:46:57,776
...for tomorrow,
I have a rather tight curriculum.

681
00:46:57,933 --> 00:46:59,708
Well, loosen it.

682
00:46:59,868 --> 00:47:02,872
Tonight, Mr. Chips,
you and I are going to make whoopee.

683
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:05,380
The term is new to me.

684
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:07,542
What does it mean?

685
00:47:07,709 --> 00:47:10,121
Almost anything, really.

686
00:47:10,746 --> 00:47:12,692
I really must go.

687
00:47:12,848 --> 00:47:16,227
It's been a very, very great pleasure.

688
00:47:16,752 --> 00:47:18,288
It really has.

689
00:47:18,453 --> 00:47:24,631
And may I wish you a very safe
and a very happy journey home.

690
00:47:46,548 --> 00:47:51,327
Apollo, Apollo

691
00:47:52,187 --> 00:47:56,260
You're the god of song

692
00:47:57,092 --> 00:48:01,837
That's what Mr. Chips has told me

693
00:48:01,997 --> 00:48:04,944
He is never wrong

694
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,808
He also says you're the god of prophecy

695
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:14,386
Cassandra's gift was a gift from you

696
00:48:14,543 --> 00:48:19,788
Sn any dream you may care to offer me

697
00:48:19,948 --> 00:48:26,229
Will, I know, come true

698
00:48:26,388 --> 00:48:28,664
Apollo

699
00:48:30,158 --> 00:48:36,666
Is it love?

700
00:48:46,041 --> 00:48:47,952
Brookfield.

701
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:50,522
Brookfield Station .

702
00:49:11,833 --> 00:49:15,838
Seven weeks
Of home sweet home are over

703
00:49:16,004 --> 00:49:17,847
They're over

704
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:21,744
Seven weeks of Mother's cooking

705
00:49:22,878 --> 00:49:24,255
Mother's love

706
00:49:24,413 --> 00:49:26,154
And Mother's looking after

707
00:49:27,249 --> 00:49:29,525
And laughter

708
00:49:31,386 --> 00:49:34,094
And living in clover

709
00:49:34,256 --> 00:49:36,236
Are over

710
00:49:36,391 --> 00:49:42,000
Moreover, '14 weeks of Michaelmas term
Stretch endlessly ahead

711
00:49:42,164 --> 00:49:45,771
Fourteen weeks of nameless horror
Wait to be unfurled

712
00:49:45,934 --> 00:49:49,746
Fourteen weeks of Latin verbs
I wish that I were dead

713
00:49:50,305 --> 00:49:52,251
Fourteen weeks of school cap-tipping

714
00:49:52,407 --> 00:49:55,980
Filthy food and Mr. Chipping

715
00:49:56,411 --> 00:49:59,483
Fourteen weeks in the dungeon

716
00:49:59,648 --> 00:50:05,496
Of a schoolboy's world

717
00:50:09,991 --> 00:50:14,406
But one day

718
00:50:14,563 --> 00:50:17,601
One day

719
00:50:18,366 --> 00:50:20,209
When I am older

720
00:50:20,368 --> 00:50:22,211
I'll be the president of Peru

721
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:23,940
I'll own an emerald mine or two

722
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:26,244
I'll swim for England
In the next Olympic games

723
00:50:26,408 --> 00:50:29,287
When I am older
I'm going to be a playboy farmer

724
00:50:29,444 --> 00:50:31,151
I'm going to be a lady-charmer

725
00:50:31,313 --> 00:50:32,883
I'm gonna be a knight in armour

726
00:50:33,048 --> 00:50:34,755
Find a damsel and disarm her

727
00:50:34,916 --> 00:50:36,827
When I am older

728
00:50:36,985 --> 00:50:38,623
I'll be the multi-est millionaire

729
00:50:38,787 --> 00:50:40,562
I'll be the fellow beyond compare

730
00:50:40,722 --> 00:50:44,829
I'll be the hero
That the populace acclaims

731
00:50:44,993 --> 00:50:48,497
- I'm going to carve the world in pieces
- I'm going to be as rich as Croesus

732
00:50:48,663 --> 00:50:50,506
Think of the mighty empire I shall rule

733
00:50:50,665 --> 00:50:52,235
When I am older

734
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,004
When I am older

735
00:50:54,169 --> 00:50:55,477
Wiser and bolder

736
00:50:55,637 --> 00:50:59,517
On the day that I get out of school

737
00:50:59,674 --> 00:51:01,449
I'm gonna be a fine musician

738
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:03,283
I'm gonna be a rich physician

739
00:51:03,445 --> 00:51:05,118
I'm going to be a politician

740
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,918
I shall be an obstetrician

741
00:51:07,082 --> 00:51:08,789
I'll achieve my great ambition

742
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:10,793
When I am older

743
00:51:10,952 --> 00:51:12,727
I'll be the fellow who makes the rules

744
00:51:12,888 --> 00:51:14,390
I will abolish public schools

745
00:51:14,556 --> 00:51:16,968
I'll be the chairman
Of at least a hundred boards

746
00:51:17,125 --> 00:51:18,832
When I am older

747
00:51:18,994 --> 00:51:22,441
I'll run a fleet of ocean tankers

748
00:51:22,597 --> 00:51:26,170
I'll buy a street of merchant bankers

749
00:51:26,334 --> 00:51:32,842
I'll be the greatest man you've ever seen

750
00:51:33,608 --> 00:51:35,246
When I am older

751
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:38,391
Wiser and bolder

752
00:51:38,547 --> 00:51:44,554
Just as soon as I am 17

753
00:52:12,647 --> 00:52:14,752
Are you for Brookfield?

754
00:52:14,916 --> 00:52:16,554
If I knew where it was.

755
00:52:17,452 --> 00:52:19,022
The other boys didn't tell you?

756
00:52:19,788 --> 00:52:21,096
No.

757
00:52:21,256 --> 00:52:24,430
Well, that happens.

758
00:52:24,726 --> 00:52:27,366
I'm afraid pets aren't allowed.

759
00:52:27,529 --> 00:52:28,564
Oh, no.

760
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:31,973
If they take Delilah from me,
I won't want to live.

761
00:52:32,133 --> 00:52:34,044
Yes, you will.

762
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:37,348
She's very beautiful, Delilah.

763
00:52:37,505 --> 00:52:38,575
Who's your housemaster?

764
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:39,775
Mr. Fenwick.

765
00:52:39,941 --> 00:52:43,184
Oh, good. He's not an animal hater.

766
00:52:43,345 --> 00:52:48,624
In fact, he's already looking after
quite a large menagerie for his boys already.

767
00:52:48,783 --> 00:52:53,232
White mice, canaries,
a couple of rabbits and a snake.

768
00:52:53,388 --> 00:52:57,131
He can certainly cope with Delilah.

769
00:53:01,196 --> 00:53:02,266
Ale you a master?

770
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:03,500
Yes.

771
00:53:03,665 --> 00:53:07,340
- Sir, I shouldn't have sat--
-Yes, you should.

772
00:53:09,237 --> 00:53:12,343
I was a new boy here myself once,
a long time ago.

773
00:53:12,507 --> 00:53:14,612
I had a myna bird, I remember...

774
00:53:14,776 --> 00:53:17,814
...which I taught to say,
"Brookfield forever."

775
00:53:17,979 --> 00:53:20,516
They took that away from me,
and they were quite right.

776
00:53:20,682 --> 00:53:22,559
Its sense of timing was peccable.

777
00:53:22,717 --> 00:53:24,060
Peccable, sir?

778
00:53:24,219 --> 00:53:25,425
Faulty.

779
00:53:25,587 --> 00:53:29,000
I should have said faulty,
it's a better word.

780
00:53:30,725 --> 00:53:33,968
Well, I'll show you the way.
It's not very far.

781
00:53:34,129 --> 00:53:36,166
Would you take Delilah?

782
00:53:36,331 --> 00:53:38,675
I can see why you love her,
she's quite delightful.

783
00:53:38,833 --> 00:53:41,837
And better let me take these.

784
00:53:42,003 --> 00:53:44,643
Absolutely blind drunk, my dear fellow.

785
00:53:44,806 --> 00:53:45,978
It was most embarrassing.

786
00:53:46,141 --> 00:53:48,417
I mean, I'm known in Naples.
and can you imagine?

787
00:53:48,576 --> 00:53:49,611
I was almost raped.

788
00:53:49,778 --> 00:53:52,884
- Oh, man, you exaggerate so.
-No, I don't.

789
00:53:53,048 --> 00:53:56,518
And I don't flatter myself
about the incident either.

790
00:53:56,685 --> 00:53:58,255
It was all rather a pity.

791
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:04,530
Until that moment, I'd found her really,
rather surprisingly civilized.

792
00:54:05,994 --> 00:54:08,736
Tiny little thing, very pretty hair.

793
00:54:10,098 --> 00:54:12,669
Why pick on me?

794
00:54:12,834 --> 00:54:15,474
An old stick in the mud.

795
00:54:16,037 --> 00:54:17,983
It's a very accurate description of you.

796
00:54:20,575 --> 00:54:22,612
Don't rub it in, Max.

797
00:54:22,777 --> 00:54:25,986
But then, musical-comedy actresses
can't be quite normal...

798
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:31,262
...with all that dressing up
and skipping around.

799
00:54:31,419 --> 00:54:33,421
But even so.

800
00:54:34,289 --> 00:54:35,825
Hello.

801
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,466
Oh, why, hello.

802
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:46,306
Medea at the Old Vic?

803
00:54:47,869 --> 00:54:49,780
No, I hadn't forgotten.

804
00:54:49,938 --> 00:54:54,546
It's just that it would be impossible
to get tickets for this Friday.

805
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:57,949
You've got them.

806
00:55:00,648 --> 00:55:04,152
223 Riverwalk, Chiswick.

807
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:07,198
Yes, yes. I've got that down.

808
00:55:10,425 --> 00:55:12,098
Oh, yes.

809
00:55:13,728 --> 00:55:17,801
Oh, I'm sure
I would enjoy meeting them very much.

810
00:55:19,901 --> 00:55:22,677
Looking forward to it enormously.

811
00:55:22,837 --> 00:55:27,684
And how nice to hear from you
out of the blue.

812
00:55:29,444 --> 00:55:30,980
Goodbye.

813
00:55:44,726 --> 00:55:48,970
I suppose a telegram at the last minute
saying I'm ill.

814
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:53,135
But, um, you didn't write
the address down.

815
00:55:53,601 --> 00:55:54,807
What 101?

816
00:55:54,969 --> 00:55:57,176
To send a telegram to, uh...

817
00:55:57,338 --> 00:55:59,443
Oh, I can't. I've forgotten it.

818
00:56:00,542 --> 00:56:06,049
223 Riverwalk, Chiswick.

819
00:56:10,652 --> 00:56:11,653
- Two?
-Two.

820
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:12,821
Two.

821
00:56:13,988 --> 00:56:20,371
--3 Riverwalk, Chiswick.

822
00:56:34,375 --> 00:56:35,615
Oh, but could--?

823
00:56:35,777 --> 00:56:39,782
Oh, but, darling, what, I ask you,
but what's going to happen to Chloe?

824
00:56:39,948 --> 00:56:43,020
I mean, it's all too devastating for words
to be left by Eloise...

825
00:56:43,184 --> 00:56:45,630
...for, of all people, Freddie Franklin-Finch.

826
00:56:45,787 --> 00:56:48,768
Freddie Franklin-Finch,
who doesn't even come up to her navel.

827
00:56:48,923 --> 00:56:49,993
- Ale you going in?
-Yes.

828
00:56:50,158 --> 00:56:52,263
Oh, don't, it's hell.

829
00:56:52,594 --> 00:56:54,699
What is poor Chloe going to do?

830
00:56:54,863 --> 00:56:57,139
You're in that wonderful play
at the Criterion...

831
00:56:57,298 --> 00:56:58,936
...where you drink in the last act.

832
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:00,704
- Actually--
-You do it beautifully.

833
00:57:00,869 --> 00:57:02,542
It made me believe every other word.

834
00:57:02,704 --> 00:57:04,615
- Where do you wear that orchid?
-Well, I--

835
00:57:04,772 --> 00:57:06,513
- Dear heart.
- Not at all.

836
00:57:06,674 --> 00:57:08,585
But Eloise and Freddie.

837
00:57:08,743 --> 00:57:11,519
I mean, you know me, darling.
I don't care what people do...

838
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,955
...provided they do it in bed,
but it's too much.

839
00:57:14,115 --> 00:57:16,391
I mean he's so small, it's impractical--

840
00:57:16,551 --> 00:57:20,397
I don't think I do know you.

841
00:57:20,588 --> 00:57:22,397
You must be mad.

842
00:57:22,557 --> 00:57:24,764
- What's your name?
-Arthur Chipping.

843
00:57:24,926 --> 00:57:27,429
That's right. You take to drink.

844
00:57:27,595 --> 00:57:29,973
I do not take to drink, madam.
Excuse me.

845
00:57:30,131 --> 00:57:32,737
Madam, I like. Madam, I adore.

846
00:57:32,901 --> 00:57:34,710
Chipping, I know.

847
00:57:34,869 --> 00:57:36,507
The guest of honour at some party...

848
00:57:36,671 --> 00:57:39,208
...I've been asked to
at Augustus John's or Tallulah's.

849
00:57:39,374 --> 00:57:42,821
Mr. Chips.
I was so scaled you wouldn't tum up.

850
00:57:43,478 --> 00:57:45,185
My guest of honour, Arthur Chipping.

851
00:57:45,346 --> 00:57:46,381
How do you do?

852
00:57:46,547 --> 00:57:48,549
Oh, it was here. I knew it was somewhere.

853
00:57:48,716 --> 00:57:51,162
Oh, but what a beautiful man, Katie.

854
00:57:51,586 --> 00:57:53,122
What's your next play, darling?

855
00:57:53,288 --> 00:57:56,235
I'm not an actor, madam.
I'm a schoolmaster.

856
00:57:56,391 --> 00:57:58,530
He could call me madam all night.

857
00:57:58,693 --> 00:58:01,333
Well, come along, children, time to go.

858
00:58:01,496 --> 00:58:03,169
- Night is young, say bye-bye.
- Bye.

859
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:09,145
- Oh, Katie, darling, absolutely wonderful.
- Thank you.

860
00:58:09,304 --> 00:58:11,750
Wear that orchid behind your ear.
you know.

861
00:58:11,906 --> 00:58:14,978
Oh, a beautiful man.
Where Katie finds them, I don't know.

862
00:58:15,143 --> 00:58:18,215
Change from that last one,
that abysmal Bill Calbury, or the one--

863
00:58:18,379 --> 00:58:21,986
Come on, Ursula.
I told Penelope we'd be there ages ago.

864
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:25,859
Bobbie, my dear, don't rush me.
Can't you see I'm running away?

865
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:27,590
I'm so glad you came.

866
00:58:27,755 --> 00:58:31,202
So am I. Very glad indeed.

867
00:58:32,026 --> 00:58:33,562
Come in.

868
00:58:34,028 --> 00:58:36,838
You won't know anybody.
but they're all mad to meet you.

869
00:58:36,998 --> 00:58:38,568
- They are?
-Mm-hm.

870
00:58:40,101 --> 00:58:44,049
Who was that lady
I just had the pleasure of meeting?

871
00:58:44,205 --> 00:58:45,240
Ursula?

872
00:58:45,406 --> 00:58:47,511
- She's just Ursula.
-Indeed?

873
00:58:47,675 --> 00:58:51,919
Very famous actress, Ursula Mossbank,
but, well, she's just Ursula.

874
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,855
She seemed just Ursula.

875
00:58:54,015 --> 00:58:57,224
Oh, this is for you.

876
00:58:58,252 --> 00:59:00,232
How very sweet.

877
00:59:00,388 --> 00:59:02,129
Dear Mr. Chips.

878
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:04,201
Up to form .

879
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,740
Very up to form.

880
00:59:10,398 --> 00:59:13,607
I didn't know who to ask,
so I just got together a few of my friends.

881
00:59:13,768 --> 00:59:15,338
I'd be delighted to meet them.

882
00:59:15,503 --> 00:59:18,609
I adore Ramsay MacDonald.
He's got such a beautiful face.

883
00:59:18,773 --> 00:59:20,548
And if you took off his moustache...

884
00:59:20,708 --> 00:59:24,087
...people would stand up in Hyde Park
to see him go by.

885
00:59:24,245 --> 00:59:26,953
- I wouldn't.
-Never mind, darling.

886
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:30,557
Hello.

887
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:38,837
- Tilly, Arthur Chipping.
-Hello. How do you do?

888
00:59:40,895 --> 00:59:43,398
Eloise, Arthur Chipping.
my guest of honour.

889
00:59:43,564 --> 00:59:44,599
How do you do?

890
00:59:44,766 --> 00:59:46,768
Yes, I know...

891
00:59:50,505 --> 00:59:52,917
Oh, hello, you remember me? Algie.

892
00:59:53,074 --> 00:59:54,849
- You're, um...?
-Chipping.

893
00:59:55,009 --> 00:59:57,250
Oh, yes, yes.
Well, come and have green tea, eh?

894
00:59:57,412 --> 00:59:59,085
Green tea. Come along, old chap.

895
00:59:59,247 --> 01:00:00,783
Now, what would you like?

896
01:00:00,948 --> 01:00:02,427
My dear, you weren't coming.

897
01:00:02,583 --> 01:00:06,292
Amiably done.
Kevin had the divine Captain Carville, oh--

898
01:00:06,454 --> 01:00:08,229
Look what you've done, you silly gill.

899
01:00:08,389 --> 01:00:10,892
You've spilt my white lady
all over your dress.

900
01:00:11,059 --> 01:00:13,039
Allow me, dear.

901
01:00:15,763 --> 01:00:16,798
Well, you must--

902
01:00:16,964 --> 01:00:20,571
Oh, you're a friend of Maynard Keynes.
and you write for that paper, Monsieur?

903
01:00:20,735 --> 01:00:22,942
- Actually, no, I--
-Oh, I swore it.

904
01:00:23,104 --> 01:00:26,483
Mind you, didn't think
I'd be back so soon.

905
01:00:28,476 --> 01:00:30,080
Johnnie, how sweet of you to come.

906
01:00:30,244 --> 01:00:32,417
Absolute hell.
all the gate-washers in the world.

907
01:00:34,615 --> 01:00:36,891
My dear, isn't it a shame
I'd never heard of you?

908
01:00:37,051 --> 01:00:40,931
You just hold my hand and I'll--
But I daren't in public.

909
01:00:41,355 --> 01:00:43,426
Go rescue your friend.
He's stuck with Tilly.

910
01:00:43,591 --> 01:00:45,400
- What friend ?
-There.

911
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:48,672
I'm so sorry.

912
01:00:49,097 --> 01:00:50,201
It's not Chips?

913
01:00:50,364 --> 01:00:51,399
Yes, poor darling.

914
01:00:51,566 --> 01:00:53,011
What?

915
01:00:53,167 --> 01:00:54,202
One moment.

916
01:00:54,368 --> 01:00:56,109
Bye-bye, darling. Thank you so much.

917
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:57,578
I mean that with all men--

918
01:00:57,738 --> 01:01:00,344
- Chips.
-Johnnie.

919
01:01:00,508 --> 01:01:02,613
Let's go over there, Longbridge.

920
01:01:02,977 --> 01:01:04,752
- Let's sit down somewhere.
- Move along.

921
01:01:06,247 --> 01:01:07,920
Move along.

922
01:01:08,082 --> 01:01:10,824
Now, dear, who in the devil
would want to see a museum?

923
01:01:10,985 --> 01:01:14,194
Oh, frankly, I never have sleep.
but you have to take your--

924
01:01:14,455 --> 01:01:17,527
- What's the matter with you?
- Oh, bless you.

925
01:01:17,692 --> 01:01:19,171
But why are you guest of honour?

926
01:01:19,327 --> 01:01:22,467
Along story, Johnnie, but look,
in Naples, I did my best for you...

927
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:25,110
...because she's nice,
and I'm doing my best for you--

928
01:01:25,266 --> 01:01:26,643
Oh, gosh.

929
01:01:26,801 --> 01:01:28,974
- You're raving, aren't you?
-Well, of course.

930
01:01:29,137 --> 01:01:32,084
An hour of this, and who wouldn't?
But there's Medea after this.

931
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:35,380
You love this minuscule creature.
and I don't altogether blame you...

932
01:01:35,543 --> 01:01:37,284
...so I'm doing my very best for you.

933
01:01:37,445 --> 01:01:39,721
Oh, I do apologize
for this nightmare of a party.

934
01:01:39,881 --> 01:01:42,020
Oh, it's not a nightmare at all.
It's splendid.

935
01:01:42,183 --> 01:01:43,457
Hello, Katie, darling.

936
01:01:44,385 --> 01:01:45,830
Haven't you got the wrong address?

937
01:01:45,987 --> 01:01:47,159
That's a good one.

938
01:01:47,321 --> 01:01:49,130
I helped furnish this house, remember?

939
01:01:49,290 --> 01:01:50,769
Yes, I do...

940
01:01:50,925 --> 01:01:54,270
...but I have a private party in it
to which you were not invited.

941
01:01:54,695 --> 01:01:57,699
- So would you please go?
-Now, Katie, old gill, really.

942
01:01:57,865 --> 01:01:59,242
Bygones and things.

943
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:02,210
Wouldn't be so unkind to an old friend
as to throw him out"?

944
01:02:02,370 --> 01:02:05,249
Did you not hear Miss Bridges
ask you to go?

945
01:02:05,406 --> 01:02:07,545
- Who are you?
-It doesn't matter who I am.

946
01:02:07,708 --> 01:02:10,951
All that matters is that Miss Bridges
wishes you to leave her house...

947
01:02:11,112 --> 01:02:12,648
...and you are therefore leaving.

948
01:02:12,813 --> 01:02:15,487
I've met you somewhere before.
I remember that voice.

949
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:18,688
Now, here are your hat and stick,
and that is the front door.

950
01:02:18,853 --> 01:02:21,265
- Do tell this idiotic man--
- Straight ahead, please.

951
01:02:21,422 --> 01:02:23,424
That voice. There's something about it.

952
01:02:23,591 --> 01:02:26,265
I don't know who you are.
but I can guess what you are.

953
01:02:26,427 --> 01:02:28,134
- You're a schoolteacher.
- Correct.

954
01:02:28,296 --> 01:02:32,073
- I'll bet you give your boys hell.
- Only the bad ones.

955
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:47,323
Now I know.

956
01:02:47,848 --> 01:02:50,988
Not that I needed to,
but now I know for sure.

957
01:02:53,221 --> 01:02:54,700
What?

958
01:03:02,797 --> 01:03:04,708
Well, If that's how you do
your best for me...

959
01:03:04,865 --> 01:03:07,812
...I'd be interested to see how
you do your worst.

960
01:03:07,969 --> 01:03:12,008
My dear old fellow, you really mustn't
leap to insane conclusions.

961
01:03:12,173 --> 01:03:14,210
It wasn't a very long leap, was it?

962
01:03:14,375 --> 01:03:16,116
Anyway, it's not insane.

963
01:03:16,277 --> 01:03:21,488
It she won't have me, and she won't.
you're much the next best thing.

964
01:03:21,649 --> 01:03:23,560
It's very sane, I think, for both of you.

965
01:03:23,718 --> 01:03:26,289
Go away, Johnnie.
You're putting a large foot in it.

966
01:03:26,454 --> 01:03:28,400
Let me handle things.

967
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:35,598
And, Johnnie, darling,
take care of the party for me.

968
01:03:42,803 --> 01:03:46,512
Walk through the world with me

969
01:03:46,674 --> 01:03:53,091
And you will see how happy life can be

970
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:57,593
How fresh and new

971
01:03:57,752 --> 01:04:01,097
When you're with me

972
01:04:01,255 --> 01:04:04,099
This is a fascinating stretch of London.
The Georgian archite--

973
01:04:04,258 --> 01:04:07,137
Don't talk. Do you mind?

974
01:04:07,295 --> 01:04:09,036
- I only observed--
-I know.

975
01:04:09,196 --> 01:04:10,937
But don't.

976
01:04:11,098 --> 01:04:17,947
Let's fly away and find another day

977
01:04:18,105 --> 01:04:21,917
To call our own

978
01:04:22,076 --> 01:04:29,051
Where we can be in love alone

979
01:04:30,017 --> 01:04:35,592
Where we can live the life
We dream of living

980
01:04:35,756 --> 01:04:41,069
Live the dream of giving all we have

981
01:04:41,228 --> 01:04:44,835
To give

982
01:04:44,999 --> 01:04:49,175
Welcoming the day

983
01:04:49,403 --> 01:04:52,509
There's one question I have to ask.

984
01:04:52,673 --> 01:04:54,619
If you must.

985
01:04:54,775 --> 01:04:58,348
When you said just now,
"Now I know for sure"...

986
01:04:58,512 --> 01:05:02,483
...what exactly was it
that you knew for sure?

987
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:04,994
That I loved you, of course.

988
01:05:07,355 --> 01:05:11,030
I can't think how you'd do.
considering you can choose--

989
01:05:11,192 --> 01:05:14,036
When you love, you don't choose.
do you?

990
01:05:15,463 --> 01:05:17,807
Look, let's be hank.

991
01:05:17,965 --> 01:05:20,878
I'm not part of your world.

992
01:05:21,035 --> 01:05:25,313
I'm afraid it's not a world
that I would wish to be part of.

993
01:05:25,473 --> 01:05:27,180
Not even for you.

994
01:05:28,376 --> 01:05:30,754
I like even for you.

995
01:05:31,412 --> 01:05:33,983
We may find each other attractive
for different reasons.

996
01:05:34,148 --> 01:05:37,152
- But how you could ever find--
-You've been into all that.

997
01:05:37,318 --> 01:05:39,798
Don't go on all night.

998
01:05:40,621 --> 01:05:43,727
It's wrong to start something
one can't finish.

999
01:05:44,058 --> 01:05:45,833
Can't you?

1000
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:48,604
Damn it, of course I can.

1001
01:05:50,998 --> 01:05:55,140
And I long to, what's more.
but we have nothing in common.

1002
01:05:55,302 --> 01:05:56,804
Nothing in the world.

1003
01:05:56,971 --> 01:06:00,817
And I refuse utterly to become
the secret lover of a well-known actress.

1004
01:06:00,975 --> 01:06:04,616
- Who said lover?
- Well, friend, I would like to be.

1005
01:06:04,779 --> 01:06:06,190
Who said friend?

1006
01:06:06,347 --> 01:06:09,351
What is there between lover and friend?

1007
01:06:09,717 --> 01:06:11,424
Husband.

1008
01:06:13,287 --> 01:06:15,198
Don't make stupid jokes, please.

1009
01:06:15,356 --> 01:06:17,393
This is serious.

1010
01:06:18,025 --> 01:06:21,165
Even if you still meant that tomorrow
when the drink has worn off...

1011
01:06:21,328 --> 01:06:26,607
...do you imagine that I would give up
my profession, my true vocation...

1012
01:06:26,767 --> 01:06:30,044
...as you know it is, to come to London
to live in your house...

1013
01:06:30,204 --> 01:06:32,684
...off your money
amongst all those awful Ursulas...

1014
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,148
...and blight young things?

1015
01:06:34,308 --> 01:06:36,015
No.

1016
01:06:36,377 --> 01:06:39,847
Dear Miss Bridges,
I'm sorry to turn down a suggestion...

1017
01:06:40,014 --> 01:06:43,552
...which most men
would give up everything for...

1018
01:06:45,019 --> 01:06:47,295
...but I'm a schoolmaster...

1019
01:06:47,822 --> 01:06:51,065
...and a schoolmaster
is all I ever want to be.

1020
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:55,238
Well, now, isn't that convenient?

1021
01:06:55,663 --> 01:06:59,543
Because all I ever want to be
is a schoolmaster's wife.

1022
01:07:01,535 --> 01:07:05,677
There's a certain tendency to tastelessness
in your jokes.

1023
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:09,151
Humour ceases to be humour.

1024
01:07:09,310 --> 01:07:12,814
I will be warm

1025
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:14,960
Hello, Mr. Chips.

1026
01:07:15,115 --> 01:07:18,062
And yours to hold

1027
01:07:18,219 --> 01:07:23,601
And we will stroll along the sand together

1028
01:07:23,757 --> 01:07:30,766
Hand in hand together for eternity

1029
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:37,540
Aren't you glad to be

1030
01:07:37,705 --> 01:07:44,122
Walking through the world

1031
01:07:44,278 --> 01:07:51,287
With me?

1032
01:07:55,689 --> 01:07:58,033
Married? Married?
I don't believe it, you're lying.

1033
01:07:58,192 --> 01:08:00,331
I'm not, really, I'm not.
It was in the Times-

1034
01:08:00,494 --> 01:08:04,738
- Well, did it say who to?
-Oh, yes, a Miss Katherine Brisket.

1035
01:08:04,899 --> 01:08:06,310
- Brisket?
-Mm.

1036
01:08:06,467 --> 01:08:07,673
But you're making it up.

1037
01:08:07,835 --> 01:08:09,314
I'm not, honestly, I'm not.

1038
01:08:09,470 --> 01:08:11,381
And can you imagine
what she must be like?

1039
01:08:11,539 --> 01:08:13,018
Anyone who'd many Ditchie?

1040
01:08:13,173 --> 01:08:17,883
It's very good of you to honour us
with your presence at our weekly assembly.

1041
01:08:18,045 --> 01:08:19,581
Are they all in, dear?

1042
01:08:19,747 --> 01:08:22,387
Mr. Chipping and Herr Staefel aren't.

1043
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:25,656
Ah, yes, Chipping is
waiting for his wife, I believe.

1044
01:08:25,819 --> 01:08:27,492
- Chipping's what?
- His wife.

1045
01:08:27,655 --> 01:08:29,794
- Surprising, isn't it?
- Flabbergasting.

1046
01:08:29,957 --> 01:08:32,597
- Who on earth?
-Who, indeed, huh?

1047
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:36,298
That's the question we've all been asking
ever since we heard the news.

1048
01:08:36,463 --> 01:08:39,910
She's had a little difficulty
choosing the right dress.

1049
01:08:40,067 --> 01:08:41,102
We're very late.

1050
01:08:41,268 --> 01:08:43,612
Well, I can't help it, Max.
Don't look so solemn.

1051
01:08:43,771 --> 01:08:46,547
- No one's ever late for assembly.
-I'm fully aware of it.

1052
01:08:46,707 --> 01:08:48,846
It's someone he met
on one of his excursions...

1053
01:08:49,009 --> 01:08:51,114
...to the ancient ruins of Pompeii.

1054
01:08:51,278 --> 01:08:54,020
Something of an ancient ruin herself.
no doubt.

1055
01:08:54,181 --> 01:08:56,991
No, not necessarily, dear.

1056
01:08:57,418 --> 01:08:59,625
Oh, God, he looked at his watch.

1057
01:08:59,787 --> 01:09:03,599
In 20 years at Brookfield, I've never once
been late for weekly assembly, Max.

1058
01:09:03,757 --> 01:09:06,328
If this is going to be
the future pattern of my life...

1059
01:09:06,493 --> 01:09:08,973
Oh, dear fellow.
I do hope you've been wise.

1060
01:09:09,129 --> 01:09:11,609
Of course I've been wise, you old idiot.

1061
01:09:11,765 --> 01:09:15,178
A pretty face is not everything, you know,
dearest old fellow.

1062
01:09:15,336 --> 01:09:18,408
There are so many questions
of temperament and suitability.

1063
01:09:18,572 --> 01:09:19,607
Suitability?

1064
01:09:19,773 --> 01:09:22,344
That's a horrible word.
It isn't even in the dictionary.

1065
01:09:22,509 --> 01:09:24,648
- It's in Webster.
-Oh, Webster.

1066
01:09:24,812 --> 01:09:26,883
Are you implying
she isn't suitable for me?

1067
01:09:27,047 --> 01:09:31,518
No. I'm simply wondering
if she's suitable as your wife.

1068
01:09:31,685 --> 01:09:33,528
Here she is.

1069
01:09:33,954 --> 01:09:35,490
Oh, I'm so sorry, darling.

1070
01:09:35,656 --> 01:09:36,896
- Is this all light?
- Yes.

1071
01:09:37,057 --> 01:09:38,900
We must hurry,
the headmaster's waiting.

1072
01:09:39,059 --> 01:09:41,232
This is Max Staefel, my closest friend.

1073
01:09:41,395 --> 01:09:43,966
Oh, Chips has told me
so much about you...

1074
01:09:44,131 --> 01:09:48,011
...but, well, I expected someone far older
and much less handsome.

1075
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:50,405
We must go.

1076
01:09:50,838 --> 01:09:54,513
An ancient ruin, did you say, my dear?

1077
01:09:54,908 --> 01:09:56,216
This isn't a joke, is it?

1078
01:09:56,377 --> 01:09:59,483
Chipping's plainly lost
all sense of proportion.

1079
01:09:59,647 --> 01:10:01,854
Some people might think he'd found it.

1080
01:10:02,016 --> 01:10:03,620
This gill is Chipping's wife?

1081
01:10:03,784 --> 01:10:06,094
We must assume so.

1082
01:10:06,253 --> 01:10:08,255
Why, do you know her?

1083
01:10:08,989 --> 01:10:10,263
Oh, do forgive us.

1084
01:10:10,424 --> 01:10:12,768
My wife had a little difficulty
choosing her dress.

1085
01:10:12,926 --> 01:10:16,669
Well, it's not my fault, it's Chips.
I put on six dresses before he approved.

1086
01:10:16,830 --> 01:10:19,572
And he approved of that one, hm?

1087
01:10:20,901 --> 01:10:22,847
I'm so terribly sorry about being late.

1088
01:10:23,003 --> 01:10:25,574
Chips tells me it's as bad
as being off your big number.

1089
01:10:25,973 --> 01:10:28,783
I don't quite understand
that allusion, Mrs. Chipping.

1090
01:10:28,942 --> 01:10:31,013
Oh, Mrs. Chipping.

1091
01:10:31,178 --> 01:10:33,351
Oh, I just love it when I'm called that.

1092
01:10:33,514 --> 01:10:35,926
But, um, you are that, yes?

1093
01:10:36,083 --> 01:10:37,653
Oh, yes, well and truly.

1094
01:10:37,818 --> 01:10:40,765
Well, unless Chips is a bigamist.
which I rather suspect.

1095
01:10:41,321 --> 01:10:44,165
How else would he have escaped
until now?

1096
01:10:45,292 --> 01:10:47,568
No, the allusion, headmaster.
was to the stage...

1097
01:10:47,728 --> 01:10:49,537
...which used to be my profession.

1098
01:10:49,697 --> 01:10:52,644
- Indeed?
- You're an actress, Mrs. Chipping?

1099
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,508
Well, not even my best friends
would call me that.

1100
01:10:55,669 --> 01:10:58,206
Ah. And what would they call you?

1101
01:10:58,372 --> 01:11:00,010
A soubrette.

1102
01:11:00,174 --> 01:11:03,451
That's the gill in musical comedies
who usually sings the big number...

1103
01:11:03,610 --> 01:11:05,419
...and then loses the man.

1104
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:08,888
In real life, they nearly always wind up
as wives of earls.

1105
01:11:09,049 --> 01:11:11,723
I nearly did, but luckily, I met Chips.

1106
01:11:13,854 --> 01:11:16,460
Regarding the derivation
of the word soubrette...

1107
01:11:16,623 --> 01:11:19,502
...there was an interesting discussion
in the Times recently--

1108
01:11:19,660 --> 01:11:22,163
Quite so, quite so.
I really think we ought to go in.

1109
01:11:22,863 --> 01:11:25,469
Urn, you don't know Lord Sutterwick,
I believe.

1110
01:11:26,366 --> 01:11:27,811
Oh, but I do, I think.

1111
01:11:27,968 --> 01:11:29,447
- I don't think so.
-But surely--

1112
01:11:29,603 --> 01:11:32,447
We must go in, dear.
the headmaster always goes in last...

1113
01:11:32,606 --> 01:11:35,143
...and the boys receive him standing
and in silence.

1114
01:11:35,309 --> 01:11:37,755
Sounds like a dream entrance.

1115
01:11:44,184 --> 01:11:46,323
The headmaster's a darling.
His wife's a bitch.

1116
01:11:46,487 --> 01:11:48,364
That's not a word we use at Brookfield.

1117
01:11:48,522 --> 01:11:49,967
You should, I think.

1118
01:11:50,124 --> 01:11:53,196
Oh, I'm so nervous
you may have to carry me.

1119
01:12:03,871 --> 01:12:05,248
Do you see what I see?

1120
01:12:05,405 --> 01:12:07,715
I simply refuse to believe what I see.

1121
01:12:07,875 --> 01:12:11,584
Oh, good, I thought for a moment
these new glasses had let me down.

1122
01:12:19,153 --> 01:12:21,030
Goodness, what a commotion.

1123
01:12:21,188 --> 01:12:24,567
How the boys seem
to appreciate a pretty face.

1124
01:12:33,066 --> 01:12:36,843
Did you intend to say anything
about the gift of the new playing fields?

1125
01:12:37,004 --> 01:12:40,645
- It seemed a good occasion.
-I must ask you not to.

1126
01:12:40,908 --> 01:12:43,616
- Why ever not?
-Because there may not be one.

1127
01:12:43,777 --> 01:12:46,087
I'll explain later. Shall we?

1128
01:13:08,902 --> 01:13:11,178
All right.
so the curtsy made you look ridiculous.

1129
01:13:11,338 --> 01:13:13,511
- I didn't say that.
-Yes, you did.

1130
01:13:13,674 --> 01:13:17,121
What the hell have you got
against this bloody hat, anyway?

1131
01:13:17,744 --> 01:13:19,951
Look around.
see what the others are wearing.

1132
01:13:20,113 --> 01:13:21,990
Stand up and keep quiet.

1133
01:13:23,317 --> 01:13:24,660
Look at that old bag.

1134
01:13:24,818 --> 01:13:27,128
- She's put the baby's pot on.
- Shh.

1135
01:13:27,721 --> 01:13:29,291
Not the baby's pot either.

1136
01:13:29,456 --> 01:13:31,163
Her own.

1137
01:13:34,094 --> 01:13:37,598
As always.
we will start with the school song.

1138
01:13:37,764 --> 01:13:43,840
In the morning of my life
I shall look to the sunrise

1139
01:13:44,004 --> 01:13:50,216
At a moment in my life
When the world is new

1140
01:13:50,377 --> 01:13:56,555
And the blessing I shall ask
ls that God will grant me

1141
01:13:56,717 --> 01:14:02,895
To be brave and strong and true

1142
01:14:03,290 --> 01:14:09,605
And to fill the world with love
My whole life through

1143
01:14:09,763 --> 01:14:12,744
And to fill the world with love

1144
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:15,881
And to fill the world with love

1145
01:14:16,036 --> 01:14:19,017
And to fill the world with love

1146
01:14:19,172 --> 01:14:23,882
My whole life through

1147
01:14:24,044 --> 01:14:28,322
In the noontime of my life
I shall look to the sunshine

1148
01:14:30,217 --> 01:14:36,463
At a moment in my life
When the sky is blue

1149
01:14:36,623 --> 01:14:42,539
And the blessing I shall ask
Will remain unchanging

1150
01:14:42,696 --> 01:14:49,045
To be brave and strong and true

1151
01:14:49,202 --> 01:14:54,880
And to fill the world with love
My whole life through

1152
01:14:55,042 --> 01:14:57,784
Did I fill the world with love?

1153
01:14:57,945 --> 01:15:00,789
Did I fill the world with love

1154
01:15:00,948 --> 01:15:03,588
Did I fill the world with love

1155
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:10,759
My whole life through?

1156
01:15:20,133 --> 01:15:22,238
-I'll take you around.
-Not now.

1157
01:15:22,402 --> 01:15:24,143
I have time before my class.

1158
01:15:24,304 --> 01:15:25,977
No, please, darling, not now.

1159
01:15:26,139 --> 01:15:30,781
You go and tell them about the interesting
derivation of the word "soubrette."

1160
01:15:32,379 --> 01:15:33,915
I'm just not feeling up to it.

1161
01:15:34,648 --> 01:15:36,491
Forgive me, darling, please forgive me.

1162
01:15:36,650 --> 01:15:37,788
Of course.

1163
01:15:38,251 --> 01:15:42,722
Just give me a few days to learn
and I won't disgrace you, I promise.

1164
01:15:42,889 --> 01:15:45,062
I'll never do that.
Never, never, never.

1165
01:15:46,026 --> 01:15:48,165
Of course you won't.

1166
01:15:55,335 --> 01:15:56,939
Congratulations, Chipping.

1167
01:15:57,104 --> 01:15:59,141
Thank you, Fenwick. How's Delilah?

1168
01:15:59,306 --> 01:16:01,786
Dreadful, I wish I could report
a snake had eaten her.

1169
01:16:01,942 --> 01:16:04,149
She's the most repulsive animal
in my menagerie.

1170
01:16:04,678 --> 01:16:07,386
I hesitate to put it
more bluntly in front of your wife.

1171
01:16:07,547 --> 01:16:10,153
What you mean, Lord Sutterwick,
is the girl's a tart.

1172
01:16:10,317 --> 01:16:11,819
I didn't say that.

1173
01:16:11,985 --> 01:16:15,228
I merely said that I happen to know
she's had numerous love affairs...

1174
01:16:15,389 --> 01:16:19,098
...with several well-known young men.
and her moral reputation in London stinks.

1175
01:16:19,259 --> 01:16:20,294
Dear me.

1176
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:22,064
Then why has she married Chipping?

1177
01:16:22,229 --> 01:16:26,200
As I heard the story, Calbury's the one
she's determined to get to the altar.

1178
01:16:26,366 --> 01:16:28,539
This marriage
with a figure like Chipping...

1179
01:16:28,702 --> 01:16:31,740
...is her last attempt
to bring Bill Calbury to heel.

1180
01:16:31,905 --> 01:16:35,512
That's quite beside the point, of course.
My own point is quite simple.

1181
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:40,317
As Mrs. Chipping, this person will be.
until she sees fit to leave her husband...

1182
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,482
...in charge of my son's welfare.

1183
01:16:42,649 --> 01:16:44,526
And that, headmaster, I won't have.

1184
01:16:44,684 --> 01:16:46,857
That I won't buy at any price.

1185
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:51,332
Chipping either loses his house
or you don't get those playing fields.

1186
01:16:51,491 --> 01:16:53,198
And that's quite that.

1187
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:55,931
Then that is your ultimatum,
Lord Sutterwick?

1188
01:16:56,096 --> 01:16:58,633
Ultimatum is hardly a word
I would have chosen myself.

1189
01:16:58,799 --> 01:17:01,803
Indeed, then what word
would you have chosen yourself?

1190
01:17:02,803 --> 01:17:04,612
Excuse me.

1191
01:17:08,809 --> 01:17:10,447
Chipping?

1192
01:17:26,359 --> 01:17:28,270
Katherine!

1193
01:17:41,942 --> 01:17:44,252
Katherine!

1194
01:17:47,881 --> 01:17:49,861
Caesar, heel, Heel.

1195
01:17:52,452 --> 01:17:56,161
Katherine! Katherine!

1196
01:18:08,502 --> 01:18:10,504
My dear fellow.

1197
01:18:11,304 --> 01:18:13,477
My dear old fellow.

1198
01:18:19,279 --> 01:18:21,850
Katherine!

1199
01:18:24,451 --> 01:18:29,161
- My dear old fellow, I must ask--
-That's a bloody silly word, suitability.

1200
01:18:29,322 --> 01:18:30,995
- I didn't invent it.
-How do I know?

1201
01:18:31,158 --> 01:18:33,297
It's in Webster.

1202
01:18:33,627 --> 01:18:36,130
Well, I'm not gonna let it happen, Max.

1203
01:18:43,803 --> 01:18:47,341
Apollo has willed it.

1204
01:21:48,814 --> 01:21:54,765
Today is mine
What shall I do with it?

1205
01:21:54,921 --> 01:21:59,495
Throw it away
That's what I do with it

1206
01:21:59,659 --> 01:22:06,167
Nine times out of 10

1207
01:22:07,099 --> 01:22:09,875
The sun will shine

1208
01:22:10,036 --> 01:22:12,448
Am I a friend of it?

1209
01:22:12,605 --> 01:22:17,111
You wouldn't say I was a friend of it

1210
01:22:17,276 --> 01:22:23,784
Nine times out of 10

1211
01:22:24,517 --> 01:22:27,123
The day is fine

1212
01:22:27,286 --> 01:22:29,823
What will I see in it?

1213
01:22:29,989 --> 01:22:34,665
Not very much
That's what I see in it

1214
01:22:34,827 --> 01:22:41,335
Nine times out of 10

1215
01:22:46,539 --> 01:22:50,009
What shall I do

1216
01:22:50,176 --> 01:22:56,684
With today?

1217
01:23:18,638 --> 01:23:21,710
Captain Calbury, could you tell me
where I could find Katherine?

1218
01:23:21,874 --> 01:23:23,353
Perhaps you don't remember me...

1219
01:23:23,509 --> 01:23:26,388
...but we once had the pleasure
of meeting at a party of hers.

1220
01:23:26,545 --> 01:23:29,924
- Please, tell me. Please, where is she now?
- Troops, forward march.

1221
01:23:30,082 --> 01:23:32,084
Try Ursula.

1222
01:23:32,585 --> 01:23:33,689
I'll get it, my pet.

1223
01:23:33,853 --> 01:23:37,460
Who is making that dreadful noise?

1224
01:23:37,623 --> 01:23:41,196
Darling, how divine of you to come.

1225
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:43,135
Party would have been hell
without you.

1226
01:23:43,295 --> 01:23:46,071
Not that it isn't hell.
even with you, but you mustn't mind.

1227
01:23:46,232 --> 01:23:49,770
- Still taking to drink in that third act?
-No, in the second act now.

1228
01:23:49,935 --> 01:23:51,471
Yes, that would be much better.

1229
01:23:51,637 --> 01:23:53,548
Glass of bubbly for you, I think.

1230
01:23:53,706 --> 01:23:56,118
Come along, darling.

1231
01:23:56,509 --> 01:23:59,422
No, no, darling.
urgent business to attend to.

1232
01:23:59,578 --> 01:24:03,025
We're playing the acting game.
which I know you absolutely adore, darling.

1233
01:24:03,182 --> 01:24:06,652
And I'm doing "the part is greater
than the whole" in that loom in there.

1234
01:24:06,819 --> 01:24:10,858
And I think I've found a way of doing it
so they can guess it quite quickly.

1235
01:24:11,023 --> 01:24:12,730
- Is my wife here?
-Wife?

1236
01:24:12,892 --> 01:24:15,463
- Which wile, darling?
- She was called Katherine Bridges.

1237
01:24:15,628 --> 01:24:17,164
Katie? Of course she's here.

1238
01:24:17,329 --> 01:24:18,740
- Did you say "wife"?
-Yes.

1239
01:24:18,898 --> 01:24:20,900
- But that would make you her husband.
-Yes.

1240
01:24:21,067 --> 01:24:24,537
Then she's not here, darling.
she's nowhere near the place.

1241
01:24:25,037 --> 01:24:27,108
That's what I was told to say
if you came in.

1242
01:24:27,273 --> 01:24:29,753
She's in the kitchen, darling.
making scrambled eggs.

1243
01:24:29,909 --> 01:24:32,014
- There's the kitchen.
- Ursula, you're on.

1244
01:24:32,178 --> 01:24:33,714
What was my phrase?

1245
01:24:33,879 --> 01:24:36,120
"The part is greater than the whole."

1246
01:24:36,282 --> 01:24:37,920
Oh, yes.

1247
01:24:38,084 --> 01:24:39,119
I can do that.

1248
01:24:39,285 --> 01:24:41,492
Come along, darling.

1249
01:24:57,870 --> 01:25:00,578
Too early. Whoever you are.
you'll have to wait your tum.

1250
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:02,981
I don't intend to.

1251
01:25:13,586 --> 01:25:16,499
You would catch me scrambling eggs.

1252
01:25:16,655 --> 01:25:18,328
It's no way to play this scene.

1253
01:25:18,491 --> 01:25:21,836
I do not understand
what you mean by that.

1254
01:25:21,994 --> 01:25:26,841
I've only come to tell you that I love you.
that I cannot live without you.

1255
01:25:26,999 --> 01:25:30,970
Your grammar is too perfect,
and your prose style too impeccable.

1256
01:25:31,137 --> 01:25:33,549
You can't qualify superlatives.

1257
01:25:33,706 --> 01:25:36,585
- Can't you?
-Well, you can, if you want to.

1258
01:25:36,742 --> 01:25:38,983
You can do anything if you want to.

1259
01:25:39,145 --> 01:25:44,219
You'll still remain, for me, the only person
in the world that I've ever loved...

1260
01:25:44,383 --> 01:25:46,420
...or ever will love.

1261
01:25:46,819 --> 01:25:49,060
Why did you run away?

1262
01:25:49,522 --> 01:25:52,366
I said it all outside that assembly hall.

1263
01:25:52,525 --> 01:25:54,971
I told you then
I wouldn't ever disgrace you.

1264
01:25:55,127 --> 01:25:57,300
Ever, ever, ever .

1265
01:25:57,863 --> 01:26:01,970
That might just, but only just, explain
why some gills in your position...

1266
01:26:02,134 --> 01:26:06,640
...might have deserted their duty
through sheer, paralysing, bloody funk.

1267
01:26:06,806 --> 01:26:08,410
It didn't explain why you did.

1268
01:26:08,874 --> 01:26:10,876
Well, I did desert it.

1269
01:26:11,043 --> 01:26:12,386
- Isn't that proof enough?
-No.

1270
01:26:12,545 --> 01:26:15,253
- I think those eggs are burning.
-Then let them.

1271
01:26:15,548 --> 01:26:17,425
Mr. Chips.

1272
01:26:17,950 --> 01:26:19,861
I love you very much.

1273
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:23,767
- You know that, don't you?
-Yes.

1274
01:26:23,923 --> 01:26:25,402
You think I ran away from you...

1275
01:26:25,558 --> 01:26:28,004
...because of sheer, paralysing funk?
-Yes.

1276
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:30,436
Don't think it might have been
because I love you?

1277
01:26:30,596 --> 01:26:32,075
Yes, but it was still funk.

1278
01:26:34,667 --> 01:26:36,943
- Chips, you don't know--
-Oh, yes, I do know.

1279
01:26:37,102 --> 01:26:40,777
I know all about Sutterwick, his threats
to tell the governors about your past.

1280
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:43,477
I know all about your unsuitability--
Horrible word.

1281
01:26:43,642 --> 01:26:47,055
Both our unsuitabilities--
The plural is even worse.

1282
01:26:47,546 --> 01:26:50,220
But how you'd ever imagine
that a word like suitability--

1283
01:26:50,382 --> 01:26:53,454
Which is only in Webster, mind you,
not in the Oxford, or is it?

1284
01:26:53,819 --> 01:26:59,269
--Could ever prevail over a word like love.
which is in all the dictionaries.

1285
01:26:59,425 --> 01:27:01,405
There's no earthly reason to cry.
you know.

1286
01:27:02,294 --> 01:27:04,205
Of course there isn't.

1287
01:27:07,199 --> 01:27:09,770
You must have been all over the place
looking for me.

1288
01:27:10,135 --> 01:27:11,614
Here and there.

1289
01:27:11,770 --> 01:27:14,876
I demanded and took a fortnight's leave.

1290
01:27:16,442 --> 01:27:21,255
You, who never cut a class
in your whole life...

1291
01:27:21,413 --> 01:27:23,256
...took off a fortnight?

1292
01:27:24,016 --> 01:27:26,257
I'd have taken a lifetime.

1293
01:27:35,527 --> 01:27:37,700
Oh, Chips.

1294
01:27:38,831 --> 01:27:41,778
You'll lose everything you hold dear.

1295
01:27:41,934 --> 01:27:45,609
Everything I hold dear, I'm holding now.

1296
01:27:46,572 --> 01:27:50,452
Anyway, I mean to fight
and beat Sutterwick.

1297
01:27:50,609 --> 01:27:54,318
Don't tell me that dreadful man is here
or I'll have to get the police.

1298
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,016
- How are the eggs?
- Scrambled.

1299
01:27:56,181 --> 01:27:58,661
So I see.
The part is greater than the whole.

1300
01:27:58,817 --> 01:28:01,024
With me acting.
wouldn't you think they'd guess?

1301
01:28:01,186 --> 01:28:03,996
All they kept saying was
"The Brothers Karamazov."

1302
01:28:04,156 --> 01:28:06,329
I'll get Freddie Franklin-Finch to fix these.

1303
01:28:06,492 --> 01:28:08,733
He adores doing eggs for some reason.

1304
01:28:08,894 --> 01:28:10,373
He's very Freudian, our Freddie.

1305
01:28:10,529 --> 01:28:13,032
Ursula, you know Lord Sutterwick?

1306
01:28:13,198 --> 01:28:15,200
That's light, darling, the police.

1307
01:28:15,367 --> 01:28:18,075
There's a rather divine sergeant
at Vine Street.

1308
01:28:18,237 --> 01:28:19,409
I'll get him.

1309
01:28:19,571 --> 01:28:21,812
How that Sutterwick
has the gall to come here...

1310
01:28:21,974 --> 01:28:25,353
...when I'd thrown him out
bag and baggage last July.

1311
01:28:25,511 --> 01:28:27,047
I kept a little of the baggage...

1312
01:28:27,212 --> 01:28:29,920
...just a few ratty pieces of sable
and the odd chandelier.

1313
01:28:30,082 --> 01:28:32,460
Oh, but so mean.
with all those millions.

1314
01:28:32,618 --> 01:28:35,895
Darling, connect me
with Vine Street Police Station.

1315
01:28:36,055 --> 01:28:37,090
Sergeant Higgins.

1316
01:28:37,256 --> 01:28:40,499
Ursula, Lord Sutterwick is not here.
I only asked you if you knew him.

1317
01:28:40,659 --> 01:28:41,763
Forget it, darling.

1318
01:28:41,927 --> 01:28:43,304
Know Soapy Sutterwick?

1319
01:28:43,462 --> 01:28:46,136
I did, like the back of my hand.
only rather better...

1320
01:28:46,298 --> 01:28:48,869
...because I never have got to know
the back of my hand.

1321
01:28:49,034 --> 01:28:51,275
Why are you looking at me like that?

1322
01:28:51,437 --> 01:28:54,782
Was I?
Oh, it must have been a little thought I had.

1323
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:57,853
- Ursula, we must go.
-We? You're not taking him?

1324
01:28:58,010 --> 01:29:00,684
Of course, you two are married
or something, aren't you?

1325
01:29:00,846 --> 01:29:03,759
Married, madam.
and quite definitely not something.

1326
01:29:03,916 --> 01:29:05,987
I adore this man.

1327
01:29:06,151 --> 01:29:08,961
When you've finished with him, Katie.
lend him to me.

1328
01:29:09,121 --> 01:29:10,259
Bye-bye, my darlings.

1329
01:29:10,422 --> 01:29:14,996
See you tomorrow or next year.
or in heaven or somewhere.

1330
01:29:15,961 --> 01:29:18,532
In heaven, certainly.

1331
01:29:30,576 --> 01:29:33,113
What a lot of flowers.

1332
01:29:35,347 --> 01:29:38,021
What a lot of sunshine.

1333
01:29:38,717 --> 01:29:43,132
What a lot of beauty
In the world today

1334
01:29:45,491 --> 01:29:48,529
What a world of colour

1335
01:29:48,694 --> 01:29:51,675
Just beyond my window

1336
01:29:52,164 --> 01:29:54,838
Flowers every color

1337
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,777
Of the rainbow

1338
01:30:02,574 --> 01:30:06,488
Red roses, orange marigolds

1339
01:30:06,645 --> 01:30:09,626
Yellow buttercups, green leaves

1340
01:30:09,782 --> 01:30:14,390
Blue cornflowers, indigo lilacs

1341
01:30:14,553 --> 01:30:19,400
And violets, violets

1342
01:30:22,928 --> 01:30:28,935
My happy eye perceives

1343
01:30:47,352 --> 01:30:50,856
And among the people

1344
01:30:51,023 --> 01:30:55,563
There are two who'll never be apart

1345
01:30:55,828 --> 01:30:59,071
What a lot of happiness of heart

1346
01:30:59,231 --> 01:31:02,735
Is ours

1347
01:31:04,803 --> 01:31:09,218
What a lot of flowers

1348
01:31:17,516 --> 01:31:22,488
What a lot of lovely

1349
01:31:23,088 --> 01:31:28,265
Pretty flowers

1350
01:31:31,864 --> 01:31:33,844
Your Caesar.

1351
01:31:34,967 --> 01:31:37,379
Sutterwick, would you begin?

1352
01:31:49,681 --> 01:31:51,388
Nervous?

1353
01:31:51,717 --> 01:31:52,855
Not a bit.

1354
01:31:53,018 --> 01:31:54,793
Nor I.

1355
01:31:54,953 --> 01:31:58,059
I usually am on Parents' Day.

1356
01:31:58,223 --> 01:31:59,930
Good morning.

1357
01:32:00,092 --> 01:32:02,504
- Oh, Mr. Dickinson-Brown.
-Dickinson-Brown .

1358
01:32:02,661 --> 01:32:05,107
I hear you build
the most marvellous model aeroplanes.

1359
01:32:05,264 --> 01:32:07,744
You must let me see them sometime.
I simply love them.

1360
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:10,107
I'd be frightfully pleased to,
Mrs. Chipping.

1361
01:32:10,269 --> 01:32:12,749
- Anytime.
-Well, how about after prep tomorrow?

1362
01:32:12,905 --> 01:32:14,680
Thank you.

1363
01:32:15,541 --> 01:32:17,020
You shouldn't call them mister.

1364
01:32:17,176 --> 01:32:20,783
Oh, the older boys love it.
It makes them feel grown up.

1365
01:32:22,281 --> 01:32:24,386
Hello, Freddie. Better news from home?

1366
01:32:24,550 --> 01:32:26,393
Yes, she's much better, thank you.

1367
01:32:26,552 --> 01:32:27,758
- Good.
- Sir.

1368
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:29,866
And you shouldn't have called him
Freddie.

1369
01:32:30,022 --> 01:32:34,493
Well, nothing on earth is going to get me
to call him Robinson Minimus.

1370
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:38,107
What an idiotic thing to call a little boy.

1371
01:32:39,798 --> 01:32:43,405
Oh, worship the king

1372
01:32:43,569 --> 01:32:47,608
All glorious above

1373
01:32:47,773 --> 01:32:51,448
Oh, gratefully sing

1374
01:32:51,610 --> 01:32:55,080
His power and his love

1375
01:32:55,781 --> 01:32:59,456
Our shield and defender

1376
01:32:59,618 --> 01:33:03,623
The Ancient of Days

1377
01:33:03,789 --> 01:33:07,532
Pavilioned in splendour

1378
01:33:07,693 --> 01:33:12,164
And girded with praise

1379
01:33:20,205 --> 01:33:21,582
Yes.

1380
01:33:30,849 --> 01:33:34,820
Sutterwick, this must be a nervous
moment for you, but I shouldn't worry.

1381
01:33:34,987 --> 01:33:37,467
Your boy is a sound little player
off his back foot.

1382
01:33:37,623 --> 01:33:38,863
I was rather disappointed.

1383
01:33:39,024 --> 01:33:41,664
- My son tells me that his orders are--
-Lord Sutterwick.

1384
01:33:41,827 --> 01:33:43,932
Could I have a word with you?
Excuse me.

1385
01:33:44,096 --> 01:33:45,837
Would you mind, Baxter?

1386
01:33:47,766 --> 01:33:50,406
- Mr. Chipping.
-You will not win this battle.

1387
01:33:50,569 --> 01:33:53,413
- I've no idea to what you refer.
-Don't play it that way.

1388
01:33:53,572 --> 01:33:57,452
Excuse me, that is an expression
I've lately picked up from my wife.

1389
01:33:57,609 --> 01:34:00,715
It means you are playing theatre
instead of speaking the truth.

1390
01:34:00,879 --> 01:34:04,793
You are a businessman, and businessmen
are usually described as blunt.

1391
01:34:04,950 --> 01:34:07,157
If you won't be blunt, then I shall be.

1392
01:34:07,319 --> 01:34:10,163
You disapprove of me.
and you disapprove of my wife.

1393
01:34:10,322 --> 01:34:13,394
You are blackmailing the headmaster
into depriving me of my house.

1394
01:34:13,558 --> 01:34:15,970
Blackmailing is not a word
I am accustomed to hear.

1395
01:34:16,128 --> 01:34:17,402
I am surprised.

1396
01:34:17,562 --> 01:34:21,100
It is a word that is in all the dictionaries
and describes an activity...

1397
01:34:21,266 --> 01:34:24,907
...that is also known in the criminal code
as getting money with menaces.

1398
01:34:25,070 --> 01:34:27,482
What money am I getting, dear Mr. Chipping...

1399
01:34:27,639 --> 01:34:28,913
...and what are my menaces?

1400
01:34:29,074 --> 01:34:32,612
Your menaces are to reveal
my Wire's rather troubled past.

1401
01:34:32,778 --> 01:34:34,382
Troubled is good.

1402
01:34:34,813 --> 01:34:38,522
Troubled, indeed, is good.
It is a good word.

1403
01:34:38,684 --> 01:34:42,393
I could have chosen other words.
but I will stick to troubled.

1404
01:34:42,554 --> 01:34:45,865
To reveal my Wire's troubled past
to the governors of this school.

1405
01:34:46,024 --> 01:34:49,403
The money you will get is the money
you will withhold from this school...

1406
01:34:49,561 --> 01:34:52,041
...unless I am sacked from my house,
is that blunt?

1407
01:34:52,197 --> 01:34:54,473
No reason why I should stand here
and be insulted.

1408
01:34:54,633 --> 01:34:57,307
Except that you are standing here
and are being insulted.

1409
01:34:57,469 --> 01:34:58,573
Correct me if I'm wrong.

1410
01:35:00,205 --> 01:35:01,946
Why do you fight?

1411
01:35:02,107 --> 01:35:04,018
It puzzles me.

1412
01:35:04,176 --> 01:35:05,712
You can't possibly win.

1413
01:35:06,178 --> 01:35:07,748
In fact, you have already lost.

1414
01:35:07,913 --> 01:35:09,085
No, sir.

1415
01:35:09,247 --> 01:35:11,227
I've demanded a meeting
of the governors...

1416
01:35:11,383 --> 01:35:14,296
...and I intend to put my case to them
with all the facts.

1417
01:35:14,453 --> 01:35:16,990
I wouldn't say anything
against you behind your back...

1418
01:35:17,155 --> 01:35:19,135
...so I trust you will attend the meeting.

1419
01:35:19,291 --> 01:35:20,770
Very happily-

1420
01:35:37,909 --> 01:35:42,119
Darling, all.
It's absolutely divine to be here.

1421
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:45,853
Katie, Katie, darling.

1422
01:35:46,017 --> 01:35:47,928
Oh, my God, it couldn't be.

1423
01:35:48,086 --> 01:35:49,929
Oh, I'm so grateful to you for coming.

1424
01:35:50,088 --> 01:35:53,126
Oh, darling, it's divine of you to ask me.

1425
01:35:53,291 --> 01:35:56,670
Parents' Day, my dear.
what could be more riveting?

1426
01:35:56,828 --> 01:35:57,863
Yes.

1427
01:35:58,029 --> 01:36:01,875
And there are the boys.
I hope there are lots more.

1428
01:36:02,501 --> 01:36:04,913
Where's, uh, Soapy?

1429
01:36:05,070 --> 01:36:06,549
He's talking to Chips, I think.

1430
01:36:10,776 --> 01:36:14,223
Well, I never thought
I'd hate myself in the morning.

1431
01:36:14,379 --> 01:36:15,585
All I could find, darling.

1432
01:36:15,747 --> 01:36:18,956
At least three years old.
must make me look like Queen Victoria.

1433
01:36:19,117 --> 01:36:21,222
Take me up, darling.

1434
01:36:21,753 --> 01:36:24,233
Aren't we lucky with the day?

1435
01:36:24,856 --> 01:36:26,494
So far.

1436
01:36:26,658 --> 01:36:28,137
Oh, headmaster.

1437
01:36:28,293 --> 01:36:30,534
You might like to meet
a close friend of mine...

1438
01:36:30,695 --> 01:36:33,039
...a very famous actress,
Miss Ursula Mossbank.

1439
01:36:33,198 --> 01:36:37,476
Darling headmaster.
how simply divine to meet you.

1440
01:36:37,636 --> 01:36:38,671
How do you do?

1441
01:36:38,837 --> 01:36:41,147
- Would you excuse me?
- Yes, certainly, darling.

1442
01:36:41,306 --> 01:36:45,686
How gorgeous you look
in that divine white silk stole.

1443
01:36:45,844 --> 01:36:47,687
It's far chicer than mine, darling.

1444
01:36:51,116 --> 01:36:53,562
Can you get lid of her?

1445
01:36:53,718 --> 01:36:55,823
I don't quite understand.

1446
01:36:57,289 --> 01:37:00,099
Heavens, she's wearing that stole.

1447
01:37:00,592 --> 01:37:03,163
Look, you're a woman of the world...

1448
01:37:03,328 --> 01:37:07,799
...and once, a long time ago.
mind you, I was...

1449
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:12,114
Well, you know the situation, I'm sure.

1450
01:37:12,270 --> 01:37:13,715
Please.

1451
01:37:13,872 --> 01:37:17,649
Please, because if my wife sees her
with me, I'm lost.

1452
01:37:18,477 --> 01:37:21,390
Ursula has no tact at all.

1453
01:37:22,481 --> 01:37:25,462
Well, I'll do my best for you,
Lord Sutterwick.

1454
01:37:27,152 --> 01:37:28,859
Only for you.

1455
01:37:29,187 --> 01:37:32,293
Oh, but I adore English public schools.

1456
01:37:32,457 --> 01:37:36,667
I simply worship them all,
even that idiotic Westchester.

1457
01:37:36,828 --> 01:37:38,364
You can't ask a boy out to tea...

1458
01:37:38,530 --> 01:37:42,273
...without everyone
asking the most extraordinary questions.

1459
01:37:42,434 --> 01:37:46,211
Ursula, darling, you must see the bell tower.
And here's your guide.

1460
01:37:46,371 --> 01:37:47,873
A bell towel?

1461
01:37:48,306 --> 01:37:51,810
Oh, yes, of course, the bell towel.

1462
01:37:53,378 --> 01:37:55,483
Oh, headmaster, darling.

1463
01:37:55,647 --> 01:37:57,388
It's been wonderful.

1464
01:37:57,883 --> 01:38:00,295
You must come
to one of my little parties sometime.

1465
01:38:00,452 --> 01:38:02,932
Very informal.
Just come as you are, whatever that is.

1466
01:38:03,088 --> 01:38:04,692
Yes, I should be delighted.

1467
01:38:04,856 --> 01:38:07,735
And bring your dear wife,
if she is your dear wife.

1468
01:38:07,893 --> 01:38:11,033
Bring her anyway, darling. Goodbye.

1469
01:38:11,196 --> 01:38:13,437
Goodbye, all.

1470
01:38:13,865 --> 01:38:16,744
I hope
you like early English perpendicular.

1471
01:38:16,902 --> 01:38:21,976
Darling, I level
in early English perpendicular.

1472
01:38:27,646 --> 01:38:32,618
You know.
it's the most extraordinary thing.

1473
01:38:33,418 --> 01:38:35,329
All I did today was simply stand up...

1474
01:38:35,487 --> 01:38:39,867
...to that dreadful bounder Sutterwick,
and now he's completely caved in.

1475
01:38:40,025 --> 01:38:41,629
Completely.

1476
01:38:42,427 --> 01:38:44,998
- Has he, dear?
-But completely.

1477
01:38:45,330 --> 01:38:48,004
He's called off the governors' meeting.

1478
01:38:49,467 --> 01:38:51,708
- Has he?
-Mm.

1479
01:38:55,273 --> 01:38:59,244
Rather a triumph for me, on the whole.

1480
01:39:01,146 --> 01:39:02,648
Yes.

1481
01:39:03,248 --> 01:39:06,559
There's a lesson in it all somewhere.
I suppose.

1482
01:39:06,718 --> 01:39:08,254
Yes.

1483
01:39:09,554 --> 01:39:12,000
If only I knew what it was.

1484
01:39:17,462 --> 01:39:19,237
Oh, God.

1485
01:39:21,166 --> 01:39:23,077
You're so beautiful.

1486
01:39:26,204 --> 01:39:27,239
So are you.

1487
01:39:27,405 --> 01:39:28,884
Don't be absurd.

1488
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,042
Not being absurd.

1489
01:39:31,443 --> 01:39:33,218
Being accurate.

1490
01:39:43,688 --> 01:39:46,259
Will we love each other like this forever?

1491
01:39:46,625 --> 01:39:49,834
And among the people

1492
01:39:50,195 --> 01:39:51,936
Can you see any reason why not?

1493
01:39:52,263 --> 01:39:57,144
There are two who'll never be apart

1494
01:39:57,302 --> 01:40:04,220
What a lot of happiness of heart is ours

1495
01:40:09,447 --> 01:40:14,453
What a lot of flowers

1496
01:40:15,453 --> 01:40:20,061
What a lot of lovely

1497
01:40:20,592 --> 01:40:26,133
Pretty flowers

1498
01:40:32,604 --> 01:40:34,106
- Douglas.
- Sir.

1499
01:40:34,272 --> 01:40:36,377
- Duncan.
- Sir.

1500
01:40:40,045 --> 01:40:41,422
- Dunson.
- Sir.

1501
01:40:41,579 --> 01:40:42,649
- Edgeworth .
- Sir.

1502
01:40:42,814 --> 01:40:45,693
That's Dickinson-Brown.
His fighter squadron's based at Dover.

1503
01:40:45,850 --> 01:40:49,423
- He always shoots us up when he's flying.
-Quiet, please.

1504
01:40:51,856 --> 01:40:53,392
- Elliot.
- Sir.

1505
01:40:53,558 --> 01:40:54,764
- Finch.
- Sir.

1506
01:40:54,926 --> 01:40:56,064
- Fisher.
- Sir.

1507
01:40:56,227 --> 01:40:57,433
- Forbes.
- Sir.

1508
01:40:57,595 --> 01:40:59,336
- Foster.
- Sir.

1509
01:40:59,497 --> 01:41:00,874
- Gaye.
- Sir.

1510
01:41:01,032 --> 01:41:02,705
- Gibbs.
- Sir.

1511
01:41:02,867 --> 01:41:04,642
- Glanville.
- Sir.

1512
01:41:16,481 --> 01:41:18,620
It's Dickinson-Brown again.
It's disgraceful.

1513
01:41:18,783 --> 01:41:19,921
He'll scale the boys.

1514
01:41:20,085 --> 01:41:22,725
I'm afraid they may have worse things
to scare them soon.

1515
01:41:22,887 --> 01:41:23,922
Do you think so, dear?

1516
01:41:24,089 --> 01:41:27,332
I prefer to believe in Mr. Chamberlain
and peace in our time.

1517
01:41:27,492 --> 01:41:29,472
- I wish I did.
-Really?

1518
01:41:29,627 --> 01:41:33,598
Steven, how many times have I told you?
I do beg your pardon.

1519
01:41:33,765 --> 01:41:35,802
Come on, Kennedy, it's the last of them.

1520
01:41:35,967 --> 01:41:38,914
- It's a lovely flower.
- Thank you, dear.

1521
01:41:42,741 --> 01:41:43,776
Oh, thank you, David.

1522
01:41:43,942 --> 01:41:45,478
It's a pleasure, Katherine.

1523
01:41:45,643 --> 01:41:47,816
Mrs. Chipping, David.
You know it's the rule.

1524
01:41:47,979 --> 01:41:50,391
In a week's time, I'll have left Brookfield.

1525
01:41:50,548 --> 01:41:52,824
The next time we meet.
there won't be any rules.

1526
01:41:52,984 --> 01:41:55,464
When you're in the Horse Guards,
there'll be some.

1527
01:41:55,620 --> 01:41:57,065
Allow me.

1528
01:41:59,758 --> 01:42:01,396
See you at lunch.

1529
01:42:05,864 --> 01:42:08,435
Oh, God, you're so beautiful.

1530
01:42:09,801 --> 01:42:11,109
- Chilton.
- Sir.

1531
01:42:11,269 --> 01:42:12,304
- Fan.
- Sir.

1532
01:42:12,470 --> 01:42:13,642
- Faye.
- Sir.

1533
01:42:13,805 --> 01:42:16,081
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1534
01:42:16,641 --> 01:42:20,384
I had to come in person and tell you
how very sorry I was to hear your news.

1535
01:42:20,545 --> 01:42:23,526
How very kind of you, Katherine.

1536
01:42:23,681 --> 01:42:28,152
Yes, leaving here after 20 years
is going to be rather a wrench, I admit.

1537
01:42:28,319 --> 01:42:31,129
But of course, it has to be.

1538
01:42:31,289 --> 01:42:33,235
Anno Domini.

1539
01:42:34,926 --> 01:42:38,135
It doesn't seem fair, does it,
that as we get older...

1540
01:42:38,296 --> 01:42:40,799
...they stay the same age.

1541
01:42:40,965 --> 01:42:42,569
No, it doesn't.

1542
01:42:42,734 --> 01:42:44,372
Oh, well.

1543
01:42:45,804 --> 01:42:49,217
I realise that delicacy
may prevent you asking this...

1544
01:42:49,374 --> 01:42:53,823
...but I have recommended your husband
to the governor as my successor.

1545
01:42:53,978 --> 01:42:55,958
Not that that may count for much.

1546
01:42:56,114 --> 01:42:57,855
Oh, you know it will.

1547
01:42:58,016 --> 01:42:59,051
I'm terribly grateful.

1548
01:42:59,217 --> 01:43:01,026
Well, there's no need.

1549
01:43:01,186 --> 01:43:02,221
- Miller.
- Sir.

1550
01:43:02,387 --> 01:43:05,027
I recommended the man
that I thought would be the best.

1551
01:43:05,590 --> 01:43:09,629
I haven't always thought that.
I suppose, but, uh...

1552
01:43:09,794 --> 01:43:11,740
How long have you been married?

1553
01:43:11,896 --> 01:43:14,672
- It's our 15th anniversary today.
-Ah.

1554
01:43:14,833 --> 01:43:16,244
- Vincent.
- Sir.

1555
01:43:16,401 --> 01:43:17,436
- Wedlake.
- Sir.

1556
01:43:17,602 --> 01:43:18,637
- Wenham.
- Sir.

1557
01:43:18,803 --> 01:43:19,941
- Whitely.
- Sir.

1558
01:43:20,104 --> 01:43:21,344
- William.
- Sir.

1559
01:43:21,506 --> 01:43:22,712
- Wordsley.
- Sir.

1560
01:43:22,874 --> 01:43:24,114
- Wright.
- Sir.

1561
01:43:24,275 --> 01:43:26,312
- Yates.
- Sir.

1562
01:43:26,477 --> 01:43:28,013
Thank you.

1563
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:31,217
Thank you for my anniversary present.

1564
01:43:31,382 --> 01:43:34,727
Your own you'll find on the table
in front of you at lunch.

1565
01:43:34,886 --> 01:43:36,797
Meaning you'd totally forgotten.

1566
01:43:37,422 --> 01:43:39,527
No wonder the boys call you Ditchie.

1567
01:43:39,691 --> 01:43:43,332
Short for "ditchwater, dull as."

1568
01:43:43,895 --> 01:43:46,432
I don't think they do any longer.

1569
01:43:46,598 --> 01:43:48,339
- What do they call you?
- I don't know.

1570
01:43:48,499 --> 01:43:50,740
Chips, I think. Chips.

1571
01:43:50,902 --> 01:43:54,349
- Ah, now, that's much better.
- Oh, no, Max, they still don't like me.

1572
01:43:54,505 --> 01:43:58,612
I don't expect them to any longer.
unfeeling little monsters.

1573
01:43:58,776 --> 01:44:00,881
Let them unfeel. Who cares?

1574
01:44:01,045 --> 01:44:05,152
In the last 35 years.
I've become just as unfeeling as they are.

1575
01:44:05,650 --> 01:44:07,425
Hey, boy-

1576
01:44:08,953 --> 01:44:10,398
Where's the file?

1577
01:44:10,555 --> 01:44:12,899
- I'm late for class, sir.
- Why?

1578
01:44:13,057 --> 01:44:15,094
Sir, I was down at the swimming pool, sir...

1579
01:44:15,260 --> 01:44:18,639
...practicing my diving and my watch
stopped, because it got water in it.

1580
01:44:18,796 --> 01:44:21,140
Not very convincing. I suggest this.

1581
01:44:21,666 --> 01:44:24,203
You were on your way to class
when I called you over...

1582
01:44:24,369 --> 01:44:26,872
...and gave you a lecture
on your slovenly appearance.

1583
01:44:27,038 --> 01:44:30,451
If asked,
you will bear that out, Mr. Staefel?

1584
01:44:30,608 --> 01:44:31,814
All right, boy? Cut along.

1585
01:44:31,976 --> 01:44:33,011
Yes, sir.

1586
01:44:33,177 --> 01:44:35,316
Thanks awfully.

1587
01:44:37,348 --> 01:44:39,919
Just as unfeeling.

1588
01:44:40,084 --> 01:44:41,358
What?

1589
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:43,465
No matter.

1590
01:44:47,892 --> 01:44:52,238
Dear fellow, this will be the last time
we shall take this little walk together.

1591
01:44:52,397 --> 01:44:54,775
Tomorrow is Founder's Day...

1592
01:44:55,300 --> 01:44:58,804
...and the day after, I leave for Germany.

1593
01:44:59,237 --> 01:45:02,013
Is that your choice?

1594
01:45:02,173 --> 01:45:05,245
Dear fellow,
how can you possibly think it is my choice?

1595
01:45:06,511 --> 01:45:10,152
So it will be goodbye.

1596
01:45:12,717 --> 01:45:14,628
Do you have to go?

1597
01:45:14,786 --> 01:45:18,757
All German citizens
have been ordered home by the Führer.

1598
01:45:19,257 --> 01:45:21,294
- Disobey.
-I have a mother in Dresden.

1599
01:45:21,459 --> 01:45:23,769
- They wouldn't do anything--
-They would.

1600
01:45:23,928 --> 01:45:27,398
Dear fellow, they would.
and well we both know it.

1601
01:45:28,599 --> 01:45:34,641
She's an old lady, I know,
but, uh, I still love her very much, and...

1602
01:45:41,145 --> 01:45:46,618
The world has grown a little unlovely.
don't you think?

1603
01:45:49,053 --> 01:45:51,260
No, of course you don't.

1604
01:45:51,756 --> 01:45:54,134
How lucky you English are.

1605
01:45:54,892 --> 01:45:58,271
And how little you always appreciate it.

1606
01:46:07,071 --> 01:46:08,607
What on earth's this?

1607
01:46:08,773 --> 01:46:11,379
Anniversary, I' d forgotten .

1608
01:46:35,266 --> 01:46:38,213
Have you gone out of your mind?

1609
01:46:38,770 --> 01:46:39,805
It's Apollo, isn't it?

1610
01:46:39,971 --> 01:46:41,075
Of course it's Apollo.

1611
01:46:41,472 --> 01:46:44,612
- It comes from quite near Paestum.
-It also comes from Pinkerton's.

1612
01:46:44,776 --> 01:46:46,915
- Mole soup, Maxwell?
- Thank you, Mrs. Chipping.

1613
01:46:47,078 --> 01:46:48,853
I happened to be passing Pinkerton's--

1614
01:46:49,013 --> 01:46:50,822
Everyone passes Pinkerton's.

1615
01:46:50,982 --> 01:46:54,862
No one who isn't called Rothschild
or Rockefeller ever goes in.

1616
01:46:55,019 --> 01:46:57,590
This, madam.
must have cost you well over three figures.

1617
01:46:57,755 --> 01:46:59,530
I'm not that well-off.

1618
01:47:00,358 --> 01:47:02,702
Well, don't you think it's beautiful?

1619
01:47:02,860 --> 01:47:04,965
I think the Taj Mahal is beautiful.

1620
01:47:05,129 --> 01:47:08,042
I don't expect it
as an anniversary present.

1621
01:47:08,733 --> 01:47:13,045
I've never known anyone more wickedly
or wantonly extravagant than my wife.

1622
01:47:13,504 --> 01:47:14,744
What's more.

1623
01:47:14,906 --> 01:47:17,546
- Those curtains over there are new.
-Yes, sir.

1624
01:47:17,708 --> 01:47:20,052
- As it so happens--
-You thought I wouldn't notice.

1625
01:47:20,211 --> 01:47:23,158
Now, how much did they cost?
No, don't tell me. I'll have a stroke.

1626
01:47:26,651 --> 01:47:27,755
I beg you to remember...

1627
01:47:27,919 --> 01:47:31,298
...you are no longer earning hundreds
of pounds a week in Phyllis from Finchley.

1628
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:33,265
Flossie from Fulham. Finished, Benson?

1629
01:47:33,424 --> 01:47:35,700
You are the wife
of an impoverished schoolmaster.

1630
01:47:35,860 --> 01:47:37,023
One thing's very certain.

1631
01:47:37,124 --> 01:47:40,206
I can't, unhappily, send the
curtains back, but this I can.

1632
01:47:40,364 --> 01:47:41,866
And will.

1633
01:47:42,233 --> 01:47:44,304
Directly after lunch .

1634
01:47:44,669 --> 01:47:47,445
You will then go down
to Woolworth's and buy me something...

1635
01:47:47,605 --> 01:47:49,380
...I really want.

1636
01:47:52,276 --> 01:47:54,847
It's no laughing matter, I assure you.

1637
01:47:55,012 --> 01:47:58,016
You must learn your lesson
or take the consequences.

1638
01:47:58,382 --> 01:47:59,793
Yes, dear.

1639
01:48:19,370 --> 01:48:21,850
Does this have to be here?

1640
01:48:22,173 --> 01:48:24,119
No, dear. Anywhere you like it.

1641
01:48:24,609 --> 01:48:26,680
What is it, anyway?

1642
01:48:27,145 --> 01:48:30,388
It's the parasol I had
in Phyllis from Finchley.

1643
01:48:30,548 --> 01:48:31,891
Ah.

1644
01:48:32,150 --> 01:48:36,565
Yes, well, this wouldn't look right there.

1645
01:48:36,721 --> 01:48:38,928
Well, maybe the whatnot.

1646
01:48:42,493 --> 01:48:43,767
Come in.

1647
01:48:44,362 --> 01:48:46,467
Katherine.
I just had to come and talk to you.

1648
01:48:46,631 --> 01:48:50,738
Oh, Katherine. I heard every word
that old brute said to you at lunch...

1649
01:48:50,902 --> 01:48:53,405
...and I knew how you'd be feeling...

1650
01:49:03,147 --> 01:49:04,956
Katherine?

1651
01:49:05,416 --> 01:49:07,623
Did that boy call you Katherine?

1652
01:49:08,152 --> 01:49:10,632
Do you allow boys to call you
by your Christian name?

1653
01:49:10,788 --> 01:49:12,324
Not all boys, no.

1654
01:49:12,490 --> 01:49:13,628
But this boy?

1655
01:49:15,259 --> 01:49:16,704
Most outrageous.

1656
01:49:16,861 --> 01:49:18,465
How shall I put it?

1657
01:49:18,629 --> 01:49:20,836
This boy, I take it, is in love with you.

1658
01:49:20,998 --> 01:49:22,272
Don't blame him.

1659
01:49:22,433 --> 01:49:25,744
No, I do not blame him, I blame you
for encouraging him.

1660
01:49:25,903 --> 01:49:27,644
- Flirting with him, no doubt.
-Ha, ha, ha.

1661
01:49:27,805 --> 01:49:30,308
And who, play, is the old brute?

1662
01:49:32,076 --> 01:49:33,749
You.

1663
01:49:33,911 --> 01:49:34,946
I thought as much.

1664
01:49:35,112 --> 01:49:38,184
A fine conspiracy you've been having,
you two, behind my unsuspecting back.

1665
01:49:38,349 --> 01:49:41,159
It's unlucky for you, isn't it,
that I've nipped your pranks in the bud?

1666
01:49:43,187 --> 01:49:44,427
Yes, Mrs. Chipping?

1667
01:49:44,589 --> 01:49:47,433
And what precisely
do you have to say to that?

1668
01:49:47,758 --> 01:49:50,261
How do you nip a plank in the bud?

1669
01:49:52,930 --> 01:49:54,307
What have I married?

1670
01:49:54,465 --> 01:49:55,739
That's what I ask myself.

1671
01:49:55,900 --> 01:49:57,937
We'll speak of this later.

1672
01:50:17,588 --> 01:50:21,001
You smiled

1673
01:50:21,158 --> 01:50:24,139
I smiled

1674
01:50:24,295 --> 01:50:29,040
We smiled

1675
01:50:29,634 --> 01:50:36,643
It was love

1676
01:50:48,252 --> 01:50:53,463
This is quite definitely the place for it.
I can't think why we ever argued.

1677
01:51:01,399 --> 01:51:03,777
Thank you for your message.

1678
01:51:03,934 --> 01:51:05,436
I meant it.

1679
01:51:06,037 --> 01:51:08,108
You were quite light
to laugh at me just now.

1680
01:51:08,272 --> 01:51:11,219
But you see.
I resent you looking so young.

1681
01:51:11,676 --> 01:51:16,022
If you looked older,
boys wouldn't fall in love with you...

1682
01:51:16,180 --> 01:51:18,956
...and you'd look
like a headmaster's wife.

1683
01:51:21,485 --> 01:51:22,555
You said " headmaster."

1684
01:51:23,054 --> 01:51:24,124
I meant "housemaster."

1685
01:51:24,288 --> 01:51:26,928
- But you said "headmaster."
- It was a slip of the tongue.

1686
01:51:27,091 --> 01:51:29,435
You've heard something.
Now, come on, tell me.

1687
01:51:29,593 --> 01:51:31,368
Tell me what you've heard.

1688
01:51:31,529 --> 01:51:34,840
Just that I had a word
with the chairman of governors yesterday...

1689
01:51:34,999 --> 01:51:37,741
...and he gave me to understand
that a certain matter...

1690
01:51:37,902 --> 01:51:41,372
...may be what you would call
"in the bag."

1691
01:51:41,539 --> 01:51:44,611
Oh, Chips, and you never told me.

1692
01:51:44,775 --> 01:51:47,483
That boy is quite light.
You are an old brute.

1693
01:51:47,645 --> 01:51:49,921
Well, I thought it might bring bad luck.

1694
01:51:50,081 --> 01:51:52,527
There's no such thing.

1695
01:51:52,683 --> 01:51:57,632
Oh, darling, darling, Chips,
I'm so happy for you.

1696
01:51:57,788 --> 01:52:00,234
I'm rather happy for myself.

1697
01:52:03,461 --> 01:52:05,304
School days, so they tell us

1698
01:52:05,463 --> 01:52:08,842
Are the most sublime of our lives

1699
01:52:08,999 --> 01:52:14,677
We'll have the time of our lives
It's the absolute prime of our lives

1700
01:52:14,839 --> 01:52:18,480
Yes, there are school days
That are golden

1701
01:52:18,642 --> 01:52:21,350
In the olden days,
it might have been true

1702
01:52:21,512 --> 01:52:26,655
But in the olden days they liked torture
And slavery too

1703
01:52:26,817 --> 01:52:28,228
What are you going to do?

1704
01:52:28,386 --> 01:52:34,302
School days, so we gather
Are the sweetest days that we'll know

1705
01:52:34,458 --> 01:52:40,067
And if that really is so
Well, it comes as a bit of a blow

1706
01:52:40,231 --> 01:52:44,145
I mean
If school days are the best of our lives

1707
01:52:44,301 --> 01:52:47,111
Imagine the rest of our lives

1708
01:52:47,271 --> 01:52:50,275
School days, school days

1709
01:52:50,641 --> 01:52:53,850
Never let me go

1710
01:52:54,678 --> 01:52:56,385
Come on.

1711
01:52:56,981 --> 01:52:59,257
- School days
-When I think of them

1712
01:52:59,417 --> 01:53:00,760
Are sublime

1713
01:53:00,918 --> 01:53:03,489
And you're sick of them
You can take your pick of them

1714
01:53:03,654 --> 01:53:05,759
- School days
- Work for scholarship

1715
01:53:05,923 --> 01:53:08,199
- What a time
- Lovable Mr. Chips

1716
01:53:08,359 --> 01:53:09,736
Talk about dictatorships

1717
01:53:09,894 --> 01:53:13,671
School days, they're the best
Oh, it's plain they are

1718
01:53:13,831 --> 01:53:16,368
It's plain they are
Cruel and inhumane they are

1719
01:53:16,534 --> 01:53:18,741
- School days
- Slightly insane they are

1720
01:53:18,903 --> 01:53:21,179
- That's the test
- It's just plain they are

1721
01:53:21,338 --> 01:53:22,874
Have you missed them?

1722
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:25,384
I'll miss sunny high school days

1723
01:53:25,543 --> 01:53:26,988
- Sunny high
- Tap brass

1724
01:53:27,144 --> 01:53:28,919
- Sunny high
- School days

1725
01:53:29,079 --> 01:53:33,391
- Holidays
- School days, school days

1726
01:53:33,551 --> 01:53:38,193
Never let me

1727
01:53:42,893 --> 01:53:45,874
School days, school days
School days, school days

1728
01:53:46,030 --> 01:53:51,537
Never ever let me go

1729
01:53:57,875 --> 01:54:00,481
Oh, you were marvellous.

1730
01:54:00,644 --> 01:54:01,714
Don't worry.

1731
01:54:01,879 --> 01:54:03,825
I would like to congratulate...

1732
01:54:03,981 --> 01:54:05,858
...on your behalf, all those concerned...

1733
01:54:06,016 --> 01:54:12,524
...in this year's Founder's Night concert,
especially Mrs. Chipping.

1734
01:54:15,426 --> 01:54:19,636
And congratulations also
to her sprightly and dashing chorus.

1735
01:54:21,665 --> 01:54:26,614
I'm only sad that it will be my last
as headmaster.

1736
01:54:26,770 --> 01:54:31,617
And now, before I take my leave,
I must give you the news...

1737
01:54:31,775 --> 01:54:35,723
...for which, I have no doubt,
many of you are eagerly waiting...

1738
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:40,488
...and which the governors have asked me
to convey to you tonight.

1739
01:54:43,053 --> 01:54:47,661
The name of the man whom,
after prolonged deliberations...

1740
01:54:48,225 --> 01:54:53,368
...they have chosen to succeed me
as headmaster of Brookfield.

1741
01:54:55,533 --> 01:55:02,041
Their choice has fallen
on Mr. William Stanley Baxter, M.A..

1742
01:55:28,899 --> 01:55:31,209
I'm so very sorry.

1743
01:55:34,672 --> 01:55:37,482
How very kind of you.
Thank you very much.

1744
01:55:38,475 --> 01:55:42,252
You have
my most sincere congratulations.

1745
01:55:42,613 --> 01:55:45,856
My dear Chipping.
how very good of you.

1746
01:55:46,317 --> 01:55:48,194
- Excuse me, my dear.
-Of course.

1747
01:55:50,187 --> 01:55:52,758
You can understand
my embarrassment, I'm sure...

1748
01:55:52,923 --> 01:55:56,632
...but I have it on excellent authority
that the governors intended no slight...

1749
01:55:56,794 --> 01:55:58,569
...whatsoever to you as senior master.

1750
01:55:58,729 --> 01:56:01,573
It was simply a question of age.

1751
01:56:02,366 --> 01:56:04,937
I understand perfectly.

1752
01:56:06,036 --> 01:56:07,913
Katherine?

1753
01:56:09,006 --> 01:56:11,008
Ale you still there?

1754
01:56:13,711 --> 01:56:15,418
Just coming up.

1755
01:56:20,651 --> 01:56:24,360
Dear Mr. Baxter, I'm so very glad for you.

1756
01:56:24,521 --> 01:56:26,899
It must have been a wonderful surprise.

1757
01:56:27,725 --> 01:56:29,636
Yes, it was.

1758
01:56:33,831 --> 01:56:37,438
Where will you be watching
the fireworks from, the river?

1759
01:56:37,901 --> 01:56:39,278
Very likely.

1760
01:56:40,571 --> 01:56:42,244
I'll see you there.

1761
01:56:43,073 --> 01:56:44,279
Excuse me.

1762
01:56:44,441 --> 01:56:45,852
Come along.

1763
01:56:51,749 --> 01:56:55,925
Those mean,
ungrateful old swine of governors.

1764
01:56:56,086 --> 01:56:58,362
What I wouldn't do to them
if I had the chance.

1765
01:56:58,522 --> 01:57:00,297
Quiet, dear.

1766
01:57:00,457 --> 01:57:03,870
The milk is spilt. Don't let's cry.
Go and change.

1767
01:57:05,095 --> 01:57:06,836
I won't cry.

1768
01:57:08,799 --> 01:57:11,075
I wouldn't dream of crying.

1769
01:57:47,404 --> 01:57:49,941
You could have imagined my feelings.

1770
01:57:50,107 --> 01:57:51,984
I had no chance to warn you.

1771
01:57:52,142 --> 01:57:53,849
Sutterwick, I suppose.

1772
01:57:54,011 --> 01:57:55,649
He turned the screws very hard.

1773
01:57:56,013 --> 01:57:59,358
There's been some question
of the school being evacuated...

1774
01:57:59,516 --> 01:58:03,225
...in the event of war.
since we're so close to London.

1775
01:58:03,387 --> 01:58:06,163
Sutterwick said he was prepared to fight
at cabinet level...

1776
01:58:06,323 --> 01:58:09,998
...for our exemption, provided that...

1777
01:58:10,160 --> 01:58:12,162
A valuable concession.

1778
01:58:12,896 --> 01:58:14,466
Headmaster...

1779
01:58:14,998 --> 01:58:18,468
...will you be seeing the chairman
of governors down at the river?

1780
01:58:18,635 --> 01:58:19,978
Yes.

1781
01:58:21,238 --> 01:58:23,878
I would like you to tender him
my resignation.

1782
01:58:24,908 --> 01:58:26,216
You're not serious.

1783
01:58:26,376 --> 01:58:27,548
Perfectly.

1784
01:58:28,345 --> 01:58:30,825
I can't work under Baxter...

1785
01:58:31,749 --> 01:58:34,161
...and I don't intend to try.

1786
01:58:34,818 --> 01:58:37,492
Dear man, you must think this over.

1787
01:58:37,654 --> 01:58:41,727
I don't need to.
My mind is entirely made up.

1788
01:58:42,559 --> 01:58:44,436
I won't back down.

1789
01:58:45,796 --> 01:58:47,434
Headmaster.

1790
01:58:58,475 --> 01:59:01,456
Do you think I shouldn't have resigned?

1791
01:59:06,116 --> 01:59:08,187
Oh, I didn't say that.

1792
01:59:09,887 --> 01:59:14,029
I said you were light to do
whatever you thought was light.

1793
01:59:15,092 --> 01:59:19,632
Must seem rather petty, I suppose.
but you see...

1794
01:59:20,297 --> 01:59:23,244
...l wanted it so much for you.

1795
01:59:24,168 --> 01:59:27,479
It wasn't much to offer you
for all I took away from your life...

1796
01:59:27,638 --> 01:59:31,643
...when we married.
but at least it was something.

1797
01:59:40,684 --> 01:59:43,062
What did you take away from me?

1798
01:59:43,220 --> 01:59:49,034
Oh, success and money, gaiety.

1799
01:59:49,359 --> 01:59:50,929
A hundred, hundred things...

1800
01:59:51,094 --> 01:59:54,871
...for which I've never been able
to give you anything in return.

1801
01:59:56,066 --> 01:59:58,307
Not even children.

1802
02:00:01,905 --> 02:00:04,249
Now, don't be absurd, Chips.

1803
02:00:08,111 --> 02:00:11,456
That's far more likely to be my fault
than yours.

1804
02:00:15,018 --> 02:00:17,828
Anyway, who wants children?

1805
02:00:18,755 --> 02:00:19,995
You do.

1806
02:00:20,157 --> 02:00:21,864
I know you do.

1807
02:00:23,227 --> 02:00:26,037
You've always wanted them desperately.

1808
02:00:29,099 --> 02:00:32,478
But darling, I have hundreds of children.

1809
02:00:35,606 --> 02:00:37,449
All boys.

1810
02:00:44,281 --> 02:00:46,261
Oh, Katherine.

1811
02:01:09,172 --> 02:01:10,480
Headmaster.

1812
02:01:10,641 --> 02:01:13,485
Forgive this intrusion so late, Chips.

1813
02:01:15,312 --> 02:01:19,590
I've seen the chairman of governors,
and he feels that with war so imminent...

1814
02:01:19,750 --> 02:01:22,321
...Brookfield cannot spare
any master at all...

1815
02:01:22,486 --> 02:01:24,966
...especially one of your qualities
and experience...

1816
02:01:25,122 --> 02:01:27,932
...and your immense value to the school.

1817
02:01:28,091 --> 02:01:29,195
Did he use those words?

1818
02:01:31,061 --> 02:01:32,870
And many more.

1819
02:01:33,430 --> 02:01:37,901
He wants me to say that he begs you
on his knees to reconsider your verdict.

1820
02:01:38,669 --> 02:01:40,444
What may I tell him?

1821
02:01:57,654 --> 02:02:01,466
That I'll consider it.

1822
02:02:01,959 --> 02:02:03,597
Ah, good.

1823
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:07,640
Good for you
and good for Brookfield.

1824
02:02:08,498 --> 02:02:10,944
- Good night, Katherine.
-Good night.

1825
02:02:35,759 --> 02:02:37,830
On his knees, eh?

1826
02:02:39,663 --> 02:02:43,076
Well, that's just where he should be
to my husband.

1827
02:02:53,210 --> 02:02:55,315
This deserves something.

1828
02:03:04,921 --> 02:03:08,061
You and I

1829
02:03:08,492 --> 02:03:13,066
Have travelled far together

1830
02:03:13,897 --> 02:03:19,506
We've pursued our little star together

1831
02:03:19,669 --> 02:03:24,641
We are happy as we are together

1832
02:03:24,808 --> 02:03:29,553
We may never get to heaven

1833
02:03:29,713 --> 02:03:36,221
But it's heaven at least to try

1834
02:03:39,389 --> 02:03:44,134
You and I are going on together

1835
02:03:44,294 --> 02:03:48,834
Till the time we have is gone together

1836
02:03:48,999 --> 02:03:53,414
Watch the evening drawing on together

1837
02:03:53,570 --> 02:03:57,985
Growing older, growing closer

1838
02:03:58,141 --> 02:04:04,649
Making memories that light the sky

1839
02:04:05,182 --> 02:04:09,289
That only time can make

1840
02:04:09,453 --> 02:04:13,765
That only love can make

1841
02:04:13,924 --> 02:04:20,307
That only we can make

1842
02:04:20,464 --> 02:04:25,243
You and I!

1843
02:04:29,239 --> 02:04:31,014
I'd love cocoa.

1844
02:04:31,174 --> 02:04:32,448
I couldn't find any...

1845
02:04:32,609 --> 02:04:35,419
...so I felt that champagne
would be an adequate substitute.

1846
02:04:35,579 --> 02:04:36,990
Well, all right, then.

1847
02:04:37,147 --> 02:04:39,423
- Cheers to that .
-Cheers .

1848
02:04:39,683 --> 02:04:40,684
- Dean.
- Sir.

1849
02:04:40,851 --> 02:04:42,330
- Douglas.
- Sir.

1850
02:04:42,486 --> 02:04:43,988
- Edwich.
- Sir.

1851
02:04:44,154 --> 02:04:46,464
- Edwards.
- Sir.

1852
02:04:56,399 --> 02:04:57,503
Cover, boys!

1853
02:05:08,245 --> 02:05:10,953
Oh, get off.
You're worse than a flying bomb.

1854
02:05:36,373 --> 02:05:38,853
Those flying bombs
seem to be leaching a climax today.

1855
02:05:39,009 --> 02:05:40,545
I've counted 23 since 7 a.m.

1856
02:05:40,710 --> 02:05:43,122
Don't you think
you should send the boys to shelter?

1857
02:05:43,280 --> 02:05:45,988
But if I did.
they might well be in there all day.

1858
02:05:46,149 --> 02:05:49,995
Far better than to have them out
in the open running the risk of a direct hit.

1859
02:05:50,453 --> 02:05:52,729
You must do as you see right,
headmaster...

1860
02:05:52,889 --> 02:05:56,564
...but as it is Mr. Hitler's declared intention
since the D-day landings...

1861
02:05:56,726 --> 02:05:59,900
...to paralyse all normal life
in southern England...

1862
02:06:00,063 --> 02:06:03,442
...it seems to me our plain duty
is to carry on our normal life...

1863
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:04,943
...here at Brookfield.

1864
02:06:10,473 --> 02:06:12,077
Carry on .

1865
02:06:13,510 --> 02:06:15,217
Boys?

1866
02:06:18,081 --> 02:06:19,583
- Gaye.
- Sir.

1867
02:06:19,749 --> 02:06:21,387
Breathe in. Heh, heh, heh.

1868
02:06:22,919 --> 02:06:24,990
- Yes. Yes.
-Oh.

1869
02:06:25,155 --> 02:06:27,362
Oh, I can still get into it.

1870
02:06:27,524 --> 02:06:28,901
Chips, isn't it wonderful?

1871
02:06:29,059 --> 02:06:31,665
Do you know my accompanist
Miss Honeybun?

1872
02:06:31,828 --> 02:06:33,637
How do you do?

1873
02:06:33,797 --> 02:06:35,868
Well, another concert?

1874
02:06:36,032 --> 02:06:37,636
Yes, for the RAF.

1875
02:06:37,801 --> 02:06:41,112
And the CO, believe it or not,
especially asked for "London is London."

1876
02:06:42,639 --> 02:06:46,883
Oh, well, that should be extremely....

1877
02:06:48,578 --> 02:06:50,319
Down.

1878
02:07:04,861 --> 02:07:06,932
Extremely what?

1879
02:07:07,097 --> 02:07:08,974
Diverting.

1880
02:07:09,299 --> 02:07:11,006
Oh, Chips, do you think I dare?

1881
02:07:11,167 --> 02:07:13,909
Of course you dare.
It is a charming song.

1882
02:07:14,070 --> 02:07:16,914
Liar. I'm awfully old for it.

1883
02:07:17,073 --> 02:07:19,349
Well, you're not looking awfully old.

1884
02:07:19,509 --> 02:07:23,548
Frankly, you look 18
and remarkably beautiful.

1885
02:07:23,713 --> 02:07:27,092
Mind you, I've never seen you
lying under the piano before.

1886
02:07:27,250 --> 02:07:30,390
You qualify all your compliments,
don't you?

1887
02:07:32,322 --> 02:07:35,166
Uh, it's gone "bang", Mr. Chipping.

1888
02:07:35,325 --> 02:07:38,568
Oh, I'm extremely sorry.
I was kissing my wife.

1889
02:07:38,728 --> 02:07:40,867
Oh, heh, heh. Why?

1890
02:07:41,031 --> 02:07:42,305
I don't know, really.

1891
02:07:42,465 --> 02:07:46,038
It somehow seemed a good idea
at the time.

1892
02:07:46,202 --> 02:07:48,045
Oh, yes, well...

1893
02:07:49,239 --> 02:07:51,480
Well, gentlemen, I think we're all agreed.

1894
02:07:51,641 --> 02:07:54,178
It only remains tor me
to congratulate Mr. Baxter...

1895
02:07:54,344 --> 02:07:58,087
...on his appointment
to the National Education Commission.

1896
02:07:58,248 --> 02:07:59,556
Mr. Chipping's here, sir.

1897
02:07:59,716 --> 02:08:02,595
- Send him in, Jenkins, please.
-Very good, sir.

1898
02:08:07,624 --> 02:08:10,400
Ah, Mr. Chipping, do come in.

1899
02:08:12,028 --> 02:08:13,871
Take a seat.

1900
02:08:16,232 --> 02:08:18,712
I think you know everybody here.

1901
02:08:18,868 --> 02:08:23,442
I don't expect you've heard that Baxter
is leaving us at the end of the term...

1902
02:08:23,606 --> 02:08:25,745
...for an important state appointment.

1903
02:08:26,276 --> 02:08:27,414
No, I haven't.

1904
02:08:27,877 --> 02:08:31,256
Nor had we, till yesterday.

1905
02:08:31,715 --> 02:08:36,061
Well, Chipping, I'm happy to tell you
that I am in a position...

1906
02:08:36,219 --> 02:08:38,495
...in full agreement with my colleagues--

1907
02:08:38,655 --> 02:08:41,727
In fairly full agreement
with my colleagues.

1908
02:08:41,891 --> 02:08:47,136
--To offer you, at long last, the position
which I and some of my colleagues...

1909
02:08:47,297 --> 02:08:51,268
...regretted we could not offer you
in 1939.

1910
02:09:18,294 --> 02:09:21,104
- Katherine!
- Wish me luck.

1911
02:09:21,264 --> 02:09:24,507
- I've something to tell you.
-What?

1912
02:09:24,667 --> 02:09:27,045
I've been made headmaster!

1913
02:09:27,203 --> 02:09:30,650
I can't hear you, tell me later.

1914
02:09:30,807 --> 02:09:32,514
Bye.

1915
02:09:36,613 --> 02:09:38,854
Look out, Chips.

1916
02:09:41,251 --> 02:09:43,288
Sit, boys.

1917
02:09:44,320 --> 02:09:47,733
I am extremely sorry
for having kept you waiting.

1918
02:09:47,891 --> 02:09:51,805
No doubt you all found
many useful ways of employing the time.

1919
02:09:52,328 --> 02:09:54,035
You in particular, Farley.

1920
02:09:54,197 --> 02:09:56,177
Yes, sir.
I've done my prep all over again.

1921
02:09:56,332 --> 02:10:02,180
I've no doubt at all.
Well, that being the case, you can begin.

1922
02:10:04,607 --> 02:10:08,453
Page 38, line 12.

1923
02:10:08,611 --> 02:10:10,284
Down.

1924
02:10:24,761 --> 02:10:28,106
Don't you think Hitler seems to be aiming
at us particularly today, sir?

1925
02:10:28,264 --> 02:10:33,270
You fancy a special order
has been sent out to the Luftwaffe?

1926
02:10:33,436 --> 02:10:36,076
"Get Farley at all costs"?

1927
02:10:38,441 --> 02:10:40,682
What's the principle
of a flying bomb, sir?

1928
02:10:40,844 --> 02:10:46,021
Ah, Farley, you don't divert me
quite so easily from Caesar's Gallic Wars.

1929
02:10:46,182 --> 02:10:48,753
If you'll turn to page 40...

1930
02:10:48,918 --> 02:10:54,266
...and begin at the bottom line.
you will have your answer.

1931
02:10:55,158 --> 02:10:56,466
I don't understand it, sir.

1932
02:10:58,328 --> 02:11:01,332
Gresham, would you do it?

1933
02:11:07,470 --> 02:11:10,110
This was the kind of fighting...

1934
02:11:13,476 --> 02:11:16,753
...in which the Germans
busied themselves.

1935
02:11:17,614 --> 02:11:20,788
- Oh, very good, sir.
- Yes, sir. very good.

1936
02:11:20,950 --> 02:11:22,327
- Pretty good.
- Very good.

1937
02:11:22,485 --> 02:11:28,527
You can see how these dead languages
can sometimes come to life again.

1938
02:11:28,691 --> 02:11:31,467
Now, Farley, back to page 38. Begin.

1939
02:11:31,628 --> 02:11:34,131
Please, sir, may we ask
a question, sir, first?

1940
02:11:34,297 --> 02:11:37,801
- We're all longing to know...
-What?

1941
02:11:37,967 --> 02:11:41,414
Well, if the rumor's true, sir.
that you've been made headmaster.

1942
02:11:41,571 --> 02:11:46,213
It's not really a question
you should ask or I answer.

1943
02:11:47,544 --> 02:11:50,218
But, yes, Farley.
it does happen to be true.

1944
02:11:53,716 --> 02:11:56,094
Quiet, please. Quiet.

1945
02:11:57,453 --> 02:12:02,869
I can only say I am very surprised.
very surprised, indeed.

1946
02:12:04,360 --> 02:12:07,000
Thank you all very much.

1947
02:12:07,730 --> 02:12:09,801
Now, Farley, your kindly interruption...

1948
02:12:09,966 --> 02:12:13,539
...has not saved you from translating
Caesar to me for the next five minutes.

1949
02:12:13,703 --> 02:12:15,410
Begin, please.

1950
02:12:26,482 --> 02:12:30,692
Our men attacked the enemy...

1951
02:12:30,853 --> 02:12:34,266
...so fiercely when...

1952
02:12:35,491 --> 02:12:38,062
When the signal was given.

1953
02:13:04,320 --> 02:13:06,459
Altogether now, one more time.

1954
02:13:06,623 --> 02:13:09,502
Oh, London is London

1955
02:13:09,659 --> 02:13:10,797
Come on, now.

1956
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:12,496
London is London

1957
02:13:13,930 --> 02:13:15,932
There was a boy who.
when asked to translate into Latin...

1958
02:13:16,099 --> 02:13:18,443
...Tennyson's beautiful lines:

1959
02:13:18,601 --> 02:13:23,050
Break, break, break
On thy cold grey stones, O sea!

1960
02:13:23,206 --> 02:13:24,742
Came up with:

1961
02:13:24,907 --> 02:13:28,320
Oh, fluctus, fluctus
rumperty, rumperty, jam

1962
02:13:31,314 --> 02:13:32,384
He's now a bishop.

1963
02:13:35,184 --> 02:13:39,030
- Hitler's shut up shop for the night.
- Yes, Farley, but we haven't.

1964
02:13:39,188 --> 02:13:41,600
This is a double hour.
and we still have another 20 minutes.

1965
02:13:42,959 --> 02:13:44,495
Enter.

1966
02:13:47,964 --> 02:13:50,740
Excuse me, sir.
Would you be Mr. Chipping?

1967
02:13:50,900 --> 02:13:54,438
- Yes.
-Could I see you alone for a moment, sir?

1968
02:13:54,604 --> 02:13:56,709
Certainly, officer .

1969
02:13:58,975 --> 02:14:01,046
Gresham?

1970
02:14:04,313 --> 02:14:07,385
Look, chaps. I've got a marvellous idea.
Let's play a joke on him.

1971
02:14:07,550 --> 02:14:10,622
Let's write him letters of congratulation
and put them on his desk.

1972
02:14:10,787 --> 02:14:13,290
- We haven't time.
-We don't need to write anything.

1973
02:14:13,456 --> 02:14:16,403
Folded up bits of paper with
"headmaster of Brookfield" on them.

1974
02:14:16,559 --> 02:14:17,629
Well, come on.

1975
02:14:20,296 --> 02:14:22,207
I've put something in mine.
Wanna hear it?

1976
02:14:22,365 --> 02:14:23,469
- No.
- I put:

1977
02:14:23,633 --> 02:14:27,012
"Gosh, they must be hard up
for headmasters these days."

1978
02:15:02,572 --> 02:15:04,347
Sir?

1979
02:15:08,778 --> 02:15:10,553
Sir?

1980
02:15:15,384 --> 02:15:16,988
Yes?

1981
02:15:17,453 --> 02:15:20,400
There are some letters on your desk.

1982
02:15:21,891 --> 02:15:25,600
- Letters?
- Yes, you've got your elbow on them.

1983
02:15:36,472 --> 02:15:38,383
But there's nothing inside.

1984
02:15:39,742 --> 02:15:42,518
Look at the other side, sir.

1985
02:15:48,217 --> 02:15:51,755
"Headmaster of Brookfield."

1986
02:15:57,426 --> 02:16:00,930
Mrs. Chips. She's been killed.

1987
02:16:20,449 --> 02:16:22,520
Could I have mine back, please, sir?

1988
02:16:23,186 --> 02:16:24,756
What?

1989
02:16:28,958 --> 02:16:30,904
Farley.

1990
02:16:32,128 --> 02:16:34,369
Yours back, why?

1991
02:16:36,732 --> 02:16:38,370
I'd just like it back, sir.

1992
02:16:38,534 --> 02:16:40,536
That's the one.
You've got it in your hand.

1993
02:16:43,272 --> 02:16:44,876
Don't lead it, sir.

1994
02:16:47,877 --> 02:16:49,720
Why not?

1995
02:16:53,983 --> 02:16:57,897
"Gosh, they must be hard up...

1996
02:16:58,054 --> 02:17:03,094
...for headmasters these days."

1997
02:17:07,763 --> 02:17:09,436
I didn't mean it, sir.

1998
02:17:11,467 --> 02:17:14,073
But it's perfectly true.

1999
02:17:14,237 --> 02:17:15,910
It was a...

2000
02:17:17,607 --> 02:17:19,587
...joke, sir.

2001
02:17:20,810 --> 02:17:24,519
Yes, a joke.

2002
02:17:50,640 --> 02:17:52,449
Wouldn't you like to go home, sir?

2003
02:18:01,751 --> 02:18:03,196
No.

2004
02:18:07,156 --> 02:18:08,760
We, uh...

2005
02:18:09,525 --> 02:18:14,474
We still have another 10 minutes
to the bell.

2006
02:18:18,367 --> 02:18:22,440
Would one of you be good enough...

2007
02:18:22,605 --> 02:18:25,017
...to translate?

2008
02:18:35,318 --> 02:18:41,234
Such things being so...

2009
02:18:42,258 --> 02:18:45,068
...hostages were...

2010
02:18:45,227 --> 02:18:51,269
Hostages having been exchanged.

2011
02:19:36,445 --> 02:19:40,791
And now, before passing to the events
of the corning school week...

2012
02:19:40,950 --> 02:19:46,423
...l hope you will forgive me if I make
an announcement regarding myself.

2013
02:19:47,790 --> 02:19:53,604
This is the last time
I will be addressing you as headmaster.

2014
02:19:54,330 --> 02:19:59,370
Like so many others, my services
have come to an end with the war...

2015
02:19:59,535 --> 02:20:02,675
...and next term.
you'll have another headmaster.

2016
02:20:02,838 --> 02:20:04,681
Shame.

2017
02:20:07,309 --> 02:20:12,156
Well, I thank the boy who said, "Shame."

2018
02:20:12,314 --> 02:20:16,956
But if it was the boy
I think it was, Farley, T.F...

2019
02:20:17,520 --> 02:20:22,526
...l must tell you, he is by nature
a little prone to exaggerate.

2020
02:20:22,691 --> 02:20:27,936
I may remind him I once had occasion
to reprimand him for exaggeration.

2021
02:20:28,097 --> 02:20:33,445
I gave him one mark for an exercise,
and he exaggerated it into seven.

2022
02:20:35,037 --> 02:20:37,881
- We all know Farley.
- I'm giving him too.

2023
02:20:40,476 --> 02:20:44,652
Well, now. I thank you all, then.
but I beg to remind you...

2024
02:20:44,814 --> 02:20:47,556
...that I haven't really been
headmaster at all.

2025
02:20:47,716 --> 02:20:51,892
Just acting, temporary, on probation.

2026
02:20:52,054 --> 02:20:56,560
Oh, yes, I know my portrait's up there
with all the others...

2027
02:20:56,725 --> 02:21:03,108
...but it's an awful fraud
and quite a puzzle for posterity.

2028
02:21:03,265 --> 02:21:07,577
"How did he ever get up there?"
they'll ask themselves.

2029
02:21:07,736 --> 02:21:09,272
Well...

2030
02:21:09,438 --> 02:21:14,751
...it jolly well needed a world war to do it.
I could tell them.

2031
02:21:14,910 --> 02:21:19,518
Anyway, that war is over.

2032
02:21:19,682 --> 02:21:23,323
And now we face the future, you and I.

2033
02:21:23,486 --> 02:21:27,298
I know mine, but I don't know yours.

2034
02:21:27,456 --> 02:21:32,269
You're growing up into a new world.
a very exciting world, perhaps...

2035
02:21:32,428 --> 02:21:35,705
...but for sure a very changed world.

2036
02:21:35,865 --> 02:21:39,904
It may even be a world
that has no place for Brookfield.

2037
02:21:40,069 --> 02:21:44,518
At least, not for the Brookfield
I have known for so many years...

2038
02:21:44,673 --> 02:21:46,914
...and you still know now.

2039
02:21:47,076 --> 02:21:52,355
Well, if such changes
do come to our school...

2040
02:21:52,515 --> 02:21:55,121
...you must accept them...

2041
02:21:55,284 --> 02:21:59,733
...without lancer or bitterness.

2042
02:22:00,322 --> 02:22:06,204
As for me, I won't have
to accept any changes at all, will I?

2043
02:22:06,362 --> 02:22:11,141
Because Brookfield for me
will be only memories.

2044
02:22:11,934 --> 02:22:15,108
And they can't change
an old chap's memories...

2045
02:22:15,271 --> 02:22:18,184
...however hard they try.

2046
02:22:18,908 --> 02:22:23,015
They are memories
that I will always cherish...

2047
02:22:23,646 --> 02:22:29,358
...and for which I am now
most truly and deeply grateful.

2048
02:22:31,053 --> 02:22:33,897
Oh, uh, just one thing more.

2049
02:22:34,056 --> 02:22:37,196
I'm not leaving Brookfield altogether.

2050
02:22:37,359 --> 02:22:39,396
I'm taking looms in the town.

2051
02:22:52,441 --> 02:22:54,250
Thank you.

2052
02:22:55,144 --> 02:22:56,646
Well...

2053
02:22:57,346 --> 02:23:01,726
When you come to see me in after years,
as I hope some of you will...

2054
02:23:01,884 --> 02:23:06,333
...and you're all very gland and grown-up.
I may well not recognize you...

2055
02:23:06,488 --> 02:23:11,062
...and you'll say.
"Poor old boy, his memory's gone."

2056
02:23:11,794 --> 02:23:16,834
But you see,
I will remember you all perfectly well...

2057
02:23:16,999 --> 02:23:19,570
...because I will remember you
as you are now.

2058
02:23:19,735 --> 02:23:21,772
That's the point.

2059
02:23:21,937 --> 02:23:26,977
In my mind, you'll never grow up at all.

2060
02:23:27,142 --> 02:23:31,682
I get older, and so do all of them...

2061
02:23:31,847 --> 02:23:35,818
...but you always stay the same...

2062
02:23:36,785 --> 02:23:39,561
...and you always will.

2063
02:23:40,022 --> 02:23:43,868
And in that, I shall find...

2064
02:23:45,794 --> 02:23:50,800
...great comfort in the days to come.

2065
02:23:52,201 --> 02:23:54,181
So you see...

2066
02:23:54,336 --> 02:24:00,378
...it won't really be goodbye at all.

2067
02:24:03,412 --> 02:24:05,653
And now I come to the week's events--

2068
02:24:05,814 --> 02:24:08,351
- Three cheers for Chips. Hip-hip!
- Hooray!

2069
02:24:08,517 --> 02:24:09,791
- Hip-hip!
- Hooray!

2070
02:24:09,952 --> 02:24:12,956
- Hip-hip!
- Hooray!

2071
02:24:13,122 --> 02:24:16,501
Boys. Boys.

2072
02:24:19,395 --> 02:24:20,874
Boys.

2073
02:25:38,607 --> 02:25:40,177
What is it?

2074
02:25:40,342 --> 02:25:43,016
They said you wanted to see me, sir.

2075
02:25:53,856 --> 02:25:55,802
You're Sutterwick .

2076
02:25:55,958 --> 02:25:57,767
Yes, sir.

2077
02:26:00,696 --> 02:26:02,972
It gave me no pleasure...

2078
02:26:03,132 --> 02:26:06,670
...to stop you playing tennis
that day, you know.

2079
02:26:06,835 --> 02:26:09,315
Sir, that wasn't me.

2080
02:26:10,439 --> 02:26:11,543
Of course it was you.

2081
02:26:11,707 --> 02:26:14,210
I've only arrived this morning.
I'm a new boy.

2082
02:26:16,879 --> 02:26:18,222
Oh.

2083
02:26:19,014 --> 02:26:21,187
Yes, I see.

2084
02:26:22,451 --> 02:26:25,022
That was all a long time ago, wasn't it?

2085
02:26:25,187 --> 02:26:27,497
It must have been your father.

2086
02:26:27,656 --> 02:26:32,127
My father wasn't at Brookfield, sir.
My grandfather was.

2087
02:26:32,294 --> 02:26:36,834
Yes, of course, your grandfather.

2088
02:26:36,999 --> 02:26:42,312
And that other one.
the one who gave us the playing fields...

2089
02:26:42,471 --> 02:26:45,782
...he'd be your great grandfather.

2090
02:26:45,941 --> 02:26:47,045
Yes, sir.

2091
02:26:49,912 --> 02:26:51,721
What's happened to him?

2092
02:26:52,347 --> 02:26:53,417
Oh, he's dead, sir.

2093
02:26:55,918 --> 02:26:57,556
Yes.

2094
02:26:58,687 --> 02:27:00,667
He would be.

2095
02:27:05,761 --> 02:27:07,035
Well...

2096
02:27:08,797 --> 02:27:13,303
Just remind me, Sutterwick,
what am I supposed to see you about?

2097
02:27:13,469 --> 02:27:15,346
I don't know, sir.

2098
02:27:15,504 --> 02:27:17,984
Oh, I see.

2099
02:27:18,140 --> 02:27:20,848
It's the old leg-pull.

2100
02:27:21,009 --> 02:27:23,046
They're always sending
new boys in to me.

2101
02:27:23,212 --> 02:27:26,455
I suppose they think
they'll take one look at me...

2102
02:27:26,615 --> 02:27:30,188
...and run screaming back home
to their mothers.

2103
02:27:42,865 --> 02:27:47,439
Put that back, would you?
Very carefully.

2104
02:27:47,603 --> 02:27:50,140
I don't want it broken.

2105
02:27:53,709 --> 02:27:55,154
It's Apollo, isn't it, sir?

2106
02:27:55,878 --> 02:27:57,448
Yes, how do you know?

2107
02:27:57,613 --> 02:27:59,991
Oh, I know about Greek things.

2108
02:28:00,148 --> 02:28:02,924
Do you now? Good.

2109
02:28:03,485 --> 02:28:05,226
Taking classics, then?

2110
02:28:05,387 --> 02:28:07,060
Oh, no, sir, physics.

2111
02:28:08,056 --> 02:28:10,036
Physics.

2112
02:28:10,192 --> 02:28:15,073
Yes, that's the thing now, isn't it?
Quite the rage.

2113
02:28:16,532 --> 02:28:18,273
Where did you get that Apollo, sir?

2114
02:28:19,501 --> 02:28:21,674
It was a present from my wife.

2115
02:28:21,837 --> 02:28:23,748
You were married.

2116
02:28:24,940 --> 02:28:27,079
Why do you find that so surprising?

2117
02:28:27,242 --> 02:28:29,518
Oh, no, sir. I didn't mean that.

2118
02:28:29,678 --> 02:28:32,989
I only meant, I mean...

2119
02:28:34,182 --> 02:28:36,526
Do you have any children, sir?

2120
02:28:37,920 --> 02:28:42,869
Yes, hundreds of children.

2121
02:28:43,825 --> 02:28:45,930
All boys.

2122
02:28:51,400 --> 02:28:53,812
- Goodbye, boy.
-Goodbye, Mr. Chips.

2123
02:28:53,969 --> 02:28:56,882
- What did you call me?
-Mr. Chips.

2124
02:28:57,039 --> 02:28:59,849
Mr. Chipping or just Chips.

2125
02:29:00,008 --> 02:29:04,548
Only one person in the world
is allowed to call me Mr. Chips.

2126
02:29:08,250 --> 02:29:10,457
Was allowed to.

2127
02:29:12,654 --> 02:29:16,192
Still, that's all light, boy.

2128
02:29:17,192 --> 02:29:20,173
Have a good life at Brookfield.

2129
02:29:38,313 --> 02:29:41,851
I wonder if we were any use at all.

2130
02:29:42,618 --> 02:29:44,598
I mean.
what did we ever teach the boys?

2131
02:29:44,753 --> 02:29:47,131
How to parse a sentence in ancient Greek?

2132
02:29:47,289 --> 02:29:50,429
Was that going to help them today?
Was it?

2133
02:29:53,295 --> 02:29:59,211
Well, I suppose
we did teach them one thing:

2134
02:30:00,168 --> 02:30:03,547
How to behave to each other.

2135
02:30:04,339 --> 02:30:09,220
Yes, we did try to teach them that.

2136
02:30:09,378 --> 02:30:14,088
And is there anything more important
to teach people than that, is there?

2137
02:30:25,927 --> 02:30:30,398
In the evening of my life

2138
02:30:30,565 --> 02:30:34,536
I shall look to the sunset

2139
02:30:37,072 --> 02:30:41,077
At a moment in my life

2140
02:30:41,243 --> 02:30:44,224
When the night is due

2141
02:30:47,716 --> 02:30:51,789
And the question I shall ask

2142
02:30:51,953 --> 02:30:56,459
Only you can answer

2143
02:30:58,794 --> 02:31:01,297
Was I brave

2144
02:31:01,797 --> 02:31:06,075
And strong and true?

2145
02:31:07,169 --> 02:31:08,876
Like you?

2146
02:31:09,738 --> 02:31:11,445
Like you?

2147
02:31:26,054 --> 02:31:27,089
