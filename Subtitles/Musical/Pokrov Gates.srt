Moscow, the fifties...
It seems like it was yesterday...

23
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,909
Oh, come on:
30 years have passed!

24
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,915
But if I close my eyes,
I can clearly see...

25
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,073
This guy vrooming on the bike
with Savransky is me.

26
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,593
As you can see, I am very young.

27
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,991
I came to Moscow and studied
at the university there.

28
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,435
The moment I saw Moscow
I came to love it.

29
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,675
It embraced me passionately
with its Boulevard Ring,

30
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,990
with its Garden Ring:

31
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,831
it beckoned me into its streets,
into its curving by-streets,

32
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,994
until it left me be, totally
dumbfounded, to have some rest

33
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,830
in a communal flat
near the Pokrovsky Gates.

34
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,830
THE POKROVSKY GATES

35
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,991
This is my auntie.

36
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,671
Coming.

37
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,677
My auntie Alice,
a noble-hearted refined woman,

38
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,071
kindly sheltered me, her nephew.

39
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,199
Hello?
You want to speak with Kostya?

40
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,830
Your humble servant, my nephew,
is still sleeping.

41
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,992
He came home only at dawn.

42
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,916
Be so kind to leave your number.
Just a second, I'll take a pencil.

43
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,355
One moment.

44
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,591
Lev Evghenievich!

45
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,194

47
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,277

you stole the pencil again!

Savva, the breakfast is ready!

56
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,352
Call Khobotov, let him come too.

57
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,512
Sehr gut', Margarita Pavlovna.

58
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,199
Lev Evghenievich! Did you hear?
Go and have some breakfast!

59
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,514
Margarita Pavlovna Khobotova -
a woman of imposing virtues.

60
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,355
At that time she turned over
a new leaf in her life.

61
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,432
She was preparing herself for
a new marriage - with Savva Efimov.

62
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,989
'Danke schon', Margarita Pavlovna.

63
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,431
But her ex-husband,
Lev Evghenievich Khobotov,

64
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,751
shared their daily
repast all the same.

65
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,912
It was a triple unity, and
it aroused my quick interest.

66
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,192
- You don't eat enough.
- Thanks, I don't feel like eating.

67
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,591
What do you mean? You should
fill yourself in the morning,

68
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,194
'cause brains need energy too.

69
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,994
And my lastmost neighbor -
an artiste Arkady Velyurov.

70
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,359
He was a stand-up comedian...

71
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,674
'So here I am, before all of ye,
A serious and a funny guy.

72
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,198
'I make no bones of telling ye:
Who, how & what & when & why...

73
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,435
'Hey, stop the war, keep saying we.
Thus humour - is a remedy.

74
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,833
'A storm without? - 'tis no big deal.
Our sense of humour makes it still.

75
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,678
'The USA had quite a shock:
Is Eisenhower a hawk?

76
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,437
'Guys, I'm all for peace', he lied.
Oh what a cunning proselyte!

77
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:23,516
'Sing, sing nightingales!
Spring, spring in the veins.

78
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:30,598
'War-loving viper hisses and stings!
But Dove spreads its wings!

79
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,352
Did you like my punch lines?

80
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,195
Thank you very much,
my dear Muscovites,

81
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,514
and guests of our city, for having
come on a rendezvous with an artiste.

82
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,437
We're having the rain in the street,
but you're having fun at my concert.

83
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,991
The jokes are showering...

84
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,352
It's autumn now in Moscow, friends,
a fine and beautiful autumn.

85
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,913
But the Soviet barometers
can only show 'clear sky'!

86
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,593
Switch on the radio,
and you will hear:

87
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,832
'Clear sky in Moscow -
compared to the London fog...'.

88
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,356
I do hope, my dear friends...

89
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,910
That one nice day,
we'll hear on the radio:

90
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,198
'It's a clear sky worldwide,
the fog has melted away!'

91
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,673
I'm pleased to see
more people coming here,

92
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,355
not with standing
the inclement weather.

93
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:40,597
Specially for them I'll perform
another couplet of my friend,

94
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,751
whom I don't hesitate to call

95
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,754
the great poet Soev!
Give him a round of applause!

96
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,513
'A jazz-band made such a knack,
That I had a heart attack.

97
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,593
'Boogie-woogie: do you like it? -
But I nearly kicked the bucket.

98
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,751
Great!

99
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,598
'There was once a bum who died,
All his bum-friends bitterly cried.

100
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,994
'And two punks, right on his grave,
made a boogie-woogie rave!'

101
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,999
Sveta! Sveta!

102
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,991
Gladkova! Gladkova!

103
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,910
Sveta! Sveta!

104
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,436
I hope you remember me:
Arkady Velyurov, a stand-up artiste.

105
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,997
Wow...

106
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,432
'Firmas e bankas latino-amerikanos...

107
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,432

108
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,999
Yes?

109
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,909
- Khobotov, what does that mean?
- I just took your hair-dryer.

110
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,355
Are you going out? Don't forget,
we're having guests today.

111
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,752
- Let Savva entertain them.
- Please, don't be late.

112
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,593
I can't promise you that.

113
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,839
You bring only discomfort to me...

114
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,999
Kostya!

115
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,593
We have won!

116
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,428
Oh no, you haven't.

117
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,990
Yasha, come and join us.

118
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,989
Oh, shucks.

119
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,351
Savva Ignatievich,
go and do some shopping!

120
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,512
We're having guests today,
the Orloviches.

121
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,435
Funf Minuten', Margarita Pavlovna.
My old buddy came to see me.

122
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,353
So, you are a complete family
guy now, aren't ye?

123
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,832
As a matter of fact I am.
We're going to get married soon.

124
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,998
How it happened,
between the two of ye?

125
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,351
Yes, Savva, give us
a clean breast of things.

126
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:39,674
We lived next door during
the summer season.

127
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,910
I rented a room in a dacha.
So they lived next door.

128
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,991
So how it all developed?
Little by little?

129
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,197
You see...
Her ex, Lev Evghenievich,

130
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,591
is a phenomenal person!

131
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,432
He is a very learned guy, you know.

132
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,592
He speaks languages as a birdie
would sing its songs.

133
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,833
But for the same reason he has
lack of balance in his head.

134
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,594
When in town, he can manage so-so.

135
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,992
But when he had to face Nature,
he appeared a complete nincompoop.

136
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,998
First, they charged him the double
price for the dacha room.

137
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,192
The passports - their
registration was overdue.

138
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,514
His razor burnt down because
of the voltage difference there.

139
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,671
The same thing happened
to their flat iron.

140
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,196
Every time he'd short-circuit smth.
And the dacha in complete darkness.

141
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,989
- His wife all in tears...
- And presto - there you are.

142
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,593
Nothing of this kind on my mind.
It was just breaking my heart.

143
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,914
To see a fabulously clever woman,
a specialist on South America,

144
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:54,354
so energetic - a real commander!
And losing her heart...

145
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:00,597
I was like babysitting him.
He breaks things, I repair them.

146
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,433
Ha, you're such a smart alec!

147
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,594
Yeah, Savva, you've broken
a close-knit Soviet family.

148
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,752
You've trampled to ashes
the family hearth.

149
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,912
Kostya, don't give me that too!
It was not my initiative!

150
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,513
Once Lev Evghenievich left for town.

151
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,752
He promised to be back by dinner,
but he didn't come back.

152
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,832
He came neither by supper, nor
by breakfast, nor the next morning.

153
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,199
At this junction
she became so fidgety.

154
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,591
And in the evening, when I tried
to calm her down, she said:

155
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,558
'Stay with me, Savva Ignatievich.'

156
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,432
And you?

157
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,593
I stood 'at attention', of course,

158
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,750
We've been together since.

159
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,195
They have an apartment being built
for them. We'll move in by spring.

160
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,432
So you'll live in his apartment?

161
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,751
So what? It's their decision.
I only know my soldier's business.

162
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,989
Bingo!

163
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,998
Savva, go to the shop now!

164
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,752
Our guys speak warmly about you.

165
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,992
You were a second to none engraver.

166
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,668
Now I teach others.

167
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,435
She says: "You'd rather be a teacher,
it's more respectable."

168
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,196
She knows best, I guess.
But you were a first-class engraver!

169
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,432
I'm afraid I'm losing my hand now.
A man without a craft is nothing.

170
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,910
Take, for example, Lev Evghenievich.

171
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,429
...Thanks.

172
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,352
Oh, thanks.
It felt great.

173
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,909
I'm glad to hear this.

174
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:22,351
- You did it so...you know...
- Oh really?

175
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,357
- It was a masterpiece of a shot!
- Oh, come on...

176
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,830
- I didn't feel anything.
- Too bad.

177
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,518
No, I meant the place
where you inserted the syringe.

178
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,194
As for the rest, it did
touch my feelings.

179
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,999
But today you had
your last injection.

180
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,193
Don't say that. I beg you!

181
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:53,992
I've got used to coming here,
to seeing you.

182
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,595
I've got used to your hands,

183
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,991
to the features of your face,
to your mimicry.

184
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,194
There is nothing special about me.

185
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:11,434
Oh, how wrong you are,
how wrong!

186
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,433
You remember my first coming here?

187
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,193
- You forgot the referral.
- Oh yes!

188
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,353
Any other woman would have
sent me away, but you...

189
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,833
- Allow me to kiss your hand.
- Oh, please don't.

190
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,751
Just to kiss your hand a farewell.

191
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,275
Yes? Close the door!

192
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,830
- For how more long?
- Close the door and wait.

193
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,276
- Do I keep you from working?
- Oh, not at all.

194
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,991
It's autumn now already.

195
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,351
Soon it will be raining,
the wind will start howling...

196
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,513
The season of influenza!
You should keep your feet warm.

197
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,356
Thank you. Oh how I thank you!

198
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,514
Doesn't your wife
take care of you?

199
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,513
My wife? You see, she is...

200
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,593
She is a very busy person, she lives
an intensive spiritual life...

201
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,991
Besides, we've parted our ways.

202
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,911
- She went away?
- Not in the strict sense of it, but...

203
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,994
...she just stepped out.
- God Almighty!

204
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,351
- She fell in love with another guy.
- For crying outloud!

205
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,752
'What is there left to a lover?
A farewell word. Slowly dies

206
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:53,995
'A fire of Indian summer.
Then - silence, thin layers of ice...'

207
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,760
A verse? Did you write it?

208
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,629
No, someone else.
He died of consumption.

209
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:06,432
- How horrible!
- I'd like to see you again.

210
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,352
But I don't know where
we can see each other.

211
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,511
Well, there are places.

212
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,592
There is a laboratory on the corner.

213
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,830
People bring their tests there...

214
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,198
If you don't mind,
I'll be waiting for you there.

215
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,953
Have you finished?

216
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,753
- You're being very popular.
- No, vitamin injections are.

217
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,992
Too many neurological patients.
We're scarce of the personnel.

218
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,751
What about our date?

219
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,194
All right. After I finish work.

220
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,192
Oh, thank you!

221
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,592
Thank you very much!

222
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,193
- Well?
- Get undressed!..

223
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,991
'So here I am, before all of ye,
A serious and a funny guy...'

224
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,989
Kostya, it's for you.
What do I tell them?

225
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,919
Let them call later.
Thanks.

226
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,992
I'm sorry, my dear,
but Kostya is a bit busy now.

227
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,191
He is taking a shower.

228
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,676
Will you please leave your telephone
number. I'll take it down.

229
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,118
One second, I'll take the pencil.
Dictate!..

230
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,596
Could you be a little more quiet -
I'm working with an author!

231
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,671
I'm sorry, I'm very sorry.
Dictate!

232
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,996
Soev, my dear friend...

233
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,993
- What does that all mean?
- It's Savva Ignatievich working.

234
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,191
No, I didn't speak to you.
Dictate!

235
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,193
He is wrong to think
we have a workshop here!

236
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:09,196
Soev, my dear friend,
please, just hump yourself.

237
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,351
You're a great talent.

238
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,353
I don't know what you want from me.

239
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,991
- You want too much.
- It's my style.

240
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,352
Yes, but remember
how you failed too.

241
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,513
Temperament - yes, but at the same
time - austere expressive means.

242
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,272
Well, I'll talk with
my wife about this.

243
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,989
My regards to Olga Yanovna.
I'll be waiting for you on Tuesday.

244
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,593
He likes everything he writes.
It's all because of his wifey.

245
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,757
She is his evil genius,
she is burning incense to him.

246
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,514
All right. I shall tell him.

247
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,754
Dear Alice, you just
dote on your Kostya.

248
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,272
You became sort of
his personal secretary.

249
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,749
You encourage these
ladies' hullabaloo.

250
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,993
Arkady Varlamovich,
but it is so simple!

251
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:12,196
The boy came to Moscow.
New acquaintances, new temptations.

252
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:17,753
Of course there appear women
who're too eager to chaperon him.

253
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,354
'Sing, sing, nightingales,
Spring, spring in the veins...'

254
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,991
No, he is questionable!
I wouldn't give him too much rope.

255
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,990
'War-loving viper
hisses and stings...'

256
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,591
Me and my auntie, we're pure
souls. You wouldn't understand.

257
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,830
A telephone number
of a mysterious lass.

258
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,992
Who can it be? I can't remember.

259
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,352
- Boo!
- Too many things on my mind.

260
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,909
I study at the History department,
moonlighting too -

261
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,516
an instructor at the athletics club.

262
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,191
Selling your body?

263
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,591
- Will you have something to eat?
- I wouldn't object to that, auntie.

264
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,356
Maybe I should get on the horn to her,
just for the kicks of it..

265
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,352
- Ah, no, let her relax.
- Tartuffe!

266
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,749
- Arkady Velyurov home?
- Home he is.

267
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,595
- You're what, his son?
- Honey, I'm his step-father.

268
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,910
I wouldn't buy that.

269
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,596
Well, this is my cross to bear.
Arkady Varlamovich, it's for you!

270
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,832
- Good afternoon.
- Jesus, what a surprise!

271
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,432
One moment, I'll just
put something on...

272
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,596
- Meanwhile, may I make a call?
- Absolutely, my dear Sveta!

273
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,675
So, you are Sveta. My stepson
is just crazy about you.

274
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,594
Your stepson? I'm not
some babe in the wood for you.

275
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,593
My name is Constantine,
which means 'constant'.

276
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,751
- My congratulations to your wife.
- I'm as lonely as Robinson Crusoe.

277
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,753
- The worse for you.
- I'm not as lucky as you are.

278
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,911
I've known him only for 3 days.

279
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,594
- So where did you meet him?
- At the swimming competitions.

280
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,115
Wow, Velyurov was swimming too?!

281
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,070
He was watching.
I came the second.

282
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,999
The 'Labour Reserves' Club?

283
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,191
- How do you know?
- Intuition.

284
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,830
- He calls you Mermaid.
- He sent me a wire.

285
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,514
- 'cause I have no telephone.
- What is in the wire?

286
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,832
- 'Pining away'. Great.
- Really?

287
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,999
You've made a good choice.

288
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,917
He is a man with a scope and...
I'm sorry.

289
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,833
Sveta, would you come in?

290
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,753
I can't. Have you got the tickets?

291
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,990
I've lost my head, really!

292
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,909
Show me the telegram.
I couldn't read the address.

293
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,196
- Why do you need it?
- I just need it.

294
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,590
- But why?
- I'll explain it to you later.

295
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,990
'All your life may go to pieces
Like a castle on the sand.

296
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,194
'You're pretty - for wrong kisses,
You're clever - just offhand...'

297
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,192
- Tomorrow at 7 p.m.
- Thanks.

298
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,079
- Shall we meet after the concert?
- Only if it is not too late.

299
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,831
Oh my naiad...

300
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,431
What did you tell her?

301
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,592
I was just entertaining her, while
you were putting on your trousers!

302
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,194
You can't have anything
in common with Sveta!

303
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,430
- How do you know?
- What?!

304
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,997
Yes? It's for you.

305
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,911
Yes. Who is speaking?
llya? What a surprise.

306
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,355
Yes, I know.

307
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,753
Ha, that's a pretty kettle of fish!

308
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,591
The stage was like
'home sweet home' to me,

309
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,196
and now it has turned
into a Golgotha!

310
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:22,194
But who is not drinking?
Tell me!

311
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,990
Enough of it.
You just spit into my soul!

312
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,829
- They care about you.
- Oh, I know what they're worth.

313
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,278
You must drop this bad habit.
It's a bit damp here.

314
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,671
Arkady Varlamovich, what
about wetting our whistles?

315
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,991
Mind, you said it.

316
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,193
Let's go.

317
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,752
This umbrella is such a maverick.

318
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,833
- You're like a child.
- But meanwhile...

319
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,000
I am 43 years old.

320
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,591
- And you lost your referral...
- Yes, it was so ridiculous.

321
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,352
I was afraid you wouldn't come.

322
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,193
- You mean you're so lonely?
- Well, you know...

323
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:13,514
'Oh bitter recollections, once again
you enter my desolate house...'

324
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,831
- Is it your verse?
- No, it's Camoens.

325
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,992
- He is dead already.
- God Almighty!

326
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,192
- He died in the 16th century.
- In the 16th century?

327
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:29,276
His is a very sad biography.
He was a soldier, he had lost his eye.

328
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,069
- Then he died a pauper...
- Oh my!

329
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,590
Jesus, you're such a tender heart...

330
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,351
Give me the way, please...

331
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,590
Ladies first...

332
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,514
Please, pass the fare...

333
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,990
Shucks, this umbrella again...

334
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,990
- What's the matter?
- I've hurt my finger.

335
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,589
- Your handkerchief is clean?
- Comparatively.

336
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,514
Then you'd better take mine.
We must bandage your finger.

337
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,592
- Please, sit down.
- Oh no, I don't need this.

338
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,992
- We must show respect to old people.
- Thank you, young lady.

339
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,829
- Lyuda, please, sit down.
- No, I can't, Lev Evghenievich.

340
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,992
- Please...
- But I can't.

341
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,191
Lyuda, but please.

342
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,436
Oh, how many books you have.
You must be a professor!

343
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:50,277
I work at the publishing house.
I edit foreign poetry.

344
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,751
Camo... Camoens...
The one that had lost his eye?

345
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,993
And Cervantes had lost his hand.

346
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,829
Oh stop it. This is too much!

347
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,594
We can't help it. It's life.

348
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,591
We are waiting for you!

349
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,514
Is this Savva Ignatievich?
Nina Andreevna.

350
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,591
Thanks.

351
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,350
Good evening, dear colleague.

352
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,197
- A little surprise.
- Come on in.

353
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,754
Savva, tell Khobotov
the Orloviches are here.

354
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,831
Javol, Margarita Pavlovna.

355
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,355
Your Savva is a pleasant guy.

356
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:46,833
He was an artist of metal work,
now he is an instructor.

357
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:55,275
How is he getting on with your ex?

358
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,355
He likes him very much.
You can't but like Khobotov.

359
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:08,995
And what does Lev Evghenievich
make of all this?

360
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,192
He gives Savva his dues, of course.

361
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,993
Oh, highly spiritual relations!

362
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,592
'A beggar seeking alms you are,
An outcast by all forsaken.

363
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:27,676
'So feeling sore your poor heart:
And bitter death would be a welcome.'

364
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,831
- Is this a Camoens too?
- No.

365
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,436
It's Francois Villon,
his poem 'Testament'.

366
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,594
- He died too?
- He was hanged or stabbed, whatever.

367
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:44,198
My! Do these things
happen to all poets?

368
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,590
Almost to all of them.

369
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,991
Look, Lev Evghenievich,
the Orloviches are here.

370
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,998
- So what?
- Don't be like that.

371
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,668
- I told you: I can't.
- She wants you to come.

372
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,752
- I am busy.
- She warned you in the morning.

373
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,275
I told 'no' in the morning.

374
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,989
- So you will not come?
- No.

375
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,509
- You'll upset Margarita Pavlovna.
- I am sorry.

376
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,908
For shame!

377
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:20,996
Thanks to you I understood
one shouldn't be afraid to live.

378
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,998
- There is nothing to be afraid of!
-...One shouldn't postpone things...

379
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,431
'We're buried in the pits and graves,
And not a chance the dead to raise...'

380
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,512
- It's Francois...
- No, it's Arthur Rimbaud.

381
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,592
He died in the 19th century: he was
very talented and very hapless.

382
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,194
- And he too?!
- He had had his foot amputated.

383
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,433
As if they did it on purpose!..

384
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,513
lndeed... I see your lips
are trembling.

385
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,195
- I could show you a polka dance.
- You can dance?

386
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:52,514
It's an old French folksong,
very naive.

387
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:58,516
'Rosamund, now
we have finished the war!

388
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:04,435
'Rosamund, I've nothing
to do anymore.

389
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,355
'Rosamund, my country
is waiting for me.

390
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,354
'So farewell, Rosamund,
I'm going back to my family!

391
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,832
'Hey, we shall don
the neckties now...'

392
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,752
- He is very original, isn't he.
- There is something primeval in him.

393
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,197
- What's going on?
- They imitate the French stars.

394
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,670
Oh yeah, it's very obliging.

395
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,992
- When will you come?
- I don't know, my angel.

396
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,192
Nights are full of surprises,
aren't they?

397
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:19,993
One day your Kostya will surprise you
to a very great extent.

398
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,672
Why don't you watch the film?
You high priest of the Muses.

399
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,673
I'm a high priest
of stand-up comedy!

400
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,829
- How wonderful!
- You liked it?

401
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,910
Somebody is knocking!

402
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:01,355
What does this all mean?
The Orloviches are waiting.

403
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,195
But in what way should it
concern me?

404
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,352
- Khobotov, don't be so petty!
- I have always hated them!

405
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:13,833
- You're in blinkers of prejudice!
- Excuse me, I'm having guests.

406
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:19,195
- Oh really? How many of them?
- It doesn't matter.

407
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,352
Velyurov told me smth about this.
She works in a kindergarten?

408
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,988
Your Velyurov is a gossiper.

409
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,749
Ah, there you are. You are having
a rendezvous here?

410
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,593
- Margo, stop it.
- What did she find in you?

411
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,514
With all your infantility you are
too cumbersome for a kindergarten.

412
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,592
She is a medical worker,
and I'm a grown-up person.

413
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,672
A grown-up person? You'll be
lost without me and Savva.

414
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,991
- I don't think so.
- You, 'enfant terrible'!

415
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,998
- No!
- Khobotov, keep your hair on!

416
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,750
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

417
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,993
- So, you are Raissa?
- Lyudmila.

418
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,430
I knew as well.

419
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,593
Well, Mildred dear,
I wanted to tell you...

420
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,194
- Her name is Lyudmila!
- Hush.

421
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,590
My name is Margarita Pavlovna,

422
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,912
not long ago I was his wife.

423
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,988
We stopped being man and woman,
but we're still one family.

424
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:24,435
That's why I take his life
close to my heart.

425
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,593
- Please!
- But that is not the point.

426
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,910
You see, Lev Evghenievich
is a bit of a character.

427
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,833
He just can't concentrate.

428
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,993
He had invited you, knowing very
well we'd have guests in the evening.

429
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,590
Of course, I shall leave now.

430
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,839
Lyudochka!

431
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,350
You're so absent-minded!

432
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,590
Good bye, Mildred!

433
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,999
Mildred! Ah, Lyudochka!

434
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:15,517
- This is outrageous!
- Khobotov, don't be ridiculous!

435
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,989
Why ridiculous?
Say, I fell in love with someone!

436
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,432
You can't fall in love, you,
a subconscious erotomaniac!

437
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:30,596
If you meet someone
to arouse my confidence,

438
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,514
someone to whom I could
entrust you, I'll be only happy.

439
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,353
Get up. Come on.

440
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,752
It's not polite to our guests.
Come on.

441
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,839
There is no need
for somebody to think

442
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,437
that our family undergoes some
petty cataclysms.

443
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,430
Ah, Leva!

444
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,990
All burins are different.

445
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,671
There is a chisel,
and there is an etching needle.

446
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,993
I must admit, there is
some ginger in him.

447
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,829
For relief work only
a graver is used.

448
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,673
- He's a real fanatic of his trade.
- Achtung!

449
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:06,833
I engraved the champion's names
on the cups!

450
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,597
Engraving other people's names
is an act of self-abnegation.

451
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,272
- Khobotov, it's decadence.
- It's life.

452
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,194
Some people win cups,

453
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:23,512
and others engrave their names.

454
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:28,834
I don't know nothing about self-
abnegation, but it's a very rough work.

455
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,833
It can be done with
an etching needle.

456
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,551
- A healthy approach to the subject!
- Sophistry's not for craftsmen.

457
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,193
- What about diggers in 'Hamlet'?
- They're simply hacks!

458
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,592
Great!

459
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,070
They threw one girl up the other day
and never caught her.

460
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,590
She's on a sick leave now.
Suspended from competitions.

461
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,831
The 'Labour Reserves' Club.

462
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,437
Svetlana is a professional swimmer,
she swims on her back nicely!

463
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,431
I have a real man
in my house at last.

464
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,194
My Savva is such a darling,
I am very happy.

465
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,193
A wonderful evening!
'twas so fascinating!

466
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,272
- I wanted to tell you...
- It's all right, I understand.

467
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,752
'twas so invigorating!
C'est magnifique!

468
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:48,595
But mind, the scraper is what
levels out the burr!..

469
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,991
- He is absolutely possessed!
- This makes him so charming.

470
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,193
I can tell you what it
all boils down to...

471
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,830
I can see, my dear colleague.
For God's sake!..

472
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,994
Lev Evghenievich, hold on.
I just admire your attitude.

473
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,193
- You rose to the occasion!
- What do you mean?

474
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,352
- Well, 'meine Freunde'!
- Au revoir!

475
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,592
- Auf Wiedersehen!
- Good bye. Au revoir!

476
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,832
- Auf Wiedergucken!
- Your humble servant...

477
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,194
Savva. Lev...

478
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:27,196
Highly spiritual relations!

479
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,751
Just all right,
for intelligent people!

480
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,351
I am so tired.

481
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,196
What was the idea of mounting
your hobby-horse?

482
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,829
Using burins in metal-work,
Margarita Pavlovna:

483
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,595
engraving is a very delicate matter.
Haste makes waste.

484
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,274
And you were such a wet blanket.

485
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,910
I'm sure that with that Mildred
you're more eloquent!

486
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:13,189
She's Lyudmila! And don't
mention her name in vain!

487
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:18,912
- Vouzette ridicule, mon ami.
- Don't mention her name in vain!

488
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,512
Darling, you should take
a course of injections.

489
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,191
Well, let's go to sleep.

490
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,672
- I can hardly stand on my feet.
- I'll just smoke a cigarette.

491
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:37,753
Savva, I'm in complete despair.

492
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,993
Lev Evghenievich, take it easy.
Everything will settle down.

493
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,193
We'll get married by spring,
we'll move to a new apartment.

494
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,999
You'll be your own master here,
you'll enjoy yourself!

495
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,192
Many a thing can happen
before spring.

496
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,989
You must understand her too.
Bringing girls here. She feels hurt.

497
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:00,991
I'm bringing no girls!
It's different, a delicate matter.

498
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,516
You can't imagine what I've gone
through during this evening.

499
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,830
It's awful!

500
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,992
Just calm down. You'll have
to be patient...

501
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,192
- It's life.
- I understand.

502
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:23,353
- It's nothing compared with war.
- I understand.

503
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,432
Savva Ignatievich!..

504
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:51,676
'Like a river you flow,
With a tender fairy-name,

505
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:58,194
'And your pavement transparent -
Like in water-ways.

506
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:05,595
'Ah, Arbat, my dear street,
You're my big destiny:

507
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:11,912
'Therein lies my grief
And my happy days.

508
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:18,354
'Ah, Arbat, my dear street.
You're my big destiny:

509
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,833
'Therein lies my grief
And my happy days.

510
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,996
'Passers-by walking you
Are simple-hearted legion.

511
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,199
'The staccato of steps,
It's a busy day...

512
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,518
'Ah, Arbat, my dear street,
You're my big religion.

513
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:53,594
With your pavements beneath,
Here so nice to stay...

514
00:46:54,600 --> 00:47:00,197
'Ah, Arbat, my dear street,
You're my big religion.

515
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:06,199
'With your pavements beneath,
Here so nice to stay...

516
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:15,189
'I'm obsessed with this love,
Pavements sing a dear song.

517
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,915
'Many streets that I knew
Were just foreign land.

518
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:28,514
'Ah, Arbat, dear Arbat:
This is where I belong.

519
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:34,195
'Walking you, walking you... -
You will never end.

520
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:40,993
'Ah, Arbat, dear Arbat:
This is where I belong.

521
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,991
'Walking you, walking you... -

522
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,834
'You will never end...'

523
00:47:55,600 --> 00:48:01,835
My dear aquarium enwrapped
in sleep. Yes...

524
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,590
'Hi, my audience, you at last!
Listen to my funny rhymes:

525
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,433
'How some characters of past
Came to live in modern times...

526
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:30,356
'Dame of Spades, a hapless lot,
Kicked the bucket on the spot.

527
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,080
'Poor lady couldn't wait:
Ambulance a bit too late...

528
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,515
'Romeo fancied: it would be good
To buy for Juliet some fast food.

529
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:44,195
'Each of them a cutlet ate... -
Poor Romeo and Juliet!

530
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:53,435
'My dear friend, don't knit your brow:
I'm a comedian, you know.

531
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:57,991
'Is it satire? Not so much.
But I admit - there is some touch.

532
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:02,990
'I'd like to mention therefore
A poet Nekrasov of the past:

533
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:08,832
'You needn't be a poet, bro,
But civil spirit is a must!..'

534
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:06,595
I have it, Margarita Pavlovna!
Here you are!

535
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,913
Happy New Year, Alice.

536
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,750
Happy New Year, Aziz.
May you be happy!

537
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,192
The hendecassylabic metre
of the poet Thaletes

538
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:57,830
is a complicated pentameter,

539
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,991
consisting of four trochees

540
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,195
and one dactyl,

541
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:09,194
which took the second place.

542
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:14,876
In classic prosody, namely

543
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,032
in the hendecassylabic metre

544
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,998
we meet a caesura, every time -

545
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,752
after an arsis in the third foot.

546
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,198
This prosody is quite adaptable
in Russian language too...

547
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,357
- Please, Nina Andreevna.
- Thank you.

548
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:48,437
'Like a ship all too eager
to neglect its rigging:

549
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:53,068
'Now its sails billowing,
then - its oars feathering...

550
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,595
'Likewise you: it's a double passion
that you seek...

551
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,912
'You lad, seeking love...'

552
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,670
- Jesus, I can't...
- '...Burning with passion...'

553
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:09,911
'You lad, seeking love,
Burning with passion.

554
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,913
'So do you, lass: bereft of love,
Shedding bitter tears,

555
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:20,514
'You accept someone's
Unwelcome caresses...'

556
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:27,993
'The snow whirling: a lovely scene!
The blue lights shimmering above:

557
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:33,593
'Skating-rink gives a 'ring-ring'...
And reminds me of school-time love.

558
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:40,196
'You're merging with lights, so near:
I'm calling and after you run...

559
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:47,753
'Hey, catch me, I can hear.
You're playing with me. What a fun!

560
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:53,596
'Hey, catch me, I can hear.
You're playing with me. What a fun!'

561
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,839
'Falling snow, and
falling in love...

562
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:06,913
Lev Evghenievich, poor thing!
Let me help you.

563
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,351
Get up, my poor darling.

564
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:17,196
- It's all my blame.
- No, I'm too clumsy.

565
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,989
No, you skate nicely!

566
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,991
Are you hurt that much?

567
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,749
I just remembered about
Bertrand Dufois.

568
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,753
- Who was he?
- A trouvere of things hedonic.

569
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,832
- What happened to him?
- He fell down and died.

570
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,592
How awful!

571
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,839
You should be administered
an anti-tetanus serum!

572
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,198
You, an educated person, you
can't see elementary things!

573
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,351
You saw what happened with
that trouver of yours?..

574
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,351
Ah, Kostya!

575
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,751
- What happened with you?
- Just hurt myself a bit.

576
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:57,198
- He made a turn and fell down.
- It's a usual thing.

577
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,352
Girls, go and skate a bit,
I'll sit and talk with Lev Evghenievich.

578
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:03,830
- You will not leave him?
- Of course not!

579
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,993
What the hell you are doing here?

580
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:12,512
Margarita didn't accept her,
so - I'm 'spinning' here.

581
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,351
In my age, living some
illusory life...

582
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,193
We go to the flicks,
the last seances.

583
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,352
We were at the operetta.
Now - at the skating rink...

584
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:25,990
We also were at a lecture. She was
so kind to take the challenge...

585
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:30,591
- So, she is a kind girl, isn't she?
- Very kind. And very emotional too.

586
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:34,389
I told her about Francois Villon -
she nearly sobbed for pity.

587
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,597
Wow, I guess he was stabbed or
hanged up or something like that.

588
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,998
He died under strange circumstances.

589
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,590
You will scare the girl

590
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,510
out of her wits, Lev Evghenievich.

591
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:53,756
What do you think: can I expect
that my love be reciprocated?

592
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,352
You? By Jove, of course!

593
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:01,069
You're the incarnate virtue!
Life is great, Lev Evghenievich!

594
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,750
Kostya, what shall I do now?
I fell in love with her!

595
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,198
You must mold your own life,
be a master of your destiny.

596
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,079
- It's she!
- Who?! Margarita Pavlovna?

597
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:38,195
No, it's she. Stay here,
I'll be back in a moment...

598
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,993
Lev Evghenievich! Poor thing,
he left you alone?

599
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,831
I was waiting for you.

600
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,594
Shall we go? I shall see you home.

601
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,355
- No, I love it being here.
- Oh really?

602
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,835
Yes, these lights,
this marvelous spinning.

603
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:19,593
You in this lovely sweater,
and this music...

604
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,752
And I loved that polka dance
so much!

605
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,990
I could hardly find you.

606
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,194
- Why're you looking for me?
- I was told to.

607
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,352
- Hi.
- Good evening.

608
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:53,069
The boy living next door said he
saw you here, on the Clear Pond.

609
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,748
What business did he have
telling on me!

610
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,277
He is just a kid, you can't blame him.
Margarita threw herself into a tantrum!

611
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,671
She asked me to bring you home.

612
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:05,593
For God's sake!
Savva, go home.

613
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,912
- Don't get into a huff.
- Yes, I'll see you home...

614
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,594
Either you leave now, or
everything is over between us!

615
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,830
Wow!

616
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,991
Lyuda, let's go on skating.

617
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,672
- Savva, you here too?
- Kostya...

618
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:28,514
- Where is Lev Evghenievich?
- He's skating.

619
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:33,674
Margarita can't find any peace
without him, and he's skating!

620
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:41,515
- What do they want from him?
- They care for his fragile life.

621
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,990
- The ice is slippery.
- You slip, you take a risk.

622
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,192
Right you are,
you've said a mouthful.

623
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,192
I've received yet another wire
from Velyurov.

624
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,431
He'll go bankrupt, really.

625
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,431
- Don't tease me.
- I'm being serious.

626
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:01,436
By the way, he is
a very nice person.

627
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:05,434
Oh yeah, all the war hawks
look at him with trepidation.

628
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,194
- What about you?
- I'm a person of free choice.

629
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:12,434
- And there he is, by the way.
- Wow! And he too!

630
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,351
He looks quite imposing!

631
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,832
I'll split. I don't want
to upset him without need.

632
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:23,751
God will reward you
for your kindness.

633
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,912
Why are you wandering here,
oh restless soul?

634
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:39,835
I feel so blue, I need
to get distracted.

635
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,833
- What depresses you so?
- You wouldn't understand.

636
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,676
- You're having a crisis?
- Like any artiste, I do.

637
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:50,832
You've just outgrown
stand-up comedy.

638
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,992
You can't play one and
the same role all your life.

639
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:58,432
An artiste must be in constant
search and don different clothes.

640
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:02,593
- Your dinner-jacket is not popular.
- I'm a master of the word!

641
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,990
No, a writer is.

642
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:09,593
I'm a reciter, a soloist,
a master of skits and lampoons!

643
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:13,355
You can't depend on Soev and
his spouse all your life.

644
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:17,513
- An artiste must change his outfit!
- You're so emphatically monosyllabic!

645
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,989
Well, it's up to you, Velyurov.

646
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,509
- You feel bad?
- Can you see...

647
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:27,431
- What? Whom?
- It's she!

648
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:30,512
- Who?
- Oh, what a beauty!

649
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:29,433
She disappeared.
A glimpse, a vision, a mirage...

650
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:33,830
A vision, a mirage...
It's in the spirit of the day.

651
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:38,592
But there is a hope I'll find her!

652
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,912
Lyuda, it's me.
I've good news for you!

653
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:03,197
Excuse me.
Lyuda, I've got good news!

654
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:07,432
They're getting married tomorrow!

657
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:19,672
No, nothing is wrong with my
breathing, no asthma!

658
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:23,435
I'm healthy! I'm happy!
I love you, Lyudochka!

659
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,670
I kiss you!

660
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:31,829
What's wrong with you?
Why're you wearing a fur-coat?

661
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:37,197
It's awfully cold. I'm awfully cold.

662
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,591
I'm cold...

'Flap your ears, hither come,
Hey, good people, listen!

683

'We'll give you a lot of fun,
We'll keep the tradition!

684

'Jesters with a funny face,
For the crowd to jeer:

685
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:21,349
'Circus now a marketplace,
You can buy things here!'

686
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:26,633
Well, I've bought everything.
Where is Arkady?

687
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:32,032
We shouldn't have entrusted
him with strong drinks.

688
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:35,636
Arkady, Margarita told us
not to be too long.

689
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,439
- Take it easy.
- Arkady, alles gemacht!

690
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:41,438
Funf Minuten', Savva Ignatievich.

'Many barkers in the town,
But the best one is a clown.

693

'Buy a ticket, Muscovite,
We're all too glad to sell!

694
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:01,629
'We the gates shall open wide,
We shall ring the bell!'

695
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:16,640
Once I met a woman
of extraordinary beauty.

696
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:20,873
For the one getting married these
are quite inappropriate recollections.

697
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,632
I've no ulterior motive.

698
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:26,873
He is turning over a leaf,
let him give vent to his feelings.

699
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:30,032
As bride's witness, you
didn't rise to the occasion.

700
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:33,192
You are a moralist,
and it is unbearable.

701
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:36,193
- Yep, I am a moralist!
- You are a Pharisee!

702
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:42,632
- Where were you last night?
- I had a simultaneous chess game.

703
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,791
A simultaneous love game maybe?

704
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:50,796
- I'm 10 min from being a grandmaster!
- You are already a master!

705
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,429
Oh, let us be going now.

706
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:57,111
Alice, it is for Kostya.

707
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:01,034
- Let them call a bit later.
- All right.

708
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,509
Would you call a bit later?

709
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:10,431
- Arkady, let's be going.
- Let go of me.

710
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:16,272
- Really, we must go now.
- I'm feeling blue like the poet Blok.

711
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,714
What?

712
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,189
- My naiad has disappeared.
- Don't panic.

713
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:22,715
I have showered her with telegrams.

714
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:26,429
Too bad. I could open your eyes
on a lot of things.

715
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:30,792
You should be more up-to-date,
keep in tune with reality.

716
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:35,192
- The end of the century is in the air.
- What do you mean?

717
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:38,272
You're calling her a naiad, speaking
about feeling blue like Blok.

718
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,273
- And you're three sheets in the wind.
- Kostya, don't be rude.

719
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:46,434
- A naiad! She is a swimmer!
- Call her Madama Butterfly.

720
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:50,269
There is such a swimming stroke,
a very progressive one.

721
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:53,034
- No kidding?
- Not at all, I know it.

722
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,430
I need to think about it. A cafe!
I'll catch up with you.

723
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:58,712
- We are going together now!
- Oh no!

724
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,952
Kostya? He'll be any minute now.

725
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:06,432
Yes, I'll put it down,
I'll just take a pencil.

726
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,351
Ah, here he is.

727
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:14,510
Yes? Oh, what a surprise!

728
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:18,349
Your boyfriend in the army now?..

729
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:21,637
Ah, I see. Right. Bye.

730
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:24,030
Compexes, complexes...

731
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:28,633
A butterfly!

732
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:33,032
- You're plastered!
- What a hail-fellow manner!

733
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:36,033
I know my limit all too well.

734
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:40,637
But as for you... I've been observing
you for quite a long time.

735
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:45,794
I remember how you talked with
Sveta and how you stared at her!

736
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:50,795
- What do you mean?
- You... you!..

737
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:54,271
You were craving her!

738
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:59,275
- What a cheek! It's slander!
- I know what' I'm talking about!

739
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:02,716
- You can blow the wedding!
- Nonsense!

740
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:08,033
- You're the bride's witness.
- I can control myself!

741
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:12,952
- Sveta has walked out on me!
- Look at your humble servant:

742
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:18,035
in a wink I met and then
lost a girl of my dream.

743
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:21,112
And what do you think? I passed
my exams yesterday, all right?

744
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,636
There is someone... Oh Jesus...

745
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,439
There is someone
between the two of us.

746
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:31,189
The young lot, especially the fair one,
are too undemanding nowadays.

747
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:35,433
But she was at my concert,
she witnessed my success!

748
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:38,438
You shouldn't bemoan it:
she fell short.

749
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,950
- You think so?
- She is a flippant girl.

750
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,395
The Festival of Youth is at hand.

751
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,630
There will come handsome guys
from New Zealand!..

752
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,872
If you let feelings take the most
of you, you would pine away!

753
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:52,713
- It makes sense.
- So, you are lucky then!

754
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:57,271
- After all, I'm Velyurov!
- Right you are.

755
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,795
- I'm Velyurov!
- Velyurov indeed!

756
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:03,032
- I'm Velyurov!
- You've said a mouthful!

757
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:06,111
Arkady Varlamovich, excuse me.

758
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,191
Anna Adamovna!

759
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:14,871
Hi.

760
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:18,192
- Why are you so late?
- I don't know myself.

761
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:24,873
- I'm having a wedding today.
- How come?

762
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,634
I'm the bridegroom's best man.

763
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:32,032
- Please meet the bridesmaid.
- How do you do.

764
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:36,635
Ah, I'm at a loss, you know.
I was thinking, thinking...

765
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:41,033
Shall I drop in or shall I not...

766
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:46,192
- I've dropped in just for a minute.
- Yes, of course.

767
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:48,430
The books are waiting for you.

768
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:53,638
I'm so absurd, you know,
so faltering.

769
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:58,030
So illogical!..

770
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,358
Yes? Yes?

771
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:14,188
- Hi.
- What is it, Margo?

772
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:16,874
- How is your side feeling?
- It hurts a bit.

773
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:21,352
- I'm sorry, it's such a mess here.
- It's all right. Are you alone?

774
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,717
Yes, though I can't understand
how it may concern you.

775
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:29,636
- And what about the skating rink?
- What about it?

776
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:33,031
You're very secretive. We've
been together for 15 years,

777
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:36,272
and it never occurred to me
you were a skating star!

778
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:39,632
People change, given
certain circumstances.

779
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,871
That injure will tell
on your appendix.

780
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:47,633
- You're going somewhere?
- Yes.

781
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:50,109
- Alone?
- It's none of your business.

782
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:56,276
It's not your self speaking,
it's your vacuum crying out!

783
01:09:56,440 --> 01:10:02,276
The vacuum which you strive
to fill artificially!

784
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:06,956
- You have no need of her!
- You are no judge!

785
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:11,033
I know better what you need.
I saw that small forehead of hers...

786
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,430
Would you be so kind
as to show some respect!

787
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:17,428
You just taking revenge on me!

788
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:21,792
Some silly commonplace,
a shame to any thinking man!

789
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:25,635
I'm not asking you whether you're
going alone to the wedding ceremony!

790
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,633
- You're suffering!
- I don't want your sympathy!

791
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,792
You must pay Savva his dues.
You know he's a virtuous man.

792
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:36,431
- Things prosper in his hands.
- Things burn down in yours!

793
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:41,634
I've been spoiling your life.
Now we're free, the two of us!

794
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:45,876
You think now you can
demonstrate your inclinations?

795
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,031
- What inclinations?
- I remember everything.

796
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,431
How you came home late,
which, being not too circumspect,

797
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:55,030
you explained by that usual
absentmindedness of yours!

798
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:58,431
- Or how you didn't come to dacha!
- I lost my key!

799
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:04,237
Or that harlot from the Scandinavian
office, with that sinful mouth of hers!

800
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:07,631
Excuse me, I can't proceed
back-talking like this!

801
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:12,874
- May you and Savva be happy.
- You must be back home at 3 p.m.

802
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:26,434
Darling, you're so excited!
This is a once-in-a-lifetime day!

803
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,790
May I remind you,
I was married before.

804
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:34,035
When you read all these books,

805
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:39,349
a truth will open up before you:
abstention,

806
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,268
abstention,

807
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,433
abstention!..

808
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:47,953
I don't know really.

809
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:53,350
I am so sudden,

810
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:57,431
so illogical...

811
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:04,190
Kostya! The taxi is here!

812
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:08,872
Margarita, Savva! Your wedding
'carriage' is at the doors!

813
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:15,430
- But where is your veil?
- Stop it, Kostya!

814
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:18,632
- Savva, you're magnificent!
- Well...

815
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:22,634
- And where is Arkady?
- Arkady, it's time to go!

816
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:28,279
Arkady Varlamovich.

817
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,870
- What does that mean?
- I'm just reclining.

818
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:33,634
- You must be crazy!
- I'm not feeling well.

819
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:37,031
- This is outrageous!
- Have you no sense of duty?

820
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:40,431
I have. But I can't.

821
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:44,635
- Arkady Varlamovich!
- No!

822
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:49,032
He can't stand witness: he'll turn
the wedding prayer into a farce!

823
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:53,029
- We're being late. What do we do?
- We need another witness.

824
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:58,791
Lev, Arkady is out of order.
You'll stand witness.

825
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:02,794
- But I can't!
- No way out. Hold on.

826
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:05,952
- Hold on, Levushka.
- Let Alice do this for you.

827
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:09,157
My dear friend, I'm cooking! I'm
the chef of the wedding table!

828
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:12,633
- Lev, help us out!
- We'll tell you what to do.

829
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:17,636
I'm having a date! We're going
to watch the frescoes!

830
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:21,952
- You must offer this sacrifice.
- We'll go in a taxi.

831
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:25,635
You're a knight without fear
and without reproach!

832
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:29,350
- We'll go in a taxi!
- Some Stone Age!

833
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,631
God's speed to you!..

834
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,632
It'll take just a moment, Lev.
Setzen Sie bitte.

835
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:41,635
- It's outrageous!
- Lev, don't be detrimental.

836
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:43,439
Svetlana!..

837
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,636
Svetlana!..

838
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:51,034
Hush, you shameless type!

839
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:02,112
Lev, everything will be all right.

840
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,440
What frescoes was he talking about?

841
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:11,269
Lev Evghenievich was going to visit
the Novodevichy Monastery.

842
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,793
It's crazy!

843
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:16,873
There's a fine touch: you getting
married, he going to the monastery!

844
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:37,271
Lev Evghenievich, look
who is sitting at the table...

845
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:41,115
- Poor thing, waiting for me there.
- Jesus, here you go again...

846
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:44,791
Savva, just take
a look at this girl.

847
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:48,794
- She is pretty!
- No, she is magnificent!

848
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,635
Savva Ignatievich is on quite
different business here.

849
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,109
Oh yes, I beg your pardon.

850
01:14:55,960 --> 01:15:00,715
Excuse me, do you haunt the skating
rink at the Clear Pond?

851
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,314
- Not too often, but I do.
- I saw you there, for sure.

852
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:07,439
- Kostya, for God's sake...
- One moment, Lev Evghenievich.

853
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:11,428
What do you feel for those going
through the wedding ceremony:

854
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:15,633
Resentment, sympathy, or maybe -
the motherly love?

855
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:19,270
When you're going to get married,
I'll tell you. Are you a reporter?

856
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:25,037
I'm a historian, but modern days
arouse my quick interest.

857
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:28,671
- What is your name?
- Rita.

858
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:31,115
- What?
- Margarita.

859
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:39,436
- You are the would-be husband?
- No, but I'm the potential one.

860
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:44,428
- So, it's you then?
- No, it's not me.

861
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:48,633
- Aren't you getting married?
- It's quite the other way round.

862
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,110
Savva, Ignatievich, will you
please step forward.

863
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,032
Ein Moment.

864
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:58,111
Margarita...

865
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:03,636
Margarita, do you take this man
Savva to be your husband?

866
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:05,438
Naturally.

867
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:09,030
Savva, do you take this woman
Margarita to be your wife?

868
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,792
Naturlich.

869
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:15,273
As a token of love and faithfulness -
exchange your rings.

870
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,191
Now kiss each other.

871
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:29,116
And put your signatures
here and here.

872
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:35,312
- Now - the witnesses.
- Excuse me, I'm in a hurry.

873
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:38,189
Khobotov!

874
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:41,636
Witness, are you a relative
of this newlywed woman?

875
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:45,634
Alas, from this moment on -
I am not, anymore.

876
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,791
Khobotov, I appreciated everything.

877
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:50,951
Your turn.

878
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,631
- You and me.
- What?

879
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,268
I mean, gimme your pen.

880
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:02,030
Konstantin Romin:
don't forget my name.

881
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:04,636
- I shall try to.
- Be sure and do this.

882
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:09,271
Konstantin in the ancient
language means 'constant'.

883
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:14,033
- Can I go now?
- Witness, have some patience.

884
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,794
Margarita Pavlovna and
Savva Ignatievich:

885
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:21,953
I pronounce you man and wife.

886
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:25,511
And my congratulations.

887
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,632
My congratulations.

888
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,950
Now the music, please...

889
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:46,432

Lev Evghenievich, for God's sake!

905
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:27,518
- He's feeling blue.
- Savva!

Didn't I ask you to be quiet,
while I'm working with the author!

907
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:32,269
I'm desperately sorry.

908
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:36,794
Soev, let's give it another try.

911
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:56,430
With all due respect for Mrs Soev,
but is that a finale?

912
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:59,438
- A brilliant finale!
- This - a finale?!.

913
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:01,631
'It means I shall make a U-turn...'

914
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:05,429
- A brilliant finale!
- It's your old variations!

915
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:08,279
You're not a Shakespeare to do this.

916
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:12,638
Shakespeare? You want me
to improvise? Very well...

Yes. it's me. Your boyfriend
still in the army?

But I am going away too, you know.

They've found an ancient city

I am going away for a very long time.
I'm crossing her out.

It's not funny, you know.

It doesn't matter now. I'm in
for a great change in my life.

929
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:06,634
It's you. Good afternoon.

930
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:12,192
- How did you like the film?
- A total lack of talent!

931
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:15,636
Dear auntie, art still
owes you a nice film.

932
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:21,951
Speaking of art...

933
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:31,794
Sveta Popova! It's for you.

934
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,871
- Hello?
- Hi.

935
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:38,635
- Is that you, Kostya?
- Yes.

936
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,792
- Something is wrong with you?
- Absolutely not.

937
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:44,633
- I'm going away.
- Where to?

938
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,951
The Black Earth region. They've found
the skull of the prophet Oleg's horsie.

939
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:52,272
- I read about this in the papers.
- You're such a smart girl.

940
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:57,195
By the by, Velyurov has prepared
an outstanding program!

941
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:01,433
He'll be the hit of the
World Festival of Youth.

942
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:05,269
Yes, he's my nice 'step-son'!

943
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,634
Bye, Sveta.

944
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:10,270
I wish you to win
all the gold medals!

945
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,431
He must be crazy...

946
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:20,629
We're in for great changes!

947
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:30,030
Well, Savva...

948
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:36,032
Check. Leonty, give a hand
to your fellow-in-arms.

949
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:39,792
- Lev, make your move.
- Yes, of course.

950
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:57,030
Hey, son, move your brains.

951
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:11,874
Once a lady came to me.

952
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:16,032
She wanted me to engrave
an inscription.

953
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:18,870
- On what?
- On the wrist-watch.

954
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:26,639
The inscription went like this:
'Thanks for the lovely seconds...'

955
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:34,433
A present to an artiste? No, she said.
To a writer? - No.

956
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:39,111
- To whom then?
- It was meant for her husband!

957
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:44,111
For you as a newlywed this
is a nice story to tell.

958
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:48,872
Savva, you promised to solder
a saucepan for me!

959
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:51,634
Naturlich, Margarita Pavlovna.

960
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:54,631
Check and mate, Savva!

961
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:03,274
You were a first-rate engraver!
I am totally positive of that.

962
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:07,877
We're going to the building site.
We'll be moving in any day now.

963
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:09,439
That's great!

964
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:22,634
My untiresome friend Savransky
knows some architect.

965
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:27,112
He says they're going
to dismantle our humble castle.

966
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,032
And where are we going then?

967
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:32,192
Take it easy, Lev, the government
will take care of you.

968
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:36,638
Oh yeah, you shaking dust from
your feet, leaving me here.

969
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,870
- It's not decided yet.
- What exactly?

970
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:43,113
Your acquaintance sometimes
becomes like a landmark.

971
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:47,193
You, Savva, incarnate
a historical process.

972
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:48,952
Which one?

973
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:53,033
A total Exodus of the Muscovites
from communal flats to private ones.

974
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:57,034
Wow, what eloquence!
We're moving out in a fortnight.

975
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:00,033
Lev Evghenievich, you're
losing the game.

976
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:03,279
Margarita Pavlovna, they
want Kostya on the horn.

977
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:10,275
Look, my dear friends, isn't
it time for you to break up?

978
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:11,509
Yes, of course.

979
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:15,633
- Kostya, the phone.
- In a jiffy.

980
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:19,634
Lev, it's a stalemate situation.
I offer you a tie.

981
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:25,633
Khobotov, what about working a bit?

982
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:28,030
Et si tu travaillais.

983
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:32,793
- A preface for the Orloviches.
- All right.

984
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:39,277
Khobotov! How is your side doing?

985
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,351
Aches a bit.

986
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:46,793
Appendix. It'll all come to this.

987
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:51,431
- Jesus, what fantasies!
- It's all because of your skating.

988
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:55,270
What my skating has
to do with all this?

989
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:56,953
Some champion!

990
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:05,635
Savva, can you put her to reason!

991
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:09,634
- Come on, Lev.
- Are you a husband or not?

992
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:12,792
You should've listened to me
when we were at the skating rink.

993
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,633
I'm asking you for the last time!

994
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:19,873
Only two weeks left,
have some patience, Lev.

995
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:31,194
Ah, Anna Adamovna... But I'm
going to Armenia on a business trip.

996
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:36,434
They've discovered on the Ararat
the wreck of the Noah Ark.

997
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:39,438
You know already?..
Jesus, how extraordinary!

998
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:43,349
You'll hear from me. Bye.
I'm crossing her out.

999
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:48,632
- Hi, Soev,
- Hi, Kostya.

1000
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,791
You've brought something new?

1001
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:54,430
- Yes, and my wife liked it.
- It speaks for itself.

1002
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:58,633
With all due respect for Mrs. Soev
and for her refined taste,

1003
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,189
please, what about the finale?

1004
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:04,511
Remember our last piece: so simple,
and with marvelous connotation?

1005
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:08,269
- And such a scope!
- One can't please you enough.

1006
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:12,956
The one taking the road gains smth.
Creative unrest is what you need.

1007
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:18,199
- Soev, he is one of the audience.
- No, he's one of your neighbors.

1008
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:23,434
But you are a poet,
a mouthpiece of the epoch!

1009
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:26,029
- I think you're exaggerating.
- But I'm not!

1010
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:29,272
You need creative endeavor.
You need a masterpiece!

1011
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:31,431
Why should he need any?

1012
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:34,438
You, an advocate of stale forms!

1013
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:37,632
- I beg your pardon!
- You must change your appearance!

1014
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:39,631
You have an idee fixe.

1015
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:42,792
Look, Soev. There is another
way of self-expression.

1016
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,633
Write a comedy in verse,
like Griboedov did.

1017
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:47,711
He had a tragic end.

1018
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:54,268
- You scare my authors away!
- The Soevs will be the end of you.

1019
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:56,351
But who will help me? You?

1020
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:00,115
Why not? I have a talent.

1021
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:05,796
Lev, I've trans-lated your polka
into Russian.

1022
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:08,030
- I can imagine.
- I'm serious.

1023
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,952
Stop it, Kostya.

1024
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:14,796
It's a song about
underprivileged youth.

1025
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:18,794
- Oh, leave me alone.
- First the lass recollects...

1026
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:22,635
'Ah, my Father looked askance
when he watched my polka dance.'

1027
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:27,874
Then the lad recollects: he
had the same sad experience...

1028
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:30,634
'Ah, my Father looked askance,
when he watched my polka dance.'

1029
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:31,789
'Magnificent'...

1030
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:34,793
And then he says to the girl:
come on, I know how it feels too...

1031
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:40,796
Kostya, can you tell me, what
Margarita wants from me?

1032
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:47,033
She wants you. It lies
in her subconscious.

1033
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:51,349
Thus bespeaks her attraction
to the universal harmony.

1034
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:56,953
- But this is impossible!
- Who knows.

1035
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:06,632
Lyudochka! You've come!

1036
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:10,350
- You're here!
- You're ill?

1037
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:14,195
I don't know. I'm feeling blue,
staying at home...

1038
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:16,954
My poor darling, do you want
me to make you some tea?

1039
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:19,031
- Hi, Lyudochka.
- Hi, Kostya.

1040
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:22,192
You heard the news?
Emile Zola died of fumes.

1041
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:26,273
- Oh no!
- Never forget to turn off the gas!

1042
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:29,029
Maybe you shall introduce me?

1043
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:33,273
- Oh yes: please meet Velyurov.
- A master of eloquence.

1044
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:37,433
Oh.
Kostya, where is Svetlana?

1045
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:40,518
- What Svetlana?
- She is a D.Sc.

1046
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:44,634
I'll tell you about her later.

1047
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:53,874
- A D.Sc?
- Yes, a D.Sc.

1048
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:01,635
Oh, it's you. Speak of the devil,
and here's the D.Sc.

1049
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:07,033
No, you can have the book for keeps.
I'm leaving.

1050
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,794
- Where?
- To look for Tamerlan's grave.

1051
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:15,876
And thank you. What for?
'For love pangs since the day we met.'

1052
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:22,637
What else?
'For bitter tears that I shed...'

1053
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:26,635
- Isn't it blasphemy!
- It's just his love of poetry!

1054
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:30,349
Thank you. I will
write you a letter.

1055
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:35,548
What is wrong with loving Lermontov!
Or you love some other authors?

1056
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:37,637
Bravo! What can you say to this?

1057
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:41,634
What is wrong with my being
in love like some silly calf?

1058
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:46,430
What is wrong with my old loves
forgotten and letters burnt down?

1059
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:50,633
- You can't love!
- No, he can!

1060
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:53,439
Merci, mon ange.
That was a challenge of an answer!

1061
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:56,510
Ha, you're in concert,
the two of you.

1062
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:02,032
Your aunt has encouraged
your corruption.

1063
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:07,194
You can't understand: my aunt
is a wonderful creature!

1064
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:09,635
She saw little turbulence
in her life.

1065
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:14,351
Fiction and loneliness - this is
all she had for herself.

1066
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:19,878
But my living here adds
turbulence to her life.

1067
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:24,033
- And she is grateful for this.
- Ah, how kind of you!..

1068
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:26,634
You don't sound sincere.

1069
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:03,870
It's not funny.

1070
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:09,030
I was always a sealed book for you.

1071
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:13,637
After your escapade on the wedding
day, it became clear that

1072
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:16,633
your complexity becomes you
as a pince-nez becomes Mr. Soev.

1073
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:21,636
- I have apologized, haven't I?
- Everyone rose to the occasion.

1074
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:25,236
And only you proved to be
everybody's antagonist.

1075
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:28,440
Judge not that you be not judged!

1076
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:33,634
Savransky nearly ran into a dump
truck when he learned about this!

1077
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:39,192
Yes? Rita! I'm coming!

1078
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:47,037
Think about your behavior and
send a wire to Sveta. She's waiting.

1079
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:12,632
- Hey, chick, wait!..
- What a beauty!

1080
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:19,636
'I love you, though I fret and frown,
God, what a helpless enterprise!

1081
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:23,634
'And what a folly! How unwise!
But at your feet I'm kneeling down.'

1082
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:27,359
We're going now to my parents.

1083
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:33,038
You must make a favorable
impression on them.

1084
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:35,430
I shall try my best...

1085
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:42,952
'I'm bored without you, I yawn,
With you I feel melancholy.

1086
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:47,636
'To tell you only this I long:
My angel, oh, how I love thee!

1087
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:51,634
'You cast a smile - oh radiance!
Away you go - my life ends.

1088
01:33:55,640 --> 01:34:00,350
'Alina, can I entertain
A hope, the sinner as I am,

1089
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:03,717
'For all transgressions and the pain,
Dost love you, angel, such a man?

1090
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:10,194
'Just feign you love, put on a mask,
Play with your mimicry a game.

1091
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:15,275
'A hope's a lie - but all the same.
Illusion - just for this I ask...'

1092
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:23,276
You will present this perfume,
'The Beau of Moscow' - to my mom.

1093
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:26,271
And here we are.

1094
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:31,431
This is a critical situation!

1095
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:35,439
Now the right forward has the ball.

1096
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:40,714
He runs it and sends it right
into the center! Now! A goal!

1097
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:46,033
A goal! Play, Yasha, play. A goal!

1098
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:49,637
- Savelyich?
- What?

1099
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:53,190
- What is the score?
- 3:2.

1100
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:57,633
Savransky, it's 3:2.

1101
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:02,431
Ladies, it's 3:2.

1102
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:09,428
The stands are crowded today.
Another attack! They send a ball!

1103
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:16,433
This duet of our forwards today
is just something!

1104
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:19,791
We can expect any kind
of surprises from them...

1105
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:26,271
Lev Evghenievich.

1106
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:35,189
- Good afternoon.
- Hi.

1107
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:38,352
- How are you feeling today?
- Fine.

1108
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:43,717
I would like you to go with us
and have a look at our apartment.

1109
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:46,633
- Today I can't.
- It's such a shame.

1110
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:52,954
- But it concerns you too.
- In what way?

1111
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:56,359
You're moving in with us.

1112
01:35:56,520 --> 01:36:00,513
Why? I have my own room here.

1113
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:06,273
The room can wait, and it would be
better if you live with us.

1114
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:09,520
Until you get married, of course.

1115
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:13,269
Excuse me, but it's nonsense!

1116
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:19,034
I talked with Savva,
he backs up my idea.

1117
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:23,429
Savva! What does this all mean?

1118
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:29,717
You'll be just within our reach,
it would be more expedient.

1119
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:34,071
And you will need your room

1120
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:37,869
when a woman shows up that
could inspire my confidence.

1121
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:45,198
Lyudochka!

1122
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:59,430
Margarita, Savva, please
meet my future wife.

1123
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:07,637
Khobotov... It's not serious.

1124
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:10,509
- I beg your pardon!
- I would better leave...

1125
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:13,188
We shall leave together now!

1126
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:18,639
You're not being decent
towards this girl.

1127
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,351
I'm not decent?

1128
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:27,631
I'm not decent?

1129
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,472
So why say such a thing!

1130
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:35,435
Being a complete egoist,

1131
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:40,634
you want this girl to bear
the unbearable burden!

1132
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:46,194
Dear, do you want all your life
go wrong,

1133
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:48,351
turn into chaos,

1134
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:54,117
with things vanishing: bills,
money, stockings, neckties...

1135
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:58,637
With all electrical appliances
blowing up,

1136
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:01,030
taking fire, breaking down!

1137
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:05,272
With your life going
back to the lce Age,

1138
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:12,274
but with no skins to make you warm,
because he won't get you no skins!

1139
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:15,637
Stop it! It's all true,
I must live alone.

1140
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:20,635
Believe me, dear, I'm not
prejudiced against him.

1141
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:24,795
He is a flamboyant personality,
and women are attracted to him.

1142
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:29,715
But I wouldn't mention here his
abnormal attraction to them.

1143
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:32,633
He sends a sparkle seeing
every other woman living!

1144
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:36,270
My whole life was
poisoned by the worst

1145
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:39,955
and, alas, not unfounded suspicions!

1146
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:43,192
Did he read verse to you,
spin the mist of citations?

1147
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:45,351
Stop it! I said, it's all true!

1148
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:49,035
So, this precious
thing here is mine!

1149
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:52,192
He is my cross! And I will bear it!

1150
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:55,352
You will meet another man:
more 'fresh', and more well-knit.

1151
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:59,513
- But...
- No, Savva! She's right.

1152
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:22,951
Forgive me, Lyudochka.

1153
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:26,631
And farewell.

1154
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:31,431
You... you're renouncing me?

1155
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:39,714
I have to.
I will ruin your life.

1156
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:51,791
It's all over.

1157
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:12,351
It's all over...

1158
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:16,711
It's all over.

1159
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:26,119
Take it.

1160
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:43,639
For the first time ever you
behaved like a grown-up person.

1161
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:49,433
- Maybe.
- You'll be grateful to me for this.

1162
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:59,273
'The murderer his dagger thrust,

1163
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:02,034
'And, dying, poor De la Rue

1164
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:07,876
Took off his hat, and said at last

1165
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:12,031
Most gallantly: "Thank you..."'

1166
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:19,870
What have you done?..

1167
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:26,633
- What have I done!..
- Lev, don't be so pathetic.

1168
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:31,794
It was like some hypnosis.
It's unbelievable!

1169
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:34,870
With my own hands...

1170
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:40,269
to give away happiness, hope...

1171
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:44,433
To reject one's own
renaissance in life...

1172
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:48,633
And all this, for fear
of some specters!

1173
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:51,792
You behave like a child
left without his sweets.

1174
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:54,633
- Release me!
- You psycho.

1175
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:59,032
- I love her!
- Nonsense! Self-hypnosis!

1176
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:01,873
- I love her!
- You, sexual maniac!

1177
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:04,270
Savva, take a look at this baboon!

1178
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:06,271
Hold on, Lev.

1179
01:42:06,440 --> 01:42:12,276
All my life I was thinking
with your head.

1180
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:16,274
Now I want to be allowed
to decide for myself!

1181
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:19,432
- It's so banal, Khobotov.
- So what!

1182
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:23,349
lndependent intellects
never shunned banality!

1183
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:28,958
- It's not about you!
- Yes, right you are!

1184
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:35,275
With you out of my way I could
have become a Dostoevsky!

1185
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:37,112
A Schopenhauer!

1186
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:42,638
But instead I became a petty
scribbler, a walking volume!

1187
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:46,873
All my life dawdling over
other people's prefaces!

1188
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:49,508
Without me you would have become
everybody's punching bag!

1189
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:52,359
A scapegoat!

1190
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:57,036
So what! But I would
have lived! Yes!

1191
01:42:57,200 --> 01:42:58,189
Lev, zip your lip!

1192
01:42:58,360 --> 01:43:03,354
All my life constraining myself,
fearing fools and scoundrels!

1193
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:06,876
Half-living, half-working,

1194
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:11,511
knowing neither ups, nor downs.
Do you call this life?

1195
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:15,269
- You ungrateful epileptic!
- I'm getting married!

1196
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:19,558
They don't registrate nut cases!

1197
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,432
You'll live and see!

1198
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:25,428
I feel bad. I've a stitch in my side.
My head is spinning...

1199
01:43:25,640 --> 01:43:29,076
- Well, we must act!
- What are you going to do?

1200
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:32,437
I'm calling Doctor Vera!

1201
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:34,631
- I voice my protest!
- Don't panic.

1202
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:39,353
- Speaking!
- It's me, Margarita!

1203
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:42,512
- I don't have any pain!
- You will!

1204
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:48,429
- Alice!
- Why are you shouting like that!

1205
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:52,269
Alice, they're going to butcher me!

1206
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:53,555
You're kidding!

1207
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:58,880
I'm bringing Khobotov now.
His appendix acts funny.

1208
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:03,511
What the heck! We should amputate it,
to avoid peritonitis!

1209
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:06,712
- A progressive attitude!
- You heard it?

1210
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:10,031
You're quite right, we should
do away with this useless tube!

1211
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:12,430
- It's cruel!
- Hold on, Lev.

1212
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:17,637
Arkady, go and hail a taxi.
Khobotov is going to the hospital!

1213
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:20,792
- What's the matter?
- It's a life-or-death matter!

1214
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:26,876
- Or you're not in shape again?
- You needn't remind me!

1215
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:33,355
Lev, get dressed! Savva,
get his toothbrush!

1216
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:37,635
Hey! Stop!

1217
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:40,188
Stop!

1218
01:44:45,640 --> 01:44:47,631
- I'm not going anywhere!
- Don't offer resistance!

1219
01:44:48,040 --> 01:44:51,635
- It's violence!
- Don't let me down!

1220
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:54,268
A D.Sc. is waiting for us
in the emergency room!

1221
01:44:55,120 --> 01:44:58,112
I'm coming!

1222
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:04,512
I got it! I was nearly
run down by an ambulance!

1223
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:07,518
No, I'm not going anywhere.

1224
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:10,280
Please. Hey, give me a hand.

1225
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:21,634
My temperature is all right.

1226
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:25,031
The better for you. The operation
will go off smoothly.

1227
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:28,556
Though you must admit your state
is far from being cool.

1228
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:31,951
Hi.

1229
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:35,111
It's some nightmare...

1230
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:50,953
'So here I am, before all of ye,
A serious and funny guy.

1231
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:56,877
'I make no bones of telling ye:
Who, how & what & when & why...

1232
01:45:57,040 --> 01:46:02,637
'Hey, stop the war, keep saying we.
Thus humor is a remedy...

1233
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:08,113
'So on this warm and summer day
A monologue I'd like to say...

1234
01:46:23,640 --> 01:46:30,637
'All nature is green and blue
And so bright - Look!

1235
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:37,036
'The spring creeks are purling
And sing every day.

1236
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:45,034
'All life is like river
Goes on by the Spring Book.

1237
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:52,276
'Love enters your heart,
You can't send it away.

1238
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:55,193
'Don't send it away...

1239
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:05,036
'Love keeping you warm,
It will not let you go.

1240
01:47:06,640 --> 01:47:12,033
'A nightingale giving
a poignant key.

1241
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:21,637
'Love's company - sadness,
It keeps you sad. So

1242
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:29,636
'It's better to love
Than feel melancholy...'

1243
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:07,034
Lyudochka! Lyudochka!

1244
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:12,638
I knew it, I believed
that you would come!

1245
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:24,431
- Please, eat some.
- I'm not hungry.

1246
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:30,434
- The pajama looks baggy on you...
- It's just too big for me.

1247
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:52,272
Lyudochka, when they...

1248
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:56,433
...when they brought me after
the operation, they dropped me!

1249
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:58,951
I just knew it!

1250
01:48:59,120 --> 01:49:02,635
Lyudochka, I suffered a lot!

1251
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:07,271
I was lying on that table,
naked and helpless...

1252
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:11,032
They could do to me
whatever they wanted.

1253
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:16,349
- Hi.
- Hi.

1254
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:20,200
They'd never do anything wrong.

1255
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:24,433
- Why are you so sure?
- 'cause I'm a medical worker myself.

1256
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:29,430
I've been here for a week,
but you wouldn't come...

1257
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:32,279
- But I didn't know!
- Yes, of course...

1258
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:36,638
- It's all my fault.
- If it were not for Kostya...

1259
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:42,875
Jesus, you're such a pure soul!

1260
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:03,031
- Why don't you eat?
- I don't feel like eating.

1261
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:09,435
'O Lord, what is my destiny:
My poor feet are failing me...'

1262
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:11,631
Did you tell the doctor about this?

1263
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:15,873
This is a poem by a French
poetess, which she wrote

1264
01:50:16,040 --> 01:50:19,874
when she had a baby in her womb.

1265
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:25,956
'What's waiting for my poor baby:
Pitch darkness I'm now in maybe.

1266
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:29,351
'So many things that I abhor:

1267
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:33,433
'Can't drink, can't eat,
Sweet dreams not anymore...'

1268
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:38,350
It happens. Pregnancy has
different effect on women.

1269
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:42,035
Once a lady came to us,
she was in the family way.

1270
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:45,510
lmagine: she was sick whenever
she saw her own husband!

1271
01:50:46,640 --> 01:50:48,631
My darling!

1272
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:55,637
My advice: unless you're betrothed,
don't ever kiss!

1273
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:58,633
- Getting well?
- Oh, thank you, Kostya!

1274
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:03,032
-You gave the whole world back to me!
- Oh, you're welcome!

1275
01:51:03,200 --> 01:51:04,633
Girls, please meet each other.

1276
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:07,030
Kostya told me a lot about you.

1277
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:11,432
- Oh yeah, he is a talkative guy.
- My every word is a second thought!

1278
01:51:11,640 --> 01:51:12,789
- Lev Evghenievich.
- Oh yes.

1279
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:14,632
- Khobotov.
- Margarita.

1280
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:17,633
- What?!
- Rita.

1281
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:25,115
Lev Evghenievich, we didn't come
alone. We have an escort.

1282
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:28,636
- There is Savransky over there.
- Let him join us!

1283
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:31,439
He can't leave his wheeled 'friend'.

1284
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:34,552
Savransky, don't go away,
you may come in useful today!

1285
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:39,436
Wow, what people come by!

1286
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:47,718
'I told my date: let's meet again,
Because I love your pretty face.

1287
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:53,352
'She gave a smile, and even blushed
and said: Oh yes, yes, yes!..'

1288
01:51:54,720 --> 01:51:57,359
Hi, everybody!

1289
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:01,518
How are you? It's me!

1290
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:07,431
- Is it all right that I came now?
- Of course!

1291
01:52:07,640 --> 01:52:09,039
It's for you.

1292
01:52:09,200 --> 01:52:12,272
You emanate triumph. Who you took
prisoner at your Austerlitz?

1293
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:15,637
- Svetlana came to my concert.
- Don't make the same mistake.

1294
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:17,358
Never teach fish to swim!

1295
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:22,435
'Next day I shaved, put on a tie,
The dandy one with a polka dot.

1296
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:27,031
'I bought three asters
And turned my step to our spot...'

1297
01:52:28,040 --> 01:52:32,352
It's a shame you don't burr.
It would make you more charming.

1298
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:35,432
- I can do without it.
- And you should change your name.

1299
01:52:35,640 --> 01:52:38,200
Mr. Velyurov... Velour is fabric...
Make it Mr. Valour.

1300
01:52:38,360 --> 01:52:40,271
I like 'my' name!..

1301
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:45,116
'And so we came: me - to the drugstore
Me - in cafe, in any case!

1302
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:49,432
'Let's meet again then.
Same time, same place...'

1303
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:53,956
I was never at the hospital: I was
at a spa. It was no picnic either.

1304
01:52:54,120 --> 01:52:58,636
The worst thing there were old women.
A discouraging spectacle!

1305
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:02,714
- What were you doing there?
- They were probing me...

1306
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:05,428
- Looked for you, babe.
- And me too.

1307
01:53:05,640 --> 01:53:07,949
- I was mad!
- I began to cry!

1308
01:53:08,120 --> 01:53:11,032
- You didn't come!
- Where were you?

1309
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:13,430
- So I left!
- And so did I!

1310
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:15,631
'And so we came:

1311
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:19,190
' - Me - to the drugstore.
Me - in cafe, in any case!

1312
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:23,519
'Let's meet again then.
Same time,

1313
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:25,278
'Same place!..'

1314
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:31,029
Lev! I am so glad!

1315
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:33,871
Thank you.

1316
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:37,476
- I'm so glad to see you!
- Me too.

1317
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:42,477
Yes, I am glad to see you,
Arkady, though...

1318
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:47,874
It hurts me to think
that you took part

1319
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:51,231
in that act of violence...

1320
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:55,871
I... I just wanted to help you.

1321
01:53:56,640 --> 01:53:59,871
Yeah, they literally
dragged you here.

1322
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:06,878
Please don't. Let us
not speak about sad things.

1323
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:10,033
Lev Evghenievich,
I learned that polka dance!

1324
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:15,034
Mon papa ne veut pas...
Kostya, join in!

1325
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:18,192
'When he watched my polka dance...

1326
01:54:18,360 --> 01:54:23,036
- Mon papa ne veut pas.
- When he watched my polka dance.

1327
01:54:23,480 --> 01:54:27,951
- Mon papa ne veut pas.
- Que je danse, que je danse.

1328
01:54:28,120 --> 01:54:31,874
- Mon papa ne veut pas.
- Que je danse la polka.

1329
01:54:32,040 --> 01:54:33,951
Rita, join in!..

1330
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:36,714
I feel so bashful in her presence:
I even lose my tongue.

1331
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:40,475
- Ah, my father looked askance.
- When he watched my polka dance.

1332
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:44,076
- And my father looked askance.
- When he watched my polka dance!

1333
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:04,190
- I'd better leave.
- No, you mustn't.

1334
01:55:04,360 --> 01:55:10,037
Girls, let's hide and watch
how the events unfold!

1335
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:13,636
Lev Evghenievich, it's time
to make your choice!

1336
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:16,872
You must fight for your rights
of a man and a human!

1337
01:55:20,120 --> 01:55:23,874
You look better today.

1338
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:26,554
Hi, Arkady, you look magnificent.

1339
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:32,798
- More life in your gaze.
- I feel I am all right.

1340
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:34,871
Thanks God.

1341
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:41,798
- How is your new apartment?
- It's all too good to be true.

1342
01:55:41,960 --> 01:55:47,478
It's so spacious! You can
swing a cat there!

1343
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:51,792
There is some work to be done,
of course: the floors and so on.

1344
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:56,636
Every morning I take my drill and...
Lev will like it there.

1345
01:55:56,800 --> 01:56:00,475
- Never mind that.
- But you will be living there!

1346
01:56:02,120 --> 01:56:05,795
Are you starting again?

1347
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:09,714
The doctor said we can
take you home now.

1348
01:56:11,480 --> 01:56:14,472
What do you mean 'take' me?

1349
01:56:15,560 --> 01:56:20,270
Make all the papers ready
and get down to the vestibule.

1350
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:22,869
Savva, grab a cab and come here.

1351
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:26,191
- Right!
- I protest!

1352
01:56:26,360 --> 01:56:32,196
Khobotov, calm down.
It's temporary, but necessary.

1353
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:37,798
I feel responsible to a woman
that will come one day and

1354
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:43,114
to whom I shall entrust you, sound
and healthy and in your right mind.

1355
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:46,191
Lev, collect your things.

1356
01:56:58,640 --> 01:57:02,474
- Savva, tell me...
- Lev Evghenievich, come on...

1357
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:07,111
Savva dear, please tell me...

1358
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:10,114
Will ever there be
an end to all this?

1359
01:57:11,200 --> 01:57:14,192
Why don't you answer me?

1360
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:19,555
- Shame on you!
- What do you mean?

1361
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:23,031
I will tell you frankly.

1362
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:30,272
You're an outstanding man!
I look up to you!

1363
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:35,795
You have such a clever head,

1364
01:57:35,960 --> 01:57:38,554
all these things that you know.

1365
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:42,554
But sometimes you embarrass me.

1366
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:45,359
- But...
- Don't interrupt me.

1367
01:57:47,480 --> 01:57:49,710
You make me feel sore, really.

1368
01:57:49,880 --> 01:57:52,474
You've such a brilliant head,

1369
01:57:52,640 --> 01:57:57,111
and with this head of yours
you can't understand obvious things!

1370
01:57:58,280 --> 01:58:02,353
You're such a lucky person!
A great woman is caring for you.

1371
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:06,269
You can live in clover.
What else do you want?

1372
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:09,472
You ought to be thankful
and do what you're told to.

1373
01:58:09,640 --> 01:58:13,394
You had a rest, under anesthesia,

1374
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:18,276
but Margarita and I could hardly
have a wink of a sleep!

1375
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:21,951
Tut, tut, Savva.

1376
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:26,953
I thought that this hospital
here will bring you to reason.

1377
01:58:27,120 --> 01:58:30,954
And you're starting all this again.
Shame on you.

1378
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:34,278
Can you tell me...

1379
01:58:36,040 --> 01:58:40,875
Why do you want me
to live in your house?

1380
01:58:42,720 --> 01:58:45,951
What do you personally need me for?

1381
01:58:47,720 --> 01:58:54,034
Ha, you speak foreign languages,
and you can't understand Russian?

1382
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:58,873
It matters not what we would do
but what we should do.

1383
01:59:00,040 --> 01:59:04,113
You just won't be able to
pull through without us.

1384
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:08,476
Why did you hammer it
into your head

1385
01:59:09,480 --> 01:59:12,472
that I will not pull
through without you?!

1386
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:20,477
Ask Arkady. Well, it's time.
We're taking you from here.

1387
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:25,952
It will be the end of me.

1388
01:59:27,120 --> 01:59:28,792
It's the end.

1389
01:59:30,120 --> 01:59:32,873
And what if he is right?

1390
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:38,190
Overemotional people

1391
01:59:38,360 --> 01:59:42,273
need someone else to lead them.

1392
01:59:43,720 --> 01:59:46,280
What are you saying?

1393
01:59:46,480 --> 01:59:50,473
What on earth are you saying?

1394
01:59:51,200 --> 01:59:52,713
Kostya!

1395
01:59:53,480 --> 01:59:55,471
Kostya! Kostya!

1396
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:07,108
It's the endspiel stage of the game
now! And I'm going to play it!

1397
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:10,869
Savransky!

1398
02:00:15,640 --> 02:00:18,950
At last - your moment
of glory has come!

1399
02:00:19,120 --> 02:00:22,635
If they take me away,
this will be the end of me!

1400
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:25,792
- Don't panic.
- I know what I'm talking about!

1401
02:00:25,960 --> 02:00:29,270
If they take me, there
will be no escape - ever!

1402
02:00:30,120 --> 02:00:33,874
We must elope! Now!

1403
02:00:34,040 --> 02:00:36,031
- In this pajama, you can't.
- Everything has been provided for!

1404
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:39,272
Velyurov takes your rags, and
you're putting on his apparel!

1405
02:00:39,480 --> 02:00:40,879
What?!

1406
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:43,031
- But the patients!
- They will not tell on you.

1407
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:44,792
It's like a big
fellowship with them.

1408
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:46,871
- I'm ready!
- And what about you?

1409
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:50,112
This is some crazy farce!

1410
02:00:50,280 --> 02:00:55,274
Yes, it's a farce, a vaudeville,
a tragic comedy!

1411
02:00:55,480 --> 02:00:58,631
It's all genres together, by heck!

1412
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:02,270
Are you an artiste or some
bath-house attendant?

1413
02:01:02,480 --> 02:01:06,109
I'm disappointed! Where is your
zest for putting on masks?

1414
02:01:06,280 --> 02:01:08,794
- Again?..
- What do you mean - 'again'?

1415
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:12,270
You've been deluding the audience
during all these 20 years!

1416
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:14,869
I didn't say 'no'!

1417
02:01:15,040 --> 02:01:19,477
Then hit the bushes! It's
a decisive moment for all of you!

1418
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:25,873
I'm doing this only out of
my sympathy for Khobotov!

1419
02:01:33,200 --> 02:01:37,637
My mom is right. You're just a kid!

1420
02:01:40,120 --> 02:01:44,477
Take it easy! Youth is
a fleeting moment!

1421
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:50,190
In no time at all I will change!

1422
02:01:50,360 --> 02:01:52,874
And not for the better!

1423
02:01:53,120 --> 02:01:56,192
I will second-guess things!

1424
02:01:57,480 --> 02:02:00,790
I will know measure in everything!

1425
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:06,475
- Oh no.
- Don't disappoint us.

1426
02:02:06,880 --> 02:02:09,269
Yes, we're still young now!

1427
02:02:09,640 --> 02:02:13,269
I look like some cheap
rogue in this suit!

1428
02:02:13,480 --> 02:02:16,950
Hey, it's my Sunday clothes!

1429
02:02:17,120 --> 02:02:20,112
I wouldn't be too fastidious
in your place, you flannel guy.

1430
02:02:20,280 --> 02:02:21,633
They're coming!

1431
02:02:31,960 --> 02:02:34,633
Arkady Varlamovich,
it's your act now!

1432
02:02:35,480 --> 02:02:39,268
Absolute transformation!
Break your leg!

1433
02:02:39,480 --> 02:02:41,118
Oh yeah...

1434
02:02:42,720 --> 02:02:46,713
Khobotov, what do you mean?
I was waiting for you in the lobby!

1435
02:02:46,880 --> 02:02:49,030
- The taxi is here.
- Very well.

1436
02:02:49,960 --> 02:02:53,475
- What does that mean?
- It's complete 'alles kaputt!

1437
02:02:53,640 --> 02:02:57,349
A story to make one's blood freeze!

1438
02:02:57,560 --> 02:03:01,269
He was a lion disguised as a lamb!

1439
02:03:01,480 --> 02:03:04,790
I just came to visit him:

1440
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:08,111
He dragged me into a thicket,

1441
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:13,957
tore off my clothes and
made himself scarce!

1442
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:18,030
'O! that this too solid flesh
would melt,

1443
02:03:18,200 --> 02:03:23,274
'Thaw, and resolve
itself into a dew!'

1444
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:27,792
- What're you babbling about?
- Hey, it's 'Hamlet!'

1445
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:32,109
I had to put on his rags

1446
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:35,875
to cover my nudeness!

1447
02:03:36,040 --> 02:03:39,874
'Why, let the strucken deer go weep,

1448
02:03:40,040 --> 02:03:43,271
'The hart ungalled play;

1449
02:03:43,880 --> 02:03:47,111
'For some must watch, while some
must sleep:

1450
02:03:47,480 --> 02:03:51,871
'So runs the world away!'

1451
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,991
So, you're so jubilant, eh?

1452
02:04:03,120 --> 02:04:07,033
Of course, you're quite right!

1453
02:04:07,880 --> 02:04:12,635
You doomed him to sure death!

1454
02:04:13,720 --> 02:04:16,280
Way to go, fellows.

1455
02:04:17,040 --> 02:04:21,272
Yes, I'm an evil genius,
and you're benefactors?

1456
02:04:21,800 --> 02:04:25,634
You wish him good, I wish him evil?

1457
02:04:27,960 --> 02:04:32,112
I want to tell you, Kostya.

1458
02:04:33,720 --> 02:04:37,269
Not to Velyurov, he was
just an instrument!

1459
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:40,635
- Me? An instrument?!
- Shut up.

1460
02:04:41,560 --> 02:04:46,270
Kostya, you're too young.

1461
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:50,110
And you can't understand
a lot of things.

1462
02:04:51,400 --> 02:04:55,632
Yes, I'm young. I've been already
reproached for this today.

1463
02:04:58,640 --> 02:05:02,633
But believe a historian:

1464
02:05:03,800 --> 02:05:09,636
you can't make one happy
against his own free will.

1465
02:05:10,280 --> 02:05:16,276
Stop it, we shall live and see,
in, say, 25 years.

1466
02:05:18,480 --> 02:05:25,113
- Where were you?
- Doing what you told me to.

1467
02:05:25,280 --> 02:05:27,874
- You fool!
- I was looking for a cab!

1468
02:05:28,040 --> 02:05:30,270
- Where is it?
- It's waiting.

1469
02:05:30,480 --> 02:05:32,710
Hurry up, we must
catch up with him.

1470
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:38,712
To catch Savransky
is wishful thinking.

1471
02:06:32,640 --> 02:06:33,959
Lyudochka!

1472
02:06:34,120 --> 02:06:35,951
Stop!

1473
02:06:37,320 --> 02:06:38,355
Lyudochka!

1474
02:06:55,720 --> 02:06:57,631
Farewell!

1475
02:07:38,200 --> 02:07:43,115
Moscow, the 50s... They've turned
around the corner and disappeared...

1476
02:07:47,480 --> 02:07:51,712
The 60s quieted down, the 70s
fluttered away.

1477
02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:54,869
The 80s have sprouted.

1478
02:07:59,480 --> 02:08:05,112
We both, Moscow and I, change:
she is getting younger, me - older...

1479
02:08:06,120 --> 02:08:11,956
Where are you, friends of my youth?
My open-hearted girlfriends?..

1480
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:18,196
Oh youth, did you ever exist?
And where hath you gone?..

1481
02:08:18,600 --> 02:08:23,469
Only the wind in Neskuchny Garden
sweeping up your traces...
