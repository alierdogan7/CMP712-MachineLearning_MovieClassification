1
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,200
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,600
here is tonight's
extra special attraction.

3
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,600
That ridin', ropin'fool,

4
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,800
your western pal and mine,
Bronco Bob Mitchell.

5
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,400
"Bunko" Bob Mitchell!

6
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,400
That phony's never been
west of the Hudson River.

7
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,400
How about all those books he wrote?

8
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,200
I Fought Cattle Rustlers.
I Caught Horse Thieves.

9
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,000
I caught him where it hurts.
Read my column today.

10
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If it's true, it'll be the biggest
scoop of the year. Sure it's true.

11
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,800
I'm making book at 10-to-1 Bronco Bob
doesn't show up tonight or any night.

12
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,800
Bob, you've never been on a horse in
your life. I'll bet the horse knows it.

13
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,600
Forget the riding. Walk out
there and sing 'em a song.

14
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,800
I'll tell 'em
you've got a broken neck.

15
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,400
Pete, you saw what Martin
Manning wrote in his column. Yeah.

16
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,400
Do you want my public to
think he's right? He is right!

17
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,800
I admit starting all this Bronco
Bob buildup to sell your books but...

18
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,200
Mr. Mitchell, you're
on. But can he stay on?

19
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,600
Not that side, the other
side. Even I know that.

20
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,200
Anne, you should be gettin'
ready for the contest.

21
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,600
And miss a chance
to hear Bronco Bob sing?

22
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
That $10,000 will
wait a few minutes.

23
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,000
Give me my saddle

24
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,600
And let me ride

25
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,400
The painted hills
I love

26
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Where I can speak
with passing stars

27
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:41,600
And touch
the moon above

28
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,200
Give me my saddle

29
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,600
And let me go

30
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,000
Up where
the rivers start

31
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,800
Where I can let
a western breeze

32
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,800
Go singing
through my heart

33
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,600
They must have used
a magic brush

34
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,400
To paint the West
so fair

35
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,800
I know it must be
just a step

36
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Up to heaven
from there

37
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,200
So give me my saddle

38
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,600
And while I live

39
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,200
I only want to ride

40
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,600
The purple hills
and have my love

41
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,000
A-ridin' by my side

42
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,000
So give me my saddle

43
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,000
And while I live

44
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,600
I only want to ride

45
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,200
The purple hills
and have my love

46
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:29,400
A- ridin'
by my side

47
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,600
A-ridin' by

48
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:41,600
My side

49
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,200
Come on, boy.

50
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,000
Giddyup, faster. Come
on, giddyup!

51
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Giddyup, giddyup.

52
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,400
Hey, Willoughby, get off that
horse before the boss catches you.

53
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,400
Look out, Duke.
I'll run over you.

54
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Get off that horse, I'm
warnin' you. I'm playin' cowboy.

55
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,400
You know what the boss told you. What?

56
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,800
The next time he catches you
playing cowboy he's gonna fire you.

57
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yeah? Come on, help me sell this stuff.

58
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,200
Duke, did you see me? I was standing
next to a real, live jackass.

59
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
Did you ever ride a jackass? No.

60
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,000
You oughta get on to
yourself. Come on. Peanuts!

61
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,000
I get it. You think I'm a dummy?

62
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Hot dogs, red hot!

63
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,400
Hot dogs!
Hot... dog!

64
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,200
Did you ever ride a jackass? No.

65
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,200
Jump on my back.
No.

66
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,400
Manning, did my boy convince you he's
the real thing? So he can ride a horse.

67
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,200
That doesn't prove he's the great
western hero his books say he is.

68
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,200
Won't anything
ever convince you?

69
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,000
I'll make you a little...
Excuse me. I'll have a hot dog.

70
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,800
Hot dogs!
Don't push!

71
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,600
Peanuts! Hot dogs! Get 'em
while the manager's hot.

72
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,200
Boy, five peanuts.
Boy, five peanuts.

73
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,800
Five peanuts, right?
Here you are.

74
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Here's one, two, three,
four and a half, five.

75
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The man wants five bags
of peanuts. Oh, five bags.

76
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,600
What a business I'm doin'!
One, two, three, four, five.

77
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,800
50 cents. Right. Here it is.

78
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,000
Peanuts, popcorn.

79
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,800
Hey, Duke. Come here. What's the matter?

80
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,600
The guy threw 50 cents
and... Well, look for it.

81
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,400
What's the matter?
Bashful.

82
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,400
What happened? Where
did it go? Down the back.

83
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,400
Don't look.

84
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,800
Wait a minute. Get her to
stand up. Maybe it'll fall out.

85
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Get her to stand up? Sure.

86
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,800
I beg your pardon, madam. Do you
mind? Could I get you a better seat?

87
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,000
No, thank you.
I'm very comfortable.

88
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,200
Besides, I paid
a dollar for this seat.

89
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,200
You just got 50 cents change.

90
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,200
Come here.
What?

91
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,600
I'll get her to stand up. You
get the coin when it drops south.

92
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,600
Okay.
Go ahead, go ahead.

93
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
You don't have to stand up.

94
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm going downstairs.

95
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,800
Hey, did you get it?

96
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,400
I missed it by a foot. It
went down her shoe. What?

97
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,400
I beg your pardon. Are
you comfortable? Yes, I am.

98
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,800
If you want to make yourself feel
at home, you can take your shoes off.

99
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,600
Listen, if you don't
hotfoot it away from here,

100
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,000
I'll call an officer.

101
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,200
- Hey, hotfoot.
- Hotfoot?

102
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,600
Hey, I told you to peddle
those peanuts. Now get goin'!

103
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,200
I said get goin'!
Okay, boss.

104
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
I hope those vendors
weren't annoying you.

105
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,400
They are persistent salesmen.

106
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
They may be persistent,
but they're not salesmen.

107
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,000
Look out for the manager. I'd
like to give him a hotfoot too.

108
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Those fellows burn me up.

109
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Did you get it?

110
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Hiya, partner.

111
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,800
There he goes.
He just went...

112
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,800
Don't push.
I'm not pushing.

113
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Don't talk so loud. We don't want
to go out till we know we're clear.

114
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,200
Don't push. Get over! I'm not pushing.

115
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,400
Will you get over?
Get over yourself.

116
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,600
Hey, Duke. Quiet. What?

117
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,200
Where did you pick up the
fur coat? What fur coat?

118
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,200
Oh, it's a pretty... It's a pretty...

119
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,800
Another five minutes of you signing
autographs, I'd have had a nervous breakdown.

120
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,800
No, Miss Anne!

121
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,400
Miss Anne.

122
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,600
Are you all right? I'm all right.

123
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,200
Nice piece of bulldoggin',
miss. Get him out.

124
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,800
Are you hurt,
Miss Anne?

125
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,200
I'm okay, Joe.
Okay.

126
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,000
You sure you're not hurt?
It's just my leg, Ruby.

127
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
Mean ol' bull.
I'm terribly sorry.

128
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,400
So you're Bronco Bob,
the pride of the West.

129
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,200
You certainly looked it. Any real
rider could have sat his horse...

130
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,200
and bulldogged that steer himself.

131
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,800
Get out of here
before somebody comes.

132
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
This young lady may be hurt.
You want to lose that contract?

133
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,600
Tell him to get out of here. If
this gets out, he'll be ruined.

134
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,800
Go on, Mr. Mitchell. I wouldn't
dream of hurting your career.

135
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,200
Come on, beat it, will ya? Ruby.

136
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,800
Miss Anne! Miss Anne! Let's
get her into first aid.

137
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,400
We're sorry you got hurt. It's our fault.

138
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
Duke and I were running
to hide from the boss...

139
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,000
and I let the cow's husband
out. He means the bull.

140
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,000
Bull, nothin'.
It's a fact.

141
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,000
That's all right, boys.
It wasn't done intentionally.

142
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,200
Tell one of the attendants to
bring up a stretcher. Yes, sir.

143
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,000
She'll be all right. I'll phone
the hospital and make arrangements.

144
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,000
Hospital?
Hospital?

145
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,800
I've gotta ride in the finals
tonight. Out of the question, miss.

146
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,600
That may be only a sprain, but
I'll have to x-ray to be sure.

147
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,600
The next event, ladies and gentlemen,

148
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,200
the finals of the women's
trick-riding contest,

149
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,200
America's greatest cowgirls
risking life and limb...

150
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,000
for that grand prize of $10,000.

151
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Can I come in?

152
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Hiding from your public?

153
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,200
No, and thanks to you
I still have one.

154
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,600
I wanted to tell you how
sorry I am that you got hurt.

155
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,200
Any girl would gladly sacrifice her life
to save the great Bronco Bob Mitchell.

156
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,000
Everybody tells me that you'd have
been a cinch to win that $10,000 prize.

157
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,200
You'd make me feel better
if you'd accept this check.

158
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,200
I wasn't sure about the spelling of
the name, so I made it out like that.

159
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,000
What's the matter? Afraid that I'll
tell someone you're a four-flusher?

160
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,600
I wouldn't dream of disillusioning
your public, Mr. Bronco Bob Mitchell.

161
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,200
Now, take your check
and get out of here.

162
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,200
Did I just give the works
to that Martin Manning!

163
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,800
I made him admit you operated
that horse like it was a kiddy car.

164
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,800
How 'bout the girl?
She'll be all right.

165
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,200
You fixed everything?
Yeah, I fixed everything.

166
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,800
That's kind of a tough break for
her. Her old man runs a dude ranch.

167
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,000
It meant a lot of customers
if she'd won this championship.

168
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Dude ranch? Where? Who cares where?

169
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,400
You're going to Connecticut
and start that new story.

170
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,600
I'm gonna finish this one first.

171
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,400
Come on, let's get out of here.

172
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,200
That boy's worried. What
makes you think he's worried?

173
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,000
I don't know. He must be. Why?

174
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,600
He just threw away a check
for $10,000. Ain't I unlucky.

175
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,200
It wasn't made out to me.

176
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,400
Who was it made out to?
Some guy named "cash. "

177
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,600
- Why, you...
- Hey, you fellas.

178
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,200
The boss!
Come on!

179
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Let's hide in this dark tunnel.

180
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,600
Quiet! Don't let them
know we're up here.

181
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,800
What do you mean?
They know I'm here.

182
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,200
You!

183
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,800
This goes too.

184
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,400
Let's load the next one.

185
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,200
Hey, boys, you...

186
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,400
Anybody in there?

187
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,000
Nobody but us cows.
Thanks.

188
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Wait!

189
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,800
What's the idea?

190
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,200
Hey, it's a cow!

191
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,600
Hey, what are you guys doing?

192
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,200
We wanna talk to you!
Come here!

193
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,800
They don't seem to be around here.

194
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,400
Well, they went this way.

195
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,600
Hey, Duke.
What?

196
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,000
Look, a train whistle.
Where?

197
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,400
Right here.

198
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,000
Hey!
What the heck!

199
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,600
No, this way.
Come on.

200
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,000
There they go!

201
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,200
All right, boys, let's get movin'. Okay.

202
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,200
Oh, boy.
Can I help you?

203
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,400
Thanks, pal.
Don't mention it.

204
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,200
Wait a minute!

205
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,200
Come on, get on.
Okay.

206
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,400
Quiet.

207
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,000
Who put out the lights? Here, here.

208
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,600
That was a narrow
escape. You're telling me.

209
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,400
You think we ditched 'em?
Look out the back and find out.

210
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,000
Why don't you? Look out the back door!

211
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,000
Why do you make me do
these things? Go ahead.

212
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,400
Okay. Go ahead. What are you afraid of?

213
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,800
Huh?
Nope.

214
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,800
I think we ditched 'em. Swell.

215
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,400
Boy, that was a narrow escape.

216
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,400
What's the matter? What
happened? Hey, Duke!

217
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,400
Don't get excited.
We've been shanghaied.

218
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
Shanghaied?

219
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,800
What are you doin'
with that red flag?

220
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,800
Some dummy left it hangin'
up outside. Get rid of it.

221
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,400
What are you playin'?
A little game of poker.

222
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,400
Poker? That's the
one game I never played.

223
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,800
I don't know a thing about this game.
I'm so ignorant when it comes to cards.

224
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,000
Never played a game of poker? Nope.

225
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,400
Is this anything like dice? Well, uh, yes.

226
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,200
Sit down.
I'll teach you the game.

227
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,800
I wanna learn.
He's gonna teach me.

228
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
Sure, a friendly little game.

229
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,800
First man I find cheatin',
I'll shoot his hat off. Sure.

230
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
How many chips do you want? Chips?

231
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,400
You gotta buy chips.
How much do I buy?

232
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,000
How much money have you got? I got some.

233
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,400
What's the matter?

234
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,400
What are you so happy
about? I was tickling myself.

235
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,600
That's enough. There you are. No tax?

236
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,200
I'll deal.

237
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,600
Where's your ante?
I beg your pardon?

238
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,600
Where's your ante?
She's home with my uncle.

239
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,200
I didn't know he knew about
my relatives. No, no, no.

240
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,600
Feed the kitty. Here, pussy. Here, pussy.

241
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,600
Get me some milk, please.
No, no. Put up like this.

242
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,800
I told you I didn't know anything
about poker. Did you open?

243
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,400
I'll stay. What'll you
do? Either raise or call.

244
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,000
Call who? The man that made the bet.

245
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,000
Hey, you! No, no, no.
Put a dollar in the pot.

246
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,600
Oh, silly game.

247
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
The pot on the table. On the table?

248
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
Certainly.

249
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,600
Will you take that off! What
are you doing? You told me to!

250
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,400
Hey, you, ante up.
Ante up!

251
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,000
Who you yellin' at? You!

252
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,200
Do I get in these messes.

253
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,400
Excuse me, please.
Sit down.

254
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,000
I didn't know how big you was.

255
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,400
If you was a small guy, I
might've said something. Shh.

256
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,600
Look at the size of that
guy! Mmm-mmm-mmm. Keep quiet.

No, thanks.

299
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,400
Well, how are you? Good
as new and twice as fresh.

300
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,400
Sorry I couldn't bring home
that prize money.

301
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,200
What happened? It's a long story. Let's go.

302
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,600
I thought it was
a short story. Hello.

303
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,600
Oh, Mr. Mitchell.

304
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,800
Careful your train doesn't
go off and leave you.

305
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,600
Are you Mr. Mitchell?
Bronco Bob? That's right.

306
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,400
I'm glad to see ya. I got
your wire about reservations.

307
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
Proud to have you as a
guest. Thank you, sir.

308
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,200
A guest?
At the Lazy "S"?

309
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,600
When I told the boys,
they were mighty pleased.

310
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,600
They're countin' on pickin'
up a few pointers from ya.

311
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,600
Alabam, here she is.

312
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,000
Alabam, how are you?
Swell, now that you're back.

313
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,800
This place seems like
a desert without you around.

314
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,400
Mr. Mitchell, you must meet
Alabam Brewster, our foreman,

315
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,800
and the best rider
in this part of the country.

316
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,800
How are you, Mr.
Mitchell? Glad to know you.

317
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,000
He's terrific at bulldogging.

318
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,400
You two should have
a lot in common.

319
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,800
Let's go. See you at the ranch.

320
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,800
Welcome home, Miss Anne. Thank you.

321
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,800
The stock's just pullin' in.

322
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,800
I'll give the boys a hand
and be right along. All right.

323
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,600
You did all right. I could
have done better if...

324
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,600
Duke, real Indians!
We'll be attacked!

325
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,000
Put the freight cars in
a circle! Never mind, boy.

326
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,400
Send the pony express. I
sell souvenirs. Souvenirs.

327
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,800
He sells souvenirs.
Step over to my shop.

328
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,200
I sell Indian springwater. With every
bottle, I give away a bow and arrow.

329
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,800
How do you like that? All my
life I wanted a bow and arrow.

330
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,200
I wish I had one now.
I'd knock off a lot of Ind...

331
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,200
You want to get us in
trouble with these Indians?

332
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,200
Shush. Don't be scared of any Indians.

333
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,400
You show me one Indian,
I'll show you a coward.

334
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,600
I'm an Indian.
I'm a coward.

335
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,000
Step this way, gentlemen. What's
the matter with you? Come on.

336
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,400
Unravel the freight cars. It's
safe. Everything's all right.

337
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,600
Look, a real, genuine
Indian bow and arrow.

338
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,600
"Made in Cleveland. " Didn't you
ever hear of the Cleveland Indians?

339
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,800
Now stop!
Here, gentlemen.

340
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,600
It'll make you feel good,
like rain in the face.

341
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,800
That's what we need.
We could use some.

342
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,800
Buy a jug. That's all you do,
put your hand in your pocket.

343
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,800
You never come up with nothin'. Buy a jug!

344
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,800
What am I, the treasurer and
everything else? Go ahead.

345
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,200
Very refreshing, huh?
Oh, yeah.

346
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,200
What in the world is this?

347
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,200
Where'd he go?
Over that way.

348
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,400
Oh, boy. That's a fine
trick you played on me.

349
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,600
I'll call it even if you'll tell me
what those people are talkin' about.

350
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,800
My tribe are saying the
man who shoots an arrow...

351
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
through the tent of an
eligible squaw must marry her.

352
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,400
I think it's a very good law.

353
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,400
That law should be
all over the country.

354
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,800
You marry her. I don't wanna mar...

355
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,000
You gotta marry her. Not me.

356
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,600
You shot an arrow through
the heart of her tepee.

357
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,200
Therefore, you must marry her.

358
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,600
I'll see ya later.

359
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,800
Come along! I don't wanna marry her.

360
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,800
I'm not gonna marry
no girl.

361
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,200
She might be beautiful. I don't
care. I'm not gonna marry her.

362
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,600
I wouldn't marry the most
beautiful girl in the world.

363
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,600
I can be wrong.

364
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Hello.

365
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,800
I'm some marksman. I shot
my arrow through your tent.

366
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,200
No, I'm Sunbeam. Your
arrow pierced the tent...

367
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,600
of my sister, Moonbeam. Moonbeam? Sunbeam?

368
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,800
Hey, Duke,
must be twins.

369
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,800
Find out.
I think I will.

370
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Moonbeam!

371
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Yes, sweetheart?

372
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,200
Will there ever be an end to
that? She called me sweetheart.

373
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,000
Don't worry, little sister.

374
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,400
We'll have a
bow-and-arrow wedding.

375
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,400
A-tisket
a-tasket

376
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,200
A brown and
yellow basket

377
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,200
I send a letter
to my mommy

378
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,200
On the way
I dropped it

379
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,600
I dropped it
I dropped it

380
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,400
Yes, on the way
I dropped it

381
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,200
A little girlie
picked it up

382
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,800
And put it
in her pocket

383
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
She was truckin' on down
the avenue

384
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,400
With not a
single thing to do

385
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,600
She went a beg, beg, beggin'
all around

386
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,200
When she spied it
on the ground

387
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,800
She took it
She took it

388
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,800
My little
yellow basket

389
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,400
And if she doesn't
bring it back

390
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,800
I think
that I will die

391
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,600
Oh, gee

392
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,400
I wonder where
my basket can be

393
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,600
So do we, So do we
So do we

394
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,600
So do we
So do we

395
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,200
Oh, dear

396
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,800
I wish that little girl
I could see

397
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,200
So do we, So do we
So do we, So do we

398
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,600
So do we!
So do we!

399
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,400
Oh, why was I so careless
with that basket of mine

400
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:57,400
That itty-bitty basket
was a joy of mine

401
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,400
A-tisket
a-tasket

402
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,800
I lost
my yellow basket

403
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Won't someone help me
find my basket

404
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,400
And make me happy again
again

405
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,400
- Was it red?
- No, no, no, no

406
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,000
- Was it green?
- No, no, no, no

407
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,200
- Was it cerise?
- No, no, no!

408
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,400
Just a little
yellow basket

409
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,600
A little yellow basket

410
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,800
What are you doing here? Somebody has to
look after you. This idea of yours is crazy.

411
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,800
Hey, boys.

412
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,800
You lookin' for me?

413
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,800
We're tryin' to find out where we
are. You're at the Lazy "S" Ranch.

414
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,600
Are you lookin' for work? Not if
I can find anything else to do.

415
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,600
Could you use
a couple of good men?

416
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,200
Did you ever punch cattle?

417
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,200
I should say not.
I never hit animals.

418
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,000
He's only kidding. That
boy is a son of the West.

419
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
Oh, really? Reared on the prairie.

420
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,400
He had a saddle
for a cradle.

421
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,800
The moos of the cattle was
his lullaby. That's right!

422
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,600
Sure. Every time I hear moos I go to sleep.

423
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,400
You boys certainly have
a good sense of humor.

424
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,200
Hop over to the bunkhouse and get some
work clothes. I'll be in the office.

425
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,200
Thanks a lot.

426
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,400
We've got a job.
What are you waiting for?

427
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,200
Duke, I didn't know cowboys lived
in nice houses like this. Sure.

428
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,400
Look at the big
bathtub they got!

429
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,000
Never mind the tub.
Look at the girls in it!

430
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Oh, girls!

431
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,600
Woo!

432
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,600
How do you do? I'm Dotty
Davis, the ranch hostess.

433
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,200
Are you gentlemen taken
care of? Everything's dandy.

434
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,400
If I can do anything,
just whistle.

435
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,400
Let's grab ourselves a swim. Yeah.

436
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,400
Over here's bathing suits. Come on.

437
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,600
Did you take a shower?
Is there one missing?

438
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,400
Get your suit wet! Oh, get my suit wet.

439
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,200
Here you are.
What's that?

440
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,600
I got it wet. No! Dive in!

441
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,400
Get in the pool. Take
advantage of it. Okay.

442
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,200
How deep is it?
Up to my neck.

443
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,000
Okay, here I come.

444
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,800
Take it easy, kid.
I got ya.

445
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,600
Take it easy, girls.
I got ya.

446
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,600
Did I save ya?
Did I save ya?

447
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,400
I saved the three...

448
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,600
Are you the guy that told
me it was up to my neck?

449
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,800
Yeah. What are you
gonna do about it?

450
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,800
Why...

451
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,600
You ever find the guy
that stole that shower?

452
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,600
Listen, these people
are all watching you.

453
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,800
Go up to that springboard.
They're expecting an exhibition.

454
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,200
Go ahead. He'll be
right up there, folks.

455
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,400
All right, folks.

456
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,400
Get up on the board and show
the folks how you can dive.

457
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,800
Go on. Don't push. I'm gonna get up.

458
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,800
Well, get up. I mean, after all...

459
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,800
Go ahead, get up.
Go out on the board.

460
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,200
Go ahead.
Champion.

461
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:22,200
Go ahead, Willoughby.
The folks are waiting.

462
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,200
Get up on the board. Wait a
minute! That's enough for me.

463
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,200
Stand still! Get up... Ooo!

464
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Ooo, my head!
Hey, Duke, my head!

465
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,400
Never mind your head.

466
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,400
Hey, Duke!

467
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,200
Get off my fingers!

468
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,600
Get me off here, will ya?

469
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,400
You wanna break
that diving board?

470
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,600
Get me off, will ya?

471
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,000
Willoughby, get up!

472
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,800
What's the matter with you?

473
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,800
Is those pigeons divin' off of me?

474
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,600
Duke! Duke!

475
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,800
What are you all standing
around for? He can't swim!

476
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,800
Willoughby!
Get him out of there.

477
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Willoughby,
this is Duke talking.

478
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,800
We'll get him.

479
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,800
Come on, Willoughby.

480
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,800
Hey, Duke!
Are you all right?

481
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,800
Hey, Duke! Duke!
Come on, yes, yes.

482
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,400
I saw octopuses,
all kinds of fishes.

483
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,200
Why didn't you come up?
Nobody told me I had to.

484
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,400
Did I save all those lives? No.

485
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,000
Are them lives I saved? You're all right.

486
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
Oh, boy! Willoughby! There he goes again!

487
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,200
Hi, Jack!

488
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,200
How are you?
Welcome home, Miss Anne.

489
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,200
Thank you. What can we do for you?

490
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,400
I hear you got Bronco Bob
Mitchell stayin' at your place.

491
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,600
That's right. What about it?
The boys'd like to meet him.

492
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,200
Maybe I can arrange it.

493
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,200
Oh, Mr. Mitchell!
Here he comes.

494
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,400
Well, Bronco Bob himself.
Right proud to meet you.

495
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,400
Howdy, Bronco. How do you do?

496
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,600
Me and the boys rode out
to thank you personal-like.

497
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,000
Thank me? Sure, for entering our rodeo,

498
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,800
big event of
the Frontier Days Celebration.

499
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,200
We're turning the receipts
over to a hospital for kids.

500
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,000
Having a celebrity like you
ought to double our take.

501
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,200
Did you enter in a rodeo? He sure did.

502
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,800
Got this telegram a few hours ago.

503
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,400
"My old friend,
Bronco Bob Mitchell,

504
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,400
wishes me to announce his entry
in the broncobusting event...

505
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,800
of your Frontier Days Rodeo.

506
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,800
Signed, Martin Manning."

507
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,000
Good ol' Manning,
always ahead of the news.

508
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,800
It's all on the level?

509
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
We can count on you? Bob, wait. You...

510
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,200
It makes a difference in the
dough we take in for that hospital.

511
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,200
All right, boys,
you can count on me.

512
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,800
Swell, thanks.
Thanks a lot.

513
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,400
So long. See you later, Anne.

514
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:14,200
Broncobusting! You're beginning
to believe your own publicity.

515
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,200
So, you entered the rodeo and
decided to represent the Lazy "S."

516
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,600
Now isn't that wonderful! The fact
that it's going to keep our outfit...

517
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,800
from winning the team prize
doesn't matter.

518
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,400
I don't like myself as a phony any
more than you do. Then why be one?

519
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,000
All my life
I've tried to be a writer,

520
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,600
and all I got was a trunk
full of rejection slips...

521
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,200
until one day I happened
to write a western story.

522
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,400
I wrote more westerns and they
clicked too and that was the beginning.

523
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,800
This Bronco Bob buildup
was my publisher's idea.

524
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Well, why keep it up?

525
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,400
I can't tell the truth now. There
are too many people involved.

526
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,600
There are Bronco Bob toys,
souvenirs, all the rest.

527
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,400
A couple hundred people
make a living...

528
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,600
out of a guy that doesn't even exist.

529
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,800
I never realized that.

530
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,800
The only reason I came out here is
because I had some sort of a crazy idea...

531
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,800
that Bob Mitchell might learn to do some
things that Bronco Bob is supposed to do...

532
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,000
ifhe had the right
teacher. You mean Alabam?

533
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I mean you.
Mr. Mitchell?

534
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,800
As long as you're
gonna be on our team,

535
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,600
I thought you'd like to pick
the horse you wanna ride.

536
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:26,400
Uh, right now? We wanna
be sure you get the best.

537
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
Don't we, honey?

538
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,600
Come along, Bronco.

539
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,000
Oh, bury me not

540
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,600
On the lone... prairie

541
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,800
Where the flyin' fishes

542
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,400
Duke, look! Hey, what are you...

543
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,800
Here, you can have it. What are you doing?

544
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Why don't you look
where you're shooting?

545
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,000
I guess I'm not inquisitive.
You don't know what you're doing!

546
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,200
Hey, Duke.
What?

547
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,200
Please don't be mad at me. Why shouldn't I?

548
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,400
Without you,
I don't know what I'd do.

549
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,000
Please, look at me. Don't
point that gun at me!

550
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,200
I'm sorry. Going around
with a gun in your hand.

551
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,000
I'll fix you. Hold that bullet. Yes, sir.

552
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,400
There you are. Hold these
bullets. Hold the bullets!

553
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:17,400
Put that gun away...
and keep away from me!

554
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,600
Hey, Duke, I swallowed the bullet.

555
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,000
It's my own fault anyway.

556
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,200
I'm always gettin' you
into trouble.

557
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,600
I don't know why.

558
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,000
I deserve a good kick in the pants!

559
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,800
Hey, Duke.

560
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,200
Shh, shh!

561
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,200
Hey.

562
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,800
Put that down.
What's the matter with you?

563
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,600
There, take your pick.

564
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:54,400
Maybe you better not ride today.
There's no time like the present.

565
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,000
Pick that tame-looking one.

566
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,400
I'll take that one right there.

567
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,800
Say, you do know your horseflesh.

568
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,400
That's Wildcat, the toughest
piece of bronco I ever roped.

569
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,000
Wildcat!

570
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,800
If he tries to get on a horse
again, he's got a lot of nerve.

571
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,400
You're telling me. That
guy can't even ride. I know.

572
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,000
Hey, boss!

573
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,400
What's this shushing stuff? If
you tell on Bob, I'll tell on you.

574
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,200
What do you mean? You're
talking to a real cowboy.

575
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,200
One hot dog, please. Yes,
ma'am. Well, so you got me.

576
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,200
We won't tell.
And you?

577
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,200
Not a word.
Gee, thanks.

578
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,800
Hey, you two.

579
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,400
Get busy and rope Wildcat, that little bay.

580
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,000
Can you ride him?

581
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,600
That one?
Yes.

582
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,000
He's talking to you. What about it?

583
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,000
I'm not gonna rope no horse.
You go ahead. Wait a minute.

584
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,400
You want him to think I'm
scared? But after all...

585
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,000
Do you want him to think
that I'm yellow? No!

586
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,600
I'm not gonna rope that!
Tell you what I'll do.

587
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,000
I'll wait out here. You go in there.

588
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,400
No, sir. You ain't gonna
put that over on me.

589
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,000
Then you go in there
and I'll wait out here.

590
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,600
That's better. All right,
go ahead. Get going.

591
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,200
Make it snappy. Go on. Get in there.

592
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,400
He's a killer. That's all I wanna know.

593
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,200
What's the matter? The
man said he's a killer.

594
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,200
He can't hurt us.

595
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,800
- Borrow my rope, buddy.
- Go ahead, go ahead.

596
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,000
Go ahead, get over there.

597
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,800
Okay.
Throw it!

598
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,200
That's it, get it.
Hey, I got him.

599
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,400
Pull him in. I got him.
I think he's got me.

600
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,000
If I didn't like ya,
I wouldn't let you do this.

601
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,000
Wish you wouldn't like
me so much. Pull him in.

602
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,600
Look, look!

603
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,600
It's a horse. Take it easy. What is this?

604
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:52,200
What kind of horse is
that? Not that one. Wildcat.

605
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,400
Another one?
The one over there.

606
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,800
Go ahead. What's the matter with you?

607
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,600
Let me through!
Aw, come on.

608
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,000
Pull me through!

609
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,600
Go out and let him know who's
boss. He knows who's boss!

610
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,600
Are you trying to show me up
in front of these boys? No.

611
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,200
Then go out there. You want me
to go there with that wildcat?

612
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,600
Okay, pal. So long,
everybody. Not that way!

613
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,200
Will you please... This
guy's always in the way.

614
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,000
Take this rope off.

615
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Get over there. Now lasso
him. Throw the rope out.

616
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Get outta here.
Do a nice job.

617
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,400
Wait! Take it easy.
You'll choke yourself.

618
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,600
Throw it out.
Get it out, way out.

619
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,600
Hey, boss, I think I
missed. I think you did too.

620
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,800
Hey, Duke, save me!
Save me! Save me!

621
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,600
Get him out of there
before he gets hurt.

622
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,800
Nice work, pal.
We'll handle him for ya.

623
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,200
Shut that gate!

624
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,800
Bring him back here.

625
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,200
Hurry up, boys.

626
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,600
Mr. Mitchell, we'll have him
ready for you in just a minute.

627
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,400
Hurry up, boys.
That's it.

628
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,400
This is the safest place
in the whole corral.

629
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,400
Come on, get down.

630
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,400
Get me off!

631
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,600
Hey, Duke...
Whoa, boy! Whoa!

632
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,600
The little guy's
plenty good.

633
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,200
Hey, Duke! Duke!
Get me off! Get me off!

634
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,200
- Grab my hand.
- Get me off!

635
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,800
Ya-hoo!
Look at that!

636
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,400
Bring that horse back!

637
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,800
You better get me this time.
I'm gonna come around again.

638
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,400
- Grab my hand.
- Get me off the horse!

639
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,000
How do you turn this thing off?

640
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,000
You all right?

641
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,400
Hey, Bob, get us off.
Come on, Bob. Get us off!

642
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,400
Hold on!

643
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,000
Get me off! Get me off!

644
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,800
Alabam, they were terrific!

645
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,800
Nice work. I never
realized you were so good.

646
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,000
Yeah?
Yeah.

647
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,800
Hey, Duke... Poor Duke... couldn't take it.

648
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,800
Come on.

649
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,000
Beside the Rio Tonto

650
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,400
On a starlit trail

651
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,400
He fell in love
with her smile

652
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:25,200
One autumn while
the moon was pale

653
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,000
And he knew
that she loved him

654
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:32,000
Just by the look
that she wore

655
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,400
That evening beside

656
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,400
The Rio Tonto shore

657
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,200
Two hearts
were young and happy

658
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,600
Love was all aglow

659
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,800
And as they laughed
and they dreamed

660
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:54,400
The heavens
seemed to overflow

661
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,400
Then one day
he grew restless

662
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,200
To roam and wander
once more

663
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,800
He left her beside

664
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,800
The Rio Tonto shore

665
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,400
He said his love for her
would be undying

666
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,200
And he'd return when
his wandering was through

667
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,000
But her poor heart
whispered sadly he's lying

668
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
It's strange
how it knew

669
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,600
And yet each night
she waits there

670
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:31,400
On the starlit trail

671
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,200
And prays he'll
come back again

672
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,000
Some autumn when
the moon is pale

673
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
And as each evening
passes

674
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,000
She sighs and waits
just one more

675
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,400
He'll find her beside

676
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:57,400
The Rio Tonto shore

677
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,000
There you are, boys.
I guess it's warm now.

678
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,600
Thanks, Ruby.
I never minded a baby before.

679
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,600
Well, is it all right?

680
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:13,000
It's the right temperature.
I gotta make my own formulas.

681
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
It's your work now.

682
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,800
Be nice, take your
din-din. Oh, give it to her.

683
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,000
Come on, take your din-din.

684
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,200
Don't be such a hog.
I feel so motherly,

685
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,000
I should have went to Vassar.

686
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,200
Will you shut her up?

687
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,400
Hey, Duke, think there's
a pin sticking her? Nah.

688
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,000
I don't think so now.

689
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,200
If you're going someplace,
why don't you take me with you?

690
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
How would you like to
attend another barbecue?

691
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,800
What are you doing here? We moved the
tribe down for his wedding to Moonbeam.

692
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,200
I'm too young to be a bride.
Get your trousseau ready.

693
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,200
They let us go,
but they sure mean business.

694
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,000
Duke, Duke.
What happened?

695
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,200
They got me.
They what?

696
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,000
They got me. Hey, Duke. No, no, Willoughby!

697
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,600
When you get back to New York,

698
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,600
tell the folks
I died with my boots on.

699
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,600
Duke! Don't go away.
All right, Willoughby.

700
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,800
Don't go away! Pull
yourself together. I won't!

701
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,400
Were you ever shot?
It's a burning feeling.

702
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,400
I don't mean indigestion.
I know how you feel.

703
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,600
This is awful.

704
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,800
Wait a minute. Twice in
the same place I got it.

705
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Duke? It's a couple of
cowboys at target practice.

706
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,200
I know...

707
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,400
What's the matter with you? Hmph!

708
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,000
Disappointed, eh?

709
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,000
That's it, that's right.
You've got him.

710
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,600
How long did that take? 43
seconds, you're improving.

711
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:17,400
Yeah, but not enough. Bob, if
you'll just do it like this.

712
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,600
If she don't like him,
why's she doing that?

713
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,800
That's love.
Oh, no. Oh, no.

714
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,200
Love is when you're
parked in a car.

715
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,800
What do you think?

716
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,200
You're all right.
There's nothing to it.

717
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,400
You expect me to do that? Sure, and better.

718
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,400
It was a great life
while it lasted.

719
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:53,600
Mount from the squaw side, the right.

720
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,200
Well, here we go.

721
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,800
That's it.
Hold it.

722
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,400
That's it!

723
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,800
Bob!

724
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,400
Bob! Bob!

725
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,800
Are ya hurt?

726
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,600
Oh, Bob.

727
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:23,600
Bob?
Hi.

728
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,000
You faker!

729
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,400
What are you two doing here?

730
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,000
We're just watching. Yeah,
she's teachin' him to...

731
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,800
To what? Two and two make four
and four and four make eight.

732
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,200
And eight and eight...
Then there's geography.

733
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,000
Get up to the barn.
It's milkin' time.

734
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,800
Do I have to milk
that bunch of cows?

735
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,800
No, not bunch, herd. Heard what?

736
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,400
Herd of cows. Sure, I heard
of cows. Think I'm a dummy?

737
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,600
No, a cow herd. What do
I care if a cow heard?

738
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,800
I didn't say anything
to be ashamed of.

739
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,800
Do you know what a cow gives?

740
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,800
A cow gives milk.
No, she don't.

741
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
You gotta take it away from
her. Let's get over to the barn.

742
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,200
What are you doing down there?

743
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:26,800
Tryin' to do this.
Don't lean on me!

744
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,800
Don't lean on me!

745
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,400
There must be a better way.

746
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,600
Can you move her over?
Move the stuff over.

747
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,200
Get off the finger!
Duke, she's on my hand.

748
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,200
Get it out. Get it out! Get it out!

749
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,000
Get it out yourself.
You milk her from the back.

750
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
From the back?
Certainly, not down there.

751
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,200
Cowboy! You've got to learn sometime.

752
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,800
Now what are you doing? There's
none of those things up here.

753
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,200
Duke, give me a pail.
Will you listen to me?

754
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,600
You milk her on the
stool. Oh, on the stool?

755
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,600
On the stool.
Now I know.

756
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:06,000
Get off there. Here. Stool.

757
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,200
Sit down.

758
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,600
Not you, the cow.
What for?

759
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,400
I'm gonna milk her. No, no, no,
here, put that under the udder.

760
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,800
The other what?
The cow's udder.

761
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,600
Cow's other what?
Under here, please!

762
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,800
Sit down there. Milk the cow.
You mean under the crankcase.

763
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,800
All right, call it what
you want. Get some milk.

764
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,200
Get some milk.

765
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,800
No?

766
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Come on, come on,
give me some milk.

767
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,400
Hey, you! Come on! Get in line!

768
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,400
I was here first.
What are you trying to do?

769
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,200
Why don't you pick on somebody
your size? I was here first.

770
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,600
I'm tryin' to get some
milk myself, you know.

771
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,800
After all!

772
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,000
Must have run dry.

773
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,600
Don't look at me. It ain't my
fault. First time I come here.

774
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:05,000
Hey, Duke! Duke, Duke. What's the matter?

775
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,000
Help me milk this cow. No, this is
a steer. A steer don't give milk.

776
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,600
No?
No!

777
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,000
Where does "steeralized" milk
come from? Make it snappy.

778
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I'm dying for a drink of raw milk. Okay.

779
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:18,000
All you get in restaurants is
"A" milk and "B" milk. Bee milk?

780
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,400
Do bees give milk?
No, honey.

781
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,600
Thanks, dear. Oh, come on, get with it.

782
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,800
Oooh! A four-tube set.

783
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,400
How do you tune it in?

784
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,200
You can never trust a woman, can ya?

785
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,400
Will ya cut it out?
Dare ya to do it once more.

786
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,800
She did.
Give me somethin'.

787
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,200
You do it once more I'll...

788
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,400
Once more...

789
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,600
I guess that'll hold ya.

790
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,400
This is a fine time
to be sleeping.

791
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,000
Come on, get up.
Come on, wake up.

792
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,400
What's the matter? What happened? Come on.

793
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,200
What's the matter with you?
Peanuts! Hot dogs! Milk!

794
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,400
Uh-oh!

795
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,600
That's trouble.
Wait a minute.

796
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,400
This looks bad.

797
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:28,400
"We've got the Indian sign on you.
Get a wedding license ready or else!"

798
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,600
Or else? I'm gettin' sick and
tired of havin' Indians threaten me.

799
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,400
I'll give 'em 10 minutes
to get out of town.

800
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,000
How long? I'll give 'em five
minutes to get out of town.

801
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,200
How long? Give me 10
seconds and I'll be packed.

802
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,800
Are you gonna let them
get away with that? No!

803
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,400
That's a boy. I'll get
those dirty redskins!

804
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,400
I knew it was in ya. Which
way did these arrows come from?

805
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,800
That way! That way? Let's... go this way!

806
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,400
This lovely day
has lengthened

807
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,800
Into evening

808
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,400
We'll sigh good-bye

809
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:35,000
To all we've ever had

810
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:40,800
Alone where we have
walked together

811
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,600
I'll remember April

812
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:51,400
And be glad

813
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,400
I'll be content

814
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:59,400
You loved me once
in April

815
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,200
Your lips were warm

816
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,200
And love and spring
were new

817
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:10,800
But I'm not afraid
of autumn

818
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,200
And her sorrow

819
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:18,600
For I'll remember

820
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:24,000
April and you

821
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:27,400
The fire will dwindle

822
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:32,200
Into glowing ashes

823
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,400
For flames
and love live

824
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,200
Such a little while

825
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,400
I won't forget

826
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,600
But I won't be lonely

827
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:50,400
I'll remember April

828
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:53,600
And I'll smile

829
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,400
The fire will dwindle

830
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:04,400
Into glowing ashes

831
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:11,000
For flames and love
live such a little while

832
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,600
I won't forget

833
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:18,800
But I won't be lonely

834
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:23,400
I'll remember April

835
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:27,000
And I'll smile

836
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,800
This ought to scare the
daylights out of'em. It better.

837
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,800
I spent the best part of the day
carvin' that face. Rush it up.

838
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,800
Over here, across from
his bunk. Here they come!

839
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,000
It's dark in here.
Put on the lights.

840
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,800
They got me. They got me. Where?

841
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:08,400
Right in the middle of the excitement.
Somebody's tryin' to kid you.

842
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:13,000
Funny kind of kiddin'. Every time
I turn around you know what happens?

843
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,400
What? Some Indian lets go with
an arrow... right by my kisser.

844
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,800
Come on, let's go to bed.

845
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,000
Hiya, partner.

846
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,000
Duke! Duke!
What's the matter?

847
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:31,000
It's only a dummy.
Look at it!

848
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,800
Those three boys put
that there to scare you.

849
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,400
They're very successful.
Touch it. It's only a dummy.

850
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:39,200
Feel it.
That's all there is to it.

851
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:46,400
Come on, let's wash up.

852
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,000
I'm not scared of you.

853
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,600
Willoughby, go get me the soap.
Go get me the soap!

854
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,600
Go get it yourself!

855
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,000
Willoughby, go get me the soap!

856
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
I'm not gonna get it! No!

857
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Go get me the soap, Willoughby!

858
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,200
All right.
That's better.

859
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,600
Dummy, eh?

860
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:33,400
I wish you was
the other guy you look like.

861
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,000
I'd let you have it.

862
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,600
Fine joint. Ain't even
a place to hang your hat.

863
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,600
I mean...

864
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,000
A knife, zip, right through my hat.

865
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
That's ridiculous.

866
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
No! Come on, come on!

867
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,400
Hey, Duke!
It was right...

868
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,400
What do you know?
What do you know...

869
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,600
There's your hat and
there's no knife in it. No?

870
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,600
That hole wasn't
put there by a moth.

871
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,200
Come here, I'll prove
this Indian is only a dummy.

872
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,400
Get over here.
What are you afraid of?

873
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:17,200
Look. Look.
Now get with it and go to bed.

874
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:21,200
No more of this nonsense.

875
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,200
Dummy, huh?

876
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,200
You look like a guy that
gave me Indian springwater.

877
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,600
The roof's leakin'.

878
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:36,000
I'd have sworn that guy moved.

879
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,200
Did you move?
No.

880
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,400
I'll fix you.
Put this in your mouth.

881
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:57,000
That's good. I'm gettin'
hysterical or something.

882
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,600
I don't know.

883
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,400
It's only a dummy.
No dummy's gonna do that...

884
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,600
Come here. No, I don't want to go in.

885
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:32,200
I'm tellin' ya, he's alive.
I saw the thing...

886
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,000
What got into you all of a sudden?

887
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,600
What are you afraid of? I'm
tellin' you this Indian's alive.

888
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:43,400
He done an awful lot of things to
me. You're crazy, it's impossible.

889
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,400
I'll show ya.
Go ahead, show me.

890
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,800
Now what?
What are you doing?

891
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:50,400
Nothin'.
It didn't work.

892
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,800
See him take a kick at
me. That's a dummy, dummy.

893
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,200
Well, he's alive.
Go on, get in bed.

894
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,600
What's the matter
with you all of a sudden?

895
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:02,600
That's no way to act. Get into
your nightgown and get some rest.

896
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,800
Where are you going? I'm
gonna change in the closet.

897
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:10,600
I'm bashful. All right,
go ahead in the closet.

898
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,800
What kept you? I was a
little long, wasn't I?

899
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,800
Certainly, get to bed.
I'll turn out the lights.

900
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
I don't want to hear of
Indians from you anymore.

901
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,400
Understand?
Get in there.

902
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,600
Don't mention Indians. That's
all I do is think of'em.

903
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,800
I'm always dreamin' of'em.
Think of something else.

904
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,800
Beautiful girls. I'll
think of beautiful girls,

905
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,800
but I'll dream about Indians. Go to sleep.

906
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:40,200
How do you do?
Something wrong?

907
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,600
Sanitarium? You the doctor? That's right.

908
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,600
Gotta have some rest.
I need a lot of rest.

909
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:48,400
All night long
when I sleep I see Indians.

910
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,600
Even when I turn around,
I bump into Indians.

911
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,600
I gotta have rest. You've
come to the right place.

912
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,000
You'll see no Indians here.
Everything will be all right.

913
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:03,600
Just a minute, just a minute. Take it easy.

914
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,600
You're in bad shape.
You do need a rest.

915
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:08,000
Wait, I'll see what
I can do for you.

916
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:12,600
Fellas, do you mind giving
this room up for tonight?

917
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,800
Come this way, please.

918
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:19,400
Come, come.
Come on. Take it easy.

919
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:22,600
That's the boy. Oh, nurse? Yes?

920
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,800
This is your nurse.

921
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:29,600
Another Indian. You an Indian?
You must be seeing things.

922
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,600
He's in bad shape.
Make sure everything is quiet.

923
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,600
I gotta have rest. Hang your
clothes up and get some sleep.

924
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:39,800
You'll be all right in the
morning. If you need me, just call.

925
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:58,800
What a beautiful bed of roses.
I think I'll water them.

926
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:02,600
That's enough, that's enough.

927
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:07,400
That's enough!
That's plenty!

928
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,200
I'm gettin' plenty
of rest tonight anyway.

929
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,400
Bite the dust!
I won't!

930
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,600
You will. You will. I won't. I won't.

931
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,000
Oooooh!

932
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,600
Come in at once! Water! Pocahontas fainted.

933
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,800
Fainted? Yes, John Smith
ran away with Minnehaha.

934
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,600
Phone for water!
Phone for water?

935
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:37,000
I'll help you, kids. I'll phone.
I don't like to see nobody faint.

936
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,200
Oh, boy, Pocahontas fainted.
I want some water.

937
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,800
And I got it too.

938
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,800
- Bite the dust!
- I won't!

939
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,200
- You will!
- I won't!

940
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
I got him...
with my finger.

941
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,400
Didn't work.
Run out of bullets.

942
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:06,600
That's enough.
Enough for me.

943
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,400
What are you doing?
You want to shoot me?

944
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:16,200
Would you like
to have your palm read?

945
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:24,600
Hee-hee-hee-hee!

946
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:39,000
General Custer!

947
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,400
Sitting Bull!

948
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:54,800
Duke! Duke! Hey, Duke!
Wake up, will ya? Yeah?

949
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:57,000
I'm scared.
What's the matter?

950
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,000
The whole room is full
of Indians. Where, where?

951
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,200
I saw two guys come in.
"Bite the dust." "I won't!"

952
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,000
The other guy shot him!
Bang! Took him out!

953
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:08,000
Come here, come here!
You've been dreaming.

954
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,600
What is it all about? A flock
of Indians all over the room!

955
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,600
What do you mean, flock of
Indians? Plenty of Indians.

956
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,600
There's not a single Indian here. Oh, no?

957
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,600
No! I know, they're
married and got children.

958
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:21,000
What are you talkin' about? Everybody was
in the room, but that one that throws knives.

959
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,400
Remember the hat? Are
you still afraid of that?

960
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,400
Afraid? You think he's still around?

961
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:29,200
I'll prove to you he's not.
Come here, come here.

962
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:32,000
He's not here.

963
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,200
He's not here.

964
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:42,200
He's not here.

965
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,600
If I know you, you're
gonna do one of two things.

966
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,600
You're gonna
break her heart or your neck.

967
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,600
Either way, you're gonna
break my pocketbook.

968
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,800
Mr. Mitchell?
Yeah?

969
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I'm Ace Anderson. How are ya?
Mr. Conway, my nursemaid.

970
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,400
How are you?
Good evening.

971
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,800
I own a club downtown
and I haven't seen you around.

972
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,400
I've been busy getting
ready for the rodeo.

973
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:10,200
Sam Shaw figures the Lazy "S" team
is a cinch to win with you on it.

974
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:15,000
I'm handling a $1,000 bet for him.

975
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,800
Mr. Shaw didn't strike me
as being a betting man.

976
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,800
He isn't as a rule, but he spent
so much money remodeling this place,

977
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,600
I guess he's counting
on getting some of it back.

978
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:27,600
I'll be seeing you down
at the club. Good-bye.

979
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,400
Mr. Anderson!

980
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,000
Look out, that guy
didn't come just to talk.

981
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:35,200
I know it.

982
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:42,000
Yeah? I'll handle Mr.
Shaw's bet myself at 10-to-1.

983
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,200
10-to-1? That's right, but my
name's got to be kept out of it.

984
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:48,800
It's a deal.

985
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,800
Hey, wait a minute.

986
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,200
Aren't you riding for
the Lazy "S" team?

987
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:56,600
You're betting $10,000 that your
own team loses? That's right.

988
01:07:56,600 --> 01:08:00,600
That makes it simpler, doesn't it?

989
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,600
I'll be seeing ya.

990
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,800
You know what that guy
thinks? Let him think it.

991
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Ten thousand smackers. You go
and kill yourself in that rodeo...

992
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,400
just to make sure
her old man wins that dough.

993
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,800
I give up.

994
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,800
Hey, Duke, you know what?
I would love to dance.

995
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,200
Why don't you? I gotta learn
how to do those kind of dances.

996
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,400
Go on out and do it.
I'd like to.

997
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,600
Go ahead.
You know the last...

998
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:37,600
Hey, Duke, I've been
robbed. What's the matter?

999
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,800
I've been robbed. In
here? You've been robbed?

1000
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,600
I had it when I left the
bunkhouse. You had what?

1001
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:45,400
My other leg! I want to dance
with the girls like everybody else.

1002
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,800
Your other leg?
I only got one leg!

1003
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,400
What are ya talkin'
about? What do you know?

1004
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,600
Am I happy?
You should be.

1005
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,000
Hello. Do you dance?
Why, yes.

1006
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
You have nice weather for it. Sit down.

1007
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,000
What's on your mind, Ace?
I just wanted you to know...

1008
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,400
that I bet 20 grand of my own money
that the Lazy "S" loses tomorrow.

1009
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:14,200
Why tell me? Well, see that you
don't happen to win any events.

1010
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,800
You ought to speak to Bronco
Bob Mitchell. He's the headman.

1011
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:20,800
I'm not worried about him.
He'll see that they lose.

1012
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:23,000
Bob Mitchell had me bet
10 grand at 10-to-1...

1013
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,600
that the Lazy "S" outfit loses.

1014
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,800
That's where I got my information.

1015
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Ace, I think you're lying.

1016
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:34,000
Whether you are or not, I'm riding
to win and no one's gonna stop me.

1017
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,400
Same old couples
forward and back

1018
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,800
Forward again
and sides dividing

1019
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,800
You swing in the center
and you swing on the side

1020
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:43,400
With an Alabama left
to the old left hand and back

1021
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,600
We got orders from Ace
to take you with us.

1022
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,200
Here we go with the old mess
wagon and a hind wheel broke

1023
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:51,400
And the axle draggin'
Meet your partner, promenade

1024
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,600
You know where
and I don't care

1025
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:57,200
Hey, what kind of old-fashioned
jive is that you've got

1026
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,600
Take it from me, pops
It's not so hot

1027
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,600
You say it's
an old square dance affair

1028
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,000
Well, you're right there
It sure is square

1029
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,600
Don't be a chump Do a
square dance but make it jump

1030
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,200
What you say we all go
rockin' and reelin'

1031
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,800
Make the old Virginia reel
really hop

1032
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:16,000
The corn will thrive
if you plant it in jive

1033
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,400
I'll bet that it pops
your top

1034
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,800
Hit the timber and
go rockin' and reelin'

1035
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,200
Do the boogie if
the beat is in eight

1036
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,400
You're just nowhere
if you dance in a square

1037
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:28,000
'Cause you'll swing
like a rusty gate

1038
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,400
Put rhythm to
your do-si-doin'

1039
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,600
It's easy to make it mix

1040
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,000
Keep jumpin'
when you're heel and toein'

1041
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,200
If you really want
to get your kicks

1042
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:39,600
Swing your partner when
you're rockin' and reelin'

1043
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,000
Do your dancin'
like you haven't a care

1044
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,200
You'll be first class
You'll be cookin' with gas

1045
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:47,000
If you go rockin'
round the square

1046
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,600
Ruby, Ruby
We want Ruby

1047
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,800
She's the gal
on the mellow side

1048
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:56,400
Ruby, come on, Ruby, just
let rhythm be your guide

1049
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,800
Give the calls
Make 'em up

1050
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,200
Do it in jive
and break 'em up

1051
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:05,600
Well, if you want me to do it I'll
have these cats come on fit to kill

1052
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:10,200
And we'll show you how they rock the
square back in Harlem on Sugar Hill

1053
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,800
Now if you really want
to get your boots laced

1054
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,000
Start out with
the old shim-sham

1055
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,400
And play back that jive
I laid on you, pops

1056
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:20,200
You're on your own
So cut out and jam

1057
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:41,400
What ya say we all go
rockin' and reelin'

1058
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:44,000
Make the old Virginia reel
really hop

1059
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,200
The corn will thrive
if you plant it in jive

1060
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:49,000
I'll bet it pops
your top

1061
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,200
Hit the timber
go rockin' and reelin'

1062
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,400
Do the boogie-woogie
if the beat is in eight

1063
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,800
You're just nowhere
if your dancin' is square

1064
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,800
'Cause you swing
like a rusty gate

1065
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:03,000
Put rhythm to your
do-si-doin' It's easy to mix

1066
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,800
Keepjumpin'when you're heelin'and
toein'if you want to get your kicks

1067
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:12,200
Swing your partner Go rockin' and
reelin' like you haven't a care

1068
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:15,400
You'll be first class
You'll be cookin'with gas

1069
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:20,000
Heelin', toein' Rock,
rock rockin' 'n' reelin'

1070
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,200
Rock, rock
rockin' 'n' reelin'

1071
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:26,200
When you're rockin'
around the square

1072
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:44,600
But, Miss Anne, that's
what that fella told Alabam.

1073
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:47,000
That's true, 'cause I heard it
with my one good ear. This one...

1074
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
This one over here.
This one over here.

1075
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I don't believe it. Bob
wouldn't bet against himself.

1076
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,400
Then why not ask Alabam? Oh, no.

1077
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,600
Morning, everybody.
Uh-oh, there he is.

1078
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,800
Why you, I ought to haul off and give you
the dirtiest look you ever had in your life.

1079
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
What is this? What's going on? Bob,

1080
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,800
did you make a bet through Ace
Anderson that the Lazy "S" would lose?

1081
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,600
Oh, you heard?

1082
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:18,000
Listen, I'm gonna ride today
and I'm gonna ride to win.

1083
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,000
As far as I'm concerned, you can do
all your riding on a train heading east.

1084
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:25,800
Now listen...
I want to...

1085
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:30,800
What are you doing?

1086
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:33,400
Hey, wait a minute, you guys
got a customer. Let's get going.

1087
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,400
You don't understand. Oh,
yes, we do. You're a bad boy!

1088
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:41,400
You got me wrong. Oh, no!
We ain't got you wrong.

1089
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,600
If I got you wrong, I hope I
knock a fender off this car.

1090
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:51,600
Okay, get in.
We're wrong.

1091
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:55,000
So that's why I wanted
to lose the money.

1092
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,400
Ten thousand buckaroos to win
a girl? That's love, all right.

1093
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:01,600
That's inflation. It's all your
fault. You had to spoil a romance.

1094
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,400
You and your eavesdropping. Eavesdropping?

1095
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,400
I never dropped an eave in my life.

1096
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:10,000
I ought to give you back to
the Indians. Anything but that!

1097
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:16,200
What do you know? Somebody
must be usin' a slingshot.

1098
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:19,200
Sit still.
I'll get it.

1099
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:23,400
All right, reach.

1100
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,600
Come on, give me your gun.

1101
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:30,000
What's the big idea? Take it
easy and you won't get hurt.

1102
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,200
I'll go get help!

1103
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:37,400
Ooo-ooo-ooo!

1104
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,200
I don't care what your reasons were
for betting on the Lazy "S" to lose.

1105
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:47,200
I can be positive they don't
win by holding you and Alabam.

1106
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:51,000
Yeah, we got you good, Bronco Bob.

1107
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,600
It ain't as easy to escape from here
as it was in them books of yours.

1108
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:57,200
Why? Are you a fan of mine? I'll say I am.

1109
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:00,400
You know that book, I Escaped
from Outlaws? That was swell.

1110
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,600
Remember, Ace,
I was readin'it to you.

1111
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:07,800
That took place in a cabin like
this, didn't it? Yeah, it did.

1112
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:12,800
There I was, a prisoner. The
outlaw chief was pacing up and down.

1113
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,600
The window was open.
Now let's see...

1114
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,600
Come on!

1115
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,000
Help!

1116
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:23,000
Hey, you're hurt. Never mind
that. Let's get back to the rodeo.

1117
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:26,400
Let's make sure
our friend stays here first.

1118
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,600
I gotta get help. We should have
stayed and fought it out with them.

1119
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,600
Hey, hey, look!
Stop, stop, stop.

1120
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:41,600
Look! Look!
Oh, just Indians.

1121
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,600
Come on, get going!

1122
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,800
Come on, step on it! Go
ahead, step on it! Go away.

1123
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:50,800
Come on, they're getting closer.

1124
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Way back!
They have no brakes!

1125
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:03,400
Attaboy, Willoughby!

1126
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:08,200
Come on, step on it!

1127
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,400
Hey, take off your brake!
Take off your brake!

1128
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,800
Take off the brake?
Take off your brake!

1129
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Take it off. Take it off! What do I do now?

1130
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,800
Release it!
Okay!

1131
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Here they come!
Don't let go of the wheel!

1132
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,200
Willoughby, grab the wheel!

1133
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,600
What did you let go
of the wheel for?

1134
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:39,400
I can't drive!
What's the matter?

1135
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,000
All right, I'll take
care of everything.

1136
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,200
What's the matter?
What are you doing?

1137
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,400
Hey, DiMaggio
got another hit.

1138
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:51,200
Put that down!

1139
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:57,800
Hey, look, no hands! No, don't!

1140
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,600
Something wrong?
See my hat?

1141
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,800
No.
There it is.

1142
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:11,200
Thank you.

1143
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,600
We got rid of the Indians.

1144
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,800
Look out!

1145
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:40,200
Sunday driver! Never mind him.
Your troubles are behind you.

1146
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,000
Hey, wait a minute!

1147
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,600
Oh, boy, that...

1148
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,400
There they are again.
Go ahead!

1149
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:53,600
Oh, fluid drive.

1150
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:59,000
Hey! Who's chasing who?

1151
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,600
Boy, was that a close shave. You said it.

1152
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:38,400
Faster, faster.
Keep it going.

1153
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:43,200
Go get help, go get help!
Come here, come here!

1154
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,600
You went the wrong way!
This way! Hurry up!

1155
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:48,400
Hey! I didn't see that! Get it out!

1156
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:55,600
Hey, Duke, does this
place look familiar to you?

1157
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:59,000
Ya dope! We're right back
at the spot we started from!

1158
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,600
Ain't I uncanny? You are. Now listen to me.

1159
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:05,200
Take the turns I tell ya to take.
Bob's in trouble. Now get going.

1160
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:27,200
Let's see who's in this
broncobusting contest.

1161
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:31,400
I don't suppose there's any doubt
of his showing up, is there, Conway?

1162
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:34,600
This is dull stuff, Manning. What
do you say we go find some real fun?

1163
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:38,200
The next event is the
girls'fancy-riding contest.

1164
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:43,400
Good luck, there's a lot more
at stake than the prize money.

1165
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:47,200
A lot more? Yeah, Ace Anderson had
somebody put up $10,000 that we'd lose.

1166
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:50,800
Ten thousand do...

1167
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,200
Why, Dad,

1168
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,600
then Bob...

1169
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:59,000
Bob wanted to lose so we'd win.
That doesn't make sense.

1170
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,000
It certainly does.
Come on!

1171
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:17,600
Hey, come on! Hey, Alabam! Get in the car.

1172
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,800
He's hurt. Oh, it's nothing.
It's just a little...

1173
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,400
Blood.

1174
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:28,400
The Lazy "S" outfit's in
second place with 27 points,

1175
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:31,800
including the first place
won by Miss Anne Shaw.

1176
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,000
And now the final contestant
in broncobustin',

1177
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,600
also representing
the Lazy "S" Ranch,

1178
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:45,800
that celebrated personality,
Bronco Bob Mitchell.

1179
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,800
Where's Bob? Has anyone seen him? No!

1180
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Alabam hasn't shown up either.

1181
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,000
That's strange.
Anne?

1182
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,000
You don't mean that you want Bob to
ride? Of course I want him to ride.

1183
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,400
Bronco Bob Mitchell is wanted at
the chutes. Judges are waiting.

1184
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:03,200
He was gonna ride, was he?

1185
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:09,800
Bronco Bob Mitchell, having failed
to appear, the contest is forfeited.

1186
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,600
The winner is...
But wait, here he is!

1187
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,400
Where have you been? Get
Alabam to first aid right away.

1188
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:21,000
What happened to him? He
got shot. I'll explain later.

1189
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Look, about that bet... We know all
about that. You get in there and ride!

1190
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,600
Ride 'em, cowboy!

1191
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:01,000
We win! We win! We win!

1192
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,400
Hello, bridegroom.

1193
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:14,200
Ride 'em, cowboy
ride

1194
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,600
We're all together
side by side

1195
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:21,000
All good men and every one a
rooting tooting son of a gun

1196
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:24,400
Come on and ride 'em, cowboy
ride

1197
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:28,200
Bust 'em high and wide

1198
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:31,200
And when our pay's
been roped and tied

1199
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:35,200
We'll be off to paint the town
to set 'em up and drink 'em down

1200
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,800
Come on and ride 'em, cowboy
ride

1201
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:42,000
Give me a life out on the plains,
a horse with lightning in his veins

1202
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,600
And for my comrades
the men of the West

1203
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:49,000
A cowboy's friends are rough and tough
but they're his friends and that's enough

1204
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,000
They're tried and true men
and they're the best

1205
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:56,200
So ride 'em, cowboy
ride

1206
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:59,800
We're all together
side by side

1207
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:03,200
They're all good men and every
one a rooting tooting son of a gun

1208
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:07,200
Come on and ride 'em, cowboy
ride

1209
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,400
Bust 'em high and wide

1210
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:13,600
And when our pay's
been roped and tied

1211
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:17,200
We'll be off to paint the town
to set 'em up and drink 'em down

1212
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:21,200
We're gonna ride 'em, cowboy
ride
