and Finn's not the quarterback</i>

Can you believe it? Kurt's dad</i>

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,564
<i>and Finn's mom are dating,
and are really happy together,</i>

5
00:00:08,615 --> 00:00:10,232
<i>which makes Finn and Kurt
sort of like brothers.</i>

6
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,450
<i>They sure yell at each other
like brothers.</i>

7
00:00:11,534 --> 00:00:13,152
Why is it so hard
for you to understand?

8
00:00:13,236 --> 00:00:14,937
<i>Sue has a sister, Jean,
who she doesn't yell at at all.</i>

9
00:00:15,004 --> 00:00:16,321
I will always
love you.

10
00:00:16,389 --> 00:00:18,273
<i>Which sort of makes her
the only person</i>

11
00:00:18,324 --> 00:00:21,677
<i>Sue doesn't yell at. And that's
what you missed on Glee.</i>

12
00:00:21,744 --> 00:00:23,662
<i>FINN:
It all started a week ago.</i>

13
00:00:23,746 --> 00:00:25,964
<i>I was super hungry,
but my mom was gone,</i>

14
00:00:26,049 --> 00:00:27,949
<i>so I busted out
the George Foreman.</i>

15
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:30,886
<i>It wasn't making the cool
grill marks it used to after</i>

16
00:00:30,954 --> 00:00:32,754
<i>I tried to use it
to dry my shoes,</i>

17
00:00:32,806 --> 00:00:34,273
<i>but when it comes
to grilled cheese,</i>

18
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,607
<i>I'm not that fancy.</i>

19
00:00:35,675 --> 00:00:37,976
<i>And when I pulled
the sandwich out,</i>

20
00:00:38,061 --> 00:00:40,179
<i>I saw the face of God.</i>

21
00:00:40,263 --> 00:00:41,930
<i>Literally.</i>

22
00:00:41,981 --> 00:00:44,483
<i>I had made a Grilled Cheesus.</i>

23
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,272
<i>I'm so hungry.
I'm not the most religious guy.</i>

24
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,491
<i>I sort of worship Eric Clapton
and Ochocinco,</i>

25
00:00:52,575 --> 00:00:54,676
<i>but this was different, so,</i>

26
00:00:54,744 --> 00:00:58,030
<i>I decided to see what it felt
like to, you know, pray.</i>

27
00:00:58,097 --> 00:01:00,499
Dear Grilled Cheesus...

28
00:01:00,567 --> 00:01:02,117
First of all,
you're super delicious.

29
00:01:02,168 --> 00:01:03,485
Please, Grilled Cheesus,

30
00:01:03,536 --> 00:01:05,454
please let us win
our first football game.

31
00:01:05,505 --> 00:01:07,172
It would mean so much to Artie,

32
00:01:07,257 --> 00:01:09,641
and I think you kind of
owe it to him.

33
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:12,494
I mean, you did sort of
screw him in the leg department.

34
00:01:12,545 --> 00:01:14,997
And in return, Cheesy Lord,

35
00:01:15,064 --> 00:01:17,749
I'll make sure we honour you
this week in Glee Club.

36
00:01:17,817 --> 00:01:20,719
{crowd roaring,
players grunting}

37
00:01:20,803 --> 00:01:22,003
{whistle blowing}

38
00:01:22,055 --> 00:01:23,188
{cheering}

39
00:01:26,526 --> 00:01:29,328
Thank you, Grilled Cheesus.

40
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:38,987
Hey, Dad.
Hey, that's my boy.

41
00:01:39,038 --> 00:01:41,073
You forgot your breakfast.

42
00:01:41,157 --> 00:01:42,524
Suzanne Somers says that
skipping breakfast is suicide.

43
00:01:42,575 --> 00:01:44,293
What is this?

44
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,411
It's an egg white wrap
on a sprouted wheat tortilla,

45
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,829
half a grapefruit
and a green drink.

46
00:01:47,881 --> 00:01:49,164
Where's my usual breakfast?

47
00:01:49,232 --> 00:01:50,249
A Coke and two Slim Jims?

48
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,583
Yeah. Breakfast of champions.

49
00:01:51,668 --> 00:01:53,034
Dad, you are not
a kid anymore.

50
00:01:53,086 --> 00:01:54,536
You have to start
taking care of yourself.

51
00:01:54,604 --> 00:01:55,837
Well, I guess with
enough hot sauce,

52
00:01:55,889 --> 00:01:57,806
this will  all
right. Thanks.

53
00:01:57,873 --> 00:02:00,041
Hey, don't forget,
Friday night dinner is 6:00

54
00:02:00,093 --> 00:02:01,560
instead of 7:00
this week.

55
00:02:01,644 --> 00:02:03,312
Carole and Finn are coming over,

56
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:05,213
and she has to work
the night shift.

57
00:02:05,265 --> 00:02:06,932
I-I can't do this Friday.

58
00:02:07,016 --> 00:02:08,901
<i>It's Sing-along Sound of Music
at the El Royale theatre.</i>

59
00:02:08,985 --> 00:02:10,102
It's a once-a-year event.

60
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,020
And last week,
you had to camp out early

61
00:02:12,071 --> 00:02:14,356
<i>so you could be first in line
for those Grey's Anatomy DVDs.</i>

62
00:02:14,407 --> 00:02:15,691
Season six, Dad.

63
00:02:15,742 --> 00:02:17,559
Okay, those Friday night
dinners are a ritual

64
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,745
in our family--
one your mom started.

65
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:21,280
I know, but I'm a teenager.

66
00:02:21,364 --> 00:02:23,248
Friday nights
are kind of important to me.

67
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,450
Why are you making me
feel guilty about this?

68
00:02:25,535 --> 00:02:27,119
I, of all people,
know how important

69
00:02:27,203 --> 00:02:28,754
the relationship is
between you and Carole.

70
00:02:28,838 --> 00:02:30,122
Those dinners are more
than important.

71
00:02:30,206 --> 00:02:32,407
They're sacred.
Okay, the whole point

72
00:02:32,475 --> 00:02:34,760
of having something sacred is
that it takes precedence

73
00:02:34,844 --> 00:02:36,878
over anything else
you got going on.

74
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,413
<i>Sing-along Sound of Music
is sacred to me.</i>

75
00:02:38,481 --> 00:02:39,781
What? You think
I don't know that?

76
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:41,383
Okay, wasn't I the one
who bought you

77
00:02:41,434 --> 00:02:42,684
that Maria bonnet
when you were six?

78
00:02:42,752 --> 00:02:44,052
Okay, the point is,

79
00:02:44,103 --> 00:02:46,421
if you start giving up stuff
like Friday night dinners,

80
00:02:46,472 --> 00:02:48,006
then you got nothing
to hold onto.

81
00:02:48,074 --> 00:02:49,358
Okay, let's face it, Kurt.

82
00:02:49,425 --> 00:02:51,443
If we don't schedule it,
then we don't hang out.

83
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:53,111
If we don't hang out,
then our lives--

84
00:02:53,196 --> 00:02:54,479
they just go right by
each other.

85
00:02:54,564 --> 00:02:56,198
And we don't share very much.

86
00:02:56,265 --> 00:02:59,534
I'm sorry, but I'm not missing
something that I look forward to

87
00:02:59,602 --> 00:03:02,571
all year just for
another dinner.

88
00:03:02,622 --> 00:03:04,406
Maybe we could do it
Thursday or something.

89
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,159
I got to tell you, Kurt.

90
00:03:07,243 --> 00:03:11,380
I'm real disappointed in you.

91
00:03:14,968 --> 00:03:16,251
{school bell ringing}

92
00:03:16,302 --> 00:03:18,053
Mr. Shue?

93
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,338
I have something to say.

94
00:03:19,422 --> 00:03:21,122
Something happened to me,

95
00:03:21,174 --> 00:03:24,259
and I can't really get into it,
but it's shaken me to my core.

96
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,143
Oh, my God, he's coming out.

97
00:03:25,228 --> 00:03:26,728
Why, yes,

98
00:03:26,796 --> 00:03:29,765
there is a man who's sort of
recently come into my life, and

99
00:03:29,832 --> 00:03:32,184
that man is Jesus Christ.

100
00:03:33,586 --> 00:03:34,903
That's way worse.

101
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:35,771
And I know
there's others

102
00:03:35,822 --> 00:03:37,055
in here who dig him, too.

103
00:03:37,123 --> 00:03:39,091
And so I thought,
maybe this week,

104
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:41,710
we could pay tribute
to him in music.

105
00:03:41,778 --> 00:03:44,780
You know, pay
tribute to Jesus.

106
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:46,331
Sorry, uh,
but if I wanted to sing

107
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,866
about Jesus, I'd go to church.

108
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,951
And the reason I don't go
to church is because

109
00:03:50,003 --> 00:03:52,537
most churches don't think
very much of gay people.

110
00:03:52,622 --> 00:03:54,873
Or women. Or science.

111
00:03:54,957 --> 00:03:56,475
I don't see anything wrong
with getting a little church

112
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:57,426
up in here.
I agree.

113
00:03:57,493 --> 00:03:58,710
I've had a really hard year,

114
00:03:58,778 --> 00:04:00,195
and I turned to God
a lot for help.

115
00:04:00,263 --> 00:04:02,447
I, for one, wouldn't mind
saying thanks.

116
00:04:02,515 --> 00:04:05,100
Thanks for what? That it
didn't come out a lizard baby?

117
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:06,668
Whenever I pray, I fall asleep.

118
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,969
Well, guys,
maybe our song selections

119
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:09,438
don't have to be about Jesus.

120
00:04:09,505 --> 00:04:11,857
We could do songs
about spirituality.

121
00:04:12,975 --> 00:04:14,309
You got a problem with Jesus?

122
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,811
Oh, I got no problem
with the guy.

123
00:04:15,862 --> 00:04:16,978
I'm a total Jew for Jesus.

124
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,280
He's my number one Heb.

125
00:04:18,348 --> 00:04:20,599
What I don't like seeing
is people using J-money

126
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:22,951
to cramp everybody
else's style, 'cause it seems

127
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:25,620
to me that true spirituality
or whatever you want to call it

128
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:27,539
is about enjoying the life
that you've been given.

129
00:04:27,607 --> 00:04:29,958
I mean, I see God every time
I make out with a new chick.

130
00:04:30,026 --> 00:04:31,309
RACHEL: Okay, okay,
that doesn't make

131
00:04:31,377 --> 00:04:33,245
any sense.
In fact, it's stupid.

132
00:04:33,312 --> 00:04:36,081
Are you calling
Mr. Billy Joel stupid?

133
00:04:36,165 --> 00:04:38,250
At this time, I'd like
to continue my streak

134
00:04:38,334 --> 00:04:39,868
of doing only songs
by Jewish artists.

135
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,422
Hit it.

136

Yeah, just a little
indigestion, you know.

Don't buy salami

Kurt?

172
00:06:56,305 --> 00:06:57,739
Can we talk to you outside?

173
00:07:06,448 --> 00:07:08,333
Where is he?

174
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:10,085
Is he dead?

175
00:07:10,136 --> 00:07:11,469
No, he's alive, but I'm sorry

176
00:07:11,554 --> 00:07:13,071
I don't have
any other good news.

177
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:14,923
I want to see him.
He hasn't regained
consciousness.

178
00:07:14,974 --> 00:07:16,007
WILL:
I thought he had
a heart attack.

179
00:07:16,092 --> 00:07:17,259
Brought on by an arrhythmia,

180
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,844
which caused a lack
of blood to his brain.

181
00:07:18,928 --> 00:07:19,845
That's what made him
lose consciousness

182
00:07:19,929 --> 00:07:21,012
and what's keeping him comatose.

183
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:22,430
We have him on lidocaine,

184
00:07:22,481 --> 00:07:24,933
but there's no guarantees
they're going to work

185
00:07:24,984 --> 00:07:26,401
or what kind of damage was done

186
00:07:26,468 --> 00:07:28,019
to his brain
by the lack of oxygen.

187
00:07:28,104 --> 00:07:29,571
I don't understand
what you're saying.

188
00:07:29,638 --> 00:07:31,306
When is he going
to wake up?

189
00:07:31,357 --> 00:07:32,807
I don't know.

190
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:36,578
Okay, just-just...
just take us to him now, please.

191
00:07:38,281 --> 00:07:40,949
{monitor beeping}

192
00:07:50,176 --> 00:07:52,027
I need a minute.

193
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,047
I don't think you
should be alone, Kurt.

194
00:07:56,132 --> 00:07:58,600
Please just give me a moment
alone with my father.

195
00:08:01,837 --> 00:08:05,206
We'll be right outside.

196
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:18,954
Dad?

197
00:08:23,692 --> 00:08:25,543
Can you hear me?

198
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:29,514
If you can hear me,

199
00:08:29,582 --> 00:08:31,433
squeeze my hand.

200
00:08:34,754 --> 00:08:36,671
I'm holding yours right now.

201
00:08:40,209 --> 00:08:42,227
Just squeeze back.

202
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:44,896
Come on, Dad.

203
00:08:44,981 --> 00:08:47,482
<i>Just squeeze my nd.</i>

204
00:08:52,403 --> 00:08:54,305
<i>What up, Grilled Cheesus?</i>

205
00:08:54,372 --> 00:08:56,540
<i>I need to ask you
for something.</i>

206
00:08:56,591 --> 00:08:58,159
I didn't go to Sunday school
so I don't know

207
00:08:58,226 --> 00:09:00,544
if God works the same as a genie
and I only get three wishes,

208
00:09:00,595 --> 00:09:01,946
but here's the thing.

209
00:09:02,013 --> 00:09:03,914
Dating Rachel is great,

210
00:09:03,965 --> 00:09:06,967
but she's kind of a prude,
and I'm sort of going crazy.

211
00:09:07,035 --> 00:09:08,719
Anyway, her boobs
aren't that great,

212
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,688
but they're still girl boobs,

213
00:09:10,755 --> 00:09:12,456
and I'd really like
to touch them.

214
00:09:12,524 --> 00:09:14,258
So, Cheesus,

215
00:09:14,326 --> 00:09:15,926
considering
that I've dedicated a week

216
00:09:15,977 --> 00:09:18,212
of my musical life to you,

217
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,564
I hope you can see it
in your heart

218
00:09:20,615 --> 00:09:22,233
to answer my prayers.

219
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:26,287
Amen.

220
00:09:26,354 --> 00:09:27,922
{school bell ringing}

221
00:09:40,118 --> 00:09:41,802
SANTANA:
Hey, Kurt.

222
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,255
We're really sorry
about your dad's heart attack.

223
00:09:44,306 --> 00:09:46,056
Thanks, Santana.

224
00:09:46,124 --> 00:09:47,758
I did a book report
on heart attacks,

225
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:49,626
if you want to give it
to the doctor.

226
00:09:49,678 --> 00:09:51,312
I got knocked down
an entire letter grade

227
00:09:51,396 --> 00:09:52,963
'cause it was written
in crayon.

228
00:09:53,014 --> 00:09:55,899
What the hell happened?

229
00:09:55,951 --> 00:09:57,418
My dad's in the hospital.
I know.

230
00:09:57,502 --> 00:09:59,837
My mom just called me. I feel
like I'm the last one to know!

231
00:09:59,904 --> 00:10:01,505
Well, I'm sorry, Finn.
It didn't occur to me

232
00:10:01,573 --> 00:10:02,923
to call you, because
he's not your father.

233
00:10:03,008 --> 00:10:04,408
Yeah, well, he's the closest
I'm ever going to get, okay?

234
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:07,795
I know it may not look like
what everybody else has,

235
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,980
but I thought we were...
sort of a family.

236
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,851
Look, I-I guess I just...

237
00:10:13,918 --> 00:10:15,252
I didn't like overhearing

238
00:10:15,303 --> 00:10:17,154
other people talking about it
in gym class.

239
00:10:25,447 --> 00:10:26,564
Hey, guys.

240
00:10:26,615 --> 00:10:29,766
Our thoughts are all
with Kurt, and, uh,

241
00:10:29,818 --> 00:10:31,785
I know it's sort of hard to
really focus on anything else...

242
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,903
MERCEDES:
Mr. Shue

243
00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:34,188
Yeah.
I've been struggling, trying

244
00:10:34,256 --> 00:10:36,006
to figure out
what I wanted to say to Kurt

245
00:10:36,074 --> 00:10:38,075
all day,
and I realize

246
00:10:38,143 --> 00:10:39,409
I don't want to say it,
I want to sing it.

247
00:10:41,096 --> 00:10:44,715
This song is about
being in a very dark place,

248
00:10:44,766 --> 00:10:45,799
and turning to God.

249
00:10:45,884 --> 00:10:47,801
It's a spiritual song,
Mr. Shue.

250
00:10:47,869 --> 00:10:49,586
Is that okay?
It's fine.

251
00:10:51,056 --> 00:10:53,474
Tina, Quinn, can you
help me out, please?

252
00:10:53,558 --> 00:10:55,425

{applause}

275
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:37,211
{sighs}
Thank you,

276
00:12:37,295 --> 00:12:38,629
Mercedes.

277
00:12:38,696 --> 00:12:40,631
Your voice is stunning, but...

278
00:12:40,698 --> 00:12:42,199
I don't believe in God.

279
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,751
Wait, what?

280
00:12:43,818 --> 00:12:45,002
You've all professed
your beliefs.

281
00:12:45,053 --> 00:12:46,420
I'm just stating mine.

282
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:49,256
I think God is kind of like
Santa Claus for adults.

283
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,373
Otherwise,

284
00:12:50,425 --> 00:12:52,026
God's kind of a jerk,

285
00:12:52,093 --> 00:12:53,210
isn't he?

286
00:12:53,261 --> 00:12:55,378
I mean, he makes
me gay and then

287
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,848
has his followers going
around telling me it's
something that I chose.

288
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:59,600
<i>As if someone would
choose to be mocked</i>

289
00:12:59,684 --> 00:13:01,151
every single day of their life.

290
00:13:01,219 --> 00:13:02,719
And right now

291
00:13:02,771 --> 00:13:04,521
I don't want a heavenly father.

292
00:13:04,572 --> 00:13:06,006
I want my real one back.

293
00:13:06,074 --> 00:13:08,158
But Kurt, how
do you know for sure?

294
00:13:08,226 --> 00:13:10,277
I mean, you can't prove
that there's no God.

295
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:12,246
<i>You can't prove that there
isn't a magic teapot</i>

296
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,248
floating around
on the dark side of the moon

297
00:13:14,315 --> 00:13:15,783
with a dwarf inside of it

298
00:13:15,867 --> 00:13:18,285
that reads romance novels
and shoots lightning

299
00:13:18,369 --> 00:13:21,955
out of its boobs, but it seems
pretty unlikely, doesn't it?

300
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,091
Is God an evil dwarf?

301
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:25,909
We shouldn't be
talking like this.

302
00:13:25,977 --> 00:13:27,044
It's not right.

303
00:13:27,095 --> 00:13:29,246
I'm sorry, Quinn.

304
00:13:29,297 --> 00:13:32,049
But you all can believe
whatever you want to.

305
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,234
But I can't believe
something I don't.

306
00:13:34,302 --> 00:13:36,520
I appreciate your thoughts...

307
00:13:36,587 --> 00:13:39,422
but I don't want your prayers.

308
00:13:41,425 --> 00:13:43,560
<i>WILL:
How did you even find out
about the lesson?</i>

309
00:13:43,628 --> 00:13:45,612
I have cameras
everywhere, William.

310
00:13:45,697 --> 00:13:47,597
I'm ving a lesson
on spirituality.

311
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:49,316
I don't understand
what the big deal is.

312
00:13:49,384 --> 00:13:51,452
Well, the big deal is
that this is a public school,

313
00:13:51,536 --> 00:13:52,703
and there's this little thing

314
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:53,821
called separation
of church and state,

315
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:55,155
<i>which happens
to be the pillar</i>

316
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,606
of a functioning
civil society.

317
00:13:56,658 --> 00:13:57,958
But Sue,
children should be

318
00:13:58,042 --> 00:14:00,544
allowed to profess
whatever faith they choose.

319
00:14:00,611 --> 00:14:03,213
At the BET Awards,
but not in a public school.

320
00:14:03,281 --> 00:14:04,631
Sue, I'm trying
to help these kids.

321
00:14:04,716 --> 00:14:06,750
Kurt is struggling with
some really tough issues.

322
00:14:06,818 --> 00:14:09,503
Well, William, if your kids want
to praise Jesus in class,

323
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:12,455
I suggest they enroll at Sweet
Holy Mother of God Academy

324
00:14:12,507 --> 00:14:13,507
on I Love Jesus Street,

325
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:14,758
but not here.

326
00:14:14,826 --> 00:14:16,459
This country is
not a monarchy, William.

327
00:14:16,511 --> 00:14:17,811
Trust me, I've tried.

328
00:14:17,896 --> 00:14:20,514
And as much as I enjoy
giving impromptu civics lessons,

329
00:14:20,598 --> 00:14:21,865
I got work to do.

330
00:14:28,556 --> 00:14:30,807
Finn, please... sit.

331
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,948
You're upset about
Kurt's dad, too?

332
00:14:38,016 --> 00:14:39,650
Yes.

333
00:14:39,717 --> 00:14:42,069
But more importantly,
let's discuss

334
00:14:42,137 --> 00:14:44,688
your newfound love for Jesus
and how it's affecting me.

335
00:14:44,756 --> 00:14:47,657
I want this
relationship

336
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:49,059
to go the distance,

337
00:14:49,127 --> 00:14:51,712
but I need to know that
when I'm 25 and I've won

338
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:53,096
a bunch of Tonys,
and I'm ready

339
00:14:53,164 --> 00:14:54,898
to have intercourse and babies,
that those babies will

340
00:14:54,966 --> 00:14:56,666
be raised in
a certain way.
You don't think

341
00:14:56,718 --> 00:14:58,068
you're gonna have sex
till you're 25?

342
00:14:58,136 --> 00:15:00,170
I want my children to be raised
in the Jewish faith.

343
00:15:00,238 --> 00:15:01,889
Both of my dads' peoples
were slaves once.

344
00:15:01,973 --> 00:15:04,608
I need to know that my children
will be free to worship

345
00:15:04,675 --> 00:15:06,226
<i>in the way that
I decide is right.</i>

346
00:15:06,311 --> 00:15:08,645
Sure. Of course.

347
00:15:08,713 --> 00:15:10,998
Yeah, they should totally
go to Jew church and...

348
00:15:11,065 --> 00:15:12,599
and wear those hats and...

349
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:14,885
and eat that salty orange
stuff with their bagels.

350
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:23,293
Let's lay down on the bed.

351
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:24,411
Okay.

352
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,884
{whispers}:
Finn...

353
00:15:30,969 --> 00:15:32,753
I'd like to give you something

354
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,472
in exchange
for what you gave me.

355
00:15:40,094 --> 00:15:41,878
¶¶  ¶¶ 

356
00:15:51,072 --> 00:15:53,273
{whispers}:
Thank you, Grilled Cheesus.

357
00:15:53,358 --> 00:15:55,826
I need to know what's going on
with that Glee Club.

358
00:15:55,893 --> 00:15:57,560
Brittany, Jugs the Clown, go.

359
00:15:57,612 --> 00:15:59,062
Mostly just everyone's
really sad

360
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:01,198
for Kurt, and no one
really knows how to help.

361
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:03,033
I made him a card
that said "Heart attacks

362
00:16:03,084 --> 00:16:04,434
are just from
loving too much."

363
00:16:04,502 --> 00:16:05,619
Schusters
still pushing

364
00:16:05,687 --> 00:16:07,754
the Lil' Jeezy?
I guess so.

365
00:16:07,822 --> 00:16:10,374
Although I don't really see
what the big deal is.

366
00:16:10,425 --> 00:16:11,925
But Kurt's
definitely not into it.

367
00:16:11,993 --> 00:16:14,428
How's your father?

368
00:16:14,512 --> 00:16:16,746
They say his condition
is critical

369
00:16:16,798 --> 00:16:17,848
but stable.

370
00:16:17,915 --> 00:16:19,099
Good news, I guess.

371
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:20,717
I'm sorry for what you're
going through, Lady.

372
00:16:20,768 --> 00:16:22,319
I wouldn't wish it
on my worst enemy.

373
00:16:22,387 --> 00:16:24,805
And I guess I don't have to--
I think Mary Lou Retton's,

374
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:26,440
like, an orphan or something.

375
00:16:26,524 --> 00:16:27,975
I don't like

376
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:29,643
what Schusters doing
in that classroom

377
00:16:29,727 --> 00:16:30,894
even more than usual.

378
00:16:30,945 --> 00:16:32,929
But I can't go
to the school board

379
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:34,715
without an official complaint
from a student.

380
00:16:36,034 --> 00:16:38,485
So you want me
to be your scapegoat?

381
00:16:38,553 --> 00:16:40,804
{quietly}: No.

382
00:16:40,871 --> 00:16:42,556
You don't understand.

383
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,260
I know at times I mess around
with you guys for fun.

384
00:16:46,344 --> 00:16:48,044
I admit it--
it aids digestion.

385
00:16:48,096 --> 00:16:51,047
But I'm not joking here.

386
00:16:53,468 --> 00:16:56,069
I want to be your champion.

387
00:17:01,214 --> 00:17:02,247
What is wrong with you?

388
00:17:02,332 --> 00:17:03,315
I'm sorry, Madame Secretary,

389
00:17:03,383 --> 00:17:04,967
I'm gonna have to call you back.

390
00:17:05,034 --> 00:17:06,335
Love to Bill.

391
00:17:06,402 --> 00:17:08,587
There is a boy
in that Glee Club

392
00:17:08,671 --> 00:17:10,222
that might
lose his father.

393
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,207
How could you get in the way
when the only thing

394
00:17:12,258 --> 00:17:14,510
anybody is trying to do
is give that poor child

395
00:17:14,561 --> 00:17:15,877
just a little bit of comfort?

396
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:17,146
What happened

397
00:17:17,213 --> 00:17:18,397
to you, Sue?

398
00:17:18,481 --> 00:17:20,065
Please tell me
what horrible, horrible thing

399
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,351
happened to you that made you
such a miserable tyrant?

400
00:17:22,402 --> 00:17:23,602
Have a seat.

401
00:17:25,021 --> 00:17:26,855
Since I was
a little girl,

402
00:17:26,906 --> 00:17:28,107
I've had exactly

403
00:17:28,191 --> 00:17:30,442
one hero.

404
00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:32,111
My big sister.

405
00:17:32,195 --> 00:17:34,196
You know how much
I worshipped her?

406
00:17:34,247 --> 00:17:38,000
She was the sun
and the moon to me.

407
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:40,502
And while I was
still very young,

408
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,372
I noticed that other people
didn't feel the way I did.

409
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,207
People were rude to her.

410
00:17:45,258 --> 00:17:47,292
They were cruel.

411
00:17:47,377 --> 00:17:49,178
They laughed at her.

412
00:17:49,245 --> 00:17:51,430
And so I began to pray.

413
00:17:51,514 --> 00:17:53,782
I prayed every night
for her to get better.

414
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,001
And nothing changed.

415
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,605
So I prayed harder.

416
00:18:01,808 --> 00:18:05,144
And after a while I realized
it wasn't that I wasn't praying

417
00:18:05,228 --> 00:18:07,095
hard enough...

418
00:18:07,147 --> 00:18:08,981
it's that no one was listening.

419
00:18:10,967 --> 00:18:15,154
Asking someone to believe
in a fantasy...

420
00:18:15,238 --> 00:18:18,607
however comforting,
isn't a moral thing to do.

421
00:18:18,675 --> 00:18:20,125
It's cruel.

422
00:18:20,193 --> 00:18:23,412
Don't you think that's
just a little bit arrogant?

423
00:18:23,463 --> 00:18:25,714
It's as arrogant as telling
someone how to believe in God,

424
00:18:25,781 --> 00:18:28,383
and if they don't accept it,
no matter how openhearted

425
00:18:28,451 --> 00:18:32,237
or honest their dissent,
they're going to hell.

426
00:18:32,305 --> 00:18:34,306
Well, that doesn't sound
very Christian, does it?

427
00:18:34,374 --> 00:18:36,725
Well, if that's what
you believe, that's fine.

428
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:38,477
But please keep it to yourself.

429
00:18:38,561 --> 00:18:40,562
So long as you do the same.

430
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,148
That kid could lose
his father at any moment.

431
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:45,167
You should start
preparing him for that.

432
00:18:45,235 --> 00:18:47,135
Now get the hell
out of my office.

433
00:18:47,187 --> 00:18:49,354
I realize you're only
half orangutan,

434
00:18:49,439 --> 00:18:53,192
but I'm still very allergi
to your lustrous ginger mane.

435
00:18:56,362 --> 00:18:59,081
Last week we were too sexy,
this week we're too religious--

436
00:18:59,148 --> 00:19:01,166
we can't win.
Now I know what
Miley feels like.

437
00:19:01,251 --> 00:19:02,817
The real tragedy here
is that I found

438
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:04,703
the most perfect spiritual song
to sing this week,

439
00:19:04,787 --> 00:19:07,005
and now it's been torn away
from me like Sophie's daughter.

440
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,208
Guys, you can still sing
whatever songs you like

441
00:19:09,292 --> 00:19:11,460
that sum up your feelings
about God, about spirit.

442
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:12,928
You just can't do
it on school time.

443
00:19:12,996 --> 00:19:14,379
I hope you're happy, Kurt.

444
00:19:14,464 --> 00:19:16,181
Having the week of
my life, actually.

445
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:19,017
Guys... back off Kurt, okay?

446
00:19:19,085 --> 00:19:21,136
He had every right
to speak his mind.

447
00:19:21,187 --> 00:19:23,472
Look, Kurt, we're sympathetic
to what you're going through,

448
00:19:23,523 --> 00:19:26,174
but siding with Miss Sylvester
isn't gonna do anyone any good.

449
00:19:26,226 --> 00:19:27,359
It's doing me
some good.

450
00:19:27,443 --> 00:19:28,977
Now I don't have
to sit around

451
00:19:29,028 --> 00:19:30,646
listening to all
you mental patients

452
00:19:30,697 --> 00:19:34,733
talk about how's there's a God
when I know there isn't one.

453
00:19:34,817 --> 00:19:36,818
{school bell rings}

454
00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:39,404
Cheesus, I don't need
to tell you how much you rule.

455
00:19:39,489 --> 00:19:41,690
You've given me everything
I've prayed for,

456
00:19:41,741 --> 00:19:44,243
and it turns out Rachel's boobs
are really awesome.

457
00:19:44,327 --> 00:19:47,129
Anyway, I need another favor,
so, Cheesus...

458
00:19:47,196 --> 00:19:49,665
I pray that I'm
made quarterback again.

459
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:52,084
Sam's a good dude--
I just think that I can deliver

460
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:53,652
your message to the world
more powerfully

461
00:19:53,736 --> 00:19:55,787
if I'm the most popular guy
in the school again.

462
00:19:55,855 --> 00:19:56,972
PUCK:
What are you doing?

463
00:19:57,023 --> 00:19:58,106
Nothing. Eating.

464
00:19:59,742 --> 00:20:03,111
So I pray before I eat now--
what's the big deal?

465
00:20:03,162 --> 00:20:04,830
You're not gonna tell anybody
about this, are you?

466
00:20:04,914 --> 00:20:06,481
No. It's cool.

467
00:20:06,532 --> 00:20:07,916
To tell you the truth,

468
00:20:07,984 --> 00:20:10,502
I actually went to temple
with my nanny yesterday.

469
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:13,939
I know it makes me a wuss,
but I'm bummed about Kurt's dad.

470
00:20:14,007 --> 00:20:15,707
I've kind of been
praying for him.

471
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:17,125
I know how
hard it is

472
00:20:17,176 --> 00:20:19,995
not to have a
father, you know?

473
00:20:20,046 --> 00:20:21,430
What do you pray for?

474
00:20:21,497 --> 00:20:22,814
Yeah. Same stuff.

475
00:20:22,882 --> 00:20:25,300
You burned your grilled cheese.

476
00:20:30,523 --> 00:20:32,240
{slaps arm, winces}

477
00:20:32,308 --> 00:20:34,159
Why are we in the park?
'Cause I don't

478
00:20:34,227 --> 00:20:36,328
want anything coming
between us and God.

479
00:20:36,396 --> 00:20:37,663
And because Yentl
was outside when

480
00:20:37,747 --> 00:20:39,414
she sang this
song in the movie.

481
00:20:39,482 --> 00:20:43,035
I just hope that God
hears this song as
a prayer for Burt Hummel

482
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:45,787
and decides to bring
him back to us.

483
00:20:50,576 --> 00:20:52,177

¶¶  Is filled with voices ¶¶ 

516
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,643
¶¶  I remember everything
you taught me ¶¶ 

517
00:23:04,727 --> 00:23:12,300
¶¶  Every book I've ever read... ¶¶ 

518
00:23:12,351 --> 00:23:14,636
¶¶  Can all the words
in all the books ¶¶ 

519
00:23:14,687 --> 00:23:18,907
¶¶  Help me to face
what lies ahead? ¶¶ 

520
00:23:18,974 --> 00:23:22,494
¶¶  The trees are so much taller ¶¶ 

521
00:23:22,562 --> 00:23:26,164
¶¶  And I feel so much smaller ¶¶ 

522
00:23:26,249 --> 00:23:29,000
¶¶  The moon is twice as lonely ¶¶ 

523
00:23:29,085 --> 00:23:30,519
¶¶  And the stars are ¶¶ 

524
00:23:30,586 --> 00:23:34,206
¶¶  Half as bright ¶¶ 

525
00:23:36,442 --> 00:23:40,712
¶¶  Papa, how Love you ¶¶ 

526
00:23:40,796 --> 00:23:45,133
¶¶  Papa, how I need you ¶¶ 

527
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:51,005
¶¶  Papa, how I miss you ¶¶ 

528
00:23:51,057 --> 00:23:57,178
¶¶  Kissing me ¶¶ 

529
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:09,241
¶¶  Good night... ¶¶ 

530
00:24:09,308 --> 00:24:12,711
{monitor beeping}

531
00:24:12,795 --> 00:24:14,746
Who's next?

532
00:24:14,814 --> 00:24:17,098
What's going on in here?

533
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:19,467
We-We were just praying
for your dad.

534
00:24:19,535 --> 00:24:21,703
MERCEDES: Rachel, Quinn, and I
are taking turns.

535
00:24:21,771 --> 00:24:23,622
We're from different
denominations and religions,

536
00:24:23,689 --> 00:24:25,507
so we figured one of us
is bound to be right.

537
00:24:25,575 --> 00:24:27,792
I didn't ask you to do this.

538
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,245
Honey, I know you're upset about
what's happening, I get it,

539
00:24:30,313 --> 00:24:33,164
but friends help out,
even when you don't ask.

540
00:24:33,232 --> 00:24:35,467
Mr. Kurt Hummel?

541
00:24:35,535 --> 00:24:37,402
Dude, why didn't you just tell
us you wanted to pray in Muslim?

542
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:40,171
I'm not Muslim, I'm a Sikh.

543
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:42,157
She's going to see
if acupuncture will improve

544
00:24:42,224 --> 00:24:44,993
the circulation
to my dad's brain.

545
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:48,947
Amazingly, needles pierce
the skin better than psalms.

546
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:50,582
Can you all please leave now?

547
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,121
We just wanted
to do something.

548
00:25:10,415 --> 00:25:11,415
SAM:
Red 42 on three.

549
00:25:11,466 --> 00:25:12,349
ALL:
Break.

550
00:25:12,417 --> 00:25:15,252
Wait.

551
00:25:15,303 --> 00:25:17,137
That cornerback's been cheating
right all night.

552
00:25:17,222 --> 00:25:18,422
We should naked bootleg left.

553
00:25:18,473 --> 00:25:19,723
That ogre linebacker's
on the left.

554
00:25:19,774 --> 00:25:20,941
He's been killing me all game.

555
00:25:21,026 --> 00:25:22,476
Dude, trust me, I'm the only guy

556
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,278
who's ever actually won
a game on this field.

557
00:25:24,362 --> 00:25:25,595
{laughter}

558
00:25:25,647 --> 00:25:30,600
Okay, naked bootleg left,
I keep on three.

559
00:25:30,652 --> 00:25:31,768
All right,
you ready?
ALL:
Break.

560
00:25:33,571 --> 00:25:35,406
That's not what I called.

561
00:25:37,075 --> 00:25:38,542
Yah! Hike!

562
00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:40,044
{grunting}

563
00:25:50,555 --> 00:25:51,955
Is he okay?
His shoulder's
dislocated.

564
00:25:52,007 --> 00:25:53,123
This is
what happens

565
00:25:53,174 --> 00:25:54,975
when you change my plays
in the huddle.

566
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,927
SAM:
I don't understand, that
guy came out of nowhere.

567
00:25:56,995 --> 00:25:58,946
BEISTE:
I know, that kid's been
cheating right all night.

568
00:25:59,014 --> 00:26:00,147
No reason for
him to be there.

569
00:26:00,231 --> 00:26:01,631
It's just bad luck.

570
00:26:01,683 --> 00:26:04,518
We need to get him
to the E.R.
Okay, let's go.

571
00:26:04,602 --> 00:26:06,303
It's in your
hands now, Lurch.

572
00:26:06,354 --> 00:26:08,305
Congratulations, you're
the quarterback again.

573
00:26:15,146 --> 00:26:16,447
I know things have been
pretty morose

574
00:26:16,498 --> 00:26:17,915
around here this past week,

575
00:26:17,982 --> 00:26:19,483
but I want to celebrate
some good news

576
00:26:19,551 --> 00:26:20,918
for our little family.

577
00:26:20,985 --> 00:26:22,286
Let's hear it for Finn
on getting back

578
00:26:22,337 --> 00:26:23,737
his quarterback job

579
00:26:23,805 --> 00:26:25,289
and leading the Titans to a win

580
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,674
in their second game
of the season.

581
00:26:26,758 --> 00:26:28,959
{applause}

582
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:30,627
Yeah, too bad that Sam kid
had to have his arm

583
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:32,796
basically ripped off for it
to happen, but it's good

584
00:26:32,864 --> 00:26:33,931
to have you back
in the saddle, brother.

585
00:26:36,551 --> 00:26:38,218
Mr. Shue, if I may?

586
00:26:38,303 --> 00:26:39,803
Yeah.

587
00:26:39,854 --> 00:26:43,474
Um, I wanted to thank everyone
for your kind e-mails

588
00:26:43,525 --> 00:26:45,609
and queries
about my dad,

589
00:26:45,676 --> 00:26:49,263
but for your information, his
condition mains the same.

590
00:26:51,182 --> 00:26:54,485
I need to express myself,
so with your permission,

591
00:26:54,536 --> 00:26:57,287
Mr. Shue, I've prepared
a number for the occasion.

592
00:26:57,355 --> 00:26:59,356
WILL:
Of course, Kurt.

593
00:26:59,407 --> 00:27:01,959
On the day of my mom's funeral,

594
00:27:02,026 --> 00:27:06,947
when they were lowering her body
into the ground, I was crying.

595
00:27:07,015 --> 00:27:08,966
I mean,
that was it.

596
00:27:09,033 --> 00:27:12,052
It was the last time
I was ever going to see her,

597
00:27:12,137 --> 00:27:13,971
and I remember
I looked up at my dad

598
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:17,591
and I, I just wanted him
to say something,

599
00:27:17,675 --> 00:27:22,646
just something to make me feel
like my whole world wasn't over,

600
00:27:22,714 --> 00:27:26,183
and he just took my hand
and squeezed it.

601
00:27:28,186 --> 00:27:30,721
And just knowing
that those hands were there

602
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:35,125
to take care of me...
that was enough.

603
00:27:35,193 --> 00:27:37,277
This is for my dad.

604
00:27:37,345 --> 00:27:41,331
¶¶  Yeah, I'll ¶¶ 

605
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:45,836

606
00:27:45,903 --> 00:27:51,458
¶¶  I think you'll understand ¶¶

00:27:51,543 --> 00:27:55,129
¶¶  When I say ¶¶ 

608
00:27:55,213 --> 00:27:58,632
¶¶  That something ¶¶ 

609
00:27:58,716 --> 00:28:00,717
¶¶  I want to hold ¶¶

¶¶  Your hand ¶¶ 

613
00:28:11,813 --> 00:28:16,700
¶¶  I want to hold your hand ¶¶ 

614
00:28:16,767 --> 00:28:20,537
¶¶  Oh, please ¶¶ 

615
00:28:20,605 --> 00:28:24,324
¶¶  Say to me ¶¶ 

616
00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:28,945
¶¶  You'll let me be your man ¶¶ 

617
00:28:28,997 --> 00:28:31,715
¶¶  And please ¶¶ 

618
00:28:31,782 --> 00:28:35,369
¶¶  Say to me ¶¶ 

619
00:28:36,805 --> 00:28:38,889
¶¶  You'll let me hold ¶¶ 

620
00:28:38,956 --> 00:28:42,810
¶¶  Your hand ¶¶ 

621
00:28:42,894 --> 00:28:44,812
¶¶  Now let me hold ¶¶ 

622
00:28:44,896 --> 00:28:48,798
¶¶  Your hand ¶¶ 

623
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:51,351
¶¶  I want to hold ¶¶ 

624
00:28:51,436 --> 00:28:54,188
¶¶  Your hand ¶¶ 

625
00:28:55,473 --> 00:28:59,476
¶¶  And when I touch you ¶¶ 

626
00:28:59,527 --> 00:29:03,363
¶¶  I feel happy ¶¶ 

627
00:29:03,448 --> 00:29:05,999
¶¶  Inside ¶¶ 

628
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:10,654
¶¶  It's such a feeling ¶¶ 

629
00:29:10,705 --> 00:29:15,175
¶¶  That my love ¶¶ 

630
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,212
¶¶  I can't hide ¶¶

00:29:18,296 --> 00:29:20,280
¶¶  I can't hide ¶¶ 

632
00:29:20,365 --> 00:29:21,782
¶¶  I can't ¶¶ 

633
00:29:21,866 --> 00:29:27,704
¶¶  Hide... ¶¶

00:29:27,772 --> 00:29:30,791
¶¶  Yeah, you ¶¶ 

635
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:33,794
¶¶  Got that something ¶¶ 

636
00:29:35,213 --> 00:29:37,164
¶¶  I want to hold ¶¶ 

637
00:29:37,232 --> 00:29:41,084
¶¶  Your hand ¶¶ 

638
00:29:41,135 --> 00:29:43,086
¶¶  I want to hold ¶¶ 

639
00:29:43,137 --> 00:29:47,123
¶¶  Your hand ¶¶ 

640
00:29:47,175 --> 00:29:49,426

¶¶  Your hand. ¶¶

{sobbing}

645
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,443
{school bell ringing}

646
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,664
Kurt, can I talk
to you for a second?

647
00:30:14,852 --> 00:30:17,354
I know you're going through a
really scary time right now,

648
00:30:17,422 --> 00:30:21,174
but I feel like I don't know
how to be around you anymore,

649
00:30:21,259 --> 00:30:24,595
and I know you're not really
spiritual or whatever,

650
00:30:24,662 --> 00:30:26,897
but I feel like you're
closing yourself to a world

651
00:30:26,965 --> 00:30:28,465
of experiences that
might surprise you.

652
00:30:30,652 --> 00:30:33,437
You're right.

653
00:30:33,488 --> 00:30:34,521
I'm sorry.

654
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,641
I shouldn't be pushing
my friends away,

655
00:30:37,709 --> 00:30:40,810
especially friends
as fabulous as you.

656
00:30:41,996 --> 00:30:45,565
Do me a favor-- one thing.

657
00:30:45,633 --> 00:30:47,901
Come to church with
me this Sunday.

658
00:30:47,969 --> 00:30:49,136
Our church does
this thing

659
00:30:49,203 --> 00:30:51,204
where we dedicate the
service to someone,

660
00:30:51,289 --> 00:30:54,741
and I got them to dedicate
this Sunday to your dad.

661
00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:56,927
I don't know.
You get to wear

662
00:30:56,995 --> 00:30:58,161
a fabulous hat.

663
00:31:01,382 --> 00:31:04,551
Mercedes, you had me
at "fabulous hat."

664
00:31:04,636 --> 00:31:05,552
{laughs}

665
00:31:05,637 --> 00:31:06,887
Come on, let's go to class.

666
00:31:06,971 --> 00:31:08,855
<i>{school bell ringing}</i>

667
00:31:12,447 --> 00:31:13,897
I have to confess something.

668
00:31:13,949 --> 00:31:15,866
I'm the reason Sam got hurt.

669
00:31:15,934 --> 00:31:17,651
I asked for three
things to happen--

670
00:31:17,719 --> 00:31:20,120
one, for us to win our
first football game,

671
00:31:20,205 --> 00:31:22,239
two, to get to second base
with Rachel, and three,

672
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,291
to be the quarterback on
the football team again.

673
00:31:24,376 --> 00:31:26,510
All those three things happened
because I prayed for them

674
00:31:26,577 --> 00:31:28,429
to Grilled Cheesus.

675
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:31,999
Okay.

676
00:31:32,067 --> 00:31:34,852
Where to start?
No, no, I know it sounds
crazy, but it isn't.

677
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:36,470
Jesus appeared to
me on a sandwich

678
00:31:36,554 --> 00:31:38,472
and it has special
powers, I'm telling you,

679
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,140
but I didn't mean for
anybody to get hurt.

680
00:31:40,225 --> 00:31:42,192
Okay, let's just--
let's take a second.

681
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,978
Okay?
Um...

682
00:31:44,062 --> 00:31:47,531
look, first, you won
the football game

683
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:48,816
because you actually
have a coach

684
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,317
who spends the game
watching the plays

685
00:31:50,402 --> 00:31:51,652
rather than biting
his toenails.

686
00:31:51,736 --> 00:31:55,823
And God didn't let you
touch Rachel's boobs.

687
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,291
Rachel did.

688
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:59,710
Just the sides of them, but
wait, why would she do that?

689
00:31:59,777 --> 00:32:02,079
Well, what were you
doing right before you
were touching them?

690
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,448
What?
I remember yawning.

691
00:32:04,516 --> 00:32:06,950
Right, 'cause we were talking
about emotional stuff.

692
00:32:07,002 --> 00:32:09,219
Oh, yes, well,
there you go, that's it.

693
00:32:09,287 --> 00:32:10,620
Girls like that.

694
00:32:10,672 --> 00:32:13,290
She felt close to you, thus
the inappropriate touching.

695
00:32:13,341 --> 00:32:17,294
Uh, more importantly,
you didn't hurt Sam.

696
00:32:17,345 --> 00:32:19,697
It was a 300-pound left tackle
who just got expelled

697
00:32:19,748 --> 00:32:23,534
because he's on steroids
and he's 23.

698
00:32:23,585 --> 00:32:27,054
God works in all kinds
of mysterious ways,

699
00:32:27,122 --> 00:32:29,840
but I'm pretty sure
he doesn't spend a lot of time

700
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:33,577
trying to speak to us
through sandwiches.

701
00:32:34,696 --> 00:32:36,847
You look disappointed.

702
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:38,966
I am.

703
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,250
It was sort of cool

704
00:32:40,318 --> 00:32:43,637
feeling like I had this
direct line to God.

705
00:32:43,722 --> 00:32:44,938
Now I just feel

706
00:32:45,023 --> 00:32:47,858
like everybody
else, you know,

707
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:51,595
like we're all just
floating around in space.

708
00:32:51,646 --> 00:32:52,613
I don't like that.

709
00:32:52,697 --> 00:32:54,031
You're not alone.

710
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:56,984
The big questions are
really big for a reason--

711
00:32:57,068 --> 00:32:59,136
they're hard.

712
00:32:59,204 --> 00:33:00,270
But you know what?

713
00:33:00,338 --> 00:33:02,856
Absolutely everybody
struggles with them.

{song ends}

735
00:34:40,004 --> 00:34:41,722
I thought we couldn't
sing songs about religion.

736
00:34:43,174 --> 00:34:45,058
Evidently,
we can't sing about faith,

737
00:34:45,143 --> 00:34:47,094
but we can sing
about losing faith?

738
00:34:47,178 --> 00:34:49,263
That's sort of what I
want to talk about today.

739
00:34:49,347 --> 00:34:50,931
Well, earlier in the week, Finn,

740
00:34:51,015 --> 00:34:52,850
it seemed like
you felt differently.

741
00:34:52,917 --> 00:34:56,236
Well, I used to think God was
up there looking over me.

742
00:34:56,321 --> 00:34:58,272
Now, I'm not so sure.

743
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:03,494
{organ plays}

744
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:05,445
I'm very impressed
with everyone's Sunday best.

745
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:09,082
It's so Christ-chic.

746
00:35:09,167 --> 00:35:11,285
I hope our genuflection
to the great

747
00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:13,420
Spaghetti Monster in the sky
don't take too long.

748
00:35:13,505 --> 00:35:15,539
My Sikh is coming
again today at 2:00

749
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,591
to do more acupuncture
on my dad.

750
00:35:17,675 --> 00:35:19,009
Is it working?

751
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:20,460
Not yet.

752
00:35:20,545 --> 00:35:22,596
Nothing is.

753
00:35:27,852 --> 00:35:30,103
I have to go be
with my choir.

754
00:35:31,523 --> 00:35:33,273
{mutters}: Wait,
don't, don't...

755
00:35:35,727 --> 00:35:36,927
Hi, church.

00:35:36,978 --> 00:35:38,261
ALL:
Hi.

757
00:35:38,313 --> 00:35:40,063
I have a favor
to ask you guys.

758
00:35:40,114 --> 00:35:42,449
My friend Kurt Hummel's dad is
in the hospital.

759
00:35:42,517 --> 00:35:44,701
And it's pretty bad.

760
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:47,938
And I know we have all of
our own worries and troubles,

761
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:49,656
but if we could just
put them aside

762
00:35:49,724 --> 00:35:52,125
and focus all of our prayers
and give them to Burt Hummel,

763
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:54,444
and to my friend Kurt.

764
00:35:54,495 --> 00:35:58,715
I know you don't believe in God,
and you don't believe

765
00:35:58,783 --> 00:36:00,500
in the power of prayer,
and that's okay.

766
00:36:00,585 --> 00:36:01,835
To each his own.

767
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,337
But you've got to believe

768
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:04,888
in something.

769
00:36:04,956 --> 00:36:07,758
Something more than you can
touch, taste or see.

770
00:36:07,809 --> 00:36:10,260
'Cause life is too hard
to go through it alone,

771
00:36:10,328 --> 00:36:11,929
without something to hold onto

772
00:36:11,996 --> 00:36:14,448
and without something
that's sacred.

773
00:36:16,818 --> 00:36:19,102

You're letting me win, Sue.

No, I don't.

821
00:38:49,031 --> 00:38:50,115
Why not?

822
00:38:50,183 --> 00:38:52,200
Because
when we were little girls,

823
00:38:52,285 --> 00:38:55,036
you were perfect in my eyes...

824
00:38:56,806 --> 00:38:59,641
And I watched the world
be cruel to you, so...

825
00:38:59,709 --> 00:39:01,743
God never makes mistakes.

826
00:39:03,212 --> 00:39:05,013
That's what I believe.

827
00:39:08,351 --> 00:39:09,634
You want me
to pray for you, Sue?

828
00:39:09,702 --> 00:39:12,337
Yeah. That would be nice.

829
00:39:17,276 --> 00:39:18,843
I win.

830
00:39:20,963 --> 00:39:22,948

I can't do that.

Mercedes took me to
church on Sunday.

834
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:39,180
It's funny, but when
the choir was singing,

835
00:39:39,248 --> 00:39:42,384
this memory flashed
into my head.

836
00:39:42,451 --> 00:39:46,805
Do you remember our first Friday
night dinner after Mom died?

837
00:39:46,872 --> 00:39:48,807
You tried to
make a chicken.

838
00:39:48,874 --> 00:39:50,976
I guess you
wanted me to feel

839
00:39:51,043 --> 00:39:52,811
like there was
something still normal.

840
00:39:56,215 --> 00:39:58,650
You put it on the table,

841
00:39:58,717 --> 00:40:03,772
and you cut into
it, and it was raw.

842
00:40:03,856 --> 00:40:06,608
{laughs} And we both looked at
each other for a second,

843
00:40:06,676 --> 00:40:08,743
and cracked up
before we remembered

844
00:40:08,811 --> 00:40:11,296
that we weren't
supposed to yet.

845
00:40:15,668 --> 00:40:18,486
I'm sorry about the
other day, Dad.

846
00:40:18,554 --> 00:40:20,855
I should have let those
guys pray for you.

847
00:40:20,923 --> 00:40:23,341
It wasn't about me.

848
00:40:23,409 --> 00:40:27,295
It was about you,
and... it was nice.

{monitor beeping}

850
00:40:33,202 --> 00:40:35,086
I don't believe in God, Dad.

851
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:40,125
But I believe in you.

852
00:40:43,946 --> 00:40:45,780
And I believe in us.

00:40:48,284 --> 00:40:50,685
You and me--

00:40:50,753 --> 00:40:53,071
that's what's sacred to me.

00:40:56,108 --> 00:40:58,076
And I am...

856
00:41:03,332 --> 00:41:06,668
I'm so sorry that I never
got to tell you that.

857
00:41:10,122 --> 00:41:11,990
{sniffles and sobs}

858
00:41:19,148 --> 00:41:20,982
Dad?

859
00:41:23,069 --> 00:41:24,819
Nurse Nancy!

860
00:41:26,939 --> 00:41:29,074
Dad, I'm right here.

861
00:41:29,141 --> 00:41:31,142
I'm not going anywhere.

862
00:41:31,193 --> 00:41:35,163
{"One of Us" begins}

863
00:41:35,231 --> 00:41:40,785
¶¶  If God had a name
what it would it be? ¶¶ 

864
00:41:40,836 --> 00:41:44,339
¶¶  And would you call it
to his face ¶¶ 

865
00:41:44,423 --> 00:41:50,161
¶¶  If you were faced with him
in all his glory? ¶¶ 

866
00:41:50,212 --> 00:41:57,835
¶¶  What would you ask
if you had just one question? ¶¶ 

867
00:41:57,887 --> 00:42:02,724
¶¶  And yeah, yeah,
God is great ¶¶ 

868
00:42:02,808 --> 00:42:06,177
¶¶  Yeah, yeah ¶¶ 

869
00:42:06,228 --> 00:42:08,279
¶¶  God is good ¶¶ 

870
00:42:08,347 --> 00:42:10,865
¶¶  Yeah, yeah ¶¶ 

871
00:42:10,933 --> 00:42:14,069
¶¶  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ¶¶ 

872
00:42:14,153 --> 00:42:16,237
¶¶  What if God was one of us? ¶¶ 

873
00:42:16,322 --> 00:42:17,455
<i>¶¶  One of us ¶¶ </i>

874
00:42:17,523 --> 00:42:19,324
<i>¶¶  Was one of us ¶¶ </i>

875
00:42:19,375 --> 00:42:21,960
¶¶  Oh, just a slob
like one of us? ¶¶ 

876
00:42:22,027 --> 00:42:24,579
<i>¶¶  Just a slob
like one of us ¶¶ </i>

877
00:42:24,663 --> 00:42:28,032
¶¶  Just a stranger on the bus ¶¶ 

878
00:42:28,084 --> 00:42:30,168
¶¶  Trying to make his way home ¶¶ 

879
00:42:30,219 --> 00:42:33,204
<i>¶¶  Trying to make
his way home ¶¶ </i>

880
00:42:33,255 --> 00:42:36,641
¶¶  Just trying to make
his way home ¶¶ 

881
00:42:36,708 --> 00:42:38,560
<i>¶¶  Trying to find
his way home ¶¶ </i>

882
00:42:38,644 --> 00:42:42,147
¶¶  Just trying
to make his way home... ¶¶ 

883
00:42:42,214 --> 00:42:46,401
The kids really wanted to do
this song, Sue, so I let 'em.

884
00:42:46,469 --> 00:42:48,686
You gonna get me fired?

885
00:42:48,754 --> 00:42:52,090
Report me?

886
00:42:52,158 --> 00:42:53,658
No.
