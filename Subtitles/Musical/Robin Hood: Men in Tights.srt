[German Accent]
Hurry up, mein lady!

362
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,494
You better get out
of that tub...

363
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:59,330
before that thing
begins to rust.

364
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,791
All right, Broomhilde.

365
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:08,214
Hurry, hurry.
It's freezing.

366
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,764
Button up.
You're going to catch
your death of cold.

367
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,893
Oh, these castles
are so drafty.

Oh, Broomhilde, look.

372
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:33,489

374
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,205
Hello.

375
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:45,835
Ah. This means
I must make a wish.

376
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,588
I hope against hope,

377
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,798
I wish against wish...

378
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:54,928
that the heavens bring me
a kind, wonderful, gentle man...

379
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:58,139
who possesses the key
to my...

380

heart.

381
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,812
Good-bye,
my little friend.

Ooh, that happy
little bluebird...

383
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:11,236
has left a happy
little doo-doo on your hand.

00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:29,003
Prince John,
I must speak with you.

387
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:32,674
All right, everybody.
Later, later.

388
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,301
See you later.
Oh!

389
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,183
Sire.

390
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:44,185
I have news.

391
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,896
What sort of news
do you have?

392
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:49,899
Not bad news, is it?
You know I can't take
bad news.

393
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:54,362
The day started out so good.
Had a good night's sleep.
Had a good B.M.

394
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,614
I don't want to hear
any bad news.

395
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:58,700
Now, what type
of news is it?

396
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:01,786
Well, to be perfectly frank,
it's bad!

397
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,872
I knew it!
[Goblet Clatters]

398
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:08,376
I knew it was bad news!
[Sighs]

399
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,006
Wait a minute.
I have an idea.

400
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:17,802
Maybe if you tell me
the bad news in a good way,
it won't sound so bad.

401
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:22,473
The bad— The bad news
in a good way?

402
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:25,476
Yes, I can do that.
Bad news in a good way.

403
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,478
Um— Well, here goes.

Wait till you hear this.
I just bumped into
Robin of Loxley.

407
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,905
He's back from the Crusades.
[Laughing]

408
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:42,493
You know,
he just beat the crap
out of me and my men.

[Laughing]

410
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:49,167

and he loves
your brother Richard.

He wants to
see you hanged!

You-
[Snorting]

415
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:06,851

We're in an awful lot
of trouble!

[Guffawing]

417
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:13,107
What, are you crazy?

418
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:16,527
Why are you laughing?
This is terrible news!

419
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:19,364
Well, I-l-
You-You told me-

420
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:21,616
I was just trying
to soften the blow.

421
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,369
Well, you blew it.

422
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,788
This is a knotty problem,
sire, not easily solved.

423
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,790
Yes, you're right.

424
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,043
What to do?

425
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:35,213
What to do?
What to do?

426
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:39,217
Got it! Latrine!

427
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,093
The weird creature
in the tower, the one
who protects my future.

428
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:43,471
The weird creature
in the tower, the one
who protects my future.

429
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,973
Oh, yes, Latrine.
[Shuddering]

430
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,934
Is she ugly!

where are you?
I must talk with you!

No!

00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:02,657
Oh, it's you.
There's a new threat
to my power.

435
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:06,494
What can you tell me
about Robin of Loxley?

436
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,664
Robin of Loxley?
Robin of Loxley.

437
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,833
Let me see.

438
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:16,003
Raven's egg,

439
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,339
blood of a hen!

440
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:20,299
Little bit more blood,
yes.

441
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,679

Eyeballs of a crocodile.

[Chuckling]

443
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,350
Testicles of a newt.

00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:32,437
I guess he's
a transsexual now!

00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:35,273
Yeah. Ugh.
Yes.

Mmm!
[Sizzling]

447
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:47,368
Robin of Loxley
is handsome and brave.

448
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:51,205
He seeks to regain
his family's honor.

449
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,417
The little sod
could be trouble.

450
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,419
Are you certain?
Certain?

451
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,755
You want certain,
hire yourself a witch.
I'm just your cook.

452
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,467
Here. Eat this.

453
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:05,887
Hmm, looks fabulous.

454
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:08,890
Looks like a seder
at Vincent Price's house.

455
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:20,318
Such an unusual name, Latrine.
How did your family
come by it?

456
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,987
We changed it
in the ninth century.

457
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,698
You mean,
you changed it...

458
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,992
to Latrine?

459
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,453
Yeah.
Used to be Shithouse.

460
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,582
It's a good change.

461
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,668
It's a good change.

462
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:41,631
Now, what about
this Robin fellow, huh?

463
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:44,091
How can I stop him?

464
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,928
Maybe I could devise...

465
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:48,930
a magic potion,

466
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:52,600
one that would make him
unable to perform
the slightest task.

467
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:57,021
But in return,
you must help me.

468
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:01,275
What, are you kidding?
Name it. Anything you want.

469
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,071
Put in a good word
for me with the sheriff
of Rottingham.

470
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:07,573
I've got the hots for him.

471
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,202
[Sighs]
Hmm.

472
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:14,664
I keep a likeness of him
in my boudoir.

473
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:16,916
Oh. Ohh!

474
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,460
Oh! Oh, Rotty!

475
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:22,380
Rotty, Rotty, Rotty!

476
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:24,507
I am amazed,

477
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,635
to think that a handsome
blade like the sheriff
of Rottingham...

478
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,596
would ever want
a creature like you.

479
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:32,640
[Sniffs]

480
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:36,269
Well, if you’re gonna
puncture my dreams,

481
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:39,063
you can forget about
my promise to help you.

482
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:42,817
No, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

483
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,819
Wait.

484
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,446
Maybe if we
got him drunk.

485
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,161
Very drunk.

486
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,163
You got a shot.

Ooh, good!

490
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,226
Whoa.

491
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,315
Dismount.

492
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,281
Wait here.
I'll go make sure
it's safe.

493
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:52,345
I say, would you mind,
um, awfully,
getting out of the way?

494
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:56,223
I say, not until
you pay the toll.

495
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,434
Toll? What toll?

496
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:02,229
Well, the toll you pay
for crossing me bridge.

497
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,231
I'm not paying
any toll.

498
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,901
This bridge is
on my family's land.

499
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,903
Well, it used to be
my family's land.

500
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:12,448
Hey. Hey, you're—
you're Robin of Loxley!

501

[Laughing]
Hey!

502
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,827
[Laughing Continues]
Yeah!

503
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,829
And who might you be?

504
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:21,082
Oh, they call me
Little John.

505
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,584
Uh, but don't let
my name fool you.

506
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:26,545
In real life,
I'm very big.

507
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,840
I'll take your word for it.
Now let me pass.

508
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:32,426
Uh- No.

509
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,722
Sorry,
but a toll is a toll,

510
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:38,724
and a roll is a roll,

511
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:42,186
and if we don't get no tolls,
then we don't eat no rolls.

512
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,606
I made that up.

513
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:49,193
It's very fascinating.
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to hurt you.

514
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:52,822
Oh, yeah. My pleasure.
Will!

515
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,123
Thank you.

516
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:04,208
Hey, Blinkin.

517
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,335
Did you say,
"Abe Lincoln"?

518
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,630
No, I ain't
say Abe Lincoln!
I said, "Hey, Blinkin."

519
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:11,632
Hold the reins, man.

520
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:15,344
Damn.

521
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,472
Hey, Robin, Robin.

522
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,683
Excuse me.
No, excuse me.

523
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,227
Hey, look, man.
You don't have to do this.

524
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:27,815
Look, this ain't exactly
the Mississippi.

525

I'm on one side, see?
I'm on the other side.

526
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:35,156
I'm on the east bank.
I'm on the west bank.

527
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,950
It is not that critical.

528
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:41,537
Not the point.
It's the principle
of the thing.

529
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,664
Yeah.

530
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,084

That's my name, man.

Ahchoo.

00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,722
Here, let me introduce you
to my best friend,
Will Scarlet.

559
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:06,932
Scarlet's my middle name.

560

Will Scarlet O'Hara.

We're from Georgia.

562
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,693
He's deadly
with his daggers.

563
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,487
Really? How's about
a demonstration?

564
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,531
Gladly.

565
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,169
All right then.

566
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:38,756
Fire an arrow
straight at my heart.

567
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:43,135
- Are you serious?
- Absolutely.

568
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:51,810
Okay. Good-bye.

569
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:01,862
Hey, what part of Georgia
are you from?

570
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:03,822
South Central?

572
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:16,001
Well, I haven't quite
figured that part out yet.

00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:20,214
I see.

574
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,050
I'm sorry 'bout
the toll thing, Robin.

575
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,052
I mean,
it's Prince John.

576
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,638
He's taken our homes
and everything we own.

577
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:31,684
We've nothin' left.
Not to worry,
Little John.

578
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:35,688
Even as we speak, I'm forming
a plan to make trouble for
Prince John and Rottingham.

579
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:38,774
Tonight,
I'll crash their party
and serve warning...

580
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,527
that there are those who
will fight to rid England
of their tyranny.

581
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,822
Good! We'll join you!
[Together]
Yeah!

582
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:47,616
No, no, no, no.
I can't risk the lives
of others.

583
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:51,453
One man can
get in more easily
than half a dozen.

584
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:53,914
Well, I must be off.

585
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:56,750
Fare thee well.
I'll see thee
upon my return.

586
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,253
All right, man.
Peace, bro.

587
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,464
Take it easy.
Thanks.

Ah. Here you are, son.

591
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,525
Your ticket, sir.

[Yawns]

593
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,480
Kill him!

594
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,400
No, wait.

595
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:07,154
You know, a mime...
is a terrible thing
to waste.

596
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,533
Let him go.

597
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,583

Good evening, milady.

Maid Marian, you know
our good sheriff
of Rottingham.

601
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:35,933
You look ravishing,

Mmm.

605
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:56,954
I must say that Prince John
has spared no expense
for tonight's party.

606
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:59,957
We have exotic foods
from across the seas.

607
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:03,502
Coconuts, bananas
and dates.

608
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,838
Would you care
for a date?
Yes, thank you.

609
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:08,715
How 'bout
next Thursday?

610
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,389
Good evening.

611
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,933
That's-
That's him!

612
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:21,520

A present for you
and your guests.

617
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:46,503
That's a wild boar.

618
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:50,048
No, no, that's a wild pig.
That's a wild bore.

about you.

- And you are?
- Maid Marian.

625
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,904
Ah, Maid Marian.

626
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:14,865
Rumors of your beauty
have traveled
far and wide,

627
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:18,493
yet I see they hardly
do you justice.
Oh!

628
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:21,079
Quite a smoothy.

What?
What?

633
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:39,181
I mean, don't you know
it is illegal
to kill a wild pig...

634
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,767
in the king's forest?

635
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:44,937
Is it not also illegal
to sit in the king's throne
and usurp his power...

636
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:47,814
in his absence?
[All Gasping]

637
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:51,151
Careful, Robin.
You go too far.
I've only just begun.

638
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:54,988
I've come to warn you
that if you do not stop
levying these evil taxes,

639
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:59,368
I shall lead
the good people of England
in a revolt against you.

640
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:02,454
And why should the people
listen to you?

641
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:06,166
Because, unlike
some other Robin Hoods,

642
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:09,711
I can speak
with an English accent.

To tell you the truth,
this guy is starting
to get on my nerves!

645
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,220
Worry not, Your Highness.

646
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:22,474
I shall dispose
of this feathered upstart.

647
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:25,686

to a duel.

Whoa!

652
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:46,206
That's going to cost you,
Loxley.

653
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,333
Please,
put it on my bill.

654
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:51,753
So it's come down
to this, has it?
A fight to the death.

00:48:12,932 --> 00:48:15,016
We've got him.
We've got him.

698
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:20,397
Aha! Right rope.

699
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:29,573
[All Grunting]

700
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:45,005
Oh!
[Cheering]

701
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:47,007
Look at this.

702
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:50,677
We went from royalty
to recycling.

703
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,972
Little John,
would you get the door?
Yeah, I'll try.

704
00:48:55,308 --> 00:48:57,559
Well, it's been
a wonderful party,

705
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,894
and we'd love to stay
and all that, but, um,

706
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:02,731
I'm afraid we really
must dash, so ta-ta.

707
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,899
[Grunts]

708
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:07,402
[All Groaning]

709
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,286
No, no, no.

710
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,588
I sent word
throughout England
that each village...

711
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:29,049
should send
the very best men
they have.

712
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,384
These are them.

713
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:38,808
Hmm, we're in
a lot of trouble.

714
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:44,230
Good people who have traveled
from villages near and far,

715
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,232
lend me your ears.

716
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:54,240
That's disgusting.

717
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,493
Hear me!

718
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:59,746
Men the likes of Prince John
and Rottingham must be stopped.
[Muttering Agreement]

719
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:03,333
Stopped from taxing us into
poverty, from taking from us
what is rightfully ours.

720
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,460
[Muttering]

721
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:08,129
If we stand up to them,
all together as one,

722
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:10,465
we can win the day!

723
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:14,302
We shall go on to the end.
We shall not flag or fail.

724
00:50:14,387 --> 00:50:16,805
We shall fight
on the seas and oceans.

725
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:20,433
[Imitating Churchill]
We shall defend our isle,
whatever the cost may be.

726
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:23,478
We shall never surrender.

727
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,438
Then they shall
say of us,

728
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:27,774
"Never have so many...

729
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,527
owed so much to so few."

730
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:33,655
[Snoring]

731
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:36,241
That was beautiful.
What's going on?

732
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:38,201
They're asleep.

733
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:42,747
Hey, man.

734
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:44,958
Tough room.

735
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:49,587
Why don't you let me
give it a try?
Okay.

736
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:52,298
[Snoring Continues]

737
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:01,766
- Look at yourselves!
- [Snorting, Muttering]

738
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:05,520
Go ahead.
Take a look around.

739
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:09,190
- Oh, people of Sherwood,
you been had!
- [Crowd] Yeah!

740
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,192
Hoodwinked!
Yeah!

741
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,236
Bamboozled!
Yeah!

742
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,238
Run amok.

743
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,490
We didn't land
on Sherwood Forest.

744
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:20,243
Sherwood Forest
landed on us!

745
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,953
Yeah!

746
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,955
Very good.

747
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:26,708
They're all warmed up.

748
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:31,004
Brother Ahchoo is right.
And I say we fight back!

749
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:33,256
Yeah!
Yes.

750
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:38,011
- Are you with me,
yea or nay?
- Which one means yes?

751
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:43,016
- Yea.
- [All] Yea!

752
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:46,728
Men, grab your uniforms
and equipment...

753
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,938
and prepare for
the training sequence.

754
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:53,401
All right, gentlemen,
grab your feathered caps,
jerkins, bodkins,

755
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:56,780
boots, swords,
quivers...

756
00:51:56,864 --> 00:51:59,282
and panty hose.

757
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:05,371
Now, men, the object
of this exercise...

758
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:08,082
is to hit the target.

759
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:16,174
[All Gasping]
All right?

760
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,309
Oh!

761
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:29,437
[Grunting]

762
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:33,024
Hmm!

763
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,777
[Grunts]
Oh!

764
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,987
[Grunts]

765
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:40,406
[Man Screams]

766

[Whimpers]

767
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:48,081
Now, men, I want you
to keep your eye on Will...

768
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,083
and do exactly
as he does.

769
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:53,419
Ah-ooh!

770
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:01,553
Yeah!
Very good.
Well done, Will.

771
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:03,805
Right!
All right, Will!

772
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:08,184
That's not so hard.
We could do that.
Piece of cake.

773
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:14,148
Good boy.
Ready, men?

774
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:17,694
Charge!

775
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:22,574
[Shouting]

776
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:25,493
[Grunting, Groaning]

777
00:53:25,578 --> 00:53:28,830
Oh, man.

778
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:32,041
Hey, Rob, man,
maybe we should take
the dummies into battle.

779
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:34,043
Ha!

780
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:38,965
Hmm.

781
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:47,098
Sire?
I must speak with you.

782
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,269
What are you smelling?

783
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:55,565
These aren't my bubbles.
They're from the pipes.

784
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:58,776
Your Majesty,
I have terrible news.
What?

785
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:01,446
"Strucky"
has "loxed" again.

786
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:05,992
What?
Loxley has struck again.

787
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:09,412
[Grunts]
I'm gonna need privacy,
so you guys can blow.

788
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:13,958
Not blow. Blow!

789
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:22,634
I'm so depressed.

790
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:27,013
Your Majesty, come with me,
and I will show you something
that will make you very happy.

791
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:31,100
Fetch the royal robe!
Your Majesty?

792
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:33,895
Stop me if I'm wrong
about this, but...

793
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:38,066
wasn't your mole...
on the other side?

794
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:42,362
I have a mole?

795
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:44,364
What is it?

796
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:47,867
It's what we've named
a stealth catapult.

797
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:51,371
We've been working on it
secretly for months.

798
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:55,667
It can hurl one
of these heavy boulders,
undetected,

799
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:59,629
over a hundred yards,
completely destroying
anything it hits.

800
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:02,548
Wow!
How does it work?
It's quite simple.

801
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:05,718
You just take one of these
heavy rocks, put it here
where I'm sitting,

802
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:07,679
and then pull
on that lever.

803
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:09,931
You mean, like this?
[Screaming]

804
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:12,934
[Screaming Continues]

805
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:15,228
Oh, Dear Lord,

806
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:19,315
if you see fit to send me
my one true love—

807
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:22,318
[Shouts, Grunts]

808
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:24,529
Thank you!

809
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:29,325
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

810
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:32,537
Oh, my God!
Here! Let me work
my magic on you!

811
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:35,581
[Whimpering]
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

812
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:38,292
No, no!
I've got a headache.
I've got a headache.

813
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:41,587
Where are you going?
Oh, bugger!

814
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:43,631
[Sighs]

815
00:55:43,716 --> 00:55:45,675
I was that close.

816
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:49,637
I touched it.

817
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:59,105
I don't like the way
you're walking.

818
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:02,108
You've been into
the sacramental wine again.

819
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:04,193
You're farshnoshket!

820
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:06,779
You drunken mule, you.

821
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:13,911
Whoa, Morris, whoa.

822
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:15,913
Halt there, friend.

823
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:19,000
You’ve just entered
the territory of Robin Hood
and his Merry Men.

824
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:27,383
- Faigelehs?
- [All] No!

825
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:30,678
No, no, no, no.
We're straight,
just merry.

826
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:33,264
Azoy?
And who might you be,

827
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,850
with the exceptionally long
feather in your hat?

828
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:39,270
I am Robin of Loxley.
Robin of Loxley?

829
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:41,647
I've just come
from Maid Marian,

830
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:46,152
the lady whose heart you stole,
you prince of thieves, you.

831
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:52,325
I knew her mother and father
before they were taken
in the plague.

832
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,577
Lord and Lady Bagelle.

833
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:57,330
You were meant
for each other,
you and Maid Marian.

834
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:01,751
What a combination!
Loxley and Bagelle.
You can't miss.

835
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:04,754
And who are you, sir?

836
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:07,006
I am Rabbi Tuckman,

837
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:09,509
purveyor
of sacramental wine...

838
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:12,053
and mohel extraordinaire.

839
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:16,307
- Hello, Rabbi.
- Hello, boys.

840
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:19,185
Mohel. Don't believe
I've ever heard
of that profession.

841
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:23,940
Mohel?
He's a very important guy.
He makes circumcisions.

842
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:27,401
What, pray tell, sir,
is a circumcision?

843
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:31,489
Oh, it's the latest rage.
The ladies love it.
[Will] I want one!

844
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:33,991
I'll take two.
Put me down too.
I'm getting one.

845
00:57:34,118 --> 00:57:37,370
I'm game.
How's it done?
It's a snap.

846
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:40,039
I take my little machine.

847
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,043
I take your
little thing, see?

848
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:46,546
I put it into
this little hole here,

849
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,173
and... nip the tip!

850
00:57:49,258 --> 00:57:51,008
[Groaning]
Ow!

851
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:54,804
- Who's first?
- I changed me mind.

852
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:58,057
I forgot, man.
I already got one.
Christian.

853
00:57:58,142 --> 00:58:00,560
I gotta work with
a much younger crowd.

854
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:03,855
Rabbi, you seem to be
on the side of good.

855
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:06,858
Will you join us
and share with us
some of your wisdom,

856
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:10,528
some of your counsel,
and, uh, perhaps...
some of your wine?

857
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:12,613
[Laughing]

858
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:14,907
Wisdom and counsel,
that's easy.

859
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:19,871
But this is sacramental wine.
It's only used to bless things.

860
00:58:19,955 --> 00:58:22,915
[All Agreeing]

861
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,793
Wait a minute!

862
00:58:25,878 --> 00:58:28,421
There's things here-
there's trees,
there's rocks,

863
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,715
there's birds,
there's squirrels.

864
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:34,218
Come on!
We'll bless them all
until we get farshnoshket!

865
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:37,096
- Join me!

866

Let's hear it
for the rabbi!

00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:53,863
Good evening,
Don Giovanni.
Yeah.

869
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:58,367
Buona sera.
Buona sera.

870
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:01,162
Yes. It was, uh,
very good of you to come
at such short notice.

871
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:04,582
Well.
And all the way
from Jersey.

872
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:07,168
Well, it is
quite a drive.

873
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:12,506
Yes, but you do realize that
Prince John expressly commanded
this to be a secret meeting?

874
00:59:12,591 --> 00:59:15,259
I mean,
who are these men?

875
00:59:15,344 --> 00:59:17,803
These are
my trusted associates.

876
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:20,223
On my right,
Dirty Ezio.

877
00:59:22,935 --> 00:59:27,313
On my left,
Filthy Luca.

878
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:31,692
Now.
We thank you
for inviting us...

879
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:35,613
on the day
of your daughter's wedding.
No, no.

880
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:39,242
I hope her first child
is a masculine child.

881
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:41,911
Shut up. We didn't
even have our meeting yet.

882
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:44,538
Oh, yeah.
[Don Giovanni]
Oh, yeah.

883
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:47,041
[Groans]

884
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,043
All right.

885
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:52,630
I understand that you have
been bothered by this fruit,
Robin Hood.

886
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:55,716
That you want Robin
rubbed out,

887
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:58,594
eliminated,
maybe even killed.

888
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:01,389
Yes.
You put it succinctly.

889
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:05,434
Suck what?
Succinctly.
It means perfectly.

890
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:07,436
Oh, yeah.
Well, I knew that.

891
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:10,439
[Nuts Cracking]

892
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:13,276
Excuse me, Don Giovanni.

893
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,778
Your lizard seems limp.

894
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,907
At my age, you know,
sometimes-

895
01:00:19,992 --> 01:00:22,285
Oh, oh, my lizard.
Oh! No.

896
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:24,787
Nah, he’s just sleeping.
Charlie.

897
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,956
Charlie. Oh, Charlie.

898
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:31,711
Charlie, I could've been
somebody. I could have been
a contender.

899
01:00:31,795 --> 01:00:34,588
You know, Charlie's—
Charlie's got bad breath.

900
01:00:34,673 --> 01:00:36,173
[Lizard Urinating]

901
01:00:36,258 --> 01:00:39,969
Oh! He got excited,
you know.

902
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:42,471
Come over here, Ezio.

903
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:46,100
Uh— Mmm, no.

904
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:50,021
Now, normally
I would be so happy
to be of service to you,

905
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:53,607
but there is something
that weighs very heavily
on my heart.

906
01:00:53,692 --> 01:00:57,445
In the years
that we have been friends,
England and Jersey,

907
01:00:57,529 --> 01:01:01,615
never once have you
invited me to your home
for coffee and cake...

908
01:01:01,742 --> 01:01:05,286
or ganool, something,
you know.
A "guh-what"?

909
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,913
A ganool.
It's a pastry
with stuffing.

910
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:10,374
And it's got sprinkles
on it. Mmm.

911
01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:14,128
Excuse me.
I don't understand
a word you're saying.

912
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:18,382
I just came back
from the dentist,

913
01:01:18,467 --> 01:01:22,720
and they left in
the cotton balls.

914
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:26,265
I will take these cotton balls
from you with my hand...

915
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:29,769
and put them in my pocket.

916
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:35,191
Yeah. Whatever.

917
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:37,443
You know, your other associate
says very little.

918
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:39,779
Well, my other associate
says nothing.
Why is that?

919
01:01:39,863 --> 01:01:43,199
Because my enemy
cut out his tongue.

920
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:45,743
Good grief!
Why?

921
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:49,497
Well, 'cause he went
like this.
[Loud Blubbering]

922
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:52,875
And he didn't like it,
so he cut out his tongue.

923
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,002
Come over here.
Go like this.

924
01:01:55,087 --> 01:01:57,004
[Tongue Clicks]

925
01:01:57,089 --> 01:02:00,299
[Laughs]
He can't do it.

926
01:02:00,384 --> 01:02:04,261
I love to tease him!
[Laughs]

927
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:07,765
Tell me, Don Giovanni.
Yeah, that's me.
What?

928
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,767
What do you intend to do
about Robin Hood?

929
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:11,769
Listen to this.
I got an idea.

930
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:15,773
Tomorrow— Tomorrow you're
gonna have your medieval
fun and games.

931
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:18,901
You'll make
the most important event
the archery contest.

932
01:02:19,027 --> 01:02:22,530
Robin will not be able
to resist.
Why is that?

933
01:02:22,614 --> 01:02:25,491
We'll make him an offer
he can't refuse.

934
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:28,786
I was just gonna say that.

935
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:30,788
That's brilliant!
Thank you.

936
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:32,832
But-
What?

937
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:36,043
You do realize that Robin
is the finest archer
in the land?

938
01:02:36,128 --> 01:02:38,295
Oh, no.
Don't you understand?

939
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:41,173
Luca is good,
better, best.

940
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:44,093
Show him
your archery medals.

941
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:46,095
Ta-da!

942
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:48,514
Wowee!

943
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:51,267
See? I couldn't
have said it better myself.

944
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:55,104
Now, Luca beats Robin
at the archery contest,

945
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:59,942
and then Dirty Ezio
makes Robin no more.

946
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:05,948
No more?
All right, you want
plain English?

947
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:08,576
Robin is gonna be dead.

948
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:12,288
D-E-D. Dead.

949
01:03:12,372 --> 01:03:17,042
[All Laughing]

950
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:23,048
You hear him?
[Imitates Ezio's Laugh]

951
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:25,593
[Laughter Continues]

952
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:36,270
[Gasps]

953
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,902
Broomhilde?
Broomhilde, wake up!

954
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:44,862
There's a foul plot afoot.

955
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:48,199
It's not mine feet.
I just washed them.
No, no, no.

956
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:51,118
Prince John and the sheriff
have hired men to kill Robin.

957
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:53,287
[Gasps]
We must warn him
immediately!

958
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:56,248
Wait, mein lady!
If Prince John should see us-

959
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:59,418
You're right.
We'll go out the back.
Right.

960
01:04:01,922 --> 01:04:03,881
Lady!

961
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:15,267
Broomhilde,
I'm going on ahead.

962
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:18,062
Catch me up.
Come on, Lady.

963
01:04:19,314 --> 01:04:21,899

965
01:04:44,673 --> 01:04:46,632
Ooh.

966
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:54,848
Farfelkugel.
If I was you,

967
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:57,518
I would never
do that again.

968
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:01,564
Any questions?
[Snorts]

969
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:04,233
Good.

970
01:05:07,946 --> 01:05:10,030
Forward!

971
01:05:10,115 --> 01:05:12,032
[Grunting]

972
01:05:25,005 --> 01:05:28,215
Blinkin, what are you
doing up there?

973
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:32,803
Guessing.
I...

974
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:35,931
guess no one's coming.

975
01:05:38,435 --> 01:05:42,605
Please come down from there.
Twit.

976
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:48,319
Well, I guess there's a ladder
around here somewhere.

977
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:51,697
Oh. Here we are.
Right.

978
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:04,460
Oh, shit.

979

[Groans]

980
01:06:18,767 --> 01:06:20,726
I can see!

981
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:30,736
No, I was wrong.

982
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:39,328
[Grunts]

983
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:44,917
Blimey, these are
hard to get on.

984
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:48,837
Let's face it.
You gotta be a man
to wear tights.

985
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:54,009
Will, how are me seams?

986
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:57,846
Perfect.

Darling, what are you
doing here?
I have come to warn you.

1021
01:09:18,947 --> 01:09:22,282
Prince John and Rottingham
have hired murderers to kill
you at the fair tomorrow!

1022
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:24,993
You mustn't go!

1023
01:09:25,078 --> 01:09:28,288
That's easy.
I won't.

Oh, I'm so happy.

1025
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:35,170

to lure you there by having
an archery contest.

1027

is unbeatable.

Really?
Robin, promise
you won't go.

I promise you won't go.
Thank you.

- Cool it.

Sir Robin of Loxley.

Thank you, sir.
Excuse me, King.

1380
01:37:12,702 --> 01:37:17,331
Why, if you like this guy
so much, do you object
to his marrying Maid Marian?

1381
01:37:17,415 --> 01:37:20,751
I have no objections,
but I have not yet
kissed the bride.

1382

It is a custom
and my royal right.

A black sheriff?
