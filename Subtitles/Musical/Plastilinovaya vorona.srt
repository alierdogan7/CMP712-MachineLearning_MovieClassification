Lyrics: Eduard Uspensky

2
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,720
Here is a simple fairy tale,

3
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,520
or <i>maybe</i> not a fairy tale,

4
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,520
or <i>maybe</i> not so simple,

5
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,240
that we'd like to tell you.

6
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,640
We know it from our childhood,

7
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,440
or maybe not from childhood,

8
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,440
perhaps we don't remember it,

9
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,440
but will recall it anyway.

10
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,640
<i>Begin!</i>

11
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,640
There once was a crow,

12
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,440
or possibly a dog,

13
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,440
or possibly a cow,

14
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,960
who struck a lucky score.

15
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,960
Someone sent her some cheese

16
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,960
perhaps about 200 grams

17
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,960
or possibly 300

18
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,960
or maybe half-a-kilo.

19
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,960
She flew right up a fur tree,

20
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,960
or maybe didn't fly there

21
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,560
or maybe up a palmtree

22
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,560
she climbed swiftly up

23
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,560
and there for some breakfast,

24
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,040
or maybe for some dinner,

25
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,760
or maybe even for supper,

26
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,040
she quietly made her plans.

27
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,040
<i>And then?</i>

28
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,040
But here a fox was running,

29
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,040
or maybe wasn't running,

30
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,040
or maybe it was a mean ostrich,

31
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,040
or maybe not mean at all.

32
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,080
Or maybe it was a street sweeper

33
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,760
who walked about the countryside,

34
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,760
to find the nearest hazeltree,

35
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,760
to carve himself a new broom!

36
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,560
Oh listen my dear crow,

37
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,560
or maybe you are a dog,

38
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,480
or possibly a cow

39
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,760
the fairest cow of all,

40
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,560
your feathers are so exquisite,

41
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,760
your horns are really something,

42
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,760
your hooves are slim,

43
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,760
and your soul is kind!

44
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,560
And if ever you should sing,

45
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,760
or maybe if you woof

46
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,360
or maybe if you moo

47
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,040
since that's what cows do

48
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,760
then you'll get a big saddle

49
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,480
a carpet and a TV set,

50
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,880
nice presents will be gotten

51
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,960
or maybe will be got.

52
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,880
And so, the silly crow,

53
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,880
or maybe the dog,

54
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,200
or possibly...

55
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,200
<i>the hippo!</i>

56
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,520
began to sing something...

57
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,240
<i>Cock-a-doodle-doo!</i>

58
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,320
And the cheese of our crow,

59
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,040
or maybe of the dog,

60
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,640
or possibly the cow -

61
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,320
of course fell down.

62
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,360
And right atop the fox

63
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,760
<i>Stop throwing things!</i>

64
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,760
or maybe on the ostrich

65
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,360
or possibly on the sweeper

66
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,360
it fell right down.

67
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,440
The moral of this fairy tale,

68
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,140
which may not be a fairy tale,

69
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,160
will understand not just a grownup

70
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,840
but even a toddler:

71
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,560
Don't stand, don't jump,

72
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,360
don't sing or dance

73
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,040
in construction zones

74
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,240
with suspended heavy loads!

75
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,240
<i>That's all!</i>
