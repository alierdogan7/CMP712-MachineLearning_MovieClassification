1
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,760
Miracle

2
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,680
My name is Dennis P.,
So get out of my way,

3
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,400
Or you'll be in
dead trouble today.

4
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,440
Don't try to "battle",
I don't suffer fools,

5
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,240
In these streets,
I'm the dude "who rules".

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,440
Don't come here
and diss my style,

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,680
Nobody messes
with my hustler profile.

8
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,760
Fuck that! The truth is
I'm not tough though,

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,960
My arms are all skinny
and as white as dough.

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,760
They call me midget,
they say I'll never walk tall.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,960
I have to stand on tiptoe,
to yell at them at all.

12
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,680
But worst of all,
though nobody knows,

13
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,920
I see no pubes,
when I check my hose.

14
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,960
Fuck.

15
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,240
Piss.

16
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,040
Fuck.

17
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,760
Hi, Mum.

18
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,960
Um ... Mum, I was just thinking ...
Tomorrow night, right?

19
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,920
Dennis ... 8 years ago today
your dad danced his last.

20
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,120
Yes, but ... tomorrow is Saturday.

21
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,440
Look. That's your dad.

22
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,560
He danced like an angel.
Just get that smile.

23
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,920
He thought his life lay before him
with trophies and dancing -

24
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,520
- and prizes and gold
and silver ... and gold.

25
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,480
Then all of a sudden the music
stopped forever, Dennis.

26
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,080
Forever.

27
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,720
All he was doing was
fixing the TV aerial.

28
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,240
One false step, Dennis.

29
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,760
Just one, tiny, simple false step
and everything was over.

30
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,320
But you wouldn't remember
anything about it.

31
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,080
- Give us a hug.
- Sure, Mum.

32
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,760
It takes so little.

33
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,800
- We must take care of each other, eh?
- Yes, Mum.

34
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,320
Hi, Mick.

35
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,960
- Why are you coming from there?
- Nice sweatshirt.

36
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,440
I've had it for ages, man.

37
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,600
- Giorgos!
- Hi, lads! See you this afternoon, yes?

38
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,800
Polle's party tomorrow, right?

39
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,880
I'll get the beer from Netto
and hide it in the bike shed.

40
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,480
Half special strength
and half ordinary lager, okay?

41
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,480
Hell! Watch it!

42
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,400
- Or shall we go for rum and coke?
- What?

43
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,720
Listen up, will you?

44
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,720
Your mum says you can go
to Polle's party, right?

45
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,840
- Tomorrow at 8 o'clock.
- Yes, of course.

46
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,520
- Right, what have we got?
- Hi.

47
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,800
- Karen Elise.
- Eh?

48
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,760
- Hi.
- Hi, Karen Elise.

49
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,400
Who've we got ... Sandstrøm.

50
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,800
Fuck.

51
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,000
Good morning ...

52
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,520
... you dwarves in the
kingdom of the mind.

53
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,400
Let us now despair
at the poverty of your talents.

54
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,320
And why not start from the very
bottom? Why not start with ...

55
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,120
Dennis Petersen.

56
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,920
O Dennis Petersen,
my favourite retard!

57
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,320
How would you crack
such a simple equation?

58
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,560
It's all yours.

59
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,720
We are waiting.

60
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,200
Dennis.

61
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,520
<i>As a baby I was bold,
And really profound.</i>

62
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,680
<i>Like the Baby Jesus,
The shepherds found.</i>

63
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,440
<i>As a boy I was
the top of my class.</i>

64
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,200
<i>And so good
I'd any angel surpass</i>

65
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,880
<i>In my teens I was
the school Don Juan</i>

66
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,200
<i>I got up the skirts
of many a maiden.</i>

67
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,560
<i>My smile is like
the sun when it shines.</i>

68
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,760
<i>If she hears my song
any woman reclines.</i>

69
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,960
<i>But Dennis, you're a nothing,</i>

70
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,520
<i>a hole in the ground,
you'll never be like me.</i>

71
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,200
<i>Why I waste my talents
on you I don't see.</i>

72
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,880
<i>Sometimes I feel
(and it's quite spontaneous)</i>

73
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,560
<i>That I'll never find a woman
to match my genius.</i>

74
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,880
<i>So I'm on the straight and narrow,
quite unbesmirched,</i>

75
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,400
<i>There is no turtle dove
sitting on my perch.</i>

76
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,080
<i>I share my wisdom,
I give you all I've got.</i>

77
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,840
<i>I waste my martyrdom
on a kid who just cannot.</i>

78
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,400
<i>I'm surrounded by dunces,
there's no hope,</i>

79
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:43,440
<i>Only Mick and Karen Elise
can keep up.</i>

80
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,640
<i>But Dennis, you're a nothing,
a hole in the ground,</i>

81
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,720
<i>You'll never be like me.</i>

82
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,680
<i>Why I waste my talents
on you I don't see.</i>

83
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,520
<i>But Dennis, you're a nothing,
a hole in the ground,</i>

84
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,800
<i>You'll never be like me.</i>

85
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,720
<i>Why I waste my talents
on you I don't see.</i>

86
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,200
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

87
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,280
<i>With a hop and come, two, three.</i>

88
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,160
<i>Oh, well. It was wall-to-wall.</i>

89
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,800
DENNIS!!!

90
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,520
Hi.

91
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,000
Don't mind Sandstrøm.

92
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,080
He's fucking stupid.

93
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,960
- He's fucking stupid.
- What?

94
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,240
Where the heck are you going?
We've got gym.

95
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,800
Fuck.

96
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,200
Come on, Dennis P.!

97
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,160
Sure, laugh away.

98
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,400
Whenever I have a problem, I say
a prayer, and God helps me.

99
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,680
Hi, guys.

100
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,960
- Hi, Karen Elise.
- A big coke, please.

101
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,400
Well then?

102
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,920
- See you at the party, right?
- Right.

103
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,400
What time are you going?

104
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,880
- time... time...
- What time?

105
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,200
- At ... 8.30.
- Okay, see you.

106
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,240
See you, Karen Elise.

107
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,520
Hey, guys.

108
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,120
There's an old saying:

109
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,480
"A beautiful girl can be a knife
in the back of men's friendship."

110
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,560
You want to watch
those old sayings, eh?

111
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,280
- If we said...
- Said what?

112
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,240
If you had to choose a girl from
our class ... including Majbritt.

113
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,640
Who would you choose?

114
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,000
I'd definitely choose Karen Elise.

115
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,200
Karen Elise?

116
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,840
- Even if you could choose Majbritt?
- Yes.

117
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,480
- Giorgos, we're outta here!
- Enjoy your party, guys

118
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,240
Don't droop on each other.
Lovely, Minna. Smile. Chests.

119
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,600
Keep your heads up.

120
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,000
Keep in line,
don't drag your feet!

121
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,400
Give me a smile.
It won't cost you anything.

122
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,680
To the side.

123
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,800
What are you doing,
Dennis Petersen?

124
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,040
Hi, Mum.

125
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,800
I just thought
that was the record.

126
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,840
I remember it was the record
you and dad always played.

127
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,280
So you think you remember, Dennis?

128
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,640
Then let us remember
together, Dennis.

129
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,600
Let us remember
the evening your father got drunk -

130
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,480
- and decided to dance like
a monkey in this very room, Dennis.

131
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,800
Turn up the volume,
open the windows!

132
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,400
Louder! Wilder!
Do the rock'n'roll!

133
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,720
Hey, there isn't enough room
to do the rock'n'roll.

134
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,120
I'll go outside
and dance on the roof.

135
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,640
Wild is how I like it.
Wilder, wilder.

136
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,520
Right to the very edge, Dennis.

137
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,400
Right to the edge.

138
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,240
He danced himself to death?

139
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,440
You might say so.

140
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,360
That's why we never play
this record, right, Dennis?

141
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,920
Fuck!

142
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,440
Fuck.

143
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,200
Hey, Mum ... tonight, right?

144
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:05,600
It's Saturday night,
so tomorrow I can have a lie-in.

145
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,920
And Polle's having a ...
So I was going to ask ...

146
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,160
What were you going to ask?

147
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,760
Can I sleep over at Mick's?

148
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,280
Because Sandstrøm's
given us a load of homework,

149
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,160
we want to get it out of the way.

150
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,280
But I don't want
to walk home that late.

151
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,160
If you absolutely ...

152
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,880
Right, you sleep over at Michael's.

153
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,560
I'm going to do the shopping.

154
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,440
I'll come and carry.

155
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,160
That's really sweet of you, Dennis.

156
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Shit.

157
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,400
- Hey, there's Michael's mother!
- Hi.

158
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,480
Hi there. I hear the boys
are getting together tonight.

159
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,120
Yes, though I've told Michael
to be home by midnight.

160
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,360
- Midnight?
- Yes, from Poul's party.

161
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,520
And they're not to drink
more than two beers.

162
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,080
<i>I say: "OK, you're telling me lies."</i>

163
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,000
<i>I don't believe my ears or eyes.</i>

164
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,600
<i>I've allowed you
loads of latitude.</i>

165
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,200
<i>And this is how
you show your gratitude.</i>

166
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,800
<i>You said "homework",
I thought you'd be at Mick's.</i>

167
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,720
<i>But it's at Poul's party
you intend to get your kicks.</i>

168
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,920
<i>I say disaster.</i>

169
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,600
<i>Disease and death.</i>

170
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,360
<i>I say look out.</i>

171
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,680
<i>Or you'll take your last breath.</i>

172
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,360
<i>If you love you lose,
it should be banned.</i>

173
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,280
<i>A girl kisses my boy,
and that's that.</i>

174
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,520
<i>It ain't easy,
but I do what I can.</i>

175
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,120
<i>I'm so alone,
and I need a man.</i>

176
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,800
<i>A guy who's big and strong
and rather</i>

177
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,280
<i>Like the picture you've
got of your father.</i>

178
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,240
<i>Look at him smiling,
as if to say:</i>

179
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,840
<i>"Life is a moment
that'll never go away.</i>

180
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,280
<i>I say disaster.</i>

181
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,880
<i>Disease and death.</i>

182
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,520
<i>I say look out.</i>

183
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,480
<i>Or you'll take your last breath.</i>

184
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,520
<i>If you love you lose,
it should be banned.</i>

185
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,640
<i>Dance too wildly on a roof,
and that's that.</i>

186
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,120
<i>She says fall down.</i>

187
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,800
<i>Disease and death.</i>

188
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,680
<i>She says look out.</i>

189
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,520
Are you listening, Dennis Petersen?

190
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,480
I say alcohol poisoning.
I say young men with knives.

191
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,800
I say drink driving.

192
00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:00,080
But possibly, Dennis Petersen,
if you had made a couple of promises -

193
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,720
- I might possibly have
let you go to the party.

194
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,520
I haven't forgotten ...

195
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,040
I remember how important it is
to be with one's pals at your age.

196
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,440
But now you've decided to lie
to me, Dennis,

197
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,840
case closed.
Your Saturday evening is closed.

198
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,480
Finished!

199
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,680
And I'm going to bed with
a migraine, so don't make noises.

200
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,600
Hi, Dennis.
You're up early.

201
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,320
Dennis. There is a very
old saying about problems.

202
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,640
Want to hear it?

203
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:15,040
"You never have so many problems
that you can't pray for help".

204
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,160
Hi, God. Dennis P. here

205
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,280
God, I know I don't
normally kneel like this, -

206
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,640
- but I've just got
to talk to somebody.

207
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,520
My mum's flipped her lid.

208
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:54,320
My dad's all she thinks of,
and she gets so upset.

209
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,960
I miss him, too, of course.

210
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Then there's Karen Elise.
I like her so much.

211
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,160
But so does Mick.

212
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,320
And there's one more thing, too.

213
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,800
I am still the only boy
in my class who hasn't ...

214
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,800
... who hasn't ...

215
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,480
Who hasn't got pubes.

216
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,280
I know it doesn't sound
like a particular problem -

217
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,400
- compared to what else
is going on around the world.

218
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,760
But to me it means one hell of a lot.

219
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,200
That's all I wanted to say.

220
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,120
Bye.

221
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,760
<i>Now everything's gone wrong,
and your hopes have come to nought,</i>

222
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:44,560
<i>You find yourself tempted
to send God a thought.</i>

223
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,640
<i>God heard your prayer</i>

224
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,320
<i>Winging through the air</i>

225
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,320
<i>And now God's messenger's here</i>

226
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,600
<i>Come on, Baby, make up your mind!
Don't make me wait all day.</i>

227
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,800
<i>Listen, Baby, it's up to you!
If you wanna live life, just say!</i>

228
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,400
<i>I bet you're thinking,
your brain has crashed,</i>

229
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,720
<i>But, oh yes, I'm real,
even if you do feel trashed.</i>

230
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:33,200
<i>Stay here, chill out,
'cause for what it's worth</i>

231
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,480
<i>There's far, far more
between heaven and earth.</i>

232
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:47,120
<i>Come on, Baby, make up your mind,
don't make me wait all day.</i>

233
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:53,520
<i>Listen, Baby, it's up to you!
If you wanna live life, just say!</i>

234
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:06,160
<i>Come on, Baby, whaddaya say?
Let's not wait all day.</i>

235
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:12,400
<i>Come on, Baby, it's up to you!
If you wanna live life, just say!</i>

236
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,960
- Hi, Dennis.
- God?

237
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,760
No, I'm just one of
the heavenly messengers.

238
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
You know, a kind of courier service.
Take a pew.

239
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,760
Your prayer has been heard.

240
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,080
So straighten up
and pull on your pumps.

241
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,720
You look like ... but ... you ...

242
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,520
That's enough about me.

243
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,040
This is about you and your problems.

244
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,200
- First of all, there's my mum.
- Stop!

245
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,080
We don't fix such poxy little
things that way; we issue licenses.

246
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,160
Licenses?

247
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,760
Angel licenses. So you can solve
your problems however it suits you.

248
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,760
Okay.

249
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,720
Does an angel license mean
I can fly and walk on water?

250
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:47,280
Nope. You'll get the ordinary
license for medium miracles.

251
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,120
Oh, okay.

252
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,360
However there's some
strings attached, Dennis.

253
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,960
No swearing.

254
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,200
No swearing? That's bl ...

255
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,840
Or you'll lose your license. And you'll
be through, done for, out of the game.

256
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:13,520
Okay. If I swear I'm done for.
I read you.

257
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,400
Okay. Dennis ...

258
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,080
The dance floor is yours.

259
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,920
But how do I ...

260
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,040
Wow!

261
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,680
- Dennis. Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

262
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,480
But do I look different?

263
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,920
Is there anything on my back?

264
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,320
Your back looks like your back.

265
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,960
Sure? There's nothing there?

266
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,520
You are all right, aren't you?

267
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,920
I am ...

268
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,000
- I am on a b ... on a ball.
- On a ball?

269
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,360
Want some chips?

270
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,080
No, I just came by
to thank you for your saying.

271
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,600
Okay ... I would like a ...

272
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,160
... an awesome stereo.

273
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,600
Ah ...

274
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,760
Well, I'll be b ..."blowed?"

275
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,920
"Hasta la vista ...

276
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,960
... baby."

277
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,280
Are you talking to me?

278
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,480
Sandstrøm, are you talking to me?

279
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,760
You must be.
There isn't anybody else here.

280
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:03,440
Get that, Copenhagen!
I've got pubes! Yes!

281
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:12,240
Dennis, don't bug me.
I've got migraine. Second degree.

282
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,520
Dennis P. is in the house!

283
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,400
Hello?

284
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,160
Hi.

285
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,360
What are you up to?

286
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:51,600
Are you better? You missed the
party and Mick said you were ill.

287
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,960
- The fair.
- What?

288
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,920
The fair. I want to take
you to the fair.

289
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,240
Okay. What about Mick?

290
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,920
Mick was coming, but ...

291
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,240
But he had to go out with his mum.

292
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,320
- All right then.
- I'll wait down here.

293
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,960
Hi, Dennis P.

294
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,280
- What are you doing here?
- I was on my way to your place.

295
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,080
What are you doing here?

296
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,240
- Hi, Mick, are you coming after all?
- Yes. Where to?

297
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,800
I'm trashed.

298
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,880
- We really went for it last night.
- Some of us did, some of us didn't.

299
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,240
- What shall we do next?
- I've got to take a piss.

300
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,480
You know what, Mick? So do I.

301
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,640
Aah.

302
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,640
That's better, man.
I really drank myself into a ...

303
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:32,320
- Bloody hell!
- It suddenly started sprouting all over.

304
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,600
What are you doing?

305
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,480
Ssch!

306
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:04,400
- What's wrong with McDonalds?
- No, this is much nicer.

307
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,560
Waiter.

308
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,280
A table for three.

309
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,240
Perhaps you should find
somewhere more suitable ...

310
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,720
Come with me.

311
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:34,160
Do you do burgers? You know, a bun
with a beef pattie and ketchup in?

312
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,040
I'll tell the chef.

313
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,880
I'll have the "Potage Parmantier".

314
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:46,000
- I'll have a burger, too.
- Certainly, Ma'am. Sirs.

315
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:51,480
This Ma'am is going
to wash her hands, Sirs.

316
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,400
Your mum
won the lottery or something?

317
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,720
No, it's some kind of campaign
the restaurant is running.

318
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:07,120
On Children's Day in France kids get
to eat for free if they're under 14.

319
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,480
No way.

320
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,840
Today it's as if
we point at anything, we get it.

321
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,080
- Yes. Life is a miracle.
- It's fucking amazing.

322
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,720
- Mick, would you try not to swear?
- Why? Saying "fuck" is cool.

323
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,760
- No, swearing is out.
- Not for me it's bloody not.

324
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,400
Do as I say, Mick.

325
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,080
- This is one fu ... fine place.
- Wow.

326
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,720
And ...

327
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,360
"Potage Parmantier".

328
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,600
- What's that?
- Potato soup.

329
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,400
Yes, and I love it.

330
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,480
Cheers!

331
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,840
See you.

332
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,640
See you, Karen Elise.

333
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,880
You know what I nearly did?

334
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,720
No, I'm not bl ...
jolly well going to mention it.

335
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,720
Go on.

336
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,320
Last night
I was pissed out of my skull.

337
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,840
I came so close to
saying to Karen Elise:

338
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,520
"Karen Elise, you are so sweet."

339
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,320
This close.

340
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,720
But in a way it was f...
fine that I didn't.

341
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:23,240
You have to be sober when you say
things like that. Know why?

342
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:29,120
Because Karen Elise is right, and
right girls don't grow on trees.

343
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,960
- Coming?
- Mick?

344
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,840
I have this feeling
that when you wake up tomorrow -

345
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,720
- you'll have a really
naff dress sense.

346
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,240
Sometimes you're weird, Dennis P.

347
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,720
- Is that you?
- Yes, Mum

348
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,480
Where have you been?
I've been beside myself, Dennis.

349
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,240
I say stabbings.
I say accidents.

350
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,720
I say sexually deviant pedophiles.

351
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,600
- Mum, that'll do.
- Dennis?

352
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:14,240
I'm telling you, and that's
the way it is. That'll do.

353
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,600
Dennis, have you joined a gang?

354
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,480
That'll do.
Go to bed. When you wake up

355
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,040
you'll be totally full of go.
Do you read me?

356
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,120
I can't go to bed.
I've only just got up.

357
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,480
Sorry, Mama.

358
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,360
- Goodnight, Dennis.
- Goodnight, Mummy.

359
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,080
Mum?

360
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,240
Mum?

361
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,720
Mum, Mum, Mum. What's up, Sugar?
Couldn't you find your way home?

362
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,960
It's taken me a hundred years to
find what's left of some lipstick -

363
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,960
- and a dried-out mascara.

364
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,480
Today Mona is going
to shop until she drops.

365
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,120
- What about my breakfast?
- What about it, Honeybunch?

366
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,080
You always ...

367
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:48,160
Sugar, you're twelve
and I'm not a waitress.

368
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:52,880
I've got 600 things to do today.
I say for example:

369
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:56,720
New make-up, a new wardrobe,
new lingerie.

370
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,720
So if you'd feed yourself today, okay?

371
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,320
- What about my packed lunch?
- What do you need that for?

372
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,320
- I need it for school.
- School?

373
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,840
You're a big boy and big boys skive
off and watch porno movies, okay?

374
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:19,680
But today I've got to go to school.
To sort something out.

375
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:24,560
Here ... Next thing I know you'll be
joining the Young Christians.

376
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,840
You want me to buy lunch with this?

377
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,480
No, Baby, roll it up tightly
and stick it up your bum.

378
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:36,720
You'll feel so full.
Lord preserve us!

379
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,880
- Hi, Mick.
- Hi.

380
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,360
- Nice rags.
- Right.

381
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:14,160
It's weird. This morning my
cupboard was full of ugly clothes.

382
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:19,360
But luckily I found these.
And these amazing rollerskates.

383
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,240
It's going to be a great day, Mick.

384
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,880
Are you dressing like that?

385
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,200
He really looks trendy today.

386
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:45,280
- He looks sort of loveable.
- Loveable?

387
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,040
Yes. It kind of makes you
want to look after him.

388
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,200
Okay, it's the last lesson.

389
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,160
- What have we got?
- Sandstrøm.

390
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,280
You're really trying
to look loveable, eh?

391
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,320
Good afternoon,
O pygmies of the intelligentsia.

392
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:11,520
Here I am,
the school's humble servant.

393
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,040
We are going to explain
the Weimar Republic.

394
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:23,600
By no means simple, but all
the more interesting for that.

395
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:28,000
Whom shall we torment today?

396
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,840
I'd love to make
a couple of minor points.

397
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Dennis Petersen.

398
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,840
The Weimar Republic is all yours.

399
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,840
Not the Whining Republic,
Sandstrøm.

400
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:52,080
- I'd rather talk about you.
- Pardon?

401
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,960
You are ridiculous.
Pitiful.

402
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,240
A grown man who picks on kids
to make him feel big.

403
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,640
- You are not well, are you?
- You are a loser.

404
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,520
I'm sick of your yacking.
That will fucking do.

405
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,840
Dennis, come with me.

406
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:14,160
Pop down and get us all
an ice cream. NOW!

407
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,520
- Easy does it, Dennis.
- Out!

408
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,920
I swore.

409
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,440
- I swore!
- That's all right. Never mind.

410
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,360
- I said "fucking"!
- Fucking is quite okay.

411
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:47,200
"Fucking" is all right.
Dennis, you're a big boy.

412
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,960
Fuck! Fuck!

413
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,640
Piss!

414
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,000
God, it's Dennis P. again.
I know I swore. I know.

415
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,480
Dennis Petersen.

416
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,040
Got knocked off your perch, eh?

417
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,640
Dennis, are you invoking Our Lord
in the school lavatories?

418
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,360
Can't you help me?

419
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,360
We had a deal.

420
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:41,200
Swear and that was that.

421
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,800
Listen, what if I do the whole works.

422
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,480
Go to church every Sunday,
get confirmed, -

423
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:54,560
- join the Red Cross and the
Young Christians, give me a chance.

424
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,880
One more chance, then. We'll
say it was a beginner's slip-up.

425
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,200
Thanks, thanks.

426
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,120
<i>- Dennis!</i>
- Watch out.

427
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,680
I think Sandstrøm
is coming to ask you to the ball.

428
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,480
Dennis?

429
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,720
Yes!

430
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,320
Dennis!

431
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,560
Dennis, we'll go to see the school
psychologist and lay you out.

432
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,680
You're done for, Sandstrøm.
I've got God behind me.

433
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,080
That's nice Dennis.
That sounds like I'm finished.

434
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,920
- I could turn you into a bread oven.
- That sounds interested, Dennis.

435
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:49,360
Or I could make you dance in a tutu.

436
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,120
That will do, Dennis!

437
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,760
I could make you into my
humble servant.

438
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,160
Mr. Petersen?

439
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,600
Mr. Petersen, are you alright?

440
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:12,080
- Mr. Petersen?
- Let me help you, Mr. Petersen.

441
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,640
- Just call me Dennis P.
- Very good, Mr. Dennis P.

442
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,400
Stand still.

443
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,040
Yes, Mr. Dennis P.

444
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,000
- See you, Sandypansy.
- Thank you, Mr. Dennis P.

445
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,680
Mr. Dennis P.? I'm sorry?

446
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,800
Dennis, I've been
shopping and thinking all day.

447
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,880
The world is huge!
Where do you want to go?

448
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,360
How about ... America!

449
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,840
- What do you think?
- You'll figure it out.

450
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,120
Dennis, the cutest
little man has come to see you.

451
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,280
Me?

452
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,440
Do excuse me, Dennis P., but I was
wondering if you needed any help.

453
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,680
You seemed so worried.

454
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,160
My God, he is loveable!

455
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,880
May I help you with your cardy?

456
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,600
I just couldn't resist
the double buttons.

457
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:09,200
I'll pop down to the offie
for a merry old bottle ...

458
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,040
... of piña colada.

459
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,560
<i>Adios.</i>

460
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:23,040
- An enchanting woman, your mother.
- Sandstrøm.

461
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,840
This is a bit ODD.

462
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,440
You're quite right, Mr. Dennis P.

463
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,160
Ssch!

464
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,440
Mickey boy, come to see me?

465
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,800
No, I just wanted to
see if Dennis P. was in.

466
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,520
He is.
And so am I ...

467
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,280
Mr. Dennis P.
I hope there's nothing wrong.

468
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,800
One thing at a time.
I'll deal with you later.

469
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,640
Don't come out till I say so.

470
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,480
<i>Mr. Dennis P.?</i>

471
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:02,800
Not until you say so.
I'll stay in here.

472
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,600
<i>Be good.</i>

473
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,800
Wow, your mum, man!
Blow me!

474
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:12,880
I know. I'll readjust her
when she gets back.

475
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,520
- How?
- What do you want?

476
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,680
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. Goodbye, Mick.

477
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:25,200
When you left, when Sandstrøm ran
after you. He didn't come back.

478
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,000
- Isn't it weird?
- Yes, a bit. Goodbye, Mick.

479
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,040
- Aren't we going out for our chips?
- Not today. And you're going home.

480
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,800
- I've only just got here.
- And now you're just going.

481
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:40,480
- Hey, you're being really weird.
- I've got things to adjust.

482
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,600
By the way, Mick, you and me
have something to sort out.

483
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:53,440
Karen Elise isn't big enough
for the both of us.

484
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,280
From now on you have
no claim to Karen Elise.

485
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,280
Why not?

486
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:07,040
You're so weird, Dennis P.

487
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,560
Mick.

488
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,160
How would you feel if I said
"Karen Elise"?

489
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,960
Why do we always have to talk
about her? She is so icky.

490
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:22,480
The mere thought of touching her ...

491
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:27,840
So you've no objections
... if I go out with her?

492
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,480
You're welcome to her.

493
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,520
See you, Mick.

494
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,080
Her breath stinks, too.

495
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,320
- Her breath stinks.
<i>- Uh-uh? Mr. Dennis P.?</i>

496
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,480
- Sandstrøm?
- Mr. Dennis P.?

497
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,080
From now on you're not going
to be quite so ...

498
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,920
Stay in there.

499
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,840
Mr. Dennis P.? I'll stay in here.

500
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,600
Hi.

501
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:15,040
- How are you doing?
- Great.

502
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,640
I thought you might like a chat.

503
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,240
Dennis?

504
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,440
A chat ... sure thing.

505
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,640
It was as if you were going
... crackers.

506
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,080
- When?
- With Sandstrøm today.

507
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:44,080
Karen Elise ...

508
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,360
What are you doing?

509
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,360
- I've something to tell you.
- Yes, you need someone to talk to.

510
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,800
Not just anyone.
Just you.

511
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,280
Okay.

512
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:10,720
- And I'm really pleased I'm sober.
- Have you started drinking?

513
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:17,280
Karen Elise,
what if I told you:

514
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:22,880
- I think you are really sweet.
- I think you're really sweet, too.

515
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:27,040
Not that kind of sweet. Really sweet.

516
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,640
I am in love with you.

517
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:57,040
I really, really like you, too.

518
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,800
But I suppose
I like Mick just a bit more.

519
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:11,280
No, listen. I really like you, too.
But more as a friend.

520
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:16,000
- With Mick it's more ...
- Mick? He doesn't even like you.

521
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,800
He thinks you're yucky and
he thinks your breath stinks.

522
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,840
That's what he said.

523
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,600
Mick said that?

524
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,320
- Why not stay here?
- But I'm not in love with you.

525
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,800
You're mistaken.
You're madly in love with me.

526
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,120
Dennis P.?

527
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,320
Love, love, love ...
Now I know thy name.

528
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:59,680
I am yours, and yours alone.
Come, Dennis, come! I am yours!

529
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,360
Hey, take it easy.

530
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:05,680
No, Dennis.
Burning desire ...

531
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:08,960
No, this is far too quick.

532
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,360
You don't love me.

533
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,800
I call out your name
but you don't reply.

534
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,600
I do. I'm calling, too.

535
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,160
You are so sweet.

536
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:35,120
But we are only twelve. And twelve
year olds don't do that desire bit.

537
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,520
Then show me how, my love.

538
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:06,000
<i>The whole world rhymes with Elise, -</i>

539
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:11,520
<i> - slowly it's turning into candyfloss.</i>

540
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:17,360
<i>We rule the world.
And now it's a given, -</i>

541
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:23,040
<i>- that above us
everything's heaven.</i>

542
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:28,320
<i>- Love
- Give it all you've got.</i>

543
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:34,000
<i>- I'm ready and willing; who's not?
- Love.</i>

544
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:40,320
<i>Hark! A thousand angels
are singing their song.</i>

545
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:46,240
<i>It was best to be a couple all along.</i>

546
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:51,680
<i>- I want a cuddle.
- Don't start a riot.</i>

547
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:57,680
<i>- I'm wild and you are tame.
- Do be quiet.</i>

548
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:14,880
<i>- I'm aflame, I want love's feast
- No, stop it, stop!</i>

549
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:20,320
<i>- Come and take me like a beast.
- No, no, stop that at once.</i>

550
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:26,000
<i>Oh, my little darling,
now I can live life and be glad, -</i>

551
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:32,560
<i>- because you are Karen,
the girl I want so bad.</i>

552
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,960
Piña colada!

553
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,960
- Get out!
- Where's that cute guy?

554
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,960
Get out!

555
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,840
Sure.

556
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:53,200
- Dennis.
- Karen Elise.

557
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,560
Sorry.

558
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,200
- It's that Mick again.
- Don't let him in.

559
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:06,000
I think he fancies me.

560
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:10,000
- Don't let him in.
- He is practically in.

561
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,320
- Goodbye, Mick.
- Hear me out.

562
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:16,640
I said, I didn't care,
but you're my best friend.

563
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,960
- About what?
- Mum, shut up!

564
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:22,080
She's yucky. She'll ruin you.

565
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:25,360
- Who?
- Mum, Sandstrøm is in the closet.

566
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:29,120
- "Mona is in the closet."
- Sandstrøm's in your closet?

567
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:33,440
Yes. Things need adjusting
but I need time to work out how.

568
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,200
She's too ugly and stupid.

569
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,880
Karen Elise won't cross
my threshold.

570
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:42,000
- Beloved!
- She's here!

571
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,880
- You! You ... tart!
- Mick, that'll do.

572
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:55,680
You are so disgusting. Stinking
away on my best friend's bed!

573
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,280
Look who's talking, Shortie?

574
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,240
You're wasting his air and his time.

575
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,200
I'll get rid of you.

576
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,400
Karen Elise!

577
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,840
- Mick, stop it!
- Tart!

578
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:39,760
For fuck's sake!
Bloody well stop it!

579
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:33,360
I didn't mean to.
It can't stop now.

580
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,680
Game over, Dennis.

581
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:40,080
Everything's gone amok.

582
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:44,000
Things need adjusting.
I haven't had time to think clearly.

583
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,480
I know.

584
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:52,560
Mum is knocking back
piña coladas in the wardrobe -

585
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:56,960
with a teacher,
who thinks he's my servant.

586
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,640
I know, Dennis.

587
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:05,520
And Mick and Karen Elise are
killing each other because of me.

588
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:09,120
I know.

589
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,960
It's no good.

590
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,360
I'm sorry, lad.

591
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,800
You've got to help me.

592
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:26,080
If you'd been my dad ...

593
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:34,640
... or if I look like a kid
who might have been your son ...

594
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,400
... help me.

595
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:46,400
I don't make the rules, Dennis.
It's not up to me.

596
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:51,520
Then drop the rules and
help a boy who's only twelve -

597
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:55,280
- and can't take a shower at school
because he's got no pubes.

598
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,680
And whose mum is
trying to suffocate him.

599
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:08,640
Not only once in a while.
Every single day.

600
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:14,800
I'm not praying to God,
don't think that.

601
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,480
I'm asking you for help.

602
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,400
You.

603
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:32,640
Okay, Dennis. I'll give you one wish.

604
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:36,400
But hurry up, or
my God will I be in trouble!

605
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:40,480
One wish? In that case, both ...

606
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:43,120
One wish, Dennis!

607
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:48,000
Okay ...
Sandstr ...

608
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:52,000
... and Kar ... or mum ...

609
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,840
I want all my wishes undone.

610
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,920
What are you doing?

611
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:51,680
I know what we're doing, but not
why we are doing it in your room.

612
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,560
Hi.

613
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,040
I'm in a fucking daze, though.

614
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:59,680
Didn't I come to tell you something?

615
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:04,960
I've got a shitty headache.
I'd like to be alone. Okay?

616
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:08,800
Hey, what am I wearing?

617
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:11,680
- It's loveable.
- "Loveable" yourself ...

618
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:13,920
Show yourselves out, all right?

619
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,160
See you, Dennis P.

620
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,880
I was right.

621
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:30,560
All I had to do was tell her:
"Karen Elise, you're really sweet".

622
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:34,320
And suddenly there we lay.

623
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:39,840
- It was like a fucking dream.
- Right. See you, Mick.

624
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:48,720
If you grab Majbritt, right?
We'll have a ball. All four of us.

625
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,120
Yes.
Right.

626
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,760
- Dennis.
- What have you been doing?

627
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,120
- Yes, what indeed?

628
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:17,840
What have we been doing?

629
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:22,720
We've been round the houses,
I can tell you.

630
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,360
Gosh! That piña colada!

631
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:28,480
Perhaps I should be ...

632
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,960
I say coffee.

633
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,960
I say biscuits.

634
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,560
I say we have it on the sofa.

635
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:42,960
And I say "Yes, please".
A cup of coffee does you good.

636
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,320
I'll put the kettle on.

637
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,880
Erling.

638
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,840
Erling?

639
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,400
Dennis ... listen.

640
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:09,840
Did we have a bit of a run-in,
you and I?

641
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,480
I seem to recall ...

642
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,920
Listen to me.

643
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:19,760
How about we men
forget all about it and ...

644
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:23,280
... make a fresh start?

645
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:27,200
Who'd have guessed you had
such an enchanting mother, eh?

646
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:31,200
Love, love.
Now I know thy name.

647
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,800
What a nice home.

648
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:40,480
Mona, what a lot of lovely trophies!

649
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:45,520
<i>My late husband and I were professional
dancers. But that was years ago.</i>

650
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:47,440
Gosh, Mona!

651
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,600
How funny.

652
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:52,880
I can tell you I had a few
dances to this record in my day.

653
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:55,200
Well, put it on, then.

654
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:58,320
Yes, I'd like to hear it again.

655
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,760
It's got real go, eh?

656
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,360
I'll be off.

657
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,080
And a small chips, Dennis.

658
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,640
<i>Bon appetit.</i>

659
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:41,520
- We haven't seen much of Mick lately.
- No. He's got Karen Elise.

660
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,360
A bit of a bummer, eh?

661
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:52,000
And my mum is going
out with my homeroom teacher.

662
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,080
Oh? A bit irritating, eh?

663
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:03,360
And there's another thing.
But never mind that.

664
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:07,360
Not too good, eh, Dennis?
But there is an old saying.

665
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:11,120
"If a young man ..."

666
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:14,360
No.
"When a young ..."

667
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:22,880
- Oh, yes. "You must never ..."
- What?

668
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,480
I've forgotten.

669
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:30,480
Never mind.
I'm getting tired of old sayings.

670
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:11,600
Copenhagen!!

671
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:15,200
Me, Dennis P, I have hair -

672
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:18,080
- and I grew it myself! Yes!

673
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:20,240
One pube!

674
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,920
Whoops.

675
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:35,040
Hi, my name's Julie.
We've just moved in.

676
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:38,480
Julie.

677
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:42,160
Mum said there were
some box rooms up here.

678
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:44,160
- Box rooms?
- Yes.

679
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:48,480
For storage and stuff.
