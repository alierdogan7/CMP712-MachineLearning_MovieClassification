1
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:31,757
There once was a wise little hen

2
00:00:33,046 --> 00:00:34,399
Who worried now and then

3
00:00:34,526 --> 00:00:39,042
For fear that she'd be found in need
When winter came again

4
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:43,364
With a basket full of corn
She started out one morn

5
00:00:43,486 --> 00:00:48,276
She hoped to get the friends she met
To help her plant her corn

6
00:00:57,126 --> 00:00:58,844
Who'll help her plant her corn?

7
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,400
Who'll help her plant her corn?

8
00:01:01,526 --> 00:01:06,077
Gay Peter Pig, who's strong and big
Might help her plant her corn

9
00:01:21,566 --> 00:01:25,844
Will you help me plant my corn?
Will you help me plant my corn?

10
00:01:27,406 --> 00:01:33,038
Who, me? Oh, no. I've got a bellyache.

11
00:01:58,366 --> 00:02:02,154
Who'll help her plant her corn?
Who'll help her plant her corn?

12
00:02:03,446 --> 00:02:07,519
If Donald Duck has any pluck
He'll help her plant her corn

13
00:02:20,726 --> 00:02:25,038
Will you help me plant my corn?
Will you help me plant my corn?

14
00:02:26,566 --> 00:02:32,118
Who, me? Oh, no. I got a bellyache.

15
00:02:49,846 --> 00:02:54,283
Who'll help her plant her corn?
Who'll help her plant her corn?

16
00:02:54,406 --> 00:02:58,843
She might have known that she alone
Would have to plant her corn

17
00:03:56,966 --> 00:04:00,720
Who'll help her harvest corn?
Who'll help her harvest corn?

18
00:04:02,006 --> 00:04:06,204
Perhaps her friends will condescend
To help her harvest corn

19
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:23,723
Will you help me harvest corn?
Will you help me harvest corn?

20
00:04:25,286 --> 00:04:28,198
Who, me? Oh, no.

21
00:04:28,566 --> 00:04:31,000
We've got a bellyache.

22
00:04:52,486 --> 00:04:56,923
Who'll help her harvest corn?
Who'll help her harvest corn?

23
00:04:57,046 --> 00:05:01,597
She might have known that she alone
Would have to harvest corn

24
00:05:03,686 --> 00:05:05,881
Oh, me, oh, me, oh, my

25
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:10,045
- Just look at what that little hen's got.
- Does that look good.

26
00:05:10,326 --> 00:05:12,715
There'll soon be muffins
and cakes galore.

27
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:17,362
- Cornpones and fritters by the score.
- More cornbread than I've seen before.

28
00:05:17,486 --> 00:05:20,319
Do I feel hungry!

29
00:05:21,526 --> 00:05:24,040
Oh, me, oh, me, oh, my

30
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:28,364
Corn on the cob with gobs and gobs
of melted butter oozing round.

31
00:05:28,486 --> 00:05:31,319
Corn soup enough
to feed and stuff an army.

32
00:05:31,446 --> 00:05:32,515
Boy, oh, boy.

33
00:05:32,646 --> 00:05:37,242
Who'll help her eat her corn?
Who'll help her eat her corn?

34
00:05:37,366 --> 00:05:42,394
Perhaps her friends will condescend
To help her eat her corn

35
00:06:10,966 --> 00:06:15,164
Will you help me eat my corn?
Will you help me eat my corn?

36
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:18,801
Who, me?

37
00:06:19,326 --> 00:06:23,285
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. And how!

38
00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:57,484
She'll eat the corn herself
She'll eat the corn herself

39
00:07:02,326 --> 00:07:06,524
She'll eat the corn herself
She'll eat the corn herself

40
00:07:06,646 --> 00:07:10,878
Although her friends now see the light
They've nothing but an appetite

41
00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:15,477
While they repent with all their might
She'll eat the corn herself

42
00:07:15,606 --> 00:07:19,724
She'll eat the corn herself

43
00:07:19,846 --> 00:07:24,086
She'll eat the corn herself

44
00:07:24,086 --> 00:07:25,286
She'll eat the corn herself
