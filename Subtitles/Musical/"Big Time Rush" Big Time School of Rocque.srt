1
00:00:04,367 --> 00:00:06,387
Is it time?
- It's time.

2
00:00:08,229 --> 00:00:10,049
Carlos, do the honors.

3
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:12,289
Whow!
Free hair gel!

4
00:00:15,521 --> 00:00:16,921
[Laughs]

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,490
Yea, funny, very funny.
Now, where’s the free hair gel?

6
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:24,502
How's the sweatiest is this.
It's like a vacation with singing.

7
00:00:25,656 --> 00:00:27,756
It's a <i>sing-cation</i>.

8
00:00:28,254 --> 00:00:30,654
Ok guys, dry off and get dressed.
It's time to hit the studio.

9
00:00:30,853 --> 00:00:31,973
Kelly!

10
00:00:31,994 --> 00:00:35,394
What does the great Gustavo Rocque
have in store for us today?

11
00:00:35,466 --> 00:00:38,166
Harmonies?
- Breaking down some new dance moves.

12
00:00:38,188 --> 00:00:40,008
A big Hollywod party to get us some
"red carpet exposure"?

13
00:00:40,537 --> 00:00:42,637
Close.
You're going to school.

14
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:43,999
[bell ringing]

15
00:00:44,062 --> 00:00:45,882

00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:37,192
Carlos, for the 11th time...
I'm not kidding.

36
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,460
You all thought
you were gonna get

37
00:01:38,528 --> 00:01:39,695
Three months off from school?

38
00:01:39,762 --> 00:01:41,029
It was more "hope"
than "thought."

39
00:01:41,097 --> 00:01:42,531
According to

40
00:01:42,598 --> 00:01:44,599
The actors, singers,
and performers association,

41
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:46,401
Kids under 18
in the entertainment industry

42
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:48,904
Must attend four hours of school
a day.

43
00:01:48,972 --> 00:01:50,672
Did you even look at
the pamphlets I gave you?

44
00:01:55,511 --> 00:01:58,080
[buzzing]
- oh!

45
00:01:58,147 --> 00:01:59,081
Yeah!

46
00:02:03,486 --> 00:02:04,619
[giggles]

47
00:02:04,687 --> 00:02:05,754
[fly buzzing ends abruptly]

48
00:02:14,297 --> 00:02:16,264
Yeah, we looked at them.
- A little bit.

49
00:02:16,332 --> 00:02:20,635
[bell ringing]

50
00:02:20,703 --> 00:02:22,537
Tyler,
where's everybody going?

51
00:02:22,605 --> 00:02:24,573
To school at the Palm Woods.

52
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:36,418
All: Good morning, miss Collins.

53
00:02:36,486 --> 00:02:39,654
Today, class, we're gonna
learn about fractions.

54
00:02:39,722 --> 00:02:41,523
And I thought
a fun way to do this

55
00:02:41,591 --> 00:02:43,792
Would be
if we divided up some...

56
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,926
Pies.

57
00:02:44,994 --> 00:02:46,128
All: Ooh.

58
00:02:46,195 --> 00:02:47,095
I love fractions.

59
00:02:47,163 --> 00:02:48,196
I love pie.

60
00:02:48,264 --> 00:02:49,197
And after we cut them,

61
00:02:49,265 --> 00:02:50,565
I guess we'll have to eat them.

62
00:02:50,633 --> 00:02:52,167
[all cheering]

63
00:02:52,235 --> 00:02:55,103
I think
we're gonna like it here.

64
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:56,371
Oh, no.

65
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,873
You guys
aren't going to school here.

66
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,175
Well, what school
are we going to?

67
00:03:00,243 --> 00:03:01,343
[bell rings]

68
00:03:01,411 --> 00:03:04,312
Welcome
to the School of Rocque.

69
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,914
I don't like this school.

70
00:03:05,982 --> 00:03:07,082
Quiet.

71
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,216
You love it!

72
00:03:08,284 --> 00:03:09,751
Because by studying here,

73
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:11,920
You won't miss out
on rehearsal time

74
00:03:11,988 --> 00:03:13,755
And recording sessions.

75
00:03:13,823 --> 00:03:15,323
Instead of lunch break,

76
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:18,260
The School of Rocque
has harmony breaks.

77
00:03:18,327 --> 00:03:21,830
And every field trip is to
the dance studio down the hall.

78
00:03:21,898 --> 00:03:23,999
And you're our teacher?

79
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:25,033
No.

80
00:03:25,101 --> 00:03:26,868
[all cheer]

81
00:03:26,936 --> 00:03:29,604
Guys, say "Hi" to Mr. Smitty.

82
00:03:29,672 --> 00:03:32,641
But you all can call me
"Mr. Smitty."

83
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:35,610
[adults laugh heartily]

84
00:03:35,678 --> 00:03:37,012
Thank you so much.

85
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,413
I can take it from here.

86
00:03:38,481 --> 00:03:40,582
Okay, then.
Oh, excuse me.

87
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,084
First up,

88
00:03:42,151 --> 00:03:44,419
We have probabilities...

89
00:03:44,487 --> 00:03:48,623
As in the probability
that this band will fail

90
00:03:48,691 --> 00:03:52,227
Before its first single
is ever released.

91
00:03:52,295 --> 00:03:54,329
I don't think
we're getting pie.

92
00:03:54,397 --> 00:03:56,231
Thud!

93
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:58,066
Mom, I don't need
homeschooling.

94
00:03:58,134 --> 00:03:59,768
I can go to
the Palm Woods school.

95
00:03:59,836 --> 00:04:01,903
Tyler says the teacher
is really cool.

96
00:04:01,971 --> 00:04:03,672
Hey, I'm cool.

97
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:05,740
And this is a chance for us
to spend time together.

98
00:04:05,808 --> 00:04:07,275
In the fresh air.

99
00:04:07,343 --> 00:04:08,610
So...

100
00:04:08,678 --> 00:04:10,645
Let's start with math.

101
00:04:10,713 --> 00:04:12,314
Hmm.

102
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:14,382
Negative integers.

103
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:19,121
"find the absolute value of 'x'
with respect to"...

104
00:04:19,188 --> 00:04:20,555
Let's start with history,

105
00:04:20,623 --> 00:04:23,758
Where today we'll talk about...

106
00:04:23,826 --> 00:04:28,463
The Peloponnesian war?

107
00:04:28,531 --> 00:04:29,865
Hi.

108
00:04:29,932 --> 00:04:31,900
I understand you have a school
at the Palm Woods.

109
00:04:31,968 --> 00:04:33,502
Good, then we're done.

110
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:35,036
Uh, no.

111
00:04:35,104 --> 00:04:37,005
What I mean is, I'd like
to enroll Katie in the school.

112
00:04:37,073 --> 00:04:39,107
Does she work in tv?

113
00:04:39,175 --> 00:04:40,509
S watches tv.

114
00:04:40,576 --> 00:04:42,677
In accordance
with our A.S.P.A. mandate,

115
00:04:42,745 --> 00:04:44,045
In order to attend our school,

116
00:04:44,113 --> 00:04:46,081
A student must be a member
of the union.

117
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:47,449
To get into the union,

118
00:04:47,517 --> 00:04:50,085
She'll have to get a job in tv,
film, or music.

119
00:04:50,153 --> 00:04:52,587
And for that, she'll need...

120
00:04:52,688 --> 00:04:56,424
A talent manager.

121
00:04:56,492 --> 00:04:57,926
Now,

122
00:04:57,994 --> 00:05:00,829
I get 15% of all her earnings.

123
00:05:00,897 --> 00:05:02,197
5% or we walk.

124
00:05:02,265 --> 00:05:03,832
Deal.

125
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,333
Here's a list
of open casting calls.

126
00:05:05,401 --> 00:05:06,768
If she lands a commercial,

127
00:05:06,836 --> 00:05:08,603
She gets into the school

128
00:05:08,671 --> 00:05:11,706
And daddy gets some
walkin'-around money.

129
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,510
Snap!

130
00:05:15,578 --> 00:05:19,881
The answer is, "x" equals 9.

131
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:23,752
You know,
I used to be in a boy band once.

132
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:25,987
Oh,
and we thought we had it made.

133
00:05:26,055 --> 00:05:27,122
Hot songs.

134
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,456
Flying business class.

135
00:05:28,524 --> 00:05:30,759
Drinking milk
straight from the carton.

136
00:05:30,826 --> 00:05:32,460
[exasperated groan]

137
00:05:32,528 --> 00:05:34,196
But let me tell you guys

138
00:05:34,263 --> 00:05:37,799
That that milk goes sour
pretty fast.

139
00:05:37,867 --> 00:05:40,268
I never thought I'd say this,
but can we get back to math?

140
00:05:40,336 --> 00:05:41,636
Yes, yes.

141
00:05:41,704 --> 00:05:46,775
Let's get back to math.

142
00:05:46,842 --> 00:05:48,109
So...

143
00:05:48,177 --> 00:05:49,511
If four boys are in a band

144
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:50,979
Making $10,000,

145
00:05:51,047 --> 00:05:53,248
Their manager gets 15%,

146
00:05:53,316 --> 00:05:56,017
Their record sales plummet 80%,

147
00:05:56,085 --> 00:05:59,120
What part of their dream
is crushed?

148
00:05:59,188 --> 00:06:00,322
Anyone?
Anyone?

149
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:01,389
Anyone?

150
00:06:01,457 --> 00:06:04,226
All of it!

151
00:06:04,293 --> 00:06:09,497
Let's turn to page 562
in our textbooks.

152
00:06:09,565 --> 00:06:10,999
What do you guys suppose
is going on

153
00:06:11,067 --> 00:06:12,734
At the palm wood school
right now?

154
00:06:17,406 --> 00:06:19,674
Okay, class,
your math homework tonight

155
00:06:19,742 --> 00:06:21,343
Is to play video games.

156
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,378
Girls: What's our
English assignment?

157
00:06:23,446 --> 00:06:25,981
To throw away your textbooks.

158
00:06:26,048 --> 00:06:27,549
And if you reach
into your desks,

159
00:06:27,617 --> 00:06:31,453
You'll find today's
science project, which is...

160
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,420
Water fight!

161
00:06:32,488 --> 00:06:35,390
[cheers and laughter]

162
00:06:38,327 --> 00:06:40,662
Pay attention

163
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,564
To the board.

164
00:06:46,502 --> 00:06:47,702
Did you guys just have

165
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,237
The same Palm Woods school
fantasy as me?

166
00:06:49,305 --> 00:06:51,039
Was the history assignment
bungee jumping?

167
00:06:51,107 --> 00:06:52,507
Close enough.

168
00:06:52,575 --> 00:06:54,576
We have got to get out of here
and into that school.

169
00:06:54,644 --> 00:06:55,810
Follow my lead.

170
00:06:55,878 --> 00:06:56,945
Hey, hey, hey.

171
00:06:57,013 --> 00:06:58,179
No talking.

172
00:06:58,247 --> 00:07:00,348
All eyes on the board.

173
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,349
The board!

174
00:07:01,417 --> 00:07:02,450
The board!

175
00:07:02,518 --> 00:07:04,419
Mr. Smitty,
do that again.

176
00:07:04,487 --> 00:07:07,289
What, this?

177
00:07:07,356 --> 00:07:09,791
Did you guys see that?
- Mm-Hmm.

178
00:07:09,859 --> 00:07:11,226
The passion, the snap,

179
00:07:11,294 --> 00:07:12,694
You can't teach that.

180
00:07:12,795 --> 00:07:13,962
Really?

181
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,630
Well, I have to admit,

182
00:07:15,698 --> 00:07:17,132
I was pretty good.

183
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,167
Which is why
you can't give up your dream.

184
00:07:19,235 --> 00:07:21,870
I mean, sure, you may be
too old for a boy band,

185
00:07:21,937 --> 00:07:26,074
But you're perfect for u uh...

186
00:07:26,142 --> 00:07:27,309
A man band!

187
00:07:27,376 --> 00:07:28,410
Uh, yes.
- Yeah.

188
00:07:28,477 --> 00:07:30,211
Which are all the rage
these days.

189
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,212
Right?

190
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,949
In Germany.

191
00:07:35,017 --> 00:07:36,551
You got a demo?

192
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:37,886
I bet it's hot.
Yeah?

193
00:07:37,953 --> 00:07:38,987
No, no, no.

194
00:07:39,055 --> 00:07:40,789
I flung those all
into the ocean.

195
00:07:40,856 --> 00:07:43,191
Then we got to record you one
right now.

196
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,427
No, no, no.
We couldn't do that.

197
00:07:45,494 --> 00:07:47,028
It was a long time ago.

198
00:07:47,096 --> 00:07:51,166
I've put this all behind me.

00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:52,667

[cheers and applause]

203
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,644
That was great.

204
00:08:02,712 --> 00:08:04,112
Oh, so good.
So good.

205
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,447
Yes!

206
00:08:05,514 --> 00:08:07,682
They're gonna love you
in Germany.

208
00:08:09,118 --> 00:08:11,519
Here's your super hot demo.

209
00:08:11,587 --> 00:08:12,620
Here's your briefcase.

210
00:08:12,688 --> 00:08:14,422
Yes!

211
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,458
And here's one

212
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:19,427
One-way ticket to Dusseldorf.

213
00:08:19,495 --> 00:08:23,331
Oh, what can I say, fellas,
except...

214
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,666
<i>Auf wiedersehen?</i>

216
00:08:27,336 --> 00:08:30,138
Hoo!
Yeah!

217
00:08:30,206 --> 00:08:31,573
Okay.

218
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,341
Now to tell Gustavo
our teacher bailed,

219
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:35,110
And we need to go
to the Palm Woods school and...

220
00:08:35,177 --> 00:08:36,244
[all scream]

221
00:08:36,312 --> 00:08:38,346
Oh, of course
you can go there.

222
00:08:38,414 --> 00:08:40,315
Now that your teacher
is off to Germany,

223
00:08:40,383 --> 00:08:42,117
There's really
no other option except...

224
00:08:42,184 --> 00:08:44,085
Kelly, get them another teacher!

225
00:08:44,153 --> 00:08:49,824
Someone untrickable!

226
00:08:49,892 --> 00:08:51,993
Man, we were so close.

227
00:08:52,061 --> 00:08:53,361
No, you weren't.

228
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:00,869
"does a bear
poop in the forest?

229
00:09:00,936 --> 00:09:05,273
It does if it takes poopenusil."

230
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:06,408
You know, sweetie,

231
00:09:06,475 --> 00:09:07,776
I think
you have a certain quality

232
00:09:07,843 --> 00:09:10,011
That no one else here has.

233
00:09:16,051 --> 00:09:19,354
I don't know if she's right
for a laxative commercial,

234
00:09:19,422 --> 00:09:20,655
But come back tomorrow.

235
00:09:20,723 --> 00:09:25,326
They want a cute kid
for a potato chip spot.

236
00:09:25,394 --> 00:09:26,628
Can I fire you?

237
00:09:26,695 --> 00:09:28,263
No, I'm your mother.

238
00:09:32,234 --> 00:09:33,635
So...

239
00:09:33,702 --> 00:09:35,703
You didn't like
your first teacher?

240
00:09:35,771 --> 00:09:37,272
Well, I didn't like him either.

241
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:39,541
The moment he felt the heat,
he ran for cover.

242
00:09:39,608 --> 00:09:40,608
But me?

243
00:09:40,676 --> 00:09:42,377
I'm battle-tested.

244
00:09:42,445 --> 00:09:43,578
I have a black belt,

245
00:09:43,646 --> 00:09:47,215
And I'm not afraid
to hit you with it.

246
00:09:47,283 --> 00:09:49,551
And there is nothing,

247
00:09:49,618 --> 00:09:53,621
Nothing you can say or do

248
00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:58,893
To get me to leave.

249
00:09:58,961 --> 00:10:00,929
Here's the keys
to the Porsche out front.

250
00:10:00,996 --> 00:10:04,599
Leave now and it's yours.

251
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:06,067
Kelly!

252
00:10:06,135 --> 00:10:07,802
Have you seen the keys to my...

253
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,238
[engine revving,
tires squealing]

254
00:10:10,306 --> 00:10:14,676
[Gustavo screaming]

255
00:10:14,743 --> 00:10:16,211
You know
he's not gonna give up.

256
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:17,612
Kelly,

257
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,415
A proper education
is very important to us,

258
00:10:20,483 --> 00:10:22,350
And this is a supply closet.

259
00:10:22,418 --> 00:10:24,552
Attention, students.

260
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,855
Please report
to principal Rocque's office.

261
00:10:26,922 --> 00:10:29,757
All students
to principal Rocque's office.

262
00:10:34,597 --> 00:10:37,065
Boys, I care about you.

263
00:10:37,132 --> 00:10:38,533
I do.

264
00:10:38,601 --> 00:10:41,603
And I would like to tell you
a story from my youth.

265
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,039
My principal was a jerk.

266
00:10:45,107 --> 00:10:48,076
And I vowed that some day

267
00:10:48,143 --> 00:10:49,744
I would be a principal;

268
00:10:49,812 --> 00:10:50,979
A good one...

269
00:10:51,046 --> 00:10:52,814
Fair,

270
00:10:52,882 --> 00:10:54,749
Pleasant...

271
00:10:54,817 --> 00:10:56,184
But you're
none of those things.

272
00:10:56,252 --> 00:10:58,720
Hey!
Things don't always work out!

273
00:10:58,787 --> 00:11:00,054
Bottom line is,

274
00:11:00,122 --> 00:11:02,390
You boys are staying
in the School of Rocque.

275
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,526
End of story.

276
00:11:04,593 --> 00:11:05,827
But, Gustavo...

277
00:11:05,895 --> 00:11:06,961
[tapping]

278
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:08,429
Principal Rocque.

279
00:11:08,497 --> 00:11:09,531
It's just,

280
00:11:09,598 --> 00:11:11,065
This school
isn't meeting our social

281
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:12,467
And educational needs.

282
00:11:12,535 --> 00:11:14,002
We need to go somewhere
that actually feels

283
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:15,103
Like a real school.

284
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,804
With girls.
- And field trips.

285
00:11:16,872 --> 00:11:18,106
And pie!

286
00:11:18,173 --> 00:11:20,975
You go to my school;
you play by my rules.

287
00:11:21,043 --> 00:11:24,178
And I will find a teacher
that will enforce those rules.

288
00:11:24,246 --> 00:11:28,082
A w.W.E. Superstar
super teacher!

289
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,450
[laughs]

290
00:11:29,518 --> 00:11:30,652
Who are you gonna get?

291
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:32,587
Chris "the masterpiece" masters?

292
00:11:32,655 --> 00:11:34,759
[laughs]

293
00:11:37,826 --> 00:11:42,230
[screaming]

294
00:11:42,298 --> 00:11:44,232
I did not see this coming.

295
00:11:52,528 --> 00:11:55,263
Okay, class,
let's get started.

296
00:11:55,331 --> 00:11:56,664
Is that really Chris masters?

297
00:11:56,732 --> 00:11:58,566
That's right.

298
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,301
W.W.E. Champion

299
00:12:00,369 --> 00:12:02,504
And the only
certified A.S.P.A. Teacher

300
00:12:02,571 --> 00:12:04,506
Trained to use the master lock.

301
00:12:04,573 --> 00:12:05,773
That's right.

302
00:12:05,841 --> 00:12:07,609
And I believe
that the key to a sound mind

303
00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:08,943
Is a healthy body.

304
00:12:09,044 --> 00:12:10,979
So throw your books away.

305
00:12:11,046 --> 00:12:13,681
Throw your books away.

306
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:14,916
All right.

307
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:15,984
Now I want you guys
to lift your desks.

308
00:12:16,051 --> 00:12:17,051
Excuse me?

309
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:19,954
Lift your desks!

310
00:12:20,022 --> 00:12:21,856
Now give me 500 desk presses!

311
00:12:21,924 --> 00:12:22,857
Count them out!

312
00:12:22,925 --> 00:12:23,958
All: [grunting]

313
00:12:24,026 --> 00:12:25,026
One...

314
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:26,161
Two...
- Up!

315
00:12:26,228 --> 00:12:27,195
All: Three...
- Up!

316
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,664
All: Four...
[screaming]

317
00:12:36,705 --> 00:12:38,907
I can't take another day
at the School of Rocque.

318
00:12:38,974 --> 00:12:40,675
I can't move my arms.

319
00:12:40,743 --> 00:12:42,043
Hey, guys!
High five!

320
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,711
[all moan]

321
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:45,947
Tyler,
what are you so excited about?

322
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:51,553
Miss Collins says we're
having class outside today!

323
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,888
All: Class outside...

324
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,760
All right, class,
it's time for geography,

325
00:12:58,827 --> 00:13:01,529
And you know what that means.

326
00:13:01,597 --> 00:13:03,131
Have fun!

327
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,067
[all cheering]

328
00:13:15,277 --> 00:13:16,778
Girls: Come o

329
00:13:16,845 --> 00:13:18,613
Come on!

330
00:13:18,681 --> 00:13:20,748
Co on!

331
00:13:20,816 --> 00:13:22,283
Come on!

332
00:13:22,351 --> 00:13:24,152
You're gonna be late for school.

333
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,020
Mine had globe beach balls.

334
00:13:26,088 --> 00:13:27,488
Mine had pool pie.

335
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,324
Mine had
a low student-teacher ratio.

336
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:32,393
But how are we gonna get rid
of Mr. Masterpiece?

337
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:34,929
My mom packed us corn chowder
for lunch today, right?

338
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:39,834
Katie Knight?

339
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,937
Katie Knight is next.

340
00:13:43,005 --> 00:13:45,540
We are going to get you into
that Palm Woods school today.

341
00:13:45,608 --> 00:13:47,308
So just go and be yourself.

342
00:13:47,376 --> 00:13:48,543
No, wait!
Don't be yourself.

343
00:13:48,611 --> 00:13:51,212
Be an angel who listens
and is polite.

344
00:13:53,882 --> 00:13:54,983
Okay, Katie,

345
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,251
Hold up the bag of chips;

346
00:13:56,318 --> 00:13:58,853
Look into the camera.

347
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,322
When you hear the crunch,
it's a chip.

348
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:05,326
But when you smell the crunch,
it's o'chippigans.

349
00:14:05,394 --> 00:14:08,796
And when you smell garbage,
it's this commercial.

350
00:14:08,864 --> 00:14:10,164
Excuse me?

351
00:14:10,232 --> 00:14:11,633
This stuff is nothing
but a heart attack

352
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,101
That goes good with dip.

353
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:15,270
I'd be better off
stepping in front of a bus...

354
00:14:15,337 --> 00:14:18,139
Of lard.

355
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,376
Katie!

356
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,845
Now let me jot down something

357
00:14:23,912 --> 00:14:26,047
On how fitness and body oil

358
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,349
Helps build
a strong immune system.

359
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:43,164
[retching]

360
00:14:43,232 --> 00:14:44,666
Whoa. Whoa.

361
00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:45,733
Whoa. Whoa.

362
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,069
Awesome: Chunky vomit!

363
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,837
Hey, don't touch that.

364
00:14:49,905 --> 00:14:51,239
Don't touch that.

365
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,574
Germs!

366
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,277
Oh, good!
- No.

367
00:14:56,345 --> 00:14:59,213
[all laughing
and shouting indistinctly]

368
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:01,382
[screams]

369
00:15:05,554 --> 00:15:07,989
Those kids are animals!

370
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,264
Thud!

371
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,434
The A.S.P.A.
Official school registry?

372
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:23,004
And it's filled with
every A.S.P.A.-Licensed teacher

373
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:26,274
That I can and will call.

374
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,709
Every time you chase one off,

375
00:15:27,776 --> 00:15:31,546
I have 10,000
waiting in the wings.

376
00:15:31,613 --> 00:15:33,247
Whoa!
Thud!

377
00:15:33,315 --> 00:15:35,516
It's a big book, guys.

378
00:15:35,584 --> 00:15:37,485
Your next teacher
will be here in 30 minutes.

379
00:15:37,553 --> 00:15:40,822
You play by my rules.

380
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:42,156
I win!

381
00:15:42,224 --> 00:15:44,759
I'm going to laugh
and leave victorious now.

382
00:15:44,827 --> 00:15:47,995
[laughs maniacally]

383
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:55,803
Well, I guess we can kiss
the Palm Woods school good-bye.

384
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,038
Maybe not.

385
00:15:57,106 --> 00:15:58,606
This isn't just
a list of teachers.

386
00:15:58,674 --> 00:16:01,609
It also has the rules every
A.S.P.A. School needs to follow.

387
00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:05,079
I smell brain.

388
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:07,582
Okay, according to this,
we're entitled to hot lunches,

389
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:10,284
Outdoor breaks, and
interscholastic sports programs.

390
00:16:10,352 --> 00:16:11,486
We didn't get any of that.

391
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,787
Exactly.

392
00:16:12,855 --> 00:16:15,022
So if Gustavo
wants to have a school here...

393
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,091
He's got to play
by these rules.

394
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:18,326
I smell plan.

395
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,564
Kelly!

396
00:16:23,632 --> 00:16:25,700
Which tie makes me look
more principally?

397
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:27,201
The ugly one.

398
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,479
Oh, hey, principal Rocque.

399
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:44,685
Hey!

400
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,020
I hope there's a good reason

401
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:49,123
My control room is filled
with your sweaty socks!

402
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:52,193
Well, A.S.P.A. Rule 209

403
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,896
States that all students
must have adequate storage

404
00:16:54,963 --> 00:16:56,397
For personal belongings.

405
00:16:56,465 --> 00:16:59,567
Which the School of Rocque
hasn't provided.

406
00:16:59,635 --> 00:17:01,102
Oh, I don't like the sound
of this.

407
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,917
Hey!

408
00:17:15,984 --> 00:17:18,453
That shelf is for my awards!

409
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,921
You wouldn't
want to be in violation

410
00:17:19,988 --> 00:17:22,089
Of A.S.P.A. Rules, would you?

411
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:26,427
You could lose your business.

412
00:17:26,495 --> 00:17:28,729
They're right.

413
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,332
Find a place for the dogs
to keep their smelly stuff,

414
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,168
Which is not in my office!

415
00:17:34,236 --> 00:17:36,070
And where's your teacher?

416
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,005
Yeah, we told him
A.S.P.A. Ensures teachers

417
00:17:38,073 --> 00:17:39,273
Five paid sick days

418
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:40,908
And two personal days a year.

419
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:45,246
Whoo-hoo!

420
00:17:45,347 --> 00:17:47,615
So long, suckers!

421
00:17:47,683 --> 00:17:49,584
[laughs]

422
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,319
Sounds like a personal day
to me.

423
00:17:51,386 --> 00:17:53,154
[whimpers]

424
00:17:56,091 --> 00:17:57,558
"all laundry detergents
fight stains.

425
00:17:57,626 --> 00:17:59,927
But for suds-o, it's personal."

426
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:00,895
I'm not saying this.

427
00:18:00,963 --> 00:18:02,330
Say it.

428
00:18:02,397 --> 00:18:05,266
We need to get you
into the Palm Woods school.

429
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,868
Why would they cast her?

430
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:09,270
She couldn't sell bacon
to a dog.

431
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,072
What if I kick your bacon?

432
00:18:11,139 --> 00:18:13,541
Don't stoop to his level,
honey.

433
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:14,709
Kids.

434
00:18:14,776 --> 00:18:17,111
Well, I think
she's just adorable,

435
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,446
The way she thinks
she has a chance

436
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,748
Against my Elliot.

437
00:18:20,816 --> 00:18:24,285
I mean, look at her.

438
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,753
Oh, it's on!

439
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:28,623
[growls]

440
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,324
Your mom is a freak!

441
00:18:30,392 --> 00:18:32,159
[grunts]

442
00:18:32,227 --> 00:18:33,694
Pile driver!

443
00:18:33,762 --> 00:18:35,096
Thud!

444
00:18:35,163 --> 00:18:37,365
[all grunting]

445
00:18:37,432 --> 00:18:39,200
Take it back!
- Uncle!

446
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:41,102
Okay, next up
is Katie Knight.

447
00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:44,071
Katie?

448
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:46,340
[grunting stops abruptly]

449
00:18:46,408 --> 00:18:49,377
She's not getting the part,
is she?

450
00:18:51,113 --> 00:18:52,380
Keep looking!

451
00:18:52,447 --> 00:18:53,414
There's got to be something
in this book

452
00:18:53,482 --> 00:18:54,715
That will make me win.

453
00:18:54,783 --> 00:18:56,083
I'm reading through it
for the fourth time!

454
00:18:56,151 --> 00:18:57,451
Read harder!

455
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:59,186
Just let them go to school
at the Palm Woods.

456
00:18:59,254 --> 00:19:01,022
The day I let them beat me
is the day I...

457
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:02,056
Is that a goat?

458
00:19:02,124 --> 00:19:03,558
[bleats]

459
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:04,825
[bleating continues]

460
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,894
Every A.S.P.A. School

461
00:19:06,962 --> 00:19:10,598
Has the right
to a school mascot.

462
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:14,936
[basketball horn blows]

463
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:17,605
You are familiar
with A.S.P.A.'s stance

464
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:19,440
On interscholastic athletics,
right?

465
00:19:19,508 --> 00:19:20,441
Huh?

466
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:21,742
Did you see our goat?

467
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,910
[bleats]

468
00:19:22,978 --> 00:19:24,145
We call him Gus.

469
00:19:24,212 --> 00:19:25,246
Gus Tavo.

470
00:19:25,314 --> 00:19:26,213
Get it?

471
00:19:26,315 --> 00:19:28,015
[buzzing]

472
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,483
Crowd: Win, tigers, win!

473
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:31,285
Win, tigers, win!

474
00:19:31,353 --> 00:19:32,787
Win, tigers, win!

475
00:19:32,854 --> 00:19:34,655
Win, tigers, win!

476
00:19:34,723 --> 00:19:36,691
Win, tigers, win!

477
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,459
Win, tigers, win!

478
00:19:38,527 --> 00:19:40,161
Win, tigers, win!
- [bleats]

479
00:19:40,228 --> 00:19:42,363
Win, tigers, win!

480
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,566
We're playing
the cast of <i>hopeless housewives.</i>

481
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:47,401
Oh, don't be fooled
by the score.

482
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:48,302
We're playing great.

483
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,837
[whistle blows]

484
00:19:49,905 --> 00:19:51,072
[yelps]

485
00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:53,741
[cheers and applause]

486
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:55,009
Go, goats!

487
00:19:55,077 --> 00:19:56,243
Whoo-hoo!

488
00:19:56,311 --> 00:19:57,578
Hey!

489
00:19:57,646 --> 00:20:01,248
Hey, if you can't beat them,
join them.

490
00:20:01,316 --> 00:20:03,551
[whistle blows]

491
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,819
Get out of my studio!

492
00:20:04,886 --> 00:20:05,853
Get out!
Come on!

493
00:20:05,921 --> 00:20:08,723
Get out...
- oh, I'm in.

494
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,391
[screams]

495
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,026
[scuffling]

496
00:20:12,094 --> 00:20:13,661
Come on, come on.

497
00:20:13,729 --> 00:20:15,396
Oh, James!
James!

498
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,898
[indistinct cheering]

499
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,200
[buzzer]

500
00:20:19,267 --> 00:20:21,102
[loud percussive crash]

501
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:23,504
[screams]

502
00:20:23,572 --> 00:20:28,275
[cheers and applause]

503
00:20:28,377 --> 00:20:30,144
Sorry, Gustavo.

504
00:20:30,212 --> 00:20:32,113
We'll get 'em next time.

505
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,514
Principal's office.

506
00:20:33,582 --> 00:20:34,915
Now!

507
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,553
I am the principal
of the school.

508
00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:41,589
And I do not give in to demands

509
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:45,993
And hooliganistic tactics
don't scare me.

510
00:20:46,094 --> 00:20:47,261
Sabotage?

511
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,196
Shmoobotage.

512
00:20:49,264 --> 00:20:50,197
You

513
00:20:50,265 --> 00:20:51,332
Cannot

514
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,601
Beat me!

515
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,303
Now, what you've done here
can not

516
00:20:56,371 --> 00:20:58,806
And will not go unpunished.

517
00:20:58,874 --> 00:21:01,542
Which is why I hereby

518
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,177
Expel you!

519
00:21:03,245 --> 00:21:04,512
What?

520
00:21:04,579 --> 00:21:05,479
What does that mean?

521
00:21:05,547 --> 00:21:07,014
It means...

522
00:21:07,082 --> 00:21:10,518
You are hereby kicked out
of the School of Rocque!

523
00:21:10,585 --> 00:21:13,621
Now get out.

524
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:14,822
Go on.

525
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,223
I guess...
[clears throat]

526
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,726
Move it!

527
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:21,362
[groans]

528
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,863
It wasn't easy,

529
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:24,765
But they needed
to be disciplined.

530
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,267
So from now on,
I'll pick the guys up

531
00:21:26,334 --> 00:21:27,334
From the Palm Woods school

532
00:21:27,402 --> 00:21:28,936
And bring them here by 12:30.

533
00:21:29,004 --> 00:21:30,237
Yep.

534
00:21:30,305 --> 00:21:33,441
[guys hooting and hollering]

535
00:21:36,078 --> 00:21:37,445
Kids don't always get along,

536
00:21:37,512 --> 00:21:39,013
But they do always get dirty.

537
00:21:39,081 --> 00:21:41,415
So if yours are mud-magnets
like mine,

538
00:21:41,483 --> 00:21:43,918
Be sure to use
suds-o laundry detergent.

539
00:21:43,985 --> 00:21:48,622
The only detergent
that knocks out stains.

540
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:49,757
Nice job.

541
00:21:49,825 --> 00:21:53,427
I am loving this town.

542
00:21:53,495 --> 00:21:55,396
So am I.

543
00:22:00,535 --> 00:22:01,602
Okay.

544
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:06,373
Time to do school,
Palm Woods style.

545
00:22:06,441 --> 00:22:10,144
Hello, ladies.

546
00:22:10,212 --> 00:22:12,480
Okay, class,
let's start with science.

547
00:22:12,547 --> 00:22:15,683
Where we're gonna talk about
water displacement.

548
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,586
[guys all screaming
and shouting]

549
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:28,095
[shouting continues]

550
00:22:36,138 --> 00:22:37,872
