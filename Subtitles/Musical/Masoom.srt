1
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:08,666
She is calling you. There's very
little time, please hurry.

2
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:06,724
As per Ms. Bhavna's will...

3
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:10,522
...her son, Rahul's inheritance
has been entrusted to you.

4
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:17,928
Are you her relative?

5
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,238
No.

6
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,275
Did you know her since long?

7
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,776
Since the time she was in school.

8
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:34,317
The inheritance she's left for
her son has been put in a Trust.

9
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,819
Once all the documents are ready,
they will be sent to you.

10
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,228
Where will you
take the child now?

11
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,334
Does yourfamily live there...

12
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,835
No. l live alone.

13
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,874
Will you look after a small child
in this old age?

14
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:00,309
l mean...

15
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,338
...doesn't he have a father?

16
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:14,354
Anyway, once the documents are
ready, we will send them to you.

17
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,937
Take him away!
...Mummy! Take him away!

18
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:56,019
-What's the matter?
- Sister, take the dog away!

19
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,889
-Who brought it?
- Papa did.

20
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,894
-You're scared of a tiny dog?!
- No way! l'm not scared.

21
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,895
You aren't, right? Now watch!

22
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,403
No! l'll tell mummy!

23
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,903
You aren't scared, right? Look!

24
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,947
This point here...
Please let there be light.

25
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,346
You had to provide ramps
from here to this point.

26
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,987
And what are
these proportions! Are you...

27
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,995
Speak softly, my dear.
What's the matter?

28
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,998
What did the dog do?

29
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:45,502
l'll be home soon.
ls your mummy there?

30
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,039
No? ...Thank God!

31
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:50,038
And listen! lf she
returns soon, don't tell her.

32
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:53,542
l'll be there before she does.
...Yes, my dear!

33
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,047
My wife loves dogs, sir.

34
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,840
My wife hates them.

35
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:09,960
You get dead tired, going out
in this city in the traffic!

36
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:11,960
l left at 4 O'clock!

37
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:16,967
Here are your colour pencils.
Don't lose them again.

38
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:22,006
Where has the flower vase gone
from here? Who has removed it?

39
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,574
Abdul, get me some water.

40
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,551
-Where has the flower vase gone?
- l don't know.

41
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:37,554
Nobody in this house
ever knows anything!

42
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:39,824
Here are your pencils.

43
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:48,565
Hey! Who's kept a cactus
in place of the photo frame?

44
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:55,072
She's always missing!
She's never at home!

45
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:00,542
Why are all of you
sitting so quietly?

46
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,519
Hear, hear!
Can't we sit quietly at home?

47
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:12,022
lndeed! l know what it means
when all of you sit quietly!

48
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,024
Papa, mummy is going to
the bathroom to wash herface.

49
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:19,357
Oh! We'll be damned!

50
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:23,031
lndu... uh... are you
going to the bathroom?

51
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:26,035
What!

52
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,036
Are you going to wash yourface?

53
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,405
-Why?
- For no reason.

54
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,078
l've heard that washing the face
too much spoils the skin.

55
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,078
Where did you hearthat?

56
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,080
Well... Mini was saying so.

57
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,684
No, papa! Sister said so.

58
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:44,118
No! Even l didn't say so! ...
Mummy, l'd heard it on the radio.

59
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,124
-Yes! We'd heard it on the radio.
-What's wrong with all of you?!

60
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,130
We are doomed now!

61
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,197
Yes.

62
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:07,044
Take this dog away!
Who brought it here?!

63
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,046
l said, take the dog away!

64
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,084
Who brought it here?!

65
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:16,654
l asked, who brought it here?!

66
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,592
Let's go.

67
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:25,095
l knew it!

68
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,357
- Please let the dog stay here.
- Quiet!

69
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,102
The dog broke a photo frame,
a flower vase and tore a curtain!

70
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,671
These were the disasters
struck on the very first day!

71
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:38,139
lt'll destroy the whole house in
no time! Who'll take care of it?

72
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,142
We'll put a leash around it.

73
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:43,339
There's no need!
Who asked you to get it?!

74
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:48,686
Bela is not yet here!
She is always missing!

75
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:53,185
l'm warning you,
l will not keep the dog!

76
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,194
How often have l said,
throw away those glasses!

77
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,628
Hey! How will l read then!

78
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,199
-You look just like a peon!
- So what?

79
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,240
How's your backache?

80
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:14,712
lt's okay now but l had to
stand in the site for 2-3 hours.

81
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,245
l'll massage it.

82
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,784
Why do you have to work so much?

83
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:25,287
Come off it! l work for
you and your children.

84
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:29,292
Stop it! ...
You are fond of working!

85
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,293
We have everything.

86
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,295
Everything is what we don't have.

87
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,799
What do we lack?

88
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,302
A diamond necklace.

89
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,302
Well, who wants one!

90
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:45,843
Oh really! Then, why were you
lustily eyeing Kanta's necklace?

91
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:49,846
Nonsense! l was looking at it
because it was so ugly!

92
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:50,914
l see.

93
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,887
Forget the necklace but you'd
surely want a husband like hers?

94
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,886
Get me the most precious gem, yet
l wouldn't want a man like Suri.

95
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,822
What kind of
a husband do you want?

96
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,264
l have one.

97
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:12,262
Yes, you do. But do sing praises
about him sometimes!

98
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,809
Shall l say something?

99
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,313
Let's keep the puppy at home?

100
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,312
You sly monkey!

101
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:29,512
Yuck! l'm not going to
drink this! There's cream in it!

102
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:32,355
Nothing doing! Drink the milk!

103
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,924
Keep your hand down!

104
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,357
How will l drink my coffee then?!

105
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,791
Use the other hand.

106
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,794
Keep papa's name as puppy.

107
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,956
Stupid! Keep the puppy's
name as papa!

108
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,969
Stop fighting
early in the morning!

109
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,371
-Allow me to take the coffee.
- No!

110
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,905
The puppy drinks milk,
not coffee.

111
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:53,409
l'm not talking about
the puppy... but about papa.

112
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,413
Shall we name him also Mini?

113
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,415
ls that a name!

114
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,316
Naming him Mini
will create a problem.

115
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,319
lf we call the puppy,
you'll come running...

116
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,822
...and if we call you,
it will come running!

117
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,826
When there will be no dog,
what's the use of finding a name?

118
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,826
Have you had your vitamins?

119
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:16,833
- Have you?
-Yes, papa.

120
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:19,334
- l'm asking you also.
-Yes, even l've had it.

121
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,931
Papa, you lie?

122
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,921
Don't forget we have to go to
Mr. Suri's party in the evening.

123
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,926
There's a tank
filled with hot water.

124
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:48,931
ln it, your host, his wife
and you are almost naked!

125
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:54,438
The pressure of the hot water
massages your body!

126
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,835
And you get tickled all over.

127
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,346
-Adjust yourtie properly!
-What's wrong with it?

128
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:03,846
-You've come for a party.
- lt's okay.

129
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:05,540
Hey, you Late Kate!

130
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,989
- Suri, how are you?
-Absolutely fine.

131
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,888
Mr. Suri, DK will not
drink too much today.

132
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,029
- The question does not arise!
- lndeed! He gets high with 2 pegs!

133
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,896
And listen... please don't
recite couplets either!

134
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,399
l can't promise that.

135
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,404
All right! But do everything
within your limits, DK!

136
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,942
Let's have a very large peg.

137
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,877
l had no idea that
there'd be so many people.

138
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,947
Bring a glass of
champagne for him.

139
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,515
We'll have a large peg later.

140
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,086
Listen to what l say!

141
00:13:55,601 --> 00:14:00,868
Son, he makes films. Deliver
the dialogues from Sholay'.

142
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,408
''How many men were there?''
''Two, sir.''

143
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:07,410
''And you were three.
Yet, you returned empty-handed!''

144
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,979
He's good, isn't he?

145
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,450
You were to phone me
day before yesterday!

146
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,450
l was busy, l had to go out.

147
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,953
You are always busy
with your work!

148
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:20,455
You were going to
quit smoking, weren't you?

149
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,958
- From tomorrow.
- Tomorrow indeed!

150
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:35,972
Hadn't you worn the
same one for Sheetal's party?

151
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,506
They are very beautiful.

152
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,507
- Hasn't Ratna come?
- l did call her.

153
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:42,010
But you know her condition.

154
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:45,514
ldiot! She keeps crying, and that
too away from her husband's eyes.

155
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,515
She doesn't protest by
eitherfighting or crying!

156
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,709
Meaning?

157
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:05,936
Remember, DK, in those days,
your athleticism...

158
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,973
And my naughtiness...

159
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,474
How many girls went crazy!

160
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,978
Any letters from the Major?

161
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,477
lt's a thing of the past.
Forget it!

162
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,085
Have you forgotten?

163
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:25,517
Why do you worry?
Don't l look fine?

164
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:32,026
''Raise not your hands
and arch backwards''

165
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:37,032
''Take a look at your bosom''

166
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:39,102
''As slowly
slides down your veil''

167
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,738
Wow! What a couplet!

168
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:46,542
Remember, there was a song...

169
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:54,085
''O' lovely maiden, walk not
with your nose in the air''

170
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,621
Should we sing?

171
00:15:58,223 --> 00:15:59,622
Will you sing?

172
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:09,999
l have a bad throat.
Why don't you begin?

173
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,501
- Putting up your price, huh?
- No way!

174
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,541
You start, l'll join you.

175
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,046
What are you doing!

176
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,954
- How is Ratna now?
- l don't know.

177
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,012
Lie straight.

178
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:03,920
No, Ratna, don't cry.

179
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:16,933
Was your problem solved by
swallowing sleeping pills? ...No!

180
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,935
You should have given them
to your husband instead!

181
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:22,938
Orto his mistress!

182
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:24,972
What will you gain by dying?!

183
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:28,601
Quiet, Chanda! ls this
the time to scold her?!

184
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:37,982
You're here?

185
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:40,523
What have you come to take now?!

186
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:45,562
You've put Ratna in this state!
What more do you want to do?!

187
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:47,631
- Please be quiet, Chanda.
-Why should l?!

188
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,529
Somebody has to speak!

189
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,534
Should everyone be quiet like her
and let this man do as he please?

190
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,535
Let's go... We'll leave now.

191
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,437
Think and talk!

192
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:05,947
lf you were in her shoes,
would you think and talk?!

193
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:12,989
Sleeping pills
do not solve problems.

194
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:16,492
But her husband is also crazy.

195
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:18,993
How can he change,
even after having children?

196
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:22,993
lf you can't bearthe
responsibility, why get married?

197
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:28,505
Mummy, if l were not born,
what would have happened?

198
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:33,043
Then there would have been
a baby boy in your place!

199
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:34,200
My brother.

200
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:38,013
- Not yours but mine!
- He'd have been my brothertoo.

201
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:40,684
How would he, stupid!
You wouldn't be born!

202
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:45,520
Don't! Does one talk this way
with an elder sister?

203
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,590
Does one speak this way
with a younger sister?

204
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,590
l'll beat you!
You call me stupid!

205
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,598
Hey, you'll fall!

206
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:59,102
That's enough now!

207
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:04,007
Go to your room.

208
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,550
lndu, suppose you
had a baby boy, then?

209
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:16,552
l have one.

210
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:20,056
Where is he?
Have you hidden him?

211
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,560
Here he is!
lsn't he enough for me?

212
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:31,328
Why?

213
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:37,073
You have one, l don't.

214
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:44,080
You don't even tell me whether
l've received a reply or not.

215
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:47,115
lf there was, then l'd have
come to you immediately.

216
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,651
Why do you worry when l'm around?

217
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:53,656
Worried, l certainly am.

218
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:57,660
About this boy.
After all, l'm getting older.

219
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:01,026
Here, send him
a telegram this time.

220
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:04,533
Get yourself treated properly.

221
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:07,536
- ls there a cure for old age?
-Why do you talk like this...

222
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:10,572
Go and send
a telegram immediately.

223
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:27,123
- There's a telegram.
- From whom?

224
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,120
From Nainital?

225
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:35,630
He's asked you to come at once,
as there's some important work.

226
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:41,672
-Who is he?
- The headmaster of my old school.

227
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:47,677
-Anything important?
- l don't know.

228
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,177
He has never before...

229
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,682
- l haven't met him since years.
- Then?

230
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,718
l'll phone him from office.

231
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:14,103
Gupta, check this.

232
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,139
Bring it in.

233
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:28,684
Mr. Dhawan is waiting foryou.

234
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:30,684
- ls the new client here?
-Yes.

235
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:32,686
-What's his name?
- Mr. Bansal.

236
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:37,784
Listen... get me a trunk call
to Nainital. This is the number.

237
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,740
And this is the embassy.

238
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:53,742
And yes! This is Neelkamal
Building, of which you mentioned.

239
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,247
These are its schematic designs.

240
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:02,148
Come, DK. We were waiting
foryou... This is Mr. Bansal.

241
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:05,654
Please sit, DK.

242
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:14,661
He wants to build a complex -
Bansal Bhavan... is that the name?

243
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:17,666
He wants us
to give him a proposal.

244
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:20,669
You will be giving
the first presentation.

245
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:24,707
l was showing him the schematic
designs of Neelkamal Building.

246
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,210
-You explain to him.
- Sure.

247
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,214
No. Mr. Gurudayal has retired.

248
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:35,251
- Please give me his phone number.
- He doesn't have a phone.

249
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,217
Who's speaking?

250
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:40,256
DK from Delhi. l've received
a telegram from Mr. Gurudayal.

251
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:43,258
-Are you DK Malhotra?
-Yes. Who are you?

252
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:45,259
My name is Tiwari.

253
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:49,766
l had sent you the telegram.
The master had sent a lettertoo.

254
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:51,765
- l haven't received the letter.
-You haven't?

255
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,269
But l did get his telegram.
Mr. Tiwari, what work did he have?

256
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:56,770
lt's something very personal...

257
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:01,807
-What work did he have?
-Are you really DK Malhotra?

258
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:06,148
Yes, l am DK speaking!
What work did he have?

259
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,716
He's asked you to come
to Nainital. Your son...

260
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:13,791
What did the master say?

261
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,816
He says he has
very little time, and...

262
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:19,225
All right! But what
work does he have with me?

263
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:22,423
He wants you to take away
your son from here.

264
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:24,426
Son!

265
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:26,735
Whose son?

266
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:31,274
l have no son.
What are you talking about?!

267
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,777
Hello, Mr. Tiwari?!

268
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:47,321
What is the matter? Do you know
what else the master has said?

269
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:49,551
Yes. A small boy
lives in his house.

270
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:52,328
Since the time his mother
left him with the master...

271
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,829
Hello! Who's left him?

272
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:56,830
His mother - Bhavna.

273
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,239
l see.

274
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,211
Yes, Mr. Tiwari? ...

275
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,799
-Worked up about something?
- No.

276
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:36,339
Did you phone Nainital?

277
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:41,343
Yes. The master was not there but
l spoke to a man named Mr. Tiwari.

278
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:42,912
lndu, he said...

279
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:49,885
What did he say?

280
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:53,389
He said that
the master was unwell...

281
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,392
The line was bad,
l couldn't hear properly.

282
00:29:56,561 --> 00:30:00,395
But he did say that
the master was unwell.

283
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,396
Send him some money
for his treatment.

284
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:05,400
- lndu, that's not all.
- Then what is it?

285
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,798
l have some problem.

286
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:18,414
What is that problem
of yours which isn't mine?

287
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:26,056
What is it?

288
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:28,991
Nothing.

289
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:32,495
lt's an office problem.

290
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,048
- lt's me.
-Yes, lndu?

291
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,047
There's a letterfrom Nainital.
Shall l read it?

292
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:57,585
- Have you read it?
- No. l've not even opened it.

293
00:30:57,755 --> 00:30:59,586
- Shall l open it?
- No, don't.

294
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:03,456
l'll come home in the evening
and read it. Okay?

295
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:09,465
Or l'll send the office peon.
Give it to him.

296
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:23,512
Anita, cancel all appointments.

297
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:47,570
''DK, she never wanted you
to know about this child.''

298
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:51,106
''When l learnt about it
afterthe child was born...

299
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:54,109
...Bhavna had said
just one thing.''

300
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:59,615
''Do not tell DK, since he has
his own life... his own family.'''

301
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:09,025
''That child
neither laughs nor cries.''

302
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:12,526
''He keeps staring out
of the window all day long.''

303
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,597
''Waiting for, l wonder, whom.''

304
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:19,032
''lt appears as if his childhood
is vanishing at such a young age.''

305
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:22,036
''l cannot give him anything
in my old age.''

306
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:28,076
''He needs a mother,
a father... a family, DK.''

307
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:34,378
''He asks me questions whose
answers l can't give, you can.''

308
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:44,122
''Son, l won't live
very long now.''

309
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:48,129
''Before l die, l want
to send your son to you.''

310
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:08,943
Mummy, shout at her!

311
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:11,086
Stupid, shut it!

312
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:14,089
You stupid! They are
showing Chintu's songs!

313
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:18,093
- Mummy, ask herto shut it!
- Concentrate here!

314
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:20,254
What to do about this?

315
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:23,599
- Make blocks of these sums.
- How do you do that?

316
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:26,100
That's what l don't know,
so l'm asking you.

317
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,101
O God! Your New Math is tough!

318
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,105
Mini, stop your chorus!

319
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:32,640
They are showing Chintu's songs.

320
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,641
ls Chintu your uncle?!

321
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,079
Shut it!

322
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:40,183
Mummy, please! They're showing
Uncle Chintu's songs!

323
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,648
lt's disturbing.

324
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,185
Forget that.
Mummy, first tell me...

325
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:46,188
Stop it, Mini!

326
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,690
Mummy, l stand first in all the
other subjects except Maths...

327
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:54,196
Papa, you're here!

328
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,698
Papa, they were showing Uncle
Chintu's songs but mummy shut it!

329
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,700
Who's Uncle Chintu?

330
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,567
Damn! How many times have l
told you about Uncle Chintu!

331
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:06,608
Quiet! ...Papa, ljust
cannot solve this sum.

332
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,109
Ask mummy.

333
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:11,612
She doesn't know.
You explain, papa.

334
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:16,151
No way! Thank God, you've come.
You handle them!

335
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:19,655
-Will you have tea?
-Yes. - Papa, please explain!

336
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,657
-Add little sugar.
- Papa, solve the sum first.

337
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:23,657
Fine.

338
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:29,159
Doing Winky's homework
is beyond me.

339
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,667
ln any case, l was weak in Math.

340
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:34,669
And l don't know about these new
blocks to be made in New Math.

341
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:36,670
From now on, you manage her.

342
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,177
lf that fatso stands first in
class, Winky will not forgive me!

343
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,213
Get up!

344
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:47,751
Won't you change your clothes?

345
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,756
l want to tell you something.

346
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,354
Go ahead.

347
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:00,831
You won't like it.

348
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:04,826
What's it?

349
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:08,830
Let it be.
l'll tell you some othertime.

350
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,174
lt's nothing.

351
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,675
Please, DK! Don't say this.

352
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,219
What is it?

353
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:32,728
There was another girl in my life.

354
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:41,737
- Don't joke about such matters.
- l am not joking, lndu.

355
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,781
l am not joking.

356
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:01,687
When l... had gone... there...

357
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:05,193
-Where?
- To Nainital.

358
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:08,697
Forthe school's
Old Boys' function...

359
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,199
At that time...

360
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,699
...Winky was going to be born.

361
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:15,970
Yes.

362
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,744
l'd met herthere.

363
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,076
Who?

364
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:28,943
Bhavna... that girl.

365
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:34,789
l...

366
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:39,795
l don't know...
how l couldn't control myself.

367
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:45,801
Perhaps because l was alone,
and... so was she.

368
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:49,304
l went to her house once and...

369
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:53,342
...at her insistence,
l stayed back at night.

370
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:57,813
l shouldn't have stayed back...
l shouldn't have stayed but...

371
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:10,259
l never ever saw her
afterthat... l swear!

372
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:14,262
And even then, l shared
nothing special with her.

373
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,765
You shared nothing special?!

374
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:23,271
What can be more special
than this, DK?

375
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:32,605
So, what does she want now?

376
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,145
Nothing. She's dead.

377
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:41,049
Then?

378
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:48,864
She has a son from me.

379
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:55,063
No! Don't say that!

380
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:59,875
What's happening!
Please don't say that!

381
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,280
l'm very scared.

382
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:20,829
Winky dear, go and sleep.

383
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,334
You said you've been busy.
So what brings you here today?

384
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:35,404
l want to talk to you...
There's a big problem.

385
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:41,442
With Bansal? lf you want, l'll
phone him now and fix matters.

386
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,446
- No. Listen to me.
- Tell me something.

387
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:48,984
lf your company acquires that
contract, what'll be your share?

388
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:50,984
- That's not the problem.
- Then?

389
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:52,986
- lt's something else.
- Then, let's solve the problem!

390
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:54,988
Mr. Suri, how was the game?

391
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:59,994
Please don't joke. Doing business
and drinking whisky is my forte.

392
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,496
Else, even l would be preparing
for Wimbledon like my son!

393
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:09,002
DK, the joy of
watching your son grow!

394
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:12,200
lt wasn't the same
even in my youth!

395
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:17,040
A son is important.

396
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:20,547
Your son must be handling
your business now, right?

397
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,048
l'll leave now.

398
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:25,086
Hey, you wanted to discuss
a problem. What is it?

399
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,091
-What's it?
-We'll talk later.

400
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:50,646
Yes, l will inform him.

401
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:07,562
Mr. Bansal, this is
a foundation problem.

402
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:10,063
As per Mr. Malhotra's
original estimates...

403
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:13,067
...you'll find mica content
at a depth of 40 feet.

404
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:14,568
But as perthe...

405
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:18,106
Sorry, sir.
l have to go home.

406
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:43,165
- lndu, where are you going?
-Anywhere! ...l don't know!

407
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,165
Please listen to me!

408
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,667
l don't want to listen!

409
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:49,671
Please listen to me for a minute!

410
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:57,212
l didn't know that the boy
was going to come here.

411
00:41:57,381 --> 00:42:00,214
- Stop lying!
- l swear, l didn't know!

412
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,081
Come what may, that boy is
not going to come to this house!

413
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:06,120
- Do you need the taxi or not?
-We don't want it!

414
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:12,627
Take this.

415
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,129
lndu, listen!
Just for a few days!

416
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:19,633
Please, lndu! What can l
do now if he's coming here?

417
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:21,634
Do what you want, but he
is not going to come here!

418
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:25,673
l promise he won't stay here
for more than 2-3 days.

419
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:27,174
l promise.

420
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:29,403
l do not trust you anymore!

421
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:36,219
You'd said, my problem is yours
too. Won't you help me this time?

422
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:40,221
Mummy, ask sisterto return
my scented rubber!

423
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,326
Quiet! lt was my rubber!
So what if l took it?!

424
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:46,724
What do you want?! That you
do any wrong and l endure it?!

425
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:50,731
l'm also human, l have feelings.
Have you everthought about that?

426
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:54,236
And these children...
what will you tell them?!

427
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,430
l'll beat you! ...
Mummy, just look at her!

428
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,235
Mummy, two of my sums were
wrong!

429
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:03,540
Come on, l'll show you.

430
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,648
Come on, mummy!

431
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:11,548
Papa, please carry me.

432
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:19,189
Now take me inside.

433
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:28,203
Mini and Winky, please come here.

434
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:30,739
What's it?

435
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:34,243
A boy will be coming
to stay in our house.

436
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:36,538
-Who is he?
- His name is...

437
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:44,787
His mummy is dead,
so he's coming to stay with us.

438
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,786
But who was his mummy?

439
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:52,293
She was our distant relative.

440
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,693
Mummy, how old is he?

441
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:56,798
He...

442
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:04,206
He is 8-9 years old.

443
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:09,677
Such a small boy! My exams are
nearing, he won't let me study!

444
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,711
No. He'll play with me.

445
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:15,214
Where is his father?
Why doesn't he go to him?

446
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:19,254
His father has gone away.

447
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:21,256
Leaving him behind?

448
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:26,756
My papa would have
never done that!

449
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,763
Children, go to
your room and sleep.

450
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:39,305
- Come on, hurry.
- lt will be great fun now!

451
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:40,807
lt will be no fun!

452
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:44,813
You took care.

453
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:48,351
l was taking care of my children!

454
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:31,121
Shall l roll the window down?

455
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:06,294
Look, that's the Old Fort.

456
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:12,096
lt's a... very old... fort!

457
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:16,702
lt was built by Sher Shah Suri
...or perhaps Humayun...

458
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:20,809
There's a big zoo inside now.
There are many animals and a...

459
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:22,842
Did you know my mummy?

460
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,349
Y... y... yes. Yes, l did know her.

461
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:28,950
And papa?

462
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:33,183
Not papa.

463
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:40,896
Mummy used to say that
l'll surely find my papa.

464
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:46,401
Even mummy is no more. lf papa
does come, how will he find me?

465
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:51,406
He will, son... he will find you.

466
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:04,852
Mini, he is Rahul.

467
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:09,855
Winky dear, come here.

468
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:13,858
Rahul, she is Winky.

469
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:19,367
She is my mummy...
Mummy, he is Rahul.

470
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:28,870
Will Rahul sleep in my room?

471
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:31,013
No. His bed has been
put in the study.

472
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,915
But l study there.

473
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:37,450
My dear, it's a matter
of only a few days.

474
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:41,456
Abdul, keep his baggage
in the study.

475
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:50,965
Both of you come upstairs.

476
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,378
Get up, this is my place.
l sit with papa.

477
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:18,926
Go and sit there.

478
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:36,443
Abdul... has not brought the rice.

479
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:04,872
l had a puppy
whose name was also Mini.

480
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:06,441
Eat quietly, Mini.

481
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,578
When papa used to call
the puppy, l'd come running.

482
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:11,915
And when he'd call me,
the puppy would come running.

483
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:16,248
Mummy is upset today.

484
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:33,501
lndu, aren't you going to eat?

485
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:28,055
Son.

486
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:36,871
What are you
doing all alone here?

487
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:38,904
Gazing at the stars.

488
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:44,378
Mummy used to say that
if you see a shooting star...

489
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:46,913
...your wish gets fulfilled.

490
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:52,453
Look, uncle, a shooting star!

491
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:55,115
-Where is it?
- lt's disappeared.

492
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:57,952
- Did you wish for something?
-Yes.

493
00:54:58,261 --> 00:55:00,320
-What?
- l can't tell you.

494
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:02,329
Why?

495
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:10,335
l see... Should we go inside?

496
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:17,878
Yes?

497
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:20,479
Shall l tell you
what l wished for?

498
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:27,922
l prayed that l'd find my papa.

499
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:37,725
Come on, papa, it's getting late.

500
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:40,935
Papa, come on.
lt's getting very late.

501
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:42,503
He's taking so long.

502
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:55,516
The children are getting late.

503
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:13,401
Did you know my mummy?

504
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:17,404
No!

505
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,740
But uncle knew her.

506
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:25,946
l know!

507
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:47,001
What is it? Why are you
looking at me that way?

508
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:51,506
Even my mummy used to wear
a similarfloral print sari.

509
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:56,044
Fine... Let me work now.

510
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:08,956
And how have you let
that boy stay in your house?!

511
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:14,461
l haven't. He just came home.

512
00:57:16,065 --> 00:57:17,965
What could l do?

513
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:24,768
Whenever l see him,
l think of DK and that girl.

514
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:30,478
Chanda, it seems as if
all relationships are a farce.

515
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:34,014
lt seems as if...

516
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:39,451
...such incidents occur
only in other people's lives.

517
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:47,459
l don't know what to do now.

518
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:15,022
lndu, the weakeryou become,
the more you will have to endure.

519
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:20,823
Yes, l'll be there.

520
00:58:22,131 --> 00:58:23,530
l'll be back in a jiffy.

521
00:58:42,218 --> 00:58:47,121
When the Major left me,
even l'd felt defeated like you.

522
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:49,622
But look at me now.
What do l lack?

523
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:54,627
l work, l live for myself,
...the way l want to!

524
00:58:55,231 --> 00:58:57,131
Like a free woman.

525
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:02,802
And don't you miss your son?

526
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:11,545
5+...

527
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:15,047
- Shall l recite a poetry foryou?
- No need! l'm studying!

528
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:18,085
l said, l'm studying!

529
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:21,587
''Who created
the sparrows that fly?''

530
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:24,688
-All right, l'll go.
- l'll beat you!

531
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:29,096
Brother Rahul.

532
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:32,360
Shall l recite a poetry foryou?

533
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:34,601
Yes, please.

534
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:43,640
''Who created
the sparrows that fly?''

535
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:50,685
''Who created you and me?''

536
00:59:53,289 --> 00:59:56,690
''The Lord is present in everything''

537
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:03,197
Whose picture is this?

538
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:04,765
My papa's.

539
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:07,196
ls this how your papa looks?

540
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:10,203
l don't know.
Perhaps this is how he looks.

541
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:11,806
Where's he?

542
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:17,745
He must be dead.

543
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:21,748
No! Mummy used to say that
he has gone very far away.

544
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:23,851
And that he'd
surely return someday.

545
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:29,788
l'd seen another child's father
go somewhere far away, on TV.

546
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:32,792
His mummy too had said that
his father would return.

547
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:35,897
But he was dead.
And the boy didn't even know!

548
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:38,299
Films are not reality.

549
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:41,301
Yes, indeed. They are films.

550
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:44,099
l'll tell papa.
He'll find yourfather.

551
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,839
How will he find him?

552
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:51,811
My papa is very clever.
Watch, he will find yourfather!

553
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,915
Mini! ...What are you doing here?

554
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:56,384
Playing with Brother Rahul.

555
01:00:56,552 --> 01:00:57,951
Go and sleep.

556
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:03,257
Since when did Rahul
become your brother?!

557
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:11,265
What's that you're swallowing?

558
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:12,765
Sleeping pills.

559
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:19,306
Will taking sleeping pills
solve anything?

560
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:25,813
How often have
l apologised to you!

561
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:30,352
How often have l admitted
that l've indeed made a mistake!

562
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:32,853
Can't you forget it?

563
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:35,856
How can l?

564
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:38,791
l was leading a farcical
relationship for 1 0 years!

565
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:41,156
You cheated me for 1 0 years!

566
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:44,865
You call
this relationship a farce?!

567
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:49,369
Are you calling those
two children a farce?

568
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:52,907
- lf our children are...
- Even she had a child.

569
01:01:53,509 --> 01:01:55,409
Will you call that a farce?

570
01:02:01,818 --> 01:02:07,279
Believe me, l was totally
ignorant about this child.

571
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:10,824
- lf l had known...
-What would you have done then?!

572
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:13,327
Left us?!

573
01:02:15,431 --> 01:02:17,331
Don't touch me!

574
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:41,421
Hello. ls that
Mr. DK Malhotra speaking?

575
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:43,423
My name is...

576
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:47,428
Hey, l'm Suri here.

577
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:50,428
You've become very lazy!
Do you know it's Sunday today?

578
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:54,036
Do you have to visit sites today?
Aren't you coming to the farm?

579
01:02:54,537 --> 01:02:58,439
No, Suri. l can't come.
l am not in the mood.

580
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:02,306
Not in the mood?
l'll take care of your mood!

581
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,143
Suri, listen! l think
even lndu isn't in the mood.

582
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:11,584
Are you lndu's uncle?!
Give the line to her.

583
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:16,390
Well, Mr. Moody? Moods become
all right when with friends.

584
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:20,886
Come, Brother Rahul.
...Come on.

585
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:25,399
Hello, Uncle Suri!
How are you?

586
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:28,902
Hello, child!
How were your exams?

587
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:30,402
They haven't begun as yet.

588
01:03:30,606 --> 01:03:32,938
Hey! Whose cute child is this?

589
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:35,443
My word! He is so sweet!

590
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:37,010
Whose son is he?

591
01:03:39,048 --> 01:03:40,447
Well, who is he?

592
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:45,847
He's Brother Rahul. His mother is
dead and his papa has gone away.

593
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:03,170
Why didn't you come
for Chulbul's party?

594
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:07,806
- Don't hit the plants!
-Why not?

595
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,001
They belong to my father!
l will break them!

596
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:13,414
They also have life,
they too will get hurt.

597
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,414
Rubbish! Who says so?!

598
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:17,813
- My mother used to say that.
-Your mother is dead! - Don't!

599
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:24,958
Papa, Babbu hit Brother Rahul.

600
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:27,461
Babbu hit Rahul? lmpossible!

601
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:30,463
l saw Babbu hit him.

602
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:35,469
Come here.

603
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:42,510
- Did you hit Rahul?
- No, l didn't hit him.

604
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:45,511
l told you so.
My Babbu never hits anybody.

605
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:48,946
- He's lying. He hit him.
-All right. Let's go.

606
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,140
Come, son.

607
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:52,553
-What will you drink?
- Thums up.

608
01:05:05,534 --> 01:05:07,866
Did Babbu hit you?

609
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:09,936
No, he didn't.

610
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,474
Who will play cricket?

611
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:14,974
Come on, everyone!

612
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:17,476
- My turn first!
- Let's toss.

613
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,479
- Give it to him.
- My turn first.

614
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:22,473
- Kids afterthe elders.
- No. Elders afterthe kids.

615
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:30,524
The kids have finished their
turn. Now it's the elders' turn.

616
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:32,524
DK, bowl a googly!

617
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:36,530
Watchman! What are you doing?!

618
01:05:40,636 --> 01:05:42,331
Leave me! ...This is cheating!

619
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:47,074
l made it!

620
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:50,578
Mr. Umpire, your place is here!

621
01:05:53,683 --> 01:05:56,015
-Aunt Kanta! Run!
-Where do l throw it?

622
01:05:56,218 --> 01:05:57,617
Here!

623
01:06:00,222 --> 01:06:03,487
-Wow! Good throw, my lioness!
- Naturally!

624
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:15,502
You're cheating!

625
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:17,502
He's not out. l am the umpire.

626
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,973
Mummy! Move a little there.
...That's right.

627
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:23,543
Watchman! Move behind... Further!

628
01:06:23,713 --> 01:06:25,044
- Here?
- That's fine!

629
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:28,047
A little more.
Yes... That's fine.

630
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:31,343
Come, son!
lt's only cricket!

631
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:37,591
lt's my turn to bat!

632
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,593
Hadn't l told you he'd
grow up to be like Kapil Dev!

633
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:56,939
-Aunt, take the catch!
- Go take your run!

634
01:06:57,246 --> 01:06:58,645
Ourfielding isn't tight.

635
01:06:58,814 --> 01:07:01,009
lt's a tough game!

636
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:06,052
Mr. Umpire, keep this here.

637
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:12,752
Come on!

638
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:20,066
Didn't l tell you he'd
become a Gavaskar someday!

639
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:22,569
With bowlers like me, he will
surely become a Gavaskar!

640
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:28,608
- Come, Rahul. You bowl too.
- No.

641
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:30,302
No problem. Play underarm.

642
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:33,113
Give it a try, Rahul.

643
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:45,859
- He's going to bowl fast!
-You're sacred!

644
01:07:46,762 --> 01:07:48,457
Come on, my lion!

645
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:54,668
Come on!

646
01:08:02,678 --> 01:08:05,579
Well, Mr. Lion Suri!!

647
01:08:06,682 --> 01:08:08,582
Saw how amazing my...

648
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:21,127
These crockery and cutlery...

649
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:26,633
...have been bought from
Harrod's store in London.

650
01:08:27,736 --> 01:08:30,637
And these idiots levy
a duty of 1 50% on it.

651
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:34,071
l could nevertolerate
cheap spoons in college...

652
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:37,109
...so l can't possibly
tolerate them now!

653
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:39,179
You have a mania
for imported items.

654
01:08:39,348 --> 01:08:41,248
You should have got
an imported wife, too!

655
01:08:41,817 --> 01:08:43,216
Take some.

656
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:48,517
Wife? ...Well, you don't get
wives at the Harrod's store.

657
01:08:48,824 --> 01:08:50,724
Or else, l would
have surely got one.

658
01:08:50,893 --> 01:08:53,726
But once in New York...

659
01:08:53,896 --> 01:08:57,332
Tell your wife.
Don't hide things from Kanta.

660
01:08:57,633 --> 01:08:59,726
No. There's nothing to hide.

661
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:05,636
Trixie came into my life
before Kanta did.

662
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,609
Trixie? Who's she?

663
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:10,210
Trixie means full of tricks.

664
01:09:10,746 --> 01:09:14,079
Kanta, don't take him seriously.
He loves to tease you.

665
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:16,184
There is nothing to tease about.

666
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:20,914
lf l have ever met anyone else
after marrying you, then...

667
01:09:21,123 --> 01:09:23,148
...have l evertold you about it?

668
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:25,259
lf there is another woman,
then remarry!

669
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:29,696
He is joking, Kanta. Would he
ever leave you to remarry?!

670
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:36,203
One can form relationships,
even without getting married.

671
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:39,740
- lndu, what are you saying?
- The truth.

672
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:43,743
lndu, you may say
whateveryou like about me.

673
01:09:43,913 --> 01:09:46,746
But there is no need to
speak about DK this way.

674
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:48,747
There was a need,
so l spoke.

675
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:49,747
Meaning?

676
01:09:51,887 --> 01:09:54,287
You can ask him that!

677
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:57,290
Hey! What's wrong
with her? ...lndu!

678
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:03,988
What's the matter?

679
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:08,802
l've been observing this tension
between you since morning.

680
01:10:09,905 --> 01:10:13,807
And the way lndu was
talking to that boy Rahul...

681
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:16,841
Who is Rahul?

682
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:23,384
- He is my son.
-What!

683
01:10:30,993 --> 01:10:33,553
When l went
to Nainital in 1 973...

684
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:41,735
- No, l won't have.
-You're grown up now!

685
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:43,929
-You're going to be a father!
- Get lost!

686
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:47,275
Well... but you aren't
even married as yet!

687
01:10:50,379 --> 01:10:54,975
ln the midst of the din, she too
was there... lonely and quiet.

688
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:59,820
Her name was Bhavna.
l knew herfrom my school days.

689
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:03,186
She used to be so lively.
But now...

690
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:06,693
This girl has been
through a big tragedy.

691
01:11:06,862 --> 01:11:10,320
She lost herfamily in a car
accident while still in school.

692
01:11:10,799 --> 01:11:15,202
The master said that Bhavna had
completely withdrawn since then.

693
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:19,135
The master knew Bhavna and
herfamily since a long time...

694
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:22,242
...so, in a way,
her responsibility fell on him.

695
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:27,214
He wanted Bhavna to
somehow overcome her grief.

696
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:29,249
Orthat someone explain to her.

697
01:11:29,885 --> 01:11:31,546
DK, show me your hand.

698
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:41,795
This is your marriage line.

699
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:45,299
How deep and strong it is!

700
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:49,303
lndu and you are
very happy, aren't you?

701
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:50,802
Yes, very much so.

702
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:55,808
Look, how strong
it is all throughout. But...

703
01:11:57,946 --> 01:12:01,177
- But at one point...
-At one point? What?

704
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:06,753
Never mind. Since you don't
believe in it, forget it.

705
01:12:07,856 --> 01:12:10,757
But what did you see?

706
01:12:10,926 --> 01:12:12,757
Nothing. Never mind.

707
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:17,764
Tell me one more thing.

708
01:12:18,867 --> 01:12:20,767
Will we get a
baby boy or a baby girl?

709
01:12:23,906 --> 01:12:27,774
You do have a boy. But l'm
not sure if it will be this time.

710
01:12:27,976 --> 01:12:32,310
l want a son!

711
01:12:32,915 --> 01:12:34,815
Then you'll surely get a son.

712
01:12:37,453 --> 01:12:38,852
Show me your hand.

713
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:41,854
-What will you do looking at it?
-At least show it.

714
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:45,358
Now l'll tell you yourfuture.
...Show me your hand.

715
01:12:50,966 --> 01:12:52,661
Where is your marriage line?

716
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:55,362
- Oh yes! ...The left hand.
- lt's this one.

717
01:12:56,238 --> 01:12:58,365
lt's incomplete.

718
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:02,170
But there is
a faint line all along.

719
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:05,279
Yes. l can't understand.

720
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:09,214
There is a marriage line,
and yet there isn't.

721
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:14,617
Let me see.
Where is your life line?

722
01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:16,322
Here it is.

723
01:13:16,925 --> 01:13:20,326
This one? ...it's rather short.

724
01:13:20,929 --> 01:13:22,624
l know.

725
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:24,262
You do?

726
01:13:24,433 --> 01:13:28,836
l see! That means,
you have decided to die soon!

727
01:13:29,004 --> 01:13:31,837
l haven't decided that.
...l know it.

728
01:13:33,175 --> 01:13:33,834
She knows!

729
01:13:35,477 --> 01:13:39,345
And she is dead.
l can't believe it!

730
01:13:39,982 --> 01:13:42,883
She had a strange blind belief.

731
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:46,351
On meeting Bhavna,
l was surprised to see...

732
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:49,923
...that a person could bottle up
one's grief for so long.

733
01:13:50,526 --> 01:13:52,926
As though sorrows had become
the sole purpose of her life.

734
01:13:56,532 --> 01:13:58,932
l was sympathetic towards Bhavna.

735
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:01,798
And Bhavna needed that.

736
01:14:02,404 --> 01:14:05,339
lt was plain sympathy, which one
can feel towards anybody.

737
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:08,603
Nothing more.

738
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:13,813
Forget all this, Bhavna.
These things are useless.

739
01:14:14,016 --> 01:14:18,885
Fate and destiny are all rubbish!
Lead the life of a normal girl.

740
01:14:19,254 --> 01:14:22,382
Please don't scold me, DK.

741
01:14:23,492 --> 01:14:26,893
Please come and sit next to me.

742
01:14:27,062 --> 01:14:29,895
She asked me to sit next to her,
and l did not refuse.

743
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,900
What happened afterthat...

744
01:14:35,804 --> 01:14:37,704
l can't explain to anyone.

745
01:14:47,549 --> 01:14:48,948
lndu and my children...

746
01:14:53,088 --> 01:14:54,988
...mean the world to me.

747
01:14:56,592 --> 01:15:01,359
My... My home is
breaking apart, Suri.

748
01:15:02,965 --> 01:15:05,661
What do l do?

749
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:08,869
How do l explain to lndu?

750
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:14,066
My home is breaking apart.

751
01:15:16,812 --> 01:15:18,871
You will have to do one thing.

752
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:25,385
You will have to
send that boy away.

753
01:15:25,554 --> 01:15:26,953
l know that.

754
01:15:29,057 --> 01:15:31,457
But where will l send him?

755
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:33,960
To a boarding school.

756
01:15:38,267 --> 01:15:39,962
He too has a right.

757
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:46,969
Where will he go?
How is he at fault?

758
01:15:49,111 --> 01:15:51,511
What has that
innocent child done?

759
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:56,209
Mummy, l can't solve
these sums. Please help me.

760
01:15:57,653 --> 01:16:00,918
Winky, don't disturb me.
l can't solve your sums.

761
01:16:02,524 --> 01:16:04,424
What's the matter with
you these days, mummy?

762
01:16:04,593 --> 01:16:08,723
Suppose that fatso stands first
in class again, then?

763
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:14,326
- May l help you?
- Do you know to solve them?

764
01:16:14,536 --> 01:16:15,935
Yes, l do.

765
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:21,474
Show me.

766
01:16:34,623 --> 01:16:37,456
Mini, what are you doing!
...How do you know this, Rahul?

767
01:16:37,626 --> 01:16:41,619
l always stood first in Math.
But l was a bit weak in Hindi.

768
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:43,529
Won't you study further?

769
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:47,234
Stay back in Delhi.
Study here.

770
01:16:48,136 --> 01:16:51,037
- Shall l stay here?
-Yes! Stay here.

771
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:54,074
l'll have to ask aunty.

772
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:57,577
Why ask mummy?
She loves all children.

773
01:16:57,746 --> 01:17:00,237
Yes! Mummy loves children!

774
01:17:00,549 --> 01:17:01,948
Me, too?

775
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:05,210
Yes! She is a little shy
of you. You're still new.

776
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:09,990
Gupta was saying that a lot
remains to be done on the design.

777
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:11,989
Yes, sir. That's right.

778
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:15,493
We have a presentation at
Mr. Bansal's office within a week.

779
01:17:15,664 --> 01:17:17,996
He has already called twice.
What's the matter with you?

780
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:26,630
lt's a personal problem.

781
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:35,514
l'll take this home.
l'll try to finish it there.

782
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:28,568
For how long will you
continue to have sleeping pills?

783
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:34,107
Till l don't get sleep!

784
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:55,957
''Respected Master,
l am absolutely fine here.''

785
01:18:56,264 --> 01:18:58,664
''ls there been
any letterfrom my father?''

786
01:18:59,267 --> 01:19:03,033
lt should be Has there been
any letter' and not ls there'.

787
01:19:03,205 --> 01:19:04,103
Okay?

788
01:19:05,173 --> 01:19:09,041
''Any news about him?
Uncle loves me a lot.''

789
01:19:09,244 --> 01:19:14,580
''There is an aunty too. Even she
loves me but is a little shy.''

790
01:19:15,183 --> 01:19:16,582
''Are you all right?''

791
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:20,120
- Brother Rahul, who's drawn this?
- l have.

792
01:19:20,288 --> 01:19:23,121
- But who are they?
- This is your papa...

793
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:26,556
...your mother,
your sister and you.

794
01:19:26,728 --> 01:19:28,127
Where is mummy's bun?

795
01:19:28,296 --> 01:19:31,129
lt's behind. You can't see it.

796
01:19:31,299 --> 01:19:34,632
That's right. You can't see it.
But where are you?

797
01:19:35,237 --> 01:19:36,636
l'm sitting right here.

798
01:19:36,805 --> 01:19:38,636
-Where are you in this picture?
- l'm not here.

799
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:41,172
- Shall l draw myself here?
- Please do.

800
01:19:41,343 --> 01:19:43,607
lt's mummy's birthday
the day aftertomorrow.

801
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:45,679
l forgot to get bangles for her.

802
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:49,182
Brother Rahul, what
will you get for mummy?

803
01:19:49,384 --> 01:19:50,681
l...

804
01:19:53,722 --> 01:19:56,190
Shall l make a
bangle box for aunty?

805
01:20:00,829 --> 01:20:04,230
l've composed a poem.
Shall l recite it?

806
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:05,423
Forget it!

807
01:20:05,834 --> 01:20:07,734
''Awooden log,
On it is a wooden horse''

808
01:20:07,903 --> 01:20:10,235
''A hammerfell- Crash, boom, bang
on the horse's tail!''

809
01:24:18,086 --> 01:24:20,486
-You'll come in, won't you?
- No. l'll come later.

810
01:24:20,655 --> 01:24:21,986
Come on, Brother Rahul.

811
01:24:33,601 --> 01:24:35,000
Let's go in.

812
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:37,001
- Let's go.
- No. - Come on.

813
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:39,038
l'll come later.

814
01:25:18,613 --> 01:25:20,012
Move aside.

815
01:25:23,651 --> 01:25:26,552
- Let me also do something.
- Quiet! Don't harass us!

816
01:25:26,721 --> 01:25:28,120
Let her do it.

817
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:30,553
She won't do a thing. She will
only spoil my handwriting.

818
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:32,990
l'll also write.

819
01:25:33,161 --> 01:25:35,061
Don't write anything.
You don't know anything!

820
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:37,061
What are you doing, children?

821
01:25:37,665 --> 01:25:40,065
Please go away!

822
01:25:40,668 --> 01:25:42,363
Mummy is coming!

823
01:25:44,706 --> 01:25:47,106
- Please come, mummy.
-What's the matter?

824
01:25:47,275 --> 01:25:50,608
Nothing. Please be seated
and have your breakfast.

825
01:25:51,713 --> 01:25:55,581
-What's this?
-Your birthday present.

826
01:25:58,753 --> 01:26:01,517
-What is it?
- Open it and have a look.

827
01:26:05,627 --> 01:26:07,026
lt's lovely!

828
01:26:07,195 --> 01:26:09,322
- Did you get it, Winky?
- No.

829
01:26:09,631 --> 01:26:12,532
l don't think Mini must
have got it. Who bought it?

830
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:15,533
Brother Rahul has personally
made it foryour birthday.

831
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:23,542
Papa, look what
Brother Rahul made for mummy.

832
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:27,546
Papa, look what Rahul
made for mummy... Look, papa.

833
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:36,622
Have you made this?
...lt's lovely!

834
01:26:36,791 --> 01:26:38,622
Didn't aunty like it?

835
01:26:39,727 --> 01:26:42,628
- Of course, she did.
- She liked it very much.

836
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:44,196
Yes! She liked it very much.

837
01:29:09,577 --> 01:29:12,137
-What happened?
- Take your son away!

838
01:29:56,924 --> 01:30:00,325
l am not your mother! Don't you
dare call me mummy again!

839
01:30:13,174 --> 01:30:15,074
Yuck! l don't like brinjal!

840
01:30:15,977 --> 01:30:17,877
Stupid! You don't like anything!

841
01:30:18,045 --> 01:30:20,878
You stupid! ...
You brinjal! You pumpkin!

842
01:30:21,048 --> 01:30:23,881
- Mummy, tell her.
-Winky, have your dinner quietly.

843
01:30:24,285 --> 01:30:26,879
Brother Rahul, please
pass me the cauliflower.

844
01:30:29,357 --> 01:30:33,259
Blood! Papa, Brother Rahul's
hand is bleeding!

845
01:30:34,028 --> 01:30:37,429
Mummy, look!
Brother Rahul's hand is bleeding!

846
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:39,931
What happened?

847
01:30:47,074 --> 01:30:48,473
What's happened?

848
01:30:50,077 --> 01:30:51,772
lndu, how did he hurt himself?

849
01:30:56,617 --> 01:31:00,018
lndu! How did he hurt himself?

850
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:02,848
How should l know?!
He didn't tell me!

851
01:31:03,991 --> 01:31:06,391
A child gets hurt at home,
and you aren't even aware!

852
01:31:06,994 --> 01:31:08,894
Don't scream at me
in front of the children!

853
01:31:09,197 --> 01:31:11,392
Just because
he is not your child?!

854
01:31:11,999 --> 01:31:15,093
Let the one who has sinned
take care of him! Why bother me?!

855
01:31:27,548 --> 01:31:29,948
Aren't you ashamed
of speaking so?!

856
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:32,984
l have not been as shameless
as you! Are you ashamed?!

857
01:31:33,154 --> 01:31:35,054
So what should l do?!

858
01:31:35,289 --> 01:31:37,484
Tell me, what should l do?!

859
01:31:38,092 --> 01:31:39,992
Should l kill myself?!

860
01:31:43,898 --> 01:31:45,991
You want to go on leave?!
What's wrong with you, DK?

861
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:49,000
The other architects have
already sent their proposals!

862
01:31:51,606 --> 01:31:53,597
Sir, if l don't get leave,
l will have to resign.

863
01:31:54,141 --> 01:31:58,009
Resign! Will you will have to
resign! What nonsense you speak!

864
01:31:58,212 --> 01:32:00,112
This is too much!
A height of negligence!

865
01:32:00,281 --> 01:32:02,511
You should have informed me
earlierthat you can't work!

866
01:32:03,050 --> 01:32:04,950
Sir, l'd told you earlier
that l have a personal problem!

867
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:06,711
Even l have a problem!

868
01:32:08,055 --> 01:32:12,958
Look, l have to run the company.
l can't possibly do it alone.

869
01:32:13,127 --> 01:32:14,617
Tell me what the matter is.

870
01:32:23,671 --> 01:32:26,606
All right... You may go!

871
01:32:27,108 --> 01:32:30,475
You know your responsibility.
...You may go.

872
01:32:37,151 --> 01:32:39,483
- Uncle, will you take me boating?
- Sure.

873
01:32:39,654 --> 01:32:42,054
-What about riding?
- l'll take you riding too.

874
01:32:42,223 --> 01:32:44,487
-What about China Peak?
-You want to go there?

875
01:32:44,659 --> 01:32:45,853
-Yes.
-Walking?

876
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:48,560
Yes. That's the master's house.

877
01:33:16,123 --> 01:33:17,522
Mr. Tiwari?

878
01:33:18,125 --> 01:33:20,025
-When did you come?
- This morning. Good you found us.

879
01:33:20,194 --> 01:33:23,459
We were going to come to school
at 2 p.m. for Rahul's admission.

880
01:33:23,631 --> 01:33:26,031
- The Principal told me.
- Son, greet him.

881
01:33:26,634 --> 01:33:29,034
- How are you, son?
- l'm fine. How are you?

882
01:33:29,203 --> 01:33:30,602
Absolutely fine.

883
01:33:30,738 --> 01:33:32,831
Where is the master?

884
01:33:35,176 --> 01:33:37,076
He passed away.

885
01:33:37,244 --> 01:33:40,077
What! ...When?

886
01:33:42,383 --> 01:33:46,080
He suffered a heart attack
a few days ago.

887
01:34:01,102 --> 01:34:05,505
Uncle, do you think my mother
may have lied to me?

888
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:07,471
Why?

889
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:11,009
Maybe, my father isn't alive?

890
01:34:25,393 --> 01:34:27,088
He'll be here soon.

891
01:34:30,197 --> 01:34:33,098
Please understand,
even l have some problems.

892
01:34:40,841 --> 01:34:44,572
Mr. Tiwari, will l
get admission here?

893
01:34:44,745 --> 01:34:47,145
Yes, son. We are trying.

894
01:34:50,284 --> 01:34:53,185
Will l have to stay here then?

895
01:34:54,288 --> 01:34:58,190
Yes. You can stay
in the hostel here.

896
01:35:06,167 --> 01:35:09,068
Where do l get his books?

897
01:35:09,236 --> 01:35:10,635
You'll get the list from office.

898
01:35:11,172 --> 01:35:14,107
- Do l get his uniforms or...
- They will be made here.

899
01:35:15,209 --> 01:35:18,110
Rahul, come here.
...Meet your Principal.

900
01:35:20,214 --> 01:35:22,114
How will you send him?

901
01:35:22,283 --> 01:35:24,717
l will be going to Delhi,
so l'll fetch him.

902
01:35:24,885 --> 01:35:26,113
Mr. Tiwari will bring him here.

903
01:35:28,255 --> 01:35:32,157
So now you're going
to join our school.

904
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:36,161
Thank him, son. He has
agreed to give you admission.

905
01:35:36,330 --> 01:35:37,729
Say thank you.

906
01:35:39,266 --> 01:35:43,669
Can l send you
a cheque forthe fee?

907
01:35:44,271 --> 01:35:48,173
You can sign the papers after
2 days when the office opens.

908
01:35:48,809 --> 01:35:50,208
All right.

909
01:35:52,313 --> 01:35:55,214
Send him after 1 0 days.
And do not be late.

910
01:35:55,382 --> 01:35:59,250
l don't like boys who come late.
...Do you understand?

911
01:36:01,422 --> 01:36:03,617
Let's leave, Rahul.
...Thank you, Brother.

912
01:36:08,729 --> 01:36:12,927
Uncle, the string has gone in.

913
01:36:17,238 --> 01:36:19,138
The string has gone in?

914
01:36:19,673 --> 01:36:22,141
Tie it around from outside.

915
01:36:24,278 --> 01:36:25,176
Come here.

916
01:36:32,319 --> 01:36:33,843
- Sleep the way it is.
- No. lt will fall.

917
01:36:34,321 --> 01:36:36,721
lt won't fall.
Take a blanket to sleep.

918
01:36:38,592 --> 01:36:40,025
Go to sleep.

919
01:36:42,329 --> 01:36:44,229
What's the time?

920
01:36:45,332 --> 01:36:46,731
lt's 8:30. Why?

921
01:36:47,334 --> 01:36:50,667
Mini must be in the bathroom
brushing herteeth...

922
01:36:50,838 --> 01:36:54,035
...and Winky must be
banging loudly at the door.

923
01:36:54,875 --> 01:36:56,274
Hurry up, Mini!

924
01:36:58,379 --> 01:37:00,939
Hurry! ...Hurry up, stupid!

925
01:37:06,287 --> 01:37:07,185
Yuck!

926
01:37:07,354 --> 01:37:08,514
Why is there so much of noise?

927
01:37:08,889 --> 01:37:11,687
Mummy, tell Mini. She occupies
the bathroom for so long.

928
01:37:11,859 --> 01:37:14,191
Dirty girl!
Go wash yourface.

929
01:37:14,361 --> 01:37:18,195
One more thing... Both of you
can sleep with me tonight.

930
01:37:18,365 --> 01:37:20,595
Are you afraid
of being alone, mummy?

931
01:37:41,388 --> 01:37:44,289
Uncle, l like you very much.

932
01:37:44,458 --> 01:37:46,289
- Really?
-Yes.

933
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:50,794
Son, even l like you very much.

934
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:57,302
When my papa comes,
l won't stay with him.

935
01:37:58,639 --> 01:38:01,403
-Why not?
- l will stay with you.

936
01:38:09,316 --> 01:38:12,752
Will l be able to
call you papa then?

937
01:41:35,889 --> 01:41:38,084
l don't want to
stay in this school!

938
01:41:39,693 --> 01:41:42,025
Why not?

939
01:41:42,196 --> 01:41:44,027
l don't like it!

940
01:41:44,198 --> 01:41:48,032
Stay here for a few days
and you will begin to like it.

941
01:41:48,202 --> 01:41:50,102
There are many other children
also who stay here.

942
01:41:50,370 --> 01:41:52,395
- Can't l stay in Delhi?
- No!

943
01:41:52,739 --> 01:41:56,607
You have to stay here for a while
in the hostel. Understand?

944
01:41:56,810 --> 01:41:58,641
Why can't l stay in your house?!

945
01:43:26,733 --> 01:43:28,223
And who is this?

946
01:43:29,736 --> 01:43:31,829
That's me and my papa.

947
01:43:35,275 --> 01:43:38,176
- Does your papa wear spectacles?
-Yes.

948
01:44:21,788 --> 01:44:23,688
Papa and Brother Rahul are back!

949
01:44:24,791 --> 01:44:26,190
Rahul is back?

950
01:44:30,063 --> 01:44:31,963
Mummy! Papa is back!

951
01:44:42,843 --> 01:44:44,310
Papa is back!

952
01:44:46,847 --> 01:44:48,747
Papa, what have you got for me?

953
01:44:51,885 --> 01:44:54,285
- Did you get my badminton racket?
-Yes!

954
01:44:59,893 --> 01:45:01,656
Just a minute. l'll be back.

955
01:45:07,267 --> 01:45:10,100
She was screaming a while ago,
''Brother Rahul is back!''

956
01:45:10,270 --> 01:45:12,170
And now you're not
even talking to him.

957
01:45:12,339 --> 01:45:14,466
No, l wasn't screaming.

958
01:45:14,808 --> 01:45:19,142
She's so shy of you now,
but soon she will be afteryou!

959
01:45:19,313 --> 01:45:20,211
No!

960
01:45:23,317 --> 01:45:24,716
Here it comes on you, Mini!

961
01:45:33,860 --> 01:45:36,954
- Did you get your admission?
-Yes.

962
01:45:39,066 --> 01:45:40,431
- So you'll go away?
-Yes.

963
01:46:05,826 --> 01:46:07,521
What happened?

964
01:46:11,832 --> 01:46:16,735
Major and l have once again...

965
01:46:22,876 --> 01:46:25,276
You've understood what
l am trying to say, right?

966
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:27,278
Yes.

967
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:38,254
But you would always say
that you don't need any support.

968
01:46:38,425 --> 01:46:40,825
That you don't need a family.

969
01:46:40,994 --> 01:46:43,394
And that you are
an independent woman.

970
01:46:47,534 --> 01:46:49,832
lt would be fine
if l were just a woman.

971
01:46:50,937 --> 01:46:52,837
But l'm a mothertoo.

972
01:46:54,374 --> 01:46:56,842
When my child
held my hand and said...

973
01:46:57,043 --> 01:46:59,375
''Please come home, mummy''

974
01:46:59,546 --> 01:47:01,241
...l couldn't hold myself back.

975
01:47:02,349 --> 01:47:04,249
ljust couldn't
hold myself back, lndu.

976
01:47:10,490 --> 01:47:12,287
Shall l say something, lndu?

977
01:47:12,893 --> 01:47:16,795
Awoman has no say when the
motherly feelings in her arise.

978
01:47:27,941 --> 01:47:29,272
-You tell her!
-You tell!

979
01:47:29,443 --> 01:47:31,843
-What happened?
- Sister has stood first in class.

980
01:47:32,045 --> 01:47:33,410
She defeated that fatso!

981
01:47:33,580 --> 01:47:36,276
Very good! Well-done!

982
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:39,886
lf Brother Rahul had not taught
her, it would've been impossible.

983
01:47:40,053 --> 01:47:42,385
-Who's Rahul?
- Brother Rahul!

984
01:47:42,989 --> 01:47:45,389
The boy whom l
spoke to you about.

985
01:47:47,194 --> 01:47:49,389
lt's good that the kids have
mingled with each other so well.

986
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:06,243
lt's not in this either.
They are my personal papers!

987
01:48:06,413 --> 01:48:08,813
They are Rahul's Nainital papers.
Where are they?

988
01:48:08,982 --> 01:48:11,815
l had told you to keep them
in a personal file!

989
01:48:12,452 --> 01:48:14,352
l have to send them
with Rahul to Nainital.

990
01:48:14,521 --> 01:48:16,853
Look in that drawer.
...the lower one.

991
01:48:22,963 --> 01:48:25,363
Sir, are these the papers?

992
01:48:27,167 --> 01:48:30,659
Yes. Where were they? Can't you
even file them properly?!

993
01:48:31,972 --> 01:48:34,907
- Rahul, take care of these.
-All right, uncle.

994
01:48:35,075 --> 01:48:36,906
They are your papers.
Take them home.

995
01:48:37,077 --> 01:48:39,477
-Are you being naughty?
- No.

996
01:48:39,646 --> 01:48:40,908
Sit in my cabin.

997
01:48:42,015 --> 01:48:43,915
l'll go meet Mr. Dhawan.

998
01:49:04,938 --> 01:49:06,098
Son.

999
01:49:06,973 --> 01:49:10,306
This letter must have fallen
from those papers. Keep it there.

1000
01:49:10,477 --> 01:49:12,377
-Whose letter is it?
- To Mr. Malhotra...

1001
01:49:14,981 --> 01:49:16,676
Give it to me.

1002
01:49:38,038 --> 01:49:39,437
l see.

1003
01:49:40,073 --> 01:49:43,770
You wanted a proposal from the
best architect. lt had to be good.

1004
01:49:44,077 --> 01:49:45,977
l think we'll clinch the deal.

1005
01:49:46,146 --> 01:49:48,979
Yes... All right,
l'll call you tomorrow.

1006
01:49:49,583 --> 01:49:51,983
Fine... after 2-3 days.
Bye, Mr. Bansal. Thank you.

1007
01:49:53,119 --> 01:49:56,520
DK, l think Mr. Bansal has
liked your proposal very much.

1008
01:50:05,732 --> 01:50:06,630
Come on.

1009
01:50:10,136 --> 01:50:11,535
Come on!

1010
01:50:12,138 --> 01:50:14,231
Don't forget the papers.

1011
01:50:31,224 --> 01:50:33,124
Wish him, Rahul.

1012
01:50:33,493 --> 01:50:34,926
Wish him.

1013
01:50:36,429 --> 01:50:39,125
-Whose son is he?
- My friend's.

1014
01:50:40,233 --> 01:50:42,633
He's a very cute child.
Where does he study?

1015
01:50:43,436 --> 01:50:46,132
He'll be going to a
boarding school in Nainital.

1016
01:52:12,258 --> 01:52:14,158
Rahul is not at home!

1017
01:52:14,761 --> 01:52:17,594
-What!
- l searched everywhere.

1018
01:52:17,764 --> 01:52:19,163
And the front door was open.

1019
01:52:50,363 --> 01:52:52,763
Stay with the children.
l'll take a look outside.

1020
01:52:56,870 --> 01:52:59,771
What happened, mummy?
Where is Rahul?

1021
01:53:00,340 --> 01:53:01,170
lt's nothing.

1022
01:53:01,341 --> 01:53:02,740
Why was papa shouting his name?

1023
01:53:32,939 --> 01:53:35,237
-Watchman, did any child pass by?
- No.

1024
01:53:35,441 --> 01:53:37,272
- Light skinned with blue eyes?
- No, sir.

1025
01:53:57,931 --> 01:54:00,991
He's nowhere to be seen. Call
the police, l'll take the car.

1026
01:54:03,303 --> 01:54:07,000
Wait, lndu...
Don't call the police.

1027
01:54:07,540 --> 01:54:09,701
Give the phone here.

1028
01:54:30,396 --> 01:54:32,296
- Please call Mr. Suri.
- He's sleeping.

1029
01:54:32,465 --> 01:54:34,296

1030
01:54:34,467 --> 01:54:36,298
-Who's calling?

1031
01:54:36,469 --> 01:54:39,097
- Call Mr. Suri. lt's urgent.

1033
01:54:44,444 --> 01:54:47,345
Ask Suri to stay ready.
l'll pick him up.

1034
01:55:23,416 --> 01:55:24,815
There he is!

1035
01:55:37,463 --> 01:55:39,863
Rahul, where are you running?

1036
01:55:40,466 --> 01:55:41,865
Wait, Rahul!

1037
01:55:49,509 --> 01:55:50,976
Suri, it's not him.

1038
01:55:54,514 --> 01:55:57,881
Where the hell is he?!
Where could he have disappeared?!

1039
01:55:58,551 --> 01:56:00,280
-Where do l look for him?!
- Come on, now!

1040
01:56:00,486 --> 01:56:04,752
What's the use of looking for
him here? lt wasn't that boy.

1041
01:56:04,924 --> 01:56:07,324
-What do l do?
- Let's go to the police station.

1042
01:56:07,927 --> 01:56:11,328
So how are you?
How is everything else?

1043
01:56:13,433 --> 01:56:16,834
l'd called you the other day
but you didn't come.

1044
01:56:19,472 --> 01:56:23,340
Well, l don't get the time... Bye.

1045
01:56:28,982 --> 01:56:30,574
Could you please hurry?

1046
01:56:37,023 --> 01:56:38,422
Father's name?

1047
01:56:39,525 --> 01:56:40,924
Father's name!

1048
01:56:41,527 --> 01:56:44,428
What will you do
with the father's name?

1049
01:56:44,597 --> 01:56:47,430
You have the child's name
and his entire description.

1050
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:49,693
On finding him, will you
ask him his father's name?!

1051
01:56:49,869 --> 01:56:51,427
Father's name?

1052
01:56:55,775 --> 01:56:56,673
Louder.

1053
01:56:56,843 --> 01:56:59,937
DK Malhotra! Can't you hear?!

1054
01:57:01,447 --> 01:57:02,846
Calm down.

1055
01:57:04,450 --> 01:57:09,387
DK, any news? Did you find him?
Where are you calling from?

1056
01:57:09,689 --> 01:57:12,886
l'm calling from a petrol pump
nearthe police station.

1057
01:57:13,493 --> 01:57:17,395
We have filed a report at the
police station. But of no avail.

1058
01:57:17,997 --> 01:57:22,195
There's no news of him.
l wonder what's happened to him.

1059
01:57:29,042 --> 01:57:31,875
Come home.

1060
01:57:32,045 --> 01:57:34,445
lt's no use sitting there.

1061
01:57:40,586 --> 01:57:41,985
What is she saying?

1062
01:57:43,089 --> 01:57:46,991
Excuse me!
Any news of the boy?

1063
01:57:47,593 --> 01:57:49,493
None, yet.

1064
01:57:49,662 --> 01:57:53,496
Of what use is such a big unit?!
Can't you find even a child?!

1065
01:57:53,666 --> 01:57:55,566
What are you here for?!

1066
01:57:59,639 --> 01:58:00,401
Come on!

1067
01:58:17,757 --> 01:58:20,225
We found this boy.
ls he yours?

1068
01:58:22,762 --> 01:58:25,458
We found this letter
in his pocket.

1069
01:58:25,631 --> 01:58:29,465
He refused to say where he lives.
This letter had your address.

1070
01:58:30,069 --> 01:58:31,969
Please sign here.

1071
01:58:38,611 --> 01:58:40,078
Where did you go?

1072
01:58:45,284 --> 01:58:47,309
l asked, where did you go?!

1073
01:58:54,660 --> 01:58:57,561
l am asking you something!
Where did you go?!

1074
01:59:01,134 --> 01:59:04,433
Aren't you ashamed?! You are
a guest at somebody's house!

1075
01:59:04,604 --> 01:59:06,504
We're doing so much foryou!

1076
01:59:06,672 --> 01:59:09,436
lnstead of being grateful,
this is what you do!

1077
01:59:10,843 --> 01:59:13,971
Now, what's the use of standing
in front of me like a statue?!

1078
01:59:14,147 --> 01:59:17,048
You don't even have
the courtesy to apologise!

1079
01:59:17,583 --> 01:59:21,519
l am glad you're leaving!
We'll be rid of you!

1080
01:59:22,622 --> 01:59:25,022
There has been no peace in the
house ever since you've come!

1081
01:59:25,191 --> 01:59:27,523
Do you know how worried
Mini and Winky have been foryou?

1082
01:59:27,693 --> 01:59:29,524
Mini hasn't stopped crying!

1083
01:59:29,695 --> 01:59:32,027
And l've been in and around
the house looking foryou!

1084
01:59:32,632 --> 01:59:36,534
What would we have done
if you were harmed in any way?!

1085
01:59:38,638 --> 01:59:42,540
Does one walk out
at midnight in this city!

1086
01:59:42,742 --> 01:59:45,006
They kidnap small children!

1087
01:59:45,178 --> 01:59:48,011
The entire police force of the city
is in search of you!

1088
01:59:48,181 --> 01:59:51,082
lf something were to happen
to you, yourfather and l...

1089
01:59:52,919 --> 01:59:54,819
l mean, your uncle and l...

1090
01:59:56,222 --> 01:59:58,622
- l know.
-What do you know?

1091
01:59:59,725 --> 02:00:03,627
That he's my papa.
lt is written in the letter.

1092
02:00:47,106 --> 02:00:48,733
DK, wait.

1093
02:00:49,141 --> 02:00:50,733
Just a minute.

1094
02:01:00,786 --> 02:01:03,687
- He knows.
-What?

1095
02:01:07,293 --> 02:01:09,693
About your relationship with him.

1096
02:01:11,797 --> 02:01:12,695
How?

1097
02:01:15,801 --> 02:01:17,496
He had this with him.

1098
02:01:21,474 --> 02:01:23,203
Go to him.

1099
02:02:18,864 --> 02:02:19,762
Listen.

1100
02:02:23,869 --> 02:02:26,963
Son, you shouldn't do this.
Where did you go?

1101
02:02:31,177 --> 02:02:35,580
Uncle Suri and l
looked foryou everywhere.

1102
02:02:48,961 --> 02:02:50,656
Are you angry with me?

1103
02:03:00,406 --> 02:03:01,771
What happened?

1104
02:03:03,876 --> 02:03:05,275
Nothing.

1105
02:03:08,881 --> 02:03:10,280
What does he say?

1106
02:03:14,920 --> 02:03:16,820
He isn't saying a word.

1107
02:03:24,930 --> 02:03:26,830
l can understand.

1108
02:03:31,437 --> 02:03:35,840
lmagine a child who is trying to
trace his father since years...

1109
02:03:36,041 --> 02:03:39,374
...and when he finally
does find him...

1110
02:03:39,545 --> 02:03:41,877
...his father
does not accept him.

1111
02:03:42,982 --> 02:03:46,918
He keeps him apart
and sends him far away.

1112
02:03:49,021 --> 02:03:54,926
You can imagine what that
child must be going through.

1113
02:03:57,029 --> 02:03:58,929
Sorry about saying all this.

1114
02:04:01,901 --> 02:04:03,300
Let's go to sleep.

1115
02:04:04,904 --> 02:04:08,806
Carry on. l'll come later.

1116
02:04:26,492 --> 02:04:30,394
Drop the children to school
by taxi in the morning.

1117
02:04:31,997 --> 02:04:34,090
l'll take Rahul to the station.

1118
02:07:04,049 --> 02:07:05,448
Come on, Mini.

1119
02:07:06,085 --> 02:07:08,986
Come, Mini.
We are getting late.

1120
02:07:51,697 --> 02:07:54,530
Mummy, why had Rahul run away?

1121
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:56,099
l don't know.

1122
02:07:58,203 --> 02:08:01,468
Won't he ever return now?

1123
02:08:02,107 --> 02:08:03,506
l don't know.

1124
02:08:04,109 --> 02:08:06,805
-Whom will he stay with?
-With his papa.

1125
02:08:08,614 --> 02:08:10,514
But he doesn't have a papa.

1126
02:08:11,116 --> 02:08:15,052
He does. He had drawn his papa's
picture and showed it to me.

1127
02:08:18,757 --> 02:08:21,055
Hey, this is Rahul's sketch book.

1128
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:23,487
Yes. He gave it to me.

1129
02:08:23,662 --> 02:08:29,066
This is mummy, me, you,
papa and Brother Rahul.

1130
02:08:29,234 --> 02:08:32,863
This is Brother Rahul
and his papa.

1131
02:08:45,250 --> 02:08:48,151
Did you strike off
Rahul's picture?

1132
02:08:48,320 --> 02:08:49,912
No.

1133
02:09:41,273 --> 02:09:44,174
-Where is sir?
- He's taken Rahul to the station.

1134
02:09:53,318 --> 02:09:54,717
Mr. Tiwari! Here.

1135
02:09:56,321 --> 02:09:58,221
- How are you?
- Let's go, Rahul.

1136

The train is about to leave.

- l'll carry it.
- No, allow me.

1138
02:10:03,328 --> 02:10:05,023
- How are you, Rahul?
- This way, Mr. Tiwari.

1139
02:10:08,333 --> 02:10:11,234
The seat numbers are 55 and 56.

1140
02:10:31,423 --> 02:10:33,823
Come on, Rahul.
The train is about to leave.

1141
02:11:13,899 --> 02:11:17,300
Will you come to meet me?

1142

Yes, son. l will surely come.
Wheneveryou say so.

1143

You won't

1144
02:11:28,513 --> 02:11:32,347
No, son. l will neverforget you.
...Not this time.

1145
02:11:33,485 --> 02:11:35,385
You won't forget me, will you?

1146
02:11:36,488 --> 02:11:40,891
How can l forget you?
After all, you are my papa.

1147
02:11:41,493 --> 02:11:45,896
Yes... Yes, son. l'm your papa.

1148

Come on, Rahul, hurry up.
The train is about to leave.

02:12:19,965 --> 02:12:22,160
Write to me once you get there.

1151
02:12:22,968 --> 02:12:25,368
- Mr. Tiwari...

1152
02:12:25,971 --> 02:12:27,370

-What about the food?
- l'll arrange it in the train.

1154
02:12:31,576 --> 02:12:33,476
Don't let him

1155
02:12:33,645 --> 02:12:35,840
- Have you kept his water bottle?
- lt must be with him.

1156
02:12:36,014 --> 02:12:38,209
- Son, where is your bottle?
- lt's in the car.
