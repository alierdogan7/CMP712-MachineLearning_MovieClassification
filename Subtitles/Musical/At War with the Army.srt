1
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,330
War. Total war. A struggle for
survival.

2
00:01:37,425 --> 00:01:39,225
In this era of force and
destruction....

3
00:01:39,712 --> 00:01:42,912
...historians will argue. What was
the most influential factor.

4
00:01:44,261 --> 00:01:47,261
What was the most deadly
instrument? The most deadly weapon?

5
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:52,571
Was it the overwhelming manpower?
Was it the blistering fire of the rockets?

6
00:01:58,453 --> 00:02:01,853
Was it the thundering mail from
heaven? The bombs, the blockbusters?

7
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:12,834
Was it the lightening descention of
the parachute?

8
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:18,878
Was it the whithering stutter of the
light machine-gun?

9
00:02:20,454 --> 00:02:24,254
Or the spectacle from the
commanding troops?

10
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:30,961
Or the pattended tanks?

11
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,200
Was it the flame-thrower?

12
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:38,601
Or was it the screaming anger of faster
than sound, quicker than this: the B-2 rocket?

13
00:02:40,648 --> 00:02:44,448
No! It was none of these things.
The most effective, the most deadly....

14
00:02:43,905 --> 00:02:46,705
The most terrifying weapon of all
time was.

15
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:50,102
Yes, you're right. The sergeant's
whistle.

16
00:02:52,136 --> 00:02:54,136
All right you guys, now I'm gonna
tell you something.

17
00:02:56,137 --> 00:03:00,137
The adjutant is coming, see? And
as usual the Colonel ain't very happy.

18
00:03:02,186 --> 00:03:08,586
And I ain't very happy either. Look
at this joint. It looks like Coney
Island on a Monday morning.

19
00:03:08,723 --> 00:03:10,523
- Hi Serg, what's the action?
- Have you seen Corwin?

20
00:03:11,247 --> 00:03:13,847
Yeah, I seen him, but I couldn't take
him so I sent him over to the mess
hall. He's on KP.

21
00:03:15,408 --> 00:03:16,608
- Okay, take them away.
- Right Serg.

22
00:03:18,492 --> 00:03:25,292
All right my friends. I want you to fall
out, spread out, and pick up everything
that ain't growing or nailed down.

23
00:03:56,253 --> 00:03:58,553
Let's go. Give us some food.
Come on, come on!

24
00:03:59,116 --> 00:04:00,616
Come on, let's have it.

25
00:04:00,748 --> 00:04:03,148
- What are they gripping about?
- Well, they've got to eat them.

26
00:04:03,483 --> 00:04:05,083
Well, I've got to cook them.

27
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:05,379
Let's get out of here, it the
Sergeant.

28
00:07:15,776 --> 00:07:18,076
- What do you think you're cooking
around here? - Beans?

29
00:07:18,151 --> 00:07:21,551
Oh shut up! You've been getting
away with murder, and it's got to
stop. Understand? Shut up!

30
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,216
Just because we were friends
before and used to work together,
I've been covering up for you.

31
00:07:26,869 --> 00:07:28,869
That's gotta stop too. Do you
understand? Shut up!

32
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:33,931
Now get your pack and everything
that goes with it. I want to see you
down front in 5 minutes. Understand?

33
00:07:35,186 --> 00:07:36,186
Shut up!

34
00:07:36,675 --> 00:07:39,475
You're going to go on a long, long
journey and you may not be back
this way. Understand?

35
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,880
Shut up!

36
00:07:46,381 --> 00:07:49,781
Get to packing, everything goes
with it, be down there in 5 minutes.
SHUT UP!

37
00:07:50,619 --> 00:07:52,219
Going on a long, long trip, might not
be there when you're finished.
SHUT UP!

38
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,900
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

39
00:07:57,171 --> 00:07:59,771
It'll go under AR 605/300..

40
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,190
before the CO can get it un 104 and
107.

41
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,890
Now the record goes on WVA 20
and 24.

42
00:08:08,051 --> 00:08:10,451
He could be eligible for a 615/360.

43
00:08:11,305 --> 00:08:12,705
Section 7, paragraph 49.

44
00:08:12,794 --> 00:08:13,994
Oh sure, I get it.

45
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:26,330
Sure and an MR19-2 and the profile
is 24.4.4.4D.

46
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:30,158
Oh boy, I ain't in the army, I'm back
in the numbers racket.

47
00:08:31,096 --> 00:08:32,296
Here's the mail Corporal.

48
00:08:32,885 --> 00:08:35,685
Well, guess I'll take another crack at
that bandit. Do you think it will work?

49
00:08:36,718 --> 00:08:38,518
Should. There was a guy in here a
while ago who fixed it.

50
00:08:39,316 --> 00:08:40,316
Bout time.

51
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:50,509
How do you like that? Now you
don't even get the nickel back.

52
00:08:52,285 --> 00:08:56,285
Crazy army. I asked for a transfer
again and they throw me right out of
Italian headquarters.

53
00:08:58,301 --> 00:09:00,901
Shawnessy, how many times do I
have to tell you that this ain't a day
room.

54
00:09:02,795 --> 00:09:04,795
- Got a cigarette?
- Yeah, here.

55
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:06,701
- Tell Sergeant McWell I want to see
him right away. - Right!

56
00:09:07,803 --> 00:09:09,403
- Is Miller in?
- Yeah.

57
00:09:13,358 --> 00:09:14,758
Hey Miller, what do you think we've
got here, midgets?

58
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,310
Captain, what about this training
film here tomorrow morning?

59
00:09:24,265 --> 00:09:26,665
Oh yes.....that begins at 7 o'clock.

60
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:30,859
The theater is 2 blocks away so I
think we'd better fall out at 6:35.

61
00:09:31,429 --> 00:09:32,629
They'll want us in front of ltalian
headquarters.

62
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:35,167
Not later than 6:25.

63
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:38,066
In that case Davenport, have the
men lined up and ready to go

64
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:38,830
at...6:15.

65
00:09:42,005 --> 00:09:43,605
Serg, that guy is lost again.

66
00:09:44,115 --> 00:09:46,315
Well, you'd better find him.
- Right Serg.

67
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:53,933
Hey, you see them lights? You see
that sign?

68
00:09:54,388 --> 00:09:55,988
Let's be turning them off.

69
00:09:56,776 --> 00:09:59,176
Sergeant McWeel, we've got to see
the work, don't we?

70
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:03,258
Well, what if Colonel Davis comes?
He don't like lights on in the daytime.

71
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:07,372
Another thing McWell, the company
has an early formation tomorrow and

72
00:10:08,116 --> 00:10:10,716
you'd better have those men fall out
at 5 minutes before 6.

73
00:10:12,053 --> 00:10:13,853
- 5 minutes before 6 huh?
- Yeah.

74
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:17,248
I tell you, I've got some names here
that are cock-a-may-mes.

75
00:10:19,527 --> 00:10:23,727
...Rodowsky. ..Smellywesh...
Keselioshmiasch.

76
00:10:24,214 --> 00:10:27,214
Why don't we pull them out early,
say 5:45 huh?

77
00:10:27,414 --> 00:10:29,014
- Okay.
- Right Serg.

78
00:10:32,737 --> 00:10:34,737
Some day this guy is going to blow
his brains out.

79
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:36,961
If you ask me, he's already done it.

80
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,400
Yes sir. Yes Captain.

81
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:13,901
Yes sir!

82
00:11:45,231 --> 00:11:46,831
See the first Sergeant in the other
room.

83
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:58,601
Go around the outside. Through
that door.

84
00:12:04,378 --> 00:12:05,378
That door.

85
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,850
I said that door.

86
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:06,626
Got a cigarette? No, I quit.
- Can't afford it.

87
00:13:13,124 --> 00:13:14,324
There you are. Where've you
been?

88
00:13:15,304 --> 00:13:20,104
Fine looking specimen you are.
Get over there. Look at you! Look at this!

89
00:13:21,356 --> 00:13:25,956
Fix the helmet. Now get out on
the parade grounds. Ten times
round. Double time. Understand?

90
00:13:26,855 --> 00:13:28,855
Then come back here. I've got
plans for you.

91
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,760
Go on, get the lead out of your
bucket.

92
00:13:34,354 --> 00:13:36,154
Wait a minute. Come here.

93
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,450
Got a cigarette?

94
00:13:55,311 --> 00:13:57,111
- I've been arguing with him again.
- Oh yeah?

95
00:13:58,566 --> 00:14:01,166
I don't dig this army at all. I want
overseas....

96
00:14:02,004 --> 00:14:05,004
....I stay here. The guys that want
to stay here, get overseas.

97
00:14:05,604 --> 00:14:08,204
- You forget, there's a war on.
- Yeah, but what do we get to do about it?

98
00:14:09,084 --> 00:14:12,884
When I was a civilan, we had
something going every minute.
Singing, dancing, working in nightclubs.

99
00:14:13,543 --> 00:14:15,143
I join the army, I sit on my hands.

100
00:14:16,832 --> 00:14:19,632
I'm hungry. Think I'll inspect the
mess hall.

101
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:26,119
- Hi ya Serg. Been waiting up for me?
- How come you're late Edwards?

102
00:14:26,896 --> 00:14:29,796
I was drunk. I don't blame you.
With a kisser like that, I'd be loaded
all the time.

103
00:14:31,195 --> 00:14:35,195
- Thank-you. - You're welcome, now
go to your barracks Edwards, get into
your  fatigues and report back here.

104
00:14:36,056 --> 00:14:39,256
And if you have any social
engagements, call your secretary
and have her cancel them.

105
00:14:45,038 --> 00:14:46,538
Sergeant's real brave today.

106
00:14:47,657 --> 00:14:49,057
I get any mail?

107
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,670
Sure took you a long time to sober up.

108
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:55,726
took me a long time to get drunk.

109
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,300
My new girl had a date with another
Joe last night.

110
00:14:59,104 --> 00:15:00,704
What's the matter, losing your
appeal?

111
00:15:03,555 --> 00:15:05,355
Does that look like I'm losing my appeal?

112
00:15:06,228 --> 00:15:07,628
Wow! Very tasty.

113
00:15:19,194 --> 00:15:19,994
Hello.

114
00:15:20,718 --> 00:15:21,118
Hello.

115
00:15:21,413 --> 00:15:23,813
-Is Sergeant Puccinelli in?
- No, he's out.

116
00:15:25,316 --> 00:15:27,116
What did you want to see him
about?

117
00:15:27,214 --> 00:15:29,414
It's of a rather personal nature.

118
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:34,719
- Would you like to leave a
message.
- Yes, just tell him Nelly was here.

119
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:37,151
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

120
00:15:38,894 --> 00:15:42,494
On second thought, do you mind if I
sit here and wait for a while.

121
00:15:43,556 --> 00:15:45,756
- Oh no, go right ahead.
- Thanks.

122
00:15:49,768 --> 00:15:51,368
Clark, do you have that field....

123
00:15:52,405 --> 00:15:53,405
manual?

124
00:16:13,704 --> 00:16:15,904
I want four copies of this Clark, it is
to go to the ad agent.

125
00:16:17,655 --> 00:16:19,855
- But sir, I did this yesterday.
- Oh you did?

126
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:20,746
Yes sir.

127
00:16:22,895 --> 00:16:25,695
So you did. Well, I want one more
copy.

128
00:16:26,374 --> 00:16:27,174
Yes, sir.

129
00:16:28,443 --> 00:16:33,243
You know, it takes a fantastic amound
of paperwork to administer even a little
tank company, such as we have here.

130
00:16:33,813 --> 00:16:35,213
Are you ready Ernie?

131
00:16:36,075 --> 00:16:38,275
Not yet dear. I'll be right with you.

132
00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:41,181
I've decided we can do without
another copy of this.

133
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:48,738
- That's our commanding officer.
- Which one?

134
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,994
Who in the company is that girl
married to?

135
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,641
I don't know dear . Shall we call the
detectives?

136
00:16:57,493 --> 00:16:58,893
Now darling, don't get testy.

137
00:16:59,788 --> 00:17:04,088
just happen to know that she's the
tidiess little girl, she works on the
post, she had calcium deficiency, and...

138
00:17:04,966 --> 00:17:06,666
...she's expecting.

139
00:17:06,754 --> 00:17:09,654
- Expecting?
- Yes, and don't ask me what she's expecting.

140
00:17:09,926 --> 00:17:12,526
Where in the world did you uncover
all of this, Mrs. Shelock Holmes?

141
00:17:13,457 --> 00:17:14,657
At the clinic yesterday.

142
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,933
I was there for my cold shot and
one of the nurses told me about her.

143
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,404
Say, I just remembered, there's
been a mix-up in the OD roster.

144
00:17:23,174 --> 00:17:25,374
- I know.
- I may get it.

145
00:17:26,489 --> 00:17:29,689
No you won't. Lt. Tourrey is stuck
as officer of the day.

146
00:17:29,922 --> 00:17:31,722
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

147
00:17:31,869 --> 00:17:35,569
Sally Pearson told me, that the
adjutant's wife told her, that the
adjutant said so at noon.

148
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,750
Oh well, if Sally said so, that settles it.

149
00:17:46,296 --> 00:17:47,896
How are you getting along with
Colonel Davis?

150
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:50,939
Well, that depends. How are you
getting along with Mrs. Davis?

151
00:17:52,301 --> 00:17:54,501
That woman! She's so rank-
conscience.

152
00:17:56,377 --> 00:17:57,577
How soon will you be ready to leave?

153
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:01,235
Why don't you go to the club and
wait. I have a lot of papers to sign.

154
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:05,082
-Can't someone else sign those?
- I'm the only one.

155
00:18:05,937 --> 00:18:08,137
The United States Army has high
regard for my signature.

156
00:18:09,035 --> 00:18:11,435
I wish The First National Bank did.

157
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:21,675
Where'd you get these clothes
Sergeant?

158
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:27,535
- Quarter master sir.
- Why didn't you get a shipping
ticket when you got the clothes?

159
00:18:30,029 --> 00:18:34,029
I don't know sir. Maybe they
weren't paying attention when I
drew the issue?

160
00:18:37,111 --> 00:18:38,511
Then this is stolen goods.

161
00:18:40,362 --> 00:18:41,162
No sir.

162
00:18:41,355 --> 00:18:43,655
I think I'll have to have a look at
army regulations.

163
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,240
But Lt. Davenport, don't you trust me?

164
00:18:46,121 --> 00:18:48,321
This is no way to run a business.
Carry on.

165
00:19:01,749 --> 00:19:03,149
He's going to tell me how to run a
business.

166
00:19:03,695 --> 00:19:06,095
He used to be a soda-jerk. He just
ran out of soda.

167
00:19:06,399 --> 00:19:09,799
- I got to see the First Sergeant.
- Hi ya kid. I see you're still wearing
your old hat.

168
00:19:10,822 --> 00:19:12,222
You leave me alone. I got troubles.

169
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:13,852
In the army? You got troubles?

170
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,800
Yeah, and I gotta see the First
Sergeant right away! It's important.

171
00:19:17,498 --> 00:19:18,298
Take it easy...

172
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,300
Don't tell me how to take it. I got to
get a three-day pass.

173
00:19:20,634 --> 00:19:23,634
Last guy in the army that got a
three-day pass, was Sergeant York.

174
00:19:24,934 --> 00:19:26,734
Yeah, well I don't care. I got to see
my wife. It's an emergency.

175
00:19:27,631 --> 00:19:30,031
I've had emergencies, but could I
get a pass?

176
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:31,702
Bet you were never having a baby.

177
00:19:32,508 --> 00:19:35,108
Kid, I've never even
had my appendics out.

178
00:19:36,165 --> 00:19:38,165
- Corwin!
-Yes sir.

179
00:19:39,629 --> 00:19:41,629
- Did you do those penalty tours?
-Yes Corporal.

180
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,250
- Did you report to the drill
Sergeant? - Yes Corporal.

181
00:19:43,412 --> 00:19:44,612
- Did you report to the mess
Sergeant? - Yes Corporal.

182
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:45,750
Okay.

183
00:19:46,475 --> 00:19:50,221
Boy, if I ever get overseas, the first
thing I'm gonna do is surrender.

184
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,330
Concentration camps have got to
be better than this.

185
00:19:54,613 --> 00:19:57,813
What crumby coffee. Why I
wouldn't wash my......

186
00:19:57,557 --> 00:19:58,357
Hey! It's here, the shipping order.

187
00:19:59,397 --> 00:20:01,197
-Came while you were out.
-Now watch me get out of this hole.

188
00:20:01,906 --> 00:20:03,306
- Hey Serg, I wanna....
- What do you want?

189
00:20:03,904 --> 00:20:06,904
- Nothing. I just thought that maybe I....
- Get out of my way. Can't you see
I'm busy?

190
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:12,019
Captain Caldwell, I've just seen the
shipping orders and I have just the
man for you sir.

191
00:20:12,598 --> 00:20:13,598
Good. Who is he?

192
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:15,019
Me! First Sergeant Victor
Puccinelli.

193
00:20:16,054 --> 00:20:16,854
Don't be foolish Sergeant.

194
00:20:17,811 --> 00:20:21,611
This call is only for Privates and
PFC's. You'd better make up your
mind, you're staying here.

195
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,280
- I've seen.....
-  I won't argue that point.

196
00:20:25,377 --> 00:20:29,177
Now, about this shipment. We can't
be expected to cripple ourselves, so.....

197
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:31,495
....don't send anyone who is useful.

198
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:34,097
How about that kid that never
doesn anything right?

199
00:20:34,498 --> 00:20:36,098
- You mean Corwin?
- That's the one.

200
00:20:36,771 --> 00:20:37,771
He's right out here now sir.

201
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,620
Maybe Eisenhower can do
something with him.

202
00:20:42,189 --> 00:20:42,989
Yes sir.

203
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,077
Corwin!

204
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:49,438
- I want to see you.
- I've been wanting to see you too Vic.

205
00:20:49,663 --> 00:20:50,263
I wanted to know if....

206
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,060
Get you hands off my desk and call
me Sergeant.

207
00:20:53,124 --> 00:20:55,224
- Can't you stand up?
- Yes Sergeant.

208
00:20:56,197 --> 00:20:58,397
I just wanted to know if I could get a
three-day pass.

209
00:20:59,836 --> 00:21:00,736
What'd you say?

210
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:03,349
I want to know if I can get a three-
day pass?

211
00:21:03,543 --> 00:21:05,543
Did you get permission from your
platoon Sergeant to come in here?

212
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,390
No, Sergeant, but I....

213
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:09,691
How many times must I tell you that
in the army you must go through channels.

214
00:21:10,288 --> 00:21:14,588
Yeah, but this is an emergency and if I go
through the section leader and the platoon
sergeant and you and everbody else, ...

215
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,050
...my kid will be old enough to be
drafted himself.

216
00:21:19,175 --> 00:21:20,175
Very funny.

217
00:21:20,816 --> 00:21:23,016
I can't be giving you a three-day
pass every week.

218
00:21:23,376 --> 00:21:24,176
You just came off one.

219
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:26,655
That's not true. I haven't been on
one in a long time.

220
00:21:27,026 --> 00:21:29,426
And if my wife forgets what I look
like, you'll be responsible.

221
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,650
You should get that lucky. We'll see
about it when the time comes.

222
00:21:34,021 --> 00:21:35,621
- You heard me.
- Yes Sergeant.

223
00:21:36,092 --> 00:21:38,292
- Aren't we going to rehearse our
act for the show? - Oh get going.

224
00:21:40,504 --> 00:21:41,904
Wait a minute. Come here.

225
00:21:43,395 --> 00:21:44,795
How come you didn't shave today?

226
00:21:45,428 --> 00:21:48,428
I didn't know I was suppose to. I didn't
shave yesterday and nobody said nothing.

227
00:21:48,704 --> 00:21:49,904
Get out of here.

228
00:21:53,057 --> 00:21:54,657
You didn't always used to treat me
like this.

229
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:55,613
Oh stop mumbling.

230
00:21:56,218 --> 00:21:58,618
you didn't always used to treat me
like this, that's what I said, so there so.

231
00:21:59,489 --> 00:22:01,489
- Are you going to start that again?
-Yes, I am.

232
00:22:01,568 --> 00:22:04,768
You're suppose to be my friend.
We lived on the same block, in the
same city.

233
00:22:05,528 --> 00:22:06,528
And you know what you promised
my mother.

234
00:22:07,362 --> 00:22:09,362
Stop hitting my desk. And what did
I promise your mother?

235
00:22:09,908 --> 00:22:11,108
That no one would harm a hair on
my head.

236
00:22:11,718 --> 00:22:12,518
You mean both heads.

237
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:13,298
Ho, ho! That's rich!

238
00:22:14,532 --> 00:22:16,532
Oh quiet pea-head. Just cause we
were friends before...

239
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:18,541
Friends before is right.

240
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,405
Anything to do with now .

241
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,010
I have a responsibility and you're
part of it.

242
00:22:22,563 --> 00:22:23,963
I'm warning you, you're driving me
crazy.

243
00:22:24,351 --> 00:22:25,751
That's no drive, that's a short putt.

244
00:22:27,409 --> 00:22:29,009
Ah what do you want? Special
privileges?

245
00:22:28,993 --> 00:22:31,993
No, I just want to remember you as the best
man at my wedding. You're not kidding.

246
00:22:32,891 --> 00:22:35,691
We were buddies, and we wrote
songs, and we dansed and we sang together.

247
00:22:36,578 --> 00:22:38,778
And you still owe me 8 dollars and
75 cents, since before the war.

248
00:22:39,377 --> 00:22:41,377
And we was friends and family. We
was just like brother and sister.

249
00:22:42,156 --> 00:22:45,956
And what happens? Along comes a
crumby little war and clip-clap, you
turn into a Dr. Jerkyll and Mr. Clyde.

250
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:47,819
What is it with you anyhow?

251
00:22:48,072 --> 00:22:51,072
- Okay. ..okay. ..
- Okay. ..okay. ..Big man!

252
00:22:52,507 --> 00:22:54,907
Couple of stinking stripes. Big deal!

253
00:22:55,182 --> 00:22:58,182
- Go home and wash your face.
- Go home and wash your face.

254
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:02,009
Big deal. Look at him, General
Delivery.

255
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:04,119
Get out of here.

256
00:23:06,824 --> 00:23:08,424
What's the matter with Einstein?

257
00:23:08,227 --> 00:23:09,027
He thinks I bombed Pearl Harbour.

258
00:23:10,234 --> 00:23:13,034
When Edwards comes back, tell
him he's being shipped out.

259
00:23:13,178 --> 00:23:14,978
- Say, there was a Nelly here
looking for you. - Millie?

260
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:18,499
Wonder what she wants? Oh,
what's the date?

261
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:22,150
- The 29th.
- That's it! Tomorrow is the
anniversary of our first alert.

262
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,370
Alert? This office has never been
alerted.

263
00:23:24,918 --> 00:23:26,518
I know it. I just used it as a gag.

264
00:23:27,576 --> 00:23:29,576
You know the first time I saw Nelly,
she looked real good to me.

265
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:31,619
-But all I got was ice-cubes.
- So?

266
00:23:32,302 --> 00:23:34,502
-So I told her we were being
alerted. - So?

267
00:23:35,627 --> 00:23:37,027
So she let me kiss her.

268
00:23:37,256 --> 00:23:37,856
So?

269
00:23:38,423 --> 00:23:40,623
- So, I took her out a few more
times. - So?

270
00:23:40,988 --> 00:23:43,188
- So, she let me kiss her a few more
times. - What's wrong with that?

271
00:23:44,463 --> 00:23:47,863
Nothing, expect one day she
started to talk and I found out how
dumb she was.

272
00:23:48,688 --> 00:23:50,888
You know that dame is really 60
cents short.

273
00:23:51,671 --> 00:23:53,671
Not only that. She got on a getting-
married kick.

274
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:56,499
What is it with these dames? They
all want to get married?

275
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:58,479
I know a lot of nice people that
aren't married.

276
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,470
Then one night I took her out....

277
00:24:04,185 --> 00:24:08,185
Yes sir! Yes sir! Right sir!

278
00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:12,092
After you tell Edwards he's being
shipped out, send him into Miller..

279
00:24:12,613 --> 00:24:13,613
...to have his supply record checked
out. Right.

280
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,599
Hello! You're that cute Corporal that
was here when I came before, aren't you?

281
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,420
Yes, but the Sergeant still isn't in.

282
00:24:40,292 --> 00:24:44,292
I don't suppose you know if he's going
to stay in camp tonight or tomorrow night?

283
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:49,035
- No you see, we never know when
we're going to be alerted. - I know.

284
00:24:49,658 --> 00:24:52,058
Ours is not the reason why. Ours is
to do or die.

285
00:24:53,344 --> 00:24:54,544
That's cute.

286
00:24:55,056 --> 00:24:57,056
Look, why don't you write him a
note.

287
00:24:58,338 --> 00:25:01,338
Write him? Well, you do it.

288
00:25:02,447 --> 00:25:06,247
Just say: I'll be back at 6:45 when I
get off from work.

289
00:25:07,728 --> 00:25:09,328
And put down it's important.

290
00:25:10,871 --> 00:25:13,671
And if I don't see him, there might
be trouble.

291
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:19,433
Okay. If I see him. You know, he's
not the easiest guy in the world to locate.

292
00:25:20,803 --> 00:25:21,803
Don't I know it.

293
00:25:22,716 --> 00:25:27,116
Well, I have to get back to the PX.
We're terribly busy today, we're closed.

294
00:25:29,947 --> 00:25:31,547
Closed for inventory.

295
00:25:32,618 --> 00:25:33,818
Good-bye.

296
00:25:37,394 --> 00:25:38,794
Well, they did it again.

297
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,990
The adjutant just stuck me with
Officer of the Day.

298
00:25:41,381 --> 00:25:42,781
- I know.
- You know?

299
00:25:43,822 --> 00:25:46,222
- Well, why didn't you tell me?
- My wife just told me.

300
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:49,490
Did she also mention when the war
would be over?

301
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:52,067
She doesn't tell me everything she
knows.

302
00:25:58,669 --> 00:26:00,869
- Clark?
- It's okay. She's gone.

303
00:26:02,262 --> 00:26:03,262
What Millie have to say?

304
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:05,796
She left you a note. She said she'd
be back 6:45.

305
00:26:07,456 --> 00:26:08,456
Come in.

306
00:26:08,941 --> 00:26:09,741
No.

307
00:26:10,155 --> 00:26:12,355
- But Sergeant!
- Have you got permission to come in here?

308
00:26:13,675 --> 00:26:15,275
- No.
- Well get out.

309
00:26:16,311 --> 00:26:19,111
They think all I have to do around
here is hand out passes. Now,
what was I talking about?

310
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:22,311
Nelly. She said if she doesn't see
you tonight, there's going to be trouble.

311
00:26:23,097 --> 00:26:24,297
I'd better catch the first bus into town.

312
00:26:25,595 --> 00:26:29,395
- Hey Corporal. Would you know where I can...
- Hey! Douse them lights. The Colonel's coming.

313
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:33,909
The offices too.

314
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:41,510
Hey! Oh, I'm sorry sir, but the
Colonel is coming and you know
how he feels about lights burning in the daytime.

315
00:26:42,341 --> 00:26:44,341
- And you know how I feel about it.
- Yes, I do sir.

316
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,712
- All clear.
- Okay, turn them on.

317
00:26:57,318 --> 00:26:58,118
Hey, where's Corwin?

318
00:26:58,126 --> 00:27:01,926
He's been running in and out of
here all day long, and if it keeps up,
we're going to have to put in a revolving door.

319
00:27:02,694 --> 00:27:03,894
Does he got permission to skip training?

320
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,064
No and you'd better find him and
we'll send him to the CO.

321
00:27:06,846 --> 00:27:07,446
Right Serg!

322
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,150
And another thing. Edwards and
these guys are shipping overseas.

323
00:27:11,508 --> 00:27:12,308
Come in.

324
00:27:12,379 --> 00:27:13,379
Come in.

325
00:27:14,126 --> 00:27:17,126
- Get out of here.
- Come back.

326
00:27:19,427 --> 00:27:22,527
You need to be explaining why you
haven't been in no classes this afternoon.

327
00:27:22,547 --> 00:27:24,747
- I've been looking all over for you Mc Vie.
- Oh, you've been looking for me huh?

328
00:27:25,364 --> 00:27:27,164
Yeah, can I have permission to see
the first Sergeant?

329
00:27:27,403 --> 00:27:28,003
No!

330
00:27:28,404 --> 00:27:30,604
- But I gotta see him.
- You don't gotta see nobody!

331
00:27:31,344 --> 00:27:33,744
I've got a message for the first
Sergeant from battalion headquarters.

332
00:27:34,243 --> 00:27:35,643
- Why didn't you say so?
- He didn't let me.

333
00:27:36,213 --> 00:27:37,413
Corwin, will you never learn?

334
00:27:37,778 --> 00:27:41,378
You know, before you take off on
detail, you gotta tell your platoon Sergeant.

335
00:27:45,587 --> 00:27:46,787
All right! What's the message?

336
00:27:49,478 --> 00:27:52,678
It says you gotta report to the dispensory
in the morning for a physical examination.

337
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:54,539
Physical!?! Let me see that.

338
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:56,775
My application went through.

339
00:27:57,256 --> 00:27:58,256
Serg, you need me for anything?

340
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,200
No, take two weeks off.

341
00:28:02,966 --> 00:28:06,166
Wait a minute Serg. Form 38 is
filled out in case of discharge.

342
00:28:06,861 --> 00:28:08,661
- Discharge? What does that mean?
- Oh he's right Sergeant.

343
00:28:09,527 --> 00:28:15,927
According to paragraph 8, article
40-100, 24 hours prior to discharge
of an enlisted man,

344
00:28:16,173 --> 00:28:21,573
for reasons other than disability, he
must be examined and form 38 filled out.

345
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:23,775
They can't do this to me.

346
00:28:24,524 --> 00:28:25,724
- Sergeant!
- What?

347
00:28:25,817 --> 00:28:27,317
When you get home, will you call
my mother?

348
00:28:27,608 --> 00:28:28,608
Get out of here.

349
00:28:29,286 --> 00:28:32,286
I'll refuse. I'll go in and tap his head
with a 4x4.

350
00:28:33,358 --> 00:28:37,358
Captain Corwin, can you tell me
about this? They want to discharge me.

351
00:28:38,923 --> 00:28:40,923
- Now Serg.
- Go ahead and read it for yourself.

352
00:28:43,366 --> 00:28:45,766
Sergeant Goosenelly. Nelly will be......

353
00:28:45,966 --> 00:28:46,966
No, no, no

354
00:28:54,417 --> 00:28:56,617
WDA...Form 30...

355
00:28:58,342 --> 00:29:02,142
Oh calm yourself Sergeant. Your applicatioin
for warrant-officer has come through.

356
00:29:03,355 --> 00:29:06,155
You're being discharged to accept
the appointment as warrant-officer.

357
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:08,099
Me an officer? Well, that's worse.

358
00:29:09,154 --> 00:29:10,954
- Sergeant.
- Yes sir?

359
00:29:11,612 --> 00:29:13,812
Will you make out tomorrow's
morning report and send it to battalion.

360
00:29:14,613 --> 00:29:15,613
Morning report tonight?

361
00:29:16,681 --> 00:29:18,681
Yes, from now on, they want it in
the night before.

362
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,845
- It's a discharge, so I can become a
warrant-officer. - Congratulations!

363
00:29:29,024 --> 00:29:30,024
Hey what's this deal about me
shipping out?

364
00:29:30,705 --> 00:29:33,105
It's no deal. You're just on a movement.
You'll be leaving in a couple of days.

365
00:29:33,711 --> 00:29:35,911
Look Serg. How about crossing my
name off that list?

366
00:29:37,245 --> 00:29:39,045
You know, I've got a new girl in town
and we're pretty serious.

367
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,580
- That's very touching.
- Listen, I've got to see my girl.

368
00:29:42,043 --> 00:29:44,043
I've seen the girls you go with.
You'll do better where you are going.

369
00:29:44,814 --> 00:29:46,414
Yeah? Well, I've seen your type too.

370
00:29:47,164 --> 00:29:48,764
Well, why don't you drop down to
Realdo theater sometime?

371
00:29:49,722 --> 00:29:51,322
- Renaldo?
- Yeah, the new red-headed usher.

372
00:29:51,395 --> 00:29:52,995
- Helen?
- Yeah, that's right.

373
00:29:53,045 --> 00:29:54,245
Well I'm a dirty, low-down, no-
good....

374
00:29:55,025 --> 00:29:56,625
You win that argument. Go ahead,
start another one.

375
00:29:57,418 --> 00:29:58,818
You're cutting in on me. I go with
Helen.

376
00:29:59,348 --> 00:30:01,948
-You went with Helen.
- Now I see why I'm on shipment.

377
00:30:02,677 --> 00:30:03,877
You're pulling your rank on me.

378
00:30:04,298 --> 00:30:07,098
Don't do it Serg. 96 article of war .
Sock him and the Captain will bust you.

379
00:30:09,173 --> 00:30:10,973
Put this on the bulletin board.

380
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,320
Sgt. Puccinilli, Millie will be here at
6:45. There may be a problem.

381
00:30:20,506 --> 00:30:23,506
You can take off wise guy and start
packing. I've got work to do.

382
00:30:24,981 --> 00:30:26,381
- This ain't no poolroom.
- No?

383
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,940
- I could have sworn I just saw an eightball.
- Get out of here.

384
00:31:02,347 --> 00:31:04,547
- And what do you think you're doing?
- I'm singing.

385
00:31:04,726 --> 00:31:05,926
You call that singing?

386
00:31:06,512 --> 00:31:08,712
- Didn't you like it a little?
- I didn't even like it a lot.

387
00:31:09,716 --> 00:31:11,116
You have to admit, my voice is
different.

388
00:31:11,792 --> 00:31:13,192
Come on Serg, let's hear you sing it.

389
00:31:13,661 --> 00:31:15,861
I can't. I've got some work to do
and besides, I've got a date in town.

390
00:31:16,933 --> 00:31:19,133
Come on Sergeant!

391
00:31:19,186 --> 00:31:20,186
Okay. One chord.

392
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,670
All right boys. Let's get going.
Come on.

393
00:33:35,293 --> 00:33:37,293
- How long before Miller gets here?
- About 20 minutes.

394
00:33:37,742 --> 00:33:40,742
I'd like to find the joker that spread
the rumor around that I'm already a
warrant-officer.

395
00:33:41,592 --> 00:33:42,192
Why?

396
00:33:42,193 --> 00:33:45,093
Every time I walk into the barracks
some nitwick shout Attention!

397
00:33:56,005 --> 00:33:59,005
Okay you lucky people. You can
get ready and go to town now . I'm
ready to take over.

398
00:33:59,565 --> 00:34:01,165
Take that junk into the Captain's
office.

399
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,800
And take that with you!

400
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,800
Hey Corwin, give me a hand will
you?

401
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Well I guess that wraps things up
Clark. Go on, get home to the little woman.

402
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,600
Thanks Serg! See you in the
morning.

403
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,200
I'll be back in a minute. Hey Corwin.
Don't forget you have to polish up outside too.

404
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:25,000
Hey Shawnessay. Some dame
might drop in here asking for me, so
tell her I'm out running the obstacle course.

405
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,000
Okay.

406
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,900
You know Shawnessay, I kind of
wish Mc Vie would cut this throat.

407
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,800
How could he blow his whistle?

408
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,900
You know, some people say when
you get in the army, you get used to it.

409
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
But they don't say how long it takes,
and I ain't getting any younger.

410
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,200
- You know something Corwin?
- Hey Corporal!

411
00:34:53,693 --> 00:34:55,293
I guess I'll get me a couple of
beers...

412
00:34:55,562 --> 00:34:57,362
- So, going to wet your whistle eh?
- You bet.

413
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,400
Come on, let's be hurrying.

414
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:09,723
Hey, there's something you missed.

415
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,301
Let's be getting on the ball.

416
00:35:16,312 --> 00:35:17,512
Yeah, but nobody can see up there
Sergeant.

417
00:35:17,931 --> 00:35:19,131
That don't make no difference!

418
00:35:20,781 --> 00:35:22,581
It's awful sloppy around here.

419
00:35:25,451 --> 00:35:26,251
You gotta be neat.

420
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,780
You gotta be tidy.

421
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,480
Cause if we ain't, somebody's
gonna get it.

422
00:35:34,798 --> 00:35:37,398
This army ain't just a place to have
fun you know.

423
00:35:39,058 --> 00:35:42,058
Well, if anybody asks for me, I'm
painting the town.

424
00:35:43,739 --> 00:35:47,339
And when I'm painting the town..

425
00:35:49,895 --> 00:35:51,295
..I'm painting the town.

426
00:35:52,577 --> 00:35:53,777
Big man.

427
00:35:58,191 --> 00:35:59,591
Gotta be neat.

428
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,184
Gotta be tidy.

429
00:36:08,452 --> 00:36:10,252
Here's something you missed.

430
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:13,933
Let's be getting on the ball.

431
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:16,951
Yeah, but Sergeant, nobody can
see tthat.

432
00:36:17,066 --> 00:36:18,666
That don't make no difference!

433
00:36:22,605 --> 00:36:26,405
If anybody asks for me, I'll be out
painting the town.

434
00:36:30,387 --> 00:36:31,987
And when I paint the town...

435
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:35,866
...I'm painting the town.

436
00:36:36,173 --> 00:36:37,173
Take it easy son.

437
00:36:37,742 --> 00:36:40,542
Why does that Mc Vie have to be in
the army? Why couldn't he be in the navy?

438
00:36:41,525 --> 00:36:43,325
I can't sleep in the afternoon on
account of that guy.

439
00:36:43,408 --> 00:36:44,808
Why don't you take a poke at him?

440
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:47,001
Me take a poke at Sergeant Mc Vie?

441
00:36:47,262 --> 00:36:47,662
You know what they'd do to me?

442
00:36:47,742 --> 00:36:50,942
What can they do to you? There's
nothing lower than what you are now.

443
00:36:51,067 --> 00:36:53,467
Look, in the regualtions, it says that
you can challenge anybody in the army.

444
00:36:54,363 --> 00:36:56,963
If you think they're taking advantage of
you, ask them to put the gloves on with you.

445
00:36:58,244 --> 00:37:00,244
You mean I could sock Sergeant
Mc Vie in the nose and nobody
would say nothing?

446
00:37:00,921 --> 00:37:02,121
Suuuure.

447
00:37:02,985 --> 00:37:04,585
- What if he hit me first?
- But you don't let him.

448
00:37:05,601 --> 00:37:07,601
You see it's a matter of science lad.
Come here, I'll show you.

449
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,920
Strike a pose.

450
00:37:13,713 --> 00:37:15,313
See first you gotta take a style.

451
00:37:16,717 --> 00:37:17,917
John L. Sullivan.

452
00:37:19,732 --> 00:37:20,732
No, that's not for you.

453
00:37:21,994 --> 00:37:23,394
Wait a minute. The Jack Dempsey
crouch.

454
00:37:25,552 --> 00:37:27,352
That's better. You're a killer!

455
00:37:27,955 --> 00:37:30,555
Get low! Lower , lower.

456
00:37:36,158 --> 00:37:37,558
Hey I got it. Come here.

457
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,723
Toni Cassaneri. That's it.

458
00:37:42,508 --> 00:37:43,908
He was a ballet dancer.

459
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:04,790
Oh no. Look, you gotta have
rhythm. Watch.

460
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,680
Corwin. Come here.

461
00:38:32,127 --> 00:38:33,527
- What are you doing?
- I'm training.

462
00:38:34,148 --> 00:38:34,748
For what?

463
00:38:34,788 --> 00:38:36,788
- I'm going to put the gloves on with
Sergeant Mc Vie. - Mc Vie?

464
00:38:38,054 --> 00:38:39,054
Yeah, I'm going to jab his head off.

465
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:40,059
Where do you want the body sent?

466
00:38:41,122 --> 00:38:43,522
- Send it to Mc Vie's parents.
-Your body!

467
00:38:44,009 --> 00:38:45,609
Go on, get in and finish the rest of
your work.

468
00:38:51,935 --> 00:38:53,335
- Vic.
- No!

469
00:38:54,702 --> 00:38:55,902
Can't I just talk to you for a minute?

470
00:38:56,505 --> 00:38:57,305
All right. What do you want now?

471
00:38:57,884 --> 00:39:00,084
- Remember that song we wrote together?
- Yeah, what about it?

472
00:39:00,668 --> 00:39:02,368
Well, we got a telegram fromt he
music publisher and he...

473
00:39:03,031 --> 00:39:05,031
..wants us to put the song on a
record and send it to him right away.

474
00:39:05,501 --> 00:39:06,701
Go ahead and make a record of it.

475
00:39:07,227 --> 00:39:08,027
No, I want you should record it.

476
00:39:08,522 --> 00:39:09,722
Get Bing Crosby.

477
00:39:11,126 --> 00:39:11,926
I like you better.

478
00:39:12,521 --> 00:39:14,721
Oh you don't have to fight Mc Vie.
You're punchy already.

479
00:39:15,527 --> 00:39:16,927
Why? Just cause I like you better?

480
00:39:18,104 --> 00:39:20,104
At least you could do, is show a
little consideration for me.

481
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,720
Sure, I know you're a sergeant and
I'm only a private.

482
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:25,608
At least you could do, is be a little
friendly.

483
00:39:26,025 --> 00:39:28,025
All right. I love you, I'm your friend.
What do you want me to do?

484
00:39:28,459 --> 00:39:31,859
If you never ever give me a pass
again, I don't care. Just take this
song into town tonight.

485
00:39:32,463 --> 00:39:34,063
You know that place where you put
a quarter in the machine...

486
00:39:34,793 --> 00:39:36,993
...instead of writing home to your
mother, you send your voice on a record.

487
00:39:43,566 --> 00:39:45,566
- Here's a quarter.
- But I got a date.

488
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,670
So what? Take your date to the
recording booth with you.

489
00:39:48,896 --> 00:39:51,296
Might be a little warm, might be a
little fun.

490
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:53,039
All right. I'll record it.

491
00:39:54,188 --> 00:39:55,588
Millie!

492
00:39:57,511 --> 00:39:58,511
I'll be seeing you.

493
00:40:01,202 --> 00:40:02,002
Come in.

494
00:40:04,434 --> 00:40:05,234
Oh hello.

495
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:08,304
Hello. Is Sergeant Puccinelli in?

496
00:40:08,895 --> 00:40:12,695
- Oh no, he out on a bizzwhack.
- Oh that's a shame. How'd it happen?

497
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:16,221
Say, haven't I seen you someplace
before?

498
00:40:17,445 --> 00:40:22,445
You might have seen me at the PX.
Number 10. I used to sell beer.

499
00:40:23,036 --> 00:40:25,236
But I asked to be transfered to the
candy counter.

500
00:40:26,143 --> 00:40:27,343
What happened? Did you get
hungry?

501
00:40:27,586 --> 00:40:29,186
- Good-evening Corporal.
- Oh hi.

502
00:40:29,768 --> 00:40:30,768
Aren't you going to introduce us?

503
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:34,670
Private Edwards meet a friend.
Friend, meet Private Edwards.

504
00:40:35,216 --> 00:40:36,016
Your name's Millie, isn't it?

505
00:40:36,547 --> 00:40:38,347
Millie doesn't look it, but she just
switched from beer to candy.

506
00:40:39,329 --> 00:40:41,129
Would you like to take your break
now Corporal?

507
00:40:42,057 --> 00:40:43,057
Definetly.

508
00:40:44,034 --> 00:40:44,834
Glad to have met you.

509
00:40:45,425 --> 00:40:47,625
Oh thank-you. If you want
anything, just ring for the bellboy.

510
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,680
He's nice, isn't he?

511
00:40:51,734 --> 00:40:56,334
- Do you think Cutie will be here tonight?
- Cutie? Do you mean Puccinelli?`

512
00:40:57,782 --> 00:40:59,782
No, I don't think he can make it.

513
00:41:00,204 --> 00:41:03,004
But anything you want to tell him,
why you can tell me.

514
00:41:05,762 --> 00:41:09,762
What's your name? The charge of
quarters was so crazy when he
introduced us...

515
00:41:10,703 --> 00:41:13,703
..is all that I remember is that you're
a friend of his.

516
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:18,519
U.S. That's cute. Monogrammed
blankets.

517
00:41:22,712 --> 00:41:25,312
My name is Caldwell. Private Ernie
Caldwell.

518
00:41:25,987 --> 00:41:28,587
I was just thinking that if you're not
doing anything tomorrow night..

519
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:29,820
Oh tomorrow night.

520
00:41:31,613 --> 00:41:32,213
Hello.

521
00:41:33,731 --> 00:41:35,731
Don't you know enough to knock
before you come into a room?

522
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:39,710
Gee whis. I was just down at the
PX and I thought that Corporal
Shawnessay would like some ice- cream.

523
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,806
Set it on the desk. I'll see that he
gets it.

524
00:41:48,782 --> 00:41:49,982
The spoon's inside.

525
00:42:00,986 --> 00:42:02,386
We'll keep this between the two of us.

526
00:42:03,575 --> 00:42:05,175
You don't got to worry about me.
I'm no snitcher.

527
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,560
Got a cigarette?

528
00:42:38,061 --> 00:42:39,861
Corporal I've got to get into town
right away. Can I get a pass?

529
00:42:40,459 --> 00:42:41,259
Are you nuts? You're restricted.

530
00:42:41,395 --> 00:42:43,595
But the fellas forgot the music. I've
got to have a pass.

531
00:42:43,779 --> 00:42:44,579
Nothing doing.

532
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:45,940
Corporal it's a matter of life and
death.

533
00:42:46,218 --> 00:42:47,418
Nothing doing.

534
00:44:32,968 --> 00:44:35,768
Can you sing Melancholy Baby?

535
00:44:36,384 --> 00:44:38,784
- No!
- That's okay, I'm glad.

536
00:44:39,504 --> 00:44:41,704
I hate that Melancholy Baby.

537
00:45:04,272 --> 00:45:05,872
I beg your pardon, did you see..

538
00:45:07,084 --> 00:45:09,484
I beg your pardon. Oh never mind.

539
00:45:13,484 --> 00:45:17,484
Hey Charlie. What was that?

540
00:45:18,104 --> 00:45:19,304
I don't know Serg.

541
00:45:20,512 --> 00:45:21,512
Excuse me..

542
00:45:23,229 --> 00:45:24,829
I beg your pardon.

543
00:45:26,671 --> 00:45:28,071
Did you see what I saw?

544
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,686
Here's a light.

545
00:45:49,672 --> 00:45:50,872
What'll you have?

546
00:45:51,047 --> 00:45:52,847
Creme d'cassise.

547
00:45:53,901 --> 00:45:56,101
Creme d'cassise?

548
00:46:25,548 --> 00:46:27,948
Excuse me little lady. How about a
little drink? Please!

549
00:46:31,233 --> 00:46:34,233
-Hey, can you sing Melancholy Baby?
- Bartender!

550
00:46:34,941 --> 00:46:36,141
All right Romeo.

551
00:46:36,737 --> 00:46:39,937
I'm just buying a little drink for
Melancholy Baby.

552
00:46:40,899 --> 00:46:42,099
You've had enough Serg.

553
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:47,838
I ain't going to stop drinking, until
she starts looking good to me.

554
00:46:57,219 --> 00:47:01,019
You're the first dame I ever met..

555
00:47:01,195 --> 00:47:04,195
..who didn't remind of any other
dame I ever met.

556
00:47:06,325 --> 00:47:07,325
Bartender, How much
do I owe you?

557
00:47:08,208 --> 00:47:09,408
A half a buck.

558
00:47:15,889 --> 00:47:17,889
- Thank-you.
- Thank-you! You've been very nice.

559
00:47:17,902 --> 00:47:21,302
-What were you saying?
- How about singing a little song?

560
00:47:23,031 --> 00:47:25,231
A little song for soldier? Would you
like ah...

561
00:47:25,687 --> 00:47:27,687
good-night song? Or a...

562
00:47:28,998 --> 00:47:31,798
...children's song? Or a

563
00:47:33,301 --> 00:47:35,501
..foolish song?

564
00:47:38,092 --> 00:47:39,292
Oh I'm awfully sorry.

565
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:45,528
- Will you play this please?
- Oh sure.

566
00:49:52,883 --> 00:49:55,683
-It's me Alvin.
- Alvin? What on earth are you
doing in that outfit? Are you nuts?

567
00:49:56,982 --> 00:49:59,582
- Me nuts?
- You guys ran off and forgot the music.

568
00:49:59,622 --> 00:50:00,222
What if you get caught?

569
00:50:00,614 --> 00:50:03,814
Never mind. Get Puc in that
recording booth. We got to have
those records the first thing in the morning.

570
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:05,366
He's over there.

571
00:50:09,126 --> 00:50:11,126
- Now as I was saying.
- Yes Vic?

572
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:15,910
Helen, you look so wonderful
tonight. Could I interest you in a
slightly used kiss?

573
00:50:18,476 --> 00:50:19,276
Now what do you guys want?

574
00:50:19,715 --> 00:50:21,115
We had to go back to camp. We
forgot the music.

575
00:50:21,617 --> 00:50:23,417
Well don't bother me. Give it to
Sam at the piano.

576
00:50:24,256 --> 00:50:25,256
Okay Serg.

577
00:50:30,147 --> 00:50:33,147
- What's the matter Vic?
- Oh nothing. Just one of those things.

578
00:50:33,325 --> 00:50:34,925
Come on. What is it?

579
00:50:35,715 --> 00:50:37,315
- I didn't want to tell you...
- But what?

580
00:50:38,631 --> 00:50:40,231
- We're being alerted.
-Alerted?

581
00:50:41,986 --> 00:50:43,186
But Vic.

582
00:50:43,987 --> 00:50:45,587
Well what am I going to do when
you're gone?

583
00:50:46,352 --> 00:50:47,952
Why Helen, are you going to miss
me that much?

584
00:50:48,669 --> 00:50:50,069
Sure Vic.

585
00:50:51,167 --> 00:50:53,767
This might sound a little hokey, but I
wrote a song....

586
00:50:54,503 --> 00:50:56,503
..and I would like to make a record
of it, just for you.

587
00:50:57,709 --> 00:50:59,709
Oh Vic. That's nice.

588
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,520
Would you mind stepping into the
booth while I record it?

589
00:51:03,205 --> 00:51:04,405
I'd love to.

590
00:53:45,042 --> 00:53:48,442
All right Corwin. What are you doing?
Are you going to make this your life's work?

591
00:53:48,771 --> 00:53:51,571
What do you want from me? Why
don't you worry about what you are
doing and I'll worry about what I'm doing...

592
00:53:52,664 --> 00:53:56,464
I never made this stuff before in my
life. When those guys are ready, I'll
give it my all.

593
00:53:57,144 --> 00:54:00,344
Worry about what your doing, I'll
worry about what I'm doing, I've
never done anything like this before in my life.

594
00:54:01,373 --> 00:54:02,773
Who are you?

595
00:54:13,144 --> 00:54:17,144
Good boy Corwin, good boy. Now
let's got down to the dispensary.t.

596
00:54:17,953 --> 00:54:18,753
The what, the where?

597
00:54:19,012 --> 00:54:22,612
The little old dispensary. We're
going to take the little old arm, and
we're going to roll up the little old sleeve...

598
00:54:23,384 --> 00:54:25,984
then we'll get the little old needle
and give you a little old shot...

599
00:54:27,007 --> 00:54:28,807
and it aint' going to hurt a little old
bit. Come on.

600
00:54:28,991 --> 00:54:31,791
- You sure it ain't going to hurt?
- No it won't hurt you a bit. Come
on.

601
00:54:32,949 --> 00:54:34,149
Good boy, go ahead.

602
00:54:36,751 --> 00:54:40,151
Believe me, you won't even feel the little old
needle.

603
00:54:40,831 --> 00:54:42,031
I won't feel the little old needle?

604
00:54:42,556 --> 00:54:45,156
- Noooo, won't even hurt you a little bit?
- Won't even hurt me a little bit?

605
00:54:46,137 --> 00:54:46,737
Noooo.

606
00:54:47,179 --> 00:54:49,579
- Is it a square needle?
- Round needle.

607
00:54:49,582 --> 00:54:50,582
Next.

608
00:55:11,751 --> 00:55:12,751
Corwin!

609
00:55:15,625 --> 00:55:16,825
Now just relax.

610
00:55:20,218 --> 00:55:21,418
Roll up your sleeve.

611
00:55:21,441 --> 00:55:23,341
Think of something pleasant.

612
00:55:24,565 --> 00:55:26,265
You're eating ice-cream.

613
00:55:26,094 --> 00:55:28,494
You're dancing with a beautiful,
beautiful girl.

614
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:32,193
You're sleeping in a white dreamy bed.

615
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:39,802
I didn't bet to the last part.

616
00:55:41,268 --> 00:55:44,068
Now that didn't hurt a bit, did it?
How do you feel?

617
00:55:44,858 --> 00:55:47,658
Feel good? Okay. Come on, let's
go.

618
00:55:50,699 --> 00:55:52,099
Corwin!

619
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:55,590
Come in.

620
00:56:06,601 --> 00:56:09,001
- Does this finish up your maleria shots?
- Yes Corporal.

621
00:56:09,619 --> 00:56:12,419
- And me too.
- Here take this note into the mess sergeant.

622
00:56:14,031 --> 00:56:14,631
How do you feel?

623
00:56:19,352 --> 00:56:21,352
- You said it wouldn't hurt me.
- You'll live.

624
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,440
That's what I'm afraid of.

625
00:56:25,899 --> 00:56:27,099
- Good-morning Corporal.
- Good-morning Captain.

626
00:56:28,531 --> 00:56:29,731
As you were.

627
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:36,470
Puccinelli, I talked to Colonel
Davies and he is going to put you
on that overseas movement.

628
00:56:37,075 --> 00:56:38,075
That's swell Captain.

629
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:40,761
Coporal Clark tell you about the
army woman that was in army room yesterday?

630
00:56:42,302 --> 00:56:42,902
Yes sir.

631
00:56:43,012 --> 00:56:45,612
She's having trouble locating some
man in the company.

632
00:56:46,584 --> 00:56:47,984
And I want you to find the man.

633
00:56:48,311 --> 00:56:50,311
Yes sir. I'll try, but it won't be easy.

634
00:56:50,899 --> 00:56:52,499
She could make things nasty, if she
got to the Colonel.

635
00:56:53,629 --> 00:56:55,829
- Will you take care of it?
- I'll do my best sir.

636
00:56:56,165 --> 00:56:58,965
Good! As soon as you find the
man, I want to see him.

637
00:56:59,672 --> 00:57:00,472
Yes sir.

638
00:57:03,183 --> 00:57:06,183
How do you like that? Now I'm in
charge of domestic relations.

639
00:57:06,216 --> 00:57:09,016
Even that little old alert gag I pulled
on Millie just to kiss her a few times...

640
00:57:10,956 --> 00:57:12,956
Hey douse them lights. The
Colonel is coming by.

641
00:57:25,453 --> 00:57:29,053
Sarg Puccinelli, I'd like to see your
copy of the master training schedule

642
00:57:30,728 --> 00:57:33,528
It's supposed to be posted
on the bulletin board
Yes Sir

643
00:57:34,427 --> 00:57:37,227
Clark, show the Colonel
how we posted the schedule

644
00:57:43,385 --> 00:57:44,985
- It's here sir.
- I can't see it.

645
00:57:46,453 --> 00:57:48,053
It's, it's......I'm sure I put it here

646
00:57:48,366 --> 00:57:49,766
Well it doesn't seem to be here now.

647
00:57:50,995 --> 00:57:52,595
I think it's in the other room Colonel.

648
00:57:56,214 --> 00:57:57,814
- What was that?
- I think it's in the other room.

649
00:57:59,172 --> 00:57:59,972
Colonel.

650
00:58:21,746 --> 00:58:23,346
-Good-morning Colonel.
- Good-morning Caldwell

651
00:58:24,112 --> 00:58:26,112
We can't seem to find a copy of that
master training schedule.

652
00:58:26,456 --> 00:58:28,256
It should be posted in every orderly
room.

653
00:58:29,364 --> 00:58:30,764
It's probably there sir.

654
00:58:31,854 --> 00:58:34,554
- No it isn't on that board.
- I can't understand why it isn't up.

655
00:58:41,644 --> 00:58:42,644
Here it is.

656
00:58:47,914 --> 00:58:49,714
I hope it looks better than your
orderly room.

657
00:58:51,482 --> 00:58:53,082
Sergeant Puccinelli.

658
00:58:59,794 --> 00:59:00,994
Open that door!

659
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:31,220
I hope someday to see a copy of
that master training schedule.

660
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,120
We found it sir. It was posted under SOP.

661
00:59:36,692 --> 00:59:38,892
Ah yes. Well no wonder I didn't see
it. It's too dark in here.

662
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:43,379
Turn on those lights.

663
00:59:53,225 --> 00:59:54,225
Here's the envelope from ltalian.

664
00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:58,092
- So you're really going to ship me out?
- That's right.

665
00:59:58,739 --> 01:00:02,139
Well "Cutie". I had a nice little talk
last night with Millie and...

666
01:00:02,848 --> 01:00:03,448
And?

667
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,700
And I'll give you the rest of the day
to get my name off that list.

668
01:00:06,646 --> 01:00:08,846
Don't threaten me. Out!

669
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:11,865
Wait a minute.

670
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:13,380
It's a pleasure.

671
01:00:13,392 --> 01:00:15,592
Here's a telegram for Corwin. Give
it to him in the messhall.

672
01:00:17,626 --> 01:00:18,626
Sergeant Puccinelli.

673
01:00:19,125 --> 01:00:20,725
Colonel Davies is going to inspect
the supply room.

674
01:00:21,623 --> 01:00:23,423
-And following that, the messhall.
-Yes sir.

675
01:00:25,768 --> 01:00:27,168
- Miller!
- Yeah?

676
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:30,325
- The Colonel is going to inspect in
a minute. - Oh no Serg!

677
01:00:31,245 --> 01:00:32,245
Ditch this for me.

678
01:00:33,664 --> 01:00:36,864
Where am I going to hide this? A
long one for Louie.

679
01:00:37,347 --> 01:00:40,547
It's all right. We're part of the
charges.

680
01:00:41,998 --> 01:00:43,798
Captain, what's gotten into this
company?

681
01:00:44,494 --> 01:00:46,894
- Well a few things have gone wrong sir.
-A few things?

682
01:00:47,559 --> 01:00:48,959
Captain I have never....

683
01:00:52,695 --> 01:00:55,095
- What was that?
- Sounds like the messhall.

684
01:00:55,395 --> 01:00:56,195
Messhall?

685
01:00:58,347 --> 01:01:00,947
- Signal's over.
- What's the meaning of this?

686
01:01:03,833 --> 01:01:05,833
Sergeant Puccinelli, what's going
on here?

687
01:01:08,032 --> 01:01:10,432
What's that whistle? Is there a fire?
What is it?

688
01:01:11,385 --> 01:01:13,985
It's a baby. Vic look! It's a little
baby!

689
01:01:14,843 --> 01:01:17,543
Look when we first married, we
didn't think we'd have any, then...

690
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:21,050
we got a little....COLONEL!

691
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,720
Colonel said this is the most
outrageous company he's ever seen.

692
01:01:27,591 --> 01:01:28,991
He's cancelled you off that shipping
order.

693
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:31,340
- You mean I can't go overseas?
- That's right.

694
01:01:32,417 --> 01:01:33,817
Here it is in writing.

695
01:01:38,831 --> 01:01:40,631
I'm sorry sir. Yes sir.

696
01:01:43,711 --> 01:01:44,711
How do you like that?

697
01:01:45,554 --> 01:01:49,454
7 09. Five years in this man's army.
Five years and the day before I go
on shipping...

698
01:01:49,724 --> 01:01:51,124
I get caught in this filthy machinary.

699
01:01:53,075 --> 01:01:55,675
What's the first class this
afternoon? Calisthenics.

700
01:01:55,858 --> 01:01:58,958
Of fine, that's all I need. There's got
to be an easier way to make a living.

701
01:02:07,399 --> 01:02:10,199
I'm afraid this little number will keep
us busy for a week.

702
01:02:10,637 --> 01:02:12,637
- Oh good-afternoon Mrs. Caldwell.
- Good-afternoon.

703
01:02:14,078 --> 01:02:15,078
How soon will you be ready?

704
01:02:15,149 --> 01:02:17,749
Well, well, well. All dressed up to
go places, I see.

705
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:21,670
I'm afraid for once in my life, I have
a surprise for you.

706
01:02:22,755 --> 01:02:23,755
Really?

707
01:02:24,018 --> 01:02:26,018
It seems without consulting you..

708
01:02:26,305 --> 01:02:30,305
the Colonel has given B-company
officers a special problem which will
undoubtly take all night to do.

709
01:02:31,709 --> 01:02:32,309
What kind of problem?

710
01:02:33,789 --> 01:02:37,189
We have to identify a number of
South Pacific islands by their topography.

711
01:02:39,057 --> 01:02:41,057
- Sally said you wouldn't get that till
tomorrow.

712
01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:44,658
Then you must have done
something to anger Sally, because
she gave it to us today.

713
01:02:45,737 --> 01:02:46,937
Well I'll tell her a thing or two..

714
01:02:47,819 --> 01:02:49,219
I might have come out without the
answers.

715
01:02:51,342 --> 01:02:52,942
The answers?

716
01:02:53,505 --> 01:02:54,705
I've got them right here,
some place.

717
01:02:58,093 --> 01:02:59,493
Here you are.

718
01:03:02,444 --> 01:03:05,444
Munich, Straussberg, these aren't
the answers.

719
01:03:05,958 --> 01:03:07,158
Oh, that's C-company.

720
01:03:08,905 --> 01:03:10,105
Here's yours.

721
01:03:12,684 --> 01:03:15,284
Ero, colsoe, Dagora......

722
01:03:17,457 --> 01:03:19,057
If I thought there was another
woman like Dorthy on this earth...

723
01:03:19,945 --> 01:03:22,945
..I'd tell you to get married at once.

724
01:03:23,221 --> 01:03:24,821
I'm certainly glad you appreciate me.

725
01:03:25,677 --> 01:03:30,477
Well, I've got a few things to pick up
at the PX. And I'll be back to pick
you up in exactly 20 minutes.

726
01:03:36,045 --> 01:03:38,045
I'd better give this to Captain
Conner in C-company.

727
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:42,083
At ease men.

728
01:03:45,569 --> 01:03:49,369
- That Mc Vie. He wants another
good-conduct ribbon.
- How does he lose so many?

729
01:03:48,633 --> 01:03:51,433
I don't know . He gets plastered and
deal them out like fraternity pins.

730
01:03:52,983 --> 01:03:55,383
Hey, the Colonel is checking
calisthenics.

731
01:04:01,005 --> 01:04:03,805
- I beg your pardon sir.
- Yes, what is it?

732
01:04:04,387 --> 01:04:05,987
Colonel is checking orderly rooms...

733
01:04:20,872 --> 01:04:22,872
- Sergeant Miller on duty sir.
- Where is Segeant Puccinelli?

734
01:04:23,331 --> 01:04:25,931
With the company, taking calisthenics
sir. Shall I get him for you sir?

735
01:04:26,721 --> 01:04:27,721
No.

736
01:04:28,387 --> 01:04:30,187
No, the exercise will be good for him.

737
01:04:30,581 --> 01:04:30,981
Yes sir.

738
01:04:31,583 --> 01:04:32,383
- Miller. ..
- Yes sir?

739
01:04:32,929 --> 01:04:36,729
At ease. What's the name of that
Sergeant, the one with the whistle?

740
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:38,639
Oh you mean Mc Vie sir.

741
01:04:40,058 --> 01:04:45,258
I want you to find Mc Vie immediately.
Tell him to get this entire outfit on the
obstacle course in 10 minutes. Understand?

742
01:04:46,526 --> 01:04:47,526
Yes sir!

743
01:05:08,586 --> 01:05:09,786
Hey Corwin.

744
01:05:22,345 --> 01:05:24,345
Come on let's go. Head's down.

745
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:28,721
Come on you guys, keep it moving.
I want to hear them helmets. Keep moving.

746
01:05:48,099 --> 01:05:51,899
All right, come on. Come out fresh,
keep moving.

747
01:05:56,277 --> 01:06:00,077
Hey Corwin, come out. You're beginning
to fall back. Let's get out of there.

748
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:06,919
All right come on, keep crawling.

749
01:06:08,528 --> 01:06:11,128
All right let's go. Stay with it.

750
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:15,068
Come on let's go. You're holding it
up there.

751
01:06:19,936 --> 01:06:22,936
Come on Corwin, let's go. You're holding
up the detail. All the guys are waiting.

752
01:06:24,392 --> 01:06:25,792
On this side Corwin, are you crazy?

753
01:06:26,824 --> 01:06:28,424
On this side! Stay here now!

754
01:06:30,207 --> 01:06:31,407
Come on, you can do it.

755
01:06:37,617 --> 01:06:39,017
Taken like a bird.

756
01:06:50,484 --> 01:06:51,284
Corwin!

757
01:06:52,151 --> 01:06:54,351
- Yes Serg?
- You've got to stop this clowning.

758
01:07:04,886 --> 01:07:06,486
All right you guys, keep it low.

759
01:07:18,497 --> 01:07:19,497
Corwin!

760
01:07:20,427 --> 01:07:21,827
What happened to Corwin?

761
01:07:25,948 --> 01:07:27,148
Corwin!

762
01:07:40,868 --> 01:07:44,268
Okay, let's go. You're holding it up.
Look alive there.

763
01:07:48,042 --> 01:07:50,442
All right you guys. Come on now,
come on.

764
01:08:02,372 --> 01:08:06,372
Keep moving. What are you doing
up there? Mailing letters?

765
01:08:10,254 --> 01:08:12,054
Corwin...

766
01:08:13,944 --> 01:08:15,944
Hey Corwin you all right?

767
01:08:17,069 --> 01:08:18,869
Water! Get some water! Hurry up!

768
01:08:19,607 --> 01:08:20,807
Here you are Serg. What do I do
with it?

769
01:08:21,370 --> 01:08:22,370
Let him have it.

770
01:08:32,230 --> 01:08:33,430
Wait a second. Now take it easy.

771
01:08:34,886 --> 01:08:36,286
Come on. You all right Corwin?

772
01:10:31,983 --> 01:10:34,583
Well I'm glad to see that they finally
fixed that soft drink machine.

773
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:38,331
Well, I think I'll go in there and take
care of that supply sergeant now.

774
01:10:40,123 --> 01:10:44,123
You know, he turns the same
articles in for salvage over and over again.

775
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:48,010
You'd think he was going to open up
and army and navy store.

776
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:53,790
As you were.

777
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:56,350
-Sergeant Miller?
- Yes Sergeant?

778
01:10:59,084 --> 01:11:01,084
- Hey where's Sergeant Puccinelli?
- I don't know.

779
01:11:02,308 --> 01:11:03,308
Boy he's sure in trouble again.

780
01:11:04,114 --> 01:11:06,714
The Colonel's after him, the
Captain's after him and Millie's after him.

781
01:11:07,625 --> 01:11:09,625
I wouldn't trade places with him with
14 points.

782
01:11:21,256 --> 01:11:24,256
I see that you took care of that
supply situation to your satisfation.

783
01:11:26,445 --> 01:11:27,245
Yes sir!

784
01:11:28,077 --> 01:11:30,077
I don't think we'll have anymore
trouble with Sergeant Miller.

785
01:11:48,603 --> 01:11:52,303
Boy that was close! The Colonel
almost had me that time.

786
01:11:53,078 --> 01:11:55,678
- Got a cigarette.
- Yeah, sure Serg. Here, roll your own.

787
01:11:56,479 --> 01:11:57,479
That'll be all Sergeant Miller.

788
01:12:02,497 --> 01:12:04,097
What's Miller featuring today?

789
01:12:18,006 --> 01:12:19,206
- 40. medium?
- Yep.

790
01:12:30,445 --> 01:12:31,045
Yes sir?

791
01:12:31,137 --> 01:12:33,637
Have you made any progress
finding out about that girl?

792
01:12:35,869 --> 01:12:38,669
- What girl? - The one who was
in the orderly room yesterday.

793
01:12:39,148 --> 01:12:40,948
Oh yes sir. I have a hunch sir.

794
01:12:42,219 --> 01:12:43,619
I want to see that man as soon as
possible.

795
01:12:44,467 --> 01:12:45,467
Yes sir.

796
01:12:52,190 --> 01:12:54,590
- Hey where's Corwin?
- He's in the rec hall rehearsing.

797
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,120
Rehearsing for what? How to
become a mental case?

798
01:14:21,556 --> 01:14:23,156
- Okay, come on, let's go.
- Where?

799
01:14:23,374 --> 01:14:25,774
- To see Captain Caldwell.
- What'd I do now?

800
01:14:26,098 --> 01:14:29,298
- You'll find out and I'm delivering
you C.O.D. - What about the number?

801
01:14:30,203 --> 01:14:32,003
- What number?
- You promised Pokey you'd do it.

802
01:14:32,711 --> 01:14:34,111
Well tell him to get with it, but hurry up.

803
01:14:36,301 --> 01:14:37,101
All right, go ahead, ask him.

804
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:40,239
But watch how you ask him. In a
nice way. Use a little diplomacy.

805
01:14:40,547 --> 01:14:43,147
You say: Pokey, will you play a
song for Vic and I, we're going to dance.

806
01:14:43,814 --> 01:14:48,214
Cause you and me Alvin. We're
going to be together a long, long
time. You and me, we're friends right?

807
01:14:48,490 --> 01:14:52,290
So go ahead and ask Pokey. So go
ahead and ask him and I'll wait too.
Go ahead.

808
01:14:53,238 --> 01:14:56,638
You say: Pokey, play some music
for Vic and I. Go ahead. What are
you waiting for?

809
01:14:57,099 --> 01:14:58,099
Okay!!

810
01:14:59,483 --> 01:15:00,883
I forgot what I was going to ask him now.

811
01:15:02,510 --> 01:15:06,310
Oh yeah! Pokey, will you play this dance
song so that Vic and I can do this together?

812
01:15:06,876 --> 01:15:08,276
- Sure.
- Thanks a heap.

813
01:15:10,990 --> 01:15:12,990
-Old song and dance?
-Old song and dance?

814
01:16:13,475 --> 01:16:15,075
No, the whole band, they should
play it together.

815
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:22,143
What are you waiting for?

816
01:16:22,170 --> 01:16:24,170
Look buster, I don't do it unless the
Sergeant tells me.

817
01:16:26,653 --> 01:16:27,453
Okay folks.

818
01:16:51,211 --> 01:16:52,611
All right folks, let's quiet down now .

819
01:16:53,504 --> 01:16:57,504
We'd like to present First Sergeant
Victor Puccinelli and Private First
Class, Alvin Corwin.

820
01:16:58,316 --> 01:17:00,516
Doing their impression of two great
personalities.

821
01:17:15,659 --> 01:17:17,859
Well, top of the morning to you
friend.

822
01:17:19,827 --> 01:17:21,427
How are you me boy?

823
01:17:23,344 --> 01:17:25,944
I just thought I'd stop over now son,
and let you know that....

824
01:17:28,825 --> 01:17:32,025
I don't knock the idea of you leaving
in St. Dominique's charge.

825
01:17:31,728 --> 01:17:34,128
Well I kind of hate to see you leave
the place too padre.

826
01:17:35,799 --> 01:17:40,199
- I was just wondering if I might ask
a wee bit of a favor son.
-Well, go right ahead.

827
01:17:42,359 --> 01:17:46,159
I would love you to sing one of me
old Irish lullabyes. Just once now,
before you go.

828
01:17:47,478 --> 01:17:50,278
Now which little lrish lullabye you
thinking about?

829
01:17:51,306 --> 01:17:55,306
The one you did that night I was so
sick in bed son. You remember that
one, now don't you lad?

830
01:17:55,907 --> 01:17:59,907
Well, couldn't rightly do it for you
tonight Padre, for I got to have
music behind me, you know that.

831
01:18:01,085 --> 01:18:04,885
But I've got a musicbox with me.
Won't you try now son?

832
01:18:05,869 --> 01:18:09,669
- It should be a pleasure to do it for you.
- Just open it wide open.

833
01:19:24,226 --> 01:19:27,626
Sir, would you still like to see the
man I spoke to you about? The one
that caused all the trouble.

834
01:19:27,759 --> 01:19:28,959
- Most definetly!
- Yes sir.

835
01:19:30,059 --> 01:19:30,659
Corwin...

836
01:19:31,509 --> 01:19:32,509
Come here.

837
01:19:42,436 --> 01:19:45,236
Private First Class Corwin reporting
sir, as ordered.

838
01:19:45,581 --> 01:19:45,981
At ease.

839
01:19:47,086 --> 01:19:48,086
Corwin...

840
01:19:48,690 --> 01:19:49,490
What's your first name?

841
01:19:49,691 --> 01:19:50,891
- Alvin.
- Alvin?

842
01:19:51,854 --> 01:19:52,054
Yes sir.

843
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:56,670
Alvin, bringing children into the
world is a solemn matter.

844
01:19:58,138 --> 01:20:00,738
Solemn sir? I didn't think it was so
solemn.

845
01:20:01,328 --> 01:20:02,128
That's the trouble.

846
01:20:02,921 --> 01:20:04,721
Sometimes we don't realize it until
it's too late.

847
01:20:06,214 --> 01:20:08,414
Now, what do you intend to do
about this matter?

848
01:20:09,145 --> 01:20:10,345
Nothing sir. Everything been done
already.

849
01:20:10,851 --> 01:20:12,251
That's the wrong attitude entirely.

850
01:20:13,670 --> 01:20:16,670
-Aren't you ashamed?
- No sir. I'm very proud.

851
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:18,060
Proud?

852
01:20:18,081 --> 01:20:19,881
Yes sir. We wanted a baby, so we
got a baby.

853
01:20:21,025 --> 01:20:22,625
- You wanted a baby?
- Yes sir.

854
01:20:23,842 --> 01:20:27,242
But don't you understand? You
can't let this baby grow up without a name.

855
01:20:27,965 --> 01:20:29,365
I know. We'll think of a name for it.

856
01:20:29,756 --> 01:20:30,756
That's not what I mean.

857
01:20:31,987 --> 01:20:34,787
Now Corwin, listen to me closely.

858
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:37,139
Do you have any love for this
woman?

859
01:20:38,215 --> 01:20:41,415
- Yes sir. I love her very much.
- Then my job should be simple.

860
01:20:42,711 --> 01:20:46,511
I'm going to give you a three-day
pass, so that you can go to this girl
and do right by her.

861
01:20:47,251 --> 01:20:47,651
Oh thank-you sir.

862
01:20:48,290 --> 01:20:50,890
But understand, this pass is only to
give this baby a name.

863
01:20:52,526 --> 01:20:53,726
Three-day pass to think of a
name...

864
01:20:54,966 --> 01:20:55,966
I know sir, we'll name it after you.

865
01:20:56,603 --> 01:20:57,403
That's not necessary.

866
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:03,100
But I'll tell you this: when the baby
is born, I'll see to it that you get an
emergency furlow.

867
01:21:03,399 --> 01:21:05,999
But sir I..... No buts about it!

868
01:21:05,564 --> 01:21:10,164
Get into class A uniform.
- Yes sir.

869
01:21:16,363 --> 01:21:19,163
Puccinelli. I've decided to give
Corwin a three-day pass.

870
01:21:19,095 --> 01:21:20,895
Pass? But Captain, after what he
did?

871
01:21:21,681 --> 01:21:24,081
Well I have to give him a pass, so
he can get married.

872
01:21:25,370 --> 01:21:26,770
Get married? What for?

873
01:21:27,433 --> 01:21:31,033
Puccinelli. Is this or is this not the
man who is in trouble?

874
01:21:31,452 --> 01:21:35,652
Sir, yes sir! He's in trouble all right.
What he means is, the baby's
already been born.

875
01:21:37,319 --> 01:21:38,919
- Is that right Corwin?
- Ah, yes sir.

876
01:21:39,226 --> 01:21:40,226
Yes mam', yes sergeant.

877
01:21:41,368 --> 01:21:42,568
Oh, that's different. Give me that pass.

878
01:21:44,115 --> 01:21:47,315
- Oh but Captain!
- We'll give you an emergency furlow.

879
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:49,470
Oh thank-you.

880
01:21:49,683 --> 01:21:51,883
Get this Corwin, you'd better bring
back a marriage certificate.

881
01:21:52,708 --> 01:21:53,908
Oh that's easy. I got one in the
barracks.

882
01:21:54,816 --> 01:21:58,016
He doesn't mean his own sir. One of
the boys has one tacked up on the wall.

883
01:21:59,601 --> 01:22:01,001
Corwin, you'd better get ready to go.

884
01:22:02,131 --> 01:22:03,331
Yes Sergeant.

885
01:22:11,542 --> 01:22:14,142
- Well I'm off to battalion.
- Sir, do you want me to type up
these furlow papers?

886
01:22:14,233 --> 01:22:16,833
No, I'll have it done at
headquarters. I want to push it right through.

887
01:22:21,180 --> 01:22:22,580
Clark, don't leave me here alone.

888
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:25,755
- Cutie!
- Millie, what a surprise to see you here.

889
01:22:26,824 --> 01:22:29,024
Well, I've been trying so hard to see you.

890
01:22:29,955 --> 01:22:30,755
Millie, come here.

891
01:22:32,766 --> 01:22:35,166
- Now tell me the truth.
- Are you going to have.... Yes Vic.

892
01:22:36,362 --> 01:22:37,162
Where did you hear?

893
01:22:37,528 --> 01:22:39,328
Where did I hear? Well it's
practilly a coast to coast hook-up.

894
01:22:41,693 --> 01:22:43,493
Look honey. Step into the Captain's
office, just for a minute.

895
01:22:44,008 --> 01:22:45,808
NO! There's too much traffic in there.

896
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:47,039
Please Millie.

897
01:22:48,405 --> 01:22:49,205
Come in.

898
01:22:52,488 --> 01:22:56,088
Victor Puccinelli. I have a few
questions to ask you.

899
01:22:56,159 --> 01:22:56,759
Helen, listen.

900
01:22:57,143 --> 01:22:59,343
And the first one has to do with
Jack Edwards.

901
01:22:59,745 --> 01:23:00,945
Oh if that's all that's bothering you.

902
01:23:01,237 --> 01:23:03,237
- Listen Cutie.
- Please Millie.

903
01:23:05,203 --> 01:23:06,003
Who was that girl?

904
01:23:06,978 --> 01:23:08,178
Mrs. Caldwell, the Captain's wife.

905
01:23:09,391 --> 01:23:12,591
If you send Jack Edwards out of
this camp, you can consider our
relationship at an end.

906
01:23:13,772 --> 01:23:14,572
Oh you wouldn't do that, would you
honey?

907
01:23:15,736 --> 01:23:20,536
On the contrary. I'm not sure I'm in
love with either one of you. Well, I
want to be fair to you both.

908
01:23:21,499 --> 01:23:23,099
- Now look...
- Good-afternoon Sergeant.

909
01:23:23,707 --> 01:23:26,107
Captain Caldwell, Miss Palmer, I'd
like to have you meet her.

910
01:23:27,021 --> 01:23:28,021
-How do you do?
- How do you do?

911
01:23:29,810 --> 01:23:32,010
Captain, I think you are wanted
down at battalion headquarters.

912
01:23:35,946 --> 01:23:36,946
Can I help you?

913
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:39,050
Lt. Davenport!

914
01:23:40,279 --> 01:23:42,079
Now wait a minute. Don't mix me
up in this.

915
01:23:44,279 --> 01:23:46,279
- Maybe I'd better leave.
- No! One moment.

916
01:23:46,541 --> 01:23:48,541
You've made a startling recovery,
haven't you?

917
01:23:49,878 --> 01:23:51,278
I don't know what you're talking about.

918
01:23:52,330 --> 01:23:53,930
-Sergeant Puccinelli.
- Yes sir.

919
01:23:55,222 --> 01:23:57,022
There he is. Corwin, come in here.

920
01:23:57,286 --> 01:23:57,886
Sit down young lady.

921
01:23:59,241 --> 01:24:01,641
- Can you explain....
-First Class Corwin reporting as
ordered sir.

922
01:24:02,361 --> 01:24:06,161
Can you kindly explain why this
young lady is sitting here
completely recovered...

923
01:24:07,235 --> 01:24:08,035
...and you're about

924
01:24:09,719 --> 01:24:11,519
and you're about to start an
emergency furlow?

925
01:24:11,979 --> 01:24:13,379
Recovered sir? What was wrong
with her?

926
01:24:13,825 --> 01:24:15,225
Don't try to be funny.

927
01:24:15,772 --> 01:24:17,972
I don't understand Captain. I never
saw that woman before last night.

928
01:24:18,897 --> 01:24:20,097
You never saw her before last night?

929
01:24:21,073 --> 01:24:22,473
- No!
- Then why do you think you're
getting this furlow?

930
01:24:22,946 --> 01:24:24,746
Cause my wife had a baby.

931
01:24:25,604 --> 01:24:27,404
Your wife had a baby.

932
01:24:27,948 --> 01:24:29,948
Yes sir. Here's a telegram I got.

933
01:24:34,119 --> 01:24:35,319
Well, I think I get this now.

934
01:24:36,766 --> 01:24:39,366
-Do you know him?
- No, but he's cute.

935
01:24:41,365 --> 01:24:43,965
- Here's your furlow.
- Take it and get out. Thank-you
Captain. Yes sir.

936
01:24:45,530 --> 01:24:48,530
- And give my love to the baby.
- Yes sir, I will sir. Thank-you
Captain. Good-bye.

937
01:24:55,879 --> 01:24:56,879
Now young lady....

938
01:24:58,249 --> 01:24:59,849
Where is everybody? Sergeant
Puccinelli.

939
01:25:00,564 --> 01:25:00,764
Yes sir.

940
01:25:01,592 --> 01:25:03,792
Do you realize that this whole mess
is still up in the air? Corwin wasn't the man.

941
01:25:04,325 --> 01:25:04,925
He wasn't sir?

942
01:25:05,692 --> 01:25:07,292
I can't understand your attitude lately.

943
01:25:08,141 --> 01:25:09,341
I guess I'll have to take care of this
myself.

944
01:25:09,949 --> 01:25:12,149
Give me the company roster with
the physical descriptions of the men.

945
01:25:12,446 --> 01:25:12,846
Yes sir.

946
01:25:36,406 --> 01:25:41,406
Well, I suppose we should introduce
ourselves. I'm Helen Palmer and
this is ah....

947
01:25:43,358 --> 01:25:44,958
Captain Caldwell's wife.

948
01:25:46,364 --> 01:25:48,164
And, who are you?

949
01:25:49,473 --> 01:25:51,073
I'm not quite sure.

950
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:53,680
The Captain would like to see you.

951
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:56,520
Me? Oh, but I was just in there.

952
01:26:00,606 --> 01:26:03,406
Ernie Caldwell! What's the
meaning of this?

953
01:26:03,654 --> 01:26:04,654
She was introduced to me as your wife.

954
01:26:05,530 --> 01:26:06,530
Now wait a minute.

955
01:26:06,744 --> 01:26:08,944
What do you mean when you said
you had just been in here?

956
01:26:09,625 --> 01:26:12,825
I was just in here. I was here last
night too.

957
01:26:13,971 --> 01:26:17,171
The desk was here, there was a
chair there and over there.....

958
01:26:17,609 --> 01:26:19,809
Now darling, this is an army matter.
This is not your affair.

959
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:22,802
Now young lady, what's the
meaning of this.

960
01:26:22,982 --> 01:26:24,382
- Captain, I can.....
- Sergeant Puccinelli.

961
01:26:24,546 --> 01:26:26,946
-Ernie Caldwell! Can't you stay
outside until this is settled?

962
01:26:28,164 --> 01:26:29,564
If there's anything going on, I want
to know about it.

963
01:26:30,167 --> 01:26:32,567
Then let's both get outside and I'll
try to explain.

964
01:26:33,228 --> 01:26:35,228
- I don't understand...
- But Captain.

965
01:26:35,956 --> 01:26:37,156
Oh come on Millie, let's get out of here.

966
01:26:37,759 --> 01:26:39,559
But I still don't understand.

967
01:26:40,533 --> 01:26:42,333
Why is everybody picking on me?

968
01:26:43,390 --> 01:26:45,990
Hi ya Cutie! Well honey, what are
you doing here?

969
01:26:46,831 --> 01:26:49,831
I was worried. I came over here to
ask Vic about you going on that shipment.

970
01:26:50,478 --> 01:26:52,478
Oh don't worry. Cutie will see that I
don't go.

971
01:26:53,613 --> 01:26:55,213
Come on, why don't you give up?`
You can't win.

972
01:26:55,962 --> 01:26:57,362
Puccinelli, we have something that
must be settled.

973
01:26:57,688 --> 01:27:00,888
Now just a minute. For 5 years this
army has been deciding things for
me to do...

974
01:27:01,775 --> 01:27:04,775
But I'm in the driver's seat this time.
I don't want to be a warrant-officer.
I want to go overseas.

975
01:27:05,786 --> 01:27:07,186
I want to get away from everything.
Away from all this.

976
01:27:10,669 --> 01:27:12,469
That sir is something else I'm
deciding. I'm busting myself.

977
01:27:13,218 --> 01:27:15,418
- You can't do that.
- I can't, but you can do it for me.
Watch.

978
01:27:17,702 --> 01:27:19,502
- Oh honey.
- Ernie!

979
01:27:20,036 --> 01:27:21,436
- What did you call him?
- Ernie.

980
01:27:21,567 --> 01:27:23,267
- Did he say he was Ernie
Caldwell?
- Yes.

981
01:27:23,708 --> 01:27:24,908
- Then there is something.....
- Ladies, please!

982
01:27:25,705 --> 01:27:27,305
Now if you'll just wait dear.

983
01:27:30,427 --> 01:27:31,827
Is he the man you have been going
steady with?

984
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:34,380
- No, I only met him last night.
- Last night?

985
01:27:35,204 --> 01:27:37,204
Oh I think this whole thing is silly.
Let's get out of here.

986
01:27:38,919 --> 01:27:41,319
Now then Miss. You must have
gone out with another in this company?

987
01:27:41,974 --> 01:27:42,574
Present sir!

988
01:27:43,111 --> 01:27:46,711
So it's you Puccinelli. Well, I'm going
to give you exactly what you asked for.

989
01:27:47,984 --> 01:27:49,184
You'll be reduced to private and
shipped overseas.

990
01:27:49,883 --> 01:27:50,483
Thank-you sir.

991
01:27:50,959 --> 01:27:54,359
And don't think this relieves you of
your responsibilities to this woman
you are married to.

992
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:56,790
- Married to me?
- Now don't deny it.

993
01:27:57,240 --> 01:28:00,840
Oh but he isn't. I'm already
married, to someone else.

994
01:28:01,628 --> 01:28:05,828
John Slaker. Has been since a
week after I broke up with Vic.

995
01:28:06,250 --> 01:28:07,862
Well what have you been looking
for me for?

996
01:28:08,429 --> 01:28:11,304
Because I want to tell you not
to come and

997
01:28:11,707 --> 01:28:14,507
see me tonight, like you
promised 4 months ago.

998
01:28:14,622 --> 01:28:18,022
Before John and I were married.
You won't come, will you?

999
01:28:18,755 --> 01:28:19,755
Holy Toledo, no!

1000
01:28:21,396 --> 01:28:24,596
I'm so glad. My husband might not
understand.....

1001
01:28:25,766 --> 01:28:29,566
....he's not very bright and I don't
want to cause any trouble.

1002
01:28:30,323 --> 01:28:34,123
Oh well, good-bye and thanks so much.

1003
01:28:35,678 --> 01:28:37,678
- Don't think that this will clear you.
-We're still busting you.

1004
01:28:38,619 --> 01:28:40,819
Okay, so I'm busted. For once I've
beaten the army.

1005
01:28:41,462 --> 01:28:43,262
While all these other guys are
rotting here in the states....

1006
01:28:43,488 --> 01:28:45,488
.,...I'll be on the other side and the army
had nothing to do with it. I did it all myself.

1007
01:28:48,272 --> 01:28:49,872
- What the devil is that?
- I don't know sir.

1008
01:28:50,333 --> 01:28:51,333
It sounds like a special call.

1009
01:28:52,043 --> 01:28:55,643
Captain Caldwell. Have you heard
the news. All movements, transfers
and furlows have been cancelled.

1010
01:28:55,963 --> 01:28:56,763
- Movements cancelled.
- Sure.

1011
01:28:57,331 --> 01:28:58,331
Sure, the whole outfit is going
overseas.

1012
01:28:59,155 --> 01:29:01,555
- But darling, why didn't you?
- Sally never told me.

1013
01:29:02,736 --> 01:29:05,536
Ernie Caldwell. Step into my office.

1014
01:29:06,256 --> 01:29:08,056
You've got a lot of explaining to do.

1015
01:29:10,606 --> 01:29:11,406
Let go of me.

1016
01:29:11,810 --> 01:29:14,210
Serg, I just caught this man trying to
sneak off the boat.

1017
01:29:14,844 --> 01:29:16,044
Don't bother me, I'm out of business.

1018
01:29:16,869 --> 01:29:19,069
Sneak off the boat nothing. I've got
a furlow. I've got to see my baby.

1019
01:29:19,813 --> 01:29:21,613
-You ain't got no furlow.
- I have!

1020
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,520
- No you don't.
- I have!

1021
01:29:24,215 --> 01:29:25,015
QUIET!

1022
01:29:24,610 --> 01:29:26,010
- All furlows is cancelled.
-Cancelled!?

1023
01:29:27,127 --> 01:29:30,927
Right, the whole division is going
overseas.
- OVERSEAS!?

1024
01:29:33,151 --> 01:29:35,951
Wait a minute, you too.

1025
01:29:37,273 --> 01:29:42,273
That's right. Come on Private
Puccinelli. Join your buddy. Let's
be getting on the ball.

1026
01:29:46,726 --> 01:29:48,726
- Pick it up.
- Pick what up?

1027
01:29:48,903 --> 01:29:49,903
The suitcase.

1028
01:29:50,766 --> 01:29:52,366
Private Puccinelli.

1029
01:30:00,092 --> 01:30:01,092
Vic.

1030
01:30:04,207 --> 01:30:05,407
I'll take it.

1031
01:30:05,828 --> 01:30:07,428
- What?
- The bag.

1032
01:30:08,927 --> 01:30:10,927
Nah, come on. I'll take it.
