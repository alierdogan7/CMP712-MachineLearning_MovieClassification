1
00:01:20,812 --> 00:01:22,780
Don't forget to wish
the lawyer.

2
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:27,450
''Come here, Nathu.''
''- Yes, sir.''

3
00:01:34,092 --> 00:01:35,787
You're so very late!

4
00:01:36,094 --> 00:01:38,119
''l'm hungry. Let's go, Gopal.''
''- Come on, Sunder.''

5
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:45,792
Sunder hit Gopal and
he's bleeding.

6
00:01:48,372 --> 00:01:50,340
They're fighting again.

7
00:01:50,842 --> 00:01:53,470
Will you say that again?
- Yes.

8
00:01:53,845 --> 00:01:55,813
''What happened, Gopal?''

9
00:01:56,848 --> 00:01:59,817
Did Sunder hit you?
''- No, father.''

10
00:02:01,385 --> 00:02:03,819
l fell on a stone
and started bleeding.

11
00:02:04,122 --> 00:02:05,487
But Radha said Sunder hit you.

12
00:02:06,157 --> 00:02:08,489
She's lying.
- Yes he did! He did hit him!

13
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,828
''Shut up, Radha!''
When did he hit me?

14
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:12,619
''She's lying, father!''

15
00:02:12,997 --> 00:02:15,830
''Well done, my son.''

16
00:02:16,467 --> 00:02:20,426
You're bleeding but you won't
tattle on your friend.

17
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,247
''Look, Radha. l've built a house''
big enough for Gopal too.

18
00:02:36,621 --> 00:02:39,055
Will you live in my house now?
''- No, l won't.''

19
00:02:39,357 --> 00:02:40,847
Why not?
- lt's my wish!

20
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:43,327
l don't like your house!

21
00:02:44,162 --> 00:02:45,857
Had it been someone else
in your place...

22
00:02:46,564 --> 00:02:47,531
Let me go!

23
00:02:50,635 --> 00:02:54,469
''Well? Don't you know, l was''
a Captain in the army?

24
00:02:54,772 --> 00:02:56,535
''Let him be, sir''
He's a kid.

25
00:02:56,908 --> 00:02:59,877
''Keep him under control, Nathu.''
He's getting out of hand.

26
00:03:01,179 --> 00:03:02,874
You're being like a child yourself.

27
00:03:03,181 --> 00:03:05,877
''Go ahead and play, children''

28
00:03:06,184 --> 00:03:08,880
''Play with Gopal, Radha.''
Always play with equals.

29
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:13,882
He has a car.
But l have a plane.

30
00:03:14,926 --> 00:03:17,554
l'll fly Radha all over the world.

31
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:23,762
l'll take her away one day.

32
00:04:13,985 --> 00:04:14,917
No...

33
00:04:36,607 --> 00:04:38,973
Come down here and l'll show you!

34
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:38,095
Sunder! What are you doing?!

35
00:06:38,662 --> 00:06:41,631
l threw the hook in the water
and it fell on the ground.

36
00:06:41,932 --> 00:06:42,762
Return my clothes to me!

37
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,094
They won't get off the hook.
Like myself.

38
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,109
Say that again... l like
my name on your lips.

39
00:06:53,411 --> 00:06:55,003
Don't tease me.
Return my clothes to me!

40
00:06:55,813 --> 00:06:58,111
l will. But answer my
question first.

41
00:06:58,616 --> 00:06:59,446
l have a hundred times.

42
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,375
You've refused a hundred times
Say `yes' just once...

43
00:07:02,686 --> 00:07:06,952
or you won't get your clothes
- This is ridiculous.

44
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,451
lmagine for a moment that
l'm not Sunder... but Gopal.

45
00:07:13,297 --> 00:07:14,264
And Gopal asks you something.

46
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:49,963
''Your heart is the river Ganga''
''and mine is the river Yamuna''

47
00:07:50,401 --> 00:07:54,428
''Tell me, Radha...''
''will they ever find union?''

48
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,780
''No! Never!''

49
00:08:31,242 --> 00:08:40,207
''l've spend eons''
''pleading with you''

50
00:08:40,651 --> 00:08:49,559
''You'll find no other man''
''as persistent as l am''

51
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:53,226
''Will this burden''
''l carry, ever lessen?''

52
00:08:54,798 --> 00:08:57,824
''Tell me, Radha...''
''will our hearts ever meet?''

53
00:09:05,142 --> 00:09:06,040
''Get lost!''

54
00:09:25,496 --> 00:09:34,529
''l thirst for you as''
''the earth does for rain''

55
00:09:34,939 --> 00:09:43,540
''Every breath that l take''
''seems to chant your name''

56
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:48,680
''The stones melt,''
''but will your heart?''

57
00:09:49,053 --> 00:09:50,953
''Tell me, Radha,...''
''will our hearts ever meet?''

58
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:12,305
''Yes, they will!''
''Now go away''

59
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:18,907
''Radha, listen...''

60
00:11:20,944 --> 00:11:22,707
Gopal's returning from
London tomorrow!

61
00:11:24,815 --> 00:11:29,047
Do you hear?
Gopal's returning from London!

62
00:12:40,724 --> 00:12:42,453
Aunty!

63
00:12:46,797 --> 00:12:49,459
She's in the prayer room.

64
00:12:50,033 --> 00:12:51,796
What happened?
- Gopal...

65
00:12:56,173 --> 00:12:58,141
What happened? He was okay...
- Not just okay.

66
00:12:58,475 --> 00:13:02,673
He's great! He has stood first
in the whole of the University!

67
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,073
Really?
- Of course.

68
00:13:05,382 --> 00:13:10,012
l'm the one who tutored him!
''Read this, if you can't believe me.''

69
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:13,217
l'll go and tell everyone.
''- Sweeten your tongue, at least.''

70
00:13:13,524 --> 00:13:14,491
Later!

71
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:18,091
Raghu! Look at this...

72
00:14:03,473 --> 00:14:05,998
Sunder isn't here.
''He knows, doesn't he?''

73
00:14:07,044 --> 00:14:09,535
Of course. He's been
telling everyone.

74
00:14:09,847 --> 00:14:10,939
Why hasn't he come then?

75
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:13,474
He will. At least to the party.
- Party?

76
00:14:15,252 --> 00:14:16,219
Yes. ln your honour.

77
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,438
''Well, lawyer?''
How are you?

78
00:14:45,616 --> 00:14:46,913
Why didn't you come
to receive me?

79
00:14:47,217 --> 00:14:52,587
l did. On my bicycle.
But you sped away in your car.

80
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:57,054
l kept calling for you
but you wouldn't hear me.

81
00:15:00,163 --> 00:15:02,461
''You're wearing garlands,''
l see.

82
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:06,599
This one? l brought it for you.
''l wore it, because l didn't meet you.''

83
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,797
What's the difference between
the two of us anyway?

84
00:15:09,172 --> 00:15:13,609
l feel as if l've turned a lawyer
after you got the degree.

85
00:15:14,044 --> 00:15:16,604
'' But now that l meet you,''
''here you are, my friend.''

86
00:15:21,051 --> 00:15:22,814
You've been away
for so very long.

87
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:26,756
Let's sit here.

88
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,894
Have you quit the Air Force
and joined flight work?

89
00:15:32,195 --> 00:15:35,221
Yes. l train people
in flying.

90
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:39,161
But l don't get the one
l want to take to the skies.

91
00:15:45,943 --> 00:15:50,778
l can't tell you what l went through
when l met Gopal today.

92
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:53,982
Mustn't you ask Gopal too?

93
00:15:56,987 --> 00:15:58,978
Do you mean?
- No.

94
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,653
To play together as kids
''is one thing, Radha.''

95
00:16:04,227 --> 00:16:07,196
But to live together as husband
and wife is another.

96
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,669
All right. l will say it
to him at the party tonight.

97
00:16:20,978 --> 00:16:23,276
Congratulations. You're one
of us lawyers now.

98
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,673
Thank you. Please sit down.

99
00:16:31,855 --> 00:16:34,346
''Why're you hiding here, Captain?''

100
00:16:34,858 --> 00:16:38,021
l'm watching how the game goes.

101
00:16:38,729 --> 00:16:41,892
Fine. But you've glass is empty.
Let me get you a drink.

102
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:44,690
What shall l get you?
- Don't l get a drink?

103
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:54,306
What can l get you?
- Ask what l've got for you.

104
00:16:54,611 --> 00:16:56,704
What've you got?
- Look there.

105
00:17:04,755 --> 00:17:06,245
l'm here for the
fun of it.

106
00:17:06,623 --> 00:17:09,387
But she's here to say
something to you.

107
00:17:10,027 --> 00:17:12,052
What?
- Only she knows.

108
00:17:14,297 --> 00:17:17,528
l forgot...
Let me get you a drink.

109
00:17:17,868 --> 00:17:20,302
Don't bother
- l'll get it...

110
00:17:20,604 --> 00:17:25,268
Not you. There's no dearth
of servants in this house.

111
00:17:25,575 --> 00:17:29,067
Let her. lt's time she learns
the ways of this family.

112
00:17:29,446 --> 00:17:31,744
After all she has to
come here as a bride.

113
00:17:33,984 --> 00:17:37,750
You look lovely.
Who's it all for?

114
00:17:47,397 --> 00:17:50,628
What was Sakina saying?
- The truth.

115
00:17:51,802 --> 00:17:54,771
''l mean, what did she say?''
- That you wanted to speak to me.

116
00:17:55,605 --> 00:17:57,368
''Congratulations, Gopal.''
- Thanks

117
00:17:59,142 --> 00:18:00,109
You look lovely.

118
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,771
Sunder hasn't come yet.
Strange fellow!

119
00:18:09,986 --> 00:18:10,782
Did you speak?

120
00:18:11,154 --> 00:18:14,783
How could l? There're too
many people around.

121
00:18:15,826 --> 00:18:18,795
Your friend Sunder isn't here?
- Must be on his way.

122
00:18:30,307 --> 00:18:31,274
Here he is!

123
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:37,277
Can't you ever be on time?
Not even today?

124
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:39,811
l can't hide things from you.

125
00:18:40,117 --> 00:18:41,880
l have only one suit.

126
00:18:42,252 --> 00:18:44,812
My pants were torn and
l had to sew them.

127
00:18:45,122 --> 00:18:47,955
l wanted to dress well.
''Radha's coming, you know.''

128
00:18:48,391 --> 00:18:49,551
ls she here?
- Yes

129
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,225
Where's she?
- There.

130
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:56,355
Tell Gopal everything
you want to.

131
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,827
''How can l, with that fool''
hovering around him?

132
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,505
''Stay close, Gopal.''

133
00:19:05,475 --> 00:19:08,239
My heart could stop beating...
And my pulse?

134
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:10,574
Go and say `hi'.
l'll join you later.

135
00:19:10,947 --> 00:19:12,039
Must l?
- Go on!

136
00:19:19,689 --> 00:19:21,623
Oh no! He's coming here.

137
00:19:21,892 --> 00:19:23,826
l'll take care of Sunder.
Go and find Gopal.

138
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:27,018
''Welcome, Sunder.''

139
00:19:28,365 --> 00:19:30,526
Say MlSTER Sunder.
l'm suited and booted

140
00:19:30,901 --> 00:19:33,665
Right. MlSTER Sunder.
We don't meet nowadays.

141
00:19:34,037 --> 00:19:36,005
Quite right. We hardly meet.

142
00:19:39,442 --> 00:19:41,410
Talk to Sakina. l'll be back.

143
00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:47,139
So talk to me.

144
00:19:47,651 --> 00:19:50,882
About what?
- About Radha.

145
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:54,682
Radha? Go ahead.

146
00:19:55,258 --> 00:19:58,819
l'm told you love her.
- ls it public knowledge?

147
00:19:59,129 --> 00:20:01,825
May l suggest something?
- Please do.

148
00:20:02,265 --> 00:20:03,892
Ask Radha what she wants.

149
00:20:05,202 --> 00:20:09,901
Suppose you both want
different things?

150
00:20:11,341 --> 00:20:14,902
That's why l'm here - to
confess my feelings.

151
00:20:15,345 --> 00:20:16,573
l'll ask her today.

152
00:20:16,947 --> 00:20:18,915
Don't worry.
Will you have a drink?

153
00:20:19,482 --> 00:20:20,244
Excuse me.

154
00:20:20,951 --> 00:20:24,648
Do you see how different
Sunder and Gopal are?

155
00:20:24,955 --> 00:20:27,253
''One, a worthy son of''
a worthy father.

156
00:20:27,557 --> 00:20:30,924
He's a lawyer and will
be a judge one day.

157
00:20:31,494 --> 00:20:33,462
The other one's a
good-for-nothing.

158
00:20:33,897 --> 00:20:37,264
And he comes here today
like a band-master.

159
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:42,067
''Say whatever you will,''
but Sunder is a gem of a boy.

160
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:46,432
''Which is why, Captain,''
he's my dearest friend.

161
00:20:46,977 --> 00:20:49,673
You're always biased
against him.

162
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:56,351
Never mind his appearance.
He's the life and soul of any party.

163
00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:01,090
What is it?

164
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:05,489
Did you meet Sunder?

165
00:21:05,862 --> 00:21:08,228
l came to say something to you.

166
00:21:08,531 --> 00:21:11,967
l've never dared to say it
to you before.

167
00:21:13,336 --> 00:21:15,463
''The Judge wants you, son.''
Come on.

168
00:21:15,805 --> 00:21:16,635
l'll be back.

169
00:21:31,021 --> 00:21:33,990
Your friend isn't eating.

170
00:21:34,557 --> 00:21:37,583
''Sunder, won't you eat?''
- l can't. l'll choke.

171
00:21:37,894 --> 00:21:38,792
Why?

172
00:21:41,364 --> 00:21:45,596
Not unless l speak to her.
l'm incapable of anything.

173
00:21:46,036 --> 00:21:48,266
How will you speak?
Will you play?

174
00:21:48,638 --> 00:21:51,607
Yes. l'll play and sing.

175
00:21:51,908 --> 00:21:54,138
Very good. Music gives
life meaning.

176
00:21:54,444 --> 00:21:58,676
''Which is why, a heart that''
''loves, will speak in song.''

177
00:21:58,982 --> 00:22:00,950
Wonderful.
- Such poetry.

178
00:22:01,251 --> 00:22:03,344
Then develop the poem.
- Go on.

179
00:22:07,457 --> 00:22:12,019
Every heart that loves
will speak out in song.

180
00:22:13,663 --> 00:22:16,564
and a lover in a crowd
will stand out.

181
00:22:18,134 --> 00:22:19,032
Wonderful!

182
00:22:34,517 --> 00:22:39,045
''A heart that loves''
''will speak out in song''

183
00:22:44,594 --> 00:22:48,587
''A lover in a crowd''
''will stand out''

184
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:18,289
''Having stolen my heart,''
''you hide yourself from me''

185
00:23:18,928 --> 00:23:27,097
''Though my love is unrequited,''
''my feelings for you abide''

186
00:23:28,471 --> 00:23:39,109
''This is what love is about;''
''although you do not know it''

187
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:44,610
''The candle-flame that burns''
''will draw the moth to it''

188
00:24:28,531 --> 00:24:37,838
''Forgotten memories''
''of our happy childhood''

189
00:24:38,341 --> 00:24:46,180
''come to trouble''
''my dreams at night''

190
00:24:47,484 --> 00:24:51,511
''l've never dared''
''to speak my heart''

191
00:24:52,222 --> 00:24:57,524
''Though countries seasons''
''have come and gone''

192
00:24:58,561 --> 00:25:03,328
''When will these eyes''
''be brave enough to speak?''

193
00:25:03,733 --> 00:25:07,362
''A lover in a crowd''
''will stand out''

194
00:25:56,085 --> 00:26:05,255
''Everyone has spoken...''
''but l cannot speak my heart''

195
00:26:06,095 --> 00:26:13,263
''The story of my heart''
''shall remain forever untold''

196
00:26:14,837 --> 00:26:25,543
''Having united two hearts,''
''this outsider will leave''

197
00:26:25,848 --> 00:26:29,284
''A lover in a crowd will be''
''recognised, without doubt''

198
00:26:56,879 --> 00:26:58,312
''Sakina, won't you dance?''

199
00:26:58,615 --> 00:27:00,845
Forget about me. Ask Radha.

200
00:28:08,418 --> 00:28:12,377
You wouldn't know how much
l have waited for you.

201
00:28:43,653 --> 00:28:47,214
l'm writing this to
answer your question.

202
00:28:47,457 --> 00:28:50,893
But l don't know myself
what the answer is.

203
00:28:51,127 --> 00:28:53,891
Shameless! Reading
another's letter?

204
00:28:54,797 --> 00:28:58,096
Another? So you've discarded
all of us for him?

205
00:28:59,469 --> 00:29:01,437
Never mind. l'll deliver
the letter for you.

206
00:29:02,939 --> 00:29:06,705
As if l couldn't do it myself.
- So why did you keep it here?

207
00:29:07,009 --> 00:29:11,241
l thought l'd give it to him.
- Really?

208
00:29:14,484 --> 00:29:15,314
Now wait..

209
00:29:17,754 --> 00:29:22,123
l'm taking this paper along.
l'll send you the draft notice.

210
00:29:22,492 --> 00:29:26,121
Mr lawyer... could you
come upstairs please?

211
00:29:26,496 --> 00:29:28,589
Sakina's calling you!
Let me accompany you...

212
00:29:35,438 --> 00:29:36,803
Where are you going?

213
00:29:36,973 --> 00:29:40,465
Sakina called him.
- lt was Radha; not Sakina.

214
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,278
l'm not bothered. l'm going too...
- Why not?

215
00:29:43,513 --> 00:29:49,474
''The army captain, aren't you?''
Come on now!

216
00:29:49,786 --> 00:29:50,810
All right... let's go.

217
00:29:51,921 --> 00:29:55,482
Did you call me?
- Not me. lt was Radha.

218
00:29:56,526 --> 00:29:58,494
''Well, Radha?''

219
00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:13,502
Tell him!
- What's bothering you?

220
00:30:14,076 --> 00:30:16,374
''ln that case, l'll tell him.''

221
00:30:16,746 --> 00:30:17,838
''Actually, Radha has...''

222
00:30:26,088 --> 00:30:30,047
Looks like you've been joking.
And l got taken in.

223
00:30:34,564 --> 00:30:36,054
You didn't give him
''the letter, Radha.''

224
00:30:38,835 --> 00:30:42,601
What's the hurry?
l will give it to him.

225
00:30:42,905 --> 00:30:47,205
He's sitting downstairs.
- He's leaving!

226
00:30:47,577 --> 00:30:49,067
l'll give it to him.
C'mon!

227
00:31:02,058 --> 00:31:02,547
My God!

228
00:31:03,593 --> 00:31:05,356
What do we do now?
- Deliver the letter?

229
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,104
Hurry up.

230
00:31:25,548 --> 00:31:27,243
''Coming, father.''

231
00:31:27,683 --> 00:31:33,588
''Come, let's go. lf father''
''comes up, it's the end.''

232
00:31:52,575 --> 00:31:55,408
lt's in Hindi.

233
00:31:55,645 --> 00:31:59,206
My teacher always said one
should learn Hindi.

234
00:31:59,916 --> 00:32:01,076
l wish l had learnt it.

235
00:32:25,207 --> 00:32:31,908
Gopal! l've got it!
- Got what?

236
00:32:32,148 --> 00:32:34,639
A priceless treasure!
''That is, this letter.''

237
00:32:35,685 --> 00:32:36,652
Letter?
- Yes! lt will decide my fate

238
00:32:36,953 --> 00:32:40,787
''l'm at your mercy, Gopal!''
- What are you doing?

239
00:32:41,691 --> 00:32:43,784
Only you can read and
tell me my fate

240
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:48,859
''Tell me, friend, if l'm''
on the Everest or in the hell ?

241
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,798
What does it say ?

242
00:32:56,105 --> 00:32:57,333
Beloved ...

243
00:32:57,707 --> 00:32:58,674
Beloved ?

244
00:33:07,516 --> 00:33:09,541
Say it again.
- Beloved.

245
00:33:10,653 --> 00:33:13,144
''Take this cup away,''
for l am drunk.

246
00:33:13,589 --> 00:33:18,686
What kind of a joke is this ?
- You won't understand. Read on

247
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:24,496
ln your eyes l have seen a question.
Am l right ?

248
00:33:25,001 --> 00:33:29,495
Absolutely! Read on

249
00:33:31,007 --> 00:33:32,372
l am writing to answer
your question

250
00:33:33,342 --> 00:33:34,832
''Go and, give me my answer!''

251
00:33:35,544 --> 00:33:38,707
''The answer is, l don't know''
what my answer is

252
00:33:39,048 --> 00:33:43,178
l dream of the things
l would tell you

253
00:33:43,552 --> 00:33:45,713
'' But l stand before you,''
and my tongue is tied

254
00:33:46,022 --> 00:33:47,046
This is an ancient story...

255
00:33:47,356 --> 00:33:49,324
that has inspired poets

256
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:54,927
Maybe this is love

257
00:33:55,264 --> 00:33:56,993
''Yours, Radha''

258
00:34:03,706 --> 00:34:05,003
My...? Radha ?

259
00:34:08,778 --> 00:34:12,145
''Hold me Gopal, ere l fall''

260
00:34:14,717 --> 00:34:15,411
''What's melodrama is this, Sunder ?''
- This is love

261
00:34:15,785 --> 00:34:19,687
This thing called love

262
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:27,418
ls a river of fire
that drowns the lover

263
00:34:27,797 --> 00:34:30,027
l've seen my share of
drowning lovers

264
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,894
Happens only in poetry.

265
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:38,167
Have you ever been in love ?
- Yes

266
00:34:40,076 --> 00:34:43,705
With whom ?
- Radha.

267
00:34:51,887 --> 00:34:54,913
ls there only one
Radha in the world ?

268
00:34:55,291 --> 00:34:58,260
Which other Radha ?

269
00:34:58,627 --> 00:35:05,055
There was one Radha.
She was Lord Krishna's beloved

270
00:35:05,367 --> 00:35:17,472
Oh...that Radha ?

271
00:35:18,314 --> 00:35:21,477
''For a moment, l almost died''

272
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:27,616
''Look, my hands have gone cold.''
My blood seems to have turned to ice

273
00:35:33,195 --> 00:35:35,629
l'm madly in love with Radha!
l can't live without her

274
00:35:40,402 --> 00:35:46,773
'' But believe me, if you were in love''
''with my Radha, l would've given her up''

275
00:35:47,076 --> 00:35:51,376
lt'd break my heart. But l'd sacrifice
my love for friendship

276
00:36:17,907 --> 00:36:19,465
What are you lost in?

277
00:36:19,842 --> 00:36:23,209
l'm right here with you

278
00:36:23,512 --> 00:36:27,141
l was thinking...
- You think more than you do

279
00:36:28,784 --> 00:36:29,614
''Tell me, what do l do?''

280
00:36:29,919 --> 00:36:33,878
''You just do what l say,''
and no arguments

281
00:36:34,256 --> 00:36:37,487
''All right, no arguments.''
''- First, we go boating tomorrow''

282
00:36:37,793 --> 00:36:39,021
''Yes, it's a Sunday''

283
00:36:39,395 --> 00:36:40,293
But l have work

284
00:36:40,596 --> 00:36:42,621
Can't you give a day for me?
''- For you, l'd even give up my life''

285
00:36:46,402 --> 00:36:48,700
Then give your life.
Come with me

286
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:57,373
Pick up the phone

287
00:36:57,813 --> 00:37:03,979
Dial a number

288
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,717
This is Radha's number.
- Right. Tell her that...

289
00:37:06,088 --> 00:37:10,115
you're going boating tomorrow

290
00:37:10,626 --> 00:37:14,528
''Hello, Captain. Gopal here.''
- You pick up Radha at three...

291
00:37:14,964 --> 00:37:18,058
How are you?
- Doesn't matter!

292
00:37:20,502 --> 00:37:22,333
''Captain, tomorrow being a Sunday,''
we're going boating

293
00:37:24,373 --> 00:37:27,934
Very well. Radha will come too

294
00:37:30,646 --> 00:37:34,548
Gopal called. He has invited us
to go boating with him tomorrow

295
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:37,284
Us ?
- And Radha too

296
00:37:39,455 --> 00:37:41,616
Radha too? Or Radha only?

297
00:37:43,192 --> 00:37:45,353
l don't know... but l'm going!
''- But of course, you won't''

298
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:48,630
''Leave her alone. For her, it has''
just begun. Let it happen

299
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:55,028
What better a match for Radha?

300
00:37:55,337 --> 00:37:59,501
''Now, how would l know all that?''
- How would you? All you know...

301
00:37:59,942 --> 00:38:07,906
''is that in 1916, you were a Captain.''
- Was l not ?

302
00:38:13,689 --> 00:38:16,852
Big party?
- No. Small party. For two

303
00:38:18,627 --> 00:38:20,720
Get lost

304
00:38:26,168 --> 00:38:29,001
Radha sits here

305
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:32,002
Here's Gopal

306
00:38:33,175 --> 00:38:36,736
And here l am

307
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,545
Radha of the intoxicating eyes

308
00:38:47,723 --> 00:38:50,157
''And Gopal, the friend in need''

309
00:38:50,592 --> 00:38:53,891
''My friend, and my lover''

310
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,507
ls this any time to come ?
l've been waiting all my life

311
00:39:16,952 --> 00:39:20,388
Did you invite Sunder too ?
- He's the one who invited us

312
00:39:21,824 --> 00:39:23,985
The phone call ?
- He made me call you

313
00:39:25,961 --> 00:39:28,452
What're you waiting for ?
Come along

314
00:39:37,506 --> 00:39:38,131
How are you Radha ?

315
00:39:42,778 --> 00:39:43,540
l hear you've bought a boat ?

316
00:39:43,846 --> 00:39:45,074
Yes. l'm sailing today.
lt's a sight

317
00:39:46,915 --> 00:39:48,212
lt's a lovely boat
- Show me

318
00:39:48,917 --> 00:39:52,284
''Go on Gopal, take a look''
- l'm coming too

319
00:39:52,654 --> 00:39:57,751
Where are you off to ?
l'm showing you my boat. Come

320
00:40:00,396 --> 00:40:03,763
Who are you looking at ? Gopal ?
- No...

321
00:40:04,066 --> 00:40:08,560
Mothing wrong. Not a friend like him
in the whole world

322
00:40:09,004 --> 00:40:12,098
''When l'm in pain, he cries''

323
00:40:12,541 --> 00:40:14,509
''When l'm happy, he rejoices.''
Like yesterday

324
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:17,438
What happened yesterday ?
- Read your letter

325
00:40:17,813 --> 00:40:19,371
''You read it, too ?''
''- No, Gopal did''

326
00:40:20,349 --> 00:40:27,653
Gopal and l share all our secrets.
''Nice, isn't it?''

327
00:40:27,823 --> 00:40:28,721
Where's your boat ?

328
00:40:38,834 --> 00:40:40,529
How is it ?

329
00:40:40,903 --> 00:40:42,131
Such a small one ?

330
00:40:42,671 --> 00:40:48,337
How many can sit in it ?
- Two. You and l

331
00:40:49,178 --> 00:40:53,808
''Two's a pair, three is a crowd,''
and four makes a gang of thieves

332
00:40:55,317 --> 00:40:57,683
Which is the pair ?

333
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:03,649
There's only one pair. You and l.
l'm right. Am l not ? Tell me

334
00:41:08,397 --> 00:41:10,831
How do you like my boat ?
- Beautiful

335
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:12,493
''Come over, then''

336
00:41:12,935 --> 00:41:17,031
Radha won't sit in your rotten boat.
- Then will she sit in your tub ?

337
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:22,505
She who sails with me
sits in my heart

338
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:31,853
That's a bloody lorry.
- She's a nymphet

339
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,388
Nymphet ? She's a paper boat.
And those girls are paper dolls

340
00:41:37,426 --> 00:41:40,987
Don't you show off.
Take that junk out of the waters

341
00:41:44,633 --> 00:41:48,467
''He puts a lorry in the water,''
and he goes begging for passengers

342
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:50,805
Good riddance !

343
00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:02,077
So what were you saying ?

344
00:42:05,521 --> 00:42:09,423
Can you say how deep the lake is ?
- Maybe 20 or 30 feet

345
00:42:11,126 --> 00:42:15,358
ls there anything deeper ?
- Why not? The ocean

346
00:42:17,065 --> 00:42:21,229
Deeper than the ocean ?
- l don't know

347
00:42:21,603 --> 00:42:27,508
''Your eyes, Radha, your eyes.''
Let me drown in them

348
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:32,246
''Sunder, this is what l don't like. You''
always make a joke out of everything

349
00:42:33,549 --> 00:42:40,455
''Sometimes, you're fun, but... l know''
you're good at heart. And l like you.

350
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:44,523
But everything has limits and
sometimes you cross the limit

351
00:42:46,828 --> 00:42:50,855
''Tell me then, what are my limits ?''

352
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:53,599
l don't know.
- Tell me Radha! What are my limits?

353
00:42:54,303 --> 00:42:57,204
l don't know !
''- Tell me, what are the limits ?''

354
00:42:57,472 --> 00:42:58,769
l don't know! l don't know!

355
00:44:27,195 --> 00:44:31,029
''Oh, my beloved...''

356
00:44:37,539 --> 00:44:41,373
''Oh my beloved''

357
00:45:16,111 --> 00:45:22,414
''To reach your heart''
''is my only goal''

358
00:45:30,792 --> 00:45:34,626
''There is no corner in my life...''

359
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:36,625
''that you do not invade''

360
00:46:10,298 --> 00:46:15,998
''Why are you angry ?''
''Why so sad ?''

361
00:46:17,439 --> 00:46:23,867
''There is no need, for our hearts''
''shall know union''

362
00:47:05,086 --> 00:47:11,047
''l shall take you in the''
''circle of my arms''

363
00:47:12,227 --> 00:47:18,598
''l shall carry you away, someday''

364
00:47:33,315 --> 00:47:36,409
''Oh, my beloved''

365
00:47:37,219 --> 00:47:43,818
''To reach your heart''
''is my only goal''

366
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:34,140
Radha ? Gopal here

367
00:48:37,245 --> 00:48:39,543
ls the Captain at home ?
- No

368
00:48:40,115 --> 00:48:41,139
And your mother ?

369
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:47,618
''She's out, too. Can't you tell me ?''
- l'm coming this evening to see them

370
00:48:48,924 --> 00:48:51,950
Tell them it's important.
We have to discuss something

371
00:48:53,194 --> 00:48:56,630
Discuss ?
- Yes. About you

372
00:48:57,933 --> 00:48:59,161
About me ?

373
00:49:07,208 --> 00:49:10,974
''Sakina, do you know''
who called ? Gopal

374
00:49:11,413 --> 00:49:14,974
He's coming to meet father
about something important

375
00:49:15,517 --> 00:49:19,248
About me. What could it be ?

376
00:49:20,689 --> 00:49:22,657
''Tell me, Sakina''

377
00:49:26,027 --> 00:49:29,656
''He'll say, l don't like Radha!''
She's ugly and she's foolish

378
00:49:29,965 --> 00:49:31,523
Marry her off to Sunder

379
00:49:35,704 --> 00:49:39,663
Don't you ever say that again!
Don't even joke about it

380
00:49:51,553 --> 00:49:56,217
Serve the drinks and leave. Girls
mustn't be present on such ocassions

381
00:49:57,158 --> 00:49:58,216
''Why not, Ma ?''

382
00:49:58,393 --> 00:50:02,693
He won't be able to talk freely

383
00:50:07,002 --> 00:50:07,969
Be seated

384
00:50:11,206 --> 00:50:14,698
How are you ?
- Fine. And you ?

385
00:50:15,377 --> 00:50:16,366
''Fine, thank you''

386
00:50:19,814 --> 00:50:22,374
How are you ?
''- Fine, thank you''

387
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:25,314
And your mother ?
''- Fine, thank you''

388
00:50:42,837 --> 00:50:43,861
How are you ?

389
00:50:45,206 --> 00:50:48,403
''Fine, thank you. And you ?''

390
00:50:50,445 --> 00:50:51,412
''Fine, thank you''

391
00:51:15,804 --> 00:51:16,771
You... here ?

392
00:51:22,577 --> 00:51:25,375
What madness is this? Why did you
have to scale the wall?

393
00:51:25,814 --> 00:51:30,717
For you l could wade through
''a river of fire, the sea of death''

394
00:51:31,219 --> 00:51:34,916
What kind of a joke is this?
''Sunder, please go away''

395
00:51:35,423 --> 00:51:36,117
'' But, why ?''

396
00:51:36,424 --> 00:51:40,986
''Downstairs, they're discussing''
something important. About me

397
00:51:41,162 --> 00:51:43,062
l know

398
00:51:43,498 --> 00:51:46,467
Gopal is here.
- Naturally. Who else do l have ?

399
00:51:46,668 --> 00:51:50,263
''Oh, why don't you understand?''
Go away now

400
00:51:51,439 --> 00:51:56,809
Till death do we part
You look beautiful

401
00:51:57,846 --> 00:52:02,806
''l tell you again, Sunder''
is a wonderful match

402
00:52:03,518 --> 00:52:07,750
You expect me to give my Radha away
to that oaf?

403
00:52:08,123 --> 00:52:15,495
''He has neither education, nor wealth''
How will he maintain my Radha ?

404
00:52:15,864 --> 00:52:20,096
''lf someone asks what he does,''
what am l to say ?

405
00:52:20,735 --> 00:52:25,365
That he left the Air Force
to join a flying club?

406
00:52:25,874 --> 00:52:27,034
No way

407
00:52:28,143 --> 00:52:32,375
Marriage will make Sunder
a responsible man.

408
00:52:32,881 --> 00:52:38,444
He's a gem of a person.
- But l am no jeweller

409
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:41,711
l'm sorry to be refusing you

410
00:52:42,223 --> 00:52:47,354
l know you're his friend and
you've come here for his sake

411
00:52:48,296 --> 00:52:49,388
But l'm helpless

412
00:52:50,565 --> 00:52:53,864
May l suggest something ?
- Yes ?

413
00:52:54,502 --> 00:52:57,403
We'd be willing to let
Radha marry you

414
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:02,877
Me ?

415
00:53:06,381 --> 00:53:10,545
Consider it
- l can never

416
00:53:12,253 --> 00:53:16,417
Are we so lowly ?
- l didn't mean that

417
00:53:16,925 --> 00:53:17,892
There must be a reason

418
00:53:20,929 --> 00:53:23,762
ls Radha unworthy ?
- What are you saying?

419
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,898
The man who gets to marry her
will be very lucky

420
00:53:28,269 --> 00:53:31,830
Then what's your objection ?
- Objection ?

421
00:53:37,612 --> 00:53:40,172
Not a matter of objection.
A matter of obligation

422
00:53:40,949 --> 00:53:44,646
''l'm just as helpless,''
as you are

423
00:53:46,487 --> 00:53:47,715
''Out of my way, Sunder''

424
00:53:47,889 --> 00:53:50,915
How can l ? My fate
is to be decided today

425
00:53:51,226 --> 00:53:55,526
''Then, hear me out ! l don't like you.''
Have you ever seen your face ?

426
00:53:59,367 --> 00:54:04,930
l see it now. ln your eyes.

427
00:54:06,107 --> 00:54:07,472
And it looks all right

428
00:54:07,709 --> 00:54:11,770
''No, it doesn't ! A man must''
be more than just a funster

429
00:54:13,081 --> 00:54:15,208
What must he be ?
- Let me go

430
00:54:15,583 --> 00:54:19,952
Tell me what a man must be
and l'll become that

431
00:54:20,255 --> 00:54:21,950
l don't know !

432
00:54:33,601 --> 00:54:37,628
Don't tell Radha that
Gopal came for Sunder

433
00:54:38,539 --> 00:54:40,973
Just say he came to talk
of marriage...

434
00:54:41,276 --> 00:54:43,301
and we said we'd
think it over

435
00:54:43,911 --> 00:54:46,812
One can't say 'yes' at the
very beginning

436
00:54:48,016 --> 00:54:53,818
l'm sure Gopal will be back
to say that he'll marry her

437
00:55:07,368 --> 00:55:12,465
''l tried everything, Sunder, but...''
''- Say no more, Gopal''

438
00:55:13,308 --> 00:55:16,334
'' Believe me, l tried''
- Why are you repeating it?

439
00:55:17,045 --> 00:55:22,278
l don't want you to think that...
- Does it remain to be said that...

440
00:55:22,517 --> 00:55:24,280
you'd leave no stone unturned for me?

441
00:55:27,322 --> 00:55:31,281
l have to become something.
Radha said that too

442
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:36,497
A man must make more of himself
than just a clown

443
00:55:37,332 --> 00:55:40,699
l will. l'll make myself worthy

444
00:55:44,172 --> 00:55:51,578
''Don't be sad. Come on, smile''
Keep smiling. Always

445
00:55:54,015 --> 00:55:55,642
You have a beautiful smile

446
00:55:56,818 --> 00:56:00,982
Only Radha's smile can match
the beauty of your smile

447
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:06,583
Her smile is as radiant as
all the sunflowers in the world

448
00:56:10,765 --> 00:56:11,595
''Well, then...''

449
00:56:21,642 --> 00:56:25,544
Where are you taking me?
''- Come with me, l'll explain''

450
00:56:25,947 --> 00:56:31,613
What is the matter? Where are we
headed? l don't understand this

451
00:56:33,321 --> 00:56:34,618
You'll come to know

452
00:56:55,676 --> 00:56:58,941
''So boys, you have been briefed about''
your mission.

453
00:56:59,747 --> 00:57:04,377
Only one more thing l've to tell you.
Don't forget...

454
00:57:04,685 --> 00:57:08,382
that you are flying
the lndian Air Force

455
00:57:08,623 --> 00:57:12,787
And the Air Force has full faith
''in your courage, and your patriotism''

456
00:57:41,255 --> 00:57:43,416
Sunder... you... here ?

457
00:57:46,093 --> 00:57:52,430
What's this Sunder? This uniform...
these planes...? What's all this?

458
00:57:53,668 --> 00:57:57,695
lt was you who told me that there's
more to life than being just a clown

459
00:57:57,972 --> 00:58:00,440
A man must make something of himself

460
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:05,436
''This is an Air Force uniform,''
and l fly that airplane

461
00:58:06,047 --> 00:58:09,448
l'm flying off today.
- Where ?

462
00:58:10,751 --> 00:58:13,117
l'm not allowed to reveal that

463
00:58:19,093 --> 00:58:20,185
''Just a minute, Gopal''

464
00:58:24,499 --> 00:58:27,730
l'm leaving. l don't know
when l'll return

465
00:58:28,503 --> 00:58:30,937
'' Before l leave, l want''
to tell you something

466
00:58:31,572 --> 00:58:32,732
''Go ahead, Sunder''

467
00:58:33,474 --> 00:58:38,537
You're everything to me...
''mother, father, brother and friend''

468
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:43,810
While l am gone no third man
must come between Radha and me

469
00:58:44,585 --> 00:58:45,552
Say you promise

470
00:58:46,521 --> 00:58:51,891
''Tell me Gopal, you promise''
''l promise, Sunder''

471
00:58:54,929 --> 00:58:58,365
lt's another matter if l die
- Die ?

472
00:59:01,269 --> 00:59:02,759
''What are you saying, Sunder?''

473
00:59:03,938 --> 00:59:07,135
''l won't die, Radha. l won't die.''

474
00:59:08,276 --> 00:59:12,235
l'll come back to you... for you

475
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:14,433
''Sunder, listen...''

476
01:00:18,879 --> 01:00:22,975
''Sunder, listen to me''
l have something to tell you

477
01:00:26,621 --> 01:00:31,786
Don't get the wrong idea
''l don't love you, Sunder''

478
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:36,592
l don't love you !
''Take care, Sunder''

479
01:01:08,729 --> 01:01:11,357
l won't die Radha

480
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,302
l'll come back to you... for you

481
01:01:47,168 --> 01:01:50,228
''Gopal, l can face every danger''
in this world

482
01:01:50,638 --> 01:01:54,404
What l can't fight is the darkness
in my mind...

483
01:01:54,575 --> 01:01:56,668
which seem to grow when
l don't hear from Radha

484
01:01:56,977 --> 01:02:01,243
A darkness that not all the light
in the universe can quell

485
01:02:01,849 --> 01:02:05,683
Go to Radha today.
Tell her to write to me

486
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,088
''Else, l'll go mad''

487
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:19,696
Go to Radha today.
Tell her to write to me

488
01:02:20,601 --> 01:02:22,694
''Else, l'll go mad''

489
01:02:25,372 --> 01:02:28,705
''Remember, how we used to play family''
when we were kids?

490
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:32,438
''You and l, and Sunder''

491
01:02:33,147 --> 01:02:36,981
You would insist that
l stay with you

492
01:02:37,618 --> 01:02:40,052
''And Sunder used to say,''
Radha will live with me

493
01:02:42,490 --> 01:02:46,187
He says that even today.
- Even today ?

494
01:02:46,627 --> 01:02:50,119
Why haven't you answered
his letters ?

495
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,463
l just haven't.
- Why not ?

496
01:02:57,638 --> 01:03:03,474
''Child's play is one thing, and making''
a family is quite something else

497
01:03:04,712 --> 01:03:08,739
''For me, Sunder is no more''
than a childhood friend

498
01:03:46,554 --> 01:03:50,786
lf you had a woman's heart
you'd know my feelings

499
01:03:51,492 --> 01:03:52,720
What are your feelings ?

500
01:03:54,094 --> 01:03:56,528
l love someone else.
- Whom ?

501
01:03:58,098 --> 01:03:59,065
You

502
01:03:59,366 --> 01:04:01,926
Are you mad ?
- No. But you're driving me mad

503
01:04:02,102 --> 01:04:06,801
Even hearing this is a sin for me!
- Then l shall pay for your sins

504
01:04:07,107 --> 01:04:11,373
'' But tell me, for once,''
have you never loved me ?

505
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:14,377
No!
- You're lying! Lying

506
01:04:14,782 --> 01:04:16,807
Your relationship with Sunder
has always silenced you

507
01:04:17,051 --> 01:04:20,543
''Were it not for my friendship,''
l would've told you something today

508
01:04:20,754 --> 01:04:25,088
''l plead with you, tell me''
what you want to say

509
01:04:25,326 --> 01:04:29,023
l want to talk of Sunder
who's battling death

510
01:04:29,597 --> 01:04:32,828
''Day and night, he lives''
in the shadow of death

511
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,567
He has only one image
before his eyes

512
01:04:36,737 --> 01:04:38,102
Yours

513
01:04:39,607 --> 01:04:43,907
''lf he wanted to suffer, why''
did he have to choose you?

514
01:04:44,945 --> 01:04:49,848
l have enough pain of my own.
Why did l choose you ?

515
01:05:30,658 --> 01:05:31,625
Kishan...

516
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:36,960
What is it ?

517
01:05:37,998 --> 01:05:42,901
A letter. ln Hindi. From Radha.
Read it out for me

518
01:05:44,672 --> 01:05:45,900
Dear Sunder...

519
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:52,768
Take care of yourself.
You said you'd return to me

520
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,981
l wait for that day.
''Yours, Radha''

521
01:06:01,588 --> 01:06:02,919
Mine. Radha

522
01:06:05,626 --> 01:06:11,656
You're lucky to have Radha's love
and Gopal's friendship

523
01:06:29,383 --> 01:06:30,577
''Yours, Radha''

524
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:39,687
The teacher was right.
The knowledge of Hindi is necessary

525
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:17,587
''Sing something else, won't you?''
You're always singing that sad song

526
01:07:18,632 --> 01:07:21,726
There's much in life
to be happy about

527
01:07:22,102 --> 01:07:26,334
You have reason to be happy. Your
girlfriend didn't break your heart

528
01:07:27,041 --> 01:07:31,205
Your friend didn't betray you.
''Else, you too would've said it too''

529
01:07:31,445 --> 01:07:35,074
''My friend, is a friend no more.''
''My love, is my love no more''

530
01:07:35,682 --> 01:07:38,276
''My life, l trust you not''

531
01:07:50,330 --> 01:07:54,027
Nothing can be done.
Our men are besieged

532
01:07:54,468 --> 01:07:58,427
We can't even send them supplies

533
01:07:58,939 --> 01:08:00,031
Why not ?

534
01:08:00,641 --> 01:08:02,438
The planes can't reach them

535
01:08:02,743 --> 01:08:04,438
The opening to the valley
is narrow...

536
01:08:04,678 --> 01:08:07,772
and every inch is being held
by the enemy

537
01:08:10,417 --> 01:08:12,510
Give me permission sir.
Let me try

538
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:15,786
You're a bomber pilot.
This needs a Dakota

539
01:08:16,323 --> 01:08:19,121
No job is too small in times of war.
''Give me the permission, sir.''

540
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:22,254
You're asking for death

541
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:26,061
Death for myself.
Life for my brother soldiers

542
01:08:26,567 --> 01:08:31,664
''Give me a chance, sir. l promised''
someone l'd do something worthy.

543
01:08:32,439 --> 01:08:33,337
Let me go

544
01:13:42,749 --> 01:13:47,118
l told him he was asking
for death

545
01:13:48,722 --> 01:13:54,592
''He said, it would mean life''
for his brother soldiers

546
01:13:54,761 --> 01:13:58,788
Just what l feared
What a man he was

547
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:05,802
We regret to inform you that
''your friend, Flt.Lt. Sunder Khanna...''

548
01:14:06,039 --> 01:14:08,872
met his death while
fighting the enemy

549
01:15:03,964 --> 01:15:07,456
This award is presented
posthumously...

550
01:15:07,767 --> 01:15:10,861
''to Flt.Lt. Sunder Khanna,''
35 Squadron...

551
01:15:11,104 --> 01:15:16,007
who risked his life to drop supplies
to soldiers at the front

552
01:15:16,176 --> 01:15:18,474
He gave his life to filfill
his mission

553
01:15:25,252 --> 01:15:28,221
but he battled death as he
continued to drop supplies

554
01:15:28,855 --> 01:15:33,883
Flt.Lt. Khanna has upheld the highest
ideals of the Air Force

555
01:15:34,094 --> 01:15:38,827
''His courage, his spirit of sacrifice''
and his sense of duty

556
01:15:38,999 --> 01:15:42,901
will go down in the annals of the
lndian Air Force in golden letters

557
01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:47,236
For selfless service
to the country...

558
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:52,070
the Government of lndia presents
this award to Flt.Lt. Khanna

559
01:15:52,879 --> 01:15:55,780
Flt.Lt. Khanna's dear friend

560
01:17:19,299 --> 01:17:21,927
l won't die. l'll come back...

561
01:17:22,636 --> 01:17:24,866
to you... for you

562
01:17:52,999 --> 01:17:55,695
His words still echo in my ears

563
01:17:56,936 --> 01:18:02,636
''l'll return, Radha. l will.''
To you...for you

564
01:18:04,911 --> 01:18:09,780
What a man he was.
So full of love

565
01:18:11,217 --> 01:18:15,381
He'd sacrifice his life
for a friend...

566
01:18:15,689 --> 01:18:17,384
and the world
for his beloved

567
01:18:18,692 --> 01:18:20,717
While leaving he entrusted
something to me

568
01:18:22,696 --> 01:18:23,924
His beloved ?

569
01:18:28,768 --> 01:18:32,670
You knew ?
l told him...

570
01:18:33,106 --> 01:18:40,672
not to misunderstand...
that l didn't love him

571
01:18:46,453 --> 01:18:52,414
''l loved you, Gopal...''
l love you

572
01:18:55,528 --> 01:18:59,294
Tell me the truth.
Don't you love me ?

573
01:19:00,567 --> 01:19:04,765
''You do, don't you ?''

574
01:22:12,659 --> 01:22:17,358
''Do l write ''''My beloved''''?''

575
01:22:18,665 --> 01:22:22,624
''Do l write ''''My Beauty''''?''

576
01:22:23,937 --> 01:22:28,499
''Or do l say ''''My sweetheart''''?''

577
01:22:30,009 --> 01:22:41,648
l'm at a loss
What should l write?

578
01:22:46,693 --> 01:22:47,921
Let go of my dress!
- Give me my letter

579
01:22:48,161 --> 01:22:50,652
''Let go, l say''
''- First, my letter''

580
01:22:51,297 --> 01:22:52,264
Why ?

581
01:22:53,166 --> 01:22:54,656
Aren't you ashamed of reading
someone else's love-letter ?

582
01:22:54,968 --> 01:22:57,198
Aren't you ashamed of writing
love-letters ?

583
01:23:02,542 --> 01:23:10,347
''Do not be angry''
''when you read my letter''

584
01:23:10,917 --> 01:23:18,221
''For you are my life,''
''you are my very own''

585
01:23:54,961 --> 01:24:02,333
''l could call you the moon,''
''but the moon is flawed''

586
01:24:10,777 --> 01:24:18,013
''l could call the sun,''
''but the sun is not perfect''

587
01:24:18,651 --> 01:24:25,750
''The only thing left to say''
''is that l love you''

588
01:25:01,994 --> 01:25:09,628
''You're as pure as the Ganga,''
''as pristine as the Yamuna''

589
01:25:17,777 --> 01:25:25,081
''You're so close to my heart''
''that you are my very being''

590
01:25:25,618 --> 01:25:34,083
''l fear that l might die''
''waiting for you to be mine''

591
01:25:37,196 --> 01:25:44,568
''Do not be angry''
''when you read my letter''

592
01:25:44,871 --> 01:25:52,107
''For you are my life,''
''you are my very own''

593
01:27:22,969 --> 01:27:27,804
Gopal! My son! My darling!

594
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:29,769
Come with me.
- What is the matter?

595
01:27:29,976 --> 01:27:34,936
Take your father's blessings
What's happening ?

596
01:27:35,248 --> 01:27:37,773
Do it. Pay him your obeisances.
- But what's it about?

597
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:40,885
''Ask for your father's blessings,''
Mr Magistrate

598
01:27:41,187 --> 01:27:44,213
Magistrate ?
- You've become a magistrate

599
01:27:48,661 --> 01:27:51,221
May you live long.
Ask for his blessings

600
01:27:53,532 --> 01:27:55,625
Your son has fulfilled
your wish

601
01:27:56,469 --> 01:27:59,961
''Son, vow that you shall''
always do justice

602
01:28:02,275 --> 01:28:07,838
''l vow, l shall always do justice''
''- First of all, give me justice''

603
01:28:08,014 --> 01:28:11,711
What...?
- Get a daughter-in-law for me

604
01:28:12,551 --> 01:28:16,920
As you wish. Have l ever disobeyed
you? Go ahead and do what you want

605
01:28:17,223 --> 01:28:20,454
Then l'll go to her house
to finalise the match right today

606
01:28:20,693 --> 01:28:23,924
'' But, who's the girl ?''
- As if you don't know...?

607
01:28:24,163 --> 01:28:28,259
How would l know ? l practise law.
l don't chase girls

608
01:28:28,768 --> 01:28:31,532
Radha
- Who ? Radha ?

609
01:28:33,239 --> 01:28:37,266
''Oh, well ...''
- Why? Don't you like her ?

610
01:28:38,577 --> 01:28:45,608
How does that matter ? A noose is
''a noose, be it of silk or cotton''

611
01:28:45,785 --> 01:28:48,686
l know everything

612
01:28:55,061 --> 01:28:59,691
''When you read my letter,''
do not be angry

613
01:29:00,599 --> 01:29:05,298
''For you are my life,''
my very own

614
01:31:36,419 --> 01:31:43,450
''That l am, for others. But for you,''
l will always remain the same.

615
01:31:44,260 --> 01:31:46,990
Your willing prisoner
- Prisoner ?

616
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:55,459
My mother will go to see
your mother very soon

617
01:31:56,505 --> 01:31:58,735
Why ?

618
01:31:59,942 --> 01:32:07,610
''She'll say, ''''You have a queen''
''in your house, and l have a slave''

619
01:32:10,853 --> 01:32:13,083
Then the queen will buy this slave

620
01:32:14,257 --> 01:32:18,023
And your mother will take home
a devoted maid

621
01:32:42,451 --> 01:32:45,784
Gopal ! Come here

622
01:32:52,495 --> 01:32:55,862
l've been waiting for you.
''- What is it, Ma ?''

623
01:32:56,232 --> 01:32:58,860
l nearly went mad with joy
when l heard the news

624
01:32:59,035 --> 01:33:01,526
What news?
- You'll be overjoyed to hear it

625
01:33:03,105 --> 01:33:06,541
Read this. Sunder is alive

626
01:33:08,044 --> 01:33:11,138
God be thanked !
What else could l want?

627
01:33:11,314 --> 01:33:14,215
You've become a magistrate.
l'm getting a daughter-in-law

628
01:33:15,184 --> 01:33:18,153
''And now, God has given me''
Sunder back too

629
01:33:18,421 --> 01:33:21,549
l'm going to the temple.
l must thank The Gods

630
01:33:55,624 --> 01:33:58,320
''l didn't know this, Sunder''

631
01:34:02,298 --> 01:34:06,132
You don't know what a terrible thing
l was about to do

632
01:34:07,903 --> 01:34:13,205
''l was about to betray you,''
usurp your place

633
01:34:15,644 --> 01:34:19,205
''Had it happened, how would l''
have faced you ?

634
01:34:21,884 --> 01:34:24,876
What man would've trusted
a friend then?

635
01:34:26,322 --> 01:34:28,620
What man would swear
by friendship then?

636
01:34:30,926 --> 01:34:34,885
''Thank God, you're alive''

637
01:34:46,675 --> 01:34:51,908
''Did you hear, Gopal ?''
Sunder is alive !

638
01:34:52,148 --> 01:34:57,245
l'm so happy l can't tell you

639
01:35:02,224 --> 01:35:06,320
How could we have got
married without him ?

640
01:35:06,529 --> 01:35:10,863
Our wedding would've
been incomplete

641
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:13,933
Hurry! lt's time for the train

642
01:35:15,237 --> 01:35:16,932
Get up ! Move

643
01:35:18,374 --> 01:35:20,433
l'm not going.
- Why ?

644
01:35:23,379 --> 01:35:27,213
lf he doesn't see you with me at
''the station, what will he think?''

645
01:35:28,250 --> 01:35:33,347
That's what l'm wondering. lf he sees
''you with me, what will he say?''

646
01:35:35,858 --> 01:35:42,957
''He'll say, ''''Congratulations Gopal,''
''Radha is yours''

647
01:35:44,733 --> 01:35:45,961
And what do l say ?

648
01:35:49,472 --> 01:35:53,909
''Say, ''''Meet Radha''
''My Radha''

649
01:35:58,147 --> 01:36:03,983
He's your best friend. He must be
the first to know of our marriage

650
01:36:06,889 --> 01:36:12,987
He should be the last to know.
''ln fact, he shouldn't know at all''

651
01:36:19,301 --> 01:36:23,601
''Who knows what dreams, what desires''
he comes with ?

652
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:27,006
What dreams ?
What desires ?

653
01:36:29,712 --> 01:36:31,009
Dreams about you

654
01:36:35,251 --> 01:36:40,348
Now my mother will never
go to meet yours

655
01:36:43,192 --> 01:36:44,284
Why not ?

656
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:49,360
''Why not, l ask you?''
- What would Sunder think ?

657
01:36:50,399 --> 01:36:54,165
What about what l think ?
What will my parents think ?

658
01:36:55,237 --> 01:36:58,764
Sunder is my dearest friend

659
01:37:04,413 --> 01:37:10,045
And l am to be sacrificed for
''your friendship... my life, my love''

660
01:37:13,756 --> 01:37:17,522
''First, l am sacrificing''
my own love and my happiness

661
01:37:19,595 --> 01:37:21,187
''And next, l shall ask for yours''

662
01:37:22,331 --> 01:37:27,132
l won't sacrifice myself !
l won't! Do you hear me ?

663
01:37:28,604 --> 01:37:31,801
Go away ! Go away from here !

664
01:38:56,191 --> 01:38:58,557
May The Lord preserve you !

665
01:39:00,863 --> 01:39:02,421
We received your wire today

666
01:39:03,465 --> 01:39:05,763
lsn't Gopal here ? Where is he ?

667
01:39:19,481 --> 01:39:21,711
Mr Magistrate ! How are you ?

668
01:39:22,484 --> 01:39:27,183
''How are you, Sunder ?''
- See for yourself. All in one piece

669
01:39:27,489 --> 01:39:35,191
l'm not an easy man to break.
- You've come at the right time

670
01:39:36,265 --> 01:39:40,201
We were so upset.
And look at you now

671
01:39:41,236 --> 01:39:43,602
Stand straight.
- What're you doing ?

672
01:39:44,239 --> 01:39:46,207
l'm casting away the evil eye

673
01:39:46,909 --> 01:39:53,280
Do it to Gopal instead. l'm tough.
l'd come back even from death

674
01:39:53,916 --> 01:39:58,216
To meet Gopal.
- Death to your enemies

675
01:40:08,731 --> 01:40:10,892
What are you doing with the papers ?

676
01:40:11,467 --> 01:40:14,493
Here's a man back from the dead.
You can't have bigger news

677
01:40:15,003 --> 01:40:17,494
And the dead man is sitting
right in front of you

678
01:40:19,675 --> 01:40:20,573
Come off it

679
01:40:23,278 --> 01:40:26,645
You're still the same
ebullient self

680
01:40:33,355 --> 01:40:36,256
'' But you've changed, Gopal.''
- What do you mean ?

681
01:40:37,025 --> 01:40:42,258
You aren't the Gopal l knew. You don't
even seem happy at that l've returned

682
01:40:42,631 --> 01:40:45,395
l thought you'd go wild with joy

683
01:40:46,969 --> 01:40:51,133
What a thing to say ? How can l not
be happy to have you back ?

684
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:55,542
Maybe l'm just too old to
break out into a jig

685
01:41:00,249 --> 01:41:01,546
''Tell me, how's Radha ?''

686
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:06,688
She's well. Very well

687
01:41:09,725 --> 01:41:15,891
''Look, l still get the gooseflesh''
when l even think of Radha

688
01:41:18,667 --> 01:41:26,699
''And my heart says, when she sings,''
let me play on

689
01:41:29,812 --> 01:41:33,714
Come Gopal. Let's go to Radha's place

690
01:41:34,349 --> 01:41:37,580
There can be no hurdle now.
l've become worthy

691
01:41:38,353 --> 01:41:43,052
Why not? She's been waiting for you

692
01:41:43,625 --> 01:41:45,991
See her... ?
- l've things to do

693
01:41:47,429 --> 01:41:50,330
You haven't yet done the most
important thing in life !

694
01:41:50,632 --> 01:41:53,533
What's that ?
''- Falling in love, you fool''

695
01:41:53,769 --> 01:41:56,067
l've been away for two years.
And what've you done in two years ?

696
01:41:56,438 --> 01:41:58,599
Couldn't you even
find yourself a Radha ?

697
01:42:00,976 --> 01:42:03,945
Shame on you

698
01:42:12,454 --> 01:42:14,354
Yes. The good-for-nothing oaf. Sunder

699
01:42:21,463 --> 01:42:24,091
''Janki, look who's here''
- Who is it ?

700
01:42:26,668 --> 01:42:29,102
Sunder ! My son !

701
01:42:31,773 --> 01:42:33,638
''Radha, look who's come home''

702
01:42:34,142 --> 01:42:35,109
Sit down

703
01:42:36,478 --> 01:42:38,105
l cried so much for you

704
01:42:39,381 --> 01:42:41,281
We got terrible news

705
01:43:08,277 --> 01:43:09,244
''How are you, Sunder ?''

706
01:43:16,251 --> 01:43:21,655
l promised l'd return.
See? l'm back

707
01:43:22,424 --> 01:43:23,516
All in one piece

708
01:43:25,761 --> 01:43:29,390
Why is everyone standing ?
Sit down

709
01:43:29,598 --> 01:43:31,361
l'll get some drinks

710
01:43:36,805 --> 01:43:38,033
''Excuse me for a moment, please''

711
01:43:40,509 --> 01:43:44,468
''l want to see, to feel, the one''
thing that didn't let me die

712
01:43:44,780 --> 01:43:46,839
We had heard...
- And it was true

713
01:43:47,950 --> 01:43:48,780
Death was certain

714
01:43:48,984 --> 01:43:55,480
My plane turned into a fireball.
l don't even know where l fell

715
01:43:55,657 --> 01:43:59,684
For 2 years l was neither
dead nor alive

716
01:44:00,062 --> 01:44:07,628
Dead...?
- Yes. Head injury. l lost my memory

717
01:44:09,004 --> 01:44:09,993
l couldn't remember a thing

718
01:44:11,773 --> 01:44:14,708
l was moved from one hospital
to another

719
01:44:15,744 --> 01:44:18,872
Do you know the first word l spoke
when l came around?

720
01:44:19,915 --> 01:44:22,042
''Your name Radha, your name''

721
01:44:22,918 --> 01:44:25,409
Only your name stood between
me and my death

722
01:44:26,455 --> 01:44:30,391
A drowning man will clutch at
anything. l clung on to your name

723
01:44:30,592 --> 01:44:33,561
''When l was sinking, drowning''
in the dark abyss of death...

724
01:44:33,762 --> 01:44:35,662
l clung to your name...
your memories

725
01:44:38,533 --> 01:44:39,727
Do you know what saved me ?

726
01:44:41,703 --> 01:44:44,171
What ?
- Your letter

727
01:44:44,406 --> 01:44:48,069
My letter ? But l didn't ...
- Have you forgotten ?

728
01:44:49,111 --> 01:44:50,237
You gave me the letter and
you asked me to post it

729
01:45:08,363 --> 01:45:10,593
l read the letter
over and over again

730
01:45:10,799 --> 01:45:13,165
l usually keep my wallet inside
my right pocket

731
01:45:13,402 --> 01:45:16,394
But your letter was in the wallet.
So l kept in in my left pocket...

732
01:45:16,571 --> 01:45:23,409
close to my heart. lt's as if
my death bounced off your letter

733
01:45:24,446 --> 01:45:27,847
'' Believe me Radha, l've crossed''
the river of no return...

734
01:45:28,016 --> 01:45:32,612
to come back to you.
