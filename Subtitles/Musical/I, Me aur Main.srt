does this plane belong to?

00:03:13,017 --> 00:03:15,679

00:03:17,588 --> 00:03:19,613
Shivani, why are you
hitting lshaan? Let go.

00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,022
Let go. Why are you hitting him?

But Mom, l made it. lshaan purposely..

11
00:03:23,761 --> 00:03:26,389
My child, you
shouldn't snitch while playing.

12
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,625
Go inside.
- But Mom..

13
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,997
No ifs or buts. Go.

14
00:03:30,034 --> 00:03:31,058
Go.

15
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:34,736
Did your sister hit you?

16
00:03:36,807 --> 00:03:38,069
You are strong.

17
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:39,640
lt doesn't hurt you.

18
00:03:40,077 --> 00:03:42,705
You are the best. Tell me..

19
00:03:43,581 --> 00:03:44,809

''Learn something l said.''

''Use your brains.''

00:04:47,545 --> 00:04:49,035
''Don't imitate me.''

31
00:04:49,313 --> 00:04:52,578
''There can be no one like me.''

32
00:04:52,984 --> 00:04:54,451
''With cappuccino..''

33
00:04:54,485 --> 00:04:56,320

''You'll get everything.''

37
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:05,395
''lf you don't, be patient.''

38
00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:07,920

''l like myself.''

43
00:05:25,816 --> 00:05:28,944
''This is how big a

00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:33,290
''But overall, it's good.''

''lt keeps looking
for beauty everywhere.''

47
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,656
''Take it easy.''

48
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:43,631
''lf your heart misbehaves, control it.''

49
00:05:44,402 --> 00:05:47,599
''lt's a little moody, a little cheesy.''

50
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,435
''Why mention your worries.''

''l, me and myself.''

''lf you don't live for yourself..''

56
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,674
''Then life is a punishment.''

57
00:06:30,481 --> 00:06:33,348
''Journey is always
better than the destination.''

58
00:06:33,384 --> 00:06:35,909
''Enjoy it.''

59
00:06:37,755 --> 00:06:43,352
''Wins the world, the one who believes..''

60
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:51,593
''There can never be
anyone better than oneself.''

61
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:53,527
''With cappuccino..''

62
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:54,799
''Oh, damsels..''

''l serve you my heart.''

''She wants my heart..''

65
00:07:01,312 --> 00:07:04,440
''Over the internet, SMS or phone.''

66
00:07:04,482 --> 00:07:06,973
''Be generous with your heart.''

67
00:07:11,422 --> 00:07:12,480
lshaan..

l love me, too.

71
00:07:21,832 --> 00:07:25,268
You are such an idiot.
- A sexy idiot.

72
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:27,734
My idiot.

73
00:07:35,513 --> 00:07:37,281
All the contracts are ready, right?

74
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:39,408

over each one of them.

75

Yes.

76
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,684
Hmm.

77
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:48,283
And the documents from the
Bangalore office? Yeah. Okay.

78
00:07:48,425 --> 00:07:49,858
Hi.
- Just a second.

79
00:07:49,994 --> 00:07:51,757
lshaan, where is your wallet?

80
00:07:52,696 --> 00:07:53,754
Milkman's dues.

81
00:07:54,632 --> 00:07:55,621
Why should l pay him?

82
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,932
l don't even drink milk.

83
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,460
ln fact, l even have my coffee black.

84
00:08:01,906 --> 00:08:03,237
Listen, l'll just call you back.

85
00:08:03,674 --> 00:08:05,005
lshaan, please.

86
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:06,541
l mean it.

87
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:09,002
How can you be so cheap?

88
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,448
l make your breakfast everyday.

89
00:08:11,482 --> 00:08:13,712
And your black coffee
as well, by the way.

90
00:08:14,318 --> 00:08:16,650
Sweetheart, l am so good that..

91
00:08:16,921 --> 00:08:20,618
..not just you, any girl l
know would do anything for me.

92
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:22,592
Bye.

93
00:08:23,861 --> 00:08:24,759
Sir.

94
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,562
Sister-in-law, shall l come tomorrow?.

95
00:08:30,601 --> 00:08:32,796
What sister-in-law?.!
Which sister-in-law?.!

96
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,771
l am no one's sister-in-law, okay?

97
00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:36,303
Sister-in-law!

98
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,804
Hi, Sweetheart.
- Good morning, sir.

99
00:08:53,691 --> 00:08:55,921
Good morning, sir.
- Hi. - Your bag? - Good morning.

100
00:08:58,295 --> 00:08:58,929
ls she in?

101
00:08:58,929 --> 00:08:59,987
Yeah, she is just waiting.

102
00:09:00,297 --> 00:09:01,764
Good. Good. Good.

103
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:06,962
Hey Beena.

104
00:09:07,605 --> 00:09:08,469
What's up?

105
00:09:10,975 --> 00:09:14,934
Come on, lshaan. This is no
time to walk in. You are late.

106
00:09:15,246 --> 00:09:16,304
Of course not.

107
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,381
Our meeting is scheduled for
10:30am and its only 10:15am.

108
00:09:19,984 --> 00:09:21,252
Oh, one second.

109
00:09:21,252 --> 00:09:23,516
You don't have the
confidence to work without me.

110
00:09:23,888 --> 00:09:27,255
Anyway, this is a music company
and not a multinational bank..

111
00:09:27,491 --> 00:09:29,391
..where l've to land up
early in the mornings.

112
00:09:29,426 --> 00:09:30,290
Okay?

113
00:09:30,327 --> 00:09:31,692
So, don't even expect that.

114
00:09:31,729 --> 00:09:34,254
l don't expect anything from you.

115
00:09:34,331 --> 00:09:35,730
You are not worthy of it.

116
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:38,865
Look, in spite of you being with them..

117
00:09:38,969 --> 00:09:44,874
..this company has hired me on a
higher salary with more perks.

118
00:09:45,576 --> 00:09:47,737
So that l can put you in your place.

119
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,812
A fair chance has to be given, right?

120
00:09:50,814 --> 00:09:52,748
Can you just help me with this, please?

121
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:08,328
lshaan, the sooner you know
your position, the better.

122
00:10:13,837 --> 00:10:18,365
Look baby, without me this
company's and your state..

123
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:21,701
..will be same as a ship without a
captain in the middle of the sea.

124
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,313
You'll be caught seesawing like this.

125
00:10:24,715 --> 00:10:26,317
With a SOS board around your neck.

126
00:10:26,317 --> 00:10:27,306
You understand?

127
00:10:27,785 --> 00:10:29,309
We'll see.

128
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,513
And what shit are we
listening to, today?

129
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:37,051
What's in store for
today's crappy audition list?

130
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:39,328
Here are some photographs.

131
00:10:39,396 --> 00:10:40,420
Like this one.

132
00:10:40,597 --> 00:10:42,565
She can modulate
really well and l like..

133
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:44,897
We aren't looking for a
model for a fairness cream.

134
00:10:46,003 --> 00:10:47,698
Auditions, please.

135
00:10:50,741 --> 00:10:52,003
And do you know what he told me?

136
00:10:52,343 --> 00:10:54,811
''Why should l pay him? ln fact,
l even have my coffee black.''

137
00:10:55,746 --> 00:10:56,804
Can you believe it?

138
00:10:56,981 --> 00:10:58,346
''l even have my coffee black.''

139
00:10:58,782 --> 00:11:01,910
l was like.. - Just leave him,
Anushka. You deserve much better.

140
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:11,056
Yeah, l know. Sometimes
l really feel l should..

141
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,724
But l love him.

142
00:11:16,633 --> 00:11:17,827
Oh he's..

143
00:11:17,868 --> 00:11:19,733
Fine then, suffer.

144
00:11:21,372 --> 00:11:25,832
Anyway, hows aunt? l
haven't met her since ages.

145
00:11:26,043 --> 00:11:27,032
She's good.

146
00:11:27,444 --> 00:11:29,412
l'm going to Pune
next week. Come with me.

147
00:11:30,714 --> 00:11:31,544
No.

148
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:33,607
l'll go with lshaan.

149
00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:37,614
To talk about our marriage..

150
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:40,321
Just grow up, girl!

151
00:11:40,557 --> 00:11:42,650
Shivs. Come on.

152
00:11:42,926 --> 00:11:44,723
How can you be so negative about him?

153
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:45,961
You are his sister.

154
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,396
l know him well because l am his sister.

155
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:50,326
And l am not negative.

156
00:11:51,402 --> 00:11:54,769
All l know is that he is not
at all prepared for marriage.

157
00:11:55,372 --> 00:11:58,364
You know Shivani, all
guys are commitment phobic.

158
00:11:58,575 --> 00:11:59,507
All of them.

159
00:11:59,543 --> 00:12:02,876
But after marriage
everything figures itself out.

160
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:05,538
And.. lshaan too will change.

161
00:12:08,652 --> 00:12:09,880
Hey, nice bag.

162
00:12:11,455 --> 00:12:12,513
Beautiful.

163
00:12:12,956 --> 00:12:15,288
Really?
- Yeah. - Me or the bag?

164
00:12:21,331 --> 00:12:21,990
l spoke about you yesterday..

165
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,001
l don't know whether the
song matches her style.

166
00:12:24,001 --> 00:12:25,400
Excuse me.
- But technically she is brilliant.

167
00:12:25,436 --> 00:12:26,801
Hey, lshaan's got a lovely house. Yeah?

168
00:12:26,837 --> 00:12:27,769
Hey, Anushka.

169
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,801
Hey. What's happening?

170
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,775
lshaan's office party.
- Where's lshaan?

171
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,801
He probably..

172
00:12:35,312 --> 00:12:36,438
He went to the bedroom.

173
00:12:37,581 --> 00:12:38,843
Bedroom?
- Yeah.

174
00:12:38,882 --> 00:12:39,746
Okay.

175
00:12:42,719 --> 00:12:43,743
Don't worry.

176
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:46,312
Come on. lt's coming.

177
00:12:46,356 --> 00:12:47,755
lt's coming. Just relax.
Relax. Relax. Relax. - lshaan..

178
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,487
Relax. Relax. Relax.
- lshaan?

179
00:12:51,028 --> 00:12:54,327
Better? Yeah? lt's there? Yeah. Yeah.

180
00:12:58,769 --> 00:12:59,667
Stinks.

181
00:13:00,871 --> 00:13:01,963

Are you throwing me out of the car?

Because this is my flat.

And you're not welcome here anymore.

252
00:17:33,643 --> 00:17:34,473

For coming home late.

263
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:23,020
For making you wait.

264
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,386
For not going to Pune.

265
00:18:25,829 --> 00:18:27,387
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

266
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:29,756

267
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,665
l should've sent you a message.

268
00:18:31,868 --> 00:18:32,835
You..

269
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,502
You are so kind,

270
00:18:34,538 --> 00:18:36,369
so loving, so patient..

271
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,529
You are so beautiful.

272
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,509
You're so full of shit.

273
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:44,913
Anushka, the thing is l

274
00:18:44,948 --> 00:18:46,472

00:18:47,317 --> 00:18:49,581
l was.. l was so disturbed, you know.

276
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:50,711
And one thing more.

277
00:18:50,821 --> 00:18:52,982
l kept thinking about us.

278
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,687
Can l come in and

279
00:18:54,724 --> 00:18:55,691

280
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,291
Please, baby?

281
00:18:57,394 --> 00:18:59,296
Then we can relax and talk.

282
00:18:59,296 --> 00:19:01,355
As long as you want. No?

283
00:19:01,398 --> 00:19:02,865
l can't do this anymore, lshaan.

284
00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:04,466
What can you not do?
- l..

285
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:06,298
You can't make coffee? l'll make it.

286
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,869
You'll never change.

287
00:19:09,372 --> 00:19:10,862
This is all ajoke to you?

288
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:14,400
But this isn't ajoke to me, lshaan.

289
00:19:15,846 --> 00:19:17,507
This is my life.

290
00:19:19,349 --> 00:19:20,509
What is wrong if l..

291
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,881
..want someone to be with me?

292
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,319
Someone who wants to talk
to me about my feelings.

293
00:19:27,257 --> 00:19:30,283
And perhaps someday make a life with me.

294
00:19:31,027 --> 00:19:33,552
What's wrong with it, lshaan?

295
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,398
Tell me. l..

296
00:19:36,533 --> 00:19:38,933
l can't deal with this anymore.

297
00:19:39,603 --> 00:19:41,537

298
00:19:42,706 --> 00:19:43,604
Please don't cry.

l'm not crying, you idiot!

300
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:01,279
Who's the best? Who's the best?

301
00:20:06,363 --> 00:20:07,557

Good morning, ma'am.

Beena.

304
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:23,605
Beena..

305
00:20:25,749 --> 00:20:26,716
You know Sukanya?

306
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,081
Hi.

307
00:20:30,353 --> 00:20:32,014
Hi.

308
00:20:32,422 --> 00:20:34,014
The most promising voice.

Sing.

310
00:20:38,328 --> 00:20:39,317
Here?

311
00:20:39,563 --> 00:20:40,461
Hmm.

312
00:20:44,634 --> 00:20:46,761
''My name is Sheila.''

313
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,395
''Sheila's youth..''

314
00:20:49,573 --> 00:20:51,939
''l'm too sexy for you.''

315
00:20:52,108 --> 00:20:54,804
''You can't get me.''

316
00:20:54,844 --> 00:20:57,347
''No. No. No. Sheila.''

317
00:20:57,347 --> 00:20:59,747
''Sheila's youth..''

318
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,475
''l'm too..''
- Can you sing the happy birthday song?

319
00:21:01,818 --> 00:21:02,716
Yes.

320
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:03,783
Sing.

321
00:21:06,923 --> 00:21:11,485
''Happy birthday to you.''

322
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:15,831
''Happy birthday to you.''

323
00:21:15,932 --> 00:21:19,561
''Happy birthday to you.''
- Like a 5 year old?

324
00:21:24,007 --> 00:21:28,307
''Happy birthday to you.''

325
00:21:28,411 --> 00:21:32,575
''Happy birthday to you.''

326
00:21:32,782 --> 00:21:34,977
''Happy birthday..''
- That's enough.

327
00:21:35,018 --> 00:21:37,077
''Happy birthday.''

328
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,685
''Happy birthday to you.''

329
00:21:41,691 --> 00:21:43,852
What was that?
- Auditions.

330
00:21:44,461 --> 00:21:46,088
You know my dog Bugsy?

331
00:21:46,463 --> 00:21:47,862
lt's his fifth birthday.

332
00:21:47,897 --> 00:21:49,660
And he loves live pertormances.

333
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:51,360
You are insulting a talent, Beena.

334
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:52,891
For a dog's birthday party?

335
00:21:53,637 --> 00:21:56,401
l'm giving your ''Find'' a chance.

336
00:21:56,539 --> 00:21:57,938
lt's going to be a big party.

337
00:21:57,974 --> 00:21:58,941
A lot of dogs with be there..

338
00:21:58,975 --> 00:22:00,340
To wag their tails.

339
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:04,611
And yes, you addressed me as ''baby''.

340
00:22:05,415 --> 00:22:06,882
l can sue you for that.

341
00:22:07,283 --> 00:22:08,011
Just saying.

342
00:22:11,287 --> 00:22:11,946
What!

343
00:22:14,924 --> 00:22:16,687
Hey, Rishi, give me. Give it to me.

344
00:22:18,495 --> 00:22:19,393
Mom's here.

345
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,497
Good that Anushka dumped you.

346
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,493
Rishi, if you are done eating, you
can go inside and wash your hands.

347
00:22:27,537 --> 00:22:29,767
You are done.
- Okay, Mom.

348
00:22:32,308 --> 00:22:35,539
Shivani, you know, you have
started behaving just like mom.

349
00:22:35,578 --> 00:22:36,442
And have started
looking like her as well.

350
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:37,639
Absolutely. Ditto copy.

351
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,379
Actually, it's my fault that
l introduced you to Anushka.

352
00:22:45,321 --> 00:22:47,448
l lost our friendship
because of your deeds.

353
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:48,646
Deeds?!

354
00:22:51,561 --> 00:22:52,550
You know..

355
00:22:53,363 --> 00:22:55,456
Anushka deserves much better.

356
00:22:56,332 --> 00:22:59,927
Someone who is a grown up and
doesn't pass okra under the table.

357
00:23:02,906 --> 00:23:05,636
Shall l remind you that you
stopped your law practice five years ago?

358
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,469
And what do you do?

359
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,637
You fill this world with cheap music.

360
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:12,040
Wow lshaan, so impressive.

361
00:23:12,282 --> 00:23:12,976
How d..

362
00:23:14,884 --> 00:23:17,546
And anyway, Anushka didn't dump me.

363
00:23:17,787 --> 00:23:19,277
lt's just a small misunderstanding.

364
00:23:19,456 --> 00:23:20,354
That's all.

365
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,640
She changed the lock.

366
00:23:39,609 --> 00:23:40,769
You changed the lock!

367
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:41,674
How d..

368
00:23:47,784 --> 00:23:49,649
Did you call Anushka?

369
00:23:51,321 --> 00:23:52,515
She changed the lock, man.

370
00:23:52,555 --> 00:23:53,647
Oh really?

371
00:23:57,327 --> 00:23:58,487
Do you love her?

372
00:23:58,528 --> 00:23:59,495
Huh?

373
00:23:59,629 --> 00:24:00,789
Oh, shit!

374
00:24:01,698 --> 00:24:03,359
l was on level 5. Did
you see what you just did?

375
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:06,266
lshaan, Do. You. Love. Her?

376
00:24:06,703 --> 00:24:07,965
We looked good together.

377
00:24:08,371 --> 00:24:09,565
We were good together.

378
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:11,739
l wonder why she
wants to ruin everything.

379
00:24:11,775 --> 00:24:13,402
She wants to ruin it?

380
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,275
Have you seen the condition l'm in?

381
00:24:15,945 --> 00:24:17,344
l'm on your sofa.

382
00:24:17,814 --> 00:24:18,746
l don't have a toothbrush.

383
00:24:18,782 --> 00:24:19,976
Pizza's over.

384
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:21,781
And your beer isn't cold either.

385
00:24:21,818 --> 00:24:23,911
lshaan, this situation
is a little serious.

386
00:24:23,953 --> 00:24:27,320
You'll have to reverse it.
And this is what you do.

387
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,685
This is what you are
good at. Come on, man.

388
00:24:29,726 --> 00:24:31,353
You'll have to do something.

389
00:24:47,443 --> 00:24:49,638
Hey Anushka, it's me, Tarun.

390
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:50,976
Please open the door.

391
00:24:56,052 --> 00:24:58,543
l called. You didn't answer it.

392
00:25:05,829 --> 00:25:10,960
Shoes. Shoes. Clothes.
Clothes. DVDs. Protein powders.

393
00:25:11,501 --> 00:25:14,959
And your 42 inch life
support system is also packed.

394
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:16,965
And my lazy boy?

395
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,797
That is all that belongs to you, right?

396
00:25:18,942 --> 00:25:21,001
Take it. l hate it anyway.

397
00:25:21,477 --> 00:25:22,637
Okay?

398
00:25:33,356 --> 00:25:34,414
Keep it.

399
00:25:42,365 --> 00:25:43,957
So sir, are you staying
alone for the first time?

400
00:25:44,734 --> 00:25:45,894
Total freedom.

401
00:25:46,569 --> 00:25:48,730
No one to nag you. No one to talk to.

402
00:25:48,771 --> 00:25:51,831
So l'll get the agreement
ready and send it to your office.

403
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:53,672
Okay? Bye.

404
00:26:06,489 --> 00:26:07,456
Who's the best? Who's the best.

405
00:26:07,824 --> 00:26:09,416
lshaan! lshaan! lshaan!

406
00:26:12,662 --> 00:26:13,560
So..

407
00:26:15,932 --> 00:26:17,399
You are my new neighbor.

408
00:26:26,976 --> 00:26:28,534
lshaan Sabharwal.

409
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,974
Music producer. CMC records.

410
00:26:31,814 --> 00:26:32,803
Gauri Dandekar.

411
00:26:32,849 --> 00:26:35,409
Stylist and.. part time electrician.

412
00:26:35,618 --> 00:26:36,983
Part time electrician?

413
00:26:37,654 --> 00:26:39,986
Yeah. The wiring of
this building is bad.

414
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,554
lf fuse ever blows out,
don't hesitate to call me.

415
00:26:43,026 --> 00:26:45,392
Don't worry. l won't charge you.

416
00:26:45,728 --> 00:26:47,889
lt's not my profession. lt's my passion.

417
00:26:49,966 --> 00:26:51,058
Oh hey..

418
00:26:51,501 --> 00:26:52,798
Welcome to the building.

419
00:26:55,939 --> 00:26:56,803
What is this for?

420
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:59,431
Keeps the noise out.

421
00:27:06,282 --> 00:27:09,774
Are you going to make me do a
lifetime's exercise in a day?

422
00:27:09,819 --> 00:27:11,582
This problem is being caused by Anushka.

423
00:27:11,621 --> 00:27:13,851
That movie is out of the theatre, boss.

424
00:27:14,524 --> 00:27:17,254
Yes. Because l've
shut down that theatre.

425
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,019
How long should l run after her?

426
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:27,535
By the way, Your neighbor,
what's her name?

427
00:27:27,637 --> 00:27:30,003
Gauri.
- Yes. Hows she?

428
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,568
She's average.

429
00:27:31,607 --> 00:27:34,735
Oh really? - Yes. - Then
what are those earplugs for?

430
00:27:35,011 --> 00:27:37,411
l don't know. She must be
doing acrobatics at night.

431
00:27:38,348 --> 00:27:39,542
Who cares?

432
00:27:55,365 --> 00:27:56,354
What the..

433
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,294
Hello! What's happening?

434
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,307
Hello! Can't you hear me?

435
00:28:08,011 --> 00:28:09,672
Hey, l'm asking you guys.

436
00:28:10,346 --> 00:28:11,540
What are you guys doing?

437
00:28:11,848 --> 00:28:13,247
What's happening?

438
00:28:14,951 --> 00:28:16,851
They can't hear you.

439
00:28:16,886 --> 00:28:17,853
Simple physics.

440
00:28:17,887 --> 00:28:20,947
That drill's volume is
much louder than your voice.

441
00:28:22,258 --> 00:28:23,282
What the..

442
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:29,362
Hey! Whoa! Where are you going?

443
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:30,593
Are you going to stop them?

444
00:28:30,633 --> 00:28:31,827
What's so funny?

445
00:28:32,268 --> 00:28:33,360
Nothing.

446
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,993
You know this is the
problem with people.

447
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:38,269
l mean when these guys don't work,
people cause a commotion.

448
00:28:38,541 --> 00:28:41,635
And when these guys work,
people aren't happy.

449
00:28:41,911 --> 00:28:44,971
Come on, it's not like they
enjoy working all night long.

450
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,914
They are not partying, right?

451
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,442
That's not my problem.

452
00:28:49,585 --> 00:28:51,382
What an attitude!

453
00:28:51,487 --> 00:28:52,681
''lt's not my problem.''

454
00:28:53,322 --> 00:28:56,052
lf l knew the broker was going
to get such a grumpy neighbor..

455
00:28:56,392 --> 00:28:57,825
..then l would have shifted out of here.

456
00:28:58,995 --> 00:29:00,587
You called me grumpy?

457
00:29:01,464 --> 00:29:02,556
You called me grumpy?

458
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:08,333
There's no one else here
other than me and you.

459
00:29:08,704 --> 00:29:11,673
So it's obvious, isn't it,
that l called you grumpy.

460
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:14,001
Don't worry.

461
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,972
l'm going to call you all
kinds of things in the future.

462
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:22,541
And you know what, slowly
you'll start to like my blabbering.

463
00:29:22,785 --> 00:29:26,744
Like, right now, l'm blabbering..

464
00:29:26,856 --> 00:29:29,791
..and you can't even
hear the noise outside.

465
00:29:32,862 --> 00:29:36,354
You know what, just use
the earplugs and go to sleep.

466
00:29:38,367 --> 00:29:40,665
Oh, by the way..

467
00:29:41,037 --> 00:29:42,561
Nice boxers.

468
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,477
Yeah?

469
00:30:01,457 --> 00:30:02,389
lshu..

470
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:03,687
How are you?

471
00:30:04,327 --> 00:30:04,986
l hope you're fine.

472
00:30:05,027 --> 00:30:05,959
Mom? What are you doing here?

473
00:30:05,995 --> 00:30:07,895
Your sister told your dad everything.

474
00:30:08,064 --> 00:30:09,998
He even came to know about Anushka.

475
00:30:10,032 --> 00:30:11,522
No one tells me anything.

476
00:30:11,567 --> 00:30:13,728
But good that you left that girl.

477
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:15,498
l never liked her.

478
00:30:16,038 --> 00:30:18,836
What's wrong, lshu? You look unwell.

479
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:19,864
l hope you are feeling fine.

480
00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:20,967
Mom, l..
- Yes?

481
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:23,742
Don't worry. Now that l'm here,
everything will be fine.

482
00:30:23,913 --> 00:30:25,312
Come on, move aside now.

483
00:30:25,781 --> 00:30:26,645
Mom..

484
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,317
Your dad must be up by now.

485
00:30:31,554 --> 00:30:32,919
He must be wondering where l am.

486
00:30:33,322 --> 00:30:34,380
You didn't tell dad?

487
00:30:34,423 --> 00:30:35,856
Your favorite bread.

488
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,727
Mom, you got this plate
and cup from home, from Pune?

489
00:30:40,763 --> 00:30:44,529
Then what. l got all the
plates and cutlery with me.

490
00:30:45,735 --> 00:30:48,363
lshu, what's this? There's no water.

491
00:30:48,871 --> 00:30:50,429
ls this building like
those places where..

492
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:52,031
..there is water only
at a particular time.

493
00:30:52,341 --> 00:30:54,070
Oh, no. l should've
brought a bucket as well.

494
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,873
Kitchenware is available in Mumbai.

495
00:30:55,912 --> 00:30:56,936
You know that, don't you?

496
00:30:56,979 --> 00:30:58,105
At double the cost.

497
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,881
Anyway your dad is
staying alone in Pune.

498
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,874
How many plates will he use?

499
00:31:03,286 --> 00:31:06,881
lf he could have his way, he would
never let me out of the kitchen.

500
00:31:06,923 --> 00:31:08,356
After all, l'm just his servant.

501
00:31:08,391 --> 00:31:09,722
Mom, what are you saying?

502
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:10,623
Think before you speak.

503
00:31:10,826 --> 00:31:12,555
Ever since your dad has retired..

504
00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:14,624
..he has made my life miserable.

505
00:31:14,897 --> 00:31:16,831
lt's either a pain in the
head or a pain in the neck.

506
00:31:17,033 --> 00:31:19,695
Sometimes he wants to have
fritters and sometimes it's porridge.

507
00:31:19,735 --> 00:31:22,602
lf your dad can retire
then why can't l? - Mom..

508
00:31:22,838 --> 00:31:24,328
Let your dad go to hell.

509
00:31:24,373 --> 00:31:25,533
Now l'm not going to move from here.

510
00:31:25,575 --> 00:31:26,906
From where?

511
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,599
From here.

512
00:31:28,644 --> 00:31:30,313
From Mumbai. From your flat.

513
00:31:30,313 --> 00:31:32,474
And dad?
- l've left him.

514
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:33,447
What!

515
00:31:33,816 --> 00:31:35,374
Oh no! What have you done!

516
00:31:35,651 --> 00:31:36,982
You dropped everything.

517
00:31:38,721 --> 00:31:41,713
See, the melamine plates
we get in Pune are so good!

518
00:31:41,891 --> 00:31:42,949
Unbreakable.

519
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:51,388
Look, lshu, you are all grown up now.

520
00:31:51,767 --> 00:31:52,995
You can understand.

521
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:56,465
l will not go back to your dad in Pune.

522
00:31:56,872 --> 00:31:59,033
l'll stay here, with you.

523
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,759
So you can sing.

524
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,832
Anything else?

525
00:32:28,971 --> 00:32:30,802
Excuse me?

526
00:32:33,442 --> 00:32:36,309
Fashion sense. Style. Sex appeal.

527
00:32:36,512 --> 00:32:38,503
All these are necessary
to become a hit singer.

528
00:32:39,915 --> 00:32:40,939
Right?

529
00:32:41,617 --> 00:32:43,551
l'm just a singer.

530
00:32:43,986 --> 00:32:45,578
l don't know anything else.

531
00:32:46,322 --> 00:32:47,721
l don't understand.

532
00:32:51,794 --> 00:32:53,056
Shona.

533
00:32:53,963 --> 00:32:54,930
Yes.

534
00:32:54,964 --> 00:32:56,363
Big star.

535
00:32:56,732 --> 00:32:57,596
l know.

536
00:32:57,633 --> 00:32:58,998
Do you listen to her music?

537
00:32:59,702 --> 00:33:01,636
Yes.
- She also didn't know anything before.

538
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,829
l made her a big star.

539
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,800
Do you know how?.

540
00:33:10,012 --> 00:33:16,349
Amala, do you want to see
your poster in a music store?

541
00:33:18,321 --> 00:33:20,653
Your billboard at every crossing?

542
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:23,355
Do you want people to buy your music?

543
00:33:25,494 --> 00:33:26,324
Yes.

544
00:33:26,362 --> 00:33:28,830
Good. Then from now on, stop thinking.

545
00:33:30,032 --> 00:33:31,465
l'll do the thinking for you.

546
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,529
Are you with me?

547
00:33:35,671 --> 00:33:36,968
Are you with me?

548
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,034
Yes.

549
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:41,842
Yes.

550
00:33:41,877 --> 00:33:42,844
Good.

551
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,410
Sir..

552
00:33:45,715 --> 00:33:47,444
Keep it. lt's yours.

553
00:33:56,592 --> 00:34:00,790
Farhad. What is this ''Save the
tiger'' donkey doing with Anushka?

554
00:34:00,863 --> 00:34:03,832
Agastya? He came with her.

555
00:34:05,267 --> 00:34:06,325
You okay?

556
00:34:06,369 --> 00:34:07,269
Yeah.

557
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:09,464
Last week he caught four
tiger poachers, all by himself.

558
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:10,934
lndian Rambo, man.

559
00:34:11,407 --> 00:34:12,305
Too good.

560
00:34:12,475 --> 00:34:14,841
Here, have a drink.
- Thanks.

561
00:34:15,277 --> 00:34:16,676
lt will ease the heartache.

562
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:19,378
Cheers.

563
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,382
Bastard. He's
encroaching on my territory.

564
00:34:27,423 --> 00:34:29,516
Last week you said that
it's all over for you.

565
00:34:29,558 --> 00:34:30,684
And now you are feeling jealous.

566
00:34:30,726 --> 00:34:31,750
Don't think.

567
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,556
Anyway you are not used to it.

568
00:34:33,596 --> 00:34:35,689
l'm going there. Hold this.
- lshaan.

569
00:34:35,965 --> 00:34:37,694
Forget it. lshaan.

570
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,028
Really, l swear.

571
00:34:40,936 --> 00:34:42,301
Hi, lshaan.

572
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,835
You remember Agastya, right?

573
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,569
Can l talk to you?
- Yeah.

574
00:34:51,747 --> 00:34:53,612
lshaan..
- What is Agastya doing here?

575
00:34:54,417 --> 00:34:56,715
l thought you are
through with the tiger project.

576
00:34:56,986 --> 00:34:59,546
Look, l volunteer with his organization.

577
00:34:59,588 --> 00:35:00,782
And l do legal work. You know that.

578
00:35:00,823 --> 00:35:04,657
Since when? What else? Have you
turn into a vegetarian as well?

579
00:35:06,295 --> 00:35:07,489
Actually, yes.

580
00:35:09,365 --> 00:35:11,765
You inviting him for my
friend's party, what does that mean?

581
00:35:11,801 --> 00:35:13,860
Look, Farhad is also my friend, lshaan.

582
00:35:14,003 --> 00:35:15,800
And l don't mean anything by it.

583
00:35:16,005 --> 00:35:18,274
l mean l was going to a
party to l brought him with me.

584
00:35:18,274 --> 00:35:19,298
That's all. Just a friend.

585
00:35:19,341 --> 00:35:20,000
Friend?

586
00:35:20,276 --> 00:35:23,507
Really? Miss. Meerut? That's so modern.

587
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,005
So how does he pertorm?

588
00:35:26,348 --> 00:35:27,975
Better than me?

589
00:35:28,884 --> 00:35:30,545
l can't talk to you.

590
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:31,712
You are such a child!

591
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:37,058
Anushka, shall we?

592
00:35:38,461 --> 00:35:39,951
Yeah, l think l'm done here.

593
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:41,654
Let's go.

594
00:35:55,344 --> 00:35:56,436
What are we doing here?

595
00:35:57,313 --> 00:35:59,042
We are men, Tarun. Men.

596
00:35:59,648 --> 00:36:01,350
We are marking our territory.

597
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,282
Oh really?

598
00:36:02,585 --> 00:36:03,916
Even dogs do that, don't they?

599
00:36:04,253 --> 00:36:06,778
They pee under a tree
and mark their territory.

600
00:36:07,256 --> 00:36:08,518
What a life l have!

601
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:11,485
Look! That lying..

602
00:36:11,527 --> 00:36:13,461
No, lshaan, let it be. Let's go.

603
00:36:53,469 --> 00:36:54,766
Be careful, dear.

604
00:36:57,306 --> 00:36:58,432
What's happening, Mom?

605
00:36:58,641 --> 00:37:00,836
lshu, you know that serial..

606
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,570
The serial, ''Stars and
the moon, for you''..

607
00:37:02,611 --> 00:37:05,273
''Dark nights for me''.
- Yes. - Today is its final episode.

608
00:37:05,314 --> 00:37:09,011
Yes, so l thought we'll have
a serial party in our house.

609
00:37:09,251 --> 00:37:10,479
l've even made 'Samosas' (snacks).

610
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,884
You didn't have a cable connection.

611
00:37:11,987 --> 00:37:14,251
Look at Gauri, she's
getting the cable down.

612
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,855
She is pulling a connection
from the junction, for me.

613
00:37:16,959 --> 00:37:18,756
Mom! Mom, what's wrong with you?

614
00:37:19,261 --> 00:37:20,455
You are stealing a cable connection!
- No! No! No!

615
00:37:20,496 --> 00:37:21,997
They will throw me out
of the flat in two days!

616
00:37:21,997 --> 00:37:23,760
l'm not stealing it,
son. lt's just for today.

617
00:37:25,334 --> 00:37:26,858
You don't have to do this.

618
00:37:27,903 --> 00:37:29,336
lt's okay.

619
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:33,372
No, it's not okay. Please..

620
00:37:35,511 --> 00:37:37,274
Gauri.
- Gauri.

621
00:37:40,783 --> 00:37:41,875
l'll handle it.

622
00:37:41,917 --> 00:37:43,384
Let men do the manly jobs.

623
00:37:43,485 --> 00:37:46,613
Okay.
- Okay, Mr. Man.

624
00:37:49,491 --> 00:37:51,789
Do you always yell at aunt
in this manner? - Sorry?

625
00:37:51,961 --> 00:37:54,759
Not to me, say it to aunt. ''Sorry.''

626
00:37:57,366 --> 00:37:59,834
Oh, by the way, l like your style.

627
00:37:59,969 --> 00:38:01,994
lt was a nice act,
you forgetting my name.

628
00:38:03,772 --> 00:38:06,969
''Mr. Man.'' ''The act
for forgetting my name.''

629
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:10,375
Early morning blabbering.

630
00:38:10,646 --> 00:38:11,908
Didn't even let me have coffee.

631
00:38:11,947 --> 00:38:13,642
Whose house is it, huh?

632
00:38:17,686 --> 00:38:18,914
Hello?

633
00:38:19,822 --> 00:38:22,757
Yes? Do you want something?

634
00:38:23,425 --> 00:38:25,757
The ladder. Sorry, l kept it inside.

635
00:38:26,662 --> 00:38:27,924
Should l get it? -The ladder?

636
00:38:28,731 --> 00:38:30,961
Please. What will l do with it?

637
00:38:31,634 --> 00:38:32,862
lt's hardly 10 feet.

638
00:38:32,968 --> 00:38:34,595
l jump from a height
of 10 feet every day.

639
00:38:36,038 --> 00:38:39,405
So, why did you call me?
- l brought the cable down.

640
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:41,805
Wow! Ten out of ten!

641
00:38:57,292 --> 00:38:58,691
What happened?
- Nothing.

642
00:39:02,398 --> 00:39:04,389
Ouch!

643
00:39:11,907 --> 00:39:14,467
''Move a little, shake a little.''

644
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,740
''Come into my arms.''

645
00:39:17,513 --> 00:39:22,314
''Don't you wanna know, what's
the secret hiding in my eyes?''

646
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:25,313
''What are you thinking about?''

647
00:39:31,894 --> 00:39:34,556
lshaan, change her track.

648
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,254
How will this poor girl sing this?

649
00:39:36,465 --> 00:39:37,557
lt's just not her.

650
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,862
l'll do something.

651
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,771
lshaan..

652
00:39:45,274 --> 00:39:46,036
Amala..

653
00:39:46,709 --> 00:39:47,937
Why are you so nervous?

654
00:39:47,976 --> 00:39:49,637
lshaan, l can't do it. Please.

655
00:39:49,778 --> 00:39:51,643
Amala, your voice is good.

656
00:39:51,814 --> 00:39:52,781
You just need to modulate a little.

657
00:39:52,815 --> 00:39:53,679
l can't do it.

658
00:39:53,716 --> 00:39:55,775
lshaan, l'm.. l'm just a flop..

659
00:39:56,418 --> 00:39:58,579
Listen, just imagine..

660
00:39:59,421 --> 00:40:00,945
That this is the only
chance you have to sing.

661
00:40:01,457 --> 00:40:04,517
You'll never get such a chance again.

662
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,554
This is your only chance.

663
00:40:07,629 --> 00:40:08,527
This is it.

664
00:40:08,731 --> 00:40:10,289
You got it? You will do it?

665
00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:12,391
Yes.
- Good. Go for it.

666
00:40:18,307 --> 00:40:20,298
Synthesize a little
and add some more beats.

667
00:40:20,976 --> 00:40:23,604
Then it will be same as the
song Shona sang last time.

668
00:40:23,645 --> 00:40:25,306
That ''Life..'' song.

669
00:40:28,817 --> 00:40:30,580
That was last year's best track.

670
00:40:30,986 --> 00:40:32,317
And l had cracked it.

671
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:35,922
That's true. Somehow your
decisions have always worked.

672
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,788
Fine then. Let's begin.

673
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,530
Awesome.
- Was it?

674
00:40:46,568 --> 00:40:48,399
Yes.
- Oh, my God.

675
00:40:48,704 --> 00:40:49,728
Yeah.

676
00:40:49,872 --> 00:40:51,464
Yes, Tarun.
- Who is this?

677
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,868
Behave yourself.

678
00:40:52,941 --> 00:40:53,737
Can you hear me?

679
00:40:53,776 --> 00:40:55,038
Hey!
- Hey! How are you?

680
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,578
Good to see you.
- That's for you.

681
00:40:56,578 --> 00:40:57,567
Thank you so much.

682
00:40:57,679 --> 00:40:59,442
Good. Yeah, everybody is inside.

683
00:40:59,481 --> 00:41:00,641
Oh, are they?
- Yeah. - Good.

684
00:41:00,682 --> 00:41:02,479
Hey! Hi!
- How are you? - How are you?

685
00:41:03,986 --> 00:41:05,613
Are you guarding the door?

686
00:41:06,455 --> 00:41:08,423
Join us, we don't bite.

687
00:41:08,457 --> 00:41:09,651
l mean all the time.

688
00:41:09,892 --> 00:41:11,416
Only sometimes.

689
00:41:13,395 --> 00:41:15,693
Guys. This is my neighbor, lshaan.

690
00:41:15,731 --> 00:41:17,631
Hi.
- Hi. - These are my friends Not again!

691
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:18,963
Make yourself comfortable.
- Yeah.

692
00:41:19,001 --> 00:41:21,435
Hey, Gauri. You got to hear this.
- Yeah?

693
00:41:21,703 --> 00:41:24,035
He just dated a random guy off the net.

694
00:41:24,072 --> 00:41:26,040
No way!
- Really.

695
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:35,007
That's aunt Sakina from the
fourth floor, when she was two.

696
00:41:35,517 --> 00:41:38,509
And l have cut all these
photographs from magazines.

697
00:41:38,821 --> 00:41:41,984
What?
- They are my photographs, stupid.

698
00:41:42,491 --> 00:41:44,049
Anyway. That's my dad.

699
00:41:44,092 --> 00:41:46,526
His rum chicken is to die for.

700
00:41:47,329 --> 00:41:48,819
Ex-boyfriend.

701
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,329
Another ex.

702
00:41:50,866 --> 00:41:53,460
And before you say anything, let me
tell you there were only two exes.

703
00:41:53,502 --> 00:41:54,730
So, shut up.
- Yeah!

704
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:56,032
That's my best friend.

705
00:41:56,605 --> 00:41:59,335
Whom l have not spoken to in ten years.

706
00:41:59,908 --> 00:42:00,875
My assistant.

707
00:42:00,909 --> 00:42:02,672
Gauri, your turn.

708
00:42:03,011 --> 00:42:05,002
Hold on. Coming. Come on.

709
00:42:05,447 --> 00:42:07,574
Come on, Gauri. Ready to lose?

710
00:42:08,784 --> 00:42:09,876
Hey, lshaan.

Hows it going?
- Good. Good. Good.

Drinks?
- No! No! No! - Whiskey on the rocks.

713
00:42:13,889 --> 00:42:14,947
Yeah!

714
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,758
Cheater! l won't play with you.

715
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,824
Third knockout!

716
00:42:18,894 --> 00:42:20,327
ls there anyone who can defeat me?

717
00:42:20,362 --> 00:42:22,523
There is. This handsome.

l don't play with girls.

719
00:42:24,566 --> 00:42:25,726
Why, Mr. Man?

720
00:42:28,036 --> 00:42:28,900
Oh really!

721
00:42:28,937 --> 00:42:31,997
Oh!

722
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,907
Come on.
- He's gone. Let's go.

723
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:36,374
Come on, Gauri.

724
00:42:36,411 --> 00:42:37,639
Come on. Come on, you can do it.

725
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:38,771
Oh, my God.

Come on, lshaan. Come on. Come on.

727
00:42:39,982 --> 00:42:42,007
Go for it, lshaan. Go. Go.

728
00:42:42,384 --> 00:42:44,784
Go! Go! Go!
- Oh God!

729
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,845
Hey, go for it. -Oh, no!
- That's it. Yes.

730
00:42:46,889 --> 00:42:48,948
You can do it.
- l am trying.

731
00:42:49,391 --> 00:42:50,790
Come on!
- Come on! - Oh God!

732
00:42:50,826 --> 00:42:51,952
Watch out! Come on!
- Go! Go, lshaan!

733
00:42:51,994 --> 00:42:52,983
Yes, lshaan! Go! Go! Go!

735
00:42:57,833 --> 00:42:58,993
lshaan! lshaan!

736
00:43:09,544 --> 00:43:13,503
She was cheating! Was cheating.
- Okay, time for dinner!

737
00:43:22,357 --> 00:43:24,291
Thank you so much for coming.
- Thank you.

738
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,884
Bye, loser.
- Cheater!

739
00:43:27,696 --> 00:43:29,664
Hey.
- So cheating, huh?

740
00:43:30,632 --> 00:43:31,826
l like to win.

741
00:43:31,867 --> 00:43:32,959
Rematch?
- Why?

742
00:43:33,001 --> 00:43:34,468
Want to get thrashed again?

743
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,435
Who's the best? Who's the best?

744
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:40,705
lt's Gauri. Gauri. Gauri.

745
00:43:41,843 --> 00:43:43,777
Good night. -Thanks for coming.

746
00:44:00,529 --> 00:44:01,894
So?

747
00:44:02,698 --> 00:44:03,960
What do you want to do?

748
00:44:06,335 --> 00:44:09,532
Agastya, you're my friend. You tell me.

749
00:44:10,906 --> 00:44:13,340
l can't understand anything.
l'm confused.

750
00:44:13,542 --> 00:44:16,010
Anushka, there's nothing to understand.

751
00:44:16,345 --> 00:44:17,369
Just tell him.

752
00:44:17,412 --> 00:44:18,674
Tell him.

753
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:20,339
l should tell him?

754
00:44:20,382 --> 00:44:21,576
Excuse me, sir.

755
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:25,480
Thank you.

756
00:44:26,321 --> 00:44:27,289
What should l tell him?

757
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:29,416
That, ''l know you
don't want to marry me.''

758
00:44:29,825 --> 00:44:32,055
''You don't want children.
But guess what?''

759
00:44:32,561 --> 00:44:33,994
''l'm pregnant.''

760
00:44:34,896 --> 00:44:37,490
''We are going to have a child.''

761
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:41,630
Anushka, you know that
he has a right to know.

762
00:44:42,371 --> 00:44:43,861
He has no right.

763
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:45,898
lt's over between us.

764
00:44:48,343 --> 00:44:51,437
He.. He doesn't even love me.

765
00:44:52,848 --> 00:44:56,511
Anushka, he deserves to know.

766
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,719
Tell him. Give him one last chance.

767
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:02,721
He does.

768
00:45:11,767 --> 00:45:13,291
Okay.

769
00:45:15,536 --> 00:45:17,766
Oh, my God. Anushka.

770
00:45:18,706 --> 00:45:21,607
Did you.. Did you tell lshaan?

771
00:45:22,744 --> 00:45:25,406
No. Not yet.

772
00:45:25,747 --> 00:45:27,248
You know him.

773
00:45:27,248 --> 00:45:28,772
l wonder how he will react.

774
00:45:28,816 --> 00:45:30,545
What do you mean by how will he react?

775
00:45:30,718 --> 00:45:33,380
lt's his child. He'll
have to act responsible.

776
00:45:33,755 --> 00:45:35,245
You must tell him.

777
00:45:40,461 --> 00:45:41,587
Careful, Ms. Beena.

778
00:45:42,664 --> 00:45:44,461
Fasten your seatbelt.

779
00:45:44,999 --> 00:45:48,594
Otherwise, chances are that what
you'll hear will blow you away.

780
00:45:50,271 --> 00:45:52,865
Wow. l'm really excited!

781
00:45:54,309 --> 00:45:55,298
Clap. Clap.

782
00:45:55,777 --> 00:45:56,766
Amala.

783
00:45:57,779 --> 00:46:00,680
''Look at the way l move my body.''

784
00:46:00,715 --> 00:46:02,740
''Look at the way l groove.''

785
00:46:03,418 --> 00:46:04,851
''This is intoxicating.''

786
00:46:04,886 --> 00:46:08,720
''ln this inebriety,
everybody let your body loose.''

787
00:46:08,756 --> 00:46:11,589
''Move a little, shake a little.''

788
00:46:11,626 --> 00:46:13,821
''Come into my arms.''

789
00:46:14,395 --> 00:46:19,355
''Don't you wanna know, what's
the secret hiding in my eyes?''

790
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,333
''What are you thinking about?''

791
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:24,361
''Expunge this distance.''

792
00:46:25,006 --> 00:46:27,236
''Don't let this night go waste.''

793
00:46:27,375 --> 00:46:30,469
''Don't lose this moment.''

794
00:46:31,346 --> 00:46:34,282
''Look at the way l move my body.''

795
00:46:34,282 --> 00:46:36,341
''Look at the way l groove.''

796
00:46:36,751 --> 00:46:38,480
''This is intoxicating.''

797
00:46:41,689 --> 00:46:43,714
l don't think she has a promising voice.

798
00:46:53,668 --> 00:46:54,566
So?

799
00:46:55,303 --> 00:46:57,897
l definitely cannot
sign on Amala's contract.

800
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,535
You'll have to.

801
00:47:08,316 --> 00:47:09,010
Yes, Shivani.

802
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:11,678
Excuse me. - lshaan, why do you
always take so long to answer?

803
00:47:11,919 --> 00:47:12,943
Can't speak now.

804
00:47:12,987 --> 00:47:14,511
Dinner at my place. Tonight.

805
00:47:14,555 --> 00:47:15,852
Yeah, okay. Dinner. Fine.

806
00:47:30,838 --> 00:47:31,668
Thank you.

807
00:47:33,808 --> 00:47:34,832
Here you go.

808
00:47:36,577 --> 00:47:38,875
You must've said thank you
and l must not have heard you.

809
00:47:38,913 --> 00:47:39,845
So, you're welcome.

810
00:47:40,882 --> 00:47:42,713
Thank you. Sorry.

811
00:47:43,684 --> 00:47:46,482
So many?
- There's a scientific logic behind it.

812
00:47:46,521 --> 00:47:48,284
See, l want to have three shots.

813
00:47:48,556 --> 00:47:50,717
So, for company sake you'll
have three pegs of whiskey.

814
00:47:50,992 --> 00:47:53,256
But because you are a man..

815
00:47:53,394 --> 00:47:55,362
lf you would've gone to get them,
you would've gone thrice.

816
00:47:55,563 --> 00:47:57,656
l've done it in one go.

817
00:47:58,266 --> 00:48:00,291
Simple female logic.

818
00:48:00,668 --> 00:48:02,363
All you do is give
everyone a piece of your mind.

819
00:48:05,373 --> 00:48:06,567
What's wrong with you?

820
00:48:06,808 --> 00:48:08,298
Don't be such a cry baby.

821
00:48:08,342 --> 00:48:09,400
Have a drink.

822
00:48:13,347 --> 00:48:15,815
You know what, you should
have confidence in yourself.

823
00:48:16,818 --> 00:48:17,842
Confidence.

824
00:48:26,894 --> 00:48:29,260
What?! She's hot.

825
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:31,689
To understand beauty you need to see it.

826
00:48:31,732 --> 00:48:32,756
Look at her.

827
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:40,707
So, won't you flirt with her?

828
00:48:40,975 --> 00:48:42,499
No. Not my type.

829
00:48:42,643 --> 00:48:46,010
So you won't mind if l
flirt with her, right?

830
00:48:46,647 --> 00:48:47,545
What!

831
00:48:49,383 --> 00:48:51,874
Whoa. Wow.

832
00:49:01,362 --> 00:49:02,420
Hi.

833
00:49:07,602 --> 00:49:08,762
You know what?

834
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:10,498
My friend there..
- Yeah?

835
00:49:10,538 --> 00:49:11,937
He thinks you're really hot.

836
00:49:13,274 --> 00:49:14,263
Check him out.

837
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:17,206
Hi!

838
00:49:21,649 --> 00:49:22,617
Yeah, Shivs?

839
00:49:22,617 --> 00:49:23,743
lshaan, where are you?

840
00:49:23,851 --> 00:49:25,341
You were going tojoin us
for dinner, weren't you?

841
00:49:25,453 --> 00:49:28,479
Actually, Shivs..
- Listen. Anushka is also here.

She so wants me back.

846
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:53,947
Finally!

847
00:49:53,981 --> 00:49:56,745
What took you so long?!
- Hi! Your sister?

Oh hey.

00:50:03,724 --> 00:50:04,656
Anushka, don't rush him.

851

00:50:37,925 --> 00:50:39,722
Okay, now we start again.

869
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,727
Good idea.
- Okay. - Are you coming with me?

870
00:50:40,761 --> 00:50:42,752
Now from Paris we go back to London.
- Let's go.

871
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:44,231
And from London to New York.

872
00:50:44,231 --> 00:50:45,960
No, wait. Let me handle it.
- Then? Go back, back, back..

873

l'll see you.
- Yeah. Yeah. Go. Go!

Shivani will take care of the situation.

00:51:04,485 --> 00:51:05,349
She knows her brother well.

878
00:51:05,386 --> 00:51:07,377
lshaan, Anushka wants to talk to you.

879
00:51:07,421 --> 00:51:08,649
About Agastya and herself?

880
00:51:09,624 --> 00:51:11,785
Shivs, you continue
with your friendship.

881
00:51:12,827 --> 00:51:13,759
l'm done with her.

882
00:51:15,196 --> 00:51:17,494
And tell her l've forgiven her.

883
00:51:17,632 --> 00:51:21,466
And if she is jealous to
see me happy.. l don't care.

884
00:51:21,602 --> 00:51:23,331
Please lshaan, what are you saying..

885
00:51:23,504 --> 00:51:25,597
l'm not used to sulking.

886

Just look at her.

887
00:51:28,209 --> 00:51:30,575
lshaan.
- Shivs, she's really boring.

888
00:51:30,611 --> 00:51:31,635
As boring as ever.

889
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:33,442

Come. Come.

896
00:51:42,923 --> 00:51:43,753
Come. Come. Come on.

897
00:51:45,226 --> 00:51:46,386
Okay, guys.

898
00:51:46,727 --> 00:51:48,285
She can't stay hungry for long.

899
00:51:48,329 --> 00:51:50,229
Bye. Bye. Bye.

900
00:51:51,532 --> 00:51:52,430
Come on.

901
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,998
Just a minute. - Come on. - Bye.
Bye guys. Nice seeing you all

902
00:51:55,236 --> 00:51:56,794
Bye, Sister.
- Angry sister.

903
00:51:56,837 --> 00:51:57,826
Come on, let's go.

904
00:51:59,874 --> 00:52:01,774
l told you. Leave him.

905
00:52:02,977 --> 00:52:04,569
l'm so sorry, Anushka.

906
00:52:04,945 --> 00:52:05,912
Relax.

907
00:52:12,286 --> 00:52:13,617
l don't need him.

908
00:52:16,323 --> 00:52:18,416
Not just him, l don't need anyone.

909
00:52:19,694 --> 00:52:22,219
Come on, Anushka. How will
you handle it all by yourself?

910
00:52:22,329 --> 00:52:24,194
Yeah, l mean.. Why?

911
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,594
l am successful.

912
00:52:28,803 --> 00:52:29,827
l earn well.

913
00:52:33,307 --> 00:52:34,604
What's the problem?

914
00:52:37,478 --> 00:52:40,572
l.. l need a family.

915
00:52:43,517 --> 00:52:45,212
And now my family will consist of me..

916
00:52:46,654 --> 00:52:47,814
And my child.

917
00:52:49,757 --> 00:52:51,281
Come on, let me help you.
- No. No.

918
00:52:51,325 --> 00:52:52,724
Let me help you.
- No.

919
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:54,928
Okay.
- l'm fine.

920
00:52:55,262 --> 00:52:56,820
One, two.
- Okay. You are fine.

921
00:52:59,233 --> 00:52:59,858
Gauri..

922
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,959
No. l'm not drunk. See.

923
00:53:02,369 --> 00:53:04,337
One, two, three.

924
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:06,899
Hey!

925
00:53:08,409 --> 00:53:09,307
What?

926
00:53:13,314 --> 00:53:14,246
lshaan..

927
00:53:16,917 --> 00:53:19,442
l know l am drunk and all that.

928
00:53:19,587 --> 00:53:23,182
But it doesn't mean that
l've lost all my senses.

929
00:53:24,792 --> 00:53:28,489
l.. l mean we are friends..

930
00:53:28,896 --> 00:53:31,456
..but that doesn't mean
l'm going to sleep with you.

931
00:53:32,433 --> 00:53:33,798
So when would you sleep with me?

932
00:53:34,301 --> 00:53:35,325
What!

933
00:53:37,972 --> 00:53:38,961
What's so funny?

934
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:44,740
Day after tomorrow?. How about Monday?

935
00:53:44,945 --> 00:53:46,970
Or Wednesday?

936
00:53:47,581 --> 00:53:50,516
l mean isn't there anything
else in life other than this?

937
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:52,543
Yeah right.

938
00:53:53,654 --> 00:53:56,817
lshaan. lshaan, don't behave like this.

939
00:53:59,593 --> 00:54:00,821
Come on, lshaan.

940
00:54:01,328 --> 00:54:03,262
Hey! lshaan.

941
00:54:03,664 --> 00:54:05,632
Let's be mature about this.

942
00:54:06,801 --> 00:54:09,429
Oh seriously?

943
00:54:21,749 --> 00:54:22,841
Hello?

944
00:54:24,285 --> 00:54:25,217
Yes.

945
00:54:25,486 --> 00:54:27,283
Yeah. Yeah, l'm very busy right now.

946
00:54:27,855 --> 00:54:29,823
Exactly. l told you. l'm busy.

947
00:54:30,191 --> 00:54:31,783
Like l was saying that, you know..

948
00:54:31,959 --> 00:54:33,426
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

949
00:54:38,199 --> 00:54:41,794
Hello?
- A human heart weighs only 250 grams.

950
00:54:43,304 --> 00:54:45,602
lt pumps 5 liters of blood every minute.

951
00:54:45,806 --> 00:54:46,864
Any extra pressure
causes high blood pressure..

952
00:54:46,907 --> 00:54:50,206
..while ultimately
leads to cardiac arrest.

953
00:54:50,244 --> 00:54:51,711
Commonly known as heart attack.

954
00:54:51,846 --> 00:54:53,336
What do you mean?
- Simple.

955
00:54:53,881 --> 00:54:56,816
Don't feel guilty and try to
run away, and say sorry. - Sorry.

956
00:54:56,851 --> 00:54:58,409
Sorry that..
- Sorry that..

957
00:54:58,452 --> 00:55:00,386
l left you alone in
the middle of the night.

958
00:55:00,487 --> 00:55:02,284
l left you alone in
the middle of the night.

959
00:55:02,323 --> 00:55:03,984
l didn't even ask you
how you reached home.

960
00:55:04,358 --> 00:55:05,689
How did you reach home?

961
00:55:06,293 --> 00:55:07,658
l took a rickshaw.

962
00:55:10,698 --> 00:55:12,529
l am really, really, really sorry.

963
00:55:15,536 --> 00:55:16,503
lt's okay.

964
00:55:16,537 --> 00:55:19,734
But the next time we go out,
l keep the car keys.

965
00:55:19,773 --> 00:55:20,671
Okay?

966
00:55:21,542 --> 00:55:23,339
Okay.
- Dumbo.

967
00:55:25,813 --> 00:55:27,248
We have some options.

968
00:55:27,248 --> 00:55:29,716
This works best.
- Six more layouts. - Okay.

969
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:31,775
Why haven't you still
signed Amala's contract?

970
00:55:32,286 --> 00:55:33,253
Why don't you get it?

971
00:55:33,654 --> 00:55:34,643
She's the voice.

972
00:55:35,356 --> 00:55:37,847
l didn't like her voice. Remember?

973
00:55:38,259 --> 00:55:39,521
That's why l am launching..

974
00:55:40,594 --> 00:55:41,686
Sukanya.

975
00:55:45,366 --> 00:55:46,765
l brought her here.

976
00:55:47,735 --> 00:55:49,828
And you invited her to
your dog's birthday party.

977
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,863
Sharp memory.

978
00:55:52,339 --> 00:55:55,467
She attended the party and
my Bugsy and his friends..

979
00:55:55,609 --> 00:55:57,270
..loved her singing.

980
00:55:58,279 --> 00:55:59,906
You can't launch her.

981
00:56:00,347 --> 00:56:01,746
Sukanya's my find.

982
00:56:02,016 --> 00:56:05,008
Really? Then why didn't you pursue her?

983
00:56:05,719 --> 00:56:07,983
You brought ten more girls after her.

984
00:56:08,422 --> 00:56:10,014
And then you started pushing Amala.

985
00:56:10,691 --> 00:56:12,318
l will launch Sukanya.

986
00:56:15,329 --> 00:56:17,297
You can help me if you want.

987
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:22,531
Help? You can't handle it alone?

988
00:56:23,237 --> 00:56:25,637
l am sorry, Beena, but
if you have decided..

989
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:29,803
..to take this company
down then l'm not with you.

990
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:31,375
l'm not with you.

991
00:56:31,812 --> 00:56:33,302
Not even for a minute.

992
00:56:34,248 --> 00:56:36,580
Okay. As you wish.

993
00:56:36,984 --> 00:56:39,612
l've never bossed you around.

994
00:56:40,254 --> 00:56:41,881
So l can't force you to stay.

995
00:56:44,925 --> 00:56:46,256
All the best.

996
00:56:51,265 --> 00:56:53,563
All the best to you and your company.

997
00:56:54,568 --> 00:56:55,500
We quit.

998
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:57,564
Come on, guys.

999
00:57:14,455 --> 00:57:15,513
Sleeveless blouse.

1000
00:57:15,689 --> 00:57:17,213
She wears her sari below the navel.

1001
00:57:17,291 --> 00:57:18,349
A falling veil.

1002
00:57:18,392 --> 00:57:19,586
She thinks she's hot shit.

1003
00:57:19,994 --> 00:57:22,758
You have observed her very closely.

1004
00:57:22,796 --> 00:57:24,491
Please, that's not true.

1005
00:57:24,932 --> 00:57:26,900
l've done so much for CMC music.

1006
00:57:27,401 --> 00:57:29,767
l was the biggest
producer in that company.

1007
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:32,465
No one noticed my sacrifices.

1008
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,674
l told her bye.

1009
00:57:34,708 --> 00:57:35,936
See you around. l quit.

1010
00:57:36,944 --> 00:57:38,741
l, me, myself.

1011
00:57:38,946 --> 00:57:39,844
Will you just keep talking or will you..

1012
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,973
..give others a chance
to praise you as well.

1013
00:57:45,853 --> 00:57:48,583
You like Amala?
- Yeah. l think she's a sweet kid.

1014
00:57:48,856 --> 00:57:51,381
But it's not like l find
her attractive or something.

1015
00:57:51,425 --> 00:57:52,551
You know.

1016
00:57:53,027 --> 00:57:54,494
Hey, Mr. One-Track-Mind.

1017
00:57:54,528 --> 00:57:56,758
l meant Amala, the singer.

1018
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:57,919
Yeah, of course.

1019
00:57:57,965 --> 00:58:00,593
You believe in her?
- Then what!

1020
00:58:01,268 --> 00:58:02,735
Would l spend so much
time on her otherwise?

1021
00:58:03,337 --> 00:58:05,396
Then just go for it, lshaan.
- Huh?

1022
00:58:05,806 --> 00:58:11,642
l mean you are interested in her
so it's okay if CMC music isn't.

1023
00:58:11,979 --> 00:58:13,276
Launch her.

1024
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:14,711
''Launch her?''
- Yeah.

1025
00:58:14,915 --> 00:58:16,280
Are you crazy, Gauri?

1026
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:18,475
You don't know anything
about the music industry.

1027
00:58:18,752 --> 00:58:20,721
l'll have to do a lot of hard work.

1028
00:58:20,721 --> 00:58:22,450
l'll have to spend a lot of money.

1029
00:58:22,656 --> 00:58:24,419
''Launch her.'' Crazy.

1030
00:58:25,726 --> 00:58:27,921
Well, Mr. Music-Executive..

1031
00:58:28,262 --> 00:58:29,923
Work instead of crying.

1032
00:58:30,464 --> 00:58:31,362
Take risks.

1033
00:58:31,532 --> 00:58:33,295
Put your money where you mouth is.

1034
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,862
Lazy ass.

1035
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:40,800
l'm not talking to you.

1036
00:58:41,475 --> 00:58:42,669
Really?
- Really.

1037
00:58:42,876 --> 00:58:44,605
But you are.
- No.

1038
00:58:44,845 --> 00:58:46,745
No?
- l..

1039
00:58:52,653 --> 00:58:55,383
Gauri, l think my son is upset with you.

1040
00:58:55,422 --> 00:58:56,320
Hmm.

1041
00:58:58,292 --> 00:58:59,589
All the boys are the same.

1042
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:00,786
Yeah, l am an idiot, right?

1043
00:59:01,295 --> 00:59:03,729
Yes, you are.
- Yes. Thank you.

1044
00:59:04,264 --> 00:59:08,598
Papa is too. Mummy called
papa an idiot in the car.

1045
00:59:08,902 --> 00:59:09,926
Huh?

1046
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:13,603
Son, don't tell your mummy
that you had pizza here, okay?

1047
00:59:14,374 --> 00:59:15,932
My baby.

1048
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:18,300
He is also my baby.

1049
00:59:18,645 --> 00:59:19,612
And what about me?

1050
00:59:19,913 --> 00:59:21,380
You are my baby as well.

1051
00:59:21,415 --> 00:59:23,645
All three of you are my babies.

1052
00:59:37,831 --> 00:59:39,298
lshaan..

1053
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:40,867
You can do it.

1054
00:59:40,901 --> 00:59:42,334
Everything will be fine.

1055
00:59:42,903 --> 00:59:43,892
Thanks.

1056
00:59:44,638 --> 00:59:48,836
Uncle lshaan, l had a bad dream.

1057
00:59:49,743 --> 00:59:52,678
A bad dream? ln my house?

1058
00:59:52,846 --> 00:59:55,246
But l've already called
the Monster control unit..

1059
00:59:55,482 --> 00:59:57,450
..and banished all the monsters.

1060
00:59:57,484 --> 00:59:59,611
No, they are still there.

1061
00:59:59,753 --> 01:00:00,947
Oh really?
- Yeah.

1062
01:00:01,288 --> 01:00:02,983
Granny is sleeping?
- Yes.

1063
01:00:03,524 --> 01:00:05,754
She's making loud noises.
- Really?

1064
01:00:06,293 --> 01:00:08,261
Louder than papa's.

1065
01:00:08,695 --> 01:00:11,255
Do you know what l do if l
feel scared of anything?

1066
01:00:11,298 --> 01:00:14,267
What?
- l box it.

1067
01:00:16,336 --> 01:00:16,927
Like this.

1068
01:00:19,806 --> 01:00:20,898
Take this, bad dream!

1069
01:00:21,241 --> 01:00:22,367
Take this, you monster!

1070
01:00:22,409 --> 01:00:23,210
Who's the best?

1071
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:24,404
Who's the best? Rishi is the best.

1072
01:00:24,444 --> 01:00:26,878
Rishi is the best.
- Uncle lshaan, l love you.

1073
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:28,745
You are a super hero.

You are happy.

1078

Lean in forward.

1079
01:00:48,669 --> 01:00:50,500

lshaan.

That's nice. Very good.

1089
01:01:31,278 --> 01:01:32,575
You play the piano?

1090
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:35,278
Sojust like that?

1091
01:01:35,749 --> 01:01:36,909
l always wanted to learn.

1092
01:01:37,618 --> 01:01:39,518
As a child l had a dream
of becoming a musician.

1093
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:42,345
Then?
- l grew up.

1094
01:01:42,856 --> 01:01:45,222
And?
- Dreams changed.

1095
01:01:45,392 --> 01:01:46,950
Like?
- Like you know..

1096
01:01:47,928 --> 01:01:51,261
Money, success, etcetera, etcetera.

1097
01:01:51,632 --> 01:01:53,463
Well, then it's
never too late, you know.

1098
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,468
You should always do what you like.

1099
01:01:55,602 --> 01:01:56,728
No regrets.

1100
01:01:57,471 --> 01:01:59,598
Today, l'll give you
your first piano lesson.

1101
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:00,629
You play the piano?

1102
01:02:01,341 --> 01:02:02,808
l know one music piece.

1103
01:02:02,943 --> 01:02:04,877
Do you wish to learn or not?
- Okay.

1104
01:02:05,312 --> 01:02:07,906
Okay. Left hand.

1105
01:02:08,815 --> 01:02:10,783
Yeah. Ready.

1106
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:31,261
Gauri, you are right.

1107
01:03:33,867 --> 01:03:35,494
l should launch Amala.

1108
01:03:36,303 --> 01:03:37,429
And l will.

1109
01:03:38,472 --> 01:03:39,461
That's good.

1110
01:03:40,907 --> 01:03:41,839
And..

1111
01:03:42,743 --> 01:03:44,438
l didn't quit my job.

1112
01:03:45,579 --> 01:03:48,639
l was bluffing about my
resignation and she caught it.

1113
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:53,681
So basically, l was fired.

1114
01:03:57,257 --> 01:04:01,751
So.. you need my help with Amala?

1115
01:04:01,895 --> 01:04:03,795
Yes. Yes, please.

1116
01:04:05,532 --> 01:04:06,726
Okay.

1117
01:04:12,272 --> 01:04:13,569
Just go.

1118
01:04:14,908 --> 01:04:16,341
Oh God.

1119
01:04:16,843 --> 01:04:18,178
Give me that.
- But..

1120
01:04:18,178 --> 01:04:19,941
l'll hit you.
- Okay. - Go. Go!

1121
01:04:24,284 --> 01:04:26,878
''l'm so into you, it's frightful..''

1122
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:29,616
''lt makes every moment delightful.''

1123
01:04:29,723 --> 01:04:31,918
''You immortalize my heart..''

1124
01:04:31,958 --> 01:04:33,858
''My love.''

1125
01:04:35,262 --> 01:04:37,787
''l'm so into you, it's frightful..''

1126
01:04:37,831 --> 01:04:40,527
''lt makes every moment delightful.''
- At least say it now.

1127
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,830
''You immortalize my heart..''

1128
01:04:42,869 --> 01:04:44,894
''My love.''
- Master, you are great!

1129
01:04:44,938 --> 01:04:48,897
''Without you..''
- Come on.

1130
01:04:49,209 --> 01:04:53,236
Working, right?
- ''My life seems incomplete.''

1131
01:04:55,916 --> 01:04:58,476
''Without you..''

1132
01:04:59,886 --> 01:05:05,222
''l'm estranged with myself.''

1133
01:05:07,561 --> 01:05:11,429
''Come, touch with your eyes..''
- Come on! Gauri.

1134
01:05:11,531 --> 01:05:13,624
Gauri. What are you doing? Gauri.

1135
01:05:13,667 --> 01:05:16,500
''My dreams..''
- Gauri.

1136
01:05:16,536 --> 01:05:18,527
Gauri!
- ''My love.'' - Shhh! Be quite

1137
01:05:18,572 --> 01:05:19,630
Come in the pool.

1138
01:05:19,673 --> 01:05:26,909
Okay. Okay. Coming. Coming.
- ''Come, keep your smiles on my lips.''

1139
01:05:27,481 --> 01:05:30,473
''Let me live the moment.''
- Come.

1140
01:05:30,684 --> 01:05:32,948
Wow!
- ''My love.''

1141
01:05:32,986 --> 01:05:35,546
Good boy.
- You wanna play?

1142
01:05:35,589 --> 01:05:39,259
No! No! No!
- ''My love.''

1143
01:05:39,259 --> 01:05:41,750
You know, when l was in Sophia college..

1144
01:05:42,696 --> 01:05:45,665
..l used to skip college and
come here with my friends.

1145
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,901
Mom, did you ever have a boyfriend?

1146
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:51,801
l mean before dad.

1147
01:05:51,838 --> 01:05:53,806
Your dad wasn't my boyfriend.

1148
01:05:54,841 --> 01:05:56,604
From being a strange,
he became my fiance.

1149
01:05:56,910 --> 01:06:01,938
And then we got married. Mom.
- Yes?

1150
01:06:02,949 --> 01:06:04,541
Do you not love dad anymore?

1151
01:06:04,718 --> 01:06:06,310
Of course l love him.

1152
01:06:07,287 --> 01:06:09,585
But sometimes, just love isn't enough.

1153
01:06:09,923 --> 01:06:10,787
What do you mean?

1154
01:06:10,824 --> 01:06:15,420
Look lshu, all relationships
have to have a two-way traffic.

1155
01:06:15,896 --> 01:06:17,796
You should get as
much as you give, right?

1156
01:06:19,866 --> 01:06:21,527
Love is so awesome.

1157
01:06:21,735 --> 01:06:23,828
You don't say a word to each other..

1158
01:06:24,971 --> 01:06:27,496
..and yet you are so
close to each other.

1159
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:32,635
That kind of a silence is bliss.

1160
01:06:34,848 --> 01:06:37,681
''You are my reason to live.''

1161
01:06:37,784 --> 01:06:40,446
''You are the morning to my night.''

1162
01:06:40,487 --> 01:06:42,689
''You are my home.''

1163
01:06:42,689 --> 01:06:44,748
''My love.''

1164
01:06:44,858 --> 01:06:48,726
''Without you..''

1165
01:06:48,929 --> 01:06:52,831
''My life seems incomplete.''

1166
01:06:55,769 --> 01:06:59,705
''Without you..''

1167
01:06:59,873 --> 01:07:04,401
''l'm estranged with myself.''

1168
01:07:18,224 --> 01:07:21,557
lshaan. Meet Taruni,
my girlfriend. And..

1169

01:07:37,911 --> 01:07:41,904
''Come, keep your smiles..''

1175
01:07:41,948 --> 01:07:42,846
Come on. Leave.

1176
01:07:42,882 --> 01:07:46,283
''On my lips.''
- l told you. l told you.

1177
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:48,787
''Let me live the moment.''

1178
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:54,359
''My love.''

1179
01:07:55,028 --> 01:07:57,792
''My love.''

1180
01:07:57,831 --> 01:08:00,391
''Make your every dream come true.''

1181
01:08:00,433 --> 01:08:03,459
''My love.''

1182
01:08:08,008 --> 01:08:11,273
Heavy looks are being exchanged.

1183
01:08:11,945 --> 01:08:13,037
Tarun, l really like her, dude.

1184
01:08:13,279 --> 01:08:14,746
Yes, l can see that.

1185
01:08:14,781 --> 01:08:17,409
No, l mean, l seriously, really,
really like her.

1186
01:08:18,218 --> 01:08:18,980
Well done, man.

1187
01:08:19,219 --> 01:08:20,481
l'm really proud of you.

1188
01:08:38,438 --> 01:08:39,769
One, two, three.

1189
01:08:39,906 --> 01:08:40,964
One, two, three.

01:08:41,508 --> 01:08:43,738
One. Two. Three. Go.

01:08:47,313 --> 01:08:48,439
Cut. Cut. Cut.

1193
01:08:48,548 --> 01:08:50,573
Guys, please take five minutes, okay?

1194
01:08:50,817 --> 01:08:52,307
Amala, just relax.

1195
01:08:53,687 --> 01:08:56,247
Amala, what's happening?

1196
01:08:56,890 --> 01:08:58,983
Can't you even pertorm
two steps while singing?

1197
01:09:00,527 --> 01:09:01,824
lt's not so, lshaan.

1198
01:09:01,861 --> 01:09:03,726
For me this song is..
- What?

1199
01:09:07,767 --> 01:09:10,793
lshaan, Rafiq and l
have tried something new.

1200
01:09:10,904 --> 01:09:12,269
Would you like to hear it?

1201
01:09:13,473 --> 01:09:14,269
Okay.

''lmpressions on the heart..''

01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:31,816
''lmpressions on the heart..''

1204
01:09:32,692 --> 01:09:34,216
''lmpressions on the heart..''

1205
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:35,591
Stop. Stop. Stop.

01:09:38,565 --> 01:09:39,657
What is wrong with you?

1207
01:09:40,767 --> 01:09:42,758
Your launch show is in three days.

01:09:43,536 --> 01:09:45,265
And you think this is ajoke.

1209
01:09:46,706 --> 01:09:49,834

Okay, everybody. From the top.

1212
01:10:06,893 --> 01:10:08,656
Hi, lshaan.

1213
01:10:09,496 --> 01:10:11,896
We don't need the
formality of an interview.

1214
01:10:12,465 --> 01:10:13,955
l'll hire you straight away.

1215
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:15,594

1216
01:10:15,769 --> 01:10:17,566

Who will need ajob..

1218

Who's business will go bust..

1219
01:10:26,412 --> 01:10:28,209
Amala's launch will tell it all.

1220
01:10:36,556 --> 01:10:37,648
Do come!

1221
01:10:45,799 --> 01:10:46,993
Not bad, Shivs.

1222
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:50,326
Staying with Adil you've
learnt to cook good food.

1223
01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:54,431
Thank you. - But Mom, she still
can't make fritters like you do.

1224
01:10:54,774 --> 01:10:56,901
l don't need to. Mom is here.

1225
01:10:57,310 --> 01:10:58,902
By the way, Mom, what is the plan?

1226
01:10:59,345 --> 01:11:00,539
Papa is all alone.

1227
01:11:00,747 --> 01:11:01,543
Yeah, Mom.

1228
01:11:01,581 --> 01:11:02,980
You need to take care of dad.

1229
01:11:04,984 --> 01:11:05,951
Sorry. One second.

1230
01:11:06,452 --> 01:11:07,384
Hello?

1231
01:11:08,454 --> 01:11:09,512
Hi, where are you?

1232
01:11:09,656 --> 01:11:11,021
l couldn't get through to your phone.

1233
01:11:13,259 --> 01:11:15,693
Yeah. No, l tried even earlier.

1234
01:11:16,763 --> 01:11:17,752
Hows your shoot going?

1235
01:11:17,797 --> 01:11:18,855
Gauri.

1236
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:20,666
Our neighbor.
- ls everything okay?

1237
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:21,724
lt's her call.

1238
01:11:21,901 --> 01:11:23,232
She is a very nice girl.

1239
01:11:23,469 --> 01:11:27,200
Yes, we both. We both. - Ever
since she has come into his life..

1240
01:11:30,643 --> 01:11:31,667
Excuse me.

1241
01:11:32,545 --> 01:11:34,536
Mom, you should stop daydreaming.

1242
01:11:35,481 --> 01:11:39,247
lshaan has never taken anyone
seriously, and he never will.

1243
01:11:39,452 --> 01:11:40,714
Shivani.

1244
01:11:48,294 --> 01:11:50,922
Tell him. About Anushka.

1245
01:11:52,265 --> 01:11:54,859
But if Anushka doesn't
want to tell him, how can l?

1246
01:11:55,869 --> 01:11:58,929
And look at him. He is talking
over the phone like a Romeo.

1247
01:11:59,372 --> 01:12:00,930
What should l tell him?
- Yes.

1248
01:12:01,541 --> 01:12:03,600
But to be fair to everyone,
he needs to know.

1249
01:12:04,477 --> 01:12:06,342
When will you tell him if not now?.

1250
01:12:10,016 --> 01:12:11,574
l'll pick you up later, at nine.

1251
01:12:11,784 --> 01:12:13,274
For sure. Don't worry.

1252
01:12:13,786 --> 01:12:15,845
Okay, Gauri. l need to hang up.

1253
01:12:16,456 --> 01:12:17,889
l'll call you back. Bye.

1254
01:12:21,561 --> 01:12:22,823
lshaan.

1255
01:12:22,962 --> 01:12:24,589
l need to tell you something.

1256
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,531
Anushka is pregnant.

1257
01:12:31,204 --> 01:12:32,262
That's quick.

1258
01:12:33,239 --> 01:12:34,501
She didn't invite me for her wedding?

1259
01:12:35,475 --> 01:12:37,568
lshaan, it's your child.

1260
01:12:38,511 --> 01:12:41,480
And that's what she wanted to tell
you the other day, over dinner..

1261
01:12:41,748 --> 01:12:42,772
..but you were just so..

1262
01:12:42,815 --> 01:12:45,215
Oh. She has stooped so
low to have me back?

1263
01:12:45,718 --> 01:12:46,844
And have you lost it?

1264
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:50,346
She said it's my child
and you believed her?

1265
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:51,550
Oh, come on.

1266
01:12:51,858 --> 01:12:53,621
What's the proof that it's my child?

1267
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,325
Yeah?

1268
01:12:56,262 --> 01:12:58,457
lshaan, are you out of your mind?

1269
01:12:58,631 --> 01:13:00,223
What are you saying?

1270
01:13:00,767 --> 01:13:02,530
How can you even ask me this?

1271
01:13:02,702 --> 01:13:03,964
Shivani..

1272
01:13:04,637 --> 01:13:05,797
Why are you yelling?

1273
01:13:06,406 --> 01:13:07,566
What's wrong?

1274
01:13:07,707 --> 01:13:09,231
Say something at least.

1275
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:12,736
Mom, your son.. lshaan.

1276
01:13:13,546 --> 01:13:15,707
You know what he has done?
- l haven't done anything, Mom.

1277
01:13:15,748 --> 01:13:17,375
Anushka is after me.

1278
01:13:17,417 --> 01:13:18,406
After you?!

1279
01:13:18,651 --> 01:13:20,585
Mom, they were together for three years.

1280
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:21,652
Okay?

1281
01:13:22,288 --> 01:13:24,779
Anushka tried to meet you
and papa a number of times..

1282
01:13:24,824 --> 01:13:26,257
..but he never let it happen.

1283
01:13:26,893 --> 01:13:28,690
Why, lshaan? You were having fun?

1284
01:13:28,895 --> 01:13:32,194
Shivani, is this the way
you talk to your brother?

1285
01:13:33,733 --> 01:13:35,223
What has lshu done?

1286
01:13:35,601 --> 01:13:40,231
Shivs.. - Mom, Anushka is pregnant.
With lshaan's child.

1287
01:13:40,506 --> 01:13:43,304
And he is asking me for proof.

1288
01:13:47,747 --> 01:13:49,339
Shivani..

1289
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:52,580
lshaan cannot make such a big mistake.

1290
01:13:52,852 --> 01:13:56,720
Mom! Stop taking his side at least now.

1291
01:13:57,457 --> 01:13:58,947
How many more years will you and l..

1292
01:13:58,992 --> 01:14:00,653
..keep forgiving him for his mistakes?

1293
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:05,227
lshaan..

1294
01:14:06,666 --> 01:14:09,965
ln college when you used to
party all night and come home..

1295
01:14:10,403 --> 01:14:13,804
Mom and l used to lie to papa
that you are sleeping upstairs.

1296
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:15,702
And your report cards..

1297
01:14:15,908 --> 01:14:19,435
You used to get caught
forging papa's signatures..

1298
01:14:19,645 --> 01:14:25,174
And Mom, you used to tell
papa that you forged them. Wow!

1299
01:14:26,219 --> 01:14:28,414
You have always been wrong, lshaan.

1300
01:14:28,688 --> 01:14:30,747
And we have been worse than you.

1301
01:14:32,692 --> 01:14:33,716
Mom, just ignore her.

1302
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:37,196
You know Shivani has a habit of
making a big issue about everything.

1303
01:14:43,636 --> 01:14:45,399
l wouldn't have to face this

1304
01:14:46,372 --> 01:14:48,272
if l would've done this earlier.

1305
01:14:51,411 --> 01:14:56,314
You'll have to learn to
accept your mistakes, lshu.

1306
01:16:26,572 --> 01:16:27,630
Why?

1307
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:31,639
When we have parted ways..

1308
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:38,408
When l am leading my
life well without you..

1309
01:16:39,852 --> 01:16:42,787
When for once my career
seems to be on a high..

1310
01:16:43,990 --> 01:16:47,721
Why all this? Tell me.

1311
01:16:48,794 --> 01:16:50,853
lf this is my child..

1312
01:16:52,431 --> 01:16:53,625
lf it is?

1313
01:16:54,901 --> 01:16:56,732
lshaan, this is your child.

1314
01:16:58,804 --> 01:17:00,465
Then why didn't you tell me?

1315
01:17:03,976 --> 01:17:05,341
l tried.

1316
01:17:06,279 --> 01:17:07,303
A number of times.

1317
01:17:07,413 --> 01:17:10,280
But you..
- Don't give me all that shit.

1318
01:17:13,019 --> 01:17:16,318
Why.. Why can't you hear
someone out for once, lshaan?

1319
01:17:16,856 --> 01:17:18,551
Why is it always about you? You..

1320
01:17:22,228 --> 01:17:25,459
You were never actually
involved with me or my life.

1321
01:17:25,498 --> 01:17:27,693
Oh. Poor Anushka.

1322
01:17:28,401 --> 01:17:30,528
She can do everything by herself.

1323
01:17:31,804 --> 01:17:33,294
What do you want to prove?

1324
01:17:33,472 --> 01:17:34,632
Prove?

1325
01:17:36,976 --> 01:17:41,310
lshaan, actually the truth is,
that l don't want you here right now.

1326
01:17:42,648 --> 01:17:43,945
And l am happy.

1327
01:17:44,383 --> 01:17:45,941
l am happy here without you.

1328
01:17:45,985 --> 01:17:47,885
Oh, l can see that.

1329
01:17:48,487 --> 01:17:49,886
You are so great.

1330
01:17:51,757 --> 01:17:54,658
Anushka doesn't need anyone.

1331
01:17:54,694 --> 01:17:56,662
Oh, wait a second. Wait a second.

1332
01:17:57,630 --> 01:17:59,564
You finally got Agastya, right?

1333
01:17:59,699 --> 01:18:01,826
Where is he? Agastya?

1334
01:18:02,335 --> 01:18:04,394
lshaan, stop it. He is not here.

1335
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:10,438
Then why did you cry
over Shivani's shoulder?

1336
01:18:11,544 --> 01:18:12,841
What were you hoping?

1337
01:18:13,546 --> 01:18:14,376
Hope?

1338
01:18:16,749 --> 01:18:18,774
lshaan, l lost hope the day when..

1339
01:18:18,818 --> 01:18:20,809
The day when you threw
me out of the house.

1340
01:18:25,391 --> 01:18:26,619
Today, mom..

1341
01:18:28,227 --> 01:18:29,819
Mom said that l was wrong.

1342
01:18:31,264 --> 01:18:32,561
All these years.

1343
01:18:33,966 --> 01:18:35,695
Mom and Shivani..

1344
01:18:37,436 --> 01:18:39,404
They all are blaming me.

1345
01:18:39,905 --> 01:18:40,872
All..

1346
01:18:51,517 --> 01:18:52,848
lshaan..

1347
01:18:56,722 --> 01:18:58,713
You can never change.

1348
01:19:02,028 --> 01:19:04,292
Perhaps, that's why we are not together.

1349
01:19:04,764 --> 01:19:08,860
''When l became a part of your dream..''

1350
01:19:09,969 --> 01:19:14,269
''ls when l woke up.''

1351
01:19:15,408 --> 01:19:24,806
''What kind of love is this, beloved?''

1352
01:19:25,985 --> 01:19:30,820
''l can hold you..''
- Hi!

1353
01:19:31,457 --> 01:19:35,518
''But you aren't in my destiny.''

1354
01:19:36,729 --> 01:19:46,570
''What kind of love is this, beloved?''

1355
01:19:55,681 --> 01:19:56,841
lshaan..

1356
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:04,918
''Without you..''
- lshaan.. Wake up.

1357
01:20:05,958 --> 01:20:10,258
''May l not spend a single night.''

1358
01:20:11,364 --> 01:20:15,596
''Close to you..'' -lshaan.
Wake up, let's go.

1359
01:20:16,669 --> 01:20:21,902
''l should spend all my days.''
- Come on. Please, let's go.

1360
01:20:22,241 --> 01:20:31,548
''May l not spend a single night.''

1361
01:20:32,718 --> 01:20:36,848
''Close to you..''

1362
01:20:37,923 --> 01:20:42,951
''l should spend all my days.''

1363
01:20:43,496 --> 01:20:48,593
''When l became a part of your dream..''

1364
01:20:48,768 --> 01:20:52,966
''ls when l woke up.''

1365
01:20:54,240 --> 01:21:02,011
''What kind of love is this, beloved?''
- Sorry.

1366
01:21:04,817 --> 01:21:09,015
''l can hold you..''

1367
01:21:10,322 --> 01:21:14,383
''But you aren't in my destiny.''
- lshaan, l didn't know this is how..

1368
01:21:14,527 --> 01:21:25,199
l'll get a chance to get so close to you.
- ''What kind of love is this, beloved?''

1369
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:30,535
Sometimes l feel as if l
don't know you at all.

1370
01:21:47,526 --> 01:21:52,657
''When l became a part of your dream..''

1371
01:21:52,832 --> 01:21:57,235
''ls when l woke up.''

1372
01:21:58,270 --> 01:22:07,577
''What kind of love is this, beloved?''

1373
01:22:08,848 --> 01:22:13,979
''l can hold you..''

1374
01:22:14,253 --> 01:22:19,190
''But you aren't in my destiny.''

1375
01:22:19,558 --> 01:22:29,194
''What kind of love is this, beloved?''

1376
01:22:31,837 --> 01:22:32,826
Morning.

1377
01:22:33,506 --> 01:22:35,838
One shouldn't have
caffeine early in the morning.

1378
01:22:36,542 --> 01:22:41,536
But to put an end to a few nights
and for a fresh start to a new day..

1379
01:22:41,614 --> 01:22:43,514
..one cup of coffee is a must.

1380
01:22:43,549 --> 01:22:45,210
So, here you go.

1381
01:22:46,886 --> 01:22:50,378
By the way if you want
to talk about last night..

1382
01:22:50,422 --> 01:22:52,447
..then l won't refuse to hear it.

1383
01:23:03,869 --> 01:23:04,893
Thank you.

1384
01:23:07,806 --> 01:23:09,000
Anushka.

1385
01:23:10,876 --> 01:23:12,571
She is my ex-girlfriend.

1386
01:23:16,348 --> 01:23:17,679
And that child is mine.

1387
01:23:22,221 --> 01:23:23,210
What happend?

1388
01:23:23,622 --> 01:23:25,214
She wanted to marry.

1389
01:23:26,191 --> 01:23:28,352
And i was not ready for commitment.

1390
01:23:29,261 --> 01:23:31,889
She wants you back now?.
- No.

1391
01:23:33,198 --> 01:23:34,495
She is very happy.

1392
01:23:34,733 --> 01:23:36,667
She's very happy without me.

1393
01:23:40,606 --> 01:23:44,235
So, do you want to go back to her?

1394
01:23:45,744 --> 01:23:48,406
lt's not about Anushka anymore.

1395
01:23:50,649 --> 01:23:52,207
lt's about us.

1396
01:23:53,886 --> 01:23:54,978
You and me.

1397
01:23:56,622 --> 01:23:59,921
That's why when l came to know
about the baby from Shivani..

1398
01:24:00,359 --> 01:24:03,226
..l don't know why l was
so angry with Anushka.

1399
01:24:03,729 --> 01:24:07,631
l thought my life has gone back
to the place l've come out of.

1400
01:24:09,702 --> 01:24:11,397
Because of you.

1401
01:24:14,807 --> 01:24:18,334
And l also felt angry thinking
about why she didn't tell me.

1402
01:24:18,744 --> 01:24:20,371
Male ego.

1403
01:24:32,524 --> 01:24:34,185
Will you go to Paris with me?

1404
01:24:34,493 --> 01:24:37,792
Paris?
- l had applied for a course.

1405
01:24:38,230 --> 01:24:39,561
l received a letter yesterday.

1406
01:24:39,598 --> 01:24:41,327
l have to go for a year.

1407
01:24:41,834 --> 01:24:44,428
You know, we could start afresh.

1408
01:24:44,937 --> 01:24:48,532
We can stay there in a studio apartment.

1409
01:24:49,308 --> 01:24:52,641
l'll go for my classes and of
course you'll make breakfast.

1410
01:24:52,745 --> 01:24:55,646
You will drop me and you know..

1411
01:24:55,814 --> 01:24:59,807
You can pick me up. We can
go for long walks. Lunch!

1412
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:03,945
You can try the music Scene over there.

1413
01:25:04,957 --> 01:25:06,788
We can settle there.

1414
01:25:10,696 --> 01:25:14,223
l mean only if you want to.

1415
01:25:14,533 --> 01:25:16,501
l cannot force you.

1416
01:25:26,745 --> 01:25:28,474
Love you.

1417
01:25:28,881 --> 01:25:30,712
Wait. What about aunt?

1418
01:25:31,517 --> 01:25:32,848
She'll stay here alone?

1419
01:25:32,885 --> 01:25:33,977
Oh, shit!

1420
01:25:34,319 --> 01:25:35,843
l had to arrange for a

Oh, wow! Paris!

1424

l agree that l've spoilt you..

1425
01:25:56,341 --> 01:26:02,337
But if l've done anything
right in your upbringing..

1426
01:26:03,315 --> 01:26:08,480
Then you, too, do what
is right, otherwise..

1427
01:26:10,489 --> 01:26:15,859
..it will be a difficult old age.

1428

Okay?

Who's the best? Who's the best?

1452
01:28:44,643 --> 01:28:46,235
Who's the best? Who's the best?

1453
01:28:46,278 --> 01:28:47,745
Who's the best? Who's the best?

01:28:53,485 --> 01:28:58,650
'But if l've done anything
right in your upbringing..'

1455
01:28:59,258 --> 01:29:02,455
'Then you, too, do what is right.'

'Ladies and gentlemen. The show is

And you were right.

You know better about the market.

And you know yourself
and your talent better.

You and show them what a
superstar you are, Amala.

Okay?

Okay, guys. Let's go.

1474
01:29:51,410 --> 01:29:53,241
Let's move and no noise backstage.

1476
01:29:55,647 --> 01:29:57,740

Paris is waiting.

Come on.

1483
01:30:19,905 --> 01:30:21,270
Hey, where are you guys going?

1484
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:23,673
The show is about to begin.

1485
01:30:25,944 --> 01:30:27,775
lshaan, Anushka's
contractions have started.

1486
01:30:27,980 --> 01:30:30,244
She is all alone. We really should go.

1487
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:35,982
Let's go.

1488
01:30:36,388 --> 01:30:37,514
Shivani..

1491
01:31:15,193 --> 01:31:20,460
''lmpressions on the heart..''

1492
01:31:20,766 --> 01:31:25,499
''lmpressions on the heart..''

1493
01:31:26,471 --> 01:31:31,534
''Heart is full of impressions.''

1494
01:31:32,210 --> 01:31:39,480
''There are a lot of
impressions on the heart.''

1495
01:31:43,355 --> 01:31:48,952
''Your memories are those impressions.''

1496
01:31:51,897 --> 01:31:57,233
''To support a fallen twig there's wind.''

1497
01:31:57,469 --> 01:32:02,372
''To support a falling
star there's prayer.''

1498
01:32:03,341 --> 01:32:08,335
''What's to support a broken heart?''

1499
01:32:08,447 --> 01:32:11,280
''Everywhere, there's God.''

1500
01:32:11,316 --> 01:32:13,944
''Everywhere, but this
heart is oblivious.''

1501
01:32:13,985 --> 01:32:16,715
''Everywhere, there's a companion.''

1502
01:32:16,755 --> 01:32:18,746
''Everywhere, there's a destination.''

1503
01:32:19,891 --> 01:32:22,461
''Everywhere, there's God.''

1504
01:32:22,461 --> 01:32:25,294
''Everywhere, but this
heart is oblivious.''

1505
01:32:25,330 --> 01:32:27,924
''Everywhere, there's a companion.''

1506
01:32:28,266 --> 01:32:30,734
''Everywhere, there's a destination.''

1507
01:32:52,924 --> 01:32:58,726
''What if we keep the loose ends untied?''

1508
01:32:58,763 --> 01:33:04,463
''What if we assume that you are right?''

1509
01:33:04,503 --> 01:33:09,964
''What if there was no
differences or grudges between us?''

1510
01:33:10,308 --> 01:33:15,644
''What if there was no fear
of a possible heartbreak?''

1511
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:18,615
''We have thought so much about it.''

1512
01:33:18,650 --> 01:33:21,175
''But it never happens.''

1513
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:22,718
''Everywhere.''

1514
01:33:22,754 --> 01:33:24,619
''Everywhere, there's God.''

1515
01:33:24,656 --> 01:33:27,181
''Everywhere, but this
heart is oblivious.''

1516
01:33:27,526 --> 01:33:30,256
''Everywhere, there's a companion.''

1517
01:33:30,395 --> 01:33:32,920
''Everywhere, there's a destination.''

''Everywhere, there's God.''

1520
01:33:35,834 --> 01:33:38,564
''Everywhere, but this
heart is oblivious.''

1521
01:33:38,770 --> 01:33:41,500
''Everywhere, there's a companion.''

''Everywhere, there's a companion.''

1527
01:34:09,734 --> 01:34:11,565
''Everywhere, there's a destination.''

1528
01:34:12,370 --> 01:34:13,337
''Everywhere.''

1529
01:34:13,371 --> 01:34:14,736
''Everywhere, there's God.''

1530
01:34:14,773 --> 01:34:17,173
''Everywhere, but this
heart is oblivious.''

1531
01:34:17,375 --> 01:34:19,707
''Everywhere, there's a companion.''

1532
01:34:19,744 --> 01:34:22,235
''Everywhere, there's a destination.''

1533
01:34:39,264 --> 01:34:40,458
Congratulations.

1534
01:34:40,732 --> 01:34:42,461
She had a healthy baby girl.

1535
01:34:45,203 --> 01:34:46,192
Thank you.

1536
01:35:22,307 --> 01:35:23,638
Hi, baby girl.

1537
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:26,368
l'm your papa.

1538
01:35:29,347 --> 01:35:32,248
l thought l should
prepare you a little about me.

1539
01:35:33,952 --> 01:35:36,250
Everyone says that l'm very selfish.

1540
01:35:37,956 --> 01:35:39,287
They are right.

1541
01:35:42,594 --> 01:35:45,654
Someone once told me that
l can change if l want to.

1542
01:35:46,965 --> 01:35:49,297
That l should never stop trying.

1543
01:35:53,805 --> 01:35:57,571
Today, after seeing you l feel,
that that person is right.

1544
01:35:59,678 --> 01:36:01,441
Today, l have got another chance.

1545
01:36:04,516 --> 01:36:07,917
l promise.. l will never stop trying.

1546
01:36:10,522 --> 01:36:11,511
l'll be good.

1547
01:36:12,624 --> 01:36:13,556
l promise.

1548
01:36:15,827 --> 01:36:16,851
l'll be better.

1549
01:36:18,363 --> 01:36:19,455
l promise.

1550
01:36:20,865 --> 01:36:22,298
l'll be the best.

1551
01:36:25,303 --> 01:36:26,292
For you.

1552
01:36:28,707 --> 01:36:34,373
One day l'll make you so
proud that you'll happily say..

1553
01:36:35,980 --> 01:36:38,676
''lshaan Sabharwal is my papa.''

1554
01:36:41,753 --> 01:36:42,845
And l love you.

1555
01:36:47,792 --> 01:36:48,986
Would you like to hold her?

1556
01:37:06,611 --> 01:37:07,635
Hi, baby.

1557
01:37:12,317 --> 01:37:13,341
lshaan..

1558
01:37:14,886 --> 01:37:15,853
Here you go.

1559
01:37:20,825 --> 01:37:22,850
She needs her papa.

1560
01:37:26,765 --> 01:37:28,232
She needs you.

1561
01:37:36,674 --> 01:37:38,539
After all, she has only one father.

1562
01:37:41,713 --> 01:37:43,647
l think it's a bit too
late to escape that now.

1563
01:37:45,884 --> 01:37:46,816
Thank you.

1564
01:37:47,285 --> 01:37:50,015
l heard that you were
going to go to Paris.

1565
01:37:52,323 --> 01:37:55,554
No. lt's important for me to be here.

1566
01:37:58,263 --> 01:37:59,389
With her.

1567
01:38:01,433 --> 01:38:02,491
With you.

1568
01:38:07,439 --> 01:38:10,931
lshaan, our time is over.

1569
01:38:12,777 --> 01:38:14,574
What will we gain even
if we do get married?

1570
01:38:15,814 --> 01:38:18,339
Fights, arguments, divorce?

1571
01:38:21,753 --> 01:38:23,516
Think about what she will go through.

1572
01:38:26,357 --> 01:38:30,293
We need to build a
world for our daughter..

1573
01:38:30,762 --> 01:38:34,425
..where in spite of knowing
that her parents aren't together..

1574
01:38:34,466 --> 01:38:35,364
..she knows that they are happy.

1575
01:38:37,335 --> 01:38:41,897
Where she knows that even if
our worlds are different, she..

1576
01:38:46,444 --> 01:38:47,843
She is our universe.

1577
01:38:53,384 --> 01:38:54,248
Yeah.

1578
01:38:58,456 --> 01:38:59,821
lf you love her..

1579
01:39:01,559 --> 01:39:02,924
..then don't let her go.

1580
01:39:06,998 --> 01:39:07,862
Hey.

1581
01:39:16,341 --> 01:39:17,273
Wow.

1582
01:39:34,325 --> 01:39:35,485
Thank you. -Thank you, sir.

1583
01:39:40,832 --> 01:39:42,732
Yeah, Anushka?
- Yes, lshaan. Where are you?

1584
01:39:42,901 --> 01:39:44,801
Anushka, l look after
her better than you do.

1585
01:39:44,836 --> 01:39:45,894
Yeah, yeah, l know.

1586
01:39:46,237 --> 01:39:47,295
Anyway, just chill.

1587
01:39:47,438 --> 01:39:48,871
lt's my turn, today.
- Hey, but..

1588
01:39:48,907 --> 01:39:53,241
Good morning, sir.- So it would be better if
you and your husband disturb me a little less.

1589
01:39:53,344 --> 01:39:54,311
But listen, don't be late.

1590
01:39:54,345 --> 01:39:55,243
Okay, bye.
- Listen..

1591
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:56,269
Okay, bye.

1592
01:39:56,414 --> 01:39:57,540
Okay. Bye.

1593
01:40:24,208 --> 01:40:26,438
Hi, Diya. How are you, little one?

1594
01:40:26,711 --> 01:40:28,406
Diya, look who's there, baby.
