So, what happened?

201
00:12:54,413 --> 00:12:59,058
Nothing. The holiday ended and uni
started and life just got in the way.

- Molto bene, grazie. Pretty much the same.

- Yeah, of course. Nothing changes.

- (MADDIE) Mm-hmm.

really, usually, fall in love so easy.

truly love at first sight.

What can I say?

312
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,723

- (ALL) To Maddie.

All right, babe, your turn.

319
00:20:29,453 --> 00:20:30,527
- Oh, no, no...
- Yeah.

320
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:32,677
OK, yes, yes, yes.

321
00:20:32,678 --> 00:20:36,863

as a bit of a surprise to some of you,

322
00:20:36,864 --> 00:20:38,821
not least to myself.

323
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:40,050
Er...

324
00:20:40,051 --> 00:20:43,898
T... Mum's not with us anymore,

325
00:20:44,352 --> 00:20:48,384
but, er... well, you and Lil
are all the family I need.

326
00:20:48,653 --> 00:20:51,839
You were the one who sent me here
and I can't thank you enough

327
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,420
because look what I found.

328
00:20:55,219 --> 00:20:57,945
Er... I've made a lot of
mistakes over the years,

329
00:20:57,946 --> 00:21:01,017
and, Raf, I have to be honest,
when I met you, I thought,

330
00:21:01,018 --> 00:21:02,783
"He's gonna be another
one that won't last.

Hey!

383
00:24:34,714 --> 00:24:37,362
Nice to see you again.
This is crazy, huh?

384
00:24:37,363 --> 00:24:39,858
Yeah, but that's Maddie.
She loves a big show.

385
00:24:39,859 --> 00:24:42,009
I mean, I had no idea
Maddie was your sister.

386
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,392
Yeah, she has been my whole life.

387
00:24:44,813 --> 00:24:48,037
I understand, but...
But if I'd known, I would never...

388
00:24:48,038 --> 00:24:50,687
- But we're in love, so...
- Yes.

389
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:53,145
And I'm so thrilled. Congratulations.

390
00:24:53,146 --> 00:24:55,141
Thank you, and I'm
pleased you graduated.

391
00:24:55,142 --> 00:24:59,289
That was what you wanted, right?
So, er... congratulations to you too.

392
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,104
Thanks.

393
00:25:07,354 --> 00:25:09,657
- OK, this is weird.
- No, it's not.

394
00:25:09,658 --> 00:25:12,306
It's the opposite of weird,
it's totally 'unweird'.

395
00:25:12,307 --> 00:25:15,039
- We gotta tell her.
- No.

396
00:25:16,531 --> 00:25:18,681
OK, maybe it is a bit weird.

397
00:25:18,682 --> 00:25:21,292
But just because it's weird for us doesn't
mean it needs to be weird for Mads.

398
00:25:21,293 --> 00:25:24,364
- I don't wanna keep secrets from her.
- She's my sister.

399
00:25:24,365 --> 00:25:28,165
She means everything to me. If anyone
deserves to be happy, it's her.

- There you are.
- (BOTH) Hey!

403
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,801
- Getting to know each other already?
- Yeah.

404
00:25:39,802 --> 00:25:42,757
Great, because I have a few wedding-y
things I need you to do for me tomorrow,

405
00:25:42,758 --> 00:25:46,597

make sure he looks gorgeous for me.

406

407
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,562
So much for you to talk about!

408
00:25:52,934 --> 00:25:55,276
Whoop! Whoo!

409
00:25:55,277 --> 00:25:57,736
Hey, guys, I'm coming!

410
00:26:20,774 --> 00:26:22,895
I thought you wanted
to kite-surf the world.

411
00:26:24,422 --> 00:26:27,035
We are. The honeymoon.

412
00:26:27,533 --> 00:26:31,652
Oh, funny. Maddie always
said she wanted Paris.

413
00:26:32,218 --> 00:26:34,261
Would you like to try them on?

414
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:38,130
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not the bride, I'm...

415
00:26:38,131 --> 00:26:40,473
It's someone else that
he's marrying. I'm no one.

416
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:44,697
I'm just a friend. I mean,
the sister of the bride.

417
00:26:44,698 --> 00:26:47,423
I guess what people want can change.

418
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,769
Perfect.

419
00:26:52,915 --> 00:26:55,587
I didn't change, Raf. I just couldn't
drop everything and run off...

420
00:26:55,589 --> 00:27:00,517
- into the sunset with you.
- Yeah, I know. Your "real life", right?

421
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:03,513
- How's that working out for you now?
- Great!

422
00:27:03,514 --> 00:27:05,285
Cool.

423
00:27:07,277 --> 00:27:09,736
Are you seeing anyone?

424
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:13,381
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Oh, sorry.

425
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:14,847
Why are you sorry?

426
00:27:16,493 --> 00:27:18,373
Well, that's a no, isn't it?

427
00:27:18,374 --> 00:27:21,906
No, actually, it's not necessarily a no.
I just don't wanna talk about it.

428
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:25,830
I think that sort of thing is private and
doesn't need to be sung from the rooftops.

429
00:27:26,784 --> 00:27:29,471
I forgot. Never say
what you feel, right?

430
00:27:29,472 --> 00:27:32,965
I just don't see why people have to make
such a spectacle of their feelings.

431
00:27:32,966 --> 00:27:35,255
Because if someone sings
it from the rooftops,

432
00:27:35,257 --> 00:27:40,228
you know that they really mean it,
and that's what weddings are all about.

433
00:27:42,682 --> 00:27:45,753
- Buongiorno.
- (SHOP ASSISTANT) Buongiorno.

434
00:27:45,754 --> 00:27:48,210
What do you want me to do,
Taylor? Become a monk?

435
00:27:48,211 --> 00:27:50,322
I don't know, maybe not
fall in love with my sister?

436
00:27:50,323 --> 00:27:53,855
But how could I know she was your sister?
I never met two people less like each other.

437
00:27:53,856 --> 00:27:56,044
What's that supposed to mean?

wasn't interested in them.

come back, like you said,

446

but then I realised you weren't,
and then I met Maddie,

447
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:24,156
and she was so open,
so positive, so full of life.

448
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:27,109

So I'm not full of life?

The don't.

528
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:40,571
I've been out with some jerks in my time,
but you are in a class of your own.

529
00:33:40,762 --> 00:33:42,757
Oh, thank you!

530
00:33:42,758 --> 00:33:45,215
Why did I put up with it for so long?

531
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:48,713
The hope, I suppose, that some day you'd
be the one who'd go down on one knee.

532
00:33:49,709 --> 00:33:51,862
Certainly tried every other position.

533
00:33:52,243 --> 00:33:54,626
Just... leave me alone!

534
00:33:55,392 --> 00:33:57,698
All right, I get it.

535
00:33:59,309 --> 00:34:01,157
Had to try, right?

536
00:34:03,034 --> 00:34:04,805
I'll go.

537
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:12,528
On one condition:
have dinner with me tonight.

538
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:15,978
- It's my hen night.
- We'll do it early, very low-key.

539
00:34:16,051 --> 00:34:17,279
- No.
- Come on.

540
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,349
If those five years meant
anything to you, one last meal.

541
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:24,771
I can wish you well,
show you there's no hard feeling.

542
00:34:25,843 --> 00:34:27,188
And then you'll go?

543
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:29,183
On my honour.

00:34:32,256 --> 00:34:33,330
OK.

- What's he doing here?
- Lil...

550
00:34:42,662 --> 00:34:47,655
Oh, you're such a good friend to Maddie. She
always looks so great standing next to you.

551
00:34:48,154 --> 00:34:51,263
And you were always such
a good boyfriend to her,

552
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:54,412
because she always looked so
young standing next to you.

553
00:34:54,413 --> 00:34:57,178
He's just leaving.

554
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:02,409
See you tonight... love monkey.

555
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:09,119
- Tonight?
- It's under control.

556
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,804
It's never under control with Doug.
He's your kryptonite.

557
00:35:13,805 --> 00:35:15,696
And he's a dick.

558
00:35:17,184 --> 00:35:19,032
Hmm...

559
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:21,829
Mmm...

560
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,175
Aah...

561
00:35:24,518 --> 00:35:26,257
Yeah...

562
00:35:29,011 --> 00:35:31,084
(ELENA) It was horrible hearing
Raf and Taylor fight like that.

563
00:35:31,085 --> 00:35:33,234
They used to be so close.

564
00:35:33,235 --> 00:35:36,383
Is he still hurt that
she didn't come back?

565
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:40,569
Or is it the stress of us having to
pretend we don't know Taylor?

566
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:42,373
Or maybe it's just all the
stress of the wedding.

567
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:43,916
Yeah, could be.

568
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:46,521
Or could it be that they were
both body-snatched by aliens

569
00:35:46,522 --> 00:35:48,018
and are planning to
take over the universe?

570
00:35:48,019 --> 00:35:50,948
Whatever you think, amore.

571
00:35:51,206 --> 00:35:52,748
Whoa!

572
00:35:55,507 --> 00:35:57,508
I love it when you give
me your attention.

573
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:00,548
Argh!

574
00:36:01,613 --> 00:36:05,721
(MIKEY)
Outrageous! Wanna play, do ya?

575
00:36:05,722 --> 00:36:06,873
What's your problem?

576
00:36:06,874 --> 00:36:09,868
My problem is that I hate lying and
I'm terrible at keeping secrets.

577
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:12,022
Ooh, what's the secret?

578
00:36:13,133 --> 00:36:14,795
Er...

579
00:36:16,435 --> 00:36:18,633
I'm pregnant.

580
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:22,234
Oh, my God! That's amazing.

581
00:36:22,963 --> 00:36:24,037
You're happy, right?

582
00:36:24,038 --> 00:36:26,917
Yeah, yeah, it's just really early days
and we're trying to keep it a secret.

583
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,799
Oh, yeah, of course.

584
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,333
Oh, but, wow!
And you, are you excited?

585
00:36:31,334 --> 00:36:32,716
Still taking it in, really.

God, you guys are gonna make
the most amazing parents.

What you gonna do?

588
00:36:44,122 --> 00:36:47,615
Ow! Please don't! Stop it, woman!

589
00:36:47,616 --> 00:36:48,690
How did you get on?

590
00:36:48,691 --> 00:36:51,227
- It was great.
- Really, really well.

591
00:36:54,336 --> 00:37:00,137
So, Taylor, is there someone you'd
like to invite to the wedding?

592
00:37:00,403 --> 00:37:02,092
How do you mean?

593
00:37:02,093 --> 00:37:04,242
Well, like a plus one.

594
00:37:04,243 --> 00:37:06,431
Oh, no.

595
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,433
Well, what about the guy
from three years ago?

596
00:37:11,347 --> 00:37:13,266
What guy?

597
00:37:13,267 --> 00:37:16,492
Oh, that guy?
Er... no, forget about him.

598
00:37:16,493 --> 00:37:20,409
That guy, he's, er... he's gone.

599
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:23,173
- I'll go for a swim, hmm?
- OK.

600
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:26,103
Gone? Gone where?

601
00:37:27,398 --> 00:37:30,316
Just... gone, OK?

602
00:37:30,317 --> 00:37:32,505
Well, does he know how you feel?

603
00:37:32,506 --> 00:37:35,346
If you want someone,
you have to follow your heart.

604
00:37:35,347 --> 00:37:38,572
It might not be part of the plan but you can't
just do nothing, you have to tell them.

605
00:37:38,573 --> 00:37:41,337
(TAYLOR) He moved on. Please.

606
00:37:41,338 --> 00:37:45,983
- Oh, I'm sorry, hon.
- Why? Don't be sorry.

607
00:37:45,984 --> 00:37:48,825
Well, it would be nice for
you to have someone there.

608
00:37:48,826 --> 00:37:51,935
I'm not you. I'm fine by myself.

609
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:57,388
- No one is fine by themselves.
- Yes, Maddie. You should try it sometime.

610
00:37:57,389 --> 00:37:58,885
Permesso...

611
00:37:58,886 --> 00:38:00,767
I got flowers for Madison Jones.

612
00:38:00,768 --> 00:38:05,682
Oh, gorgeous! Raf knows me so well.

613
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:08,569
Oh, I love pink roses.

614
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:14,322
"Looking forward to seeing
you tonight, Doug."

615
00:38:14,323 --> 00:38:16,783
What's he doing here?

616
00:38:17,357 --> 00:38:21,465
He just turned up out of
the blue and hijacked me.

617
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,039
It's just a final farewell.

618
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,228
Well, slamming the door in
his face said it perfectly.

619
00:38:25,229 --> 00:38:29,183
Well, it's nicer this way. Grazie.

620
00:38:29,184 --> 00:38:32,639
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry, I can look after myself.

621
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,673
When? When have you ever
been able to look after yourself?

622
00:38:35,674 --> 00:38:38,092
Like, all the time.

623
00:38:38,093 --> 00:38:40,703
Yes, I'm out there, and yes,
sometimes I make mistakes.

624
00:38:40,704 --> 00:38:42,124
You think?

625
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:46,002
I know, Taylor, OK?
But I live with those mistakes,

626
00:38:46,003 --> 00:38:49,535
and I don't expect anyone
else to sort them out for me.

627
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:52,338
It's better than locking your heart
away, too scared of getting hurt.

628
00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:55,564
I've lived with your mistakes.

629
00:38:55,565 --> 00:38:58,252
Where do you think I've been
for the past five years?

630
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:03,167
And three years before that?
And 18 months before that?

631
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:07,199
Did it ever occur to you that maybe the
reason I'm not all over guys all the time

632
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,467
is because I've seen what a fool you've
made of yourself again and again and again?

633
00:39:21,216 --> 00:39:24,133
Well, I'd rather be like
that than the other way.

634
00:39:24,134 --> 00:39:26,245
And if I've made you afraid of
opening yourself up to love,

635
00:39:26,246 --> 00:39:28,552
then I'm truly sorry.

636
00:39:32,698 --> 00:39:35,080
Is that my necklace?

637
00:39:36,691 --> 00:39:39,805
Just get off my stuff, OK?

638
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,253
OK, ladies, break it up. Time to go.

639
00:39:45,254 --> 00:39:47,987
- Go where?
- The tomato festival.

640
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,745
- I'm not in the mood.
- That's why you're coming.

641
00:39:50,746 --> 00:39:53,509
Oh, I wish I could, but I have a
team of brilliant people coming

642
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:55,813
to pluck, wax and tint me
to within an inch of my life.

643
00:39:55,814 --> 00:39:58,770
Well, you're excused.

644
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,044
You're not.

645
00:40:01,114 --> 00:40:07,103
I like tomatoes, I really do.
But a whole festival? It sounds lame.
