00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
* Jingle Bells *

2
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:12,929
Garfield, wake up!

3
00:00:13,102 --> 00:00:14,402
<i>Good morning, Jon.</i>

4
00:00:14,503 --> 00:00:15,703
No time for small talk, Garfield.

5
00:00:15,704 --> 00:00:17,904
It's Christmas morning, and
you know what that means.

6
00:00:17,905 --> 00:00:18,905
<i>Of course I do!</i>

7
00:00:18,906 --> 00:00:21,706
<i>Christmas means presents!
Lots and lots of presents!</i>

8
00:00:21,807 --> 00:00:22,807
First things first, Garfield.

9
00:00:22,808 --> 00:00:25,035
You can't open presents
on an empty stomach.

10
00:00:25,036 --> 00:00:26,036
(Jon's bells on his shoes jingling)

11
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:27,830
Here are your breakfast lasagnas.

12
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,435
You may eat your way to the tree.

13
00:00:29,436 --> 00:00:30,436
(Jon's bells on his shoes jingling)

14
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:44,072
Ohhh-kay, Garfield.

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,775
You wait right here
while I get your gift.

16
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:49,113
(Jon's bells on his shoes jingling)

17
00:00:53,814 --> 00:00:54,814
(Fanfare)

18
00:00:54,714 --> 00:00:57,162
<i>Now that's what I call a Christmas gift!</i>

19
00:01:03,015 --> 00:01:05,535
It's the gift that keeps
on giving, Garfield.

20
00:01:05,616 --> 00:01:06,616
Here... let me show you.

21
00:01:06,617 --> 00:01:07,617
(Jon's bells on his shoes jingling)

22
00:01:07,717 --> 00:01:08,717
Now watch this...

23
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:11,980
This gift-giving machine
can read your mind.

24
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,462
Whatever you think of, it will give you!

25
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,720
Observe.

26
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:18,921
(Machine chirping)

27
00:01:21,822 --> 00:01:22,822
(Ding!)

28
00:01:24,422 --> 00:01:25,422
Neat, huh?

29
00:01:25,823 --> 00:01:26,823
<i>Let me try that!</i>

30
00:01:26,824 --> 00:01:27,824
(Jon thuds to the floor)

31
00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:30,424
(Machine chirping)

32
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:33,825
(Ding!)

33
00:01:34,826 --> 00:01:36,769
<i>And that's just for starters.</i>

34
00:01:37,627 --> 00:01:40,134
<i>Now this is what Christmas is all about.</i>

35
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:42,308
* Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme *

36
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:43,329
* Gimme, gimme *

37
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,330
* Just when you think *

38
00:01:44,331 --> 00:01:47,048
* All your friends are all accounted for *

39
00:01:47,132 --> 00:01:50,712
* That's the time you gotta ask for more *

40
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:54,100
* Christmas is my favorite time of year *

41
00:01:54,234 --> 00:01:57,000
* That's the time I get my Christmas cheer *

42
00:01:57,235 --> 00:01:57,928
* Come on *

43
00:01:57,936 --> 00:01:59,600
* Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme *

44
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:00,637
* Gimme *

45
00:02:01,138 --> 00:02:02,918
* Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme *

46
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:05,942
* Gonna shake all the goodies *

47
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,040
* Right off the tree *

48
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,041
* Come on *

49
00:02:08,042 --> 00:02:09,880
* Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme *

50
00:02:09,943 --> 00:02:10,943
* Yeah *

51
00:02:12,744 --> 00:02:14,822
<i>Things! Stuff! Gadgets!</i>

52
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:16,169
<i>Toys! Greed! Avarice!</i>

53
00:02:16,246 --> 00:02:17,246
<i>I love it!</i>

54
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:19,047
Hey, Garfield.

55
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:20,925
Garfield, wake up.

56
00:02:21,649 --> 00:02:24,579
<i>Huh? Oh, it's you.</i>

57
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,305
<i>Leave your number, I'll get back to ya.</i>

58
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:31,260
Hey, Garfield. Guess what today is?

59
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,556
<i>Listen carefully, Jon,</i>

60
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,733
<i>I don't do pop quizzes before breakfast, 'k?</i>

61
00:02:37,054 --> 00:02:38,354
Are you ready for this, Garfield?

62
00:02:38,255 --> 00:02:40,411
It's Christmas Eve morning.

63
00:02:40,456 --> 00:02:43,596
We're gonna pack up our presents
and go to the farm for Christmas.

64
00:02:43,657 --> 00:02:45,237
Won't that be fun?

65
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:48,000
<i>You've got a real sick
sense of humor, Jon.</i>

66
00:02:48,059 --> 00:02:49,059
<i>You know that, don't you?</i>

67
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,688
The whole family's going to be there.

68
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:53,603
Dad, Mom, and Grandma, and Doc Boy...

69
00:02:53,662 --> 00:02:56,515
<i>And good boy, and bad boy,
and oh boy, and atta boy...</i>

70
00:02:56,963 --> 00:03:00,030
Come on, Garfield. We have
a busy day ahead of us.

71
00:03:03,464 --> 00:03:04,664
<i>Why is it every Christmas</i>

72
00:03:04,665 --> 00:03:07,226
<i>I get drug outta my warm bed, just to see</i>

73
00:03:07,266 --> 00:03:08,800
<i>some stupid ol' relatives?</i>

74
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:10,800
<i>And why is it I always have to</i>

75
00:03:10,868 --> 00:03:12,300
<i>go to the stupid ol' farm?</i>

76
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:15,232
<i>Why can't they come here
where my warm bed is?</i>

77
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,840
<i>And why... am I whispering?</i>

78
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:22,671
(Lively music)

79
00:03:27,272 --> 00:03:29,422
We're almost back on the farm now, boys.

80
00:03:29,573 --> 00:03:31,473
I can almost smell Mom's chestnut dressing

81
00:03:31,474 --> 00:03:33,184
baking in the oven right now.

82
00:03:33,475 --> 00:03:34,475
(Garfield sniffing)

83
00:03:34,476 --> 00:03:35,476
<i>It's not what I smell.</i>

84
00:03:36,777 --> 00:03:37,777
There's no doubt about it.

85
00:03:37,778 --> 00:03:39,628
Christmas is my favorite holiday.

86
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:42,048
The air is crisp,

87
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,780
homes are brightly decorated,

88
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:47,218
and everybody is walking around
with big smiles on their faces.

89
00:03:47,482 --> 00:03:48,482
(Odie panting)

90
00:03:48,483 --> 00:03:49,922
Almost everybody.

91
00:03:50,484 --> 00:03:52,104
I think the best part is

92
00:03:52,185 --> 00:03:53,637
watching the faces of children

93
00:03:53,686 --> 00:03:56,654
sharing memories of being a child at Christmas.

94
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:01,087
I remember when my brother,
Doc Boy, and I were little.

95
00:04:01,088 --> 00:04:03,092
<i>Oh brother, here we go again.</i>

96
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:05,834
* Dad would chop down the tree *

97
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:06,890
<i>* Chores *</i>

98
00:04:06,891 --> 00:04:08,726
* Mom would fix up a meal *

99
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:09,792
<i>* Work *</i>

100
00:04:09,793 --> 00:04:11,779
* Doc Boy would get in the way *

101
00:04:10,794 --> 00:04:12,445
<i>* The fighting *</i>

102
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:14,500
<i>* Big fat hairy deal *</i>

103
00:04:14,596 --> 00:04:15,596
Arf!

104
00:04:15,597 --> 00:04:17,426
* Decorating the tree *

105
00:04:17,498 --> 00:04:18,498
<i>* Gardening *</i>

106
00:04:18,499 --> 00:04:19,999
* Wiring all of the lights *

107
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,069
<i>* Electrical contracting *</i>

108
00:04:21,201 --> 00:04:23,552
* Wrapping boxes and writing out cards *

109
00:04:23,602 --> 00:04:24,602
<i>* Office work *</i>

110
00:04:24,603 --> 00:04:25,603
<i>* Outta sight *</i>

111
00:04:25,604 --> 00:04:26,604
Arf! Arf! Arf!

112
00:04:26,805 --> 00:04:28,952
*Then we'd take those presents *

113
00:04:29,106 --> 00:04:31,445
* And pile them under the tree *

114
00:04:31,707 --> 00:04:34,554
* We'd barely get a wink of sleep *

115
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,790
* Wondering what they could be *

116
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:37,809
(Odie barking along)

117
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,650
<i>* The special gifts of Christmas *</i>

118
00:04:39,711 --> 00:04:40,711
* Christmas *

119
00:04:40,712 --> 00:04:42,212
<i>* That really make it great *</i>

120
00:04:42,213 --> 00:04:43,213
* So great *

121
00:04:43,214 --> 00:04:44,860
<i>* Are the insomnia-ahhh *</i>

122
00:04:44,915 --> 00:04:48,109
<i>* And the anxietyyyy *</i>

123
00:04:48,216 --> 00:04:51,000
<i>* Kids get from having to wait *</i>

124
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:53,629
* Can't wait till Christmas *

125
00:04:53,718 --> 00:04:55,438
* There's so much to do *

126
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,519
(Odie barking along)

127
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,940
* Can't wait till Chistmas *

128
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:00,745
<i>* Wake me when it's through *</i>

129
00:05:01,822 --> 00:05:02,822
Arf!

130
00:05:02,823 --> 00:05:05,684
Now, behave yourself
this Christmas, Garfield.

131
00:05:06,085 --> 00:05:08,120
No problem. I'll wait in the car.

132
00:05:08,121 --> 00:05:09,121
* Deck the Halls *

133
00:05:09,286 --> 00:05:10,286
(Knock on door)

134
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:16,240
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas, Mom!

135
00:05:16,288 --> 00:05:18,902
Oh! Merry Christmas to you too, honey!

136
00:05:18,989 --> 00:05:20,838
Oh, it's so nice to see ya.

137
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,889
Here, let me take those packages.

138
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:27,491
(Odie panting)

139
00:05:30,992 --> 00:05:33,202
Hi, Dad, Merry Christmas!

140
00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:34,932
Merry Christmas, City Slicker!

141
00:05:35,094 --> 00:05:37,200
Doc Boy! How's my favorite brother?

142
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,790
Don't call me Doc Boy.

143
00:05:38,896 --> 00:05:40,767
And you've probably forgotten,
I'm your only brother.

144
00:05:40,797 --> 00:05:42,924
Oh! You're right.

145
00:05:43,098 --> 00:05:44,098
-Don't mind me.

146
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:46,762
-You can visit till your
lips fall off, for all I care.

147
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,282
I'll just sit here in the dark... alone...

148
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:51,832
until you decide to come
over and pay your respects.

149
00:05:52,002 --> 00:05:55,090
Nobody gives a hoot about
an old woman like me anyway.

150
00:05:55,103 --> 00:05:57,053
How could I ignore my favorite girl?

151
00:05:57,304 --> 00:05:58,804
Merry Christmas, Grandma.

152
00:05:58,905 --> 00:06:01,412
Oh-ho-ho! Merry Christmas, Jon!

153
00:06:01,506 --> 00:06:02,506
How've you been?

154
00:06:02,507 --> 00:06:04,920
Aw, I've been doing ok... considerin'.

155
00:06:05,108 --> 00:06:06,606
What's this, Jon?

156
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:08,284
I see you're puttin' on a little belly.

157
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,418
Is that city life makin' you soft?

158
00:06:10,511 --> 00:06:11,511
Ooof!

159
00:06:11,512 --> 00:06:12,512
(Grandma guffawing)

160
00:06:13,012 --> 00:06:14,312
Ooo, you're gettin' soft, boy!

161
00:06:14,413 --> 00:06:15,826
You need to get more physical.

162
00:06:15,914 --> 00:06:17,937
Take me. I do 100 situps every mornin'.

163
00:06:17,995 --> 00:06:19,594
My belly is hard as a rock.

164
00:06:19,716 --> 00:06:21,218
C'mon, hit me right here!

165
00:06:21,317 --> 00:06:22,317
Gimme your best shot!

166
00:06:22,318 --> 00:06:24,798
Uh... uh... Grandma!

167
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:26,274
You remember Garfield, don't you?

168
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,273
Well, I'll be.

169
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,864
I remember back when all we
had were wood burnin' cats.

170
00:06:31,922 --> 00:06:34,268
But, what'll they think of next?

171
00:06:34,323 --> 00:06:35,323
<i>Bizzare.</i>

172
00:06:35,924 --> 00:06:37,826
Isn't this wonderful?

173
00:06:37,925 --> 00:06:41,024
The whole family is together
again for the holidays.

174
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:44,456
Oh, we are going to have
such a splendid Christmas.

175
00:06:44,527 --> 00:06:47,518
Oh, I'm so happy I could just burst!

176
00:06:47,528 --> 00:06:49,335
Oh, put a sock in it, dearie.

177
00:06:49,429 --> 00:06:51,073
Let's go finish dinner.

178
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,404
I can see Grandma and I are
gonna get along just fine.

179
00:07:00,331 --> 00:07:01,331
* We Wish You A Merry Christmas *

180
00:07:02,832 --> 00:07:04,710
This is what it's all about, right boys?

181
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:07,585
Hard work, brisk weather,
and beautiful scenery!

182
00:07:09,234 --> 00:07:10,234
<i>What scenery?</i>

183
00:07:10,235 --> 00:07:12,093
<i>I think somebody turned the lights out.</i>

184
00:07:12,436 --> 00:07:15,844
<i>In fact, I'd go so far as to say
things can't get much worse than...</i>

185
00:07:15,737 --> 00:07:16,537
(Clang!)

186
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:17,000
<i>Oof!</i>

187
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,439
<i>I gotta quit saying that.</i>

188
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,780
By any chance, you're not thinking of putting

189
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:32,241
chili powder in my sausage gravy,

190
00:07:32,342 --> 00:07:33,342
are you Grandma?

191
00:07:33,943 --> 00:07:34,943
Why, no!

192
00:07:35,744 --> 00:07:36,744
(Chuckling)

193
00:07:36,745 --> 00:07:39,715
Heavens to betsy, child, what
would give you such a notion?

194
00:07:39,846 --> 00:07:40,846
(Lowering voice)

195
00:07:41,646 --> 00:07:44,746
Just cos my chili gravy won a
blue ribbon at the county fair

196
00:07:44,747 --> 00:07:46,390
and your gravy didn't even place.

197
00:07:46,648 --> 00:07:48,794
Who am I to tell you how to make gravy?

198
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:52,073
The Green County gravy
Champion, that's who!

199
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,509
Hey Garfield, where's Odie?

200
00:07:57,651 --> 00:07:58,651
<i>In the barn, let's eat.</i>

201
00:08:00,152 --> 00:08:01,152
(Odie sniffing)

202
00:08:01,253 --> 00:08:02,253
(Odie panting)

203
00:08:04,054 --> 00:08:05,054
(Clattering)

204
00:08:12,255 --> 00:08:14,255
(Odie guffawing)

205
00:08:18,056 --> 00:08:19,056
<i>Hello, what's this?</i>

206
00:08:20,257 --> 00:08:21,900
<i>Why, it's sausage gravy!</i>

207
00:08:33,358 --> 00:08:34,358
<i>Perfect.</i>

208
00:08:34,359 --> 00:08:35,359
Mmm, this smells...

209
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,660
(Overlapping voices)

210
00:08:40,861 --> 00:08:41,961
(Odie whistling)

211
00:08:44,362 --> 00:08:46,362
Doc Boy? Will you say grace please?

212
00:08:46,463 --> 00:08:48,003
Awww, Mom.

213
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:49,665
(In a sing-song voice) Doc Boy.

214
00:08:49,966 --> 00:08:51,466
I never know what to...

215
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:52,667
(Boing!)

216
00:08:52,668 --> 00:08:55,858
Lord,... we just... want to tell you...

217
00:08:55,859 --> 00:08:58,545
how grateful we are for this food...

218
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,120
and um...

219
00:09:01,361 --> 00:09:03,426
for letting us all be here together...

220
00:09:03,762 --> 00:09:04,762
on Christmas Eve.

221
00:09:04,763 --> 00:09:06,463
Amen.

222
00:09:06,664 --> 00:09:10,970
And as surely as the
waters of the streams

223
00:09:11,065 --> 00:09:13,265
and the rivers find the sea...

224
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:16,506
let each of us find happiness

225
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:19,500
and wisdom in this hour...

226
00:09:19,568 --> 00:09:20,568
(Boink!)

227
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:21,569
Thanks, Lord.

228
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,570
Let's eat.

229
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:25,101
Hey, Mom, pass the potatoes please.

230
00:09:25,172 --> 00:09:26,890
Scalloped, whipped,
fried, baked or boiled?

231
00:09:27,073 --> 00:09:29,323
Mom, you always fix too much food.

232
00:09:29,374 --> 00:09:30,674
I know, honey, I know.

233
00:09:30,775 --> 00:09:31,995
Now what would you like?

234
00:09:32,076 --> 00:09:33,496
I can't decide.

235
00:09:33,877 --> 00:09:35,107
Just gimme a piece of pie.

236
00:09:35,378 --> 00:09:37,890
Apple, peach, pumpkin, blueberry,
cherry or banana cream?

237
00:09:44,979 --> 00:09:48,722
<i>Mmmm. Attentive service,
excellent cuisine...</i>

238
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,290
<i>however, the decor leaves
something to be desired.</i>

239
00:09:52,781 --> 00:09:54,810
<i>I give this place... 2 stars.</i>

240
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:55,211
Arf!

241
00:09:55,282 --> 00:09:58,842
You sure are packin' the
food away tonight, Grandma.

242
00:09:58,983 --> 00:10:00,903
I'm eatin' for two now, dear.

243
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:02,484
Uhhh...

244
00:10:04,385 --> 00:10:06,100
That was a great meal, Mom.

245
00:10:06,286 --> 00:10:07,286
Ahem!

246
00:10:07,287 --> 00:10:08,287
And you too, Grandma.

247
00:10:08,288 --> 00:10:09,288
(Laughing)

248
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:10,289
Thank you, Jon.

249
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,760
Well, it wasn't much, but
I was hoping you like it.

250
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:16,700
Hey, Garfield, there's
plenty of leftovers.

251
00:10:17,092 --> 00:10:18,092
Would you like something to eat?

252
00:10:18,193 --> 00:10:20,125
<i>Oh, no thank you Jon.</i>

253
00:10:20,894 --> 00:10:24,420
<i>I've opted to watch my
waistline this holiday season.</i>

254
00:10:24,795 --> 00:10:27,705
Ok, everybody, it's time to trim the tree!

255
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:30,796
(Odie panting)

256
00:10:39,997 --> 00:10:40,997
(Overlapping voices)

257
00:10:43,298 --> 00:10:45,238
Just listen to 'em, Garfield.

258
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:48,430
All jawin' at once like a buncha banshees.

259
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,700
Crazy, isn't it?

260
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:52,201
Of course, to make it
through this whole life,

261
00:10:52,202 --> 00:10:54,238
you have to be a little crazy.

262
00:10:54,503 --> 00:10:55,503
<i>You said it, Grandma.</i>

263
00:10:55,804 --> 00:10:57,204
Why, just look at me.

264
00:10:57,405 --> 00:10:58,905
I talk to cats.

265
00:10:59,006 --> 00:11:00,006
(Laughing)

266
00:11:02,607 --> 00:11:04,370
Careful, Dad, don't hurt yourself.

267
00:11:04,508 --> 00:11:08,360
Why is it we always put
the stupid star on last?

268
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,530
Why don't we put the star
on the top of the tree,

269
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,070
and then put the tree up?

270
00:11:13,311 --> 00:11:16,910
Well, it just wouldn't be Christmas
if we put the star on first, honey.

271
00:11:17,612 --> 00:11:19,125
Hey, Garfield, come over here.

272
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:23,650
Garfield, I have a very
important job for you.

273
00:11:23,914 --> 00:11:26,895
It's a dangerous assignment,
but if you succeed,

274
00:11:26,915 --> 00:11:29,309
you'll be a hero.

275
00:11:29,516 --> 00:11:31,073
<i>A hero. I like that.</i>

276
00:11:31,417 --> 00:11:35,394
I want you to take this star up
the tree and put it on the top.

277
00:11:35,618 --> 00:11:37,643
<i>Climbing trees is my life, sir.</i>

278
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:41,060
<i>If I'm not back in an hour,
send a banana cream pie after me.</i>

279
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,062
<i>This is gonna be a piece of cake.</i>

280
00:11:44,321 --> 00:11:46,598
<i>Never send a man to do a cat's job.</i>

281
00:12:05,522 --> 00:12:06,922
* O Christmas Tree *

282
00:12:10,823 --> 00:12:11,823
(Cheering)

283
00:12:20,124 --> 00:12:22,704
<i>Whoever invented
Christmas trees should be</i>

284
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:24,490
<i>drug out into the street and shot.</i>

285
00:12:24,726 --> 00:12:25,726
(Boink!)

286
00:12:27,327 --> 00:12:28,910
Is everybody ready?

287
00:12:29,228 --> 00:12:30,888
Here we go!

288
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:33,629
Ooooooo!

289
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,900
<i>Nice touch!</i>

290
00:12:40,131 --> 00:12:41,716
And now, everyone,

291
00:12:41,732 --> 00:12:43,832
my little boy is going to favor us

292
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,240
with a Christmas song.

293
00:12:45,434 --> 00:12:47,434
I don't know about this, Mom.

294
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:49,605
Boy, you doggone better well play!

295
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:52,875
Those 24 years of 'pie-a-no'
lessons better be worth somethin'.

296
00:12:53,437 --> 00:12:54,437
Ahem.

297
00:12:55,538 --> 00:12:56,938
(Singing and playing off-key, voice cracking)

298
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,910
* O Christmas tree *

299
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,250
* O Christmas tree *

300
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:05,612
* How lovely are thy... *

301
00:13:05,642 --> 00:13:07,335
-Scoot over, Sonny boy,

302
00:13:07,543 --> 00:13:09,567
let ol' Grandma take a whack at that.

303
00:13:09,844 --> 00:13:10,844
(Playing a jazzy tune)

304
00:13:10,845 --> 00:13:11,845
* O Christmas tree *

305
00:13:11,946 --> 00:13:13,046
* O Christmas tree *

306
00:13:13,147 --> 00:13:15,200
* How lovely are thy branches *

307
00:13:15,248 --> 00:13:16,248
Whoo-boop-be-doop

308
00:13:16,249 --> 00:13:17,524
be-doop-be-doop!

309
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,950
Well, what d'ya think, Dearie?

310
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,788
That was interesting.

311
00:13:23,152 --> 00:13:25,015
Well, you better not touch those ivorys,

312
00:13:25,053 --> 00:13:27,200
till they've had a chance
to cool down for a while.

313
00:13:27,654 --> 00:13:28,654
(Laughing)

314
00:13:28,655 --> 00:13:29,655
Get on down! Uh, uh!

315
00:13:29,656 --> 00:13:30,856
Chik-um, chik-um!

316
00:13:31,857 --> 00:13:33,347
Why don't you play for us, Mom?

317
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:35,648
(Playing sweetly)

318
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:39,049
(All singing)

319
00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:43,489
* Christmas is here *

320
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:46,000
* Mistletoe and laughter *

321
00:13:46,251 --> 00:13:49,091
* Caroles and bells *

322
00:13:49,452 --> 00:13:52,000
* Ringing to the rafters *

323
00:13:52,253 --> 00:13:54,534
* Lights on the tree *

324
00:13:55,054 --> 00:13:57,595
* Candles all a-glow *

325
00:13:57,855 --> 00:14:02,704
* And all who pass by say 'Hello!' *

326
00:14:02,956 --> 00:14:03,956
(Rocking chair creaking)

327
00:14:04,057 --> 00:14:06,200
Why hello, Garfield.

328
00:14:07,158 --> 00:14:10,000
How did you know I
needed a kitty in my lap?

329
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,159
<i>Wild guess.</i>

330
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,300
Since Grandpa passed on,

331
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:15,595
I whiled away many a lonely hour

332
00:14:15,662 --> 00:14:18,070
rockin' and strokin' my cats.

333
00:14:18,763 --> 00:14:20,646
<i>I envy those cats.</i>

334
00:14:20,964 --> 00:14:23,150
Grandpa was a proud man.

335
00:14:23,465 --> 00:14:24,465
A strong man.

336
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,206
He was a good provider.

337
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,035
We never had much money,

338
00:14:30,468 --> 00:14:33,690
but we always had plenty
of food on the table.

339
00:14:34,369 --> 00:14:37,658
And he always made
somethin' special for me

340
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,760
and each of the children at Christmas.

341
00:14:41,371 --> 00:14:43,271
Men like him didn't feel like they could

342
00:14:43,272 --> 00:14:46,123
show much affection
outwardly to the children

343
00:14:46,173 --> 00:14:50,165
but on Christmas it was ok.

344
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:54,335
He always pretended not to be
excited on Christmas mornin',

345
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,750
but his eyes gave him away.

346
00:14:58,976 --> 00:15:03,965
I think... I think it was
his favorite day of the year.

347
00:15:05,277 --> 00:15:07,393
Sometimes I wake up in the night,

348
00:15:07,978 --> 00:15:11,460
and I can still feel his
strong arms around me.

349
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:12,779
(Chair creaking)

350
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,780
(Grandma sighs)

351
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:18,365
This... is the night I miss him the most.

352
00:15:19,982 --> 00:15:25,618
* Keep Christmas here *

353
00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:32,672
* In your heart *

354
00:15:35,972 --> 00:15:36,972
(Playing a flourish on the piano)

355
00:15:36,973 --> 00:15:38,930
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

356
00:15:38,974 --> 00:15:40,750
it is time for...

357
00:15:40,775 --> 00:15:42,689
(Playing a flourish on piano)

358
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:46,490
...Dad, to read us our Christmas story.

359
00:15:46,577 --> 00:15:48,500
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

360
00:15:48,578 --> 00:15:50,280
Which is entitled...

361
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:50,879
(Piano flourish)

362
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:54,605
"Binky, the Clown who saved Christmas"!

363
00:15:54,606 --> 00:15:56,800
Do I have to do this?

364
00:15:57,407 --> 00:15:58,707
Here's the book, dear.

365
00:15:58,808 --> 00:16:00,500
Now, go over to your favorite chair

366
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:02,812
and we'll all listen
to you read the story.

367
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,180
I'm beginning to feel a little silly

368
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:07,200
reading this book year after year.

369
00:16:07,312 --> 00:16:09,612
Oh, but think of the children, dear.

370
00:16:09,613 --> 00:16:10,613
Yeah!

371
00:16:10,614 --> 00:16:12,265
They so look forward to it.

372
00:16:12,315 --> 00:16:13,315
Right, Dad!

373
00:16:13,316 --> 00:16:17,070
Yeah, let's see if Binky saves
Christmas again this year.

374
00:16:17,117 --> 00:16:19,800
(Both laughing)

375
00:16:20,718 --> 00:16:21,718
Ahem.

376
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:23,284
"Once upon a time,"

377
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,080
"there was a clown named
Binky who loved children."

378
00:16:26,622 --> 00:16:29,392
"Everytime Binky saw
children, he would say"

379
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:31,023
"'Hey, kids!'"

380
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:32,944
Oh no no no no no, Dad!

381
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,399
Read it with more emotion!

382
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:35,326
Yeah, yeah!

383
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,000
And and and why don't you
say it like Binky says it?

384
00:16:38,128 --> 00:16:39,128
Ahem.

385
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:42,275
"Everytime Binky saw
children he would say..."

386
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,800
<i>"'Heee-eeey ki-ahhhds!"</i>

387
00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:48,231
Cut that out.

388
00:16:50,532 --> 00:16:52,224
"...and once again, Binky the clown"

389
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:55,110
"saved Christmas for
children all over the world."

390
00:16:55,734 --> 00:16:56,734
"The End."

391
00:16:56,735 --> 00:16:59,995
I don't know about you, Jon,
but for a couple of minutes there

392
00:17:00,036 --> 00:17:02,238
I was getting pretty worried.

393
00:17:02,337 --> 00:17:03,637
Oooo, me too.

394
00:17:03,638 --> 00:17:06,716
Alright, boys, it's time
to get ready for bed.

395
00:17:06,739 --> 00:17:07,939
-Alright!
-Yeah!

396
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,440
<i>Odie?</i>

397
00:17:50,741 --> 00:17:52,280
<i>Now where did he go?</i>

398
00:17:52,842 --> 00:17:53,942
(Song begins)

399
00:17:53,998 --> 00:17:56,900
* You can never find an
elf when you need one *

400
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:59,994
* When you got to get
that toy beneath the tree *

401
00:18:00,545 --> 00:18:02,245
* Yeah, when an elf is whatcha need *

402
00:18:02,446 --> 00:18:04,106
* His energy is speed *

403
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:06,515
* There never seems
to be one who's free *

404
00:18:07,848 --> 00:18:10,040
* Then comes that magical moment *

405
00:18:10,449 --> 00:18:13,008
* So the story goes on Christmas Eve *

406
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,520
* When elves and other weirdos *

407
00:18:17,051 --> 00:18:19,814
* Think it's better to give,
than receive! *

408
00:18:20,052 --> 00:18:23,096
* See, did you never find
an elf when you need one *

409
00:18:23,453 --> 00:18:26,176
* And you don't know whatcha gonna do *

410
00:18:27,254 --> 00:18:29,510
* But if you believe *

411
00:18:30,355 --> 00:18:34,950
* The magic of Christmas Eve *

412
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:36,156
* Well then, one *

413
00:18:36,457 --> 00:18:37,457
* Finds *

414
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,158
* You! *

415
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,559
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

416
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,270
<i>These letters must be...
50 years old.</i>

417
00:18:46,761 --> 00:18:47,761
(Whispering)

418
00:18:47,762 --> 00:18:48,762
Hey... Dad...

419
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:50,563
Psst!

420
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:51,564
Hey, Dad.

421
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:52,565
You awake?

422
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:53,566
Daa-aad.

423
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,286
Dad! You awake?!

424
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,168
Well, I'm awake now.

425
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,623
What do you boys want?

426
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,250
Is it time to open our presents yet?

427
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:02,980
It's 1:30 in the morning.

428
00:19:03,072 --> 00:19:05,620
No, it's not time to open presents yet.

429
00:19:06,973 --> 00:19:09,525
It is Christmas morning now, ya know.

430
00:19:09,874 --> 00:19:11,650
Doc Boy has a point there, Dad.

431
00:19:11,675 --> 00:19:15,204
Anytime after midnight is technically
Christmas morning, ya know.

432
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:17,595
Go-- to bed!

433
00:19:17,777 --> 00:19:18,777
Alright, alright.

434
00:19:18,778 --> 00:19:19,376
(Saying sarcastically)

435
00:19:19,378 --> 00:19:21,409
Pleasant dreams, Dad.

436
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,410
(Mumbling)

437
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:25,100
-It is Christmas morning.
-I know that and you know that.

438
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,080
(Closes door)

439
00:19:31,581 --> 00:19:33,600
(Rooster crowing)

440
00:19:37,382 --> 00:19:39,100
Well, whaddya boys wanna do first?

441
00:19:39,483 --> 00:19:40,483
Do you wanna do chores?

442
00:19:40,784 --> 00:19:42,112
Do you wanna eat breakfast?

443
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:44,620
Or do you wanna open presents?!

444
00:19:44,686 --> 00:19:45,186
(Both yelling)

445
00:19:45,287 --> 00:19:46,687
Presents!

446
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:49,688
(Exclaiming over gifts)

447
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:51,530
Oh, Mom and Dad, thank you.

448
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,690
You're welcome, honey.

449
00:19:55,689 --> 00:19:58,840
Well, that was a very nice Christmas.

450
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,500
<i>It's not over yet. One minute.</i>

451
00:20:10,491 --> 00:20:12,660
Why, thank you, Garfield.

452
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:13,992
What's this?

453
00:20:14,893 --> 00:20:15,993
Oh, my.

454
00:20:17,294 --> 00:20:19,130
Ohhh, my.

455
00:20:19,195 --> 00:20:20,500
What are they, Grandma?

456
00:20:20,696 --> 00:20:24,200
Jon, these are love
letters your Grandpa sent me

457
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:27,350
when we were courtin'
a long, long time ago.

458
00:20:27,498 --> 00:20:28,298
(Reading)

459
00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:29,309
"My Darling,"

460
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,100
"If the sea were of ink
and the sky of parchment,"

461
00:20:32,301 --> 00:20:34,780
"I could not begin to write my love for you."

462
00:20:33,302 --> 00:20:35,902
(Chuckling)

463
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,730
"When next we meet, ..."

464
00:20:40,104 --> 00:20:41,104
Oh...

465
00:20:41,405 --> 00:20:43,490
Oh-ho-ho-ho-my.

466
00:20:43,606 --> 00:20:44,606
(Chuckling)

467
00:20:45,507 --> 00:20:47,600
Well, what does he say, Grandma?

468
00:20:47,908 --> 00:20:51,800
It is inappropriate for a lady
to talk about her romances, my dear.

469
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,600
Garfield, I don't know how you
managed to find these letters.

470
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:59,600
I think they are the nicest
presents I could've received.

471
00:20:59,911 --> 00:21:03,100
Thank you very, very much.

472
00:21:03,612 --> 00:21:05,900
<i>Yeah, you might say I just kinda...</i>

473
00:21:06,013 --> 00:21:07,213
<i>fell into 'em.</i>

474
00:21:07,214 --> 00:21:09,214
(Odie panting and barking)

475
00:21:12,015 --> 00:21:13,415
<i>What is it, Odie?</i>

476
00:21:13,516 --> 00:21:14,516
Bark!

477
00:21:17,017 --> 00:21:18,717
<i>Ok, I'm coming.</i>

478
00:21:21,618 --> 00:21:22,718
Ruff! Ruh-ruh-ruff!

479
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:23,990
<i>Ok, whaddya want?</i>

480
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,420
Tah-dah!

481
00:21:26,821 --> 00:21:28,970
<i>Okaaaay... what is it?</i>

482
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,022
(Scratching sound)

483
00:21:40,023 --> 00:21:43,130
<i>Whoa-ho-ho-ho, let me try that!</i>

484
00:21:44,224 --> 00:21:46,024
(Scratching sound)

485
00:21:48,425 --> 00:21:51,420
<i>Odie? Sometimes you amaze me.</i>

486
00:21:52,626 --> 00:21:55,400
<i>This is the best present
a cat could ever get.</i>

487
00:21:56,227 --> 00:21:58,800
<i>Now and then, you're somethin' special.</i>

488
00:22:01,828 --> 00:22:03,900
(All going "Awwww")

489
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:09,100
<i>Alright you guys, just permit me
one sentimental moment here, will ya?</i>

490
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,000
<i>I have something to say.</i>

491
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:12,831
<i>Christmas...</i>

492
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,860
<i>it's not the giving...</i>

493
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,533
<i>it's not the getting...</i>

494
00:22:17,034 --> 00:22:18,534
<i>it's the loving.</i>

495
00:22:19,035 --> 00:22:20,835
<i>There, I said it.</i>

496
00:22:21,236 --> 00:22:22,690
<i>Now get outta here.</i>

497
00:22:24,237 --> 00:22:26,237
(Country banjo music)

498
00:22:29,238 --> 00:22:31,450
* Let's have a good old fashioned Christmas *

499
00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:33,090
* Down on the farm *

500
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,140

501
00:22:36,241 --> 00:22:37,801
* Let's open up the presents *

502
00:22:37,804 --> 00:22:39,402

511
00:22:54,451 --> 00:22:56,035
* And sing a song or two *

512
00:22:56,352 --> 00:22:58,020
