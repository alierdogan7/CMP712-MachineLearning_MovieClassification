- I know who the father is.
- Yeah?

184
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,458
You know that, you know a lot.

185
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:46,838
If the baby comes out white
and squishy, crying his ass off,

186
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,756
then we know Woof
is definitely the daddy.

187
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:52,093
But if he comes out all beautiful
and chocolate brown,

188
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,636
that's mine.

189
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:57,932
- [Woof] "White and squishy"?
- Yeah, man. White and squishy.

190

[All laughing]

191
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,770
Listen, he come out and see
your crazy black ass standing there,

192
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,481
he's gonna be spitting
watermelon seeds in your face.

193
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,526
You always open up your mouth
before you even think.

194
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,487
Look, when this baby
comes out and sees me,

195
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,948
he's gonna be so happy
and so proud.

196
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,617
Do you know what he's gonna say?

197
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,870

358
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,462
- [Knocking continues]
- Just a minute!

359
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,798
[Man] What's taking so long, love?

360
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,967
- [Whispering] We're smoking grass.
- I'm getting dressed.

361
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,970
Sweetheart, come on. You have a lot
of people waiting to see you.

362
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,431
Will you relax, Daddy?

363
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,891
Well, hurry up.
[Rattles doorknob]

364
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,768
- What's going on here?
- They're getting dressed.

365
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,311
Open the door this minute!

366
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:53,897
- I'm taking care of it.
- I can see you are.

367
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,733
[Knocking]

368
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,276
[Father] Sheila?

369
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,445
- Yes?
- [Giggling]

370
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,698
There's no excuse
for this performance.

371
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,704
Hello.

372
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,623
[Indistinct chattering]

373
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,974
Ted, Ted...

374
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,705
Excuse me. Mr. Berger?

375
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,166
- You can call me George.
- I think that it's a private party.

376
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,336
I think you and your friends
better leave, please.

377
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:00,589
- You do?
- Yes, I think that's the thing to do.

378
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,217
OK.

379
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,597
- [Hitting glass]
- Mr. Berger...

380
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:09,681
[Berger] Excuse me, everybody.

381
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:12,267
- Everybody, please quiet down.
- Mr. Berger...

382
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:14,645
I think that you and your...

383
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,355
I just wanted to say a few words,
then we'll go.

384
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,233
- I don't care what you have to say.
- I know. Everybody, listen.

385
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,693
- We weren't invited to this party...
- Mr. Berger.

386
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:25,364
Just a second.
I just want to talk for a second, OK?

387
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:28,534
- I don't care about that.
- I know you don't care.

388
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,702
- I think you better leave.
- Please, just give me two minutes.

389
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,246
Just wanna talk to
the people for a second.

390
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:34,873
- All right?
- No.

391
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,251
- Please.
- No, I think you better go.

392
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,752
Please.

393
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:42,464
I'm losing my patience.
This is a private party.

394
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,675
You were not invited.
You'd better leave.

395
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,760
- You don't understand.
- I have nothing to understand.

396
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:47,803
You got something to understand.

397
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,805
You don't understand what this man
will be doing for you.

398
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,766
- I don't want to hear about it.
- You should hear about it!

399
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,060
- You know what he's gonna do for you?
- I don't care!

400
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:58,897
You should care because
he's gonna be fighting for you.

401
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,567
He's going to Vietnam to fight for you,
to save your life!

402
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,986
- I don't care what he's gonna do.
- To save your life!

403
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,487
Or what you're gonna do.

404
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,739
- I want you out!
- You should care!

405
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:13,328
If you want me out of here,
you'll have to throw me out.

406
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:15,747
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

407
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,669
I'm gonna get the police. I'm not gonna
muss myself up fussing with you.

408
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,964
- I'll get the police if I have to.
- OK.

409
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,510
- That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
- OK.

410
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:32,806
Penguin.

411
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,895
Now, my friend, Claude, here,
is in love.

412
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,521
He saw this chick on a horse...

413
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,148
- Excuse me.
- Jesus.

414
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,359
[Man] Now, let's deal
with this as gentlemen.

415
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:47,571
- OK. OK. Good.
- Quietly. As gentlemen.

416
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,365
- Now may I give you a word of advice?
- Yeah.

417
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:54,161
Get your ass out of here, now.

418
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,872
Is that it?

419
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,124
- That's it, yes.
- Thank you.

420
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,959
Now, listen.

421
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,586
Claude here is in love.

422
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,173
The girl he's in love with
is sitting in this room.

423
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:11,345
He just wants to sit here
and look at her for five minutes.

424
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:14,848
He just wants to look at her
and have this picture in his head

425
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,017
when he's off there fighting
in the jungles.

426
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:23,899
Is that so much to ask?
Hey! This is for you, man.

427
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,360
Wait a minute.
This is what you want.

428
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:30,072
Sheila, is that OK if Claude
just sits here and looks at you

429
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,407
for a few minutes before we go?

430
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:38,038
You've got a hell of a nerve,
young man.

The court is about to pronounce
sentence upon each of you.

The sentence of the court:

475
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:17,489
You be confined to the workhouse

or pay a fine of $50.

477

Your Honor,
I don't think you understand.

478
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,582
We haven't got any bread.

479
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,044
I'm awfully sorry.
There isn't anything I can do.

480
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,301
- [Claude] Your Honor?
- Yes, sir?

481
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,679
What if one of us has the money?

482
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,056
- Which one?
- I do.

- Just one second. Claude, listen.

490
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,462
Let me get out of here.
I'll go and get the money.

491
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,840
- Then I'll get everybody out.
- This is my money.

492
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:20,635
I'm sorry, but my dad gave me
this money in case of trouble.

493
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:22,345
- This is trouble.
- Don't be stupid, man.

494
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,140
This is your last chance
to get us out of here.

495
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,268
Just stop it. This is mine.
I'm getting out of here.

496
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:33,148
- Don't you trust me?
- Of course not.

497
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,610
Look, man, don't be stupid.

498
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:42,199
How will you get the bread?
You don't know anybody on the streets.

499
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,034
How you gonna get the bread?

500
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:51,666
He's not, man. He's just gonna leave us
in here to rot, that's all.

501
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:55,712
- No, I can make some calls.
- Yeah, call my mama.

502
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,140
You better know what you're doing.

503
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,226
You sure better, George.

[Horn honking]

505
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,170
What's that?

506
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:51,685
Uh, excuse me.
You're in our way.

507
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,270
What?

508
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,357
You're blocking our way.
Would you move, please?

509
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,942
Sure.

510
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,083
- Hi.
- Hi.

511
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,835
Remember me?

512
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,545
Yeah.

513
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,047
Come on in.

514
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,467
We have to get to school.

515
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,636
Great.
Just get in, will you?

516
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,722
What do you want?

517
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,894
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

518
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,982
Jesus H. Christ!
What do you think you're doing?

519
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:44,571
You can't drive this car! We're only
covered for Dad and me, OK? Sheila...

520
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,324
Listen, man, I got a little problem.
I need some bread right away.

521
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,993
It's $250.
I need it now.

522
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:53,246
- This is all about money?
- Yeah. You got any?

523
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,956
No.

524
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:58,043
Look, we really don't have any time now.

for the bread to get them out.

- Yeah.

At least he could get us out of it.

- Yeah.

and break all the dishes?

- It's impossible.

- He won't even give me a credit card.

543

- It's coming up here!

We'll try to get you some money. OK?

00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,181
Listen, I was thinking...

698
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,851
...would you like to get married?

699
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,686
What?

700
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:03,105
Would you like to get married?

701
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:06,776
- To whom?
- Me.

702
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:14,742
Because I was thinking I'm having
this baby, and, if you were married,

703
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,328
the Army couldn't take you.

704
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,872
They wouldn't take you because they
don't take people who are married

705
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,416
and are having babies.

Watching the water.

Look at the sky.
Look at the stars.

Will you take me home now, please?

Are we going to do something?

792

- Yeah, we'll do something.
- Yeah.

What are you gonna do?

794
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,360
I don't know.
It's Claude's night.

- You're just taking me home, right?
- Yeah.

806
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:36,470
- No, you know what I mean.
- I'm just taking you home.

807
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:39,097
Because nothing's gonna happen.

808
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:41,433
No, I'm just gonna take you home.

809
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:49,358
No. No, no. I think
I'll go home by myself.

810
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,443
No, I'll take you home.

811
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:56,406
- I don't feel like it.
- Why not?

812
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:02,037
I don't have to
explain everything to you...

Listen, I'm sorry.

817
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:19,239
I didn't mean to be so...

818
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:21,533
I'm really sorry.
I wasn't trying to upset you.

819
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,452
That's all right.

820
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,996
It's just sometimes I get so...

821
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:27,706
I understand.

822
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:29,541
- You're upset, right?
- Oh, no.

823
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:32,127
No, you are.
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,880
I just... But I just thought...

825
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:38,383
- You're going away tomorrow, right?
- Yeah.

826
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:41,428
So, what's the point?

827
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:44,890
You mean, if I wasn't going away,
it would be different?

828
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,516
Maybe.

829
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:48,310
Well...

830
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:52,564
- I might not go.
- Right.

831
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:54,816
- You expect me to believe that?
- I'm serious.

832
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:56,943
Forget it.
I don't believe you.

833
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:07,037
Hey... Where did everybody else go?

834
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:09,873
They're around somewhere.
Jeannie's still up there.

835
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:15,754
Hey, where are our clothes?

836

You guys are so mature.

840
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:50,747
Don't look at me.
I didn't have anything to do with it.

841
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:56,753
Don't worry about it.
They're around.

842
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:00,465
Berger!

843
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:10,976

I've got your purse! Sheila, wait!

847
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,092
I don't believe it, man.
What happened?

848
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:45,260
What happened?

849
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,137
What the hell did you do that for?

850
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:50,182
- It was fun, man.
- Fun?

851
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,477
I'm really sorry.

852
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:56,855
I didn't think she'd ever
pull a stunt like that.

853
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:00,567
We know where she lives. We'll give
her clothes back tomorrow. It's cool.

854
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:02,402
I won't be here tomorrow.

855
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:06,114
You're not still serious
about that shit, are you?

856
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:09,701
That's none of your goddamn business.

857
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:13,205
It is my goddamn business, man.
What do you want?

858
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:16,374
You want to be a hero with a gun,
a big macho dude in a uniform?

859
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:20,378
- Is that what you want?
- I can't talk to you.

860
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:22,506
I'm standing right here.
Talk to me.

861
01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:24,424
I'm right here. Talk to me.

862
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:27,844
I think you're ridiculous.

863
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:30,931
I am ridiculous.

864
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:33,558
I'm totally ridiculous.
I'm ludicrous.

865
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:35,894
I don't want to go over there
and murder women and babies.

866
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:39,314
Go ahead and be ridiculous,
and I'll do what I have to do.

867
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:41,066
Who are you doing it for?

868
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:42,734
I'm doing it for you, man.

869
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:46,363
Look, don't hand me that.
If you're doing it for me, don't.

870
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:49,699
Because if the shoe was on the
other foot, I wouldn't do it for you.

871
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:56,081
Give me my clothes.

872
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:14,015

- I'm gonna get a car.

- How? How can you get a car?

1063
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:25,366

1064

What are you doing here?
Come on.

1065
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,704
- I said come with me.
- I heard you.

1066
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:32,623
I'm asking you, who is that woman?

1067
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:38,421
- Are you a friend of my Lafayette?
- I ain't no Lafayette no more.

1068
01:18:38,588 --> 01:18:42,007
- Don't bother her, all right?
- What have you done to your head?

1069
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:46,137
Never mind.
Just go on back home.

1070
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:50,224

1071
01:18:52,477 --> 01:18:56,439
- Look, don't be talking to her.
- Is that your child?

1072
01:18:58,650 --> 01:19:00,109
You wouldn't understand.

1073
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:05,489
What do you mean?
Is that your child or isn't it?

1074
01:19:05,657 --> 01:19:07,324
What kind of question is that?

1075
01:19:07,492 --> 01:19:09,827
Maybe it is and maybe it isn't.

01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:11,495

You don't understand anything.

- I'm taking you to the bus.

- I don't want to go home!

You're going back home.
Understand me?

1087

- I want to stay with you.
- You can't.

1088
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:54,914
- Why not?
- Because you can't. I said so.

1089

Look, we've got a friend in trouble,
and we have to help him.

1090

Baby, that's all you need to know.
Why don't you just go home?

help your friends, Lafayette.
