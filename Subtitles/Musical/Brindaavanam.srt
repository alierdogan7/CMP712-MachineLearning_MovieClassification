00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:21,509
Brindavanam belongs to everyone". 
Lurd Krishna belongs to everyone".

2
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:34,759
Why are you jealousy Radha? 
Admiring beauty is everyunds happiness".

3
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,547
Brother! 
- What?

4
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:47,136
Gut him? 
- No brother, not yet.

5
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,671
As soon as you get him, 
lynch the bastard!

6
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,172
Pick up the phone!

7
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:26,421
Krish, Lavanya's brother has come 
to know, they are after me.

8
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:27,384
Where are you now?

9
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:29,886
Stop there, you bastard!

10
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:41,295
Man with great strength and stamina...

11
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,048
Dashing dsbcnairu.

12
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:52,752
Man of action...

13
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:55,170
Man who can charm anyone...

14
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:58,254
He's a winner...

15
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,127
Got him'?

16
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,878
Why did you bring me here? 
This is Lavanya's house.

17
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,379
You love her, right'? 
Risk is unavoidable.

18
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,251
Who are you?

19
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:35,883
Are you chasing the lover of your 
sister without knowing who he is?

20
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,376
He's the lover.

21
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,503
I don'! know if you were 
a good brother to your sister,

22
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,628
but he's the man who made 
you feel like brother,

23
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:51,008
if everything happens as I think, 
then he's your brother-in-law.

24
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:18,587
You're right to go after him 
for loving your sister,

25
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,219
that's why I've brought him 
here to discuss,

26
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,127
after discussion,

27
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:26,094
if you dare to say no or impossible,

28
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:51,254
If you can face the next 
five minutes bravely,

29
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,756
you can face anything in Iife.

30
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:59,508
They want you not me!

31
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,343
What happened to him?

32
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:43,004
For next 5 minutes he's numb.

33
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,627
You go and get Lavanya.

34
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,877
Brother-in-law, I'm sloping 
with your sister,

35
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,380
please don't lake it to your heart.

36
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:58,838
Don'! try In find them.

37
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,378
Because I'm between you and them

38
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,254
If you're confident of 
going past me, then come.

39
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,877
I'll kill you!

40
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,628
Not you, your confidence.

41
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:51,543
What brings you here, son?

42
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:53,761
Dad, I want 30 minutes of your time.

43
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:56,545
My life is yours, son. 
Come.

44
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:59,876
Sir...what about this meeting?

45
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:06,299
Cancel that contract. 
My son is here.

46
00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:10,169
You in my office?

47
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:12,920
He called on phone and asked 
me to be here in 10 minutes.

48
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:14,294
So, here I am. 
- Come.

49
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:21,043
Did you frisk them'?

50
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,923
Not only that he got us 
married too, uncle.

51
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:31,552
When I was young, I too had the same 
idea cf getting my friend married,

52
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,923
but I couldn't do it,

53
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:36,921
he has done it. 
- You always tell this story.

54
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:39,044
Please bless us sir. 
- Bless us sir.

55
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:45,627
We are all young, so your blessings 
could make them little brave.

56
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:50,127
If there's anything like that, 
you please don't do like this.

57
00:09:50,292 --> 00:09:52,795
Introduce her to us.

58
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,127
Where are you rushing off, son?

59
00:09:57,292 --> 00:09:59,294
To do what you didn't do, uncle.

60
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:00,793
What?

61
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:20,629
Hot youth never cares anyone...

62
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:23,796
Youth take a turn in college...

63
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,174
Brain gets blown up 
and is shocked...

64
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:30,671

Young men's heart".

Ready to face anything bravely 
but not you...

67
00:10:47,042 --> 00:10:50,046
Rabelling youth but never 
gets angry with you...

68
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:53,137
Our aim is your order...

69
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:56,501
Who is for whom...

70
00:10:56,667 --> 00:11:00,001
Dream? Trap? Ambition?

71
00:11:03,292 --> 00:11:07,001
History? Future? Maiden?

72
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:38,925
Thin waist...cat walk... 
mock angers... many more...

73
00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:42,046
We don'! want freedom...

74
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:45,546
We got imprisoned in 
your eyes willingly...

75
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:48,671
A story that moved every nerve...

76
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,049
It's you who did it intelligently...

77
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,049
Isn't cur life blessed'?

78
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:58,501
If you look at us...

79
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:01,511
It's moonbeam in Iife... 
It's scary when your lips move...

80
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:03,010
Eyes refuse In look straight at you...

81
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:05,545
Mind is blown up getting 
enchanted by girls...

82
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:49,042
Arrogant girls...Liars... 
over smart...all the girls...

83
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:52,296
Difficult questions". 
can never understand you...

84
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,879
We are last and dazed... 
all because of you...

85
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:59,046
Never easy to go!...

86
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:02,296
But still I'm here for you...

87
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:05,261
We'll not trouble you anymore...

88
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:08,261
You're not the perfect match for us...

89
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:11,671
How long should we he after you? 
Your beauty kills...

90
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:15,675
Who wants to go on praise of 
beauty of moonlight in desert...

91
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:55,886
We are in love for quite 
some time now,

92
00:13:56,042 --> 00:13:57,009
girl friend is angry,

93
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:59,670
dun'! you've any thought 
of pacifying her.

94
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:03,049
We'll follow you till you fall for us, 
once fallen you're after us.

95
00:14:07,042 --> 00:14:11,047
Mother...father.. 
- What's it son?

96
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:17,675
You told me to introduce if I've 
any girl friend, she's the one.

97
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:21,760
I told about it just a couple 
of days ago, so fast?

98
00:14:21,917 --> 00:14:24,045
It's been going on for 
a year now, dad.

99
00:14:25,292 --> 00:14:27,044
When I was young like you,

100
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:30,751
I too though! of taking a girl to 
my dad and introduce her,

101
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:33,044
I couldn't and so married you.

102
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:36,421
I couldn't! do it, but he has done it.

103
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:40,126
My father is like that. 
- No, he isn't! that great.

104
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:44,502
When ever he does anything, he feels 
he also could've done it, that's all.

105
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:46,293
My mother is like this only.

106
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,002
You come in dear.

107
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:55,136
What! are your parents doing? 
- They are in America.

108
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:56,384
I'm doing engineering hers.

109
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:59,295
I'm with my paternal uncle 
and joined college here.

110
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,051
What's your plan after marriage? 
- Marry Krish.

111
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:17,919
Get up!

112
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:22,171
It's Krish, mom. 
- Get up, let's go to temple.

113
00:15:22,292 --> 00:15:24,920
Why should I come to temple? 
- Why are you asking like that son?

114
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,503
Why do we go to a temple? 
If we are facing any problem, we go.

115
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:30,136
Do I've any problem'? 
Good mother and father.

116
00:15:30,292 --> 00:15:31,794
Indu, who loves ms dearly.

117
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:33,794
My friends who would do 
anything for me.

118
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,423
Wealth that can last for many 
generations if spent lavishly.

119
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:39,754
If I still go to the temple with 
all this, God will feel bad.

120
00:15:47,042 --> 00:15:51,673
I need to meet you immediately. 
- What? - Problem.

121
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:03,009
Is the problem big?

122
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:04,793
Haw could you guess it right?

123
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,174
When you scratched me, 
it means the problem is big.

124
00:16:08,292 --> 00:16:09,168
Tell me.

125
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,127
I've a friend.

126
00:16:11,292 --> 00:16:13,670
Should I kidnap and get her married? 
- Listen to me fully.

127
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:17,260
She's very brilliant.

128
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:20,261
She has many ideas about her career.

129
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:24,047
She Finished studies here; she wants 
to study further in America.

130
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,503
She needs money? 
- Listen to me.

131
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:31,127
Her father wants to get her married 
to aunty's son in village.

132
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:32,919
He's a rogue.

133
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:37,297
If she marries him, her Iife is ruined.

134
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:43,549
To avoid that marriage, she told 
her father that she has a boy friend.

135
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:46,420
Good idea. 
- That's where she got caught.

136
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,174
Now her father wants to 
meet the boyfriend.

137
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,047
He's better than her.

138
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:57,630
She needs a boy Friend 
immediately to take home.

139
00:16:57,792 --> 00:17:00,136
Where can I get a 
scapegoat immediately?

140
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:01,794
Don'! say scapegoat.

141
00:17:01,917 --> 00:17:06,377
Okay, where can I get a hay 
friend for her immediately?

142
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,004
Oh no! Am I that scapegoat? 
Have you gone mad?

143
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,881
I should've understood 
when you scratched me.

144
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,843
Will you please leave her hand?

145
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:53,257
I've seen fathers, who send goons to 
bash him on knowing about boy friend,

146
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:57,255
but your father is inviting him 
like son-in-law for a festival...

147
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,093
Will he beat me there?

148
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,377
If we know that 
why would I choose you?

149
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,627
I would've sent any fool with her.

150
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:07,258
If you go, you'll settle it and 
return immediately in a jiffy.

151
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,631
Do you feel like that?

152
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,967
Good!

153
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,344
Can'! you escape to America from here?

154
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,504
She doesn't! want to hurt her father.

155
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,251
That sentiment too!

156
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,127
She thinks her lather mustn't get hurt,

157
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,502
and you think she mustn't get hurl,

158
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,127
and I think you mustn't get hurl,

159
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,719
okay, what next'!

160
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,718
Will you be happy if I go with her?

161
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:42,335
You're the only girl to send your boy 
friend as boy friend of your friend.

162
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,251
Good!

163
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,969
Okay...what will you tell your parents?

164
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:50,130
I always told my dad after doing it, 
this one also.

165
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:51,630
When are we leaving?

166
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:55,629
Tell me son!

167
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,507
Dad, I'm thinking of going 
on a world tour.-Why?

168
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,128
You didn't! go, so I'm thinking of going.

169
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,877
When are you leaving? 
- Tomorrow, dad.

170
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:08,383
The kid embarked on journey...

171
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:13,883
Innocent kid...

172
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,334
I can see clearly the tumultuous future.

173
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,585
How many brothers and 
sisters you have?

174
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,378
I'm the lone child. 
- Oh like me!

175
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,632
Sc, you, mother and father in home! 
I can manage easily.

176
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,378
There are 20 people in my home. 
- What?

177
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,968
Mine is joint family.

178
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,752
Oh my God!

179
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,629
My father Bhanuprasad.

180
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:49,254
My mother died two years 
after I was born.

181
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:53,338
People say my father 
became tough after that.

182
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,709
Nat only people in home but 
entire village is afraid of my father.

183
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,127
His word is rule.

184
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:02,713
He'll not leave if he likes, 
if he dislikes, he ignores.

185
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:06,004
Till now my lather never talked 
to me affectionately, Krish.

186
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:10,755
I'm waiting eagerly that 
he will some day..

187
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,380
This is my family photo.

188
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,587
It's like school photo with principal.

189
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:22,258
My elder uncle Prasad Rao, 
he loves playing cards,

190
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,631
my elder aunt Mahalakshmi,

191
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,006
their sun Chilli,

192
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:28,755
younger uncle Giri,

193
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,128
he came here 15 years ago 
for harvest festival,

194
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,594
he always says he'll go 
after next festival,

195
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,468
my younger aunt Shravani,

196
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:39,630
my uncles who are intern sans-in-law 
are cheap to every one..

197
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,253
My elder paternal uncle and aunt,

198
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:46,084
my younger paternal uncle and aunt, 
and their kids,

199
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,877
this is my pet Kittu.

200
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:52,759
Though I said casually scapegoat, 
this is lndu's plan, right?

201
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,461
No, my grandpa's.

202
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:59,380
She has many dreams, she wants to 
study further and achieve something,

203
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,632
why do you want her to marry 
and stay at home?

204
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,128
Moreover with that rogue. 
- What does he lack?

205
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:08,462
If we search we can find a 
defect in every man, father.

206
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:13,255
I haven't forgotten the promise given 
to sister about giving land to her son.

207
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,378
Why are you worried 
when my daughter isn't, father?

208
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:21,589
Neither you nor I... 
- What?- She has...

209
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,503
It seems she loves a boy in city.

210
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:30,212
Old fox! You've made a very big plan.

211
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,343
The old man is there only, right?

212
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,003
I can manage all of them easily.

213
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,843
But what is in your lather's mind?

214
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:42,834
It seems the groom is coming, 
when is the marriage?

215
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,503
You didn't! even tell your 
sister's husband also.

216
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:48,006
I'm not calling him here 
to marry my daughter,

217
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,127
to sand him away from hers.

218
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,584
When my daughter said she loves a boy, 
if I say no and create scene,

219
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:59,504
she may elope with him 
as she's major.

220
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:04,505
She's young and alone without 
any family support there,

221
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:07,131
he would've charmed her 
with his word play,

222
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,503
and this mad girl thinks that's Iove,

223
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:11,843
that's why I told her to bring him here,

224
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,718
we are so many here,

225
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:18,209
can't we make him hate us and 
go away from here on his own?

226
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:20,881
Can't I divert my daughter's 
attention towards us?

227
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:26,759
It means we don'! like him, right? 
- That's what he's saying.

228
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:29,006
Just checking if you'd 
understood it or not.

229
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,002
One thing is sure,

230
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:33,460
as I had promised my sister,

231
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:36,503
my daughter will become 
your daughter-in-law.

232
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,876
Ha's coming.

233
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:41,504
Let him come.

234
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:44,211
Vankalapuram 3 kms.

235
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:53,381
Bomb...bomb...

236
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,584
It's not a bomb but bus tyre.

237
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:01,586
Flat tyre in this village.

238
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,843
Why are you getting down in this village?

239
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,218
How dare he's getting down here!

240
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:28,584
How dare a man from that 
village gets down here!

241
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:41,757
A man from that village 
has beaten our man.

242
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:52,469
Stay away from the people 
of thls village, let's go Krish.

243
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,752
You don't know about the 
people of this village.

244
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,002
Who... 
~

245
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,210
You? Why'? 
- Bus stopped and I got down.

246
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,469
I was lighting the cigarette, 
he caught me by my collar,

247
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:32,377
I didn't! like it. I heat him.

248
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:35,757
Do you know what would've happened 
if had come a minute late?

249
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:38,094
Another 10 people would be 
unconscious like him.

250
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:43,879
Whose guest you are there? 
- Bhanuprasad.

251
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:51,256
Is that why you're so proud? 
Buys! Tie him!

252
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:57,261
Let me who will come to release 
that bus and this boy. Come on.

253
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,376
Brother!

254
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:06,007
It seems they've stopped the 
bus coming to our village.

255
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:08,630
Stop bays!

256
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:17,713
You may think you've escaped, 
you've to return in this road only.

257
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:24,001
Mahbubnagar district limit ends

258
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,501
Kurnool district limit begins

259
00:25:30,875 --> 00:25:35,881
The man who is scared to face you 
is daring to come to you.

260
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,378
He's going extreme, brother-in-law.

261
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,377
Junior madam is here!

262
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,753
Grandpa, madam is hers.

263
00:26:57,875 --> 00:26:59,343
How are you doing, aunt?

264
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:05,131
Uncle! Rummy or drop?

265
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,504
Grandpa! Greetings grandpa!

266
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:16,003
Watch, how I'll play with him.

267
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:21,132
It seems you got dawn in that 
village and beat a man there.

268
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:23,585
Ara you such a courageous man?

269
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:28,256
You've told everything about me, 
it'll not be nice if I say again.

270
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:31,378
What's your name'? 
- Krishna, my fathers choice.

271
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,835
It's little old, so changed it to Krish. 
- What does your father do?

272
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,219
In the big conglomerate Krishna 
group of companies,

273
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:41,754
he's a small clerk. 
- Are you a clerk's sun?-Yes.

274
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:47,005
Why did you choose my daughter 
though city boasts of many girls?

275
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:48,377
Why did you ask ms like that?

276
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,002
There are so many fathers in this world,

277
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:52,381
if I ask why have you become 
father of the girl I love,

278
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,218
what will be your answer, sir?

279
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,967
Smart boy!

280
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:00,719
What do you do? 
- Not yet decided.

281
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:04,376
How could you like him?

282
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:07,632
There can he reasons for disliking, 
why do you need reasons to like?

283
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,877
He can answer only it he knows it.

284
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,343
Take him in.

285
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,252
Come Krish.

286
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:47,628
Krish, this room...

287
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:49,756
I understood it while talking 
to your father.

288
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:51,756
How the treatment will be here.

289
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:55,383
For my father talking to you like that...

290
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,877
Haw do you expect him to talk to me then?

291
00:28:58,208 --> 00:29:01,758
I've raised my daughter for you only, 
come and take, would he say so?

292
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:05,094
Father of any daughter would 
talk like your father only.

293
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:09,092
Little hard.

294
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,969
Am I your original lover to feel for it?

295
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:15,629
But one thing, I was always happy 
and in happy surroundings only.

296
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:19,254
First time I'm seeing hatred. 
Let me experience that too.

297
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,627
By the way, why are you so dull?

298
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,629
Do you know how my girl friend must be?

299
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:28,256
Do you know this? 
My father always says,

300
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:30,961
I'm the most handsome eligible 
bachelor in this stale.

301
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:32,843
If ifs not true, 
why would he say?

302
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,342
I think he's right.

303
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:38,253
That's better! That's how people 
should be with me.

304
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:41,754
How many hurdles I had crossed? 
Can't you thank me?

305
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:44,628
Girl friends will not thank boyfriends.

306
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:47,962
Oh good development.

307
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:52,130
We met entire family, 
but where is he?- Who'!

308
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:55,837
For whom I've came here, 
your aunt's son.

309
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:04,758
If your sister is pregnant, 
how can you say it's mine?

310
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:07,628
She got cheated with 
a promise of marriage-:...

311
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:13,338
I wanted Bhumi before 
I grew a mustache.

312
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,879
Everyone here knows 
I'll marry her only.

313
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,879
But still your sister slept with me,

314
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:29,843
I can take it as she desired me, 
how can I think she loves me?

315
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:34,880
You should've come to you for this,

316
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,004
why did you try to go 
to my father-in-law?

317
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:43,006
Get her abort it in another village,

318
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:49,261
if not your wife who goes to latch 
water daily will not return home.

319
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:51,961
Your children who go to 
school will also...

320
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,001
Brother!

321
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:57,381
There's man here to see you.

322
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:06,001
Who are you?

323
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,877
I heard about you and imagined wrong,

324
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,219
you're much better. 
- Who are you?

325
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:16,379
In a way, I'm your younger brother.

326
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:20,258
I mean you future wile's 
future husband.

327
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,379
Hey, you've committed a mistake.

328
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:34,712
You should've inquired about me 
before coming here.

329
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:41,087
I'll let people know about me, 
I'll never bother to know about others.

330
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:49,882
The moment I reach Bhumi's home, 
I know you'll come to show your power.

331
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:54,258
Before that happens, 
I must show you my power, right?

332
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:59,006
Listen to me and forget Bhumi.

333
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:03,634
I know it's little difficult, brother. 
But do try!

334
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,752
You can't avoid it, right?

335
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,252
Bhumi, come.

336
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:24,876
Leave me, father.

337
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:31,963
You may misjudge me as 
soft lover boy from city,

338
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:34,753
just made a try as the 
character is new,

339
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:36,877
the original is intact inside,

340
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,506
it you make it come cut, 
it's devastation only!

341
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,877
Why did you stop me, father?

342
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,503
I would've killed him as 
she watches it.

343
00:32:56,125 --> 00:33:01,336
Till now whatever we had done, 
we did it secretly behind your uncle,

344
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:06,131
your uncle promised me, 
he'll take care of him.

345
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,093
Come in grandpa.

346
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,503
You thought about your 
grand daughter's life only,

347
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:23,380
you didn't bother about a 
scapegoat's life getting stuck.

348
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:33,005
What's this grandpa?

349
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:35,881
Fear...fear dear.

350
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:44,002
I just thought what would've happened 
to her life if you hadn't come?

351
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:48,209
We all joined together to raise 
a motherless child,

352
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:51,503
but nobody could become 
mother to her.

353
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:58,212
As her name suggests, she hid 
everything inside like earth,

354
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:00,843
never shared it with anyone.

355
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,880
She told me about everyone in 
this home before coming here,

356
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:07,252
only you've told me about her, grandpa.

357
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:11,175
There are so many here, 
won't he listen to your advise too?

358
00:34:11,292 --> 00:34:17,004
Let any mistake happen here, 
nobody here would dare point it.

359
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:20,379
Because they think they're 
don't have that right.

360
00:34:20,917 --> 00:34:22,544
May be I ton!

361
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:28,302
You saw on the bride about people 
of two villages breathing fire to fight,

362
00:34:28,417 --> 00:34:29,919
I'm responsible for it.

363
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:34,047
Though their mothers are different, 
their father is one.

364
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,548
I'm their father.

365
00:34:41,917 --> 00:34:44,295
Are they both your sans?

366
00:34:46,917 --> 00:34:51,002
You came fur my grand daughter 
but I'm telling you my talc.

367
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:53,169
Forget about that, grandson.

368
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:57,001
You said your father is sums clerk,

369
00:34:57,167 --> 00:35:01,297
you would've lived in narrow lanes 
and match box like homes,

370
00:35:02,042 --> 00:35:06,878
did you see haw vast the house is? 
I built it.

371
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,550
Stay happily till you are hers.

372
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:14,050
Keep this Rs.500, for expenses.

373
00:35:14,167 --> 00:35:17,011
Ask me if you need more, 
don'! feel shy.

374
00:35:20,917 --> 00:35:24,296
You tuck Rs.500 from grandpa, 
how much you tuck from Bhumi?

375
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,672
Hey you!

376
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,172
Are you a hired son-in-law?

377
00:35:31,292 --> 00:35:36,173
But why are they making so 
many plans to drive you cut?

378
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:40,547
Brother! 
- Hey, how dare you touch me!

379
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:43,170
If I twist your hand will break.

380
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:45,922
Brother, that's an imported watch.

381
00:35:46,042 --> 00:35:48,420
If ifs imported watch, 
won't it work on my hand?

382
00:35:48,542 --> 00:35:51,421
One punch can break your heart 
into 16 pieces.

383
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,297
Come here boy!

384
00:35:53,792 --> 00:35:56,921
What will happen to you ll uncle 
comes to know about this?

385
00:35:57,042 --> 00:35:59,044
No brother, I'll be dead.

386
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,251
Brother, that's my shirt.

387
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:03,671
One punch on nose will drain 
out your entire blood.

388
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,877
Pack everything.

389
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,048
What am I to pack after 
you've packed everything?

390
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,669
How dare you raise voice on me!

391
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:12,673
I'll pluck your eyes balls and 
play marbles with it.

392
00:36:12,792 --> 00:36:15,921
Maintaining glamor too? 
Du you really need it?

393
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:19,629
You'll stay here for one night only. 
Uncle won't come till morning.

394
00:36:19,792 --> 00:36:23,422
Uncle won't come till morning!

395
00:36:23,542 --> 00:36:27,627
Hey kid! You pack everything. 
Pack everything.

396
00:36:33,917 --> 00:36:35,919
Sleep...how could you sleep hay?

397
00:36:36,042 --> 00:36:37,544
I told you to pack your bags, right?

398
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,879
Brother, last night I went out 
to shout a film.

399
00:36:41,042 --> 00:36:42,259
What did you see in darkness?

400
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:43,760
I filmed everything I could see, brother.

401
00:36:43,917 --> 00:36:45,544
Why don'! you Elm me? 
Come on...

402
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:46,668
I've already shot! your film, brother.

403
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:47,876
Am I appearing smart? 
Am I handsome?

404
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:53,047
I'd he more handsome than you. 
Show me...show me...

405
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:59,053
Rathalu...Iook what I've got you 
from Dubai?

406
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:01,761
Scent bottles and powder cans?

407
00:37:01,917 --> 00:37:05,046
Wait for two days, 
I found a scapegoat,

408
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:08,424
as soon as uncle comes,
I'll uncle about him,

409
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:12,880
and rice mill will become ours. 
After that it's fun all the way.

410
00:37:15,042 --> 00:37:16,544
My fate brother!

411
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,920
Pant is over-sized. 
Keep it.

412
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:21,044
Imported watch brother, keep it safely.

413
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:29,547
Hey! You underestimated me, kid!

414
00:37:30,292 --> 00:37:34,126
What's this'? 
- Thai film is on this CD.

415
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:36,419
I've about 30 or 40 copies of it.

416
00:37:43,417 --> 00:37:45,761
I think I've handled Chitti little tough.

417
00:37:45,917 --> 00:37:48,796
Useless Chilli no need lo talk about him

418
00:37:48,917 --> 00:37:52,421
Will your punch break 
my heart into 16...

419
00:37:53,292 --> 00:37:56,171
Pluck my eye balls and play marbles... 
- Oh no, forget it.

420
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:59,174
A punch an nose will drain out... 
- Forget it.

421
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:01,377
Will you aver act? 
- I've stopped it, brother.

422
00:38:01,542 --> 00:38:02,168
Brother!

423
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:05,424
If my matter leaks out not only 
from you or anyone else,

424
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:08,421
I'll release this film, 
'kaihalu and Rice Mill'.

425
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:09,793
I got it, brother.

426
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,799
From now your tensions 
are my tensions..

427
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:16,299
You were asking for uncle 
since last night, he has returned.

428
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:29,922
Come fast!

429
00:38:38,042 --> 00:38:40,795
I called you like that to make 
them believe us as lovers.

430
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,796
Is it good'!

431
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:47,294
Is it the way to call a lover, Krish?

432
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,252
Didn't you feel like that?

433
00:38:49,417 --> 00:38:51,795
But your friend always 
calls me informally.

434
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,550
I must keep her under 
control immediately.

435
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,049
Okay, come and have breakfast.

436
00:39:02,042 --> 00:39:06,047
You're good in lung skirt and half sari.

437
00:39:08,542 --> 00:39:10,294
Okay come.

438
00:39:10,542 --> 00:39:11,919
How long to wait!

439
00:39:14,625 --> 00:39:16,172
Come brother, sit!.

440
00:39:16,292 --> 00:39:16,633
Is it fear or humbleness?

441
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:19,794
It's respect with humbleness 
and fear, brother.

442
00:39:19,917 --> 00:39:20,668
Si! down.

443
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,173
Just two dosas only for you.

444
00:39:27,292 --> 00:39:29,670
This plate is not fur strangers. 
For members of the family only.

445
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:34,376
Mahalakshmi aunty, 
she'll fall easily for praise.

446
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:41,132
A Goddess like you're here but 
Bhumi praised someone else.

447
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:42,384
Whom did she praise?

448
00:39:42,542 --> 00:39:50,051
Her name starts with Ma...Maha... 
- Mahalakshmi?

449
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:50,796
That's her!

450
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,800
I dun'! like praising her 
when you are here.

451
00:40:00,292 --> 00:40:01,919
What! else did she tell you? 
- Changed the plate.

452
00:40:02,042 --> 00:40:03,259
She told me a lot.

453
00:40:03,417 --> 00:40:06,421
Whether anyone likes me or not, 
but Mahalakshmi must like me.

454
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:07,759
I don't! know it she'll like me or not.

455
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:10,544
Son! 
- No mother!

456
00:40:10,667 --> 00:40:11,759
Yes?

457
00:40:12,167 --> 00:40:13,919
That! Mahalakshmi...

458
00:40:14,917 --> 00:40:15,543
...it's me!

459
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,421
You7

460
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:19,170
You? Are you Mahalakshmi?

461
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,922
How dare!

462
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:22,798
How dare she makes you 
serve breakfast to me?

463
00:40:22,917 --> 00:40:25,921
Please sit down son...sit down.

464
00:40:26,292 --> 00:40:28,294
What's it Krish? 
- You wait.

465
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,629
You have your breakfast, 
I'll be back in a minute.

466
00:40:31,917 --> 00:40:37,424
Oh no! You're no ordinary actor. 
- What?- Actor par excellence!

467
00:40:37,542 --> 00:40:38,293
What's it aunt?

468
00:40:38,417 --> 00:40:42,752
Whether anyone likes him or not, 
I like him very much.

469
00:40:42,917 --> 00:40:44,794
Please don't tell anyone that I like him.

470
00:40:44,917 --> 00:40:47,887
Krish wait, I'll gs! you two more dosas.

471
00:40:49,375 --> 00:40:53,175
Sir, bulls have grown old. 
No use at all.

472
00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:54,171
What! shall I do, sir?

473
00:40:54,292 --> 00:40:56,886
They worked till now for this family.

474
00:40:57,417 --> 00:41:02,127
There are many here who eat 
and do nothing for this family.

475
00:41:02,292 --> 00:41:04,294
Feed it along with {hem.

476
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,127
Brother, he told about us only, right?

477
00:41:08,292 --> 00:41:11,011
Any doubt? By any chance 
will you get angry and leave?

478
00:41:11,167 --> 00:41:14,671
You can go if you wan to, how can 
I go with Dasara festival near by?

479
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:22,298
Place is good, uncle. 
Good selection.

480
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,547
What are you doing here? Get up.

481
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:24,876
Why are you saying like that?

482
00:41:25,042 --> 00:41:26,885
I must also settle here 
some day like you, uncle.

483
00:41:27,042 --> 00:41:29,170
Let's share this place between us. 
- What'?

484
00:41:29,375 --> 00:41:30,547
I've also decided after seeing you, uncle.

485
00:41:30,667 --> 00:41:33,295
I'll also become intern son-in-law.

486
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,751
What In do now?

487
00:41:36,917 --> 00:41:40,672
II he comes, he'll he star son-in-law 
and we'll be extra sons-in-law.

488
00:41:40,792 --> 00:41:42,294
What! shall we do now? 
- Let's (rap him.

489
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:43,794
How? 
- Shut up.

490
00:41:45,292 --> 00:41:49,547
Lock, nobody will talk to you here 
other than we two.

491
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:52,128
Ask me what aver you want. 
- Okay uncle.

492
00:41:52,917 --> 00:41:54,043
Brother-in-law.

493
00:41:57,125 --> 00:42:00,629
Brother-in-law! He didn't care our warnings 
and sat between us.

494
00:42:00,792 --> 00:42:04,376
I can judge what he is when he 
came uninvited wagging to you.

495
00:42:05,292 --> 00:42:07,294
Be careful. 
- Okay brother-in-law.

496
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:16,546
Grandson, don't take it your heart.

497
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:20,046
Are you feeling for it? 
I'm telling you don't do it.

498
00:42:20,167 --> 00:42:23,046
You don't worry, grandpa, 
these little things won't hurt me.

499
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:26,550
Now that I'm here, 
I'll finish the job and go.

500
00:42:27,792 --> 00:42:29,260
Oh no! My dad!

501
00:42:29,542 --> 00:42:31,795
Where are you now son? 
- Where am I'!

502
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,752
I'm in South Africa, dad.

503
00:42:33,917 --> 00:42:38,172
There's a big zoo known 
as National Safari,

504
00:42:38,292 --> 00:42:40,044
you can find different kinds of animals,

505
00:42:40,167 --> 00:42:41,885
you wouldn't have seen them in your Iife.

506
00:42:48,917 --> 00:42:50,260
You're right dad.

507
00:42:50,417 --> 00:42:52,385
I've never seen so many 
varieties cf animals.

508
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:55,261
They are fine...I mean good.

509
00:42:56,042 --> 00:42:57,419
Miss you too, dad.

510
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:07,796
My father thinks I'm on world tour.

511
00:43:07,917 --> 00:43:10,420
You haven't yet given me 
a tour of your village.

512
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:14,423
Lat's go out.

513
00:43:16,417 --> 00:43:18,169
Entire farm you see is ours.

514
00:43:18,292 --> 00:43:22,251
If I'm here to take you and 
this vast property,

515
00:43:22,417 --> 00:43:25,170
not only your father, 
any father would feel sad.

516
00:43:28,917 --> 00:43:30,385
Shall we drink palm milk?

517
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:51,501
Tender leaves swayed gently...

518
00:43:51,667 --> 00:43:58,175
The young maiden's heart 
too swayed, 0 parrot...

519
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:14,420
Jasmine says yes...it's fragrance of 
jasmine in eye, heart, soul and on me...

520
00:44:14,542 --> 00:44:19,503
It's tempting and 
spread all around me...

521
00:44:19,667 --> 00:44:25,674
It's beautiful jasmine...

522
00:44:26,042 --> 00:44:32,505
Sun...hot young sun like man... 
has come to my village...

523
00:44:32,667 --> 00:44:39,425
Rad sun...young sun...has driven 
away darkness from my life...

524
00:44:39,625 --> 00:44:46,133
It never happened like this before... 
sky has become shadow of earth....

525
00:44:46,292 --> 00:44:51,674
That savvy young man would've 
filled the sky with light...

526
00:44:55,500 --> 00:45:01,883
Hey boy, it's our day, take chances". 
this place is all ours...

527
00:45:02,042 --> 00:45:08,880

00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:56,800
These legs know to dance".

531
00:45:56,917 --> 00:45:59,796
It realised after you came into my life...

532
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,550
This flower knows to smile...

533
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:07,129
It laughed after knowing about you...

534
00:46:07,292 --> 00:46:10,171
Oh God! What! happened to this maiden?

535
00:46:10,375 --> 00:46:13,800
She's teasing and 
spreading her charm...

536
00:46:13,917 --> 00:46:17,046
Even stones would talk 
if ifs with you...

537
00:46:17,167 --> 00:46:19,670
What! am I to do, tell me dear?

538
00:46:20,542 --> 00:46:22,920
Hay boy, make the sky bend 
down for you...

539
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:26,425
Hey boy, make the evening 
dance to your tunes...

540
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:33,300
Hay boy, let the colours enchant". 
go all out for it...

541
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:40,299
He came courageously. 
he stood by ground".

542
00:46:41,292 --> 00:46:47,299
He charmed...he moved...

543
00:47:14,667 --> 00:47:17,921
Those eyes are making merry...

544
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:21,129
It's happy only after hearing you...

545
00:47:21,292 --> 00:47:24,421
Those steps are turning mischievous...

546
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:28,172
Your sung is inspiring and 
excitement is hitting crescendo...

547
00:47:28,292 --> 00:47:31,375
What am I to say if you 
attribute everything to me?

548
00:47:31,542 --> 00:47:34,671
May be you all together and 
created this wonder...

549
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:40,882
You created this magic, if you say 
we did it, what am I to say?

550
00:47:41,042 --> 00:47:44,046
Hey boy, rack this place...

551
00:47:44,167 --> 00:47:47,671
Hey boy, shatter the world...

552
00:47:47,875 --> 00:47:53,882
Hay boy, shake up the nature". 
smash it out...

553
00:48:15,167 --> 00:48:18,421
The paddy pods have opened up...

554
00:48:18,542 --> 00:48:24,424
The swallow has reached 
it's nest, 0 parrot...

555
00:48:26,292 --> 00:48:30,547
Now I know why you like 
Kittu, the tortoise.- Why?

556
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:34,926
It too hides the head 
on facing danger.

557
00:48:35,042 --> 00:48:38,296
It's free and happy when 
there's no one around.

558
00:48:38,417 --> 00:48:39,543
Just like you.

559
00:48:50,542 --> 00:48:55,423
Your stay here is very short, so do look 
around as much as you can.

560
00:48:55,625 --> 00:48:57,878
Are you sending us marrying off'?

561
00:48:58,042 --> 00:49:01,501
If uncle wasn't! between us, 
I would've killed you by now.

562
00:49:01,667 --> 00:49:07,424
BIoody...women are here, brother. 
Nut nice to use bad words.

563
00:49:07,917 --> 00:49:09,544
May I tell you one thing, brother?

564
00:49:09,667 --> 00:49:12,295
He's a man, who kills when he wants to,

565
00:49:12,667 --> 00:49:15,921
if I want to, no power on 
earth can stop me.

566
00:49:17,167 --> 00:49:19,295
Bhumi, come.

567
00:49:33,375 --> 00:49:34,797
Ha's finished today.

568
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:39,129
This is not city to roam around 
with an unmarried girl.

569
00:49:39,292 --> 00:49:40,259
This is village.

570
00:49:40,417 --> 00:49:42,294
Don'! you've sense that people 
would be watching you?

571
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:47,301
It's you who brought me here before 
marriage and announced it to all.

572
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:49,797
Ha's right.

573
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,176
Don't you've the knowledge to 
inform us before taking her out?

574
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:59,005
Accusing you is waste, 
ifs your pan-:nts' mistake.

575
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:04,919
Brother!

576
00:50:05,292 --> 00:50:06,885
Didn't you tell them'?

577
00:50:08,042 --> 00:50:09,544
What?

578
00:50:09,667 --> 00:50:12,637
You both are lovers, 
why are you sitting in home?

579
00:50:12,792 --> 00:50:16,672
Ga out happily like love birds, and 
said you'll manage uncle, right?

580
00:50:16,875 --> 00:50:18,047
Didn't you do it?

581
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,924
Oh! Did I say like that?

582
00:50:25,917 --> 00:50:27,510
Did you'!

583
00:50:27,667 --> 00:50:31,797
That is father". 
if you ask me did I...

584
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,377
Why is he staring at me?

585
00:50:34,042 --> 00:50:37,421
If brother says it means I've said it.

586
00:50:50,792 --> 00:50:53,136
Did you expect I'll go away with this?

587
00:50:53,292 --> 00:50:56,262
Not expect, I've already packed 
your bags, brother.

588
00:50:56,417 --> 00:51:00,672
Give me a minute, I'll unload it. 
Promise on my mother.

589
00:51:00,792 --> 00:51:02,294
Who is calling at this hour, brother'?

590
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:05,549
My real girl friend, I'll talk to her.

591
00:51:08,667 --> 00:51:10,169
Why am I knowing all the truths?

592
00:51:10,375 --> 00:51:11,627
Have you settled down?

593
00:51:11,792 --> 00:51:13,920
You want me to? 
- I'll kill you.

594
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:17,049
I meant no problem. 
- No problem.

595
00:51:17,167 --> 00:51:20,922
Why don't you also come here 
as Bhumi's friend? It'll be fun.

596
00:51:21,042 --> 00:51:25,127
.just 10 days only, I'll tell about us 
with my parents after exams.

597
00:51:25,292 --> 00:51:28,626
Alter that all my life is 
with you only.

598
00:51:28,917 --> 00:51:30,919
Okay, I'll call you tomorrow.

599
00:51:35,667 --> 00:51:36,293
Got a joker?

600
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,298
Come early tomorrow morning.

601
00:51:38,417 --> 00:51:40,636
Spray fertilizers in the Farm 
- Yes sir.

602
00:51:40,792 --> 00:51:44,422
There's a marriage at Basavarajus, 
we're busy so can't attend,

603
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:48,004
anyway you both are idle, 
have a free feast there.

604
00:51:48,167 --> 00:51:50,886
We'll save atleast a meal here.

605
00:51:55,417 --> 00:51:56,134
He's here again.

606
00:51:56,292 --> 00:52:00,126
Why is he calling so cheaply, uncle'? 
- Who else? We both.

607
00:52:00,292 --> 00:52:02,294
What's this uncle? 
You're his sister's husband, right?

608
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,002
How can he address brother-in-law 
with disrespect?

609
00:52:04,167 --> 00:52:05,794
That's it. 
- I didn't like it, uncle.

610
00:52:05,917 --> 00:52:07,635
This is unjust, 
come let's lake him to task.

611
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:10,636
What! task? They'll throw us 
also out with you.

612
00:52:10,792 --> 00:52:12,886
You're too much. 
- What's this uncle?

613
00:52:13,042 --> 00:52:15,295
Agreed we are useless, 
idle and do nothing,

614
00:52:15,417 --> 00:52:17,294
can he abuse us like that? 
- He's wrong.

615
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,501
Now the...

616
00:52:19,167 --> 00:52:22,626
What's this? Suns-in-laws are talking 
here, can't you do it later?

617
00:52:22,792 --> 00:52:24,419
Go away. 
- I've lot of work to do.

618
00:52:24,542 --> 00:52:26,169
You go inside and talk.

619
00:52:28,042 --> 00:52:29,294
Did you see uncle'?

620
00:52:29,875 --> 00:52:32,298
Ha's working, right? That's his proud.

621
00:52:32,417 --> 00:52:34,886
He's not insensitive like us, uncle.

622
00:52:35,042 --> 00:52:36,259
Ha's passing comments 
without thinking.

623
00:52:36,417 --> 00:52:39,170
Because if we fire him,

624
00:52:39,375 --> 00:52:43,676
he's confident of earning livelihood by 
working elsewhere if not here, uncle.

625
00:52:45,042 --> 00:52:50,048
Father, come. Food is ready. 
Let's have food, come.

626
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,379
As your son, taking you as rule model, 
he'll become like you only,

627
00:52:54,542 --> 00:52:56,385
How can he come good in life, uncle?

628
00:52:57,292 --> 00:53:01,172
Find a home for him also like you, 
he'll also live a miserable life like you.

629
00:53:02,167 --> 00:53:06,422
Not many more years Ieft, already 
spent a good part of life, uncle,

630
00:53:06,542 --> 00:53:07,794
few more years and we'll be gone,

631
00:53:07,917 --> 00:53:09,260
those useless guys are dead,

632
00:53:09,417 --> 00:53:12,045
reduced the burden of earth,

633
00:53:12,167 --> 00:53:15,011
without shedding a tear, 
they'll dump us,

634
00:53:15,167 --> 00:53:17,044
we'll nut he there to feel 
bad about it, right?

635
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:18,297
What! do you say?

636
00:53:18,417 --> 00:53:20,169
Let's spend our lives like this, uncle.

637
00:53:20,375 --> 00:53:24,755
Till this sit out is there, there's 
nothing to worry about life, uncle.

638
00:53:24,917 --> 00:53:25,884
Bye uncle.

639
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:36,923
But uncle, I'm sure about one thing,

640
00:53:37,417 --> 00:53:41,297
instead of people asking 
what a miserable life they had,

641
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,423
after death its better they ask, 
what a great life they had!

642
00:53:43,542 --> 00:53:46,170
Try to live like that, uncle.

643
00:53:47,667 --> 00:53:49,169
Your Iife will also have a meaning.

644
00:53:59,667 --> 00:54:02,261
Where is the tractor with fertilizers?

645
00:54:02,417 --> 00:54:04,044
They've gone, sir. 
- Who'?

646
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:08,551
Both sons-in-law have gone to the 
farm with tractor early morning.

647
00:54:11,292 --> 00:54:13,169
Did they go to farm?

648
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:14,635
Did my husband goto the farm?

649
00:54:14,792 --> 00:54:16,794
What? Did he goto farm?

650
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,253
Have both sons-in-law gone to work?

651
00:54:23,792 --> 00:54:25,794
Sons-in-law have come hack.

652
00:54:47,875 --> 00:54:52,176
We've finished the Farm near the pond,

653
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:58,174
I don'! think the stock is enough, 
get another load of fertilizers.

654
00:55:04,917 --> 00:55:06,169
Okay brother-in-law.

655
00:55:16,917 --> 00:55:22,503
There were fewer coolies, 
check and pay them.

656
00:55:29,542 --> 00:55:32,671
You check and pay them 
yourself, brother-in-law.

657
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:52,547
What's this aunty?

658
00:55:53,667 --> 00:55:55,635
Though I'm smiling for this world,

659
00:55:56,292 --> 00:55:58,670
this is my real lace.

660
00:55:59,625 --> 00:56:04,552
It's very difficult to hide 
years of despair and sorrow.

661
00:56:09,042 --> 00:56:11,044
My aunts are very happy.

662
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:15,377
I know you're responsible for this. 
Why?- For you.

663
00:56:17,167 --> 00:56:22,048
Though you've so many people around, 
you've come a stranger for help,

664
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:24,753
do you know the situation 
in which you're living?

665
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,675
Though the house is named 
as Brindavanam outside,

666
00:56:29,792 --> 00:56:32,170
people inside are living 
as individuals inside,

667
00:56:33,667 --> 00:56:37,422
it you need any help in future, 
you mustn't turn to people like me,

668
00:56:37,542 --> 00:56:42,048
your maternal and paternal uncles 
and aunts must stand by you,

669
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:44,673
if it has to happen, 
they must change,

670
00:56:46,292 --> 00:56:48,545
when I came here, 
I knew only one thing,

671
00:56:48,667 --> 00:56:50,761
to stop your marriage 
with your aunt's son,

672
00:56:51,042 --> 00:56:54,421
if I thought that was it, 
I would've done it and left by now.

673
00:56:54,542 --> 00:56:57,295
But you want your lather 
to stop this marriage.

674
00:56:57,417 --> 00:57:00,296
That's what you want, 
if it has to happen,

675
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:01,919
your father must change, Bhumi.

676
00:57:03,292 --> 00:57:06,626
My father will not change, 
you can't do it.

677
00:57:06,792 --> 00:57:08,009
This home can do it.

678
00:57:10,792 --> 00:57:12,920
Do you think it'll happen, Krish?

679
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:14,923
How can you he so discouraging? 
I'm making a sincere effort.

680
00:57:16,125 --> 00:57:17,672
Can't you be little encouraging?

681
00:57:24,917 --> 00:57:27,670
Sn, you're on the job.

682
00:57:29,167 --> 00:57:31,044
Cams grandson.

683
00:57:35,167 --> 00:57:35,884
Would you like to have a drink?

684
00:57:36,042 --> 00:57:39,171
I do but rarely when I'm disturbed.

685
00:57:39,542 --> 00:57:44,002
Me too! That's why I drink every nigh!.

686
00:57:44,667 --> 00:57:45,509
What! happened grandpa?

687
00:57:45,667 --> 00:57:51,299
My sans have not shared 
just the property but me too.

688
00:57:52,125 --> 00:57:55,049
They can't cut an share ms, right?

689
00:57:55,417 --> 00:57:58,921
So I'm 6 months here 
and 6 months there.

690
00:58:00,542 --> 00:58:07,380
6 months are over, I'm going to 
younger son's home tomorrow.

691
00:58:08,542 --> 00:58:11,261
What happened, grandson? 
- What else?

692
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:15,175
Elder son couldn't take hear 
my second marriage,

693
00:58:15,292 --> 00:58:17,169
after few days younger son was born,

694
00:58:17,292 --> 00:58:21,627
as time New away, the distance 
between them also grew far,

695
00:58:21,792 --> 00:58:29,381
after that my eldest son-in-law 
turned this distance into enmity,

696
00:58:31,417 --> 00:58:35,672
younger son in that village, 
elder sun in this village,

697
00:58:36,042 --> 00:58:44,883
I'm living like this with memories 
of that place and this place.

698
00:58:47,375 --> 00:58:52,302
Cool grandpa, just 6 months only, 
it'll fly away in a jiffy.

699
00:58:54,167 --> 00:58:56,044
I'll dis there only.

700
00:59:08,167 --> 00:59:11,137
Grandpa! 
- Calm down dear.

701
00:59:15,917 --> 00:59:20,878
Don't think I'm repeating 
the same words again,

702
00:59:21,667 --> 00:59:26,753
it I die there, keep your enmity 
and prestige aside,

703
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:28,752
come without fail.

704
00:59:29,917 --> 00:59:36,050
Because as elder son 
you must cremate me.

705
00:59:52,292 --> 00:59:53,509
Hey grandson!

706
00:59:55,417 --> 00:59:58,261
Why are you coming there? 
- You brought me here, grandpa.

707
00:59:58,417 --> 00:59:59,634
How can you leave me alone there?

708
00:59:59,792 --> 01:00:03,626
Nu, my elder son is waiting 
for an opportunity,

709
01:00:03,792 --> 01:00:05,260
if he comes to know you 
went there,

710
01:00:05,417 --> 01:00:08,296
that is enough for him 
to throw you cut.

711
01:00:08,542 --> 01:00:10,886
Leave it on me, grandpa, 
I'll take care it.

712
01:00:11,042 --> 01:00:15,252
Instead of shuffling between 
two sons, why not unite them?

713
01:00:15,417 --> 01:00:17,761
It'll not happen in my life.

714
01:00:17,917 --> 01:00:20,636
It'll happen, will you do as I say?

715
01:00:20,792 --> 01:00:23,420
Yes to anything you say, grandson.

716
01:00:37,042 --> 01:00:38,009
Come father.

717
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:55,006
We got him boys! 
Tie him up!

718
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,502
He's your brother's future son-in-law.

719
01:01:00,667 --> 01:01:05,548
Is he his sun-in-law? 
Give him extra thrashing.

720
01:01:06,292 --> 01:01:08,636
But your brother hates him.

721
01:01:09,042 --> 01:01:10,294
Stop!

722
01:01:12,667 --> 01:01:14,044
What did you say?

723
01:01:14,625 --> 01:01:18,630
He's your brother's future son-in-law 
but he doesn't like him.

724
01:01:21,625 --> 01:01:25,425
If he hates him then I like him.

725
01:01:25,542 --> 01:01:28,796
Hey, came in.

726
01:01:28,917 --> 01:01:32,000
Smart boy!

727
01:01:33,875 --> 01:01:36,503
Man with sharp brain...

728
01:01:50,667 --> 01:01:52,385
Grandson, younger daughter-in-law.

729
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:57,924
She's also our party, she too is eagerly 
waiting for the two families to unite.

730
01:01:58,042 --> 01:01:59,043
I'll get the lunch ready, father-in-law.

731
01:02:00,625 --> 01:02:03,799
Does he know you're here?

732
01:02:03,917 --> 01:02:05,885
By now the news would've 
reached him.

733
01:02:06,042 --> 01:02:07,919
If he doesn't know it, 
tell him yourself.

734
01:02:08,042 --> 01:02:09,669
That you came hers.

735
01:02:18,417 --> 01:02:21,751
The man who doesn't know our 
traditions can't be my son-in-law.

736
01:02:22,542 --> 01:02:25,921
How dare he goes to that house! 
Doesn't he know that?

737
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:29,296
Any man going to that house 
can'! step into this house again.

738
01:02:30,292 --> 01:02:33,796
Is it anger for going there or 
a plan to throw him cut?

739
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:45,294
He gave him a chance.

740
01:02:45,792 --> 01:02:48,170
What's this Krish? 
Dad is very angry.

741
01:02:48,292 --> 01:02:49,794
Did I make him angry?

742
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,799
What will he do'? 
Would he scold me now?

743
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:54,922
Cams let's go.

744
01:02:56,250 --> 01:03:01,882
No Bhumi, anyone from this house or 
anyone your father likes goes there,

745
01:03:02,042 --> 01:03:04,670
he can get angry, if he's angry an 
me for going there means,

746
01:03:04,792 --> 01:03:08,296
your father has a soft corner for me.

747
01:03:14,417 --> 01:03:18,297
He has been cornered. 
- You feel like that.- What else?

748
01:03:32,417 --> 01:03:35,011
Why did you go there? 
- For your grandpa.

749
01:03:39,625 --> 01:03:43,675
Uncle, Krish is finished with this 
incident, I've packed his bag,

750
01:03:43,875 --> 01:03:45,798
throw him out...

751
01:03:46,542 --> 01:03:49,295
Looks like you've a strong wish!

752
01:03:50,417 --> 01:03:51,043
Have you packed everything?

753
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:55,300
I though! you'll he thrown out 
seeing uncle's anger.

754
01:03:55,417 --> 01:03:57,169
Ask Bhumi if you've any doubt.

755
01:03:58,125 --> 01:04:01,049
Hereafter I'll not follow uncle, 
I'll follow only you, brother.

756
01:04:01,167 --> 01:04:05,047
Give me a minute, 
I'll unload it in 30 seconds.- Go.

757
01:04:05,792 --> 01:04:08,045
I'm sure, it must be Krish First.

758
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:10,298
I don'! agree, I'm sure its Bhumi firs!.

759
01:04:10,417 --> 01:04:11,634
What's the problem, aunts?

760
01:04:11,792 --> 01:04:14,420
How did your love story start?

761
01:04:15,417 --> 01:04:16,384
There must be a love story, right?

762
01:04:16,542 --> 01:04:18,886
Tell me...tell me Bhumi.

763
01:04:19,042 --> 01:04:21,044
That! day...

764
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:23,673
I was standing a bus stop.

765
01:04:23,792 --> 01:04:26,511
After that".? 
- It rained then, right?

766
01:04:27,875 --> 01:04:30,674
How can it not rain in 
such scenes, aunty?

767
01:04:30,792 --> 01:04:32,544
Ware you alone then?

768
01:04:33,292 --> 01:04:35,044
I had few friends with me 
just like you.

769
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:38,048
Look, how great this dress is.

770
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:42,261
A big car came then and stopped.

771
01:04:42,417 --> 01:04:43,919
Krish was in it.

772
01:04:45,917 --> 01:04:47,635
You said he was a clerk's son, right?

773
01:04:48,292 --> 01:04:51,045
I mean his scooter was next to the car.

774
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:54,379
Krish was riding it. 
It seems he saw me then.

775
01:04:56,792 --> 01:04:59,386
Since then he chased me like hell.

776
01:05:01,042 --> 01:05:05,673
Not that who fell in love first. 
- He fell first.

777
01:05:06,042 --> 01:05:08,921
Fall down? 
- In love!

778
01:05:17,917 --> 01:05:20,636
Alter seeing you, 
I've forgotten to sleep.

779
01:05:20,792 --> 01:05:23,420
But I'm sleeping because 
you'll come in my dreams.

780
01:05:23,625 --> 01:05:29,428
I wanted to die...hut living with 
a wish to live with you.

781
01:05:29,917 --> 01:05:33,797
If you say no I'll give my life 
right now here.

782
01:05:34,167 --> 01:05:35,043
What did you after that?

783
01:05:35,167 --> 01:05:39,297
I didn't! want a man to die 
for my sake, so I said okay.

784
01:05:40,375 --> 01:05:41,501
What next?

785
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:47,050
Don't you know what's next 
after falling in love?

786
01:06:07,375 --> 01:06:14,668
Is it true? Am I day dreaming?

787
01:06:14,875 --> 01:06:21,793
Anyone I see...I think it's you...

788
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:29,418
I'm your dream". 
waiting for you like truth".

789
01:06:29,542 --> 01:06:37,302

for you now, my dear".

790
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:44,293
Life in me is you, dear".

791
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:52,131
Let's unite into one...

792
01:06:52,292 --> 01:07:01,918
Lat you and me become we...

793
01:07:03,292 --> 01:07:09,049
I don'! know its love or what 
but it's killing me...

794
01:07:11,042 --> 01:07:15,047
First love is hurting me 
deep inside...

795
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:38,009
The blowing wind hitting me 
is pushing me towards you...

796
01:07:45,667 --> 01:07:52,551
The happiness I never knew 
before is entering my life...

797
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:55,150
Gentle breeze reaches you...

798
01:08:03,667 --> 01:08:11,927
May I present you that 
happiness to you, my dear...

799
01:08:12,125 --> 01:08:17,757
I'm yours any day...

800
01:08:52,750 --> 01:09:00,009
The rotating earth wants 
to rotate round you...

801
01:09:07,875 --> 01:09:15,339
My wishes are out saying 
I'll never forget you...

802
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,900
Nut restricting myself to wishes, 
I'll be your partner for life...

803
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:34,010

01:09:34,208 --> 01:09:39,214
I'm with you always...

805
01:10:16,875 --> 01:10:21,130
Hi grandpa. 
- Come grandson.

806
01:10:21,833 --> 01:10:25,337
Of late money is losing the value.

807
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,628
What happened, grandpa? 
- Asking me what happened?

808
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:32,381
It seems one Surendra has bought 
a company for 4000 cores.

809
01:10:32,584 --> 01:10:34,882
Don'! call him informally, 
it's hurting me.- Why?

810
01:10:35,084 --> 01:10:36,711
1 If anyone calls your father 
informally, will you keep quiet?

811
01:10:36,875 --> 01:10:38,092
Why would I...

812
01:10:40,958 --> 01:10:44,758
You mean he is your... 
- Fatherl

813
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,755
Return the Rs.500 I gave you earlier.

814
01:10:50,958 --> 01:10:53,256
Why are you asking Rs.500, father?

815
01:10:53,459 --> 01:10:57,464
Nothing, he challenged to win 
over me in the game,

816
01:10:57,625 --> 01:10:59,753
I said bet is Rs.500.

817
01:10:59,875 --> 01:11:01,468
Are you such a great champion?

818
01:11:01,959 --> 01:11:02,755
Play.

819
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:04,251
Greetings sir.

820
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:08,709
How is your sun studying, Mallanna? 
- it's all your mercy sir.

821
01:11:08,875 --> 01:11:12,129
What are you studying now? 
- Preparing for civil s, brother.

822
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:16,209
I don'! know what you do, 
you must study well.

823
01:11:16,375 --> 01:11:19,128
The smile an Mallanna's face 
mustn't fade away.

824
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:22,220
Go.- Okay brother. 
- We'll take leave sir.

825
01:11:22,584 --> 01:11:25,884
You're locking after a worker's son 
like your own brother.

826
01:11:26,083 --> 01:11:28,757
Why are you than hard 
on your own brother...

827
01:11:30,834 --> 01:11:32,507
Which brother?

828
01:11:32,958 --> 01:11:35,837
The man who understands he's 
your father too along with him,

829
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,844
and one who sent him to you, 
your elder brother.

830
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:42,878
He's not my brother!

831
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,344
He's just his son.

832
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:51,094
Though we are sons of the same father, 
he listened to had advice,

833
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:55,380
and calling me a bastard 
he threw me out, that man!

834
01:11:55,584 --> 01:11:57,382
Is it my brother'?

835
01:11:59,625 --> 01:12:04,381
He made me grow like a orphan 
though I was among relatives,

836
01:12:04,584 --> 01:12:06,632
are you talking to about him?

837
01:12:08,375 --> 01:12:11,504
She came here with dream of 
being daughter-in-law to a big family.

838
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:19,714
He denied her a warm welcome 
too by sisters-in-law.

839
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:26,880
She has me as companion 
and I've her to live.

840
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,254
My father is here who comes 
here every 6 months,

841
01:12:30,459 --> 01:12:33,713
and this village which 
stands by me, that's all!

842
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,378
Brother, he boarded the bus just now.

843
01:12:48,584 --> 01:12:54,216
Uncle told me to just scare him, 
you kill that bastard.

844
01:12:54,958 --> 01:12:57,256
It must lack like a clash 
between two villages.

845
01:14:04,875 --> 01:14:07,003
Cams on, go fast!

846
01:15:30,333 --> 01:15:34,213
Go back! He'll kill us!

847
01:15:34,375 --> 01:15:36,218
We'll die if we go back also.

848
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:47,594
Jump out! bays!

849
01:17:28,375 --> 01:17:31,003
Do you know who ordered to beat you? 
- Isn't it you?

850
01:17:31,875 --> 01:17:34,879
He'll not dare touch me 
unless you say yes.

851
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:38,220
II he makes a try, 
I know you're behind him.

852
01:17:38,375 --> 01:17:40,503
How could you still be here 
after knowing this?

853
01:17:41,625 --> 01:17:43,627
Tall me what should I do 
to get rid of you?

854
01:17:44,083 --> 01:17:45,335
How much you want?

855
01:17:45,584 --> 01:17:48,133
Tell me your rate to leave my daughter.

856
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:50,503
What's the rate of your love 
for your daughter?

857
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:53,717
The same rate.

858
01:17:55,375 --> 01:17:56,877
Good orator.

859
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:02,130
I don'! like my daughter to marry you. 
I don't like you.

860
01:18:02,333 --> 01:18:04,006
What! made you like him, sir?

861
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:07,753
Won'! you listen it I say? 
- I'll not care even actions too.

862
01:18:07,959 --> 01:18:08,755
You tried it already.

863
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:17,209
Don'! try to get closer to Bhumi 
by telling about this incident.

864
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:21,878
Why are you going on saying 
you ordered to beat me?

865
01:18:22,083 --> 01:18:23,505
In fact I had beaten your men.

866
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:40,459
My father is behind this.

867
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:44,004
Are you mad? 
- Enough of it, leave it.

868
01:18:44,125 --> 01:18:45,843
Please go away.

869
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,594
You came here confidently 
because I'm with you.

870
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:52,505
If I go I'll make your confidence 
come true and then go.

871
01:18:52,625 --> 01:18:56,755
Though you may change people here, 
they'll not dare face my father.

872
01:18:56,875 --> 01:18:59,594
Even if my father changes, 
he'll never like you Krish.

873
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:00,876
That's what I wan!.

874
01:19:01,084 --> 01:19:03,587
Your father must change 
and he mustn't like me.

875
01:19:04,584 --> 01:19:06,882
You said he'll not leave anyone 
if he likes.

876
01:19:07,084 --> 01:19:10,088
By any chance he likes me, 
your friend will kill me.

877
01:19:12,958 --> 01:19:17,134
You said you were always happy and 
lived in happy surroundings only.

878
01:19:17,334 --> 01:19:18,961
That's nu! true, Krish.

879
01:19:19,875 --> 01:19:22,628
Happiness is there where you are!

880
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:25,629
Everyone is happy 
where ever you are!

881
01:19:59,709 --> 01:20:04,340
He's from that village, tried to 
elope with a girl from our village.

882
01:20:15,375 --> 01:20:16,752
Do you love him?

883
01:20:18,375 --> 01:20:20,218
Do you love him?

884
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:23,719
You must inform your parents 
and marry if you love.

885
01:20:23,875 --> 01:20:25,001
Why did you elope?

886
01:20:25,208 --> 01:20:27,336
If she had told, this situation 
wouldn'! have risen.

887
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:29,218
We would've killed her by now.

888
01:20:29,375 --> 01:20:31,503
That's why they tried to slope!

889
01:20:34,958 --> 01:20:40,510
You don'! know about the enmity 
between the villages.

890
01:20:42,459 --> 01:20:45,258
Tell me, why do you hale that village?

891
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:49,629
Why you hate a man from that village?

892
01:20:50,875 --> 01:20:55,005
You've made two people's personal 
rivalry into village enmity,

893
01:20:55,959 --> 01:21:00,135
which these people horn and 
brought up here aren't aware of.

894
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:05,002
How would I know?

895
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:08,094
What's this? You were born here, 
you grew up here only,

896
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:11,504
here one who lives with revenge 
is man not one with love.

897
01:21:11,709 --> 01:21:13,507
Man with hatred is great!

898
01:21:15,084 --> 01:21:17,963
They're not bothered about anyone 
in their one-upmanship tussle.

899
01:21:18,125 --> 01:21:22,710
Even if ifs their mother". 
or father!

900
01:21:24,125 --> 01:21:27,504
The only mistake yours is 
you were born in that village.

901
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:29,842
Come.

902
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:32,877
Sir, he's going away.

903
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,879
We'll not get him again, 
say yes, we'll kill him.

904
01:21:38,375 --> 01:21:40,878
Who is it? Who said that?

905
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:42,752
Who is the man who will dare kill him?

906
01:21:42,958 --> 01:21:45,757
The entire village is one side 
and I'm on his side,

907
01:21:45,875 --> 01:21:49,254
let anyone who has courage to 
touch him & go back alive can try.

908
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:50,876
Come on!

909
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:58,880
I'm taking him, am I not? 
I'll take him.

910
01:22:34,125 --> 01:22:37,959
A man from my village is 
getting beaten up there,

911
01:22:38,125 --> 01:22:39,502
move aside.

912
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,092
What's this son?

913
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:54,007
For each punch you get a man from 
that village will lose his hand, Ravi.

914
01:22:54,125 --> 01:22:57,504
That's all? I thought 
you'll say kill them.

915
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:01,878
They're not responsible for what 
had happened to him today,

916
01:23:02,083 --> 01:23:03,084
you too are responsible,

917
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:05,002
What should I do with you then?

918
01:23:06,584 --> 01:23:10,384
You gave a life to him as 
his elder brother.

919
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,503
But he's going away without 
informing you too,

920
01:23:13,833 --> 01:23:15,506
do you know the reason for it?

921
01:23:15,875 --> 01:23:21,211
You stood by him in everything but 
he fears you'll not support his love.

922
01:23:26,125 --> 01:23:30,005
You had hope that he'll achieve 
what he wants in life.

923
01:23:30,375 --> 01:23:33,345
But he's standing before you 
defeated unable to win his love.

924
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,377
What else can he achieve in life?

925
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:42,630
You made him what he is today, 
you've all the rights on him.

926
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:47,380
Becoming his support or hurdle 
is in your hands now.

927
01:23:54,875 --> 01:23:57,503
He's not fit to be my son-in-law.

928
01:24:05,208 --> 01:24:07,085
Did you fall in love with such a man?

929
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:09,093
Forget him.

930
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:22,720
Come...are you a macho man'?

931
01:24:23,084 --> 01:24:24,006
Macho man?

932
01:24:24,709 --> 01:24:27,212
Did you get my village to 
show your manliness?

933
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:31,380
Ara you so great to change 
25 year old enmity in a jiffy?

934
01:24:33,208 --> 01:24:37,088
You'd be dead by now 
if you weren't! my guest.

935
01:24:37,334 --> 01:24:44,468
Though I hate you so much, aren't! you 
ashamed to hang out here still?

936
01:24:49,208 --> 01:24:53,463
She may've liked you for your 
monkey tricks and sweet talk.

937
01:24:53,959 --> 01:24:58,465
But you can'! become my son-in-law 
if she only likes you.

938
01:24:59,334 --> 01:25:01,211
He must like you, he must like you,

939
01:25:01,375 --> 01:25:02,126
she must like you.

940
01:25:02,250 --> 01:25:05,129
I must like you. 
Entire village must like you.

941
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:08,628
But nobody likes you here.

942
01:25:10,209 --> 01:25:11,711
Nobody likes you here.

943
01:25:14,375 --> 01:25:18,130
Do you think she can't live without you?

944
01:25:19,125 --> 01:25:20,843
Once you leave this home,

945
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,254
she'll forget you in few days with the 
love and affection of this family.

946
01:25:26,209 --> 01:25:31,636
Listen, I'm the head of village 
and this family too,

947
01:25:31,833 --> 01:25:36,259
my son-in-law must be a heir 
who can protect my honour,

948
01:25:36,459 --> 01:25:38,837
not a cheap person like you... 
- Stop it!

949
01:25:42,584 --> 01:25:43,631
Stop it!

950
01:25:44,584 --> 01:25:46,757
You talked about what this 
village thinks of him,

951
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:48,627
do you know what your 
family thinks of him?

952
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:54,711
You say hatred and 
we say surrender, brother-in-law.

953
01:25:59,125 --> 01:26:02,208
We mustn't talk about manliness 
and greatness, brother-in-law.

954
01:26:02,375 --> 01:26:05,003
You invited him here and then 
ordered goons to beat him,

955
01:26:05,125 --> 01:26:08,459
yet he's amongst us with 
an unfading smile,

956
01:26:08,625 --> 01:26:11,003
that is greatness, brother-in-law.

957
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:17,836
He bashed up your hired goons, 
that is manliness, brother-in-law.

958
01:26:20,125 --> 01:26:22,378
Uncle, you calm down. 
- Don'! stop me.

959
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:26,709
You may be thinking of throwing 
out me for talking against you,

960
01:26:26,875 --> 01:26:28,752
we lived here till now 
with that tear only,

961
01:26:28,875 --> 01:26:34,211
he gave us confidence 
to live with dignity, brother-in-law.

962
01:26:34,958 --> 01:26:37,882
How is that'? 
I can become son-in-law,

963
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,502
he can also become 
your sun-in-law,

964
01:26:39,709 --> 01:26:43,009
even that rogue can became 
your sun-in-law,

965
01:26:43,125 --> 01:26:47,005
but this man who wishes this home to 
be happy always can't become son-in-law.

966
01:26:47,208 --> 01:26:48,505
Isn't it brother-in-law?

967
01:26:50,875 --> 01:26:57,383
Brother, I don't know if Bhumi forgets him 
in love and affection of this home or not,

968
01:26:58,125 --> 01:27:03,131
but we can't forget him who made 
us realise what is affection.

969
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:08,209
Brother, this village always 
followed you blindly.

970
01:27:09,084 --> 01:27:11,507
But we want what you actually think.

971
01:27:12,709 --> 01:27:14,211
Brother, one thing is true,

972
01:27:14,875 --> 01:27:19,711
we can't find a better man 
than him for our Bhumi.

973
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,844
Sir, you don't bother about them.

974
01:27:29,084 --> 01:27:31,758
As you said they fell 
for my antics...

975
01:27:35,459 --> 01:27:39,760
I thought they respected me till 
now with love and affection.

976
01:27:41,625 --> 01:27:45,129
But you made me realise ifs fear.

977
01:27:57,750 --> 01:28:00,594
Do you know why I'm going 
on saying I hate you?

978
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,503
In the fear that I may like you.

979
01:28:12,334 --> 01:28:14,837
I lost! my father as a kid,

980
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:20,004
I thought my wife is my life but 
lost her too in two years,

981
01:28:21,375 --> 01:28:23,503
after that she's my life.

982
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,502
She's my world.

983
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:30,343
I didn't! even tell her that!.

984
01:28:32,375 --> 01:28:34,628
I don't know why I've become like this.

985
01:28:36,125 --> 01:28:38,378
I forgot to talk affectionately.

986
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:42,629
Unable to slay away from my sisters, 
I've made them stay here,

987
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:52,337
fearing my daughter will go away 
after knowing she loves someone.

988
01:28:54,209 --> 01:28:58,214
I was selfish to many her to my 
nephew so that she lives here only.

989
01:29:01,125 --> 01:29:02,877
That's why I called you here.

990
01:29:04,083 --> 01:29:08,008
I wanted to get rid of you 
from her life at any cost.

991
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:11,503
I wanted to win aver you 
with their support.

992
01:29:13,375 --> 01:29:14,752
Bu! you won!

993
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:17,752
I've lost!

994
01:29:19,375 --> 01:29:20,718
Lost!

995
01:29:24,834 --> 01:29:25,505
Come.

996
01:29:33,208 --> 01:29:35,381
I told you to bring the man you Iovs,

997
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:38,752
but you brought home love!

998
01:29:46,083 --> 01:29:47,130
I like him.

999
01:30:15,875 --> 01:30:19,254
I told about us in my home, 
they've agreed.

1000
01:30:20,209 --> 01:30:22,132
Do you know how tensed I was!

1001
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:27,253
Have your parents too agreed?

1002
01:30:33,625 --> 01:30:35,468
Whose Lord Krishna he is...

1003
01:30:53,709 --> 01:30:55,006
Krish, you go away.

1004
01:30:56,875 --> 01:31:00,004
Our worst fears have come true.

1005
01:31:00,459 --> 01:31:02,006
My father likes you.

1006
01:31:02,834 --> 01:31:07,089
I was eager to hear a word of 
affection from my dad.

1007
01:31:07,375 --> 01:31:10,003
You made me realise 
that I'm his world.

1008
01:31:10,333 --> 01:31:12,006
That's enough, Krish.

1009
01:31:12,625 --> 01:31:15,834
I dun'! want you to he here 
and get embarrassed,

1010
01:31:16,125 --> 01:31:16,876
Go away.

1011
01:31:17,084 --> 01:31:21,009
If I go away now, 
I'll be a cheat to your father,

1012
01:31:21,584 --> 01:31:23,461
ifs hound to happen 
today or in future,

1013
01:31:23,625 --> 01:31:25,377
that's not a big deal,

1014
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:29,709
but your people who supported me 
with love against your father,

1015
01:31:30,125 --> 01:31:31,877
if they came to know 
that trust is false?

1016
01:31:32,209 --> 01:31:35,088
You may've to bow your heads 
all the life with your father.

1017
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,253
This problem is because 
your father likes me.

1018
01:31:40,709 --> 01:31:42,131
Let's tell him the truth.

1019
01:31:42,333 --> 01:31:43,505
To my father?

1020
01:31:43,750 --> 01:31:48,085
I've a little hope that he'll 
understand us now.

1021
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:48,876
Come.

1022
01:31:54,125 --> 01:31:56,594
First time I've failed to 
keep my word, brother-in-law.

1023
01:31:56,958 --> 01:31:58,210
Can't avoid it.

1024
01:31:58,750 --> 01:32:03,130
My daughter will not marry 
your son, brother-in-law.

1025
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:12,380
Your sister is dead, so you're 
burying the promise given to her.

1026
01:32:12,584 --> 01:32:15,884
Had my sister been alive, 
I'm confident of convincing her.

1027
01:32:16,209 --> 01:32:18,507
I'm worried that you must 
understand it.

1028
01:32:23,250 --> 01:32:25,218
I know Bhumi is happiness 
is with Krish,

1029
01:32:25,375 --> 01:32:27,594
she won'! he happy if I forcibly 
marry her with your son.

1030
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:29,593
You too can't live happily.

1031
01:32:31,125 --> 01:32:36,632
What should I do to make 
your daughter happy, uncle?

1032
01:32:40,875 --> 01:32:42,718
I'll feed her with three square meals,

1033
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,879
I'll make her pregnant in a month,

1034
01:32:46,375 --> 01:32:49,254
I'll present you with a grandson 
in 9 months,

1035
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:54,085
is that enough for your 
daughter to be happy?

1036
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:06,959
Till now I didn't! respect you 
with any regard,

1037
01:33:07,125 --> 01:33:08,627
for the desire on her,

1038
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:11,629
ever since my teens
I always thought she's mine,

1039
01:33:11,833 --> 01:33:16,839
if you say no now, 
am I a eunuch to keep quiet?

1040
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,504
What's in your mind is 
now in my mind too,

1041
01:33:49,625 --> 01:33:50,842
to kill you,

1042
01:33:51,459 --> 01:33:55,009
if you dare touch anyone 
in this family again,

1043
01:33:55,125 --> 01:33:58,004
you'll have only one hand 
to eat and wash.

1044
01:34:01,084 --> 01:34:05,840
Will you keep quiet if your 
son dares to hold my collar?

1045
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:11,711
Sc all these years people I 
considered as mine are strangers,

1046
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:15,253
and one whom I thought 
is stranger is now mine.

1047
01:34:19,625 --> 01:34:23,505
Till now you thought your son will 
become heir to this family,

1048
01:34:23,875 --> 01:34:28,506
I'm telling you now, 
the real heir has come,

1049
01:34:28,875 --> 01:34:30,718
my future son-in-law!

1050
01:34:39,833 --> 01:34:43,588
Trusting a stranger, are you 
breaking relationship with us?

1051
01:34:43,709 --> 01:34:49,261
Trusting you, I gave up my own brother.

1052
01:34:50,584 --> 01:34:55,511
But this trust has shown me 
what I've lost in my life.

1053
01:34:56,709 --> 01:35:01,215
I'm going to his home, 
I'm going to my brother.

1054
01:35:03,208 --> 01:35:05,210
I'll bring him to this home.

1055
01:35:08,875 --> 01:35:11,219
Gel ready the vehicles.

1056
01:35:11,875 --> 01:35:12,876
Come.

1057
01:35:29,459 --> 01:35:30,881
Brother!

1058
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:16,133
I'm not here as village head, 
I'm here as your elder brother.

1059
01:36:30,125 --> 01:36:32,503
Father!

1060
01:36:34,750 --> 01:36:37,629

Is it she?

Why would she be here?

1098
01:41:38,125 --> 01:41:39,468
Stop it!

1099
01:41:43,458 --> 01:41:48,464
Brother, my daughter is here.

1100
01:42:07,834 --> 01:42:11,134
We don't have children, brother. 
Daughter of Lakshmi's sister.

1101
01:42:14,375 --> 01:42:16,127
More than my own daughter.

1102
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:19,127
She's my life, brother.

1103
01:42:26,625 --> 01:42:27,592
Come!

1104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,343
~

1105
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:21,969
Dear, my brother's future son-in-law.

1106
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:28,755
My brother's daughter Bhumi.

1107
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:34,129
Don'! know from where she 
found him, he's all gold.

1108
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:37,462
All the happiness you see 
here is his magic.

1109
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:42,008
Krishna, you're getting 
engaged to Bhumi in a week.

1110
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:53,255
Dun'! feel had for taking 
decision without consulting you.

1111
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:58,634
Any first function here 
must be yours.

1112
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:01,505
Call your parents.

1113
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:12,127
Enough Krish.

1114
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,593
I thought if you come here 
as my boy friend,

1115
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:20,838
my problem will get solved 
and we'll leave this place,

1116
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,959
but do you've to many Indu 
and come here?

1117
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,844
No Krish, I'll tell the truth to father.

1118
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,126
We can't tell, Bhumi.

1119
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,506
But they are talking about engagement.

1120
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:36,593
They're not talking about marriage, right?

1121
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:39,843
If you tell them the truth now,

1122
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,959
if they agree for our marriage, 
let's tell them right now, come.

1123
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:54,880
Your father has changed 
and two families are happy.

1124
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,877
Two villages are happy.

1125
00:01:57,375 --> 00:02:01,380
If you tell him the truth, 
all this happiness will vanish.

1126
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:07,211
The drama we started for you 
must continue for our families.

1127
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,468
What! do you say?

1128
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:12,717
What?

1129
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:17,379
I said just now in a flow 
that we can't tell.

1130
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,585
But after hearing you, 
I fear I may not tell in my life.

1131
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:28,260
You played with my life, 
don't you know you were sisters?

1132
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:31,254
I asked her 
which is your native place?

1133
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:35,463
She said Rayalaseema. 
I said Telengana when she asked me.

1134
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:41,087
I thought it is politician's problem 
if a state has so many regions,

1135
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,002
how could it become a problem to me?

1136
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,252
Oh no! My dad!

1137
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,126
Father!

1138
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:50,964
Ara you enjoying my son? 
- Enjoying like hell, dad.

1139
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,969
I could understand what joy is 
after coming here.

1140
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,378
Where are you now?

1141
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,085
At Niagara water falls, dad.

1142
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,753
Came home quickly sun. 
- Yes dad.

1143
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,130
Ha has asked to call your parents, 
what will you do now?

1144
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,127
That's what I'm confused.

1145
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:15,383
Let's do one thing, 
shall we hire your parents like you?

1146
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,630
How do you get such ideas? 
Never stagger for moment.

1147
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,459
Let's try that! too.

1148
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,130
Ha's my father.

1149
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,127
She's mother!

1150
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,753
Son? What about my father then?

1151
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,631
How much I missed you my son?

1152
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,131
Why is he hugging him?

1153
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,127
Locks like daddy is still angry on me.

1154
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,754
Daddy is still angry an me for 
coming here without informing him.

1155
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,131
Are you my son? 
I thought that shun man is my son.

1156
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:18,132
Don't talk much and manage it carefully.

1157
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,507
I've get a rare chance of live character, 
I'll give a riveting performance.

1158
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,501
Gs! the luggage.

1159
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,005
Welcome brother-in-law. 
- Greetings.

1160
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,505
Was your joumey sale and happy?

1161
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,507
Was journey nice'? Did you've food? 
Are you fine?

1162
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,881
I'm allergic to such routine questions.

1163
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,505
When will you leave?

1164
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,003
That's Bhumi. 
- Future daughter-in-law, right?

1165
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,502
He is... 
- My future kinsman.

1166
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:45,876
He is... 
- Bride's brother.

1167
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,504

00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:58,631
No...no...I won'! do anything

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,334
Why aren't! you saying anything, sister? 
- Talk to her.

1173
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,502
What! ever he says, I second him.

1174
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,219
She has only one dialogue. 
- Shut it.

1175
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,755
She's your second daughter. 
- Wrong, my daughter.

1176
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,252
Why is he countering ms?

1177
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:19,254
Watch now, I'll give him 
a run for his money.

1178
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,002
Your daughter is also of 
marriageable age,

1179
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,253
End a groom for her also, if not of 
the range of my son, find someone,

How was my shot? 
What's that?

1182
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,333
What a brain! 
Like son like father!

1183
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,127
What do you say Indu?

1184
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,084
Uncle!

1185
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,220
You said you lava a boy in city, 
call him here.

1186
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:43,084

I'm telling you, call him hers.

1188
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,379
He left to some place getting 
angry on me, uncle.

1189
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:56,755
If anyone leaves it must be we, 
how can he leave you?

1190
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,878
I'll not leave him even if he leaves.

1191
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,754
It's their family problem, 
why are you getting tensed?

1192
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:05,880
Come. 
- Come.

1193
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:14,257
Go to lndu's college in city, 
it seems someone cheated Indu,

1194
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,837
present him before me 
in two days. Go!

1195
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,217
Okay brother.

1196
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,127
Hey short man!

1197
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,253
Why did you coma here? 
What have you dune?

1198
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:33,132
Why are you bothered about 
his daughters marriage?

1199
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,628
Do I look like a comedian to you?

1200
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,343
Why are you talking me down?

1201
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,503
They said ifs 'Bommarillu' film's 
father character.

1202
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,343
I must be talking you dawn.

1203
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,376
ODE more scapegoat.

1204
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:51,258
I dun'! know what's going on here, 
but I know something is going on,

1205
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:55,133
if I reveal the secrets, 
you know what will happen then,

1206
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,630
till then...

1207
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,961
Please don't take it to your heart. 
- Go away.

1208
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,627
Uncle?

1209
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,627
Maintain this fear.

1210
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,084
I feel like seeing myself 
on seeing you sir.

1211
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:17,754
Isn't it brother?

1212
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,711
Initially we feel everything 
is in our control,

1213
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:24,382
but slowly it goes into brother's 
control without our knowledge.

1214
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,005
Who is this fool?

1215
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,506
How much did you pay him 
to praise you?

1216
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,209
I can understand your future, 
I can see your future,

1217
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,878
he'll get it, 
his head will get blown up.

1218
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:45,459
Festival brother-in-law, 
engagement is just a week away,

1219
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:46,751
take all of them to city 
and buy anything they ask.

1220
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,256
You gave the responsibility, 
leave it on me.

1221
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,753
Hyderabad 40 kms

1222
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,877
What's that nasty driving, stupid?

1223
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,835
She kissed brother.

1224
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,256
They're getting engaged, 
nothing wrong if they kiss each other.

1225
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,218
The kiss came from left side 
not the right side.

1226
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,127
Where did you see it? 
- In the mirror.

1227
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:17,758
In mirror the images is 
always opposite, stupid.

1228
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,126
Go!

1229
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,129
How worried I was! 
Thank God it was from left.

1230
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,631
Had it been right, it would've 
created a big problem, right?

1231
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,380
Younger uncle is very tough man.

1232
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:37,336
Forget about left and right, 
whose did you see in the mirror?

1233
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,255
It's strange I saw lndu's face. 
- It was Indu who kissed me.

1234
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,255
Invited trouble from elder uncle,

1235
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,460
it it necessary to pick up trouble 
from younger uncle too?

1236
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,219
I'm confidant that you're there 
to take care of anything.

1237
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,629
How confident you're on me, brother! 
- That's it, come.

1238
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,719
Shaw me the ones on left side, 
how many for the bride?

1239
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,468
Two!

1240
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:02,880
Yes...yes hubby! 
- You take 20!

1241
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:08,133
What are you looking at'? 
Tell me how many for the groom?

1242
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,217
Krish, for you... 
- For me...

1243
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,254
Why are you asking him? 
I'm the one to decide.

1244
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,257
Take three. 
- Then 30 for you, brother?

1245
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,754
Though you appear like a Incl, 
your maths is very strong.

1246
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:23,509
My condition is like this for one night, 
what about him, brother?

1247
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:28,005
Isn't that sari nice? 
- Aunty...aunty...

1248
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,506
Why are you shouting loud?

1249
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,504
Aunty...is this sari good on ma?

1250
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:40,212
Sari is good, 
but I doubt if it suits you.

1251
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:45,960
You're talking to her as 
if you know for lung time.

1252
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,756
Brother ls always like that only, 
brother is too frank,

1253
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,127
he never hesitates,

1254
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,006
what ever it is, 
he says it openly on face,

1255
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,378
do you need to know 
a person to tell an opinion?

1256
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,502
Isn't it brother? I'm telling you...

1257
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:08,758
This sari is very had on you, Indu. 
You know that?

1258
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,877
I didn't expect this.

1259
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,210
I can understand your tension.

1260
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,210
Keep it aside.

1261
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,128
He's a pain. Coming daddy.

1262
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,210
Try it. 
- Do you select for your son too?

1263
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:32,005
I'm Bommarillu father, 
I select and he wears.

1264
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:35,132
If I select shorts, he must wear, go. 
- Okay daddy.

1265
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:51,260
Why did you come in'? 
- You...isn't sari nice to me?

1266
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,587
Why are you sweating AC also?

1267
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,753
Ara you here? 
I'll try those clothes.

1268
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,336
Do you know why I'm sweating now?

1269
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,879
What's going an here? 
- Don't try to know it. You'll die.

1270
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,593
You'll get it.... 
you'll get the stick of life.

1271
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,593
Do I? What! is it?

1272
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,092
Where is brother'?

1273
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:27,963
You both are here, so he'll come hack. 
He'll be back.

1274
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,131
Why haven't the vehicles started yet?

1275
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:37,130
Let anyone see us, we mustn't 
be seen by him, brother.

1276
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,629
We missed him once, 
that doesn't we'll miss him every time.

1277
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,378
We've a good plan this tima.

1278
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:45,129
Brother!

1279
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,376
Have they left?

1280
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,127
Sister-in-law is in the firs! vehicle.

1281
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,254
I'll call you once the 
vehicles start, brother.

1282
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:58,963
Why did he run away suddenly?

1283
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,630
Brother, we bought whites for all of them.

1284
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,256
White briefs and vests too.

1285
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:25,084
Have you finished them without 
making a sound, brother?

1286
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:52,086
A small doubt brother.

1287
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:57,338
The counting is wrong, 
another one is missing.

1288
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,252
Did you find that rogue?

1289
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:26,880
No news about his 
whereabouts also, brother.

1290
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,343
What! should we do now, brother?

1291
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:36,260
Do one thing, bring his parents, 
he'll come here on his own.

1292
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:41,381
Brother, his father is a big shot. 
- Bigger than me'?

1293
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,757
Ha's one of the biggest in India. 
- Just do as I say.

1294
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:52,464
Leave him...leave him...

1295
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,129
Move...

1296
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,006
Brother, we brought {hem.

1297
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:07,510
Hay bald head! He's my kinsman, 
give him respect.

1298
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,336
Sorry brother-in-law. 
- Please lake your seat sir.

1299
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,003
Brother-in-law? 
What's all this?

1300
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,630
Indu dear!

1301
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,084
What's it uncle?

1302
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,336
Uncle...what are you doing here? 
- That's what I too don't know.

1303
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:30,336
Isn't it their son who cheated 
you and ran away?

1304
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,334
Ran away? 
My son is on a world tour.

1305
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,378
Did that rogue tell you like that?

1306
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:43,089
Let him be America or Amalapuram, 
you must be here till he comes.

1307
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,376
Here?

1308
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:52,337
No use in building body. 
Learn how to raise a sun.

1309
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,468
You've grown tall like a palm tree.

1310
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,379
Did you see him? Do you know 
how he has raised his sun?

1311
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,003
He has raised him like a tiger.

1312
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,460
Call your son, brother-in-law.

1313
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:09,379
Hey where are you boy?

1314
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:20,212
It seems your younger uncle's 
kinsman is here, bow to him.

1315
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,376
Okay daddy.

1316
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,085
Greetings uncle...

1317
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:33,508
What's that look? 
Forgotten howl raised you?

1318
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,504
They may not be rich like us 
but elders by age, right?

1319
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:37,630
Greet them.

1320
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,755
Greetings uncle.

1321
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,127
What's this lather? 
Will you go to any place?

1322
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,502
Can'! you tell me before coming?

1323
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:57,509
Son, you were on a world tour. 
You'd in South Africa or Niagara falls,

1324
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,128
and we didn't want to disturb you.

1325
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,629
Moreover you've set up 
a new mom and dad too.

1326
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:12,132
Sorry dad, I lied to you. 
Couldn't avoid it.

1327
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,504
Anyway you would've thought of doing 
like this in your youth but couldn't.

1328
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:17,379
That's why I've done it.

1329
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,504
I never thought of doing 
anything like this.

1330
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,881
Why did you come here?

1331
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,460
That's what had happened, mother.

1332
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:55,132
I didn't expect you'll be in 
trouble because of me.

1333
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:59,963
My son wouldn't come here it you 
were doing anything wrong.

1334
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,470
Because my son will never 
do anything wrong.

1335
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:09,838
That's my mother, tell him also. 
I'm unable to see that face.

1336
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,128
I'm unable to tolerate this heat too.

1337
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,718
What's that dirty dress, mother?

1338
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:26,709
They didn't give us time to 
pack our bags, son.

1339
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:31,755
I thought my sun will take me 
to very high place.

1340
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:35,004
See from where you've 
brought us down.

1341
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,002
Phone didn't! ring.

1342
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:45,382
Hello, your face looks familiar.

1343
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,219
You came for last year's 
wrestling competition, right?

1344
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,255
May be.

1345
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,459
Come.

1346
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,630
May be forgotten it.

1347
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,342
Brother!

1348
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,085
I didn't even think in my dream, 
that we'll be together.

1349
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,880
Had he came here earlier, 
we would've been united, brother.

1350
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,380
You know my husband loves jasmine.

1351
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:30,963
San-in-law, you're a big shot. 
- Brother, you're the big shot.

1352
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:35,084
If big shot says he's bigger shot, 
what's bothering you man?

1353
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,002
From today son-in-law 
too is big shut.

1354
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,968
Fixed. 
- Okay brother.

1355
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:49,257
They're talking so much about him, 
why not say something but your man?

1356
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,467
Come on tell.

1357
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,632
He's no match to my boyfriend, mother.

1358
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,094
My boy friend is a sharp dagger.

1359
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,709
You've a dagger here and one there. 
How many daggers!

1360
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:05,963
You know haw many lovers my hay 
friend had united in college?

1361
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,130
He's a real man.

1362
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,094
He'II take any risk for me, 
you know that?

1363
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:17,631
When will he came here? 
When will he marry me?

1364
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:22,129
When she's talking about 
a Iover who isn't! here,

1365
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,093
how much you should talk 
about Krish who is here?

1366
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,126
Say something.

1367
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,969
Come on tell. 
That he was ready to die for you.

1368
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,334
Did your boyfriend say 
he'll die for you?

1369
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,630
How can you dare compare 
your boy friend with mine?

1370
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,881
Your man united lovers, 
my man united two families.

1371
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,468
He united two villages.

1372
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:54,130
Do you know my man can do 
anything for my happiness?

1373
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,129
One can he happy for few 
minutes from a boy friend,

1374
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,127
can be happy of few days,

1375
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:05,133
but my life has changed 
because of Krish.

1376
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:15,377
I never in my dream imagined 
to see such a day in my life.

1377
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:27,257
She's talking so much 
about her man, uncle.

1378
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:30,007
Why not say something about your son?

1379
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,379
My son is super!

1380
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,129
If your son is super, 
then my son is bumper.

1381
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,632
If you can say like that for 
a son who isn't here,

1382
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,006
how much I must say about 
my son who is here?

1383
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,381
Why dun'! you say something? 
Tongue tied?

1384
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,381
You cool dawn daddy. 
- You shut up.

1385
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:54,257
It isn't! great to have children, 
any couple would do that.

1386
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:57,094
Matter is whether you've 
a dagger like son.

1387
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:00,379
I challenged to make 
him a star on birth.

1388
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,085
I've made him a star.

1389
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,757
Raising children doesn't! mean 
earning billions for them.

1390
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,842
Shut up.

1391
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,844
You must give him the capacity 
to earn billions, I've gven him that.

1392
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,752
Daddy, stop it now. 
- You keep quiet.

1393
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:20,253
You've a son who has escaped.

1394
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:24,634
Uncle, you don'! know about 
your future.

1395
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:28,258
I know very well about my future. 
It's in my son's hands.

1396
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:30,877
Shall we go to sleep daddy? 
I'm feeling sleepy.

1397
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,630
He's finished.

1398
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:36,003
How lucky you are brother-in-law!

1399
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:38,757
Your son still wants to 
sleep with you.

1400
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,627
Lat's go to sleep. 
· Come.

1401
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,628
Are you shocked?

1402
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,753
Did you see how I built your image?

1403
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:10,634
Why am I here instead of there?

1404
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:15,132
Why are you after him? 
You know your height?

1405
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,843
If you stand next to him, 
you'll barely reach his thighs.

1406
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,753
One punch from him and 
you'll die, bloody short man!

1407
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:23,588
You didn't get my performance, 
I had praised you, right?

1408
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,377
You didn't! praise me, 
you were abusing me.

1409
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:26,630
How is it?

1410
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:31,458
I was abusing his son, right'? 
- I'm his sun.

1411
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:36,755
Poor man!

1412
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,630
What did you just say now? 
- That is...

1413
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,751
Wait, I'll tell.

1414
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:42,837
Did you raise to make me a star'? 
- Yes.- Is it?

1415
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,631
You said another thing, 
I can'! recollect it.

1416
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:47,756
No need of those details.

1417
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:50,131
Will you beat me 
remembering those lines?

1418
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:54,839
He blabbered about millions or billions. 
- You keep quiet, don't prompt.

1419
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,718
He remembers everything.

1420
00:23:57,708 --> 00:24:00,211
I remember everything clearly.

1421
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:15,719
Had a good sleep last night?

1422
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:17,969
Are you asking after knowing 
everything, sir?

1423
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:21,883
Couldn't you've told me 
that he's your son?

1424
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,254
Did he trouble you? 
- Trouble?

1425
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:31,386
He started the music last night 
and continued till morning,

1426
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:33,506
never gave a minute res! too.

1427
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:37,880
Looks like you'd a slept very 
well last night with your sun.

1428
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:39,881
Very soundly!

1429
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:42,757
Last night you said something 
about your son.

1430
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:45,128
No need to repeat it again now.

1431
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,129
It was music to hears, 
say it once again.

1432
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:53,008
I mean strength. 
- You've it, brother-in-law.

1433
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,342
Me'!

1434
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,752
I've a doubt.

1435
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,094
What could he our situation 
if they know this is drama?

1436
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:06,129
My son is here to save me.

1437
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,584
How would I know who is 
here to save you?

1438
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,881
Give me that, dear. 
- Lock at this.

1439
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:16,095
Why are you indifferent? 
It's your engagement, select.

1440
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,129
Mother, red bangles will be 
good for you, try it.

1441
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:23,709
Your son knows very well 
what suits you best.

1442
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,467
Come...come...

1443
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:34,755
Came I say!

1444
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:42,127
It's better he gives my CD.

1445
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,459
What are you doing? 
- Just now took :-1 BP tablet.

1446
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:53,468
Please deal carefully, brother.

1447
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:56,253
Okay come. 
- He's taking me to hell.

1448
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,127
Tell me. 
- Tell me'!

1449
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:06,335
You must tell and I must fallow it. 
- Not you, look to your right.

1450
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:11,506
This is routine...routine...

1451
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:13,379
Make it habit.

1452
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:16,382
Locks like you and Bhumi are very close.

1453
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:19,754
Do you small anything 
burning here, Chilli?

1454
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:23,258
Every day a par! in my body is burning, 
I don't get any smell, brother.

1455
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:26,254
She told so much about you last nigh!.

1456
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:29,007
Each person understands us differently, 
she understood me like that.

1457
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:31,002
Good if he doesn't! come here.

1458
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,129
I beg you, I'll fall at your feet, 
I'll do anything you say.

1459
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:37,756
Younger uncle is coming, 
let's go away, brother.

1460
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:40,128
What are you doing there, son-in-law?

1461
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:45,510
We are discussing about breaking 
up of India-Pakistan peace talks?

1462
00:26:45,708 --> 00:26:46,960
Isn't it brother?

1463
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:52,586
I didn't ask you coward, 
did you see Indu, son-in-law?

1464
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,878
Indu? How could we see her, uncle?

1465
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,254
We didn't! see her, uncle. 
Tell us if you see her, uncle.

1466
00:26:58,458 --> 00:27:02,759
I'll beat you with slippers, 
are you mad?

1467
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:05,005
Who asked you?

1468
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,006
Indu is behind you, uncle.

1469
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,002
What are you doing hers, dear?

1470
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:13,219
They are buying bangles down 
there, you too join them.

1471
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,086
Don't roam with that coward, 
he'll make you also go crazy.

1472
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:22,883
Uncle, you don'! know 
who is fooling whom.

1473
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:29,260
What great news, Mallanna! 
I said your son will succeed in life.

1474
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:32,458
Has he became a police officer? 
Congratulations.

1475
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:37,129
Why are you tensed, brother-in-law? 
What happened?

1476
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:39,256
Nothing much brother-in-law,

1477
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:43,255
I've a friend, 
thinking cf doing a great job,

1478
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:46,629
to help a pair of lovers, 
acting as the groom's father,

1479
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:50,508
he want to the bride's house, 
ifs a factionist family,

1480
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:54,209
he's fearing the drama 
may be out any moment,

1481
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:55,877
what do you think will happen 
to him if the truth is cut?

1482
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,252
They'll hack him.

1483
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:00,593
Hack".? 
- Hack him.

1484
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,842
They'll hack because 
ifs a factionist family.

1485
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,463
It won't happen here, right? 
We live, eat and be happy together.

1486
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:10,593
Is it any TV snap?

1487
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:15,756
If anyone does here, I'll cut his legs 
and smash his head to ground.

1488
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:21,133
That's it.- Why do you befriend such 
insolent people?

1489
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,344
Foul, he's a damn Incl.

1490
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,501
He'll never listen to good advice.

1491
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:26,756
His fate, what can we do?

1492
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:41,468
Where are you going, brother-in-law?

1493
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,967
Still awake'?

1494
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,001
My fate!

1495
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:48,504
Locks like you've packed and leaving.

1496
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:51,753
I go! a call from office.

1497
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:53,130
Need to go urgently, can'! avoid it.

1498
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,504
I think you're angry, 
somebody has troubled you.

1499
00:28:56,708 --> 00:29:00,008
Tell me who is it, 
I'll hack him to death.

1500
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,253
Why do you repeat that 
word 'Hack' so many times?

1501
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:06,458
Does your son know 
that you're going?

1502
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:09,253
He'll not let me go if I tall him. 
He loves me to death.

1503
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,127
Where are you going daddy?

1504
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:17,004
Are you going away without 
informing me, daddy?

1505
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,834
Son-in-law, your dad is angry, 
take him to room and pacify.

1506
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,344
No need to go to roam, 
he'll do it here only.

1507
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,379
Came daddy. 
- I'll not come.- Come I say!

1508
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:34,711
Pacify him strongly, he must think 
of leaving without infoming again.

1509
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:42,710
Shall we start?

1510
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:52,503
You say there's no other choice. 
- No daddy.

1511
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:55,006
Should I've to cancel all meetings? 
- Yes daddy.

1512
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:57,127
What a great affectionate 
father and son!

1513
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:59,335
I can understand your pain, 
my dear son.

1514
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,877
Looks like he pacified you quickly.

1515
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,335
Quickly? He took time, right'? 
I'll not go anywhere.

1516
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:09,584
For safer side, sleep with your dad.

1517
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:13,378
Use me, come.

1518
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:23,094
Excuse me.....excuse me...

1519
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:27,708
No...I've seen you somewhere.

1520
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:30,380
Where did I see him'!

1521
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,843

1523
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,878
You got shocked reading 
that news, right? He's that man.

1524
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,882
You mean he is... 
- My father.

1525
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:50,254
The girl you love in city? 
- Your second grand daughter Indu.

1526
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,218
If you're shocked to hear this,

1527
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:54,969
how would I be going 
through it, grandpa?

1528
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:57,969
You scripted this drama.

1529
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:00,468
The and is also in your hands.

1530
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:04,960
What's there to tell you? 
Follow my foot steps.- What?

00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:08,754
I mean you must marry both...

1532
00:31:08,958 --> 00:31:11,632
Bloody old man! So many wrong 
ideas at this age also!

1533
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:13,631

Haw do I appear to you?

1535
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:21,135

Lord Krishna in Brindavanam.

If they dance with me, 
won't the pulse rate rise?

1540
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:46,507
Give yourself to me...

Beauty on one side".

00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:28,043
When is your son coming?

1568
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:31,011
That is... 
- They're children.

1569
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:33,798
There will be little tiffs in love.

1570
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,753
Tell him to come quickly, 
Indu is also my daughter.

1571
00:35:36,917 --> 00:35:39,261
Let's fix lndu's engagement 
also along with Bhumi.

1572
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:45,046
Brother, beat...heat... 
I'll definitely catch it.

1573
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,752
If you catch it, I'll kill you.

1574
00:35:47,542 --> 00:35:48,259
What's it dad?

1575
00:35:48,417 --> 00:35:52,376
When you told me everything 
locked so easy?

1576
00:35:52,542 --> 00:35:55,921
But I fear seeing the 
tum of events here.

1577
00:35:56,542 --> 00:35:58,260
What's the end to this?

1578
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:05,417
They're happy trusting me, 
they must be happy when I go.

1579
00:36:07,542 --> 00:36:11,797
I'm sad because you hath are 
struggling here for me.

1580
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,297
I don'! like it, dad.

1581
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:17,048
Our happiness is where you are!

1582
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:19,295
We'll live watching you, son.

1583
00:36:21,417 --> 00:36:26,298
Doctor, I've body pains like 
a road roller run over me.

1584
00:36:34,542 --> 00:36:37,625
Oh no! I've not seen anything, 
I don'! know anything.

1585
00:36:44,292 --> 00:36:46,135
Did they enter his room?

1586
00:37:02,917 --> 00:37:05,420
Younger uncle called. 
- What?

1587
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:07,502
Younger uncle called you.

1588
00:37:12,542 --> 00:37:13,759
He's downstairs says urgent.

1589
00:37:13,917 --> 00:37:17,672
Did you call me? 
- Nut me uncle, younger uncle.

1590
00:37:22,792 --> 00:37:24,760
Why did you call me? 
- Nu, I didn't call you, brother.

1591
00:37:24,917 --> 00:37:26,794
Then call him now, uncle.

1592
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:31,422
Ara you making fun of us? 
What's going on?

1593
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:35,626
Kill me or do anything but nobody 
must enter this room, uncle.

1594
00:37:35,792 --> 00:37:37,794
Why? 
- Nothing uncle.

1595
00:37:37,917 --> 00:37:41,171
You rogue! What's happening inside?

1596
00:37:52,542 --> 00:37:54,886
Are you three inside?

1597
00:38:01,792 --> 00:38:06,548
All the three are discussing inside, 
are you suspecting them?

1598
00:38:07,292 --> 00:38:08,669
Uncle, slap me.

1599
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:11,259
Shut up!

1600
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:18,426
You hath are not able to talk in home, 
so I planned this outing.

1601
00:38:18,917 --> 00:38:22,547
It's been many days since 
I saw Bhumi so happy.

1602
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:34,925
You scratched me once and 
I'm in deep trouble now,

1603
00:38:35,042 --> 00:38:36,794
if you scratch me again I don't 
know where would I end up.

1604
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,301
He's sending you with courage but 
keeping fear with him staying back.

1605
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,753
But once you dared 
to touch Bhumi,

1606
00:40:36,917 --> 00:40:40,296
this is not the fear 
I'd like to see in you.

1607
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:02,386
This fear is also no! enough.

1608
00:41:21,417 --> 00:41:26,048
How could you forget that 
I would be with Bhumi?

1609
00:42:12,167 --> 00:42:14,044
Why did you stop? 
Come on dare touch her!

1610
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:16,799
Touch her, blood idiot!

1611
00:43:25,667 --> 00:43:30,377
Before thinking about Bhumi again, 
tell him to think about me.

1612
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:33,048
The thought would die down.

1613
00:44:00,167 --> 00:44:06,925
I thought people at home were mad 
to believe that you both are lovers.

1614
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:12,176
Bu! for sometime 
I too believed it.

1615
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:15,045
That's my involvement in character.

1616
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:37,677
Till now it was your uncle only, 
I thought of winning him easily.

1617
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:39,760
But they are new three!

1618
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,426
His younger brother, 
and above all that city boy.

1619
00:44:44,792 --> 00:44:46,419
We can't win, son.

1620
00:44:46,875 --> 00:44:48,127
Forget Bhumi.

1621
00:44:53,125 --> 00:44:55,799
I thought you were my strength till now.

1622
00:44:56,042 --> 00:44:59,125
II turns into fear and advises me 
to leave Bhumi,

1623
00:44:59,667 --> 00:45:03,126
I'll start hacking from this house.

1624
00:45:04,042 --> 00:45:06,386
Now I know their strength.

1625
00:45:07,375 --> 00:45:11,130
I wan! to know their weakness.

1626
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,798
It looks like had omen.

1627
00:45:17,417 --> 00:45:18,919
Why are you hers? Come.

1628
00:45:19,625 --> 00:45:24,426
Why all these arrangements 
for a fake engagement?

1629
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:25,626
I'll not come, you go.

1630
00:45:25,792 --> 00:45:29,501
If you don't came, your duplicate son 
will take you to the room.

1631
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:31,002
You're right, let's go.

1632
00:45:40,542 --> 00:45:42,385
Sir, please exchange the proposals.

1633
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:45,547
Take it brother.

1634
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,627
Take it brother. 
- Okay.

1635
00:45:56,667 --> 00:46:01,047
Anyway ifs your kinsman is 
giving, you too join him.

1636
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:04,296
You too have to receive again. 
- Go ahead.

1637
00:46:04,417 --> 00:46:06,670
Please came sir, it'll give me supper!.

1638
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,172
You move.

1639
00:46:11,542 --> 00:46:13,886
He's shivering in happiness.

1640
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:19,378
May the bride and groom 
exchange the rings.

1641
00:46:27,917 --> 00:46:29,043
Cams an exchange.

1642
00:46:40,625 --> 00:46:45,426
Why just engagement now? 
Why not fix marriage immediately?

1643
00:46:55,917 --> 00:46:59,251
A man like him with you, 
I don'! have to worry about you.

1644
00:47:00,292 --> 00:47:03,045
You wanted to study, right'? 
Go ahead.

1645
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:04,923
You don'! have any problem, right?

1646
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:10,926
I'll fix marriage when ever you 
both come and tell me.

1647
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,001
Thank God!

1648
00:47:17,792 --> 00:47:20,921
How tensed we were for this? 
It's all over.

1649
00:47:22,792 --> 00:47:25,170
From here your life is yours 
and my life is mine.

1650
00:47:25,292 --> 00:47:26,794
You goto America for studies,

1651
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,799
call your father from there, 
Krish cheated me,

1652
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,502
and tell him you'll not marry him.

1653
00:47:31,667 --> 00:47:34,921
They'll think I'm a cheat. 
I don't have anything to lose.

1654
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:39,301
Alter that if not of my range, 
you'll find a scapegoat,

1655
00:47:40,292 --> 00:47:41,635
that was just fun,

1656
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:44,169
Bhumi, you'll definitely get a good man,

1657
00:47:44,542 --> 00:47:45,885
you will he happy.

1658
00:48:13,292 --> 00:48:16,011
Why did you come into my life?

1659
00:48:17,542 --> 00:48:23,003
I can't hear the thought that you'll 
not be with me from tomorrow.

1660
00:48:23,875 --> 00:48:26,799
I can'! stop myself from 
telling you this, Krish.

1661
00:48:27,667 --> 00:48:31,297
Till now nobody ever thought 
about me like you.

1662
00:48:32,167 --> 00:48:33,794
Nobody will aver think too.

1663
00:48:35,542 --> 00:48:40,799
In these few days I've seen 
what really life is.

1664
00:48:52,167 --> 00:48:54,010
Promise me Krish.

1665
00:48:54,625 --> 00:48:59,631
After going from here, 
never again show up in my life.

1666
00:49:28,667 --> 00:49:33,298
I've come to know that there 
is breathtaking sorrow...

1667
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:39,758
It time can stop, 
let it stop this moment...

1668
00:49:43,292 --> 00:49:45,920
If lava had a heart and 
if it had voice...

1669
00:49:48,125 --> 00:49:53,757
If it seas me in this situation, 
it won't keep quiet...

1670
00:49:56,167 --> 00:50:00,752
Is love a crime? 
Is love a burden?

1671
00:50:00,917 --> 00:50:05,627
Is it silence of heart? Tell me...

1672
00:50:05,792 --> 00:50:10,502
My dear...eternal bond...

1673
00:50:10,667 --> 00:50:15,753
Are you a hell? O my love...

1674
00:50:18,542 --> 00:50:20,670
Brother, hit it.

1675
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:33,129
If you get too much involved in 
the character, it's trouble.

1676
00:50:40,042 --> 00:50:44,673
Why were you un-moved when 
Bhumi opened her heart to you?

1677
00:50:52,625 --> 00:50:54,127
Why did you stop?

1678
00:50:55,417 --> 00:50:57,135
Did I come before you?

1679
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:40,006
If you hadn't sent Krish hare, 
this wouldn't! have happened.

1680
00:51:42,375 --> 00:51:47,051
I'm thinking cl giving Krish to you.

1681
00:51:48,625 --> 00:51:49,877
What's your idea?

1682
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:55,877
You're proud of sending 
your boy friend with me.

1683
00:51:56,875 --> 00:51:58,297
Are you giving him to me?

1684
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:02,676
In fact I'm giving my future 
husband to you.

1685
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:08,049
Take care of Krish.

1686
00:52:16,625 --> 00:52:19,549
Why are you crying now?

1687
00:52:27,792 --> 00:52:34,926
I'm realising now how painful 
is to leave the one you love.

1688
00:52:36,292 --> 00:52:39,296
It would've been better 
if I wasn't! aware of it,

1689
00:52:40,167 --> 00:52:43,546
but I know it.

1690
00:52:45,042 --> 00:52:46,794
What did he say?

1691
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:52,507
I dun'! mind if people here think me 
as a cheat after going from here,

1692
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,753
but ifs enough if you're happy,

1693
00:52:57,125 --> 00:53:04,794
he totally forgot that after marrying me 
he must come to the same home.

1694
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,049
What is your lover in city'?

1695
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:38,300
Uncle that is... 
- Isn't! it Krishna who cheated you?

1696
00:53:53,167 --> 00:53:54,009
Get cut!

1697
00:53:57,167 --> 00:54:00,011
How dare you enter this home! 
Get out!

1698
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:07,928
Are you suspecting Krishna 
trusting this man?

1699
00:54:08,792 --> 00:54:11,921
Thay're jealous cf such a fine 
man becoming our sun-in-law.

1700
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:15,797
He was responsible for you 
to come to this home.

1701
00:54:15,917 --> 00:54:18,295
He's the man who united us.

1702
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:19,501
He is...

1703
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:29,381
I trust him more than myself.

1704
00:54:30,167 --> 00:54:31,635
Only him.

1705
00:54:31,792 --> 00:54:33,419
Do you know what is he saying?

1706
00:54:35,167 --> 00:54:38,046
It seems they're not your parents, 
they are your parents.

1707
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:53,377
It seems you cheated Indu with Iovs,

1708
00:54:53,542 --> 00:54:55,510
and you came here to act 
as Bhumi's lover,

1709
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:57,169
what are they blabbering?

1710
00:54:57,375 --> 00:54:59,798
Tell what are you In them.

1711
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,796
Tell them all are blatant Lies.

1712
00:55:00,917 --> 00:55:02,919
What he said is true. 
-All are lies...

1713
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:08,422
Ha's right.

1714
00:55:23,292 --> 00:55:24,418
Father!

1715
00:55:27,667 --> 00:55:29,795
We though! you're our man.

1716
00:55:33,042 --> 00:55:36,922
How dare you cheat people 
who trusted you like God.

1717
00:55:40,625 --> 00:55:42,627
Uncle, please stop!

1718
00:55:43,792 --> 00:55:48,923
You hid your lover in this house 
and said he ran way,

1719
00:55:49,042 --> 00:55:52,125
you've lost the right to speak.

1720
00:55:52,292 --> 00:55:54,169
Uncle... 
- Shut up!

1721
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:04,920
Father, please stop him.

1722
00:56:06,542 --> 00:56:11,298
Please father, tall him to stop. 
- How could you think of cheating me?

1723
00:56:20,875 --> 00:56:22,548
Tall him to stop brother-in-law, 
he may die.

1724
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:25,424
Let him die.

1725
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,301
I told you to came here 
after inquiring about me.

1726
00:56:39,542 --> 00:56:42,671
Bhumi is and will always be mine.

1727
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:51,172
I swear on my mother,

1728
00:56:52,292 --> 00:56:55,045
I swear on the desire you've for Bhumi,

1729
00:56:56,625 --> 00:57:01,301
come what so ever it may, 
I'll not let you have Bhumi.

1730
00:57:02,542 --> 00:57:04,169
Forget her!

1731
00:57:08,292 --> 00:57:10,511
One more word about Bhumi...

1732
00:57:14,625 --> 00:57:17,048
I thought you reformed me 
into a good man.

1733
00:57:17,542 --> 00:57:19,670
Did you cheat ma?

1734
00:57:34,167 --> 00:57:39,924
I was eager to see you both 
joining together to beat someone.

1735
00:57:40,292 --> 00:57:44,172
But if I knew you would beat him,

1736
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,629
I wouldn't! have let! you both unite.

1737
00:57:48,417 --> 00:57:49,259
Father, he...

1738
00:57:49,417 --> 00:57:55,003
Beat me first before touching him.

1739
00:57:56,417 --> 00:58:02,129
Hay, fearing your daughter's 
life getting ruined,

1740
00:58:02,292 --> 00:58:06,547
he's here for one lie I told you.

1741
00:58:10,542 --> 00:58:14,001
Father, he's the cheat who 
ditched my daughter in city.

1742
00:58:14,167 --> 00:58:17,421
In fact it was your daughter 
who sent him here.

1743
00:58:21,625 --> 00:58:24,299
He's playing with Bhumi's 
life now, father.

1744
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:27,136
He's a cheat, father. 
- Who is cheat?

1745
00:58:27,292 --> 00:58:30,421
Do you think he's here for your property? 
To cheat you.

1746
00:58:30,542 --> 00:58:34,001
All our property together isn't 
worth a percent of his wealth.

1747
00:58:34,167 --> 00:58:36,670
He's heir to thousands of cores.

1748
00:58:40,667 --> 00:58:46,049
Leaving his comfortable life there, 
he came here for your daughter,

1749
00:58:46,667 --> 00:58:51,628
he turned this mad house into 
a celestial Brindavanam.

1750
00:59:01,542 --> 00:59:05,922
What did you say? 
Is he playing with Bhumi's life?

1751
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:09,797
Your daughter loves him.

1752
00:59:13,625 --> 00:59:17,255
You wanted to hate him 
yet you started loving him.

1753
00:59:17,417 --> 00:59:19,135
Your daughter is nothing.

1754
00:59:22,042 --> 00:59:25,797
There's no human or heart 
that won't love him.

1755
00:59:25,917 --> 00:59:27,134
He's like that!.

1756
00:59:32,042 --> 00:59:38,425
This home tasted love because of 
him but we made him bleed here,

1757
00:59:38,917 --> 00:59:41,761
if you can please forgive us.

1758
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,299
Brother! He's taking away Bhumi!

1759
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,673
Nu! anyone of us,

1760
01:00:00,292 --> 01:00:02,294
He must go for Bhumi.

1761
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:16,176
Grandson, you promised to go 
after completing the mission.

1762
01:00:16,375 --> 01:00:19,174
Go...bring back Bhumi.

1763
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,923
I like your commitment

1764
01:01:07,167 --> 01:01:10,922
But bloody fate I came between.

1765
01:01:11,667 --> 01:01:14,420
What! you desire is here, 
come and take her, bloody!

1766
01:01:16,292 --> 01:01:19,546
Come...come...come..

1767
01:02:25,667 --> 01:02:28,796
You wanted her, right? 
Come on get up, bloody!

1768
01:02:43,792 --> 01:02:48,298
Come...Come...Come... 
if you miss now, you'll never get her.

1769
01:02:52,542 --> 01:02:54,886
Gs! up...get up...

1770
01:03:03,375 --> 01:03:06,379
Come...come..come..
- Na...no...

1771
01:03:09,542 --> 01:03:15,879
If you get confidence of getting Bhumi 
taking on me, come for her.

1772
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,510
I'll kill.

1773
01:03:17,792 --> 01:03:21,171
Not your confidences bu! you.

1774
01:03:49,167 --> 01:03:56,426
She loves him and 
she too loves him.

1775
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,753
Who is in your heart, grandson?

1776
01:04:03,292 --> 01:04:07,422
How can he tell? 
Elder son, you tell.

1777
01:04:07,542 --> 01:04:11,922
How do I know? Ask him.

1778
01:04:12,125 --> 01:04:14,924
Tall him. 
- Me?-Yes you.

1779
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:18,548
They're saying no. 
How can we say?

1780
01:04:18,667 --> 01:04:21,136
It has to be decided by those three only.

1781
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:41,760
Gel up, let's go to temple.

1782
01:04:42,167 --> 01:04:43,419
Why should I come to temple?

1783
01:04:43,542 --> 01:04:47,797
Why do we go to a temple? 
If we are facing any problem, we go.

1784
01:04:49,292 --> 01:04:51,920
God, I said why should I go 
to temple in arrogance,

1785
01:04:52,417 --> 01:04:54,044
why did you bring me 
to your feet like this, lord?

1786
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:55,172
~

1787
01:05:00,125 --> 01:05:04,005
Lord! How come you're here? 
- What happened, son?

1788
01:05:04,167 --> 01:05:07,376
You know everything but 
asking me so coolly,

1789
01:05:07,542 --> 01:05:08,668
whats all this, Lord?

1790
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:13,631
It'll he like this initially, 
slowly you get used to it.

1791
01:05:13,792 --> 01:05:16,636
Get used to it'? 
it's very difficult, lord.

1792
01:05:16,792 --> 01:05:19,921
Anyway you're hare, lard. 
Find a solution to my problem.

1793
01:05:20,792 --> 01:05:22,135
Solution?

1794
01:05:24,417 --> 01:05:28,797
Lord...Lord...l asked for solution 
and you vanished.

1795
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,503
Does he mean...oh no!

1796
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,253
This Govinda is trapped...

1797
01:05:45,292 --> 01:05:47,670
Dance...dance...anode...

1798
01:05:47,875 --> 01:05:50,674
It'll bring fun and excitement...

1799
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:05,003
Hot romance will bloom... 
If you break into a jig...

1800
01:06:05,167 --> 01:06:07,295
The world must get shattered...

1801
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:11,550
If you colour the town with red 
with your romance..

1802
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:16,005
It must create a sensation...

1803
01:06:16,167 --> 01:06:20,297
When all directions merge 
in one place to have fun...

1804
01:06:20,417 --> 01:06:23,045
Stars join the fun...

1805
01:06:26,792 --> 01:06:28,920
Happiness that can make 
you go mad...

1806
01:06:29,125 --> 01:06:33,756
Our hearts are shaking 
with happiness...
