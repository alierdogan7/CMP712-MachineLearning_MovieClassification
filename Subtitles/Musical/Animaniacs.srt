358
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:18,767
* We won't let it get us down
We're Californians *

359
00:20:18,767 --> 00:20:21,267
* A quake *
* A quake *

360
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:23,300
* It's time
To pull up stake *

361
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,133
* We're all fed up
We can't deny it *

362
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:26,634
* Fires quakes
And floods and riot *

363
00:20:26,634 --> 00:20:29,067
ALL:
* We want some place
With peace and quiet *

364
00:20:29,067 --> 00:20:32,067
* So we're moving to Beirut *

365
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:34,834
[***]

366
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:41,367
[***]

367
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:05,501
ALL:
Go nuts!
