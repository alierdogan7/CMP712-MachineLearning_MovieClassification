Barbara will remain here with us.

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,649
Now, none of your Rabelaisian lip.
This girl has led a very sheltered life.

173
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,089
As if I ever said anything that would raise
a faint blush on the cheek of...

174
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,642
Looks like she stood you up.
Nice goings-on, I must say.

175
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,768
Here she is. Hey.

176
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,684
Why don't you go all the way in?
Maybe she's down the cellar.

177
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,843
- That's funny.
- At least she left you the car.

178
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,242
- Sometimes they don't even do that.
- She must be someplace.

179
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:58,963
- Come on, let's go on in.
- When you find her, yell. We'll be at the bar.

180
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,443
Now, let her go, lad. Better fish in the sea.

181
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,525
You know, this reminds me
of an experience I had in Kansas City.

182
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,650
I met this little lady.
Very fine and very demure.

183
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,200
Mr Wu, you oughta be ashamed.

184
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,602
<i>(thunder)</i>

185
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,802
<i>(Tommy hums a tune)</i>

186
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,370
- Just like a lullaby, eh, Colonel?
- Hmm.

187
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,363
A Chinese lullaby.

188
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:00,726
- Oh, there you are, Mr Randall, sir.
- Little Lord Fauntleroy.

189
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,441
- Go away. I don't want to talk to you.
- Your car. We must get it aboard.

190
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,923
- The captain's holding up the boat, sir.
- All on account of you, Atkins.

191
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,606
You're a heedless, thoughtless butterfly.

192
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,684
No consideration for others. No...

193
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,206
I thought so.
Colonel, this man's been drinking.

194
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,567
Please, sir, we must hurry, sir. Now, please.

195
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,563
See here.

196
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,440
- Steady, Atkins, steady.
- Now, Tommy, we mustn't be too harsh.

197
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,286
I used to have an uncle that drank.
It's a madness in the blood.

198
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,442
Please, sir, I can walk for myself, sir.

199
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,206
You'll be all right,
but you mustn't shout like that.

200
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,001
We'll get you back on the boat
safe and sound.

201
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,771
It's quite all right.
I can really get there myself.

202
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,491
- It's quite all right.
- Get in there.

203
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:52,124
- Get in, Tommy, and hold him there.
- No, sir, I'm not drunk, I assure you.

204
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,283
- Are you sober enough to drive?
- Look out.

205
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,522
<i>(ship's whistle)</i>

206
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,529
<i>(Mr Wu yaps)</i>

207
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,407
- I could've sworn I heard something.
- I bet it's a stowaway.

208
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,528
Who's there?

209
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,851
If there's anybody down here, let's find them.

210
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,763
<i>(rattling)</i>

211
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,525
You search behind the sacks. You too.

212
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,126
You check behind the cars.

213
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,762
Steward! Steward!

214
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,286
We found a stowaway in the hold,
but he got away.

215
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,408
Very well.

216
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,769
Jenkins, spread a general alarm.
We seem to have stowaways aboard.

217
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,320
At once, sir.

218
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,082
<i>(bell)</i>

219
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,162
Come in.

220
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,370
- Right there, steward.
- Yes, missy.

221
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,125
You were told to watch for stowaways
before we sailed.

222
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,682
- I did, sir.
- Well, if we find one, you'll be out of a job.

223
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,641
You can come back for these things
in half an hour, steward.

224
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,848
And, mind you, he was only 12.

225
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:03,403
Richard spoke up as quick as a flash,
and what do you think he said, Susan?

226
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,608
"You may use my bicycle, Geraldine."

227
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,288
"I love sport, but I love
the principles of manhood more."

228
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,967
- I'm afraid I'm boring you.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs Hope.

229
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:19,251
- Richard told me that story three times.
- I tell it not because Richard is my son.

230
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:24,087
I tell it merely because I believe that you,
as his future wife, might be interested.

231
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,128
Apparently, I was mistaken.

232
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,330
Mark my words, Susan, the time will come
when you'll be just as devoted to Richard...

233
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,562
But I am devoted to him. Only...

234
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,884
Only you have a peculiar way
of demonstrating your devotion.

235
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,729
Who is in there?

236
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,965
<i>(Mr Wu growls)</i>

237
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,848
<i>(screams)</i>

238
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,649
Help! Help!

239
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,404
- Help!
- What happened?

240
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,051
- There's a man in there.
- What's up?

241
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,168
- The stowaway.
- He growled at me.

242
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,410
- <i>(door rattles)</i>
- Come out.

243
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,165
Come out of there or I'll blow you out.

244
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,642
Well, I'll be...

245
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,969
- Aw, the poor little thing. We frightened her.
- She's frightened us.

246
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,601
- What's your name?
- In Chinese or American?

247
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,920
What?

248
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,562
In American it's Barbara Stewart.
But in Chinese it's Ching-Ching.

249
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,371
- What are you doing here?
- Hiding.

250
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,841
Hiding? Why?

251
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,651
The man said I was a stowaway.

252
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:46,251
- Well, are you?
- I... I guess so. What's a stowaway?

253
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,564
- How did you ever get on this ship, anyway?
- I don't know.

254
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,089
I never heard of such a thing in all my life.
I can't understand it.

255
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,130
- Neither can I.
- Oh, please don't be impertinent.

256
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,046
- She didn't mean to be. Did you, dear?
- No, I didn't.

257
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,327
- What's all this?
- We found the stowaway.

258
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,164
- Where is he?
- It's a she, sir.

259
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,242
It's this child here.

260
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,124
What, you?

261
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,285
I guess so.

262
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,522
She doesn't even know how she got aboard.

263
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,047
- What am I gonna do with you, young lady?
- I'll look after her.

264
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,885
- Susan, don't be absurd.
- She won't be any trouble.

265
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,000
Fine, Miss Parker. Bring her to my quarters
after lunch and we'll have a talk with her.

266
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,845
- You can return to your post now, Jenkins.
- Aye, sir.

267
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,491
See you later, stowaway.

268
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,562
<i>(Mr Wu barks)</i>

269
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,287
Captain, can we put this... animal
in the kennel?

270
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,725
Oh!

271
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,724
They'll take good care of it.
You'll give it a big dinner.

272
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:00,807
Why, of course I will. Here.
Don't you worry, I'll take care of it.

273
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,607
It isn't an it, sir. It's a him.

274
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,570
I've never had a dress as nice as this.

275
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,529
The ship's store is full of them.

276
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:19,128
All you have to do is get this one dirty
and we'll find you another one.

277
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,568
Do you think your mother
will like me better now I look beautiful?

278
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,371
- Mrs Hope isn't my mother.
- No?

279
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,442
Well, that is, not yet.

280
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,649
- See?
- Yes, I see.

281
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,291
It's time we turned the child
over to the captain.

282
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,409
After all, charity has its limits.

283
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,883
What did you mean when you said you didn't
know how you got on this ship? You must.

284
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,042
But I don't, honestly.

285
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,250
The last thing I remember
is that I fell asleep in Uncle Tommy's car.

286
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,721
Uncle Tommy? Tommy who?

287
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,280
Randall. Tommy Randall.

288
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:58,331
<i>- (both)</i> Tommy Randall!
- Mm-hm.

289
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,086
- Your Uncle Tommy is on board this ship.
- He is?

290
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,322
I might've known you were his niece.

291
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,325
- He's a problem child too.
- I'll take you to him, Ching-Ching.

292
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,882
Considering his reputation,
you'd better turn her over to the captain.

293
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,962
Very well.

294
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,851
Well, it seems odd, but with Mr Randall,
nothing surprises me.

295
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:27,963
- Good morning, Captain.
- Good morning, Atkins.

296
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,720
- We'd like to see Mr Randall.
- Mr Randall's still asleep, sir.

297
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,691
- Well, it's about time he got up.
- Mr Randall never gets up until two, sir.

298
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:41,049
<i>(laughs)</i> I'm sorry, but this is important,
so you'd better call him.

299
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,160
- Mr Randall will be very annoyed, sir.
- Tell him a pretty lady wants to see him.

300
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,246
- If I know Tommy Randall, that'll get him up.
- Yes, I'm afraid it will, sir.

301
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,329
Won't you be seated, please?

302
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,767
- I beg your pardon, sir.
- <i>(snoring)</i>

303
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:09,084
- I beg your pardon, sir!
- Go away, Fauntleroy.

304
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,367
Sorry, but there's a young lady to see you.

305
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,330
- Huh?
- There's a young lady to see you.

306
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,290
I think it's rather urgent.

307
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,489
- That's bad.
- She's very beautiful, sir.

308
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,244
Oh?

309
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,324
- Well, that's not so bad.
- She has a child with her, sir.

310
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,323
Oh, that is bad.

311
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,563
She also has the captain with her.
He insists on seeing you.

312
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,642
That's very bad.

313
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,210
Here you are, sir.

314
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,851
- What's that?
- Your chequebook, sir.

315
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,922
Oh...

316
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,564
I don't know what your game is,
but I never saw you before.

317
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,610
I have witnesses to my whereabouts
for the past 27 years.

318
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,445
- Mr Randall!
- Uncle Tommy!

319
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:59,004
Ching-Ching. What on earth...? Please forgive
me, I'm awfully sorry. I'm not quite awake yet.

320
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,923
What are you doing on this boat?

321
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,651
I'm a stowaway, but I didn't mean to be.

322
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,645
- I waited in your automobile like you said.
- But I went out and looked for you.

323
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,326
Well, you see, after a while, it started to rain.

324
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,131
So I got in the back
and pulled the cover down.

325
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,248
Oh, you poor kid.

326
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,081
- I'm awfully sorry.
- But I like being a stowaway, Uncle Tommy.

327
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,084
This is Susan Parker, my best friend.

328
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,527
He's my best friend too.

329
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,171
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

330
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:34,007
- Don't you think she's stravagant?
- She's magnificent.

331
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,889
Oh, thank you.

332
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,124
- Charming little niece you have, Mr Randall.
- I'm not really his niece, Susan.

333
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,248
- He's just pretending.
- Why...?

334
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,369
- But aren't you the child's uncle?
- No.

335
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,647
We met in Shanghai yesterday.

336
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,122
- Oh, Ching-Ching, you told me...
- I didn't mean to tell a fib.

337
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,602
I was just scared, and I knew
Uncle Tommy would help me.

338
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,366
You know I will. I'm sorry, Captain,
to have caused all this trouble.

339
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,411
I'll accept full responsibility.
I'll be only too glad to pay for her passage.

340
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,847
I'll have to communicate with her people.

341
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,244
From what she tells me, she has no people.
In fact, she has all the earmarks of a waif.

342
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,688
But she must have someone.
She didn't live in China by herself.

343
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,969
I lived with the Kruikshanks,
but they won't care if I stay here.

344
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:20,045
- Who are the Kruikshanks, dear?
- They're missionaries in Sanchow.

345
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,841
Make a note of that name and get in touch
through the American consul.

346
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,208
In the meantime, I'll look after her.
This time, I really mean it.

347
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,887
I'm inclined to think that Miss Parker
is better company for the child.

348
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,691
Oh, he's good company too.

349
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,047
Maybe you had better go with Miss Parker.

350
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,806
You can call her Susan like I do.
Can't he, Susan?

351
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,121
Well, I suppose so.

352
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,202
I'll see you later, then, Ching-Ching.

353
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,205
- And I hope you too... Susan.
- Thank you.

354
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,523
- Bye, Uncle Tommy.
- Goodbye, darling.

355
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,001
Goodbye, Uncle Tommy.

356
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,481
Goodbye, Uncle Tommy.

357
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,562

00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,809
- I can't understand it, Atkins.
- Understand what, sir?

360
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,689
Your gross neglect of your duties.

361
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,288
The most beautiful girl in the world
is on this ship and you never told me.

362
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:29,651
Begging your pardon, sir,
but you don't usually have to be told.

363
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,082
- Who is she?
- You met her mother on Monday night.

364
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,242
- I did?
- Unhappily, sir.

365
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,804
I...

366
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,281
- I didn't...?
- You did, sir.

367
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,724
Let me have it, Atkins.

368
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,929
You emptied a bottle of champagne
in her lap, sir.

369
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,002
Oh!

Now, now, come, come, Atkins.
You can do better than that.

374
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,081
- You're not even trying.
- I thought it was rather good, sir.

375
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,085
Perhaps you can suggest something else
that I can imitate better.

376
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,162
Well, let me see...

377
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,647
- Sleepy?
- Mm-hm.

378
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:30,481
It's not ten yet. You'll never be popular
if you fold up right after dinner.

379
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,564
Begging your pardon, sir,

380
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:37,447
but I think it's customary
for little children to retire rather early.

381
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,922
- Is it really your bedtime, Ching-Ching?
- Mm-hm.

382
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,607
- Atkins, prepare Miss Ching-Ching for bed.
- Me, sir?

383
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,445
- I don't know anything about children.
- I've never...

384
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,922
- There's a first time for everything.
- Sir, this is very awkward.

385
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,005
Please, Uncle Tommy, I can undress myself.
I always do.

386
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:59,165
- I wish I could say the same.
- Oh, thank you, Miss.

387
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,402
Now, you close your eyes. Come on.
Atkins, a lullaby for Miss Ching-Ching.

388
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,371
- A what, sir?
- A lullaby.

389
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,651
- You know, a vocal Mickey Finn.
- Sir, I can't sing a lullaby.

390
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,724
You're one of the most untalented persons
I've ever met.

391
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,282
Can't do imitations or sing.
How do you ever entertain your friends?

392
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,682

Yes, everything is here. Including you.

Yes, but not the right two.

- We're to be married there.
- Mm-hm? And why Bangkok?

453
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,771
He lives there. He's with an exporting firm.

454
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,890
- Exporting what?
- Oh, ivory, apes, peacocks.

455
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:01,002
Things like that. He came out here
two years ago and he's worked very hard.

456
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:06,371
You mean to say you've been engaged for two
years and you haven't seen him in that time?

You Latins.
What a hot-blooded race you are!

458
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,561
Well, Richard isn't quite like that. We've
known each other since we were children.

459
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,883
Oh, I see.
Well, I must say, it all sounds very lyrical.

460
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:22,170
- Well, it may not be exactly lyrical.
- Me, of course, I've never been engaged.

461
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,402
Not definitely, that is.

462
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,290
- But if I were to be...
- Not definitely is right.

463
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,727
I seem to recall something
in the newspapers:

464
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,804
"Millionaire playboy
sued for breach of promise."

465
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,362
I practically won that suit.
She only got $10,000.

466
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,807
Poor kid, she'd been counting on 50.

467
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,601
$10,000?
That's more than Richard earns in a year.

468
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:47,971
Well, you shouldn't be so narrow. After all,
I can't help it if I've been cursed with wealth.

469
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,681
Not that it isn't as nice a curse
as anyone could ask for.

470
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,491
- Have you ever worked for a living?
- Pardon?

471
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,006
You know, work. Like most people do.

472
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,129
Oh, work. Of course. I've worked my father...

473
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,885
Why should I take a job
from someone else who needs it?

474
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,965
I sacrifice myself
for the good of humanity. See?

475
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,327
Do you know what you are?

476
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,085
No, but I have a feeling
that you're about to tell me.

477
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:18,610
A museum piece. You should be in a glass
case in an exhibit of the terrible Twenties,

00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:23,242
cocktail shaker in your hand, shirt scrawled
with chorus girls' telephone numbers,

479
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,290
and a label - "Playboy BC, Before The Crash,

480
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,603
former habitat, Broadway, now extinct."

481
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,125
Hmm...

482
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,010
You don't exactly pull your punches, do you?

483
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:39,405
Would it please you to know that I feel
about that high and six years old?

484
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,962
You should grow up.
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

485
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,691
Oh, but forget it. At least forget it for now.

486
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,967
I'm really not a reformer always.

487
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,841
Anyway, beneath that too-smooth exterior
beats a heart of gold... I think.

488
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:57,209
- It's beating awfully fast right now.
- Good night.

Sing it. There's no one here but you and me.
And the China Sea.

491
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,888
But it's a love song.
Just doesn't fit the occasion.

492
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,646
That's all right. It's only a popular song.

00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,011
Not bad.

658
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:52,122
You precious little puppy, you.
You're just like Waify.

659
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,402
- Thank you, sir.
- Come on, Ching-Ching.

660
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,922
<i>(speaks Chinese)</i>

661
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,166
<i>(speaks Chinese)</i>

<i>(speaks Chinese)</i>

663
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,400
- He went that way.
- Thank you.

664
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,641
<i>(speaks Chinese)</i>

665
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:37,290
Well, Ching-Ching,
where do we go from here?

666
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,122
Hey, where'd you come from?

667
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,931
Ching-Ching! Ching-Ching!

668
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,727
<i>(speaks Chinese)</i>

669
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:55,241
No, wait, this is all a mistake.
Listen, be reasonable. Ching-Ching!

670
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,844
There you are, darling.

671
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,690
<i>(speaks Chinese)</i>

672
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,651
<i>- (speaks Chinese)</i>
- Wait. Give me a chance to explain.

673
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:12,682
If wishes were keys,
there would be no prisoners.

674
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,888
So Sun Lo says.

675
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:20,524
Good old Sun Lo,
always brightening the corner where he isn't.

676
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:24,002
It's been fun up till now,
but it won't be so funny if we miss that boat.

677
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,608
- I bet the captain will be pretty mad.
- He must be, or he'd be here by now.

678
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:33,447
We've gotta get out of here.
Well, I guess we'll have to start a rebellion.

679
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:39,926
Pardon me, would any of you gentlemen
be interested in getting out of this jail?

680
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,923
I said...

681
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,209
You speak to them.
Tell them about the great outside world.

682
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:50,207
- Ask them how they'd like to see it again.
- <i>(speaks Chinese)</i>

683
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,443
<i>(speaks Chinese)</i>

684
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,409
Well?

685
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,324
They're not interested.
They said they like it here.

686
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,801
That's absurd. Where's their spirit?

687
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,087
Ask them are they men or are they mice?

688
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:08,131
<i>(they speak Chinese)</i>

689
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,441
Mice.

690
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:15,128
Well, at last. Sorry to have caused you
so much trouble, Captain.

691
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,851
Now, see here, son.
I've been very lenient with you.

692
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:22,687
But there's a limit. You've overstepped it.
If it weren't for this child, I wouldn't be here.

693
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,441
- Any news about Ching-Ching?
- Sorry, Miss, not a word.

694
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,127
- Oh, I never should've left her with him.
- He should've known better.

695
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,410
It's an outrage taking a child of that age
out at night in a city like Hong Kong.

696
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,891
Anything could happen.

697
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,088
<i>(both)</i> ♪ indeed I do

698
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:42,403

00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,963
<i>(drunkenly)</i> Tommy, lad!
To the rescue. I need you.

700
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,771

701
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,842

702
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,764
We missed not having you, darling.

703
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:58,526
- Tommy, it was such a nice party.
- Glad you enjoyed yourselves.

704
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:03,925
Just the little matter of a taxi fare.
Could I impose on you?

705
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,402
- Don't tell me you've been robbed again.
- Clean.

706
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:10,962
Miss Parker. Miss Parker, here they come.

707
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:37,608
That's better. Nine and two are eleven.
Four and three are seven.

708
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,160
He thought I didn't have a card.
I trumped his ace.

709
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,766
You should've seen his face.
It was on a redouble.

710
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:48,722
- They play a lot of bridge in Bangkok?
- Great bridge town. We call it Bridgeport.

711
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:53,044
No, you're really very fortunate
moving in with our crowd.

712
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:58,206
Only last week, JB - JB Bradley, I mean -
said to me, "Dick." Calls me Dick for short.

713
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:01,568
"Dick," he said, "I'm sure your missis
is gonna like it here."

714
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:04,405
- You will, too.
- Oh, I know I will.

715
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,041
- Tell her about the house, Richard.
- Oh, yes.

716
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,930
But just a description of it
doesn't do it justice.

717
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,844
It's absolutely modern. Lots of closet space.

718
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,891
Fully equipped laundry. It's just as good
as any house in any American suburb.

719
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,247
And roomy too. I'll show you.

720
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:27,002
Kinda L-shaped. This is our room.

721
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,845
- This is Mother's room.
- Mother's?

722
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,845
Yes. Oh, you think she'd be
better off in this one?

723
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,890
<i>(Richard)</i> I don't know.

724
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,571
Bangkok is a very romantic city, isn't it?

725
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,689
There are a lot of old temples
and places like that.

726
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,525
But our colony doesn't bother
with the native things.

727
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:52,970
We have our own little set. Fine,
substantial people too. Bridge and tennis.

728
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,328
You know your opponents so well
you can tell in advance every move.

729
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,129
That must be interesting.

730
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,410
Susan! Susan!

731
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,847
You should be taking a nap,
you and your dolls.

732
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:10,643
My dolls are. Shut your eyes and put out
your hand. I've something for you.

733
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,007
All right.

734
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:16,801
- Susan, where did that come from?
- From Uncle Tommy.

735
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,326
- Who?
- Oh, I asked him not to buy it.

736
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,209
Look, he bought me a bracelet too.

737
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,887
- Why, that must've cost...
- $300. I saw the price tag.

738
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,568
$300! He wouldn't have spent that much
money if he hadn't felt you were interested.

739
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:33,406
- I don't think I need even answer that.
- You'll return it, won't you?

740
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:36,131
Certainly. I asked Mr Randall not to buy it.

741
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:39,568
- Shall I give back my bracelet too?
- No, darling.

742
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:44,168
I think you'd better go take your nap
or play or something.

743
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:48,004
Still, he might've meant it
as a wedding present.

744
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:52,847
In that case, there'd be no harm in your
keeping it. After all, it did cost quite a lot.

745
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:58,727
Will my boy be happy with a girl like that?

746
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,804
- Sometimes I wonder.
- Of course I will, Mother.

747
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:04,247
- Why do you say that?
- Oh, I don't know.

748
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:07,005
Susan seems to have changed
a great deal lately.

749
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:10,084
She'll be all right after we're married.

750
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:18,246
Well, it's about time we declared an armistice.

751
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,402
I've been feeling terrible, Susan.

752
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:25,168
Well, this is very pretty,
but of course I can't accept it.

753
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,406
Take back your baubles, is that it?

754
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:32,882
Listen, Susan, I think you're being very...

755
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,531
What, is it as bad as all that?

756
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:40,288
- Don't you like me any more?
- That has nothing to do with it.

757
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,886
Well, don't you?

758
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,088
Not particularly.

759
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:10,161
You know what you tell me:
keep your chin up and you'll be OK.

760
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:16,047
As Sun Lo says, the strongest man
in the world cannot lift a heavy heart.

761
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,646
Why is your heart heavy?

762
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,688
You know that Mr Hope?

763
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,081
Well, Susan's gonna marry him.

764
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,400
Oh!

765
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,007
She'll have Mrs Hope for a mother-in-law.
It'll serve her right, too.

766
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:32,688
Oh, no! Nobody should have
Mrs Hope for a mother-in-law.

767
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,688
Ah, there you are, young lady.

768
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:37,731
Just the one I want to see.
I've got a surprise for you.

769
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:42,368
As an unshelled nut is to a squirrel,
so is a surprise to him who receives it.

770
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:45,967
Righto, darling.
You're going to leave the ship at Singapore.

771
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,041
What?

772
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,566
Now, you run down below
and start to get ready.

773
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:52,120
Then when you come back,
I'll tell you the rest.

774
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:56,125
You oughta give Uncle Tommy a surprise too,
just to make him feel better.

775
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,841
- He's been in the... What was it?
- Doghouse.

776
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,968
With Mr Wu.

777
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:09,006
- What is all this?
- I just received this wireless from Shanghai.

778
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,641
- What will the consul do with her?
- There's a home for girls in Shanghai.

779
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:22,769
- He'll probably see she's placed in it.
- Home for girls?

780
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:27,209
You mean grey uniforms and pigtails?
Ching-Ching was never meant for that.

781
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:32,810
I know, old man, but I'm afraid
it's about all that can be done for her.

782
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,882
Captain, wait a minute.

783
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:39,209
This may sound crazy,
but why can't I adopt her?

784
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,602
Now, see here, son.
You're a bachelor. And quite a bachelor.

785
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,047
No court would turn a child over to you.

786
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:48,363
- It would be different if I were married?
- Well, naturally.

787
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:54,528
- It's a horrible step.
- I don't think you need worry, old man.

788
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,364
You haven't got time now.

789
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:09,325
- Excuse me. Have you seen Ching-Ching?
- Yes.

790
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:12,370
- Do you know where she is?
- Yes.

791
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,966
Well, would you mind telling me?

792
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,850
Below, getting ready
to leave the ship at the next stop.

793
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,082
They're putting her in a home for girls.

794
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:23,528
She'll be marching in lockstep
and eating gruel within a week.

795
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,967
- I hope you like it.
- Oh, Tommy.

796
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:29,601
- Tears won't help.
- But surely something can be done.

797
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:32,331
This can't happen to Ching-Ching.

798
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,402
I don't know.

799
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:39,525
Wait a minute.
You're gonna marry old sourpuss, aren't you?

800
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,921
- I beg your pardon?
- Sorry, no of fence meant.

801
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,049
Look, I tried to adopt Ching-Ching,
but I'm unmarried.

802
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:47,441
- You're getting married.
- Richard might...

803
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,002
- You don't want her to go to an institution?
- Of course not.

804
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:55,130
Then listen.
I've gone completely soft about that kid.

805
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,282
Incredible, I know, but true.

806
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:00,807
Adopt her. Let me pay for her upbringing
until I can take her myself.

807
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,282
That'll be as quick as I can get to the States
and come back with a wife.

808
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:07,364
Will you do it? It wouldn't be for long.

809
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:11,764
You may not believe it, but there are quite
a few girls back home willing to marry me.

810
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:13,683
At least there used to be.

811
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,366
It's not for me, it's for Ching-Ching.

812
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:19,489
- I'll do it.
- I knew you would.

813
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:22,282
May I speak to you, Susan?

814
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:25,045
- Pardon me.
- Certainly.

815
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:30,047
Susan, I'm awfully sorry if I annoyed you
in speaking of that bracelet as I did.

816
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:34,409
Imagine my becoming so upset
over a mere trinket. Absurd, isn't it?

817
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,881
Oh, I was a little upset myself. I'm sorry.

818
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,725
There, that's better. Everything's all right now.

819
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:45,125
Here we are, the three happy Hopes.
One, two, three, and away we go.

820
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,601
Mother was a little weepy
when you stalked out.

821
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:51,048
Somehow she got the idea
you'd prefer her not to live with us.

822
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:54,329
- Why, whatever could've given her that idea?
- I don't know.

823
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,882
But I told her we couldn't get along
without her. Didn't I, Mother?

824
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:01,646
- Well, I don't suppose we could.
- That's awfully sweet of you, Susan.

825
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:05,691
Heaven protect us all from interfering
mothers-in-law is what I always say.

826
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:09,560
Goodness. I was married myself once
and I know what I'm talking about.

827
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:15,363
Not that Mr Hope's mother didn't mean well,
but then, you know... young love.

828
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,442
We do know, don't we?

829
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,409
- Richard.
- Yes?

830
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,050
Just one thing.

831
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:27,602
Well, I want to adopt little Ching-Ching
as soon as we're married.

832
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,762
Whoever heard of such a thing?

833
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:32,207
If I don't, they'll put her in an institution.

834
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:35,523
- That's what institutions are for.
- Oh, Richard, please.

835
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:39,605
I'm sure Richard doesn't want to start
his married life with a ready-made family.

836
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,160
Especially with a child called Ching-Ching.

837
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,891
It won't be for long,
just until Mr Randall gets back.

838
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:49,568
- Randall? What's he got to do with it?
- Well... You see, it's a favour to him.

839
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,529
He wants to adopt her as soon as he can.

840
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:54,809
When he gets back to the States,
he'll arrange to take her.

841
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,963
- Why should I do Mr Randall a favour?
- Why indeed?

842
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:01,328
It isn't for him, it's for the little girl.
Think of her future.

843
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:04,210
Don't meddle
with other people's destinies, my dear.

844
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:08,330
Forget this child. She got along before she
met you and she will after she leaves you.

845
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,846
Dismiss her from your mind completely.

846
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:14,447
Please, don't you think Richard and I
should settle this by ourselves?

847
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,249
After all, it concerns us.

848
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:19,403
Anything that concerns Richard concerns me.

849
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,642
I think Mother's right, Susan.

850
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:23,210
- You do?
- Yes.

851
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:27,763
- Your mother's right and I'm wrong?
- Well, yes. That is, I think you're mistaken.

852
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:31,128
So do I. I've been mistaken about you and me.

853
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,885
- Now, Susan...
- Listen, marriage is for two people.

854
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:36,440
I'm breaking our engagement.

855
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:40,211
Richard, she'll come back.
Meanwhile you wait.

856
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:42,851
The man should always wait,
otherwise he's weak.

857
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:52,121
Ching-Ching! Ching-Ching!

858
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:57,170
Goodbye, Uncle Tommy.
The captain says I have to go.

859
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:58,765
No, you don't.

860
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:02,845
Didn't you say she could be adopted by
someone who's married? She's going to be.

861
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:05,321
- Here she is now.
- Oh, darling.

862
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:08,165
- Don't I have to go ashore?
- Not now. Tell her, Susan.

863
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:12,131
- Miss Parker's going to adopt Ching-Ching.
- I'm not going to be married.

864
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:17,286
- What? Oh, but you said...
- I think we'd better go now, darling.

865
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,687
Just a minute.

866
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:24,560
This isn't really goodbye.
I'll come back for you real soon.

867
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,530
And in the meantime, you won't cry, will you?

868
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:30,683
No, Uncle Tommy, but remember,

869
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:36,290
one... one minute of waiting
is a century to the hopeful.

870
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,806
I'll remember, Ching-Ching.

871
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,882
Goodbye, sweetie.

872
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:50,802
If you ever come back again, you won't
forget to come and see me, will you?

873
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,851
- I'll be in the orphan asylum in Shanghai.
- Oh, sure, we'll look you up.

874
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,400
- Won't we?
- Of course we will.

875
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,004
Maybe we'll have some more fun
like we had.

876
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:06,162
We might even go back to jail again.

877
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,322
<i>(Tommy)</i> Yes, we might.

878
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,847
Well, I think I'd better run along now.

879
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,400
Before I really cry. Goodbye.

880
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:24,964
We can't let this happen to her.

881
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:28,726
Look, Susan, I've got an idea.
Please don't say no till you hear me out.

882
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:32,691
I know exactly what you think of me,
but that isn't important now.

883
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:36,321
Marry me. Don't misunderstand me.
You wouldn't have to put up with me.

884
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,323
It'd just be a marriage in name only.

885
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,449
Soon as we dock in San Francisco,
go to Reno and get a divorce.

886
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:44,205
My lawyers will take care of everything.

887
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:48,524
I wish you would. For Ching-Ching.
It's the only way.

888
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:52,844
- You'd really do that for her?
- I'd do anything in the world for her.

889
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:55,321
- So would I.
- Then you will?

890
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,164
Yes.

891
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,527
Hey, bring her back.

892
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:04,127
- What's that?
- We're getting married. We want to adopt her.

893
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:09,524
Come on, Ching-Ching, darling.
We're going back aboard ship again.

894
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,886
For as much
as Susan Parker and Thomas Randall

895
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:15,088
have consented together in holy wedlock,

896
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,766
and have witnessed the same
before this company,

897
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:20,844
and have given and pledged
their troth, each to the other,

898
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:25,608
and have declared the same by giving
and receiving a ring and joining hands,

899
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:28,331
I pronounce that they are man and wife.

900
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,528
Amen.

901
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:33,729
- All happiness, my dear. Good luck, my boy.
- Thank you.

902
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:38,840
Twice blessed is he who loves both bride
and groom, for their happiness is his.

903
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:44,403
Congratulations, Mr Randall.
Much joy to you, Mrs Randall.

904
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:48,246
- Thank you.
- A sailor's knot is as good as City Hall's.

905
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:51,005
There'll be some formalities about the child.

906
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:53,321
I'll have my lawyer take care of that.

907
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:58,327
- Susan, why did you do this?
- Young man, you're talking to my wife.

908
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:02,011
- Richard, dear!
- And you told me to wait.

909
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:07,921
- Are you really and truly my parents now?
- We're the best you've got, darling.

910
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,688
Sun Lo says a child without parents
is like a ship without a rudder.

911
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:15,286
Sun Lo ever say anything
about going to sleep?

912
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,044
Oh, yes.

913
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:20,841
He said sleep without dreams
is given to children for their innocence

914
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:22,922
and old men for their wisdom.

915
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,606
Well, off you go, then.

916
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,604
I'm almost too excited to sleep, but I'll try.

917
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:32,765
- Good night, sweetie.
- Good night, Aunt Susan, Uncle Tommy.

918
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:35,684
Good night, darling,
but I'm not your uncle any more.

919
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:39,128
- What are you, then?
- Can't you guess?

920
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,771
I know. You're my father now.

921
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,650
- Night, Dad.
- Good night, honey.

922
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,607
- Good night.
- Good night.

923
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,882
Well, here you are.

924
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,928
Did the stewardess move your things?

925
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,731
She said Mrs Hope almost bit her.

926
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,211
- I...
- I...

927
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:10,282
- Go ahead.
- No, you.

928
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,807
Well, I was just going to say
if there was anything you wanted me to do

929
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:19,363
to lend credibility to the situation,
I'll be glad to do it, you know.

930
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:23,570
- People will talk whatever we do.
- Sure, of course.

931
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:26,120
Well, I guess I'll be off.

932
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:29,888
I don't know how to thank you.

933
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:32,770
I'll try to make things
as easy for you as possible.

934
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:37,084
I'm cabling my lawyers tonight. You can go
direct to Reno as soon as the boat docks.

935
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:39,766
- Everything's arranged.
- Very thoughtful.

936
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:42,810
Not at all. You'll like Reno.
It's a fascinating place.

937
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,326
Lots of fresh air and horseback riding.

938
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,448
Full of nice, emotional people.

939
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,010
Oh...

940
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:52,562
- This is the address you go to.
- Thank you.

941
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:58,370
You're really wonderful.
I suppose you know that.

942
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:02,684
Well, at the moment,
I don't feel very wonderful.

943
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:06,321
Well, if you must know,
I don't feel so good myself.

944
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:09,802
- Good night, Susan.
- Good night, Tommy.

945
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,361
I...

946
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:42,169
Begging your pardon, sir, where shall I
lay out your pyjamas this evening?

947
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:48,247
- Where you laid them last night.
- Oh, dear. I'm so sorry, sir.

948
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,684
<i>(knocking)</i>

949
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:04,251
Come in.

950
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:08,120
Susan, why didn't you warn me
you were going to do this?

951
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:12,444
Well, I... I didn't have time,
and besides... <i>(laughs)</i> it's too late now.

952
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:17,526
- Well, it's hardly funny, is it?
- Not to me.

953
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:21,446
Well, tell me one thing.
You don't love him, do you?

954
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,364
Do you?

955
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:28,449
No, I don't, but even if I did
it wouldn't make any difference.

956
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:32,605
Yes, it would. Listen, darling,
I've been a worm, I know that now.

957
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:35,286
But I've had an understanding with Mother.

958
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:40,207
You can have your way from now on, always,
if you'll tell me there's a chance.

959
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:43,602
Oh, no, Richard.
It wouldn't work. You know it wouldn't.

960
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:46,763
You can be nice. You're nice now, but...

961
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:50,367
- Please, Susan.
- No, really, I'm too confused to talk about it.

962
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:52,488
I'm even too upset to think about it.

963
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,769
I'll follow you.
I'll follow you until you say yes.

964
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,844
No, Richard, I'd rather you didn't.

965
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,242
You'd better lock this.

You stay in here
and I'll wait out in the courtroom.

984
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,129
- Is this Mrs Randall?
- Yes.

985
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,567
You mustn't be nervous
when your case is called.

986
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:13,486
I've placed you at the beginning
of today's calendar. Meanwhile, wait here.

987
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:15,369
That's awfully kind of you, Judge.

988
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:18,808
This is my first divorce,
and I'm a little jittery.

989
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:21,963
It is a little strange at first,
but they all get used to it.

990
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,805
- You know, like influenza.
- <i>(knocking)</i>

991
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,008
Come.

992
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,082
Right in here, please.

993
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:35,924
- Susan!
- Darling, I'm so glad to see you.

994
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,767
Oh, this is a surprise.
But I don't understand.

995
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:44,162
Well, you see, I thought
I might want another divorce sometime.

996
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:47,687
I was sort of curious
to see how they made them.

997
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:49,125
<i>(clears throat)</i>

998
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:52,727
- Judge Booth, this is Mr Randall.
- The husband, I presume?

999
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,041
Yes. This is my daughter.

1000
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,566
- <i>Your</i> daughter?
- Adopted.

1001
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:00,530
- How are you, young lady?
- Fine, thank you.

1002
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:04,082
To greet one you love
is better for the health than medicine.

1003
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:07,687
Well, I declare.
That sounds like a Chinese proverb.

1004
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,842
Judge, you haven't heard anything yet.

1005
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:13,720
Well, well, well.
Come over here and talk to me.

1006
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:22,687
I... I tried to stay away, but I found I couldn't.
I had to see you again.

1007
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:26,410
Suppose you and I have our talk
in the other room.

1008
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:30,526
Uh...

1009
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:34,571
- Will you excuse us for a few moments?
- Oh, but would it be proper?

1010
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:40,522
- I mean, our being left alone together now.
- Oh, it's quite customary.

1011
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:48,961
- You're looking very well.
- I haven't had a drink in six weeks.

1012
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:52,283
- That's wonderful.
- No, it isn't, it's terrible.

1013
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:56,763
Still, I'll get along, and it does show
what the influence of a good woman can do.

1014
01:15:56,840 --> 01:16:00,128
- Oh, really? Who is she?
- Ching-Ching.

1015
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:05,241
I told you I'd do anything in the world for her.

1016
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:07,607
You've proven that.

1017
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:11,526
Honestly, you wouldn't know me.
I'm a changed man.

1018
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,285
I may not be any better,
but at least I'm different.

1019
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:16,203
I'm so glad.

1020
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:25,766
You know, you were right about Reno.
It's a fascinating place.

1021
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,286
- So charming and...
- Susan. Darling.

1022
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:31,250
- Oh, Tommy, please.
- Do we have to go through with this?

1023
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:38,090
Richard is waiting in the courtroom to marry
me. He's gonna take me back to the Orient.

1024
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,162
Oh...

1025
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:43,242
I see.

1026
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,922
Well, I guess that's that, isn't it?

1027
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,207
I'm sorry.

1028
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,282
Sorrier than I can say.

1029
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:10,243
Everyone rise.
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye!

1030
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:13,961
The District Court of Washoe,
State of Nevada, is now in session.

1031
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:18,602
The Honourable JG Booth, judge presiding.
Be seated, please.

1032
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:22,445
Case of Randall versus Randall.

1033
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:25,603
- Any witnesses for plaintiff?
- The case is uncontested.

1034
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:28,684
In that case, the court would like
to call a witness of its own.

1035
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:30,603
But the case is uncontested.

1036
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:36,050
I said the court will call a witness of its own.
Miss Barbara Randall.

1037
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,803
We don't want her mixed up in this.

1038
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,771
The witness will take the stand.
The defendant will please be seated.

1039
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:53,483
- Raise your right hand, please.
- I think we can dispense with the oath.

1040
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:57,645
- Yes, Your Honour.
- Now, Miss Randall.

1041
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:00,644
- You can call me Ching-Ching, Judge.
- Thank you.

1042
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:04,930
Now, Ching-Ching, the plaintiff
alleges general incompatibility.

1043
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,571
Have you ever noticed
evidence of such a condition

1044
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:10,883
existing between the parties to this action?

1045
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,361
To my knowledge,
the contestants in this action

1046
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,250
have manifested
nothing but the most harmonious,

1047
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:19,324
cordial and friendly feelings
towards each other.

1048
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:30,483
- But, Your Honour, I object.
- Who are you, young man?

1049
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:34,963
- Why, I'm engaged to the plaintiff.
- Engaged?

1050
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,122
To a married woman?

1051
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:40,727
- This court recognises no such engagement.
- <i>(laughter)</i>

1052
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:45,966
Now, Ching-Ching, have either of the parties
in this action ever evidenced by their conduct

1053
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:48,691
any proper legal ground for divorce?

1054
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:53,527
There's utterly no ground for disturbing
the marital status of the contestants.

1055
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:57,366
Most irregular, Your Honour.
The child doesn't know what she is saying.

1056
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:00,250
Oh, yes, she does.
Tell the court.

1057
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:04,291
Isn't this action the result of two
grown-up people behaving like children,

1058
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:07,250
refusing to admit
that they're in love with each other?

1059
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:13,043
The allegations of the complaint
insofar as it refers to...

1060
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,691
Uh...

1061
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:17,603
Matrimony.

1062
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:18,966
Huh?

1063
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,529
- Matrimony.
- Oh, yes.

1064
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:27,286
- Insofar as it refers to macaroni...
- <i>(lawyer)</i> Macaroni?

1065
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:31,684
There! See, Your Honour?
The child has obviously been coached.

1066
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:35,481
I was not. I just forgot
what the judge told me to say.

1067
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:37,244
<i>- (laughter)
- (gavel)</i>

1068
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:41,120
- ls counsel intimating that she is lying?
- Counsel charges just that.

1069
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:44,568
Have you any witnesses
to disprove her testimony?

1070
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:47,723
Do you wish to testify
that this child was lying?

1071
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:50,007
Why...

1072
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:54,802
- No, of course not.
- Then you admit that you love Mrs Randall?

1073
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,291
She knows I do.

1074
01:19:56,360 --> 01:20:00,001
You, Mrs Randall.
Do you wish to attack this child's veracity?

1075
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:03,562
- Why, no, certainly not.
- You admit that you love your husband?

1076
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:10,448
- Well, yes, I do.
- Then what's all this nonsense about?

1077
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:15,731
Divorce denied. Take your child
and go home, both of you, where you belong.

1078
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,689
Your Honour, what about me?

1079
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:23,889
My advice, young man, is to stop tampering
with the affections of married women.

1080
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:38,564
- Well, we did it, didn't we?
- You bet we did.

1081
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:41,285
Judge, you're simply stravagant.
