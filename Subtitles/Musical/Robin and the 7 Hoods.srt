My old man gets free soup every day...

1170
01:26:41,405 --> 01:26:43,449

What's the matter? You can't see
what he's doing in your heads?

1174
01:26:56,462 --> 01:26:58,422
I gotta explain that to you.

1175
01:26:58,631 --> 01:27:03,010
This man's organizing himself the
biggest bodyguard there ever was:

The people of Chicago.

1177
01:27:05,012 --> 01:27:09,183
He's in so thick with them, you
can't touch him with a flagpole.

1178
01:27:09,391 --> 01:27:12,228
Now once and for all,
this man's gotta go.

1179
01:27:12,686 --> 01:27:15,856
We can't have any violence,
I warn you.

1180
01:27:16,065 --> 01:27:19,151
Forget the warnings. Just sit down.

1181
01:27:19,735 --> 01:27:24,657

a cornerstone for a synagogue.

- No.
- Even if we get Robbo to convert?

1183
01:27:28,327 --> 01:27:30,579
Disappearing is the same as hitting.

between you and the defendant
after Big Jim's murder.

1199
01:28:37,271 --> 01:28:40,566
<i>I'll</i> tell you that story now.

1200
01:28:40,774 --> 01:28:44,403
I was in the hotel
with some friends...

1201
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:48,157
we meet to play mahjong.

1202
01:28:48,365 --> 01:28:52,786
It's 12:30, Robbo comes in.
He don't knock, nothing.

1203
01:28:52,995 --> 01:28:56,874
He barges right in,
and he declares himself.

1204
01:28:57,082 --> 01:29:02,129
He says this, <i>I'll</i> never forget it,
now that Big Jim...

1205
01:29:02,338 --> 01:29:04,006
has gone to meet his maker...

1206
01:29:04,214 --> 01:29:09,094
he's decided... He means
that the man was dead.

1207
01:29:09,303 --> 01:29:11,513
I want you to understand.

1208
01:29:11,722 --> 01:29:13,640
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1209
01:29:13,849 --> 01:29:17,644
Now he says Big Jim is dead,
he's the new boss...

1210
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:22,858
and everybody has to pay him
a 50-percent service charge...

1211
01:29:23,067 --> 01:29:24,943
that's for protection.

1212
01:29:25,694 --> 01:29:28,113
Tell me, Mr. Gisborne...

1213
01:29:28,322 --> 01:29:31,450
what was your reaction?

1214
01:29:32,576 --> 01:29:36,872
Stunned. I was stunned.
In other words, I couldn't talk.

1215
01:29:37,081 --> 01:29:41,293
Finally, I regained my composure,
and I said to him:

1216
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:45,297
"Robbo. Why do we need
a new boss for?

1217
01:29:45,506 --> 01:29:48,842
We've got an honest man,
Sheriff Glick."

1218
01:29:49,635 --> 01:29:51,845
What did he say to that?

1219
01:29:52,012 --> 01:29:53,722
You want the exact words?

1220
01:29:53,931 --> 01:29:55,641
The exact words.

1221
01:29:55,808 --> 01:30:01,063
Here's what he said.
"Don't worry about Sheriff Glick...

1222
01:30:01,271 --> 01:30:04,316
because I'm going
to fix his wagon."

1223
01:30:04,483 --> 01:30:07,277
Next thing I know,
the wagon is fixed.

1224
01:30:07,444 --> 01:30:11,865
Hmm. Did Robbo say
how he planned to...

1225
01:30:12,074 --> 01:30:14,660
fix the sheriff's wagon?

1226
01:30:14,868 --> 01:30:18,163
He did not. But <i>I'll</i> tell you this.

1227
01:30:18,372 --> 01:30:22,167
When he fixes a wagon,
it's an interesting ride.

1228
01:30:22,376 --> 01:30:25,712
I object. This comes
from a witness...

1229
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:29,633
who is a convicted murderer
and racketeer.

1230
01:30:29,842 --> 01:30:31,218
He is under oath...

1231
01:30:31,427 --> 01:30:34,763
he knows the consequences
for lying.

1232
01:30:34,972 --> 01:30:39,226
- Absolutely.
- Objection overruled.

1233
01:30:39,435 --> 01:30:41,353
Thank you. He's nice.

1234
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,857

1236
01:30:50,279 --> 01:30:54,783
were there meetings
between Robbo and the sheriff...

1237
01:30:54,992 --> 01:30:58,871
prior to the murder.
- One, in particular.

1238
01:30:59,079 --> 01:31:02,958
Robbo said something
would happen to Big Jim...

1239
01:31:03,167 --> 01:31:07,754
and asked the sheriff
if he wanted protection.

1240
01:31:07,963 --> 01:31:10,466
The sheriff threw him out.

1241
01:31:10,674 --> 01:31:14,052
I see. Did Robbo contact him
after this?

1242
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:19,433
He threatened him.
The sheriff was in fear of his life.

1243
01:31:19,975 --> 01:31:24,271
In other words, the sheriff
could not be bribed.

1244
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:27,524
