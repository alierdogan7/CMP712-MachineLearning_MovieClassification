1
00:00:48,314 --> 00:01:03,029
Gurukant Desai
salutes the family.

2
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:04,189
"Don't dream."

3
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:25,085
"Dreams never come true."

4
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,746
My father would say.

5
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:33,625
But I dreamt.

6
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,056
I'll work in Turkey
like Ghanshyam Das

7
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:11,297
Ghanshyam took him to town for
an interview - he got the job

8
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,696
I got my passport too.

9
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:15,502
Why's this happening behind my back?

10
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:19,072
The school results are
out tomorrow, right?

11
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:23,076
You checked the results in town?

12
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,475
You've failed?

13
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:34,087
Trying to cover
the shame with a job?

14
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:38,625
I've a job. How does a
pass or fail matter?

15
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,060
I'll skin you The whole
village will laugh that..

16
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,564
..the math teacher's son is
a fool. You'll never prosper.

17
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:47,667
Don't curse. He's going away.

18
00:02:47,667 --> 00:03:04,250
     Go to hell
I can't bear my son failing.

19
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,554
My step son is going abroad

20
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:12,759
Fall at my feet, you foolish monkey

21
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:32,078
Look step-mother I've
come from Idhar to Istanbul.

22
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,646
You run away too and come here

23
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:36,783
But you'll be scared when
you see these huge buildings.

24
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:44,424
I'm not scared. Know why? There's
no school, no father, nor his cane

25
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:53,600
I'm so glad to see you come.

26
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,105
I wear a uniform. Its Red. And
a cap too. I look good in it.

27
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,641
I work very hard.
I sell petrol cans.

28
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,689
You're amazing.

29
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,701
Come, this is not for us.

30
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,608
Your luck is incredible.

31
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,325
I'll open it...

32
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:22,588
You shut his shop. How did you know
the red ball was under that glass?

33
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:35,468
I just kept my eyes on that.

34
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:38,438
This is the spice business
Very big traders come here.

35
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,239
It's a business for the clever.

36
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:43,609
The sharper you are,
the luckier you are

37
00:05:43,609 --> 00:06:00,029
From tomorrow there will be a new
trader amongst them - Gurukant Desai

38
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,197
Where's your tie? Take it out.

39
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,221
This?

40
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:07,390
- Wear it.

41
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,071
There have been sorme
complaints against you

42
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:36,162
You're lucky. He has
made you a sales supervisor.

43
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:39,065
It took me thirteen years to
become a sales supervisor.

44
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,625
...just keep that tie on.

45
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:49,241
I don't want to wear a tie
Nor do I want this promotion

46
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:50,367
Why?

47
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:56,382
I want to return to my village.

48
00:11:56,382 --> 00:12:01,320
When did this foolish idea
occur to you, may I ask?

49
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,514
After wearing the tie.

50
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:05,047
Why?

51
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:12,031
You like my work, so
does he, then why should..

52
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:18,537
..I work for that white man?
I'll work for myself.

53
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:22,141
Take it in writing,
you'll never succeed.

54
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:30,626
My destiny is already written.

55
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:46,632
I'll always remember you

56
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:53,038
You're taking all the fun with you.

57
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:59,527
Now we'll just slog here.

58
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,324
Baapu, I'm leaving.

59
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:43,068
The country's become free
so why not your daughter?

60
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:47,439
I've found my partner
Please wish for my happiness

61
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:48,565
Sujata.

62
00:17:53,072 --> 00:18:00,152
A bearded man left
this letter for you.

63
00:18:07,056 --> 00:18:12,092
I don't have the courage to run
and lead a life with you.

64
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:15,656
Please forgive me, Sujata
Yours, Bhanu Patel.

65
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,082
You're spread like a
python on the whole berth.

66
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,572
I have a reservation.

67
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:36,041
Look out it's still night.

68
00:19:40,045 --> 00:20:25,691
Can't think beyond the village

69
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:32,064
Throw it when the train
stops. It won't fly back

70
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:37,642
Oh god, I can't even cry in peace

71
00:20:43,642 --> 00:21:09,234
Good, you woke me
My station's come

72
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:12,204
Girl Alone? Boarded
at the last Station?

73
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,262
Yes.

74
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:45,270
Where did you go and die,
all these days stepson?

75
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:51,109
I was saving myself from
your beatings, you witch

76
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:53,378
Guru has become an Englishman!

77
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:54,436
Come.

78
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:56,378
Sit. Sit.

79
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,054
Come Ramlal, look who's come

80
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,289
Guru? I didn 't recognize you

81
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,725
How would you?
- You can't see after your marriage

82
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:15,400
Has your wife come? Guru
give him some money... 

83
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:26,611
Miser. Give him twenty.

84
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:44,062
Must have received ten
twenty lakh canings

85
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,064
And look at the
progress you've made!

86
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:48,100
If I'd known earlier, I would have hit
you until you became Prime Minister.

87
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,500
For me?

88
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,344
Wonderful!

89
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,519
How many days have you taken off?

90
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:10,055
As many as I want.
- What do you mean?

91
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:14,326
Meaning, I've left the job

92
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:18,184
But your brother said that they've promoted
you and tripled your salary.

93
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:25,203
Yes.. - but I've worked
enough for the white man...

94
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:29,139
I want to do business.

95
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:37,082
What do you know about business?
When I did business..

96
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,617
I could hardly put
food on the thable

97
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:48,360
Just because you failed,
doesn't mean I won't pass

98
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,330
Keep it. It'II help you
keep track of the bad time

99
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:55,766
Return his money.

100
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:07,573
Go do business.

101
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,085
Carrying huge tins, bhajiya in one

102
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:49,610
...Kachori in the other!

103
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:53,625
Bastard, you 've been selling
something or the other since childhood

104
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:57,062
Three paise profit for one bhajia

105
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,664
and the
bhajiya's weren't even hot

106
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,032
After climbing all
these stairs we should

107
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:07,305
at least make
half a paise profit

108
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:08,670
Bhajia!

109
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,537
Kachori!

110
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,277
King of misers!

111
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:27,592
I've fifteen thousand
I need another fifteen

112
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:33,031
He won't invest. He's saved
it for my sister's wedding

113
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,999
Dowry?
- Yes.

114
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:36,192
How much?

115
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,263
Twenty five thousand.

116
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:42,732
I'll marry her.

117
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,235
What?

118
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:48,510
Marry her to me.

119
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:55,587
She is elder to us by a year

120
00:25:55,587 --> 00:26:00,025
One, two years is no big deal.

121
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,994
Don't talk without thinking.

122
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:04,552
Look, all I know is that

123
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:05,961
I'm ready to marry her.

124
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:07,365
Then we'll be business partners

125
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:08,491
Fifty-fifty.

126
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:16,041
You will receive a dowry
and make me an equal partner?

127
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:23,048
You'll also be part of the dowry

128
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,606
How do I tell bapu?

129
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,518
I won't be able to.

130
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:31,366
I'm marrying, not stealing
I'll talk to him

131
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:19,771
Have you come to talk about
marriage? Are you a broker?

132
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,170
We aren't interested.

133
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:27,045
The last time I saw you you
were crying yourself hoarse

134
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:31,583
I don't even know you. Why
would I cry in front of you?

135
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,051
You were crying in front of
the whole world on the train..

136
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:35,387
..reading some Bhapu Patel's letter

137
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:36,581
Who are you?

138
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:40,025
Guru, who knows everything.

139
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:45,397
My leg broke, it still hurts

140
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:48,066
Then go to a doctor
What are you here for?

141
00:27:56,341 --> 00:28:00,017
Don't drag me into this

142
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,279
Where is Kaka?

143
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,051
Do you recognize me?

144
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,292
No.

145
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:34,446
You shut down my father's ghee shop
you even took away all the buffaloes

146
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:36,047
You're the boy who
hit me on my ear

147
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:39,384
...with a stick and ran away.

148
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,477
I was eight years old.

149
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:49,427
You've come to make me
deaf in my other ear?

150
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:54,065
    Kantilal
He has no business sense

151
00:28:54,065 --> 00:29:02,207
Headmaster? You are in Turkey, right?

152
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:07,112
No, I'm here I want to do
business here with your son Jignesh

153
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:08,306
What business?

154
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:12,150
Many new things are available there.

155
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:18,022
I'II bring then and sell then
here I'll make good profit

156
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:21,459
And what does your father say?

157
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:22,949
He says I'll be ruined.

158
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:32,036
I've got to get my daughter married

159
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:39,544
I'll marry her and
take good care of her

160
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:48,113
My daughter is crazy.

161
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:54,025
Haven't you heard what those
bastard villagers are saying?

162
00:29:54,025 --> 00:30:02,667
Jobless people keep
wagging their tongues.

163
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:10,708
There was a sickly looking youngster,
with a red flag and four labourers

164
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:23,354
She wanted to marry him have you heard
this at least or are you deaf too?

165
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:27,625
I was on the same
train as her that night

166
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:37,101
I know right from wrong

167
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:50,248
Just give me your blessing
and I'll take care of the girl

168
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:51,374
I'll take your leave.

169
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:01,386
Where did your wife go?

170
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:01,386
Don't scream she is not coming.

171
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:04,719
Why not?
- Let it be.

172
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:08,026
What catastrophe
is keeping her here?

173
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:11,029
Don't know. Maybe
she doesn't like me

174
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:15,066
How can she not like you?
The witch is mad.

175
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:19,404
Not all women are sweet like you

176
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:22,202
Come on, bless me.

177
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:49,067
I know it's not your wish
but can't you bless me?

178
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:55,018
May God give you sense

179
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,076
Don't go.

180
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:44,145
What?

181
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:52,530
What if I die here all alone?

182
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:56,167
But you said you
didn't want to come

183
00:33:56,167 --> 00:34:02,040
You could have asked me again

184
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:11,549
Look, you are not asking me even now.

185
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:16,054
But you don't even have any luggage?

186
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:20,124
Can't you buy me four saris?

187
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:21,386
And ticket?

188
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:26,431
Do I need a ticket
to sit on your lap?

189
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:29,628
Come.

190
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:48,546
Where is the Yarn market?
- This way

191
00:35:48,546 --> 00:36:01,559
Where does all the buying and
selling happen? -Upstairs sir

192
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:11,102
Why do they shout so much?
How will we do business here?

193
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,370
Mathura Das?

194
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,042
Could be. Why?

195
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:32,390
I've come from Idhar
village in Gujarat

196
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,724
I want to do yarn
business with my own money

197
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:36,318
Wherever I go, people say there
is a union.

198
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:42,500
Yes.
You have to be a member.

199
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,737
Your bid's too high. You'll
get it much cheaper in Salem.

200
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:50,708
Quiet! Don't teach me business. If
you want to trade, become a member

201
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,005
So make me a member.

202
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:55,413
There's a five year waiting
period. Don't waste your time

203
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:59,550
You're not letting me do business
nor are you making me a member

204
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:06,157
Don't chew my head. Arzaan Contractor
is the president of the union

205
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:13,264
You can become a member only with
his letter. You won't become a member.

206
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:16,033
Are you a fortune teller?

207
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:23,172
Twenty five thousand like you come here
everyday. You'll never make it go away.

208
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:34,318
I'll stand right next
to you and do business.

209
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:55,063
What do you want?

210
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:03,414
Your letter. I want to
trade in the cloth market.

211
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:04,472
Come to the office.

212
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:06,948
I have. For four months.

213
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:13,291
I know Bhola's entire
family history.. your watchman

214
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,485
Do you play golf?

215
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,495
I play, but not this.

216
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:22,465
Play.

217
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:32,576
If this ball goes into that
hole you'll get your letter.

218
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:34,045
I've to put this ball in that hole..

219
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,379
..and you will give me the letter?

220
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:37,506
Of course.

221
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,721
For sure, right, if I do it?

222
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:45,052
Try it.

223
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,329
What's your name?
- Gurukant Desai

224
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:01,005
You'll give me the letter?

225
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,233
Ok. I'll see.

226
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:06,143
I've collected money for
business with great difficulty.

227
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:07,440
I'll take care.

228
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:12,016
In my village, help
is never forgotten

229
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:15,086
It'll happen. If
you don't mind. Yeah?

230
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,434
Let me get the change!
What's the hurry?

231
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:31,662
I've got something.

232
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,264
For me?
- Yes.

233
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:35,100
What?

234
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:40,151
What have bought for me?

235
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:48,345
This?

236
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,248
Don't you like it?

237
00:39:52,323 --> 00:40:00,064
I thought you'll get me lots of saris,
jewelery, diamonds, 8-10 big cars

238
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,292
I will bring it all.

239
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,059
You'll see.

240
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,499
Can you see?

241
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:23,354
I can see.. it a
big house.. a palace

242
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:32,530
I can see brinjals
totally burnt. No food tonight

243
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:42,106
I see clothes in the wash.. wet

244
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:48,112
...you'll have to go in
your underwear tomorrow.

245
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:57,117
I can see you, fat, nau lakha necklace, 
fat bangles..walking with a swagger..

246
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:01,119
..all five five hundred pounds of you
-I'll never be fat.

247
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:06,030
Ok slim one! Wearing
nau lakha necklace..

248
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:09,066
..fat bangles..
walking with a swagger.

249
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:10,124
Happy.

250
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:14,333
Very very very happy.

251
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:17,433
With you.

252
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:26,016
The brother-in-law is here

253
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,541
It's all over.

254
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:32,156
What?
Our business

255
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,646
But what happened?

256
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:40,364
Contractor's
rejected our application

257
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:42,099
Can't be. He gave me his word

258
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:47,338
I'm coming from his office
He tore up our application

259
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,574
So do we go back th the village now?

260
00:41:50,574 --> 00:42:18,669
If we don't, we'll
be out on the streets

261
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:20,728
Who are you?

262
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,536
Who are you?

263
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:24,065
I live here.

264
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:26,337
I don't live here, okay?

265
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:30,080
Then why are you
staring at my building?

266
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:35,352
Why? Do I need a
letter even to look now?

267
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:37,087
The building is on the road,
the road is the Government's

268
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:38,789
these eyes are mine
the country is free

269
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:43,060
I can stare at whoever,
whenever I want. Don't bug me.

270
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,663
Go watch your dog piss

271
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:55,096
What's your name?

272
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:59,109
You've turned your
city into a dump

273
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:02,546
you've to wear a
suit and talk in English

274
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:12,122
Good. Being angry with
Bombay is very good

275
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:21,665
I am angry with one man
I want to slap him..

276
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:24,068
..Arzan Contractor..

277
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:28,072
..Four months ago and
then tore up my application

278
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:32,076
He doesn't wake up before ten
o'clock, how will you slap him?

279
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:33,373
Do you know him?

280
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,036
Since he was this little.

281
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:38,082
Can you do something for me?

282
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:41,085
I don't believe in giving
or taking recommendations

283
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:45,456
But you look like a big
social communist leader.

284
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:49,059
You should help the poor

285
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:50,458
And if I say no?

286
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:58,569
That's a problem I
can't hear the word 'no'

287
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:02,573
Come to my office tomorrow

288
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:05,309
Will you get the letter for me?

289
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,111
I'll make sure your voice is heard

290
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:09,136
How?

291
00:44:10,385 --> 00:44:15,977
I will fight your war...

292
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:18,589
..but if you've lied I'll slap you

293
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:24,094
I've just arrived in Bombay,
I haven't learnt to lie yet

294
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:26,221
Good, come tomorrow.

295
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:38,075
Trading's big shot, Arzan Contractor..
The country is free but..

296
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:49,086
Mr Contractor considers himself
the undisputed lord of the union..

297
00:44:55,759 --> 00:45:01,031
now nobody can stop Guru
from becoming a businessman

298
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,166
A very big businessman

299
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:07,971
Bigger than anybody...
am I talking too big?

300
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:10,371
A bit.

301
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:22,586
Here I am, right beside you

302
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:33,030
But you won't last - There
are a dime a dozen like you..

303
00:45:33,030 --> 00:46:00,991

304
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:04,561
I didn't know you had so
many complaints against oe.

305
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:11,034
You should have talked to me,
not the papers

306
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:14,037
It' s difficult to meet you

307
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:16,039
Today you're in
trouble so you've come here...

308
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:20,043
or you go only to the club

309
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:27,710
I am resigning.

310
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:32,316
No.

311
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:34,324
Let him go, someone
else will come along

312
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:37,628
Quiet. You needn't go sir

313
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,392
He's decided.

314
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:46,069
Now even God can't make him
change his decision, isn't it?

315
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:50,073
My decision won't
change but times will

316
00:46:50,073 --> 00:47:00,284
Anything could happen tomorrow,
don't come crying to me

317
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:04,021
If we're going to be that scared,
how'll we do business?

318
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:10,994
Don't worry we are the fearless

319
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,563
What was your name again?

320
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:37,054
Not 'was', it still is
and will always be Gurukant Desai

321
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:45,429
Where is that villager Guru?

322
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:51,068
Meenu, what do we do with him

323
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:55,472
You can become a member only with
his letter. You won't become a member

324
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:56,734
I'll do it.

325
00:47:56,807 --> 00:47:58,399
Which tooth?

326
00:47:59,009 --> 00:47:59,998
This one.

327
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:02,145
My name is Meenakshi

328
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:06,650
Jalkukdi.. Meenu. No.
-Yes.  -No.

329
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:09,086
She won't accept defeat

330
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:15,993
It's too small a place for you...

331
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:19,162
That he doesn't have faith in
himself and has to depend on God

332
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:20,561
He was right.

333
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:25,168
No, God and I don't get along

334
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:31,308
You'll get both or neither

335
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:33,105
She's smarter than you.

336
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:37,047
Why don't you treat the
prasad as a sweet and...

337
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:39,116
I'll treat the tilak as just colour

338
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:43,053
You've to have your way

339
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:46,590
Such a struggle for a fine sweet!

340
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,285
Who is this villager?

341
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:50,394
My brother-in-law and partner

342
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:51,520
What business?

343
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,187
Cotton.
- Polyester.

344
00:48:55,065 --> 00:49:01,021
Very good.. a fight
on the very first day

345
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:20,557
My brother is sleeping outside

346
00:49:20,557 --> 00:49:23,580
I am not asking you to wake him.

347
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:19,082
What will you do now?

348
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:20,276
What do you think?

349
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:25,088
You beast... you brought us
here like a big leader..

350
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:26,680
..how are you going to

351
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:28,554
clothe and feed us?

352
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,121
Polyester.

353
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:35,189
What's that?

354
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:48,345
Soft, shiny, naughty.. just like you

355
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:52,716
I made a big mistake marrying you.

356
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,117
I can't understand whether you..

357
00:50:54,117 --> 00:51:00,057
..love your me or your yarn more

358
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,024
Should I tell you?

359
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:09,132
Das was saying the polyester
business is dangerous. - Let him

360
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:13,070
Are you brainless? The whole
world is into cotton and you

361
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,072
When you see the profit

362
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:18,075
you'll say wow Guru,
how intelligent you are!

363
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,276
How much did you invest?

364
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:20,402
All the money.

365
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:22,206
Oh God, you'll kill us.

366
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:27,559
We'll think about
that when we get killed

367
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:41,031
They say it's gambling

368
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:43,363
Gambling?

369
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:46,103
But the fun of business is
predicting which price will rise...

370
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:49,106
and fall.. where the
losses and profits are..

371
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,550
...that shows the
acumen of the businessman.

372
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:53,110
The Government calls that gambling

373
00:51:57,114 --> 00:52:00,450
Mahalaxmi, horse races and
astrology. All that's gambling too

374
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,453
You came and ruined everyone

375
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:04,647
Not me.

376
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:10,390
No problem.

377
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:14,264
Let's do our businesses from here

378
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:18,535
send everybody else in as well

379
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:26,143
This is a Government
notice from an I.A.S. Officer...

380
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,735
It's the law now.

381
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,079
If a law can be made in a day..

382
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:31,414
..then it can also
be changed in a day

383
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:56,436
Come... this way.

384
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:59,769
Mr. K.R. Menon?

385
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,037
Who are you?

386
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:04,381
So you stopped the trading?
- What are these?

387
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:13,523
Uniforms, ask him to stop.
- Come in

388
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,718
Stop.

389
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:18,984
All the goods are yours.

390
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,064
What nonsense. Who are you?

391
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:23,066
My father-in-law is a moneylender

392
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:26,068
..people who borrowed money from him and
failed to pay up, had theirs taken.

393
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:30,407
If a ghee shop was shut down
then he would keep the buffaloes..

394
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:32,075
I had a polyester shop and..

395
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:36,613
you shut it down so
now all this is yours

396
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:47,129
Top quality polyester
Make clothes for the children

397
00:53:53,129 --> 00:53:54,426
Gurukant Desai.

398
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:07,032
Menon sir, Good day.

399
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:10,513
I've been looking
for you for four days.

400
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:18,054
Mr Menon, A very
big I.A.S officer

401
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:21,024
Look, my record is impeccable..

402
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:23,026
..if the higher
authorities find out about the..

403
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:25,795
polyester, I will lose my job

404
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:27,464
What can I do about that air?

405
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:30,800
Take it all back,
neighbours have begun to talk

406
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,604
But until the market opens I
can't take the goods back

407
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,273
Are you threatening me?

408
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:38,074
No sir, but the other traders were..

409
00:54:38,074 --> 00:54:40,443
..also going to come to your
house to leave their goods..

410
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:44,547
How can I re-open the market?

411
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:48,084
I'm an illiterate villager,
I don't know much, but if you closed the market..

412
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:51,388
..then you must have the keys

413
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,185
And if I say no?

414
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:54,314
What?

415
00:54:54,357 --> 00:54:56,416
And if I say no?

416
00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:01,031
I don't understand the word 'no'

417
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:38,596
Good show.

418
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:52,716
Guruji has come. He has
brought gifts for all

419
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:05,995
You forgot the jalkukdi?

420
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:07,087
Close your eyes.

421
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:24,575
Now open them.

422
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:28,040
A wedding sari!

423
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:29,585
You'll marry me?

424
00:56:29,652 --> 00:56:30,983
For seven lifetimes...

425
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:34,581
Very nice.

426
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:37,015
I'll show it to everyone.

427
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:40,221
So Gurubhai?

428
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:43,726
I'm like your son.

429
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:47,332
The name suits you.

430
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:54,366
Come on, get up.

431
00:56:58,348 --> 00:56:59,508
I know you're not even

432
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:00,947
going to touch this...

433
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:05,088
you look like
Gandhiji in this dhoti

434
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:08,992
But when you travel abroad...

435
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:12,996
and it's very cold you can make
a coat like Nehru's and wear it

436
00:57:12,996 --> 00:57:15,624
...it'll look very nice.

437
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:22,038
Are you bribing me throwing
Gandhiji and Nehru's names in?

438
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:32,048
No. I don't know how to shake
hands and say thank you in English

439
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:33,982
If you don't like it...

440
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:36,453
then break both my
neck and teeth, Okay?

441
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:40,023
This is what I like about you..

442
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:45,295
..suddenly you speak with
honesty and intelligence

443
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:48,998
Don't ever let go of this habit

444
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:51,343
Whatever happens, I'II
never let it go. I promise

445
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:11,006
Finish it in one gulp.

446
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:18,488
He won't drink, his
wife will scream at him

447
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:26,262
All wives scold.. if you
drink a bit, you'll hear less

448
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:29,198
I apologize for being late

449
00:59:29,198 --> 00:59:33,036
I was doing our trial balance...

450
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:39,175
..our profits are up
by 300% in six months

451
00:59:39,175 --> 00:59:43,513
And the price of polyester
has gone through the roof!

452
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:48,051
But don't relax, because if
we've worked 18 hours till today

453
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:52,121
we will now work 25 hours per day

454
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:54,521
Ask why?

455
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:59,028
Because the Shakti
family will not only trade...

456
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:04,601
..we will make kela silk.
We are opening a factory

457
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,069
Foreign machines will produce the..

458
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:11,074
..English named
kela silk.. polyester.

459
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:13,076
Just because you 've
bought a ram doesn't mean..

460
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:14,544
..that you dream of
opening a factory

461
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:24,621
We've also seen the land 25
acres right next to your village

462
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:28,558
Walk carefully, don't
be in such a hurry

463
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:34,030
I'm carrying you in my
arms, so don't fall

464
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:35,224
And the money?

465
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:38,534
Are you Contractor, that the
banks will give you a loan?

466
01:00:41,104 --> 01:00:44,107
..we will go to the public..
give ten rupees..

467
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:48,111
..and become the owner..
public issue..

468
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:53,416
..if the factory earns,
so will everyone.

469
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:55,718
Permission for the public
issue will come in one month

470
01:00:55,718 --> 01:01:01,024
Fantastic! Let's have
another one on this!

471
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:04,983
You didn't ask me...

472
01:01:05,028 --> 01:01:12,535
..you could've at
least taken my opinion

473
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:20,076
You wouldn't have let us sell
polyester, or anything else

474
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:23,079
You were about to pack up
and go back to the village

475
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:25,013
We are partners...

476
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:27,140
...it's not just you.

477
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:35,425
You just stay behind me
and watch the world.

478
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:40,096
If you stick your nose in,
I'll turn you into polyester

479
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:45,611
and sell you to a foreign lady

480
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:59,115
Little prince is upset.. no problem.

481
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:02,051
I'll pacify him and bring him back

482
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:13,463
Where are you going?
 -to the Station

483
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:15,231
Come back. Everyone's watching

484
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:16,432
I can't get along with him

485
01:02:16,432 --> 01:02:21,304
This is not a silly game
that you get upset and leave

486
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:28,377
I'm going to the village.

487
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:34,617
We'll all go together, and put
up a huge board.. Shakti factory

488
01:02:34,617 --> 01:02:38,087
I don't want any of this

489
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:41,224
People will say that
you're jealous of him

490
01:02:41,224 --> 01:02:43,059
Who will say?
- Even I will!

491
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:44,560
You've gone mad and blind

492
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:47,096
Your problem is with me..

493
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:52,101
..speak properly to your sister

494
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:57,373
Can't you see that he is looking after both of
us. You need to understhand him

495
01:02:57,373 --> 01:03:02,044
He only understands money. Do
you know why he married you?

496
01:03:02,044 --> 01:03:05,448
He was a true friend. He
married a girl who was eloping

497
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,784
He would have married you
even if you were handicapped

498
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:12,321
You know why? Tell her

499
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:14,123
You are talking like a child

500
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:16,592
He married you for dowry.

501
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:18,116
Tell him not to lie.

502
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:20,495
Ask him...

503
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:28,070
Father had promised a
big dowry, 25 thousand..

504
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:31,507
..he wanted to start his business

505
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:33,304
Tell him not to lie...

506
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:37,073
You're just capital.

507
01:03:44,086 --> 01:03:45,280
He's lying, isn't he?

508
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:53,323
Is this true?

509
01:09:13,282 --> 01:09:19,355
Fight with the whole world,
but not with me

510
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:28,964
If you're with me, I
can beat the whole world

511
01:09:28,964 --> 01:09:34,170
Then why are you stuck
to my neck? Come on...

512
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,364
Where?

513
01:09:38,974 --> 01:09:40,100
To beat the world.

514
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:52,247
You've come?

515
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:59,118
On time.

516
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:07,596
How was the Europe and America tour?

517
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:11,066
Very successful.
Only one difficulty..

518
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:14,069
..I didn't get to eat
her cooking I starved

519
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:17,139
business king of India.

520
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:18,274
Do you have Shakti shares?

521
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:19,332
- Yes.

522
01:11:19,408 --> 01:11:22,077
Then you are India's
business king too

523
01:11:22,077 --> 01:11:23,412
People are pointing fingers

524
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:24,743
at your growth.

525
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:27,416
You're growing too fast

526
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:33,622
This is a race, and I ran
to win, not for pleasure

527
01:11:38,227 --> 01:11:40,161
No.
- Hey Jalkukdi...

528
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:44,833
You look beautiful
just like a bride

529
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:46,735
Really? Actually I knew

530
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:50,105
That's why this Parsi
uncle's been troubling me

531
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:56,111
So when are you marrying me?

532
01:11:56,111 --> 01:11:58,614
Leave Didi let' s get
into my car and run away

533
01:11:58,614 --> 01:11:59,774
Can you cook like her?

534
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:03,052
I'm talking love and you're
talking about your stomach..

535
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:07,589
..how do you live with him?

536
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:08,724
With great difficulty
Where's Nanaji?

537
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:10,793
America... he's back in two weeks

538
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:14,063
Gurubhai! Namaste bhabhi

539
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:22,063
How many months?

540
01:12:23,072 --> 01:12:26,408
How did you know, I
haven't even told the beast

541
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:33,082
You glow.. it's a
girl, just like me

542
01:12:33,082 --> 01:12:36,643
Dad. Gurukant Desai.

543
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:40,146
So you're Gurubhai.

544
01:12:40,222 --> 01:12:46,061
And you're the senior Mr
Contractor.. pleasure

545
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:49,030
I've a present for you...

546
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:51,400
..that's why I wanted
you to come to the wedding

547
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:57,106
But I brought a present only
for your daughter not for you

548
01:12:57,106 --> 01:13:03,579
A blank cheque. Your
math is very good

549
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:09,051
So fill it up with any number

550
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:11,519
Everything has a price.

551
01:13:13,322 --> 01:13:16,024
Where you've reached today
on your own, is amazing

552
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:19,016
But the path ends here.

553
01:13:46,622 --> 01:14:55,050
Don't put it down. You might
not get another opportunity

554
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:18,053
Who is it?
- Bloody old man.

555
01:14:18,053 --> 01:14:19,281
He wants to buy me.

556
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:26,028
He is putting a price tag on me?

557
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:31,066
What he made in 150
years I made in 10 years

558
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:33,000
Is it the same?
- No.
