1
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,036
"The history of the Pirate Mack,
the Black Macoco."

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,719
Macoco the dazzling,
Macoco the fabulous...

3
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,030
...the hawk of the sea,
the prince of pirates...

4
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,794
...whose spirit and legend
will live on through the ages...

5
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,077
...for his immortal deeds,
as hereinafter set forth.

6
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,595
And whose glorious
and formidable exploits...

7
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,716
...are here related in a true history.

8
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,429
Staggering to the imagination
and ravishing the sensibilities...

9
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,832
...with tales of wealth, of gold and silver
beyond dreams of avarice...

10
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,073
...of stolen treasure, of maidens captive,
of villages destroyed...

11
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,392
...of cities decimated
for a whim or a caress.

12
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,633
Macoco.

13
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,074
Where are you now?

14
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,759
What seas do you traverse?

15
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,478
Is it sunrise...

16
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,517
...or sunset where you are?

17
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,989
Say, you don't suppose
he's still alive?

18
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,628
Oh, he can't be.
They must have hanged him by now.

19
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,915
They'll never hang him.

20
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,833
On the moving waters
of the Caribbean he darts about...

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,072
...like a dragonfly,
glittering, uncapturable.

22
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,279
Oh, Manuela, the way you talk.
Why, he's nothing but a thief, a criminal.

23
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,998
He's not. He's not.

24
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,879
He's ruthless, magnificent, romantic.

25
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,600
If he saw a woman he wanted,
he'd just come and take <i>her...</i>

26
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,638
...and carry her off on his ship,
but he'd treat her like a queen.

27
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,394
I don't want anyone swooping
down on me like a chicken hawk.

28
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,279
I just want a good, steady man
with a plantation...

29
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,793
...not too big, not too small.

30
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,474
Oh, Casilda, I do wish you
were a little more spiritual.

31
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,632
Don't you ever dream of a man
who will take you out of this village?

32
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,552
Out of this little saucer in the hills?

33
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,393
- Don't you ever...?
- Manuela.

34
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,788
Yes, Aunt Inez?

35
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,794
Oh, my lamb, my sweet,
I've glorious news for you.

36
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,949
What is it, Aunt Inez?

37
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,873
I got you a husband.

38
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,959
You'll be the first of us.

39
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,678
Is it anybody I know?

40
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,115
Oh, you've probably seen him
pass in his carriage.

41
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,840
It's Don Pedro Vargas.

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,752
Don Pedro, the new mayor?

43
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,115
Manuela, you'll be the mayor's wife.

44
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,508
But he has a big bay window.

45
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,036
And why not? He lives well.
Who wouldn't have?

46
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,394
But he's so unromantic.

47
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,472
Oh, I don't know,
he's not so unromantic, for a rich man.

48
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,359
- He's the richest man on the island.
- You'll be Doña Manuela.

49
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,796
- You'll live in the mayor's house.
- He'll never be content to settle here.

50
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,235
- He's been all over the world.
- Isn't that marvelous?

51
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,960
He's on his way to meet you.
So if you'll forgive <i>us...</i>

52
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,634
- Oh, I think it's wonderful.
- Oh, isn't that exciting?

53
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,277
Show a little more feeling, Manuela.

54
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,431
You're the happiest girl
in the world today.

55
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,589
Oh, of course I am.

56
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,830
It's just that it's happening
so suddenly that...

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,515
Sudden? Why, I've been working
with the lawyers for two months.

58
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,591
You're an orphan with no dowry,
Manuela.

59
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,435
You must be aware your uncle and I
have been in great financial difficulties.

60
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,828
Oh, I know, Aunt Inez.

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,389
Your poor father and mother,
may they rest in peace...

62
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,551
...couldn't have loved
and sheltered you more.

63
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,792
Now you will have an opportunity
of helping us.

64
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,599
Besides making a most advantageous
marriage for yourself.

65
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,877
I know, Aunt Inez,
and I'm very grateful, really I am.

66
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,270
It's just that I shan't know
what to say to him.

67
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,953
Oh, say nothing.

68
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,112
He's not marrying you
to listen to you.

69
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,274
Don Pedro,
welcome to our modest home.

70
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,908
I enter as a humble suppliant.
Where is she?

71
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,878
Cecile, tell the Señorita Manuela
we are awaiting her.

72
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,828
I have just broken the news to her,
the wonderful news.

73
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,479
She is overwhelmed.

74
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,437
Oh, you make me
the happiest of men.

75
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,669
I had been fearful.

76
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,398
After all, I am a self-made man...

77
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,074
...without the tradition
and culture of your family.

78
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,552
And then, there is a certain,
shall we say, disparity in our ages.

79
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,915
Disparity? Nonsense.

80
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,275
Manuela wouldn't look
at some callow youth.

81
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,635
- She said that?
- I said it.

82
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,075
Oh, she is speechless.

83
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,596
Well, of course l...
I do not come to her empty-handed.

84
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,479
True. There are a few things
to be made clear.

85
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,471
Capucho?

86
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,790
Oh, Capucho, my darling.

87
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,679
Your newly found nephew
eagerly awaits your blessings.

88
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,512
- He has them.
- Where's the list?

89
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,434
Now, a few items that I jotted down,
in case they slipped my mind.

90
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,319
Don Pedro, the arrangements
have been more than generous...

91
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,959
...but there are some things...

92
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,113
capucho's gambling debts,
a matter of honor.

93
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,637
Wouldn't it be more simple to turn the
payments yearly instead of monthly?

94
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,268
Anything, anything you wish.
Take it up with my lawyers.

95
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,557
Oh, of course.
You're getting impatient.

96
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,280
I'll see what's keeping her.

97
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,873
Manuela...!

98
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,552
My dear, allow me to present
the man you are affianced to marry.

99
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,315
Manuela.

100
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,677
I have lived for two years in this
village and I've watched you grow up.

101
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,274
I have traveled and I can say
without boasting...

102
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,795
...that I have seen the fairest women
in the world.

103
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,350
Yet I would pass them all by
for one smile from you.

104
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,392
- Charming, isn't he?
- Yes.

105
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,391
You not only have his love
and devotion...

106
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,154
<i>...he's</i> ordered furniture
for your house from Seville...

107
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,835
...brocades from France,
tapestries from Italy...

108
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,357
...and, best of all, your trousseau
has been made by Maison Worth...

109
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,795
...the choicest house in Paris.

110
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,359
Paris.

111
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,635
Paris!

112
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,031
- That pleases you?
- Oh, yes.

113
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,034
Yes. To see Paris!
All my life I've dreamed of that.

114
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,589
The gaiety and color and people.

115
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,034
I've seen it all.

116
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,999
Yes. And the lovely women
all dressed for the evening...

117
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,152
...going to some carnival...
- I shall be happy to tell you about it.

118
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,996
Oh, but you would never be content
to settle here.

119
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,232
Not someone who loves
to travel as you do.

120
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,719
On the contrary...

121
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,952
...traveling involves the sea,
and I cannot bear the sea.

122
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,231
Take my word for it, Manuela.

123
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,799
Home is the perfect spot.

124
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,350
So quiet, so peaceful, so safe.

125
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,513
Home.

126
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,949
May I, please?

127
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,634
Oh, what an exquisite ring.

128
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,836
You must have bought it
on your travels.

129
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,275
Manuela, look at it.
Have you ever seen...

130
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,000
...such a wonderful design?

131
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,078
He is the most thoughtful,
the most generous of men. Isn't he?

132
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,439
Yes, Aunt Inez.

133
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,198
I can't wait to see your trousseau.

134
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,510
It should arrive at Port Sebastion
any time now.

135
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,631
Port Sebastion?

136
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,469
Couldn't we go to Port Sebastion
to meet the ship?

137
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,876
Drive 30 miles to meet a ship?

138
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,917
Well, there are dressmakers
at the port...

139
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,753
...and there are sure to be alterations.

140
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,432
Please, Aunt Inez,
I'd so love to see the caribbean.

141
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,431
Caribbean?

142
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,472
Why the Caribbean?

143
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,438
Because it...
It holds a special fascination for me.

144
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,558
It means romance and adventure...

145
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,918
...and, as I shall never have any...

146
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,114
Manuela...

147
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,794
...don't you realize
you're marrying a saint?

148
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,916
Morning and night,
you should burn incense.

149
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,992
You should offer up prayers
and thanks.

150
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,435
I'll make him a good wife.

151
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,472
Really, Aunt Inez.

152
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,310
I realize that there's a practical world
and a dream world.

153
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,311
I know which is which.

154
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,948
I shan't mix them. I promise.

155
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,834
- That's better.
- But if I could only see the Caribbean...

156
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,037
...and just once before I marry,
I'd never speak of it again, ever.

157
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,111
Well, we'll see.

158
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,358
We'll see.

159
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,715
Ladies and gentlemen,
your most kind attention.

160
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,953
Allow me to announce
the arrival of the greatest galaxy...

161
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,872
...of gifted entertainers on Earth.

162
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,271
A brilliant company
of sensational thespians.

163
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,557
And before you,
or should I say above you...

164
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,551
...you see their star.

165
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,359
Serafin of Madrid, Serafin the Great.

166
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,230
The master juggler, conjurer,
dancer and singer of songs.

167
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,879
I and my genial troupe come to you
directly from our triumphs abroad...

168
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,918
...where we have played before
all of the crowned heads of Europe.

169
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,675
We bring to this new world
all the joy, the dexterity...

170
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,516
...the romance of the old,
to please, astonish and delight you.

171
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,399
Tonight we will entertain you
in the heart of your fair city.

172
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:32,554
Performance at 8:30.
Come one. Come all. Children half price.

173
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,159
Citizens of Port Sebastion, behold
the dramatis personae of whom I speak.

174
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,878
Fellow artists:

175
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,794
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Bolo.

176
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,076
Do not confuse him
with ordinary buffoons...

177
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,710
...for his performance on the trapeze
has never been equaled.

178
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,199
And Trillo.

179
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,920
He can juggle seven balls
at the same time...

180
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,390
...balancing a sharp sword
on the tip of his nose.

181
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,791
And for those of more romantic bent,
there is Gumbo...

182
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,871
...who imitates the love call
of the lark...

183
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,918
...at the same time
drinking a cup of water.

184
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,073
And these two canine marvels
of the animal kingdom...

185
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,959
...who walk like dogs
but think like men.

186
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,350
Ladies and gentlemen, come tonight...

187
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,717
...and see for yourselves
the magic of our art.

188
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,869
Going someplace?

189
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,591
Ah, yes. I go to survey the terrain
in advance of conquest.

190
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,591
How do you manage
to get out of the work?

191
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,149
- Yeah.
- Gumbo, do not ask me to explain...

192
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,548
...the mysteries of genius.

193
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,199
- Now, wait a minute...
- Boys...

194
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,794
...here is my last cigar.

195
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,950
Divide it among you.

196
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,279
I was keeping it lit for you.

197
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,758
Niña.

198
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,518
Beautiful town you have here, sir.
Beautiful.

199
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,036
- You're one of the actors, aren't you?
- Then you know.

200
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,998
Niña.

201
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,155
Niña.

202
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,276
Say, why do call all the girls Niña?

203
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,668
My friend...

204
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,072
...there are so many beautiful girls
in the world with so many names...

205
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,471
...I find it very confusing.
So I've simplified things.

206
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,312
I use one name.

207
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,755
But why... Why did you pick Niña?

208
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,512
Yes, why Niña?

209
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,238
Why not?

210
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,029
<i>When I arrive in any town</i>

211
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,594
<i>I look the ladies up and down</i>

212
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,510
<i>And when I pick my favorite flame</i>

213
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,231
<i>This is my patter, no matter her name</i>

214
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,713
- Niña.
- My name is Luisa.

215
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,793
But you could be Niña for me.
Couldn't you? Niña?

216
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,873
<i>Niña, Niña, Niña, Niña</i>

217
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,508
<i>Fascinating Niña</i>

218
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,070
<i>What a lovely child</i>

219
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:37,554
<i>Niña, you enchant me</i>
<i>Niña, you're so sweet, I mean you</i>

220
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,349
<i>Fairly drive me wild</i>

221
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:46,548
<i>Niña, till the moment you hit my heart</i>

222
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,759
<i>Niña, I was doing just fine</i>

223
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,275
<i>But since I've seen you</i>

224
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,874
<i>Niña, Niña, Niña</i>

225
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,429
<i>I'll be having neurasthenia</i>

226
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,160
<i>Till I make you mine</i>
<i>Till I make you</i>

227
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,914
<i>Till I make you mine,</i>
<i>till I make you mine</i>

228
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,753
<i>Till I make you mine</i>

229
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,239
<i>Niña, Niña, Niña, Niña</i>

230
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,918
<i>Niña, Niña, Niña, Niña</i>

231
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,311
<i>Niña, till the moment you hit my heart</i>

232
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,916
<i>Niña, I was doing just fine</i>

233
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,471
<i>But since I've seen you</i>
<i>Niña, Niña, Niña</i>

234
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,949
<i>I'll be having neurasthenia</i>

235
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,557
<i>Till I make you mine, till I make you mine</i>
<i>Till I make you mine, till I make you mine</i>

236
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,594
Niña.

237
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,270
<i>You're the prize gardenia</i>

238
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,591
<i>Of the Spanish Main</i>

239
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,318
<i>Niña</i>

240
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,550
<i>Don 't be so enticing</i>

241
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,030
<i>Or I'll go insane</i>

242
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,758
<i>Niña</i>

243
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,669
<i>Niña, till alas I gazed in your eyes</i>

244
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,435
<i>Niña, I was mentally fine</i>

245
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,196
<i>But since I've seen you</i>
<i>Niña, Niña, Niña</i>

246
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,717
<i>I'll be having schizophrenia</i>
<i>Till I make you...</i>

247
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,955
Oh, look, Aunt Inez, the sea.

248
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,999
- Manuela, what will people think?
- Señora Alva, welcome, and señorita.

249
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,118
Your boxes have arrived
and the dressmaker is awaiting you.

250
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,840
- Splendid. Splendid. Come Manuela.
- No, please, Aunt Inez.

251
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,275
- Let me see the sea. You promised.
- We can go later.

252
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,273
- You needn't come. I can go alone.
- Alone? Are you mad?

253
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,193
No one knows me here.
I'll be back in a half an hour.

254
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,349
Manuela.

255
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,873
Manue...!

256
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,032
Who are you?

257
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,839
In Madrid...

258
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,595
...I hear that young ladies do not
walk out without their duennas.

259
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,072
However, I should have thought
that in a town like Port Sebastion...

260
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,878
...bodyguards were unnecessary.

261
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,157
You, gracious lady,
will always need a bodyguard.

262
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,914
Even in the lonely wastes
of the Sahara Desert...

263
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,230
...the sands would rise up
and follow you.

264
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,392
Tell me, what is your name?

265
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,674
I do not see
how that could possibly concern you.

266
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,719
It is as vital to me as the beat
of my heart. Are you married?

267
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,074
No.

268
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,595
But I will be by this time next week.

269
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,149
Then you should never step
into the sight of other men.

270
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,515
It is too great a provocation.

271
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,957
Very well,
I shall remove the provocation.

272
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,314
Señorita, don't marry that pumpkin.

273
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,755
- Pumpkin?
- Any man who lets you out of his sight...

274
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,478
...is a pumpkin.

275
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,314
My affianced is a very noble
and pious man.

276
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,631
He doesn't drink. He doesn't smoke.
He's regular in his church duties.

277
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,031
And he would never accost
a strange young woman on a...

278
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,597
I wish you would stop circling me
this way. It's like talking to a top.

279
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,829
You bewilder me.

280
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,436
A young girl like you with beauty,
youth, enchantment...

281
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,636
...throwing yourself away
on a lump like that.

282
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,313
He's neither a lump nor a pumpkin.

283
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,950
If he had any sense, he should have
known he wasn't good enough for you.

284
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,554
- He would have stepped aside.
- Stepped aside? For what?

285
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,359
For someone who could appreciate you,
like me. Don't laugh.

286
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,239
If I didn't laugh, I should be very
annoyed. Please let me go.

287
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,119
- Never.
- Don't be silly.

288
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,474
I love you.

289
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,358
- And love isn't silly.
- Really.

290
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,919
Aren't you interested in love?

291
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,116
No.
I told you I was going to be married.

292
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,158
In England and America,
they have a strange custom.

293
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,710
The ladies pick their own husbands
and they marry them for love.

294
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,155
Yes, I know.
It's a very stupid custom.

295
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,517
Oh, I see.
You find enough romance in daydreams.

296
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,874
What do you mean?

297
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,032
- I'm sure I have no idea what you...
- Don't tell me you never <i>long...</i>

298
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,872
...for a prince instead of a pumpkin.

299
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,871
- Certainly not.
- I don't believe you.

300
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,271
I know that underneath that prim exterior
there are depths of emotion...

301
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,000
...romantic longings, unfulfilled dreams.
- That's absurd.

302
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,958
I can read your mind,
your innermost thoughts.

303
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,189
It's my business.

304
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,352
I can tell you your past,
your present and your future.

305
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,875
You don't have to tell me my future,
I know my future.

306
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,075
- Am I in it?
- No.

307
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,834
Then you don't know your future.

308
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,991
Come see me tonight
and you'll find out.

309
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,798
I'll leave a seat for you.

310
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,678
Just mention my name:

311
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,796
Serafin.

312
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,036
An actor.

313
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,468
Ladies and gentlemen,
step in and see the show...

314
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,153
...the wonder show of the ages.

315
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,710
Sensational songs that will set your
heart to singing. Demons of the dance.

316
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,155
Canine marvels
of the nineteenth century.

317
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,198
They walk, they talk,
they're even human at times.

318
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,511
And we're also proud
to present Gumbo and Estraban...

319
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,673
...dashing, debonair, death-defying
masters of the swinging trapeze.

320
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,159
Friends, this is Bolo.

321
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,630
He will step amongst you with tickets,
passports to paradise and happiness.

322
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,475
Only two reals, friends. Two reals.
Step around, will you, Bolo, please?

323
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,034
Magic. Mesmerism.

324
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,079
Ladies and gentlemen,
the show is about to go on.

325
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,991
Hurtado. Where's the revolving mirror?

326
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,993
- What do you want with that?
- Never mind. Where is it?

327
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,829
Is it wound?

328
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,877
Is it oiled? Is it true?

329
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,634
- You're not gonna use it?
- Certainly. Take it on, Gumbo.

330
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,518
Oh, it's like a graveyard out there.

331
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,557
It's a challenge.
We shall galvanize them.

332
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,153
- Don't use the mirror.
- Why not?

333
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,834
The last person you hypnotized
hasn't woked up yet.

334
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,959
That was a mistake. I had the misfortune
to pick a man with sleeping sickness.

335
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,630
Now we come
to the pinnacle of our entertainment.

336
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,155
An experiment in the new
and sensational science...

337
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,469
...of animal magnetism...

338
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,915
...taught me
by the great Mesmer himself.

339
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,719
You know, of course,
the principles of the great Mesmer?

340
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,632
In short...

341
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,632
...hypnosis.

342
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,159
Hypnosis.

343
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,438
Now, ladies and gentlemen, before your
eyes, I shall perform this experiment...

344
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,431
...but I shall need some help.

345
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,431
However, it must be the right person.

346
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,114
Control cannot be exercised
over everyone.

347
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,717
I have failed with the confused,
with the rebellious, with the recalcitrant.

348
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,189
To perform the experiment ideally...

349
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,511
...I must have a pure person.

350
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,594
One pure person.

351
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,949
Nymph...

352
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,636
...in thy orisons
be all my sins remembered.

353
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,279
Purity at last.

354
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,474
Purity. Gracious lady, that you should
be here makes it indeed a blessing.

355
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,155
Come. Come. I, Serafin, ask it.

356
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,957
You know whatever I ask you...

357
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,874
...whatever power I have for you
is for your happiness.

358
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,116
Sit, gracious lady.

359
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,748
Pure spirit, rest.

360
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,149
She is now in a trance.

361
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,633
I am about to release her spirit
from its earthly bonds.

362
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,429
Gracious lady, what is your name?

363
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,913
Your name.

364
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,999
Man... Manuela.

365
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,752
Manuela, where do you live?

366
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,115
In the village of Calvados.

367
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,952
Make a note of that.

368
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,317
Manuela, you don't love the man
you're going to marry, do you?

369
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,232
- No.
- You love someone else, don't you?

370
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,595
- Yes.
- Who is that other, Manuela?

371
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,352
Someone you've just met, isn't he?

372
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,511
Perhaps this very afternoon.

373
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,033
Think.

374
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,149
Think.

375
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,519
Somewhere by the sea?

376
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,233
Yes.

377
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,989
The sea.

378
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,197
Who is he, Manuela? Say his name.

379
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,874
- He is...
- Yes?

380
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,316
Macoco.

381
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,759
Macoco?

382
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,478
Macoco.

383
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,675
Macoco the pirate?

384
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,354
Macoco the fabulous.
Macoco the dazzling.

385
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,272
No. No, Manuela.
You don't mean that.

386
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,432
Someday he'll swoop down on me
like a chicken hawk and carry me away.

387
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,273
- No, Manuela. Pure soul, listen...
- And I shall do his bidding.

388
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,399
I shall follow him, yea, to the ends
of the world I shall follow him.

389
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,438
No, Manuela. Forget Macoco.

390
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,352
Now think again, pure soul...

391
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,159
Don't call me pure soul.
It irritates me.

392
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,357
Underneath this prim exterior
there are emotions, romantic longings.

393
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,273
- I know. I'm here to release them.
- Underneath this exterior...

394
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,512
...there are emotions, romantic longings.
Underneath this exterior...

395
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,433
- ...there's emotions, romantic longings.
- Wake up. Wake up.

396
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,749
Macoco.

397
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,478
Macoco.

398
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,676
Macoco.

399
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,435
<i>There's a pirate known to fame</i>

400
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,593

00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,151

<i>As a child his nurse foretold</i>

410
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,633
<i>Mack was sure to be a pirate bold</i>

411
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,598
<i>For when feeding time would come</i>

412
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,672
<i>Mack'd have a bottle</i>

<i>Mack'd have a bottle</i>

<i>When he'd sight a clipper ship</i>

420
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,752
<i>Mack would board her and begin to clip</i>

421
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,673
<i>First he'd grab the ladies fair</i>

422
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,877

<i>Those with jewels to spare</i>

<i>Gals would trail him</i>
<i>Like a pack of hounds</i>

429

Return to yourself.

Wake.

457
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,154
- Can't you wake her?
- You'll be jailed for this.

458
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,356
Use voodoo.
Get her out of it with voodoo.

459
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,273
- Use rattlesnake skins and vinegar.
- They say lizard milk and...

460
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,670
- Burn a feather under her nose.
- Let me try again.

461
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,400
Stand back. Stand back.

462
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,868
They're cheering for you,
for your singing and dancing.

463
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,031
- Singing and danc...
- You've set them on fire.

464
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,599
No.

465
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,599
No!

Aunt Inez. Aunt Inez. Wake up. I wanna
go home. I wanna go home this minute.

470
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,473
- But it's still dark.
- I don't care. I want to go home.

471
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,871
Oh, well, we might as well.
We'll never sleep a wink here.

472
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,510
Oh, I've never known such a noisy place.
Those actors.

473
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,591
They had a girl too.
I heard her singing.

474
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,478
A girl? A girl?

475
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,993
Oh, it sounded like a girl.

476
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,152
Oh, Aunt Inez, Don Pedro was right.
He was right.

477
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,880
Home, it's safe.
It's safe, it's protected and it's quiet.

478
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,077
- Yes, it's quiet. Yes. Yes...
- I wanna go home. Hurry, please.

479
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,038
- Come on, Aunt Inez, please hurry.
- Manuela, wait...

480
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,029
Manuela,
it's going to be a beautiful silhouette.

481
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,589
Señor Gomez,
I would like an extra copy for our salon.

482
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,593
The señorita is the loveliest bride
I have ever painted.

483
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,432
- Thank you...
- Don't move, please.

484
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,556
Would you like a bouquet
in the corner?

485
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,233
No, no. It spoils the composition.

486
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,756
One moment more. There.
The outline is complete.

487
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,473
Thank you.

488
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,670
The sun is shining for you today.
A good omen.

489
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,479
My Manuela, the wife of our mayor.

490
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,074
You're going to be so happy.

491
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,118
What if I'm not?

492
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,795
You will be, my dear,
if you wish for it hard enough.

493
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,793
You can make anything come true
by wishing for it.

494
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,949
Anything?

495
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,873
Anything.

496
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,272
Men, right here. Set up over here.

497
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,391
Manuela, come along.
We have to start.

498
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,279
No. Aunt Inez, I can't go.

499
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,714
- I can't.
- Now, now, Manuela.

500
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,519
- I know exactly how you're...
- Aunt Inez, it's that actor.

501
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,874
- Actor?
- He's here.

502
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,679
He's coming in the house.
I daren't leave.

503
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,355
Now, Manuela.

504
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,909
Please calm down and tell me
what you're talking about.

505
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,117
Aunt Inez, I have something dreadful
to tell you.

506
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,352
Do you remember in Port Sebastion...

507
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,590
...when you thought
you heard a girl singing?

508
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,193
You did. It was me.

509
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,194
I can't believe it. It can't be true.

510
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,430
Oh, do you think I'd make up
a thing like that?

511
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,876
- How could you? Whatever possessed...
- I don't know, I don't know.

512
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,430
He had a mirror that spun around
and his voice and his eyes, and l...

513
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,276
Capucho. Oh, Capucho.

514
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,839
I want you to listen carefully.

515
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,515
Bolt the front door
and don't let anyone in. You understand?

516
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,355
- My dear, if I may make a suggestion?
- Yes, of course. Hurry. Manuela.

517
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,631
I'm going for Don Pedro.

518
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,836
- Lock the door and don't leave the room.
- No.

519
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,515
- Now, don't leave it.
- No, I won't. Oh, lock the door.

520
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,800
Lock the door and
don't leave this room.

521
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,712
Lock the door
and don't leave this room.

522
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,869
Lock the door...

523
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,029
Manuela.

524
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,595
No.

525
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,749
No.

526
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,957
No.

527
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,431
Fair Juliet of the Caribbean.

528
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,639
Go away.

529
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,872
Trillo. Trillo, me jacket.

530
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,960
Ta-da.

531
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,589
Manuela.

532
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,593
Don't you dare take another step
across that wire.

533
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,795
Don't you dare.

534
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,794
Manuela. Manuela, you don't mean that.
You don't mean that.

535
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,439
All right.

536
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,635
Do you see these? Do you see these?

537
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,679
I'm going to count to three.
Count to three. One, two...

538
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,996
Three.

539
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,109
All right. You've asked for this.

540
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,510
You should have thought of this
before you started.

541
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,910
You know, you know
you wouldn't cut that rope.

542
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,913
Manuela, you couldn't do that.

543
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,073
Please.

544
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,878
Don't come any nearer.

545
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,315
It looks so bad.

546
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,632
Go away. I'm going to be married.

547
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,552
- Go away. Don't come near me.
- Manuela.

548
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,190
- Don't come near me. Leave me alone
- Manuela. Wait. We're here, Manuela.

549
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,749
- We've come to get you.
- Leave me alone.

550
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,195
Manuela, are you real or an angel?

551
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,158
- How dare you come here.
- Have I walked the tightrope to heaven?

552
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,118
- How dare you!
- That wedding gown, that veil.

553
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,078
It isn't possible that you're still thinking
of getting married.

554
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,754
Not after that night.
Not after hearing that applause...

555
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,434
- Oh, stop it. Stop it.
...and seeing those people.

556
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,954
Can't you understand I have nothing
but horror and shame...

557
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,394
...for what I did that night?

558
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,109
Horror? Shame? You were wonderful.

559
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,396
Believe me,
you gave a brilliant performance.

560
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,357
And with polish, you'll be even better.

561
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,875
- Will you go now?
- Oh, Manuela, come with us.

562
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,315
We'll tour these enchanted islands,
then on to Rome.

563
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,550
- You wanna disgrace me, ruin me.
- Madrid, Paris.

564
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,233
My fiancé will be here any minute.

565
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,436
- Well, let's go quickly.
- No.

566
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,795
Manuela, you can't marry that man.

567
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,394
You're not in love with him,
you're in love with me.

568
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,154
- Oh, the ego, the conceit.
- You told me so that night.

569
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,356
- What?
- Not in so many words, perhaps.

570
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,398
But when I held you in my arms
and kissed you, you clung to me.

571
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,120
Oh, how cruel to remind me of that.

572
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,999
You fooled me. You made a fool of me
and you tricked me.

573
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,593
Manuela, all my life...

574
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,639
<i>...I've</i> searched for someone who could
fill the void in my heart. I've found you.

575
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,199
Oh, come with me.

576
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,033
Once and for all, I do not love you.

577
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,158
I know it's hard for you to believe
but I do not love you.

578
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,550
Then why didn't you cut that rope
with your shears?

579
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,994
You would have been rid of me.

580
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,673
I wish I had now.

581
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,751
Now, will you get out of here?

582
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,115
- You won't come with me?
- No.

583
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,998
Very well, then.

584
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,394
It isn't essential
for you to love me to be in the troupe.

585
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,869
It helps, but it isn't essential.

586
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,598
Get out.

587
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,279
- Goodbye.
- No, not that way. You'll kill yourself.

588
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,555
- You do care.
- No, I don't.

589
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,869
- You do care.
- No, I don't.

590
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,439
- Manuela, you love me.
- I don't.

591
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,592
You love me. You love me, Manuela.
You love me.

592
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,275
Don Pedro will take care
of that mountebank.

593
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,876
- Who's that man with the whip?
- Manuela's fiancé.

594
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,158
- He's also mayor of the town.
- Mayor.

595
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,914
- All right, boys, start packing.
- Okay, let's go. Let's go.

596
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,548
I tell you you're wrong.
You're making a great mistake.

597
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:22,951
I warn you, if you stop my marriage,
I'll hate you. I'll despise you.

598
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,998
All I'm asking you is to appear
with us once, just once.

599
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,229
- Sing one song.
- No.

600
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,879
Just to know what a thrill it is.

601
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,679
You were in a trance.
You couldn't hear the audience before.

602
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,308
You call it a thrill to live in a tent?
To be a vagabond?

603
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,436
- A vagabond?
- To be chased out of every town?

604
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,750
- You don't...
- To be looked down on by all people?

605
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,195
- Looked down upo...?
- Manuela.

606
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,959
If he finds you, he'll kill you.

607
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,031
Manuela. Manuela, let me in.

608
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,077
No. Don't... Don't come in, Don Pedro.

609
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,516
I'm in my wedding dress and it's
bad luck to see me in my wedding dress.

610
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,636
Let me in.

611
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,318
Please. Please, get out of here.

612
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,755
Not unless you come with me.

613
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,353
You fool.

614
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,873
You fool.

615
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,713
Manuela. Are you all right?

616
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,758
Don Pedro,
he didn't mean any harm. Please.

617
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,398
- Take Manuela away.
- Please, Don Pedro.

618
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,549
Take her away.

619
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,948
He didn't mean any harm.

620
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,709
He'll kill him.

621
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,518
Never mind.
He's none of our business.

622
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,592
He'll kill him, I know.
I know he'll kill him.

623
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,113
Something dreadful will happen.

624
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,872
You mountebank.

625
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,031
You thieving vagabond.

626
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,270
You scum,
sneaking into a lady's room.

627
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,671
Sneaking? You can hardly call it sneaking
when I walk a tightrope...

628
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,957
...across your main thoroughfare.
- I'll put you in irons.

629
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,111
I'll have you publicly flogged.

630
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,953
A lash across your back for every step
along that rope.

631
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:57,157
- What, sir?
- This is a respectable community.

632
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,039
We do not entertain the scum
of the cities.

633
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,078
The thieves, the vagabonds,
such as you.

634
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,388
Speak more, master, speak more.

635
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,952
I'm mayor in this town.

636
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,475
My word is law.
I give you five minutes.

637
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:17,031
Exactly five minutes for you and your
malodorous riffraff to get out of town.

638
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,158
Take your choice, get out
or I'll have you mercilessly flogged.

639
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,389
- That voice.
- Get out.

640
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,471
You and your scurvy troupe of actors.

641
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:28,077
Macoco!

642
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,391
Merciful saints of heaven.

643
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,918
Does that stir old memories, Macoco?

644
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,877
Would you like to hear it again,
Macoco?

645
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,316
No. No, for the love of heaven, no.

646
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,833
Go away.

647
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,758
Go away.

648
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,273
- Who are you?
- I am one of your rare mistakes.

649
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,795
You didn't quite succeed in killing me.

650
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,030
Very careless of you.

651
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,156
Do you remember the merchant ship
<i>Capricorn...</i>

652
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,515
...you sunk off the coast of Algiers?

653
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,830
I happened to be on it.

654
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,510
I was returning from my very
first theatrical engagement.

655
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,750
Quite successful one too.

656
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,675
Well, you threw me overboard and
you left me thinking I had drowned...

657
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,149
...but it's hard to kill an actor.

658
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,470
Of course, I wouldn't expect you
to remember me.

659
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,473
One victim out of so many hundreds.

660
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,234
But I remember you.

661
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,079
My heart. My heart.

662
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,151
Too much soft living, Macoco.

663
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,550
Don't say that name.

664
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,951
I never thought I'd live
to see this day.

665
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,317
Mack the Black,
scourge of the seven seas.

666
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,598
Murderer, torturer, pillager,
lying quivering like a sick jellyfish.

667
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:02,150
You know, last time we met, you were
lithe. You were supple. You were strong.

668
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,880
You could split a man in two
with a stroke of your cutlass.

669
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,191
What do you want? I'll give you anything
if you'll keep your mouth shut.

670
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,158
- I'll give you a thousand pesos.
- A thousand pesos.

671
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,072
It seems to me I remember a poster:

672
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:17,074
"Macoco. Wanted for hanging.
Reward, 100,000 pesos."

673
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:21,631
- Very well, then. 100,000.
- I'm an artist, not a blackmailer.

674
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,872
There's a crowd down there.
Perhaps they'd like to know their mayor.

675
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,359
Have you no pity? No heart?

676
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:29,193
Don't do this to me.
Look, I'm respectable now.

677
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,590
I've made a place for myself
in this community.

678
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,830
I'm very philanthropic.

679
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,911
I repaired the church belfry.

680
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,308
For the love of heaven...

681
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,392
...have mercy on me. If not for my sake,
then for Manuela's.

682
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,870
Look, what would she do if she
knew that I were Macoco the pirate?

683
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,838
Yes, what would Manuela do if...

684
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,478
I beg you don't tell her.

685
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,313
Is there no compassion in your heart
for a sinner who repents?

686
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,438
- I beg you, on my knees.
- Quiet.

687
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,113
I want you to go out on that balcony
and announce to the town...

688
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,397
...that my troupe will perform tonight
and you will be our patron.

689
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,232
Oh, be reasonable. I can't do that.

690
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,278
- Maco...
- No, no, no, no.

691
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,153
Fellow citizens.

692
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,115
Your attention, please.

693
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,388
Because this is a memorable day
in my life...

694
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:29,836
...I have decided to relax my usual rule
against strangers in our town.

695
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,190
I have decided to allow these...

696
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,710
These strolling players...

697
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,519
...to entertain us with a performance.

698
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,596
Thank heavens he's still alive.

699
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,193
Are you mad?

700
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,750
The man is a devil incarnate.
He'll twist anyone to his purpose.

701
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,117
We must get out of his reach. Capucho,
tell them to bring the carriage.

702
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,748
Come, Manuela.
We'll take shelter in the church.

703
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,955
No one is to leave this house
without my permission.

704
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,633
What right have you to give orders?

705
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,756
What have you done to Don Pedro?

706
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:06,469
Don Pedro is simply feeling
the normal reaction to fear.

707
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,278
Fear? Why should he fear you?

708
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,508
He knows who I am.

709
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:11,669
Well, what are you?

710
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,671
Some pickpurse or chicken thief?

711
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,673
Señora, your village is isolated
and remote...

712
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,593
...but even here
you must have heard the name...

713
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,273
...Macoco.

714
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,671
Macoco?

715
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,874
But you can't be. You're... You're a...

716
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,109
A strolling player?

717
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:37,834
Manuela, even a man desperately in
love has the instinct of self-preservation.

718
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,309
If it were known that Macoco
was on this island...

719
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,916
...all the vultures of the Caribbean
would be on my trail.

720
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,269
Now that you know,
you must make your choice.

721
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:55,150
A life of splendid danger with me
or a sorry existence with this...

722
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,514
...this creature.

723
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,432
What is he saying?

724
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:01,478
- What has he told you?
- Simply the truth.

725
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,433
The truth?

726
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,593
- What truth?
- Is it warm? Are you...? You're sweating.

727
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,034
What is he saying?

728
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,475
Whatever he's told you,
it's a lie. It's a gross lie.

729
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,677
Are you accusing Macoco of lying?

730
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:17,958
Think twice before you answer,
Pedro or whatever you call yourself.

731
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,759
What? What is this?

732
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,559
- What are you saying?
- This fat pumpkin...

733
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,753
...was traveling on a ship
I captured once. I spared his life.

734
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,309
But I may not be so kind this time.

735
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,189
One word from me, you know,
and you'll be hanging from a gibbet.

736
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,349
Please, please.

737
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,317
Capucho, do something.

738
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,393
I sense in this room an air
of strangulated discomfort.

739
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,471
These must be relatives.
Remove them.

740
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,074
Yes, yes. I think you'd better go.

741
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,277
Go on, go on. Leave the house.
I'm telling you to leave the house.

742
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,112
Can't you hear me? Get out of here.

743
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,351
Why don't you go away?

744
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,993
Get out.

745
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,718
You should try underplaying sometime.
Very effective.

746
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,355
Well, Manuela, are you ready
to come with me?

747
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,069
I have engagements on the seven seas.
Will you keep them with me?

748
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,190
No, no. We're not for each other.

749
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:18,353
Oh, we'll have a glorious life,
the open road, the canopy of the skies.

750
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:21,512
But... I hardly know you.

751
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,389
I hardly know you either.
We'll have the excitement of discovery.

752
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,278
But I, l...

753
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,796
- Do you two realize that I'm in the room?
- Must I remind you...

754
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,758
I won't stand by and allow you
to make love to my affianced wife.

755
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,638
You won't do what?
What won't you do?

756
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,315
- Lf I could see you for a moment alone...
- I have no time for sniveling cowards.

757
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,074
There are too many things
to be done. In the first place...

758
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,754
...I must have accommodations
for myself and my men.

759
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:47,150
I'll see what I can do for you
at the inn.

760
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,796
We'll stay at no scurvy inn.

761
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,555
If I know you, you'll have the best
house in town. We'll take that.

762
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,676
Look, be reasonable. I can't do that.

763
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,751
Now, please, Don Pedro,
don't make him angry.

764
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,717
But l... We are to be married.

765
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,078
They are waiting for us at the church.

766
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:09,598
Oh, the marriage, the marriage.
The marriage is postponed, indefinitely.

767
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,556
I shall see you later.

768
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,232
Macoco.

769
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,118
He won't get away with this.

770
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,838
He won't get away with this.

771
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,436
Manuela. Manuela. Are you all right?

772
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,313
Halt.

773
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,518
Dismount.

774
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,678
If you're thinking of riding to the
capital for help, you're idiots.

775
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,751
My crew and I are not alone.

776
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,673
The town is surrounded.
Those hills are full of my men.

777
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,353
Bloodthirsty men.

778
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:06,195
Cutthroats, who only await my signal
to come down and lay this town to ruin.

779
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,588
- Hey, boss.
- Trillo.

780
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,832
There is no necessity of keeping up
this pretense any longer.

781
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,718
They know that I am Macoco.

782
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,313
- Macoco?
- Trillo.

783
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,436
Go immediately
to Don Pedro Vargas' <i>house...</i>

784
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,318
...and arrange our quarters. Go ahead.

785
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,354
Do not anger Macoco.

786
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:26,470
Do not bring down Macoco's wrath
upon your heads.

787
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,594
Macoco!

788
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,399
Macoco!

789
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:24,349
Citizens of Calvados, listen carefully.

790
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,158
I know you do not want bloodshed.

791
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,754
I know you want to cooperate.

792
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,997
- Anything. Anything.
- Anything you ask for, reverend pirate.

793
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:34,391
Good. There is a young lady in this town
who has been fortunate enough...

794
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,437
...to have found favor in my eyes.

795
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,034
I wish her to be brought to me
at once.

796
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,551
Her name...

797
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:42,749
...is Manuela.

798
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,559
- Oh, no, not Manuela.
- No. Not Manuela. Oh, no.

799
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:49,030
- Please, not Manuela, reverend pirate.
- She's to be married to the mayor.

800
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,794
We have other girls, beautiful girls.

801
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,996
Suit yourself. But I warn you...

802
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,630
...if Manuela is not brought to me here
in 10 minutes, unmarried...

803
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,438
...I shall set torch to your town.

804
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,636
Your village will lie in ruins.

805
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,109
Your families will be scattered
to the winds.

806
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:09,511
Not one house shall be left standing,
not one stone upon another.

807
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,432
- No. No.
- Go fetch her.

808
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,073
- Where is Don Pedro? We must see him.
- You cannot see Don Pedro.

809
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,992
- He's not to be disturbed.
- I'm sorry.

810
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,230
This is a matter of life and death.

811
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,277
- Is that the padre?
- No, it's the advocate.

812
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,750
- Well, somebody get the padre.
- Don Pedro, I hardly know how to begin.

813
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,593
- It grieves me to bear this message.
- What is it? Speak up.

814
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,070
- Macoco has given us an ultimatum.
- Well, well?

815
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,152
Manuela is to be delivered to him
there within 10 minutes...

816
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:40,995
- <i>...or</i> he'll put a torch to the town.
- What? What?

817
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,397
The brazen effrontery.
The impertinence.

818
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:46,551
You think Macoco
wouldn't burn a town?

819
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,188
He's done it 100 times,
and with far less provocation.

820
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,157
Where is Manuela?
Let us speak to Manue...

821
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,197
You will not speak of this to Manuela.

822
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,271
Señora, lock the door
and give me the key.

823
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,668
It's ridiculous.

824
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,956
The whole thing is insane.

825
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:02,476
You go right back to him and tell him
that I refuse to be intimidated.

826
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,359
Perhaps you would like to go to Macoco
and tell him he's lying.

827
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,509
Yes.

828
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:08,796
That is... Well...

829
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,598
I tell you, he can't do anything.

830
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,557
He wouldn't dare.
He knows he'd hang.

831
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,759
Be realistic. You think threat of hanging
frightens him? He practically invites it.

832
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:20,237
He's admitted that he's the pirate
Macoco. For that alone he could hang.

833
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,039
- Right. You're perfectly right.
- This man fears nothing.

834
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,476
He knows there's a price on his head
and yet he boasts of his evil deeds.

835
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,632
He's a desperate character.
He should be killed like a dog.

836
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:30,789
Yes. He's ruthless.

837
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,439
We must do nothing to oppose him...

838
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:35,114
He's a menace
to the whole civilized world.

839
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,395
Inez, the key.

840
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,073
I'll be back within an hour.

841
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,593
Where are you going?

842
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,273
To the capital, to get the militia.

843
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:45,035
- Militia. Oh, no, Don Pedro.
- You're going to certain death.

844
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,111
Macoco's men
are surrounding the town.

845
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,555
- No one can get through.
- Don Pedro. Don Pedro.

846
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,597
We've wasted four minutes.

847
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,830
Let's go and talk to Manuela.

848
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,914
- Manuela.
- No, no, you're not to speak to her.

849
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:00,310
- I won't allow it.
- I'm sorry, señora.

850
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,630
Manuela. Manuela.

851
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,394
- Yes?
- Manuela, did you hear?

852
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:08,239
I couldn't help but hear a little.

853
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,790
It's a frightful thing to ask a young girl
to sacrifice herself...

854
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,076
...but no one and nothing else
can save us.

855
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,834
Manuela, don't listen to them.
Don Pedro has gone for help.

856
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,116
I'm sorry, señora.

857
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,592
Manuela, even if he could get through
the hills, which he can't, it's useless.

858
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,990
He cannot get back for an hour
at the very least...

859
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,752
<i>...and</i> we've only five minutes.

860
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,388
But you can't ask that of me.

861
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:34,269
You know I'd do anything
in this world to save you, anything.

862
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,032
But you can't ask that.

863
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:41,389
Manuela, we, your fellow townspeople,
are throwing ourselves on your mercy.

864
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:43,437
Will you go, Manuela?

865
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,320
Will you sacrifice yourself to save us?

866
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,234
But you're asking too much of me.

867
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,277
You'll go down in history, <i>Manuela...</i>

868
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,112
...another Joan of Arc...

869
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,192
...sacrificing herself
that her people might live.

870
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,157
But I've only just met him.

871
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:01,630
We'll put a tablet on your door,
Manuela Alva and this date.

872
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,872
Who knows, we might even change
the name of the town in honor of you.

873
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,632
Manuela, think of us,
of our wives...

874
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:09,394
...and our children,
the people you've known all your life.

875
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:12,393
Don't you see what this could mean
to my future?

876
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:15,757
It could mean the ruination
of my complete life.

877
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,480
Do you wanna see this town,
which our grandfathers built...

878
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,950
...over the years with such loving care,
do you want to see it ruined?

879
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:25,749
Razed, with not one stone left
upon another?

880
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,838
Thank you, Manuela.

881
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,753
Manuela,
all of our lives we'll thank you.

882
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,519
Thank you.

883
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,035
Manuela.

884
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,391
Manuela.

885
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,399
I can't bear
to have you sacrifice yourself.

886
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:14,835
I'll do it. I'll go in your place.

887
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,275
He asked for me.

888
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:22,040
Well, this is what you dreamed of,
isn't it?

889
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:23,789
I beg your pardon?

890
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:26,713
May I get you a cushion for your feet?

891
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,837
You... You... You said this
is what I've dreamed of.

892
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,878
Don't you remember? That's what
you said at the show that night.

893
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:37,713
You said you were in love with Macoco,
and that you dreamt...

894
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:41,509
<i>...that</i> someday he'd come
like a chicken hawk and carry you away.

895
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,676
I said that?

896
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,877
I said that to him?

897
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:49,314
Sure, to Serafin.

898
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:50,469
I mean...

899
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:53,398
Macoco.

900
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:56,154
Oh, yes, Macoco.

901
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,436
Would there be anything else,
Your Highness?

902
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:02,070
No, thank you.
I think that will be quite enough.

903
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:05,789
Well, then, if you'll excuse me,
I think I'Il...

904
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,115
Manuela, the time has come
to drop the mask.

905
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:39,918
Macoco.

906
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:47,277
Why did you think you had to do
all of these things to get me here?

907
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,159
Didn't you know you had only
to stretch out your hand?

908
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,675
No, please, don't move. Don't.

909
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,878
I want to gaze my full at you.

910
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:09,318
That sinister brow.

911
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:12,074
The hawk-like glance in your eyes.

912
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:16,472
Those savage shoulders.
The ferocious nape of that neck.

913
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,835
Oh, I can see you now in battle.

914
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,310
The clash of angry swords,
the roar of cannon and you...

915
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,278
You, Macoco, standing there,
with lightning breaking about you...

916
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,634
...dominating everything.

917
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,950
There's something
I must tell you. Look, l...

918
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:33,671
And to think I thought you were nothing
but a common actor.

919
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:39,596
How unspeakably drab.

920
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,989
- Just what was that you said?
- How could I have been so gullible?

921
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:50,118
I should have known from the
first moment I saw you on the stage...

922
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:53,352
...that you knew
absolutely nothing about acting.

923
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:56,518
- Now, look here...
- Oh, Macoco, my fabulous Macoco.

924
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,114
Take me away with you.
Take me away on your mighty ship.

925
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,111
- Just a minute. L...
- I can see us now.

926
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:05,956
You with you cutlass in one hand
and your... Your compass in the other...

927
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:08,680
...shouting orders to your pirate crew.

928
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:14,278
And I, I at your side, spurring you on
to greater and greater achievements.

929
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,874
Won't that be magnificent?

930
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:18,915
Tell me...

931
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,752
...just...

932
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:25,038
...what did you think was wrong
with my acting?

933
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:29,632
- Your what?
- My acting. You said you thought that l...

934
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:34,032
Oh, please, let's not talk of anything
so disgusting and degrading.

935
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,668
I despise actors.

936
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,114
Besides...

937
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:40,271
<i>...you</i> don't have to pretend with me.

938
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:42,396
I love you for what you are.

939
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,471
Ruthless and cruel.

940
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,359
Taking what you want,
fearing no one.

941
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,636
I don't think you saw a good show
that night.

942
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,279
My performance must have been off.

943
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,714
- Ordinarily, my...
- Oh, Macoco.

944
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,190
I could show you a review
in the <i>Trinidad Clarion</i> about my acting...

945
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:59,113
...comparing me with David Garrick.
Oh, I wish I had that here.

946
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,430
- I'd like to...
- The man I love, the man I love...

947
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:05,912
<i>...is</i> the man who said, "Bring Manuela
to me or I'll put a torch to the town."

948
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:07,957
- I have a confession to make...
- A confession?

949
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:09,712
You don't need to make a confession.

950
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:12,189
The record of your deeds
is written on my heart.

951
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:15,557
Oh, yes. One crime or two crimes
might be something to confess.

952
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:20,669
But crime on such a magnificent scale,
why, that becomes an epic.

953
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:26,949
You transcend the petty moral codes
of ordinary men.

954
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,712
Manuela, you must listen...

955
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:10,797
Manuela.

956
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,437
Oh, I see you found out.

957
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,589
Manuela.
Manuela, you're overwrought.

958
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:23,548
Now, I know you have every right
to be vexed. But I did it for us. Manu...

959
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,152
Manu...

960
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,959
Now, Manuela. Darling. Count to 10.

961
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,678
Manuela.

962
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,392
Now, Manuela.

963
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:35,913
Manuela.

964
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:40,073
Oil on the troubled waters, Manuela.
No. Your temper.

965
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:44,836
Oh, Manuela, this is ridiculous.
Don't be a witch. Manuela.

966
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,912
All right, Manuela.
I apologize. I apologize.

967
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:53,036
I shouldn't have walked that tightrope
to your room. I know that I should...

968
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:57,637
I realize I shouldn't have hypnotized you
and made you say those things. But...

969
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,712
Now, look. Manuela, I'm trying
to be reasonable. Can't you under...

970
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,714
can't you see I'm trying
to be big about this?

971
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:07,235
Manuela, I ask you. Please, do not...

972
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:12,516
Now, look, I've apologized abjectly.
What more can I do?

973
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,796
Just what more can l...

974
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:18,954
You're overdoing this.
You're being vindictive.

975
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:20,389
Now, you listen to me.

976
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,312
You have the manners
of a spoiled brat...

977
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,471
...and the effrontery
of an unbridled egotist.

978
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,596
Because I succumbed to your charm...

979
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:29,797
...don't think that I'll endure
your temperament, because I won't.

980
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:36,356
That settles it. I've never yet raised
my hand against a woman...

981
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:41,071
<i>...but</i> by heaven, you've gone too far.
En garde.

982
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:46,955
Touché.

983
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:52,549
Now, can't we talk this over
like sensible adult persons?

984
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,313
Now, Manu...

985
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:58,799
Now, don't...

986
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,154
Now, listen...

987
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,959
Manu... Oh, don't. Don't.
You'll hurt someone.

988
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,872
Serafin.

989
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:27,072
Serafin, my darling.

990
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:28,673
Serafin.

991
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:31,070
Serafin, what have I done to you?

992
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,512
What have I done to you?

993
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:35,398
What have I done?

994
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:37,357
Serafin?

995
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,759
Serafin, listen to me.

996
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:47,909
I didn't mean what I said
about your acting.

997
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:51,590
I think you're a wonderful actor.

998
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:58,233
Oh, darling, darling.

999
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:11,757
<i>You can do no wrong</i>

1000
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,348
<i>You're as right</i>

1001
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:21,277
<i>As the nightingale's song</i>

1002
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:27,112
<i>You're the nth of perfection</i>

1003
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:31,796
<i>Of them all you're the star</i>

1004
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:36,317
<i>When you gaze in my direction</i>

1005
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:41,713
<i>Life is caviar</i>

1006
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:51,829
<i>I can barely wait</i>

1007
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:57,908
<i>Till I know that we'll share</i>

1008
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:02,153
<i>The same fate</i>

1009
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:05,835
<i>And from then on</i>

1010
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,152
<i>Sweet angel</i>

1011
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:13,353
<i>I shall worship you</i>

1012
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:17,399
<i>My life long</i>

1013
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:24,272
<i>For you can do</i>

1014
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:30,676
<i>No wrong</i>

1015
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:36,514
<i>It's painfully true</i>

1016
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:42,158
<i>That you can do</i>

1017
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:47,348
<i>No wrong</i>

1018
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,717
To be able to send back word
that I've captured Macoco.

1019
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:01,677
The news will echo round the world.

1020
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,990
The king himself will call me back
to decorate me.

1021
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:05,354
I must warn you again, sir.

1022
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,432
Macoco is very clever. He will try
in every way to convince you...

1023
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:11,592
...that he is not a pirate.
- It is not necessary to give me advice.

1024
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,671
I am no novice in the affairs
of government.

1025
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,114
Sorry.

1026
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,159
Excellency, we have found a part
of his booty.

1027
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,038
What extraordinary luck.

1028
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:23,918
This is his personal chest.

1029
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:26,310
It's full of jewels stolen by Macoco.

1030
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:28,311
Do they tally
with the East India Company?

1031
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,152
Yes.
A great many of them, Excellency.

1032
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,276
The maharani's diamonds
and matched pearls.

1033
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:35,079
The Mogul's emeralds.
The stomacher of Marie Antoinette.

1034
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:37,674
- That's enough. Where is he?
- At the mayor's residence.

1035
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,400
Surround the place.
Guard every entrance, every window.

1036
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,551
Remember this man
is the devil incarnate.

1037
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:45,678
He'll strike like a cobra
when he realizes he's cornered.

1038
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,432
All right.

1039
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:02,037
Surround him, men.

1040
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:06,238
- Manuela. Are you all right?
- Yes.

1041
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,549
What have you done to her?

1042
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:09,995
Excellency, this is a joke, a silly joke.

1043
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:13,197
Just a silly joke. This man knew
that I had an admiration for Macoco.

1044
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,429
He pretended. That's all.

1045
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:16,511
You've been through
a terrible experience.

1046
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,352
But you have nothing to fear now.

1047
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:21,671
Your magnificent courage has earned
the gratitude of the entire island.

1048
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:24,400
It's due to you that this felon
has been apprehended.

1049
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,118
Captain.

1050
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:28,351
See the señorita escorted safely
to her home.

1051
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:30,119
No, l...

1052
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:37,074
Bring the prisoner here.

1053
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:43,751
Well, sir. At last.

1054
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,595
I can't tell you what pleasure it gives me
to meet you, under these conditions.

1055
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:48,749
Excellency.

1056
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:52,230
I must say, Macoco,
you're very satisfying.

1057
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,755
The other members of your profession,
whom I've <i>met...</i>

1058
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:57,309
...have looked more like bookkeepers
than pirates.

1059
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,118
But you.

1060
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:01,399
You fill the eye.

1061
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:04,154
Thank you. But I regret
to disillusion you, Excellency.

1062
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:07,869
I have been sailing under false colors.
I am not Macoco.

1063
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:11,635
My name is Serafin and I'm an actor.
Here are my papers.

1064
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,791
I warned you he'd do this,
don't believe him.

1065
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:18,152
Must I remind you I'm perfectly capable
of handling this without any assistance?

1066
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:19,435
Sorry.

1067
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,115
Did you really expect to fool me
with a forged passport?

1068
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:26,511
This means that some poor wretch
named Serafin is lying in a ditch...

1069
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,875
...somewhere
with a dagger in his throat.

1070
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:31,110
Don Pedro, do you think it wise
to go this far?

1071
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:32,919
I'm here to see that you hang.

1072
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,115
No doubt about that.

1073
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:36,953
But His Excellency would never
hang a man without evidence.

1074
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:38,951
Certainly not.

1075
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:42,277
Hey, wait a minute. What are you
doing with that? This is my prop box.

1076
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:45,989
I never allow anyone to touch this.
It holds all my professional secrets.

1077
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:49,200
Macoco, in the name of His Majesty
I hereby charge you...

1078
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:51,470
...with the murder of thousands
of his subjects.

1079
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:54,154
With theft, arson, et cetera, et cetera.

1080
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:58,033
Put him in irons and issue orders
to erect a gallows at once.

1081
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,714
We'll forego the formality of a trial.

1082
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:05,112
Don't take your eyes off him,
not for a minute. And don't let him talk.

1083
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:08,590
No, above all, don't let me talk.

1084
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,028
Let the execution begin.

1085
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,590
- Aunt Inez, let me through.
- You are behaving...

1086
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:29,793
Please, Aunt Inez. Let me through.
I've go to stop this. Stop. Stop!

1087
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:32,110
Your Excellency.
I beg you not to go on with this.

1088
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:34,475
- I implore you, don't...
- Señorita. You must calm...

1089
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,632
- Manuela.
- People. Listen, please.

1090
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:41,031
A few hours ago you thanked me
for saving your lives.

1091
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,475
You told me you'd be grateful forever.

1092
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:47,599
Well, now I have one favor
to ask of you in return.

1093
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:50,479
I beg you to stop this hanging.

1094
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,710
This man is not a pirate.

1095
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:56,395
He's only a strolling player, an actor.

1096
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,074
He's so good an actor
that you believed him...

1097
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:50,191
Proceed with the execution.

1098
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:54,474
Excellency.

1099
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:57,518
- May I speak?
- No. No. Go on with the hanging.

1100
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:01,714
Oh, I'm sorry. Should I have addressed
myself to the mayor?

1101
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:05,998
I had thought His Excellency,
the viceroy, was in command here.

1102
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:08,032
And so I am.

1103
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,038
You may have your say.

1104
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:14,509
Excellency, thank you.

1105
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:18,038
I wish to express my gratitude
to the señorita...

1106
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,077
...but she is wasting her sympathies.

1107
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:24,074
I agree with Don Pedro.
Macoco should hang.

1108
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:26,470
You're right.
For once you're telling the truth.

1109
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:28,596
Well, why are we waiting?

1110
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:29,829
Get on with the hanging.

1111
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,150
I shall try not to disappoint you.

1112
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:35,676
Your Excellency,
fate has been most kind to me.

1113
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:40,675
In my last moments it has granted me
the privilege of meeting, face to face...

1114
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,831
...one of the great figures of our time.

1115
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:46,475
Fate hasn't been unkind to me.

1116
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:51,077
It's always useful, politically, you know,
to capture an important criminal.

1117
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:55,279
I am only too happy, Excellency,
to further your career.

1118
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,670
And I to put an end to yours.

1119
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:00,873
I believe a condemned man
has a right to one last request.

1120
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:05,352
Well, within reason, a visit
from a loved one, a prayer, a beefsteak.

1121
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,397
I have only one burning desire.

1122
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:11,439
Let me give a performance, one
last performance for Your Excellency.

1123
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:14,151
Oh, that's impossible.

1124
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:17,876
If you escaped, I should have
to consider myself a fool.

1125
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,350
And I don't care to undervalue myself.

1126
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:23,796
Excellency, I have played
before the king of Spain...

1127
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:26,235
...the khedive of Egypt,
the bey of Tunis.

1128
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:29,836
I should like, before I die, to play
before Your Excellency.

1129
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,560
But you must see
it would be very irregular.

1130
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:34,309
Excellency...

1131
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:38,475
...you are a man of culture,
a man of imagination.

1132
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:41,279
When a royal banquet
is spread before you...

1133
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:44,238
...you do not pounce upon it
like any peasant.

1134
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:47,279
This is a great moment
we have before us.

1135
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:51,110
A moment in history.
Let's not rush at it.

1136
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:52,713
Let's savor it to the full.

1137
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:56,395
I never heard of such impudence,
such an outrage.

1138
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,437
Hang him. Hang him at once.

1139
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:00,875
You there, soldiers, go on, take him.

1140
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,792
Do you hear me?
Go on with the hanging.

1141
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,757
Just a minute, Don Pedro.

1142
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,717
Your Excellency, you don't know
this man.

1143
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,154
He's diabolically clever.

1144
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,550
He's trying to trick you,
make a fool of you.

1145
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:12,711
Excellency, I await your permission.

1146
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,632
No. No.

1147
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,756
I'm mayor here and I forbid it.

1148
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,638
Do you hear me? I forbid it.

1149
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,314
He hangs. He hangs this minute.

1150
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:22,833
Go on, hang him.

1151
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:27,551
You may be mayor of this little village,
but I am viceroy.

1152
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:30,799
You may give your show.

1153
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,031
Excellency.

1154
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:37,029
Stand back, men. Give the impresario
a little room.

1155
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:40,598
There's something rather perverse
about all this.

1156
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:46,153
I shall feel like a Roman emperor
of the Decadence. Rather agreeable.

1157
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:50,518
It will be a pleasure to be executed
by a man of such charm.

1158
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:01,033
Fellow artists.

1159
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:03,919
Overture. Prepare the proscenium.

1160
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:08,471
Unmask this funereal garb
and don the bright colors of Vespus.

1161
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:10,596
On with your costume, Trillo.

1162
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:13,832
- Trillo, strike up the music.
- What number will it be, captain?

1163
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,959
Our gayest and our best
to please our honored guest.

1164
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:19,713
Get the mirror ready.

1165
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:23,270
The mirror. I'm going to release
Don Pedro's spirit from its earthly bond.

1166
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:27,752
And now, ladies and gentlemen, honored
guest, in behalf of my little troupe...

1167
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,832
...may I hope that you enjoy
our farewell performance.

1168
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,719
Of course, this is not my first
farewell performance...

1169
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:37,759
...but I think we can trust
our honored guest to make it my last.

1170
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,999
Usually, for our opening
I perform a rope trick...

1171
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:45,836
...but tonight, under the circumstances,
I will skip the rope.

1172
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,880
Instead,
I and my two brilliant colleagues...

1173
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:52,157
...in the art of terpsichore
will entertain you.

1174
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:57,030
But first, if you will allow me,
I shall get away from this noose.

1175
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:02,238
As me mother used to say,
"No noose is good noose."

1176
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:05,912
<i>I'll remember forever</i>

1177
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:07,718
<i>When I was but 3

1178
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:09,871
<i>Mama, who was clever</i>

1179
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:11,712
<i>Remarking to me</i>

1180
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:14,155
<i>Son, when you've grown up</i>

1181
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,515
<i>And you want everything nice</i>

1182
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:20,078
<i>I've got your future sewn up</i>

1183
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:25,075
<i>If you'll take this advice</i>

1184
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,751
<i>Be a clown, be a clown</i>

1185
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:31,832
<i>All the world loves a clown</i>

1186
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,878
<i>Act the fool, play the calf</i>

1187
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:38,077
<i>And you'll always have the last laugh</i>

1188
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:41,232
<i>Wear the cap and the bells</i>

1189
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:44,710
<i>And you'll rate with all the great swells</i>

1190
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:47,758
<i>If you become a doctor,</i>
<i>Folks 'll face you with dread</i>

1191
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:50,798
<i>If you become a dentist</i>
<i>They'll be glad when you're dead</i>

1192
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,793
<i>You'll get a bigger hand</i>
<i>If you can stand on your head</i>

1193
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:57,270
<i>Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown</i>

1194
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:18,956
<i>Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown</i>

1195
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:56,711
<i>Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown</i>

1196
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:14,834
Oh, bravo. Bravo.

1197
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:33,671
Thank you. Thank you.

1198
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,671
That was merely an appetizer.

1199
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:39,595
Your Excellency, now we come
to the pinnacle of our entertainment...

1200
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:43,719
...an experiment in the new, sensational
science of animal magnetism...

1201
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:46,110
...taught me by the great
Mesmer himself.

1202
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:50,796
Oh, Mesmer. I knew him very well.
I was fascinated by his science.

1203
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:56,595
Then, of course, Your Excellency knows
the principles of the great Mesmer.

1204
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:58,432
In short...

1205
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,238
...hypnosis.

1206
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:03,712
Hypnosis.

1207
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,558
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
before your very eyes...

1208
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:10,676
...I shall perform this experiment.

1209
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:14,276
I shall need someone to help me,
but it must be the right person.

1210
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:17,637
Control cannot be exercised
over everyone.

1211
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:23,113
I have failed with the confused,
with the rebellious, with the recalcitrant.

1212
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:24,998
To perform the experiment ideally...

1213
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:29,472
...I must find a person whose character
and background are above reproach.

1214
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:35,477
I see we have a volunteer.

1215
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,636
We'll have none of that here,
young man.

1216
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:54,476
Señora, you have spoiled what promised
to be a very interesting experiment.

1217
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:56,949
Your Excellency, you do not realize.

1218
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:59,588
This man has powers that are...

1219
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:03,750
Quiet. Quiet. Stand back.
Don't speak to her.

1220
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:05,797
If you wake her, it may kill her.

1221
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:07,439
She's in a trance.

1222
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,037
Oh, Manuela, not again.

1223
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:15,589
Come, pure spirit. Come with me.

1224
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:18,593
- I forbid it. It's a disgrace.
- Sit down, Don Pedro.

1225
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:20,557
Gracious lady, if you have any wish...

1226
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:24,872
...express it freely to me.
I who am your friend.

1227
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:27,915
- I wish th...
- Yes?

1228
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,719
- I wish...
- Black magic.

1229
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:32,474
I won't have him practice black magic
on my future wife.

1230
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:34,870
- It's an outrage.
- Hold your tongue, Don Pedro.

1231
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:37,838
I will not have this performance ruined
by your possessiveness.

1232
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,310
Excellency, will you please tell him
this is not flirtation, it is science?

1233
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:43,357
- It is science.
- Whatever. I don't like it.

1234
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:47,593
I demand that you hold your tongue.
Proceed, sir, with your mesmerism.

1235
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:54,955
Manuela, are you afraid?

1236
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:56,314
No, no.

1237
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:00,075
What is your wish, Manuela?
What is your wish?

1238
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:02,435
I ask for very little...

1239
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:04,477
...only to be allowed...

1240
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:06,790
...to worship at your feet, Macoco.

1241
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:09,236
My prince of pirates.

1242
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:13,109
Let them do with you what they will.
It makes no difference.

1243
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:16,716
Your spirit and your legend
will live on through the ages.

1244
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:23,471
Oh, I worship you for your immortal
deeds, your fearlessness, your daring.

1245
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:24,914
Destiny has been harsh.

1246
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:28,595
It has given me the vision of you,
only to snatch it away...

1247
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:34,312
...but I shall carry your image
in my heart, cherishing it, loving it.

1248
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:37,950
I shall dedicate my life
to the memory of you.

1249
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:41,908
But, Manuela, you are to be married
to Don Pedro, the most pious...

1250
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:46,358
...the most upright...
- The most piddling of all men.

1251
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:50,991
A namby-pamby who dares not leave
this village...

1252
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:55,358
<i>...a</i> catchpenny who's afraid
even of the sea.

1253
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:57,471
Oh, but you, Macoco.

1254
01:30:57,640 --> 01:31:00,074
You, you have slashed across
this world...

1255
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:03,277
...your bold pattern of imagination.

1256
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:07,599
You are a glorious prism
that dazzles me...

1257
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:09,796
...with all of its facets.

1258
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:18,309
<i>Love of my life</i>

1259
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:23,275
<i>Life of my love</i>

1260
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:26,557
<i>I used to pray</i>

1261
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:33,193
<i>And pray you'd hear me</i>

1262
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:37,399
<i>Love of my life</i>

1263
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:42,477
<i>Angels above</i>

1264
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:46,155
<i>Sent you at last</i>

1265
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:52,873
<i>To stay always near me</i>

1266
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:59,752
<i>Now we are one</i>

1267
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:05,998
<i>Never to part</i>

1268
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:09,277
<i>And nevermore</i>

1269
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:14,514
<i>Need I implore you</i>

1270
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:19,310
<i>To miss me</i>

1271
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:25,757
<i>Come to my arms</i>

1272
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:30,512
<i>Come to my heart</i>

1273
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:34,318
<i>Kiss me</i>

1274
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:40,278
<i>Kiss me</i>

1275
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:43,876
<i>Come to me</i>

1276
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:47,794
<i>Come to me</i>

1277
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:56,197
<i>Love of my life</i>

1278
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:19,997
Macoco!

1279
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:23,673
I've had enough of this.

1280
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:28,868
This marionette, strutting around
pretending to be the Black Macoco.

1281
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:32,077
Do you think a runt like that
could handle a crew of cutthroats?

1282
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:35,949
Do you think real men would risk
their necks to serve under him?

1283
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:40,318
If you want to worship Macoco,
then worship me.

1284
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,994
It was I who was the terror
of the Caribbean.

1285
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:46,436
The most feared and hated man
who ever sailed a ship.

1286
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:48,238
At the mere mention of my name...

1287
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:51,756
...armed fleets would slink
into their harbors.

1288
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:55,310
Whole populations would flee
to the hills...

1289
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:57,835
...when my ship
came in sight of land...

1290
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,993
...my name was like thunder,
rolling in from the sea.

1291
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:04,913
I am this man you worship.

1292
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:07,310
I am Macoco.

1293
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:10,191
Not this greasepaint hero.

1294
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:14,592
This puny, rabbit-hearted,
white-livered buffoon.

1295
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:18,230
I am Macoco.

1296
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:29,473
Ladies and gentlemen, don't move,
don't stir, the best is still to come.

1297
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:32,552
We have a new star
in our brilliant galaxy of players...

1298
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:37,396
...the beautiful, the beguiling,
the divine Manuela.

1299
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:52,078
<i>Be a clown, be a clown</i>

1300
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:54,959
<i>All the world loves a clown</i>

1301
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:56,553
<i>Show 'em tricks</i>

1302
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:58,073
<i>Tell 'em jokes</i>

1303
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:00,959
<i>And you'll only stop with top folks</i>

1304
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:04,112
<i>Dress in huge, baggy pants</i>

1305
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:07,431
<i>And you'll ride the road to romance</i>

1306
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:10,398
<i>A butcher or a baker</i>
<i>Ladies never embrace</i>

1307
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:13,472
<i>A barber for a beau</i>
<i>Would be a social disgrace</i>

1308
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:16,393
<i>They all'll come to call</i>
<i>If you can fall on your face</i>

1309
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:20,712
<i>Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown</i>

1310
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:31,592
<i>Be a clown, be a clown</i>

1311

<i>All the world loves a clown</i>

1312
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:37,798
<i>Be a crazy buffoon</i>

1313
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:40,872
<i>And the demoiselles 'll all swoon</i>

1314
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:43,838
<i>Be a crack jackanapes</i>

1315
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,878
<i>And they'll imitate you like apes</i>

1316
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:50,273
<i>Why be a great composer</i>
<i>With your rent in arrears?</i>

1317
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:53,352
<i>Why be a major poet</i>
<i>And you'll owe it for years</i>

1318
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:56,193
<i>When crowds 'll pay to giggle</i>
<i>If you wiggle your ears?</i>

<i>And you'll always travel first class</i>

1324
