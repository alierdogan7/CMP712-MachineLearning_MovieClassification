1
00:00:05,544 --> 00:00:06,522
My name is Vinod.

2
00:00:08,714 --> 00:00:10,455
I'm very happy here.

3
00:00:13,052 --> 00:00:15,931
This is our world.
A peaceful world.

4
00:01:01,267 --> 00:01:02,245
Children!

5
00:01:03,436 --> 00:01:08,909
Tamil Nadu people have collected these &
sent them for you.

6
00:01:09,108 --> 00:01:12,248
Don't fret about these
being second hand.

7
00:01:12,445 --> 00:01:16,484
This is their love
and mercy on you.

8
00:01:16,615 --> 00:01:21,758
Let's pray for 2 minutes for the welfare
of all those benevolent souls.

9
00:01:25,124 --> 00:01:29,095
No need of 2 minutes.
...at least 50 seconds.

10
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:32,109
No...at least 20 seconds...

11
00:01:32,798 --> 00:01:33,776
Dear children!

12
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:46,949
They're just uncontrollable.

13
00:01:47,146 --> 00:01:48,887
Father, letter for you.

14
00:01:53,652 --> 00:01:57,964
My son...my son.

15
00:01:58,157 --> 00:01:59,966
After a long time I got
myself a pant.

16
00:02:00,059 --> 00:02:01,265
Give it...give it.

17
00:02:04,163 --> 00:02:04,834
Give it...

18
00:02:09,368 --> 00:02:11,348
Will you give me or not?

19
00:02:14,507 --> 00:02:16,043
Hey...

20
00:02:28,187 --> 00:02:31,259
Hey, you've got a letter.
University of Madras.

21
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:33,670
You've got a seat
to study B.E.,

22
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:34,837
Special quota!

23
00:02:37,029 --> 00:02:39,066
I never applied.
- I did.

24
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,850
Vinod B.E., Engineer.

25
00:02:47,206 --> 00:02:48,344
How thrilling it is to hear!

26
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,680
I can't go, father.
- Why?

27
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:54,520
I can't live without you, father.

28
00:02:55,548 --> 00:02:57,186
This time you can't escape.

29
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,689
What did I tell you when you
were studying in 8th class?

30
00:02:59,885 --> 00:03:02,024
This school isn't good enough
for your intellect.

31
00:03:02,221 --> 00:03:04,030
When I said I'll get you
admitted in a good school,

32
00:03:04,223 --> 00:03:08,035
you said, you'll go after
finishing S.S.L.C.,

33
00:03:08,227 --> 00:03:09,638
after finishing S.S.L.C.,

34
00:03:09,895 --> 00:03:12,876
Father, will it not be good if I
go after finishing plus 2,

35
00:03:13,065 --> 00:03:14,043
you told me.

36
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:18,709
You've finished plus 2 now.
You can't study further here.

37
00:03:18,904 --> 00:03:20,042
You must go out from here.

38
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,049
You've a train tonight.
Get ready by evening.

39
00:03:23,242 --> 00:03:25,222
Father, have you decided to
chase me out from here?

40
00:03:25,578 --> 00:03:27,319
I'm asking you to go out
for a better life.

41
00:03:27,746 --> 00:03:32,718
Do you want to spend your life sewing
food to children & me.

42
00:03:32,918 --> 00:03:34,397
You've been living here
for years.

43
00:03:34,587 --> 00:03:37,796
Did you ever step out of
this forest even once?

44
00:03:38,257 --> 00:03:39,065
Mad boy!

45
00:03:39,258 --> 00:03:40,566
World is very large.

46
00:03:40,926 --> 00:03:41,802
Go out boy!

47
00:04:29,475 --> 00:04:32,718
I reached the place I despised.

48
00:04:37,116 --> 00:04:42,116
<i>TAMILINI</i>

49
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:25,668
What ever you see at 18,
cross the limits to enjoy it.

50
00:05:27,032 --> 00:05:32,846
A boatman's life is restricted to the sea.
Learn to live beyond the waves.

51
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:37,509
The other name of happiness is woman.

52
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,850
Won't all desires lead to her?

53
00:05:41,046 --> 00:05:48,191
Isn't Manhood's duty to make
womanhood go ecstatic?

54
00:06:02,735 --> 00:06:07,735
<i>TAMILINI</i>

55
00:06:38,771 --> 00:06:41,911
On the beach road when intoxication
is slowly enveloping you,

56
00:06:42,107 --> 00:06:44,747
there's no difference
between men & women.

57
00:06:46,111 --> 00:06:49,422
Touching at sensuous places,
getting all fired up,

58
00:06:49,615 --> 00:06:51,754
there's no end to fun.

59
00:06:52,985 --> 00:06:56,330
Who's she? Biting me
with her teeth.

60
00:06:56,455 --> 00:06:59,925
Don't know where I had her?

61
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:03,766
Is it culture?
Fast modernizing country?

62
00:07:03,996 --> 00:07:07,307
Burn down the people
who criticize this.

63
00:07:22,815 --> 00:07:27,815
<i>TAMILINI</i>

64
00:08:09,995 --> 00:08:14,740
Seeing me & expressing love to me.
Oh God! you'll say, I'm your brother.

65
00:08:15,701 --> 00:08:18,841
Pinching my head,
pushing me aside when I cry,

66
00:08:19,037 --> 00:08:21,415
You'll fly away to live
in America.

67
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:26,015
Love is nothing but
taking few lives.

68
00:08:26,211 --> 00:08:29,021
Tears will not help you in love.

69
00:08:29,548 --> 00:08:33,189
Your head is with me here,
your body is with him there.

70
00:08:33,552 --> 00:08:37,193
If it happens,
whafll you be called as?

71
00:09:25,938 --> 00:09:27,246
Sir, can I get any job here?

72
00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:29,578
Go & stand in the queue.
- Okay sir.

73
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:48,498
Hey, what's this, man?

74
00:09:49,628 --> 00:09:51,938
Buddy, we must do something
silly like this.

75
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,609
Only then girls
will notice us.

76
00:09:58,136 --> 00:09:59,171
Hi, Babe!

77
00:10:00,138 --> 00:10:01,276
Great chic!

78
00:10:03,642 --> 00:10:05,622
They've admitted you in this collage,

79
00:10:05,978 --> 00:10:08,117
every Tom, Dick & Harry
is joining college now.

80
00:10:08,313 --> 00:10:09,451
A rogue like you...

81
00:10:11,316 --> 00:10:12,454
A useless person like me.

82
00:10:12,985 --> 00:10:14,123
Every one is joining college.

83
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:15,457
Don't know what the hell
you're going to do here.

84
00:10:15,654 --> 00:10:16,860
Hey, go man.

85
00:10:18,824 --> 00:10:21,202
That's it...that's it.
That's a great butt.

86
00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:24,807
How's that?

87
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,138
Oh my God!

88
00:10:26,331 --> 00:10:28,811
You were here just a moment back.
Changed the costume so quickly.

89
00:10:29,835 --> 00:10:32,645
We must be very
careful now a days.

90
00:10:33,338 --> 00:10:35,147
Or else some one else will
fly away with your girl friend.

91
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,321
That's why, I've a ready to
exchange set-up in hand.

92
00:10:38,677 --> 00:10:40,486
If I go in this dress I'll not be
allowed in the class room.

93
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:42,488
So, this is for inside
the class room,

94
00:10:42,681 --> 00:10:43,819
this is for outside
the class room.

95
00:10:44,016 --> 00:10:47,486
Inside - Outside.

96
00:10:47,686 --> 00:10:50,428
Adi, leave it.
Listen to me.

97
00:10:50,856 --> 00:10:52,893
This is not our area to create
trouble & go soot free.

98
00:10:53,358 --> 00:10:54,428
Don't get beaten up
unnecessarily.

99
00:10:55,027 --> 00:10:57,166
What?" Get beaten up"!

100
00:10:57,863 --> 00:11:00,901
You mean slapped on the cheek,
beaten up with slippers, etc.,

101
00:11:05,037 --> 00:11:07,847
That was done in our
grandparent's time.

102
00:11:08,373 --> 00:11:11,684
Now, if you observe a girl keenly
for 5 minutes,

103
00:11:11,877 --> 00:11:14,357
they'll come and
propose marriage.

104
00:11:16,048 --> 00:11:16,856
Watch now.

105
00:11:24,723 --> 00:11:25,258
WOW!

106
00:11:27,225 --> 00:11:28,704
Sorry.- It's okay.

107
00:11:36,068 --> 00:11:37,206
Hello! What happened?

108
00:11:38,403 --> 00:11:38,881
Hello!

109
00:11:40,238 --> 00:11:41,876
Is it a dream?

110
00:11:43,742 --> 00:11:44,812
Hey, what are you doing?

111
00:11:47,746 --> 00:11:49,384
This is not a dream.

112
00:11:50,082 --> 00:11:51,493
Is it paining?- No.

113
00:11:55,921 --> 00:11:57,161
Do you want to say anything else?

114
00:11:58,423 --> 00:11:59,561
Do you want to say anything else?

115
00:11:59,758 --> 00:12:01,237
We can meet in the canteen
this afternoon.

116
00:12:01,426 --> 00:12:02,404
Afternoon?

117
00:12:02,761 --> 00:12:05,503
How can I live without
seeing you till then?

118
00:12:06,765 --> 00:12:07,641
naughty-

119
00:12:14,106 --> 00:12:16,586
Didn't I tell you trapping
girls is very easy?

120
00:12:17,776 --> 00:12:20,985
Don't know why girls fall on me...

121
00:12:27,786 --> 00:12:28,764
Rascal!

122
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:35,931
Why are girls "falling" on you?

123
00:12:37,963 --> 00:12:42,673
Oh my God! What a great chic!
What a structure!

124
00:12:46,304 --> 00:12:51,276
God! If she has a lover already,
he must die today in an accident.

125
00:12:51,476 --> 00:12:53,456
If there's anyone to marry her,
he must die tomorrow.

126
00:12:53,645 --> 00:12:54,350
Oh my God!

127
00:13:08,827 --> 00:13:09,305
Oh my God!

128
00:13:10,328 --> 00:13:12,638
Useless...idiot...bloody pig.

129
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,639
Where are you looking
while walking on road?

130
00:13:13,832 --> 00:13:16,813
Are you ogling girls
while walking on road?

131
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:18,306
Buffalo!

132
00:13:18,837 --> 00:13:20,248
Oh, he has dented my auto.

133
00:13:21,173 --> 00:13:22,709
You've made a dent.

134
00:13:23,175 --> 00:13:26,713
How much money do you've?
Come on take out.

135
00:13:27,512 --> 00:13:29,822
Don't you've any thing?

136
00:13:30,015 --> 00:13:32,825
Where are you working?

137
00:13:33,185 --> 00:13:33,663
Come.

138
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:35,520
Dear students,

139
00:13:36,188 --> 00:13:39,101
You know very well how
your parents would feel...

140
00:13:39,524 --> 00:13:40,594
What? Do you've a play boy?

141
00:13:41,526 --> 00:13:43,335
Adi, hereafter they're our friends.

142
00:13:43,528 --> 00:13:46,168
Arun, Abbas...this is Ramesh.
- Hi buddy!

143
00:13:46,364 --> 00:13:47,001
Yes, sir.

144
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:49,273
Hey!

145
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:52,677
Sir...doubt...- Yes.

146
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,016
It's okay, sir.

147
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,680
Is he a good student?- He?

148
00:14:02,047 --> 00:14:04,288
Yes. He'll study well about girls.

149
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:05,186
Ask him now.

150
00:14:05,383 --> 00:14:09,092
He'll tell the color of her nail polish
and her waist measurement correctly.

151
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:11,196
Did you ever see anyone
ogling girls like him?

152
00:14:11,556 --> 00:14:14,765
Look at the responsibility
writ large on his face.

153
00:14:15,227 --> 00:14:16,365
What an intelligent face!

154
00:14:16,561 --> 00:14:18,871
Hey, why're you talking and
disturbing the class?

155
00:14:19,231 --> 00:14:21,541
Are you coming to college
to study or to talk?

156
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,311
Just think,

157
00:14:24,569 --> 00:14:27,311
how our parents are struggling
to educate us.

158
00:14:27,739 --> 00:14:30,777
If not for yourself at least
study well for the sake of your parents.

159
00:14:31,743 --> 00:14:34,553
First pay attention to the lecture.
You too boys.

160
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,889
Move. Class is full of criminals.

161
00:14:42,254 --> 00:14:44,734
So that you can have a
wide knowledge,

162
00:14:44,923 --> 00:14:45,731
concerning the subject.

163
00:14:45,924 --> 00:14:46,561
So...

164
00:14:49,261 --> 00:14:51,002
Who are you?
What do you want?

165
00:15:03,942 --> 00:15:05,080
Are you a student?

166
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:07,586
What's your name?

167
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,760
Vinod - What? - Vinod.

168
00:15:11,283 --> 00:15:15,356
Shouldn't you take permission
before entering the class?

169
00:15:18,456 --> 00:15:18,934
Go.

170
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:23,163
God! Don't know from where
such creatures come here?

171
00:15:24,296 --> 00:15:26,367
They're entering college
under some quota.

172
00:15:26,631 --> 00:15:29,168
I'm fated to teach
such students.

173
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,861
Hey, look there! Divya!

174
00:17:03,561 --> 00:17:04,596
Our classmate.

175
00:17:05,063 --> 00:17:08,875
Look, she's coming
wherever I'm standing.

176
00:17:09,401 --> 00:17:11,210
We are meeting quite often today.

177
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:12,946
What do you understand from this?

178
00:17:13,405 --> 00:17:16,818
Don't you see we've a connection
from our previous birth?

179
00:17:18,076 --> 00:17:19,714
Both are studying in
the same college,

180
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:20,889
same class.

181
00:17:21,246 --> 00:17:22,486
Where else she can go?

182
00:17:22,914 --> 00:17:24,291
It seems she's coming
where ever he is.

183
00:17:27,085 --> 00:17:27,722
Hey!

184
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:28,556
Sky!

185
00:17:29,587 --> 00:17:31,225
Sky's color is blue.
- Has he gone mad?

186
00:17:31,423 --> 00:17:34,734
Moon!...is round...your face.

187
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:35,738
Flower!

188
00:17:35,927 --> 00:17:38,908
Please don't get scared.
Boy is trying his hand at poetry.

189
00:17:39,097 --> 00:17:40,576
I'm not able to
understand one thing.

190
00:17:40,765 --> 00:17:44,235
If you see a beautiful girl,
you'll start blabbering sky, moon, earth.

191
00:17:44,436 --> 00:17:45,915
Haven't you seen all these earlier?

192
00:17:46,104 --> 00:17:47,515
Are you seeing them for
the first time now?

193
00:17:48,773 --> 00:17:51,083
Why're you staring
at her only, Adi?

194
00:17:51,276 --> 00:17:54,257
If I stare at her
it means, she's mine.

195
00:17:54,446 --> 00:17:55,925
Adi...no.

196
00:17:56,114 --> 00:17:57,923
I feel she's a different
type of girl.

197
00:17:58,116 --> 00:17:59,254
She's going to insult you.

198
00:17:59,451 --> 00:18:01,590
Hey, what different type of girl!

199
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:03,322
High class.

200
00:18:03,621 --> 00:18:04,429
That is...

201
00:18:04,622 --> 00:18:05,930
Two cars will be parked
in front of her house,

202
00:18:06,124 --> 00:18:08,104
our house will be of car size only.

203
00:18:08,293 --> 00:18:09,772
They'll spend 5 to 6 thousand
rupees everyday,

204
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:11,338
your father's monthly salary is
that much.

205
00:18:11,629 --> 00:18:13,108
She'll be having credit cards
in her bag,

206
00:18:13,298 --> 00:18:14,936
we don't have even
a visiting card.

207
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:16,942
They'll go to shop
in Alsa Mall & Spencers,

208
00:18:17,135 --> 00:18:18,773
We'll not be allowed to even enter there.

209
00:18:19,137 --> 00:18:20,616
She'll be having a cell phone,

210
00:18:20,805 --> 00:18:22,284
we don't have even a landline phone
in our house.

211
00:18:22,474 --> 00:18:23,953
If we go near her, her perfume smell
will hit us,

212
00:18:24,142 --> 00:18:25,678
we'll stink with sweat smell.

213
00:18:25,977 --> 00:18:28,617
They'll never speak Tamil
and you can't speak English.

214
00:18:28,813 --> 00:18:31,692
That's 1+1=2+3=5, high class.

215
00:18:32,317 --> 00:18:34,456
They will feel disgusted
even to see us.

216
00:18:35,153 --> 00:18:37,793
Hey, enough buddy.

217
00:18:38,823 --> 00:18:42,464
How many girls I've met in
my illustrious career.

218
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,970
Watch. I'll trap her today.

219
00:18:45,163 --> 00:18:46,972
No...no Professor says,
Malhotra is the best.

220
00:18:47,165 --> 00:18:49,577
Hi Divya! Isn't your name Divya?

221
00:18:50,001 --> 00:18:50,979
My name is Adi.

222
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:53,979
Hi...hi.- Hi...- Hi.

223
00:18:54,172 --> 00:18:56,812
I'm your classmate.
Divya, sweet name.

224
00:18:57,675 --> 00:18:58,710
This dress looks very good on you.

225
00:18:59,177 --> 00:19:00,918
Then, you all...
- What do you want?

226
00:19:01,513 --> 00:19:02,924
No...just like that.

227
00:19:03,181 --> 00:19:05,593
You were discussing something,
I thought I'll also join you.

228
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:06,726
What's this?

229
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:08,930
I don't think, this is right.

230
00:19:09,687 --> 00:19:11,997
You're interrupting
our discussion.

231
00:19:12,524 --> 00:19:13,935
Don't you've some manners?

232
00:19:14,526 --> 00:19:17,996
First as a B.E. student,
first try to behave in a decent way.

233
00:19:18,863 --> 00:19:20,934
Do you understand that?
Now quit.

234
00:19:25,036 --> 00:19:27,175
Then, where shall
we've our lunch?

235
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:29,412
In canteen or shall we
go out somewhere?

236
00:19:33,044 --> 00:19:36,355
I spoke to her. She said,
"we'll meet later & discuss".

237
00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:37,754
Okay...okay.

238
00:19:39,551 --> 00:19:41,030
Just now I had a close
look at her.

239
00:19:42,053 --> 00:19:42,963
She doesn't have a structure.

240
00:19:43,555 --> 00:19:45,865
Look at her face. Flat nose.

241
00:19:46,057 --> 00:19:48,094
Small eyes. Decayed tooth.

242
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:51,035
Buddy, do you call her a chic?

243
00:19:51,729 --> 00:19:53,367
Will anyone try for her?

244
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,708
Cool down, buddy.

245
00:19:56,901 --> 00:19:59,711
You had said you'll trap her
today itself.

246
00:19:59,904 --> 00:20:01,713
You are not able to
even speak to her.

247
00:20:01,906 --> 00:20:02,441
What do you want now?

248
00:20:02,907 --> 00:20:04,887
She must talk to me,
that's all, isn't it?

249
00:20:05,076 --> 00:20:06,555
Talking to you is very
simple, buddy.

250
00:20:06,744 --> 00:20:09,224
You don't know how to approach her.
Shall I try?

251
00:20:09,414 --> 00:20:10,893
What do you want him
to do now?

252
00:20:11,082 --> 00:20:12,060
You don't know about him.

253
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,230
He'll do anything you tell him.
What's the bet?

254
00:20:15,253 --> 00:20:18,063
Okay. We know her character now.

255
00:20:18,256 --> 00:20:22,068
Adi must kiss her.
If he does it now,

256
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,399
I'll buy drinks for
next 10 days,

257
00:20:24,596 --> 00:20:26,075
with side dish, okay?

258
00:20:26,264 --> 00:20:27,902
What? Drinks for 10 days!

259
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:31,410
Adi, please do it. Buddy...please go.
- What's it?

260
00:20:33,271 --> 00:20:34,579
Kiss?- Yes.

261
00:20:35,273 --> 00:20:36,752
That girl!- Yes.

262
00:20:52,957 --> 00:20:54,766
This is cheating.
- What's cheating in this?

263
00:20:54,959 --> 00:20:56,597
I can also kiss like this.

264
00:20:57,629 --> 00:20:59,108
Come on do it, let me see.

265
00:20:59,297 --> 00:21:01,368
Give...give man...- Give.

266
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,780
Wow! Rs.400.

267
00:21:04,969 --> 00:21:08,781
Buddy, drinks for 10 days.
Thanks buddy, thanks.

268
00:21:08,973 --> 00:21:11,783
Tell me, do you want me to
kiss any where else?

269
00:21:11,976 --> 00:21:13,114
Shall I give a lip to lip kiss now?

270
00:21:13,311 --> 00:21:14,119
What's the bet?

271
00:21:14,312 --> 00:21:15,950
Bet?...- Your bike?

272
00:21:16,481 --> 00:21:17,960
Buddy, you're very brave.

273
00:21:19,484 --> 00:21:21,293
Buddy, you need to master the
technique for that.

274
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,300
She'll definitely know someone
has kissed her.

275
00:21:24,489 --> 00:21:27,095
But, can she find the man
who kissed her?

276
00:21:27,325 --> 00:21:29,305
How coolly I escaped.

277
00:21:29,827 --> 00:21:32,467
I must admit, I don't know
what perfume she uses...

278
00:21:32,664 --> 00:21:33,734
Rose smell...

279
00:22:08,032 --> 00:22:10,672
Bloody fool! Didn't I tell you
to serve after one hour?

280
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:12,848
Go away.

281
00:22:15,206 --> 00:22:19,780
Yuck! Bloody idiot.
- Okay, leave him.

282
00:22:26,551 --> 00:22:29,464
Listen to me...Leave me.
Enough..it's raining.

283
00:22:33,057 --> 00:22:35,697
Go...nothing to be afraid of...go.
Go, nothing will happen...go.

284
00:22:35,893 --> 00:22:38,203
It'll get over in few minutes...
go, listen to me...go.

285
00:22:38,396 --> 00:22:39,704
Go...inside...
Nothing will happen. Go.

286
00:22:40,231 --> 00:22:43,542
Father, didn't I tell you, that
I'll not go out from there?

287
00:22:43,735 --> 00:22:45,612
Did you listen to me?
Now look what has happened?

288
00:22:46,738 --> 00:22:47,546
What happened son?

289
00:22:48,072 --> 00:22:50,552
This is disgusting, father.

290
00:22:51,075 --> 00:22:52,713
I can't live in this
disgusting world.

291
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,947
I'll come back, father.
Please father.

292
00:22:55,413 --> 00:22:56,824
I beg you, father.

293
00:22:57,749 --> 00:23:00,389
Father...father... father,
I've a bus to that place now.

294
00:23:01,252 --> 00:23:03,562
If I don't get it, I'll come there
at least in a lorry, father.

295
00:23:04,756 --> 00:23:06,565
I'll be there with you by
tomorrow morning 7 a.m.

296
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:10,231
Vinod, you must
have determination.

297
00:23:10,762 --> 00:23:12,901
You must have determination
to come out successful.

298
00:23:13,264 --> 00:23:18,077
If you jump in the fire and
complain of burning,

299
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:19,976
you'll be reduced to ashes.

300
00:23:20,438 --> 00:23:21,246
Come whatever may in your path,

301
00:23:21,439 --> 00:23:23,919
kick it aside and go
surging ahead. Go ahead.

302
00:23:24,108 --> 00:23:26,179
Hey, come here and see man,
you'll understand.

303
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,418
He stops respecting at
the drop of the hat.

304
00:23:32,116 --> 00:23:34,255
Okay, I'm coming boy.

305
00:23:35,286 --> 00:23:37,857
I'll come after 6 months.

306
00:23:38,456 --> 00:23:41,665
If you still find it as disgusting
as you're saying now,

307
00:23:42,293 --> 00:23:44,933
we've this orphanage, church.,
I'll bring you back here.

308
00:23:45,129 --> 00:23:47,609
Father...father...- Till then, stay
there only. I'm hanging the phone. the call.

309
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:53,272
Father...father...
I'll come back, father.

310
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,120
Students, this problem
is very difficult.

311
00:23:58,476 --> 00:23:59,955
But, very important
for examination.

312
00:24:00,311 --> 00:24:03,622
Don't get scared seeing this.
Try to understand.

313
00:24:05,316 --> 00:24:08,627
Now, we'll solve it step by step.

314
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,798
If you don't understand
this problem,

315
00:24:09,987 --> 00:24:11,796
I'll solve this problem again
in the next class, okay.

316
00:24:11,989 --> 00:24:13,559
You can clarify your doubts...Okay?

317
00:24:14,826 --> 00:24:16,362
Divya, divergence theorem.

318
00:24:19,497 --> 00:24:20,305
Good, sit down.

319
00:24:21,499 --> 00:24:22,978
Step 2. Adikesavan!

320
00:24:30,007 --> 00:24:30,508
What?

321
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,045
Do you know or not?

322
00:24:35,847 --> 00:24:37,485
Get out.- Sir...

323
00:24:37,682 --> 00:24:39,252
Why're you sitting here without
even knowing this?

324
00:24:39,517 --> 00:24:40,154
Get out.

325
00:24:41,185 --> 00:24:42,994
Please don't come to my class
to while away time.

326
00:24:43,521 --> 00:24:46,263
I tell you, I don't want such
students in my class.

327
00:24:46,858 --> 00:24:47,336
Out!

328
00:24:47,525 --> 00:24:49,835
Laughing at me.
I'll take you to task for it.

329
00:24:50,027 --> 00:24:51,335
Step 2. Senthil Kumar.

330
00:24:54,532 --> 00:24:55,670
Wait...

331
00:25:04,542 --> 00:25:05,350
Wake him up.

332
00:25:19,891 --> 00:25:22,030
Hello! What are you doing?

333
00:25:22,894 --> 00:25:25,534
I'm asking you.
What are you doing?

334
00:25:25,897 --> 00:25:27,205
Do you know what's all that?

335
00:25:28,065 --> 00:25:29,544
Do you know
what non sense is all that?

336
00:25:30,234 --> 00:25:32,043
Some one will offer you
a free seat.

337
00:25:32,236 --> 00:25:33,044
They'll feed you
with free meals.

338
00:25:33,237 --> 00:25:35,046
Will you sleep here after
having free meals?

339
00:25:35,573 --> 00:25:38,452
Yuck! Aren't you ashamed?
How dare you sleep in my class?

340
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:41,891
Look there! What's that?
That's a problem.

341
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,786
Have you ever seen it before?

342
00:25:44,415 --> 00:25:46,053
Do you at least know to read it?

343
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,231
Take it...go & solve it.
Go...go boy.

344
00:25:49,587 --> 00:25:51,726
I know you're a good
for nothing boy.

345
00:25:51,923 --> 00:25:53,561
Go and stand there at least
like a broom stick.

346
00:25:53,925 --> 00:25:56,735
Students! I'm highly disappointed
with this class.

347
00:25:57,595 --> 00:26:00,075
Do you know how brilliant engineering
students are in other colleges?

348
00:26:00,598 --> 00:26:02,475
I took 2 days to prepare
for this problem.

349
00:26:02,767 --> 00:26:04,246
I had referred 6 books...

350
00:26:04,602 --> 00:26:07,913
Hey, he's solving the problem.
- He has done it.

351
00:26:08,105 --> 00:26:09,243
How painful it is for me!

352
00:26:09,941 --> 00:26:10,419
What?

353
00:26:39,136 --> 00:26:41,616
He's correct.
Please take it down.

354
00:26:49,981 --> 00:26:51,961
What's this?
- Are you able to understand? No.

355
00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:53,127
How did he do it?
I'm not able to get it.

356
00:26:53,317 --> 00:26:56,298
I too didn't get it.
How could he do it?

357
00:26:56,487 --> 00:26:59,297
He might have copied it from
some guide book.

358
00:27:00,491 --> 00:27:01,469
Come, let's go & ask him.

359
00:27:01,659 --> 00:27:04,071
Ask him? No way,
I'll ask Seenu.

360
00:27:07,331 --> 00:27:09,743
What's wrong in asking from anyone
if we don't know?

361
00:27:10,167 --> 00:27:14,138
I feel he's innocent.
Come, I'll ask him.

362
00:27:14,672 --> 00:27:15,150
Come.

363
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:18,817
Excuse me.

364
00:27:23,681 --> 00:27:25,490
We are not able to
understand this problem.

365
00:27:26,017 --> 00:27:27,325
Can you please teach us?

366
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:38,101
Didn't I tell you he is proud?

367
00:27:46,037 --> 00:27:47,778
Can't stand there even for a minute!

368
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:50,019
He smells so bad...
Yeah...yeah.

369
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,160
God!

370
00:28:54,105 --> 00:28:57,518
I think food is rotten.

371
00:29:11,622 --> 00:29:14,193
Oh my God! He's eating
rotten food also.

372
00:29:17,962 --> 00:29:20,101
I can't eat anymore.
I'm going.

373
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:23,438
It's stinking like the drain.
- Hey Seenu, wait. I'm also coming.

374
00:29:50,828 --> 00:29:51,898
You want to share.

375
00:30:17,855 --> 00:30:20,836
I feel little delicate
to eat alone.

376
00:30:21,358 --> 00:30:23,736
If you want, eat it
or else leave it.

377
00:31:39,603 --> 00:31:41,412
Adi, this is my
friend's bike.

378
00:31:41,605 --> 00:31:43,744
I begged, kneeled at his feet
and brought it.

379
00:31:43,941 --> 00:31:46,421
Don't fall down while trying to
show heroics before Divya.

380
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,920
If anything happens to the bike,
I'm finished.

381
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:57,360
Hey, where are you going?

382
00:31:58,455 --> 00:32:01,163
She slapped me in public for
kissing her, didn't she?

383
00:32:02,126 --> 00:32:02,695
That's why.

384
00:32:03,794 --> 00:32:07,765
Watch, I'll kiss her
from head to toe.

385
00:32:10,134 --> 00:32:12,944
There shouldn't be a place left in her body
where I haven't kissed.

386
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:17,441
After that I don't mind if she slaps
me or beats me with a slipper.

387
00:32:17,641 --> 00:32:19,621
Bloody rogue!
Did you call me for this?

388
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:22,120
She's already slapping
for everything,

389
00:32:22,313 --> 00:32:23,621
and it seems her father is
a D.l.G. of Police.

390
00:32:23,814 --> 00:32:27,853
No need, let's go away.
- Hey Eunuch! Get lost.

391
00:32:28,485 --> 00:32:29,623
You go & tell our boys.

392
00:32:30,321 --> 00:32:33,632
Tomorrow she'll come to the
college dripping in shyness.

393
00:32:34,491 --> 00:32:34,969
Go.

394
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,071
Go & eat curd rice at home. Go.

395
00:32:38,662 --> 00:32:41,802
God, I think he'll take me to Central
jail for going with him.

396
00:32:41,999 --> 00:32:43,979
Today, I'll show you,
who's a real man.

397
00:32:44,335 --> 00:32:44,870
I'm coming.

398
00:32:46,003 --> 00:32:46,811
She was here only, wasn't she?

399
00:32:54,345 --> 00:32:59,345
<i>TAMILINI</i>

400
00:33:35,052 --> 00:33:39,523
My head is jumping with joy
on seeing a golden statue.

401
00:33:39,723 --> 00:33:44,365
It's skipping a beat
on seeing her.

402
00:33:44,561 --> 00:33:49,032
My heart has caught fire like
cotton with her one glance.

403
00:33:49,233 --> 00:33:53,875
My head is flying in dreams.
I'm on cloud nine.

404
00:34:02,413 --> 00:34:03,892
Bloody thief!

405
00:34:04,081 --> 00:34:05,219
I knew the moment you
entered the room.

406
00:34:05,416 --> 00:34:06,394
You've come to steal
the chocolate.

407
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:08,824
Leave it...leave it.
- I'll tell father.

408
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:17,896
<i>TAMILINI</i>

409
00:34:18,595 --> 00:34:20,404
Hey, what's that noise?

410
00:34:25,769 --> 00:34:27,908
My sweet brother. Please eat.

411
00:34:28,105 --> 00:34:29,083
Enough sister.

412
00:34:29,773 --> 00:34:31,582
Aren't you my sweet
little brother. Please eat.

413
00:34:31,775 --> 00:34:34,756
Enough sister. How much can I
eat alone? You too have little.

414
00:34:36,113 --> 00:34:38,593
If not for you, for whom
I've bought all this.

415
00:34:39,116 --> 00:34:42,427
If you eat, I'll be very happy.
Okay, dear...eat.

416
00:34:45,956 --> 00:34:48,869
Monkey! lf i buy anything, you'll
come, steal & eat it. - Hey, get lost.

417
00:34:55,466 --> 00:34:58,106
Hey, I hit you unwittingly.
- Shut your mouth.

418
00:34:58,302 --> 00:35:00,282
Then, allow me to see cartoons on T.V.
- I've to study, boy.

419
00:35:00,471 --> 00:35:02,951
Father, Divya has hit me.

420
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,278
Rogue! do as you wish.

421
00:35:09,313 --> 00:35:10,553
<i>Is he kissing her for so long?</i>

422
00:35:28,832 --> 00:35:30,812
Isn't Jerry comical
in this dress?

423
00:35:33,837 --> 00:35:35,646
Now watch, his head will swell.

424
00:36:03,867 --> 00:36:05,403
Oh God!

425
00:36:12,543 --> 00:36:13,419
What man?

426
00:36:22,553 --> 00:36:23,224
Good morning sir.

427
00:36:28,892 --> 00:36:29,370
Hello.

428
00:36:32,062 --> 00:36:32,540
Hello.

429
00:36:33,564 --> 00:36:36,545
My name is Vinod.
What's your name?

430
00:36:39,903 --> 00:36:42,543
Oh Divya! Nice name.

431
00:36:44,741 --> 00:36:48,052
My parents?
They're in my native place.

432
00:36:48,745 --> 00:36:50,986
I'm staying here
in the hostel.

433
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:55,556
My father is working in
Central Government.

434
00:36:55,919 --> 00:36:57,057
Mother is a housewife.

435
00:37:00,924 --> 00:37:03,734
It's difficult
to stay away from them.

436
00:37:03,927 --> 00:37:05,565
But, what can I do?
I've to pursue the studies.

437
00:37:06,597 --> 00:37:08,133
What's your father?

438
00:37:08,765 --> 00:37:10,745
Oh! Is he working in Railways?

439
00:37:11,602 --> 00:37:13,912
For a coffee? To canteen?

440
00:37:14,771 --> 00:37:15,749
I'll come later.

441
00:37:17,941 --> 00:37:19,249
Where's your house?

442
00:37:20,277 --> 00:37:21,347
In T.Nagar?

443
00:37:21,612 --> 00:37:22,352
Where's that...

444
00:38:01,652 --> 00:38:02,130
Hello!

445
00:38:03,654 --> 00:38:07,625
My name is Divya.
What's your name?

446
00:38:08,659 --> 00:38:11,799
Oh Vinod! Nice name.

447
00:38:13,664 --> 00:38:15,974
My parents are here only.

448
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:20,804
My father is D.l.G. of Police.
My mother is housewife.

449
00:38:21,672 --> 00:38:24,983
I'm my mother's favourite.
My father is very strict.

450
00:38:26,343 --> 00:38:26,980
Then...then.

451
00:38:28,845 --> 00:38:31,553
My house isn't in T.Nagar,
but in Boat Club.

452
00:38:33,517 --> 00:38:34,655
Coffee!

453
00:38:35,018 --> 00:38:37,430
I'm asking you for the first time
to join me for a coffee.

454
00:38:38,021 --> 00:38:39,830
You're refusing the offer.
Come, let's go.

455
00:38:45,195 --> 00:38:48,176
Not now, let's go in
the interval. Okay?

456
00:39:08,385 --> 00:39:10,922
She escaped from me yesterday.
Today, I'll kill her.

457
00:39:17,227 --> 00:39:19,207
Hey, come here...come.

458
00:39:25,902 --> 00:39:26,880
What happened?

459
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,550
He said she'll come to
college dripping in shyness.

460
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,811
Look, he's struggling here.

461
00:39:36,913 --> 00:39:43,296
Hey, please don't do it.
Please listen to me.- Leave me.

462
00:39:48,759 --> 00:39:49,635
Come Vinod.

463
00:39:52,763 --> 00:39:54,902
Yuck! If you love anyone, inform us.

464
00:39:57,434 --> 00:40:03,407
Love and lover's head is
playing the hide & seek game.

465
00:40:03,607 --> 00:40:09,922
Butterflies are fluttering in
the eyes that are searching.

466
00:40:10,113 --> 00:40:16,257
He's searching himself somewhere.

467
00:40:16,453 --> 00:40:22,665
He's talking to himself
forgetting his mother tongue.

468
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:28,932
Love is an enigma.
Don't know if it's wind or fire.

469
00:40:29,132 --> 00:40:35,674
Though eyes are wide awake,
I'm unconscious in love.

470
00:41:14,845 --> 00:41:19,845
<i>TAMILINI</i>

471
00:41:52,549 --> 00:41:58,761
Till yesterday I was here only.
Today, I'm missing myself.

472
00:41:59,055 --> 00:42:04,869
There's no rain or sunshine.
I've seen the rainbow.

473
00:42:05,061 --> 00:42:11,706
I've admired the beauty which has killed
me without really killing me.

474
00:42:11,902 --> 00:42:17,716
I drew her in my head.

475
00:42:56,947 --> 00:43:01,947
<i>TAMILINI</i>

476
00:43:35,151 --> 00:43:37,961
I was walking alone
in a desert

477
00:43:38,321 --> 00:43:41,302
You came and held an
umbrella for me.

478
00:43:41,491 --> 00:43:47,635
I had forgotten my name,
you gave me a new identity.

479
00:43:47,831 --> 00:43:54,146
I saw my face in the
mirror of your head.

480
00:43:54,337 --> 00:44:00,481
My head will bloom with
your arrival only.

481
00:44:00,677 --> 00:44:03,658
Once rivers join the sea,
they'll lose their identity.

482
00:44:03,847 --> 00:44:06,828
In friendship you'll
forget worries.

483
00:44:07,183 --> 00:44:13,566
When 2 heads are united,
there's no day or night for them.

484
00:44:51,895 --> 00:44:53,932
Hey Divya, come on 'yaar'.
- Hey Seenu.

485
00:44:54,731 --> 00:44:55,709
What's this?- Sorry...sorry.

486
00:44:56,232 --> 00:44:57,870
If you don't like it, it's okay.
- Vinod, you come.

487
00:44:58,735 --> 00:45:01,875
Please no, Divya.
Everyone is watching us.

488
00:45:02,572 --> 00:45:03,710
I'm not able to differentiate
between man & woman.

489
00:45:35,438 --> 00:45:36,314
Good evening, sir.

490
00:45:37,774 --> 00:45:40,584
You've come with a
boy at this hour.

491
00:45:40,777 --> 00:45:42,256
What should I think?

492
00:45:42,946 --> 00:45:44,983
Father, please.
He's Vinod.

493
00:45:46,616 --> 00:45:47,094
Sir.

494
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:50,598
He's a genius in our college.

495
00:45:50,787 --> 00:45:54,428
I've begged & cajoled him to come here
to teach me for exams.

496
00:45:54,791 --> 00:45:58,000
Is he a mad man to
come to our house?

497
00:45:58,795 --> 00:46:01,002
What did I ask her,
she's so angry?

498
00:46:01,297 --> 00:46:02,275
We haven't eaten.

499
00:46:02,465 --> 00:46:04,342
Prepare tea for us.
We are studying together tonight.

500
00:46:04,801 --> 00:46:07,611
Don't lock the gate.
Vinod must go home.

501
00:46:10,306 --> 00:46:11,614
This is my room.
Please come in.

502
00:46:15,812 --> 00:46:17,951
What happened?
You're looking stunned.

503
00:46:52,582 --> 00:46:54,323
I've to buy many books. I'll take them.
- Hey, what're you doing?

504
00:47:33,389 --> 00:47:35,869
Vinod, I think you're yearning
for your parents.

505
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:38,198
Go home and meet your parents.

506
00:47:38,561 --> 00:47:40,370
Hi! I saw his statute
on the way.

507
00:47:54,577 --> 00:47:56,716
Divya! Where should I pass urine?

508
00:48:01,751 --> 00:48:03,560
Hey, we must study. Get up.

509
00:48:18,101 --> 00:48:21,480
Oh God! I'm hungry.
I'm feeling cold.

510
00:48:26,109 --> 00:48:26,814
What happened?

511
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,160
Hey, leave her.
Leave her I say.

512
00:49:16,926 --> 00:49:18,462
Divya...Devi

513
00:49:23,666 --> 00:49:26,476
Vinod, do you've any problem?

514
00:49:26,669 --> 00:49:28,307
I don't have any problem.
I'm happy.

515
00:49:28,504 --> 00:49:29,778
You're with me, aren't you?

516
00:49:35,678 --> 00:49:37,749
Studying to impress a girl
will be like this only.

517
00:49:41,017 --> 00:49:42,826
Will she love you even if
you study well?

518
00:49:43,019 --> 00:49:44,498
Where's the answer
to this question?

519
00:49:55,031 --> 00:49:57,011
Why're you still holding
a text book?

520
00:49:57,533 --> 00:49:59,171
Just only one answer.
One minute sir.

521
00:49:59,369 --> 00:50:00,677
No...no...- I must score
high marks in exam.

522
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:02,008
Only then, Divya will love me.

523
00:50:02,205 --> 00:50:03,684
Sir, this is a question
of life & death for me.

524
00:50:03,873 --> 00:50:06,513
Give. Come on, give. Now you go.
- Get lost bald man.

525
00:50:09,879 --> 00:50:11,859
God! I must write exams well and
Divya must love me, please.

526
00:50:14,717 --> 00:50:16,526
It's enough if Divya loves me.

527
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,550
I was writing well.

528
00:51:54,817 --> 00:51:57,457
Suddenly, I forgot the answer
to a question.

529
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:01,358
I tried my best to recollect,
but failed miserably.

530
00:52:01,824 --> 00:52:03,303
When I tried to answer
the next question,

531
00:52:03,826 --> 00:52:05,134
I forgot the answer of
the next question also.

532
00:52:06,162 --> 00:52:07,698
I got tensed up.

533
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:11,141
Till now, I've never failed
in any examination.

534
00:52:12,168 --> 00:52:15,308
If my father comes to know about this.
He'll abuse me.

535
00:52:16,172 --> 00:52:18,379
I feel like dying, Vinod.

536
00:52:38,194 --> 00:52:41,004
No sir. This will definitely not be
the handiwork of any student.

537
00:52:41,197 --> 00:52:43,336
I think it must be
electrical shod circuit.

538
00:52:43,533 --> 00:52:45,513
What are you planning to do?
- I don't know sir.

539
00:52:45,868 --> 00:52:48,075
Most probably they'll postpone
it to next year.

540
00:52:48,538 --> 00:52:50,279
Poor students, they worked so hard.

541
00:52:53,543 --> 00:52:54,521
Why're you crying?

542
00:52:55,211 --> 00:52:56,952
Is it for the answer sheets
that got burnt.

543
00:52:59,048 --> 00:53:01,426
Don't cry...please.

544
00:53:01,884 --> 00:53:02,954
Don't cry, Vinod.

545
00:53:05,555 --> 00:53:08,695
No, Divya. I would've definitely
won the gold medal.

546
00:53:09,225 --> 00:53:10,704
I've to write the exams again.

547
00:53:11,894 --> 00:53:14,374
No problem. Whenever
you write the examination,

548
00:53:14,564 --> 00:53:16,202
only you'll win the gold medal.

549
00:53:16,566 --> 00:53:19,706
Is there anyone who can
beat you in studies?

550
00:53:20,236 --> 00:53:21,374
Will you cry for such a silly reason?

551
00:53:22,238 --> 00:53:25,048
You're crying for missing
a gold medal.

552
00:53:25,241 --> 00:53:30,122
I'm happy for escaping from
failing in the examination.

553
00:53:31,914 --> 00:53:32,551
Then, what?

554
00:53:32,915 --> 00:53:36,226
I wouldn't have got even
10 marks in this examination.

555
00:53:36,419 --> 00:53:38,330
Definitely, I would've failed.

556
00:53:38,588 --> 00:53:41,728
Now, God has given me
another chance.

557
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,900
Yes, isn't it?
- Cheer up Vinod.

558
00:53:47,096 --> 00:53:50,566
To celebrate completion of examinations
my friends are going to see a film.

559
00:53:50,766 --> 00:53:51,904
Come, let's also go with them.

560
00:53:52,101 --> 00:53:54,081
I don't have money, Divya.
- Hey, come.

561
00:53:56,772 --> 00:53:59,082
Oh God! - Hey you, bastard.

562
00:53:59,275 --> 00:54:01,755
How dare...
How dare you try to...

563
00:54:01,944 --> 00:54:02,684
What happened?

564
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,418
I must curse you.

565
00:54:05,948 --> 00:54:08,428
How many times I've told you
that he gives me dirty looks.

566
00:54:08,618 --> 00:54:09,426
Did you listen to me?

567
00:54:10,286 --> 00:54:11,424
Do you know where he
put his hands?

568
00:54:11,621 --> 00:54:12,759
What happened, Vinod?

569
00:54:12,955 --> 00:54:15,367
You bloody rascal! Will you put
your hands on my friend?

570
00:54:15,558 --> 00:54:17,629
Leave him. - I know from where
you would've come.

571
00:54:17,827 --> 00:54:27,441
Don't beat him.
- Hey, leave him...leave him.

572
00:54:27,637 --> 00:54:29,275
Go...go man.

573
00:54:29,472 --> 00:54:33,181
They come as friends and put
hands as soon as the hall becomes dark.

574
00:54:33,476 --> 00:54:34,853
College students are
real nasty persons.

575
00:54:35,311 --> 00:54:36,119
Hey, beat him.

576
00:54:36,312 --> 00:54:37,188
Look at the nasty things he does
in the garb of student.

577
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:38,856
They come here for
such things only.

578
00:54:41,984 --> 00:54:42,621
Go man...go.

579
00:54:45,321 --> 00:54:47,301
You'll enter if we give
you a leeway.

580
00:54:47,657 --> 00:54:49,728
This is our problem, we'll settle
it between ourselves.

581
00:54:49,992 --> 00:54:51,300
You keep away from it.

582
00:54:51,494 --> 00:54:52,734
Please Swetha, don't cry.

583
00:54:52,995 --> 00:54:54,497
Whatever it is, let's settle it
in the college.

584
00:54:54,697 --> 00:54:55,903
Seenu, take her home.

585
00:54:59,502 --> 00:55:00,947
She's my friend for the
past 10 years.

586
00:55:01,303 --> 00:55:02,941
I would've beaten
this rogue to death.

587
00:55:03,639 --> 00:55:05,915
I'm sparing him for you.
Try to understand.

588
00:55:10,112 --> 00:55:11,750
Okay Divya. I'll take leave now.

589
00:55:15,718 --> 00:55:17,095
Vinod, go to a doctor.

590
00:55:17,753 --> 00:55:18,356
Raju...come.

591
00:55:20,256 --> 00:55:22,634
Adi, I know wasn't it you
who put the hands?

592
00:55:22,825 --> 00:55:24,896
Hey, don't blabber something and
put me into a fix.

593
00:55:25,094 --> 00:55:27,074
I never did it. I was sitting
2 rows behind her.

594
00:55:27,263 --> 00:55:28,799
Divya, are you coming
with us or not?

595
00:55:29,298 --> 00:55:30,971
Has he become more
important than us?

596
00:55:35,004 --> 00:55:37,280
I thought you'll get caught.
How did you manage to escape?

597
00:55:37,473 --> 00:55:39,180
That's the Psychology of girls.

598
00:55:39,675 --> 00:55:41,655
You say you're a friends and
touch any where.

599
00:55:42,011 --> 00:55:43,649
You'll never be suspected
of debauchery.

600
00:55:43,846 --> 00:55:44,756
Hey Vinod!

601
00:55:46,082 --> 00:55:48,187
Would he have known
that you were the culprit?

602
00:55:48,417 --> 00:55:50,226
Let him, what the hell can he do?

603
00:55:50,586 --> 00:55:52,031
Would he have spared Divya without
pawing & probing?

604
00:55:52,221 --> 00:55:53,894
Vinod, will you join us for a game?

605
00:55:58,728 --> 00:56:01,004
Hey, why did you give
him the ball?

606
00:56:01,197 --> 00:56:02,437
Let him learn. Leave it.

607
00:56:05,434 --> 00:56:08,677
Pass it...Pass it.
Ramesh, this side...left side.

608
00:56:09,205 --> 00:56:11,014
Come to the left...right.

609
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:23,530
Play carefully.

610
00:56:25,287 --> 00:56:29,702
Come on...come on.

611
00:56:51,981 --> 00:56:53,824
Buddy, he's wantonly hitting us.

612
00:57:02,158 --> 00:57:05,605
Whom are you hitting?

613
00:58:44,827 --> 00:58:46,500
Look Divya.

614
00:58:47,129 --> 00:58:49,541
When I asked him why did he put
hands on Swetha,

615
00:58:50,432 --> 00:58:52,503
mental . . .psycho.

616
00:58:53,002 --> 00:58:55,073
Look, he has beaten me up.

617
00:58:56,038 --> 00:58:56,607
Beast!

618
00:58:57,907 --> 00:58:59,682
Don't be friendly with him.

619
00:59:00,009 --> 00:59:01,488
He can do anything.

620
00:59:02,278 --> 00:59:05,054
Didn't I tell you we'll complain
to the principal?

621
00:59:05,247 --> 00:59:07,249
You stopped me saying
it'll spoil his studies.

622
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:10,628
Look, how he has beaten Seenu.

623
00:59:13,956 --> 00:59:19,963
In friendship, there's nothing
such as separation.

624
00:59:20,162 --> 00:59:25,874
No need of words for our heads
to exchange views.

625
00:59:26,168 --> 00:59:31,846
Myriads of thoughts are running
shelter-skeeter in my head.

626
00:59:32,041 --> 00:59:38,117
All are vying to attract
your attention.

627
00:59:38,314 --> 00:59:43,957
How many more days will
I live like this?

628
00:59:44,153 --> 00:59:49,153
If you withdraw yourself from me,
under whose shade will I get solace?

629
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:56,460
<i>TAMILINI</i>

630
01:00:04,173 --> 01:00:05,174
Good morning everybody.

631
01:00:05,407 --> 01:00:08,980
You know about the yearly National
Seminar conducted in our college.

632
01:00:09,178 --> 01:00:11,715
This time the prize money
is Rs.50,000.

633
01:00:11,947 --> 01:00:16,589
Plus admissions to foreign Universities,
job offers...and everything.

634
01:00:16,785 --> 01:00:20,121
Now, 15 students from this class are
going to present papers.

635
01:00:20,122 --> 01:00:23,126
To start with Mr.Vinod
on Therm o-resins.

636
01:00:23,392 --> 01:00:28,774
My paper is about Thermos-resins...

637
01:00:34,069 --> 01:00:39,849
It is...it is...it consists...

638
01:00:41,377 --> 01:00:44,950
...by...by heating.

639
01:00:50,986 --> 01:00:52,260
Vinod, I love you.

640
01:00:52,454 --> 01:00:54,525
Vinod, it's okay.
Stan from the beginning.

641
01:00:56,425 --> 01:00:59,031
No sir, I'll leave this college.

642
01:00:59,628 --> 01:01:00,834
Give me T.C.

643
01:01:02,097 --> 01:01:02,768
No sir.

644
01:01:03,065 --> 01:01:05,306
You can make it.
Please listen to me.

645
01:01:05,768 --> 01:01:07,748
Vinod, come back...
Come back.

646
01:01:11,907 --> 01:01:16,185
Silence.

647
01:01:17,046 --> 01:01:18,525
I don't know anything, father.

648
01:01:18,714 --> 01:01:22,924
He never told me he's an orphan
and doesn't have anyone.

649
01:01:23,118 --> 01:01:24,290
How could he?

650
01:01:25,054 --> 01:01:27,432
You're torturing him so much
when he hasn't told you.

651
01:01:28,023 --> 01:01:30,060
Wouldn't you've torn him apart
if he had told you?

652
01:01:30,325 --> 01:01:31,429
How can he tell you?

653
01:01:40,102 --> 01:01:44,107
You never told me you lived
in such conditions to study.

654
01:01:44,807 --> 01:01:46,150
Is this your hostel?

655
01:01:46,608 --> 01:01:47,678
Where are your parents?

656
01:01:48,343 --> 01:01:49,583
Are you a waiter in a Hotel?

657
01:01:49,778 --> 01:01:52,554
Day time at college,
nights you work.

658
01:01:53,015 --> 01:01:54,050
When will you sleep?

659
01:01:54,616 --> 01:01:56,926
I don't want anyone's sympathies.
I'm going back to my place.

660
01:01:58,087 --> 01:01:59,088
You shouldn't go.

661
01:01:59,455 --> 01:02:01,731
Get lost.
Go back to your friends.

662
01:02:02,524 --> 01:02:03,093
Leave me.

663
01:02:03,292 --> 01:02:05,033
I don't want them,
I want only you.

664
01:02:05,227 --> 01:02:07,070
Leave me...I'll go back
to my place.

665
01:02:07,329 --> 01:02:08,569
Leave me.

666
01:02:11,433 --> 01:02:13,743
Do you know the hell I had been through
for 2 days without talking to you?

667
01:02:14,303 --> 01:02:17,512
Will you go away?
I'll kill you.

668
01:02:18,774 --> 01:02:19,411
Get lost.

669
01:02:19,842 --> 01:02:20,684
Why did you come here?

670
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:23,315
You kept quiet when they
insulted me in the theater.

671
01:02:23,545 --> 01:02:25,855
Did you say one word
in my support?

672
01:02:26,081 --> 01:02:27,355
Why the hell did you
come here now?

673
01:02:28,317 --> 01:02:31,355
If you say anything,
I'll break your teeth.

674
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,498
I'll...hey!

675
01:02:32,855 --> 01:02:36,701
Didn't you sleep in my bed room?
How can I suspect you?

676
01:02:36,892 --> 01:02:38,098
Why didn't you speak to me then?

677
01:02:38,293 --> 01:02:40,603
Should you beat him mercilessly?
Even if he had really done it.

678
01:02:40,796 --> 01:02:41,536
Will you beat him like that?

679
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:42,435
Greeting sir.

680
01:02:42,998 --> 01:02:45,103
I'm Father Rosario.
- Father!

681
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:46,108
Do you remember me?

682
01:02:46,401 --> 01:02:47,209
Father!

683
01:02:56,645 --> 01:02:58,181
Why're you buying
all this for me?

684
01:03:01,016 --> 01:03:04,156
All are priced in 1000's.
I don't have money now.

685
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:08,567
Which color shirt do you like?

686
01:03:11,193 --> 01:03:13,264
No Divya, I don't want.

687
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:19,140
We've come to a shop.

688
01:03:19,468 --> 01:03:22,813
I thought we'll go
back home together.

689
01:03:23,105 --> 01:03:26,052
If you want us to go separately,
it's your wish.

690
01:03:26,475 --> 01:03:27,476
Divya, please listen.

691
01:03:27,676 --> 01:03:29,178
Take it. Wear this and come to the seminar.

692
01:03:30,179 --> 01:03:30,919
What?

693
01:03:31,113 --> 01:03:32,251
I'm not for this game.

694
01:03:32,447 --> 01:03:34,017
Leave me.
- Where're you running away?

695
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:36,688
You know about me, don't you?

696
01:03:38,053 --> 01:03:39,691
I'll not fall for this.

697
01:03:39,888 --> 01:03:42,266
Divya, please.
- No chance.

698
01:03:43,125 --> 01:03:44,195
You're saying it
for fun, aren't you?

699
01:03:44,826 --> 01:03:46,828
You're really participating.
- I can't do it.

700
01:03:47,029 --> 01:03:49,134
Hey, listen to me.

701
01:03:49,998 --> 01:03:52,478
Why do you want to insult
me in public?

702
01:03:52,668 --> 01:03:54,648
What's there to feel
insulted in it?

703
01:03:55,837 --> 01:03:58,545
They had insulted you
in the class room.

704
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:01,787
No one sat next to you in the class.
No one talks to you.

705
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:03,421
They make derisive comments
on seeing you.

706
01:04:03,612 --> 01:04:07,219
Didn't my friend Swetha thought
bad about you in the theatre?

707
01:04:07,549 --> 01:04:12,225
They all must get shocked and
astonished for a second.

708
01:04:13,922 --> 01:04:18,337
Show them what you can be if you
had the same opportunities: Show them.

709
01:04:19,328 --> 01:04:21,808
You needn't win in the Seminar.
- No need.

710
01:04:22,297 --> 01:04:24,538
Any way, you'll not win.
- Definitely not.

711
01:04:25,033 --> 01:04:26,410
Make a try.
- Make a try.

712
01:04:27,202 --> 01:04:28,510
You just come on the dais,

713
01:04:28,704 --> 01:04:32,982
students will applause, that's enough
for me.- That's enough for me.

714
01:04:33,508 --> 01:04:38,719
Never give up without a try.
- Don't give up.- Keep trying.

715
01:04:38,947 --> 01:04:41,223
You'll win one day.
- One day.

716
01:04:41,416 --> 01:04:43,828
Hey, go & stand near
the entrance.

717
01:04:44,119 --> 01:04:45,826
I too wanted to tell
him something.

718
01:04:46,288 --> 01:04:49,565
No need of your advises.
I'll tell him.

719
01:04:49,758 --> 01:04:52,500
What I'm trying to say is...
- Hey, get lost man.

720
01:04:52,894 --> 01:04:53,929
Hi Vincent!

721
01:05:06,241 --> 01:05:08,744
Didn't I tell you,
it'll not work out well?

722
01:05:22,658 --> 01:05:23,568
Am I looking good?

723
01:05:28,964 --> 01:05:29,442
Oh God!

724
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:34,071
Why're you walking like a
duck spreading your legs?

725
01:05:34,836 --> 01:05:35,644
Keep your legs together.

726
01:05:37,706 --> 01:05:38,411
Now walk.

727
01:05:42,044 --> 01:05:42,715
Like that only.

728
01:05:43,979 --> 01:05:44,457
Very good.

729
01:05:50,452 --> 01:05:51,362
Look at the audience.

730
01:05:56,558 --> 01:05:57,366
Don't get scared.

731
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:03,539
Now, give a stylish smile.

732
01:06:03,965 --> 01:06:06,502
Audience must get charmed
by your smile.

733
01:06:09,571 --> 01:06:11,312
If you laugh like this,

734
01:06:12,007 --> 01:06:13,918
audience will get
scared and leave.

735
01:06:14,643 --> 01:06:15,314
Look at me.

736
01:06:17,112 --> 01:06:17,817
Beautifully...

737
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:19,017
Slowly...

738
01:06:19,881 --> 01:06:20,916
Opening your mouth.

739
01:06:26,621 --> 01:06:28,862
Why're you showing all your teeth?

740
01:06:30,292 --> 01:06:32,772
Without opening your mouth,
that's enough.

741
01:06:33,795 --> 01:06:35,706
All this is very important
in a Seminar.

742
01:06:35,897 --> 01:06:36,398
Okay...okay...

743
01:06:36,598 --> 01:06:37,235
Look at me.

744
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,308
I welcome everybody.

745
01:06:40,669 --> 01:06:42,842
Today, I'm going to submit my paper...

746
01:06:49,244 --> 01:06:50,222
What's this?

747
01:06:50,412 --> 01:06:51,686
Don't touch it. Wait.
I'll show.

748
01:06:51,913 --> 01:06:54,120
What's there in the cover?
- Don't be in a hurry.

749
01:06:56,284 --> 01:06:56,989
What's this?

750
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:02,725
Happy birthday.

751
01:07:02,924 --> 01:07:09,000
What am I to call you,
a friend or my better half?

752
01:07:09,197 --> 01:07:15,204
What am I to call it,
my love or my search?

753
01:07:15,404 --> 01:07:21,047
My head is floating
like a cloud.

754
01:07:22,844 --> 01:07:26,656
Don't say another word.
Wear it for tomorrow's seminar.

755
01:07:29,017 --> 01:07:31,327
Did you see this?
Birthday candle.

756
01:07:31,686 --> 01:07:36,260
Make any wish. It'll definitely
get fulfilled.

757
01:07:36,691 --> 01:07:39,433
God! I must win at
tomorrow's Seminar.

758
01:07:39,728 --> 01:07:42,800
Get a good job, must go to U.S.

759
01:07:43,031 --> 01:07:44,032
Pray for all this.

760
01:07:45,133 --> 01:07:46,578
I'll go now...bye.

<i>TAMILINI</i>

762
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:10,597
The gentle breeze which is
going away touching me,

763
01:08:10,792 --> 01:08:13,170
won't it engulf my entire body?

764
01:08:13,361 --> 01:08:15,739
The intermittent drizzle
that is falling on me,

765
01:08:15,931 --> 01:08:17,706
won't it become a heavy
torrential rain?

766
01:08:17,899 --> 01:08:20,277
A shyness, touched me today.

767
01:08:20,469 --> 01:08:23,006
I'm able to understand the
meaning in her eyes.

768
01:08:23,205 --> 01:08:25,082
I can see the path I'm treading.

769
01:08:25,273 --> 01:08:27,981
As my head & soul
gets charmed,

770
01:08:28,176 --> 01:08:30,486
is it a word or silence?

771
01:08:30,679 --> 01:08:33,057
Is Rainbow just a colour?

772
01:08:33,248 --> 01:08:38,425
Will it shine bright, when I search
for her in distress.

773

774
01:09:48,757 --> 01:09:50,703
Will this dream come true?

775
01:09:51,259 --> 01:09:53,170
Can I see her everyday?

776
01:09:53,862 --> 01:09:59,335
With your arrival, will I get
the new world?

777
01:09:59,568 --> 01:10:04,347
My friend, with the touch of your fingers.
I've become God.

778
01:10:04,573 --> 01:10:09,318
A head surrounded by fence...
I've seen a white flag on it.

779
01:10:09,511 --> 01:10:14,187
When I faltered & fell down &
saw the foot marks,

780
01:10:14,382 --> 01:10:19,388
there's only one sky and one earth.
I've decided to take them on.

781
01:10:19,588 --> 01:10:21,829
I started loving Divya.

782
01:10:41,109 --> 01:10:46,109
<i>TAMILINI</i>

783
01:11:27,922 --> 01:11:30,232
The sky is moving,
Earth is moving.

784
01:11:30,425 --> 01:11:32,701
My eyes have turned red and
I'm feeling giddy.

785
01:11:32,894 --> 01:11:35,135
My head is in pain.
The night has become hot.

786
01:11:35,330 --> 01:11:37,810
I can understand, this is
also happiness.

787
01:11:38,233 --> 01:11:42,773
My head is asking me if it's the same
moon I had seen yesterday?

788
01:11:43,338 --> 01:11:47,548
My pent up emotions are getting
a new lease of life.

789
01:11:47,742 --> 01:11:50,382
I don't know which world is this.

790
01:11:50,578 --> 01:11:53,024
I'm not able to understand
it's rules & regulations.

791
01:11:53,214 --> 01:11:58,095
When I land up in the country of love.
There's nothing like delight or sadness.

<i>TAMILINI</i>

793
01:12:41,663 --> 01:12:43,870
I'm very proud to
introduce Mr. Vinod.

794
01:12:44,065 --> 01:12:47,308
Couldn't you've gone with him inside?
- You don't know about him, father.

795
01:12:47,535 --> 01:12:48,479
If I go inside,

796
01:12:48,670 --> 01:12:52,083
he'll look at me for approval
for everything that he says.

797
01:12:56,111 --> 01:13:00,423
Welcome...welcome
to my paper...

798
01:13:02,984 --> 01:13:04,429
My theory is about...

799
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:06,824
Vinod, where's Divya?

800
01:13:11,459 --> 01:13:12,802
My paper is about...

801
01:13:16,998 --> 01:13:17,703
What happened?

802
01:13:18,299 --> 01:13:19,369
Power cut.

803
01:13:21,736 --> 01:13:22,510
Come, let's go.

804
01:13:23,338 --> 01:13:26,945
If he sees us in this condition,
he'll feel guilty.

805
01:13:27,609 --> 01:13:27,916
Yes.

806
01:13:28,376 --> 01:13:29,013
MY God!

807
01:13:48,062 --> 01:13:51,202
Welcome to the distinguished judges
of National Seminar 2002.

808
01:14:13,822 --> 01:14:16,462
So, these are my points to
prove my contention,

809
01:14:16,658 --> 01:14:20,538
and I thank everybody, students,
my professor Mr. Subramaniam,

810
01:14:20,728 --> 01:14:21,900
particularly the judges,

811
01:14:22,096 --> 01:14:24,337
for listening to me with all
the patience in this world.

812
01:14:24,699 --> 01:14:27,145
Feel free to ask your doubts
after the Seminar.

813
01:14:27,569 --> 01:14:28,206
Thank you.

814
01:14:56,397 --> 01:14:58,001
Divya, I was terribly scared.

815
01:15:00,168 --> 01:15:03,911
That's all...that's, it's all over.

816
01:15:04,672 --> 01:15:05,650
You've done it.

817
01:15:12,247 --> 01:15:15,626
Didn't you ask me where's god?

818
01:15:15,984 --> 01:15:19,522
She's an angel sent by god.

819
01:15:19,721 --> 01:15:21,792
Hold on to her.
Hold on to her tightly.

820
01:15:21,990 --> 01:15:23,298
She'll take you up with her.

821
01:15:24,792 --> 01:15:27,398
You'll come back.
A glimmer of hope,

822
01:15:27,595 --> 01:15:29,506
not for me, but other inmates.

823
01:15:30,198 --> 01:15:31,541
No...you don't come back.

824
01:15:32,166 --> 01:15:33,406
Forget about orphanage.

825
01:15:33,601 --> 01:15:35,911
You follow her. Marry her.

826
01:15:36,104 --> 01:15:37,742
First go and express it to her.

827
01:15:38,606 --> 01:15:40,210
No...yes.

828
01:15:40,775 --> 01:15:41,947
You go ahead.

829
01:15:43,511 --> 01:15:44,615
God bless you.

830
01:15:45,313 --> 01:15:46,223
Bye Vinod.

831
01:15:46,948 --> 01:15:48,655
Thanks for your Rs.50,000.

832
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:50,523
Don't forget if you
go to foreign.

833
01:15:55,456 --> 01:15:58,494
Divya, you're ravishing
in this dress.

834
01:16:00,261 --> 01:16:00,898
Bastard.

835
01:16:02,830 --> 01:16:06,175
Vinod come, let's go & sit there.
- Why? - Come.

836
01:16:08,236 --> 01:16:11,240
Great chic!
She has fallen for him.

837
01:16:11,439 --> 01:16:13,919
If I had got her I would've
sucked her life out by now.

838
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:21,991
Did you come here to sleep?
- What's it? Tell me.

839
01:16:22,684 --> 01:16:25,858
Okay, you be here
don't go away.

840
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:27,665
I've been holding it
for a long time.

841
01:16:28,122 --> 01:16:29,362
I'll go to the ladies room & come.

842
01:16:29,958 --> 01:16:30,436
<i>OKEY -</i>

843
01:16:43,071 --> 01:16:45,950
Seenu, what's this?
Take your hands off me.

844
01:16:47,275 --> 01:16:48,549
Seenu, please no.
Listen to me.

845
01:16:56,484 --> 01:16:57,485
Save me.

846
01:17:08,997 --> 01:17:09,566
Don't run.

847
01:17:12,667 --> 01:17:14,146
Save me.

848
01:17:40,461 --> 01:17:41,439
What's wrong with me?

849
01:17:41,796 --> 01:17:43,605
Why isn't Divya even
looking at me?

850
01:17:43,798 --> 01:17:45,835
She's always after that Vinod.

851
01:17:46,034 --> 01:17:47,877
He has started lamenting again.
- Who's that?

852
01:17:48,236 --> 01:17:49,306
More intoxicated than us.

853
01:17:50,671 --> 01:17:52,082
May be a drug case.

854
01:17:58,246 --> 01:17:59,816
What happened Divya?

855
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:10,895
Look at me...
Open your eyes.

856
01:18:23,671 --> 01:18:24,649
Where do you want me to go?

857
01:18:27,275 --> 01:18:28,015
Go to your house.

858
01:18:31,479 --> 01:18:33,220
We can't take Divya to Hospital.

859
01:18:34,482 --> 01:18:36,689
If they mistake us,
we'll be in trouble.

860
01:18:37,285 --> 01:18:38,923
No one must talk bad about Divya.

861
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:42,499
<i>Give your sister's dress
as soon as we</i> reach <i>home.</i>

862
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:45,598
Later, we'll take her
to a hospital.

863
01:18:54,936 --> 01:18:56,176
Divya, who did this to you?

864
01:18:57,438 --> 01:18:59,645
If you don't want to reveal,
forget it.

865
01:19:05,446 --> 01:19:06,424
I can drop you at home...

866
01:19:07,448 --> 01:19:08,324
But at this late hour...

867
01:19:09,450 --> 01:19:10,428
Please Divya.

868
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:13,998
For god's sake, don't say thanks.
Take care!

869
01:19:14,455 --> 01:19:17,766
Take medicines properly.
Then, take rest.

870
01:19:19,794 --> 01:19:21,774
I don't know how to console you...

871
01:19:22,463 --> 01:19:23,271
Myriads of thoughts are coming
into my mind,

872
01:19:24,132 --> 01:19:25,440
But are unable to come out bravely.

873
01:19:25,967 --> 01:19:27,674
I shouldn't be saying all this
to you in this situation,

874
01:19:27,969 --> 01:19:30,882
I never got a chance to
spend time alone with you.

875
01:19:31,806 --> 01:19:34,616
Trust me Divya,
I sincerely love you...

876
01:19:34,809 --> 01:19:37,016
If you're in trouble...
I can't bear it...

877
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:40,220
Don't get angry, DiVVa-

878
01:19:41,482 --> 01:19:42,222
I'll take leave.

879
01:20:53,387 --> 01:20:56,527
Hey, didn't you go home last night?

880
01:20:57,725 --> 01:20:59,204
Did you come here
straight away?

881
01:20:59,393 --> 01:21:00,701
Why are you silent?

882
01:21:08,903 --> 01:21:11,315
Divya, I want to
talk to you alone.

883
01:21:12,073 --> 01:21:15,111
We're alone now.
Are we in a crowd?

884
01:21:15,576 --> 01:21:16,452
Tell me!

885
01:21:18,079 --> 01:21:20,059
You'll not get angry,
if I tell you, will you?

886
01:21:20,248 --> 01:21:21,556
You'll not say, I'm not your
friend, will you?

887
01:21:22,917 --> 01:21:26,660
I'll never get angry on you
for anything. Come out!

888
01:21:29,757 --> 01:21:31,668
Come tomorrow evening 6 p.m.
to the college road.

889
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:34,399
Take this in the after noon and
this one in the morning.

890
01:21:34,595 --> 01:21:35,232
I'll go.

891
01:21:36,264 --> 01:21:38,073
Don't forget!
I'll be waiting for you.

892
01:21:38,266 --> 01:21:39,244
Mad boy!

893
01:22:01,789 --> 01:22:03,769
Hey, bloody idiot! Are you blind?
- Sorry... sorry...

894
01:22:03,958 --> 01:22:05,596
Rogue.- Thanks!

895
01:22:11,799 --> 01:22:14,609
Where're you going?
- To the computer class.

896
01:22:19,473 --> 01:22:21,714
Then, about the thing,
I said yesterday... -What?

897
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:23,948
Coffee?- Yes.

898
01:22:25,146 --> 01:22:28,286
Okay! Hey, keep your cool!
She may slap you.

899
01:22:29,317 --> 01:22:31,388
Hello, 2 coffees. Please...2

900
01:22:37,658 --> 01:22:38,534
What's this, Divya?

901
01:22:39,994 --> 01:22:40,870
Okay, sit here.

902
01:22:41,329 --> 01:22:42,467
Hey, wait!

903
01:22:42,997 --> 01:22:46,206
Are you the old Vinod now?
Please sit down, sir.

904
01:22:52,340 --> 01:22:52,977
Coffee?

905
01:22:58,012 --> 01:22:58,990
One more coffee!

906
01:23:04,352 --> 01:23:05,888
Hey, give me one coffee.

907
01:23:08,522 --> 01:23:11,560
Hey, you said you wanted
to say something.

908
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:15,431
I don't know how to tell you.

909
01:23:17,031 --> 01:23:21,002
Divya, I'm little confused
for the past few days.

910
01:23:21,869 --> 01:23:22,347
That is...

911
01:23:22,536 --> 01:23:23,571
What's problem with your health?

912
01:23:25,873 --> 01:23:29,844
No Divya! I feel like
seeing you... always.

913
01:23:30,044 --> 01:23:34,015
Okay, see me!
Who's stopping you?

914
01:23:34,715 --> 01:23:38,185
I'm getting strange thoughts.

915
01:23:38,386 --> 01:23:40,366
I'm not able to sleep at night.

916
01:23:42,223 --> 01:23:43,930
You studied for the examinations
keeping awake all night.

917
01:23:44,392 --> 01:23:47,703
It would've become a problem.
For safe side, consult a Doctor.

918
01:23:56,070 --> 01:23:57,048
Adi, sit down!

919
01:24:11,419 --> 01:24:14,298
Adi, if you don't mind,
one more coffee please.

920
01:24:16,257 --> 01:24:17,395
Sure!

921
01:24:24,432 --> 01:24:30,246
Vinod look, what he's
doing for me?

922
01:24:31,272 --> 01:24:33,183
He's not as bad as we had thought
about him earlier.

923
01:24:34,108 --> 01:24:35,086
He's a good boy.

924
01:24:36,110 --> 01:24:39,580
Little rough!..That's all.

925
01:24:40,114 --> 01:24:41,991
He has changed a lot now a days.

926
01:24:42,450 --> 01:24:45,260
Do you know he threw the
cigarette on seeing me?

927
01:24:45,786 --> 01:24:48,596
Will you do me a favour, Vinod?

928
01:24:48,789 --> 01:24:52,202
He still thinks, I'm having
misgivings about him.

929
01:24:52,793 --> 01:24:55,774
Will you tell him, I don't
have such feelings now?

930
01:24:56,130 --> 01:24:59,339
I can tell that myself, he may think
I'm making fun of him.

931
01:25:00,801 --> 01:25:02,109
He has come.

932
01:25:02,803 --> 01:25:05,943
Vinod, please don't say loudly so
that I can overhear it.

933
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:09,280
I'll be embarrassed.
Tell him secretly.

934
01:25:16,984 --> 01:25:19,794
Hey! Tell him...tell him...

935
01:25:26,494 --> 01:25:27,234
When?

936
01:25:27,661 --> 01:25:28,639
Just now.

937
01:25:32,666 --> 01:25:35,374
Buddy...buddy...
Ask her if it's love?

938
01:25:36,003 --> 01:25:37,573
Ask her...come on ask her...

939
01:25:38,506 --> 01:25:39,576
It'll definitely be love.

940
01:25:40,508 --> 01:25:42,249
What if she says yes in
a different mood.

941
01:25:43,344 --> 01:25:45,585
Ask her...ask her...come on.

942
01:25:53,521 --> 01:25:54,329
I don't know!

943
01:26:03,531 --> 01:26:04,168
She says "don't know".

944
01:26:07,201 --> 01:26:10,182
I've got it...I've got it...

945
01:26:10,371 --> 01:26:11,509
It's love...it's definitely love...

946
01:26:11,705 --> 01:26:12,945
Look at her blushing...

947
01:26:14,708 --> 01:26:19,088
Love...love...love...
love...love...

948
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:25,030
Ask her if she'll come to a movie
with me this evening.

949
01:26:25,219 --> 01:26:26,027
Sathyam Theater!

950
01:26:41,235 --> 01:26:44,546
Okay! Ask her if I can put my hands
on her while watching the film.

951
01:26:45,739 --> 01:26:47,116
I'll beat him with slippers.

952
01:26:47,741 --> 01:26:50,722
Okay, I'll not do it.
Let's be friends.

953
01:26:51,245 --> 01:26:55,216
I'll put when she likes.
I'll not touch her now.

954
01:26:55,416 --> 01:26:58,226
Okay buddy, I'll go and
arrange money for the film.

955
01:27:01,589 --> 01:27:04,729
One humble request.
You don't come with her!

956
01:27:05,259 --> 01:27:08,468
Okay! Just today only, please.

957
01:27:10,764 --> 01:27:11,242
<i>Okay'?</i>

958
01:27:19,273 --> 01:27:21,014
Okay, I'll also go now.

959
01:27:21,942 --> 01:27:24,081
Hey, don't look at me like that.

960
01:27:25,613 --> 01:27:28,594
You said, you weren't feeling well.
Consult a Doctor.

961
01:27:28,782 --> 01:27:30,489
Okay! Bye!

962
01:28:22,336 --> 01:28:24,316
6 months later...

963
01:28:27,841 --> 01:28:29,980
I understood what life is all about.

964
01:28:31,011 --> 01:28:34,151
I went through tremendous agony in
these 6 months.

965
01:28:34,348 --> 01:28:37,989
I saw Divya & him together
in the morning,

966
01:28:39,353 --> 01:28:40,229
and in the evening,

967
01:28:40,521 --> 01:28:44,230
I heard & saw disgusting
scenes & sounds.

968
01:28:44,692 --> 01:28:45,898
Peter & his sweet head.

969
01:29:01,709 --> 01:29:04,189
Like everyone else, natural desires
awoke in me too,

970
01:29:04,712 --> 01:29:05,850
But they surfaced belatedly.

971
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:09,020
They were triggered after I had
lost Divya.

972
01:29:09,717 --> 01:29:13,529
I couldn't sleep at nights.
I started having wet dreams.

973
01:29:14,888 --> 01:29:19,860
Hey Vinod, come in.
- It's alright.

974
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:20,868
Divya asked me to give this to you.

975
01:29:24,231 --> 01:29:25,039
7'0 clock.

976
01:29:25,232 --> 01:29:27,610
Okay. Give this to Divya
and tell her that I gave it.

977
01:29:28,068 --> 01:29:28,546
<i>Okey -</i>

978
01:29:29,570 --> 01:29:31,277
Hey, thanks buddy.

979
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:38,240
<i>TAMILINI</i>

980
01:30:07,441 --> 01:30:14,916
I saw an angel & fell in love.
She merged into my soul.

981
01:30:15,616 --> 01:30:20,087
She pierced into my head.
She became my breath.

982
01:30:20,287 --> 01:30:23,427
She changed my identity.

983
01:30:24,625 --> 01:30:28,937
A butterfly came in my path,

984
01:30:29,129 --> 01:30:33,771
and left it's colours
on my finger.

985
01:30:33,967 --> 01:30:35,947
I put my finger in fire.

986
01:30:36,136 --> 01:30:42,109
I opened a shop in a deserted island.
I built a house of sand.

987
01:31:00,327 --> 01:31:05,327
<i>TAMILINI</i>

988
01:31:24,685 --> 01:31:29,685
An angel...an angel.
She's an angel...

989
01:31:43,203 --> 01:31:47,345
Oh my sweet head! A drop of tear
is dropping from my eye.

990
01:31:47,541 --> 01:31:51,683
It's enough if you understand it and
fathom it's depth.

991
01:31:51,879 --> 01:31:56,021
Why are your memories
still fresh in my mind?

992
01:31:56,216 --> 01:32:00,858
My breath becomes hot
when you breathe near me.

993
01:32:01,388 --> 01:32:10,035
Flowers which blossom on the
graves aren't adorned by anyone.

994
01:32:10,230 --> 01:32:13,700
My love & affection for
you is so enormous,

995
01:32:13,901 --> 01:32:19,544
that I totter and
my dream gets shattered.

996
01:32:40,928 --> 01:32:45,928
<i>TAMILINI</i>

997
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:17,102
Oh my friend! When you
lie on my shoulders,

998
01:33:17,297 --> 01:33:21,768
My head turns into a
devil's play ground.

999
01:33:21,969 --> 01:33:25,940
As a friend, you brought a change
in me & my life style.

1000
01:33:26,139 --> 01:33:30,519
You made me go blind in
the mirage of your love.

1001
01:33:30,811 --> 01:33:39,128
Even when wind tears the leaves,
they never get angry on wind.

1002
01:33:39,820 --> 01:33:43,131
If I'm angry with you,

1003
01:33:43,323 --> 01:33:45,303
where will I go and
whafll happen to me?

1004
01:33:45,492 --> 01:33:49,304
My success or defeat in
life <i>is</i> in your hands.

1005
01:34:16,690 --> 01:34:19,432
How many times in the day will you tell
me that "I love you."

1006
01:34:26,033 --> 01:34:29,571
Okay, I love you.

1007
01:34:30,037 --> 01:34:31,516
I love you Adi.

1008
01:34:31,705 --> 01:34:34,015
Marriage? Why're you in a hurry?

1009
01:34:34,374 --> 01:34:36,354
Wait for a year.
I promise...

1010
01:34:36,543 --> 01:34:38,853
Registered marriage? I'll hit you.

1011
01:34:39,046 --> 01:34:41,117
If my father comes to know about this,
you're finished.

1012
01:34:41,715 --> 01:34:43,695
What the hell! Give me some time.

1013
01:34:46,219 --> 01:34:47,527
Is this the house?- Yes sir.

1014
01:34:48,055 --> 01:34:49,466
You stay here.- Yes sir.

1015
01:34:52,392 --> 01:34:53,871
Where's your son?

1016
01:34:54,728 --> 01:34:55,604
Is he sleeping?

1017
01:34:57,064 --> 01:35:00,375
I've come to see the stupid face
which loves my daughter.

1018
01:35:02,903 --> 01:35:05,474
I don't like it. I'm in agony.

1019
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:09,550
I took lot of pains for 21 years to
bring up my daughter,

1020
01:35:10,077 --> 01:35:13,286
and all of a sudden it seems
some rogue is trying to take her away.

1021
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:15,617
I would've beaten that
rascal to death.

1022
01:35:16,083 --> 01:35:18,393
Sir.- It seems you're an
employee of the central government.

1023
01:35:18,585 --> 01:35:19,893
That's why, I came here to warn you.

1024
01:35:20,087 --> 01:35:22,897
Hereafter my daughter will
not attend that college.

1025
01:35:23,256 --> 01:35:26,897
I phoned Coimbatore last night
and got her a college seat there.

1026
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:31,970
I guarantee that you won't have
any problems because of my daughter.

1027
01:35:32,766 --> 01:35:36,236
Similarly, I expect the same
from your son too.

1028
01:35:36,436 --> 01:35:37,073
Did you get it?

1029
01:35:37,437 --> 01:35:41,249
I'm telling this as a
father of a daughter.

1030
01:35:41,441 --> 01:35:44,718
Don't force to me to tell
the same thing as a policeman.

1031
01:35:45,612 --> 01:35:47,853
Boys must be brought up
with an iron hand.

1032
01:35:48,115 --> 01:35:50,527
Even my daughter was shouting.

1033
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:53,594
I slapped her, she locked
herself in the room.

1034
01:35:53,787 --> 01:35:57,929
She won't talk to me for a couple
of days. She won't eat.

1035
01:35:58,125 --> 01:36:00,867
She'll threaten
to commit suicide also.

1036
01:36:01,128 --> 01:36:06,100
It's better for her to die instead of
living with a rogue of another caste.

1037
01:36:06,466 --> 01:36:10,107
We all are going to die some day.
Do you agree with me?

1038
01:36:18,812 --> 01:36:20,450
Let's make love, Mary.

1039
01:36:39,499 --> 01:36:41,638
Peter is not here.- I know.

1040
01:36:42,502 --> 01:36:43,810
I came to see you.

1041
01:36:45,505 --> 01:36:48,315
Don't get scared.
Do as I say.

1042
01:36:54,848 --> 01:36:56,919
There's no one to help me
other than you.

1043
01:36:57,851 --> 01:36:59,489
It's been 5 days since I saw Divya.

1044
01:37:00,353 --> 01:37:00,831
When I inquired in the college,

1045
01:37:01,021 --> 01:37:02,830
they said that her father has taken
the transfer certificate.

1046
01:37:03,523 --> 01:37:05,264
He came to our house
and threatened me.

1047
01:37:06,193 --> 01:37:07,672
My parents are very soft Nature.

1048
01:37:08,528 --> 01:37:10,508
They're begging me to leave all this.

1049
01:37:11,698 --> 01:37:15,077
I can't live without Divya.
I'll die.

1050
01:37:16,203 --> 01:37:21,175
But I'm clueless & scared.
Please. You must only help me.

1051
01:37:22,042 --> 01:37:26,184
If you're afraid of your own father,
what can I do?

1052
01:37:26,379 --> 01:37:28,757
I don't know.
But do something.

1053
01:37:29,549 --> 01:37:31,426
Can you live without Divya?

1054
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:35,029
Please, I see her face all over.

1055
01:37:35,222 --> 01:37:36,530
I'm going mad.

1056
01:37:37,891 --> 01:37:40,030
Please do something, buddy.

1057
01:37:43,563 --> 01:37:46,100
Okay, I'll give you an idea,
will you listen to me?

1058
01:37:48,902 --> 01:37:50,973
Do you've any relatives
in other places?

1059
01:37:53,073 --> 01:37:54,381
My uncle lives in Bangalore.

1060
01:37:56,243 --> 01:37:59,315
It's better you & Divya go to Bangalore
without anyone's knowledge.

1061
01:38:00,914 --> 01:38:03,053
Do you want us to elope?
- There's no other choice.

1062
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:06,663
I know her father,
he's a caste fanatic.

1063
01:38:07,254 --> 01:38:09,666
He would rather die than
accept your love.

1064
01:38:11,925 --> 01:38:14,405
But Divya...
- Divya won't come, I know that.

1065
01:38:14,928 --> 01:38:16,669
I'll some how bring her out.

1066
01:38:16,930 --> 01:38:20,241
You manage and take her with you.

1067
01:38:20,767 --> 01:38:22,246
Tell her that you'll commit suicide
if she doesn't come with you.

1068
01:38:24,771 --> 01:38:27,911
When?- Wait at the central station
tonight at 7.00.

1069
01:38:28,108 --> 01:38:29,485
I'll somehow bring her there.

1070
01:38:35,282 --> 01:38:38,263
What's it?
- I want to meet Divya.- Why?

1071
01:38:38,952 --> 01:38:42,092
Sir, I heard that Divya won't
come to college hereafter.

1072
01:38:42,289 --> 01:38:44,269
That's why, I want to see her
for the last time...

1073
01:38:45,292 --> 01:38:47,272
She said that she'll give me
your old pants & shins.

1074
01:38:50,297 --> 01:38:54,109
Okay go, but you must leave
immediately. Got it?

1075
01:38:54,301 --> 01:38:55,371
Yes sir.- Go.

1076
01:38:58,638 --> 01:39:00,174
Hey Adi, here's the ticket.

1077
01:39:01,308 --> 01:39:03,049
Take care, I'll get something to eat.

1078
01:39:15,989 --> 01:39:18,526
The train is about to depart
They haven't come.

1079
01:39:18,825 --> 01:39:20,862
May be they're waiting for the
family members to go to sleep.

1080
01:39:21,161 --> 01:39:22,799
Who told you to be here at 7.00 p.m.?

1081
01:39:23,330 --> 01:39:24,741
Which family goes to bed at 7.00 p.m.?

1082
01:39:24,998 --> 01:39:26,306
It's not easy to come out
of that house.

1083
01:39:26,499 --> 01:39:27,739
Won't they suspect
if she packs her luggage?

1084
01:39:28,168 --> 01:39:31,081
Look, they'll come around 12'0 clock
after everyone goes to bed.

1085
01:39:32,172 --> 01:39:34,812
Poor Vinod. He's going to stand
in the street all night.

1086
01:39:36,343 --> 01:39:38,482
Sir...see you.

1087
01:40:07,707 --> 01:40:09,186
Haven't they come yet?

1088
01:40:12,045 --> 01:40:13,922
There must be some problem.
Let's go to her house & see.

1089
01:40:14,714 --> 01:40:15,692
Search every where.

1090
01:40:15,882 --> 01:40:18,863
Look for him inside the trains
Go...go fast.

1091
01:40:19,052 --> 01:40:20,360
Search at the bus stand.

1092
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:22,366
Sir...

1093
01:40:28,395 --> 01:40:29,203
Where's my daughter?

1094
01:40:31,064 --> 01:40:31,542
Sir!

1095
01:40:31,731 --> 01:40:32,471
Hey, come.

1096
01:40:34,401 --> 01:40:38,816
Please sir. I swear I don't know.
Vinod went to bring her.

1097
01:40:39,739 --> 01:40:42,379
I waited all night but
they never turned up.

1098
01:40:44,244 --> 01:40:45,154
Who's Vinod?

1099
01:40:46,413 --> 01:40:48,552
Our friend...our classmate.

1100
01:40:49,416 --> 01:40:53,728
He's very innocent...

1101
01:40:55,088 --> 01:40:57,625
Someone migh have hit him and
taken away Divya.

1102
01:40:58,258 --> 01:41:00,829
Sir, please check it out...
please sir.

1103
01:41:09,436 --> 01:41:10,915
Switch on the light.
- Yes sir.

1104
01:41:19,779 --> 01:41:22,851
He's a good chap.
I saw him last night also.

1105
01:41:26,786 --> 01:41:27,594
May be he has gone
to his native place?

1106
01:41:27,787 --> 01:41:30,768
But he never goes without informing us.
He's very innocent.

1107
01:41:35,462 --> 01:41:37,442
Ask him to open this box.
- Sir.

1108
01:41:40,467 --> 01:41:40,945
Yuck!

1109
01:41:43,636 --> 01:41:45,206
Divya!- Go back.

1110
01:41:47,807 --> 01:41:49,218
Oh God! She's our hotel dancer.

1111
01:41:51,478 --> 01:41:52,115
Close it.

1112
01:42:43,496 --> 01:42:44,338
Ifell in love.

1113
01:42:48,868 --> 01:42:49,676
I fell in love.

1114
01:42:52,705 --> 01:42:53,342
I fell in love.

1115
01:42:55,742 --> 01:42:56,516
I fell in love.

1116
01:42:56,709 --> 01:42:58,689
Hello, who's speaking?
- Whom do you want?

1117
01:42:58,878 --> 01:43:01,188
Adi, I'm Vinod speaking.- Vinod?

1118
01:43:01,714 --> 01:43:03,284
Divya is fine.

1119
01:43:04,717 --> 01:43:07,027
I've brought Divya here
as per your instructions.

1120
01:43:08,221 --> 01:43:11,202
No...no. That's not a problem.
Everything is okay.

1121
01:43:11,558 --> 01:43:12,536
Do you want to talk to Divya?

1122
01:43:12,725 --> 01:43:14,204
What? Talk to Divya?

1123
01:43:14,394 --> 01:43:17,375
Hello, whom do you want?
This is STD Kiosk.

1124
01:43:17,564 --> 01:43:18,872
You're talking without a break.

1125
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:22,311
Did Divya's father inquire you?

1126
01:43:23,570 --> 01:43:24,878
He didn't suspect you, did he?

1127
01:43:25,238 --> 01:43:27,218
That's why, we left you there
and came here.

1128
01:43:27,907 --> 01:43:30,046
Was he worried very much?
Let him be.

1129
01:43:30,243 --> 01:43:31,221
He slapped Divya, didn't he?

1130
01:43:31,411 --> 01:43:33,391
You're talking to an
unknown person, mind it.

1131
01:43:33,746 --> 01:43:35,123
Will he change his head?

1132
01:43:35,915 --> 01:43:36,450
Good.

1133
01:43:37,417 --> 01:43:39,454
If he doesn't,
come here immediately.

1134
01:43:39,919 --> 01:43:42,331
Give it to me.
- Divya wants to speak to you.

1135
01:43:44,257 --> 01:43:44,792
Why?

1136
01:43:48,595 --> 01:43:50,074
It seems he misses you a lot.

1137
01:43:50,430 --> 01:43:51,909
He'll come here immediately,
if he hears your voice.

1138
01:43:52,098 --> 01:43:53,406
Then, all our plans will go awry.

1139
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:56,080
Hey, what's this? Are you a fool?
Idiot, stupid...

1140
01:43:56,269 --> 01:43:57,577
Hey, why're you crying?

1141
01:43:58,605 --> 01:44:01,745
Okay, you can't live without her.
You'll commit suicide.

1142
01:44:01,941 --> 01:44:03,011
I've told her everything.

1143
01:44:03,943 --> 01:44:05,752
Will Divya come out of her
house just like that?

1144
01:44:06,112 --> 01:44:07,921
Adi, I'm allright, I love you.

1145
01:44:08,114 --> 01:44:11,095
What? I love you? Who's that
playing the fool with me?

1146
01:44:13,620 --> 01:44:15,930
Come fast. Bye.

1147
01:44:19,626 --> 01:44:24,097
Why is it so cold?- Don't worry,
wait for some more time.

1148
01:44:24,430 --> 01:44:27,104
Will it not be so cold?
- It'll get much colder.

1149
01:44:33,306 --> 01:44:36,776
If Adi was here with me now...
- What if Adi was here?

1150
01:44:38,978 --> 01:44:41,390
We would've rubbed
against each other.

1151
01:44:44,317 --> 01:44:45,728
What's it?- Rub.

1152
01:44:46,986 --> 01:44:48,294
There's a difference between
you & Adi.

1153
01:44:49,989 --> 01:44:53,960
Oh God! You've grown up physically.
But your mind is still immature.

1154
01:44:54,494 --> 01:44:55,871
You & me are different.

1155
01:44:56,329 --> 01:45:00,471
There's a difference in your touch
& Adi's touch.

1156
01:45:04,003 --> 01:45:04,538
Come near me.

1157
01:45:08,675 --> 01:45:11,315
Did you feel anything now?
Nothing, isn't it?

1158
01:45:11,678 --> 01:45:14,818
But if I had kissed Adi,
that's all...

1159
01:45:16,349 --> 01:45:19,330
What will happen?
- What will happen!

1160
01:45:19,686 --> 01:45:22,826
He won't keep quiet.
He'll kiss me back.

1161
01:45:23,022 --> 01:45:26,834
Not only that,
he'll hug me tight.

1162
01:45:27,193 --> 01:45:28,171
Then...

1163
01:45:29,862 --> 01:45:30,840
Yuck! Get lost.

1164
01:45:34,701 --> 01:45:36,840
Shall I do all that?

1165
01:45:38,204 --> 01:45:41,515
You don't have any sense.
You don't know what you're talking.

1166
01:45:41,708 --> 01:45:43,779
You shouldn't do such things.
- Why?

1167
01:45:44,544 --> 01:45:46,854
Why means?...
You shouldn't do such things.

1168
01:45:47,046 --> 01:45:50,186
Tell me, why?
- Because we both are friends.

1169
01:45:50,383 --> 01:45:51,862
Friends shouldn't do such things.

1170
01:45:52,051 --> 01:45:55,123
Neither he's a grown up
nor a kid!

1171
01:46:04,230 --> 01:46:07,370
Where's Divya?- She's standing
outside the gate.

1172
01:46:07,567 --> 01:46:10,047
I told her that I'll check whether
you're in the station or not.

1173
01:46:12,405 --> 01:46:14,885
Is power restored?

1174
01:46:16,242 --> 01:46:18,882
Father, where are you going?
- I'll send back Divya.

1175
01:46:19,078 --> 01:46:22,389
Father...- Yuck. What you've done
in not at all good.

1176
01:46:22,582 --> 01:46:24,562
Father, I can't live without you.

1177
01:46:24,751 --> 01:46:28,289
Hey, she loves someone else.
Leave her.

1178
01:46:28,755 --> 01:46:31,895
Father, you told me that
she's an angel, don't leave her.

1179
01:46:32,091 --> 01:46:32,899
Now you're asking me to leave her.

1180
01:46:33,092 --> 01:46:35,231
How do I know that
she has no love lust for you?

1181
01:46:35,428 --> 01:46:36,907
You've made me hang
my head in shame.

1182
01:46:37,096 --> 01:46:40,236
Leave me.- Father.

1183
01:46:40,433 --> 01:46:41,912
Few more days, father.
- Leave me.

1184
01:46:42,101 --> 01:46:43,739
Divya will love me.

1185
01:46:43,936 --> 01:46:45,745
Father.- Leave me.

1186
01:46:45,938 --> 01:46:47,918
I'll go mad without Divya.
- Leave me.

1187
01:46:48,107 --> 01:46:50,417
No...Father...Father
- Leave me, I'm having chest pain.

1188
01:47:04,290 --> 01:47:08,329
Oh my God! Father...

1189
01:47:22,809 --> 01:47:24,015
Why're you so dull?

1190
01:47:24,811 --> 01:47:27,348
Did you meet Father?
What did he say?

1191
01:47:28,981 --> 01:47:29,686
I'm asking you, am I not?

1192
01:47:31,818 --> 01:47:34,628
Father is not in station, he has gone
to his native place. Just come with me.

1193
01:47:35,822 --> 01:47:37,028
Then, where are we going to stay?

1194
01:47:37,490 --> 01:47:38,628
You're simply walking
in the forest.

01:47:38,825 --> 01:47:41,362
Just come with me. I'll take you
to a peaceful place.

01:47:52,839 --> 01:47:55,376
Hey, where have you brought me?

1197
01:47:58,010 --> 01:47:59,250
Don't get scared, come.

1198
01:48:02,348 --> 01:48:04,919
What place is this...
...in the middle of the forest.

1199
01:48:10,356 --> 01:48:11,391
Who's living here?

1200
01:48:17,864 --> 01:48:18,672
Switch on the light.

1201
01:48:18,865 --> 01:48:21,345
I've petitioned to the
Governor for it.

1202
01:48:21,534 --> 01:48:23,013
I'll switch it on when
the power comes.

1203
01:48:25,872 --> 01:48:27,283
Then, what about eating,
sleeping...

1204
01:48:28,541 --> 01:48:29,519
In the dark only.

1205
01:48:32,712 --> 01:48:35,090
I want to go to toilet.
Where's the toilet?

1206
01:48:36,215 --> 01:48:37,285
In the open field.

1207
01:48:40,887 --> 01:48:42,958
I never believed when
others told me about you.

1208
01:48:43,222 --> 01:48:44,200
But now I believe them,

1209
01:48:44,557 --> 01:48:48,198
you...you're mad,
a lunatic, a psycho.

1210
01:48:48,728 --> 01:48:50,969
Or else you wouldn't have brought me
to such a God forsaken place?

1211
01:48:51,564 --> 01:48:53,373
What do you expect me
to do here?

1212
01:48:54,066 --> 01:48:56,876
Do you want me to sit
in the corner quietly?

1213
01:48:57,236 --> 01:49:00,217
Yuck! Did you make me
walk all along for this?

1214
01:49:01,407 --> 01:49:03,546
Mosquitoes too...

1215
01:49:05,411 --> 01:49:08,722
Who knows whether it was a
mosquito or a snake?

1216
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:10,556
There's no light to verify.

1217
01:49:11,250 --> 01:49:15,062
No. I won't talk to you
about anything.

1218
01:49:15,588 --> 01:49:17,568
You'll start to lament that you're
an orphan & so on.

01:49:18,257 --> 01:49:20,237
I can't listen to you.

1220
01:49:20,927 --> 01:49:23,806
I'll sleep. Wake me up in the
morning if I'm still alive.

1221
01:49:27,099 --> 01:49:29,079
I'm dying of hunger.

1222

I would've purchased chips.

I don't want anyone to remain
hungry because of me.

01:50:44,010 --> 01:50:45,489
Today, I've prepared only
vegetarian food.

1227

Tell me if you want non-vegetarian.
I'll prepare it, though I hate it.

I must do everything.

Staying near this beauty,
how am I to bear this torture?

What's it?
- How to wash?

1252
01:53:08,487 --> 01:53:10,228
There're so many leaves here,
use them.

1253
01:53:12,992 --> 01:53:15,131
Where did you go to the toilet?

1254
01:53:15,494 --> 01:53:17,633
Look, I've kept 3 stones there.

1255
01:53:23,502 --> 01:53:24,139
Sit down.

1256
01:53:24,503 --> 01:53:27,712
We searched all over the orphanage.
There's no evidence that they went there.

1257
01:53:28,174 --> 01:53:29,118
When I thought of inquiring from Father,

1258
01:53:29,241 --> 01:53:30,948
it seems he died of a
head attack yesterday.

1259
01:53:31,510 --> 01:53:32,716
Everything seems to be a mystery.

1260
01:53:35,848 --> 01:53:37,828
I think he has kept
Divya somewhere here.

What are you doing?

01:53:41,020 --> 01:53:42,658
You said you'll take bath here.

That's why I'm checking the depth.

01:53:45,524 --> 01:53:47,834
Wait for sometime. I'll tell you
where it's not too deep.

- No.

If you get drowned...

01:53:56,202 --> 01:53:59,513
Vinod, tell me 2 bad words
in Tamil language.

1268
01:53:59,872 --> 01:54:00,612
Why are you asking?

1269
01:54:01,540 --> 01:54:03,679

whether you know them or not.

Come.- No. I don't know to swim.

1276
01:54:46,418 --> 01:54:47,396
I'll teach you.

Do you've the thread
around your waist?- Yes.

01:54:50,422 --> 01:54:53,892
Then what? Come.
I'll teach you to swim.

What for! You never allowed me
to talk to him yesterday.

I want to hear Adi's voice.

1285

First I must tell Adi
to come here soon.

when I got the chance.

1363
02:06:00,792 --> 02:06:02,533
I should've had her fully.

1364
02:06:02,727 --> 02:06:04,798
If I keep on calling her an angel,
this will be the result.

1365
02:06:04,996 --> 02:06:06,805
That's why I'm going
to have Divya first.

1366
02:06:06,998 --> 02:06:07,738
What do you say Adi?

1367
02:06:20,345 --> 02:06:21,756
Have you left me?

1368
02:06:25,116 --> 02:06:25,992
Why were you so late?

1369
02:06:28,420 --> 02:06:31,094
Look, how you got wet in the rain?

1370
02:06:31,523 --> 02:06:32,001
Come.

1371
02:06:45,937 --> 02:06:47,848
Has the police gone away?

1372
02:06:51,042 --> 02:06:52,646
If they find out & come here
in the morning.

1373
02:06:52,844 --> 02:06:55,051
My father will get me married
forcibly to someone else.

1374
02:07:01,219 --> 02:07:03,597
I can't live without you & Adi.

1375
02:07:04,956 --> 02:07:06,094
I'll go & sleep.

1376
02:07:06,257 --> 02:07:06,928
I don't want food.

1377
02:08:15,260 --> 02:08:15,931
What happened?

1378
02:08:16,361 --> 02:08:17,465
Why have you come to sleep here?

1379
02:08:21,466 --> 02:08:23,207
Are you scared to sleep alone?

1380
02:08:24,736 --> 02:08:25,305
Come.

1381
02:08:30,775 --> 02:08:34,313
I know you're in great turmoil.

1382
02:08:35,180 --> 02:08:39,686
I thought of asking you on the day
I saw the scars on your body.

1383
02:08:41,319 --> 02:08:43,458
I didn't know whether you'll
take it in a right sense or not?

1384
02:08:44,422 --> 02:08:48,336
If I hurt you more
by asking something...

1385
02:08:50,829 --> 02:08:53,810
Even now I'm not asking you anything.

1386
02:08:54,899 --> 02:08:56,276
If you're interested,

1387
02:08:57,001 --> 02:08:58,947
if you think you can
share it with me,

1388
02:08:59,904 --> 02:09:01,884
if you really trust me,

1389
02:09:02,640 --> 02:09:04,449
tell me, I'll listen.

1390
02:09:13,818 --> 02:09:14,558
Tell me.

1391
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:18,662
I would've kept him with me,
if he was a girl.

1392
02:09:18,857 --> 02:09:20,598
He's of no use.

1393
02:09:20,792 --> 02:09:23,466
Clients doubt that I'm overaged
because of him.

1394
02:09:23,661 --> 02:09:25,902
How much do you want?
- Rs 10,000.

1395
02:09:26,097 --> 02:09:26,905
Take it & go.

1396
02:09:27,198 --> 02:09:28,438
I wanted to ask you...

1397
02:09:28,867 --> 02:09:33,043
Take Rs 15,000. Leave him here & go.

1398
02:09:33,571 --> 02:09:35,676
From one hell to another.

1399
02:09:36,207 --> 02:09:38,050
I was there for a year.

1400
02:09:39,010 --> 02:09:41,047
Why do you fall at my feet?

1401
02:09:41,379 --> 02:09:44,019
One day, I saw her in this hell.

1402
02:09:45,884 --> 02:09:47,761
Another family hit by poverty.

1403
02:09:48,119 --> 02:09:52,693
Come, you don't worry.
I'll take care of everything.

1404
02:09:52,891 --> 02:09:53,869
Let your children stay here & study.

1405
02:09:54,359 --> 02:09:57,238
Let them work for few hours
after studies.

1406
02:09:57,428 --> 02:10:00,068
You both go to the base of the hill
to crush stones.

1407
02:10:26,791 --> 02:10:27,496
Hey get up.

1408
02:10:29,194 --> 02:10:30,172
Get up.

1409
02:10:45,743 --> 02:10:48,622
I'll go.
I don't like to stay here.

1410
02:10:48,913 --> 02:10:51,086
I'll go to my parents.
- Sleep.

1411
02:10:52,083 --> 02:10:53,892
We can sleep only for 3 more hours.

1412
02:10:54,085 --> 02:10:56,429
If you don't sleep now, you'll feel
sleepy during work.

1413
02:10:56,754 --> 02:10:57,289
Come here.

1414
02:10:58,623 --> 02:11:01,467
Eat this & sleep.

1415
02:11:02,160 --> 02:11:03,161
This is your food.

1416
02:11:04,095 --> 02:11:05,836
You didn't eat in the evening
since you were crying.

1417
02:11:06,030 --> 02:11:08,032
That's why I kept it for you. Eat.

1418
02:11:08,533 --> 02:11:09,807
Or else you won't get sleep.

1419
02:11:14,973 --> 02:11:16,316
You can talk!

1420
02:11:17,375 --> 02:11:18,410
I thought you're dumb.

1421
02:11:26,985 --> 02:11:28,157
What's it?- Just sleep.

1422
02:11:29,587 --> 02:11:31,589
Who's he?- Don't shout.

1423
02:11:41,866 --> 02:11:46,212
Hey, Get up.

1424
02:11:48,473 --> 02:11:49,645
You said you wanted to eat
"Jilebi"(sweet).

1425
02:11:50,008 --> 02:11:51,385
I've brought it. Come.

1426
02:11:55,647 --> 02:11:58,890
I've plenty of "Jilebis". You can eat
for the next 10 days, come.

1427
02:11:59,350 --> 02:12:00,420
I'll take them tomorrow morning.

1428
02:12:02,787 --> 02:12:04,698
I'll give you now only,
come on get up.

1429
02:12:04,889 --> 02:12:07,529
No, I don't want.
- If you don't come now,

1430
02:12:07,959 --> 02:12:09,996
I'll complain to Krishnaveni madam
and get you beaten up.

1431
02:12:10,194 --> 02:12:12,105
Come...get up.- No please.

1432
02:12:15,400 --> 02:12:20,042
Don't tell about this to anyone.
Okay?- Yes.

1433
02:12:27,412 --> 02:12:28,857
How many "Jilebis"
will you give me?

1434
02:13:03,881 --> 02:13:07,158
After that, Devi never left me
alone even for a minute.

1435
02:13:08,152 --> 02:13:10,655
Even under such testing conditions,
we were very happy.

1436
02:13:12,156 --> 02:13:13,601
Devi used to talk a lot,

1437
02:13:14,359 --> 02:13:15,667
about leaving this hell
in the near future.

1438
02:13:16,394 --> 02:13:18,499
It seems, she'll marry me only
after going out from here.

1439
02:13:19,130 --> 02:13:20,575
It seems, we'll have a child,

1440
02:13:21,065 --> 02:13:22,601
...and we'll be taking care
of it very affectionately.

1441
02:13:24,702 --> 02:13:28,172
In this place, only dreams
weren't restricted.

1442
02:13:28,706 --> 02:13:30,185
Give me a fond kiss.

1443
02:13:30,942 --> 02:13:32,444
Sir, this is our school.

1444
02:13:33,444 --> 02:13:34,855
Look, how nicely they are studying.

1445
02:13:35,913 --> 02:13:38,519
They work for little time
after studies.

1446
02:13:38,916 --> 02:13:41,726
Rarely they used come to
inspect the factory.

1447
02:13:42,987 --> 02:13:46,434
Till now they used to take money
at the gate & go away.

1448
02:13:47,258 --> 02:13:49,534
But this Officer was different.

1449
02:13:50,361 --> 02:13:52,170
When I saw them getting
afraid of him...

1450
02:13:52,497 --> 02:13:53,669
I was very happy-

1451
02:13:54,065 --> 02:13:55,305
Open it! I want to see.
- Sir, that side...

1452
02:13:55,500 --> 02:13:57,502
Open it, I want to see.
- Okay, open it.

1453
02:14:01,239 --> 02:14:01,910
Bloody cheats!

1454
02:14:02,140 --> 02:14:05,986
It raised my hopes and
I told him everything.

1455
02:14:08,212 --> 02:14:09,691
Officer was in for a
windfall that day.

1456
02:14:10,348 --> 02:14:12,021
Generally one who used
to take Rs.25,000...

1457
02:14:12,550 --> 02:14:14,996
...went away silently
taking Rs.50,000.

1458
02:14:19,957 --> 02:14:22,437
Oh! Please open it.
It is burning.

1459
02:14:37,008 --> 02:14:39,079
Keep an eye, I'll come back
in few minutes.

1460
02:14:39,343 --> 02:14:41,755
Hey, Poor boy...he's very young.
- You do your work.

1461
02:14:42,180 --> 02:14:43,659
He complained against us
to the Officer, didn't he?

1462
02:14:43,948 --> 02:14:46,258
Madam is not in town,
we'll not get another chance.

1463
02:14:52,123 --> 02:14:52,760
Oh God!

1464
02:14:53,357 --> 02:14:57,430
Hey leave me... Leave...
- Don't shout.

1465
02:15:05,136 --> 02:15:07,776
Hey! What? Go away.

1466
02:15:09,140 --> 02:15:10,278
Hey, give me!

1467
02:15:19,450 --> 02:15:23,125
Get up!

1468
02:15:25,056 --> 02:15:26,399
Let's watch T.V.
Will you join me?

1469
02:15:29,193 --> 02:15:29,864
Why are you afraid?

1470
02:15:30,528 --> 02:15:33,975
Rajini, Kamal all actors will
appear on T.V.

1471
02:15:34,332 --> 02:15:35,811
It'll be very good to watch.
Come.

1472
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:36,637
No! I don't want.

1473
02:15:38,069 --> 02:15:40,049
You mustn't say like that!
I've bought "Biryani" for you.

1474
02:15:40,671 --> 02:15:41,979
You come & eat.

1475
02:15:43,641 --> 02:15:46,383
Devi, don't go!

1476
02:15:48,179 --> 02:15:50,090
Isn't it very cold out side?
Come, let's go & sleep inside.

1477
02:15:50,348 --> 02:15:51,156
No, I'll not come.

1478
02:15:51,549 --> 02:15:55,725
Hey, don't be stubborn. - No.
- What do you want? Tell me.

1479
02:15:59,991 --> 02:16:02,699
Will you release Vinod?
- Vinod?

1480
02:16:03,494 --> 02:16:05,337
He's inside this box.

1481
02:16:07,365 --> 02:16:07,843
That's all!

1482
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:10,308
Why did you ask me to do it?

1483
02:16:10,601 --> 02:16:11,579
Couldn't you've opened it yourself?

1484
02:16:12,303 --> 02:16:17,651
Vinod, what happened to you?
Vinod, get up.

1485
02:16:19,443 --> 02:16:22,686
Nothing has happened to him.
- What happened to you, Vinod?

1486
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:25,326
He'll get well...
Come on get up...come...come.

1487
02:16:26,350 --> 02:16:28,523
Come, don't cry.
Listen to me.

1488
02:16:34,892 --> 02:16:37,702
Don't go...don't...

1489
02:16:40,831 --> 02:16:42,276
Oh God! it's paining.

1490
02:17:06,290 --> 02:17:08,099
Why did you bring it here?

1491
02:17:08,426 --> 02:17:09,996
She's dead. What else do you
want me to do?

1492
02:17:10,494 --> 02:17:12,303
I've informed madam.
She'll be here any moment.

1493
02:17:15,933 --> 02:17:17,241
Bloody street dog!

1494
02:17:17,668 --> 02:17:19,841
How many times I've told you
not to touch girls here?

1495
02:17:20,304 --> 02:17:22,409
If you feel like having a women,
why don't you go out?

1496
02:17:22,873 --> 02:17:24,443
Am I not enough for your
dirty face?

1497
02:17:24,909 --> 02:17:25,751
Bloody rascal!

1498
02:17:32,483 --> 02:17:35,089
You don't worry madam,
we'll bury her in a corner.

1499
02:17:35,286 --> 02:17:36,162
Not necessary.

1500
02:17:37,054 --> 02:17:38,499
Throw it into the crusher machine.

1501
02:17:39,056 --> 02:17:41,036
Let it come out tomorrow
as mosaic paste.

1502
02:17:41,926 --> 02:17:43,337
If her parents inquire about her...

1503
02:17:44,128 --> 02:17:46,870
...tell them, we don't know about her,
she has ran away from here.

1504
02:17:47,531 --> 02:17:50,444
This is the fourth girl
to die this year.

1505
02:18:24,468 --> 02:18:28,143
Hey, open the door.
If we come out, you're finished.

1506
02:18:34,145 --> 02:18:35,215
What's it, boy? Go!

02:24:18,222 --> 02:24:22,261
Even if you come to shower
motherly affection on me,

1531
02:24:22,459 --> 02:24:25,997
I want to be born in
your lap again.

1532
02:24:26,697 --> 02:24:30,167
My life is your mercy.

1533
02:24:30,734 --> 02:24:34,341
I want to become a
pan of your life.

1534
02:24:35,105 --> 02:24:38,518
This is not love.
This is not lust.

1535
02:24:38,909 --> 02:24:43,654
There's no name for
this relationship.

1536
02:24:44,048 --> 02:24:49,048
<i>TAMILINI</i>

1537
02:25:17,815 --> 02:25:25,529
If you look at me,
I'll bloom as a new flower.

1538
02:25:25,823 --> 02:25:33,935
If you say a word of comfort,
my pain will vanish, my love.

1539
02:26:28,485 --> 02:26:28,963
Here!

1540
02:26:30,154 --> 02:26:30,689
Look back!

1541
02:26:59,349 --> 02:26:59,884
Why are you laughing?

1542
02:27:00,851 --> 02:27:02,159
What else do you want me to do?

1543
02:27:02,586 --> 02:27:04,759
When I hear all that you say,
it makes me laugh.

1544
02:27:05,022 --> 02:27:06,831
What do you know about Vinod?

1545
02:27:08,225 --> 02:27:10,933
Suddenly, you've brought me here
and say I've been kidnapped,

1546
02:27:11,161 --> 02:27:12,538
he has killed a girl,

1547
02:27:12,729 --> 02:27:14,868
and pushed Adi from a hill.

1548
02:27:15,065 --> 02:27:16,544
Have you all gone mad?

1549
02:27:16,767 --> 02:27:20,772
We're not mad, Divya.
You've blind faith in him.

1550
02:27:21,738 --> 02:27:26,016
His finger prints are
on the knife & the box.

1551
02:27:26,376 --> 02:27:29,949
Not only that, we found a dead body
3 days ago in your college.

1552
02:27:30,314 --> 02:27:32,760
Name is Seenu.
Your college mate.

1553
02:27:33,083 --> 02:27:36,292
He was pushed into a
construction pit & the pit was closed.

1554
02:27:36,553 --> 02:27:38,260
I'm suspecting Vinod
in this case also.

1555
02:27:38,722 --> 02:27:41,726
There's a report that Seenu has been
missing since the Cultural festival.

1556
02:27:42,459 --> 02:27:45,565
Do you know anything
about it? Tell me.

1557
02:27:46,563 --> 02:27:47,803
Do you know?

1558
02:27:50,567 --> 02:27:53,810
I think you'll accuse Vinod for
all murders in this State.

1559
02:27:54,004 --> 02:27:56,041
I'll go and ask Vinod directly.

1560
02:27:56,273 --> 02:27:59,720
Divya! What I'm saying is true.
Believe me!

1561
02:28:00,110 --> 02:28:01,748
He's a dangerous criminal.

1562
02:28:02,079 --> 02:28:03,581
I've full faith in him.

1563
02:28:03,814 --> 02:28:05,452
Didn't I tell you,
I'll ask him,

1564
02:28:05,649 --> 02:28:08,129
Don't talk unnecessarily
about him before that.

1565
02:28:08,852 --> 02:28:10,763
Damn it! He's a psychopath.

1566
02:28:11,388 --> 02:28:12,890
Didn't I tell you not
to abuse him.

1567
02:28:13,090 --> 02:28:15,593
Will he kill me, if I go to him?

1568
02:28:15,792 --> 02:28:17,772
If you want, come behind me and watch.

1569
02:28:18,495 --> 02:28:19,633
Divya, what he says is true.

1570
02:28:19,863 --> 02:28:21,467
Do you know what Vinod
has done to me?

1571
02:28:21,832 --> 02:28:23,106
If you accuse him,
do I've to believe you?

1572
02:28:23,300 --> 02:28:24,040
Divya, please stop it!

1573
02:28:24,234 --> 02:28:25,975
Listen to me.
You can't go there.

1574
02:28:33,744 --> 02:28:34,586
Sorry Divya.

1575
02:28:35,045 --> 02:28:36,456
I wanted you to understand him...so.

1576
02:28:36,647 --> 02:28:38,456
You don't know anything about him.

1577
02:28:38,782 --> 02:28:41,456
I've lived 3 days alone with him.

1578
02:28:41,852 --> 02:28:44,799
He could've done anything with me.

1579
02:28:45,455 --> 02:28:48,868
He took care of me
exceptionally well, why?

1580
02:28:49,526 --> 02:28:54,532
He made special arrangements
for my food, bed & bath.

1581
02:28:55,299 --> 02:29:00,214
Even now, I can hear his
voice in my ears.

1582
02:29:00,704 --> 02:29:01,808
Poor boy!

1583
02:29:02,205 --> 02:29:07,279
Do you know the hell he had
been through as a boy?

1584
02:29:08,378 --> 02:29:09,413
I'll never believe!

1585
02:29:09,813 --> 02:29:11,952
My Vinod will never
do such things.

1586
02:29:12,215 --> 02:29:13,421
I'll never believe it.

1587
02:29:14,251 --> 02:29:17,755
Tell me it was done by Adi.
I may even believe that.

1588
02:29:18,388 --> 02:29:20,959
My Vinod...
that too killing me...

1589
02:29:24,227 --> 02:29:27,436
Divya, okay...okay!

1590
02:30:09,706 --> 02:30:10,616
What's it Divya?

1591
02:30:12,409 --> 02:30:13,080
Vinod!

1592
02:30:15,512 --> 02:30:17,958
I knew he'll definitely come.

1593
02:30:24,855 --> 02:30:25,765
Where's he?

1594
02:30:32,696 --> 02:30:33,470
He was here only.

1595
02:30:37,300 --> 02:30:40,713
Divya, relax! It's okay!
Calm down!

1596
02:30:41,972 --> 02:30:45,044
No Adi, I saw him.
It was Vinod.

1597
02:30:47,978 --> 02:30:49,423
Please, don't think about the past.

1598
02:30:51,047 --> 02:30:51,525
Come.

1599
02:30:59,189 --> 02:31:00,566
Everything will be alright.

1600
02:31:45,969 --> 02:31:50,179
Divya, you don't worry.
Nothing will happen to you.

1601
02:31:50,807 --> 02:31:53,788
Didn't I tell you, it was Vinod?

1602
02:31:58,815 --> 02:32:00,726
Constables. . .C0nstables!

1603
02:32:14,631 --> 02:32:18,204
My life will become a pan
of history in time.

1604
02:32:18,401 --> 02:32:22,781
My tears will linger
on for a longer time.

1605
02:32:24,541 --> 02:32:28,580
Though you shower motherly
affection on me,

1606
02:32:28,778 --> 02:32:32,817
I want to be born again
on your lap.

1607
02:32:35,552 --> 02:32:39,261
My life is your mercy.

1608
02:32:53,803 --> 02:32:54,804
Come on Adi.

1609
02:32:56,106 --> 02:32:58,052
Jeep...jeep.
Run fast to the jeep.

1610
02:33:06,783 --> 02:33:07,955
Hurry up...hurry up...
come on.

1611
02:33:08,151 --> 02:33:09,186
Divya, run faster.

1612
02:33:09,386 --> 02:33:12,333
Come on...come...hurry up...hurry
fast...fast...

1613
02:33:23,833 --> 02:33:25,835
Adi, where's the Inspector?

1614
02:33:26,503 --> 02:33:26,981
Come!

1615
02:33:29,306 --> 02:33:31,718
Divya, come quickly...
come quickly.

1616
02:33:35,378 --> 02:33:38,587
Adi, I can't run any further.

1617
02:33:47,524 --> 02:33:50,232
We're late!
Shall we go to our house?

1618
02:34:07,310 --> 02:34:09,381
This is enough! enough...

1619
02:34:10,113 --> 02:34:13,458
If a man sneaks into a girl's bed
without his shirt at midnight...

1620
02:34:13,783 --> 02:34:15,854
Any girl will suspect.

1621
02:34:16,052 --> 02:34:19,261
But you took me onto your lap,

1622
02:34:19,456 --> 02:34:23,563
and asked me about my difficulties.
Angel!

1623
02:34:23,760 --> 02:34:27,139
The tears I shed then washed away
all my bad intentions.

1624
02:34:28,298 --> 02:34:31,336
I must be with you.
That's all.

1625
02:34:32,335 --> 02:34:33,279
If you understand that,
it's enough..

1626
02:34:34,671 --> 02:34:37,311
I'm feeling sleepy.
Please, let's go to sleep.

1627
02:35:09,739 --> 02:35:11,810
Oh my God!

1628
02:35:16,112 --> 02:35:17,955
Sorry dear! Please.

1629
02:35:18,548 --> 02:35:19,652
<i>I'm really; sorry'.</i>

1630
02:35:21,551 --> 02:35:25,795
Please no Divya...don't...
Divya, please.

1631
02:35:25,989 --> 02:35:27,491
Don't get scared of me.

1632
02:35:27,691 --> 02:35:29,671
I'm your friend Vinod.

1633
02:35:30,093 --> 02:35:32,095
Would you like to beat me
as I had slapped you?

1634
02:35:33,363 --> 02:35:34,103
Slap me!

1635
02:35:40,203 --> 02:35:43,514
Do you know how I felt when I didn't
see you when I woke up?

1636
02:35:44,541 --> 02:35:46,543
I got scared that you may've
also left me.

1637
02:35:48,144 --> 02:35:49,350
I know you Divya.

1638
02:35:50,113 --> 02:35:51,751
You would've come to know
the truth about me.

1639
02:35:52,415 --> 02:35:53,792
They would've told you.

1640
02:35:55,051 --> 02:35:56,155
I've committed murders.

1641
02:35:56,653 --> 02:35:58,860
I've cheated you by telling lies.

1642
02:35:59,189 --> 02:36:00,065
What's wrong in it?

1643
02:36:00,557 --> 02:36:02,764
To stay with my Divya,
I'll do anything.

1644
02:36:04,194 --> 02:36:06,765
What's lacking here?
What else do you want?

1645
02:36:06,963 --> 02:36:08,271
Tell me, I'll bring it.

1646
02:36:08,832 --> 02:36:10,778
But never leave me & go away.

1647
02:36:11,568 --> 02:36:12,876
I don't have anyone.

1648
02:36:13,436 --> 02:36:15,211
I'll die, if you also leave me.

1649
02:36:16,306 --> 02:36:20,118
Look...how beautiful this place is.

1650
02:36:21,010 --> 02:36:23,786
A home of our own.
Full of light!

1651
02:36:23,980 --> 02:36:25,687
A family...Children...

1652
02:36:26,449 --> 02:36:27,427
This is my dream.

1653
02:36:27,917 --> 02:36:30,591
The dream I saw looking out of
the window in my young age.

1654
02:36:31,521 --> 02:36:34,525
Do you know how much
I had yearned for this?

1655
02:36:34,724 --> 02:36:37,034
Ask this wall.

1656
02:36:37,227 --> 02:36:39,332
It'll tell how many days
I spent crying before it.

1657
02:36:41,264 --> 02:36:42,641
This is my problem.

1658
02:36:43,166 --> 02:36:45,271
When my turn comes,
nothing will materialize.

1659
02:36:45,769 --> 02:36:47,407
What great things did I hope for?

1660
02:36:48,705 --> 02:36:50,810
An ordinary life which you're living.

1661
02:36:51,441 --> 02:36:53,079
Why am I being denied that life?

1662
02:36:53,743 --> 02:36:55,620
Why everything is going the
wrong way for me?

1663
02:36:56,379 --> 02:36:58,086
What sins have I committed?

1664
02:37:00,383 --> 02:37:02,090
But I know one thing clearly,

1665
02:37:02,452 --> 02:37:03,954
you...you...you're different.

1666
02:37:04,988 --> 02:37:05,966
I'm with you.

1667
02:37:06,156 --> 02:37:07,760
I'm here to fulfill
all your wishes.

1668
02:37:07,957 --> 02:37:08,867
Why do you need others?

1669
02:37:10,093 --> 02:37:13,472
Your father, mother, Adi,
you don't need anyone.

1670
02:37:15,698 --> 02:37:17,371
Do you think you love that Adi?

1671
02:37:17,901 --> 02:37:21,849
Yuck! ...no...ugh!
That's not love!

1672
02:37:22,105 --> 02:37:24,449
He got you admitted in a
hospital that day.

1673
02:37:24,841 --> 02:37:25,842
It entitles him only for thanks.

1674
02:37:26,142 --> 02:37:28,520
Thank him, that's all!

1675
02:37:29,145 --> 02:37:31,318
Will you love him for that? Idiot!

1676
02:37:32,282 --> 02:37:34,262
The thing which is between us,
that's love.

1677
02:37:34,450 --> 02:37:35,224
True Love!

1678
02:37:35,819 --> 02:37:37,662
How you get distressed,
if I'm in trouble.

1679
02:37:38,488 --> 02:37:38,966
That's love!

1680
02:37:39,189 --> 02:37:41,601
Okay! That's it. Poor girl!

1681
02:37:41,791 --> 02:37:42,769
How can you understand this?

1682
02:37:42,959 --> 02:37:44,666
Someone must explain this to you.

1683
02:37:45,195 --> 02:37:47,141
You've understood it.
Yes! you've got it.

1684
02:37:47,730 --> 02:37:50,506
Tell me, you love only me, don't you?

1685
02:37:50,700 --> 02:37:52,611
Leave it...if you don't like.
...leave it.

1686
02:37:53,937 --> 02:37:56,213
Just tell me, you'll always
be with me. That's enough.

1687
02:37:57,006 --> 02:37:57,711
Tell me!

1688
02:37:59,108 --> 02:38:00,587
Okay...okay.
I've got it.

1689
02:38:00,777 --> 02:38:04,418
You don't want to be with me
after knowing the truth.

1690
02:38:04,614 --> 02:38:05,319
No problem!

1691
02:38:06,316 --> 02:38:09,092
I'll stay in a corner like a dog.

1692
02:38:09,986 --> 02:38:11,090
I'll never come near you.

1693
02:38:11,454 --> 02:38:12,489
If you call me, I'll come.

1694
02:38:12,689 --> 02:38:13,633
If you ask me to go,
I'll go away.

1695
02:38:14,824 --> 02:38:17,134
Isn't the happiness of seeing you
enough for me?

1696
02:38:17,527 --> 02:38:18,528
I don't want anything else.

1697
02:38:19,462 --> 02:38:22,102
Tell me at least now.
You'll stay here.

1698
02:38:22,665 --> 02:38:28,411
Tell me...tell me.

1699
02:38:28,705 --> 02:38:30,582
Will you stay or not? Tell me.

1700
02:38:37,180 --> 02:38:39,854
No...- Why?

1701
02:38:40,984 --> 02:38:41,860
Why?

1702
02:38:42,552 --> 02:38:43,428
Why?

1703
02:38:45,755 --> 02:38:50,135
Because you're my friend.
- So what?

1704
02:38:51,728 --> 02:38:55,608
I can't be with you always.- Why?

1705
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:57,705
You can't understand that!

1706
02:38:57,901 --> 02:38:59,073
No, you're not able
to understand me.

1707
02:38:59,335 --> 02:39:00,439
I was on the streets.
You turned me into a human,

1708
02:39:00,637 --> 02:39:01,911
and leaving me again on the streets.

1709
02:39:02,105 --> 02:39:03,175
You're not able to understand me.

1710
02:39:06,709 --> 02:39:10,418
Bloody fool, I had hit you on your head.
Didn't you die?

1711
02:39:11,114 --> 02:39:12,422
Isn't he the reason for all this?

1712
02:39:13,416 --> 02:39:15,054
If he hadn't crossed our path,

1713
02:39:15,518 --> 02:39:16,929
you would've always been with me,
wouldn't you?

1714
02:39:17,787 --> 02:39:19,232
You don't worry, Divya.

1715
02:39:19,422 --> 02:39:21,129
Right now, here, I'll kill him.

1716
02:39:21,891 --> 02:39:23,393
After that you can't go anywhere.

1717
02:39:23,693 --> 02:39:24,728
You must be with me only.

1718
02:39:27,063 --> 02:39:29,737
Look Divya! He's holding
my neck in front of you.

1719
02:39:34,037 --> 02:39:35,710
No, Vinod!
- You stay inside.

1720
02:41:31,921 --> 02:41:34,902
My Divya has refused to stay with me.

1721
02:41:36,392 --> 02:41:38,235
I fell in love.

1722
02:41:41,731 --> 02:41:43,233
I fell in love.

1723
02:41:59,816 --> 02:42:01,022
Why did you come here?

1724
02:42:43,226 --> 02:42:44,864
Divya, leave him.

1725
02:42:50,833 --> 02:42:54,474
Divya, he's the one responsible
for everything.

1726
02:42:54,670 --> 02:42:57,116
Leave him.
He must die.

1727
02:43:00,476 --> 02:43:03,685
Have you gone mad, Divya?

1728
02:43:04,247 --> 02:43:05,954
Can't you hear my shouts?

1729
02:43:06,549 --> 02:43:10,520
We both are going to die for him.
Leave him...
